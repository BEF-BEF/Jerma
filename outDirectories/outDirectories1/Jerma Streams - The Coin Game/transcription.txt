[0.38s -> 7.75s]  I typically greet everybody in the live audience, so I typically greet, but today is going to be a
[7.75s -> 13.90s]  little different. If you're watching the VOD right now, welcome to the VOD. Welcome to this piece of
[13.90s -> 20.90s]  recorded content. Those of you that couldn't watch live, welcome to the stream. VOD watchers.
[21.46s -> 33.83s]  Everybody else? You get greeted every day. Well, three days a week, four days a week. Sometimes
[33.83s -> 46.66s]  we have to reach out to the VOD watchers, so say hello to them right now. How you doing guys? How
[46.66s -> 57.43s]  are you? Welcome to another stream. I'm looking forward to this one. I did not realize what this
[57.43s -> 65.22s]  game was until I really took a look at it. We're playing like a Chuck E. Cheese simulator today.
[65.86s -> 77.24s]  This is going to be probably my favorite game of the year. I'm not going to lie. This is an arcade
[77.24s -> 89.03s]  simulator where you go into an arcade and you try to win tickets. My voice sounds deeper? If it is,
[89.03s -> 99.70s]  probably is. Sometimes I get a little froggy. It'll perk up. Don't worry. I should play Gary's mod.
[101.54s -> 108.68s]  No, I played Gary's mod like 15 times in like 2013. I think that was all I needed to do.
[110.36s -> 119.37s]  You sound like you're about to cry. No, I sound like a broadcaster in the car. Maybe I should
[120.25s -> 127.83s]  try out for NPR. We all know the criteria for trying out for NPR. We're being on NPR.
[128.39s -> 136.09s]  It's sounding like you're just a little too close to your microphone. I should get the job.
[142.07s -> 146.31s]  Anyways, it's called the coin game. I am a little froggy this afternoon, am I?
[147.80s -> 150.92s]  I promised I wasn't at like a football game yesterday screaming.
[154.41s -> 160.70s]  That's what I did on my days off. Yeah. I had painted my whole body the color of the team and
[160.70s -> 168.39s]  just was screaming at the other team. But anyways, tomorrow, there's no stream tomorrow
[169.03s -> 175.80s]  because I have a meeting tomorrow for the carnival stream. So that is really picking up now.
[183.82s -> 194.33s]  So we'll go along today. Chat is moving so fast. Chat's moving so fast. It really is.
[194.89s -> 200.01s]  But I do want to reiterate one more time something I mentioned a couple weeks ago is that
[200.09s -> 205.45s]  streams are going to have to pull back a little over the next four to six weeks.
[206.17s -> 210.97s]  I'm trying to do double time here on this. But there's a lot of moving parts on this stream
[210.97s -> 216.17s]  in particular that I'm going to give you the company explanation as to why there's going to
[216.17s -> 222.57s]  be like three streams a week rather than four company explanation. Very let me get close to
[222.57s -> 228.89s]  the mic to make sure this is really taken for real here. Company consideration. Reasons why.
[229.77s -> 236.76s]  Thank you for listening. Anywho, let's go. I've already tweeted. I've already got like the
[236.76s -> 247.35s]  fucking frog voice. Here it is the coin game. The footlong sub is no longer five dollars.
[252.14s -> 258.44s]  I hate to be the one to tell you this, but Subway is going to close forever within 10 years.
[259.32s -> 264.63s]  I just I'm just telling you that this is what I think to be the truth. So instead of so the
[264.63s -> 276.92s]  footlong sub is gone. Subway is going to be gone. It's not going to happen. Trust me. Ten years
[276.92s -> 284.54s]  from now, they'll get replaced by Bank of America's. Don't worry. Here we go. Choose your player.
[284.54s -> 292.78s]  Hold on. Male clothing. Let's see. Can I have different kind of clothes? That's me.
[295.37s -> 304.17s]  It's a locked button. I got to get the unlockable clothes. Well, that's not without the glasses.
[304.17s -> 312.01s]  That's me. I don't wear. I'm no, I don't do horizontal stripes. I'm just white t-shirt
[312.01s -> 321.29s]  and jeans guy. Yeah, that's fine. A birthday mode? What? There's a survival mode and a
[321.29s -> 328.15s]  birthday mode. A birthday party just for you. Fun and relax so you can just play the games.
[328.15s -> 334.25s]  When money runs out, just hit up the money grabber. Teleport around an island from smartwatch.
[334.81s -> 346.23s]  No health? No. What do you mean this health? No curfews or parents. Oh no, it's not ready.
[346.87s -> 357.86s]  In survival, you work odd jobs to scavenge to earn money, pawn your prizes and get cash.
[360.44s -> 367.30s]  My parents just don't understand. Your rich uncle Phil has rented the arcade. You can act like the
[367.30s -> 373.24s]  brats that you are. Go ahead. Money's no object. Also, feel free to check out the entire island
[373.24s -> 384.26s]  and your... Stop. Hey, kids, relax. Everybody's going to get $5 worth of tokens. There's no reason
[384.26s -> 391.05s]  to scream. No one's going to get any more than anybody else. All right. Now settle down.
[391.77s -> 397.16s]  That's when you throw all the tokens in the air and like all the kids, they start freaking out.
[397.16s -> 409.22s]  Everyone's trying to grab as many as they can. See? All right. Let's go. Does it delete any saves?
[415.72s -> 423.86s]  Oh, that's fine. Let's rile up these kids. Okay, kids. Yeah. No, no, no, no, no, no. Everyone's
[423.86s -> 427.46s]  going to get the same amount of tokens except for there's going to be one person that gets
[427.46s -> 435.75s]  10 extra tokens. If they can scream the loudest starting right now. I could be like, I could,
[435.75s -> 445.03s]  I could rile up like people. It's like the first thing you don't... I'm the person that the parents
[445.03s -> 453.02s]  are like, the worker at the place is just like, uh, hold on. This is the worker. Happy birthday.
[453.02s -> 463.45s]  Rowdy. Enter here. Click grab? Wait, this is a new text message. Tab is to look at your text.
[464.25s -> 469.72s]  Happy birthday, kid. Hey, thank you for purchasing the coin game. We're extremely grateful. Well,
[469.72s -> 474.73s]  this is Uncle Phil. Being a new favorite time waster. You can always refer to this menu for
[474.73s -> 478.17s]  all your received messages and all info about the current game. Below this message,
[478.17s -> 481.37s]  you'll find a small helper message that explains a little about how to use the player controller
[481.37s -> 486.63s]  in machines. If you enjoy the game, please consider giving a positive review on the steam store page
[486.63s -> 489.67s]  and help further development of the coin game through early access development.
[490.23s -> 501.53s]  Thanks, Uncle Phil. I ain't clicking that. I'm not going to click that. Uh, smartwatch tutorial.
[501.53s -> 506.81s]  Let's just take a look at this real quick. You've obviously found the smartwatch menu and know how
[506.81s -> 509.61s]  to read the messages. Here you will find five menus that will help you through your coin game.
[509.61s -> 514.74s]  Okay. So the info menu. Uh, so the top left to check the balance of your health remaining
[514.74s -> 518.90s]  curfew time and job. We don't need to do that. That's not in the game yet. Coin balance,
[518.90s -> 524.52s]  tickets and bus pass balances. Okay. So that's like our top left of this one's balance.
[524.52s -> 529.90s]  It's really all we need to know because we're on birthday mode. Uh, you must eat and drink
[529.90s -> 541.99s]  to keep this up through the day or you will die. Why can you die in this game? That seems a little
[541.99s -> 548.41s]  much. I'm going to say. Yeah. Yeah. We don't, this is all survival stuff. We're not doing that.
[548.41s -> 553.13s]  It's not ready. All right. This is the messages. This, uh, menu will write you, right? It'll store
[553.13s -> 557.53s]  all the messages from the game. You cannot delete them. Right. Map menu. This is the top down
[557.53s -> 576.31s]  mini map of the whole island. I'm going to click it. What? Why is this so big? This seems very
[576.31s -> 588.23s]  elaborate. Larry's arcade. Okay. Well, so that's, uh, yeah, it has a little major locations marked
[588.23s -> 590.79s]  for you to explore, including your current position and the current position of the
[590.79s -> 596.31s]  Islandville bus and all seven bus stops on the island. You can also check the progress
[596.31s -> 601.03s]  of delivering papers by checking the amount of red mailboxes that have yet to be delivered.
[601.75s -> 607.78s]  Okay. Uh, 12 spot inventory backpack for you to carry things around the island. Simply click
[607.78s -> 612.82s]  the pick up button on an object to add it to your inventory. Right. And then click the image of it
[612.82s -> 619.64s]  in your inventory menu to drop it. Okay. Simple. Once it is full, you have to drop an item in order
[619.64s -> 625.64s]  to have a new one. And then these are stats. Got it. Uncle Phil, you need some more money.
[626.60s -> 632.82s]  You need some more money. If you run out of money, you can always go into the VIP birthday
[632.82s -> 638.02s]  room and get them in the free money blower machine. I took care of Larry and told him to
[638.02s -> 650.25s]  make sure it is full whenever you need any money. What the fuck? Imagine, imagine being like the
[650.25s -> 661.00s]  janitor here and you just see the kid. Hey, hey, uh, hey, janitor, uh, Joe. Yeah. You got to fill
[661.00s -> 666.49s]  up the money machine. Uncle Phil's little shit. Kid's going to go in there and just grab hundreds.
[667.96s -> 680.06s]  Okay. Like what? What? Just to put, just, just put it in his checking account. You don't have to do
[680.06s -> 691.10s]  this shit. Barry's pawn shop. Come on down to Barry's pawn shop located at the flashing yellow light
[691.10s -> 697.18s]  in the main hallway, main highway. We'll buy anything. We also have a vending machine for you
[697.18s -> 702.06s]  hungry young whippersnappers. Take the bus to stop number five and we are right across the street.
[702.06s -> 708.92s]  Open 24 hours. Okay. All right. I think I understand how it's going on. Let's go.
[713.80s -> 737.14s]  The audio is a little low. Okay. Key F inventory. What? Can I, can I pick this guy up? Wait, why
[737.14s -> 743.38s]  can I, I can drop already a full letter grade. Oh yeah. It's a full letter grade already. That's
[743.38s -> 753.30s]  cool. Why would I be able to do this in this game? How old am I supposed to be?
[758.52s -> 773.74s]  Zoom out? Press tab to lean forward. Wait, why is there a, why is there a gun?
[779.37s -> 846.02s]  Is there, oh, it's a beach. Why is this sub training? GPS is just like, well, you're in the
[846.02s -> 854.41s]  middle of the fucking ocean. Whoa. Oh, we found the wall. This invisible wall. We found it.
[868.46s -> 887.32s]  Phil, Phil, I need help. I don't have, I do have a flashlight. What the fuck did I just shoot?
[890.10s -> 925.66s]  Am I still in the water? What's that noise? You hear that? Follow the moon. Where's my GPS? Okay.
[925.66s -> 939.29s]  How do I just read, let's just read it again. Your golf cart has been towed to your home garage.
[942.39s -> 945.83s]  Oh wait, that's right. I can't teleport because this is the joke mode, right? This is just the
[945.83s -> 961.27s]  birthday mode. Oh, it's that easy. Wow. Okay. What? All right. There's too many things to look at
[961.27s -> 964.23s]  here. Let's go. Let's go. Hold on. Look, there's a construction yard over there.
[965.03s -> 999.13s]  I'm supposed to be playing ticket games. Where are we going? Wait, is that, that thing's moving
[999.13s -> 1010.34s]  around. Can I take the truck? If I can drive this truck, that'd be pretty awesome actually.
[1010.34s -> 1042.12s]  I can't drive the truck. What the hell? What is this? Power. What? Why can I do that?
[1047.11s -> 1053.91s]  Is it police? Why is this an open world like beat up pedestrian game? I don't understand.
[1054.47s -> 1084.79s]  It's my birthday. Oh, thank you. Thank you everybody. No, no, no, no. Thank you. What? I
[1084.79s -> 1091.08s]  love this. This is awesome. I wanted to go to like Dave and Buster's too. I was thinking about it.
[1091.08s -> 1096.76s]  I want to go to Chuck E. Cheese. There's like, there's like five Chuck E. Cheese's. All right.
[1096.76s -> 1103.80s]  Which one do I want to do first? I don't have to go anywhere. This is perfect. Okay. How do I play?
[1104.52s -> 1111.45s]  I have to scan my Chuck E. Cheese card. Am I supposed to be a robot? Yeah, I don't know.
[1111.45s -> 1118.78s]  I have like normal hands. All right. So I got 50 bucks. How much does it cost to play?
[1119.66s -> 1134.17s]  A dollar to play? Shit. Here we go. 20 tickets. 50 tickets.
[1142.25s -> 1149.53s]  Very, very loud. That hurt my head. Try again. No, I'm going to flip. Let me see the other ones.
[1150.33s -> 1154.12s]  How much? So how many tickets do I have? How did I get zero?
[1154.12s -> 1177.83s]  Nope. 70 tickets. All right. Hold on. I'm going to get stuck here. I know I am. But let me like
[1177.83s -> 1188.41s]  drop that audio. It's too loud. Sound effects. That shit was just out of control. What about
[1188.41s -> 1195.32s]  this one? How much is this one? Drop coin with E. Aim. This is just one of the coin pushing games.
[1196.04s -> 1201.90s]  I'm going to irritate people so much because I'm never going to leave. I remember Kim and I one
[1201.90s -> 1208.78s]  time went to an arcade and we became like psychotically obsessed with these machines.
[1209.42s -> 1217.02s]  We sat there for like three hours. Okay. So what am I going to go? I want to get the money thing,
[1217.02s -> 1234.42s]  right? What do you mean we? Yeah, no, no, that was very much a we scenario. How can you be bad at
[1234.42s -> 1238.10s]  the coin game? I'm not bad. What do you mean bad at coin game? How many, how many credits?
[1239.14s -> 1252.54s]  How much did this cost? A dollar? There's a game show in the UK based off of these coins.
[1253.50s -> 1265.10s]  It's stuck. I have to, how do I shake the machine? Can I punch the machine?
[1268.44s -> 1274.31s]  All right, here we go. I have to get at least one satisfying push.
[1274.95s -> 1287.56s]  Fuck. It's going to take a while. I got to get bingo. There it is. Single?
[1288.76s -> 1293.54s]  That makes what? Oh, it's coins. Coins.
[1296.38s -> 1302.50s]  Yeah, that's what I meant to say. Coins. All right, hold on. Here we go. This is going to be
[1302.50s -> 1319.66s]  satisfying. Watch this. Almost. I got to tell Kim about this one. Come on, get it. Come on.
[1324.02s -> 1328.73s]  I got to get that S. I'm not going to leave until I hit the S. Wait, this might be good.
[1329.88s -> 1343.80s]  Got it. Five bucks. It only just crunches as loud as it can in your ear. Okay, we're good.
[1346.50s -> 1351.83s]  Five dollar bill in there. Why am I, I'm just holding the tickets. All right, I didn't get the
[1351.83s -> 1366.20s]  S. So I, final push. No, no, no, no, no. Put the money back in. I want to do it again. Do it again.
[1367.59s -> 1378.41s]  Yes. Okay. I'm up right now. I want to get the stapler, whatever that is. Get the fidget spinner.
[1378.41s -> 1394.92s]  I'm going to, I'm going to clean this whole thing up. I need that S. Give me the S. Give me the S.
[1395.00s -> 1405.54s]  I just need the S so that I can move on after I get the fidget spinner. Got it. Okay, here we go.
[1406.18s -> 1417.98s]  Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. 40 tickets. All right, what's that, a walkie talkie?
[1420.84s -> 1424.04s]  Yeah, it is really fucking loud. I'm going to, I'm going to do you guys a favor here. Hold on.
[1428.31s -> 1440.04s]  I'm turning it way fucking down, like way down. And then I'm going to turn the music up. That
[1440.04s -> 1467.37s]  should help. How's that? Better? No, it's too low. How about that? That's probably a little bit
[1467.37s -> 1474.30s]  better. Wait, wait, where, where am I going to get the lighter? Why is there a Zippo lighter in like
[1474.30s -> 1483.19s]  a kid's Chuck E. Cheese? I don't understand that. $2.50. All right, let me get the fidget spinner
[1483.19s -> 1494.82s]  and then we can get out of here. Let me get coins one more time. And so the kids can smoke.
[1494.82s -> 1511.88s]  I'm going to get a lot from here. Nice. Come on, do it. Do it again. Lighter? It's a, what do
[1511.88s -> 1520.55s]  you mean lighter? It's a, no, that, that's a, like a nail file. The other thing was a lighter.
[1523.24s -> 1530.79s]  Got it. Okay. Something big. It's not that bad. Just put, put the lighter back up there. Did I
[1530.79s -> 1538.14s]  take it? I need the fidget spinner or chat will literally never let me leave. Don't you understand
[1538.14s -> 1544.78s]  guys, this community, if I don't get the fidget spinner six months from now, someone's going to
[1544.78s -> 1551.34s]  have their username be German lied about the fidget spinner. You understand? Like people will
[1551.34s -> 1554.14s]  say, Hey, when are you going to get the fidget spinner? Are you going to like go back to the
[1554.14s -> 1562.82s]  coin machine to get the fidget spinner? And I'll be like, no, and it'll just become a thing. I have
[1562.82s -> 1575.06s]  to get that. It's already taken. So you see somebody is preparing. There's no way in hell
[1575.06s -> 1581.08s]  that somebody could have made that username as fast as I just said that. So somebody was already
[1581.08s -> 1592.47s]  preparing. My point has been proven. I don't even need to say anything else. I just have to get this
[1592.47s -> 1605.93s]  stupid fucking fidget spinner. Oh, that was, that was the mother load. How many, how many tickets
[1606.01s -> 1618.55s]  is that? All right. I almost got it. I almost got it. There it is. It's right there. It's so close.
[1621.26s -> 1626.70s]  Got it. Yeah. All right. Now nobody can say shit. Now you got to remake another new username.
[1636.36s -> 1646.33s]  Get the knife. I already got the knife. That's just hanging on. Hold on. Look at this. How many
[1646.33s -> 1659.61s]  tickets are coming off? I just want to get the middle one. I don't even care. It's a dollar.
[1659.61s -> 1663.61s]  I have $55. I'm just going to span. I got it. Okay. I got it. That's all I wanted.
[1664.25s -> 1673.50s]  I don't want anything else. By the way, this is the worst strategy when you're playing one
[1673.50s -> 1681.98s]  of these machines. I'm going to get coins again though. All right. Something big. Oh my fucking
[1681.98s -> 1698.30s]  God. Oh my fucking God. I did it. Okay. Let me see if I can get the middle lighter again.
[1698.30s -> 1710.52s]  Strategic drops here. Got it. Come on. Look at that. Look at that. Perfect drop.
[1713.69s -> 1726.20s]  I'm pretty good I think. I think I cleaned out that one. All right. What else is there? Cool.
[1726.20s -> 1729.48s]  How much money do I have? 60 bucks. I got more than what I came in with.
[1730.52s -> 1736.94s]  My investment in Chuck E Cheese is going pretty well. Oh shit. Right. How many tickets?
[1737.90s -> 1750.86s]  That's a lot. I literally played Big Bass as a kid. Yeah. What does he say? What is it? I got
[1750.86s -> 1756.46s]  it in my head somewhere. It's in there somewhere. Oh yeah. That's a good fish now. Something like
[1756.46s -> 1764.98s]  that. What is it? It's here somewhere. Let me find it. Come on. It's in there somewhere. Oh,
[1764.98s -> 1768.34s]  don't you know that's going to be a big pull now. It's going to happen. Just trust me. It was
[1768.34s -> 1794.95s]  something like that. Did I do it? Hold the handle. Oh. 15 tickets. Come on. This thing's expensive
[1794.95s -> 1800.07s]  too. It's always the most expensive thing in the whole arcade. How much is it? It's a dollar. All
[1800.07s -> 1813.83s]  right. Let's do it again. Oh, you got yourself 40 tickets. I have to find one on YouTube and I'll
[1813.83s -> 1821.10s]  play it. Oh, 40 tickets. Don't you know? No, this game is a scam. Fuck this game.
[1833.32s -> 1846.30s]  No, I don't want to see like an actual Big Bass. Let's see if I was right.
[1850.23s -> 1856.55s]  Does it? Come on. Let's see what she can do here. Okay. Let's keep an eye on things.
[1856.55s -> 1859.59s]  I just want to hear. No, I want it. Now this is YouTube. This YouTube channel is about playing
[1859.59s -> 1913.32s]  arcade games. I didn't even know that. Big Bass arcade voice. Do it. Oh, you got 100 tickets. I
[1913.32s -> 1925.72s]  told I was right. No, no, I'm not playing that one. Give me my tickets. Let's get the hell out of
[1925.72s -> 1930.12s]  here. I remember this one. Wait, let's see. We got to go in order. I can't just run around like a
[1930.12s -> 1945.82s]  child. In order. Treasure in the sand. 50 cents for one. I never played this one before. How does
[1945.82s -> 1963.83s]  this one work? Use joystick to move arm and knock off coins. Like what? What's my time limit?
[1963.83s -> 1972.55s]  This is just like a bunch of hit markers. I just called in like the AC 130 in Call of Duty.
[1981.90s -> 1992.42s]  Okay, game sucks. I don't want to play it again. Dumb. Oh, don't go. What do they got here?
[1994.94s -> 2009.86s]  It's a coin machine. I like that. I'm gonna get the cards and I'll be fine.
[2011.96s -> 2020.12s]  It's another one. Yeah, but these ones are fun. I can only get one dunko with three cards and then
[2020.12s -> 2039.99s]  I won't do it ever again. Come on. Give me the dew. Got it. Got the end. Oh, perfect. Yes. All right, 500.
[2041.88s -> 2051.38s]  I'll take 60 tickets. That sounds good to me now. Be a good sport. Play again. He does that too. We might have to
[2051.38s -> 2075.11s]  listen to that. Oh, you got eight tickets now. But honestly though, that machine. Fuck that machine.
[2075.67s -> 2079.99s]  That machine's stupid. Not because it's in this game. Like it's cool to have that in the game.
[2079.99s -> 2085.94s]  That thing is always like six bucks. It's like four to six dollars to spend that thing
[2087.37s -> 2099.40s]  at every arcade I've ever been to. All right, I'm gonna get them all right here. You know, they make
[2099.40s -> 2105.86s]  these for adults in Vegas. They don't make this shit like this in a slot machine. If this was real
[2105.86s -> 2112.23s]  money, that would be pretty fucking fun. No, I don't want to sit there and spin like the one-cent
[2112.23s -> 2123.53s]  machine. I want to put like quarters in here and have the quarters come out. Oh, come on. What'd I
[2123.53s -> 2132.31s]  get? Dunk again. Yeah. But what did I get? What was that? Was it just eight tickets? Eight tickets?
[2145.00s -> 2163.08s]  Yeah, I know about pachinko machines, but hold on. All right. Aren't pachinko... Can't you not do it
[2163.08s -> 2167.56s]  with real money? Isn't it kind of like you pay and you get like these balls and you can get...
[2167.56s -> 2175.70s]  You can essentially do the... It's like ticket redemption. Yeah. Imagine these were just like
[2175.70s -> 2192.62s]  silver dollars in here and you got them. I don't know what those are doing. All right, let me go
[2192.62s -> 2202.42s]  for this last one. Yeah, some casinos in Vegas still have the old coin machines, but they're
[2202.42s -> 2213.26s]  not a thing anymore. Come on. Shit. All right, I'm giving up. I don't care about it. No, I don't care.
[2213.26s -> 2216.94s]  I don't care. So look, I set it up. I set it up for somebody else. Some lucky kid's going to come
[2216.94s -> 2232.82s]  over and get that. No, I've set it up for somebody. What's my inventory? I have an empty backpack.
[2234.63s -> 2243.26s]  How's that possible? Anything good? No. All right. What's this? No, that's rankings. It's a ranking
[2243.26s -> 2272.87s]  system. Hold on, guys. I'm trying to open a jar. Hold on. I can't do it. I'm trying. Kim came in.
[2272.87s -> 2276.47s]  She wanted me to open a jar for her because I'm trying to get strong, but I'm not strong enough.
[2276.47s -> 2284.58s]  I'm trying. No, I can. I can do this and I'm going to do it. Hold on. I need like a grip.
[2285.38s -> 2296.06s]  Yeah. Give me that. Give me that thing. Face cam. I don't have any clothes on. I can't put a face
[2296.06s -> 2314.26s]  cam on. I'm going to get this. Yeah, I got it. All right. You're welcome. That was fucking impossible.
[2314.26s -> 2332.04s]  Thank you. All right. What would we do? Mountain Dew. Is that what we're going to get? How much
[2332.04s -> 2341.38s]  these cost? Oh, I can get one of these. You can actually, can I drink them? Oh, which one? I always
[2341.38s -> 2345.56s]  go right in the middle because for some reason, everybody that uses these machines, they do the
[2345.56s -> 2351.43s]  first two or they do the bottom two. So you know how you get, that's not that. Wait, hold on. I'm
[2351.43s -> 2356.68s]  just coming to a realization here. If nobody presses the middle button, doesn't that mean that
[2356.68s -> 2362.52s]  the freshest ones are not in the middle? You should always do the top one because that's one
[2362.52s -> 2384.33s]  that gets filled, right? Fuck. I've been doing it wrong the whole time. Jesus. Well, you slammed
[2384.33s -> 2393.77s]  that one. Do you guys do redemption here? Can I get five cents for this? What the hell? Oh, no,
[2393.77s -> 2397.61s]  no, no. I'm not ready for that yet. One point ticket. Oh, wait. Ticket redemption center.
[2399.08s -> 2402.76s]  Oh yeah. That's right. You put this in and then you feed the tickets in.
[2402.76s -> 2421.58s]  169 tickets. Cool. All right. Oh no, not this thing again. This, that thing seriously ruined
[2421.58s -> 2433.66s]  my entire childhood. Prize master. Wait, there's a show going on in there? Not yet. Not yet. Hold
[2433.66s -> 2437.91s]  on. Wait, I need to play the games first. Oh, isn't it? Yeah, this is the one we have to push
[2437.91s -> 2450.68s]  the thing perfectly into the slot, right? Okay. Let's try it. How does he, how do you start it?
[2451.24s -> 2468.52s]  Start it. How do I go up? Oh, what? No, no, no, no. Okay. So you have to move it and then you have
[2468.52s -> 2484.22s]  to hold to, and then you have to release. All right. Let's do it again. Right there. Shit.
[2491.69s -> 2494.41s]  This is fucking expensive. This is really expensive.
[2509.26s -> 2528.98s]  One more. Get it? It's right there. I can do it. This is actually the worst machine in the
[2528.98s -> 2533.93s]  whole entire arcade play. It really is. They also do have one where you blow up a balloon
[2535.75s -> 2540.25s]  and you never play that one either. I don't even know why that's in the arcade.
[2540.25s -> 2561.75s]  No one touches it. I think that's it. I got it. How much is it? How many tickets? Oh no,
[2561.75s -> 2575.29s]  I don't want to play again. 100 tickets. What a dog shit prize for five bucks.
[2578.73s -> 2585.96s]  Just wait, just wait till you guys get the chance to play this one. I can't wait for that. It's
[2585.96s -> 2600.09s]  going to be so much fun. All right, let's go 500 right here. You got to let me do the thing
[2600.09s -> 2610.55s]  where I turn and look into the side like everybody does. I think that's it. I think I got it. Which
[2610.55s -> 2629.18s]  one is that? 10 tickets? Come on. Do it again. Just watch the edge. I should be able to get it.
[2640.31s -> 2661.19s]  Well, I broke it. I broke it. Hey, I got a free game. You notice that? I'm going to get that one
[2661.19s -> 2673.62s]  right there. 500 tickets. I got it. Oh, sick. Thank you. Why am I doing this so many times?
[2673.62s -> 2689.40s]  How many times am I going to do this? Another 500. 500,000. It seems easier than it should be.
[2689.96s -> 2700.15s]  There's a hundred over here. Why do I get to do this so many times? Give me the hundred.
[2700.15s -> 2714.78s]  The claw is actually clawing things. I know. Weird, right? Wait, what? I have to actually pick them
[2714.78s -> 2728.79s]  out of here? Get out. It's 500. It is 500. It's 500. Get out of here. Somebody just said that's
[2728.79s -> 2739.45s]  five. No, it was 500. Get out of here. It's my birthday, not yours. I know this one, too. This
[2739.45s -> 2749.80s]  one's awful. Okay, let's do this one. Same deal, but with rings. Let's try to get the hundred in
[2749.80s -> 2765.91s]  the corner. I think now. No? Well, I'll take 25. You piece of shit. I'm just going to go in. I'm
[2765.91s -> 2770.42s]  going to try to feed it through the middle of these two right here. There's a 50 right there,
[2770.42s -> 2779.66s]  too. It might work. Let's ring it through. Come on, get like four of them. Oh, this is a freak out
[2779.66s -> 2789.05s]  scenario. If I was a kid, aw. You pick up three things at the same time, you are more likely to
[2789.05s -> 2805.85s]  get struck by lightning than have that happen to a claw game. Nice. All right. Should be able to
[2805.85s -> 2813.48s]  feed through. What's the green? Is the green 500? Oh, shit. All right. I'll take the hundred.
[2814.20s -> 2821.24s]  The green's 500. Get the green. Oh, no, no more. I got enough. I got enough money.
[2826.25s -> 2829.21s]  Yeah, this one sucks. I'm going to get stuck here for like at least 20 minutes.
[2830.01s -> 2836.86s]  This is the one where you have to gently tap the spring to make it so it almost gets all
[2836.86s -> 2852.34s]  the way but doesn't go all the way. So how do I do it? Where did it go? Can I get a better view?
[2853.14s -> 2864.76s]  I want a better view of this. Okay. How to play. Find the green light. That's where you want to
[2864.76s -> 2888.66s]  get the green light. Press and hold. Green lights up. I can't see it. Do it again. Yeah, you want
[2888.66s -> 2894.22s]  it to land on the... Okay, you want to land right there. But I also want to be able to... I want a
[2894.22s -> 2910.79s]  better view. Get it. Get it. Oh, that's too bad. Do it again. It's all the way up. Oh, shit. Too much.
[2912.76s -> 2924.98s]  Another hundred tickets. I like this one. Where's the green? Where is it? On the other side. All
[2924.98s -> 2936.84s]  right. It's like in the middle top right. Oh, whatever. 20 tickets. I'll take it. How much money
[2936.84s -> 2952.46s]  do I have? All right. Right there. All right. Come on. Ready? No. I have to get it at least once.
[2953.78s -> 2965.51s]  Right there again. 100. It's fine. I could probably do this noise perfectly.
[2967.62s -> 2986.55s]  I'm getting a lot of tickets though. It's 2,500 tickets. Damn it. Too hard. Make the noise. I'll
[2986.55s -> 3004.28s]  try. I gotta get away from the mic because it's gonna be loud. The first one was perfect.
[3004.52s -> 3026.84s]  Okay. Come on. I have to get this one time. All right. I refuse to move on until I do this.
[3026.84s -> 3044.97s]  You understand? You understand? I will call Uncle Phil and have him deposit five grand into my
[3044.97s -> 3070.60s]  checking account. That sound is easy to make. You just have to go. Uncle Phil. Look at this shit.
[3070.60s -> 3078.55s]  It was always so fun to see that. You always got jealous of that motherfucker. When you walked by
[3078.55s -> 3082.39s]  and that person was sitting there with their hands on their hips like, oh yeah, well the thing just
[3082.39s -> 3088.89s]  spit out hundreds of these tickets. Like I primed it. I prepped that fucking thing for you.
[3094.25s -> 3098.33s]  It takes like 20 minutes and they don't even pick them up. They just let them pile up like this.
[3111.37s -> 3116.09s]  Guys, it's 2,500 tickets. I have to do that. I have to get the PlayStation 4.
[3123.85s -> 3133.03s]  Come on. Come on. I just need to do this once. Same spot. A little bit harder.
[3134.07s -> 3142.34s]  That's the one. No, it's not. I had it. That's the easiest one to get.
[3142.98s -> 3158.20s]  Find the green light. Right there.
[3183.22s -> 3184.66s]  I have to do this.
[3192.71s -> 3213.08s]  Who cares? I care. I do. It's not close. Imagine going into an arcade and I'm standing there.
[3215.22s -> 3219.46s]  I'm hogging the machine right now. There are children that want to play this.
[3220.10s -> 3233.62s]  Children. And I'm like leaning in and like lifting my legs up. Oh, whoa, almost. Can I try?
[3237.11s -> 3247.67s]  Just turn and look at them. I can get this. I can do this. Excuse me, sir. Can I play?
[3250.07s -> 3263.26s]  And turn and just fucking yell that over there. I don't even know where it is.
[3280.66s -> 3286.25s]  What a psycho. Going in. How much money do I have left?
[3287.83s -> 3297.72s]  I'm kind of like sicko millionaire. Like goes in here with like 500 bucks to.
[3297.72s -> 3301.64s]  No, I've got to hit the green. I've got to do it. I don't give a shit about this.
[3301.64s -> 3307.80s]  It's just not even real currency. I don't care. I plan on just walking by and throwing this in the
[3307.80s -> 3330.63s]  trash. Just a few more. You can afford a Tootsie Roll and an eraser. Yeah, I can get a box of nerds.
[3331.51s -> 3339.82s]  Don't worry, guys. Only eight grand worth of these gets you the PlayStation 4.
[3339.98s -> 3346.04s]  I can also get a sticky hand, too. Why have arcade even like Dave and Buster's does this?
[3346.04s -> 3350.68s]  And I don't know why. Is there some kind of weird racket? Weird, like cornered market with
[3350.68s -> 3357.80s]  ticket prizes? It's always like fucking sticky hands, Tootsie Rolls, like the finger traps,
[3358.44s -> 3366.23s]  shitty stuffed animals, and weird alcoholic joke shit that nobody ever uses.
[3366.23s -> 3390.09s]  I don't want that. What do you mean what? The ones that like the it's the top is
[3390.09s -> 3397.22s]  look like it looks like an hourglass. It's it's empty at the top empty at the bottom.
[3397.22s -> 3404.47s]  You flip it. You can take a shot either way. It's real jokey. You guys have never seen that before?
[3404.47s -> 3414.01s]  What are you talking about? This is the one. That's the one. That's the one. This is the one.
[3414.89s -> 3431.83s]  I hate you. I hate you, game. Oh my fucking god. I'm not leaving.
[3437.13s -> 3440.41s]  The ground is going to be tickets more than ground. I don't care. How much money do I have?
[3441.13s -> 3458.44s]  I have a dollar left. Uh oh. How do I call uncle? I have to get it right now. Shit. No. All right.
[3458.44s -> 3475.13s]  Just hold on. Let me get some more money. Nobody touched those. How do I get more money? I have to
[3475.13s -> 3493.59s]  go to the money machine, right? Just making sure. Tickets. Tickets. No. No. Where's the
[3494.55s -> 3520.97s]  where's the money machine? All right. How do I get more money from uh from Dr. Phil? Whatever
[3520.97s -> 3540.50s]  his name is. VIP birthday room. Okay. I need to go to the VIP birthday room. I thought this was the
[3540.50s -> 3586.06s]  VIP birthday room. Watch out. Little Jacob has to go into the money machine, guys. I'm not even
[3586.06s -> 3600.52s]  part of the party. Is this all I care about? All right. I took my shower. Is this how like
[3600.52s -> 3636.62s]  billionaires take showers? Just wet one dollar bills. I gotta turn it up. New song. No. New
[3636.62s -> 3659.93s]  song. Whoop. I think I just killed someone. What? What happened? It's shining flashly. All right.
[3659.93s -> 3674.31s]  What else is over here? Is that it? Little goodie bags. Ooh. Cheesy poops. Why did I even buy a
[3674.31s -> 3710.54s]  drink? I want to do a money shower again. Is this some other kid's birthday party? I think I could
[3710.54s -> 3720.01s]  do if these existed I think I would be really good at it. I think I could get almost every single one
[3720.01s -> 3726.54s]  of these. If I had to take a bet, hey you give me a hundred bucks and you go in there and you try to
[3726.54s -> 3734.55s]  get as much as you can, I think I could make more than like two or three hundred dollars. Keep that
[3734.55s -> 3740.39s]  in mind. Keep that in mind. Keep that in mind. I want one of these. I'm gonna get one of those.
[3740.47s -> 3746.60s]  Keep that in mind. What else is over here? Is this like the actual birthday party?
[3747.40s -> 3760.52s]  Are these the adults? What's? I don't understand this. Islandville Times. Carnival coming to town.
[3760.52s -> 3776.25s]  It is coming to town. You're right. Pinata? What a spoiled little shit. It's not even time to do this
[3776.25s -> 3783.93s]  and I'm just gonna break it. This is an hour or two from now. That gets hung over there. But I'm
[3783.93s -> 3789.85s]  gonna break it now. All right. I'm good. Let's go. I got my money. I'm going back to the duck machine.
[3789.85s -> 3823.13s]  Whatever the hell this thing is. Move. I'm ready. Here we go. First try. I'm sorry. I have to do it.
[3823.13s -> 3831.75s]  Each one of these has to be completed somehow. This is the best one to do. That's it. That's
[3831.75s -> 3850.98s]  the one. It is. Oh my god. You know what's actually kind of funny? I think I have sat there
[3851.86s -> 3860.82s]  at an arcade doing this machine cursing at this thing. Doing the same. At least it's for free.
[3869.51s -> 3872.47s]  You know there's like peep. There's like the families and kids around. I want to hear them.
[3872.47s -> 3877.06s]  So I just like put my hand up to my mouth and pretend I'm sneezing while coughing.
[3877.94s -> 3882.10s]  So every time I miss you know you have to be playing it like fucking 60 times.
[3883.32s -> 3896.87s]  You just go like and like you move your head forward like you sneezed every time.
[3897.99s -> 3899.67s]  It's easy. People think you're sneezing or coughing.
[3905.61s -> 3911.46s]  It would look so obvious.
[3913.40s -> 3923.14s]  Yeah I know. If somebody sat there for that long. Is there a policy in arcades? Does anybody know?
[3924.98s -> 3930.58s]  If there's somebody getting anybody work in an arcade. If there's of if somebody getting overly
[3930.58s -> 3935.70s]  frustrated. Is there a protocol where it's like okay like we should probably what do we do?
[3943.69s -> 3951.34s]  As long as you don't puke you're fine. All right I'm only I this can't be the whole stream.
[3951.34s -> 3966.90s]  So I'm gonna only try this like 30 to 40 more times. I got plenty of money. It's all right.
[3975.00s -> 3990.44s]  God damn it. This is not gonna be the whole stream. Try to fill the building with tickets.
[3993.78s -> 4010.23s]  Just he says don't pick up any tickets. Oh god. They're not taking anything. It's fine. I have
[4010.23s -> 4012.87s]  to accept defeat. I'll accept defeat when I go to zero in my bank account.
[4030.89s -> 4034.20s]  I just realized how unhealthy of a thing that was to say.
[4035.08s -> 4037.96s]  No no guys. I'll stop when I when I go to zero in my bank account.
[4038.92s -> 4061.42s]  What? That's not what you should be saying. That's not what you should ever say. Somebody just said
[4061.42s -> 4066.62s]  I'm never gonna hit that green light. I can come back to it. I'll come back to it later.
[4067.26s -> 4071.02s]  After I do this like another 10 more times. This is the one right here. Come on. Ready? One
[4071.02s -> 4090.57s]  two three. It's the one. Fuck. Not hard enough. I'm doing it way too soft.
[4091.29s -> 4105.35s]  Is this the whole? It's not going to be the whole stream. I can't even leave.
[4105.99s -> 4128.28s]  I can't leave. It won't let me leave. I'm stuck. All right. I'm fine. What's this one? Mega drop.
[4129.53s -> 4132.79s]  Oh I remember this one. This one's cool. Tickets. They'll be fine.
[4139.11s -> 4148.74s]  How many balls do I get? Just one? Yeah you the mega jackpot's almost impossible to get here.
[4149.62s -> 4152.82s]  Say I know that it's impossible.
[4155.54s -> 4169.50s]  1448. Get in there. What's that? What happened? Add bonus ball. I did it. I could do more.
[4172.15s -> 4178.79s]  Hit drop bonus. Hit drop bonus balls for rapid fire bonus. Oh you gotta get it in. That thing
[4178.79s -> 4188.25s]  has a ring around it though so it's impossible. What was that? Mystery bonus?
[4188.97s -> 4200.38s]  That's not bad. That's 212 tickets. How come they're not coming out? Let's go straight in.
[4208.26s -> 4213.13s]  250 tickets. There we go. Do you want me to do it again? I'll do it one more time.
[4216.44s -> 4228.14s]  Almost in there. 40 tickets. I used to time the ball falling straight into the highest prize
[4228.14s -> 4236.36s]  one. It takes time but I perfected it as a kid. Yeah you can just time it just to go straight in.
[4237.16s -> 4242.55s]  Give me the mystery bonus. What is this? Like roulette wheel bullshit? This is just roulette
[4242.55s -> 4260.15s]  wheel for kids. Get in there. Give me the 50. You're still checking to make sure the tickets are on
[4263.45s -> 4273.19s]  kind of. I want to make sure that they... I want to fill the whole house. The day even busters here
[4273.19s -> 4278.39s]  you put an out of order sign on this machine because it was too easy to get constant jackpots
[4281.24s -> 4285.32s]  out of order. I thought they want people to win. One more time.
[4293.02s -> 4297.96s]  Ah it was right there. Get in there. Get in the mystery bonus.
[4304.33s -> 4317.51s]  I can't wait to play skeeball. Oh it was right there. I want to just try to get that once.
[4317.51s -> 4320.95s]  I'm gonna try timing. We have a new noise to make.
[4324.31s -> 4329.91s]  Oh I did it. I actually did it. I actually did it. I did it.
[4333.83s -> 4344.26s]  Oh there's gonna be more bonuses. What? I thought that was like super bonus. Drop bonus. I thought
[4344.26s -> 4356.82s]  I just... I thought it doesn't drop. I thought it drops like a bunch of them. Like rapid bonus drop.
[4364.70s -> 4369.50s]  I needed to mash the button. I was clicking and didn't do anything.
[4376.26s -> 4379.46s]  Imagine getting the bonus first try and not hitting the button to get the bonus.
[4381.85s -> 4395.03s]  I thought I was. It just disappeared.
[4407.21s -> 4407.93s]  I did it again.
[4411.18s -> 4416.90s]  Wait what? What happened to that one? No I gotta hear the Yoshi sound one more time.
[4416.90s -> 4422.39s]  There it is. I love it. I love the Yoshi sound. I have to hear it like a few more times.
[4425.51s -> 4437.22s]  Got it. My brother could kick your ass this game. Tell him bring it on.
[4438.02s -> 4443.83s]  Well that was like three or four consistent bonus balls in a row.
[4445.11s -> 4448.41s]  Damn it. All right I'm gonna try to get the jackpot. I'm gonna try to go for it.
[4449.05s -> 4461.86s]  I'm gonna try to time it. Like right here. Ready? Oh that was close.
[4462.58s -> 4466.63s]  It's that like stupid toilet bowl lid that fucks you up.
[4473.21s -> 4485.40s]  One more time. Get in there. Rapid bonus. Mega bonus. Oh no.
[4488.71s -> 4492.98s]  The tickets are not gone. The tickets are still there. I can see them.
[4493.70s -> 4498.28s]  Oh shit. Get in there anyways.
[4508.01s -> 4512.63s]  Here we go. Ready?
[4514.87s -> 4534.33s]  And try it last time. Get in. The tickets didn't despawn. I have an eagle eye on them.
[4535.05s -> 4537.43s]  Mega jackpot. Get in there.
[4537.43s -> 4544.39s]  Oh.
[4558.34s -> 4565.43s]  And that's the way he went. What? That's not what it looks like.
[4566.07s -> 4577.62s]  Are you serious? Why is this like such a tiny pile? Just making sure.
[4577.62s -> 4606.02s]  Come on. Come on. Let's go. This is the one. Come on.
[4609.53s -> 4636.52s]  I got my muscle memories wrong. What happens if it goes in the toilet?
[4637.32s -> 4646.74s]  There's no skill to this. Well how? What do you mean no skill to this? How have I not hit it?
[4648.17s -> 4664.97s]  It's forward momentum and spring-loaded action. Don't make me get one of these for the carnival
[4664.97s -> 4680.90s]  stream and have you guys prove me wrong. Don't make me rent one of these. Come on. Get it.
[4681.94s -> 4720.18s]  Can I do it? Oh my god. Damn it. All right. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out.
[4720.18s -> 4723.86s]  After this last one here. This is the last one and then I'm out until I come back.
[4735.11s -> 4741.02s]  I have to do this at least once. My brain is wired so fucked up. You know what I'm saying?
[4741.26s -> 4746.14s]  I have such a fucked up wiring of my brain. I have to do this even if the stream is off.
[4747.02s -> 4751.10s]  This stream could not be online and I will sit here until I do it.
[4755.18s -> 4770.68s]  And now I'm just not even close. Kim will come in here and ask me to open another jar.
[4772.07s -> 4780.20s]  My hand will be too weak from clicking this mouse. This is it. This is the one right here.
[4780.76s -> 4808.14s]  Oh damn it. What a loser is what he just said. What a loser. Oh my god.
[4820.71s -> 4822.71s]  I have to win to prove that person wrong.
[4841.54s -> 4844.58s]  You can do this with cheering you want. Thanks guys. I need more cheering.
[4846.06s -> 4849.50s]  This is getting really high. I'm gonna be able to make a ticket snowman.
[4850.14s -> 4872.04s]  This is gonna hurt somebody. That's a hazard. I'm only gonna try to get this one spot here.
[4872.04s -> 4880.58s]  Ready? I'm gonna have to count here. Ready? This is this spot right here. One. Two. Nope.
[4880.58s -> 4895.02s]  It's less than two seconds. Yes, I'd like to play again. One. It's a little more than one second.
[4895.02s -> 4897.74s]  Less than two seconds. More than what? That doesn't make any mathematical sense.
[4898.38s -> 4901.74s]  It's more than one second. Less than two seconds. So it's like 1.72.
[4901.74s -> 4928.20s]  It's like 1.82. It's fucking hard.
[4958.70s -> 4965.38s]  I'm turning into an ape. That was so fucking loud. I'm so sorry.
[4967.06s -> 4974.28s]  I'm so sorry everybody. That was fucking loud. That was rigged. It is. I did it.
[4975.64s -> 4988.98s]  My god. It wanted to do it too. All right. I'm gonna do it. I got it. It's gonna happen.
[4990.38s -> 5019.02s]  Here it is. This is literally a podcast at this point. He hasn't moved from this spot.
[5021.06s -> 5026.50s]  This would be the shittiest podcast I've ever listened to. Hey everybody. Welcome to the podcast
[5026.50s -> 5031.78s]  here. Yeah, hold on. Hey everybody. Welcome back to the podcast. Today's episode is...
[5041.32s -> 5055.40s]  Almost. Now we're gonna take our mid-podcast break. Please listen to our sponsor. Why would
[5055.40s -> 5069.66s]  you download this podcast? Imagine that for like fucking two hours? That's what's happening now.
[5070.70s -> 5076.95s]  You don't have to imagine because that's what's happening right now. That's what has happened.
[5076.95s -> 5080.71s]  It has been an hour and 25 minutes. You don't need to imagine or pretend.
[5085.48s -> 5089.00s]  Okay. This is the one right here. They're not giving it to me anymore because my
[5089.00s -> 5101.34s]  cursor's on it. The game developer put in a feature. All right. I'm serious. This is like
[5101.34s -> 5111.70s]  the last three or four times I'm gonna try this. Okay. I gotta get like three or four more attempts
[5111.70s -> 5124.07s]  with the green being there. Which one is it? This one? It's this one right here. Oh shit.
[5127.32s -> 5138.82s]  Fucking psycho. Go cash your tickets in. That's it. I know it. I know that's the one.
[5139.38s -> 5187.19s]  Okay. Here it is. One, two. Get out of the way. Come on. Whoa. What just happened?
[5195.91s -> 5207.40s]  God damn it. Don't let the chicken win. Okay. At this point people have their phones out
[5207.96s -> 5213.43s]  and this is like watch this guy at the arcade being insane. There's like people,
[5213.43s -> 5219.59s]  there's like 10 cell phones behind me. Oh my god. I'm gonna freak out.
[5227.37s -> 5234.54s]  One, two. Oh my god. What do I do? How do I get out of this? I have to like rip the,
[5234.54s -> 5237.26s]  I have to rip the ethernet cable out of my computer I think. I have to rip the power out.
[5247.61s -> 5251.05s]  All right. One more try there and that's it. And then I'm moving on to the next machine.
[5254.44s -> 5268.97s]  That has to be right there though. Please do this forever. No. Don't enable me.
[5269.61s -> 5283.62s]  Get out of here. This is, this is my ticket. All right. Oh fuck. One more. No. That's it.
[5283.62s -> 5286.42s]  That's it. I gotta get out of here. I have to leave. That's it. I can't do it.
[5289.40s -> 5297.50s]  I can't do it. I'm out. I gotta leave. I can't do it. Just rip it out.
[5306.82s -> 5324.36s]  I can't, I can't do it. But what's, there's no reason to try. I can't do it. I can't move.
[5334.49s -> 5342.76s]  You know, this looks like somebody, it looks like you've
[5343.72s -> 5362.30s]  squashed this and all of its guts came out. What's this one? I love this one. No. In order. In
[5362.30s -> 5370.09s]  order. In order. I'll be back motherfucker. I'll be back and I'm gonna, I'll take care of that.
[5370.09s -> 5398.95s]  Don't worry. All right. Let's play skeeball. I did it. I did it. I can leave. I can leave. I did it.
[5401.21s -> 5416.78s]  What's this? Okay. I went. I went. Okay. I'm out. That's enough. I did it. I knew I had it in me. I
[5416.78s -> 5420.06s]  could feel it. I could feel it. I just had, I knew it. I, you know something you just know.
[5423.37s -> 5428.81s]  I just knew it. I felt like, like a, like a guardian angel landed on my back and was like,
[5428.81s -> 5456.46s]  Jeremy, you can do that. I was like, okay. Oops. Ooh. This is fun. Cole, RG, thanks for the five
[5456.46s -> 5468.50s]  community subs, Cole. Thank you for those. I gotta get a hundred. Hundreds. It's so satisfying to do
[5468.50s -> 5504.23s]  swish it. Oh, come on. What a dick. Swish it. I gotta get a swish. Oh, one swish and then I'm done.
[5510.65s -> 5516.55s]  Oh, use the tickets. I will. I will. I'm just making sure that nobody else can touch that machine.
[5517.58s -> 5525.16s]  I have it reserved. A hundred. Oh, they're not going to despawn. I got a, I got a good eye on
[5525.16s -> 5536.52s]  him. Oh, shower please. Okay. Let's get him. You ready for this? You ready to pick up our
[5536.52s -> 5575.38s]  baklava? This is going to be so satisfying. What? What do you mean stop? Stop. Stop. Stop. Why?
[5577.22s -> 5606.71s]  What are you talking about? Okay. That's it. Just want to see if I had, if lightning can strike twice.
[5606.71s -> 5616.06s]  I'm done. All right. Let's go count them. How many tickets do I have? How many tickets do I have?
[5616.14s -> 5633.21s]  10,000. What do I got? 80, 80, uh, 8,800? All right. What's next? Ski ball. I want to get the,
[5634.01s -> 5637.69s]  I want to get better ski ball. Let's do the one on the right.
[5640.54s -> 5648.78s]  8,600, 800, 8,641. How many points do I need to get on ski ball before I move on?
[5649.34s -> 5655.03s]  I'll determine that in a minute. I gotta find the hundred and just keep it in the same place.
[5656.15s -> 5660.15s]  That's the strategy. Just don't move the fucking mouse. So I'm going to, let's see.
[5660.31s -> 5667.29s]  Let's see right here. Maybe like right there. And then we're going to go halfway up. No, not even
[5667.29s -> 5690.31s]  close. No, a little bit less than that. I need to get 800 points to leave ski ball. Uh, that's never
[5690.31s -> 5703.83s]  going to happen. Why do I keep moving? I'm not moving. It's going, it's doing that automatically.
[5703.83s -> 5709.42s]  It picks up the ball. Yeah. Just climb up on the machine and put it in the hundred
[5711.43s -> 5716.63s]  and then get yelled at and you get told, don't do that again. Oh, okay. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
[5721.11s -> 5729.16s]  Yeah. Just walk over there, reach up and drop all the balls in there and then get yelled at
[5731.80s -> 5736.60s]  and have your mother get called. Oh my God. I have to get a hundred points. What a pathetic score.
[5736.60s -> 5744.97s]  90. I can't, come on. I can't even get my IQ in this game. Let's go. I gotta get at least my IQ.
[5754.70s -> 5768.66s]  Come on. You can't get zero points. See that you, you are on top. You got that one. You're on top
[5768.66s -> 5785.54s]  of that. Why is it so hard to get the hundred? There it is. All right. Right there. I know where
[5785.54s -> 5797.00s]  it is. Just don't move from this spot. Ready? Shit. All right. I'm, I'm, I'm almost at my IQ.
[5798.30s -> 5811.24s]  So I passed it by just a little bit. All right. I got the hundred. That's all I care about.
[5812.52s -> 5822.01s]  Is there one more? All right. 180. No, I'm done. All right. Let's go and get these up. 180 tickets.
[5824.30s -> 5828.70s]  All right. So that leaves us with the ones in the middle and then there's, I think there's another
[5828.70s -> 5840.86s]  floor. Yeah. I know there's like another floor, but I remember this one. You have to speed drop
[5840.86s -> 5845.42s]  this. All right. Let's try it. You got to try to get all 50, right? Press the button to drop
[5845.42s -> 5850.81s]  balls into the buckets. You got to try to go like, yeah, you have to like spam it and get it in.
[5851.37s -> 5866.22s]  So like this, you got to try to get five in each one. If I remember to get them all.
[5867.02s -> 5884.36s]  I can do all 50. I can do all 50 guys. Just relax. You got to go one, two, three, four, five,
[5884.36s -> 5911.22s]  one, two, three, four, five. Ready? What? What? What? Why? Why? Why? It delayed. It was lagged.
[5911.22s -> 5946.15s]  What the fuck was that? Pull back that button. Listen to the clicks. He wins another one.
[5946.71s -> 5955.54s]  Another 500 tickets. Another one. Thanks guys. You want to see me do it again?
[5956.50s -> 5960.18s]  Yeah. Do it again. Do it again. Yeah. All right. I guess I'll do it again.
[5965.72s -> 5987.75s]  Nobody was watching. That one didn't count. Okay. Here we go. I can do this twice. Ready?
[6009.35s -> 6014.55s]  Oh man. That's an easy. I'll do it. I got it rigged. I will get. Thank you. I'll do it again.
[6014.55s -> 6017.75s]  I'm going to get like 5,000 tickets one more time. I got to get three, three times.
[6017.75s -> 6049.99s]  It's a drum. An easy 1500 tickets. Shit. It's okay. Sorry. Cash out. Cash out. No, no. I'm fine.
[6050.71s -> 6065.00s]  All right. Let me get it one more time. Let me try it one more time. Ready? No, I didn't mean to
[6065.00s -> 6069.48s]  click. I clicked accidentally. My fucking death adder. All right. I'm done. I'm going to go to
[6069.48s -> 6077.37s]  the next one. I won it twice. That's all that matters. This person's even wearing AirPods.
[6077.37s -> 6100.70s]  She can't even hear me. Right? I'm fine. All right. Here we go. This one will. I had to do
[6100.70s -> 6109.62s]  this one last down here because this one's going to fuck me up so bad. I have beaten this in real
[6109.62s -> 6143.46s]  life before. I've gotten the last prize before. I have done it. You remember this one? Minor prize.
[6143.46s -> 6158.82s]  Go for the major. Oh, fuck. It doesn't, it doesn't every, it does that every time. It doesn't,
[6158.82s -> 6164.18s]  it does it on purpose. It does it on purpose. It does it on purpose. It pushes it forward.
[6164.82s -> 6208.52s]  I'm rushing. I thought I had it first try. Come on. No, major. Give it to me. You fucking piece
[6208.52s -> 6237.74s]  of shit. Major. And I fucking just, my hands are greased. I had to dump my hand in oil before I
[6237.74s -> 6280.04s]  played this one. All right. Fuck. I have to win this. It's, I'm locked in now. No minor prizes
[6280.04s -> 6291.86s]  for me. I got to get the last one. Sorry. Fucked it up. I'm like too, that's too much pressure.
[6298.31s -> 6320.01s]  I wish I had the button in front of me. You know, the big like, what? What? That was correct.
[6320.73s -> 6330.46s]  That was correct. That was correct. And something you need to know about this game
[6330.46s -> 6336.70s]  in real life. I don't know how it is tuned in this one, but you can actually inside of this machine,
[6337.58s -> 6343.90s]  you can tweak to make sure that even if it's done correctly, the person doesn't win at all.
[6344.06s -> 6347.98s]  It just skips. So I don't, it could, this one could also be rigged. I don't know.
[6351.83s -> 6404.34s]  I thought I had it that first try too. Holy shit. Relax. Okay. I did it. Oh, I got headphones.
[6414.62s -> 6419.90s]  No, what that was, that was, that was all, that was a wound of a bunch of tension that just had
[6419.90s -> 6426.15s]  to come up. That was just a bunch of like neuroticism that had to release from my body.
[6426.87s -> 6442.18s]  Oh, nice. Wait, what? Can I put them on? That was a feel good ink laugh.
[6451.91s -> 6459.66s]  10,000 tickets. I win. I beat all the games. I did them all. I beat this one. I got the 500
[6459.66s -> 6463.18s]  tickets on this one. I got the 500, a hundred tickets on this one. I beat the chicken.
[6463.74s -> 6476.28s]  I got the jackpot on this. I got a hundred. I didn't beat this one. What are you gonna get?
[6476.28s -> 6482.82s]  You gonna get hockey? You gonna spell hockey? I did beat the chicken. I got the green light.
[6483.54s -> 6500.55s]  I said where's the 500? I got 500. Let me try to spell hockey.
[6501.27s -> 6511.91s]  I blew it. That was 500 right there though. All right. How many chances do I get?
[6513.51s -> 6520.70s]  I never got the mega jackpot on the draw point. Yeah, but I got the regular. I got the jackpot.
[6523.26s -> 6535.50s]  This is gonna be hard to do. Shit. How many times you get to do it once? Three times? Four times?
[6536.46s -> 6561.86s]  Hello. Hi, guys. Well, that was weird. Strangely enough, the internet just cut to zero.
[6564.10s -> 6567.30s]  I don't know what happened. I don't know why. It was pretty perfect the whole time.
[6570.39s -> 6574.23s]  So that's really fucking irritating. But hey, we're back. Welcome everybody. How you doing?
[6578.79s -> 6589.90s]  Let's see if it happens again. Probably not though. Who knows? So sorry about that. Let's
[6589.90s -> 6600.54s]  try this again. Hey, we're back. How are you? Uh, Pinman. Thank you Pinman for the 10 community
[6600.54s -> 6607.02s]  subs. Appreciate it. 10 community subs from Pinman. I'm gonna make the- I'm gonna re- I'm
[6607.02s -> 6610.38s]  just gonna tweet again just because people probably thought that might have been it.
[6612.52s -> 6624.71s]  But it's not. Can I- can you retweet your own tweet? What happens if you do that? Is that- is
[6624.71s -> 6630.81s]  that- can you do that? No, no, no, no. That's stupid. I'm not gonna do that. I'm gonna redo
[6630.81s -> 6651.11s]  the tweet. Did anybody see my tweet? I'm gonna redo it again. Retweeting your own tweet and then
[6651.11s -> 6664.63s]  quoting that tweet in another retweet. I'll just do this. Damn it. I was- we were writing- we were
[6664.63s -> 6668.95s]  in the groove too. That's- that's so unfortunate. All right. Don't let it bother you. Don't let it
[6668.95s -> 6680.17s]  just- didn't happen. Didn't happen. Didn't even happen. Let's go. It bothered me. It bothered me
[6680.17s -> 6696.55s]  too. Let me spell hockey. But thank you for your patience everybody. It's 10. I don't think it's
[6696.55s -> 6713.64s]  even possible to do this. You gotta get them lined up together. H- okay. H-K-E. It carries over.
[6714.44s -> 6723.40s]  Oh shit. Okay. So I need the O, the C, and the Y. Okay, let's try to get the O, the C, and the Y.
[6725.06s -> 6730.12s]  Bingo. Oh, that was- that- that was just right off the grid. That's perfect.
[6733.10s -> 6739.88s]  C. All right, just need the O. What's the jackpot? That- that would be the jackpot, wouldn't it?
[6739.88s -> 6752.02s]  Where's the O? There it is. Damn it. I blew it. It's all right. Come on. Wrap around again.
[6758.63s -> 6764.63s]  2,000 tickets! Are you fucking kidding me? That's like the biggest jackpot so far.
[6765.43s -> 6776.39s]  I almost just did an evil laugh. Let's get these counted. I did it all. I- I- okay, now we have to
[6776.39s -> 6785.85s]  move on to the next set of games. I got the fidget spinner. I got the- the hockey jackpot.
[6786.65s -> 6790.65s]  I didn't get the jackpot on this, but this thing's stupid, so I refuse. I don't know
[6790.65s -> 6797.64s]  what the jackpot is on this, but I don't know. I refuse. I got the cards here. Let's count these.
[6797.64s -> 6805.67s]  I'm not gonna cash in yet. You only got one of the three fidget spinners.
[6807.19s -> 6815.08s]  I'm not gonna get all three fidget spinners. All right. This is my birthday party. Should I
[6815.16s -> 6827.58s]  spend them? Ticket redemption kiosk. I have 13,000. Do I get to hold on to these? All right,
[6827.58s -> 6836.49s]  let's see what I get. All right. Glow stick is 250 tickets. I'll take a glow stick.
[6838.07s -> 6845.05s]  Okay, cool. What else do you got? A stuffed coin? Dumb. Nobody wants that. Paddle ball? No.
[6845.05s -> 6853.38s]  It looks- that'll go into the trash. Basketball? No. Fuzzy dice? No. 2,500 foam hand. Stuff ticket?
[6853.38s -> 6863.86s]  No. Stuff donut? No. That's ta- how many do I have? 13,000? 25,000. What's the most expensive
[6863.86s -> 6878.31s]  thing here? A mirror? A slingshot? Does it work? Can I actually use it? Piggy bank. Headphones. I
[6878.31s -> 6886.79s]  already got the headphones out of that thing, so I don't need these. Salt rock lamp? Yep.
[6888.09s -> 6899.32s]  Those things are so cool. 100,000 tickets is for the boom box. 50,000 for teddy bear. All right.
[6901.90s -> 6908.82s]  He just lifts his hands up over the counter and lets it go. All right. I'm gonna save my tickets.
[6908.82s -> 6913.85s]  I got what I want. I got a glow stick and I got a salt lamp. How much is the PlayStation 4?
[6913.85s -> 6923.64s]  It's not on here, unfortunately. Can't save indoors. How do I get my card out of there? All
[6923.64s -> 6939.00s]  right. I'm giving my stuff. Okay. Let's go to the next part. I've completed all these ones.
[6939.56s -> 6948.55s]  So how do I go- how do I get to the next area? With games. I know there's more games. Go to my
[6948.55s -> 6970.31s]  golf cart. Jerry's the pier. The beach. Is it the pier? Oh man. There's like rides too? Are you
[6970.31s -> 6978.70s]  serious? How much does it cost? Your wallet balance. So I can do eight pack ride pass.
[6978.70s -> 6985.91s]  Let's get the mega pass. Wait. I can only afford this. Okay. There's the eight pack for the ride.
[6985.91s -> 6999.05s]  Okay. Eight ride pass. Should I bring more money in here? I'm getting- I gotta get more money from
[6999.05s -> 7010.70s]  the uncle. Hold on. Yeah. Back to- hold on. Back to Larry's. I need to go back in my money shower.
[7017.11s -> 7027.19s]  Go rob your uncle. No. My uncle just stashes one dollar bills in here for me to take whenever I
[7027.19s -> 7036.14s]  want. And give me some of this too. Just do the money shower for 10 minutes. I'll get 200 bucks.
[7036.14s -> 7048.33s]  We'll do this until I get 200 and then we can just- we can go do the rest of it. Just stay in one
[7048.33s -> 7052.33s]  spot. Is one of the tricks for this thing? People freak out and they try to grab all over the place.
[7052.41s -> 7058.65s]  No. Just keep your hand here and just grab. Grab, grab, grab, grab, grab, grab, grab, grab, grab, grab,
[7058.65s -> 7060.89s]  you'll get as many. You don't have to freak out. People freak out in here.
[7065.74s -> 7072.44s]  And make sure you put them in your pockets or in your underwear. You know, people are like,
[7072.44s -> 7076.36s]  oh my hands are so full. I don't have any more room in my hands. Just stuff them down your pants.
[7076.36s -> 7100.02s]  Like stuff into your underwear. Keep grabbing. Okay. That was weird. Because it's hard to do
[7100.02s -> 7104.26s]  your pant- your pockets. You might be panicking and it's hard to get your hand in your pockets if
[7104.26s -> 7111.06s]  you're stuffing bills in there, but your underwear is just a gigantic elastic pocket.
[7114.36s -> 7119.32s]  I would just be grab, stuff, grab, stuff, grab, stuff, grab, stuff, grab, stuff. I would take them
[7119.32s -> 7128.39s]  all. Once you have 10 bills in your pocket, it's going to be hard to put anything else in there.
[7128.95s -> 7149.77s]  One more time. Tuck your shirt in your pants and then your shirt isn't bagged. Yeah. And then just
[7149.77s -> 7154.97s]  start feeding it down. First put like rubber bands around the bottom of your pant legs
[7156.01s -> 7171.21s]  and then just become an inflated guy. All right. I got 200 bucks. 199. That's fine.
[7172.41s -> 7188.04s]  I'll take it. Get out. That was like very clear. Get out of my way. All right. Let's go to,
[7188.84s -> 7205.64s]  is there a, uh, how did I get to that before? I have to be outside. I was just thinking about
[7205.64s -> 7211.24s]  doing the chicken game again and I freaked out and stopped. All right. Um, let's go to,
[7212.44s -> 7233.03s]  let's go to Barry's. Let me sell my stuff. You know, I had to try, right? Barry's. All right.
[7236.57s -> 7243.98s]  Please use the other door. No, I'm using this one. Pawn and swap. Barry, we buy anything.
[7244.54s -> 7255.48s]  What's my hand? Oh, my card. Cheesy poops. I thought they were poops. Okay. My uncle gives
[7255.48s -> 7272.86s]  me these for free. Why would I buy them? That's enough of that. Uh, what's this? Okay. So, uh,
[7272.86s -> 7285.66s]  let's go here. We have to put in the headphones. How much are the headphones worth?
[7287.43s -> 7306.07s]  I thought that said 4,500. All right. What about the salt rock thing? I don't think I want this.
[7314.20s -> 7323.72s]  Yeah. I don't want like the zip. Yeah. I did say it was cool, but that's whatever.
[7325.62s -> 7338.54s]  Keeping the glow stick. All right. Let's go to the pier. I'm ready. I got my pass. Let me get,
[7338.54s -> 7346.26s]  I need to get me get another pass. The super pass. I have like 40 rides. I have like 30 something
[7346.26s -> 7359.98s]  rides. All right. Let's dart over here. 20 coins for $5. That's one of these machines. I hate these
[7359.98s -> 7379.21s]  things. Ah, hold on. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it. Shit. I hate these ones because
[7379.21s -> 7396.81s]  it's travel time. What is it? What do those chips do? Can I hit the machine? I probably can,
[7396.81s -> 7400.25s]  but it's going to get me in trouble. I gotta wait. I gotta time it. I'm going to do this way.
[7400.89s -> 7406.18s]  No. Damn it. Hit it. I'm not going to hit the machine. That's again, that's illegal.
[7407.42s -> 7416.82s]  That's against the law. No, I'm not going to do something against the law.
[7417.46s -> 7423.91s]  We're going to win this the right way. This isn't even working.
[7427.85s -> 7437.05s]  This doesn't even do anything. I'm trying to get it like, what am I doing? Why am I trying to do it
[7437.05s -> 7443.34s]  like that? I don't know why I'm trying to get it to land on top of that. It makes no sense.
[7447.05s -> 7455.94s]  Pick a prize. Hammer. Four prize credits. I don't have any prize credits. All right. Let's see this
[7455.94s -> 7463.75s]  again. I can do this. What's over there? Look at how empty that one is. All right. We're going to go
[7463.75s -> 7482.25s]  now. Ooh, dropping more prize tokens. Why is this not moving? Are these just glued on here
[7482.25s -> 7497.94s]  under the coins dropping down a hole? Wait, why? Why can I, why would I be allowed to do this?
[7498.82s -> 7517.80s]  This seems like cheating. Tokens have no real value. These machines are not regulated in any
[7517.80s -> 7526.10s]  way and are most likely a scam. Do it again. I'm just going to put all the coins up at the same
[7526.10s -> 7534.68s]  time and try to just knock something up. He loses even when he's cheating. Watch this. I'm going to
[7535.40s -> 7543.72s]  strategically place these coins in the corner here and there's going to be a big push. I wish
[7543.72s -> 7552.07s]  they would not stack on top of each other. Why are they doing this? Why are you doing this? Stop
[7552.07s -> 7561.66s]  doing that. Why? That doesn't make any, all right. I've got magnets. They magnetized. I get it now.
[7568.17s -> 7584.33s]  Do it. What? That doesn't make any sense. I don't believe that for a second.
[7585.21s -> 7595.46s]  Those prize coins don't do anything. They don't move. I'm going to do this one more time.
[7607.43s -> 7618.44s]  You can't even get them. Oh, I can get the three down here. All right. These ones are actually
[7618.44s -> 7623.24s]  not glued. The right side is the one to do. Look at how stuffed that is too.
[7635.61s -> 7651.58s]  This is depressing. This is not real money. This is not even real. Yeah, we've got floating coins
[7651.58s -> 7664.54s]  over here. It's bullshit. All right. I'm going to at least get the hammer. Let's see what I do
[7664.54s -> 7673.78s]  here. Ready? Watch this. That was not, that was unfair. All right. Push forward. Watch this. This
[7673.78s -> 7689.13s]  three is going to come out here. That felt really good. Only four at a time. That's all you need to
[7689.13s -> 7707.80s]  do. All right. I got three game points. How many do I need? Five. I think that's all I need. I
[7707.80s -> 7721.13s]  might as well get the lighter. How many more points? How many more points? They're right.
[7721.13s -> 7741.00s]  They're all right here. I got to try. All right. All right. How many do I have? It's one for the
[7741.00s -> 7752.12s]  crayon. I'm going to get the, yeah, give me this. I don't know. What? Where'd it go? Where is it?
[7753.00s -> 7782.97s]  Where's my prize? Where's the prize? Did I just get scammed? Oh, did you just like throw it over
[7782.97s -> 7788.44s]  here? I didn't know it went over here. All right. I did it. I won. This one's out of order, out of
[7788.44s -> 7801.35s]  order. No, we beat that one. I got the fish. That's all I care about. What's this? Island time customer
[7801.35s -> 7810.63s]  service out of order. Oh well. I'm doing, I'm doing the thing that your dog does when they go in the
[7810.63s -> 7816.42s]  backyard. Just run around the perimeter like three times and then come back in the house.
[7818.62s -> 7830.68s]  I need to check the perimeter. Beer tent. I got like a flashlight. Am I allowed in here?
[7831.78s -> 7840.76s]  Oh, come on. Am I not 21? Coins on the ground. Some kid will be happy that he finds that.
[7841.56s -> 7851.94s]  Bumper cars. Ferris wheel. Hold on. All right. Let's do the Ferris wheel.
[7854.70s -> 7875.03s]  Holy, why am I running so fast? I made it. Okay. So is this a stranger? Hi. I'm just gonna say the
[7875.03s -> 7886.58s]  Ferris wheel is probably the worst ride that's ever been invented. You just sit. You don't do
[7886.58s -> 7894.31s]  anything else. I mean, yeah, that's cool. Nice. But you can just look out the window for an airplane.
[7894.87s -> 7901.50s]  And like, y'all look, I can see the ocean and other stuff there. This shit's like 40 bucks to
[7901.50s -> 7921.75s]  do this. Can I stand up? It just skips it. God damn it. Well, that was fucking like seven dollars. Oh,
[7921.75s -> 7929.90s]  well. Just get on the airplane that everybody has. Yeah, just get on your airplane.
[7930.62s -> 7936.86s]  Okay. So what's over here? Look at all these. There's a bunch of other games over there. All
[7936.86s -> 7944.98s]  right. Hold on. I'm getting overwhelmed. I don't think it's supposed to be on. Somebody get their
[7944.98s -> 7964.01s]  kid. Shut it down. We've been a kid. How do I? I want to do this. No, sorry. I'm just looking for
[7964.01s -> 7988.70s]  my kid. Jerry. Jerry. Oh, here we go. I would like to play, please. All right. Bumper cars.
[8000.14s -> 8016.95s]  Peel out. This is so dumb. Is there anything else I can do while I'm in here? Or no, I'm gonna try
[8016.95s -> 8025.40s]  to get only go from corner to corner. I'm gonna try to pick up some speed and just ram into
[8025.40s -> 8030.52s]  somebody. This is what I used to do. You guys want to have a secret tip for how to do bumper cars
[8030.52s -> 8036.44s]  right? Drive around in a circle because everyone gets stuck in the middle. Build up enough momentum
[8037.80s -> 8043.24s]  going around the circle and then bang, you just smash into somebody. Otherwise you just do this.
[8044.12s -> 8056.54s]  For five straight minutes. Everybody sticks in the middle. That's the butt. This rat right here.
[8063.10s -> 8082.18s]  Well, it's not, there's usually not that many people. I'm very all right. All right. Well,
[8082.18s -> 8100.01s]  bye. Lemonade. Oh, they have the tower of terror. Okay. Hold on. Which way do I go? Over here. Wait,
[8100.01s -> 8110.86s]  wait, wait. Now wait for me. Wait for me. Come on. I'm going to get off for free. This is the
[8110.86s -> 8116.62s]  quickest way to get like your head, like your neck broken. Wait for me. Wait for me.
[8117.58s -> 8139.75s]  All right. I'll get on it. Oh, it's a security guard. How am I going to get on this?
[8140.47s -> 8156.23s]  Oh, I think it resets it. Yeah. All right. Here we go. Uh, I do not like riding these.
[8156.79s -> 8165.78s]  I don't want to be on this because people puke on these all the time. And if Guy and Sombrero
[8165.78s -> 8172.26s]  ahead of you here pukes, this is going to hit you. This is going to be, you're going to,
[8172.34s -> 8177.86s]  it's going to cover your whole body. It's going to spray you across your entire body, head to toe.
[8179.91s -> 8194.57s]  Don't ride these. If you're going to puke on one of these, lean down and like try to puke this way,
[8194.57s -> 8204.42s]  but it might get just caught up and swing up in the wind and hit somebody. I hate this. I'm
[8204.42s -> 8213.06s]  getting off. Or just lift your shirt up. Guys, if you're going to throw up on a ride, don't be the
[8213.06s -> 8217.38s]  dick. Like you're throwing up, right? So try to do just, you're going to, your day is going to be
[8217.38s -> 8223.30s]  fucked up after that. Anyways, grab your shirt, lift it up, tilt it. So it makes a big cup and
[8223.30s -> 8235.14s]  just puke into your shirt down. Don't ruin somebody else's vacation. Just, yeah, just
[8236.58s -> 8242.12s]  underwear. All right. Sucks. Who wants to ride that? Let's keep going.
[8249.16s -> 8254.33s]  I'll do this one. Isn't this now the guardians of the galaxy ride now?
[8260.06s -> 8265.82s]  Imagine seeing somebody go, Oh no. They're like pulling their pants and just puking down.
[8270.47s -> 8274.89s]  That would be the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life. I would never get over it.
[8277.54s -> 8282.87s]  Ever. That would be the only thing I could think of for the rest of my life.
[8295.91s -> 8299.59s]  Okay. I'm thinking right now as if I've seen this. I've never seen this, but I'm
[8299.59s -> 8311.32s]  laughing because of it. This didn't happen. People puke on this thing all the time too.
[8312.04s -> 8330.34s]  That's why the vents are here. Can I stand on it? I can't like stand in it.
[8335.75s -> 8341.99s]  I'm not sure I can get a free ride here guys. Maybe I can. Let's see what happens.
[8343.67s -> 8359.43s]  Nope. All right. Another game coming up. Wait, here's another ride that you should never ride
[8359.99s -> 8364.30s]  because all this ride does is make you feel like you're peeing into your stomach.
[8364.94s -> 8385.64s]  It doesn't do anything else. No, no, I'm done. I can't. I hate this thing. You could put me on
[8385.64s -> 8393.83s]  a roller coaster that goes 5,000 miles per hour. I'll ride it every time. Sorry. I don't want to
[8393.83s -> 8397.83s]  ride the thing that specifically just makes you feel like shit. That's all these rides do.
[8399.35s -> 8406.06s]  There's no other purpose for these rides. They don't do anything. The only thing they're here
[8406.06s -> 8414.78s]  for is to cause you stomach discomfort. And for one thing, I, I tried to do the, but I couldn't
[8414.78s -> 8428.30s]  get them out. I couldn't get it out. I tried. So he's just standing there. You never should ride
[8428.30s -> 8431.50s]  these rides. And I'll tell you another thing. And the thing just hits him right in the face.
[8433.18s -> 8445.48s]  That's not funny. All right. What's that? There's a couple of games, right? Here we go. One race
[8445.48s -> 8449.72s]  is fun. Ooh, this is the, you spray the, I can do this really well. You're going to spray the
[8449.80s -> 8482.01s]  circle. Is that me up there? Why am I going so slow? All right. Let me tell you something.
[8482.01s -> 8487.46s]  Number four clearly did not hit the circle one time. Look at number four. Watch number four.
[8488.95s -> 8526.63s]  No, do it again. Let's go. I'm going to put my DPI down for this. Way down. Did I do it? Three?
[8526.63s -> 8542.42s]  What? All right. I'm going to put DPI down even more. Try this one more time.
[8542.42s -> 8585.19s]  No, it's too, my sensitivity is too high. How do I turn my sensitivity down with my mouse? Hello?
[8585.19s -> 8601.50s]  Oh my God. My, the DPI is so high. I cannot even use my mouse on my desktop. Did I break it?
[8605.30s -> 8631.10s]  Uh, I think I broke it. Yeah. I can't get out of here. Shit. No, I was, I have to win. No,
[8631.10s -> 8638.02s]  it's not. I'm doing the DPI. I think I just broke it. I mean, I can alt tab, but I'm going to have
[8638.58s -> 8660.36s]  to, let's go back in. I can beat that. I just need to turn my mouse sensitivity way down because
[8660.36s -> 8664.28s]  there's no mouse settings in the game. So let me turn them. Let me turn my mouse like pointer speed
[8665.32s -> 8674.04s]  down to like tiny, tiny, tiny amount. Pointer speed. Let's go like down here. That looks good.
[8674.68s -> 8678.97s]  I think I just crashed my whole computer by changing my mouse speed.
[8683.96s -> 8706.58s]  How the fuck does that make any sense? All right. We're good. All right. Here we go. Survival. I
[8706.58s -> 8731.70s]  can't do survival. It's not ready yet. There's fireworks in this game. All right. Let me get
[8731.70s -> 8743.08s]  some money. I don't care about any of that. Just give me money. Why is it so loud now?
[8743.80s -> 8758.58s]  So much louder than it was. Why can I not change the audio now?
[8764.74s -> 8770.02s]  Load game. Um, well here's the thing. I never saved it because you can't save inside.
[8774.71s -> 8798.68s]  All right. I got plenty of money. Let's go. Uh, one more time. Generate. I don't think I even
[8798.68s -> 8822.66s]  need to click. All right. Back to the carnival. Just do the crane game. No, no, no. Everyone's
[8822.66s -> 8827.54s]  saying that. Oh no, I didn't save. That's all right. Because I can do the bucket machine
[8827.54s -> 8834.33s]  or the hockey machine and get 2,500 tickets guaranteed every time. Everything's gonna be
[8834.33s -> 8856.60s]  fine. All right. Back to the carnival. Hello, sir. I'd like to buy, uh, eight ride passes
[8856.60s -> 8860.68s]  because the rides, I don't want to ride rides. I want to play games. And there's like 10 that
[8860.68s -> 8872.74s]  I haven't played yet. So let's keep going. Back to the water spray. Is lemonade a game or no? Is
[8872.74s -> 8882.41s]  it just a lemonade? I think it's just a lemonade. 450. Are you out of your mind? What did he say?
[8883.05s -> 8906.57s]  Where's my lemonade? Oh, now the volume is too low. Why? I think I broke something.
[8906.81s -> 8916.23s]  Um, when they're strong. All right. I weirdly drank that out of the cup. All right. Here we go.
[8917.26s -> 8951.22s]  DPI is better. Time to win. I have to win every single game or riot. The DPI that I didn't do
[8951.22s -> 8957.96s]  anything. I changed. I lowered the mouse DPI and lowered the mouse pointer speed. It didn't
[8957.96s -> 9001.06s]  matter. I have to do it without it. Let's go. Oh, to relax. I got it. I'm going to have to do this
[9001.06s -> 9007.56s]  with my feet in a minute. I think I'm going to do this with my feet. No, I'm not kidding. Start
[9007.56s -> 9058.60s]  over here. It's still, I can't. I can. I'm trying to find, where's like the sweets back? Why is it
[9058.60s -> 9093.75s]  freezing up? See what I'm saying? Like why does it keep freezing? Take three as a spot. I don't think
[9093.75s -> 9102.54s]  I can do, there's nobody at three. I was trying to, I have to be at five. I'm going to try to aim
[9102.54s -> 9133.08s]  a little bit, a little bit more down. I did it. I did it. I just did it. I win. Holy shit. All
[9133.08s -> 9145.72s]  right. What do I want? Ice cream cone. I want the ice cream cone. Two of those. All right. That one's
[9145.72s -> 9153.10s]  done. Congratulations. You win. I wish I could eat those in real life. All right. What's this?
[9156.01s -> 9164.12s]  Lucky duck. What's it called? Lucky duck. I don't have to jump to see this. One duck for two bucks.
[9168.06s -> 9181.16s]  I don't understand. What does that mean? Oh, you just pick the ducks and one of them is correct.
[9181.80s -> 9201.64s]  It's this stupid thing. You can't win this one. There's no way to win this.
[9203.24s -> 9227.00s]  What are you? Three? Plus three credits I think is winning. Get pushing. What's pushing? The snake or
[9227.00s -> 9236.97s]  the cat thing? All right. Hold on. I will. I will. I'll do it. I'll do it. I need to get a plus three.
[9237.61s -> 9256.25s]  I did it. I win. Gotta win every single fucking game. Is it a bowling ball? That thing is huge.
[9256.89s -> 9270.30s]  Wow. That thing. That's the snake. That's the snake from the children's book. All right. Well,
[9270.30s -> 9282.81s]  here's this one. This one's really hard. Five balls for five dollars. You got it. Yellow is three.
[9282.81s -> 9312.78s]  Blue is two. How do I throw it harder than that? This is pathetic. I can get it in the middle. I
[9312.78s -> 9318.52s]  can get it in the middle. Let's do it again. Right in the middle. I can get it right in the lily pad
[9318.52s -> 9335.18s]  in the middle. Come on. What do you mean? No, you can't. Shit. I don't know why my brain is so
[9335.18s -> 9347.32s]  stupid. I thought that just said literally pad toss. I did it. Yes, I did it. Why was that only two?
[9357.08s -> 9369.00s]  That was on a blue. I wonder what's the middle word then? There we go. Right there. Done. Ah,
[9375.51s -> 9384.63s]  shit. This is just the chicken game again. I have to get it in one particular. It's that easy. It's
[9384.63s -> 9388.71s]  so easy when you do that. You hit the jackpot. I'm going to hit it twice. Three, two, one, two
[9388.71s -> 9405.16s]  times. Did I even get any credits? What did that even do? Give me the goldfish and the hot dog.
[9405.16s -> 9417.51s]  I win. Did I get a secret? Am I being watched? Does this guy think I'm cheating or something
[9420.52s -> 9430.18s]  of my counting cards? Shoot. Oh, that. I am excited for the one over there. I don't care
[9430.18s -> 9438.47s]  about anything else. Hundred shots for five dollars. Let's go. I'm really good at this.
[9471.48s -> 9475.64s]  It's it's I win. I did it. It's over. I won the whole thing. Give me, give me whatever
[9475.64s -> 9501.43s]  the credits you're going to give me. Perfect. Oh, I everyone wants you to get the banana. I'll get
[9501.43s -> 9529.59s]  the banana. Perfect again. That's how you get it done. Louder, louder. You turn your volume down.
[9547.56s -> 9556.39s]  Sorry, sorry. I still fine. Banana. No! Okay, I thought it was about to fall backwards.
[9557.03s -> 9568.07s]  No, that was easier than I thought it was going to be. Balloon time. Darts, right? This is the dark
[9568.07s -> 9574.66s]  game. Oh, there's that ball roller. Oh, there's so many games. I can't wait. All right, let's go.
[9582.07s -> 9610.89s]  What's worth what? Okay, I got three darts. Shit. What? Is it painted on there? One credit. Let's
[9610.89s -> 9636.49s]  get a skill shot over here. Are they all worth the same? Are they? We're getting all kinds of ideas
[9636.49s -> 9651.10s]  for the carnival stream. You guys might get to do this. I think they all just worth one. I'm going
[9651.10s -> 9657.96s]  to try to get like one of the cool ones up there. That was worth a shot. Throw it at the guy. I'll
[9657.96s -> 9677.62s]  take the hammer. Throw it straight up so it lands on your head. I can't. I can't. That went through
[9677.62s -> 9694.04s]  that guy. I won. All right, over here. This is the roll the ball one. Carnival stream. Oh, for those
[9694.04s -> 9701.94s]  of you that don't know, at some point over the next couple of months, I'm working with a robotics
[9701.94s -> 9708.76s]  team and a certain producer that is going to help make a twitch robot controlled carnival.
[9712.34s -> 9725.51s]  That's like the next big stream. It should be a lot of fun. So I need to roll this and I'm not
[9725.51s -> 9729.67s]  trying to... I don't want to give that many details because I don't want to obviously talk about it
[9729.67s -> 9733.35s]  and say, hey, this is what's going to happen. How cool is this? We're going to be here for like an
[9733.35s -> 9752.73s]  hour. You just got to get it over the hump, right? Does it have to touch the thing in the back?
[9756.36s -> 9759.64s]  You can go ahead and admit that there's going to be a dunk tank with you dressed as a clown.
[9759.64s -> 9765.72s]  Yeah, but I've already said that. You guys already know that. I've been talking about that for
[9765.72s -> 9786.04s]  months. Get in there. Shit. How much is this? Do we have to pay? No. You do not. Touch it? No.
[9786.04s -> 9789.32s]  I never understood this game. Do you just have to get it to sit in that little well?
[9793.62s -> 9802.25s]  Or does it have to touch the button? He will play this game all the time and I just like don't get
[9802.25s -> 9814.30s]  it. Is it going to be a random audience member chosen? No. Well, there's still a lot of ideas on
[9814.30s -> 9818.14s]  the table, but the theory is that it's going to be like Twitch control, like Twitch plays.
[9820.02s -> 9824.02s]  So you guys are all going to be fighting with each other to try to shoot a pitching machine
[9824.02s -> 9832.63s]  controlled robot at the dunk tank. That's as hard as I can throw it. That was as hard as I could and
[9832.63s -> 9861.78s]  it didn't do it. And we're not, no more, we're not going to talk about it anymore. Just know that
[9861.78s -> 9884.30s]  it's high. Does it matter how like where I'm looking? Just shoot it with the gun. I still
[9884.30s -> 9903.30s]  don't understand. I don't understand how, where are the rules? I don't, I did it. I just did it.
[9903.30s -> 9918.70s]  I did it. I win. I did it. They clap for me. Now I demand it. This is my stream. When I say clap
[9918.70s -> 9928.17s]  for me, God damn it. That means you do like that. I don't think you can hit the button. I'm holding
[9928.17s -> 9935.22s]  it as long as I possibly can. No, you don't hit the button. You just get one credit. I'm going to
[9935.22s -> 9958.97s]  hammer. That's a golden hammer. What else we got? Oh, basketball shot. My turn. You got to hit all
[9958.97s -> 9972.46s]  three of them. I'm actually pretty good at this when I do this in, in real life. I just jump so
[9972.46s -> 9992.89s]  high and throw it really high in the air. Okay, hold on. I can do this. Where is he aiming this?
[9998.26s -> 10010.28s]  I feel like he's not aiming in the right spot. Well, that was pathetic. If you do that at the
[10010.28s -> 10018.10s]  carnival, oh, you better not be around a bunch of friends. You can't even make it halfway up. Come
[10018.10s -> 10044.87s]  on. You can do that. I got it. Okay. I got to get three in a row though. What the hell was that?
[10044.87s -> 10067.56s]  No, I got to do more. I got to do three in a row. At least two in a row. Shit. Come on. I can do
[10067.56s -> 10081.19s]  three in a row. That's just two. I can do three. Let's do three in a row. I promise it'll happen.
[10081.43s -> 10121.59s]  I found the spot. Yeah, I kind of did. There's one. There's two. Oh, this game's fun. This is,
[10121.59s -> 10149.99s]  this is just a fun little time waster. Fuck. Just reset it. You promised. What did I promise?
[10152.36s -> 10167.22s]  Wait, what did I promise? What are you talking about? What did I promise? You promised. You
[10167.22s -> 10173.08s]  promised three shots in a row. What do you think I'm trying to do? What do you think of what, what,
[10173.80s -> 10178.74s]  I am promising that I'm going to get three in a row. So that means I'm going to do it until I
[10178.74s -> 10196.04s]  get three in a row. Stop failing. Oh my God. You guys are getting in my head.
[10207.43s -> 10234.04s]  That's not how you do it, son. I don't roll it. No, you don't. Oh, I had to roll. One, two. All
[10234.04s -> 10269.56s]  right. All right, kids. Okay, kids. I did it. Three. Imagine going to one of these things and paying
[10269.56s -> 10274.94s]  the money just to have fun and do this. But you're trying to get three in a row and your other two
[10274.94s -> 10281.46s]  balls, you just lift up, put them on the ground and say, no, I want to do it again. What a fucking
[10281.46s -> 10293.02s]  weirdo. That's not going to go in. Oh my God. I'm fucking going to lose my mind. Just, I'm just
[10293.02s -> 10298.22s]  going to grab this in one hand and crow hop and just push shot put throw it as hard as I can.
[10298.94s -> 10321.24s]  Did that just go behind me? How does that make any sense? Why is this not doing this now? How
[10321.24s -> 10341.40s]  did I, what am I wearing? What am I doing wrong? All right, I got this exact spot that I need.
[10342.04s -> 10371.10s]  I know exactly where to go. It's right on the wood. Oh my fucking God. Why is it doing this to me?
[10380.31s -> 10388.15s]  I know I promised. Just relax. You promised. How many, it's like the teacher going with
[10388.15s -> 10411.58s]  chaperoning the students and the whole bus is sitting behind me. You promised. I'm trying.
[10411.58s -> 10414.54s]  All right. All right. This is the last one. It's the last. I don't care if I don't do it.
[10414.54s -> 10426.78s]  This is it. This is the one. This is the last one. I don't think it's going to happen right
[10426.78s -> 10438.01s]  now. Let me go get a goddamn ice cream. All right, kids. All right, kids. I'm going to do it.
[10448.36s -> 10454.49s]  Oh, just get on the bus. Get on the bus. Everybody get on the bus. Go, go, go on the bus. But you're
[10454.49s -> 10488.57s]  not on the bus now. I can't, I can't do it. I can't do it. I don't think I can. I don't think I can
[10488.57s -> 10512.33s]  do it. I really don't think I can do it. It's like lagging and bouncing. I can't do it. I'm just like
[10512.33s -> 10542.38s]  the angry guy. He just like fucking whips it as hard as he can into the net. Oh my fucking god.
[10542.38s -> 10547.40s]  Get me out of here. Just stop. Just get out. Just leave. Turn around. Just get on the bus.
[10547.40s -> 10553.05s]  I'm out. I'm getting on the bus. I don't want any prizes. I don't deserve a prize.
[10553.77s -> 10583.34s]  I want to give me a donut. New text message. Oh, I'm out of money. I'm out of money. Was it a pizza?
[10583.66s -> 10600.57s]  Okay, that was fucking, that was not, that was rude. I need more money. I need, uh,
[10600.57s -> 10604.17s]  is there any other games or is that the one that beat me? Is that the last one that's going to
[10604.17s -> 10638.39s]  beat me? Do I still have my ride pass? No, let's go in here. I'm just going to make myself and
[10638.39s -> 10648.10s]  everybody watching sick, I think. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Is it still here?
[10649.35s -> 10659.90s]  Are we live? Oh god. Get off. I don't want to be on this ride. Not when the internet's having
[10659.90s -> 10683.91s]  a problem. What the fuck is happening? This doesn't make any sense. This is just strange.
[10683.91s -> 10688.95s]  What are they building over here? The UFO. Oh, is it? I know the UFO they're talking about.
[10688.95s -> 10693.88s]  When you get in, you sit, you stand and your back goes against the wall and it spins you around
[10693.88s -> 10705.98s]  really fast. Can I go in? No, fuck this thing. I hate this. I think I've only read, uh, read one
[10705.98s -> 10722.36s]  of these. Yeah. Red road. I think I've only rode one of these once and I said never again.
[10722.36s -> 10729.80s]  I only read one of these. All right. Well, that's cool. Let's go back to Larry's so I can get my
[10729.80s -> 10739.58s]  money back. Oh, I want to like play these again. All right. I'm going to just run to the machine
[10739.58s -> 10756.44s]  and I have to beat the, I can't be beaten by the basketball. I just can't. What's the, yeah. Why
[10756.44s -> 10761.70s]  do you need a flashlight in this game? There's really no reason for it. Wow. I'm just going to
[10761.70s -> 10777.37s]  turn it off. I'm going to get one of these. I'm going to get one of these for that stream.
[10777.93s -> 10787.35s]  I'm going to prove to you guys that I can do it. Okay. Now here we go. It's coming back.
[10788.39s -> 10791.99s]  UFO arcade arcade has different games. It's not a ride. Oh, that's cool.
[10796.55s -> 10840.47s]  I can't hear it. Look, I'm a fan. Hey, hey, give me that back. Yeah. Hey, that thing's worth money.
[10840.47s -> 10854.68s]  Isn't it? That's, that's worth a lot of money. Oh God. It's right here. All right. I got money.
[10854.68s -> 10869.93s]  Let's beat the basketball game. I'm going to beat the basketball. Warehouse factory. So these
[10869.93s -> 10888.68s]  aren't done, right? Are we still live? Yeah. I don't know what the fuck's happening. I have no idea.
[10889.62s -> 10900.97s]  I wish I had an idea. So is there any more games to play? Is this the last one? Go to the gas
[10900.97s -> 10916.28s]  station? Okay. Come on. All three of these. Come on. Just do it. I did not do the fireworks either.
[10920.15s -> 10922.71s]  Fuck. Oh my God. Let me, let me try a different spot.
[10939.98s -> 10943.02s]  Make sure the ball's level. Yeah. It's just bouncing around. I need to get a swish.
[10945.08s -> 10950.54s]  That's probably the best spot to do it. Right here off the backboard, but it's just so,
[10956.74s -> 10967.50s]  ah, you promised. I know. I know. I promise. No, it's, I gotta have to do it that way.
[10967.50s -> 10975.40s]  This is bird. What? Yeah. What's with the bird thing? What are you guys saying? Bird, bird,
[10975.48s -> 10983.16s]  something bird, Larry bird. What are you guys saying here? That's not it. I fucked it up.
[10985.30s -> 10991.56s]  The bird game. I don't know. Somebody said like, oh yeah, this is bird, something bird.
[10999.67s -> 11021.30s]  Did I just make that up in my head? No way. My God. What was the reference people were making
[11021.30s -> 11025.72s]  when I was sitting here playing this? Somebody was, people were saying something. I gotta go
[11025.72s -> 11043.58s]  higher. No, higher. I swear to God, somebody, people were saying like, like blue or something.
[11044.78s -> 11061.70s]  There it is. These people in the bot are going to be like, oh, that's what he's talking about.
[11064.65s -> 11079.74s]  All right. Here we go. This is it. I can finally be done. Oh, every time on the third one. Why?
[11080.86s -> 11092.78s]  That was in the same exact spot. That was in the same spot. It really was. What did I do wrong?
[11094.73s -> 11106.46s]  Now I can't do anything. Damn it. It's not worth it. This is, it is worth it. I'm going to leave
[11106.46s -> 11129.43s]  again and come back after this try. I'm going to go play the fireworks or something. Whatever.
[11129.43s -> 11136.52s]  I'm going to go to the gas station, gas station. Let's go. I don't want to play again. No, I'm done.
[11136.52s -> 11150.18s]  Thank you. No, I don't want anything. Bye. All right. Let's go to, uh, where is it?
[11150.18s -> 11178.10s]  Pier, Larry's, Barry's? Was there a gas station? Jerry's? Sorry. Jerry's. Okay. There we go.
[11178.10s -> 11199.62s]  Jerry's gas station. Soft drinks. Can you play with these? Oh no. 25 dollars. Get the 25 dollars.
[11206.26s -> 11220.09s]  No. Match three to win. Reveal three boats and get the special prize.
[11221.13s -> 11237.29s]  Not a winner. Two, none. I gotta go get some more money. Match three sevens.
[11260.54s -> 11276.14s]  No, no, no. Not Barry's. Larry's. Going and spending uncle's money on scratch tickets only.
[11284.28s -> 11290.33s]  Well, for a game that's just about like 15 to 20 little carnival and arcade game,
[11291.05s -> 11314.09s]  there seems to be a lot more you can do. One guy is making this game. Yeah. Okay. Back to the gas
[11314.09s -> 11324.70s]  station. You can do a paper route. Is that in the game yet though? I feel like is that something
[11324.70s -> 11335.21s]  that I can actually do? It is. Okay. Well, hold on. Let me buy a couple of 25 dollar scratch tickets
[11335.21s -> 11365.77s]  and then we'll go. Win. I get three, three fires. Oh my. What a piece of shit. Come on. Really?
[11369.18s -> 11382.74s]  In a row. Three boats. That's a fish. I need two more fishes. Ooh. A trunk full.
[11385.86s -> 11393.22s]  Okay. It's two fifties. Give me another fifty. No more ones. Oh my god. This is a 25 dollar ticket.
[11416.34s -> 11457.56s]  All right. Let me do the paper route. How many of these do I need to deliver? Is it a plane? No.
[11460.12s -> 11472.07s]  How do I do this? So I have to deliver a paper here. Where's my golf card? I have the papers.
[11472.23s -> 11483.98s]  No. Not again. Not again. Don't do it again. You've made us suffer enough cocks with this nonsense.
[11483.98s -> 11502.30s]  Come on. All right. So I need to go over here. All right. Which one of these does it have to go in?
[11502.30s -> 11505.58s]  There's a lot of mailboxes here. Which one is the one that who has the subscription?
[11539.48s -> 11559.59s]  All right. I'm getting stuck on the cart. Give this to me. That's two dollars. In the time that
[11559.59s -> 11581.48s]  it just took me to do that, I could have been in a great Uncle Phil's money machine for 10 seconds.
[11581.48s -> 11603.77s]  Oh, I'd love that. I'm going to get a hundred bucks and then from there I'm going to do
[11603.77s -> 11607.45s]  five scratch tickets and four scratch tickets. I have to win a scratch ticket once. We have to
[11607.45s -> 11625.67s]  win every game once. I'm going to go back and do basketball again too. It's impossible to win.
[11626.39s -> 11639.21s]  What do you mean? Hawn the newspapers. Are they worth more than two dollars?
[11640.17s -> 11648.76s]  Why am I stuck? What are they? What are they? Oh, they're little. It's like string. You shoot like
[11648.76s -> 11678.97s]  little stringies. It's a rubber band. Okay. One more. Just pawn stuff to that. Just hold on.
[11679.61s -> 11689.53s]  Let me get my bearings and see where we're at. You know what I'm saying? I might have 150. That's
[11689.53s -> 11707.14s]  enough. Okay. This is my last 150 I'm putting into scratch tickets. Pawn one of the robots. I don't
[11707.30s -> 11718.84s]  think I can do that. Remember when I won that one? Oh, I felt so good. All right. Let's pawn all
[11718.84s -> 11740.15s]  this shit. You're right. Let's get rid of it. Oh, no. I've been live for 17 minutes. No. It's
[11740.15s -> 11744.71s]  actually been like three and a half hours. It's just the stream has made a new vaude like three
[11744.71s -> 11765.53s]  or four times. They can't come in. All right. Let's pawn some stuff. Make some money. This is
[11765.61s -> 11777.26s]  all my possessions. Hey Barry, I'm here with all my stuff. I have three newspapers and a bunch of
[11777.26s -> 11788.92s]  pool toys. 50 cents. It's just a giant coin. All right. Can I put more things in there at one time?
[11793.26s -> 11796.30s]  Let's see what happens. Can I do more than one? Yeah, you can do more than one.
[11797.82s -> 11823.98s]  14 bucks. Really? What else is this stuff worth? You're selling memories.
[11824.54s -> 11834.25s]  But the memory of me being addicted to a basketball game for like fucking an hour?
[11834.25s -> 11854.60s]  I don't think that's a very good memory. The fish was 30 bucks. My last two possessions.
[11856.57s -> 11868.22s]  The snake from the... I'm keeping you. How much does it work? 80 bucks. Holy shit. Get rid of it.
[11869.18s -> 11907.96s]  All right. 330 bucks. 340. All right. Here we go. I'm the only person that's coming over.
[11909.32s -> 11959.96s]  What did I have? I had 340, right? That wasn't done. It's all right. Four. All right. I'm doing
[11959.96s -> 11982.92s]  all right. That's... I just need one more fish. 12 dollars and 50 cents. I lost 50% of what I put in.
[11982.92s -> 12023.16s]  Car. Car. Ugh. You're playing minesweeper. Let chat do one. Okay. Chat can do the last one.
[12027.24s -> 12036.62s]  All right. This is pretty good. Need one more fish. Holy shit. That is a boat right there.
[12036.62s -> 12047.02s]  Need two more of those boats. This... All right. There's two. One, two, three, four, five, six,
[12047.02s -> 12055.53s]  seven, eight, nine. There are nine slots left. Two out of nine has to be a boat. Okay. Whatever.
[12055.53s -> 12087.03s]  I made my money back. You piece of shit. Come on. Got the money back. Three in a row. They're just
[12087.03s -> 12109.82s]  sitting in a row. Unbelievable. I need one more fish. No more twos. Ugh. I just need to win the boat
[12111.16s -> 12133.06s]  or a fish. All right. Somebody just... Somebody just wrote he's so bad. You can't be bad at picking
[12133.14s -> 12164.09s]  random spaces. What does that even mean? Just give me the car. Ugh. Stop being so bad. I'm making a
[12164.09s -> 12180.74s]  mess. All right. You guys can do the last ticket. You want to show me how it's done? Let's see. Show
[12180.74s -> 12189.38s]  me how it's done. Good. Let's see how good you guys are at picking shit. Huh? Let's see how everybody
[12189.38s -> 12201.02s]  is at picking things. It's going to be impossible to do this. I can't zoom in far enough. Do your
[12201.02s -> 12213.77s]  best. Let's see how well you do. Nobody talking shit about how you're talking shit. All right. Go
[12213.77s -> 12229.00s]  ahead. Actually, it is going to work pretty well. All right. Right there in the middle. I see 25%
[12229.00s -> 12240.38s]  of you clicking that one. That's the one we're going to do. 26%. Okay. Let's do it. Here it is.
[12240.38s -> 12263.19s]  There's a three. 1250. Go again. What is the next scratch going to be? You guys are playing
[12263.19s -> 12274.01s]  connect to four. That's how spread out this is. The one that's 13%.
[12276.55s -> 12280.71s]  The one down the bottom right. That's the only has to be that one. Yeah. The one that one. That's
[12280.71s -> 12315.19s]  14%. The car. It's the $50 car. Not a bad choice. Not bad at all. Okay. Keep going. By the way,
[12315.19s -> 12325.42s]  all clicks on the left side on O, S, and H are not counted. There is no consensus here yet. Okay.
[12325.42s -> 12335.51s]  There is 16% want to do that one over on the left. That's the one it's going to be right here.
[12340.55s -> 12357.37s]  Sorry. You were not. I was incorrect. Ready? Three, two, one. It's okay, chat. We can do it.
[12369.69s -> 12378.30s]  Up in the corner. I'm doing it. Here we go. 30%. It's a four. Okay. You have two, three,
[12378.30s -> 12393.53s]  four in the tank. So you're pretty spread out so far. Not bad. Where to next? You guys almost
[12393.53s -> 12411.10s]  have a straight. Yeah. That's correct. Hmm. Pretty split between down the bottom and no,
[12411.10s -> 12420.22s]  it looks like it's right there in the middle. Bottom middle. Somebody said at least we don't
[12420.22s -> 12431.46s]  get ones. Oh, there's a hundred dollar fish ever so closer. You guys have almost every single one.
[12431.46s -> 12437.72s]  That's a good thing to do though, because then you can deduction statistically. You are making
[12437.72s -> 12449.18s]  it easier for you. I'm going to zero again. No, I'm not. All right. We're good. We've proven that
[12449.18s -> 12456.82s]  you're bad at RNG. That's not really 73% of people want to go that way, right? That many people want
[12456.82s -> 12468.47s]  to click the top left one. That's unheard of. We should do chat plays view in battleship.
[12471.40s -> 12475.00s]  I mean, we could do that, but that would require me to have another person in here because I could
[12475.00s -> 12490.15s]  just see you guys have every single one. All right. This is actually really good. Well, you
[12490.15s -> 12504.39s]  don't have the boat yet. The last one that you're missing is the boat. I'm going to go down and
[12504.39s -> 12512.12s]  scratch the void if removed. Is there any explanation as to why the void if removed
[12512.12s -> 12530.57s]  is scratchable? Why would they put that there? All right, let's go. Oh, fuck. Oh God. You guys
[12530.57s -> 12538.28s]  are in a good... This is the best spot you could possibly be in. One more fish and you have the
[12538.28s -> 12556.10s]  second best prize you can get on this ticket. Go for it. You guys are going for it. Could it be
[12556.10s -> 12561.43s]  the coveted three in a row? It might be. I don't know. That's where you want to go. That's where
[12561.43s -> 12587.85s]  we're going to go. Nope. Are you guys going to leave here with a measly $25? Better than me. I
[12587.85s -> 12600.86s]  got 25 like three times. All right. Is this your final answer? 47%. Good luck, guys. You would
[12600.86s -> 12624.76s]  never... Yup. Congratulations. My turn. I do one, you do one. Okay. My turn. I do one more.
[12628.44s -> 12640.63s]  All right. Your turn. There's so much trash everywhere. I can't even pick it up.
[12641.11s -> 12652.17s]  All right. Your turn. Your turn. What's wrong with this one? What's the prize under there? Can you
[12652.17s -> 12670.10s]  see? This one's broken. Oh, it was a three. It was a three. It actually was a three. Oh no. Keep it
[12670.10s -> 12693.05s]  going. It was the money symbol, but the other way. Kind of. Right here. You got it. First fish of the
[12693.05s -> 12724.10s]  evening. Again. I would laugh so hard if you guys got three votes. Ready? You sure? Okay. Uh oh.
[12724.10s -> 12738.42s]  Sorry, guys. That was not the right spot to be in. If we get three votes, we get to keep the
[12738.42s -> 12758.92s]  winnings. That's not written anywhere. Okay. Here we go. It's a two. Two means none. If we get three
[12758.92s -> 12775.64s]  votes, then you have to play salmon max. No. What? I'm going to do that anyways. All right. Let's...
[12775.72s -> 12786.41s]  unanimous. Oh, shit. All right. There's the vote.
[12799.64s -> 12809.34s]  Go ahead. We need a better incentive. What's something that you want me to do so bad that I
[12809.34s -> 12814.76s]  won't do? I mean, I've played two seasons of salmon max. It's not like I wouldn't do that.
[12815.32s -> 12827.43s]  What incentive? Doki doki? No. That... by the way, there's no consensus here. I gotta wait
[12827.43s -> 12839.61s]  like another few minutes. Eat another McChicken. All right. We've got a majority.
[12840.33s -> 12871.21s]  We're not a majority. We have just a winner. 1250. That leaves me one more chance to do it myself.
[12871.21s -> 12943.98s]  Fuck. No, no, no, no. I don't want to come back here. I want to go... That's it? That's not even
[12943.98s -> 12966.14s]  enough. That's not even enough for me to do it again. No, no, no. And I gotta... Oh, the F...
[12966.14s -> 12975.19s]  Right. It's zoomed in. All right, guys. I'm going to... Here's the plan. Just relax for a minute.
[12975.19s -> 12989.42s]  I am going to go get like $500. Just hang out. I'm just going to go get... I'm going to go just
[12989.42s -> 13027.74s]  take a withdrawal of $500. Fuck. I need to get... I'll do it again. That was a weak poll.
[13046.54s -> 13061.29s]  Biggly's close. Be the voice. Oh, well, look at what you did there. Oh, gonna try to get
[13061.29s -> 13074.49s]  a big fish here now. Oh, that poll was a big poll now. Oh, you got yourself 10 tickets now.
[13076.66s -> 13090.68s]  100 tickets. 100 tickets. Oh, 100 tickets. No, it's not 100 tickets.
[13094.62s -> 13105.14s]  You got yourself a thousand tickets. Come on. I'm gonna do as hard as I can and then leave.
[13109.42s -> 13146.74s]  No, wrong way. Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong. Wait. Is this fireworks? What do you got there?
[13146.74s -> 13177.53s]  Where'd you get this? Where did you get this? Where'd you get that? Is he getting in trouble?
[13177.53s -> 13185.91s]  All right. I'm out of money. I'm out of money. I don't know what to do. The beach? Hold on. I
[13185.91s -> 13204.50s]  need to go back into dads because I need to make some money. Let's get some money. You guys all
[13204.50s -> 13219.67s]  stand and then wait. Okay, just hang out for a little bit. Just chill. What's the best way
[13219.67s -> 13230.97s]  for me to get money? I gotta be like in the right spot. Right here? Right here looks good.
[13232.09s -> 13240.82s]  The banana guy's worth 80 bucks. Where can I get the banana guy? You're right. From the
[13241.30s -> 13255.50s]  okay, I'm just gonna win the I got to go win a few times off that stage. This guy, this is the
[13255.50s -> 13258.70s]  person in the suit though. I can't like bring that. All right. I got the idea. Hold on.
[13260.46s -> 13276.20s]  I know what I'm gonna do. Let's go to the pier and I'm gonna go win the banana like 10 times.
[13276.92s -> 13280.54s]  I'm gonna have like three grand. We're gonna buy like 40 scratch tickets.
[13281.54s -> 13374.55s]  Where is he? It's the darts, right? That's the easiest thing in the game. I win. I didn't get
[13374.55s -> 13396.57s]  anything. What? I know it's loud. Just turn it down a little bit. That's three. I gotta do it.
[13398.02s -> 13404.12s]  There's whack-a-mole. Where's whack? Where? Where? Where's whack-a-mole? I didn't see whack-a-mole.
[13410.42s -> 13414.42s]  Oh, let me help you here. I'm gonna turn this down. This is probably killing you.
[13432.58s -> 13458.98s]  Oh my god. Did I mute it? I turned way down. You should be able to still hear it. Dang, sir. Why?
[13460.42s -> 13484.41s]  What are you talking about? I'm... What's a movie I could watch at any time? Um, Gremlins 2. That's
[13484.41s -> 13495.10s]  it, right? Okay. One more. One more. And that's 80 bucks. Because I'm in it. You guys know that
[13495.10s -> 13502.92s]  friends of mine, way before any of you guys made that reference, uh, friends of mine told me that
[13502.92s -> 13519.38s]  same thing. That I'm just the guy with the tie. It looks... It's... We're identical twins. Okay.
[13519.38s -> 13526.54s]  You had a friend before Twitch? Yeah, I did. Okay, so I got 80 dollars... 80 bucks there.
[13526.54s -> 13567.22s]  There's gotta be a better way. I can swish it, I think. Hold on. Pay for it again. How many
[13567.22s -> 13610.46s]  credits do I have? How... What's the mo... Okay, I can turn this back up. Uh, yeah, I didn't know
[13610.46s -> 13625.83s]  I had that many credits there. All right, so this is fine. So that's... How do I have to back a truck
[13625.83s -> 13639.16s]  back here? Oh, no. Not good. That's all my inventory space. It's... It'll be here when I come back.
[13639.16s -> 13647.03s]  Let me find where the swish is. I'm gonna say if I go, like, let's go to the top, like, up here.
[13650.17s -> 13659.59s]  Okay, hold on a minute. This actually might work. I gotta find the swish right between the A and the
[13659.59s -> 13682.81s]  B. Right under the A. Right, like, at the blue line. Nope. A little bit lower. Top of the backboard.
[13682.81s -> 13714.41s]  Close. Top of the red. That's it. That's it. It's a fucking exploit. That's two. No, dude, I need three.
[13714.41s -> 13721.03s]  I need three. I found it. I got it. That's the one right there. Right at the top of the red in the
[13721.03s -> 13730.14s]  backboard. It's a swish. And here we go. Get... Everyone get back off of the bus because this is
[13730.14s -> 13754.28s]  gonna be it. Swish. Again. Oh my god. I'm gonna get it. I'll do it. It's gonna happen. Why do I choke
[13754.28s -> 13791.99s]  on every third fall? Why? Just get it up there. I just started itching my armpits. Right there.
[13791.99s -> 13806.98s]  How does it... How does it change from the last time? How did it change from the last time?
[13815.46s -> 13820.10s]  Consistent power? I'm... I am. I'm holding it down the whole time. That's why I'm trying to find the
[13820.10s -> 13826.10s]  one spot where I can be in. It's probably something stupid like... Yeah, like somebody said the wind.
[13826.10s -> 13850.17s]  I wouldn't be surprised. I... Yeah, I know it sways in my hands. That's why I've been waiting for it
[13850.17s -> 13856.68s]  to get in the middle. It goes back and forth. That's why the line in the middle... I'm trying
[13856.68s -> 13862.68s]  to keep it just right in the middle. That's why every time I've waited till it was in the middle.
[13864.22s -> 13886.15s]  Like that. This variance... This is some kind of variance when you throw it. It's never gonna
[13886.23s -> 13896.04s]  happen. Yeah, you have to get lucky. No, I don't want to... I want to stop this. I can't even click
[13896.04s -> 13901.72s]  done. I can't... I can't get out. I'm stuck here now because I have no inventory space.
[13902.36s -> 13960.18s]  All right, get this shit out of the way. Free stuff, kids. Take it. It counts! It counts! It counts!
[13960.18s -> 13971.54s]  Counts! Counts! Counts! Counts! Counts! Oh, I keep... People are gonna say it didn't count.
[13971.54s -> 13976.18s]  It counts. It went in and went out. In real basketball, if it does that, it counts.
[13982.94s -> 13986.84s]  It counts. It counts. It counts. No, it counts. It counts. It's over. I win.
[13986.84s -> 13998.66s]  In real basketball, if it goes in and then goes out, it counts. Yeah, I win. I did it. I did it
[13998.66s -> 14012.58s]  three times in a row. All right. Okay, cool. Guys, thanks for watching the video. Weird how I did
[14012.58s -> 14043.64s]  that first try. All right, let's get the fuck out of here. Wait, can I scan these and take them out?
[14043.64s -> 14061.24s]  And then pull them out? No, I can't. I can't scan the machine. What are these worth? They're worth
[14061.32s -> 14069.00s]  $14 a piece. That's actually really good. How much are the cats worth?
[14069.72s -> 14112.81s]  Eleven. So why would I even get the cat? It's worth less. That's a lot of money. Is it given
[14112.81s -> 14148.58s]  to me in ones? All right, I got 228 bucks. All right, that's enough for good old scratch tickets.
[14148.58s -> 14189.85s]  Fucking mess out of the way. How am I gonna get? Like eight? Ten? Okay, I'm gonna do the first three
[14189.85s -> 14243.66s]  and then you guys can do one. All right, cool. Slow down. I got two cars. I got a boat. Come on,
[14243.98s -> 14265.66s]  look at how many spaces there are. Oh my god. I'm gonna do a technique. The whole
[14265.66s -> 14273.51s]  just the whole bottom row and then the whole top row. It's our turn. No, it's not. Not yet.
[14343.42s -> 14368.78s]  Why are they missing spaces? Got it. Four bucks. Yes, I am brute forcing scratch tickets. Yes,
[14368.78s -> 14397.21s]  I am. Okay, they're deleting spaces. I'm out. All right, here, your turn. Okay.
[14397.93s -> 14405.59s]  Yeah, you can do that. Yeah, let me do this one. Okay, you can do this one. You can do the,
[14405.59s -> 14426.36s]  yeah, here. You can do this one. Here you go. Wait, now you have to do with it. Okay,
[14426.36s -> 14432.26s]  we want the other one. We want the other one. We want. All right. Okay, all right.
[14432.98s -> 14455.83s]  I'll let you do that one here. All right, you can do this one. Okay, go ahead. I don't know
[14455.83s -> 14470.97s]  if I can even click this one. I'll try. Ooh, it's the trunk full $50. Nice work so far, guys.
[14470.97s -> 14490.04s]  Can you keep it up? Oh, you guys. Oh, but I don't know what you guys are. I don't know. Okay,
[14490.04s -> 14507.43s]  well, you're clicking it. Yeah, I guess you're clicking it. Did you get the ad? Because I just
[14507.43s -> 14513.30s]  played an ad. Apparently commercial break failed. Commercial breaks are only allowed once every
[14513.30s -> 14532.06s]  eight minutes. How does a commercial break fail? That doesn't make any sense. I just clicked run
[14532.06s -> 14542.09s]  ad. No, sorry, it didn't work. But you can't click that again. All right. Well, I can't do it. I
[14542.09s -> 14564.70s]  tried. Do it again. Try again. It's because nobody wants to sponsor you. I don't need a sponsorship.
[14566.68s -> 14587.58s]  I have 5,000 friends here. Think I need a sponsorship? He thinks we like, he thinks we're
[14587.58s -> 14595.32s]  friends. They think we're friends. He thinks we're friends. Why are we both lying to each other? What
[14595.32s -> 14614.73s]  are you talking about? Nope, don't act like that. There's a four. Sorry, guys. We're not real. You're
[14614.73s -> 14629.88s]  very real. All of you. Hmm. Very split on this one. Looks like this is going to be the one.
[14631.62s -> 14638.41s]  We have five community subs that just came in. Thank you for the five community subs.
[14639.21s -> 14646.20s]  It was Piffinator. Thank you, Piff. Guys aren't doing so well on this one. But thanks for the
[14646.20s -> 14652.65s]  community subs. I was just like, I just burped really loud. Hopefully you didn't hear that.
[14657.99s -> 14667.30s]  Win. Which one? Where do you want me to go? Event? I have to get the car eventually.
[14667.30s -> 14679.78s]  We're going over here. You almost, you're almost done. One more three and that's it guys.
[14686.26s -> 14691.53s]  I'll click over here. Click, click feet. No, that's okay. That's not, that's like the
[14691.53s -> 14703.74s]  soda machine. Torpedo sneak. Thanks for the five community subs. Another five gifter come through.
[14703.74s -> 14715.34s]  Thank you so much. Congratulations to the people that got those subs right here. Oh no. Oh no.
[14717.38s -> 14723.85s]  What are you guys going to do now? Tingy, thanks for five community subs, Tingy. That was five,
[14723.85s -> 14749.35s]  10, 15 community subs. Back to back to back. Thanks guys. Right here. First fish. Where is
[14749.35s -> 14754.87s]  the next fish? Gnarly five community subs. Even more. Yeah. More back to back to back to back
[14754.87s -> 14761.90s]  here. More. Another one. Five community subs from Gnarly. Five from Invaderler. Invaderler. Thank
[14761.90s -> 14775.66s]  you. Both of you. The community subs. Much love to all of you. Thank you. You got one more. Tingy with
[14775.66s -> 14785.40s]  another five community subs. Subs just rolling in. Will they get the trunk? Who knows? Thank you for
[14785.40s -> 14792.46s]  the five community subs. That was like fucking 30, 40 back to back there. And there's even more.
[14792.46s -> 14798.22s]  Magellan, thanks for the five community subs. This is the one here. This is it. Okay. If you
[14798.22s -> 14803.27s]  guys don't get this, then I get to buy five more and just spam them. You actually got it. Holy shit.
[14803.27s -> 14842.70s]  They did it. Okay. $50 winner. Nice work, guys. That's my turn. Give me another spade. All right. I
[14842.70s -> 14853.72s]  won two. I won two. I have to win on this one though. I got two for the price of one. You see,
[14853.72s -> 14874.18s]  that two came out. Thanks for winning the $50, guys. I'm putting it to great use. It's my turn
[14874.18s -> 14891.38s]  to get the car. I have to match you guys. It can't be all right in this area. Oh my God. There's a
[14891.38s -> 14909.32s]  boat. I did it too. I did it too. We're even. I did it too. And I'm going to get the fish.
[14910.65s -> 14946.25s]  What happened? Oh, okay. Let's come on. I can get a fish here. Damn it. I can't click the spades.
[14946.25s -> 14972.89s]  It's empty. Come on. No, I can't say it. Holy shit. I got a hot fire. Oh, okay. I need your help.
[14972.89s -> 14980.54s]  I need everybody's help. This is 250 bucks. I need your help. This is the ultimate win. Help me. We
[14980.54s -> 15003.96s]  need to do this together. The broken space? I don't know if I can click the broken space.
[15003.96s -> 15018.49s]  I'll try. That wasn't it. That wasn't it. Got it wrong. I had to click that like 10 times.
[15021.69s -> 15024.89s]  You think it's going to be three in a row? It might, but it might be three in a row
[15025.69s -> 15040.62s]  this way. Not this way. I don't know. I guess. All right. Oh, guys. Come on. No. No, it's not
[15040.62s -> 15055.40s]  working. Thankfully, there's still plenty of spaces because that's the only one I have two of. Okay.
[15058.52s -> 15068.74s]  Right to the right. See if it's three in a row. Hot fire. Hot fire. Hot fire. No, it's water. There
[15068.74s -> 15078.84s]  are now two waters in play. This is our only opportunity to get the ultimate win on any of
[15078.84s -> 15092.66s]  these tickets. I think, you know, there's an equal chance of winning no matter where you click. And
[15092.66s -> 15146.06s]  this is all pointless. What are you talking about? What do you mean? God damn it. Going
[15146.06s -> 15152.49s]  into a gas station and seeing this shit. This would be really, really, really fucking bad.
[15152.49s -> 15179.78s]  I would have gotten thrown out a long time ago. Hold on. Come on. Not a bad start. Come on.
[15181.67s -> 15210.31s]  Pawn the old tickets. I can't actually do this, right? Well, I got enough for one more. What's
[15210.31s -> 15244.14s]  with the fours? This is... I can do it again. I only clicked on threes. Fuck. Come on. Just let me win
[15244.14s -> 15267.90s]  a bay. Let me get a hot ticket item. We're just going to zero. Who cares? We're going to one cent.
[15267.90s -> 15281.21s]  I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I'll fix it. All right. We're good. We're good.
[15283.38s -> 15303.38s]  Let's go try. How much can I get for the tickets? Can I just feed them into there
[15303.38s -> 15322.81s]  if I look up high enough? 50 cents. It's not even worth doing this. I can go just get money from
[15322.81s -> 15338.89s]  Uncle faster than this. Yeah. I might as well go on the money sheen. Money sheen? The money machine.
[15339.70s -> 15351.03s]  Rather than just throw in like the crumpled up ramen bags. What is that? Fucking three bucks?
[15351.03s -> 15366.57s]  Five bucks? Eleven bucks? Six bucks? No. Just leave them. I'm still holding the arcade tickets?
[15367.82s -> 15381.48s]  Oh. Let's go. Let's go back and get some money. I'm gonna go to the beach. We haven't been here yet.
[15381.48s -> 15394.89s]  Are there any games on the beach? There's fireworks at the beach. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out.
[15394.89s -> 15437.75s]  How much are these? Ten dollars? Five dollars? How do I use it? Like that. Okay. Taxi? Taxi?
[15437.75s -> 15459.93s]  All right. I want to go back here. I'm going to get some more money and then I want to... What's
[15459.93s -> 15464.57s]  the... I want to... What do I want to do? I kind of want to play more of these. I'm fucked. I really
[15464.57s -> 15478.94s]  want to play these again. Which one do I want to play? Let's go get money from Dad first.
[15485.56s -> 15495.53s]  What's the most expensive thing? That's like the ultimate win, right? A hundred thousand tickets
[15495.53s -> 15547.34s]  is to get the boombox. I think I can do it. How do I escape this? Cover your ears. What can I sell
[15547.34s -> 15570.34s]  the boombox for? That's the question. Probably a lot. Okay. Let's go play the... Which is the one
[15570.34s -> 15594.36s]  that's easier? The ball drop one or the hockey? You can tell I've lost a step since when I won
[15594.36s -> 15603.34s]  this last time. No. No. No. No. What... This one. This... I just get... Go for the ones that are 500.
[15611.45s -> 15617.00s]  This is probably the best way to do this. Five, 10, 15, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 45. All right. I have to
[15617.00s -> 15630.14s]  get 10 of these to get 5,000. I missed. I need to get 200 balls.
[15635.94s -> 15649.74s]  Well, that's not going to happen. 200. At least I'll be able to get... Well, we're getting a good
[15649.74s -> 15669.58s]  start here. Not bad. 1,500. The hockey game is 2,500 if you get all the fucks. Yeah. Tickets?
[15670.22s -> 15679.00s]  One more ticket. Oh, right. It's a thousand... What about this one? How bad is this one?
[15682.68s -> 15696.63s]  What are we looking for? The green ones, right? Just go anywhere. Isn't there green rings down
[15696.63s -> 15705.11s]  there somewhere? See? Dizzy Bird. I wasn't making... Oh, that's the name of this game.
[15705.11s -> 15709.70s]  When I was shooting the basketball, people were like, oh, at least it's not Dizzy Bird.
[15709.70s -> 15713.70s]  Not Bird. Dizzy Bird. I'm like, what the fuck are they talking about? That's what I was talking
[15713.70s -> 15731.35s]  about. That's a pretty good haul right there. It's not as effective though. Come on. Pick up
[15731.35s -> 15744.70s]  like fucking eight of them. I'm going to try to get this 100 right here. Grab that one right there.
[15744.70s -> 15758.94s]  Slide it. Oh. Didn't get it. That's a pretty good haul. It's a pretty good haul.
[15761.75s -> 15772.25s]  Okay. Let's give Dizzy Bird a try. I feel like he's going to help us out here. Look.
[15780.49s -> 15785.05s]  Oh, man. I thought I did it first fucking try. I thought I did it... Oh, well. I tried. It was
[15785.05s -> 15795.32s]  close. What about this one? This one's pretty good. Uh, pond, pond, right?
[15798.79s -> 15808.82s]  Getting the Mega Jackpot. Come on. What's that? Mystery? Mystery bonus?
[15815.06s -> 15816.90s]  I'll take it. That sounds pretty good to me. Nice.
[15822.01s -> 15826.09s]  Shit. I got to get that. What's the Mega Jackpot? It's not even listed.
[15827.86s -> 15833.77s]  Jackpot. It's 2,100. What's the Mega Jackpot? It's not even listed.
[15834.57s -> 15853.69s]  Oh. Add a bonus ball. We're going to wait for that. Wait for the Jackpot to come back again.
[15856.73s -> 15863.14s]  Pretty close. Under the table. What about it?
[15867.67s -> 15877.98s]  Bonus ball. Oh, it's just doing it. I didn't even click. What does this mean? Get in there.
[15881.64s -> 15897.00s]  Oh. That's coming to the side of the machine. There are tickets over there.
[15897.00s -> 15898.28s]  You're right. There are tickets that way.
[15913.86s -> 15920.06s]  Get in. I thought I was going to go on the jackpot. $50. I just won 50 bucks right there.
[15920.06s -> 15928.47s]  Bonus ball. The ball of koala just gave me $50 and then I got the jackpot. This is fucking 10,000
[15928.47s -> 15934.63s]  tickets. This is going to be a big haul. I bet you can't get the double green on Dizzy Bird.
[15937.45s -> 15944.01s]  Thanks for the 50 bucks, ball of koala. Bonus ball. But first of all, we've got to talk about
[15944.01s -> 15951.18s]  the big haul that's coming out through here. I reset both the jackpots. Bonus ball. Two Mega
[15951.18s -> 15965.83s]  Jackpots. Do it. All right. This is like 12,000 tickets. Jesus Christ. How is that not 12,000?
[15968.54s -> 15975.78s]  What? The top was like 4,800 and the... What do you... What's this mean? What do you mean by that?
[15987.13s -> 16000.71s]  We're like 10% of the way there. 14 tickets, guys. Who cares? Who even wants these? All right.
[16002.07s -> 16011.70s]  Okay. Let's do the hockey. I gotta get a hockey. That's 500. I'm all right with this.
[16018.09s -> 16025.37s]  It's too slow. It's too slow. The fish game. The fish game's not gonna... The fish games
[16025.37s -> 16045.50s]  will be very inefficient. Just like the Bruins. What? Get in there. We want the bird game. No.
[16046.14s -> 16052.30s]  That's not efficient. This is more efficient. If I can... I gotta get hockey at least once.
[16052.30s -> 16076.20s]  2,500 guaranteed tickets. All right. I gotta be early. Like right... The bird is not efficient.
[16076.20s -> 16078.60s]  The bird sucks. It's not gonna help us at all.
[16081.32s -> 16095.27s]  This is actually turning out to be very inefficient as well. Am I scoring on my own goal?
[16096.15s -> 16111.98s]  All right. I got the C. We've got plenty of time. There's a shitload of tickets on the ground.
[16120.47s -> 16147.69s]  Oh. H. Oh, you kidding me? Really? Do they stay forever? They have to, right? Well, the one...
[16147.69s -> 16152.81s]  At least the one cool part is the soundtrack, the sound right now is doing the thing. When you go
[16152.81s -> 16161.05s]  into a place like Radio Shack that has a keyboard and it's on display and you're allowed to play
[16161.05s -> 16166.01s]  with it, you just do the same four chords like the same chord like a thousand times. That's
[16166.01s -> 16174.02s]  like all I hear. You turn it on. You put it on like the horn and you just press down on the same
[16174.02s -> 16181.02s]  chord. It was hard for me to say that because it was so loud in my ear that it was making me
[16181.02s -> 16194.86s]  hard to talk. I was getting speech jammed by the fucking Radio Shack keyboard. All right.
[16194.86s -> 16222.58s]  I just need an Y and an H. All right. Sir, sir, sir, sir. Can you stop that, please?
[16224.22s -> 16227.02s]  You're really pissing off all the customers here. $2,000.
[16240.94s -> 16244.82s]  2200 tickets. All right. Let's get them. I don't want to play again.
[16246.42s -> 16251.74s]  All right. Let's go. Feed it in. How many do I have?
[16251.74s -> 16266.18s]  10% of the way there. All right. What's the most pumped? What about these ones?
[16266.90s -> 16279.66s]  No, this thing's really bad, right? What about the stackums? What gives the most tickets?
[16280.30s -> 16286.66s]  This thing is awful. The Big Bass is the worst machine. It gives like four tickets, guys,
[16286.66s -> 16293.21s]  even if it was a thousand. That's not worth it. I can go get a thousand right now from the hockey
[16293.29s -> 16307.06s]  game. Oh, you got yourself 10 tickets. That's terrible. I didn't give this one a chance.
[16311.90s -> 16343.26s]  So you knock down all the stuff. Don't touch shovel handle. What happens if you get all the
[16343.26s -> 16366.36s]  chests? That's all chests. That's it? What's the top one? I don't have to get all the balls off?
[16366.44s -> 16401.67s]  I'm gonna do this like a lawn. All right. I'm ready. Here we go. How the fuck are you supposed
[16401.67s -> 16409.85s]  to do this? Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. Why was it? Was it not counting these treasures before?
[16415.77s -> 16470.65s]  Let's get inside out. What? Oh, I touched the shovel. Shit. Do it again. Inside out. I'm out of
[16470.65s -> 16482.47s]  time. I feel like this one's too rigged. I'm gonna do one more technique.
[16483.93s -> 16518.58s]  It's not a bad technique if you go around in a circle and you push out.
[16522.49s -> 16530.90s]  Last try. Yeah, it's like scrubbing a toilet. It is. Let's try that again, but I'm gonna start
[16530.90s -> 16536.49s]  right from the middle. I'm just gonna do a circle around it. Just get right here. Don't touch it.
[16536.49s -> 16541.13s]  You just go like this. Oh, fuck. That's how you do it. I know that's how you do it. You gotta go.
[16541.13s -> 16582.79s]  You get a toilet brush it. You just gotta be very careful. This game's stupid. This is
[16582.79s -> 16612.06s]  dumb. All right. What about the coin ones? Why is he so bad? No, stop that. Stop saying that.
[16612.06s -> 16625.85s]  You know it makes me angry. Hold on. I'm gonna do this. I'm gonna stop at the minor prize this time
[16625.85s -> 16649.64s]  and see how many tickets it is. All right. How many tickets is the minor prize? What a joke.
[16649.64s -> 16659.53s]  Not even worth it. How much was this one? A hundred? Does it increase in value as you
[16659.53s -> 16680.68s]  go up? I bet it does. Did I just fucking do that first try? I did. So how much is the top row?
[16680.68s -> 16690.44s]  It has to be worth something. If this is a hundred tickets, then why the hell did you ever do this?
[16691.64s -> 16711.26s]  All right. Well, okay. Terror. That sounds good to me. Just do that every time. I can do this.
[16730.39s -> 16737.94s]  No, a little too early. I can hold it a little longer. I need to do this 88 times.
[16743.75s -> 16760.18s]  And you want me to do the bass game? What's more reliable? I did it too high. Too high. The bird is
[16760.18s -> 16773.99s]  faster. Let us play the lottery tickets again. But yeah, I have to have money before I do that
[16773.99s -> 16779.88s]  and I make money by doing this and then get in the boom box and sell in the boom box. That's it.
[16782.14s -> 16790.97s]  All right. This is stupid. I did it first try. Nobody who cares. Just give me my thousand
[16790.97s -> 16802.52s]  tickets and get me out of here. All right. Prize balls. This seems the fastest.
[16812.46s -> 16821.10s]  1500 is ski balls the most reliable? Is it though? How many tickets do you get for doing ski ball?
[16826.92s -> 16844.42s]  Come on. That's a good, that's a good grab. Yeah, it is. Do ball drop. Just, you can ace it every
[16844.42s -> 16861.64s]  time. Is it, is it 500 or a thousand? Doing the ball drop. I mean, this is two grand. You
[16861.64s -> 16871.29s]  know what I'm saying? Like how long is that? 30 seconds. Five, 10, 15. That was 15, 10. All
[16871.29s -> 16885.72s]  right. Hold on. Let me feed that through. How much does the headphone sell for? Um, I think 100.
[16886.44s -> 16899.16s]  Let me see. How efficient am I in this one? I'm usually pretty efficient, right? It fights. What
[16899.16s -> 16931.66s]  is it? What's the jackpot? 500? 500, right? All right. This is the only game they come over to
[16931.66s -> 16939.37s]  congratulate you on. Do it again. Let's go. I just need to do this like 115 times.
[16942.22s -> 17006.50s]  Okay. Until I, do it until I, until I don't do it. And okay. Go. Go until I lose.
[17053.83s -> 17076.09s]  What is so funny? This. Okay. I fucked it up. Got it.
[17077.99s -> 17096.42s]  Weee. Only, this never before. Is anything like this ever possible?
[17098.71s -> 17118.23s]  I fucking blew it. It's, I need to move on. I'm like, what I'm doing right now?
[17119.11s -> 17125.56s]  I'm playing a fake arcade machine. There's a, this is a, there's a real version of this and there's
[17125.56s -> 17131.08s]  like 5,000 people watching me do the fake arcade machine to try to make
[17131.16s -> 17137.48s]  100,000 fake tickets to buy a fake boom box to scratch fake lottery tickets on stream.
[17143.45s -> 17150.89s]  It's like starting to get in my head. All right. So.
[17155.38s -> 17171.27s]  Okay. I need to fucking relax. What do I have? 15%? What's the most? Okay. Ski ball. Somebody said
[17171.27s -> 17183.54s]  do ski ball. Is this actually efficient if I just do it right down the middle? That's 40. A little
[17183.54s -> 17192.76s]  bit higher, right? Right before the yellow? No, that's too high. That's too higher? Higher?
[17192.76s -> 17211.35s]  That's too higher. I'm sorry guys. That's a little too higher. There it is. What was up with that?
[17212.89s -> 17219.19s]  Jerma, wake up, please. Stop that.
[17230.66s -> 17233.62s]  You want to know what your tarot reading said? My friend says you'll freak out.
[17234.52s -> 17238.44s]  No, I don't want to do tarot reading. I thought about it would be fun to do like a tarot reading
[17238.44s -> 17243.72s]  on stream of myself, but it's probably going to be like death, death, death, puke, puke,
[17244.28s -> 17262.36s]  like you're going to lose all your money for that pathetic display. That's not bad. Hold on.
[17265.26s -> 17291.00s]  What is up with this physics? The claw. Somebody did the math and that was another thing I was
[17291.00s -> 17297.40s]  laughing at. Somebody did the math and they said you just do the balloon claw game and try to get
[17297.48s -> 17304.20s]  what free 500 balloons. And if you just do it efficiently, it'll take 22 minutes.
[17305.08s -> 17309.56s]  And then I'm sitting there thinking, is that, is that, do I really want to do that?
[17309.56s -> 17326.34s]  I don't know if that's something I actually wanted to. 600. Come on, give me 600.
[17328.02s -> 17343.51s]  You did the bird game for 54 minutes. That's, yes, that is also true. All right, let's go.
[17343.75s -> 17352.38s]  Um, what about these? No, that's not that efficient either. Okay, I'm going to go for
[17352.38s -> 17368.06s]  balloons for a little while until I can't take it anymore. You've been playing this for five hours.
[17368.06s -> 17372.78s]  You can do 22 minutes on the balloons. Yeah, but it's, there's a difference between
[17372.78s -> 17381.26s]  bonds at 22 straight minutes of me picking up 500 ticket balloons. That's a different story.
[17388.12s -> 17398.44s]  I missed. Bird game streams are entertaining to watch you.
[17419.78s -> 17427.29s]  You know, if it was allowed, 22 minutes is a one episode of Spongebob. I would just put it on the
[17427.29s -> 17444.41s]  screen and just do this. All right, let's do it. Hold on. What happens if you do, can I overflow
[17444.41s -> 17451.94s]  the balls? Put it on the background. No, I can't do that. I will get actually like terms of service
[17451.94s -> 17462.18s]  screamed at. What's the red ones? How much are the red ones worth?
[17463.54s -> 17483.46s]  250? What if I get them all? Just have text to speech, read a Spongebob script.
[17503.03s -> 17510.54s]  You can't fit that many characters in a text to speech program. Just read it and play every part.
[17510.54s -> 17530.02s]  I can't do that and play. Hold on. Let me just get out of this. Is it, is it okay? Is there a website
[17530.02s -> 17535.30s]  where I can have that happen that can take like a like that's too long to put in a text to speech
[17535.30s -> 17567.26s]  box? You read it. I can't do that. Put it into Google Translate. Oh my God. Hold on. Let me wait,
[17567.26s -> 17581.00s]  wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Is this even possible? This is Spongebob.Fan. This is the Mermaid Man and
[17581.00s -> 17606.14s]  Barnacle Boy transcript. Is this actually the right one? Is this a fan one? This, this is,
[17606.14s -> 17618.04s]  this doesn't seem to be very much dialogue. So this is the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy
[17619.00s -> 17632.17s]  of reenactment by, and we're going to do speed, speed like three or four. Okay. Okay. Here we go.
[17632.17s -> 17639.29s]  Just relax. Oh my God. It's crashing my computer. I think.
[17654.81s -> 17660.89s]  Also these guys. Barnacle Boy enters the Krusty Krab. Barnacle Boy. I told you I'm not hungry.
[17660.89s -> 17666.49s]  Mermaid Man. Mermaid Man and nonsense. Barnacle Boy. We've got to keep up our strength for the
[17666.49s -> 17672.58s]  fight against evil. Barnacle Boy. Want to dive Mermaid Man to the register. Runs to the register.
[17674.58s -> 17680.63s]  Can I help you? It's too fast. It's too fast. It's too fast. It's too fast. And that's like the
[17680.63s -> 17685.19s]  jokey. That's like the meme guy. It's gotta be somebody else. All right. We'll try this.
[17686.46s -> 17692.94s]  Squidward. Can I help you? Mermaid Man. A double Krabby Patty and Coral Bits for me
[17692.94s -> 17699.58s]  and a silly meal for the lad. Barnacle Boy. It's not for the toy. I just, I've got to fit in the
[17699.58s -> 17707.59s]  tights. Why can't oh, he smiles nervously. Squidward. Whatever. Five dollars. Please.
[17708.74s -> 17716.12s]  Mermaid Man. You got it. Bucky. Removes his left seashell cup. Opens the shell up like a clutch
[17716.12s -> 17720.92s]  purse and pulls out a metal nut. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Did I get
[17720.92s -> 17729.70s]  fucking linked to something fucked up here? Is this the, is this an actual real one? This is not
[17729.70s -> 17743.46s]  something fucked up weird like mermaid man porn thing, right? This is the episode. Okay. Close
[17743.46s -> 17748.90s]  up of the nut and a timpani noise is heard. Squidward. No Barnacle Boy. Confront Squidward.
[17748.90s -> 17753.94s]  Listen. Big Nose. Points at Mermaid Man. That guy has been saving your butt since before you were
[17753.94s -> 17760.46s]  born. Don't you got a living legend discounts or something? Squidward. This is a restaurant,
[17760.46s -> 17764.62s]  not a lending library. What's wrong with this guy? Pokes Barnacle Boy. And are you calling
[17764.62s -> 17771.90s]  Big Nose? Pokes Barnacle Boy again. Big Nose. Both press noses against each other. Barnacle Boy
[17771.90s -> 17777.66s]  gets out a $5 bill from his hat and he throws it to Squidward. Barnacle Boy. Well, next time
[17777.66s -> 17784.62s]  danger threatens. Don't expect any help from us. Squidward. Grabs the bill. Sarcastically. I'm
[17784.62s -> 17792.31s]  shaken. Hey. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. SpongeBob. Slowly breaks through wall. Mermaid Man and
[17792.31s -> 17798.07s]  Barnacle Boy. Must get autograph. Stretch his arm to pull the pen from Tom's shirt pocket and
[17798.07s -> 17803.70s]  stretch his second arm to grab a paper from the window. Mermaid Man. If you wanna grow up strong
[17803.70s -> 17809.72s]  like me. Shows his fat belly. Shocking Barnacle Boy. You gotta leave room for seconds. Here comes
[17809.72s -> 17817.37s]  our waiter. SpongeBob. Runs while making a weird face. Autograph. Barnacle Boy. Holy sea cow. It's
[17817.37s -> 17825.78s]  that sponge kid. Mermaid Man. Quick lad. Pants falls down to the invisible boat mobile. Runs outside
[17825.78s -> 17833.61s]  while holding his pants away. Barnacle Boy. Where do we park? Mermaid Man. A SpongeBob. Can I have
[17833.61s -> 17839.48s]  your autograph? Can I have your autograph? Can I? They're gone. Gasps. Mermaid Man's belt.
[17840.55s -> 17846.55s]  Mermaid Man. Wait! We'll find it with the invisible boat alarm. He pulls it out and makes
[17846.55s -> 17851.03s]  his depressal button. Why was he acting there? A car flickers in and out of visibility. Thrives.
[17851.03s -> 17857.34s]  Making beeps as well. There she is. They run over and jump in the car. Barnacle Boy hits the seat
[17857.34s -> 17864.86s]  divider. Barnacle Boy. Wait! Rubs his behind. I told you we surely got the automatic. SpongeBob.
[17864.86s -> 17871.50s]  Hey guys. Wait up. Pulling out Mermaid Man's bell. Slow motion. I've got something for you.
[17872.54s -> 17880.49s]  Barnacle Boy. Both speed off in the boat. SpongeBob. You forgot your belt. You forgot.
[17880.57s -> 17884.41s]  Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy drive away Mermaid Man's secret utility belt.
[17885.35s -> 17891.56s]  The emblem of submersible justice. For 65 years, this belt has helped prevent the fall of nations
[17891.56s -> 17898.33s]  and pants. I can't believe I'm actually holding it in my hands. Well, I guess I should return it.
[17899.14s -> 17903.38s]  Makes one step in the boat's direction then sprints back to the kitchen with the belt on or not.
[17904.33s -> 17908.41s]  Giggles. I could just hang onto till after work all alone with Mermaid Man's belt.
[17909.26s -> 17914.57s]  I wonder what this button does. Presses the belt and a pickle barrel shrinks. Whoa.
[17915.50s -> 17920.39s]  Grabs the shrunken barrel. The small ray. He giggles and smiles mischievously.
[17920.95s -> 17926.79s]  Squidward, here's your shake, sir. He starts to hand him the shake, but he starts making loud
[17926.79s -> 17930.87s]  noise from the kitchen and SpongeBob's giggle, causing him to accidentally drop the shake on
[17930.87s -> 17937.11s]  the guy's head. The guy punches Squidward in the face and storms out. There are more flashes,
[17937.11s -> 17941.43s]  noises, and giggles from the kitchen. Squidward gets up and he holds his head.
[17941.43s -> 17946.76s]  GRR. SpongeBob hands a tiny Krabby Patty to a cockroach. There you go.
[17947.96s -> 17955.08s]  That's not even real. This is a fake episode. Squidward, SpongeBob, what's going on in here?
[17956.84s -> 17961.72s]  SpongeBob wears a tiny hat and holds a tiny spatula and the cockroach is eating a Krabby
[17961.72s -> 17967.08s]  Patty while sitting on the shrunken dining table. Why is everything all tiny? SpongeBob
[17967.08s -> 17972.68s]  turns the belt around to hide it from Squidward. I don't know. Squidward, what do you got there?
[17973.64s -> 17981.08s]  SpongeBob, nothing Squidward. No. Really? SpongeBob, nothing Squidward. You've got something?
[17981.08s -> 17986.66s]  All right. Let's see it. Krabby Patty grabs SpongeBob and sees Mermaid Man's belt.
[17986.66s -> 17993.22s]  What the hell did I just get? SpongeBob, no. No. Squidward gasps. Is that Mermaid Man's belt?
[17994.17s -> 18002.07s]  SpongeBob, yes Squidward. Wow. I can't believe he'd lend it to you. SpongeBob, me, I either.
[18002.07s -> 18009.96s]  Chuckles nervously. Squidward gasps. He didn't lend it to you, did he? SpongeBob, please don't tell.
[18010.60s -> 18018.68s]  Squidward, angry. You stoned. SpongeBob, please don't tell. Squidward, oh, I'm telling.
[18018.68s -> 18025.29s]  SpongeBob, Squidward, if Mermaid Man finds out, he'll kick me out of his fan club for sure.
[18025.29s -> 18031.56s]  Please don't tell. Squidward, uh-oh, points at the phone hanging on a kitchen wall. There's the
[18031.56s -> 18037.88s]  phone. SpongeBob, don't. Is the episode almost over? Squidward, I'm walking towards the phone.
[18037.88s -> 18044.06s]  Slowly walks towards the phone. How long is this episode? SpongeBob, no. Squidward, slowly reaches
[18044.06s -> 18051.38s]  for the phone. I'm getting closer to the phone. SpongeBob, sobbing, do-oh-not. Squidward picks up
[18051.38s -> 18057.75s]  the phone, ready to call Mermaid Man. And now, for the moment we've all been waiting for. SpongeBob,
[18057.75s -> 18064.22s]  wails and tears himself. I'm begging you. Squidward, hello. I'd like to speak to Mermaid.
[18064.22s -> 18071.10s]  SpongeBob shrinks. Squidward, he lands on the table. What the? What? Phones hit Squidward on
[18071.10s -> 18078.78s]  the head. Ow. Mermaid Man on phone. Hello? Hello? Squidward, what did you do to me?
[18079.90s -> 18086.90s]  SpongeBob, I'm sorry, Squidward, but you made me do it. Squidward, SpongeBob, if you don't return
[18086.90s -> 18093.54s]  me to normal size right now, you're gonna be in really big trouble. SpongeBob, uh-huh, okay. Uh,
[18094.65s -> 18100.73s]  Squidward, I said no. SpongeBob, uh, belt is shown to have several complicated buttons. Uh,
[18101.70s -> 18106.42s]  Squidward, do you hear me? SpongeBob zaps Squidward and he appears with multiple eyes
[18106.42s -> 18112.01s]  with hissing snakes. Holy fish paste. Get it off me. Get it off me. I can't take it anymore.
[18112.01s -> 18117.86s]  Take size off him in pants and fear. Don't you know how to work that thing? SpongeBob, uh,
[18117.94s -> 18123.06s]  I can do it. SpongeBob changes Squidward into a burning mess, then changes him to have an
[18123.06s -> 18128.89s]  enormous nose, then to have no skin, then cut in half by scissors. What? Then changed into more
[18128.89s -> 18135.77s]  things off screen while SpongeBob looks in fright. Squidward screams whenever SpongeBob changes him.
[18135.77s -> 18142.20s]  Squidward looks burnt after SpongeBob's failed attempts to revert him. Stop. I've got an idea.
[18142.20s -> 18150.12s]  You stopped my game. Let's call Mermaid Man and SpongeBob snatching Squidward. No. I can't let
[18150.12s -> 18156.02s]  you do that, but there must be someone else who can help. Someone smart and wise with years of
[18156.02s -> 18162.60s]  life experience. He runs to Patrick's house where Patrick is sleeping. Patrick. I can't do it anymore.
[18162.60s -> 18168.68s]  Okay. I'll do it like speed, like five. I can't hear it anymore. Let's, uh, Mike, take it. Take
[18168.68s -> 18173.96s]  us away, Mike. He runs to Patrick's house where Patrick is sleeping. Patrick, Patrick, Patrick,
[18174.52s -> 18180.92s]  Patrick wakes up due to surprise. Oh, hi, SpongeBob, SpongeBob, Patrick. I was at work and Mermaid Man
[18180.92s -> 18184.68s]  and Barnacle Boy came, and I got this belt. And look, chose Patrick, the shrunken Squidward.
[18185.24s -> 18190.52s]  Patrick, a Squidward action figure. Grab Squidward, let me play with him. SpongeBob, no. Just give me
[18190.52s -> 18195.70s]  the ones in the corner. Imitates jet plane diving, machine gunfire, and explosion noises dive bomb.
[18195.70s -> 18199.70s]  SpongeBob, Patrick, Patrick, about to punch Squidward, and then comes a giant fist.
[18199.70s -> 18204.50s]  SpongeBob, Patrick, no, that's not an action figure. That's the real Squidward. I shrunk him by
[18204.50s -> 18208.86s]  accident. Patrick, oh, about to punch Squidward anyway, and then comes a giant Squidward screams.
[18208.86s -> 18212.86s]  SpongeBob stops Patrick. Wait, you don't understand. This is serious. I don't know how to
[18212.86s -> 18217.08s]  unshrink him. Slow it. I could be stuck like this for the rest of his life. Patrick, oh, don't worry
[18217.08s -> 18222.68s]  about it. He'll find love one day. SpongeBob, you think so? There's no comedic timing, but it'll be
[18222.68s -> 18228.01s]  with someone his own size. Pulls out a pickle like this pickle. See, they like each other. Squidward,
[18228.01s -> 18232.79s]  and then Patrick bangs them together as it's a kiss. Squidward is disgusted. SpongeBob, oh,
[18232.79s -> 18237.21s]  if only I knew how to work this thing. Patrick, let me take a look at it. HMM, you know what the
[18237.21s -> 18240.65s]  problem is? I'm not going to be able to get this done. Patrick, you got to set the points to the
[18240.65s -> 18244.49s]  M.M. formula when it should be set to turns M around W. I'm going to have to. I got to play
[18244.49s -> 18248.79s]  the game. I don't think wumbo is a real word. Patrick, come on. You know I wumbo, you wumbo,
[18248.79s -> 18253.11s]  the cheaply wumbo. Wumbo, wumboing, we'll have the wumbo, wumbo-rumbo-wumbology, the study of
[18253.11s -> 18257.45s]  wumbo. It's first grade, SpongeBob. Squidward, while Patrick is saying we'll have the wumbo,
[18257.45s -> 18261.27s]  I wonder if the fall from this height could be enough to kill me. SpongeBob, Patrick, I'm sorry,
[18261.27s -> 18266.55s]  I doubted you. Patrick, well, all right, then. Let her rip. SpongeBob uses Mermaid Man's belt and
[18266.55s -> 18269.99s]  presses something to try and regrow Squidward. Only Patrick and Squidward are both shrunk,
[18269.99s -> 18275.24s]  now it worked. SpongeBob, oh no. Patrick, look, SpongeBob's giant. SpongeBob grabs them,
[18275.24s -> 18280.60s]  can I be giant next? SpongeBob, Patrick, I'm not giant, you shrunk too. Patrick, you're kidding.
[18280.60s -> 18284.94s]  Pulls out his pickle, good thing I still got his pickle. Kisses the pickle three times. Pan over
[18284.94s -> 18290.33s]  to Squidward. Squidward, they. Now will you take us to Mermaid Man? SpongeBob yells in Squidward's
[18290.33s -> 18295.27s]  face, no. He can never find out, but I'll think of something. I promise. Gets a jar and puts them
[18295.27s -> 18299.59s]  in until then. You'll be safe in this jar. Patrick, you know what's funny? My pickle started out in a
[18299.59s -> 18305.59s]  jar and now it's in one again. They. It's like a pun or something. SpongeBob, it's only two people,
[18305.59s -> 18309.59s]  no big deal. Somebody said this is giving me a stomach ache. Sandy suddenly appears. Sandy, hi,
[18309.59s -> 18314.79s]  SpongeBob. SpongeBob screams Sandy. Shrinks Sandy. Sandy lands on the ground. What did you four
[18314.79s -> 18319.11s]  crying out? What did you all do to me? SpongeBob, I'm sorry, Sandy. Mermaid Man came in and Larry
[18319.11s -> 18324.98s]  appears. God damn it, why? They. SpongeBob shrinks Larry. Nat, they. SpongeBob, I shrinks Nat.
[18324.98s -> 18329.67s]  Nancy Susie Fish. Hi, SpongeBob. Shrinks Nancy. SpongeBob screams and makes a run for it.
[18329.67s -> 18334.07s]  What is this? It's coming out of the. SpongeBob shrinks Mrs. Puff. It's out of the machine.
[18334.07s -> 18339.19s]  Shrinks Scooter, Sandals and Dennis. Fish number one. They. SpongeBob. This shit's out of the machine.
[18339.19s -> 18344.81s]  Fish number two. SpongeBob. Hi. Shrinks Fish. Fish number three. They. SpongeBob. Shrinks Fish.
[18344.81s -> 18349.37s]  Fish number four. What's up? Sponge. Shrinks Fish. SpongeBob tries to fit everyone in the jar,
[18349.37s -> 18354.17s]  Wu. I'm going to have to get a bigger jar. Squidward, SpongeBob, will you just face facts?
[18355.22s -> 18359.32s]  I think it's almost done. You've got to go to Mermaid Man. SpongeBob. Oh, Squidward,
[18359.32s -> 18363.96s]  he'll be so disappointed. Sandy, well, you can't leave us small forever. SpongeBob, you don't
[18363.96s -> 18367.90s]  understand. SpongeBob's mother is seen in the jar. Mrs. Squarepants. What do you mean it's not?
[18367.90s -> 18372.14s]  It's about halfway. You need to admit your mistakes. I'm not at halfway. SpongeBob. Mom.
[18372.14s -> 18377.03s]  Mermaid Man, your mother's right, son. Mermaid Man will understand. Barnacle Boy, you're Mermaid Man,
[18377.03s -> 18381.91s]  you old coot. Mermaid Man. Oh, yes, SpongeBob. Mermaid Man, I'm so sorry. It's just that I'm
[18381.91s -> 18386.33s]  such a big fan. And your belt. And Mermaid Man, comforting SpongeBob. Oh, don't worry, son.
[18387.05s -> 18390.49s]  I understand. SpongeBob smiles, with tears still pooling in his eyes. Why? I remember back when I
[18390.49s -> 18394.65s]  first used the belt. The year was 19, not 11, 12. Why I believe the president. Everyone, just tell
[18394.65s -> 18401.29s]  him how to unshrink us. I need to have a different person doing this. They're all freaking me out.
[18401.29s -> 18410.07s]  Let's have Rachel come in. Everyone, just tell him how to unshrink us. Mermaid Man. Oh, yes,
[18410.07s -> 18417.32s]  the unshrinked ray. Let's see. Did you set it to one bow? Everyone, what? The jar rumbles from anger,
[18417.32s -> 18422.78s]  and everyone flies out of their jar, spells out and form Get SpongeBob. Get SpongeBob. Climbs up
[18422.78s -> 18427.74s]  SpongeBob's body and into the holes in his head. Squidward, now I have to drive five miles to go
[18427.74s -> 18432.94s]  to the bathroom in my own home. What? Kicks SpongeBob's stomach. Sandy, and I need an elevator
[18432.94s -> 18438.78s]  to climb one stair. Why does he keep doing this? Punches his brain. Mermaid Man, we've been shrinking
[18438.78s -> 18445.74s]  for years. Barnacle Boy, but this is ridiculous. Both kick his eyeballs. Dale kicks his pelvis.
[18445.82s -> 18450.87s]  Nancy chops off one of his lungs while hanging onto his spine. Larry kicks his knee. SpongeBob
[18450.87s -> 18456.90s]  is shown getting hurt from the outside. Everyone, everything's too big. SpongeBob, I've got it.
[18456.90s -> 18461.14s]  Squidward soars a blood vein and Frank tries to break a bone, but stop when SpongeBob shrinks
[18461.14s -> 18466.12s]  the city. Tarder. Everyone looks outside through his holes. Since I couldn't make you big, I made
[18466.12s -> 18472.71s]  the city small. Everybody leaves SpongeBob's body, and now only one more thing to shrink. Cheese.
[18472.71s -> 18477.56s]  Turns the shrink ray into W and towards him like a camera and shrinks himself. Squidward,
[18477.56s -> 18484.10s]  I guess this is okay. Larry, yeah, what's the difference? Nancy, good idea. SpongeBob,
[18484.10s -> 18488.58s]  everyone cheers. Balloons and other party items are flying. As a bus comes back and Plankton gets off
[18488.58s -> 18492.81s]  of it. It is a classic, you're right. Plankton, well, it's great to be back. Really, it's great
[18492.81s -> 18515.26s]  to be back, SpongeBob. That's the whole episode? That's it. Okay, it hasn't been 22 minutes though.
[18515.26s -> 18525.16s]  Hey, you guys want to watch more TV? Because I'm only at 30,000. Oh, that's right, SpongeBob
[18525.16s -> 18533.93s]  episodes are 11 minutes long. No, I'm not, we don't have to do any more SpongeBob transcripts.
[18539.43s -> 18551.14s]  No, no, I, we just did that for like seven straight minutes. What the fuck is that? This is,
[18556.04s -> 18571.64s]  really? I can't, this actually exists? All right, I'll put this one on. I gotta replace this. Hold
[18571.64s -> 18593.51s]  on. Okay, let's do, um, Rod. Okay, Rod, let's hear it. Rats, rats, we're rats, we're the rats.
[18594.50s -> 18600.76s]  We pray at night, we stalk at night, we're the rats. Giant rat, I'm da giant rat that makes all
[18600.76s -> 18608.14s]  of da rules. Rats, let's see what kind of trouble we can get ourselves into. Dick, so sue me for
[18608.14s -> 18614.15s]  being thorough, I wanna know that you know what the plan is. Trenchcoat man, look, seriously,
[18614.15s -> 18619.98s]  mate, how many artifacts do we need to steal before you trust me with these jobs? Dick, well,
[18619.98s -> 18624.14s]  I just want to make sure you know what's happening. We're gonna get the treasure, we're gonna get out
[18624.14s -> 18631.18s]  of there and we're all stars mumbling. Blue man, who ha ha. Dick, and we must get it. That's the
[18631.18s -> 18638.14s]  most important thing. So beyond your game, we go now. Blue man, I get to drive the car today
[18638.14s -> 18642.94s]  because it's my birthday. Dick, no, don't let him get in the car, please don't let.
[18643.99s -> 18650.95s]  Blue man, quietly, come on. Dick, oh, he's driving, whatever. I can't, put it down. Bloody hell.
[18651.83s -> 18655.19s]  It's trying to get out. More importantly, it's trying to get out. Did we have a rat problem?
[18656.17s -> 18662.87s]  Dick, we don't. Get in. Let's go, speed it up. Yeah, that's the speed I'm looking for. That's
[18662.87s -> 18669.51s]  the kind of fastness I want. Asterisk cuts to the town asterisk. Dick, I don't even know where you're
[18669.51s -> 18676.12s]  going at this point. We've been driving all night. Blue man, it's my birthday. Dick, hey you, you just
[18676.12s -> 18682.97s]  you're running over a guy right now. He's fucking serious. Trench cold man, can you remind me next
[18682.97s -> 18689.05s]  time we do this? I'm getting my nan to drive. Asterisk camera cuts inside of a cafe shop asterisk.
[18690.14s -> 18695.66s]  Clerk, um, excuse me, sir. Yeah, you over there dancing. It's actually $10 to dance in this
[18695.66s -> 18700.78s]  building. So you're going to have to give me, we're all going to die. Dick, ladies and gentlemen of
[18700.78s -> 18706.38s]  the jury, may I have the attention of the class? My name is Dick Dastardly, Richard, and I'm here
[18706.38s -> 18712.62s]  to take the treasure chest that's in the back room. Go get it, boys. I'll follow you in. And let me
[18712.62s -> 18716.94s]  tell you something, clerk. If you so ask, move it muscle. I'll make sure you stay buried in that
[18716.94s -> 18722.94s]  ground there. All right, let's go. Dick goes into the Mayan temple. The golden statue comes alive
[18722.94s -> 18729.02s]  and follows him. Dick, all right. Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme. Is the treasure in there?
[18729.98s -> 18738.06s]  Is it in there? Trench cold man? Yeah, it's all here. Dick? Oh, yes. No, that's what I like to hear.
[18739.03s -> 18745.19s]  And now we are invincible. Gerard? Not so fast. Gerard? You stand before Gerard, guardian of the
[18745.19s -> 18750.71s]  treasure chest of the Mayan temple, and they will make sure to hey. Giant rat picks him up and throws
[18750.71s -> 18757.83s]  him into the abyss. Trench cold man? Oh, fuck this. I'm off. Gerard? Hey, what are you doing?
[18758.79s -> 18765.99s]  Rats? We're the rats. We pray at night. We stalk at night. We're the rats. Dick? All right. Yay.
[18765.99s -> 18770.95s]  That's cool. Yeah. I like rats. Nothing bad with rats. But let me tell you something. Over my dead
[18770.95s -> 18779.19s]  body. Are you getting this treasure? Rats? Rats? Rats? Rats? Rats? Blue man? Oh, man. Look at that
[18779.19s -> 18784.39s]  flock of birds over there. That reminds me of my favorite movie. The movie. That's your favorite
[18784.39s -> 18790.23s]  movie too, right? Giant rat? No, my favorite movie is Frozen. I like Elsa and Anna. Okay,
[18790.23s -> 18795.75s]  now I kill you, kick. Got it. Blue man? Wow. No, that's great pick choice for favoriteist movie.
[18795.75s -> 18801.59s]  I wonder if I have to think that now. Small slash giant rat. Now I get to be the giant rat. Cool
[18801.59s -> 18808.39s]  surprise. Camera moves back to the town where the police have arrived. Police officer. So you're
[18808.39s -> 18812.71s]  trying to tell me that inside this building right here, there is a giant rat. Among other things,
[18813.67s -> 18820.07s]  did he say Pickles? Or am I putting that in there by myself? Whatever. Sergeant Pickles is
[18820.07s -> 18823.75s]  going to go in there and check it out. We're going to make sure everything's okay. And I'll get me
[18823.75s -> 18829.26s]  some candy corn too. That's a weird request. I know, but just get it. Camera cuts back into the
[18829.26s -> 18834.68s]  cafe shop. Giant rat. You guys are going to drop it and we're going to be in big trouble. So quit
[18834.68s -> 18843.00s]  prancing around. Yes, it does. Hello, sir. Welcome to the rat cafe. There's no rats here. There's
[18843.00s -> 18848.68s]  just the hamburgers. Police officer too. Yeah, that would be real nice if that were true. That's
[18848.68s -> 18854.20s]  it. Two sixty. You're a rat, aren't you? Giant rat. No, no, why would that happen? That's not
[18854.20s -> 18859.24s]  we're just, we're just people. Police officer too. Man, I'm going to be taking you in then.
[18860.20s -> 18865.96s]  Jerma, you know, wouldn't this be funny if it were real? Haha, just kidding. Be careful. Apparently
[18865.96s -> 18872.36s]  there's a giant rat around. Giant rat. You have a good day, officer. Officer leaves and camera
[18872.36s -> 18879.96s]  falls to the town. Police officer. So, you figure anything out in there? Police officer too. Nah,
[18879.96s -> 18886.68s]  he's clean. It's back to the drawing board. Police officer. Well, that's, that's great. I don't know
[18886.68s -> 18891.66s]  how to draw, so you're going to have to do the drawing. Cat police music starts and the cat police
[18891.66s -> 18898.62s]  arrive. Scratchy scratch. Sergeant Scratchy Scratch of the cat police reporting in. You are now
[18898.62s -> 18903.98s]  relived of your duty. Police officer one and two. Jerma is simultaneous or proving the cat
[18903.98s -> 18910.14s]  police. This is the kind of shit that happens when you have a text to speech enabled stream.
[18910.14s -> 18916.50s]  What's that on you? Police officer two. What? Scratchy scratch. Are you wearing a rat on your
[18916.50s -> 18924.42s]  shoulder? Police officer two. Why would I be wearing a... Hey guys, so, um. Yeah, so I have
[18924.42s -> 18929.14s]  some merch if you want to check out my store. Small rat. Boss, we got big problems. The cat
[18929.14s -> 18934.26s]  police are here. I gotta try to drop these balls into the... Can we try to drop these in here?
[18934.26s -> 18939.06s]  Let's get it. Get us the fuck out of here. Okay. Hey, you drive the car. You gotta get five in each
[18939.06s -> 18944.74s]  bucket. Let's speed it up. Because when you get five in a bucket, it's easier to get 500 tickets.
[18944.74s -> 18951.22s]  Rats. Inaudible screaming and yelling. Scratchy scratch. Good job, cat police. You did it again.
[18951.22s -> 18955.54s]  You saved the world and that's what we do as cat police. We make the world a better place.
[18956.58s -> 18960.74s]  Camera cuts to space where earth blows up in a ufo with a cat head is nearby.
[18961.70s -> 18968.66s]  Credits to Jerma985 for the video. Movie idea in all concepts. Script was typed up completely
[18968.66s -> 18977.62s]  by me with edits from the community. We really are getting an NPR outro. That's an NPR outro.
[18977.62s -> 19004.76s]  Is it over? Okay, it's over. How many tickets? 37,000 tickets. Let me just put these in.
[19006.04s -> 19011.10s]  This is less efficient than the... I had to get away from the co-op for a minute.
[19019.00s -> 19021.88s]  God. I'm doing this one at like times 10 speed.
[19022.68s -> 19035.75s]  This is no... Why would somebody do this? This one is actually going to be as fast as I can make it.
[19041.56s -> 19046.04s]  I'm not suffering through this for long. Rats. Rats. We're the rats. What? We pray at night.
[19046.04s -> 19049.48s]  We stalk at night. We're the rats. No, that's not... I'm that giant rat that makes all of the rules.
[19050.04s -> 19052.84s]  Rats. Let's see what kind of trouble we can get ourselves into. That's not as close to being...
[19052.84s -> 19054.52s]  So sue me for being thorough. I want to know that you know what the plan is.
[19055.40s -> 19075.64s]  Stop. Okay. You're not getting... I'm not going to slow this one down.
[19076.52s -> 19098.89s]  Here you go. You've reached the 20 minute daily limit for voices. Oh god damn it. That means I
[19098.89s -> 19105.13s]  have to do David. Hello ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to episode one of Jermacraft, the series
[19105.13s -> 19108.95s]  where I play Minecraft. This is going to be a single player let's play and when I say let's play,
[19108.95s -> 19111.67s]  I use that term pretty loosely because I'm an idiot in this game. You're gonna see lots of fails.
[19112.55s -> 19116.79s]  You're gonna see lots of triumphs, at least I'm hoping. So go grab yourself a nice hot cup of
[19116.79s -> 19121.19s]  coffee, hot cup of cocoa. I've got apple cider right here freshly brewed. Let me take a sip.
[19122.15s -> 19125.35s]  Sip off. That's good cider. All right, so let's get this started. Create new world.
[19126.23s -> 19131.35s]  World name is going to be Jermacraft. Sounds about right. Yeah okay. Game mode is going to be
[19131.35s -> 19135.67s]  Super AI Survival. That's the most interesting I think. More world option C for world generator.
[19135.67s -> 19139.51s]  Okay this is important. I got named as something crazy to get cool structures and stuff.
[19140.41s -> 19145.62s]  Gonna name it umm how about. Diamonds are forever lol cheese. Alverga dot all right.
[19145.62s -> 19148.82s]  There's that's our world generator seed. Diamonds are forever lol cheese b-u-r-g-a-h done.

[19153.86s -> 19157.78s]  this is so exciting. This is episode one. I wonder. I wonder where we're gonna end up. Where are we
[19157.78s -> 19163.94s]  gonna end up? Okay what what? Where the hell am I? I spawned on top of a mountain top. Okay hold on.
[19163.94s -> 19168.34s]  Sound has to be lowered. Definitely. Okay a little bit of that. A little bit of that. Maybe a
[19168.34s -> 19174.18s]  little lower. That sounds about right. All right. So uh apparently I spawned on top of a mountain.
[19174.18s -> 19179.56s]  I kinda this is a good seed. What's that? We're going to explore it right now go. Dies from fall
[19179.56s -> 19185.05s]  damage oh. Jerma laugh. All right we're going to try that again. This time I'm not gonna miss. I

[19257.91s -> 19260.95s]  damage how well at least there's one tree over here try to remember I gotta go back that way
[19260.95s -> 19265.27s]  because that's where the house is gonna be my awesome dirt house so if you are an old subscriber
[19265.27s -> 19269.91s]  I mean really old like at least four months ol on 44 or five months you'll remember the original
[19269.91s -> 19274.33s]  germacraft it was like two episodes and I built a dirt house this is gonna be completely different
[19274.33s -> 19276.97s]  I'm going to actually spend time and make some cool stuff at least that's what I'm pretending
[19276.97s -> 19282.09s]  that I'm gonna say that got some wood I got Gino still it's Minecraft skin from Mario RPG one of
[19282.09s -> 19287.45s]  the best games of all time if you have never played Mario RPG I suggest you play it all right

[19292.89s -> 19298.79s]  wood punching more wood punching so I guess they added a hunger feature now too if you're hungry
[19298.79s -> 19304.46s]  you die or something I guess who knows even more wood punching a little bit more wood and in my
[19304.46s -> 19307.42s]  live streams I was always a tradition that when I played this game I would sing a song when things
[19307.42s -> 19312.46s]  got really boring opportunity right now to sing a song so I'll let me just prep my vocal chords
[19312.46s -> 19316.70s]  for a second six apple cider clears throat okay so we're getting wood right now right

[19377.56s -> 19381.96s]  this up a little bit 2011 why don't we huh yeah all right all right maybe put a little bit of
[19381.96s -> 19386.82s]  dirt down here make sure I can you know D did I really run out of dirt wonderful my first wooden
[19386.82s -> 19391.45s]  tools it's just like going to your first day of school and get punched in the face by the bully
[19391.45s -> 19395.45s]  what speaking of bullies I got a funny story for you first ever story on German crap
[19396.41s -> 19400.41s]  while I do this mundane stuff so when I was like in the fourth grade I was a kid that lived down
[19400.41s -> 19404.41s]  the street from me his name will stay anonymous because you know I don't want him to like if he
[19404.41s -> 19408.58s]  watches these videos I don't want him to come like feed me up not that he would ever remember
[19408.58s -> 19412.33s]  this to begin with but I was probably like the fourth grade and it swallows I was a little s
[19412.33s -> 19415.90s]  word guys I was a little I was a little little jerk when I was younger so essentially what
[19415.90s -> 19421.56s]  happened was this kid he was a big big fat kid scary not very nice and my brother got in like
[19421.56s -> 19424.36s]  a fight with him like a little time before this V when I was like the second grade my brother's
[19424.36s -> 19428.31s]  a little bit older than me and let me pick this up so my brother got in a fight with this kid and
[19428.31s -> 19432.44s]  like I heard about it and so at the bus stop one day because we were at the same bus stop because
[19432.44s -> 19436.68s]  he lives right down the street from us at least at least he did I don't know if he does anymore
[19436.68s -> 19441.19s]  so I'd know why I was in the fourth grade this so much of a little jerk I was so my grandmother
[19441.19s -> 19445.26s]  used to pick me up from school after I got from the bus stop because you know obviously you don't
[19445.26s -> 19448.22s]  want to walk you know the mile and a half back to your house or whatever it is mile cause the
[19448.22s -> 19452.71s]  bus stop wasn't that close so my grandma used to pick me up and he was at the bus stop as well
[19452.71s -> 19456.62s]  and one day I decided that out of the back window I was going to give him a double middle finger
[19456.62s -> 19460.54s]  as I was driving with my grandmother one day I'd know why I don't even know why I did it guys I
[19460.54s -> 19464.70s]  can't I can't tell you one reason why I gave this kid double middle finger this is a real story
[19464.70s -> 19469.48s]  he just kind of gave me the w like a weird look like what I did I actually did this and from that
[19469.48s -> 19473.78s]  day forward I would run run as fast as I could to the bus stop and wait to the bus stop where
[19473.78s -> 19477.78s]  my grandmother was gonna pick me up and it was like that for almost six months yeah and he never
[19477.78s -> 19482.57s]  beat me up or anything like that he and he I don't I don't I was like overreacting actually
[19482.57s -> 19487.29s]  hold on a second I don't need this what am I doing with this I was just putting blocks down
[19487.29s -> 19491.77s]  actually no no no I was I was doing the right thing I want I want these cause I want to make
[19491.77s -> 19496.79s]  like a wall kind of let's keep that going so yeah so I guess the moral of the story is never give
[19496.79s -> 19499.35s]  a double middle finger to a bully dot cause you'll be scared for the rest of your life
[19500.38s -> 19503.90s]  and I still am scared when I like open my doors to like go and get the groceries I'm scared
[19503.90s -> 19508.46s]  that bully's gonna come get me for me giving him the bird yeah that is actually a true story
[19508.46s -> 19512.28s]  I did not make that up it I was scared for like at least six months and nothing ever
[19512.28s -> 19516.90s]  happened either and like like I didn't get beat up or anything so all right now is there is this
[19516.90s -> 19529.90s]  all is this going to be down in okay cool we finally give drugs to robots in this game when
[19529.90s -> 19534.84s]  people are watching I really don't think it's happened ambient cave sound is that oh there's

[21168.71s -> 21174.07s]  it yourself then well here's the thing the reason why I'm not doing it myself is because when I get
[21174.07s -> 21182.15s]  five times two three times everybody calls me stupid idiot dumb moron so I'm letting you guys
[21182.15s -> 21215.42s]  seal the fate here bottom right let's do it better better okay keep it up better closer warmer
[21222.25s -> 21243.43s]  got middle or in the corner which one is it gonna be it's looking like the corner give it 10 seconds

[21293.43s -> 21307.42s]  on the one on the that was very clear I did it twice 20 times three is so important here
[21307.42s -> 21319.80s]  because that will probably be like 20 000 tickets holy shit everybody wants to go right in the middle
[21319.80s -> 21325.96s]  is that right in the middle well it looks kind of split it's definitely the top in the middle
[21325.96s -> 21354.06s]  area is that in the right spot 15 not bad not bad guys there's no more fives and we're good
[21354.06s -> 21384.87s]  there's no more fives oh 32 versus 49 down the middle this is that shitty suitcase deal show
[21384.87s -> 21395.93s]  oh yeah do or don't all right we're going right in the middle underneath 15
[21403.54s -> 21415.00s]  god damn it guys it's times two this shit's times two
[21436.79s -> 21441.61s]  cards are dropping though all right hold on a minute cards are dropping
[21441.61s -> 21459.21s]  I wonder if those are worth anything we don't deserve to lose okay hold on uh cards have been
[21459.21s -> 21476.55s]  dropping so hold on we lost because of your shitty computer that's not fair all right let me see
[21476.55s -> 21486.15s]  let me collect the uh the stuff my shitty computer and what if it was your computer that did it
[21489.08s -> 21512.09s]  we can do that again not one of these is lit up give me the fucking dunks I'm gonna pick
[21512.09s -> 21524.50s]  next time to get that again bonus see what's that card see that card right there that lawn care what
[21524.50s -> 21533.11s]  does it say the other machine has more I'll go to the other machine after I do this one last final
[21533.11s -> 21543.37s]  I want to get that whatever that card is see this one dropping right here too what what are those
[21543.37s -> 21564.39s]  cards come on don't go my turn it's my turn it's my turn I'm gonna do it my turn 15 right off the

[21620.90s -> 21637.70s]  so what just fell out what was that what does it do stuff up this right side is it tickets
[21657.48s -> 21661.32s]  it's probably tickets okay there it goes down then it just disappears
[21662.54s -> 21664.86s]  is it just turn maybe it's just turning into the tickets
[21667.58s -> 21672.44s]  1300 61 all right we gotta get we gotta get the d
[21684.06s -> 21702.98s]  there it is bonus what's the goal here I need to get to a hundred thousand tickets it was supposed
[21702.98s -> 21708.90s]  to take 22 minutes but I got too distracted by the spongebob episodes transcript and it derailed
[21708.90s -> 21725.48s]  the whole spring let me just try to get the bonus one more time if you get 20 spins at times three
[21725.48s -> 21736.42s]  that's like 10 000 tickets or even 15 at times three still haven't gone to the ufo arcade
[21737.30s -> 21741.48s]  didn't I try to go to the ufo door and it didn't open I thought I tried to do that already
[21743.50s -> 21769.26s]  that just not happened almost just got an instant spin it's pretty rare that that happens so wait
[21769.74s -> 21778.57s]  could I I tried to go in the ufo are you sure that is currently not part of like the early
[21778.57s -> 21781.77s]  access or something and eventually we'll have an arcade or is there an actual arcade in there
[21782.49s -> 21811.27s]  that I didn't see whatever let me get these two cards down and then sit there they go nice
[21811.91s -> 21816.63s]  all right that felt pretty good and we already got like one more donko like

[22248.68s -> 22255.48s]  efficient because eventually you'll get to a thousand you know I'm saying like I'm getting
[22255.48s -> 22261.40s]  500 800 400 500 every time and I and I'm then you will get 2000 if you sit here long enough
[22265.82s -> 22275.18s]  I fuck it up every damn time the ball claw machine is the best I sat there for like
[22275.18s -> 22279.98s]  40 minutes I need to do another a different game that's not the balloons
[22286.31s -> 22291.67s]  it is really loud I know it is oh my god I fucking missed it again

[22330.39s -> 22336.18s]  America runs on dunco yes it does
[22336.98s -> 22362.84s]  okay 500 right here 500 oh I'll get it just teleported it was bullshit just teleported
[22364.52s -> 22377.86s]  all right I'll take the 2120 let's go cashman that's I think that's a solid like five eight
[22377.86s -> 22391.78s]  percent we're at 50% I'm just gonna now I'm gonna do the boring ball game no I'm not I'm gonna do
[22391.78s -> 22409.66s]  this do this until I don't do it got it oh I was I actually really did get it
[22418.30s -> 22429.22s]  I really I did I really did I think she looks like iPods in these it's gonna be close
[22438.60s -> 22442.28s]  this one's also way too expensive I don't want to do the money machine thing again
[22449.61s -> 22454.65s]  there it is all right that was perfect I refuse to play this again
[22455.45s -> 22464.31s]  oh I tried to get out but it I did the screen didn't even pop up for me
[22486.46s -> 22503.96s]  all right here we go here I am let's go figure out the ticket balls this one's broken it used
[22503.96s -> 22522.73s]  to work really well I need to get 100 500 balls do you understand the thing that you are telling
[22522.73s -> 22550.26s]  me that I need to do and how I don't want to do it stop spinning around so much no spongebob
[22550.82s -> 22556.20s]  no there's only a certain amount of spongebob that I'm allowed to take
[22558.54s -> 22574.20s]  17-hour stream no I'll get there quicker than that I think dunko might be a better bet I really do
[22575.72s -> 22587.30s]  I just got an achievement for getting 50 000 tickets all right I'm gonna I'll get let's do this
[22590.12s -> 22613.37s]  20 more times yeah back to the claw and then sometimes the claw just doesn't work
[22614.33s -> 22628.94s]  oh I'm a chicken wheel that's a good idea too what was the minor prize for the blocks game again
[22628.94s -> 22645.91s]  was it a thousand it was wasn't it it was 100 oh that's not worth it go back to the water gun
[22645.91s -> 22663.00s]  game now the water gun game doesn't give uh it gives credits it doesn't give tickets what time
[22663.00s -> 22669.42s]  is it right now I've had like two streams or three streams restart because of the internet being
[22669.42s -> 22676.30s]  weird earlier this is four and a half hours then two hours how long has this stream actually been
[22681.78s -> 22685.46s]  that's next level play right there and it didn't even go in it just teleported back to the
[22686.66s -> 22701.08s]  that's absolute dog shit it's been about seven hours well it's kept my attention for seven
[22701.08s -> 22706.79s]  hours somehow I don't know it's just like fun to do these things all right let me go and check
[22706.79s -> 22717.30s]  let's go I'm gonna go after one more ball and I'm gonna go to chicken game there we go come on get
[22717.30s -> 22727.66s]  it in there does that even is it counting I don't think that's fucking counting
[22741.83s -> 22757.64s]  almost there we're mostly there now don't you understand no that's just that's just cuckoo coins
[22767.91s -> 22780.41s]  bonus shot so if you do twice in a row you get 2,500 that's all the way up there is too hard
[22794.74s -> 22801.54s]  this one sucks it's fun to play but it's not it's bad it's not going to get us another 48,000 tokens
[22801.54s -> 22828.66s]  the 2,500 is 75 it's definitely 25 what we'll just go for red how many times do I have to do
[22828.66s -> 22852.98s]  that if I just landed on red 500 times 500 more times the ball drop game is actually pretty good
[22852.98s -> 22867.06s]  it's pretty consistent too all right I'm gonna do this I'm not gonna do this again I'm not gonna
[22867.06s -> 22872.65s]  put everybody through this a second time I'm gonna get like three or four hundred more tickets from
[22872.65s -> 22883.93s]  this game there's always that chance that I get all right here we go this is the shot right here
[22884.49s -> 22891.43s]  I'll take a hundred it's all right that's about well I'm looking like two or three more of these
[22898.54s -> 22923.70s]  get it oh what that would have been 2,500 too much I would have had it too all right so let's play a

[24500.81s -> 24549.83s]  okay six I was doing six there he's being toxic again and away we go this one's really easy
[24553.98s -> 24558.30s]  you know here here's the thing I'm never gonna have to play any of these ever again in the
[24558.30s -> 24564.52s]  arcade I am getting my total fill from these games that I will walk right by them I don't
[24564.52s -> 24574.78s]  have to go to the arcade again I've seen this machine in a dozen arcades I don't even need to
[24574.78s -> 24583.21s]  play it who fucking cares I already did it like 50 times and neither do you unless you want to
[24583.21s -> 24601.72s]  try to show me up yeah fucking retweet this video if you think that you could beat me
[24603.19s -> 24626.20s]  right guys oh it's all right I still I got like 223 000 last one and then I'm gonna go back over
[24626.20s -> 24630.20s]  to I don't know I need that in the basket I'll get a thousand in the basket and win
[24640.86s -> 24643.05s]  basketball doesn't give tickets
[24645.61s -> 24647.91s]  this is absolutely
[24659.67s -> 24662.20s]  I'll settle for 100
[24662.20s -> 24663.40s]  uh
[24672.23s -> 24682.50s]  it's the worst machine in any arcade now riddle me this why are these machines always
[24683.14s -> 24689.53s]  full of people there is always somebody playing one of these there's just at least
[24689.53s -> 24692.41s]  five of them lined up and every single one of them has a person on it
[24699.02s -> 24703.90s]  low skill high reward no it's low skill low reward you get like 10 tickets every time and
[24703.90s -> 24714.39s]  it's like four bucks this is the worst machine in the art again I don't talk about companies
[24734.98s -> 24742.39s]  scared me I'm in my own world so much that this person scared the shit out of me
[24743.11s -> 24744.33s]  oh
[24755.32s -> 24763.96s]  no statistically speaking there's no way it's not gonna happen guys it's not
[24767.72s -> 24775.48s]  there's nothing to this besides land on one one percent of the whole wheel
[24776.04s -> 24788.34s]  if I don't get this you're gonna unsew what if I do get this
[24791.05s -> 24795.21s]  should I prices right this and try to get it on 1000 and do like a one tiny little spin
[24798.73s -> 24803.30s]  let's try this let's try doing the prices right technique
[24821.77s -> 24839.54s]  it's gonna work I'm gonna get there and then I'm going to farm 1000 tickets stop stop stop stop
[24839.54s -> 24899.90s]  stop it's so diabolical I love it I'll get there slowly but surely yeah what do you mean zero
[24899.90s -> 24941.26s]  tickets oh fuck it actually went over it come on man you have to go one space all right I
[24941.26s -> 24949.48s]  understand so you have to at least go over one square so as long as I get to the yeah it was
[24949.48s -> 24964.06s]  landing on the same one it was actually working then yeah make sure the tickets are actually
[24964.06s -> 24973.83s]  coming out give me the hundred hundred uh will it still count as a hundred if I go if I get on the
[24973.83s -> 24998.04s]  hundred no I don't think so let me at least hit it just so I can go to sleep oh come on evil fish
[24998.04s -> 25006.22s]  just gave five community subs thank you evil fish lots of community subs tonight big subs
[25008.12s -> 25028.07s]  it works it works I did it oh 100 tickets now can I do it again nope I can do it I can get
[25028.07s -> 25041.45s]  through those it actually would have worked all right now we know it works I gotta go a little
[25041.45s -> 25057.00s]  faster than that that actually did give me the four still all right it's coming up here right
[25057.96s -> 25066.50s]  what is it the next one when is it it's still less efficient than the ball drop no I know but
[25066.50s -> 25072.66s]  I just I have to I have to beat this I have to get a thousand to come out of the machine therefore
[25072.66s -> 25090.44s]  I can say that I completed it here it comes okay stop all right little pushes
[25096.73s -> 25103.08s]  somebody said if you land on a thousand and then do a full pull it'll land on a thousand
[25104.18s -> 25120.46s]  not well is that real so get to a thousand and then land do full speed
[25125.02s -> 25133.13s]  what do I have to lose you're right why do you read chat comments like a radio host
[25135.88s -> 25149.02s]  because that's what this is I'm how is this any different what this is this is a radio show
[25150.49s -> 25169.29s]  why would I not read the comments you want to look over and go
[25175.99s -> 25181.29s]  nice dude and that and that's what I deserve for fucking oh my god
[25186.81s -> 25234.04s]  that's a funny thing you said dude land on it organically come on back there again
[25234.04s -> 25252.62s]  do that one more time and then uh here it is all right okay all right fuck okay I
[25253.02s -> 25272.02s]  ha ha ha yeah you have to do it so light uh I'm gonna turn the audio off I'm gonna
[25272.02s -> 25285.59s]  people it's freaking me out I just pulled my headphones off because there's no way I can't
[25285.59s -> 25328.98s]  that what a sad person how much money is that old guy spent on the machine I don't know
[25329.78s -> 25351.46s]  at least $400 I'm just leaning back in the chair I pulled up a chair by this point
[25351.46s -> 25354.98s]  it's still ringing in my head yeah like this
[25364.44s -> 25382.20s]  I almost just accidentally pressed it a tenth of a percent harder almost there hey thank you
[25382.20s -> 25392.17s]  demons V for the five community subs thanks a lot my new sub sound thank you for the that's my new
[25392.17s -> 25403.37s]  community sub sound appreciate it hope you guys like it every time I get a community sub that
[25403.37s -> 25425.02s]  song will play all right I gotta be careful it's a sneaky way of asking the subs hey look at that
[25429.53s -> 25444.82s]  is it sneaky or is it just like completely and totally like just out there I'm not gonna make
[25444.82s -> 25463.53s]  that the sub sound no way this hurts so much to watch it won't be in a minute I promise
[25465.10s -> 25469.80s]  we're almost there it's almost done and then I'm gonna do I'm gonna get on a thousand I'm gonna
[25469.80s -> 25493.58s]  full blast it speaking of sub sounds are they actually basically dead kind of kind of all right
[25493.58s -> 25521.40s]  here we go what's happening okay ready two more of those I think you're freaking me out
[25521.40s -> 25559.38s]  no um there's no overshoot joke you're freaking me out stop freaking me out fuck yes a thousand
[25559.38s -> 25602.90s]  tickets all right so they said do a full blast from here you lied well what do you mean I held
[25602.90s -> 25625.21s]  it down I actually held it down I swear to god stop oh all right I'm out I was trying to get it
[25625.21s -> 25668.18s]  just trying to hit it one more time sometimes you gotta try oh where am I let's see 61 000 all right
[25668.18s -> 25709.90s]  back to this I want to let me hit this at least one more time I think that's pretty good
[25711.35s -> 25725.14s]  no no no it was it looked all right it's all right um uh the treasure game I'll try it it's
[25725.14s -> 25731.74s]  gonna that's I don't know how I don't understand how this works you joystick to move arm and knock
[25731.74s -> 25739.99s]  off coins don't touch the shovel so how what's I can't even read if there's a thousand tickets
[25739.99s -> 25777.34s]  if you get to what I've knocked all the uh all the shit off the sound yeah I'm gonna turn this boy
[25777.34s -> 25788.22s]  down this is obnoxious I'm still not getting it do you have to get all the coins knocked off
[25788.86s -> 25824.46s]  I still don't get it the coins have to go forward is that what it is the front doesn't count I
[25824.46s -> 25833.66s]  thought the front is the thing that counts does anybody get what the hell this is actually going
[25833.66s -> 25891.64s]  on here I mean damn man like how the fuck are you supposed to do this front doesn't count how did
[25891.64s -> 25923.21s]  I only get five coins oh now those are definitely counting go left and right starting in the middle
[25923.21s -> 25929.03s]  is a bad strategy you talk about just like sweep left and right let's try this let's try just
[25929.03s -> 25976.70s]  sweeping up here like going like this that's too thin um this this one's stupid that's what I was
[25976.70s -> 25988.18s]  thinking I was thinking going around like a swirl like this this probably is the way you're supposed
[25988.18s -> 26008.89s]  to do it just break the glass I need to I need to figure this out how the hell are you supposed to
[26009.45s -> 26041.21s]  try doing a square around the perimeter not a bad idea so far it's just hard to grab them all
[26041.21s -> 26051.62s]  especially because you keep um I really hope this is not in any arcades because I feel bad
[26051.62s -> 26088.38s]  for the company that made it because no one plays it no I just I do get the treasure off
[26088.38s -> 26104.41s]  I can't even go back far enough to get it I'm not done let me try let me try one more time
[26104.41s -> 26118.44s]  I'm just gonna go back and then forward with all like the big chunk parts like that okay
[26119.24s -> 26136.33s]  there's not enough time to do this I even knocked off all the treasure chests
[26139.51s -> 26154.89s]  what the fuck I'm off doing it this last one I'm gonna try like an undulating technique
[26177.69s -> 26224.47s]  that might actually work that might actually work what the fuck that was fucking perfect
[26224.47s -> 26256.31s]  oh all right that's a hundred how many do you need I'm gonna try that again oh yeah that was
[26256.31s -> 26263.66s]  that was why was it 50 tickets all right last this one's dumb who cares I don't need to get
[26263.66s -> 26288.73s]  the thousand thousand that's a pretty good push right there that was a lot pretty good push again
[26288.73s -> 26311.16s]  come on man what oh all right come on last one that's it I'm going right down the middle
[26311.16s -> 26313.88s]  check this out right down the middle on this side right down the middle the other side
[26319.10s -> 26334.14s]  I fucked it up the game's like lagged did you see that shit the game lagged I need another
[26334.14s -> 26372.79s]  attempt without the lag that was clean I was just throw up why can I move the mouse in here
[26372.79s -> 26417.77s]  why can I move this just lock me in just out I'm out this one's dumb what happened there that
[26417.77s -> 26426.52s]  was so different are we doing the skit again yeah yeah man this is the just this is the skit again
[26426.52s -> 26451.48s]  this is the joke again that's what I'm doing here and now that thing is stuck back there
[26451.48s -> 26500.14s]  this game isn't even real because if it was real they would suck that's a pretty good attempt right
[26500.14s -> 26531.35s]  there give me a hundred a hundred whatever I'm pissed right now I just threw this one away
[26531.83s -> 26541.08s]  just get it out I don't want to play this one anymore where's like the put foot through glass
[26541.08s -> 26587.61s]  button this game's stupid dumb the game eats ass I have one cent right by the bat at the prize
[26587.61s -> 26611.69s]  counter look at that I'm so close why did I move from the spot this has been a very long birthday
[26611.69s -> 26626.44s]  party excuse me please move why don't you get in there they always do the same thing they always
[26626.52s -> 26643.00s]  stick themselves into the door all right what I need some efficiency here there's five community
[26643.00s -> 26650.68s]  subs from an anonymous gifter thank you whoever you are thank you for your five community subs
[26652.97s -> 26660.10s]  500 good all right we're good here we go go go go this one's pretty consistent I think I'll be

[26682.71s -> 26693.40s]  hundred that comes to see bingo almost it's all right I get at least three to four hundred tickets
[26693.40s -> 26705.78s]  every single time I play this and then you I'm gonna be good that was bullshit he's still on
[26705.78s -> 26719.37s]  the hockey game after this much time time guys I don't think I'm gonna get to the hundred thousand
[26719.37s -> 26725.42s]  tickets I'm already kind of failing right now my like my brain is starting to start fail
[26725.42s -> 26754.76s]  just grind out some green balls I will after this oh my god thanks for watching though thanks
[26754.76s -> 26760.95s]  for sticking around hope you had fun we're gonna have a ton of fun when I get that boom box

[32928.73s -> 32937.45s]  let's get them on the screen why not why not right these are going to get cut off unfortunately
[32937.45s -> 32941.69s]  because of and look look at how fast these are going and the first like two hours of them have
[32941.69s -> 32948.01s]  been caught up annoying because this has happened the last few streams uh somehow for some reason
[32948.01s -> 32955.22s]  and i don't know why this is new usually we drop a shitload of frames or the internet will cut will
[32955.22s -> 32963.38s]  turn off but what's been happening recently is this weird stream completely just disconnects 100
[32963.38s -> 32970.70s]  and i'm still on the internet that happened once tonight and this weird like going to zero and
[32970.70s -> 32977.99s]  coming back but like the internet's not completely off i feel like the second time was not even a
[32977.99s -> 32983.67s]  cox problem the first time i think was because the house's internet was off but the second time
[32983.67s -> 32990.10s]  i was still online i was talking in chat this is a new problem we're not dropping a shitload of
[32990.18s -> 32999.74s]  frames anymore the stream's just turning off which is arguably worse so they're scheduled to come and
[32999.74s -> 33005.91s]  do some maintenance here some real maintenance that has been planned for months apparently so
[33005.91s -> 33016.01s]  we'll see if that helps frames are still dropping yeah but looking over here there were 4,600 frames
[33016.09s -> 33022.98s]  dropped a 4,664 in almost seven and a half hours that's pretty normal even if you have
[33023.94s -> 33029.06s]  perfect internet you're always going to drop over the course of six to eight hours on a stream
[33029.06s -> 33038.15s]  you'll drop like at least two to four thousand frames it'll happen but thank you to all the
[33038.15s -> 33046.02s]  subs everybody that's resubbing continue to resub all the gift subs you keep this channel fucking
[33046.02s -> 33052.58s]  chugging along so thank you guys and then some and then some so thank you everybody
[33053.38s -> 33058.02s]  and you're gonna let us know when the carnival stream is happening beforehand oh yeah
[33059.06s -> 33065.94s]  once i have a date for that i'm gonna be hyping it up like crazy at least a month in advance like
[33065.94s -> 33070.74s]  two or three weeks in advance at least you will know when that day is i'm gonna have a pinned
[33070.74s -> 33079.22s]  tweet about it i will have at least three or four streams over the course of a month where we talk
[33079.22s -> 33085.54s]  about it they i'll make sure it's on the discord as a pin message i'll make sure that it gets on
[33085.54s -> 33091.06s]  the reddit as a pinned message so you'll be able to find it there'll be a command that's right i'll
[33091.06s -> 33096.74s]  make a command for it i'm gonna make the i this this stream is gonna cost a lot of money and a
[33096.74s -> 33100.98s]  lot of people are gonna be working on this so i want to make sure as many people that want to see
[33100.98s -> 33107.22s]  it that want to have fun and enjoy it are here so i'm gonna make sure it's in every single avenue
[33108.18s -> 33122.42s]  but i will give those details when they come i don't want to talk it up like crazy until i
[33122.42s -> 33130.26s]  have a real date which should be i mean i have i literally i'm going tomorrow um i have a meeting
[33130.26s -> 33136.26s]  with uh the person that's producing the whole thing so i'm sure i'll have some more hard data
[33136.26s -> 33147.10s]  tomorrow as well we will continue to discuss it don't worry you will know uh one one two one one
[33147.18s -> 33151.02s]  one two e thanks in three bucks hey germa yesterday was my birthday do you eat ass
[33151.74s -> 33159.35s]  a happy birthday happy birthday one one one two thank you to demons v for the three dollars and
[33159.35s -> 33163.03s]  33 cents really appreciate when streamers don't yell i like to zone out a bit while i watch
[33167.03s -> 33180.84s]  i'm a yeller i'm a screamer i'm a noisemaker it happens sometimes hopefully you're not asleep
[33183.00s -> 33187.16s]  thank you yes is online for the five dollars i'm very drunk right now but thanks for showing my
[33187.16s -> 33192.04s]  green screen video when i remixed the shining i couldn't make this in time for the encore night
[33192.04s -> 33211.06s]  so i'm gonna send it through here so for the future green screen videos i think i'm gonna have
[33211.06s -> 33217.42s]  a system where because i know there's a lot of them that have still been made and people are
[33217.42s -> 33225.42s]  still using it and instead of um doing another night i don't think i'm gonna do another uh green
[33225.50s -> 33234.74s]  screen night so what would probably end up happening is i think maybe a channel in the
[33234.74s -> 33243.72s]  discord might be interesting to have uh just a spot for people to put videos and for anybody
[33243.72s -> 33248.20s]  to enjoy them and obviously that discord is moderated so you can't put up any like just
[33249.32s -> 33258.26s]  junk like just crap that's not appropriate you know it's not going to happen but because of how
[33258.26s -> 33266.54s]  many people uh continue to make green screen stuff it might be worth having some other avenue
[33266.54s -> 33270.46s]  like another playlist or something or another channel or something eventually
[33271.90s -> 33288.70s]  let me get this loaded and but uh we have uh 250 from uh sniff thanks uh when's the next anime
[33288.70s -> 33295.94s]  stream because i'm not i don't just i don't plan anime streams it's just if the game is good and

[33302.74s -> 33308.55s]  with an anime character on there 50 percent of people think you're just an anime streamer now
[33308.55s -> 33316.89s]  and 50 percent are like oh so happy that you're an anime streamer now can't i just play a video
