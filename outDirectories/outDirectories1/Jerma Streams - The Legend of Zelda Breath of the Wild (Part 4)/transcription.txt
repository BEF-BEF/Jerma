[2.30s -> 7.59s]  I just want to read. No chat. Hold on. No chat.
[7.59s -> 14.07s]  Jerma doesn't hate streaming. He just delays every single stream and talks about retirement every week.
[16.44s -> 25.64s]  That's not fair. No. Hold on a second. The last, the last like five streams, I have reverse delayed.
[25.88s -> 30.52s]  I have started a day or two early. The last, besides this one.
[31.16s -> 37.00s]  Excuse me. There have been at least three or four straight reverse delays as of the last two weeks.
[37.80s -> 41.83s]  Hey, just because you didn't see it doesn't mean it didn't happen, right? Just because you weren't
[41.83s -> 48.33s]  here doesn't mean I didn't do it. So anyways, after today, I'll see you in like 12 days.
[51.48s -> 62.98s]  Why do you have to be, why is it? No. You knew about that October break for a while. That's
[62.98s -> 77.83s]  not a delay. Well, I just pretended it's fine. It's my birthday. What are you doing? I'm crying
[77.91s -> 84.55s]  right now. Dude, he hates streaming. I love streaming. It's like one of my favorite things ever.
[95.50s -> 101.98s]  Anyways, welcome to the promised, promised breath of the wild Sunday stream. I told you I was going
[101.98s -> 107.11s]  to do it and here I am. Well, let's warm up with a little bit of platoon. What do you think?
[108.86s -> 133.62s]  I'm kidding. Relax. I'm kidding. Today's the last day of Overwatch one. Um, oh, but all right. Um,
[134.42s -> 139.32s]  when was the last time I even played Overwatch one? It's been a long time.
[139.96s -> 150.07s]  He doesn't even care. I mean, I don't, I don't really play Overwatch. Should I play Overwatch
[150.07s -> 157.24s]  too? I mean, I'm sure I'll play it. I don't know if I'll stream it. Should I stream it? Take for a
[157.24s -> 189.43s]  day? No, you won't. That's a lot of no's. That's a lot of no's. Adding PVE. I mean, is it as good as
[189.43s -> 215.70s]  the Splatoon PVE? That's my question. No, thanks. We're good. You know what? I really hope Diablo
[215.70s -> 222.57s]  four is good. You know what I mean? Like I, I hope like I've been there. I look, I'm a Diablo Andy.
[223.93s -> 231.11s]  I really like Diablo is like, okay. Cause I hated Diablo immortal. It was like, I fucking despised
[231.11s -> 236.90s]  it. I hated every second of it. It's, it might, it might be all right, right? It looks Diablo four
[236.90s -> 256.12s]  looks okay from the things I've seen about it. I hope so. I hope so for your sake. No,
[257.24s -> 266.07s]  it's all right. I will remember my fondness in Diablo two and Reaper Diablo three Reaper was,
[266.07s -> 272.31s]  was good. They made a lot of good changes. It's okay. Diablo three Reaper launch like the first
[272.31s -> 277.35s]  three or four months of that game. I thought were great, but then I didn't really like the subsequent
[277.35s -> 283.10s]  patches. I think they did a pretty good job trying to get it back to, uh, back to life.
[290.15s -> 294.46s]  Didn't all right, correct me if I'm wrong. So I want to be corrected if I'm wrong,
[294.46s -> 297.02s]  cause I, if I'm incorrect, I want people to say that's not correct.
[298.15s -> 310.47s]  The, did the game director for Reaper of souls end up leaving Blizzard because that's, is that
[310.47s -> 315.99s]  incorrect? That's not correct. That's correct. That's not correct. Great. Thanks for the help.
[320.44s -> 338.01s]  I love how somebody wrote probably. Let me, I'm just going to look it up because you guys
[338.01s -> 361.54s]  aren't helpful. Let me see. Reaper of souls director. Hold on. Hold on. All right. Yeah,
[361.54s -> 374.39s]  he's gone. He left Blizzard, uh, in July of 2016. Well, I mean, isn't that one of the reasons why
[374.39s -> 386.23s]  that was the game was better? I don't know. It was my fault. What did I do? Well, okay. My point is
[386.79s -> 393.03s]  in my opinion, the, the, the guy that made Diablo through Diablo through the guy that made Diablo
[393.03s -> 396.79s]  three, a better game. And obviously there's tons of other people that worked on it, right?
[397.51s -> 403.35s]  But I would have liked to see that person come back to D four. I don't know. I don't know the
[403.35s -> 413.86s]  story. I have no idea, but I hope it's good. Look, I was overwatch one fun. I thought it was kind of
[413.86s -> 418.42s]  fun for the first like six months. I just didn't care as much as I did about like something like
[418.42s -> 423.93s]  TF2. It just didn't have the staying power that TF2 had. And obviously, very obviously, I mean,
[423.93s -> 430.12s]  you go back to my old YouTube channel that it was like a, wow, here we go. Lizards making like a,
[430.12s -> 438.02s]  a potential kind of FPS arcade TF2 like game. It was a big deal at the time, but it just,
[438.02s -> 445.45s]  it didn't keep me. It just didn't. I did have fun with it though. I, I'm not going to lie. The
[445.45s -> 454.49s]  first six months of that were really fun. It was pretty fog before all the balancing. I thought
[454.49s -> 468.79s]  it was fun. We'll see. Anyways, somebody said, stop stalling. Um, ban that person for life.
[485.94s -> 494.10s]  Hide that guy. Hide him. Wait, I'm sick. I don't want to. What? All right. Well, you get to stay.
[502.63s -> 510.26s]  Please eat sushi. Why? That's a weird request. Do I like sushi? Yeah. I think it's good.
[511.42s -> 521.85s]  Why do you want me to eat it? Why do you want me to eat sushi? Why do a sushi tier list?
[522.41s -> 526.74s]  Okay. I'll do it right now. I don't even need it on the screen. Uh, spicy tuna roll S tier
[528.62s -> 540.06s]  salmon roll B, A, everything else F spicy tuna roll S tier, pretty much everything else F.
[540.78s -> 555.64s]  I'm not a huge sushi fan. Okay. I'm one of those people that will eat sushi and pretend like,
[555.64s -> 561.30s]  I think you made a good idea ordering that. What do you want to try it? Oh, it's, um,
[562.10s -> 565.46s]  it's like a yellow fin or whatever, or yellow tail or something, whatever it is.
[566.26s -> 570.98s]  She's like, Oh yeah. And then you eat it and you're like, Oh, all right. Hmm. Okay. Oh,
[574.54s -> 577.42s]  you never want somebody to do. Oh, wow. This is gross. No, I'm not going to say that
[578.70s -> 587.72s]  because it's not, it's just kind of not my thing. I love spicy tuna. I like, uh, what's maybe people
[587.72s -> 594.42s]  might think I'm insane for saying this. This is going to make people probably gag when I say this.
[596.04s -> 599.32s]  Uh, no, it's good though. It's, is it weird for me to say this?
[600.57s -> 606.26s]  I, okay. I like a Philadelphia roll. If you don't know what a Philadelphia roll is,
[607.14s -> 617.59s]  it's salmon, cream cheese, and avocado. I feel like people would think I was gross for saying that,
[618.74s -> 627.27s]  but a lot of you are saying based and wow, good, good, good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's basic. Hold on.
[627.91s -> 635.72s]  Isn't the very nature of like true sushi basic? It's raw fish on rice. Oh, that's the very
[635.72s -> 656.42s]  definition of a base of basic. Basic doesn't mean bad. It's just very, Hey, you got a little bit of
[656.42s -> 665.78s]  raw fish laid on top of some rice. That's it. I'm actually, I'd rather eat that. I'm not into the,
[665.78s -> 672.66s]  um, like Omega volcano roll where the thing comes out and it's like stacked four feet tall.
[677.62s -> 680.66s]  Like, well, you know what I mean? I don't, it's like, Oh yeah, well, this is it. We'll see it's
[680.66s -> 684.82s]  eel. And then there's a, there's like a Szechuan sauce on top of that. And then on top of that is
[684.82s -> 690.58s]  tuna. And then on top, it's like a kebab. I don't, I don't like those. You can't eat them in one bite.
[696.63s -> 701.27s]  Those are sushi kebabs. Those are, I don't, I don't really like, I like eating it in one bite
[701.91s -> 707.67s]  as a Rick and Morty reference. I don't, okay. If that's from this season, I haven't seen it.
[707.67s -> 714.25s]  So it's, it's just, we both thought the same thing was funny. Anyways, let's play.
[714.81s -> 727.96s]  Could you please consider streaming another shitty, I don't want to say the company.
[729.96s -> 734.60s]  I could just say the name of the company, right? Like I'm not, Hey, can you please play the,
[734.60s -> 738.04s]  this game from this shitty company? Like I, I'm like, I don't want to say that out loud.
[744.74s -> 752.20s]  No, no, stop, stop it. Anyways, welcome to the stream. Hope you're having a good Sunday.
[753.16s -> 765.86s]  Yes, this is going to be, I will not be live. I will, I will not be live until I return from
[765.86s -> 783.83s]  my October break. I will not be live. Okay. Okay. I will not be live. Okay. I'll be back.
[790.79s -> 797.21s]  Do a baseball stream rerun. Now I'm going to spend some time with friends, spend some time
[797.21s -> 808.78s]  with some family. I feel like it's pretty overdue, but it's time to play breath of the wild. I've
[808.78s -> 815.90s]  stalled for about, it's been two hours and 45 minutes on the orbit in soon screen. So that
[815.90s -> 819.50s]  person was right. I'm sorry about that. And kind of just chilling for like two hours and two hour,
[819.50s -> 837.67s]  42 minutes to 41. Yeah. I thought we were your family. You guys are my family guy,
[837.67s -> 857.02s]  not my family. Make sure you get it right. Where, where your POG champs. What's that mean?
[857.74s -> 873.21s]  How long is the break going to be? Um, it's probably going to be maybe like eight days.
[875.34s -> 886.02s]  Okay. It will be eight to 10 days after the, um, okay. I'll be back in about eight to 10 days
[886.58s -> 895.58s]  after the last time you see me on, on camera. Okay. Cool. All right. You understand.
[899.10s -> 905.43s]  You're basically dead. I mean, no, like, I mean, like not the last time, whatever.
[908.63s -> 915.62s]  Everybody just be quiet. Breath of the wild. We're going to continue our play through.
[916.62s -> 924.23s]  Uh, I believe it's just this one right here. I just beat the divine, uh, beast, the elephant one.
[924.23s -> 930.23s]  You're wearing the shaggy shirt again. I am clean though. Don't worry. It's just so easy to wear.
[930.55s -> 935.50s]  Like I don't, okay. Just solid colors are just so easy. I don't have to be like, what is this? Oh,
[935.50s -> 945.10s]  it's just green. Green. Easy. Like gray. Blue. Easy. Done. Can you eat a comedy sandwich? What
[945.10s -> 953.69s]  is the comedy sandwich? Oh, right. Okay. I just got, what did I just get? I got this thing.
[953.69s -> 967.22s]  All right. Everyone said, don't use this. The comedy sandwiches is like, I don't know,
[967.22s -> 975.24s]  cream cheese, onions, Tabasco sauce, and like a turkey leg or something, right? It's like,
[975.24s -> 989.77s]  oh ha, it's like a funny sandwich you made. That sounds pretty good. A knuckle sandwich,
[989.77s -> 996.97s]  maybe. Are you going to punch me in the face? Hey, I got a funny sandwich for you. It's right here.
[1001.67s -> 1010.74s]  All right. So where do I want to go? I just, I beat this divine beast. I could go, hold on. Let me
[1011.30s -> 1021.51s]  take a look. What we got? Destroy Ganon. Where's the other, this, this four, right? What area should
[1021.51s -> 1034.82s]  I go to? I mean, the easy, the easy thing is just to kind of go up and over, right? If I went over
[1034.82s -> 1039.66s]  here, then why not just kind of wrap around here? I have this marked for some reason,
[1039.66s -> 1045.48s]  so I'm going to go see why. We'll go to this pin. I think it's a shrine and cool.
[1054.23s -> 1070.50s]  Make a car tier list now. I don't know anything about cars. I mean, like what, like car types
[1070.50s -> 1078.74s]  or car like makers, like Chevy, Ford, Chrysler. What do you mean? Like, oh, truck hatchback. What
[1078.74s -> 1091.02s]  do you mean? All right. How do I get out of here? I think I have to go this way. Yeah. Okay. I'm
[1091.02s -> 1102.60s]  going to go, I've got to go this way. What are these? All right. Wait, why do I have somebody
[1102.60s -> 1112.28s]  stamps on the map? Car companies. I don't know anything about car companies. I don't know
[1112.28s -> 1123.86s]  anything about them. Wait, I have to turn this in, don't I? Here's the picture. This is the one I got.
[1123.86s -> 1136.42s]  What do you think? Yeah, that's pretty damn good. My apologies. That sound was not very dignified,
[1136.42s -> 1142.90s]  was it? Pardon me. I'm all better now. That Lionel. How terrifying. Well, look at this and I
[1142.90s -> 1147.85s]  doubt anyone would get any reckless ideas about visiting Plymouth mountain. Well,
[1147.85s -> 1163.51s]  here's a follow-up to that. He's dead. Send as many people up there as you want. I killed him. Oh,
[1163.51s -> 1181.08s]  shit. Okay. This is part of the Zora set for now. Cool. East Reservoir Lake was created in a
[1181.08s -> 1185.48s]  collaboration between Hylians and the Zora. After East Reservoir Lake was finished, we made Zora
[1185.48s -> 1200.34s]  Greaves as a token of our friendship. Thanks. Cool. You can swim fast. Cool. You think they'll ever
[1200.34s -> 1203.78s]  make like, you know how it's like, oh, we have to have game difficulties. Do you think they'll
[1203.78s -> 1210.36s]  have a game in patient modes where we just kind of use like fallout to zero intelligence dialogue,
[1210.36s -> 1214.10s]  like get through the story and stuff, or just like take these. They're good. Make you swim fast.
[1214.10s -> 1224.98s]  Oh, cool. Thanks. Appreciate it. Like swim fast. You get equip if want. Oh, I get it. I understand
[1224.98s -> 1235.77s]  it. I know what you what you're asking and telling me. I hope not. Do put on caveman communication
[1235.77s -> 1243.90s]  mode. I don't know. Sometimes you're just looking for, did a bubble just come out of my mouth?
[1244.70s -> 1252.79s]  Sometimes you're just looking for you do this by it's kind of I know I'm going to make a wild
[1252.79s -> 1258.06s]  reference, but it kind of reminds me of you just run around the town and wow, pick up every single
[1258.06s -> 1263.26s]  exclamation point, skip everything and just hit M and look where you need to walk to like to the
[1263.26s -> 1269.24s]  quest. That's it. You don't read anything. Guys, I don't even I didn't even know what half of the
[1269.24s -> 1273.88s]  quests were until I got to the point of the map where it was like a circle and said kill that
[1273.88s -> 1281.96s]  thing. I was like, oh, that's what I'm supposed to do here. All right. So I'm I don't think I
[1281.96s -> 1295.22s]  can climb this mountain. Well, it's not raining anymore. I get up here. I'm going to try it like
[1295.22s -> 1302.71s]  I can stand up there. Doesn't everyone do that with every MMO? I mean, probably it's the most
[1302.71s -> 1313.74s]  efficient way to level up. I shouldn't have done that. What an idiot. OK, I definitely can get up
[1313.74s -> 1337.69s]  there. I'm just so I know I can get up there. Start here. God damn it. Hold on. OK, I'm going
[1337.69s -> 1348.65s]  to skip like 30 minutes of walking by doing this. You can go up the waterfall. Oh, wait. Oh, yeah.
[1348.65s -> 1354.36s]  It is right there. It's been like a week. I haven't played in a week. It's been a while. I
[1354.36s -> 1366.62s]  haven't played. Let me see if I can even do this. No, no, no, no, no, no. We're just going to go up
[1366.62s -> 1373.13s]  the waterfall. Watch your skip. No, if you skip, you made a mistake because look, now you skipped
[1373.13s -> 1376.17s]  like 10 minutes and you're like, where am I? What the fuck? I thought he was climbing a wall.
[1376.17s -> 1400.52s]  Don't tell people to do that. OK, where's that waterfall right here? Vod Watchers skip four
[1400.52s -> 1406.74s]  minutes. If you if you're going to skip less than five minutes in this stream, come on. Are
[1407.06s -> 1414.63s]  what are you skipping? Really? Though those of you that are saying Vod Watchers skip two minutes
[1415.91s -> 1420.79s]  are caveman communication difficulty. Andy's like me. I don't want to hear it ever again.
[1421.51s -> 1427.78s]  What I just said, I got question marked and now people are saying skip two minutes,
[1427.78s -> 1433.94s]  skip five minutes, skip 10 minutes. Isn't that what I just was talking about? I wanted to.
[1433.94s -> 1446.33s]  Where's my mode where I just get to get to the parts where I want to see? I'm not going to die,
[1446.33s -> 1454.58s]  right? I have stamina food, don't I? Oh, fuck. Hold on. Hold on. Eat the stamina food.
[1454.66s -> 1489.34s]  Because I'm going to die if I don't skip to the next sorcery stream. There we are.
[1499.24s -> 1502.52s]  You know, I just thought of a funny thing. What if? All right. Now it's over.
[1503.83s -> 1508.31s]  All the Vod Watchers skip all the Vod Watchers skip. What if I opened up sorcery
[1508.31s -> 1514.63s]  and just played it for two minutes? So people that skipped got just absolutely just screwed over,
[1514.63s -> 1520.71s]  right? Like, wait, what? He's playing sorcery. What happened? Whatever. I'm out of here.
[1523.42s -> 1533.56s]  And then that's that's what happens when you skip. And in that two minute stretch of this stream,
[1534.12s -> 1540.97s]  I talk about how Breath of the Wild is like, not for me. Now, I'm not a fan. I'm not a big fan.
[1540.97s -> 1543.69s]  I'm just gonna play sorcery. You know what I mean? So that'll do, you know, that'll teach you to skip
[1543.69s -> 1562.70s]  five minutes and then you just don't watch the rest. Mm hmm. Camera was weird. All right. One,
[1562.70s -> 1577.59s]  two, three, four, five. Moblin guts. Can we just play the game? LOL. Yeah. All right. No,
[1577.59s -> 1582.41s]  I did say that I was today was guaranteed to not be a crack stream. I did say that.
[1582.41s -> 1592.17s]  You are right. That's very accurate. I did say that. Where are my pins? All right. Well,
[1592.17s -> 1610.39s]  I'm going to take this off. Wait, no, I'm not. Why is this pinned? Who did that? OK, so we got one
[1610.39s -> 1635.48s]  here. There is where else you stole that? You stole his organs. OK, any others? Yeah, over there.
[1636.12s -> 1659.88s]  OK, and one over here. Nice shrines. My favorite part. What is that thing? Oh, shit. Look at that
[1659.88s -> 1668.78s]  one. All right. I got to delete the other pins. I don't know what this was, but maybe someone
[1668.78s -> 1679.22s]  will remember. So which one should I go to first? I'm going to say start on the left side, right?
[1679.22s -> 1701.51s]  I don't know. I'm going over there. Go to the tower first. That one. That's the tower right
[1701.51s -> 1711.99s]  there, right? Is there another one? Oh, all right. Bro, I didn't see it. Look, I was looking like
[1711.99s -> 1720.01s]  this. My field of view was this. I'm going like this down. I see I don't. It's not there on my.
[1720.01s -> 1726.26s]  My eyes don't see it. It's no, it's not. It's not blind. Look, do you see a tower? I don't.
[1726.26s -> 1732.26s]  There's no tower on my screen. I'm going left. I'm looking for a shrine going right. I mean,
[1732.26s -> 1741.43s]  like it was like this. Now that I go like that, I can see it. It wasn't in frame. No, it wasn't.
[1741.43s -> 1748.52s]  You went up. No, I didn't. But I wasn't looking. All right. I'm going to go get the tower.
[1748.52s -> 1766.44s]  Can I make it from here? What is that? I'm falling off the cliff because I thought I was
[1766.44s -> 1788.22s]  zooming in. It's up on the D pad. OK, Guardian Skywatcher. What the hell is that? All right.
[1788.22s -> 1811.10s]  I'm going for it. Let's go. I just don't go in that light. I'm sick. I'm just going up there.
[1815.69s -> 1817.29s]  Oh, don't go over there. It's going to go.
[1824.89s -> 1827.69s]  But that's sort of way for that sort of way for that sort of way for that sort of way.
[1827.77s -> 1834.68s]  I'm going to start my fucking lightning. All right. OK, put how do I put the weapons out?
[1834.68s -> 1867.24s]  How do I unequip these? All right. Thought I got hit. Geez. Oh, you know what? Hold on.
[1869.32s -> 1891.99s]  Let me put my climbing gear back on. What the fuck? All right. Whatever.
[1900.73s -> 1909.21s]  Well, very obviously, I'm going in the wrong direction. I can still I think I can at least
[1909.21s -> 1919.24s]  get on the lip up there or something. Right. Come on, get up and stand. Come on and just stand up.
[1919.72s -> 1923.80s]  Come on, everybody. Just get up. Come on. Put your hands up. Everybody. Just stand up.
[1924.60s -> 1931.93s]  Come on. Put your hands up. Everybody. Just stand up. I forgot about that. That's like my
[1931.93s -> 1939.85s]  favorite song. Everybody put your hands up. Everybody. Just stand up. Everybody. Put your
[1939.85s -> 1952.12s]  hands up. Everybody. Just stand up. That's like so fucking funny. It really is. I it's genuinely
[1952.12s -> 1979.18s]  funny. Everybody put your hands up. Well, I need to hear it now. Right. Like I have to listen to
[1979.18s -> 1997.02s]  it now. There's no world where I don't put that on. Was it called the American Bible Challenge?
[1997.02s -> 2025.72s]  That's what it is. This is it. Right. OK. American Bible Challenge theme song. I want to be able
[2025.72s -> 2057.37s]  to hear it because I have my headphones plugged in a different spot. It's that this is I love
[2057.37s -> 2080.81s]  this so much. You have you have no idea. One more time. Then I think that's him singing it.
[2081.37s -> 2089.45s]  Right. Right. I think that's Jeff Fox really singing that. Is it? And then that makes it
[2089.45s -> 2099.24s]  so much better. No, not one more time. We're done. No shot. I am not kidding. I genuinely
[2099.24s -> 2105.82s]  like that. I love that song. It's so funny. It's it's perfect. I just love every second of it.
[2106.38s -> 2114.36s]  All right. I got to plug this back in. Hold on. Put your hands up. Everybody put your hands up
[2114.36s -> 2120.34s]  and stand up, too. And your hands up yet. Stand up and you better put your hands up.
[2120.34s -> 2167.43s]  Everybody stand up. This is not a crack stream. I can get up and stand up,
[2170.28s -> 2186.31s]  but I actually can, though. I actually can. I can. Damn it. I felt I'm doing this the wrong.
[2186.31s -> 2210.41s]  Oh, can I get up here this way? This probably one path. I can't do it. I don't think I can do it.
[2210.41s -> 2214.57s]  All right. Please tell me if I'm. Can I actually can I actually get up there and can I actually
[2214.57s -> 2223.18s]  stand up and put my hands up and climb up that? Can I do that? Or am I just wasting time here?
[2223.18s -> 2229.82s]  Yes. OK. Oh, just the weather is in the corner. Oh, all right. So it's going to be rainy for like
[2229.82s -> 2253.46s]  another few hours. Can I pass time? All right. It's almost gone. This guy's going to clear up
[2253.46s -> 2277.78s]  a little bit. All right. We got clear skies. Let's go. What? You piece of shit. Really? All right.
[2277.78s -> 2299.53s]  This guy's going to clear up actually in a minute. You have climbing clothes. They're on. What about
[2299.53s -> 2311.35s]  season's tier list? You got it. Well, where? What region? Where I am right now in Las Vegas
[2311.35s -> 2317.72s]  or what region? Because it depends in Boston, New England. All right. My favorite New England
[2317.72s -> 2325.18s]  season is not summer. It's like hot. It's kind of gross, sweaty, humid mosquitoes, bugs, ticks.
[2325.18s -> 2335.78s]  No, thank you. Spring. That's all right. It's cool. I'm a fall guy. I'm a fall guy from New England
[2335.78s -> 2345.08s]  and has nothing to do with the trees all change colors. No, I like that fall air. The fall air
[2345.08s -> 2352.09s]  is even over here in Vegas. It hits different, doesn't it? There is a different smell. Did I
[2352.09s -> 2360.63s]  wait too long and miss the fact that there was no rain? Whatever. Fall air, that like 60 degree fall
[2360.63s -> 2369.53s]  air has a certain sense to it. It's like that fall, slightly chilled, but like room temperature
[2369.53s -> 2376.78s]  on a kind of earthy sense. Do you know what I'm talking about? Fall has a certain smell.
[2376.78s -> 2385.40s]  It's not a smell. It's like a sense. It's like a crispy. Yes. It's a crispy sense in your like
[2385.40s -> 2401.78s]  face. Fall is the best. Winter is cool too. I like winter. Winter out in Vegas is actually really
[2401.78s -> 2410.04s]  cool because it's so cold, but there's no snow. It's just free. It's really cold, but no snow,
[2410.04s -> 2416.82s]  no precipitation. It's really interesting. So you can go. The air is so still and chilly,
[2416.82s -> 2422.97s]  but there's never any snow. This is an NPC conversation. Like you mean like a GTA NPC
[2422.97s -> 2432.25s]  or what do you mean by that? What? I can't talk about the weather. Why would it be like an NPC
[2432.25s -> 2454.26s]  conversation like in a game? This is a Morrowind NPC talking. A Morrowind NPC does not know. A
[2454.26s -> 2470.60s]  Morrowind NPC is like this. Hello afternoon. Hello. They don't do that. Watch it. They don't say
[2470.60s -> 2489.30s]  anything. The Morrowind NPC is not going to give a weather tier list. What are you talking about?
[2489.30s -> 2493.91s]  What the fuck? It's not raining. It's cloudy. It's supposed to be cloudy.
[2493.91s -> 2525.53s]  Oh my goodness. I don't have a weapon. All right. See ya. No.
[2528.17s -> 2560.63s]  It stopped. I found the place to go. Oh my God. I annihilated that guy. Oh shit. What do I do?
[2560.63s -> 2564.41s]  What do I do? What do I do? What do I do about that? What do I do? So I hide? How do you hide?
[2611.22s -> 2634.17s]  Man will always be smarter than machines. I'm going to try to stand right up here.
[2634.17s -> 2644.41s]  Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
[2644.41s -> 2676.84s]  I got it. I made it. You're doing a lot of Switch stuff, huh? Yeah, I am. I'll get away from the
[2676.84s -> 2683.69s]  Switch eventually here. But to be fair, let's be fair, there was a long period where I did not
[2683.69s -> 2690.94s]  turn this thing on for like eight months or something, right? So come on. It's only fair.
[2690.94s -> 2704.44s]  Are you going to finish the game on stream? I don't know. I can tell you all that I know.
[2704.44s -> 2710.95s]  And what I know is I'm very much enjoying playing it on stream and hanging out until that stops
[2710.95s -> 2714.55s]  being the case or until I want to be able to finish it off stream. I don't know. I'm still here.
[2714.63s -> 2724.04s]  What did that even do? I thought that was going to clear all the all the goo.
[2724.04s -> 2730.66s]  Oh my god. Get out of that. Get out of it. You better. All right. You're not going to tell me
[2730.66s -> 2746.22s]  what I should and should not do. Okay. You understand me? There's probably a few of them
[2746.22s -> 2768.17s]  that I have to get rid of, right? See any more eyes? Oh, I thought that was a chest. We got sword,
[2768.17s -> 2778.50s]  rusty sword, rusty shield. I'll take it. I can cook, but I don't. I don't. Ah, I'm not going to
[2778.50s -> 2787.26s]  take it actually. Never mind. I have tons of food. I don't need to cook. Oh, it's emote only mode.
[2787.26s -> 2822.68s]  That means it's a puzzle. It's a puzzle of foot. Okay. Can you shoot these? I'm going to blow these
[2822.68s -> 2844.39s]  up though. Wasn't that nothing? Nothing. All right. I'm just going to turn it on. I got four shrine.
[2844.39s -> 2862.68s]  This is going to be a shrine stream. Okay. So why does he keep over fucking reacting? It's like
[2862.68s -> 2881.22s]  annoying. Time the person out. Oh, you can't even write. Never mind. I can't gaslight you guys.
[2881.22s -> 2909.14s]  It's emote only. Never. I didn't even look. This thing's been low. Never mind. It's going to break
[2909.14s -> 2929.21s]  broken. All right. Let's use the club. Ooh. Can I sneak in there? Wow. That thing's actually
[2929.21s -> 2949.02s]  really powerful. 24. That's better than the Lionel sword. Okay. So let me go over here.
[2949.02s -> 2981.82s]  I can sneak in here. I found it. Did you hear the sound? I'm exploring. Don't tell me to hurry up.
[2981.82s -> 3002.98s]  I never would have found this chest if I did. Nice. Nice. 100 rupees. Now why is it on emote
[3002.98s -> 3012.95s]  only by the way? This seems pretty self-explanatory, doesn't it? I mean, now it does. I can't hit that
[3012.95s -> 3021.67s]  like piece of sinew, whatever it is. There's definitely another eyeball somewhere hiding.
[3021.67s -> 3055.51s]  All right. Maybe not. There's definitely an eyeball attached to this sinew. See you later.
[3055.51s -> 3077.37s]  Where is this? There's an eye somewhere. It has to be. It's definitely. It's going to be definitely
[3077.37s -> 3131.21s]  attached to the sinew. Um, can I break that? Where's this eye? Well, I'll go over here. All right.
[3131.21s -> 3147.56s]  Now what? I need some more weapons. I'm out of like shitty weapons to use. Wait a minute. Can I
[3147.56s -> 3174.15s]  burn it? I can burn it. I think I can burn it. Can I burn the sinew or can I? Where is this thing?
[3174.15s -> 3192.70s]  The inside of my, my brain is itching. The inside of my ear all the way in is itching.
[3192.70s -> 3216.89s]  There's an eyeball just sitting hidden somewhere and I got to find this stupid eye in here.
[3216.89s -> 3254.26s]  Shit. No, no, no, no, no. Oh my God. I almost died. I'm all right. I really hope there's no
[3254.26s -> 3284.54s]  goo up here. I can't climb that. Why? Oh shit. Hold on. I tried to jump, but he jumped up and
[3284.54s -> 3290.92s]  not back. How do you jump backwards? I wanted to, I wanted to jump backwards.
[3290.92s -> 3313.40s]  I don't want to jump. How do you jump out? I didn't want to jump up. How do you jump out?
[3313.40s -> 3327.61s]  Where is this thing? Oh, there's a chest over there. It has to be something with the fire.
[3327.61s -> 3332.62s]  It has to be with the fire. Don't not like this me. Bomb arrow. All right. It's got to be like a
[3332.62s -> 3394.54s]  explode something. I don't know. I, there's no eye. I'm looking for another eye or fish.
[3394.54s -> 3455.85s]  Should I release them? No, not yet. I don't understand what's happening. I don't get it.
[3455.85s -> 3479.14s]  Can I do, can I do this right now? Do I have to come back here later? Grab. I'm going to try.
[3479.14s -> 3482.66s]  Okay. Can I, can I even hurt this stuff or do I have to hit? I was under the impression you
[3482.66s -> 3491.08s]  couldn't hurt this shit. Like you have to destroy the eyeball. That's the only way. But can I,
[3491.08s -> 3526.04s]  can I bomb the sinew? I'll try it. I mean, I'm lost. I'm going to bomb that sinew right there.
[3526.04s -> 3543.22s]  Wait. Soccer ball kick. Catch. Kapow. Referee. Touchdown. What's that? Shoot the cannons at it.
[3543.22s -> 3550.82s]  Shoot the cannons at the, all right. Shoot the cannons. Shoot. Turn the cannons around
[3550.82s -> 3565.67s]  and fire the cannons at that. Shoot the bomb through the touchdown. Shoot ball. Ball goes
[3565.67s -> 3588.14s]  touchdown. Fly torch. Ball goes touchdown. Santa Claus. There's no Santa Claus here.
[3588.14s -> 3607.11s]  Catch. Catch football. Throw football. Touchdown. I don't know. What? What are you talking about?
[3607.19s -> 3621.85s]  Cold. Chill. Throw. Touchdown. Where, is there a place where I can put a bomb?
[3621.85s -> 3677.85s]  That's something over here, right? Oh my God. What the? What? Hold on. Oh shit. My cover. Oh no.
[3677.85s -> 3732.31s]  Um, dude, you fucking idiot. Let him out. Let him out. Let him out. Let him out. I don't care. Let
[3732.31s -> 3734.87s]  him out. Let him out. Let him out. Let him out. Let him out. Tell me. Just give me the,
[3734.87s -> 3738.81s]  give me the solution right now. Just tell me, just tell me the answer. I'm going to get kicked
[3738.81s -> 3741.29s]  out of class. I'm going to get detention. I'm going to stand up right now in the middle of the
[3741.29s -> 3761.00s]  test. I want the, give me the answer. Climb to just climb. What? I thought it was a puzzle.
[3762.10s -> 3771.00s]  Just climb. Just climb is the answer. No, it can't be. Just climb. It's not a puzzle or like,
[3771.00s -> 3786.66s]  oh, I'm going to get like a puzzle shit. Just climb it. There's a magnetized platform. There
[3786.66s -> 3817.19s]  it is. But what was the football thing with the hands up? Climbing is the puzzle. I pressed B.
[3817.19s -> 3834.78s]  Why did it not register? Hold on. Let me just heal. Okay. So just climb up, but there's a
[3834.78s -> 3844.10s]  magnetized thing, dude. Okay. I'm getting sick and gosh, darn tired of that happening. It just
[3844.10s -> 3849.99s]  doesn't register the jump. It's not, it's not the controller. It's the game's input engine. Okay.
[3849.99s -> 3884.06s]  Okay. So what the heck? There's a magnetized platform. I tried climbing up that side. Use
[3884.06s -> 3905.96s]  the stasis. Oh, oh my God. Link stop just gluing to every single surface. All right. Down by the
[3905.96s -> 3924.71s]  eye that you killed, there's a magnetized thing. What the fuck was that? I, what is happening?
[3924.71s -> 3930.31s]  Why is that not? I'm pissing off. I'm getting pissed off actually. How come I can't activate
[3930.31s -> 3995.48s]  it? This is where the eye was killed. You just passed it. Huh? It's outside. What? This is the,
[3995.48s -> 4031.10s]  this was the solution. I'm not going to die to the sludge. This, this little metallic door buried in
[4031.10s -> 4067.38s]  the goo is the solution of the puzzle. Get out of here. This guy takes a lot of hits. Yeah. So
[4067.38s -> 4074.73s]  what now? What did you mean by it's the uprights? That's a good shield. All right. So now I can put
[4074.73s -> 4088.04s]  this over here, bro. You talking about do this and then it'll fall like that. Oh, come on, dude.
[4088.04s -> 4100.68s]  What the fuck? What? I'm sitting here looking for eyeballs to kill because I thought it was going
[4100.68s -> 4114.18s]  to get rid of whatever. That's, how is that a touchdown? That's not a touchdown. Well, that was
[4114.18s -> 4129.10s]  fun. Let me throw this away because this thing is 40. So people are saying you can actually just
[4129.10s -> 4135.08s]  climb it up it. Can you though? I feel like every, I tried to climb that. It wouldn't let me do it.
[4136.23s -> 4146.10s]  Do I, do you like damage just hurt? Just, just go. You can't though. You can. It's on the,
[4146.10s -> 4159.91s]  it's the pillar. Okay. What's wrong with my character? You can jump off the half arch.
[4159.91s -> 4180.50s]  That took so long. I have, oh, I'm cold. Okay. Is there a, does this make me warmer? I don't think
[4180.50s -> 4192.52s]  so. That literally took an hour. No, it didn't. It took like 25 minutes. I had like a 30 minute
[4192.52s -> 4198.20s]  opening of the stream and then I was walking around for a little bit and it's been 20 minutes.
[4198.20s -> 4226.02s]  Do not add an hour just because it makes it funnier. It was 20 minutes. Eat something.
[4226.02s -> 4258.02s]  You're going to die. I'll be all right. All right. Look. Hey, we made it. We made it. How is that
[4258.02s -> 4264.90s]  kicking a football? Somebody give me a full sentence. Hey, I want a complete sentence on how
[4264.90s -> 4291.69s]  throwing a football through the uprights is what I had to do there. The hands he makes was gas
[4291.69s -> 4302.42s]  lighting. Throw down the path bridge to go up. At the arch you have to touch down the plank.
[4302.42s -> 4315.45s]  The hands point up. You can climb up. It's the shape of the magnet. Oh my God. What?
[4316.09s -> 4323.24s]  It is the shape of a magnet. And you were saying I needed to pick. Okay. Well, I would never have
[4323.24s -> 4340.23s]  gotten that. That's so funny. All right. Cold resistance. This one here. All right. Look,
[4340.23s -> 4343.35s]  I got it. All right. Now let me do what I want to do with the thing that I like doing the most.
[4343.35s -> 4357.99s]  And that's go to the shrines. Should I go to this one first? Which one should I do first?
[4357.99s -> 4400.98s]  I'm just going to go to this one first. Whatever. This one. All right. Yes. Let's play. Let's go.
[4400.98s -> 4415.77s]  Yes. That's right. Okay. Bye for like another 30 minutes. I'm going to do this in 15 minutes.
[4415.77s -> 4429.03s]  Goodbye. See you in 15 minutes when it's done. See you in 15 minutes tops when it's done. What
[4429.03s -> 4446.66s]  time is it right now? It is 4 11 right now. PM Pacific at 4 21 at 4 20 at 4 26. You'll be let
[4446.66s -> 4514.55s]  out. All right. Here we go. Got it. Times it for 12. It's been one minute. I'm almost done.
[4514.55s -> 4557.96s]  Do not bet against me. Just saying. Don't bet against me. And a surprise. A few people here,
[4557.96s -> 4579.51s]  I think. Hmm. Okay. Very cool. What's next? All right. Cool. All right. Just checking out some
[4579.51s -> 4656.65s]  stuff. Very nice. All right. What's this? Okay. Let's go. I'm going to scream so bad to get the
[4656.65s -> 4676.17s]  energy out. You know what I mean? Just like reset it. Oh, look at that. Let's bet against them.
[4676.17s -> 4684.31s]  Let's bet against them. Times it. Oh, wait. How much time do I have? Oh, look at that. Who
[4684.31s -> 4693.05s]  bet against me? Which one? Which one of you bet against me? Who did? It's 4 15 right now. I'm
[4693.05s -> 4716.70s]  11 minutes early. Just saying. I'm 11 minutes early. Literally the easiest shrine. Well, why
[4716.70s -> 4729.53s]  did you bet against me then? That's your fault. How do I get the? I have two, by the way. I'm
[4729.53s -> 4741.48s]  covering the screen, you know. I lost a million points. Ooh. I did say don't bet against me.
[4741.48s -> 4750.60s]  I made it very clear. You didn't get the chest. Well, I completed the shrine. I'll go back in.
[4750.60s -> 4772.82s]  Well, could I pick something up? The rules for completion are getting the orb. Yeah,
[4772.82s -> 4803.13s]  come on. Nice. All right. So how do I get this? That was interesting.
[4819.10s -> 4831.35s]  All right. So now I mean, I think I have to walk on this. Can I hit it with a bow?
[4831.35s -> 4855.26s]  Oops, a daisy. Okay. What? Where is it? I do I jump on that? I don't get it. How do I stop it?
[4855.26s -> 4898.50s]  Good luck. I'm imagining I have to stop that. I'm going to run out of arrows. Oh, come on. All
[4898.50s -> 4914.47s]  right. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. You got to get the lip. It is stuck on the lip.
[4914.47s -> 4926.18s]  Yeah. I stuck on the lip Andy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Whatever. God. Just do it.
[4926.18s -> 4937.38s]  Just do it and stop. There's going to be an apple in this chest. It's not going to be worth doing.
[4937.38s -> 4956.50s]  Oh my God. Don't jump. Why am I jumping? Just crouch. I'm going to have no arrows. It's so
[4956.50s -> 4971.21s]  stupid. If there are. All right. If there are five arrows in this chest, I'm going to uninstall the
[4971.21s -> 5024.55s]  game. Damn it. Hold on. Oh, thank God. Don't screw this up. All right. I'm glad it's not five
[5024.55s -> 5044.73s]  arrows because I didn't want to uninstall the game. How do I get out of here? Pick up your arrows.
[5044.73s -> 5056.90s]  Oh my God. I forgot you could do that. All right. I'm going to pee. Never back. Pee time. That's
[5056.90s -> 5061.86s]  where I deserve peeing. By the way, it's 421. Even if I did that, it still wouldn't be 426.
[5061.86s -> 5190.62s]  I still whoever bet against me still lose. One sec. Why did I die? Oh, it's cold. Right.
[5192.87s -> 5205.46s]  I froze. Okay. That was cool. That was a fun one. Let's do another one. Where's the other one?
[5205.46s -> 5209.02s]  There's a couple other here. There's that one. Is that I'm going to go to that one down there.
[5209.02s -> 5220.25s]  Get a big hole. My favorite part about this game is that there's atmosphere.
[5220.25s -> 5258.97s]  So when you go higher in the atmosphere, it gets colder. Yeah, I think. Holy. Oh,
[5258.97s -> 5274.70s]  this one right there. All right. I'm going to go to this one and that one. Should we
[5274.70s -> 5299.61s]  place bets again? This way, that way, this way, that way. What if a middle hair part?
[5300.17s -> 5306.71s]  I don't know. My hair naturally just parts that way. I think. Yeah. I mean, I can do this,
[5306.71s -> 5321.29s]  but show Otto. I showed Otto like a week ago. He's fine. He's just chilling. He's chilling,
[5321.29s -> 5326.90s]  chilling out in his bed, chewing on a bone. He's having fun. I don't want to disturb him.
[5326.90s -> 5349.11s]  All right. Let's do 15 minutes. Let's go. It's 426 right now. That's 36 at 441. I will have this
[5349.11s -> 5357.40s]  completed 441. Let's go. Done. Easy. This would be the easiest one all night. That was on purpose.
[5357.40s -> 5361.32s]  If you didn't know, I did that on purpose to make a funny thing. So everyone would go, oh my God,
[5361.32s -> 5367.59s]  he got hit by the rock rolling. Actually true. I actually did that on purpose. And if you,
[5367.59s -> 5371.27s]  people are like, oh, he's like pretending that he did it on purpose and like pretending that
[5371.27s -> 5374.95s]  it wasn't on purpose. Right? No, I did that on purpose. I want to make that really clear
[5374.95s -> 5382.62s]  and transparent with everybody here. I'm not kidding. Okay. All right. So let's obviously,
[5382.62s -> 5411.46s]  we have to freeze that. Okay. Good. All right. I shut this one off. I broke this one. Okay.
[5411.46s -> 5416.02s]  That one's magical. Why is that one magical? Oh, they're all, they're all okay. Nevermind.
[5445.11s -> 5467.80s]  Game's fucking easy. Shit. Yeah. I know. I know. I know. Skip. I just can't die. Just don't die.
[5467.80s -> 5478.46s]  I'll be fine. I can pick those ones up. Weird. Oh, what weird. I can pick those up.
[5479.34s -> 5523.98s]  Strange. What is that for? Weird. Interesting. Kind of weird. Okay. Weird. That's good. I'll take it.
[5523.98s -> 5558.68s]  Thank God. All right. There's only one of these, right? All right. I got a plan. Imagine voting
[5558.68s -> 5567.29s]  against me. Imagine voting against me. Right. So many of you guys just probably just lost twice
[5567.29s -> 5590.49s]  in a row. That's three spirit orbs. I got the chest too. It's 11 minutes early. I should drop
[5590.49s -> 5606.84s]  it to 10 minutes. The game is quiet. I'll take care of that. That's one of the easiest in the
[5606.84s -> 5614.01s]  game. So vote accordingly then. All right. Where's the other one? I want to do all these
[5614.01s -> 5620.65s]  shrines. I love them. A lot of people say that their favorite part of this game is when Link
[5620.65s -> 5657.34s]  goes, but mine is the shrines. I would say. You're wrong. All right. Let's do, I'm going to,
[5657.34s -> 5661.19s]  I'm just going to keep teleporting back here and just fly to them. So much easier than walking.
[5661.19s -> 5684.98s]  Where was that other one? Oh, right here. This is a bad idea. Wasn't there another one down here?
[5688.28s -> 5736.06s]  If I land over here, I think I should be fine. So watch out for this butt head. Yeah. Sorry. Yeah.
[5736.06s -> 5747.59s]  I, my language is pretty, it's pretty bad. I'm sorry. Where are you? Is this water too cold
[5747.59s -> 5775.46s]  or something? Am I going to get hurt in here? I made it. Wait, what's this? Ooh, radishes.
[5775.46s -> 5779.82s]  I should have taken a picture of it. I'm an idiot. These things are one of the most high quality
[5779.82s -> 5803.37s]  foods in the game. And what? In real life. Looking for one of those little seed guys, whatever.
[5812.12s -> 5825.53s]  Walk off the cliff. Oh, all right. Where is it? It's right there. Drop it. Then take a picture.
[5827.19s -> 5843.64s]  Oh, so it, it still works that way. Oh, it does still work. You're right. You're right. I like
[5843.64s -> 5867.05s]  this area. Uh-oh. Bandits. Uh-oh. Bandits. Let's go. All right. 10 minutes. When I press the button,
[5867.05s -> 5870.49s]  I'm, I'm giving, I'm making it easier for you if you want to bet against me. 10 minutes.
[5871.05s -> 5889.06s]  The time is at 435. Wait till I get in. This doesn't count yet. I have to get actually into
[5889.06s -> 5909.99s]  the shrine. You have to get the chest too? No, it's just for the shrine. If you're reading this,
[5909.99s -> 5916.38s]  I hope you're having a good day. Hey, you too. Thank you. All right. I got 10 minutes to complete
[5916.38s -> 5923.59s]  the shrine. Let's go. Minor test of strength. Oh, you guys are whoever batted against me.
[5924.79s -> 5939.02s]  You've got, I don't know. You've got some time here. Uh, um, seriously? I think this is free
[5939.02s -> 5943.10s]  money for anybody that's going to bet for me. This is free money. You're literally watching
[5943.10s -> 5949.14s]  it right now. You can still bet it's free money. This is free money. I'm just telling you right
[5949.14s -> 5964.79s]  now, you're going to get channel points for free. It's free money. It's, I mean, it's free money.
[5966.52s -> 5978.58s]  I forgot that. I forgot the move set, but it's free money. It's actually free money. Watch.
[6000.62s -> 6009.10s]  It's free money. It's literally, it's free money. You just, I'm not understanding that.
[6009.10s -> 6021.27s]  It wasn't even, the timer wasn't even over yet. Oh hell yeah. Ancient battleaxe. Dude,
[6021.27s -> 6031.94s]  the timer wasn't even over and you still could have got it. You cheated. You eat it. What? This
[6031.94s -> 6048.78s]  isn't Dark Souls PVP. Cheated. He eat it. Cheated. He eat it. Oh, please. Giant ancient core.
[6048.78s -> 6074.60s]  Extremely rare find. Ooh. Ancient armor. Ooh. Don't sit. Please save those. Don't make anything.
[6074.60s -> 6082.20s]  Okay. I got four. I'm going to do stamina, but I'm not doing it until I have at least a double
[6082.20s -> 6097.70s]  turn in. That's how it works. What was it? It was 90% voted that you were going to do it. It's so
[6097.70s -> 6103.37s]  funny. I think the, the like 4% of you that voted that I was not going to do that. I think we're
[6103.37s -> 6108.97s]  banking on, uh, like my house getting struck by lightning and the power going out, right? Like
[6108.97s -> 6117.34s]  it's like, it could happen. It could, and you'd get a huge return, but it's not probable. It's
[6117.34s -> 6123.58s]  like, man, it's possible that like his internet just goes out now, right? It's possible, but not
[6123.58s -> 6128.71s]  completely, not probable. It's possible. All right. Where was that last one?
[6136.65s -> 6155.37s]  You were too overconfident. That's why I doubt it. Oh, 75 million versus 3.5 million. Damn. Wait,
[6155.37s -> 6160.17s]  does that mean that the people that bet 3.5 million, it goes to the people that bet their
[6160.17s -> 6168.25s]  points? That's how that works, right? So would you guys get like 50 points each? That was what,
[6168.25s -> 6170.97s]  that probably wasn't, I mean, that's a safe return, but it's not a big return.
[6174.14s -> 6179.34s]  We've basically gotten nothing. The three and a half million got split to everyone. That's so
[6179.34s -> 6188.68s]  funny. I got 10 K. I got two K. I got a, I got 150 points. I got six K. I bet six K and I got
[6188.68s -> 6203.61s]  6.9 K back. Okay. Safe return. That was a safe investment you made. Where the hell am I? Wait,
[6203.61s -> 6217.53s]  what? Oh, I went to the wrong place. The people that were betting no had a 22.5 time return.
[6217.53s -> 6243.70s]  If they won a lot, bring back, you need channel point rewards. I know the thing is I need to find
[6243.70s -> 6247.86s]  a way to make something for channel points. That's not going to just like destroy every stream.
[6247.86s -> 6252.04s]  Those of you that remember when channel points first came out and it was like, oh, what do I do
[6252.04s -> 6256.30s]  with these? I had a thing where you could redeem a certain amount of, was it a hundred thousand or
[6256.30s -> 6262.10s]  75,000 to make me wink on camera. And it's like, oh, that's funny. It's like a hundred thousand
[6262.10s -> 6267.42s]  points. That's a lot of points. And people were redeeming them every 15 to 25 seconds at one
[6267.42s -> 6273.91s]  point. It's just like, I can't do that. I'm not going to wink every fucking 30 seconds. It's weird.
[6273.91s -> 6276.95s]  And then eventually I just stopped doing it. And then I did one where I just
[6277.59s -> 6284.41s]  caught up and did it like 5,000 times or something. Right. All right. So where was it? There was one
[6284.41s -> 6302.58s]  more. What was it? I swear there was one more. Am I crazy? There was definitely one more. What was it?
[6302.58s -> 6312.46s]  Check the pins. Well, the problem with the pins is I never removed them. There's a pin right there.
[6312.46s -> 6330.84s]  What's that pin for? What did I pin? What did I pin? I think it was this one down here.
[6331.70s -> 6344.98s]  Did I do them all? It's in a canyon down here. I just don't, I don't, down, down, down.
[6344.98s -> 6359.61s]  Where? Look down. Where is it? Between these two. Where? Where is it? Down there. All right. Down
[6359.61s -> 6388.23s]  here. It's like down here, right? Yeah. Yeah. Mini map. No, I, yeah, I know. I was just making sure
[6388.23s -> 6395.43s]  I had it in the right place. Hey, sunglasses Andy. Look at the mini map. I know I'm going,
[6395.43s -> 6401.18s]  look where I'm going. I'm going in the right direction. Why are my sunglasses Andy? What does
[6401.18s -> 6428.95s]  that mean? Smarten up fuck face. I like that comment. That's funny. Smarten up. All right.
[6428.95s -> 6440.54s]  10 minutes. It is 4 44. The second that I go in here, the timer begins. I would start to bet now
[6440.54s -> 6447.91s]  because we don't want to give anybody. No, you know what? Forget that. It starts. I'm not going
[6447.91s -> 6454.09s]  in here yet. We're waiting until people bet because I don't want people to get an advantage.
[6456.54s -> 6461.42s]  It's the timer starts not 4 50, not 4 55. It starts when I go in here because I don't want
[6461.42s -> 6466.90s]  people to get an advantage because they're going to see, Oh, it's a, it's a minor combat test. I'm
[6466.90s -> 6476.23s]  going to bet this way, right? So it's not 4 55. It's like 4 56 or something, right? Yeah. So you
[6476.23s -> 6487.48s]  don't get, no, you, you have to bet now without knowing what it is. Oh, wait, we were fun. One
[6487.48s -> 6494.60s]  wink a year. I just burnt my eye when I did that. I hope you all know. There you go. Yeah. Well,
[6494.60s -> 6504.39s]  I beat this in 10 minutes. The thing is, a lot of you guys have played this game. Why am I acting
[6504.39s -> 6509.54s]  like the game came out a week ago? This game's been off for like four and a half years. So a
[6509.54s -> 6514.92s]  lot of you guys know what is in here. So those of you that don't know what's in here, I mean,
[6514.92s -> 6534.55s]  you can just Google it and find out and decide whatever. That's all right. Well, I beat this
[6534.55s -> 6569.18s]  shrine in 10 minutes starting now. What's the ratio? Power of fire. Oh shit. It's not a minor
[6569.18s -> 6593.53s]  combat shrine. Oh, okay. Power of fire. That's easy. I don't have any arrows. Oh,
[6598.49s -> 6626.36s]  don't need arrows. I don't know why I thought that just said, let's go. Like, let's go. All right.
[6626.36s -> 6655.98s]  Now I got to knock that down. I don't have any arrows. Shit. I'm good. Why is that here? Why is
[6655.98s -> 6677.64s]  that? There's a little lip there. Why? All right. So now I got, okay. All right. Okay. Can't knock
[6677.64s -> 6713.98s]  this down. I got the treasure chest. Knight's bow. All right. Get rid of this fucking thing. 83
[6713.98s -> 6728.22s]  to 17. Yes. Goodness. All right. So I can't let you guys down. How am I going to break the ones
[6728.22s -> 6754.82s]  higher though? Isn't that impossible? If I don't have arrows, how can I shoot it? All right. I'm
[6754.82s -> 6766.31s]  going to time a bit here. I'm on a timer here. Hold on. You break this one. Excuse me. Wait,
[6766.31s -> 6803.88s]  what? Oh, oh, we're good. I got five minutes. Oh, I win. I got the chest too. That's everything.
[6803.88s -> 6826.49s]  So that's all the shrines. Good. Very cool. Very cool. Very cool. Easiest points of my life.
[6826.49s -> 6844.07s]  Yeah. I had some time to spare. I had at least four or five minutes to spare. How come you're
[6844.07s -> 6859.70s]  only good when we bet? When I stop pretending. All right. So now, interesting. I got the shrines.
[6859.70s -> 6865.74s]  I could over here, I guess, right? I guess I'm just going to try to find a road and just go up
[6865.74s -> 6882.55s]  this way. See what I find. No, you know what? Let's go back to the tower. Is that, let me
[6883.45s -> 6908.49s]  get a good kind of bird's eye view of this whole place. Don't listen to the haters.
[6908.49s -> 6916.17s]  OK, so this is where I want to go, is over here. I'm going to put a pin right here because I want
[6916.17s -> 6924.36s]  to see how far away it is. I can't even see it anyways. All right. So it's past the volcano.
[6924.36s -> 6929.42s]  So the volcano is the next major thing that I have to do. So why don't I go over here
[6930.31s -> 6938.18s]  that way and then up? Wait, around the volcano? I'm going to go to that tower over there.
[6938.18s -> 6945.56s]  Wait, what's that? There's something right here. And then I'm going to go here and I'm going to go
[6945.56s -> 6966.14s]  this way and then bang a right over there, I guess. OK, is this a oh, this is a stable. Cool.
[6967.10s -> 6977.66s]  I'm a traveler. You must be a man who sets his mind on something and then gets it done.
[6977.66s -> 6984.78s]  I'm the best. OK, I was really into sword fighting, but I'm a bit of a rut with it.
[6984.78s -> 6989.58s]  Doesn't help that the sword I'm using right now is way too blunt. That's why I thought
[6989.58s -> 6993.58s]  if I can get that legendary sword, maybe a new path will open for me. What do you think?
[6995.80s -> 7000.04s]  Finally figured out that it's near Death Mountain. However, it doesn't seem to be
[7000.04s -> 7007.14s]  in this direction. Maybe it's on the opposite side, closer to the Woodland Stable. Maybe I'll just
[7007.14s -> 7040.42s]  mosey over to the Woodland Stable. What are you doing over there? What?
[7040.42s -> 7044.10s]  Oh, wait. No, Highland Stable. Where's the Woodlands? Oh, I haven't found it. OK.
[7046.31s -> 7078.86s]  OK, let's get Frank II over here. I've got to buy some stuff. Thank you. Let's get some.
[7080.33s -> 7087.62s]  I actually think I have some food to make, don't I? All right. Very hydrating liquid. Heat
[7087.62s -> 7092.10s]  resistance. I mean, I'm going to the Fire Mountain right now. Let's let's do that.
[7100.34s -> 7121.10s]  Heat resistance. Yep. Heat resistance. I mean, it means it's a volcano.
[7121.10s -> 7148.54s]  See what I get from this. All right. Six and a half minutes of low level heat resistance. Good.
[7148.54s -> 7163.21s]  Individual radish. Wait, movement speed. All right. I'm going to do movement speed and radish.
[7163.21s -> 7187.37s]  It's going to be pretty sick, right? But then I work. That didn't work. Boost your movement
[7187.37s -> 7193.91s]  speed when the seeds are cooked into a dish. What happened? Oh, god damn it. All right.
[7193.91s -> 7205.13s]  Whatever. I forgot. I thought this was just yummy. Well, that was a waste, but whatever.
[7212.28s -> 7237.34s]  OK. All right. What about any lixir? I don't think I have anything, right? I don't think
[7237.34s -> 7255.21s]  I have anything. Wood in your food. Here we go. All right. Three and a half minutes of movement
[7255.21s -> 7294.81s]  speed. Do it again. A dash of salt. Good. Now. Do I have any, like, hot heat clothings? I don't
[7294.81s -> 7308.39s]  think so. I'm going to wear the heavy armor. I feel like it's better for now. All right. Hi.
[7308.39s -> 7325.30s]  Hello, Frank, too. There is a general story around here. You have a store, right? No, I don't.
[7325.30s -> 7353.08s]  Beetle. Beetle. Oh, is this Beetle? Thanks. A guardian in the eye. To find him, go way
[7353.08s -> 7360.12s]  north past Zora's domain all the way to Kala Ancient Tech Lab. All right. Somebody remember
[7360.12s -> 7376.30s]  that. Write that down. What do you got? OK. Yep. Arrows times ten. Give that to me. How many of
[7376.30s -> 7387.08s]  these do you have? What a waste of money. I'm not buying that. Oh, speed boost. Fire elixir. Let's
[7387.08s -> 7399.58s]  go. OK. Let's just. You know what? Just buy it. Buy the whole store. Take the whole thing. That's
[7399.58s -> 7408.39s]  a lot of money. Whoa. Hold on a minute. That's a lot. That's too much money. Is that too much money
[7408.39s -> 7420.68s]  or should I just buy it? Let's do it. Whatever. Speed boost. Yeah. I mean, I have a lot of materials
[7420.68s -> 7432.12s]  to make elixirs. Let's do it. And because I'm a piece of shit, you know, how much is that? No,
[7432.12s -> 7447.54s]  way too much. All right. Let's go make some heat elixirs. Wait, look what I got. I need some
[7447.54s -> 7455.02s]  backseat Andes to help me. Should I just sell all these? OK. If I keep selling all of my ore,
[7455.02s -> 7466.50s]  I'm not going to have any ore to do anything in the rest of the game. Keep the luminous ones.
[7466.50s -> 7474.23s]  Keep three of each. You barely need them. Keep like three of each. They're easy to get. OK. Well,
[7474.23s -> 7499.29s]  or do I use to upgrade armor? Oh, that's right. I'll sell two of each. OK. I'm not going to sell
[7499.29s -> 7508.04s]  the luminous ones. What about these? Two hundred and sixty bucks. Really? Is this bad if I sell?
[7509.77s -> 7513.77s]  It doesn't. I don't think I use them in anything. Sell the gems. These are just money, right?
[7513.77s -> 7532.49s]  That's a lot. All right. Now I actually have some cash. Oh, no. All right. Now I'm going to make a
[7532.49s -> 7549.98s]  bunch of elixirs. Goodbye. It's a pretty good Mario impression. OK. So if I do two lizards,
[7549.98s -> 7560.09s]  if I go boom, boom, double heat lizard. And then what's what's a rare ingredient? Just do one,
[7560.09s -> 7577.35s]  not two. Just one. What's the highest quality monster part that I have? Does that matter?
[7577.99s -> 7591.45s]  The guts? Does it actually matter? Oh, do what about the lionel horn? This would be like a this
[7591.45s -> 7602.15s]  would be like an hour of heat resistance. No, no, no. Don't do that. Keep the keep this for later.
[7602.15s -> 7610.26s]  OK. What about like the horn? Like these? These look like they're high quality. Keep Lionel. OK.
[7610.26s -> 7624.14s]  All right. All right. Let's go. Let's see what this does. High level fireproof effect,
[7624.14s -> 7627.77s]  which prevents your body from catching fire. Be sure to pack this when venturing to explore
[7627.77s -> 7631.85s]  the Death Mountain, which is where you're going. OK. Yes. All right. Ten minutes. Let's do another
[7631.85s -> 7651.64s]  one. Oh, that wasn't a good one. Why was that one worse? All right. Well, whatever.
[7651.64s -> 7673.74s]  Why was that one worse? All right. Lizard. Temporary hearts. Oh, no guts. OK. Oh,
[7673.74s -> 7684.55s]  oh, it's just a full heel. That's pretty sick. Oops. That's OK. Fuck. I ruined everything.
[7684.55s -> 7691.88s]  Can I reload the game? Where's my last save? Sixteen fifty three. When was that?
[7691.88s -> 7724.50s]  It's good. It's OK. No, no, no, it's fine. All right. All right. Don't sell the Lionel hoof.
[7724.50s -> 7760.22s]  Why does that sound like I'm saying that word wrong? Mid level haste. Nice. You can't really
[7760.22s -> 7784.55s]  softlock yourself. You'll find pretty much more of everything. All right. Five arrows. I already did.
[7784.55s -> 7794.55s]  All right. I'm ready to do Mount Doom. Where is it? I got tons of food. I'm ready. Look at all this.
[7794.55s -> 7799.19s]  Look at it. I've got more food. I'm a goddamn catering service. I've got plenty of food. Let's
[7799.19s -> 7840.39s]  go. All right, Frank. Let's go. So where do I want to go? I got to go this way. So I'm thinking maybe
[7840.39s -> 7858.20s]  just wrap around. I don't know. Let's find out. I go down and then right. Let's see where I go.
[7858.20s -> 7872.36s]  Oh, my God. I just fucking ran that over. I don't know you could do that.
[7872.36s -> 7905.83s]  Oh, pretty. Stay right here. Oh, it's a bomb. Good. Why did it? It's a bomb. Why did it explode?
[7905.83s -> 7946.30s]  OK, we're good. Flurry rush. Oh, my God. He killed me in one hit. Hey, that's not going to be on
[7946.30s -> 7958.34s]  cooldown, right? Did I just get absolutely decimated there? What happened? I died twice.
[7958.34s -> 7966.33s]  OK, we're good. Let's do this the right way this time, please.
[7967.05s -> 8012.63s]  How do you miss that? It's so easy. I'm going to scream. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. He overhand
[8012.63s -> 8039.11s]  swung me in the head. Whatever that is. Let me. Whatever that is. A huge sword just dropped. His
[8039.11s -> 8058.28s]  big sword dropped. Oh, yeah. All right. Who's left? Nice. Very good. No more melee weapons.
[8058.28s -> 8071.72s]  Excuse me. Oh, those guts are worth a lot, right? There was a huge sword that dropped over here.
[8071.72s -> 8081.88s]  What is that? Knights Claymore. Oh, yep. OK, what should I get rid of? I feel like this thing's
[8081.88s -> 8097.66s]  cool, but should I just get rid of it? It's cool. It's good. Just take a picture of it. Oh, hold on.
[8097.66s -> 8126.68s]  You're right. Good idea. OK, ice rod. All right. Oh, damn, this thing's cool looking. Oh, all right.
[8126.68s -> 8138.31s]  I think I'm good. I don't have any more room. Keep the rod. Stop it. What should I get rid of?
[8140.30s -> 8147.98s]  Get rid of the twelve spear away. But look at it. It's shining. This thing's got to go.
[8147.98s -> 8173.66s]  Didn't I? This was in a chest. One of the guardian swords. I like it. I like that. What are you doing?
[8173.66s -> 8180.12s]  All right. I'm getting people. People are doing the. OK, whatever. Drop the spear. It's blue.
[8180.12s -> 8209.88s]  It's my favorite color. I'm not dropping it. I replaced the five bomb arrows I shot into nothing.
[8209.88s -> 8227.45s]  OK, here we go. We're going to keep going up the road, right? Yep. A is not there. I need some more
[8227.45s -> 8240.28s]  seeds. Yeah, I need some more seeds to upgrade that inventory. I forgot to blink. All right. So
[8240.28s -> 8264.84s]  I'm going to keep going this way. Hopefully this eventually leads to the mountain. I'm going away
[8264.84s -> 8293.58s]  from the mountain. Let go of the stick. Trust me. Huh? Are you serious? The horse will steer itself.
[8293.58s -> 8304.09s]  I did. Why would I have ever thought that was a thing? Are you serious? Wait, what's over here?
[8306.82s -> 8365.83s]  Yep. Stay right there. Stop. Red Choo Choo Jelly. Cool. I do that strategy, man. It doesn't work.
[8365.83s -> 8373.14s]  It's my first stream here. I had fun playing this. It's the first game I ever bought. Is that what
[8373.14s -> 8390.68s]  you said? I hope so. Yeah, that's great. It's really, really fun. OK, what's in the chest?
[8390.68s -> 8404.20s]  It's a hundred bucks. I'll take it. I mean, I'm not going to say no to a hundred dollars, right?
[8404.20s -> 8417.06s]  Cool. What else is down here? Some weird down here. Some weird shit down here. I'm getting the
[8418.39s -> 8449.27s]  ding ding. I'm getting dings here. Do the new viewer song. I can't do the new viewer song anymore.
[8449.27s -> 8454.55s]  Oh, it didn't hit. It hit somebody in there. Oh my God. That's so frustrating. I'm in trouble now.
[8459.66s -> 8496.97s]  I can't do the new viewer song anymore. My God. Get out of here. You got a big sword. Where's he
[8496.97s -> 8566.02s]  going? Stop. Stop swinging. I cannot even hurt these guys. What the fuck? No, I don't want to
[8566.02s -> 8588.02s]  eat any of this food. You know what I mean? I don't want to eat any of the food. It all seems
[8588.02s -> 8611.67s]  too important. I don't want to eat this. I'll eat this. OK. All right. Well, that could have gone
[8611.67s -> 8639.62s]  way better. That was a good shot. Are you guys trying to punch me in the face? Very good. All
[8639.62s -> 8647.67s]  right. Cool. Now let's do it. My God. My goodness. The big sword dropped. Yeah, I'll go get it.
[8647.67s -> 8670.02s]  Where did that guy die? All right. Cobble crusher. I think kind of sucks. This thing's almost broken
[8670.02s -> 8687.30s]  though. So whatever. Fuck it. I'll use it. What's in the chest? Oh, it can be used as a pickaxe.
[8688.55s -> 8713.72s]  Really? Oh, hell yeah. All right. Remind me not to use this for anything besides this. Very cool.
[8713.72s -> 8726.12s]  So where should I give it to me? Why are you so short? Because when God made me, he was like,
[8726.12s -> 8733.32s]  nah, this guy would be way too powerful. He'd be far too powerful if he was like six one.
[8733.32s -> 8737.24s]  Got to think of five, seven. Otherwise, it'd be like, you know, how can you stop this person?
[8737.24s -> 8744.78s]  Be unbeatable, unstoppable, you know, whatever. All right. What was in here? I wasn't paying
[8744.78s -> 8769.29s]  attention. That's OK. People said not to get rid of the phrenic bow. Oh, this thing's kind of
[8769.29s -> 8787.67s]  dumpy, right? Now I've got to find this shrine, wherever it is. Five fire arrows. All right.
[8787.67s -> 8803.00s]  I'll take it. That's 10 fire arrows. All right. Nice. It's the only ball that zooms in when you
[8803.00s -> 8857.05s]  use it. I think it's in here. I did it. Oh, nice. I've got four of them now. You can do that better.
[8857.05s -> 8867.18s]  I probably could, but I don't really feel like it. Where's Frank? Oh, he's up there.
[8867.74s -> 8896.30s]  It's definitely in here. It has to be right. Yeah, it's right there. All right. How are we?
[8896.30s -> 8904.38s]  Are we just not doing a vote here? Probably not. I don't think we're going to do it every time,
[8904.38s -> 8915.80s]  do we? You want to bet? You guys do? Why not? All right. Ten minutes. Ten minutes including
[8915.80s -> 8923.00s]  chest. Fine. Ten minutes including chest. From the moment that I skip and I'm able to move.
[8927.54s -> 8934.46s]  Five, five, seven. All right. Seven minutes including chest. I'm going to put my headphones
[8934.46s -> 8942.12s]  in and just shut the fuck up and do it as best as I can. Seven minutes including the chest.
[8942.12s -> 8960.73s]  What do you think? Is that a good time? Make it six? No, it's seven. Seven minutes. Oh,
[8960.73s -> 8966.63s]  I can do it. Hold on. I can run it. No, why am I running a poll? I don't know. How do I do it?
[8966.63s -> 8972.04s]  How do you do a prediction slash prediction? I actually don't. I like don't know how to do it.
[8972.04s -> 8978.17s]  I did it once. Flash prediction. Oh, okay. You're doing it. All right.
[8978.17s -> 8987.96s]  I've actually only done it one time. Oh, there we go. Okay. Somebody said they're going all in.
[8987.96s -> 9016.90s]  Oh, yeah. I'd be betting if I were you. Lock it in. Locked in. Locked in. That was fast. Yeah.
[9016.90s -> 9034.81s]  You got to be fast. Locked in. Let's go. I was too slow. Here we go. All right. It starts.
[9034.81s -> 9111.93s]  Not right. Hold on. Not yet. Not yet. Time begins. No, it's I got it. I got it.
[9112.17s -> 9195.50s]  I got this. Wait, there's like five chests in here. Oh, burn it. Burn it. Burn it. Burn it.
[9195.50s -> 9210.18s]  Burn it. Burn it. Quick. Quick. Quick. Burn it. Burn it. Burn it. Burn it. Burn it. How do I get
[9210.18s -> 9227.37s]  in there? I need a key to get in there. Where's the key? Where's the key? Where's the key? Where's
[9227.37s -> 9233.98s]  the key? I need a key to get in here. Where's the key? It's going to be one of the boxes.
[9307.27s -> 9332.33s]  That's it. I got it right. All of them. That's it. I win. Sorry, guys. Sorry. I had two minutes
[9332.33s -> 9343.21s]  to spare. I didn't miss a chest. I don't think. I got them all. Chest in the wall. Chest over there.
[9343.21s -> 9357.88s]  I got them all. Chat cheated. They showed you it was a magnet. No, that's not accurate.
[9357.88s -> 9374.70s]  Thought about that. It's not rigged. All right. Cool. So let me get back out on the road. What's
[9374.70s -> 9393.18s]  that? The mineral? Spam the magnet emote. There is no magnet emote. You. This is the referee.
[9393.18s -> 9424.98s]  Ooh. All right. Diamond. I got a diamond. I've got diamonds. Hmm. Okay. Back out to the road,
[9424.98s -> 9446.78s]  I think. Right. Back to kind of out here. Reality. Hmm. Frank too. Can't hear you. Why
[9446.78s -> 9491.37s]  not? Oh, you're far away. It's going to get back on the road. It's very good. I got to get back up.
[9491.37s -> 9516.84s]  Wait a minute. I forget this. Copas and salt. I keep hearing the reverse music. That means
[9516.84s -> 9541.11s]  it's going to be a moon, right? All right. Where are you, Frank? Go. Who are you? What's that word?
[9541.11s -> 9545.54s]  It's on the tip of my tongue, but I just can't think of it. Starts with L ends in K. What is
[9545.54s -> 9557.77s]  it though? Lurk, lick, leak or link? Uh, me? Oh, right. Yes. The Hylian champion. Or so I've heard
[9557.77s -> 9562.79s]  somewhere. That's you, right? Your link. You just pretend to not know who I was. That's kind of
[9562.79s -> 9599.30s]  weird. Wait. Nice. Stop fucking disappearing. Annoying. Frank, watch out. Frank, get out of
[9599.30s -> 9634.30s]  the way. I was going to say that was weird. All right. Now we want to go this way. Yep. Okay.
[9634.30s -> 9638.71s]  Keep going down the road. I see anything interesting. I'll stop.
[9666.62s -> 9707.75s]  That's interesting enough for me to stop. Nah. Hang a right. Yeah. I'm just going to go down
[9707.75s -> 9737.03s]  this road here. Bones. Cause then now I'm going to go yoink that way. Why is it playing this music?
[9737.03s -> 9746.65s]  This is definitely one of the- this is a bad guy right here, right? I just set a check.
[9746.65s -> 9754.01s]  Looking to buy bananas? You can. Just take a look at these fine bananas. Sure. I'll buy.
[9762.09s -> 9767.99s]  I did check. I- okay. I was right. I was literally right. I was right. I knew it. Oh,
[9767.99s -> 9793.06s]  whatever. Oh, you piece of shit. Ooh, that's pretty- wow. All right.
[9804.41s -> 9810.04s]  I mean, whatever. I'll just use this for now. He sounds like Eric Cartman.
[9810.68s -> 9822.33s]  But they're like, nah, nah, nah, these are my cheesy foods. It kind of does. Well,
[9823.05s -> 9844.58s]  I don't know what you think about that guy. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Cause if I go up this way,
[9844.58s -> 9871.82s]  I'm sure. Yeah. Surely I'll end up in the right spot, right? He's proud of himself. Yeah.
[9871.82s -> 9899.93s]  I got to get some of the lingo sometimes. What's this? Oh, I bet he's slacking off.
[9899.93s -> 9904.15s]  I mean, what's that? You're dying for some shield surfing action.
[9905.91s -> 9910.97s]  Chill out, my man. You don't need to worry about the details.
[9910.97s -> 9916.79s]  My best bud is standing over there beneath that tree. He can show you the ropes.
[9916.79s -> 9937.72s]  You're going to go up there? Yeah, why not? Finally, shield surfing gang. The shield breakers.
[9937.72s -> 9960.90s]  Yeah, this is a chat member. We're shield gang. Shield gang here. Live the experience. Okay.
[9960.90s -> 9966.82s]  The night shield is perfect for shredding. I already have one. Isn't that what I have right
[9966.82s -> 9980.47s]  now? This is perfect for shredding. Do I have to buy one? Or am I just going to just leave?
[9989.86s -> 10020.81s]  Should I just buy it? Just shred. I have to buy one? Well, I have no room. Stop talking.
[10020.81s -> 10029.54s]  You keep standing in the same spot. What? I talked to him. I just, I'm, he's saying buy a shield.
[10029.54s -> 10068.47s]  Oh, lie down the west of here. All right, let's go. Let's shred it up. How do I do it? ZL jump A.
[10068.47s -> 10104.28s]  That's B. Right. Jump. Cool. That it? Thanks for the tip.
[10104.28s -> 10130.15s]  There's nothing better than the generic rock song. I love the generic rock song.
[10130.15s -> 10134.55s]  That didn't, it's a, and usually it's, when it's on, it's on the piano or regular piano,
[10134.55s -> 10139.02s]  not a keyboard. They're like, done, done, done, done, done, done, done, done, done, done, done.
[10139.02s -> 10146.04s]  Aren't you 40? No, not yet, but soon. I don't know what you want me to say.
[10146.92s -> 10167.78s]  All right, let's go. So we get the tower. Wait, that's a weird rock.
[10167.78s -> 10190.82s]  Oh my God. Don't scare me like that. I know I did the red dead joke already,
[10190.82s -> 10197.56s]  but I want to just look at him and go. Oh, you're ugly. Hey, I'm just kidding with you.
[10199.69s -> 10206.49s]  You know, you look like a dumb son of a gun. I'm just playing around with you.
[10207.69s -> 10213.48s]  Why are you being so serious? I do it every time. Wait, what's that?
[10214.44s -> 10233.11s]  A stick. You don't like the water, do you? All right. You're good. Very nice job. You're,
[10233.11s -> 10258.01s]  look out. I thought he was going to get hit right in the head. He's going to drown. No, he's not.
[10258.01s -> 10274.86s]  He's fine. He's not being attacked by a wild animal, right? No, he's, Frank's fine. There's
[10274.86s -> 10294.49s]  a weirdo over there though. I'm kind of concerned about that. All right. He's, he's fine. Ooh,
[10294.49s -> 10304.84s]  this is stable. Cool. All right. Place your bets. Seven minutes to get the chest as well. I mean,
[10304.92s -> 10353.02s]  I can't win every time, right? Wait, what is that? What's the point of this? What does it do? What
[10353.02s -> 10378.41s]  should I do with it? Why can I pick this up? It's weird. What purpose? What is the charge?
[10378.41s -> 10398.04s]  I don't know. Does it matter? Do I have to do anything with this? I don't get it.
[10398.76s -> 10412.42s]  I don't get it. I'll come back later. It's all right. Come back later. All right. Are we betting
[10412.42s -> 10421.75s]  or what? Seven minutes and chest. That's locked in. All right. That's pretty 50, 50, really.
[10421.75s -> 10434.31s]  Seven minutes with the chest. That's a locked in. Let's go. There's nothing in there. I had to
[10434.31s -> 10477.29s]  replace it. All right. So that time begins. Not yet. Okay. All right. All right. All right. Chest,
[10477.29s -> 10496.92s]  sledgehammer. Okay. What do we got? What do we got? What do we got? What do we got? What do we got?
[10496.92s -> 10506.39s]  What's that do? All right. It goes. What did that do? Okay. It didn't, I don't know. It didn't do
[10506.39s -> 10513.14s]  anything. What did that do? What's that sound? I hear like ding. What's that mean? Okay. Let's
[10513.14s -> 10520.07s]  throw this and see what happens. Okay. Now what? Okay. It makes, it makes a new one. I got it. Okay.
[10520.07s -> 10529.35s]  So what do we do now? We need to, we need, we, but we're all in this. All of us. We, I say we.
[10529.35s -> 10543.48s]  What are we going to do? Okay. We are going to, um, what do you mean? No, no, it's we. Oh, I say we.
[10544.12s -> 10574.17s]  I'm going to, I don't know. Ice. I'm going to do ice. Um, that you actually do football. You
[10574.17s -> 10576.89s]  actually do have to do the football. All right. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.
[10595.06s -> 10634.90s]  Shit. Okay. Um, yeah. Is that it? Is that not it? This is another one. Or is it another one?
[10634.90s -> 10643.62s]  I don't know. Um, wait. Okay. All right. All right. I get it. I know what to do. I know what to do.
[10643.62s -> 10660.30s]  Watch this. I get it. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. Ready? Oh, I know too. All right.
[10660.30s -> 10663.10s]  That would have killed me. I would have just died. I thought you had to ride on it. I thought you
[10663.10s -> 10680.07s]  had to ride on top of it. Okay. We're good. Oops. I just, ow, my fingernail. Okay. I win.
[10680.07s -> 10684.30s]  Imagine if I rode on top of that and just got splatted against the wall. That actually
[10684.30s -> 10688.82s]  would have been really funny. You didn't get the chest? What do you mean? What? What? What do you
[10688.82s -> 10704.42s]  mean not yet? What? What is the chest in here? I didn't get it. Wait. So I gotta get back in.
[10704.42s -> 10712.57s]  Where is it? Don't tell me. Okay. Hold on. I'll get it. All right. Four minutes. Three minutes.
[10712.57s -> 10720.47s]  All right. Speedrun strategy. Loading screens don't count, right? They like speed runs pause
[10720.47s -> 10731.72s]  the timer pauses until you get control of the character back, right? There's a chest in here
[10731.72s -> 10798.47s]  that I didn't get. What? Where did that go? Are you fucking kidding me? Oh, good. Fast. That was
[10798.47s -> 10808.12s]  fast. That was super. That was fast as fuck. All right. Where's the chest? Where is it? Where's the
[10808.12s -> 10824.49s]  chest? Where's the chest? Where's the chest? I don't see anything. I don't see a chest anywhere.
[10824.49s -> 10904.87s]  I don't know. I don't know where it is. This shit's hidden in a fucking wall somewhere.
[10904.87s -> 10930.09s]  Oh, I don't understand. Is that one there? Then wait a minute. What if I do this? Hold on. I got
[10930.09s -> 10940.39s]  an idea. It's probably inside. It's inside of this. Is it? I don't know. Is it inside? It's inside of
[10940.39s -> 10956.86s]  this thing. I have to smash it against the wall. It's inside. That's all right. I lose. Where is it?
[10956.86s -> 10967.16s]  Where is this chest that's apparently here somewhere? Magnet. Magnet. Yeah, but magnet. What?
[10967.72s -> 10991.11s]  Magnet? I don't see anything here. Hold on. Wait. Can I have... Can I hit... Wait a minute. This is
[10991.11s -> 11019.90s]  gonna move now. Okay. Then you move it down and that unlocks the next thing. Wait. What? What is
[11019.90s -> 11062.25s]  it? Where is this? Well, I got it. All right. Let him out. No. Look at the direction I'm facing. Why
[11062.25s -> 11131.67s]  would it do that? Dude. No. You idiot. You idiot. Oh my God. It's gonna be faster than that. This
[11131.67s -> 11201.83s]  thing's gonna break. Oh my God. It's so close. It's the one right below the maximum. This thing's
[11201.83s -> 11261.91s]  gonna break and then I'll be left with nothing. Oh, what the fuck? How many times? One, two,
[11262.47s -> 11343.37s]  three, four, five, six. Five times? Shoot it with an arrow? Stupid asshole. Oh my God.
[11343.37s -> 11422.47s]  Oh my God. Just look forward. All right. Here we go. Ready? What the fuck? I'm gonna break all my
[11422.47s -> 11452.31s]  weapons, man. All my weapons are gonna break. I'm gonna break every weapon. Hold Y? Yeah. When I
[11452.31s -> 11469.40s]  hold Y, I do this barbarian spin and I can't get the right angle. Dude. Hold Y? What are you talking
[11469.40s -> 11483.74s]  about, man? Stand still? You can't stand still. Look. Oh, you can stand still. You can stand still.
[11483.74s -> 11487.62s]  All right. Time that person up for an hour. I don't want to be looked... I don't want to time
[11487.62s -> 11509.37s]  the person up for five minutes. I don't, I don't, I don't get it. How many, how many hits should I
[11509.37s -> 11538.79s]  do with the spin? Seven? Seven. Do all of them. I'm out of weapons. I don't want to, I don't want to
[11538.79s -> 11574.04s]  break my weapons. Everything's... I broke another one. Oh yeah. It's gotta be good. I thought I was
[11574.04s -> 11578.44s]  gonna get like a light sword, like a lightsaber, like a light sword. What the fuck? That was,
[11578.44s -> 11599.26s]  what is that word? Not even worth it. It is good. Those are rare. Okay. Well, that was fun. It's
[11599.26s -> 11618.49s]  actually a good item. Giant ancient corp hog. If it actually is worth it, then that's cool.
[11618.49s -> 11654.22s]  Just warp to the shrine. Teleport. Wait. Oh, I can just leave. Where's he going? What does he look
[11654.22s -> 11671.74s]  like this? Why do people ask that every day? People ask that question every single day.
[11671.74s -> 11674.86s]  Hey, why does he look like this, man? I don't know. Why do you look like you?
[11675.90s -> 11696.39s]  Why do you look like that? Okay. So let's get back on the road. I'll figure that puzzle out later.
[11701.83s -> 11714.01s]  I have my elephant recovery. Do that now. Do the puzzle now. I don't even know what to do.
[11714.01s -> 11723.85s]  How can I do a puzzle now? Oh, okay. I'm good. I can't, how am I supposed to do it now? Figure
[11723.85s -> 11729.94s]  it out. I don't know what it wants me to do. Do what now? All right. Fine. I'll do it now.
[11737.61s -> 11745.18s]  Nice tuber reaction. Figure it. I'm gonna drown because somebody was calling me a name in chat
[11745.18s -> 11755.90s]  and I looked at it. All right. I have stamina, right? I just don't want to drown. I don't think
[11755.90s -> 11771.42s]  I have any stamina food. I think it's over. It's over. I'm gonna drown here. All right. So
[11771.42s -> 11789.64s]  what do you want me to do now? So this is a puzzle. Figure it out. It's a puzzle. I mean,
[11789.64s -> 11796.60s]  I think I understand what it wants me to do. Let's see if it's as simple as I think it is.
[11805.72s -> 11841.75s]  Like a better camera angle, please. You don't just connect it. I figured it was like one,
[11841.75s -> 11848.70s]  two, three, four, right? You connect it, connect them all. That has to be what you do. What the
[11848.70s -> 11863.18s]  hell is with this before? Can I push it? Okay. That's not what you do. So I guess it's a little
[11863.18s -> 11885.66s]  more complicated. Are there any instructions on it? Yes. I know it's a magnet. I understand it's a
[11885.66s -> 11921.82s]  magnet. Yes. I currently am using a magnet. I put it through it. I didn't work. I put it through.
[11921.82s -> 11929.78s]  I did a field goal and it didn't work. What even is that? I don't even know what that is.
[11929.78s -> 11953.40s]  Do I have to swim through it? Wait, there's another one over here.
[12022.10s -> 12036.74s]  Was it a typewriter? What is that? What email is this? Copy this. Copy this. Copy this. I don't
[12036.74s -> 12050.41s]  know what I copy. Like I have to copy it. Copy this. Copy this. I don't know how do I copy it?
[12050.97s -> 12069.75s]  There's no such thing as copy. Should we free them? Yeah, let them out. Let them out. I don't
[12069.75s -> 12079.11s]  know. I can't do it. I don't understand it. I don't get it. Copy this. It's a really good hint.
[12079.11s -> 12095.99s]  Copy. Copy. Copy this. Do I have to match the other one? But the other one already is. Looks
[12095.99s -> 12107.53s]  like that. Where did it go? Yeah, the one already. Oh, wait a minute. That doesn't.
[12107.53s -> 12122.49s]  Oh, wait. Hold on. Oh, okay. Oh, okay. Uh huh. I dropped that fucking cube on the ground 30
[12122.49s -> 12142.87s]  times over here and it didn't land in that spot. I desperately tried to put it down like five times.
[12142.87s -> 12151.19s]  You're stupid. Yeah. Oh, you got to copy the one under there. How would you know that? You didn't
[12151.19s -> 12162.57s]  know that. You went to, you went to, uh, you, you went to the extra life dot breath of the wild dot
[12162.57s -> 12176.54s]  whatever. And you had to look it up. This is the single most infuriating thing I've ever watched in
[12176.54s -> 12184.01s]  my entire life. How is Jerma a functioning human? Cause I didn't see, I didn't see the puzzle
[12184.01s -> 12203.48s]  underground. Okay. If, if a live streamer not doing a puzzle correct is the most worst thing
[12203.48s -> 12218.25s]  you've ever seen in your life. Whoa. Whoa. That's the worst thing ever you've ever seen.
[12220.98s -> 12233.96s]  Holy shit. It started raining. I, it's raining. I can't see shit. It's the second worst thing I've
[12233.96s -> 12243.72s]  ever seen. You didn't know where to put the, you didn't know how to take the cube from that place
[12243.72s -> 12249.80s]  and put it where the cube goes. How do you put your pants on every day? It's impossible. You know
[12249.80s -> 12254.04s]  what? Look, they're on, they're on and they're tied correctly. I know how to tie my shoes too.
[12254.60s -> 12273.94s]  To be fair, they didn't have 21,000 chat chimpanzees throwing coffee machines at them.
[12273.94s -> 12313.35s]  All right. So let me upgrade my gear. All right. Shields, definitely shields. I don't know how to
[12313.35s -> 12357.29s]  tie my pants. It's not hard. Hmm. Again, I think again, two shields. Weapon is three or four. Hey
[12357.29s -> 12360.82s]  Jerma, if you're getting stressed by these comments, it's a cigarette joke. Nevermind. All
[12360.82s -> 12371.72s]  right. What do we got? We keep going. A weapon is three or four. Okay. I'm going to save it
[12371.72s -> 12395.02s]  because I want to do weapon again. Or should it bow? We love you Jerma. We have to guide you to
[12395.02s -> 12430.73s]  victory. I'm going to figure it out. Give me a minute. All the route. Hope you enjoy the game.
[12430.73s -> 12439.43s]  Take it slow. Okay. For every, for every one person that says enjoy the game and take it slow. Don't
[12439.43s -> 12445.51s]  rush. Just take it at your pace. So it's like a one to one to how did he not finish this puzzle
[12445.51s -> 12472.02s]  in 10 seconds? Push him, push him to his limits. I don't mind you struggling with a toddler puzzle
[12472.02s -> 12478.42s]  as long as you can prove you can dodge a battle act. I just fucked that guy up. How was that? Huh?
[12480.34s -> 12493.45s]  How's that for a gamer? Put that in your, in your textbook and go and go learn. All right. Where am
[12493.45s -> 12517.83s]  I going? Wrong way. It's weird that all the CEOs of major cigarette companies hang out in Twitch
[12517.83s -> 12537.26s]  chats all day. That's so stupid. Does the road split? Should I go this way? Bad marketing.
[12540.63s -> 12544.44s]  Just imagine like a cigarette company CEO just sitting there just
[12545.88s -> 12550.98s]  like a tank top and his underwear just lying in bed. Just like, Hey, you should, um,
[12551.70s -> 12583.66s]  have you ever smoked a cigarette? Cigarette comedians. I'm just, I don't know. I'm tower,
[12583.66s -> 12592.07s]  tower, tower. All right. I'm ready. This is going to be sick. And when you couldn't read a clock.
[12592.07s -> 12600.33s]  Yeah. Cause I was wicked high. Okay. I'm sorry. What we get, you get where you want me to defend
[12600.33s -> 12608.18s]  every bonehead move in a game I've done. I happen to be a little bit on the side. I was a little bit
[12608.18s -> 12645.91s]  high at the time. I wasn't even trying to target that guy. Don't die. Holy shit. This weapon is
[12645.91s -> 12653.18s]  amazing. I don't want to break it. I will dodge your fucking acts in real life. I will. I swear
[12653.18s -> 12659.26s]  to God, I will contact some like martial artist group. And if you get, go to go into like a
[12659.26s -> 12662.70s]  martial artist studio and fucking dodge a bunch of weapons on screen. I swear to God,
[12669.48s -> 12674.60s]  I will do a, like, I, this is what would happen if I was ever like attacked by an act stream.
[12683.13s -> 12693.45s]  Wow. Oh no, that's not that don't do not spoil what the joke would be though.
[12693.45s -> 12701.45s]  Come on. Don't do that. Don't spoil the joke. Don't spoil. Do not spoil the joke.
[12701.45s -> 12717.34s]  Come on. Biting my lip. Don't spoil the joke. Please. Just wait. Just wait. Just wait.
[12720.98s -> 12724.18s]  I okay. I'm going to do this soon. I'm going to do this really soon.
[12724.82s -> 12732.23s]  This is not going to take that much time to do. So I'm going to do it very soon.
[12732.79s -> 12749.93s]  Was there a chest? Okay. I'm like, this stream is going to be, this stream is going to be funny.
[12750.73s -> 12753.61s]  No spoilers. I'm going to do it. I'm going to try to do this like this month.
[12755.29s -> 12764.84s]  It's not going to take a whole lot of time to get ready, bro. The tower. All right. Yeah.
[12787.93s -> 12793.29s]  Why did I think that it ended right there? All I saw was this and I thought it was the clip
[12795.19s -> 12809.75s]  red sky. I'll be fine. And the title of that scream is going to literally be the dodge.
[12809.75s -> 12817.91s]  The battle act scream. Okay. I don't, it doesn't need a fancy title. I don't even,
[12817.91s -> 12820.95s]  I don't need to, I need to sponsor that stream. It doesn't, I don't have to do that.
[12821.75s -> 12827.27s]  I mean, maybe it'd be kind of funny. I don't know. I'm into this now. I swear to God, I'm going to
[12827.27s -> 12841.83s]  make it. I'm going to scheme. It's going to be such a fucking scheme. I can't wait. All right.
[12841.83s -> 12849.70s]  That's literally, I'm not going to say anything else. All right. I got to just wait because the
[12849.70s -> 12863.61s]  blood moon is going to happen, right? And they're going to respond anyways. They're going to respond
[12863.61s -> 12908.12s]  anyways. Just whatever. I'll, I'll tell the mods. I was typing. I was typing to the whatever. Okay.
[12908.12s -> 12926.20s]  I just, what, what just happened? Is it, I'm very confused. Why is it raining meteors? Is this water
[12926.20s -> 12942.28s]  boiling? Who is doing this? Okay. Where, this guy's annoying. This guy's really annoying.
[12942.28s -> 12963.35s]  This guy's fucking annoying. Okay. Hold on. Can you be in a spot where I can actually fucking hit you
[12963.35s -> 12996.20s]  with a weapon? Oh my God. Give me that thing. Fuck away from me. Ooh. I'll take the fire rod.
[12996.20s -> 13013.70s]  Annoying dick. Okay. So is this thing boiling? I think this is burning hot. That's why, right?
[13017.77s -> 13027.22s]  Oh, it's quicksand. Okay. You just die if you're going. All right. So now I get it. So I can't go
[13027.22s -> 13072.55s]  that way. How do I not have a weapon equipped? See you later. Goodbye. See you later. Hmm.
[13072.55s -> 13085.38s]  Would ice actually work here? Is this technically water? Okay. I thought it was sludge or something.
[13131.61s -> 13168.06s]  One regular arrow. I don't think I can make this jump. Don't you fucking dare. Oh my God. I panicked
[13168.06s -> 13193.00s]  so much from that guy shooting at me. I'm going to just electrify the fucking whole thing. Just
[13193.00s -> 13200.44s]  get out of here. Little shit head. No, don't, don't. If you fire at me, I will be very upset.
[13200.44s -> 13251.88s]  Don't even think about it. Okay. Now I can do this in peace. Chest over there. Remember the
[13251.88s -> 13257.16s]  cigarette CEOs are winning. Don't let them win. Every time you see somebody write about a cigarette
[13257.16s -> 13263.08s]  in the chat, I want you to write extra lettuce or something. No. What's like a healthy thing? I don't
[13263.08s -> 13279.02s]  know. Exercise regularly. Yeah. All right. So I need to go over that. Is there anything else over
[13279.02s -> 13292.41s]  here? What is, what's that for? That'd be a reason, right? What's this here? This is a weird thing.
[13292.41s -> 13324.84s]  Just be sitting right here. Ooh. I'll take that. Sleeping. This thing's broken anyways. So just
[13324.84s -> 13353.22s]  drop it. Wasn't it a Knight's bow in there? Okay. I'm going to head back there. Ooh. Can I even break
[13353.22s -> 13406.84s]  this though? Oh wait, I have bombs. Hell yeah. Power time. Woodland power. Okay. Can I just climb
[13406.84s -> 13447.34s]  it? I think so. All right. Find out something up there too. I can't wait for this stream. It's all
[13447.34s -> 13477.90s]  I can think about right now. Am I going to make it? I don't think so. Dude. What? That's impossible.
[13477.90s -> 13496.66s]  I fell in the pixel perfect place to die. This has got to be a different hold on. I have to just
[13496.66s -> 13511.54s]  climb this. I don't think I can even make it. I don't have stamina. Wait, drink a climb potion.
[13511.54s -> 13516.02s]  You wouldn't have been able to do that if you tried to do that. You genuinely would not have
[13516.02s -> 13519.54s]  been able to do what I just did if you tried to like a hundred times over and over again. It's
[13521.05s -> 13539.30s]  honest to God. I don't think you'd be able to do that. You can't throw shit, right? You can.
[13545.13s -> 13550.73s]  What? I thought the rock boomerang didn't hit me. I thought the rock boomerang didn't hit me.
[13551.53s -> 13562.76s]  It's you. Oh my God. No. Oh my God. I just got the full heal thing. I'm okay. I'm fucking done.
[13646.71s -> 13685.38s]  Jerma's not here anymore. My name is extra lettuce. He's smoking a cigarette under the shirt.
[13743.69s -> 13792.50s]  Did I get? Did I do it? I hear the music. Nice. Nice. New area unlocked. I don't know. I don't
[13792.50s -> 13824.76s]  know about. I can see stinks in there. I had to come out. Okay. So we're that's cool. I'm kidding.
[13824.76s -> 13831.61s]  I smell fine. All right. So this is a great Hyrule forest. Weird. Let me actually take a quick look.
[13841.85s -> 13860.12s]  You want to know what I actually smell like? Let's see. Uh, cigarettes. Oh yeah. I'm sorry.
[13860.12s -> 13871.48s]  Lettuce. Don't smoke cigarettes. Seriously. Don't smoke cigarettes. Don't. Don't do it. Eat. Get
[13871.48s -> 13876.92s]  healthy and exercise and eat radishes and shit and like drink water and you know, whatever,
[13876.92s -> 13881.32s]  but don't, don't smoke cigarettes. It's really not good, but you know, you're going to do what
[13881.32s -> 13887.82s]  you're going to do. I can't stop you, but don't if you can, but you try to quit, you know, or reduce.
[13892.65s -> 13909.35s]  What the fuck is that? What is this? What the fuck is this? This is an AI image.
[13909.35s -> 13916.04s]  They just, okay, I need to show this. They extended that image with AI. That's insane.
[13925.18s -> 13956.20s]  Why is this a thing? What does this mean? What does this mean? What does this mean? What?
[13958.81s -> 13978.12s]  That's what I'm holding down here. Is it a Nintendo Wii back there? It's a fortune teller.
[13979.27s -> 14003.00s]  It looks like you're about to do an alt. Oh my God. Are those my legs? Are these my legs on the
[14003.00s -> 14032.78s]  right? Am I sitting with like jeans on? No, no, no, no. I'm in like a beanbag chair. Oh my God.
[14032.78s -> 14043.42s]  Post-apocalyptic human lettuce mutant. You're bigger than the chair. I didn't even look. What?
[14051.99s -> 14063.24s]  What the shit? I don't understand. I think I'm sitting in a beanbag chair.
[14063.24s -> 14069.42s]  Why is there a Wii? I mean, there is, there is a Wii. There is a Wii. So that's actually there.
[14069.42s -> 14093.99s]  Okay. Let me take a look. There's some shrines probably out here. I don't see any shrines
[14093.99s -> 14117.59s]  actually. Hello? Are we good? I hope so. I don't see anything. I don't think there's any shrines
[14117.59s -> 14132.46s]  that way. Go back here. Hard to tell. Okay. Cool. I can go up that way. Can I get up there that way?
[14135.22s -> 14157.94s]  Okay. Climb up one. Climb the skull. Climb the skull. Climb the skull. I missed it.
[14163.29s -> 14185.21s]  I just want to see what's over here. I can always teleport. Oh wow. That's cool. Go to the woods. I
[14185.21s -> 14197.34s]  will. I just want to see what's over here. Stop rushing me in my playthrough. Derma, you're not
[14197.34s -> 14208.25s]  doing puzzles fast enough. Derma, climb the skull. This is my playthrough. I'm going to go where I
[14208.25s -> 14228.73s]  want to go. You got your playthrough. I get my, it's my playthrough and I want macaroni and cheese
[14228.73s -> 14253.82s]  for dinner and an egg. Just one cooked. No, I want McDonald's. My playthrough. I get to decide what
[14253.82s -> 14287.67s]  food I have to. Baby. Spoiled. Ow. What happened? Oh, it's heat. Put it out. Okay. So this is made
[14287.67s -> 14303.51s]  out of wood. So get rid of it. Ooh. Go fight already. Am I just going to get burned if I walk
[14303.51s -> 14312.57s]  over here though? Does this hurt? Okay. The air hurts. So hold on. I specifically made food for
[14312.57s -> 14335.70s]  this exact purpose. Although my brain's itching. Okay. So this is 10 minutes of fire proof. Is
[14335.70s -> 14358.04s]  this a good idea? Yeah. You can swim in the lava. Yeah. All right. What else is on fire? Something's
[14358.04s -> 14367.30s]  burning. Oh, it's me. Oh, yikes. It's me. Right? Come on. I've seen this episode a million times.
[14369.30s -> 14377.86s]  How do I, does it matter? I'm just going to try to get over there or whatever.
[14383.77s -> 14419.70s]  Ooh. Crunchies. Put the bow away. I switched the bow. What? Ice rod. Now I'm decked out. Okay.
[14419.70s -> 14433.24s]  I'm here. Cool. Should I grab anything? I think I have to just get up here, right? You're in the
[14433.24s -> 14438.86s]  volcano for fuck's sake. I know. Dude, I'm trying to figure out how to get in here. I'm on a time
[14438.86s -> 14451.85s]  limit. I can't really stick around. Yeah. What's that? Water. I hear water. Oh Lord. Okay. I don't
[14451.85s -> 14470.44s]  have much time. Um, I wonder if there's a place where I'm safe from the fire or something. Whoa.
[14470.44s -> 14488.82s]  What is this? Yep. Hold on. I don't have time to explore that. How do I go? Um, where should I go?
[14488.82s -> 14528.10s]  I don't know. I'm just going to keep going this way. Where's your flame guard?
[14528.10s -> 14592.92s]  Unk. Oh, really? Where? Where is it? Oh, it's a chameleon. How am I going to actually be able
[14592.92s -> 14612.12s]  to get up there in 10 minutes? That's a good question. Oh, hey, what's up? What's going on
[14612.12s -> 14620.12s]  city? All right. Cool. Well, looky here. Welcome master link. How did you know? What do you mean?
[14620.12s -> 14625.19s]  More importantly, I hope you made it past all those magma bombs without injury. To be honest,
[14625.19s -> 14628.07s]  we haven't had many visitors here since those magma bombs started falling from the sky.
[14629.21s -> 14634.09s]  I'd be bored to tears if I didn't pass the time pretending to greet the long lost Hylian champion.
[14634.09s -> 14640.55s]  Heh. Oh, in case you didn't know, uh, link is the little Hylian who fought alongside the
[14640.55s -> 14645.54s]  Goron champion Daruk. You want to hear more? Talk to the boss. He lives further in town.
[14646.18s -> 14653.72s]  Am I safe in here? No, it's like a million degrees. I didn't mean, did I hit you with that?
[14654.44s -> 14667.99s]  Am I actually, uh, well, I die in six minutes. Maybe I can buy like a flame suit from town here.
[14667.99s -> 14690.81s]  I bet you I can. I'd be shocked if you couldn't. Who sells this armor? That blasted Rudania.
[14690.81s -> 14695.83s]  With Rudania running wild recently, Death Mountain's eruptions have gotten real bad.
[14696.55s -> 14703.05s]  Do you see Rudania stomping around up there on the mountain? They say that a hundred years ago,
[14703.05s -> 14708.02s]  it actually used to protect our people from harm. But that was then and this is now. Now all it does
[14708.02s -> 14712.02s]  is mess up our mining operations. We're all suffering because it's stopping us from doing
[14712.02s -> 14719.90s]  business. Can't tell you how many times we've used the cannon to chase off that fiend. But it
[14719.90s -> 14730.71s]  always comes back. Oh. Ouch. Ow. Just some back pain. Wait, who are you? I see. So then you came
[14730.71s -> 14736.01s]  all this way to pay your respects to me. I like you already, brother. Well, my name's Bluto.
[14737.02s -> 14743.02s]  I'm the great Goron boss who's fearsome enough to silence a crying child or to make a silent child
[14743.02s -> 14750.92s]  cry either way. Yes, it's none other than I, Bluto. I was planning on a drive off Rudania,
[14750.92s -> 14758.39s]  like I always do. But then this blasted pain in my back flared up out of nowhere. Blasted
[14758.39s -> 14765.11s]  Yunovo. When will he return? Yunovo is a young Goron who helps me drive off
[14765.11s -> 14773.02s]  Rudania. He went to grab some painkillers from my back room out of the abandoned North Mine.
[14773.58s -> 14784.33s]  Really hasn't come back yet. Slacker. I bet. Hey, I'm gonna see Yunovo. Let him know I'm looking for
[14785.69s -> 14804.84s]  Goku. Ah, oh ouch. Okay. I need to buy armor. He said the thing. Oh, yay. He said it.
[14810.84s -> 14823.03s]  That's the one thing I have not retired, right? I keep doing the Mr. Satan. I just won't stop it.
[14824.71s -> 14844.20s]  Okay, there is, okay, right here. I got a lot of money. Should be good, right? Okay.
[14852.10s -> 14861.53s]  Oh, right. Here we go. All right. Flame Breaker Armor. It's made fire-resistant rocks to protect
[14861.53s -> 14875.34s]  the wear. How much is it? 600? I need it. Cool. Now, what about the other stuff? Flame Guard sits
[14875.34s -> 14884.92s]  700. If I just have one piece, is that okay? Would you need the whole set? I need the whole set. No
[14884.92s -> 14904.17s]  way. I have a lot of gems. I should probably go upgrade it too though, right? I need at least two.
[14904.81s -> 14912.41s]  Two out of three will protect you. Okay. What's the cheapest one? I probably should get the pants
[14913.05s -> 14943.02s]  and upgrade it. The one piece is real. Okay. This is 2000. What? Why is that so expensive?
[14945.13s -> 14963.02s]  Excuse me? I need to go to the forest area and upgrade this. This is a three armor. Are you
[14963.02s -> 14974.26s]  kidding me? That's terrible. Yeah, I'm getting out of here. I do need to get to a shrine first,
[14975.06s -> 14982.14s]  which I think is probably one here. I'm not staying. I need to find the shrine so I can
[14982.14s -> 15005.42s]  teleport back here. You need the helmet. Where's the shrine? Above? I need a place to teleport to
[15006.06s -> 15060.63s]  because I can't teleport to over here yet. The shrine. You don't need the helmet. You only need
[15060.63s -> 15088.62s]  one piece. The one piece is real, I suppose. What's this? God damn it. Don't just get rid of it.
[15088.94s -> 15111.00s]  Look at that up there. I'm trying to find the shrine. I'm going up here. It's definitely up.
[15111.00s -> 15187.26s]  Has to be. You stupid Mega Man enemy. I hate those things. Where is it? Can I move this?
[15187.26s -> 15235.80s]  Let's go. That was fun. There it is. Yes. Shrine time. What do we think? Seven minutes with the
[15235.80s -> 15251.37s]  chest. Hello? What was that? Oh, it's you. Seven minutes with the chest. I think that sounds pretty
[15251.37s -> 15280.70s]  good. So to me, I didn't touch anything. I was resting my leg. I got the armor. It's on right
[15280.70s -> 15300.28s]  now. Look. He's looking right at me. I didn't like that. That was weird. All right. Get it in.
[15300.28s -> 15311.77s]  Let's go. You know the deal. Right when I get control of the character. One second. Go. Get
[15311.77s -> 15322.98s]  those bets in. I'm going to concentrate. I'm not going to talk. Here we go. Get them in. What is
[15322.98s -> 15376.81s]  it? Here we... I need fire. I need fire. Make our own. Okay. All right. Chest. Stone. Holy shit. Is
[15376.81s -> 15412.78s]  that 42 damage? Goodness. This thing is insane. Okay. I got that. Now we need to burn something.
[15412.78s -> 15465.37s]  All right. I don't know why I did that, but I did it. Guardian sword. Chest. Okay. That's two chests
[15465.37s -> 15507.21s]  down. Take a look over here. I know what to do about this. I think. Uh huh. Nevermind. Go this
[15507.21s -> 15526.94s]  way. Key. I need a key. This place is huge. How am I ever going to do this in seven minutes?
[15526.94s -> 15548.98s]  This place is enormous, guys. How was I supposed to ever do this? Why did I just do that?
[15548.98s -> 15560.78s]  Whatever. This place is enormous. It's enormous. There's no way I was going to get this done.
[15560.78s -> 15581.19s]  Not a chance in hell. Don't. Congratulations to everybody. This is the longest dungeon I've done
[15581.19s -> 15606.09s]  so far. Don't roll off. What is stopping? Stay here. Don't fucking move. I didn't know you could
[15606.09s -> 15668.87s]  even do that. Okay. Now. All right. I got the right idea. Whatever. Fuck it. I got the right
[15668.87s -> 15680.47s]  idea. You might as well pay out the people that bet against it because there's no way I'm going
[15680.47s -> 15724.10s]  to do this. Wait. I don't even need to do that anymore. Hold on. Oops. Okay. Cool. Key. Wait a
[15724.10s -> 15732.15s]  minute. How much time? What do I have? Time? What's my time? What's my time? What's my time?
[15732.15s -> 15797.40s]  What's my time? Not even close. Congratulations. You won. What does this do? Okay. I can't grab
[15797.40s -> 15837.35s]  that. No. What? Why did it want me to come down? What was it for? What was that even for? Okay.
[15837.35s -> 15845.85s]  Do I need to do anything else over there? I mean I need to get the barrel. I'm just going to burn
[15845.85s -> 15861.61s]  it but I can't like yank it. I mean technically I could. Does this work? Can I just break it?
[15861.61s -> 15875.48s]  I could hit it with a sword or something. Arrows? I could just shoot it with a fire arrow. I don't
[15875.48s -> 15881.93s]  have any arrows. I mean I'm just going to. Will the bomb work? Does the bomb cause fire? I don't
[15881.93s -> 15905.83s]  think I've ever tested this. Okay that worked. Oh my god. It was literally right here. So many
[15905.83s -> 15912.39s]  people are probably just going like just shoot it. Shoot it with a fucking arrow. Just screaming
[15912.39s -> 15920.95s]  and they lost all their points. I'm sitting here like oh puzzle. Okay so like oh oh yeah put that
[15920.95s -> 15948.31s]  over there. Oh yeah then move that and no that's I just shoot with an arrow. Dude you suck. Hey
[15949.40s -> 15958.36s]  close it. Close this. Close this. I don't want to hear it. I don't want to. I don't even want to
[15958.36s -> 15974.22s]  hear it. Pay him up. Pay him up. Pay him up. You over thought that so much. Yep I don't know. I
[15974.22s -> 15977.42s]  think it's like oh it's a puzzle. I gotta be careful. What if I get it wrong and chat goes oh
[15979.02s -> 15982.78s]  I'm just I don't know. I'm thinking about people thinking I'm stupid and then I just don't shoot
[15982.78s -> 15999.74s]  it with an arrow. Did I get the chest? I got all the chests right? So I have a teleport now. Wait
[15999.74s -> 16007.72s]  let me let me check over here. You just killed those birds. I didn't. You are a monster.
[16008.36s -> 16024.15s]  All right I promise I wouldn't scream today. Hello. So many people out and about. You should
[16024.15s -> 16033.22s]  know it gets much harder past here. There are also lots of monsters. It's dangerous. This is
[16033.22s -> 16041.51s]  the abandoned north mine. Oh and this is the little ditty we all used to sing as we worked.
[16041.51s -> 16049.27s]  Ammo goes boom till ore fills the room. Gather said ore for rupees galore. Dig all day to get
[16049.27s -> 16072.47s]  the good pay. That's a pretty good song. Oh there's more. You get the idea. You gotta put your
[16072.47s -> 16084.58s]  stand up. You gotta put your hands up. What stranger like you asking about Unobo? The boss
[16084.58s -> 16093.66s]  wants to know. What? Okay. I went to the vault to fetch some painkillers but now that you mentioned
[16093.66s -> 16105.66s]  it I suppose he never came back. It's dangerous. Don't go looking for him. Okay. Vine beast va
[16105.66s -> 16113.13s]  Rudania. All right. Cool cool cool cool cool cool cool. All right I need to get the heck out of
[16113.13s -> 16130.81s]  here because I want to upgrade the the gear. That was where? Down here right? No no no no no.
[16130.81s -> 16161.96s]  Over here? Right here right? Pagariko yep. Did you already add germa turtle? That was quick. Oh from
[16161.96s -> 16168.68s]  when I started singing to when the singing stopped I lost 400 sub. I'm just kidding I made
[16168.68s -> 16196.18s]  that up. I made it up. I'm kidding. So what does it take to upgrade this gear? I wonder. What am I
[16196.18s -> 16225.00s]  going to be for Halloween? Um a turtle. Shit. All right I need fireproof lizards. What do I get
[16225.00s -> 16235.64s]  those? Did I ever take a picture of those? Aren't they kind of just running around outside? You said
[16235.64s -> 16250.33s]  you're going to be a pineapple. They're all okay so I gotta go back there. Buy more from beetle?
[16250.33s -> 16269.51s]  Okay. I've seen them run around as they catch them. How much longer are you going to stream for?
[16270.31s -> 16276.76s]  Um I don't know. Maybe like an hour or two. I definitely will at the very least get inside of
[16276.76s -> 16284.10s]  the divine beast area right? Okay looking for lizards. If I see a lizard I want to take a
[16284.10s -> 16323.67s]  picture of it. Get the camera ready. Lizards. I'm just looking. I'm just scanning the ground.
[16323.67s -> 16428.70s]  I'm just trying to see if I can see any. See any? That didn't count. There we go. Nice. Okay. What
[16428.70s -> 16472.49s]  the fuck? All right. How many do I need? I need 12. That's a lot. Oh I don't want to watch that.
[16472.49s -> 16512.90s]  Uh okay down here. I don't okay. I can't go there. You're gonna scare the fish. Get out of here. I
[16512.90s -> 16658.46s]  don't see one. Oh wait right here? No. How many do I need? Two or three or four? Just two? I need
[16658.46s -> 16668.81s]  nine more. I don't have the materials to even make it. You only need two with your current
[16668.81s -> 16694.12s]  upgrade kit. All right so I'm good then. Let's do two. Okay that makes sense. Do you have the
[16694.12s -> 16712.87s]  strategy guide open on another monitor? Uh dude shut up. Um shut up. Shut the fuck up. All right
[16712.87s -> 16761.21s]  so let's go do this. Omega lull. It's such a classic song. All right this will go to five.
[16763.34s -> 16791.51s]  It's not that much. Better than nothing. Better than nothing. Could I do this again?
[16791.83s -> 16804.42s]  Mm-hmm. Oh wait. I am so dumb. I okay. Do you know why? Because it was in the same slot. So I was
[16804.42s -> 16821.34s]  like wait I can't. No because it was literally the same spot and it moved. If you got all the
[16821.34s -> 16826.78s]  chests in a shrine there should be a chest icon near or on the shrine's map. Oh all right. That's
[16826.78s -> 16835.21s]  good to know. Do I have anything? Can I do anything else? I guess I could do this. Am I going to
[16835.21s -> 16843.99s]  utilize this again? Try to just do it while I'm here. Yeah probably. Not worth it. Oh because I
[16844.07s -> 16865.40s]  already. I mean not really. Just kind of a swimming. All right cool. Let's. I have plenty of healing.
[16865.40s -> 16876.26s]  I got tons of food and shit. So I think I'll be all right. So let me head to uh the divine beast.
[16876.26s -> 16885.70s]  See how it goes. Post the tweet draft. You know what? I think I still copy and pasted it. Let me
[16885.70s -> 16897.35s]  see. Yeah no it's yeah literally still copy. It's still on my clipboard. We were talking about the
[16897.35s -> 16901.51s]  adult happy meal that I was like wait how is that. There's an adult happy meal coming out or
[16901.51s -> 16904.07s]  something. And I was like what does that even mean? It's just a regular meal. That's what an
[16904.07s -> 16910.55s]  adult happy meal is. And we were talking about like what the hell would even be in it. And I
[16910.55s -> 16917.66s]  was going to write a tweet that said uh the adult happy meal colon one single can of Bud Light,
[16917.66s -> 16923.98s]  two cigarettes, a 10-piece nugget, and three business cards. One for a landscaping company,
[16923.98s -> 16940.92s]  one for a CPA, and one for a real estate agent. I'm gonna put it in the draft. I thought I put it
[16940.92s -> 16958.57s]  in the draft. You know I'll launder it for a while. Honestly though what is what what is in
[16958.57s -> 16968.20s]  the adult happy meal? I'm imagining a bunch of businessmen in suits going to McDonald's and
[16968.20s -> 16989.61s]  getting happy meals rather than going out for drinks. What's in it? It's so funny how this is
[16989.61s -> 16994.33s]  rated E for everyone but Mario Odyssey technically isn't because it has a tank. What? Is that real?
[16995.13s -> 17006.95s]  Dude it's just a solid gold bar. That's I don't even know that's like a funny joke I guess. But
[17006.95s -> 17010.31s]  like what are you that's like so outrageous I don't even I can't even laugh at that. Like
[17010.31s -> 17026.98s]  what is that what are you talking about? Why would there be a solid gold bar in a fucking happy meal?
[17026.98s -> 17059.35s]  Oh is there a better way to go here? Oh wait oh no no no I turn this off this is just for the
[17059.35s -> 17080.89s]  lizards right yeah okay is there a oh I can't do ice over here right I got that I didn't even
[17080.89s -> 17098.49s]  know he died okay can I do the ice cubes here oh my god was that my good one oh my goodness
[17099.62s -> 17111.94s]  no it was the shitty one thank god what the fuck just happened okay I was I can't it's hurt if I
[17111.94s -> 17149.91s]  walk in this that hurts a lot oh cool who cares though what's that what does that do for me
[17150.47s -> 17194.90s]  can I move it I didn't know that was a lever look at that that does not look like a lever

[19001.64s -> 19010.87s]  it was saying throw the torch oh but yeah I don't think I can make it from here
[19011.43s -> 19019.88s]  I can't make it from there okay I honestly did not think I could make it that far I was like this
[19019.88s -> 19025.99s]  there was no chance in my brain that that was gonna make it I didn't even want to attempt it
[19025.99s -> 19031.94s]  because it was like it's not possible like there's no way you can go that far that was just a that
[19031.94s -> 19038.17s]  was a complete thought oh throw the torch that was the first thing I thought of and it's like oh
[19038.17s -> 19043.37s]  okay no no way no chance in hell it's not possible it just physically isn't possible
[19044.09s -> 19070.81s]  but apparently it is you go okay throw the torch you guys are so funny all right well let's try it
[19070.81s -> 19090.52s]  again oh shit gamer fatigue no that's not it oh these are all lit no not gamer fatigue

[19257.90s -> 19264.41s]  and then the camera pans around and half of my other half behind me is gone it's like you just
[19264.41s -> 19305.82s]  see through everything it's like I'm cutting half this way okay let's try it again this is burning
[19305.82s -> 19318.31s]  me just die I have to do it again you have another torch I don't have any arrows go buy
[19318.31s -> 19332.86s]  arrows I'm already in here you're trending on Twitter why what I do you can teleport I know
[19332.86s -> 19367.91s]  but I have to at least prove that I'm capable of doing this one arrow Andy just buy arrows where
[19367.91s -> 19381.00s]  are they who sells them who sells them don't tell him he doesn't want to know he doesn't need to
[19381.00s -> 19393.11s]  know your forehead's big it's not it's not it just really isn't what do you know no my forehead's
[19393.11s -> 19409.54s]  not big my hairline is receding get it right okay uh who sells arrows here general store
[19409.54s -> 19427.94s]  I imagine the general store yeah I have a normal sized forehead it's just my hair is going backwards
[19428.58s -> 19456.01s]  you have arrows here you got arrows you do I want them all what are these you got these arrows I'm

[19474.18s -> 19496.84s]  quest I'll do it later Graham drops uh-oh what's your favorite piano note uh the one that sounds
[19496.84s -> 19513.82s]  like this you know the one the very end either the very end of the right side or the very end
[19513.82s -> 19521.67s]  of the left side because you just press it hard ones on the left and it's a scary noise and then
[19521.67s -> 19528.97s]  you go to the right and you do the last two notes into just one two one two one two one two and it
[19528.97s -> 19592.46s]  could be something magical or somebody sneaking along like this you know or just do the shrine
[19592.46s -> 19617.85s]  all right if I stand up am I dead I can't stand up I can't stand up I couldn't even hear what that
[19617.85s -> 19626.60s]  sounded like because I'm plugged in I'm listening to the switch audio not the desktop audio drop
[19626.60s -> 19630.76s]  the frames I know it's because I don't know for some reason every time I try to stream at eight
[19630.76s -> 19663.37s]  o'clock to nine p.m. I have issues I don't care it's fine all right we're good I am gonna eat
[19663.37s -> 19691.32s]  though very cool so let's do this imagine that's the thing to do bye and imagine if I had arrows I
[19691.32s -> 19733.93s]  would have just beat it 60 that thing is so so good uh okay two chests up here oh all right
[19733.93s -> 19751.22s]  that's cool big flame sword these are really really good items for just kind of walking up here
[19754.36s -> 19777.40s]  okay I don't have the torch anymore rate this game out of 10 I know you people keep asking me
[19777.40s -> 19838.78s]  to do that but wait oh this water spraying oh shit okay um hold on um wait hold on a second okay
[19838.78s -> 19930.31s]  all right uh well I have an idea then at the same time oh wait okay okay um okay okay
[19930.31s -> 19950.36s]  I'm gonna be streaming for windows 94 computer what does that mean we're good oh wait a minute
[19950.36s -> 19958.41s]  there's a lot of chests in this one I was never gonna do this in seven minutes
[19958.41s -> 19980.63s]  horse dweller sword I think it's time to get rid of this 22 damage it's good I'm running out of
[19980.63s -> 20014.81s]  shitty weapons to care about do not care about oh burn all right cool guardian spirit oh my
[20014.81s -> 20025.94s]  goodness I can't pick any of these up um shit I don't know what to do I guess I could get rid
[20025.94s -> 20034.58s]  of this what's better you're lagging I know it doesn't matter I I guess I'll get rid of the
[20034.58s -> 20039.53s]  get rid of the fire rod yeah it's cool but
[20039.61s -> 20062.78s]  what guardian spear ancient battleaxe 30 versus okay now this is probably it's 30 damage
[20063.42s -> 20073.66s]  everything else is good maybe get rid of the cobble crusher and pick up the
[20073.66s -> 20088.70s]  sword guardian sword is 20 versus yeah no heavy weapons suck keep whatever you like I like the
[20088.70s -> 20094.14s]  fast weapons the might you but what about mining oh you're right yeah I forgot about the mining
[20094.14s -> 20122.46s]  that's true that's true what on earth hmm this is interesting how am I gonna do this
[20122.46s -> 20164.70s]  oh shit I'm in trouble here I don't think I can make it use the sword the wooden sword I just
[20164.70s -> 20171.48s]  got it though this thing's cool this thing I'm burning this thing this thing's awesome
[20211.56s -> 20231.78s]  got it frames are dropping frames are dropping you honestly I wonder why between eight and nine
[20231.78s -> 20239.06s]  pm sometimes specific and then it's fine it's fine all day fine after I wonder what's going on
[20241.27s -> 20246.55s]  well I mean uh all the eu fans will tell me this is the great idea to just stream an hour or two
[20246.55s -> 20255.61s]  earlier that's the thing higher traffic shouldn't matter I have I have fiber I have a gigabit line
[20255.61s -> 20262.79s]  that I don't share a connection with anybody else so it shouldn't matter I don't have I don't
[20262.79s -> 20275.37s]  share like a node with a neighborhood or anything I do not share a node sorry it's me chewing on
[20275.37s -> 20296.95s]  your internet wire oh well stop a giga line yeah I'd say I have a giga chad line all right let
[20296.95s -> 20364.41s]  me move this is that correct up there that's fun I'm gonna go um turn in that main quest
[20364.97s -> 20375.05s]  yeah but it's super strange I really don't really have an answer because um technically speaking
[20375.05s -> 20381.24s]  in a technical sense it's not like oh it's peak hours you should that's it happens it shouldn't
[20381.24s -> 20388.52s]  be I like I said gigabit to I have a gigabit to the street so I don't there's no sharing of
[20388.52s -> 20396.58s]  the internet with the node or whatever um and it's perfect it's bad for like 40 minutes between like
[20396.58s -> 20409.02s]  8 20 and like 9 it's weird something with the way the traffic is hopping from like 8 pm to 9 pm
[20409.58s -> 20417.19s]  it just hates it I don't know well I don't want to get upset about it I know that I always go on
[20417.19s -> 20420.95s]  these are kind of tangents where it's like I don't know I don't know I let me I let me talk
[20420.95s -> 20424.47s]  let's talk about it again let me go over like 40 straight minutes of why the internet's not
[20424.47s -> 20443.59s]  um it's gonna play it's all right it's what it is it is what it is it'll get better okay here's
[20443.59s -> 20472.63s]  the reward that's a pretty good reward see that statue um I can't uh we can we move out of the
[20472.63s -> 20492.41s]  way oh all right back when I was in high school we literally had squirrels munch on our lines
[20493.85s -> 20497.45s]  that's so that sucks but that's like so funny for some reason
[20515.45s -> 20520.01s]  let those other champions know they better eat their gravel and want to keep up with the roof
[20521.05s -> 20529.10s]  speaking of which can you believe this you just look at all those delectable rocks sprinkled on
[20529.10s -> 20536.95s]  those mountains mighty tasty I may not know a whole lot about this calamity cannon thing
[20537.83s -> 20544.15s]  but mark my words I'll protect this land of ours to the death right little guys
[20545.75s -> 20553.51s]  they could have killed me hey by the way congrats on becoming the princess's appointed knight
[20553.51s -> 20563.11s]  that's a really big deal protecting the king's daughter no pressure seriously though the
[20563.11s -> 20569.43s]  princess is a strong personality so strong she can't quite see the range for the peaks
[20569.43s -> 20600.71s]  remember that and you'll be fine so what was I saying that was a little strange as far as I
[20600.71s -> 20609.46s]  know death mountain has been quiet for decades but if the mountain is shivering enough to send
[20609.46s -> 20613.94s]  down a bunch of boulders that size then never mind forget I said anything
[20631.37s -> 20647.21s]  it's gotten into you highly ensure our strange anyway you know but he's actually descendant of
[20647.21s -> 20656.01s]  the great Daruk okay that's why that slacker can even use Daruk's protection he's to protect
[20656.01s -> 20661.61s]  himself when we fire at rudania that's the only way we can chase that blasted beast away
[20661.61s -> 20671.00s]  we have no choice because normal cannonballs are no good against him all right that's enough
[20671.00s -> 20686.23s]  out of me time to go drive off rudania oh gosh are you okay yeah just peachy dumb traveler of
[20686.23s -> 20693.88s]  course I'm not okay oh wow I'm afraid I won't be going anywhere today I hate to put you on the
[20693.88s -> 20698.12s]  spot but can you please go tell it you know both that I'm gonna have to cancel for today
[20698.76s -> 20711.75s]  you should be at Eldon bridge Eldon bridge all right let's go to Eldon bridge Eldon bridge all
[20711.75s -> 20738.86s]  right Eldon ring cool let's do it simulation is breaking what I frames internet frames internet
[20738.86s -> 20746.55s]  you know what I mean uh should I buy some stuff before I go over here like I should purchase some
[20746.55s -> 20750.73s]  stuff or am I just ready look at all this are you kidding me look at all this shit I have
[20757.14s -> 20764.66s]  you need more arrows should I get more arrows I have 42 ice arrows I think I'm all right
[20768.81s -> 20776.25s]  I'm just gonna go for it it's the quickest way over there you can never have enough regular
[20776.25s -> 20798.86s]  arrows well I'll just buy some more then there's the uh store where is the general store all right
[20798.86s -> 20807.02s]  what do you got uh you've got you don't have regular arrows in here cane sugar um sure I'll

[20837.06s -> 20855.40s]  the best way to get up there wrap around oh wait a second here I've got guys heart or stamina
[20855.40s -> 20872.52s]  stamina I'll do stamina and heart stamina twice how much longer you're gonna scream for uh probably
[20872.52s -> 20880.94s]  be calling it very soon over the next like 10 to 15 minutes maybe I'll do two stamina now again
[20880.94s -> 20904.30s]  I just go full on stamina I'm doing it it's probably a mistake but whatever he's gonna be
