[0.70s -> 6.62s]  Why am I seeing a bunch of- Finally, crack time. Crack time, crack time. Finally, it's crack time.
[6.62s -> 15.74s]  Are you just sitting there waiting to smoke crack? Like you've got your crack on the table and your
[15.74s -> 20.54s]  crack pipe or your crack device. Are you just sitting there like a napkin is laid out in front
[20.54s -> 30.87s]  of you? Come on, come on, start the stream dude. He's late. I can't smoke this crack until he's here.
[30.87s -> 52.34s]  God damn it. Oh, live, live. Oh yeah. Yes, we have to wait. Oh, finally, crack time.
[52.34s -> 68.26s]  Anyways, how are you? Just like crack work. Yeah, we're going to play more house flipper today
[68.26s -> 74.52s]  for an undetermined amount of time. I might get bored in 30 minutes and we play Desperados 3
[74.52s -> 79.16s]  or I'll be here for another five or six straight fucking hours and then we're going to do,
[79.16s -> 91.50s]  we're just going to keep doing it. I don't know. Am I going to just sly Cooper?
[91.50s -> 104.50s]  I don't know. Sly Cooper. You got to put that in the list of games that are similar to,
[105.46s -> 113.50s]  and I know people are going to be like, did he just sit? Hold on. I put like Jack and Dexter
[114.82s -> 122.95s]  and Dexter and Jack's. What's that other one? This too. Ratchet and Clank. Ratchet and Clank,
[122.95s -> 133.75s]  Jack and Dexter. I feel like that's like a tag team fight. Okay. So that's very different.
[136.86s -> 141.50s]  Jekyll and Hyde. Take that. Say no, that you, okay. I thought you said, take that back.
[141.50s -> 151.67s]  You said, say hi back. Hey, how are you? They were competing platform mascot game. Yeah,
[152.23s -> 157.75s]  it's, I don't know. Sly Cooper just kind of fits there in my brain with like other mascot platformer
[157.75s -> 167.10s]  game. I thought you don't have a gun or anything. You don't just jump around and I only like Jack
[167.10s -> 171.98s]  one and they're all great. Hey, I know I haven't played them. I'm sure I will eventually on stream
[172.78s -> 178.38s]  and you delay the screen by five minutes. I have to enter the litter box.
[179.10s -> 184.15s]  I, it's going to probably take five minutes to go do it now and take probably five minutes
[184.15s -> 194.39s]  before I get into the game. This dude's a pathological liar. No, I'm a pathological
[194.39s -> 213.96s]  forgetter. There's a huge difference. You play PlayStation heroes. No, I haven't. That's a lie.
[216.36s -> 223.66s]  You're going to play fall guys. No, not today. Not today. I, I can't, I can't do it. I cannot
[223.66s -> 235.62s]  win. I finally pulled out of the seven 11 parking lot. That is like $42 scratch tickets. I don't
[235.62s -> 255.35s]  think I'm going to win. He's a selective pathological forgetter. You just described like
[255.91s -> 264.94s]  a patient in a Leslie Nielsen movie. What's the prognosis doctor? Oh, he's a selective
[264.94s -> 274.78s]  pathological forgetter. Interesting. Did you just who Leslie Nielsen? I want to ban that guy.
[277.18s -> 287.06s]  Are we getting a who on Leslie Nielsen? A who? A who on Leslie Nielsen? Oh boy. Do yourself a
[287.06s -> 290.98s]  favor. Just go watch every Leslie Nielsen movie from start to finish. And I'm even talking about
[290.98s -> 294.50s]  the ones that are in black and white that weren't comedies. Go watch those too. Watch them all.
[294.50s -> 305.27s]  Watch this whole catalog. He has like a hundred movies. I told that I told that person that they
[305.27s -> 316.66s]  could empty the litter box. Look, we haven't even done anything. The naked gun movies are
[317.30s -> 325.13s]  were a pretty major influence on what I think is funny. I used to watch those all the time.
[325.13s -> 351.45s]  Airplane, airplane movies, huge influences. Spaceballs, kind of the same era. I love the
[351.45s -> 363.27s]  naked gun series. It was just ridiculous. He made so much money just being the guy that was dead
[363.27s -> 368.95s]  serious in absurd situations. It was just Leslie Nielsen. It was going to look at something with
[368.95s -> 375.83s]  a stern face and be completely deadpan while a clown like honked a horn behind him. It was
[375.83s -> 387.51s]  awesome. Is that police squad show? Yeah, that was what it was before, right? No, no, no. What was
[387.51s -> 398.46s]  it was? It was naked gun was the movies based on a TV show that got canceled, right? That's the one,
[398.46s -> 414.30s]  right? That police squad was first. What are you resident sleeper? Resident sleeper.
[415.10s -> 421.59s]  Just go watch. OK, you could resident sleep for me on this topic, but go watch naked gun.
[423.05s -> 430.01s]  And I bet you that resident sleeper face turns into like a hog mouth in about 45 minutes.
[438.39s -> 442.15s]  Leslie Nielsen who naked gun resident sleeper.
[443.11s -> 451.74s]  Shit, now I'm going to be 40 soon. All right, let's go. Let's play. Welcome back, everybody.
[451.74s -> 457.54s]  Hope you're having a good day. Hey, hope you're having a good day. What does that mean? I say
[457.54s -> 461.46s]  that a lot. I think a lot of people say that, like when they broadcast and they make videos,
[461.46s -> 468.97s]  they guess hope you're having a good day. I mean, I kind of I do, but that's always the go to.
[468.97s -> 474.76s]  All right, here's the Aqua teen house because every house is a fucking cartoon house. I
[474.76s -> 479.14s]  seriously couldn't stop thinking about this. I couldn't stop thinking about this the whole
[479.14s -> 484.79s]  night of this. I didn't even want this to be a cartoon house. But like the title says,
[484.79s -> 495.10s]  it's always a cartoon house. Always a mystic quests. That's what a great name that is.
[495.10s -> 505.62s]  Mystic quests. Thanks to the five community subs. And what is this? This is a image of me.
[515.14s -> 520.07s]  OK, hold on. I thought this was. Don't ask me why.
[520.39s -> 534.97s]  I thought that was ice. I thought I was sitting in ice, like an ice bath going like, oh,
[535.93s -> 542.52s]  I saw it. It was this small when I saw it. I was like, oh, shit, like somebody made me like an
[542.52s -> 563.10s]  ice bath. It's a coke bath. No, no, we guys, we cannot. We this we cannot. We cannot.
[565.00s -> 584.90s]  What is going on? Weak to 2020. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. This is absurd.
[584.90s -> 594.17s]  I got to put this up. This is ridiculous. All right. We got up. I'm going to move on after
[594.17s -> 602.46s]  this. We got to play. Is this because I took the week off? I didn't take a week off. I took
[602.46s -> 634.14s]  two months off. Fuck. This is fucking ridiculous. OK. All right. I got to let's get grounded here.
[636.41s -> 643.75s]  Oh, he's on vacation again. I wasn't on vacation. All right. Time to get to work.
[644.31s -> 651.45s]  You guys are grounded. OK, so I have to take a wall down. I cannot. This is this can't be
[651.45s -> 662.70s]  Meatwad's room, but I have practiced the voice. OK, what are you doing? I don't want you in my
[662.70s -> 670.87s]  room. No, I don't think so. I think I want to get out of my room. I've been working on the voice as
[670.87s -> 683.05s]  of yet. It took me about four hours to get that correct. He did that yesterday. I didn't do the
[683.05s -> 687.85s]  high part. I didn't do that. What do you do? I didn't do that one yesterday. I did the low one.
[687.85s -> 701.16s]  It took me two hours in the bathtub saying that into the ceiling to get that right. But I have to
[701.16s -> 704.60s]  I can't do this. This has to change. This is I can't. This cannot be the Aqua Teen house.
[704.60s -> 712.30s]  I'm sorry. I have to get rid of this. I have to take this wall down. This cannot be an Aqua Teen
[712.30s -> 720.14s]  house. No, no, it's not happening. I don't care. All every house cannot be a cartoon house,
[720.14s -> 724.70s]  not every. It's not going to be. Oh, do Family Guy, do the Simpsons, do Aqua Teen,
[724.70s -> 732.07s]  do the American Dad house. No, this is my house. My house is not a cartoon house. There's no sound.
[732.07s -> 753.93s]  Oh, shit. Sorry about that. It was on full blast. OK, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That was
[753.93s -> 759.69s]  fucking loud. I know this sounds allowed. I didn't have the desktop audio pulled down a little.
[759.69s -> 766.15s]  What OST are we going to listen to today? How about the Aqua Teen Hunger Force OST?
[766.15s -> 782.65s]  I'm not muted. What happened here? Who chipped this tooth? All right. What if what if the house
[782.65s -> 789.70s]  is just a giant garage? What? OK, what if this is a house for a car? Like you pull the car in
[789.70s -> 795.27s]  and you pull the car and you turn right and then you drive straight and you pull in into the
[795.27s -> 799.11s]  bedroom and you sleep in the car. And if you have to go to the bathroom, you have to like drive into
[799.11s -> 816.31s]  another room and like just pee out your window. A drive in house. Yeah. OK, this house makes sense
[817.18s -> 823.96s]  in some weird dystopian future where we have to stay in our cars because there are like there
[823.96s -> 829.21s]  are like weird aliens outside that will like implant themselves in your brain if you get out
[829.21s -> 847.48s]  of your car. This is this is a post 5G world. I mean, I mean, I'm talking more about like
[847.48s -> 854.34s]  it's just like aliens and the aliens don't understand the cars for some reason, right?
[854.90s -> 859.86s]  That's like the weird plot of the movie. It's like for some strange reason, the aliens do not
[859.86s -> 870.22s]  understand cars and they they're afraid of them. They won't go near them. Kind of like how that's
[870.22s -> 874.58s]  a spoiler. I was going to make a direct reference to a movie, but it's the whole it's the whole
[874.58s -> 889.59s]  thing about to say is a spoiler. All right. Well, this is the first make sure we can make this turn.
[889.59s -> 899.62s]  Say it. No, I don't want to say I don't. I know people like movies open. Slime already did this
[899.62s -> 907.98s]  bit. Just give a spoiler warning. OK, here's I'm going to give you a spoiler warning. OK,
[908.06s -> 923.53s]  this is a spoiler warning for the movie Bird Box. OK, this is I'm about to make a major
[923.53s -> 931.48s]  talk about I'm going to talk about Bird Box. OK, just are you ready? Put it on screen.
[935.75s -> 939.19s]  All right. This is why this is like in the poster of the movie.
[939.19s -> 944.15s]  I don't know. Why do I need to? I don't need to. What the fuck do I care? This is in the poster
[944.15s -> 951.61s]  of the movie. It's Samantha. What's her name? Famous, incredibly talented, famous actress.
[952.41s -> 962.17s]  Sandra Bullock, right? Nobody cares about Bird Box. Some one of you does. Who cares? Who cares?
[962.17s -> 968.01s]  No, you don't understand. People care about this shit. Do you know how much direct email
[968.01s -> 974.79s]  I've gotten about spoiling like the Lord of the Rings? I've got like seven pieces of fan mail
[974.79s -> 978.39s]  that were not fan mail at all. By the way, they lied in the subject and was like,
[978.39s -> 983.11s]  dude, such a huge fan. Click me. I love you. I'm like, oh, cool. And I click it.
[983.11s -> 988.94s]  It's like you fucking asshole. Fuck you, dude. I was on the last book and I had no idea
[989.43s -> 1013.62s]  that Sauron was the eye. Piece of shit. I'm just like, dude, I'm fucking. OK, wait. It's like in the
[1013.62s -> 1022.12s]  menu. Like the devs. OK, I got to tell you about this. I'm so fucking annoyed with this movie.
[1022.12s -> 1025.72s]  We got to continue game. We got to move the obvious. Bird Box spoilers. Click here if you
[1025.72s -> 1034.04s]  want to see them, because I got to tell you. It's my review. All right. Anyways, no, but that's
[1034.04s -> 1043.00s]  good. Here we go. OK, so in the movie Bird Box, here comes the whole movie. In the movie,
[1043.00s -> 1047.88s]  I'm going to tell you the whole movie. In the movie Bird Box, this these this aliens invade Earth
[1047.88s -> 1053.21s]  or something, and you can't look at them. They haven't. They didn't figure out that,
[1053.21s -> 1061.26s]  like, you have eyelids. You cannot look at them. If you look at them, you're in big fucking trouble.
[1061.26s -> 1066.12s]  You're you're in a lot of trouble if you look at them. But for some reason, they didn't figure
[1066.12s -> 1071.29s]  out that if everyone walks around with their eyes closed, they can just walk around like stab people
[1071.29s -> 1081.75s]  that don't ever see it coming away. Know the whole point of the movie was the birds in the box.
[1081.83s -> 1085.67s]  The birds like chirped when they were around. Oh, yeah, the writers figured that part out.
[1085.67s -> 1089.75s]  That's right. Yeah, the writers like figured out a way to make it so like they couldn't just walk up
[1089.75s -> 1097.80s]  and stab people. Right. OK, that's that's the whole point of the movie. That's the whole it's in the
[1097.80s -> 1110.49s]  title. That's not what the movie was about. What are you talking about? But that doesn't that
[1110.49s -> 1120.41s]  doesn't happen in Bird Box. That's not Bird Box. That's a different movie. What do you mean? What
[1120.41s -> 1129.59s]  movie am I thinking of? Wait, so there's not a bird in Bird Box that tweets that chirps when
[1129.83s -> 1141.32s]  the monsters are around. Yes, it is. This is a different movie. Spoils a different movie.
[1142.92s -> 1156.79s]  Movie. No, I'm being gaslit. All right. This is gaslighting. OK, where was I going with this?
[1156.79s -> 1163.02s]  What are you guys doing to me? Why do you guys say that thing about Bird Box? What did you do that
[1163.02s -> 1170.71s]  for? He's pretending for views. No, that's what happened. Long story short, in the movie Bird Box,
[1170.71s -> 1174.39s]  you have to keep your eyes closed and the aliens have not figured out a fucking way
[1174.39s -> 1179.43s]  of how to like get somebody to open their eyes so they don't know. They just stand around until
[1179.43s -> 1188.17s]  you open your eyes. So imagine like that your eyes are the car that happens in the movie Signs. No,
[1188.17s -> 1203.40s]  it doesn't. You're doing with the house. No, this is yeah. It's about being gaslit. I'm saying that
[1203.40s -> 1208.20s]  like the aliens cannot figure out how to get you out of your car, just like how they couldn't
[1208.20s -> 1217.29s]  figure out how to get you to open your eyes in Bird Box. That's what I was saying. So you drive
[1217.29s -> 1220.81s]  around in your fucking car and you have to live in your car house because the aliens don't know
[1220.81s -> 1227.42s]  how to get you to understand your car. It's not a spoiler. It's a basic presence of the presence of
[1227.42s -> 1250.01s]  the movie. OK. OK, so in this world, you cars like is it does everybody in the family have their own
[1250.01s -> 1255.32s]  car that they drive around the house and if you want to go like get breakfast like, oh, here comes
[1255.32s -> 1260.71s]  like here comes like little little Timmy coming down the stairs in his car. His house is not big
[1260.71s -> 1275.21s]  enough for that. This is supposed to be your house. It is. I don't like it. It's an aqua teen
[1275.21s -> 1290.63s]  thing that fucks me all up. I don't want an aqua teen house. Now, how am I going to do this?
[1294.95s -> 1302.39s]  I'm not going to sell it. I'm not going to lose my money on it. That's not a spoiler. That's the
[1302.39s -> 1308.70s]  basic premise of the movie. That's what I was saying. But you don't understand the fucking hate
[1308.70s -> 1327.96s]  mail that I've gotten. I want to pick this up. Just sell the damn thing. What do I care? This
[1327.96s -> 1336.01s]  was like fun for a little while, but like who cares about me making the stream room? This is
[1336.01s -> 1344.44s]  the garage. The garage leads down to a basement. Basement leads into a larger room and then a
[1344.44s -> 1350.78s]  bathroom. OK, there's a bathroom down here. This should just be the house. I just have a dummy
[1350.78s -> 1354.94s]  house upstairs like the burglars to go into if there's ever like a burglary or something,
[1354.94s -> 1366.09s]  just a fake house with a bunch of fake money. And then my house is down here. It's all just
[1366.09s -> 1372.74s]  like weird cardboard furniture and shit. But like my actual house is down there. I'm not going to
[1372.74s -> 1384.25s]  sell these computers yet. This is a fortnight house. No, it's not. This is not a fortnight house
[1384.25s -> 1401.30s]  because if I was building it like a fortnight house, I'd be doing this. OK, so I want to let's
[1401.30s -> 1408.38s]  make a fake living room. TV is going to go here. It's the only logical place for it. This house is
[1408.38s -> 1414.04s]  pretty small. You go into the front door. You need a little kitchen. This is going to be a kitchen.
[1414.04s -> 1419.83s]  What's this? This is like another weird room. This room is just why they all have a why does
[1419.83s -> 1432.12s]  every room in this house have a back entrance to the backyard? That's kind of weird, right?
[1432.12s -> 1446.79s]  I don't like that. I can't put that down here. Why can I not put that down to destroy this? I
[1446.79s -> 1457.42s]  can't destroy this either. So I'm just going to put a wall here and then I'll paint like I'll paint
[1457.42s -> 1468.39s]  just outside to be painted. It's fine. There was a spoiler for House Flipper doesn't even have a plot
[1469.11s -> 1478.17s]  more of a mystic quest. Thanks again. Five more six more subs actually. No joke. Make your dream
[1478.17s -> 1488.50s]  house. I don't think I could even do that, though. I thought about it even more last night. My dream
[1488.50s -> 1503.58s]  house is just a room, a decent toilet and a nice bed and a door that works in locks. I'm pretty
[1503.58s -> 1513.51s]  simple. It's like, well, I can't wait to do like a huge decoration upstairs. I don't upstairs may
[1513.51s -> 1518.87s]  as well. Downstairs may as well not even exist. Do I have a room with a toilet next to me? A bed
[1518.87s -> 1529.75s]  is like a 70 inch TV with like all the consoles plugged in. And yeah, I'm good. That's much better.
[1529.75s -> 1541.14s]  This is like an actual room. Need curtains here. What? Wait, I need what color? That's prison.
[1541.14s -> 1551.08s]  Um, that's not what. OK, what prison do you know that each prison cell has a 70 inch TV
[1551.08s -> 1570.26s]  in every console plugged in? You're going to go to gamer jail. You dream, dream, solitary confinement.
[1570.26s -> 1585.19s]  No. All right. I need to focus on my dream house. This is going to be up here. There's a room here.
[1585.19s -> 1592.55s]  I need to get a big picture here of this. You know, this can stay. This could just stay open.
[1598.09s -> 1604.76s]  Like, should there be signs up here that's like, yep, like you fucked up. Nothing in here, idiot.
[1604.76s -> 1614.71s]  And I like paint on the walls that says like nothing to steal. Stupid. Oh, right. You couldn't
[1614.71s -> 1630.47s]  find the right house to steal from, huh? And then have like this door just be blocked. Custom paint
[1630.47s -> 1637.03s]  images. Yeah, yeah, I like that. I like that. Have the dummy house on top of the real house.
[1637.03s -> 1642.26s]  And I'm going to put like a bunch of diamonds and shit in here. And this room is going to be the
[1643.06s -> 1649.69s]  pre room to my actual house. And I'm going to put like a sign up here that just is like toxic,
[1649.69s -> 1660.38s]  fucking toxic waste or like electrified room. Do not touch handle. And to really push this,
[1660.38s -> 1664.06s]  to make sure nobody like actual. Oh yeah, bullshit. I'm knocking over a fucking toxic
[1664.06s -> 1671.26s]  waste barrel right here. So they're like, wait, what's that? Holy shit, dude. This is a bad idea.
[1671.26s -> 1686.10s]  Go back upstairs. Do not open door. We'll break a gas line. OK, yeah. Go, go, go. We're going to
[1686.10s -> 1694.34s]  have like a bunch of like dumb. OK, I'm ready. This is this goes downstairs. OK, should I do
[1694.34s -> 1707.66s]  the fake house first or should I do the real house first? Absolute paranoid house. Fake house first.
[1707.66s -> 1713.67s]  Traps all over it. OK, yeah. So this house is going to this room is going to be like a standard
[1713.67s -> 1722.25s]  bedroom. We're going to get what's what's like the cheapest paint. OK, well, forest mist is the
[1722.25s -> 1744.18s]  cheapest paint. But why did you say, of course I do. I thought I thought I told you guys that links
[1744.18s -> 1754.81s]  we were links were banned. Thanks for the fully rigged Vista slime. Oh, no, I saw this. I saw this.
[1756.46s -> 1763.88s]  You don't know anybody in your whole life. I feel like I feel like I would want more than one.
[1763.88s -> 1784.98s]  That's fucking awesome, though. I think there should be like a whole streamer slime family
[1784.98s -> 1794.38s]  and they like switch off who's going to stream today because what I think when I think of like
[1794.38s -> 1801.88s]  the mainstreamer, which is like slime, like just slime dad, I mean, I'm thinking of like
[1801.88s -> 1808.74s]  Slimer just like a disgusting Slimer that looks like he's barely functioning, like he's barely
[1808.74s -> 1835.14s]  able to even stay upright. Here we go. Oh, there we go. Look at this room. Wait, fan links.
[1836.34s -> 1844.18s]  I've thought about it. I've thought about it. Thank you, DJ on the beat. Thanks for the five
[1844.18s -> 1852.42s]  community subs. Thank you. Don't do it. I thought about it. You know, when people if you start to
[1853.14s -> 1863.08s]  overstay your link privileges. All right, what's something what's like looks OK.
[1863.08s -> 1871.29s]  I mean, we need something that has to look good enough. Right. This is cheap.
[1871.29s -> 1887.61s]  Porcelain. Oh, no. Fifty dollars to one. Fifty bucks from Ellis. Thank you, Ellis,

[1917.82s -> 1923.51s]  Completely not necessary to give me that amount of money, but I appreciate it nonetheless.
[1924.39s -> 1929.85s]  Um, stop. Stop spamming my link. All right, let's go with, um,
[1932.79s -> 1947.45s]  should I name one of the rooms like expensive shit and this? Oh, no, it's time to do it.
[1947.45s -> 1954.57s]  We got I think we got to close links today. All it takes is you know how they say all it takes is
[1954.57s -> 1960.57s]  one person. Well, no, all it takes is like 400 people. This is be spamming links. And that's
[1960.57s -> 1975.19s]  when you get my attention. OK, somebody just write, let's go spam. No, what? No, stay. Don't
[1975.19s -> 1989.35s]  go anywhere. Don't go. Stay. Stay and then hang out. This looks good. God damn it. But it's I.
[1989.35s -> 2012.58s]  Oh, I do the same. I'm so boring. No. Wait, it's the same. Is it the same? Shit. It's really close.
[2012.58s -> 2031.62s]  OK, hold on. It's got to be something else. Floor rugs. No floor panels. It's a toilet house. No,
[2031.62s -> 2039.13s]  we're going to do, um, blue fitted carpet. That's better. Better, better, better, better,
[2039.13s -> 2053.11s]  better, better. OK. And the walls are changing that. God damn it. I don't know. I can't get
[2053.11s -> 2060.66s]  the doctor's office out of my mind. I don't. Should I do this? Change the walls. Jeans. Make
[2060.66s -> 2068.92s]  a jeans house. Denim ground. It's not denim. Look, you toss a rug on here and it's going to be
[2068.92s -> 2075.46s]  just fine. Watch this. Ready? Just toss. Look at this. Check this out. You toss a rug on here.
[2080.65s -> 2104.76s]  Look at that. It's changed the room entirely. It's a completely different room now. There.
[2104.76s -> 2111.08s]  I have made I've changed the room completely. I put a fucking expensive ass chandelier sphere
[2111.08s -> 2117.80s]  atom thing. Look at that. I want to see the before and after. And then a painting right here,
[2117.80s -> 2136.82s]  too. These walls are terrible. OK, we just need just like cheap a pet desk.
[2139.85s -> 2146.47s]  Why? What do you mean a pet desk? This actually is a desk for a dog or something. This is weird.
[2146.47s -> 2166.41s]  It's tiny. No, that's too small. Furniture. I need. Yeah, like, here we go. Bambino.
[2170.17s -> 2174.57s]  Should this be like a fake? This is going to be a fake kid's room.
[2174.57s -> 2182.36s]  No, there's nothing to steal. Germa desk. Germa desk. Germa desk. Yeah.
[2186.55s -> 2203.77s]  What is this? It's a crib. No, I want a bed. Here we are. One of these or.
[2205.67s -> 2214.97s]  Wait, is this a bed up top? It is. Holy shit. This is awesome. OK, this is my favorite kind
[2214.97s -> 2225.35s]  of bunk bed because it's a bunk bed without the other asshole underneath you. Perfect.
[2225.43s -> 2230.01s]  You know, I almost wish this was reversed. I don't want my bed this close to the ceiling,
[2230.01s -> 2237.53s]  but I would like sit up there. I don't care about that. I want to like climb up to my desk
[2237.53s -> 2245.85s]  and sleep down here. That would be cool if you climb up and there's like a platform and you
[2245.85s -> 2252.95s]  sit up here. I think that would be pretty. I want to be I don't I want to be closer to the ground.
[2252.95s -> 2259.78s]  I don't want to be sleeping up here. It freaks me out. No, not gray. All right. Blue.
[2260.50s -> 2265.13s]  We're going to go with the blue. The blue looks good, especially in a house that's gray with.
[2265.13s -> 2274.76s]  There we go. Perfect. OK, this just encompasses everything I told you guys I wanted in a house.
[2275.32s -> 2282.30s]  This is really all I need. You ready? You have a place to sleep up top right there.
[2283.03s -> 2287.61s]  You have a place to do your work right there. You just need a chair. You've got exercise.
[2287.61s -> 2297.54s]  You can climb up and down that thing like 10 times. You have the storage shoes, clothes.
[2297.54s -> 2300.90s]  You have a toilet. You could you could you could just piss in that.
[2300.98s -> 2304.86s]  Just have a hole in the ground. All right. There's your shoes and your clothes.
[2304.86s -> 2307.42s]  And you can slide that and there's like a little there's a hole in the ground.
[2307.42s -> 2314.17s]  You can just pee into it. It's a toilet. And just give me a TV right there.
[2314.17s -> 2325.96s]  Right in that big rectangle in the middle. It's perfect. TV right here.
[2325.96s -> 2331.37s]  And you just like go in here and sit and watch. What would a kitchen be?
[2334.66s -> 2340.39s]  You just order McDonald's every day. You know who cooks. What do you mean?
[2340.39s -> 2353.61s]  It's bad placement. Yeah, it kind of is. That's a little better.
[2357.11s -> 2364.71s]  No, it's not. It needs to be like a little bit. What about the closet?
[2365.51s -> 2374.17s]  Oh, fuck. Yeah, it needs to. OK, where do I put my hamster hotel?
[2374.17s -> 2377.45s]  The thing that I want so badly, I can't put it anywhere. It doesn't fit here.
[2382.73s -> 2396.04s]  Here? I guess it fits right here. Walk in the window. But you know, whatever.
[2399.61s -> 2401.13s]  Should I go then? Maybe that goes in another room.
[2401.69s -> 2411.59s]  I know a lot of you guys are talking a lot of some talking some serious shit right now.
[2412.39s -> 2419.13s]  But if you woke up and you kind of like went to the bathroom and you opened up a door and there was
[2419.13s -> 2424.65s]  like a McDonald's play place in one of the behind one of the doors in your house,
[2425.37s -> 2428.12s]  you don't think that you would go in there and just fuck around all the time?
[2433.54s -> 2437.93s]  Of course you would. Hamster. Yeah, the hamster house.
[2437.93s -> 2441.69s]  Imagine if you could go into a person sized hamster wheel and just sprint around your house
[2441.69s -> 2449.46s]  and smash the fuck into walls and you'd be fine. You just sprint in this bubble
[2449.46s -> 2462.84s]  and could just go anywhere. Just run into stuff that's lying. Oh, I know. OK, that's fine.
[2462.84s -> 2469.62s]  Now let's go with I want to put I want to put blinds on there, but not blinds. I hate blinds.
[2470.18s -> 2477.21s]  I want like just regular curtains, a multiple narrow curtain there and we can make this room
[2478.01s -> 2487.88s]  pop. I had a little bit of orange. It needs to be bigger than that.
[2487.88s -> 2506.92s]  It needs to be wide curtain, multiple short wide curtain. What's wrong with that? The bed in the
[2506.92s -> 2539.00s]  way. Where are the curtains? Oh, perfect. I just I only have this in here because I want it,
[2539.00s -> 2555.72s]  not because it makes sense in the room. Not big enough. All right, I can fix that.
[2556.46s -> 2572.50s]  This is fixable. Honey, we've got to take the wall down so I can fit my hamster bed.
[2572.50s -> 2581.69s]  Um, I can't can we just get a regular mattress that we know. Excuse me. You did not say
[2581.69s -> 2617.82s]  McDonald's play place. OK, move the door. That's too late. This room just got much bigger.
[2617.82s -> 2627.48s]  Oops. I swung and hit the wrong part of the house. You never do your own project.
[2631.18s -> 2638.28s]  This is one of those scenarios where it's just like, OK, let's start our project.
[2638.28s -> 2646.94s]  Here we go. We've got our tools. Cut to the ambulance. Cut to in the in the emergency room
[2646.94s -> 2661.69s]  where I'm like on like five different machines. He's flatlining. OK, this has to be like this,
[2661.69s -> 2674.70s]  though. Cut to the cut to a funeral. Well, does that have the same weight? Because how did he die?
[2674.70s -> 2681.86s]  We don't know. That could be like years in the future. If you cut to the funeral of the guy,
[2681.86s -> 2687.34s]  it's like, oh, no, he died. And then it goes back to their house. And what an amazing looking
[2687.34s -> 2692.49s]  incredible project that they did. By the way, this is the funeral is like from two or three years
[2692.49s -> 2702.89s]  after they completed this awesome project that you got to have context there. I don't think you
[2702.89s -> 2716.79s]  cut to the funeral. Irma has died of construction project. All right, here we go. Perfect. Now,
[2716.79s -> 2733.37s]  this room becomes longer like this. Trust yourself, man. Don't fucking listen to what anybody says.
[2734.01s -> 2738.46s]  Do you do it like this? Yeah, you did this. Nobody don't listen to fucking anybody.
[2738.46s -> 2740.62s]  Oh, and you can't fucking do it like this. I can fucking do it.
[2741.34s -> 2747.32s]  See, don't let anybody tell you can't do that. Can't do it because it's too close to the
[2747.32s -> 2764.36s]  window. It's all right. I can make this a corner. This is going to be a corner that people do that,
[2764.36s -> 2805.78s]  right? Disgusting. This is not disgusting. See, problem completely solved there. Oh, looks actually
[2805.78s -> 2817.56s]  really good. Cracks, cracks, lol. You guys have any idea what's surrounding you in your house
[2817.56s -> 2821.80s]  right now? You know how many cracks, how many broken like pieces of wood are just surrounding
[2821.80s -> 2828.14s]  you? You know how many dead animals are surrounding you right now? Right now, there are probably like
[2828.78s -> 2835.70s]  10 different dead bugs and animals surrounding you in your walls. There's a squirrel that's
[2835.70s -> 2839.80s]  dead in your wall. That's a skeleton that's been there for probably 45 years and it's
[2841.19s -> 2848.17s]  less than five feet, probably away from your face. So crack in the wall that I'm covering up.
[2848.17s -> 2874.25s]  Oh, it's not a big problem to me. How do you know that? Look it up. You put them in there.
[2874.73s -> 2883.70s]  How do you put something in a wall? So you're telling me that you think that you knock apart,
[2883.70s -> 2893.70s]  you go cut into your drywall and place an object in there and then put the drywall back up. Well,
[2893.70s -> 2903.53s]  for what reason? I just open up the drywall and dump like 5,000 crickets in there and then seal it.
[2903.53s -> 2909.14s]  Yeah, that's right. That's what I did today. Why did you do that? I don't know.
[2912.42s -> 2920.41s]  Shit! Is it big enough? All right, you can reach it. It's not big enough. It's not big enough.
[2920.41s -> 2927.24s]  Wait, can I turn the other way? You're fine. You're fine. You can fit in here. Just only open this
[2927.24s -> 2933.24s]  one and then duck and then kind of get your body inside of it and then and then get your clothes.
[2933.24s -> 2942.74s]  You have to close this one first and then leave. It's fine. The person using this is going to be
[2942.74s -> 2953.16s]  like this tall anyways. Yeah, you. Yeah. Wait, get that out of here. Can I take this down and
[2953.16s -> 2961.03s]  just go one more? I can do it now. I'm going to fix this. This is my dream house. What are
[2961.03s -> 2978.15s]  you talking about? This is my dream fake house above my real dream house. OK, so right here is
[2978.15s -> 2998.63s]  where I can safely open this. We're good. Close it up. Perfect. There we go. I don't fucking listen
[2998.63s -> 3006.38s]  to anybody. You can't do that. You can't. What are you doing? You're an idiot. Shut up. I can
[3006.38s -> 3010.54s]  fucking do it. I can do whatever I want. I'm not going to tell you anything like that ever again.
[3011.50s -> 3026.31s]  I'm not listening to anybody. Hey, it worked. What was he talking to? Oh, OK, I need paint.
[3026.31s -> 3031.27s]  We're doing a better paint, too. I want something nicer than this. Not I don't want it too dark,
[3031.27s -> 3056.36s]  though. No grays. Get away from the gray ink mist. Just just black every room. It's blue like
[3056.36s -> 3071.34s]  an Azure Bliss or a sleep. I think sleepy blue, baby blue. Let's try sleepy blue. I want to get
[3071.34s -> 3091.78s]  this right. Wait a minute here. Hold on. Hold on a minute here. A minute here. Hold on a minute
[3091.78s -> 3102.36s]  here. One, two, three, four, five. One, two, three. Hold on. Wait a minute here. One, two,
[3102.36s -> 3126.68s]  three, four, one, two, three, four, five. What's it? What color is this? Forest mist, right? OK,
[3127.24s -> 3144.73s]  one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four. Nice. Then that means
[3145.37s -> 3151.61s]  one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen,
[3152.17s -> 3160.41s]  fifteen. So we need one here or up there. I paint it. What's wrong with this?
[3165.38s -> 3185.32s]  And I want like a green too or something. What looks better? Green. I need to see what this
[3185.32s -> 3190.92s]  looks like. Jerma, Jerma, hurry up. No, I'm making my dream fucking fake house. OK,
[3190.92s -> 3211.48s]  it's terrible. This is why I can't design anything. I like don't get it. My design philosophy is put
[3212.04s -> 3216.42s]  different color line in here. I don't know. That's why everything's gray. That's why all
[3216.42s -> 3226.89s]  my floors are gray. All my everything in my whole house is gray. I don't understand. I don't get it.
[3226.89s -> 3234.98s]  Should I do like a line, line, line or like one wall should be? Hold on. What if I do one whole
[3234.98s -> 3268.87s]  wall? OK, that looks all right. Do all blue. That's not too much, though. Oh, then I know
[3269.59s -> 3286.86s]  we can put little cloud artwork all over here. Yeah. Yeah. Like every baby boy's room in America.
[3289.22s -> 3306.63s]  Cloud, cloud, cloud, rainbow, frog, cloud, cloud, cloud, rainbow, frog.
[3306.71s -> 3331.61s]  Gaming. I get rid of this. It's going to it's going to pee through the walls here. All right.
[3331.61s -> 3339.58s]  Thank you. This is not disgusting. Disgust. This is OK. If you think this is disgusting,
[3339.58s -> 3345.18s]  then then you thought your room was disgusting. This is what it looked like. This is what your
[3345.18s -> 3355.13s]  room looked like when you were like 12. OK, this is what your room looked like. No, it didn't. Yes,
[3355.13s -> 3361.62s]  it did. When you were like under the age of seven, you had this room, this room right here.
[3361.70s -> 3375.35s]  What about dinosaurs? Yeah, we're going to put like dinosaur action figures on here. No, they better
[3375.35s -> 3382.12s]  not be expensive. Whatever they are, they better be cheap. Oh, wait, you know, you guys talk about
[3382.12s -> 3388.63s]  the stealing furniture. You can't deal this. It's just not it's bolted to the ground. It doesn't
[3388.63s -> 3420.31s]  come up, hinge on the floor. Hmm. That'd be cheap. Yeah, it better be cheap. Put concrete in here.
[3425.10s -> 3429.34s]  Bolted furniture is in prisons. No, it's not. It's in people who want to make sure that their
[3429.34s -> 3443.90s]  stuff is secure. It doesn't move. I open and close these. Oh, you can't close and open these.
[3448.62s -> 3459.11s]  All right. Now we need. OK, installations vent grill. Yeah. No, no, no. Wait a minute. Wait a
[3459.11s -> 3462.39s]  minute. We're not we don't give a shit about like giving and putting AC or heat up here.
[3463.11s -> 3476.54s]  This is not even real. No air in here. Nobody's going to be sleeping in here. This is a fake
[3476.54s -> 3481.90s]  dream house. All right. Here we go. This is perfect. Who the fuck is going to steal this?
[3482.38s -> 3484.86s]  It's twenty twenty, dude. You're going to you're not going to pick this up.
[3485.66s -> 3502.95s]  You can't sell this electronic equipment. No, no cool speakers. We're going to this is going to be
[3502.95s -> 3507.35s]  this. We're going to have so much such a wow mini fridge downstairs, a router,
[3507.35s -> 3513.48s]  a bunch of consoles and stuff. Oh, this is the real house is going to be awesome.
[3514.20s -> 3524.31s]  And none of this belongs in this room. TV remote microwave.
[3525.35s -> 3527.59s]  Should there be a microwave in this kid's room?
[3535.82s -> 3545.21s]  No, it's not even a person's room, though. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. A DVD player.
[3545.21s -> 3552.71s]  This is a perfect, perfect fake Ikea room where you lean over here and you go, oh,
[3552.71s -> 3557.99s]  and you touch this and it's hollow and it's like, boom, boom, boom. Oh, shit. Oh, this is not real.
[3557.99s -> 3569.11s]  OK, if you you come in here. All right, here we go. I got I got I got I got two minutes.
[3570.12s -> 3573.80s]  I got to figure out what I want to steal this house. I'm in. I'm in. I'm in. What's in this room?
[3574.44s -> 3580.52s]  OK, we got fucking nothing. DVD player. I got to get the fuck. I have to get out of the house now.
[3580.52s -> 3586.74s]  DVD player. No, I'm like this house sucks. Wrong one. Who uses a DVD player in 2020?
[3586.74s -> 3598.55s]  This house sucks. OK, what are the like just like fake like plastic Ikea furniture thing can we do
[3598.55s -> 3607.80s]  here? Decorations. Now, here's the thing. Should I make it like a game for them? Should there be
[3607.80s -> 3613.27s]  like a two like two hundred thousand dollar painting like hidden in all of the bullshit?
[3613.27s -> 3630.46s]  All right, hold on pictures and paintings. Put it somewhere like random. Like there's no reason why
[3630.46s -> 3635.62s]  you would care to look over here. OK, yeah, here's what I'm going to have with it. This is the plan.
[3635.62s -> 3640.50s]  I'm going to put like a two hundred thousand dollar painting behind the wicked shitty stove,
[3641.06s -> 3645.46s]  like down here. So all you need to do is just move the plastic Ikea furniture and it's like,
[3645.46s -> 3653.70s]  holy shit, there's a Mona Lisa back here. And you got to give them at least something. I mean,
[3653.70s -> 3663.64s]  I'll have like five of those downstairs. Bathroom. There's no reason for a bathroom up here.
[3664.44s -> 3669.75s]  Well, what would what would there be a bathroom up here for? It's not a real house.
[3673.38s -> 3677.14s]  OK, imagine coming into somebody's house and you only have like a few minutes.
[3680.41s -> 3684.09s]  You're running around like, OK, what am I going to steal? OK, that's just this.
[3684.81s -> 3693.53s]  Where's the bathroom? You would question everything. This is that. Yeah, somebody just
[3693.53s -> 3700.10s]  said this is a game show house. This is a house that's made. This is set and exactly. Yeah. But
[3700.10s -> 3707.29s]  why would there be a functioning toilet up here? There's no reason to have a functioning toilet.
[3707.29s -> 3714.98s]  This is going to be another bedroom or like a closet or something. We're not done here yet,
[3714.98s -> 3738.38s]  though. Use the toilet backstage. Shit, I spit everywhere. Put kitty litter in the corner.
[3739.58s -> 3743.26s]  Yeah, that's not a bad idea. If I can do it, I'll put like 10 litter boxes over here.
[3743.82s -> 3749.69s]  So you come and you go, oh, there's a lot of cats in here. A lot of cats in this house.
[3750.58s -> 3753.54s]  But where are they, though? Where are the cats? How come they're nowhere?
[3753.54s -> 3757.29s]  Where then? Why are there no cats? Paint the top of the windows.
[3757.93s -> 3768.06s]  I knew somebody was going to be like, this is all right. Let's go. You get the vision.
[3768.78s -> 3786.73s]  Get the vision. Good. What was it called? Sleepy Blue. You're making a crack then.
[3788.84s -> 3796.04s]  No, this is a fake house upstairs and then the real house is downstairs, which I guess could be
[3796.04s -> 3803.99s]  a front for a drug operation. Now that I think about it. Yes, you, I guess like,
[3806.25s -> 3819.51s]  what's going on here? Nothing. Yeah, nothing. Actually, you're right. What's going on downstairs?
[3823.37s -> 3827.45s]  That's what the fake room for it before the real room is for. This is going to be a bunch of boxes
[3827.45s -> 3839.78s]  and storage as I'm five steps ahead of you. That looks good. Always the same voice.
[3840.74s -> 3844.98s]  Don't you get it? Whenever I'm talking about somebody that's not me, they either sound like
[3844.98s -> 3849.78s]  this. They sound like this. Or they sound like this. There's only three other people that I've
[3849.78s -> 3866.97s]  referenced. It's always the same three people. That's the easiest way for me to differentiate
[3866.97s -> 3873.14s]  that it's not me talking. Because if I go, think about that, right? If I don't make some type of
[3873.14s -> 3877.30s]  differential voice to who I'm talking, I'm a different person speaking, then me saying this.
[3879.37s -> 3884.01s]  Yeah. Yeah. The paint looks good. Look at that paint. Yeah. Okay. Good job with that paint.
[3884.33s -> 3889.53s]  Hey, welcome to the drug den. I do drugs downstairs. Hey, officer. Yeah, come on in.
[3889.53s -> 3892.82s]  Yeah, go. Don't look downstairs though. There's drugs everywhere down there.
[3892.82s -> 3898.78s]  Oh, that's the storage. Just storage down there. You understand how that doesn't work now?
[3898.78s -> 3907.88s]  That's just me saying that. It has to be somebody else. It can't be me. All right,
[3907.88s -> 3919.61s]  that room is pretty good. Maybe another decoration. It's just me saying it. Is that part of the stream
[3919.61s -> 3937.64s]  or is that a cry for help? See, you get it now. No, it's not that. It's the voice. It's the other
[3937.64s -> 3945.02s]  voice doing it. I can push all of my insecurities through the other voice. I'm just sitting here
[3945.02s -> 3953.82s]  watching the stream with you guys. Gas mask. All right, let's go with furniture.
[3958.58s -> 3970.92s]  I need a chair in here. Yeah, this is like wooden. This is a fucking wood chair. It's a little small,
[3970.92s -> 3989.35s]  but it's fine. I need to have something else. Yeah, get a chair from like the 1400s.
[3993.45s -> 4001.72s]  Just wood. Just hard, painful wood. Why do they still make chairs out of wood? Am I crazy for
[4001.72s -> 4008.42s]  saying this? Everybody puts a pad on their chairs if they made it a wood. Why even make them out of
[4008.42s -> 4014.90s]  wood? Why not make them out of like silicone and like have the legs be wood? Why do we have to sit
[4014.90s -> 4030.18s]  on wood still? I don't understand. It's easy to make. It's cheap. Wood looks good. I guess.
[4031.06s -> 4040.52s]  This sucks to sit on. Okay, how about for support, you adult. I'm saying the wood,
[4040.52s -> 4046.94s]  you can keep this. Yeah, but sitting on wood sucks. You don't want to sit in this for more than like
[4046.94s -> 4059.58s]  10 minutes. Is there going to be a washing machine up here? And get cushions. Yeah, then why not just
[4059.58s -> 4068.06s]  have like a cushioned thing that you actually sit on? Oh, here we go. This is perfect. Just a fucking
[4068.14s -> 4085.98s]  plastic recycling bin. There's a million chairs like that. Yeah, I know there's options,
[4089.13s -> 4100.79s]  but at the end of the day, like sitting on wood hurts as a poop bucket. Where's the plaster?
[4100.79s -> 4123.06s]  You need a thicker butt. Fix the door. That can wait. I don't even know what you're talking about.
[4123.70s -> 4139.10s]  That's it for plaster, right? Yep. Now outlets. What's the point? I almost want to take this door
[4139.10s -> 4149.40s]  out because the door means you can go in there. No, that's more suspicious that way. Okay, so I'm
[4149.40s -> 4154.73s]  going to put what does this is the garage leading to the door that leads to the real house. Let's
[4154.73s -> 4162.78s]  figure out what we're going to do here. This is bedroom one. Let's go decorations or what about
[4162.78s -> 4176.76s]  equipment? No toilet paper. No, no reason. Accessories. This is stealable. I don't want
[4176.76s -> 4188.22s]  it in here. Just spoons. No one's going to steal utensils. Put a tent in here. No,
[4189.18s -> 4206.89s]  put a tent in the house. Hold on. Jar full of manna. Okay, this is fake fruit. Perfect. That's
[4206.89s -> 4219.40s]  perfect for our kitchen. Where's that going to be? Right here, right? Yeah. What happened to the
[4219.40s -> 4225.72s]  mirror maze? I had like a mental breakdown playing the mirror house yesterday and had a lot to do
[4225.72s -> 4230.76s]  with it. The Luigi's Mansion music just got wicked fucked up. It was messing with me. I had to stop.
[4230.76s -> 4243.83s]  I had to get out. Anything else I want in here? It's in this room particularly. These are going
[4243.83s -> 4272.01s]  to be in every room. Decorations maybe. Plants. No. Nah. Nah. Ikea? Firewood in here? No, no, no,
[4272.01s -> 4280.63s]  no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's just firewood down here.
[4280.63s -> 4308.18s]  There's nothing down here. This is like firewood. There's nothing in here. I have to do a different
[4308.18s -> 4319.50s]  variety though. I don't want it to look like Minecraft. Put a gas stove on the front lawn
[4319.50s -> 4329.82s]  to scare off the thieves. No, a gas stove on the front lawn means I'll probably be on an episode
[4329.82s -> 4347.66s]  of Hoarders in a few weeks. That's what that means. All right, let's do the other variant.
[4348.22s -> 4360.65s]  There's got to be enough space that I can walk through here though. Okay, this plenty,
[4360.65s -> 4374.41s]  this plenty space. Well then upstairs has to be a like a shitty wood stove. There's a lot of firewood
[4374.97s -> 4391.03s]  put on new music. Okay, somebody recommend something that's not Luigi's Mansion? Not really.
[4393.45s -> 4399.99s]  Is this not a lot of wood? I guess maybe not. Okay, those of you that have used, I've never
[4399.99s -> 4406.28s]  used a wood burning stove or anything. How much, how long would you be able to heat your house
[4406.84s -> 4419.38s]  with this much wood? Not very long. Maybe a couple of hours. A few hours. Hour, a couple
[4419.38s -> 4451.50s]  hours. Damn, really? Holy shit. That doesn't seem like very long at all. Two days. Wait,
[4451.50s -> 4458.89s]  is that you kidding? Or is it what I, who said what? It's not supposed to be symmetrical.
[4459.69s -> 4465.26s]  If it was, it would look weird if it was symmetrical. This is stacked wood.
[4465.90s -> 4485.80s]  It would be two to three days. Okay, so I was just, am I taking a picture? Okay, no, I don't want the
[4485.80s -> 4495.99s]  camera. I want variant one. Close to your Instagram. All right, one more layer. Just like a little bit
[4495.99s -> 4511.78s]  kind of tethered down a little. Layered a little, you know what I'm saying? This is probably the
[4511.78s -> 4526.39s]  most thought I've put into the whole house. Okay, good. That looks good. That's like if you got
[4526.39s -> 4531.27s]  firewood down here. Did I put the wood stove down here? Would that make sense? Or does it have to be
[4531.27s -> 4544.06s]  on the same layer? All right, don't open that door. I slammed a water before I started playing.
[4544.78s -> 4703.91s]  So that water is on its way out. So I got to be right back. Come on, guys, if we can convince
[4703.91s -> 4709.37s]  him to play 100 gecks, just keep spamming 100 gecks or riot. Well, now I know what I'm not
[4709.37s -> 4736.30s]  going to play ever. Welcome back to the stream, everybody. It's me, Jabba that I vied. Slime, slime,
[4736.30s -> 4742.23s]  everyone riot, everyone riot. If you could do me a favor and stop rioting, that would be awesome.
[4742.23s -> 4750.36s]  I would be so good on radio. You all know it. Streaming, like streaming, if it doesn't work out,
[4750.36s -> 4754.79s]  I'm just going to go to the radio station. I'm just going to be like, can I have an interview?
[4757.70s -> 4765.93s]  Are you sure? Do you apply through our website portal? No. Okay, I guess we have a position open.
[4765.93s -> 4772.06s]  Come sit down. Okay, I will. So can you tell me about yourself a little? Of course I can.
[4772.06s -> 4780.36s]  I grew up in Massachusetts in a small town called Boston. Okay. What are you interested in? Well,
[4780.36s -> 4786.42s]  I'll tell you. I love talking. I love talking to people. I'm a people person. You need somebody
[4786.42s -> 4793.06s]  to read the news. I'm that guy. I also like video games. I grew up on them my entire life.
[4797.26s -> 4803.72s]  Okay. Can you would just just us in the room here together? I can't turn it off. Let me do my thing.
[4804.28s -> 4820.71s]  Okay. Change the channel. Make, please, please make a booker house. I'm going to have to
[4820.71s -> 4830.90s]  respectfully decline. And by the way, if you're going to take 95, I would avoid it. Just keep that.
[4833.46s -> 4839.06s]  You know how awesome that would be? Just reading like where like the traffic is. I would be so
[4839.06s -> 4845.14s]  good at that. You're going to have to find a way around through the rotary on Second Street. And
[4845.14s -> 4859.03s]  by the way, if you be careful, there is a crash in an accident on I-95. I would kill it. And I
[4859.03s -> 4866.30s]  would just throw shit in there that like somebody would hear. Make sure you take the rotary.
[4867.90s -> 4875.93s]  Wait, I'm fired. I got fired. The door rips open. You fucked up a word. You're fired. Hold on. Let
[4875.93s -> 4883.66s]  me do it again. Just take the rotary on Second Street. Come on, Gwen. Coming up next, we have
[4883.66s -> 4888.98s]  the news by Jake Stevenson. He's coming up here. And one of you guys would be like, what? Hold
[4888.98s -> 4897.32s]  the fuck on. What did he just? Who's that? All right. Stop walking in circles and play. I've
[4897.32s -> 4908.76s]  stopped this. Toy boat, toy boat, toy boat. Don't do it. Don't say toy boat. Toy boat, toy boat,
[4908.76s -> 4913.24s]  toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat. Oh yeah. He still can do it. I could
[4913.24s -> 4922.50s]  fucking read the weather. If you gave me a script, I'll do it. What's happening? Okay. Let's go. I
[4922.50s -> 4938.82s]  needed the second room. This room is done. Here's kitchen, all wood, a wooden sink.
[4942.25s -> 4952.44s]  This is just like construction house. I don't know what happened over there, but I'll fix it later.
[4952.44s -> 4972.02s]  Fuck this. This should be made out of silicone. Everything should be made out of silicone.
[4976.18s -> 4990.79s]  Okay. Cabinet. What do we got for cabinets? We got the wood. Yeah. Jesus. This. Okay. I know
[4990.79s -> 5011.34s]  how like wooden cabinets look good, but these don't. This is a really tall.
[5016.34s -> 5024.60s]  Where are the long cabinets? Too tall for you. That's too tall for anybody. This is like,
[5024.60s -> 5032.26s]  it's like, that's 11 feet tall. You would have trouble reaching that. Let's do a tiered system.
[5040.38s -> 5043.42s]  Oh shit. All right. Nice. And then we have like a painting up there. Nice.
[5049.43s -> 5063.86s]  Too high, too low, too high, too low. Okay. I need the kitchen. Okay. Door cabinet,
[5064.42s -> 5072.20s]  single door cabinet. Where's the wooden corner cabinet? Wooden corner left,
[5072.20s -> 5109.48s]  wooden double door. Here we go. Why does this look crooked? Is the wall crooked? Oh no. Right. Shit.
[5109.48s -> 5129.54s]  I can't do that. Try it. What's the ride for? What are you talking about? I hate the way that
[5129.54s -> 5135.29s]  looks. What if I get rid of this? What is it? What's over there? I hate how that looks. I
[5135.29s -> 5145.51s]  don't like that little thing sticking out. It's pissing me off. Turn off slow mode. Why would
[5145.51s -> 5163.00s]  I turn off slow mode? There's like some 7,000 people here. Turn off slow mode. I hate this. I
[5163.00s -> 5177.77s]  know I've done this like three times already, but I don't like how this looks. I have the solution.
[5177.77s -> 5193.29s]  Don't worry. Turn on fast mode. That's just no restrictions. I have the solution. The solution
[5193.29s -> 5218.28s]  is here. There we go. And then this wall just needs to be built this way. Why? Is that good?
[5219.64s -> 5230.76s]  Yes. This legit looks like a lot of fun. Yeah, it is. We said this yesterday. We talked about
[5230.76s -> 5239.11s]  it yesterday. This is like one of my favorite games. It just exists in its own fun world.
[5240.71s -> 5248.12s]  I wish there was a little bit more freedom. I wish there was more freedom. If I could
[5249.94s -> 5256.55s]  delete stuff on the outside, if you could make the actual house, if I want to take down this
[5256.55s -> 5260.79s]  wall and remove these windows, if I want to get rid of a staircase or put a staircase in,
[5261.51s -> 5270.18s]  you're talking about now you're at a 10. That's how you get to a 10. Just play The Sims. It's
[5270.18s -> 5274.98s]  not the same. It's not the same. This is first person like home decoration. It's not like in a
[5274.98s -> 5286.58s]  cartoon universe. This is realistic graphics, realistic game. It's not cartoon sim world.
[5286.58s -> 5293.85s]  So Minecraft. Minecraft is not... No, what are you talking about? I would be careful here.
[5293.85s -> 5298.57s]  Fried lightly here, guys. You're talking shit about potentially my favorite game ever.
[5298.57s -> 5326.58s]  I would choose your words more carefully. How's that? That's better. Super blue? No,
[5326.58s -> 5343.61s]  not super blue. That's super frog. Sleepy blue. Punching. Unfair. Mr. Albliston, I didn't see it.
[5346.81s -> 5356.26s]  There, that's so much better. Now it doesn't look disgusting from this side. No, it doesn't
[5356.26s -> 5368.46s]  look disgusting. Why do I keep doing this? It doesn't work every time. Why do I keep doing
[5368.46s -> 5379.99s]  this? Why do I do that? It doesn't work every single time. But now this is just like a wall
[5379.99s -> 5396.33s]  here. This has to move. This has got to move down. That sink's got to be in the right spot,
[5396.33s -> 5416.18s]  though. I don't like the sink over there. Move sleepy blue in. Albliston is in there.
[5416.18s -> 5432.26s]  I don't know what that is. Are you writing that? This has to move. I need this to be right there.
[5436.90s -> 5444.62s]  Fake SpongeBob fan. Sorry, I can't recall... Guys, I cannot recall every piece of media I have ever
[5444.62s -> 5459.59s]  seen. This has got to come in, but I made it like this so this could fit. All right, moving... Okay,
[5459.59s -> 5465.59s]  I'm taking the advice that that guy said like an hour and a half ago. Move wall. No, move door.
[5466.15s -> 5481.54s]  Move the window. I can't move the windows. They're locked in place. You make me able to move
[5481.54s -> 5501.77s]  windows and move staircases and take out exterior walls? Game's a 10. Okay, I need this. Okay,
[5501.77s -> 5509.93s]  front door. No, not a front door. We need a... Here, internal white, just internal white door.
[5515.40s -> 5525.82s]  Perfect. There we go. Okay, excellent. I always have been an hour and a half and he's done nothing.
[5525.82s -> 5531.42s]  Welcome to the game. That's kind of the whole game. The whole game is just kind of do nothing
[5531.42s -> 5537.54s]  for four to ten hours and then sometimes look back and go, oh yeah, that paint looks nice.
[5541.94s -> 5544.98s]  That's better. All right, now I can move this forward a little and then this wall...
[5546.28s -> 5576.33s]  Home designing is hard. Oh, music. Right, right. Listen to your viewers. Better. This comes forward
[5577.13s -> 5591.96s]  like this. All right, this wall then comes in. What happens if I break this?
[5592.68s -> 5613.37s]  It's okay. I'll pick it up later. Somebody scratches all over these.
[5617.59s -> 5626.89s]  Why does it look like you ran over my cabinets with a car? Well, they fell. One of them fell
[5626.89s -> 5640.62s]  in the truck. It must have been a truck problem. I didn't do anything. I wonder how much shit
[5640.62s -> 5647.46s]  actually happens with instruction that you just never know. You know in the beginning of
[5647.46s -> 5652.42s]  Ace Ventura when Jim Carrey is literally just drop kicking that guy's package all over the whole
[5652.42s -> 5659.19s]  fucking entire apartment complex. How many times does that happen? How many times do they just
[5659.19s -> 5664.26s]  blow a wall out with a hammer for fun and like destroy somebody's cabinets and then go, oh shit,
[5664.26s -> 5683.45s]  we gotta patch that back up. But it happens quite frequently. All right, is that better?
[5683.45s -> 5692.97s]  Did I fix it finally? Because then this goes... Did I not do anything? No, no, I got it. I got
[5693.45s -> 5720.36s]  this one. And then I can still make it in here. Good. This has to move a little bit. Remove the
[5720.36s -> 5724.68s]  walls. No, I can't. Every single house I've ever made in this game has been just an open floor
[5724.68s -> 5735.27s]  plan. Open floor plan is just translated into I don't actually know what I should do. So just
[5735.27s -> 5761.70s]  remove all of it. Splatoon 2 OST for fuck's sake. Oh my God. Oh my goodness. Splatoon 2 OST.
[5762.50s -> 5775.14s]  Oh, actually, this is kind of cool. I like when they go...
[5779.18s -> 5797.26s]  If I had practiced in the bathtub, I would get it. Is there a song in this that's like...
[5798.46s -> 5805.29s]  I think there is, right? Where it goes... What does it do? It's this one. That's the one I'm
[5805.29s -> 5820.12s]  thinking of. I was gonna say this is one of the lyrics. Am I making progress? I feel like I'm
[5820.12s -> 5824.76s]  just Indiana Jones-ing this room. I'm just like squishing it. I'm slowly moving the walls in.
[5824.76s -> 5841.75s]  Is this doing anything? Is this gonna fix my problem? Oh, yeah, this is the song. I want this
[5841.75s -> 5877.66s]  played at my fucking funeral. Excuse me. There is no... I'm about to skip this one. Is this even
[5877.66s -> 5883.42s]  a good soundtrack? It doesn't have that song. That's a different track. It better be on here.
[5883.42s -> 5906.04s]  I'm skipping it. That's fine. Looks good. This looks like I just moved in. Throw my boxes.
[5906.94s -> 5909.82s]  All right. Put this shit back. I need to paint it. What color is the kitchen gonna be?
[5920.66s -> 5930.15s]  Copper coin? Light cream? Mustard yellow? Sunny D orange? Oh, that's Sunny D orange.
[5937.61s -> 5970.41s]  Sunny D. The orange juice enema. Why'd you say that? Oh, fuck. Usually I can blame this on
[5970.41s -> 5980.58s]  somebody. In a typical fashion, I can just blame someone in the chat for that. None of you said
[5980.58s -> 5990.12s]  that, though. I did. Hmm. Never been in this position before. That has never happened. Oh,
[5990.12s -> 6011.08s]  no. Sorry about that one. I guess. Put it down. What are you doing? Put this down.
[6011.88s -> 6041.82s]  These are in such stupid places. I hate it already. What are you saying? This music is bad.
[6042.94s -> 6053.59s]  Oh, at least somebody is gonna take the rock throwing away from my house for a change.
[6054.15s -> 6073.64s]  I didn't say that. Is this a hundred gecks? Sure. Maybe. Platoon music sounds good for
[6073.64s -> 6095.08s]  about three minutes. I don't know. Does it? Does this be flush? What do you guys think? Flush? Oh,
[6095.08s -> 6105.38s]  but no. How am I gonna wash my hands and look at the kids outside? No, I hate it. Change it.
[6105.38s -> 6123.91s]  There. Now I can see my children playing. I mean, what? I mean, what? Like, you sit in here,
[6123.91s -> 6128.87s]  you're like the dad or the mom or whatever, and you're gonna wash. The kids are playing outside,
[6128.87s -> 6135.35s]  and you can just watch them from doing the dishes or something. Kitchen island. Yeah.
[6136.15s -> 6148.58s]  That looks nice. All right. I'm gonna leave everything open. So whoever is trying to rob
[6148.58s -> 6154.39s]  this place knows, sees that there's literally nothing in this whole house. Right? If you come
[6154.39s -> 6174.28s]  in here, oh, I'm gonna steal. Let's get in there. No, nothing. Brute. It's fake. Okay. Cool. Now we
[6174.28s -> 6188.42s]  need, uh, oh yeah. You need to have appliances. Distillation. All right. I'll give you something
[6188.42s -> 6195.74s]  else. I want a different soundtrack. This is cool. I like Splatoon 2, but it lost me a little bit
[6195.74s -> 6208.55s]  when I didn't get the song that I wanted. I didn't get that song. Not Yoshi's Islands,
[6208.55s -> 6221.90s]  Outer Wilds. Now that's a good one. I can get behind that one. Outer Wilds OST.
[6224.86s -> 6229.40s]  Hey, remember when I gave Outer Wilds an 8.9 and you guys wanted to dip me in acid?
[6229.40s -> 6252.17s]  I remember that. Oh yeah. This music is so good. I'm sorry, but an 8.9 is an incredible score.
[6256.76s -> 6268.95s]  8.9. That's a, that's fantastic. That's a very, very good score. Anything below a 9.5 is
[6268.95s -> 6282.94s]  unacceptable. No, I think anything below an 8.5 would be unacceptable. Should I put this, this
[6283.74s -> 6288.46s]  toilet paper? Should I really just be like a prank? There'd be a shitload of toilet paper
[6288.46s -> 6298.28s]  just in every cabinet or in one of the cabinets. Okay. In one cabinet over here, it's going to be
[6298.28s -> 6304.52s]  full of toilet paper. He hated the game. No, it was a fucking great game. You know what? Fine. I'll
[6304.52s -> 6309.91s]  give it a nine. You want, you don't want to change. It's a 9.0. I was going to give it a 9.0.
[6310.63s -> 6329.37s]  Fine. It's a 9.0. No, it's not. It's an 8.9. Music's too low. The soundtrack sounds like an 8.9.
[6330.01s -> 6337.56s]  What does that mean? All right. Here we go. I want to do, I need kitchen shit.
[6340.44s -> 6346.73s]  Here we go. This wooden cabinet with an oven. It's not a real oven. I'm sure it's the same
[6346.73s -> 6374.44s]  wood. Can I open the oven too? Like we don't have any food either, dude. I can't put this in the oven.
[6375.08s -> 6403.59s]  Because now it's really loud. There. Toilet paper in the oven. I can't. I cannot put toilet paper in
[6403.59s -> 6408.63s]  the oven, unfortunately. I don't like this color either. It's too, it's way too bright.
[6409.19s -> 6418.18s]  Give me the lighter one. Copper coin. I think that makes, yeah, that looks, that'll look nice.
[6418.74s -> 6437.51s]  That's my app. Better. Way better. So did somebody ask why does this house look so cheap?
[6438.47s -> 6453.56s]  Um, stick around for like another hour or two and you, wrong paint. Skin. Flasher walls. No, sorry.
[6453.56s -> 6488.50s]  It's copper coin. How does that look bad? Sorry. Just getting a little sip. Meat walls. Damn. It's
[6488.50s -> 6499.24s]  really been almost two hours. How does this keep happening to me? All right. That is not this room
[6499.24s -> 6511.05s]  anymore. Get out. There we are. This is alert, alert, alert, alert. This shouldn't be here.
[6511.05s -> 6522.17s]  This is messed up. Okay. What's the ground going to be? We need some kind of tile in them.
[6522.49s -> 6532.20s]  Nobody has a carpeted kitchen. Floor. It's either tile or wood or floor. Something like this.
[6532.84s -> 6540.60s]  Something easy. A little gray. No, no gray. Although I like that. I like the way this looks.
[6543.08s -> 6555.98s]  Arcade carpet everywhere. Whatever it is, it's got to be cheap. I mean, is this the dead giveaway
[6555.98s -> 6578.18s]  that this is not a real kitchen? That there's arcade carpet? Oh, that's so ugly. It's too,
[6578.18s -> 6584.74s]  it's so ugly. I can't even have it here as the funny thing. I go, haha, it's the arcade rug. No,
[6585.46s -> 6594.04s]  it's so bad. I don't do. Am I, am I like a dick? Okay. I don't want to be like a dick,
[6595.16s -> 6603.37s]  but if you go and you're going to get carpet installed somewhere, what makes you point at
[6603.37s -> 6617.02s]  this one and go, that's the one. Love it. How, how do you, what, how did this is, it's just,
[6617.02s -> 6627.83s]  it just hurts. You know, okay. If they took out, if they took out the yellow, okay, that maybe,
[6627.83s -> 6635.45s]  but it's like, it's too, it's like I'm looking at a magic eye painting. Like I'm going to go like
[6635.45s -> 6640.17s]  this. I'm going to like cross my eyes and like Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer is going to be
[6640.17s -> 6653.86s]  there. You know, a lot of people can't do those and I couldn't do it for a really long time.
[6654.66s -> 6660.82s]  If you cannot do a magic eye, I'm going to give you the secret. If when you look at a magic eye,
[6660.82s -> 6663.06s]  you sit and you go, I can't make it work. I can't make it work.
[6664.33s -> 6670.09s]  I just, just cross my eyes while I look at it. And when I cross my eyes and look at it, eventually
[6670.09s -> 6680.74s]  the picture just goes, Oh, here it is. Okay. What's it going to be over here? This is the garage.
[6680.74s -> 6690.33s]  The garage is going to be a garage. It's not a secret. That's how it works. Wait, are you
[6690.33s -> 6699.88s]  supposed to cross your eyes? That's the point. Yeah. But I thought it was usually, but I'm not
[6699.88s -> 6705.29s]  all people can just cross their eyes straight together. You know, it's actually hard for people
[6705.29s -> 6711.46s]  to cross their eyes. Like they can't do it. So yeah, it's not a secret. I thought it was a secret
[6711.46s -> 6717.35s]  for the longest time when I was younger. Okay. I thought it was a secret when I was like 10.
[6718.07s -> 6725.98s]  And this topic has never been brought up before until today. I don't think I've heard. I haven't
[6725.98s -> 6730.84s]  thought about magic guys. There's 10 and like maybe like the two or three other times I've
[6730.84s -> 6738.17s]  referenced it before maybe, but I never talked about my secret. So my secret, that was knowledge.
[6738.17s -> 6754.09s]  That was 10 year old knowledge. I have not thought about that secret in 25 years. I'm still
[6754.09s -> 6776.49s]  crouching. Begging you start making sense when you talk. Sure. Time that person out for 10 minutes.
[6777.74s -> 6789.11s]  Is that clear? Did that make sense? Steal his spoons.
[6790.95s -> 6798.74s]  Tyrant, tyrant, evil, evil. I don't actually mean any of this shit. Don't you? There might be a lot
[6798.74s -> 6804.46s]  of new viewers here. I'm 95% of the things that say are not even true. We only have a 5%
[6804.46s -> 6812.65s]  truth policy on this channel. Perfect. Oh yeah. Wait, was this an actual toxic waste barrel?
[6812.65s -> 6836.10s]  How did I just get to that? Wait, it's an app. It's supposed to be yellow, right?
[6839.10s -> 6861.88s]  And then I don't go down there. That's where the radioactive stuff is. Make them red explosive
[6861.88s -> 6873.35s]  barrels. I can't. I want to make them yellow. I can't. Can I? Wait, I can make red explosive
[6873.35s -> 6882.74s]  barrels. Yeah. All right. So don't fuck around down here. Yeah. You turn this corner and this
[6882.74s -> 6888.44s]  is anybody. It doesn't matter who you are. If you've ever played a single video game in your
[6888.44s -> 6895.80s]  entire life, if you are in someone's house and you walk down these stairs and you see that,
[6895.80s -> 6900.44s]  this is a video game set up with poison barrels and an explosive barrel. I'm not going down here.
[6902.07s -> 6907.40s]  I'm going to come back up the stairs and I'm going to say, you go first. Not going to be me
[6907.40s -> 6918.63s]  first. Like, okay. There is like four guys over here and they're about to run at me with machine
[6918.63s -> 6930.02s]  guns and I'm supposed to shoot that barrel. Nope. I ain't going down. This is your house, man.
[6930.02s -> 6945.91s]  Perfect deterrent. All right. Good. Just build an FPS house. No, don't. This idea can't change.
[6948.60s -> 6958.54s]  I don't want to find like explosive barrels. Make it FPS house. No, it's perfect. It's so funny.
[6959.10s -> 6967.22s]  That was such a good idea. No, I can't make like a, I can't make the in the house. You're the shooter
[6967.22s -> 6973.06s]  FPS. You're in. I can't like, oh, you're going to go in here. It's like pub G explosive barrels of
[6973.06s -> 6982.97s]  weapons. God damn it. I gotta finish this. I'm finishing this one. I have to finish this. I have
[6982.97s -> 6990.81s]  to, I start, I can't just keep doing new houses. I can't. We started with mirror house, then it
[6990.81s -> 6996.97s]  turned into cars. People are in cars, living in the cars in the house. And then that turns into
[6996.97s -> 7007.29s]  a fake house. No, we're not turning this to FPS level. That's going to have to be the next one.
[7007.29s -> 7013.72s]  ADHD TV. No, I can't. We can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. Not right now. I have to finish my,
[7013.72s -> 7038.12s]  my thing. FPS level up top. I have to make my dream house. It's so perfect though. It's so
[7038.12s -> 7048.73s]  perfect. The perfect thing. All right. I'm going to finish this idea. And after the idea is over,
[7048.73s -> 7059.34s]  it can be changed. Let me do my kitchen floor. Let me do my kitchen floor. Let me, here we are.
[7062.01s -> 7068.09s]  If you just, you need to, when you do social distancing, don't stand near each other. Don't
[7068.09s -> 7084.78s]  be stupid and wear your fucking mask. There's no reason not to wear one. Hey, I think I can do a
[7084.78s -> 7094.38s]  pretty good Fauci. You do know that like when I, when I unlock a new voice, you're going to hear
[7094.38s -> 7098.94s]  it at least four or five times in a month. I'm sorry. That's the way it is here. If you don't,
[7098.94s -> 7106.65s]  if you can't handle that, I'm not sure what to tell you. I only get to unlock a new voice like
[7106.65s -> 7118.44s]  every two or three years. You got to let me have it for a little while. Oh no. I gotta hurry up.
[7121.34s -> 7161.61s]  Oh no. No, where is it? Does the screen go to black or does the screen go to white in that game?
[7161.61s -> 7179.94s]  I couldn't figure it out. Stream just reverts to the beginning. All right. No, no more distractions.
[7179.94s -> 7186.73s]  Stop. Don't distract me anymore. I'm done. Here we go. Floor tiles. I'm like the most easily
[7186.73s -> 7205.16s]  distractable person. How about this one? Floor panels. There, there we are. Okay. That looks so
[7205.88s -> 7219.58s]  cozy. You built one room in three hours. It says, excuse me. First of all, you added 33% more time.
[7219.58s -> 7226.90s]  You added a third more time. It's only been two hours. And no, I did one room and then a room
[7226.90s -> 7235.08s]  before that when we changed the new houses. Okay. Good. There's my floor. Done. Next. What's up next?
[7235.72s -> 7242.49s]  Next thing we got, there's the kitchen. We got the stove, the sink. Uh, a microwave. It's okay.
[7242.49s -> 7248.38s]  Did it just go over here? No, that's, you could unplug that and walk out with it. Things that can't
[7248.38s -> 7263.64s]  be walked. Fine. That's good. All right. This has to be a hallway. And then you turn the corner,
[7263.64s -> 7267.88s]  you peek and there it is. FPS house. I can't get over it. That's so stupid.
[7270.22s -> 7277.37s]  There we are. Here's the kitchen. You open up. There you are.
[7279.54s -> 7286.50s]  There's the bathroom, but it's not a bathroom. In fact, take this whole thing out. What's this
[7286.50s -> 7291.38s]  here for? For nothing. Did I put, what good expensive looking shit in the windows?
[7294.65s -> 7298.73s]  In the, on the windows right here in the front of the house, just put really expensive looking
[7298.81s -> 7314.84s]  clocks. What's with, why are you baiting burglars to come in? Um, because I'm so,
[7314.84s -> 7318.04s]  I guess I'm so confident that they're never going to find the real house.
[7319.08s -> 7328.33s]  I don't know. Like it's almost like I have like a camera set up up here, like in every room
[7329.70s -> 7335.42s]  and I kind of just watch and try to find the real room. But then if they find it,
[7335.42s -> 7351.37s]  I'm in a lot of trouble. It's a Frank video house.
[7351.37s -> 7364.12s]  Okay. This house is becoming a lot of different things.
[7367.86s -> 7372.42s]  Yeah. The first is going to come in here and they're going to get chased around this
[7372.42s -> 7379.74s]  house by a guy in a gorilla suit. No more monkey in around here.
[7380.30s -> 7390.01s]  We'll see when we come back next on prank masters. They're always so huddled down in
[7390.01s -> 7395.61s]  front of the little screen they have. Oh, they're coming in. Like why do you have one screen?
[7396.57s -> 7398.65s]  How come you don't have that way bigger? Why is it like,
[7398.65s -> 7401.61s]  why are you like eight people hovering over and looking at somebody else's monitor?
[7402.17s -> 7415.42s]  Why would we put it up on the fucking wall, dude? It's always this wicked cramped ass room.
[7415.98s -> 7421.64s]  Oh, they're in a room closet. Why wouldn't you have a huge setup for that?
[7422.28s -> 7430.86s]  Well, they're always in like a hotel room. I know that some of that is because they're in
[7430.86s -> 7437.26s]  the hotel room next door, but doesn't make any sense to me because if this 10 people
[7437.26s -> 7442.12s]  all like laughing their ass off and talking in the hotel room next door,
[7442.12s -> 7447.61s]  wouldn't you hear that if you were in the adjacent room?
[7447.61s -> 7451.54s]  Like, can you imagine like you hear like a ding dong at your door and you hear like,
[7459.58s -> 7460.14s]  who is it?
[7465.93s -> 7469.24s]  I'm the pizza delivery gorilla.
[7469.24s -> 7477.62s]  Uh, I just heard that over there. All right. I get, come on in.
[7477.62s -> 7481.54s]  You got, Hey, uh, got, you're in a cool gorilla. So does somebody, you know, is there,
[7481.54s -> 7485.21s]  are you, thanks for the pizza, dude. I didn't order a pizza.
[7491.13s -> 7494.81s]  Let's throw the pizza. Don't throw the fucking pizza at me, dude. Don't, it's like,
[7494.81s -> 7508.30s]  boom, slam the door. How does that always work? Why did I take this down? Oh, wait,
[7508.30s -> 7519.24s]  this makes actually, this kind of makes sense. And it makes sense for one reason
[7519.24s -> 7525.19s]  is that I want the entrance here. No, yeah, I do. This is in the garage.
[7525.19s -> 7528.54s]  That's a perfect entrance. I want it to be tiny though.
[7529.98s -> 7539.06s]  And I actually, no, I can't build on that. Shit. Remember, this would be a 10 out of 10 game.
[7539.06s -> 7543.62s]  If you could get rid of staircases and rebuild them somewhere, we're talking 10.
[7551.91s -> 7554.55s]  No, I can't, I can't do what I wanted to do. So it's okay.
[7555.35s -> 7566.82s]  Put it back. All right. We need to do a Sandy coin.
[7568.97s -> 7578.95s]  Prank shows are ridiculous though. I never like thought about being on a prank. Okay.
[7578.95s -> 7582.23s]  Hi. Here's the thing. How many times do you think you may have been on a prank show that was never
[7582.23s -> 7593.61s]  aired? I think about that. Like the joke didn't work on you. And they kind of just like leave.
[7593.61s -> 7602.49s]  Like how many times have I may have seen somebody in a gorilla suit,
[7603.13s -> 7606.73s]  like running around like screaming and she screams in my face or something. And I'm like,
[7606.73s -> 7610.81s]  Hey, what the fuck? It's not like, Oh, I didn't get them. Just delete that part.
[7627.46s -> 7649.42s]  The shows are fake idiot. All right. We're not talking about like who won on the bachelor.
[7649.42s -> 7657.19s]  We're talking about like a prank video. No, I don't think that they're real. I'm just saying
[7657.27s -> 7672.36s]  I have, I ever been on one. They're fake. You're on one right now.
[7680.79s -> 7687.40s]  Stealable, stealable, stealable, stealable, stealable, extravagant. No, that's not going up here.
[7692.76s -> 7700.49s]  No lights either. Who cares? They'll have to bring a flashlight. Okay. That looks good.
[7701.05s -> 7711.19s]  Somebody said no fridge. Japan refrigerator. No, that's it. That sounds expensive.
[7716.71s -> 7729.75s]  No, why is this a wooden fridge? Okay. Now it's a skin house. I agree with you. Now
[7729.75s -> 7738.14s]  it's a horror movie, human skin furniture in appliance house. This would be scary.
[7740.44s -> 7749.77s]  This would be terrifying without any context on this room. I'm leaving as soon as I get in here.
[7749.77s -> 7760.65s]  The fruit there. Don't touch that fruit. Don't touch that. This is either fake and real. This
[7760.65s -> 7771.24s]  is either fake with a trap on it. Real and poisoned. Don't touch this. Cool. All right.
[7771.24s -> 7785.86s]  Let's go. Let's continue. Wooden. The Pinocchio house. Okay. Let's go. I need doors and windows.
[7788.18s -> 7799.21s]  Roman blinds. Wait, hold on. Can I just put a gigantic curtain here? Please. Please. No,
[7800.09s -> 7817.69s]  I can't just put a big curtain. I guess I could just do a big door frame, right?
[7826.62s -> 7844.71s]  And then hang the curtain on the door frame. I do that. Can I put something in this doorway?
[7845.35s -> 7879.48s]  Just block it with barrels. No barrels. An outside hallway. No. Okay. All right. All right. All
[7879.48s -> 7885.94s]  right. I guess what's the point of this? What's the point of the door frame? It doesn't matter.
[7885.94s -> 7902.20s]  The doors are going to be open anyways. Slime raid. Yeah. Yeah. He's a good streamer.
[7904.58s -> 7921.08s]  You don't know his name. You don't know his name. I haven't told you yet. Where's the raid from?
[7921.08s -> 7941.03s]  What's the channel's name? Okay. I want carpet or wood. Wood on the ground. No carpet. Carpet.
[7941.03s -> 7951.70s]  Carpet. Carpet. Carpet. How about somebody mentioned kitty litter before? There it is.
[7951.70s -> 7983.66s]  Holding the kitty litter. This is an arcade carpet. Not quite. It's kind of. Let's do. Do
[7983.66s -> 8007.46s]  I need any more wall down this way? Yeah. With a door or just like an opening. That's the garage.
[8007.46s -> 8033.69s]  Right. Okay. Hold on. Get rid of this. Absolutely rancid house. School library.
[8039.48s -> 8046.04s]  We talked about wood earlier. This kind of carpet, if you lay down on it, would be like laying down
[8046.04s -> 8062.74s]  on wood. There's nothing there. This is the same thickness as a sticker pack. It's just there so
[8062.74s -> 8074.15s]  the cold concrete doesn't come through. What's going on up here? Cut that out. It pisses me off.
[8074.15s -> 8081.00s]  All right, guys. I fucking just get mad sometimes. This is annoying.
[8081.64s -> 8111.40s]  Dream house is coming along really well, I think. Good. Look. Look. Look. Psycho is going off the
[8111.40s -> 8136.25s]  deep end. Psycho. What? I'm what? You're a psycho. Flesh kitchen, two left doors, explosive nuclear.
[8136.25s -> 8143.08s]  What? Flesh kitchen, two left doors, explosive nuclear barrels in the basement. Looks like a
[8143.08s -> 8147.32s]  good house. Well, you don't know about those barrels yet until you decide to come fucking rob
[8147.32s -> 8173.14s]  me. So this is that concept. So what is this incoming concept? No, no, no. I'm not talking
[8173.14s -> 8187.98s]  about the theme. All right. Let's do this quick. I'll leave that for now. This is the living area.
[8187.98s -> 8199.21s]  Remember I said TV goes right here. I've removed the exact spot where the TV was supposed to go.
[8200.25s -> 8208.34s]  It's okay. The TV can be right here. Yeah, that's fine. Can I please hang one of those
[8208.90s -> 8217.32s]  CRT TVs? Can I hang this? Please tell me I can hang this. I know how to do this. I'm going to
[8217.32s -> 8247.21s]  put a shelf and then put it on the shelf. OK, good. Remember, this is supposed to be a fake IKEA house
[8247.21s -> 8261.26s]  and these are made of plastic. It's not going to fall. It's got lots of back weight. Another DVD
[8261.26s -> 8276.50s]  player. I need hold on. I need some furniture. It's stapled. They always have this really,
[8276.50s -> 8288.28s]  really basic shitty little sofa too. I'm convinced that those like IKEA showroom sofas,
[8288.28s -> 8291.16s]  they're not actually purchasable. I know they have a tag on it, but I feel like they don't
[8291.16s -> 8304.09s]  actually for sale. They are. I know, but I don't know. I feel like that it wouldn't even
[8304.09s -> 8329.00s]  be hates IKEA. I actually like IKEA. I like eating at IKEA. IKEA foods. All right. Oh,
[8329.00s -> 8356.81s]  that's awesome. You got to get that. The meatballs, man. The meatballs are awesome.
[8356.81s -> 8359.61s]  Meatballs, gravy and fries. They actually do. The salmon's there's pretty good.
[8360.94s -> 8379.42s]  They still do a salmon. He hates bits. Oh shit. Did I miss one? I'm doing like a toilet paper
[8379.42s -> 8400.44s]  like seance. OK, big bits. Let's see. Huge actually. Fucking hundred dollars. That's 10,000
[8400.44s -> 8413.22s]  bits. That's an insane amount of money, especially considering that people know now that I don't read
[8413.22s -> 8418.39s]  messages anymore. I cannot believe there are people that are still willing to throw that kind
[8418.39s -> 8431.10s]  of money at me. That's insane. I can't believe you would pay me that much money. This is my dream
[8431.10s -> 8436.94s]  house. No, no, no, no, no, no. But that was from slow. Sorry. Let me say that correctly. That was
[8436.94s -> 8447.75s]  from S10W update. Thank you for the hundred fucking bucks. I've been saving this. I'm grateful for
[8447.75s -> 8457.14s]  the years I spent watching content. I want you to keep that money. OK, if you have an opportunity
[8457.14s -> 8462.02s]  to put a hundred dollars into my bank account or a hundred dollars into your savings account,
[8465.18s -> 8475.24s]  pick the savings account every time. Oh shit, there's a second room. This is both of the bathrooms
[8475.24s -> 8488.36s]  down here. Right, right, right. I would much rather you come to me like four or five months from now
[8489.08s -> 8495.40s]  and be like, oh yeah, I saved a bunch of money and be like, wait, wait, wait, where's my cut?
[8495.40s -> 8507.27s]  You didn't give it to me. I want something else in here. But a hundred dollars is a lot of money.
[8507.67s -> 8515.16s]  And there's a lot of people that have given shit a shitload. That's why I appreciate the
[8515.16s -> 8519.16s]  fact that you're willing to do that. But I hope that you're taking care of yourself first.
[8519.16s -> 8535.11s]  But thank you S10W update. The hundred dollars is a lot of money. Hope I use it well. And they say
[8535.11s -> 8554.15s]  play Bioshock 2. I'll play Bioshock 1 first on the list. Oh my God, play that now. What is
[8554.15s -> 8564.02s]  going on here? What's this? OK, I got to figure out what I want to do with these rooms. I did
[8564.02s -> 8568.42s]  my toilet paper like, got you like, oh yeah, somebody said this is your dream house. It is,
[8568.42s -> 8581.30s]  but not yet. Need a wallpaper. I wish I could just do toilet paper on the walls.
[8607.75s -> 8626.31s]  I want to see what it looks like. Yeah, it is. No, no, it can't be that egregious. You know what
[8626.31s -> 8633.10s]  I mean? It's got to be, I have to at least put a little tongue in cheek here. We're going to go
[8633.10s -> 8662.07s]  with something just decent. It's kind of a living room wallpaper. This one here. Scary music. Turn
[8662.07s -> 8676.07s]  it off. I can't get over the prank house. This really isn't. This is not even a prank house. This
[8676.07s -> 8684.66s]  is a really shitty prank house. I'll come in here. Oh, this went on. What? What? What the heck? That's
[8684.66s -> 8697.74s]  weird. It's kind of an odd thing. Toilet paper. Ha ha ha. In the place of stuff. I'm on TV. I'm on TV.
[8697.74s -> 8740.55s]  Where is it? This is definitely, yeah, this is an I'm on TV house. It's so obvious. I got to change
[8740.55s -> 8747.08s]  this music. This is putting me to sleep. I have mellowed the fuck out so hard since that music's
[8747.08s -> 8764.86s]  been on. It's just, it's, it's, it's, it's just making me chilled out. I'm going to change the music.
[8764.86s -> 8801.14s]  Mario Kart. Nice. That'll do it. Mario Kart. Um, I typed DLC. OST. That's much better. That's that
[8801.22s -> 8809.18s]  room. That's that. We're going to make a, it's going to stay open. That's the concept I'm going
[8809.18s -> 8825.05s]  for. Very good. Louder. I've increased it by 100%. Let's go down here. Looks pretty good. Garage
[8825.05s -> 8849.75s]  door. Got to fix that little gap. I wish I could paint the ceiling. Do I need my couch? Louder. No,
[8849.75s -> 8863.59s]  I don't want to be louder. It's loud enough. Louder. 100% louder. Fine. I'm looking for a couch.
[8863.59s -> 8878.62s]  There it is. It's expensive, but that's the one I'm talking about. This is one of those weird sofas
[8878.62s -> 8896.95s]  that the back is too short and your feet don't touch the ground somehow because you're short.
[8896.95s -> 8904.73s]  No, it's because the cushions too high. There we go. That's leather though. Too expensive.
[8905.45s -> 8918.28s]  It's a nice coffin bed. Why would I want to lie in? I don't want to lie on this panini press.
[8918.28s -> 8933.30s]  This is going to squish me and grill me. I don't want this. This sucks so much that I feel like
[8933.30s -> 8952.06s]  it should be in this house. No, no, I'm just made myself so hungry. It's like a fresh s'more. That's
[8952.06s -> 8956.14s]  hasn't been squished yet and they're going to put the chocolate in it and squish it.
[8956.14s -> 8959.86s]  God damn it. I can't look at that anymore. I can't look at that. It looks like a delicious
[8959.86s -> 8972.10s]  ice cream cake. I might have to get rid of that. It's too delicious looking. Get it out of my house.
[8974.46s -> 8979.82s]  I'm going to go here. The barrels are down there. Let's go over here.
[8980.54s -> 8987.85s]  The wooden thing. I'm fucking wicked nervous now. What's going on?
[8989.94s -> 8994.26s]  Um, I think I'm going to put in the air conditioner downstairs. What's wrong?
[8996.44s -> 9019.53s]  I think I heard the clock up. Did I put more fruit? Faster, faster, faster, faster, faster.
[9025.72s -> 9037.30s]  Now something's really wrong. Whoa, weird house, man. What is this crazy looking thing?
[9037.94s -> 9042.57s]  Not a real clock. Not a real clock. Not a real clock. It's a child's clock. I'm going to die.
[9042.57s -> 9053.90s]  I'm dead. I'm already dead. I've already died because I booked up here. I'm dead. Faster. No,
[9053.90s -> 9059.53s]  slower. All right. I'm going to do whatever. What color is the actual this place going to be?
[9064.65s -> 9093.86s]  White? Not red. Green? I mean, what's wrong with the clock? The clock is backwards? Why? No, it's
[9093.86s -> 9115.22s]  not. Is it one? Well, one, two, it's backwards. It is backwards. That makes it even worse. I don't
[9115.22s -> 9121.05s]  like this. Why do I have to keep playing the music that makes me wicked anxious? I know it's the OST,
[9121.05s -> 9125.29s]  but you do have to have the full soundtrack with when there's 10 seconds left in the game.
[9126.01s -> 9131.69s]  That's one of his songs. I don't want to hear the sped up, scary, you're going to lose song right
[9131.69s -> 9156.02s]  after it. Is that the table? Get this fucking off. But Mario Kart N64 soundtrack. I'm liking
[9156.02s -> 9168.44s]  that one. That's better. It's even wrong in the picture too. All right. What was I doing?
[9174.65s -> 9188.22s]  Oh, it's good. It looks good. I was going to do. Okay. We have furniture. Lock. Did this stay open?
[9191.35s -> 9205.48s]  All right. Color for out here. Let's go with a no bright pink, right? Lavender is way too obvious.
[9206.20s -> 9225.26s]  Heavy green. No, too dark. Way too dark. Select your player.
[9231.16s -> 9243.14s]  Select your level. What's happening? Oh, I've just kind of channeled that. Sorry about that.
[9245.22s -> 9257.45s]  We're going with blood. No, not blood. Not dark lavender. I tried blood red. Let's see what it
[9257.45s -> 9284.17s]  looks like. It's got to be lights in here. Red. You know, you did that voice by sucking in air,
[9284.17s -> 9290.73s]  but I don't know if I can do that right now with my chest. I could, I would really be able to do
[9290.73s -> 9303.14s]  like that. I would be able to do it, but I can't do that right now. Voice lost. Gained. Dr. Fauci
[9303.14s -> 9317.18s]  lost red rum. Damn it. I think that's, I think that's a good, that's a really good trade.
[9322.38s -> 9338.54s]  That's fair. I'll take that a thousand times. All right. Can somebody select a level and pick
[9338.54s -> 9353.96s]  what mode we're going to play? This is also panic inducing. Like, why have you not picked? So why
[9353.96s -> 9360.01s]  have you taken it? It's taking you this long. Pick a level and pick the, please pick a character.
[9363.35s -> 9368.07s]  I've never heard this song for this long and it's freaking me out. I've only heard this song for
[9368.07s -> 9376.74s]  10 straight seconds. Never five minutes. This is an audio sensation I've never had. And it's,
[9376.74s -> 9396.95s]  I, I don't want it anymore. Skip it. I can't. There we are. Oh, my Mia.
[9400.38s -> 9419.29s]  Whoa, you spooked toad. That's what you heard every single time. And then the occasional, uh,
[9423.21s -> 9431.48s]  there's always Luigi too. Oh, Luigi would always get hit by something in the very beginning.
[9431.48s -> 9435.80s]  Nobody even had to run over one of those cubes. Luigi just got hurt every time.
[9436.60s -> 9456.89s]  You would hear his, I got hit sound from across the game. Do the toad, do toad falling off the
[9456.89s -> 9460.49s]  map. I, that's what I think it is. It's a Tasmanian devil where I have to go all out for it.
[9461.21s -> 9481.30s]  This is only one way you do that. This is going to be hard to do. If I nailed this.
[9494.04s -> 9498.60s]  Nope. I tried twice. Hard. Let's try it one more time. Oh, I won't do it again. I can't,
[9499.32s -> 9528.52s]  I can't do it. I cannot do it. Good effort. Yeah. Make a painting noise. Should this be,
[9528.52s -> 9543.91s]  wait, this room's supposed to be blood red. I can probably do it without yelling.
[9550.04s -> 9560.31s]  You can't unless you can't. It's not possible. You have to, when you say, when you say,
[9561.99s -> 9565.75s]  out loud, you have to be that person's actual voice. Nobody can do that.
[9570.01s -> 9584.92s]  No, that was not the worst noise. 2028 over yet. All right. It's not, it wasn't. No, no, no,
[9584.92s -> 9603.24s]  it wasn't. I can't hold on. I have so much trouble. I need to paint these walls blue.
[9603.88s -> 9611.18s]  That's why I don't listen to music. You guys know the secret, the real reason why I don't
[9611.18s -> 9618.94s]  listen to music because my ADHD brain and not listen to it, I have to focus on it. And when
[9618.94s -> 9627.83s]  I focus on it, I lose, I lose complete everything. All I can see right now in my mind, I can't see
[9627.83s -> 9635.08s]  anything or hear anything else besides the banjo. That's, that's the, I'm playing it visually on the
[9635.08s -> 9679.90s]  screen. Okay. We fixed it. Mr. Spot. Did I? Somebody said I was trying, didn't finish the
[9679.90s -> 9704.20s]  blue room. What? I don't like that. What should be over here? It's good. This looks good.
[9704.84s -> 9729.78s]  Put a bunch of trash in here. Turn this shit off. I was reading what somebody said. Okay. Let's go
[9729.78s -> 9737.64s]  to paint. Now this all can stay the same. I just need some junk in here. Is it just like a junk
[9737.64s -> 9777.22s]  category? I see. Definitely need one of these. Make it less loud. We go. Okay. Cool. I like it.
[9777.78s -> 9786.52s]  Just needs to, should it just go all the way around? People paint their garages white. Yeah,
[9786.52s -> 9820.66s]  just white. So funky. And it's a low volume funky. This is the Aqua teen house.
[9821.54s -> 9824.34s]  I'm trying to get away from the Aqua teen house. It's not the Aqua teen house.
[9831.54s -> 9862.02s]  It is, but maybe a little. You made the Aqua teen house through muscle reflexes. That's so funny to
[9862.02s -> 9868.68s]  me because that means I've done this potentially thousands of times. Am I such a huge Aqua teen
[9868.68s -> 9878.14s]  fan? I gotta, I gotta get it right one day. I did not make the Aqua teen house through muscle
[9878.14s -> 9909.86s]  memory. I haven't seen an episode of that show in probably five years. I have paint. Yeah. Good.
[9909.86s -> 9920.57s]  Let's put some of the just very, very, very normal stuff to have in your. Yeah. Let's put some,
[9921.13s -> 9932.76s]  some junk. Junk works. Get junk. Other. What have we got in the other category?
[9934.38s -> 9944.62s]  Should we put a safe with toilet paper in it? Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[9946.86s -> 9953.06s]  No, absolutely not. I mean, this, this has to be, this has to have money in it.
[9955.10s -> 9960.42s]  Right. For this to work, like, oh, there's nothing in here, but there's like a dollar,
[9960.42s -> 9990.28s]  just $2 in here. Spoon. I can't put the spoon in there. Oh shit. This is an FPS house.
[9993.86s -> 9998.74s]  Like, okay, I come in here. Oh, look, there's like an item over here in the item spot.
[10000.04s -> 10008.41s]  Oh, it's like 10 ammo. Weird fucked up kitchen. Like guy, like up two monsters. Boom, boom. Like,
[10009.53s -> 10013.77s]  turn this way. Like somebody jumps through here. Weird clock and weird room.
[10017.27s -> 10030.01s]  And then into the garage down the stairs. I did, I did it already. This is what makes it that like
[10033.34s -> 10050.55s]  whatever the pub G house. There you go. Good. It's a pub G house. You missed a spot.
[10055.40s -> 10068.23s]  Oops. Add purple loot. I mean, I could probably put like images on the ground, like paintings on
[10068.23s -> 10075.70s]  the ground of just like Fortnite weapons, but then that becomes a full on FPS house. And we're not
[10075.70s -> 10085.16s]  there. We're not doing that. Like have this open and have to be like three or four purple items on
[10085.16s -> 10113.85s]  the ground. Good. All right. No more paint backyard gas back here. What happened over here? Oh, right.
[10113.85s -> 10131.37s]  I was going to project for a different day. I think this is good. I think this works. Welcome.
[10135.30s -> 10138.95s]  This paint's got to change though. All right. What can you see when you look in here?
[10139.75s -> 10164.81s]  Something to steal. It's flawed. It's flawed. It can't be in here. Let's make that better.
[10165.45s -> 10185.98s]  They spoke fluorescent. How do you spell for more? S fluorescent. You is a you first. It's
[10185.98s -> 10197.26s]  flora fluorescent. Okay. I was close. Oh man. Oh no. I thought this was a play bar.
[10198.22s -> 10202.06s]  Like the video was supposed to be up here. And there's like, this is the play bar.
[10202.06s -> 10221.27s]  I was like, what did I click on? You get one light. You redditor. I'm not, that's why I'm not
[10221.27s -> 10229.34s]  making a joke. I'm not, that's not a joke. I promise you that you can believe one thing today.
[10229.34s -> 10241.37s]  It's not me making a joke. It's like, it's trying to load an ad. It's an image of a TV on the wall.
[10242.01s -> 10257.19s]  It's not a bad idea. I don't use fluorescence. There's not even a light switch. I think we're
[10257.27s -> 10260.95s]  done with the upstairs. This is one space here, which I guess we could put like
[10261.59s -> 10267.35s]  expensive stuff in the walls. How about this? Very like a, it was like a cabinet.
[10267.91s -> 10301.14s]  It was way too nice. This really is making an FPS in something that's not a video game engine.
[10305.29s -> 10319.05s]  You know what I mean? Like this wasn't made in unreal. This was made in a video game that uses
[10319.13s -> 10340.95s]  unreal. Put guns. That is unreal. No, no, I think you're missing what I'm saying. It's not unreal.
[10340.95s -> 10345.35s]  You don't open like unreal engine and go in the engine and make a game. You make the game
[10345.35s -> 10355.72s]  in the game that already exists, but that game is using assets from unreal engine. Like, like,
[10355.72s -> 10375.06s]  like Gary's mod or something. You don't like going in code in the engine. He's rambling. What? What
[10375.06s -> 10382.07s]  are you talking about? Like I'm talking about like a game maker studio for or something not
[10382.07s -> 10389.99s]  unreal. You don't like make this in unreal engine. Actually you do code. All code is in engine.
[10392.55s -> 10396.07s]  He's not wrong. I feel like I'm questioning my whole life right now.
[10409.14s -> 10417.03s]  Stop bragging. I think it's time to start my house. What do you think? We'll do some,
[10417.03s -> 10426.90s]  we'll tidy up upstairs. Why is it so dirty over here? Why is it so dirty down here?
[10426.90s -> 10449.50s]  I had to change it. All right. This is going to be my real house. This is my real bathroom.
[10450.14s -> 10463.00s]  This is my real house here. Get to work. You come in here. Ball. What's in the way?
[10473.30s -> 10488.86s]  FPS boss fight. It's not a boss fight. Okay. We're fine. I'm the boss. Do I do what? Do I just stand
[10488.86s -> 10495.72s]  down here? I really am making an FPS fucking level. No, this is supposed to be like trick.
[10496.04s -> 10501.48s]  This is the prank house. This is trick the guy to come in here. The guy comes in here. You're
[10501.48s -> 10507.08s]  tricking him with all kinds of weird tricks. He finally makes it around here. He gets down to you.
[10507.08s -> 10511.72s]  This is a level. That's a level. You try to stop the main character from coming down to your like
[10511.72s -> 10528.46s]  secret stash of stuff that you have behind you. And you're the guy with like the gun. What happened?
[10528.46s -> 10539.90s]  Okay. I'm ready to damn it. My vision. Yo dude, Charles entertainment cheese is streaming.
[10548.65s -> 10561.14s]  I hope so. That'd be like funny. Okay. Furniture. I need a huge bed. How many rooms should my
[10561.14s -> 10583.03s]  house be? Is this this? This can be over here. This is going to turn the room before the room.
[10583.67s -> 10593.77s]  How much space do I get? This is a, this is a room here. This is a room here.
[10594.33s -> 10600.97s]  But this is a room here. Okay. Right here. I got to block this out and then I can look at it later
[10600.97s -> 10610.20s]  and figure it out. Bathroom here. There's going to be a door there, which leads into this room,
[10610.92s -> 10627.06s]  which then this is a hallway. Then this is a room. All right. Let's figure this out. Bathroom,
[10627.94s -> 10645.27s]  the door here, right here. That looks good. You got to go. Have a good stream. Well, thanks for
[10645.27s -> 10658.92s]  coming. Hope your day is filled pleasantries. All right. That's where doors can go. And then this is
[10659.00s -> 10663.91s]  a door is going to go. Where am I? Wait, what is that? What room is this?
[10665.58s -> 10685.24s]  Okay. That's bathroom. Okay. Right here. This is making me irrationally angry that it's not
[10685.24s -> 10693.88s]  right here. The door has to line up with this door, fill the basement with mirrors. I cannot
[10693.88s -> 10706.92s]  do mirrors again. I will puke. That looks fine. You go through here. There's a hallway here. This
[10706.92s -> 10748.38s]  leads to here. And then this is a room. Bathroom, room, hallway, room. Wait. Okay.
[10750.54s -> 10760.01s]  So this is a hallway here. I'm going to have to put a med pack right there. This is my room.
[10760.01s -> 10772.50s]  This is the bathroom. It's all leading to the bathroom. You're making an airsoft house now.
[10779.06s -> 10796.78s]  I don't know if that means, but I think it's funny. Door, door, door, internal door. Get out of the
[10796.78s -> 10840.87s]  way. Cool. All right. Kind of weird how it opens. This is rainbow road. Yep. What happened? What's
[10840.87s -> 10885.78s]  down? How does it look wrong? Okay. We heard one that went through once. Turn it down. Look,
[10885.78s -> 10926.10s]  this is the electric guitar part. Okay. Door. All right. Let's go. God, this is to go to the
[10926.10s -> 10936.09s]  bathroom. Honestly, I don't even need to have a door on the bathroom. I can make this a super
[10936.09s -> 10966.76s]  bathroom. Somebody said this is a filler house. Filler house. I love that term. God,
[10968.17s -> 11023.00s]  get out of here. This is the shower. Fuck. Did anyone know what this is called? What
[11023.00s -> 11029.14s]  is this noise called? I hear it everywhere. And I never, what do you search for? Like
[11029.78s -> 11056.49s]  keyboard sound. There's no way. What is it called? I don't know how this is somehow worse than the
[11056.49s -> 11060.66s]  mirror house to me. Yeah. This is worse than the mirror house. I don't like it down here.
[11061.22s -> 11075.88s]  This is supposed to be my dream house. It's unsettling. It is. It's really unsettling. I
[11075.88s -> 11087.66s]  don't like it. It's making me wicked uncomfortable. Or maybe it's the Baldi's basics thing in the
[11087.66s -> 11100.81s]  background. Why are we going so fast? No, I don't, I have to get rid of this. I'm just actually going
[11100.81s -> 11119.69s]  to hurt my head. We're going to keep this. That was, there was another three or four minutes on that.
[11131.21s -> 11141.40s]  Now I made an FPS house, but this is a really, this is not even a good FPS level. I forgot to
[11141.40s -> 11163.67s]  remove some of this stuff when I was making the game puzzle game. No, I'll make it. I'm no dream
[11163.67s -> 11176.98s]  house. That's fine. Take this down. Did he make another joke house? So halfway, half joke house.
[11177.86s -> 11198.34s]  Now this is real house. I want to actually make my stuff awesome down here. There's the door
[11198.98s -> 11205.78s]  member. It's supposed to be a secret. So when you come in here, this room here is just storage.
[11207.19s -> 11241.69s]  Like a closet. This is the house. Welcome. All right. Sort by, uh, price. Welcome. Okay. Let's do
[11241.69s -> 11260.62s]  floor search, search by price. Ooh, I like this little explosive. I don't know. We're going to
[11260.62s -> 11271.78s]  get into these brick walls. Walls are killing it for me. My perfect wall. I'm being serious.
[11273.14s -> 11288.87s]  My absolute, my go-to, the wall I actually like is gray, gray, beige. No, no, no. I once like,
[11288.87s -> 11303.78s]  what was that? Silver gray, silver Galatia. Look at that. It looks so nice. You're boring.
[11305.13s -> 11317.59s]  That's fine. But I actually truly enjoy, uh, shades of gray. The best part about gray is there,
[11317.67s -> 11329.66s]  there are so many shades. You get a blue, light blue. It's like, you can put gray,
[11329.66s -> 11337.72s]  like brown, gray, beige. Yeah. There's about 50. I'd say there's probably 50. I'm a huge fan of
[11337.72s -> 11355.66s]  all the 50. Big fan. I didn't, I didn't even complete it. I didn't even, you know,
[11355.66s -> 11360.86s]  I didn't even want to complete it because it was so easy. I didn't want to complete it. You guys did.
[11360.86s -> 11377.86s]  That's fine. I didn't, I'm not going to complete that one. All right. Looking good. I actually
[11377.86s -> 11390.60s]  believe that though. I truly do believe that I like gray. I like all the shades of gray. I like
[11390.60s -> 11412.89s]  blue gray. I like brown gray. I like them. There are two different grays. Prove it. Eat gray on
[11412.89s -> 11428.10s]  stream. I don't think I would want to eat anything gray on stream because the gray is like mold.
[11430.65s -> 11442.22s]  All right. I don't like the floors. Floors have to change. Floor panels and covering.
[11442.78s -> 11446.65s]  All right. So the most expensive thing is this carpet. I don't like that carpet.
[11449.16s -> 11462.60s]  What is it? How is wood more expensive? How is wood less expensive than carpet? Perfect. In a
[11462.60s -> 11493.67s]  perfect world, this would be tile. It is. It will be tile. I'm sorry everybody. Just let me get a
[11493.67s -> 11512.81s]  look at it first before everybody freaks out. This is not a perfect world. Come on here.
[11513.45s -> 11527.19s]  Expensive. I would definitely, this is what I would want, but I can't set how many, how big I want it.
[11527.75s -> 11552.49s]  This is a normie house. So it's a normal house. It's a regular house. What kind of house do you
[11552.49s -> 11562.47s]  want to live in? I mean, we made the joke about like having discovery zone in your backyard, but
[11562.47s -> 11587.74s]  is that, is that so weird to want just to live in a normal house? This is for later. Can I not put
[11587.74s -> 11610.79s]  this anywhere? Okay. What's the most expensive fireplace? Okay. Here we go. Galactic sauna heater.
[11610.79s -> 11616.23s]  Electric fireplace. Yeah. Look at this. And it's already gray. I don't even have to do anything.
[11616.31s -> 11625.50s]  I won't. No, I'd like the smoky gray. That looks so good. Dude. Oh my God. Give it to me today.
[11626.38s -> 11631.42s]  Where can I pick this up? Where can I pick this up? I want that. Look at how, look at that.
[11634.26s -> 11663.03s]  Oh, so angular and there's so much like the material. I love like that shiny stone. Don't
[11663.03s -> 11690.33s]  you just want to live inside of that? Beautiful. Okay. I need some shelving furniture. We need a
[11691.05s -> 11697.56s]  most expensive, awesome ass couch. This one, but I don't want to, I don't want to blue.
[11709.70s -> 11737.00s]  It's actually pretty good. That looks good. It's bigger than it looks in the picture. One, two,
[11737.00s -> 11741.00s]  three, four, five, six, seven. When am I ever expecting seven people to come over?
[11742.55s -> 11766.84s]  Wait, can this be saved? Yeah, I can. Hold on for those cold nights. You know what I mean?
[11767.48s -> 11815.46s]  I need a place to sleep. Yeah, I know. I know this is an evil guy bed. This is an evil sorcerer bed,
[11816.10s -> 11901.03s]  but it's the most expensive thing. I won. Nice. This is my dream house. That means I have a fixture
[11901.03s -> 11908.22s]  built into the structure. That is a bathroom that I can go take a shit and play video games on. Like
[11908.22s -> 11927.38s]  I used to do when I was like a kid, used to what, what question marks when I was, when I was younger
[11927.38s -> 11933.62s]  up until probably, I was like 20. Whenever like laptops became small enough to use, I used to
[11933.62s -> 11939.30s]  bring my entire computer into the bathroom and set the whole thing up and just be on the computer
[11939.30s -> 11946.25s]  and play games and shit while I took a shit. And then I had to take all of it out. And after I was
[11946.25s -> 11952.47s]  satisfied and done going and I was, it was over the daunting task of now I have to redo my whole
[11952.47s -> 11967.66s]  computer setup for like maybe like an hour and 12 minutes worth of enjoyment. Not anymore because
[11967.66s -> 11974.38s]  now this is my dream home. This is permanent here. This is a dedicated computer in here.
[11974.38s -> 11983.58s]  I don't think there'll be two computers. Sorry that you don't know that. And there's a little
[11983.66s -> 12002.97s]  heater right there. Monitor. Am I writing Minotaur? Monitor. He told us this story. Yeah,
[12002.97s -> 12011.50s]  but I never made it in my dream house. Okay. Wait, I need this. I need a little stool.
[12031.46s -> 12081.06s]  Now you've lost. Really? Like a little corner table. Come on, man. What's this even doing in
[12081.06s -> 12109.61s]  here? That's not in my dream house. Okay. This is for like drinks and shit for the mouse and keyboard
[12110.17s -> 12147.83s]  right here. Toilet. Toilet plumbing system. Toilet. Okay. How long is this?
[12150.09s -> 12207.48s]  Skip next please. Yep. A little bit more to the left. Damn it. Damn it. I gotta move the,
[12207.48s -> 12215.83s]  I gotta move the toilet. No, I don't. This can be different. Doesn't have to be the same.
[12215.83s -> 12234.25s]  Just need a little thing. How about this? How big is this? The ultimate gamer throne. Get in there.
[12234.81s -> 12253.85s]  For the wall? No, it doesn't need to be that big. Just need a little thing. A little tiny little
[12253.85s -> 12273.26s]  thing. Got it. Perfect. Perfect reach too. You see? If you're sitting here, your arm is right there.
[12274.14s -> 12298.06s]  Here's the next part of this. How do you get in here reliably? I know. You just drag it.
[12298.06s -> 12302.73s]  It stores over here. And then when you're ready to go to the bathroom, you like,
[12303.69s -> 12329.29s]  ah, just slide it over. And keyboard. Look at that. And the keyboard will just sit on my lap.
[12329.29s -> 12360.94s]  Here's a couple of drinks. Maybe dinner. Food. Go. Okay, go. Okay, go. Yeah, look at this. And I
[12360.94s -> 12365.26s]  could just sit down. There's the mouse. Keyboard right on the lap. I could even get like a little
[12365.26s -> 12381.74s]  keyboard tray if I really wanted to. I need a shower, don't I? Oh, well, I need a shower.
[12382.38s -> 12409.21s]  You can still get in and out. Just my sodas. Drinks. Soda. Um, water? Like, what would it
[12409.21s -> 12430.92s]  even be under? Why the walls have changed? Well, I think the walls have to be white.
[12432.36s -> 12460.36s]  Like, teeth white. Colgate white. Yeah, I already like it better. Painting is
[12461.77s -> 12469.56s]  part of, is bad for back support? No, I don't like, this is public bathroom vibe. I don't like that.
[12472.20s -> 12474.76s]  Green tile in bathroom always means public bathroom.
[12492.15s -> 12497.02s]  You're just painting over the tiles. Yeah, it's a video game. It's okay.
[12497.90s -> 12511.03s]  That'd be pretty messed up. I agree. Oh, no. Now it's just a not rendered room.
[12511.91s -> 12540.78s]  No, this has to change too. Wall. Foot looks good. These? Try these. But I'll do what they did.
[12540.78s -> 12594.63s]  Why does it look like they made it a colored pencil? This is a Yoshi's Island wall? Hold on,
[12594.63s -> 12604.01s]  I gotta put these down. It's supposed to be two. One. Two. I'm gonna fix it. Don't worry.
[12604.81s -> 12617.22s]  Here Mario. I baked you a delicious cake. If you, uh, uh, peach from Mario 64 is Mickey Mouse.
[12632.15s -> 12648.54s]  I have some kind of Mario syndrome, right? It's like, I, I, I've read like a book and Mario music
[12648.54s -> 12662.68s]  is now like, here I go. I do it now. One, two, one. Wait, I'll say here we go either. Here we go.
[12664.25s -> 12680.12s]  Here we go. I have to go. I gotta get out of here. One. You'll, I promise you'll like this when it's
[12680.12s -> 12686.42s]  done. You don't walk into a construction before it's even close and say, this looks ugly. Like,
[12686.42s -> 12714.36s]  yeah, dude. Cause I'm not even fucking done. Bathroom is mad stinky. I can't, I hate that you
[12714.36s -> 12746.90s]  wrote that. Move you. That was the equivalent of hitting my thumb. But if this were real life,
[12746.90s -> 12767.94s]  I would have wished I hit my thumb because I just might've destroyed the house. Okay. So this is one,

[16638.50s -> 16645.50s]  was shining brightly like it is right there and you lived in this house that
[16645.50s -> 16653.81s]  what would that do he's doing the mirror house thing again oh yeah shit I can't
[16653.81s -> 16659.17s]  do that again I know like an invisible house is funny but I don't want to sit
[16659.17s -> 16677.13s]  here for an hour and 20 minutes doing this it would catch on fire and let's
[16677.13s -> 16693.20s]  do one guy in chat save this stream sure all right now let's do outdoor paint to
[16693.20s -> 16699.74s]  make it really just gray and boring maybe not maybe that maybe this is the
[16699.74s -> 16710.15s]  fake part of the house we're gonna do this kit is white how much is white how
[16710.15s -> 16727.26s]  boring does this look plaid Mayo house did you guys know I just recently learned
[16727.30s -> 16731.98s]  this do you know that if something is called Mayo it doesn't actually have to
[16731.98s -> 16739.00s]  be mayonnaise to truly call your product mayonnaise and it's actually really
[16739.00s -> 16744.09s]  mayonnaise it has to have a specific set of ingredients if you call something
[16744.09s -> 16749.80s]  Mayo it could be pretty close but it's not actually mayonnaise if you see like
[16749.80s -> 16753.96s]  oh like you check out this one light Mayo that's not mayonnaise it's
[16753.96s -> 16759.75s]  legally not mayonnaise it needs to be a certain amount of egg yep there I'm gonna
[16759.95s -> 16767.02s]  certain amount of oil I did not know that I was marketing tricks forever I
[16767.02s -> 16796.65s]  thought that Mayo was just mayonnaise cool random fact XD man oh come on that
[16796.65s -> 16803.84s]  is like a kind of interesting fact come on man that's a kind that's pretty
[16803.84s -> 16807.24s]  interesting I didn't know that as of like a few days ago that's interesting
[16807.24s -> 16832.69s]  that's an interesting thing because I said it yeah if like Bill Nye was on
[16832.69s -> 16835.53s]  camera right now talking about how mayonnaise and mayo are not the same
[16835.53s -> 16839.26s]  thing and he had like a bunch of test tubes and those glasses on you'd be
[16839.26s -> 16858.30s]  like oh cool but I say it and I'm a weirdo you don't you don't have a
[16858.30s -> 16900.72s]  science music there is no music this is birds let's change that so sucks it
[16900.72s -> 16905.14s]  like really does something look like mayonnaise it looks like a big
[16905.14s -> 16912.22s]  marshmallow I don't really want to get on the
[16912.22s -> 16924.82s]  scaffolding so I think it's gonna stay yellow mayonnaise isn't white it's it is
[16924.86s -> 16929.26s]  but it's slightly it's a little it's like a it's a kind of a cream color
[16929.26s -> 16940.68s]  isn't it it's a little bit on the yellow side isn't it not pure white who
[16940.68s -> 17010.92s]  needs it yeah I need a scaffolding don't think I do I'll do the other side
[17029.84s -> 17034.92s]  you ever just stand outside and listen to birds and then actually sit there
[17034.92s -> 17039.68s]  and go I'll just sit in the background this is so loud and there's so many of
[17039.68s -> 17055.52s]  them it's not until you really sit there and listen for 10 seconds and go holy
[17055.52s -> 17076.54s]  shit what is it pac-man dying sounds it's a sorting algorithm Galaga it is
[17076.54s -> 17085.76s]  Galaga all right what fucking weird bird is this I need to find out what the what
[17085.76s -> 17097.40s]  the Galaga bird is hold on pause everything turn them off turn off of
[17097.40s -> 17108.04s]  where's the other one coming from okay what is that world's weirdest bird dusky
[17108.04s -> 17115.64s]  grouse no what is it crested or okay this is apparently what the crested
[17115.64s -> 17139.64s]  oro pendola sounds like that's crazy I can't believe that that's unbelievable
[17139.64s -> 17145.59s]  show a bird show bird rested on one I gotta get a good photo it's kind of
[17145.59s -> 17167.38s]  bald it's got a bald head look that's what it looks like
[17167.62s -> 17199.10s]  I'm gonna put it on stream this is what's making that noise it's bald let's
[17199.10s -> 17214.66s]  say that one more time bird watching stream holy shit what an incredible idea
[17214.66s -> 17219.98s]  I would go out there with like telephoto lens and try to capture birds and stuff
[17219.98s -> 17240.38s]  gone on image I mean I love that idea you get bored really quick yeah but I
[17240.38s -> 17247.12s]  did build a bird house on stream and how long was that stream like three hours
[17247.12s -> 17260.28s]  four hours right was eight it was eight hours okay if I if I build a bird house
[17260.28s -> 17269.88s]  for eight hours I can watch birds before you do it was a full workday to do one
[17269.88s -> 17283.57s]  bird house yesterday not everything needs to be streamed today bird watching
[17283.57s -> 17290.36s]  is a go I think that has to be streamed I think that's something that's been
[17290.36s -> 17305.26s]  important to be streamed put a picture of that bird in the house I don't even
[17305.30s -> 17311.72s]  know that bird is but I don't even know what kind of bird that is now I like my
[17311.72s -> 17326.02s]  city painting thing the problem with bird watching at least I mean around
[17326.02s -> 17336.40s]  here it's there's not birds like that around here this chickadees and I mean
[17336.40s -> 17343.32s]  there are roadrunners out here though and those are awesome so it would turn
[17343.32s -> 17349.61s]  into a road running watching stream and Ravens there's like these big-ass crows
[17349.65s -> 17356.12s]  and Ravens out here like Hawks and Condors and there's a lot of cool birds
[17356.12s -> 17374.81s]  out here what am I talking about let's do it 30 hours in he's still on the
[17374.81s -> 17391.44s]  Aqua teen house not the Aqua teen house anymore come on here would be a good
[17391.44s -> 17402.63s]  stream I'm what I'll do it I'm looking forward to it I have to find the right
[17402.63s -> 17407.72s]  equipment to be able to have you guys able to watch some type of telephoto
[17407.72s -> 17411.12s]  lens that I can get real close in or like a binocular thing that can be fed
[17411.12s -> 17417.47s]  to a stream because if I go bird watching that means I have to do on
[17417.51s -> 17427.07s]  location like IRL backpack type shit right how would I connect I got a
[17427.07s -> 17436.80s]  kind of like a lens that sounds expensive that's alright if it's if it's
[17436.80s -> 17454.04s]  worth it to stream you know the story hold it a few times tell it again but I
[17454.04s -> 17460.08s]  liquidated my retirement account to do the German rumble that that's what I
[17460.08s -> 17472.96s]  mean like it was worth doing I'm gonna do it just watch bird videos instead
[17472.96s -> 17485.74s]  that's not that that's not the row that's gonna be the real thing well all
[17485.78s -> 17491.15s]  right cool connect camera would be a USB to a laptop and use the webcam to see
[17491.15s -> 17502.12s]  on a PC no I'm not gonna aim the webcam and the laptop at a bird I would need to
[17502.12s -> 17506.98s]  use I need to get like a camera hold holding it up and like pointing the
[17506.98s -> 17514.71s]  laptop webcam you would see nothing it would be so pixelated and horrible
[17514.71s -> 17527.00s]  GoPros maybe I feel like I would be the unlucky asshole that had a GoPro attached
[17527.00s -> 17532.48s]  to his head and a camera and I ended up getting chased by a rhino it would be
[17532.48s -> 17541.63s]  just a horrible footage of me just running away screaming that happened
[17541.63s -> 17561.51s]  this room's got to change this room's terrible I don't know rhinos and there's
[17561.51s -> 17568.78s]  no rhinos native to Las Vegas no there aren't I don't know maybe who knows a
[17568.78s -> 17576.23s]  bigfoot apparently still exists and no one's been able to see him that doesn't
[17576.23s -> 17583.71s]  mean he can't kill you they've been looking for him for a long time and he's
[17583.71s -> 17621.63s]  still he's kills people in the woods hmm let's go in cabinets cabinet
[17621.63s -> 17629.72s]  teleporter they're not symmetrical it cares table need like a little runner
[17629.72s -> 17639.52s]  like a runner table mm-hmm one of these one of these one of these I just thought
[17639.52s -> 17647.46s]  a tuna sandwich tuna salad and I wanted one now right now something about the
[17647.46s -> 17656.76s]  mayonnaise shit from earlier how big is this it's way too big
[17660.66s -> 17682.93s]  did I make a trail of porn magazines into the room who am I trying to catch
[17682.93s -> 17707.65s]  by the way with this no this room now has a completely different context that
[17707.65s -> 17712.23s]  I don't want any I thought I wanted to be just like the weird porn room in the
[17712.23s -> 17718.03s]  basement of your house it's hidden down here it was supposed to be my dream
[17718.03s -> 17727.40s]  house but it's actually just the hidden like pornographic theater get rid of all

[19302.18s -> 19305.61s]  at that room anymore I can't look at this room anymore it has a completely

[19449.70s -> 19454.15s]  save though that's a great question I don't think it really matters
[19454.15s -> 19460.37s]  considering we didn't do anything for about the last 32 straight minutes so
[19460.37s -> 19471.37s]  there's no there's no improvements or problems I have I still have the 3DO I
[19471.37s -> 19474.25s]  got to pull that out there's at least three or four games on the 3DO that we
[19474.25s -> 19498.88s]  have to play only custom robo matters yeah we're good look
