[1.78s -> 12.65s]  Odd watchers, go back and watch Die Dallas encounter. I didn't say it, you did. Somebody did. Someone. Someone is.
[13.29s -> 15.78s]  You're gonna die over a handful of chickens.
[16.71s -> 17.91s]  Someone is.
[17.91s -> 27.13s]  Hi guys. Say Die Dallas the right way, please.
[30.01s -> 34.50s]  Um, Daedalus? Daedalus?
[35.62s -> 38.74s]  Spell it out phonetically for me. Daedalus?
[40.86s -> 42.30s]  Bugsnax?
[42.30s -> 44.30s]  Did I say it right?
[44.84s -> 46.65s]  Bugsnax.
[46.65s -> 54.23s]  Daedalus. That wasn't Mr. Satan.
[55.64s -> 59.24s]  No, it wasn't Mr. Satan. That was supposed to be like a half goofy.
[61.64s -> 66.70s]  Daed- Daed- Hold on, somebody has it here. Daedalus.
[67.72s -> 69.10s]  Daedalus.
[69.10s -> 70.78s]  The Daedalus encounter.
[70.78s -> 75.37s]  Now the Die Dallas is way better.
[75.37s -> 79.05s]  You guys ever get a word in your head that you pronounce wrong and you know it's not correct?
[79.45s -> 83.29s]  But you don't care because it's in your your own headcanon and that's how you pronounce it.
[83.93s -> 89.62s]  That happens frequently with me.
[92.14s -> 95.66s]  This game is just putting ketchup on ants. Stop.
[96.55s -> 98.15s]  That's kind of weird.
[98.15s -> 100.86s]  Ketchup on ants.
[100.86s -> 102.86s]  Fantasy book characters? Yeah.
[106.38s -> 108.38s]  Please eat my yummy bugs.
[109.82s -> 113.94s]  Yuck.
[113.94s -> 118.74s]  There's hot sauce. Wait, do you actually eat bugs in this game? Is this an actual bug eating video game?
[119.22s -> 121.94s]  I thought that was just the name.
[121.94s -> 123.94s]  Yes, you do. You eat insects.
[124.90s -> 126.98s]  I guess the game is called Bug Snacks.
[127.54s -> 130.36s]  It's not called like Bug Trapper.
[131.77s -> 134.49s]  Or Bug Farm. It's called Bug Snacks.
[136.70s -> 141.18s]  This game is dumb.
[141.18s -> 142.30s]  All right.
[142.30s -> 146.54s]  People, this was really requested. And plus it came out like what, last week?
[151.67s -> 153.46s]  And?
[153.46s -> 155.77s]  Ten million dollars
[155.77s -> 157.77s]  off the debt if he eats a real bug.
[159.85s -> 162.49s]  No, we're in pre-streamed chat. We're talking about this.
[163.53s -> 168.49s]  I'm not into the whole like eat bugs on camera and scream and cry and stuff when you're eating them.
[168.81s -> 170.57s]  Why do we think that's cool?
[170.57s -> 172.81s]  That's so strange. That's like bizarre and terrible.
[174.41s -> 178.73s]  For this challenge, you need to eat 12 scorpions in 15 seconds.
[181.10s -> 182.22s]  Why?
[182.22s -> 186.73s]  It's not like it's horrible. That sucks. It probably hurts.
[187.45s -> 192.38s]  And the person's just going like, no, I can't.
[195.74s -> 200.38s]  And then you're sitting on the couch going, yeah, cry. Cry, bitch.
[201.61s -> 203.29s]  What's wrong with people?
[203.29s -> 207.30s]  Why do we think that's interesting? That's like horrible.
[207.30s -> 209.30s]  Why would, why do people think that's cool?
[215.16s -> 217.40s]  I don't know, man. I don't think I could eat another cockroach.
[218.60s -> 222.68s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. You'll choke on that fucking cockroach, you piece of shit.
[223.32s -> 226.34s]  Where's the entertainment?
[226.34s -> 227.94s]  What's the value there?
[227.94s -> 239.98s]  Dude, stop. I'm not trying to get.
[241.70s -> 243.70s]  Jesus Christ.
[245.58s -> 248.54s]  Eating bugs is, all right. Oh, let's go.
[249.34s -> 254.44s]  We just got 50 bucks from, well, I say we, but I mean me.
[255.32s -> 257.16s]  We got, why is everything we? You know what I mean?
[257.24s -> 259.24s]  Okay. Are we going to, what are we going to do here?
[259.88s -> 264.04s]  We just got 50 bucks come in. No, that doesn't work like that, Jeremy.
[267.19s -> 270.55s]  Okay. So what are we going to do? You notice how a lot of streamers and YouTubers, we do that.
[271.67s -> 273.67s]  Well, it doesn't work. It doesn't work with the money part.
[276.68s -> 278.68s]  Split it.
[280.31s -> 284.79s]  No, no, that was 5,000 bits from Lucas, the unknown. Thank you, Lucas.
[286.26s -> 289.70s]  And Lucas says my first ever donation to any streamer. Thanks for being here.
[289.70s -> 292.39s]  And then I will always support you.
[292.39s -> 294.47s]  First ever donation. And it's a huge one.
[294.95s -> 300.44s]  Thanks, dude. For the massive bit drop.
[305.70s -> 310.28s]  First ever donation.
[310.28s -> 314.33s]  Give me my penny.
[314.33s -> 319.90s]  Your bit rate, what?
[319.90s -> 323.50s]  One bit per, all right. Can I talk about something for just a quick second?
[325.00s -> 327.48s]  You just reminded me of something.
[327.48s -> 328.44s]  Okay.
[328.44s -> 331.48s]  So there are, there are class action lawsuits, right?
[332.12s -> 335.48s]  Where some company, I got something in the mail.
[336.44s -> 338.60s]  Like, I don't know, like maybe a year ago.
[338.60s -> 343.32s]  And it's like, oh, I just want to let you know that you're the class action lawsuit for this you've been a part of.
[343.80s -> 349.32s]  Yeah, they won. They won. And you can claim your four or five dollars
[350.87s -> 353.66s]  from the lawsuit.
[353.66s -> 356.86s]  I'm just sitting there being like, you're gonna send me a check for like five bucks?
[360.49s -> 361.61s]  What?
[361.61s -> 365.05s]  Why don't, why don't we just have these guys like rebuild a bunch of schools?
[366.01s -> 371.40s]  Instead of sending everybody that was part of the class action lawsuit, like a few dollars in a check.
[372.12s -> 377.32s]  Just like fucking take like the 400 million dollars and like redo a whole city block.
[377.96s -> 381.22s]  I don't want the six dollars.
[386.49s -> 391.05s]  We should be able to vote on what happens to that money. I don't want the five dollars.
[391.13s -> 393.45s]  I want you to, I want you to redo a school.
[400.33s -> 402.33s]  Lawyer Jerma Sanders.
[403.53s -> 405.77s]  That's not, that's not that. No, it's not.
[411.37s -> 413.37s]  That's communist garbage.
[413.37s -> 418.41s]  It's not, no, it all, look, it already is doing that. They're giving all of us five dollars.
[418.97s -> 423.37s]  I'm just saying utilize that money in a better way. Instead of giving everybody five bucks,
[423.69s -> 427.69s]  let's redo the fucking like a city in, in a state and just pick one.
[432.71s -> 435.35s]  How do you even, would you, you cash a check for five dollars?
[441.99s -> 446.47s]  I'm going to go in there and be like, ah, yeah, here's, here's my check that I got for three dollars and 12 cents.
[446.79s -> 448.79s]  Uh, I'd like that in ones, please.
[451.38s -> 453.38s]  I'd like that, I'd like that in coins.
[453.86s -> 459.67s]  I'd like that in pennies.
[459.67s -> 463.19s]  And the person behind the counter is like, oh, you want that in ones? Oh shit.
[464.31s -> 465.75s]  Okay.
[465.75s -> 467.19s]  One,
[467.19s -> 468.55s]  two,
[468.55s -> 470.55s]  three. Oh, my fingers are
[470.63s -> 472.63s]  ow, kind of getting tight.
[476.65s -> 480.97s]  I almost want to like, I almost want to like mail it back and just write like fuck you on the back.
[484.26s -> 486.26s]  Right, fuck you, redo a school.
[486.58s -> 498.87s]  I'm waiting for, get on with it. All right. Yeah, I'm just telling you like we're talking, we're talking here.
[499.43s -> 501.19s]  That's lawful evil.
[501.19s -> 503.82s]  That's not.
[503.82s -> 508.46s]  Lawful evil would be I would try to find a way to get everybody else's check legally.
[509.40s -> 521.42s]  That's lawful evil.
[521.42s -> 523.32s]  Neutral evil.
[523.32s -> 526.04s]  Chaotic based hypers. All right, let's go.
[527.90s -> 533.61s]  Long story short, when a class session lawsuit pays out like four dollars a person, no, just like,
[534.66s -> 539.54s]  I'd rather you make like a game show and invite on like 25 people that were part of this lawsuit.
[539.94s -> 549.99s]  And make it like a 10 million dollar game show and put it on tv. Start the game, I'm about to.
[556.82s -> 559.85s]  Cole's lawsuit. All right, does this game suck?
[560.41s -> 569.13s]  Anybody know? It's based cringe. I don't know that that's an oxymoron. That doesn't make any sense.
[571.34s -> 573.26s]  Yeah, it's good. All right. This is called bugs.
[573.98s -> 576.12s]  That was a lot of, you hear that like,
[576.12s -> 588.95s]  uh, it's bug snacks. Ready? I'm ready. It's such a good game. It sucks, but it's cute.
[589.27s -> 594.97s]  I feel like a lot of you say that about me. So should be all right.
[595.69s -> 604.20s]  Okay, this is us. Is our map.
[609.85s -> 613.82s]  What?
[613.90s -> 616.31s]  Snacks.
[616.31s -> 617.27s]  Move.
[617.27s -> 619.43s]  The sir. Oh, that's that's gotta come down.
[620.42s -> 622.98s]  That's gotta come down. That's way too crazy.
[625.05s -> 630.90s]  30.
[630.90s -> 632.42s]  Uh, even more.
[632.42s -> 636.02s]  This is made in dreams.
[636.02s -> 639.48s]  It'd be kind of cool if it was actually.
[639.48s -> 644.89s]  All right, let's go with uh, 18. 18 feels all right.
[645.45s -> 646.89s]  Keep a little lower.
[646.89s -> 656.49s]  Still too high. 14. That's good. All right, here we go.
[657.37s -> 658.73s]  Get a raid.
[658.73s -> 659.77s]  We raided.
[659.77s -> 662.63s]  What's up?
[662.63s -> 668.31s]  Raid from...
[668.31s -> 670.71s]  Slime. It actually is a slime raid.
[671.86s -> 672.82s]  Slime sickle.
[674.41s -> 677.37s]  Slime sickle just raided the real slime.
[678.01s -> 680.06s]  This is a real slime raid.
[683.37s -> 685.67s]  Oh, spider.
[688.04s -> 689.08s]  Let's pick that up.
[689.08s -> 692.12s]  But thanks. Welcome everybody. We just, we literally just, I just turned the stream on.
[692.12s -> 693.88s]  So welcome. You do. You're in for a treat.
[693.88s -> 695.32s]  Thank you. Slime sickle.
[695.32s -> 700.63s]  Hope you had a good stream.
[700.63s -> 702.23s]  When are you going to be a slime tuber?
[703.37s -> 708.26s]  I don't know.
[708.26s -> 709.22s]  Okay.
[709.22s -> 713.51s]  I feel like I'm overusing that. Am I overusing like the monkey ass? I feel like I am.
[716.22s -> 718.14s]  I, I am. I feel like I am.
[719.16s -> 721.72s]  That's a crutch. That's like a comedy crutch and I'm not going to use it anymore.
[725.14s -> 727.70s]  Thought I was going to fall. First fall joke of the evening. Not going to get it here.
[733.82s -> 735.82s]  This game is, I don't even know.
[735.98s -> 738.14s]  I was going to say good, but I don't, I haven't played it yet.
[739.10s -> 743.94s]  That was a pizza.
[743.94s -> 745.94s]  That was a flying pizza.
[745.94s -> 751.77s]  Is it supposed to do something?
[751.77s -> 755.21s]  Two weeks earlier.
[755.21s -> 759.62s]  It's voice acted.
[765.50s -> 767.50s]  That's what happens when you mix a walrus and a dachshund.
[768.14s -> 785.93s]  These are Muffet characters.
[785.93s -> 787.61s]  Snack tooth island.
[787.61s -> 793.88s]  Oh, how many followers do you have?
[795.19s -> 797.19s]  I don't even get out of bed for anything less than a thousand.
[797.75s -> 807.59s]  That was rude.
[807.59s -> 811.10s]  Was it? Yeah.
[811.10s -> 813.58s]  That was wicked rude. You're right. Yeah, that was incredibly rude.
[817.77s -> 823.53s]  Half bug, half snacks.
[823.53s -> 824.41s]  No!
[824.41s -> 832.71s]  He missed!
[832.71s -> 833.67s]  Peace.
[833.67s -> 838.50s]  Boiling grump.
[838.50s -> 848.92s]  Are those weapons around the belt?
[848.92s -> 851.72s]  Soy.
[851.72s -> 853.72s]  Soy. Yeah, of course.
[855.35s -> 861.32s]  The three-letter word that creates immediate hilarious reaction.
[866.76s -> 869.45s]  Press on somebody to talk.
[869.45s -> 871.45s]  Oh, how about you? How about Clumby Clumbernut?
[871.45s -> 878.62s]  That's Justin Roiland name for a character if I've ever seen one.
[884.63s -> 886.94s]  I thought that was a cross around her neck.
[886.94s -> 888.94s]  I was like, oh shit.
[896.02s -> 898.02s]  Diplomacy only.
[902.02s -> 904.02s]  Reader repulsa.
[904.02s -> 906.02s]  You're already at a second chances.
[906.02s -> 908.46s]  Kinda sounds like her, yeah.
[913.18s -> 915.18s]  After 10,000 years, I'm free.
[915.18s -> 917.78s]  Remember that horse with grumplantis?
[917.78s -> 921.78s]  It's time to conquer Earth.
[921.78s -> 924.09s]  You know the best part about that song,
[924.09s -> 926.09s]  not that song, that intro,
[926.09s -> 930.09s]  was it pumped you up because that's when the big buildup started to happen.
[930.09s -> 932.09s]  That like...
[934.09s -> 936.09s]  I got so hyped up when I was a kid.
[936.09s -> 938.09s]  When she got out and she starts talking
[938.09s -> 940.09s]  and that fucking riff starts playing.
[940.09s -> 942.09s]  Oh, man. Nothing could wake you up on a Saturday morning
[942.09s -> 944.09s]  more than that riff.
[944.09s -> 950.68s]  You guys know the Simon from American Idol made that song up?
[950.68s -> 954.12s]  That's his legacy.
[954.12s -> 956.49s]  He wrote that song.
[956.49s -> 958.49s]  Yes, it's true.
[958.49s -> 960.49s]  Simon from fucking American Idol.
[960.49s -> 962.49s]  Simon, yeah, you look terrible.
[962.49s -> 964.66s]  That guy. He like made that song.
[964.66s -> 967.80s]  Go look it up, I swear to God.
[967.80s -> 969.80s]  Why don't you believe... I'm going.
[969.80s -> 971.80s]  Simon Cowell. Yes, he did.
[971.80s -> 975.90s]  Yes, he did.
[975.90s -> 977.90s]  Go, go Power Rangers.
[977.90s -> 979.90s]  Simon Cowell had a ton to do with it.
[986.26s -> 988.26s]  You know, nobody did the research.
[990.26s -> 992.26s]  Imagine auditioning for American Idol
[992.26s -> 994.26s]  and you do go, go Power Rangers
[994.26s -> 996.26s]  while just staring at Simon Cowell.
[996.26s -> 998.26s]  Like, you know you're going to lose.
[998.26s -> 1000.26s]  You're going to be one of the joke contestants.
[1000.26s -> 1004.04s]  Not many people will get it, but you'll get it.
[1004.04s -> 1006.04s]  You'll be like, go, go Power Rangers
[1006.04s -> 1008.04s]  while staring right at Simon.
[1008.04s -> 1010.92s]  And then like when it's all done, you're like,
[1010.92s -> 1012.92s]  oh, I love that song. I really wish I could
[1012.92s -> 1014.92s]  give gratitude to the person that had like
[1014.92s -> 1017.54s]  produced it and created it.
[1017.54s -> 1019.54s]  And he would just be embarrassed and pretend like, snack!
[1019.54s -> 1031.26s]  DOV. Outer Wilds.
[1031.26s -> 1035.61s]  Yeah, we missed a ton of information.
[1035.61s -> 1038.92s]  But it's okay.
[1038.92s -> 1040.92s]  I feel like the FO... Is the FOV too small?
[1040.92s -> 1044.38s]  What is it at 90 right now? 90?
[1044.38s -> 1049.11s]  It's at 90. What about 95?
[1049.11s -> 1059.22s]  Did that even change? It's not doing anything.
[1059.22s -> 1071.43s]  Uh, there's no FOV difference.
[1071.43s -> 1074.76s]  That's weird. Is it broken?
[1074.76s -> 1076.76s]  I feel like it's not 90. This doesn't look like
[1076.76s -> 1078.94s]  90, does it? Doesn't look like 90 to me.
[1078.94s -> 1081.75s]  Do we have to restart the game?
[1081.75s -> 1084.55s]  Turn the game up. You got it.
[1084.55s -> 1088.84s]  I say you got it.
[1090.84s -> 1093.46s]  No.
[1093.46s -> 1095.46s]  Oh, this is way too fucking loud.
[1095.46s -> 1097.46s]  Let's stop listening to you guys.
[1097.46s -> 1101.37s]  Alright, who are you?
[1101.37s -> 1103.67s]  What are you doing here?
[1103.67s -> 1106.62s]  What happened?
[1114.62s -> 1116.98s]  Okay, where's Lizbert?
[1116.98s -> 1118.98s]  Mercy killed this guy?
[1118.98s -> 1124.54s]  You're gonna have to put him down.
[1129.10s -> 1131.10s]  Well, looks like you're not gonna make it, Filbert.
[1131.10s -> 1133.10s]  Ah, see you later.
[1133.10s -> 1135.46s]  See you in hell. Okay.
[1135.46s -> 1141.22s]  There's a bug snack right over there.
[1141.22s -> 1143.22s]  Did you get a good look at it?
[1143.22s -> 1145.78s]  There's a snack over here.
[1145.78s -> 1147.78s]  Scan the bug snack. Alright, new assignment started.
[1147.78s -> 1149.78s]  Press F to open the snack scope.
[1149.78s -> 1151.78s]  Oh, cool.
[1151.78s -> 1153.96s]  Strabby, a very simple snack.
[1153.96s -> 1155.96s]  Watch its walking pattern.
[1155.96s -> 1158.78s]  They're a little shy, but that's okay.
[1158.78s -> 1161.40s]  They just need some space.
[1161.40s -> 1163.40s]  Loves, um, coconuts or something.
[1163.40s -> 1165.40s]  Okay.
[1165.40s -> 1167.64s]  Report to Filbo.
[1167.64s -> 1169.64s]  I scanned it.
[1169.64s -> 1171.64s]  That one's pretty easy to catch.
[1171.64s -> 1174.46s]  Well, me anyway.
[1174.46s -> 1178.46s]  Simon Cowell had nothing to do with Power Rangers, you goon.
[1178.46s -> 1180.76s]  What?
[1180.76s -> 1183.83s]  Yes, he did. Yes, he did.
[1183.83s -> 1185.83s]  He, like, produced it.
[1185.83s -> 1188.26s]  Its tracks come out of this bush.
[1188.26s -> 1190.82s]  The snack trap down there.
[1190.82s -> 1193.45s]  He bought the rights.
[1193.45s -> 1195.45s]  Yes, he did. He had something to do with it.
[1195.45s -> 1197.45s]  He actually did.
[1197.45s -> 1199.45s]  Okay, you don't have your snack trap selected.
[1199.45s -> 1201.45s]  Hold Q to open the wheel. Snack trap.
[1201.45s -> 1203.75s]  Deploy snack trap.
[1203.75s -> 1205.75s]  Catch the bug snack.
[1205.75s -> 1208.25s]  Alright, deployed.
[1208.25s -> 1210.74s]  Oh, I scared him. Get out here and get eaten.
[1210.74s -> 1232.23s]  Filbo, what are we doing wrong?
[1232.23s -> 1234.23s]  Alright, put that down and hide.
[1234.23s -> 1240.57s]  Where is he?
[1240.57s -> 1243.26s]  Oh shit, I gotta get it before he gets out.
[1243.26s -> 1246.65s]  I got a Strabby.
[1246.65s -> 1251.90s]  I'm gonna do all these.
[1251.90s -> 1253.90s]  You know I'm gonna do all these voices.
[1253.90s -> 1255.90s]  I'm gonna do them. You know I am.
[1255.90s -> 1257.90s]  I can't help it.
[1257.90s -> 1259.90s]  It made noise. I have to.
[1259.90s -> 1261.90s]  Here, have a...
[1261.90s -> 1263.90s]  Wait, let me talk to you first.
[1268.44s -> 1272.34s]  I kinda wanna just push you in the river now.
[1272.34s -> 1278.34s]  What the fuck?
[1278.34s -> 1282.17s]  Don't eat those.
[1288.58s -> 1290.58s]  Poison.
[1292.58s -> 1294.58s]  Alright.
[1294.58s -> 1296.58s]  But I wanna do it
[1296.58s -> 1298.58s]  as if you were birds.
[1298.58s -> 1300.58s]  You're my baby bird. I'm gonna chew it up
[1300.58s -> 1302.58s]  and I'm gonna spit it into your mouth.
[1302.58s -> 1304.58s]  Are you into that? You okay with that?
[1304.58s -> 1306.58s]  You don't have your snack trap selected.
[1306.58s -> 1310.42s]  Alright, we need to get three bug snacks.
[1310.42s -> 1314.33s]  You're a monster.
[1314.33s -> 1317.21s]  Okay, let's get three bug snacks.
[1317.21s -> 1321.05s]  There's definitely gonna be some in here.
[1321.05s -> 1323.05s]  You see any strawberries? Alright, I see a peach snake.
[1323.05s -> 1327.66s]  What is that?
[1327.66s -> 1336.34s]  Alright, now go in there.
[1336.34s -> 1342.36s]  Got it. It's a Ruto.
[1342.36s -> 1345.05s]  Scan it. Oh shit.
[1345.05s -> 1347.05s]  Alright, now we have to get another...
[1347.05s -> 1357.61s]  Two more.
[1357.61s -> 1359.61s]  Didn't scan. You soft-locked it.
[1359.61s -> 1361.61s]  There's no such thing as a soft-lock
[1361.61s -> 1364.74s]  in a bug snack game.
[1364.74s -> 1366.74s]  Oh, up there. Scan it.
[1366.74s -> 1370.52s]  It's a green lollipop
[1370.52s -> 1372.52s]  that latches onto snacks and traps
[1372.52s -> 1374.52s]  with its unsettling long tongue.
[1374.52s -> 1380.60s]  Alright, how do I get that? Is there a way I can get that?
[1380.60s -> 1386.68s]  I need two more.
[1386.68s -> 1392.18s]  How do I get them?
[1392.18s -> 1394.18s]  I need a tool I don't have. Oh, alright, cool.
[1394.18s -> 1398.39s]  I'm into it.
[1398.39s -> 1400.39s]  Wait, there's another one. Alright, hold on.
[1400.39s -> 1402.82s]  I can scan it. Scan this carrot now.
[1402.82s -> 1404.82s]  It's a carrot. Burrows into the soil
[1404.82s -> 1408.54s]  when it's scared. Alright.
[1408.54s -> 1411.61s]  Put this down. Put this in your
[1411.61s -> 1413.61s]  field of view right there.
[1413.61s -> 1419.86s]  And hide. What?
[1419.86s -> 1422.23s]  What are you doing? Give me that back.
[1422.23s -> 1427.03s]  How do I get that?
[1427.03s -> 1429.03s]  Give me this back. Why did you do that?
[1429.03s -> 1431.03s]  What? What does it say?
[1431.03s -> 1433.85s]  Press E to get it back?
[1433.85s -> 1437.75s]  E, retrieve. E.
[1437.75s -> 1442.60s]  E. You're lucky I don't have
[1442.60s -> 1444.60s]  a fucking gun. Alright.
[1444.60s -> 1455.21s]  Get out of here.
[1455.21s -> 1457.58s]  Got two Roodles. Let's get one more.
[1457.58s -> 1460.46s]  Does this guy like Roodles?
[1460.46s -> 1464.68s]  What kind of food does this guy like?
[1464.68s -> 1468.50s]  You see anything? I don't see anything.
[1468.50s -> 1470.87s]  Oh, he hates them. Well, I'm sorry.
[1470.87s -> 1472.87s]  Beggars can't be choosers. If you tell me,
[1472.87s -> 1474.87s]  go get me food, but tell me what you don't want.
[1474.87s -> 1476.87s]  You don't give me the specifics, like your dietary
[1476.87s -> 1480.07s]  restrictions. Like if you say,
[1480.07s -> 1482.07s]  hey, go pick up a bunch of food for me. Alright, man.
[1482.07s -> 1484.07s]  You into, like,
[1484.07s -> 1486.31s]  you into peanuts?
[1486.31s -> 1489.62s]  Yeah, sure. Wait, no.
[1489.62s -> 1491.62s]  Let me redo that. Reset.
[1491.62s -> 1493.62s]  Three, two, one.
[1493.62s -> 1495.62s]  It's like if you got, like, hold on. Reset that again.
[1495.62s -> 1497.62s]  In three,
[1497.62s -> 1499.62s]  two, one. Okay.
[1499.62s -> 1501.62s]  So, like, if you were to order food for somebody,
[1501.62s -> 1503.62s]  and they said, get whatever, I don't care,
[1503.62s -> 1505.62s]  and then you come back with, like, a bag of peanuts, and they go,
[1505.62s -> 1507.62s]  dude, I'm allergic to peanuts. What the fuck's wrong with you?
[1507.62s -> 1509.62s]  It's like, dude, you should have told me what you were allergic to
[1509.62s -> 1511.99s]  before I went and got food.
[1511.99s -> 1513.99s]  Sign it. Ship that. Close it.
[1513.99s -> 1516.94s]  Cut point right there.
[1516.94s -> 1528.46s]  Thank you. Where's the joke? No, it wasn't a joke.
[1528.46s -> 1530.46s]  It was just, like, a cool reference to, like, cut to.
[1530.46s -> 1533.66s]  Alright.
[1533.66s -> 1535.66s]  I'm gonna feed this guy.
[1535.66s -> 1541.08s]  Mmm, carrots.
[1541.08s -> 1543.08s]  Oh, he's gonna have carrot legs.
[1543.08s -> 1546.02s]  That's a family guy.
[1546.02s -> 1548.02s]  No, it's not a family guy.
[1548.02s -> 1555.45s]  Why would that be awesome?
[1555.45s -> 1557.45s]  That would be terrible. That would suck.
[1557.45s -> 1559.45s]  Alright, well, is there any more rootles or strudels?
[1559.45s -> 1563.10s]  Ah!
[1563.10s -> 1565.90s]  Alright, that's the path.
[1565.90s -> 1567.90s]  Go ahead. Alright, place that. Hide.
[1567.90s -> 1573.83s]  Come on out.
[1573.83s -> 1579.78s]  Alright, let's move.
[1579.78s -> 1582.79s]  Is he gonna have a strawberry leg? He is.
[1582.79s -> 1588.87s]  Why'd I get that close?
[1593.11s -> 1595.11s]  Isn't one of the gremlins in Gremlins 2 like this?
[1597.11s -> 1599.48s]  The vegetable gremlin?
[1606.73s -> 1608.73s]  Oh, I'm here to investigate the bug snack.
[1610.73s -> 1613.03s]  Stop playing this fetish game.
[1615.72s -> 1617.72s]  Get out of here.
[1627.72s -> 1631.62s]  Alright.
[1631.62s -> 1633.62s]  Let's put this away.
[1633.62s -> 1636.70s]  You're running pretty damn fast, dude.
[1636.70s -> 1639.83s]  Alright, what's the right hook button?
[1648.87s -> 1651.94s]  Why not?
[1656.54s -> 1658.54s]  Who knows?
[1658.54s -> 1660.54s]  Maybe she will be there when we get back.
[1660.54s -> 1662.54s]  Is this the actual mayor?
[1664.54s -> 1666.54s]  Or is this a terrible
[1666.54s -> 1668.54s]  Halloween costume?
[1668.54s -> 1670.54s]  Like you're the mayor of Flavortown
[1670.54s -> 1672.54s]  and you're just in a white t-shirt and shit.
[1672.54s -> 1674.54s]  But you get to make the Guy Fieri joke
[1674.54s -> 1676.54s]  every night and people laugh at it
[1676.54s -> 1678.54s]  because they're like, oh, that's funny.
[1678.54s -> 1680.54s]  Okay, I get it, right?
[1680.54s -> 1682.71s]  Alright, through here.
[1682.71s -> 1690.71s]  Yeah.
[1690.71s -> 1696.15s]  Hahaha.
[1696.15s -> 1698.15s]  Why are you playing terrible games two days in a row?
[1698.15s -> 1700.15s]  This is, um, excuse me.
[1700.15s -> 1702.15s]  People love this game.
[1702.15s -> 1704.15s]  This is like a really popular game that people love.
[1704.15s -> 1706.15s]  Look, I accepted
[1706.15s -> 1708.15s]  yesterday, but not today.
[1711.91s -> 1716.20s]  Is that Chris Metzen?
[1730.86s -> 1732.86s]  It is. That's Chris Metzen.
[1736.86s -> 1739.16s]  That's Chris Metzen.
[1739.16s -> 1741.16s]  He's like, he gave his voice to the game.
[1741.16s -> 1743.16s]  He's a blizzard.
[1749.16s -> 1751.16s]  He clearly says
[1751.16s -> 1753.16s]  Wumfest.
[1759.18s -> 1761.18s]  That was weird.
[1761.18s -> 1763.18s]  Ketchup?
[1764.18s -> 1766.18s]  There's a hamburger bug.
[1766.18s -> 1772.83s]  Wait, there's hamburger bugs.
[1782.83s -> 1788.45s]  Bunger.
[1788.45s -> 1790.45s]  Alright, press on a nearby sauce farm.
[1790.45s -> 1792.82s]  Alright, let's get some sauce.
[1792.82s -> 1795.38s]  Ketchup.
[1795.38s -> 1797.38s]  Alright, fill it up. I have, how much ketchup do I need?
[1797.38s -> 1799.38s]  Might as well fill the whole thing.
[1799.38s -> 1801.55s]  Alright, now lower the
[1801.55s -> 1803.55s]  Bunger into the pen.
[1803.55s -> 1809.44s]  Come on over here, Bunger.
[1809.44s -> 1819.28s]  Bunger! Get in there.
[1819.28s -> 1823.95s]  We get to split this, right?
[1823.95s -> 1825.95s]  Bunger, Bunger, Bunger, Bunger.
[1825.95s -> 1827.95s]  Bunger, Bunger, Bunger, Bunger.
[1827.95s -> 1836.85s]  I love this cheeseburger guy.
[1836.85s -> 1840.24s]  Alright.
[1840.24s -> 1843.31s]  Alright, check on Philbo.
[1843.31s -> 1846.70s]  Like fell down here, right?
[1846.70s -> 1850.61s]  They're like Pokemon.
[1850.61s -> 1852.61s]  Can they fall down here? Where is he?
[1852.61s -> 1856.83s]  Wait, scan that thing. Yeah, scan these.
[1856.83s -> 1858.83s]  Alright, it's a french fry bug.
[1858.83s -> 1861.33s]  Climbs onto high walls out of reach, but will come down
[1861.33s -> 1863.33s]  if it smells ketchup.
[1863.33s -> 1887.95s]  Hold on, let me do this right.
[1887.95s -> 1894.02s]  Got a fryer.
[1894.02s -> 1896.70s]  Alright, what about this thing? Something in here.
[1896.70s -> 1903.55s]  Wait, what was this one? Scan it first
[1903.55s -> 1907.20s]  before I catch it. It was a bush.
[1907.20s -> 1912.43s]  Alright, get out.
[1912.43s -> 1915.70s]  Tasty enemy fryer.
[1915.70s -> 1919.47s]  Alright, there's a burger snack.
[1919.47s -> 1921.47s]  Knocks away traps. It also tackles anything
[1921.47s -> 1923.47s]  covered in ketchup. Wait a minute.
[1923.47s -> 1928.27s]  Does it now? Does it now?
[1928.27s -> 1932.24s]  Come tackle this and
[1932.24s -> 1935.50s]  break this guy out of here.
[1935.50s -> 1938.56s]  Bunger. Hey.
[1938.56s -> 1944.38s]  Get over here. Check that out.
[1944.38s -> 1950.34s]  What's that? No!
[1950.34s -> 1961.34s]  We went the wrong way. I can't catch him?
[1961.34s -> 1967.15s]  Wait, give me this back.
[1967.15s -> 1969.71s]  Alright, cover that in ketchup.
[1969.71s -> 1971.71s]  Oh my fucking god, you idiot.
[1971.71s -> 1973.71s]  Alright, hold on. I'm gonna get this.
[1973.71s -> 1980.99s]  Alright, Bunger, this way.
[1980.99s -> 1985.71s]  Bunger, look.
[1985.71s -> 1988.08s]  Check that out. No, no, no, no.
[1988.08s -> 1991.73s]  Wrong way. Come back here.
[1991.73s -> 1993.73s]  This game is fucking dope.
[1993.73s -> 2005.87s]  Get back here.
[2005.87s -> 2008.30s]  Yes, yes.
[2008.30s -> 2011.36s]  Now go crash into that.
[2011.36s -> 2016.86s]  Here we go.
[2016.86s -> 2018.86s]  Oh, snipe.
[2018.86s -> 2023.54s]  I didn't scan him. Oops.
[2023.54s -> 2025.54s]  Shishkebug. Wait, there's a shishkebug over here.
[2025.54s -> 2027.84s]  Once this pest hides,
[2027.84s -> 2029.84s]  it won't come out of hiding until it's forced.
[2029.84s -> 2032.08s]  Yep, alright, cool.
[2032.08s -> 2034.08s]  Let's get this guy again.
[2034.08s -> 2037.60s]  Wait, he's pretty stupid. He might just walk into it.
[2037.60s -> 2044.18s]  Oh, stupid.
[2044.18s -> 2052.24s]  Break him out. Why can't I pick up
[2052.24s -> 2058.06s]  the burger bugs?
[2058.06s -> 2060.24s]  You're a stupid. Why am I stupid?
[2060.24s -> 2062.61s]  Alright, where's Philbo?
[2062.61s -> 2064.61s]  He fell off this bridge.
[2064.61s -> 2066.78s]  Hey. Oh, very nice.
[2066.78s -> 2069.92s]  Wait, there he is.
[2069.92s -> 2074.38s]  Do you want some food?
[2080.82s -> 2082.82s]  Need a different trap. Okay.
[2090.82s -> 2092.82s]  Okay.
[2107.30s -> 2109.30s]  I already got two of them.
[2109.30s -> 2111.30s]  You want some?
[2117.30s -> 2119.30s]  Got it already.
[2121.30s -> 2123.30s]  Oh man, your food has already arrived.
[2123.30s -> 2126.69s]  Your food already arrived.
[2129.44s -> 2134.10s]  I gave him a weapon.
[2140.75s -> 2142.75s]  I got those too.
[2151.50s -> 2154.69s]  Oh, he wants two of these?
[2154.69s -> 2157.57s]  Are these tomatoes?
[2157.57s -> 2159.57s]  They have tomato, garlic, butts, and beef bums?
[2159.57s -> 2161.57s]  Beef? I don't know.
[2161.57s -> 2163.57s]  They look like they're garlic and beef and mushrooms and bums.
[2172.59s -> 2174.59s]  How do I get them?
[2180.59s -> 2182.59s]  Okay. You got the bug net.
[2182.59s -> 2184.59s]  Now you can pick up bug snacks when they're stunned.
[2184.59s -> 2189.18s]  Really?
[2189.18s -> 2191.94s]  Oh, shit. Let me go.
[2191.94s -> 2194.37s]  Catch this thing with the net.
[2194.37s -> 2197.89s]  Where's the net?
[2197.89s -> 2199.89s]  Oh, you don't have to even equip it.
[2199.89s -> 2202.19s]  Alright, so how do I stun you?
[2202.19s -> 2205.07s]  How do you get stunned?
[2205.07s -> 2208.66s]  Get out of here.
[2208.66s -> 2210.66s]  What else? I had to set him up scarecrows
[2210.66s -> 2213.34s]  to give him something else to tackle.
[2213.34s -> 2216.48s]  Now look at this net that you just found.
[2216.48s -> 2220.13s]  Oh, alright.
[2220.13s -> 2222.13s]  Look at this net that I just found.
[2222.13s -> 2226.35s]  Okay, I get it.
[2226.35s -> 2228.59s]  Hey, how do I catch him?
[2228.59s -> 2233.58s]  Not on me!
[2233.58s -> 2236.02s]  Idiots!
[2238.02s -> 2243.71s]  Have you ever tried to catch
[2243.71s -> 2245.71s]  a real life superhero?
[2245.71s -> 2248.34s]  Have you ever used a disguise?
[2248.34s -> 2250.51s]  How do I catch this?
[2250.51s -> 2260.80s]  He didn't tell me how to like stun him.
[2260.80s -> 2264.83s]  I just rammed him to him.
[2264.83s -> 2267.58s]  Did I not put his head?
[2267.58s -> 2273.33s]  Hit him.
[2273.33s -> 2275.76s]  Wait, it rammed into like a pole.
[2275.76s -> 2278.51s]  Oh, that didn't work.
[2278.51s -> 2283.12s]  Alright, Bunger.
[2283.12s -> 2286.90s]  Into the wall. It didn't work.
[2286.90s -> 2290.42s]  Ram another Bunger.
[2290.42s -> 2292.59s]  Bunger versus Bunger.
[2292.59s -> 2296.82s]  Bunger.
[2296.82s -> 2299.44s]  Sounds like a shitty law firm.
[2299.44s -> 2302.00s]  Had Bunger and Bunger.
[2302.00s -> 2305.26s]  We take your case dead serious.
[2305.26s -> 2308.98s]  Alright, hit him.
[2308.98s -> 2315.25s]  Come over here. PvP time.
[2315.25s -> 2324.13s]  Go get that. Bunger.
[2324.13s -> 2329.36s]  Bunger! Bunger!
[2329.36s -> 2335.38s]  I don't think this is going to work.
[2335.38s -> 2338.32s]  Over there. Into a tree.
[2338.32s -> 2342.98s]  Smash into that tree.
[2342.98s -> 2346.18s]  Alright, Bunger.
[2346.18s -> 2350.51s]  Bunger? Okay.
[2350.51s -> 2362.46s]  Bunger! No!
[2362.46s -> 2372.43s]  Out of Bunger.
[2372.43s -> 2374.43s]  Here you go. I got it just for you, man.
[2374.43s -> 2380.64s]  What? You should get a hamburger head.
[2380.64s -> 2382.64s]  Justice is served.
[2382.64s -> 2385.78s]  How come when they get
[2385.78s -> 2387.78s]  bit down on, they don't go like...
[2387.78s -> 2389.78s]  Oh!
[2389.78s -> 2391.78s]  Well like...
[2391.78s -> 2393.78s]  More realistic that way.
[2393.78s -> 2397.42s]  Let's get moving right away.
[2397.42s -> 2400.62s]  You're a pretty good hunter.
[2400.62s -> 2402.62s]  Like Philbo said.
[2402.62s -> 2404.62s]  This is a kid's game.
[2404.62s -> 2406.62s]  Yeah, but I mean...
[2406.62s -> 2410.91s]  Is it?
[2410.91s -> 2412.91s]  It is.
[2412.91s -> 2415.73s]  Well, it's an E for everyone.
[2415.73s -> 2417.73s]  Is Mario a kid's game?
[2417.73s -> 2419.73s]  I disagree. I played those cube
[2419.73s -> 2421.73s]  levels in Mario Sunshine. I disagree.
[2421.73s -> 2432.22s]  Wait.
[2432.22s -> 2434.22s]  Will he get Bungered in the face?
[2434.22s -> 2438.38s]  Okay, follow Philbo
[2438.38s -> 2441.20s]  to Snackburg.
[2445.44s -> 2447.44s]  What's a squeeve?
[2451.44s -> 2453.44s]  Gold camera.
[2453.44s -> 2455.81s]  That thing's worth a lot of money.
[2461.81s -> 2465.12s]  Is it like a dweeb? Like you're a dweeb.
[2473.25s -> 2475.25s]  That's my friend you're talking about.
[2475.25s -> 2477.81s]  Don't worry. We'll get our revenge.
[2477.81s -> 2479.81s]  Slow and meticulous.
[2479.81s -> 2485.06s]  What do you know?
[2485.06s -> 2487.30s]  Here. Eat this. No!
[2487.30s -> 2489.66s]  You don't get any. I'm not giving you any food.
[2491.66s -> 2493.66s]  I haven't seen a new face in like forever.
[2493.66s -> 2495.66s]  I'm Bethica Winkle Snoot.
[2495.66s -> 2497.66s]  And I know everything about everybody.
[2497.66s -> 2499.66s]  It's pretty cool toupee hair.
[2499.66s -> 2502.29s]  Uncombed toupee.
[2502.29s -> 2504.29s]  Alright, can I help you?
[2504.29s -> 2506.29s]  I love your snack scope.
[2506.29s -> 2508.29s]  You and me are totes twinsies.
[2508.29s -> 2510.29s]  I bet you've seen lots of great stuff.
[2510.29s -> 2512.29s]  Let me take a peek at your journal.
[2512.29s -> 2515.36s]  No, it's mine.
[2515.36s -> 2517.36s]  You lost your journal?
[2517.36s -> 2519.36s]  No big deal. You can borrow
[2519.36s -> 2521.36s]  one of mine. I keep them in my
[2521.36s -> 2523.36s]  cave. Bring it here.
[2523.36s -> 2525.36s]  I'll show you how it's done.
[2525.36s -> 2528.05s]  Pick up the journal.
[2528.05s -> 2541.55s]  I got the journal.
[2541.55s -> 2543.55s]  Are we playing solitaire?
[2543.55s -> 2545.92s]  Wait. You're playing solitaire
[2545.92s -> 2547.92s]  by yourself in your house?
[2547.92s -> 2550.16s]  What filbert is the squeep?
[2550.16s -> 2555.66s]  Wait, you're gonna call somebody like a
[2555.66s -> 2557.66s]  squeeb and talk a bunch of shit and you're playing solitaire
[2557.66s -> 2560.35s]  on the ground in your house?
[2560.35s -> 2566.56s]  That's not okay.
[2566.56s -> 2572.19s]  Let's get a photo of this. She's projecting.
[2572.19s -> 2583.58s]  Hi, I've got the
[2583.58s -> 2585.58s]  diary and whatever it is.
[2585.58s -> 2590.38s]  You're a belly?
[2590.38s -> 2592.75s]  Oh, it tells you what you've caught so far.
[2592.75s -> 2594.75s]  This is cool. This is your Bugapedia.
[2594.75s -> 2596.75s]  You can scroll
[2596.75s -> 2598.75s]  through all the bug stacks you've scanned
[2598.75s -> 2600.75s]  with your snack scope.
[2600.75s -> 2602.75s]  You can also check on their likes, dislikes,
[2602.75s -> 2604.75s]  and hints on how to catch them.
[2604.75s -> 2607.57s]  Now check out the other pages to see what
[2607.57s -> 2610.06s]  they're all about. Loves
[2610.06s -> 2612.24s]  beating human hearts and
[2612.24s -> 2614.24s]  is afraid of bumper bug.
[2614.24s -> 2619.79s]  Ooh, what's this?
[2619.79s -> 2621.79s]  Loves apple juice.
[2621.79s -> 2623.79s]  Loves, that's like tequila.
[2623.79s -> 2625.97s]  Whatever that is. 4900
[2625.97s -> 2627.97s]  calories. Why are these so many calories?
[2627.97s -> 2630.27s]  30,000
[2630.27s -> 2634.50s]  calories? You'd be shitting
[2634.50s -> 2639.42s]  for days. 36,000
[2639.42s -> 2641.42s]  calories. The human body
[2641.42s -> 2643.42s]  doesn't even have like 2,000 calories.
[2643.42s -> 2646.11s]  You take in 2,000 calories
[2646.11s -> 2648.11s]  a day. That's like your total calorie count in your
[2648.11s -> 2652.08s]  body. What is this?
[2652.08s -> 2655.28s]  This is your grumpedia. It's like a
[2655.28s -> 2657.28s]  Bugapedia but for grumpises.
[2657.28s -> 2660.16s]  This blank space will fill up with your notes
[2660.16s -> 2662.16s]  once you get to know each grumpis better.
[2662.16s -> 2666.06s]  The self-appointed mayor, he seems to be
[2666.06s -> 2668.06s]  trying his best. Right, he loves
[2668.06s -> 2671.71s]  this person.
[2671.71s -> 2673.71s]  He hates you. Why do you hate her?
[2673.71s -> 2675.71s]  Who do you hate?
[2675.71s -> 2678.51s]  You hate everybody.
[2678.51s -> 2680.51s]  A sharp-tongued socialite snoop,
[2680.51s -> 2682.51s]  my bestie apparently, likes gossip,
[2682.51s -> 2684.51s]  photography, and breaking and entering.
[2688.03s -> 2690.03s]  Why do you hate him
[2690.03s -> 2692.85s]  so much? Have I met
[2692.85s -> 2694.85s]  this person? Oh, Lizbert. Okay.
[2694.85s -> 2698.43s]  This is your clues page. It's where you'll keep
[2698.43s -> 2700.43s]  all your progress in finding Lizbert. I don't give
[2700.43s -> 2702.43s]  a shit about that. I want to get interesting
[2702.43s -> 2705.44s]  bugs. There's clues here.
[2705.44s -> 2707.81s]  A report on Lizbert's
[2707.81s -> 2711.52s]  discovery of bug snacks.
[2711.52s -> 2714.08s]  What's this? This is your quest list.
[2714.08s -> 2716.08s]  You can get in-depth info on all
[2716.08s -> 2718.45s]  your ongoing quests. You can also
[2718.45s -> 2720.45s]  pin a quest to keep it visible while you're walking
[2720.45s -> 2722.45s]  around.
[2722.45s -> 2726.10s]  This is your snack pack. It's where you
[2726.10s -> 2728.27s]  keep the bug snacks you've caught.
[2728.27s -> 2732.05s]  This is your map of Snark-
[2732.05s -> 2734.05s]  Snarktooth. It's a map.
[2734.05s -> 2737.44s]  This is your list of
[2737.44s -> 2739.44s]  tools. Just a way to keep
[2739.44s -> 2741.44s]  track of all your snack-catching gear.
[2741.44s -> 2748.16s]  You thought it was gonna be another one.
[2748.16s -> 2751.30s]  Oh, alright. Now what?
[2751.30s -> 2754.94s]  Everything you scan with the
[2754.94s -> 2756.94s]  snack scope winds up in the journal.
[2756.94s -> 2758.94s]  I have more for you to do,
[2758.94s -> 2760.94s]  but Wambus is scaring all the snacks
[2760.94s -> 2762.94s]  away. You'll have to come back
[2762.94s -> 2764.94s]  later. Until then,
[2764.94s -> 2766.94s]  you should get Bilbo out of here.
[2766.94s -> 2771.79s]  Okay. Bilbo!
[2771.79s -> 2773.79s]  I'm ready to follow you.
[2773.79s -> 2775.79s]  Let's get this over with, buddy.
[2775.79s -> 2782.13s]  Ding! Crit sound.
[2782.13s -> 2795.68s]  Why was he bent over like that?
[2795.68s -> 2797.68s]  How come there was never a
[2797.68s -> 2799.68s]  slingshot added to TF2? Don't you feel like
[2799.68s -> 2801.68s]  that could be like a scout primary that they just
[2801.68s -> 2806.16s]  didn't capitalize on?
[2816.48s -> 2818.66s]  Not primary.
[2818.66s -> 2821.60s]  I think it could work.
[2824.03s -> 2826.03s]  That's the huntsman. No, no, no, no, different.
[2826.03s -> 2833.07s]  Different. Alright, so do
[2833.07s -> 2835.07s]  we live in Snackburg?
[2835.07s -> 2837.07s]  When do the side effects of eating those bug drugs
[2837.07s -> 2839.07s]  wear off? Cause he still has those
[2839.07s -> 2841.38s]  body parts. Does it ever wear off?
[2841.38s -> 2843.38s]  Or is that just who you are now?
[2862.85s -> 2864.85s]  Why don't I interview you?
[2873.02s -> 2877.76s]  This is where I say
[2877.76s -> 2879.76s]  here we go, we're recording.
[2879.76s -> 2881.76s]  I turn it off, and we just have a little conversation
[2881.76s -> 2883.76s]  and I say yeah, maybe I'll
[2883.76s -> 2888.50s]  use that somewhere.
[2888.50s -> 2890.50s]  Uh, hey, who are you?
[2898.48s -> 2900.48s]  Big quotes.
[2900.48s -> 2905.54s]  Deputy Mayor.
[2905.54s -> 2907.54s]  What else? Why did you come to Snack through the Island?
[2915.14s -> 2917.14s]  Simon Cowell? What?
[2917.14s -> 2919.14s]  Hey, how do you feel about bug
[2919.14s -> 2921.14s]  snacks?
[2921.14s -> 2923.14s]  Great. I mean, they taste good
[2923.14s -> 2925.14s]  and they make everybody happy
[2925.14s -> 2927.14s]  so what's not to love?
[2927.14s -> 2930.14s]  Until you come down.
[2930.14s -> 2937.62s]  What do you think about that?
[2937.62s -> 2939.62s]  Lizbert and me go way back. Lizbert was
[2939.62s -> 2941.62s]  is awesome.
[2941.62s -> 2943.62s]  She always knew what
[2943.62s -> 2945.92s]  to do and she brought out the best
[2945.92s -> 2947.92s]  in all of us.
[2947.92s -> 2949.92s]  Ooh, Mitch McConnell. Oh, what?
[2949.92s -> 2951.92s]  Why? Does that make any sense
[2951.92s -> 2956.14s]  right now? Okay.
[2956.14s -> 2958.14s]  So that's how you became mayor?
[2958.14s -> 2963.01s]  You're a deadly side effect.
[2965.50s -> 2967.50s]  His eyes are like all purple
[2967.50s -> 2972.05s]  and red.
[2982.96s -> 2988.98s]  Okay, why didn't it last long?
[2994.98s -> 2996.98s]  Isn't that how the dinosaurs died?
[3001.97s -> 3005.04s]  I think we're done.
[3014.99s -> 3016.99s]  I feel like that thing's gonna pop off and shoot me in the face.
[3035.92s -> 3037.92s]  Okay.
[3045.92s -> 3049.94s]  Okay.
[3057.94s -> 3061.18s]  Alright.
[3063.87s -> 3066.43s]  I just turned his leg into
[3066.43s -> 3069.31s]  a piece of meat.
[3069.31s -> 3071.31s]  This is just fucking terrible
[3071.31s -> 3073.31s]  experiments I'm doing to these people.
[3073.31s -> 3078.88s]  Okay, we're gonna find Grimble
[3078.88s -> 3080.88s]  or go back to Becca.
[3080.88s -> 3083.06s]  No, Becca sucks.
[3083.06s -> 3085.06s]  I want Grimble.
[3085.06s -> 3088.19s]  Let's remove one of those letters.
[3088.19s -> 3090.19s]  Big fan.
[3090.19s -> 3095.74s]  This is locked.
[3095.74s -> 3097.74s]  All this stuff is locked. How do I break into people's things?
[3097.74s -> 3103.70s]  Stop right there!
[3103.70s -> 3107.09s]  You violated the law!
[3107.09s -> 3117.52s]  I go to the beach?
[3117.52s -> 3119.52s]  That's not the beach.
[3119.52s -> 3127.18s]  Is it? You didn't say criminal scum.
[3127.18s -> 3129.18s]  Minus two. Yeah, I'm just trying to keep you on your toes.
[3129.18s -> 3132.00s]  Alright, is this Grimble?
[3143.70s -> 3145.70s]  You're not Grimble.
[3145.70s -> 3147.70s]  Who are you?
[3157.70s -> 3160.26s]  What's that dog
[3160.26s -> 3162.26s]  with the big teeth that does that?
[3162.26s -> 3167.31s]  Who is Eggabelle?
[3173.31s -> 3175.62s]  Bulldog, yes.
[3191.62s -> 3193.62s]  I understand the internal mechanism behind
[3193.62s -> 3195.62s]  the molecular dissemination of snack
[3195.62s -> 3197.62s]  particles.
[3197.62s -> 3200.82s]  This is the Snack-tivator.
[3200.82s -> 3202.82s]  Info-ification.
[3202.82s -> 3204.82s]  What?
[3204.82s -> 3206.82s]  Foot turns into
[3206.82s -> 3208.82s]  Strabby. Understand?
[3208.82s -> 3210.82s]  Why did you...
[3210.82s -> 3212.82s]  Look at these arms.
[3212.82s -> 3215.42s]  Don't say...
[3215.42s -> 3217.42s]  What am I supposed to do?
[3217.42s -> 3219.42s]  Left foot? What I can choose?
[3219.42s -> 3221.42s]  What kind of weird experiments to do?
[3221.42s -> 3224.88s]  I don't even know what that is.
[3229.25s -> 3231.25s]  I don't know what that is.
[3231.25s -> 3233.25s]  I just read things. I'm a reader.
[3233.25s -> 3236.19s]  Where did you go? Where did you just go?
[3238.62s -> 3242.06s]  Oh, this is chocolate.
[3242.06s -> 3248.27s]  You have more than one kind of sauce.
[3248.27s -> 3251.47s]  What's that thing? It's a longnose.
[3251.47s -> 3253.84s]  A quibble. It follows things that it
[3253.84s -> 3255.84s]  likes. And it nudges them with
[3255.84s -> 3258.72s]  its spoon.
[3258.72s -> 3261.73s]  Let's take it.
[3261.73s -> 3285.14s]  Got it.
[3285.14s -> 3287.44s]  You have more than one kind of sauce.
[3287.44s -> 3289.44s]  Select your sauce slinger and then
[3289.44s -> 3292.26s]  select the sauce you want.
[3292.26s -> 3295.95s]  Chocolate sauce.
[3295.95s -> 3297.95s]  What does that weird lady want me to do?
[3297.95s -> 3300.32s]  I'm going to do something.
[3300.32s -> 3302.32s]  Look at all these...
[3302.32s -> 3304.56s]  strawberries.
[3304.56s -> 3312.56s]  There's a lot of strawberries here.
[3312.56s -> 3316.02s]  Scan. I already scanned the strawberries.
[3316.02s -> 3318.02s]  There's a floating macarito.
[3318.02s -> 3326.45s]  Oh, shit. Catch it.
[3326.45s -> 3328.45s]  This is their nest. I'll get like ten here.
[3328.45s -> 3337.97s]  Oh, crab.
[3337.97s -> 3340.34s]  It's a crapple.
[3340.34s -> 3342.34s]  This curious snack likes to dig things out
[3342.34s -> 3344.34s]  of the sand and bring them to its lair.
[3344.34s -> 3347.22s]  Oh, it's an apple crab.
[3347.22s -> 3352.38s]  Okay, so
[3352.38s -> 3360.32s]  can I catch you with this?
[3360.32s -> 3362.32s]  Get the crab? I mean, I'm going to try.
[3362.32s -> 3367.25s]  Maybe I have to net him.
[3367.25s -> 3372.11s]  I kind of want one of the dancing margaritas.
[3372.11s -> 3374.11s]  Seashell. No, no, no, no.
[3374.11s -> 3383.82s]  Wait. Get in there.
[3383.82s -> 3388.05s]  Does it like chocolate? Who likes chocolate?
[3388.05s -> 3397.38s]  Anybody like chocolate?
[3397.38s -> 3402.24s]  He loves chocolate. Hey, put that down.
[3402.24s -> 3406.78s]  Wait. Okay. I can get him.
[3406.78s -> 3408.78s]  Chocolate and then
[3408.78s -> 3416.26s]  crapple. You pick up seashells?
[3416.26s -> 3418.26s]  Oh, wait. I can. What can I do with
[3418.26s -> 3422.93s]  the seashell? All right. Get the
[3422.93s -> 3427.28s]  wevo.
[3427.28s -> 3430.86s]  Can I have six? She sells
[3430.86s -> 3432.86s]  seashells by the seashore. She sells
[3432.86s -> 3434.86s]  seashells by the seashore. She sells
[3434.86s -> 3436.86s]  seashells by the seashore. She sells
[3436.86s -> 3438.86s]  seashells by the seashore. She sells seashells
[3438.86s -> 3442.06s]  by the seashore. Almost.
[3442.06s -> 3444.56s]  Sometimes I can get it. What's that?
[3444.56s -> 3446.80s]  Put a ball in there.
[3446.80s -> 3454.74s]  Find grahamble on the beach.
[3454.74s -> 3457.81s]  Wait, wait, wait. There we go.
[3457.81s -> 3459.81s]  A snackery leaps in and out of the ocean
[3459.81s -> 3461.81s]  and needs to be caught in mid-leap. I don't
[3461.81s -> 3463.81s]  have a way to get that.
[3463.81s -> 3466.37s]  Wait. Can I like frisbee this
[3466.37s -> 3470.02s]  and hit it in the head? I probably can.
[3470.02s -> 3489.78s]  Damn it. All right.
[3489.78s -> 3494.38s]  Where's grahamble by the beach?
[3494.38s -> 3497.01s]  Wait. Do you like
[3497.01s -> 3500.34s]  chocolate? What's that thing?
[3500.34s -> 3502.34s]  It's a pineatella
[3502.34s -> 3504.34s]  that burrows into the sand to
[3504.34s -> 3506.34s]  hide. Perhaps another bug snack could dig
[3506.34s -> 3508.58s]  it out. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[3508.58s -> 3510.58s]  wait. Okay. So the crab digs that out and I can
[3510.58s -> 3514.27s]  catch them both. No.
[3514.27s -> 3518.82s]  What do you like? Loves
[3518.82s -> 3520.99s]  chocolate. Okay.
[3520.99s -> 3522.99s]  Here we go. I'm going to use you for
[3522.99s -> 3525.23s]  my own benefit. I'm going to coat
[3525.23s -> 3531.70s]  this with chocolate. No. Get away.
[3531.70s -> 3537.57s]  Get away.
[3537.57s -> 3544.80s]  Dig him out. Dig him out.
[3544.80s -> 3549.78s]  No. No.
[3549.78s -> 3551.78s]  All right. Well, whatever. I got you.
[3551.78s -> 3554.34s]  Oh, and my inventory's
[3554.34s -> 3556.34s]  full. Can I eat them myself?
[3556.34s -> 3558.70s]  Shit. I got to feed somebody. What do I do with
[3558.70s -> 3560.70s]  the bugs? What do I do with them?
[3560.70s -> 3573.04s]  Can I eat them? You have to find
[3573.04s -> 3577.39s]  grahamble. Find grahamble near
[3577.39s -> 3580.34s]  the beach. Who the fuck is
[3580.34s -> 3588.59s]  this person? Near the
[3588.59s -> 3590.59s]  founder. There's grahamble
[3590.59s -> 3592.59s]  and then there's somebody else.
[3592.59s -> 3595.47s]  Wiggle. This is KK
[3595.47s -> 3598.03s]  Slider. I can't wait for like the
[3598.03s -> 3617.17s]  quack, quack, quack, quack.
[3617.17s -> 3622.22s]  I'm sorry to interrupt,
[3622.22s -> 3628.56s]  but...
[3630.56s -> 3633.31s]  You're going to eat those?
[3633.31s -> 3635.31s]  Inspiration
[3635.31s -> 3637.31s]  is so hard to find.
[3637.31s -> 3639.55s]  I just have to sing
[3639.55s -> 3641.55s]  wherever it strikes me.
[3641.55s -> 3643.55s]  I feel that way too. I like this character.
[3643.55s -> 3645.55s]  Maybe it could strike you
[3645.55s -> 3648.93s]  over there. Oh, I'd hate
[3648.93s -> 3650.93s]  to go alone.
[3650.93s -> 3653.23s]  Won't you join me for a
[3653.23s -> 3655.23s]  long walk on the beach?
[3655.23s -> 3658.05s]  Like date?
[3658.05s -> 3660.05s]  Of course, darling.
[3660.05s -> 3662.05s]  It would just be you,
[3662.05s -> 3664.05s]  me, and
[3664.05s -> 3666.05s]  your delectable Strabby.
[3666.05s -> 3668.05s]  Singing the night away until
[3668.05s -> 3670.05s]  we drift off to sleep.
[3670.05s -> 3672.05s]  SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff.
[3672.05s -> 3674.22s]  Sorry.
[3674.22s -> 3676.22s]  Every time I go to sleep... Like artist depiction of
[3676.22s -> 3678.22s]  a new...
[3678.22s -> 3680.40s]  So no to all that.
[3680.40s -> 3682.40s]  But the date's still a maybe.
[3682.40s -> 3684.64s]  Very well.
[3684.64s -> 3686.94s]  I will go and
[3686.94s -> 3688.94s]  take my inspiration
[3688.94s -> 3692.85s]  home.
[3692.85s -> 3695.47s]  Mmm...
[3695.47s -> 3697.47s]  Tom, my dear.
[3697.47s -> 3699.47s]  Calm down, little ones.
[3699.47s -> 3701.47s]  Wiggle means well.
[3701.47s -> 3703.47s]  She just don't understand what I do.
[3716.08s -> 3722.42s]  Who are you?
[3722.42s -> 3724.42s]  You best turn back. These little ones
[3724.42s -> 3727.04s]  are my kin.
[3727.04s -> 3729.04s]  Well, that's a relief.
[3729.04s -> 3731.04s]  Sorry I'm short with that.
[3733.04s -> 3735.04s]  I'm Graham Wiggle. I'm an aspiring
[3735.04s -> 3738.43s]  Bugsnax breeder. Not too keen
[3738.43s -> 3740.43s]  on going to town, but I'm running
[3740.43s -> 3744.19s]  out of room back to my barn.
[3744.19s -> 3746.19s]  Trouble is, some of my snacks went
[3746.19s -> 3748.19s]  missing. I'm not going back
[3748.19s -> 3750.19s]  till they're all home. If you want
[3750.19s -> 3752.19s]  to help me, then I got a friend
[3752.19s -> 3754.19s]  to introduce you to. Follow me!
[3754.19s -> 3756.19s]  Bugsnax. Make him eat one.
[3756.19s -> 3774.61s]  Oh, shit. I can't
[3774.61s -> 3776.61s]  carry anymore.
[3776.61s -> 3778.61s]  See that, Strabby? That there's
[3778.61s -> 3780.85s]  Sprout. I've been training him to follow my
[3780.85s -> 3783.84s]  pointer in his buggy ball. Monkey ball!
[3783.84s -> 3785.84s]  We were in the middle of training. See if you can
[3785.84s -> 3787.84s]  guide Sprout back here to us.
[3787.84s -> 3790.46s]  Have a ball. Alright. Guide the
[3790.46s -> 3792.46s]  buggy ball through the course.
[3792.46s -> 3794.46s]  You got the buggy ball. Switch to it with
[3794.46s -> 3797.28s]  Q. Buggy ball?
[3797.28s -> 3802.08s]  Guide it. This is so cool.
[3802.08s -> 3808.93s]  Keep going. You can do it.
[3808.93s -> 3811.87s]  You can do it. Oh, that's
[3811.87s -> 3813.87s]  the worst part of the Wario level in
[3813.87s -> 3815.87s]  the N64 Wario Kart. I know.
[3815.87s -> 3817.87s]  Nice work, though. Keep going.
[3817.87s -> 3821.33s]  Nice. Keep going. You're almost there.
[3821.33s -> 3824.78s]  Up there.
[3824.78s -> 3827.54s]  You did it. Come on. Yes.
[3827.54s -> 3831.76s]  Bug, I did it.
[3846.40s -> 3848.40s]  Peel bugs.
[3854.40s -> 3856.40s]  Eat him. Wait, and pick up
[3856.40s -> 3858.70s]  this guy and eat him?
[3858.70s -> 3862.03s]  But I have...
[3862.03s -> 3864.03s]  I have too much stuff in my inventory.
[3864.03s -> 3866.53s]  Do I have a storage unit or
[3866.53s -> 3868.53s]  something? How do I...
[3868.53s -> 3871.73s]  How would I...
[3871.73s -> 3874.03s]  Wow. I want that one.
[3874.03s -> 3876.03s]  Release them. Release them. No.
[3876.03s -> 3884.35s]  They're mine. Feed the dude in
[3884.35s -> 3891.38s]  town.
[3891.38s -> 3893.38s]  Alright, I'll release...
[3893.38s -> 3895.38s]  Okay. I will release
[3895.38s -> 3904.40s]  one of each. We're doing it
[3904.40s -> 3906.40s]  fair. I'm picking them at random.
[3906.40s -> 3915.22s]  There. Okay, now I need to get
[3915.22s -> 3917.22s]  three of these guys as his peel bugs.
[3917.22s -> 3919.22s]  He said that this is randomly... They're in holes
[3919.22s -> 3924.34s]  on the beach. Holes on the beach.
[3924.34s -> 3929.20s]  Peel bug.
[3929.20s -> 3932.14s]  You eat them. I don't know how.
[3932.14s -> 3934.70s]  I didn't learn how to do that.
[3934.70s -> 3937.26s]  Is that a peel bug? No.
[3937.26s -> 3941.81s]  That's a pinata.
[3941.81s -> 3950.13s]  Holes on the ground.
[3950.13s -> 3952.13s]  Gigantic bits. Oh, shit.
[3952.13s -> 3954.13s]  Gigantic bits did come in. And also,
[3954.13s -> 3956.37s]  let's start with
[3956.37s -> 3958.37s]  Red Lemonade gave five community subs,
[3958.37s -> 3960.74s]  but they were Tier 2.
[3960.74s -> 3962.74s]  That's Tier 2 community subs from Red Lemonade.
[3962.74s -> 3964.74s]  That's nuts.
[3964.74s -> 3966.74s]  Thank you for those. And then
[3966.74s -> 3968.74s]  ten thousand bits.
[3968.74s -> 3970.74s]  A hundred bucks in bits from
[3970.74s -> 3972.74s]  I'm...
[3972.74s -> 3975.42s]  I'm Omo89.
[3975.42s -> 3978.62s]  Thank you, Omo. Thanks for the hundred fucking dollars.
[3978.62s -> 3982.98s]  Jeremy, thanks for all the constant entertainment
[3982.98s -> 3984.98s]  throughout all these years. It's impossible to quantify
[3984.98s -> 3986.98s]  how much happiness you've provided.
[3986.98s -> 3988.98s]  So consider this a small token of my appreciation.
[3988.98s -> 3993.52s]  I...
[3993.52s -> 3995.52s]  You're never under any obligation to give me
[3995.52s -> 3999.23s]  a cent. So
[3999.23s -> 4004.16s]  you just hanging out here is enough for me.
[4004.16s -> 4006.16s]  Thank you nonetheless and happy to have you.
[4006.16s -> 4010.58s]  Now let's kill some bugs.
[4010.58s -> 4015.06s]  Thanks for the hundred bucks.
[4015.06s -> 4022.99s]  That's a lot of money. I don't see any holes on the
[4022.99s -> 4025.23s]  beach, do you? Wait.
[4025.23s -> 4027.23s]  Like, is that a peel bug?
[4027.23s -> 4030.37s]  Catch lost peal...
[4030.37s -> 4032.37s]  It's definitely there. It's like the basketball bug.
[4032.37s -> 4035.95s]  That's a peel bug. It rolls up
[4035.95s -> 4037.95s]  and hides inside holes or logs. They'll have to
[4037.95s -> 4039.95s]  be pushed out somehow. Oh, I know
[4039.95s -> 4043.28s]  what to do. Wait.
[4043.28s -> 4048.46s]  Oh, shit. All right. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait,
[4048.46s -> 4051.47s]  wait, wait. All right. Push him out.
[4051.47s -> 4060.42s]  Come here. Oh, wait.
[4060.42s -> 4062.42s]  Is there a way I can quickly activate this
[4062.42s -> 4065.94s]  instead of switching? Or do I have
[4065.94s -> 4068.18s]  to switch to it? All right. This one.
[4068.18s -> 4075.47s]  Get away from me.
[4075.47s -> 4080.27s]  For another peel bug. I like the orange peel bugs.
[4080.27s -> 4087.50s]  They look delicious.
[4087.50s -> 4089.50s]  Is there a peel bug in there? Nope. Just a squidward.
[4089.50s -> 4093.73s]  Number keys are tools.
[4093.73s -> 4097.76s]  Oh, okay. Come on over here.
[4097.76s -> 4107.17s]  I need you. Come here.
[4107.17s -> 4115.15s]  Two. Come on over here.
[4115.15s -> 4120.34s]  Outside of memes, how is...
[4120.34s -> 4122.34s]  How good is this game?
[4122.34s -> 4124.51s]  It's kind of good.
[4124.51s -> 4126.51s]  It's just relaxing and
[4126.51s -> 4129.01s]  fun. This is a chill game.
[4129.01s -> 4135.15s]  I like it. What about Elden Ring?
[4135.15s -> 4138.03s]  What about Elden Ring?
[4138.03s -> 4140.85s]  I haven't played... I'm not
[4140.85s -> 4144.75s]  currently playing Elden Ring. Come on.
[4144.75s -> 4149.04s]  I need one more. True. True.
[4149.04s -> 4156.40s]  True. What do you mean true?
[4156.40s -> 4158.64s]  Do I have to reload the area? I don't see
[4158.64s -> 4167.15s]  any more orange bugs. Where are they?
[4167.15s -> 4175.39s]  Hello? You only needed
[4175.39s -> 4183.52s]  two? No, I need one more.
[4183.52s -> 4185.52s]  Look around more, you dingus.
[4185.52s -> 4188.27s]  I'm, you know, on the beach. What are you talking about?
[4188.27s -> 4201.38s]  Clefairy.
[4201.38s -> 4203.38s]  Every time I say a mean comment, I'm going to do
[4203.38s -> 4209.46s]  Clefairy. In here?
[4209.46s -> 4214.82s]  There's definitely one in here. Fuck off.
[4214.82s -> 4216.82s]  Oh, yeah? Clefairy. How does
[4216.82s -> 4218.82s]  that sound? Oh, another one. Clefairy.
[4218.82s -> 4220.99s]  Oh, another one. I know. You call me
[4220.99s -> 4222.99s]  a dickhead? Clefairy.
[4222.99s -> 4233.34s]  I can go all day, man.
[4233.34s -> 4236.03s]  Elemo Cleary. I've got
[4236.03s -> 4240.96s]  your snacks. You got my
[4240.96s -> 4242.96s]  snacks. I have the embodiment of the Stinky
[4242.96s -> 4244.96s]  Cheese emote. No.
[4244.96s -> 4246.96s]  What? How? Explain.
[4246.96s -> 4249.65s]  Why do I get that
[4249.65s -> 4251.65s]  but I don't get it?
[4251.65s -> 4253.65s]  Get out of here. That's bullshit.
[4259.65s -> 4261.65s]  I thought this guy didn't like eating these things.
[4261.65s -> 4264.53s]  Sauce
[4264.53s -> 4266.53s]  Buggy Ball with Chocolate lead to
[4266.53s -> 4268.53s]  quibbles to grumble without trapping them.
[4268.53s -> 4270.96s]  That's fun.
[4270.96s -> 4273.50s]  All right. Come on.
[4273.50s -> 4279.01s]  Come on, quibble.
[4279.01s -> 4282.64s]  Get over here. Chocolate.
[4282.64s -> 4291.65s]  All right. Come get it.
[4291.65s -> 4296.00s]  Where are the quibbles?
[4296.00s -> 4300.03s]  Quibble. He loves it.
[4300.03s -> 4302.34s]  Bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon.
[4302.34s -> 4304.34s]  It's bacon.
[4304.34s -> 4308.11s]  It's bacon.
[4308.11s -> 4311.38s]  Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.
[4311.38s -> 4315.73s]  Bacon, bacon, bacon.
[4315.73s -> 4317.73s]  Dogs don't know it's not bacon. It's
[4317.73s -> 4322.59s]  bacon. Get in there.
[4322.59s -> 4325.86s]  I used to
[4325.86s -> 4327.86s]  love that commercial when I was younger.
[4327.86s -> 4329.86s]  I thought it was the funniest goddamn thing in the world.
[4329.86s -> 4332.67s]  It was like the GoPro
[4332.67s -> 4334.67s]  POV of the dog nose running around going
[4334.67s -> 4336.85s]  bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon.
[4336.85s -> 4343.95s]  It's such a great commercial.
[4343.95s -> 4348.50s]  Began Strips. Yeah.
[4348.50s -> 4351.55s]  Show it? Hold on.
[4351.55s -> 4353.55s]  Dogs don't know
[4353.55s -> 4355.55s]  it's not bacon. It's bacon.
[4355.55s -> 4358.37s]  Began Strips
[4358.37s -> 4368.35s]  commercial.
[4368.35s -> 4373.66s]  What's the right one?
[4373.66s -> 4379.04s]  It's definitely this one.
[4379.04s -> 4406.03s]  Bacon.
[4406.03s -> 4408.03s]  Here you go. It's Began Strips.
[4408.03s -> 4410.03s]  Brand dog snack from Purina.
[4410.03s -> 4412.03s]  Began Strips. Dogs don't know it's not bacon.
[4412.03s -> 4414.03s]  It's bacon.
[4414.03s -> 4416.03s]  Wait.
[4416.03s -> 4418.03s]  There's a 20. They redid it.
[4418.03s -> 4420.03s]  All right. We're going to see if the remake is any better.
[4420.03s -> 4425.73s]  Hold on. Let's see if the remake is any better.
[4433.33s -> 4441.97s]  Nope. Not as good.
[4441.97s -> 4444.34s]  Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum. It's done.
[4444.34s -> 4449.01s]  No, not even close.
[4449.01s -> 4451.01s]  No, no, no, no. I'm sorry.
[4451.01s -> 4453.25s]  I'm sorry. Wait, there's another one?
[4464.08s -> 4467.15s]  No, it's not as good.
[4467.15s -> 4469.15s]  No, it's not as good.
[4469.15s -> 4471.90s]  Is there another one?
[4471.90s -> 4473.90s]  Where's the original one? No, fuck these new ones.
[4473.90s -> 4475.90s]  I want the old voice.
[4475.90s -> 4484.22s]  Do it.
[4484.22s -> 4489.97s]  What the hell? It's frozen.
[4489.97s -> 4497.20s]  There we go. Okay.
[4497.20s -> 4499.20s]  Let's compare the voices. It's much better.
[4514.74s -> 4516.74s]  It's bacon.
[4516.74s -> 4520.90s]  There you go.
[4520.90s -> 4522.90s]  No, it's Began Strips. Brand dog snack from Purina.
[4522.90s -> 4524.90s]  Began Strips.
[4524.90s -> 4526.90s]  Dogs don't know it's not bacon.
[4526.90s -> 4528.90s]  It's bacon.
[4528.90s -> 4534.98s]  It's way better.
[4534.98s -> 4540.03s]  Is it John Madden?
[4540.03s -> 4542.03s]  It actually does sound like John Madden.
[4542.03s -> 4546.00s]  What if it was him?
[4546.00s -> 4554.26s]  It's John Madden. Get away from my ball.
[4554.26s -> 4556.26s]  That's not for you.
[4556.26s -> 4558.26s]  That's for the other dogs.
[4558.26s -> 4560.26s]  All right. Where, where, where, where, where?
[4560.26s -> 4562.26s]  I need another nose guy.
[4562.26s -> 4567.50s]  Excuse me.
[4567.50s -> 4569.94s]  Excuse me.
[4569.94s -> 4571.94s]  I can't whistles. You know the one that goes
[4571.94s -> 4575.39s]  I can't do it.
[4575.39s -> 4577.39s]  But like, you know exactly what I'm trying to do.
[4577.39s -> 4579.82s]  Like that.
[4579.82s -> 4583.02s]  Come here.
[4583.02s -> 4585.02s]  There you are.
[4585.02s -> 4587.02s]  Like what I got. A tasty snack.
[4587.02s -> 4594.43s]  Let me go first.
[4594.43s -> 4596.43s]  I gotta have that bacon. Bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon.
[4596.43s -> 4598.43s]  Smoky bacon.
[4598.43s -> 4610.21s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[4610.21s -> 4616.42s]  Doesn't it stink? You love things that stink.
[4616.42s -> 4618.42s]  Go in there.
[4618.42s -> 4620.42s]  Ashley, you're back.
[4620.42s -> 4622.42s]  Don't you ever leave me again.
[4622.42s -> 4625.10s]  All right.
[4625.10s -> 4627.10s]  Where's my money?
[4627.10s -> 4629.66s]  You did it.
[4629.66s -> 4631.66s]  My kin are all together again.
[4631.66s -> 4633.66s]  I'm so happy I could cry.
[4633.66s -> 4635.66s]  Here goes.
[4637.66s -> 4642.66s]  Ew.
[4642.66s -> 4644.66s]  I'm ready to head back to the ranch.
[4644.66s -> 4646.66s]  Thanks for all your help.
[4646.66s -> 4648.66s]  Sprout.
[4648.66s -> 4650.66s]  Is this the ball?
[4658.19s -> 4660.19s]  It's really loud now because I turned it up.
[4660.19s -> 4662.56s]  Yeah, we're good now.
[4662.56s -> 4665.68s]  A little bit lower. We're good.
[4667.68s -> 4669.68s]  Is there oxygen in there?
[4683.49s -> 4685.98s]  Okay.
[4685.98s -> 4687.98s]  Go see what Befika wants.
[4687.98s -> 4691.25s]  Look at this.
[4691.25s -> 4693.55s]  Cool.
[4693.55s -> 4697.26s]  Look at this little happy family.
[4697.26s -> 4705.84s]  All right. We'll go talk to Befika.
[4705.84s -> 4712.69s]  Throw the sprout in the ocean and never come back.
[4722.98s -> 4724.98s]  This guy here.
[4724.98s -> 4730.46s]  That guy. There he is.
[4730.46s -> 4732.46s]  That's the one.
[4732.46s -> 4734.46s]  I'm going good.
[4734.46s -> 4736.46s]  And I've got something for you.
[4736.46s -> 4738.46s]  I've got a crab apple
[4738.46s -> 4740.46s]  for you. You're going to love it.
[4740.46s -> 4745.90s]  Oh, wow. That looks uncomfortable.
[4745.90s -> 4751.41s]  Hey, come here.
[4751.41s -> 4753.41s]  Let's make you even more of a monster.
[4753.41s -> 4766.38s]  We have huge teeth.
[4766.38s -> 4768.38s]  So is this like the way to show your wealth
[4768.38s -> 4771.01s]  in this society?
[4771.01s -> 4773.01s]  There's a guy with a bunch of fruits all over him
[4773.01s -> 4775.01s]  and vegetable noses and stuff.
[4775.01s -> 4777.01s]  Is that kind of like the top hat of this society?
[4777.01s -> 4779.95s]  The people that are walking around
[4779.95s -> 4781.95s]  with just regular clothes and no fruits.
[4781.95s -> 4784.19s]  They're like lower on society.
[4790.27s -> 4797.38s]  Wait.
[4797.38s -> 4799.38s]  We've got some drama.
[4802.51s -> 4805.14s]  You made that man an elite.
[4809.14s -> 4811.14s]  Not really.
[4811.14s -> 4813.14s]  I had that guy win
[4813.14s -> 4815.14s]  a car on a game show.
[4815.14s -> 4817.14s]  But he didn't realize
[4817.14s -> 4819.14s]  that you have to pay taxes on the car.
[4822.66s -> 4824.66s]  Don't ever take the car
[4824.66s -> 4826.66s]  on a game show if you're ever on one.
[4826.66s -> 4830.69s]  Take the money.
[4830.69s -> 4832.69s]  You guys have a problem. What is it?
[4832.69s -> 4835.82s]  Let's interview this guy.
[4845.04s -> 4847.04s]  Who are you?
[4849.41s -> 4851.41s]  Why did you come to Snark Tooth Island?
[4853.41s -> 4855.41s]  Why did you not do a farm back home?
[4860.80s -> 4864.26s]  I didn't take the house on the game show
[4864.26s -> 4866.26s]  like you did.
[4866.26s -> 4872.59s]  Thoughts on bug snacks?
[4875.54s -> 4878.80s]  What's so confusing about them?
[4883.42s -> 4885.42s]  It's Arthur Morgan.
[4893.66s -> 4895.66s]  Well eat them raw or
[4895.66s -> 4897.66s]  that's the really nice way to say eat them alive.
[4909.89s -> 4911.89s]  So we would have been fine on
[4911.89s -> 4913.89s]  bug snacks if it weren't for Gramble.
[4917.89s -> 4919.89s]  That weepy little
[4919.89s -> 4921.89s]  rancher thinks all
[4921.89s -> 4923.89s]  bug snacks are his pets.
[4955.09s -> 4957.09s]  That's good.
[4957.09s -> 4959.09s]  Thank god that's not recorded.
[4959.09s -> 4961.09s]  We're good.
[4965.46s -> 4967.46s]  Thank god.
[4970.02s -> 4974.18s]  I'm so happy
[4974.18s -> 4976.18s]  that it didn't get recorded.
[4980.18s -> 4982.18s]  What did you do?
[4984.18s -> 4986.18s]  You must know.
[4986.18s -> 4988.18s]  After that sound happened
[4988.18s -> 4990.18s]  I waited about like a half a second
[4990.18s -> 4997.41s]  and I went
[4997.41s -> 4999.41s]  It was disgusting.
[5013.26s -> 5015.26s]  Worse?
[5015.26s -> 5017.26s]  Well that's why I'm glad it didn't get picked up.
[5017.26s -> 5019.26s]  It's fun to talk about it
[5019.26s -> 5021.57s]  but it's not fun to live it.
[5021.57s -> 5023.57s]  Okay
[5023.57s -> 5026.45s]  snooze boring.
[5026.45s -> 5028.45s]  Thanks for your time.
[5038.62s -> 5042.14s]  What is this?
[5042.14s -> 5045.47s]  Wambus gave you notes about
[5045.47s -> 5047.47s]  a strange device.
[5047.47s -> 5050.48s]  Strange device
[5050.48s -> 5052.48s]  now we're getting intriguing.
[5052.48s -> 5055.04s]  What the heck?
[5055.04s -> 5060.34s]  What is this?
[5060.34s -> 5062.64s]  Let me see.
[5062.64s -> 5065.14s]  An activator.
[5065.14s -> 5069.15s]  I have this?
[5069.15s -> 5071.58s]  Where is it?
[5071.58s -> 5073.58s]  Okay.
[5073.58s -> 5075.58s]  The door is attached to some ancient mechanisms.
[5075.58s -> 5077.58s]  It looks like
[5077.58s -> 5079.58s]  it might take at least three grumpuses
[5079.58s -> 5082.14s]  to activate these.
[5082.14s -> 5086.82s]  Okay.
[5086.82s -> 5089.76s]  You know what's funny?
[5089.76s -> 5091.76s]  It doesn't matter what game I'm playing.
[5091.76s -> 5093.76s]  I always think it's funny to look over here
[5093.76s -> 5095.76s]  and say
[5095.76s -> 5099.54s]  why are you playing this?
[5099.54s -> 5101.54s]  I don't know. Why do anything?
[5101.54s -> 5108.83s]  At least a few times
[5108.83s -> 5110.83s]  I'll look over here and just see
[5110.83s -> 5114.48s]  why are you playing this?
[5114.48s -> 5116.48s]  I want to make this video games release
[5116.48s -> 5118.48s]  and I play them when they come out sometimes
[5118.48s -> 5120.48s]  and I just play games.
[5120.48s -> 5123.55s]  I don't know.
[5123.55s -> 5125.55s]  Why are you still playing this?
[5125.55s -> 5129.97s]  This is another good one.
[5129.97s -> 5131.97s]  I came back from a shower
[5131.97s -> 5133.97s]  and went out with my friends
[5133.97s -> 5135.97s]  and said why are you still playing this?
[5135.97s -> 5138.53s]  I don't know man. It would be nice to go out
[5138.53s -> 5141.02s]  with your friends, huh?
[5141.02s -> 5143.02s]  I'm trapped here.
[5143.02s -> 5147.31s]  You need help.
[5149.31s -> 5151.31s]  Go outside.
[5159.31s -> 5161.31s]  That was everyone last stream.
[5161.31s -> 5163.31s]  Yeah, that had to have been the most
[5163.31s -> 5166.24s]  ever.
[5166.24s -> 5168.24s]  Of the like why are you still here?
[5168.24s -> 5170.24s]  You're torturing us. We don't talk about
[5170.24s -> 5172.24s]  yesterday's stream.
[5172.24s -> 5174.24s]  Yesterday's stream.
[5174.24s -> 5177.36s]  What's the
[5177.36s -> 5179.36s]  not breaking
[5179.36s -> 5181.36s]  bad
[5181.36s -> 5183.36s]  what's it called?
[5183.36s -> 5187.39s]  Big Bang Theory.
[5187.39s -> 5189.39s]  Math, science, history. It's all of the history.
[5189.39s -> 5191.39s]  It all started. That doesn't make any sense.
[5191.39s -> 5195.30s]  What am I trying to say to you guys?
[5195.30s -> 5197.30s]  Isn't there a line in the
[5197.30s -> 5199.30s]  Big Bang Theory that's like
[5199.30s -> 5201.30s]  oh history but
[5201.30s -> 5205.52s]  Ford is a mystery or something?
[5205.52s -> 5211.41s]  It's like a song. What we have here
[5211.41s -> 5213.41s]  is history like Ford is a mystery.
[5213.41s -> 5217.50s]  What is it from?
[5217.50s -> 5228.38s]  That's from Kung Fu Panda. That's from
[5228.38s -> 5236.62s]  Karazhan. What is it?
[5236.62s -> 5238.62s]  Math, science, history unraveling the mystery.
[5238.62s -> 5240.62s]  No no but there's another one.
[5244.62s -> 5246.62s]  I made it up. No I didn't.
[5246.62s -> 5248.62s]  Yesterday was history. Tomorrow is a
[5248.62s -> 5250.62s]  mystery. Yeah what is it? Who said that?
[5250.62s -> 5252.62s]  Like Mark Twain? Who said that?
[5252.62s -> 5254.62s]  Seems promising to me.
[5254.62s -> 5256.62s]  All I need to start off is a root
[5256.62s -> 5258.62s]  and a fruit.
[5258.62s -> 5260.62s]  It's Kung Fu Panda.
[5260.62s -> 5262.62s]  Another fine day behind us.
[5262.62s -> 5264.62s]  Okay from Kung Fu Panda when
[5264.62s -> 5266.62s]  whatever the snake says that.
[5266.62s -> 5277.36s]  Fine day behind us.
[5277.36s -> 5279.36s]  That was a second video. The second
[5279.36s -> 5281.36s]  Jerma video title. Wait what?
[5281.36s -> 5283.36s]  Is that where his memory is coming from?
[5283.36s -> 5285.36s]  That's a video title.
[5285.36s -> 5289.20s]  And I thought it was
[5289.20s -> 5291.20s]  the intro to the Big Bang Theory.
[5291.20s -> 5297.79s]  These memories are
[5297.79s -> 5299.79s]  insane. Okay so wait that was just
[5299.79s -> 5301.79s]  a second Jerma title?
[5301.79s -> 5303.79s]  It's from a thumbnail.
[5303.79s -> 5312.37s]  Wait it's from this one.
[5312.37s -> 5314.37s]  Wait wait wait wait wait wait.
[5314.37s -> 5316.37s]  I need to see.
[5316.37s -> 5318.86s]  This video is called
[5318.86s -> 5320.86s]  Yesterday is history. Tomorrow
[5320.86s -> 5322.86s]  is a mystery.
[5322.86s -> 5324.86s]  It all started with a Big Bang.
[5324.86s -> 5340.67s]  Oh boy
[5340.67s -> 5342.67s]  oh boy. It's not from Kung
[5342.67s -> 5344.67s]  Fu Panda. What are you talking about?
[5344.67s -> 5346.67s]  It's a title of one of my videos.
[5346.67s -> 5356.66s]  Okay plant a root
[5356.66s -> 5359.86s]  bug snack in the garden.
[5359.86s -> 5361.86s]  I missed all that because I was like having
[5361.86s -> 5363.86s]  trouble. Alright what am I doing?
[5363.86s -> 5368.53s]  Plant a fruit bug snack
[5368.53s -> 5370.53s]  in the garden. Okay I gotta plant fruits
[5370.53s -> 5372.53s]  in the garden. Where's the garden?
[5372.53s -> 5374.53s]  Another fine day behind us. Quiet.
[5374.53s -> 5377.66s]  Where's the garden?
[5377.66s -> 5379.90s]  Is all going well?
[5379.90s -> 5388.98s]  Where's the garden? Garden?
[5388.98s -> 5390.98s]  Alright garden. Garden Grove.
[5390.98s -> 5392.98s]  Alright I gotta go to Garden Grove.
[5392.98s -> 5403.41s]  Snackberg. This is Garden Grove coming up here?
[5403.41s -> 5408.83s]  Nope. What's this?
[5408.83s -> 5410.83s]  Garden Grove? Garden Grove.
[5410.83s -> 5419.41s]  You went right past it.
[5419.41s -> 5421.41s]  Wait the garden. Not this.
[5421.41s -> 5424.54s]  We gotta talk to you anyways.
[5424.54s -> 5428.75s]  Okay.
[5441.12s -> 5443.12s]  Jerma the fucking link. Jerma the fucking link.
[5443.12s -> 5445.68s]  You guys need to calm down
[5445.68s -> 5448.37s]  before you get me angry. Link.
[5448.37s -> 5451.76s]  This is from
[5451.76s -> 5453.76s]  Kung Fu Panda.
[5460.64s -> 5462.64s]  Yesterday
[5462.64s -> 5464.64s]  is history.
[5464.64s -> 5466.64s]  Tomorrow is a mystery.
[5466.64s -> 5468.64s]  But today is a gift.
[5468.64s -> 5470.64s]  That is why it is called
[5470.64s -> 5473.07s]  the present.
[5473.07s -> 5475.07s]  Oh I didn't do the second half.
[5475.07s -> 5484.93s]  I stole that from
[5484.93s -> 5486.93s]  Kung Fu Panda. No I didn't.
[5486.93s -> 5488.93s]  I remembered it from the Big Bang
[5488.93s -> 5490.93s]  theory but I actually remembered
[5490.93s -> 5492.93s]  it from the title of one of my videos.
[5492.93s -> 5494.93s]  But it's truly
[5494.93s -> 5497.10s]  from Kung Fu Panda.
[5497.10s -> 5504.53s]  You understand? Scan six
[5504.53s -> 5506.53s]  types of bug snacks in Garden Grove.
[5506.53s -> 5509.28s]  Got it.
[5509.28s -> 5511.28s]  I already got that one.
[5511.28s -> 5513.46s]  Who am I missing? What's this?
[5513.46s -> 5515.95s]  Candy Patch?
[5515.95s -> 5518.13s]  Apologize. Why?
[5518.13s -> 5525.94s]  Some bugs only come out at night.
[5525.94s -> 5527.94s]  So it's kind of like Stardew Valley fishing.
[5527.94s -> 5530.48s]  That's cool. I'm gonna
[5530.48s -> 5533.04s]  do this. What about in the cave?
[5533.04s -> 5535.04s]  I already got the fries.
[5535.04s -> 5548.53s]  I already got the burger.
[5548.53s -> 5550.53s]  Oh and that's you. Okay.
[5550.53s -> 5552.53s]  Um how do I get any other
[5552.53s -> 5558.29s]  bugs to come out?
[5558.29s -> 5560.29s]  Wait hold on. Oh that's a different one.
[5560.29s -> 5562.29s]  That's a white strappy.
[5562.29s -> 5567.66s]  That's a scare snack.
[5567.66s -> 5570.74s]  Okay so it scares away the snacks.
[5570.74s -> 5572.74s]  It's a poop pile.
[5572.74s -> 5574.74s]  Buried bug snack. These bug snacks have been
[5574.74s -> 5579.34s]  planted in the ground like crops.
[5579.34s -> 5581.84s]  Is that a hot dog? Oh my god.
[5581.84s -> 5586.26s]  It's a hot dog.
[5586.26s -> 5588.26s]  I need one more. But wait I want to get a hot dog.
[5588.26s -> 5595.54s]  I love him.
[5595.54s -> 5598.61s]  I love him. What's wrong with him?
[5598.61s -> 5600.85s]  He loves ketchup.
[5600.85s -> 5602.85s]  Okay. You love ketchup so much. We'll go over there.
[5602.85s -> 5615.65s]  Get the glissy.
[5615.65s -> 5621.02s]  Glissy. What's a glissy?
[5621.02s -> 5623.58s]  What's a glissy? Glissy?
[5623.58s -> 5627.23s]  I want this thing though.
[5627.23s -> 5634.83s]  What do you like? What are your interests?
[5634.83s -> 5640.66s]  You like chocolate? You love
[5640.66s -> 5642.66s]  chocolate. Well I don't think I even need to get
[5642.66s -> 5645.90s]  that. It's ketchup.
[5645.90s -> 5650.58s]  Hey a white strappy.
[5650.58s -> 5653.20s]  Where do I go?
[5653.20s -> 5655.95s]  Okay over here.
[5655.95s -> 5657.95s]  Do I pick up one of the poop guys?
[5657.95s -> 5662.05s]  It's a pickle.
[5662.05s -> 5664.35s]  Hinkle. Oh let's dig him up.
[5664.35s -> 5674.08s]  Is he dead? No I don't want to go to
[5674.08s -> 5676.08s]  Flavor Falls. That's a killer.
[5676.08s -> 5678.45s]  Oh man. He knocked it out of the
[5678.45s -> 5680.45s]  park man. We're at a joint.
[5680.45s -> 5683.38s]  Oh that's a killer.
[5683.38s -> 5690.74s]  Hey you guys know that
[5690.74s -> 5692.74s]  I've watched a few diners drive-ins
[5692.74s -> 5694.74s]  and dives recently.
[5694.74s -> 5696.74s]  And he's really trying to get his son to take over.
[5696.74s -> 5698.74s]  I don't want to fucking do that anymore.
[5698.74s -> 5700.74s]  He keeps like putting his kind of older
[5700.74s -> 5702.74s]  son into the camera and stuff. It's like
[5702.74s -> 5704.74s]  oh this is my son Hunter.
[5704.74s -> 5707.23s]  And Hunter's like oh man that's delicious.
[5707.23s -> 5709.23s]  Flavor Town. He's like training his son
[5709.23s -> 5711.23s]  to take over the business so he can stop doing diners
[5711.23s -> 5714.82s]  drive-ins and dives. It's actually
[5714.82s -> 5716.82s]  kind of funny. It's like kind of wholesome in a way.
[5716.82s -> 5718.82s]  Because his son is
[5718.82s -> 5720.82s]  old enough now where he's kind of getting more
[5720.82s -> 5722.82s]  comfortable on camera and they both have like similar
[5722.82s -> 5724.82s]  catch phrases. You can tell he's like kind of
[5724.82s -> 5727.50s]  doing the catch phrases.
[5727.50s -> 5729.50s]  Oh man, you totally killed it.
[5729.50s -> 5731.50s]  You knocked it out of the park man.
[5731.50s -> 5733.50s]  Yeah you knocked it out of the park. Right Hunter?
[5733.50s -> 5735.50s]  And then eventually like he'll
[5735.50s -> 5737.50s]  he's gonna, but is he gonna have the hair?
[5737.50s -> 5739.50s]  I really hope
[5739.50s -> 5741.50s]  that they do a full, a full complete
[5741.50s -> 5743.50s]  transition from like father to son.
[5743.50s -> 5745.50s]  And he gets the hair and he gets
[5745.50s -> 5747.50s]  the blonde hair and the blonde goatee.
[5747.50s -> 5749.74s]  That would be unbelievable.
[5749.74s -> 5751.74s]  I would watch every episode.
[5751.74s -> 5755.52s]  They must always be a lich
[5755.52s -> 5757.52s]  king. Yes, they must always
[5757.52s -> 5759.52s]  be a lich king.
[5759.52s -> 5761.52s]  Otherwise the whole society collapses.
[5761.52s -> 5766.77s]  Without a
[5766.77s -> 5768.77s]  Guy Fieri
[5768.77s -> 5771.07s]  the whole thing comes down.
[5771.07s -> 5773.07s]  They must, oh I love that.
[5773.07s -> 5777.36s]  Fucking mod that guy for an hour.
[5777.36s -> 5782.67s]  Flavor King.
[5782.67s -> 5787.78s]  Where is this other bug?
[5787.78s -> 5793.54s]  I don't know where this other bug is.
[5793.54s -> 5795.54s]  Dude, don't put it past him man. World of
[5795.54s -> 5797.54s]  Warcraft's running out of shit to talk about.
[5797.54s -> 5800.86s]  Do not be surprised
[5800.86s -> 5802.86s]  if in ten years when World of Warcraft
[5802.86s -> 5804.86s]  is on its 30th expansion.
[5804.86s -> 5806.86s]  It's like, well, I guess like we
[5806.86s -> 5808.86s]  went to the place where everybody was dead.
[5808.86s -> 5811.23s]  We went to space.
[5811.23s -> 5813.23s]  We went to the center
[5813.23s -> 5815.73s]  of the fucking earth. We went
[5815.73s -> 5817.73s]  to hell. We went to heaven. I guess we're
[5817.73s -> 5820.61s]  gonna go to Flavortown. That's
[5820.61s -> 5822.78s]  what's left. And like Disney.
[5822.78s -> 5833.28s]  Like Disney World. Now should
[5833.28s -> 5835.28s]  I dig this up? Where this last
[5835.28s -> 5837.28s]  is one more bug? Where's this pickle bug?
[5837.28s -> 5842.58s]  Something in there.
[5842.58s -> 5844.58s]  I would play that expansion. That
[5844.58s -> 5846.58s]  would be the only thing that would bring me back to well.
[5846.58s -> 5849.07s]  And I'm talking about a fully
[5849.07s -> 5851.07s]  voice acted, but still in
[5851.07s -> 5853.07s]  kind of like the shitty World of Warcraft
[5853.07s -> 5855.07s]  engine Guy Fieri. And it's just
[5855.07s -> 5857.07s]  a human model. Just the standard
[5857.07s -> 5859.07s]  human model that they just gave a
[5859.07s -> 5861.07s]  blonde goatee and spiky blonde
[5861.07s -> 5863.70s]  hair to. Cause that's what they're
[5863.70s -> 5875.60s]  capable of doing. I got a pee.
[5875.60s -> 5877.60s]  I'll be right back. It's pee time.
[5877.60s -> 6122.21s]  You know, I don't understand how it gets so hot
[6122.21s -> 6125.86s]  in here. When I'm sitting in
[6125.86s -> 6128.16s]  this room, do I just
[6128.16s -> 6130.78s]  eliminate heat?
[6130.78s -> 6132.78s]  Inside of this room, it has
[6132.78s -> 6134.96s]  to be 10 degrees hotter
[6134.96s -> 6136.96s]  than the next room out of this
[6136.96s -> 6141.49s]  door. Wow.
[6141.49s -> 6145.20s]  It's cold. Let's go.
[6145.20s -> 6149.10s]  World of Warcraft.
[6149.10s -> 6151.60s]  Can you imagine? Sorry.
[6151.60s -> 6154.93s]  Where was I? I need to get six bugs.
[6154.93s -> 6160.37s]  It's cold in Nevada. Oh yeah.
[6160.37s -> 6162.37s]  It gets really cold in Nevada.
[6162.37s -> 6165.76s]  That's a sweetie fly.
[6165.76s -> 6168.96s]  It eventually sits down to
[6168.96s -> 6171.84s]  rest. Where? Up in the
[6171.84s -> 6176.90s]  sky. Remember, Nevada's the desert.
[6176.90s -> 6178.90s]  So it gets really, really, really
[6178.90s -> 6180.90s]  hot and really, really, really cold.
[6180.90s -> 6187.17s]  There's really no in-between in Nevada.
[6187.17s -> 6190.43s]  I scanned all the things.
[6199.25s -> 6201.25s]  Click the link, please.
[6201.25s -> 6203.25s]  Here's the- but I don't understand.
[6203.25s -> 6205.25s]  Why is he not like a dwarf
[6205.25s -> 6207.25s]  or a human?
[6207.25s -> 6209.25s]  I don't think- I wouldn't consider Guy
[6209.25s -> 6211.25s]  Fieri to be a- like a blood elf.
[6215.25s -> 6217.25s]  Would you?
[6217.25s -> 6219.25s]  Hold on, what can I- where is this?
[6219.25s -> 6221.25s]  Oh, there we go. Yeah, I don't think-
[6221.25s -> 6223.25s]  I don't see this to be actually
[6223.25s -> 6225.25s]  an actual bug.
[6225.25s -> 6234.08s]  I don't see this to be an actual
[6234.08s -> 6237.52s]  bug.
[6237.52s -> 6239.52s]  I don't think- I don't see
[6239.52s -> 6242.02s]  this to be accurate.
[6242.02s -> 6244.02s]  That's Guy Fieri.
[6244.02s -> 6247.92s]  Guy Fireeye.
[6247.92s -> 6255.47s]  No, no, that's all wrong.
[6255.47s -> 6257.47s]  This needs to be a dwarf.
[6257.47s -> 6259.47s]  No, but they need to take the dwarf and
[6259.47s -> 6261.47s]  stretch the dwarf out longer.
[6261.47s -> 6263.47s]  Have it be the only model in the game
[6263.47s -> 6265.47s]  that has a Gumby body.
[6265.47s -> 6267.47s]  Just stretch out the legs and the torso
[6267.47s -> 6274.51s]  and give him the goatee and the hair.
[6274.51s -> 6276.51s]  Oh, by the way,
[6276.51s -> 6278.51s]  see you guys in like probably a couple
[6278.51s -> 6280.51s]  times back. We're gonna get
[6280.51s -> 6282.51s]  new 2021-2022
[6282.51s -> 6284.51s]  Gumby. They're gonna bring it back.
[6284.51s -> 6287.90s]  You know that's up next.
[6287.90s -> 6289.90s]  I'll just stamp this.
[6289.90s -> 6291.90s]  It's definitely coming up next for the things
[6291.90s -> 6293.90s]  we're bringing back as a group.
[6293.90s -> 6298.90s]  Not me and you, but them.
[6298.90s -> 6300.90s]  Alright, what's your favorite?
[6304.90s -> 6309.70s]  The establishment, yep.
[6309.70s -> 6312.70s]  The establishment.
[6312.70s -> 6314.70s]  The Illuminati.
[6314.70s -> 6318.22s]  The TV Illuminati.
[6318.22s -> 6320.22s]  What do we bring back next?
[6320.22s -> 6322.22s]  How about...
[6322.22s -> 6324.22s]  Elmo. Wait, no, he's already here.
[6324.22s -> 6326.22s]  He's already here permanently.
[6326.22s -> 6329.42s]  Maybe...
[6329.42s -> 6334.80s]  What was that little bald kid's name?
[6334.80s -> 6340.37s]  Bring him back too.
[6340.37s -> 6345.94s]  Caillou.
[6345.94s -> 6352.72s]  Doesn't everybody hate Caillou?
[6352.72s -> 6354.96s]  I was under the assumption that Caillou was horrible.
[6354.96s -> 6356.96s]  And kids were like being
[6356.96s -> 6359.26s]  naughty and stuff after they watched Caillou.
[6359.26s -> 6362.34s]  Am I making that up?
[6362.34s -> 6364.34s]  Feed her favorite
[6364.34s -> 6366.34s]  bug snack. I hope it's hot dogs.
[6366.34s -> 6372.48s]  I didn't pay attention.
[6385.04s -> 6387.04s]  Is that a hot dog arm?
[6387.04s -> 6389.04s]  Totally mysterious before he goes to bed
[6389.04s -> 6391.04s]  around 10 every night.
[6391.04s -> 6393.04s]  I want you to find out
[6393.04s -> 6395.04s]  what he's up to. And tell me.
[6395.04s -> 6397.04s]  If you don't want to wait around
[6397.04s -> 6399.04s]  you can always just take a nap until it's time.
[6399.04s -> 6401.04s]  Wait, you can sleep?
[6401.04s -> 6403.22s]  Okay, find out what Wampus does between
[6403.22s -> 6405.22s]  10 PM and 1 AM.
[6405.22s -> 6408.29s]  I didn't know you could sleep. Alright.
[6408.29s -> 6410.29s]  Between 10 PM and 1 AM we're gonna
[6410.29s -> 6412.98s]  find out what Wampus is doing.
[6412.98s -> 6414.98s]  Okay, sleep until
[6414.98s -> 6419.44s]  5 PM.
[6419.44s -> 6421.44s]  Watch? Oh, it's down the lower left. Okay. Between
[6421.44s -> 6423.44s]  10 and 1. We're gonna go find
[6423.44s -> 6433.04s]  Wampus. Zerking off
[6433.04s -> 6440.98s]  for 3 hours.
[6440.98s -> 6442.98s]  I love how you guys have found this great
[6442.98s -> 6444.98s]  way. And I'll be honest, me too.
[6444.98s -> 6446.98s]  Of like getting around the sensors.
[6446.98s -> 6448.98s]  I didn't say
[6448.98s -> 6450.98s]  that. I said zerking off. It's
[6450.98s -> 6453.60s]  different.
[6457.60s -> 6460.16s]  Dude, you look like a clown.
[6460.16s -> 6462.16s]  Alright, what do you want me to do?
[6464.16s -> 6466.16s]  Well, buddy.
[6466.16s -> 6468.16s]  Well, if you don't mind,
[6468.16s -> 6470.16s]  I'd love to fly it someday.
[6470.16s -> 6474.70s]  Okay, sure. Maybe one day
[6474.70s -> 6478.03s]  you'll fly this. Should we tell
[6478.03s -> 6480.03s]  him? Should we tell him?
[6480.03s -> 6482.03s]  That's not ever gonna happen. Alright, I got another thing
[6482.03s -> 6484.53s]  for you to eat. Look, I've got a
[6484.53s -> 6486.53s]  strawberry and I'm gonna put it on your
[6486.53s -> 6488.53s]  eye. Oh.
[6488.53s -> 6493.78s]  We're only gonna feed this guy
[6493.78s -> 6495.78s]  and make him like the top dog.
[6495.78s -> 6498.21s]  We're gonna make this guy the alpha.
[6498.21s -> 6503.57s]  Ooh, plant!
[6503.57s -> 6505.57s]  Okay. Pick a bug snack
[6505.57s -> 6507.57s]  to plant. Oh, shit.
[6507.57s -> 6510.26s]  We shouldn't have. Alright.
[6510.26s -> 6512.56s]  I mean, I'll remember where this is.
[6512.56s -> 6518.26s]  But I need to spy on this guy between, alright.
[6518.26s -> 6523.82s]  We need to wait till 10 PM.
[6523.82s -> 6525.82s]  Okay, he loves
[6525.82s -> 6531.71s]  the green guy. How much is it?
[6531.71s -> 6533.71s]  Six. Shit, I got here really early.
[6533.71s -> 6539.39s]  Just sleep.
[6539.39s -> 6544.83s]  No, I can't. How long would it take
[6544.83s -> 6546.83s]  for you to read the entire Bible?
[6546.83s -> 6549.76s]  Um, that's probably a pretty long
[6549.76s -> 6552.90s]  time. Probably
[6552.90s -> 6555.07s]  a few, at least a few days.
[6555.07s -> 6558.91s]  I can't, I have trouble
[6558.91s -> 6560.91s]  I can't read the Bible. It's just, the way
[6560.91s -> 6562.91s]  that it's worded and the way that it's
[6562.91s -> 6564.91s]  spread out and the paragraphing and
[6564.91s -> 6566.91s]  I can't follow it. It just feels like somebody's
[6566.91s -> 6568.91s]  speaking at me while I
[6568.91s -> 6570.91s]  have my ears covered. You know what I mean? It's like I'm kind of
[6570.91s -> 6572.91s]  hearing what you're saying but I don't get it. I can't comprehend
[6572.91s -> 6583.90s]  it. I'm gonna read a
[6583.90s -> 6587.94s]  kid's Bible. No, of that
[6587.94s -> 6590.67s]  kids edition?
[6590.67s -> 6599.18s]  Kids edition.
[6599.18s -> 6601.74s]  Read the Bible
[6601.74s -> 6608.91s]  Manga. Bible picture
[6608.91s -> 6613.52s]  book. Why are you guys on the Bible
[6613.52s -> 6615.89s]  right now? What about you here?
[6615.89s -> 6624.00s]  Alright, it's 8pm. I'm
[6624.00s -> 6630.14s]  gonna follow this guy. Read the
[6630.14s -> 6632.14s]  Minecraft Bible. Is this a Minecraft
[6632.14s -> 6641.23s]  Bible? Lego
[6641.23s -> 6644.61s]  Bible. Who's
[6644.61s -> 6651.01s]  that?
[6651.01s -> 6658.37s]  Fortnite Bible. Holy shit, I saw
[6658.37s -> 6660.37s]  the Lego Bible at Costco one time.
[6660.37s -> 6662.37s]  You made that up. That's a glory,
[6662.37s -> 6664.37s]  the best part about the internet. You can just write
[6664.37s -> 6666.37s]  anything and just say it's real.
[6666.37s -> 6681.58s]  8.30. It's not real.
[6681.58s -> 6683.58s]  It's not real. There's no Lego Bible.
[6683.58s -> 6686.59s]  It wouldn't surprise me though because it's
[6686.59s -> 6695.42s]  Lego everything. Brick
[6695.42s -> 6697.42s]  Testament. Yeah, but I think
[6697.42s -> 6715.47s]  that- shh, quiet.
[6715.47s -> 6731.28s]  What you doing? It's 9.30.
[6731.28s -> 6736.34s]  It's too early. Don't go
[6736.34s -> 6742.03s]  in. Oh shit, okay. 9.45.
[6742.03s -> 6744.03s]  9.50.
[6744.03s -> 6747.23s]  He's getting ready to do
[6747.23s -> 6749.86s]  something. He's getting ready
[6749.86s -> 6751.86s]  to do something. I'm not gonna look at him anymore.
[6751.86s -> 6754.10s]  I'm not gonna look at him anymore.
[6754.10s -> 6756.10s]  I'm not gonna look at him anymore through the window until 10.
[6756.10s -> 6758.27s]  Okay, it's 10. What does it do?
[6758.27s -> 6760.27s]  I can't look through this window from this
[6760.27s -> 6762.27s]  perspective. I can't.
[6762.27s -> 6764.27s]  I just can't do it. What is he doing?
[6764.27s -> 6772.70s]  What are you doing?
[6772.70s -> 6775.90s]  What is he doing?
[6794.54s -> 6798.45s]  Alright, we got it.
[6798.45s -> 6801.89s]  Hey.
[6805.89s -> 6807.89s]  Talk to him through his window that I've been spying
[6807.89s -> 6810.45s]  on him through.
[6810.45s -> 6817.23s]  Alright, let's go report back.
[6817.23s -> 6827.09s]  I need a root and a fruit. Why are you doing
[6827.09s -> 6829.71s]  all this shit for her?
[6829.71s -> 6831.71s]  Because it's a quest and you get experience.
[6831.71s -> 6836.26s]  Plus, we're gonna double cross this lady.
[6847.06s -> 6849.06s]  Ugh,
[6849.06s -> 6851.06s]  Snaxburg sounds way more fun than sitting around
[6851.06s -> 6853.06s]  in this cave. I thought it
[6853.06s -> 6855.06s]  would be relaxing, but it's totes boring.
[6855.06s -> 6857.06s]  Like boring like playing
[6857.06s -> 6859.06s]  solitaire by yourself and you've been
[6859.06s -> 6861.06s]  on the floor? Oh, sorry. I've got a little bit
[6861.06s -> 6863.06s]  my chest is a little itchy.
[6865.06s -> 6873.76s]  Okay. I have to plant a root.
[6873.76s -> 6875.94s]  Alright, we gotta get some bugs.
[6875.94s -> 6877.94s]  Plant a root and plant a fruit.
[6877.94s -> 6879.94s]  What is that? That's a diet
[6879.94s -> 6881.94s]  coke. That's a floating diet coke.
[6881.94s -> 6884.11s]  That's a Dr. Sody.
[6884.11s -> 6886.11s]  Okay, I have to have Dr. Sody.
[6886.11s -> 6888.11s]  There's no way I don't get Dr.
[6888.11s -> 6890.11s]  Sody. Are you kidding me?
[6890.11s -> 6896.38s]  Aww, Dr. Sody!
[6896.38s -> 6902.06s]  Yes!
[6902.06s -> 6905.78s]  Awesome. Alright, who gets
[6905.78s -> 6909.36s]  to drink Dr. Sody?
[6909.36s -> 6911.36s]  We need a fruit though. Alright, I need a
[6911.36s -> 6913.36s]  strawberry and what's a root?
[6913.36s -> 6916.11s]  This is all fast food. This is the fast food
[6916.11s -> 6918.54s]  section. I need a
[6918.54s -> 6921.30s]  carrot. Carrot and a
[6921.30s -> 6923.30s]  Alright, we gotta go back to the other area. This is the fast food
[6923.30s -> 6932.77s]  area. French fries are not a root.
[6932.77s -> 6940.83s]  It's a potato.
[6940.83s -> 6943.14s]  That's like saying pizza is tomato.
[6943.14s -> 6947.30s]  No, that's not a tomato.
[6947.30s -> 6951.97s]  Tomato is part of it.
[6951.97s -> 6953.97s]  Pizza's not a vegetable because there's tomato on it.
[6953.97s -> 6955.97s]  They tried that like ten years ago. I remember.
[6955.97s -> 6967.55s]  Who should we give this to?
[6967.55s -> 6973.23s]  Who are you to decide?
[6973.23s -> 6977.82s]  Um, I don't know. I just did.
[6977.82s -> 6979.82s]  Alright, soda. You want the soda?
[6979.82s -> 6981.82s]  You. Ramble.
[6981.82s -> 6983.82s]  Wake up.
[6983.82s -> 6985.82s]  Let's turn this guy into a Dr. Pepper.
[6985.82s -> 6987.82s]  No, get over here. Eat.
[6987.82s -> 6990.32s]  Okay. Oh, wait. No, no, no. You don't
[6990.32s -> 6992.32s]  eat these animals, right? Or these bugs.
[6992.32s -> 6994.32s]  Never done an interview before.
[6994.32s -> 6997.58s]  How's it work?
[6997.58s -> 6999.58s]  Is it soda? I guess it has
[6999.58s -> 7001.58s]  eyes. Does it make it alive?
[7001.58s -> 7006.13s]  Okay. Who are you?
[7006.13s -> 7010.80s]  Heard Lizbert was gathering up some grumps
[7010.80s -> 7014.26s]  to be part of her new family. Use one
[7014.26s -> 7016.26s]  of those. Swimming and crawling. Alright, yeah.
[7016.26s -> 7018.26s]  Who are you though?
[7018.26s -> 7020.26s]  Ramble? Giggle funny. I look after
[7020.26s -> 7022.26s]  all the bugsnacks in town and make sure they don't
[7022.26s -> 7026.10s]  wander off. You don't have a family?
[7026.10s -> 7028.53s]  I did. When they
[7028.53s -> 7032.56s]  we talk about something else.
[7032.56s -> 7036.21s]  Well, they're just the cutest little
[7036.21s -> 7038.21s]  things, aren't they? I don't
[7038.21s -> 7040.21s]  understand how anybody could look into their
[7040.21s -> 7042.21s]  googly little eyes and want to eat them.
[7042.21s -> 7045.60s]  But, yeah,
[7045.60s -> 7048.16s]  everybody does eat them though.
[7048.16s -> 7050.59s]  Well, they don't eat none and that's what counts.
[7050.59s -> 7053.60s]  Why did you leave?
[7053.60s -> 7055.90s]  Liz, to bring in snacks, everybody got
[7055.90s -> 7058.91s]  mighty hunted. Untreated my barn
[7058.91s -> 7060.91s]  like a grocery store.
[7060.91s -> 7062.91s]  I held him off for a while,
[7062.91s -> 7065.34s]  but I should have known Wambus never quits.
[7065.34s -> 7069.36s]  Next
[7069.36s -> 7071.36s]  night I woke up to him throwing my snacks into a sack.
[7071.36s -> 7075.07s]  And I let the rest go free.
[7075.07s -> 7077.07s]  Broke my heart,
[7077.07s -> 7079.07s]  but it's better than them getting eaten.
[7079.07s -> 7081.07s]  I left that night for the beach
[7081.07s -> 7083.07s]  and started rebuilding my family.
[7083.07s -> 7085.07s]  The Siege of the Barn.
[7085.07s -> 7090.51s]  The eagle's a lot,
[7090.51s -> 7093.07s]  but she's got a good heart.
[7093.07s -> 7095.07s]  If she really likes me, she'll learn to love
[7095.07s -> 7097.07s]  bugsnacks the way I do.
[7097.07s -> 7099.82s]  Alright, what about Lizbert?
[7099.82s -> 7102.45s]  Where did she go?
[7112.69s -> 7115.12s]  Aww.
[7115.12s -> 7117.12s]  Bugtacks?
[7117.12s -> 7119.12s]  Alright, but what happened to Lizbert?
[7140.24s -> 7142.24s]  Did you sleepwalk kill Lizbert?
[7142.24s -> 7144.24s]  You're getting really defensive when we bring up Lizbert.
[7144.24s -> 7146.86s]  You don't eat bugsnacks,
[7146.86s -> 7148.86s]  but that doesn't mean you don't eat
[7148.86s -> 7151.81s]  puppet humans.
[7151.81s -> 7153.81s]  Oh, a key.
[7153.81s -> 7162.38s]  Oh, what?
[7162.38s -> 7168.72s]  Oh.
[7168.72s -> 7170.72s]  Okay, I got it. Oh.
[7170.72s -> 7174.56s]  Oh, I got it.
[7174.56s -> 7176.86s]  What happened?
[7176.86s -> 7182.30s]  Philbo wants to talk to you.
[7182.30s -> 7185.50s]  I'm here.
[7185.50s -> 7187.50s]  What can I do for you, Philbert?
[7187.50s -> 7189.81s]  Oh, you have something to tell me.
[7189.81s -> 7194.54s]  Among us stream when?
[7194.54s -> 7197.68s]  I've never.
[7197.68s -> 7199.68s]  I will never play that game on stream.
[7199.68s -> 7201.68s]  Not one time.
[7203.68s -> 7205.68s]  I plan on trying it tomorrow.
[7205.68s -> 7207.68s]  Alright, donate six bugsnacks
[7207.68s -> 7209.68s]  to the ranch.
[7209.68s -> 7211.68s]  I already have a soda snack.
[7211.68s -> 7213.68s]  Wait, do you want this? Here, drink this.
[7213.68s -> 7215.68s]  Okay.
[7215.68s -> 7217.98s]  Okay.
[7217.98s -> 7219.98s]  Okay.
[7219.98s -> 7221.98s]  Okay.
[7221.98s -> 7223.98s]  Wait, do you want this? Here, drink this.
[7223.98s -> 7227.49s]  Look what I got.
[7227.49s -> 7232.29s]  Try that.
[7232.29s -> 7234.53s]  A straw mustache.
[7234.53s -> 7241.44s]  Cool.
[7241.44s -> 7243.94s]  Practice your lying.
[7243.94s -> 7245.94s]  Do I really need to do that?
[7245.94s -> 7248.24s]  I lie to you guys literally every single day.
[7248.24s -> 7251.44s]  Do I need to practice?
[7257.44s -> 7259.44s]  Guys,
[7259.44s -> 7261.87s]  my first name is Dan.
[7261.87s -> 7263.87s]  I'm like, can we be real about this?
[7263.87s -> 7270.46s]  Okay, let's go.
[7270.46s -> 7280.05s]  Dance party.
[7282.05s -> 7284.05s]  Somebody go over there and start talking to him.
[7284.05s -> 7286.05s]  Somebody go over there and start talking to him so he stops.
[7286.05s -> 7288.05s]  Somebody just go talk to him so he stops.
[7288.05s -> 7290.05s]  Hey, man, what's up?
[7290.05s -> 7292.05s]  Come over here, I gotta talk to you.
[7294.05s -> 7298.85s]  Wait, I only made like two friends.
[7298.85s -> 7303.89s]  The farmer,
[7303.89s -> 7306.32s]  the serial killer,
[7306.32s -> 7308.69s]  the weirdo, and the mean girl.
[7308.69s -> 7311.25s]  This is quite the Wizard of Oz group.
[7311.25s -> 7318.98s]  Oh, this is disgusting.
[7318.98s -> 7322.62s]  I don't know why, I just felt like I was in VR.
[7322.62s -> 7324.93s]  Oh, look, I picked up this cup.
[7324.93s -> 7326.93s]  Shake it around, throw it. Ooh, VR.
[7329.17s -> 7331.79s]  Okay, what are we doing?
[7333.79s -> 7335.79s]  Some kind of suicide squad.
[7337.79s -> 7339.79s]  Yeah, we all die in the first two minutes of the movie.
[7349.22s -> 7351.46s]  How's the butt juice?
[7351.46s -> 7353.46s]  Isn't this just water?
[7353.46s -> 7355.46s]  Well, uh, it's bug
[7355.46s -> 7357.46s]  infused.
[7357.46s -> 7359.46s]  Why do I feel like we're gonna get a South Park Stan
[7359.46s -> 7361.46s]  and Wendy puking his mouth scenario?
[7361.46s -> 7366.94s]  Remember they used to do that?
[7366.94s -> 7368.94s]  Every time Stan talked to Wendy,
[7368.94s -> 7370.94s]  he puked in her
[7370.94s -> 7376.06s]  fucking face.
[7376.06s -> 7378.06s]  They did it for so long, too.
[7378.06s -> 7382.35s]  Did they give up doing that?
[7382.35s -> 7384.35s]  That was a thing they did for 10 to 15 straight years.
[7384.35s -> 7386.35s]  Do they still do that?
[7386.35s -> 7391.58s]  Yes, they stopped.
[7391.58s -> 7393.58s]  They stopped doing it when they started dating.
[7393.58s -> 7400.88s]  Oh, that show is
[7400.88s -> 7407.92s]  insane.
[7415.82s -> 7417.82s]  They stopped it in like 2004.
[7426.32s -> 7428.32s]  South Park games?
[7428.32s -> 7430.32s]  It was on the website,
[7430.32s -> 7432.32s]  those little flash games, right?
[7435.07s -> 7440.70s]  Who else should I talk to?
[7440.70s -> 7442.70s]  Alright, I didn't talk to the farmer.
[7442.70s -> 7456.59s]  Can I change the radio? This party sucks.
[7456.59s -> 7463.57s]  This is the kind of party that you show up to
[7463.57s -> 7465.57s]  and you realize what's going on
[7465.57s -> 7469.34s]  and you
[7469.34s -> 7471.71s]  grab like a water
[7471.71s -> 7473.71s]  and you're like, yeah, I'll take a water.
[7473.71s -> 7478.70s]  This is a water party.
[7478.70s -> 7480.70s]  I'll be dipping out in probably 40 minutes.
[7480.70s -> 7487.30s]  Maybe an hour.
[7487.30s -> 7489.73s]  Yeah, I've already mingled.
[7489.73s -> 7492.80s]  Now what?
[7507.42s -> 7510.61s]  Oh, that's unfortunate.
[7518.74s -> 7520.74s]  Hey, bro.
[7520.74s -> 7522.74s]  You've been drinking water, right?
[7522.74s -> 7524.74s]  Yeah, yeah, I've been drinking water.
[7524.74s -> 7526.74s]  Yeah, I'm just
[7526.74s -> 7528.74s]  checking to see if we're on the same page.
[7551.76s -> 7553.76s]  Is somebody
[7553.76s -> 7555.76s]  reacting to my ass? I don't know.
[7555.76s -> 7560.11s]  Wrong link.
[7560.11s -> 7562.29s]  It was the wrong link.
[7562.29s -> 7568.69s]  I feel like it wasn't.
[7568.69s -> 7580.51s]  This one, right?
[7580.51s -> 7586.66s]  Links are getting obliterated.
[7586.66s -> 7589.79s]  No, not that one.
[7589.79s -> 7591.79s]  How is it wrong?
[7591.79s -> 7594.29s]  It's like being spammed.
[7594.29s -> 7599.28s]  There's no such thing as a wrong link.
[7599.28s -> 7601.28s]  Okay, this is scary.
[7601.28s -> 7613.04s]  Is this the one?
[7613.04s -> 7616.05s]  Alright, I'm going to do an experiment.
[7616.05s -> 7618.80s]  Everybody quiet. Don't type.
[7618.80s -> 7627.25s]  I'm serious, like do not, just don't type at all.
[7627.25s -> 7629.25s]  Don't even do like the dot dot dots.
[7629.25s -> 7634.72s]  Nobody chat. Quiet.
[7634.72s -> 7658.02s]  Sit here. I want some new people to come in.
[7658.02s -> 7660.02s]  This is a 10k concurrent stream.
[7660.02s -> 7662.02s]  People are going to think this is
[7662.02s -> 7664.02s]  going to come, people are going to think this is like a
[7664.02s -> 7667.47s]  botted channel. This channel is going to get like reported.
[7667.47s -> 7670.42s]  Yeah, Twitch, this is like a botted channel
[7670.42s -> 7672.42s]  just with this like weird scary imposter
[7672.42s -> 7674.42s]  thing on this botted viewbot channel.
[7674.42s -> 7677.98s]  Shut it down.
[7677.98s -> 7684.96s]  I don't know who the fuck this guy is.
[7686.96s -> 7689.20s]  That joke is a month old.
[7691.89s -> 7693.89s]  Wait, somebody made that a month ago and I didn't see it?
[7697.89s -> 7699.89s]  Yo, bro.
[7708.88s -> 7711.82s]  You drinking water?
[7713.82s -> 7715.82s]  Okay, dude, just making sure we're on the same fucking page.
[7715.82s -> 7718.13s]  Don't act like you're in charge.
[7718.13s -> 7720.13s]  If you had the spine to lead us,
[7720.13s -> 7722.13s]  everybody would still be here.
[7722.13s -> 7724.13s]  Don't you mean, Trippany
[7724.13s -> 7726.13s]  would still be here?
[7726.13s -> 7728.13s]  Fine, all y'all gang up on me.
[7728.13s -> 7730.13s]  Don't make me wrong.
[7730.13s -> 7732.13s]  You all want Trippany back so bad?
[7732.13s -> 7734.13s]  Go find her yourself.
[7734.13s -> 7738.80s]  Yo, bro, you want to get out of here?
[7738.80s -> 7740.98s]  Let's get the fuck out of here.
[7740.98s -> 7742.98s]  This party, I knew it, it was a bad party.
[7753.12s -> 7755.12s]  Yeah, skimmy.
[7755.12s -> 7757.12s]  You sure have had quite a few though.
[7757.12s -> 7759.30s]  Wow.
[7761.30s -> 7763.30s]  A whole strabby.
[7765.30s -> 7767.30s]  It is drugs.
[7769.30s -> 7771.30s]  Wait, food poisoning?
[7791.23s -> 7793.66s]  Poisoned.
[7793.66s -> 7798.27s]  Get away from me, give me some space.
[7800.27s -> 7807.04s]  What the hell?
[7807.04s -> 7810.88s]  Philbo, what the heck?
[7812.88s -> 7814.88s]  Alright, I need to donate six snacks.
[7814.88s -> 7816.88s]  It's Jeff from American Dead.
[7832.99s -> 7834.99s]  It's Jeff.
[7834.99s -> 7836.99s]  Have it, Jeff.
[7836.99s -> 7840.51s]  Shut up.
[7840.51s -> 7842.51s]  Mr. S.
[7842.51s -> 7844.51s]  Jeff, you're an idiot, and you're a complete embarrassment to this family.
[7849.63s -> 7855.97s]  Look down.
[7855.97s -> 7859.04s]  Roger, do Roger.
[7859.04s -> 7861.04s]  Stan, I'm having some trouble with this, Stan.
[7863.04s -> 7865.04s]  Yeah, I'm gonna have to need you to get out of here, Stan.
[7867.04s -> 7870.50s]  Give me another one.
[7870.50s -> 7872.50s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[7872.50s -> 7879.98s]  Alright, alright.
[7879.98s -> 7881.98s]  Go, go, go.
[7881.98s -> 7884.35s]  The fish?
[7884.35s -> 7886.59s]  My name is Klaus, and I'm stuck in a bowl.
[7886.59s -> 7888.59s]  Patrick Stewart.
[7888.59s -> 7890.59s]  I'm Patrick Stewart, and I think that you deserve to be fired.
[7890.59s -> 7892.59s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[7892.59s -> 7898.86s]  Barney.
[7898.86s -> 7900.86s]  I don't know, Barney from what?
[7900.86s -> 7902.86s]  Barney the dinosaur?
[7902.86s -> 7904.86s]  It's me, Barney.
[7904.86s -> 7906.86s]  Go, go, go, go.
[7906.86s -> 7914.08s]  Obama.
[7914.08s -> 7916.08s]  I think that we all need to come together.
[7916.08s -> 7918.08s]  To take care of this.
[7918.08s -> 7920.08s]  I will take care of that.
[7920.08s -> 7922.08s]  Don't worry about that.
[7922.08s -> 7930.26s]  Go, go, anymore.
[7930.26s -> 7932.26s]  Framer.
[7932.26s -> 7934.69s]  I'm gonna spell that.
[7934.69s -> 7938.46s]  Squidward.
[7938.46s -> 7940.46s]  Luigi.
[7940.46s -> 7944.22s]  Joe Biden.
[7944.22s -> 7946.83s]  Now look, here's the deal.
[7946.83s -> 7948.83s]  We are going to solve America.
[7948.83s -> 7950.83s]  Give me another one.
[7950.83s -> 7952.83s]  Not that one, not that one.
[7952.83s -> 7956.22s]  Tingle.
[7956.22s -> 7958.22s]  I've never played Zelda, I don't know what he sounds like.
[7958.22s -> 7960.22s]  Next one.
[7960.22s -> 7962.22s]  Marge.
[7962.22s -> 7965.74s]  Hercules.
[7965.74s -> 7967.74s]  Costanza.
[7967.74s -> 7969.74s]  Jerry.
[7969.74s -> 7972.94s]  Get going crazy here.
[7972.94s -> 7975.12s]  Meatwad.
[7975.12s -> 7977.12s]  I don't want to know, I just got away from it.
[7977.12s -> 7979.12s]  Homer.
[7979.12s -> 7981.12s]  It's me, Homer.
[7981.12s -> 7983.36s]  Shrek.
[7983.36s -> 7985.36s]  It's me, Shrek.
[7985.36s -> 7987.66s]  Cosmo and Wanda.
[7987.66s -> 7989.66s]  Okay, here's Cosmo.
[7989.66s -> 7991.90s]  Wanda.
[7991.90s -> 7994.34s]  Sans.
[7994.34s -> 7996.77s]  Donkey Kong.
[7996.77s -> 8002.53s]  Snake.
[8002.53s -> 8005.15s]  Al Gore.
[8005.15s -> 8007.15s]  The planet is under attack.
[8007.15s -> 8010.93s]  Kirby.
[8010.93s -> 8016.42s]  Trump.
[8016.42s -> 8018.42s]  Okay.
[8018.42s -> 8020.42s]  I didn't do anything wrong.
[8020.42s -> 8022.72s]  It's a fake media.
[8022.72s -> 8024.72s]  Megamind.
[8024.72s -> 8028.88s]  I don't know.
[8028.88s -> 8037.97s]  Dana White?
[8037.97s -> 8039.97s]  Like from UFC?
[8039.97s -> 8043.49s]  It's the tale of the tape.
[8043.49s -> 8045.49s]  We've got these two fighters.
[8045.49s -> 8047.49s]  Why do you want me to do a Dana White impression?
[8047.49s -> 8050.05s]  I don't get it, that doesn't make any sense.
[8050.05s -> 8057.86s]  It's just a normal guy talking.
[8057.86s -> 8060.35s]  Macho Man, got it.
[8060.35s -> 8062.35s]  I just want to...
[8062.35s -> 8064.78s]  Hold on, I'll get it.
[8064.78s -> 8066.78s]  Can you hear anything we're talking about, Minji?
[8068.78s -> 8070.78s]  I just want to say the cream of the crop.
[8070.78s -> 8072.78s]  Next.
[8072.78s -> 8074.78s]  Dr. Evil.
[8076.78s -> 8080.62s]  Alex Jones.
[8084.62s -> 8087.87s]  Mr. Krabs.
[8089.87s -> 8092.37s]  Kanye.
[8092.37s -> 8094.37s]  Hey!
[8094.37s -> 8096.37s]  I'm moving, I'm moving, I'm moving.
[8098.37s -> 8102.34s]  Joe Rogan.
[8102.34s -> 8106.42s]  Yeah.
[8106.42s -> 8110.11s]  Right, man.
[8110.11s -> 8113.31s]  Yeah.
[8113.31s -> 8115.31s]  Eric Cartman.
[8115.31s -> 8117.31s]  My name's Eric Cartman, I don't like you.
[8117.31s -> 8119.31s]  And hey, Kenny.
[8119.31s -> 8122.13s]  No, Kenny.
[8122.13s -> 8125.26s]  Wombus.
[8125.26s -> 8127.26s]  I only came here for Triffy.
[8127.26s -> 8129.26s]  Sometimes I wonder if she'd do the same for me.
[8135.98s -> 8138.67s]  Popeye.
[8138.67s -> 8140.67s]  Well, I am a cellular man.
[8140.67s -> 8142.67s]  I'm a cellular man.
[8145.23s -> 8147.23s]  The Medic.
[8147.23s -> 8149.54s]  Okay, people are going to leave, I have to stop.
[8149.54s -> 8156.77s]  Let's play the game.
[8156.77s -> 8159.97s]  This dude's going off.
[8159.97s -> 8164.58s]  You're dropping viewers.
[8164.58s -> 8166.58s]  Hey, we'll see you next week.
[8166.58s -> 8168.58s]  When they decide to come back after they're...
[8168.58s -> 8170.82s]  The ultimate small doses streamer.
[8170.82s -> 8174.91s]  Yeah, I peek in from time to time.
[8174.91s -> 8176.91s]  I have small doses, I can handle them.
[8176.91s -> 8182.54s]  All right, I gotta go find things to plant here.
[8182.54s -> 8189.01s]  Do Mr. Satan.
[8189.01s -> 8191.01s]  You guys already know my Mr. Satan.
[8191.01s -> 8193.01s]  I don't have to do it again.
[8193.01s -> 8195.01s]  Okay, excuse me.
[8195.01s -> 8197.01s]  You think you're not the strongest man in the world?
[8197.01s -> 8199.01s]  I'm the strongest man in the world, Goku.
[8199.01s -> 8201.01s]  And I'll take you on in a fight one on one.
[8201.01s -> 8203.01s]  You want to fight me one on one, Goku?
[8203.01s -> 8205.01s]  Come on at me.
[8205.01s -> 8207.01s]  Send him to hell.
[8207.01s -> 8216.29s]  Send who to hell?
[8216.29s -> 8219.68s]  I am not even playing the game.
[8219.68s -> 8221.68s]  I'm just stuck in the mirror.
[8221.68s -> 8223.68s]  This is what I do in the mirror.
[8223.68s -> 8225.68s]  I already get stuck like this
[8225.68s -> 8227.68s]  two or three times a day.
[8227.68s -> 8230.75s]  You put me in front of a mirror, I'm going to see myself
[8230.75s -> 8232.75s]  and go, oh, it's a person. Who's that?
[8232.75s -> 8234.75s]  Goku.
[8234.75s -> 8236.75s]  Don't put me in front of a mirror. I get trapped.
[8236.75s -> 8246.67s]  What do I do?
[8246.67s -> 8260.54s]  I need vegetables.
[8260.54s -> 8262.54s]  Wait, I can just get bugs. Let's get bugs.
[8262.54s -> 8264.54s]  All right, check this out.
[8264.54s -> 8270.93s]  I'm going to have you.
[8270.93s -> 8272.93s]  Hey, don't do that shit.
[8272.93s -> 8286.05s]  I'm going to donate six bugs to the ranch.
[8286.05s -> 8288.05s]  I'll just get them from here.
[8288.05s -> 8290.93s]  Do I not have a tool
[8290.93s -> 8292.93s]  that I can go in the air with?
[8292.93s -> 8295.62s]  I feel like it's been a while.
[8295.62s -> 8297.92s]  All right, let's get this bug. Ketchup bug.
[8297.92s -> 8301.23s]  I'll put that down there.
[8301.23s -> 8303.23s]  Get some ketchup, please. Thank you.
[8303.23s -> 8309.62s]  Let's get them. Do G-men and I'll...
[8309.62s -> 8311.62s]  Wait, do G-men and I'll give 100,000 subs.
[8311.62s -> 8314.05s]  Uh...
[8314.05s -> 8316.05s]  Mr. Freeman.
[8316.05s -> 8318.05s]  That's not right. That's the scientist.
[8318.05s -> 8320.05s]  Let me do it again.
[8320.05s -> 8322.05s]  The thing about that, Gordon,
[8322.05s -> 8324.05s]  you abandoned
[8324.05s -> 8326.05s]  the wrong place at the right time.
[8326.05s -> 8328.05s]  You could make all
[8328.05s -> 8330.05s]  the difference.
[8330.05s -> 8332.93s]  Open the briefcase, Gordon.
[8332.93s -> 8336.06s]  100,000 subs. Thank you.
[8336.06s -> 8347.71s]  You know, this is just
[8347.71s -> 8349.71s]  what I think would happen
[8349.71s -> 8351.71s]  when the really, really hyperactive
[8351.71s -> 8353.71s]  kid in Show and Tell didn't bring
[8353.71s -> 8355.71s]  anything to Show and Tell, and the teacher
[8355.71s -> 8357.71s]  just knows he's fucking out of
[8357.71s -> 8359.71s]  his mind. So they just go, you know
[8359.71s -> 8361.71s]  what? Okay, go ahead.
[8361.71s -> 8363.71s]  And I brought my impressions today.
[8363.71s -> 8366.21s]  And everyone just has to put up
[8366.21s -> 8368.21s]  with this for the five to ten
[8368.21s -> 8374.48s]  minutes that happens. What do you
[8374.48s -> 8376.48s]  like? Maybe I can lure you over with some
[8376.48s -> 8379.04s]  candy. Right?
[8379.04s -> 8381.34s]  Because it's a candy fly, and there's candy
[8381.34s -> 8383.52s]  here. Does the
[8383.52s -> 8385.52s]  candy fly like candy?
[8385.52s -> 8392.67s]  That would make sense, right?
[8392.67s -> 8394.98s]  What do you like, though? Don't be a
[8394.98s -> 8397.86s]  sucker. What do you like? You don't have
[8397.86s -> 8400.61s]  any likes or dislikes.
[8400.61s -> 8404.90s]  Come on. Hey, Phallus extends to the five
[8404.90s -> 8406.90s]  community subs. A little short of 100,000,
[8406.90s -> 8408.90s]  but, you know, we make bets here that we don't go through
[8408.90s -> 8411.46s]  with. Like me?
[8411.46s -> 8414.34s]  Like you? I need two hamburgers
[8414.34s -> 8417.22s]  to fight each other. I can do that.
[8417.22s -> 8419.39s]  Come here.
[8419.39s -> 8422.26s]  Hamburger. You.
[8422.26s -> 8431.46s]  Follow. Oh, alright, come on.
[8431.46s -> 8433.89s]  Come on, Bunger.
[8433.89s -> 8436.26s]  Bunger! Nice sick, nice sick,
[8436.26s -> 8439.46s]  sick, sick, nice sick.
[8439.46s -> 8446.24s]  Any more Bungers? You owe us the dump
[8446.24s -> 8451.42s]  truck emote. I don't know, I don't.
[8451.42s -> 8453.66s]  Maybe eventually you'll get it if you behave.
[8453.66s -> 8459.94s]  Well, I have four. Let me just go
[8459.94s -> 8468.26s]  back and donate these.
[8468.26s -> 8470.69s]  You told us three new emotes.
[8470.69s -> 8472.69s]  Yeah, like within the next seven to ten days,
[8472.69s -> 8475.38s]  it's been like five. I got plenty
[8475.38s -> 8491.06s]  of time. Meanyworm.
[8491.06s -> 8493.36s]  Oh, wait, here's a fruit.
[8493.36s -> 8496.16s]  Get back there, because then I can plant
[8496.16s -> 8498.16s]  the fruit and then I need a carrot.
[8498.16s -> 8500.46s]  Can I actually
[8500.46s -> 8505.33s]  plant the french fries? Does that not work?
[8505.33s -> 8509.04s]  Four part dump truck ass
[8509.04s -> 8511.79s]  emote. I'm gonna get kicked off
[8511.79s -> 8518.19s]  a twitch. Baku tail, thanks
[8518.19s -> 8520.19s]  to the five. No, six community subs, actually.
[8520.19s -> 8526.21s]  I read that wrong.
[8526.21s -> 8528.21s]  I don't think I've even been to Flavor Falls.
[8528.21s -> 8531.79s]  Got that. Yeah, that's a good olive.
[8531.79s -> 8536.40s]  Holy shit. What
[8536.40s -> 8538.40s]  the hell is that? It's a sub sandwich?
[8538.40s -> 8543.78s]  That's my favorite.
[8543.78s -> 8546.08s]  I love them. How do
[8546.08s -> 8548.08s]  I get a sandwich bug thing?
[8548.08s -> 8550.51s]  How do I get the Super Bowl party
[8550.51s -> 8554.22s]  sandwich? What is that?
[8554.22s -> 8558.50s]  A veggie bit. No,
[8558.50s -> 8560.50s]  you. A white rootle. Oh,
[8560.50s -> 8562.99s]  shit. Alright, hold on. I have to
[8562.99s -> 8567.47s]  release some of these. I have too many
[8567.47s -> 8571.57s]  french fries. Release. Hey.
[8571.57s -> 8577.38s]  Release you. Go to the farm.
[8577.38s -> 8579.81s]  Yeah, I want to catch this
[8579.81s -> 8581.81s]  one, because that's a veggie.
[8581.81s -> 8593.25s]  This game is really cute.
[8593.25s -> 8595.25s]  There's my vegetable. There's my
[8595.25s -> 8598.83s]  loves.
[8598.83s -> 8602.03s]  Speeds along crashing into things.
[8602.03s -> 8604.03s]  It won't slow down until it's broken up.
[8604.03s -> 8607.74s]  What is it? Love? Orange
[8607.74s -> 8614.14s]  juice? I'll come back for you.
[8614.14s -> 8619.57s]  Is that a pretzel?
[8619.57s -> 8621.57s]  What is it? Tasty, twisty snack
[8621.57s -> 8623.57s]  pod? What?
[8623.57s -> 8627.26s]  Alright, get rid of the french fries.
[8627.26s -> 8629.26s]  Another ten community subs.
[8629.26s -> 8633.36s]  It's just a bag of chips, but it's
[8633.36s -> 8636.30s]  alive. What?
[8636.30s -> 8640.58s]  Uh, Flutter.
[8640.58s -> 8643.52s]  Looter, thanks for the ten community subs.
[8643.52s -> 8645.89s]  Alright, I gotta deliver these. I missed other subs,
[8645.89s -> 8652.86s]  did I? Oh, shit, we had a lot.
[8652.86s -> 8654.86s]  Ah, we did, right. Felsix gave five.
[8654.86s -> 8658.70s]  Jubelube
[8658.70s -> 8660.70s]  Tube gave five.
[8660.70s -> 8663.65s]  And then Captain Nemo gave a hundred bucks.
[8663.65s -> 8665.65s]  Thanks for the ten thousand bits.
[8665.65s -> 8667.65s]  This is huge money today. There's been like
[8667.65s -> 8669.65s]  three or four of these.
[8669.65s -> 8672.85s]  Too much money. And Captain Nemo
[8672.85s -> 8674.85s]  says dump truck emote tomorrow,
[8674.85s -> 8676.85s]  or I will freeze this card before it goes
[8676.85s -> 8678.85s]  through. Uh, well, I don't...
[8678.85s -> 8682.30s]  Well, you're gonna be getting...
[8682.30s -> 8685.31s]  You're gonna be hearing from your bank. Cause I don't think
[8685.31s -> 8697.73s]  it's gonna be here tomorrow.
[8697.73s -> 8700.42s]  I'm gonna freeze my card.
[8700.42s -> 8702.42s]  Yes, this is uh, this is bank.
[8702.42s -> 8704.91s]  I'm gonna help you. I'd like to
[8704.91s -> 8706.91s]  freeze my credit card. I'd like to report a
[8706.91s -> 8708.91s]  freeze of the purchase that just happened.
[8708.91s -> 8711.15s]  And what purchase would that be?
[8711.15s -> 8713.33s]  A hundred dollars to an e-clown.
[8713.33s -> 8715.95s]  Oh, you didn't make that purchase?
[8715.95s -> 8718.77s]  No. You didn't, cause you confirmed it
[8718.77s -> 8720.94s]  twice. No, um,
[8720.94s -> 8723.31s]  I did, but he
[8723.31s -> 8725.31s]  said he wasn't gonna make a German ass
[8725.31s -> 8727.31s]  dump truck emote, so
[8727.31s -> 8731.60s]  I have to refund it. Okay.
[8731.60s -> 8733.60s]  Um, no.
[8733.60s -> 8736.99s]  I'm switching banks. I'm switching
[8736.99s -> 8738.99s]  banks. Bullshit, I'm switching banks.
[8738.99s -> 8749.41s]  Cool.
[8749.41s -> 8753.63s]  I planted the snacks.
[8759.14s -> 8761.14s]  He's destroying... No, I'm not.
[8761.14s -> 8764.59s]  Wait, I have some more stuff.
[8764.59s -> 8766.59s]  Alright, you eat. What about this pretzel snack pod?
[8770.18s -> 8773.95s]  I did this stuff in the lunchroom
[8773.95s -> 8776.19s]  in like the fourth grade.
[8776.19s -> 8778.19s]  You put the pretzel sticks in your mouth and you go
[8778.19s -> 8780.94s]  Alright, what about burger?
[8780.94s -> 8784.00s]  Nice.
[8784.00s -> 8790.21s]  Donate. Oh, right, you're right, right, right, right, right.
[8790.21s -> 8796.03s]  Donate you.
[8796.03s -> 8798.59s]  Donate Dr. Soda.
[8798.59s -> 8800.59s]  Oh, look! They actually come out and
[8800.59s -> 8805.84s]  play. I love this
[8805.84s -> 8810.19s]  guy. Is it weird that
[8810.19s -> 8812.19s]  this part of my brain sees this as
[8812.19s -> 8814.19s]  some weird post-apocalyptic
[8814.19s -> 8823.92s]  polluted earth shit?
[8823.92s -> 8831.02s]  This is gonna be real.
[8831.02s -> 8833.02s]  I don't like looking at that anymore. Alright.
[8833.02s -> 8835.02s]  I need four more snacks.
[8835.02s -> 8838.80s]  Hey, don't annoy me.
[8843.92s -> 8845.92s]  And we're voting you off the island.
[8845.92s -> 8847.92s]  What do you mean personal issues?
[8859.10s -> 8861.10s]  What do you mean personal issues?
[8865.58s -> 8870.70s]  Aren't I doing that already?
[8870.70s -> 8872.70s]  I was gonna just try to do a millhouse from
[8872.70s -> 8874.70s]  Simpson's voice, but that would be way too hard.
[8874.70s -> 8887.55s]  Following me?
[8887.55s -> 8889.55s]  I still gotta get some more.
[8889.55s -> 8891.55s]  You have something that's... Wait, interview.
[8893.55s -> 8895.55s]  Bilbo gave you...
[8895.55s -> 8900.22s]  That's the fucking bugs.
[8900.22s -> 8902.22s]  Holy shit. I don't know if you could even...
[8902.22s -> 8904.22s]  Hold on.
[8906.22s -> 8910.06s]  What do you do professionally though?
[8922.22s -> 8924.22s]  Is this a spy?
[8924.22s -> 8927.36s]  Is that fun fact unrelated?
[8931.36s -> 8933.36s]  Oh.
[8941.01s -> 8943.01s]  Oh shit, I ain't even recording.
[8943.01s -> 8945.57s]  Oh well, she won't even fucking notice.
[8945.57s -> 8947.57s]  I'm not even recording.
[8956.54s -> 8958.54s]  Drama? Oh my god.
[8958.54s -> 8960.54s]  Feed me.
[8972.10s -> 8974.10s]  So you're an international criminal
[8974.10s -> 8976.10s]  and you steal from the farmer.
[8976.10s -> 8980.77s]  That's a grade A awful.
[8992.77s -> 8996.35s]  Where's Lizbert?
[8996.35s -> 8998.35s]  Tell me.
[9001.42s -> 9005.07s]  You wanna go to jail?
[9009.07s -> 9011.07s]  What is it?
[9017.38s -> 9019.94s]  What is it?
[9019.94s -> 9022.75s]  Hamburger bug snacks.
[9027.38s -> 9029.38s]  That's everybody's weakness though.
[9029.38s -> 9031.38s]  I don't buy that.
[9031.38s -> 9033.38s]  Uh oh.
[9044.67s -> 9046.67s]  Egobel, suspicious.
[9046.67s -> 9048.67s]  Egobel,
[9048.67s -> 9050.67s]  you could shorten that a little
[9050.67s -> 9052.67s]  and say something about how suspicious
[9052.67s -> 9054.67s]  Egobel is.
[9061.26s -> 9063.26s]  Oh, I have a key.
[9063.26s -> 9065.26s]  I have two keys.
[9068.98s -> 9071.28s]  Alright, so I have two.
[9071.28s -> 9073.28s]  Let me try to open that door.
[9073.28s -> 9079.47s]  Walking my way out.
[9079.47s -> 9083.31s]  Fine, I'll just barrel through.
[9083.31s -> 9085.31s]  Where's this little cabin somewhere?
[9085.31s -> 9091.84s]  Wait, what's this way? This is like a desert.
[9091.84s -> 9096.11s]  We're gonna get some desert bugs?
[9096.11s -> 9103.34s]  Wrong way?
[9103.34s -> 9105.34s]  Yeah, I haven't seen anything over here.
[9105.34s -> 9115.39s]  Scorched gorge.
[9115.39s -> 9117.39s]  Oh, it's a chili pepper, a scorpeno.
[9117.39s -> 9122.38s]  The snack wabs fiery peppers
[9122.38s -> 9124.38s]  at anything that catches its attention.
[9124.38s -> 9129.57s]  I like that one.
[9129.57s -> 9131.57s]  What's that thing?
[9131.57s -> 9133.57s]  Weird.
[9133.57s -> 9135.57s]  A pop tick. They are too small to catch in a trap
[9135.57s -> 9138.19s]  but maybe some heat will puff them up.
[9138.19s -> 9140.19s]  Alright, hold on. What about you?
[9140.19s -> 9142.56s]  What does a scorpeno like?
[9142.56s -> 9144.99s]  Loves? What's the orange thing?
[9144.99s -> 9149.47s]  So I can have them kind of pop the popcorns.
[9149.47s -> 9152.99s]  It's mustard?
[9152.99s -> 9161.36s]  Why do you get mustard?
[9161.36s -> 9163.36s]  What's that? A spuddy.
[9163.36s -> 9165.36s]  It protects its territory by charging intruders
[9165.36s -> 9167.36s]  with its powerful jaws.
[9167.36s -> 9169.36s]  It loves ketchup.
[9169.36s -> 9171.54s]  Let's catch this motherfucker.
[9171.54s -> 9180.48s]  Is it too big?
[9180.48s -> 9184.32s]  We got a good link. Hold on.
[9184.32s -> 9188.46s]  It's too big.
[9188.46s -> 9190.77s]  He just smashed into the wall.
[9190.77s -> 9198.69s]  Do that again.
[9198.69s -> 9204.58s]  Whoa, whoa! There's a secret in here!
[9204.58s -> 9207.71s]  What the hell is this?
[9207.71s -> 9215.90s]  A mural depicts grumpuses opening a section
[9215.90s -> 9217.90s]  of wall near the river there carrying
[9217.90s -> 9221.87s]  some sort of parcel.
[9221.87s -> 9225.97s]  That's the pizza demon that we saw earlier.
[9225.97s -> 9232.05s]  It's Laura. Secret Laura.
[9232.05s -> 9237.62s]  We got a quest over here.
[9237.62s -> 9241.84s]  Oh my god, it's like a rib.
[9241.84s -> 9248.54s]  Ribble.
[9248.54s -> 9251.68s]  Ribble-pede.
[9251.68s -> 9253.68s]  It likes to hide and sit still. Maybe some sauce
[9253.68s -> 9256.11s]  could get it to move.
[9256.11s -> 9258.42s]  Like barbecue sauce?
[9258.42s -> 9266.99s]  Will you fucking leave me alone?
[9266.99s -> 9274.42s]  You like ketchup?
[9274.42s -> 9280.69s]  Oh, I covered him in ketchup and he hated it.
[9280.69s -> 9283.89s]  I got a ribble-pede.
[9283.89s -> 9286.26s]  How do I stop you from doing this?
[9286.26s -> 9296.30s]  What am I supposed to do with you?
[9296.30s -> 9302.00s]  He's covered in ketchup. Does it make him mad?
[9302.00s -> 9304.94s]  There's a butterfly up there. Hold on.
[9304.94s -> 9308.14s]  Oh, it's Tiffany. Everyone talks shit about you.
[9314.14s -> 9316.14s]  Hit the bug. Wait, wait, hold on.
[9322.58s -> 9330.90s]  Hold on. Somebody got a link.
[9330.90s -> 9335.18s]  That's a good one. This one's not bad.
[9335.18s -> 9344.08s]  It's not bad. It's pretty good.
[9344.08s -> 9349.14s]  I don't know if I love chocolate though.
[9349.14s -> 9351.63s]  I like chocolate. I don't know if I love chocolate.
[9373.63s -> 9375.63s]  Ooh, I got one of those.
[9379.63s -> 9381.63s]  Ooh, how many do you want? Three?
[9381.63s -> 9383.63s]  I can do that.
[9383.63s -> 9385.63s]  Let's go.
[9385.63s -> 9387.63s]  I wanted to get people to come back to town.
[9387.63s -> 9389.63s]  Alright, ribble-pedes.
[9389.63s -> 9393.41s]  There's one right there. What's your trajectory?
[9393.41s -> 9395.41s]  Alright, that's the trajectory.
[9395.41s -> 9398.34s]  Get that shit down. Let's go.
[9398.34s -> 9400.34s]  Toss him up.
[9400.34s -> 9402.64s]  Where'd you go?
[9402.64s -> 9411.78s]  Oh wait, you went all the way around.
[9411.78s -> 9415.68s]  Really strange path you have.
[9415.68s -> 9417.68s]  Alright, one more.
[9417.68s -> 9422.21s]  I like the voice.
[9422.21s -> 9424.70s]  I like the voice.
[9424.70s -> 9428.93s]  I can't wait for the one that's like
[9428.93s -> 9430.93s]  ribble-peded.
[9430.93s -> 9437.26s]  That will be my favorite.
[9444.86s -> 9446.86s]  Okay, every goblin from
[9446.86s -> 9448.86s]  Warcraft and Hearthstone.
[9448.86s -> 9452.83s]  Where do you want me to go? Who is this talking?
[9452.83s -> 9463.89s]  Oh, it's you.
[9463.89s -> 9466.70s]  Wait, a white cheepoof.
[9466.70s -> 9468.70s]  It's a cheese puff.
[9468.70s -> 9472.10s]  You're annoying. Stop doing that.
[9472.10s -> 9476.32s]  Danny DeVito? That would be great.
[9476.32s -> 9479.65s]  Wait, my ball.
[9479.65s -> 9481.65s]  Oh man, I left the ball all the way back there.
[9481.65s -> 9483.65s]  I'm a bad father.
[9483.65s -> 9485.65s]  Come on, I'm back. Wait, he loves this.
[9485.65s -> 9490.18s]  He loves that.
[9490.18s -> 9496.38s]  What do I do with that information?
[9496.38s -> 9498.38s]  Hmm, what does it say?
[9498.38s -> 9500.94s]  Some assembly required. Buy at your own risk.
[9500.94s -> 9504.27s]  All sales are final.
[9504.27s -> 9506.27s]  Offer void where prohibited. Shirt and shoes optional.
[9506.27s -> 9508.27s]  May contain nuts or shellfish. Guarantees not guaranteed.
[9508.27s -> 9510.27s]  Bridge for sale.
[9510.27s -> 9515.38s]  Did you make it up?
[9515.38s -> 9518.19s]  I thought he was covered in blood for a second.
[9518.19s -> 9521.33s]  Oh, what a journey you were on.
[9521.33s -> 9525.49s]  Get away from me. Actually, you know what?
[9525.49s -> 9528.18s]  Come over here. Get over here.
[9528.18s -> 9532.40s]  Come light me up.
[9532.40s -> 9534.90s]  Do that over here.
[9534.90s -> 9538.67s]  Okay, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.
[9538.67s -> 9542.26s]  Pop over here. Pop over here.
[9542.26s -> 9544.26s]  Oh, it's a popcorn! Go, go, go, over here.
[9544.26s -> 9546.26s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[9546.26s -> 9548.26s]  Wait, okay, that's awesome. It's a live popcorn.
[9548.26s -> 9550.50s]  I love it. Give me this back.
[9550.50s -> 9560.78s]  Yes. A pop tick.
[9560.78s -> 9567.49s]  Nice.
[9567.49s -> 9570.30s]  Alright, hold on. I gotta pee again.
[9570.30s -> 9571.62s]  Piss day, for some reason.
[9571.62s -> 9759.06s]  I'll be right back.
[9759.06s -> 9760.46s]  Who's ready to snack?
[9766.39s -> 9768.27s]  Okay.
[9768.27s -> 9769.87s]  Oh, did I not even put it on the VRB screen?
[9769.87s -> 9771.51s]  I just walked away.
[9771.51s -> 9773.26s]  Shit.
[9773.26s -> 9775.25s]  I thought I did.
[9775.25s -> 9777.80s]  I didn't even switch it.
[9777.80s -> 9779.11s]  Whoops.
[9779.11s -> 9783.26s]  All right, we need one more Ribble pea.
[9783.26s -> 9784.68s]  I got the popcorn one, so that's good.
[9784.68s -> 9787.34s]  I'm happy about that.
[9787.34s -> 9790.36s]  All right, they're in the ruins, the ancient ruins.
[9794.07s -> 9795.98s]  We got the one in here.
[9795.98s -> 9797.69s]  What about the one over here?
[9797.73s -> 9799.21s]  Is there more than one in here?
[9799.21s -> 9804.06s]  Yep.
[9804.06s -> 9805.02s]  Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[9805.02s -> 9806.70s]  What was the name of that game
[9806.70s -> 9808.34s]  that everybody told me to play?
[9808.34s -> 9810.94s]  That was the photography game.
[9810.94s -> 9813.45s]  Have we played that game, Africa?
[9813.45s -> 9818.26s]  I completely forgot the name of the game.
[9818.26s -> 9822.66s]  No, no, no, it's, it's, it's, it's some, it's a,
[9822.66s -> 9823.94s]  it's like, oh, he loves taking pictures.
[9823.94s -> 9826.42s]  It's a picture of a take photos game.
[9826.42s -> 9830.26s]  No, not Dragon Rampa, something else.
[9830.26s -> 9834.00s]  It's like, no, not Pokemon Snap.
[9834.00s -> 9838.76s]  No, no, no, no.
[9838.76s -> 9840.20s]  No, no, no, no, no, not horror.
[9840.20s -> 9842.24s]  It's, it's like a,
[9842.28s -> 9843.40s]  the color scheme is like this.
[9843.40s -> 9844.24s]  It looks like this.
[9844.24s -> 9847.20s]  The color scheme is like pink, teal, and electrified.
[9847.20s -> 9851.61s]  And it has a Uru, Uru Gami Generation.
[9851.61s -> 9852.45s]  That's the one, right?
[9852.45s -> 9855.58s]  That's it.
[9855.58s -> 9858.58s]  Uru Ga, or Uru Gami Generation.
[9858.58s -> 9861.43s]  All right, is that game any good?
[9861.43s -> 9862.71s]  Did I play that game?
[9862.71s -> 9863.55s]  People kept telling me it was like the,
[9863.55s -> 9871.02s]  it was a photo game.
[9871.02s -> 9872.86s]  You have to play Dragon Rampa.
[9872.86s -> 9876.03s]  I probably won't.
[9876.03s -> 9881.55s]  All right, let's go back and deliver.
[9881.55s -> 9883.83s]  Uh, wait, do you want to eat these?
[9883.83s -> 9885.74s]  Have a good one.
[9885.74s -> 9889.03s]  You want, you want to eat these?
[9889.03s -> 9890.63s]  I thought you wanted to study them.
[9895.58s -> 9897.34s]  This just looks like you,
[9897.34s -> 9904.85s]  you got your arms and legs cut off.
[9904.85s -> 9908.89s]  Yes, Rivelpedes only look like they have bones.
[9908.89s -> 9912.04s]  They're squishy all the way through.
[9912.04s -> 9915.40s]  So what did these fellas eat then?
[9915.40s -> 9918.28s]  Well, like grandma always said,
[9918.28s -> 9921.28s]  if you want answers, dig through their sock drawer.
[9921.28s -> 9923.72s]  I want to get into that dwelling over there,
[9923.72s -> 9925.08s]  but the door's blocked up.
[9925.08s -> 9925.92s]  I already opened it.
[9925.92s -> 9928.32s]  If you could do something to get that door open.
[9928.36s -> 9929.20s]  I'll go in.
[9929.20s -> 9931.00s]  I opened it accidentally.
[9931.00s -> 9933.52s]  I'm like Mr. Magood into the ruins.
[9933.52s -> 9934.48s]  So go ahead.
[9944.18s -> 9947.10s]  What the fuck are you going to do about it?
[9947.10s -> 9948.38s]  Oh, look at me, I can charge.
[9948.38s -> 9950.14s]  Look at me, I'm so fast.
[9950.14s -> 9952.02s]  Yeah, what are you going to do?
[9952.02s -> 9952.86s]  Ha ha ha.
[9952.86s -> 9953.70s]  Ha ha ha.
[9959.14s -> 9960.50s]  Get out.
[9960.50s -> 9963.26s]  These murals are still preserved.
[9963.26s -> 9964.66s]  As far as I know,
[9964.66s -> 9967.58s]  we were the first grumps to settle this island.
[9967.58s -> 9970.22s]  But here we got a thousand years of history
[9970.22s -> 9971.06s]  and accounted for.
[9971.06s -> 9972.46s]  There were a thousand grumps before us.
[9972.46s -> 9976.34s]  Generations of grumpuses who hunted and ate bug snacks.
[9976.34s -> 9979.98s]  Just a cosmic reminder that nothing really lasts, eh?
[9979.98s -> 9980.82s]  Bug snacks.
[9980.82s -> 9981.66s]  What's this?
[9981.66s -> 9985.02s]  Looks like there's a hidden chamber somewhere in the canyon.
[9985.02s -> 9987.94s]  Could that be where they stored bug snacks?
[9987.94s -> 9990.30s]  Would you mind finding that chamber?
[9990.30s -> 9992.46s]  And if there's bug snacks there,
[9992.46s -> 9994.06s]  please bring them to me.
[9994.06s -> 9995.38s]  Bye bye.
[9995.38s -> 9996.86s]  Find and enter the hidden ruins.
[9996.86s -> 9998.46s]  How am I supposed to do that?
[10001.42s -> 10005.33s]  That's not a whole lot of info.
[10005.33s -> 10007.97s]  Opening a section of wall near the river.
[10007.97s -> 10009.05s]  They're carrying a parcel.
[10009.05s -> 10010.65s]  Section of wall near the river.
[10011.57s -> 10019.54s]  Okay, let's go find it.
[10019.54s -> 10024.22s]  Find a river.
[10024.22s -> 10027.19s]  Scan the moth painting.
[10027.19s -> 10029.63s]  Oh, I'm so, I'm so sorry.
[10029.63s -> 10037.82s]  I'm so sorry.
[10037.86s -> 10046.34s]  I already did.
[10046.34s -> 10047.18s]  Donate the popcorn?
[10047.18s -> 10048.74s]  I will once I find the hidden ruins
[10048.74s -> 10052.46s]  and do this for Green Grover.
[10052.46s -> 10055.68s]  All right, hidden, here's the river.
[10055.68s -> 10057.96s]  Is the arrow pointing me to where the, no.
[10057.96s -> 10059.76s]  All right, there's a section of this wall
[10059.76s -> 10061.24s]  somewhere over here.
[10061.24s -> 10064.90s]  It needs to be, it's probably right there.
[10064.90s -> 10074.27s]  You, I need you to run at me really fast.
[10074.27s -> 10077.27s]  Come over here.
[10077.27s -> 10078.83s]  Hey, don't you like sauce?
[10078.83s -> 10079.67s]  I got lots of sauce.
[10079.67s -> 10088.12s]  I got lots of red sauce inside of my body.
[10088.12s -> 10089.30s]  What's wrong?
[10089.30s -> 10093.23s]  Wait, let me just double check.
[10094.73s -> 10095.57s]  Near the river.
[10095.57s -> 10100.12s]  Ah, I found it.
[10100.12s -> 10103.60s]  Right here.
[10103.60s -> 10104.44s]  Look at me.
[10104.44s -> 10107.84s]  I'm covered in sauce.
[10107.84s -> 10112.28s]  Oh, whoa, whoa.
[10112.28s -> 10125.94s]  Okay, no, nobody, I can't get the door open now.
[10125.94s -> 10127.86s]  I'll get, hold on, I'll get another one.
[10127.86s -> 10136.01s]  There's one back here, right?
[10136.01s -> 10140.56s]  Just cover the ball in sauce and it'll follow me around.
[10140.56s -> 10148.24s]  There you go, okay, cover this ball in sauce.
[10148.24s -> 10154.38s]  Follow me.
[10154.38s -> 10155.46s]  Wait, there's another popcorn.
[10155.46s -> 10160.52s]  Am I gonna die?
[10160.52s -> 10165.38s]  You shithead.
[10165.38s -> 10166.42s]  Come over here.
[10166.42s -> 10168.58s]  No.
[10168.58s -> 10170.98s]  Whatever, I don't need another popcorn, I don't care.
[10170.98s -> 10174.82s]  Give me this back.
[10174.82s -> 10176.35s]  Where'd he go?
[10176.35s -> 10178.23s]  Where's my, where is he, where is he?
[10180.85s -> 10183.56s]  Where'd he go?
[10183.56s -> 10185.36s]  Crying, Jerma, I'm sorry that you're crying.
[10185.36s -> 10187.18s]  What happened?
[10187.18s -> 10192.55s]  Where did that guy go?
[10192.55s -> 10200.77s]  Where did he go?
[10200.77s -> 10201.77s]  Am I insane?
[10201.77s -> 10204.31s]  Where did he go?
[10204.31s -> 10211.36s]  Oh, you went all the way down here, perfect, okay.
[10211.36s -> 10216.17s]  Keep going.
[10216.17s -> 10220.45s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, follow me.
[10220.45s -> 10234.71s]  No, no, no, no, please.
[10234.71s -> 10236.05s]  Break it.
[10236.05s -> 10240.39s]  Yeah, now get out of here.
[10240.95s -> 10242.43s]  Is that extra dogs?
[10242.43s -> 10243.63s]  What are those?
[10243.63s -> 10244.55s]  Now you're in here with me
[10244.55s -> 10248.93s]  and I don't want you in here with me.
[10248.93s -> 10253.51s]  Catch one weenie worm.
[10253.51s -> 10254.71s]  What do you like?
[10254.71s -> 10258.17s]  Oh, you're very dirty.
[10258.17s -> 10261.46s]  It's only motivated by its hatred of ketchup.
[10261.46s -> 10263.66s]  Okay, well, you don't like ketchup, then I'm sorry,
[10263.66s -> 10268.76s]  but why don't you get away from that?
[10268.76s -> 10269.84s]  Oh, you don't like ketchup.
[10269.84s -> 10271.28s]  Oh, shit.
[10271.28s -> 10274.52s]  Wait a minute, I just covered him with,
[10274.52s -> 10279.33s]  why did he just get big and red?
[10279.33s -> 10291.25s]  He got big and red.
[10291.25s -> 10293.96s]  Holy shit, okay, I got him.
[10293.96s -> 10296.74s]  Okay, catch one weenie worm, feed.
[10296.74s -> 10314.99s]  Oh, eat what?
[10314.99s -> 10320.14s]  Let me look at my book.
[10320.14s -> 10322.69s]  What's with you?
[10322.69s -> 10331.16s]  Weenie worm loves mustard, hates ketchup.
[10331.16s -> 10333.64s]  It's only motivated by its hatred of ketchup.
[10333.64s -> 10339.76s]  What does it eat?
[10339.76s -> 10342.47s]  Eat it to her.
[10342.47s -> 10356.66s]  Oh, right, okay.
[10356.66s -> 10358.88s]  I think I want another Steak'em's.
[10358.88s -> 10360.48s]  I wanna give somebody a Steak'em's
[10360.48s -> 10362.56s]  and have it be like their Steak'em's brain.
[10362.56s -> 10364.65s]  Give it in their head.
[10364.65s -> 10367.46s]  It's your trajectory, right?
[10367.78s -> 10369.14s]  Here, look at that.
[10369.14s -> 10371.26s]  Okay, get ready.
[10371.26s -> 10374.50s]  And shoot you, and I'll take one, please.
[10374.50s -> 10376.30s]  Now we have full inventory, let's go.
[10379.64s -> 10383.27s]  Oh, wait, there's this weird guy up here.
[10383.27s -> 10386.50s]  What's his problem?
[10386.50s -> 10391.41s]  Pacing you?
[10391.41s -> 10394.01s]  Oh, it's anger from inside out.
[10394.01s -> 10397.38s]  Hello, friend, welcome, but take a look.
[10397.38s -> 10400.22s]  I assure you, you won't be disappointed.
[10401.42s -> 10403.50s]  The name's Cromdo Face,
[10403.50s -> 10406.02s]  the one and only salesman in paradise.
[10406.74s -> 10408.30s]  Let's eat.
[10408.30s -> 10410.90s]  Okay, what do you like to eat?
[10410.90s -> 10413.94s]  Friend, have I got a bridge to sell you.
[10413.94s -> 10415.82s]  Beautiful, isn't it?
[10415.82s -> 10417.10s]  Did I weenie dog him?
[10417.10s -> 10419.22s]  New construction, huh?
[10419.22s -> 10422.10s]  Oh, baby, what a bridge.
[10422.10s -> 10425.50s]  All yours for just 100 bucks next.
[10425.50s -> 10426.50s]  What do you say?
[10428.10s -> 10429.54s]  I can't even carry that much.
[10431.06s -> 10433.18s]  Can't afford it, no problem.
[10433.18s -> 10435.62s]  I got a specialty item just for you.
[10435.66s -> 10438.02s]  Cheap as free, follow me, pal.
[10440.85s -> 10442.41s]  I think I wanna follow you.
[10442.41s -> 10446.29s]  Feast your eyes on this beautiful lunch pad.
[10446.29s -> 10448.49s]  Totally for sale and not at all stolen.
[10449.53s -> 10451.29s]  You're itching to try it out, I can tell.
[10451.29s -> 10453.01s]  Does it bounce, pal?
[10453.01s -> 10455.41s]  My windmills over there got stuck.
[10455.41s -> 10457.69s]  Why don't you take it for a spin
[10457.69s -> 10459.25s]  and knock him into shape?
[10459.25s -> 10460.81s]  Yeah, will you go back to town?
[10462.56s -> 10464.48s]  Switch to it with Q.
[10464.48s -> 10475.23s]  Wait, aim.
[10475.27s -> 10479.40s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, what?
[10479.40s -> 10492.80s]  Why was that not ready?
[10492.80s -> 10497.56s]  God damn it, wait, I'll be back.
[10497.56s -> 10500.20s]  I feel like I'm playing 007, GoldenEye.
[10500.20s -> 10510.30s]  Isn't there a watch that you can laser people?
[10510.30s -> 10515.19s]  All right, aim, launch.
[10515.19s -> 10518.02s]  You understand what the fuck just happened?
[10518.02s -> 10519.26s]  Why is it changing?
[10519.26s -> 10526.83s]  I'm aiming and then I'm just, I'm launching.
[10526.83s -> 10529.85s]  Too heavy, okay.
[10529.85s -> 10537.30s]  Aim, what?
[10537.30s -> 10539.76s]  Why can I not do this?
[10539.76s -> 10549.57s]  See ya.
[10549.57s -> 10550.97s]  No, deploy.
[10550.97s -> 10553.89s]  No, you don't.
[10553.89s -> 10572.94s]  Pick this up.
[10572.94s -> 10584.86s]  Bingo.
[10584.86s -> 10586.26s]  And one more.
[10586.26s -> 10589.49s]  I thought it wanted me to launch myself at it.
[10589.49s -> 10593.85s]  Sorry, I don't have one of those fancy science degrees.
[10593.85s -> 10596.13s]  I just hurt my throat doing that, I don't know why.
[10596.13s -> 10600.98s]  Oh, I feel that hot, sweaty breeze.
[10600.98s -> 10602.54s]  Now it's time to pay up.
[10602.54s -> 10604.50s]  What, you used it, you bought it.
[10604.50s -> 10607.30s]  There's no such thing as a free lunch.
[10607.30s -> 10610.62s]  Hey, hey, you can pay me three of those cheap hoops.
[10610.62s -> 10611.46s]  Cheap hoops?
[10611.46s -> 10613.90s]  Oh, great, fly it around.
[10613.90s -> 10617.38s]  Let's see how they like flying into my mouth.
[10617.38s -> 10619.58s]  Do I have to catch the cheap hoops?
[10619.58s -> 10625.58s]  Five, four, three, two, one.
[10625.58s -> 10634.35s]  No, what happened?
[10634.35s -> 10635.51s]  Oh, okay.
[10635.51s -> 10636.35s]  I can't do this yet.
[10636.35s -> 10642.08s]  I have to deliver this stuff.
[10642.08s -> 10647.26s]  I'll come back into this later.
[10647.26s -> 10649.64s]  Yeah, I got priorities.
[10649.64s -> 10652.33s]  Where is she?
[10652.33s -> 10659.65s]  Digging over here.
[10659.65s -> 10660.77s]  His eyes may as well be closed.
[10660.77s -> 10661.77s]  He has no idea what he's doing.
[10661.77s -> 10663.01s]  What are you talking about?
[10664.31s -> 10666.27s]  I have a weenie dog right here.
[10684.49s -> 10686.85s]  I found a lot of corpses.
[10689.49s -> 10690.97s]  Spender Otto, I did not.
[10700.94s -> 10703.26s]  Well, I gotta solve this mystery.
[10703.26s -> 10705.78s]  Sorry, but I won't be going back to Snaxburg.
[10705.78s -> 10706.82s]  You will, eventually.
[10707.74s -> 10709.46s]  If Wambus wants me back,
[10709.46s -> 10712.46s]  well, he can come out here and tell me himself.
[10713.50s -> 10716.22s]  You might have heard things haven't been too good
[10716.22s -> 10717.98s]  between us.
[10717.98s -> 10721.54s]  I keep telling myself I'll get around to C&M,
[10721.54s -> 10726.54s]  but it's just easier to stay out here with the bone.
[10727.38s -> 10731.10s]  Weird lady, weird lady, weird lady, weird lady,
[10731.10s -> 10732.14s]  weird lady, weird lady.
[10732.14s -> 10732.98s]  Get out.
[10737.58s -> 10738.66s]  What?
[10738.66s -> 10739.50s]  She's going back, I did it.
[10739.50s -> 10743.12s]  I win.
[10743.12s -> 10754.35s]  I did it.
[10754.35s -> 10755.91s]  I thought she said she wasn't gonna be going back
[10755.91s -> 10760.42s]  to Snaxburg.
[10760.42s -> 10762.42s]  Your mind changed immediately.
[10762.42s -> 10772.08s]  All right, I gotta donate these.
[10772.08s -> 10775.78s]  We told her about the cactus wipe, I did.
[10775.78s -> 10779.38s]  I did good.
[10779.38s -> 10784.45s]  She would be good at Among Us, unlike you.
[10784.49s -> 10786.09s]  Is that supposed to be an insult?
[10786.09s -> 10787.33s]  It doesn't insult me.
[10790.25s -> 10791.09s]  I don't care.
[10797.76s -> 10800.08s]  If I played Among Us and I got imposter,
[10800.08s -> 10801.92s]  I would just immediately just start killing everybody
[10801.92s -> 10803.96s]  at the spawn while cackling like,
[10803.96s -> 10807.92s]  ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, until I was removed from the lobby
[10807.92s -> 10809.48s]  and then I would end my stream.
[10816.00s -> 10819.88s]  And then I would write on Twitter.
[10821.20s -> 10823.20s]  Kind of pissed off that people don't wanna play with me
[10823.20s -> 10824.68s]  and it's annoying.
[10824.68s -> 10825.64s]  What the fuck?
[10825.64s -> 10826.48s]  What did I do?
[10830.02s -> 10831.38s]  You're like, that's bullshit.
[10831.38s -> 10832.66s]  I wanna, why?
[10832.66s -> 10833.50s]  Why'd they kick me out?
[10833.50s -> 10835.10s]  I would just start a ton of problems.
[10841.33s -> 10842.41s]  Teenage girl.
[10855.78s -> 10857.06s]  Oh, look, we did good.
[10857.06s -> 10858.18s]  Time for the interview.
[10859.06s -> 10861.68s]  Sounds like a real hoot.
[10861.68s -> 10863.80s]  He's been fucking a cactus?
[10863.80s -> 10867.17s]  Ow.
[10867.17s -> 10869.17s]  All right, who are you?
[10869.17s -> 10871.41s]  Oh, I go digging up bits of history
[10871.41s -> 10873.73s]  and try to piece them back together.
[10873.73s -> 10875.65s]  It's usually not so dramatic.
[10875.65s -> 10879.29s]  Just an old coin or a severed toe under a rock.
[10879.29s -> 10884.38s]  But this island's chock full of fines.
[10884.38s -> 10885.66s]  What was your name?
[10885.66s -> 10887.38s]  Oh, goodness, my name.
[10887.38s -> 10889.66s]  I'm Trifoni Lottoblog.
[10889.66s -> 10891.70s]  That's just, it's just Steve Bruhl.
[10892.58s -> 10894.52s]  Hey, Trifoni.
[10894.52s -> 10895.36s]  Trifoni Lottoblog.
[10909.04s -> 10910.36s]  All right, who's grandma?
[10910.36s -> 10911.20s]  Lisbur.
[10915.00s -> 10916.44s]  Sounds like Sarah Palin.
[10923.44s -> 10927.53s]  Pfft.
[10932.53s -> 10935.29s]  It's just, yeah, it's just like generic mid-western.
[10938.65s -> 10939.61s]  It's not Norwegian.
[10939.61s -> 10941.29s]  What do you mean Norwegian accent?
[10957.70s -> 10964.86s]  I want this accent to tell me nursery rhymes.
[10983.58s -> 10985.10s]  Oh, fuck that, this is my accent.
[10985.10s -> 10988.70s]  We'll go on, start reading us some Hansel and Gretel
[10988.70s -> 10989.54s]  or whatever.
[10992.02s -> 10996.83s]  Our grizzliest scars.
[10996.83s -> 10999.35s]  Adventuring is a dangerous business.
[10999.35s -> 11003.59s]  Archaeology less so, but the Lottoblog method
[11003.59s -> 11006.39s]  can be unconventional.
[11006.39s -> 11008.35s]  Bug the heck out of Agabelle.
[11008.35s -> 11011.11s]  She never liked to see anyone hurt.
[11011.11s -> 11013.15s]  Least of all, Liz.
[11013.15s -> 11015.15s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[11016.79s -> 11019.19s]  I hope that she doesn't die in a QTE.
[11019.19s -> 11020.03s]  Ha ha ha.
[11020.03s -> 11020.87s]  Ha ha ha.
[11027.83s -> 11029.31s]  That's very, very specific.
[11029.31s -> 11033.03s]  Ha, I think it's still funny.
[11033.03s -> 11035.27s]  That's very specific, but I really do think
[11035.27s -> 11038.21s]  that what you just said is funny.
[11038.21s -> 11039.85s]  Thanks, Tiffany, I learned a lot.
[11039.85s -> 11042.05s]  Have fun, have an easy one, bye.
[11051.77s -> 11053.53s]  You might have better luck with it.
[11054.41s -> 11057.33s]  Anywho, I've nearly talked your ear off.
[11057.33s -> 11058.17s]  This is shit load of subs.
[11058.17s -> 11061.27s]  Better get back to work, eh?
[11061.27s -> 11068.19s]  WTR6K4DA, these are the 20 community subs.
[11068.19s -> 11072.34s]  20 subs, thank you.
[11072.34s -> 11079.70s]  WTR6K4DA, thank you.
[11079.70s -> 11081.66s]  Pick a diary, Liz's cabinet key.
[11081.66s -> 11083.82s]  Oh, how about the diary?
[11083.82s -> 11086.32s]  Oh, what's in there?
[11086.32s -> 11090.45s]  You picked up Liz's notes on a secret code.
[11090.49s -> 11098.45s]  Holy crap.
[11098.45s -> 11100.49s]  Looks like I need to weigh down the pressure plates
[11100.49s -> 11106.32s]  in order, first left, and then we don't know.
[11106.32s -> 11107.16s]  Holy crapple.
[11107.16s -> 11111.00s]  Here, why don't you eat, here, have some,
[11111.00s -> 11113.28s]  have some baked potato in the tinfoil.
[11120.82s -> 11123.02s]  Oh, God.
[11123.02s -> 11127.12s]  Ah, those of you guys with fillings,
[11127.12s -> 11129.00s]  putting tinfoil in your mouth is just,
[11129.00s -> 11131.12s]  get it out and get it away.
[11131.12s -> 11136.02s]  Oh my God, that's horrible.
[11136.02s -> 11139.41s]  Ah, I hate it.
[11139.41s -> 11141.19s]  Why would they do that?
[11142.15s -> 11145.99s]  Okay, let's donate a Ripplepeed.
[11145.99s -> 11147.75s]  A, we have to do them all.
[11147.75s -> 11150.83s]  Shy, Weenie, Worm, Spuddy, and a Poptick.
[11151.67s -> 11153.87s]  Size of your heart has grown and so has your inventory.
[11153.87s -> 11156.02s]  Oh, there we go.
[11156.02s -> 11157.18s]  By how much?
[11157.18s -> 11159.65s]  By two?
[11159.65s -> 11161.73s]  12 donations now.
[11161.73s -> 11166.81s]  Look, we can see they're all friends.
[11166.81s -> 11171.20s]  Look at them.
[11171.20s -> 11173.42s]  That's my favorite.
[11173.42s -> 11174.74s]  Move.
[11174.74s -> 11177.22s]  Move, streamer, I wanna see Otto.
[11177.22s -> 11180.43s]  Move.
[11180.43s -> 11188.22s]  They're gonna, we're having so much fun.
[11189.06s -> 11194.98s]  They're having so much fun in here.
[11194.98s -> 11206.19s]  All right, now, what do I actually have for quests?
[11206.19s -> 11209.00s]  There's a lot of world here.
[11209.00s -> 11210.62s]  Okay, quests.
[11210.62s -> 11214.32s]  I can do the cheesy poofs.
[11214.32s -> 11215.76s]  Wiggle would like to talk to you about something
[11215.76s -> 11220.18s]  at the beach.
[11220.18s -> 11222.64s]  Turn the grumps to snackberg.
[11222.64s -> 11224.12s]  Okay, so I have to get everyone to come back
[11224.12s -> 11224.96s]  and then interview everyone.
[11224.96s -> 11226.40s]  That's the main quest.
[11226.40s -> 11227.80s]  What about this one?
[11227.80s -> 11228.84s]  Do I enjoy this game so far?
[11228.84s -> 11230.50s]  Yeah, it's good.
[11230.50s -> 11231.58s]  Well, I'm gonna, let's go to this one.
[11231.58s -> 11233.26s]  Let's track that one.
[11233.26s -> 11240.37s]  Let's go to the beach.
[11240.41s -> 11245.67s]  Why are you playing this?
[11245.67s -> 11246.59s]  It's very cute.
[11246.59s -> 11254.22s]  I could see how this would be relaxing and fun to play.
[11254.22s -> 11259.79s]  All right, we're looking for the guitar player.
[11259.79s -> 11262.07s]  Sweetie fly zips around fast to evade traps
[11262.07s -> 11265.26s]  but eventually it sets down to rest.
[11265.26s -> 11266.10s]  I kinda wanna catch it.
[11266.10s -> 11268.62s]  Where do you land?
[11268.62s -> 11270.90s]  Land over on that rock there.
[11270.90s -> 11279.90s]  All right, let me get your ass.
[11279.90s -> 11283.18s]  What do you like?
[11283.18s -> 11284.31s]  Catch up?
[11284.31s -> 11286.43s]  No, all right, you'll come down here and land.
[11286.43s -> 11301.80s]  I'll be ready.
[11301.80s -> 11306.20s]  Aha, we got a lovely sweetie fly.
[11306.20s -> 11307.24s]  Are there legendaries in this game
[11307.24s -> 11312.50s]  where shiny is like Pokemon?
[11312.50s -> 11313.70s]  Oh, hi darling.
[11313.70s -> 11317.90s]  Welcome to wiggle, wiggle bottom steamy walking tour.
[11317.90s -> 11318.74s]  Lucky you.
[11318.74s -> 11320.82s]  It's an ooey gooey sweetie fly.
[11320.82s -> 11324.10s]  Oh, I can see you're utterly starstruck.
[11324.10s -> 11325.34s]  Don't fret, darling.
[11325.34s -> 11328.14s]  I always have time for my fans.
[11331.73s -> 11334.05s]  Go back to, uh, Sackberg.
[11335.05s -> 11337.25s]  Darling, it will have to wait.
[11337.25s -> 11341.21s]  I simply cannot rest until I find my muse.
[11341.21s -> 11342.85s]  And by muse, I mean butt snacks.
[11342.85s -> 11343.69s]  What's your favorite?
[11343.69s -> 11344.53s]  I might have it.
[11344.53s -> 11347.33s]  Change starts from the outside in, darling.
[11347.33s -> 11351.57s]  If I want new ideas, I need a new look.
[11351.57s -> 11353.85s]  How about a wild new hairdo?
[11353.85s -> 11354.69s]  A pine-a-tula.
[11354.69s -> 11358.32s]  Get me a pine-a-tula and we'll see what we can do.
[11358.32s -> 11360.20s]  Okay, you want pine-a-tula hair.
[11361.20s -> 11368.50s]  What about a sweetie fly beard?
[11368.50s -> 11369.58s]  Oh, cool.
[11373.13s -> 11377.42s]  But how can you ever play the guitar again?
[11377.42s -> 11386.26s]  All right, let's dig one up.
[11386.30s -> 11389.94s]  Ruined her career, kind of.
[11389.94s -> 11392.30s]  Your trajectory is here.
[11392.30s -> 11393.94s]  Get dug out of the ground.
[11393.94s -> 11398.06s]  Cover you in, I believe it's chocolate.
[11398.06s -> 11399.58s]  Ow.
[11399.58s -> 11406.91s]  All right, somebody dig that up.
[11406.91s -> 11413.87s]  Chocolate.
[11413.87s -> 11414.71s]  Right there.
[11415.87s -> 11420.83s]  You think I'm gonna both?
[11420.83s -> 11422.78s]  Oh, I doubled it up.
[11422.78s -> 11423.62s]  I didn't know you could do that.
[11423.62s -> 11429.24s]  I thought only one could fit in there.
[11429.24s -> 11431.66s]  That's cool to know.
[11431.66s -> 11434.50s]  All right, here you go.
[11434.50s -> 11435.38s]  Pineapple head.
[11441.96s -> 11443.36s]  Struck a chord.
[11443.36s -> 11446.74s]  With a new head, I can think no thoughts.
[11446.74s -> 11449.22s]  That's the magic of bug snacks.
[11449.22s -> 11453.18s]  Now my creative juices can flow.
[11453.18s -> 11454.82s]  This is my favorite character.
[11454.82s -> 11457.58s]  Hmm, I know I'm flowing, I'm flowing.
[11457.58s -> 11463.02s]  Hmm, hmm, hmm, ooh, ooh, ooh.
[11463.02s -> 11464.62s]  La, la, la, la, la, la, la.
[11464.62s -> 11466.70s]  You and me are gonna be really, really good friends.
[11466.70s -> 11467.54s]  I can already tell.
[11467.54s -> 11470.33s]  This flow is more of a dribble.
[11470.33s -> 11472.79s]  Need you to turn it up, darling.
[11472.79s -> 11474.47s]  Buy me a grape skeeter.
[11474.47s -> 11476.63s]  They're too fast for Granville or I to catch,
[11476.63s -> 11478.23s]  but maybe you can find a way to slow them down.
[11478.23s -> 11481.85s]  Grape skeeto?
[11481.85s -> 11483.61s]  Some bug snacks are only around at certain times.
[11483.61s -> 11485.25s]  You can scan evidence in the environment
[11485.25s -> 11487.73s]  to get a clue about when to find them.
[11487.73s -> 11489.77s]  Bug, okay, a grape skeeto.
[11491.38s -> 11499.59s]  I gotta find like grape juice on the ground?
[11499.59s -> 11501.86s]  Evidence.
[11501.86s -> 11502.70s]  Fruity goop.
[11502.70s -> 11505.30s]  This fruity, leafy glob is evidence of a bug snack.
[11505.30s -> 11507.58s]  This bug snack seems to appear at night,
[11507.58s -> 11510.38s]  but not when it's raining.
[11510.38s -> 11516.06s]  Hmm, all right, let's sleep with that grape skeeto.
[11516.06s -> 11521.38s]  Do you have a bed in your house?
[11521.38s -> 11522.22s]  Where's the bed?
[11522.22s -> 11532.16s]  Is there a bed in here?
[11532.16s -> 11538.25s]  All right, sleep until midnight.
[11538.25s -> 11539.09s]  I just heard it.
[11539.09s -> 11543.06s]  Somebody just said their name.
[11546.11s -> 11546.95s]  It's for free.
[11546.95s -> 11548.27s]  That's free.
[11548.27s -> 11552.28s]  All right, grape skeeto.
[11552.28s -> 11556.22s]  Just heard it.
[11556.22s -> 11559.19s]  That would be a grape skeeto.
[11559.19s -> 11560.79s]  This one plumps up and slows down
[11560.79s -> 11563.75s]  if it eats another bug snack and it loves chocolate.
[11563.75s -> 11568.10s]  So let's cover this in chocolate.
[11568.10s -> 11570.18s]  Go eat it.
[11570.18s -> 11572.70s]  Let's get him.
[11572.70s -> 11577.02s]  There you go, there's your grape skeeto.
[11577.02s -> 11578.18s]  Why is the cap a gold?
[11578.18s -> 11579.02s]  I don't know.
[11579.06s -> 11584.87s]  Haven't figured that out yet.
[11584.87s -> 11586.47s]  Okay, here's your grape skeeto.
[11589.22s -> 11593.52s]  What did you want it?
[11593.52s -> 11597.39s]  Did you want it on your hand?
[11597.39s -> 11599.23s]  You never played the guitar again.
[11599.23s -> 11601.99s]  I bandaged up both of your hands.
[11601.99s -> 11606.81s]  And now the ideas will flow.
[11606.81s -> 11609.13s]  Mm-hmm, they gon' flow.
[11609.13s -> 11612.29s]  Ooh, any second now, come on now.
[11612.29s -> 11613.45s]  I assure you.
[11615.31s -> 11617.39s]  You're my favorite political streamer.
[11617.39s -> 11618.23s]  I have nothing.
[11618.23s -> 11619.07s]  Thanks, man.
[11619.07s -> 11620.39s]  You go over the issues here.
[11620.39s -> 11623.19s]  Back on this beach that can give me the inspiration
[11623.19s -> 11628.19s]  that I need, which is why you should look in the desert.
[11628.59s -> 11631.59s]  I need a look that pops, a look that's hot.
[11631.59s -> 11634.03s]  That's why you're here.
[11634.03s -> 11635.99s]  Listen to me talk about the issues.
[11635.99s -> 11638.27s]  If you could go to the Scorched Gorge
[11638.27s -> 11640.43s]  and catch two Pop Sticks.
[11646.04s -> 11651.49s]  Ooh, catch two Pop Sticks.
[11651.49s -> 11658.41s]  From a fix America.
[11658.41s -> 11663.25s]  I'm just a clown.
[11663.25s -> 11664.53s]  I'm just a clown, man.
[11665.49s -> 11672.58s]  I can't fix anything.
[11672.58s -> 11675.90s]  Like Bozo the Clown, like fucking Richard Nixon
[11675.90s -> 11677.66s]  didn't pull Bozo the Clown in and go,
[11677.66s -> 11680.22s]  we need to fight, excuse me, Bozo.
[11680.22s -> 11683.02s]  Well, how do you feel about foreign policy?
[11683.02s -> 11686.86s]  No, I just entertain children.
[11686.86s -> 11687.94s]  Perfect, you get on the board.
[11687.94s -> 11693.54s]  You're perfect for us.
[11693.54s -> 11695.10s]  Not implying that you guys are children.
[11695.10s -> 11696.18s]  I'm implying that you're children.
[11696.18s -> 11697.94s]  None of you guys, maybe some of you are.
[11697.94s -> 11699.98s]  But you had to click that 18 plus logo
[11699.98s -> 11701.66s]  when you got to the stream first.
[11701.66s -> 11703.26s]  So you might be lying.
[11703.30s -> 11705.87s]  Don't lie, that's not good.
[11705.87s -> 11708.62s]  Pop Sticks.
[11708.62s -> 11714.70s]  Wait, is that the popcorn?
[11714.70s -> 11724.35s]  All right, I gotta get two Pop Sticks.
[11724.35s -> 11729.91s]  I'm out.
[11729.91s -> 11732.46s]  I gotta go to the Fire Land.
[11732.46s -> 11736.26s]  Does this game ever get interesting?
[11736.26s -> 11739.26s]  I mean, that depends on what you think is interesting.
[11739.26s -> 11740.30s]  You think collecting bugs
[11740.30s -> 11742.10s]  and taking pictures is interesting?
[11742.10s -> 11747.18s]  Then you're gonna love it.
[11747.18s -> 11751.39s]  You think this is dumb?
[11751.39s -> 11753.11s]  I think you probably wouldn't wanna play it
[11753.11s -> 11757.10s]  if you don't think that like picking up food bugs is cool.
[11757.10s -> 11761.80s]  This is not the game for you.
[11762.44s -> 11763.44s]  Let's just complete this now
[11763.44s -> 11764.76s]  because I know that it's available.
[11764.76s -> 11767.48s]  So let's go to Burning Gorge.
[11767.48s -> 11784.64s]  And yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery.
[11787.99s -> 11789.23s]  I can't even.
[11789.23s -> 11793.38s]  All right, let's get these two.
[11793.38s -> 11799.43s]  Fire, fire!
[11799.43s -> 11804.35s]  No, you burnt my thing.
[11804.35s -> 11809.02s]  All right, you'll come out eventually.
[11809.02s -> 11813.02s]  Did you just torch my shit?
[11813.02s -> 11814.26s]  No!
[11814.26s -> 11816.34s]  Is he gonna burn?
[11816.34s -> 11817.78s]  Why are you doing this, dude?
[11826.01s -> 11828.13s]  The bush is on fire.
[11828.13s -> 11829.53s]  Oh no, it's okay.
[11829.53s -> 11840.97s]  Just burn all the bushes so they can't run away.
[11840.97s -> 11852.40s]  Stop!
[11852.40s -> 11856.26s]  What the fuck?
[11856.26s -> 11857.22s]  Stop burning them.
[11857.22s -> 11867.32s]  Stop lighting them on fire.
[11867.32s -> 11870.54s]  I put them out?
[11870.54s -> 11875.34s]  I can't put them out.
[11875.34s -> 11882.37s]  Hey, you, fuck off.
[11882.37s -> 11887.30s]  Lead them to the river.
[11887.30s -> 11888.18s]  Oh, there we go.
[11888.18s -> 11900.51s]  Oh my God, stop.
[11900.51s -> 11901.35s]  Kill the scorpion?
[11901.35s -> 11909.08s]  I can't.
[11909.08s -> 11909.92s]  How am I supposed to kill it?
[11909.92s -> 11920.69s]  Throw poop.
[11920.69s -> 11921.97s]  Launch pad.
[11921.97s -> 11923.77s]  Okay, I'm gonna throw a rock at this motherfucker.
[11923.77s -> 11935.80s]  I swear to God.
[11936.80s -> 11939.38s]  What do you hate?
[11939.38s -> 11943.26s]  You hate spicy food, but you love mustard food.
[11943.26s -> 11945.26s]  I don't have any of that stuff.
[11945.26s -> 11953.88s]  He's distracted.
[11953.88s -> 11957.97s]  No!
[11957.97s -> 11959.97s]  Sauce near Danny.
[11959.97s -> 11964.56s]  Who the fuck is Danny?
[11964.56s -> 11965.64s]  How do I lure these guys away?
[11965.64s -> 11967.78s]  What do you guys hate?
[11967.78s -> 11978.50s]  They love chocolate.
[11978.50s -> 11979.62s]  Fuck, what am I doing?
[11990.62s -> 12001.65s]  No, do you not see the sauce right here, man?
[12001.65s -> 12003.23s]  Where's the other one?
[12003.23s -> 12015.11s]  I think the other one burnt to death.
[12015.11s -> 12021.03s]  Don't worry, there's more.
[12021.03s -> 12021.87s]  There's one right here.
[12021.91s -> 12025.19s]  All right, pop this guy.
[12025.19s -> 12027.40s]  And actually, pop them both.
[12027.40s -> 12028.72s]  No, don't shoot me with that fire.
[12028.72s -> 12029.56s]  No, don't.
[12029.56s -> 12033.31s]  Oh, you got me with the fire.
[12033.31s -> 12036.51s]  Oh, you got me.
[12036.51s -> 12041.94s]  He actually is getting me and not these.
[12041.94s -> 12051.78s]  Dude, aim at this.
[12051.78s -> 12053.75s]  Pop.
[12053.75s -> 12054.67s]  There's water here.
[12054.67s -> 12056.83s]  I can't pop this.
[12056.83s -> 12063.45s]  Go eat the chocolate.
[12063.45s -> 12071.06s]  Chocolate.
[12071.06s -> 12071.90s]  Can I get them un-popped?
[12071.90s -> 12074.48s]  No, they gotta be popped.
[12074.48s -> 12076.08s]  This is a really shitty place to do this.
[12076.08s -> 12080.61s]  How about over here?
[12080.61s -> 12084.46s]  Build a sentry.
[12084.46s -> 12086.18s]  Go get mustard from the store.
[12086.22s -> 12089.14s]  I feel like I can get one of these.
[12089.14s -> 12090.78s]  How can you be bad at bug snacks?
[12090.78s -> 12093.66s]  I'm not bad at bug snacks.
[12093.66s -> 12098.02s]  This is weird and I'm not bad at bug snacks.
[12098.02s -> 12103.09s]  Bad, you can't be bad at everything, okay?
[12103.09s -> 12103.93s]  There it is.
[12103.93s -> 12106.87s]  All right, he's gonna turn into a popcorn.
[12106.87s -> 12108.07s]  Don't let him, don't let him.
[12108.07s -> 12109.11s]  All right, good, good, good, good, good.
[12109.11s -> 12109.95s]  Okay, now put him in.
[12109.95s -> 12113.19s]  Go, okay, now chocolate over here.
[12113.19s -> 12116.76s]  Follow me.
[12116.76s -> 12119.66s]  No, give me that back.
[12119.66s -> 12121.42s]  Don't touch that, it's not yours.
[12121.42s -> 12122.46s]  All right, watch this, ready?
[12122.46s -> 12124.02s]  Okay.
[12124.02s -> 12125.34s]  Chocolate.
[12125.34s -> 12128.92s]  Get him.
[12129.92s -> 12138.72s]  Fucking piece of shit, I swear to God.
[12138.72s -> 12145.34s]  I have no more sauce.
[12145.34s -> 12151.53s]  Did I eat the bullet?
[12151.53s -> 12154.09s]  Yeah, can I just grab him with a net?
[12154.09s -> 12164.12s]  Yes, okay, okay, we're good, we're good.
[12164.12s -> 12167.20s]  Deliver.
[12167.20s -> 12170.11s]  I am to make a delivery.
[12170.11s -> 12173.03s]  Mad because bad, mad because bad, mad because bad,
[12173.03s -> 12175.92s]  mad because bad, mad because bad.
[12175.92s -> 12178.72s]  Wait, that's a Cheeto puff.
[12178.72s -> 12181.29s]  I need three of these.
[12181.29s -> 12182.13s]  What does it say?
[12182.13s -> 12182.97s]  These things never land
[12182.97s -> 12185.41s]  if only there was a way to catch them midair.
[12185.45s -> 12189.06s]  It's called throw rock at them.
[12189.06s -> 12195.74s]  Hear me out on this one.
[12195.74s -> 12197.46s]  Give me this.
[12197.46s -> 12200.29s]  Give this to me.
[12200.29s -> 12202.80s]  Can't pick up his rock?
[12202.80s -> 12203.96s]  No, I can't even pick the rock up.
[12203.96s -> 12209.30s]  Whatever, I'll be back.
[12209.30s -> 12221.05s]  We gotta feed the Pop Ticks to a guitar person.
[12221.05s -> 12228.29s]  I might be able to bounce myself.
[12228.29s -> 12231.71s]  I'm gonna donate the other ones
[12231.71s -> 12234.11s]  and I'll bring the two Pop Ticks to the lady.
[12234.11s -> 12239.58s]  So donate, donate, donate.
[12239.58s -> 12240.70s]  And we gotta go to the beach.
[12240.70s -> 12242.02s]  Get away from me.
[12242.02s -> 12242.86s]  Oh, yeah.
[12243.30s -> 12245.70s]  They're all so cute.
[12245.70s -> 12247.74s]  Thank you so much.
[12247.74s -> 12250.26s]  Hopefully my little ones will settle down.
[12250.26s -> 12252.74s]  Maybe I can even start training them again.
[12256.61s -> 12259.04s]  Quest complete.
[12259.04s -> 12264.92s]  Now to the beach.
[12264.92s -> 12270.13s]  Maybe this will be enough for her to go back to town.
[12270.13s -> 12272.45s]  Everybody in this game is creepy.
[12272.45s -> 12288.22s]  Yeah, a little.
[12288.22s -> 12293.10s]  Where'd you go?
[12293.10s -> 12294.75s]  Where is she?
[12294.75s -> 12300.12s]  She's in her house like right here.
[12300.12s -> 12301.20s]  She's dead.
[12301.20s -> 12306.04s]  No, she's not right here.
[12306.04s -> 12307.80s]  Okay, two Pop Ticks.
[12307.80s -> 12310.36s]  I guess you're gonna have popcorn feet.
[12310.36s -> 12324.06s]  That's the only thing that's available, right?
[12324.06s -> 12325.26s]  All these feet.
[12325.26s -> 12326.10s]  Ridiculous.
[12326.10s -> 12331.02s]  And I don't have a single new tune in my head.
[12331.02s -> 12334.82s]  Oh, full journey I've taken.
[12336.50s -> 12341.50s]  Darling, I apologize for putting you through such an ordeal.
[12342.86s -> 12344.46s]  It was all for the sake of art.
[12344.46s -> 12345.66s]  What do we think of the theme song?
[12345.66s -> 12348.06s]  And art is priceless.
[12349.10s -> 12350.42s]  Is there a theme song to this game?
[12350.66s -> 12351.82s]  Has she heard it?
[12359.79s -> 12361.51s]  You want to do full, total,
[12361.51s -> 12363.99s]  just transformation to bug snack?

[12562.70s -> 12573.80s]  what what's the logic behind this i don't understand snacksburg is looking pretty
[12573.80s -> 12580.84s]  busy tonight seems like a great time to gather everybody around the old campfire it's exactly
[12581.40s -> 12589.67s]  that's exactly it it's really weird because i feel like they're just throwing out a gigantic net to
[12589.67s -> 12596.23s]  hopefully make like pennies on every dollar you know what i mean and if you do that enough times
[12596.23s -> 12602.97s]  if you just throw out a gigantic net when you when you make potentially like a quarter of a
[12602.97s -> 12618.57s]  penny from like 600 million things is worth it apparently wait we're doing a party and by the way
[12619.21s -> 12625.53s]  why put this shit on youtube feet sitting in the dark i'll tell you there's some spooky stuff out
[12625.53s -> 12634.09s]  there there ain't nothing out there just why upload these songs to youtube are we never are
[12634.09s -> 12638.57s]  we not allowed to listen to these these songs list we're like fucking locked in our basements with
[12638.57s -> 12641.21s]  all the lights are all off and our windows are all closed
[12641.21s -> 12648.41s]  i've seen something similar up on top of the canyon real curious probably just a wild animal

[12694.07s -> 12699.61s]  body wouldn't be there the next day though some of the time there'd be a little left
[12699.61s -> 12707.80s]  just a few bones and then she'll just thinking about it you're getting the

[13910.97s -> 13917.69s]  but instead i found something terrifying towering over the trees would you guys think
[13917.69s -> 13922.49s]  it was funny if i did a stream where every single person in chat was modded her screech
[13922.49s -> 13932.18s]  what definitely and i just had the webcam full cam screaming with like the flight of the bumblebee
[13932.18s -> 13949.90s]  in the background i can't be sure anything said that thing that would be the last stream well
[13949.90s -> 13955.50s]  could be part of the retirement stream whenever that is i feel the warm glow whenever the
[13955.50s -> 13965.69s]  retirement stream is however long that is away we'll do it then in 40 years it's true if you
[13965.69s -> 13975.34s]  don't believe me go and see for yourself now if you'll excuse me i've got music to make

[13983.56s -> 13998.63s]  that's intriguing all right we found that we're gonna go back to becca and then wiggle would like
[13998.63s -> 14005.62s]  to talk to you about something she would what the hell are you lying on the bed frame like the
[14005.62s -> 14021.46s]  headboard that's some discipline if you're not busy darling i could use a helping paw it seems
[14021.46s -> 14028.90s]  like your run-of-the-mill bug snacks aren't getting my creative juices flowing i need something oh
[14028.90s -> 14036.34s]  spectacular i overheard wambus talking about a sando pee oh you want the sub sandwich of many
[14036.34s -> 14045.61s]  pieces working in that's gonna be tricky that may be just what i need okay we need to go get
[14046.41s -> 14056.50s]  sando beads i don't want to do that yet i want to do let's go complete this one and then i want

[19275.16s -> 19299.18s]  taco sauce Wendy has that pretzel burger that's true i wanted to try that for a while now one of
[19299.18s -> 19305.38s]  you guys told me that it wasn't that good though somebody said it was okay it wasn't that great
[19306.02s -> 19318.55s]  so i don't know is it any good all right big bobsicle feet big bobsicle feet
[19319.35s -> 19329.53s]  now you can walk on acid and fire these things better not melt off anyway a deal's a deal friend
[19329.53s -> 19336.18s]  the bridge is yours some assembly required the pretzel burger is good but if you burp after you
[19336.18s -> 19343.03s]  will fucking die and so you know it makes me not want to eat it for any loss or injury something
[19343.51s -> 19349.43s]  of the use of it i i know what you mean by that and that scares me anything at all please please
[19349.43s -> 19361.40s]  please call your friend what does that mean that i am when in my mind i assume that you didn't
[19361.40s -> 19376.63s]  even fix the bridge you didn't do anything what i feel okay if after you eat like a bunch of
[19376.63s -> 19383.27s]  cheese and pretzel and bacon and pub cheese i can imagine the burps would come up and it would be
[19383.59s -> 19387.83s]  number one they would stink right like don't let's be real but be realistic with ourselves
[19387.83s -> 19392.15s]  they probably smell horrible and it would probably burn too like a little like painful and like
[19392.15s -> 19407.94s]  acidity hurt your throat too yeah probably what the fuck is pub cheese you know i don't know what
[19407.94s -> 19418.04s]  it is it's this orange spreadable cream cheese shit that has this odd taste to it what is pub
[19418.12s -> 19440.63s]  cheese it's cheese and alcohol he's from beer no no i don't think it is pub cheese is human vomit
[19440.63s -> 19448.28s]  that's gross it's beer cheese hold on wait wait wait i need to look at this i'm gonna wrap it up
[19448.28s -> 19462.58s]  here by the way pub cheese i'm just curious what this is okay what is pub cheese pub cheese is a
[19462.58s -> 19467.38s]  type of soft cheese spread and dip prepared using cheese as a primary ingredient and usually with
[19467.38s -> 19475.10s]  some type of beer or ale so you were right okay it's beer cheese but it's not i've had pub cheese
[19475.10s -> 19480.22s]  a bunch of times before it i've had specifically beer cheese before and beer cheese to me is way
[19480.22s -> 19492.30s]  better pub cheese doesn't taste like beer cheese to me for some reason now i don't i know everything
[19492.30s -> 19500.70s]  about wendy's well that's interesting because your name is mcgriddle tony you seem to be dabbling in
[19500.70s -> 19506.97s]  the competition as well tony this you're a traitor that's what you are
[19512.98s -> 19522.58s]  that's a great name though mcgriddle tony i know everything about wendy's but here's the thing
[19522.58s -> 19526.10s]  you might know everything about everything about all the fast food places and the mcgriddle might
