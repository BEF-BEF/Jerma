[4.47s -> 6.91s]  Early Andy? No, right on time, Andy.
[7.95s -> 11.41s]  Precisely on time.
[11.49s -> 14.01s]  201?
[14.01s -> 24.24s]  Pacific time? How you doing? Well 201, okay.
[24.72s -> 27.68s]  So in the time it takes to go from 2 to
[28.90s -> 30.90s]  201 is
[30.90s -> 32.74s]  59 seconds, right?
[32.74s -> 35.26s]  So technically if I show up at 2 and
[36.38s -> 39.34s]  58 seconds, I'm still on time.
[39.90s -> 53.05s]  Well, you're gonna like, you're gonna like look over my shoulder and see when I clock in?
[53.49s -> 60.93s]  You know, like what if you like just forget to clock in? Well, what if you clock in?
[60.93s -> 64.73s]  Okay, what if you get there and you have to go to the bathroom or something?
[64.73s -> 71.08s]  You're like, should I get it? I could take a piss real quick. To me, okay, as your boss, right?
[71.08s -> 72.88s]  I'm as your boss.
[72.88s -> 75.72s]  You've got it, but you've got like a 10 minute window there.
[76.24s -> 79.11s]  And I'm talking before or after. It doesn't matter, right?
[79.11s -> 82.05s]  Like you've got like a 10 to 15 minute window where I don't give a shit at all.
[82.45s -> 91.95s]  Like you clock, did you clock in at like
[93.27s -> 104.84s]  208? I don't give a shit at all. I don't care. You know why I have that philosophy?
[107.30s -> 109.30s]  Sometimes I'm two hours late.
[110.14s -> 113.55s]  I'm two hours late, but you better be within 10 minutes.
[114.13s -> 119.68s]  That's not, no, you could show up an hour late too. All right, that's fine.
[120.44s -> 128.68s]  What an excuse.
[128.68s -> 133.00s]  I don't, I don't, punctual, punctual, I'm not punctual.
[133.64s -> 136.96s]  Look, shit happens every second of every day.
[138.40s -> 142.00s]  Oh, you got something to do it at like exactly at 2 p.m., right?
[142.08s -> 145.44s]  Yeah, but like what if you need gas or something? Like, oh fuck, I didn't get gas.
[146.08s -> 149.08s]  Just go get gas. I don't care. It's like 205, 206.
[149.08s -> 151.08s]  I'm not gonna look at the clock and wait for you.
[151.28s -> 155.57s]  Now if it's more than 30 minutes, then like I'm gonna text you and be like, is everything all right?
[156.21s -> 159.13s]  Within 10 to 15, 20, move it up to who cares?
[159.73s -> 168.77s]  What are we doing today? That's a good question because it's gonna be really fun.
[169.45s -> 172.28s]  Today!
[172.28s -> 174.58s]  We are gonna be doing a
[174.74s -> 181.18s]  stream, a special stream. We did this about a year and a half ago, two years ago, and we're gonna do it again.
[182.06s -> 184.48s]  There's been requests to bring this back.
[185.12s -> 191.87s]  It's a really fun time. I don't know what we're gonna get. It's a gigantic gotcha
[192.39s -> 197.39s]  of every single video and broadcast I've ever done. And what does that mean?
[197.83s -> 202.04s]  So Lazy Luke, sort of the community webmaster here,
[202.80s -> 206.44s]  put together this kind of randomizer of everything I've ever done a
[207.24s -> 209.99s]  couple of years ago, and we did it and
[210.71s -> 213.55s]  there's a big, I think as of now, since it's been updated.
[214.15s -> 219.43s]  The last year or two of streams, it has been put in here, too. So we might get something that happened like a week ago.
[220.03s -> 222.52s]  So what happens is
[222.56s -> 224.56s]  it's a little randomizer site.
[224.88s -> 228.04s]  You click a button and it's going to give you
[228.64s -> 230.40s]  a random
[230.40s -> 236.87s]  timestamp of a random VOD or video over the last 11 years.
[240.00s -> 242.00s]  And it totals out to be
[242.72s -> 244.72s]  something like over
[245.08s -> 249.15s]  4,000 hours of video, which is about 170 days.
[249.75s -> 255.41s]  So if you just let this go and just watch every single thing I've ever done, it would take you
[255.81s -> 257.81s]  170 days straight, 24 hours.
[258.17s -> 268.00s]  Which is weird to think about. I'm surprised there's that much even. It's weird. And we're gonna watch the whole thing.
[268.00s -> 274.38s]  No, we're not. There's gonna be a few rules here. You better get cracking. No, just hold on. There's rules.
[274.66s -> 276.46s]  You have to follow the rules.
[276.46s -> 284.74s]  Rule number one. Each one of these has a timer of 120 seconds. I am thinking of making that higher or lower.
[284.74s -> 288.42s]  I don't know. We have to kind of come to a community consensus on this here. I
[289.60s -> 291.60s]  get five vetoes.
[291.96s -> 293.72s]  Guess what?
[293.72s -> 295.96s]  You get five vetoes too.
[296.24s -> 303.52s]  Because if chat is, if chat really wants to skip something and there's a lot of people in the chat saying skip, skip, skip, skip, skip,
[303.52s -> 310.94s]  right? We'll take a general consensus and we'll do a poll. If you vote to veto that means we skip.
[310.94s -> 314.96s]  But I think two minutes is too low if vetoes are in play.
[315.58s -> 324.49s]  Well, that's not gonna work. Well, then I just get five vetoes. Who cares? I'm in control of this shit.
[324.89s -> 332.56s]  So I get five vetoes. I gotta make sure I use them correctly. Five minutes? I think five minutes is too long.
[333.24s -> 344.29s]  Three? Two? How long? What do you think? Five minutes is like as long as entire videos I used to make were. Three minutes?
[344.29s -> 352.46s]  Yeah, three is good. Three is good. That's 180 seconds.
[352.76s -> 363.81s]  So the last, we got a lot of Nancy Drew last time and also this reversed vetoes too, right?
[363.81s -> 366.73s]  If I want to stay for more than three minutes, we're staying for more than three minutes.
[368.76s -> 370.76s]  Also, to make this a little more interesting,
[371.56s -> 374.12s]  there's gonna be a bingo card of
[378.52s -> 383.56s]  various things that have happened over the years. You know what, let's just do this. Let's get over here.
[383.56s -> 388.91s]  I pressed it one time and I will watch it for two minutes, okay? I promise.
[388.91s -> 398.75s]  I want to show the, I want to show the board. We're gonna make it even more interesting. Okay, so here we go.
[399.07s -> 405.08s]  So let's change that to 180. As you see here,
[408.19s -> 415.02s]  a lot of these are very possible. If this shows up on the broadcast,
[415.58s -> 417.58s]  we obviously have to put a stamp on it, right?
[418.14s -> 425.44s]  Like this. And if you get bingo, if bingo, I have big rigs in the background,
[425.44s -> 428.84s]  I know. If you get bingo, then
[429.48s -> 433.64s]  I didn't really think of, I don't know, I'll give a hundred community subs. That sounds easy, right?
[434.91s -> 440.06s]  How about this? I'll give a hundred community subs if you get bingo. I'll give,
[442.17s -> 444.17s]  uh, hold on. How much should I give?
[444.65s -> 453.04s]  How many subs should I give? Let me, hold on. Let me, let me like, think of how like, okay, hold on a minute.
[453.04s -> 462.33s]  What's 250 subs? How much money is that? It's a lot, right? I can't do math in my head. It's
[465.63s -> 468.67s]  1200 bucks. That's 2, 2, 2, 2, 500 dollars.
[471.59s -> 473.77s]  1200 bucks. 1250. Okay. Alright.
[474.99s -> 478.35s]  If you fill the whole board, if we fill the whole board in this stream, by the way,
[478.43s -> 481.95s]  I have to give a time limit on this stream because if we stay here long enough,
[481.95s -> 485.23s]  we're gonna get every, we're gonna fill the whole board in at least three or four hours.
[486.96s -> 493.61s]  Horizontal row four is gonna be so easy. You think so? I don't think do it
[493.61s -> 496.21s]  I don't haven't done doi doi doi that look, okay
[496.21s -> 498.65s]  We'll go over these because I want to make sure this is really really very clear
[498.93s -> 506.10s]  Jack's moment is when I'm playing a game very very well has to be incredibly clear not just like oh you jumped to that
[506.10s -> 512.12s]  Platform correctly. No like a gamer moment where it's like, holy shit. I can't believe you just did that. Look at me
[512.88s -> 514.08s]  poses, you know
[514.08s -> 515.00s]  I don't know
[515.00s -> 519.82s]  You know what I'm talking about and when I put my arms in weird places hog face me know that
[520.75s -> 525.55s]  Rants are fine rants. You know, I just go off and start talking with something my crazy and a rant does not be bringing up
[525.55s -> 532.94s]  Any topic it's a rant ball joke. We all know that that's when I deliberately fall off of a cliff to make everybody laugh and write
[532.94s -> 540.23s]  Lul and make me you know, feel happy character voices any impression or character that I'm doing one guy is you
[540.61s -> 546.32s]  Otto is Otto lich. You don't need a gambling is any gambling on stream
[547.58s -> 555.94s]  It's I'm not gonna say that's like could that be debt oriented. No, I think that's on here, isn't it? No, yeah
[556.26s -> 558.46s]  That is already on here. See debt ordeal
[559.42s -> 561.82s]  Gambling is not debt ordeal as well
[561.82s -> 565.90s]  It has to be like I'm playing blackjack or I'm like gambling on the on stream
[568.93s -> 572.43s]  Naked is when I talk about maybe if I talk about being naked which happens a lot
[573.37s -> 574.69s]  drug
[574.69s -> 581.40s]  It's I don't think that's gonna show up because there's another two years worth of streams
[581.40s -> 585.40s]  It just became way less likely percentage wise that drew crew will show up
[585.44s -> 592.84s]  What else is a could be on here that might be you're saying an emote out loud is another one
[592.88s -> 599.47s]  If TF2 shows up if a wrestling video shows up or if I get scared if you get bingo
[599.75s -> 603.79s]  100 community subs if you fill the whole board in three hours
[603.89s -> 615.42s]  I'll give 250 subs as that's on you just did all I I know but I understand bingo
[615.42s -> 619.02s]  I know what about being high now
[619.02s -> 622.20s]  That's not on here a lot of community members helped with this
[622.32s -> 628.45s]  There's been a couple of iterations kind of just grabbed from a bunch of what people were talking about different mods community members
[628.45s -> 629.99s]  So thank you contributed to this. Thank you
[629.99s -> 638.94s]  It makes the stream that much more fun and I think we can go so can we get him maybe a link to this
[638.98s -> 647.54s]  You probably linked it a few three and a half hours or the deal is off. What no three hours is perfect
[647.62s -> 651.18s]  You know if you want to open it up and play for yourself
[651.18s -> 653.92s]  And if you want to open up so you can scream at me when something happens
[653.98s -> 662.64s]  Are you ready to go through the ages by the way to test it?
[662.64s -> 667.31s]  I was going back and forth with a Luke last night. I've tested it a few times and
[668.25s -> 671.57s]  I landed on really really kind of like cringy TF2 video
[671.57s -> 676.69s]  There was like a live commentary, and I like hated it, so I I'm very ready to use my five vetoes
[680.00s -> 682.28s]  Already I don't I have to be careful though
[682.28s -> 684.28s]  I have to see if I can stomach some of those older videos
[684.56s -> 690.62s]  Because if I can then I can save my vetoes for something very important right all right
[690.74s -> 699.09s]  So let's get this off make sure the timer is correct, okay?
[699.09s -> 705.27s]  So this is three minutes, and I did press it once already, so this is I believe a YouTube video of
[708.36s -> 712.42s]  On the main channel. This is the worst game. This is okay. What's good. Are you ready? I'm ready
[712.64s -> 721.70s]  Let's go in three face cam not yet if you're good three two one go
[721.70s -> 728.28s]  Oh look at how much fun. This is god damn it. That's not a voice hold on. I
[730.00s -> 736.40s]  It's almost a 90-degree angle. I gotta do it that doesn't count
[737.72s -> 739.72s]  That's not a funny. That's I do that
[740.32s -> 745.60s]  Sick Tony Hawk ramp that doesn't count. I'm playing on a half pipe right now. Not a character voice
[745.60s -> 748.04s]  That's me doing me we do like a 720
[748.92s -> 757.00s]  God damn it no already hold on all right funds over go through this is that I'll take game glitch is fine game
[757.00s -> 765.61s]  Which is mine is fucking awful truly truly a disgraceful game. I can't think of anything worse
[765.61s -> 771.37s]  I really can't think of a game. That's that's worse than this okay. This is not a brand no
[771.37s -> 777.21s]  It's not it's not a rant. This is not even a video game. Well here. He's a bridge. No good bridge
[777.53s -> 781.86s]  That was fun. Yeah, it was fun going over or something with no detection on it
[781.88s -> 790.16s]  No, it's not a rant. That's complaining. I don't know man if somebody can tell me in the comment section a game
[790.16s -> 798.85s]  That's worse than this. I would can either go. It's gonna be pretty tough. I can't I can't think of anything not not blow oh
[799.57s -> 805.72s]  No, it's okay. Oh look. There's my buddy. This is yelling. Oh, there's my friend. Hey. Hey, remember when you
[807.05s -> 813.92s]  You are winner. Oh, hey, don't worry guys. You are winner. We'll do random race
[814.28s -> 819.69s]  I want a veto already sounds like fun. No, that's not a voice. That's me going like this
[819.97s -> 825.00s]  That's not a voice. That's me. Just changing my voice to be like funny for a second all right. We're in like in
[825.52s -> 833.98s]  What what three minutes is too long? No, I didn't do any days. Why did I just win the game?
[834.30s -> 843.51s]  It didn't I didn't even have a chance to move what do it again. That was stupid. I don't alright. Thanks for the win
[843.51s -> 849.45s]  I'll take the victory. I'll have my KD go up or my win-loss go up. This is old video
[849.69s -> 851.57s]  What the fuck
[851.57s -> 854.93s]  Stop doing this. Is it how much time is in the video random race?
[854.93s -> 859.33s]  It's not even enough time in the video to get to the end of the time stop giving me the victory automatically
[859.57s -> 861.77s]  This game is trying to tell me to stop playing
[862.65s -> 864.50s]  ready
[864.50s -> 866.50s]  Yeah
[867.96s -> 870.26s]  Right
[871.95s -> 879.54s]  Hold on the the timers look at the video is gonna end all right
[879.54s -> 884.34s]  So we have to go over this because people are freaking out about this no that is not
[884.46s -> 892.98s]  I understand that this is a game glitch right, but no that doesn't count as a voice that doesn't none of that counts
[893.30s -> 911.67s]  Anger does not equal rant. That's correct. That's the prime of your career. I'm not cheating. I'm not sure that doesn't count all right
[913.38s -> 923.71s]  Let's go. Let's go here. We go ready. We're going. Oh shit. I fucked it up all right here
[923.71s -> 931.59s]  We go people out of here. This is the movies whatever the other timer who are these people?
[934.98s -> 941.83s]  Extra extra no we don't want this many extras. This is the movies part one. Are you?
[943.75s -> 946.56s]  Okay, that's fine. That's fine. All right
[947.40s -> 950.48s]  Okay, we're in the bathroom still
[954.16s -> 960.93s]  Somebody enter it somebody here comes the guy with the fucking axe. That's the same lady

[983.39s -> 985.88s]  All right
[986.36s -> 993.82s]  Prop bashing object I could do free space too. I have to group these together, so I don't have to keep pressing this
[996.63s -> 998.63s]  She walks it only two more
[1000.23s -> 1008.29s]  That was I'm gonna hit horror shot crane shot. That's not a laughing fit. No way
[1008.79s -> 1016.56s]  We you know what a laughing fit is here. That's not a movie no
[1016.56s -> 1025.28s]  It's gonna be horror shot to now. Where's the camera during this whole thing dress set?
[1025.60s -> 1031.28s]  There's so much shit to do here. I can't wait to fucking like to spend a million years here remember playing this
[1031.44s -> 1034.08s]  This was so new. Oh god. I missed this shit
[1037.53s -> 1043.68s]  It's just weapons. I wish they would just make another one of these so bad okay
[1044.32s -> 1054.52s]  This is just the intro that's gas lighting you yeah, how do we preview all right?
[1054.52s -> 1058.08s]  Let's all right talking with you in the free camera. Okay free camera
[1058.08s -> 1064.26s]  I wish that make it redo this whole thing and make more intuitive controls
[1068.20s -> 1070.20s]  This is ready for casting
[1075.64s -> 1078.52s]  Maybe I should do those tutorials
[1079.00s -> 1089.62s]  All right, I can stomach this one. I can I just want to see what happens here ready more actors
[1089.78s -> 1099.62s]  Yeah, does not come actor. Where's our nine ten seconds?
[1102.42s -> 1105.62s]  Where the hell come on these are actors man where we going

[1125.08s -> 1134.73s]  This is a Jax moment. I hope not I should have known no. I'm gonna get pissed at this
[1134.73s -> 1137.85s]  I remember being really mad at this shit. Okay. I thought this is horrible
[1138.57s -> 1144.56s]  Yeah, I hated this. What's the fastest way to deal with this?
[1147.62s -> 1153.12s]  And it's a really good show you putting on that. It's in vain
[1153.80s -> 1168.91s]  He just kicked his own his friend one goes down get the other now. That wasn't a voice not even close
[1169.43s -> 1179.05s]  All right guy guy you look like a middle-aged magician. I
[1179.61s -> 1192.44s]  Actually can't believe that work I cannot believe that work
[1193.10s -> 1197.39s]  Not wrestling at all. Not even close nice comedy movie
[1198.09s -> 1200.72s]  If anything, this is gonna be pissed off
[1200.96s -> 1212.77s]  What do you put what game is this? What are your games is are the entire time you've an egomaniac mug?
[1212.77s -> 1217.26s]  I don't know. I'm looking at his hypothesis
[1217.78s -> 1221.68s]  The present from my mother. It's a they cannot hurt me ever
[1222.36s -> 1226.32s]  Just wait for the do that and then they'll eventually hit each other like that
[1227.20s -> 1235.72s]  Stand in the middle and just hold our one wait, they take too long. Yeah, I bought this on my own free will
[1236.28s -> 1238.96s]  Yeah, they're identical. They're a mirror. So they're gonna run into each other
[1243.72s -> 1246.76s]  45 seconds emotion captured real twins
[1248.68s -> 1255.87s]  Why did you play this but not Yakuza I played this I played this like

[1473.98s -> 1477.42s]  Look at the level. This is this is bad. All right, we have to update the bingo board
[1478.93s -> 1487.26s]  Because we had we had something happen there. What was it? I'm gonna give you character voice, right?
[1487.50s -> 1498.59s]  Cuz I mean here comes your the rant free space actually me put free space in now. All right, so hold on
[1498.59s -> 1508.01s]  What are you guys looking for here? So rumor and wrestling that's could happen very I'll reset the timer
[1508.01s -> 1513.34s]  Don't worry. All right. Let me see how like the path of where you can find the best
[1513.98s -> 1520.55s]  Okay, rumor might not happen wrestling might not happen if you get laughing fit and you get rant
[1520.67s -> 1523.89s]  That's gonna be close. It'd be close
[1523.89s -> 1530.47s]  I really don't want to play this because this is like embarrassing because I get this is like actually like a part of this
[1530.47s -> 1532.99s]  This is a stream that I did where I was like pissed out when I turned it off
[1532.99s -> 1538.82s]  I was like, I fucking hated that stream. I fucking hated that game. Well, I love the hitman3, but this level well
[1538.82s -> 1541.38s]  I'm gonna we're gonna do it. I'm sure I veto it. I think I might veto it
[1541.38s -> 1548.18s]  I'm like actually and this is like the surge to like the surge, right? Okay. Here we go. Let's just go
[1548.28s -> 1557.64s]  Good luck. Well, let me group these together because this is gonna be a group
[1557.72s -> 1565.86s]  This is gonna get this gonna start to turn into hell if I don't do this
[1566.42s -> 1570.48s]  Okay, there we go. All right resetting timer and
[1571.10s -> 1593.70s]  Three two one. Let's go. I had to don't sell me the drugs right here. What are you stupid? I save it here
[1593.70s -> 1599.66s]  Okay, thank God. You can listen to the tone of my voice. I'm already upset about something Richard Nixon impression. Sure
[1600.78s -> 1607.62s]  I'm fine. When they're pulling the bus, I bring that snob. It's already on there. It's already on there
[1608.06s -> 1617.06s]  In joke currency fake money, not real one. I'm so predictable. It's just such a joke
[1617.50s -> 1631.21s]  Why does he drop it on the ground? You notice that so give it to me. That's not one guy. No
[1631.85s -> 1634.73s]  Should I?
[1634.81s -> 1640.16s]  You know putting syringe on here wouldn't have been a bad idea
[1640.72s -> 1651.02s]  That's what I wanted to have happen last time good silent. Somebody will hear me if I stab him
[1651.38s -> 1655.94s]  And it ended it down to did it did it did it did it did it down to that?
[1655.94s -> 1659.90s]  I'm not a drug dealer. So now I have to walk up to one of these guys and sell drugs to him
[1659.90s -> 1666.59s]  I think we're yeah, we're missing the part where I go on the rant about it being a concrete level
[1666.59s -> 1672.02s]  Okay, which one of these guys does the drugs saved see if it's you you were really high on this stream
[1672.54s -> 1676.42s]  No, I wasn't actually I was lying to you because I didn't want people to think I was a moron
[1676.42s -> 1681.74s]  I was fucking probably stone-cold sober on this dream as I said
[1681.74s -> 1686.10s]  I was like hi, so people would think I have a moron you you might like
[1686.86s -> 1692.69s]  You think that why wouldn't he he should put on like a like a ever since I started to tell you guys that I
[1692.93s -> 1697.45s]  47 never puts a voice on its character voice is already there every time you disguise. He's just like yes
[1697.45s -> 1702.62s]  I'm here the chef ready to serve you you think if he was an assassin like that
[1702.62s -> 1704.94s]  Why wouldn't you put a voice? He's a liar put a voice on
[1705.46s -> 1708.73s]  Okay, and would you like some drugs?
[1708.97s -> 1715.36s]  Why don't you just speak my normal voice this guy doesn't want any drugs
[1715.36s -> 1717.48s]  I don't think I just do I do so many voices
[1717.48s -> 1720.92s]  I'm probably so annoying to be at it with like a Thanksgiving dinner or like Christmas and shit
[1721.40s -> 1730.70s]  like at some point I've never been recorded and if I'm the most
[1731.46s -> 1734.86s]  Incredible assassin in the world. How do I nobody picked me up?
[1735.54s -> 1743.54s]  Like a microphone in an office complex being like the job is done. I just blew it. There we go. I got too close
[1743.54s -> 1745.30s]  I was talking
[1745.30s -> 1748.67s]  Not mad yet. Oh
[1748.71s -> 1753.29s]  That's right when I shot that person. What is that? That's all right. That's not a rant
[1754.52s -> 1756.32s]  Now oh
[1756.32s -> 1759.64s]  Well, I mean you have like you have like shit
[1759.64s -> 1771.06s]  No, wait, you can order run like three weeks if you want. This is wrestling god damn it. Okay, hold on
[1771.54s -> 1777.30s]  Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Okay, so that's wrestling
[1777.30s -> 1792.88s]  Of course the last three seconds of this fucking video vroom as well when it was not a room
[1792.88s -> 1809.97s]  What are you talking about got scared? You know, I've come to understand something about myself and about this stream
[1810.29s -> 1813.24s]  this is not a bingo card for
[1813.80s -> 1815.80s]  Things that have happened over the last
[1816.42s -> 1827.28s]  Eleven fucking straight years. These are things that happen every stream every single one. So
[1828.69s -> 1835.76s]  Besides big maybe TF2 and maybe special event stream. This is just not a bingo card
[1835.76s -> 1839.24s]  This is just a checklist of things that I'm gonna do every broadcast
[1839.36s -> 1846.77s]  You know, we'll put all on that. I want to watch that. I want to hold on
[1846.77s -> 1854.13s]  I want to watch this video pause the timer. That's what I want to watch. This video is two minutes long
[1854.13s -> 1859.04s]  I just want to see this part. This is one of my first t-shirt ever. I don't give up on a garment
[1859.04s -> 1864.20s]  This is the crew man t-shirt is now available. Yes. That's right glue man
[1864.80s -> 1866.28s]  protector of the innocent
[1866.28s -> 1867.80s]  offender of justice and
[1867.80s -> 1872.08s]  Warden of all that is good and kind has finally caved into marketing
[1872.08s -> 1877.70s]  It doesn't count not to deliver this shirt to you buying this shirt will take you back to moments like these
[1878.10s -> 1883.70s]  Glue man's German wrestling debut as a 22 year old newbie under the stage name G
[1883.70s -> 1884.22s]  Grossi
[1884.22s -> 1891.10s]  He made a real splash in his first match when he was nearly killed by Dogman the magical dog magician
[1892.10s -> 1896.50s]  Was considered at least partially blind each shirt does not
[1897.46s -> 1901.90s]  Get of authenticity. I forgot about this might be what one may have looked like if they did
[1902.26s -> 1906.42s]  Signed and stamped by the father of all contemporary German wrestling
[1906.62s -> 1913.42s]  George our glue man senior himself, which are mine is a true site of craftsmanship and quality and again
[1913.74s -> 1919.78s]  No, you don't get one of these how much does a t-shirt like this cost you ask not?
[1920.28s -> 1923.16s]  12,000 not 8,000 not even
[1924.00s -> 1930.08s]  5,000 tired joke to get your very own glue man t-shirt. You need only one low payment of
[1931.08s -> 1936.68s]  $20 plus shipping and handling a spill joke take pride in owning a piece of German channel history
[1936.88s -> 1938.88s]  brag to all of your friends that we
[1940.20s -> 1944.76s]  Depicted character has been deemed out loud as the worst character ever and
[1945.28s -> 1952.48s]  Useless by the individual who created him these shirts are only available for a limited time and may never be available again
[1952.48s -> 1959.76s]  Yeah, they are head over to the spring comm slash glue man to reserve one today. All links will be in the description
[1960.28s -> 1967.66s]  Yeah, they're available June 2015. Holy shit. That's a long time ago. What a lie
[1967.66s -> 1972.44s]  Well, I said they may they they weren't from 2015 to like
[1973.10s -> 1981.89s]  2019 this shirt was gone. You could not buy it. You're old. Yeah, I know welcome to how old I am
[1981.89s -> 1985.30s]  All right, you're right. Let's keep going. I just want to see that
[1985.30s -> 1991.30s]  I haven't seen that video in like six years or something. Where do we stand?
[1991.50s -> 2001.90s]  All right of rumor ends this whole thing for me. Well, not really but you know, we keep going. All right, let's go
[2002.10s -> 2014.42s]  I'm gonna start the timer back continue to go through the ages. Here we go. Oh shit. Hold on
[2014.58s -> 2033.20s]  This is just the timer settings. Oops. How did I mess this up? How did I mess this up? What the fuck? Oh, there we go
[2033.20s -> 2035.20s]  Okay
[2036.70s -> 2045.78s]  Streaming the Nintendo I got a time camera off. Yeah, it's gonna be every single character. They're just Bayonetta
[2046.30s -> 2054.08s]  I'm not on cam yet, though. It's a special event
[2055.00s -> 2057.16s]  No, it's not. This is it before
[2057.68s -> 2063.44s]  This is like 60 62. This is not a special event. They do one of these every fucking 30 days
[2064.08s -> 2066.08s]  That's not a special event
[2066.80s -> 2073.44s]  This is e3
[2074.08s -> 2076.48s]  I'm telling you if I see Glover, I swear to God
[2077.04s -> 2079.47s]  It should add a Glover. I'll stand by that
[2079.95s -> 2082.87s]  Is it if I've got damn it fine. It's a special event. It is
[2084.54s -> 2086.54s]  Yes, it's e3
[2086.86s -> 2089.61s]  all three Battletoads
[2089.73s -> 2093.76s]  Which is e3
[2093.76s -> 2100.76s]  2018 god damn it. Yeah, okay. That's not just like a Nintendo Direct. This is like e3. I
[2101.32s -> 2108.47s]  Want to what's the announcement though? I wonder please tell me that they just they just unconfirmed Luigi by putting him in an egg
[2109.19s -> 2110.63s]  eternity
[2110.63s -> 2116.71s]  It's not funny. What about this the big reveal? Who's the new character? Who did they reveal in 2018?
[2116.71s -> 2118.71s]  I'm gonna show them. They're gonna zoom in on his face
[2119.39s -> 2122.19s]  There he is
[2122.19s -> 2129.92s]  That's right. Every fighter in Super Smash Brothers history is joining about
[2130.64s -> 2132.88s]  people are gonna think I'm like
[2132.92s -> 2137.44s]  One of these weird twitch channels that just streams random like TV shows and events and stuff
[2140.40s -> 2144.84s]  Why is this channel streaming the 2018 e3
[2148.32s -> 2151.16s]  I'm not vetoing it with 60 seconds left. This is fine
[2157.40s -> 2162.72s]  Even so your starting roster may be as small as the original Nintendo 64 game
[2164.18s -> 2168.78s]  No, new characters conditions for unlocking fighters and we want to make the process interesting
[2168.78s -> 2172.38s]  So I want to know what I have to say about this though. I feel like I have a really shit take on this
[2180.50s -> 2182.99s]  Come on give us unbalanced video game
[2188.51s -> 2190.87s]  What exactly is this frame it's me watching
[2191.35s -> 2193.35s]  4000 hours of videos
[2201.43s -> 2205.15s]  You have shit takes on everything no, I don't what about what I said about peanut butter
[2205.55s -> 2209.31s]  Link dawns as champions tunic from the legend of Zelda breath of the wild
[2210.03s -> 2214.71s]  His bombs are now remotely detonated and his final smash. We're going on
[2215.27s -> 2221.09s]  Way so they still haven't fixed this because I've tried to go back to direct x9
[2221.09s -> 2226.81s]  No, no, I was gonna do these commentaries. I tried it still didn't work. I still was getting terrible frames per second
[2226.85s -> 2228.85s]  I've tried everything so
[2229.33s -> 2234.85s]  Don't leave a comment telling me to change my video drivers or something cuz I've already done it
[2235.49s -> 2238.77s]  So I come up behind this heavy get him with the backs. I'm gonna beat on this one
[2238.77s -> 2240.77s]  I don't want to talk about another tip
[2240.97s -> 2244.41s]  Look at what I have equipped right now as my disguise as a medic
[2244.41s -> 2246.41s]  I'm using the bone saw right now
[2246.41s -> 2252.21s]  You can switch what we're just holding out of the skies if you hit B while you're holding your different weapons
[2252.69s -> 2255.13s]  Too many spies walk around if they're just guys
[2255.13s -> 2261.81s]  Let's just say you're disguised as the back words if you're walking around with a syringe gun out as the medic as your disguise
[2262.61s -> 2268.61s]  People are gonna know you're a spy because what medic walks around with his syringe gun when there's no enemies around exactly
[2268.65s -> 2270.65s]  So make sure you're aware of the different items
[2274.05s -> 2276.05s]  So me and this sniper are going toe-to-toe
[2277.29s -> 2280.05s]  No, actually what happened was fucked up
[2280.97s -> 2284.33s]  Somehow you killed that guy and this revolver is really really fun to use
[2284.33s -> 2288.45s]  It's really really powerful the whole point for me coming back here was to take off the teleporter
[2288.45s -> 2292.87s]  I figured it was gonna take too long for the sapper and I was right because look at these people coming out to try
[2292.87s -> 2297.67s]  And get me I get away with my life intact and I decloak right behind this rock
[2297.71s -> 2303.39s]  Like I told you before this is fine fantastic for decloaking because look nobody seems to know or care
[2303.99s -> 2306.31s]  so I'm following this line of people and
[2307.15s -> 2311.07s]  This is where the dead ringer shines as you'll see in the next second or two here
[2311.19s -> 2316.11s]  Get this engineer get the sentry gun pull out the dead ringer guys run behind everybody
[2316.11s -> 2317.95s]  You know, you're just gonna die and use it
[2317.95s -> 2322.07s]  Don't be afraid to take something out to give some get on to every single person again
[2322.07s -> 2325.07s]  I didn't make this video like two weekends ago
[2325.71s -> 2329.87s]  Come right back. I made this video before the game. I think was free
[2331.47s -> 2334.83s]  12 years ago or something row I get this engineer
[2334.83s -> 2338.63s]  Of course, like this is gonna be outdated in medic and the heavy he was healing
[2338.91s -> 2341.33s]  Pull it out Brinson repeat again
[2341.71s -> 2346.55s]  That's the best part about the dead ringer is if you have a set route pretty much
[2346.91s -> 2353.75s]  Plan out a route you're gonna take and just do it every single time people are very very ignorant to dead ringer spies
[2353.91s -> 2356.47s]  They never check and they always lose their ground
[2357.55s -> 2361.83s]  So I get that sniper I get this scout pull the dead ringer out. We turn around
[2362.35s -> 2365.59s]  We try and do it again. Fuck this and John knows
[2366.07s -> 2368.73s]  Video I'm vetoing starting to wise up a little coffee everywhere
[2369.39s -> 2375.43s]  Dammit right behind these rocks. Oh, this sucks. Awesome. Oh fuck this video come up here
[2375.43s -> 2382.57s]  I'm jumping doesn't work so clean and right here is a totally totally horribly embarrassing things stop talking
[2382.73s -> 2388.25s]  I got a beer back. I actually have to bear back. I swear to God. I'm not kidding. I'll be right back
[2388.25s -> 2397.74s]  I'll be just one second. I guess I gotta clean this up before it stains
[2419.75s -> 2505.18s]  I'm not even muted. Whoops. All right, it's coming up. It's coming up. I just give me another minute
[2505.18s -> 2612.09s]  I think I'm okay. It's coming up. Damn it. I've been so good about keeping this area so clean
[2612.69s -> 2615.41s]  Then I dump up fucking coffee on the ground
[2620.69s -> 2622.69s]  Swinging a spy around
[2622.85s -> 2627.25s]  Mocking my past self. It's like yeah. Yeah. All right. Wait, let's go
[2627.89s -> 2643.19s]  Finish the stream hurry up. I want to play terraria. You just put me in a tab man. Oh, that's all right
[2643.19s -> 2659.17s]  Just put me in a tab. I we got to update the bingo card, which goodness. Okay, we have some new additions
[2663.44s -> 2675.06s]  TF2 this is actually filling up Jax to really because I got like three four kills in a row
[2675.26s -> 2683.62s]  All right, I guess that makes sense. Yeah
[2683.62s -> 2688.38s]  No, like okay getting three backstabs in a row is spy in 2011
[2688.38s -> 2691.08s]  I mean
[2691.08s -> 2697.32s]  Okay, this is important too. This was right after they changed the knife to be instant instead of it taking a full second to swing
[2697.44s -> 2708.18s]  That's not a Jax moment. Yeah, I disagree. I disagree right after this changed back in like 2010 2011
[2708.34s -> 2712.98s]  spy was insane for like a month or two straight because nobody was used to the fact that it took
[2713.42s -> 2720.04s]  Less than less than a second to stab somebody in the back, but I will give you the special event
[2720.08s -> 2724.60s]  Oh, no, I just have to say that by the way, this doesn't count
[2724.60s -> 2732.03s]  I'm just giving you a reference when I say something like monkey ass or like a pog jam like yeah that
[2732.19s -> 2736.66s]  This is gonna end pretty quickly. I think all right
[2737.66s -> 2739.66s]  let's put the time to get the timer back here and
[2745.83s -> 2753.38s]  Continue in three two one we move
[2753.70s -> 2759.82s]  Like five people guaranteed if he has more than a few shots and he can land them far too often
[2759.82s -> 2763.70s]  I'll see engineers standing by their sentry guns with the glowing bright shotgun
[2764.02s -> 2766.02s]  Just doing nothing
[2766.06s -> 2769.60s]  I'm gonna be I feel like if you start to heal those people and tell them over Mike
[2769.74s -> 2772.84s]  Hey, how many revenge crits do you have? Oh, I got
[2773.70s -> 2778.54s]  17 hey you want to go kill the whole team right now. It's like I'm no brainers
[2778.54s -> 2783.46s]  I have five videos right there that was me building the sentry gun and it took about 30 seconds
[2783.46s -> 2785.26s]  Maybe it's nothing happened. I didn't die
[2785.26s -> 2788.74s]  It was just really boring so I didn't didn't want to have you guys have to sit through that
[2788.94s -> 2791.58s]  But killing that sniper right there and people freak out
[2791.58s -> 2795.22s]  I've said this before in other gameplay commentaries that when you get hit by a crit
[2795.22s -> 2800.26s]  What is it you get shot in your stomach breaking record whether it's a rocket whether it's a shotgun doesn't matter
[2800.54s -> 2806.30s]  You freak out a little bit, and you go. Okay. There's crits. I gotta run by oh by the way one shot kill right there
[2806.50s -> 2811.42s]  You sound like an asshole what I mean right when you see a crit scree when a medic pops a crit scree
[2811.42s -> 2816.92s]  I don't somebody and their weapons are glowing you immediately go here comes crits
[2816.92s -> 2822.06s]  I'm gonna die the same thing can be said about somebody that has a frontier justice
[2822.06s -> 2824.38s]  That's glowing even when I'm not playing engineer
[2824.38s -> 2830.06s]  I could be playing soldier or I could be playing spy this is not if I see the glowing shotgun I go
[2830.34s -> 2837.77s]  Your aim omega low shit, and I either back up or I go for another target. That's what goes through everybody's mind
[2837.81s -> 2844.17s]  So this is the second century that's built to completion now get a few kills that spy was 90 seconds ringer
[2844.53s -> 2849.61s]  Always tell when a spy's a dead ringer when you shoot them one time from far away, and it does two damage
[2849.61s -> 2854.25s]  But it magically kills them so dead ringer spies. I do that too though everybody does that
[2855.37s -> 2861.65s]  So I got four kills on this century, and I kind of do something really really outrageous tips and
[2862.17s -> 2866.53s]  Not recommended to most people that are playing engineer because we have this one point
[2866.53s -> 2869.05s]  We only have three minutes to go and I
[2869.85s -> 2873.97s]  Destroy the century to get the crits. I'm such a greedy bastard
[2874.73s -> 2879.49s]  Bad idea. This is a good idea. Yeah, let me just destroy the century you put it immediately quick enough
[2879.49s -> 2886.49s]  You can get a century built back to complete. Oh, yeah quickly especially when I have that dispenser right there a full level three dispenser
[2886.49s -> 2889.69s]  I'm not worried about it at all right now. I'm just curious
[2889.69s -> 2895.11s]  I want to try and look around try and get some more kills soldier right in his face 180 damage remember how I said that before
[2895.69s -> 2900.03s]  180 looking around perusing seeing if I can get a shot on somebody get a kill
[2900.03s -> 2904.45s]  I miss a few times, but I get the kill on him anyways from long-range crit guys
[2904.45s -> 2909.93s]  Don't be afraid to do this if you're afraid to do this if you think you need to stand by your century at all times
[2909.93s -> 2911.61s]  And I go for life
[2911.61s -> 2916.49s]  I mean that's true, but it's not true enough where you can't go have a little bit of fun
[2916.89s -> 2922.13s]  Remember a spy is gonna try and backstab you and take out your century and all your buildings
[2922.13s -> 2927.66s]  So what happens if a spy just saps all that stuff right now the map is small enough where I'm gonna be able to get
[2927.66s -> 2932.18s]  Back to at least one or two of my buildings preferably the dispenser or maybe even the century
[2932.22s -> 2940.10s]  It's really not we're going go go go I need to like feed this guy drugs, so he doesn't die surgeon simulator almost almost
[2941.16s -> 2947.54s]  Come on all right. Where's the syringe? We are just there. Yes. I played the funny
[2948.58s -> 2954.00s]  YouTuber games when they came out yes, yes
[2954.48s -> 2960.80s]  We're good. We are good. Just need to cool it here. I'm vetoing this don't want to lose the hearts right here
[2960.80s -> 2966.00s]  Oh, you already know what this whole video is fly out the back. No, I'm video heart. We don't hurt for the time being
[2966.40s -> 2968.12s]  Okay, the doors are closed
[2968.12s -> 2975.31s]  Vito damn done Vito. I think anybody's gonna do this. I think I just wasted like two hours of my time
[2975.83s -> 2979.36s]  Would you do it? I would never do this no this video is awesome actually
[2980.64s -> 2982.64s]  Except for this guy except for this guy
[2983.28s -> 2988.96s]  Please be the only brainless motherfucker in here. That's gonna. Do this watch the shit. He's doing it follow him down. Oh
[2990.04s -> 2992.04s]  He's gonna crash into people
[2992.08s -> 2994.51s]  It's if you're alive
[2995.25s -> 2999.03s]  He's making it into the pool. I love this video was a lot fun to make it in the pool
[2999.73s -> 3001.61s]  It's safe. It works
[3001.61s -> 3006.22s]  Come on. Let's go
[3007.45s -> 3008.77s]  all joke
[3008.77s -> 3014.57s]  Yeah number two I gotta get a good view of this. It's already there though. This is too long sitting here waiting for this
[3014.57s -> 3017.11s]  Here we go. Let's see what he does. See ya
[3018.51s -> 3024.20s]  He made it he made it yeah
[3025.64s -> 3027.64s]  McLeod music
[3027.76s -> 3029.76s]  We all used it man anybody else
[3030.16s -> 3031.40s]  Anybody else
[3031.40s -> 3039.39s]  Pause it see he is about to jump off this high dive right now, and he thinks he's going in the pool
[3039.65s -> 3042.82s]  Well, what we're gonna. Do is we're going to replace
[3044.94s -> 3050.62s]  Let's replace a is evil part of this pool that he's about to dive into with you know just just like that
[3050.62s -> 3059.70s]  Let's just see what happens. Let's see how it happens to this guy. Oh, don't tell me you wouldn't do it either
[3060.02s -> 3062.90s]  Yeah, you would do the same thing. Yeah, there he goes
[3067.59s -> 3071.43s]  What where's this kid right there?
[3073.15s -> 3078.51s]  Are you serious? You're completely fine after that. I'm not hungry
[3079.15s -> 3087.02s]  He's fine. All he has to say is I'm hungry coming through
[3087.90s -> 3094.50s]  Beach hut was really good value. I'm not that hungry right now. He's shocked by his own video jumped off of a
[3095.34s -> 3097.74s]  5,000 foot platform into the ground
[3098.30s -> 3104.52s]  Got right. What are you fucking spider-man? I made this feel like nine years ago. I don't remember. Oh shit
[3104.52s -> 3109.22s]  We're at the end. That was a good one. I like that one at the timer doesn't matter for this one
[3111.19s -> 3119.50s]  Are we good? We updated? Yeah, we're up did no bingo yet
[3121.82s -> 3128.02s]  No, you'll know when it's actually rant. You'll know we won't even have to have an argument
[3128.02s -> 3136.80s]  We won't we won't even have to talk about it. It'll be so so obvious. All right, let me uh, let's go
[3136.80s -> 3155.49s]  You ready the timer reset and let's go. Okay, the end of this video the last one second. Okay, let's keep going
[3155.73s -> 3166.58s]  You're one almost done solar system, which this is a Stardew Valley stream or tonight
[3166.62s -> 3180.14s]  I'm gonna make a couple more planets. Holy shit. This is old. I can't believe I'm actually doing that by the way veto
[3180.58s -> 3185.42s]  Why these bat wings to sell for a lot? I remember correctly
[3186.10s -> 3189.66s]  Let's just go. I'm not wasting a video. I already have I've had four vetoes left
[3189.66s -> 3196.64s]  I'm gonna waste a video on this. Oh god. I don't care how boring this part of the enemies
[3196.64s -> 3198.64s]  I'm not wasting too many people down here
[3198.64s -> 3205.03s]  We have a video want to die down the well gonna have to vote for that. You have to vote for it
[3205.99s -> 3214.69s]  Geez, I hate these little dust mites to the worst. They're too erratic
[3214.85s -> 3220.21s]  The stream sucks. Hey Stardew Valley is like where I started. Okay on like streaming on twitch
[3220.73s -> 3231.20s]  Anymore food eat this I'm gonna have to go down here. It's like one of the best video games ever made
[3231.20s -> 3233.24s]  You know, it's a fishing pole
[3233.24s -> 3235.56s]  Scared the shit out of me. I thought that something happened to me
[3236.28s -> 3238.45s]  Why did I have that selected?
[3238.69s -> 3247.12s]  What a fun game. I love boring Andy. I was in tear look
[3247.60s -> 3251.64s]  You do understand it's everything we could get me sitting there
[3251.84s -> 3258.40s]  You could get like the credits of the stream and I would have to stay there like you might get like the end credits
[3258.40s -> 3263.24s]  It's of a random stream. It's very possible. But truth be told. This is the most enemies
[3263.24s -> 3265.66s]  I think I've seen in the game so far in one room. Whoa
[3266.18s -> 3269.54s]  What if we got a veto dwarf scroll to I already got dwarf scroll three
[3269.72s -> 3275.06s]  That's a worst version of the spell that I are. No, look at all these knows. I ain't going anywhere
[3275.24s -> 3287.72s]  Look at all these knows that one looks different. Is it gonna explode? You know, I mean look he's doing the he's doing the thing
[3287.72s -> 3292.20s]  That all enemies do right before they blow up this 50 seconds left where it doesn't take that long
[3292.48s -> 3301.49s]  So weird and like just looking into like a sword with telescope into the past weird
[3301.65s -> 3309.30s]  How come my voice got higher? Please be better than my broken Trident new microphone and I aged 10 years
[3309.30s -> 3314.96s]  I think the speed is cool. You know, this weird thing happens when you get older your body changes
[3315.68s -> 3318.92s]  You don't stay like 25 for your entire life. This is a stab
[3319.56s -> 3323.64s]  You you age a little your vocal cords to get a little different you get a little gravelly
[3324.28s -> 3332.92s]  You microphone settings might change. That's it. Plus two speed and second actually making me faster
[3332.92s -> 3344.14s]  I can't tell where we're going. Where we're going. You see no ink part two. This is a banger. I know that for a fact
[3361.70s -> 3364.96s]  Okay, guys, oh
[3364.96s -> 3376.72s]  This part to pasta ataliado. They all go and start like a war at the restaurant. This game is so good
[3377.00s -> 3382.37s]  We've got a corner the chef market this game this was the funnest thing I've ever done
[3382.63s -> 3387.56s]  You need to extend the time for this one because then I'll be the only restaurant
[3387.82s -> 3397.55s]  Isn't no the casino games are there but I'm not playing it's a heavily guarded fortress
[3397.93s -> 3411.48s]  This is an RTS now. Why somebody on the ground your hit man. Okay top tip this okay
[3411.68s -> 3419.30s]  This was nominated for like best dreams of the year last year, right? People loved this. I did too
[3419.30s -> 3427.44s]  Oh, they're all in. Okay. Wait, maybe we should extend. Okay, let's extend this this part
[3428.16s -> 3433.24s]  Your hit man, everybody's here Peter Baldwin
[3434.25s -> 3441.53s]  Mr. Hoffman, mr. Nolte, mr. Bingham Paul Srebling
[3442.60s -> 3445.35s]  So many people here
[3445.39s -> 3460.82s]  Madison doesn't somebody like just start attacking is all stand over here
[3461.10s -> 3465.14s]  They like burn this place down like five times. Don't they without me doing anything?
[3473.33s -> 3475.33s]  Oh who cares I
[3475.41s -> 3480.38s]  Don't think right now besides wait, I think they getting keen on this
[3480.38s -> 3486.28s]  Oh, they have a security guard there, right? How one of your staff has died
[3487.00s -> 3490.57s]  All right, who's gonna take the shot? Who's gonna make the first shot here?
[3490.57s -> 3496.65s]  I remember just being in a different room or something just hearing that through the mic
[3496.65s -> 3504.66s]  It's just like what the fuck is going on. All right. All right, mr. Jurgens. Mr. Jurgens. It's all hit men
[3504.66s -> 3515.81s]  Oh, yeah, we were taking out their restaurant chef bako is in your sights. Mr. Jurgens fire
[3516.81s -> 3519.75s]  But oh my god
[3529.34s -> 3535.30s]  How many am I putting down
[3535.38s -> 3537.38s]  Oh
[3559.66s -> 3563.15s]  I want to raise
[3563.15s -> 3566.40s]  By the way, this is like if you've never played casino, Inc
[3566.92s -> 3573.50s]  Get out. This is like one of the best games ever made. It's so fun. It's so much fun
[3574.02s -> 3576.02s]  It's the most absurd fucking game ever
[3576.50s -> 3579.94s]  No, no more hitmen stop coming in
[3581.22s -> 3587.10s]  That laughing fit like if a chef walked out that fucking door if a chef comes out that door then
[3587.70s -> 3591.86s]  Then this is owned by a trillionaire. Let me matter
[3593.34s -> 3594.86s]  Not quite
[3594.86s -> 3598.40s]  If a fucking chef opens this door
[3598.96s -> 3610.38s]  Does it happen? I don't remember. Can we extend to find out? I'm curious
[3613.98s -> 3622.82s]  Oh, no, they all just go in the elevator, right?
[3625.23s -> 3627.23s]  So many people in that elevator
[3632.60s -> 3643.38s]  Extend no, no, we're not just gonna extend this one over and over again. We have we have a hundred and seventy days
[3644.12s -> 3666.25s]  Straight 24 hour periods of videos to see so this is good. What was this guy doing? All right, we're going let's go
[3666.25s -> 3670.98s]  Let's go. Come on
[3693.36s -> 3698.01s]  I was in retaliation. It was the old guy
[3707.50s -> 3709.80s]  He took like seven shots
[3714.13s -> 3721.15s]  I'll include it. All right. All right. All right
[3721.15s -> 3726.14s]  I
[3729.42s -> 3731.42s]  Remember this place I just attacked this place
[3731.98s -> 3734.82s]  And they got back to normal and they started a fire again
[3734.94s -> 3739.54s]  Those who they didn't see this dream that this restaurant was on fire two days a week
[3739.74s -> 3741.74s]  They burnt this place down two days a week. It was
[3746.69s -> 3748.69s]  All right
[3748.73s -> 3751.57s]  He just walked in all right
[3765.44s -> 3769.28s]  So that is like this is not bingo, right? Oh, I don't think so not yet
[3770.16s -> 3774.62s]  Where's laughing fit?
[3774.66s -> 3778.06s]  Damn it. You're getting close. You're getting really close in God
[3782.40s -> 3785.24s]  Naked of rumor saying an emote out loud
[3787.96s -> 3793.40s]  Text oh one of your staff is dead. What? What are you talking about?
[3795.12s -> 3797.12s]  One of your staff is dead again
[3798.12s -> 3806.34s]  Gambling no, I have to gamble. It's not what it's not just a gambling on the screen. It's me gambling different. All right, let's go
[3806.86s -> 3811.90s]  razor death at her
[3811.90s -> 3818.12s]  Wrestling shit is gone. And here comes next already on there
[3818.64s -> 3824.14s]  Next is number 12 almost to the halfway point which what year is this? Oh German short 2k 18
[3824.60s -> 3831.36s]  That's clothesline not over-the-top ropes, but just barely into this is like the chat meme rumble right two planets in here
[3831.36s -> 3835.70s]  And remember the planets are in here just to make this more difficult for the shit memes
[3836.22s -> 3840.77s]  Remember. Yeah. All right. This is really important to remember if a planet wins
[3840.77s -> 3845.11s]  Yeah, there you go laughing about it a little bit just a small amount just eliminated German Jupiter
[3845.98s -> 3850.26s]  Who's this? Who's this gets that much easier for one of these shit memes to stay alive?
[3852.08s -> 3855.48s]  Who's the guy with the green hat and number 13? I?
[3857.57s -> 3862.37s]  Didn't say an emo who's still in it who still could be talking about no
[3862.37s -> 3868.70s]  I didn't time to leave what I say for sure. Maybe persevere through this whole thing turbo late
[3868.70s -> 3875.91s]  Oh, what the hood stay and persevere through the whole thing or could he just get eliminated by himself?
[3875.91s -> 3879.63s]  I'm gonna I'm gonna play semantics here with you and there goes German Saturn. The planets are gone
[3880.35s -> 3884.41s]  There are only I believe two more planets never mind
[3884.97s -> 3890.21s]  German getting as far up on the ropes as he can like I said previously and German late is might get it next in here
[3890.29s -> 3892.01s]  He does not
[3892.01s -> 3899.62s]  Okay, oh, that's not true. He's got a huge gross foot in his mouth. Okay stops it pre no no no no no
[3899.62s -> 3905.20s]  He's gonna reverse it now. He's spinning around hundreds ups big belly to back suplex stick around. I'm doing at the end of the stream
[3906.26s -> 3914.34s]  Somebody saved the planet pile driver that move is illegal bingo German just did a move that has been banned since 2002
[3914.94s -> 3920.14s]  You understand that's how fucked up and angry and that's just yes, right? Yeah, it's fine. It counts

[4066.72s -> 4077.03s]  Trying to wonder where this would fit. I just know it will so all right now from here. I gotta go the origin of the sub sound
[4077.71s -> 4082.75s]  that's from Monster Rancher that is one of the sounds a monster makes and
[4083.59s -> 4086.35s]  Everyone thought it was really funny because it sounded like
[4087.43s -> 4089.43s]  Tim the tool man
[4090.43s -> 4094.57s]  Oh
[4094.57s -> 4098.53s]  That was a kind of funny. I just became the sub sound for like three four years

[4663.08s -> 4674.25s]  You said one guy no, it has to be a reference to one guy in the chat. I stuck here forever
[4674.25s -> 4676.25s]  I need to like leave this building
[4676.69s -> 4685.99s]  Get me out of here. I'm stuck here forever. I can't leave this game. I'm decent. I just I have no memory of this

[4698.99s -> 4703.75s]  Dick shot purgatory. That's what we are. I can't get out
[4704.61s -> 4707.84s]  There has to be like an exit right like to the kitchen
[4710.66s -> 4713.30s]  Stupid what am I supposed to do? How do I get out of this?
[4714.10s -> 4722.64s]  Like a second running from me. I don't know. I can't tell I
[4723.32s -> 4728.74s]  Don't even know what's going on. This is never ending enemies. I need to escape. What the fuck?
[4729.42s -> 4743.99s]  I'd play the whole thing and probably how far into the okay. This is 39 minutes into it. Oh boy. This ends in 20 minutes

[4750.27s -> 4754.82s]  Finally stream this game for an hour. I don't think I need I think I need to kill everybody
[4754.82s -> 4760.94s]  I don't think there is an exit. There's no way
[4769.45s -> 4776.49s]  This is okay, which I think I found the secret called zombie staircase
[4781.52s -> 4786.64s]  We're good, I think this is one of the Xbox 360

[5310.03s -> 5317.67s]  What what why you just kill random crits?
[5318.23s -> 5320.55s]  What I'm so confused right now from that
[5321.19s -> 5329.76s]  Ten seconds, here we go. No, that's the death of accidental Jax. That's not a real Jax scout on the point scout on point
[5330.32s -> 5332.06s]  Scatter the black
[5332.06s -> 5335.52s]  Screw it. Oh
[5335.76s -> 5338.12s]  It's gonna get scooped up there
[5338.36s -> 5343.46s]  This is this is gonna be a ramp for sure. I remember this everyone called me an idiot
[5346.18s -> 5356.04s]  Up here, okay, then it goes that way that's going fast
[5357.08s -> 5361.56s]  This game was a lot of fun though. I like this
[5364.47s -> 5369.88s]  Ah
[5369.88s -> 5375.93s]  Smarties are great. Yeah, they're very delicious if you eat them. I wouldn't put them anywhere else
[5376.45s -> 5387.83s]  I've done this like some such a nervous habit. I remember reading the chat and people saying like can't even solve a simple puzzle like seriously
[5387.83s -> 5389.55s]  Dude, I'm like actually worried about you
[5389.55s -> 5393.31s]  Like I'm worried about you do like no, we're not fucking around and I got like pissed
[5393.31s -> 5399.37s]  I think I get actually pissed here. Hopefully doesn't happen in the next minute too. Oh, it's exhausting pretending
[5400.17s -> 5406.19s]  Scoop it already. Come on, man
[5407.47s -> 5409.17s]  Again
[5409.17s -> 5421.36s]  Come on. Where'd he go? I think I'm in the clear though. Shit. I think I fucked it up again
[5421.36s -> 5428.96s]  I think it's like another two or three minutes after this at least because I was here for like 30 minutes. Hey
[5439.32s -> 5441.32s]  Extend it
[5441.36s -> 5446.32s]  I'm just giving you a free space if I do that. All right fine
[5446.84s -> 5456.40s]  You get your reverse veto. This is number two, by the way. I'm her officially extended whole damn thing
[5456.80s -> 5463.36s]  That's your second veto and it's all it accounts for a reverse veto as well. So you only have three more of these left
[5477.62s -> 5480.30s]  Now here we go, this is once I start getting quiet I
[5480.90s -> 5482.74s]  Start talking like this
[5482.74s -> 5484.74s]  What happened? What's going on? Like what the fuck?
[5484.90s -> 5487.10s]  That's the focus whenever you hear me start to do that
[5487.10s -> 5492.40s]  That's when like, you know that I'm probably read off camera and I'm looking over here like right here and I see
[5492.92s -> 5497.41s]  Like holy shit. I did this in fucking 10 seconds actually is the one this dude's a fucking idiot
[5497.41s -> 5501.97s]  Like this dude sucks. Like how does he have this many viewers and shit? Like when I start to see that I'm just like
[5509.66s -> 5517.88s]  You start to laugh it off a little bit and then once it once you realize that you don't know what you're actually doing and
[5517.88s -> 5519.32s]  everybody else does
[5519.32s -> 5522.46s]  You start to like stamp your feet like a little baby
[5525.08s -> 5559.80s]  Go I got this is the one got it. It's not the one
[5562.00s -> 5567.42s]  What an idiot holy shit. Oh my god seeing that again was fucking so bad
[5567.76s -> 5577.58s]  But like it's a big hole to fit it in. I've holy shit. I really thought that's what you did Wow
[5578.28s -> 5580.28s]  But I come on anybody could have made that mistake
[5580.96s -> 5592.74s]  Okay, I thought the arrows we're talking about like I like you like tilt this tilt it
[5592.74s -> 5598.75s]  Well, look, you got to tilt it around and get it in the middle those old stupid toys
[5598.75s -> 5602.25s]  I thought it was like till tell there to tilt it around just get a bit in the middle. I didn't
[5607.06s -> 5612.42s]  I think I fall off here too and it escalates. Alright, I'm gonna give you another extend. I'll give you one more for free
[5612.42s -> 5617.66s]  Oh, I'll give you another one for free
[5618.06s -> 5623.43s]  Shit, I I thought it was just like oh get it in the hole
[5624.23s -> 5629.27s]  Didn't he say get it in that hole too. Can you say something like that? Like, oh make sure you get it in the hole
[5630.39s -> 5633.15s]  Can you say that?
[5633.15s -> 5646.97s]  You fell off. Yeah, I think I think at this point when I mess this up again, what's that?
[5656.65s -> 5664.20s]  Solved the puzzle it took a touch. No wait for 12 or 1 2 2 5
[5667.32s -> 5671.20s]  Or 1 2 2 5 what's going on? Oh
[5673.80s -> 5678.88s]  That's right some we did an elaborate thing where I like made people go skip around the Vaude and shit, right?
[5678.88s -> 5688.34s]  I have completely forgot about that. We did the Vaude puzzle. Oh, yeah
[5688.98s -> 5693.91s]  Why did I pull the controller out I
[5697.03s -> 5701.99s]  Specifically remember everybody hating this bit. I thought it was genius and everybody's like this sucks
[5701.99s -> 5705.91s]  Dude, who just play the game. I was putting like little clues and hints
[5707.15s -> 5710.55s]  To like get go to a specific point in the Vaude, right?
[5710.55s -> 5715.05s]  It was four hours in like in like 12 seconds or something, right and like the whole idea
[5716.71s -> 5718.71s]  Yeah, like it
[5719.19s -> 5721.19s]  Was funny as a Vaude watcher. Yeah
[5722.17s -> 5728.25s]  Screaming on here
[5729.35s -> 5748.84s]  No, it's not. We're good. Congratulations. We're good. By the way, uh, I just did that into my chair
[5757.75s -> 5764.28s]  I don't know why yeah, I got up. I put my face directly into the bottom of the chair
[5764.28s -> 5769.24s]  I don't want to scream because that's way too loud. I'm like, I got a muffle in some
[5770.24s -> 5779.32s]  Yeah, it was it was gross. I realized it it was fucking vile. I think I'm in the clear
[5779.32s -> 5781.32s]  We're not extending it again. We're good
[5782.88s -> 5784.88s]  You ate your own ass
[5785.74s -> 5795.03s]  All right, where we going? No, we're not extending you got to see at least that part. Let's go. Where is it?
[5796.33s -> 5798.89s]  Into the stars and torn into a thousand pieces
[5799.13s -> 5806.32s]  But if this spell was intended to destroy it does not you are caught three stars and held this is it
[5806.32s -> 5810.38s]  I love this game
[5810.54s -> 5819.77s]  What an amazing game come on, by the way, if nobody if you have not played sorcery, it's on everything. It's on
[5820.43s -> 5823.23s]  Ios Android steam everything. No
[5823.95s -> 5826.94s]  Jesus Christ

[5872.85s -> 5875.86s]  Yeah, but there's nothing to Rez
[5876.38s -> 5883.31s]  There are four sorcery games. I know that was what I needed to do. They're so good too. I want to scroll up
[5883.31s -> 5887.37s]  I think the fourth one's probably the worst. No rewinds. Didn't it say like oh you're held in the stars
[5887.37s -> 5891.05s]  It was correct. The fourth one has a bunch of weird shit that you have to do, right?
[5891.09s -> 5894.05s]  But like the sorcery one two and seven a lot of three are
[5895.67s -> 5899.43s]  Phenomenal spellify. It's just telling me that okay, so it was it's doc

[6047.84s -> 6050.83s]  But what the fuck did you want?

[6058.91s -> 6064.15s]  They're right back at you dickhead. But anyway, I am the only person working here
[6064.15s -> 6069.55s]  I know singing my boss is a cheap son of a bitch. He's not gonna hire anybody else. I'm doing the books
[6069.55s -> 6075.31s]  I'm doing the cashier and I'm doing the cooking. How fucked up is this right?
[6075.51s -> 6080.71s]  Wow, that is pretty fucked up. That's terrible. I don't like what where'd all the other workers?
[6082.64s -> 6085.20s]  Seriously, all this game has taught me is
[6085.96s -> 6090.72s]  How much it sucks to work in the restaurant business like I don't ever want to do this
[6090.72s -> 6098.26s]  I never want a restaurant job in my life because how fucking awful this is and I give two thumbs up to
[6098.56s -> 6103.24s]  Anybody that is doing a restaurant job ten years ago, and if you'll excuse me for one second
[6104.51s -> 6115.91s]  What is this yes, I would like two large cheese pizzas and I want them crispy on the bottom

[6121.03s -> 6125.55s]  And I also want some free drinks too. Otherwise, I'm gonna complain to your boss
[6126.59s -> 6127.67s]  I

[6249.37s -> 6252.77s]  I heard you or something. That's weird. He's stupid. Look, he's stupid
[6253.33s -> 6259.52s]  Shut up. I'm mad at him. Like I'm fucking annoyed with him right now. Is that weird?
[6259.56s -> 6264.83s]  Weird thing to say I like I'm pissed off at what I just said. I'm annoyed by that. All right

[6287.73s -> 6293.21s]  Take rants off the deer in the water. Okay, that's that's fair because that was not me ranting
[6293.21s -> 6299.02s]  That was the character grandpa ranting, right? I mean one more pie the rant was
[6299.60s -> 6304.00s]  I feel like it's just five rant, but that was not necessarily me ranting
[6304.00s -> 6314.44s]  The rant has to come from turning the rant was a bit. Okay. All right. Well, let's get this off
[6317.86s -> 6326.56s]  Okay frog detective this is really fun as it was frog stick three out what I know that we're doing another one more thing

[6378.60s -> 6384.12s]  Yeah, look at how much the crowd just looks like utter shit, by the way
[6384.12s -> 6393.58s]  I don't remember any crowd being like sepia tone in my life. I hold on. I might be able to pull this out
[6393.58s -> 6397.50s]  I'm able to pull this through. I feel like we've already seen the whole video a little spin kick
[6397.50s -> 6402.64s]  I think we've seen the whole video already. This is like the tutorial. Oh
[6405.07s -> 6408.87s]  Jim it Jim it I got it. All right

[6418.18s -> 6421.34s]  So match to sepia, right? Look at my health
[6424.31s -> 6429.91s]  Why did I stop with that though health sepia? That's correct. We time. Oh, that's sepia
[6435.24s -> 6437.40s]  I'm just surprised. This is a nine-minute video
[6438.60s -> 6443.87s]  Okay, I have 65 health. I'm gonna start the next fight
[6444.27s -> 6450.87s]  With six to light I'll veto this but I want to cuz that's that's fucking bullshit. Oh god. That is absolute
[6451.55s -> 6457.59s]  Complete utter crap. Look at this guy has 260 health. This game is not possible to complete
[6457.71s -> 6462.32s]  You can't complete this that actually is bullshit though. How would you ever be able to do this?
[6462.56s -> 6467.22s]  It doesn't make any sense. It doesn't I doesn't make any sense
[6467.82s -> 6474.62s]  Why that would ever be a thing every fighting game I've ever played in my whole life. This is Street Fighter one
[6474.82s -> 6482.22s]  This is a clay fighter. That's like a staple of all fighters. What? Why would you ever remove that?
[6482.22s -> 6484.22s]  Why would you ever not do that?
[6484.26s -> 6490.74s]  Everybody starts with the same health when there's a new round. Why would you remove that from this game? That's what I don't get
[6490.74s -> 6494.80s]  I don't understand that. Okay, you got it
[6496.67s -> 6498.00s]  so
[6498.00s -> 6505.93s]  Fucking stupid. I just want a guy. I want to get past the first you're a fighting game expert
[6506.33s -> 6510.80s]  But that's true though as you yeah, you started around people who made this game
[6511.16s -> 6516.60s]  All I remember is playing off the Super Nintendo and the arcade. This was in the arcades
[6518.35s -> 6523.63s]  That's why wasted on this server. I'm more than 15 seconds
[6524.11s -> 6533.76s]  See if I can do it. Is that you you the pyro? Nope. You have to nope another rare TF2 video
[6533.76s -> 6539.28s]  Oh, you're you're pathetic little grenades. Just bounce off my manly chest
[6539.28s -> 6547.92s]  Come on shoot me again didn't work. It didn't even work. Oh, I didn't know what protects me against that
[6547.92s -> 6552.82s]  I am completely protected. Yeah, that's stir. Okay. Let's see how long you stay alive at the mid fight
[6553.10s -> 6555.92s]  Okay, why was I so jaded? If I die at this mid fight?
[6555.92s -> 6558.88s]  I have to like drink the rest of my iced coffee as fast as I can
[6558.88s -> 6562.64s]  I feel like I've been jaded since I was like fucking do you know why did you say that?
[6562.64s -> 6565.20s]  Yeah, I don't think that's ever changed. It was not a good
[6565.96s -> 6569.72s]  Ten years ago, that'll hurt your head gambling on the corner either
[6569.92s -> 6575.33s]  No, I'm going I'm going up balls to the wall. This doesn't happen. I cannot die here
[6575.33s -> 6579.37s]  Oh, here's the fine. I'm like baby smoke it ever. That was a terrible jump. I
[6580.03s -> 6584.33s]  Try I still try to see the good and things I do but I'm yeah, you know, okay
[6584.87s -> 6591.10s]  No, get this pyro out of here. Yeah, I lived I don't have to drink my ice coffee as fast as I can
[6591.10s -> 6597.43s]  I'm gonna come kill you like right disciplined emotional. That's right. Absolutely. That is absolutely correct
[6597.43s -> 6599.75s]  I thought you didn't have that much health
[6600.75s -> 6602.33s]  It's okay
[6602.33s -> 6605.41s]  It's okay. I've died from like 30 Scouts
[6605.41s -> 6610.50s]  I was sitting if my warning for I have like jello vision right now
[6610.50s -> 6615.26s]  Oh, okay that that is like kind of horrible to do something to me. No, I didn't do anything
[6616.06s -> 6618.06s]  Drugs what's going on?
[6620.42s -> 6627.49s]  This is bad, you know, this is real bad. It's serious. Um, yes. All right. Hey, oh
[6628.74s -> 6632.74s]  Tell me when you respawn. What's my name guys? Can I have a comeback Tycho RC?
[6633.42s -> 6640.48s]  Are you about to give me like a hundred percent?
[6641.64s -> 6646.72s]  You got really weak eyes. Are you respawn? I am spawned. I am spawned actually I kind of do look
[6647.12s -> 6653.61s]  What is this thing? Oh, no, do it again. I walked into like a friggin resupply what is going on?
[6654.53s -> 6658.61s]  What does this thing mean? What are we talking about? Oh, that title makes sense
[6658.61s -> 6663.41s]  Just cuz I was like what the fuck is going on. Oh dear lord. Oh boy. Oh
[6664.54s -> 6668.06s]  No
[6668.22s -> 6672.61s]  Still didn't even kill him. People are gonna think I'm a legitimate hacker
[6674.21s -> 6681.96s]  Like I killed that was unbelievably bad some pyro blew the rocket back. I
[6683.30s -> 6688.48s]  Went spy cuz I was gonna try and kill you while you were like that, but dude, I died
[6689.10s -> 6694.39s]  Time within ten seconds. I'm a having that thing. All right, let's go ten seconds
[6694.39s -> 6698.48s]  I don't know. I don't know if I can trust you. Let me have it. I know I could trust you. Hmm
[6698.48s -> 6701.90s]  All right this time I promise I'll make use of it
[6702.06s -> 6714.09s]  Oracle Mordhau I thought it ticked damage on you cuz I don't play battle royale. I played a battle royale like twice. Oh
[6715.75s -> 6719.17s]  I can't believe he's not one of these streamers. It plays battle royale every day
[6719.87s -> 6725.57s]  What I can't believe you didn't know that that was the circle
[6725.57s -> 6731.97s]  I mean this guy streams battle royales 5,000 hours. I can't believe you didn't know what I didn't know
[6731.97s -> 6744.37s]  I think it was just gray. I thought it was like gonna battlefield me and turn me around
[6745.09s -> 6747.65s]  You know what it goes like
[6747.65s -> 6756.23s]  Please get back to the playing field in five seconds. There was a battle royale. I forgot there was a bit of excuses
[6756.35s -> 6758.11s]  That's not an excuse
[6758.11s -> 6763.68s]  Hey, it's Alex. I did really well. I
[6764.28s -> 6770.38s]  Was killing people I just walked out of the circle here. I don't think he's even in the call
[6770.38s -> 6773.34s]  He needs to know how many times have I called him?
[6773.46s -> 6778.14s]  You know what? I'm getting getting realization here like I'm gonna call I'm gonna call him
[6778.18s -> 6784.16s]  How many times have I called it's Alex like I'm right now like with a complaint about something

[6800.76s -> 6803.50s]  The phones like I'm about to have the word dump soup on you
[6803.96s -> 6809.95s]  Please battle royales. Hold on. So you'd like
[6810.59s -> 6815.07s]  You strolled casually into the fog and maybe it's because I'm afraid to do that to anybody else
[6817.15s -> 6821.35s]  There are tons of people that I talked to on like a weekly basis right like a whatever do that
[6821.35s -> 6823.95s]  Can we can you cue is I don't I don't do that to other people. I
[6826.47s -> 6829.75s]  Fucking tell you something. Can you understand what's going on here? It's Alex
[6830.75s -> 6833.04s]  Party home

[6844.15s -> 6846.15s]  No, actually, I do that's like my mother to

[6865.08s -> 6872.21s]  No, no, look at me, which is weird an invite, but it's not actually like an accept invitation. No naked. Hmm
[6872.21s -> 6875.81s]  Can you join off me? He's ignoring us
[6875.81s -> 6882.22s]  Not ignoring more help what what he has no friends
[6887.28s -> 6894.40s]  By based on his true story written by to be true 2033 this is back to back. All right
[6894.40s -> 6898.44s]  Oh, do you guys remember this? Oh my god. I forgot about this stream. Oh boy
[6898.44s -> 6905.57s]  Um, I couldn't get past the tutorial in this game and I was fucking freaking out and livid. Are you okay?
[6905.57s -> 6910.18s]  No, not right now. I'm fucking angry right now. Yeah, this is bad
[6910.18s -> 6915.66s]  This actually is running against bad internet and I'm fighting against like my streaming software being a piece of shit. Ah
[6917.86s -> 6919.74s]  new game wait, no
[6919.74s -> 6921.74s]  You guys can see this right? Am I?
[6922.86s -> 6927.86s]  You guys can see this right? You're not jaded. I want to make sure that that's possible positive guy
[6928.14s -> 6937.41s]  You can see this. Okay, good. I couldn't get past the tutorial and it was pissing me off
[6937.41s -> 6942.21s]  I was playing on like the hardest difficulty because you got to play on the fucking hardest difficulty because you're on stream
[6942.21s -> 6942.73s]  You're a streamer
[6942.73s -> 6947.65s]  If you don't play on hard and everybody gonna laugh at you and like well snot rockets at you like on their screen
[6947.65s -> 6950.25s]  They're not like streaming software. I'm gonna make my own fucking internet
[6950.61s -> 6953.93s]  I'm gonna make my own streaming software my own internet in my own house
[6953.93s -> 6956.57s]  I'm gonna build my own house with my bare hands. Holy shit
[6957.17s -> 6964.02s]  Fuck this. I ain't like having somebody else have to like run my life. You know what I mean?
[6964.02s -> 6968.66s]  I'm gonna build my own house. I'm gonna put I'm gonna make my own bank. I'm gonna make my own bread
[6968.98s -> 6970.98s]  I'm gonna make my own milk
[6970.98s -> 6975.44s]  What the fuck am I talking? Can we talk about that for a second by the way?
[6976.53s -> 6978.53s]  So if you don't know I was in a snowstorm
[6978.77s -> 6981.01s]  I'm pretty bad one and
[6981.17s -> 6984.99s]  I don't know what it is with with people for some reason
[6985.49s -> 6987.86s]  What why do people buy?
[6987.90s -> 6989.50s]  bread and milk
[6989.50s -> 6994.48s]  What's the bread and milk story there? I still explain it to me you go to a grocery
[6994.48s -> 6999.56s]  Don't matter what grocery store you go to go to any grocery store before like a snowstorm or before like a hurricane or something
[7000.40s -> 7002.40s]  Especially like a snowstorm. I don't understand
[7002.56s -> 7004.80s]  You're gonna eat a bunch of bread for like a day. I
[7004.92s -> 7006.12s]  I
[7006.12s -> 7009.40s]  Wouldn't eat bread. I won't be able to eat a loaf of bread in two days
[7010.12s -> 7017.19s]  Three days four days. Why do people were you just chugging milk in your basement? Why do people buy bread and milk?
[7017.19s -> 7019.19s]  Why don't you buy like food?
[7019.31s -> 7024.44s]  What's going on there to eat where you can eat a bunch of bread? I?
[7026.19s -> 7031.80s]  Wouldn't you bet like get like a fucking a dozen chef Boyardee cans I get like a juggling bread and milk
[7031.80s -> 7042.04s]  It's nothing. It's nothing else you go to any other aisle in the grocery store, and it's full
[7042.84s -> 7050.29s]  But people are gonna just slam eat like loaves of bread and chug milk. I still didn't get it
[7050.29s -> 7053.37s]  I just don't get it like what the hell are you talking? What the hell are you doing?
[7055.24s -> 7059.91s]  Who the fuck drinks milk on like a regular basis anyways?
[7060.29s -> 7067.40s]  I'm glad we're getting away from this one my mask the thing Oh God
[7067.40s -> 7073.62s]  I could just shit my pants now. I can just buy new pants and then buy a new chair and then buy a new floor
[7074.14s -> 7079.75s]  What fuck?
[7079.79s -> 7085.71s]  That does that was next level seriously, that's just been three in a row of me just fucking furious
[7086.23s -> 7089.87s]  Phylacter is still coming in with another another ten thousand bits
[7090.43s -> 7100.62s]  The almighty dollar I gotta like it Lee. I gotta like illegal. I gotta get like I gotta move my hair. I go
[7101.10s -> 7110.76s]  He's deranged. Thank you. What am I about to do?
[7111.36s -> 7124.08s]  Holy fuck. Oh, this is nine and a half hour stream Jesus new top. Yeah, I can't even look over there. That's
[7126.16s -> 7129.51s]  This is what yeah, all right. I'm gonna be I'm vetoing this one
[7130.63s -> 7133.51s]  Free samples from Trader Joe's that's right
[7133.51s -> 7135.83s]  We're gonna go in there and go we're gonna go around the mall and
[7136.19s -> 7139.31s]  Get like the free samples from all the food court places
[7139.31s -> 7142.23s]  I want to veto this cuz I don't I'm gonna talk about like a people are subbing all again
[7142.23s -> 7147.45s]  I don't want anyone to sub. I don't sub right now. Even if it's for a job. I'm speechless
[7147.45s -> 7157.17s]  I have no idea what to say. Thanks for the fucking crazy amount of money. You guys are awesome
[7157.17s -> 7161.07s]  Yeah, this goes on for like ten minutes. I remember I'm doing it. Let's try to beat this video game
[7161.37s -> 7167.75s]  Vito, I mean, this is one of my favorite streams ever link the German mustard website. It's it's gonna be crashed
[7167.75s -> 7172.35s]  All right, where do I need to go? I gotta go plant the c4 on the hangers, which is upstairs, right?
[7172.87s -> 7180.83s]  Ban people that sub right? Which way do I go from here?
[7181.23s -> 7191.54s]  No, I think we're I think we're over it. I think it just happened like five minutes ago. And this is the post reaction, right?
[7200.39s -> 7205.35s]  I remember having one health at some point this whole game was my friend was a mess
[7205.83s -> 7213.74s]  Is he dead? I think I need him. Don't I my I had like a clenched in the door teeth
[7214.18s -> 7221.39s]  Clenched ass this entire time. I played this game this gap
[7224.32s -> 7228.36s]  Guys like dead you actually just did that. I need this guy so I'm gonna heal him
[7228.36s -> 7236.67s]  But what you hiding behind the door? All right, ten seconds. Let's go. Okay, let's keep going
[7237.19s -> 7248.23s]  Anything else in here that I can grab? I got a shave man. Look young little rift area thing
[7248.75s -> 7254.15s]  My impressions but this thing right here has to be protected and these doors over here
[7254.15s -> 7255.67s]  If you look in the top right of the screen
[7255.67s -> 7261.19s]  This door is gonna open and this door down here is gonna open as well. What's gonna happen is orcs
[7261.75s -> 7267.35s]  Hundreds and hundreds of orcs are going to pour out of those places and you have to defend them
[7267.35s -> 7272.83s]  You have to kill them all or else they're going to take that over back when so how do you do this?
[7272.95s -> 7273.95s]  Also
[7273.95s -> 7278.91s]  With your crossjournal, you can shoot it like this. It has a couple of little features, too
[7278.91s -> 7281.09s]  You can do like I don't know why we all thought that place
[7281.31s -> 7286.95s]  But the cool part about this game and why it's sort of like tower defense is because you have all these things you can put
[7286.95s -> 7293.36s]  Down so I have started to upgrade or I've already upgraded this poison spike trap and I use the
[7294.00s -> 7297.20s]  Super boom barrel, but I'm not gonna use that right now because I don't you don't
[7298.20s -> 7300.20s]  I don't
[7300.20s -> 7304.48s]  Really really interesting in this game and look at how many spells you're gonna actually end up getting two more
[7304.48s -> 7317.32s]  It's a whole lot of fun. And yes, you'll see what I'm gonna do here is beat up. I remember this game
[7326.39s -> 7339.69s]  America's funny some videos. Oh, yeah, I played this for three hours. Can you hear the fucking jewelry is tapping?
[7340.37s -> 7342.21s]  God's right. How do I dodge?
[7342.21s -> 7349.87s]  You just saw this one, right? This game is really fun. I
[7350.43s -> 7354.59s]  I want more games like this that are just fun. Don't funny. I don't care if they're like
[7355.51s -> 7358.37s]  60 plus hour experiences hundred-hour experiences
[7358.37s -> 7365.27s]  I would gladly pay 40 to 60 dollars for a game that even if I get three to six whatever four to six hours of
[7366.91s -> 7370.12s]  Enjoyment from it. I just want a game. That's fun
[7371.00s -> 7373.49s]  and then I don't have to have like a
[7374.21s -> 7379.17s]  Legend on a mini-map fuck with like 15 different keys on the legend
[7379.17s -> 7383.21s]  You know what I mean? Like oh, there's like that turn in there's like the side quest. There's the collection
[7383.25s -> 7386.17s]  There's the other collection. There is the side mission for the collection
[7387.89s -> 7397.21s]  Care I just give me a nice it's gonna be a fun game. I'll pay the money. That's a number 98 opinion
[7397.21s -> 7400.29s]  No, I can't go forward. I can't go left or right
[7402.77s -> 7411.28s]  Talk shit talk shit talk shit talk. Why are you chanting that?
[7416.77s -> 7423.13s]  Chanting in the back just like come on talk. What shit talk shit talk. All right
[7425.29s -> 7427.85s]  All right, okay. Yeah, I hear you. Okay
[7428.37s -> 7430.08s]  I think
[7430.08s -> 7434.77s]  That I think that if you throw it make a game. That's even
[7435.21s -> 7439.27s]  Two to three hours long but has some replayability and some and share ability
[7439.73s -> 7442.09s]  Think about that. You want to share this kind of shit?
[7442.09s -> 7444.97s]  Like let's say it's only like a four or five hour game
[7445.53s -> 7450.33s]  Your ability to want other people to enjoy it is another reason to why to pay the money. I
[7453.70s -> 7458.54s]  Cannot tell you the last time and I fucking mean this the last time
[7459.02s -> 7461.02s]  I paid for a triple-a game
[7461.94s -> 7462.94s]  I
[7462.94s -> 7466.82s]  Wanted somebody else to play it too. I like wanted to share it with somebody. Nope
[7466.82s -> 7469.42s]  Give me a deal has not happened in a very very long time
[7470.58s -> 7475.66s]  You play some of these triple-a games that are like 60 bucks and you just want to forget they existed
[7475.66s -> 7478.10s]  You mean you enjoy them for like a couple hours and you forget they exist
[7478.10s -> 7481.58s]  I want to be able to tell everybody about this shit
[7481.58s -> 7486.50s]  Like remember Stardew Valley you remember like telling everybody how fun Stardew Valley was and you've got a fucking play
[7486.54s -> 7489.26s]  You've got to play it that doesn't happen
[7493.62s -> 7499.06s]  $60 is worth it to me if I can share it with people. We actually class shorts there. That's a reddit take
[7499.96s -> 7506.25s]  Just maybe stub my toe. I just stub my toe right here and that's your fault
[7506.25s -> 7513.95s]  And I want you banned for at least 10 seconds. I can probably try to what is this game?
[7514.43s -> 7523.75s]  Clone drone in the dangers. Oh, I'm over this. This is actually kind of fun. I think I was playing with people in the chat
[7523.75s -> 7524.83s]  Wasn't I?
[7524.83s -> 7533.66s]  It's like a lightsaber robot game watch out for the train
[7543.27s -> 7546.31s]  Wanting to connect with other people is the least reddit take Oh
[7549.38s -> 7552.70s]  Spikes. Oh, he died. I just got dunked on. Holy shit. That was bad
[7553.90s -> 7558.65s]  All right. Now, I know what I'm doing. I get that was I got slammed dunked on I'm going with a hammer here
[7561.12s -> 7567.08s]  Probably should have an armor, but I got I got another chance here. Where is he up there games for me?
[7567.08s -> 7572.16s]  Are all about being able to like wanted a chase game to play them to show them to people
[7572.48s -> 7575.50s]  That was one of the reasons for like the original YouTube channel
[7575.98s -> 7580.50s]  We actually are doing the chase game. I wanted to show people something because I thought it was really cool fun
[7580.50s -> 7582.50s]  Like I really liked it
[7585.54s -> 7591.88s]  If I can't be confident to tell you how much I want to like share an experience with you or like tell you that
[7591.88s -> 7593.48s]  You should try something
[7593.48s -> 7595.89s]  All right. Here we go
[7595.89s -> 7601.49s]  No jammer and armor see if we can't seal the deal here
[7601.49s -> 7604.21s]  Oh, he might see what you want to show people how to backstab as a spy
[7604.21s -> 7607.21s]  Well, cuz spy was the little my favorite thing in the world. That was like my favorite thing ever
[7607.69s -> 7611.26s]  You're on his reddit take. Holy shit. That was sick
[7614.10s -> 7616.10s]  This game looks good
[7617.66s -> 7619.66s]  This game actually looks pretty fun
[7619.74s -> 7626.10s]  Smog yeah gets smogged. Good game, dude. Seriously. That was a ton of fun
[7626.50s -> 7630.54s]  Let's be the last one that we're gonna take a piss break and come back and we'll do challenge mode
[7630.94s -> 7639.59s]  Spinning wheel of death say it like you haven't played it before you're forced to fight on the one level
[7640.79s -> 7646.59s]  I don't know. I forget everything. Yes. I don't remember anything that I ever do ever
[7647.05s -> 7652.61s]  That's why these streams are so weird to me. We just did it for like 45 minutes and it was it was just fucking mess
[7652.61s -> 7654.61s]  I don't remember saying any of these words
[7654.61s -> 7659.98s]  What's this game called? This game is?
[7660.26s -> 7663.54s]  Clone drone in the danger zone. I gotta go in aggressive
[7663.54s -> 7669.02s]  I think we're gonna get into the BRB though after this next one unless I beat away with the game here
[7669.30s -> 7677.17s]  For this experiment to work. We've got to win three times did once not more a lot of TF2 and do it again. Oh
[7678.98s -> 7680.98s]  Wow, I can't do that shit anymore
[7681.66s -> 7685.50s]  Got ya, is it gonna be a second win? It's gonna be a second win. I
[7686.50s -> 7690.10s]  This is win number two and I don't even need to make an edit. I don't think
[7690.74s -> 7691.78s]  because
[7691.78s -> 7696.80s]  That was like two seconds. So we can just keep talking about like I don't know the weather
[7697.22s -> 7703.99s]  Jack's now it's got a dead sunny outright overcast right now. It ain't bad edit Andy. It ain't very good last from the past
[7703.99s -> 7709.35s]  What is this about? Well, I know how to I know how to play territory control. Don't worry. I've played it before about hydro
[7709.99s -> 7712.99s]  Let's do it again. Oh, it is hydro like two minutes
[7712.99s -> 7719.35s]  Let's get at the third victory on hydro and then I can go eat like a banana, right?
[7719.35s -> 7723.75s]  I think I had to do this on my server because nobody played this so like why not right?
[7723.75s -> 7728.67s]  Why wouldn't you eat a bunch of bananas if you bought why there's this many people in this one tunnel? That's right
[7729.23s -> 7733.23s]  This is like we're gonna win. Did we get a bingo? You got one
[7733.67s -> 7739.83s]  I'll show you the updated card. I didn't do it. I didn't do anything. I didn't do it looking for a rumor still looking for
[7741.11s -> 7742.59s]  ejects moment
[7742.59s -> 7744.59s]  naked
[7747.65s -> 7751.49s]  Played hydro. I mean some people do it again
[7752.85s -> 7757.45s]  Third time's a charm. Let's go. You've only been naked three times. I've been no no edits
[7757.45s -> 7761.13s]  We're not doing any editing right now. I want to I want to see for myself. I've been naked
[7761.89s -> 7763.89s]  four or five hundred times on screen
[7766.04s -> 7770.70s]  I've been naked probably okay, how many how many streams have I ever done a thousand
[7772.64s -> 7774.64s]  I've streamed about a thousand times
[7775.00s -> 7778.40s]  I've been naked seven or eight hundred of those times
[7780.02s -> 7782.02s]  I'm just not on camera
[7788.70s -> 7796.34s]  Well, not naked like with no clothes on but like no shirt or like shirt and you know, I'm not
[7798.30s -> 7804.54s]  Right now things are just happening. I'm gonna get myself in trouble. I need to shut up and we're gonna win quiet. Yeah
[7805.94s -> 7807.94s]  Stand up right now. You did it. No
[7810.34s -> 7813.91s]  All right, we got to the end of this video. I'm gonna pause it
[7813.91s -> 7815.11s]  I'm gonna take a VRB. I'm gonna go pee
[7815.11s -> 7819.07s]  Why you do it?
[7819.07s -> 7825.55s]  Why would I ever turn a webcam on if I didn't have pants or underwear on are you guys out of your mind?
[7825.91s -> 7831.47s]  The risk I told you about the dream that I had that time. That's a reality for me
[7831.47s -> 7834.33s]  I had a dream one time for those of you that are new
[7834.81s -> 7843.08s]  Where I was sitting here talking and I stood up for a second and I was naked and for a tiny little frame
[7843.28s -> 7847.37s]  Like okay, this is weird. This is maybe you click the mature body and sporting
[7847.37s -> 7852.82s]  I don't give a shit but like one little frame my like my dick was on camera and
[7853.30s -> 7856.10s]  Like a 20-30 minute stop knows I'm talking
[7856.10s -> 7860.86s]  but like a tab for like not it was like a little like a tenth of a second frame and
[7863.18s -> 7868.58s]  Like I nobody said anything I looked over at the chat and it was like I've realized what had happened
[7868.58s -> 7871.06s]  I was like, holy shit. I think like I just my dick was just on camera
[7871.06s -> 7872.14s]  I like balls were on camera
[7872.14s -> 7876.26s]  But nobody was saying anything and you know for a fact that if that happened in real life
[7876.38s -> 7881.46s]  It would be dick dick dick. I could see his dick dick dick, you know, maybe that's what all it would be
[7881.50s -> 7886.26s]  So I didn't see that so sitting there going. Holy shit. Did nobody see that?
[7886.26s -> 7887.92s]  I like but I have to can't even address it
[7887.92s -> 7889.60s]  I have to like delete the vaude
[7889.60s -> 7893.34s]  But if I delete the vaude wouldn't that be like kind of suspicious I was like, how did nobody see that?
[7893.38s -> 7896.43s]  I was like freaking out about it. I was like fuck man
[7896.43s -> 7902.38s]  I think people saw that and then I woke up so I've had that dream before was like, okay ready like I
[7902.58s -> 7906.50s]  Stood up first thing. I like stretched my back and we're talking like right
[7907.30s -> 7913.78s]  It's like dick right here. I just just right and I was like, holy fuck
[7913.78s -> 7919.66s]  I think my camera was small enough where I don't think anybody caught it, right? All right, I'll be right back
[7919.66s -> 8126.70s]  I'm gonna pee. I'll see you in a minute. Okay, what's happening? Also, by the way, just to make sure everybody's aware
[8128.52s -> 8135.00s]  As of probably next weekend nominations are gonna open up for
[8135.44s -> 8145.49s]  The best and worst award show start to get the categories ready. It'll be in the discord
[8145.69s -> 8153.12s]  The dollhouse is gonna auto win every category
[8153.28s -> 8154.68s]  well
[8154.68s -> 8160.54s]  I'm thinking of potentially just graying out the dollhouse
[8160.62s -> 8169.30s]  Because we'll end up with the Lord of the Rings the return of the king where it wins every category at the Oscars
[8169.52s -> 8181.04s]  That's it. Have it be its own category. Yeah, that makes sense
[8181.04s -> 8184.46s]  Ah
[8184.46s -> 8195.70s]  So instead we'll only have four streams to choose from what what do you mean four streams?
[8195.96s -> 8203.12s]  It should be a moment from that stream. Yeah that I'll get some good categories. They're only four
[8209.61s -> 8217.76s]  And
[8217.76s -> 8222.96s]  Stop the music. All right, that's very jarring for a lot of you. I apologize. We're coming back
[8222.96s -> 8227.76s]  We're going to do how long they're gonna we're gonna click it again because we need to kind of recalibrate here
[8227.76s -> 8233.04s]  It is currently there are 40 more minutes remaining
[8233.88s -> 8237.32s]  I'll add another I'll add 10 more minutes. So there's 50 is an hour
[8237.32s -> 8241.24s]  Let's call it an hour because the BRBs for you to get any more bingos
[8241.40s -> 8248.84s]  What's the BRB music from that is from Bloor Dow an incredibly talented individual
[8248.84s -> 8253.62s]  He's made all the music pretty much for this channel all the art. Literally the BRB screen
[8253.62s -> 8256.35s]  You're looking at right now was made by Bloor Dow. Oh
[8257.27s -> 8262.81s]  By the way, let's talk about this for a second. Lord out is currently we talked
[8263.69s -> 8270.82s]  Day or so ago Lord. I was making four new BRB screens and they're gonna be seasonal which holy
[8271.62s -> 8281.24s]  Champ, right four new BRB screens and I just kind of told him more music. He's gonna make a bunch more tracks
[8281.42s -> 8284.84s]  We're gonna get more blood out of music at least probably four or five more
[8284.84s -> 8295.27s]  I'm telling you let me be the first to tell you what when when Lord Oh eventually gets hired
[8295.43s -> 8299.14s]  We're doing like a fucking it's like a game soundtrack of the year
[8299.14s -> 8309.14s]  Like whatever whenever it is because it's gonna happen. Yeah, I just we knew first we knew here first, right?
[8309.22s -> 8317.30s]  We knew first it's gonna be so awesome to be like a Bloor Dow hipster when he wins fucking game
[8317.46s -> 8328.13s]  Soundtrack of the year in like five years. I liked him. I knew it and I liked his music before you did
[8334.09s -> 8343.60s]  I'm excited to see what um, what he makes you're gonna be a gatekeeping. I'm just kidding. I'm not gonna do that
[8343.60s -> 8377.11s]  You can't the world is ending in 2022. That's I did why are you saying that? Why you say that?
[8377.15s -> 8387.07s]  I mean, he doesn't know you have a setting selected that makes YouTube videos come up much more often
[8387.37s -> 8393.28s]  It's part it's part of the site
[8393.28s -> 8396.78s]  I wanted to make sure that YouTube videos had an equal chance to show up
[8396.78s -> 8403.30s]  It still is like I think like 25% chance though because last time last time we did this
[8403.30s -> 8407.54s]  I just was doing the random and it was like 2% chance to get a video
[8407.54s -> 8414.37s]  so now what it does is I believe is it picks the video file first and
[8415.14s -> 8418.32s]  Then picks a timestamp. That's kind of how I imagined it
[8418.40s -> 8427.26s]  So I think it what I think before just picked like a timestamp now it picks a video file then the timestamp
[8427.26s -> 8438.51s]  So that that's not rigged. That's exactly how it probably should be. You're gonna stream Elden Ring now fuck that game
[8438.51s -> 8454.27s]  All right. Um, let's go. Of course I am I think I can't fucking contain my excitement for that game
[8454.27s -> 8463.93s]  All right, let's put the timer back on. Here we go. Let's just remind everybody about the bingo card that currently stands
[8463.93s -> 8475.68s]  I don't think it's gonna happen again going over these
[8475.68s -> 8490.36s]  No, you need a significant moment for some of these to happen. Who's your favorite Game of Thrones character Varys?
[8490.36s -> 8494.39s]  I don't know why I answered that that show is fucking completely who cares about that anymore
[8494.61s -> 8501.58s]  Intended like didn't like HBO come out with like the trailer for like new series
[8501.58s -> 8506.40s]  They were gonna do and it had like fucking four likes on Twitter. We got like retweeted like eight times
[8506.40s -> 8521.65s]  I didn't have something like that. I don't remember stop pretending pretending about my favorite character is do you only know something funny?
[8521.77s -> 8524.71s]  Okay, this is a confession
[8524.71s -> 8531.84s]  We're gonna do confessional right now the amount of okay the amount of times that I've watched and I don't even know why I still
[8531.84s -> 8537.00s]  Do this, but I just do the amount of times that I've watched the Varys. Okay. Hold on
[8537.00s -> 8539.17s]  This is spoilers for Game of Thrones
[8539.55s -> 8543.79s]  Spoilers for Game of Thrones the the series I'm just gonna tell you. Okay, here we go. Here it comes
[8543.79s -> 8546.67s]  You know, if you don't want to hear a spoiler why who cares the show is over
[8548.37s -> 8551.85s]  Varys visiting Ned in the dungeon both times
[8553.08s -> 8559.04s]  I've probably watched collectively and I'm not kidding. I'm not I'm trying being desperately completely truthful with you
[8559.04s -> 8570.58s]  I've watched that scene on YouTube. I'll be four or five hundred times total over the last five plus years
[8570.58s -> 8575.66s]  I don't even know why I just get I know every single line by heart. I know the whole thing
[8575.66s -> 8578.30s]  I don't even know why I just I like it. I like that scene
[8578.30s -> 8587.66s]  I don't know why I swear to God, it's been four or five hundred times. You quoted all the time
[8587.66s -> 8604.70s]  I believe I I'm telling you recite it Lord Stark. You must be thirsty
[8606.64s -> 8609.01s]  No, I'm not doing this
[8617.60s -> 8624.74s]  No, not so much my lord men have been known to die of thirst in these holes hide it push it away
[8625.74s -> 8648.52s]  Keep going. I don't think I can well, let me see if I can actually do this. I've seen five hundred
[8648.52s -> 8651.40s]  But I'm like on the spot. I'm kind of nervous. I like don't want to do this
[8654.95s -> 8657.79s]  And then it goes. Okay men have been noted I thirst in these holes
[8657.91s -> 8660.74s]  I'm gonna I'm gonna mix them together
[8660.74s -> 8667.21s]  But who cares what madness has led you to tell the Queen the you know, the truth of Joffrey's birth
[8669.12s -> 8673.06s]  Madness of mercy. She might cheat save her children
[8675.30s -> 8681.90s]  Mercy, I'm done. I'm actually done. I'm not doing this veto veto veto veto veto veto veto veto. I'm vetoing
[8681.90s -> 8686.18s]  I'm fucking done. I'm like embarrassed. I'm at this first time
[8686.18s -> 8700.83s]  I've ever been embarrassed on stream is that I can't get am I gonna get sued if I dub this if I can see it
[8700.83s -> 8709.53s]  I can do it and I'm not kidding. No, no, no, no, I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I don't want to do that
[8715.12s -> 8718.88s]  Clear the debt
[8719.00s -> 8727.13s]  No, it's not happening. Let's go
[8740.10s -> 8741.44s]  Spawn camp
[8741.44s -> 8746.39s]  What are you gonna do? You can open up that fucking spawn door, right? That's ours. I'm vetoing another tf2 video
[8746.93s -> 8757.80s]  Veto we've seen I'm vetoing tf2. We've seen a lot of it. I'm vetoing veto incoming
[8757.80s -> 8765.72s]  I have to I have one more veto after this time has never been the same ever since I got a robo hand built by
[8765.72s -> 8771.22s]  Robo and incorporated the grip is just too tight. I keep telling them to loosen it, but they refuse to help me out
[8771.22s -> 8777.77s]  I think it's a conspiracy. Do you know robo hand industries are owned by the same company who specialize in PP reconstruction?
[8779.11s -> 8781.11s]  Fuck is happening
[8783.03s -> 8786.93s]  NKVC thanks for the $1. Here is some free money cuz why not? Thanks man

[8803.93s -> 8808.22s]  Yeah, I'll add it. Okay fine. That was fucking ridiculous
[8810.16s -> 8812.72s]  PP reconstruction
[8815.32s -> 8818.28s]  Oh, man, there's an opportunity for another 200 community subs. I
[8820.96s -> 8822.80s]  Think I think I know what happened tonight
[8822.80s -> 8828.76s]  So like the TV bit brought us up to an 11 and then I played this fucking boring game
[8828.76s -> 8833.32s]  And it brought us down to like a 4 so I think I think I understand what happened here
[8833.62s -> 8839.95s]  We started off at an 11 and we came down to like a three and a half. What like energy wise?
[8840.39s -> 8844.94s]  I'm a vamp here the title
[8846.05s -> 8851.25s]  Vampire I remember that was that was like a really hyped up game. Wasn't it from what I remember admits it was poor
[8851.29s -> 8856.93s]  I'm not I don't I don't think that forget what the story with that was at the opening credits
[8857.29s -> 8859.57s]  the huge fight scene happens and
[8860.01s -> 8866.29s]  You know Jackie Chan has taken on like 30 people. It's the new Jackie Chan movie credits open bang bang bang bang
[8867.33s -> 8869.37s]  Through the guy brings a ladder up
[8869.37s -> 8875.41s]  He dies through the ladder hits the guy in the face swings ladder around bang bang bang bang bang four guys around go flying through windows
[8876.05s -> 8880.83s]  Explosions everywhere and then the rest of the movie is Jackie Chan at a desk
[8881.81s -> 8889.06s]  Writing letters for an hour. That's the rest of the movie. That's what happened today. That's that's what this movie was
[8889.74s -> 8896.88s]  That's what happened. Nice elevator pitch for your show or movie
[8896.88s -> 8910.30s]  He was writing his Christmas cards for the rest of the movie for three hours. All right, we're looking for well
[8910.30s -> 8912.46s]  I'm not looking for this cuz okay naked
[8913.14s -> 8915.88s]  Jax it has to be a real Jax moment under these bullshit
[8916.26s -> 8924.06s]  The movie was too interesting in the first like 12 minutes and then I was writing Christmas cards for four hours
[8924.06s -> 8929.02s]  All right, 20 seconds. Let's go. What the fuck is he saying? Okay, let me translate
[8929.66s -> 8934.96s]  Thank you. Mars gaming. The game was exciting for the first 10 minutes and then it was terrible and boring for the next two hours
[8935.98s -> 8942.66s]  Lenny face what the fuck that's old. That's very old Lenny face
[8943.71s -> 8948.38s]  My god, I'm an idiot. Oh an exit an egg that

[9022.86s -> 9024.86s]  I can't even swing my sword
[9027.28s -> 9029.86s]  Back in like 2012 2013
[9031.68s -> 9037.60s]  This was not as popular as everybody it is now back in like 2010 2011
[9038.64s -> 9042.12s]  No, don't kill me. This was just like why the fuck do people like this?

[9049.86s -> 9052.98s]  What's the guy I have to start over again like this?
[9054.98s -> 9056.94s]  Stupid when I first played it fuck is going on
[9056.94s -> 9059.18s]  I had to pull the cord out of the back of my head and go wait a minute
[9059.18s -> 9063.90s]  This is incredible if we're like I gotta I have to play this it took like a year after this video
[9064.46s -> 9073.72s]  Not gonna be an idiot. Oh, that's so much more damage. I had the exact same experience. Yeah, I want to know the actual statistic
[9074.56s -> 9077.92s]  Of people that played dark souls when it first came out or demon souls
[9078.32s -> 9083.66s]  Said I don't I don't get it and then came back two years later and played it again and was like holy shit

[9084.98s -> 9088.86s]  It's probably a shitload of you
[9089.02s -> 9098.74s]  What does that even do? I can't even do it. Look at okay. You can't get me while I'm jumping
[9098.74s -> 9101.82s]  I know I want my this is an edited video of dark souls

[9206.42s -> 9218.30s]  Thanks for the fucking curse. Take it off. Take it off. I know there's a fucking goddamn goblin or like
[9218.82s -> 9222.66s]  Genie or something watching this right now, then put that curse on and you're sitting there going like
[9223.46s -> 9224.74s]  Yes
[9224.74s -> 9236.14s]  Take it off now. Take it off. We're so good. Goblins aren't real
[9236.26s -> 9251.06s]  Yes, they are. You best start believing in ghost stories because I'm a guy. I'm a goblin. That's whatever
[9252.26s -> 9262.42s]  That's so rude
[9263.49s -> 9265.01s]  So rude
[9265.01s -> 9272.16s]  I'm just it was a just a joke everybody relax. I'm kidding. Oh my god. I'm kidding
[9272.76s -> 9280.43s]  Is Santa real yes, who else puts the presents under my tree? What was you gonna say? It's like my mom and dad
[9281.73s -> 9299.22s]  Let's go. I got a ninth. You know, let's just leave it on whatever. What's next overuse Santa joke
[9299.34s -> 9308.57s]  It's like getting to be holiday season. They're in style right now. Please don't tell me this is the corridor mission
[9308.57s -> 9314.24s]  No, not that one the one after that one because the corridor missions to Earth Defense Force five equipment
[9314.24s -> 9318.76s]  Do we eventually get I wonder if I call italics in this room and he's in it
[9319.04s -> 9324.46s]  Um, I don't for fence Spencer, I don't know. Yeah, I don't remember them having support
[9329.10s -> 9331.69s]  Let's try the bolt gun
[9331.69s -> 9334.37s]  Okay, are you hurting me? I am
[9335.37s -> 9340.45s]  Edf teaches you pretty early on to go back and farm now that repeated weapons get upgraded
[9340.45s -> 9344.69s]  So I guess if you find the same weapon again game was so much fun. That's cool. I
[9346.10s -> 9350.46s]  Remember we were gonna play this a shitload better than one and we just never did ever again
[9350.94s -> 9353.38s]  Who this this thing is actually really great
[9354.10s -> 9359.20s]  It's a great single target. They come up with another one, but it wasn't Edf
[9359.20s -> 9364.68s]  It was like Edf Dragon Lance was a good choice. Whoever suggested it. Thanks. I don't know what it wasn't a numbered one
[9364.68s -> 9366.16s]  I'm gonna go that far though
[9366.16s -> 9369.85s]  What's the new one? It's so easy. If six is coming out
[9370.53s -> 9372.53s]  Well, I don't play it
[9374.01s -> 9380.06s]  Three new ones. Holy shit. I love these games. It's just shoot shit
[9381.06s -> 9386.30s]  Iron rain sucked that that's what I'm thinking of. I'm not seeing very many crates. It was maybe a different studio, right?
[9386.30s -> 9388.30s]  It's so slow. These are so heavy
[9392.23s -> 9394.23s]  Doing this because if I look tiny
[9394.51s -> 9398.43s]  I'm just look if I don't frame myself correctly. I look really small
[9399.03s -> 9403.51s]  If I frame myself like this, I'm fucking huge jacked like handsome and shit. You know, I mean
[9405.28s -> 9407.28s]  Six would be good. All right
[9408.33s -> 9410.33s]  This definitely doesn't feel harder
[9416.15s -> 9417.79s]  Crap
[9417.79s -> 9423.96s]  This is just playing the game. What happened to you being jacked?
[9425.80s -> 9428.72s]  I mean I was in the gym. It only goes into four or five days a week
[9429.40s -> 9437.53s]  That's what happened. I stopped doing that. I got it does but I missed realness made it hard to really do stuff like that anymore
[9439.94s -> 9443.82s]  Now I just like eat food this thing I'd rather just use the other lighting gun
[9446.79s -> 9450.95s]  Wait, why are combat? I missed the 500 sub celebration video
[9454.91s -> 9456.91s]  30 more seconds
[9465.20s -> 9470.92s]  Alright we go you've got about 30 minutes to fill the rest of those slots. It's so hard to aim
[9471.84s -> 9475.96s]  Yeah, you don't see it anywhere to buy. Yeah for some reason thousand people here
[9476.32s -> 9481.90s]  We're on the PlayStation store, you have to go look no you have to like look for it was up like purposefully search it. Oh
[9483.15s -> 9487.27s]  God in 2018. Yeah, I explained what we're doing again. I think I've done it a few times
[9496.20s -> 9501.82s]  Man that was crazy. I can't believe that just happened. I hope it doesn't happen again
[9506.90s -> 9511.34s]  Protect me my BS protect me
[9514.50s -> 9518.14s]  Weapons they don't even know where they're going
[9520.72s -> 9527.18s]  My god, they're awful. They're not even attacking anything just running
[9528.08s -> 9530.51s]  You guys suck
[9536.80s -> 9539.02s]  This is a classic a classic comedy
[9548.12s -> 9552.07s]  This goes out to the broken hearted
[9552.87s -> 9555.07s]  We already have singing on there. Don't worry
[9555.67s -> 9560.28s]  It's my life and it's now or never
[9561.80s -> 9564.32s]  I don't want to live forever
[9565.40s -> 9567.40s]  Not bad. I just
[9567.80s -> 9572.08s]  He hasn't talked this whole time
[9572.84s -> 9578.85s]  I died with god Modan. I have no control over my character
[9580.28s -> 9586.04s]  I'm just on fire. How are you on?
[9589.46s -> 9592.14s]  What wait, there's a dinosaur
[9600.82s -> 9604.58s]  Oh, yes, I got up there I forgot about this. Oh
[9610.57s -> 9619.53s]  Man back in the back of the day when I remember stir used to hit me up and say hey
[9619.93s -> 9625.75s]  I downloaded too many mods and my computer crashed. Would you like to play GTA? He's like, yeah, sure, of course
[9626.83s -> 9635.64s]  All these videos of all the weird mods and all like just the the asset replacements the character replacements
[9636.63s -> 9641.19s]  GTA 4 I think is my favorite GTA probably out of all of them
[9641.19s -> 9648.20s]  But I can't ever go back and play it ever again. It's it's I can't
[9648.32s -> 9654.93s]  I'm just imagining a car flying by and like an elephant in a giraffe falling out with parachutes on and like
[9655.09s -> 9659.69s]  500 explosions going on behind me and like I can't die and shit. Like I can't play it anymore
[9659.69s -> 9664.41s]  I have over modded to the point where I can't even enjoy it. Same thing with Skyrim
[9664.41s -> 9672.49s]  I play a character. I've never played before and like know how to play this fucking game like this character
[9672.49s -> 9683.41s]  You got another complaint stream. That's too much pressure. I hated this game, too
[9683.41s -> 9688.35s]  I've really hated this and I didn't want to say I hated it because I knew a lot of people liked it and I didn't
[9688.35s -> 9690.01s]  want to be like the
[9690.01s -> 9691.33s]  contradicting Andy
[9691.33s -> 9697.04s]  What and everybody would be like, oh you fucking just suck at it. Like I hated this
[9697.68s -> 9702.04s]  Actually, this is great. Can I go back like years later so I can tell you what I was really thinking
[9702.04s -> 9704.98s]  I hated this game. Yes, you casual
[9705.84s -> 9709.34s]  Bend that guy for life for real like give the gift that guy the first
[9709.86s -> 9717.66s]  Real full full band for that I've ever given man that guy fucking fine. I don't ever see that guy again. Damn. I
[9721.98s -> 9727.48s]  Hate this game. I really don't just turn the chat off. I don't want to know turn off the chat
[9727.88s -> 9734.48s]  Keep it on we were doing 2v2s. We were getting destroyed. No stir was like carrying hard and I was dying and getting mad
[9734.48s -> 9737.68s]  I don't do that. I'm kidding. I'm curious. How does it play out?
[9748.56s -> 9750.12s]  shield bad
[9750.12s -> 9763.45s]  Shield is broken shield guys broken
[9764.57s -> 9766.35s]  still

[9780.15s -> 9787.48s]  You know what is this thing still live? I'm gonna beat this guy
[9800.36s -> 9806.76s]  Fucking brought that guy's health to zero you can cancel out of literally anything with revenge mode
[9806.76s -> 9809.44s]  So mid-grab you probably had one hell that that dude
[9809.44s -> 9815.16s]  I stabbed him three times with zero health and then he pressed triangle and got all his health back and can kill me round two
[9815.68s -> 9817.68s]  What? Yeah, why is that?
[9818.32s -> 9822.76s]  Wow, what the fuck is the point of that no explain that to me playing obi soft I want an employee
[9822.76s -> 9827.60s]  Hey, would you like an explanation? They added that mechanic into the game to help you win?
[9828.44s -> 9830.44s]  against multiple enemies
[9832.72s -> 9834.92s]  Karen and yet he was able to build revenge
[9835.76s -> 9837.00s]  I
[9837.00s -> 9839.24s]  Am kind of a gamer Karen aren't I?
[9841.64s -> 9852.35s]  Seriously, I was I was somebody from management to tell me I want a written letter about it. Oh, we just did this
[9854.24s -> 9860.44s]  The next room contained an oh, yes under the dear hatchet family crest on the desk were many
[9861.00s -> 9867.87s]  Recent veto. No, I'm not wasting my last veto on this. This is I loved this. This was a ton of fun old coins wine
[9868.59s -> 9870.96s]  cryptic runes
[9871.16s -> 9877.28s]  Decide for the runes, but it's our veto. Are you guys gonna use one here? Just as I picked up that'll leave you with two
[9878.16s -> 9883.50s]  The candle lit itself and a funky phantom friar floated into the room
[9886.04s -> 9888.04s]  No veto
[9889.68s -> 9897.73s]  This guy looks friendly, okay burn his papers enjoy wine and candle light. Are you naked here?
[9897.73s -> 9902.05s]  I don't he's snapping fingers the candle in a glass of the house
[9903.09s -> 9906.41s]  Extend why this dream was a week ago the ghost what?
[9907.21s -> 9910.15s]  Why would I extend this frame? You can just go well, I didn't want to kill him
[9910.15s -> 9913.17s]  He just wanted to hang out six days ago. Oops. Well, uh
[9914.85s -> 9916.85s]  Sorry, I'm one I couldn't mute
[9916.89s -> 9920.53s]  What's the deal? No that you thought half of these monsters
[9920.53s -> 9924.79s]  I want a very non hostile walk of the Golden's place
[9924.79s -> 9935.92s]  We're staying to watch the stream that just happened you can do a Thanksgiving stream. No music room. I want to go to the music room
[9936.34s -> 9940.93s]  You do but your voice sounds different. What happened dude?
[9940.93s -> 9948.68s]  We sound completely different you like leave the cellar search the cell. Where's the music room sounds like older from now
[9949.04s -> 9955.87s]  Hmm
[9958.19s -> 9968.12s]  Dude you sound wicked jaded music room sound jaded whistle sound hummer first floor say second floor second floor
[9969.43s -> 9971.51s]  I'm gonna use my last veto you guys won't
[9972.15s -> 9975.70s]  The second floor looked dark and uninviting
[9976.62s -> 9986.27s]  It's only another 50 seconds. It could room at random find the kitchen waste your veto. No
[9986.97s -> 9995.85s]  Good eats the room. I next entered was obviously a library of some running out of time
[9995.99s -> 9998.31s]  Well, yeah, you got a great job. We had about 20 minutes. Oh
[9998.95s -> 10001.07s]  There is there was a door to my left
[10001.07s -> 10006.39s]  See the reason why you should be using your vetoes as a collective chat room if you have you'll have three you still have my right
[10006.83s -> 10009.55s]  Looking for bingo here and I'm telling you right now
[10009.55s -> 10014.69s]  you're not gonna get it here and you have about 25 minutes, so you need to really kind of get your act together and
[10015.57s -> 10022.29s]  Skip some of these streams that are three minutes of just waste time. Let's go right. Let's see. I'm just telling you
[10022.29s -> 10027.31s]  I couldn't put my finger on it, but there was something odd about the woman in the kitchen. Here we go
[10027.73s -> 10029.65s]  You're hungry
[10029.65s -> 10032.53s]  That's why you haven't seen me lately
[10032.61s -> 10039.31s]  but I'm coming right back at you with this daisy game play and I've been playing this game for the last three weeks or so and
[10039.79s -> 10045.39s]  Something to remember something of note. I've died every single fucking time. I've ever played this game
[10045.39s -> 10049.43s]  I don't have any really suits or any sniper rifles or anything like that
[10049.79s -> 10054.23s]  But I live on the edge. I live dangerously as you see right here walking on the main road
[10054.43s -> 10056.43s]  This is new to me, I don't remember this
[10075.95s -> 10076.45s]  Vito
[10083.71s -> 10085.71s]  You have to vote for this
[10085.95s -> 10089.99s]  Eons of centuries of rust and this was owned by
[10090.51s -> 10092.51s]  Alright, alright, it's unanimous
[10092.51s -> 10098.16s]  Catherine of England. All right, you get you know, that's not all right. We're going you got it done. I
[10098.80s -> 10117.06s]  Am currently on my way. Hey Jeffrey Jeffrey. I need to talk to you. Where are you lad? I'm currently bleeding and
[10118.14s -> 10125.66s]  Profusely from the face and I need some bandages. I need some help here. I'm having fun playing
[10125.66s -> 10130.33s]  I haven't played in a long time. Is everybody even listening to me?
[10131.33s -> 10140.50s]  Hey, hey, look, that's true. Let's work together. Come here buddy. Come here. You didn't get scammed
[10140.50s -> 10144.09s]  Well, I'll add three minutes to the timer. You didn't get scammed
[10144.09s -> 10156.98s]  I promise you didn't get scammed to the Warcraft 3 custom map thing on battle.net
[10157.00s -> 10164.44s]  The only thing you would see was Dota Dota 3.6 Dota 3.06 all-stars Dota Dota Dota Dota Dota
[10164.44s -> 10169.60s]  That's when everybody really started to get into it and I was delicious. Face it. I was really bad at it
[10169.60s -> 10170.60s]  I tried it a few times
[10170.60s -> 10174.20s]  I tried to play for a couple hours on the Dota games and I would just get
[10174.73s -> 10178.65s]  Rocked and it kind of turned me off for the rest of my life
[10178.65s -> 10182.05s]  I'm not wasting if you know was when I was probably 16 or 17 years old
[10182.05s -> 10185.05s]  I'm not wasting a long time ago, but it turned me off from MOBAs
[10185.05s -> 10190.45s]  I never really wanted to get started in them again League of Legends, huh? They're all they all kind of were the same
[10190.45s -> 10194.45s]  They're all that Warcraft 3 Dota that I was terrible at but now
[10194.45s -> 10196.45s]  What? It's you? What are you weirdoing?
[10196.89s -> 10200.09s]  Which I wasn't really that excited for I didn't really read up too much about it
[10200.09s -> 10204.13s]  I just knew it was a new mobile one more I think a mobile like you're out of vetoes man
[10204.13s -> 10209.53s]  I think you got one more on I think a Dota 2 and it just kind of was like I don't want to play all right
[10209.53s -> 10214.41s]  All right. All right. All right. Did I know that this game was WASD to move? All right. All right
[10214.41s -> 10221.68s]  All right person Jesus Christ. He's my using the default scatter gun the Criticola and the Sandman
[10221.84s -> 10228.55s]  This is the first time I've ever equipped the Sandman in a commentary ever and not just a commentary
[10228.55s -> 10232.27s]  I haven't put this thing on probably since it came out back in like
[10232.63s -> 10237.03s]  2008 or 9 whenever they released this thing. I haven't used it once since then
[10237.03s -> 10243.40s]  This is also on CP gravel pit and it's on defense if you couldn't already tell now here
[10243.40s -> 10247.12s]  Let me tell you why I'm playing scout scout on gravel pit on defense
[10247.12s -> 10252.16s]  He's really really awesome because I don't see in the bottom of the screen. They have to cap
[10252.16s -> 10259.86s]  You know veto veto veto good place. I win. This is a good one. Oh fuck. We have to do it again wheel man
[10263.19s -> 10272.28s]  He'll die. Don't worry. God damn it. They're like little mice. You're trying to catch a mice with your bare hands
[10272.96s -> 10274.44s]  There you go. He's dead
[10274.44s -> 10283.43s]  two minutes, oh shit losing down now like I
[10283.95s -> 10286.96s]  Can't believe we skipped
[10287.96s -> 10289.96s]  Shitty this looks
[10290.28s -> 10294.58s]  My streams my god, this is like 2,000 bitrate. It's like 2000 like 15
[10295.28s -> 10303.51s]  This is back before like they I could do that raised the cap again left again
[10303.75s -> 10312.10s]  Think I'm running fucking circles, you know, I mean this is a rumor and doi doi doi. No, it's not
[10312.90s -> 10317.59s]  Rumor has to be somebody driving by it's like perfect dick idiots
[10318.03s -> 10322.57s]  The download counts towards the hour. No, it does not
[10323.11s -> 10326.32s]  You still don't scream in 10 ADP turn this spaghetti
[10326.32s -> 10332.28s]  That's because you need to leave you need a higher bitrate to go higher than 720 if you don't have a higher bitrate
[10332.28s -> 10335.60s]  Then it looks like shit, especially if you're at 60 FPS. I don't scream at 30
[10337.60s -> 10339.60s]  Go, please
[10340.32s -> 10353.95s]  Cops are teleporting by the way wearing the fence. The fence is now part of the car. Nice networks
[10356.97s -> 10363.37s]  transcoding Andy Oh
[10363.89s -> 10369.29s]  How far away is why can't you raise your bitrate? I see this 1080 and 60. Come on
[10369.29s -> 10372.93s]  They probably have a screaming PC. They probably streaming at more than 6,000 do it
[10373.89s -> 10375.89s]  6,000 bitrate 1080p 60 FPS
[10375.93s -> 10381.73s]  Just it doesn't look good motion game like please get there and do it doesn't look good in motion 12 seconds
[10381.93s -> 10383.93s]  You're doing 30 you can do it
[10384.13s -> 10392.67s]  You can do it. I have a 30 90. Yeah, I don't want to get in a circle get in the circle
[10393.39s -> 10397.23s]  Holy shit, relax. What the fuck was that? My mic peaked
[10402.93s -> 10410.94s]  Yeah, I think you guys are in trouble, I don't think you're gonna get another I don't think you're gonna get another 100
[10412.94s -> 10418.13s]  You got about 15 minutes at 5 15
[10421.38s -> 10424.87s]  You're looking for gambling you're looking for Drew crew you're looking for a wink
[10425.61s -> 10428.45s]  Looking for naked you're looking for a room or any room or driving by
[10429.89s -> 10432.09s]  You're looking for an extreme Jax moment
[10432.57s -> 10435.47s]  And even if you get Jax, you still need to get the naked moment, too
[10435.99s -> 10438.00s]  It's a different game
[10438.00s -> 10445.67s]  We go to Tokyo chocolate here. Not yet 10 out of 10 game. By the way, I need to go to Kona
[10445.95s -> 10454.51s]  It's a grandma game. This is a pretty damn fun. Grandma game. It was I don't care grandma games can be fun
[10454.51s -> 10464.74s]  Are you kidding me? Oh, there is gambling in this but you are a grandma fine
[10465.06s -> 10468.57s]  But is it right here? It's too early
[10469.37s -> 10475.19s]  Yeah, I don't think Lee Wonka
[10475.19s -> 10476.61s]  It's a different a different island

[10481.33s -> 10484.25s]  I too am interested in forming a partnership be careful here
[10484.25s -> 10488.81s]  If you use your last life here, you have one more my signing over this you wonder if you have two more
[10489.33s -> 10494.02s]  Take a hundred and twenty cases of your tart of the moon to Zach. I don't really enjoy
[10494.02s -> 10497.30s]  I think the gambling happens one very very much ordering further in this pod
[10497.86s -> 10500.56s]  You have two more you can either extend or you can beat a app store
[10500.86s -> 10506.62s]  I'm staying here because I'm likes my own game. I don't have anybody else hates it, but he's keeping me in business
[10507.26s -> 10514.22s]  It's too late. Yeah, you could veto this in 20 cases. Well, I have to get that ready
[10514.70s -> 10521.93s]  It's far too early for gambling. Even if you extend it twice. God damn it. What do I need?
[10522.33s -> 10527.02s]  Tart of the moon is so such a pain in the ass. No, no, no, it's yeah
[10527.02s -> 10530.02s]  I'm just burning the clock right now against you guys. Okay, I need
[10531.02s -> 10533.50s]  125 lemons I hiked the ball and just went down
[10536.80s -> 10545.49s]  Lemons, okay. Let's go. We need to hold hold. Oh, it's so late to do a veto now
[10545.49s -> 10552.11s]  That would be a waste on the clock pick talk run the clock. I'll take lemons, please
[10552.11s -> 10558.93s]  I need a hundred and twenty five of them too late now. Oh, I love how this is just so slow
[10558.93s -> 10573.70s]  There's nothing happening. This is perfect for me. Perfect. What I just buy let's get a reminder here
[10575.67s -> 10581.63s]  Look like a lemon. No, look at me either. I do that every other stream. I'm surprised even seen it
[10581.63s -> 10587.19s]  It looks like a lemon. I just clicked it and said go whatever. It was a part where click master on every stream, too
[10587.19s -> 10589.19s]  I got eight hundred sixty thousand dollars. Who cares?
[10589.67s -> 10597.77s]  Let me extend at that. I'm making Tart of the moons. All right, I can do better than 21 though
[10597.77s -> 10599.77s]  I said not a crunch time. Let's go
[10600.09s -> 10613.48s]  Okay, come on. This is gambling. No, it's not
[10614.00s -> 10624.21s]  Well, we're gonna go for it cactus. Canyon doesn't like me
[10627.93s -> 10629.93s]  This is that oh, it's absolutely not gonna be
[10630.65s -> 10638.30s]  Nope, that ain't happening. I think our way back again. Oh, I've seen a lot of vetoes here. Yeah until 515 repeat
[10638.74s -> 10645.32s]  Can we do it? Although wait a minute. Hold on and here we go. I'm not gonna pay attention to me
[10645.32s -> 10649.82s]  Oh, I'm done. Okay. There's a lot of going on here. This is gonna be tough
[10650.46s -> 10656.74s]  By the way, if a veto does come through you get the full hundred eighty seconds again. Just make sure you understand that
[10660.74s -> 10662.10s]  Wait
[10662.10s -> 10669.05s]  Cactus candy was so good. Get him out of here. This seems pretty unanimous so far
[10669.65s -> 10674.60s]  You give me that over. All right, you give me that over and things are gonna change. Oh
[10677.31s -> 10683.62s]  Thanks for hanging out run up the stairs on all fours. I can do that. No, I'm not gonna do that
[10683.82s -> 10689.46s]  I'm not going to do that slide down the stairs
[10689.46s -> 10694.40s]  You want to make like a sled and go down the stairs? What are we looking for? What do we have a chance?
[10694.68s -> 10701.65s]  What am I gonna use for sled? You know, I could probably use the like what we use the bed sheet
[10701.65s -> 10706.23s]  This is the dumb actually be possible. I might actually be that makes me be easy
[10707.92s -> 10718.36s]  No, this is all shit. Okay. Oh, right. I don't know. How long is this? Oh, no, that's his opportunity here
[10718.56s -> 10747.65s]  What am I doing? Oh shit, it's an extension. What a weirdo. What are you doing? Oh, no, it's gonna happen, isn't it?
[10747.65s -> 10764.27s]  I don't know when it happens though
[10765.63s -> 10773.07s]  Fucking shit was in there. There was like a bunch of costumes. Why is this Vaughn so shitty?
[10773.23s -> 10788.70s]  Do I know that I'm live why does it look like I don't even know the camera's on did I think I turned the stream off?
[10802.38s -> 10821.55s]  I can't even hear it make a dinosaur to clay. Yeah, I know I'm extending
[10844.45s -> 10850.66s]  You were so thin and young this is like three years ago guys
[10859.26s -> 10861.26s]  I don't know
[10861.70s -> 10862.90s]  Okay
[10862.90s -> 10871.57s]  Will it happen in the next three minutes? Thank you. I need to put the mic back up to my mouth
[10871.57s -> 10877.31s]  What am I doing? So much you aged like milk. Um, excuse me. I don't think so Mike
[10879.86s -> 10884.58s]  I've aged like a fucker. I think I've aged like fucking blue cheese, which is moldy and old, but it's fucking delicious
[10884.58s -> 10886.82s]  What is this on me? Oh
[10889.60s -> 10894.53s]  ghost ectoplasm
[10895.09s -> 10898.27s]  Fuck is that?
[10899.19s -> 10907.80s]  He slimed me there was like a cobweb that was like a spider web that was fucked up
[10911.89s -> 10919.07s]  Anything you didn't hear anything. I actually kind of like this little microphone, right? I like it
[10919.07s -> 10924.24s]  I it's fun. There's a spider in here somewhere
[10924.24s -> 10928.40s]  Probably I probably ran it over when I was doing the fucking six sled move that you guys just saw
[10928.48s -> 10938.14s]  You're drunk is fucking this am I do a ghost hunt stream. Is it where is this where do the magic tricks closets?
[10941.39s -> 10947.91s]  Those might do the magic trick where I unplug my router on camera and plug it back in and like it turns the stream off
[10947.91s -> 10952.43s]  But it like doesn't write the paint cans that he has in his basement. I just disappear off cringe
[10955.25s -> 10966.74s]  You extending again. Oh, this is risky. I can't do a house tour guys. I can't believe that worked
[10966.74s -> 10968.86s]  I unplugged the ethernet from my router
[10970.86s -> 10976.06s]  And I would plug it back in and sprint out of the fucking room and I would just disappear why was that happening?
[10981.09s -> 10989.69s]  This just like scraped my nose all in we're trying to do anything right now
[10989.69s -> 11001.89s]  I have been trying to kill time here for like in a fucking hour almost and it's still not working. Look at me
[11001.89s -> 11007.50s]  Oh, yeah, it's it's off. Do I like pretend to take my shirt off do this?
[11007.62s -> 11013.41s]  Like can you guys hear my stomach you want to see if we could let you want me to do like an endoscopy?
[11013.41s -> 11033.97s]  See, let's see if you guys can hear inside my like esophagus. Could you could you hear it? It's loud inside
[11033.97s -> 11045.02s]  Hold on. What are you doing?
[11054.48s -> 11058.70s]  Screaming
[11064.42s -> 11071.98s]  Everybody's waiting for it. I don't know what's gonna happen though. Ears are dead. Really? I turned it down so low too
[11071.98s -> 11083.98s]  I'm so sorry blame
[11083.98s -> 11096.54s]  This is such a cursed stream. It was gross. It probably was how was my birthday pretty sick
[11096.54s -> 11104.59s]  So wait, okay. Hold on a second if you guys are out of extensions, that's it
[11104.79s -> 11113.88s]  We're good. You're not gonna see the thing you think you're gonna see. I don't
[11123.58s -> 11137.18s]  What are you talking about Lincoln I would say probably
[11137.62s -> 11144.14s]  Face probably Jefferson Grover Cleveland. I saw Grover Cleveland. You were fucked up three years ago
[11144.14s -> 11146.78s]  I can be a pretty good Lincoln. I think from this angle
[11149.08s -> 11151.08s]  Lincoln was I had a full bald head, right?
[11153.18s -> 11158.62s]  Lincoln Lincoln had like a ponytail, right? So Lincoln had like a bun ponytail up here
[11158.78s -> 11166.20s]  Okay, and he had like these long you get another one here. I get another one like that
[11166.20s -> 11174.34s]  If you get another one, I get another one too down here. You really want to make that trade. Do you want to extend?
[11174.34s -> 11186.76s]  Put it up. So, um, you got ten minutes
[11188.86s -> 11192.00s]  Looks like I can close my eyes and see him
[11192.60s -> 11196.52s]  Big eyes up here two big eyes
[11198.12s -> 11204.95s]  blue fur the cookie monster his mouth opens like this that he's got the no nose and
[11206.07s -> 11211.90s]  That's uh, he's eating cookies eating cookies a lot of are we doing it? Hey, right? Okay
[11214.68s -> 11221.10s]  Do you guys want to see it so bad? I don't know if it's gonna happen though. I get another one, too
[11225.78s -> 11227.78s]  Among us character on the whiteboard
[11234.30s -> 11236.62s]  Except a side profile of red
[11237.50s -> 11239.50s]  Is that what you mean?
[11242.22s -> 11249.79s]  That's so fucking funny, I'm gonna go just rage eat no, I'm not supposed to be angry about this
[11249.79s -> 11251.07s]  Oh, by the way, everybody
[11251.07s -> 11255.53s]  I have a lot of work to do you got so much work you've extended but I've got I've
[11256.13s -> 11258.13s]  Received into my bank account of veto
[11259.13s -> 11266.34s]  Interesting so I could veto this right now. It's there interesting. Well this camera angle cuz I can't even unplug
[11267.22s -> 11273.98s]  And tell you you don't need to know when I want to use my video I could use it whenever I want typing into
[11273.98s -> 11280.76s]  Google buzz feed quiz and I don't even care what the first one is. That's the one we're gonna do
[11280.88s -> 11286.37s]  Okay, take this pizza pizza quiz. Take this pizza quiz. How's my punch the camera?
[11286.37s -> 11293.68s]  We'll reveal your mental and actual age pick. Okay. Hold on a minute. Let me get this on screen
[11293.68s -> 11297.48s]  We're gonna do a pizza quiz. It would be stupid. Nobody gets anything
[11301.10s -> 11312.28s]  I'm gonna hold it because I know everyone's waiting for like the look of me poses and shit that I'm gonna do
[11312.28s -> 11314.60s]  But it's I don't think it happens and they already think it already did happen
[11316.47s -> 11325.35s]  Yeah, I think you guys I think you guys screwed they're gonna get my age here
[11325.35s -> 11332.37s]  They're gonna get my mental age and my physical age. She was laying on the whiteboard
[11332.37s -> 11340.88s]  Oh you guys are you guys just blew through two extensions three extensions. It's over and I and you gave me a veto
[11340.88s -> 11348.31s]  It happens at 29 minutes. Oh, no
[11350.13s -> 11359.58s]  No, I'm the star. It was an opportunity for like a pose. I think this still is an opportunity
[11359.58s -> 11366.31s]  We got meat lovers seafood. Who the fuck is ordering seafood on their pizza? Yeah, I agree. That's that's weird
[11366.31s -> 11381.39s]  What's on there? I don't like that dinosaur feet on here. No, absolutely not preem. It's a bad take. Whatever
[11382.15s -> 11387.25s]  It's fine. Give me a bad take lovers. There's no meat on here meat lovers sucks. It falls apart
[11387.25s -> 11389.97s]  It's like be you're eating a lasagna barbecue chicken
[11390.73s -> 11395.37s]  Are we kids all right pepperoni that's pretty good, but who the fuck who the fuck was put who put the olives
[11395.89s -> 11399.98s]  walks slime rancher
[11399.98s -> 11410.34s]  What else should I do here? I could buy another plot. Wait, they're actually my I'm this was peel growth. Let's go
[11410.62s -> 11414.80s]  Yeah, this is peak like poses and doy-doy-doys and shit. I might get rid of this
[11414.80s -> 11422.21s]  Oh, yeah, I remember I'm soft lock myself in here, right? Okay. So what's over here? Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice
[11422.21s -> 11428.15s]  Why is the camera so bad looks awful in a rooster get a rooster? Well, there's no roosters over here
[11428.83s -> 11439.14s]  What plots it's always been this bad what not this bad I built this area myself
[11439.26s -> 11444.57s]  I'm just dumping an entire coffee on my ground on my desk and everything. I already did that
[11444.57s -> 11446.33s]  It's just this just like makes me feel cool
[11446.33s -> 11451.80s]  I still can't believe I actually did that earlier like a couple hours ago. Remember get a rooster
[11451.80s -> 11457.74s]  I will that sucks because it's been so clean in here. It really has and now it's gonna be like gross coffee
[11457.74s -> 11461.53s]  It's not about coffee spills. I don't know what the vile
[11462.49s -> 11465.17s]  Disgusting properties like enzymes and coffee or whatever
[11465.25s -> 11474.79s]  But when you spill coffee and it dries it smells like that dirty fucking ass garbage can it's
[11475.31s -> 11483.01s]  Disgusting milk. I don't I don't put milk in my coffee, but it still does that it just smells like just like just
[11483.61s -> 11488.42s]  decaying dead flesh or something. I'm gonna clean this again when I'm done
[11491.41s -> 11497.13s]  You look so young dude. This was this was like
[11498.73s -> 11500.73s]  Seven months ago
[11503.82s -> 11505.82s]  I just have a shaved face
[11507.34s -> 11510.86s]  I have a shaved face and a haircut
[11518.62s -> 11521.56s]  It's kind of weird because you guys have a real-time vision of
[11522.18s -> 11527.58s]  Decades plus of my life. So there will be a point where I kind of look old, right?
[11527.58s -> 11534.01s]  It's but maybe it's starting to happen too. You have a barometer of a decade plus of on-camera shit
[11534.05s -> 11539.41s]  You'll be able to know the moment that I turn old

[11666.17s -> 11669.69s]  I'll save my century. Thank you Marcus van machinery. You are
[11670.81s -> 11676.29s]  Machinery. Yeah machine. Am I even saying that word right? All right. I'm feeling generous
[11676.29s -> 11682.53s]  I didn't know how to pronounce the machinist with Christian Bale. I thought it was called the mechanic. We each get two more vetoes
[11683.41s -> 11685.41s]  The mechanist let's go
[11685.73s -> 11692.29s]  We each get two more vetoes or extension. Oh my god that guy. He's killed. Let's go. How is that guy still up there?
[11692.93s -> 11695.13s]  Yeah, you know where to go the gates closed behind them
[11696.85s -> 11701.23s]  Kind of trapped we're supposed to be over. Oh, yeah, we're supposed to be over but I've just I did my ultimate extension
[11701.77s -> 11705.53s]  They're coming through the tunnels use one to go back. That's not how this program works
[11707.05s -> 11717.13s]  No deal. What do you mean? No deal the devil man is devil man up in that top left. He's being a real prick
[11717.49s -> 11719.49s]  Yeah, there's a heavy up there in a medic
[11719.97s -> 11724.81s]  This is the bonus round stuff. We're in bonus round territory. Have you said look
[11724.97s -> 11726.25s]  Oh
[11726.25s -> 11728.25s]  Look at how close you are
[11729.05s -> 11731.05s]  You really want to throw the opportunity away
[11733.05s -> 11739.05s]  Me you already won once see look at that. Look at that. It's all right there. What's the pyro pyro spy spy spy?
[11740.09s -> 11742.52s]  All right, let's go
[11744.80s -> 11751.04s]  No deal means the stream turns off have you guys speaking yourself you're doing that. Thank you you guys double enough
[11752.64s -> 11754.64s]  Wait a minute
[11756.20s -> 11758.20s]  What do I get
[11760.48s -> 11767.64s]  So if you get okay, how about this we're gonna remove all here's what we're doing we're gonna remove all
[11768.40s -> 11770.40s]  vetoes all extensions
[11770.52s -> 11774.28s]  Nobody can do shit. I'm gonna do the randomizer five more times
[11774.88s -> 11783.31s]  If it hits I actually want to veto this one. Why is why is the world shaking?
[11783.55s -> 11788.19s]  I
[11788.19s -> 11793.54s]  Can hear noises that I don't like to hear. I'm not naked. I have I'm just sunburned
[11795.45s -> 11800.58s]  What's that? What's this like fairy dust on the ground? Oh, this is roller skates
[11805.43s -> 11812.19s]  Sick I got like the roller skates I can compete in like the roller derby. I'm not naked
[11813.11s -> 11818.90s]  Alright, no vetoes five. This is good. This included this one four more rolls and that's it
[11818.90s -> 11826.97s]  I don't know what it was back in the old YouTube days. I was always red
[11827.73s -> 11829.97s]  Was always just sunburned every single video
[11833.57s -> 11842.19s]  Scares already up there
[11847.30s -> 11852.44s]  If I still had a veto I would get rid of it right now I swear to God it's gone
[11852.44s -> 11858.98s]  What is what is that? It's not there anymore. Is this before your nose job?
[11862.10s -> 11868.25s]  Body just tensed up. I feel I just lifted 200 pounds of weight
[11871.24s -> 11877.42s]  All my reps for like the week. Excuse me. It's like the thing with like the the flaming
[11877.98s -> 11879.98s]  Dr. Doom skull was looking at me
[11888.79s -> 11893.23s]  Why aren't you buff anymore, I don't know because I'm in my 30s indication of where you're
[11894.19s -> 11900.55s]  30s because in this video, I'm like in my mid 20s and I'm fucking jacked and sunburned
[11900.55s -> 11904.11s]  I would had so much vitamin D in my body that it was making my skin red
[11905.07s -> 11910.18s]  Okay, I'm in my 30s you some land
[11920.59s -> 11926.03s]  Any more of this that's not a pog
[11934.19s -> 11948.19s]  It's a pog face it's pog. Oh, no, this is getting hard now. Oh, yeah. Yeah
[11948.19s -> 11951.75s]  How long has it been I've only been recording for five minutes
[11952.47s -> 11962.77s]  Well, doesn't do anything. It's just kind of there for fun. Everyone got a new hat to new sunglasses
[11963.45s -> 11966.55s]  New new hat and every oh snooze
[11967.53s -> 11970.85s]  Human revolutions news. This is gonna be fucking boring
[11970.85s -> 11977.25s]  I can't veto this all these items if you pre-order Deus ex the new Deus ex game or you can find them in drops and they
[11977.25s -> 11981.33s]  Are craftable if I laugh at this I will give a hundred subs because I wanted Deus ex anyways
[11981.61s -> 11986.05s]  So let's get into this guys here. We're gonna start with the engineer and the new engineer items
[11986.25s -> 11992.61s]  Let's start by saying that this is a very very odd mechanic. Take a look at my ammo count down there
[11992.61s -> 11998.51s]  It takes 60 ammo to shoot it. You do not have a clip anymore. There's no reloading. There's no
[11999.21s -> 12001.41s]  Reload time or anything like that. It's just
[12001.89s -> 12007.17s]  60 metal to shoot that gun and it's 35 metal to shoot the new pistol
[12007.45s -> 12009.45s]  Very very weird mechanic because
[12009.49s -> 12014.77s]  You'll find that you'll have no more metal left to shoot the gun and you're kind of just like oh crap
[12014.77s -> 12015.57s]  Now what do I do?
[12015.57s -> 12018.65s]  It's gonna take a lot of getting used to but for a combat engineer
[12018.65s -> 12021.09s]  This will be a awesome new item
[12021.49s -> 12027.13s]  Especially the new shotgun because how many times have you been able to not place a mini century down when you wanted to?
[12027.25s -> 12030.73s]  Because you didn't have enough ammo or metal see look at my ammo count
[12031.41s -> 12038.73s]  113 96 you shoot you lose but you gain it's weird and then this new item here this new pistol it electrocutes people
[12038.73s -> 12040.09s]  It's very very odd
[12040.09s -> 12043.49s]  Hopefully we can figure this all out guys in the near future in the next couple weeks
[12043.53s -> 12050.07s]  It works on buildings as well. So if you shoot a building, I believe point-blank it gives you let's see here
[12050.07s -> 12056.81s]  I think it's I think it's 80 to 85 metal per point-blank shot. So I electrocute this sniper
[12056.89s -> 12063.13s]  It's kind of a weird we can't it's it's like a tesla coil kind of and it spreads I didn't want to show myself lose
[12063.13s -> 12067.57s]  You electrocute somebody I was getting killed around it will hit I cut single person around there
[12067.73s -> 12073.37s]  This also destroys projectiles the new pistol see how I shot that building how I did watch a see
[12073.45s -> 12079.49s]  Plus 60 plus 60 if you get close enough to people it's sort of like having infinite ammo and you never have to reload
[12079.53s -> 12086.21s]  But the problem here guys is you have to be a good shot if you miss all the time if you're not good with the shotgun
[12086.25s -> 12091.65s]  I do not recommend you try and get this item because you will just lose metal over and over again
[12091.85s -> 12097.29s]  So I get a little assist with that thing. It's very weird see 60 60 60 80 80
[12097.29s -> 12101.29s]  It's very very cool. See look see how this thing is spreading. The electrical charge is spreading around
[12101.61s -> 12106.37s]  Maybe it's a new spy check mechanic. Maybe you can check for spies. I'm not sure yet guys
[12106.37s -> 12108.41s]  This is the first time I've ever played with it
[12108.65s -> 12112.77s]  Just want to make sure I get you guys some cool gameplay with it. You see exactly how the item works
[12112.77s -> 12119.01s]  I haven't tried to destroy any projectiles with it yet with the with the pistol because I hadn't I didn't really have a chance to be
[12119.01s -> 12121.49s]  Honest so trying to get that to work
[12121.49s -> 12127.09s]  I'm assuming that it's sort of like a reflect you just click it just did it did it did it you just click once and
[12127.09s -> 12131.41s]  That's it. Let's move on to the spy. This is really really cool. You'll see I think I'm all right
[12131.41s -> 12136.01s]  I decloak next to this century over here. It doesn't matter like I'm all right mini century
[12136.01s -> 12140.21s]  It can be a big century backstab the engine. Thank God. Okay, please
[12140.89s -> 12142.65s]  Thank God
[12142.65s -> 12144.65s]  People were saying these clips are so bad
[12144.89s -> 12155.07s]  Guys wake up at 5 a.m. Some of you do e3 2019
[12160.42s -> 12168.54s]  Well, most do you get up at like 11 10, you know, why some of you especially during the summertime, you know
[12168.54s -> 12174.31s]  I've got that got demographics. I actually do page. I know I know
[12176.39s -> 12178.87s]  Count Olaf hair. Well, I look so much worse
[12181.25s -> 12186.25s]  I look so much better over here. I mean, I'm getting that haircut again
[12191.64s -> 12199.96s]  When I was in college, I don't get up till fucking like 6 p.m. So you look dirty
[12199.96s -> 12207.40s]  Oh, yeah, we get up at 5 every day. I don't look dirty. Who's older. Sorry the data says otherwise
[12207.76s -> 12218.96s]  How do we know how old you are? I just have a beard. I have morning classes. Not right now. I wink here
[12218.96s -> 12222.52s]  What are you in that you wouldn't high school or college right now?
[12224.82s -> 12229.64s]  You're out or into this you're at school
[12230.16s -> 12233.58s]  You got up at like fucking 8 o'clock this afternoon Hugh Hefner
[12238.16s -> 12244.68s]  That's how you can tell I fucking stay up really late 8 p.m. Is like in the middle of the afternoon old German that smells better
[12245.20s -> 12250.94s]  Mmm, I don't think so. I think we smell about the same. I stayed up all night
[12250.94s -> 12254.10s]  I was thinking about doing that because I didn't want to miss this because I really
[12255.10s -> 12257.10s]  We got three more
[12259.62s -> 12262.62s]  Left arm is creepy. Why cuz I'm wearing a bathrobe
[12269.10s -> 12271.60s]  There's no wink I would have been delirious
[12275.88s -> 12281.68s]  Lipstick no, it's called that. My lips are always dry. So I have to always put an application on right now
[12283.52s -> 12296.43s]  I've a lot of different looks guys, although I haven't worn a suit and probably ten years
[12296.77s -> 12302.23s]  Well, you should do that. I've done that before and it's I just okay. Do you remember the first?
[12303.16s -> 12307.37s]  15 to 20 minutes of this stream go watch it
[12308.41s -> 12311.55s]  Look like you drink blood. Let's go. But do you remember go watch that?
[12311.55s -> 12315.81s]  I was sitting here just turning the stream on just barely had woken up and I'm just like I
[12317.27s -> 12319.39s]  I was weird. I was a weirdo
[12320.03s -> 12322.47s]  In a cap, but there's no reason for me to be here
[12322.47s -> 12326.31s]  I'm gonna try and pick off people that come out of the spawn and nobody really comes out
[12327.07s -> 12333.55s]  Again no reactions at all zero emotion or I'll give the hundreds of trying to find somebody that I can't shoot that guy
[12333.55s -> 12334.45s]  I can't shoot that guy
[12334.45s -> 12337.47s]  So I just go over to the right side of the spawn and I end up getting a heavy
[12337.59s -> 12343.19s]  He just kind of comes out and he just bang gets him right there. That's gonna be the end of the gameplay guys
[12343.67s -> 12347.07s]  Thank you all so much for watching. I really appreciate all the support over
[12347.71s -> 12351.83s]  So I'll see you all next time and take care everybody. That was a great gameplay
[12352.47s -> 12363.08s]  That one doesn't count. Yeah, actually does not count. Oops
[12363.56s -> 12366.95s]  It's not over. No, it's not that doesn't count
[12367.31s -> 12372.01s]  Tris to game play commentary and tonight
[12372.01s -> 12376.17s]  I don't plan as the demo man with the stuff that's on the screen right now
[12376.17s -> 12379.21s]  I believe it's the strange lock and load the charge and torch and the
[12379.53s -> 12385.85s]  Islander strange Islander and of course you got a hats and crap the miscellaneous whatever battery canteen
[12385.85s -> 12391.77s]  I don't want to give advice. No, it's an advice video not really to do about the game. It's an advice video
[12391.81s -> 12399.18s]  What's the advice fortress to specifically how to get better at landing your pipe? Oh, no, no, no anything in this game
[12399.18s -> 12401.74s]  No, no, no as travel time. No, no
[12402.74s -> 12407.26s]  No, although this will probably help you out with your skits his skit scan
[12407.26s -> 12410.10s]  What the hell was I gonna just say with your hit scan as well?
[12410.26s -> 12416.28s]  But it's mainly gonna focus on the travel time things like the demo man pipes all the checks moment
[12416.28s -> 12419.40s]  And even the syringe gun this could probably help you out with the syringe gun as well
[12419.48s -> 12422.24s]  And what it is, it's TR walkway
[12423.04s -> 12429.40s]  I didn't know anything about this map for the longest time and just very recent. Wait, we don't have that there was no
[12431.04s -> 12436.24s]  Deal it's a map you can play pretty much by yourself deals begins now and shooting bots no laughing
[12436.24s -> 12439.56s]  It might seem like the most mundane boring thing in the world
[12439.64s -> 12443.42s]  But it actually is pretty addicting and they just keep coming out and you're on the red team
[12443.42s -> 12448.36s]  They're on the blue team and it's just they walk in a straight line straight at you and you can kind of make some
[12448.88s -> 12453.64s]  Adjustments you can make them do jumps. You can make them move in a different direction and it's pretty fun
[12453.64s -> 12457.36s]  You'll find yourself just sitting there for what seems like hours
[12457.92s -> 12463.92s]  Shooting at these bots and it's so important that you do this for a while and you practice inside a TR walkway
[12463.92s -> 12470.52s]  This is good. Eventually your memory will get down to a point where you know exactly where to put this is not cringe
[12470.52s -> 12474.88s]  This is actually good advice. You'll go. Oh, this guy's moving in the direction that I'm used to
[12474.88s -> 12479.08s]  I know where I'm supposed to place this because I know exactly how it's going to move
[12479.08s -> 12483.80s]  I know how the trajectory is gonna go and it's gonna hit the guy and he's gonna die and I'm gonna get more points
[12483.80s -> 12491.09s]  and I'm gonna do better in team fortress 2 and I mentioned why it's so important to be good advice is cringe because
[12492.01s -> 12494.85s]  Everybody always says that to get better in the game
[12494.85s -> 12497.09s]  You got to play you got to practice to get better
[12497.09s -> 12498.45s]  You just play and you get better
[12498.45s -> 12503.21s]  But it can be pretty damn hard sometimes because when you get into a server and there's a bunch of people that are way better
[12503.25s -> 12507.09s]  Than you you're not gonna get to practice your rocket launcher
[12507.45s -> 12511.45s]  Shots because they're gonna just kill you in less than a second. So true. You're gonna start to feel bad
[12511.45s -> 12514.89s]  So what did the bots don't attack back is the main thing?
[12514.89s -> 12518.25s]  They just move and you can practice and it's a way better
[12518.61s -> 12523.41s]  Environment and a way better place to get comfortable with the way that these weapons actually work. That's right
[12523.41s -> 12523.73s]  Yeah
[12523.73s -> 12529.37s]  You don't have to feel so pressured by going up against these guys that have been playing forever that I know everything about every class
[12529.37s -> 12535.09s]  You can take your time with it and just sit sort of in a corner and just get used to the way the
[12535.49s -> 12539.49s]  TF2 was out for three weeks after I made that, you know, I come on
[12540.57s -> 12547.57s]  The game came out two weeks ago according to this video is one thing but my pipes landed with demo man has gone up
[12548.49s -> 12550.49s]  Significantly, we got two more
[12551.81s -> 12559.21s]  He said I'm gonna give you mortality and send you back to earth to solve the world's problems
[12559.41s -> 12561.65s]  And I said, okay
[12561.89s -> 12568.61s]  Send me back Roger that and I arrived in a basket at the Denver School for baby
[12568.73s -> 12577.11s]  Ninja frog people and I befriended your frogs and they said thank you and I said except for one frog named
[12577.11s -> 12583.99s]  Timmy he used to make I can't veto anymore. He's dead. He's been dead for 70 years. Holy shit
[12584.95s -> 12591.46s]  Let me look at my calendar here the fucking these drawings there's German's birth. There's my birthday
[12591.98s -> 12597.96s]  Wow, really? It's been like 82 years since I killed Timmy. Hope his parents aren't that mad at me
[12597.96s -> 12603.36s]  Whatever. Let's get back into this. So I got a job selling old shoes or
[12604.20s -> 12608.80s]  Well, you can put whatever you want here cuz I didn't have a job for the last like probably 40 years
[12608.80s -> 12614.24s]  I got a job at the fishing dock. I was the guy that peeled all the fishes scales off
[12614.24s -> 12617.40s]  I used to eat them and might be weird to a lot of you guys
[12617.40s -> 12621.36s]  But do you think I give a fuck and then came my adult life?
[12623.20s -> 12630.64s]  You've never seen you've never seen quite an action-packed adventure like this one
[12631.04s -> 12635.96s]  Gather your friends and explore the wonderful land of Azeroth
[12635.96s -> 12640.55s]  I actually don't there's context for these videos
[12640.87s -> 12646.41s]  I'm about to pause this motherfucker right now and again drop some knowledge on you all okay
[12647.29s -> 12653.05s]  2002 listen, all right listen to me out of an airplane there and Insta died on the concrete
[12654.09s -> 12659.49s]  Oh, we're gonna pause this we're gonna pause the timer too. It doesn't matter. There's not even as much time left in the video
[12659.75s -> 12665.58s]  Okay, so a long time ago. I had this character named grandpa, right grandpa
[12665.58s -> 12669.58s]  I made videos for machinima and they did really really well
[12669.58s -> 12673.82s]  I made like grandpa as an MLG pro and holy fuck people loved it
[12674.32s -> 12677.74s]  I got like two hundred thousand views and remember I was like a
[12678.61s -> 12682.65s]  I got that guy was like a thousand two thousand three thousand views a video on my youtube channel
[12683.01s -> 12686.33s]  So holy fucking smokes. I just leaned into it
[12686.33s -> 12692.72s]  I leaned into it hard and I made like fucking 20 of these so I was holy shit people like this
[12692.72s -> 12699.87s]  I'm gonna keep making more of these grandpa videos, so that's why this is here people wanted to know more about them
[12699.87s -> 12705.50s]  I don't guys I canonically killed this character twice
[12706.30s -> 12714.56s]  Grandpa's dead. He's been kin. He's canonically gone from the universe into heaven and then here's a funny story guys
[12714.56s -> 12719.32s]  I was in Moses's science class and guess who sits behind me, but God himself
[12719.44s -> 12724.04s]  I walked up to him after class at his locker, and I just simply asked him God
[12724.04s -> 12729.38s]  You know could I have like five more years on earth just Peter Griffin had to trade my fucking lunchables for it
[12729.38s -> 12744.68s]  But I'm here. I don't even need to do that. Oh, it's super toothless. Joe. Whatever his name is these guys freaked me out
[12744.96s -> 12753.39s]  This is scary, this is a long time ago. I've had all the warhammer games for a pretty long time
[12754.61s -> 12763.20s]  Super super yeah, you are a fan of super yes, I would highly recommend you get the original dawn of war I
[12764.21s -> 12768.41s]  Wasn't a fan of dawn of war 2 this is my old Isaac better than the new Isaac
[12768.41s -> 12773.81s]  It was a good game, but I don't think it was nearly as good as dawn of war 1. What is this and?
[12774.53s -> 12776.53s]  Grandpa tries
[12777.29s -> 12784.75s]  Come on come right here come on you want to talk about leaning into it come on same error and soda and
[12785.64s -> 12788.56s]  Holy shit, this is the same era. I wasn't making that up
[12792.47s -> 12794.81s]  We need to find that part
[12794.81s -> 12799.72s]  Fuck the timer. I'm freezing this
[12800.10s -> 12807.16s]  I'm literally gonna find where grandpa plays cuz I want to show you guys what it really means to like grab on to something
[12807.16s -> 12811.58s]  And fucking lean into it
[12812.26s -> 12817.52s]  In the title it's in the title of the video so that means you know

[12820.72s -> 12825.20s]  It's probably less than 20 seconds in the actual video. Where is it?
[12833.10s -> 12841.12s]  Where's grandpa you know what we might even do it again good position times
[12843.02s -> 12851.53s]  Lean into the sus guy you don't think I've learned my lesson by now. Um I've learned my lesson

[13068.65s -> 13070.65s]  Anybody find that one
[13071.49s -> 13075.81s]  All right, let's go back to what we were doing. I'm telling you I leaned into it
[13075.81s -> 13080.00s]  A lot of you guys can't it stayed on this channel for grandpa
[13080.64s -> 13087.81s]  Actually, you know, I can't talk shit about grandpa literally launch pad my entire career online
[13088.05s -> 13095.10s]  If it wasn't for grandpa, I don't even think I would have grown at the rate that I did I really don't think so
[13095.10s -> 13098.08s]  I went from like
[13098.08s -> 13103.72s]  5,000 view youtuber to like getting hundreds of thousands of views on videos because grandpa was in them
[13103.72s -> 13116.63s]  It was springboarded my whole career. I can't hate grandpa. I core I can't somebody found it. Okay. Well, we'll watch it in a second
[13118.40s -> 13135.98s]  Let's go. We have two more and then that's it. I'm done. Here we go. Turn the timer on we got two more of these
[13136.34s -> 13139.03s]  No, don't turn that off you idiot
[13143.55s -> 13146.11s]  invasion stuff German versus star and the
[13147.75s -> 13153.56s]  Really easy just to turn your brain off and if grandpa shows up, I'm fucking leaving
[13157.04s -> 13162.97s]  I'm gonna play Diablo 3 just kind of run around and swirl when people maybe
[13163.41s -> 13168.97s]  Maybe I'll play like Hearthstone and be terrible. No, I veto this whole
[13170.73s -> 13173.25s]  Delete this stream delete it like what's
[13175.63s -> 13182.15s]  German and versus star in versus TF to wait German versus star versus TF to in binding of Isaac
[13182.15s -> 13186.82s]  What's that title supposed to mean? I don't have a game to show you look at this old
[13187.30s -> 13197.83s]  Like starting soon screen. I can either play Hearthstone and be terrible binding of Isaac or Diablo. Which one?
[13198.19s -> 13204.56s]  Those are all awful choices. I would honestly if I'm in the stream. I'm hitting the X
[13204.56s -> 13211.96s]  I'm gonna warn you guys watching me play Hearthstone is going to drive a ton of you crazy. I didn't even hear that
[13211.96s -> 13215.62s]  I've been gone for at least 30 seconds. Let's do a
[13215.90s -> 13217.94s]  I'll come back and see if he's playing Isaac later
[13217.94s -> 13228.22s]  I'm gonna do one of those fancy poles that you see from time to time. He couldn't do comedy without grandpa
[13228.86s -> 13236.88s]  Grandpa was sort of a an outlet to be a weirdo. He really was changing
[13236.88s -> 13241.44s]  I didn't even guys I didn't there was a period from when I first started doing videos
[13241.44s -> 13249.99s]  I started out kind of like vulgar like I did like vulgar like swears and stuff and then like six months after I started YouTube
[13250.03s -> 13251.86s]  I
[13251.86s -> 13253.86s]  Went to no swears
[13254.48s -> 13258.36s]  Completely like PG PG 13. I didn't say okay. I didn't say shit
[13258.36s -> 13262.64s]  I said like crap and like oh like freaking and stuff. I didn't swear
[13262.64s -> 13269.33s]  I used grandpa as a means to just say and do whatever I wanted and we have you have
[13269.93s -> 13271.21s]  30 seconds to vote by the way
[13271.21s -> 13276.71s]  You have 30 seconds to vote on this ball because it's grandpa is not me
[13276.83s -> 13285.87s]  It was a period of like at least a year or two where I didn't swear and then stir made a video of all this
[13286.15s -> 13287.35s]  Footage
[13287.35s -> 13288.96s]  destroying everything
[13288.96s -> 13294.24s]  stir made a video of all of all this footage of like him recording me and like being in like me freaking out and like saying
[13294.24s -> 13295.80s]  swears and just kind of
[13295.80s -> 13298.61s]  Uncensored and then I couldn't be that guy anymore
[13298.77s -> 13305.23s]  you know what I mean when you have me like calling stir like a piece of fucking garbage and I'm like I
[13305.75s -> 13307.23s]  fucking want to like
[13307.23s -> 13311.80s]  Attack him with like a fucking hammer or whatever like I'm gonna put cigarettes out like you know what I mean
[13311.80s -> 13318.74s]  Like you can't be the guy that doesn't swear anymore after that. Well, I could not keep that up after that
[13318.74s -> 13325.52s]  It was exposed
[13327.20s -> 13333.44s]  Give me a real tree, please. God damn it. Why could you get mad at real trees? What the fuck are these?
[13333.92s -> 13335.92s]  How do you get mad at minecraft trees?
[13336.32s -> 13343.24s]  How do you keep fucking knife and I'm stabbing a motherfucker in the chest? I swear to God
[13343.60s -> 13345.60s]  What the fuck are you talking about? What?
[13346.00s -> 13347.56s]  What is he saying?
[13347.56s -> 13358.69s]  What?
[13358.69s -> 13360.45s]  Shit-faced
[13360.45s -> 13373.43s]  Eat my asshole. Seriously my god. I have to feed on this one. How was that an apple?
[13379.54s -> 13381.74s]  What's wrong with me why am I so mad
[13382.62s -> 13396.83s]  Where's PG Jerma blame stir?
[13397.19s -> 13403.15s]  He caught me on camera talking about like cigarettes butts being put on like my dick and shit and I was over I turned into
[13403.15s -> 13405.99s]  This guy I would have been like PG Andy. I
[13406.99s -> 13410.23s]  Would have my career. I want to know what my career would have looked like after that
[13411.43s -> 13414.25s]  Digging straight down. Yeah, that's fine. We'll be fine
[13414.25s -> 13422.72s]  I would probably have like a hundred million views on my videos playing fortnight, you know
[13422.72s -> 13424.28s]  I would have been like I would just I don't know
[13424.28s -> 13440.33s]  What would I have done some armor if I didn't go down that route God road would I've been on he's still here
[13445.28s -> 13450.34s]  Stir saved this channel. I
[13451.46s -> 13456.61s]  Don't think I would have done that though. Now. Let's go get some let's go get some goddamn armor
[13456.61s -> 13457.41s]  What do you say? Well, I don't know
[13457.49s -> 13464.86s]  I can't tell you the different like multiverses would I have okay if stir didn't make Jerma is mad one two three and four
[13464.86s -> 13476.14s]  I mean how would I have been playing among us and leaned into the sus guy? Jesus? That's something to think about
[13476.38s -> 13488.82s]  What is that noise? What the fuck is this noise? Why does it look like ass today? Okay, keep going
[13488.82s -> 13495.66s]  It's so blurry and like zoomed in. What do you say gamers? Just wait it just give me a minute
[13495.78s -> 13503.50s]  All right, this is the final one. We're ending on this one. This is it. Whatever it is in the description
[13503.58s -> 13506.36s]  It's a horror game. Oh my fucking early
[13506.36s -> 13510.10s]  It's one of the scariest damn games ever made now
[13510.10s -> 13515.10s]  I don't do well with these types of games and as you can see I'm down the first flight of stairs and I already don't
[13515.10s -> 13521.26s]  Want to play is that is that I don't do is that kind of easy cheese in there in case something crazy
[13521.26s -> 13528.58s]  Yeah, what's that cheese? So let's get started and to try not to psych myself out while I do this
[13528.78s -> 13531.28s]  I'm gonna give you the
[13531.36s -> 13536.32s]  Backstory of the game so pretty much this game
[13539.10s -> 13544.88s]  What's this room? This is my old room. So pretty much from like 12 years ago two days
[13546.18s -> 13552.12s]  19-year-old German. No, not that young. He said he did it on coffee breaks and it's a stairways
[13558.10s -> 13560.10s]  Somebody's coming behind me right now
[13560.54s -> 13563.03s]  Yeah, who cares?
[13563.99s -> 13571.70s]  Really all you do. God. God. Damn it. Who fucking makes their bed? Nobody
[13575.76s -> 13578.56s]  This is literally acting and I'm faking this whole thing. Aren't I look at me?
[13580.01s -> 13583.17s]  Dude, this this this could last like less than three minutes
[13583.17s -> 13594.54s]  Like I this could end I might just rage to quit look at how I do look so young though
[13594.54s -> 13603.00s]  I was probably 25 maybe 25 26 Jesus damn it
[13603.00s -> 13608.19s]  I hate this but you go down a series of stairs
[13608.87s -> 13612.52s]  Over and over are you so caked because I was in the gym every day
[13612.52s -> 13618.63s]  That's the game and the goal is to see how far you can go down how many stairs you can go down
[13618.63s -> 13622.56s]  I'm at floor number six and I'm almost ready to just quit this game
[13622.72s -> 13631.24s]  And it looks insane to that. I think I keep on repeating myself probably but that's because I am terrified right now
[13631.24s -> 13634.68s]  You look like you sniffed radioactive material
[13637.84s -> 13643.09s]  It's called I don't I didn't white balance my cameras and the screen is like green
[13650.32s -> 13652.32s]  Extend all right fine
[13659.91s -> 13664.17s]  Yeah, which sucks I I it's okay here's thing it's a lot different streaming a horror game
[13664.83s -> 13669.03s]  Then recording a video for a horror game because like I don't feel alone when I stream it
[13669.03s -> 13671.03s]  But I am alone when I record it
[13671.03s -> 13685.58s]  That's the worst part about this stuff is getting just loud horrible. It's a little it's different. It is see it's so much repetition
[13685.58s -> 13688.90s]  That it's you just you're doing the same thing over and over again
[13688.90s -> 13691.86s]  And you know at some point look like you're wearing eyeshadow
[13691.86s -> 13704.42s]  I think I just have that I'm just young something horrible is gonna happen. You just don't know when so I
[13705.04s -> 13709.32s]  I'm gonna my if you hit escape you end the game hitting escape ends it
[13709.88s -> 13718.10s]  Yeah, I know that everybody the meme was like you have a toilet paper roll and like lotion behind you and like a can easy cheese
[13718.10s -> 13720.22s]  I don't know whatever whatever the fuck that is
[13720.22s -> 13725.59s]  I don't know if it's in this video or not is that toilet paper back there next to the bed
[13743.91s -> 13749.97s]  Floor 20 floor 20 I've lost that accent in the last 10 to 15 years. Holy shit
[13762.24s -> 13764.24s]  This is not even that long
[13765.48s -> 13777.30s]  Bastard you son of a bitch you have a Vegas accent now. There is no Vegas accent
[13777.30s -> 13782.70s]  I don't think I'll be able to I think I'll be able to go past 30. We want 10 more
[13788.60s -> 13793.47s]  There's no more timer we're just gonna go timer was fun
[13793.47s -> 13800.20s]  It's the first and given a hundred community subs from the bingo no more bingo. We'll just play some we'll do we'll do it
[13800.20s -> 13805.51s]  Like five ten more times. Let's kill that timer
[13806.40s -> 13808.76s]  The shadows are really starting to mess with you now
[13808.76s -> 13811.40s]  Like the shadows are really starting to kick in and really stuff
[13811.40s -> 13814.44s]  It just shows you just how much horror games have evolved in the last 10 years
[13815.00s -> 13817.68s]  people were freaking out over a
[13817.88s -> 13819.88s]  little mask on a staircase in

[13914.74s -> 13921.03s]  Hold on. What's it? Do I move to see the other side? Let me see the other side
[13923.07s -> 13925.07s]  This is like cigarette juice
[13925.19s -> 13934.07s]  Was like dipping and like spitting tobacco into this thing. What is that? There's a dog food on the ground
[13934.07s -> 13937.97s]  What was it? Hold on. What is this like rat shit down here?

[13994.03s -> 14000.90s]  I have no idea what it's doing in the room. But listen, this is dog vitamins
[14001.18s -> 14011.14s]  This is big a big pump of omega-3 for dogs. I don't know if I was eating this
[14011.14s -> 14016.70s]  I don't think I don't think I was eating this but I mean it's possible. I might have been I don't think I was eating that
[14016.70s -> 14021.06s]  But like it's it's a huge pump for it's not lotion
[14021.54s -> 14034.96s]  It's literally fucking dog vitamins. I don't know why it's so big is exposed
[14035.08s -> 14037.88s]  It says it was omega-3 dog pump vitamins
[14038.04s -> 14042.64s]  I have no idea what that is and I don't even know what the hat was either. It's like a gas station hat
[14042.64s -> 14050.46s]  I don't know what that even is. I can't even make out what the fuck this is on my head. Is this like a
[14051.54s -> 14053.97s]  Valphaline, what is this?
[14059.12s -> 14068.46s]  Okay, this is like a jiffy lube hat. I don't even know what that is
[14071.93s -> 14084.04s]  Hey, we're gonna do another one. Let's just go again. Oh nice dusk. I was there's a Jax moment
[14084.04s -> 14096.81s]  We can add it. Why did you have dog? But I don't know
[14097.53s -> 14100.89s]  Stuff just kind of accumulates in random places
[14101.53s -> 14111.04s]  Yeah, and the tissues and the dog vitamin lotion was in a really weird place
[14111.04s -> 14115.68s]  I understand but I'm not it wasn't just sitting there. I oh
[14121.44s -> 14134.81s]  My goodness, I don't think I was eating it had to be a reason why it was there right next to the bed though
[14134.81s -> 14136.81s]  What is it doing there?
[14136.93s -> 14141.27s]  Keep a timer on so you don't stay for too long. I
[14142.11s -> 14148.40s]  Can keep an eye on it was lotion. It was not what lotion company?
[14148.40s -> 14150.40s]  Do you know that makes a weird?
[14150.44s -> 14153.68s]  gigantic like coffee syrup pump like that
[14154.00s -> 14161.12s]  That's that big with a long neck. They don't make it like that with the yellow front
[14161.80s -> 14165.56s]  No, they don't have like the big long fucking turkey neck
[14167.44s -> 14171.02s]  It wasn't lotion was dog vitamins. It was a dog vitamin omega-3 pump
[14175.94s -> 14180.72s]  Something else it's kind of funny to note and I will give you a little bit more
[14181.16s -> 14184.82s]  Like ammo to fire at me the tissue box was empty
[14185.76s -> 14190.92s]  Wow must have been really fucking it must have been really going for it. There's nothing left in there
[14198.84s -> 14207.56s]  God I was just me playing dusk. Whatever. I'm good at this game. Oh, this is a classic. I love this one
[14219.80s -> 14232.02s]  Has this game seen any updates? I feel like this game is really fun. Where's the other wrestler? Oh, they were invisible
[14232.70s -> 14234.70s]  Right. I forgot they're invisible
[14238.40s -> 14242.04s]  You can make the characters invisible
[14242.56s -> 14253.25s]  Wrestling Empire got an update. Yeah, that game was the funniest thing I've ever seen
[14253.85s -> 14257.36s]  All right, let's go again skip
[14257.96s -> 14261.12s]  Little set of clips here, especially in this first one
[14261.24s -> 14263.24s]  circulation nine people in a row and
[14263.44s -> 14266.68s]  Really after playing with this for maybe an hour or two
[14266.68s -> 14268.68s]  I think it took me maybe an hour to get this gameplay
[14268.76s -> 14272.02s]  So after playing with this for a little while I've come to the realization
[14272.18s -> 14279.26s]  What is it I want to do this with the connivorous kunai get a backstab on somebody and just go for the headshots
[14279.42s -> 14281.96s]  All right, fuck off. Yes
[14282.60s -> 14285.67s]  This guy's shit face. He'll be easy. I
[14288.82s -> 14297.54s]  Love it classic. I want to just please have need to make I want more of these I would pay a hundred dollars
[14298.38s -> 14303.86s]  Retail for one of these another one. I would pay a thousand dollars. No, that's way too much
[14303.86s -> 14305.86s]  I'd pay I'd pay a hundred bucks in one of these
[14307.95s -> 14310.77s]  Did he just not even shoot the gun?
[14314.05s -> 14317.70s]  Time for diet and your time has come
[14322.33s -> 14326.65s]  I knew it was in the book. I knew it was in the fucking book and now I lost and it's over
[14332.76s -> 14342.47s]  Yeah, I want to okay, I want to like see some other streamers play these games
[14342.47s -> 14350.00s]  You know, I mean quality acting job lady. Which one is it? I like member when we talked about sharing things
[14350.54s -> 14354.06s]  Yeah, I would love to see other people play this cartoon bag
[14354.06s -> 14359.10s]  I want to watch like streamers play this that's seriously she ran out of there with like a mcduck bag
[14359.22s -> 14363.42s]  You're not gonna fool me. What about this guy Vinny played? Oh Vinny is a connoisseur
[14365.22s -> 14368.94s]  Shit, it doesn't surprise me. He's 500 fucking IQ brain. That does not surprise me
[14374.94s -> 14377.50s]  Thank you shot the ground
[14378.50s -> 14381.94s]  Did they shoot the ground this was directly into the dirt?
[14383.06s -> 14388.30s]  Why is that guy a quick draw fast McGraw? No, we need to gate. He's no get out. We shut up
[14389.02s -> 14391.02s]  No gatekeeping video games
[14391.18s -> 14393.18s]  I have no idea what this guy just said
[14393.74s -> 14396.36s]  Hold on. Wait, that's one of my favorite lines
[14397.12s -> 14401.86s]  So your mama let you come out and play today. Why is that guy a quick draw fast McGraw?
[14402.44s -> 14404.44s]  That doesn't make any sense
[14407.55s -> 14409.55s]  I have no idea what this guy just said
[14410.11s -> 14414.35s]  Target time. Yeah, this could be imagine trying to get the fastest record in the world here
[14421.38s -> 14423.38s]  Oh, there's a mattress right
[14424.38s -> 14427.58s]  You see that mattress behind her that's like a stunt mattress I
[14430.18s -> 14434.80s]  Love it. I'm glad you fell on that stunt mattress inside of a saloon
[14436.96s -> 14447.68s]  Are you sure it out of his hand? I forgot about that one. That was a channel meme five six seven years ago for a long time
[14448.18s -> 14455.25s]  You can't tell oh, yes, the gun and then shoot
[14457.95s -> 14468.64s]  Come on now wasn't that a sub sound for a while that it was wasn't it? Yeah, it was
[14470.97s -> 14472.81s]  moving on
[14472.81s -> 14477.85s]  Get up and walk around after a 50 plus foot jump right there when he fought me
[14477.85s -> 14482.95s]  You're in from behind. They're not even coming out in the right order. This is supposed to be a gauntlet match
[14482.95s -> 14487.41s]  They're not even coming out in the right order. It's supposed to be one after the other. What are they doing? What triggered this?
[14487.41s -> 14490.81s]  I seriously don't it was such a pain in the ass to edit
[14491.33s -> 14494.97s]  Santa Claus has been under that ring for probably like three hours, by the way
[14494.97s -> 14500.81s]  Meanwhile grandpa not paying any attention to who's behind him. That's bad boy with a clothesline
[14501.37s -> 14505.01s]  He's supposed to be dead bad boy is supposed to be dead right now
[14505.01s -> 14509.17s]  But for some reason he just snuck up behind him is even supposed to be in this he's not
[14510.13s -> 14513.19s]  Everybody that is supposed to be a combatant in this gauntlet
[14513.19s -> 14517.75s]  It's over on the left side this is back when and bad boy is in the ring does yeah
[14519.65s -> 14522.61s]  So back the after like 2013
[14523.25s -> 14528.46s]  It wasn't just a rumble. It was like oh, I want to do a bunch of matches and have a big storyline and
[14530.38s -> 14534.38s]  The thing about the old wrestling like WWE 2k14 2k13
[14535.06s -> 14540.66s]  You know the the good ones were before they've ruined everything and the game was a piece of absolute steaming fucking garbage
[14541.69s -> 14546.81s]  So before that you could there was like these little like clip mode
[14547.03s -> 14556.62s]  Well, you could put wrestlers in and make a little scene and you could create and craft these weird rants
[14556.62s -> 14558.62s]  It was it was like the movies
[14558.62s -> 14560.06s]  Where it's like here's a scenario
[14560.06s -> 14565.74s]  Who do you want to be as it's like two like mannequins are standing in and you can just make up your own little storylines
[14565.74s -> 14567.74s]  they were like dozens and dozens of clips and
[14569.70s -> 14575.76s]  Then they made it a sports simulation Madden game that we just update the roster and the game breaks half the time
[14577.35s -> 14579.35s]  It was so good
[14584.32s -> 14588.08s]  It was awesome that half of the clips that you see in these all germa rumble videos
[14589.08s -> 14591.08s]  Were sort of string together
[14591.88s -> 14599.20s]  In that weird sort of puzzle of putting a little scene together and I would cut it and I would put it into the actual match
[14601.62s -> 14606.53s]  See like but they were just wrestling but you are this was
[14611.29s -> 14614.81s]  This was not just part of the match like I had to go in and piece this together
[14614.81s -> 14618.81s]  It was so much fun to do
[14622.49s -> 14624.49s]  And then they got rid of it
[14625.93s -> 14631.20s]  The new one coming out I am gonna hold my breath completely
[14648.49s -> 14650.86s]  Oh, yeah, that's what I was huge
[14650.94s -> 14656.15s]  This is still going on. This is still going on backstage. They're still beating the shit
[14658.15s -> 14659.68s]  I
[14659.68s -> 14666.02s]  I'm gonna hold my breath on any new wrestling game that comes out cuz I feel like they've lost their way completely across every single
[14666.26s -> 14672.24s]  Piece of media from the shit that's on TV from the shit that you play in in your home on your console
[14672.32s -> 14674.32s]  They've lost their way 100%
[14674.76s -> 14678.68s]  Some of these new organizations are starting to try to be a little bit more fun and interesting
[14679.04s -> 14686.35s]  But no, no, it's it's I'm gonna hold my breath you go back to the way that like kind of they used to do
[14686.35s -> 14688.35s]  This shit back in like 2013 2012
[14689.28s -> 14692.42s]  2014 I know that the company that used to work on these games
[14693.04s -> 14697.86s]  Split off right was it a AKI? Whatever was what's the name of the company?
[14697.90s -> 14704.14s]  they said we keep making the same fucking game over and over again and
[14705.91s -> 14713.23s]  It's youks. Yeah, you okay. I was the other company that worked on it, right? They made like a statement saying hey
[14713.27s -> 14718.47s]  We're gonna make our own wrestling game we think because we just keep doing the same shit with these WWE games
[14718.47s -> 14721.94s]  I have such high hopes, but I don't want to have like it
[14721.94s -> 14731.07s]  I'm holding my breath again that they're gonna bring this kind of crazy shit back and yet THQ everybody gave shit to THQ
[14731.07s -> 14735.58s]  But man, wasn't that kind of like a turning point when THQ went away?
[14735.58s -> 14743.02s]  I feel like we lost a lot of kind of really wacky creative fun shit that that that studio was doing
[14743.02s -> 14749.70s]  The people give a lot of shit to THQ. Ah, the games are fucking terrible. They're like sevens out of ten six out of ten
[14749.70s -> 14756.62s]  They're like kind of shitty and dumb. I look back at the catalogue the THQ had it was pretty phenomenal
[14756.62s -> 14765.25s]  And I even remember being one of these people that's like, oh THQ when I business whatever who cares
[14765.25s -> 14767.32s]  I guess they were they were okay
[14767.32s -> 14773.01s]  What if you actually go back to see the influence that they had on the industry and all the stuff that stuff that they were
[14773.01s -> 14781.54s]  Making holy fuck they had a lot to do with a why shit was even people were even to have been making fun games in
[14781.54s -> 14795.30s]  The first place it was one of the last remaining double-a studios. Yeah, I wish they would make a revival
[14795.34s -> 14803.48s]  I wish like somebody would buy them and just let them kind of go again. It was kind of like a weird THQ Nordic is
[14804.20s -> 14811.87s]  Making a comeback. Yeah, I hope so. It's the new revival. What are they making? What are they working on?
[14811.87s -> 14828.06s]  They're doing time splitters three destroy all humans. Yeah, I hope so because they would just really creative funny things and fun stuff
[14828.98s -> 14836.84s]  Look, we've kind of gotten into this mode in video games now where I think a lot of these companies are taking themselves way too seriously
[14837.16s -> 14844.43s]  Like everything's being taken way too seriously. It's got to be like this. It has to be like this. It's got to get done
[14844.47s -> 14850.93s]  It's got to be like I I kind of miss like when devs kind of just fucked around and made fun shit for because they
[14850.93s -> 14861.34s]  Wanted to the indie scene is still doing that right? But it's almost like this just to it's like indie games and just triple-a games
[14861.34s -> 14872.62s]  Right. It's like we lost that double-a kind of mentality. Hope it comes back. Anyways, let's press the button again
[14872.62s -> 14886.34s]  How can you say the double-a studios don't exist when game Freak still makes Pokemon?
[14886.34s -> 14891.21s]  I have it Pokemon is like a mmm a monster property owned by Nintendo
[14891.49s -> 14897.30s]  I I mean, I can't speak to oh that was an insult. Oh, okay. That was an insult
[14899.48s -> 14905.22s]  That was insulting. I get it. Okay, we're gonna click the button
[14917.70s -> 14920.25s]  Here if you think that that's like stupid
[14921.60s -> 14926.20s]  That's like a book and one of the most catchiest songs I've ever heard in my life. What is so I'm sorry
[14926.92s -> 14930.18s]  What song I need to know
[14939.05s -> 14954.73s]  What's the song I don't care enough to tell you that aren't you curious on Super Mario RPG legend of the seven stars Oh
[14955.17s -> 14967.30s]  Based of course my kind of music based absolutely 100% based. We have to actually feed the fire
[14967.54s -> 14976.26s]  All right open. Okay, the oven needs to reach the optimal temperature
[14976.78s -> 14983.02s]  I'm glad we did this again the thermometer on the left side of the oven as time progresses
[14983.02s -> 14986.50s]  The oven will slowly run out of fuel make sure to add logs from time to time keep fire
[14986.50s -> 14994.98s]  I'll just a Pete the pizza one right get in there to do it again. All right, get it in the green
[14995.84s -> 15003.98s]  Yeah, I want enough time to pass where we don't overdo it though a wood-fired pizza. Yeah, that's the best again
[15004.18s -> 15007.51s]  You will come with shibby
[15007.95s -> 15009.95s]  2142
[15010.47s -> 15015.85s]  Yeah, it's kind of rolling through by the way, let me just tell you this right now. I remember this video
[15015.85s -> 15021.45s]  Let's go take that last point. I remember this specifically and you know why I remember this specifically because this was like a holy shit
[15021.45s -> 15029.57s]  This is a big deal shibby. This is back when I had like 500 subs on YouTube actually 2010 2011
[15029.57s -> 15037.78s]  Whatever it was shibby was killing it shibby has like 30,000 subs 50,000 subs and he like reached out
[15037.78s -> 15039.60s]  He was like, hey, man, we should do a video sometime
[15039.60s -> 15044.70s]  I looked at his channel and I was like like holy shit this guy this guy this is a god
[15044.98s -> 15048.46s]  You've got 50 fucking thousand subs on YouTube. Are you kidding me?
[15049.34s -> 15057.35s]  Yeah, oh sure. Let's we'll make video should be then went on to work at machinima
[15057.35s -> 15060.69s]  And then he started working at other companies and he's like in the industry now
[15060.69s -> 15069.70s]  Do you like if I think like talent management shit? I should be should be a good dude
[15069.70s -> 15072.50s]  I I've talked to him recently
[15072.50s -> 15080.55s]  I was he was always like really supportive of like the channel even when he moved on to kind of do the stuff like in
[15080.55s -> 15084.01s]  The industry we would talk we would hang out
[15084.25s -> 15088.77s]  Yeah, I've this is that I was like really excited to do this because I was like, holy shit
[15089.57s -> 15093.75s]  YouTuber, oh, we just want to sit in the rain all day. Oh
[15095.78s -> 15097.30s]  stereotyping a city
[15097.30s -> 15102.61s]  Damn, and by the way, I'm nervous in this video. I'm like, holy fuck. I better be funny and good
[15102.61s -> 15104.89s]  I have to like be good like I'm gonna be medic and just like heal him
[15104.89s -> 15110.25s]  I'm gonna heal the fuck out of him as medic. No one likes me. I'm gonna switch demo. We got three medics right now
[15111.25s -> 15117.46s]  It's down. It's down. Oh, maybe if I do good and I'm like I heal him and we like have a good conversation
[15119.54s -> 15122.38s]  Look at how much fun he sounds like he's having this is awesome. Yes, he's having fun
[15125.11s -> 15133.10s]  75 FOV yikes. That's right. This is 70 FOV default weapon Andy
[15133.10s -> 15136.34s]  This is before they did an update with a demo man got new items guys
[15136.58s -> 15140.29s]  The demo man didn't have new stuff to play with this is just the game
[15149.22s -> 15153.43s]  Not true, I think I don't remember the demo man had a new item stop he's trying to move it up here
[15153.91s -> 15155.91s]  If they was it was only like one or two
[15156.99s -> 15158.99s]  Have the oh
[15159.55s -> 15161.55s]  Probably was only like three items battle. Oh
[15164.58s -> 15166.58s]  Teleporter and centuries down. Oh
[15166.78s -> 15171.82s]  What's the point of me getting?
[15171.82s -> 15177.96s]  D I remember this this game is awful inventory sticky spamming in a pub
[15178.52s -> 15180.60s]  That that just scared the shit out of me
[15181.46s -> 15186.54s]  Did you left the menu sound scared the fuck out of me? This is look I can't even see what's going on
[15186.54s -> 15197.62s]  I look like I feel like I'm shit-faced watching an old CRT TV with one eye open a button a minute
[15197.86s -> 15201.74s]  Gliding down
[15204.38s -> 15206.06s]  This is the last one whatever it is
[15206.06s -> 15208.14s]  We're going out on it play it really at all
[15208.14s -> 15211.01s]  But kind of a little bit because we're gonna talk about something today
[15211.25s -> 15215.29s]  That I noticed and it's when you notice these things that you start to go
[15215.29s -> 15219.69s]  Why the hell am I doing that and it freaks you out because you start thinking about it every time you do it
[15219.69s -> 15222.05s]  What I'm talking about what is it weird?
[15222.73s -> 15229.21s]  Obsessive compulsive habits that we have when we play video games. Oh, no, it doesn't have to be just team fortress, too
[15229.21s -> 15235.45s]  It doesn't have to be just an MMO or an action game. This is across the board. It's just a different quirk
[15235.45s -> 15240.03s]  It's just a different compulsive thing gone for anything. Yeah, I know. Ooh
[15240.79s -> 15247.95s]  This game was a this is awesome. I loved this game
[15250.53s -> 15257.49s]  No, I did it again the rock is back in Ohio I keep doing that I keep telling you exactly where I'm standing
[15257.49s -> 15263.80s]  It was just one hit kill only rail gun. It was so much fun me. Okay, good
[15265.36s -> 15267.60s]  Give
[15270.34s -> 15272.22s]  Bring this back
[15272.22s -> 15276.10s]  Bring this game back. Don't you believe it? I've got a hacker on the server
[15276.10s -> 15281.75s]  I mean, it's I mean this game was fucking unbelievable. I bring this back
[15281.75s -> 15284.87s]  I'm just gonna like focus up here new new twitch meta
[15284.87s -> 15288.90s]  You think I think it has an opportunity to be one hit the fucking pole
[15288.90s -> 15294.42s]  I hit the pole this really could be one of these kind of new meta twitch metas telling me
[15295.58s -> 15297.89s]  All right, hold on to this thought
[15299.17s -> 15303.93s]  As in the tournament type shit you do lead tournaments with this would be insane
[15308.26s -> 15311.38s]  I work on it my perspective. It looked like I hit you
[15312.90s -> 15315.62s]  You could do a kind of like a bunny hop rocket jump
[15318.17s -> 15323.11s]  Yeah, you're gonna pull that on me you're gonna pull a me on you you're gonna pull me on you
[15323.11s -> 15325.11s]  Gonna hit up Ludwig
[15327.61s -> 15334.97s]  Ludwig I've got another harebrained idea for you. It's called rats is to give get 40 people to fucking show up
[15343.25s -> 15348.06s]  All right last one whatever it is is it classic we're leaving on this
[15357.74s -> 15360.78s]  I know I realize it's Adam Sandler
[15383.74s -> 15385.74s]  And you use the site yeah
[15388.12s -> 15390.23s]  Nearly there
[15391.19s -> 15392.63s]  Now one more
[15392.63s -> 15397.81s]  No, this isn't a bad game. This is weird. I was just making a reference to the fact that all the recent Tony Hawk games
[15397.81s -> 15399.53s]  I've been fucking awful
[15399.53s -> 15401.09s]  What is this?
[15401.09s -> 15405.97s]  this game just is a thousand times more difficult than Tony skate 3 I
[15407.58s -> 15409.22s]  Didn't play this
[15409.22s -> 15416.26s]  Let's go back to the marker. I don't this is this is not even my video. I think this is wrong ramp
[15416.26s -> 15421.71s]  I don't I think the the ramp. All right, it's somebody else's stream. I think I don't think I have enough speed here
[15422.43s -> 15427.98s]  Let's do a pump. Yeah, this is not even my didn't stream this
[15435.75s -> 15439.71s]  This is what okay for all the new viewers this was considered one of the worst streams I've ever done
[15444.10s -> 15445.46s]  Okay, I
[15445.46s -> 15451.42s]  Spent how long is this two hours and 32 minutes and it's just me being bad and talking about how the game sucks and
[15453.17s -> 15458.53s]  Skate 3 is considered one of the greatest skate simulators ever made and I was so salty
[15458.89s -> 15461.21s]  The controls sucked and the game was fucking awful and shit
[15461.33s -> 15467.78s]  Yeah, this is this is one of the worst streams I've ever done putting myself in a really stupid awkward position
[15467.78s -> 15470.42s]  Let's find it only because I wouldn't want demon days to
[15471.14s -> 15481.50s]  Let's find it. I'll own it press a press F and then fucking things to do
[15482.08s -> 15488.45s]  Even days is a good album. Why can I just never have any responsibilities and just play skate and learn how to play it and do good
[15489.21s -> 15491.21s]  He beat me up
[15493.30s -> 15496.12s]  Well
[15496.92s -> 15504.36s]  Jesus but yeah make that shit when do I am I like misremembering this don't I talk about how I hate this whole thing
[15504.36s -> 15509.22s]  And this game is a tutorial
[15509.58s -> 15515.47s]  All right, you gotta stop doing that man
[15516.23s -> 15518.41s]  Speed here. I don't
[15518.69s -> 15521.99s]  What?
[15521.99s -> 15531.46s]  All right, last one one more. How do you manual you're a concern with this item? No. Oh

[15757.42s -> 15763.30s]  That's incredible or by the way Mario you have to do all the dirty that's I'm getting this trip down memory that's incredible or
[15767.17s -> 15769.17s]  Incredible orb was such a fucking awesome, dude
[15769.17s -> 15776.82s]  Because he can jump higher than Michael Jordan, I remember he wanted some funny here his listen to this he still streams, too
[15776.82s -> 15784.03s]  I gotta fucking like rate him. He's just he's from Sweden. So we just never stream at the same time
[15785.03s -> 15789.39s]  So here's thing about incredible orb. There's some tips a little nut tip, but here's some insight for you
[15789.79s -> 15797.47s]  Incredible orb is the only person is one of two people that I have met through like YouTube and like content creation
[15797.47s -> 15809.86s]  That's ever met my parents nice machinima shirt. Yeah, I literally have nothing but like swell things to say about incredible orb
[15809.90s -> 15825.84s]  I just like was just a class act and I'm sure still is take it home. Remember. This is cute
[15829.21s -> 15836.31s]  He just ran a bunch of marathons. Yeah
[15836.87s -> 15839.74s]  He see he kept doing the healthy shit
[15839.74s -> 15846.32s]  I remember us having conversations about all lifting and being healthy and like working out and I turned into like fucking like an
[15846.76s -> 15856.77s]  Insect person I turned to like a bug. I turned to like a big fat like beetle person and he's out here running marathons
[15856.97s -> 15862.46s]  No, good. That's good
[15865.66s -> 15867.66s]  The sway the sway
[15883.62s -> 15886.70s]  I put a in my channel trailer for YouTube ten years ago
[15888.83s -> 15895.99s]  Strafing that's just strafing case. You didn't know
[15896.55s -> 15902.22s]  Well you non gamers they don't know that pressing A and D makes you
[15902.58s -> 15906.06s]  Step left and right without needing to move your mouse
[15906.06s -> 15912.01s]  That was so important that I make sure everybody knows that I thought I was such a brilliant
[15912.89s -> 15922.67s]  Smart motherfucker. I thought I was so goddamn gifted that was in the the four minutes of real estate of
[15923.07s -> 15929.39s]  Small amount of real estate that I had to show you to make sure you knew I was a gamer and it worked
[15929.39s -> 15933.38s]  I was good
[15933.38s -> 15934.38s]  also
[15934.38s -> 15938.18s]  Put smite in the channel trailer cuz I thought I was gonna play it every day and it was gonna be my new game
[15956.09s -> 15959.81s]  I think this burger boy in this and I think he's Matt. Yeah, he misses the table
[15959.81s -> 15964.15s]  Best players in the world and I'll show you right here. Look at this. Get the fuck out of here
[15966.70s -> 15974.10s]  Grandpa there is the whole time turn it up turn it up. Yeah burger boys in this video
[15977.29s -> 15981.89s]  All right, let's go tell yourself it's possible and you have to act on those possibilities
[15988.86s -> 15993.58s]  Okay, so they did on the burger boy there's a video of my channel burger boy in a Twinkie eating contest and
[15994.50s -> 15996.50s]  He there was a little
[15996.98s -> 16006.06s]  Okay, there's some context so burger boy and exoskeleton bug Millennium boy two different people by the way
[16006.48s -> 16009.72s]  they did a Twinkie contest for 15,000 subs on the channel and
[16011.12s -> 16014.34s]  Burger boy one is a disgusting video. I don't even know why it's still uploaded
[16015.08s -> 16019.08s]  so after the videos over I it's a burger boys the champion and
[16020.66s -> 16026.50s]  There's like maybe like four or five Twinkies that are left that he didn't eat and he went to swing his hand down to smash
[16026.50s -> 16035.32s]  Them and it's like a hard just like granite countertop. He misses the Twinkies and smash you see smashes his fucking hand
[16036.12s -> 16047.86s]  smashes it and like destroys it listen to this that was a hard granite countertop and I think after that he's like
[16047.86s -> 16065.86s]  Oh, and the other person's like, I'm sorry. I missed it. I didn't I'm sorry. I missed it. Oh, yeah, I threw a cake in his face

[16256.86s -> 16259.80s]  It's it's a weird feeling. It's kind of odd
