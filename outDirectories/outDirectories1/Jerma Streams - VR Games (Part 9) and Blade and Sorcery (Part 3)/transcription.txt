[1.21s -> 9.19s]  You're my iPad, Mayo, and Wine THG tensed stream featuring Krabby Patty and Fortnite Mobile.
[9.19s -> 18.49s]  That's me. I'm that guy. I'm your guy. Somebody wrote that. I didn't just say that.
[18.49s -> 23.94s]  No one said that. Yeah, like 30 people did. Hey, destroy dude. Thanks for the five. Give me 30 subs.
[23.94s -> 31.98s]  Right off the bat here. Welcome back, everybody. We're going to continue our trek through VR.
[31.98s -> 40.46s]  We are not going to play Half-Life Alex today. That is reserved for tomorrow and Tuesday.
[40.46s -> 46.74s]  I'm hoping to get through Half-Life Alex either tomorrow or Tuesday. I've heard it's about a 10
[46.74s -> 55.90s]  to 15 hour long experience thinking maybe three streams will do it. Maybe. One of the scary games.
[57.61s -> 64.10s]  I have like at least five scary VR games downloaded. We'll get to them. Wait till...
[64.10s -> 71.96s]  It's not Halloween yet. Wait till at least like the week of Halloween. I don't do like October
[71.96s -> 77.43s]  every day is a scary day. When is Chubby Bunny? That's going to happen next week.
[79.91s -> 86.20s]  Fucking Chubby Bunny. Patience is a virtue. Yeah. Hey, the Fooly. Thanks for the five.
[86.20s -> 92.76s]  Give me 30 subs. He's a liar, liar, liar. I'm not a liar. Look, you... I'm not... And by the way,
[93.88s -> 100.60s]  people think I'm going to die if I do Chubby Bunny. I'm not going to do Chubby Bunny until I die.
[100.60s -> 106.41s]  I don't know why you think that's going to happen. I'm going to do like seven marshmallows and then
[106.41s -> 118.42s]  we're going to call it a day. I'm not going to die. Chubby Bunny is going to put him in a wheelchair.
[118.42s -> 128.18s]  That's not going to happen, dude. But for now, we have a few games I want to go through.
[130.44s -> 141.18s]  Very importantly, the main thing today is The Room VR. I made a video like seven years ago
[141.74s -> 147.94s]  about The Room. It's one of my favorite series. And I'm not even kidding. It's an iPad series.
[148.50s -> 154.04s]  Hold on. Don't be such a dick yet. It's on Steam. They ported it to Steam like three or four years
[154.04s -> 162.50s]  ago. It's this like box inside of a box inside of a box puzzle game. It's so much fun. They made a
[162.50s -> 168.92s]  VR version of it. And it's not just a VR version of the first game. Or, oh yeah, we like slapped
[168.92s -> 175.32s]  some goggles on you and we gave you hands. No, it's a completely from the ground up VR game
[175.40s -> 181.56s]  experience. So fuck yeah, that's what we're doing today. But before that,
[181.56s -> 186.86s]  I think that's at least a couple hours. We're going to do some just VR fucking bacon wrapped cheese,
[187.42s -> 192.76s]  bacon wrapped scallops. Fucking Resident Sleevers. It's been four minutes, dude.
[196.73s -> 204.74s]  You can't show up to the concert. And they're like just before the concert music is playing.
[205.38s -> 214.42s]  All right, what's the lineup today? Oh, we got Blink-182. We got Kanye. And the main event
[214.42s -> 222.07s]  is Skrillex. And it's like, oh nice. Okay, I can't wait. I'm at the concert now.
[223.05s -> 229.85s]  Oh, this is boring. Turn off this like before the concert music. Where's Skrillex? That's what I'm
[229.85s -> 233.69s]  here for. I don't want to sit here for four hours and wait for Skrillex. Get them on now.
[238.38s -> 243.10s]  That's true. You don't resident sleeper at a concert. If you resident sleeper at a concert,
[243.10s -> 251.56s]  you may have the wrong choice of music. Start the stream. I need my crack.
[254.70s -> 263.14s]  This guy sucks. This music sucks. Song sucks. Honey, how much were these seats?
[264.66s -> 274.55s]  They were $180 a piece. Oh, you like this music? No, you do. I'm just humoring you by coming to a
[274.55s -> 280.57s]  concert that you wanted to go to. But don't you think this guy sucks? Yeah, actually I do.
[280.57s -> 287.29s]  But you're the one that listens to it in the car every day. Yeah, but I mean, I mean, this concert
[287.29s -> 299.45s]  sucks. All right, let's go. That's wrong. This is a true story. He's projecting. He didn't think
[299.45s -> 306.06s]  you're going to see me show up right now, did you? Oh shit, hold on. And I got the VR guys on camera
[306.06s -> 313.62s]  shirt and I got one of these. We ain't fucking around today, boys and girls. I ain't fucking
[313.62s -> 327.24s]  around today. I am protecting my hair today. He's got a dirty shirt. You know, okay, you guys know
[327.24s -> 336.98s]  that time has passed since the last stream, right? This is not like 12 hours after the last stream,
[336.98s -> 346.26s]  just because the last stream happened. I've washed this by hand. How do they even take this off?
[346.26s -> 350.63s]  And dude, you know something weird about headbands? I feel like that blood is being
[350.63s -> 357.08s]  constricted to my brain. I hate these. I feel like it takes longer for me to say sentences right now.
[357.08s -> 369.90s]  Is that weird? It kind of feels weird. All right, let's go. First up is Taphouse VR. This is just a
[369.90s -> 374.55s]  meme game we're going to play for like a half an hour. Why am I holding this like I'm videotaping
[374.55s -> 380.63s]  you at like a wedding? Okay, okay, now go in and kiss, go in and kiss each other. Yep, yep, yep,
[381.03s -> 386.47s]  oh my god. Yeah, that looks great. I'll be back about 40 or 50 more times during the course of
[386.47s -> 404.70s]  the wedding to annoy the fuck out of you. Stop harassing the bridesmaids. I'm going in. Can you
[404.70s -> 412.98s]  guys hear this? No, you can't. Isn't that what you did? I was paid to be there. They paid me to be
[412.98s -> 422.90s]  annoying. And look, all right, I know, I know. Look, I gotta address this. Yes, we are getting into like
[422.90s -> 429.21s]  fat germa arc. I know, I know, I know you can see this because I can see it. You know, I know you
[429.21s -> 437.61s]  can. I've gained like fucking 20 pounds since the last time you saw me on camera. I'm strong and I
[437.61s -> 443.69s]  can like rest shit on there now. My iPad, like when I'm lying down, my iPad can just sit right there
[444.25s -> 452.62s]  and I just go like this and I like I just sit there and I like I play Hearthstone, right? I play
[452.62s -> 457.50s]  Hearthstone and then in a little window in the corner is like preparing and playing Hearthstone.
[458.14s -> 466.06s]  It's awesome. I can't even see what the fuck he's doing. I just like having it on. I got the picture
[466.06s -> 488.54s]  in picture. Stonebod. Here comes the bad boy arc. Why would that be a bad boy arc? Wait, are we
[488.54s -> 492.78s]  talking like bad boy? Like I took cookies out of the jar and it was like, get away from there.
[493.26s -> 510.10s]  Or like I ride a motorcycle. Which one? Both. All right, let's go. This is Taphouse VR.
[513.30s -> 522.30s]  Why am I already wicked hot? It shouldn't be like this, dude. Dude, they need like an AC unit in here.
[522.30s -> 532.62s]  You know when like a mascot has a fucking costume on? Valve, get on that. Now the headband's in the
[532.62s -> 536.81s]  fucking way. All right, I'm good. At least it's protecting the hair. I don't want to lose that
[536.81s -> 552.09s]  shit because I will. All right, I'm in a good place. There you are. All right, how do I play?
[552.89s -> 564.97s]  How do you play? Oh, okay. Normal, bold, collected, drink serve, drink accuracy,
[564.97s -> 571.29s]  dead customers. I thought that was somebody coming in my actual room. Dead customers.
[576.95s -> 584.58s]  Wait, there's a slot machine? I don't even know how to play. Are these like triplets?
[589.64s -> 596.42s]  What does he want? He wants gnarly juice, cranberry flavor. Can I punch him in the face? No,
[596.42s -> 602.90s]  don't do that yet. Cranberry juice. Oh, here we go. Okay, that was a monitor. That was a monitor.
[603.54s -> 611.51s]  All right, cranberry juice. You got it. Here you go. How much do you want?
[613.74s -> 626.70s]  You get to take the whole thing. What's that? What's that? Why is he like doing like,
[627.50s -> 637.14s]  do you want a beer? Everyone else notice that every VR game is based around like pouring
[637.14s -> 643.88s]  drinks into glasses and then throwing the glass at the guy's face. All right, you want 50%
[643.88s -> 653.58s]  Spropa bar. Wait, hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Do I have this shit? What's Spropa bar? It's just make
[653.58s -> 659.90s]  a mess. VR. Make a fucking mess. And you don't have to clean it up. That's the big selling point.
[659.90s -> 671.06s]  Okay, Spropa bar energy drink. Okay, we got gnarly juice. Got it. The right one. No, it's the wrong
[671.06s -> 693.32s]  one. Here we go. And then milk. Oh, all right. What do you want? You want one in the curved glass.

[1041.80s -> 1050.71s]  going right back into the restaurant. Oh my god. It's going to go over, isn't it? Okay. Seriously.
[1051.51s -> 1062.25s]  Is it tipping over? Is it falling? I don't know. I'm a diamond. Bring the shelf down. No.

[1305.26s -> 1310.14s]  Oh, what's that? Oh, half of you didn't even come get it because half of you didn't even
[1310.14s -> 1317.02s]  fucking want it in the first place. Two of you wanted this. 12 of you didn't. Okay. That's a lot
[1317.02s -> 1322.22s]  of fun. Being a bartender with a bunch of dickheads. Oh, we all love that, don't we?
[1328.31s -> 1342.74s]  Real world experience. It's... It's zingy. I feel like I'm in an airplane bathroom. Where am I? Why
[1342.74s -> 1355.75s]  am I so... Why am I hitting the same wall so many times? They've got Skrillex. Okay. I'm gonna go
[1355.75s -> 1361.18s]  to the next one. That was kind of fun. That was pretty fun. That was fun. Wasn't it? I thought
[1361.26s -> 1366.94s]  it was pretty cool. Come on for a sec. Oh, this is... Why the fuck did I get over here?
[1371.19s -> 1384.10s]  Skrillex waiting room. I already won the slots. All right. Give me one sec. That was fun. Okay. I
[1384.10s -> 1394.33s]  forget the next game. What was it? Oh, right, right. It was Hell... Hell... Hell Road VR. Right. Now I
[1394.33s -> 1413.03s]  remember. No. Okay. Hold on. Let me get it up. A long drive. It's called Hell Road. You ride a
[1413.03s -> 1422.58s]  motorcycle. It looks intense as hell. I missed some subs here. We had a five from Donut. Thank
[1422.58s -> 1429.59s]  you, Donut. And then $50 from Zurich Da. 5,000 bits to say love you, big man. Thanks a lot, dude.
[1430.15s -> 1437.98s]  That's a shitload of money. That's an extreme amount of money. I'll take it and I will spend it
[1439.86s -> 1455.35s]  the worst possible way. Okay. Let's get this up. And here we go. Should be able to see now.
[1455.99s -> 1468.15s]  There you go. Okay. What does it want me to do? Re-center. Hold on. Re-center your view until the
[1468.15s -> 1473.27s]  windows are in the correct position. Press R to reload. Press enter to finish calibration.
[1476.74s -> 1486.49s]  Holy shit. Dude. I got, you know... I haven't even done it in VR. When you sit on a couch and you
[1486.49s -> 1490.97s]  have a pretend like 5,000 foot screen, that's what this is. I'm at like a movie theater right now.
[1491.61s -> 1499.37s]  This is a seated experience. What? Okay. Press R to reload window positions. I'm gonna press R.
[1505.37s -> 1514.54s]  Does it really matter? Good. Press enter to finish or toggle edit mode with VR controllers.
[1516.84s -> 1522.12s]  Sit. Seat comfortably. Please seat comfortable in the chair and activate both VR controllers.
[1522.84s -> 1527.99s]  Oh, this is good. This is fine. So, but how do I get the... I press enter.
[1530.62s -> 1546.33s]  I'm ready. You ready? I can stand up on the bike. I'll be fine. Both controllers are activated.
[1546.33s -> 1572.86s]  How am I going home? Oh, how do we go home? It crashed? Game crashed? How did it crash?
[1573.66s -> 1586.54s]  How does a game like that crash? Why does it want me to host a Minecraft room?
[1586.54s -> 1589.66s]  Because I wasn't sitting down. Well, what the... All right. I am now.
[1590.38s -> 1610.66s]  Try this again. I'm clearly sitting now. Okay. Okay. That's good. See. Here we go.
[1612.58s -> 1628.52s]  All right. I'm sitting. This is a seated experience. I think it crashed again.
[1630.87s -> 1637.85s]  All right. Well, we're not playing that one, I guess. That was... That one looked fucking really
[1637.85s -> 1643.08s]  cool too. That's unfortunate. Well, we've got a whole shitload, so it doesn't really matter.
[1643.72s -> 1652.28s]  Oh. Oh, fuck yeah. You ready for this shit? Are you ready for me to prove to you guys once
[1652.28s -> 1673.83s]  and for all what I fucking can do? I hope so. Let's go. Oh yeah. Time to show you how to play
[1673.83s -> 1683.88s]  the drums. Everybody thought I was a liar. I'm about to prove to everybody that I can fucking
[1683.88s -> 1692.82s]  play the drums for real. We'll see you. Ah, that crashed too, didn't it? Fuck. How did that crash?
[1693.38s -> 1709.77s]  VR is just... VR was just never ready for us. All right. Here we go. He's got a virus? No, I've
[1709.77s -> 1731.35s]  reinstalled my entire fucking operating system. I don't have a virus. Okay. That's better. What the
[1731.35s -> 1736.63s]  fuck happened to you guys? Why? Okay. Why did fucking a stupid motorcycle game fuck this all up?
[1737.51s -> 1753.40s]  Fucking uninstall that piece of shit. Whatever. I'm only gonna play this for like 10 minutes
[1753.40s -> 1770.70s]  anyways and we're moving on to the next one. Okay. Let's go. All right. I lost chat now.
[1771.42s -> 1783.40s]  Bunch of horse shit. Uh, we're gonna do rocket. Oh, I can't wait for this shit. Don't even tell me
[1783.40s -> 1799.18s]  you crashed. Okay. Can you guys hear this? Where's the audio? What the fuck did that game do to my
[1799.18s -> 1821.22s]  computer? I gotta... Hold on. No, no. Wait, wait, wait. I gotta reboot SteamVR. Fucking pile of shit.
[1828.33s -> 1833.85s]  Virus stream. Yeah, it's called... It took over SteamVR, broke my whole computer, and then deleted
[1833.85s -> 1848.98s]  my audio. How much was that fucking game? Hold on. Give me a second. Let's... Searching. Yeah, yeah,
[1848.98s -> 1861.21s]  yeah, yeah. I know, I know, I know. Reboot this shit. Write a negative review on Steam. No. I didn't
[1861.21s -> 1871.54s]  get a chance to play it. Okay. Here we go. Everybody relax. I'm gonna calm down. Not gonna be upset
[1871.54s -> 1876.90s]  about this. We don't get upset about things that we don't. We have no control over. Right, Jeremy?
[1880.02s -> 1896.68s]  Okay. Very nice. I can... Why can't you guys hear this? What the fuck? Yeah, it says... It's the
[1896.68s -> 1902.98s]  Vive. It should be coming through the Vive right now. There we go. All right. I got it, I got it,

[1921.10s -> 1949.50s]  There we are. Fucking killing me. Okay, can you see me? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[1949.50s -> 1962.17s]  Fuck. Such like a production to do this shit. You gotta have like eight programs open for VR to be
[1962.17s -> 1972.81s]  streamable. No, just have like four windows open and download like six fucking mods. It's easy.
[1972.81s -> 1981.58s]  It's easy. All right. I better be able to see you guys. I'm not gonna be fucking mad as hell.
[1982.22s -> 1988.30s]  Oh, this whole, this whole thing is fucking broken. Now I can't even see the goddamn chat.
[1988.30s -> 1996.20s]  That's fucking, that's phenomenal. Oh, what is this? Would 0.2% of people own this shit?
[1996.84s -> 2026.84s]  Whatever. I have to, I'm gonna play. Why are you not showing up? I'll fix this later. I don't even
[2026.84s -> 2037.37s]  need to see chat right now. All right. There it is. Wait, I don't have a foot. I don't have a foot.
[2037.37s -> 2053.59s]  How do I do that? Oh, this is weird without a foot. This is weird without a foot. This is weird
[2053.59s -> 2066.33s]  without, I can't do, I have to do with my fingers. I can't do it. I can't, I thought I'd be seating.
[2067.05s -> 2081.51s]  You know, do you know how fucking weird it is to have to do the foot pedal with your
[2081.51s -> 2131.37s]  finger? In the fucking rim. What the fuck was that? I wish I had a fucking foot pedal.
[2131.37s -> 2166.41s]  My VR just crashed. Why was I just on a, why was I just on a fucking iceberg? In high school,
[2166.41s -> 2173.29s]  that like is so ready to show the family reunion him play the drums. And he's kind of nervous
[2173.29s -> 2178.41s]  because he's like, I've never played in front of a crowd before. And then the whole family sit there
[2178.41s -> 2185.61s]  while he does that. And it's like, oh, it's like kind of fucking bad junior, but like it was good
[2185.61s -> 2190.49s]  enough for us to like clap and be like, okay, now let's wait. Where's the fucking carved turkey?
[2197.51s -> 2223.72s]  I need a foot pedal and I need real. That's doesn't even fucking work when I press the button.
[2223.72s -> 2232.28s]  Why? Can I like put that on my toe? I can't even see you guys. You got a fucking motorcycle game.
[2232.28s -> 2261.96s]  Fucked it all up. All right. That's good enough. I don't care. That's good enough. I don't care.
[2262.04s -> 2265.56s]  That's good enough. That's good enough. That's good enough. I clapped at my high school fucking
[2265.56s -> 2279.74s]  party. I don't care. Wait, was it small this whole time? God damn it. Why the fuck is this
[2279.74s -> 2294.34s]  happening? Why can't I see you two? You two? What do you mean you two? There are more than two of
[2294.34s -> 2304.15s]  you here. All right. We're going to move on to, oh dear. I don't even know if I can play this one
[2304.15s -> 2317.98s]  right now. I did want to check out Blade and Sorcery's new content. I heard there was new
[2317.98s -> 2328.70s]  shit in here. So give me one second while I fix the chat. I'll be right back. Fucking motorcycle
[2328.70s -> 2527.59s]  game. I swear to God. Fucking motorcycles. Fuck. Oh my fucking God. Fuck. Fucking motorcycle game
[2527.59s -> 2554.98s]  sucks. I'm going to fucking piss my pants. Okay. We're good. You guys ready for some more fucking
[2554.98s -> 2589.35s]  VR? No. God damn it, man. I heard you playing. Yeah, I mean, I was trying to fix the chat.
[2590.84s -> 2596.52s]  Every like, every like 25 seconds probably was said like, fucking stupid fucking thing sucks.
[2599.59s -> 2613.75s]  I just was trying to get the chat on. He was rehearsing secretly. Okay. Well, that sure was
[2613.75s -> 2633.35s]  a fucking blast now, wasn't it? I want to play the Blade and Sorcery update. Oh God, what the fuck
[2633.35s -> 2664.58s]  have I done now? We're good. It only took like fucking 20 years. It only took 20 fucking years.
[2664.58s -> 2678.74s]  Don't ever fucking buy that motorcycle game. Donate your money to charity instead.
[2679.30s -> 2714.07s]  All right, let's go. He grew in size. All right, so what's the update? All right, let's go.
[2714.07s -> 2729.85s]  There's an update apparently. Magic. What's that? I think I've got to play the game. All right,
[2729.85s -> 2739.37s]  let's go. There's armor now? Is there really? Who's the destination? All right, so is this
[2739.37s -> 2755.00s]  new destinations too? We've got arena, canyon. I've seen the canyon. Ruins. Zinado? First they're on
[2755.00s -> 2774.01s]  screen. Virtual reality. Virtual reality. Settle down. All right, we're okay. Fucking okay. What
[2774.01s -> 2793.18s]  have we not seen? No. And he's new. He's going mental. I'll just try one. Whatever.
[2799.03s -> 2809.16s]  Actually losing it. I was fine until I opened up a game and it deleted my whole computer. Why
[2809.16s -> 2818.04s]  does my arm feel like bigger? You know, I feel like my head is too close to my hands. Does that
[2818.04s -> 2824.71s]  make sense? I feel like I'm like this. All right, I want to see. I need any new weapons.
[2825.51s -> 2846.66s]  Yes. What's wrong with my hair? I do this, right? I lift it up and then how do you throw it, right?
[2847.46s -> 2870.04s]  How do you throw things? Stop. I'm getting sad. What are you talking about, dude? Wow. What?
[2878.30s -> 2884.46s]  Oh my God. Oh, the wind tunnel was sure was fun.
[2887.91s -> 2903.99s]  Fucking Mars attacks alien. Hold on a minute. Fuck man. Can I just get a break for a second?
[2905.37s -> 2910.41s]  What good fucking that fucking motorcycle came. Fuck that motorcycle came. Fucked up everything.
[2912.25s -> 2931.62s]  Count Dracula. All right, get me in here please. Get me please in here so I can start streaming
[2931.62s -> 2947.98s]  the fucking video game. That's a literal Vegeta hair. Fuck. Dude, I can't. I can't right now. I
[2947.98s -> 2952.14s]  can't do that right now. We can't talk like this right now. Where are the weapons, dude?
[2953.02s -> 2976.28s]  What do you mean fight in progress? I need something. I don't have any fucking weapons.
[2976.28s -> 2990.47s]  I'm just being chased by a lady with a knife. Shit. What do I just activate?
[3015.96s -> 3042.04s]  Stay away from me. Stay away from me. I'm a psycho. My computer can't handle this.
[3042.84s -> 3057.22s]  My computer is lagging. I fucking had a computer lag. Wait, I know what to do. I know how to fix
[3057.22s -> 3065.48s]  that. I know how to fix that. I got it. Trust me. Don't worry. I'll fix it in a second. I know
[3065.48s -> 3091.45s]  what to do. Why did you hold this like this? I got you. I need to pause the game. I'm going to
[3091.45s -> 3111.30s]  pause the game. Pause the game for a second. I got to win. Don't do it. Don't do it.
[3112.68s -> 3151.29s]  Don't do it. Don't do it. That's a mistake. Must destroy the humans. I'm going to fix the lag now.
[3151.29s -> 3162.94s]  Check this shit out. Ready? Lag's going to be gone in three, two, one. Check this out.
[3162.94s -> 3189.93s]  Look at that. Lag is gone. Told you I was fucking capable of it. Fuck. Why am I so stupid? Okay.
[3192.92s -> 3202.52s]  How do I do the magic? It was a magic update? I thought I cut my finger off.
[3203.72s -> 3229.88s]  I was like, oh, that's great. Whatever. Hold down A button. They added a kick.
[3234.39s -> 3248.84s]  Look at me. There's a kick. I need to get a person here to fight. I want to just sit down here and
[3248.84s -> 3260.84s]  just be like, come on and get me. Can I activate this stuff? I got to get this down. It's been a
[3260.84s -> 3284.86s]  while. Do you flick it, right? Or do you just push? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3285.74s -> 3308.28s]  All right. Let's activate the next one. Die? I mean, that's really fucking far.
[3309.00s -> 3324.71s]  All right. Respawn. How do I respawn? Oh, why don't I? Didn't there a lightsaber mod?
[3325.35s -> 3360.84s]  Can you do pogo like last time? I don't know. Oh, the storage. Wait, what's this? Oh, Jesus.
[3375.11s -> 3414.15s]  Oh, yeah. Where they at? Where they go? Didn't they run by me? Holy shit. He was waiting for me.
[3414.15s -> 3449.14s]  Can I take that? Hello, come get me. Where the hell is everybody? All right. Let's wily
[3449.14s -> 3461.59s]  coyote this guy. Oh, no. Oh, shit. Wait, did I get wily coyoted? Oh, no. This is when the thing
[3461.59s -> 3550.04s]  falls and I go. Give me this. Oh, get him. Wait, can I like strangle people? Get him. Fuck.
[3550.92s -> 3583.06s]  I hate you motherfucker. Where'd that guy go? Oh, here's somebody. Give me the fucking sword.
[3587.40s -> 3597.74s]  Holy shit. She's fall down the stairs. They pull the fucking bows and arrows.
[3601.43s -> 3627.05s]  Why is it lagging? And why can't I keep this in my ear? It's lagging so bad. Shoot. Come here.
[3627.53s -> 3646.76s]  Come here. Listen. Listen to me. You got to stay in school. You got to study every day. Look at me.
[3646.76s -> 3650.76s]  You don't want to end up like this. You don't want to end up in constant fucking war.
[3651.40s -> 3659.58s]  Look at me. You can't even look at your dear old dad anymore. You got to fight for how many
[3659.58s -> 3664.62s]  voice cracks are going to happen here in the next 20 seconds. Don't look. Don't look at him. Don't.
[3670.14s -> 3672.06s]  Let me tell you one last thing before I go.
[3673.64s -> 3677.32s]  Reef case with all the money in it. You'll never fucking know.
[3692.18s -> 3707.72s]  Ow. Oh, shit. It's coming in grease. Where's Kevin McAllister? He greased up the ladder.
[3708.36s -> 3715.40s]  Honey, what's the kick button? What's the kick button?
[3715.40s -> 3751.74s]  Get away from me. Get away. I'm going on the slide. No. Mom. Mom. Get out of here. It's my turn.
[3752.38s -> 3763.32s]  Get away from me. I want to kick him in the face so bad.
[3763.32s -> 3819.35s]  Oh, my God. I can't, dude. Go up here. Go up. Go up. Go up. Go up. What is this? I don't know
[3819.35s -> 3846.15s]  what this is. Where am I? How did I get behind the ladder? What? They left. Oh, my God. My fucking
[3846.15s -> 3900.58s]  stomach hurts. Hear that? Hello? My computer's lagging so bad. Ow. Come here. Put that down.
[3900.58s -> 3930.97s]  Put that down. Put that down. Put that down. Oops. Give me that. Give me that. Holy shit.
[3931.61s -> 4007.50s]  No arrow. Yeah. It didn't work. Ew. Yucky. Why is my game lagging? What's with all the lag, man?
[4007.50s -> 4030.25s]  Any bodies? Turn the graphics down? I can't. I turned down some of the lighting. Did that help?
[4030.25s -> 4050.28s]  Oh, man. That was fucking so funny. F4. What do we got? Okay. Camera stabilization. I don't know.
[4050.28s -> 4069.83s]  Motion blur off. What was that? Alt F4. That's not going to do anything. Change the map. Okay.
[4069.83s -> 4089.56s]  Change it in the game. Oh. I forgot how much fun this game actually was. Game is a joy. All right.
[4090.04s -> 4098.14s]  From... Oh, shit. That's my powers. This is the update. This is the update, isn't it?
[4103.38s -> 4121.94s]  Use magic and slow motion. All right. So, I have fire activated. How do I use the fire? Trigger.
[4121.94s -> 4134.10s]  What? Oh, my God. That's so cool. That's unbelievable. All right. I got to change
[4134.10s -> 4154.33s]  the graphics. How do I get it? Let me change the graphics. Get the hell out of here. Handbook.
[4154.41s -> 4181.67s]  Button on the controller. The menu button. Wait. Oh, shit. Here we go. Custom resolution multiplier.
[4181.67s -> 4194.01s]  Motion smoothing. What is all this? Under resolution. Motion smoothing. Off. On. Oh,
[4194.01s -> 4209.51s]  I lost you guys. That's not it. Wrong in-game book. Another in-game book? It'll write touchpad.
[4218.63s -> 4229.78s]  The menu button opens this. Menu button. The raid? Oh, shit. Who came in?
[4237.54s -> 4246.57s]  Incredible Orb is playing Basmophobia. I thought it was Incredible Orb raiding. I was like,
[4246.57s -> 4265.93s]  how did that know? I can hold the camera of the right touchpad. I've hit every single button.
[4274.26s -> 4295.62s]  What the fuck is that? Menu. Oh, fuck. That scared the shit out of me. Who raided? Who raided?
[4298.04s -> 4308.06s]  Touchpad. Touchpad. Touchpad. Touchpad. I've hit every single button. Menu on left hand middle
[4308.06s -> 4331.43s]  trackpad? I can't leave the fucking game. Right touchpad and left menu button. What the fuck is
[4331.43s -> 4361.77s]  that kind of combo? It's right trackpad and left menu button? Oh, god damn it. All right. Let's go
[4361.77s -> 4377.05s]  to the... I'm going to use these new powers. Who raided though? Who raided actually? The raid song?
[4377.05s -> 4390.94s]  Okay. Craig. Thanks, Craig. For the raid. Wherever you guys are, I can't really see you.
[4398.31s -> 4411.03s]  How about the raid song? Oh, yeah, of course. Everybody get to the battlements. We've got to
[4411.83s -> 4423.21s]  raid. We've got to... Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Where are we going? How about the canyon?
[4425.10s -> 4438.06s]  Sandler? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Good. Thanks for the raid though. Seriously. Welcome, everybody.
[4438.06s -> 4441.86s]  We're going to play some VR today. I had a little bit of technical problems because I opened up a
[4441.86s -> 4454.42s]  fucking motorcycle game and it derailed the whole stream. I want... Yeah. You're going to... Oh,
[4454.42s -> 4474.95s]  okay. Let's go. You can do that. That's awesome. Unlimited power. Let me show you the true
[4475.19s -> 4486.30s]  power of the dark side. Oh, that's not supposed to happen. Oh, that's not supposed to happen at all.
[4487.18s -> 4492.70s]  Oh, I'm just an old fucking man without electricity. What? Why did that not work?
[4494.73s -> 4502.81s]  Oh, I'm in trouble now. I can barely cross the fucking road on my own. Oh, shoot. Oh, shoot.
[4502.89s -> 4508.31s]  This is really not good, is it? Usually I laugh and they get scared.
[4517.94s -> 4524.89s]  I lost my... Give me that fucking shield. Give me that shield. That shield, you bastard.
[4532.66s -> 4543.80s]  I'm so scared I'm going to fucking hit something in my room.
[4543.80s -> 4617.77s]  Okay. Oh, I'm running out of juice. Oh, I can't do it for much longer. Oh, boy. Anybody have an
[4617.77s -> 4656.01s]  iPhone charger? Dude, where do I get... Where do I get the fucking lightsabers? Is that just on
[4656.01s -> 4707.30s]  Steam Workshop? Is that easy to get? Oh, it's not? Fuck. All right. I don't know. I'm breathing on
[4707.30s -> 4730.33s]  this. That's embarrassing. All right. Where's these graphics? Where's the graphics book? Okay.
[4730.33s -> 4739.19s]  Here we go. Graphics. Render scale. I'm going to turn that down. Shadows. Mom. Character. Fast
[4739.19s -> 4751.42s]  Gen. Character quality. Player. Whatever. NPC. I don't know. Impressions. Yeah. What was that?
[4752.06s -> 4780.38s]  Head drop. 0.75. Okay. Cool. All right, man. Let's go. Go to the market. Use magic on a weapon?
[4780.38s -> 4792.66s]  You can enchant a weapon? That's so cool. This might be the best VR game. It really might be.
[4793.30s -> 4822.89s]  All right. What about like electricity on a weapon? An electricity mug? I'm playing the best one.
[4822.89s -> 4827.45s]  Yeah. We're going to get to Alex tomorrow. Actually, I want to see this. Let me look through this.
[4827.45s -> 4851.48s]  Onyx? Oh, dude. That's... Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I got to be Wolverine from you too. Just give me
[4851.48s -> 4876.18s]  a weapon. Come on, bub. Okay. I like it so far. Let's go. Turn the trigger to pull.
[4878.30s -> 4919.40s]  Uh, fuck. Okay. Why can't I pick hard mode? T-Max alive. Totally. Oh. Oh, what the...
[4920.12s -> 4932.84s]  Circle of Death? Circle of Death. I don't know. More people playing games than I know, apparently.
[4933.56s -> 4944.02s]  Not allowed. Circle of Death. Where'd it go? Who's going to come in first?
[4944.74s -> 5020.23s]  It's right in the fucking kidney. Is it alive? Right in both of his ears. Hear that? All right.
[5020.23s -> 5034.76s]  Get the... Get this off. Get this... What the fuck? Uh... Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[5034.76s -> 5072.33s]  Come here. Come here. Come here. Um, come here. Why did I just... You're an idiot. He slid his own
[5072.33s -> 5126.76s]  throat. Now what? Back away. This exploded brain? Why is it so laggy? Which one would you like to die
[5126.76s -> 5134.06s]  by? Electricity, fire, or the force-exploded brain move? Which one? Yeah, I would have fixed
[5134.06s -> 5170.84s]  fire too. I would have fixed fire too. I'm an avid evil guy in an anime, aren't I? What? Too much
[5170.84s -> 5225.38s]  power. Too much power. Wow. Hey. You shut it off, you dick. Hey. Come here. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.
[5226.10s -> 5250.73s]  How dare you? You get out of here. He's so... He's not dead.
[5251.29s -> 5274.15s]  He's just in a scoop for wine. Listen, Jampa. You'll get it, okay? He's... When he comes in the
[5274.15s -> 5278.31s]  ring, you don't start swinging, all right? Don't just go right in after the bell. What, are you
[5278.31s -> 5285.30s]  out of your mind? Come on, kid. You got this. I know you got this. Come on. Remember. Step, slide,
[5285.30s -> 5291.70s]  punch. Step, slide, punch. Stay with me. Step, slide, punch. That's right. Get out. Get in there.
[5291.70s -> 5322.38s]  Get in there and get him. How the fuck do you know what's going on? Okay, listen. Oh,
[5322.38s -> 5335.90s]  shit. What did I do? Is he all right? Back away. You're away. I got the champ here.
[5352.25s -> 5357.27s]  Grab their body parts with that spell. The garbage cards suck so bad.
[5357.83s -> 5389.62s]  Does my computer suck? Combine spells? No, you cannot combine. That's just a shitty magic trick.
[5390.26s -> 5421.78s]  I gotta drop the graphics even more. Oh, that looks so bad. Get the 3090 already? I would've
[5421.78s -> 5441.05s]  got the 3090, but they made like 15 of them. All right, what about this canyon? Find the purple one.
[5453.14s -> 5495.27s]  What the fuck was that? It's nothing. Oh, fuck. What happened? I have my own. It's a gigantic.
[5517.88s -> 5568.52s]  Come here. Come here. Come here. Don't look into it.
[5569.08s -> 5639.26s]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. He's alive? I'm shooting. You just run on them.
[5657.27s -> 5659.75s]  You really good shot there.
[5660.71s -> 5701.53s]  Next. Well, I got you. Get out. Get out. Ow. Can I get some help? Somebody can help me.
[5702.25s -> 5722.18s]  Wait, I know what to do. I need leverage. There we are.
[5722.18s -> 5756.15s]  I hit my fucking head right here. Real tragedy. I don't think you guys can even see that.
[5757.54s -> 5773.19s]  Am I okay? I think so. Actual blood. No, this is this. We heard it. I want to see it. I want to
[5773.19s -> 5779.45s]  see it. Get play space boundaries. Ah, well, here, let me, I'm going to come in close for you
[5779.45s -> 5788.17s]  here. The reason why I don't have play space boundaries is because, um, well, I have it at
[5788.17s -> 5797.13s]  standing room only, but I still move around like I'm a fucking dickhead. I have to move around. I
[5797.13s -> 5806.02s]  can't not move around in VR. Oh, how long? Let me go take a piss and make sure that I didn't like
[5806.10s -> 5819.27s]  scuff up the front of my head. I'll be right back. It's a dent.
[6017.05s -> 6035.82s]  All right, let's see. I'm fine. Look, look at this hair. No, that's not a mark from, that's a mark.
[6037.11s -> 6055.82s]  Goodness. That's a mark from the headband. Where is the, where is the headband? Hey,
[6055.82s -> 6441.21s]  where's the headband? I don't know. I'll be right back. I gotta find it. Battle for glory.
[6442.09s -> 6446.25s]  You're leading the way to victory. Fight among your people and the Empire.
[6447.45s -> 6482.97s]  All right. You, you and me. All right. Fine, buddy. Oh shit there. What do we want to win?
[6483.61s -> 6519.24s]  I missed. Don't move. Don't you move. You listen to me. You and I are going to team up.
[6519.24s -> 6523.14s]  You're going to team up. We're going to kill those guys over there. You understand?
[6525.59s -> 6587.11s]  I'll do it. Hey, fuck. All right. Get out of my way. Wait a minute. I can grab his hand.
[6588.23s -> 6607.13s]  Wait a second. Look, I can grab his hand. Let's go. It's time to go home. Get in the car.
[6607.85s -> 6639.54s]  Come on. Come here. Let's go. Let's go. Come on. You're ruining my fucking joke. It's so laggy.
[6639.54s -> 6667.64s]  I can't even fling. Come on. I can't even see what I'm doing. I'm about to crash this fucking
[6667.64s -> 6694.76s]  computer, man. Okay. Okay. Okay. I've had, I've had just about enough of you. Give me the axe.
[6714.74s -> 6727.02s]  Killed me. He was just behind me the whole time. Oh my God. It's so laggy. Punk. No honor among
[6727.02s -> 6745.16s]  thieves. No honor among thieves. There ain't no honor among thieves anymore. Okay, let's go.
[6745.16s -> 6757.32s]  Update fucked up performance by a lot. Really? This feels like really bad. Even when we come,
[6757.32s -> 6769.90s]  usually it gets back to like 80, 60, 70, 80 frames a second. You know what I mean? It's like
[6771.51s -> 6785.91s]  memory leak or something. I don't know. What does that mean? Post-processing? NES resolution.
[6786.47s -> 6825.99s]  That feels the same. Next game. What am I doing next? Enable motion smoothing? Projection in
[6825.99s -> 6839.43s]  Steam VR. 1v1 game mode using more processing power than the graphics card. We'll play the room.
[6839.43s -> 6847.94s]  It's time to relax. It's time for the relaxing portion of this room. Saw 2. I'm going to download
[6847.94s -> 6857.78s]  the lightsaber thing. This game is fucking hilarious though. It's so much fun. It just
[6857.78s -> 6865.42s]  kind of runs like shit lately, like I would know. All right. Let's play the room. It's time to chill
[6865.42s -> 6870.18s]  out. I'm looking forward to this. I've actually been waiting for this. When I heard this came out,
[6870.18s -> 6882.81s]  I was ecstatic. This is going to be the ultimate in Pog video games. You guys are going to be so
[6882.81s -> 6901.37s]  happy about this. Okay. Where is it? The room. All right. Here we go. I hope this is what I think it
[6901.37s -> 6916.92s]  is. It's going to be awesome. It's going to be fucking fantastic. I can't wait. No, not the room.
[6918.44s -> 6954.78s]  Like Tommy Wiseau. We got free center in the windows. Yeah, this just looks good. That brings
[6954.78s -> 6964.42s]  me back. Yeah. And look, we have actual frames. Are you already disappointed? Time that person
[6964.42s -> 6975.93s]  out for 30 seconds. I have no idea. The room VR dark matter supports multiple profiles. I'm sure
[6975.93s -> 6980.81s]  it does. This is a game about, okay, let me, let me give you an example. This is a game about,
[6981.78s -> 7000.97s]  it's a game about and about and you don't understand soon enough. I need hints sometimes.
[7000.97s -> 7009.58s]  It can be kind of fucking hard. Standing. Please calibrate your standing height for the most
[7009.58s -> 7012.94s]  comfortable gameplay experience. Stand still in the center of your play area and press calibrate.
[7022.50s -> 7032.57s]  Boomsbury police station. Getting dark. I should get back to work. I can't wait to open up like
[7032.57s -> 7055.38s]  three boxes. Oh, sick. We're at the projector handle with dozens of disappearances in just
[7055.38s -> 7064.76s]  a few weeks, but this is one of the strangest. Bird area of the British Institute of Archeology
[7064.76s -> 7074.70s]  where the professor was last seen. How can someone disappear from this? Dr. Montgomery
[7074.70s -> 7078.78s]  specialized in priceless Egyptian relics. He told colleagues he was on the verge of some great
[7078.78s -> 7093.64s]  discovery. There you are. This is the piece the professor was studying when he disappeared.
[7098.76s -> 7102.12s]  Nothing else was missing. No evidence of a struggle or break in. It doesn't make sense.
[7102.12s -> 7112.97s]  I should check my desk in case the sergeant has left a report. The gentleman was asking
[7112.97s -> 7118.07s]  after you. He gave me a parcel, said it would help with the disappearances. The damn thing was
[7118.07s -> 7123.91s]  making the strangest noise. The constable told me he was hearing things. I put it in your wall safe.
[7123.91s -> 7135.67s]  You want whatever. Pick up the key. Excellent. Let it go to put it in your inventory. Okay,
[7135.67s -> 7151.59s]  what's this? Can I open the inventory? I mean, it's just so intuitive. That's an intuitive
[7151.59s -> 7168.65s]  inventory. To get this open, there's something in evidence storage. I gotta go to evidence storage.
[7170.25s -> 7177.37s]  I cannot wait to fucking play this game. Evidence storage. I wonder if we confiscated something
[7177.37s -> 7187.21s]  that can help me crack a safe that'll be listed on the blackboard. Oh, safe cracking. William
[7187.21s -> 7196.90s]  Crack. He cracks saves. William Clark. Safe cracking. Box number. I don't know. Please file
[7196.90s -> 7201.08s]  evidence with the correct case number for me. The filing system isn't that complicated. Your
[7201.08s -> 7216.60s]  detectives work it out. John E. Assault. E3. Aldem Wright. WW2. William Crack. C6.
[7217.48s -> 7238.60s]  Wilco Streamer. Loves game. Hates chat. Oh, the hints only show up if you can't figure anything.
[7239.72s -> 7245.70s]  Look, do you see all these little gears and shit? I can't wait. This is gonna be so
[7246.26s -> 7273.27s]  fun. Clipboard. This thing. A wine opener. Back to the safe. Where do I put this?
[7275.13s -> 7289.03s]  D-crack is safe? Oh, you mean, you mean me turn around? Don't you like put it, how do I put it
[7289.03s -> 7316.73s]  somewhere? Mic is fucked. The mic is fucked up? Why is the mic fucked up? Mic is fucked up? What
[7316.73s -> 7325.61s]  did I do to it? I don't know. I don't know. Was it when I bumped into it? When I smashed into it?
[7334.26s -> 7338.14s]  Maybe when I hit it. Sounds the same. I don't know.
[7338.94s -> 7342.86s]  Alright, how do I put this? How do I get this on here? No, no, no, no, no, no, it's okay.
[7342.86s -> 7349.96s]  This should not, I, there's a hint available to pull the tip. Now that I have the safe cracker,
[7349.96s -> 7373.86s]  I can get to work on the safe. Yeah, I, what do you, what? Oh, it's so satisfying. Oh, I love it.
[7373.86s -> 7403.03s]  Alright, we're gonna turn some dials here. Shit, almost. Yeah. Loves it. I do love it.
[7403.59s -> 7427.02s]  Forgive my unorthodox approach detective, but I have vital information relating to a case
[7427.02s -> 7431.34s]  you're investigating. We have questions, so please take these lenses and let me show you
[7431.34s -> 7460.36s]  what I can explain. This is the only, the beginning. Craftsman. Take the lenses? I got,
[7460.36s -> 7476.94s]  wait, wait, wait, wait. First box. I mean, usually it's like a box with a box and then a box inside
[7476.94s -> 7481.80s]  of a box. Open the inventory and pull the highlighted tab to put on the eyepiece.
[7503.37s -> 7511.19s]  Alright, this is the real first box. You don't have any idea how happy I am to be playing this.
[7511.19s -> 7522.33s]  Alright, so what do we got? We got, let's examine the box. Got that. Got this. Moon,
[7522.33s -> 7527.05s]  moon with a star on it. I don't know, any of these move? Yup, there you go. Look at that. Okay,
[7527.05s -> 7549.18s]  here we go. Then pull that tab. Tabs. Hey, looking good. You want tabs? Right here, look at this.
[7549.74s -> 7588.15s]  Thank you. Okay, now what? Whoa, project anything? Wait a minute. Yes. Boom, this is the VR made
[7588.15s -> 7610.25s]  of room. Welcome detective to the hidden realm of the Gnoll. The disappearances you are investigating
[7610.25s -> 7614.57s]  are part of something more sinister than you can imagine. Show you what happened to these people
[7614.57s -> 7620.33s]  and perhaps together we can avert any further loss. This document is no ordinary letter. The
[7620.33s -> 7626.09s]  Gnoll connects it to me. This author used the eyepiece to reveal the connection. Find the others,
[7626.09s -> 7650.65s]  discover their fates. The Craftsman. Oh, the British Institute of Archaeology. This is the room Dr.
[7650.65s -> 7657.67s]  Montgomery was working when he disappeared. How did I get back here? So many toys to play with
[7657.67s -> 7679.96s]  in here. I can't. This is the arm made. What does it do? I don't know yet. We gotta do, we gotta do
[7679.96s -> 7693.67s]  it one by one here. I gotta get something over here. I can't do this yet. What about over here?
[7694.31s -> 7716.36s]  What's this? All right, we need a piece for this. Something goes right there. It's like a lady's
[7716.36s -> 7726.73s]  face. Whatever it is. Hey, check chat. Gonna take him five hours? Hey, I am a veteran of the room.
[7726.73s -> 7735.21s]  Okay, I'll have you know. I'm not just some scrub that does not play. All right, what is this?
[7735.21s -> 7746.17s]  The poster pulled the sarcophagus from the storage room. Take through. Take to a practice of taking
[7746.17s -> 7751.13s]  about followers with them throughout their life. They believe this rite could rapid contain their
[7751.13s -> 7755.61s]  souls, but the hieroglyphics don't follow any known lexicon. Does it make any sense?
[7756.57s -> 7770.12s]  All right, well, I don't, I wanna, I can figure this. Let's do this. What do we got here?
[7770.84s -> 7787.83s]  Touch this yet? That, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, what's going on here?
[7788.39s -> 7817.35s]  A piece? Yeah, that means something. What does that mean? Grab the mic sensitivity?
[7819.72s -> 7826.66s]  Why are people talking about the mic? I must have fucked something up when I punched it and
[7826.66s -> 7839.58s]  ripped out a cord or something. It's the wrong mic? Oh, when I turn around, you can't hear me.
[7839.58s -> 7842.86s]  I get you. All right. Well, we can't, we, we gotta get something that fits in here.
[7842.86s -> 7861.90s]  I can't grab this, right? No, can't do this yet. What about this guy? No, can't open that.
[7861.90s -> 7874.89s]  Oh shit. Hold on. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, whoa. All right. I got that open.
[7875.96s -> 7902.71s]  Now. Yeah, almost. That not it? That, I got it, right? No, it's blocked up there. It's blocked
[7902.71s -> 7915.59s]  up top. How do I release that shit? Oh, excuse me. Behind you. What the fuck, dude? You're a
[7915.67s -> 7930.74s]  warp has a face. This is to open the door, right? Probably over there.
[7937.34s -> 7960.12s]  Uh, I don't have any face words, dude. What am I missing? I'm missing something here.
[7971.77s -> 7985.50s]  Like open that, but I can't. I don't get this all the way. That's open. Not even in the cameras.
[7986.30s -> 8013.22s]  Fuck. I thought that was a one real wall. Hey, I'm back. How are you? I can't pick that up.
[8014.02s -> 8021.42s]  What did I miss here? Something something's here that I missed. I guess I could just travel with
[8021.42s -> 8039.64s]  this thing. We'd go somewhere else. You have to go somewhere else. Oh, what was that? That's a
[8039.64s -> 8057.13s]  sarcophagus. Nice beer gut. The door is unlocked, but too heavy to open by hand. There's a rope
[8057.13s -> 8065.50s]  attached to it that leads to a set of pulleys though. Yeah, I know. Beer gut. It's not a beer
[8065.50s -> 8085.35s]  gut. It's a, it has to be something with this by hand. So I need to do this thing. I open this
[8085.35s -> 8096.98s]  coming out, but it can't just Nancy. This is way better than Nancy Drew. Hey, yo, got mesh. Shut up
[8099.75s -> 8113.35s]  and Turkey peanut oil diet for the right side of the door. But can I, I can't really go over here.
[8120.76s -> 8137.02s]  Like this is connected to that. How do I get this to move? How do I get this to like,
[8137.34s -> 8158.92s]  how do I get this to turn? Get the fuck out of the goddamn way here. What's a punch? Whatever's in
[8158.92s -> 8194.36s]  front of me. Can I, can I, can I pull? Oh shit. Look at that. Let's go get this shit out. Oh yeah.
[8194.36s -> 8209.24s]  That's a big guy right there. Porter was back asking about my progress. A curious fellow. He
[8209.24s -> 8215.32s]  seemed almost confused that I couldn't crack the code. He gave me a parcel, said it had been left
[8215.32s -> 8221.00s]  for me in the post room. Inside was an odd looking lens along with a note that said the lens would
[8221.00s -> 8238.20s]  help me in my work. Goodness knows that it was going to help me. What do you got? I hit him in
[8238.20s -> 8253.40s]  the head with a, with a crowbar. Oh shit. Brass. Wait, wait, wait. Wasn't there a circle somewhere
[8253.40s -> 8274.98s]  that needed a circle? Something needed a circle here. Where did this need to go? Cursor for
[8274.98s -> 8295.50s]  cursor. Mouse on the screen. You guys call the, did I get it? Did I get it? Over here? Right there,
[8295.50s -> 8320.52s]  right? Shit. Where'd this fucking go? Head? Want it back. Doesn't know shapes. In the book.
[8341.24s -> 8358.17s]  Oh, that just spawned something in there. We gotta spawn. Yep. The eyepiece. Oh yeah.
[8358.89s -> 8385.40s]  Fuck is that? He'll do, okay. We got a lot of shit going on here. That's new. What did I just do?
[8386.04s -> 8406.25s]  Did I win? What? I just pressed, did I press it, did I do it? Everybody understand what just happened?
[8407.05s -> 8423.10s]  I had to unlock. Yeah, I did. But how do I open? Should be unlocked then, right?
[8424.30s -> 8432.63s]  That easy? Or am I doing something wrong? I feel like you have to like move this.
[8433.59s -> 8442.55s]  Please smash the reddit shelf. I'm, I don't want that to happen. That'd be something I'm doing wrong
[8442.55s -> 8460.18s]  here. Need something to put in there. Oh, that AC feels so fucking good right now. I'm such a
[8460.18s -> 8482.44s]  degenerate. I thought this was a slot machine. That we need a triangle pointing up. I just won
[8482.44s -> 8500.46s]  accidentally. And now what? Okay. That's going to go this way. This one, right? What, rabbit?
[8503.93s -> 8519.93s]  20 to here. And what animal? What's the animal? Uh, where does that go? That's, that'll fit this.
[8522.82s -> 8532.66s]  Oh shit. I've got a tool. Okay. All right. It's getting more, we're getting more interesting here.
[8535.18s -> 8551.61s]  Animal. Generate gambler. Generate gambler. What is it? What's the shape? Like a little claw.
[8552.25s -> 8571.11s]  Wait, can I do that? It's vibrating like I can. Oh shit. There's even more of this crap.
[8571.83s -> 8595.70s]  No mouse on the screen. Wait a minute. Come on. Really? That's not like the tool to like break
[8595.70s -> 8617.34s]  into his head. I see this now. Nothing new from that. Touch him. Find him at the beginning.
[8619.51s -> 8631.29s]  Oh, tool, tool, tool, tool, tool, tool, tool. Tool, tool, tool. Check it out. Oh yeah. Sick.
[8639.70s -> 8662.70s]  Nice. Open up. Oh, the distinctively shaped head. I need to turn that. Brave stone disc. It's a
[8663.18s -> 8672.07s]  that goes over there. How do I move this? Okay. Wait, wait, wait. We got, um, uh, eagle and
[8674.07s -> 8689.05s]  flamingo and stop. Flamingo and, uh, bee. Wasp. Flamingo, wasp. What do we got here? Flamingo,
[8690.89s -> 8711.75s]  wasp. Ow. Where's the, where is it? Flamingo, wasp. We're over here. Read chat for a second.
[8711.75s -> 8729.14s]  I'm here. Actually on screen. Saved. Saved. All right. We're good. I got flamingo selected.
[8729.14s -> 8742.36s]  So now I got that tool. Right? Yeah. All right. Let's go back over here. The reason why this game
[8742.36s -> 8747.64s]  is so much fun. All right. Let me fucking actually talk to you guys. The reason why this game is fun
[8747.64s -> 8751.80s]  is because one thing leads to another thing. Another thing leads to this. That opens that,
[8751.80s -> 8771.08s]  that opens that box and then that box opens on its own. Wait, I got a match. Okay. Hold on. Give me
[8771.08s -> 8794.98s]  a minute. Got to be green or is it going to be green? Red and blue and wait, did they? Oh fuck.
[8796.28s -> 8813.03s]  Okay. I, uh, they all have to be red. Rubik's cube. I mean, does it have to be red, green and
[8813.83s -> 8849.51s]  that's it. That's it. I got it. I did it. Let's go. Open up. What the hell does that do? Stuck his
[8849.51s -> 8882.92s]  tongue out at me. I can't even look at it now. You guys have ruined this for me. I can't, I can't.
[8882.92s -> 8901.66s]  Somebody said one thing and that's all it took. Okay. Well, now what do I do? These were instructions
[8901.66s -> 8911.54s]  on how to do the first part. I'm such an idiot. Wait, it came out of all four places. Wait,
[8911.54s -> 8945.42s]  not over here, right? What else did I not do? Over here? We got, I don't understand this part.
[8946.84s -> 8952.94s]  I'm looking for an animal. I guess we could, it's one of the four chance. Of course we could
[8952.94s -> 8975.75s]  just guess. What is this? Uh, yep. Another one of those. Okay. Flamingo. It's another, it's a one
[8975.75s -> 8993.43s]  out of four chance. Okay. I'm going to get from that box. I am going to get a flamingo. Oh,
[8993.43s -> 9006.22s]  why, why does the cursor keep coming back? I'm not doing that. You're clear. I'm clearly across
[9006.22s -> 9026.07s]  the whole room. All right. Think. Think for a second. Think. Can't move this. This is the
[9026.07s -> 9031.74s]  tool that I'm going to be able to slide in here and then pull this out. Press her again? No.
[9031.74s -> 9048.02s]  Pulley system can lift up the mummy. Can it? Goodness. Look at you. Look at what you just said.
[9048.66s -> 9073.45s]  Quite a different pulley now. Is there a dog? Oh shit. Look at this. I'm pretty strong in this.
[9073.45s -> 9079.88s]  I knew that was going to happen. Pull it back up.
[9089.53s -> 9098.57s]  Okay. It is a dog. All right. It's Otto. Um, he can't really come in here right now.
[9099.45s -> 9104.82s]  What am I going to do about that? He can't come in here right now. I'll be like, Oh, Otto,
[9104.82s -> 9113.91s]  where is he? I don't want to step on him. Let me see what he wants. Let him in. No, that's dangerous.
[9113.91s -> 9120.41s]  I don't want to, I could, I could like hurt him. All right. Let me, hold on. Let me go see what he
[9120.41s -> 9129.72s]  wants. Hold on. All right. Let me see what he wants. I think he might, maybe he wants to go.
[9129.72s -> 9214.42s]  Give me one sec. I'll be right back. He's here. He's in the room. I just wanted to come in. He's
[9214.42s -> 9220.58s]  all the way in the corner over there. So he's, he's not in any, uh, play area. There's no reason
[9220.58s -> 9232.49s]  why I would ever go all the way over there. Oh him? I don't know what I'm doing. Right over here.
[9232.49s -> 9249.03s]  He just wanted to come and lie down on a blanket. He is, he is like all I've, there's no reason why
[9249.03s -> 9251.91s]  I would go over there. He just wanted to come in and hang out. You said that's all you wanted?
[9255.45s -> 9271.37s]  We did it boys. Hey, you having fun in the room? I'm looking forward to this game for like a
[9271.37s -> 9280.01s]  hundred years and half like, half like, half, uh, like, you know, like half like, uh, half
[9280.01s -> 9285.66s]  like Alex, like doing that tomorrow. And that's what we're doing the whole stream. So that's why
[9285.66s -> 9291.93s]  I want to play a few of the games that I had lined up that are not half life Alex. That's
[9291.93s -> 9303.80s]  what we're doing all stream tomorrow. Fucking motorcycle game. It looked fun too. That's the
[9303.80s -> 9321.45s]  worst part about it. The game is this. This is called the room VR a dark matter. Come out on
[9321.45s -> 9337.35s]  screen. No, I don't have, I don't have a feed. I don't know what happened here, but we can get
[9338.47s -> 9346.71s]  back to normal. That'd be good. All right. So thanks for the one guy. That was a really good
[9346.71s -> 9365.34s]  advice to lift up the sarcophagus with the other thing. Pretty sick. Well, I need my team of
[9365.34s -> 9372.73s]  assistants to play VR. It'll be like three people in the room. One to make sure I don't hit a wall.
[9373.29s -> 9406.15s]  One to make sure I can hear the audio until I take care of my dog. I got that ball. I could sense
[9406.15s -> 9418.89s]  the shelf. I could smell it. Whoa. I got his beard. I can't like take his beard off. What is
[9418.89s -> 9437.80s]  this for? I put like a walnut in here. Oh, no, no, no. I got the, what's the globe for
[9437.80s -> 9461.91s]  and a little circle. What the fuck are you talking about? I need an animal. We got it. Look at it.
[9461.91s -> 9469.83s]  We got, Oh, you're close. All right. You guys see an animal? Oh, this is probably important.
[9470.39s -> 9485.85s]  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I don't know what that does. I have that glove though. Let's
[9485.85s -> 9503.53s]  show. Can I put the globe in here? Mayo stomach. Damn it. Damn it. Ah, ah. What about in here?
[9511.18s -> 9539.19s]  Let's put it in his mouth. Add munkah. Hmm. What's munkah? Hmm. How do I do with this thing? Oh,
[9539.83s -> 9556.41s]  well, it looks like I got myself a sword, ceremonial dagger. That goes in his mouth,
[9556.41s -> 9578.82s]  right? You open the mouth and you slip it in. It goes there. No, this is not what you do.
[9579.93s -> 9606.42s]  I got a sword. Can it go over there? What the fuck was that? I just gave it to him. What does
[9606.42s -> 9649.21s]  it want me to do there though? Okay. It's a symbol. I don't swear in front of Otto. He's mean
[9649.21s -> 9684.02s]  something, but I don't know what they mean. Okay. Found it. It's dog pot. What the fuck does that
[9684.02s -> 9706.01s]  mean? Dog pot. Oh, that's just the solution to the thing that I guessed. Egger? Egger here? Oh,
[9711.38s -> 9733.13s]  yes. Okay. Now what? Faved cylinder. Here? I think this goes over here. It looks like it matches,
[9733.13s -> 9756.87s]  doesn't it? Going inside of his body somewhere? He missed four holes, man. I don't know which hole
[9756.87s -> 9773.16s]  it goes in. Look at that little indentation right there. Up your chair, up your ass. No,
[9774.14s -> 9805.62s]  no thanks. I think I'm okay. I think I'm going to be good. I do with you. It's a puzzle. It's a
[9805.62s -> 9807.86s]  puzzle. It's a puzzle. It's a puzzle. It's a puzzle. You're going to be in the right part of
[9807.86s -> 9827.58s]  the room. It's a puzzle. I have to be standing in the right part of the room. Oh shit. That's so
[9827.58s -> 9857.78s]  cool. That's so cool. Now what? Now what? Oh, let's get. Oh. Hellas. Let's go. It feels so good.
[9866.90s -> 9886.50s]  There? Open up. Bingo. Oh shit. Stone tile. And another thing. And I got the, what's the Harry
[9886.50s -> 9909.88s]  Potter thing that they all chase? What is that? Oh Lord. I got to rebuild like Stonehenge.
[9909.88s -> 9940.92s]  All right. Wait, that's not right. Okay. Oh, hold on. Bingo. There's the piece. The piece that we
[9940.92s -> 9952.44s]  need. And there's a bowl in there. Dude. Okay. Cool. Looking good. Sound design is really good.
[9952.44s -> 9961.83s]  Yeah. No, this would be their fifth game or sixth game in this series. I am begging you to go play
[9961.83s -> 9967.75s]  the room. At least the first one and the second one. If you like just like playing with little
[9967.75s -> 9973.43s]  trinkets and toys and clicking and boxes and shit. It's unbelievable. It's one of the most fun
[9973.43s -> 9978.63s]  series on steam right now. I don't know how much it is. It's less than like 15 bucks in it.
[9980.68s -> 9992.63s]  It's an ADHD game. Yeah. I mean, call it whatever you want. Okay. I have the other piece here.
[9993.27s -> 10021.91s]  Here we go. Definitely flamingo. Metal handle. Oh, where does this go? Oh, a decorated amulet.
[10028.50s -> 10055.10s]  Oh, wait. Oh, now they have a stone tile with a metal token in it. Now I got two tokens.
[10055.10s -> 10089.80s]  Uh, I thought that was going to be right. Tokens in his mouth. Not a bad idea. I mean,
[10089.80s -> 10093.40s]  it wasn't, it actually kind of was a bad idea. It really, it really was a bad idea.
[10096.73s -> 10126.60s]  Three tokens. Did I miss anything over here? This is done, right? This box is done. Yeah. Here we go.
[10126.60s -> 10193.22s]  Ooh, that makes a good clicking sound. Oh, fuck. Come on. Let's go. Okay. Let's bust in the box.
[10194.70s -> 10213.43s]  Find out. Here we go. Oh, wow. He's go in there. That's right. No, let's go put it inside of him.
[10213.43s -> 10226.62s]  So does it matter the order? Oh, this look, this is organs. This is a lungs. Heart. This is
[10226.62s -> 10247.42s]  intestine. I don't know. Kidneys. Brain. Heart. Uh, that's a heart, right? No, is this, this is a
[10247.42s -> 10257.32s]  liver? No, that's a stomach. That looks like a brain. This looks like a brain. Okay. Got it.
[10266.50s -> 10273.29s]  Thank you. Congratulations. You have completed my quest. Now please take the riches inside of my
[10273.29s -> 10312.33s]  chest. Yes. Whoa. It actually is a heart. Have to take his heart? Dude, guys, this is, I don't know
[10312.33s -> 10355.22s]  about it. All right, we got to go back to this. Not the string. I supposed to do that? Is he going
[10355.22s -> 10377.56s]  to be alive behind me? He's going to be alive behind me, isn't he? Oh, ice. Holy shit. Okay.
[10377.56s -> 10383.42s]  Oh, he's been here. He's always been here since the beginning, waiting, waiting at the beginning
[10383.42s -> 10390.78s]  at the temple. They all wait at the beginning. I see them. They aren't blind like me. Trump, right?
[10390.78s -> 10421.02s]  This, where are we going? Oh, the beginning. I feel like I'm at Disney world right now.
[10421.02s -> 10437.78s]  Let's do a Disney ride. It's a good one though. Oh, but this is the, how do I put this? Oh, hey,
[10437.78s -> 10458.01s]  loading that. I have two more of those to do. Oh, the note. Long one. Welcome back detective.
[10458.01s -> 10463.64s]  Perhaps now you can understand the danger we face. I mean, I don't really, I don't really know what
[10463.64s -> 10468.76s]  the danger is, but I guess it's scary. The artifact you collected now holds the very essence, the soul,
[10468.76s -> 10475.82s]  if you will, of the professor. Sacrifice will help further my work and bring these arcane forces
[10475.90s -> 10482.46s]  safely under my control. Onward to another of those lost unfortunates, a servant of God this time.
[10482.46s -> 10488.54s]  He was searching for some long forgotten relic. You must uncover what he found. A crack head.
[10489.10s -> 10510.49s]  Oh, we're in a church. Church, perhaps this reverend will have some answers for me.
[10522.90s -> 10533.72s]  We don't, let's go. Let's start our search. A box. And there's just a big ass key in here. You got
[10533.72s -> 10546.41s]  it. Cool. Okay, we got a door in front. Thing on the left. Go left. Oh, this is the podium. Okay.
[10548.50s -> 10553.78s]  Here. Six, one, five, eight, seven, three, nine, eight, one, four. Or it's probably going to be
[10553.78s -> 10560.50s]  some Sudoku math problem, right? The puzzle was fucking easy. The puzzle was just pretty good.
[10560.50s -> 10601.61s]  Oh, this door. It just opens. I got the key. I got the key, man. Oh, shit. All right, lots of
[10601.61s -> 10621.54s]  levers here. Maybe we should have done that. Where's Obi-Wan Kenobi here? An old man I've
[10621.54s -> 10626.50s]  not seen before approached me after Evan saw the legend of this chapel and the relic hidden
[10626.50s -> 10630.90s]  somewhere within these stone walls. He gave me a small box that it contained something that would
[10630.90s -> 10643.37s]  help me, something which would unlock truth. The well. Wait, wait, wait. We saw those, didn't we?
[10644.17s -> 10672.57s]  Yep. All right. N plus W thing. Plus E thing. There it is. Zoomers Maulding. Why do we have
[10672.57s -> 10680.76s]  Zoomers Maulding? All right, well, something obviously goes in there. I don't know what.
[10685.27s -> 10691.83s]  Goes in here, obviously. I don't know what. Oh, there's tons of places you can go through.
[10691.83s -> 10697.35s]  Miles the Templar's carried the cargo. An hour before midnight, the attack began.
[10698.31s -> 10729.62s]  That's a clock. How do I change the clock? There's a lot of space here. That's a plate
[10729.62s -> 10736.10s]  for the well, right? Mirror fragments set in stone? All right, whatever. It's a process, right?
[10736.74s -> 10753.82s]  Look at these books. Books? Wait, put the night vision on. Make sure there's nothing in there.
[10753.82s -> 10780.26s]  All right, I got the well. I'm good to go. That go in here. No, place to go behind me.
[10789.59s -> 10795.11s]  I mean, absolutely no disrespect. I mean, no disrespect in here, okay? I just say that all
[10795.11s -> 10806.17s]  the time. I say that all the time. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I really am sorry. Check auto. Oh,
[10806.17s -> 10827.91s]  he's okay. He's right over here. Auto is gone. He's right over here. We're concerned. He's right
[10827.91s -> 10835.80s]  there. He's okay. He's just chilling over there. He's lined up. Man out the window.
[10839.18s -> 10856.70s]  Okay, let's go. Is this for the clock? Well, I can't move that now. It's not. It's going to be.
[10857.26s -> 10869.27s]  There's going to be a whole thing here. Turn around. I have this bowl. What do I do with the
[10869.27s -> 10883.26s]  bowl? Can I get in here? What do I do with that bowl? I'm not going to steal auto's way over there.
[10887.42s -> 10902.15s]  Get a real job, German. Nine to five. How do we even respond to the get a job comment?
[10907.86s -> 10917.74s]  Hey, get a job. All right, dad. I'll do it. I got to get that to 11 o'clock.
[10918.46s -> 10938.94s]  Oh, hold on. Right there. First. Hold on a sec. Am I changing the clock? Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[10938.94s -> 10952.14s]  Is that doing anything? I don't know. I can't tell if this is doing anything.
[10953.72s -> 10972.09s]  Lock. I'm not doing shit. What are you talking about? I'm doing anything.
[10972.73s -> 10991.35s]  Well, I can go down there though with this. Oh, nice. Okay. Move it. Grab it.
[10993.51s -> 11011.48s]  I felt pretty good. Oh, this is telling somebody screenshot this. This is telling me something.
[11011.48s -> 11016.73s]  You'd like blue, black, yellow, white, blue, black, yellow, yellow, blue. Okay. Somebody
[11016.73s -> 11032.04s]  screenshot that. We're going to need it in like 10 minutes. Oh, that was completely wrong.
[11032.04s -> 11068.04s]  screenshot that now. I don't know why. I really don't know. I don't know why. I swear to God,
[11068.04s -> 11072.04s]  this is going to sound really weird. I just felt like for one second that my dick was out.
[11073.40s -> 11082.86s]  I'm weird. I just, I don't know. I just, I got a weird panic where I'm just like,
[11082.86s -> 11088.92s]  holy shit. I think, I think my dick is out. I don't know why that's getting to him.
[11089.64s -> 11107.70s]  All right. What else? What? I got that bowl back here with the numbers are over here.
[11107.70s -> 11117.85s]  There's numbers over here. Those two, wait a minute. Two, six, one, six, one, four, five,
[11117.85s -> 11122.81s]  eight. I need the four, four, five, eight, seven. Yeah. I need a four. What do we get the four?
[11126.33s -> 11162.76s]  Four over there, right? Let me do this bowl. How do I do that bowl? Oh, fuck. This one already,
[11162.76s -> 11170.20s]  right? Yeah. I did that one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's go. Something appeared over there.
[11170.84s -> 11175.26s]  But yeah, yeah, yeah. The box, you got it. Yep. Yep.
[11175.26s -> 11182.49s]  The crystals look unusual. Perhaps I should use the new lens to examine them.
[11183.21s -> 11199.69s]  Strange. It feels like I'm being pulled towards them. Oh my God. This is terrifying.
[11202.54s -> 11210.86s]  He just went up. He just went up. He just went to actual height. You see, with the actual size.
[11216.18s -> 11236.46s]  Should I jump around? Whoa. I'm inside of this thing. Oh, I guess I'm turning it. Oh goodness.
[11236.46s -> 11274.02s]  Okay. And then, whoa, there it is. What do I get? Glass decanter. Hey, that will fit.
[11274.90s -> 11277.46s]  Where's that going to, I know where that goes. That goes somewhere interesting.
[11279.58s -> 11289.58s]  Goblet of fire. Break it. Orb. Orb. Eat the orb. Eat the orb. Orb. Goblet of fire. No.
[11297.03s -> 11311.30s]  Oh, this decanter fits here, but it doesn't do anything. I must have missed something.
[11311.30s -> 11317.75s]  Oh, that makes me wicked thirsty. That just made me so thirsty. That makes me so thirsty.
[11317.75s -> 11325.42s]  I want to drink this so bad. This is just blue powerade, right? The way that it came into,
[11325.42s -> 11330.54s]  it was just blue powerade going in. I want a blue powerade right now, if anybody has any.
[11331.10s -> 11372.76s]  We get anything? Oh, the star. And you can go inside. Root forced it. I didn't root force
[11372.76s -> 11386.50s]  anything. There we go. This is my favorite part so far. I love that. I'm going to get a screenshot,
[11386.50s -> 11404.01s]  right? Oh, it's right there already. Thanks. Thank you. I'll upload that. Okay. There it is.
[11404.01s -> 11428.84s]  I got it. I had it. I did? I did. I just did it. I just did it. Did I do it? Blue, red, blue, red,
[11429.56s -> 11467.54s]  yellow, orange. Yeah, I got it. Yeah, I just did it, didn't I? That's correct. That's not just
[11467.54s -> 11500.55s]  correct. That was correct already. Wait a second. This isn't colorblind. I'm not colorblind. It's
[11500.55s -> 11529.48s]  going to spin it up. I'm going to spin it. Okay. Then we flip that around. It's right there. That's
[11529.48s -> 11563.83s]  it. I did it, but give it to me. I win. What am I doing wrong here? Do I have to like lock it in?
[11565.93s -> 11583.66s]  Like, yes, lock it in. Does it have to be the opposite? Except the one outside.
[11598.74s -> 11608.54s]  Isn't it right? In his own world. Yeah, but it's right, isn't it? Don't read chat. They're
[11608.54s -> 11613.74s]  just shaking it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can't wait until you get timed out for fucking five minutes.
[11615.51s -> 11625.30s]  I can't wait until you're gone for at least five minutes. Stop reading chat.
[11625.46s -> 11638.66s]  A little shaking. Oh, man. That person is right. That person's right.
[11643.30s -> 11654.65s]  Got to match that in here. Right. All right. So we need yellow, green.
[11675.05s -> 11729.27s]  I got to get the blue there. The wooden box. There's a large lever and two pulleys. I can
[11729.27s -> 11739.48s]  use it to change the pattern of light. A hint will be available when the timer has ended.
[11740.12s -> 11776.62s]  I can't cheat fast enough. And it more. That's not, that's wrong. I found on the stone door,
[11776.62s -> 11781.02s]  I could use the wooden box to shine a matching symbol at the door. So that's correct.
[11782.14s -> 11827.22s]  I already did it. That little guy right there. A chess. Oh, man. I just love that bullshit thing.
[11831.90s -> 11840.58s]  Um, Stormwind, who's the Stormwind guy? Like the shield of Stormwind, right?
[11840.58s -> 11847.21s]  I'll go check. Over there. Take that. Thank you.
[11848.01s -> 11859.70s]  Gonna make that. Somebody screenshot that. Hello, blue, pink, yellow, blue. Got it.
[11860.34s -> 11888.66s]  Oh, let's make that thing pink, yellow, blue. Sorry. That was okay. We're good.
[11888.66s -> 11915.13s]  Okay. We're not good. I'm getting tangled. Right. Well, shit. What was it? Pink, pink, yellow,
[11915.13s -> 11932.52s]  blue. But those were different. And I can't, I wouldn't purple. Uh, what is this? I think one
[11932.52s -> 11949.19s]  of these, this was flipped around. This one was up the other way. Like that. Right. I'll let you.
[11949.19s -> 11956.86s]  What the fuck are you doing, man? Like that. Right. And it was pink, yellow, blue. Is that it?
[11957.66s -> 11966.97s]  Did I get it? I think I got it. Why is the camera facing,
[11967.77s -> 11981.51s]  how come the camera's not facing the other person? Why is the camera facing you? That's it right
[11981.51s -> 11985.56s]  there. That's the one right there. All right. I got to face the camera at the right guy.
[11997.64s -> 12026.68s]  Um, I put a mirror over there. I sure do. That's something else on your back. Um, that's a mirror,
[12027.32s -> 12038.42s]  a mirror, um, hanging on his utility belt. I need something to go here. Um, this, some Tetris
[12038.42s -> 12052.58s]  piece has to go right here. Uh, it, it does not, does not suck or burst your bubble there, but
[12052.58s -> 12080.63s]  nope, I think you're very incorrect. How does this go? Our piece. Spin it. Up here?
[12082.50s -> 12111.94s]  There? Possible. Right here. Oh, I haven't been in here in a while. Was there anything in here I
[12111.94s -> 12132.28s]  could do? Uh, ha ha ha ha ha. Remember with the Victory Royale in room four.
[12137.50s -> 12159.51s]  Got another box, ladies and gentlemen. It's a big one. Not going there yet. Block picking tool,
[12159.51s -> 12163.54s]  Can I reach in here?
[12163.54s -> 12170.12s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[12170.12s -> 12172.12s]  Probably have to go in there first.
[12172.12s -> 12181.40s]  Oh, right.
[12181.40s -> 12184.47s]  I'm inside the vault.
[12184.47s -> 12187.93s]  I know I'm getting closer. I can feel it.
[12187.93s -> 12189.93s]  I hear it. Worlds within worlds.
[12189.93s -> 12191.93s]  The old man can't have known what this
[12191.93s -> 12193.93s]  lens revealed. Why would he give me something
[12193.93s -> 12199.62s]  this valuable?
[12199.62s -> 12209.93s]  Why would he do that?
[12209.93s -> 12220.73s]  Alright, let's see.
[12220.73s -> 12222.73s]  I need to pick this lock.
[12222.73s -> 12233.53s]  Being tiny.
[12233.53s -> 12236.86s]  I got that.
[12236.86s -> 12239.74s]  I have to go open the other side?
[12239.74s -> 12249.72s]  How do I get on the other side? How do I get over there?
[12249.72s -> 12258.41s]  How do I get over there?
[12258.41s -> 12261.61s]  How do I get over there? What the fuck?
[12261.61s -> 12263.61s]  Alright, I'm done. I'll see you guys
[12263.61s -> 12265.91s]  in like a week.
[12265.91s -> 12267.91s]  I'm going to get the fuck out of here. Fucking stupid.
[12267.91s -> 12290.68s]  How do I get over there?
[12290.68s -> 12293.30s]  Unlock this side?
[12306.73s -> 12309.42s]  Okay.
[12309.42s -> 12323.18s]  I can't go in the other side.
[12323.18s -> 12327.72s]  I can't go in this side.
[12327.72s -> 12330.28s]  I can only walk in there.
[12330.28s -> 12343.91s]  Brain, ha ha ha.
[12343.91s -> 12364.50s]  Up on the right.
[12364.50s -> 12366.87s]  Come on, I'll get it.
[12366.87s -> 12368.87s]  My nose is so itchy. It bugs all of my eyes.
[12368.87s -> 12395.80s]  It bugs all of me.
[12395.80s -> 12397.80s]  Shit. I had it too.
[12397.80s -> 12434.46s]  Alright, it's done.
[12434.46s -> 12438.81s]  It's fleas.
[12438.81s -> 12457.11s]  Not fucking fleas, folks.
[12457.11s -> 12459.42s]  Right in the AC.
[12459.42s -> 12466.46s]  I've been streaming for three and a half hours?
[12466.46s -> 12471.43s]  Really?
[12471.43s -> 12477.62s]  Any medallion?
[12477.62s -> 12488.95s]  What's with this box?
[12488.95s -> 12514.62s]  I can't go up or down with this.
[12514.62s -> 12541.56s]  I can't drag it down.
[12541.56s -> 12545.58s]  Play Left 4 Dead 2 for a minute.
[12545.58s -> 12553.64s]  Probe! Oh, this is going to be hell.
[12553.64s -> 12556.58s]  I know I'm not going to do very well on this.
[12556.58s -> 12609.38s]  I think this is going to be horrible.
[12609.38s -> 12612.07s]  Slug Pug.
[12612.07s -> 12614.82s]  Should I delete? Where are you?
[12614.82s -> 12618.41s]  Should I delete Slug Pug?
[12618.41s -> 12620.41s]  I added it for like an hour one day and I just was like,
[12620.41s -> 12623.10s]  you know what? Fuck it. I'm going to get rid of it.
[12623.10s -> 12631.93s]  Should I get rid of Slug Pug or no?
[12631.93s -> 12636.22s]  That's medallion number two?
[12636.22s -> 12642.79s]  Yeah, fucking kill it.
[12642.79s -> 12645.54s]  Please do. It sucks.
[12645.54s -> 12647.54s]  I can't even see it. This isn't a VTTV.
[12647.54s -> 12661.16s]  Probably one more.
[12661.16s -> 12678.04s]  I don't. I don't like this one.
[12678.04s -> 12680.04s]  This is the Impossible Staircase thing.
[12680.04s -> 12689.53s]  I'm getting Super Monkey Ball flashbacks right now.
[12689.53s -> 12692.60s]  I feel like I'm playing Monkey Ball.
[12692.60s -> 12697.78s]  It's freaking me out.
[12697.78s -> 12699.78s]  I've got to turn this all over.
[12699.78s -> 12711.35s]  How do I even manipulate this?
[12711.35s -> 12713.35s]  Probably all screaming right now.
[12713.35s -> 12715.35s]  Like, dude, just pull the fucking rope, dude.
[12715.35s -> 12725.38s]  Good. Come in.
[12725.38s -> 12736.95s]  That's one of them.
[12736.95s -> 12760.74s]  I'm going to get the second one.
[12760.74s -> 12763.05s]  Yo, Jerma, that's a nice ass you got there.
[12763.05s -> 12766.89s]  It's supposed to just like,
[12766.89s -> 12776.49s]  fake comment.
[12776.49s -> 12780.01s]  Alright, so in here,
[12780.01s -> 12788.14s]  where's the second one? Up there.
[12788.14s -> 12791.53s]  We're going to go up the stairs.
[12791.53s -> 12794.73s]  Here we go. We've got to end up here.
[12794.73s -> 12796.73s]  That's where we have to end up.
[12796.73s -> 12798.73s]  We're going to go that way, around,
[12798.73s -> 12802.63s]  that way, that way, across.
[12802.63s -> 12805.83s]  Oh, we go over here,
[12805.83s -> 12807.83s]  through there. We go up these stairs.
[12807.83s -> 12809.83s]  We go around. He's got it.
[12809.83s -> 12811.83s]  Bingo. Let's end this place.
[12811.83s -> 12822.39s]  Let's go, skip to the top.
[12822.39s -> 12837.54s]  Told you I was going to get it.
[12837.54s -> 12841.70s]  That would be number three.
[12841.70s -> 12843.70s]  Stream is making me feel like I drank too much Nyquil.
[12843.70s -> 12854.14s]  Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[12854.14s -> 12856.14s]  Is that an off-handed,
[12856.14s -> 12858.14s]  boring stream comment?
[12858.14s -> 12860.14s]  That was pretty good.
[12860.14s -> 12862.63s]  If so, that was pretty clever.
[12862.63s -> 12868.20s]  I'm having fun
[12868.20s -> 12870.20s]  in my puzzle game, okay?
[12870.20s -> 12874.04s]  Under the stars of Taurus,
[12874.04s -> 12876.04s]  the boomer fell.
[12876.04s -> 12878.04s]  The Templars lay defeated, yet the cargo
[12878.04s -> 12882.58s]  was saved. Why does everyone
[12882.58s -> 12885.08s]  love me?
[12885.08s -> 12887.08s]  You're talking about me.
[12887.08s -> 12891.05s]  End of this. This is fun. Yeah, it's fun.
[12891.05s -> 12893.67s]  I've been looking forward to this game.
[12893.67s -> 12901.72s]  Yo, chubby bunny.
[12901.72s -> 12906.84s]  How fast do you think I can move?
[12906.84s -> 12908.84s]  Under the stairs of Taurus,
[12908.84s -> 12911.78s]  the banner fell.
[12911.78s -> 12913.78s]  Templars lay defeated, yet the cargo was saved.
[12913.78s -> 12915.78s]  Under the stars of Taurus, the banner did
[12915.78s -> 12918.54s]  fall.
[12929.40s -> 12931.40s]  Under the stars of Taurus,
[12931.40s -> 12933.77s]  the banner did fall.
[12933.77s -> 12935.77s]  Now, here's the question.
[12935.77s -> 12937.77s]  I know that that's
[12937.77s -> 12940.07s]  Gemini.
[12940.07s -> 12945.56s]  I don't know if that is Taurus.
[12945.56s -> 12947.56s]  That's Taurus, right? No, that's the goat.
[12947.56s -> 12949.56s]  What's the goat? The ram?
[12949.56s -> 12951.56s]  Ares. Ares the ram.
[12955.83s -> 12957.83s]  Binding of Isaac. That's the one that
[12957.83s -> 12959.83s]  destroys the whole room when you use it.
[12959.83s -> 12964.55s]  Bacon. Bacon.
[12964.55s -> 12968.52s]  Pisces is the fish.
[12968.52s -> 12970.52s]  Question mark. What's the Taurus?
[12970.52s -> 12973.40s]  Taurus is the horn. Taurus is the horns.
[12973.40s -> 12975.40s]  That's not the goat. That's not the goat.
[12975.40s -> 12977.40s]  The sheep, whatever it is. Ares the goat.
[12977.40s -> 12981.67s]  One with the horns.
[12981.67s -> 12986.66s]  Taurus is under one. What are the two M's?
[12986.66s -> 12992.74s]  Taurus is ten.
[12992.74s -> 12994.74s]  Okay, so we gotta get ten.
[12994.74s -> 12999.16s]  We gotta get this ten o'clock.
[12999.16s -> 13013.62s]  What about doing these medallions?
[13013.62s -> 13017.96s]  I know.
[13017.96s -> 13019.96s]  I know where they go, right over here.
[13019.96s -> 13034.79s]  On screen? Yeah, man.
[13034.79s -> 13038.70s]  Look, we've been doing all kinds of
[13038.70s -> 13040.70s]  crazy shit in VR. I wanna do a puzzle game.
[13040.70s -> 13053.35s]  Where do these go?
[13053.35s -> 13069.08s]  Look at this. Slug storm.
[13069.08s -> 13073.05s]  They're on coke.
[13073.05s -> 13075.54s]  I am not on
[13075.54s -> 13077.54s]  coke. I am sorry to do.
[13077.54s -> 13079.54s]  I guess like, uh, that unfortunately
[13079.54s -> 13081.54s]  for you, I don't know what.
[13081.54s -> 13083.91s]  You want me to be on coke?
[13083.91s -> 13105.59s]  Ooh, how about you just relax?
[13105.59s -> 13110.97s]  If we're gonna do some working
[13110.97s -> 13112.97s]  practice, we can find a way to fix it. Of course it's not working.
[13112.97s -> 13115.14s]  Hammer? I have a hammer.
[13115.14s -> 13124.66s]  Copper? Wait, we gotta
[13124.66s -> 13130.04s]  go upstairs now.
[13130.04s -> 13132.04s]  Remember I told you that we needed
[13132.04s -> 13134.34s]  that shit? Big thing
[13134.34s -> 13137.54s]  that was upstairs.
[13137.54s -> 13153.91s]  What was that though? What actually?
[13153.91s -> 13167.99s]  More fun than Skyrim.
[13167.99s -> 13169.99s]  There are clumps of hair
[13169.99s -> 13172.42s]  falling out.
[13172.42s -> 13174.42s]  Imagine that turn.
[13174.42s -> 13176.42s]  It looks like a big fucking clump of hair
[13176.42s -> 13178.42s]  just falls. I turn over here.
[13178.42s -> 13180.42s]  Huge clump of hair.
[13180.42s -> 13182.66s]  I'm just bald in fucking five
[13182.66s -> 13185.10s]  places.
[13185.10s -> 13187.40s]  I will tell you this though.
[13187.40s -> 13189.40s]  Do not fuck around in VR for this long
[13189.40s -> 13191.40s]  because man, your hair is
[13191.40s -> 13193.40s]  changed for a year.
[13193.40s -> 13195.40s]  You wanna know why I do all the
[13195.40s -> 13197.40s]  VR streams in a row?
[13197.40s -> 13199.40s]  And we don't take any breaks?
[13199.40s -> 13201.40s]  And it's like five, six, or seven
[13201.40s -> 13203.40s]  VR streams in a row? Because this shit goes back
[13203.40s -> 13205.40s]  in the closet because my hair
[13205.40s -> 13207.40s]  is ruined for like two years.
[13207.40s -> 13209.40s]  Until new hair
[13209.40s -> 13216.44s]  grows back, it's ruined.
[13216.44s -> 13221.50s]  Mallet, I got the mallet.
[13221.50s -> 13223.50s]  Hey, Templar, I fell in a fierce battle. The horror was
[13223.50s -> 13225.50s]  laid bare by the light of a full moon.
[13225.50s -> 13230.79s]  Alright, is that like
[13230.79s -> 13232.79s]  Uncle Fester machine that you hold
[13232.79s -> 13234.79s]  and it just vibrates your hands?
[13234.79s -> 13237.03s]  By the way, I can
[13237.03s -> 13239.03s]  do that shit on the highest setting and not let
[13239.03s -> 13243.90s]  go. I actually did it recently.
[13243.90s -> 13246.71s]  The thing that just goes
[13248.71s -> 13250.71s]  and the thing laughs at you, I held it the entire
[13250.71s -> 13255.00s]  time. You want? Ask
[13255.00s -> 13257.69s]  R.T. Gamecrub. He was literally
[13257.69s -> 13259.69s]  in the room. Literally in the room
[13259.69s -> 13261.69s]  while I'm sitting there just going, yeah,
[13261.69s -> 13263.69s]  this don't even fucking hurt. And they all
[13263.69s -> 13265.69s]  called me a psycho. Everybody was like, you're a psycho.
[13265.69s -> 13267.69s]  You're a fucking weirdo. And I'm
[13267.69s -> 13273.11s]  just like, good. Play
[13273.11s -> 13275.11s]  Jump King. Alright, actually time that person out
[13275.11s -> 13281.38s]  for five minutes. You are a weirdo.
[13281.38s -> 13283.38s]  I'm not, why am I such a weirdo?
[13283.38s -> 13291.88s]  Alright, let's go. Alright, because I
[13291.88s -> 13293.88s]  can do the Uncle Fester machine thing?
[13293.88s -> 13302.01s]  Old people use that machine.
[13302.01s -> 13304.01s]  Guys, okay.
[13304.01s -> 13306.95s]  You try it. You try it on easy when you see it
[13306.95s -> 13311.62s]  next time. Next time you see that machine,
[13311.62s -> 13313.62s]  I want you to do it on easy and then I want you to go,
[13313.62s -> 13315.86s]  oh my god, Jerma's
[13315.86s -> 13317.86s]  so much stronger than I am. That machine
[13317.86s -> 13327.21s]  fucking scared me.
[13327.21s -> 13334.70s]  Oh wow. Boom!
[13334.70s -> 13348.50s]  What do I do? Am I looking at this shit
[13348.50s -> 13351.70s]  here? Am I paying attention to the banners?
[13351.70s -> 13355.16s]  Oh, it was under the banner.
[13355.16s -> 13357.16s]  It did fall. Under
[13357.16s -> 13359.46s]  Taurus it called.
[13359.46s -> 13361.46s]  Under Taurus it did
[13361.46s -> 13363.46s]  call the banner that would show them all.
[13363.46s -> 13365.46s]  Right? Whatever it is, the one banner
[13365.46s -> 13367.46s]  to rule them all, Taurus is here
[13367.46s -> 13369.46s]  to stall.
[13369.46s -> 13373.99s]  This one? That one.
[13373.99s -> 13381.54s]  Pumps of hair. You know what?
[13381.54s -> 13383.54s]  Ah, quiet.
[13383.54s -> 13385.54s]  I want you to, alright, the next like, I'm gonna
[13385.54s -> 13387.54s]  I mean tomorrow we're doing VR but I don't know if I can
[13387.54s -> 13389.54s]  do it by then. I'm gonna get like a bunch of
[13389.54s -> 13391.54s]  fucking hair, like just like a wig and cut a bunch
[13391.54s -> 13393.54s]  of hair out of the wig.
[13393.54s -> 13395.54s]  Like the Halloween store and like
[13395.54s -> 13397.54s]  get it in here and like have it be coming out
[13397.54s -> 13402.28s]  and shit on stream. I don't
[13402.28s -> 13404.28s]  know what this even means but apparently it's like under
[13404.28s -> 13409.14s]  one of these banners. But I don't know
[13409.14s -> 13419.58s]  what that mean.
[13419.58s -> 13421.58s]  Somebody will get a good screenshot.
[13421.58s -> 13423.58s]  Upside down, okay. I know what to do.
[13423.58s -> 13426.46s]  Let's go. Banner that it would fall
[13426.46s -> 13429.85s]  or whatever. That was important.
[13429.85s -> 13440.86s]  Although we don't have a disc or anything over there.
[13440.86s -> 13443.67s]  There's no disc.
[13443.67s -> 13446.23s]  Bugpug. Full stream.
[13446.23s -> 13456.73s]  And this is gonna put me in trouble. Cog
[13456.73s -> 13463.13s]  goes where? Nice.
[13463.13s -> 13466.20s]  Gonna have a huge indent on my
[13466.20s -> 13470.42s]  face. It hurts. Oh, okay.
[13470.42s -> 13472.66s]  Taurus at ten o'clock.
[13472.66s -> 13476.50s]  It did fall.
[13476.50s -> 13479.96s]  And ten o'clock
[13479.96s -> 13481.96s]  to save us all.
[13481.96s -> 13484.84s]  Or something. Whatever.
[13484.84s -> 13493.22s]  No, it was eleven o'clock.
[13493.22s -> 13495.46s]  And it was a full moon.
[13495.46s -> 13498.15s]  Full moon.
[13498.15s -> 13500.15s]  Taurus at ten.
[13500.15s -> 13524.58s]  Oh, I gotta... What does that do, man?
[13524.58s -> 13540.46s]  Let me get a close up
[13540.46s -> 13542.46s]  view of this.
[13542.46s -> 13545.85s]  That's... Okay.
[13545.85s -> 13549.80s]  Oh, don't know where that
[13549.80s -> 13552.42s]  goes. Oh, auto check. Auto.
[13552.42s -> 13563.75s]  Right.
[13563.75s -> 13573.59s]  Look at the other one. That's not gonna bounce.
[13573.59s -> 13575.83s]  Bounce off that
[13575.83s -> 13580.18s]  one. I don't have that one.
[13580.18s -> 13584.22s]  Oh, the piano.
[13584.22s -> 13586.78s]  The organ.
[13586.78s -> 13600.90s]  The organ.
[13600.90s -> 13606.60s]  Oh, okay. Here we go.
[13606.60s -> 13610.63s]  So why is it so dark in here?
[13610.63s -> 13615.69s]  Hold on. It's dark as hell in here.
[13615.69s -> 13617.69s]  You guys get out. I'm just a silhouette in the
[13617.69s -> 13640.26s]  room. Better.
[13640.26s -> 13642.26s]  Wait. That's the question.
[13642.26s -> 13644.57s]  Wait, wait, wait. What is this?
[13644.57s -> 13646.57s]  Germa, frankly, I...
[13646.57s -> 13648.57s]  Germa, frankly, I find your avoidance of an answer to the
[13648.57s -> 13650.57s]  question of slug poggins problematic.
[13650.57s -> 13652.57s]  I've been an avid viewer of the channel for fifteen years
[13652.57s -> 13654.57s]  and as such I can clearly see the great value of slug
[13654.57s -> 13656.57s]  pog is brought to this channel. Please don't
[13656.57s -> 13658.57s]  kill the slug pog. It holds us together. It's a sticky
[13658.57s -> 13660.57s]  slug slime. It's being removed at the end
[13660.57s -> 13662.57s]  of the stream. Like, I'm just gonna get rid of it. It's ugly.
[13662.57s -> 13665.70s]  And it annoys everybody.
[13665.70s -> 13667.70s]  It's being removed in about
[13667.70s -> 13671.86s]  thirty to forty minutes.
[13671.86s -> 13676.47s]  Or is it? Stay tuned. Find out. Or is it?
[13676.47s -> 13689.83s]  Find out. I'm so scared to take
[13689.83s -> 13693.93s]  this headband off. I really am.
[13693.93s -> 13697.64s]  I'm scared that I'm gonna take this off
[13697.64s -> 13699.64s]  and there's not gonna be anything underneath
[13699.64s -> 13733.42s]  her. Oh!
[13733.42s -> 13735.42s]  You know in the movie
[13735.42s -> 13737.42s]  where the guy puts his hand on the
[13737.42s -> 13739.42s]  ball in the class?
[13739.42s -> 13742.94s]  In the science class?
[13742.94s -> 13744.94s]  It's not even a movie. It's just in class.
[13744.94s -> 13747.69s]  That's not
[13747.69s -> 13749.69s]  coming back for a while.
[13749.69s -> 13759.80s]  I'm in a lot of trouble now.
[13759.80s -> 13762.30s]  Oh my
[13762.30s -> 13764.30s]  fucking
[13764.30s -> 13766.30s]  God!
[13766.30s -> 13780.63s]  Oh!
[13780.63s -> 13792.98s]  Ray man!
[13792.98s -> 13794.98s]  It looks like it hurts. And it does.
[13794.98s -> 13796.98s]  Trust me when I say it fucking hurts.
[13796.98s -> 13798.98s]  You can't do VR. It's not possible.
[13798.98s -> 13800.98s]  This is why it's never gonna take off.
[13800.98s -> 13802.98s]  One point eight percent of people on
[13802.98s -> 13804.98s]  Steam have VR.
[13804.98s -> 13807.78s]  Do you want this to happen to you?
[13807.78s -> 13809.78s]  No you don't. You don't want to look like this.
[13809.78s -> 13813.11s]  You don't want to like
[13813.11s -> 13815.11s]  lose the top fucking part of your
[13815.11s -> 13825.16s]  hair? You're using the five
[13825.16s -> 13827.16s]  year old outdated
[13827.16s -> 13829.16s]  I can't even take myself seriously.
[13829.16s -> 13835.18s]  You can see the scalp.
[13835.18s -> 13837.18s]  I've ruined my fucking
[13837.18s -> 13839.18s]  head. This is gonna take
[13839.18s -> 13841.18s]  years for this to come back normally.
[13841.18s -> 13843.18s]  This is gonna take a decade. And by
[13843.18s -> 13845.18s]  a decade by the way I'll be 45
[13845.18s -> 13847.18s]  and it'll just be gone anyways.
[13847.18s -> 13855.69s]  Brush it? No! I'm not
[13855.69s -> 13859.78s]  brushing it. I'm not brushing it.
[13859.78s -> 13861.78s]  I'm gonna go in the bath and I'm gonna hold my head underwater
[13861.78s -> 13869.21s]  and put a conditioner in my hair. This is a
[13869.21s -> 13872.79s]  chaotic stream.
[13872.79s -> 13874.79s]  Okay, ready?
[13874.79s -> 13892.63s]  Would you swipe right?
[13892.63s -> 13894.63s]  That's the
[13894.63s -> 13896.94s]  guy that you accidentally super like.
[13896.94s -> 13898.94s]  And you go
[13898.94s -> 13902.14s]  Oh fuck.
[13902.14s -> 13905.45s]  Are you super like
[13905.45s -> 13907.45s]  me? What was it?
[13907.45s -> 13909.45s]  You like me a lot apparently.
[13909.45s -> 13911.45s]  Do you like to go on a date?
[13911.45s -> 13922.07s]  No, Rayman.
[13922.07s -> 13924.07s]  Rayman was the best.
[13924.07s -> 13926.07s]  Rayman is the best description.
[13926.07s -> 13928.50s]  I really like this
[13928.50s -> 13930.50s]  view. I feel
[13930.50s -> 13932.50s]  pretty confident right now.
[13932.50s -> 13934.74s]  Remember me? German985.
[13934.74s -> 13936.74s]  Good to meet you.
[13936.74s -> 13938.74s]  That's me. Welcome to the stream.
[13938.74s -> 13941.18s]  I'm pretty handsome. I'm a pretty handsome guy.
[13941.18s -> 13947.62s]  Don't you think?
[13947.62s -> 13949.62s]  I made it
[13949.62s -> 13953.21s]  worse. It's dead.
[13953.21s -> 13955.21s]  It's actually all dead hair.
[13955.21s -> 13959.11s]  It's a bird's nest. Let the
[13959.11s -> 13965.19s]  light hit it. Somebody fucking electrocuted
[13965.19s -> 13969.99s]  me. Take the shirt off.
[13969.99s -> 13975.75s]  Like that'll help.
[13975.75s -> 13977.75s]  I don't even want to touch it. It's gonna all fall off.
[13977.75s -> 13988.76s]  Imagine if I actually
[13988.76s -> 13998.17s]  pulled a clump.
[13998.17s -> 14000.17s]  Upside down. Hey, show feet.
[14000.17s -> 14004.14s]  Is that really what you're asking
[14004.14s -> 14006.14s]  right now? After this?
[14006.14s -> 14020.15s]  That's what you're asking.
[14020.15s -> 14022.15s]  I gotta cut it all off.
[14022.15s -> 14036.09s]  In VR.
[14036.09s -> 14043.64s]  Alright, let's get in here and do the organ.
[14043.64s -> 14047.16s]  You gonna do the castanza?
[14047.16s -> 14049.16s]  I thought the headband was gonna help. The headband
[14049.16s -> 14058.89s]  might have actually made it worse.
[14058.89s -> 14066.57s]  Get down. Your hair is fine.
[14066.57s -> 14084.09s]  Let's go.
[14084.09s -> 14086.26s]  Where the heck am I?
[14086.26s -> 14088.70s]  Where the heck am I? I can't see anything.
[14088.70s -> 14090.70s]  This is fucking really immersive.
[14092.70s -> 14094.70s]  Today I hit the fucking thing.
[14094.70s -> 14096.70s]  It didn't even work. I was trying to...
[14096.70s -> 14099.58s]  Are those glued to the wall?
[14099.58s -> 14114.10s]  It's been baby-proofed.
[14114.10s -> 14117.69s]  What the hell are we doing before I
[14117.69s -> 14119.69s]  panicked about my appearance?
[14119.69s -> 14121.69s]  Like how my hair is gone?
[14121.69s -> 14123.99s]  I'm gonna leave conditioner in my hair.
[14123.99s -> 14125.99s]  I'm going to play Half-Life Alex tomorrow.
[14125.99s -> 14128.94s]  I'll be lucky if there's anything left.
[14128.94s -> 14142.50s]  Bald. Bald. Wear a wig.
[14142.50s -> 14144.81s]  Why not try a beanie?
[14144.81s -> 14146.81s]  I tried a beanie before and my head was sweating
[14146.81s -> 14148.81s]  so much that I got
[14148.81s -> 14150.81s]  zits all over my forehead.
[14150.81s -> 14153.05s]  All over my face.
[14153.05s -> 14155.86s]  I had zits in my hair.
[14155.86s -> 14157.86s]  I remember being like, ow, fucking
[14157.86s -> 14160.87s]  zits.
[14160.87s -> 14162.87s]  VR sucks.
[14162.87s -> 14168.31s]  Okay?
[14168.31s -> 14170.31s]  It's just do a cool thing
[14170.31s -> 14178.06s]  and torture yourself.
[14178.06s -> 14180.06s]  VR fucking sucks.
[14180.06s -> 14183.26s]  It's so cool.
[14183.26s -> 14185.88s]  It's so much fun.
[14185.88s -> 14187.88s]  But holy shit, you lose like
[14187.88s -> 14189.88s]  three months of your life every time you play it.
[14189.88s -> 14192.89s]  Alright, let's do this.
[14192.89s -> 14198.90s]  Oh, up the stairs, right? Yeah.
[14198.90s -> 14203.70s]  How do we get back up there? Anybody
[14203.70s -> 14210.60s]  remember?
[14210.60s -> 14214.06s]  Okay. Popper?
[14214.06s -> 14217.32s]  Thank you. Popper? Thank you.
[14217.32s -> 14239.96s]  Oh. Oh, nice.
[14239.96s -> 14257.22s]  Oh. Oh, shit.
[14257.22s -> 14268.73s]  I think it is.
[14268.73s -> 14270.73s]  What the heck?
[14270.73s -> 14286.58s]  Bull.
[14286.58s -> 14290.36s]  How do I get over there? Bice is over there. How do I get over there?
[14290.36s -> 14300.46s]  Okay. Um.
[14300.46s -> 14313.75s]  Do I get out? Bro, what the heck?
[14313.75s -> 14338.12s]  I don't know what I just did. Wait a minute.
[14338.12s -> 14344.14s]  The hell did I just do? What is this doing?
[14344.14s -> 14350.90s]  Whoa. What's going on over there?
[14350.90s -> 14368.74s]  Uh.
[14368.74s -> 14373.59s]  Hat. Hat with a hat?
[14373.59s -> 14381.83s]  What are you talking about? Rat Pog. Rat Pog.
[14381.83s -> 14383.83s]  Did all of them just face the same direction like that?
[14383.83s -> 14386.14s]  Yeah, did they just face the same
[14386.14s -> 14388.82s]  direction like that? Rat in the hat.
[14388.82s -> 14403.61s]  Where's the rat in the hat?
[14403.61s -> 14408.79s]  Do you not see the rat in the hat?
[14408.79s -> 14416.09s]  Oh, dude. What are you guys talking about?
[14416.09s -> 14418.09s]  Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Hold on.
[14418.09s -> 14429.78s]  That's where I'm standing, right?
[14429.78s -> 14435.14s]  Um. Did I get one that can
[14435.14s -> 14454.20s]  turn? I have no idea.
[14454.20s -> 14459.75s]  I don't know. At behind you.
[14459.75s -> 14466.98s]  I think Xanax feels like
[14466.98s -> 14468.98s]  the game audio is muted?
[14468.98s -> 14475.96s]  No, it's not.
[14475.96s -> 14479.74s]  Wait. Like that?
[14479.74s -> 14481.74s]  That's not right. This is not right.
[14481.74s -> 14486.22s]  I don't know. We're going back in.
[14486.22s -> 14500.41s]  What am I doing? Oh, that's the shell.
[14500.41s -> 14517.22s]  Ooh. Holy shit.
[14517.22s -> 14519.22s]  Okay, cool. I got it. I figured it out.
[14519.22s -> 14521.22s]  No, I didn't. Fuck. It's gotta be a shorter one.
[14521.22s -> 14523.22s]  Okay. It's gotta be a short
[14523.22s -> 14525.46s]  one. This one is correct.
[14525.46s -> 14528.47s]  Kind of. So it's this
[14528.47s -> 14530.47s]  whatever one is right here, that's correct.
[14530.47s -> 14532.47s]  But that one isn't. It's gotta be this one
[14532.47s -> 14539.06s]  there. Let's go.
[14539.06s -> 14543.48s]  Oh, that's correct.
[14543.48s -> 14545.98s]  Another one of those. That one right
[14545.98s -> 14550.14s]  there. Put that one right there.
[14550.14s -> 14553.38s]  How about that one?
[14553.38s -> 14563.11s]  How about that one, folks?
[14563.11s -> 14594.09s]  That was wrong. Poor hair.
[14594.09s -> 14598.89s]  I'm so sad about it.
[14598.89s -> 14608.62s]  Why is this... I can't...
[14608.62s -> 14639.70s]  Why can I not spin it anymore?
[14639.70s -> 14651.14s]  Exit right there.
[14651.14s -> 14656.39s]  Exit right there? I can't...
[14656.39s -> 14673.35s]  I don't know. I'm there.
[14673.35s -> 14681.53s]  I need a lip. Is there an even shorter one?
[14681.53s -> 14713.58s]  Wait, is that not it? Open it!
[14713.58s -> 14715.58s]  Spin them back around. Yeah, I
[14715.58s -> 14719.42s]  can't. I can't touch the wheel.
[14719.42s -> 14727.86s]  Walked in place. It's probably just one of these
[14727.86s -> 14730.62s]  weird ones here. But I got an idea.
[14730.62s -> 14746.07s]  That one. That'd be this one here.
[14746.07s -> 14763.40s]  Hey, any of these?
[14763.40s -> 14791.42s]  It's none of them! It's none of them!
[14791.42s -> 14839.86s]  The wreck pipe is missing? Whose pipe
[14839.86s -> 14866.73s]  over here? Give me it.
[14866.73s -> 14873.50s]  How do I get it? Give me the pipe.
[14873.50s -> 14886.81s]  Give me that pipe. Hey, please.
[14886.81s -> 14888.81s]  Come on, this is starting to run a little thin.
[14888.81s -> 14890.81s]  Also, already...
[14890.81s -> 14893.24s]  Your other left?
[14893.24s -> 14912.81s]  Okay. This is...
[14912.81s -> 14914.81s]  If I'm looking at it like this is the right
[14914.81s -> 14916.81s]  side...
[14916.81s -> 14921.99s]  Dude, this is starting to get a little
[14921.99s -> 14926.79s]  thin.
[14926.79s -> 14928.79s]  Which one? Where is it?
[14928.79s -> 14936.22s]  That one here? Or is it one more?
[14936.22s -> 14944.02s]  Hey, dude, German, this is like
[14944.02s -> 14946.02s]  starting to get a little thin.
[14946.02s -> 14952.23s]  God damn it.
[14952.23s -> 14962.39s]  Give me this.
[14962.39s -> 14964.39s]  You know, this joke is kind of
[14964.39s -> 14966.39s]  running a little thin.
[14966.39s -> 14971.45s]  Okay. Very cool.
[14971.45s -> 14973.45s]  Very fun. Awesome.
[14973.45s -> 14975.45s]  Sick.
[14975.45s -> 14980.12s]  It's done. Stop saying that, please.
[14980.12s -> 15019.21s]  What the fuck did you say?
[15019.21s -> 15026.38s]  Nice. That's so cool.
[15026.38s -> 15028.38s]  Well, that's the bellows, and then this is another bellows.
[15028.38s -> 15030.38s]  The two bellows, and that should turn it back
[15030.38s -> 15038.25s]  on.
[15038.25s -> 15052.06s]  Play the piano.
[15052.06s -> 15054.06s]  He said it. He finally said it.
[15054.06s -> 15056.23s]  He did it.
[15056.23s -> 15058.23s]  He finally said the thing.
[15058.23s -> 15060.79s]  Said Munkah S.
[15060.79s -> 15068.52s]  Is this a dumb thing?
[15068.52s -> 15075.94s]  Play it. Piano time.
[15075.94s -> 15114.65s]  Come to my opera.
[15114.65s -> 15153.16s]  Wait, wait, wait! There's not enough keys!
[15153.16s -> 15176.84s]  I can't play it.
[15176.84s -> 15178.84s]  Hey, hey! Remember this one, guys?
[15178.84s -> 15182.15s]  Summer lovin'.
[15182.15s -> 15184.71s]  Had me a blast.
[15184.71s -> 15187.66s]  Summer lovin'.
[15187.66s -> 15189.83s]  Happened so fast.
[15189.83s -> 15191.83s]  I met a girl. Cutest could be.
[15191.83s -> 15195.53s]  Met a fo-
[15195.53s -> 15198.09s]  Cutest could be.
[15198.09s -> 15217.59s]  Summer!
[15217.59s -> 15227.96s]  Fucking hate it. Okay, let's go.
[15227.96s -> 15239.10s]  Look at this shit.
[15239.10s -> 15241.10s]  This is a really, really weird way to teach you how to
[15241.10s -> 15248.58s]  play the piano. Oh, I lost the ball.
[15248.58s -> 15260.54s]  Hey, wait, wait, wait! Okay, now
[15260.54s -> 15267.56s]  it's gotta go down there. Shit!
[15267.56s -> 15269.56s]  This is fucking hard. Okay, I need one
[15269.56s -> 15303.42s]  hand. It's fucking high!
[15303.42s -> 15305.42s]  The black keys?
[15305.42s -> 15323.66s]  What? Oh, shit.
[15323.66s -> 15343.88s]  Get this off. Get it off the screen.
[15343.88s -> 15361.21s]  I have a new ball. Alright, it's gotta
[15361.21s -> 15364.66s]  go down. I need it to line up
[15364.66s -> 15375.99s]  right. No, fuck! I didn't wanna do that.
[15375.99s -> 15392.89s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
[15392.89s -> 15397.62s]  I wanna see at least one
[15397.62s -> 15399.93s]  pogchamp. I need- I want at least one
[15399.93s -> 15407.03s]  pogchamp for that one. One more. All the way
[15407.03s -> 15439.66s]  over here. Hey, hold on.
[15439.66s -> 15445.22s]  That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it!
[15445.22s -> 15447.22s]  What do you guys have to say about that?
[15447.22s -> 15452.73s]  Ooh, we can't do it.
[15452.73s -> 15455.35s]  That shit. I'll take it and
[15455.35s -> 15457.35s]  that's the completion of that fucking room right there,
[15457.35s -> 15465.85s]  folks. Here we go.
[15465.85s -> 15467.85s]  Now we just gotta line that up. That's red,
[15467.85s -> 15469.85s]  blue, and green.
[15469.85s -> 15482.52s]  Funko viewers? What?
[15482.52s -> 15485.72s]  The Funko
[15485.72s -> 15488.09s]  viewers. Okay, red, blue, and
[15488.09s -> 15495.51s]  green. Here we go.
[15495.51s -> 15497.88s]  Red, blue, and green. Oh.
[15497.88s -> 15499.88s]  Red, blue, and green.
[15499.88s -> 15505.90s]  Red, blue, and green.
[15505.90s -> 15507.90s]  Red, blue, and green.
[15507.90s -> 15511.80s]  How about Abadoo
[15511.80s -> 15523.83s]  right there, I think.
[15523.83s -> 15534.14s]  Red, blue, and green.
[15534.14s -> 15537.96s]  Green. Green.
[15537.96s -> 15559.51s]  What's wrong with it?
[15559.51s -> 15566.34s]  What's wrong with it?
[15566.34s -> 15568.34s]  Hey, this looks super cool. This is
[15568.34s -> 15577.50s]  this is
[15577.50s -> 15579.99s]  for my fucking loyal viewers,
[15579.99s -> 15581.99s]  this is the Room
[15581.99s -> 15584.36s]  VR. Now,
[15584.36s -> 15586.36s]  the Room VR is an offshoot
[15586.36s -> 15588.36s]  of the Room the Video
[15588.36s -> 15590.36s]  Game series. The series of
[15590.36s -> 15592.36s]  puzzle boxes. One of
[15592.36s -> 15594.36s]  the most fun iPad games
[15594.36s -> 15596.36s]  that they ported to Steam. I know you
[15596.36s -> 15598.36s]  know that. You're my guy.
[15598.36s -> 15602.78s]  Check it out. This is called the Room.
[15602.78s -> 15607.38s]  It's on Steam. I don't know
[15607.38s -> 15609.38s]  okay, I was just gonna throw this against the wall
[15609.38s -> 15611.38s]  and this thing's like, this thing's worth like
[15611.38s -> 15615.35s]  fucking 60 bucks. Does it have like a
[15615.35s -> 15618.17s]  price tag on it?
[15618.17s -> 15636.26s]  That was tricky. It paid
[15636.26s -> 15638.26s]  $50, but it's worth $40.
[15638.26s -> 15641.91s]  Okay, so how's this wrong?
[15641.91s -> 15644.22s]  That looks real, that looks correct.
[15644.22s -> 15647.10s]  Am I, if she was shining
[15647.10s -> 15650.42s]  at the wrong person? That looks
[15650.42s -> 15656.25s]  right to me.
[15656.25s -> 15665.85s]  What's the deal? I just did that.
[15665.85s -> 15669.94s]  Alright, now we're gonna do one more. This one is
[15669.94s -> 15681.64s]  in there, what? Upside down.
[15681.64s -> 15694.74s]  And red. And then we got
[15694.74s -> 15696.74s]  a little bit of
[15696.74s -> 15703.96s]  and red. Dine it.
[15703.96s -> 15720.97s]  Oh, it's burning the shield.
[15720.97s -> 15722.97s]  Rat in the hat chat. There's no rat in the hat.
[15722.97s -> 15746.25s]  Aha.
[15746.25s -> 15751.75s]  Fuck does this mean? All gonna be facing the same
[15751.75s -> 15754.12s]  direction kind of? Okay.
[15754.12s -> 15765.69s]  It's gotta be, did I fuck it up already?
[15765.69s -> 15791.19s]  Bingo. That's it.
[15791.19s -> 15796.31s]  Okay, now, oh shit.
[15796.31s -> 15798.31s]  Is this listed somewhere?
[15798.31s -> 15800.81s]  Do we have a list of this somewhere?
[15800.81s -> 15803.56s]  Yeah, okay.
[15803.56s -> 15805.56s]  Top right is hourglass.
[15805.56s -> 15812.66s]  Right there is
[15812.66s -> 15815.40s]  uh, pizza.
[15815.40s -> 15818.65s]  Already there. Then we got
[15818.65s -> 15823.13s]  a blade. It's already there.
[15823.13s -> 15833.74s]  And then we got, then we got
[15833.74s -> 15841.59s]  infinity. Finally,
[15841.59s -> 15852.39s]  illuminati. Oh.
[15852.39s -> 15855.27s]  Final one.
[15855.27s -> 15857.64s]  Yellow, yellow, white,
[15857.64s -> 15860.33s]  blue. We have to be in night vision
[15860.33s -> 15862.33s]  for this one. Freak mode, whatever
[15862.33s -> 15869.30s]  it's called. What was it again?
[15869.30s -> 15875.30s]  Yellow, green, blue.
[15875.30s -> 15880.41s]  I don't remember. Yellow, blue
[15880.41s -> 15883.48s]  and green. Yellow, yellow,
[15883.48s -> 15892.44s]  white and blue. White
[15892.44s -> 15903.24s]  and blue. Dine it. Right up
[15903.24s -> 15914.95s]  into the ceiling. Oh, it's a staircase.
[15914.95s -> 15917.83s]  Guys, it's a staircase.
[15917.83s -> 15920.39s]  It's a staircase.
[15920.39s -> 15931.08s]  Okay, a what?
[15931.08s -> 15944.82s]  Oh, cobwebs.
[15944.82s -> 15946.82s]  I hear it in the walls, the floor, the ceiling. It crawls all over this place.
[15946.82s -> 15948.82s]  Through it, under it. They are waiting.
[15948.82s -> 15950.82s]  I hear them. Spider's a boss or something?
[15950.82s -> 15952.82s]  Boss fight?
[15952.82s -> 15973.29s]  I don't wanna go in there.
[15973.29s -> 16004.20s]  That dude's in there. Say it?
[16004.20s -> 16006.20s]  Say it. No, I'm not gonna say it.
[16006.20s -> 16011.77s]  Only one more remains.
[16011.77s -> 16025.91s]  I hope the reverend found his
[16025.91s -> 16027.91s]  piece in the end. One more artifact to recover
[16027.91s -> 16029.91s]  before I have all I need to bring these forces
[16029.91s -> 16031.91s]  to heal. One more and I will release you
[16031.91s -> 16034.60s]  from your task. The last
[16034.60s -> 16036.60s]  soul thinks her twigs and roots will let her
[16036.60s -> 16038.60s]  dabble in worlds beyond her own.
[16038.60s -> 16040.60s]  She has no idea what she is meddling
[16040.60s -> 16052.55s]  with. Who is it?
[16052.55s -> 16054.55s]  Lady from Resi- uh...
[16054.55s -> 16062.47s]  Grandma from Resident Evil.
[16062.47s -> 16064.47s]  I said this was the- actually, this is the Resident Evil
[16064.47s -> 16068.25s]  fucking seven house.
[16068.25s -> 16070.25s]  This is actually the Resident Evil seven house.
[16070.25s -> 16078.49s]  Same layout.
[16078.49s -> 16080.49s]  Sure!
[16080.49s -> 16082.49s]  It's all okay. I'm sorry I made a shitty joke
[16082.49s -> 16084.49s]  and I punched you right in the face.
[16084.49s -> 16087.30s]  Oh, we get to make something!
[16087.30s -> 16089.54s]  Turkey! Okay, we gotta make
[16089.54s -> 16092.49s]  food. Ingredients, we get ingredients in
[16092.49s -> 16100.22s]  there. What else is in here?
[16100.22s -> 16114.74s]  Herd? What is this?
[16114.74s -> 16123.90s]  I'm gonna make a potion, eventually
[16123.90s -> 16125.90s]  here. Now, what else?
[16125.90s -> 16131.06s]  Also- oh.
[16131.06s -> 16143.40s]  Ayo.
[16143.40s -> 16145.40s]  The butcher arrives. When blind
[16145.40s -> 16147.40s]  to their master's shadow, even as the rod of
[16147.40s -> 16149.40s]  deceit rises off them, they
[16149.40s -> 16151.40s]  like a thousand burning embers.
[16151.40s -> 16153.40s]  He deceives them with- uh...
[16153.40s -> 16186.92s]  go to me.
[16186.92s -> 16199.64s]  Uh, I- I have to stop.
[16199.64s -> 16202.14s]  I have to stop. I have to.
[16202.14s -> 16210.44s]  I'm sorry. It's too- it's
[16210.44s -> 16212.44s]  my vibe- look at me.
[16212.44s -> 16217.03s]  Look at me.
[16217.03s -> 16221.83s]  I look like I have a sunburn!
[16221.83s -> 16223.83s]  Like, I was- I got too much sun!
[16223.83s -> 16230.74s]  I have a burn on my-
[16230.74s -> 16232.74s]  I have a burn on my face.
[16232.74s -> 16239.02s]  I have to- I gotta replace
[16239.02s -> 16241.02s]  this fucking thing. It's- it's horrible.
[16241.02s -> 16244.60s]  Take off the headband.
[16244.60s -> 16249.96s]  Mmm.
[16249.96s -> 16252.39s]  Radiation.
[16252.39s -> 16254.39s]  Yeah, man, VR is really fucking
[16254.39s -> 16256.39s]  cool. But- ah
[16256.39s -> 16258.39s]  God, I just wish there wasn't so much
[16258.39s -> 16267.22s]  radiation. It really does
[16267.22s -> 16269.22s]  look like a radiation burn.
[16269.22s -> 16273.45s]  Wha- how much radiation
[16273.45s -> 16275.45s]  is in a VR headset?
[16275.45s -> 16277.45s]  Did we know? Does anybody know what-
[16277.45s -> 16279.45s]  how much radiation evitst from here?
[16279.45s -> 16284.82s]  Alright, everybody wants it.
[16284.82s -> 16289.62s]  Sure, I'll- okay.
[16289.62s -> 16298.39s]  Get this in HD.
[16298.39s -> 16331.67s]  Here comes a headband reveal.
[16331.67s -> 16333.67s]  My- my career is over.
[16333.67s -> 16335.67s]  My- my looks are over. It's over.
[16335.67s -> 16337.67s]  It's over.
[16337.67s -> 16341.32s]  It's over.
[16341.32s -> 16358.92s]  It's- my poor hair.
[16358.92s -> 16360.92s]  Oh, my poor hair.
[16360.92s -> 16365.59s]  Mmm.
[16365.59s -> 16370.97s]  It was already so damaged
[16370.97s -> 16374.30s]  from the last few VRs.
[16374.30s -> 16376.30s]  Save it. Save it! I can- I'm gonna try.
[16376.30s -> 16378.66s]  I'm gonna try.
[16378.66s -> 16387.18s]  Ah. It'll bounce.
[16387.18s -> 16389.18s]  I'm not gonna bleach it. Look at how-
[16389.18s -> 16391.18s]  look at how fucking crazy this looks.
[16391.18s -> 16393.85s]  Wear a hat.
[16393.85s -> 16396.47s]  I- this is what I did this for!
[16396.47s -> 16398.47s]  So it would be, like, out of my head.
[16398.47s -> 16400.47s]  I'll wear a hat in VR?
[16400.47s -> 16405.59s]  I'll die in there.
[16405.59s -> 16407.59s]  I'll die in there if I wear a hat.
[16407.59s -> 16425.51s]  I'm not gonna shave my head.
[16425.51s -> 16433.64s]  No, I don't even shave it.
[16433.64s -> 16435.82s]  It's just- it's just all
[16435.82s -> 16441.32s]  dead. Look, my hairline's really
[16441.32s -> 16443.32s]  not that bad. It really isn't. You know, I had
[16443.32s -> 16445.32s]  a person at the salon told me,
[16445.32s -> 16447.32s]  Jeremy, you got another seven to ten years of that
[16447.32s -> 16458.50s]  hair. Alright.
[16458.50s -> 16461.45s]  That's it? I mean, that's it.
[16461.45s -> 16464.33s]  I'm thirty-five. You mean I get
[16464.33s -> 16466.33s]  to keep my hair till I'm, like, forty-five years old?
[16466.33s -> 16469.27s]  That's pretty sick, actually.
[16469.27s -> 16474.07s]  Seven to ten hours.
[16474.07s -> 16477.08s]  Oh, it's so- it's so beat up.
[16477.08s -> 16479.08s]  Oh, man.
[16479.08s -> 16481.08s]  No. No.
[16481.08s -> 16483.45s]  It's okay. I'm gonna go- okay, I'm
[16483.45s -> 16485.45s]  gonna go condition my hair right now.
[16485.45s -> 16487.45s]  I'm gonna go just condition my hair and leave it in for, like,
[16487.45s -> 16489.82s]  an hour. And I'm gonna play Half-Life
[16489.82s -> 16492.06s]  Alex tomorrow with, like-
[16492.06s -> 16494.55s]  Can I do, like, a- can I-
[16494.55s -> 16496.55s]  Can I have, like, a VR, like, surrogate- like,
[16496.55s -> 16498.55s]  can somebody be in the machine for me and I'll just
[16498.55s -> 16508.28s]  do commentary? Alright, I gotta
[16508.28s -> 16512.89s]  get out of here. Uh, I really
[16512.89s -> 16514.89s]  wanted to finish the room, too, but
[16514.89s -> 16517.51s]  no. No, it's time
[16517.51s -> 16522.50s]  to stop.
[16522.50s -> 16526.86s]  Sorry for the technical problems in the first
[16526.86s -> 16528.86s]  hour or so. It wasn't my
[16528.86s -> 16530.86s]  fault. We played, we were good.
[16530.86s -> 16533.80s]  But I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[16533.80s -> 16537.05s]  Have a good rest of your night.
[16537.05s -> 16539.05s]  I forgot about Otto. He's right here. He's just lying down.
[16539.05s -> 16542.70s]  I fucking- it hurts up
[16542.70s -> 16544.70s]  there. I- what should I do?
[16544.70s -> 16547.19s]  Salt?
[16547.19s -> 16549.19s]  Put, like, sea salt on it or something to make it so
[16549.19s -> 16551.19s]  it, like, calms the hair follicles down up there?
[16551.19s -> 16560.54s]  What should I do? I'm not gonna put bleach
[16560.54s -> 16564.50s]  in my hair. Oil?
[16564.50s -> 16566.50s]  Maybe some olive oil? Alright, I'm gonna- yeah, yeah,
[16566.50s -> 16569.83s]  I'm gonna do olive oil. Yeah.
[16569.83s -> 16571.83s]  I'm gonna do an olive oil treatment tonight.
[16571.83s -> 16578.81s]  Yep. I'm gonna do EVOO
[16578.81s -> 16580.98s]  with a little bit of tea tree oil.
[16580.98s -> 16583.61s]  I'm gonna fight this,
[16583.61s -> 16585.61s]  because I've, uh,
[16585.61s -> 16589.13s]  that looks real bad. Oh, man.
[16589.13s -> 16594.06s]  I'm gonna- I'm gonna replace
[16594.06s -> 16599.24s]  the face mask, too. Get a scalp massage.
[16599.24s -> 16603.40s]  Alright, I'll do that.
[16603.40s -> 16605.40s]  Thanks for watching, everybody. Thanks for the subs, too.
[16605.40s -> 16609.50s]  You know, if you're new to the channel, these are the credits
[16609.50s -> 16611.80s]  here. Everybody that's subbed, I do not read
[16611.80s -> 16615.00s]  subs on stream, because I am an
[16615.00s -> 16617.00s]  ungrateful fucking asshole streamer.
[16617.00s -> 16623.02s]  Nah, but seriously, thanks for the subs, everybody.
[16623.02s -> 16625.58s]  Thanks for the bits. Thanks for everything.
[16625.58s -> 16627.58s]  I actually think that- let me see. Take a look.
[16627.58s -> 16630.78s]  Oh, Jesus, we had- speaking of subs.
[16630.78s -> 16635.19s]  Wait, Mr. Sark gave
[16635.19s -> 16637.19s]  twenty community subs earlier?
[16637.19s -> 16640.52s]  No way. I missed that.
[16640.52s -> 16642.52s]  I was too in- into the headset.
[16642.52s -> 16647.82s]  Thanks, Sark, for those twenty subs.
[16647.82s -> 16650.44s]  Appreciate it. Uh, KaiStraw
[16650.44s -> 16653.38s]  thanks for the five community subs.
[16653.38s -> 16655.38s]  Malcolm thanks for the five subs.
[16655.38s -> 16657.75s]  Radshly thanks for the five subs.
[16657.75s -> 16659.75s]  Balls4brains five subs.
[16659.75s -> 16661.93s]  TexanToaster gave sixty
[16661.93s -> 16666.28s]  community subs. Thank you for the
[16666.28s -> 16669.42s]  insane amount of money. That's insane.
[16669.42s -> 16674.20s]  Sixty community subs.
[16674.20s -> 16676.20s]  That's more money than I could ever ask anyone to ever give a stranger
[16676.20s -> 16679.40s]  on the internet. That's a lot of money.
[16679.40s -> 16682.60s]  Thank you. And then InkCat
[16682.60s -> 16685.48s]  with five community subs as well.
[16685.48s -> 16693.86s]  Rounding us out there at the end. You can smell your
[16693.86s -> 16696.04s]  stinky gamer juices.
[16696.04s -> 16698.04s]  What the fuck even is- what's a gamer juice?
[16698.04s -> 16701.82s]  What does a game- what does that mean?
[16701.82s -> 16707.38s]  I really- I- dude, I'm
[16707.38s -> 16709.38s]  losing my mind. I really thought that
[16709.38s -> 16711.38s]  my, like, penis came out on stream today.
[16711.38s -> 16719.00s]  And I, like, freaked out about it.
[16719.00s -> 16722.14s]  That's completely impossible.
[16722.14s -> 16728.34s]  I have no idea why I thought that.
[16728.34s -> 16730.34s]  But it did.
[16730.34s -> 16737.82s]  Uh.
[16737.82s -> 16740.50s]  Uh, let's raid Joel.
[16740.50s -> 16742.50s]  Let's go say hello to Varg Skeletor.
[16742.50s -> 16748.33s]  And I will see you guys tomorrow with Half-Life
[16748.33s -> 16750.33s]  Alex. Okay, if I wake up
[16750.33s -> 16752.33s]  tomorrow and I look in the mirror, and I'm
[16752.33s -> 16754.95s]  just like, this looks horrible.
[16754.95s -> 16757.13s]  What do I do?
[16757.13s -> 16759.13s]  I'm gonna have to, like, put oil on my- I'm gonna have to oil
[16759.13s -> 16762.33s]  my hair back. I think that's what's
[16762.33s -> 16764.70s]  gonna happen. I'm gonna put, like,
[16764.70s -> 16766.70s]  just oil in my hair
[16766.70s -> 16768.70s]  so it slicks all the way back so that it does not touch
[16768.70s -> 16770.70s]  the coconut oil. Yeah.
[16770.70s -> 16776.84s]  Don't use a headband.
[16776.84s -> 16779.40s]  A swimming cap. Use olive oil.
[16779.40s -> 16781.64s]  I'm gonna put oil all over
[16781.64s -> 16783.64s]  my head tomorrow. That's the only way this is gonna
[16783.64s -> 16792.22s]  help. Thanks for watching, guys.
[16792.22s -> 16794.22s]  I'll see you soon. See you tomorrow. Take care.
[16794.22s -> 16796.22s]  Good night. And goodbye.
