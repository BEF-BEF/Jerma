[0.82s -> 9.26s]  Good afternoon. Welcome back. Red wizard. Today we're going to be doing a few things.
[9.90s -> 20.06s]  First of all before we really get into that. Did you have a good sleep? I did. I said that really
[20.06s -> 25.30s]  fast so you may not have caught that. I didn't. Remember how they had that headache last night?
[25.94s -> 32.90s]  Well it evolved into a migraine overnight and I've taken a few Tylenol and I'm all right.
[32.90s -> 39.46s]  I'm good. I just can't laugh that hard. Although like what a what a bad day to have a headache
[40.18s -> 44.49s]  because that's not possible. I'm gonna have to. I wish there was a way I could put like a filter
[44.49s -> 54.10s]  on my brain. I wish I could like take in a video file and like have it pre-screened and
[54.10s -> 64.39s]  pre-rendered and then like drip feed it into a part of my brain. Green screen movie night is
[64.39s -> 69.99s]  tonight. So like I gotta be ready. So I'm taking in some caffeine. I'll be fine. I
[69.99s -> 74.89s]  think I've took a couple Tylenol. I'm good to go. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't. If
[74.89s -> 85.16s]  I wasn't able to do it. So don't worry. What is green screen encore night? Well that's why we're
[85.16s -> 95.14s]  gonna we're gonna wait a little bit. I'm not gonna do it right away. There are about 50 plus
[95.14s -> 102.38s]  videos. Some of them are like 10 seconds. Some of them are like three minutes. There
[102.38s -> 108.30s]  are a couple of exceptions from some community members that have given us some movies
[109.18s -> 117.32s]  that are a little longer. It's the encore presentation will be about an hour and a half
[117.32s -> 129.08s]  to two hours. No it is not. 50 JoJo videos. So if you're not aware of what's going on
[130.73s -> 140.28s]  back in four or five months ago. Oh a long time ago. We watched about 400 green screen
[140.28s -> 147.00s]  videos. Since then people have made some good shit. So I obviously want to show those
[147.56s -> 153.88s]  the high quality submissions. There are still some shit posts in here. But we had a system
[153.88s -> 159.00s]  we weren't going to show every single one. This playlist will be publiced so you can watch it
[159.00s -> 166.58s]  whenever you want after this stream. And we will be doing this in like an hour. Because I
[166.58s -> 171.80s]  don't want to just start right now and go. Because obviously I want as many people that
[171.80s -> 175.08s]  will trickle in that want to be here to be here. So after about an hour I expect
[175.80s -> 179.24s]  most people that knew it was going to happen for the last three weeks will want to be here.
[180.28s -> 192.33s]  You know what I'm saying? Makes sense. Trickle. Make a playlist with every video that you
[192.33s -> 197.72s]  skipped. That's probably going to happen too. So there'll be just like a here's everything
[197.72s -> 202.60s]  and then here's the stuff that was on stream. It should be fun. I'm looking forward to it.
[203.16s -> 213.85s]  But before we do that, we've got some Super Mario to play. Super Mario Sunshine. I don't
[213.85s -> 231.06s]  know why I just said that. This is Mario Maker. Let me warm up with a couple of levels and then
[231.06s -> 235.06s]  from here we're going to do the online stuff. This is not going to be the castle building
[235.06s -> 240.74s]  stream. I promise. Everyone's just like oh no no no no what the fuck. He's not going to do
[240.74s -> 246.18s]  like Mario Maker single player just story mode again. Well I am. But just for like five
[246.18s -> 256.65s]  minutes. So I also have to check this too. One two three jump jump jump jump. We good?
[256.65s -> 269.96s]  Good. Five hours. What if I just don't do the Encore Knight? I get so into this. We just don't
[269.96s -> 279.61s]  ever do it. March of the Rookie Toads. This is another Peach level. Ten Toads. I wouldn't do that
[279.61s -> 289.30s]  to you guys. Don't have to go all the way to the left. Oh shit what's this? One two three. How
[289.30s -> 307.00s]  do I get that? What's this? Can I like pull this up? I'm not going to do that. Yank it?
[309.88s -> 318.20s]  Can I wait can I yank that thing? No there's no indicator. I can't yank it. It's probably
[318.20s -> 327.85s]  to be lit up. Let's get rid of the piranha. I want to see what's down here. Reach the goal after
[327.85s -> 335.27s]  defeating all piranha creepers. You got it. You got it. So somewhere around I don't want to say
[335.27s -> 342.34s]  maybe like 430? Five pacific? 430 pacific? Oh I'm gonna know when it's been like an hour or
[342.34s -> 347.10s]  two because people are gonna be screaming in here. It's Encore Knight! I just I'm not
[347.10s -> 363.53s]  supposed to yell it. I have a headache. What does this want me to do? Oh shit that's what it
[363.53s -> 379.94s]  wanted me to do. Huh? Did it. First try. Yeah that was fun. That was a good one. I think that's
[379.94s -> 391.37s]  enough warming up. I think I know what I'm doing. I mean if I can do that I can definitely
[391.93s -> 396.57s]  like have somebody honk a horn in my face and scream while I go through 18 different doors
[396.57s -> 403.48s]  and have them open up and have like spikes underneath me. I think I can do that. This is
[403.48s -> 423.21s]  new. Oh I have this item now. I can do this. What the fuck is under here? Empty? What am I
[423.21s -> 442.71s]  doing? Oh this is a robot. Rebooting system. I'm sorry. Sorry. Well I turned it on. Interesting.
[442.71s -> 457.43s]  All right what's on the other side? Coins. Well I can't really leave yet. Hold on. Encore
[457.43s -> 465.05s]  Movie Knight's like paused for a minute. Hold on. Can I not break these? Beep beep. Rebooting
[465.05s -> 470.33s]  system. Beep beep boop. Reboot complete. Beep beep beep. Authenticating mustache.
[472.20s -> 480.70s]  Beep authenticated. Beep boop. You are Mario correct? No. Beep boop lie detected. Mario confirmed.
[481.85s -> 487.86s]  Beep boop beep beep. I'm a robot that plays videos. Which video do you want to watch?
[489.64s -> 509.08s]  Oh that's it? Beep boop beep boop. I'm going to play Encore Movie Knight. That's too bad.
[509.08s -> 530.09s]  Why am I even? No I don't want to skip this video. So 50 dollars came in from some guy.
[530.17s -> 536.44s]  Thank you some guy for the 50 bucks. They say hey Jerma I think I found a family picture of you
[536.44s -> 543.54s]  from a while ago. That'll be weird. Oh okay. Thank you so much for the 50 dollars first of all.
[543.54s -> 556.87s]  And oh okay it's a clown thing. And Jerma told the truth about X. What is it X?
[561.90s -> 570.89s]  Oh that was a juicy one. That was a juicy one. Anything you want it to be.
[573.02s -> 576.54s]  Well thank you for the five community subs and thank you some guy for the 50 bucks.
[577.18s -> 582.62s]  Now there's a picture of a clown. I don't know like here's the image. It's just like it's like
[582.62s -> 588.66s]  a family of the clown with like a kid in a clown costume. I don't know. All right I'm

[599.24s -> 603.40s]  challenge for a little bit? Just see what happens. Or should I do like one of the
[603.40s -> 616.97s]  popular ones? So this is hot. This is called jungle. It takes 23 minutes and 46
[616.97s -> 620.89s]  seconds to go through this level. Oh no that's the time. I told you I don't do military
[620.89s -> 650.18s]  time. Short and sweet. Let's do it. Play. Jungle. Do I have to jump up on this thing's head?
[650.18s -> 674.66s]  I can't touch this stuff. Oh I guess we're just riding this up. No but wait what? That's it.

[1007.77s -> 1017.16s]  Hey yeet. Boy. Why am I being bombarded by fucking pop-ups?
[1017.16s -> 1022.87s]  Do I have to? Why do I have to see these? You know that it's not appropriate for
[1022.87s -> 1040.15s]  Super Mario. Are these people chatting? Is this a chat room? Is this just a bunch of ads?
[1040.15s -> 1063.35s]  This is billboard city. All right so now I go. How do I turn that one on? I did it. Stop
[1063.35s -> 1080.20s]  saying series speedrun. Oh my bum. Oh it's very distracting. How do I make one of these?
[1081.00s -> 1087.69s]  I'm just gonna put an advertisement for my channel. Except it's not gonna be my channel.

[1103.72s -> 1119.29s]  Grill master. I need one of those hats. Cool idea. Wow. Wow. I think this is intentional
[1119.29s -> 1127.05s]  to have just be irritating because it's very irritating. How do I do? How do I do this?
[1127.85s -> 1149.59s]  Do I have to jump from here to there? What? Oh this is number one in the world right now.
[1149.59s -> 1154.87s]  This is what I was talking about. I told you guys. I told you guys we needed to wait like a
[1154.87s -> 1189.69s]  few days. Oh shit. Don't do it. Yeet. Yeet. Give me the hat. Give me the hat. Give me the
[1189.69s -> 1216.44s]  hat. Give me the hat. Go to settings, change your character. I was trying to see if there's

[1244.63s -> 1247.99s]  I will turn them off after this. I feel like it's part of the experience.
[1261.14s -> 1265.22s]  Yeah. I will turn them off. See that person died down there and they're vote oof.
[1272.95s -> 1291.88s]  Secret. Hey thanks for the help dark souls friend. Illusionary wall detected. Oh get that coin.
[1292.44s -> 1298.97s]  What do the coins do in multiplayer? I mean and um what do they do? Do you like buy currency
[1298.97s -> 1311.67s]  or anything? Do you buy anything with this shit? Nothing. I don't get to build my own castle.
[1311.67s -> 1315.03s]  Oh they dropped the ball on that one. They introduced that in single player and I don't
[1315.03s -> 1339.83s]  have my own castle that I can build. Here comes a clown joke. Oh shit. Wait what?
[1341.83s -> 1348.79s]  I don't have to drop them. Come on give me another mushroom quick.
[1350.97s -> 1372.70s]  Holy shit. Okay I gotta be careful. I did it. Hooray. It's not possible to lose. That's
[1372.70s -> 1381.50s]  pretty cool idea. All right now I'm gonna I'm gonna be Toad and I'm gonna turn off comments.
[1382.06s -> 1387.80s]  I feel like I'm running like a YouTube channel. I'm gonna turn off comments. I'm
[1387.80s -> 1390.44s]  gonna turn off engagements. I'm gonna make it so like only one person can
[1391.24s -> 1441.14s]  do that. Whoops. I think I'm gonna. All right for the next one I'm just gonna start doing like
[1441.14s -> 1454.94s]  paid iPhone game reviews. You'll see what I mean in a minute. Only 12 percent clear rate.
[1454.94s -> 1467.43s]  Let's go back to popular. How do I go back from here? Popular. I want to go back to
[1467.43s -> 1474.97s]  like the. There we go. Self destruct activated. This is a speed run. Auto scroll speed run.
[1478.22s -> 1482.22s]  Oh this. Look at this one. Seven percent completion rate. I'll do this one.
[1482.94s -> 1485.96s]  My most popular course remastered. Are you ready to blast off?
[1486.68s -> 1502.23s]  They get to be Toad. That's cake Toad too. That's the best one. How do I turn this off?
[1502.23s -> 1518.04s]  No no no I want to turn this off. No I'm not doing pretty cool here. Here we go.

[1558.41s -> 1590.55s]  No go. The music. That's too much. That music is too fast. Jesus what the fuck is hitting me?
[1590.55s -> 1603.56s]  I don't even know what's hitting me. There's the bombs. I gotta get the star.

[1624.44s -> 1652.57s]  Oh come on. Go go go go go go go. Don't just go. Forget it. There's no reason to get it.
[1653.05s -> 1671.06s]  Did I win? Why does Toad have a fucking like beard belly? Big mushroom Toad has a dad bod.
[1671.62s -> 1683.21s]  All right over 20 seconds. Switch block blast. People really into the switch thing huh?
[1683.85s -> 1695.43s]  And then do infinite run. I will. I will. Oh we got. No it's not quite cake Toad. That's
[1696.79s -> 1719.83s]  close though. Holy shit that was kind of crazy. Oh oh I missed. I missed that. That
[1719.83s -> 1760.44s]  was right there right at the end. Oh got them all. Oh got all the coins. What was my 19.7? Oh
[1764.34s -> 1772.54s]  come on. What's that? World record right there? Damn it. Oh well. I like that. That was a good
[1772.54s -> 1821.24s]  one. You beat the world record. Oh I could be up there as world record. What was that? How
[1821.24s -> 1826.82s]  long was that? No I got caught up on that first pole and then I got caught up on the first
[1826.82s -> 1833.72s]  pole. Oh do it again. I'll get it. I'm gonna get it. I'm gonna get the world record on this
[1833.72s -> 1888.07s]  one. Start over. Start over. It's that first cut there. I'm gonna try. I'm gonna try it. Not
[1888.07s -> 1914.09s]  quite. You gotta get clean over that first pillar. Three nanoseconds. You gotta go
[1915.06s -> 1935.32s]  later. I get it. There it is. Oh did I? I think I fucked it up. No I didn't.
[1936.04s -> 1943.64s]  I think I fucked it up. I think I fucked it up. I don't know. We'll see. I know. I think
[1943.64s -> 1976.95s]  I fucked it up. That was frame fucking perfect. You can't do it better than that.
[1976.95s -> 1981.34s]  That was frame perfect. This is the one.
[2009.03s -> 2014.86s]  I can't believe it. I'll get it. It's uh it's when you go over the uh
[2015.74s -> 2033.91s]  this part here. Wait a minute. He how do you get? Hold on. I'm gonna beat it by a shitload.
[2033.91s -> 2053.64s]  I'm gonna beat it by a shitload. That thing's gonna hit the... Watch this. Dude I have to do
[2053.64s -> 2062.20s]  it. It's three nanoseconds. I have to be up there as Jeremy 4567. I have to do this.
[2079.29s -> 2083.66s]  I didn't even jump. What am I thinking? I'm the only person that's died here.
[2098.44s -> 2109.53s]  Oh man. I'm gonna lose my fucking mind. I have to do this. Moving height is cancelled
[2109.53s -> 2121.93s]  until I do this. I fucking lost it. I added that foot. That's I'm gonna I'm gonna see
[2121.93s -> 2149.50s]  point I'm gonna see zero point zero zero zero in my dreams. No. No. I'm gonna...
[2150.78s -> 2159.85s]  You gotta jump earlier I think to get over that. It's not gonna be it. You gotta go
[2159.85s -> 2248.70s]  earlier. Pretty good. Fuck. Nope. Nope. Nope. Not gonna be it. It's the treadmill.
[2248.70s -> 2282.44s]  Oh god damn it. Oh come on. That's gonna be close. No it's that. Mario has a bigger frame
[2282.44s -> 2320.70s]  hitbox. Luigi has a bigger... It's that little bit right there. Luigi's faster on the treadmill.
[2321.34s -> 2342.94s]  Are you serious? Is Toad just screwing me over here? What did I just do? What was it?
[2342.94s -> 2347.69s]  What was it for? What's the default? No. Nintendo. I want to press B.
[2377.32s -> 2409.96s]  I got to point three nanoseconds man. Pretty good. Oh my god. My god damn it. My god. What
[2409.96s -> 2415.77s]  the fuck am I doing? I was trying to hit the very last frame of it so I'd fall on top of
[2415.77s -> 2492.06s]  the axe. Pretty good. How did I get 316 before man? No. You gotta. You gotta. It's the treadmill
[2492.06s -> 2497.18s]  but how do I deal? How do I take care of that? Is it less jumps? One jump? Two jump?
[2497.18s -> 2519.30s]  Trying to get it in one jump? But how? Lightly tap? Lightly press? Fuck.
[2536.66s -> 2538.66s]  No time lost. This is as fast as you can walk forward.
[2539.06s -> 2553.59s]  Mmmmmmmmmm. It's gonna be not even close. You are 0.000003 seconds away from the world
[2553.59s -> 2555.99s]  record. You can move on. Chat won't call you a loser.
[2564.02s -> 2582.70s]  Well, I appreciate that. Thank you. That doesn't mean I'm not still hungry. The thing is,
[2583.50s -> 2592.95s]  how do I get that to happen sooner? You got it. Let's probably get a way you can
[2592.95s -> 2605.90s]  make him go fuller faster right? No, no. I gotta. I know what I gotta do.
[2605.90s -> 2630.18s]  Check this out. That wasn't running fast enough. This is the one. It's not the fucking one,
[2630.18s -> 2656.78s]  not the fucking one. It's over! I lost! I can feel it catch it on me.
[2660.33s -> 2676.20s]  Please stop. I can't help it. You can't get to 0.0003 to the world record on this level
[2676.20s -> 2701.62s]  and then not do it. Wait a minute. Can I get up there from not hitting the switch?
[2702.18s -> 2767.82s]  I'm losing frames in the start. I hate it! There's no such thing as bunny hopping.
[2767.82s -> 2792.68s]  Nope. I looked over and I just saw. What a loser. See? That was so close but not enough!
[2797.75s -> 2853.30s]  Short hop onto the shell. I'm never gonna do it. The world record is frame perfectly time gated.
[2853.86s -> 2865.54s]  Even if you were to... Wait, what are you talking about? What does frame perfectly time
[2865.54s -> 2912.70s]  gated mean? You can only match it not beat it. What? What are you talking about? I'm done.
[2912.70s -> 3012.90s]  This is the one right here. How do I get? Oh, whoops. Here. Sorry. It should be me up there!
[3012.90s -> 3069.46s]  It should be me up there! One more time. I'm done. I swear to god. I promise this is the
[3069.46s -> 3109.27s]  final one. This is the last time I'm gonna do this. That's not very good. I have to get out.
[3109.27s -> 3125.78s]  Just go. I don't care what this is. Toad's faster. No, he's not. I only know how to do
[3125.78s -> 3130.98s]  one thing and that's the... I don't know how to do anything else right now. I forgot
[3130.98s -> 3141.30s]  how to play every other part of the game. Honestly, let me ask. How do speedrunners
[3141.30s -> 3145.46s]  like brush their teeth? You know what I mean? I did that for like an hour. I feel like if I
[3145.46s -> 3149.06s]  did that for like six more days, I wouldn't remember how to fucking tie my shoes.
[3149.94s -> 3179.00s]  My brain like hurts right now. Wait, did I just mess it up? Oh, almost screwed that one
[3179.00s -> 3204.30s]  up. I like this one. I'm hearing more than one sound for an hour. Faster. No. No more faster.
[3210.65s -> 3220.23s]  This is dangerous. You only played that level for 15 minutes? I feel like I've been here for
[3220.23s -> 3265.66s]  like three days. Fuck. Puzzle. Epic puzzle. Hearts. Hmm. Oh shit, I was looking up at the...
[3267.42s -> 3294.18s]  Oops. Dude. Puzzle. Really. Don't do it to me, please. What the fuck am I doing?
[3294.18s -> 3330.63s]  Stop. Okay. That was cute. That was cute. Wait, what? No. Looking good. Movie night died for
[3330.63s -> 3346.74s]  this. Movie night's still happening. When? In like 30, 40 minutes? In like an hour? I want to
[3346.74s -> 3352.06s]  make sure that enough people are here to enjoy it. That's why I said I was gonna do... I can
[3352.06s -> 3369.96s]  do that. I'm kidding. That's hard. Sun Touch Sanctuary. Puzzle solving 1-1 homecoming hills.
[3373.34s -> 3406.82s]  It's been an hour. It's been 57 minutes. It's just another version.
[3412.06s -> 3420.31s]  Oh no. Oh no. Let me just get to the end first and let me see what it looks like.
[3421.19s -> 3451.90s]  I ran out of time. He ran out of time on a speed run.
[3467.24s -> 3502.41s]  GG. What did I get? 199929. I can do it. Oh! Thought I could make it.
[3502.41s -> 3520.36s]  Shit. Only a couple more attempts. Let me finish it like one more or two more times.
[3521.08s -> 3538.66s]  I gotta get to the end though. Last one. One where I get to the end. You bet $50 that I'm
[3538.66s -> 3545.05s]  gonna get the world record? You think so? I'll take that bet. Who's got that bet? Anybody in
[3545.05s -> 3559.61s]  here? Anybody betting? Anybody betting right now? Shit. That's what I have to do. I'm sorry
[3559.61s -> 3586.76s]  guys. Somebody's money, people's money is on the line. I have to make sure I try. Come on.
[3586.76s -> 3601.83s]  I thought I did it. I thought I actually did it. One more try. I thought I was on the right for a
[3601.83s -> 3647.67s]  second. That's as fucking clean as I'm gonna get it. Come on. 20 seconds. Pow block blitz.
[3647.67s -> 3672.76s]  Oh I like this one. Speed run. Short and sweet. Down $50. Oh shit. That's right. Somebody,
[3672.76s -> 3682.23s]  oh somebody get, speaking of $50, Phil. Phil gave $50 and I, hold on. This is like an
[3682.23s -> 3697.98s]  hour ago. Speaking of Phil. Thank you so much for the 50 bucks, Phil. Phil 25. They
[3697.98s -> 3701.02s]  say, hey Jerma, long time watch. Your first time cheer. It's been so fun lurking around your
[3701.02s -> 3709.48s]  content ever since 2013. Just got my first paycheck at my first serious job and I want
[3709.48s -> 3714.60s]  to give back a little. Also thanks for making me the one guy at last E3 Streams credits those
[3714.60s -> 3719.70s]  two weeks ago. Unfortunately can't catch many streams from EU so I rely on VODs,
[3721.18s -> 3724.70s]  but it's still worth watching for the best entertainment out there. Much love and hope your
[3724.70s -> 3733.34s]  life is going just as well. Jerma Hart. Thank you. Thank you, Phil. I do feel bad
[3733.82s -> 3738.38s]  about, I have to pick that up, about EU times ever since moving to Pacific,
[3740.44s -> 3747.26s]  but I'm at least glad that you can watch the VODs and can enjoy them if you, now that's gonna
[3747.26s -> 3759.18s]  take too much time here. I'm not gonna get stuck here. If you get world record on any
[3759.18s -> 3771.56s]  of these speedrun levels I will sub to you. It's a $5 bill. No, don't say that.
[3779.62s -> 3785.78s]  Fast switch thinking. Let's do this one. This one looks cute. Okay. Only 3% completion
[3785.78s -> 3809.43s]  rate on this one. And we'll get a cake Luigi. That's good. You see. How do I, why did I just
[3809.43s -> 3819.99s]  do that? Also if I get a world record on, if I get a world record on a stage you'll
[3820.55s -> 3845.42s]  sub to the channel. Like at least three or four people said that, right? Okay.
[3861.35s -> 3873.27s]  I'll have to beat it. I can't even get a world record here. All right I'm not gonna,
[3873.27s -> 3877.11s]  just, they're sleeping. Just step on their heads. What's the point of that?
[3878.23s -> 3884.30s]  It's a troll purpose. What is this for? I can take my fucking time. Who cares? Get in the car.
[3898.31s -> 3944.18s]  World record. Why would you, I can't. So get out of the car and just go in the tube.
[3963.59s -> 3984.42s]  No go, I'm trying to just get away from this. World record. Let me see some fucking
[3984.42s -> 3992.94s]  pogchamps in the chat. I think I got it. I think I got it. What are you talking about?
[3994.65s -> 4034.84s]  What are you talking about? Get it! A million subs. A million subs. A million subs. Let me
[4034.84s -> 4054.15s]  take a look. There it is. You set your first world record. I did it. These are all the
[4054.15s -> 4059.08s]  people that bet it against me. 10 community subs from Lexi and five community subs from
[4060.04s -> 4063.38s]  It has to be a speedrun level? Well that wasn't part of the plan.
[4065.75s -> 4070.23s]  I just said a million subs and now it and now it's happening. Thank you Bebraham for the 20
[4070.23s -> 4087.02s]  community subs. 20 from MGSFan. Thank you for the huge subs. But wait a minute. What about
[4087.02s -> 4094.50s]  the, what about the one guy? Oh my god, a shitload of coming in. Fine I'll do, I'll do a
[4094.50s -> 4109.77s]  speedrun course. Uh knock, Lexi another 10. Knock turn. Thanks for the five community subs

[4152.82s -> 4164.46s]  Gay5 thank you whoever you are. Rare Pepe Body Lotion thanks for the five community subs.

[4186.58s -> 4190.98s]  subs of the shitload just came in. I mean I know that was like a joke but like seriously

[4215.78s -> 4240.39s]  How do I turn it on? What's on? Thank you Spygetti for the 10 community subs.
[4240.39s -> 4250.63s]  For heat of meat thanks for five community subs. That's not world record piss. I can do better than
[4250.63s -> 4273.53s]  that. I'm just going through and fucking dumping on the world records because let's be let's be
[4273.53s -> 4278.97s]  honest uh who's actually gonna play these more than once but then care enough to do world
[4278.97s -> 4291.96s]  record? I got another world record. Oh my god the Lemmy just gave 75 gold. Let's go play the
[4291.96s -> 4295.32s]  like the actual other mode because it's been an hour and I want to do the endless challenge
[4295.32s -> 4300.78s]  once. At least before we do the uh five more subs from AB Joe. Thank you so much AB Joe. Thank
[4300.78s -> 4306.54s]  you all you guys for the subs and uh 75 fucking dollars from uh Vilemi. Congratulations on the
[4306.54s -> 4311.10s]  world record Jerma. Why not celebrate by chugging down a not at all disgusting Mountain Dew throw
[4311.10s -> 4315.82s]  back. Don't think I've forgotten about your lies. Thank you for the 75 dollars but I
[4315.82s -> 4329.05s]  wouldn't drink a Mountain Dew throwback for 5 000 dollars. Thank you so much for the 75 super
[4329.05s -> 4341.91s]  expert. This is a bad idea but thank you so much Vilemi for the 75 bucks. Thank you for the 50
[4341.91s -> 4349.62s]  dollars from Timmy. They just say oh like the oh no face oh no it's like an oh face.
[4354.10s -> 4369.75s]  Why do I have 30 lives? Speedrun. What? Go backwards and then down but thank you so much
[4369.75s -> 4376.92s]  for the 50 bucks Timmy and Vilemi and everybody that's dumping huge amounts of subs. You guys
[4376.92s -> 4399.69s]  are too much. Oh fuck. What? I gotta do the spin move. Why did he just no no no this is not
[4399.69s -> 4410.17s]  like I only have 28 lives. You need to spin. Spin spin spin. No I got it. I can do this
[4410.17s -> 4414.65s]  Nintendo. Leave me alone. Don't Luigi me. I'm already playing as Luigi. Don't you get it?
[4420.94s -> 4456.09s]  Oh fuck. Shut the fuck up and beat the level Jeremy. I can go faster than that too.
[4456.81s -> 4461.93s]  You want to hear like some crazy shit? I could do it but I can't. My brain is so small that
[4461.93s -> 4472.28s]  I can only do one thing at a time. Oh what the fuck do I go? What the fuck? Where do I go?
[4473.88s -> 4491.30s]  I don't know where to go. What what's on? Backwards? Up? Forward? Where was I? Go back
[4491.30s -> 4508.79s]  and then to the left? How the way do I end up? Oh who cares? I just hurt myself.
[4509.43s -> 4516.68s]  I just like went to go drink my drink and the straw just like poked me like in the back of the
[4516.68s -> 4547.14s]  mouth because I leaned. I leaned. I like this one though. This one's well thought out. I'll get
[4547.14s -> 4556.04s]  this. And by the way stay tuned for the green screen encore movie night happening soon just
[4556.04s -> 4561.86s]  like every fucking event you've ever seen. Especially on this platform. It's gonna be
[4561.86s -> 4568.23s]  like six hours delayed. I have no idea what the hell to do after that.
[4581.86s -> 4604.95s]  Explain to me. I have to go back up that way. 20 omega lol lives. Whatever. I swear to god.
[4604.95s -> 4631.67s]  Super expert. I'm fine. You gotta just. I know I know what I have to do now. It doesn't. You
[4631.67s -> 4635.99s]  just hold left. You don't have to worry but you're gonna put that hat on. It's automatic.
[4635.99s -> 4660.50s]  This is not disqualified. Jeremy turns his face come on and reveals he was dressed as
[4660.58s -> 4689.78s]  Luigi this whole time. Even if I was who cares? What would that even matter? Hey guys I have
[4689.78s -> 4716.04s]  overalls today. Oh shit. Now what? What the? Okay uh I got freaked out when the thing came
[4716.04s -> 4755.75s]  off my head. I hurt. I got hit by something and he went. Oh you punk. You rotten kid.
[4756.79s -> 4764.28s]  You punk. I don't care if I lose. I did it. I don't know what the fuck was that.
[4765.53s -> 4772.09s]  I swear to god my brain was on slow motion. I got freaked out. I died but I didn't die. I don't know.
[4783.42s -> 4803.13s]  Come on. Super Luigi. Come on. Everybody loves Luigi. Did I really not make that jump? That's
[4803.13s -> 4811.18s]  unbelievable. What was wrong there? Was it not? Whatever. I'm gonna. I'll get through this.
[4811.90s -> 4819.75s]  It's not 100 lives Mario anymore. You just have to beat it. I've already gone panicking.
[4819.75s -> 4830.73s]  Slow down. Who cares if you don't get the world record? Yeah it's not gonna look good in a YouTube
[4830.73s -> 4849.13s]  video but I'll still get there. What the fuck is happening? If I didn't get like baited into
[4849.13s -> 4862.52s]  jumping into those coins. Okay so am I what? Am I understanding that? I'm fine. Go back. So if
[4862.52s -> 4867.88s]  you put out. If you don't do the swimmy arms then that. What is you doing? What?
[4868.04s -> 4886.95s]  Hold on. What is this? Hey thank you for the five communities. Never trust nanners. Thank you.
[4900.34s -> 4906.74s]  I swear to god I pressed the button. I did. I pressed it. I pressed it. I pressed it in it.
[4906.74s -> 4943.22s]  I'm get. I'm tilted now. Excuse me what happened there? What happened? Why did I
[4943.22s -> 4947.46s]  overshoot that? I did that every time the same way. Something must be wrong with the game.
[4948.34s -> 4953.45s]  You know actually no I heard. I heard about that. I heard about like Nintendo was patching
[4953.45s -> 4959.96s]  some of their control issues. Yeah I started like an article on Kotaku about like control
[4959.96s -> 4977.94s]  issues or something. I almost just fucking let go of the controller. Yeah Nintendo was like
[4977.94s -> 4981.22s]  saying at them like a press release came up from Nintendo saying like we're sorry about
[4981.22s -> 4987.46s]  the control problems. We just like didn't test them and like we're just really sorry about it
[4988.02s -> 4992.74s]  but it'll be fixed. So like when you guys buy this game you guys like get this game later
[4992.74s -> 4999.43s]  like you're gonna have like a different game than me. So that's why like I'm not doing so
[4999.43s -> 5013.98s]  good but you'll like do better than me because like the patches will be there by then. Essentially
[5013.98s -> 5018.70s]  what I have to do is I'm hold I have to queue up controls. There's like four or five seconds
[5018.70s -> 5050.44s]  of input lag. All right come on. I gotta jump like at the very last second up here.
[5053.94s -> 5058.82s]  What is the problem here? I'm what how am I not making this?
[5063.56s -> 5083.72s]  That was as far to the end as I possibly could. What's happening? Good thing I had 30 lives.
[5088.07s -> 5093.59s]  I did it! Okay hold on. Wait just I'm not going fast enough. What the fuck is happening
[5093.59s -> 5115.59s]  in my brain? I just I had to I put the I put the car in reverse. Oh my god. Oh my god.
[5116.23s -> 5129.43s]  You just have to keep moving and I didn't and I put the car in reverse.
[5130.15s -> 5151.22s]  You can never put the car in reverse in a speedrun level. Ever. Here we go. Now what? What?
[5152.02s -> 5159.70s]  Now what the fuck am I supposed to know? Um um does he kill him? What? Back again?
[5160.42s -> 5166.49s]  What? Do you have to go boy have to go back and then jump over the coins and then go back
[5166.57s -> 5194.28s]  down? Oh shit I'm gonna lose. This is it. This is the last chance. Oh my god what the fuck did I do?
[5195.08s -> 5203.03s]  Oh my god. I just I didn't mean to press that button. Like sir I just I just like bah
[5203.91s -> 5208.78s]  do it again. Fucking whatever. Oh my god I'm so upset right now.
[5210.14s -> 5215.18s]  I was pressing too hard on Y therefore every button on the controller is pressed.
[5216.52s -> 5229.27s]  Oh god damn it give me a break. I'm so fucking mad right now. I had that too.
[5230.23s -> 5235.99s]  I need to get like a pro controller not like the fucking side cheese it controller. All right
[5235.99s -> 5255.26s]  I'm gonna I gotta breathe for a second here. Why am I using like the mini hot dog bun
[5255.26s -> 5306.02s]  controllers? The hell? What? I'm so on tilt right now. Like you didn't just shake the
[5306.02s -> 5310.90s]  pinball machine. You took a hammer and just wound up and smashed into the middle of the
[5310.90s -> 5331.62s]  glass and just started stealing components. There's really a fucking troll block right
[5331.62s -> 5369.94s]  there too. Here comes the explosion. The spin doesn't work. Do I have to be big?
[5372.73s -> 5378.33s]  Oh that stupid block. I'm not cut out for this. I'm not cut out for this.
[5399.50s -> 5417.05s]  All right I got a mushroom. I fucking forgot again. I'm not going down. Super goddamn expert
[5417.05s -> 5449.43s]  give me a break. Fuck expert. Fuck this. Fuck the Oscars. What the hell is this for?
[5449.99s -> 5474.81s]  There's gotta be a reason for that. Now watch out for this dickhead that flies from here.
[5474.81s -> 5493.50s]  Okay I should just go immediately. What am I waiting for? I'm scared that thing's gonna
[5493.50s -> 5532.58s]  pop out and kill me. That's what you have to do. Okay I'm just going right in. I'm just
[5532.58s -> 5537.24s]  gonna go right into the bulb. Watch this. Ready? Just right in. Immediately. Go go go go go.
[5537.24s -> 5556.82s]  No don't don't. What are you doing? Get the heart. Whatever the thing is. I did it.
[5558.54s -> 5564.41s]  Now what? Now what's the rest of this? Movies movies. Hold on. Wait wait wait. Just wait wait
[5564.41s -> 5585.02s]  wait wait wait. Did I do it? Not yet. Let me at least beat. Somebody said if I beat one super
[5585.02s -> 5604.38s]  expert level they'll download. I'm gonna be quiet. Can I even beat this anymore? I don't
[5604.38s -> 5607.10s]  think this is not completable. I picked them all up. I didn't know that was what was gonna
[5607.10s -> 5647.24s]  happen. Dick. Get hit by it. Come on. Get hit by that. What happened to the- what am I supposed
[5647.24s -> 5664.47s]  to do? Just die. We're gonna- don't worry. The movie night's coming soon. Just hold on
[5664.47s -> 5670.58s]  and let me beat this. I have to beat one super expert otherwise I'm- I have to download. Why
[5670.58s -> 5676.98s]  do I keep saying download? Why do I keep saying the word download? What's go- what's wrong with
[5676.98s -> 5689.19s]  me? Those are all the word- that's that's the only word that's in my brain. I'm gonna
[5689.19s -> 5693.43s]  have to download. You guys I will be careful guys. You guys- I don't want you- you guys
[5694.39s -> 5705.56s]  I seriously I'm fucking so dumb that I- I've been hit by that every single time and I can't do it
[5705.56s -> 5727.08s]  because I need the mushroom. Hold on let me download. Don't get hit by the fucking thwomp.
[5727.08s -> 5732.76s]  It just comes out of nowhere for no reason. It's only- it's only there to make you angry
[5732.76s -> 5739.50s]  and it's working. Don't be angry by this. It's- it's- it's working as intentional.
[5745.08s -> 5762.78s]  He tricked us into watching him play Mario. No I didn't. I did not. Okay now I'm gonna do it.
[5763.75s -> 5768.63s]  I just need to leave the fire flowers out here. I just need one. I'm gonna get the one at the
[5768.63s -> 5792.47s]  very end. Okay so I'm ready. Did that- what? It hits you? Excuse me Bowser. Please get the fuck
[5792.47s -> 5803.88s]  out of the way. I got hit by the- I'm so angry. I- I better beat this or my whole day
[5803.88s -> 5867.48s]  is gonna be ruined. What? Wait! Oh god Bowser please! I win. Okay. I can calm down now.
[5868.12s -> 5883.26s]  I did it. I beat a super expert level. Somebody owes me 50 grand. I mean now I gotta- I mean
[5883.26s -> 5897.32s]  I- I gotta keep going. 50 downloads. All right all right all right all right all right all
[5897.32s -> 5912.42s]  right all right. Settle down. Settle down. It's time. It is time for some movies. Settle
[5912.42s -> 5931.30s]  down. Everybody relax. I need to change this to this. We're going to return to Super Mario
[5931.30s -> 5946.14s]  after this. A hundred dollars just came in from A- AB Joe. Not quite 50 grand but here's second
[5946.14s -> 5952.70s]  place prize for your 0.003 speedrun attempt. Thank you. Thank you for the hundred fucking
[5952.70s -> 5960.42s]  dollars and your huge amount of community subs. So without further ado let me just make sure
[5960.42s -> 5962.66s]  this is in the right spot.
