[0.00s -> 2.40s]  Oh, no friendly fire. We always play with no friendly fire.
[3.36s -> 5.78s]  Um, that was a nice ghost car.
[7.12s -> 9.52s]  I like alt-tabbed. Let me fix my mouse.
[11.04s -> 11.76s]  That guy-
[11.76s -> 14.64s]  This guy just like pull up so I can get in his car. Thanks.
[14.64s -> 15.44s]  I think he just peeped you.
[15.44s -> 16.88s]  It's a pretty nice car. Thank you.
[20.03s -> 21.55s]  You didn't have to- he- what?
[21.55s -> 24.83s]  He's the nicest person I've ever seen in this game and you shoot him.
[24.83s -> 28.43s]  I only shoot- I shot- I shot him in the ass. He'll be alright.
[28.43s -> 29.07s]  He's dead.
[29.07s -> 30.35s]  Have you ever seen Forrest Gump?
[31.94s -> 43.20s]  Yeah, thank you for coming everybody. Shady Home is Retirement Home.
[43.20s -> 45.68s]  Yeah, we do a garage sale every year here.
[45.68s -> 49.92s]  We make sure we have two armed guards because, you know, just in case something goes wrong.
[49.92s -> 54.56s]  It's been such a long day at work. I just want to park my stupid forklift.
[60.93s -> 61.89s]  The joke is over.
[64.74s -> 65.24s]  Redo.
[66.18s -> 69.41s]  You cannot fit in here with this thing.
[69.41s -> 70.29s]  I'm getting in.
[71.74s -> 73.26s]  Oh my god, it's spazzing out.
[84.29s -> 90.74s]  You actually got it in the garage with a jump truck.
[91.94s -> 93.54s]  How are you gonna get out?
[95.54s -> 96.98s]  It's gonna explode.
[98.90s -> 100.10s]  Don't let it explode.
[102.30s -> 103.34s]  I can't fix it.
[104.94s -> 107.74s]  I don't know how you got in here. You killed M.
[111.31s -> 114.03s]  Oh my god, the laws of physics.
[123.60s -> 125.20s]  Come on, do something.
[133.55s -> 136.91s]  Lady, lady, that was not a good place for cover.
[138.22s -> 142.48s]  Crouching on the sidewalk was not a good place.
[143.87s -> 145.39s]  Look at this dipshit.
[149.95s -> 150.99s]  Oh, I'm gonna get him.
[161.09s -> 162.13s]  I tried, it didn't work.
[162.13s -> 179.26s]  All right, try to get in here again.
[179.26s -> 181.34s]  Where the hell did the helicopter come from?
[188.93s -> 191.01s]  This is not designed for this to happen.
[194.06s -> 195.34s]  You almost saved me because...
[197.90s -> 198.94s]  Okay, into the sky.
[199.98s -> 202.30s]  Into the sky with you.
[204.32s -> 206.00s]  Into the sky.
[206.00s -> 207.36s]  What the fuck?
[207.36s -> 211.54s]  This guy got you on the ear.
[212.10s -> 214.94s]  He got you on the balls.
[216.30s -> 219.26s]  This guy is taking so many bullets.
[221.79s -> 224.59s]  This guy is getting so ripped apart by bullets.
[226.83s -> 228.43s]  Now he runs, oh, because you're here.
[228.99s -> 230.59s]  I just want to be with Star.
[232.83s -> 234.59s]  Hey, Cobbs, remember how you were really mad at me?
[236.27s -> 240.90s]  Oh, hi, sir.
[240.90s -> 248.06s]  Weren't we just like shooting at you a quarter of a second ago?
[248.06s -> 250.14s]  This guy's kicking the shit out of me, by the way.
[250.14s -> 251.02s]  Can I come back you up?
[251.98s -> 252.86s]  You're gonna have to.
[252.86s -> 253.58s]  He's gonna kill me.
[258.58s -> 259.08s]  Me.
[263.47s -> 264.67s]  This guy still wants to fight you.
[264.67s -> 267.39s]  This guy is a maniac.
[267.39s -> 270.05s]  Oh, not anymore.
[270.05s -> 272.59s]  You gave him diarrhea.
[272.59s -> 274.11s]  Oh, I've got diarrhea.
[274.11s -> 275.87s]  Oh, give me to a bathroom.
[275.87s -> 278.83s]  Oh, I've given...
[278.83s -> 280.11s]  Jerma, look at me.
[280.11s -> 281.79s]  I've been given too much power.
[281.79s -> 282.75s]  I know how to do this.
[285.06s -> 285.30s]  What?
[285.30s -> 285.78s]  I'm dead.
[287.90s -> 288.46s]  I'm dead.
[288.46s -> 289.26s]  I'm alive though.
[290.80s -> 291.92s]  It's doing that thing again.
[292.88s -> 295.28s]  It's doing the thing where I'm dead, but I'm not dead.
[296.42s -> 297.78s]  I just got up and...
[297.94s -> 300.18s]  I'm just getting a silly shot again.
[301.78s -> 303.38s]  Dude, what is...
[303.38s -> 304.82s]  Please, let me get...
[314.38s -> 315.34s]  Jerma, get up.
[315.98s -> 317.02s]  Jerma, get up.
[319.10s -> 319.60s]  Help me.
[320.70s -> 321.20s]  Help.
[326.51s -> 327.01s]  I...
[327.31s -> 327.81s]  Help.
[328.83s -> 329.39s]  Move me.
[329.39s -> 329.95s]  Push me.
[329.95s -> 330.51s]  Do anything.
[331.39s -> 335.07s]  I'm not sure you're on the same place, like on the same screen as me.
[335.63s -> 337.63s]  Where are you laying?
[338.59s -> 341.63s]  I'm lying next to this cop car that you're rolling into.
[343.06s -> 344.98s]  I'm lying just on the ground right here.
[346.42s -> 348.58s]  I'm just getting riddled with bullets.
[349.14s -> 349.78s]  Yeah, I'm dead.
[350.50s -> 351.38s]  The same thing happened.
[352.18s -> 355.79s]  And I kept on getting up and getting lit up again.
[357.33s -> 359.57s]  Okay, that was ridiculous.
