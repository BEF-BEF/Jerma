[5.62s -> 12.10s]  Hey, what's happening, everybody? Jerma here with a gameplay commentary on Hand of Fate,
[12.10s -> 18.18s]  a recently released game on Steam. And it's fun. And I kind of just want to talk about it. This is
[18.18s -> 21.86s]  going to be one of those videos where I just kind of talk about a game, this one in particular.
[22.42s -> 27.06s]  And here we go. So what is Hand of Fate? You're watching right now, you probably have no idea,
[27.06s -> 31.10s]  or maybe you do, because a lot of people have been starting to talk about it more recently.
[31.10s -> 38.20s]  It's a deck building RPG hybrid Arkham Asylum rogue-like board game.
[39.40s -> 45.56s]  Whoa, how dare you try to convince me that that many genres will work in a game? That is absurd
[45.56s -> 50.12s]  and disgusting and I hope you get killed. I'm out of here. I'm leaving. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[50.12s -> 54.60s]  You just threw your fucking drink at me. Hold on a second. Hey, hey, hey. I'm not going to convince
[54.60s -> 60.04s]  me. Stop. Just listen to me for a second. Okay. What do you want? Make it quick. The reason why
[60.04s -> 65.80s]  the game is so much fun is because it is the experience you have. You make a deck and you
[65.80s -> 71.80s]  fight your- Oh, please tell me. That's what I thought. Good day, I'm leaving. No, no, no, no.
[72.84s -> 81.14s]  It's just hard to put into words why the game's fun. You're ugly. He's gone. But that's the problem
[81.14s -> 86.07s]  that I have with Hand of Fate. I've been sitting here trying to come up with how I'm going to
[86.07s -> 91.05s]  explain how this game works or what this game is for at least probably 40 minutes. I've been
[91.05s -> 94.97s]  sitting here. I don't know. How do you explain this game to somebody that doesn't know what it is?
[95.78s -> 102.10s]  Because at its core, it doesn't have a core. It's got so many things going on that you can't say
[102.10s -> 107.54s]  it's one or the other. If I tell you this is a card game, that's not true. That's not entirely
[107.54s -> 111.94s]  true because you're watching me brawl guys with an axe and bury it into their chests. This is
[111.94s -> 116.89s]  not a card game that you're watching right now. This is a brawler. If you were to walk in and you
[116.89s -> 121.85s]  had no idea what this game was and you came in at two separate intervals and you saw this
[121.85s -> 126.63s]  on the first time and this on the second time, you might think this is two entirely different
[126.63s -> 131.50s]  games. And it kind of is. On one hand, you have the deck building and on the other hand,
[131.50s -> 136.86s]  you have the combat. And as easy as I can put this, as simple as I can explain this in like
[136.86s -> 142.38s]  three sentences or less, you unlock cards by playing through the game and achieving certain
[142.38s -> 148.70s]  goals. You then take those cards and make a deck, which then you traverse on a game board
[149.34s -> 154.38s]  and fight your own deck and permadeath. If you lose, you have to start from the beginning of
[154.38s -> 159.42s]  the level again and maybe do some deck modifications. Hope that made sense.
[160.44s -> 164.68s]  And the confusion that sets in when you initially see somebody play this game. I saw somebody
[164.68s -> 169.80s]  stream this game a long time ago and I thought to myself, what am I even watching? What the
[169.80s -> 175.40s]  fuck is this guy doing? I don't even, I don't like this. I don't like it. I actually ended up
[175.40s -> 181.80s]  installing the game and playing for like 15 minutes before I gave up. And you can't do that
[181.80s -> 188.60s]  with this game. This game's tutorial is not only very easy, it's not the whole game. It's not the
[188.60s -> 193.64s]  point of the game. And I jumped in wanting something immediately and I got overwhelmed
[193.64s -> 199.54s]  with everything and had no idea what was going on. And part of me is glad that I didn't give it a
[199.54s -> 204.10s]  chance back when it was in early access and I didn't really start to play it till right now
[204.10s -> 209.86s]  because it's done now. It's released. It is 1.0. It is no longer in early access. So I get to
[209.86s -> 216.46s]  experience the game that was intended to be played at the initial conception of the game.
[216.46s -> 219.90s]  And besides the game, besides the gameplay, besides what I've been talking about so far,
[220.82s -> 227.40s]  my favorite part about this title is the fact that it was on early access and it released and
[227.40s -> 234.60s]  it's good. That alone is enough to make me happy because we've seen in the past so many early access
[234.60s -> 240.28s]  games that kind of just get stuck in limbo. Some of them are like abandoned almost entirely.
[240.28s -> 245.72s]  So it's refreshing to see a title like this in just over one year's development time after
[245.72s -> 253.56s]  being funded on Kickstarter for $55,000 by the way, which by industry standards is a handful of
[253.56s -> 257.56s]  quarters at this point in the state of the industry. But it's great to see that. It's
[257.56s -> 260.76s]  great to see it actually releasing, coming out and people enjoying it. And it's a fun game.
[260.76s -> 266.50s]  And I think my most enjoyment from this game comes from the choose your own adventure aspect
[266.50s -> 271.38s]  that it has in it. Because like I said, you unlock cards. When you unlock cards in this game,
[271.38s -> 277.62s]  you don't know what they do. You have to physically put them in your deck and run into them RNG on the
[277.62s -> 283.62s]  game board before you even know what they do. And some of them are very clever. You'll run into them
[283.62s -> 288.18s]  thinking you know how it's going to play out. But in fact, this vampire wanted to suck your blood
[288.18s -> 292.98s]  for money. And you have to make that decision because health is a resource. Food is a resource.
[292.98s -> 298.50s]  Every single time you take a step on the game board, you lose one food. And it's jumbling all
[298.50s -> 304.30s]  these resources and managing them or mismanaging them like I do very frequently when I play,
[304.30s -> 310.06s]  makes it an interesting dynamic because you kind of like to lose as much as you like to win.
[310.06s -> 316.04s]  My enjoyment does stem from finding these cards that I've never seen before and watching the
[316.04s -> 322.20s]  interesting story of the card play out in front of me. So hopefully you've gotten some type of
[322.20s -> 327.88s]  coherent message from this video. And the game currently right now is sitting at $20 because of
[327.88s -> 334.04s]  its launch sale. And I think it's going to go to 25 when it's all said and done after the wholesale
[334.04s -> 336.84s]  thing. But that's gonna wrap it up guys. Just wanted to give a little bit of a quick shout
[336.84s -> 340.04s]  to the game because I thought it was really fun. And that's gonna wrap it up.
