[0.06s -> 13.68s]  Quick Draw! Fast Draw! It's a cowboy's world in the Wild West. Which one has the skills
[13.68s -> 23.60s]  to pay the bills? In this week's episode installment of... Fast Draw! Showdown! Only on the Nintendo
[23.60s -> 24.60s]  Wii!
[24.60s -> 39.74s]  Really? This fucking dweeb is going to shoot me? I don't think so, Larry. I just like tased
[39.74s -> 50.14s]  that guy. That guy got hit with a taser. That wasn't a bullet. Watch out for the actors.
[50.14s -> 58.22s]  Get away from the actors that run by from stage left. See you later. I died at that...
[58.22s -> 70.50s]  What the what? Are you serious? I shot that guy like so many times? Why is that lady smiling?
[70.50s -> 75.00s]  Why would you ever be smiling in that situation? That's not like a fun situation to be in.
[75.16s -> 79.64s]  There's two guys about to have a duel with a pistol and this lady is like smiling as
[79.64s -> 111.07s]  if she's in a wedding photo. This guy's shit faced so he'll be easy. That sucked! I'm planning
[111.07s -> 126.53s]  on it. Did he just not even shoot the gun? Is it in the book? It's in the book! I knew
[126.53s -> 146.42s]  it was in the book! I knew it was in the fucking book and now I lost and it's over.
[146.42s -> 156.49s]  Top quality acting job, lady. Which one is it? Is it one of the guys playing cards? That
[156.49s -> 162.55s]  was a giant cartoon bag of money. Seriously, she ran out of there with a Scrooge McDuck
[162.55s -> 168.47s]  bag. You're not going to fool me. What about this guy? That guy had no idea what the fuck
[168.59s -> 185.26s]  was going on. That guy missed. That guy shot the ground. That guy shot directly into the
[185.26s -> 195.84s]  dirt. Why is that guy a quick draw fast McGraw? That doesn't make any sense. I have no idea
[195.84s -> 212.34s]  what this guy just said. She's going to be quick. Oh, not quick enough. You see that
[212.34s -> 220.64s]  mattress behind her? That's like a stunt mattress. I'm glad you fell on that stunt
[220.64s -> 244.42s]  mattress inside of a saloon. You can't tell somebody to holster the gun and then shoot.
[244.42s -> 248.50s]  She just told me to holster. Come on now. Holster that gun. I thought we were going
[248.50s -> 270.96s]  to play fair and no, of course not. You mean business. You can't be serious right now.
[270.96s -> 275.40s]  I was too busy paying attention to his dancing. I knew it was going to happen. I just had
[275.40s -> 284.94s]  to watch him dance. That was... Oh my God. This is so hard. Cause like the Wiimote, like
[284.94s -> 290.14s]  when you bring the Wiimote up, it's like, how am I ever supposed to do this with my
[290.14s -> 316.76s]  like shaky ass hands? Here we go. I lose. I'm done. It's just too hard. I've already
[316.76s -> 319.88s]  killed this guy, but you know what? We're going to cheat. I'm just going to shoot the
[319.88s -> 321.80s]  guy right now.
