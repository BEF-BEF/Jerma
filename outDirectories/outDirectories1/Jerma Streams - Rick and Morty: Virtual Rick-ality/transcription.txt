[0.76s -> 7.42s]  Okay, so the next one I'm gonna move to, and I'm only gonna... I'm like drained already.
[8.46s -> 11.66s]  The next one I'm moving to is probably gonna have this, but just about 5,000 people here.
[13.42s -> 26.82s]  Probably about, probably 1,600 of you are gonna leave. I'll show you why. I saw it on
[26.82s -> 31.38s]  Steam, I had to buy it, even though it's probably gonna be terrible. I don't know, it might be
[31.38s -> 52.74s]  good. No, it's not Picross VR. Take a snapshot, okay? I'm serious. How many people are here
[52.74s -> 69.11s]  right now versus how many people are here in five minutes? Okay, let's see. Opening it now.
[73.35s -> 78.63s]  Change the title. Why? It says my own reality, playing games and demos. That's what we're
[78.63s -> 107.06s]  doing. Get out of Minecraft. Okay, and here we go. I apologize everybody, but it had to be done.
[132.04s -> 161.88s]  This is Rick and Morty of Virtual Rick-ality. Can you guys even see this? All right, I'm
[161.88s -> 183.51s]  ready now for a Rick and Morty. Look at that tension. How do I do anything? What do I do?
[183.51s -> 189.86s]  This is, this is, this is really awful. You couldn't make this quote out of fucking Jello
[189.86s -> 217.74s]  or something. Big disc. Do Rick's laundry. That's unplayable. And no, I don't mean the
[217.74s -> 234.46s]  game. I mean the headset. You wanna see a fucking magic trick? Oh shit! I probably just
[234.46s -> 251.05s]  made everybody throw. I'm so sorry. I have to sit here and let this unwind. Oh my god.
[251.37s -> 266.20s]  It's so tight back here. How does it even get like this? All right, let it spin. Come on,
[266.20s -> 285.54s]  let's go. Get in! There. There we go. Now I can spin. I physically couldn't even turn it.
[288.09s -> 301.42s]  Bunched up. Finally. My god. Can have, take like a powder break. Someone has to come
[301.42s -> 322.57s]  in here and powder my face, untangle my cord. That's fun. It is though. This is way too
[322.57s -> 335.46s]  fucking loud. All right, here we go. All right, let's come back. I'm sorry if I made
[335.46s -> 369.62s]  you almost throw up there, because I almost did too. Okay, do Rick's laundry. Hey,
[369.62s -> 394.01s]  look, we're ready to play a video game. Let's go. Rick and Morty. Okay. Can't wait to
[394.01s -> 419.78s]  hear more like made up words. Why am I playing this? Because this is my out.
[420.60s -> 429.62s]  Because this is my way out. Minecraft VR, I'm out of gas and this is my way out.
[430.26s -> 435.88s]  You'll be begging me to turn the stream off in about 20 minutes.
[445.34s -> 446.70s]  It's me, Morty!
[463.00s -> 465.48s]  You'll see I wrote instructions on what you're supposed to do.
[466.44s -> 473.61s]  This looks like when the Simpsons went into 3D and it looked weird. Okay.
[476.70s -> 477.34s]  How do I move?
[485.58s -> 497.86s]  You can drink. You want some? Right in your fucking eyes. Oh, look at this. It's
[497.86s -> 503.46s]  our dirty underwear! Oh, what the fuck? How do I move?
[512.42s -> 523.38s]  I don't know how to move. Morty, how do I move?
[539.16s -> 546.36s]  Dude, the physics engine fucking fell back. No, I'll take something. Oh,
[546.36s -> 548.36s]  okay, one. I thought I wanted me to put it in the...
[549.48s -> 577.22s]  Morty, listen to me. Listen to me, Morty. Morty, listen to me. I got it. I need that.
[577.22s -> 579.86s]  Your shot asides your blog from the Simpsons. I figured it out.
[580.82s -> 581.78s]  Lawsuit!
[618.39s -> 619.11s]  Do it again.
[633.43s -> 633.91s]  Thank you.
[646.87s -> 649.51s]  I'm gonna need you to grab the watch and put it on your wrist.
[649.51s -> 652.23s]  You'll be able to call me using the watch. This is very important.
[652.23s -> 658.95s]  All right, Morty clone? All right, Morty clone, we gotta go.
[658.95s -> 660.47s]  Don't touch any of my stuff while we're gone.
[661.11s -> 666.49s]  What's this one called? Rick, wait. I think I can figure it out.
[667.05s -> 672.25s]  That's the Schmeichel box. That's the Floggin' Flaggin' Blagger, right?
[673.66s -> 677.66s]  This is the Groobin' Grubbin' Globbaglover, right? Something like that.
[679.21s -> 721.88s]  Oh, and this is just a crown, Morty. Hey. Hey, I'm Mr. Basics.
[724.17s -> 757.69s]  Look at me. No. No, I didn't. No. What? Look at me. Everybody did that. Come on.
[761.34s -> 762.94s]  That was fucking actually kind of brutal.
[763.58s -> 769.08s]  Give me another one. Give me another one. Give me another one. Give me another one.
[769.08s -> 772.28s]  How many can I have? Let's say I have like five.
[772.92s -> 796.31s]  I can only have four. Okay, so what do you want to do?
[797.11s -> 807.29s]  What the fuck just happened? All right, so what do you want to do? Call me?
[829.62s -> 864.09s]  Got it. Throw it to me. What just happened? Like this. Like this.
[864.81s -> 886.81s]  Okay, what do you order me another one? I wasn't paying attention. I'm sorry.
[889.24s -> 897.64s]  Why did you die? All right, what does it want me to do?
[916.63s -> 934.71s]  What the fuck? That just makes you small? Okay. All right, give me something, right?
[934.71s -> 945.54s]  Give me an order something. What does it want me to do? Turn up the game audio.
[946.10s -> 957.83s]  It's already pretty high. Please don't. What did I have to do? He wanted me to...
[958.39s -> 968.01s]  I don't remember what he wanted me to do. Nitro dark matter.
[981.62s -> 983.94s]  No, you actually. All right, hold on.
[997.83s -> 1003.83s]  Okay, what was the actual goal? He said, uh, order me. Order me. What was it?
[1004.63s -> 1011.08s]  To use the phone.
[1025.62s -> 1050.04s]  Oh, what? Oh, it broke. Rick, your computer's broken.
[1065.35s -> 1078.79s]  RAM, CPU, GPU. Got it. Okay, RAM goes in there. What is this? Crystal. It's broken. And then,
[1078.87s -> 1090.82s]  fuse. Okay, use that to get fuse. Don't forget he has RAM. Okay, so don't forget he has RAM
[1090.82s -> 1110.06s]  down there and down here. That's carrots. You just spit that back into my mouth.
[1111.94s -> 1134.31s]  I need to make a carrot hammer. Carrot hammer. I can use that portal machine.
[1134.31s -> 1159.96s]  What was the portal machine for? Use to get fuse. Wow. We're looking at Earth.
[1166.49s -> 1179.67s]  I need to charge the battery. With what? With a Super Nintendo game? How about one of you?
[1200.04s -> 1209.88s]  All right, charge the battery. Charging station or something in here.
[1229.78s -> 1236.26s]  Can't pass the IQ gear check. I'm actually just exhausted for some reason.
[1236.66s -> 1315.58s]  I don't know why. Charge it. That's pretty close to Jerma's son. I did it. This is stressing
[1315.58s -> 1346.87s]  me out. Goodbye. I got a battery for you. Battery. Open. I got him. Two fuses. Done.
[1346.87s -> 1367.51s]  It's in. All right, now I need a crystal. And I need to make a fucking carrot.
[1368.63s -> 1375.21s]  A carrot thing. Or a weird apple. Metal apple. How the hell am I gonna make a metal apple?
[1375.69s -> 1413.27s]  Is it metal? Well, this is a crystal. Do both these. Thank you. Oh, he's eating both. All right.
[1417.08s -> 1443.45s]  That looks pretty good. Nope. Not right. I need something else. Screwdriver. Hammer. Hammer.
[1443.45s -> 1460.07s]  Look out. All right. IP. Rick and Morty's Rick-ality.
[1464.18s -> 1487.10s]  Boot it up. Now, what do I, what do you want to do with this? Rick?
[1536.86s -> 1560.98s]  Okay. Do I get to choose? Oh. I thought I was gonna get a drop down. Into the toilet.
[1560.98s -> 1606.20s]  Look. I'm just a baby right now. I'm not even talking. I'm just a baby playing with fucking toys.
[1615.42s -> 1661.70s]  All right. Got it. Plunge the toilet. What, now what? Oh, come on. What? Lactatives.
[1672.34s -> 1681.77s]  I need like a, something to fix the toilet. Here we go. This is the toilet fixer thing.
[1682.73s -> 1715.06s]  Rick, I don't know. Do I do it? What the fuck is this?
[1727.61s -> 1738.73s]  This. Okay. It's almond. Oh, they're back.
[1752.36s -> 1760.98s]  Sure thing, Rick. They didn't get it.
[1760.98s -> 1773.90s]  Why can't you just tell me right now?
[1804.82s -> 1809.30s]  So, we're, we're.
[1819.61s -> 1823.72s]  There's nothing in there. Can I wear this?
[1832.94s -> 1867.16s]  I don't want it on. Do I have to charge this thing in the? Oh, God. Really? I, this is gonna,
[1868.12s -> 1877.00s]  I have to, I have to end the stream after this one. I'm running out of fumes. I don't
[1877.00s -> 1917.50s]  know why. I'm so tired. Look at how long this takes though. The fate of the universe is in my
[1917.50s -> 1941.82s]  fucking hand. One fuck up and his whole thing, the whole planet goes down. Look. Where, where's it?
[1941.82s -> 1977.69s]  What? What happened? I didn't draw. Help diamond. Help the, on, come on. I actually have to get
[1977.69s -> 1987.72s]  out of the headset. After I plug in the fucking car, I think it's time for me to go.
[1988.52s -> 2005.70s]  This is, if you're a fan of the show, this is probably really cool. And yeah, I know this is
[2005.70s -> 2008.58s]  the, this is the other VR game I played today, but don't worry, we're gonna come back.
[2013.21s -> 2032.20s]  I can't fucking hear anything. It's got, you know, I can always tell when it's time for me to
[2032.20s -> 2041.18s]  stop. When the, my, I'm sweating so much inside of my ears that this thing won't stay in.
[2042.22s -> 2048.18s]  It's oiled inside of here. It's oily. And it just keeps falling off. That's how I know it's
[2048.18s -> 2078.66s]  not. Okay. I'm holding this. Now what? Let's get the repair kit.
[2085.32s -> 2103.99s]  Curl 40. How does this thing work? Let's go check it out over here. No, what?
[2112.33s -> 2118.73s]  Incorrect combination. Please try a little harder. I need to, I need a match. So I green to green.
[2120.01s -> 2139.48s]  You're at green. It's only one match. It's a lift. Watch out. No more than five bands total.
[2140.28s -> 2174.15s]  No more than one blue and at least two reds. No. Do you call that fuckery? So there's one
[2174.15s -> 2182.44s]  red and here's two. I can't, at least one link with no duplicate colors. So that's this one.
[2183.85s -> 2193.19s]  No more than five bands total. One, two, three, four, five. And it's got, okay,
[2193.19s -> 2203.08s]  there's code zone here too. Hold on. One link ending in a number and one ending in a letter.
[2203.08s -> 2237.37s]  Oh my God. I need to like see what the, all right. So one has to end in a number,
[2237.37s -> 2271.35s]  one has to end in a letter. You got yellow, yellow, six, five, I'm done. Oh, oh my God.
[2271.35s -> 2279.10s]  I'm so tired. Did you enjoy your stay? I, Minecraft VR was really cool. That was cool too.
[2279.10s -> 2292.63s]  I'm just completely out of fucking steam. I just got nothing in tech. Oh, it's been,
[2292.63s -> 2295.99s]  yeah, this, this usually is when it happens around like four and a half hours,
[2295.99s -> 2319.91s]  just about like four to five hours. Oh yeah. How bad do I look today? Oh, all right. So
[2323.83s -> 2336.46s]  cold, but no, no cold right now. I look like fucking somebody diarrhea all over me,
[2336.46s -> 2345.58s]  but that's going to be it. I will see you guys. I'll see you guys in a few days because I'm
[2345.58s -> 2350.81s]  going to take the next few days off. I've got some things to take care of. I got some friends
[2350.81s -> 2358.15s]  that came up, so I'm going to see them for a little while. I'll see you guys real soon.
[2359.35s -> 2370.78s]  We'll do the bits. And as much as like the, I was taking the piss on the Minecraft thing,
[2370.78s -> 2376.46s]  but it was actually really, really cool. And it doesn't cost me anything either. That mod is free.
[2384.14s -> 2390.89s]  I usually, I typically like to go a little bit longer, but no, I got nothing. I'm not going
[2390.89s -> 2399.32s]  to pretend I do, you know? Anyways, let's go through the bits. Thank you for joining me,
[2399.32s -> 2412.70s]  everybody. When I get back, we got, I'll be back on probably Wednesday is when the next
[2412.70s -> 2418.46s]  stream will be. So Wednesday afternoon, we'll be back. Joel and I are going to do our
[2420.04s -> 2425.16s]  gamer competition in Pogo Stuck, Pogo Stick, whatever it's called, Pogo Stuck Rage,
[2425.16s -> 2436.46s]  Pogo Stick Rage. Joel, as in Varg Skeletor. I don't know if that's going to happen on
[2436.46s -> 2441.22s]  Wednesday, but we'll be talking back and forth about it. So we'll see. That's going
[2441.22s -> 2446.02s]  to happen probably next week if we can get our schedules correct. Five community subs,
[2446.02s -> 2452.62s]  thank you so much. That just came in right now. Those came in from Bingo Sunshine. Thank you so
[2452.62s -> 2457.18s]  much. That's a shitload of community subs. People give a lot of community subs on this channel.
[2461.53s -> 2469.91s]  Every stream is at least like 50. It's insane. But yeah, then there's more. I want to do
[2469.91s -> 2474.23s]  mine show, but that's going to be a whole stream. I really did not expect Minecraft VR
[2474.23s -> 2482.62s]  to take up three and a half hours of this stream, but it did somehow. But there are
[2482.62s -> 2489.51s]  plenty of things lined up. If you're taking off, I'll see you soon. See you on Wednesday.
[2490.15s -> 2498.50s]  Much love to you. And let's go back to the Cremator. Cremator a few hours ago gave five
[2498.50s -> 2510.98s]  dollars. Jerma, I see your place in memecraft. Good job. Oh, and I played. Oh, is this the
[2510.98s -> 2522.01s]  fire dude again? All right. Well, good luck. I don't, I've already said five piece. Thank
[2522.01s -> 2533.75s]  you for the five dollars though. Thank you. Alf the librarian for the five dollars. My
[2533.75s -> 2547.46s]  library filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy. That's not good. Your library data. Sorry to hear that.
[2548.10s -> 2552.18s]  We're liquidating our library because chat stormed in and bought all the good books.
[2554.92s -> 2563.75s]  Well, at least chat has some reading material. No. Hey, dork cube. Thanks for the 250.
[2565.19s -> 2567.99s]  Can't watch the stream right now, but I just want to say thank you for being a man of
[2567.99s -> 2574.78s]  your word. Even if chat kind of sort of cheated at pick Ross. I told you guys I was going to do
[2574.78s -> 2591.67s]  it. I'm a man of my word sometimes. I like to be a man of my word all the time. I try. Hey,
[2591.67s -> 2595.75s]  snoozing copter. Thanks for the 250 snoozing copter. Every time Jerma plays minecraft,
[2595.75s -> 2601.75s]  he gets the rarest spawns. I think I don't keep up with minecraft is the ocean thing
[2601.75s -> 2607.75s]  rare. But minecraft actually is kind of fun. I should play it again. Nevermind. What I
[2607.75s -> 2612.63s]  wanted to ask, I have trouble gaining weight. I'm 21, Jerma. I know you've struggled with
[2612.63s -> 2618.39s]  that too in the past. Or maybe you still do. Any advice? You even got the calorie drinks.
[2618.39s -> 2622.23s]  Careful with the calorie drinks. Those, they've got a lot of like mouth of dextrin in them,
[2622.23s -> 2632.74s]  which is just heavy sugar bullshit. They're full of almost cake batter. But when I was
[2632.74s -> 2637.62s]  working out when I actually cared about lifting and trying to be physically fit and all that
[2638.58s -> 2643.26s]  years ago, just, you just got to eat, especially if you have like a lightning
[2643.26s -> 2649.19s]  metabolism like I do. You just kind of have to, you have to eat high calorie foods,
[2649.19s -> 2654.47s]  but a good, you don't, you don't want to just dump empty calories in your body. You'll get
[2654.47s -> 2661.75s]  fat. You'll gain weight that you don't want if you eat, you know, 50, 60, 80 grams of
[2661.75s -> 2671.48s]  saturated fat. You could eat a whole pizza every day and you'd gain weight, but you'd,
[2672.28s -> 2681.83s]  it would be bad. It would be all over the place. But yeah, I eat a lot of tuna fish.
[2681.83s -> 2689.74s]  You have to really like it though. And I don't really, I'm not sure if like the medical
[2689.74s -> 2700.86s]  science there would tell you to eat a bunch of tuna anymore, but I wish you luck. It's a
[2700.86s -> 2734.81s]  journey. What are you doing? Skrillex tweeted you. What? Hold on, is this Skrillex?
[2735.93s -> 2750.92s]  The giant rat that makes all the rules. This is a real account? Why did you, why is this,
[2753.08s -> 2756.86s]  or is it weird that I automatically assume his account got hacked?
[2761.62s -> 2769.29s]  Like that, is that real? Wow. That's kind of, that's kind of crazy. I did. That's,
[2770.09s -> 2785.83s]  he's a fan. Well, if you're watching this Skrillex, that's high. That's,
[2785.91s -> 2792.06s]  I did not think I was going to get up in the morning and see that Skrillex has a tweet of the
[2792.06s -> 2810.02s]  rats song, but yeah, cool. Very cool. But anyway, respond to the tweet. Yeah, maybe later I'll like
[2810.90s -> 2823.05s]  do something, a reply or something. That's wild. Anyway, let's get, let's keep going with the
[2823.05s -> 2834.63s]  bits. Uh, door cube says, I can't want, thank you to the 250 door cube. Can't watch the
[2834.63s -> 2837.75s]  stream right now, but I just want to say thank you for being a man of your word. I just read
[2837.75s -> 2846.62s]  this. That's how slow I am right now. I am on, I, I am like, pull it up to the fucking gas
[2846.62s -> 2862.09s]  station, but that was snoozing copter and door cube. Uh, thank you code man for the 250.
[2863.75s -> 2866.71s]  Thanks code man. Be honest. You're, but you shower in your swim trunks, don't you?
[2869.50s -> 2879.21s]  No, I don't. I shower naked like every normal human being. Thank you. Zero giblets
[2879.21s -> 2884.57s]  for the bits. Thank you for screaming like the judge from Roger Rabbit being dipped when you
[2884.57s -> 2894.68s]  fell in the lava. Who showers naked? I'm going to take a bath today. That's what I'm doing.
[2896.66s -> 2911.19s]  Somebody said, look at the comments on that, on that thread. What is that fucking image?
[2913.22s -> 2930.63s]  What is that like third image down? It's just, which one? The one of my face with
[2931.11s -> 2938.42s]  teeth stretched out and my face squished in. Show, show. I mean, here's the tweet. Just go,
[2938.42s -> 2951.94s]  just look down. But thank you. Thank you some guy for the five bucks. And it's a,
[2952.74s -> 2957.75s]  it's a YouTube link. I'm back for the first time in forever with another meme video.
[2958.39s -> 2962.15s]  I'm still too lazy to edit together an actual good Phantom meme. So here's another place
[2962.15s -> 2968.63s]  holder. I actually have to change so I can see this. It's going through the vibe still.
[2969.59s -> 2980.14s]  And make it so it's coming through the actual desktop and not the headphones on the bind.
[2981.74s -> 2994.02s]  You guys are fucking, you guys are fucking too much. How's that? Can I hear? I can hear now.
[2994.02s -> 3007.02s]  I say can, can you hear though? That's important. Speakers. There they are. Testing.
[3007.02s -> 3013.94s]  There we go. All right. So this is a meme video. I wonder what kind of meme it is.
[3014.82s -> 3036.26s]  There's this dog, dog them style T-Rex. Is that, I don't,
[3047.42s -> 3053.67s]  somebody came in and said, did he play nothing but Minecraft? The unfortunate answer is yes.
[3058.34s -> 3063.46s]  And then I played Rick and Morty. I thought Rick, I, oh, how many people left during that?
[3063.46s -> 3082.90s]  I wanted to have five minutes later, like 200, about 200. I can't believe like this
[3083.70s -> 3093.59s]  four or five thousand fucking people. That's, you guys are two kinds. Seriously. But thank
[3093.59s -> 3101.88s]  you for the meme video some guy. Thank you. Oh, we have a Jane Dole Walken,
[3101.88s -> 3110.18s]  $15 from Jane Dole Walken. They say making evil meals, making evil meals.
[3110.82s -> 3121.02s]  I'm not sure that's a reference to, but thank you, Jane Dole Walken. End the stream
[3121.02s -> 3130.65s]  so I can watch the VOD faster. Not much longer. We're only going to get a few more.
[3130.65s -> 3137.13s]  And by a few more, I mean like 10 maybe. Here we go. Jerma lied about Minecraft VR,
[3137.13s -> 3148.14s]  gave $10 and they say, first of all, thank you for the $10. I ain't changing it. You lied
[3148.14s -> 3154.38s]  somehow. I just don't know how yet. Upon further investigation, you did not reenact
[3154.38s -> 3161.24s]  JermaCraft The Adventure Begins episode one. You paraphrased it at best. I called the police to
[3161.24s -> 3174.36s]  ask and they said you lied. I, how am I supposed to memorize the entire first three minutes of that
[3174.36s -> 3188.01s]  video? I've seen it. I, I know it kind of. Half of chat has it memorized. You lived it.
[3196.15s -> 3203.08s]  Yeah, I lived it. I didn't see lots of fails. I didn't say lots of fails, lots of triumphs.
[3204.58s -> 3211.32s]  That's not good. But thank you, Jerma lied about Minecraft for the $10 and for the
[3212.20s -> 3224.86s]  community subs as well. Thank you. Thank you. Al the chemist, Al the chemist for the $3. Hey
[3224.86s -> 3227.74s]  man, I'm pretty fucking drunk right now, but just want to let you know that I think you're
[3227.74s -> 3231.90s]  an incredibly funny and interesting person and you bring me such joy when you stream.
[3233.02s -> 3235.58s]  Thank God you stream later now. I can actually watch your stuff.
[3236.38s -> 3241.58s]  LOL. I'll send more bits later because I bought the 500 pack, but next time the message will
[3241.58s -> 3247.74s]  be less coherent because I'm still drinking. We'll fuck. Let's see. We'll see. That's Al
[3247.74s -> 3258.18s]  the chemist. That was about two hours ago. Thank you so much. I'm honored that you think
[3258.18s -> 3267.00s]  that I'm interesting. Thank you as always. Thank you so much. He's drunk so he doesn't
[3267.00s -> 3272.68s]  mean it. No, he's drunk. So he does mean it. That's the reverse of what you're talking
[3272.68s -> 3279.96s]  about. Uh, Freudian weapon gave $10. They said this stream made it makes me really
[3279.96s -> 3284.76s]  want to pick my Minecraft back up again. Good way to de-stress. Yeah, we caught that
[3284.76s -> 3293.80s]  one earlier, but it's true. You can't really just hang out and hit some trees. I had it.
[3293.80s -> 3297.08s]  That was, I thought this was a great, this is a good stream. I liked just kind of
[3297.08s -> 3302.22s]  experiencing that again, even though I wish I could have done it a little longer,
[3302.22s -> 3310.58s]  maybe go and explore some more, but it was scary in VR. It was good. It was a lot of
[3310.58s -> 3317.93s]  fun. Highly recommend it. And if you have a Vi that's free, the VR portion at least.
[3321.61s -> 3329.90s]  Al the chemist, an hour later than his first message. Thank you for the, I mean, this is
[3329.90s -> 3334.86s]  under the bit minimum here, but I'm curious. I need to know. This is the second cheer from
[3334.86s -> 3340.86s]  my drunk Memei. Dude, I hope you had fun. Minecraft is def a game that has its merits.
[3340.86s -> 3345.18s]  Hope you give a modded Minecraft to try sometime. That'd be cool. Have a good night.
[3347.66s -> 3355.22s]  That's, no, that's, that's very coherent actually. Now under the bit reading about
[3356.18s -> 3369.21s]  unbelievable. No, it's not like one of a, it's not like, I don't like Minecraft. I give it
[3369.21s -> 3375.18s]  shit, but you know, I'm just kidding around. Oh, it's a kid's game. No, it's an any,
[3375.18s -> 3380.12s]  anybody can enjoy that experience. I'm just fucking around. I hope you know that guys.
[3380.84s -> 3388.78s]  And now he's backtracking. That's, I'm the master of backtracking. I say something
[3388.78s -> 3393.10s]  and then I think, eh, probably shouldn't have said it four hours later. I go, Hey, by the way,
[3393.66s -> 3408.01s]  but thank you Al the chemist. Thank you smelly boy for the 250. This is actually horrible.
[3408.01s -> 3415.74s]  Please go back to Minecraft. Was it Rick and Morty? Was it the Rick and Morty game?
[3416.54s -> 3423.74s]  They probably should have just stayed in Minecraft for another 30 to 40 minutes and
[3423.74s -> 3438.42s]  do the whole four, four and a half hours in Minecraft. No, I blame part of that on me
[3439.38s -> 3450.23s]  because I wasn't really talking. It wasn't really saying much. Blasted. When I get tired,
[3450.23s -> 3466.17s]  when I, you know, start to slow down, I shut off and just, what's that? Oh, okay. Yeah.
[3466.17s -> 3476.89s]  And that's why I decided it's like, it's probably time to stop. Demonic cucumber. Thank
[3476.89s -> 3485.98s]  you. They say I witnessed one of the rarest events in the game. Lightning will randomly
[3485.98s -> 3505.05s]  spawn maybe a skeleton trap horse with a chance of 0.75 to 1.5% chance on easy. It's a, wow,
[3505.69s -> 3514.70s]  and I got four at once. And there's a 1.5 to 4% chance on normal and a 6.7% chance
[3514.70s -> 3520.70s]  or 2.8% chance on hard. On top of that, skeleton horses have the rarest spawn rates,
[3520.70s -> 3524.54s]  making the chances of you seeing that less than 1%. In fact, I'd wager that you are
[3524.54s -> 3530.30s]  the first person to ever experience that on a VR live stream. You've literally become
[3530.30s -> 3545.35s]  a part of Minecraft history. All right. Hey, it was crazy. That's why I didn't want to just,
[3545.35s -> 3552.89s]  I was going to move on after I got out of the dungeon. And then what did he do?
[3553.45s -> 3564.90s]  I got on the horse and I rode it for a little bit. I died a few times. And then the first,
[3564.90s -> 3571.40s]  the last stream, I got a woodland mansion on spawn. Why is your Minecraft, why is your luck so good?
[3572.20s -> 3580.09s]  Didn't you guys ever hear the character sheet that Star made for me? I've said it before.
[3581.69s -> 3599.59s]  10 charisma, 10 luck, zero in every single other category. I would say I have,
[3599.59s -> 3609.83s]  I got to give myself at least a few points in strength. You know, I'm not just going to have
[3609.83s -> 3626.71s]  zero strength, but I don't know. Sometimes there's, I don't know how. 2012.
[3629.11s -> 3637.42s]  Seven strength, two intelligence. What is the intelligence point level for at least an eighth
[3637.42s -> 3645.48s]  grader? I have an, at least an eighth to 10th grade intelligence to give me some credit.
[3650.79s -> 3655.51s]  Four, I'll take a four or five and it are apps. Definitely. I'll take a four or five
[3655.51s -> 3666.82s]  in intelligence. Anything below eight is an animal, is animal level. What? But if that is true,
[3666.82s -> 3675.78s]  if that really was one of the rarest Minecraft events you could ever see, I, that's cool.
[3675.78s -> 3683.27s]  I'm happy to have been able to show it then. Hey the Jack, thanks for the $5. Everyone in
[3683.27s -> 3699.96s]  chat only hates the Rick and Morty VR because of their low IQ scores. Rick and Morty. Thank
[3699.96s -> 3718.97s]  you. Get dunked on. Hey Jerma, I did a rat's mashup. Really hope you like it. Rats mashup.
[3727.30s -> 3728.26s]  This sounds elaborate.
[3751.98s -> 3760.49s]  I'll just show it. Might as well just put it on the screen, right?
[3786.84s -> 3803.27s]  This is the gentleman of the jury.
[3807.91s -> 3809.35s]  What is hard for others?
[3809.35s -> 3823.62s]  I'm sure you'll get it. Speed it up. Speed it up.
[3842.02s -> 3851.32s]  Special day. Shut up idiot. Come on Michael, you ruin your fucking birthday every year for
[3851.32s -> 3856.90s]  everybody else. That we get it. It's my birthday today. Not anybody else's. It's my birthday.
[3856.90s -> 3860.74s]  Calm down. Do you hear what they just said? Now hold on just a second. Pause the movie.
[3860.74s -> 3865.80s]  Hip-hop. Just dance together as a family for once.
[3866.44s -> 3872.44s]  Rats. Rats. We are the rats. Celebrate another one of our big backs. Michael, it's your birthday today.
[3872.44s -> 3876.87s]  Take it actually. We are the rats. Michael, it's your birthday today.
[3876.87s -> 3878.33s]  Come on then. It's your birthday today.
[3878.33s -> 3880.49s]  Which is iPod conversion.
[3880.49s -> 3892.41s]  Rats. Rats. Celebrate another one of our big backs. Michael, it's your birthday today.
[3892.41s -> 3898.44s]  Welcome to the dog camp. Trust you're all right.
[3898.44s -> 3901.80s]  In that case, walk away.
[3901.80s -> 3903.40s]  It's pretty good filler content, yeah.
[3903.40s -> 3905.32s]  I'm waiting for you shit to find a dirty toothbrush.
[3905.40s -> 3907.32s]  This is just to make sure you understand the story.
[3924.62s -> 3926.62s]  What is this voice for this character by the way?
[3942.26s -> 3944.34s]  I know exactly who we can sell these to.
[3944.58s -> 3949.46s]  Rats. Rats. We are the rats. Celebrate another one of our big backs. Michael, it's your birthday today.
[3949.46s -> 3972.34s]  Wait, what's this? Who's this in the car? What TV show is this?
[3973.30s -> 3978.57s]  It's fucking birthday every year for everybody else.
[3978.57s -> 4003.02s]  We get it. I went through so much trouble to get you these rats.
[4003.02s -> 4023.11s]  Wow. Shocking. That's a real shock right there. That was ridiculous. That was very, very,
[4023.11s -> 4036.14s]  very good. Thank you so much for that. That was very well put together. That was get dunked on,
[4036.14s -> 4054.17s]  by the way. It was absolutely perfect. Thank you so much. Get dunked on. Glad we got to see it on
[4054.17s -> 4062.30s]  stream. And then we had three dollars from al store H2O. Thank you for the three bucks.
[4062.86s -> 4065.48s]  Hey German, for the first time since the start of making videos for fun,
[4065.48s -> 4069.48s]  I'm trying to record an audio track for a video. The thing is I don't think my voice
[4069.48s -> 4073.80s]  is pleasant enough and I don't think I can physically convey the emotion needed for the
[4073.80s -> 4078.42s]  video. What do you do to get the right voice and emotion for your jokes and videos?
[4078.42s -> 4082.42s]  And is it okay to just give up and try to work without one if I can't make it work?
[4083.38s -> 4090.68s]  Thanks and I hope you have a great night. Well, there's three or four kind of just probably
[4090.68s -> 4096.92s]  two or three actual questions in here. And the first one I would tell you is,
[4099.91s -> 4108.23s]  if you're talking about recording voice lines, in almost every single thing you've ever heard
[4108.23s -> 4115.43s]  me say, all the voices you've ever heard were based on somebody in real life or somebody that
[4115.43s -> 4122.31s]  I've heard before. Grandpa is actually based on the grandpa voice, this one here. Grandpa,
[4122.31s -> 4129.62s]  this one, is based on my actual fucking grandmother. That's how my grandmother talked.
[4129.62s -> 4141.80s]  And I would just imitate all her friends. That is my grandmother's voice. And I think
[4141.80s -> 4150.39s]  a lot of it comes from observing and imitating, whether it's somebody that's a celebrity or a
[4150.39s -> 4155.83s]  friend of yours that talks in a certain way, has certain cadences. Picking up on mannerisms
[4155.83s -> 4160.47s]  and cadences is actually potentially more important than having a voice sound different,
[4165.98s -> 4176.98s]  especially if you're trying to do voices. But for the second part of that,
[4178.63s -> 4182.95s]  it just comes to practice. And look, I'll be real. I'll be completely real.
[4183.59s -> 4187.99s]  You see, you mentioned, is it okay to try to work without one or to just give up if I can't
[4187.99s -> 4197.69s]  make it work? If everybody has something they can do, right? And even if, let's just say,
[4197.69s -> 4201.05s]  for instance, if you're really into voice work, you really love voice acting,
[4201.05s -> 4206.73s]  you love cartoons, you love voice over artists, you live and breathe in something
[4206.73s -> 4211.88s]  you fucking love so much. There are other jobs in that industry that aren't necessarily
[4211.88s -> 4219.18s]  recording the voice work. You don't have to be the one that's producing the sound out of your
[4219.18s -> 4223.82s]  mouth. You can be an engineer, you can be a writer, you can be an audio technician,
[4223.82s -> 4230.04s]  you can even work in the field. And I think a lot of people maybe get a little caught up in
[4233.27s -> 4240.14s]  needing to do that one specific thing, right? When that one specific thing has a lot of
[4240.14s -> 4245.90s]  branches with a ton of leaves on them that are different things to do in that field that
[4245.90s -> 4252.01s]  will scratch the same itch from doing the thing that you really wanted to do in the first place.
[4252.01s -> 4267.61s]  But that's not to say to, oh, just give up. Give up on your dreams. No. Give them a try.
[4268.55s -> 4285.91s]  Go for it. But there's more than just that one thing. There's a lot more. I hope that
[4285.91s -> 4295.96s]  answers your question. Look, if people gave up on their dreams, we wouldn't have
[4296.84s -> 4302.90s]  half of the shit that we have in society today. Half of the stuff that we like,
[4302.90s -> 4307.14s]  that we all know, that we care about, probably wouldn't even exist at all.
[4307.14s -> 4321.67s]  If everybody was like, nah, you know what, forget it. But thank you so much. I wish you
[4321.67s -> 4330.62s]  the best of luck. That was Al Storr. Thank you, Al Storr. I also have to remember that
[4330.62s -> 4336.92s]  half of following your dreams is luck. Yeah, it's a lot of factors. It's a complex,
[4336.92s -> 4344.89s]  complicated thing. And that is trying to live up to your dream. Because there are so many
[4344.89s -> 4352.09s]  outside factors that are in play that you might not even be aware of. That luck plays a very,
[4352.09s -> 4357.99s]  very large role. Being at the right place, in the right moment, talking to the right person,
[4358.79s -> 4362.23s]  somehow being in the right place at the right time. It means a lot.
[4362.95s -> 4379.08s]  Yeah, you got it right there. Luck, hard work, talent, more. It's a complex mixture of a
[4379.08s -> 4392.55s]  bunch of different things. But not necessarily when you're following a dream. You're usually
[4392.55s -> 4396.79s]  following it because you have a plan in mind. You have factors that can influence your path
[4396.79s -> 4407.19s]  towards that dream. Yeah, but I can tell you right now as a 33 going on 34 year old, plans
[4407.83s -> 4416.81s]  always change. They just do. You might have the end goal in your eyes at what you want to
[4416.81s -> 4424.36s]  do, but the plans are always changing. Stuff is always changing in a plan, especially in a life
[4424.36s -> 4430.82s]  goal. Because the way that I had my plan set out and the thing that I really cared about
[4430.82s -> 4436.50s]  has warped and changed directions and moved around. It's the goal is still there. It's
[4436.50s -> 4442.49s]  still there, but that path changes. And you might not even know you're on a different one.
[4442.49s -> 4447.83s]  You might be doing something that you don't even understand until years later is a branch
[4447.83s -> 4457.96s]  of a path that you were on in the beginning. Be flexible. Yeah, that's a really good point.
[4471.96s -> 4486.36s]  Will I play Monster Rancher VR when it comes out? Yeah, whenever that is. You could use that
[4486.36s -> 4492.57s]  anywhere. Whatever your dream is. Whatever you want to do. Whatever the message here was about
[4492.57s -> 4496.97s]  voice work. But apply that to anything. Apply that to anything that you want to do in your
[4496.97s -> 4514.41s]  life. But thank you Al Store. Good luck. And get dunked on again. We just touched upon the
[4514.41s -> 4520.71s]  video that we just watched. You gave another five, six, seven almost dollars here. Thank you
[4520.71s -> 4530.92s]  for that awesome video. Hey, Freudian Weapon, thanks for the 250. I say to Jerma Hart. Thank
[4530.92s -> 4538.94s]  you. SereneFP, thanks for the 250. You know, Jerma started regularly watching your streams
[4538.94s -> 4543.50s]  exactly a year ago during your speed run of Monster Rancher 2. Wanted to thank you for
[4543.50s -> 4554.87s]  being one of the few streamers who can genuinely make me laugh. Yeah, I'm fucking grateful
[4554.87s -> 4561.82s]  and thankful that you came. I'm glad you think the things I say are worth watching.
[4564.33s -> 4568.01s]  Really appreciate that. And you bring up Monster Rancher. I actually think I'm going
[4568.01s -> 4573.67s]  to go back to Monster Rancher 2. I have this weird itch to play it. I don't know why.
[4577.58s -> 4584.79s]  For some reason. It's just I feel like I want to do it again. Hey, Magellan, thanks
[4584.79s -> 4588.15s]  for the five dollars. Had a great time tonight, Jerma. Glad you decided to stick out Minecraft
[4588.87s -> 4593.43s]  VR for a bit longer and make a session out of it. Definitely seems like you enjoyed it.
[4593.43s -> 4596.23s]  Thank you for all the laughs and wonderful times you bring the community and I. Have
[4596.23s -> 4602.60s]  fun with your friends in the next few days and rest up from all the VR. Thank you.
[4604.84s -> 4615.00s]  I will have a few days here where I'm going to take the days, you know. It's been a
[4615.00s -> 4621.16s]  little nicer. It was really beautiful out today. Get some sun. Hang out with some friends.
[4623.51s -> 4631.70s]  And I got a little bit of work I can get done as well in a couple of days. A little
[4631.70s -> 4638.10s]  bit of not stream or video related type stuff. There's things that I've kind of
[4638.10s -> 4651.42s]  been on the back burner that I have to get done. But thank you. Let me add a Dorkcube.
[4651.42s -> 4656.94s]  Thanks to the 250 Dorkcube. You're getting a rare spawn in Minecraft despite your love
[4656.94s -> 4661.26s]  hate relationship with the game reminds me of that Futurama episode where the professor
[4661.26s -> 4678.63s]  accidentally disproos evolution. Yeah. That was a great show. This was such a perfect moment.
[4678.63s -> 4709.22s]  You called exactly what was going to happen. What do you mean? What did I do? Oh no.
[4712.47s -> 4715.67s]  Where's my house? Like that was going to do anything. What's one of the four horsemen
[4715.67s -> 4732.66s]  doing here? What? It really did look like the four horsemen. That wave though. That's like
[4733.30s -> 4748.57s]  that had a giant lollipop. Get away from me. Get away. He summoned it. I have expected
[4748.57s -> 4761.48s]  Metallica to start playing. That's so funny. But thank you. Thank you. That was Demonic
[4761.48s -> 4768.66s]  Cucumber. Thank you. Anything else show official for the five bucks. You're the man.
[4768.66s -> 4772.66s]  I've been working on a new Vegas mod for you and wanted to say thank you for the inspiration.
[4772.66s -> 4776.58s]  All the models and stuff I've been working on are in the creative channel on Discord.
[4776.58s -> 4779.94s]  I'm not finished with the mod but I wanted to tell you that. My life has been busy
[4779.94s -> 4783.46s]  and stressful in the mod and streams is the one thing I've been excited about.
[4785.32s -> 4801.14s]  I can't wait to see what you come up with. That's somebody making a mod. That's awesome.
[4802.09s -> 4810.62s]  I sincerely fucking look forward to what it comes up. Thank you. Anything show. Anything
[4810.62s -> 4815.82s]  else show official for the five bucks. Keep us updated. Keep us posted on it.
[4815.82s -> 4822.52s]  The Jack. Thanks for five dollars, Jack. Do you actually yourself like the silly memes
[4822.52s -> 4826.68s]  from years past that we still use or are so detached to how you are now?
[4827.64s -> 4840.94s]  No, I mean, all jokes aside, they're locked away inside my heart there in the chest
[4841.82s -> 4844.94s]  pump thing that puts blood through into your brain and into your body.
[4845.90s -> 4857.19s]  So no, I don't hate old references and memes because at some point that means that this
[4857.27s -> 4864.63s]  is like a living breathing community, right? That makes me happy to know that. That people
[4864.63s -> 4870.79s]  are using references that from years ago or things that they're coming up with. That means
[4870.79s -> 4875.59s]  that we have a great community. That means we have a very active, lively community.
[4875.59s -> 4901.21s]  But thank you, the Jack. I do not hate the memes. No. And thank you to Al Store again.
[4901.21s -> 4906.34s]  Four dollars and 50 cents for Al Store. This is compensation for accidentally putting
[4906.34s -> 4914.28s]  in so much in one message. I already spent like 25 to 30 hours on a video so the voice work
[4914.28s -> 4919.00s]  might be supplementary and I think I'll be proud of it regardless. But I still needed to hear
[4919.00s -> 4923.64s]  what you said and I can't thank you enough. You're always so comforting and practical with
[4923.64s -> 4933.11s]  life advice. I really wish that whatever you do, it's something that you like doing.
[4934.70s -> 4939.08s]  Something that you can enjoy. Something that you can work on
[4939.88s -> 4955.53s]  and be like, that was good. I liked that. I enjoyed that. Thank you so much Al Store.
[4959.22s -> 4964.10s]  And with that, we are going to run the credits. All the new subs and all the old subs
[4964.74s -> 4977.26s]  coming on the screen right now. I will see you all on Wednesday. So three, so four days from
[4977.26s -> 4997.22s]  now. Yeah, one, two, three. I'll see you on the 20th. I'm going to go take a bath and get
[4997.22s -> 5006.78s]  some food. Have a great rest of your beginning of your weekend, right, Saturday. Still fairly
[5006.78s -> 5012.22s]  early on Saturday Pacific. Hopefully you guys are going to enjoy your St. Patrick's Day,
[5012.22s -> 5022.07s]  right? That's today, right? St. Patrick's Day is today, right? No, it's tomorrow.
[5022.07s -> 5032.34s]  So happy St. Patrick's Day for all of you. Let's celebrate tomorrow. It's Sunday afternoon
[5032.34s -> 5050.41s]  here. Well, there you go. Happy St. Patrick's Day. Highly recommend looking to the Deluxe
[5050.41s -> 5054.89s]  Audio Strap for the Vive. Makes tightening it up a lot easier and the headphones are on
[5054.89s -> 5060.01s]  ears so no worrying about them slipping out. Yeah, but it's also my problem too. I do one
[5060.01s -> 5074.23s]  earphone because I lost my mind and I can't find it. No, I, for some reason, 10-15 years
[5074.23s -> 5080.31s]  ago, I came to this assumption that I cannot do two headphones in. And even with in-ear
[5080.95s -> 5085.99s]  back, you know, the open back ones, it still just makes me feel claustrophobic. I don't
[5085.99s -> 5105.26s]  know why. I'm just a weirdo. And then finally we had a Leos BM came in right now with
[5105.26s -> 5112.90s]  three bucks, three dollars. I just resubbed. Can't donate on mobile, but I thought I'd
[5112.90s -> 5117.30s]  ask, I'd like to ask this here. I've always liked to do impressions of people, like
[5117.30s -> 5121.78s]  you said, and seeing you as an inspiration. I know I want to do something with that
[5121.78s -> 5125.62s]  talent and streaming seems great, but I feel like it's too late to get into it at this
[5125.62s -> 5129.30s]  point. Do you think that being a comedy streamer is something that I could viably
[5129.30s -> 5141.02s]  pursue? Thanks. It's hard to answer that question because content and what people
[5141.02s -> 5146.26s]  want to see and what people watch, it's hard to say, hey, that material is going
[5146.26s -> 5156.66s]  to work. That material won't work. You need to do this for material. It's a hard
[5156.66s -> 5163.86s]  question to answer because on one hand you have the true just reality of Twitch,
[5163.86s -> 5168.98s]  right? And that's thousands and thousands and thousands of broadcasters all at the
[5168.98s -> 5173.56s]  same time, all going, all trying to get people on their streams and hey, come on
[5173.56s -> 5176.84s]  to come to my stream. Hang on to my stream. Look what I'm doing. I'm doing
[5176.84s -> 5179.64s]  something here. I'm playing this game. You like that game, right? It's a lot.
[5180.44s -> 5186.12s]  So trying to differentiate yourself and put yourself out there as it's very
[5186.12s -> 5192.98s]  difficult to do, but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't try to do it. Just
[5192.98s -> 5198.52s]  make sure you be realistic. Make sure that you are doing it because you want to
[5199.16s -> 5202.04s]  and it's something that you want to do. It's something that you care about,
[5202.68s -> 5212.42s]  not something that you're doing because you think you have to. And you can take
[5212.42s -> 5227.06s]  that last conversation we had about it and apply it to this too. You need to
[5227.06s -> 5229.62s]  enjoy it regardless of how many people watch. Yeah, you have to just...
[5232.15s -> 5236.63s]  When I made my first five YouTube videos, I just was doing them because I
[5236.63s -> 5243.27s]  wanted to do them. That seems like fun. That seems interesting. That seems like
[5243.27s -> 5245.91s]  something I think is really cool. That's something I want to try to do.
[5250.58s -> 5254.42s]  The only rule is you can't stream when Jerma is streaming. You dig?
[5257.24s -> 5265.40s]  Now it's all about the money. Now the thing is though, you'll never know unless you try.
[5268.23s -> 5275.05s]  You can't fail unless you try. I was thinking about that, but I didn't. I think
[5275.05s -> 5281.16s]  I just would fail at it. Just do it. There's no reason not to try it.
[5288.25s -> 5295.69s]  And networking goes a long way. Hanging out, trying to help out in other people's streams,
[5295.69s -> 5301.45s]  finding similar interests and collaborating. Only if people want to collaborate. You never want
[5301.45s -> 5306.17s]  to throw yourself into a situation where you're like, hey, what's going on? How are you? I see
[5306.17s -> 5319.21s]  that you do this too. Let's do a video tomorrow. Which is natural. The only way to get
[5319.21s -> 5328.01s]  up is to fall down sometimes. Go watch my first 50 YouTube videos.
[5329.29s -> 5335.05s]  And tell me that I didn't figure out more things to try and did some things wrong.
[5337.14s -> 5341.70s]  Maybe I shouldn't have uploaded that video because was that video good?
[5342.66s -> 5350.39s]  My latest videos from the last two years ago, you learn. You grow. And you keep trying.
[5357.70s -> 5368.46s]  Go watch my latest videos from two and a half years ago. But I wish you the best of luck.
[5370.04s -> 5376.44s]  Is it Leos or Leo? It's probably Leo SSBM. I think I called you Leos.
[5382.66s -> 5386.82s]  Yeah, but you can't figure out what you want to do until you try to start doing it in the first
[5386.82s -> 5395.38s]  place. Everybody has this big painting that they have. And there's a giant canvas on the wall.
[5395.38s -> 5400.34s]  It's an empty canvas. And it's just sitting up there. And it's, I can't wait for this
[5400.34s -> 5404.50s]  painting. It's going to be, look at this fucking huge painting. Oh, there's the Mona Lisa
[5404.50s -> 5409.62s]  is going to be there flying. And over there, there's a cheetah that's going to be over there.
[5409.62s -> 5414.65s]  There's a jungle. But it's like, you got to start painting. Yeah, yeah, I know. But look
[5414.65s -> 5421.27s]  at the cheetah. The cheetah is coming out there from the jungle. And then you go and you start
[5421.27s -> 5424.55s]  on the cheetah. And everyone's like, all right, man, I can't wait to see the huge
[5425.35s -> 5431.26s]  15 by 15 foot mural on the wall. And then you start painting the fucking cheetah portion.
[5431.26s -> 5436.47s]  Maybe you start painting the tree. And it's a little bit of brown paint. And it looks like
[5436.47s -> 5445.32s]  a little smudge. Eventually that little smudge turns into the bark. And that bark turns into
[5445.32s -> 5450.12s]  the branches. That branches turns into the tree. And then that tree turns into the cheetah.
[5451.54s -> 5463.66s]  And then the cheetah turns into the Mona Lisa. You have to start painting. Somebody said,
[5463.66s -> 5470.31s]  you lost me. Point is, everybody has a big picture that they want to paint. Well,
[5470.31s -> 5475.16s]  maybe not everybody. But a lot of people have this big painting. And you have to close
[5475.16s -> 5479.32s]  down a little. And remember, you have to start, you have to start painting that painting.
[5480.06s -> 5483.66s]  And it's not going to look like the painting that you think it is until it's done,
[5484.22s -> 5493.19s]  potentially months or years later. Start small and put realistic goals in front of yourself.
[5496.31s -> 5511.85s]  Just use a spray can. But that's my time. I will see you guys on Wednesday. Have a great
[5511.85s -> 5540.34s]  rest of your weekend. Take care, all of you. See you on Wednesday. Ta ta. Goodbye.
[5540.42s -> 5543.85s]  Oh, and uh, what's the way he'll somebody's birthday?
[5544.73s -> 5551.78s]  Happy birthday. Happy birthday. Was it bath? Happy birthday tomorrow on St. Patrick's Day.
[5554.76s -> 5557.72s]  Have a good one. See you Wednesday.
