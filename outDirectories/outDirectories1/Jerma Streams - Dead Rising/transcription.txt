[1.53s -> 6.50s]  I was thinking about waiting. That was a bad thing to start with. I should have done that
[6.50s -> 11.10s]  before. That's why I'm muted. I had an opportunity to do that before the stream turned on. I don't
[11.10s -> 18.97s]  know what... I shouldn't be in control of this button. I was gonna wait till 1 pm, but I'm here.
[18.97s -> 22.81s]  I'm ready. I'm just ready to go. I don't need to wait till... I've been sitting here for like
[22.81s -> 30.62s]  five minutes just going like, you know, okay, I'm here. Let's just go early. Not even that early.
[31.34s -> 36.82s]  But still, we're here. Good afternoon. If you joined us last night,
[37.78s -> 41.30s]  today, I talked about how Dead Rising 1 was gonna be the stream today.
[42.18s -> 49.30s]  And I also made a mistake talking about how... what was gonna happen over the next couple days.
[49.30s -> 53.86s]  I told you I had a doctor's appointment tomorrow. That's not true. It actually is the next day.
[53.94s -> 63.16s]  So, uh, I believe this game takes somewhere between 10 to 12 hours to do it. 13 hours.
[64.58s -> 70.06s]  So we're gonna do this today, and we're gonna do this tomorrow. I will then go to my doctor's
[70.06s -> 78.76s]  appointment. So we're gonna bang out Dead Rising the next two days in a row. This is a two-hour
[78.76s -> 90.70s]  game. No, it is not. This is not a two-hour game. Yeah, what I know about Dead Rising, at least the
[90.70s -> 95.88s]  original. In fact, all the Dead Rising, it doesn't matter which one it is. I've collectively played
[96.76s -> 106.38s]  maybe six and a half hours of all of them combined. Dead Rising 1, Dead Rising 2, Dead Rising 3.
[107.18s -> 114.33s]  So, I mean, I know how the game kind of works. I've played it off and on a couple of times,
[114.33s -> 118.89s]  randomly, 60% of the way through somebody else's playthrough on a couch.
[119.61s -> 123.11s]  Dude, take this! You guys, try Dead Rising. You can throw CDs at people, and it's like,
[123.11s -> 126.71s]  CDs? What are you talking about? I remember grabbing the CDs,
[127.27s -> 132.47s]  and the phrase being CDs at zombies. And I also remember having like, there's like a Lego set.
[132.47s -> 138.68s]  That's the only thing I know. And you have a camera. So we're gonna just, I'm gonna play the whole
[138.68s -> 146.70s]  thing. Seems like one of those games that I should have done a long time ago. Um, no, but I had this
[146.70s -> 155.35s]  two videos of Dead Rising 2 and Dead Rising 3. Maybe I'll just do them all. Not back to back,
[155.35s -> 160.12s]  but should I just play Dead Rising 2 and Dead Rising 3 eventually? Just play them
[161.00s -> 170.20s]  all the way through? Don't do Dead, there's a, wait, there's Dead Rising 4. Did I play Dead
[170.20s -> 179.22s]  Rising 4? I didn't remember. Did I? What's the one where you had to get the phone app from Microsoft
[179.22s -> 191.77s]  to like, call in an airstrike? Which one was that? Was that three or four? Three. Yeah, there was a
[191.77s -> 196.09s]  phone companion app that you could get for Dead Rising 3 to call in an airstrike from your phone.
[196.97s -> 206.46s]  Well, we'll see. But that's what we're gonna do today into tomorrow. That's the plan. And I'm
[206.46s -> 228.06s]  almost ready to go here. Just give me one more second and we'll get started. I don't know where
[228.06s -> 237.48s]  my lip balm is. This is bad. I mean, this, this is a, this is a total diva moment. I know, but like,
[237.48s -> 246.62s]  I can't, I cannot stream without my lip balm. It's not gonna, it's not possible. It's not possible.
[246.62s -> 255.46s]  I can't do it. It's the only way I can live stream. Where is it? I always have two balms right next
[255.46s -> 265.53s]  to me at all times. Whatever. Stream is canceled. Now, fuck it. Whatever. Let's go. I'll be all
[265.53s -> 268.89s]  right. Okay. So the stream sucks today. It's cause I didn't have lip balm on at the very beginning.
[269.69s -> 275.66s]  Don't forget that. All right. So I got everything ready to go. Start game. This is just going to be
[275.66s -> 283.72s]  Dead Rising 1. Let's see how fun it is. I heard it's fun. 72 hour mode. New game, right? That's
[283.72s -> 289.08s]  what I want to do, right? That means I have 72. That's three streams, three full days.
[289.88s -> 293.32s]  That's the one, right? Is this the PC? This is the PC version. Is that a bad thing?
[300.62s -> 309.42s]  No, no. Okay. So I'm just 72 hour mode. That's the one, right? September 19th, 11 at 27.
[310.30s -> 321.46s]  It was PM AM. Haven't you played this game? It's like randomly, like on a friend's couch.
[322.66s -> 337.93s]  I've never played through the whole game. Have I played through this game on camera? No, I don't
[337.93s -> 343.29s]  even guys. I've played like 12,000 games on stream and on video. I don't know. I have no idea.
[343.29s -> 349.61s]  Say buddy. No, I didn't. You mentioned something about research for a story. That's right. Got a
[349.61s -> 355.21s]  tip that something big's happening in a nowhere little town like that. They sure didn't mention
[355.21s -> 361.91s]  anything about it on TV. Yeah. Well, I'm freelance pal. I don't make my living waiting for the TV
[361.99s -> 364.55s]  to play for on the street. Yeah, I kind of remember that.
[367.08s -> 387.43s]  Not this one. Population 53500 characteristics. Jack shit.
[391.37s -> 394.73s]  The only thing to do in this town is kill time at the shopping mall.
[395.69s -> 399.94s]  All right, every quiet. Everybody said anything. I'm talking to myself.
[400.58s -> 412.02s]  Was that the army? Yeah, I took a sip out of my water over here. That's been here since last
[412.02s -> 417.46s]  night and it tastes like hamburger meat. I don't know why that's fucked up. I had to share that
[417.46s -> 421.38s]  because that's strange. I want to get shots of the whole town before the national guard finishes
[421.38s -> 432.60s]  roping it off. Take me over the main street. Cooked hamburger meat. All right, here we go.
[433.16s -> 441.19s]  Oh, I can take pictures. How do I take a picture? Zoom in. Should I take a photo? Oh,
[441.19s -> 448.90s]  okay. That's zoom in. X is shutter. Got it. Oh, you got you get points. You did points for things.
[448.90s -> 454.98s]  Okay, move camera. Zoom in. I didn't there's enough picture of nothing. How do we zoom out?
[455.62s -> 466.92s]  There we go. Okay, so zoom in and zoom out. This is Pokemon snap. I need more stuff going on. Here
[466.92s -> 486.58s]  we go. Zoom in. Nice brutality. Oh, wait. Action shot. Got it right when it was about to happen.
[487.22s -> 494.92s]  Damn it. I almost had it. Save this guy? Like, how am I supposed to save this guy?
[497.72s -> 507.16s]  Are they on the playground? No, zoom in. I would laugh so hard if one went down the slide. Wait,
[507.16s -> 515.83s]  here we go. He's gonna do it. Come on. Damn it. He didn't let go under the tire.
[520.95s -> 528.33s]  Oh, they're killing this guy. If I was just stayed on this,
[528.97s -> 540.92s]  I could have reduced the sensitivity on this camera too. Wait, no genre. This is genre for
[540.92s -> 551.03s]  the photos and everything. Should I get a picture of the skyline? That's not bad. Right here. Right
[551.03s -> 567.61s]  down like Main Street. Are they saving these photos by the way? Oh, I have 17 photos remaining. Is
[567.61s -> 576.74s]  that what that is? Should I wait? That's kind of interesting. I mean, that's not interesting.
[577.30s -> 588.23s]  This is just a guy standing on a roof. That's not that interesting. No, I gotta get better
[588.23s -> 603.19s]  on that. Perfect. I gotta make sure I get a good angle. Whoa, no, I got it.
[607.64s -> 630.98s]  I just barely got it too. What else we got? We're going up. Okay. Take a picture of your face.
[635.69s -> 650.22s]  I can't. Here we go. Wait, wait, wait. Somebody fighting. Nice. She's gonna fall off. She's gonna
[650.22s -> 659.42s]  fall off. She's gonna fall off. She's gonna fall off. I'm ready. I'm ready for the photo. Come on.
[660.06s -> 685.05s]  I'm gonna get it right here. Come on. And come on. Got it. Wait, that wasn't her.
[695.50s -> 711.46s]  I got it too nice. Off the titan trunk. Why is everybody calling me fucked up? What? This is
[711.46s -> 724.98s]  part of the game. I need to take photos and stuff. I'm a psycho. I can't save them.
[729.10s -> 738.66s]  Can you get me on? You gotta be kidding me. Man, you are nuts. Not with that attitude.
[740.98s -> 746.18s]  No, not with any. I got a camera in my hand. Don't forget to come back. We don't have like
[746.18s -> 754.02s]  grenade launchers in here. It's Frank. Frank West. Remember that name because the whole world's
[754.02s -> 761.83s]  gonna know it in three days. When I get confirmed for Smash Brothers on the next Nintendo Direct.
[762.63s -> 773.19s]  Now there it goes. A lot of helicopters flying really close.
[783.86s -> 801.10s]  Am I gonna make it jump for it? Get a photo of that one. Can I take a picture of this?
[806.36s -> 808.92s]  Big Bits came in. After the cutscene.
[818.92s -> 819.56s]  Gonna turn this up.
[827.90s -> 839.72s]  Didn't you? What did you see from the sky? Well, if it were just a riot,
[840.36s -> 846.14s]  I doubt the military would quarantine the entire area. The moratorium on information getting out
[846.14s -> 851.91s]  is a little extreme in my opinion. Frank is so ugly. What are you talking about?
[851.91s -> 857.45s]  Something else I can't put my finger on. What are you talking about? Doesn't sound like civil
[857.45s -> 866.70s]  disobedience. It's too quiet. Almost as if everyone's already dead.
[869.93s -> 874.09s]  Yeah, he looks like he's squished. So why don't you just tell me already?
[874.09s -> 879.32s]  What? Nope. All right, just listen to the cutscene. I think you'd better see for yourself.
[882.39s -> 893.19s]  This, my friend, is hell. Let's bring the camera up and just take a picture right in his face
[893.91s -> 901.43s]  so I can remember who this person is. I'd be taking pictures of everybody I came across.
[901.99s -> 910.74s]  Can you stand right here for a second? Let me take a photo. Frank must be on the heliport
[910.74s -> 914.66s]  at 12 p.m. on the 22nd or he will be left behind in the mall.
[915.70s -> 923.50s]  Okay. Pay careful attention to the time as you play. So the check... No, it's not tab. There it is.
[924.22s -> 934.55s]  All right, so check watch is left on the d-pad. So it is 12 o'clock on the 19th. Oh, that's fast.
[936.60s -> 953.61s]  Check watch. Why do I have like a world news ticker down here? Okay. Check watch. What about it?
[959.75s -> 964.28s]  I don't need to... Why do I... I checked the watch already. Looks like you're the only journalist
[964.28s -> 970.66s]  that made it out of here. Okay. I'm looking forward to some nice pictures. Oh, wait. Hold on. How do
[970.66s -> 990.95s]  I take a photo? Good. Okay. Security room. Why did it just want to tell me to check my watch five
[990.95s -> 996.30s]  times? You can save your progress at locations marked with S such as the sofa in the security
[996.30s -> 1001.50s]  room or the mall's public restroom. Okay. I can save in the bathroom or in the security room.
[1003.03s -> 1009.72s]  So you can save your progress at locations marked with S. So just the sofa in the security room.
[1009.72s -> 1019.38s]  What's in here? Change clothes. All right. I guess I'm a golfer now. All right. What do I want to be
[1019.38s -> 1033.24s]  dressed as? All right. I don't know. I want the golf. All right. All right. Okay. So that's cool.
[1033.96s -> 1041.40s]  Am I sprinting or is there a sprint button? Is there crafting in this one? I remember playing
[1041.48s -> 1047.35s]  like the third and fourth one. You had to make stuff. All right. Um, hold on. What's over here?
[1053.05s -> 1057.93s]  All right. I don't want to like waste time because I don't really have any time. How much time? I've
[1057.93s -> 1061.29s]  been walking around for 20 minutes. All right. I bet. Just save the game. Where's the security
[1061.29s -> 1068.92s]  room? Which one of these is the security room? Straight ahead. This is the janitor's room.
[1069.56s -> 1105.29s]  What is this? I'm just wasting more time. What? Okay. All right. So that zero killed. Well,
[1105.29s -> 1114.55s]  actually one is killed. Uh, staff. I know. Where's the where's the actual security room?
[1114.55s -> 1124.74s]  Is it back here? Is it up the stairs? Where's the where's the security room?
[1125.38s -> 1134.41s]  The one with the green sofa. Which one of these had a green sofa? It's it's right here. There's
[1134.41s -> 1141.64s]  no security. It's not security room. This is the security room. I thought I had to go in one of the
[1141.64s -> 1158.36s]  one of the rooms was a security room. No, it's the security sofa. Okay. All right. Is there a
[1158.36s -> 1171.99s]  ladder? No. So what the fuck am I supposed to do? Just leave? Uh, I guess I'm going this way.
[1187.50s -> 1207.72s]  Entrance. I've never played Dead Rising 1. I told you. I had somebody handing me the controller
[1207.72s -> 1222.33s]  like 17 hours into the game to throw CDs. Who the fuck is this guy? Who are these people?
[1223.43s -> 1225.27s]  She's like, she just tackled me twice.
[1225.27s -> 1231.98s]  Without my precious little sweetie doggie. Oh, where is my my doggy shield? All right. Mission
[1231.98s -> 1251.64s]  one. Save dog. Hey, this is no time to ogle pretty girls, son. You're looking to get yourself
[1251.64s -> 1258.20s]  beaten alive by zombies. Holy shit. This guy's eyes. Did you just say zombies? Take a look out
[1258.20s -> 1270.02s]  there. If those ain't zombies, what would you call them? They're gonna get in. Why is everybody
[1270.02s -> 1274.66s]  getting so close to your face? Yeah. One is just jumping right into your face. Since last night.
[1275.70s -> 1285.70s]  Now, they're all that's out there. Hey, look on the bright side. Zombies are stupid and slow.
[1287.14s -> 1294.73s]  We should be safe in here. All right, then feel like making yourself standing in my shot. Take
[1294.73s -> 1301.10s]  a look around the mall. Bring anything we can use for the barricade back here. This barricade sucks.
[1301.10s -> 1305.74s]  You just threw a bunch of benches in the way. Where's the car that's parked in every mall?
[1306.54s -> 1311.40s]  Back the car up here. There's got to be at least two of them, right? All right. Find something.
[1312.89s -> 1319.74s]  Find something to block. All right. I don't have time for this. I'm on the clock right now. It's
[1319.74s -> 1329.34s]  been an hour. All right. Find something to barricade. Okay. It's drama. That guy's a gun. All
[1329.34s -> 1342.57s]  right. Whatever. Let's go. But I have to take photos of people. Hold on. Nice. More drama.
[1343.13s -> 1346.09s]  How many photos do I have? I don't want to just take photos of random shit. What's this?
[1348.22s -> 1362.97s]  Over the shoulder. Nice drama. Okay. I think I found something. I'm running around like a shit
[1362.97s -> 1373.91s]  myself. I'm fine. You right there. Do you have any idea what you've done? Why did you summon me to
[1373.91s -> 1378.55s]  this place? What are you planning? Would you calm down? I don't even know what you're talking about.
[1378.55s -> 1406.34s]  Can you open the door? I think they got in. No. So, it's the lady saving her dog is what starts
[1406.34s -> 1434.94s]  the whole outbreak here. I think the dog's a zombie. Okay. Well, there's so many character
[1434.94s -> 1448.65s]  introductions. What do I do? To the stairs. All right. I'm going. But what about everybody else
[1448.65s -> 1456.76s]  down here? HDTV. All right. Different items perform different actions. Some weapons are capable of
[1456.76s -> 1461.40s]  special attacks performed by holding X for a moment. You can attack or you can hold right
[1461.40s -> 1467.38s]  trigger and X's throw. Multiple items can be held in stock simultaneously. The maximum stock number
[1467.38s -> 1473.86s]  can be raised by leveling up. You can change the bumpers. Throw an item down. Down. Unequipped is
[1473.86s -> 1477.06s]  up. Okay. Sounds pretty simple enough.
[1488.65s -> 1496.01s]  Oh, no. It's dead. Kathy. Kathy, hold on a second. I'm coming. I'm coming. Kathy.
[1496.81s -> 1509.98s]  Stand behind me. Kathy. Yep. These things are scripted. They're supposed to die. It's scripted.
[1509.98s -> 1520.46s]  It's scripted. It's okay. You can't save them. This is scripted. You can't. Barley, come here.
[1521.10s -> 1524.39s]  What are you doing? Smoking a cigarette? What are you doing? Come here.
[1526.63s -> 1541.78s]  No, no. Get. What the hell? All right. You know what? It's scripted. It's scripted, right?
[1546.92s -> 1552.63s]  Whoa. When grabbed by multiple zombies, an escape command will appear on the screen.
[1552.63s -> 1556.39s]  None of the commands is directed before the time runs out and you can escape the dangerous situation.
[1557.27s -> 1573.43s]  Okay. Well, I'm sorry. I tried. Barley and Willis is dead. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out.
[1573.83s -> 1594.09s]  Watch out. I made it. All this because grandma wanted the dog. Yeah. Oh, I made it out. No, I
[1594.09s -> 1604.70s]  didn't. Where are the others? Imagine like a zombie apocalypse happens and the first thing that you
[1604.70s -> 1609.58s]  do is you grab a bench and just throw it. They got away. Just into everybody. Why would you do
[1609.58s -> 1620.76s]  something like that? Like come up with a plan. A quick one. Not grab heavy object and throw into
[1620.76s -> 1634.68s]  friends because those things are in the mall. We better not use this door. Well, what are you
[1634.68s -> 1643.43s]  doing? The air ducks. They'll get us back into the mall and apparently those things aren't
[1643.43s -> 1650.87s]  smart enough to use the ducks so they won't be a factor. Wait a minute. You want to get back in
[1650.87s -> 1670.36s]  there? What for? He's gonna get grabbed. Hey. Nice camera. Are you a photographer?
[1672.26s -> 1675.86s]  No, no, no. Never ask anybody if they have a camera. They're a photographer. They're gonna
[1675.86s -> 1692.55s]  talk your ear off for like two hours. Show me some pictures, Frank. You really seem to know what
[1692.55s -> 1697.70s]  you're doing. Wow. This is terrible. Who are you guys anyway? Why did you take pictures of people
[1697.70s -> 1726.31s]  falling off of the building? I don't know. I've never taken this costume off.
[1737.50s -> 1748.78s]  She wiped your SD card. Oh 70. What? It's already been two hours or an hour and like 10 minutes?
[1750.90s -> 1760.98s]  Okay, security room. Wait, is there like... I know you don't eat food. You do, right? How do you eat
[1760.98s -> 1769.58s]  it? Okay, so I'm gonna take coffee creamer. I'm gonna take two coffee creamers. I can't answer.
[1769.58s -> 1779.85s]  Okay, I gotta... Okay, what's up? You're planning on going back down into the mall, are you? I
[1779.85s -> 1784.65s]  wouldn't do that if I were you, but you young... Well, if you're gonna do it, at least take this.
[1784.65s -> 1788.65s]  Transceiver with you. And you better take this. You obtained the mall map. You obtained the
[1788.65s -> 1796.90s]  transceiver. All right. You obtained the mall map. Okay, so how do I use it? Well, how do I...
[1796.90s -> 1804.57s]  Should I just go in? I'm going... Go in? Any quests or anything? I'm just going in. I didn't save the
[1804.57s -> 1826.31s]  game. Fuck. Whatever. I'll be fine. This is a timed game. I can't just like dilly dally. Okay,
[1826.31s -> 1838.30s]  I'm on the roof. Jeff! Jeff! Come here. You! Have you seen my wife, Natalie? She should still be
[1838.30s -> 1845.96s]  around here. Hey, hey, hey! I'll lend a hand. That's a pretty good weapon. Fellow golfer, I see.
[1846.60s -> 1854.02s]  The name's Jeff Mayer, by the way. I'm Frank. I'm telling you, that back nine here is killer.
[1856.09s -> 1860.73s]  Escorting survivors. Survivors each behave differently depending on the circumstances
[1861.45s -> 1866.50s]  and their own varying personalities. It was a good idea to escort as many as possible to the
[1866.50s -> 1871.86s]  safety of the security room. Call survivor or set goal marker. Okay, so that's right triggered in
[1871.86s -> 1879.54s]  Y. So Y is to be like, come here. Okay. Okay, join. So... Follow me! All right, so follow me.
[1880.26s -> 1890.84s]  We're gonna find... gonna find your wife is around here somewhere. Follow me! Natalie,
[1890.84s -> 1901.22s]  found you. Come on, Jeff. I don't know how you guys even got separated. It's an open spot. It's an
[1901.22s -> 1915.08s]  open space. Wait, wait, hey, hey! Okay, let's go. I'll never let you go again. We have to go now.
[1915.80s -> 1922.09s]  It's not safe. I know a place. I'll take the security room. Once the number of photos taken
[1922.09s -> 1925.29s]  exceeds 30, they'll begin to be deleted in order automatically. You can save any photo from the
[1925.29s -> 1929.77s]  imminent deletion by switching to keep Y in the picture viewer. What? All right, let's go. Come
[1929.77s -> 1936.89s]  on. Come on. Let's go. PP prestige points are awarded for actions such as escorting survivors
[1936.89s -> 1942.65s]  to safety or defeating zombies, right? When the PP gauge becomes full, Frank levels up,
[1943.80s -> 1950.17s]  right? Attack power increases. Speed is running speed. Life is maximum. Health stock is item stock.
[1950.17s -> 1955.30s]  Throw is item throw distance. And new skill mastered is a new skill learner as it does it
[1955.30s -> 1963.96s]  automatically, I assume. All right, come on. Both of you, let's go. What are you doing? Come here.
[1963.96s -> 1983.05s]  Hurry up. I'm on the clock right now. Please, hurry up. What are they doing? What? Why won't
[1983.05s -> 1995.77s]  they follow me? What's going on? Talk to them? I can't. Oh, I just fucking backhanded. Why can't
[1995.77s -> 2005.61s]  I talk to them? Okay, we're good. Hurry up. No, I let's go. All right, we're good. We're good.
[2006.33s -> 2018.86s]  I didn't even hit the punch button. All right, to safety. It's up here. Follow me this way. Come
[2018.86s -> 2029.85s]  on up. Can she make it? Come on, Natalie. Hurry up. All right, go in there. No, no, no, no, no, go.
[2030.98s -> 2041.38s]  Just call me a bitch. No, get in here. Did they go in? Okay, good. I'm never going to the mall
[2041.38s -> 2048.57s]  again as long as I live. I've had about enough of this. Escort complete. Freddy Dread just gave
[2048.57s -> 2055.27s]  5,000 bits. All right, on time to go back out. Level up. No, no, no, no, no, no. Save the game.
[2056.07s -> 2061.94s]  Anything else in here? Through here? No message from Freddy Dread, just a shitload of money. Thank
[2061.94s -> 2081.70s]  you, Freddy Dread. Seriously. Okay, I'm good. Yes, overwrite. Mid to late game, hand to hand is nuts.
[2082.50s -> 2088.90s]  All right, hold on. Give me another apple. Okay, I have two coffee creamers, an apple, and a golf
[2088.90s -> 2100.81s]  club. All right, let's go. All right, I saved the first two people. Go down the elevator.
[2102.52s -> 2115.86s]  I guess I'm going to go down. I learned jump kick. Nice. Somebody calling me? Hey, it's Otis,
[2115.86s -> 2119.46s]  back in the security room. Can you hear me, Frank? Let me give you a rundown of the mall's layout
[2119.46s -> 2125.11s]  so you know what you're doing. Right, on the other side of the warehouse, you'll find Paradise Plaza.
[2125.11s -> 2128.39s]  There's lots of shops. There are restaurants, sporting goods, books. It's a pretty big mall,
[2128.39s -> 2134.87s]  so you probably need to use the can now and then. Just check the... What was it, left? What was it?
[2134.87s -> 2143.77s]  Which button was it? I don't know. People are talking too fast. Stop. Frank, are you there?
[2143.77s -> 2173.30s]  It's me, Otis the janitor. He just called me. Why did you have to hang up and call again? Hey.
[2181.77s -> 2188.15s]  It's probably just a sprain. Oh. You've got to help Brad, or he's done for. All right,
[2188.15s -> 2196.02s]  she's a zombie. Give me your gun. I'm the reason you just got hurt. Let me help. No, I can't let a
[2196.02s -> 2201.78s]  civilian do that. That's against regulations. Yeah, well, I don't think they had zombie-infested
[2201.78s -> 2208.90s]  malls in mind when they wrote those regulations, kid. You know how to use this? No idea. Absolutely
[2208.90s -> 2224.95s]  not a clue at all. I've covered wars, you know. See, at this point when I hold it backwards and
[2224.95s -> 2228.63s]  aim with the handle forward and go, just use this thing, I don't know, and then you like
[2228.63s -> 2240.47s]  wink at the camera, and then you go, you scoff and you walk away. All right, case one. September
[2240.47s -> 2248.60s]  19th from 12 p.m. Case one, two. Okay. The case panels form a guide to solving the mystery behind
[2248.60s -> 2254.20s]  the incident. When you encounter a key event, a new case panel opens, taking you one step closer
[2254.20s -> 2263.48s]  to the truth. New development. The case. You've been handed a gun. You can take a look at the
[2263.48s -> 2267.88s]  current status of the case panels via the case file option on the pause menu, okay?
[2269.02s -> 2272.70s]  When all the case panels have been filled in, the truth behind the incident will be revealed.
[2274.68s -> 2283.54s]  All right, so it's open right now. So this is like the story. Back up for Brad. Don't cut me off
[2283.54s -> 2287.54s]  like that. It's rude. Anyway, here's what I was going to say. There's some young guy wandering
[2287.54s -> 2293.19s]  around in Paradise Plaza. He's carrying a camera like you. I guess he must be a photographer too,
[2293.19s -> 2301.37s]  taking pictures at a time like this. You're both crazy. Scoop queue. The scoop queue provides a list
[2301.37s -> 2306.31s]  of current requests along with relevant information on survivors. If you're able to fulfill the
[2306.31s -> 2311.03s]  objective laid out in the scoop queue before time runs out, you can receive PP or learn more about
[2311.03s -> 2319.40s]  the incident. So if you look at your watch, backup for Brad has more than six hours. If it's yellow,
[2319.40s -> 2322.84s]  it means it's less than six hours. And if it's red, it means it's less than three hours.
[2323.72s -> 2331.35s]  And then if it's gray, there's no time limit at all. Okay, so by setting a guide arrow,
[2331.35s -> 2336.07s]  you'll be able to more easily navigate your way to a given goal. Guide arrows can be set via the
[2336.07s -> 2343.02s]  watch screen or the map screen. Access via the pause menu. Okay, so when you open your watch,
[2343.02s -> 2351.94s]  it'll tell you where to go. Interesting. Backup for Brad. So here we go. Backup for Brad is
[2351.94s -> 2358.90s]  currently selected. I can select. Cut from the same cloth. I got time to do Brad. All right,
[2358.90s -> 2364.42s]  cut from the same cloth is currently on. I can get rid of the coffee creamer. And all right,
[2364.42s -> 2374.95s]  here we go. I'm ready. Let's go. Backup for Brad. No, not backup for Brad. Cut from the same cloth.
[2375.51s -> 2380.02s]  All right, gotta go this way. We have six, less than six hours.
[2383.54s -> 2393.69s]  Holy fuck. I just ended that person. Okay. Is it up top? All right, I gotta go up. Is there an
[2393.69s -> 2408.78s]  escalator stairs? That's fun. Going to the toy store? Oh, not yet. I only have six hours.
[2410.50s -> 2413.86s]  I have six hours to do this. I gotta find the photographer.
[2423.10s -> 2430.95s]  Got it. All right, this person's a gun. Hey you, you're in my way. Can't you see I'm hard at work?
[2430.95s -> 2435.62s]  I'm trying to take some pictures here. You've got a nice camera there yourself, but you know the
[2435.62s -> 2444.04s]  first thing about photography? Uh, yeah. Sorry about that. You know, I happen to be a pro too.
[2444.04s -> 2449.30s]  Maybe not as good as you, but you think you're professional, huh? All right, got you.
[2450.10s -> 2455.05s]  Do you really appreciate the way to the word professional carries? If you don't have the
[2455.05s -> 2464.39s]  talent, you can't just use that word like you own it. All right, so what do I do? Have to give him
[2464.39s -> 2472.52s]  like a good photo? Name's Frank Wesser. I got in way of your shot. I'll just get out of your hair
[2472.52s -> 2478.81s]  now. Okay, okay. Hang on a sec, buddy. Why don't I do you a favor? I'll have a look at your technique
[2478.81s -> 2483.96s]  and give you some pointers. Okay, don't be shy now, Frankie. Here, I'll even model for you.
[2485.05s -> 2489.64s]  Show me what you can do and I'll be the judge. What a great idea, huh? Sometimes I think I'm
[2489.64s -> 2496.92s]  a genius. Let's get started. Well, let's go. I'm on the clock right now. What? When taking photos,
[2496.92s -> 2503.08s]  note that the larger of the target marker, the more PP you will gain from that photo. Also,
[2503.08s -> 2506.76s]  if you manage to take a photo while attacking while being damaged or in some of the non-standard
[2506.76s -> 2512.60s]  status, the target marker will change to red, indicating an increase in potential PP. Okay,
[2514.97s -> 2521.46s]  right. The color of the target marker indicates the genre of the photo. The
[2521.46s -> 2525.62s]  genre that nets the most PP will take precedence over other genres that could be included in said
[2525.62s -> 2533.62s]  photo. Sexually stimulating images, horrifying images, humorous images, emotionally stirring
[2533.62s -> 2541.22s]  and violent images. All right. So, okay, first I want you to take a picture of me while I show
[2541.22s -> 2552.86s]  off my photography skills. What are you doing? Do it. That was fucking quick.
[2557.40s -> 2563.78s]  You did it. Nice job. I took a damn good one. Next, I'll treat you my signature cool pose.
[2563.78s -> 2576.52s]  You get 200, 700 PPs. Okay, what do you say we change the look out? He's going to die. Wait,
[2576.52s -> 2583.30s]  was I? You kind of not give me, you give me like, what are you doing? You're going to get killed.
[2584.26s -> 2603.66s]  He's going to die. Holy shit. That dodge. Get a good one of me. Perfect. No, he's doing like a
[2603.66s -> 2619.02s]  fuck. He didn't get it. Hey, I'm not posing over here for no reason. You got to take it.
[2619.66s -> 2639.40s]  What is he doing? That was not cool. That was really uncool. Okay. No, do you pose? There it is.
[2640.74s -> 2647.50s]  That's not drama. Am I in the frame? Hey, I'm not posing over here. No, you got to take it right.
[2652.17s -> 2670.31s]  Let me take a photo of you, please. All right. That's not his pose. All right. For the love of
[2670.31s -> 2683.70s]  God, stop. Do the thing you want to do. What do you, what do you mean it's no good? I'm not
[2683.70s -> 2710.95s]  posing over here. No, you got to take it. You got to time it right. I need to get 700. This
[2710.95s -> 2726.33s]  vision is wonky. I'm wasting so much fucking time. Stop. Come here. All right. Do your thing.
[2727.13s -> 2748.82s]  No, you're trying to avoid the photo. He's not going to hurt me. That's not 700p. Okay. I have
[2748.82s -> 2766.63s]  to leave. That's not working. He's just going to keep doing this. I have no, no, stop taking a
[2766.63s -> 2779.45s]  photo of me and help me. Help me. Take a picture, man. Don't you even know how I'm going to die.
[2785.77s -> 2794.89s]  What was that? So, okay. What am I doing? What am I doing wrong?
[2795.53s -> 2802.94s]  It doesn't make any sense. So people, everyone told me this was a wonky mission, but I don't
[2802.94s -> 2839.38s]  understand. I need zombies in the photo. Okay. I can't, I'm trying this one more time and I'm
[2839.38s -> 2876.76s]  fucking just going to leave. What the fuck is going on? I just leveled up. I took like 30
[2876.76s -> 2910.36s]  fucking pictures. Why won't this complete? Okay. So is this mission impossible? Dude, my camera's
[2910.36s -> 2916.30s]  out of battery. I did it. Okay. I took, I took, I took a photo of you fucking a hundred times.
[2916.78s -> 2931.21s]  Well, it's in focus and I'm out of battery. Uh huh. That ain't half bad. Okay. Here comes the next
[2931.21s -> 2942.52s]  one, Frankie. But first feast your eyes on my work. Now this is my most emotionally moving shot.
[2946.74s -> 2956.34s]  Now this is my sexiest shot. Uh huh. Uh huh. I have to go to the camera store. Fuck.
[2957.53s -> 2978.30s]  This is my most violent shot. Check it out. I've had a battery battery. Okay. Okay. Here's the deal,
[2978.30s -> 2982.46s]  Frankie. You got to go out there and take even better pictures than the ones I just showed you.
[2982.46s -> 2997.50s]  You think you can handle that? Huh? Yeah. Okay. Did it. So I have no battery in my camera.
[2998.22s -> 3005.08s]  So where's the camera? Where's the battery store? Is it back here? Somebody said the battery store
[3005.08s -> 3013.85s]  was down this way. There's a camera shop. There's a bat, a battery store. It's the first floor. All
[3013.85s -> 3029.53s]  right. That's kids clothing store. Right. Okay. I know. And this is like the funny thing to do.
[3039.69s -> 3045.29s]  Okay. Uh, let me look at the map. Where's the battery store? Okay. Hold on.
[3046.70s -> 3055.02s]  Child's play, kids clothes, jewels, warehouse, shoes, cams, cameras. All right. It's literally
[3055.02s -> 3070.33s]  the next store down to the left. Two stores done. This doesn't do anything. Just get rid of it.
[3070.33s -> 3080.62s]  All right. Here it is down here. Jewelry store, cams, cameras. All right. What do I need? Batteries,
[3080.62s -> 3097.72s]  film. Do I need it? What? How do I get it? Camera store, camera batteries. Were they right at the
[3097.72s -> 3105.61s]  front? No. Oh, to stop. Somebody's barricaded a women's clothing shop. All right. That's fine.
[3105.61s -> 3109.61s]  It's two people are hiding. All right. I'm trying to pick up batteries. Leave me alone. Oh God.
[3109.61s -> 3126.87s]  Damn it, man. Okay. I got scooped. Okay. Please. Oh my fucking God. No, that's not a gun. How do I
[3126.87s -> 3137.10s]  aim the gun? Battery power is depleted. Please charge the batteries. What the fuck? Where are
[3137.10s -> 3148.97s]  the batteries? Batteries. I just was over here. I didn't have an indicator when I went over there
[3148.97s -> 3160.50s]  last time. All right. Let's go to any of my watch. All right. Barricade pair. Hey, let's go that way.
[3161.06s -> 3175.51s]  What are you doing? I hear noise. I need something else besides an apple. I need like a weapon.
[3175.51s -> 3185.30s]  All right. What's in here? Let me go this way. Okay. There's a support store. What about here?
[3185.30s -> 3194.47s]  Anything in here? Like suits? Return clothes. What do I mean by return? Did I just put on a
[3194.47s -> 3210.54s]  pair of socks? Okay. This is I need something to use as a weapon. Okay. A hanger. That works
[3215.02s -> 3221.70s]  this way. Toy store. Wait, people are going to scream at me if I don't go in here.
[3222.58s -> 3234.04s]  All right. What's in the toy store? A novelty mask. Oh, okay. No, I want to change clothes.
[3234.84s -> 3242.41s]  All right. Okay. So I'm gonna put the I'm gonna have this on. I mean, this is this is funny,
[3242.41s -> 3248.54s]  right? You know, I'm doing like the funny thing. Hoomerang. Good. All right. Toy laser sword.
[3250.01s -> 3257.64s]  Um, all right. Replace the coat hanger. I'm ready. This is awesome. It makes a cool noise too.
[3260.18s -> 3267.83s]  Actually, it works pretty well. All right. What's over here? Barricade pair.
[3268.86s -> 3281.11s]  The outside? Where the hell are they? 67 hours. All right. Barricade pair A.
[3284.87s -> 3299.11s]  Oh, wait. Just take a real thing. Use an actual rip. I want. No, it's fine. All right. Backup for
[3299.11s -> 3318.09s]  Brad is still on there. I need to can I go faster than this? Run faster. I know I can run faster
[3318.09s -> 3325.96s]  than this. I need to upgrade. I need to upgrade my speed. So this is another section of the mall.
[3325.96s -> 3336.14s]  Okay. I get it. I need to get more PP. Okay. I got you. Just hold my hand.
[3343.70s -> 3356.09s]  Don't get surrounded. Don't get surrounded. That's stupid. Come on. Wait. I see a lawnmower.
[3356.09s -> 3359.69s]  That's way more important right now. I can get extra PP. I think I'm gonna. Okay. Lawnmower time.
[3360.81s -> 3372.47s]  How do I drive a lawnmower? Do you have to eat a fucking apple?
[3375.14s -> 3383.21s]  Fuck. Okay. I need. Oh, this is bad. This is really bad. Really bad. Who just threw somebody?
[3383.21s -> 3399.10s]  Somebody throw that? How do I drive it? Ah. Shit. Not good. All right. It's over. It's over. It's
[3399.10s -> 3415.19s]  over. Otis. I found somebody in a jewelry shop. Okay. Yeah. It's on. They're in the cutscenes. I
[3415.19s -> 3441.85s]  know. I look like a fucking moron. By the way, how many drugs are you on?
[3442.95s -> 3446.23s]  Ah. Shit load, man. Way too many.
[3469.77s -> 3473.69s]  Stay out of trouble. Are you up to it? I feel like I got picked up at a rave.
[3476.10s -> 3486.31s]  But yeah, I'll give it a shot. All right. Next time he reloads, I'll lay down a suppressing fire.
[3488.15s -> 3497.98s]  Coachella. I'm counting on you. Make your way over there. Okay. One. Let's go. Two. Three.
[3497.98s -> 3522.97s]  Do I have a sneak? Otis. Don't cut me off, Mike. Yeah, it's rude. Nope. That's not gonna work.
[3522.97s -> 3530.84s]  Otis, leave me the fuck alone. Don't cut me off. Anyways, I was saying. I don't know. Whatever
[3530.84s -> 3533.56s]  you're saying. And then somebody in the jewelry store. I know. I found a woman in the jewelry
[3533.56s -> 3564.78s]  shop. Not a good time. Okay. She's moving around an awful lot. All right. Great. Oh, oh, oh. Which
[3564.78s -> 3591.46s]  window? Which window? Where's he going? Which window? Same one. Don't use that many bullets.
[3591.46s -> 3599.30s]  I don't want to use them all. He's got half health. Oh, shit. Shit. Hide. How do I, how do I duck?
[3603.99s -> 3643.29s]  Oh, fuck. God damn it. How did none of those hit? What the fuck? Wait. Frank this. That's a grenade.
[3644.89s -> 3669.50s]  Where'd he go? I'm gonna climb up. No, no, no, no, no. Bad idea. All right. He's almost dead.
[3670.14s -> 3683.06s]  Is he shooting himself? He's shooting himself with a gun. He's gonna kill himself with a grenade.
[3683.54s -> 3693.53s]  What the fuck? Oh, shit. It was a decoy. How many, how many grenades do you have?
[3694.25s -> 3724.62s]  I'm gonna go this way. Wrap around. He's gonna come over here. Run this way. Come on. Over here.
[3725.42s -> 3747.75s]  Bait him out. What is this guy doing? He's burning his hands on the gun. I shot first. Bullshit.
[3751.93s -> 3760.79s]  I, excuse me. I don't understand. Um, I'm in trouble now. I was literally shooting him with
[3760.79s -> 3768.82s]  the gun. Now what the fuck do I do? I'm gonna try, okay, I'm gonna throw the grenade back up
[3768.82s -> 3783.82s]  to him. It's risky, but I'm gonna try it. Is that possible? Throw anything up there?
[3785.34s -> 3801.66s]  Can I throw the cash register up there? Shit. Okay, I think I can do it. Oh, shit. Wait. Corn.
[3802.30s -> 3812.71s]  All right, I'm gonna throw the bottle of Tabasco sauce at him. Right in the skull.
[3813.27s -> 3825.94s]  Where is he? Where is he? Is he still hiding? Can I get up there? What if I could sneak around
[3825.94s -> 3835.00s]  behind him? Wait a minute. I'm going up there. Come on. I can't do it. Let me get up here.
[3835.00s -> 3848.76s]  There's no way for me to climb up this. There has to be, right? Can't reach this. Oh, what about all
[3848.76s -> 3860.25s]  the way around? Yeah, I can get on these boxes, but can I go from here? Can I pick up the boxes?
[3860.25s -> 3887.48s]  I guess I can. Well, I can't go this way. Where the fuck is he? Where did he go? He's gonna unload
[3887.48s -> 3896.25s]  a clip on me. Imagine how embarrassing this would be having a guy sneak up behind you.
[3896.97s -> 3925.94s]  He's not, where is he? Where'd he go? Did he come jump down? He's behind me
[3928.23s -> 3952.36s]  in the restaurant over here. Is he the pair of pants? Is the bare pants? I can't, you can't hit
[3952.36s -> 3978.01s]  the bare pants. Wait, this is fucked up. No, I need a better picture than this. Okay. Just
[3978.01s -> 3983.13s]  leave and come back. Well, I'm going to try to throw a table at the pair of pants. Not the barrel
[3983.13s -> 3999.05s]  right here. All right. I'm going to, I'll just Donkey Kong this guy. How did they, I thought
[3999.05s -> 4009.66s]  I was going to roll it. Just because I say something's going to happen doesn't mean it's
[4009.66s -> 4044.09s]  going to happen. Okay. Kill him. Murder these fucking pants. Oh Jesus. I can't do anything
[4044.09s -> 4053.82s]  about this. That's not the boss. What are you talking about? So is he another pair of pants?
[4054.54s -> 4076.55s]  Okay. I'm going to leave and come out. Can I even leave? Okay. I'm going to leave and then go back
[4076.55s -> 4094.65s]  in. Go look for the angry pants. Okay. Now. All right. Barricade. There he is.
[4098.74s -> 4103.26s]  All right. What? I don't even have a weapon. I got to get a chair up there.
[4104.14s -> 4140.66s]  He just killed himself with a grenade. They've evolved. Wait, why am I still holding a chair?
[4140.66s -> 4150.30s]  What? This motherfucker is still up here. Okay. I've got a chair up there. Chair is up there. I'm
[4150.30s -> 4156.28s]  going to kill him with the fucking chair. I'm sneaking up behind him. I'm going to bash his
[4156.28s -> 4179.94s]  fucking brains in. Where is he? He's gone again. What? If this is a pair of pants down here,
[4179.94s -> 4198.25s]  I'm going to be so mad. Uh, what, what am I supposed to do? What's wrong with my game? I
[4198.25s -> 4205.11s]  don't know. I don't know. I don't know what's going on. I, this is the first time I've ever
[4205.11s -> 4241.06s]  played this. So I leave and come back again. I hear something over here. I've wasted so much time.
[4241.06s -> 4254.28s]  Is he back? Okay. I need to just go up there and punch the fucking shit out of him. Don't,
[4254.28s -> 4264.50s]  don't disappear. Okay. I got to keep my eyes on him. Okay. He's still talking. Good. Good, good,
[4264.50s -> 4267.70s]  good, good, good, good, good. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. He's still up there. He's still up there.
[4267.70s -> 4271.30s]  He's still up there. He's still up there. He's shooting. Good. Excellent. Okay. Great.
[4271.30s -> 4287.67s]  Get this up. Chair up top. God damn it. Did he blow the chair up? I'm just punching him in the face.
[4288.39s -> 4310.60s]  Fuck it. This is ridiculous. Oh, this is so much fucking time wasted. Yeah. He just reloaded too.
[4310.60s -> 4334.20s]  Why did he have to turn into pants? Brad? Where's Brad? Brad? Brad? Brad? Brad? Where's Brad?
[4335.16s -> 4341.72s]  Brad? Food? No, no, no. Go. Food, food, food, food, food, food, food, food, food, food, food, food.
[4341.72s -> 4348.79s]  Brad? Wait, Brad's the pair of pants. Brad's the pants. Brad's the pants. I gotta hide. I gotta
[4348.79s -> 4354.55s]  get the fucking food in here right now. Quick. Am I eating flour? No, eat the corn. Quick.
[4355.35s -> 4377.46s]  What am I doing? No. Okay. I'm just taking like fucking five frying pan. I have to end this.
[4377.46s -> 4386.78s]  I ran out of bullets. This sucks. How am I going to do this? Can I get ammo from Brad?
[4393.53s -> 4400.01s]  Okay. I'm going to spend the next 72 hours here. I can get ammo from Brad, but he sees a pair of
[4400.01s -> 4417.58s]  pants. He can't even talk. Where is he? Brad? I can't even track him down. Where'd he go?
[4419.43s -> 4433.11s]  He's a fucking pair of pants. Okay. Come here. Out of ammo. Take this. God. Holy shit.
[4434.09s -> 4452.86s]  Give me a break. That only took like two to four full hours.
[4453.74s -> 4476.07s]  Okay. Who was that anyway? Well, thanks for your help. The name's Brad. I'm Frank West,
[4476.07s -> 4480.31s]  photojournalist. And right now I'd rather have an explanation than your thanks, Brad.
[4481.51s -> 4495.88s]  You have a gross dad bod. Sorry. I've got nothing to tell you. Look, I do have something to tell you
[4495.88s -> 4502.55s]  what Jesse told you. But as far as I'm concerned, we're through working together. So you cover your
[4502.55s -> 4516.33s]  zombie story and leave the rest to us. You guys are looking for someone here, aren't you? Who is
[4516.33s -> 4529.10s]  that? Where did you take it? You help me, I help you. The rat man. Phylactery lich, $50, 5,000 bits
[4529.10s -> 4538.38s]  from Phylactery. Thanks a lot. Huge money. Damn. Thank you again, Phylactery. You're one hell of
[4538.38s -> 4541.82s]  a journalist, aren't you, Frank? They say all the times I've played this, I've never seen Brad turn
[4541.82s -> 4545.66s]  into a pair of pants. By the way, get used to being on time crunch because you probably won't
[4545.66s -> 4549.98s]  be able to do everything. Nothing better to do than to invade people's privacy. Well, I'm already
[4549.98s -> 4558.20s]  like four hours behind already. I try. You got a point. But thank you for the 5,000 bits though,
[4558.20s -> 4574.79s]  seriously. You win, Frank. Let's work together. Jesse and I are DHS agents. And yes, we are looking
[4574.79s -> 4580.95s]  for the man in that picture. You're with Homeland Security. Is that guy a terrorist or something?
[4581.83s -> 4591.62s]  I took that picture in the entrance plaza. Right near the front door.
[4592.50s -> 4602.07s]  The entrance plaza. You're sure? Hey, I gotta save the picture. Do I have permission to cover this
[4602.07s -> 4619.40s]  story or not? Okay. Case one. All right. Case one three. Engaged. Psychopath defeated. Barricade
[4619.40s -> 4631.42s]  pair A is still live. New skill mastered. You mastered the zombie ride skill. Should I follow
[4631.42s -> 4642.25s]  Brad? Wait, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Picture viewer. Keeping this one. Any
[4642.25s -> 4648.68s]  others that I want to keep? Okay. Just look at this. Look at how many times I did this.
[4648.68s -> 4657.51s]  Wrong. Let's go. I want to, you know what? Fuck it. I want, I want to see. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.
[4659.51s -> 4667.96s]  Wrong, apparently. Wrong. No, they weren't. They were correct. This is the, where's the right one?
[4668.76s -> 4677.46s]  Okay. This is the correct one. This is the wrong one. No, this is the correct one. This one's
[4677.46s -> 4690.58s]  incorrect. I don't, I don't get it. Now let's go Brad. That's a great, I like how it stops.
[4691.62s -> 4702.55s]  All right. I'm going to barricade pair A. I still can do that. Nice shot. All right. This
[4702.55s -> 4715.50s]  people, is Brad just coming with me now? Why are you standing still? You're going to get

[4751.24s -> 4755.96s]  Oh, it's because of the mask. I have a mask on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[4756.68s -> 4768.89s]  It's because of the mask. Hold on. All right. Stay away from me. I am fucking crazy. You know

[4840.68s -> 4849.88s]  Um, shit. How do I get back? How do I get back to the security room? Okay. So here is where we are.
[4850.44s -> 4858.42s]  We got to go. Where the hell is it? Is there a way I can get there faster?

[5075.38s -> 5086.04s]  Oh, it is. Hey, there's a space rider machine in Wonderland. It looks fun. Don't die.
[5088.07s -> 5101.80s]  Fuck everybody. I'm out. Have you ever ridden a roller coaster? I'm gonna die. I can't. I can't.

[5202.17s -> 5206.97s]  second. Space rider machine in Wonderland Plaza looks like it's out of control. That's weird.
[5207.93s -> 5217.35s]  All right. I'm gonna bring it back. So where is the security room? It's somewhere over here,
[5217.35s -> 5225.67s]  isn't it? Oh my God. What the fuck do you want? I didn't even cut you off. You hung up first. You
[5225.67s -> 5239.43s]  hung up on me. You got Alzheimer's or something, man. Okay. Thanks for calling again. All right. I
[5239.43s -> 5248.25s]  need to bring you back. Where's the security room? All right. Look, I need the security room. Where

[5268.86s -> 5273.58s]  my God. Why are we doing this? Sir, if you could just kindly come with us, we can wrap this whole
[5273.58s -> 5280.31s]  thing up. No, I'm leaving until you can guarantee me safe passage. Just open this gate. Just open
[5280.31s -> 5284.39s]  this gate for your protection. I am not opening any gate. He's trying to see through the bottom of
[5284.39s -> 5300.28s]  the mask. Dr. Barnaby. Sir. Dr. Barnaby. Well, what happened? You can't just arrest him.
[5301.26s -> 5305.58s]  He turned down my offer to protect him, said he isn't going anywhere until I can guarantee
[5305.58s -> 5313.46s]  a secure route out of here. Jesse has a direct line to HQ. That's like the first thing we need
[5313.46s -> 5318.26s]  to do in anime. If they, if I was in a costume in anime and somebody said something, it would
[5318.26s -> 5322.02s]  zoom into the inside of the costume and I'd be like, oh my God, I'd have a bunch of reactions in
[5322.02s -> 5339.85s]  here. Somebody gave a 10,000 bits like 10 minutes ago. Oh, that was Gibbler. Thank you for the
[5340.65s -> 5347.13s]  $100. 10,000 bits 10 minutes ago. Hey, Jeremy, I'm so glad to see you playing my favorite game,
[5347.13s -> 5351.21s]  The Thing again. Wait, I was mistaken. Sorry about that. Hope to see you play The Thing again soon.

[5358.52s -> 5364.28s]  there's been huge money drops today already. So thank you all of you. All right, case one,
[5364.28s -> 5370.38s]  we're almost done with case one. Frank, right now you're in the entrance plaza.
[5371.18s -> 5374.94s]  Looks like you got the shutter open. If you want to change it to some fresh duds, just
[5377.98s -> 5395.90s]  hang up on you. What? What did he say? Fresh changes from fresh duds. Can I go up? What did
[5395.90s -> 5404.26s]  he what is it? Was there like a out of control? A temporary agreement was almost done. You're
[5404.26s -> 5413.58s]  almost finished with the first part. Yeah. But so what did he say? Where can I go? I need to like
[5413.58s -> 5424.15s]  get back to the safe zone. Go to Paradise Plaza. Because I know I got to go this way and into the
[5424.15s -> 5432.06s]  right. Because I need to go to the warehouse. Yeah, I got to go to the warehouse. So is it
[5432.06s -> 5437.02s]  this way? Wait, no, it's not. Where the fuck am I going? Is it this way and into the right? Or is
[5437.02s -> 5448.22s]  it up the stairs? Everyone scream if I'm going the wrong way. Alright, everyone's screaming.
[5448.94s -> 5453.93s]  Alright, so no, okay, let's turn around completely. And then it's to the right.
[5454.57s -> 5464.31s]  Okay, so it's up that way. Everyone got timed out because he's going the wrong way.
[5469.26s -> 5478.34s]  So then this way. Can I even get in here? Does this even open? This shit don't even open. I have
[5478.34s -> 5487.48s]  to go up the stairs in that way. Okay. To go all the way back around. Oh shit. Okay. That's annoying.
[5487.48s -> 5491.40s]  Go to the arrow. Well, I'm not. I'm not trying to go to the arrow. I'm trying to go to the
[5492.76s -> 5504.34s]  safe zone. Is that gonna is that taking me to the safe zone? No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[5505.72s -> 5520.14s]  Okay, so where's the from here? Where is it? So now I gotta go. Do I have to do this? Current
[5520.14s -> 5527.29s]  mission is back to the safe zone. So yes, he follows the arrow. Oh, but fuck it's right here.
[5527.85s -> 5535.75s]  So I follow the arrow. I keep getting fucking phone calls. Just go. Okay, I'm just gonna call
[5535.75s -> 5549.74s]  the arrow. The door is welded. It's a dead end. Alright, alright, alright, alright. So I have to
[5549.74s -> 5560.60s]  go back down. I'm getting confused here. Downstairs and then that way. That's the way I was going.
[5561.40s -> 5591.98s]  I'm not gonna throw her off the ledge. What the fuck? Why so dark? Oh, it's because it's
[5591.98s -> 5600.23s]  nighttime. Holy shit. I have like no time left. All right, grandpa. If you but dial me one more
[5600.23s -> 5612.97s]  time, I swear to God. It's like, if I were to go and get my computer infected with a bunch of
[5612.97s -> 5617.69s]  viruses to make sure that I got scam phone calls. And I mean, I mean, go to every website and give
[5617.69s -> 5622.01s]  my phone number to every single website. That is like a scam site. I wouldn't get called this much.
[5622.97s -> 5649.30s]  All right, almost there. Okay, I remember this. I have to go all the way. Wait, wasn't I back here

[5855.69s -> 5869.48s]  of the game. Will load game? Just always load. Always load. This game is not easy. That's all
[5869.48s -> 5874.55s]  right. If you restart, you keep your level. Oh, my God. This is like, I feel like I'm going to pick
[5874.55s -> 5881.54s]  the wrong door here. Do not load. Load the game. Do not save it. Save the game. You idiot. Load it.
[5881.54s -> 5897.03s]  I'm just gonna load game. What? No. Oh, quit without saving. Shit. Save status and quit.
[5898.94s -> 5904.54s]  Oh, my God. This is, this is the most I've ever seen chat. Completely saying three different
[5904.54s -> 5931.14s]  things. Day one. 1357 level three. Whatever. It's done. Holy shit. This is like literally the
[5931.22s -> 5940.79s]  beginning of the game. Oh, my God. Okay. So, speed run time. Holy shit.
[5942.15s -> 5961.02s]  Save the game every 15 minutes. Okay. Hey, welcome everybody. Hope you're having a good day.
[5965.53s -> 5984.46s]  Let's go. Is there a way I can turn the telephone off? I've already seen this. All
[5984.46s -> 5992.18s]  right. We're speed running this. Holy shit. I did not realize that it was this big of a deal.
[5993.14s -> 5996.34s]  There's no autosave or anything. There's no restart from like check. No, it's just,
[5996.34s -> 5999.78s]  it's just maybe this game's like 12 years old. All right. Again. All right. All right. Let's go.
[5999.78s -> 6007.06s]  Let's go. Oh, my God. This is awful. This is really bad. I did. Okay. I didn't realize how awful this
[6007.06s -> 6010.58s]  was. This is, this is like a catastrophe, but it's not, I'm fine. Everything's gonna be fine.
[6010.58s -> 6022.65s]  It wasn't that bad. I know exactly where I'm going. Back up for Brad. What? I can't get in here?
[6023.37s -> 6032.94s]  No, I know there wasn't an autosave, but I didn't realize that like it, it wasn't,
[6032.94s -> 6037.34s]  it was kind of, oh, I don't know. I thought I could like potentially start at like where,
[6037.34s -> 6041.74s]  I have no idea. This game's hardcore. So we're going to treat it that way. How did you even
[6041.74s -> 6047.30s]  grab me? That's right. What? I don't understand. Where'd you even come from? What? All right. Back
[6047.30s -> 6053.77s]  up for Brad. Let's go. Photo guy. Photo quest. All right. I'll get, where was that? Up top?
[6054.49s -> 6059.53s]  I don't remember. I'm so disjointed right now. I'm like right now, I am so miserably sad,
[6060.49s -> 6064.57s]  but I'm bottling it up. I'm just, I just drank it. I just gulped it down. It's going to come out
[6064.57s -> 6067.69s]  as diarrhea in like fucking four hours, but we're good. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. We're good.
[6067.69s -> 6074.92s]  We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good. Hey, what's going on, man? No, that's the wrong
[6074.92s -> 6082.20s]  one. Yeah. I can, I can take photos. I'm going to get it immediately. First try. Yeah. I'll do it.
[6086.98s -> 6095.69s]  Oh my God. I'm saving the game. Literally. I want everyone to scream in this chat.
[6097.50s -> 6114.54s]  Like I want it to only say, save the game every 20 minutes. All right, let's go. Okay.
[6115.78s -> 6126.14s]  Photo time. Model for you. Yep. I'll be able to get through this very quickly.
[6129.67s -> 6135.19s]  Okay. Here we go. Take a photo. Look at all these cool things. Awesome. Huh? Show me your skills.
[6135.19s -> 6144.31s]  Got it. Nice, huh? That's no good, man. Got you. Okay. Cool. Food. Give me some pies.
[6146.62s -> 6155.19s]  What? Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Cool pose. Cool pose. Here it is. No, I fucking didn't,
[6155.19s -> 6163.80s]  I didn't mean to press X. All right. Here we go. One, two, three, take it. And I did it wrong.
[6164.36s -> 6168.44s]  It's gotta be right when he pumps his fist. Don't run away. No, I'm not reliving the same
[6168.44s -> 6172.78s]  thing that just happened. Please God. I don't want to do the whole thing again. I just want,
[6172.78s -> 6178.98s]  it's right when his fist goes down. We just did this like this whole stream.
[6206.25s -> 6215.10s]  Do it. What are you doing? I'm just reliving the same day. Take it.
[6218.49s -> 6222.44s]  That's not, it's a different, that was a different pose. Oh, you've got to be
[6222.44s -> 6227.80s]  fucking kidding me. This is fucking Groundhog Day. Give me a break. Okay. Please do it.
[6248.26s -> 6249.06s]  Got it.
[6272.02s -> 6275.70s]  Get the kick. Yeah. It's like, it's a half, it's like a tenth of a second.
[6276.66s -> 6306.50s]  It's 3000 points. Okay. Good. See you later. Okay. Bye. Damn it, man. I, I already did this.
[6306.50s -> 6314.22s]  Why did I not? I'm gonna make a post-it note that says like, oh, no, no.
[6316.30s -> 6332.89s]  And I have to do this stupid ass mission again. What is, what the fuck? Why, man?
[6332.89s -> 6345.13s]  And that was perfect. He's covering his face. Cool. Good.
[6349.86s -> 6358.04s]  Thanks. Save the game now. Where's our safe point? I want to say point now, right now.
[6358.76s -> 6377.94s]  There's not even one around me. There's a bathroom. Where's the bathroom? No bathroom here. Oh, what?
[6379.54s -> 6383.62s]  Why is that not the default? Oh God. It's not, it's first floor. Okay. First floor.
[6383.62s -> 6389.78s]  Go down. Bathroom. First floor. Let's go. All right. Brad, you're gonna have to just wait a
[6389.78s -> 6403.42s]  minute. I'm gonna do this correct. All right. Bathroom. Where's the, where's the bathroom?
[6405.30s -> 6415.56s]  Not that way. Not that way. Where is it? It's behind me. It's just behind me. And what, up the
[6415.56s -> 6431.58s]  stairs? It's all the way down. What do you mean blind? I couldn't see through here. What are you
[6431.58s -> 6452.12s]  talking about? All right. We're good. Give me this. Good. Change clothes. Who cares? All right. Here
[6452.12s -> 6462.78s]  we go, Brad. I'm ready. All right. So I gotta remember it's a cross from Bachman's Bookporium.
[6463.34s -> 6470.34s]  Oh, all right. That's the comedy thing. Didn't know that. All right. Let's go, Brad.
[6471.14s -> 6487.78s]  God damn it. I'm so sad. I'm so sad. My words can't describe my sadness.
[6488.66s -> 6495.14s]  I missed the katana. It's all right. I need to, I need to get to the point where I just was.
[6497.30s -> 6506.79s]  Any bosses yet? I think there's been two, but we've rewound an hour and 40 minutes. I blame,
[6507.35s -> 6515.69s]  I blame, what was her name? Lucy? I had two guys that had like weapons and then they both died
[6515.69s -> 6526.50s]  because we were rescuing Lucy from the jewelry store. And then I got run over by a car. Did I
[6526.50s -> 6542.26s]  beat the thing? Oh yeah. I'm going to be under leveled, under leveled. Wait, this is my opportunity.
[6542.26s -> 6547.54s]  This is a new timeline so I can try the, I always said flamethrower. New timeline. All right. How
[6547.54s -> 6564.31s]  do you work it? You have to hold X. Okay. Good. Okay. Good. I'll make it up for the lost PP that
[6564.31s -> 6589.54s]  I had. Where's the knife? I need that knife. All right. Let's go. All right. Get off. And
[6590.34s -> 6598.86s]  another one with the knife. Where's the knife? Right there. Just don't waste bullets. Just grab
[6598.86s -> 6616.55s]  the knife. All right. I'm up. It's only 67 hours left. Okay. I have some extra PP. Get through. Oh,
[6616.55s -> 6624.98s]  you fucker. Come on. No, don't. Food core. Here we go. All right. I'm ready.
[6625.62s -> 6634.33s]  Not going to screw this up. I'm just going to win. Don't just fire, fire, fire, fire, fire. I have
[6634.33s -> 6650.78s]  two guns. You can't even hurt it. You can't even hit him. He's unhittable until he stands up.
[6650.78s -> 6684.49s]  Where's he at? Fast. Just do it and I'll be almost there. Ammo. Where'd he go? He's over here, right?
[6686.97s -> 6702.60s]  Rad ammo. Holy shit. Wait, that's fun. Hold on. That's fun. That's fun. I want to do that.
[6703.24s -> 6710.22s]  You know, this is actually going to be a good thing because I'll beat him quickly.
[6710.78s -> 6765.66s]  Okay. I didn't hit him with any. Is he healing? What the fuck was that? Oh, almost dead. Almost
[6765.66s -> 6769.22s]  dead. It's okay. It's all right. Don't worry. I would say. All right. All right. All right.
[6769.22s -> 6787.14s]  Don't be fucking greedy and cocky here. Heal just in case. It's this. It's this. It's this. It's
[6787.14s -> 6804.66s]  the success ringing of the telephone. It's like, I just leave me alone. Why would I answer this
[6804.66s -> 6833.56s]  phone call right now? Ammo please. Okay. Thanks for the tip. Right. I know. But scoops. Cool.
[6833.56s -> 6853.72s]  Great. Can I have ammo? Thank you. Somebody just like tap. Okay. Somebody just muted by stream and
[6853.72s -> 6877.34s]  then unmuted it. This game is freaking me out. Okay. Go. Where's the safe point? Right here.
[6877.34s -> 6883.46s]  There are sanity effects in the game. That's not true. Okay. Safe point. Right here. Out.
[6883.46s -> 6914.66s]  Bang of right. This is a place called flexing. You got it. Yeah. Flexing. Where is it? Okay. It's
[6914.66s -> 6933.35s]  out. It's going to go this way straight and this is right. Flexing. There it is. How do I save it?
[6933.35s -> 6955.08s]  I have almost officially caught up with myself. Whoa. Okay. I have weapons. I'm going to try to
[6955.08s -> 6976.92s]  save everybody now. I think I'm just going to leave Lucy. Watch it. Watch it. Okay. Where are
[6976.92s -> 6985.21s]  they at? Do I even have that data? I do. They're right here. Okay. All right guys. Come on out.
[6990.76s -> 6999.90s]  No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. Get. They're in a different store. They're in this store
[6999.90s -> 7015.14s]  right here. They have food in here too. I need these two. Okay. This guy freaks out. I remember.
[7015.78s -> 7041.82s]  Oh fuck. Okay. Let's go. Give me your food. Everyone's all good. Knock it off.
[7042.54s -> 7059.48s]  Talk to me or kill me. Okay. All right. Aaron. Let's go. Good. Join the party. Bert Thompson
[7059.48s -> 7068.14s]  has joined. I'm taking all the food. Okay. You take this. All right. Now you take. Yeah.
[7069.42s -> 7078.52s]  You take dumbbell. Okay. Give me the bat. No. You idiot. Why don't you eat those? Here. Take the.
[7079.08s -> 7083.62s]  Come here. You have to get out of the way. Those are my rice crispy treats.
[7084.26s -> 7093.48s]  All right, fellas. You ready? No. Give me that. You got it. No. You give me this.
[7094.36s -> 7120.57s]  I. Well, it doesn't matter. Let's go. Three Stooges episode. Bert. Aaron. Anytime now. Did you block
[7120.57s -> 7131.05s]  you? They've rebarricaded the door. You idiots. Idiocy. At its finest here. My fucking god. I just
[7131.05s -> 7174.01s]  ate the. Get out of the store, please. All right. Come on. Good. Keep going. We're gonna get. Nice
[7174.01s -> 7195.03s]  job, Aaron. Poor Bert. I don't even know who it was. Guys. What about Leah? I don't care.
[7204.06s -> 7210.89s]  No, that's. Is it food in here? It's a restaurant. There has to be food in here. Cooking oil.
[7212.63s -> 7222.86s]  Nope. Here we go. Orange juice. Drink the cooking oil. I'm not going to drink it.
[7223.58s -> 7258.49s]  Let's go. Good. We both made it. Here we are. Both here. Everyone here. Found somebody in the
[7258.49s -> 7264.81s]  jewelry shop. Oh, did you? Oh, just missed it. So she's looking for somebody. Just missed it.
[7265.61s -> 7327.35s]  What she called earlier. Let's go. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know.
[7331.22s -> 7346.18s]  Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. I know. I know. I know. You got separated from the kid. I know it's bad.
[7346.98s -> 7350.26s]  Aaron. That's my baby. I know. Okay. Yep. Yes.
[7354.89s -> 7366.87s]  We'll help you. Come on. Aaron. They ate her. Okay. Yes. Oh, God. I know. Goodness.
[7370.54s -> 7374.49s]  Good. Thank you. Stick around for a little bit. I don't have any more weapons.
[7375.05s -> 7380.57s]  Okay. Sure. Come on. I'm not gonna let you die here. All right. And three, two, one. Action.
[7381.53s -> 7399.80s]  How do I get out of here? You... Guys, how do you...
[7417.77s -> 7430.07s]  Just trapped in here. He's just facepalming. Get away from the counter. Come on. Stop. I trapped
[7430.07s -> 7463.06s]  him. I'm gonna scream. Does she not know how to climb? How do I get her out of here? Let's go.
[7463.78s -> 7482.47s]  You guys are the ones that have the weapons. Fellas. Oh, my God. What are we doing here?
[7483.43s -> 7509.83s]  Are they seriously stuck there? They are. Brad, I'm... I traded.
[7511.35s -> 7520.15s]  Fuck. No. Go... You go over there and stay over there?
[7536.06s -> 7553.77s]  I can get there in time. Where the hell are they? Where are they? Where are they?
[7567.32s -> 7577.72s]  He's just falling. Let's go this way. Me? To me. To me. This is un-fucking-believable. I'm gonna
[7577.72s -> 7599.51s]  throw a sofa in there. I have to throw a chair or something at him. I'm gonna get trapped in here.
[7600.86s -> 7629.24s]  Can I pick him up? Yes, I saw this already. Go that way. How do I just punch? That's why. Come
[7629.24s -> 7640.50s]  this way. This AI. Holy shit. You guys are brainless. Finally, Brad. Bert, you got up.
[7641.06s -> 7643.91s]  I wonder... All right. Good. Nice work, everybody. Now move.
[7644.87s -> 7651.58s]  Don't care. Go. Come on. You can do it. You can do it. You can do it. Come on.
[7652.30s -> 7655.34s]  I got orange juice when you're done. Give me that weapon. Trade me.
[7660.06s -> 7665.21s]  Heal with the orange juice. All right. Let's go. Let's go. Out. Out, out, out, out, out, out, out.
[7665.21s -> 7671.61s]  Leia's being attacked. I swear to God, if I die here, I am going to fucking throw them. Throw them.
[7671.61s -> 7685.35s]  What's wrong with me? He's got his hands on his fucking hips. This is un-fucking-believable.
[7685.35s -> 7711.32s]  Who cares? This is on. They won't listen to me. They got stuck behind the kiosk in the jewelry
[7711.32s -> 7716.12s]  store, and they wouldn't come out. Oh, no. The original timeline is happening now.
[7716.12s -> 7729.56s]  They would have had full health. I don't care. Fucking idiots couldn't figure out how to walk
[7729.56s -> 7741.48s]  over a jewelry counter. Should have just left you. You're supposed to drink the orange juice, Bart.
[7742.20s -> 7766.63s]  Okay. Where's the bathroom? Save point is behind me. I think we just have to get through this.
[7774.90s -> 7780.02s]  Reload? What, for somebody else to get stuck in a store and then two people die or one person dies?
[7784.97s -> 7790.58s]  Sir, if you could just kindly come with this whole thing. I'm not doing another reset.
[7790.66s -> 7799.29s]  Until you can guarantee me. There we go. Here we are. Done. Temporary agreement. Let's talk.
[7799.85s -> 7803.40s]  I'm at entrance plaza. Yes, I am. We're safe for now.
[7806.02s -> 7812.34s]  Take what you need from the clothing store. You got it. All right. Here, Bert. Give me that.
[7812.34s -> 7819.59s]  Drink that. Give me this cooking oil. Okay, whatever. I don't know why my brain is like
[7819.59s -> 7831.19s]  this. I thought that said one of seven killed in the corner. Okay, I am going to go and get
[7831.19s -> 7838.49s]  some fresh clothing. What is that? We have to go. We have to walk all the way around.
[7841.72s -> 7847.14s]  Save the game. But I don't even know what the save point is. I have to just go there.
[7847.78s -> 7862.12s]  Just follow Brad. He doesn't know. If only there was a map. Yeah, but the save points are like,
[7863.64s -> 7872.94s]  here, look. Okay. So if I go up, I guess I could, I have to go this way. So no, I am going this way.
[7873.10s -> 7886.46s]  I can save. I'm saving the game. I can't even go this way. I'm going to piss my pants. Speaking
[7886.46s -> 7895.45s]  of pissing. No, I, I, everyone was like, you got it. You have to just do the thing. You have
[7895.45s -> 7911.40s]  to go the right to go this way. Go to the running guy icon on the map. What the fuck does that do?
[7911.40s -> 7923.19s]  There's a safe point right here. Otto. Otto's in here with me. I don't have that. Why are
[7923.19s -> 7937.82s]  you guys giving me bogus info? Okay. Where's the safe point? It's right here. All right.
[7937.82s -> 7949.26s]  It's just flexing. Make it to flexing. Let's go. Move it. Did you just trip?
[7953.66s -> 7959.77s]  No, you know what, Aaron? You come over here. Give me that bat. You're useless with that thing.
[7961.64s -> 7965.91s]  My God, you are so useless. Just go ahead and stand there.
[7968.09s -> 7975.21s]  Bat. These guys are so bad. Give me your bat. Give me the bat. You take the cooking oil.
[7979.51s -> 7982.55s]  Take your, take the cooking oil. I don't care what you do with it. Just fuck off.
[7983.43s -> 8018.71s]  All right. Where's flexing? Almost level six. All right. Flexing. Time to save the game.
[8027.56s -> 8033.42s]  Guys, are they dead? No, they're standing around in circles, bumping into stuff. Look at,
[8033.42s -> 8049.45s]  look at their icons. Just in case. All right. Where you guys at?
[8049.45s -> 8087.29s]  What are you guys doing? What is he holding? There's only so much I can do.
[8088.17s -> 8102.58s]  You guys are just walking into stuff. Like, do these guys just die? Like, why are they,
[8102.58s -> 8118.06s]  why is this so difficult? Oh, fuck the both of you. What is going on right now?
[8121.35s -> 8126.87s]  Frank, I need help over here. Frank. Frank. Oh, I'm just walking into walls. Frank. Frank.
[8127.83s -> 8134.71s]  Frank, help me. Fuck you, Bert. A waste of time.
[8147.26s -> 8158.74s]  Damn it, man. It doesn't even make any fucking sense. Well, I, now I have no one. Before I had
[8158.74s -> 8176.01s]  Leah. What is it? Frank, you're on the food court. Yeah. Okay. Try mixing different food in the
[8176.01s -> 8190.63s]  blenders. What are you talking about? Mix the food in the blenders? I mean, this is still,
[8190.63s -> 8207.99s]  where's the blender? Actually, a lot of wine here. Microwave? Oh, I can't even cook food? This is
[8207.99s -> 8221.10s]  strange. Okay. I don't see a blender on the other side. I can't believe everybody's dead.
[8227.06s -> 8241.19s]  Corn. Zucchini. Okay. Any blenders? Another store, maybe? I'll check another store.
[8247.35s -> 8252.73s]  Taco shop right here. I mean, a coffee shop would have a blender, wouldn't it?
[8255.22s -> 8264.97s]  Oh, is it a blender? Okay. Um, examine. Juice power. Insert two food items into a mixer and
[8264.97s -> 8269.61s]  you can create your own original juice concoction. Different color juices possess different properties
[8269.61s -> 8284.81s]  and effects. So, um, I need to get different juice. What just came up? Juice. Quick step. What?
[8287.16s -> 8310.84s]  Hold on. I'm cooking oil and wine. Pick it up. All right. So is this just temporary? This is just
[8310.84s -> 8319.66s]  temporary thing, right? That's cool. I'll figure out some stuff to do later. Mixed drinks will
[8319.66s -> 8331.05s]  fully heal you. Okay. That's cool. That's super useful. Um, I'll have to figure that out later
[8331.05s -> 8338.79s]  when I have more health. Put corn in there. Oh, wait. What's this? Yogurt. Okay. Yogurt.
[8340.28s -> 8358.92s]  Yogurt and ice pops. What'd I get? A quick step. Cool. Entire box. All right. I have, I need,
[8358.92s -> 8378.79s]  okay. What do I have for? All right. I'm good. Get off the counter. All right. I gotta go.
[8379.43s -> 8384.81s]  Yeah, this is Frank. Space rider machine and wonderland pizza. Looks like it's out of control.
[8385.85s -> 8401.56s]  Maybe there's somebody out there. Go there. I'm just going to let it talk.
[8402.66s -> 8405.38s]  It's, I know it's a, I know. Let them talk about the phone.
[8406.18s -> 8424.50s]  Uh, using the dumbbell as a phone. Use the quick step. All right. I'll save Sophie. Maybe not.
[8424.50s -> 8431.98s]  Should I do the quick step? What does it do? I'm gonna see what it does. Holy shit. That's
[8431.98s -> 8444.78s]  unbelievable. Oh my God. This is the best thing ever. Sophie, come here. Let's go. Come here.
[8445.82s -> 8458.42s]  Can you run as fast as me? Take one. What? Oh, do I go faster? I can't just take holder and just
[8458.42s -> 8466.10s]  drag and run. No, go this way. They're in the, they're in the thing where they're driving to.
[8466.66s -> 8486.36s]  Can they shoot that far? All right. Ladies and gentlemen, we have made it to the portion where
[8486.36s -> 8512.63s]  I've had to rewind to now. All right. We're good. This way. People dance. This is kind of a people
[8512.63s -> 8532.76s]  dance, isn't it? Just open the door. All right. Let's go. Come here. All right. Where's the save?
[8532.76s -> 8552.92s]  Save point is to the left and down the hall. Do I even have any weapons? Pretty good dodges.
[8571.58s -> 8599.75s]  I don't have any fucking items. Oh, yes, I do. Come here. Um, just go to the whatever. I need
[8599.75s -> 8610.20s]  to close. Anything in the urinals? Come here. I don't even need to hold your hand. Why am I
[8610.20s -> 8636.76s]  doing that? Okay. We're good. Fucking itchy eyeball. Nice push. I have no weapons at all.
[8636.76s -> 8647.80s]  Bad. Give me that back. Let's go. All right. Now I got to go to the save, the safe zone,
[8648.52s -> 8658.95s]  which is hold her hand. She's hilarious. She'll be fine. All right. Safe zone is down this way.
[8658.95s -> 8677.02s]  Okay. I think that's just where we're going. Let's go. Nice hit. Wash my hands. There's no time for
[8677.02s -> 8684.25s]  that. I'm sorry, guys. But in a scenario like this, you're going to wash your hands.
[8686.23s -> 8689.91s]  You're not going to go to the bathroom to pee. You're just going to go over there and just piss
[8689.91s -> 8703.19s]  all over the wall as fast as you possibly can. You're still going to use the bathroom. Good.
[8703.19s -> 8717.83s]  All right. This way. All right. There's the exit. Let's go. Damn. Not washing hands is exactly how
[8717.83s -> 8723.80s]  a zombie apocalypse starts. But if it's already happening, then there's no it's already over.
[8724.60s -> 8767.11s]  Oh shit. Got it. You killed them. Whoa. What a plot is developing right in front of us.
[8767.91s -> 8773.69s]  There's a zombie playing host to a queen parasite in every large gathering of zombies.
[8773.69s -> 8779.29s]  Defeat that zombie and get your hands on the queen to use it as an item. Queen infected zombie.
[8779.85s -> 8786.42s]  Capture the queen. So they're the ones with the red eyes. Found a couple of survivors in the
[8786.42s -> 8791.83s]  bookstore in Wonderland Plaza. What was that thing? They looked Japanese. Probably tourists.
[8791.83s -> 8814.38s]  Okay. All right. Let's go. Follow me. I brought somebody. I got a survivor. Oh, queen. Get out
[8814.38s -> 8831.34s]  of the way. This guy just puked in my mouth. Hold on. I want to get a good one of that. Turn
[8831.34s -> 8854.58s]  around and do a big shove and action. Turn around and shove the zombie. Go for it. She just pushed
[8854.58s -> 8885.66s]  me. Every time I put the camera down. Give me the queen. Let's go. I'm taking this. All right. I have
[8885.66s -> 8899.75s]  somebody to deliver. Oops. Do I get money if it's a fake person? What if it's just a mannequin?
[8901.30s -> 8911.45s]  And then I can save the game. There we are. Let's go. Sophie Richards. I can't believe those maniacs
[8911.45s -> 8916.94s]  killed him. I never got a chance to tell how I feel. Very good. Escort complete. Level seven
[8916.94s -> 8927.74s]  reached. 24,000 pp. Extra life cube. Nice. All right. This is the next part of the game.
[8933.14s -> 8939.83s]  So that's what Dr. Barnaby said, huh? The old coot's not dumb. He wants us to call for help first.
[8940.47s -> 8952.94s]  We got to line out or what? The signal's being blocked. I can't even contact HQ on the emergency
[8952.94s -> 8957.58s]  line. Still in the same costume. I was right. We want to get our hands on Dr. Barnaby. We're
[8957.58s -> 8963.13s]  gonna have to secure a way out of here ourselves. All right. We've got to deal with the situation
[8963.13s -> 8967.29s]  we've been handed. The boneheads back at HQ might be working on something, too.
[8968.17s -> 8974.89s]  There's a thing to save every single person, right? Can you imagine how annoying that would be?
[8977.10s -> 8985.14s]  At noon, it's my ride. Is your ride reliable? Absolutely. That's how I plan on getting out
[8985.14s -> 8992.82s]  of here. All right, then. I'll see to it that the DHS picks up the charter fee. Can we take Dr.
[8992.82s -> 9000.10s]  Barnaby as well? Sure. As long as you tell me what's going on. Okay. I'll tell you what you want to know.
[9000.98s -> 9007.72s]  Later. We have more pressing business right now. All right. If we have to wait here for three days,
[9007.72s -> 9013.96s]  we'll need supplies. Water, blankets, and the like. We'll get Dr. Barnaby here tomorrow morning.
[9013.96s -> 9020.54s]  I want you to keep an eye on the monitors. How much money would it take me to save everybody?
[9020.54s -> 9028.18s]  It just wouldn't happen. All right. That's the first case completed. The next case will occur
[9028.18s -> 9036.17s]  at 6 a.m. Oh, man. What time is it? Okay, so I got some time. All right. I need to save the game,
[9036.17s -> 9052.25s]  then I have to pee. Oh, it's out the other way. Why is my eye so itchy? I want like a new pair of eyes.
[9052.89s -> 9067.85s]  Let's go pee on the wall quick. All right, we're good. Image in the monitor. Oh, right. All right.
[9067.85s -> 9305.58s]  I'll be right back. I'm just gonna pee. I'll be a minute, two minutes. See you in a second. All right. Okay.
[9306.46s -> 9323.42s]  Crisis averted. Where I was. Okay. All right. So I have some time. Should I go for it? Should I try?
[9323.42s -> 9329.74s]  No, you can't even do it. What about like food and shit? Don't they leave stuff lying around?
[9330.86s -> 9342.60s]  Didn't wash hands? I didn't have time to do that. There's Jeff and Natalie. See, I'm saving people.
[9343.69s -> 9352.54s]  I'm not doing terrible. I think I'm good. Yeah, there's nothing else. And this is where just they,
[9352.54s -> 9358.54s]  all the survivors go. I get it. I have a queen. I have the drink and I need something
[9359.34s -> 9373.85s]  that Apple's probably better. It's good. It looks good. Time to go. Wait, image on the monitor,
[9374.57s -> 9379.67s]  but the zombies going berserk like this. I don't, the press is going to go in. You know what I'm
[9379.67s -> 9383.59s]  saying? Sorry to get involved in all this, Frank. You might want to consider spending the night here.
[9387.19s -> 9397.32s]  Image in the monitor. Kind of running out of time on this one. Image in the monitor. Where the hell
[9397.32s -> 9411.58s]  are you trying to get me to go? Image in the monitor. Can't do it. Okay. Photo to out of
[9411.58s -> 9428.36s]  control. All right, Japanese tourists. Let's go. I have time. Otis, stop calling me. Okay, let's go
[9432.54s -> 9453.88s]  back down. No, no, that's kind of, how can you guys still use the elevator? Kill, kill, kill them,
[9453.88s -> 9469.67s]  kill them. I'm trying. How did they all get down here? I saw somebody in the North Plaza. He was
[9469.67s -> 9475.13s]  leaving the supermarket. Yep. He was in a real panic. Something must be happening. Don't hang
[9475.13s -> 9501.59s]  up on me. Oh, just, I'm just Otis. Can you and I, can I just keep the line open? Just keep your
[9501.59s -> 9513.05s]  phone turned on. I'll keep my phone turned on. You can just talk to me. Anyways, here's what I was
[9513.05s -> 9519.27s]  saying. Go ahead. Say what you need to say. North Plaza, leaving the supermarket, right? He's in a
[9519.27s -> 9534.89s]  panic. I know. Something's after him. Good. Cool. Is this the shoes? I need, like, I need a new
[9534.89s -> 9551.72s]  costume. I can't just have a pair of, like, sneakers. Dermot, you're Otis's only friend.
[9555.06s -> 9561.62s]  Well, whatever. I can't be. I got stuff going on. I got stuff to do. I can't just take every one of
[9561.62s -> 9581.11s]  your phone calls. Eat that. Eat that, bro. Okay, give me the knife. Just tried to stab me. Almost
[9581.11s -> 9597.10s]  got it too. What's in here? Pant and barrels. New shirts. New anything. I need anything else besides
[9597.10s -> 9609.13s]  this t-shirt. No, here we go. Sure. All right. What are we at? Let's see what we got going on here.
[9611.94s -> 9621.72s]  Uh, there, what's this question mark? What, what's that mean? Question mark. Does that mean the
[9621.72s -> 9635.45s]  person's here? Why is there a question mark over here? Book. Engineering. The act of holding a book
[9635.53s -> 9639.13s]  is enough to activate its properties. Different books have different effects.
[9640.47s -> 9645.11s]  PP gain from photography or defeating zombies is increased, and learn skateboarding or cycling
[9645.11s -> 9652.15s]  tricks or valuable skills that can make the escorting of survivors easier. Some books have
[9652.15s -> 9655.75s]  an effect on other items in your possession. Items affected by these books are marked with
[9656.39s -> 9663.14s]  a book icon. Restored power of food consumption is boosted with a heal plus. Multiple books can
[9663.14s -> 9668.09s]  be held in tandem to further increase the bonus. Items covered in a book's contents
[9668.09s -> 9675.11s]  experience an appreciable increase to the durability. Okay, so what? Engineering.
[9678.02s -> 9706.55s]  Engineering? What's the plus? Press X on the book. Hold on. Item plus. Hold on to tools and
[9706.55s -> 9712.47s]  construction related items. Three, three times as long. Okay, so tools and construction items.
[9713.19s -> 9723.86s]  What is that? What counts as a construction item? Wood. Is a knife, knife, a tool. Oh, great. These
[9723.86s -> 9753.27s]  guys again. Quick step. Not a bad idea. It's actually kind of to the beat of the song.
[9753.27s -> 9781.06s]  Holy shit. They came out of nowhere. No. Oh my god. Bad. Bad. Bad. Oh.
[9786.68s -> 9796.62s]  Fuck. Oh, that hurts. That hurts. No, come on. This is bullshit. This is actual bullshit.
[9797.50s -> 9819.00s]  Get it. Thank god. All right, get rid of the uh, get rid of the bat. I want more health.
[9819.72s -> 9840.34s]  This is a tool, right? Okay, where are these tourists? This way. They'll be marked with a
[9840.34s -> 9860.79s]  purple book icon. Oh, that's cool. Hitbox. Okay, we're looking for the tour. Frank, you're in
[9860.79s -> 9868.30s]  Wonderland Plaza. The most popular attraction is the space rider roller coaster. The I can't move.
[9868.30s -> 9890.20s]  I can't move. I can't move. I can't move. All right, who made the roller coaster tycoon ride
[9891.29s -> 9905.75s]  where you can't get off of it? Is somebody on it? That's really fast. All right, where are the
[9905.75s -> 9922.17s]  tourists? Well, I need to get something from here. Run like the wind. Shoe store. Just a hat.
[9922.17s -> 9939.80s]  What about new sneakers? Yeah, sure. I need a lot of shoe stores. I gotta get this shirt off.
[9939.80s -> 9948.15s]  I've had the same shirt on the whole game. This is a default clothing. Bowling balls. I can't pick
[9948.15s -> 9958.78s]  up the bowling balls. All right, sporting goods. Hanger. Worthless. Tennis racket. No. All right.
[9958.78s -> 9978.22s]  Here we go. Right. Skateboard. Oh, a skateboard. I can use it. How do I use it? Okay, you just use
[9978.22s -> 10000.34s]  the skateboard. This is awesome. That's all I can do. All right. Tourists. Here comes another one.
[10002.89s -> 10011.93s]  Hello? Can you get... Hey, hey, easy. Talk? How do we... Can I talk? Oh, wait, what's this book?
[10012.57s -> 10023.26s]  What does this one do? Learn to speak rudimentary Japanese. Hey, I can... Listen. Wait. I'm different.
[10023.26s -> 10034.73s]  Not one of them. Who are you? Frank, photograph taker, journalist. Are you go safe? What? Oh,
[10034.73s -> 10046.34s]  shit. Hold on. How do I just attack without drinking? Can I use the ball? I need something to throw.
[10046.34s -> 10054.58s]  I need something. Anything. This... Just apples. What is this? What does this do? Hold on to edged
[10054.58s -> 10064.25s]  weapons three times as long. I need the Japanese one. All right. Give me the register. No, not this.
[10064.25s -> 10074.87s]  Give me the register. Somebody's... He's gonna die. One zombie is gonna kill this guy. Move.
[10084.33s -> 10096.98s]  Move. Think seriously first, friend. What kind of journalist would come here for a story? There's
[10096.98s -> 10101.78s]  clearly something wrong with this man. Wait. I know Japanese. She'll hear you. I can... I know
[10101.78s -> 10107.06s]  Japanese. Don't worry. His Japanese sucks. He won't understand. We can't very well stay here by
[10107.06s -> 10113.34s]  ourselves, can we? Let's just follow him for now but remain suspicious of his tricks. This is all
[10113.34s -> 10118.55s]  your fault. Of all the places to vacation, why were you so keen on this dump? What? The other
[10118.55s -> 10127.64s]  one who said it would be a good time. Anybody want a drink? Anyone there? So you're gonna follow?
[10128.36s -> 10135.45s]  Okay. What's this? What is this book? Skateboarding. Okay. I got a skateboarding book.
[10140.92s -> 10159.40s]  You coming? I need the Japanese book, don't I? Where is it? I have it already? No, I don't.
[10161.37s -> 10171.82s]  Skateboard. Is it... What's the... Talk more than once? I don't have an option to because I don't
[10171.82s -> 10182.10s]  have the Japanese book on me anymore. I can't talk. Where the hell is the Japanese book? There it is.
[10182.10s -> 10191.72s]  Okay. Come here. There we go. Come. No. Come. Decide quickly, please.
[10192.68s -> 10205.00s]  Fantastic. Pardon our rudeness. Here she'll go. Got it. All right. They both joined. I don't have
[10205.00s -> 10220.46s]  any weapons though. I got a new skill. Kick back skill. That's so easy to do that. To just
[10220.46s -> 10233.54s]  accidentally drink the fucking thing. Health book. That guy's almost dead. Here, take some snacks.
[10233.54s -> 10246.87s]  How many sloths do you guys have? Come here. Drunk skateboarder. All right. You guys are good?
[10247.59s -> 10255.99s]  I need to get rid of this. Like, seriously. You know, I know what this does. By the way,
[10256.87s -> 10261.06s]  I've been watching somebody play this like 10 years ago and I know what this does. It's like
[10261.06s -> 10272.10s]  a grenade. All right. I gotta bring... Let's see. What time is it? 1 30. I have to 6 to do... I can
[10272.10s -> 10279.30s]  only do... What do I have here? Image in the monitor. We're gonna go back. I'm gonna take
[10279.30s -> 10291.14s]  him back. It's time to save. Save. Yeah. Save the game. Anywhere I can do this. Where's the nearest
[10291.14s -> 10300.62s]  save point? I have to go down and then behind. It's downstairs and then around. Oh, let's faster.
[10300.62s -> 10310.92s]  This way or that way? Probably this way. Learning Jap. Wait. There's a gun. Wait.
[10310.92s -> 10322.07s]  Wait. I probably need to talk to him again. The one thing that's actually kind of hard for me
[10322.07s -> 10327.83s]  to get used to is how left trigger is not aim gun. Left trigger is aim camera. Right trigger is aim
[10327.83s -> 10348.30s]  gun. What the fuck did I just do? Good. All right. Are you guys still... Seriously?
[10351.75s -> 10360.86s]  Coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. Y'all just stare at him. Let's go.
[10361.10s -> 10376.49s]  Come on. Give him a gun. Come on. You can make it. I know you can. Weapons. We can't use like shoes
[10376.49s -> 10382.12s]  for weapons. How many shoe stores does this mall have? Like half of the stores are shoe stores.
[10382.68s -> 10422.33s]  Come here. No? Nothing? Here. You take the gun. You do it. He's got a knife. Give me the knife.
[10422.33s -> 10446.14s]  Let's go. Player in a path. Here. You take this knife. Whatever. Just take... You guys. Anybody
[10446.14s -> 10457.53s]  take a knife. Let's go. All right. Where's that save point? 200 zombies killed. PP bonus. Nice.
[10458.89s -> 10474.79s]  He just shot me in the head. Thanks. Okay. Let's see. Where am I going here? Food court. And then
[10474.79s -> 10484.68s]  there's the save point. And then I have to get back over here. So I can't... Okay. Roller coaster.
[10484.68s -> 10491.29s]  Roller coaster. I gotta save these two. They'll still be on the ride. Don't worry. Look at my
[10491.29s -> 10500.47s]  watch. Out of control. There's still plenty of time. Where the roller coaster is a shortcut.
[10500.47s -> 10510.54s]  Well, I'm already almost there. Like I'm going to the save point over here. Crazy. This way,
[10510.54s -> 10526.94s]  right? Yes. This way to the right and the save point's right there. Here, right? You'll get
[10526.94s -> 10530.62s]  grabbed really easily by these people. Just cover yourself in fucking butter. You'll be fine.
[10531.58s -> 10541.08s]  Are they all right? I give you a gun and a knife and you guys can't even handle yourselves?
[10541.72s -> 10570.10s]  Let's go. Now, where are we at? To the right. Not this way. This way. I just want to save it.
[10578.04s -> 10593.86s]  Come on. Thank you. Shoot me again. I have no health. This is horrible. I need to go. I need
[10593.86s -> 10616.31s]  to go to a restaurant or something. The gym is right here. All right. Cool. I'm going to get
[10616.31s -> 10623.67s]  this. You know what? Fuck it. I think I know what this does. Let's do it. That is what it does. I
[10623.67s -> 10639.85s]  knew it. Now I have to. I'm dead. I'm dead. I gotta go back. I went the wrong way. I'm dead.
[10639.85s -> 10682.76s]  Goodbye. Wasted the bees. I don't care. You guys not make it through. You guys are fucking useless.
[10682.76s -> 10703.88s]  You gotta let everybody die. Who cares? Is this even the right one? They just stand there and let
[10703.88s -> 10713.93s]  the zombies hit them. Look at all this extra work I have to do. I have like a case to solve.
[10716.25s -> 10729.38s]  They're not going to get out of this. You know, the amount of times that you've cupped your hand
[10729.38s -> 10748.92s]  to say, help me. You could have shot the gun five times. You guys have weapons. Use them.
[10751.46s -> 10773.02s]  Let's go. Go, go, go, go. Over here. Are you close enough? Holy sheep shit. I'm dead.
[10775.16s -> 10786.95s]  Why? What happened to my watch? Why is nothing selected? I have to clear a path for them to
[10786.95s -> 10803.90s]  walk in a straight line. Oh, fuck the both of you. Come on. Here. I want you to have a drink.
[10804.86s -> 10810.38s]  I'm certain I would do better in a zombie apocalypse than everybody in this game.
[10811.42s -> 10824.82s]  Like one thousand percent. A million percent positive. Who cares? I don't even want you to
[10824.82s -> 10849.58s]  have a weapon. Okay, let's go. You definitely wouldn't. You have no geography physics intuition
[10849.58s -> 10855.82s]  whatsoever. Are you actually saying that in a video game when I'm walking around a mall
[10855.82s -> 10859.82s]  that I don't know how to like drive my car around the city that I live in?
[10859.82s -> 10878.10s]  What? Wait, where the fuck are we going right now? What is going on? Oh, it's out this way.
[10878.10s -> 10886.92s]  All right. I've got stuff like fucking fighting chat. I'm dead. Yeah, guys, during the zombie
[10886.92s -> 10892.04s]  apocalypse, I'm just going to get up and sprint as fast as I can and ram my body into the wall
[10892.04s -> 10896.60s]  and knock myself unconscious and die. That's what's going to happen. We'll let that be the
[10896.60s -> 10913.24s]  cannon. I'm so sick of babysitting these two. I'm multi-boxing on three accounts right now.
[10920.66s -> 10940.84s]  My fucking god. What are you letting him do this for? Jesus Christ. Just run and call them.
[10940.84s -> 10967.91s]  That's what I was doing. No, not you. The guy. We're dead. We're fucking dead. Are you serious?
[10967.91s -> 10975.78s]  I have to go through the. Oh, we're dead. We're dead. There's no way. Just run. Go. Go. Stop
[10975.78s -> 10982.73s]  running into walls. You fucking. Holy shit. There's no way I'm going to make this back.
[10983.61s -> 10987.85s]  There's no way. Not a chance at hell. They're both dead. What a waste of time this was.
[10991.90s -> 11002.26s]  God, Jesus Christ. You gotta be kidding me. I need a shortcut. How do I log a short.
[11017.32s -> 11035.06s]  Oh, my God. How the hell am I going to do this with these two? Do the roller coaster shortcut?
[11038.54s -> 11071.62s]  God. So you're saying go back to the. I don't think this is humanly possible to get these guys
[11071.62s -> 11076.95s]  across with what I have right now. Go to the gun store and get a gun. So I have to leave these
[11076.95s -> 11087.90s]  guys to die because they just stand around and die. Use the V. Everyone got mad at me when I
[11087.90s -> 11104.73s]  used it last time. I'm going to use it. Well, he's dead. He's killing me so I can redo this.
[11106.74s -> 11128.57s]  Oh, my God. It's such a mess. Help. Help me. Hey, you're still alive over there.
[11128.57s -> 11131.53s]  Crossing the gym is Home Depot. All right, I'm going to go to Home Depot.
[11137.59s -> 11150.33s]  Come this way. Get in here. Both of you. Go here. Take one of these. I can't get this to you.
[11150.33s -> 11159.32s]  It's already broken. All right, that's why this way. This way. This way. This way. This way. This
[11159.32s -> 11168.09s]  way. This way. My God, we're fucked. OK, I need to have weapons here. I've got skill up for this.
[11175.99s -> 11191.61s]  I dropped it. Everything I have is fucking broken. OK, I need to fill up on shit. What
[11191.61s -> 11200.39s]  do we have here? Toolbox, propane, two by four. I really, really need health.
[11204.98s -> 11216.44s]  God knows what the hell that is. All right. At least it's not a total shit show right now.
[11217.40s -> 11231.93s]  All right, what else do we got? Anywhere else? All right, we need to go.
[11232.73s -> 11240.98s]  Let me look at the map. So there's a save point here. Everyone keeps telling me to go to the guy
[11240.98s -> 11247.37s]  that's running. Go to the instant message logo. Aim logo. OK, I'll do it.
[11248.58s -> 11251.38s]  It's like every time I look over here, everyone's yelling at me to do this.
[11252.02s -> 11260.15s]  All right, here. You take this. How many are there anymore? Two by fours.
[11263.69s -> 11273.34s]  Yeah, like lead pipe. Good lead pipe. Plenty of weapons here. You don't even knife. Here,
[11273.34s -> 11290.12s]  take the lead pipe. It's much better. What else is in here? No, I don't want that. Sledgehammer.
[11290.92s -> 11303.32s]  There's a sledgehammer. Brake. Shovel. There's nothing. Oh, here it is. OK. OK, you ready?
[11310.41s -> 11334.14s]  Let's go to the instant message logo. Bang a left and then bang a right. I need health to die.
[11335.98s -> 11345.82s]  Fuck. God damn it. But the gun keeps shooting me. He shot me like five times.
[11362.25s -> 11386.71s]  There are so many motherfuckers down here. There's so many people here. What? Don't even give me this
[11387.35s -> 11418.01s]  bullshit trouble. OK, I have to go heal. Oh, boy, I'm in trouble. I don't remember this game being
[11418.01s -> 11429.90s]  this difficult. Oh, please. Did they increase the amount of enemies on the screen in like the PC
[11429.90s -> 11441.67s]  version? Maybe it's because I was throwing CDs at people. Well, they're just dead. There is no
[11441.67s -> 11459.96s]  physical way I can save those people. Impossible. No way I could do that right there. Holy shit.
[11463.38s -> 11471.21s]  Oh, I'm dead. So what have we learned? We've learned that this was a mistake to come this way,
[11471.21s -> 11475.93s]  and I'm going to go the other way and go to the roller coaster. That's my only option at the
[11475.93s -> 11494.07s]  moment. I don't even care if these guys die. I'm going to go get a weapon. Good luck. Good luck,
[11494.07s -> 11504.12s]  you two. I think I'm wasting too much time trying to take care of every single person I come across
[11504.20s -> 11522.49s]  when no fucking way. They just die. Who cares? Good luck. I wish you the best.
[11523.37s -> 11532.50s]  I kind of want the gun back though. Give me the gun. Here, you can have this.
[11534.36s -> 11568.66s]  No, where's the gun? Give me the gun. Give me the gun. I'm going to get healed. Holy shit.
[11572.31s -> 11581.93s]  I'm not going to shoot this guy. I'm going to. I could have healed the other guy too. Is he dead?
[11589.85s -> 11594.49s]  Well, the other guy was just standing and letting the zombies fucking punch him in the face.
[11594.49s -> 11601.48s]  That's been what the survivors do this whole game. This please hurt me.
[11603.72s -> 11660.98s]  Take him more. Let's go. You can do it. Wait. Good. Did he not make it? You gotta be fucking
[11660.98s -> 11693.10s]  kidding me. I don't care. I'm not going to need that book anymore. Okay, here we go. Hey,
[11693.10s -> 11730.30s]  I'm at the roller coaster. What's here? Rover? This is a shortcut on the roller coaster. I just
[11730.30s -> 11734.30s]  want to make sure we understand. That's what everyone told me to do. I'm never listening to
[11734.30s -> 11763.93s]  the chat ever again. Do I have to fight this guy? I don't. Jesus.
[11785.74s -> 11790.55s]  I have to kill this guy. Whoa. I'm going to get. Okay, run him over. Run him over with the car.
[11790.55s -> 11793.59s]  Run him over with the car. Got him. Already figured it out. I already know what to do. I win.
[11794.55s -> 11824.98s]  What? I did it. Technically. Oh, shit. I'm all the way back here. Not good. Not good.
[11825.94s -> 11831.40s]  This is not good. Oh, boy. This is going to be fun.
[11835.30s -> 11841.86s]  With me, with me, with me. Both, both, both, both, both, both, both, both, both, both, both, both,
[11841.86s -> 11853.24s]  both, both. Fuck the hardware store. Don't read the book. Nice shot. All right. I can keep you
[11853.32s -> 11866.47s]  guys both around. Will they help me during this? Okay. Both of you. Come on. We got some drinking
[11866.47s -> 11880.55s]  to do. Heals. Come here. Take this. Give me the gun. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't worry.
[11880.55s -> 11895.93s]  I'll take care of it. You idiot. Here. Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink. You can do it.
[11896.57s -> 11904.22s]  Here you are. All you have to do is walk up the stairs. It's really easy. Just walk up the stairs.
[11905.02s -> 11916.38s]  You guys are just bait. Just drink the wine. Okay. Give me the knife. I need,
[11917.50s -> 11949.43s]  um, I need to bring a hit. No, you die in one hit anyways from the clown. Here we go. Let's go.
[11949.43s -> 11967.54s]  Nothing in the way. All right. Stay with me. This time. Don't get lost. Go on. Good. Go on. Good.
[11967.54s -> 11972.34s]  Okay. Here we go. I need to get prepared for this though. Is there anything else down here?
[11972.34s -> 11974.02s]  There's probably something I can take. Like a bigger, better,
[11975.86s -> 11999.50s]  gotta be like a better weapon down here. This is, this died my hair. Okay. I'm looking for
[11999.50s -> 12007.30s]  something strong. It's a prop. It's not, is that two? No, it's not tuber here.
[12008.02s -> 12024.15s]  Just cause you said that I have to change it back. Something else. All right. So how am I
[12024.15s -> 12033.14s]  going to kill this guy? Save the game. Is there a safe spot down here? There is. Okay. Down all the
[12033.14s -> 12053.90s]  way down here. We're going to save it. Trade that knife out. So good. Let's get the game saved.
[12066.23s -> 12087.06s]  Good. Finally, you guys have a shred of intelligence. This can't open the maintenance
[12087.06s -> 12096.54s]  key to open these. Fuck. Okay. Let's keep going and save the game. I'm in a much better position
[12096.54s -> 12119.86s]  with this health though. Just take it slow. No reason to go fast. You're going to die in two hits.
[12119.94s -> 12122.42s]  Yeah, I know. At least I'm going to die in two hits and not one.
[12126.82s -> 12146.60s]  What? Oh, good. Swimming through this guy. So now the game is saved. Is it worth it? Should I?
[12146.60s -> 12158.57s]  Okay. I'm going up there. You can be the one that shoots. I'm just going to trail them around. Okay.
[12158.57s -> 12184.50s]  Here we go. Throw some jewels at them. I think that's a great idea. Good. All right. Handgun.
[12184.50s -> 12199.88s]  Handgun. Handgun. Handgun. Okay. Cool. All right. All right. All right. Here we go. Wait.
[12199.88s -> 12205.45s]  Everybody take a handgun. Take one. We're going to do this together. Look, if we light him up,
[12205.45s -> 12213.69s]  he can't do anything. If we fire three guns at him at the same time, he's dead. Don't aim at me.
[12215.34s -> 12226.62s]  Okay. You ready? Three guns. I don't care if you miss. You're at least a distraction.
[12228.22s -> 12241.42s]  So where am I? I just have to run back here. I'm going to light them up. Good. This way.
[12244.94s -> 12251.77s]  I want you guys right here. In here with me. So you can make sure. Here we go. Let's do it.
[12251.77s -> 12273.54s]  Here we go. Shoot him. He's blocking. He's blocking everything. Wait. Is he coming?
[12276.34s -> 12290.74s]  Shoot him. You can't shoot him. What's that? Oh, whoa. Whoa. What is that? What's that? What is
[12290.74s -> 12304.79s]  that? Oh, I stunned him. What happened? Did you shoot the balloon? Follow me. Follow me. Follow
[12304.79s -> 12317.86s]  me. Follow me. Follow me. Shoot the balloon. Oh, no. Shinji. Shoot the balloon. Shinji,
[12317.86s -> 12337.74s]  don't you have a gun? Shinji, shoot something. Oh, sorry. Light him up. Give me your gun.
[12339.90s -> 12345.94s]  Oh, balloon. Follow, follow. Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
[12346.74s -> 12362.07s]  Balloon. Shoot him. Run. This way. No. Get out of the way. Kill him. Quick.
[12364.63s -> 12384.74s]  Somebody hit him. He was going in with the dumbbell for the last hit. I freaked out. At
[12384.74s -> 12396.52s]  least I got him. That was horrible. Hardest boss in the game. Psychopath defeated. Guys,
[12397.56s -> 12411.46s]  no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't run away. Small chainsaw. You obtained the ID card. Okay.
[12413.13s -> 12437.72s]  Excellent work. You two were worth saving and let's go home. Get on the ride. No, who's this?
[12439.40s -> 12456.78s]  He just looks over and goes. Greg, any other survivors around? Yes, there are. The three of
[12456.78s -> 12463.67s]  us. I'm sure everyone's in the security room. It's safe there. We got to go. Security room? I know
[12463.67s -> 12471.80s]  a shortcut there. Where is it then? Greg, I'd love for you to show us. Small, how many small
[12471.80s -> 12498.01s]  chainsaws can I have? This way. Come on. Which way? I was ahead of you. Holy shit, this weapon is
[12498.01s -> 12521.77s]  incredible. Wait, I couldn't do a PP there. This is so much better. Imagine playing the game with
[12521.77s -> 12547.99s]  anything but this. Wait, there's some sass there. Hold on. Come on. Will this instantly kill Greg?
[12549.82s -> 12555.18s]  I'm so scared to accidentally kill somebody. I will instantly kill somebody if I hit them.
[12556.28s -> 12569.21s]  Don't walk into me, please. This way. I got four of you. Shinji, let's go. This thing's gonna break.
[12572.01s -> 12593.62s]  It's gonna break. Do we have another one? Yeah, but should I save it? You guys good? Shinji. Uh-oh.
[12594.58s -> 12626.09s]  Shinji. Shinji. Let's go. They respawned. Oh, fuck. All right. Get. Come on, you guys. Made it.
[12627.72s -> 12632.41s]  Everybody? Do I have everybody? Just head through here and we're already at Paradise Plaza. Nice
[12632.41s -> 12657.29s]  shortcut, huh? What do you mean head through here? Oh, oh shit. Okay. Bathroom. Okay. Let's
[12657.85s -> 12672.06s]  go. How we doing? Image in the monitor. We're almost there, right? Now we down here. Bang it
[12672.06s -> 12697.37s]  left. Let's go. You guys aren't all stuck in the hallway, are you? One at a time. Okay, it's fine.
[12698.01s -> 12718.18s]  I got him with the end. No, somebody's caught. Who is it? Shinji again. Shinji. You're killing me,
[12718.18s -> 12732.25s]  Shinji. You're killing me with this bullshit. It's always you. It's always you. Always. Be better.
[12732.97s -> 12754.10s]  Okay, now is it up or is it to the... I think it's straight ahead, right? Yeah, it's just this way.
[12754.10s -> 12768.49s]  Stop running away from your problems. Okay. Just follow the arrow. Yeah, I know, but sometimes it
[12768.49s -> 12797.93s]  can be upstairs. Oh my... Stop standing still. Get over here. You idiots. Oh, you're gonna get me
[12797.93s -> 12820.15s]  killed. Let's go. Oh shit. Somebody get that. Go get it. I'm not doing this. I'm dead. They need to...
[12820.15s -> 12835.54s]  They have to do... They have to take care of it. You guys are useless. Absolutely useless. Don't
[12835.54s -> 12842.33s]  shoot me with the gun. In fact, give me the gun. Here, you take the knife. You take the dumbbell.
[12842.89s -> 12875.90s]  Give me the gun. All right, I feel much safer now. Go in there. Come on. God, I just... I would move,
[12875.90s -> 12895.21s]  but I just don't have any health. Come on. No. We good? I need all of you. What happened to Greg?
[12895.21s -> 12915.34s]  Oh, he's not as... Okay. Somebody... Somebody get this guy. Get in there. Get in there. Get in
[12915.34s -> 12917.90s]  there. Get in there. Get in there. Get in there. Get in there. Get in there. Get in there. Get in
[12917.90s -> 12942.68s]  there. Get in there. Just press the button. Oh my god. That was horrible. Get up here. Nice jump. I
[12942.68s -> 12950.39s]  got three survivors. I feel good about this. I did it. I'm honored that you helped me. Please accept
[12950.39s -> 12967.37s]  my humble gratitude. Got them both. Escort complete. 90,000 pp. Hell yeah. Save. That's what I'm going
[12967.45s -> 12982.66s]  for right now. Let's do it. Save game. That was... My whole body just hurt when that elevator opened.
[12986.23s -> 12993.98s]  No more puny inventory. Oh, thank god. Okay. Start next mission. Image in the monitor.
[12994.94s -> 13001.27s]  The zombies berserk like they tell the professor going anywhere until morning.
[13002.87s -> 13018.86s]  Not this one. Might need to spend the night here. Yeah. No, no. Okay. What? Did I just do that
[13019.34s -> 13021.18s]  with like 30 seconds remaining?
[13026.01s -> 13029.64s]  Holy shit. Okay.
[13051.37s -> 13054.01s]  Brad, it's just a screen. That's not really here.
[13058.44s -> 13073.53s]  Case two. Yeah. Let's save it. All right. Rescue the professor. Okay. I gotta do this now.
[13075.18s -> 13080.73s]  Look at this inventory. I feel so great. Oh my goodness. Look at that. It's so much better.
[13082.10s -> 13103.34s]  All right. I gotta do this now. We gotta go. I can't even get rid of the book.
[13103.90s -> 13109.99s]  I don't need this, right? Yeah. I can't even throw a book over a fucking fence.
[13118.23s -> 13125.02s]  Okay. So let's do this. Rescue the professor. Shadow of the north of the plaza.
[13125.82s -> 13133.91s]  Yeah. I bet that shit would happen to me when I first came in here.
[13135.59s -> 13141.22s]  It's too late for that. Yeah, there's no one doing that. Oh, there's Otis calling.
[13150.20s -> 13165.94s]  Sorry, Otis. I'm running around. All right. So I've got photo challenge, wherever that is,
[13165.94s -> 13171.78s]  and then now the professor one has to happen now. All right. Fine. Frank, looks like the
[13171.78s -> 13176.34s]  shutter leading to the entrance plaza is open now. Maybe the guy dragging the old man around
[13176.34s -> 13180.26s]  opened it. Anyway, you can get to the entrance plaza through paradise plaza now. Well, that's
[13180.26s -> 13215.14s]  great. Look at that. Uh-oh. Don't be daydreaming out here. Sniper? You're gonna turn into a pair
[13215.14s -> 13236.79s]  of pants or you're actually gonna help me this time? Frank, that's not a sniper rifle. Ah, shit.
[13236.79s -> 13253.35s]  That's right. Hey, it's the professor. Look out! The professor's gonna end up zombie challenge.
[13253.35s -> 13261.46s]  Oh, great. This is gonna be wonderful. I'm going for it. You just worry about staying alive. Got it?
[13261.46s -> 13281.43s]  Good. That got chunks on my face. That's disgusting. Action shot. Okay. Stay alive.
[13282.50s -> 13295.06s]  I think I can do that. Bag of chips. Uh, okay. I'm just gonna go this way. I'm coming to save you,
[13295.06s -> 13311.11s]  Barnaby! Look, I'm blocking his vision. Good strategy. All right, Barnaby. I'm here.
[13311.67s -> 13339.74s]  That didn't work. Here! Catch! Actually, I need those. I need those. Can I shoot them?
[13345.43s -> 13366.52s]  Sorry. Can I shoot the rope? That was really, really, really bad. Can you get off? Thanks for
[13366.52s -> 13393.43s]  the help, dude. Appreciate it. Nice work. Well, I'm dead. Um, it looks like I'm going up. Do I run
[13393.43s -> 13406.79s]  faster like this? Imagine turning around as Brad and seeing this. You would have no time to even
[13406.79s -> 13412.07s]  react to this. You'd be like, what? What are you doing? No, stop it, man. What's wrong?
[13413.03s -> 13424.44s]  Holy shit, Brad. Why is he holding, like, a .50 caliber sniper rifle like this? Oh my god.
[13424.44s -> 13459.40s]  That's awful. Brad, just, Brad, just hit some coffee creamer. Brad! So, I need to just go up
[13459.40s -> 13474.84s]  there and kill, I guess. I guess. I don't know. You guys both suck. I ran over to the professor,
[13474.84s -> 13504.79s]  and I thought I had to, like, cut him loose. I might need it later, I don't care. Don't get
[13504.79s -> 13523.77s]  the chainsaws. Oh, lead pipe. Nice. I can't take that call right now. So, where was that shortcut?
[13523.77s -> 13529.45s]  The chainsaws respawn. That's kind of insane. So, is this the shortcut that takes me down
[13530.01s -> 13542.46s]  to here? Where's the red one? Can I now open these? All right, so I'll go there. Like,
[13542.46s -> 13558.73s]  can I do all those now, or do I have to have specific, like, keys to open them? So glad I
[13558.73s -> 13573.75s]  have more space. All right, so then now I go straight this way. This game's fun. All right,
[13573.75s -> 13586.76s]  go ahead and tell me what you want to tell me. All right, listen. Okay. Give me the gun. Oh,
[13586.76s -> 13606.73s]  no gun. Just a night stick. Well, shit. Grab the chainsaw. How am I going to use the chainsaw
[13606.73s -> 13630.26s]  against the guy with the sniper rifle? Don't. I think it's just to the right. It is. It's an
[13630.26s -> 13638.47s]  early 360 game. Of course it's janky. That's all right, though. The game came out, like,
[13638.47s -> 13654.73s]  12, what, 10, 12 years ago? More than that. Like, 14 years ago? Okay. Wonderland. Let's grab the
[13654.73s -> 13668.49s]  chainsaw. He's back this way, right? What was that roller coaster? That's the roller coaster, right?
[13675.19s -> 13708.86s]  Oh, did you guys just bounce off that guy's head? Are there two up here or just one? Oh, actually,
[13708.86s -> 13724.12s]  I'm one of the guys. I wasn't even trying to do that, and he's gonna kill me. A lot of motherfuckers
[13724.12s -> 13745.69s]  over here. Ah, for the love of God. I'm gonna have to use the chainsaw to even get out of here.
[13746.41s -> 13757.16s]  Bingo. All right, now let's go. I can cut through here, can't I? How much fall damage is there in
[13757.16s -> 13769.93s]  the game? A lot? How much is there? Barely any. Okay, now I want some more food.
[13771.59s -> 13788.82s]  That's such bullshit. I need food. I'm going through the food court. Ah, no, this thing sucks. I don't
[13788.82s -> 13805.56s]  want it. Let's get rid of this. All right, chainsaw and knife, and then I want a bunch of food. Okay.
[13805.56s -> 13809.48s]  There's about a two people holed up in one of the shoe stores in Wonderland Plaza. I can't do that
[13809.48s -> 13816.58s]  right now. I'm sorry. Must be a couple looks like something's wrong. Oh, that's not a whole lot of
[13816.58s -> 13827.03s]  time. Let's get three full heels. In fact, just eat this and get a bunch more. Okay, cool. All right,
[13827.03s -> 13838.84s]  I have four full heels, a knife, a gun, and a chainsaw. I'm ready. I got some scoop. Make some
[13838.84s -> 13855.67s]  quick step. Not a bad idea. Why do I keep getting the same ad for Nerf Ultra every single ad?
[13855.83s -> 13865.88s]  They still make Nerf guns? All right, we're gonna do yogurt and popsicle. We'll make like two of them.
[13867.08s -> 13879.98s]  Nerf or nothing? They still been using that same slogan too. Let's do ice pops again and yogurt.
[13882.34s -> 13887.48s]  What about milk? Milk and yogurt? That's like... All right, I'm running out of space here. Okay, I need...
[13889.61s -> 13913.51s]  Okay, I need... Come on. Come on. Just make it so it's not... Recommended. Nectar.
[13914.74s -> 13920.68s]  So sweet and irresistible. Even these can't resist this brew. What is it? Recommended beverage.
[13920.68s -> 13932.31s]  Nectar. All right, whatever the hell that means. I got two quick steps. Let's do wine and milk. Oh,
[13932.31s -> 13946.54s]  that would be disgusting. What is it? Quick step. Try does it only get quick steps and just use all
[13946.54s -> 13965.48s]  my wine. This is a full heel, isn't it? Pink Russian. Quick steps not gonna get you drunk.
[13970.60s -> 13987.91s]  Okay, don't accidentally drink these. All I have is a gun. Let's go. So now I take the shortcut back.
[13989.53s -> 14013.90s]  Wait, I need to save some of these. So bang, I can go up here, right?
[14014.62s -> 14037.16s]  Or should I save it? Save it and then go this way. That's what I'm doing. Yeah, so we've got to save.
[14037.16s -> 14045.43s]  We've got a place to go back up. Oh, I pressed it. I did. I was just holding the gun to my head.
[14057.74s -> 14068.73s]  I am now ready for the boss. Let's go. Go through the exit door, which is over here.
[14069.45s -> 14103.37s]  All right. Check it. Yes, it is. I don't have that. I hear people screaming. Who is screaming
[14103.37s -> 14127.18s]  right now? Here's the entrance plaza. What? This is holy shit. That's for real. I thought you guys
[14127.18s -> 14195.11s]  were fucking with me. There we go. Okay. One, two, fast and oozy. Hacker. Hacker. I just got like
[14195.11s -> 14231.03s]  pre-fired. Fucking shoot me. Just chugging protein shakes. Are you kidding me? I should
[14231.03s -> 14257.22s]  have a chainsaw in my hand. Pick up the sniper. He's unconscious, but alive. Damn. Is he all right?
[14257.22s -> 14272.94s]  Yeah, I'm not in any condition to carry him. You're gonna have to carry me and him. Just go.
[14273.66s -> 14295.29s]  Go to the bike store. I'll get on the pegs. That's not a good way to carry somebody. You
[14295.29s -> 14300.39s]  would pull his arms out of his socket. The sedatives take an effect. Carrying him by
[14300.39s -> 14318.60s]  both of his shoulders. I managed to stop the bleeding, but he's running a fever. He needs
[14318.60s -> 14339.74s]  medicine. A fever. Medicine, huh? Yeah, that's what I said. Case two. Case two, three. Met it. Oh god.
[14339.74s -> 14344.38s]  My mom's out of time. Holy shit. That's no time. No time. No time. No time. No time. I have to go
[14344.38s -> 14349.50s]  now. I need to save it. I'm gonna be all hopped up on protein drinks. Save it and go.
[14357.43s -> 14366.55s]  I would not hold your hand on the trigger and lie down on your chainsaw as a pillow. All right,
[14367.35s -> 14382.09s]  run. I have to hurry up. I'm not gonna drink this yet. Not until I get out there. Medicine, run.
[14385.37s -> 14427.99s]  You fucker. Get out of my way. How many heals? Drink it. No, it slows me down. No, it doesn't.
[14435.27s -> 14460.87s]  Get off the phone. God. Am I out of juice? All right, I think I'm all right. I have to go this way.
[14461.43s -> 14493.21s]  Do I really? I hate these guys. Time until helicopter arrives. Where am I going?
[14495.99s -> 14512.60s]  Frank, we made it to the north plaza. All right, I'm out. Tell me what you want.
[14512.60s -> 14523.26s]  Don't hang up on me. There's a supermarket there along with a gun shop, a cutlery shop, and a home
[14523.26s -> 14563.90s]  center. Every time Otis calls, take a shot. I would not suggest doing that. I need another weapon.
[14567.34s -> 14598.47s]  Fuck. All right, food store. I can heal, right? Just you're in the supermarket. I know.
[14600.01s -> 14603.61s]  You can get to the pharmacy through the door between the butcher counter and the seafood
[14603.69s -> 14618.97s]  counter. I couldn't know. Oh, this is fairly healthy. There's somebody inside the home and
[14618.97s -> 14622.81s]  garden shop in alfresco plaza. I didn't get to look at him, but I'm pretty sure it was a man.
[14622.81s -> 14637.94s]  Okay, he looks scared. Lettuce. Grapefruit. No, I need like apples. I think that heals the most.
[14640.20s -> 14647.86s]  I can make this into a smoothie, couldn't I? Okay, is there a save point?
[14650.71s -> 14654.15s]  There is outside back here. Okay, I'm gonna do that first because I have no idea what's
[14654.15s -> 14667.53s]  going on in here. Lettuce and cooking oil for a smoothie. I mean, what time is it?
[14668.33s -> 14704.41s]  2 15. What time is his end? 2 16. What are you talking about? Are you serious? Did I make it?
[14742.66s -> 14748.90s]  Okay, a person riding in grocery cart. Somebody pushing. We're gonna have to do like bumper cars.
[14779.18s -> 14781.10s]  Scream so loud he disconnected my ex-wife.
[14794.74s -> 14804.57s]  Bitch said when she came to vandalize my store, I don't take kindly to vandalism.
[14804.57s -> 14808.78s]  All right, so just throw a bunch of shit all over the place. Break everything in the store,
[14808.78s -> 14813.02s]  throw everything on the ground, and he'll get stunned. Do I got it right?
[14815.66s -> 14825.16s]  He looked like a puppet. Like somebody had the hand up his back.
[14827.90s -> 14857.40s]  Oh, he has a gun too. He has a gun too. All right, that doesn't work. It might. Holy shit,
[14857.40s -> 14886.71s]  that was. Don't vandalize, right? He hates this. He's in the corner. How do I get him out of the
[14886.71s -> 14906.84s]  corner? Shit. Sneak. Sneak. Snack. Is he going this way? All right, jump across and chainsaw.
[14906.84s -> 14914.47s]  Ready, three, two, one, go. Did I do good or did I do bad? I can't tell.
[14950.46s -> 14951.90s]  This guy's freaking me out.
[14964.18s -> 14965.46s]  Don't shoot yourself in the head.
[14985.66s -> 15001.62s]  I have to get a different clothes. I have the same shitty outfit on. Is my hair a different color?
[15002.42s -> 15020.33s]  One tough cookie. Can you stand? Look, I saw you at the entrance yesterday. You needed medicine too.
[15020.33s -> 15026.41s]  Maybe we should work together. I don't need any help. He's got a pretty sick bugleberry jacket
[15026.41s -> 15033.13s]  though, I would say. You're the one who caused this nightmare. You ruined Santa Cabeza and started
[15033.13s -> 15059.56s]  all this. Oh, a key. Wait, I still have to. I have to hurry up now. Medicine run.
[15061.08s -> 15069.19s]  How do I get in? A key? Use the key. Use the key? How do I get in this? How do I get inside? How do I
[15069.19s -> 15088.42s]  get in the medicine store? How do I get in there? How do I get in there? Come on. Use the pharmacy
[15088.42s -> 15104.49s]  key. First aid kit. I have to bring this back all the way in how much time? What do I need? Where's
[15104.49s -> 15118.31s]  it going? I don't know. Should I go up the stairs? Use the cart. Okay, grab the cart and where am I
[15118.31s -> 15130.42s]  going? Just follow the cart. Okay, I have no time for this shit. I have to go cart and just run.
[15131.30s -> 15140.22s]  You think I can make it? Okay. I didn't mean to do that. I was trying. No, I want to
[15141.02s -> 15154.09s]  I need to put this down. I can't leave with the cart. How do I leave with the cart?
[15162.70s -> 15204.89s]  What? No, don't go over jumps. You idiot. It's not worth spending the time. Hurry, hurry, hurry.
[15204.89s -> 15227.48s]  Go. No, no jump. What? What? Do I have to pick this up? Pick it up. Pick the cart up. Wait,
[15227.48s -> 15247.13s]  did I miss this? Did I miss a shortcut? No. I was trying so hard to just get behind it.
[15247.85s -> 15258.07s]  It's over. I'm not going to be able to do it. I pick it up. Stand behind it. Pick it up.
[15259.94s -> 15267.10s]  Fuck. I'm so angry right now. I'm going to take the car. I'm going to kill him and take the car.
[15267.74s -> 15289.27s]  I can't believe it. That's what happens when you have the same button mapped to everything.
[15292.04s -> 15310.38s]  They've learned since then. Get the fuck away from me. Okay. Where is it?
[15312.94s -> 15328.47s]  Bang A left. No, just go straight. Is there anything else I can go faster with? I had that
[15329.34s -> 15332.70s]  stupid shopping cart. I lost this shopping cart and that was a huge problem.
[15401.72s -> 15418.55s]  Okay. The next case will occur at 11 a.m. All right. The professor's passed, but that's
[15418.55s -> 15439.06s]  why is that so blocked out? Save it. Yep. Not that way. Not that way. Crap. Where am I going?
[15439.78s -> 15445.05s]  I'm coming down. You know when you're coming down after being really stressed out playing
[15445.05s -> 15460.98s]  something and then your brain sort of starts to try to unwind. All right. So I'm good. Free
[15460.98s -> 15470.71s]  roam time. I appreciate that. Thank you. Why don't you guys pose? I understand. Perfect.
[15471.59s -> 15482.14s]  No, I'm not. I'm not drugs. I'm talking about just when you don't matter. All right. Now look up.
[15483.53s -> 15510.92s]  Give me sad. Okay. What? No, turn back around. All right. I want a really good cinematic shot.
[15511.72s -> 15543.38s]  All right. Stop wasting photos. What happened? Free roam. Not enough time. He stabilized.
[15544.02s -> 15550.92s]  I had enough time to go to the bathroom. Are you all right? You have blood on you.
[15551.88s -> 15564.79s]  Huh? Yeah. Must be from that girl I saved. Girl? Was she hurt? I offered to help her, but
[15564.79s -> 15569.94s]  she took off. Must be from that bus full of children that I saved, you know.
[15572.98s -> 15579.53s]  Anyway, she was saying something about Santa Cabeza. Santa Cabeza? I think I...
[15580.09s -> 15587.10s]  Somebody turning? Dr. Barnaby, you're awake.
[15587.82s -> 15600.58s]  Santa Cabeza. I should have known. I thought Santa Cabeza was over and done with.
[15601.98s -> 15608.54s]  You plan to dispense justice now? Calm down, Dr. Barnaby. We're only following orders.
[15609.18s -> 15616.71s]  We have to protect you. Protect? More like imprison. Professor, if we're going to protect you,
[15616.71s -> 15623.11s]  we need to know the truth. I know who this is. All of it. Please. Who is this? Talk to us.
[15623.99s -> 15643.13s]  I take it you know what Santa Cabeza is. Am I right? All right. I have to get out of this
[15644.01s -> 15649.37s]  WWE 2k20 created character clothing in here. I'll just get my information somewhere else. Thank
[15649.37s -> 15663.67s]  you very much. Maybe if I can track down that woman again. All right. Let me see what I got.
[15664.39s -> 15670.82s]  Case number three coming up from 11 a.m. The next case will occur at 3 p.m. Oh, so I got
[15670.82s -> 15679.50s]  some free roam time. I actually really do. All right. I got some time. Is there anything else
[15679.50s -> 15700.31s]  I can do? The hatchet man and the coward. Coward. Say lovers A and B. I'm not gonna get there fast
[15700.31s -> 15725.40s]  enough. I'm the coward. Well, I'm not gonna get there fast enough. It's not all about doing the
[15725.40s -> 15731.26s]  missions. It's about I need I want to go and get some cool weapons and I want to change my clothes.
[15737.77s -> 15748.02s]  I want to press just press it up so I can throw further now. I think that's the last thing I
[15748.02s -> 15776.39s]  leveled up with. I sure did. Let's test it. Nice. Okay. Okay. Let's get some clothes. This is a
[15776.39s -> 15795.18s]  reading store. It's recharge the battery. I need a new weapon. They don't have anything. Oh wait.
[15796.06s -> 15807.27s]  Toy store. Fine. I'll put on like the joke outfit. Okay. Fine. Frisbee. That's actually pretty fun.
[15808.07s -> 15820.34s]  Check this out. Ready? Oops. Wrong button. Change clothes. All right. I can be the roblox guy.
[15821.06s -> 15839.94s]  What else can I do? Oh super soaker. Nice. Now this I remember this. This is what I remember.
[15842.57s -> 15845.61s]  I remember. Hey dude. I gotta go to the bathroom. Like you want to play for a minute?
[15846.33s -> 15854.06s]  Yeah sure man. And I did this for about 45 seconds. This is kind of fun game. Yeah. Yeah man.
[15854.06s -> 15871.14s]  Ready to go? Yeah. I'm ready to go. I'm not making this. This is not a joke. This is actually
[15871.14s -> 15890.63s]  happening with my time in Dead Rising 1. All right. What about over here? Kids clothing. Can I pick
[15890.63s -> 15904.68s]  the color shirt? No. I want a different outfit. I don't want just like the kids clothes. I was
[15904.76s -> 15913.58s]  already in this. There's no other style. It's only this. I have to be in like the man-child outfit.
[15920.84s -> 15928.33s]  Bowling ball. Nice. It's perfect for you. What about this? Oh wait. Hold on.
[15929.05s -> 15938.92s]  Oh no. I'm gonna Lefford. I'm gonna Lefford that myself. I think this is even worse.
[15938.92s -> 15947.00s]  Yeah. What about this? What's in here? There's two sides. Is it the same thing?
[15947.48s -> 15960.74s]  What the fuck just happened? All right. Can I? Is there a horse body that I can use?
[15961.78s -> 15978.39s]  Is it like a furry outfit? Is it like a furry suit? All right. Let's do the coward. What we got?
[15978.39s -> 15983.59s]  Weekly photo magazine. What does this do? Get a visual cue to indicate prime photo timing. That's
[15983.59s -> 15992.31s]  kind of cool. I'll use it for a while. I lost a scoop. Sports. Hold on to sporting goods three
[15992.31s -> 16002.54s]  times as long as usual. I'll use it for now. Hey Frankie. Did you get your homework done?
[16002.54s -> 16014.10s]  What? What's up? It's you again. I get it. We're all nervous when we're beginners.
[16014.98s -> 16025.02s]  Okay. Let me take a look. Show me your best shot. Uh oh. Am I gonna get judged? Get your
[16025.02s -> 16041.08s]  best erotica photo ready. I don't have any. This is just somebody sitting down. This one?
[16041.80s -> 16062.42s]  Beginner's luck. That's all. What? Did I just complete the mission? Just one more contest Frank.
[16064.10s -> 16074.14s]  Be here tomorrow at noon. We'll settle this. It's like an old medieval helmet. At noon tomorrow.
[16086.04s -> 16091.77s]  Cool. All right. So uh I have some of these. Okay wait. We're gonna go to the smoothie shop.
[16093.18s -> 16098.20s]  Pie. Can I? Is there a blender back here? Can I make a pie smoothie? That'd probably help.
[16099.22s -> 16109.35s]  Pamela. Wait. You'll be fine. Pamela. Pamela do you want a pie smoothie? I'm making two.
[16109.35s -> 16135.77s]  Wait. She's gonna die. No. Don't read. Fuck. I don't have any weapons.
[16136.84s -> 16149.19s]  I'm the worst help you could have asked for Pamela. Fuck. No. You brought the fucking sicko.
[16149.91s -> 16157.10s]  I need an actual weapon. Give me the cash register quick. Who the fuck are you? Heather.
[16157.74s -> 16177.99s]  I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. You're in a weird spot. I mean I'm fashioner headed
[16177.99s -> 16187.32s]  but it's working. All right get up. Come on. Up here. You just please move your body up this way.
[16188.20s -> 16227.61s]  There's no more cash registers. There's no more cash registers. Oh my god. Nice job. I need that
[16227.61s -> 16235.62s]  book. What? Okay. Why can't I not just deselect? Like okay. If I have the book in my hand why can
[16235.62s -> 16239.86s]  I just select it? No unarmed. I want to keep the book but I don't want to have it in my hand to
[16239.86s -> 16266.39s]  read it. Why is it I cannot have unarmed? Follow me. Up on the d-pad. Take one of these.
[16275.14s -> 16285.99s]  Fuck you. I'm trying to help you. Stop that. You can't break...
[16289.61s -> 16299.85s]  I'm the worst guide. Okay so if I go this way I can go up right? No I don't need that. It's
[16299.85s -> 16316.44s]  right there. It's literally right here. This is very bad. This stuff sucks. I need... Okay I'm
[16316.44s -> 16323.85s]  gonna die. I'm not dying for this shit. Track this way. Follow me. Of course you guys are in
[16323.85s -> 16338.87s]  the toy store. Give me that book. Where? What are you doing over there? No. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[16338.87s -> 16352.84s]  Yeah. This way. Okay. All right. All right. Nice work. Now I need to... All right. Jesus.
[16355.58s -> 16390.20s]  Straight up the way that I'm facing. Come here. Can I just... Let's open it again.
[16390.20s -> 16404.47s]  They'll give me an opportunity to try that again. I guess.
[16405.91s -> 16428.57s]  This is the one right? Where's the coward? Okay. All right. So now I'm going to...
[16430.33s -> 16437.67s]  I'm not going to be upset by that. I want some heals though. I don't know if there is any.
[16438.31s -> 16460.60s]  Is there any healing? What? I need a photo? Of what? Go take a... Wait I didn't take it?
[16464.47s -> 16486.98s]  All right. I'm just gonna take the same photo. I don't want to do this. I'm not... I didn't want
[16486.98s -> 16507.94s]  to zoom in on... I didn't... I just... Okay. I'm out. I have to be in this every single time.
[16508.90s -> 16519.18s]  It's just a nuisance to press the button in the elevator. All right. I'm gonna take some weapons.
[16520.95s -> 16526.47s]  So where was... Where's the photo contest? I think I kind of accidentally ran into it.
[16528.70s -> 16543.13s]  Second floor cafe. That's the one. Tell me what you want to tell me. Sandwich shop at Paradise
[16543.13s -> 16549.40s]  Plaza. I look pretty overweight from what I saw on the monitor. Okay. He's not going there to get
[16549.40s -> 16559.94s]  food. He's a restaurant man. We'll do restaurant man after coward. All right. Here we go. Camera
[16559.94s -> 16588.26s]  shop. Well I won't have time. Probably not. Upstairs cafe. Is it B? Oh it's a B. Nice. Cafe.
[16588.26s -> 16598.18s]  Which is over here. Remember we talked about the pie. Where is he? Was he over here or something? He
[16598.18s -> 16615.58s]  like ran into a... Where was this? Remember this is where I got the pie. I think it was another store.
[16616.30s -> 16636.36s]  He'll just come to you. Where are you at? Any clothes I can get in? Skateboard. That's good.
[16636.36s -> 16647.37s]  I'll take it. Golf club. I'll take it. Come back at 12. It's almost 12 right now. I'm gonna make some
[16647.37s -> 16674.47s]  smoothies. All right. So what we got? We have uh cans of drinks and uh pie. What do I get?
[16675.19s -> 16693.03s]  It's one pie. The ketchup or something I can dump in there. I ate the other pies. Why did I eat the
[16693.03s -> 16721.00s]  other pies? All right. Almost noon. I'm ready. Oh apples. I like apples and mangoes and shit.
[16721.72s -> 16743.72s]  All right. This is an apple pie. Different. Untouchable. I hear him. This is different too. What is this?
[16743.72s -> 16767.45s]  Nectar. All right. Hey. Where'd he go? I just heard him. Hey you are Frankie. Uh I just hurt my throat.
[16768.01s -> 16790.12s]  Beginner's luck. Come back tomorrow at noon. Beginner's luck. That's all. Here we go. And now I
[16790.12s -> 16796.26s]  have I have an actual weapon now. I have a skateboard and I have a pipe. Back to the
[16796.26s -> 16805.00s]  smoothie bar. And it's time to help her. Okay. I got I'm gonna make a double pie smoothie. Quickly.
[16805.80s -> 16819.48s]  Quickly. Quickly. Hurry up. Hurry up. Okay. Good. Let's go. I've got that. I've got a bug. I have a bug.
[16820.28s -> 16850.66s]  I'm gonna use it here. Bingo. You're safe. Picture first. Ah it's uh I fucked it up.
[16850.66s -> 16858.92s]  Thank you very much. Pamela Tomkins has joined. Okay. Let's follow me this way. And you.
[16864.62s -> 16877.34s]  Don't just let the thing attack you. I got both of you. All right. What should I give you guys?
[16878.14s -> 16892.78s]  How about um you guys got any boards? New skill. That one. I mean that was like a weird uh they were
[16892.78s -> 16895.98s]  doing like okay that was weird. Okay. New master the power push skill. How do I do that?
[16901.83s -> 16912.54s]  Here. Both of you take one of these. You can't give it to him? All right. Oh very important.
[16913.18s -> 16928.09s]  All right. Let's return. Let's go this way. It is the how do I get out of here? We're looking for
[16928.09s -> 16933.69s]  it's just this way into the left. Very easy. Just be able to get out quickly.
[16937.98s -> 16941.72s]  Don't have to hold both of their hands. I'm running out of time for the coward man.
[16942.36s -> 16968.06s]  What are you doing? Here. Why did you let go? Good. Hold on a minute. I got this.
[16968.94s -> 16993.13s]  Where's my weapon? Don't have a weapon? This way. Oh shit. Go. Go. Go. Go. Knife.
[16994.76s -> 17009.58s]  Seriously. This is bad. Nice push. Nice push. Nice push. Nice nice nice nice nice nice.
[17010.47s -> 17017.08s]  Made it. Stay with me. Stop. Don't cry. Don't cry. Come on.
[17021.30s -> 17035.18s]  Like yelling like their mother. Am I going the right way? I passed it. It's behind us.
[17045.54s -> 17068.50s]  Where are you going? Almost there. All right. We're safe. I might have to do restaurant man
[17068.50s -> 17089.45s]  though. Pamela. I know you can do it. There's no zombies. I'll take care of everything. Just
[17089.45s -> 17140.90s]  follow behind me. Let's go. I'm ready. In. Bingo. Pamela. Heather Tompkins. This place sucks. It's
[17140.90s -> 17151.05s]  dirty. It's cramped. Isn't there a shower around here? 60,000p. That's a lot of p.
[17152.15s -> 17157.61s]  Yeah. Speed up. Good. Speed increased. All right. I need to look at the move list.
[17158.33s -> 17163.22s]  Do I have enough time to do a coward? Okay. What about status?
[17166.98s -> 17173.35s]  Speed. Okay. Skills. Jump kick. I know that is zombie red. This skill allows you to climb on
[17173.35s -> 17177.99s]  unsuspecting zombies. You can even walk along the top of zombie crowds. Press A while pushing
[17177.99s -> 17185.16s]  left stick towards nearby standing zombies. I've done that. Kick back. When grabbed by a zombie,
[17185.16s -> 17190.30s]  repeatedly push left stick in the direction Frank is facing to deliver a kick to the attacker.
[17190.30s -> 17199.40s]  Repeatedly. Does that mean go? What does that mean? Just hold it. Okay. Flying dodge. Push
[17199.40s -> 17203.56s]  left stick in the same direction twice in rapid succession to throw yourself in that direction.
[17203.56s -> 17208.20s]  So it's a dodge. You are invincible at the beginning of this move, but the end will leave
[17208.20s -> 17213.03s]  you open for a moment. Okay. Avoid zombie attacks with this skill. When grabbed by a zombie,
[17213.03s -> 17218.39s]  repeatedly push left stick to the right or left to repel the attack and escape danger.
[17219.19s -> 17236.84s]  Save the game. Save it. Hurry. What am I holding? This is a really strange thing for me to say,
[17236.84s -> 17245.96s]  but that's inside computer shipping foam. That's exactly what that looks like at sleep.
[17256.95s -> 17261.45s]  If you buy a computer and you have it shipped to you, or if you make a computer for somebody
[17261.45s -> 17265.21s]  and you send it to somebody to protect the components inside, you put this weird foam
[17265.21s -> 17270.49s]  shit that you put it in it. Like it grows and it conforms to all the components. It's really
[17270.49s -> 17292.95s]  actually kind of an interesting thing. All right. I'm going for the coward. You are fucking demented.
[17299.27s -> 17306.30s]  No, people know what I'm talking about. I think I probably could do restaurant man too.
[17310.12s -> 17323.77s]  I just realized what character I am. I'm Rorschach from Watchmen. I'm going to keep this on.
[17338.70s -> 17353.46s]  Oh, the green mask. Rorschach's log. December 25th.
[17356.02s -> 17371.62s]  Stench of blood and foul things plague my nostrils. Hey, that was rough.
[17387.58s -> 17406.25s]  A camera. Oh no, he's going to put this on the internet.
[17421.16s -> 17430.22s]  Salvation. His blood must flow. He must be burned. Yeah. Why would you be filming that?
[17430.22s -> 17454.71s]  Why wouldn't you stop that? Yeah. Let's go. Hey, holy shit. He just charges forward.
[17454.71s -> 17473.94s]  And you guys coward. How about this one? Don't have a cow, man. That's not a heart
[17473.94s -> 17483.11s]  Simpson. What's wrong with me? Get off of me. Did I just end up in a box? Wait.
[17490.26s -> 17502.57s]  It's scripted. Some kind of old fashioned lock device. I need to enter a passcode.
[17503.53s -> 17523.72s]  That's your dad. That's it. Nice try. They all keep doing the same move.
[17524.68s -> 17529.91s]  I got to get it. I got to get it on camera. I've got to get it on camera. The three of them.
[17529.91s -> 17550.62s]  The charge. Come on. There's some Resident Evil shit here.
[17552.06s -> 17562.10s]  Resident Evil 4. It's the same dialogue. Holy fuck. He's running fast. I'm not going to put
[17562.10s -> 17587.85s]  you back in the box. Are you? How am I going to get through this? Oh, I thought I jumped over.
[17591.13s -> 17620.49s]  Give me a knife. Where's the knife? Give me a knife. Oh, I love crunching on their
[17620.49s -> 17641.02s]  Doritos is what gets their attention. That's a lot of PT, right?
[17642.94s -> 17645.74s]  Oh, fuck. That's so many people.
[17650.06s -> 17660.36s]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Not back in the box. That's it. How did none of these guys are dropping
[17660.36s -> 17710.84s]  knives? This is bad. I'm running out of time. Good step letter. I thought I died. Oh, fuck. Oh,
[17716.46s -> 17725.51s]  what? How do I get out of here? What is this? No, no, no. I need a better picture of that.
[17725.51s -> 17744.17s]  Better picture than that. Get fucking stuffed. Carve a box. I just like paper cut that guy's
[17744.17s -> 17761.91s]  face in half. You get the passcode. All right. Get rid of this thing. Did I already get it?
[17768.86s -> 17788.97s]  I already did it? I got it. Okay. Jennifer, are you all right? Why am I out here?
[17799.91s -> 17807.03s]  Oh, where's all my stuff? It's gone. Um, there's a wait a minute. Jill's sandwiches.
[17809.03s -> 17812.55s]  I don't know. I'm not gonna do either one of these. I didn't know where I am.
[17813.35s -> 17835.29s]  Where's their car? I'm not gonna be able to cover. I have to go back. I'm starving to death here.
[17835.29s -> 17846.71s]  What? Ronald? Ronald? Hey, you got some food, right? Split it with me. I'm dying here.
[17855.98s -> 17862.65s]  I don't have any food. I have to bring you food. Here, have some ketchup. Sorry, pal. Fresh out.
[17863.45s -> 17867.94s]  Trying to bowl guard it all for yourself, huh? You're just gonna eat every last morsel?
[17868.82s -> 17880.04s]  Okay. Well, I need to bring food then. There's nothing in this whole restaurant.
[17880.76s -> 17900.71s]  Well, okay. I found restaurant, man. What the fuck? Ronald! Now would be a good time.
[17901.35s -> 17914.98s]  Oh, this sucks. Um, I have to go back. Craft something? What do you mean craft something?
[17915.14s -> 17941.19s]  You craft something? Heat up a pan on the stove. I don't think I have time for this. Another...
[17941.19s -> 17949.11s]  I'm almost... This is almost done. Okay, and then it's on the frying pan. And now how do I...
[17949.11s -> 17966.10s]  What do I do? This is just a hot pan. I don't have any food. Flour? Uh, you're gonna have to stay there.
[17966.10s -> 17986.95s]  I have nothing. I have to go back. This is bad. I gotta go back to another source.
[17987.03s -> 17991.10s]  I gotta go back to another source. This is... This is just... My free-roam time is up.
[17993.78s -> 18000.54s]  Let me don't leave the map. Let's burn this... I bumped into his face.
[18001.26s -> 18011.67s]  All right, I have to go. I don't have food. I'm sorry. I'll go to the guitar shop.
[18012.23s -> 18034.46s]  Just take all the guitars. Food? Wait. No. Ronald, uh, you're dead. Goodbye.
[18037.48s -> 18053.27s]  I'm dead, too. I'm dead, too. I'm dead. I'm fine. All right, so where do I go from here?
[18054.78s -> 18061.10s]  We've got... Uh, I gotta go just down. I could save it. I'm gonna save it. Just because I die.
[18063.70s -> 18088.02s]  That was awesome. Now we just go back. Straight this way. And I end up right...
[18088.82s -> 18103.19s]  Straight ahead. Another source incoming. Why did I do this to myself? What do you want?
[18112.06s -> 18121.77s]  I just fucking breezed through that. That was stupid. What do you mean I'm soft-locked? Why?
[18122.65s -> 18175.58s]  Why would I be soft-locked? Oh shit, this is bad. Made it. Just in time. Motorcycle outside.
[18176.46s -> 18191.00s]  Okay, case four. There's a motorcycle now available. Girl hunting. Plug it back in.
[18191.00s -> 18197.06s]  All right, so I got plenty of time. Is the restaurant... Is he still alive, do you think?
[18197.06s -> 18215.59s]  Is the restaurant man still alive? He might be. Ah, he's dead.
[18229.30s -> 18239.05s]  I understand. Shit, I missed the... I missed the hands in the air. This is an intense conversation.
[18241.93s -> 18246.01s]  Wait, now I gotta get it from the side. Because they're doing the exact same thing. This is a
[18246.01s -> 18257.29s]  mirror. All right, wait till the... Wait till the big... The big one. Here it comes. One, two...
[18266.17s -> 18273.45s]  I haven't saved any pictures in a while. I'll make sure I save those ones.
[18274.17s -> 18304.57s]  Where's pants? There it is. Thank god. All right, I need to heal. Any more things to do?
[18305.69s -> 18312.54s]  Above the law. Okay, so let's do above the law. Do I have time to do them both? We'll find out.
[18326.01s -> 18347.67s]  Save one Ronald. It's the only mental we have of him. Got a little cocky on that one. Why don't I
[18347.67s -> 18363.32s]  heal? Because all I have is like fucking oil and hot sauce. Is there food here? Where is it?
[18363.96s -> 18370.87s]  Where is it? Is OJ here?
[18385.51s -> 18394.92s]  Where? I don't see any OJ. Does it respawn every time? I've already drank it.
[18395.64s -> 18413.83s]  I guess it only spawns once. Pepe hint. OJ. I'm not over here, right?
[18420.42s -> 18429.18s]  Okay. How was that? How's that a bronic? Oh, I just... Okay, I took it. That's my bad.
[18440.01s -> 18444.97s]  All right, let's do it again. Above the law. I think restaurant man is still alive. I think
[18444.97s -> 18456.36s]  Ronald's alive still. Let's see if I can get down there and eat something. I can get to bait him
[18456.36s -> 18466.18s]  out and throw the... Just throw shit at him. Now he is soft-locked. That's right. Yeah.
[18466.34s -> 18495.50s]  What? I understand. Go the other way. What do you mean other way? This is the only way I can go.
[18496.38s -> 18515.91s]  Like this way? Oh, a soccer ball. Oh, what's this? Did he fight the clown yet? Yeah, and I kicked his
[18515.91s -> 18541.70s]  ass. I died. Yeah, I died once. Yeah, I died one time. You got it. That's correct. There's some
[18541.70s -> 18560.34s]  good shit up here. No wine in there? All right, just tell me. There's a pretty big mall that you
[18560.34s -> 18569.51s]  probably need to use. Check the map. Otis, I know. All right, above the law. Let's do it.
[18571.11s -> 18580.70s]  Oh, let's get rid of the... Well, let's do something funny with the hot sauce first.
[18580.70s -> 18596.14s]  You know, throw it at somebody. Is that right? I missed. Does this explode? No, unless you do
[18596.14s -> 18604.04s]  something about it. All right, here we go. I just lost the only health that I picked up. Great. Nice
[18604.12s -> 18608.06s]  work, Jeremy. Everybody is cheering you on right now.
[18615.16s -> 18626.65s]  Restaurant. Restaurant is still up there. If I die again, I'm gonna fucking scream.
[18627.45s -> 18645.45s]  This... No, too many people. Cafe second floor? Is that now? That's today.
[18647.98s -> 18671.69s]  Ronald Shiner is dead. Food. Food. Gray hair. Nothing else I can wear?
[18679.94s -> 18690.62s]  All right, give me a suit or something. Why couldn't there be a suit store?
[18693.03s -> 18721.78s]  And no suit to wear. Yeah, yeah. That's not bad. I don't hate it. You just... I'm turning into the
[18721.78s -> 18733.82s]  Grand Theft Auto V cartridge. Nothing in here. Okay, sporting goods, energy drinks or something
[18733.82s -> 18743.21s]  I can take. I need healing right now. So badly. It's unbelievable to me.
[18743.37s -> 18761.83s]  Out of sight. Glasses? Cool. I'll take them. Let me look at the map. I gotta get used to hitting select.
[18765.13s -> 18772.42s]  So, there's a save point back here. Digital ladies space in the closet. Special gifts.
[18773.06s -> 18785.32s]  Men's apparel. Books. I need like a grocery store or something. Cosmetics. Boutique. I gotta go back
[18785.32s -> 18830.90s]  downstairs. Don't jump. Cheese. Burger cheese. Cheese tits. Cheese tits. I don't want to go that way.
[18831.46s -> 18840.46s]  That's dangerous out there. Food first. I've got plenty of time. We're gonna get something to eat.
[18846.58s -> 18869.98s]  Children's store. Grandma's kids. This thing's still burning? That's kind of unbelievable.
[18870.06s -> 18874.54s]  All right, where do I go? Where do I go for food? I'm not doing another big mission until I get
[18874.54s -> 18898.54s]  some food. Sports high. Gramen's space. Fashion. Apparel. Nothing back here. Uh, how about over here?
[18898.54s -> 18904.04s]  Hamburger fiefdom. Turn around and then take a left at the end of the junction.
[18904.60s -> 18922.22s]  But what did I say? What is it? Beef? Fife?
[18923.18s -> 18941.27s]  Yeah, that was very awkward. All right. Hamburger, uh, beef. Dome. Actually, this way?
[18941.99s -> 18955.05s]  Am I stupid? No, it is this way. Don't die here. Is it? I gotta get an opening.
[18972.89s -> 18989.98s]  Yeah. Hamburger. Fuck the closing in. Hamburger fiefdom. Found it. Please, we have to be food here.
[18990.70s -> 19003.53s]  Orange juice. Oh yeah. Perfect. Any other cans of beans or anything? Canned sauce. Can I eat this?
[19009.40s -> 19014.46s]  Can you actually cook? Or were you guys lying to me? You can't. I'm almost certain of that.
[19021.22s -> 19034.10s]  All right, I got orange juice. Good to go. Let's continue. We've got weapons. We've got health.
[19034.66s -> 19041.05s]  Got a pretty good spot here. Ah, all right. Listen to me. There's a woman taking over the
[19041.05s -> 19046.92s]  children's clothing shop in the entrance plaza. It looked pretty bleak. No more food. All right,
[19046.92s -> 19051.91s]  there is food here. There's milk. There's lots of milk. A woman. That woman who didn't make it.
[19061.80s -> 19074.47s]  Holy shit. That was unbelievable. I don't even know what to say. That was fucking insane.
[19075.43s -> 19086.25s]  It's a pinball machine. Okay, uh, get rid of the brown sugar. I want the milk.
[19086.41s -> 19094.36s]  The guitar sucks. Give me the other two things of milk. Did I already get them? I did. All right,
[19094.36s -> 19113.06s]  let's go. There's pies. I'll take both pies. Safe point. There's one right here. Blender. Ooh,
[19114.18s -> 19130.82s]  is there now? There is a blender over here. I didn't even see it. Milk and pie. It is a
[19130.82s -> 19148.02s]  zombate. Okay, pie and milk again. What does zombate do? Let's take a look. Spitfire.
[19148.82s -> 19163.11s]  Flushes harsh functions from your. All right, no more ingredients. There's two pies.
[19167.42s -> 19180.15s]  Can do double pie. Am I insane or was that like something that they did like glitch out or what?
[19180.95s -> 19215.13s]  It did. Okay, pie. I'm kind of, I need to, I'm running out of time here. Untouchable. Now I'm
[19215.13s -> 19223.54s]  good to go. Let's replace the guitar with the knife. I would say. Yeah. Save. Don't do that.
[19223.54s -> 19238.57s]  Select. Okay. Uh, banger right all the way down. Okay. All the way down. Save the game. Go this
[19238.57s -> 19273.67s]  way. Oh fuck, that's a lot of. Was that a mistake? Huh? Why did I just turn into a ball of like
[19273.67s -> 19303.03s]  bostura? These guys give a lot of experience points. It's worth it. Okay, that guy had
[19303.83s -> 19325.40s]  no hitbox. Oh, he's, he's exploding himself. I get it. Explode. All right. What's that safe point?
[19326.04s -> 19365.21s]  Bathroom. Slip right here. Dumbbell. Take two dumbbells. Save. All right. Out. Here we go.
[19365.21s -> 19376.82s]  So above the law is over here. Is it up or just down that way? Uh, is it in a restaurant or is
[19376.82s -> 19385.91s]  it just down the hall? It's just, it's in wonderland. Ooh, that if it's in wonderland, I can get a, uh,
[19385.91s -> 19405.80s]  a chainsaw. My special red wine shoot. Why is it going again? Sally? Uh, why is the thing moving
[19405.80s -> 19430.58s]  again? Help. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Stay right there. Don't move. Try just to kill them. Um,
[19430.58s -> 19446.94s]  this thing's supposed to break. No! Shit! Zombate. What does that do? Are they coming after me? Oh,
[19446.94s -> 19474.98s]  Nick! It baits the zombies. Well, come on over here, guys. Football tackle. Oh, shit. That was
[19474.98s -> 19486.23s]  a lot of people. Yeah. Okay. Come on. Keep going. Okay. Just a little bit further. How do I get them
[19486.23s -> 19498.42s]  down? Uh, I don't, I need, I need some more damage than this. They're not going to, I don't think I
[19498.42s -> 19519.46s]  can. This is too many. I'll be back. Hang on tight. I don't know what the hell I did that for,
[19519.46s -> 19555.86s]  but I think I missed. Wrong way. Fuck. I gotta go. Excuse me. Oh, God. Why? I just got up there,
[19555.86s -> 19575.37s]  too. They're okay. They're still hanging on. Watch me. Okay. Chainsaw. Now we have some fun.
[19576.33s -> 19631.42s]  Here I come. This is going to be ridiculous. It's already broken. Are you kidding me? Too
[19631.42s -> 19641.19s]  much effort from just one person here. I just like almost spit. When they fall, they land. I'm
[19641.19s -> 19657.83s]  going to take a picture of this. This is going to break too. Pick up the queen. I didn't get it.
[19658.47s -> 19677.53s]  There's so much shit all over the ground. Okay. Got a queen. Don't use it. Yes. Queen. Yes. Queen.
[19677.53s -> 19694.18s]  Yes. Queen. No, no queen. No queen. All right. Queen over here. Don't you dare. Queen it. Okay.
[19694.18s -> 19724.95s]  Um, fall. I got you. How do I get you down? How do I get you down from here? Jump. Can you walk?
[19726.52s -> 19734.78s]  I'm fine. It's nothing. All right. Sally Mills. Um, do you have anything? Do you like have anything?
[19734.78s -> 19773.78s]  I can. Thanks. Here. Take one of these. Take it. All right. Are you good? Nice dive, pal. You hurt?
[19774.34s -> 19789.96s]  I'm all right. Take me with you. Let's go. All right. Now above the law, I need something else.
[19790.52s -> 19800.71s]  This way. There's got to be like a store over here, right? Fashion house. Kelly and Lily.
[19801.94s -> 19804.90s]  There's too many people. They're throwing at me now. There's too many people.
[19805.78s -> 19823.56s]  I've got four people here. Beat up this cop so I can get the gun. Give me that. I swear to God,
[19823.56s -> 19847.86s]  you guys. Just fuck up the fucking stairs. Don't you dare do this to me. I don't care. What?
[19866.98s -> 19873.06s]  See just how shameless you are, you dirty little skank. Say hello to my new friend.
[19874.26s -> 19887.50s]  Not again. Help me. Officer. Officer. Can I talk to you for a minute? I mean,
[19887.50s -> 19891.85s]  uh, look, what did that woman do? Throw the camera.
[19892.73s -> 19904.70s]  Shut your pipe. If you interfere, official police business, start with you before I get to her.
[19904.70s -> 19932.86s]  Is this a boss? Where's my friends? Where are my friends? Are they in here? Here. Take the gun.
[19933.74s -> 19950.09s]  Use it. Use it. Shoot her. Somebody do something. Shoot her. Go and get her. Get her. I'll just do
[19950.09s -> 19959.75s]  this. I'll do this. You, you shoot. Oh fuck. He's going to die. Oh God. He's going to kill him. He's
[19959.75s -> 19971.74s]  going to kill him. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. What do I do? I need to throw a chair.
[19977.05s -> 19990.60s]  No, don't do something. Just keep getting in the way. I don't know. I'm scared.
[19998.63s -> 20017.99s]  Good job, Sally. Sally, good work. Stay right there. Sally, don't move.
[20018.55s -> 20021.75s]  No matter what you do, do not move at all. Stay right there.
[20023.83s -> 20030.41s]  What has he done? I spotted a guy in the cosmetic shop in the entrance closet.
[20030.41s -> 20039.69s]  I think he looks a little odd. You should check it out. I don't have any more weapons.
[20039.69s -> 20079.30s]  This might compromise Sally. Is he going to compromise Sally? I think. I don't know what to do.
[20084.34s -> 20087.86s]  Fuck. Look at all this blood. Gun? No.
[20107.48s -> 20119.80s]  I needed more guns. I needed more weapons. I had an interesting opportunity. Okay. I have
[20119.80s -> 20124.28s]  to save Nick again. I just thought that was another person and it was me and it freaked me
[20124.28s -> 20136.92s]  the fuck out. Okay. Above the law, I need guns. In fact, I've got a better idea. I'm getting
[20136.92s -> 20143.40s]  only chainsaws. Oh, I can't do that. Never mind. I'm just going up there with a chainsaw.
[20147.59s -> 20156.31s]  I just need a couple of distractions. I'm not going to use the chainsaw until I get there.
[20157.27s -> 20187.45s]  I'm ready. Let's go. Get rid of the dumbbell. That was a pretty good throw. It was. Okay. I also
[20187.45s -> 20191.69s]  am going to pick up the other chainsaw and I'm not going to use it for down here. I'm going to
[20191.69s -> 20201.38s]  kill a few people and then I'm going to get a bug. Understand? Do we understand? Mini chainsaw.
[20202.02s -> 20208.68s]  I'll come back. In fact, I could probably use this. Let's put this in place where I know it's
[20208.68s -> 20237.70s]  going to be. You know what? Fuck it. Let's go. Go get that chainsaw. Excellent. Don't use it.
[20238.50s -> 20249.00s]  Back over here. Here we go. I'm going to just, I'm going to get a queen.
[20251.74s -> 20265.00s]  Somebody's going to have a queen in here. Where's the queen? Somebody who's got red eyes.
[20265.72s -> 20273.21s]  Which one of you has red eyes? Show yourself, please. I appreciate it. Picture thought about
[20273.21s -> 20284.55s]  that. Let's get them both in the picture. What do you say? 5,000 points. Pretty good.
[20285.19s -> 20306.76s]  All right. Let me queen. Swing. Swing. What are you doing? You really just let that happen.
[20307.56s -> 20324.34s]  No queens yet. If I die right now, I will be so upset about this.
[20325.70s -> 20339.34s]  I don't want to use the chainsaw. Didn't the queen drop by this point? Man, this is bad.
[20345.93s -> 20369.69s]  I don't need to kill every zombie. No, I just need to kill one queen. Just farm chainsaws.
[20370.25s -> 20385.19s]  That's kind of cheating though, isn't it? Who cares? It's a gray area. Is that a queen? I think
[20385.19s -> 20393.14s]  I got one. That'll be huge if it is. You know what? I'm just going to use it a little bit.
[20393.14s -> 20407.62s]  Just a little bit. That's not a queen. Imagine not cheesing at dead rising.
[20411.51s -> 20431.51s]  Okay. Reading chat. Reading chat. Mistake number one was read chat. I just read it again. I just
[20431.51s -> 20458.14s]  read it again. What am I doing? Fuck it. Good luck. No, I'll come back. Here we go. Don't kill
[20458.14s -> 20482.38s]  her. Don't kill her. Don't kill her. I need a photo. No, that's not good enough. That's so good.
[20482.38s -> 20509.43s]  I'm saving that one. Wasn't centered. It's okay. I can't believe a worthless prick like you.
[20509.43s -> 20533.82s]  You killed me. What the hell? Oh my god. Okay. You obtained the handcuff key. Yeah. Stun gun?
[20534.62s -> 20546.36s]  Okay. So, let's... How do I unlock the keys? I have so... Wait. Stay here. Don't do this yet
[20546.36s -> 20562.66s]  because they're going to get attacked. Right? Oh, this is really bad. I need to... They're coming
[20562.66s -> 20569.03s]  in. They're coming in. I need... I have a queen, right? No, I don't. I still have some of this.
[20575.96s -> 20592.97s]  I didn't leave anybody, right? No, not hold hands. You're injured, but this is going to be really
[20592.97s -> 20629.91s]  bad. I'm going to sneeze. Anybody know? Is the chainsaw spawned? Stay there. Stay there.
[20634.07s -> 20660.71s]  Chainsaw respawned. I need a confirmation. Nice. Beautiful. All right. Now we're going to save
[20660.71s -> 20700.22s]  everybody. We're going to have six people coming. Stay up there. Are they okay? They're fine. They're
[20700.22s -> 20727.35s]  just hanging up. I need a queen. No queens. Finally. Took you long enough. All right. Get down.
[20727.35s -> 20747.08s]  Get down from there. Okay. I apologize in advance. All right. Let's go. Take me with you. We're going
[20747.08s -> 20764.89s]  to have so many people. Any more queens? Queen? Let's go. Talk to me. Talk to me. Talk to me.
[20764.89s -> 20775.19s]  Talk to me. Where do you go? All right. Let's go. No, no, no, no. Nick, where are you going?
[20776.36s -> 20781.11s]  Nick, are you running up to like the girls up here? All right. Everybody follow me.
[20782.01s -> 20791.16s]  We're going to make this real quick. Oh, we went up to the marker. Okay. So this is important.
[20791.16s -> 20802.90s]  What's the fastest way to get over here? There's so many people. The shortcut. Right. Okay. And
[20802.90s -> 20812.79s]  that shortcut is over here. Right. That's the shortcut. Correct. Downstairs and over here.
[20816.42s -> 20828.89s]  Everybody listen to me. This is a shitload of people. One, two, three, four. Sally. I'm going
[20828.89s -> 20832.09s]  to give you guys some weapons or something. Even if it's a toy. I don't care. We need to like work
[20832.09s -> 20844.66s]  together. It's too many people. Let's go down. What can you guys carry? I don't know. This is
[20844.66s -> 20856.55s]  a lot of pressure right now. Which way is it? Up and to the left. Here. Take the gun.
[20857.75s -> 20884.55s]  Kelly, take the gun. Nick, take the gun. Nick, here. Take the gun. Let's go. He's so bad.
[20885.11s -> 20892.54s]  He's so bad at this. Okay. Keep going. Oh, why is he on top of me? Oh, shit.
[20893.02s -> 20894.08s]  Hey.
[20895.66s -> 20906.97s]  It's too many people. I'm fucking crumbling. I'm crumbling. Okay. Come on. Hurry up, Nick. Shoot
[20906.97s -> 20928.89s]  somebody. Let's go. To the left. Bang a left. That way. There it is. Sally, make it. We get six.

[20985.91s -> 21001.45s]  Somebody hurt somebody. Use the chainsaw. Run. Run. Run. Uh-oh. Something's wrong. Sally,
[21002.09s -> 21027.16s]  give me the fucking chainsaw. No. No, Kay. Come on. Go. Let's go. We're so close. Good. Good. Good.

[21059.90s -> 21066.12s]  Get out of the way. Sally's in trouble. No. Turn. Give me this chainsaw.
[21066.92s -> 21075.08s]  Get out of the fucking way. Stop pushing people. Oh, my God. I'm gonna run out of time.
[21075.08s -> 21079.80s]  All right. Get in the bathroom. Get in the bathroom.
[21083.56s -> 21100.55s]  In. Oh. Just press it. They're not gonna all make it. Don't they all have to be in here?
[21100.55s -> 21103.43s]  They all have to be in here, don't they? Is that gonna work?
[21111.86s -> 21116.74s]  None of them made it in. I just want to make that real clear. All you jokers in here.
[21116.74s -> 21130.38s]  Not only one person made it in. He's blocking the way. He's blocking the path. That's the problem.
[21133.51s -> 21168.25s]  Nick Evans defected. I'm gonna fucking throw up. Hello. I spotted somebody in the cosmetic shop.
[21170.25s -> 21174.52s]  Holy shit. That was awesome. What are we supposed to do?
[21174.52s -> 21189.30s]  Did she just shoot herself in the head? What happened?
[21203.06s -> 21206.66s]  I just heard like a gunfire and then a flat landing person.
[21214.34s -> 21220.02s]  Set the marker in the bathroom. Get in here. Oh, now they all. Now they all comprehend it.
[21220.74s -> 21224.50s]  You all get it now? Interesting. I didn't do anything. They all just went one, two, three,

[21248.89s -> 21258.07s]  I can't get it from them. Okay. Now from here, it's as easy as coming out this door,
[21258.07s -> 21282.97s]  taking a left, going in the elevator. Set a waypoint. One, two, three, four, five. One,
[21282.97s -> 21290.18s]  two, three, four, five. Let's go. Who's not in there? Who's not in there? This is so bad.
[21290.18s -> 21297.62s]  I need a weapon. I'm going to teleport. Hold on. Wait, what is that on the ground? I'm going to die
[21297.62s -> 21306.30s]  over here now. What happened? Trade. I don't even care. Just take this. I don't even care if you
[21306.30s -> 21319.18s]  heal. Can I give this to you? Take this, please. I need to use. I need that weapon. This is a fucking
[21319.18s -> 21330.10s]  mess. This is a mess. I just took the zombie bait. Oh, that's bad. Wait, everybody stay back.
[21330.98s -> 21342.28s]  Go that way. I'll be back in a minute. I just need a weapon. Books. Books. Books. Books. Books.

[21419.80s -> 21446.33s]  stop. We got to move now. Who's in trouble? Just make your way over there. Who's grabbed? Who died?

[21468.60s -> 21475.00s]  To swap weapons with Nick? I can't. I have to, like, I can't give him the cash register and
[21475.00s -> 21508.38s]  all there is is shoes. I'm gonna die. Um, Jesus Christ. What happened? This is fucking terrible.
[21515.08s -> 21524.01s]  Okay, everybody stay in the bathroom. Stay in the bathroom. In fact, I still have a heel. Okay,
[21524.01s -> 21537.38s]  this is fine. All of you do not fucking move. Stand in the corner. I need to get a bat in the
[21537.38s -> 21546.30s]  sports store. Where's the sporting goods store? You already fucked it up. Sporting goods store.
[21546.30s -> 21563.86s]  Where are you? Let me see. Toy box. Book store. Let me see the map. Optics. Clothing. Jewels.
[21565.06s -> 21576.52s]  Kids store. DVDs. Reading. Cameras. Shoes. Sandwiches. Toon makers. Where is this?
[21580.14s -> 21605.93s]  Bookporium. Oh, come on. We're the bats. I'll take a skateboard. Golf clubs. Got it.
[21605.93s -> 21608.73s]  Nice. Take just, like, three of them. Who cares? Everyone's gonna have a golf club.
[21609.62s -> 21614.82s]  At least four of us have to have golf clubs. And, you know, get rid of the fucking skateboard. Give
[21614.82s -> 21625.21s]  me that. No, all of us are gonna have bats. It don't matter. It don't matter. It don't matter.
[21625.21s -> 21653.34s]  It doesn't matter. Save it. Where the fuck did I just go? Okay. Hi, guys. How are you? Take a club.
[21659.38s -> 21681.82s]  Nick, take a club. Nick, you welcome. Why won't they take the golf club? I don't have time for this.
[21685.54s -> 21723.10s]  Oh, let's go. Okay. This way. Left. Down. How we doing? We're not doing that too bad.
[21723.10s -> 21725.82s]  We're getting a hairy situation. I have a little bit of chainsaw left.
[21727.90s -> 21756.63s]  Everybody good. Keep going. Don't you dare. Move. K, come on. We're so close. Come on.
[21757.91s -> 21774.41s]  Come on, K. Almost there. Oh, no. No, no, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Guys, just go,
[21774.41s -> 21781.72s]  go, go. Run, run, run. They're slow. They're really slow. Holy shit. The golf club sucks.
[21782.44s -> 21802.73s]  How do I leave? One, two, three, four, five, six. One, two, three, four, five, six. Get away from
[21802.73s -> 21816.97s]  my backswing. Lily, away from the backswing. No, don't fucking ruin this. Everybody go that way.
[21817.21s -> 21855.10s]  Go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Go. Go. Who's dead? I got six turn-ins here.
[21855.10s -> 21870.22s]  Jerry. What was his name? Nick. That was not cool. Come on. Come on. Come on. I know. I know. I know.
[21871.34s -> 21882.36s]  Everybody, this is important. This is really, really important. I need you all
[21883.24s -> 21902.84s]  to just stand literally right there. Okay. Good. One, two, three, four, five, six.
[21904.12s -> 21920.07s]  I'm going to get like fucking 500 million points for this. Two, three, four, five, six. Come on.
[21920.95s -> 21931.94s]  You can do it. Nick, you take, you take up like the whole thing. Just somebody please go.
[21932.82s -> 21944.74s]  You just have to be in this right area. Guys, stop this nonsense. Get up.
[21945.70s -> 21973.58s]  Up. Up. Up. Go. Thank you. One, two, three, four, five, six. All of them. Did I level play? I still
[21973.58s -> 21987.14s]  have like three times. 240,000 people. Holy shit. That's a lot. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, time. Oh, no, no, no,
[21987.14s -> 22003.72s]  no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, no. Where is this? I don't have to go. I have no time.
[22004.44s -> 22005.80s]  I have to save it, but I have no time to save.
[22054.20s -> 22057.00s]  All right. Help me out here, guys. Help me out here. Uh, is there a shortcut? Should I take a
[22057.00s -> 22069.72s]  shortcut? Well, help me out here. Or do I have to run? Just, I have to just run. Just run. Just run.
[22070.44s -> 22081.08s]  Grab a skateboard. Nice. Get off the. Oh, this I screwed up. You come in at the wrong fucking
[22081.08s -> 22107.34s]  times. I got, I can't, I gotta go. I gotta go. No, I don't. Movie land. How did I do three golf
[22107.34s -> 22123.13s]  clubs? That was so stupid. All right. Oh, you can talk to me now. Old man in the antique shop.
[22124.30s -> 22136.81s]  He seems weird. He's calm. No, I'm good. There's more. Spotted a guy at the cosmetic shop at the
[22136.81s -> 22145.26s]  entrance plaza. That's fine. I'm not going to go there. There's a sniper over there probably.
[22145.26s -> 22167.96s]  All this stuff. I was too busy saving six people. Okay. Give me this. Give me this. Get out of the
[22167.96s -> 22189.59s]  way, bitch. It was rude. But circumstance. It's not this way. It's not this way. Turn. Don't blow
[22189.59s -> 22205.90s]  that up. I'll get there. Big bits of rude streamer. Uh, thank you. Nits cat for the 5,000 bits.
[22206.78s -> 22213.02s]  Appreciate it. Thank you. I can't believe you got all six. Thanks for the laughs. Trying to round
[22213.02s -> 22224.28s]  them all up. Loving the stream. Keep it up. Am I going to try to chase this person? I have to beat
[22224.28s -> 22245.08s]  her before I run out of time. Oh, this is not good. This is bad. No. All right. Let's go.
[22245.88s -> 22275.16s]  Did she just crash? I didn't get a single hit. Well, at least I know I can get over there.
[22275.16s -> 22297.06s]  I can go to the gun store. Yeah. I'm going to go to the gun store. That's not a bad idea. All right.
[22297.06s -> 22306.15s]  Let's pull it up. Uh, there's probably a better save point I can do besides this. Just go get
[22306.15s -> 22310.86s]  the OP chainsaw. Let me see if I can do it without it. That's, I don't want to use that as a crutch.
[22314.12s -> 22318.17s]  I have plenty of time to get down here. The gun store is near the bus anyways. Okay.
[22318.17s -> 22329.50s]  Okay. Plus there's a shopping cart there so I can get there quickly.
[22331.42s -> 22334.22s]  I'm just going to get down there. I'm going to save the game in a bathroom that's over there.
[22334.86s -> 22352.94s]  I'm going to use the knife. Not bad. Wrong way. I don't really care about Otis. He's going to
[22352.94s -> 22357.50s]  say the same shit that he said in the Times already. Find the person. Yeah, I don't have time
[22357.50s -> 22379.05s]  for that. I took too long. Okay. Put some shoes on you freak. No, better traction. All right.
[22379.13s -> 22388.66s]  Big deal. I'll get this wall and then when I get in here I got to find a save point
[22388.66s -> 22413.70s]  so I can go right from here. There we go. Not bad. And then in here I'm going to do a little bit of
[22414.50s -> 22429.05s]  investigating. All right. Let me take a look. So in here we've got home and garden,
[22429.05s -> 22440.65s]  movie land. We've got, wait a minute, this is here. Hunting shack. So if I bang a left,
[22441.37s -> 22444.97s]  is there no save point? Okay. There is a save point, but I don't, I don't. Okay. So if I go
[22444.97s -> 22449.61s]  down here through the plaza and then bang a little right in here, there's a firearm shack.
[22450.33s -> 22482.76s]  Okay. You got it. This bullshit. Time for the shit. Okay. Let's go. And there's a save point
[22482.76s -> 22500.81s]  right down there too. I can't take a call and I'm driving. That's not safe. All right. Now wait.
[22500.81s -> 22515.10s]  It's behind me and in the little corner over here. This way. There it is. All the way down.
[22515.74s -> 22524.92s]  Okay. Leave that. Why is this like a cut scene? Who's this?
[22541.10s -> 22552.81s]  Okay. But they're dead. It was just a random person. Now they're dead.
[22556.57s -> 22557.45s]  This is a boss fight.
[22566.18s -> 22591.66s]  I didn't even, I'd missed completely. So there, is this blocking? I don't have any guns.
[22592.30s -> 22598.47s]  He's loading. He's loading. He drinks. Drinks. Drinking. Drinking. Drinking. He's drinking.
[22598.47s -> 22601.99s]  I'm dead. I'm gonna die. I'm dead. How many times have I been like, I'm dead. I'm dead.
[22601.99s -> 22631.10s]  I'm dead. I'm dead. No, that's it. I'm dead. It's bullshit. Oh, it's actual bullshit. Oh well.
[22631.74s -> 22666.10s]  Damn it. Go load up on baseball bats. No, I think I could kill her. It's going to take a little bit
[22666.10s -> 22687.05s]  of crutch bullshit, but I can do it. I also need to save some for tomorrow too.
[22688.09s -> 22694.86s]  Oh, whatever. It's been six hours. Yeah, I don't, I don't, I don't, I want to save it for tomorrow.
[22695.58s -> 22708.78s]  This game's long. Yeah, I'm having fun. No, no, let me just do this first.
[22711.08s -> 22715.69s]  You're only halfway through. That's what I mean. Because I'm streaming this tomorrow.
[22716.57s -> 22737.30s]  So I'd like to have another full stream tomorrow too. All right. This way and then
[22738.18s -> 22748.02s]  let me look at this. Once I get over here, I'm not gonna, how do you even get down that far?
[22748.90s -> 22756.47s]  It's like another six hours. Yeah, that's perfect. I'll, you know, I'll give this one more attempt
[22757.03s -> 22761.64s]  and then we'll call it. If I do it, I do it. And if I don't, I don't. We'll do it again. We'll do it
[22761.64s -> 22767.30s]  tomorrow. Because that will be a good six to seven hours then six to seven hours tomorrow.
[22767.30s -> 22785.59s]  And that lines up pretty perfectly. Don't run straight into nothing. The golf club's really
[22785.59s -> 22801.42s]  awful. Am I going to do death stranding? I don't think so. I don't. And not because I don't think
[22801.42s -> 22811.42s]  the game is going to be any good, but because I think it's going to be long and a lot of story,
[22811.42s -> 22818.02s]  which is good, but I'm not sure that's something I want to scream. No, why would you do that?
[22819.06s -> 22821.35s]  I have plenty of time. I don't have to freak out.
[22821.35s -> 22830.60s]  And now I'm going to try to save it over here. I'm sure it's going to be interesting.
[22835.26s -> 22842.28s]  Go all the way. Where's the safe point? Do I have to go all the way? Maybe I don't have to.
[22843.08s -> 22858.58s]  I'm going to save this in a different slot. Can I bang a right? Where the hell is this?
[22859.91s -> 22880.70s]  Right next to me? Easy. Different slot, just in case something horrible happens.
[22882.50s -> 22888.02s]  Okay. So regardless, I have a way. I'm going to beat it tomorrow because I'm stuck here.
[22888.90s -> 22906.36s]  It's either this or nothing. I have to do it. You were just off camera. Let's see if I can kill him.
[22907.16s -> 22933.24s]  There we go. Got that gun too. Any weapons up here? What's that? A nail gun. I fell off.
[22934.52s -> 22958.33s]  I don't have any heals either. No, I didn't get it. There's no time for this. Just kill her.
[22958.89s -> 22975.80s]  Where are you going? What? Wait, what? Is she coming back? I see a headlight. What the
[22975.80s -> 22980.20s]  fuck just happened? She's not going to come down. You've got to be kidding me.
[22983.05s -> 22997.77s]  All the way up. Am I safe? I'm safe in here. She's a fucking maniac. Have you ever
[22997.77s -> 23015.48s]  rode on a motorcycle before? I'm almost out of time. She just drove away again. I'm going
[23015.48s -> 23047.83s]  to try to crash into her. This is fucking outrageous. She turns so fast like on a dime.
[23047.83s -> 23064.15s]  What if I stay in the corner? She can't get me here. I lost. Okay. So I got to kill her quick.
[23064.79s -> 23075.03s]  I'll give it one more time. One more time. Maybe just hit her in the head with a board.
[23075.03s -> 23086.15s]  I don't know. I wonder how do I get, can I get it off of the, there's a sword shop next to her.
[23086.87s -> 23091.13s]  I don't even think the shopping cart's not doing anything for me right now.
[23093.53s -> 23100.41s]  Wait, is there? What is it? Sean's food, CD crazy, and then Ripper's blade is just straight ahead.
[23101.53s -> 23109.43s]  Try the bomb cart. I have to make it explode, don't I? That's a lot, asshole.
[23110.47s -> 23118.41s]  You don't have any time to do this. This is precious seconds I'm wasting.
[23120.95s -> 23123.51s]  Just for the love of God, this is fucking sacred. Get away from me.
[23124.47s -> 23143.00s]  Okay, let's try it. Can I just put it down in front of her? Um, it's gone. Just true.
[23143.88s -> 23154.81s]  They don't really give you even one tenth of a second, do they? I just want to see what's even
[23154.81s -> 23173.86s]  in the fucking room. What the hell is this encounter? It's because I'm not wearing shoes?
[23174.66s -> 23190.44s]  That's not real. What do you mean yes? I have a handicap because I don't have shoes on.
[23190.76s -> 23200.54s]  Don't tell me that's real. Is that real? All right, she's not going to come in here.
[23200.54s -> 23215.93s]  And if she does, then she's in trouble. Okay, what do we got? I can't even open the goddamn
[23215.93s -> 23224.92s]  case. Thanks for opening the case. Why are you even in here? Oh my God, I want to fucking bury you.
[23226.28s -> 23242.84s]  Katana. All right, all it takes is one good Katana swing. This is like the sloppiest fight ever.
[23242.84s -> 23283.67s]  I feel like I'm playing GTA right now. Jesus. She's stuck. She's moving around like a mouse.
[23284.47s -> 23301.56s]  Okay, got it. Got one hit on her. I have an idea. I'm gonna try to bait her into the shop
[23301.56s -> 23305.80s]  and have her stuff in the shop and get stuck in there. Let's see if it works.
[23316.36s -> 23338.07s]  You. Give me your gun. No gun? Didn't have a gun. Any more police? Here we go. She's in.
[23338.63s -> 23359.37s]  She's in. Come on. Get in. She was in. God damn it, she was in. I had her in. This is the most
[23359.37s -> 23376.79s]  absurd thing I've ever seen. Let's go. Now you're gonna use your gun. Get in, get in. In, in, in.
[23376.79s -> 23392.18s]  Is she in? Fuck. Wasn't the best. I'll take the sword. All right, time to slay the dragon.
[23392.82s -> 23428.79s]  Can I like queue it up? That's the play. That's the play. That's the only way this is going to
[23428.79s -> 23436.38s]  work. I have to do that like 10 times in a row. Well, she just gets. I don't even know what the
[23436.38s -> 23442.84s]  actual strategy here is. What are you actually supposed to do here? What's like the real way
[23442.84s -> 23455.22s]  to do this? You have to use a gun. What if I don't have a gun? I need food and guns. Well,
[23455.22s -> 23464.44s]  I don't have any time for that. I have to win. Is there any place over here? There's food over here
[23465.16s -> 23468.09s]  I could get a bunch of food, but I'm not going to do it in time.
[23474.54s -> 23486.15s]  Guns. I need a gun. Police. Come here. You got a gun. Give that to me.
[23488.33s -> 23499.24s]  Get the fuck out of here. All right, hold on. Give me the O2 tank. You've got two? No. All right,
[23499.24s -> 23515.11s]  I have a gun. You've got two? No. Okay. Where's that O2 tank? There it is. Don't shoot the O2
[23515.11s -> 23547.43s]  tank. Give me the tank. It fucking despawns. Oh my god. That's so stupid. You have no time.
[23548.39s -> 23585.50s]  I can't even go in the... Is there somebody else in here? What? Okay, so you can't go in there.
[23586.14s -> 23592.87s]  I have to shoot her with that gun. I have to shoot at the propane tank. It has to be more
[23592.87s -> 23600.22s]  perfect than landing a fucking triple axle in the Olympics. Where's the guy with the gun? Over here.
[23600.54s -> 23614.17s]  I've got three guns. I've got to save it right now. Get the fucking stupid NPC shitheads. Get away
[23614.17s -> 23620.97s]  from me. Get out of here. Is this three? Oh, I am so angry right now. You have no idea. This is so
[23620.97s -> 23657.21s]  stupid. Give me this. God damn it. Don't tell me it's because I don't have any shoes on.
[23657.93s -> 23681.19s]  Nice climb, Frank. Where are you? Where? This is fucking unbelievable.
[23681.99s -> 23690.30s]  How do you ever... Mouse and keyboard. How do I aim? How do I aim with mouse? What's like zoom in?
[23690.30s -> 23708.25s]  What's aim on mouse? It's not right click. W? Q? Get back here. Why would Q be... I'm so upset by that
[23708.25s -> 23721.94s]  one. Where did she go? This game makes no sense. What the hell is going on right now? What is going
[23721.94s -> 23761.51s]  on? This is fucking ridiculous. This is like I'm dead. Oh my god. Just throw katanas at her.
[23762.62s -> 23777.93s]  Strategy number two incoming. It just happens every fucking time. Keep using the gun. I can't
[23777.93s -> 23782.73s]  get a good shot. She rips around so much. Even when you shoot her, sometimes you hit her in the
[23782.73s -> 23794.95s]  motorcycle. I'm just going in here. Go ahead, spin around. Nice turning. Great programming on the
[23794.95s -> 23810.66s]  turning of the bike there. Who did that? It's bad. Give me the knives. Fuck out of here. Let's go.
[23811.38s -> 23845.22s]  She's spinning in circles now. No fucking way. It's possible, but can I even do this in time?
[23866.14s -> 23869.10s]  I don't know how much time I actually have left.
[23869.10s -> 23895.51s]  Okay, okay. No, man. No, no. I have to swing when she gets close. It's my easier set than done.
[23897.74s -> 23905.03s]  Just jump kick her. All right. Honest to god. I'm going to break this thing in half. Why does
[23905.03s -> 23922.47s]  this Xbox One control suck such asshole? I don't understand. She hasn't even run into me. It's
[23922.55s -> 23940.28s]  already over. My god, this thing sucks. You got to be fucking kidding me. What a piece of dog shit.
[23941.74s -> 23949.88s]  Why is it disconnected? What? She was waiting for me to be plugged back in. At least I appreciate
[23949.88s -> 23976.79s]  that. That's nice of you. I think I might just lose this. Hey, wait a minute. That jump scare is
[23976.79s -> 23981.70s]  out the window. Hi, guys. Yeah, we were just waiting for you. When you turn the corner,
[23981.70s -> 23994.95s]  we just all bite you at the same time. The thing doesn't even do anything. And the guns,
[23994.95s -> 24003.80s]  I feel like they do like a sliver of health. Throwing the katanas was doing more damage.
[24004.36s -> 24024.44s]  You had a bigger gun. Look at the time. I might have to go back to one of the other saves. It's
[24024.44s -> 24043.64s]  actually fucking broken. I'm going to mail this thing back to fucking Microsoft. This is so fucking
[24043.64s -> 24058.74s]  broken. No, she was just, she was just stuck right here.
[24061.90s -> 24082.60s]  This is unfucking believable. Just shoot her. Just shoot her. I can't even do enough damage to her.
[24099.88s -> 24104.12s]  All right. Is it like a chandelier that I can drop on her fucking head or something? Like,
[24104.12s -> 24121.85s]  seriously? This seems so outrageously stupid. Even with a gun. This isn't it, man. I just don't have
[24121.85s -> 24136.49s]  enough time. So I just lose. I'm just going to lose. Go get the gun from the fountain. I'd love
[24136.49s -> 24142.65s]  to play. All right. All right. All right. All right. I'm done. Game over. I'm done. I have to,
[24142.65s -> 24146.57s]  I have to like fix this. I can't play with keyboard and mouse right now. I'm playing for like
[24146.57s -> 24161.88s]  seven hours with controller. I have to figure out why this keeps disconnected. We're going to do
[24161.88s -> 24169.99s]  it tomorrow. I'm going to figure it out tomorrow. I'm going to go to the fountain. You know, just
[24169.99s -> 24189.75s]  kill me. Here she comes. Oh, insult to injury ran over my head. You got to get shoot. All right.
[24189.75s -> 24200.30s]  Where was, I'm just curious. So this is, I have two saves here. Where is this one? It's all the way
[24200.30s -> 24216.47s]  back. All right. Fountain, Uzi. I don't even know how to use the map. Is it M? Okay. Where's that
[24216.47s -> 24224.34s]  fountain? I have no idea even how to control this fucking game with a keyboard. What is going on?
[24230.44s -> 24241.59s]  All right. There's the food court. Where's the fountain? Not up here. This game sucks laughing
[24241.59s -> 24256.52s]  my ass off. It doesn't though. It actually doesn't. All right. So it's here. Can I get here
[24257.64s -> 24264.65s]  and then up here? I'm going to have to just run over this way, grab a skateboard and skateboard
[24264.65s -> 24284.97s]  all the way around. Is that going to work? I don't know. Into the food court, grab some food.
[24287.61s -> 24293.86s]  Hold on. Do I even have like another plug I can try? I'm so irritated by this. What a cheap piece
[24293.86s -> 24302.26s]  of shit. Seriously. Yeah. Like coffee pays like fucking 500 million of these things and then
[24302.26s -> 24317.51s]  dump them up at 80 bucks. Give me a break. We'll go ahead and send that to our quality control
[24317.51s -> 24337.02s]  department and maybe they'll figure it out. Oops. All right. I'm done. All right. That's it. That's
[24337.02s -> 24339.74s]  it. I'm not going to search around. I'm done. We'll come back tomorrow.
[24339.74s -> 24351.02s]  This is the real anger time. Real anger hours. No, I'm having fun. It's just what the fuck is
[24351.02s -> 24356.30s]  going on here with this controller. Why are you doing this, man? Don't want to rant. All right.
[24356.30s -> 24363.50s]  I'll tell you. Let me tell you something about fucking Xbox. No. We'll go tomorrow. We'll go
[24363.50s -> 24368.20s]  tomorrow. Let me get like a new controller because here's what's going to happen. I'm telling you.
[24368.84s -> 24373.56s]  I am going to get to where I was with the keyboard and mouse and I'm not going to get the control
[24373.56s -> 24377.80s]  right and I'm going to like right click when I should have hit Q and it's going to be the make
[24377.80s -> 24381.32s]  or break the rest of the stream and I'm going to be very bad and I'm going to go back and I'm going
[24381.32s -> 24386.92s]  to talk about Microsoft again. I'm going to go on a huge rant about how I should have had the
[24386.92s -> 24398.14s]  controller and if I had a controller it's fucking stupid. We'll start tomorrow. Just rewind to
[24398.14s -> 24411.62s]  right click. That's so close. Damn it. Whatever. It's all good. We want a rant. No, it's all good.
[24411.62s -> 24416.15s]  It's all good. We're good. I'll see you guys tomorrow. We're going to finish this game
[24416.15s -> 24426.90s]  and hopefully by then I will have a controller that doesn't just disconnect for no reason.
[24426.90s -> 24432.90s]  No funny zoo game? Um, no, not until this is done and maybe not again. I don't know. We'll see.
[24434.36s -> 24441.75s]  We're just playing at zoo. I just played it yesterday. No, no, no, not. I don't know. We'll
[24441.75s -> 24446.14s]  find out. We're going to be stuck on the boss for the whole next stream. No, we won't
[24447.32s -> 24452.36s]  because I'm going to look up how to beat it by incredibly cheeseball dog shit strategy.
[24453.30s -> 24460.47s]  I'm just going to type in motorcycle lady cheeseball strategy and just look it up.
[24460.47s -> 24468.73s]  Whatever. Who cares? And we'll see what happens tomorrow. I had a lot of fun with this game,
[24468.73s -> 24471.93s]  though, besides the random like three or four times where I was just like,
[24474.33s -> 24483.96s]  so it's been fun. I'll see you guys tomorrow. Same time, same place. Did you hear the dog?
[24483.96s -> 24498.82s]  I think he's yelled at me. That was Dead Rising part run, guitar part run. Actually,
[24498.82s -> 24513.05s]  that was what I was doing the whole time. Let's do the bits. You know, sometimes I just check to
[24513.05s -> 24523.24s]  see if this works, but it doesn't. That's all right. That's going to be the YouTube title.
[24523.96s -> 24533.16s]  All right. So seven hours ago here we had a dog. Oh, good boy. Thanks to the 500 bits. Are you
[24533.16s -> 24538.98s]  going to attempt the seven day survival challenge after you beat the game? Uh, I don't even know
[24538.98s -> 24551.78s]  what that is. We'll have to see, uh, after what happens tomorrow. Thank you. The 500 bits judging
[24551.78s -> 24556.66s]  by how well I am able to manage, uh, most of the survivors. I don't think that's going to happen.
[24556.66s -> 24563.43s]  What is that? If you die once, you just, it's over. It's like hardcore mode. That would be so
[24563.43s -> 24570.63s]  horrible. Seven days is like hard mode. Yeah. Don't you have an appointment tomorrow? No,
[24570.63s -> 24576.70s]  I had it wrong. It's the next day. So we're streaming tomorrow. Sticks renegade. Thanks
[24576.70s -> 24582.38s]  for the 250. If memory serves me right, the best weapon is the mannequin torso. I remembered it.
[24582.38s -> 24592.46s]  One shot most zombies in this good durability. That's a good tip. I'll take it. It's seven real
[24592.46s -> 24609.00s]  days. A long time. It's a very long time. Uh, I'll try it out. I'll try it tomorrow.
[24609.64s -> 24613.35s]  Rock Esper. Thanks for the 250. Hey, Jeremy, you never talk about this sort of stuff.
[24613.35s -> 24620.39s]  The character, Jesse, the blonde girl. Do you find her attractive? Just say yes or no. I paid money
[24620.39s -> 24635.74s]  for this. I don't even know. I don't even remember what the hell that was. I have no idea. Is it a
[24635.74s -> 24649.46s]  character in this game? There's a lot of people that I've come across. All right. Good answer.
[24650.10s -> 24653.66s]  Okay. It's the only answer because I really don't even know who they're talking about.
[24656.76s -> 24660.68s]  But thank you for the 250. Appreciate it. Thank you. Bobo Durango for the 300 bits.
[24661.24s -> 24665.48s]  Jeremy, there's a secret Katana sword weapon on the awning. If you jump off the second floor,
[24665.48s -> 24671.32s]  food court real. Right. I look, okay. I know that there's like secret weapons and items.
[24672.65s -> 24679.27s]  I don't know. That's there. I have no idea. Jump off into the awning and grab the Katana.
[24679.83s -> 24686.38s]  That's meta gaming. He told you. Well, now I know it's there and that's cheating, but it's
[24686.38s -> 24692.46s]  okay. We're cheating now because I don't care. Tell me everything. Tell me where the bazooka is
[24692.46s -> 24712.10s]  so I can stuff it into that fucking girl on the bike's face. GTA hacker. But yeah, I'll start
[24712.10s -> 24724.86s]  picking it up. Thank you too. Kimono friend zone. Thanks for the 1500 bits. 15 bucks.
[24725.58s -> 24729.06s]  Jeremy, not even kidding. The mannequin torso is the most powerful weapon in the game.
[24729.86s -> 24743.61s]  He's like, I was like angry with me right now. Why? He just like, Hey, what is he doing? He's
[24743.61s -> 24747.99s]  like, let me out. Let me out. Where he's going. Let me see what he's doing. Let me just see what
[24747.99s -> 24787.56s] 's wrong with him. He's yelling at me. Perfect. Uh, I don't know. He just, he's just sitting outside
[24787.56s -> 24796.23s]  my door going like, Hey, he's eating. He's been outside and now he's just hanging on. Okay. Well,
[24796.31s -> 24805.18s]  see what you want in just a few minutes. He talks. Yeah, but I'll try the mannequin torso tomorrow.
[24805.18s -> 24815.59s]  Maybe I can even kill her with a mannequin torso. Thank you. Dark soul for the 250. I feel like I
[24815.59s -> 24819.99s]  should leave a serious one. Thanks for all the streams and I hope you don't take our memes too
[24819.99s -> 24825.11s]  seriously. Don't worry. I do not. We only tease because we love our streamer. Jerma Hart also
[24825.11s -> 24829.67s]  chat. There's a burner cell phone taped underneath your chair. Go to the basement of Caesar's palace
[24829.67s -> 24845.61s]  and call the number. Jerma isn't who he says he is. Thank you. Okay. Thanks for the 250. Appreciate
[24845.61s -> 24852.94s]  it. Thank you. Al 2653 for the thousand bits. Jerma, let me give you a couple of basic tips
[24852.94s -> 24857.03s]  for the game. Always keep a couple of healing items on you. Arrange weapon and a couple of
[24857.03s -> 24861.83s]  good melee weapons at all times. Keep it out for save points too. Save anytime you enter a new area,
[24861.83s -> 24866.07s]  baby. And ultimately keep an eye on your main quest religiously. Keep it up, man. We all love
[24866.07s -> 24873.10s]  you. Even when you get, we get angry too. I mean, I was told that dead rising is an angry game.
[24873.10s -> 24879.51s]  Before I played dead rising, somebody told me, Hey, the bosses in that game are dog shit.
[24880.23s -> 24884.90s]  I was like, we talking about what? Yeah. You're going to get really annoyed with them.
[24884.90s -> 24899.45s]  I'm like, no, I'm dead rising. This is me in the mirror, by the way. Somebody, somebody just,
[24899.45s -> 24905.61s]  somebody just said that like 40 minutes ago. And then because somebody said it in chat, it was like,
[24906.71s -> 24907.67s]  I can say it now too.
[24910.79s -> 24914.34s]  I really like dead rising, but like the boss is really like fucking like dumb.
[24915.14s -> 24919.16s]  The boss is like dumb. The boss is a dumb. I didn't say it. The boss is a dumb.
[24919.16s -> 24925.61s]  And then I'd say people like, what are you talking about? Oh, somebody said that. Like somebody said
[24925.61s -> 24938.94s]  that in chat. I'm just like, I, yeah, that's, you think that too? Local comedians stealing
[24938.94s -> 24947.27s]  joke from the audience. I was saying that a boss is dumb, a joke. I'm not going to get on
[24947.27s -> 24957.16s]  Johnny Carson with that one guys. I never said it was funny. That's true. You know, you're right.
[24963.88s -> 24966.68s]  All right. Colusia. Thanks for the 250. Hey, let's put the credits up too.
[24972.38s -> 24975.50s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[24975.50s -> 24984.04s]  Colusia. Thanks for the 250. Hey, what's up? It's my birthday this Friday. So here's some
[24984.04s -> 24989.00s]  pre-birthday money. Also, do you think you could say my name Mia so I can edit it into the rat's
[24989.00s -> 24993.56s]  birthday mix tape? Yeah, absolutely. Thanks, Jerma. Much love. You don't even need to edit it.
[24994.28s -> 25000.92s]  Happy birthday, Mia. Mia. It's your birthday today. Ice cream and shit is on the way.
[25004.06s -> 25018.98s]  Use that. Thanks everybody for your subs. You continued subscriptions. It's sorry. I just like
[25018.98s -> 25024.82s]  fucking completely blanked. I'm looking at my phone. I just like thanks for the subs and
[25025.46s -> 25033.08s]  what I said. Like I had a notification on my phone and my brain turned off. Okay, we're back.
[25033.08s -> 25038.15s]  No sirs. Thanks everybody for the subs and your extraordinary support of the channel.
[25038.95s -> 25044.33s]  It means a lot. He would rather look at his phone. No, no, no. I just it was like a like the
[25044.33s -> 25050.86s]  my light on my phone lit up and I have like the brain of a fucking squirrel or something
[25050.86s -> 25062.50s]  like a rat phone. Yeah, because I don't have notifications to sound on during a stream.
[25063.22s -> 25079.54s]  Otherwise, he would just be like, you guys don't want to hear that. But happy birthday to Mia.
[25079.54s -> 25084.26s]  Thank you. Sad Vega. Thanks for the 250. If there is ever a zombie apocalypse, you don't get to be
[25084.26s -> 25091.48s]  the leader. Yeah, people were like giving me shit about you'd be so bad. There's all the
[25091.48s -> 25096.86s]  apocalypse. You don't know where you are. Like as if I'm just blindfolded walking around my house.
[25102.70s -> 25107.90s]  You know, I don't need to know where I am. I just need to move my arms up and down left and right
[25107.90s -> 25118.95s]  real fast, really hard with a sword. I can do that really well. And a shitload of canned food.
[25125.45s -> 25133.00s]  Oh, okay. So I'm apparently doing it wrong. I'm just gonna have a go kart that's full
[25133.56s -> 25142.42s]  with like a train of wagons behind me that all has canned food in it. That's all gonna be covered
[25142.42s -> 25156.86s]  up. So nobody knows what it is. He's gonna starve within 24 hours. That face when you got to kill
[25156.86s -> 25187.59s]  zombie germ of Pepe hands. No, I am returning. It's not gonna happen. I'm too sneaky. But thank you.
[25187.59s -> 25193.83s]  Sad Vega. Gnarly. Thanks for the 250. Ever gonna do another system games collection stream like
[25193.83s -> 25198.06s]  you did with the dreamcast and PlayStation might be something might be fun with something like the
[25198.06s -> 25212.01s]  GameCube or DS. Um, not in the immediate future. I mean, the GameCube is really cool. But I would
[25212.01s -> 25224.78s]  need to, you know, I at one point, I was thinking about I wanted to do an Atari stream. Just get all
[25224.78s -> 25229.34s]  the old old Atari games and play them all. There's many as I could. And over the course of a day or
[25229.34s -> 25234.30s]  two, that stream would probably get really boring though, because every Atari game is almost the
[25234.30s -> 25245.08s]  same game. So after like 25 Atari games, it'd probably be like, okay, there's only so many
[25245.08s -> 25257.03s]  stick figure jumps across the lake that we can do in a row. But I think about it sometimes.
[25260.22s -> 25271.78s]  I guess the the progression PlayStation, PlayStation 2, Dreamcast, GameCube,
[25271.78s -> 25280.06s]  Nintendo 64. There's a lot of them. Are you ever gonna play code vein? I forgot about that. I bought
[25280.06s -> 25295.35s]  it to to stream it. I don't know. You said you were gonna play it. Yeah, I know. Well, I said I
[25295.35s -> 25303.13s]  wanted to. And then I put a vote up, I think. And like 12% of people clicked on code vein. It was
[25303.13s -> 25319.90s]  like, at least make a dumb character in it. That's because we had the thing. That's true.
[25321.27s -> 25325.59s]  Maybe I'll revisit it soon. I don't know. I can't get I don't want to get everybody's hopes up and
[25325.59s -> 25335.78s]  just be like, yeah, maybe. I don't know. I don't really have a plan. But hey, errorless. Thanks
[25335.78s -> 25343.96s]  for the 250. Jerma Saturn. Cool. So underused emote, I think. Dr. Clay, thanks for the 250.
[25343.96s -> 25354.17s]  I haven't even I haven't seen you get that mad since Hotline Miami. When? Wait, what this what
[25354.17s -> 25365.38s]  just happened? When did when did I get mad? I mean, during the motorcycle part? Oh, absolutely.
[25366.02s -> 25371.78s]  This was that was seven minutes ago. So angry. Somebody already has a clip of this.
[25372.74s -> 25376.98s]  Yeah, I mean, well, come on. Like I'm getting like turned on a dime with a lady on a motorcycle.
[25377.78s -> 25385.86s]  That's like that's that's bullshit. She's driving through debris like it's nothing.
[25393.56s -> 25399.32s]  Stupid like NPC shitheads. Get away from me. Get out of here. This is three. Oh,
[25399.32s -> 25413.90s]  I am so angry right now. You have no idea. This is a stupid. Oh, I cooled off right there. That's
[25413.98s -> 25430.78s]  fine. It was a little bit. That's not Hotline Miami tear anger. It is not. Not. No, no, no. I
[25430.78s -> 25437.43s]  can tell you as the guy sitting in the chair, not even close. Not even close. Oh, Hotline Miami. I
[25437.43s -> 25444.78s]  was just I hated it. I like hated it. There was like three levels in a row there. I was just like,
[25444.78s -> 25454.18s]  oh, it was inconsolable. I hated that. He hates it. Hotline Miami. No, it was Hotline Miami 2.
[25454.66s -> 25462.28s]  That's probably the most upset I've ever been on stream like recorded. Hotline Miami 1. I don't
[25462.28s -> 25471.21s]  think I had a problem with it. It was two. Yeah. So if you got a level between like Hotline Miami 2
[25471.21s -> 25479.10s]  is up at the top and drinking while playing Nintendo Labo is at the bottom. That was probably
[25479.10s -> 25490.30s]  somewhere into like the thing stream number two when I was walking around that corridor for like
[25490.30s -> 25504.89s]  20 minutes. That's like maybe like two or three rungs below Hotline Miami 2. But that didn't even
[25504.89s -> 25512.10s]  last that long. And no, no, no. Yeah, that that clip right there was like the extent of me being
[25512.10s -> 25516.47s]  upset with Dead Rising. I was like, no, I was mad at the controller because my controller kept
[25516.47s -> 25527.94s]  fucking going crazy. I'm out of the game. I know that's incredibly that's a meme. I was mad at the
[25527.94s -> 25533.42s]  controller. My controller is fucked up. My controller is broken. It was. I didn't do it.
[25533.42s -> 25539.37s]  I didn't even need to prove that. Imagine if I was just unplugging it on purpose over and over
[25539.37s -> 25554.66s]  again and like pretending to be angry with it. That would be such a pain in the ass. That would
[25554.66s -> 25564.65s]  be a pain in the ass. But imagine now I said it and now it's in people's heads and you can never
[25564.65s -> 25569.93s]  take it back. Anyways, thank you to DrSteam for the 500 vids. Jerma, are you going to participate
[25569.93s -> 25578.22s]  in the big Minecraft streamer only event that takes place on a huge world map? No. Do you even
[25578.22s -> 25589.50s]  know about it? I do not and I probably I'm not going to be participating. Yo, that sounds pog.
[25590.06s -> 25604.17s]  I mean, that sounds pretty cool. We already signed you up. That's not how this works. You
[25604.89s -> 25612.60s]  you guys aren't like my parents making sure I do some extracurricular activities. So you
[25612.60s -> 25627.10s]  signed me up for like the French horn. That's not how this works. We said you would host it.
[25627.10s -> 25636.76s]  Oh wow, that would be ridiculous. No. Okay, I need to stop talking because let me be very clear
[25636.76s -> 25644.65s]  here. I am not going to participate in that event. I wish him luck. Sounds cool. I will not be

[25684.39s -> 25691.11s]  people are speaking English. What is it? What are you talking about? There are two. Most of the people
[25691.11s -> 25703.30s]  are ESL. Oh okay. You should have a career day stream where us fans can show you our unique jobs.
[25703.38s -> 25710.76s]  Well I'd love to chat more but it's uh but it but at his point it's cheaper to talk to a

[25718.81s -> 25737.51s]  fuck is going on here? BF Bugleberry could use a bath bomb. What are these comments? I mean I kind
