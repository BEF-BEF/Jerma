[28.02s -> 31.86s]  Hey guys, remember Jerma promised to play Dead Space before his 40th birthday.
[33.05s -> 52.25s]  Um, that's true. No, that's true. I got a while. Still, uh, still fine with that statement,
[52.25s -> 66.49s]  by the way. Am I doing today? I'm doing good. I am doing good. I have been itching to play
[66.49s -> 75.38s]  Armored Core, but I decided I wasn't going to play it off stream. I decided I was going to
[75.38s -> 92.79s]  continue to play it on stream. We'll see after today. It's fun. I'm going to have to re-familiarize
[92.79s -> 98.30s]  myself with the controls because it has been a week and a half or so since I played it.
[100.94s -> 109.24s]  By the way, yes, there is a logo on my character and it's one that I made. I got kind of
[109.96s -> 114.28s]  inspiration. I saw, hey, look at these decals. Look at these decals. I'm going to make one.
[114.84s -> 121.11s]  Let me try making one. Mine's not as good as the others I've seen, but hey,
[121.99s -> 128.10s]  this editor is a lot of fun. It reminds me of the, uh, the 2k14 editor,
[129.30s -> 139.38s]  just way better than the new ones. Uh, I don't know what boss people are referring to,
[139.38s -> 147.67s]  but I don't think I've seen it yet. He's fishing for compliments. Yeah, I spent a little time on
[147.67s -> 159.50s]  it. So it's all right. What do you guys think? Bro, you're going to get filtered. We already
[159.50s -> 174.15s]  went over this that I, I, that's not here. That's not accurate here. Come on, give it a rest. Let
[174.15s -> 182.06s]  him fish. He deserves compliments. Oh, by the way, have I ever clearly stated that frozen red grapes
[182.06s -> 189.83s]  are the best snack in the world? Have I been on the record saying that yet? Did I, have I actually
[189.83s -> 197.02s]  been on the record saying that? Frozen red grapes is the single best possible thing that the human
[197.02s -> 210.89s]  body can eat. Like I'm convinced they are so unbelievably good. It's not even funny. Those of
[210.89s -> 218.49s]  you that have never had, remember frozen all the way through none of this half frozen shit, because
[218.49s -> 227.24s]  it takes a little while for them to freeze all the way through. Red grapes, wash them, you know,
[227.24s -> 234.54s]  take off the stem, get them in a little container, freeze them overnight. You open that, eat one,
[234.54s -> 241.58s]  don't just chomp right into it. Let it sit for a minute, bite into it. You know, it's frozen,
[241.58s -> 246.04s]  so it's going to be really cold. Just to make sure you know that you're into that. It's like
[246.04s -> 256.28s]  one of the greatest snacks ever. I eat them almost every day or every other day. They just, grapes
[256.28s -> 261.91s]  are so much better when they're frozen. I don't even really like grapes. They're good. They're
[261.91s -> 268.78s]  okay. But holy shit, you freeze them and it's, it changes everything. The whole thing changes.
[271.06s -> 276.70s]  Yeah. If you have sensitive teeth, be careful, but they don't. Oh my God. It's not like an ice
[276.70s -> 284.73s]  cube. They turn into this weird, like chewy jelly is the only way I can describe it.
[285.45s -> 293.74s]  If you know, you know, it's unbelievable. And all the people saying, ew, you just,
[294.70s -> 299.42s]  open up your, open up your mind a little, please open up your mind a little. You can say ew to
[299.42s -> 310.33s]  frozen grapes. Open your mind a little, please. What kind of grapes? Just, just red grapes. Green
[310.33s -> 317.40s]  grapes are okay with this formula, but it's the red ones, the smaller red ones that are way better.
[320.94s -> 327.72s]  Seedless, seedless grapes. No, they're not crunchy. They're chewy. You'll get it when you
[327.72s -> 332.04s]  understand. And I'm telling you, it's like going to be like a five gum commercial. When you eat
[332.04s -> 337.45s]  one of these, I just changed your life. Well, I didn't. That sounds like I'm taking credit for
[337.45s -> 343.14s]  that. I had frozen grapes a lot when I was younger. Something was like, you know what? I'm
[343.14s -> 348.55s]  going to do it. I feel like doing it. So I'm going to freeze some. So I, frozen grapes are going to
[348.55s -> 361.35s]  change your life. Not me. You see, I made this up. This is, I came up with this. All right. You guys
[361.35s -> 368.42s]  good? I'm going to play, um, Armored Core 6, stream for a little bit. We'll see if, uh, if I'm still
[368.42s -> 373.42s]  into it in another hour or two, maybe I just keep playing it. If not, after like an hour or two,
[374.06s -> 378.23s]  I kind of want to play coin game. I got an update a few months ago. They added a bunch of new
[378.23s -> 394.18s]  machines and stuff. I like playing it. So we'll see. I'm just going to wing it today. Uh, here we go.
[394.18s -> 408.17s]  Oh, let me show you my, uh, my unit. Wait, should it be a surprise? Uh, let's see. There we go.
[408.97s -> 422.36s]  Ah, take a look. Oh, see, I made this one. It sucks. That's how you can tell. I made this one.
[422.36s -> 426.20s]  I got inspiration from everybody that was making them. I was like, you know what? I'm going to try.
[426.20s -> 435.35s]  I made, I made 10 minutes. It took me like 15 minutes, 10 minutes. Yeah. I, I told you I was
[435.35s -> 448.39s]  going to do it actually pretty nice. I've seen some really clean ones. I think the teeth are a
[448.39s -> 457.51s]  little fucked up. I think I may have messed the teeth up a little, but it's okay. You can make
[457.51s -> 466.92s]  the paint have no wear. I kind of like the wear. Cool. All right. I'm ready. So is this the mission
[466.92s -> 475.18s]  that everyone's going to laugh at me for? Is this like the, here it is. Operation Wall Climber.
[475.18s -> 484.90s]  All right, let's just go. I'm ready. How's the audio? Are we good?
[490.84s -> 498.57s]  Oh yeah. On second glance, it sucks. You were just looking for the go ahead for me to make
[498.57s -> 517.21s]  fun of it. I get it. I respect that. What do I got for, I got two big cannons, right? I got it.
[518.09s -> 527.59s]  He's not paying attention. It's four buttons in a dodge. I'll be fine. Oh, okay.
[546.86s -> 554.49s]  I got it. Can you make more clay creatures? I want hobby updates.
[555.21s -> 561.90s]  I actually haven't really. I really haven't. I've been kind of busy though. I'll get back
[561.90s -> 570.17s]  into it. I will. All right. I got two cannons. I got the quad missile launchers on both shoulders.
[570.17s -> 579.74s]  I think I'm good. Let's just go. He's going to remember the dash. It's a X, right?
[586.79s -> 597.08s]  You need to try crocheting. The problem with me with crocheting is I agree with you. I would sit
[597.08s -> 601.00s]  down. I'd have on my thread. Like, okay, let's get started. I'm going to take the green and the
[601.00s -> 604.52s]  blue and I'm going to start to crochet. I guess I'm going to stand up and fucking walk in a circle
[605.96s -> 610.36s]  and then I'm going to go get like a water and then pace for five minutes and then sit back down.
[611.88s -> 624.22s]  I can't, I can't do it. All right, here we go. Destroy the city. Gatling cannon. I got it easy
[625.98s -> 633.67s]  up there. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. That's right. We're like a corporation. Oh, that hurt.
[634.31s -> 649.61s]  Can I reach up there? What's a heel? All right. I gotta remember the buttons. It's been a while.
[650.17s -> 660.63s]  How do you turn boost off? What's that? Okay. All right. All right. Now B is boost, right? Okay. Yep.
[661.86s -> 673.56s]  Left stick is that. All right. I got to get up there. All right. Who else is shooting over here?
[673.56s -> 689.80s]  You? I need full boost for this. What about Baldur's Gate three? I actually just barely
[689.80s -> 694.44s]  started to hold on. I can't talk right now. I actually just barely started to care about
[694.44s -> 714.87s]  Baldur's Gate three. Oh my God. What is even shooting at me? Oh, all right. Cannon's down.
[722.06s -> 735.14s]  What's left up here? Destroy the city. Gatling cannon and tetrapod MT. Where is that shit?
[735.86s -> 747.43s]  Not up top, right? Bro is never going to play Hylix two. Yes, I am. I promise at some point,
[748.07s -> 766.71s]  I mean, those things are weak. I just have to kill them. You also promised paper Mario. Yeah,
[766.71s -> 777.21s]  but for my 40th birthday, I got plenty of time. Oh, here we go. This thing. Oh,
[779.34s -> 783.18s]  I can't just sit there and stare at it. Okay. I get it. I get it. I get it. I'm going to be all
[783.18s -> 790.10s]  right. All right. I'm dead. All right. I get it. I get it. I get it. All right. I haven't played
[790.10s -> 801.26s]  this game in like two weeks. The last time you saw me play this game was the last time I had
[801.26s -> 809.53s]  the controller in my hand. All right. It's all these fucking dickheads right here.
[817.34s -> 834.60s]  What was that? What just happened? It's got to keep moving. That's all it is. Keep moving. Keep
[834.60s -> 841.30s]  moving. Keep moving. Keep moving. Come on. Come on. Come on. All right. Uh, maybe I shouldn't
[841.30s -> 860.25s]  have the weapon where you have to stand still to use it. That's probably a bad idea. Yeah. The
[860.25s -> 863.69s]  two weapons I have on left trigger and right trigger, I have to stand still for two seconds
[863.69s -> 881.51s]  to use them. Bad idea. See? All right. That's better than what I did last time. We're good.
[883.61s -> 897.75s]  All right. Land already. There you go. There you go. All right. Here we go.
[897.75s -> 916.63s]  Shit. Okay. Damn. All right. Should I just go right for the guy and not like the 50 people on
[916.63s -> 923.10s]  the wall shooting me? Or should I try to clear everything first? Because there's a million
[923.10s -> 954.46s]  people on this wall. I'm playing it wrong. Oh, shit. Shit. This game is really hard.
[959.13s -> 978.47s]  All right. I'm doing this because these things stink here. Should I buy something new?
[978.47s -> 993.58s]  Just machine guns, probably? I'm going to try the machine guns. That's going to work, right?
[1000.86s -> 1008.04s]  Did that go through? All right. It did. This should be a little bit better.
[1024.28s -> 1030.57s]  Use the melee weapons. The melee weapons are fun. All right. I'm going to take this really slow.
[1031.29s -> 1046.63s]  That's a bad idea. Okay. So I should never be in the air or not in the air, but should always
[1046.63s -> 1057.93s]  be moving as fast as I can. Oh my God. All right. It's only this group right in front of the bridge,
[1057.93s -> 1072.84s]  right? There's people everywhere. I'm just going to clear everything wicked slow.
[1073.16s -> 1084.95s]  Activating combat mode. Do the frontal assault. I'm almost afraid to boot. I lose all my boost
[1084.95s -> 1100.65s]  before I even get over here. I'm going this way. I wish I could just snipe this guy up here. This
[1100.65s -> 1116.54s]  guy's ruining everything. What? This guy got homing shit on his bullshit. That's the boss?
[1116.54s -> 1136.17s]  Oh, well, that's why he's so annoying. Okay. I got a hit. All right. Where's this other guy?
[1136.17s -> 1168.22s]  All right. He's dead. What chassis has the most boost? Oh my God. I can't kill this thing.
[1178.62s -> 1182.94s]  Okay. So here are the 50 things on the wall. How do I fight this guy one-on-one?
[1183.66s -> 1194.49s]  Do I just don't? Just ignore these things? I feel like it's kind of hard to. Look at this.
[1195.29s -> 1217.05s]  Destroy them all. I guess I could just kind of fly up there. Ow. No, no, no. I have no healing.
[1217.69s -> 1244.55s]  All right. That was a little bit better. I want different items. I don't like these.
[1244.55s -> 1268.41s]  Nice bit, right? Okay. What, what is going on here? What is this thing? This is kind of good.
[1268.41s -> 1276.65s]  I want something that takes down the, what is it called? The shield? Maybe the big,
[1276.65s -> 1284.90s]  the big guns. I have to stand still though. And I get hit too quickly. Maybe I should get the
[1284.90s -> 1294.02s]  shield thing. I feel like when I jump up, I just see like, like 10 lasers just go right on top of
[1294.02s -> 1308.58s]  me. Maybe I could just block them. This is the back. What does this thing do? Laser cannon on
[1308.58s -> 1319.61s]  the back. Ooh, that's cool. Dual missiles. That's good. That takes a long time though.
[1319.61s -> 1332.71s]  That takes a long time too. It looks good. That's like an AOE. I kind of want to try this. This is
[1332.71s -> 1343.18s]  expensive, but I want it. Vertical missiles are OP. Verts are OP. Okay. It takes a long time to
[1343.18s -> 1347.38s]  reload, but I feel like I'm just going to be, I'm going to be a coward. Okay, here we go. Combine
[1347.38s -> 1365.83s]  it. Let me put it on. It does way more damage too. What about the, what should I get for the other
[1365.83s -> 1381.77s]  side? Can you doi doi doi? Yeah, for old time's sake. Sure. You know, remember, remember the good
[1381.77s -> 1388.70s]  old days. Use the sword. I actually agree with that. I genuinely agree with that. I love that
[1388.70s -> 1397.88s]  sword. It was very good. But what do I want on the right side? Something, something better.
[1397.88s -> 1417.46s]  Something a little flashier. What's this? Ooh, I want this. All right. This might be a terrible
[1417.46s -> 1439.37s]  design, but who cares? Shotgun? Shotgun, blade, little missiles, big missiles. I think it's all
[1439.37s -> 1453.53s]  right. Go in with no weapons. Just go in and use punch with my hands. I think I'm all right with
[1453.53s -> 1460.55s]  this. All right. It's time to try. Those were all just, I was just doing those too. All right. This
[1460.55s -> 1469.75s]  is the real one. This is the real one. This one's for real. This is going to shred. All right. This
[1469.75s -> 1492.71s]  is, I did my warmup. Here we go. All right. Check it out. Just, just go. Get out of here.
[1494.07s -> 1505.94s]  Get out of here. Where's the other? All right. What was shooting from behind? You see that?
[1506.58s -> 1515.10s]  It gave me an indicator that something was, what, what, what is shooting at me? There's people down
[1515.10s -> 1531.43s]  here. Okay. I'm just testing it out. All right. That's a shotgun. All right. I'm just going to
[1531.43s -> 1539.74s]  clear shit. Okay. All right. Everything here's down here's dead. It's not, it's not a race.
[1539.74s -> 1553.75s]  It's not a race. God damn it. Why do I feel like I have no boost? Do I have like a shit chassis on?
[1554.47s -> 1594.26s]  Okay. Let's go. I'm wrapping around this way. All right. That's good. All right. Good. Come on
[1594.26s -> 1611.29s]  target. It's dead. Where are they going? All right. All right. That one's dead. Fuck you.
[1612.70s -> 1621.42s]  Oh my God. This is correct. Oh my God. This is correct. I figured it out. This is correct.
[1622.14s -> 1649.45s]  Oh, this is correct. Let's get rid of these. Okay. Why do you have a Christmas laugh? That was just
[1649.45s -> 1659.53s]  like a comedy laugh. That's not how I actually laugh. No guys. When I'm watching like the latest
[1659.53s -> 1666.50s]  Will Ferrell movie, I don't go. That's just like a, Ooh, I'm excited because I'm doing something
[1667.14s -> 1679.75s]  fun right now. That's not, that's not how I laugh at jokes. Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh,
[1692.01s -> 1708.26s]  fuck off. Kill this motherfucker. Get him. Get him. Get him. Get him. Get him.
[1710.94s -> 1724.14s]  Oh my God. I'm out of bullets. Where's my boost? Got him.
[1734.02s -> 1747.61s]  Okay. All right. Don't, I'm not going to fuck this up. I'm gonna take it really slow. Dead.
[1747.61s -> 1763.29s]  Okay. I'm going to take it very slow. All right. Now I take these out. We're good.
[1764.01s -> 1768.58s]  Use the jump pads. Oh, I forget what they look like. What do they look like?
[1784.14s -> 1795.02s]  All right. Here we go. Shoot somebody. What are you doing? I was trying to lock on to everybody.
[1803.18s -> 1806.62s]  All right. We're good. All right. I, I beat the mission. I did it.
[1807.34s -> 1834.09s]  Still one more. Oh, right here. Okay. Break in up there. Launching missile at target.
[1840.54s -> 1858.54s]  Let's go. I did it. That is fresh. Oh, be prepared for close quarters combat.
[1859.26s -> 1865.78s]  The deals. Oh, those went through. All right. I got it. I got it.
[1873.85s -> 1887.85s]  Who's talking. All right. This is, this is more of my speed here.
[1902.36s -> 1941.50s]  All right. And scanning. What type of pie should I bake? Um, a pumpkin. Get over. Oh yes. Pumpkin
[1941.50s -> 1948.14s]  pie. The best. Um, pumpkin pie is good. I don't know if I'd say pumpkin pie is the best though.
[1951.38s -> 1959.08s]  Pumpkin pie is, I used to hate it, but now I genuinely love it. I love one piece of pumpkin
[1959.08s -> 1969.74s]  pie. No more than one. No more than one piece of pumpkin pie. That's overdoing it. Is there
[1969.74s -> 1984.65s]  a boss up here that I have to, would you ever do infomercials? Oh, a hundred percent. Yeah.
[1985.21s -> 1986.79s]  I was thinking about doing that recently.
[1995.34s -> 1998.30s]  A supply Sherpa. Oh, is this going to give me full heels again?
[1999.02s -> 2015.43s]  That sounds pretty great. Have you seen Evangelion? I have not. I've seen pieces of it.
[2015.99s -> 2024.25s]  I've seen the final scene. I've seen the last sequence of that show. All right, here we go.
[2024.25s -> 2032.39s]  Uh, do I have a checkpoint here or do I get to really lock it in? I'm going to really,
[2032.39s -> 2055.74s]  I'm going to lock it in. Great. Oh, I thought you guys were all calling me rusty at the game
[2055.74s -> 2067.37s]  because I haven't played it in a while. This is what you're talking about. All right, let's do it.
[2079.05s -> 2095.19s]  Got it. Blind spot like right here. Oops. Get right up in there with the shotgun,
[2095.19s -> 2124.01s]  right in the guts. Stay right there. Get them, get them, attack, attack, attack, attack, attack.
[2137.56s -> 2149.83s]  Hey, hey, hey, what? Why did that not hurt? I know. I don't think I know how much shit I have left.
[2154.42s -> 2173.13s]  The air conditioner's blowing all my hair in my face. My hair is all over my, it's in my mouth
[2173.13s -> 2208.71s]  and shit right now. I swear to God. I need boost right now. I did it first try. I win. I win. I did
[2208.71s -> 2216.50s]  it first try. I win the ultimate game of, uh, can you play Armored Core 6 and you're a live streamer
[2216.50s -> 2240.87s]  and you sit here and play these games and you suck at the ball. I win. Rude? No, I'm saying,
[2240.87s -> 2245.96s]  I'm pretending to be you guys. Streamer can't do it. He sucks at everything. There's no way,
[2245.96s -> 2258.54s]  but I won. I did it. I was being you. Next boss. He's quitting. I'm calling it. I'm going to be
[2258.54s -> 2271.59s]  the next boss just because you're here. First try. I'm not going to say first try, but I'm going to
[2271.59s -> 2299.24s]  do it. You got stuck on the easy part of that mission. That's how it is though. It's like that.
[2304.66s -> 2309.43s]  Bro, you're going to get filtered like water on the next boss. You know, you've been,
[2309.43s -> 2315.82s]  you guys have been saying that this is the third boss now. At what point have you put me through
[2315.82s -> 2325.35s]  the water filter enough times where I am just, I'm just pure water. Like I'm going through the
[2325.35s -> 2333.74s]  filter. Sorry. Uh, there's new stuff. I have a lot of money too. I don't know what this is,
[2333.74s -> 2339.34s]  but I want it. Yeah. You trying to tell me I'm not going to buy this right now. I don't care
[2339.34s -> 2363.50s]  how bad it is. I like this too. New blade. I like that too. What about this thing? New training.
[2363.50s -> 2378.94s]  Yeah. I'll do the training. You get a parts for it, right? Ooh, go only melee build. I feel like
[2378.94s -> 2382.94s]  I've done the best with the melee because melee is just like, I kind of just don't even care.
[2382.94s -> 2387.90s]  I'm just going to go in and just swing. If I die, I die. That's kind of how I'm looking at it.
[2387.90s -> 2394.10s]  The next boss is the one. Apparently people have broken their controllers over.
[2394.10s -> 2398.09s]  Really? Okay. I have to get in the right mindset because I don't, I'm not going to like get mad.
[2399.35s -> 2404.10s]  I'm not, I, I'm not getting mad. This is going to be a, I'm just going to hang out and play
[2404.10s -> 2410.74s]  games today. It's not, I'm not going to put any bite marks into this. Um, whatever, whatever.
[2410.74s -> 2415.14s]  If I lose, I lose. And if I lose 10 times in a row, I lose 10 times in a row. I'm accepting
[2415.14s -> 2426.17s]  that right now. I'm not going to get angry. Okay. We're good. Just a little nibble.
[2426.57s -> 2440.47s]  Okay. Like I, well, who am I kidding? And I go like six bucks as he gets angry. All right,
[2440.47s -> 2446.50s]  let's do it. You want to do a poll? Mods do a poll. Um, do you know what? Do a channel point
[2446.50s -> 2454.28s]  poll. Let's do it. Let's, let's go all in here. Uh, will I show genuine anger at this next boss?
[2454.28s -> 2458.70s]  Like, will I, but what does that mean? We have to get some ground rules here.
[2458.70s -> 2463.03s]  Are we talking like, can I raise my voice? Can I say this is stupid?
[2463.51s -> 2477.38s]  What am I allowed to do? What's the condition? You, I think complaining is fine. Any negativity
[2477.38s -> 2486.42s]  at all. Kind of like Virgil, like the, like the Virgil rules. Okay. No complaint. But can I ask,
[2486.42s -> 2491.26s]  but here's the thing. Can I ask questions? Can I be like, I don't understand. Like,
[2491.26s -> 2495.50s]  why am I getting hit by that? Right. Like, that's a question. As long as I put a question mark at
[2495.50s -> 2502.10s]  the end of anything, I'm going to be fine. Fuck this stupid boss. Right. That's me asking a
[2502.10s -> 2510.79s]  question. This guy's such a piece of shit. Fuck you. These are all questions I'm asking. I'm not,
[2510.79s -> 2518.25s]  I'm not getting angry. I'm asking a question. I think that's okay. You lost the last time you
[2518.25s -> 2529.61s]  did this. I know. All right. Um, let me just do the training. Loophole Larry. He's already cheating.
[2533.24s -> 2542.81s]  People think I'm going to, are we just going to move to coin game in like 30 minutes? Is that
[2542.81s -> 2548.66s]  what you guys think is going to happen? Okay. Well, whatever. Let's see what happens. All right.
[2548.66s -> 2563.27s]  Range weapons to both hands. The double trigger. Um, you hold them both. Oh,
[2567.10s -> 2580.22s]  I've actually been looking for that. Yeah. This, this game is stupid. This game sucks.
[2580.94s -> 2595.35s]  I'm asking if you guys think this, I'm not saying it. Uh, I already knew that. Oh, right. I forgot
[2595.35s -> 2600.87s]  you could that. All right. I have to apologize to everybody watching. Um, I forgot that right stick
[2600.87s -> 2617.27s]  was lock on and I'd haven't locked down to a single enemy in 40 minutes. I forgot. Okay.
[2617.27s -> 2621.59s]  Generator installed to your AC greatly influenced the rest of your assembly from the selection of
[2621.59s -> 2628.97s]  usable parts to the basic performance of the AC, right? A generator that prioritizes EN capacity,
[2628.97s -> 2632.81s]  extensive use of aerial maneuvers. Okay. How do I get this one? I want this one.
[2632.81s -> 2654.22s]  I like the extended use. You have it right now, but is it on my actual character? Okay.
[2654.22s -> 2659.72s]  Fire control system installed X target tracking at close, medium, long range and missile lock
[2659.72s -> 2664.74s]  on multiple. Okay. Specialized for close range combat, allowing it to rely on land attacks with
[2664.74s -> 2671.46s]  its high firepower. Um, okay. So just saying like, go, don't fight things that this thing is a short
[2671.46s -> 2688.34s]  range. Like I completely missed that one, right? So that one is more medium short range. Oh, it is
[2689.06s -> 2708.79s]  nice Ahmed. Cool. Weapons and selection of parts used to assemble an AC determinants,
[2708.79s -> 2735.32s]  ideal combat range in style. Yeah. I didn't, we already know this. I do unlock stuff for doing
[2735.32s -> 2743.88s]  this though. So it's worth doing. You're reading the tutorial message. Like you were explaining it
[2743.88s -> 2753.34s]  to a kindergarten class. Have you watched mob psycho? Like you said, you would know.
[2753.34s -> 2768.44s]  I haven't seen the Smurfs movie either. What is that new generator? Uh, let me do all these.
[2768.44s -> 2782.42s]  Cause it's just going to unlock stuff. So just get them all out of the way. Reverse joint parts.
[2782.42s -> 2804.94s]  Yeah. Ooh. Okay. This is like a, this is like a hopper. You're like hop with this one.
[2805.58s -> 2831.18s]  This one's actually pretty good. I feel like I would love this one. Okay. Is mob psycho any good?
[2831.18s -> 2843.10s]  Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. No sucks. This is going to be one of you. Yep. Three different types of
[2843.10s -> 2852.18s]  weapon category, kinetic, explosive, and energy. So they do different things. They do very different
[2852.18s -> 2864.20s]  things. Cool. Look at that. I'm going to go like that. I'm going to go like that. Let's go ahead
[2864.20s -> 2873.37s]  and get, can bounce, produce heat when fired. When overheated, the weapon will be temporarily
[2873.37s -> 2897.29s]  disabled, right? Okay. So just don't overheat it. What is the overheat meter? Whatever those missiles
[2897.29s -> 2910.47s]  are on my right shoulder are awesome. Okay. That's I can tell now. Ricocheting will occur
[2910.47s -> 2915.59s]  when enemies have high defense, significantly reducing the damage they take. To counteract this,
[2915.59s -> 2919.91s]  try attacking at a closer range or switch to explosive weapons. I've been playing a lot of
[2919.91s -> 2971.24s]  sorcery. I read things like I'm narrating a story. And charge. Okay. You excited for the
[2971.32s -> 2981.78s]  Five Nights at Freddy's movie? No, not at all. I'm just being honest. Ooh, laser handgun.
[2988.52s -> 2995.86s]  There's two more. I'm going to unlock everything. I love upgrades. I love unlockables. I love
[2995.86s -> 3006.84s]  upgradables. Okay. Tetrapod leg units have high loading capacity and enable AC builds
[3006.84s -> 3014.28s]  equipped with multiple heavy weapons. Okay. They can switch to hover mode after, Oh, I have legs
[3014.28s -> 3040.38s]  now. Weird. Okay. I think I found the thing I like. How do I get this? Cause this is all I want.
[3041.82s -> 3051.21s]  I just want the, I want the floating machine. It's recoil. Yep. There's grenade launchers.
[3055.56s -> 3060.28s]  They absorb this kind of recoil, allowing these techs to be with their, Ooh, I can go back to my
[3061.00s -> 3097.34s]  missile launcher now. Ooh, I will abuse this though. I think unfortunately you can stay up a
[3097.34s -> 3119.75s]  pretty long time too. That's actually great. There's still the dash though. That's fine. Okay.
[3119.75s -> 3127.85s]  I definitely think these are my favorites so far. And hover mode allows you to maintain a high
[3127.85s -> 3132.49s]  altitude and turning in turn, making it easier to establish a line of fire and log on without
[3132.49s -> 3143.78s]  geographical obstruction. Yes. A hundred percent. This thing is great. It didn't go up even higher
[3143.78s -> 3175.32s]  too. Ooh, cool. Do the multi-lock with the shoulder. A new grenade launcher. All right.
[3175.32s -> 3193.02s]  What else? One more is tank ACs as well. It might be this one. I don't know. Heavily armored and
[3193.02s -> 3198.44s]  boast excellent loading capacity. In addition to lending themselves to highly durable bills,
[3198.44s -> 3202.68s]  they're also good candidates for high firepower assemblies. Tank type ACs are capable of,
[3202.68s -> 3212.87s]  yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. All right. So it's just good. It just works well, I think. Oh yeah. This
[3212.87s -> 3233.37s]  is the one. I'm just playing Twisted Metal now. Those that know, they know. Those that know,
[3233.37s -> 3244.46s]  they know. And it was a great impression. You can drift. To execute a drift, move left stick
[3244.46s -> 3261.06s]  in the direction you want to face immediately after a boost. Hold on a sec. I'm boosting now.
[3264.38s -> 3315.02s]  Oh, okay. So it has to be like, like that. I mean, it's okay. I get it. Let's go. He hates this.
[3315.90s -> 3322.78s]  No, I, okay. I prefer the other one, but I do. I like this one. This one's fine.
[3340.66s -> 3354.30s]  This one's all right. This one's okay. Lock on. That's right. I forget it exists.
[3357.02s -> 3366.31s]  New vertical. Oh, wait. There's a new training. I'm going to do it. Advanced mercenary
[3366.31s -> 3381.94s]  certification. Adaptive assemblies. During real missions, you can expect enemy reinforcements
[3381.94s -> 3390.30s]  and other changes, right? Of course. Adjust to a wide range of combat scenarios. Sure.
[3390.30s -> 3402.76s]  Hold down right trigger and just fly. Is that not what I was supposed to do? Oh, I'm using my
[3402.76s -> 3412.15s]  regular loadout for a second. I forgot. I thought I had the other stuff on. Helps to remember what
[3412.15s -> 3477.72s]  I had on. All right. Now here comes a tetrapod. Ah, fuck. I forgot. Oh shit. Did it work? Okay,
[3477.72s -> 3542.34s]  cool. Shit. I didn't want to do that. Get over here. Ah, yes. Use lock on. I just did. Hey,
[3542.34s -> 3554.01s]  relax. Relax. Quiet. Congratulations. You have proven your skills by completing the entire
[3554.01s -> 3562.68s]  combat training regimen. Registration number RB23. Call sign Raven. All mind anticipates
[3563.08s -> 3569.69s]  excellent. Don't lock on. It reduces your accuracy. You guys should figure this out amongst
[3569.69s -> 3582.42s]  yourself. I'm getting mixed information in the chat room. Okay. Where's the one where I can't
[3582.42s -> 3598.46s]  be mad? Wait, does this go for the whole time I'm playing? Okay. So I'm allowed to be angry right
[3598.46s -> 3612.82s]  now, right? Okay, good. I got to get it out of my system then. Okay. What did I get? New stuff.
[3612.82s -> 3620.14s]  I want to try the bubble gun. I feel like I'm playing Mega Man. I got the new Mega Man power.
[3620.14s -> 3632.65s]  I want to use it. All right. I need help. Can I have some help? I want to ask another question.
[3632.65s -> 3647.32s]  Can I ask a question? So this is damage. This is the Sekiro bar. This is the, uh, what's this one?
[3647.32s -> 3661.99s]  That's the sustained Sekiro bar. And this is when, this is my overheat meter, which is pretty
[3661.99s -> 3671.40s]  high right now. So of the really important shit. Okay. Attack, power, impact, and ammo.
[3673.16s -> 3678.33s]  Those are the main important ones. There are no weapons that I have that overheat right now. Okay.
[3678.33s -> 3689.85s]  That's good. So realistically it's just damage, Sekiro bar, ammo, how heavy you are, and how much
[3689.85s -> 3695.19s]  boost you can use. That's what EN load is, right? Or do I have that backwards? Wait, no, no, no.
[3695.19s -> 3708.94s]  Okay. Boost speed, EN load, weight. EN is how much capacity you have. The weight limit for weapon
[3708.94s -> 3725.96s]  energy. Okay. Which one of these is boost? Attitude? Stability? Okay. So this is essentially
[3725.96s -> 3737.56s]  Sekiro bar defense. Boost is under boosters. Okay. I just want to make sure I know what I'm
[3737.56s -> 3746.17s]  doing here. All right. What about on this arm? What about the different laser blades?
[3746.17s -> 3762.50s]  This thing seems like it does way more damage. Oh, it only swings once, but I think I like it
[3762.50s -> 3779.80s]  better. All right. EN shortfall. What's that mean? That means I'm too heavy? Not enough energy.
[3779.80s -> 3801.02s]  This one's only four. That's one of the new ones I got, right? Get a better generator.
[3801.02s -> 3811.48s]  Oh, that's right. We have arms and legs. All right. Booster generator. How much money do I have?
[3811.48s -> 3824.60s]  This one's better. This one weighs more. Okay. This isn't the shop. I know. I know. I know.
[3824.60s -> 3836.22s]  I'm just trying to internalize a lot of this. Look at the thrust on this one. The upward
[3836.22s -> 3859.86s]  thrust is terrible though. Should I try it? Close range assist. Help. My hand is up in the air. I'm
[3859.86s -> 3869.69s]  waiting to be called on. What does this mean? Aiming assistance performance at close range.
[3869.69s -> 3877.24s]  Higher values improve aim when targeting enemies at close range. All right. So this is, I lose long
[3877.24s -> 3887.50s]  range assist. Do I care though? I'll try it. I'll use this other generator. I'll put that on,
[3887.50s -> 3903.40s]  whatever. This game is so customizable. How much money do I have? Look at all this stuff.
[3911.48s -> 3921.75s]  Medium range assist. I actually might want that. You can sell stuff you're not using.
[3922.55s -> 3930.86s]  Yeah, that's true. But let me just stumble. Let me just not look into that at all. Stumble through
[3930.86s -> 3939.26s]  the next few missions. Complain about the game. Not do any research on the chassis at all. Say
[3939.26s -> 3946.44s]  that the game is bad and that I don't want to play anymore. I think that's probably a good idea.
[3952.82s -> 3963.54s]  Let's go. That's the way. This is the way. This is the way. I've done that shit before many times.
[3966.14s -> 3977.38s]  I think I'm happy with what I got. It's going to be easy. You're too self-aware. Maybe.
[3988.98s -> 4005.91s]  These are baby missions. Why does your robot look so stupid? Hey, relax. Hey,
[4006.71s -> 4013.90s]  relax. I've said that a few times today. Hey, relax. All right.
[4020.73s -> 4034.84s]  Are you going to do a nun cosplay? No. Why? Why would I do? Well, I mean, I guess I could do
[4035.80s -> 4040.20s]  nun cosplay for the release of that new movie. The new horror movie.
[4040.60s -> 4051.26s]  The Nun 2 in theaters this Friday. I have no idea when that movie comes out.
[4058.46s -> 4081.06s]  Is that a real movie? Yeah. He's going to be a vampire for Halloween. Yeah,
[4081.06s -> 4095.72s]  we already discussed that. I only got four minutes. Did I just friendly fire kill that person?
[4096.20s -> 4107.19s]  4621. All right. Got one. I'll analyze it. Oh, cool. All right. More. This gives us some more
[4107.19s -> 4129.99s]  insight about V4 skills. Oh, it takes a long time to load that one. I like the bubble gun a lot.
[4130.71s -> 4150.38s]  I think it's fantastic. Okay. Some more evidence of a V4 situation. All right. Any more? I just
[4150.38s -> 4174.04s]  need to find a couple more, right? Not down here. There's one over here. Ow. All right. Give me,
[4174.04s -> 4185.66s]  give me, give me. Where are you? Cut it out. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, cut the crap. Okay.
[4185.66s -> 4210.14s]  Hey, cut the crap. Did I not get it? Oh, right. Somebody said you are so cringed.
[4213.00s -> 4237.40s]  Do I apologize? Do I have to say sorry? Hey, cut the crap. All right. There's one here.
[4239.94s -> 4256.44s]  You're a corn ball. Um, yeah, I mean, whatever, whatever. Oh, I can't go that way.
[4261.56s -> 4294.42s]  Got it. Bubble gun is the best gun in the game. Okay. So is it more? I think I got everything.
[4294.42s -> 4328.66s]  Didn't I? Did I knock everything? There's more in the hole. Uh, go into the pit. I didn't even
[4328.66s -> 4339.48s]  know you could go down. Where's the other one? Where's the other one? Where's the other one?
[4339.48s -> 4341.93s]  Where's the other one? Where's the other one? Where's the other one? Where's the other one?
[4341.93s -> 4348.95s]  Where's the other one? Where's the other one? There's two, there's two. Did I do it? Oh,
[4348.95s -> 4366.55s]  I did it. I got it. Okay. I thought I had to get them all. Two more optional ones. Um,
[4366.55s -> 4379.80s]  yeah, that was cool. I like how this is a snow level. Yeah, me too. What do we got?
[4390.58s -> 4391.30s]  Filter incoming.
[4391.30s -> 4408.94s]  I wanted to take one hit from the boss and just talk about how like bad the game is,
[4411.13s -> 4418.68s]  but I can't do that. I have to be real. People bet channel points on this. I have to be,
[4418.68s -> 4431.45s]  I gotta take it seriously. More upgrades. What was the, um, the ratio?
[4436.09s -> 4439.93s]  Was it like two to one, three to one, four to one for I'm going to get mad to not get mad.
[4442.09s -> 4447.61s]  It was four to one, four to one to get mad or four to one. Oh, it's been refunded. Okay. I see.
[4448.25s -> 4458.44s]  We'll do it when we get up there. I see. Yeah. I can now do OS tuning and arena by OS upgrades,
[4461.40s -> 4466.28s]  expend OST chips in your possession to upgrade your ACS OS from the OS tuning menu.
[4467.59s -> 4485.70s]  Really? Wait, control, quick turn. Oh, boost kick weapon bay. Wait, which one of these is,
[4486.73s -> 4491.34s]  uh, would you guys say is very important? Probably this one.
[4493.06s -> 4500.23s]  Boost kick. Oh, I don't have enough to do it. So that's cool. I'm imagining this is, uh,
[4501.11s -> 4512.71s]  PVP probably is multiplayer or something like virtual battles against copies of ACS created
[4512.71s -> 4519.42s]  using all minds, mercenary craft data from the arena menu. Well, this is how you get chips
[4520.06s -> 4533.72s]  invincible. Okay. It's one V one. So do you just go against people's creations? Is that how it
[4533.72s -> 4549.48s]  works? That's kind of cool. No. Yeah. Sort of do all those a lot of content in this game.
[4550.30s -> 4579.91s]  Let me do this mission first. Those are dev creations. This level, this level,
[4600.65s -> 4604.33s]  you buy the kick. No, I didn't. Didn't have enough.
[4615.37s -> 4623.90s]  This level is easy. You got it. This level is hard, but it's not the filter. Okay. Then let me try
[4628.87s -> 4642.25s]  you excited for the new saw movie. Okay. I saw, I saw spiral and I have to say, I can't. All right.
[4642.25s -> 4649.16s]  Does anybody care if I talk about spiral? Can I pause it? Can I talk about spiral for just one
[4649.16s -> 4656.07s]  second? I don't, I'm not going to spoil the whole movie. I'm just going to tell you essentially,
[4656.07s -> 4659.35s]  can I just talk about it for one? Look, just mute the stream for like a minute.
[4659.35s -> 4668.02s]  I'm going to talk about spiral or the book of saw. Okay. Um, are you ready? I'm going to talk
[4668.02s -> 4674.92s]  about spoilers for this movie. Uh, that movie did not need to be a saw movie. The only reason why
[4674.92s -> 4681.08s]  that's a saw movie is because sometimes people would lean over and go, Oh, just like jigsaw.
[4684.41s -> 4692.30s]  And they had a little bit of a soundtrack. That's that's it. Sometimes I want to say
[4692.30s -> 4696.82s]  probably three times over the course of spiral, somebody leans over and says,
[4698.70s -> 4704.90s]  just like John Kramer, John Kramer did this before like saw. And then they do the,
[4708.66s -> 4717.05s]  well, they explain the whole thing at the end of the movie at it. Like it's just, okay. It's just
[4717.05s -> 4728.38s]  like a saw movie, but it's like a soft like fan movie, by the way, they do say gas in saw too.
[4728.38s -> 4744.90s]  I watched it pretty, I watched it pretty recently. It's a soft type movie, right? But look, I love
[4744.90s -> 4750.18s]  saw. So I was like one of my favorite horror franchises, but you don't say this is a Jason
[4750.18s -> 4756.09s]  like movie. Oh yeah. Oh, Hey, by the way, everybody, all these people at this camp.
[4756.09s -> 4761.69s]  Yeah. All these people got killed just like Jason. You guys ever seen Jason? Like, Oh yeah,
[4761.69s -> 4768.25s]  I have seen Jason. Yeah. Just like Jason. Like do we have to say that in a movie? That's not a Jason
[4768.25s -> 4784.38s]  movie. Yes, you do. It's saw adjacent Friday the 13th. Yeah. But okay. But if Freddy Krueger,
[4784.38s -> 4791.83s]  all right. Freddy Krueger invades your nightmares. It's me, it's me, Fred Krueger. I'm gonna slash
[4791.83s -> 4795.94s]  you in your dreams. Right? Like we've, I've done that. You've seen, you've heard me do it before.
[4795.94s -> 4804.42s]  If there was a movie that came out where it was like Steve Stevenson and he murders you in your
[4804.42s -> 4813.45s]  dreams and he comes for you in your nightmares and he wears a sweatshirt. I mean, I don't,
[4813.45s -> 4822.42s]  it's like, what, just why is Freddy Krueger not in this movie? No, no, no, no, no. Wait.
[4822.42s -> 4826.74s]  Somebody's invading your dreams and killing you in your dreams. Just like Freddy Krueger.
[4830.68s -> 4839.40s]  I'm not in this movie at all. I don't spend one second. Yeah. Freddy Krueger. So yeah,
[4839.40s -> 4848.33s]  I'm looking forward to saw X because I don't know. It's all right. I don't want to talk about
[4848.33s -> 4855.66s]  sauce spoilers for the next. Like, do you guys remember? That's okay. I forgot about this until
[4855.66s -> 4862.73s]  very recently. Number one, I forget that there are 10 saw movies. First of all, after the third saw
[4862.73s -> 4869.38s]  movie, I don't remember a single one of those movies. What happens in soft four, five, six,
[4869.38s -> 4881.64s]  seven, eight, and nine. I don't remember them. They went from saw three to like saw 10.
[4882.70s -> 4889.48s]  The other ones in the middle were just like, ah, I guess we'll like mutilate people in the,
[4889.48s -> 4900.14s]  in the, you know, there's saw it's not saw, but it's saw. And I, I remember I look, I know what
[4900.14s -> 4908.76s]  happens. We're not talking all sauce spoilers. I know that after saw three, yes, it's and then
[4909.08s -> 4916.28s]  mm-hmm. And then it's a mm-hmm. And then that person, mm-hmm. I know, I know the whole thing,
[4916.28s -> 4923.53s]  but it's just funny to me that like, we have 10 of these movies and now we're even making ones
[4923.53s -> 4927.78s]  that are in like the sauce cinematic universe that have nothing to do with saw, but it's just like
[4928.52s -> 4938.92s]  jigsaw like traps. And that that's all that translates to the other movies.
[4938.92s -> 4946.68s]  Anyways, I've said what I wanted to say. That's not accurate. There is something else I wanted
[4946.68s -> 4951.98s]  to say that I had as a drafted tweet that is never going to be tweeted, but I'm going to say it.
[4955.61s -> 4959.29s]  I'm convinced the loud diarrhea I've had over the last few days
[4959.29s -> 4968.30s]  is what's causing all these colitis ads I'm seeing now. That's essentially what I believe.
[4984.18s -> 5005.69s]  Yes, you can unmute the stream. Yeah. And I don't, I don't, I don't have to explain that joke.
[5005.69s -> 5011.18s]  I'm not going to explain that reference. I do that too often. You're going to have to figure
[5011.18s -> 5023.16s]  it out on your own. All right. Where, where are we going here? Mute the stream? No, you guys can
[5023.16s -> 5033.77s]  unmute. We're not talking about saw anymore. Oh man. I can't. No, no, no. We're done. Where am I going?
[5033.77s -> 5044.65s]  They can't hear you. Well, that's too bad. Oh, wait. People were muted when I said that. Well,
[5044.65s -> 5052.78s]  just people, 2000 people just probably clicked the clip button. Like they had like fucking potato
[5052.78s -> 5056.70s]  chip grease all over their hands. And they like freaked out. They grabbed the mouse to go to the
[5056.70s -> 5064.50s]  click, the clip thing as fast as possible. And yes, I'm overgeneralizing that you're all eating
[5076.62s -> 5087.14s]  I know where it is. It's right there. I actually am. Yeah. You know what? Me too. Me too. I got
[5087.14s -> 5105.48s]  to wipe this off. Me too. Okay. I got to stay right near this. Whoa. Okay. I think this is just
[5108.30s -> 5146.02s]  they are where, where I killed it, right? He's actually doing like really well considering.
[5146.02s -> 5151.43s]  I know. I thought he was going to do much worse than this. God. I just love being a germamite.
[5152.31s -> 5187.99s]  Don't you? Yeah. Why'd you do that? There were people in there. Stop. This is going to pop out
[5187.99s -> 5215.72s]  of nowhere, right? You're annoying. Fine. That's fine. I got it.
[5217.16s -> 5234.49s]  Yeah. How are those for tricks? Are you talking to yourself? Yeah. I thought he was going to
[5234.49s -> 5254.02s]  teleport over here. What are the bubbles do? They do damage and they go close enough.
[5266.41s -> 5290.46s]  You're full of noises tonight. Just chilling. Good thing. I've got fucking liquid reflexes.
[5326.15s -> 5359.38s]  Whoa. Where is he? Where are you? Where is this guy? Oh, you're up there. Okay. Shit. I missed.
[5369.72s -> 5425.46s]  You guys are annoying. Like they're annoying. Where'd he go? Okay. Dad, what's wrong?
[5429.14s -> 5448.06s]  Oh, cause I said annoying. I called the video game enemies. Annoying. What is our charger sword?
[5448.62s -> 5461.27s]  Response. Let me check. Let me test it. Oh, that is way better than whatever the hell I was doing.
[5461.91s -> 5476.89s]  How did you not know? Uh, I think it's cause it said it had one swing.
[5476.89s -> 5482.10s]  So I just assumed that there was not a second swing, but if you charge it, you do too.
[5482.42s -> 5555.85s]  Is this a boss fight? I see him. I got it working on it. Oh, fuck off. Ow, ow, ow. I'm dead.
[5556.89s -> 5574.31s]  Okay. Well I get it now. Build might not be great here. Oh, I think I'll be okay.
[5577.91s -> 5578.71s]  All right. Let's go.
[5599.22s -> 5612.09s]  Oh, behind you. All right. So it's three of them. Are there a small, where's the smaller one?
[5612.09s -> 5646.04s]  All right. Four of them. Yep. Oh, come on. Go please. There's one back here.
[5648.23s -> 5656.42s]  Where are you? Where are you? I just saw you before. Where'd you go? Oh, right here. Nope.
[5656.42s -> 5687.24s]  That's the big one. Oh, they are so high up. Oh shit. Okay. Just the big guy, right?
[5690.14s -> 5699.75s]  Nope. There's another one. Where is he? There you are. Okay. Now it's just you.
[5700.55s -> 5721.16s]  Did that not hit? All right. There we go. Much, much better than last time.
[5732.02s -> 5737.88s]  Bubble gun helps a lot. It feels like it's pretty good. You don't have to be super accurate. It's
[5737.88s -> 5756.41s]  just kind of a lot of expenses, but whatever. All right. Have I made it? Is it time? It's time.
[5756.41s -> 5764.60s]  It's actually time. Perhaps. Okay. I got to think of only happy thoughts.
[5768.92s -> 5776.60s]  The lucky charms, marshmallows that turn into different like dragon coins when they hit milk.
[5776.60s -> 5778.36s]  That makes me really happy. I'm good.
[5778.36s -> 5799.82s]  Ah, that kind of hurt. That hurt.
[5807.05s -> 5812.25s]  Aren't you like 40? Yeah, I am. And I'm allowed to make funny little jokes.
[5828.68s -> 5829.48s]  Funny.
[5836.34s -> 5846.01s]  Okay. So I am being pinged by a mod right now. And it's like, dude, go do those arena missions,
[5846.01s -> 5851.37s]  please. Because the upgrades that you get there are going to make your life much easier.
[5854.28s -> 5863.02s]  All right. Let's do this. I don't meet the conditions to fight this person. Why not?
[5863.02s -> 5870.71s]  Oh, it's a ranking system. Oh, okay. All right. Let's go. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it.
[5879.61s -> 5885.19s]  Mod that mod. So these are just 1v1 challenging fights.
[5886.79s -> 5914.84s]  Mad stomp. Okay. Let's do it. Holy shit. You were so easy. I don't, I'm not even gonna,
[5915.40s -> 5954.57s]  you're not even gonna hit me once. Anybody else coming up here to fight? Easy, easy, easy, easy.
[5956.94s -> 5969.78s]  Say that now. Let's do all these. You get the emblems too. That's funny. They're very fun.
[5969.78s -> 5982.23s]  That was really fun. Wait, do I just get 17,500 gold? I can do it as many times as I want.
[5989.82s -> 5998.14s]  Like many other dosers, Rummy is utterly addicted to coral based drugs. And his perpetually addled
[5998.14s -> 6006.78s]  state. He has convinced himself that he is an invincible demigod. Even should reality intervene
[6006.78s -> 6012.36s]  with a costly defeat, he will forget about the setback entirely by the next day. Only death can
[6012.36s -> 6020.87s]  dispel his notions of invincibility. Geez. Okay. Blue collar worker who was involved in the
[6020.87s -> 6026.47s]  construction of the grid. He's now dedicated to establishing symbiosis with the coral and
[6026.47s -> 6034.33s]  building a future for Rubicon free from planetary closure. Inspired by father Dolmean's ideals.
[6036.68s -> 6051.75s]  Kick his ass. Lock on. I locked on. I was locked on almost the whole time. I am locking on. I am
[6051.75s -> 6119.05s]  locking on. Look, I just did it the whole last fight. Look, look. Come here. Aw. Maybe increase
[6119.13s -> 6127.35s]  the camera turn speed. You only need to lock on once. That's true, but if they go out of my line
[6127.35s -> 6141.11s]  of sight, I have to do it again, right? No. What? Wait, no. It just, oh, it just relocks. Okay. I
[6141.11s -> 6149.40s]  didn't know that. That's good to know. Thank you. Appreciate it. Lock on is a mode. Maybe camera
[6149.40s -> 6164.17s]  speed. I'm, I'm okay for right this very moment. I do agree that it could become a problem.
[6164.17s -> 6173.96s]  Locking on makes your aim way worse. Yeah. Seems like there's one mind to do lock on and there's
[6173.96s -> 6179.64s]  one mind to never do lock on. I don't know which one of you are correct, but just do it. I'm just
[6179.64s -> 6192.84s]  going to do it when I think I want to. That's a myth. Are we, okay. Are we in the stage of
[6192.84s -> 6197.00s]  From Software games where nobody really knows what actually is better? I feel like it would,
[6197.00s -> 6202.97s]  it's been a week or two. People should know by now, right? Or a bit. It does usually, usually
[6202.97s -> 6207.21s]  like a month or two. We'll go by her. I think we still need to wait a little longer to figure out
[6207.21s -> 6270.52s]  who's right. Um, I'll keep it on for now. Oh, that hurt a lot. No, no, no, no, no. No. Sorry. I'm
[6270.52s -> 6293.03s]  alive. Oh shit. I got really gritty at the end there. I almost had it. Went for a charged melee.
[6293.11s -> 6382.14s]  Yeah. Don't get hit. Where, where is he? Where does he start? Oops. Oh shit. No, please. There
[6382.14s -> 6412.90s]  we go. I did it. All right. I have a lot of chips now. So what are the good things to do?
[6419.11s -> 6422.55s]  Somebody held their hand up and they were like, Hey, can I, I, can I say something that you didn't
[6422.55s -> 6430.90s]  do in the tutorial? And they just went to the office. They got timed out. Excuse me, teacher.
[6430.90s -> 6452.74s]  I have a question. Go to the office. Oh shit. They did that 20 times. I finally called on that
[6452.74s -> 6476.55s]  student to send you to the office. I got a lot of money. What am I spending it on? Lock on is
[6476.55s -> 6485.51s]  broken. If you move the camera stick, lock on moves the camera for you. Oh, get the legs. Go
[6485.51s -> 6500.92s]  get the legs. That's right. Ooh. Should I do the tank? Nope. We're doing that. What should I sell
[6500.92s -> 6509.35s]  that? I don't care about that. I can just get back later. Do I care about anything on here?
[6509.35s -> 6538.12s]  Okay. Way more health, way more stability. I need more energy. So, Oh, way too much. How
[6538.12s -> 6547.69s]  heavy is the bubble gum? Bubble gun is pretty heavy, but I like it. I'm keeping it on. The
[6547.69s -> 6559.78s]  blade is pretty heavy too, or doesn't use a lot of energy. This one's good. I like this one too.
[6559.78s -> 6578.74s]  Disable one of the shoulders. That does work. I am going into, uh, apparently a really hard,
[6578.74s -> 6587.27s]  really mad inducing boss fight. Basically lock on is a useful at your weapons effective range,
[6587.27s -> 6590.95s]  but if the enemy is too close or too far for your weapon, it will be less effective.
[6591.51s -> 6598.17s]  You could also buy a new generator. Just need generator. It's the most important part.
[6599.32s -> 6609.43s]  Uh, let me go look and see what's even for sale. Okay. I need, I need a big bulky one,
[6609.43s -> 6624.74s]  right? This, this thing is 416. How much is this one? 170 for the middle one. Okay. What should I
[6624.74s -> 6637.62s]  sell? Yeah. I, and I can buy these all back, right? I can buy everything back. I'm not going
[6637.62s -> 6647.26s]  to lose any of these. This is not okay. How much do I need? 170. I want to keep bubble gun and I
[6647.26s -> 6670.02s]  want to keep, um, blade. I like the weapons I have. And now this thing is much more health.
[6670.58s -> 6677.90s]  Generators work by how much they have at full capacity, but also how much they recharge.
[6677.90s -> 6682.06s]  High recharge is going to be important for this boss fight in order to boost to dodge attacks.
[6682.94s -> 6686.22s]  Also, if you want me to, if somebody got banned and you want me to, uh,
[6686.22s -> 6693.02s]  unban them, that's not happening. Swap out the bubble gun. It's bad. Well, let me just see.
[6693.83s -> 6706.68s]  Let me see. I got a bunch of new stuff. Somebody said the chest piece is really important with
[6706.68s -> 6714.98s]  this too. All right. I'm going. Okay. Hold on. Where's my generator? Okay. There it is.
[6714.98s -> 6742.52s]  How was this one better? You don't have any back right equipment on. Is that bad? I'm still in
[6742.52s -> 6753.96s]  range here. No, I won't be. Bro does not get it. I'm, I'm doing fine. I've beat all the, look,
[6753.96s -> 6760.04s]  I might, it might not be perfect. It might not be exactly perfectly handled, but I have beaten
[6760.04s -> 6763.80s]  every mission so far and I'm going to beat this boss and I'm not going to get angry.
[6763.80s -> 6772.41s]  We're just going to go for it. I'm just going to play it. And if I'm, if I can, if I lose,
[6772.41s -> 6779.77s]  I can go back and, you know, re decide what I'm going to use. I'm not going to get angry.
[6779.77s -> 6783.69s]  This is it. Is, uh, are we, are we, do we have the, is the poll ready?
[6784.89s -> 6801.69s]  So I cannot get angry. I cannot complain. I think complaining is makes sense because
[6801.69s -> 6810.63s]  I don't have a face camera and it's not turning on. Don't let people decide your build for you.
[6810.63s -> 6819.69s]  No, I think I'm sticking to my guns here. You're gonna get angry.
[6821.40s -> 6835.93s]  We'll see. Okay, here we go. We kind of need to wait. I want to, so this, this is currently
[6835.93s -> 6844.28s]  8 million channel points saying that I will rage at this boss. I want to set the ground rules again
[6846.79s -> 6855.59s]  going, Oh, or what? Oh my God. That's fine. But me saying, Oh my God, this,
[6856.07s -> 6862.46s]  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, right?
[6862.46s -> 6868.38s]  That has to be fine. Like, Ooh, I got hit by something. Oh, what? Totally.
[6869.18s -> 6873.58s]  Shit. And now I'm going to talk about how stupid this is, right? That's the difference.
[6874.14s -> 6887.45s]  I didn't even buy my chips. That's right. All right. Boost kick. Okay. How do I do that?
[6887.45s -> 6897.16s]  L during assault boost is boost kick. What is this one? Ooh, you can take away the missile
[6897.16s -> 6904.65s]  launchers and put regular weapons there. Weight control unlocks the ability to sortie
[6905.29s -> 6930.39s]  when AC is overburdened. I don't get that manual aiming. Turn more armor. Salt armor is good.
[6935.27s -> 6951.48s]  Second charge of assault armor. Quick turn fire controlled optimizes fire control. Oh,
[6952.12s -> 6963.22s]  don't even don't show these to me. Wait, repair kits. I feel like I should do this.
[6964.73s -> 6974.65s]  Either that or maybe speed dynamic deflection. This is just straight up damage mitigation.
[6974.65s -> 6989.72s]  This is just 3% less damage overall. I'm going to do the heel. I have one more.
[6989.72s -> 6996.92s]  I have people saying quick turn. I'm not going to use it though. All right. What? So I got kick
[6997.64s -> 7007.50s]  quick turn. All right. So it's unlocked. I don't, do I have it installed? Is it installed right now?
[7007.50s -> 7014.02s]  Press L and Y at the same time. You have to equip it. You need to equip it. Okay.
[7016.39s -> 7020.07s]  What does it do? Assault armor creates a pulse explosion centered on the AC.
[7020.63s -> 7023.91s]  Cancelling out incoming enemy fire and creating a damaging area. It's such a big,
[7023.91s -> 7029.35s]  like I just tasted a frozen grape and it was amazing by the way. I just like was in,
[7029.35s -> 7040.06s]  I just tasted one. It was great. Okay. So where is it? Frozen grapes just don't ever leave your
[7040.06s -> 7048.97s]  mind. Once you eat a frozen grape, it's there. It's in the back of your mind forever. It just
[7048.97s -> 7065.40s]  is. I'm telling you, trust me. Um, okay. Expansion. There it is. I think I'm happy
[7065.40s -> 7068.60s]  with this right now. I'm just going to, let me just see what the boss does. I'm not going to
[7068.60s -> 7090.07s]  get angry. We're just going to check it out. Let's go. I'm ready. Stay positive. Somebody
[7090.07s -> 7097.69s]  said, that's why I just talked about grapes. I'm not going to, look, this game is hard.
[7098.25s -> 7104.92s]  It's a very challenging experience. From software made it. This is a boss that they made. It's,
[7104.92s -> 7114.34s]  it's like millennia. We'll get upset. I am do emote only. Okay, fine. Emote only because I
[7114.34s -> 7127.70s]  don't want any help either. I got my bubble gun. I've got my super launcher and I've got my sword.
[7131.56s -> 7134.36s]  I choose this chassis because it looks like
[7143.96s -> 7159.34s]  okay. There are things being fired every direction. This is it. Okay. We're good.
[7162.20s -> 7181.50s]  Ouch. That hurt. Ouch. I'm going to try that again. Okay. Everything is good. We are doing cool.
[7182.62s -> 7198.90s]  One sees you. Who saw that by the way? And you didn't even see that.
[7224.25s -> 7257.27s]  Easy. Hold on. I like floating around like this. This is great. That thing is huge up there.
[7272.98s -> 7297.66s]  Oh, look out. Got it. They said to be patient. Everything is good. We're doing fine. Part two.
[7297.82s -> 7309.94s]  Waiting for combat. You're exposed to snipers from all quarters. Oh my God.
[7315.27s -> 7337.83s]  What's happening right now? I, uh, I'm still alive though. I just have to make it to the boss.
[7338.39s -> 7360.55s]  Okay. That's it. One more. Where are you? Oops. What? I'm on it. I'm out of bullets.
[7371.19s -> 7380.20s]  Good. I'm not bad. I'm going to get a checkpoint here. So I'm fine with this.
[7380.68s -> 7397.85s]  That's the watch points control center. Targets inside. How do I reload weapons? Can you spell
[7397.85s -> 7413.54s]  it out to me in emotes? How do you reload? Okay. It's Y plus the weapon button. Oh,
[7413.54s -> 7419.10s]  this thing can't be reloaded. That's just how much ammo is left total. Thank you. Appreciate
[7419.10s -> 7431.13s]  the help. All right, here we go. Something's going to blow the bridge up while it's running.
[7431.69s -> 7462.42s]  What is that thing? Is it a bubble gun? Oh, I see. You're very smart. You have a bubble gun as well.
[7469.61s -> 7478.33s]  He's an independent mercenary who survives. 621 kills you.
[7495.61s -> 7556.98s]  Where'd he go? I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. He flies around.
[7560.31s -> 7564.79s]  That was sloppy. It's the first time I've ever seen this guy. I'll get him.
[7575.42s -> 7582.14s]  He has bubble gum. Anybody else have this problem when they play games like this?
[7582.86s -> 7588.22s]  I forget what the weapon is on top left sometimes, and I go, wait a minute. I have that.
[7594.62s -> 7599.85s]  No, no, no, no, no. I'm seeing a lot of yeses though. All right, let's go.
[7620.20s -> 7625.56s]  Whoa, whoa. Wait, I can. What's going on? Oh, I can. I thought this was death if I fell in here.
[7631.93s -> 7651.24s]  Shit. I got staggered. Damn it. That's, that's not angry. That's an exclamation.
[7651.24s -> 7665.74s]  That's not angry. We already agreed that we, I could do that. Oh.
[7696.39s -> 7733.66s]  Ah, kind of a little. Hit him with that. Easy, easy, easy. Do not get hit by that.
[7746.07s -> 7768.76s]  Did I do it? Did I beat him? How'd I do? Okay. I feel very happy right now.
[7769.48s -> 7774.20s]  I'm not angry or anything. Things are well, things are going very well.
[7775.46s -> 7790.79s]  I thought that just kills me. That would have been really sad. Okay. Am I going the wrong way?
[7791.77s -> 7799.18s]  Oh, I was reading chat. I thought I did it. I was looking for all the pog champs.
[7801.29s -> 7816.74s]  Wait, can I take like a chip out of this? No. Ah, that was just part one. I see.
[7821.78s -> 7834.78s]  Hmm. He got through part one, but how will he do it? Part two is the scary part is a supply.
[7845.24s -> 7849.00s]  All right, well, let's go. What is it? It's probably a giant snake.
[7879.75s -> 7901.94s]  How do I do that? That was really loud. That was super loud.
[7909.29s -> 7941.08s]  Here comes the real boss. The ground's going to be lava. I probably have to do this level
[7941.08s -> 7943.48s]  in complete darkness, which is why everyone thinks it's hard.
[7963.29s -> 7975.80s]  Wake up. R.T. Thanks R.T. for the raid. Welcome everybody. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome.
[7975.80s -> 7983.74s]  We're playing Armored Core 6. I've not died once, so it's actually pretty interesting.
[7983.74s -> 7992.41s]  Welcome to the gamer zone. Oh, it's emote only. They can't even talk. Well, thank you nonetheless.
[7999.72s -> 8005.37s]  Yeah, it's weird. People are saying, dude, this is so hard. So I've been,
[8005.37s -> 8009.21s]  I've been playing this game with my feet the whole time. Like it's been going pretty well.
[8010.55s -> 8023.14s]  It's kind of hard, I guess, when you play like that. Oh, all right, here we go.
[8061.70s -> 8140.58s]  How could I have missed? Oh, is this thing out of bullets? It's almost empty.
[8141.30s -> 8155.58s]  Okay. So that was interesting. So the big problem is trying to dodge those. I didn't
[8155.58s -> 8162.34s]  know they were homing missiles, but now I do. I know they home and I think you just run them.
[8178.86s -> 8206.73s]  Where are you? I got an, oh, here we go. Here we, here we go.
[8207.53s -> 8237.72s]  Ow. My goodness. That hurts a lot. I didn't get hit by any of that time.
[8267.91s -> 8282.07s]  Whoa. Well, that hurt. What was that move? Question. Okay. 50%. That's not bad.
[8283.53s -> 8286.49s]  Happy Hob with a raid too. Two big raids back to back. Thanks guys.
[8286.49s -> 8298.84s]  Appreciate it. I'm thinking that I'm trying again. Welcome all raiders. I got to get this down.
[8319.77s -> 8323.94s]  Crap. If you get hit once here, it hurts a lot.
[8348.71s -> 8392.50s]  All right. I need shield breakers. This, this ain't cutting it. Ow. Yeah. I need anti-shield
[8392.50s -> 8404.82s]  and I need explosive. Yeah. We're changing it up. Oops. I'm not angry. I'm just a little
[8404.82s -> 8412.34s]  surprised at what just happened. Everything is okay. I'm just a little surprised. Oops.
[8413.30s -> 8421.14s]  I just wanted to get back out here as fast as I could because I wanted to change this stuff
[8421.14s -> 8433.56s]  very quickly. All right. I need anti-shield. I'm good. I'm good. I just was surprised that
[8433.56s -> 8446.71s]  that's what I just did. So what do I need? I need shield impact. There it is, right? All right.
[8446.71s -> 8465.90s]  Impact. Drop that shield. No, I'm seeing a lot of nay. Nay, nay, nay. No, no, no. Don't do this.
[8469.93s -> 8483.56s]  Isn't that what that means? Because people were saying the bubble gun is really good
[8483.56s -> 8488.50s]  against the shields, but I don't use it that effectively. I always burn it out.
[8488.50s -> 8503.80s]  Let me take a look. Hold on. Impact. What has the most impact? Probably some of these.
[8503.80s -> 8519.40s]  There's way too many yays and nays here. I'm just going to do the thing I just did.
[8519.40s -> 8529.24s]  I think that's what I'm going to do. I have to stand still for this, but
[8529.24s -> 8535.80s]  I'll try it. What do I want on the other hand? The sword is really good, though. I love the
[8535.80s -> 8543.14s]  sword of this so much. Grenade launcher, maybe? Let's do grenade, grenade. Okay, this is bazooka
[8543.14s -> 8548.68s]  and this is grenade launcher. What does this one do? Yeah. Yeah, fuck it. We're doing this one too.
[8548.68s -> 8568.73s]  That's what we're going for. It might be dumb, but I'm very surprised at what I just did,
[8569.78s -> 8591.82s]  and that's my own fault. Nobody else's fault but mine. I'm ready. I got two big missile launchers.
[8593.83s -> 8610.10s]  I've got two missile launchers now. Way better. Way better. I mean like a hundred times better.
[8622.30s -> 8661.42s]  Oh, I ran out of juice. Did I miss? Come on, do it. Okay, I do have to fight that.
[8661.42s -> 8662.54s]  I have to fight that guy again, don't I?
[8662.54s -> 8735.62s]  Oh, ow. Die. Got it. Where? Okay, we are good. Fight the boss. Well, the mini boss. Let me get
[8735.62s -> 8751.64s]  it right. I'm going to lose here, right? It's okay to lose here. There's the kick.
[8752.28s -> 8758.94s]  It's the first time I've seen that. All right, let's see. Maybe I can do it first try with half
[8758.94s -> 8807.24s]  health. I almost got it. Damn it. All right, he's a little fast. I wasn't planning on beating him
[8807.24s -> 8830.33s]  this time anyways. I had half health. These things are slow. I just need to get to the
[8830.33s -> 8854.87s]  checkpoint for the boss. All right, three hills. I'm ready. Let's go. All right, I got to get above
[8854.87s -> 8874.97s]  you. You're so quick. Shit, I'm never going to hit this guy. I am never going to hit this guy.
[8875.93s -> 8916.92s]  He's too fast. Shit. One good hit and this guy is dead. All right, we're okay. Come on,
[8916.92s -> 8957.77s]  that didn't hit. I haven't even hurt him. Oh, that was good. Ah, point blank. I'm right in
[8957.77s -> 8972.30s]  the face. Come on. I got him. I got him. I got him. I got him. That hurt a lot.
[8984.58s -> 8990.18s]  He stopped bumping into me. He's bumping into me. He keeps just driving into me.
[8998.92s -> 9016.17s]  No. All right, this is a bad loadout against this guy. It takes too long to shoot this guy
[9016.73s -> 9026.97s]  with this loadout. I can do it. I can do it. I can do it. Look how close I just got it. I'm good.
[9028.73s -> 9032.57s]  Yeah, let him out of emote only. I want to see their anger. I want to feel it.
[9047.13s -> 9055.00s]  I'm just chilling. I'm doing fine. All right, my gun was just in his body.
[9077.45s -> 9088.73s]  Which ones did I kill? I wonder. Somebody said boost kick. Oh, I just tried it.
[9090.14s -> 9118.26s]  Probably does a lot of damage. Where'd he go? Boost kick scales with weight. Oh, shit. Oh,
[9118.26s -> 9127.32s]  the bubble ward. That's a good idea. Somebody shoot somebody at him. I didn't have any bullets
[9127.32s -> 9138.97s]  left. Shit. Okay, this is not going to work. I'm just understanding that right now. Yeah,
[9138.97s -> 9145.51s]  it's way too fast to use these weapons. Okay, so here's what we're going to do. You don't need
[9145.51s -> 9159.19s]  to quit. It's okay. It means I have to do it again. What are the problems? Okay, the problems
[9159.19s -> 9175.75s]  are they're too slow. So I honestly think this was fine. I think the bubble gun was actually doing
[9175.75s -> 9180.87s]  pretty good. I mean, I beat him with the bubble gun. I can't beat him with these two. I'm going
[9180.87s -> 9196.23s]  to keep it on. I need just something to like do double bubble. I think you might be onto something.
[9196.79s -> 9211.32s]  I'm going to try it. I'm going double bubble. Just need to buy the other one, right? Yeah.
[9211.32s -> 9231.96s]  All right, we're going to go double bubble. 90,000. I don't need this. That one's on.
[9232.60s -> 9244.06s]  All right, double bubble. This is fine. This can stay on. All right, what about this stuff?
[9244.06s -> 9253.48s]  I feel like I need to go to like armored core school for three weeks so I can get my doctorate
[9253.48s -> 9273.86s]  in armored core. I'm kind of too heavy. I think this is good. I mean, I kind of have... Wait.
[9284.02s -> 9293.53s]  I mean, this thing that you are so, so much lighter, but obviously all that capacity is
[9293.53s -> 9302.33s]  gone and I want the capacity. Apparently too heavy though. How do I drop some weight?
[9302.33s -> 9311.50s]  Get rid of one of these? No, I have a better idea. I'm changing my entire play style.
[9311.50s -> 9327.11s]  Everything is changing right now. Here's what I'm going to do. We're doing double sword. I'm doing
[9327.11s -> 9338.04s]  sword on left, sword on right, and then big missiles in the back. That's not possible. Oh,
[9338.12s -> 9347.38s]  it can't be done. That can't be done? Okay, well I'm going to do... That can't be done.
[9347.38s -> 9361.40s]  Try to stick with what I know. You know what? I feel like this thing is good. Get the weapon bay.
[9361.40s -> 9378.87s]  I don't have enough. And now I'm going to do this. I'm going to try this. I want to be able to move
[9378.87s -> 9396.98s]  around. Let's try that. I have to start the mission over again. All right, so do not quit
[9396.98s -> 9405.35s]  the mission. Just die, go to continue, and the continue screen has... Stop touching the camera
[9405.35s -> 9412.39s]  stick when locked on. Yeah, but you are talking about 30 years of me tracking with the right
[9412.39s -> 9432.12s]  stick. You're going to take a while to get used to that. See how this is. All right, so now that's
[9432.12s -> 9453.80s]  good. See how this works now. A little bit faster. All right, get rid of that thing. Did I hit it?
[9454.52s -> 9466.22s]  Okay, I forgot what my entire loadout was. I was just shooting as if I had the grenade
[9466.22s -> 9484.02s]  launcher on still. Okay, left trigger is sword. Did I dodge into that? My goodness.
[9489.50s -> 9513.35s]  Right trigger is just regular shoot gun. Left trigger is sword. Okay, that was very sloppy,
[9513.35s -> 9529.99s]  but it's all right. Now fighting this guy will be a lot better. I mean, I'm going to lose,
[9529.99s -> 9599.61s]  but it's fine. All right. Let's go. You're talking like you're reassuring a kid in a storm,
[9599.61s -> 9607.85s]  like those loud sounds. It's thunder. Hey, watch this. Ready? Flash. One, two, three.
[9608.49s -> 9615.53s]  Booger. That means it's four miles away. Feeling? Yeah. After you see the flash,
[9615.53s -> 9622.41s]  count one Mississippi tube, and then you'll figure it out. Lightning's not scary now, is it?
[9635.61s -> 9648.71s]  I mean, I planned on dying here, so it's okay. I want to go in fresh. Just kill me. I wanted to
[9648.71s -> 9654.17s]  get killed right there. I've been playing for three hours. I thought it's been like 40 minutes.
[9657.80s -> 9661.48s]  Time really flies when you hate fucking everything possible about a game and can't
[9661.48s -> 9673.88s]  stand playing it, and you're only playing it for views. Wow. I'm kidding. Stop that. I'm
[9673.88s -> 9700.90s]  kidding. That was very clearly a joke. Here we go. Where am I?
[9706.47s -> 9726.57s]  We're 619 and 620. Dead? Which ones did I kill, I wonder? Double.
[9732.62s -> 9766.41s]  That didn't even hurt him at all. Wow. There we go. All right. Now we're going to fight the real
[9766.41s -> 9797.58s]  boss. Real boss. I'm probably going to die in this one, too. Now we're cooking. There's the
[9797.58s -> 9809.02s]  supply. Don't quit. Don't quit. I won't quit. I won't. I won't. I'll make sure I get it right.
[9809.02s -> 9816.73s]  I know the last time I did that, at least a few of you had a bunch of papers on your desk,
[9816.73s -> 9823.14s]  and you just threw them in the air. I know. You were taking notes on my performance, and it was
[9823.14s -> 9826.50s]  like, all right, he did that like three times. Whatever. Just throw them up in the air.
[9827.06s -> 9863.74s]  All right. Here we go. I'm going to try it with this. Should be good. I did it. You need to
[9863.74s -> 9870.94s]  believe in the lock. Don't touch the right stick. Believe in the lock. I know, but I can't. I'm
[9870.94s -> 9882.36s]  trying. I promise I'm trying. No cam means you can rage in silence. I have actually not. You know,
[9882.36s -> 9889.30s]  you guys talked this up so much. This is like a filter. I don't think you guys should have said
[9889.30s -> 9904.02s]  anything, because I probably would have been like, what's going on here? Now I know this one's a
[9904.02s -> 9927.77s]  hard one. I'm just trying to watch the missiles come in. All right. I'm locked on right now. I'm
[9927.77s -> 9935.02s]  not going to hit any of the right stick or anything. This is going way, way worse than
[9935.02s -> 10019.06s]  last time. Oh, I'm already out of boost. All right. Here come the missiles. Oh, I'm dead.
[10019.06s -> 10040.73s]  Okay. That's 50%. Okay. Stop touching the right stick. That's a large ask. It really is.
[10041.37s -> 10062.01s]  It's almost making it harder for me. I mean, I'm not touching the right stick. It's weird to not
[10062.01s -> 10083.99s]  have my thumb on that though, but I'm going to keep it up. Did that hurt? I think that kind of
[10083.99s -> 10127.05s]  hurt. Ouch. I'm taking so much damage. Sometimes I feel like this game's like a war of attrition
[10127.05s -> 10152.66s]  that I will always lose. Better than last time. Oh, that happens when? Okay. We're at 50% again.
[10161.21s -> 10172.06s]  Different sword. Okay. What do I got in my hand right now? Let's go bubble.
[10172.06s -> 10183.45s]  And then this one's eight. I'll do this one. I'm all right now. All right. Let's go for it. Here
[10183.45s -> 10226.82s]  we go. Oh, okay. Bubble. I was getting better. I didn't want to do that, but it's all right.
[10238.46s -> 10279.80s]  Oh shit. I'm clear. I'm clear. I'm clear. I'm clear. Am I? That hurt. Oh, that was a big move.
[10283.03s -> 10287.11s]  What is this new move? All right. You have a gigantic sword now?
[10288.23s -> 10305.75s]  Flamethrower. Okay. All right. All right. It's not even a big deal. That hurts.
[10306.55s -> 10327.61s]  Come here. Come here. Come here. Okay. So phase two now has a gigantic fire sword. Good to know.
[10330.07s -> 10350.63s]  Okay. Just keep the pressure up. No matter what. Pressure. Only pressure. Pressure. Pressure.
[10350.63s -> 10353.43s]  Only pressure. Only pressure. Pressure. Pressure. Pressure. Pressure. Pressure. Pressure.
[10354.31s -> 10450.38s]  Pressure. What happened? Oh, shoot. I had it. It's okay. We're good. What the heck? I forgot.
[10450.38s -> 10455.56s]  I forgot. I forgot. I forgot. I forgot. I forgot. Oh my god. I'm just driving into it. I forgot
[10455.56s -> 10458.76s]  everything. I forgot everything. It was so clean. That first wave was so clean too. And I forgot
[10458.76s -> 10476.28s]  everything. I was so locked in trying to like fight that I forgot of the other moves. Oh,
[10476.28s -> 10519.75s]  that's fire. I forgot he did those moves. It's okay. It's all right. It's all right. It's all
[10519.75s -> 10522.39s]  right. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. I got it right here. Everyone
[10522.39s -> 10528.82s]  relax. This is it right here. I got it. I got it. It's just phase two happened and I took
[10528.82s -> 10533.82s]  two full health bars in damage because I stood there and went, what is this move?
[10542.47s -> 10558.57s]  That. Hey, easy. Easy. Am I locked on?
[10596.41s -> 10605.02s]  I forgot the moves again. I forgot them again, guys. I'm way too locked in.
[10631.43s -> 10650.60s]  I didn't mean to do that. I forgot the moves again, by the way. Like if I just, honestly,
[10650.60s -> 10685.83s]  I need to go write it on a fucking chalkboard and I'll be fine. Like a thousand times. Hey.
[10687.05s -> 10693.26s]  Oh my goodness. Okay. We're fine. All right. Phase two, the swing happens. Phase two,
[10693.26s -> 10699.34s]  the swing happens. Phase two, the swing happens. Phase two, the swing happens. Don't just keep
[10699.34s -> 10705.32s]  playing like it's going to just be phase one. Don't get locked in phase two. We're good.
[10705.32s -> 10709.80s]  Everything is fine. Everything is just completely good. We're good. Come on. Come on.
[10711.08s -> 10776.38s]  Back up. I couldn't back up. I couldn't back up. I couldn't back up. I was staggered.
[10781.14s -> 10787.94s]  I got it. I, all right. I am so confident that I'm going to beat this, but it's my confidence
[10787.94s -> 10796.94s]  that's causing a huge problem. I have to be not confident anymore. Right? Like I have to be like,
[10796.94s -> 10802.01s]  oh, it's not going to happen. I don't think it's going to happen. All right. I got it this time.
[10802.65s -> 10847.19s]  Here we go. Oh shit. That's not good. This is a bad start. I don't know. I took too much damage
[10847.19s -> 10873.69s]  there. Way too much. Do you have a sword in phase one too? I didn't know that. I wonder what the
[10873.69s -> 10879.13s]  actual way to avoid that is. There's gotta be like a, oh, it's the meta way. It has to be some
[10879.13s -> 10907.59s]  way to do it. I have no idea what it is though. Way too much damage. This, this, this one's,
[10907.59s -> 10925.93s]  this one's not, this one doesn't count. Yeah, this one doesn't count. This one doesn't count.
[10926.49s -> 10954.01s]  This one doesn't count. I tried to turn this like keyboard turning in world of Warcraft.
[10954.01s -> 10985.38s]  It's just an observation. Shoot. Oh, oh, peanut butter. All right. Pull back. Pull back. Pull
[10985.38s -> 11011.94s]  back. I thought it was me that did that to you, but it was you that did that to me. Why already?
[11011.94s -> 11016.58s]  What? Oh my God. I'm kicking his ass. I didn't realize how much I was kicking his ass.
[11030.14s -> 11035.74s]  I didn't realize this one was, I was just pressing random buttons. I thought this one was a,
[11035.74s -> 11058.12s]  just like, I'm not going to do it, but whatever. You know, if I had like 10% more patience,
[11059.00s -> 11071.11s]  I would be doing a lot better. Okay. I'm going to, I'm going to go in with this 10% more patience.
[11071.11s -> 11091.56s]  Let's try that. Is the character still in the game? Oh, okay. I was like, what the fuck is
[11091.56s -> 11155.67s]  happening? Shit. I wish you weren't so high in the air. You can tell when it doesn't work.
[11155.91s -> 11186.46s]  Oh, I couldn't even see it on the screen. Did that hurt? Kind of? Yep. That would have been
[11186.46s -> 11214.95s]  great. All right. Patience. Patience. Have it please. I accidentally just pressed up on the
[11214.95s -> 11223.72s]  D-pad. I don't even know how that happened, but I know it did. I didn't mean to press that.
[11224.52s -> 11230.12s]  Uh, that's why I'm going to take this one as a loss.
[11244.62s -> 11270.54s]  Oh shit. Okay. Um, so this is very, very, very difficult, but it's not impossible.
[11274.14s -> 11280.01s]  I'm not even sure difficult is the, I don't think it's even necessarily that's difficult.
[11280.01s -> 11286.04s]  It's that you are, you're, you're stepping on the gas. Your foot is all the way to the
[11286.04s -> 11290.98s]  bottom of the car and it doesn't stop until the mission ends. I think you just,
[11290.98s -> 11303.61s]  you have to be on point the whole, you gotta be on point the whole time. We're doing just fine.
[11304.25s -> 11360.71s]  Okay. Here it is. Not bad. Pretty good start. Keep it up. No. Back up. Here we go.
[11362.63s -> 11369.19s]  All right. Phase two, swinging incoming. Underneath it. That's exactly what I wanted to do.
[11369.91s -> 11383.45s]  How many swings do you have? How many times does he swing? Oh boy. I'm out of dashes.
[11384.41s -> 11400.76s]  Oh, you're doing way too many of those in a row. Back it up. Back it up. Back it up. Back it up.
[11411.08s -> 11423.46s]  No. What happened? What happened? I got hit by like a hundred missiles. What the hell?
[11442.20s -> 11463.69s]  I hit him. I wish the lock on circle was like red. Sometimes it's hard to tell if I'm even
[11463.69s -> 11476.55s]  locked on. Can I change that in the options? Can I change that? I wish I could make it red.
[11482.17s -> 11489.48s]  I don't know how you reliably dodge those. It's just a hundred million of them. That one didn't
[11489.48s -> 11535.93s]  count. Should I stay back from the missiles? Maybe? I don't know. They just spam. I guess
[11535.93s -> 11560.09s]  like maybe just go. No. How are you supposed to dodge that? Okay. Just assault boost pass.
[11560.09s -> 11565.37s]  Aren't they homing though? Yeah. They're like, they're like on me. All right. I had him. I had
[11565.37s -> 11580.97s]  him beat. I just got to get back on it. Let's go. Start over. Does that kind of work? It uses so
[11580.97s -> 11585.53s]  much. Look, and it's happening again. I don't have any more boost. No, I'm doing it my way.
[11603.45s -> 11615.74s]  I wonder if I can, can I just outrun it? Maybe.
[11623.96s -> 11634.07s]  I just hit every button on my, I hit Y, X, A, and V at the exact same time.
[11634.79s -> 11649.70s]  It's just so much happening. I feel like I'm in a crashing plane.
[11658.60s -> 11676.87s]  Is that anger? What? No, that was not anger. That was me making a joke. That was a joke. That was
[11676.87s -> 11683.61s]  like a, I did funny noises. That's not anger. That's funny sound effects. You cannot be angry
[11683.69s -> 11695.22s]  and make funny sound effects. That's not how it works. I got them down to like 1%. I'm going to,
[11695.22s -> 11699.22s]  okay. Time to be quiet. Let's go. This is the one right here. This is actually the one right now.
[11699.22s -> 11752.18s]  Watch this. What hit me? I'm so confused.
[11752.82s -> 11769.64s]  So intensify, Raiden. Get clear.
[11788.89s -> 11809.99s]  Here comes the swing.
[11834.68s -> 11839.03s]  Do that quick.
[11854.73s -> 11868.30s]  Oh my goodness. I can't believe I didn't get killed.
[11868.54s -> 11880.02s]  Oh my goodness. You gotta be kidding me. Oh, it's okay. I'm not even mad about it.
[11880.02s -> 11894.68s]  I can't believe it. I can't, I can't believe it. God dang it. Darn it. Oh, darn it. That's
[11894.68s -> 11902.81s]  a big darn it right there. That was one HP. That's such a huge darn it. That's, that is like a,
[11902.81s -> 11913.82s]  oh gosh, dang it. Oh, that sucks. I can't even, it's all right.
[11918.22s -> 11922.14s]  Hey, we're good. Let's go. I'll do it again. I'll do it again right now.
[11929.80s -> 11959.02s]  I'll do it again right now. Recharge, recharge, recharge, recharge. Why can't I recharge?
[11978.89s -> 11984.79s]  Oh, damn it. I have to restart.
[11988.87s -> 11997.99s]  Okay. Now I'm just, I, I, I, I need to do one hit. I can't believe it.
[12012.14s -> 12013.21s]  Okay.
[12026.39s -> 12035.72s]  Oh, get in there. What? That doesn't count.
[12049.40s -> 12065.75s]  Here we go. More of this bullshit. Good start. I can't believe I didn't hit that.
[12066.39s -> 12070.87s]  I wish I knew what happened there. I was locked on. It just didn't stay locked on.
[12073.54s -> 12078.02s]  That's a complaint. I lose. No, I'm complaining now. That's a, that's actually a complaint.
[12079.72s -> 12083.40s]  I didn't press the right stick. I didn't trip the lock on off. I'm complaining. It's over.
[12084.28s -> 12096.81s]  Yeah, this is a complaint. I wouldn't necessarily say I'm angry. I would say I'm complaining.
[12106.81s -> 12113.21s]  I'm going to put a, this weapon, uh, is, is ass against this enemy because yeah,
[12113.21s -> 12118.01s]  give me a different, how do I do it again? How do I, how do I put a different weapon on?
[12119.72s -> 12123.40s]  This bubble weapon is cool, but like, how are you ever going to attack somebody?
[12123.40s -> 12129.86s]  Like he just flies around the whole map and at the range is like medium range. I'm yeah, it's ass.
[12129.86s -> 12135.30s]  Hey, I not, I didn't get filtered yet. I had, the boss had one HP 10 minutes ago. Don't forget that.
[12136.10s -> 12151.75s]  I ain't getting, no, this is bullshit. You take one of those. It's half of your entire health pool.
[12187.78s -> 12205.13s]  My eyes are itching. Yeah, this, look at this. Okay. This bubble gun,
[12205.13s -> 12210.65s]  you can shoot it for like a one second before it overheats. This thing fucking stinks.
[12214.23s -> 12218.55s]  You go overheated. Oh my God. This thing sucks. Asshole.
[12243.32s -> 12279.32s]  Okay. Come on. Come on. Shit. That, how did that even hit me? I dodged it perfectly.
[12297.80s -> 12318.82s]  Still not good. I don't, I have like no health. All right. You know what? Kill me. Cause I,
[12318.82s -> 12324.66s]  I want to take this bubble gun off. One, two, you shoot this thing for two seconds and it overheats
[12325.30s -> 12332.33s]  in the middle of a giant fight where there's just shit screaming at you. And like missiles are
[12332.33s -> 12337.13s]  shooting you from every single direction from every angle. It's hard to look at that tiny
[12337.13s -> 12348.90s]  little bar to see if it's red. I'm sorry. It just is. Get this thing the fuck out of here.
[12348.90s -> 12363.22s]  Sell it. Oh shit. I don't have anything. Is this even better? All right. No more complaining. Let's
[12363.22s -> 12414.22s]  go. I'm trying to be so patient. There's just shit everywhere. Oh really?
[12415.18s -> 12429.19s]  That's unfortunate. I need to get more heels. Probably. I feel like that's holding me back
[12429.19s -> 12455.18s]  too. I already have one health. If you don't get to phase two without two, it's over. Okay. Let's
[12455.18s -> 12480.90s]  pull back. I hit that. There's always one little straggle rocket. That's like, so you do through
[12480.90s -> 12494.10s]  all this. And then it's like like that. Maybe you just, I'm just going to ski. I'm not even
[12494.10s -> 12503.08s]  going to attack like that. Just drive. Does this work? Kind of. Oh no, it does not. Oh no, it does
[12503.08s -> 12574.90s]  not. Okay. Good start. Very good start. Exceptional start. Oh shit. Okay. Ski, ski, ski. All right,
[12574.90s -> 12615.40s]  back up, back up, back up, back up. Not bad. Not bad. Here comes the swing. Yep. What hit me? What
[12615.40s -> 12683.90s]  hit me? What hit me? What hit me? I fucking lose. Oh no. Oh no. It's just got such an insane cone.
[12683.90s -> 12704.23s]  It's like, it's like, it's like 300 degrees in front of this motherfucker. Again, like another
[12704.31s -> 12724.22s]  2% boss fight. Give me a break. Be more aggressive. I feel like last time I've tried to be
[12724.22s -> 12746.31s]  aggressive. He just kills me in two hits. Here, do the little sneaky, like, go on, do it. Do your
[12746.31s -> 12777.58s]  little, there it is. Oh, you got it. I'm literally waiting for it. What the fuck is happening?
[12802.38s -> 12807.18s]  Oh my God. He just almost double tapped me in one second. Holy shit. I got way too aggressive.
[12850.58s -> 12906.23s]  What? Oh, already? That doesn't look like 50% to me. Holy shit. What? Where did, he just like
[12906.23s -> 12915.64s]  scooped me up in the middle of his mouth. Oh my God. I can't believe I almost beat this guy with
[12915.64s -> 12967.26s]  one health three times. You shoot behind you? Oh, come on. That's absolute fucking horse shit.
[12967.74s -> 13023.80s]  It really is. Back it up. No, you fucking idiot. Stop flying directly over my head.
[13033.11s -> 13038.71s]  Get away from my head. Get, get out of here. Go back to your corner. You're like, you're broken.
[13056.87s -> 13061.03s]  Dude. What? I couldn't jump. What? Why couldn't I jump? I was trying to jump.
[13061.59s -> 13068.70s]  He was like glued to the ground. What the hell happened? I, I was pressing A. How come I didn't
[13068.70s -> 13129.32s]  fly? Was I out of, was I out of juice? Damn it. Fuck you buddy. I got like just caught up. That
[13129.32s -> 13143.05s]  was so fucking stupid. He flew over me and I couldn't stay locked on. Come back when you're
[13143.05s -> 13165.86s]  level 80. You don't level up in this game, do you? I need to grind side quest. I mean, dude,
[13165.86s -> 13174.01s]  I have come one centimeter of his bar of health, like four times. I can do it. I just have to get
[13174.65s -> 13190.07s]  the last hit in and just kill the guy. We're doing this right now. Like, holy shit.
[13190.71s -> 13196.38s]  Give me a fucking break. Key, I'm literally keyboard turning in World of Warcraft.
[13214.20s -> 13223.19s]  Okay. We're good.
[13235.93s -> 13248.04s]  All right. Come on. This is the one right here. This is it. No more bullshit. I can't see anything.
[13249.02s -> 13280.82s]  All right. We're good. Oh, come on. That's just so stupid. You just, sometimes you're just in a
[13280.82s -> 13286.47s]  spot where you're going to get hit by that. Sometimes you just don't, you can't dodge anymore.
[13287.03s -> 13302.68s]  This is un-fucking-bearable. This is boss number three. What does boss number 17 look like? Holy
[13302.68s -> 13326.62s]  shit. Have any humans completed this game yet? All right. This is a good start.
[13347.59s -> 13352.26s]  Huh? What? Oh, I got staggered by something. All right. Pull it together.
[13355.14s -> 13368.15s]  Come on.
[13389.05s -> 13394.44s]  What? Why are you stopping? I did not tell you to stop. Why are you stopping moving?
[13402.65s -> 13411.51s]  Oh my god. I just got, my elbow was stuck on my chair. Hold on. I gotta move this. This is in
[13411.51s -> 13436.49s]  the way now. Okay. There we go. That's better. I have free movement of my arms now. I might be able
[13436.57s -> 13477.50s]  to do it. Oh, I'm out of juice. I'm out of juice. I need to build juice right now. No, dude. That's
[13477.50s -> 13522.81s]  the exact thing I didn't want to have happen. Oh boy. We're good. I win. I win. Okay. How did I
[13522.81s -> 13532.36s]  think I was ever going to get through that without complaining? I'm telling you, I put my, these
[13532.36s -> 13561.11s]  things down. That's better. Phase three. Don't even say that. That was hard. Let me just bite the
[13561.11s -> 13587.26s]  controller real quick. Cause you hear it? I was going like this. It was like gripping it like
[13590.54s -> 13621.91s]  480,000 credits. Wow. That's pretty sick. Is he going to rage at the spider boss?
[13624.81s -> 13628.97s]  Probably. I don't think we should do any more bets on that because it absolutely is happening,
[13630.73s -> 13637.66s]  but we're going to move on to a coin game. I want to play coin game for like an hour or two.
[13640.26s -> 13643.85s]  I got over the hump. I can come back to this if I want to.
[13645.62s -> 13651.35s]  You said you could hear a strange voice in your head. I can see why that boss is considered a
[13652.63s -> 13660.50s]  with the difficulty really turns on. That was fun. I like it. Do you like the game? Yeah.
[13662.46s -> 13667.74s]  All the From Software games do this shit. They make you go through every stage of grief,
[13667.74s -> 13673.10s]  question your reality, question, question everything. And then when you finally beat it,
[13673.10s -> 13678.33s]  you go, that wasn't even a big deal. That wasn't even a big deal. That was nothing.
[13679.29s -> 13695.45s]  It looks fun to be fair. I would say it's very fun. How red are you? Actually, not really.
[13702.84s -> 13708.65s]  You probably can take on anything after beating that guy. That's encouraging. Hey,
[13708.65s -> 13716.09s]  thanks guys. Sweat check. Uh, I don't, well, you can't, I can't do a sweat check.
[13716.17s -> 13728.82s]  There's nothing to check. Check the messages.
[13742.09s -> 13751.11s]  Only him and the next one are really hard actually, in my opinion. So wait,
[13751.11s -> 13762.17s]  this is not the case of like boss 15 is not insane. Boss three is very difficult. And then
[13762.17s -> 13765.85s]  is that, Oh, okay. It is. All right. I see. I see. There's one guy. All right.
[13766.57s -> 13772.23s]  Boss four is ridiculous. Boss 15 is insane. The other bosses aren't. Okay.
[13776.15s -> 13779.51s]  So it is what I was describing. So have you guys beaten this yet? I'm imagining
[13779.83s -> 13785.11s]  virtual encounters are now available in the arena. We invite you to hone your technique.
[13787.35s -> 13797.45s]  Yes. I have four times new mercenary data. Ooh, I unlocked new arena. Well, that's cool. I think
[13797.45s -> 13805.22s]  that's a good stopping point though. I am a fan. I will probably stream it again. Just not right now
[13805.86s -> 13810.26s]  because right now I want to play coin game. Coin game got an update a few months ago that I never
[13810.26s -> 13813.90s]  played. I don't think it's anything too substantial, but there's at least another
[13813.90s -> 13820.73s]  arcade, I think. So let's go check it out. If that's all you want to see for armored core,
[13820.73s -> 13827.51s]  maybe I'll play it again at some point. But if I can beat that, then I think I can handle most
[13827.51s -> 13832.46s]  of the rest of the game. So let's go play coin game. Actually, let me get, let me go pee. I'll
[13832.46s -> 13842.78s]  be right back. And I'll come back with coin game. How does that sound? Sounds good to me. Um,
[13848.04s -> 13849.08s]  all right. Be right back.
