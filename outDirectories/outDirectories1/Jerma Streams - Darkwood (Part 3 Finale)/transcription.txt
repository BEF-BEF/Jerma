[0.76s -> 8.60s]  Hello, it's muted. Yeah, I was cleaning a few things up. Let's take a fair, fair few things.
[8.60s -> 24.95s]  How we doing? Welcome back to another stream. Tonight we're gonna do more Darkwood and hopefully
[26.47s -> 31.05s]  get somewhere close to the end. If we don't get close to the end then
[32.86s -> 38.22s]  gonna have to do it a different day. Gonna have to finish it at some point and when I come back
[38.78s -> 45.08s]  after the weekend here. But before we do any of that, before we talk about Darkwood
[47.16s -> 55.74s]  or even play Darkwood, we have something to talk about. What's wrong? I'm gonna wait till people
[55.74s -> 65.82s]  come in because I have a small announcement to make. Triplets! We're gonna have triplets!
[66.62s -> 84.17s]  Just kidding. So there is gonna be a Halloween stream this year and the Halloween stream is
[84.17s -> 94.36s]  going to be a fairly elaborate one. But hold on. I need to wait because there's a lot to this that
[94.36s -> 107.72s]  needs some explaining. Let me just wait till people trickle in. I'm excited. I'm excited
[107.72s -> 116.94s]  because this is gonna be a shitshow. Here comes the bugleberry takeover. Somebody actually
[116.94s -> 126.20s]  mentioned this yesterday and it was so hard to not say anything. Do you know how difficult it is? I
[126.20s -> 131.37s]  cannot get- don't ever tell me a secret, first of all. If you have a- hey man I gotta tell you-
[131.37s -> 138.17s]  I gotta tell you a secret. Oh, Jerry. Oh my god. He was like so annoying today. I'm gonna tell Jerry
[138.89s -> 145.53s]  immediately. Like within 10 minutes. We're gonna be like, bye! You're gonna be walking away and
[145.53s -> 150.57s]  Jerry's gonna walk by. Jerry! I got to tell you something, Jerry. Don't ever tell me a secret.
[153.96s -> 160.04s]  He's just a snitch. No, no, no. That's a really bad example. That's a terrible example. No,
[160.04s -> 164.60s]  if somebody told me like a secret, something in confidence, I would not tell anybody if they
[164.60s -> 169.88s]  didn't want me to. I'm just saying like I'm- it's hard for me to sit on information.
[175.08s -> 178.44s]  Jerry trusted you. No, it wasn't Jerry that trusted me. It was somebody else.
[180.17s -> 183.53s]  No, no, no. Let's put it- no, no, no. Hold on. Let me rephrase that.
[184.33s -> 190.60s]  If you told me, hey I want to- we're planning Jerry's surprise birthday party for next weekend.
[191.16s -> 196.70s]  Oh, this is gonna be three clowns. We're gonna have a tractor. There's gonna be like a fire engine's
[196.70s -> 201.58s]  gonna come and honk the horn. I'm gonna be like, holy shit, that's awesome. I'm gonna see Jerry the
[201.58s -> 207.10s]  next day and I'm gonna accidentally be like, what are we talking about anything? And I will slip up
[207.10s -> 212.46s]  and say, oh dude, like the- that's such a bright red. Oh, that's such a beautiful bright red. You're
[212.46s -> 217.35s]  right on that painting. Just like the fire truck that's gonna be there next weekend. That's what
[217.35s -> 226.34s]  it is. Yeah, I corrected it. It's better. So it's not- I'm not like a- I don't like- I'm not gonna
[226.34s -> 232.23s]  like somebody tell me something in confidence, but that would be in confidence too. But anyways,
[233.11s -> 237.03s]  so this stream is gonna be on maybe Halloween, maybe a day before,
[237.59s -> 242.95s]  maybe a couple days. It depends. We have to lock in the dates here, but we're going to do a secret
[242.95s -> 251.40s]  slime action stream. What is this? What are you guys- what are you guys linking me?
[253.08s -> 265.16s]  Robotic Sideshow. Jay Albertson's Robotic Sideshow? What? No. Is this in the game?
[267.43s -> 280.14s]  Wait, what? No, it's not. Holy shit. Okay, that's awesome. Really? Oh, that's awesome.
[282.04s -> 295.46s]  It's a new community map in the- oh wow. That's so cool. I am- I'm like flo- I don't even know
[295.46s -> 304.06s]  what to say. That's so cool. I thought there was like somebody just made a- like a Photoshop or
[304.06s -> 309.08s]  something, but that's- that's awesome. There's a Vinesauce- Vinesauce stuff in there too. That's
[309.08s -> 318.73s]  awesome. I'm gonna have to check that out. He's gonna cry. That's so cute. Yeah, I'll show it on
[318.73s -> 325.83s]  screen. That's really cool. But anyways, yeah, that's- I got all kinds of emotions going on
[325.83s -> 333.50s]  right now. There's like four different emotions. I'm excited, I'm happy, I'm like humbled, I'm
[333.50s -> 339.26s]  surprised. This is- I got all of it. The whole cast of Inside Out is in here right now,
[339.26s -> 345.00s]  and they're all talking at the same time. Except for the- no, the anger. I got- the anger is on
[345.00s -> 351.42s]  lunch, and fear is on lunch. So only like four- like three of them. I don't even know- I've never even
[351.42s -> 354.46s]  seen- I don't- I don't- I don't even know- I don't know what that plot of that movie is. I've never
[354.46s -> 359.42s]  seen it. I just know that there's like emotions that all hang out in somebody's body. I don't- I've
[359.42s -> 366.36s]  never seen it. But, uh, besides that, which is awesome, we are going to be doing on Halloween
[366.36s -> 375.88s]  a secret slime action stream. What does that mean? Well, it's taken about three or four days to
[375.88s -> 382.28s]  scramble to get this done, but I have to do it. Over the next few weeks, the next two weeks or so,
[382.84s -> 387.64s]  not now, but this weekend, probably- probably Sunday or into Monday, there's going to be a
[387.64s -> 395.06s]  couple new channels in the Discord. In those channels, what you are going to do is you are
[395.06s -> 400.76s]  going to come up with- one channel will be for discussion. So you can talk about it. What- what
[400.76s -> 407.56s]  should we do? What should we try to see? What he'll do? Discussing actions that I am going to be doing
[408.20s -> 415.24s]  on stream without my knowledge. Just like that, those old Nickelodeon shows. So, for instance,
[415.24s -> 421.88s]  I'll give you an example. Scratching your nose. That's going to be one of the actions, possibly.
[421.88s -> 426.20s]  And if I do the actions that you guys come up with during the course of probably 10 rounds,
[427.08s -> 437.53s]  I get slimed. With real slime. Sitting at a computer. Now, that's all fun and dandy,
[437.53s -> 445.43s]  but what about you? See, you also are going to have actions that you cannot say or do. And if
[445.43s -> 451.80s]  you do them, then you're gone during the course of that stream. So I get to come up with a two.
[454.60s -> 460.20s]  So each round, there will be maybe one or two actions that we both cannot do. There will be a
[460.20s -> 470.92s]  bot. There will be- it's time for slime, thanks to five community subs right on time. So your goal-
[470.92s -> 475.00s]  well, the goal here is, let's say, uh, I'm going to try to explain this piece by piece because it
[475.00s -> 479.72s]  takes a lot of explanation for it to understand even what the hell this is. I am going to start
[479.72s -> 484.23s]  with a certain amount of points and we're going to do it by rounds and each round is going to have
[484.23s -> 490.36s]  a timer on it. So after 15 minutes or so, that'll be the end of round one. And however many people
[490.36s -> 498.06s]  did the thing in chat that was the secret chat slime action, those people are out of the game.
[498.06s -> 504.06s]  I'm not going to make this easy for you. It's going to be very, very, very hard for you not to talk
[504.06s -> 512.65s]  about stuff. Just don't chat. That's fine. But we're going to have a program that is going to be
[512.65s -> 524.06s]  created to track who is participating in the games. You're not going to hit permaband. Why would you
[524.30s -> 532.60s]  permaband? This is going to be a lot of fun. And that's just part one. Uh, I think my computer
[532.60s -> 542.92s]  crashed. No, it's fine. Uh, there are going to be three separate activities that happen on this
[542.92s -> 549.50s]  stream. That's part one. There's a part two and a part three that I don't really want to talk to you
[549.50s -> 563.78s]  about because that would kind of spoil it, essentially. Not yet. BF Bugleberry, please.
[563.78s -> 567.46s]  I mean, that's the most hated character in the whole entire universe, this whole channel.
[568.18s -> 571.86s]  I don't, I don't, I don't think that Bugleberry will make an appearance. I mean, why would they?
[579.34s -> 583.18s]  But, uh, there's going to be more, I just want to really bring it up briefly because I don't want
[583.18s -> 588.54s]  to overwhelm everybody yet. Uh, but there's going to be a Halloween stream, secret slime actions.
[589.18s -> 596.42s]  You're going to be directly competing against me to not do the thing that you and I have come up
[596.42s -> 603.48s]  with over a series of 10 rounds. If I get slimed, I lose points. Each person in chat is worth one
[603.48s -> 608.92s]  point. So if you get eliminated, that's minus one point for the whole, all of you are working
[608.92s -> 621.26s]  together on this. There's no such thing as minus one. Well, there is now. You're going to lose.
[621.26s -> 624.54s]  I don't know. It depends. It depends on what you guys can come up with for actions and they
[624.54s -> 633.16s]  could be anything, but make them good. We'll talk more about this at the end of the stream.
[633.16s -> 640.70s]  I don't want to overwhelm you. Breathing. And no, it can't be anything like that.
[643.22s -> 649.46s]  Stuff that is required to survive is not a secret slime action. It's breathing.
[651.48s -> 656.20s]  Like air going in and out of your nose is not a thing that can slime me. Drinking water.
[659.86s -> 665.35s]  I mean, okay. What if like, if going to the bathroom is one of them and I get slimed in the
[665.35s -> 679.67s]  bathroom, that's so stupid. But we'll, we'll come up with some stuff. I want to give it to you now.
[680.55s -> 683.59s]  So you can start to preliminary think about it in your brain.
[684.55s -> 688.47s]  And those of you that have never seen any of the old Nickelodeon shows where they used to do weird
[688.47s -> 694.98s]  shit like this, I'm going to try to not do the things that you are. Cause remember, I don't know.
[695.86s -> 700.34s]  I'm not going to know what you guys are suggesting. The people running the show have all that
[700.34s -> 708.28s]  information. So I don't know. Oh, Hey, by the way, don't, uh, don't sneeze this round. I don't know
[708.28s -> 712.60s]  what is potentially picked, but it just comes from a pool of things that you guys have suggested.
[715.77s -> 720.14s]  Also, I want to talk about this too. This is a talk about stuff stream.
[721.40s -> 724.90s]  A week or two after that, I'm going back in front of the green screen.
[725.54s -> 730.18s]  We're going to do green screen DLC for free. This is going to be the name of that stream.
[738.97s -> 743.69s]  We're going to do a whole nother thing where we take in more of your suggestions for actions
[744.25s -> 748.50s]  over the course of a couple of weeks. And I'm going back in front and we're going to give you
[748.50s -> 759.80s]  guys more material because it makes me laugh every time. So I don't want to throw this all
[759.80s -> 769.78s]  at you at once, but that stuff is happening. He's stalling the stream. He hates dark wood.
[773.24s -> 783.80s]  Happy Halloween from this company to spider. All right. For a second, I thought that was coffee
[784.36s -> 788.68s]  and I was about to gag. It's lemon water. I don't know why I thought it was an ice coffee.
[794.94s -> 798.14s]  So we're in dark wood. We're going to continue. We're going to play dark wood. I'm going to try
[798.14s -> 801.82s]  to finish dark wood. I might. I don't know. Is it going to be tough to get to the end of this?
[801.82s -> 810.70s]  We'll see. We're on day 19. We will find out if I can do it or not. This might be a situation
[810.70s -> 815.34s]  where I play for like six hours and go, we'll finish it later. Or I might just Simpsons hit and
[815.34s -> 832.66s]  run sit here until it's done. But we left off. I'm so fucking excited for this stream. I can't
[832.66s -> 840.81s]  wait for the slot, the secret slime Halloween stream. You even examine seven hours. I have to
[840.81s -> 848.17s]  sleep. Well, I'll try to get it done in seven hours. So I'll get done in five. And there are
[848.17s -> 850.81s]  people that are going to be coming into the stream. That's why I didn't want to throw it all out at
[850.81s -> 855.70s]  the beginning and just, it is an overwhelming amount of information that I think is better
[855.70s -> 859.46s]  if just like read in a discord because I'm going to write up a whole thing for you guys to like
[859.46s -> 863.70s]  read in the pinned channel there. There'll be two channels. One of them would be for discussions
[863.70s -> 868.90s]  on things that you want me to, but not that you want me to do things that you think I will do
[869.78s -> 877.90s]  that I don't know. And one for obviously a single sentence of what that thing is.
[878.78s -> 885.66s]  We'll talk about it again at the end of the stream. So the last thing I remember is we
[885.66s -> 896.87s]  organized the workbench. Don't, don't put them in here. I don't want to see them. Are you trying
[896.87s -> 902.76s]  to win this competition or you want me to be prepared for when it happens? And some of these
[902.76s -> 907.32s]  rounds, by the way, once we get to like round five, six, seven, eight, there might be multiple
[907.32s -> 911.40s]  actions that if you do, you know, if there might be three or four things on the screen that I can't
[911.40s -> 925.00s]  do, we're going to make it hard. And you too don't get banned blinking. No, that's, that's a human
[925.00s -> 933.91s]  survival reaction that doesn't count. All right. So the last thing I was going to do was that the
[933.91s -> 940.39s]  wolf, the wolf told me, Hey, you got to go up here now. Cause here's the hideout up here.
[940.39s -> 943.11s]  And there's a, there's a spot here that I'm going to go up and I'm going to just get to
[943.11s -> 953.13s]  the hideout, new hideout incoming. Look, look, look, look, look. You guys are on like, all right.
[958.78s -> 970.31s]  Cool. I guess anyways, uh, what do I have? I have, I need some new armor. I got to kill a bug.
[971.59s -> 975.43s]  I also have, I need to take some stuff with me because this is the journey
[976.39s -> 983.29s]  to go to the next hideout. I need a couple of things. Gas. I'm going to bring some wood and
[983.29s -> 991.56s]  I'm going to bring a bunch of nails. What else do I want to bring with me to survive this place?
[991.56s -> 1003.05s]  To, to have an, okay. The bandages. I need alcohol. All right. This goal is just to get to the
[1003.05s -> 1009.27s]  hideout, the new hideout. I think everything else is fine. What about batteries? Yeah. I'll take a
[1009.27s -> 1020.42s]  couple of batteries, a couple of things of gas, get this bottle out of here. Scrap metal. Let me
[1020.42s -> 1028.55s]  take that too. All right. I'm ready to get out of here and try to get to the next hideout.
[1033.99s -> 1038.31s]  Jerma's current score is minus 46. That doesn't count. People did minus one, like a hundred,
[1038.31s -> 1045.58s]  a hundred times. How, how do I already have minus 40? No, I'm serious. How do I already have minus
[1045.58s -> 1053.50s]  46? I haven't done anything. I haven't said anything. I talked about like, what is this? Reddit?
[1061.88s -> 1073.40s]  Gave us a little low. All right. Let's go. I'm going. Uh, so, uh, the fastest route is to go
[1073.40s -> 1080.79s]  all the way up left and up. I have bandages. Let me put those bandages on. I got pills too.
[1080.79s -> 1090.15s]  And I got lock picks. I'm ready. Let's put the, no, the pills. No bandages. Okay. Go for it.
[1091.42s -> 1096.44s]  Time to go to a new hideout and do the, uh, this third little zone up here,
[1097.24s -> 1105.40s]  cause that's where I need to go. You forgot the bell. Wow. I almost just ruined this whole place
[1105.40s -> 1115.26s]  for you. I almost just just forgot those things hurt you already up to a great start. All right.
[1115.26s -> 1125.64s]  Come on. Give me the bell. Who the hell's the bell? Is this just in like a wardrobe somewhere?
[1126.52s -> 1136.57s]  There it is. All right. All right. All right. All right. Let's go out. Out. Let's go new hideout.
[1142.84s -> 1156.14s]  I got plenty of time. Do I still use a Velcro wallet? What the fuck are you talking about?
[1158.66s -> 1175.21s]  No, I wish I still had Velcro shoes. Velcro shoes are awesome because they allow you
[1175.21s -> 1181.78s]  Velcro shoes are just so easy to put on. All right. I got two people. Let's go.
[1186.50s -> 1190.97s]  He's getting better. Take the rag, leave the bottle. Let's go. Not wasting time.
[1192.41s -> 1201.77s]  Velcro underwear. I, that doesn't make any sense. The bike man's not going to get stuff out of the
[1201.77s -> 1210.33s]  wardrobe. It's too late. I fucking, if today was a secret slime stream, just do step in poison
[1210.33s -> 1225.96s]  mushrooms. I would, it would happen immediately. He gets everything in the hideout. Well, why are
[1225.96s -> 1228.92s]  you yelling at me? That's what somebody in chat just, that's what people in chat were telling me.
[1230.47s -> 1243.10s]  Well, I, why is everybody yelling at me? I left it in there. Okay. I need to heal with no, not yet.
[1243.10s -> 1249.06s]  It's not, I'm not, it's having that one. Okay. I'm probably going to need to heal. Found a cottage.
[1250.02s -> 1259.99s]  I haven't seen this yet. Why? Get out of here. Oh my fucking God. Really? No, not really. You're
[1259.99s -> 1275.18s]  still, he's just tracking me. Dude, get the fuck out of here. I don't want to, now I have to heal.
[1291.61s -> 1296.81s]  Whatever. I, I need to see what's in here. No, I'm on a very specific mission. I can do it later.
[1297.69s -> 1316.09s]  The hunter becomes the hunted. So I'll go up from here. Moose Monka S. I know it's
[1316.09s -> 1327.42s]  scary. Old car. Ooh, broken truck. Let's take another thing of gas, scrap. Hello. What is it?
[1331.38s -> 1343.14s]  Keep going. Just get it. I got to get to the hideout. I got to focus. The wolf told me to go up here
[1343.78s -> 1355.13s]  and I need to get up there before it gets too dark so I can get a sanctuary ready. Nothing else.
[1355.13s -> 1362.66s]  Don't pick up anything. Don't do anything. Just get up there. Watch out for the poison.
[1364.10s -> 1376.23s]  Straight line. The best way to go. I have to be getting close. Give me a landmark. All right,
[1376.23s -> 1386.23s]  here we go. I'm right here. Is this it? Is this the entrance? Am I going the right way?
[1386.79s -> 1406.71s]  Scrap. Nice. Still over here. Found the bridge. Here we go. Uh, I'm gonna take the wood.
[1407.35s -> 1414.82s]  So now I gotta get, that's kind of far away. Am I gonna even get here in time?
[1415.54s -> 1448.39s]  I might have to. He's just zigzagging. Oh, that's so bad. Red meat. Okay, hold on. I need to make a.
[1449.03s -> 1476.94s]  This shit is important. Besides the tire. All right, get me out of here. I got such a long way
[1476.94s -> 1497.54s]  to. Is another one of these? Oh, for the love of God. Well, this sucks. He's still alive. Why is
[1497.54s -> 1534.87s]  he still alive? Damn it. This is going to suck. You're telling me that's what's up here? That's
[1534.87s -> 1542.09s]  what I have to be aware of now. That's what I have to deal with every time. It's no longer the guys
[1542.09s -> 1553.35s]  with the. I have a long way to go to that hideout. Whatever it is, I'll get it later. Creepy house.
[1553.35s -> 1563.53s]  Don't go to the creepy house. Just go to where I need to be. Is this like slender? Yeah, it's
[1563.53s -> 1573.99s]  essentially it's top down slender. Oh shit. This stuff that I know. Just go just get out. I can
[1573.99s -> 1592.39s]  come back here later. I can't climb this here. Almost there. Almost like halfway there. All right,
[1592.39s -> 1600.76s]  it's time to activate the runner. Go. No, no unnatural. No unnatural walling. No natural
[1600.76s -> 1620.34s]  walling. Please. Oh, that's a guy. Broken tree. Get in there. Almost there. Come on. Don't die.
[1642.44s -> 1660.78s]  I need that axe too. Bad. I'm getting lots of meat though. Yeah, I am. All right, come on. Where is
[1660.78s -> 1669.67s]  this? Here we are. Come on. This is it, right? Lots of wood over here. Keep this in mind. Somebody
[1669.67s -> 1692.92s]  remember this. Let's make a good hideout. Oh yes, it would. Turn on the stove. Nobody's in here,
[1692.92s -> 1705.34s]  right? There might be somebody hanging out in here though. Turn on the stove. This is actually sick.
[1705.90s -> 1709.78s]  This place is huge. I'm just gonna hide in the bathroom. Left 4 Dead 2 style.
[1720.06s -> 1734.02s]  Oven. There we go. Light the oven. Awesome. 240 extract. 240, 240, 240. That's a shitload. Nice.
[1735.22s -> 1747.72s]  All right. Very, very good. Where's the workbench? Here. How do I get over there?
[1749.30s -> 1773.24s]  Go like down and then around? The fucker. Here's the workbench. Sickle. Oh, is this better than a
[1773.24s -> 1792.39s]  shovel? All right, what else is over here? It's not better than a shovel, huh? Okay. All right,
[1792.39s -> 1797.91s]  let me get, let me fill up the gas because I'm running out of time here. I gotta start to really
[1797.91s -> 1816.18s]  think about how I'm gonna do this. I tried to pick it up. I tried to pick it up. Okay, hold on.
[1816.18s -> 1832.02s]  I gotta deposit some of this shit. Now keep that. Get the bell for the batteries away.
[1832.82s -> 1839.53s]  I put two of the gasoline tanks away with the wire and the nail. All right. Now I can actually do
[1839.53s -> 1847.86s]  this shit. It's so dark in here. This is so much darker than the other ones. I wonder if I'm like
[1847.86s -> 1857.85s]  stepping on like the bird shit on the ground. Okay, I'm ready to fill up the generator, which is
[1858.89s -> 1862.81s]  over here. Where the fuck is the generator? There's the cooking table. It's over here.
[1865.78s -> 1886.95s]  Okay, gas tank. Spill it up. I got some time. I'll call the guy tomorrow to bring my stuff.
[1887.51s -> 1902.10s]  All right, tank is empty. 16. I got, let me see. So this can't be repaired. So they can come in this
[1902.10s -> 1910.82s]  way. They can come in this way. So generator room is off limits. I can repair. This is all right,
[1910.82s -> 1916.10s]  but no, not really. It's tiny. They can also come through here and they can come through here.
[1916.74s -> 1929.06s]  Not ideal. Here's one of the lights. This room not ideal either. Maybe down here. All right, so
[1930.31s -> 1937.90s]  all right. Okay, I like this area. I can board this. Okay, this is two doors here. I board this one
[1939.00s -> 1941.88s]  and then there's no, this window barricade, this window. Let's just do it now.
[1945.72s -> 1953.22s]  So that's window barricaded, which leaves me with this from here. There's the workbench. There's a
[1953.22s -> 1961.61s]  way to get in this way. No windows, no other ways to get in here. There's that. Okay, so what about,
[1961.61s -> 1982.36s]  what if I just hang out in this hall? Window here. Shit. Window here, barricaded. The window,
[1982.36s -> 1992.31s]  there's only two windows in this. Okay, wooden door. There's a lot of open space here. The safest
[1992.31s -> 2001.13s]  place in this whole house is probably right here. Like right here. Down, like in this bottom hallway.
[2001.13s -> 2012.44s]  There's a lot of places they can get in. Or in here, but you get stuck in here. I don't know,
[2012.44s -> 2026.14s]  I'm running out of time though, so I have to do this now. I could go like this and put traps
[2026.14s -> 2038.78s]  everywhere. Hold on. Let me make a few traps. Let me go to the workbench. Fuck. There's too many
[2038.78s -> 2043.18s]  rooms for me to think about what I want to do. I only have like eight minutes to figure this out.
[2045.48s -> 2053.99s]  When I built my house in Minecraft, it took me like four hours. What about up here? Barricade
[2053.99s -> 2066.46s]  this. Okay. Barricade this door too. I think this is all right right here for the first night. Oh,
[2066.46s -> 2074.25s]  check this out. Watch this. Door right here is all right. They, this is, I'm gonna barricade
[2074.25s -> 2086.94s]  this door. So check this. I can be up here. They can come in through this door. I have barricaded
[2086.94s -> 2094.89s]  window, barricaded door. There's an entry here. There's also an, oh, all right. This might be a
[2094.89s -> 2098.95s]  pretty good spot to be here. I need the, I need the light. I need the lights. I need the lights
[2098.95s -> 2107.86s]  right now. It's fucking dark. Give me a break. I can't see shit. I'm just turning the fucking
[2107.86s -> 2112.95s]  generator on. I don't even know where anything is in this house. There's only one light. There's
[2112.95s -> 2132.68s]  only one lamp here. Oh, that's not good. Um, just get all the windows. This is coming to the hall
[2132.68s -> 2137.80s]  just for tonight. And then tomorrow when I have infinite time, I can figure this out. This is
[2137.80s -> 2163.22s]  coming over here. Make sure I have like a weapon. This is gonna be hell. Okay. So they can't,
[2164.47s -> 2171.19s]  there's no way to get in through here unless they break that wall. I can bring the wardrobe over to,
[2171.19s -> 2176.07s]  wait, I need items. I need items right now. Where's the workbench? I don't remember where
[2176.07s -> 2184.23s]  the workbench is. It's like down here. Okay. Um, battery. I still have a magazine. I still have
[2184.23s -> 2196.63s]  the shovel. Store this stuff. There's heels. Okay. All right. All right. All right. I have some heels.
[2197.35s -> 2201.86s]  Speaking of heels, I got like a second. Okay. No, no, no, no. Get me in.
[2206.70s -> 2227.10s]  All right. I can't barricade this door. I'm gonna have to go for it. Two points of entry.
[2227.90s -> 2230.90s]  Is there anything I can grab here? Like a chair or something right off the bat?
[2231.62s -> 2249.32s]  I need to stop moving. Stop, stop, stop, just stop, stop, stop, stop. Close the door. Oh,
[2249.32s -> 2255.48s]  fuck. What is it? But what is it though? What kind of enemy is it?
[2256.44s -> 2265.99s]  Will he savage? I have a place to run. Keep that in mind. I have a place to run below me.
[2267.56s -> 2273.53s]  And I'm still in the house and I can wrap around. Holy shitty left.
[2273.53s -> 2287.62s]  A dog. A dog just saved my life. A dog just saved my life. No, he didn't. He just got one hit KO.
[2291.85s -> 2322.12s]  Point blank right in the head. What is it? Is he gonna break the door?
[2323.56s -> 2331.91s]  It's just a dog. I'm gonna open the door and hit him. Oh, fuck. Did I break the door?
[2335.64s -> 2358.89s]  Where is it? Oh shit. It's down there. It doesn't know he can go around. I'm gonna aim here.
[2360.71s -> 2369.35s]  Cause there's something in the house. Where is it? Oh shit. Okay. I gotta be ready.
[2371.26s -> 2399.56s]  What is it? Dog. I'm in trouble now. Where is it? Oh my God. It's right there.
[2416.50s -> 2450.95s]  Take it. Ta. Why? I'm gonna move. It's three big dogs. So what happened? One of the dogs
[2450.95s -> 2457.66s]  ate the other dog. What am I drinking? That is water with a little bit of lemon in it.
[2457.74s -> 2461.46s]  Just gives it just enough a little bit of a kick.
[2464.18s -> 2476.15s]  Oh my God. It's a 1-8. Please. Was that two? Was that you guys? Was that somebody in chat?
[2480.63s -> 2488.55s]  Did I just get stream sniped? They both came in instantly and attacked me instant. What?
[2489.82s -> 2507.66s]  Where the fuck were they for the last like hour and 40 minutes? Yeah, it's water. God damn it.
[2507.66s -> 2533.80s]  It was like 730. That sucks. Pain in the ass. All right. So now that I have a minute to look.
[2534.52s -> 2545.62s]  Let me turn the generator off first. That's important. Died to lemon water. If I had my
[2545.62s -> 2553.19s]  hands on... I have to like talk with my fucking hands. Why can't I just sit here? What's going
[2553.19s -> 2567.48s]  on in this room? That... No, I didn't die to lemon water. I died to animated speaking. Well, you see
[2567.48s -> 2571.80s]  just a little bit of a kick of that lemon juice. The lemon... Oh, and there's... Oh, hold on. I'm
[2571.80s -> 2592.57s]  playing a game over here. All right. Generator's off. I have infinite time. Now let's go over a
[2592.57s -> 2602.89s]  strategy. This is not a terrible strategy, but it's not a lot of room to move. So I think I want to
[2602.89s -> 2611.42s]  be in here. There's enough places to move. I could potentially barricade this room as well with the
[2611.42s -> 2616.70s]  oven. And then if only I can... There's a door here. I can barricade this and need to worry about
[2616.70s -> 2629.56s]  these two spots. Trap. Let's check this out. Trap. Trap. Trap. This is where I'm going. This is the
[2629.56s -> 2645.11s]  one. There's three mushrooms in here. I'm going to step on them. If I step on one trap for the
[2645.11s -> 2660.84s]  remainder of this stream, I will do a spin in a circle. All right. So go back to the cooking
[2660.84s -> 2675.45s]  utensil thing. Here we go. Level up. We have a new tier. Careful step. Once a day, you won't trigger
[2675.45s -> 2685.40s]  a trap that you step on. If I step on enough trap for the rest of the day, I'll be able to restore
[2685.40s -> 2695.70s]  my health by eating wood. Once a day, I'll be able to scare off nearby enemies. Yes. I don't care
[2695.70s -> 2702.18s]  what the other ones do. I'll recover longer after exhausting myself. When my stamina gets low,
[2702.18s -> 2709.59s]  I will deal less damage in combat. These are both so awful. Just eat your way out of the forest.
[2711.66s -> 2723.32s]  Eat wood. Eat wood. Eat your desk. Bite your desk. That is good. But I feel like this is a...
[2723.32s -> 2738.92s]  If I had this, I probably would have survived the night last night. Yeah. And this one too. I
[2738.92s -> 2743.90s]  don't want it. This one seems horrible. When my stamina gets low, I'll deal less damage in combat.
[2743.90s -> 2760.92s]  They're both horrible. They're both just game ruiners. Which one is worse? I don't know.
[2763.16s -> 2769.40s]  Weaklings only happens when you put your stamina at zero. Yeah. All right. All right. All right.
[2769.40s -> 2793.22s]  All right. All right. It's done. Eat wood, Omega Lull. Oh, I get what you're doing. Okay. Now
[2794.02s -> 2809.22s]  let's go over here. The smell of grass and trees. The earth bends under my footsteps. The sky swirls
[2809.22s -> 2821.35s]  pleasantly. I think it's here. Bugs haven't even had two headphones in this whole time.
[2824.33s -> 2833.22s]  That's why I've been so bad. Oh, I wasn't expecting this. A completely ordinary dead
[2833.22s -> 2845.30s]  man with a smile on his face. Is that a... Is that a... Is that a monkey? I think. I don't know. I'm
[2845.30s -> 2864.82s]  not sure what to say in the chat. Can you hear it? This is actually kind of scary. Can you hear it?
[2864.82s -> 2876.15s]  Yes, it's you. It's me. Can you hear their song? Get out of here. Get out of here, you
[2877.03s -> 2884.34s]  fucking man-o-wraith. You pre-spell. They deleted you from the game because you sucked.
[2884.90s -> 2896.94s]  Now what's that? What's that? Oh, it's a live stream from German 985.
[2896.94s -> 2914.57s]  Gotta have one wow reference per stream. The game sucks. All right. What we got? What? Why
[2914.57s -> 2934.81s]  did that happen? Oh, I have one of these. 4,000. I'm already 20% of the way there. Not even. I'm 20...
[2934.81s -> 2956.49s]  I'm 22% of the way there. I'm 20% of the way there. Let's see. Where do I want to go?
[2957.29s -> 2981.38s]  German is sweating. Why am I sweating? It's been like 50 minutes. It's your overreactive glands.
[2982.50s -> 2992.22s]  It's been like 10 minutes. It's been an hour. That's how you know that this stream is
[2992.22s -> 3006.78s]  popping. I got like my YouTuber glands. All right. I'm so glad I have frozen time.
[3007.90s -> 3012.95s]  So I need to make traps. I need scrap metal. I got a little bit. I can make like two, three.
[3013.51s -> 3034.46s]  What the fuck do I want to do now? Turn off the webcam. Why would it turn? All right. One guy.
[3035.10s -> 3048.81s]  I'm back. So traps. Let's build them. Let's build them. Let's build them. Let's build them. Let's
[3048.81s -> 3054.81s]  build them. Need to be the workbench. I want bear traps because they're the best.
[3058.41s -> 3066.47s]  He's already... He's already forgotten where the workbench is because this whole game is gray
[3067.69s -> 3072.25s]  with some orange in it. And he's sometimes... His brain cannot decipher between orange and gray
[3075.24s -> 3091.83s]  because he didn't pay attention in school. Bear trap. Make three of them. These are going to help
[3091.83s -> 3100.39s]  me out immensely very soon. Speak up a little. Okay. Fine. Well, there goes the scrap. I needed
[3100.39s -> 3106.95s]  to make sure I could have a weapon, but it's okay. I'll find some. Now these are going to go over
[3106.95s -> 3112.07s]  here. Let's... I think this is the best spot for me. Might not be the best spot for you
[3112.95s -> 3120.55s]  because I can barricade this door. I can hang out in here. I can have a piece of furniture. Once
[3120.55s -> 3125.51s]  this guy gets out of the way, let's get this one down here first. Actually, I actually more
[3125.51s -> 3153.43s]  comfortable having this down here. So if I do this... Can the dogs jump over the table? I don't
[3153.43s -> 3160.20s]  think the dogs can jump over it. Maybe they can. That's a good question. Anyways, here we go.
[3161.00s -> 3171.98s]  I'm thinking of a scenario where we take these three. Let me go like this. Put something here
[3171.98s -> 3181.34s]  and then right here. Bang. They'll get caught in it if they turn. There's one. And then that'll
[3181.34s -> 3188.73s]  give me time. I'm gonna put a piece of furniture here and then one here. I'm gonna... Where am I
[3188.73s -> 3196.15s]  gonna stand though is the real question. Stand... I'll be standing here because against my back
[3196.15s -> 3200.31s]  against this wall, nobody can get in this way. This corner is pretty good. So if I stand up here,
[3200.31s -> 3204.23s]  that means that this would have to go here because they would be... Essentially, they break through
[3204.23s -> 3214.63s]  and they'd be running up this way. So right there. God, I hope this is right. Okay. The third one
[3215.35s -> 3227.30s]  is gonna go down here. Right here. Because they'll break open the door and they'll come up this way.
[3227.86s -> 3249.72s]  I am now ready. Oh, fuck. It's ready. The room is good. There's my entrance.
[3253.32s -> 3262.66s]  There's my other entrance. I hope I can get back in there. I... When I come back, when I come back
[3263.67s -> 3269.91s]  and I... When you see my character Avatar walk through these doors, please, for the love of God,
[3269.91s -> 3280.44s]  I want everybody collectively to type in all capitals. Bear traps. It's the only thing I
[3280.44s -> 3287.37s]  want to see over here because I'm gonna forget this exists in like 30 minutes when I come back
[3287.37s -> 3295.46s]  after scavenging out here. And I'll walk in one and it'll... I'll go like this. Oh, what the fuck?
[3296.66s -> 3314.87s]  And everyone will be like... I was ready. And then I'll be irritated. All right. I'll take a
[3314.87s -> 3321.59s]  mushroom. I have an axe head. What do I need to build the axe? That's very important to me.
[3321.59s -> 3328.14s]  I'm gonna scrap. How many nails do I have? I'm gonna buy them all. I have plenty of money.
[3329.42s -> 3333.34s]  This guy... This guy loves me. So like he's just gonna give all this shit to me.
[3336.39s -> 3348.14s]  Another magazine for the gun. Gas tank. All right. We'll take this one up. He nods. Okay.
[3348.14s -> 3365.21s]  I need Joe. All right. Fuck. I thought I stepped in the trap. I have to cook this. Jesus Christ.
[3365.21s -> 3371.05s]  What the fuck am I doing? I don't want to come back in this room till I have to.
[3380.42s -> 3384.74s]  They need to be placed though. They have to be there. All right. I'm ready. That's the
[3384.74s -> 3388.90s]  survive room. I'm gonna bring the light over there too before anybody starts to panic.
[3389.54s -> 3404.55s]  Get the rags and a battery. I got plenty of lock picks. I took the magazine. All right. Let's do
[3404.55s -> 3411.88s]  this thing. Disarm them now and then arm them at night. That's a very decent chance. That's
[3411.88s -> 3417.16s]  a very decent debate there. But if you dismantle them, you get two scrap and they take three to
[3417.16s -> 3429.69s]  make. Why would somebody have that as an emote? I just thought something was wrong with my channel.
[3432.63s -> 3439.56s]  All right. I want to make sure I don't forget anything that was in these boxes. I know there
[3439.56s -> 3444.94s]  was some shit around here. That room is good to go. Here we go. Wardrobe, pills, rags.
[3445.82s -> 3452.10s]  Forget anything. I'm gonna grab the lamp just to get it over there so I don't panic later.
[3453.06s -> 3477.78s]  Ah. Ring the bell. That's also a good idea. I will do that too. I think I can just run it in there
[3477.78s -> 3485.02s]  now or at least close enough. How am I gonna get this in the room with the bear traps? I'm gonna
[3485.02s -> 3492.38s]  carefully do that now because if when it's like 17 o'clock that is not gonna happen. I will panic
[3492.38s -> 3497.02s]  and I will activate like three of the traps. There are only three traps in there so you know what I
[3497.10s -> 3520.74s]  mean. Can you help? This one is just gonna it's not gonna catch this in the trap, right?
[3535.58s -> 3564.60s]  Easy. We're good. I can stick right there. I like this setup. That's going down and then I'll put
[3564.60s -> 3576.97s]  something else up here. Any of the big furniture around here? There's got to be like a big piece
[3576.97s -> 3596.52s]  of furniture I can drag, right? Workbench. There's a wardrobe. Welder. Gentleman magazine? Bear trap.
[3596.52s -> 3600.84s]  I know the bear traps are in there. I know the bear traps are in that room. I'm talking about
[3600.84s -> 3614.23s]  for like like 35 minutes from now when I leave and come back. It's fun to decorate your house.
[3614.87s -> 3634.06s]  So this one's gonna go up because that one's gonna block that doorway. Leave. Is that gonna
[3634.06s -> 3642.55s]  be enough to block? I don't think so. No it's it's enough it's enough to be annoying though
[3642.55s -> 3651.24s]  so I can know when someone's coming in. No it's all right. That's not terrible. That's enough to
[3651.24s -> 3662.76s]  be annoying. Stop being mean to the trader. Kidding. All right I'm I'm happy with that.
[3663.40s -> 3672.06s]  I wish I could repair my shovel because that's did I get I got more nails but did I get enough
[3672.06s -> 3695.14s]  to let's see. Oh I do okay I do I do I do just no I don't. Fuck. I okay I need to use the bell.
[3695.78s -> 3711.37s]  Something's happening. I'll give you an alcohol. Do I have alcohol in my inventory? Where is he?
[3714.36s -> 3726.86s]  Front door? Back door? Oh this is big. I can pick that up. I'll move that later. Where's this guy?
[3727.90s -> 3753.08s]  I know but where are you? Kill trader. Where's the guy on the bike? I just heard his bell like twice.
[3754.04s -> 3766.31s]  Oh you're all the way out here. Uh here's some alcohol. A good vintage. Your bottle a day keeps
[3766.31s -> 3771.74s]  the monsters away to your health. I can bring you junk from the other hideout. Which hideout
[3771.74s -> 3777.42s]  should I take the junk from boss? From the silent forest. Oh on it like a fox in a trash can.
[3781.70s -> 3796.76s]  See you later. First course of action is where what did the let me look at my journal. I remember
[3796.76s -> 3805.02s]  the face face of the man who saved me. Where's um wolf? Northwestern part of the dry meadow.
[3805.82s -> 3812.86s]  It's up here. Okay so that's not that far. Let's get out of the place.
[3813.58s -> 3823.40s]  I'm gonna go do that. I do need a couple pieces of wood though to repair my shovel. I don't feel
[3823.40s -> 3834.55s]  comfortable going up there. Did I look at everything? Make sure I did. No. Note. Who the hell are they
[3834.55s -> 3841.59s]  assigning to us? Macy's fucked off from the shack. The whole night he was rambling about some merrick.
[3841.59s -> 3845.43s]  I think his younger brother or son. I don't know if it was the boredom of the stress that got to
[3845.43s -> 3852.01s]  him but he was fucking unbearable. It was the third night in a row. We tried to silence him but
[3852.01s -> 3857.77s]  it's fucking Masiak. Better not risk it. I slipped inside my sleeping bag and zipped it shut. I
[3857.77s -> 3864.17s]  prefer to suffocate in my own stench than listen to that fuckhead go on and on about it. After a
[3864.17s -> 3868.89s]  while I realized Masiak is not there anymore. He left around morning. He took all his equipment,
[3868.89s -> 3877.00s]  three liters of water, a sleeping bag, radio, gun, gasoline, flamethrower and his lucky stone. He only
[3877.00s -> 3882.20s]  left the hazard suit. We're debating on whether to report this. No one's crazy about running around
[3882.20s -> 3890.36s]  the woods looking for psycho with a flamethrower. Well we'll know who that is if we come across them.
[3893.48s -> 3901.27s]  Checking one few more little things. Any objects that I missed. I can get wood right here. Thanks
[3901.27s -> 3923.08s]  to the person in chat that told me there was wood out here. The saw needs gas. Prepare the shovel.
[3923.88s -> 3943.70s]  This is the wrong place. Chicken lady's despair. The wolf didn't want to talk to me anymore. He
[3943.70s -> 3948.81s]  grunted that he had something urgent to take care of and rushed off. If this is wall brain,
[3950.36s -> 3954.20s]  thinks that he will get rid of me so easily, then he's mistaken. He mentioned he'll be staying in
[3954.20s -> 3963.82s]  the northeastern part of the old woods. So over here. I was going up here. So he's up there.
[3964.46s -> 3974.82s]  That's not bad. Good to know. Let's get some logs. And now let me repair my shit.
[3978.90s -> 3992.04s]  Good. I should be able to repair the shovel. And then we move. We move. That's just north.
[3997.03s -> 4008.23s]  No north. I flipped it around. Wait, hold on. I um northeast. I used to I used to live in the
[4008.23s -> 4028.81s]  northeast. Don't queue. I should know what that is because I have these headphones in.
[4030.02s -> 4033.94s]  If I had both these headphones out, I could feel my brain power coming back.
[4035.62s -> 4044.66s]  It's like breathing again. When they're in, I can fucking breathe again when they're out.
[4045.30s -> 4061.46s]  Somebody just say because I'm a vegan. What the fuck are you talking about?
[4062.34s -> 4077.38s]  What does that even mean? All right. Nothing else from you that I want. Let's do it.
[4078.98s -> 4087.58s]  Workbench. Prepare the shovel. Make sure I have healing items. Good. Upgrade item. Maybe I can.
[4087.58s -> 4101.83s]  No, I can't. Take the proper healing. And we're going northeast. Bandage. Looking good. These
[4101.83s -> 4108.76s]  flares. I'm gonna sell them. Make make two bandages. Why not two? Make, you know, make another one of
[4108.76s -> 4116.57s]  these. And then another one of these. Put the welder away. I might need it for something.
[4117.53s -> 4124.70s]  We don't need the wood. We do not need this scrap metal. We do not need the weapon parts.
[4124.70s -> 4129.61s]  We do not need the we need the battery. We need one battery. I think that's sufficient. We need
[4129.61s -> 4133.05s]  the two clips. We don't need the rags anymore. Actually I do. Maybe you can. No, I don't. I got
[4133.05s -> 4140.82s]  plenty healing. Flashlight. Two. Nails. Go away. Don't need these pills. Welder. Go away. Bottle.
[4140.82s -> 4149.93s]  Alcohol. Here we go. Get rid of that bandage. I got three. Get rid of the flares. Three healing.
[4150.01s -> 4165.34s]  One battery. Two clips. Any food? No. Let's go. I'm ready. Lockpicking. You're right. Take the five
[4165.34s -> 4189.91s]  stack. And that's it. Good to go. So we're going up here northeast. Nice bangs. I'm gonna get angry.
[4190.95s -> 4222.58s]  I mean it right here. Just let's go. You guys want some Pringles? Pringles are awesome.
[4225.03s -> 4235.94s]  Actually I take that back. Original Pringles are awful. But cheese Pringles are like B tier.
[4237.70s -> 4275.03s]  I fucking can not do it. Of course this is like a poison area. Why do you even live up here for?
[4294.49s -> 4306.65s]  Road. Wait. Road. That's not where I want to go. A natural walling here. It's gonna go all the way
[4306.65s -> 4334.63s]  up. Gotta go down. Take me home. I have to go back through this shit. Slow it down. Barn ruins. Is he up
[4334.63s -> 4372.66s]  here? Dogs. Oh there's a lot of dogs. There's a lot of dogs here. A lot of them.
[4382.09s -> 4451.14s]  Is this a dog? No. Could open it with a lockpick. What the hell is going on up here? Go down here.
[4452.92s -> 4483.13s]  Hey. Shit what's with all the dogs? And what's even up here?
[4508.07s -> 4528.70s]  I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. Why are you not on a hotbar?
[4529.66s -> 4563.56s]  I don't want to shoot this gun. Everybody will know where I am. This fucking reach sucks.
[4563.56s -> 4612.12s]  Oh shit a dog is in front of me. It's two down. I thought this was going to be just a breeze to
[4612.12s -> 4631.19s]  get back up here. Okay. I think this is already to go back up there though. Let's see. First of all,
[4632.44s -> 4651.22s]  get this on the hotbar. What are you dumb? Are you fucking kidding me?
[4651.38s -> 4730.78s]  Is there nothing over here? No, there's this. Nothing. There's nothing in here.
[4731.74s -> 4747.26s]  Where the fuck am I going? Is this a person? I found him. The greeting sounds like an angry
[4747.26s -> 4751.66s]  girl. The wolf makes a quick leap and bouncing against me with his swollen belly, he puts his
[4751.66s -> 4763.51s]  paws on my shoulders. He ostentatiously licks his face. What a gift you've given me. I notice
[4763.51s -> 4768.23s]  fresh blood stains on his fur and feel streaks of his saliva dripping onto my coat. He leans
[4768.23s -> 4782.90s]  towards me as if he wanted to say something to my ear. What? The wolf squeezes my arms and starts
[4782.90s -> 4787.14s]  licking my face, once from the left side, once from the right. Comrade, meet, his breath stinks
[4787.14s -> 4790.82s]  of rot. What would I ever do without you? You're not such a worthless piece of carcass as you look.
[4790.82s -> 4798.57s]  Next to you I feel fulfilled. I've got my girl, my sweet lady. Hard to believe the same blood
[4798.57s -> 4804.98s]  flows through the veins of- I just got a rifle. This bitch reeks of chicken. What? Suddenly the
[4804.98s -> 4808.74s]  wolf sends me back with a powerful push and reaches into his coat pocket, some object hits the floor.
[4808.74s -> 4814.66s]  Here, no need to thank me. Now, since that part of the deal is behind us, I'll help you recover
[4814.66s -> 4819.30s]  your stupid key. I will take you back to the doctor's house. I'm sure you'll find some clues
[4819.30s -> 4825.22s]  on how to reach his current hideout while there. You two will have a little chat. You will get back
[4825.22s -> 4828.98s]  what you've lost and then nothing will keep you from getting the fuck out of my part of the woods.
[4828.98s -> 4833.54s]  Do you get me, meet? You will pack your bags, dive into that stinking hole of yours and
[4833.54s -> 4842.33s]  dis a fucking pier. I appreciate the dis a fucking pier. Return to the doctor's house. And are we good?
[4843.75s -> 4862.68s]  So he gave me a rifle. Are we good? I mean, I don't think so. I think I want more.
[4864.36s -> 4872.86s]  You don't got like a coupon back there for me somehow? I wonder, is the rifle any good?
[4875.30s -> 4895.14s]  Oh, are we good? Did I get it? Are we going? Huh? I can't seem to see. I need my glasses, I think.
[4895.70s -> 4905.42s]  Let's go. Wait, do I have the rifle? I had the earphones in. I'm telling you,
[4906.46s -> 4917.18s]  I don't know. There's something wrong with me. Let's go. I'm so glad I stuck that out.
[4918.41s -> 4923.13s]  I saw at least two or three people in the chat that said, get out, get out, stupid, get out, just
[4924.97s -> 4944.36s]  bad. And then they fucking almost passed out. Stupid and bad. Wait, where am I? All right. Look,
[4944.36s -> 4949.34s]  I'll agree with you. I am pretty stupid and I am pretty bad. Don't remind me. That's rude.
[4950.06s -> 4956.66s]  All right. Where am I? Where are we? Time is frozen.
[4957.54s -> 4972.78s]  I don't know why I know exactly what you're talking about. I think it's time for a change.
[4972.78s -> 4975.42s]  No more, no more faces. I'm just going to be emotionless.
[4993.19s -> 5005.64s]  I just want to see it. Where's the rifle? Hunting rifle. What kind of bolts does that take?
[5006.60s -> 5043.66s]  Medium, medium caliber. Pretty sick. Oh, geez. Bear trap, bear trap. There it was. We told you,
[5043.66s -> 5053.83s]  we told you, we told you, we told you about it. What's the single best episode of television
[5053.83s -> 5066.82s]  you've ever seen in your whole life? Good choices there. I see a couple of good choices.
[5067.62s -> 5072.90s]  Plain countryside bed. The metal buckles of the leather straps fastened to the bottom of the bed
[5072.90s -> 5090.55s]  are twisted and broken. SpongeBob pizza episode. I can't do anything with this person. Move you
[5090.55s -> 5104.78s]  out of the way. I can't move him out of the way. Go in another part of the house then.
[5108.34s -> 5129.13s]  Can't go this way. All the way around. Um, is there a door here? I can't grab this. It's dark
[5129.13s -> 5134.25s]  in here. Give me a break. It's dark. The game is dark. By its very design, the game is designed
[5134.25s -> 5151.46s]  for you not to be able to see what you're doing. The doctor? Where is the doctor? Daddy went out
[5151.46s -> 5163.48s]  and left. Angry and hungry he was. I'm hungry too. Don't get up. Can't move. Head is exploding.
[5164.12s -> 5183.72s]  And if I move, I'll burst myself. Here. No, that's not meat. Here, have some of this. Go get it.
[5183.72s -> 5200.30s]  It's delicious. Didn't want it. I tried. Partially decomposed corpse. The left hand has been
[5200.30s -> 5227.78s]  bitten off together with the arm. That's disgusting. Oh, generator. The way to keep this
[5227.78s -> 5246.62s]  stuff in time is frozen. It usually means odd stone. All right, I'll take it. Strange. Why is
[5246.62s -> 5260.30s]  this bed different when I come over? There's a way down a couple of ways down. Safe. Oh shit.
[5261.66s -> 5280.84s]  Somebody's coming in here. Maybe not. Cage. Huge empty cages. Huge empty cages.
[5281.64s -> 5299.94s]  I saved the lock to the code. I don't know the code. 8-9-8-9-9-3. Was that a code?
[5300.58s -> 5327.91s]  No, those are shoes. Destroyed. Well, destroyed at 125p. What's the code for this? Do I have a code?
[5328.55s -> 5349.88s]  Didn't go this way. Easy. I know him. Wait, this is the, this is the prologue. This is the guy.
[5350.60s -> 5380.86s]  Oh shit. Did I already open this? Um, you guys told me there was only one person that ate people
[5380.86s -> 5421.21s]  in this game. Ice? Rotten mushroom. What do I do? How do I take this stuff? Okay. Battery. No. I have
[5421.21s -> 5434.50s]  to get back. This is worth a lot of money. This doesn't do anything. Thanks for wait, thanks for
[5434.50s -> 5458.98s]  not letting me waste time. I mean, I still want the ice though. Cooking ice. You can't cook it.
[5458.98s -> 5462.84s]  Cook the ice. I'll take one stack. I've never seen it before. I don't know what it does.
[5463.56s -> 5487.50s]  All right, that's fine. Outside. Uh, can I jump this? I cannot. Nothing else over here.
[5488.14s -> 5523.90s]  This is fucked up. This game is fucked up. I need a code. That's not shoe. Those are not shoes.
[5525.85s -> 5544.89s]  That's one five one five nine four one five four nine. I had the right idea with the shoes.
[5544.89s -> 5568.70s]  Just wrong place. One nine. What was it? Nine one nine one nine five four one nine. So that's not
[5568.70s -> 5579.27s]  a one. This is just a five five four nine. That's not 15. Okay. That's just the piece here. Five four
[5579.35s -> 5626.10s]  nine. One nine. What's the other number? One five four nine. Photo. It's over. It's somewhere else,
[5626.10s -> 5629.86s]  Mr. Stupid. Zero viewers. Everybody left. They couldn't handle me looking at this. Like they
[5629.86s -> 5635.22s]  couldn't take me trying to find the safe code and they all took off. All of them. Uh, this is a photo.
[5638.73s -> 5668.17s]  Eight five five four nine eight. Let's try that. Five four eight nine five eight four five nine.
[5669.05s -> 5694.86s]  There it is. Map code toy. Doctor's note with a code. The code to the cart door. 8909. 8909. Remember
[5694.86s -> 5703.42s]  that. Note with a code. Okay. The map shows the location of some train. Train wreck. And then a
[5703.42s -> 5749.61s]  toy. Okay. I got my heel ready. I gotta get the fuck out of here. Free wood. Trees blocked the way
[5749.61s -> 5786.23s]  ahead. So what the hell? Map? I can't use a map. Map. Map. I can't do that. Use a map. What? I can't
[5786.23s -> 5792.33s]  do that. I could probably just leave. Do I have to leave just all the way out? I think I did
[5792.33s -> 5802.36s]  everything I can. Wait. What about down here? I don't think I looked down here yet. There's
[5802.36s -> 5820.25s]  not much to see anyway. So. All right. I'm just gonna leave. Yep. Time to go. He's too strong
[5820.25s -> 5834.90s]  to dismantle. Come on. We are out of here. My, my house also burst in half. Everything here just
[5834.90s -> 5841.74s]  bursts. This person's freaking me out. I think they're gonna get up and chase me and shit.
[5842.38s -> 5845.94s]  I shouldn't. It's gonna be a scenario where I should have just killed him.
[5846.66s -> 5861.46s]  Hey, you here? Are you good? Kill me. Take my house. My cracked hut.
[5862.10s -> 5873.61s]  Where do you live? Where do you live? Where do you live? Oh no. Where do you live?
[5874.57s -> 5934.14s]  Okay. Rusty key. Like where? I don't know where you live. Oh, these mushrooms rotted because
[5934.14s -> 5941.30s]  they took too long in here. Fuck. Are they worth anything? I got an axe. How does it swing?
[5942.02s -> 5948.30s]  Pretty nicely. Oh, pretty nice actually. I don't even need to build the damn thing.
[5949.10s -> 5961.98s]  I have an axe head. I can just sell it back. Oh, I can upgrade the axe. Holy shit. Now this is
[5961.98s -> 5979.03s]  getting interesting. This thing's going to be insane. Hell yeah. All right. So I got, let me
[5979.03s -> 5984.65s]  look at this. I've explored the doctor's house. It's a complete ruin. Now I know that what seemed
[5984.65s -> 5989.21s]  like nightly terrors is very real. Still don't know how I escaped this place. I suspect someone
[5989.21s -> 5995.80s]  must have carried me out. I found some code in the doctor's house. I don't know what it's
[5995.80s -> 6003.91s]  for, but I hope it opens the door to his current hideout. So I have the doctor's hideout. Go back
[6003.91s -> 6027.42s]  to the tub. Check tub. Under the tub. Check under the tub. Rub-a-dub-dub. What's under the tub?
[6028.14s -> 6050.34s]  You're supposed to be helping me. This is what I think of your little tub joke.
[6050.82s -> 6061.06s]  I didn't break the tub. I broke the door and almost destroyed the shovel.
[6066.81s -> 6070.17s]  Mean chat. Well, sorry. Look, sometimes I look over here and it's like,
[6070.97s -> 6078.65s]  holy shit. Read chat. You stupid idiot. You're so stupid. How could you not do this? And then
[6078.73s -> 6092.39s]  that's a lie. But other times I can't see the word going on the screen. So it's hard
[6092.39s -> 6105.53s]  to determine. Like, he's blind. He's an idiot. Oh, the word was going not good if you just read it.
[6106.09s -> 6110.81s]  But then you guys can, because I know I do that, you guys can get me so easily with shit like that.
[6112.01s -> 6123.46s]  Let's put it this way. You guys are a coin flip if you're legit or not. Why is it? Why did the
[6123.46s -> 6132.28s]  time change? All right. Where the hell am I? Where am I? Where did I just end up? Okay, right here.
[6133.40s -> 6138.55s]  Back to the house. I'm not. No, no, no. Gun. I don't care. Give me the gun.
[6143.14s -> 6150.62s]  It didn't hit. Pretty good dodge, I'll tell you. But I don't have time. Rotten mushroom's not worth
[6150.62s -> 6177.59s]  anything, right? Yes, I know. It was a good dodge. Stupid, bald, manlit idiot. Why are you guys so
[6177.59s -> 6185.50s]  mean? All right. Imagine, okay. Imagine if every time somebody said something in this chat that was
[6186.54s -> 6192.90s]  even remotely anything. You could say anything. Imagine if I referred to some of you guys as,
[6192.90s -> 6200.10s]  oh, hey. Hey, what's up, you bald, manlit idiot? How you guys doing today? You're all bald,
[6200.10s -> 6205.66s]  manlit morons. How you guys doing? Don't you think? Don't you think you'd kind of be like,
[6206.95s -> 6221.91s]  hey, hey, what? That was a little rude. All right, I'm gonna fuck this up. Just go down.
[6222.47s -> 6234.31s]  I'm out of gas. Just keep the gun out. He's yelling it. No, I'm not. Sometimes I think it's funny.
[6239.10s -> 6252.30s]  This is why I've kept the gun out. Let me try the axe. Imagine you went to work and your boss
[6252.30s -> 6262.17s]  greets you at the door. At the door. Okay, I don't want to die. Guys, I'm gonna die.
[6264.25s -> 6275.85s]  I'm dead. There's fucking three dogs here. Again, two of you came out of nowhere. Two people from
[6275.85s -> 6291.46s]  chat. Why are these open? Why are these, why are these open? Why are these undone? What the fuck
[6291.46s -> 6299.53s]  happened? I'm sorry. Yeah, two dogs just literally just spawned out of nowhere and a third one came
[6299.53s -> 6304.98s]  and killed me. Why are these open? This is, this is horrible. Actually, this is terrible.
[6305.62s -> 6311.80s]  This is awful. Why are these open? Why are these? I don't understand why these have been
[6312.52s -> 6320.86s]  done. Did somebody come in here? What I was going to say is imagine you like went into work and you
[6320.86s -> 6327.75s]  boss the first thing in the morning. I'm gonna pause it for this. You walk in. Oh, hey. Oh, hey,
[6327.75s -> 6337.22s]  hey, boss. Hey, you bald manlit idiot. That motherfucker is getting sued for like harassment.
[6340.34s -> 6351.30s]  Can you imagine that like instant lawsuit? It'd be fucking immediate. Did I lose my rifle?
[6351.30s -> 6360.09s]  Oh, I'm gonna do everything possible to get that back. No, I still have it. Okay, I'm gonna get my
[6360.09s -> 6382.09s]  stuff though. Why were those traps open? That's a bug. All right, get rid of this shit. I don't
[6382.09s -> 6388.60s]  even, I can't even use this stuff anymore. Store the hunting rifle for now. I need battery.
[6389.91s -> 6396.68s]  Don't scrap metal. That sucks. Why is it? Why did they do that? That's actually aggravating.
[6398.84s -> 6406.55s]  I died, so it activated two of my traps. All right. Oh, fuck off. I don't, I am not ready to take
[6406.55s -> 6418.39s]  off his stuff right now. I don't have time for this. I have to go get my stuff. Did he come in
[6418.39s -> 6450.60s]  here and step on the traps? I don't have time for this shit. Every single individual item needs to
[6450.60s -> 6472.70s]  be ration stamps. What the fuck is this? Give me a break. I have no idea what to do here.
[6473.50s -> 6483.02s]  Take these. Put them here. I'm gonna take the gas out. Put the shovel back. Nails. I mean,
[6483.02s -> 6492.30s]  just combine them. Why are they not auto-combined? What the hell? Anything else? Get rid of these
[6492.30s -> 6497.02s]  bottles. I don't even know what this rear view mirror is for. I'm afraid to delete any of these
[6497.02s -> 6504.41s]  items. I feel like I'm gonna need them. Where are those? Take one of these. Take these bottles out.
[6504.97s -> 6528.04s]  Make a few more healing things. What? What? Use the auto-combine key.
[6530.68s -> 6538.09s]  Phone on me. I'm gonna throw this off a cliff. I'm literally throwing this off a cliff, the next
[6538.09s -> 6544.20s]  cliff I come to. This thing is going, I'm going to throw this as fucking hard as I can over the
[6544.36s -> 6562.26s]  horizon. Okay, torch. I'm just gonna bring it. I can't combine that. This rotten meat is useless.
[6562.26s -> 6569.61s]  I'm gonna cook this stuff right now. I can't believe that those traps aren't there. There's
[6569.61s -> 6598.30s]  still one. All right, let's go. Oh shit, okay. I can make like gas bombs? That's pretty ridiculous.
[6601.35s -> 6605.99s]  Metal pipe. I'll take the bottles with me. Whipping this off the cliff as hard as I can.
[6606.87s -> 6614.58s]  And let's do another lockpick. Here we go. Let's do
[6616.82s -> 6628.42s]  bear trap. Upgrade item. Let me look at this. I need eight scrap for a greatly increased weapon
[6628.42s -> 6635.42s]  durability. That scared the shit out of me. Holy fuck. Why is that so much louder than the game?
[6635.98s -> 6647.27s]  All right, I gotta get out of here. Store this for now. I need to go get my stuff
[6648.15s -> 6655.37s]  before it gets too late. All right, I have, where's my axe?
[6662.01s -> 6666.33s]  Fucking god, that's fine. All right, get me the fuck out of here. I gotta get my stuff.
[6666.89s -> 6670.73s]  It's right next to the house. I can't believe I died there.
[6671.77s -> 6680.63s]  Oh, hold on. Fucking full moon. This has been a full moon chat the last three days.
[6681.51s -> 6687.91s]  Have you guys been drinking shit under the sink? What are you doing?
[6695.16s -> 6703.74s]  All right, don't, I can't fuck this. I need my stuff. I, I know, I'm gonna get to those bits,
[6703.74s -> 6712.54s]  but I, it's 15 o'clock right now and I can't fuck this up. I don't remember where the hell that was.
[6713.94s -> 6740.70s]  Oh, you piece of shit. You are so, what? Fucking hell. Oh, where's my bag?
[6741.50s -> 6756.09s]  Crate? Oh, there's, no. Oh, I just found my stuff. Did anybody remember where it was?
[6756.73s -> 6768.46s]  It was like over here somewhere, right? What? I don't have time for you. Somebody can't,
[6768.46s -> 6793.08s]  I don't have time for you. It's under the tub. Where's that? There it is. I got no more bullets.
[6793.08s -> 6816.90s]  This is a horrendous scenario. Leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave. I made it.
[6819.06s -> 6834.82s]  Woo. Oh, fuck. You guys are fucking with me. You guys are like, fuck with my head.
[6838.92s -> 6848.46s]  All right. You broke them. You got, all right. They were, 5,000 bits came in from phylactery
[6848.46s -> 6854.60s]  lidge. Thank you. First of all, that moment's going to be forever remembered because you have
[6854.60s -> 6859.85s]  a face cam. It's all right. It don't matter. Uh, Hey, Jeremiah, I'm glad you're streaming
[6859.85s -> 6865.21s]  cause I had a pretty bad day at work today. I got to work and said, Hey boss. And he called me a bald
[6865.61s -> 6877.27s]  idiot. It really hurt my feelings. Do you think I have a case for harassment? Yes. Yes. Absolutely.
[6877.91s -> 6900.98s]  100%. Oh, you guys are fucking too much. Thank you for the 5,000 bits. Oh wait, I forgot. I have
[6900.98s -> 6908.70s]  to do this before it becomes too dark out. I have it in my inventory, right? Yeah. Get it out of here.
[6912.50s -> 6923.27s]  Watch this. I'm just going to whip this shit into the woods here. Oh, what's that?
[6925.43s -> 6956.04s]  Something's going to chase me. It's a body of precious bone. Okay. 17 o'clock.
[6957.02s -> 6969.10s]  Oh, this is such a mess. This is a mess in here. I'm just going to make these until I can't make
[6969.10s -> 6982.55s]  them anymore. I have like toxic fumes now. Okay. I'm going to make these bear trap. I can only make
[6982.55s -> 6994.58s]  one bear trap. This sucks. What a disaster. What a disaster. I have healing here. Don't need the
[6994.58s -> 6999.94s]  lock picks right now. I have to, I'll do this tomorrow. I need to repair. Do I have Canada?
[6999.94s -> 7007.18s]  I can't repair this. I need to scrap. Not good. That's all right. I don't have any bullets either.
[7007.18s -> 7020.12s]  Yes, I do. I have one. I'm going to piss my pants. Okay. Where's my wood? Make sure everything's
[7020.12s -> 7030.81s]  boarded up. Get these bottles out of here. I have reorganized this shit tomorrow. I just don't,
[7030.81s -> 7035.77s]  I don't know what to do with it all. I'm going to fill the generator. I've got my axe and I
[7035.77s -> 7040.01s]  have a full clip and now that has to blast me. That has to blast me till tomorrow. That's just
[7040.01s -> 7059.62s]  all there is to it. Let's go. Can I cook anything else? No. Chad is a vicious mob. I'm telling you,
[7059.62s -> 7077.35s]  people don't think the full moon shit is real. It's not. You sure? What time is it where you are?
[7077.35s -> 7081.67s]  Look out the window. There's a full, if there's a full moon and okay, if you look out the window
[7081.67s -> 7086.47s]  and there's a full moon and the last sentence you wrote in chat was like peepee, poopoo, bald,
[7086.47s -> 7100.57s]  mad streamer. I'm just saying it might have something to do with it. I need to move. Watch
[7100.57s -> 7109.64s]  out. Watch out. Watch out. I need to board. I don't have time for this. Oh, I'm so screwed here.
[7116.89s -> 7121.37s]  That's at least closed. I'm not in the room though. I'm not in the room. I have to get in the
[7121.37s -> 7136.87s]  room. Get in the room. 19. Ow, my hand. Good. This is blocked. There's a trap there already.
[7137.85s -> 7151.56s]  Close this door. Board it. Okay. This trap is going right here. Right like in front of me.
[7155.06s -> 7157.78s]  Because if somebody comes in this way, they'll get hit by it. Somebody comes in this way.
[7158.50s -> 7162.50s]  I don't know. It's this way. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know
[7162.50s -> 7199.14s]  where to put this. Should I put it right here? Not yet. I have the scream still. He looks strange
[7199.14s -> 7207.08s]  today. Come on into work. How are you? Good to see you again. Good to see you again, Dick.
[7207.08s -> 7219.70s]  You look strange today. Okay. Bald idiot. I'm going to go to my desk. Yeah. Idiot. Bald head.
[7220.26s -> 7225.94s]  I can hear him still screaming. And he's just sitting there. He's sitting there with like
[7226.58s -> 7241.26s]  under the sink cleaner in his hand. Bald. Whoa. This is fucked up. And then he goes,
[7241.74s -> 7248.97s]  oh, there's a fucking full moon behind him. Okay. I don't want to die. I don't want to die.
[7269.46s -> 7307.46s]  It's been one hour. Can't do it. You can't do it. Uh oh. I got a good dent. What's that sound?
[7307.46s -> 7314.42s]  Oh no. Don't put, don't put the gas in here. Don't put it right under me. Don't put it right
[7314.42s -> 7329.59s]  under me. If you put it right under me, I'm going to lose. Dog is just like smashing his head.
[7331.67s -> 7343.78s]  Eventually, maybe you'll get it. Um, what happens if the ghosts come and turn the light off?
[7354.58s -> 7359.22s]  What's that? Why is there a nuke in the house? Why is there a nuke in the house?
[7360.42s -> 7365.94s]  I don't know what that is. What does that mean? Why is there a nuke in the house?
[7368.55s -> 7375.99s]  Where is it and what is it? Something's trying to move this container and it has not successful
[7375.99s -> 7394.31s]  yet. Hello? What is in the house? What is in the house? I need to heal. I need to heal.
[7396.90s -> 7408.12s]  This motherfucker moves around the house. Get out of that room. Get out of that room. It's trapped.
[7408.68s -> 7419.38s]  Oh fuck. No, no. Move the, move the pre-hero. Please. It's 5 30. It's almost time. It's almost,
[7419.38s -> 7432.57s]  hey, hey, come on. It's almost time for work, Gerber. What was that? My house just shook.
[7456.94s -> 7460.30s]  I was trying to go around this way. No.
[7460.30s -> 7499.96s]  No. I got halfway through that and I realized, stop. That's what happened to my brain.
[7500.60s -> 7507.24s]  In my mind, it was, I got halfway through and it, I, my brain went, stop. Don't do that. Stop it.
[7507.80s -> 7521.50s]  I want to see that clip. I want to see how fucking embarrassing that was.
[7522.38s -> 7528.90s]  I need to know. This is why I don't do face cam. It's like turd alert is coming up here.
[7529.86s -> 7556.97s]  That wasn't even it. That's not, it's a baby. That's not, that's not, that's a baby. This is not it.
[7556.97s -> 7565.80s]  Leave. Leave. Leave. What the fuck are you looking this for? It sounds like a baby.
[7569.75s -> 7580.73s]  That's, god damn it. I hate it. I hate it. I hate this. I hate this.
[7581.45s -> 7592.81s]  Oh, I hate this. This image over here. Oh, I hate this. I'm fucking, I'm never streaming again.
[7592.81s -> 7607.91s]  This is the last stream ever. I'm going to go hide for the rest of my life. Got fired. All right.
[7607.91s -> 7623.50s]  Let's keep going. Turn off the generator. I made it. I made it. I, I tried, I, but give me a little
[7623.50s -> 7633.22s]  bit slack. I didn't, I don't know what that thing was. This red sun glowing nuclear bomb
[7633.22s -> 7636.82s]  just appeared in my room. I'm going to panic a little. I don't know what that is.
[7638.26s -> 7652.20s]  Imagine ending your career by a wooing. Imagine that really is the last thing I ever do.
[7652.92s -> 7661.51s]  No, we got a Halloween stream to do it. That's not going to happen. All right.
[7661.99s -> 7681.06s]  Ahem. Train wreck. I had a note to go to the train wreck. Anything cool planned for Halloween
[7681.06s -> 7686.74s]  this year? Yeah. This is going to be an incredibly elaborate stream. Me versus you. Secret slime
[7686.74s -> 7690.26s]  actions. You're going to try to slime me by, I'll go over it again at the end of the stream. It's
[7690.26s -> 7694.74s]  going to be a, it's going to be a whole thing. Oh, that's right. Like a bunch of people are here.
[7695.38s -> 7699.22s]  Long story short, there's going to be a channel in the discord that's going to be opened up
[7699.22s -> 7703.86s]  for you to give suggestions on secret slime actions from me that I do not know about.
[7704.18s -> 7706.42s]  There's going to be a discussion channel and there's going to be a suggestion channel.
[7706.42s -> 7709.94s]  Discussion channels for discussion. Suggestions for one sentence on what you think it should be.
[7709.94s -> 7714.34s]  Bingo. No discussion in that channel. By the way, at the 30th, the October 31st,
[7714.34s -> 7716.82s]  that's when it's probably going to happen. You're the 30th, 31st. One of those days,
[7716.82s -> 7721.70s]  I'll give you a good hard concrete one. But me versus you, you also have slime actions as well
[7721.70s -> 7725.22s]  because we're going to come up with some stuff that you're not allowed to write in the chat.
[7725.22s -> 7727.94s]  And it's a competition because if you write something that you're not supposed to write
[7727.94s -> 7732.42s]  you don't know about, then you are banned from that game and you lose points as a collective chat.
[7733.38s -> 7745.08s]  Boom. A wooing is going to be on there. That's fine. You'll know. I'll never do that again.
[7745.96s -> 7749.48s]  This is the first and last time you will ever see me or hear me do that. Do not suggest
[7750.04s -> 7756.36s]  the awoo as a thing to do on that stream because it will never happen again. I promise.
[7757.72s -> 7766.17s]  I 100% guarantee you that I will never turn and do the cookie crisp howl because that's what it's
[7766.17s -> 7774.62s]  in my head. Every time I've gone, the thing, I'm just thinking of cookie crisp every time.
[7774.62s -> 7784.97s]  I've done it like probably 10 times in my life. You still have to spin. I did. You didn't see me
[7784.97s -> 7798.94s]  go around a circle? Do it again. No. Okay. Okay. Okay. I got all the time in the world now.
[7799.98s -> 7809.16s]  I need to get this set up. So first things first, there are nuclear bombs now. Good to know.
[7809.96s -> 7816.92s]  Second things first, go to the trader. Third thing is second, sell the items that I want to get rid
[7816.92s -> 7833.54s]  of. Always pick up the items that I know I need that I want. And that includes rags, wood, battery,
[7834.34s -> 7859.91s]  magazine, mushroom, medium caliber bullet. Right? That's for the rifle. Right? He shakes his head.
[7859.91s -> 7865.59s]  Why not? Oh, because he wants something in return. These things are worth a lot of money.
[7867.26s -> 7872.42s]  I don't know. Should I give you an odd stone? These do anything? Don't ignore Jerma Wu.
[7872.42s -> 7889.75s]  Well, I'm going to ignore it because I just didn't ignore. All right. So don't give the stone.
[7890.47s -> 7899.93s]  Guys. Here, you can have a few eggs. No, that's too many eggs. You can have like one here.
[7900.89s -> 7907.21s]  You know, it's okay. So let's do a little bit of a thing here. Let me go. I'm time for a true,
[7908.33s -> 7912.09s]  get rid of the shit that you don't need. This is a closet cleaning stream.
[7913.93s -> 7936.28s]  Closet cleaning stream starts now. Cook. Don't touch that. I can't. I mean, I can't believe
[7936.28s -> 7948.07s]  because I was under a lot of stress. Gasoline. Fruit on the ground. Where is it? Gasoline.
[7950.04s -> 7957.48s]  Gasoline. Backseat the fuck out of me right now. What is this for?
[7972.95s -> 8001.99s]  You can eat it for health. Is it? What is this? Let's get some twos. Hey, look at that. That's
[8001.99s -> 8039.82s]  pretty good. We might be able to get a yahtzee. Get some. You know what you're like going to go
[8039.82s -> 8048.04s]  back in time and stop your past self from doing something. I'm going to go back and just be like,
[8048.04s -> 8061.72s]  don't do that. Do not howl ever again. All right. So jars of meat. You did it three times.
[8062.68s -> 8070.62s]  Yeah. Okay. So I'm me now is going to go back in time to tell me from like three months ago to
[8070.62s -> 8075.34s]  don't howl. Don't do it. This is why I use the time machine. I've done it three times today.
[8078.95s -> 8088.74s]  What? I have a shiny stone. All right. Let me, let me first of all, military flashlight is going to
[8088.74s -> 8098.98s]  replace regular flashlight. I think maybe I need to get these scissors for whatever they are.
[8101.11s -> 8110.65s]  Toy. Oh, okay. Flip. This is where we really just dump everything. I'm like, I'm like 20 minutes
[8110.65s -> 8122.44s]  till I'm like 15 to 20 minutes to complete in the game. So toy cell. Okay. Welder.
[8123.32s -> 8136.26s]  Sell. Wedding ring. Sell it. Torch. Sell it. Chicken head. Sell it.
[8138.60s -> 8162.49s]  Welder. Sell it. Okay. Dermot, there are two chapters. You're in chapter one.
[8169.70s -> 8180.23s]  Acid just got in my eyes. Welder. Welder. Wedding ring. $50. You should play Hitman some more.
[8181.13s -> 8185.61s]  Says Phylacter Lich with 5,000 bits. Play Hitman some more. I actually did see this
[8185.61s -> 8192.36s]  gift today of the flying helicopter briefcase on the guy with the, I have seen this. It's a
[8192.36s -> 8197.48s]  fucking lot of money. That's a hundred dollars now from Phylactery. Holy shit. You're still giving
[8197.48s -> 8203.26s]  money. Dev's never intended a player to take this many days. Well, that's funny because
[8204.70s -> 8208.65s]  I just was curious and looked up how many days typical did people have when they did their first
[8208.65s -> 8213.37s]  blind playthrough. And typically speaking, it's like 30 to 40 days is what I've seen.
[8213.37s -> 8218.57s]  So you just, I just had a legit research project that could back that up. Um, it used to make
[8218.57s -> 8223.21s]  about 30 plus days for your first playthroughs, but I've been told I don't appreciate that.
[8223.85s -> 8234.38s]  By the way, I howl at people that do stuff like that. You don't want the toy, but Phylactery,
[8234.38s -> 8238.84s]  thank you so much. Hitman is done though. Unfortunately. Oh, I think I got everything
[8238.84s -> 8244.54s]  I wanted out of it. It's a fantastic fucking game. I love every second of that game,
[8245.50s -> 8253.11s]  but I'm not going to be playing Hitman 2 anymore. I've done it all. I'm gonna, okay.
[8254.09s -> 8266.62s]  So that should be good. Give me your scrap metal. I want to upgrade this axe blade, but can I do
[8266.62s -> 8282.78s]  another upgrade here? Impossible. I gotta go back in my inventory. Play Blood Money. Well, I mean,
[8282.78s -> 8288.04s]  I could play some of the old ones, but not at the moment. Not right now. All right, back down here.
[8288.04s -> 8301.82s]  The axe. The axe needs axe head and four more scrap to do the big upgrade,
[8302.46s -> 8305.98s]  which I think I'll probably be taking that to the end of the game if I were curious.
[8308.66s -> 8321.61s]  Shovel. I think it's time for the shovel to leave. I think the shovel, its time is up. It was really
[8321.61s -> 8331.86s]  good. It helped. Goodbye shovel. Thank you for everything. Thank you for everything. Um,
[8331.94s -> 8348.57s]  making another one of these. Homemade shotgun. Do I have the shotgun? I do. Useless after fire.
[8348.57s -> 8353.05s]  I need to use this on something. I don't know what the hell to use it on. All right, so we got,
[8353.61s -> 8360.74s]  take the wood out, put the nails back, take the lock picks out, put these shiny stones in. The
[8360.74s -> 8367.54s]  bottles do not have a purpose for me anymore. What's the difference between the heel pills
[8367.54s -> 8382.30s]  and just the regular pills? What do these do? Do these do anything? This is for stamina.
[8382.54s -> 8387.22s]  Okay, well I'm just gonna, I'm gonna burn through them. Toy, I can't do anything with it yet.
[8387.22s -> 8391.54s]  Battery, I can't do anything with it. Is, I feel like battery, I already did what I needed with the
[8391.54s -> 8400.33s]  battery. Do I need to keep it? I'm gonna sell the flares. Bottle of gas, which stacks at three.
[8400.33s -> 8408.49s]  Unfortunately, yes. Rear view mirror, like these things, they're not, they don't have a purpose
[8408.49s -> 8424.82s]  anymore. And these are heels. So I'll take a couple of these, one of these with me. Okay,
[8424.90s -> 8432.79s]  stacks of two, bring the clip with me, put the rope back here. I have, where's my hunting rifle?
[8432.79s -> 8447.22s]  The new one, where is it? Where is it? Where's the rifle? Where's the rifle? Where's the rifle? There it
[8447.22s -> 8453.94s]  is. Looks like a toothbrush. All right, I'm gonna keep the bullet with the rifle. I'm not gonna use
[8453.94s -> 8461.48s]  it yet. I feel like I'm gonna need that end game. Weapons supposed to go up top. Batteries I need
[8461.48s -> 8468.97s]  to take for the flashlight. I'll eat the eggs on this trip. I have heels. Bottle, get rid of.
[8468.97s -> 8475.13s]  All right, somebody stop me. Somebody stop me right now. What is selling is getting rid of the
[8475.13s -> 8493.54s]  mirror. He doesn't want any of it. Okay. I have my axe, 50%. I have a clip. All right, let's go
[8493.54s -> 8501.24s]  back down one more time. Let me turn these into wooden planks. Do I have any gas? I might buy
[8501.24s -> 8505.08s]  another gas because I'm probably, I'm gonna fill it up. Let's fill it up, the whole thing.
[8505.88s -> 8521.05s]  I've got three batteries. Good. Back and I forgot to pee. I had to go really bad. It's okay. I can
[8521.05s -> 8537.66s]  wait. All right, let me bring the gas. Go to the bathroom now. I will before I go up for the next
[8537.66s -> 8561.51s]  adventure. I'm so sorry I just smashed you in the head. This is, I'm gonna do a full tank in here
[8561.51s -> 8569.02s]  and a full tank, fill up the generator over here as well. And then I'm gonna buy a gas can from
[8569.74s -> 8590.22s]  Mr. Trader over here. I'm going to cook, right? I am so happy that they decided that this game
[8590.86s -> 8597.96s]  was going to not have a time go right now. If the timer was going on right now, this would be
[8599.78s -> 8619.74s]  horrible. It would be so horrible. Pee? I'll pee like tomorrow. All right, we're good. Let's go
[8619.74s -> 8626.92s]  back and put the gas in. He's gonna have to do the ah-ooh during the green screen stream.
[8626.92s -> 8633.00s]  That is the only other place that I will do it. Because that's not, that, yeah. I'll do, I will do
[8633.00s -> 8640.62s]  that again. A full, like a full cookie crisp. I promise. And I'm gonna do it as hard as I can.
[8641.18s -> 8664.46s]  All right, how much is this? 68. I'll just buy one. Take these bottles. All right, back to what I was
[8664.46s -> 8670.76s]  just doing. Don't give us this kind of power. Well, those of you that were not here the last
[8670.76s -> 8680.90s]  time I did this, how that stream works and how that this whole thing is gonna work is I, you
[8680.90s -> 8685.70s]  are going to put, if you want to participate, you're gonna put suggestions on what you want
[8685.70s -> 8693.88s]  me to do in front of a full, like 100, like 50 foot long and like 100 foot tall green screen.
[8695.46s -> 8701.40s]  Anything. It could be anything. So when people are talking about doing a woo in front of the
[8701.40s -> 8706.60s]  greens, we're like, that's what they're referring to. And then everybody makes this shit. They spend,
[8707.72s -> 8714.76s]  why am I here? They spend a bunch of time and a bunch of talent. Very talented people in this
[8714.76s -> 8726.20s]  community make very, very interesting things from those green screen clips. All right, what was I
[8726.20s -> 8735.35s]  doing here? Right. Wood. I got this 10. Okay. I got to organize for a second. Scrap metal can go back.
[8736.15s -> 8743.82s]  Hills are going to stay here. I'm going to eat these. This is for health. Battery. I don't,
[8743.82s -> 8753.91s]  like, don't know what the fuck to do with this stuff. I already have three. Lockpicks. All right,
[8753.91s -> 8759.91s]  I think my inventory is good to go. I'm going to do this just so my brain understands, right? I
[8759.91s -> 8765.43s]  need my brain to know what this shit is here for, right? So it's going to be whatever is in the slot.
[8765.43s -> 8771.45s]  That row is going to be related to that. So for instance, acts first row, we've got,
[8772.33s -> 8777.61s]  I don't know, lockpick and watch because that's like you've stuck your hold and it's on your hands.
[8778.78s -> 8791.70s]  Battery and don't matter. It could be anything. Battery and meat. Gun. I guess
[8792.66s -> 8799.37s]  uh, that system doesn't work. So I'm just going to, who cares? All right, I'm ready.
[8801.32s -> 8809.50s]  I need four more scrap. Make sure I get some. I'm ready to go. The thing I'm going to do now is
[8809.50s -> 8821.42s]  I'm going to go from here. I have to go to this train wreck. Wake up now. I'll be all right. The
[8821.42s -> 8825.74s]  pill in the hot bar. You know, that's what I should die. That's what I'm glad to have you guys around
[8826.38s -> 8832.94s]  because that just frees up space and that's a heal. That's a stamina. I'm just, this is why,
[8832.94s -> 8837.18s]  this is why I make sure that I have like some fucking smart people around me surrounded by them.
[8838.78s -> 8844.06s]  I mean, like you're not surrounding me. There's a ton of you are just like locked in a cube right
[8844.06s -> 8852.71s]  here and I can just look over there. So I'm not technically not surrounded. All right, time. I
[8852.71s -> 9087.32s]  gotta pee. I will do that. I'll be right back. Hey, how are you? Good to be back. All right.
[9088.04s -> 9091.98s]  Hey, German cube genius here. Be sure to regularly check your...
[9093.10s -> 9127.05s]  Is that the new Bane? All right, I'm ready to go. No, I said, oh, like I hit my hand. How bright is
[9127.05s -> 9135.72s]  this? Oh shit, that's awesome. All right, I'm ready. Expedition East. We're going to the train wreck
[9139.29s -> 9150.70s]  and here we go. Collecting things along the way. Not rocks because they don't, I hate them.
[9153.93s -> 9160.15s]  Is this the same shit that I wore last time? No, this is like purple v-neck. I didn't wear this.
[9160.15s -> 9170.74s]  I, no. Holy shit, this flashlight is amazing. Why did I not take this? All right, train wreck.
[9171.46s -> 9188.33s]  Don't want to use it too often though. All right, be ready. What have we got? Hunter's house. All
[9188.33s -> 9214.30s]  right, that's a big gun. What the hell was that? Got to check it out, you know.
[9220.62s -> 9257.29s]  Best item in the whole fucking game. Fair trap. Anybody in here? Yeah, there is. One of those
[9257.29s -> 9277.19s]  things. I'm going to make them block up the trap. Fuck it. Fuck it. No, no, no, no. Fuck it. Fuck
[9277.19s -> 9284.20s]  it. Fuck it. Watch this. No, fuck it. Does this blow up in your hand? Does this blow up in your
[9284.20s -> 9298.79s]  hand? Does this blow up in your hand? Does this blow up in your hand? Oh shit, I'm on fire. I'm
[9298.79s -> 9315.34s]  on fire. How do I take the fire off? How do I take the fire off? Eat the pills quick. No, I just
[9315.34s -> 9324.14s]  watched Ryan look at what it does and how long it's on for. Oh, I hate it. Why did I do this?
[9325.18s -> 9349.16s]  Turns out that was a terrible idea. Now, I wanted to see like if it stayed, how long it stayed on
[9349.16s -> 9354.81s]  you for. And while I'm doing that, I'm like moving this way. Oh, for the love of God. Hopefully,
[9354.81s -> 9379.75s]  there's not two of those in here. There probably is. I hear like gurgling sounds. Stuffed links.
[9380.79s -> 9392.97s]  Can't wait. What? There's nothing here. Don't, please don't pop up. I got an important message.
[9392.97s -> 9403.91s]  Please read. Neck. Hey, let's see me at 35. I don't know why he would like read that.
[9404.55s -> 9428.07s]  I whip out the gun for this because these guys suck. Trophy. Oh shit, found a trophy.
[9435.70s -> 9455.69s]  Holy shit, he's alive still. Okay, take the gun out. I didn't know. I didn't know. What's this?
[9455.69s -> 9468.47s]  A photo of a dog eating something in a magazine. I can't really use the axe anymore. One more hit
[9468.47s -> 9483.42s]  of the axe and it's gonna be destroyed. Start using moisturizer. I, I do every single day.
[9486.02s -> 9499.99s]  I'm not gonna read any more of those. Something is still like clicking and clacking.
[9500.63s -> 9521.70s]  Oh, I can make armor again. Wait, let me see. Let me change what I got on.
[9523.03s -> 9533.77s]  Uh, forget about, who cares about the wire. I can make armor. The tube. Like, no, it's fine.
[9533.77s -> 9543.18s]  It's all right. All right. Anything else back here? No. I think I've looted this whole house.
[9543.98s -> 9552.26s]  There's a place to go to the right. But have I gone over here? Let me just check this. I have,
[9552.26s -> 9558.65s]  I don't know. I have not gone this way and this is blocked. I can't move it so I have to go up
[9558.65s -> 9574.47s]  and around. But there's plaques. What the hell is making, there's a lot of traps in here.
[9574.55s -> 9590.44s]  What is making that noise? What the fuck? There's so many traps right here. Wow. No room in inventory.
[9590.44s -> 9606.01s]  Well, that has to change. Get rid of the, oh, the nails, the wood. Search the traps.
[9614.38s -> 9639.18s]  This is everything I wanted. I'm getting rid of the eggs. Eggs and alcohol. Eggs and nails.
[9639.66s -> 9655.90s]  I'm so glad I came in here. This is the exact thing I needed. A bunch of scrap and traps.
[9655.90s -> 9664.17s]  Bunch of scrap and traps. Is it all in good fun? I hope he doesn't take it to heart.
[9664.97s -> 9670.73s]  No, no. I'm just fucking around. We're just, we're just messing around. That's what we do here.
[9674.98s -> 9690.49s]  He's sad. What? Now we're not messing around. That's how you get me. That's interesting.
[9692.60s -> 9711.66s]  Another wedding ring. I don't want this. It's not worth taking. 50 bucks versus 225.
[9712.62s -> 9720.89s]  There's nothing here I want to get rid of. Somebody remember that's here.
[9722.66s -> 9745.48s]  Hello. Somebody in this, this bunker thing over here? What about like under? Is somebody like in
[9745.48s -> 9764.33s]  a basement or something? I don't see any way to get under. Can I go around? No. Somebody's under
[9764.33s -> 9791.00s]  here. Check the tub. After this I have to go home. But somebody's clearly clawing at something.
[9796.18s -> 9811.18s]  Like right here? What is over here? Is it just Creaky House and the Creaky House makes Creaky
[9811.18s -> 9820.10s]  House noises? I mean this, look at this, but there's something in here. All right, I'm going
[9820.10s -> 9838.46s]  back. I don't know. If I miss it, I miss it. I do have enough scrap. All right, we're just going
[9838.46s -> 9850.94s]  to go to the left. We'll go there tomorrow. It's time to eat pills to run. Watch out for the
[9850.94s -> 9868.36s]  mushrooms. Straight across. Mushrooms, mushrooms, mushrooms, mushrooms, no mushrooms. We're good.
[9869.16s -> 9882.17s]  A few hours to get settled. That's the logs if I need them. There's a lot of logs right outside
[9882.17s -> 9907.54s]  of my house here. So let's go down from the house. Fortify. Let's go cook quick. Shit,
[9907.54s -> 9928.04s]  I barricaded that. You idiot. Don't, there's no traps in here, right? Okay. One, two, bang, bang,
[9928.04s -> 9939.16s]  bang, bang, bang. Almost there. So close. This needs to be changed. This is still secure.
[9939.96s -> 9944.49s]  There's a trap still up here. I got to go to the workshop quickly before it gets too late.
[9946.87s -> 9953.45s]  And I'm going to do, first of all, we're going to upgrade the axe to be sturdy blade,
[9953.45s -> 9957.29s]  greatly increased weapon durability. That's the axe head and a bunch of scrap.
[9957.29s -> 9969.98s]  Make it beautiful. I can also do attacks use less stamina. I'm going to do that too. I do
[9969.98s -> 9981.19s]  need to prepare it. I'm going to do that first. Okay. Upgrade light materials, use less stamina
[9981.19s -> 9991.46s]  for attacks. Do that too. This thing is now a powerhouse. What? Oh, so I'm going to get a full
[9991.46s -> 10004.50s]  Todd Howard. Damn. But can you do a full Todd Howard with juke one, juke two or juke three,
[10004.50s -> 10011.16s]  juke four? That's going to be tricky. All right. Back here. Let's do, I need to make bear trap.
[10015.64s -> 10027.78s]  Hot bar upgrade. Good. Light armor. I need two rags. I don't think I have any access to rags
[10027.78s -> 10041.40s]  right now, but get this tape in here. I still have a magazine. I got nails. Okay. I'll figure
[10041.40s -> 10048.02s]  this out tomorrow and we'll go back out. We do need a full inventory rearrangement. Take this
[10048.02s -> 10057.99s]  for a heal. I'll take them both. Alcohol, magazine, toolbox, pills. I don't really need them.
[10058.63s -> 10071.53s]  Flashlight axe gun, board, shell. I'll take, I'll keep one meat in here. So I have, how many do I
[10071.53s -> 10086.06s]  got? Looks good. I'm ready. Let's prepare. I need to board up a window. So let's take that and let's
[10086.06s -> 10102.30s]  take like 20, 30 nails. Right. Okay. I have to do some more boarding. I have the traps with me.
[10103.18s -> 10110.10s]  Turn on the generator before it gets too late, which is all the way out here.
[10110.82s -> 10130.66s]  Yeah. I'll do the traps last. Boink. Okay. There's a trap still up here. This is boarded. It's got
[10130.66s -> 10143.29s]  full health. I just have to worry about the door. In fact, you know what? Like I should really just
[10143.29s -> 10150.70s]  do this to all the fucking doors and windows, shouldn't I? But it's too late. This is good.
[10151.42s -> 10171.00s]  All right. Get this shit over here. Oh, come on. I don't have time for this shit. Like get out.
[10171.00s -> 10178.38s]  Let's go. Whatever. It's, that's fine. And then this, this is actually all right too. I don't
[10178.38s -> 10194.09s]  mind this. I don't mind this at all. All right. Trap going down. This shit's going down right there.
[10194.90s -> 10215.66s]  No. Yeah. Like right there. I trapped myself. Not yet. Because I'm going to do this. Something gets
[10215.66s -> 10237.34s]  stuck there. I'm just going to move this and smash it. Don't move. By the way, I got the rare one.
[10238.06s -> 10251.93s]  Do you guys know these are rare? Did you know these are rare? I got a legendary cup. That's right.
[10251.93s -> 10265.16s]  Fucking raise a death at her. This glued on piece of shit. I need a new mouse.
[10265.72s -> 10284.28s]  Do you have to ask if somebody knows if something's rare? Get an Amazon basic mouse.
[10284.28s -> 10293.77s]  You better believe it. Okay. Here we go. In fact, I'm not going to mess around at all.
[10294.65s -> 10299.69s]  Let's just go ahead and do this now because I know you're going to get in here.
[10313.46s -> 10356.63s]  Here it comes. Here it comes. Here it comes. Okay. Here it comes. No, that door still exists.
[10376.71s -> 10410.06s]  Why did the dog not get in the trap when it came in the door?
[10422.42s -> 10429.70s]  Why did it not trigger the trap? He just got in and just just appeared over here.
[10430.34s -> 10469.99s]  Does dying at the house even matter? Yes, because you don't get the money. Unfortunately,
[10469.99s -> 10483.38s]  you don't get the money. I would have had it too. It's just I, my thought process there was he was
[10483.38s -> 10489.14s]  just breaking through the he broke through the barricade. That's fine. But when he was breaking
[10489.14s -> 10494.26s]  through the door, I just figured I don't want to replace that door. So why not just open the door
[10494.26s -> 10500.76s]  and let him walk in the trap. I opened the door, it got stuck on the fucking bureau. And then he
[10500.76s -> 10506.12s]  teleported to the other side of the screen. And then I got in the trap. I got wily coyote,
[10507.91s -> 10522.39s]  like the roadrunner type shit. This happened. And then the game like just made him go here.
[10522.39s -> 10540.04s]  Whatever. I got a goal. And I'm like, I have all my stuff on me. So I can just go. He jumped
[10540.04s -> 10544.36s]  through the door. Well, I opened the door because I was trying to save time and not have to redo a
[10544.36s -> 10557.88s]  doorway. All right, don't matter. No, not sell this stuff. I want to I will actually I'm going
[10557.88s -> 10564.73s]  to level up here. All right. All the necessary things that I want from you. Didn't even get a
[10564.73s -> 10570.60s]  chance to use my axe. I didn't get to swing it once. I'm going to buy another medium caliber
[10570.60s -> 10579.27s]  bullet, a couple of rags. And that should be all right. No, I'm not going to buy the red egg.
[10580.23s -> 10593.64s]  Oh, I do want a magazine though. Very nice. Spin. Now that was only that was only that was the deal
[10593.64s -> 10611.98s]  for when I got that's not every trap. 4200. Here we go. Do I get to pick another one? Okay,
[10611.98s -> 10619.51s]  I can pick appetite. I would be able to restore my health by eating wood. I mean, that's that's
[10619.51s -> 10628.10s]  good. I'm going to do that. Like, that's just good. The trap. Once a day, you won't trigger a trap.
[10628.10s -> 10634.57s]  I know this is so much for me. It's so much more useful. But still, eating the wood thing is just
[10634.57s -> 10642.89s]  health forever. No, eat the wood. It's health forever. I can eat. I never have to worry about
[10642.89s -> 10669.48s]  health stuff. Where are we? Every time you... Okay, this is me, I think. Turn off the light.
[10671.80s -> 10688.70s]  Well, I don't know. I want to sleep. All right, fine. I don't want to go out yet. I need to wake
[10688.70s -> 10698.23s]  up first. I don't want to wake. This is breakfast breakfast and egg stream. It's too early to cook.
[10698.95s -> 10702.23s]  I don't want to go outside. It's too early to cook. I need to wake up first. All right,
[10702.23s -> 10709.40s]  we'll go take a shower. Sweater and clothes. All right, put on the sweater. Put on the clothes.
[10712.95s -> 10723.05s]  I'll run myself a bath. Franny of washing machine. I spent two days in the queue to get it.
[10723.77s -> 10758.87s]  I'll run myself a bath. Oh. Don't wake up and step in the trap. Oh, that would have been so
[10758.87s -> 10770.54s]  horrible. That would not have even been my fault. And you all know it. All right, it's back to
[10770.54s -> 10789.02s]  storage. And then I'm going for the train. Make another bear trap for later. Okay. Light armor.
[10789.02s -> 10800.98s]  Let's do it. Bingo. Batteries. Magazines. Traps. Put them away. Put the wood away. Put the nails
[10800.98s -> 10807.37s]  away. Keep the pills. Pills can sit out here. That's fine. Put the scrap away and put the
[10807.37s -> 10813.29s]  bullet away as well. I got two hunting rifle. I'm going to hold on to it for an emergency scenario.
[10813.29s -> 10831.13s]  I'm ready. Let's go. I'm out the door. Need to go to the train wreck. Wood for health.
[10832.52s -> 10841.56s]  That's true. The generator is just blaring. Turn generator off the generator. What about the
[10841.56s -> 10853.75s]  generator? I know. And is it any wood or it could be wood planks? Like, can I just take like three
[10853.75s -> 10863.78s]  or four wooden planks with me? Does that like work? Try a different room this next night.
[10864.94s -> 10867.50s]  Yeah, I might. I might come back out to the hallway strat.
[10871.24s -> 10881.35s]  Um, all right. Can I eat? Just, just, can I just bear wood? I can. All right. I'm just gonna bring
[10881.35s -> 10899.50s]  five. All right. That's fine. Cool. And we're out. Bare ass. Over here. Let's check it out.
[10900.06s -> 10918.10s]  If we come across any other bullshit, I have an upgraded axe. The thing is meaty. I can swing it
[10918.10s -> 10923.38s]  a bunch of times. Don't have to worry about it breaking. We're at the hunter's house. We've
[10923.38s -> 10933.43s]  already went in here. Uh, I'm going to take some pills because I want to be able to run
[10933.43s -> 10949.24s]  for a little while. Straight over here. Location found? Question mark. Is that a camp? I don't
[10949.24s -> 10974.26s]  understand. Why is this a question mark? I like, but to be fair, like this, it's it's the same
[10974.26s -> 10980.26s]  color as the ground. It's, it's easy to miss because look at all these rocks. These are,
[10980.26s -> 10984.02s]  it's the same thing, but they're not rocks. They're whatever. You get it.
[10985.38s -> 11036.28s]  I'm not the only one. It's a train. What's up? What's up? Give me those shrooms.
[11043.32s -> 11084.86s]  Train. What's up with the train? All right. Just checking the perimeter. There is something.
[11092.70s -> 11109.91s]  Get all the stuff. Okay. Cool. Got everything. Now what the hell is, what do I do with this train?
[11121.35s -> 11138.95s]  Can I go in here? So why is this such a big point of interest?
[11139.67s -> 11159.69s]  I thought it was like, go to the train. There's a train. What do you mean use my mouse?
[11170.98s -> 11189.38s]  Like that's a door, but I, how do I get to, how do I open it? That's a, that's a door. This looks
[11189.38s -> 11200.47s]  like it. This is, this is the door. Okay. Um, right. What was the code? Note with the code.
[11201.43s -> 11204.63s]  Found some code in the dark times. I don't know what it's for, but I hope it opens that door.
[11205.51s -> 11239.18s]  So what the hell? 8909. What, what are you doing here? Photo. Okay. And alcohol. Don't
[11239.18s -> 11251.02s]  come near me. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. The doctor is lying against the train car's wall.
[11251.02s -> 11260.41s]  His face is covered in sweat. An intense odor of alcohol hangs in the air. Don't come any closer.
[11260.41s -> 11265.13s]  You rotten dog. I won't give you the key. Can't you understand? I saved your life.
[11266.07s -> 11270.87s]  You run away. That's clearing. If it wasn't for me, you owe me for fuck's sake.
[11270.87s -> 11275.40s]  The doctor moves closer to the wall, grotesquely kicking his legs against the floor.
[11276.81s -> 11281.05s]  You think I don't know who you are? Rack. I've managed to get a good look at you.
[11282.14s -> 11287.18s]  Your kind visits us whenever you please. You hide behind the trees, you watch us from a distance,
[11287.18s -> 11293.26s]  and then you disappear. You have no idea how it is to live here. This place, these words, everything
[11293.26s -> 11298.50s]  is fucked up here. I won't take it anymore, do you understand? I won't bear a look at those
[11298.50s -> 11305.16s]  deformed, reeking bodies anymore. I know the cries of those wretched villagers. First they begged for
[11305.16s -> 11310.10s]  help, now I need to hide from them? I've just snored every doctor. How the fuck was I supposed
[11310.10s -> 11317.38s]  to help them? His face goes silent. Now hugging the wall of the train car, he looks truly pathetic.
[11317.38s -> 11327.05s]  Can you hear it? It's the walls. They speak to me. My little girl is calling me. I know she's
[11327.05s -> 11339.30s]  waiting for me. I must come back to her. She's so close. I want to go back home. Please. This key
[11339.30s -> 11374.58s]  is my only chance. Help me escape this place. Help me or kill me. To the underground entrance.
[11374.58s -> 11389.26s]  That's the guy from the start of the game. This is that bastard. Kill him. This is not a decision
[11389.26s -> 11444.28s]  I can make. We'll save him. Choose wisely. Let's go. What are we doing to this guy? Pretty unanimous
[11444.28s -> 11451.86s]  to save him. Kill then save him. Kill him and then be like, all right, I guess I'll, I guess I'll
[11451.86s -> 11456.89s]  let you know where it is. Yeah, kill him and then show him on the map where to get out. You know,
[11456.89s -> 11461.29s]  like stick the axe in his chest and then show him the map and go, this is how you get out.
[11463.85s -> 11475.00s]  No! And it's his last thing he sees. All right, we're saving him. Thanks for voting. Show the
[11475.00s -> 11478.92s]  underground entrance on the map. I take out the map and show the doctor the location of the abandoned
[11478.92s -> 11483.96s]  house with the hidden underground entrance. The doctor stares at the map for a long while without
[11483.96s -> 11489.40s]  lifting his gaze to meet me. Thank you. He removes his dirty glasses with a trembling hand and freezes.
[11489.96s -> 11494.73s]  I will wait for you there and better take the essential things with you.
[11495.37s -> 11518.04s]  Looks like returning here will be impossible. Found the doctor. Where are we going? Found the
[11518.04s -> 11522.60s]  doctor. I've agreed to help him escape the woods. We are to meet by the door inside the underground
[11522.60s -> 11543.62s]  passage. The village? Oh, there, underground entrance. Oh, right, that, with the key and the
[11543.62s -> 11550.66s]  21 at the beginning of the game. Right, okay. How did I get there before? So I gotta go all the
[11550.66s -> 11562.07s]  way back here. Oh, that's not, that sucks. Okay. Well, doctor, I'll see you at the ex. It's getting
[11562.07s -> 11578.90s]  late, so it's time to get the heck out of here. It's noon. I could go through here. I'll go through
[11578.90s -> 11585.96s]  here and send my stuff here. That's an easier place to hold. Let me see if I can do that.
[11590.65s -> 11600.44s]  Noon is late for boomers. I need to take drugs, like, seriously. Give it a rest. Come on, man.
[11600.44s -> 11640.58s]  Let's go. Can I go down? Leave me alone. A natural wall. Burned house. What? Oh, fuck.
[11641.38s -> 11669.16s]  Where is this thing? Why does it have to be these, like, giant logs everywhere? Down all the way
[11669.16s -> 11679.21s]  around. I've walked by it. What? I, I know, it's right here, but I can't, how do I get around this
[11679.21s -> 11692.63s]  shit? Down here? Yeah, all right, there's, there's one spot, there's one parking space worth of space
[11692.63s -> 11740.38s]  for me to go through the unnatural wall. I don't like this vision shit. Key to the burned house.
[11741.34s -> 11823.37s]  I need a key. I just got it. There's shit over there. Okay. It didn't do anything. Oh, there's
[11823.37s -> 11838.76s]  no chests here. It was a lie. Just checking around the whole house. Relax. I'm just checking around
[11838.76s -> 11859.53s]  the whole house. Relax. Relax, Jeremy. I'm sorry. Don't relax. No, I'm just saying that out loud.
[11874.54s -> 11892.02s]  Made it. Look at that. Shortcut to this old house. All right. Dry meadow. Here we are.
[11900.20s -> 11907.82s]  Oh, hell yeah. I remember this place. This is my first house. Does my stove still work?
[11907.82s -> 11927.70s]  Oh, you better believe it does. Light the oven. Ten essence. What is this bullshit? All right.
[11927.70s -> 11959.18s]  We're good. Um, I have to survive in here. Does this place have gas? What about a container? Do
[11959.18s -> 11973.08s]  I have anything for the container? All right, this has got plenty of gas. I don't even need
[11973.08s -> 11980.12s]  to fill it. All right, but I do need to, I do need to fill the thing to make some boards and try to
[11980.12s -> 11987.66s]  board up a couple of windows here. I have to live here. Are you guys cheating? Wait, is everybody
[11987.66s -> 12002.97s]  cheating right now? Why do I know that? Should I know that? Or are you just cheating? It was
[12002.97s -> 12025.96s]  under the thing. This is cheating. You guys just cheated. Exploding barrels? This is, I, this is
[12025.96s -> 12035.26s]  cheating. I have an exploding barrel. All right, wait a minute. We saw that code already. All right,
[12035.26s -> 12064.25s]  I believe you. I believe you this once. Exploding barrel. Okay, I'm gonna have to check that. I'm
[12064.25s -> 12075.05s]  gonna have to set that up tonight. That's cool. All right, let's store some of this shit. I need
[12075.05s -> 12082.14s]  to keep the wood out. I still have plenty of, put the fabric away. Keep the, let's do a bear trap
[12085.83s -> 12090.39s]  and then single shot pistol. Who cares? Fire it once and just throw it away.
[12091.11s -> 12096.01s]  Knife is going to be for an emergency scenario. Or actually, I don't need the, that's okay.
[12096.98s -> 12102.47s]  I have heel, exploding barrel. Let's put the exploding barrel up. Nails, I need that to
[12102.47s -> 12109.53s]  board up some stuff. Let's do that right now. This is boarded. This is boarded. This is going
[12109.53s -> 12122.22s]  to be boarded as well. This is a great place to do this. I need, I need that light. Turn the
[12122.22s -> 12146.49s]  generator on. Turn on the gas. Yeah, so that will come in handy here. There's only one.
[12147.13s -> 12165.78s]  Fuck did I say? It's like smashed my face against the door. There's only one lamp in here. All right,
[12165.78s -> 12179.88s]  this is not going to happen. Like why, why can I not have a level up scenario where we're staying
[12179.88s -> 12205.10s]  here? This is perfect. This is amazing. Holy shit. This is the best room in the whole game.
[12208.07s -> 12216.31s]  Oh, barrel. Um, let's put the exploding barrel. Um, no, not yet. This is a cool item. I'm going
[12216.31s -> 12238.49s]  to save it. Let's go. Don't let that lightly go. It's, uh, I know you're right. It's like too late
[12238.49s -> 12242.17s]  to move this shit. I wish I could like activate a thing that made it so I could move stuff
[12243.50s -> 12249.86s]  not like a toddler. You put me on the back of this thing to move it. And if I need to move it,
[12249.86s -> 12254.10s]  if you know, I don't care about scratching the floor. I'm going to sprint and fucking be able
[12254.10s -> 12266.73s]  to move this thing 100 miles per hour. The only reason why people move furniture like that is
[12266.73s -> 12313.21s]  because they're concerned about scratching their floors. All right, hang on. Here we go. This is
[12313.21s -> 12332.86s]  where we lose. Is he going to cry? You drinking lemon juice is my secret slime. Don't forget your
[12332.86s -> 12346.87s]  rifle at the other base. Oh, I won't. I plan on actually on going back up there. In fact,
[12346.87s -> 12354.62s]  no, just use the axe. Take the bell. Oh yeah, there's a bunch of stuff. I need to,
[12355.66s -> 12361.45s]  there's a bunch of shit up there. I don't have the bell down here. I can't ring it.
[12362.25s -> 12389.06s]  There's a light of flare. Okay. I mean, it's just sitting there.
[12391.91s -> 12401.91s]  Best emote coming through the room. I've done a pretty good job of sitting still
[12411.83s -> 12434.20s]  and I'm going to scrap all these traps. Somebody running around outside over here. Can you hear it?
[12439.26s -> 12446.89s]  Wait, this is the part. Doesn't one of these like spawn something.
[12447.45s -> 12457.45s]  I got plenty of room to move around here though. So I should be fine.
[12465.88s -> 12470.50s]  And I got the axe. Best melee weapon in the game. So don't worry. I'll be good.
[12471.30s -> 12483.14s]  The bell's not going to work in chapter two. Well, whatever.
[12511.08s -> 12526.04s]  God, this is so much better than the other place. Angel, angel thumb. Not yet. Not yet. Two more
[12526.04s -> 12581.45s]  hours. Shit can go horribly wrong at seven 30. There you are. There you are. All right.
[12581.45s -> 12603.90s]  Let's break them down. All right. Move. Dismantle.
[12620.50s -> 12623.46s]  Revealing his chest covered in horrid growths.
[12624.18s -> 12631.08s]  It is fused with a porous helmet pulsating to the rhythm of his breath. I'm starting to feel dizzy.
[12631.08s -> 12635.02s]  Although loosening his grip, the man raises his left arm, bringing his forearm to my face
[12636.44s -> 12646.98s]  and forces a dab out of me. It's pale as paper and reads. Okay. Do not open the door. Let's stick
[12646.98s -> 12674.23s]  together. Do not open the door. Medium caliber. I don't have any junk for you.
[12675.35s -> 12690.76s]  I have here that I don't care about. I eat this wood though.
[12692.90s -> 12700.15s]  Just hold on. I will store some of this stuff. Don't leave the trader. Well, eventually I have
[12700.15s -> 12713.11s]  to. I can't just. I'm going to save this scrap. I might need it eventually. I'll sell the fabric.
[12713.75s -> 12729.94s]  Let's store the bear. I don't know. Single shot pistol. I don't need. What the hell am I going
[12729.94s -> 12744.70s]  to do with that right now? Nails. Boards. Just give me a second. Mushroom. Scrap. Magazine.
[12744.70s -> 12751.74s]  Medium caliber bullet. Okay. That's what I want. And then you can take. Just take this meat. I'm
[12751.74s -> 12768.46s]  not going to use it. Yes, I will. Can I upgrade my hot bar again? Or is it over?
[12768.46s -> 12778.65s]  I can't craft any more. I can't craft any more of this. So it's going into the trash. I'm just
[12778.65s -> 12808.90s]  going to sell it. Weird Jupiter. All right. I have to go back to the other hideout and get
[12808.90s -> 12823.59s]  myself ready for the final boss. Hook this. Keep the scrap. Take the rags too. And the nails.
[12824.55s -> 12831.18s]  Yeah. And the gas. Replace the gas with this three wood. Who gives a shit. All right.
[12832.30s -> 12840.57s]  Here we go. Cook that thing. It's funny. Essence. Boy, what a waste of money.
[12842.14s -> 12850.49s]  All right. This is the part. I'm going to go back up to the old spot. Which is here. Get everything
[12850.49s -> 12858.68s]  I want. Meet the guy down here. Sounds like a plan. And I have to. I'm probably going to have
[12858.68s -> 12862.92s]  to last one more night in the. I'm going to try to. No, I'm going to try to go up, get everything
[12862.92s -> 12870.97s]  I want, come down, last a night, go over here. That's the plan. I'm out. Let's go. Make it quick.
[12876.42s -> 12933.67s]  Straight up. I'm coming back down here. So I want this to be full of gas. Let's go. At least one
[12933.67s -> 12950.89s]  more night over there. Any, any drugs? If I have them, take them. Food, drugs. No, let's go. Hurry
[12950.89s -> 12975.85s]  up. Food and drugs. That's all you need. In this game. Not actually. I need to go up through this
[12975.85s -> 12982.97s]  little, this little hut, right? Sit over here. There. Where the car is. All right. Making good time.
[12983.85s -> 12999.66s]  The house. And then it's just up into the left. Oh my God. Jeremy.
[12999.74s -> 13030.76s]  Hey. No woods. Okay. Almost there. Hasn't even been two hours. We're good.
[13047.88s -> 13070.89s]  What the fuck did I just double take it? I'm here. Let's go. All right. Who's walking?
[13070.89s -> 13111.13s]  Who's walking? Stop walking. Okay. Good. Let's do it. The traps in here. How did the dog get in this
[13111.13s -> 13139.75s]  is what I want to know. How did the dog get in here? All right. Let's go. I need my important
[13139.75s -> 13159.77s]  shit. Ah, there's so many things that could be important in here. Rifle. Rifle ammo. Magazine.
[13159.77s -> 13188.31s]  Healing shit. Um, should I make my armor put it on? Why does the game do that to me? All right. The
[13188.31s -> 13197.54s]  bell. Does the bell work? I don't think, does the bell actually work? All right. I get a gun.
[13198.60s -> 13213.96s]  Batteries. Big flashlight. Heals. More heals. Take out the important shit. Bring the, do I have
[13213.96s -> 13230.26s]  alcohol out here? Put the trap away. I'm going to, no, this is not important. Two clips. Five
[13230.26s -> 13235.78s]  batteries. The watch. I can only, I'm only taking things if they're in like at least a stack of
[13235.78s -> 13242.02s]  three. You fucking stupid ass thing. Like I'm in the menu. What the hell do you think I'm trying
[13242.02s -> 13253.58s]  to put it? Now where the fuck did it go? Okay. Three, three. Get the rope out of here. Scrap is
[13253.58s -> 13266.57s]  probably going to be important. Take the scrap. Only a stack of two though. Put the weapons up
[13266.57s -> 13280.42s]  here. What time is it? Okay. Good time. We're hunting rifle. Block picks. Bell. Battery flashlight.
[13282.14s -> 13296.97s]  Alcohol. No. Watch. Scrap. Nails. Maybe some wood. Wood. Yeah. And how many nails do I have?
[13296.97s -> 13308.94s]  Take 50 nails. 20 wood. Don't take the bell. All right. Bell is staying. Maybe more wood just so I
[13308.94s -> 13320.97s]  can make sure I can get, what about maybe gas? Some gas. Gasoline. This looks all right. Scrap.
[13320.97s -> 13335.30s]  Gas. Shovel. Rifle ammo. Rifle ammo is up here. No knife. Give her the knife. Exploding
[13335.30s -> 13345.69s]  barrel is a funny laugh out loud moment, but of course it has to stay. Gun. Light. Melee.
[13346.33s -> 13375.82s]  Ranged. Healing. Gun. Okay. Rifle ammo. Magazine. That? Okay. Shovel. I think that's good. I think
[13375.82s -> 13389.24s]  we're good. Full tank of gas. Armor. Heals. Heals. Heals. Batteries. Flashlight. Gun. Magazines for
[13389.24s -> 13403.96s]  gun. Hunting rifle. Medium caliber bullet. Nothing else is standing out to me here.
[13403.96s -> 13425.11s]  Do I actually need this shovel? This is already upgraded. I have to leave. Repair it. That takes
[13425.11s -> 13438.54s]  too much scrap. I'm gonna need that scrap for something else. I'm out. I'm out. Ditch the
[13438.54s -> 13465.18s]  barrel. No I can't. I have to take it. Let's go. Back down. All right. I'm ready to take on whatever
[13465.18s -> 13473.58s]  is gonna be taken on at this like end game stage here. I'm not stepping in any more fucking poison.
[13481.93s -> 13524.76s]  Beautiful. I'll take the extra scrap. Why not? Oh you dick. Hurry up. Why do you exist?
[13535.67s -> 13543.18s]  Why can't I just walk down? Why can't I walk down? Why do you have to have this gigantic
[13543.82s -> 13608.04s]  wall of thing? Oh my god. It's a sneeze. That was a sneeze. I have to go through the house.
[13614.17s -> 13634.38s]  Fuck you. Fuck you. Seriously. You can't have like two. What's this music playing for?
[13634.94s -> 13673.32s]  Was that a sound clip from the movies? He's like a half-life scientist getting hurt.
[13677.80s -> 13695.14s]  Jesus christ. Okay. Fuck. All right. Let's live another day in here.
[13704.22s -> 13708.54s]  What do I got? I want to. After this day is over I'm gonna repair everything.
[13709.58s -> 13713.90s]  We're just gonna exist in here and I'm just gonna kill everything that comes in.
[13714.70s -> 13721.40s]  I'm gonna just attack it. It's going to be killed. There's enough gas to last one more night.
[13722.95s -> 13734.74s]  Anybody that comes in here is going to be killed. And this is right there but it's not it's night
[13734.74s -> 13749.51s]  time. I could just go right here and meet the doctor but it's 17 o'clock. Should I just do this?
[13749.51s -> 13754.55s]  Do I have time to get over there? I need to repair my shit. Wait wait wait wait. No. Do I?
[13754.55s -> 13770.10s]  No. Let's go. Hold on. Let me repair my shit. Okay. I'm going. All right doctor. The doctor's
[13770.10s -> 13775.67s]  gonna explode. He's gonna turn into a giant monster. Do I have time? Let's go. I better find it.
[13779.14s -> 13781.94s]  Already. Did I use the runner already? I did. I don't have any drugs.
[13792.89s -> 13807.91s]  Oh I hope I. Yeah. Here it is. Made it. All right. Where's the doctor? I should take everything I
[13807.91s -> 13820.07s]  need with me. Coming back may prove impossible. Way ahead of you. Way ahead of you. Do I have
[13820.07s -> 13848.47s]  everything I need? Yes. Do I? Oh shit. I have to do this. Backpack. How would the doctor do
[13848.47s -> 13882.89s]  this by himself? There's no way he would. What's up? Are we going? Locked. It's my only way out.
[13882.89s -> 13886.89s]  I won't be able to open it without my key. Ask the doctor to use the key. Look at the handle.
[13887.93s -> 13897.86s]  Hey you open this in case something's back here. That's bad. That's funny. Hey you do it. Look
[13897.86s -> 13945.93s]  through the keyhole. Is somebody standing there? All right doctor. You go first. I think someone's
[13945.93s -> 13963.48s]  still moving there under the rubble. Man. I stumbled upon something amongst the rubble.
[13964.60s -> 13971.77s]  Strange soft item. The tunnel has collapsed recently. The reinforced steel protruding from
[13971.77s -> 13976.97s]  the debris has not been covered with rust yet. When I gaze into the tunnel I notice a silhouette
[13976.97s -> 13982.17s]  of a man on the ground. Suddenly the man snaps to life as if woken from a deep slumber.
[13983.42s -> 13989.77s]  Who goes there? I hear a faint, unnaturally distorted male voice. Are you one of them?
[13990.49s -> 13996.49s]  The man attempts to get up but fails. I can see him desperately flailing his limbs around. It's
[13997.05s -> 14003.43s]  as if his back has been glued to the ground. No please. As I approach him he shuffles his legs
[14003.43s -> 14008.39s]  nervously as if trying to retreat into the collapsed tunnel. I didn't do anything. I beg
[14008.39s -> 14014.46s]  you. I just wanted to pass to get back to my family. The tree is blocked. The only way out.
[14014.46s -> 14019.69s]  The only path home. A huge talking tree. I begged it to let me pass but it wouldn't listen.
[14020.49s -> 14026.70s]  I could not understand what it was saying to me so it came here. The man props himself up on his
[14026.70s -> 14031.91s]  elbows with a huge effort. He tries to straighten his body but something is firmly holding him by
[14031.91s -> 14039.11s]  the back and the neck. I can't. I can't do it. I can't get up. The man drops into the rubble
[14039.11s -> 14045.59s]  then goes silent. He clenches his fist. My head hurts. The man places his hand on his forehead
[14045.59s -> 14054.28s]  and feels a strange dent above his left brow. He breezes. What? What is this? He carefully inserts
[14054.28s -> 14062.63s]  his index finger into the hole. His eyelid twitches. My stone. I hear a sound as if an
[14062.63s -> 14068.39s]  eggshell cracking. The forehead bends under his hand. The stranger pushes another finger into the
[14068.39s -> 14078.71s]  hole. A thick goose pews from the wound. I can hear his skull cracking. My little stone. The man
[14078.71s -> 14083.75s]  slowly removes his fingers from the hole in his head. A colorless ooze dripping from them.
[14084.39s -> 14092.15s]  He's holding something. A round object. That's why. He swings his left hand and throws the object
[14092.15s -> 14100.12s]  at me. A small irregular ball bounces off my arm and lands at my feet. Looks like a bullet but it's
[14100.12s -> 14115.00s]  soft. Okay. This this is what put me to sleep. His head lifelessly drops to the concrete floor
[14115.00s -> 14124.89s]  of the destroyed tunnel and goes still. Suddenly I can hear the bang of the metal door followed by
[14124.89s -> 14144.65s]  the sound of fading footsteps. It's the doctor. What do you mean it's the doctor? A big sign on the door
[14144.65s -> 14170.66s]  reads closed ahead. Where's the doctor? Where'd you go? Oh yuck. I just wanted to pass. Return to my
[14170.66s -> 14204.47s]  family. I think I got this military flashlight. Oh shit that's a lizard. Where is it? Where is it?
[14204.47s -> 14239.48s]  Where is it? Roats? Some strange organic growths. What the hell are you? Eyes? Soft organism growing
[14239.48s -> 14273.94s]  out of the ground. Oh shiny. A shiny stone tied to a wooden cross. You're playing a challenging and
[14273.94s -> 14277.22s]  unforgiving game. You will not be led by the hand. Respect the woods. Be patient and focus.
[14286.62s -> 14310.09s]  Still on first island. Tutorial complete. Where'd the doctor go? Chapter two. How long is chapter
[14310.09s -> 14336.34s]  two? The swamp. It's twice as long. It's 10 hours? Oh shit. Broken compressor. A damaged compressor
[14336.34s -> 14343.82s]  used to refill oxygen tanks. I should be able to fix it. I don't have that thing. Oh fuck there's
[14343.82s -> 14349.90s]  like a whole area. All right let's go. There's only two chapters right?
[14356.60s -> 14363.40s]  Rusty oxygen tanks. Rusty oxygen tanks. They're useless. Generator. Well here's the house. Good
[14363.40s -> 14392.81s]  thing I brought the gas. Dumped the whole thing. That's why I brought it. All right is there a
[14392.81s -> 14406.39s]  stove in here? Gas tank. Hitting the tank will release the gas under high pressure. Note day one
[14406.39s -> 14412.95s]  the compressor is broken. So is the lock on the trap door leading to the underground? Had to use
[14412.95s -> 14421.11s]  a blow torch. Fucking moisture. We took photos of the tree from observation point in the vicinity of
[14421.11s -> 14431.78s]  3C. It grew twice its size in a month. Really quick even for a local standard. Okay. 1520 hours. I'm
[14431.78s -> 14436.26s]  slowly running out of oxygen. I've sent two men to search for nearby junkyard. Maybe we won't have
[14436.26s -> 14442.39s]  to go back for spare parts for the compressor. Watch out for the cottage near the junkyard
[14442.39s -> 14451.08s]  marked building on the map. Someone could be living there. At least 10 locals lurking between
[14451.08s -> 14455.56s]  the trees. How do they know about us? We won't be able to gather our equipment in time. The risk of
[14455.56s -> 14480.41s]  getting detected is too high. You need to evac. What the hell? There's a stove. Radio. It's covered
[14480.41s -> 14483.85s]  in a thick layer of dust. Looks like no one's used it for a long time but it still smells of warm
[14483.85s -> 14494.33s]  plastic and burnt wires. Okay. I gotta get this place ready. Where's the workbench? New house.
[14498.14s -> 14518.39s]  Stop doing that. Can I throw like a grenade down here? All right. This is a bigger house. What's
[14518.39s -> 14524.95s]  up here? Hey, what's that? A crate covered in a strange organic black shell. I won't be able
[14524.95s -> 14531.54s]  to open it until I get rid of the substance. I can only decipher individual words. Shell,
[14531.54s -> 14570.73s]  thick glue, light. Fuck out of here. Where's the workbench? This place is enormous.
[14572.42s -> 14583.45s]  This looks like a good spot to hide. Yeah, this is definitely the spot. Here it is. I need a key.
[14584.92s -> 14599.08s]  No. What? Where's the workbench? Is there no workbench? It's right there. All right. Hold on.
[14599.08s -> 14611.00s]  This is where I need to store some shit. Battery. Put the shovel away. Actually,
[14611.00s -> 14613.72s]  I'm gonna need all this because I'm gonna board up the doors and everything. All right. Scrap
[14613.72s -> 14620.34s]  can go in here. Nails can go in here. This drug can go in here. All right. I'm gonna actually
[14620.34s -> 14623.38s]  keep the nails because I'm gonna have to start boarding stuff up and figure out what I want to
[14623.38s -> 14640.44s]  do. Wardrobe. Okay. So we've got light. Door. Window. Window. Window. Opening. Opening. I think
[14640.52s -> 14649.77s]  it's potentially here in the workroom. Window. Window. Open the gook. Hold on.
[14656.15s -> 14662.30s]  This might be not a bad place to do it either. Like through here. All right. Let me go to that
[14662.30s -> 14686.54s]  crate. Nothing even in here. All right. I need to prepare the compressor. I have a cottage near
[14686.54s -> 14696.04s]  the junkyard. Village. These are marked on the map now. All right. Where do I want to go? Maybe
[14696.04s -> 14705.83s]  here. This is not terrible. There's a door. There's already a barricaded window. People can get
[14705.83s -> 14716.84s]  through this though, I think. I don't know. Or in here. I would say down there is probably the
[14716.84s -> 14730.15s]  safest. Let's go ahead and start that process. This is not bad either. It's it's in here. This
[14730.15s -> 14742.97s]  is the one. This is the one. Okay. So looks like the only real reason to come through here.
[14743.69s -> 14747.69s]  I'm gonna board this up. This can be there. That's fine. Let me just take a look outside.
[14749.66s -> 14757.43s]  Exploding barrel. Oh my god. I have a bunch of these. Oh I feel like this is gonna get hard or
[14757.43s -> 14762.54s]  something. This is where it gets hard, right? This is where this is where it gets very hard.
[14773.90s -> 14780.58s]  All right. So let me check down here. Let me make sure it doubles. I hate when that fucking thing
[14780.58s -> 14787.62s]  does that. This is not ideal. Actually it's not that bad though. I have to just pick one. I have
[14787.62s -> 14798.50s]  to pick one. The workbench room is good but it's too small. This is too small. Too small. I don't
[14798.50s -> 14812.47s]  like it. Too small. We're going up here. This is the one. This one's a little bit bigger. This one's
[14812.47s -> 14822.38s]  already barricaded. Let's do this one. And there's already a lamp in here too. We can board this but
[14822.38s -> 14834.10s]  not yet. I could even board this. They can only come in from one way. Let's bring this up here.
[14834.10s -> 14846.74s]  I went to the store and came back. Is he still? Is he still dying to bear? Is it time to save bear
[14846.74s -> 14861.19s]  traps? And exploding barrel right here. Let's do it. Exploding barrel right here. I'm gonna wait
[14861.19s -> 14882.54s]  for someone to come in. Boom. Good night. Okay. What's going on? It's raining. All right. Wardrobe.
[14882.54s -> 14888.95s]  We got matches. Rag. Where's the generator? I gotta keep burning that into my mind. Up, right,
[14890.09s -> 14901.90s]  down. We got gas. We can come through here though. Pick up the gas tank. No.
[14902.78s -> 14912.10s]  Make some traps. Let's make a few traps. Yeah this is where I wouldn't like being in here.
[14912.66s -> 14922.79s]  So that's how you get the generator on. This is a long way to go except for right there. But it's
[14922.79s -> 14927.90s]  all right. I'll explode these motherfuckers when they come in the door. Or like you know that's a
[14928.78s -> 14932.54s]  yep that's no it's not that's a dad that's that's a that's a dead end that's a bad strategy
[14943.06s -> 14966.17s]  all right bear traps let's go i gotta i keep getting new places bear traps make two or three
[14966.17s -> 14984.46s]  though looking good pull them out let's go this is the final new place that's true
[14985.34s -> 15005.61s]  got plenty of gas stop with that board it up board it up bear trap here this is a good place
[15005.61s -> 15010.49s]  for it to be couldn't i could not ask for a better place to have it because then i really
[15010.49s -> 15017.05s]  only have to worry about this side over here and some random psycho that just like comes in the room
[15030.44s -> 15037.61s]  that's secure that's secure this is not secure but it's about to be because i want to show you
[15039.50s -> 15067.19s]  oh i do it check this out i'm gonna put a bear trap here and if i hear that get activated oh i
[15067.19s -> 15094.42s]  open the door and blast although i can't leave if i do this so that's the plan that's the plan
[15100.31s -> 15109.50s]  put the gun back here flashlight back here i'm gonna keep that in my inventory heels can stay
[15109.50s -> 15112.70s]  now i'm gonna go store this stuff because everything's been boarded i just need how
[15112.70s -> 15121.35s]  many do you need to board what is it it's uh three and seven so i need three six nine wood
[15122.15s -> 15146.90s]  and then 21 nine and 21 because in case these break so stick that i need nine of these
[15148.02s -> 15157.99s]  it was a really stupid way to do that but whatever all right nine of these put the barrels back
[15158.95s -> 15169.51s]  clips can stay and i need 21 of these okay don't need matches i might hold on to one of these just
[15169.51s -> 15175.21s]  to do it here's the heel and i also have bandages i'm gonna store these
[15176.57s -> 15189.34s]  store the flare battery's fine 921 a panic scenario might be all right all right we're good we're
[15189.34s -> 15204.54s]  good okay i have a plan i have a plan there's one of these down here too actually i'm gonna keep that
[15206.46s -> 15209.82s]  this is bait because when this turns on it's gonna be flashing through the window
[15210.54s -> 15220.38s]  this is gonna attract so many people into this room i think that's not a bad call
[15221.02s -> 15242.78s]  i don't want it all right is it it's almost time thank you for coming through this door
[15243.90s -> 15263.26s]  because um i wouldn't have known it existed here we go i'm gonna turn on the generator
[15263.90s -> 15271.72s]  just wait i don't want to waste that much gas surround yourself with explosive barrels and
[15271.72s -> 15279.74s]  traps and just let the monsters come at you go out in a blaze of glory you don't get debated here
[15279.74s -> 15287.37s]  i won't but what's gonna happen is when i i'm gonna keep this door open when i hear the first like
[15289.05s -> 15294.36s]  i'm gonna just open the door make sure i can how big of an explosion radius is this
[15295.08s -> 15316.79s]  can somebody help me out here is a huge i'm gonna get this in the corner so if i have this here i'm
[15316.79s -> 15320.97s]  gonna make sure i can open the door all right so let's do like a little rehearsal here
[15322.73s -> 15338.23s]  what's that somebody right there boom because the traps are gonna be right here all right time
[15338.23s -> 15354.68s]  turn generator on let's do it i got time i got time i got time i got time i got time to do it i
[15354.68s -> 15366.46s]  got time to do it up there to block the light fuck you i almost it's turned out to be four i found
[15366.46s -> 15374.15s]  new signs 17 kilometers west of the hideout 33 points 12 circles cataloged pattern unattentive
[15374.15s -> 15387.42s]  simple scribblings and a madman three shotgun shells okay get this why is this chair here get
[15387.42s -> 15434.02s]  out of the way got it good okay pull this back here so i can still open trap put it down let's
[15434.02s -> 15450.44s]  go this is gonna move in the corner 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 coming up 20 come up 20 coming up 20
[15450.44s -> 15464.39s]  coming up don't move okay i'm ready remember trap outside we hear it open the door boom
[15464.63s -> 15491.32s]  i'm not moving move the chair what do you mean move the chair i can't i can't move anything guys
[15497.11s -> 15560.54s]  is it the radio e f w r a f ra us to us come back to us come back to us i'm close just chill
[15575.80s -> 15578.36s]  the reason why i would i don't want to move the chair is because it's gonna make noise
[15579.24s -> 15597.54s]  all right hold on i can still see out of my prep what are you doing
[15599.54s -> 15620.33s]  why is this stuff moving why is this stuff moving fuck no my trap my plan you've ruined my plan
[15624.33s -> 15645.75s]  don't move it's bait to get you to scream so they can know where you are it's just a dog
[15647.51s -> 15658.52s]  you're not gonna get in no you won't get in you got that and you have the door to do as well
[15659.24s -> 15667.85s]  by the way if you do get in i'll get you uh cazzie thanks for the five community subs cazzie
[15673.05s -> 15680.49s]  five drop there all right i gotta be ready this dog is not going to go into the trap
[15681.13s -> 15693.91s]  it will if i go like this though oh shit oh what the fuck there's an area in the room
[15693.91s -> 15704.87s]  oh the dog didn't even get trapped
[15706.31s -> 15756.33s]  does the eye see me don't get comfortable yet that was horrible
[15795.08s -> 15799.48s]  here's how that happened well first of all it shouldn't happen but the reason is because
[15800.52s -> 15804.84s]  you can see this object that's movable this object that all the objects in the room
[15804.84s -> 15811.32s]  and that one's not here but the other ones are and it's the only thing that doesn't show up
[15812.04s -> 15826.70s]  and i just whatever that's still a good strategy and i'm gonna do it again well maybe it's not i'm
[15826.70s -> 15835.50s]  just gonna keep you know you know fuck that i'm gonna keep this door open because when an alien
[15835.50s -> 15842.46s]  like that comes in the room i need a way to okay i'm gonna put a trap like here and like run through
[15842.46s -> 15853.30s]  this door and like bait him into the trap i'm not just gonna stand in a cube this is the thing
[15853.30s -> 15856.58s]  that needs to be boarded this is the thing that needs to be protected and if somebody comes in
[15856.58s -> 15885.06s]  you bait him around the trap anyways i where's the trader usually they're right here no trader
[15885.62s -> 15913.00s]  didn't you say i had a reputation with the trader the three it's fucking pinwheel three visitors
[15913.00s -> 15918.28s]  stare at me in silence as i'm waiting for my move i can only hear the heavy breathing of the
[15918.28s -> 15923.64s]  tallest figure holding a giant bag as he opens a bag the room is filled with an intense smell of
[15923.64s -> 15943.66s]  mushrooms apparently they wish to give me something well you're very loud whatever you are let's go
[15943.66s -> 15953.00s]  with um how many nails do i have let's get some more nails some drugs get some more no no get these
[15953.00s -> 15968.62s]  drugs medium bullet medium bullet i want the medium bullet okay all right now get out of here

[16328.33s -> 16332.97s]  were growing back right in front of my eyes i was afraid i would get stuck between trunks
[16334.33s -> 16338.49s]  losing that sow made their blood run cold they escaped fearing starvation
[16339.45s -> 16346.57s]  it pops the cigarette out of the frying pan and into the fire they have a camp in the old quarry
[16346.57s -> 16354.76s]  in the southeastern edge of the swamp thanks i used to come here to treat people i pulled out kids

[16361.80s -> 16369.93s]  doctor in the area he cut us off from the outside world first you then the woods no help from anyone
[16369.93s -> 16374.49s]  last time i came here was three or four years ago and the trees blocked the path
[16376.92s -> 16381.32s]  i'm gonna kill him it just didn't fit okay so he was curious uh the doctor looks around it's
[16381.32s -> 16385.64s]  different now the fields are flooded everyone in the village is dead so much work for nothing

[16447.40s -> 16452.12s]  diver i've seen similar one in the northeastern edge of the swamp too we just got all kinds of
[16452.12s -> 16456.36s]  information to give me an info dump on me i've realized something that came to me when we were
[16456.36s -> 16460.76s]  walking through the tunnels oh you mean when you were running from me from the tunnels and
[16461.24s -> 16464.20s]  two heads are better than one i could have handed you like a rifle
[16466.54s -> 16473.45s]  idiot you're like a disease you and your kind the doctor takes a step back as if he was afraid
[16473.45s -> 16480.79s]  of me at the same time a sinister smile appears on his face you don't belong to this land you
[16480.79s -> 16487.43s]  weren't here when the forest was born you're a splinter a foreign body a vagabond and then
[16487.43s -> 16492.87s]  the forest and everything else here these are the antibodies even the morons from the village
[16493.59s -> 16498.39s]  raging white blood cells and an infected bloodstream that's the reason we hide from us
[16499.93s -> 16503.85s]  doctor is visibly pleased with himself in his theory his hands are no longer trembling
[16503.85s -> 16513.32s]  he produces a hand-rolled cigarette and lights it logical isn't it this sucks
[16515.88s -> 16525.34s]  taking every bone in my body to not just attack but anyways um stuff marked on the
[16525.90s -> 16551.96s]  the peak something must have scared them off from the huge tree shrine
[16553.40s -> 16560.58s]  the figure of the shrine bears the signs of teeth it's partially eaten i mean i eat wood
[16561.30s -> 16572.68s]  nothing wrong with that it's all good a big tree hold on i don't i don't even want that

[16831.29s -> 16843.67s]  who are you who are you wait bloody hell you're alive the old man extends his hand blindly trying
[16843.67s -> 16850.52s]  to reach me enough from around here hey you can't be all them lads are dead it's only me me and
[16851.40s -> 16857.05s]  he finally finds my arm and grabs it for a moment he clutches my hand in silence then i

[16867.62s -> 16873.94s]  his gaze stops somewhere under the leaky barn ceiling what the old man suddenly jumps up what

[16879.46s -> 16885.46s]  it looks like a tree but those faces i know of buggers every single one of them so close

[16891.24s -> 16896.70s]  i don't have to look at him the old man lets go of my hand to lean against the broken back
[16896.70s -> 16904.38s]  of the chair he sighs with relief it disgusts me it fucking disgusts me this buggery this fucking
[16904.38s -> 16911.90s]  scum all the time i have to listen it's pathetic blabber complaining all the time as if i was
[16911.90s -> 16920.97s]  supposed to believe it's human that it's me soca yeah right he suddenly reaches towards me with
[16920.97s -> 16925.45s]  both hands almost falling off from the chair he grabs onto my sleeve i feel all his weight
[16926.49s -> 16935.82s]  you lad you've got your hands and legs strong arms i beg of you get rid of that filth from my
[16935.82s -> 16941.98s]  village i can't bear another day of that abomination whiling and sobbing i want to
[16941.98s -> 16950.02s]  die in peace fucking hell i want to die in peace listen to me i thought about it for a long time
[16950.58s -> 16957.34s]  i've had a lot of time to think for fuck's sake his eyes widen his pupils are milky white i can
[16957.34s -> 16964.95s]  feel him climbing my coat you need to find a basement jesse's basement i remember it
[16965.83s -> 16973.03s]  it's right next to the tree the tree is too large so if you can't reach it from the top you've got
[16973.03s -> 16980.52s]  to try from the bottom find the basement and there surely you'll find the tree's roots the bloody
[16980.52s -> 16986.92s]  thing must have roots that's where they are destroy them hold them drag them twist the fuck out of
[16986.92s -> 16994.28s]  them you'll find a way i know you will the old man slides down my coat straight onto his destroyed
[16994.28s -> 17001.43s]  wheelchair for a moment he searches for his stone which he uses to prop himself up against the muddy
[17001.43s -> 17010.36s]  floor of the barn thank you thank you uh what's road the old man grabs the photo feels it and
[17010.36s -> 17015.80s]  then takes out a small glass object from his pocket and puts it to his eye the road home
[17015.80s -> 17024.10s]  what a load of bullshit the road of madness is what it is no one lives around her anymore
[17024.10s -> 17029.78s]  everyone is dead only sometimes sometimes i hear footsteps they wake me up at night
[17032.33s -> 17038.57s]  sound of bare feet against the floor and bells of sort they come out of nowhere they move towards
[17038.57s -> 17042.73s]  the trees then come back they pass me and fall silent they're like a nightmare a bloody nightmare
[17043.69s -> 17049.75s]  if you come across some wheels two little wheels so that i could fix my chair maybe
[17049.75s -> 17058.06s]  you'd benefit from it as well two wheels i had tires years ago when my eyes were good
[17058.06s -> 17063.42s]  people used to pass through here they would leave their huts and go there where that damn
[17063.42s -> 17069.80s]  tree grows they would often leave at night so that no one could see them they went into the
[17069.80s -> 17076.52s]  deep dark woods and never came back some of them would say they are going home but most of them
[17076.52s -> 17083.00s]  were silent i don't know the land has changed those trees have cut us off from the rest of the world
[17083.88s -> 17089.54s]  but home for me has always been here and that monstrous morning abomination grew out of the
[17089.54s -> 17094.26s]  ground it blocked the passage and that that no one has managed to pass through since then
[17095.38s -> 17100.02s]  maybe people found some other place maybe they died at the swamp just like us
[17100.98s -> 17110.79s]  what are you going on about again the wheelchair oh the war took me legs then those wankers burned
[17110.79s -> 17118.90s]  my house and me pigs but it was years after the war they said it was to fight the disease so they
[17118.90s -> 17125.46s]  said and my zocker the disease took her from me all i have is this wheelchair and this land
[17126.02s -> 17135.14s]  used to be different here first the woods changed trees start sprouting up everywhere we got caught
[17136.02s -> 17144.63s]  in a water flood in our fields people went crazy out of hunger they fall out of food they don't
[17144.63s -> 17156.50s]  they don't eat those what about what about their legs so destroy the tree i'll handle this grandpa
[17157.22s -> 17217.88s]  you got any stuff forks sickle this area is huge here's the tree destroy the tree all right i'll
[17217.88s -> 17248.86s]  take care can i get in here basement hatch oh fuck this is like a side quest the hatch leading to
[17248.86s -> 17252.22s]  the basement is blocked from the inside the marks on it suggests someone tried to break it open
[17252.78s -> 17293.02s]  how the fuck do i get in here is there any other way to go over here the tree is gigantic its bark
[17293.02s -> 17300.14s]  stays in constant motion it swells up and collapses into itself as if breathing i see human
[17300.14s -> 17304.38s]  silhouettes growing out of the tree trunk they're also moving as if gesturing in slow motion
[17305.50s -> 17312.95s]  dozens of miles repeat their lines simultaneously creating a uniform noisy murmur between the bows
[17313.03s -> 17318.23s]  i catch a man's gaze it's fixed on me his body similarly to the other beings
[17319.03s -> 17324.39s]  seems to form an integral part of the tree his limbs are gnarled and his face is grotesquely
[17324.39s -> 17329.51s]  deformed he's the only one to acknowledge my presence his hand slowly raises pointing to
[17329.51s -> 17335.61s]  something on the horizon above the roofs of the destroyed village the man's lips are moving but
[17335.61s -> 17342.68s]  the ghastly murmur of the other voices drowns out his words kick the tree hoping that the voice will
[17342.68s -> 17349.08s]  go silent try to climb the tree look at the lips of the person talking to me
[17350.28s -> 17354.92s]  even though the figure speaks sluggishly it is too high for me to read the lips properly
[17355.64s -> 17363.58s]  i think one of the words is radio the bark is slimy and soft its creases move away from my
[17363.58s -> 17368.38s]  shoes and hands i feel the arms that protrude from the roots tugging at my clothes i'm not sure if
[17368.38s -> 17373.50s]  they want to drag me down or pull me closer i barely break free from their grasp climbing
[17373.50s -> 17379.96s]  up is out of the question kick the tree i kicked the tree trunk with all my strength breaking a
[17379.96s -> 17386.04s]  branch sticking out from between the roots it hurts i hear a silent voice coming from beneath
[17386.04s -> 17392.12s]  my feet it's a face of a man who's grown into the root he's completely covered in bark his
[17392.12s -> 17398.04s]  lips barely stick above the mud and his raised arms resemble branches one of them is broken
[17398.04s -> 17402.36s]  in the elbow the stump leads a white gooey substance instead of seeping down it slowly
[17402.36s -> 17416.09s]  flows upward forming a new arm so just like a soul tree examine i notice a little smiling
[17416.09s -> 17420.65s]  face of a girl gazing at me from behind a cluster of sleeping heads oblivious to the chaos around
[17420.65s -> 17426.25s]  her she studies me with curiosity just next to her a massive man calmly humps a melody the lullaby
[17426.25s -> 17433.40s]  drowns in the overwhelming noise surrounding the tree i'm barely able to make out any conversations
[17433.40s -> 17439.85s]  and squabbles from the horrible noise of the tree boughs you took everything from us the shouts
[17439.93s -> 17444.49s]  come from an old man only the tip of his head and one of his arms stick out from between the
[17444.49s -> 17451.46s]  tightly crowded bodies you stole it thieves may the dogs piss on your faces right next to
[17451.46s -> 17458.20s]  him a woman's head wobbling from side to side repeats we were hungry we were hungry another
[17458.20s -> 17463.64s]  figure hiding its face under an enormous root lets out a chilling shriek quiet fucking quiet
[17463.64s -> 17470.38s]  leave us in peace shut up he is interrupted by a man next to him his intestines hanging up from
[17470.38s -> 17477.13s]  his stomach it was our common good it was meant for all of us you stole it are we going to go
[17477.13s -> 17483.77s]  through every single branch high above there's another guy that says hey fuck you how dare you
[17484.41s -> 17489.90s]  high above the top of the crown two silhouettes hanging from side to side from their hands and
[17489.90s -> 17498.70s]  legs grown to the trunk are trying to bite each other's faces off no it was mine it was mine it
[17498.70s -> 17513.58s]  actually was mine it was me it's me that was me this is you all right is there anything else so
[17513.58s -> 17529.46s]  the tree is made out of people potentially lots of people okay so the real question is
[17530.02s -> 17549.61s]  what the hell do i do now uh it's time to go home i've really collected very much stuff although
[17549.61s -> 17561.64s]  i will get another clip tomorrow hopefully nothing else i got a couple of things burn the tree i mean
[17561.64s -> 17565.64s]  if i can get down there i'm gonna put some gasoline on it and get rid of the damn thing
[17565.64s -> 17583.42s]  okay that's the idea all right i think i've i've got to get back i need okay the shovel
[17587.32s -> 17592.12s]  rubble dig in the rubble okay i can bring the shovel up there wow that's i actually did need

[17634.54s -> 17654.23s]  of here it's like giant maze over here no there's no way anybody saw that like it was parted look

[17672.79s -> 17679.30s]  and then try to find a way to get back into there's a couple of things that they said i want to look
[17679.30s -> 17709.93s]  at the journal the next morning i'll take the bear trap back home hooray let's craft antidote

[17728.26s -> 17743.59s]  okay so how are we doing make another one use this fill up okay this thing's pretty much empty
[17743.59s -> 17748.15s]  let's take up space bring the shovel back there tomorrow no i want to go check out the thing
[17748.71s -> 17760.78s]  all right i gotta cook first why are there so many bear traps but no let's get the fuck out of me
[17760.78s -> 17767.67s]  again why are there so many bear traps but no bears well because they're not made for bears
[17767.67s -> 17789.48s]  in this game they're married for people well there's the radio remember it was radio radio

[17897.66s -> 17908.70s]  i would advise against doing that something tells me that's probably not a smart idea
[17912.74s -> 17926.65s]  laughing my ass off let's board this up all right this is full health full health
[17926.65s -> 17932.28s]  how is this one doing didn't get touched i'm gonna remember the the idea is i'm gonna keep
[17932.28s -> 17941.98s]  this shit open and i'm gonna board this one up over here that's the idea i have to pee again
[17941.98s -> 17950.33s]  really badly so hopefully this goes well i want to get this here we're gonna put oh god damn it
[17950.33s -> 17968.26s]  it just creeped up on me right here board this one up frequent urination problem well i've drank
[17969.14s -> 17983.54s]  almost two full containers of this so it is a well-oiled machine it's pretty much what i do
[17983.54s -> 17989.38s]  every stream you just don't see it because i don't usually i'm not on camera but this is scary game
[17989.38s -> 17999.70s]  day the last four days in a row have been scary who's like okay i pay attention trap the only way
[17999.70s -> 18006.39s]  they can really get in is through here which let's just put one here i would know no i want
[18006.39s -> 18022.84s]  this here right there because i want to be able to stand behind it let's do another one no i don't
[18022.84s -> 18039.88s]  need to let's get the heel on there so i have i can heal all right i'm ready now if somebody
[18039.88s -> 18049.78s]  chases me i can run up here go around this corner and make them walk into this i might even no not
[18049.86s -> 18057.05s]  to this that's not that that's too much these are good down here this is barricaded here
[18057.85s -> 18066.01s]  the chair is going to move actually just get the damn thing out of the way
[18068.07s -> 18071.99s]  because it's just going to cause a problem when the guy eventually comes through the ground
[18071.99s -> 18093.82s]  we're doing gun here we go what about the centipede man centipede man spawns i'm running into this room
[18093.82s -> 18107.24s]  and baiting him into the trap go pee you'll be fine well that would be bad if i were just to leave
[18107.24s -> 18118.68s]  right now and that trap is not sitting right in front of the door so i should okay we'll see
[18119.32s -> 18137.19s]  well we got three shots in this before i have to reload it is lemon water intentionally you're
[18137.19s -> 18145.74s]  just that bad at making lemonade uh no the lemon water is it's intentional because i'm currently
[18145.74s -> 18156.66s]  on a fodmap diet and i can't have fructose corn syrup i can't have a lot of fruit shit but lemon
[18156.66s -> 18162.50s]  juice lemon juice is fine i can put a little bit in water lime juice and water and it's
[18162.50s -> 18167.94s]  like it's like drinking it's like drinking a soda let me have this okay i know it's not the same
[18167.94s -> 18229.90s]  thing is it a dog if it's dog it's getting the hammer all right why did i move is that making
[18229.90s -> 18242.22s]  noise i think that's loud okay something's coming into the ground i don't know what that is
[18258.22s -> 18311.00s]  what the fuck is that thing i just got dropped on that second that door opens
[18311.80s -> 18327.62s]  who opened the door how did you get in that room
[18377.19s -> 18406.39s]  multi-room strat works same deal putting trap there if i get diarrhea on i can go up here
[18406.39s -> 18413.82s]  anybody chases me i can go up here say vice versa throw go down this is a good spot i think
[18413.82s -> 18425.18s]  i'll be all right so for this day uh i am going to i need to look at the journal for a second
[18425.90s -> 18430.22s]  destroying the top he claims i first need to get the cellar to the cellar located near the tree
[18430.22s -> 18435.02s]  that's how i find its roots which i need to burn according to him it's the only way to get rid of
[18435.02s -> 18441.90s]  the abomination uh and advice from a blind deaf old man with no legs the only lead i have so far
[18441.90s -> 18452.68s]  it's not much but i've grown accustomed to it okay i saw the village that's the village of the tree
[18453.72s -> 18459.16s]  spare parts for the compressor the old journal also included information about a college cottage
[18459.16s -> 18464.44s]  located near the junkyard according to the notes i would be able to find some spare compressor parts
[18464.44s -> 18476.39s]  there they might come in handy broken compressor i'm going up that's all i got right now that's
[18476.39s -> 18483.45s]  literally all i got why no rifle because i'm afraid to use it because it has five shots
[18484.25s -> 18488.33s]  and i'll miss three of them and i'm not going to use it until the credits roll
[18488.97s -> 18495.59s]  because that's what i do in games like this would probably come in handy
[18497.54s -> 18510.66s]  or the shotgun you know what shotgun's coming with us we're gonna give you we'll use it but
[18510.66s -> 18679.51s]  i'm gonna pee because it's time to go to the bathroom i'll be right back hello wait every
[18679.51s -> 18686.70s]  break you gotta apply a little bit more balm what if i just turned the whole thing up like this and
[18686.78s -> 18704.84s]  just bit the top up and swallowed it i don't think this is low fog map slime action okay
[18705.88s -> 18711.32s]  so today we were going to uh this i like the strategy this is good we're gonna go investigate
[18711.32s -> 18722.76s]  cottage upstairs we're going up here cottage near the junkyard that way why does this feel
[18722.76s -> 18740.50s]  strange it's like it feels different is it backwards i was worried okay uh i'm ready to go
[18740.50s -> 18743.94s]  i don't have to do anything i've got heels i've got i'm gonna have to cook this stuff and
[18745.38s -> 18753.94s]  we should be fine i thought i stepped in a trap again i don't want to remove the uh wood here so
[18753.94s -> 18759.22s]  i'm gonna go around this stuff i don't need to dismantle it what's the point of dismantling it
[18759.22s -> 18782.74s]  when i can just go like this and push this back tonight good turn off the generator
[18785.42s -> 18796.47s]  level up we're at probably the final level adrenaline i will deal double damage in melee
[18796.47s -> 18804.33s]  when close to death my vitality will increase once a day i'll be able to become invisible to
[18804.33s -> 18811.58s]  enemies if i stay still healing items will be less effective and my accuracy decreases
[18811.58s -> 18825.78s]  oh no this is okay probably the vitality or invisibility how long does that last
[18826.34s -> 18855.24s]  my accuracy will be less effective in shooting how much more i wonder done so i've got a little bit
[18855.24s -> 18865.94s]  more health there that's pretty good i thought i was really expecting a full cube i don't like
[18865.94s -> 18878.42s]  a half a cube feel a little uh feel a little ripped off all right i haven't even looked in here
[18879.46s -> 18887.45s]  so i need to craft a few things for instance i need to talk to the trader down here
[18889.13s -> 18904.04s]  buy my daily magazine my daily scrap my daily magazine my daily bullet my daily rags and
[18904.84s -> 18922.39s]  that's good i'll do the pills too yeah you can have a sickle my daily vroom
[18924.07s -> 18929.19s]  all right let's get the shot i don't even have a shotgun i've left the shotgun doesn't is not here
[18929.19s -> 18945.03s]  here i don't own a shotgun single shot shotgun where do i get that those pliers i haven't seen
[18945.03s -> 18953.02s]  them at all single shot shotgun so i need i had need the weapon i don't have the weapon parts
[18953.02s -> 18980.15s]  either i'm gonna have to keep this blade is i'll bring the hunting rifle this thing has one shot
[18981.03s -> 18984.07s]  i'm going to take one bullet with me extra
[18990.07s -> 19001.50s]  how many pills do i have three uh i'm gonna bring some wood to eat
[19006.47s -> 19021.53s]  i left at the last island yeah just eat this now it's not a great heal actually it's pretty bad
[19022.49s -> 19039.48s]  that's really bad well unfortunately for me that's gonna have to do
[19040.52s -> 19050.66s]  okay i'm bringing a barrel too yeah and no i'm not going that way yet i'll bring yeah
[19051.46s -> 19056.62s]  just in case of something else lock picks a couple of batteries my watch i don't think
[19056.62s -> 19074.30s]  i need this many magazines but uh yes i do do you ever looks like the guy who gave me the wrong
[19074.38s -> 19085.38s]  order at olive garden i would get your order right every time that looks good i got some
[19085.38s -> 19092.58s]  pills i got pills i've got bread i got i got now guys i've got i've got never-ending garlic bread
[19094.92s -> 19118.90s]  from olive garden we're going up here let's try it see what i can do investigate up here we go whoops
[19119.54s -> 19125.10s]  that's just good stuff i'll take it
[19125.58s -> 19138.20s]  i don't know why i did that just eat some fucking never-ending garlic wood i used it at least i
[19138.20s -> 19179.42s]  used it all right no more wood don't need i don't need to take anymore all right look for a compressor
[19179.42s -> 19197.10s]  thing right that's a hidden bear trap i'll take it starting to run out of space already no no don't
[19197.10s -> 19207.03s]  take the wood i can i can go on like a scavenge if i need to put the wooden
[19207.11s -> 19209.83s]  i can i can go on like a scavenge if i need to put the wooden
[19211.59s -> 19227.94s]  and the mushrooms and shit no no it's not necessary he spits
[19234.55s -> 19267.24s]  die motherfucker i used it it's too hard to see that shit it really is how many bullets does it
[19267.24s -> 19276.66s]  take to kill one of those how i gotta go up really is that that's not even that's out of the bounds
[19276.66s -> 19289.69s]  that's out of the map this accuracy is actually really really starting to be a pain in the ass
[19290.33s -> 19303.03s]  i can scavenge for it another time i oh i'm i'm here now this looks like this is out of balance
[19308.81s -> 19339.18s]  eat a piece of wood what the fuck is that what is that poisoned i ain't fucking with that thing
[19339.90s -> 19349.53s]  just put it on the hot bar i'm gonna be chewing on wood this whole time
[19350.33s -> 19365.11s]  oh i can't do it from the hot bar it's an alien artifact all right there's apparently some
[19365.11s -> 19382.63s]  cottage near a junkyard over here another one of these okay i'm at the sawmill i don't understand
[19382.63s -> 19421.61s]  what i'm supposed to do about those things this map is lying to me right now i got it mushrooms
[19422.41s -> 19436.44s]  i have to watch out for how's the doctor again he looks bad this land hides more secrets than your
[19436.44s -> 19442.01s]  little fucking rat brain is capable of understanding the doctor digs through the mud i think he's
[19442.01s -> 19447.54s]  looking for something deep underground there's a current of electricity fucking electricity
[19448.02s -> 19451.62s]  he starts flailing his arms around wildly throwing pieces of mud everywhere around him
[19452.26s -> 19457.53s]  and it flows underground from tree to tree the doctor suddenly freezes staring at me with his
[19457.53s -> 19464.25s]  arms mid-air and it powers everything it connects it all if i had a light bulb if i just screwed it
[19464.25s -> 19469.77s]  into one of these branches it would light up i bet it fucking would it bends over a small hole
[19469.77s -> 19478.55s]  in the mud and continues digging maybe this is where you're hiding maybe this is the way bolt
[19478.55s -> 19494.49s]  handle should i get the bolt handle or a weapon part i don't know which one to do do the embryo
[19494.49s -> 19505.48s]  instead the bolt handle is a weapon part that's a shitload of bad that's like two thousand three
[19505.48s -> 19511.29s]  thousand essence what whatever i can make with the bolt handle i'll try to make it
[19513.38s -> 19519.45s]  let's go got it can you hear the trees sing they're calling us they're showing us the way
[19519.45s -> 19527.58s]  they're showing us the way all at the same time blocking it i can't understand it he kicks a stone
[19527.58s -> 19532.06s]  are they trying to tell us something are they putting us to a test i don't know maybe they're
[19532.06s -> 19541.08s]  lost too and don't know what to do he shakes his head dispirited and goes silent still got that
[19541.08s -> 19545.88s]  cigarette though after a long pause he turns toward me his glasses are so dirty i can barely see the
[19545.88s -> 19551.34s]  eyes hiding beneath them i see you haven't regained your speech you need to find another
[19551.34s -> 19558.41s]  doctor i haven't slept a wink in many days i don't think this is good for me i hear this voice all
[19558.41s -> 19566.04s]  the time can you hear it her heavenly voice the doctor stares right into my eyes mud drips from
[19566.04s -> 19570.36s]  his face he hasn't blinked in over a minute no you don't why would you you don't know her
[19571.56s -> 19576.84s]  he steps towards me and lowers his voice i'm a bit fed up with her i've bit a little tiny bit
[19577.56s -> 19582.84s]  she must know i'm heading her way i'm doing everything i can i don't eat i don't sleep i
[19582.84s -> 19587.32s]  search under every rock under every fucking bush she must understand it she must give me some time
[19587.32s -> 19596.71s]  some little time off tell her this will you kind of losing it here the doctor is lost in thoughts
[19596.71s -> 19602.23s]  a cigarette sticks out of his mud covered mouth he's in what remains of his shoe he draws lines
[19602.23s -> 19609.21s]  on the ground they seem to intersect in completely random places i'm waiting he doesn't stop drawing
[19609.21s -> 19615.45s]  he moves away a bit and makes a wide arc with his heel four the doctor flicks his cigarette into
[19615.45s -> 19619.05s]  the dirt stomps on it and drags it along the ground creating the last straight line
[19620.17s -> 19649.54s]  you fuck trying was never my forte okay doc goodbye fish come on oh shit all right i can't
[19649.78s -> 19671.24s]  that uh who are you who are you i'm here are you trapped i'm here i'm here i'm trapped i'm
[19671.24s -> 19689.14s]  i might be trapped i'm trapped i'm here i hear hear her i hear her i hear cut me loose i can't i
[19689.22s -> 19718.54s]  tried what is that a giant snail what the fuck is that apparently this is the cottage
[19719.42s -> 19732.92s]  the shell is cracked maybe i could break it open should i do that what if it comes out
[19745.64s -> 19752.12s]  whoa rook beneath the shell is completely destroyed the snail shell is probably also
[19752.12s -> 19756.68s]  badly damaged maybe i'd be able to get inside the cottage through the skin on his belly it
[19756.68s -> 19784.68s]  seems quite frail are you the snail speech is incredibly slow creamily and slurred he moves
[19784.68s -> 19790.28s]  his jaw with great effort it looks like it's about to fall off his eyes sag from their sockets they
[19790.28s -> 19799.96s]  dangle from side to side trying to keep me in their sight why are you disturbing my forced
[19801.53s -> 19812.65s]  rest his right eye raises with great effort and wobbles your face what happened to your face
[19813.37s -> 19825.61s]  your hair looks like shit today man let me sorry i've been drinking the chemicals
[19827.29s -> 19834.14s]  stove again the snail's jaw falls so low it almost detached itself from the rest of the body
[19835.61s -> 19848.34s]  you scared me you barely resemble a human cover yourself suddenly i feel a subtle shiver
[19848.34s -> 19856.26s]  beneath my feet the snail's body livens up quiet you hear that do you hear that voice
[19857.06s -> 19865.61s]  the snail tucks his head inside his shell she calls to me can you hear it she's calling to me
[19865.61s -> 19869.05s]  i'm here trapped bound
[19873.54s -> 19877.06s]  the snail falls silent for a long above with the inside of the shell is almost completely silent
[19877.70s -> 19882.26s]  the snail's body suddenly leans forward the wooden construction of the cottage
[19882.26s -> 19894.28s]  creaks under his huge bulk i barely keep my balance cut me loose please i need to get out here if you
[19894.36s -> 19906.07s]  release me i will leave come back tomorrow and i won't be here anymore you can live in my home
[19906.63s -> 19917.51s]  you like it you just need to cut me loose the snail falls silent his enormous head slowly drops
[19917.51s -> 19925.58s]  to the shell giant gleaming drops of mucus appear in his slimy skin you need to understand my
[19926.60s -> 19936.01s]  predicament i'm unable to do anything by myself my legs are numb from lying here
[19936.82s -> 19943.86s]  i can't feel my arms at all i've been lying in the sun gives me this strange pleasure
[19944.98s -> 19954.10s]  but it's time for me to go understand i love you that's not what that says understand i have to
[19954.10s -> 19971.18s]  photo of the road you're going there too everyone is going there it's the world home after all
[19974.04s -> 19980.57s]  once there was a beautiful clearing now everything's coming in water and i've lost
[19980.57s -> 19993.78s]  my gumboots do you have any gumboots on you you're so ugly i feel like puking you barely
[19993.78s -> 20008.15s]  resemble a human being i found work today it was yesterday or a few days ago maybe a year
[20009.03s -> 20016.31s]  i woke up in front of the house i thought i was dreaming i took a step and fell down
[20016.31s -> 20030.33s]  i fell straight through the roof how did this happen uh so i have to cut him loose
[20030.41s -> 20053.16s]  the shells please throw the snow so how do i cut them loose pour salt on him you maniac
[20061.24s -> 20065.80s]  it was blocked by rubble i must find a different way inside
[20067.56s -> 20089.05s]  what is from his shell the shells completely destroyed the shells completely destroyed the
[20089.05s -> 20101.58s]  snail shells probably also badly damaged his skin on his belly it looks like a human hand
[20102.22s -> 20107.82s]  but it's sticky and grown into the shell the key grows out of the palm i should be able to easily
[20107.82s -> 20129.98s]  tear it off key found shed key key to the shed where's there a shed
[20143.34s -> 20164.54s]  i'd get them off maybe a knife some kind of organic cords they're slowly pulsating they're
[20164.54s -> 20185.32s]  surprisingly hard and durable board some kind of cord some kind of cord
[20186.68s -> 20202.92s]  organic cord is this like i can i just like to kill again i can't go anywhere else over here
[20204.68s -> 20231.11s]  i would think i'd have to follow this around somewhere oh look bear trap many nails and
[20231.19s -> 20235.67s]  planks some useful scrap metal gun oh this is it okay
[20241.34s -> 20249.10s]  useful scrap metal gun parts at sea ropes tapes antlers some tools scrap metal
[20250.30s -> 20284.70s]  an old an old compressor f f right here yep so what tools may be equals pliers
[20285.10s -> 20289.18s]  so i don't understand this though maybe can i just not do this or do i have to do something
[20289.18s -> 20296.89s]  it is a snail over here it's getting late i need to figure this out before i leave though
[20297.85s -> 20308.66s]  wardrobe door it's i mean i could cut him in the stomach but i don't want to kill him
[20309.94s -> 20318.06s]  isn't that gonna want to kill him that's a good everyone a bunch of people just said
[20318.14s -> 20321.98s]  a bunch of people just said just cut his stomach open it's like that's gonna kill him
[20322.54s -> 20346.82s]  let me see this one more time boots he says cut me loose dude i can't i i'll come back
[20347.78s -> 20386.42s]  that's i'm running out of time i gotta go i feel like there's something i gotta have to leave
[20387.62s -> 20453.86s]  all right it's something to do with this close now i i don't know what i'm supposed to do
[20453.86s -> 20468.63s]  am i supposed to cut this i i don't is this is this letting him go i i don't know what this what
[20468.63s -> 20475.59s]  i'm supposed to be doing i don't have time to know either what am i trying to do here
[20477.08s -> 20485.77s]  like block the light i don't have time to this to do this okay am i trying to have i don't know what

[20683.85s -> 20688.79s]  i'm pretty much immune to it at this point it's happened so many times
[20689.35s -> 20709.64s]  i gotta turn on the generator turn it on before it gets too dark what is that it's an alien okay go
[20710.52s -> 20723.50s]  through house no i have to go through i have to go through this side because remember 48 50
[20732.97s -> 20761.50s]  right at the fucking last second oh fuck i got heels right i have one heel i have any more wood
[20761.50s -> 20789.18s]  eat it no you fucking fool you fool you fool you were supposed to board it

[20884.47s -> 20906.26s]  fucking noise wood eat wood i'm gonna fucking blow this place to hell
[20950.14s -> 20991.70s]  do the scream all right wait there's still an hour there's still an hour guys this ain't done
[20992.26s -> 21020.62s]  is it a dog coming in 26 250 rep all right i can't believe i did it i can't believe i made it
[21026.44s -> 21048.63s]  time to move my house to the snail house same deal all the things that i like
[21053.77s -> 21078.42s]  now i did get a weapon part so let me just let me check that out let's be chefs 960 essence it's
[21078.42s -> 21085.70s]  not very much the bolt is for a rifle i kind of already have one huh well i guess i could sell
[21085.70s -> 21102.63s]  it after i make it or i could just sell apart all right workbench it's not even i don't even
[21102.63s -> 21119.00s]  have access to it 225 though it sells for good ammo and the rifle i could i could use a couple
[21119.00s -> 21127.34s]  more batteries if i'm honest all right we have traps and two traps that should be good for the
[21127.34s -> 21134.25s]  next night i'm gonna use them to fill some gasoline up i need a couple more batteries
[21134.89s -> 21146.15s]  how do i make batteries can i no should i take i'm gonna take these heels do i have the yeah
[21146.15s -> 21156.12s]  actually they're right here i'd rather do this take the good ones and spare parts i got lots
[21156.12s -> 21162.10s]  of spare parts now rotten mushrooms oh shit they sat in there for too long didn't they
[21162.98s -> 21168.74s]  fuck whatever i'll bring one of these bringing the shovel too just in case we're going to fill up
[21168.74s -> 21181.72s]  the other we're going to use the gasoline heels food and bullets i'll take two that makes sense
[21181.72s -> 21191.75s]  to me all right let's go repair the axe i don't think no it doesn't need to get waste now i have
[21191.75s -> 21200.89s]  a new house this is true so should i just run with a bunch of stuff to the new house
[21201.77s -> 21212.39s]  is the cottage not a hideout now the cottage is not a hideout oh shit okay well that's good
[21212.39s -> 21227.58s]  to know all right that's good let's refill some of this stuff the rest of this and then let's fill
[21227.58s -> 21257.93s]  up the generator how much is in the generator yeah i could use it oh top this off all right cool
[21259.13s -> 21265.29s]  i'm good i've already dealt with you but there's anything else i need
[21270.73s -> 21280.55s]  i'll take a pill yeah yeah give me some more pills all right let's go up to the house the snail
[21280.55s -> 21283.99s]  house because now it's another day so it's technically you shouldn't be there anymore
[21284.95s -> 21295.64s]  let's go i want to examine that i turned off the generator right can two thousand of you confirm
[21295.64s -> 21316.31s]  prepare the windows oh smart smart how's this one doing i'll just put them all up i was going
[21316.31s -> 21340.49s]  to redo the whole thing fucking stupid eye ah let's get all the wood i should have enough to
[21340.49s -> 21365.37s]  do at least enough nails too okay kind of run out of nails see what i can do with this wood
[21365.93s -> 21379.88s]  what i gotta grind him up you know got enough gas for me to do that come on
[21379.88s -> 21398.52s]  general you ever think about taking the l like taking the loss i mean what do you mean i'm like
[21398.52s -> 21402.36s]  i'm like probably an hour or two away from beating the game why would i take a loss right now
[21403.16s -> 21422.04s]  it's good do i have enough i do not have enough do i know i need more nails that's okay i can
[21422.04s -> 21427.88s]  finish this when i come back because it's just these it's just this door here i'm gonna retrap
[21427.88s -> 21447.27s]  though because that's the way that we're going to do this i have two in there two okay one two
[21448.55s -> 21460.97s]  make another one three should do it i think i'm happy with three yeah three should be fine
[21463.03s -> 21484.90s]  so in the usual places i also wanted batteries too but i don't think i can i not make batteries
[21485.70s -> 21515.03s]  okay and then i do i want one up here please remind me that this exists again
[21518.62s -> 21523.50s]  i will cause a huge problem if i do not know and i'm gonna i have time to put this over here
[21523.50s -> 21543.67s]  you're gonna like it through we move how's my inventory look actually pretty dog shit so hold
[21543.67s -> 21558.30s]  on got enough bullets this is my healing boards my pills my batteries my shovel my piss bottle
[21559.02s -> 21562.86s]  it's a little kind of kind of overkill on the healing here yeah overkill on the healing get
[21562.86s -> 21588.76s]  this out of here off we go let's check out the snail hut see what's in there now
[21589.88s -> 21633.02s]  almost stepped in it but i didn't where the fuck is the snail he's gone he went away at least he
[21633.02s -> 21642.22s]  told me he went away he might have been a liar we'll find out what if he's still there yeah he
[21642.22s -> 21652.38s]  said he was gonna leave yeah he should be gone better be or he's got a real soft belly is what
[21652.38s -> 21668.18s]  i've been told i need some wood it's actually a good opportunity to take wooden nails okay
[21669.37s -> 21682.95s]  here we go let's see what's in this place up in the snail cavern here we go
[21683.83s -> 21735.19s]  did he leave he left radio this expensive shit no map location found radio tower
[21735.75s -> 21746.74s]  now leave the rope it's useless to me a lot of rusty radio equipment is turned on the floor
[21746.74s -> 21751.06s]  old recorders and destroyed tapes everything's covered in goo dripping from the leaky ceiling
[21753.72s -> 21771.37s]  dead body the dry corpse overgrown with small roots okay so i got the map i got the radio tower
[21771.93s -> 21795.66s]  oh my god that's so far away i guess we go to the radio tower well that was is that the snail
[21796.62s -> 21802.34s]  that's everything that's oh no folks we have nothing to eat since the flood i've caught some
[21802.34s -> 21808.44s]  snails and frogs better this than nothing out of the crosswords i found last year in the old
[21808.44s -> 21812.74s]  wardrobe at the junkyard the only thing that's left is to continue writing the journal and
[21812.74s -> 21818.12s]  listening to the strange radio in two days i will visit the junkyard again maybe i'll finally find
[21818.12s -> 21821.96s]  a tape recorder or something that will allow me to record this weird signal here there's some
[21821.96s -> 21828.44s]  meaning behind it i'm hungry i'm eating grass and whatever i find in the water i've seen some
[21828.44s -> 21835.94s]  strange men between the trees they're not locals they do not hide they were dressed in strange
[21835.94s -> 21842.60s]  clothes but i was too far to take a better look besides i'm alone and there were at least three
[21842.60s -> 21848.73s]  of them maybe i'm delusional maybe these old ruins aren't empty i found a blank tape and
[21848.73s -> 21853.40s]  a broken tape recorder maybe i can fix it and do something with it i've also found some other
[21853.40s -> 21859.42s]  useful things i've written them down and left them for father later i don't have the strength
[21859.42s -> 21864.73s]  to wear them all on my back is it possible that the radio tower emits the strange signal it's
[21864.73s -> 21869.05s]  been a couple of years since it's been turned over the woods have blocked the way to it
[21870.01s -> 21875.94s]  but no other signal reaches this place from outside it must be that tower i need to take
[21875.94s -> 21879.38s]  a break from this radio i hear this voice everywhere it's strangely familiar i can't
[21879.38s -> 21943.69s]  get it out of my head okay so i can't the radio tower i can't get to the radio tower
[21944.33s -> 21967.91s]  but the junkyard read this now where's the compressor parts the junkyard so that's like
[21967.91s -> 22002.20s]  down here well i need like my item of notes not this one this one scrap metal an old compressor
[22002.20s -> 22015.13s]  was f which is up here but is that up this way is it my in it right now or is that like up here
[22015.13s -> 22029.35s]  it's probably the map yeah that makes sense so i'm gonna go i'm gonna get the compressor
[22030.52s -> 22045.43s]  sticking with the plan or junkyard or map i mean the junkyard is right here
[22046.23s -> 22075.32s]  you might as well just take a look at it see what's over here junkyard it's a map of the
[22075.32s -> 22089.94s]  junkyard okay f so we need to go in the top right corner junkyard like up here oh i have to dig
[22090.90s -> 22105.80s]  need point three have point four is this the right spot though there's another spot over there
[22106.52s -> 22138.44s]  do it oh yes got it do this one too wait what else is up here uh f is scrap metal and old
[22138.44s -> 22146.20s]  compressor and clothes clothes broken axe empty bottles some fine quality clothing at h
[22150.02s -> 22164.97s]  f b one of these is h which one the one right below me a b c a b c d e where's that one
[22165.61s -> 22173.86s]  do i even have to do this again i don't i can't do it again i got what i needed i got what i came
[22173.86s -> 22189.54s]  for time to go fix the compressor nice go get the fine clothes like i have to dig don't i have to
[22189.54s -> 22193.78s]  dig in here i don't i my shovels i have to don't have to dig what are you talking about
[22194.66s -> 22208.41s]  don't i i my my shovel don't work no more i'm running out of space too i guess i pick it
[22211.06s -> 22227.80s]  no will you what the fuck happened to it okay i'll make a lock pick wait rocket wreckage
[22230.65s -> 22247.10s]  oh no oh no it's him he didn't make it he did not make it i'm gonna make some heals
[22247.90s -> 22261.59s]  an inventory what the fuck do i get rid of the stumps i have to get rid of this lock pick i
[22261.59s -> 22278.25s]  just made who cares that's sad this long gun take the scrap i want this long barrel let's just like
[22278.25s -> 22295.94s]  see what this does who cares long barrel weapon part scrap compressor i need the stumps though
[22296.02s -> 22301.61s]  and it either nails the wood for the weapon part this is worth so much money
[22302.25s -> 22323.14s]  nice all right i'm out that's sad he didn't make it unfortunately i have to go this way
[22323.70s -> 22343.96s]  all right come on let's do this i can search wait what i can search both wreckages what the fuck
[22345.00s -> 22350.68s]  i got no room for it though what is this thing tubular magazine i don't have any space for this
[22351.32s -> 22372.66s]  i just gotta come back i'll come back later it's getting late i gotta get out of here i can't i
[22372.66s -> 22380.09s]  have two complete items that i was looking for so bad it's not like it's gonna fly away
[22382.22s -> 22410.26s]  that's true that's that's terrible did runner already yes i did hello no just don't i can't
[22410.26s -> 22437.80s]  take it complete this down here bear trap watch it grabbing the nails that's all i'm looking for
[22437.80s -> 22451.24s]  right now board up the stuff live another day and then i'm gonna fix the compressor
[22454.01s -> 22466.87s]  and upgrade the barracks i remembered this time examine where is it over here let's just put this
[22466.87s -> 22480.57s]  away first let's upgrade the workbench i need three wires of course i do i can make a shotgun
[22480.57s -> 22495.24s]  now though that actually doesn't break okay let me go let's do that let's put the compressor in
[22495.96s -> 22518.65s]  the rag no give me the what am i doing i need to make this wood i need gas i need pliers later
[22519.61s -> 22523.02s]  hunting rifle can stay i need batteries
[22527.08s -> 22562.41s]  all right i have no idea what's gonna happen we'll find out cool six hours yeah um we're just gonna
[22562.41s -> 22571.06s]  go till this is done i feel like i it's i've got a little more i've got like probably a couple
[22571.06s -> 22578.54s]  hours maybe but we're just gonna go to this is done i think that's the best idea all right so
[22579.26s -> 22594.46s]  compressor here you are repair working compressor i could refill any empty oxygen tanks here
[22595.26s -> 22607.90s]  i don't have any empty oxygen tanks oxygen tanks rusty oxygen tanks they're useless
[22608.70s -> 22628.87s]  well shit okay i've got my weapons i'm almost ready to board up for the night i'm gonna cook this
[22629.75s -> 22633.59s]  store the weapon parts you know keep the wood because i needed to board up in case something
[22633.59s -> 22643.22s]  bad happens i don't need this many nails though not like it matters still have heals
[22645.32s -> 22655.75s]  batteries put the rags away and it's time it's time beater beater what are you what are you guys
[22655.75s -> 22669.37s]  saying peter i'll switch it on now no i don't need to do that now yeah yeah just do it now no
[22669.37s -> 22674.01s]  it's a waste yeah it's a waste it's a waste it's a waste it's a waste it's a waste it's a waste
[22674.65s -> 22682.20s]  let me make sure everything's ready to go so this door is boarded boarded boarded traps traps
[22682.92s -> 22697.03s]  trap exploding barrel thing over here same scenario gonna hang out down here put this back
[22697.75s -> 22715.53s]  don't want light coming through so that's a little bit of light going through i think that's good
[22716.17s -> 22726.14s]  it's that that's fine all right this is gonna be moved over here actually that's all right right
[22726.14s -> 22741.56s]  there here we go you know what board it up i don't want this walking in here close the doors
[22744.58s -> 22756.79s]  board it up i didn't cook the i didn't cook the mushroom i did not cook it i did not this time
[22757.51s -> 22796.52s]  i did not i did not cook the mushroom i did not i did not did i really say it like that i don't
[22796.52s -> 22866.63s]  think i did come on why am i not saying anything because my brain can only do one thing at a time
[22867.80s -> 22882.47s]  uh i have to concentrate when i'm doing something like this i can't speak i love
[22882.47s -> 22889.86s]  cynical germa what do you mean i'm incredibly optimistic i'm incredibly i'm incredibly
[22889.86s -> 22906.42s]  optimistic about this i i've got it cynical i'm not cynical cynical enfp all right just don't move
[22907.38s -> 22910.98s]  in fact if anybody comes in here they get in the axe anyways maybe they won't
[22910.98s -> 22914.34s]  i might get spawned on like three times and then the bear i'm just shooting the barrel
[22917.59s -> 22925.42s]  so while we sit here at night what's the game plan for tomorrow game plan for tomorrow is wires
[22925.42s -> 22938.76s]  to upgrade i need to get oxygen tanks i'm gonna say maybe ted out this way take a look over there
[22938.76s -> 22963.83s]  all right here we go this is where they come up finish looting the rocket yeah maybe i don't
[22963.83s -> 22971.32s]  maybe i don't maybe i don't need it what was in there that i needed i've got a hunting rifle
[22971.32s -> 22978.02s]  the thing is sick into the stream voice no i'm playing this until i'm done
[22980.74s -> 22996.30s]  no i'm not into the stream what are we talking about i've just got some eye goopies or you know
[22996.30s -> 23001.86s]  sometimes you just sit here and you get a blink a few times all right this is where it starts
[23001.86s -> 23008.95s]  i gotta get ready i have not heard anything yet i think i got some good light drainage over here
[23008.95s -> 23027.67s]  so that's probably why i fatigue are we gonna go a full night without anybody showing up to our
[23027.67s -> 23041.34s]  front door this would be phenomenal this would be great i'd be really happy about this don't spend
[23041.34s -> 23051.78s]  one single round swing an axe once in the swamp late game that would be fantastic let me get the
[23051.78s -> 23116.34s]  random dumb roll the one time in the nearly 20 hours i've played this game four a.m it's not
[23116.34s -> 23168.28s]  gonna happen six a.m hey come on over here i've been here trying to come find me nothing we were
[23168.28s -> 23198.81s]  250 dollars very cool oxygen tanks always buy scrap always buy things always buy magazine always
[23198.81s -> 23214.94s]  buy bullet always buy pill but wires too shit i fucked up a little bit here i may have fucked
[23214.94s -> 23235.56s]  up a little bit here what's shiny down here there are some footprints on the floor
[23236.20s -> 23241.93s]  the door handle is covered with slime
[23257.40s -> 23270.10s]  excuse me excuse me dead musician holy shit he's got a huge bag
[23274.54s -> 23284.47s]  he's got a giant bag this is awesome oh my god i'm gonna put so much stuff in here can i drag
[23284.47s -> 23302.82s]  him up here this is perfect whoa is that not supposed to kill that person what well this is
[23302.82s -> 23316.49s]  still very useful to me oh well there's a lot of stuff i can't wait to spread out my stuff okay
[23317.29s -> 23337.99s]  i need three oh thanks to the stone too shiny stone what's wrong with my brain
[23338.95s -> 23350.81s]  okay what else do i want to sell i'm gonna make i'm gonna make the single shot shotgun are you
[23350.81s -> 23366.95s]  ready three two one no i was waiting for someone to say something wait i was waiting for someone
[23366.95s -> 23375.56s]  to convert just to tell me not to do this okay good to know all right i'm gonna sell this and
[23375.56s -> 23384.33s]  now i'm gonna get some wires what do you need for the better shotgun i need to upgrade this
[23384.33s -> 23389.69s]  stupid workbench first give me the wires they shake their head no we'll take a shiny stone
[23389.69s -> 23398.68s]  instead i need wires i need one wire and i can upgrade the workbench probably for the last
[23398.68s -> 23414.10s]  time one more wire i don't have one that sucks big time um store that clip three shots in the
[23414.10s -> 23424.25s]  hunting rifle a bunch of wires at the rocket rocket ship time yeah we'll go we'll go let's
[23424.25s -> 23429.45s]  go loot everything at the rocket ship store everything i get to repair the shovel though
[23429.45s -> 23440.47s]  don't i yes i do okay take that with me i got my these this is overkill for heels don't need the

[23632.62s -> 23646.65s]  the doctor turns his mud-covered head towards the sun and freezes then he spreads his arms
[23646.65s -> 23654.30s]  along his sides warm a chunk of mud falls down on his exposed tongue he chews it slowly and
[23654.30s -> 23671.93s]  swallows it with satisfaction i'll take the embryo it's might as well try to level up
[23672.57s -> 23681.27s]  before it's over the doctor puts the muddy hand into his mouth premises and pulls out a yellow
[23681.27s -> 23686.63s]  tooth he puts it into his pocket of his torn trousers the tooth falls through a hole he does
[23686.63s -> 23691.51s]  not notice this the doctor begins staring at a nearby tree trunk paying no attention to the
[23691.51s -> 23697.91s]  blood flowing between his lips the doctor glances at me he tilts his head sideways lost in thought
[23698.87s -> 23703.91s]  after a moment he extends his hand towards me as if wanting to grab me by the throat but stops
[23704.39s -> 23710.65s]  he freezes slowly he bends down and grabs a thick branch from the ground he starts biting the bark
[23710.65s -> 23716.09s]  off of it he swallows the bark with an effort but also great satisfaction he places the stick
[23716.09s -> 23720.49s]  among the other sticking out from the mud-covered head out from his mud-covered head
[23721.69s -> 23728.86s]  doctor approached me i can feel him embracing me why am i letting him do this i hear his horse

[24542.98s -> 24598.86s]  maybe a little bit more over this way come on in oh man sometimes you gotta stretch
[24598.86s -> 24608.47s]  just stretch it up can you please write how you like your eggs cooked in descending order best to
[24608.47s -> 24618.87s]  worst sure s tier s plus no match completely unmatched is a hard-boiled egg that has a jammy
[24618.87s -> 24627.26s]  yolk but not too soft jammy but not too soft and it has to be hot i'm talking right out of the
[24628.54s -> 24641.03s]  boiling water you peel it a little bit of salt hot yep s plus tier over hard no over medium
[24641.03s -> 24648.76s]  but like almost almost too hard very close incredibly close so from there a fresh
[24648.76s -> 24659.35s]  hard-boiled egg right there bang s somewhere at a is a over medium egg like fried on a flat top
[24659.35s -> 24664.87s]  i don't like over easy over easy is down somewhere at f i do not like a runny egg it gets everywhere
[24665.43s -> 24672.84s]  i it's it's not to me it is not cooked it's not fully cooked all the way but let me hold on
[24673.08s -> 24676.12s]  let me i know people are probably gonna get really upset about this but let me try to read right what
[24676.12s -> 24683.08s]  i'm trying to say here so there is over easy which is good where the egg is cooked but there
[24683.08s -> 24690.28s]  are people that do over easy where they they only cook the part of the egg that is the white part
[24690.92s -> 24696.34s]  that's i don't like that and you it's literally raw in the middle if raw egg in the middle is
[24696.34s -> 24704.39s]  not appetizing to me at all um an over medium egg with a jammy middle bingo that's a also on
[24704.39s -> 24713.53s]  the a tier i would put a poached egg poached egg sits right up next to over medium in fact poached
[24713.53s -> 24723.91s]  egg might also be up at s in fact i'm gonna have to say it is yes exposed by kim what did kim say
[24724.47s -> 24737.70s]  let me expose what what what what did she say poached his s yes poached egg on toast
[24738.50s -> 24743.78s]  he likes his egg well done no i like it i like it like like 10 to 12 minutes and hard boiled
[24746.22s -> 24759.42s]  where scrambled um scrambled is like b i think medium no no i like it like over medium to over
[24759.42s -> 24770.73s]  hard she said you like your eggs completely raw that's that's absolute horseshit no you guys are
[24771.29s -> 24783.93s]  that's that's a joke blue egg rare eggs there's no such thing as a rare egg you either cook an egg
[24783.93s -> 24794.81s]  or you don't all right you um you got me all twisted here hard boiled egg is at top fresh out
[24794.81s -> 24803.22s]  of the boiling water crack open peel rinse salt maybe a little bit of pepper and then blah over
[24803.22s -> 24812.01s]  medium best egg that's on the flat top cooked over medium sunny side up looks cool in pictures
[24813.67s -> 24823.51s]  no thank you i don't get that cartoon shit out of here looks it looks cool in pictures um scrambled
[24823.51s -> 24829.19s]  eggs are somewhere around the b tier i love them i'll lead them i love eggs by the way by the way
[24829.19s -> 24845.82s]  an f in my egg tier list is pretty high because i love eggs let's just click on the link i make
[24845.82s -> 24852.42s]  you ovaries eggs all the time no but you but you don't know you you do it hold on you do it in a
[24852.42s -> 24861.91s]  way that's not the egg is not like raw in the middle it's runny but it's it's malleable it's
[24861.91s -> 24871.43s]  jammy it drains out it's not just like water people do the water shit where you it's water in there
[24871.43s -> 24877.72s]  over media you know you know that over medium is my favorite you know that okay kim is over medium

[28910.65s -> 28920.73s]  and dies from a calorie induced religious nightmare like i've been fasting for like eight hours
[28922.17s -> 28928.90s]  that's fucking funny all right let's go
[28928.90s -> 28939.50s]  go

[29088.65s -> 29096.86s]  me realistically how much time is left in the game like what how much how much is left for me
[29096.86s -> 29116.18s]  to do about like two hours give or take about two hours okay between like 20 minutes and two hours
[29117.14s -> 29134.38s]  one to two hours we're gonna do it we're gonna do it so here's what's gonna happen i'm gonna
[29134.38s -> 29139.90s]  go eat a piece of lettuce i'm just gonna go i need to walk away from it for a minute we're all good
[29139.90s -> 29144.66s]  everything's good i just i'm gonna go eat a piece of pop some i'm gonna eat like two three peanuts

[29152.65s -> 29251.85s]  late for you but see you soon all right got some peanuts it was that smoke monster thing
[29252.49s -> 29272.81s]  that fucked me all up that was like the catalyst for the near meltdown we're supposed show us your
[29272.81s -> 29285.18s]  peanuts they're very boring but if you want to see them again it's just default planter's peanuts
[29285.90s -> 29307.58s]  nothing special peanuts are not nuts what do you mean they're legumes

[29341.85s -> 29356.36s]  it's all good not eating raw peanuts well let's think about like okay it's been like eight
[29356.36s -> 29363.35s]  more than eight hours should should i call it no because realistically speaking look at this map
[29363.99s -> 29368.47s]  well i'm gonna come back and do this for like an hour and 10 minutes like in a few days
[29370.17s -> 29389.19s]  no i'm good to go you gotta go all in sometimes not every time he thinks he's done in two hours

[29444.86s -> 29449.10s]  time since i've had like four streams in a row and like this stream like this where it's more
[29449.10s -> 29456.57s]  than eight to ten hours it's been a while we also stopped a fight about steak that's true
[29466.49s -> 29470.25s]  just don't get stuck in your own traps that's never not going to happen i could have eaten
[29472.82s -> 29487.62s]  i love the protein star brain that's hilarious i mean it's true my diet's been fucked up because

[30336.58s -> 30342.46s]  going on there now i know i just have to see and look where the things were coming from
[30343.18s -> 30350.74s]  and i was able to focus on it very clearly because that's the power of peanuts
[30352.39s -> 30382.36s]  look at i'm already back all right where's this cottage right here no down further creamy or
[30382.36s -> 30387.88s]  crunchy i like creamy peanut butter better than crunchy it's not i love crunchy peanut butter
[30389.24s -> 30396.28s]  but if i had to choose it would be creamy i like it better on sandwiches if you spread uh peanut
[30396.28s -> 30401.08s]  butter and fluff it's an all-time classic one of my favorite sandwiches pretty much ever when i was
[30401.08s -> 30437.91s]  a kid i have a soft spot i have a soft spot for peanuts um a second here damn you guys take a lot
[30437.91s -> 30467.51s]  of hits i'm just keeping the hunting rifle out i mean i'm here how do i get in here
[30475.02s -> 30489.91s]  what the hell have you done i thought he was in front of me

[30497.58s -> 30535.45s]  is there a better way i can get up there here we go gas tank watch out for that thing you got a lot
[30535.45s -> 30551.69s]  of these what okay just me that's me doing that the cottage is surrounded by a barricade
[30551.69s -> 30561.59s]  made out of old furniture and rusty barbed wire probably stolen from some fence that's a lot of
[30561.59s -> 30581.48s]  scrap metal what are you doing to me is it one down here too barricaded i still don't understand
[30584.12s -> 30613.94s]  that's another trap i'm so i'm panicking about these things i don't need to be panicking
[30613.94s -> 30618.74s]  those things are not that big of a deal yes they are yes they are yes they are are they
[30626.23s -> 30635.24s]  i still don't understand what they what what are they doing when my back is turned they

[30710.04s -> 30723.06s]  gas mask she's wearing can't you speak did someone take away your voice two children high behind the
[30723.06s -> 30734.71s]  woman one eye in me scared standing there other one scared enough from around here would recognize

[30754.78s -> 30760.31s]  walking through the woods the trees and plains are simply beautiful here and the bushes bloom
[30760.31s -> 30765.11s]  gorgeously this time of year but don't let the charm of this land deceive you the devil lurks
[30765.11s -> 30769.19s]  the devil lurks between these trees and he gets to you through your mouth and nose
[30769.19s -> 30776.33s]  so can i just make the devil mad the older child's grasp on his mother's hand tightens
[30776.89s -> 30784.52s]  he does not lift his gaze from one of his hunts walls and you're just gonna stand there i know
[30784.52s -> 30789.08s]  you want something you leper demon you're not getting anything from us i don't trust you leper

[30803.82s -> 30808.78s]  no that cannot be the woman stares at the floor her greasy black hair drops down on her mask
[30809.58s -> 30815.66s]  it's impossible stupid child he went out never came back he was on about how his granny will take
[30815.66s -> 30821.74s]  him mushrooming i have no idea where he i told him he cannot go outside i told him that he the

[30852.20s -> 30862.76s]  about three years ago used to lead to our village i walked it to school the road home my road home
[30862.76s -> 30868.73s]  home something exploded in the northern part of the swamp made the ground tremble
[30868.73s -> 30873.54s]  devil knows what it was i see you're curious investigate it if you have a death wish i think
[30873.54s -> 30879.58s]  it happened in the junkyard oh i've been there already lady the youngest child hidden behind the
[30879.58s -> 30885.99s]  woman's back until now finally finds the courage to make a small step towards me one little bear
[30885.99s -> 30893.88s]  ate a little soup then another one came in quiet the woman smacks the boy in the back of the head
[30893.88s -> 30897.16s]  the punches so hard the hood of his rubber cloak lands on his mask's visor
[30898.46s -> 30905.10s]  not now i'm not in front of a stranger it's just like these lunatics who run around the
[30905.10s -> 30909.82s]  woods searching for god knows what there used to be more of them i guess most of them starved to
[30909.82s -> 30914.68s]  death i remember when they appeared not far from here must have been around two years ago around
[30914.68s -> 30920.76s]  two dozen of them they were led by these three weirdos dressed in old rags they set up camp at
[30920.76s -> 30927.32s]  the marsh there between the trees they watched our house stared right into my windows the oddities
[30927.80s -> 30931.88s]  i thought they wanted to kidnap my children or harm them in some way but when the night
[30931.88s -> 30938.47s]  fell i lost sight of them there was no one there in the morning apart from these two here and
[30938.47s -> 30944.31s]  marsenek there's one more boy of mine my precious darling a blessed child the woman rests her hands
[30944.31s -> 30951.19s]  on the oxygen tanks the children standing beside her this love fills our tanks with clean air for
[30951.19s -> 30957.03s]  this we are forever grateful to him for the clean air for the oxygen tanks for these beautiful masks
[30957.03s -> 30963.27s]  and the book in which the devil after just making the devil mad has revealed his true image along

[31535.14s -> 31539.70s]  whispering as if reciting something under his breath the boy cowers and presses his back against

[31548.38s -> 31553.13s]  the boy is terrified slowly he slumps down from the wall to the ground curling into a ball
[31553.13s -> 31560.26s]  the murmur turns into a loud recitation little bear ate a bowl of soup then another bear came

[31586.30s -> 31591.80s]  journey as we pass the remains of the old lady the boy stops reciting i feel his hands tightly
[31591.80s -> 31598.20s]  clutching my coat granny as i cross the cottage's threshold i can hear him sobbing quietly

[37325.69s -> 37330.49s]  under the weight of my hand as i cast my glance on the light brown construction from plywood i
[37330.49s -> 37336.97s]  notice familiar features they are elongated and arched i can smell the fresh sheets in the
[37336.97s -> 37346.65s]  pleasant warmth of the quilt look under the bed i feel a gentle draught coming from the dark gap
[37348.07s -> 37362.90s]  between the bed and the floor reach under the bed my fingertips brush a thin layer of dust
[37362.90s -> 37366.82s]  coldness moisture i'm touching something rough but my arm is too short to catch it

[38014.89s -> 38019.82s]  the man mom was in his sleep he's emaciated and dirty but his face is radiant and calm he
[38019.82s -> 38030.22s]  clutches a rusty object covered with old beads some weapon but what do you got the man is talking
[38030.22s -> 38033.50s]  in his sleep he's the only snippets of sentences single words spoken gently and slowly it's hard
[38033.50s -> 38041.03s]  to find any meaning in them leave without opening his eyes the man clumsily waves his hand at me
[38041.03s -> 38051.40s]  then covers his head with it and freezes give it to me give me that thing leave the man waves his
[38051.40s -> 38055.08s]  hand again this time he grabs my arm without opening his eyes he turns his head towards me

[38068.01s -> 38073.54s]  take her the man clenches his teeth with the fury of a maniac saliva flows from his mouth

[38113.40s -> 38131.54s]  what are you doing that's four people okay that's four i'll take the fuck five six seven
[38132.10s -> 38141.51s]  huge roots blocked away even if i manage to climb them everything is surrounded by a steep slope
[38141.51s -> 38169.80s]  overgrown with thick roots there's no way out oh yeah what are you doing i'm gonna take out the
[38169.80s -> 38178.49s]  trash now step back everybody get out of the way i don't want to add a ninth and tenth person to
[38178.49s -> 38182.97s]  this list once you get past 10 people killed that might be innocent in a video game you're a psycho
[38183.53s -> 38247.10s]  just move that's way more than 10 all right can i get out leave i'm trying to leave
[38257.38s -> 38260.84s]  i can't leave am i out of gas
[38317.70s -> 38407.83s]  it's too many it's okay sprint how do i skip the cutscene that was crazy a great fire consumed
[38407.83s -> 38426.09s]  the woods for a couple days gradually claiming many of its inhabitants you're a sicko that's
[38426.09s -> 38437.69s]  the first thing i saw the fire consumed the last road leading to the heart of the woods
[38438.57s -> 38450.84s]  the doctor who did not wake up even as the flames came closer the doctor made it all the way through
[38451.48s -> 38457.26s]  that's at least one npc that got to live the three outcasts wearing old rags and scrap who
[38457.26s -> 38471.27s]  brief stricken under the enormous completely burnt tree didn't even attempt to run the elephant
[38471.27s -> 38484.44s]  family who did not leave their house at the swamp even as the flame started consuming it the chicken
[38484.44s -> 38497.21s]  lady who set out into the woods in search for her sister and lost the way not everyone perished i
[38497.21s -> 38505.61s]  think i got the bad ending i didn't get the true bad ending heo trek did not live to see the fire
[38505.61s -> 38510.41s]  before the flames appeared he rose above the treetops and his rocket made up scrap as he looked
[38510.41s -> 38514.97s]  through the small spaceship window he smiled for the last time the milky ways and stars looked so
[38514.97s -> 38520.25s]  beautiful even now and moving away at a huge speed slide he was exploded on the ground
[38520.25s -> 38543.30s]  incomprehensible whispers and calls ceased forever they saw incoming helicopters above the destroyed
[38543.30s -> 38606.15s]  land wolf snout remains unknown there it is that was a good game first impressions uh first
[38606.15s -> 38618.28s]  impressions of the game this is good i think um my first impressions once i figure out the
[38618.28s -> 38624.73s]  inventory management i think i'll start to give a better idea because the stacks are weird so
[38624.73s -> 38628.17s]  some things don't stack about when i figure that out i've only had like three or four items in my
[38628.17s -> 38641.51s]  inventory so far so i'm sure it'll get easier last impressions this was a solid game i feel like um
[38643.48s -> 38650.95s]  at least for me chapter two that this last like hour was great but there was like a little tiny
[38650.95s -> 38669.40s]  part of chapter two that i just i it was killing me but sometimes it needs some peanuts and we're
[38669.40s -> 38680.17s]  good i wonder how much of that portion that like 20 minute portion of chapter two that i was getting
[38680.17s -> 38684.57s]  straight on and i was getting frustrated i wonder if it's because i would have like low protein brain
[38686.82s -> 38696.68s]  it's probably it's probably pretty accurate no that was good that was really good i'm glad
[38696.68s -> 38708.17s]  i got to finish the whole thing on stream thanks for watching i will see you guys again
[38709.94s -> 38717.00s]  on uh let's see i have a couple things oh by the way i want to talk about the i want to talk about
[38717.00s -> 38723.08s]  the just really quick before you leave but you can leave if you want but uh halloween there's
[38723.08s -> 38729.08s]  going to be a special stream uh whether it's the 28th 29th 30th 31st i'm not sure yet we have to
[38729.08s -> 38734.92s]  lock it in there's going to be a secret slime channel in the discord and what's going to
[38734.92s -> 38741.32s]  happen here is all you really need to know is on 31st you're going to be able to slime me
[38742.04s -> 38747.72s]  or maybe you won't maybe you will but you're going to have a channel in the discord to come
[38747.80s -> 38755.24s]  up with actions for me that you think i'm going to do without me knowing so oh scratch your nose
[38756.04s -> 38762.78s]  if i do that and it's part of the first round like probably about 10 rounds so probably well
[38762.78s -> 38773.61s]  it's hard for me to speak i just have to search for words up here but uh you guys have to come
[38773.61s -> 38781.48s]  up with things that you think that i do but that i will do on camera to dump a bucket of slime on
[38781.48s -> 38787.66s]  my head and also at the same time you are also going to be up against some bullshit here too
[38787.66s -> 38795.02s]  because i'm going to come up with shit that you can't do and if you say it in the chat you're out
[38795.02s -> 38804.65s]  for the rest of the game it's happening on halloween those of you that want a good um
[38804.65s -> 38812.58s]  indicator of exactly what this is go watch an episode just even one snippet of figure it out
[38812.58s -> 38821.70s]  from nickelodeon back in the 90s that secret slime action is kind of what this is inspired by so
[38821.70s -> 38829.93s]  oh and i am i am going to win everybody in chat is worth one point i start with like 10 000 points
[38829.93s -> 38834.25s]  every time i get slimed i get reduced by about 500 to 1000 points we're not trying to get those
[38834.25s -> 38842.20s]  numbers correct every time somebody gets snapped deleted from chat you guys lose a point so 100
[38842.20s -> 38845.16s]  people say the thing that they're not supposed to saying at the end of the round found out though
[38845.16s -> 38851.14s]  that you said it that's minus 100 points each person's worth one how many buckets of slime is
[38851.14s -> 38858.94s]  it gonna be gonna make we're gonna make like a a big batch of just random easy slime i want to i
[38858.94s -> 38865.10s]  want to make like a slime that's not like dog shit for the environment so i'm gonna look into that
[38865.10s -> 38869.99s]  try to find out like a good one that's not gonna be a problem because i know that a lot of slimes
[38869.99s -> 38881.40s]  are just like absolute poison right so i'll figure it out that's the one thing i when i looked up
[38881.40s -> 38888.66s]  stuff about slime oh you're making slime slime stuff it's this stuff is like styrofoam 5.0 so
[38888.66s -> 38894.50s]  i don't really want to make just like that's kind of i'd rather try to do something a little more
[38895.06s -> 38902.97s]  eco-friendly but uh that's what's gonna happen we'll talk about it some more obviously when i'm
[38902.97s -> 38910.42s]  back and had some sleep i will see you guys on tuesday so uh one two three i'll see you tuesday
[38910.42s -> 38919.96s]  we've beaten dark wood there are like two or three scary games that some of them aren't even scary
[38919.96s -> 38925.18s]  but they're gonna be here for halloween look under your bed oh i'm gonna make sure that there's no
[38925.82s -> 38932.57s]  pulsating twigs under my bed i'll make sure but that was dark wood and that was my stream
[38932.57s -> 38937.69s]  thanks this is a long one 11 hours almost thanks everybody for staying if you just i mean there's
[38937.69s -> 38944.63s]  still a lot of people there at the very end thanks i put it up with my bullshit you know the last
[38944.63s -> 38955.69s]  vegan you know what i'm saying and i will see you guys holy shit does it work does it actually work
[38955.69s -> 38975.30s]  maybe it does oh my how much did why is there a countdown this thing is so
[38975.30s -> 38975.86s]  fucked up
[38979.51s -> 38985.05s]  has this been counting down since yesterday this has been running a sub train in the back
[38985.05s -> 38990.38s]  route for the whole stream and hadn't even been on that's so funny just let it go i'm just gonna
[38990.38s -> 38997.40s]  leave it there i'm gonna i'm going to spend these next few days especially probably tomorrow i'm
[38997.40s -> 39006.36s]  gonna figure this shit out and make sure it works but uh let me see let me see how many bits we have
[39006.36s -> 39027.13s]  here here comes a time gifter if someone doesn't gift a sub in the next 90 seconds this channel is
[39027.13s -> 39037.74s]  gonna get deleted i don't know if that's how it works uh we can do the bits i'm gonna really just
[39037.74s -> 39043.93s]  kind of go through them quickly though because it is very very very late thank you to marvosh
[39043.93s -> 39050.62s]  magali for the 250 they showed the halloween map with j elbertson's thing that's so awesome by the
[39050.62s -> 39072.76s]  way i'm absolutely fucking floored that i have a banner on a tf2 map that's awesome oh i'm stupid
[39072.76s -> 39086.22s]  i need to close this and put on the music there we go but uh yeah if if you weren't here earlier
[39087.26s -> 39096.36s]  in the new tf2 halloween map there's a reference to the carnival stream that's crazy it's really
[39096.36s -> 39103.45s]  cool i'm probably gonna go check it out and see and just take a look at it yeah holy shit
[39104.33s -> 39112.52s]  somebody did it somebody subscribed wait did it reset oh that's what that means right
[39114.84s -> 39119.32s]  hey it's time for slime thanks for the 300 bits our username will finally be relevant when this
[39119.32s -> 39125.64s]  halloween stream comes yeah it's gonna be great also thanks for your five community subs as well
[39126.84s -> 39136.14s]  uh cyrus dexter thanks for the 265 appreciate it thank you family kidneys for the 500 bits
[39136.14s -> 39151.26s]  they say free hong kong we're in a pretty terminalistic world at the moment but yeah
[39151.26s -> 39164.41s]  it's it's really odd to see just at least in my opinion when when shit like this is going down
[39165.05s -> 39183.16s]  germans can get banned unless it's gonna fire you my senator was talking about it yeah no this this
[39183.16s -> 39192.20s]  shit is fucking really coming up to a head here and hopefully hopefully this gets resolved in the
[39192.20s -> 39200.54s]  good way you know obviously i'm a proponent of democracy very much so i mean i live in the
[39200.54s -> 39223.98s]  united states i live in hong kong and it's very sad that this is happening yeah but the thing is
[39223.98s -> 39233.66s]  when when i'll give you my just short 30 second blurb of this whole thing i really don't know why
[39234.38s -> 39243.18s]  blizzard would take prize money from someone i've like that's just it just seems ridiculous
[39249.50s -> 39254.06s]  like i was talking i forget who was talking about this but it's like okay if you ban somebody from
[39254.06s -> 39259.03s]  a tournament but they win the tournament you know what i mean like you you didn't ban them from the
[39259.03s -> 39263.03s]  tournament you're like just banned them from winning you banned them from winning the tournament
[39267.43s -> 39272.47s]  it's like oh hey i i've got i won some money on this tournament you're banned from that
[39272.47s -> 39280.70s]  tournament well i already is in the tournament well you just shit you're banned from it though
[39280.70s -> 39285.35s]  that's like it's like getting arrested it's like a it's like a police officer asking you
[39285.35s -> 39291.27s]  son have you ever smoked marijuana before in your life it's like yeah you're under arrest
[39293.91s -> 39301.10s]  did you smoke marijuana yesterday yeah you have any on you right now no you're under arrest
[39301.66s -> 39313.11s]  what but also i'm also of the opinion that if let's say if somebody is like a fan of hearthstone
[39313.11s -> 39322.12s]  let's say somebody loves hearthstone there are way more people in blizzard than just the top
[39322.12s -> 39331.62s]  five people that make decisions and it's a problem at the top not a problem with the people that care
[39331.62s -> 39347.53s]  about those games so anytime somebody says well you stop supporting blizzard stop supporting
[39347.53s -> 39353.30s]  hearthstone stop supporting warcraft there are people that have put their whole lives into those
[39353.30s -> 39362.41s]  games dedicated their whole lives people that have built those worlds you know and they probably have
[39362.41s -> 39374.70s]  the same feelings that a lot of people do they still get paid for that you're not hurting them
[39375.43s -> 39380.62s]  no i know but but still you just you got to remember that there's this there's a lot of
[39380.62s -> 39391.06s]  people it's it's not just it's not just you that feel this way and there is an issue with
[39392.50s -> 39400.09s]  essentially people running companies that decide everything for everybody else kind of
[39400.81s -> 39408.95s]  which i mean that that's what happens when you run a company even if it means
[39410.62s -> 39420.01s]  they're going to do something that's not seen as right or it's wrong or it's sensitive but sometimes
[39420.01s -> 39437.94s]  the bottom line is what matters to a lot of these companies so it's a weird position that was a
[39437.94s -> 39450.57s]  long 30 seconds it's like a full five minutes but i do i do want to give i mean obviously
[39454.14s -> 39457.26s]  i'll tell you what's going to be blizzcon is going to be very interesting
[39457.98s -> 39463.08s]  because it's almost like they've i don't know what the fuck they're going to do
[39463.72s -> 39476.87s]  what are they going to be like hey everybody all right hey here's uh here's diablo four
[39478.97s -> 39493.43s]  right isn't that great that's great right that's good shit isn't it right most people still gonna
[39493.43s -> 39501.64s]  go yeah but think about that though right like imagine that's in like two or three weeks imagine
[39501.64s -> 39511.40s]  you already booked your hotel you booked your flight like it's okay to still enjoy things
[39515.59s -> 39520.39s]  but i severely disagree with all the stuff that the people at the top have decided to do
[39521.11s -> 39540.98s]  severely completely but we'll see i don't know maybe something happened here maybe
[39542.02s -> 39548.87s]  maybe like the head can get pulled out of the ass and maybe we'll see some it's actually something
[39548.87s -> 39570.30s]  good come from this i don't know did they put a statement out today i'll have to read it after
[39570.94s -> 39588.34s]  but yeah pull heads from ass i really like this music it is very good it was it was it was a
[39588.34s -> 39599.62s]  garbage statement it was a non-answer it was it was it was just like a corporate copy paste like
[39599.62s -> 39629.83s]  alexa wrote it yeah that's unfortunate we'll see what happens we'll move on from that though
[39629.83s -> 39640.89s]  germa please say something extremely controversial i don't i don't think anything i think i think most
[39640.89s -> 39649.50s]  of the things i said it would but a lot of people think i'm not a very complicated person guys you
[39649.50s -> 39656.31s]  know i'm pretty um i kind of see things the way that they are and that's kind of the way that it
[39656.31s -> 39678.52s]  is and that's it he's a simple streamer but he has bad taste in ice cream and steak oh i always
[39678.52s -> 39685.24s]  see blizzard ads when i load up your stream well that's i mean that's a twitch thing though
[39689.26s -> 39692.78s]  i mean i make i make wow references all the time but you have to remember i played
[39694.60s -> 39700.73s]  i don't play blizzard games anymore i don't the last time i opened up overwatch i think was like
[39700.73s -> 39708.97s]  two years ago i downloaded wow classic when it first came out got to like level seven and realized
[39708.97s -> 39719.66s]  holy shit i don't want to do this again it's like wow this is this is i remember what this was like
[39719.74s -> 39732.92s]  i still thought it was interesting though i still thought it was cool
[39734.36s -> 39746.42s]  but i i kind of just don't have the time to do it anymore to do that but yeah i i'm not really
[39746.42s -> 39759.72s]  i don't really have a connection to blizzard at all but you said you play hearthstone every
[39759.72s -> 39765.08s]  night on your ipad maybe a while ago maybe maybe one of the adventures came out like
[39766.07s -> 39772.38s]  three four five months ago i did i played hearthstone yeah like a few months ago yeah
[39773.26s -> 39784.66s]  i don't not anymore and before that not for a while we aren't 16 anymore feels
[39784.66s -> 39793.18s]  fucked man what but i'll uh i'll move on from the kind of controversy that's going on in the
[39793.18s -> 39805.24s]  gaming world we'll move on because it is getting late he won't say nevada what are you talking
[39805.24s -> 39814.95s]  about why wouldn't i say even that but i feel hopefully i've tried to articulate some of the
[39814.95s -> 39826.60s]  things that i think hopefully i did i have been streaming for 11 hours so but here we go sad
[39826.60s -> 39834.68s]  vega thanks for the 250 you know what that full moon thing how do you explain every other day
[39834.68s -> 39851.10s]  of the month i'll agree with you you've been extra weird today i have not been extra weird today
[39856.57s -> 39869.38s]  hey cream corn thanks the five community subs i wasn't extra weird today i was just normal weird
[39869.38s -> 39885.00s]  i was what do you mean because i did the cookie crisp you killed an old man and laughed about it
[39885.00s -> 39889.56s]  for 20 minutes no that wasn't what why i was laughing at i was laughing at everybody's
[39889.56s -> 39900.58s]  extremely quick reaction to it no you have to understand i saw like a bunch of random messages
[39900.58s -> 39921.30s]  that were just pushing me over the edge oh god that was fucking ridiculous i just didn't understand
[39921.30s -> 39925.74s]  the consequences of my actions everybody knew the consequences
[39930.57s -> 39945.48s]  he's still everybody hey he was crawling at the end of the movie you saw him uh this community

[40664.82s -> 40675.34s]  somebody says oh there was help yeah but i mean i i was all right playing a scary horror jumpy
[40675.34s -> 40684.15s]  game for that takes a lot of non-hand holding for like nine ten hours my normal gaming sessions
[40684.15s -> 40691.27s]  even when i'm not on stream even before i was streaming were like four or five hours tops so

[40709.70s -> 40714.34s]  channel grows how do you think you will handle a regular everyday chat of 10 000 or 20 000 people
[40716.46s -> 40734.74s]  i do not think that will happen i mean i've had 10 000 and close to 20 000 before but not every day
[40735.30s -> 40746.25s]  i'm not sure that'll happen the amount of time it took we'll think about it right it just go by
[40747.72s -> 40754.73s]  it's taken a long time to get here that i've been you doing youtube and streaming for almost 10
[40754.73s -> 40765.18s]  years and there are a shitload of people that are even here now so i don't know i i can't predict
[40765.18s -> 40771.50s]  that i'm gonna have 20 000 concurrent viewers on this stream i mean you're talking about like the
[40771.50s -> 40790.23s]  top like 20 channels on twitch top 10 i don't know i the doors are open but i'm whatever happens i'm
[40790.23s -> 40802.06s]  comfortable whatever happens happens but how would i handle something like that which is will you know
[40802.06s -> 40809.62s]  you change a few rules you make it a little different and not try not to change anything
[40810.49s -> 40819.30s]  really that much i mean going from 800 to 1000 viewers nothing really changed that much in
[40819.30s -> 40825.38s]  regards to how i approached a stream 1000 to 2000 to 3000 three to four four to five five to six
[40827.32s -> 40834.98s]  i just i approached my approach is the same if i have 10 000 viewers or a thousand
[40836.02s -> 40855.18s]  i don't really change how i do anything but i appreciate the 250 thank you we also had uh
