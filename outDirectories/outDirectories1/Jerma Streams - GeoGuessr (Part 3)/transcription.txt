[2.17s -> 28.07s]  Silence. Silence. The end. Okay. Explore the world. Let me get this on for you guys. We're just
[28.07s -> 43.83s]  gonna chill. I gotta change this to... what do I change this to? Winding down for a little bit
[43.83s -> 69.82s]  and we'll... is GeoGuessy even on here? It is. GeoGuessy. Okay, that should be updated, I think.
[79.13s -> 91.27s]  Uh, no, I need to... no, I need to capture the window. Not the browser. Add window. There we go.
[96.73s -> 119.72s]  Not that one. Which one is it? Why does somebody process this for this? What the hell? This is
[119.72s -> 128.82s]  a weird... um, it's gonna have to open some other window. For some strange reason it doesn't want to
[128.82s -> 157.69s]  work. Okay, uh, let's try it again. Colon cam. Incoming colon cam. There it is. All right,
[157.69s -> 172.79s]  that took a long enough. All right, I see things. I see things. Let's try not to get
[172.79s -> 199.58s]  the ads in there though. There. We could do without the ever-changing ad. Okay. And then
[199.58s -> 218.01s]  let me get my camera on. That camera's way too big. Is this delayed? Shouldn't be. Hey guys,
[218.01s -> 232.62s]  how are you? Move this... I gotta move the camera to over here. Hold on. Sorry, I'm moving
[232.62s -> 244.25s]  you around a lot. Let me see how that looks. How does that look? Well, that changed quickly.
[244.25s -> 271.43s]  Over here, right? Like this? Crazy eyes. Not in frame. I am now. And then we're gonna flip me.
[271.43s -> 286.44s]  Watch this. Ready? Take a look. Greasy hair. It's not greasy. It's just slippery. Okay. Geo
[286.44s -> 292.07s]  guesser. Are you ready to play? Look, I played Mr. Mosquito for like fucking two hours. Of
[292.07s -> 303.91s]  course I'm gonna be sweating. All right, we can go. Thank you for your patience. Uh,
[303.91s -> 314.74s]  let's find out where we are in the world. All right, so we got, uh, walking... walking
[314.74s -> 325.10s]  person. Car? What's a car say? Let's just walk down the road. Somebody said Minecraft birch tree.
[325.66s -> 331.67s]  Look out for the car. I'm in a car. This is a... What is the kind of road is this? This is
[331.67s -> 343.35s]  small road. This is not in America. Is this two lanes or is this... You tell me a car comes
[343.35s -> 354.25s]  down here? No, we're on the right side of the road. Well, we'll find out. If a car
[354.25s -> 356.73s]  comes the other way, then we're not in America, but we're definitely not in America
[356.73s -> 373.88s]  anyways. What does the sign say? Don't walk or crosswalk? No, this is definitely not
[373.88s -> 396.14s]  America. The road's too narrow, but hold on a second here. Maybe it is. This is... this is...
[396.14s -> 401.58s]  I think this might actually be somewhere in North America. That's not a Euro truck.
[403.05s -> 412.44s]  That's not... that's not a Euro truck. This is America. This is America or somewhere in North
[412.44s -> 419.18s]  America. We're on the right side of the road. Nobody else does that. We're one of the
[419.18s -> 445.77s]  places... only places on earth that does this. Keep going. Uh, what is this person doing?
[445.77s -> 456.62s]  This is in... this is Russia. Passing? Who are they passing? Who are you passing? They were
[456.62s -> 465.59s]  passing the Google truck? I was gonna laugh if there was like a finger out the window.
[465.59s -> 478.20s]  This couldn't handle it. You had to get around the Google truck. All right, so we're
[478.20s -> 491.46s]  somewhere in Russia, Ukraine. The aspect ratio is too stretched. Why? Because it's like
[491.46s -> 504.94s]  squished. All right, hold on. Let me fix this. Why is this still on? Is that better?
[507.91s -> 510.31s]  I don't want to... okay, the reason why I don't have the whole thing out here is
[510.31s -> 514.14s]  because I don't want you to see this. I don't want you to see like the... all the ads that
[514.14s -> 537.78s]  I have to get. That's good. That's fine. Yeah, that's fine. That's fine. Look, ready?
[537.78s -> 553.00s]  Now you don't even know. You can't even tell. This looks like we're watching a movie.
[553.00s -> 559.43s]  All right, so somewhere in Russia. Definitely not a cold part of Russia. Everybody's bad.
[560.39s -> 563.11s]  People in Russia, man, you don't want to be behind the Google truck or in front of
[563.11s -> 576.09s]  whatever. Let me see here. Uh, let's just say... because, uh, I'm gonna say
[576.89s -> 587.66s]  a lot of green down here. It's definitely not up here. Let me see if I can get a sign,
[587.66s -> 595.77s]  although I can't read. So how am I gonna do that? It seems like outside of some... a very major
[595.77s -> 611.70s]  city somehow. There's a lot of, uh, development over there. I'm gonna just say here. Challenge
[611.70s -> 617.74s]  your friends. How the... how the economic machine works. I don't remember getting ads.
[618.30s -> 636.30s]  That wasn't that bad. I don't remember getting these ads. 3,000 kilometers. That's pretty...
[636.30s -> 650.63s]  that's not bad. Considering how big Russia is. All right, next round. Why are the outsides of
[650.63s -> 659.94s]  the windows blurred but not the part of the window that matters? The window part. I don't
[659.94s -> 666.89s]  know what you're trying to blur here. All right, let's take a look. Let's go down here. Uh,
[667.77s -> 685.69s]  dirt road. Green, white house with a shed. Okay, let's get off the dirt road so I can see.
[686.25s -> 699.62s]  This looks like a little European town. Oh, another... look, a Euro truck, right?
[700.26s -> 717.46s]  Is it prison? What does that say? I can't read that. I could get onto a highway or something this
[717.46s -> 728.70s]  way. All right, where we go? Okay, hold on. Kapampin. No, this is also... this is Russia.
[728.70s -> 753.85s]  This is also Russia. Is it? Is this Russia? Russia's always so hard because Russia's so
[753.85s -> 784.78s]  huge. Russia is like 30% of the whole earth. Let's go down here, right? What is that? Oh,
[784.78s -> 791.21s]  I thought that was an animal. What are you... what are they doing to this house?
[791.77s -> 813.10s]  Is it... is it brick? Bricklaying. Interesting. Ireland? No, this is not Ireland. This is Russia.
[813.10s -> 828.98s]  I can't read that. There's nothing... I don't think there's anything there. I can't...
[830.10s -> 845.42s]  there's no words there. I don't think this is like a major city. Maybe this...
[845.42s -> 864.44s]  I'm like stuck on the dirt roads. This is... I don't know. Let's take a guess. White
[864.44s -> 880.23s]  intersection. Uh, no major city. It's gotta be like a town name or like a town center.
[880.23s -> 908.78s]  Okay, hold on. What's this? Bank. That's a bank? Bank of... Ben? Bank of Russia. I don't
[908.78s -> 933.32s]  think it's Bank of Russia. What about down here? Hold on. The thing... the thing about Russian,
[933.32s -> 937.16s]  maybe it's just because of the alphabet, right? We use the... we use the same alphabet,
[937.16s -> 950.31s]  but I feel like I'm looking at words in a dream. You know what I mean? Like,
[950.31s -> 953.75s]  I feel like I'm just... it's so upside down and backwards in my brain.
[954.55s -> 962.63s]  Like, I feel... when I'm in a dream, I feel like this is what the letters look like in my
[962.63s -> 973.43s]  brain. Next time you have a dream, wake up. Next time you have a dream, look at... open up a book.
[973.99s -> 985.70s]  You'll see. All right, I'm going for it. It's the same place I guessed last time.
[986.90s -> 996.31s]  That's like the same exact spot. It was the same... it was the same spot. It was just over
[996.31s -> 1002.65s]  here. No, I didn't... what am I clicking on? Why did it just load up an ad? It just like
[1002.65s -> 1020.84s]  forced me into an ad. All right, here we go. Turn on your ad block. Does this site open
[1020.84s -> 1024.90s]  with an ad block? Is it Russia again? I don't know about that. This isn't... this might
[1024.90s -> 1043.70s]  not be Russia. This looks American. Yeah. This is... this is definitely American.
[1045.14s -> 1052.39s]  Somewhere in the Midwest. Give me a street sign. Give me a name. Give me a name. Anything.
[1052.39s -> 1062.14s]  Stop ahead. We're in America. Only in America will it warn you to make sure you understand
[1062.14s -> 1069.30s]  that you need to stop at a stop sign. Only in America is that possible. There's a stop sign
[1069.30s -> 1085.32s]  before the stop sign. Divided highway, okay. That's a warning stop sign. American town in
[1085.32s -> 1102.42s]  Russia. Oh, we've got Westby. That could be anything, though. Westby. But no, wait. Population
[1103.38s -> 1117.48s]  2,200 people. This is the middle of nowhere somewhere in the Midwest. Can we get a state,
[1117.48s -> 1122.50s]  though? Come on, let's go. Old town, motel, restaurant. There you go. You've got
[1122.50s -> 1136.47s]  Kansas's finest. Come on, right? Can't see. No. Galaxy? What about this side? Oh, hold on.
[1138.31s -> 1151.67s]  Madison? Wisconsin. Is this Wisconsin? Madison, Wisconsin. So if Madison's 104 miles that way,
[1154.10s -> 1173.72s]  where's Madison? Where is Madison, Wisconsin? Madison. It's 100 miles off of Madison. Which
[1173.72s -> 1185.80s]  way are we facing right now? This is important. That's my compass. So this is south. So we're
[1185.80s -> 1200.01s]  going red means it's pointing, right? So this is south. This is like southeast. Wait, what do
[1200.01s -> 1221.91s]  you mean? The red is the indicator, right? Or is white the indicator? Red is north. Why would
[1222.71s -> 1243.54s]  north, north up here? North is up. So this is north. This is northwest. So this is 104
[1243.54s -> 1256.50s]  miles northwest of Madison. I don't use fucking compasses. Okay. Let's find Westby. So we have
[1256.50s -> 1270.22s]  104 miles northwest. Westby. How much 104 miles? It's fucking up here, isn't it? Westby. Westby.
[1271.58s -> 1291.46s]  Up here somewhere further. Westby. What road is this? If it's 104 miles on this road.
[1293.69s -> 1320.33s]  What road? 14, 12. This might be 12. 18, 14. I'm gonna say like right up here. Warrens,
[1320.89s -> 1348.78s]  Thomas, Sparta, Whitehall, Melrose. It's like up here. Did I miss it? Wilton, Jefferson,
[1348.78s -> 1375.42s]  Caston, Ontario. 5,000 points. Didn't get it by the street. I'm not looking to get it perfect.
[1375.42s -> 1385.14s]  Did you enjoy this location? I've never been there. All right. That was good. That was a good
[1385.14s -> 1396.92s]  run. Hoots. Health Mart Pharmacy. Hoots. Still in America, I think. Let's find a city or town
[1396.92s -> 1421.62s]  center or something. Wilenskis. Wisconsin. No. Wilenskis Brothers. Saba. What is it? Head Start?
[1422.18s -> 1438.90s]  Saba. San Saba. What's? Wait. No, no, no, no. Hold on. What's down here? Bella?
[1439.54s -> 1447.29s]  Oh, apparently not. Why would they like blur that out but then not blur it out?
[1448.01s -> 1463.02s]  Okay. So this is obviously somewhere in America. Let's go up here. I'm not ready to take a
[1463.02s -> 1475.66s]  guess. Decker. Decker Street. Recreation Club. The Busy Bee. Smart. This is all boarded up.
[1475.66s -> 1491.78s]  Recreation Club. Where? Okay. We're in Menard. Where is Menard? Looks like this is a school
[1491.78s -> 1499.56s]  down here. Maybe they'll get a town name. Is it a pool? It's out here. Hold on. Wait, wait,
[1499.56s -> 1517.50s]  wait. Menard Manor. Hotel in Menard Manor. Let me go down here. Right. School. We love
[1517.50s -> 1547.22s]  our children. Drive slow. Is it a church or a temple or? Let's go over here. Can I
[1547.22s -> 1552.18s]  can't go down there? All right. What about the school? Wait. Hold on. The Menard News.
[1552.18s -> 1556.90s]  A lot of these places love to have the name of where you are in the title of their.
[1556.90s -> 1587.54s]  What's this? Okay. Weirdly enough. All right. The Menard Church of Christ. That's four
[1587.54s -> 1605.80s]  churches. That was one, two, three, four. The elementary school. I think we've gone off
[1605.80s -> 1637.75s]  there. Whoa. That's what made me puke. I got to get back to the businesses.
[1641.43s -> 1648.04s]  It's definitely somewhere in down south. Has to be. I went way too far away.
[1648.04s -> 1694.98s]  I got to go back. Bowie is okay. Back over here. I'm gonna go all the way back. Menard
[1694.98s -> 1707.26s]  News. I feel like I can get this one. Jacket's Rule. These places don't even have a
[1707.26s -> 1753.96s]  thing on them. Wait. First United Methodist Church. School of. What about back on the
[1753.96s -> 1785.98s]  main road? Ah. What we got? John. Eden. Eden. The land of Eden. Yeah. It's Texas.
[1785.98s -> 1792.20s]  Okay. Menard, Texas. Is that on the map where it is? Look at right there. Hold on.
[1792.20s -> 1798.73s]  Look at the little blip that's right there on the map. You see that? So like right here.
[1798.73s -> 1828.23s]  So that's here. Not very many towns here. Menard. Menard. Anybody see it? It's like
[1828.23s -> 1852.33s]  right here. Fucking told you the blip was going to help us here. All right. So hold
[1852.41s -> 1861.35s]  on a minute here. Let's get this 100% accurate. Menard Manor. Right here. I'm
[1861.35s -> 1873.22s]  gonna go stand at Menard Manor. And I'm gonna get 5,000 points. This is 100%. I'm
[1873.22s -> 1885.37s]  literally standing out the front door of Menard Manor. We're here. We made it. Wait. It's
[1885.37s -> 1894.26s]  where you started. It's based on where you spawned. I don't remember even where I spawned.
[1894.26s -> 1898.55s]  Starting location? That was up here and to the left, right? So if we're looking at
[1898.55s -> 1915.98s]  Menard Manor, we go to the left. Now we're on 2092. Press the flag. Okay. All right.
[1915.98s -> 1922.20s]  All right. Okay. And now I had it right. There's Menard Manor. We're like right here.
[1922.20s -> 1935.42s]  First State Bank. It's like right here. Ranch House Meat Company. Hoots. First State Bank.
[1935.42s -> 1964.81s]  Chamber of Commerce. It's right there. It was like 10 feet. 5,000 points. That was a good
[1964.81s -> 1973.11s]  one. That was two good ones back to back. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Commerce.
[1973.75s -> 1988.44s]  That would be a real boring fucking movie. All right. Another sign. It said Menard. That would
[1988.44s -> 1994.20s]  be if it was... I hate being out in the middle of nowhere because you almost just have
[1994.20s -> 2002.52s]  to go in a straight line till you get to a junction of civilization. There are no houses
[2002.52s -> 2009.64s]  out here. There's nothing even out here. Look. One guy lives out here. One guy lives out here.
[2009.64s -> 2026.58s]  You know what I think is really weird about something like GeoGuessr is the amount of
[2026.58s -> 2030.10s]  probably the hundreds of thousands if not millions of people that have played this game.
[2032.89s -> 2036.33s]  Millions of clicks and the millions of refreshing and new locations.
[2036.97s -> 2045.82s]  How many times has somebody walked by your house? How many people have looked in your
[2045.82s -> 2060.55s]  window? That's weird. You were in my hometown last time you played. See that's
[2061.43s -> 2072.26s]  that's crazy. Wait what what's going on? What happened in chat?
[2079.56s -> 2088.47s]  I was in your house the last time I played. What is it? Creepy pasta? I don't understand.
[2088.47s -> 2107.40s]  Somebody trying to put in creepy pastas? People are posting creepy
[2107.40s -> 2123.99s]  ASCII art. It's a meme thing. Do that in your own house. Hey do that in your own house.
[2124.55s -> 2164.98s]  I am in my house. All right what we got here? TWP road San Do San Dio. Oh my god. What is over
[2164.98s -> 2204.54s]  here? What is stored in there? What is over there? It's it's corn. Just like hurts my eyes.
[2204.54s -> 2209.19s]  I don't like the resolution in this city. Whatever it is. I got the bad graphics settings
[2209.19s -> 2227.72s]  in this city. What's that? Something up here. I can't even go this far. Why does it end
[2227.72s -> 2243.00s]  here? Was the google truck afraid to go down here? All right I that was weird. End of the world.
[2243.00s -> 2248.10s]  We're gonna get we're gonna get to the end. We're gonna get to go look over and see the
[2248.10s -> 2276.47s]  space. That's the end of the earth. You're gonna go you're gonna go like whoa whoa. I have
[2276.47s -> 2297.10s]  no idea what the hell I am. The earth is shaped like a velociraptor. I just the thing
[2297.10s -> 2303.50s]  I don't understand is if the earth is 70% water why doesn't it just fall out and go
[2303.50s -> 2308.22s]  into space? When you pour a glass of water it goes straight down and you spills all over
[2308.22s -> 2315.26s]  the place. So if we're 70% water and we're you know like why is the water not just out in space?
[2340.09s -> 2349.43s]  Earth's mass holds the water here with gravity. I don't know about that. Gravity is something
[2349.43s -> 2353.91s]  I put on my potatoes and you're telling me that's yeah you also put that delicious tastiest
[2353.91s -> 2379.74s]  thing on that's what's keeping us together. Okay. Got some scientists here. Are you
[2379.74s -> 2392.52s]  fucking weirdo still doing ASCII art here? Don't make me bring out the mallet. I'll
[2392.52s -> 2415.91s]  bring out the hammer. I don't know who the fuck I am. Sub mode? Uh oh. He's about to put it in
[2415.91s -> 2432.25s]  sub mode. Maybe if you're good I won't have to do it. Subs are doing it too. I am okay with
[2433.56s -> 2437.80s]  if you're a sub that doesn't mean that you get to break rules and spam and
[2438.52s -> 2442.84s]  just because you're a subscriber you still got to follow the rules. They're down there
[2442.84s -> 2451.18s]  in the description. Just because somebody gave them a lot of money. What? Yeah they did.
[2451.18s -> 2458.76s]  Holy shit. Frodeon Weapon thanks for the 50 bucks. 50 dollars from Frodeon Weapon. 5,000 bits.
[2460.06s -> 2466.87s]  Gravy is what keeps us together. I love the chill parts of these streams. Yeah. Thank you for the
[2466.87s -> 2473.08s]  50 fucking dollars man. 5,000 bits. It's a lot. Um we've had a couple of just kind of chill
[2473.08s -> 2478.86s]  hangout streams recently. Sometimes you do you got to just slow it down right?
[2488.97s -> 2504.15s]  All right it might be time to turn on sub only mode. You know. Now you've done it.
[2507.10s -> 2518.60s]  Sorry I mean we got to control it somehow. I mean all right everyone slow down ever calm down.
[2524.86s -> 2527.90s]  All right I need to find out where I am. What have they got in there?
[2532.47s -> 2555.21s]  Wrestling? Chief Wrestling? Chief Wrestling? Chief Westins? Westins? Juno Upsetto just gave
[2555.21s -> 2569.05s]  five community subs. Thank you Juno Upsetto for the five community subs. That's a lot of subs.
[2569.05s -> 2575.62s]  Thank you. All right we just. Russia is like impossible. Russia is hard mode. It is.
[2576.18s -> 2593.22s]  It seriously is. Look at these. Bang. Bang. Bang. Where are you in Russia? Who has any idea?
[2593.22s -> 2608.10s]  Uh let's do it again. New map. New zone. Now where is this? I don't think this is Russia.
[2608.10s -> 2621.66s]  Why is there just a car here? Is this car just abandoned? Why is there a car just pulled over?
[2621.66s -> 2629.50s]  Are there people? Five more community subs from Lorag. Lorag98 thanks for the five subs.

[2997.98s -> 3013.58s]  everyone knew they were spamming Momo in the chat that time. I can't even go this way. This place
[3013.58s -> 3037.69s]  is off limits. Why is that off limits? A private road. How do you even fit a car down here?
[3037.69s -> 3044.89s]  Sorry Jeremiah I can't let this go. Destinos means destinations is not a currency.

[3287.99s -> 3308.01s]  here down into my spine. I just I just pogged myself to death. Okay that was pretty good though.

[3321.98s -> 3341.78s]  streamer. Yeah I'm morphing. 33 years old. I know. I know. Trust me. I ask and answer
[3341.78s -> 3353.14s]  that same question every day. I know. But here's the thing. Sooner or later I'm gonna
[3353.14s -> 3359.50s]  have to start dressing. I can't wear like a Captain America t-shirt in like five years. Can I?
[3360.71s -> 3375.51s]  If I'm 40 do I have to like wear like vests and jeans? I have to wear like slacks with a button
[3375.51s -> 3384.46s]  up shirt. I don't want to do that. What am I? What am I? My dad or something? What am I? Dad?
[3385.42s -> 3402.71s]  There's a lake there. There's a very long. There's a very long lake that water runs
[3402.71s -> 3416.60s]  forward in. Long forward running lake. You guys are way too easy. It's too easy sometimes.
[3416.60s -> 3437.06s]  It really is. How do I do it? You gotta like lift your head up and go. When do I plan on ending my
[3437.06s -> 3451.91s]  streaming career? I haven't thought about that. When I'm no longer having fun. That's real. When
[3451.91s -> 3456.07s]  I'm no longer enjoying what I'm doing. When I'm not having fun anymore. When I'm not enjoying
[3456.07s -> 3469.50s]  it anymore. I'm not gonna do it. You know. I'm not gonna give you. There's no time for it
[3469.50s -> 3475.30s]  there. That could be in 10 years. That could be in two years, six months. It could be
[3475.30s -> 3490.15s]  tomorrow. I could wake up tomorrow and be like, well, not tomorrow. Don't do it tomorrow. Tomorrow
[3490.15s -> 3500.02s]  is my birthday. No, I would. Okay, look, we would do. Here's what's gonna happen. I know it's not
[3500.02s -> 3503.30s]  called GeoGuessr. It's called GeoGuessr. Don't fucking stand there and talk about your life
[3503.30s -> 3510.89s]  story. I know. Listen, when I'm done, I will make it very clear. I'll make it incredibly
[3510.89s -> 3515.93s]  clear. I'm gonna be like, guys, we've had a really, really great time. I've been doing
[3515.93s -> 3523.53s]  this for like 25 years. I like to spend some time with my seven children. You know,
[3524.95s -> 3583.78s]  Dave, Danielle, Dave, Danielle, Donnie, Danielle too, Davey, Rick, and Dick. But you'll know.
[3583.78s -> 3609.59s]  I will have a retirement party. We're gonna have a retirement party for me. Not tomorrow.
[3609.59s -> 3621.59s]  I just went through the world. Dude, I teleported to the map. Barberville. Stop
[3621.59s -> 3629.26s]  doing that. Stop. What the hell? Let me see this. Oh my God. They bug in the fucking game's code.
[3629.26s -> 3642.25s]  The collision detection in this part of the world is just not very good. It was Barberville,
[3642.25s -> 3649.10s]  but no, no fucking around. No joking around. When I'm done, whenever that is,
[3650.25s -> 3654.09s]  I'll give everybody plenty of notice because what I don't want to have happen is to be like,
[3654.65s -> 3659.86s]  oh, hey, guys, I'm done. I'll see you later. I mean, there are people that, you know,
[3659.86s -> 3664.10s]  maybe just to subscribe to something like, I want to give you like a long time to know that's
[3664.10s -> 3677.98s]  coming. But I don't just, whenever that happens, it happens. I don't foresee it happening for a
[3677.98s -> 3696.22s]  while. Don't say anything and just disappear for five years. Burning out. I spend a very
[3696.22s -> 3708.60s]  large amount of my energy making sure I don't burn out. Injured. Is this Vegas? Those are
[3708.60s -> 3730.49s]  everywhere. Anti-burnout. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you guys know that. I take a lot of time
[3730.49s -> 3738.22s]  off. You know, like for instance, after this, I'm going to just take two days off. That's not
[3738.22s -> 3743.50s]  because I just want to make sure that I'm like ready to go. You know, I take time off each week
[3746.95s -> 3752.79s]  specifically to prevent the feeling of like burning out and being like, I got a stream.
[3752.79s -> 3755.91s]  I want to do this. I want to do that. I'm getting, it's too much. It's too much. It's
[3755.91s -> 3771.83s]  too much because it can, that can happen. What does that say? This is like home of 2015
[3771.83s -> 3784.74s]  junior Olympic gold medalist in gymnastics. I don't know who that is. What about the next
[3784.74s -> 3796.58s]  one? Home of Brian Kilgore. Original bad boy. MMA 2011 Hall of Fame. Why are there just like,
[3796.58s -> 3811.43s]  here are the celebrities that, I don't know, what does that mean? This is a really,
[3811.43s -> 3823.13s]  really nice looking place though. I can't wait till I get mine. Las Vegas. Home of the
[3823.13s -> 3835.62s]  German 985. What's going to happen? There's a way till I got my own casino. This is, yeah,
[3835.62s -> 3843.18s]  this is down south somewhere. Wrong way. Mokka. No, I'm not going to say Mokka S again.
[3843.18s -> 3893.30s]  I have my guess. That was so close. Oh, we did it again. I'm just like, I can sell,
[3893.30s -> 3899.06s]  I can sell it. I can put an M in there after the S. I can just, you know, I can taste it.
[3900.90s -> 3921.26s]  Kibbe Dome. This looks, this looks kind of like New England. It does. I feel like I'm in New
[3921.26s -> 3943.24s]  England. Did I recognize anything? Subs go that way. Student Rec. I'm in like a college.
[3943.80s -> 3963.16s]  What college am I in? This is a college. Stadium. University of Idaho. All right,
[3963.16s -> 3970.46s]  where's the University of Idaho? I don't really feel like I'm in New England.
[3970.46s -> 3986.39s]  Where's the University of Idaho? I know it's in Idaho. What are you looking at? I love how
[3986.39s -> 4015.69s]  they blurred this out too. Campus Walk. Whoa, what a cool campus. This is just basketball hoops
[4015.69s -> 4036.66s]  on the walk. In my college we just played a game of who could put the head in the trash can
[4036.66s -> 4055.02s]  the longest without throwing up. That's all we had. No, of course I didn't win. This is
[4055.02s -> 4061.50s]  not a drinking thing. This is just a thing thing. It's like, ah, I'm bored. Me, I'm
[4061.50s -> 4068.82s]  bored too. I'm very bored. You want to play, you want to play smell the can? Uh, yeah, sure. I don't
[4068.82s -> 4085.35s]  got class for like another 40 minutes. I need like a city. It's gonna be like admissions or
[4085.35s -> 4093.53s]  something. Teaching and Learning Center. Why don't you just name this the Education Center?
[4093.53s -> 4102.89s]  Isn't that too wordy? The Teaching and Learning Center? The Education Center. Too many words.
[4114.18s -> 4123.18s]  Idaho Comm. I gotta get out of the college. It looks like the exit. I gotta find the
[4123.18s -> 4139.91s]  signs and find the exit. Is this Campus Walk? No, it's over here. Life Sciences. This way.
[4139.91s -> 4165.75s]  University. Let's get out. Out. Out. University. Get out. Admission. No, I get me out of the
[4165.75s -> 4186.71s]  college. How big is this college? All right, I made it. Welcome to Moscow. Moscow, Idaho.
[4186.79s -> 4201.85s]  Okay, so it is Russia. We were right. Every time. Watch this be actually in Russia. No,
[4201.85s -> 4210.28s]  that would be impossible. All right, Moscow, Idaho. Let's go look it up. What do you guys
[4210.28s -> 4216.58s]  think? Do you think it's um, I'm just realizing this right now. Idaho is just a gigantic flipped
[4216.58s -> 4240.50s]  New Hampshire. It's weird. Moscow. Okay, Moscow. We're looking for Moscow. Oh, get out of
[4240.50s -> 4257.02s]  here. University. Where is it? University of Idaho. I'll take 5,000 points please. All right,
[4257.02s -> 4275.93s]  that's close enough. What's going on here? What's this weird? Did somebody ran my camera over with
[4275.93s -> 4306.74s]  a green tire? Why did we get slimed? This camera's broken. 55 speed limit? No, that's
[4306.74s -> 4313.67s]  too easy to do that. It's too easy to just bait everybody here to say like, oh look at
[4313.67s -> 4318.39s]  those dogs or something like that. Everyone's going to be like, what? That's way too easy.
[4319.03s -> 4342.09s]  Look at those lions. This camera is pissing me off. Road may flood. This really is just
[4342.65s -> 4354.17s]  almost like concrete how flat this all is. Yeah, I even get like the urge to just sprint
[4354.73s -> 4360.79s]  just this way. Just drink a bunch of water and just run as fast as you fucking possibly
[4360.79s -> 4375.43s]  can that way. Or just like a sled. You know, one of those body boogie board sleds,
[4377.27s -> 4382.39s]  just cover in oil and just sprint as fast as you fucking can and just jump and slide and you
[4382.39s -> 4393.94s]  probably go the whole thing. You know, go get in a bowling alley, cover the bowling alley bed
[4393.94s -> 4398.79s]  thing with oil and slide on it. I made this fucking joke two days ago, except it was a
[4398.79s -> 4413.40s]  much smaller scale. Have we got signs? No. Yeah, this is out. This is out like here
[4413.40s -> 4425.16s]  somewhere. This is like, who fucking has any idea? We could be on this road for miles.
[4428.34s -> 4434.07s]  This is scary to, all right, those of you guys that live in a place like this,
[4434.07s -> 4442.60s]  an area like this, aren't you afraid to go anywhere? You need a full tank of gas.
[4443.32s -> 4453.53s]  If you don't have a full tank, this is scary. Even if you have a full tank of gas,
[4459.61s -> 4465.72s]  you, something happens out here. Wait, what are you going to go? You're going to walk?
[4471.80s -> 4475.40s]  You better get your sprinting ability up because you're going to have to go that way.
[4479.27s -> 4491.22s]  Okay. What about, I would feel like I would want like extra gas. It'd be terrifying.
[4491.22s -> 4502.23s]  I'll fill the tank up. Can I put like six tanks of gas in my back seat? I would be
[4502.23s -> 4517.70s]  scared to do this. I would. I would be scared. I'd be scared. Kent, we are in Kent,
[4519.48s -> 4532.44s]  Kent, Nebraska or something. Kent, Nebraska, Kent. Okay. We're in Kent, but where, what is Kent?
[4542.84s -> 4553.30s]  What is that? Is that, is this a handmade, a homemade helicopter? This is a flying machine.
[4553.86s -> 4562.10s]  This is a homemade flying machine. Oh no, it's perspective. It's going that way. Okay. I
[4562.10s -> 4570.23s]  thought this was like one unit. Okay. I thought this was one thing. Okay. No, it's
[4570.23s -> 4585.13s]  just like a watering centipede. It's a centipede irrigator. I get it. Look at those dogs. Look at
[4585.13s -> 4617.54s]  those dogs. Kent, a human irrigator. What would a human irrigator be this way or that way? Would
[4617.54s -> 4626.90s]  you like just put water in your mouth and just spray it? All right. Time to take a guess. I
[4626.90s -> 4635.14s]  think this is like somewhere in like Oklahoma, Kentucky, Dakota, one of the Dakotas. What's
[4635.14s -> 4652.33s]  that say? Does that say Alabama? Does that say Alabama? Dot Alabama? Alabama? Oh, it's right
[4652.33s -> 4669.90s]  here. North. I can't see. Oh, train! That was bad. I know. Look, people are just doing
[4669.90s -> 4690.38s]  ASCII art in the channel and I had to, I've been paying attention to that. No joke, until I
[4690.38s -> 4705.08s]  was 17, I thought it was Abba Llama. No, no, not me. Somebody in chat said that. I'm
[4705.08s -> 4718.38s]  repeating what somebody said. Speaking of llamas, here they are. That's a lot of them.
[4718.38s -> 4735.27s]  What does that sign say? I'm about to give up and just fucking guess. Arcadia, Kansas. Arcadia,
[4735.27s -> 4755.34s]  Kansas. Arcadia. It's a long road. I'm going to say over here. Arcadia. Opica.
[4755.34s -> 4813.83s]  Arcadia. California. Arcadia. Garden City. Dodge City. Jaxmoor. It was in Missouri.
[4813.83s -> 4828.90s]  Oh, there's the liberal. Okay, so we weren't in something called Kent. It was close. Close enough.
[4828.90s -> 4853.08s]  We go that way. We've got to turn. We're gonna go backwards now. Okay, this is Russia. Again,
[4853.08s -> 4867.19s]  same signs. Remember these signs? Russia. Good luck. Yeah, those are universal Russian signs.
[4867.19s -> 4882.84s]  I don't know. I have no idea what that is. I don't know what that means. Does this mean
[4882.84s -> 4888.33s]  the cars are coming real? Okay, here's what I get from this. Cars on the other side of the
[4888.33s -> 4894.76s]  road have a much higher speed limit than our side here. So cars on this side are going to
[4894.76s -> 4902.70s]  be going like 80. So be aware of that because it's like 25-30 on this side. And the top is
[4902.70s -> 4913.13s]  just like a wine bottle. Or does that... Okay, so that means that the road narrows to a point
[4913.93s -> 4917.53s]  where you have to go like one mile per hour through a tiny little opening.
[4930.36s -> 4944.78s]  More just like cars on the side of the road. Who owns these cars? Just nothing from
[4944.78s -> 4968.39s]  miles. This is this person's house. That's squished. What does this one say? This says
[4974.79s -> 4997.05s]  300 miles to... I don't know. What the hell are they talking about?
[4997.85s -> 5004.90s]  If you drink two cups of coffee a day, it helps with dry eyes. It wasn't that bad.
[5005.46s -> 5014.86s]  This is Ukraine. All right. Did all right over here in America. Not so good over here.
[5014.94s -> 5018.38s]  Actually, yeah, it's beside... Russia is... I'm telling you, Russia is hard mode.
[5020.20s -> 5042.84s]  I'll do one more. Let's do one more. Same app. Let's go. Now, this is absolutely New England.
[5042.84s -> 5051.18s]  Yes, it is. This is New England somewhere. I'd be shocked if it wasn't. This is definitely
[5051.18s -> 5082.63s]  New England. How do I know? You just know. Yeah, you just know. Let's get to a main road.
[5082.63s -> 5098.95s]  Got like boats in the driveways. That's a big tell. The style of house. This is not
[5098.95s -> 5152.73s]  Florida. Let me do a main road. Okay, get out here. Can't see it from there. All right. All
[5152.73s -> 5158.02s]  right. All right. Here we go. Here we go. All right. Here we go. This is it. This is
[5159.72s -> 5190.98s]  definitely... This is like Cape Cod. This is Cape Cod, Massachusetts. I've seen a lot of
[5190.98s -> 5208.33s]  orange plates. That's Halloween. So this is Halloween on Cape Cod. Guys, this is...
[5208.33s -> 5222.57s]  Look at this shit. You telling me this is not New England? Here we go. Back it up. Back
[5222.57s -> 5233.91s]  it up. Back it up. Back it up. Back it up. Back it up. I gotta get this one. Watch out.
[5233.91s -> 5262.09s]  Risotto. Eatery. Italian eatery. Howard. Hector's Hardware. What's this? Tim Hor...
[5262.09s -> 5318.07s]  It's Canada. 800. Benchmark. Eyecare Vision Center. School. School. School. School.
[5325.70s -> 5362.78s]  I was right. I was right. I live here. Oh yeah, where is it then? Aggressive
[5362.78s -> 5382.39s]  Har... Oh, it's a law firm called JEP. Robo Mart. Mighty Taco. I was right. Benderson.
[5383.03s -> 5398.36s]  Benderson. Sounds like a name that I came up with. This looks like Massachusetts.
[5398.36s -> 5424.98s]  Oh, go back into the town square. This way. Spectrum. Oh shit. This is not Massachusetts.
[5424.98s -> 5438.38s]  Spectrum's not in Massachusetts. You know how I know that? Because it's just fucking Comcast.
[5439.66s -> 5474.84s]  There's a pocket this big for Verizon. No, no! Let's go this way. I got it. They're gonna be
[5474.84s -> 5505.43s]  transporting animals. Buffalo. That's down here. Would your child even know if they had
[5505.43s -> 5511.43s]  poor vision? One in four children have undiagnosed vision problems. Come and spend like 600 bucks.
[5511.43s -> 5531.88s]  I thought that was somebody in the window. I think a leaf hit the camera in the face.
[5535.10s -> 5545.08s]  What happened to this camera? Somebody like... Is the Incredible Hulk grabbing the lens right
[5545.08s -> 5557.34s]  now? This is like a Hulk smash right here. Well, we're gonna go this way because I can't see that
[5557.34s -> 5618.34s]  way. All right. Dr. Dr. Expedito. Dr. Expedito. Okay, so this is... Hulk out of my face. Okay,
[5618.34s -> 5675.58s]  this is... What does it say? Oficina Sal Severo e Servus e... More... I'd love to do this
[5675.58s -> 5692.62s]  one. It's somewhere in South America. Sign over there. Let's see if I can see it. It's got this
[5692.62s -> 5710.79s]  terrible view. Wrap around. Sign right here. There was a billboard here. What's this? I can't
[5710.79s -> 5740.63s]  go down there. Okay, here we go. What do we got? I want to see that one. Curao de Cima.
[5745.05s -> 5806.95s]  Queria Sao Jose. Sao Jose. The Bitcoin? Brazil. Brazil. Sao Jose, Brazil. Brazil's huge.
[5816.10s -> 5828.22s]  There's a lot of... There's a lot of places in Brazil. Wait, Sao... That's Rio de Janeiro.
[5847.29s -> 5860.41s]  What does it say here? Let's just guess. No, I thought it was closer to Rio de Janeiro.
[5860.41s -> 5868.42s]  This is up here. I didn't even say it, too, and it's a completely different name. All right,
[5868.42s -> 5916.63s]  next round. Another gigantic highway in Russia. No, stop! So every single time it's been Russia,
[5916.63s -> 5932.82s]  it's been the same spot. Maybe it's just never over here. All right, Russia, because that's
[5932.82s -> 5944.84s]  where the people live. Oh, okay. That makes it a little easier. You're clicking in the
[5944.84s -> 5953.45s]  Russian desert. Everybody in Russia lives in the same spot. There's no life east of Moscow.
[5953.45s -> 5970.22s]  I just keep clicking on the wilderness. Putin... Is this Russia again? That was just like Putin-ski.
[5970.22s -> 5985.58s]  There it is. There it is on the treasure map. It's right here. Dig here. You'll find it.
[5985.58s -> 6028.46s]  Coffee, rent, gas, or hardware? Mutine. I don't think this is Russia. I don't think so.
[6028.46s -> 6048.52s]  Duxtos. Duxtos sounds like the name of the town or the place. Duxtos or Duxtos. Same deal.
[6050.30s -> 6059.94s]  Further down. Much further. Much further. Much further. It's Duxtos Rio de Janeiro. I don't think
[6059.94s -> 6081.30s]  it is. Food and lodging? That's a tree next to a stool. I don't know what that means.
[6089.59s -> 6103.70s]  Why is it blurred out? All right, I'm gonna get off the highway here. Here we go. Here's some
[6103.70s -> 6109.58s]  more signs and civilization. Golf, swimming. All right, this is a recreational spot. Let's
[6109.58s -> 6164.94s]  get over here. What's that? The Meridian. The Meridian. The Le Meridian. Taxi. We're in
[6164.94s -> 6181.40s]  Europe. I just don't know where. I gotta get off the highway. I feel like we're gonna be
[6181.40s -> 6205.18s]  on this highway for a long time. Now we're opening up into driving through nowhere. I'm
[6205.18s -> 6233.21s]  going for it. I think I got it. I think I got it. At least close. Yep, Lithuania. I was
[6233.21s -> 6242.10s]  thinking Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Belarus. I didn't read chat for that one. Who wrote that?
[6242.10s -> 6254.10s]  Nobody did. Cheating. You can say that for everything, okay? Everything could be he read
[6254.10s -> 6262.33s]  it in chat. Everything. I don't get any credit. I love when I beat last boss,
[6262.33s -> 6268.25s]  Sekiro, and I did it. And you can't say that you read chat. You did it. I did that.
[6268.81s -> 6285.45s]  It makes me like, I did that. Remember that? We certainly helped. All right, this is the last
[6285.45s -> 6298.38s]  one. And then I'm gonna take off. Thank you for joining me on this relaxing stream. Okay,
[6298.38s -> 6309.82s]  I thought that was a tank. So that's a big tank. I have no idea what the hell this is.
[6317.83s -> 6340.36s]  Man filter. Okay. Man filter. Is this in English? Is it $33 a gallon? No, this is Russia.
[6359.78s -> 6370.60s]  Close. Close enough. View the summary. What we got. It would have been, actually,
[6370.68s -> 6375.88s]  I would have been really good. The only big outlier was this. Me clicking on the middle
[6375.88s -> 6382.76s]  of nowhere. I would have been up here. That would have been good. And that's it. We're
[6382.76s -> 6396.42s]  gonna do the bits. And I will see you all for some more VR on Tuesday. Tuesday. That one
[6396.42s -> 6406.22s]  doesn't count? Yeah, it does. Thank you to CAD for the amazing Jerma Slots game. There was a
[6406.22s -> 6410.65s]  lot more content in there than I think any of us ever could have imagined. So thank you
[6410.65s -> 6415.98s]  to those of you that worked on that game. It was great. Mr. Mosquito was actually really
[6415.98s -> 6426.39s]  interesting until that last level. And then, yeah, just another relaxing kind of chill day.
[6428.57s -> 6438.90s]  VR is coming back. You've raged quite a porn game. Well, good. That's not a big deal.
[6446.20s -> 6458.38s]  Let me move this off. Hey, you want some, like, radiance? That makeup ad has showed up.
[6458.38s -> 6463.18s]  I've given that, you guys have already seen ads. Give ads. You've seen this one already,
[6463.18s -> 6477.91s]  like, 30 or 40 times. So you already had ads. But I'll see you guys later. See you guys in
[6477.91s -> 6488.79s]  a couple days. On Tuesday, to be specific. Thank you everybody for coming out. Back to
[6488.79s -> 6504.15s]  the virtual world on Tuesday. Let us move this window here. And let's do the bits
[6505.11s -> 6514.07s]  from earlier, about six hours ago. What am I going to do in VR? Mind show. I'm going
[6514.07s -> 6518.63s]  to just start. We're just going to do mind show. I'm just going to start and do a
[6518.63s -> 6523.13s]  full stream in mind show. I've been putting it off because I know it's going to be a lot of
[6523.13s -> 6533.54s]  fun. So I want to have a dedicated day to it. The only reason why I would not do it then
[6534.18s -> 6536.98s]  is to do it on a weekend or something. But let's just let's just go for it.
[6540.07s -> 6550.30s]  But thank you too, to start it off our Lazy Luke with the $7777.77. Thank you. I've got
[6550.30s -> 6554.46s]  footage of you this morning realizing that you can't gamble your life savings on stream.
[6556.07s -> 6578.44s]  What is this? This is called another one of those videos. Thank you Lazy Luke for the
[6578.44s -> 6589.29s]  $7777. Appreciate it. Also thank you to Clive Ripp. Thank you with $5. These bits are to
[6589.29s -> 6603.05s]  give italics a wet willy. Thank you for the $5. How about I'll tell italics a funny joke instead.
[6604.81s -> 6611.16s]  Thank you for the five bucks. Hey Smelly Boy, thanks for the $250. Hope you realize this is
[6611.16s -> 6618.63s]  a borderline fetish game. Look, I played it for like an hour and a half and I realized
[6618.63s -> 6628.55s]  that I didn't want to play it anymore so I stopped playing it. Thank you for the $250.
[6631.32s -> 6641.37s]  Avev, thanks for the 10 bucks. Why are you naked if this isn't a porn game? I don't know. Thank
[6641.37s -> 6654.63s]  you for the $10 Avev. Dorkcube, thanks for the $250. Holy cow, Cad is an absolute legend. Hope
[6654.63s -> 6677.70s]  you make more games dude. I do too. Something to discuss because that was fantastic. Cad's still
[6677.70s -> 6689.45s]  here. No, that was a funny little easter egg joke thing that he did. But thank you
[6689.45s -> 6696.41s]  Dorkcube and yes again thank you to Cad. This is insane. Magical Marissa, another $10 on top of the
[6696.41s -> 6708.38s]  $60 you've already given tonight. Thank you for 10 more dollars here. They say auto. Auto. By the way,
[6709.74s -> 6717.53s]  Cad did mention that that game he's going to try to release it at the end of this stream.
[6718.47s -> 6723.27s]  But it might have to wait till Monday because of the way Steam works. So if it's not up
[6723.35s -> 6729.86s]  today for you just to download and play it however long you want, it will be available early next
[6729.86s -> 6734.42s]  week. Right? Is that correct? I want to make sure that's correct. Dermislots is the game we're
[6734.42s -> 6741.88s]  talking about. Showcased it on stream earlier. One is the scratch off. I'll make it clear one
[6741.88s -> 6745.96s]  more time because I know people are kind of trickling in and out. I cannot do the scratch
[6745.96s -> 6751.32s]  ticket thing in Nevada because there's no state lottery in Nevada. I did not know that
[6751.32s -> 6756.68s]  until this morning. So I cannot physically buy a scratch ticket. They do not exist
[6756.68s -> 6761.72s]  in the state of Nevada, unfortunately. I did not even know that until this morning.
[6763.42s -> 6773.86s]  So we will cross that bridge again. I have to drive to California. Road trip stream.
[6778.63s -> 6785.29s]  But thank you to omgtayon for the 250. Derma this is your family. We're all worried about
[6785.29s -> 6792.97s]  you and your gambling addiction you've developed. Please leave Las Vegas and come home. We hit
[6792.97s -> 6801.66s]  it though. We cheated but we hit it. Zanziman thanks for the 10 bucks. Derma I know it's not
[6801.66s -> 6814.14s]  much but here you need it more than me. Thank you for the 10 dollars. Zany. I think it's not
[6814.14s -> 6822.73s]  it's not Zanziman. It's Zany Zman. Appreciate the 10 bucks. Super Seal thanks for 250. Please
[6822.73s -> 6826.01s]  highlight this stream so that future generations can watch you play the best game ever.
[6827.11s -> 6835.11s]  Whether I'm referring to Mr. Mosquito or Derma Slots is up to you. It will be saved
[6835.11s -> 6841.58s]  forever. Ferodian weapon thanks for five dollars Ferodian. Hope you're having a good night. I
[6841.58s -> 6844.86s]  thought I'd contribute to your gambling addiction but seriously this game looks amazing. It even
[6844.86s -> 6853.72s]  makes me want to gamble. That's not that that was not my intention. If you're going to gamble
[6854.98s -> 6860.71s]  hopefully that you follow some very very basic rules. Rule number one make sure it's legal
[6860.71s -> 6867.21s]  where you live. Make sure you're old enough and it's legal. Rule number two if you're
[6867.21s -> 6873.24s]  going to gamble make sure you go into gambling with going to a casino or whatever you're doing.
[6874.46s -> 6880.62s]  Moderate yourself. Make sure you're doing it for fun not to actually make money. Do not try to
[6880.62s -> 6890.04s]  gamble to try to make money. He's promoting gambling. No I'm trying to be I'm trying to
[6890.04s -> 6908.79s]  promote responsible gaming. Just go to a casino and bet 221 dollars on roulette for black. That'd
[6908.79s -> 6913.88s]  be bad. That's the worst thing you could probably do but yeah thank you Ferodian for
[6913.88s -> 6921.70s]  the five dollars. Game responsibly. Tara Alekhren thanks for the three bucks.
[6922.44s -> 6928.52s]  Jerma I've been subbed for 32 months. Only a few more months until I'm in the three year club.
[6929.24s -> 6935.00s]  You got any plans for a three year sub badge so I can lord it over the filthy one and two year
[6935.00s -> 6947.58s]  plebs? Yes three years. Holy shit that's so long. Thank you Tara Alekhren for the continued
[6947.58s -> 6952.79s]  support forever. That's forever. That's as long as I've been streaming on twitch. I've been
[6952.79s -> 6962.70s]  streaming on twitch for about three and a half years. Four years almost. But yes there will be
[6962.70s -> 6974.07s]  three, six, twelve years whatever is available. You know the word I was trying to say. Thank you
[6974.07s -> 6977.59s]  something rather for the 250. How much will it take for you to release your hostages? I don't
[6977.59s -> 6987.29s]  have any hostages. Thank you for the 250. Pika Banana thanks for the 10 bucks. It's too bad
[6987.29s -> 6991.21s]  the scratches didn't work out but this has been an amazing stream anyway. You never failed
[6991.21s -> 7001.32s]  to crack me up. Love you Jerma Jerma Heart. Thank you for the 10 dollars and the incredibly
[7001.32s -> 7010.07s]  kind message. I had a lot of fun tonight. It was a just a it was like a shower a an absolute
[7010.07s -> 7019.75s]  shower of smiles that were on my face. It was great. Thank you for the 10 dollars
[7019.75s -> 7025.70s]  and supporting the stream. Dorkcube thanks for the 250. After watching you play Risk of Rain
[7025.70s -> 7031.06s]  2 I decided to try it. Unfortunately my laptop is garbage so I had to turn down all the
[7031.06s -> 7038.02s]  graphics settings. Did you know the game allows you to turn the textures to 1 30 1 32nd of their
[7038.02s -> 7046.42s]  full size? A 30 I can't even read that. 1 32th. What does that mean? How do I say this?
[7046.98s -> 7059.43s]  1 30th? How do you say this? Phonetically just put it in the chat. 1 32nd? But that doesn't
[7059.43s -> 7077.22s]  sound right. 1 32nd. I had it right the first time. It just sounds sounds weird to say it.
[7077.86s -> 7088.81s]  But thank you Dorkcube. Risk of Rain 2 is a lot of fun. I'm glad you're able to at least play it.
[7088.81s -> 7093.29s]  Tara Alecran thanks for the three dollars. If he isn't holding Cad hostage then why won't
[7093.29s -> 7098.65s]  he show his basement on stream right now? We see through your lies Jerma. Free Cad.
[7099.45s -> 7105.37s]  Well there's a funny thing to rebuttal this with. There is no such thing as a basement
[7105.37s -> 7121.98s]  in Las Vegas. The judge just tore up the prosecution and threw it in the air.
[7121.98s -> 7141.61s]  There are no basements in Las Vegas. Oh that's real convenient. No scratch tickets. No basement.
[7141.61s -> 7150.92s]  This is starting to sound fake as hell. We've seen zero proof that you're in Las Vegas.
[7152.71s -> 7157.35s]  Except for the balloon landing when I was surrounded by mountains and desert.
[7162.52s -> 7171.03s]  It was faked. It was a green screen. I'll end up doing a weird Las Vegas stream. Don't worry.
[7173.27s -> 7177.11s]  I'll be out there. There'll be some weird scenario. Well you're gonna see like the
[7177.11s -> 7191.70s]  whole strip or something maybe. But thank you Smelly Boy for the 250. GeoGuessr is unironically
[7191.70s -> 7198.47s]  my favorite game to watch you play. It's not a joke when we ask you to play. I know and I have
[7198.47s -> 7201.51s]  fun playing it and I think it's a lot it's a relaxing interesting fun game we can just kind
[7201.51s -> 7206.31s]  of talk about whatever. But the reason why I didn't play it for a while is because
[7207.35s -> 7213.27s]  it was sort of a crutch for a while right. We would just play it all the time. There was
[7213.27s -> 7218.15s]  like three or four cases in a row within a week or two weeks where it was like uh GeoGuessr.
[7219.54s -> 7224.20s]  So I kind of wanted to take a break from it. I played it a lot. It was like oh we've been
[7224.20s -> 7229.40s]  playing this game for like three four hours. This game kind of sucks but we might as well
[7229.40s -> 7235.32s]  play PictoPix right. That's become what PictoPix is. It's because of Comcast. Yeah that's true
[7235.32s -> 7241.05s]  but it was like a Comcast crutch. So I don't really need the Comcast crutch anymore. Although
[7241.05s -> 7250.30s]  Cox's as we've been aware hasn't been nearly as bad as what Comcast used to do but still
[7250.30s -> 7259.80s]  there's still our problem sometimes with Cox. Switch it out with Google Feud once in a while.
[7261.56s -> 7269.45s]  Yeah I really do like just playing browser games and hanging out. I want to do this more
[7269.45s -> 7277.94s]  often. We've talked about it already but I want to add more kind of hang out and doing
[7277.94s -> 7287.14s]  browser stuff. There's a lot more opportunity I think to interact and have conversations and
[7287.80s -> 7296.20s]  come up with scenarios and talk to each other and stuff. So I want to do more of this type
[7296.20s -> 7308.06s]  of thing not less. But thank you Smelly Boy. I do enjoy Neo uh it's almost I just said
[7309.02s -> 7325.59s]  NeoGuessr. NeoGuessr. Like for The Matrix. I don't know why. Weird. Neopets.
[7329.70s -> 7345.93s]  Neo. Imagine a GeoGuessr map in The Matrix. I don't know. Stream The Matrix
[7345.93s -> 7350.63s]  video game. It doesn't even work anymore. Isn't The Matrix online completely off? Is
[7350.63s -> 7359.32s]  the other one even worth playing? And then we had too many subs to even there was so
[7359.32s -> 7366.49s]  many community subs. Thank you everybody that decided to give a community sub because there
[7366.49s -> 7374.47s]  was a shitload of them like an hour ago. You guys are too kind. Thank you. Also Smelly
[7374.47s -> 7379.67s]  Boy thanks to the 250. Most of Russia in the East is Siberia. Nobody lives there. The
[7379.67s -> 7384.44s]  vast majority of the population is always in the West of Russia. I'll remember that for
[7384.44s -> 7392.06s]  next time. Flug Boy thanks to the 250. Hey Jerm I hope you're doing well. Just got into
[7392.06s -> 7398.65s]  a relationship with a very close friend of mine uh two years and been happier than ever.
[7399.21s -> 7403.45s]  But yeah pretty fun stuff. Hope you and Kim are doing great my guy. I always love her
[7403.45s -> 7412.01s]  posts of you and her on Twitter. Yeah I'm well first of all I'm glad you're uh doing
[7412.01s -> 7428.22s]  well in a relationship. Yeah Kim and I are doing great. She's she's my girl you know.
[7428.22s -> 7442.04s]  She's my girl. But thank you for the 250. Glad you've uh glad you're happy.
[7445.98s -> 7456.07s]  And here are the ton of community subs. So many of them. Five dollars from Moson.
[7456.79s -> 7461.11s]  I was in Boston for packs. Spent most of my time exploring Boston. An amazing city
[7461.67s -> 7469.29s]  but the Green Line can eat my ass. Yes I agree. The Green Line is horrible. The Green
[7469.29s -> 7479.83s]  Line is always packed. It's always hard to navigate. That is a true state. I'm glad you
[7479.83s -> 7485.35s]  had fun. Boston is a really really nice city. Thank you the five dollars. Hope you enjoyed
[7485.35s -> 7489.99s]  packs. Kind of sad that I wasn't able to be there. That would be the first time in
[7490.89s -> 7495.88s]  its inception. I've been to every single packs East since they started the first time.
[7500.47s -> 7506.15s]  Didn't get to make it this year. But thank you Freudian Weapon for the five dollars.
[7509.08s -> 7514.54s]  250 here twice in a row. You're as young as you feel. Dressed the way you like. Age
[7514.54s -> 7522.78s]  doesn't have a dress code. Yeah I know I was just kidding around. I was just kidding around.
[7522.78s -> 7527.51s]  And then they also say if you were to hang up the streaming hat tomorrow I would respect
[7527.51s -> 7532.66s]  your decision and wish you well on your future endeavors. Jeremy Hart. Thank you.
[7537.05s -> 7543.96s]  Yeah I never it's never gonna be a scenario where I just disappear. It would be something
[7543.96s -> 7549.64s]  that you guys would know what's happening. I'd say you know that's it. I had a lot of fun.
[7549.64s -> 7553.83s]  I want to move on to other things. But I don't think I would be able to stay away.
[7555.05s -> 7558.17s]  I think I would probably still okay let's say if I stopped streaming completely right.
[7558.73s -> 7565.77s]  Whenever that was whenever that will be. Or stop making streams or videos or your content
[7565.77s -> 7571.21s]  online content media or whatever you want to call it. I would still probably poke my head
[7571.21s -> 7577.00s]  around you know once a week or once every few weeks or something. Turn a stream on just hang
[7577.00s -> 7583.96s]  out do something fun. I really don't think I would ever be gone forever completely from the
[7583.96s -> 7595.61s]  platform. You know I mean it would just be I don't think I would be able to do that.
[7605.90s -> 7615.14s]  But that's not in the cards in any sort of immediate sense. I have absolutely no plans to
[7615.14s -> 7622.70s]  stop. But I do need to acknowledge the fact that if I ever don't want to do it anymore
[7622.70s -> 7628.63s]  and I don't you know not having fun anymore. I've done things that I want to do. I think
[7628.63s -> 7635.13s]  I would probably want to eventually you know do something else. I don't know. I don't have a
[7635.13s -> 7640.46s]  number for that. I don't have a time frame for that. But I think I need to be honest with
[7640.46s -> 7649.86s]  everybody. Sure it's easy to be like streams forever. This is it's until I'm 80. But I don't
[7649.86s -> 7664.10s]  know that that's I don't know if that's gonna happen. I'm currently enjoying it.
[7664.97s -> 7672.74s]  Something I love to do. I love being on stream. I love being part of the community. I love
[7672.74s -> 7676.90s]  seeing all this shit. I love doing all these things. So I don't have it's not gonna stop
[7676.90s -> 7686.86s]  anytime soon. There you go. Quarter dime thanks to the five dollars. Just disappear for five years
[7686.86s -> 7697.74s]  and then come back with a turban or and telling us how you found faith. Or like just going like
[7697.74s -> 7715.78s]  a religious journey and come back. I don't think I would do that. Disappear for five years and
[7715.78s -> 7723.64s]  come back as like a preacher or something. Would you be interested in becoming the next joker if
[7723.64s -> 7736.26s]  DC contacted you? No. Nope. Now the Riddler. You got an opportunity.
[7739.82s -> 7752.62s]  Somebody already said it. I didn't even need to do it. How much would you do it for? 40 bucks.
[7754.42s -> 7766.18s]  But I want five percent of all royalties from the movie. No no I want I want 0.2 percent of
[7766.18s -> 7777.40s]  all revenue the movie makes. I'll do it for 40 dollars. It's gonna flop. No it's gonna have
[7777.40s -> 7785.66s]  at least like a 74 percent on Rotten Tomatoes. I'll make sure of that. Yeah well the movie really
[7785.66s -> 7791.42s]  sucked. Terrible writing. Awful awful direction. The cinematography. The story was all over the
[7791.42s -> 7800.30s]  place but you just couldn't take your eyes off Jeremy Elbertson's performance. And then
[7800.30s -> 7802.86s]  they go you know on Rotten Tomatoes you have the thing with a guy the person would write
[7802.86s -> 7808.70s]  the thing. Even the skill of Jeremy Elbertson cannot hold this mess together. I don't care if
[7808.70s -> 7822.23s]  it gets a 30 percent on Rotten Tomatoes. I'll carry it. The Great Lord Walden. 50 dollars right
[7822.23s -> 7832.58s]  now. 5,000 bits from The Great Lord Walden. Thank you so much for the 5,000 bits. It's my
[7832.58s -> 7839.77s]  birthday today. I'm 33. Feeling Jerma old tonight. Thanks for everything you do. I'm 33 too.
[7841.61s -> 7847.85s]  34 this year. Happy birthday Great Lord Walden. Thank you for the 50 dollars.
[7848.49s -> 7853.88s]  You're not you don't you never you never feel you're never too old.
[7854.44s -> 7871.32s]  No you don't feel old. We're young. 33 is the new 20. 40 is the new 30. I know it is. I'm
[7871.32s -> 7880.65s]  telling you it is. 50 will always be 50. 50 is not the new 50 or the old. 50 is just 50 and
[7880.65s -> 7886.65s]  then from that point forward 50 is just the 50. You're gone. You're out. 55 you can retire.
[7888.41s -> 7909.27s]  40 is the new 30. 50 still 50. I'm not gonna feel old until I'm 49 and one day till my birthday.
[7909.27s -> 7924.41s]  You're allowed to feel old when you're 50. Jerma can run for president in two months. No I
[7924.41s -> 7937.03s]  can't. It's 35. I cannot run for president yet. It's gonna have to be Jerma 2021.
[7937.67s -> 7952.65s]  I mean yeah I can. It's 34. It would have to be Jerma 2024. He's thought about it.
[7952.65s -> 7965.37s]  No it's just something that you are told in middle school. I want to ask if you're interested
[7965.37s -> 7970.07s]  in any game recommendations. If you have recommendations throw them in the recommendation
[7970.07s -> 7976.70s]  channel on the discord. I check it all the time. Everyone's thought about it. Yeah everybody's
[7976.70s -> 7987.74s]  thought about it. Five more community subs on top of everything. Thank you so much for the
[7987.74s -> 8004.42s]  five community subs. That was from BlackDymo. Thank you BlackDymo. Didn't get one. Oh what's
[8004.42s -> 8016.66s]  the discord? Here it is. It is a public discord. There is a sub channel but it's open to the public.
[8016.66s -> 8025.78s]  It's a great community there. But thank you great Lord Walden for the 50 dollars and happy
[8025.78s -> 8035.86s]  birthday again. Also a little bit further back here we had a quarter dime thanks to the five
[8035.86s -> 8044.87s]  bucks. I think didn't get you before. We read your message but I don't think I even said your
[8044.87s -> 8051.69s]  name. But that was quarter dime for five dollars. Thank you. Juno Upseto thanks for the
[8051.69s -> 8058.12s]  250. The leaf in front of the camera is actually GeoGuessr hard mode. It did make it pretty hard.
[8063.05s -> 8069.93s]  Great Lord Walden's got 82 gifted subs. Some of you guys you wonder how my sub count is so high.
[8071.61s -> 8078.39s]  There are at least a few dozen of you guys that have 50 to 100 each gifted subs.
[8081.08s -> 8099.99s]  That's it's just bonkers. A simple way I can share the love. Well I really appreciate that.
[8100.71s -> 8110.54s]  Thank you. Clueless Sniper thanks for the 250. No message just 250. Thank you Clueless Sniper.
[8111.56s -> 8118.34s]  Novi333 thanks for the three dollars and 33 cents. No message just 333. Novi coming in.
[8120.87s -> 8124.81s]  Freudian thanks for the 250. Pretty sure I spammed bit messages tonight.
[8124.81s -> 8131.62s]  Whoops a bad habit of mine I suppose. Anyhow happy Saturday. No you've got like three or four
[8131.62s -> 8142.89s]  here. Spam? What are you talking about? Thank you for the 250. Have a happy Saturday.
[8147.74s -> 8156.14s]  And then we also had Jerma lied about Minecraft VR with five more community subs bringing them
[8156.14s -> 8164.92s]  to 220 gifted subs. Yes I guess that you heard that correct. 220 gifted subs.
[8172.86s -> 8186.12s]  That's so many. Thank you Jerma lied about Minecraft VR for your monster sub gifting.
[8192.97s -> 8197.91s]  Thank you. Crimbalt thanks for the 250. Hello Sire I was just wondering if you saw
[8197.91s -> 8201.19s]  the trailer for the sequel to Hollow Knight. I don't know if you ever get to finish the
[8201.19s -> 8204.87s]  first one. Would be interested in this one but regardless I love all your streams.
[8205.75s -> 8217.91s]  I have seen the second game. I will probably play it. There's a Hollow Knight sequel.
[8218.55s -> 8228.36s]  At least there is a Hollow Knight sequel. Let's run the credits. That's it for the bits
[8228.36s -> 8239.26s]  for the most part. Thank you everybody. Here come the names. Thanks for supporting the stream.
[8242.89s -> 8258.06s]  All of you. Read them. Go go go. Ding. Two state taco. Poopy ass.
[8261.75s -> 8267.34s]  I used to, I used to read these. Remember when I used to really give it a really solid
[8267.34s -> 8281.10s]  attempt and it was so much slower. Sometimes it would be like this. But it's like this
[8281.10s -> 8298.41s]  almost every time now. You guys understand how fucking ridiculous that is? Well Jerma lied about
[8298.41s -> 8303.61s]  Gwere. Jerma lied about like Gwere? Like the song thing? What is with these all these
[8303.61s -> 8314.98s]  Jerma lied about this. Jerma lied about that. Jerma lied about Gwere. What the fuck.
[8319.18s -> 8324.22s]  Somebody asked a quarter dime asked hey Jerma if I were to go watch an old stream of yours
[8324.22s -> 8338.02s]  any old stream which would you choose and why um probably sorcery sorcery is the first
[8339.08s -> 8344.92s]  real stream attempt that I really did on a schedule or doing twitch instead of youtube
[8348.54s -> 8354.46s]  and I would probably say that those a lot of stream jokes and a lot of classic references
[8356.02s -> 8364.41s]  even to stuff that's still in the chat now stuff like sus um the green screen stream
[8364.41s -> 8370.82s]  was so much fun there's been so many there's been too many all of them except for skate three
[8370.82s -> 8375.86s]  don't watch that one don't watch the karazhan stream don't watch the mario tennis stream don't
[8375.86s -> 8393.00s]  watch um spell a few others don't watch the neo stream rick and morty that was fine the
[8393.00s -> 8401.66s]  handheld game no watch the handheld game stream that's one of my favorites rick and morty was
[8401.66s -> 8406.78s]  awful yeah but was that my fault or was that the game's fault maybe it was a little
[8406.78s -> 8415.98s]  bit but i was really tired i was so tired when we got to rick and morty both i mean it wasn't
[8415.98s -> 8421.18s]  my i was so tired i just couldn't even do anything and i gave up even 10 of the way
[8421.18s -> 8431.75s]  through i just couldn't do it it was chat's fault but that wasn't okay it was minecraft
[8431.75s -> 8438.39s]  vr and then rick and morty so that stream was good i like that was a lot of fun but
[8438.39s -> 8442.46s]  the rick and morty portion of that stream that's not the whole i'm talking about a
[8442.46s -> 8453.67s]  whole stream the skate three stream was a whole stream but i'll see you guys in a few days
