[21.62s -> 23.62s]  I fixed it. I fixed it. Okay. Hi.
[23.62s -> 24.92s]  Hey, how are you?
[24.92s -> 27.48s]  Actually muted. Not anymore.
[27.48s -> 31.18s]  How do I sound?
[31.18s -> 32.58s]  What do you guys think?
[32.58s -> 36.60s]  Do you like the new audio? Do you think it sounds alright?
[36.60s -> 39.19s]  How does it sound?
[39.19s -> 43.15s]  Welcome back. How are you?
[43.15s -> 44.85s]  It sounds like shit.
[44.85s -> 49.85s]  It does not sound like shit, okay?
[49.85s -> 52.95s]  By the way, I only stream every three or four days.
[52.95s -> 55.15s]  So, I already know the joke.
[55.15s -> 57.15s]  I already know the funny joke.
[57.15s -> 66.60s]  To put the mute thing up.
[66.70s -> 70.92s]  You sound like you're in my head. Please get out of here.
[70.92s -> 76.44s]  You sound like old Jerma.
[76.44s -> 78.87s]  It sounds too clean.
[78.87s -> 80.67s]  It does sound worse.
[80.67s -> 82.67s]  No, it doesn't.
[82.67s -> 84.27s]  You know what the funniest part about this?
[84.27s -> 86.57s]  In like three days, you guys will get used to this.
[86.57s -> 94.44s]  And it'll just be normal.
[94.44s -> 96.34s]  You sound like a 16-year-old.
[96.34s -> 97.84s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[97.84s -> 101.37s]  Hold on. Let me listen to it. Let me see how it sounds.
[101.37s -> 133.13s]  You sound like 2010 Andy.
[133.13s -> 135.23s]  This is what I hear.
[135.23s -> 136.63s]  Okay?
[136.73s -> 142.63s]  I am a quarter of a second delayed in my head.
[142.63s -> 148.85s]  So, I'm listening to myself talking
[148.85s -> 169.62s]  and I'm a quarter of a second delayed in my head.
[169.62s -> 171.22s]  Okay, I have to mute that.
[171.22s -> 182.21s]  I was hearing myself in my ears a quarter of a second after I talked.
[182.21s -> 186.53s]  Okay. You sound like a librarian.
[186.53s -> 187.53s]  I don't sound like a librarian.
[187.53s -> 188.93s]  Look, it's going to take a little bit of tweaking.
[188.93s -> 190.83s]  I just got it set up.
[190.83s -> 191.83s]  It's going to take some tweaking.
[191.83s -> 194.36s]  It's going to take some finagling.
[194.36s -> 198.01s]  It's fine.
[198.01s -> 203.43s]  You sound like a podcast host.
[203.43s -> 205.63s]  Well, okay, what's worse podcast host
[205.63s -> 208.43s]  or Jerma, please go back to the setup you had.
[208.43s -> 212.69s]  You sound like you were in my bathroom.
[212.69s -> 215.26s]  I don't think there's any compression even on.
[215.26s -> 217.16s]  All right. Let's do a test. Ready?
[217.16s -> 218.73s]  You guys can help me.
[218.73s -> 220.33s]  All right. This is going to be a quick test.
[220.33s -> 225.48s]  We're going to see how you guys feel about this.
[225.48s -> 228.52s]  How do you guys feel about this?
[228.52s -> 230.32s]  I turned off some setting
[230.32s -> 234.72s]  and now it sounds probably really awful.
[234.72s -> 236.49s]  That sounds better.
[236.49s -> 237.59s]  That's perfect.
[237.59s -> 240.78s]  It sounds like an Xbox 360.
[240.78s -> 242.78s]  Your voice is too crackly.
[242.78s -> 244.58s]  It sounds exactly the same.
[244.58s -> 248.16s]  Worse.
[248.16s -> 250.09s]  It sounds the same.
[250.09s -> 251.29s]  Okay.
[251.29s -> 252.53s]  How about now?
[252.53s -> 255.26s]  How does that sound?
[255.26s -> 256.46s]  Do you guys like this better?
[256.46s -> 258.46s]  Are you happier with this setup?
[258.46s -> 259.66s]  Does this sound better?
[259.66s -> 264.45s]  If I were to turn it up?
[264.45s -> 265.25s]  It's very quiet.
[265.25s -> 266.75s]  Well, okay.
[266.75s -> 268.45s]  So how about this?
[268.45s -> 269.55s]  You tell me. You tell me.
[269.55s -> 270.55s]  We'll figure this out.
[270.55s -> 272.52s]  We'll figure this out.
[272.52s -> 273.52s]  How do you sound now?
[273.52s -> 277.20s]  How you doing?
[277.20s -> 280.48s]  Now you're too loud.
[280.48s -> 282.66s]  Sound like a podcaster.
[282.66s -> 283.96s]  That sounds really good.
[283.96s -> 288.08s]  That was better before.
[288.08s -> 289.18s]  I can't tell the difference.
[289.18s -> 292.08s]  How do you sound?
[292.08s -> 295.86s]  It's really too quiet.
[295.86s -> 298.16s]  You sound like SpongeBob.
[298.16s -> 303.05s]  What?
[303.05s -> 307.56s]  It sounds like SpongeBob?
[307.56s -> 308.76s]  Somebody said that's good,
[308.76s -> 310.76s]  but you have the mute thing on.
[310.76s -> 312.06s]  So you're full of shit.
[312.06s -> 313.66s]  And look, there's no compressor on now.
[313.66s -> 315.86s]  So if I get loud, it's going to hurt your ears.
[315.86s -> 317.06s]  Hold on.
[317.06s -> 318.16s]  I have to...
[318.16s -> 318.96s]  We're going back to this one.
[318.96s -> 320.16s]  Oh my God.
[320.16s -> 321.66s]  Okay.
[321.66s -> 323.56s]  All right. I don't fucking care.
[323.56s -> 325.76s]  My audio setup has sucked asshole
[325.76s -> 328.46s]  since I started fucking YouTube back in like 2010.
[328.46s -> 329.46s]  Okay.
[329.46s -> 330.76s]  Are you really here for the audio?
[330.76s -> 331.86s]  Are you here for the audio?
[331.86s -> 333.06s]  Are you here for the audio?
[333.06s -> 337.87s]  Is that what you're here for?
[337.87s -> 340.28s]  Huh?
[340.28s -> 341.48s]  You're here for the audio?
[341.48s -> 343.18s]  I look like my fucking dad.
[343.18s -> 346.21s]  Hold on.
[346.21s -> 351.38s]  Are you even here for the audio?
[351.38s -> 352.94s]  Okay. There we go.
[352.94s -> 353.34s]  How do you...
[353.34s -> 354.24s]  I think that sounds fine.
[354.24s -> 354.84s]  Let me listen to it.
[354.84s -> 356.97s]  Let me see how it sounds.
[356.97s -> 357.77s]  Let me get it.
[357.77s -> 361.39s]  I haven't changed my audio setup in like fucking four and a half years.
[361.39s -> 362.58s]  Okay.
[362.58s -> 363.68s]  I think this sounds fine.
[363.68s -> 365.32s]  This really does.
[365.32s -> 366.52s]  Holy shit.
[366.52s -> 368.48s]  Complainer Andes.
[368.48s -> 369.88s]  This sounds fucking fine.
[369.88s -> 371.48s]  This sounds flawless.
[371.48s -> 373.38s]  If I get a little closer to the microphone,
[373.38s -> 375.71s]  by the way, it's up here now.
[375.71s -> 377.85s]  This sounds fucking flawless.
[377.85s -> 378.45s]  This sounds...
[378.45s -> 380.14s]  Let me get loud.
[380.14s -> 380.84s]  It's too...
[380.84s -> 382.18s]  It's too loud.
[382.18s -> 383.28s]  Oh, it's too loud.
[383.28s -> 384.48s]  Oh, it's too soft.
[384.48s -> 387.68s]  I need the band that's just right.
[387.68s -> 390.64s]  Hold on.
[390.64s -> 396.57s]  A bunch of fucking Goldilocks Andes.
[396.57s -> 402.34s]  I have to stop monitoring because I can't even talk.
[402.34s -> 404.44s]  How many times am I going to say Andy in the same day?
[404.44s -> 405.60s]  Okay.
[405.60s -> 407.00s]  I think it sounds great.
[407.00s -> 408.30s]  I'm ready.
[408.30s -> 413.76s]  That last bit sounded weird when you went high-pitched.
[413.76s -> 415.46s]  Microphones are fucking stupid.
[415.46s -> 416.36s]  Microphones suck.
[416.36s -> 418.06s]  And like you're in a different place too.
[418.06s -> 418.66s]  I moved my...
[418.66s -> 419.76s]  Look, this is here.
[419.76s -> 420.66s]  It's in the way.
[420.66s -> 421.06s]  Look at this.
[421.06s -> 423.46s]  I don't even want to move it because I got it on the right spot.
[423.46s -> 425.69s]  This thing is aiming at me.
[425.69s -> 428.57s]  I have this thing that's like aiming directly at me.
[428.57s -> 432.04s]  It's literally aiming at me.
[432.04s -> 434.28s]  It's freaking me out.
[434.28s -> 435.68s]  It actually is kind of freaking me out.
[435.68s -> 440.14s]  This thing is literally aiming at me like a cannon.
[440.14s -> 442.99s]  Dude, you got a duck.
[442.99s -> 444.35s]  All right, we're good.
[444.35s -> 445.75s]  You sound like you have auto-tune on.
[445.75s -> 446.65s]  No, I do not.
[446.65s -> 447.15s]  I do not.
[447.15s -> 450.35s]  I sat there for fucking an hour holding my hands like this
[450.35s -> 454.75s]  and talking and going like ABCDE, ABCDE, ABCDE.
[454.75s -> 456.32s]  And I was like, that sounds fine.
[456.32s -> 463.09s]  So we're going to keep it the way it is.
[463.09s -> 469.20s]  Check the gain.
[469.20s -> 470.47s]  I think it's fine.
[470.47s -> 473.33s]  It's fine.
[473.33s -> 475.13s]  Look, I have to turn my gain up because...
[475.13s -> 482.22s]  Look, listen.
[482.22s -> 483.76s]  Why can't I talk?
[483.76s -> 485.92s]  This is like froze up.
[485.92s -> 487.12s]  Listen to me.
[487.12s -> 487.92s]  Where? There you are.
[487.92s -> 489.02s]  You're in a different spot now.
[489.02s -> 491.12s]  Like the chat's like over here now.
[491.12s -> 492.12s]  Like you're over there.
[492.12s -> 493.92s]  I don't like this new thing.
[493.92s -> 496.32s]  I'm going back to what it was in 2012
[496.32s -> 498.30s]  when I used to hold the mic like this
[498.30s -> 503.24s]  because I didn't have a mic stand.
[503.24s -> 505.04s]  The laugh had a distortion on it.
[505.04s -> 508.78s]  Well, we'll figure it out some other day.
[508.78s -> 510.98s]  My audio has been too low.
[510.98s -> 514.61s]  People have complained about how I'm not loud enough.
[514.61s -> 516.51s]  It seems that the laugh had a tinny sound.
[516.51s -> 517.45s]  Hold on.
[517.45s -> 518.45s]  I know. Look, trust me.
[518.45s -> 519.65s]  We'll get on with it.
[519.65s -> 521.14s]  Just hold on.
[521.14s -> 522.24s]  Let me see.
[522.24s -> 526.21s]  So when I laughed, it was a tinny sound.
[531.68s -> 532.28s]  Oh my God.
[532.28s -> 534.77s]  That is weird.
[536.14s -> 536.64s]  What the fuck?
[536.64s -> 539.02s]  Why is it doing that?
[545.52s -> 547.32s]  You're the loudest person on Twitch?
[547.32s -> 548.42s]  No, I'm not.
[548.42s -> 550.94s]  Why is it doing that?
[550.94s -> 552.04s]  Why is it doing that?
[552.04s -> 557.37s]  Shit.
[557.37s -> 557.97s]  I'm sorry, guys.
[557.97s -> 559.50s]  I didn't sit there.
[559.50s -> 561.50s]  I didn't sit there and put my headphones in
[561.50s -> 562.50s]  and sit there and go...
[564.50s -> 567.84s]  Like what am I doing in here?
[567.84s -> 569.14s]  You need to refund it.
[569.84s -> 571.24s]  Am I too loud?
[571.24s -> 574.78s]  But everybody says I'm too soft.
[574.78s -> 575.88s]  The gain is too high.
[575.88s -> 577.28s]  All right, I'm going to turn the gain down
[577.28s -> 583.23s]  and then we're going to get this right.
[583.23s -> 584.44s]  We'll get it right.
[584.44s -> 586.12s]  Okay, you ready?
[586.12s -> 586.72s]  Boom.
[586.72s -> 587.52s]  How's that?
[587.52s -> 589.06s]  How are we feeling about this one?
[589.06s -> 590.06s]  How do we feel about this?
[590.06s -> 591.90s]  Do we feel pretty good about this?
[591.90s -> 594.95s]  Are we feeling better about this?
[594.95s -> 596.83s]  This is literally perfect right now.
[596.83s -> 599.11s]  Okay, we have to do a test.
[601.41s -> 602.61s]  Oh, I fucking hate that.
[602.61s -> 607.56s]  Get off camera.
[607.56s -> 609.84s]  The laugh is still weird.
[609.84s -> 613.74s]  I think that was a weird laugh, man.
[615.54s -> 618.19s]  Does that sound weird?
[618.19s -> 619.39s]  You have a distortion filter on.
[619.39s -> 620.19s]  I actually, I really don't.
[620.19s -> 622.43s]  I promise, I really don't.
[622.43s -> 623.43s]  It's phasing.
[623.43s -> 625.78s]  Yeah, why is it phasing?
[625.78s -> 627.43s]  Whatever.
[627.43s -> 628.43s]  Look, the game we're playing
[628.43s -> 629.93s]  is wicked fucked up today anyways.
[629.93s -> 635.62s]  So look, just pretend it's part of the VHS filter.
[635.62s -> 636.52s]  Yeah, who gives a shit?
[636.52s -> 638.90s]  Let's go.
[638.90s -> 642.68s]  I'll get it right.
[642.68s -> 645.94s]  It's trying to cut off your weird voices.
[645.94s -> 646.74s]  Why?
[646.74s -> 651.36s]  That's weird.
[651.36s -> 654.16s]  All right, I just came in here to do some settings.
[654.16s -> 655.77s]  Should I turn the filter off?
[655.77s -> 657.27s]  Should I turn the VHS filter off?
[657.27s -> 660.77s]  Or what?
[660.77s -> 667.73s]  I mean, everyone hates this, don't they?
[667.73s -> 669.73s]  Turn it off and lights off too.
[669.83s -> 674.36s]  All the lights are off in my whole house.
[674.36s -> 676.46s]  Just don't laugh or don't make any weird sounds.
[676.46s -> 678.26s]  I'll figure out the weird sound filter
[678.26s -> 681.08s]  that I have for no reason.
[681.08s -> 685.95s]  Your mic thinks your noises are inhuman
[685.95s -> 689.16s]  and is filtering them out.
[689.16s -> 695.04s]  That's so stupid.
[695.04s -> 699.70s]  Whatever, I'm getting caught by a weird noise filter?
[699.70s -> 700.80s]  I don't have a noise gate on.
[700.80s -> 703.80s]  I don't have a compressor on right now either.
[703.80s -> 708.90s]  I think this just hates me.
[708.90s -> 710.30s]  The VHS filter kind of hurts my head.
[710.30s -> 712.97s]  I'll keep the CRT filter on.
[712.97s -> 714.17s]  If anyone has to complain about that,
[714.17s -> 715.17s]  then get in line,
[715.17s -> 718.90s]  because I have a lot of announcements to make today.
[719.00s -> 719.40s]  Hold on, what?
[719.40s -> 720.60s]  I'm not even fucking ready to stream yet.
[720.60s -> 724.75s]  I got a lot of things to talk about.
[724.75s -> 725.55s]  Yeah, I'm not even ready yet.
[725.55s -> 728.39s]  Hold on, give me a second.
[728.39s -> 733.32s]  I have some announcements.
[733.32s -> 734.83s]  Announcement number one.
[734.83s -> 737.69s]  Are you ready?
[737.69s -> 741.31s]  Over the next day or so, next couple of days,
[741.31s -> 743.64s]  we are going to be officially...
[743.64s -> 744.44s]  Officially...
[747.56s -> 748.06s]  Did that sound weird?
[748.06s -> 753.78s]  I just coughed normally.
[753.78s -> 759.35s]  Green screen part three, the finale.
[759.35s -> 763.34s]  The final green screen stream
[763.34s -> 765.98s]  is coming in the next week or two.
[765.98s -> 770.53s]  I'm going back in front of the screen one last time.
[770.53s -> 775.53s]  One final time ever.
[775.53s -> 776.63s]  So what's going to happen is,
[776.63s -> 777.93s]  just like in previous years,
[777.93s -> 782.91s]  in the Discord, you are going to go to the Discord.
[782.91s -> 785.51s]  The channel has to be created and has to be...
[785.51s -> 788.35s]  The rules need to be pinned up and everything.
[788.35s -> 789.95s]  But I need actions.
[789.95s -> 791.95s]  I need things that you want me to do.
[791.95s -> 792.85s]  Just like in previous years,
[792.85s -> 796.35s]  we're going to have people curate a ton of actions.
[796.35s -> 798.75s]  I, myself, am going to go do some things as well.
[798.75s -> 801.62s]  I'm going to make my own actions up.
[801.62s -> 803.62s]  Please do all the Fortnite dances.
[803.62s -> 806.02s]  Well, let me just be very clear.
[806.02s -> 808.93s]  This is the last time this is ever happening.
[808.93s -> 811.03s]  Three times in front of the green screen.
[811.03s -> 811.63s]  There you go.
[811.63s -> 813.78s]  That's it.
[813.78s -> 816.04s]  We'll have the whole trilogy.
[816.04s -> 819.67s]  And I'm going to do a green screen movie night
[819.67s -> 823.94s]  at some point in June.
[823.94s -> 825.14s]  I will tell you the hard date
[825.14s -> 826.54s]  that I'm going to go in front of the screen,
[826.54s -> 829.64s]  but for now, let's just make this really, really...
[829.64s -> 832.34s]  My microphone socks, dude.
[832.34s -> 833.74s]  We'll make this really easy.
[833.74s -> 835.84s]  And just, if you have actions,
[835.84s -> 837.04s]  I would like to see you do this.
[837.04s -> 838.44s]  I would like to see you do this.
[838.44s -> 840.24s]  We're going to have a discussion channel to open up
[840.24s -> 844.81s]  in some ways you guys can figure out what you want me to do.
[844.81s -> 846.59s]  I'll give you more info soon.
[846.59s -> 849.48s]  What's the status on baseball?
[849.48s -> 851.39s]  July 14th?
[851.39s -> 852.69s]  The baseball stream is happening.
[852.69s -> 853.49s]  July 14th?
[853.49s -> 855.19s]  That's all you need to know.
[855.19s -> 857.95s]  I'm not telling you anything else.
[857.95s -> 861.53s]  Please use multiple outfits.
[861.53s -> 862.63s]  Do this, IRL.
[862.63s -> 865.54s]  I just did!
[865.54s -> 867.74s]  Yeah, a lot of Discord users probably covered it right now.
[867.74s -> 868.84s]  I don't think it's there yet.
[868.84s -> 873.50s]  I just want to talk about it now.
[873.50s -> 876.88s]  The second thing I want to talk about is Otto.
[876.88s -> 877.98s]  Otto was doing way better.
[877.98s -> 880.36s]  If you don't, if you missed the past weekend,
[880.36s -> 882.60s]  Otto had a UTI
[882.60s -> 884.60s]  and it was actually really, really awful.
[884.60s -> 886.56s]  Really sad.
[886.56s -> 888.66s]  He was throwing up.
[888.66s -> 893.66s]  He was peeing 10, 20 times in a couple of hours.
[893.66s -> 895.06s]  He was constantly every 5, 10 minutes.
[895.06s -> 895.96s]  I got to go out. I got to go out.
[895.96s -> 897.44s]  I got to go out.
[897.44s -> 900.74s]  It's like, all right, well, let's see what's going on.
[900.74s -> 903.64s]  So I kind of canceled the whole weekend worth of streams
[903.64s -> 907.57s]  and we're picking up this horror stuff I was supposed to do two days ago.
[907.57s -> 912.24s]  But he's been put on an antibiotic and he is way better.
[912.24s -> 913.64s]  I would say he's pretty much back to normal.
[913.64s -> 916.49s]  He is almost 100% normal now.
[916.49s -> 918.29s]  So that's really good too.
[918.29s -> 920.48s]  Really happy about that.
[920.48s -> 922.48s]  The other thing I want to talk about,
[922.48s -> 924.68s]  let's talk about this.
[924.68s -> 928.68s]  The archive channel, the VOD channel,
[928.68s -> 931.08s]  you know, the German archive channel on YouTube
[931.08s -> 933.96s]  that you've come to know and love over the years,
[933.96s -> 938.36s]  is now officially an official channel
[938.36s -> 942.71s]  that has been absorbed into the German network.
[942.71s -> 945.01s]  So that's really, really cool too.
[945.01s -> 946.91s]  If you don't know what I'm talking about,
[946.91s -> 953.32s]  the archive channel has been uploading every stream I've ever done.
[953.32s -> 958.22s]  And I mean, they're dating back to like 2014, 2015.
[958.22s -> 964.36s]  Every single one.
[964.36s -> 965.76s]  You need to upload the...
[965.76s -> 969.06s]  Guys, I don't even have access.
[969.06s -> 972.66s]  Okay, people are like, hey dude, back in like 2013,
[972.66s -> 974.76s]  you did like a stream.
[974.76s -> 976.16s]  You have like access to that stream.
[976.16s -> 977.96s]  Like we kind of want to see it.
[977.96s -> 983.79s]  It's like, bro, I don't even know what computer I uploaded that on.
[983.79s -> 988.15s]  You know, I have no fucking idea.
[988.15s -> 989.85s]  I have no idea.
[989.85s -> 994.65s]  Hey dude, you played like Diablo back in like 2012 on stream on YouTube.
[994.65s -> 997.19s]  You have any like idea where I can find that?
[997.19s -> 998.59s]  I know.
[998.59s -> 1000.79s]  I don't know where that would be.
[1000.79s -> 1015.71s]  I have no fucking idea.
[1015.71s -> 1021.23s]  Only three German channels.
[1021.23s -> 1022.73s]  Hey, back in 2013, you did a stream.
[1022.73s -> 1025.53s]  You have backup of that stream because a lot of us would like to see it.
[1025.53s -> 1027.13s]  I have no fucking idea.
[1027.13s -> 1027.73s]  Because I don't even know.
[1027.73s -> 1029.93s]  I don't remember what even happened at breakfast yesterday.
[1029.93s -> 1032.93s]  You think I remember what like hard drive from 10 years ago
[1032.93s -> 1034.83s]  that I had some stream on it maybe?
[1034.83s -> 1037.93s]  I don't fucking know.
[1037.93s -> 1039.83s]  Can we see the baseball stream in person?
[1039.83s -> 1041.58s]  No.
[1041.58s -> 1055.18s]  No.
[1055.18s -> 1056.38s]  Sag.
[1056.38s -> 1057.68s]  What about baseball merch?
[1057.68s -> 1059.48s]  They will be baseball merch.
[1059.48s -> 1061.45s]  A lot of it.
[1061.45s -> 1064.55s]  And I'm really excited for it because it's going to be.
[1064.55s -> 1065.05s]  Oh man.
[1065.05s -> 1066.83s]  What do the kids say?
[1066.83s -> 1067.83s]  It's going to be.
[1067.83s -> 1071.03s]  Give me some things that the kids say so I can sound fucking cool right now.
[1071.03s -> 1071.73s]  What?
[1071.73s -> 1072.23s]  I'm serious.
[1072.23s -> 1075.93s]  They're going to be some of the best merch you've ever seen in your whole life.
[1075.93s -> 1077.73s]  It's going to be awesome.
[1077.73s -> 1081.01s]  Now, let's add a style right now.
[1081.01s -> 1082.41s]  Bustin'.
[1082.41s -> 1084.40s]  There you go.
[1084.40s -> 1088.07s]  Oh man, you're going to be wanting to take like fucking pictures of this.
[1088.07s -> 1089.07s]  This is going to be so sick.
[1089.07s -> 1091.42s]  Trust me.
[1091.42s -> 1091.92s]  All right.
[1091.92s -> 1095.42s]  I got another thing to talk about because this is something that I wanted to address.
[1095.42s -> 1101.26s]  You probably noticed a few days ago or a week ago now that I VIP'd some new people
[1101.26s -> 1104.76s]  and revoked VIP for all those people.
[1104.76s -> 1106.16s]  Well, some of them.
[1106.16s -> 1108.26s]  And it's a very important reason for that.
[1108.26s -> 1113.26s]  As you know, over the last three years or so, where's mine?
[1113.26s -> 1116.53s]  Precisely what I'm about to talk about.
[1116.53s -> 1120.93s]  So VIP has been in this weird place in the channel for the last three or four years or so
[1120.93s -> 1123.33s]  because I haven't really given it to really anybody.
[1123.33s -> 1126.13s]  I mean, maybe a few times during random streams and whatever,
[1126.13s -> 1129.53s]  but besides the community leader stuff in the Discord,
[1129.53s -> 1131.33s]  I haven't really given it to anybody.
[1131.33s -> 1136.53s]  And what I realized and what I'm going to kind of change my rules here,
[1136.53s -> 1140.49s]  I'm not giving VIP to anybody ever again.
[1140.49s -> 1147.25s]  And there's very few specific reasons why I cannot pick and choose people in this community.
[1147.25s -> 1154.13s]  It seems like if I give VIP to somebody, there might be 10 other people that are disappointed.
[1154.13s -> 1156.43s]  There might be a hundred people that deserve it.
[1156.43s -> 1160.29s]  But how can I possibly do that?
[1160.29s -> 1163.79s]  Since this, I mean, there are 16,000 people here right now.
[1163.79s -> 1168.39s]  Ever since this channel grew two or three times in the last two or three years,
[1168.39s -> 1171.99s]  I cannot reliably pick out even probably a hundred of you that I would be like,
[1171.99s -> 1174.19s]  okay, should I? You've done this.
[1174.19s -> 1175.69s]  You've been around. You've said this.
[1175.69s -> 1177.39s]  You've been like an active member of the...
[1177.39s -> 1179.59s]  There's just too many people I could give it to.
[1179.59s -> 1183.16s]  So no one's going to get it.
[1183.16s -> 1186.36s]  Just no one's going to get VIP anymore.
[1186.36s -> 1191.26s]  Unless you are somebody that I really need to see you,
[1191.26s -> 1196.06s]  but like another streamer or a game dev comes in or whatever, right?
[1196.06s -> 1199.91s]  And I want to see them like in the chat.
[1199.91s -> 1205.09s]  This is communism.
[1205.09s -> 1206.39s]  This is what do you mean communism?
[1206.39s -> 1208.69s]  I'm literally removing it from everybody.
[1208.69s -> 1212.66s]  I'm not giving it to everybody.
[1212.66s -> 1217.34s]  That's not, what are you talking about?
[1217.34s -> 1219.24s]  Durama, communist move.
[1219.24s -> 1222.67s]  Mad, communist.
[1222.67s -> 1228.05s]  Actually, that's not communism.
[1228.05s -> 1230.45s]  I'm about to disturb my microphone.
[1230.45s -> 1233.63s]  Don't get me loud.
[1233.63s -> 1237.16s]  Don't make me distort my microphone.
[1237.16s -> 1239.06s]  No, but in all seriousness, no, it's too hard to pick.
[1239.06s -> 1242.26s]  And I don't want people will get pissed off at each other.
[1242.26s -> 1247.52s]  And I already see the issues of,
[1247.52s -> 1250.62s]  hey, this person got VIP.
[1250.62s -> 1252.30s]  Why didn't I get it?
[1252.30s -> 1254.80s]  Or this person doesn't deserve it for XYZ.
[1254.80s -> 1261.18s]  And it's like, I just don't even want to do it.
[1261.18s -> 1262.38s]  There's too many people to give it to.
[1262.38s -> 1264.68s]  Too many people I could give it to.
[1264.68s -> 1268.70s]  So I'm just not going to give it to anybody.
[1268.70s -> 1274.20s]  You understand?
[1274.20s -> 1278.38s]  No cap, your mic is ass.
[1278.38s -> 1284.11s]  VIP that person for an hour.
[1284.11s -> 1285.91s]  The nuclear option.
[1285.91s -> 1288.41s]  But sometimes you have to do the nuclear option.
[1288.41s -> 1290.95s]  You really do.
[1290.95s -> 1294.15s]  I don't want to have, I don't want to give VIP to five people
[1294.15s -> 1298.25s]  and have five other people then like get mad at those five people
[1298.25s -> 1301.35s]  and cause ripples through the community of people
[1301.35s -> 1303.75s]  that are just pissed off that they don't have it
[1303.75s -> 1306.32s]  or that they don't think somebody deserves it.
[1306.32s -> 1307.72s]  For real.
[1307.72s -> 1310.52s]  I don't want to cause this big pick,
[1310.52s -> 1314.42s]  Jerma's picking favorites and he gave it to this person,
[1314.42s -> 1315.62s]  but not to this person.
[1315.62s -> 1316.52s]  It's a huge problem.
[1316.52s -> 1317.42s]  It really could be.
[1317.42s -> 1321.02s]  And so I don't even want to have it be a problem.
[1321.02s -> 1322.02s]  And this is a horror game night.
[1322.02s -> 1328.76s]  So you should be fucking scared.
[1328.76s -> 1330.16s]  You have a webcam mic on.
[1330.16s -> 1334.38s]  I don't, there's no webcam mic on right now.
[1334.38s -> 1335.38s]  You know how angry,
[1335.38s -> 1341.87s]  you know how angry that just made me what you just said?
[1341.87s -> 1344.27s]  You guys are going to get used to it.
[1344.27s -> 1346.87s]  New things are evil and awful, right?
[1347.77s -> 1349.37s]  Remember when I had the new audio setup
[1349.37s -> 1351.57s]  and everyone told me that like I'm the worst streamer
[1351.57s -> 1353.70s]  on the website.
[1353.70s -> 1355.00s]  I remember looking over at chat
[1355.00s -> 1356.60s]  and people on my other audio setup
[1356.60s -> 1359.10s]  that you've gotten used to over the last two to three years.
[1359.10s -> 1360.00s]  Right?
[1360.20s -> 1362.10s]  Somebody brought like this paragraph.
[1362.10s -> 1363.70s]  I might be making this up.
[1363.70s -> 1364.60s]  I don't know, I could be,
[1364.60s -> 1365.60s]  but like I swear to God,
[1365.60s -> 1367.20s]  I looked over and someone was like, dude,
[1367.20s -> 1369.70s]  like you're like probably the worst fucking Twitch streamer
[1369.70s -> 1371.60s]  like quality wise and professional wise or something.
[1371.60s -> 1374.30s]  And I'm just like, what the, what the hell?
[1379.45s -> 1380.25s]  Let's go.
[1380.25s -> 1381.55s]  Why is this here?
[1381.55s -> 1386.80s]  I don't know, this is a mystery that we need to solve.
[1386.80s -> 1388.10s]  Can you guys help me with this mystery?
[1388.10s -> 1393.10s]  Why is there a chili cheese Frito here on my desk?
[1394.54s -> 1397.91s]  But what, why is this here?
[1397.91s -> 1399.51s]  I'm not gonna eat it, what if it hit the ground?
[1399.51s -> 1403.20s]  Why is it in here?
[1403.20s -> 1405.80s]  The mic censored, fuck, or did you not say it?
[1405.80s -> 1409.82s]  I don't know.
[1409.82s -> 1412.12s]  He saves all his production value for the big streams.
[1412.12s -> 1414.93s]  Thank you, thank you.
[1414.93s -> 1417.46s]  I appreciate that.
[1417.46s -> 1418.56s]  All right, this is blood wash.
[1418.56s -> 1421.71s]  It's a scary game about, I don't know.
[1421.71s -> 1422.61s]  People told me to play this.
[1422.61s -> 1424.81s]  People said, hey dude, play this game and it's scary.
[1424.81s -> 1425.81s]  And I've been sitting here for 30 minutes.
[1425.81s -> 1451.55s]  So what production value?
[1451.55s -> 1461.48s]  So I'll have to say about that.
[1461.48s -> 1462.98s]  How do you not know what I'm doing?
[1462.98s -> 1463.88s]  What a day.
[1463.88s -> 1464.68s]  There's people talking.
[1464.68s -> 1466.88s]  Professor Watt was his usual miserable self
[1466.88s -> 1470.00s]  and that test was a killer.
[1470.00s -> 1479.68s]  Like I can just rocks and.
[1479.68s -> 1480.78s]  Are you fucking kidding me?
[1480.78s -> 1483.31s]  Liam didn't do the laundry or clean.
[1483.31s -> 1485.01s]  I'll have to do a load of laundry.
[1485.01s -> 1485.85s]  What are you?
[1485.85s -> 1487.21s]  I have an interview for a job tomorrow
[1487.21s -> 1490.04s]  and have nothing to wear.
[1490.04s -> 1492.85s]  Those, no, I'm doing the thing.
[1492.85s -> 1505.21s]  I'm doing the thing, that fucking meme.
[1505.21s -> 1508.74s]  Okay, I actually just did it.
[1508.74s -> 1511.74s]  I, whatever, I don't care.
[1511.74s -> 1512.58s]  Let's go.
[1512.58s -> 1513.40s]  I'll gather these clothes up
[1513.40s -> 1515.33s]  and head to the laundry room in the basement.
[1515.33s -> 1518.91s]  I'm going to have to be too upset and tired
[1518.91s -> 1520.01s]  to go through it again.
[1520.11s -> 1521.01s]  Let me pay attention to this
[1521.01s -> 1524.20s]  because this is important.
[1524.20s -> 1525.04s]  I need to pay attention.
[1525.04s -> 1526.50s]  This is a scary game and you're fucking with me.
[1526.50s -> 1530.38s]  Do I turn the volume down on this?
[1530.38s -> 1531.28s]  Do I turn it up or down?
[1531.28s -> 1532.38s]  This is one of those games
[1532.38s -> 1536.09s]  that's going to blow my eardrums out, right?
[1536.09s -> 1537.62s]  I'm scared.
[1537.62s -> 1539.12s]  That's why I'm not scared of the jump scares.
[1539.12s -> 1543.68s]  I'm scared of my ears hurting.
[1543.68s -> 1547.86s]  Okay, haven't had time to unpack yet.
[1547.86s -> 1550.58s]  Not sure when I will.
[1550.58s -> 1562.98s]  He did that on purpose.
[1562.98s -> 1565.86s]  Not really, actually.
[1565.86s -> 1567.56s]  I mean, I got like halfway through it
[1567.56s -> 1569.06s]  and then I realized that I was doing it.
[1569.06s -> 1571.22s]  So I was like, fucking whatever.
[1571.22s -> 1573.70s]  And then I started laughing about it.
[1573.70s -> 1575.28s]  Hold on, I need to see it.
[1576.18s -> 1577.08s]  Well, people were like,
[1577.08s -> 1577.92s]  what do you mean?
[1577.92s -> 1578.74s]  What am I talking about?
[1578.74s -> 1580.77s]  It's so clear what I was pointing at.
[1580.77s -> 1581.61s]  Soy Andy.
[1581.61s -> 1584.11s]  Let me see if I did it on purpose.
[1584.11s -> 1584.95s]  Laundry.
[1584.95s -> 1590.04s]  What are you?
[1590.04s -> 1591.80s]  Those.
[1591.80s -> 1592.64s]  Yeah, okay.
[1592.64s -> 1593.46s]  No, I'm doing the thing.
[1593.46s -> 1594.30s]  I'm doing.
[1594.30s -> 1595.60s]  Okay, at about, so of this clip right here.
[1595.60s -> 1596.94s]  Those.
[1596.94s -> 1600.78s]  At exactly eight seconds when my mouth opens
[1600.78s -> 1603.88s]  and I say those is when I realized
[1603.88s -> 1605.46s]  that this is what I was doing.
[1605.46s -> 1606.36s]  So I just held it.
[1606.36s -> 1607.26s]  I freeze.
[1607.26s -> 1608.10s]  I froze.
[1608.10s -> 1608.92s]  No, I'm doing.
[1608.92s -> 1609.96s]  And that's when it was, you know,
[1609.96s -> 1613.39s]  it could have been on purpose at that point.
[1613.39s -> 1615.21s]  It was not on purpose until about seven
[1615.21s -> 1618.96s]  and a half seconds in that clip.
[1618.96s -> 1620.50s]  I can't play the game before people scream
[1620.50s -> 1626.58s]  at me for being the worst streamer on Twitch again.
[1626.58s -> 1630.62s]  Okay.
[1630.62s -> 1631.64s]  Why do you hate Europeans?
[1631.64s -> 1640.37s]  I live in the fucking America.
[1640.37s -> 1641.71s]  I live in the United States of America
[1641.71s -> 1644.65s]  on the western most coast of the country.
[1644.65s -> 1647.42s]  You and I, when you're eating breakfast, dude,
[1647.42s -> 1648.38s]  I'm just going to bed.
[1648.38s -> 1649.98s]  I'm like getting under the covers
[1649.98s -> 1651.38s]  and like going to sleep when you wake up
[1651.38s -> 1652.72s]  and you eat breakfast.
[1652.72s -> 1655.52s]  When you go to bed, I'm like, oh, waking up.
[1655.52s -> 1658.46s]  It's like fucking 11 o'clock in the morning.
[1658.46s -> 1661.74s]  I live across the world from you.
[1661.74s -> 1665.80s]  I live in the United States of America.
[1665.80s -> 1669.66s]  He hates Europeans.
[1669.66s -> 1670.48s]  All right.
[1670.48s -> 1675.72s]  I need to leave.
[1675.72s -> 1676.72s]  It's 3 a.m. right now.
[1676.72s -> 1678.86s]  Dude, it's four o'clock in the afternoon here
[1678.86s -> 1680.92s]  and I'm at peak happiness.
[1680.92s -> 1684.71s]  So I'm sorry.
[1684.71s -> 1686.11s]  Okay.
[1686.11s -> 1688.64s]  Let's go.
[1688.64s -> 1689.48s]  I can't leave.
[1689.48s -> 1690.32s]  I need to gather my dirty clothes.
[1690.32s -> 1691.14s]  All right.
[1691.14s -> 1696.51s]  Let's get the dirty clothes.
[1696.51s -> 1706.37s]  Pizza, chair, small black and white TV, okay.
[1706.37s -> 1707.19s]  All right.
[1707.19s -> 1710.30s]  How much dirty clothes do I have?
[1710.30s -> 1715.10s]  Dirty clothes and Coke 24 packs.
[1715.10s -> 1717.83s]  Did I get it all?
[1717.83s -> 1718.67s]  Okay.
[1718.67s -> 1719.94s]  I think I got it all.
[1721.85s -> 1725.97s]  What do you mean all my dirty clothes?
[1725.97s -> 1727.09s]  Is that it?
[1727.09s -> 1727.93s]  There we go.
[1727.93s -> 1728.83s]  I think that's all the dirty laundry.
[1728.83s -> 1732.58s]  Time to go to the basement.
[1732.58s -> 1737.63s]  You didn't deny that you hate EU.
[1737.63s -> 1738.67s]  What do you mean I hate EU?
[1738.67s -> 1743.88s]  No, I'm saying I don't hate EU.
[1743.88s -> 1745.21s]  I just said it.
[1745.21s -> 1746.87s]  I said I don't hate EU.
[1746.87s -> 1747.71s]  Why are you making that up?
[1747.71s -> 1751.82s]  What are you trying to make me look bad?
[1751.82s -> 1755.89s]  I'm sorry that our clocks are different right now.
[1755.89s -> 1758.66s]  Where's the basement?
[1758.66s -> 1767.36s]  Oh, okay.
[1767.36s -> 1768.93s]  Wait, what?
[1768.93s -> 1769.97s]  Jerma, keep me entertained
[1769.97s -> 1772.01s]  while my bowels are being cleansed.
[1772.01s -> 1781.13s]  That's from the Dusk Dev.
[1781.13s -> 1783.54s]  I'm gonna try.
[1783.54s -> 1784.38s]  A nice man lives here.
[1784.38s -> 1785.20s]  It's good to know you have
[1785.20s -> 1792.38s]  at least one good neighbor.
[1792.38s -> 1793.59s]  Newspaper.
[1793.59s -> 1794.99s]  Headline reads,
[1794.99s -> 1797.64s]  womb ripper strikes again.
[1797.64s -> 1798.90s]  In the early hours of the 30th,
[1798.90s -> 1800.80s]  authorities were called when a passerby
[1800.80s -> 1802.86s]  found a terribly mangled corpse,
[1802.86s -> 1806.28s]  haphazardly tossed on the nearby grounds.
[1806.28s -> 1808.96s]  Sources indicate that the woman was indeed pregnant.
[1808.96s -> 1810.16s]  And just like previous victims,
[1810.16s -> 1811.76s]  the fetus was cut out and assumed
[1811.76s -> 1814.08s]  to be taken by the assailant.
[1814.08s -> 1815.94s]  This is now the fourth victim in as many weeks,
[1815.94s -> 1817.62s]  and authorities are struggling to come up with leads
[1817.62s -> 1820.08s]  and one of the most gruesome crime sprees
[1820.08s -> 1825.88s]  the city has ever endured.
[1825.88s -> 1826.88s]  The woman and her son live here.
[1826.88s -> 1827.72s]  Now that I think about it,
[1827.72s -> 1837.92s]  I haven't seen either one in about a week.
[1837.92s -> 1840.60s]  Okay.
[1840.60s -> 1842.26s]  Oh, also, you know what's different about this audio setup
[1842.26s -> 1845.25s]  that a bunch of people are gonna be really pissed off about?
[1845.25s -> 1847.34s]  But I'll try to fix it eventually.
[1847.34s -> 1849.02s]  I make a ton of mouth sounds.
[1849.02s -> 1855.00s]  And now, now you can hear them all.
[1855.00s -> 1862.86s]  See, before you couldn't hear any of those.
[1862.86s -> 1863.70s]  See?
[1863.70s -> 1865.79s]  I hate that.
[1865.79s -> 1867.57s]  Okay.
[1867.57s -> 1868.41s]  I don't need to go to that floor
[1868.41s -> 1873.58s]  besides one of the people in that floor has a mean dog.
[1873.58s -> 1876.34s]  All right, we'll make sure we get over this really quick.
[1876.34s -> 1877.50s]  Let's get over this really quick
[1877.50s -> 1878.88s]  because I know that we're gonna see a lot of these.
[1878.88s -> 1881.83s]  So let's just get over this for the next minute or so.
[1881.83s -> 1883.70s]  Let's just get over this.
[1883.70s -> 1884.54s]  Hold on.
[1884.54s -> 1890.64s]  Let me just get over this real quick.
[1890.64s -> 1896.32s]  Let me just get over this.
[1896.32s -> 1897.92s]  Okay.
[1897.92s -> 1899.52s]  This is, we're gonna get over this.
[1899.52s -> 1905.33s]  Just bear with me while we go through these.
[1905.33s -> 1907.32s]  Very nice.
[1907.32s -> 1908.16s]  Yes.
[1908.16s -> 1912.76s]  Absolutely.
[1912.76s -> 1916.82s]  I think that's BB-8 or whatever that character's name is.
[1916.82s -> 1919.48s]  Okay.
[1919.48s -> 1920.32s]  Let's keep them coming.
[1920.32s -> 1925.45s]  We're gonna blow through these.
[1925.45s -> 1927.94s]  Uh-huh.
[1927.94s -> 1929.53s]  Very nice.
[1929.53s -> 1930.53s]  It's a pretty good website.
[1930.53s -> 1933.87s]  If you're looking for news or...
[1933.87s -> 1942.05s]  How did you, what?
[1942.05s -> 1945.97s]  That one's kind of big.
[1945.97s -> 1951.53s]  Uh-huh.
[1952.17s -> 1954.96s]  But why are these so, like, who cares?
[1954.96s -> 1960.84s]  This is like...
[1960.84s -> 1963.30s]  Yeah, I'm sorry, but Las Vegas is fucking cool.
[1963.30s -> 1964.14s]  Okay?
[1964.14s -> 1964.96s]  I'm sorry.
[1964.96s -> 1966.80s]  Me pointing at the Las Vegas sign
[1966.80s -> 1968.64s]  is not me pointing at the Reddit sign
[1968.64s -> 1970.04s]  because Vegas is fucking cool.
[1970.04s -> 1971.28s]  I love this place.
[1971.28s -> 1977.40s]  So, excuse me?
[1977.40s -> 1985.68s]  Somebody made the template, but it's not even...
[1985.68s -> 1986.52s]  Here's the template.
[1986.52s -> 2003.21s]  Should I leave this on the stream?
[2003.21s -> 2011.50s]  So stupid.
[2011.50s -> 2015.74s]  Oh, this is so annoying.
[2015.74s -> 2016.98s]  Wait, I've already done this?
[2016.98s -> 2017.82s]  What do you mean?
[2017.82s -> 2021.44s]  Hold on.
[2021.44s -> 2022.28s]  A classic.
[2022.28s -> 2026.33s]  I did already do this?
[2027.01s -> 2032.25s]  This is from years ago.
[2032.25s -> 2035.32s]  This is the hot air balloon.
[2035.32s -> 2037.84s]  I didn't actually do this, did I?
[2037.84s -> 2040.56s]  I fucking did.
[2040.56s -> 2045.30s]  This is before anybody even gave a shit about this.
[2045.30s -> 2047.81s]  This actually was from, like, four years ago
[2047.81s -> 2051.43s]  before that meme, anyone even cared.
[2051.43s -> 2054.22s]  Oh my God, I look like shit.
[2054.22s -> 2055.06s]  I look tired.
[2055.06s -> 2056.80s]  What's wrong with my eyes?
[2056.80s -> 2061.39s]  Why do I look so fucking disheveled?
[2061.39s -> 2063.60s]  Okay.
[2063.60s -> 2064.64s]  This one, we'll just put this one up
[2064.64s -> 2065.48s]  and then I'm gonna move on.
[2065.48s -> 2066.48s]  I'm gonna play the horror game
[2066.48s -> 2068.68s]  that I'm supposed to be playing.
[2068.68s -> 2070.00s]  You know, why not show this one too?
[2070.00s -> 2075.38s]  This is gonna be a favorite, I think.
[2075.42s -> 2080.92s]  You look like a newly discovered fish.
[2080.92s -> 2090.93s]  All right, dude.
[2090.93s -> 2092.78s]  That was fun.
[2092.78s -> 2095.78s]  Let's play the video game.
[2095.78s -> 2098.97s]  Do I have audio?
[2098.97s -> 2100.29s]  All right.
[2100.29s -> 2106.24s]  You look like a taxidermy fish.
[2106.24s -> 2111.67s]  What do you look like at eight o'clock in the morning?
[2111.67s -> 2112.51s]  Oh, that's loud.
[2112.51s -> 2113.33s]  That's very loud.
[2113.33s -> 2114.66s]  It hurts.
[2114.66s -> 2120.08s]  I get a...
[2120.08s -> 2121.20s]  All right, this is the last one I'm gonna show.
[2121.20s -> 2143.84s]  I promise.
[2143.84s -> 2154.08s]  Nice zit.
[2154.08s -> 2155.16s]  An old tire.
[2155.16s -> 2156.96s]  Actually, I don't like the CRT filter.
[2156.96s -> 2164.71s]  It kind of makes me wanna throw up.
[2164.71s -> 2168.02s]  Out of order?
[2168.02s -> 2168.84s]  Turn it off.
[2168.84s -> 2184.06s]  Yeah, it kind of makes me wanna puke.
[2184.06s -> 2188.66s]  It's worse.
[2188.66s -> 2193.77s]  It smells like it hasn't been taken out in months.
[2193.81s -> 2194.79s]  Out of order?
[2194.79s -> 2195.81s]  What am I gonna do now?
[2195.81s -> 2198.16s]  I should probably go back upstairs and figure something out.
[2198.16s -> 2201.61s]  Turn the headbomb off.
[2201.61s -> 2213.19s]  I think I heard something coming from the closet.
[2213.19s -> 2214.57s]  I think I need to keep it on.
[2214.57s -> 2216.48s]  I think it's designed to have it on.
[2216.48s -> 2219.03s]  It looks weird now.
[2219.03s -> 2223.83s]  Yeah, it somehow looks worse the other way.
[2223.83s -> 2232.88s]  What do you mean from the closet?
[2232.88s -> 2240.91s]  Oh, that hurts.
[2240.91s -> 2247.58s]  I don't need to go through there.
[2247.58s -> 2248.42s]  Loud, by the way.
[2248.42s -> 2249.26s]  It's probably gonna be loud.
[2249.26s -> 2253.64s]  Somebody's probably gonna jump in front of the screen.
[2253.64s -> 2254.92s]  Go back.
[2254.92s -> 2256.90s]  You ignored this jump scare.
[2256.90s -> 2260.92s]  What?
[2260.92s -> 2281.40s]  What are you talking about?
[2281.40s -> 2285.48s]  Let's see what's inside.
[2285.48s -> 2287.49s]  This one's empty.
[2287.49s -> 2293.93s]  Filled with porno.
[2294.01s -> 2294.85s]  What are you talking about?
[2294.85s -> 2297.47s]  The closet?
[2297.47s -> 2299.82s]  What closet?
[2299.82s -> 2326.24s]  This is a filing cabinet.
[2326.24s -> 2327.16s]  That's a tuba reaction.
[2327.16s -> 2329.76s]  I kinda feel like a cartoon.
[2329.76s -> 2330.72s]  It was a tuba reaction.
[2330.72s -> 2341.97s]  I did not expect, whatever.
[2341.97s -> 2344.46s]  Damn girl, you scared the big Jesus out of me.
[2344.46s -> 2347.02s]  God damn girl, you scared the big Jesus out of me.
[2347.02s -> 2347.86s]  I scared you?
[2347.86s -> 2352.83s]  You scared me.
[2352.83s -> 2356.00s]  Goku.
[2356.00s -> 2357.38s]  I'm sorry for scaring you.
[2357.38s -> 2359.74s]  I'll tell you, but can you keep this to yourself?
[2359.74s -> 2360.80s]  I love this acting.
[2360.80s -> 2361.74s]  I love this actor.
[2361.74s -> 2362.58s]  This is great.
[2362.58s -> 2363.60s]  This is actually, I love this.
[2363.60s -> 2366.80s]  Jesus Christ, Joe, you're insane.
[2366.80s -> 2367.84s]  Yeah, I can.
[2367.84s -> 2369.08s]  What's up?
[2369.28s -> 2371.80s]  The missus kicked me out and it's too cold outside,
[2371.80s -> 2374.24s]  so I'm trying to wait her out down here.
[2374.24s -> 2375.88s]  I really didn't mean to creep argue.
[2375.88s -> 2382.52s]  Honest.
[2382.52s -> 2384.75s]  This is never gonna end, is it?
[2384.75s -> 2386.19s]  This is never gonna end.
[2386.19s -> 2387.03s]  This is what happens.
[2387.03s -> 2387.87s]  I just can't stop.
[2387.87s -> 2395.89s]  I cannot stop this.
[2395.89s -> 2398.01s]  But I need to show them, right?
[2398.01s -> 2404.74s]  It's my obligation to.
[2404.74s -> 2405.58s]  I believe you.
[2405.58s -> 2407.70s]  Just next time, maybe don't go around
[2407.70s -> 2411.04s]  slinging doors open and hiding in the dark.
[2411.04s -> 2411.92s]  I will.
[2411.92s -> 2413.08s]  Thanks, kid.
[2413.08s -> 2415.36s]  Say, if you're wanting to use the washing machine,
[2415.36s -> 2416.76s]  it's broken.
[2416.76s -> 2417.80s]  Yeah, thanks.
[2418.72s -> 2420.69s]  I figured that out.
[2420.69s -> 2425.30s]  Okay, thanks a lot.
[2425.30s -> 2426.46s]  I thought you guys were full of shit
[2426.46s -> 2427.98s]  that I missed the jump scare.
[2427.98s -> 2430.22s]  I thought, like, go check the closet.
[2430.22s -> 2432.34s]  I thought it was this.
[2432.34s -> 2439.00s]  I did not know the door was gonna rip open.
[2439.00s -> 2439.92s]  That was very scary.
[2439.92s -> 2441.76s]  It was probably loud.
[2441.76s -> 2442.76s]  Just, it's gonna be loud.
[2442.76s -> 2445.02s]  Just, please be aware of that.
[2445.02s -> 2446.14s]  They're gonna hear it.
[2450.81s -> 2452.17s]  Oh, fuck, I don't have a noise gate anymore.
[2452.17s -> 2456.89s]  You definitely heard that, without a doubt.
[2456.89s -> 2460.21s]  Oh, well.
[2460.21s -> 2461.29s]  Fuck.
[2461.29s -> 2466.88s]  This is why I can't, wait, forget what I just did.
[2466.88s -> 2468.65s]  What's up, sir?
[2468.65s -> 2471.85s]  Oh, you know, trying to balance life, school, and job hunting.
[2471.85s -> 2474.09s]  It's a tough world these days.
[2474.09s -> 2475.69s]  Liam been treating you well.
[2475.69s -> 2479.70s]  When he isn't drunk, yeah.
[2479.70s -> 2482.93s]  You'll tell me if it gets bad, yeah?
[2482.93s -> 2483.85s]  This is my neighbor.
[2483.85s -> 2486.14s]  I know it ain't easy to talk about.
[2486.14s -> 2488.17s]  And you don't have to tell me nothing.
[2488.17s -> 2491.01s]  Just promise me you'll tell me if you need help.
[2491.01s -> 2493.37s]  My sister used to be in a bad situation, too.
[2493.37s -> 2494.93s]  And there's places you can go.
[2494.93s -> 2496.65s]  I appreciate that, Stan.
[2496.65s -> 2497.69s]  I really do.
[2497.69s -> 2498.93s]  Yeah, sure.
[2498.93s -> 2501.17s]  You doing some laundry at this time of night?
[2501.17s -> 2502.90s]  I'm trying to.
[2502.90s -> 2504.10s]  Of course, when I really need it,
[2504.10s -> 2506.26s]  the washer downstairs is broken.
[2506.26s -> 2507.90s]  Ain't that some shit?
[2507.90s -> 2509.04s]  Yeah.
[2509.04s -> 2511.16s]  And speaking of shit, I have an interview tomorrow,
[2511.16s -> 2514.37s]  so I guess I'll show up smelling like crap.
[2514.37s -> 2515.21s]  Jesus.
[2515.21s -> 2516.29s]  Well, if it's an emergency,
[2516.29s -> 2519.13s]  I heard of this laundromat that's open 24-7,
[2519.13s -> 2520.41s]  just outside of town.
[2520.41s -> 2522.76s]  Still early enough to catch the last bus.
[2522.76s -> 2524.76s]  24-7, outside of town.
[2524.76s -> 2526.60s]  I'll have to say, though,
[2526.60s -> 2529.20s]  it's a hell of a time to be out so late,
[2529.20s -> 2533.93s]  especially with that maniac roaming around.
[2533.97s -> 2537.08s]  I mean, if I needed to do laundry and I couldn't,
[2537.08s -> 2539.40s]  I'd probably just turn the sink on
[2539.40s -> 2541.00s]  and just put a bunch of soap in the sink
[2541.00s -> 2544.28s]  and plug the hole so the sink will fill up
[2544.28s -> 2545.12s]  and just like...
[2545.12s -> 2547.76s]  Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug.
[2547.76s -> 2551.87s]  And then just kind of hang it over the shower curtain
[2551.87s -> 2555.36s]  and just let it dry.
[2555.36s -> 2557.26s]  I'm a big girl, Stan.
[2557.26s -> 2559.60s]  Do you know the address?
[2559.60s -> 2560.72s]  Sure, sure.
[2560.72s -> 2561.96s]  Let me write it down for you.
[2561.96s -> 2562.80s]  1800s laundry?
[2562.80s -> 2564.76s]  Promise me you'll take care, all right?
[2564.76s -> 2567.79s]  I mean, if you just need one, you know,
[2567.79s -> 2570.71s]  a shirt, a pair of pants,
[2570.75s -> 2571.83s]  maybe another shirt or something.
[2571.83s -> 2572.75s]  Yeah, I would just do it in the,
[2572.75s -> 2574.03s]  I would just turn the shower on and just,
[2574.03s -> 2575.43s]  I would just put the clothes on
[2575.43s -> 2576.27s]  and just get in the shower
[2576.27s -> 2578.61s]  and take a shower with the clothes on
[2578.61s -> 2591.36s]  and then just take them off and just air dry them.
[2591.36s -> 2593.99s]  That's how, why is that weird?
[2593.99s -> 2597.19s]  Is that really that weird to like wash your clothes
[2597.19s -> 2599.19s]  if you're in like an emergency situation
[2599.19s -> 2601.39s]  where your laundry machine doesn't work
[2601.39s -> 2606.65s]  or to just wash your fucking clothes in the sink?
[2606.65s -> 2611.54s]  Why is that such a weird take?
[2611.54s -> 2613.28s]  It's warm water and soap.
[2613.28s -> 2616.23s]  What do you think happens in the washing machine?
[2616.23s -> 2617.77s]  Do you think there's like a magical elf
[2617.89s -> 2619.09s]  that when you turn the washing machine on
[2619.09s -> 2623.14s]  that takes your clothes to someplace to clean them,
[2623.14s -> 2625.14s]  it's just soap and water and it just goes.
[2625.14s -> 2636.39s]  doesn't do anything else while wearing them?
[2636.39s -> 2639.67s]  Well, you could like probably save water.
[2639.67s -> 2651.15s]  You take a shower and clean the clothes at the same time.
[2651.15s -> 2652.35s]  So now I just gotta get ready
[2652.35s -> 2659.38s]  to go to the laundromat, I think, right?
[2659.38s -> 2669.73s]  I thought it was a clock, thought it was a health pack.
[2669.73s -> 2671.17s]  All right, I'm ready to go.
[2671.17s -> 2678.12s]  I got my clothes, I'm ready to move out.
[2678.12s -> 2680.04s]  Hurry, you might be able to catch the next bus.
[2680.04s -> 2693.61s]  Thanks again, Stan.
[2693.61s -> 2694.45s]  Do I have to go all the way down
[2694.45s -> 2695.78s]  or just out this front door?
[2695.78s -> 2697.12s]  I'm on the second floor right now, okay.
[2697.12s -> 2699.67s]  Second floor.
[2699.67s -> 2701.56s]  I need to get my purse first.
[2701.56s -> 2710.77s]  What?
[2710.77s -> 2713.27s]  Dan's the murderer.
[2713.27s -> 2714.11s]  Don't you dare.
[2714.11s -> 2719.07s]  It just, okay, if that's a spoiler, you're in deep shit.
[2719.07s -> 2723.71s]  You're in deep shit.
[2723.71s -> 2726.09s]  That person's in deep shit.
[2726.09s -> 2733.87s]  All right, where's my purse?
[2733.87s -> 2735.37s]  Where's my purse?
[2735.37s -> 2736.84s]  Oh, there it is.
[2736.84s -> 2738.24s]  You can backseat me.
[2738.24s -> 2739.36s]  You can call me an idiot.
[2739.36s -> 2740.52s]  You can call me stupid.
[2740.52s -> 2742.76s]  But the second that you put what happens
[2742.76s -> 2745.96s]  at the end of end game in the chat here,
[2745.96s -> 2749.29s]  I don't think so.
[2749.29s -> 2755.36s]  All right, let's do it.
[2755.36s -> 2757.45s]  Goodbye.
[2757.45s -> 2761.80s]  I gotta, this image is just on my other monitor.
[2761.80s -> 2765.62s]  I'm gonna add this as Jerma Chest to BTTV.
[2765.62s -> 2768.10s]  Whatever, that's fine.
[2768.10s -> 2773.85s]  That's fine.
[2773.85s -> 2778.77s]  That's fine.
[2778.77s -> 2780.79s]  Ugh.
[2780.79s -> 2783.29s]  All right, can I turn the audio down?
[2783.29s -> 2784.49s]  Is it really gonna be that loud?
[2784.49s -> 2786.16s]  Like, I don't like that.
[2786.16s -> 2787.52s]  I don't like this.
[2787.52s -> 2789.14s]  I don't like how loud the sounds are.
[2789.14s -> 2793.97s]  There's a person right here.
[2793.97s -> 2795.43s]  Hi there.
[2795.43s -> 2796.51s]  Are you okay?
[2796.51s -> 2798.29s]  Can I get you anything?
[2798.29s -> 2800.00s]  It's gone.
[2800.00s -> 2801.89s]  They took it.
[2801.89s -> 2804.90s]  Did someone steal something from you?
[2804.90s -> 2805.74s]  They took it.
[2805.74s -> 2809.46s]  The people in the walls, they took it from me.
[2809.46s -> 2812.28s]  Oh God, she's here now.
[2812.28s -> 2814.12s]  I should probably leave him alone.
[2814.12s -> 2820.60s]  Poor guy.
[2820.60s -> 2828.21s]  Jesus.
[2828.21s -> 2851.10s]  Bus stop.
[2851.10s -> 2851.94s]  What?
[2851.94s -> 2857.67s]  What are you doing?
[2857.67s -> 2858.49s]  Run?
[2858.49s -> 2859.33s]  Is that the bus?
[2859.33s -> 2864.76s]  That's not the bus?
[2864.76s -> 2880.80s]  That'd be a really weird bus.
[2880.80s -> 2882.33s]  Got any change?
[2882.33s -> 2884.93s]  Sure, I have a couple dollars.
[2884.93s -> 2886.01s]  Better than nothing.
[2886.01s -> 2887.13s]  Thanks, kid.
[2887.13s -> 2889.39s]  Haven't seen you around here before.
[2889.39s -> 2891.37s]  I moved in not too long ago.
[2891.37s -> 2892.89s]  I'm usually studying or at my classes.
[2892.89s -> 2893.73s]  It's your Uber.
[2893.73s -> 2895.01s]  So that's probably why.
[2895.01s -> 2896.92s]  What was that?
[2896.92s -> 2899.31s]  Oh, a college girl, huh?
[2899.33s -> 2901.84s]  What are you studying?
[2901.84s -> 2904.78s]  I'm pursuing a career in education at the moment.
[2904.78s -> 2907.98s]  Nice, that's what I got my bachelor's in.
[2907.98s -> 2911.56s]  Oh, that's great.
[2911.56s -> 2914.08s]  I hope I can find a gig soon afterwards.
[2914.08s -> 2920.85s]  If not, my sleeping bag has room for two.
[2920.85s -> 2923.90s]  Anything in the dumpster?
[2923.90s -> 2929.71s]  Oh, there's the bus.
[2929.71s -> 2934.95s]  How do I get on?
[2934.95s -> 2937.23s]  Where are you heading at this hour?
[2937.23s -> 2939.81s]  If you don't mind me asking.
[2939.81s -> 2946.38s]  The laundromat on the outside of town.
[2946.38s -> 2948.26s]  Not sure I believe that.
[2948.26s -> 2950.68s]  Pretty late to be doing laundry.
[2950.68s -> 2952.52s]  Hey, if you're looking to score,
[2952.52s -> 2956.44s]  I have a good deal just for a pretty little thing like you.
[2956.44s -> 2957.88s]  Oh, fucking leave me alone.
[2957.88s -> 2959.72s]  You won't even have to pay cash if you know what I mean.
[2959.72s -> 2961.16s]  How about you just drive the bus
[2961.16s -> 2963.16s]  and I'll pretend you're not a desperate loser.
[2963.16s -> 2965.06s]  Whatever, bitch.
[2965.06s -> 2967.40s]  Sit the fuck down so I can get this piece
[2967.40s -> 2971.13s]  of junk rolling again.
[2971.13s -> 2972.91s]  What the fuck?
[2972.91s -> 2975.15s]  Dirty seat, dirty seat, dirty seat,
[2975.15s -> 2976.69s]  dirty seat, dirty seat.
[2986.13s -> 2988.25s]  Well, I guess I'm gonna sit here.
[2988.25s -> 2989.43s]  It's gonna be fucking loud.
[2989.43s -> 2999.77s]  Should I turn it down?
[2999.77s -> 3020.15s]  Turn it down.
[3020.15s -> 3027.89s]  Turn it up.
[3027.89s -> 3028.89s]  I was gonna say, excuse me,
[3028.89s -> 3030.58s]  when does the bus leave?
[3030.58s -> 3032.14s]  There was a, I looked online
[3032.14s -> 3043.76s]  and said the schedule was at 12.15 and it's 12.18.
[3043.76s -> 3051.48s]  Turn the FOV down.
[3051.48s -> 3052.64s]  What are you doing?
[3052.64s -> 3056.38s]  Sit down in a seat.
[3056.38s -> 3065.53s]  Why are you still, okay, that's fucking.
[3065.53s -> 3070.18s]  Sit down in a seat.
[3070.18s -> 3072.38s]  All right, dude, like seriously, sit down.
[3072.38s -> 3074.22s]  This is, no fucking way.
[3074.22s -> 3075.22s]  This is no way.
[3075.22s -> 3078.56s]  This guy right now would be going like this,
[3078.56s -> 3081.16s]  flanning his right foot and stuffing it on the ground
[3081.42s -> 3087.13s]  desperately trying to not fall down.
[3087.13s -> 3088.61s]  You don't have to do that, by the way.
[3088.61s -> 3091.01s]  I know that when some of you guys get on the train
[3091.01s -> 3092.69s]  or on the bus or whatever,
[3092.69s -> 3100.94s]  or whatever, you just grab onto it.
[3100.94s -> 3102.80s]  Dude, I fucking hate this guy.
[3102.80s -> 3110.99s]  He's just weird and he's right next to me.
[3110.99s -> 3113.43s]  How many of you guys have done that shuffle
[3113.43s -> 3114.93s]  where you just plant your foot
[3114.93s -> 3116.85s]  and you don't want to grab onto anything
[3116.85s -> 3117.77s]  because it's like, well, I know,
[3117.77s -> 3120.13s]  I can't grab onto the pole.
[3120.13s -> 3121.88s]  I can handle it.
[3121.88s -> 3124.16s]  Then you go, ooh.
[3126.04s -> 3126.88s]  And then everybody looks at you
[3127.70s -> 3128.98s]  and they're like, fucking idiot.
[3128.98s -> 3134.98s]  Should have just held onto the pole.
[3134.98s -> 3140.62s]  All right, I don't want.
[3140.62s -> 3148.08s]  This person's freaking me out.
[3148.08s -> 3149.42s]  I did that as a kid.
[3151.52s -> 3154.20s]  Look out the window.
[3154.20s -> 3158.13s]  It's so dark, I can't even see the street.
[3158.13s -> 3160.21s]  I knew he was going to do that.
[3160.21s -> 3161.29s]  I was ready for it.
[3161.29s -> 3163.59s]  I was like, oh dude, look out the window, okay.
[3167.55s -> 3169.07s]  I fucking knew that was going to happen.
[3169.07s -> 3169.89s]  I knew it.
[3169.89s -> 3172.23s]  I was waiting for it for the whole time he was on the bus.
[3172.23s -> 3176.22s]  May I sit beside you?
[3176.22s -> 3177.42s]  There's plenty of other seats,
[3178.08s -> 3182.65s]  so I don't see why you would need to do that.
[3182.65s -> 3188.29s]  May I, may I sit beside you?
[3188.29s -> 3190.93s]  Are you deaf?
[3190.93s -> 3193.69s]  Do I need to get the driver to throw you off?
[3193.69s -> 3199.67s]  You're going to die tonight.
[3199.67s -> 3201.00s]  What?
[3201.00s -> 3203.68s]  You're going to die tonight.
[3203.68s -> 3205.24s]  I've seen it.
[3205.24s -> 3208.56s]  Tonight is your last night on earth.
[3208.56s -> 3211.80s]  You are walking straight into your doom.
[3211.80s -> 3213.78s]  Can't you see that?
[3213.78s -> 3216.28s]  You and that child inside you.
[3218.50s -> 3220.10s]  How did you?
[3220.10s -> 3225.10s]  You will be found just like all the others.
[3225.58s -> 3228.34s]  Ripped open, your insides displayed
[3228.34s -> 3231.94s]  for all the angels above to look down and see.
[3233.04s -> 3237.18s]  Oh yes, of that I am certain.
[3237.18s -> 3239.26s]  Please just stop talking.
[3239.26s -> 3241.78s]  May I sit beside you?
[3241.78s -> 3246.91s]  All right miss, this is your stop.
[3246.91s -> 3251.11s]  I mean, so where you put the fucking,
[3251.13s -> 3253.05s]  just fucking grab him by the neck.
[3253.05s -> 3253.89s]  Just grab him.
[3253.89s -> 3256.09s]  Just fucking go bang into the back of the over here
[3256.09s -> 3257.81s]  and be like, what are you threatening me?
[3257.81s -> 3265.92s]  What's how we tell what's happening here?
[3265.92s -> 3278.16s]  Get his ass.
[3278.16s -> 3280.54s]  Yeah, you mean it's something like, I don't know, man.
[3280.54s -> 3285.16s]  I'm just like, you kind of be like, oh, what's,
[3285.16s -> 3286.00s]  let's go.
[3286.00s -> 3286.82s]  You know what I mean?
[3286.82s -> 3290.98s]  Like go.
[3290.98s -> 3291.82s]  Like, what's that?
[3291.82s -> 3303.92s]  There's lights or something, grab.
[3303.92s -> 3306.10s]  No noise gate, so loud.
[3306.10s -> 3319.06s]  I told you.
[3319.06s -> 3326.08s]  It's not that bad.
[3326.08s -> 3339.64s]  That guy was fucking scary.
[3339.66s -> 3342.62s]  I'm scared, please turn it off.
[3342.62s -> 3347.28s]  This is what we're here for.
[3347.28s -> 3349.84s]  Good job, you completed the tutorial in one hour.
[3349.84s -> 3353.33s]  No, don't be a liar.
[3353.33s -> 3354.75s]  Don't be a liar.
[3354.75s -> 3356.72s]  That's what you're doing, you're lying.
[3356.72s -> 3358.12s]  The first 30 minutes of the stream
[3358.12s -> 3359.68s]  was me talking about announcements,
[3359.68s -> 3362.24s]  talking about some changes that I'm gonna be making.
[3362.24s -> 3363.72s]  We sat there for about 30 minutes.
[3363.72s -> 3365.88s]  Then I did the soy face thing.
[3365.88s -> 3367.36s]  That was about 15 minutes.
[3367.36s -> 3369.16s]  So no, that's you being a liar
[3369.16s -> 3371.88s]  and I don't appreciate that very much.
[3371.88s -> 3375.12s]  It's been about 15 to 16 minutes
[3375.14s -> 3399.82s]  of actual in-game video game time.
[3399.82s -> 3410.18s]  Laundromat.
[3410.18s -> 3411.86s]  Yes, what is it?
[3411.86s -> 3416.35s]  Oh, are you all really open all night?
[3416.35s -> 3419.16s]  We're open all night, but I take my naps at midnight.
[3419.16s -> 3421.80s]  So you better not need anything after that.
[3421.80s -> 3423.48s]  Oh, okay.
[3423.48s -> 3425.88s]  I'll be sure not to need anything.
[3425.88s -> 3429.83s]  Yeah, we'll see.
[3429.83s -> 3431.55s]  Need a game toy here?
[3431.55s -> 3435.37s]  Press tab to equip and un-equip your inventory.
[3435.37s -> 3436.45s]  I'll bring it back before I leave.
[3436.45s -> 3440.14s]  It'll be a long night, so I might need it.
[3440.14s -> 3441.96s]  Game toy, can I play it?
[3441.96s -> 3442.80s]  Whoa, okay.
[3442.82s -> 3445.64s]  All right, all right, all right, all right, all right.
[3445.64s -> 3446.92s]  Fork sees revenge.
[3446.92s -> 3452.34s]  Left mouse button to start the game.
[3452.34s -> 3457.24s]  What do I do?
[3457.24s -> 3458.88s]  How do I, what do I do?
[3458.88s -> 3462.70s]  How do I control the game?
[3462.70s -> 3470.28s]  What the fuck, did I just kill somebody?
[3470.28s -> 3476.26s]  Am I doing this right?
[3476.26s -> 3478.82s]  Am I doing this right?
[3478.82s -> 3486.44s]  Should I not be doing that?
[3486.44s -> 3487.40s]  Should I not be doing that?
[3487.40s -> 3488.56s]  All right, what if I avoid?
[3488.56s -> 3490.10s]  I can't, I have to.
[3490.10s -> 3498.91s]  Score one.
[3498.91s -> 3505.73s]  Okay, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it.
[3505.73s -> 3508.92s]  How do I win?
[3508.92s -> 3520.15s]  All right, I gotta pay attention to the screen.
[3521.01s -> 3531.12s]  What do I need to win?
[3531.12s -> 3532.84s]  The song is really good.
[3532.84s -> 3537.14s]  Yeah, it's a pretty good song.
[3537.14s -> 3538.54s]  Oh, I'm done.
[3538.54s -> 3539.38s]  That's stupid.
[3540.42s -> 3544.11s]  All right, do I actually have to do this?
[3544.11s -> 3555.33s]  You have to get to 100.
[3555.33s -> 3556.63s]  Okay, get that out of here.
[3556.63s -> 3558.97s]  All right, so I'm just gonna do my laundry.
[3558.97s -> 3560.29s]  Which one should I use?
[3560.29s -> 3561.80s]  Those are dryers.
[3561.80s -> 3563.53s]  Soap dispenser.
[3563.53s -> 3567.60s]  Brought my own soap.
[3567.60s -> 3571.35s]  Laundry cot.
[3571.35s -> 3576.14s]  Coffee.
[3576.14s -> 3576.98s]  A patron.
[3582.18s -> 3584.04s]  Laundry down the road.
[3584.04s -> 3587.24s]  This place is the only one open when I get off work.
[3587.24s -> 3590.60s]  Was a real pain when the first one burnt down.
[3590.60s -> 3592.40s]  First one?
[3592.40s -> 3594.00s]  You knew around here?
[3594.00s -> 3597.68s]  Yeah, this place used to be next door years ago.
[3597.68s -> 3599.96s]  But there was a big fire.
[3599.96s -> 3603.16s]  I don't think they ever found out exactly what caused it.
[3603.16s -> 3604.44s]  That sounds awful.
[3605.97s -> 3608.77s]  Girl died in that fire too.
[3608.77s -> 3610.41s]  An employee.
[3610.41s -> 3613.37s]  I don't like to spread rumors, but.
[3614.23s -> 3616.63s]  Pretty mysterious.
[3616.63s -> 3618.63s]  The way she died, I mean.
[3618.63s -> 3621.15s]  It wasn't a fire that started quickly.
[3621.15s -> 3623.99s]  She should have had plenty of time to get out.
[3623.99s -> 3626.19s]  But she was found in the office.
[3626.19s -> 3629.34s]  It was me that died in the fire.
[3629.34s -> 3632.40s]  This is like a whole weird Silent Hill type thing
[3632.40s -> 3636.22s]  where it's me that died in the fire.
[3636.22s -> 3638.02s]  I heard they were close to opening up
[3638.02s -> 3639.54s]  a murder investigation.
[3639.54s -> 3640.38s]  Right.
[3640.38s -> 3644.16s]  That a detective thought the girl was locked in.
[3644.16s -> 3645.00s]  Could be.
[3645.00s -> 3648.54s]  She decided to drop it when nobody came up.
[3648.54s -> 3649.94s]  You know, cops.
[3649.94s -> 3652.88s]  Lazy sons of bitches.
[3652.88s -> 3655.70s]  As a fellow writer, you know, you can,
[3655.70s -> 3658.10s]  as a fellow writer, when you start to see
[3658.10s -> 3661.24s]  the pieces come together in the intro
[3661.24s -> 3663.08s]  or what could be the outro,
[3663.08s -> 3665.80s]  I can kind of see it from a pretty long way away.
[3665.80s -> 3667.08s]  As a fellow writer, of course.
[3667.08s -> 3674.42s]  Well, if that's true, it does sound pretty suspect.
[3674.42s -> 3676.30s]  Sure does.
[3676.30s -> 3679.42s]  Feels like it got swept under the rug pretty quick.
[3679.42s -> 3681.12s]  What with the womb ripper coming around
[3681.12s -> 3683.43s]  and butchering those women.
[3683.43s -> 3689.36s]  That has all the headlines these days.
[3689.36s -> 3690.60s]  Okay.
[3690.60s -> 3693.83s]  So, all right.
[3693.83s -> 3696.44s]  So let me just do my laundry.
[3696.44s -> 3730.93s]  Pick up urban legends one.
[3730.93s -> 3731.77s]  All right.
[3731.77s -> 3732.59s]  That was pretty good.
[3732.59s -> 3735.09s]  What happened though?
[3735.09s -> 3742.35s]  I couldn't really tell.
[3742.35s -> 3743.71s]  Yes, what is it?
[3743.71s -> 3745.15s]  Oh, um.
[3745.15s -> 3745.99s]  We're up on.
[3745.99s -> 3746.83s]  Oh yeah.
[3746.83s -> 3751.56s]  So how do I do laundry?
[3751.56s -> 3754.16s]  Dryers, washers.
[3754.16s -> 3755.00s]  Okay.
[3755.00s -> 3756.83s]  Where do I, how do I use one?
[3756.83s -> 3762.21s]  Washers, washers, washers.
[3762.27s -> 3763.11s]  Oh, okay.
[3763.11s -> 3764.26s]  This one's up.
[3764.26s -> 3774.66s]  I need to get some change first.
[3774.66s -> 3775.50s]  Where's the change?
[3775.50s -> 3781.62s]  Change machine?
[3781.62s -> 3783.52s]  What do I make change?
[3783.52s -> 3784.36s]  What do I make change?
[3784.36s -> 3785.20s]  Yes, what is.
[3785.20s -> 3786.04s]  Oh, um.
[3786.04s -> 3786.88s]  We're up.
[3786.88s -> 3787.72s]  Oh yeah.
[3787.72s -> 3793.00s]  Where do I make change?
[3793.00s -> 3797.25s]  The vending machine?
[3797.25s -> 3799.57s]  Isn't there usually a thing to do it with?
[3799.57s -> 3802.67s]  Where is it?
[3802.67s -> 3803.51s]  Magazines.
[3803.51s -> 3808.02s]  Where's the change machine?
[3808.02s -> 3812.98s]  You put the dollar in and you get the arcade tokens.
[3812.98s -> 3816.09s]  You need to look in your purse.
[3816.09s -> 3820.32s]  Explore, you stooge.
[3820.32s -> 3821.78s]  I still fucking so pissed off
[3821.78s -> 3824.62s]  that they're not in Fortnite.
[3824.62s -> 3825.46s]  Yeah.
[3825.84s -> 3828.64s]  The other day they added to Fortnite in the last two weeks.
[3828.64s -> 3830.92s]  And you tell me that the three stooges
[3830.92s -> 3832.32s]  could not have been a possibility.
[3832.32s -> 3834.83s]  Please.
[3834.83s -> 3836.71s]  In fact, it's gonna, it's going to fucking happen.
[3836.71s -> 3838.23s]  It will happen.
[3838.23s -> 3845.34s]  It's just not gonna happen on our timetable.
[3845.34s -> 3857.14s]  Aren't they adding, aren't they adding like obi-wan Kenobi?
[3857.14s -> 3858.36s]  Three stooges is too,
[3858.36s -> 3859.83s]  Pac-Man?
[3859.83s -> 3864.07s]  Pac-Man, how is Pac-Man not Boomer?
[3864.07s -> 3864.91s]  All right.
[3864.91s -> 3867.62s]  Where do I make change?
[3867.62s -> 3870.46s]  That's fucking weird.
[3870.46s -> 3871.28s]  Oh my God.
[3871.28s -> 3872.12s]  Why is it all the way over here?
[3872.12s -> 3878.26s]  What a terribly designed place.
[3878.26s -> 3883.92s]  Pac-Man's coming next week.
[3883.94s -> 3886.62s]  They're gonna add all the Wizard of Oz characters.
[3886.62s -> 3891.62s]  Dorothy, Tin Man, the Tiger, the Scarecrow.
[3892.78s -> 3893.62s]  They're gonna add,
[3893.62s -> 3895.40s]  there was gonna be a Wizard of Oz update.
[3895.40s -> 3900.51s]  They're gonna add, okay.
[3900.51s -> 3901.35s]  They're gonna be,
[3901.35s -> 3903.63s]  I feel so pissed off about this.
[3903.63s -> 3905.77s]  I'm gonna have like FOMO on this.
[3905.77s -> 3907.85s]  Because if I don't make a bet here
[3907.85s -> 3910.75s]  and they add the Wizard of Oz characters like in a year,
[3910.75s -> 3911.59s]  I'm gonna be pissed
[3911.59s -> 3917.08s]  because I could have told you I was right.
[3917.08s -> 3917.92s]  You know what I mean?
[3917.92s -> 3919.18s]  Like I didn't say that.
[3919.18s -> 3925.15s]  I was, I may have started to say it, but I didn't say it.
[3925.17s -> 3930.13s]  Take a look at the other stores and the plaza.
[3930.13s -> 3931.80s]  How much are you gonna put up?
[3931.80s -> 3935.32s]  There's no way they're gonna add the Wizard of Oz.
[3935.32s -> 3940.57s]  What about like Willy Wonka, right?
[3940.57s -> 3943.44s]  Also, I don't know why I'm attributing,
[3943.44s -> 3945.88s]  fuck, this is what's happening.
[3945.88s -> 3949.14s]  I am attributing all the slot machines in the casino
[3949.14s -> 3951.28s]  with what is popular with the Fortnite kids,
[3951.28s -> 3953.66s]  which is completely inaccurate.
[3953.66s -> 3957.16s]  Willy Wonka slot machines are literally fucking everywhere.
[3957.16s -> 3961.28s]  Wizard of Oz slot machines everywhere.
[3961.28s -> 3967.03s]  The three stooges have a bunch of slot machines.
[3967.03s -> 3972.40s]  I'm doing this wrong.
[3972.42s -> 3978.98s]  I still think, sounds like a child crying,
[3978.98s -> 3991.78s]  but I don't think it's a kid.
[3991.78s -> 3995.57s]  Shoes.
[3995.57s -> 3997.01s]  That's cause boomers play slot machines
[3997.01s -> 4001.26s]  and zoomers bet on Fortnite skins.
[4001.26s -> 4004.80s]  Just wait, I am, are you ready?
[4004.80s -> 4006.46s]  Listen to me.
[4006.46s -> 4007.42s]  You can, in a hundred years,
[4007.42s -> 4009.65s]  you can go back and watch this clip.
[4009.65s -> 4012.33s]  They are going to have to pivot soon
[4012.33s -> 4014.46s]  in these Vegas casinos
[4014.46s -> 4016.86s]  because all the Wizard of Oz slot machines
[4016.86s -> 4020.24s]  are not gonna do very well when the zoomers are like,
[4020.24s -> 4023.66s]  no, no, no, no, I want, where's my Fortnite machine?
[4023.68s -> 4026.08s]  There's gonna be Fortnite machines.
[4026.08s -> 4030.65s]  There's gonna be video game, like zoomer type machines.
[4030.65s -> 4031.49s]  There's not, I don't think,
[4031.49s -> 4036.30s]  I think slot machines might be replaced, but like skins.
[4036.30s -> 4038.18s]  You sit down and you like pull the machine.
[4038.18s -> 4042.28s]  It's like the skin, like a box opening.
[4042.28s -> 4044.44s]  I think, I don't know in like the next 50 years or so,
[4044.44s -> 4048.69s]  if people are gonna care that much about spinning a slot,
[4048.69s -> 4051.01s]  just in making, oh, like I hit money.
[4051.01s -> 4052.05s]  I don't think so.
[4052.05s -> 4055.11s]  I don't think the younger generation cares that much.
[4055.11s -> 4058.38s]  I think like Fortnite skins might be more,
[4058.48s -> 4061.74s]  or some type of video game thing.
[4061.74s -> 4063.61s]  A Morbius slot machine.
[4063.61s -> 4065.26s]  I'd play it.
[4065.26s -> 4066.42s]  I'd never even seen the movie.
[4066.42s -> 4072.16s]  I would just sit there and like laugh.
[4072.16s -> 4073.60s]  Morbius slots.
[4073.60s -> 4085.88s]  Customer, looking for a TV, toaster?
[4085.88s -> 4089.66s]  Sorry, I'm just browsing.
[4089.66s -> 4092.46s]  What kind of person just browses the appliance stores
[4092.46s -> 4096.20s]  at this time of night?
[4096.20s -> 4100.20s]  I don't know if I, I mean, anytime I go to like a Best Buy,
[4100.20s -> 4103.04s]  I always just end up walking around the washer
[4103.04s -> 4107.66s]  and dryers and stoves and just go, oh, that's nice.
[4107.68s -> 4108.88s]  I'm never gonna buy one of those,
[4108.88s -> 4112.42s]  but you kind of just walk around and just open up the lid,
[4112.42s -> 4114.97s]  turn the dial.
[4114.97s -> 4115.81s]  That's it.
[4115.81s -> 4116.93s]  I'm just waiting on my laundry.
[4116.93s -> 4120.49s]  Well, then why don't you just buy a washer and dry here?
[4120.49s -> 4124.09s]  We have the newest models at the lowest prices.
[4124.09s -> 4128.42s]  That's such a stoner thing to do.
[4128.42s -> 4130.48s]  I've never heard of a stoner that's like,
[4130.48s -> 4133.48s]  yo, bro, let's go look at the washing machines
[4133.48s -> 4138.51s]  at Best Buy, dude.
[4138.51s -> 4143.27s]  No, it's like, I've been abducted by aliens
[4143.27s -> 4145.19s]  and like, I think aliens exist.
[4145.19s -> 4147.85s]  And like, I think the aliens are all,
[4147.85s -> 4151.35s]  are putting the TV shows on the TV stations.
[4151.35s -> 4156.73s]  That's like a, I'm high conversation.
[4156.73s -> 4159.29s]  I'm a fan, but I feel like you're the newest thing
[4159.29s -> 4161.90s]  in the store.
[4161.90s -> 4164.58s]  That's meth.
[4164.58s -> 4165.54s]  Well, thank you.
[4167.00s -> 4168.68s]  You take pride in my appearance.
[4168.68s -> 4169.72s]  Oh, wait, question marks.
[4169.72s -> 4170.54s]  What are you talking about?
[4170.54s -> 4173.68s]  You talk about like weird existential shit when you're high.
[4173.68s -> 4185.08s]  Not, I want to go look at Best Buy washing machines.
[4185.08s -> 4186.58s]  Now, when you get high, you think about,
[4186.58s -> 4189.10s]  are all my friends actors?
[4189.92s -> 4190.76s]  You know what I mean?
[4190.76s -> 4196.73s]  Not, oh, I want to go look at the washing machine.
[4196.73s -> 4203.05s]  Customer, looking for a TV, toaster.
[4203.05s -> 4204.89s]  What are you talking about?
[4204.89s -> 4206.45s]  I'm not saying you really think that.
[4206.45s -> 4209.48s]  You sit there in the couch and you go,
[4209.48s -> 4212.80s]  holy shit, what if like, we're all actors?
[4215.71s -> 4220.10s]  You guys don't have those gone, what?
[4220.10s -> 4222.24s]  I don't, I've never gotten high and gone,
[4222.24s -> 4223.64s]  everybody's an actor.
[4223.64s -> 4226.36s]  No, I've got, I'm go, man, wouldn't it be crazy
[4226.36s -> 4230.70s]  if everybody was an actor?
[4230.70s -> 4232.70s]  Sorry, I'm just browsing.
[4234.71s -> 4236.05s]  You're delusional.
[4239.64s -> 4241.36s]  I keep talking to this person.
[4242.24s -> 4243.08s]  Get away from me.
[4243.08s -> 4244.68s]  Okay, what do you got here?
[4244.68s -> 4250.76s]  TV?
[4250.76s -> 4253.52s]  Oh, look, drying machine.
[4253.52s -> 4257.28s]  Oh, wow, that could fit probably like two, three loads.
[4257.28s -> 4259.76s]  Cool.
[4259.76s -> 4262.20s]  No, you know, I'm not a big fan of the front loaders.
[4262.20s -> 4270.88s]  I'm not a front loader guy, no, not really, no.
[4270.88s -> 4276.24s]  Oven, stereo, radio, can I,
[4276.24s -> 4277.56s]  what am I supposed to do here?
[4277.56s -> 4279.11s]  A lock box.
[4279.11s -> 4280.43s]  I need a code to go in it.
[4280.45s -> 4290.54s]  Okay, I need a code for the lock box.
[4290.54s -> 4291.90s]  Okay, well, goodbye.
[4291.90s -> 4302.50s]  I need a code for the lock box.
[4302.50s -> 4315.30s]  Pizza.
[4315.30s -> 4317.26s]  Sorry, didn't see you there.
[4317.26s -> 4318.10s]  What time is it?
[4318.10s -> 4319.70s]  Can I get you anything?
[4319.70s -> 4320.82s]  No, thanks.
[4320.82s -> 4323.80s]  I'm just killing time until my laundry next door is done.
[4323.80s -> 4326.62s]  Well, you're out. How about it was supposed to be late?
[4326.62s -> 4329.72s]  Just a heads up, we're closing soon.
[4329.72s -> 4331.68s]  Feel free to hang out until then, though.
[4331.68s -> 4333.32s]  Ask for pizza?
[4333.32s -> 4335.43s]  What do you got here?
[4335.43s -> 4339.09s]  They're about to close, so the pizza is pretty stale now.
[4339.09s -> 4340.17s]  That's not what I asked.
[4340.43s -> 4344.90s]  I'm fine, that's all right.
[4344.90s -> 4350.65s]  Soda fountain, trash can.
[4350.65s -> 4353.32s]  Any codes in here?
[4353.32s -> 4357.96s]  This is, what is this?
[4357.96s -> 4359.04s]  Sin eater.
[4362.11s -> 4370.43s]  I knew the whole thing.
[4370.43s -> 4372.53s]  I did not realize that was gonna be that flashing.
[4372.53s -> 4373.37s]  I'm sorry.
[4374.31s -> 4375.71s]  I thought it was gonna be,
[4375.71s -> 4376.99s]  I thought it was gonna be colors.
[4376.99s -> 4378.71s]  I didn't know it was gonna be black and white.
[4378.71s -> 4380.03s]  I'm really sorry.
[4380.03s -> 4382.57s]  I thought it was gonna be like this one.
[4382.57s -> 4384.45s]  I thought it was gonna be like this one.
[4384.45s -> 4387.35s]  Like, look, that's not a problem doing it like this.
[4387.35s -> 4388.45s]  I didn't know it was gonna be black and white.
[4388.55s -> 4389.39s]  I'm really sorry.
[4389.39s -> 4390.71s]  That actually, I didn't know it was gonna be that painful.
[4390.71s -> 4394.22s]  I'm actually really sorry.
[4394.22s -> 4396.94s]  I was trying to inhale the magazine.
[4396.94s -> 4398.94s]  I just got flash-banked.
[4398.94s -> 4416.58s]  What the fuck is this?
[4416.58s -> 4427.50s]  Okay, guys, that's a dick.
[4427.50s -> 4432.99s]  Okay, well, sorry.
[4432.99s -> 4434.83s]  That's back-to-back, kind of.
[4434.83s -> 4436.03s]  I didn't mean to do that.
[4436.03s -> 4438.59s]  I thought that was not gonna be as flashing,
[4438.59s -> 4443.80s]  and then you got flashed anyways a few moments later.
[4443.80s -> 4446.06s]  So I'm really sorry about that, back-to-back.
[4446.06s -> 4451.60s]  Nobody else is gonna, okay, very sorry.
[4451.60s -> 4453.74s]  Can I do anything else in here?
[4453.74s -> 4454.82s]  I get nothing.
[4454.82s -> 4457.12s]  Well, you're out.
[4457.12s -> 4463.68s]  No pizza, vending machine, no.
[4463.68s -> 4465.04s]  You flash-banked your audience
[4465.04s -> 4470.29s]  and then showed him a dick, great start.
[4470.29s -> 4472.73s]  Shit, I wanna be more careful with that.
[4472.73s -> 4473.57s]  I didn't know.
[4473.57s -> 4479.54s]  I actually am annoyed that I just did that.
[4479.54s -> 4486.80s]  All right, so where are we going now?
[4486.80s -> 4492.40s]  Peapaws?
[4492.40s -> 4496.60s]  No refunds or exchanges, all sales final.
[4496.60s -> 4497.44s]  Peapaw.
[4497.44s -> 4498.76s]  Can I help you?
[4498.76s -> 4502.52s]  Looking for anything specific?
[4502.52s -> 4504.88s]  Looking for something specific?
[4504.90s -> 4506.84s]  You have a great day now.
[4506.84s -> 4508.04s]  A movie?
[4508.04s -> 4510.02s]  A video game?
[4510.02s -> 4511.34s]  Fish?
[4511.34s -> 4517.47s]  No, just browsing, thanks.
[4517.47s -> 4523.10s]  Let me know if you need any help.
[4523.10s -> 4525.62s]  And don't you even think about stealing anything?
[4525.62s -> 4530.16s]  I have eyes everywhere.
[4530.16s -> 4531.76s]  Wouldn't dream of it.
[4531.76s -> 4533.40s]  You have quite an assortment of-
[4533.40s -> 4535.52s]  It's Peapaws.
[4535.52s -> 4537.08s]  I'm Peapaw.
[4537.08s -> 4539.84s]  It's my store.
[4539.84s -> 4540.68s]  PeaPants.
[4540.68s -> 4545.09s]  Right.
[4545.09s -> 4547.17s]  Am I allowed to tell the story of PeaPants?
[4549.16s -> 4550.64s]  I mean, I tell it like once every two years,
[4550.64s -> 4552.76s]  but I feel like we have a lot more viewers here now.
[4552.76s -> 4558.43s]  Can I just do your TLDR?
[4558.43s -> 4559.88s]  What is that?
[4559.88s -> 4561.10s]  Read Reapers, what?
[4561.10s -> 4562.58s]  No, I'm not doing this.
[4562.58s -> 4568.92s]  I mean, this is cool.
[4568.92s -> 4569.84s]  This is, I mean, this is cool.
[4569.84s -> 4572.12s]  They got like these comics in here.
[4572.12s -> 4573.72s]  This is cool.
[4573.72s -> 4576.80s]  They got comic books you can read.
[4576.80s -> 4577.96s]  Okay, well, we're gonna have,
[4577.96s -> 4579.52s]  we're gonna just go like this for now.
[4579.52s -> 4580.36s]  We're gonna go like this.
[4580.36s -> 4581.86s]  We're just gonna get rid of those.
[4581.86s -> 4582.88s]  Okay, cool.
[4589.41s -> 4593.73s]  There's probably an item in here.
[4593.73s -> 4598.93s]  Or no, tapes.
[4598.93s -> 4600.65s]  Okay, get it.
[4600.65s -> 4602.57s]  I'm putting my hand up over this screen.
[4602.57s -> 4604.06s]  What am I doing?
[4604.06s -> 4604.90s]  What am I doing?
[4604.90s -> 4606.28s]  What?
[4606.28s -> 4607.42s]  I can't put my hand up on,
[4607.42s -> 4609.42s]  I just put my hand up to block it
[4609.42s -> 4611.02s]  like you were behind me.
[4611.02s -> 4612.02s]  Hold on.
[4612.02s -> 4612.86s]  What the fuck?
[4612.86s -> 4617.53s]  Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
[4617.53s -> 4623.64s]  Does that, do I need to be in here for anything?
[4623.64s -> 4625.06s]  I swear to God, there's probably something in here
[4625.06s -> 4626.97s]  that I need to get.
[4626.97s -> 4628.13s]  Okay, okay.
[4632.18s -> 4633.02s]  I was looking.
[4634.14s -> 4635.90s]  That's not what you wanna have happen
[4635.90s -> 4637.86s]  coming out of this room.
[4637.86s -> 4639.06s]  This is like, you put the hat down,
[4639.68s -> 4641.20s]  and you go like this, and you're like.
[4641.20s -> 4645.41s]  No, hey, how are ya?
[4647.30s -> 4648.82s]  You're not stealing anything?
[4648.82s -> 4650.42s]  No.
[4650.42s -> 4664.04s]  My apologies.
[4664.04s -> 4666.20s]  My friend was making a joke about,
[4666.20s -> 4668.68s]  let's go into the porn section,
[4668.68s -> 4670.80s]  and it was funny, it was like,
[4670.80s -> 4671.64s]  you have one of these?
[4671.64s -> 4672.78s]  That's crazy.
[4672.78s -> 4673.62s]  I was just saying,
[4673.62s -> 4675.20s]  I couldn't believe you actually had one of these.
[4675.20s -> 4676.04s]  This is crazy.
[4676.04s -> 4676.88s]  Like, what the fuck?
[4676.88s -> 4682.28s]  I was going into it, like, that's funny.
[4685.50s -> 4701.00s]  Should I buy a gumball?
[4701.00s -> 4702.96s]  Ooh, games.
[4703.74s -> 4704.78s]  The Master system is out now.
[4704.78s -> 4707.20s]  This is still my favorite.
[4707.20s -> 4708.96s]  Okay, I don't think I,
[4708.96s -> 4710.96s]  my laundry has probably been done for an hour.
[4710.96s -> 4719.82s]  What am I doing still here?
[4719.82s -> 4721.34s]  Oh, the story of pee pants, right.
[4721.34s -> 4722.43s]  Okay.
[4722.43s -> 4726.24s]  So, Burger Boy and I used to play Smite all the time,
[4726.24s -> 4727.70s]  and we would just, you know,
[4727.70s -> 4729.44s]  you'd make the,
[4729.44s -> 4731.36s]  I think it was like a party or something.
[4731.36s -> 4733.20s]  You had to like join with a password or something,
[4733.20s -> 4735.22s]  whatever it was.
[4735.22s -> 4737.38s]  So, we would be playing games,
[4737.38s -> 4739.88s]  and we'd be making the,
[4739.88s -> 4741.28s]  yeah, Smite, okay, whatever, fine.
[4741.90s -> 4743.84s]  You batch-ass me all you want.
[4743.84s -> 4746.34s]  So, we were in the,
[4746.34s -> 4748.99s]  essentially, I was being told,
[4748.99s -> 4751.35s]  hey, here's the password to get into the lobby,
[4751.35s -> 4753.87s]  so then we can queue up together or whatever it was.
[4753.87s -> 4756.03s]  So, he gives me the password.
[4756.03s -> 4756.87s]  He's like, hey, this is it,
[4756.87s -> 4757.91s]  the password is pee pants.
[4757.91s -> 4758.75s]  And I was like, okay, fine.
[4758.75s -> 4760.45s]  So, I'm like, pee pants.
[4760.45s -> 4761.27s]  It doesn't work.
[4761.27s -> 4762.11s]  So, the password is incorrect.
[4762.11s -> 4764.12s]  I say, hey, dude, the password is incorrect.
[4764.12s -> 4766.04s]  This doesn't, there's no,
[4766.04s -> 4767.65s]  it's not pee pants.
[4767.65s -> 4769.55s]  And Burger Boy looks at me and he just goes,
[4769.55s -> 4770.85s]  yeah, it is.
[4770.85s -> 4772.29s]  By the way, Burger Boy was high.
[4772.29s -> 4774.45s]  He was like as high as a kite.
[4775.35s -> 4777.35s]  And he's sitting there going, it's pee pants, dude.
[4777.35s -> 4779.31s]  I was like, Burger Boy, it's not.
[4779.31s -> 4780.15s]  Is there a space?
[4780.15s -> 4782.33s]  Is it like pee space pants?
[4782.33s -> 4786.11s]  No, it's just no spaces, no capitals, pee pants.
[4786.11s -> 4789.11s]  I'm just like, I keep typing that, it's not it.
[4789.11s -> 4791.07s]  And me and him get into an argument
[4791.07s -> 4794.51s]  about how he thinks I'm fucking with him
[4794.51s -> 4798.30s]  because it's pee pants and you're not doing it
[4798.30s -> 4801.22s]  and this is annoying and I wanna play.
[4801.22s -> 4803.26s]  So, eventually, finally, after probably
[4803.26s -> 4804.94s]  at least three to five straight minutes
[4804.94s -> 4807.46s]  of being annoyed with each other,
[4807.46s -> 4809.92s]  I go, how are you spelling this?
[4809.92s -> 4812.32s]  And I walk over and I show him what I'm typing
[4812.32s -> 4813.48s]  and he's like, what?
[4813.48s -> 4819.86s]  This not, he's like, this, pee pants.
[4819.86s -> 4823.58s]  That's how we thought it was spelled.
[4823.58s -> 4829.24s]  He thought it was P-A-N-C-E in his like high weed brain.
[4829.24s -> 4831.14s]  So, we were actually in a pretty,
[4831.14s -> 4833.84s]  it was, I was not, we were both pretty annoyed
[4833.84s -> 4836.24s]  and he was spelling it P-A-N-C-E
[4836.24s -> 4840.78s]  and that's how we thought pants was spelled in that moment.
[4840.78s -> 4843.68s]  And then, finally, he sat there
[4843.68s -> 4846.29s]  and he was just like laughing his ass off
[4847.19s -> 4850.21s]  and then pee pants just became a verb
[4850.21s -> 4852.79s]  that we just started using.
[4852.79s -> 4854.07s]  We would call each other that
[4854.07s -> 4856.44s]  if we had like a stupid moment.
[4856.44s -> 4857.80s]  It'd be like, oh, hey, yeah, hey, pee pants.
[4857.80s -> 4859.88s]  Oh, come on, pee pants.
[4859.88s -> 4861.12s]  Like, we just started calling each other that.
[4861.12s -> 4864.73s]  We started using it as a verb and stuff.
[4864.73s -> 4867.60s]  Oh, dude, that's, you're a wicked pee pants right now.
[4867.60s -> 4869.64s]  Oh, yeah, okay, yeah.
[4869.64s -> 4870.56s]  It was fun.
[4870.56s -> 4872.24s]  Using it as a noun, verb.
[4872.24s -> 4874.42s]  We pretty much used it as,
[4874.42s -> 4877.86s]  we used to use random words, kind of like smurfs.
[4877.86s -> 4880.62s]  We'd replace them as nouns and verbs
[4880.62s -> 4882.96s]  and it was just a smurf language.
[4882.96s -> 4883.86s]  It was weird.
[4883.86s -> 4892.04s]  We used to do it all the time with tons of stuff.
[4892.04s -> 4895.05s]  Who the fuck is Burger Boy?
[4895.05s -> 4911.80s]  Oh, that's a new viewers.
[4911.80s -> 4920.12s]  Okay, so I think I'm ready.
[4920.12s -> 4924.34s]  Okay, I thought someone was coming to get me.
[4924.34s -> 4925.72s]  Why is he called Burger Boy though?
[4925.72s -> 4926.54s]  I don't know.
[4926.54s -> 4927.38s]  Maybe it has something to do with the fact
[4927.38s -> 4928.84s]  that he used to bring double cheeseburgers
[4928.84s -> 4929.96s]  into the movie theater.
[4929.96s -> 4932.61s]  Like they were popcorn.
[4932.61s -> 4934.93s]  Like a bag of at least four to six of them
[4934.93s -> 4936.78s]  and eat them for the movie.
[4936.78s -> 4946.73s]  That might have had something to do with it.
[4946.73s -> 4948.70s]  Did I get the laundry?
[4948.70s -> 4955.53s]  You haven't said that.
[4955.53s -> 4956.53s]  How do I use the dryers?
[4956.53s -> 4974.99s]  Are these washers?
[4974.99s -> 4979.58s]  Bathroom key?
[4979.60s -> 4980.44s]  That's old lore.
[4980.44s -> 4982.50s]  Oh yeah, that's, I mean,
[4982.50s -> 4987.20s]  I know I've told that story before.
[4987.20s -> 4995.66s]  Okay, so go to the bathroom.
[4995.66s -> 4997.86s]  You've told the pee pants stream a bunch of times too.
[4997.86s -> 5000.80s]  Oh yeah.
[5000.80s -> 5001.64s]  Do you guys still talk?
[5001.64s -> 5007.61s]  Yeah, from time to time.
[5007.61s -> 5010.72s]  I think he's doing all right.
[5010.72s -> 5012.46s]  Just living on the West Coast.
[5012.46s -> 5015.60s]  A lot of people that I would talk to on a regular basis.
[5015.60s -> 5017.79s]  Obviously I live in Vegas, right?
[5017.79s -> 5020.77s]  But yeah, I think he's doing pretty good.
[5020.77s -> 5024.41s]  Last time I talked to him.
[5024.41s -> 5034.74s]  Don't I have the key?
[5034.74s -> 5049.21s]  God damn it.
[5049.21s -> 5052.42s]  Now I'm gonna read that.
[5052.42s -> 5055.19s]  Six, seven, five, eight.
[5055.19s -> 5056.67s]  This might be fun to call if I get bored.
[5056.73s -> 5059.17s]  There's a phone in the lobby.
[5059.17s -> 5061.45s]  Really?
[5061.45s -> 5076.50s]  Really?
[5076.50s -> 5080.67s]  Wait, why did I go in here?
[5080.67s -> 5081.75s]  There's something I need?
[5081.75s -> 5083.44s]  Police report.
[5083.44s -> 5087.12s]  Police report that details a suspect named Lewis Kennedy.
[5087.12s -> 5089.12s]  This is just for public intoxication,
[5089.12s -> 5090.66s]  but that name keeps popping up.
[5090.66s -> 5092.66s]  Wonder if I can find out more about him.
[5092.66s -> 5094.32s]  Bring this to the people and see if they have anything
[5094.32s -> 5096.12s]  to say about it.
[5096.12s -> 5097.22s]  Do something funny.
[5097.22s -> 5098.30s]  Your dog is crying.
[5098.30s -> 5103.86s]  Why does your dog care if I make a joke or not?
[5103.86s -> 5106.04s]  Oh my God, there's somebody in here.
[5106.04s -> 5108.99s]  Oh my God.
[5108.99s -> 5113.84s]  Is there an item I need over here or anything?
[5113.90s -> 5114.74s]  Dude, okay.
[5114.74s -> 5119.70s]  This is probably something I need right here.
[5119.70s -> 5121.66s]  Nothing?
[5121.66s -> 5131.59s]  Okay, goodbye.
[5131.59s -> 5133.23s]  What is, who's that?
[5139.81s -> 5141.05s]  What happened?
[5141.05s -> 5142.45s]  I feel like I was supposed to be scared.
[5142.45s -> 5145.18s]  I was like, why is there a naked guy?
[5145.18s -> 5150.34s]  What happened?
[5150.34s -> 5151.26s]  I just turned the quarter
[5151.26s -> 5152.54s]  and I thought there was a naked person
[5152.54s -> 5153.46s]  so I just went like this
[5153.46s -> 5156.95s]  and then I was supposed to get jump scared, I think.
[5156.95s -> 5157.79s]  Who put this here?
[5157.79s -> 5165.78s]  I don't know.
[5165.78s -> 5167.40s]  Did you do that?
[5167.40s -> 5169.14s]  Doing the late night wash too.
[5169.14s -> 5174.05s]  Yeah, I work night shift at the factory down the road.
[5174.05s -> 5175.73s]  This place is the only one open.
[5175.73s -> 5177.47s]  Yeah, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know,
[5177.47s -> 5179.11s]  we know, we know, we know, we know, we know.
[5179.11s -> 5179.95s]  Mysterious.
[5181.27s -> 5182.51s]  Doing the late night wash.
[5182.51s -> 5184.27s]  The first one, that's good, but what?
[5185.45s -> 5187.15s]  Okay, don't click again.
[5187.15s -> 5190.20s]  Do you know anything about this?
[5190.20s -> 5191.80s]  No, not these comic books.
[5191.80s -> 5192.64s]  This.
[5192.64s -> 5196.84s]  Don't know how you got that, but yeah, I knew Louis.
[5196.84s -> 5199.90s]  He owned the old laundromat that burnt down.
[5199.90s -> 5204.47s]  We were buds, but he disappeared one day.
[5204.47s -> 5206.39s]  It's the aliens, I tell ya.
[5206.39s -> 5209.17s]  Louis is looking down on us poor schmucks right now
[5209.17s -> 5211.33s]  from the cosmos.
[5211.33s -> 5212.53s]  Do you know anything about this?
[5212.53s -> 5228.99s]  Shows him a porno mag.
[5228.99s -> 5235.27s]  So I just gotta show this to people in the town
[5235.27s -> 5236.33s]  that sounds like you.
[5236.33s -> 5237.43s]  Call that number.
[5239.72s -> 5243.70s]  Don't tell me what to do.
[5243.70s -> 5248.51s]  Okay, where's the phone?
[5248.51s -> 5249.35s]  Oh, what?
[5249.35s -> 5251.03s]  The phone is ringing.
[5251.03s -> 5255.70s]  You will be connected to the girl
[5255.70s -> 5258.54s]  of your wildest fantasies for 63 seconds.
[5259.62s -> 5262.38s]  Well, hey there, stud.
[5262.38s -> 5263.80s]  All right, for one second,
[5263.80s -> 5268.56s]  one second I thought she said 63 seconds
[5268.56s -> 5270.00s]  in English accent.
[5270.00s -> 5274.80s]  Not 63 seconds, 63.
[5274.80s -> 5277.30s]  You'll be connected for 63 seconds.
[5277.30s -> 5278.14s]  I was like, what?
[5278.14s -> 5278.96s]  Oh, okay, that's a weird number.
[5278.96s -> 5279.80s]  And then I read it.
[5279.80s -> 5283.31s]  Cool, no?
[5283.31s -> 5287.15s]  I mean, hey there.
[5287.15s -> 5289.49s]  I'm so glad you called.
[5289.49s -> 5292.41s]  It's been so lonely over here.
[5292.41s -> 5294.93s]  Been thinking about your big cut.
[5296.30s -> 5297.50s]  Wait.
[5297.50s -> 5298.78s]  Damn it, I'm sorry.
[5299.56s -> 5300.80s]  This is my first night on the job.
[5300.80s -> 5304.00s]  I don't think it's for me.
[5304.00s -> 5304.84s]  That's okay.
[5304.84s -> 5307.64s]  I didn't even know what this number was for.
[5307.64s -> 5309.16s]  I just called for cakes.
[5309.16s -> 5310.48s]  The phone rang.
[5310.48s -> 5312.76s]  Oh, it's been one night,
[5312.76s -> 5314.76s]  but I've had my fair share of creeps.
[5314.76s -> 5317.03s]  Didn't the phone ring?
[5317.03s -> 5317.87s]  I didn't call.
[5317.87s -> 5320.91s]  I answered the phone.
[5320.91s -> 5322.75s]  A person just dials a random phone number
[5322.75s -> 5324.39s]  at this time of night.
[5324.39s -> 5325.75s]  A burnt out college student
[5325.75s -> 5326.59s]  who's waiting for on-
[5326.59s -> 5327.91s]  I didn't make any phone calls.
[5327.91s -> 5330.27s]  Go home and get some sleep.
[5330.27s -> 5332.79s]  Those places are still open at this time of night?
[5333.94s -> 5336.62s]  Not just this one a little out of town.
[5336.62s -> 5341.28s]  Wait, in that plaza with the pizza palace?
[5341.28s -> 5346.20s]  Oh, that one.
[5346.20s -> 5348.20s]  Hey, you really shouldn't be out over there
[5348.20s -> 5349.04s]  this late at night,
[5349.04s -> 5350.84s]  not with the womb ripper at large.
[5350.84s -> 5352.46s]  I remember,
[5352.46s -> 5355.18s]  do you guys remember the commercials late at night on TV
[5355.18s -> 5358.42s]  for these lines that were 1-900 numbers?
[5358.42s -> 5360.42s]  It's like, call now
[5360.42s -> 5363.70s]  and talk to the hardest of all of us, right?
[5363.70s -> 5365.78s]  Now, do you remember those?
[5365.78s -> 5368.60s]  And it was always like two or three dollars a minute.
[5368.60s -> 5371.29s]  I remember just sitting there going,
[5372.15s -> 5373.23s]  I wonder,
[5373.23s -> 5378.04s]  do they like try to keep people on the phone?
[5378.04s -> 5381.74s]  And the more that I thought about it is like,
[5381.74s -> 5383.26s]  oh, I'm trying to think of ways
[5383.26s -> 5384.10s]  if you would keep somebody on the phone
[5384.10s -> 5385.80s]  for two dollars a minute.
[5385.80s -> 5387.95s]  And one of the things I was thinking of was,
[5387.95s -> 5389.87s]  oh yeah, it would be so sexy
[5389.87s -> 5392.95s]  if we played a full game of Monopoly over the phone.
[5392.95s -> 5395.99s]  Oh, I would think that was so hot.
[5395.99s -> 5397.03s]  Yeah, you do?
[5397.03s -> 5400.19s]  Yeah, yeah.
[5400.19s -> 5401.27s]  That'd be like,
[5401.27s -> 5402.19s]  oh, you know,
[5402.19s -> 5406.21s]  if we could play Risk, that would be fantastic.
[5406.21s -> 5409.87s]  Just gave them there.
[5409.89s -> 5410.97s]  They were always so weird, though.
[5410.97s -> 5412.21s]  I remember just being,
[5412.21s -> 5414.45s]  because I was an infomercial aficionado, right?
[5414.45s -> 5415.94s]  We all know that.
[5415.94s -> 5417.66s]  But in between those,
[5417.66s -> 5422.58s]  or on random channels at the past 12, 1 a.m.,
[5422.58s -> 5431.90s]  you'd get those ads all the time.
[5431.90s -> 5434.20s]  You called them.
[5434.20s -> 5436.08s]  Do you guys really think,
[5440.41s -> 5447.18s]  so I'm gonna call and have sent to my parents' house?
[5447.18s -> 5448.70s]  Huh?
[5448.70s -> 5450.06s]  I wasn't even fucking old enough
[5450.06s -> 5452.47s]  to make these phone calls, I don't think.
[5452.47s -> 5455.66s]  Why would I, what are you talking about?
[5455.68s -> 5460.85s]  I am in no way going to have my mother or father back then
[5461.86s -> 5464.26s]  be like, why is there,
[5464.26s -> 5465.86s]  why is there all this shit here?
[5465.86s -> 5467.86s]  Why would there, I never thought they were worth it.
[5467.86s -> 5471.86s]  I was like, I'm not gonna call these.
[5471.86s -> 5473.66s]  I'm like, I don't know, I don't wanna do that.
[5473.66s -> 5475.47s]  That's weird.
[5475.47s -> 5476.77s]  He's offended.
[5476.77s -> 5482.12s]  What an obvious lie.
[5482.12s -> 5485.72s]  The 30 second call the 1-900 number
[5485.72s -> 5488.28s]  that we're just talking, taking the piss on right now.
[5488.28s -> 5490.74s]  You think I was calling it every day?
[5492.48s -> 5494.64s]  You're weirdly defensive about this.
[5494.64s -> 5497.60s]  I have not called one of these numbers.
[5497.60s -> 5501.53s]  I was with one eye open like this.
[5501.53s -> 5502.69s]  What's that on TV?
[5502.69s -> 5504.94s]  I don't fucking care.
[5504.94s -> 5506.30s]  Where's Kathy Mitchell?
[5506.30s -> 5507.14s]  Right, no.
[5509.14s -> 5510.76s]  No.
[5510.76s -> 5512.32s]  Why do I do this to myself?
[5512.32s -> 5513.28s]  Why do I do this?
[5513.28s -> 5514.72s]  Why are you doing this to me?
[5514.72s -> 5515.72s]  Listen to me.
[5515.72s -> 5519.36s]  I mean, infomercials, infomercials, infomercials,
[5519.36s -> 5521.72s]  infomercials, I wanted to watch infomercials,
[5522.38s -> 5524.42s]  call fucking, okay.
[5524.42s -> 5526.22s]  All right, that's enough.
[5526.22s -> 5527.78s]  Why are you doing this to me?
[5527.78s -> 5530.02s]  That's enough, that's enough.
[5530.02s -> 5533.43s]  There's some things that the newspapers don't talk about.
[5533.43s -> 5546.31s]  There's things to get out of.
[5546.31s -> 5547.49s]  Look at how red I am.
[5547.49s -> 5548.79s]  I'm like embarrassed.
[5548.79s -> 5550.11s]  I don't want anybody to think this.
[5550.11s -> 5552.30s]  There's more to it than just talking and killing.
[5552.30s -> 5553.14s]  Fuck.
[5553.14s -> 5553.96s]  It's a real psychopath
[5553.96s -> 5555.82s]  and you are right in the middle of its hunting grounds.
[5555.82s -> 5559.32s]  Do you understand? Shit, shit.
[5559.32s -> 5561.04s]  You need to take your laundry right now
[5561.04s -> 5563.28s]  and get out of there as fast as you can.
[5563.30s -> 5565.54s]  That's like embarrassing.
[5565.54s -> 5567.46s]  What is going on in this dialogue?
[5581.26s -> 5582.86s]  It's the same reason why hotels,
[5582.86s -> 5586.76s]  when they had all the porn in the hotel rooms.
[5586.76s -> 5589.47s]  I didn't want to check out of a hotel
[5589.47s -> 5594.47s]  and walk up to the person at the checkout counter
[5595.39s -> 5598.07s]  and, sir, would you like a receipt?
[5598.07s -> 5600.95s]  No, no, no.
[5600.95s -> 5602.03s]  Don't look at the receipt.
[5602.03s -> 5604.11s]  Just, you know what?
[5604.11s -> 5605.71s]  Here's $200 cash.
[5605.73s -> 5606.73s]  I don't want you to print the receipt.
[5606.73s -> 5608.13s]  I don't want you to look at the receipt.
[5608.13s -> 5611.29s]  Can you drag the receipt into the recycling bin right now?
[5611.29s -> 5614.10s]  I'll give you $200 right now.
[5614.10s -> 5616.70s]  Sir, it says you only have about $42 in charges.
[5616.70s -> 5617.54s]  No, just don't open it.
[5617.54s -> 5618.46s]  And here's $200 cash.
[5618.46s -> 5619.30s]  Don't look at the receipt.
[5619.30s -> 5621.90s]  Don't look at it.
[5621.90s -> 5622.74s]  I don't know.
[5622.74s -> 5624.64s]  I don't want to talk to somebody and be like,
[5624.64s -> 5625.48s]  oh, hey, by the way,
[5625.48s -> 5628.12s]  oh, what do we have with these charges?
[5628.12s -> 5632.09s]  Some incidental charges to the room.
[5636.03s -> 5643.83s]  No.
[5643.83s -> 5644.65s]  So you bought it.
[5644.65s -> 5645.49s]  No, I didn't.
[5645.49s -> 5646.33s]  I'm just saying.
[5646.33s -> 5648.68s]  I didn't want to have anybody.
[5648.68s -> 5649.52s]  You're making it worse.
[5649.52s -> 5650.34s]  This is a self-report.
[5650.34s -> 5651.18s]  No, it's not.
[5651.18s -> 5659.93s]  I'm watching porn in a hotel room.
[5659.93s -> 5662.61s]  No, I just want to sleep in the hotel room.
[5662.61s -> 5663.45s]  You know what I mean?
[5663.45s -> 5664.27s]  I don't want to do it.
[5664.27s -> 5666.25s]  No.
[5666.25s -> 5669.55s]  I don't want to sit there and just sit there and be like,
[5669.55s -> 5675.47s]  all right, here we go.
[5675.47s -> 5676.55s]  No.
[5676.55s -> 5677.43s]  Jerma, stop.
[5677.43s -> 5678.92s]  You need to act cool.
[5678.92s -> 5679.76s]  Act cool.
[5679.76s -> 5681.20s]  You got to act cool.
[5681.20s -> 5682.04s]  All right, all right.
[5682.04s -> 5682.86s]  I'll act cool.
[5682.86s -> 5688.87s]  All right, I'll act cool.
[5688.87s -> 5689.71s]  Okay.
[5689.71s -> 5690.53s]  Just be cool.
[5690.53s -> 5691.37s]  Be cool.
[5691.37s -> 5692.21s]  It's not a big deal.
[5692.21s -> 5697.62s]  Whatever.
[5697.62s -> 5698.46s]  Be cool.
[5698.46s -> 5699.30s]  This is actually so bad.
[5699.30s -> 5700.12s]  No, it's not.
[5701.00s -> 5702.68s]  We made a couple of comments
[5702.68s -> 5705.88s]  about late night telephone sex lines
[5705.88s -> 5709.84s]  and all of a sudden I buy porn every time I go to the hotel.
[5709.84s -> 5711.68s]  That's you doing that.
[5711.68s -> 5714.12s]  That's you putting that on me.
[5714.12s -> 5715.72s]  We never talked about that.
[5715.72s -> 5718.26s]  We literally never talked about that.
[5718.26s -> 5720.82s]  I made a quick comment about this
[5720.82s -> 5723.78s]  and it became literally what I do every day.
[5723.78s -> 5728.55s]  Lewis Kennedy.
[5728.55s -> 5732.88s]  Jerma watches porn and gets naked.
[5732.88s -> 5733.72s]  Yeah.
[5733.72s -> 5734.56s]  No, no.
[5734.56s -> 5737.72s]  I get naked because I have to go take a shower and get naked.
[5737.72s -> 5738.64s]  I'm done with this conversation.
[5738.64s -> 5740.28s]  Put it in emote only mode right now.
[5740.28s -> 5741.40s]  Put it in emote only mode.
[5741.40s -> 5744.16s]  I demand emote only mode right now.
[5744.16s -> 5755.50s]  Emotes only for an hour.
[5755.50s -> 5756.42s]  Lewis Kennedy.
[5756.42s -> 5757.26s]  All right.
[5757.26s -> 5758.30s]  You never heard of Lewis Kennedy.
[5758.30s -> 5759.54s]  That's fine.
[5759.54s -> 5761.84s]  Anybody else here?
[5761.84s -> 5773.88s]  Can I play this?
[5773.88s -> 5777.00s]  You look just like her.
[5777.00s -> 5777.84s]  Who?
[5777.84s -> 5778.84s]  Same eyes.
[5778.84s -> 5779.92s]  I'm telling you it's me.
[5779.92s -> 5780.92s]  Same hair.
[5780.92s -> 5781.76s]  It's me.
[5781.76s -> 5788.11s]  She used to be so beautiful,
[5788.11s -> 5791.15s]  but I've lost her.
[5791.15s -> 5794.93s]  It's been so long now.
[5794.93s -> 5797.40s]  Oh, did you know one of the girls
[5797.40s -> 5808.64s]  who went missing around here, ma'am?
[5808.64s -> 5813.73s]  Oh, and by the way, let me just make this really clear.
[5813.73s -> 5816.43s]  It's 2022.
[5816.43s -> 5820.25s]  If you've consumed pornographic material,
[5820.25s -> 5822.93s]  this isn't like 1902 where it's like,
[5822.93s -> 5826.25s]  oh no, nobody's consumed, how dare you, the devil.
[5826.25s -> 5828.77s]  Now, who really gives a shit?
[5828.77s -> 5830.21s]  Who really gives a shit?
[5830.21s -> 5834.60s]  If you watch porn movies in the hotel room,
[5834.60s -> 5836.88s]  I don't care.
[5838.51s -> 5844.90s]  Who cares?
[5844.90s -> 5846.54s]  I don't give a shit if you're watching porn
[5846.54s -> 5848.66s]  in your hotel room, but what the fuck do I care?
[5848.66s -> 5850.06s]  It has nothing to do with me.
[5856.15s -> 5865.41s]  I'm glad that got sniped, and I'm glad it did.
[5865.41s -> 5889.49s]  My fingers are so, ugh.
[5889.49s -> 5900.99s]  I'm going to take it off of emote-only mode in 10 seconds.
[5900.99s -> 5907.73s]  I want strict behavior.
[5907.73s -> 5908.97s]  Doing a late night walk.
[5908.97s -> 5909.81s]  First one.
[5909.81s -> 5911.13s]  That's girl, but what?
[5911.13s -> 5911.97s]  I don't know if-
[5911.97s -> 5914.16s]  Okay, we want behavior.
[5914.16s -> 5917.48s]  I want you on your best behavior.
[5917.48s -> 5919.04s]  There could be a sponsor watching.
[5919.04s -> 5920.16s]  You never know.
[5920.16s -> 5922.44s]  There could be a sponsor watching.
[5922.44s -> 5926.84s]  How would you, there could be somebody from, I don't know.
[5926.84s -> 5929.19s]  You never know, I gotta be careful.
[5929.19s -> 5931.82s]  We'll talk about that anymore.
[5931.82s -> 5936.37s]  All right, so is my clothes done?
[5936.37s -> 5939.75s]  I just keep getting derailed.
[5939.75s -> 5942.07s]  I think this game is like a 40 minute experience,
[5942.07s -> 5948.42s]  and I just keep getting so derailed.
[5948.42s -> 5950.62s]  What about the, maybe P-Paw?
[5950.62s -> 5966.63s]  Yeah, I'll go talk to P-Paw.
[5966.63s -> 5970.00s]  Old Louis was a real son of a bitch.
[5970.00s -> 5973.44s]  Had a real eye for the younger girls he did.
[5973.44s -> 5977.00s]  Don't mean to gossip, but I have it on good authority.
[5977.00s -> 5980.20s]  He was the one who knocked up that poor girl
[5980.20s -> 5981.84s]  who worked for him.
[5981.84s -> 5983.64s]  Can't remember her name,
[5984.20s -> 5986.52s]  but between that scandal, the fire,
[5986.52s -> 5988.96s]  and then the disappearances,
[5988.96s -> 5992.16s]  I would say all the details will never be known.
[5994.17s -> 6008.90s]  Okay, I don't know why.
[6008.90s -> 6011.40s]  I just thought it would be like kind of funny.
[6011.40s -> 6014.61s]  Remember Supermarket Sweep?
[6014.61s -> 6017.01s]  Imagine they did like a supermarket sweep type thing
[6017.01s -> 6019.03s]  with like a video store.
[6019.03s -> 6021.91s]  And it was the person, the contestant got to the end.
[6021.91s -> 6023.51s]  It was like, okay, you gotta go through each aisle
[6023.51s -> 6027.16s]  and you gotta get as many DVDs as you want.
[6027.16s -> 6029.44s]  Any shelf, anything that you care about, right?
[6029.44s -> 6030.40s]  And the music starts and it's like,
[6030.40s -> 6031.60s]  all right, let's go.
[6033.80s -> 6035.64s]  They fucking sprint into this room
[6035.64s -> 6038.46s]  and just start sliding their hand into the cart.
[6038.46s -> 6040.26s]  Just filling it with all these porns.
[6040.26s -> 6042.37s]  And they don't even touch anything else.
[6042.37s -> 6044.05s]  And after five straight minutes, they come out of here
[6044.05s -> 6048.04s]  with like a cart full of just porn DVDs.
[6048.04s -> 6048.88s]  And everyone just sitting there like,
[6048.88s -> 6051.66s]  what the fuck?
[6051.66s -> 6052.94s]  Don't go in there.
[6052.94s -> 6054.67s]  I, whatever.
[6054.67s -> 6058.15s]  He looks like a shrimp.
[6058.15s -> 6058.97s]  Me?
[6058.97s -> 6063.67s]  Like, wait, the animal, the shrimp.
[6063.67s -> 6068.56s]  What does the shrimp's face look like?
[6068.56s -> 6075.36s]  There's blood on this?
[6075.36s -> 6076.52s]  Gross, okay.
[6092.11s -> 6095.87s]  Can I just read you a portion of my modding chat?
[6097.63s -> 6098.99s]  This is from VR Josh.
[6098.99s -> 6101.84s]  This is very important.
[6101.84s -> 6102.68s]  Thumbs up.
[6102.68s -> 6105.54s]  Emote only mode enabled.
[6105.54s -> 6107.44s]  I'm not gonna read that one, next one.
[6107.44s -> 6108.68s]  I'm ready, LOL.
[6108.68s -> 6110.44s]  Okay, emote only coming off.
[6110.44s -> 6112.95s]  I'm gonna block the word porn.
[6112.95s -> 6118.25s]  Nevermind.
[6118.25s -> 6119.82s]  They're trying.
[6119.82s -> 6121.64s]  They're trying, guys.
[6121.64s -> 6123.80s]  They're trying.
[6123.80s -> 6125.48s]  Did I already show this?
[6125.48s -> 6126.48s]  Did I already show you this?
[6126.48s -> 6133.60s]  That is, but he sounds like a real asshole to me.
[6133.60s -> 6140.05s]  Okay.
[6140.05s -> 6141.21s]  I think that's pretty much it.
[6141.21s -> 6145.57s]  There's nobody else to talk to, right?
[6145.57s -> 6147.30s]  Is there another store over here?
[6147.30s -> 6152.27s]  What is the car that was in front of the bus stop?
[6152.27s -> 6161.07s]  Yeah, that's the bus stop car.
[6161.07s -> 6164.39s]  Do I look like a shrimp?
[6164.39s -> 6167.77s]  Let me see.
[6167.77s -> 6169.24s]  What does a shrimp look like?
[6169.24s -> 6172.73s]  I know what they look like, but do I look a little bit?
[6172.73s -> 6174.92s]  What animal do I look like?
[6174.92s -> 6176.95s]  All right, mods, run a poll.
[6176.95s -> 6177.79s]  I want you to run a poll
[6177.79s -> 6183.12s]  and I want you to put 10 of sort of the most iconic animals.
[6183.16s -> 6184.12s]  I don't want people to vote
[6184.12s -> 6192.63s]  on what animal they think I look like.
[6198.24s -> 6200.80s]  I need a code for that lock box.
[6213.85s -> 6215.05s]  Can I break this?
[6215.05s -> 6219.44s]  What do I do with this doll head?
[6219.44s -> 6222.20s]  Polls only have five options.
[6222.20s -> 6232.83s]  Oh, nevermind.
[6232.83s -> 6234.27s]  So what do I do?
[6234.27s -> 6238.87s]  Is my clothes not done drying yet?
[6238.87s -> 6242.91s]  Maybe they are.
[6242.91s -> 6245.82s]  No, they're not done.
[6245.82s -> 6246.76s]  Oh, there it is.
[6246.76s -> 6247.94s]  What the hell?
[6247.94s -> 6249.72s]  These clothes are still wet.
[6249.72s -> 6250.84s]  This machine must be broken,
[6250.84s -> 6252.96s]  but those were my last quarters.
[6252.96s -> 6257.25s]  Where's that employee?
[6258.09s -> 6261.48s]  Excuse me.
[6261.48s -> 6267.13s]  Excuse me.
[6267.13s -> 6269.95s]  Where are you?
[6269.95s -> 6274.02s]  Hello?
[6274.02s -> 6275.34s]  Get up.
[6275.34s -> 6284.56s]  There's blood.
[6284.56s -> 6285.96s]  What are you doing in here?
[6285.96s -> 6287.08s]  Doing a late night wash.
[6287.08s -> 6287.92s]  Yeah.
[6287.92s -> 6288.76s]  First one.
[6288.76s -> 6289.58s]  That's girl.
[6289.58s -> 6290.42s]  But what?
[6290.42s -> 6294.13s]  I heard.
[6294.13s -> 6294.95s]  Well.
[6294.95s -> 6296.73s]  What do you have to say about this?
[6296.73s -> 6301.16s]  Not my kind of doll, if you know what I mean.
[6301.16s -> 6302.60s]  You read these?
[6302.60s -> 6303.64s]  I don't need to ask him about this.
[6303.64s -> 6305.07s]  Okay.
[6305.07s -> 6316.00s]  So what's going on?
[6316.00s -> 6317.60s]  What?
[6317.60s -> 6320.32s]  Oh, it's the employee.
[6320.32s -> 6322.96s]  He's been ripped to shreds.
[6322.96s -> 6338.40s]  I need to call the police.
[6338.40s -> 6347.66s]  Shit.
[6347.66s -> 6351.71s]  You watched porn at the Holiday Inn and got caught.
[6351.71s -> 6357.09s]  That's very specific.
[6357.09s -> 6359.71s]  Why are you still on that?
[6359.71s -> 6360.55s]  Hello?
[6360.55s -> 6361.99s]  Somebody just fell from the ceiling.
[6361.99s -> 6362.83s]  You need to send someone now.
[6362.83s -> 6363.65s]  I'm at the...
[6363.65s -> 6365.43s]  Somebody fell from the ceiling covered in blood
[6365.43s -> 6367.17s]  and they were like ripped up.
[6367.17s -> 6369.95s]  And you're still on the dude you got caught
[6369.95s -> 6373.88s]  at the Holiday Inn back a year or two ago or something.
[6373.88s -> 6380.42s]  We're trying to play a game.
[6380.42s -> 6382.30s]  Shit.
[6382.30s -> 6383.56s]  20 minutes later.
[6386.27s -> 6389.75s]  20 minutes later.
[6389.75s -> 6393.53s]  Dispatch said they got a call coming from out here,
[6393.53s -> 6397.29s]  but it's strange.
[6397.29s -> 6399.77s]  Don't give them specific timeframes.
[6399.77s -> 6402.69s]  I'm just, I'm getting in their mindset.
[6402.69s -> 6407.13s]  I can't seem to be able to find anyone.
[6407.13s -> 6410.73s]  Where is this person talking?
[6410.73s -> 6411.73s]  There's no body in here?
[6411.73s -> 6418.00s]  What?
[6418.00s -> 6418.82s]  They don't know.
[6418.82s -> 6419.96s]  What do you mean?
[6419.96s -> 6422.65s]  I'd be a rodent.
[6422.65s -> 6425.28s]  I don't know if I'd be a rodent.
[6425.28s -> 6430.47s]  I think I'm more of a lion.
[6430.47s -> 6434.65s]  Is that someone crying?
[6434.65s -> 6436.57s]  It sounds like it's coming from that office
[6436.57s -> 6442.94s]  by the pizza place.
[6442.94s -> 6444.98s]  Well, you're a police officer.
[6444.98s -> 6451.82s]  Go look.
[6451.82s -> 6452.66s]  I hate this.
[6452.66s -> 6453.72s]  I hate this.
[6453.72s -> 6455.18s]  Go look in there.
[6455.18s -> 6458.52s]  Go look in there.
[6458.52s -> 6462.32s]  All I have is I have a key for a weapon.
[6462.32s -> 6463.44s]  I'm the police officer.
[6463.44s -> 6466.86s]  What are you?
[6466.86s -> 6469.69s]  Oh, I'm the officer.
[6469.69s -> 6476.50s]  Oh.
[6476.50s -> 6487.64s]  The office by the pizza place?
[6487.64s -> 6492.34s]  Oh, it's just somebody that has to do the taxes.
[6492.34s -> 6506.98s]  Yeah, I get upset every fucking April 10th as well.
[6506.98s -> 6509.26s]  Is anyone there?
[6509.26s -> 6510.54s]  That was a boomer joke.
[6510.54s -> 6511.38s]  That's fine.
[6511.38s -> 6513.03s]  This is the police.
[6513.03s -> 6517.60s]  If anyone is there, then come out now.
[6517.60s -> 6521.19s]  There's something wrong here.
[6521.19s -> 6525.76s]  Investigate thoroughly.
[6525.76s -> 6532.24s]  Oh, God.
[6532.24s -> 6543.86s]  Business plan, computer, doesn't look suspicious.
[6543.86s -> 6552.66s]  Binders, copy machine, water cooler.
[6556.88s -> 6557.88s]  The TV got worse.
[6557.88s -> 6566.47s]  It's hard to see.
[6566.47s -> 6570.71s]  Fuck off.
[6570.71s -> 6572.39s]  If you, I found if you sniff in,
[6572.39s -> 6573.75s]  when you think a jump scare is gonna happen,
[6573.75s -> 6595.62s]  it scares you less.
[6595.62s -> 6596.46s]  Yeah.
[6596.46s -> 6597.28s]  Yeah.
[6597.28s -> 6598.12s]  Yeah.
[6598.12s -> 6599.33s]  Yeah.
[6599.33s -> 6601.22s]  Yeah.
[6601.22s -> 6605.18s]  Yeah.
[6605.18s -> 6606.02s]  Yeah.
[6606.02s -> 6606.84s]  Yeah.
[6606.84s -> 6607.68s]  Yeah.
[6607.68s -> 6608.52s]  Yeah.
[6608.52s -> 6609.34s]  Yeah.
[6609.34s -> 6610.18s]  Yeah.
[6610.18s -> 6611.02s]  Yeah.
[6611.02s -> 6611.84s]  Yeah.
[6611.84s -> 6612.68s]  Yeah.
[6612.68s -> 6613.52s]  Yeah.
[6613.52s -> 6614.90s]  Yeah.
[6614.90s -> 6615.74s]  Yeah.
[6615.74s -> 6616.58s]  Yeah.
[6616.58s -> 6617.40s]  Yeah.
[6617.40s -> 6618.24s]  Yeah.
[6618.24s -> 6619.08s]  Yeah.
[6619.08s -> 6619.90s]  Yeah.
[6619.90s -> 6623.48s]  How many bolts do I have?
[6623.48s -> 6624.32s]  An infinite amount.
[6624.32s -> 6638.05s]  Good.
[6638.05s -> 6654.04s]  Office key.
[6654.04s -> 6654.88s]  That's so bad.
[6654.88s -> 6668.26s]  I wanna press G and throw a grenade down the hall.
[6668.26s -> 6669.10s]  Get the key.
[6669.10s -> 6669.94s]  Get the key.
[6669.94s -> 6671.83s]  Get the key out, man.
[6672.47s -> 6673.31s]  Where's my key?
[6673.31s -> 6675.16s]  I got an office key.
[6675.16s -> 6676.00s]  Officer.
[6676.00s -> 6677.84s]  Oh, that's an office, Burton.
[6677.84s -> 6678.76s]  Burton's office.
[6678.76s -> 6679.60s]  Locked.
[6679.60s -> 6680.42s]  I can find a key.
[6680.42s -> 6682.20s]  What is this?
[6682.20s -> 6694.22s]  Is that where I can't, how do I get it?
[6694.22s -> 6699.01s]  The door is stuck.
[6699.01s -> 6700.09s]  Why do I get my key out?
[6700.09s -> 6704.38s]  Turn on a flashlight?
[6704.38s -> 6706.30s]  What do you mean turn?
[6706.30s -> 6707.98s]  I don't, I need, where's my key?
[6707.98s -> 6710.34s]  I just picked one up.
[6710.34s -> 6711.18s]  Door is stuck.
[6711.18s -> 6712.00s]  Door is stuck.
[6712.00s -> 6714.23s]  Door is stuck.
[6714.23s -> 6717.65s]  But I got a key to the office, didn't I?
[6717.65s -> 6721.16s]  Locked.
[6721.16s -> 6722.50s]  It's tab, isn't it?
[6722.50s -> 6733.81s]  There's no scroll.
[6733.81s -> 6734.65s]  Where do I get it?
[6734.65s -> 6740.54s]  Press I.
[6740.54s -> 6743.84s]  I picked it up, didn't I?
[6743.84s -> 6744.68s]  I don't get it.
[6744.68s -> 6745.52s]  Yeah, I have it.
[6748.63s -> 6749.47s]  What is it?
[6749.47s -> 6757.19s]  Look at the fire extinguisher.
[6757.19s -> 6758.03s]  Where, I don't get it.
[6758.03s -> 6760.67s]  Press one, two, three, four.
[6760.67s -> 6761.59s]  Press the key button.
[6761.59s -> 6767.17s]  Usually I just hit tab and I have an inventory.
[6767.17s -> 6769.83s]  I don't understand what's happening here.
[6769.83s -> 6770.67s]  It's one.
[6770.67s -> 6778.86s]  It's not one.
[6778.86s -> 6781.19s]  It even says I need a key.
[6781.19s -> 6782.29s]  Is it bugged?
[6782.29s -> 6786.14s]  Right click.
[6786.14s -> 6786.98s]  Locked.
[6786.98s -> 6787.82s]  What the fuck?
[6787.82s -> 6789.22s]  Scroll with the gun out.
[6789.22s -> 6817.29s]  Oh, come on, Gwyn.
[6817.29s -> 6833.09s]  What?
[6833.09s -> 6833.93s]  Oh my God.
[6833.93s -> 6834.77s]  You gotta help me.
[6834.77s -> 6835.59s]  Slow down.
[6835.59s -> 6836.43s]  It's okay.
[6836.43s -> 6847.66s]  Just follow me.
[6847.66s -> 6848.62s]  Fire!
[6848.62s -> 6852.13s]  Fire!
[6852.13s -> 6854.68s]  Fire!
[6854.68s -> 6855.64s]  What happened?
[6857.64s -> 6858.48s]  What?
[6858.48s -> 6859.81s]  Okay, go.
[6859.81s -> 6866.51s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[6866.51s -> 6867.39s]  I didn't mean to do that.
[6867.39s -> 6875.47s]  I'm too jumpy today.
[6875.47s -> 6877.76s]  I wanna say at this point, I don't give a shit.
[6877.76s -> 6879.32s]  I'm gonna turn the corner and...
[6879.32s -> 6880.16s]  Yeah.
[6880.16s -> 6883.10s]  Yeah.
[6883.10s -> 6883.92s]  I don't care.
[6883.92s -> 6884.76s]  I'm gonna turn the corner.
[6884.76s -> 6885.60s]  Someone's gonna go, wait!
[6885.60s -> 6887.95s]  And I'm gonna...
[6887.95s -> 6888.79s]  You know what I mean?
[6888.79s -> 6898.30s]  In those old like shooter games.
[6898.30s -> 6925.68s]  What are you talking about?
[6925.68s -> 6926.52s]  I didn't get them.
[6926.52s -> 6928.86s]  I was shooting every two steps.
[6928.86s -> 6933.64s]  And the one step that I don't shoot, I get killed.
[6933.64s -> 6935.27s]  No one's coming.
[6935.27s -> 6936.63s]  Maybe I can make a run for it.
[6953.78s -> 6971.68s]  Fucking smashing.
[6971.68s -> 6986.24s]  In that receipt.
[6986.24s -> 6988.98s]  It's a receipt for a building repair company.
[6988.98s -> 6990.92s]  Looks like they had to repair one of the walls in the...
[6990.92s -> 6993.52s]  Oh.
[6993.52s -> 6996.01s]  Okay.
[6996.01s -> 6998.87s]  I can smash the wall with a hammer.
[6998.87s -> 6999.71s]  Without a doubt.
[7003.66s -> 7011.28s]  God damn it.
[7011.28s -> 7014.40s]  My clothes done.
[7014.40s -> 7031.27s]  What the fuck are you doing?
[7031.27s -> 7033.48s]  What?
[7034.62s -> 7035.46s]  What?
[7035.46s -> 7043.20s]  Cradle at baby is drowsing.
[7043.36s -> 7044.84s]  Who is doing that?
[7044.84s -> 7049.69s]  Are they in the washing machine?
[7050.57s -> 7051.41s]  Discord Mike?
[7055.14s -> 7055.98s]  I don't know.
[7055.98s -> 7057.94s]  We're just gonna get out of here quick.
[7057.94s -> 7060.67s]  There's a door behind here.
[7060.67s -> 7078.19s]  Get out, get out, get out, get out.
[7078.19s -> 7079.03s]  Grenade.
[7079.03s -> 7085.53s]  No.
[7085.53s -> 7090.64s]  Do I hide?
[7090.64s -> 7091.48s]  Do I, where do I go?
[7091.48s -> 7092.30s]  Do I hide in here?
[7092.30s -> 7094.34s]  An event?
[7094.34s -> 7109.74s]  Leave.
[7109.74s -> 7110.58s]  No!
[7113.79s -> 7119.78s]  Fuck you.
[7119.78s -> 7122.58s]  Newspaper.
[7122.58s -> 7127.33s]  Main suspect in police investigation disappears.
[7127.33s -> 7129.69s]  45 year old Lewis Kennedy has gone missing.
[7129.69s -> 7131.49s]  The top suspect in the grisly crime
[7131.49s -> 7134.31s]  of an arson alleged kidnapping.
[7134.31s -> 7136.31s]  What the fuck?
[7136.35s -> 7138.03s]  Sources say that Kennedy had been under surveillance
[7138.03s -> 7139.75s]  for a few weeks and at some point of the course
[7139.75s -> 7142.65s]  of last night had broken contact with officers.
[7142.65s -> 7149.19s]  That was a centipede scream?
[7149.19s -> 7151.19s]  The audio did something really weird to your voice.
[7151.19s -> 7154.44s]  Can I hear, let me hear it.
[7154.44s -> 7157.68s]  Take less cocaine next time.
[7157.68s -> 7161.75s]  Let me hear this.
[7161.75s -> 7167.96s]  Let me see, I need to know what this sounds like.
[7167.96s -> 7172.72s]  How bad does it sound?
[7176.39s -> 7183.76s]  That's so weird.
[7183.76s -> 7186.80s]  Fuck, it sounds like it's in a different room.
[7186.80s -> 7188.16s]  So what doesn't sound like that right now?
[7188.16s -> 7192.42s]  It's only when I get loud?
[7192.42s -> 7193.66s]  It sounds like I have like,
[7193.66s -> 7197.78s]  it sounds like I'm yelling into my hands.
[7197.78s -> 7203.28s]  It doesn't sound like that right now, right?
[7203.28s -> 7212.01s]  It sounds like a Diablo II death sound.
[7212.01s -> 7213.01s]  It really does.
[7229.72s -> 7236.57s]  It sounds like a fucking Diablo II death.
[7236.57s -> 7239.37s]  But what's missing is me slamming the desk
[7239.37s -> 7243.55s]  and going, what the fuck, dude?
[7243.55s -> 7244.79s]  It's trying to filter out anything
[7244.79s -> 7251.00s]  that it's a noise that humans don't normally make.
[7251.00s -> 7252.56s]  I don't know, I try to fix it,
[7252.56s -> 7259.88s]  but I don't know what the fuck is going on there, man.
[7259.88s -> 7262.18s]  That's so fucking dumb.
[7262.18s -> 7268.19s]  Sounds like an old Mortal Kombat attack.
[7268.19s -> 7274.82s]  It does, it really does.
[7274.82s -> 7278.55s]  Like Mortal Kombat on the Sega Genesis.
[7278.55s -> 7296.68s]  Okay, okay, I'm gonna fucking freak out.
[7296.68s -> 7299.96s]  AC unit, it won't open.
[7299.96s -> 7308.34s]  Flashlight, how do I turn it on?
[7308.34s -> 7317.60s]  F for flashlight?
[7319.60s -> 7321.80s]  Oh, hey, fuck, hey, I don't wanna look this way.
[7321.80s -> 7324.94s]  I wanna run away.
[7324.94s -> 7326.94s]  It won't budge, what do you mean it won't budge?
[7326.94s -> 7329.26s]  Hide somewhere, hide in the filing cabinet or something.
[7329.26s -> 7331.13s]  Hide in the filing cabinet.
[7331.13s -> 7332.45s]  Hide over here.
[7332.45s -> 7335.07s]  Go this way, turn on the flashlight.
[7336.51s -> 7337.52s]  Yikes.
[7338.44s -> 7344.04s]  Oh, like, oh, no.
[7344.04s -> 7346.20s]  Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[7346.20s -> 7362.61s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, a scalpel.
[7362.61s -> 7363.97s]  I thought that was my face.
[7363.97s -> 7367.53s]  I thought that was an emote of my face.
[7367.53s -> 7372.62s]  I know I won't be getting out of here alive.
[7372.62s -> 7375.66s]  That psychopath, it kills women like me.
[7375.66s -> 7379.36s]  I've heard at least three of those brought here and killed.
[7379.36s -> 7380.44s]  Peeking through the cracks I saw
[7380.44s -> 7384.00s]  that it creates these masks out of skin.
[7384.00s -> 7387.30s]  Whoa, I don't know what kind of game it's wanting to play.
[7387.30s -> 7388.94s]  I think my time is up.
[7388.94s -> 7390.22s]  It made me swallow a key,
[7390.22s -> 7392.10s]  a key that I think would get me out of here,
[7392.10s -> 7393.74s]  but I have a feeling it won't let me live long enough
[7393.74s -> 7394.74s]  to use it.
[7394.74s -> 7407.13s]  I'll be struggling butchered like the rest.
[7407.13s -> 7411.84s]  Ah, where are you?
[7411.84s -> 7413.36s]  I know that this is this person over here.
[7413.36s -> 7416.04s]  This is gonna burn me.
[7416.04s -> 7422.59s]  Yeah, you, I got a scalpel and I got, there's a key.
[7422.59s -> 7423.63s]  I can't believe I'm doing this.
[7423.63s -> 7426.04s]  I got a key to get out of here.
[7426.04s -> 7427.40s]  All right, all right, all right, all right.
[7427.40s -> 7428.24s]  Give me that key.
[7428.24s -> 7430.20s]  All right, all right, all right, all right, all right.
[7430.20s -> 7436.63s]  Just, I'm gonna hold this out and run.
[7436.63s -> 7437.67s]  Oh, he's gonna be in this door.
[7437.67s -> 7438.55s]  He's gonna break through this door.
[7438.55s -> 7439.39s]  I know it.
[7439.39s -> 7440.23s]  He's gonna break through the door.
[7440.23s -> 7444.88s]  He's gonna, he's gonna break out the door.
[7444.88s -> 7463.04s]  Wrong key.
[7463.04s -> 7470.47s]  Is that, who's that?
[7470.47s -> 7472.25s]  Corpse.
[7472.25s -> 7475.64s]  Corpse, been here for years.
[7475.64s -> 7478.40s]  There's a wallet sticking out of his pocket.
[7478.40s -> 7479.24s]  Who is it?
[7479.24s -> 7480.51s]  What?
[7480.51s -> 7483.14s]  The driver's license belongs to Lewis Kennedy.
[7483.14s -> 7485.26s]  This doesn't make any sense.
[7485.26s -> 7490.77s]  I need to get out of here and call the police.
[7490.77s -> 7492.31s]  There's a, what?
[7492.31s -> 7493.60s]  There's a, what?
[7493.60s -> 7495.80s]  No, I don't wanna get out of here.
[7495.80s -> 7510.80s]  How do I get out of here?
[7510.80s -> 7523.72s]  Oh, oh, person, Scoob.
[7524.24s -> 7527.16s]  Rocky, we need to get out of here.
[7527.16s -> 7528.80s]  Like, I agree, Scoob.
[7528.80s -> 7530.20s]  Let's skedaddle.
[7533.42s -> 7545.26s]  Rocky, we need to get out of here.
[7545.26s -> 7555.03s]  Find the child.
[7555.03s -> 7558.62s]  Oh, by the way, speaking of those two,
[7558.62s -> 7563.48s]  I have access to the Multiversus Early Alpha.
[7563.48s -> 7566.55s]  I was thinking about playing it on stream at some point.
[7566.55s -> 7567.59s]  Just letting you know.
[7567.59s -> 7572.12s]  I have access to it and that could be pretty fun
[7572.12s -> 7576.52s]  if we were to do it eventually.
[7576.52s -> 7579.94s]  Can I go through here?
[7579.94s -> 7589.15s]  I need to get this lock off.
[7589.19s -> 7590.03s]  What was that?
[7590.03s -> 7591.03s]  I don't know.
[7591.03s -> 7592.19s]  I don't know, I don't know.
[7592.19s -> 7595.93s]  I don't know what it is.
[7595.93s -> 7600.24s]  I don't know.
[7600.24s -> 7605.87s]  I don't know.
[7605.87s -> 7624.55s]  I don't know.
[7624.55s -> 7633.61s]  What was that?
[7633.61s -> 7636.86s]  Ammo.
[7636.86s -> 7638.78s]  I have ammo?
[7638.78s -> 7639.96s]  Okay, I've got ammo.
[7639.96s -> 7651.03s]  I don't know.
[7651.03s -> 7660.81s]  You're gonna be right here, aren't you?
[7660.81s -> 7677.51s]  Wait!
[7677.51s -> 7685.22s]  Gun.
[7685.22s -> 7687.24s]  How many bullets does this have?
[7687.24s -> 7689.71s]  I'm afraid to shoot it.
[7689.71s -> 7693.90s]  How do I turn the flashlight on?
[7693.90s -> 7702.66s]  It's so hard to see.
[7702.66s -> 7704.46s]  Oh, there's so many warships.
[7704.46s -> 7709.12s]  Gosh, there's so many washing machines down here, Mickey.
[7709.12s -> 7710.72s]  Of course there is, Goofy.
[7710.72s -> 7726.21s]  That's where they do their laundry.
[7726.21s -> 7728.83s]  That was a bad bit.
[7728.83s -> 7736.11s]  I'm not doing a bit.
[7736.11s -> 7737.83s]  Come out, you asshole.
[7737.83s -> 7743.00s]  I'm ready for you.
[7743.00s -> 7744.93s]  Why would you do that?
[7744.93s -> 7746.37s]  Don't say that.
[7746.37s -> 7747.77s]  You need to...
[7747.77s -> 7748.73s]  Actually, you know what?
[7748.73s -> 7751.11s]  This is what I'd do.
[7751.11s -> 7754.13s]  I'd say, like, come get me, motherfucker.
[7754.13s -> 7755.41s]  Like, I'm here, I'm waiting for you.
[7755.41s -> 7757.45s]  And then I would throw something over there
[7757.45s -> 7760.29s]  and be like, ow, my knee, ow!
[7760.29s -> 7762.26s]  I'd be like, ow, my knee!
[7762.26s -> 7763.10s]  And then they'd think, holy shit,
[7763.10s -> 7766.10s]  he must have fallen down and gotten hit.
[7766.10s -> 7772.35s]  And then he'd go on over there.
[7772.35s -> 7796.35s]  There's a person right there.
[7796.35s -> 7797.19s]  Oh!
[7797.19s -> 7800.32s]  Oh!
[7800.32s -> 7802.14s]  Oh!
[7802.14s -> 7808.92s]  Oh!
[7808.92s -> 7809.76s]  Where's my flashlight?
[7809.76s -> 7815.70s]  Oh my God, I can't see anything.
[7815.74s -> 7834.16s]  Oh my God, I can't see.
[7834.16s -> 7840.32s]  Whoa!
[7840.32s -> 7845.80s]  That was like, that sounds like my mic.
[7845.80s -> 7849.67s]  Why can't I move?
[7849.67s -> 7850.99s]  All right, I'm just gonna...
[7850.99s -> 7854.57s]  What the...
[7854.57s -> 7855.39s]  Oh!
[7855.39s -> 7862.16s]  Oh!
[7862.16s -> 7863.00s]  Oh!
[7863.00s -> 7863.84s]  What the fuck, dude?
[7863.84s -> 7864.68s]  Oh!
[7864.68s -> 7866.92s]  Oh!
[7866.92s -> 7867.76s]  Oh!
[7867.76s -> 7874.60s]  Oh!
[7874.60s -> 7875.78s]  What's wrong with my mic?
[7875.78s -> 7876.66s]  What are you guys talking about?
[7876.66s -> 7878.16s]  Something wrong with my mic?
[7878.16s -> 7884.13s]  It's fucked up?
[7884.13s -> 7898.69s]  What's wrong?
[7898.69s -> 7899.53s]  What the fuck?
[7899.53s -> 7905.39s]  What the fuck?
[7905.39s -> 7906.23s]  This game's not even fucking scary.
[7906.23s -> 7911.60s]  It's fucking easy.
[7911.60s -> 7913.79s]  That'll make sense now.
[7913.79s -> 7920.38s]  Lewis Kennedy wasn't killing all those women.
[7920.42s -> 7921.54s]  You sound all muffled.
[7921.54s -> 7922.38s]  I don't know why.
[7922.38s -> 7924.85s]  I think the microphone is freaking out
[7924.85s -> 7926.80s]  when I hit a certain level,
[7926.80s -> 7929.61s]  because I sound completely normal right now.
[7929.61s -> 7932.48s]  But when I get to a certain audio level,
[7932.48s -> 7937.92s]  it just muffles me and puts a wall in front of my face.
[7942.95s -> 7944.59s]  The mic keeps freaking out.
[7952.30s -> 7953.14s]  Is it the noise gate?
[7953.14s -> 7954.54s]  I don't think it's on.
[7962.12s -> 7963.68s]  Your mic is trying to smother you
[7963.68s -> 7965.20s]  when you get really loud.
[7965.20s -> 7967.98s]  Scream loud right now.
[7967.98s -> 7970.48s]  Actually, let's find the level, right?
[7970.48s -> 7971.32s]  So like...
[7976.33s -> 7977.33s]  Were those all fine?
[7979.36s -> 7983.37s]  Were those fine?
[7983.37s -> 7984.71s]  Yeah.
[7984.71s -> 7986.17s]  Okay, so...
[7989.21s -> 7991.46s]  What happened?
[7991.46s -> 7997.02s]  What happened to the end there?
[7997.02s -> 7998.92s]  That was fine too.
[7998.92s -> 8004.14s]  Weird.
[8004.14s -> 8004.98s]  I don't know.
[8004.98s -> 8008.77s]  I have to mess with some of the settings.
[8008.77s -> 8012.41s]  She must have lost her baby though.
[8012.41s -> 8014.77s]  With almost being killed, losing her child,
[8014.77s -> 8017.47s]  and being terribly burned.
[8017.47s -> 8019.43s]  Completely snapped.
[8019.43s -> 8022.51s]  Maybe loud, quick loud sounds freak it out.
[8024.88s -> 8028.44s]  I think she has sudden loud sounds.
[8028.44s -> 8031.86s]  That's like half my fucking content.
[8031.86s -> 8034.10s]  She killed Louis,
[8034.10s -> 8037.52s]  and then set her sights on killing others
[8037.52s -> 8040.50s]  who had something she didn't.
[8040.50s -> 8054.64s]  God.
[8054.64s -> 8056.79s]  That was intense.
[8056.79s -> 8062.76s]  That was blood wash.
[8062.76s -> 8064.60s]  Isn't the barf drinker?
[8064.60s -> 8071.36s]  It does kind of look like the barf drinker.
[8071.36s -> 8073.64s]  It turns into a McDonald's mic.
[8073.68s -> 8074.68s]  Eventually, yeah.
[8074.68s -> 8077.95s]  It does.
[8077.95s -> 8078.79s]  That was pretty good.
[8078.79s -> 8079.63s]  That was good.
[8079.63s -> 8084.02s]  That was scary, interesting, creepy.
[8084.02s -> 8087.70s]  I thought that was cool.
[8087.70s -> 8089.82s]  Are you gonna play multiverses?
[8089.82s -> 8092.09s]  I mean, yeah.
[8092.09s -> 8099.67s]  Eventually.
[8099.67s -> 8100.51s]  Wait for the end.
[8100.51s -> 8105.00s]  I'm not gonna skip the after credits.
[8105.00s -> 8107.56s]  Don't act like you were paying attention.
[8107.56s -> 8108.60s]  I was, what do you mean?
[8108.60s -> 8112.12s]  Of course I was.
[8112.12s -> 8116.61s]  What's next after this?
[8116.61s -> 8119.83s]  Hold on a minute, that's really cool.
[8119.83s -> 8123.55s]  So those were custom-made comic books for this game.
[8123.55s -> 8130.32s]  Is that what I'm understanding?
[8130.32s -> 8132.68s]  That's pretty cool.
[8132.68s -> 8141.76s]  Hold on.
[8141.76s -> 8143.12s]  Well, I was pretty upset to be woken up
[8143.12s -> 8146.37s]  so late for an impromptu autopsy,
[8146.37s -> 8149.54s]  but when they told me that it was the actual womb ripper,
[8149.54s -> 8153.43s]  well, I got down here as soon as I could.
[8153.43s -> 8156.23s]  I can't believe that it turned out to be Samantha Rhodes,
[8156.23s -> 8159.55s]  who'd gone missing and was presumed dead years ago.
[8159.55s -> 8160.91s]  So what I did is I do what I do
[8160.91s -> 8164.31s]  with all of these potential serial killer maniacs.
[8164.31s -> 8165.95s]  I stand across the room first,
[8165.95s -> 8167.55s]  even though they're supposed to be dead,
[8167.55s -> 8169.03s]  and I throw a fucking brick
[8169.03s -> 8171.87s]  as fast and as hard as I can at their head
[8171.91s -> 8174.11s]  to make sure that they're not gonna get up and scare me
[8174.11s -> 8198.00s]  and grab me and stab me with a knife.
[8198.00s -> 8199.76s]  The fuse box is down the hall.
[8199.76s -> 8201.63s]  Yeah, great.
[8201.63s -> 8203.43s]  I wonder what happens here.
[8203.43s -> 8208.23s]  You should have threw the brick.
[8208.23s -> 8210.67s]  I mean, like, honestly, it's like, do we need to,
[8210.67s -> 8212.52s]  just, mm-mm.
[8212.52s -> 8217.93s]  Always keep a brick with your, no.
[8217.93s -> 8228.38s]  God damn it, I thought it was over.
[8228.38s -> 8261.24s]  Shut the fuck up.
[8261.24s -> 8262.08s]  No, don't.
[8267.02s -> 8268.22s]  What the, she's gone.
[8268.22s -> 8278.56s]  I have to get out of here.
[8278.56s -> 8280.80s]  Cause of death, multiple gunshot wounds.
[8280.80s -> 8281.92s]  That's the official cause of death,
[8281.92s -> 8283.36s]  but Jesus Christ, I don't even understand
[8283.36s -> 8286.74s]  how she was still alive in the first place.
[8286.74s -> 8288.02s]  I took so many shots to bring her down.
[8288.02s -> 8289.90s]  Most of these look fatal on first glimpse to me.
[8289.90s -> 8303.72s]  Guess we'll dig in to find out more.
[8303.72s -> 8306.16s]  I, okay, well, let's go.
[8309.90s -> 8319.90s]  Oh, how does that, done.
[8319.90s -> 8326.02s]  I'm sorry, but I'm just gonna go right here, right there.
[8326.02s -> 8332.81s]  Just bang.
[8332.81s -> 8346.90s]  You wanna see a fucking, that's fun.
[8346.90s -> 8348.06s]  You should play chess.
[8348.06s -> 8351.83s]  Why would I ever play chess?
[8351.83s -> 8353.86s]  I'm never gonna play chess.
[8353.86s -> 8356.70s]  I, it's too, the game is too high brain for me.
[8356.70s -> 8359.10s]  It's too slow, I need it to be.
[8359.10s -> 8360.42s]  All right, if there was chess,
[8360.42s -> 8364.04s]  where after every move, we got to watch a family guy clip.
[8364.04s -> 8365.72s]  That's just, it just happened.
[8365.72s -> 8374.40s]  Then okay, I'd play it.
[8374.40s -> 8376.36s]  Make the, make a family guy chess.
[8376.36s -> 8378.37s]  And every time I move Peter Griffin,
[8378.37s -> 8383.33s]  he says just a random audio clip from the show.
[8383.33s -> 8386.92s]  It's very clear that they didn't record any new dialogue.
[8386.92s -> 8388.76s]  You move Peter.
[8388.76s -> 8391.07s]  Oh, holy crap, Lois.
[8391.07s -> 8395.45s]  So you didn't record any new audio for this.
[8395.45s -> 8398.24s]  Stewie gets moved, and Stewie just says,
[8398.28s -> 8400.48s]  you can tell he's talking to somebody
[8400.48s -> 8403.40s]  during one of the episodes,
[8403.40s -> 8406.27s]  but it has nothing to do with chess.
[8406.27s -> 8412.42s]  He's on to something.
[8412.42s -> 8413.86s]  No, they know that, that wouldn't happen.
[8413.86s -> 8417.18s]  It wouldn't be, oh, look at me, I'm the king, Lois.
[8417.18s -> 8419.20s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[8419.20s -> 8423.43s]  It would be like a specific, oh, wow.
[8423.43s -> 8425.96s]  I can't believe I became mayor.
[8425.96s -> 8430.07s]  Like, what does that have to do with chess?
[8430.07s -> 8435.42s]  All right, we're gonna go on, we're gonna move on.
[8435.42s -> 8441.60s]  Play checkers, I'm not gonna play checkers.
[8441.60s -> 8443.24s]  All right, I'm gonna take a quick break.
[8443.24s -> 8444.72s]  I'll be right back.
[8444.72s -> 8446.64s]  I'm gonna pee, I'm gonna refill this drink,
[8446.64s -> 8448.40s]  and we're gonna play Murder House.
[8448.40s -> 8450.44s]  That's what's on tap next.
[8450.44s -> 8453.97s]  See you guys in about, I wanna say two minutes,
[8453.97s -> 8455.65s]  maybe a little less.
[8455.65s -> 8457.31s]  We'll find out.
[8457.31s -> 8509.44s]  See you in just a moment.
[8509.44s -> 8512.72s]  Oops, hold on, let me fix it.
