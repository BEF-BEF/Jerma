[0.31s -> 15.57s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerema here with some Facecam Fortress 2, Episode 2, 2, 2.
[15.57s -> 26.30s]  Dead. Nope. This is Episode 2, Facecam Fortress 2. How many times can I say 2 in the same sentence?
[26.30s -> 32.87s]  Alright, let's destroy some people with the Huntsman. What do you say?
[32.87s -> 37.57s]  Playing on Gold Rush, of course.
[37.57s -> 40.57s]  Oh, you moved, you son of a...
[40.57s -> 43.90s]  Come on, thank.
[43.90s -> 46.90s]  No, no, no, no, I don't want to die. Please don't kill me.
[46.90s -> 51.04s]  Shhh, he doesn't know I'm here.
[51.04s -> 56.50s]  Oh, come on. Boing.
[56.50s -> 60.81s]  I need health. Bad. Bad to the bone.
[60.81s -> 69.32s]  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bad. Bad to the bone.
[69.32s -> 75.86s]  Ooh, ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho, big problem.
[75.86s -> 76.86s]  How did that not hit him?
[76.86s -> 81.36s]  I need that health. Get it before the soldier does. What a selfish bastard I am.
[81.36s -> 84.36s]  Wait a minute. You are still alive, probably.
[84.36s -> 87.61s]  I guess not. I guess not.
[87.61s -> 96.40s]  Take that to the bank and cash it.
[96.40s -> 100.77s]  Oh, ho-ho. Oh. Today is a good day to be a Huntsman.
[100.77s -> 105.66s]  Maybe not. Nooooo.
[105.66s -> 110.90s]  Only the good die young. And I was old. So I should have died.
[110.90s -> 119.51s]  Dude, I think it's like a ritual. Whenever I do one of these live commentaries like this, I have to have a cough drop in my mouth.
[119.51s -> 123.01s]  I don't know why. I really don't know.
[123.01s -> 126.08s]  I do the same thing on live streams, too, though.
[126.08s -> 130.82s]  You need that slippery stuff in your throat to make sure you can keep talking.
[130.82s -> 136.21s]  But I think... Oh my god, that guy was right in my face.
[136.21s -> 143.14s]  Give me the health. Give me the health.
[143.14s -> 148.57s]  I should have went for the sniper.
[148.57s -> 151.94s]  Dude, what are you doing, man?
[151.94s -> 158.96s]  Damn it. Get that heavy. Wow.
[158.96s -> 165.02s]  Ah, there we go. I can't believe I missed that heavy.
[165.02s -> 172.14s]  They're gonna get... We had them pushed at spawn, and they're gonna cap it now.
[172.14s -> 175.28s]  Come on, peek your head out. There it is.
[175.28s -> 178.48s]  Peek your head out.
[178.48s -> 182.43s]  Come on, now. Come on, now.
[182.43s -> 191.74s]  Walk into that. Walk into this stuff.
[191.74s -> 196.62s]  I'm just gonna... You know what?
[196.62s -> 200.59s]  Oh, ho-ho. God.
[200.59s -> 205.30s]  Anybody coming around? I don't want to get backstabbed right now.
[205.30s -> 210.06s]  What is my loadout? Peek your head out.
[210.06s -> 215.38s]  Oh, this guy is coming for me.
[215.38s -> 217.38s]  You're coming for me, alright. I can see you.
[217.38s -> 223.39s]  Come on, hit somebody right... Oh, no.
[223.39s -> 228.87s]  No, I should have held it down longer than that.
[228.87s -> 235.36s]  Oh, ho. I need to get health.
[235.36s -> 238.24s]  Need to get that health.
[238.24s -> 242.18s]  Looking right at you. I just like... I sweeped across.
[242.18s -> 247.15s]  That's not... This guy is trying to kill me.
[247.15s -> 250.89s]  I'm just being such a pest.
[250.89s -> 253.77s]  Oh my god, I'm being such a pest.
[253.77s -> 256.78s]  I'm gonna hit that guy in the face.
[256.78s -> 262.22s]  There's one in the face.
[262.22s -> 267.34s]  Maybe I can stay alive the whole round.
[267.34s -> 272.12s]  That would be ideal.
[272.12s -> 275.51s]  Oh, ho. Goodness gracious.
[275.51s -> 281.78s]  I got no more bullets.
[281.78s -> 285.48s]  Um... Maybe I can run over one of them.
[285.48s -> 290.15s]  No, that's a bad idea.
[290.15s -> 293.15s]  I need to get... See, this is the only place I know that's like a close...
[293.15s -> 298.46s]  Thank you! I'll take that.
[298.46s -> 301.41s]  I need the health that's in there, too.
[301.41s -> 307.90s]  Oh... Gotta keep this up.
[307.90s -> 311.89s]  I thought that... Sometimes that happens to you.
[311.89s -> 319.42s]  Two... Give me a three.
[319.42s -> 324.28s]  And I got killed.
[324.28s -> 328.90s]  Dang it!
[328.90s -> 332.90s]  Unless they push forward, I think we're gonna hold the line pretty dang well.
[332.90s -> 334.78s]  What am I using?
[334.78s -> 337.78s]  I do have the razor back on. What if I have...
[337.78s -> 341.41s]  Put the danger shield on.
[341.41s -> 342.41s]  Stick with that.
[342.41s -> 346.74s]  Stick with that, Jack.
[346.74s -> 351.61s]  You better listen, Jack!
[351.61s -> 354.87s]  Who wants to come in the window? Come on.
[354.87s -> 356.87s]  Come on, who wants that doggy in the window?
[356.87s -> 357.87s]  Oh!
[357.87s -> 361.88s]  How much is that doggy in the window?
[361.88s -> 364.12s]  Woof, woof!
[364.12s -> 367.12s]  The one with the waggly tail.
[367.12s -> 369.49s]  I'm stuck on your cart!
[369.49s -> 374.42s]  That was my bank statement!
[374.42s -> 376.72s]  How did that stain get there?
[376.72s -> 379.92s]  Get away from me. I don't want you anymore.
[379.92s -> 388.73s]  See, right at this point right here when the cart is right there...
[388.73s -> 393.46s]  It's pretty damn hard to not die if you're a Huntsman Sniper.
[393.46s -> 395.46s]  Unless you stay all the way back, like back here.
[395.46s -> 396.83s]  And that's what I'm gonna do.
[396.83s -> 399.52s]  There's a headshot, but he doesn't...
[399.52s -> 404.58s]  Aww!
[404.58s -> 408.29s]  Take that, get outta...
[408.29s -> 418.13s]  Can't believe I missed.
[418.13s -> 419.13s]  There's a medic.
[419.13s -> 424.96s]  Nope.
[424.96s -> 426.96s]  I think they actually might win this.
[426.96s -> 435.47s]  It's not looking super, super hot right now for our team.
[435.47s -> 439.12s]  Oh, boy.
[439.12s -> 441.12s]  I'm trying to pull off a little snazzy move right there.
[441.12s -> 448.46s]  Hi, soldier!
[448.46s -> 452.69s]  Mmm...
[452.69s -> 456.66s]  I thought I was gonna get that spy for sure.
[456.66s -> 458.66s]  That's a death wish.
[458.66s -> 461.82s]  I gotta get away from that.
[461.82s -> 465.59s]  That's not a death wish, though.
[465.59s -> 471.03s]  I'm alive!
[471.03s -> 473.03s]  Something about the Huntsman tonight, guys.
[473.03s -> 476.81s]  Something about the Huntsman tonight.
[476.81s -> 483.38s]  Pick your head up.
[485.90s -> 489.00s]  No!
[489.00s -> 492.14s]  Oh, he got me.
[492.14s -> 494.14s]  Should've been more wary about that guy.
[494.14s -> 497.21s]  Wary, wary, hold on.
[497.21s -> 498.21s]  Somebody...
[498.21s -> 502.21s]  I said weary in one of my last videos.
[502.21s -> 506.46s]  And somebody said it's actually wary?
[506.46s -> 507.46s]  I got 49 points right there.
[507.46s -> 509.63s]  Holy crap.
[509.63s -> 512.63s]  So I was wary of the situation.
[512.63s -> 513.87s]  Right?
[513.87s -> 515.87s]  I think.
[515.87s -> 518.87s]  But anyways, that's gonna wrap up this Facecam Fortress 2.
[518.87s -> 519.87s]  Saturday's edition.
[519.87s -> 521.87s]  Go enjoy the sun if it's sunny.
[521.87s -> 530.36s]  If it's rainy, then fruit cup or a hot tea.
[530.36s -> 534.62s]  Some other things you can do when it's not sunny.
[534.62s -> 535.62s]  But yeah, take care, guys.
[535.62s -> 536.62s]  I'll see you all soon.
[536.62s -> 539.62s]  And take care, everybody.
