[0.31s -> 21.94s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with Facecam Fortress 2, playing on Bonblitz as the Scout! Get that Scout! No! Help me!
[21.94s -> 32.68s]  Ooh, thank you Harlow. Thank you. Oh wow, cats, cats, cats, cats. That's a lot of different cats. Oh well. Watch out for the Spy!
[32.68s -> 45.74s]  He's still alive. He's probably going to be right here in a second. No, maybe not. Let's go around. Let's go around up top here.
[45.74s -> 64.21s]  Okay, you're real. You're the real deal. Cool. Let's go! Oh! Oh, get me out of here! Maybe not. Let's go with a Dubb. Dubb Cheeseburger.
[64.21s -> 83.07s]  Who else? Who else? Oh, Heavy? Heavy? Pyro? That guy's going to take mini crits! Goddamn! Oh, good shot. Good shooting, man.
[83.07s -> 99.25s]  We only got to hold this for like four and a half more minutes. Come on, dudes. Server Clearing Sapper. Wow. That's pretty cool. That's a lot of buildings destroyed.
[99.25s -> 110.35s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Medic! Medic! Medic! That guy's going to get the full health kit. Yeah, he is. Oh, you want to go? Oh, you want to do this?
[110.35s -> 124.22s]  Is that a Spy? No, it's not. Alrighty. Just another couple minutes. Yeah, it's just another couple minutes. Wee! Oh, goodness, they know up here.
[124.22s -> 139.16s]  I could just hang out right here for a second. Cover them in the mad milk. Like this guy right here. Oh, I'm missing. Over and over again.
[139.16s -> 153.00s]  And there's a Heavy. Oh, goodness, Heavy. Oh, my God. That guy was like tracking me like a freaking radar gun. Go.
[153.00s -> 168.64s]  All right. I'm about to eat this pretzel stick that's been sitting here for at least three weeks. Gross. Why did I do that?
[168.64s -> 179.80s]  I don't know, but this Spy is still here. Yeah, there he is. There he is. Is there an Uber coming in? No, there's not a Spy, though.
[179.80s -> 191.54s]  Spy? Just... Oh, he's right here. Get out of here. No! No, don't let him get it! I'm going to have to eat another raw pretzel.
[191.54s -> 203.61s]  Come on. Come on, I have faith. I have faith, guys. Come on, get that Heavy. Get him. All right, undercover Spyro. It's up to you, baby.
[203.61s -> 219.71s]  You're going to... Anybody, anybody want to go with the Scout? Grill cheese, baby. Get it before I get hit by the Saw!
[220.71s -> 228.78s]  Oh, I thought that was a Spy. Reverting capture, reverting capture. Don't get hit by the damn saw blade.
[228.78s -> 238.18s]  I'm so scared right now. I'm going to get like backstabbed. No, we're good. Let's cap this thing. We got some... Why does it say five?
[238.18s -> 251.77s]  Oh, there we go. You are a Spy. I could tell. Well, capture the point, capture the point. Get it. Yeah, that's not a Spy.
[253.46s -> 279.22s]  That is a Pyro. And that is... I don't know, I can't even tell. Whoa. Whoa. No, you're real, you're real. Shit. Get him.
[279.22s -> 299.00s]  Now run. Run away. Give me the health. Give me that health, too. Oh, hey, you're a Spy. Any other people here? No.
[299.00s -> 314.03s]  No, don't land on the saw. It will kill you. Oh, run. No. We're playing Scout on Sawmill. I need to re-heal.
[314.03s -> 323.04s]  I need to heal. That's got a Mini-Sentry somewhere over there. Don't kill me with that. Oh, hey. Oh, man.
[323.04s -> 336.85s]  Give me this health. It is very important that I get that health. Stay alive. Hey, Spy. Hey, Spy. Hey, Spy.
[336.85s -> 353.69s]  How are you? Don't get hit by the blade. It's all about dodging these blades. Oh, my God. I thought that was...
[353.69s -> 366.28s]  I thought that was the saw blade. That just was like a scare moment right there. I feel like I just got hit by a car.
[366.28s -> 381.78s]  Let's go. Don't let them get it. Don't let them get it. We got this. We got this. Make our way out here.
[381.78s -> 390.48s]  Kill this Scout. Kill this Demo. Get hit from behind by God knows what. A soldier with the original.
[390.48s -> 412.71s]  Only one more minute. We got it. 33 seconds. Come on, folks. Come on, folks. Spray. No, I did my second jump already.
[412.71s -> 423.70s]  What? What are you doing up there, man? I'm going to kill this guy up here. Come on. Come here, you.
[423.70s -> 439.14s]  Are we going to win? I hope so. Yes, we are. Maybe not. Demoman, please don't kill me, sir.
[439.14s -> 447.84s]  All right, guys. Well, that's going to wrap up Face Game Fortress 2. Thank you so much for watching.
[447.84s -> 453.21s]  I really do appreciate it. And I'll see you guys all next time. And of course, take care, everybody.
