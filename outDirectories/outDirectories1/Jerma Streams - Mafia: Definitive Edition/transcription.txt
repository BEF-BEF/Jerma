[1.40s -> 5.90s]  Why did that just change back to Saw?
[5.90s -> 10.06s]  Oh, it's cause my streamlabs thing, it just took the stream from yesterday and said,
[10.06s -> 12.66s]  this is the stream that's today!
[12.66s -> 15.22s]  No, I got it, I got it, I updated it, I got it.
[15.22s -> 64.42s]  Alright, I'm not supposed to be here, I- hold on, beer B.
[64.42s -> 67.46s]  Okay, cool.
[67.46s -> 71.13s]  Does Saw again? It really shouldn't say Saw.
[71.13s -> 75.40s]  It should say... City.
[75.40s -> 78.54s]  Does it really matter?
[78.54s -> 82.57s]  Does it actually- I- okay, when you- think about a title.
[82.57s -> 85.37s]  Who am I trying to grab right now?
[85.37s -> 87.53s]  Am I trying to grab you?
[87.53s -> 89.93s]  Am I trying to have a cool title for you to come to the stream and be like,
[89.93s -> 94.38s]  whoa, that's a crazy title, I gotta cl- no, it's just a city, we're in a city.
[94.38s -> 96.22s]  You know what you're gonna get here.
[96.22s -> 99.42s]  I'm gonna crash the car five times in the first ten minutes.
[99.42s -> 102.97s]  I'm gonna run somebody over, I'm gonna punch somebody in the face and get out of the car.
[102.97s -> 104.97s]  And then the car's gonna explode.
[104.97s -> 107.21s]  And then I'm gonna have to restart the game four times.
[107.21s -> 110.09s]  Like, do I really need a title for that?
[110.09s -> 113.80s]  I mean, if I could do that for the title, I would do that.
[113.80s -> 115.00s]  No, you know what? No.
[115.00s -> 117.85s]  Fuck that. I ain't gonna do that today.
[117.85s -> 120.81s]  I'm gonna- in the first ten minutes, we're gonna do the first mission.
[120.81s -> 122.33s]  I'm not gonna do anything weird.
[122.33s -> 126.73s]  I'm sorry. All right, let's go.
[126.73s -> 131.30s]  I don't know why I did that. I'm sorry. I don't know why I did that.
[132.02s -> 133.54s]  That was so awful. That was evil.
[135.64s -> 137.16s]  Hey, is this a controller game, by the way?
[138.87s -> 139.67s]  He's amped up.
[144.22s -> 145.34s]  Evil Cloud.
[148.14s -> 149.42s]  I am actually a little amped up.
[151.70s -> 152.90s]  I'm looking forward to this.
[152.90s -> 159.51s]  Guys, we get excited on this channel for third-person punching driving games.
[161.21s -> 162.97s]  This is like my favorite thing in the world.
[167.46s -> 170.02s]  But I'd like to answer my question if I could get an answer to that question.
[172.20s -> 173.24s]  Is this a controller game?
[173.88s -> 174.84s]  Or keyboard and mouse?
[174.84s -> 176.60s]  I'm assuming it's probably controller, right?
[176.60s -> 177.32s]  Third-person?
[178.57s -> 180.01s]  Yeah, it's definitely a third-person game.
[180.01s -> 181.13s]  So I'm gonna use the controller.
[183.78s -> 185.38s]  Yeah. Yeah, yeah, definitely controller.
[186.76s -> 189.46s]  Great. Are you guys ready for Mafia?
[192.98s -> 194.34s]  How's that sound? Does that sound too low?
[199.69s -> 200.73s]  Nice and rainy out today.
[201.37s -> 204.34s]  You know, actually, I kind of missed this.
[205.77s -> 210.30s]  It hasn't rained in Vegas in probably, I don't know, wait.
[211.10s -> 212.38s]  Can my computer not run this game?
[213.02s -> 213.98s]  I think I just got a warning.
[214.62s -> 220.90s]  I think OBS just gave me a warning saying that the encoding was too high.
[220.90s -> 221.78s]  Can I not run this?
[222.95s -> 225.42s]  Uh-oh. Find out.
[228.94s -> 231.10s]  How much CPU is too much CPU to use for a game?
[233.29s -> 234.41s]  I gotta turn something down here.
[234.41s -> 235.21s]  All right, options.
[235.21s -> 236.33s]  All right, yeah, we gotta turn this down.
[236.97s -> 239.03s]  Stream is experiencing issues.
[240.20s -> 243.19s]  Fuck. Okay, hold on.
[244.15s -> 245.51s]  Hold on, I think I can fix this.
[250.34s -> 251.78s]  How bad does it look right now?
[251.78s -> 252.50s]  Is it all right now?
[253.22s -> 256.23s]  All right, display.
[257.03s -> 257.99s]  Yep, the field is off.
[259.67s -> 261.59s]  Which one of these is taking up a ton of CPU power?
[262.23s -> 265.18s]  It's a budget PC.
[265.90s -> 268.23s]  Yeah, guys, I have a 1080 in here.
[268.23s -> 270.23s]  I haven't upgraded my computer in six years.
[271.37s -> 272.33s]  Is that bad?
[272.33s -> 273.45s]  That 1080 is still fine.
[274.71s -> 275.75s]  Shadow quality low.
[276.47s -> 280.14s]  Yeah, that's probably that's what was hogging all the CPU.
[280.78s -> 284.22s]  It's not a pre-built, please.
[284.22s -> 285.58s]  At least give me a little bit of credit.
[286.30s -> 287.98s]  Somebody else built it for me.
[287.98s -> 291.59s]  What else should I turn off?
[292.15s -> 298.42s]  Everything else should be fine.
[298.98s -> 300.82s]  What about volumetric effects?
[302.84s -> 303.64s]  I think it should be fine.
[304.20s -> 305.85s]  All right, let's go.
[305.85s -> 306.33s]  Back it up.
[310.28s -> 311.48s]  Carcyclopedia.
[312.60s -> 313.32s]  Motion blur?
[313.32s -> 314.20s]  I turned it off, didn't I?
[314.92s -> 316.31s]  Yeah, motion blur is off.
[317.03s -> 318.55s]  Who the hell wants motion blur in their game?
[319.19s -> 319.83s]  All right, you ready?
[320.47s -> 322.60s]  I'm not going to go back and do Ratatouille again.
[322.60s -> 323.80s]  I ate the disk.
[323.80s -> 325.80s]  I ground it up and do a fucking spaghetti grinder,
[325.80s -> 327.32s]  and I put it into pasta.
[327.32s -> 329.22s]  Put vegetation on high.
[329.22s -> 331.46s]  Let's just see if this Walmart PC can handle it.
[331.46s -> 332.34s]  Story mode, here we go.
[332.34s -> 333.78s]  Medium, classic, hard mode.
[336.01s -> 336.25s]  No.
[336.73s -> 338.79s]  Players who want a fair fight.
[338.79s -> 340.07s]  There is low aim assistance.
[340.07s -> 341.67s]  Police respond to fewer crimes.
[342.31s -> 343.27s]  Enemies are more dangerous.
[343.27s -> 344.55s]  Police will respond to more crimes.
[344.55s -> 345.75s]  Fewer UI indicators.
[345.75s -> 346.47s]  Classic.
[347.19s -> 348.84s]  Enemies are lethal.
[349.40s -> 350.60s]  Police respond to more crimes.
[350.60s -> 351.48s]  Fewer UI.
[351.48s -> 354.68s]  And ammunition left in the clip is lost when reloading.
[354.68s -> 355.24s]  No thanks.
[356.04s -> 360.22s]  No thanks.
[360.86s -> 363.94s]  Play classic.
[363.94s -> 365.22s]  No, I'm not doing classic.
[365.22s -> 366.34s]  I'm terrible.
[366.34s -> 368.10s]  I'm not going to get past the first boss.
[368.98s -> 374.66s]  Can I change it in the game?
[374.66s -> 375.62s]  Can I change it mid-game?
[376.18s -> 378.26s]  Enemies are lethal.
[381.93s -> 382.65s]  This is...
[382.65s -> 384.33s]  Am I playing stalker?
[384.33s -> 385.37s]  Why is this even in here?
[390.41s -> 392.01s]  No manual transmission.
[392.01s -> 393.05s]  Tutorials, that's fine.
[393.05s -> 393.93s]  You can show them.
[393.93s -> 394.65s]  Here we go.
[397.70s -> 398.74s]  No, no, don't, no.
[401.05s -> 403.61s]  Game is piss easy on anything below classic.
[403.61s -> 404.97s]  Yeah, but I don't want to...
[404.97s -> 407.05s]  I don't care about how hard the game is.
[407.05s -> 408.65s]  I just want to drive around.
[408.65s -> 409.77s]  Hey, this is not a...
[409.77s -> 413.13s]  Look, maybe five, 10 years ago I would have cared about that.
[413.69s -> 416.71s]  Now I just want to hear the rain hit the side of my window
[416.71s -> 417.83s]  and the thunder.
[417.83s -> 419.94s]  Guys, I want to be able to just...
[419.94s -> 420.26s]  You know what?
[420.26s -> 422.50s]  I'm just going to turn this on at night later tonight
[422.50s -> 423.30s]  and just sleep to this.
[423.86s -> 425.83s]  This shit, I don't have to pay any more extra money.
[425.83s -> 427.35s]  I already paid $40 for that.
[427.35s -> 435.10s]  Here comes 2K presents.
[435.10s -> 437.42s]  Fucking 2K.
[437.42s -> 438.62s]  WWE Battlegrounds.
[438.62s -> 439.26s]  Get the fuck out of here.
[439.26s -> 439.98s]  The game's stupid.
[440.54s -> 441.90s]  I'm already angry.
[441.90s -> 443.02s]  All right, I'm going to be quiet.
[443.02s -> 471.26s]  I'm just waiting for one of these birds
[471.26s -> 474.62s]  to just crash into the camera that is our view
[474.62s -> 476.30s]  and it's Borderlands 4.
[476.30s -> 478.30s]  And then no rest for the wicked starts playing again.
[478.94s -> 497.37s]  This looks pretty good.
[497.37s -> 499.98s]  This looks good.
[499.98s -> 501.26s]  This looks really good.
[501.90s -> 504.09s]  Come on, my computer sucks.
[504.09s -> 504.73s]  I can't handle it.
[504.73s -> 506.25s]  But it's still like it's a little choppy for me.
[506.25s -> 507.37s]  But it should be all right.
[520.26s -> 521.06s]  Pre-rendered.
[521.06s -> 524.71s]  Oh, now you got my hopes up.
[524.71s -> 530.50s]  I'm just an annoying fucking drone.
[534.06s -> 535.98s]  That's the neighborhood kid with his fucking drone.
[536.70s -> 538.17s]  Watch out.
[538.17s -> 544.01s]  It goes by somebody's head.
[545.21s -> 545.69s]  Turns around.
[545.69s -> 547.77s]  The guy's got a huge bald spot on the top of his head.
[550.82s -> 551.94s]  You little bastard.
[552.58s -> 565.03s]  This is really fucking loud.
[565.03s -> 566.07s]  It's a cut scene loud.
[566.07s -> 566.47s]  Don't worry.
[566.47s -> 567.35s]  It'll be all right in a minute.
[568.15s -> 570.66s]  Oh, shit.
[570.66s -> 571.54s]  Lost another drone.
[572.60s -> 573.32s]  Lost another one.
[574.04s -> 591.16s]  You know what's the saddest part about this video
[591.16s -> 592.04s]  that we're watching right now
[592.04s -> 593.72s]  that was filmed on one of those drones?
[594.52s -> 596.30s]  It's unbelievable.
[596.30s -> 596.46s]  Wow.
[596.46s -> 597.50s]  What cinematography?
[597.50s -> 597.98s]  How beautiful.
[597.98s -> 598.78s]  You're gonna scroll down.
[599.66s -> 600.78s]  840 views.
[601.50s -> 615.02s]  Somebody said, you are so funny.
[615.02s -> 615.82s]  Ban that person.
[615.82s -> 617.26s]  I don't want to see them again.
[617.26s -> 618.62s]  Or at least a minute.
[618.62s -> 627.46s]  You think I was gonna catch you say that?
[628.18s -> 630.10s]  Hey, I only pick up the negative comments.
[630.10s -> 630.82s]  I'm a streamer.
[631.46s -> 634.62s]  I don't see any positive comments.
[634.70s -> 636.22s]  I see four messages an hour.
[661.21s -> 661.45s]  All right.
[661.45s -> 662.33s]  I can't talk.
[662.33s -> 663.05s]  No more talking.
[663.85s -> 665.37s]  I had something to say there, but be quiet.
[678.46s -> 680.54s]  I'm not looking for any associates.
[681.50s -> 682.86s]  It's a fucking huge hands.
[683.74s -> 684.62s]  Because I'm on the net.
[685.90s -> 687.18s]  Can't even pay for the coffee.
[689.21s -> 690.81s]  But I got plenty to trade.
[690.81s -> 692.62s]  Well, that's yours.
[694.33s -> 695.85s]  How long you've been in town?
[695.85s -> 696.65s]  Three years.
[697.69s -> 699.45s]  Caught my teeth in Empire Bay.
[700.09s -> 701.69s]  Well, they handed you the Morello case.
[702.65s -> 703.53s]  Right out of the gate.
[704.65s -> 707.48s]  Just want him to keep lighting cigarettes.
[707.48s -> 709.88s]  Just have like 12 cigarettes lit on the table.
[710.52s -> 711.88s]  They just keep picking up different ones
[711.88s -> 712.92s]  and smoking them.
[712.92s -> 714.76s]  Case must be getting pretty cold by now.
[715.40s -> 717.98s]  Or you got something might warm it up.
[718.94s -> 720.62s]  Yeah, I might have some.
[721.42s -> 723.02s]  I don't know what's my end of the deal.
[723.02s -> 724.54s]  Uh, you want money?
[724.54s -> 726.22s]  Some sort of immunity.
[726.22s -> 728.22s]  They didn't even care whose was whose.
[728.22s -> 729.58s]  I got people I need to protect.
[729.58s -> 732.54s]  Please.
[732.54s -> 734.06s]  Always the Achilles heel.
[734.06s -> 734.30s]  All right.
[734.30s -> 737.90s]  I'm gonna write a sick mom or a wife and a better kid.
[737.90s -> 738.70s]  Wife and daughter.
[740.04s -> 741.24s]  No one else to watch your back.
[741.24s -> 742.92s]  I'm guessing you wouldn't be here otherwise.
[743.64s -> 744.20s]  Pity that.
[744.20s -> 748.60s]  I always said a man needs friends if he's going to survive in this world.
[749.72s -> 750.04s]  Yeah.
[751.08s -> 755.16s]  Well, in my world, it's the other way around.
[757.99s -> 759.83s]  I have no idea what's happening.
[759.83s -> 762.71s]  All I know is cigarettes in town for a few days.
[762.71s -> 763.51s]  Cigarettes.
[763.51s -> 765.75s]  Not until I hear what you're trading.
[765.75s -> 771.72s]  So are you talking or are you just killing time before they come for you?
[773.11s -> 774.47s]  You think I'm on the run?
[774.47s -> 775.75s]  Oh, I know it, Tommy.
[776.31s -> 777.43s]  Jesus, look at you.
[778.31s -> 779.19s]  Surely gassed.
[779.19s -> 780.31s]  You haven't slept for days.
[781.43s -> 784.87s]  Your neck's gotta be aching from all that looking over your shoulder you're doing.
[785.67s -> 790.23s]  No, the way I figure it is you got someone powerful mean on your tail and they ain't
[790.23s -> 792.39s]  The annoying friend at the movie theater.
[793.93s -> 795.93s]  You walk out that door without maybe both.
[795.93s -> 797.69s]  No, you're not making it five steps.
[801.11s -> 804.01s]  Boss, yeah, you stick around.
[804.01s -> 808.81s]  You tell me your story and maybe you got a shot at living long enough to walk that
[808.81s -> 810.09s]  girl yours down the aisle.
[811.37s -> 814.94s]  Either way, it looks like I'm buying you a cup of coffee.
[815.66s -> 822.71s]  Chris, I don't know how everything got so balled up.
[822.71s -> 824.12s]  I know exactly what you're talking about, too.
[824.12s -> 826.36s]  No one ever sees the hairpin until it's too late.
[827.16s -> 829.64s]  Your friend is talking during the previews and you're like,
[829.64s -> 831.48s]  I hope he shuts the fuck up when the movie starts.
[831.48s -> 834.52s]  And the movie starts, the first one minute goes by, he's still talking to you.
[834.52s -> 836.36s]  It's like, god damn it, man.
[836.36s -> 837.80s]  We're both here for the same reason.
[837.80s -> 838.52s]  Please don't.
[839.08s -> 842.30s]  That's me right now.
[842.30s -> 846.25s]  What a hypocrite.
[846.25s -> 847.53s]  This isn't even a fucking movie.
[848.33s -> 848.65s]  All right.
[848.65s -> 849.61s]  I got a rebuttal to that.
[849.61s -> 852.25s]  I'm the 12th streamer you've seen play this game.
[852.25s -> 853.37s]  I'm like five days late.
[853.37s -> 858.14s]  It was at the end of one of those shifts when I first met Polly and Sam.
[861.02s -> 862.36s]  I was loud.
[864.70s -> 865.74s]  I don't watch anyone else.
[865.74s -> 866.46s]  Oh shit.
[866.46s -> 867.66s]  Well, I'll be quiet.
[868.54s -> 870.02s]  We've waited for you.
[872.02s -> 875.29s]  Oh, it's too loud.
[876.01s -> 880.33s]  Imagine being in a movie theater.
[881.53s -> 882.33s]  It's too loud.
[882.33s -> 883.21s]  It's too loud.
[883.21s -> 884.17s]  It's supposed to be loud.
[884.17s -> 885.29s]  You fucking asshole.
[885.29s -> 885.85s]  Shut up.
[885.85s -> 886.89s]  It's THX.
[903.32s -> 905.93s]  Oh, okay.
[906.65s -> 908.09s]  Let me break your immersion for a second.
[908.81s -> 909.05s]  Sorry.
[909.05s -> 911.13s]  This doesn't happen in movies, but it's happening here.
[914.39s -> 915.75s]  Is that what infinity war starts?
[917.05s -> 918.25s]  I know it's like the loop.
[930.79s -> 934.47s]  Who's so desperately the all right.
[934.47s -> 935.43s]  How do I how do I drive?
[937.75s -> 937.91s]  All right.
[937.91s -> 938.87s]  Where are we going?
[938.95s -> 940.39s]  Find ways to lose your tail.
[941.91s -> 942.95s]  I don't have any tutorials.
[948.42s -> 948.98s]  Oh, there we go.
[955.30s -> 956.74s]  I feel like I'm driving a toy car.
[957.70s -> 960.60s]  Is that us?
[965.32s -> 966.52s]  Hold LT to slow down.
[966.52s -> 967.08s]  Yeah, break.
[969.43s -> 970.47s]  Root to destination is shown.
[970.71s -> 973.67s]  Wait, we have GPS in like the 1930s.
[976.31s -> 977.27s]  That's kind of all right.
[977.27s -> 979.83s]  I'm glad that that would remake like hell.
[979.83s -> 981.51s]  We're back.
[981.51s -> 983.06s]  I'll wake up the doc.
[983.06s -> 983.62s]  I don't know.
[983.62s -> 984.42s]  It might be okay.
[985.06s -> 986.58s]  He's getting the call anyways.
[986.58s -> 987.70s]  The graphics are too good.
[988.66s -> 989.94s]  You don't get to listen either.
[989.94s -> 990.58s]  It's hard to drive.
[990.58s -> 992.26s]  The graphics are too good.
[992.26s -> 992.90s]  So do that.
[993.62s -> 1001.14s]  I'm turning the graphics on low.
[1001.14s -> 1002.58s]  I actually it's hard to do this.
[1002.58s -> 1004.34s]  Where am I taking you once we're over the bridge?
[1004.98s -> 1006.74s]  I'm getting tired out of questions.
[1007.30s -> 1008.58s]  Drive to central island.
[1009.38s -> 1011.45s]  Can I change the camera angle?
[1012.09s -> 1013.77s]  Turn limiter off.
[1013.77s -> 1014.25s]  What?
[1014.25s -> 1015.37s]  How do I change the camera angle?
[1015.37s -> 1016.33s]  I don't like this view.
[1016.33s -> 1017.29s]  I want to be a little closer.
[1025.94s -> 1026.44s]  What?
[1028.26s -> 1030.42s]  I know some shortcuts that'll slow them down.
[1030.42s -> 1031.78s]  I don't care how you do it.
[1031.78s -> 1032.26s]  What happened?
[1032.26s -> 1033.54s]  Shake them off.
[1033.54s -> 1034.58s]  Lose your tail.
[1034.58s -> 1035.62s]  Is encoding lag?
[1035.62s -> 1036.82s]  No, it's my computer.
[1036.82s -> 1038.58s]  Actually, we're going to have to turn the graphics down.
[1042.92s -> 1045.64s]  1080T omega lol.
[1045.64s -> 1047.00s]  8 omega lol.
[1047.00s -> 1049.67s]  These guys really don't like it, do they?
[1049.67s -> 1050.87s]  No, I said I wasn't going to hit anybody.
[1050.87s -> 1051.37s]  Good.
[1053.37s -> 1053.93s]  Master Shake?
[1054.97s -> 1057.69s]  All right.
[1057.69s -> 1059.05s]  Find ways to lose your tail.
[1059.05s -> 1059.45s]  Hold on.
[1059.45s -> 1060.09s]  It's still wait.
[1060.09s -> 1061.61s]  We're going to figure this out right now.
[1061.61s -> 1062.57s]  Hold on.
[1062.57s -> 1064.90s]  It's still fucking too loud.
[1065.46s -> 1067.94s]  And we got to put it on a little bit lower than this.
[1067.94s -> 1069.94s]  Geometry detail can put it on medium.
[1069.94s -> 1071.46s]  Decal is low.
[1071.46s -> 1072.26s]  Medium.
[1072.26s -> 1076.31s]  Look, you don't order a rare steak.
[1076.31s -> 1077.59s]  You don't order a well-done steak.
[1077.59s -> 1079.67s]  You order a fucking medium steak.
[1079.67s -> 1081.83s]  That's my reasoning for this.
[1086.84s -> 1087.40s]  Better?
[1087.40s -> 1088.04s]  I don't know.
[1089.64s -> 1095.02s]  What do you mean you don't order a medium steak?
[1095.02s -> 1095.82s]  That's what everybody does.
[1096.46s -> 1112.66s]  Okay, that was pretty funny.
[1112.66s -> 1113.62s]  I have to do that again?
[1113.62s -> 1115.06s]  What happens if I back through it?
[1119.08s -> 1119.96s]  It is Master Shake.
[1119.96s -> 1120.76s]  It's the same actor?
[1132.57s -> 1133.07s]  It is.
[1134.33s -> 1136.30s]  What's his name?
[1136.30s -> 1137.10s]  Dana Carvey?
[1137.10s -> 1138.06s]  No, not Dana Carvey.
[1138.06s -> 1138.54s]  What's his name?
[1139.26s -> 1140.30s]  All right, hold on.
[1140.30s -> 1141.10s]  I have to try something.
[1149.91s -> 1150.71s]  Come on, do it.
[1157.19s -> 1157.69s]  Yes.
[1163.62s -> 1167.10s]  Video games.
[1167.90s -> 1168.78s]  Aren't they great?
[1172.71s -> 1173.19s]  Oh shit.
[1173.83s -> 1176.82s]  Didn't kill anybody.
[1177.38s -> 1178.26s]  Don't shoot that lady.
[1178.26s -> 1178.74s]  What are you doing?
[1183.96s -> 1185.56s]  Custom character creator, is there?
[1190.65s -> 1191.77s]  All right, I don't want to do it yet
[1191.77s -> 1193.53s]  because we're right at the end of the mission.
[1193.53s -> 1195.93s]  But if I hit triangle, or why?
[1195.93s -> 1197.05s]  Will I just fall out of the car?
[1203.62s -> 1204.58s]  That's Carl.
[1204.58s -> 1206.34s]  That was Carl from Aqua Teen.
[1206.34s -> 1208.02s]  It's Aqua Teen Mafia Force.
[1218.62s -> 1219.12s]  Did it.
[1219.36s -> 1221.63s]  Now your night's not over.
[1222.27s -> 1225.12s]  I hope somebody just chimes in and just say,
[1225.12s -> 1227.20s]  yeah, let's get over there, man.
[1227.20s -> 1228.00s]  You think he squealed?
[1228.00s -> 1228.88s]  It's me, me.
[1228.88s -> 1229.12s]  Wrong.
[1229.12s -> 1230.64s]  I think you zip it tight.
[1230.64s -> 1232.16s]  We'll talk it through back at the bar.
[1233.85s -> 1235.77s]  That'd be so awesome if there's a guy that talks like that
[1235.77s -> 1237.45s]  that's in my friend group.
[1237.45s -> 1238.25s]  Hold on.
[1238.25s -> 1238.97s]  I don't like this.
[1240.17s -> 1240.89s]  Did I change this?
[1241.53s -> 1242.97s]  Hold on a second.
[1244.17s -> 1244.89s]  There we are.
[1244.89s -> 1246.17s]  Okay, vehicle camera pitch.
[1246.17s -> 1247.05s]  Does that make it better?
[1247.05s -> 1248.17s]  I didn't think that didn't do anything.
[1248.97s -> 1249.69s]  I made it worse.
[1258.16s -> 1258.96s]  1080 Ti.
[1259.52s -> 1262.01s]  Should I put this at 720p?
[1264.62s -> 1265.26s]  Shit, my light.
[1265.26s -> 1265.82s]  Wait.
[1265.82s -> 1267.50s]  I don't have a graphics card update.
[1267.50s -> 1269.50s]  I haven't updated my drivers in probably three years.
[1269.50s -> 1270.06s]  Should I do that?
[1273.24s -> 1280.78s]  Clock the frame rate to 30.
[1282.06s -> 1282.56s]  We'll see.
[1285.66s -> 1295.29s]  Is it CPU or GPU?
[1297.08s -> 1299.00s]  It seems, during cut scenes it's fine.
[1299.00s -> 1301.64s]  But just driving really fast is when my computer starts to hang a little.
[1302.28s -> 1315.02s]  Do a driver update.
[1315.02s -> 1316.86s]  But if I do a driver update, the screen turns off.
[1317.42s -> 1320.51s]  CPU is the problem.
[1320.51s -> 1321.39s]  Yeah, probably.
[1334.81s -> 1343.24s]  Don't do a Smash Brothers thing.
[1343.88s -> 1344.44s]  I did already.
[1363.24s -> 1366.68s]  I've refreshed the page and I got a Travis Scott burger advertisement.
[1367.71s -> 1368.21s]  Yes.
[1368.99s -> 1370.91s]  That's one of four ads on Twitch right now.
[1372.68s -> 1375.56s]  Hey, you want to go to McDonald's and get a hamburger with bacon on it?
[1376.73s -> 1377.23s]  We'll get it.
[1381.32s -> 1383.24s]  Anyone ask where you got that money?
[1383.24s -> 1384.36s]  You wanted a poker.
[1384.36s -> 1387.92s]  Scratches on your car?
[1390.14s -> 1390.78s]  You swerved.
[1391.42s -> 1393.79s]  To keep from hitting a little old lady.
[1393.79s -> 1394.99s]  You got it?
[1394.99s -> 1395.79s]  That actually did happen.
[1395.79s -> 1396.99s]  I just barely missed her.
[1398.75s -> 1399.87s]  Somebody bullet holes.
[1411.96s -> 1413.72s]  Wait, that's a different franchise.
[1413.72s -> 1416.03s]  When I opened the envelope...
[1416.03s -> 1416.67s]  That was pretty good.
[1416.67s -> 1417.71s]  ...I had a heart attack.
[1417.71s -> 1419.44s]  Fixed the cap.
[1420.75s -> 1423.60s]  Nearly enough to buy a new one.
[1423.60s -> 1425.60s]  Thought about what Sam said about work.
[1426.16s -> 1427.12s]  I wasn't interested.
[1427.84s -> 1429.34s]  The money was good, sure.
[1430.30s -> 1432.17s]  I didn't want to get in with criminals.
[1432.17s -> 1436.01s]  I just wanted to open the fridge and there's like a hundred packs of cigarettes in the fridge.
[1436.81s -> 1437.53s]  And the freezer.
[1437.53s -> 1439.13s]  So, right there.
[1439.13s -> 1447.26s]  Back then, I was out.
[1447.26s -> 1449.34s]  Hey, Chris Weed Piano, thanks for $50.
[1450.14s -> 1452.30s]  5,000 bits from Chris Weed Piano.
[1452.30s -> 1454.78s]  Jerma, could you tell me now when you're doing Weed Week?
[1454.78s -> 1456.96s]  There's no such thing.
[1456.96s -> 1458.52s]  That's a lot of money.
[1458.52s -> 1460.64s]  Thanks for the 50 bucks, dude.
[1460.64s -> 1462.80s]  That's a fucking extreme amount of money.
[1462.80s -> 1467.90s]  All right, 1930.
[1470.36s -> 1472.68s]  After that night with Salieri's guys,
[1472.68s -> 1474.52s]  I was back working as soon as I could.
[1475.56s -> 1476.44s]  But it felt different.
[1476.44s -> 1477.80s]  I think it's the lighting.
[1477.80s -> 1478.68s]  I gotta turn the lights down.
[1486.62s -> 1489.74s]  I need to get a fucking 3080.
[1495.95s -> 1496.75s]  All right, here we go.
[1496.75s -> 1497.71s]  First time on foot.
[1497.71s -> 1498.67s]  What's the punch button?
[1499.23s -> 1502.12s]  All right, wait a minute, wait.
[1502.76s -> 1503.90s]  Hold on, lady.
[1505.18s -> 1507.10s]  I'm currently trying to get my graphics to look okay.
[1507.66s -> 1512.20s]  I'm gonna turn on V-sync.
[1512.20s -> 1514.68s]  I'm gonna drop the FOV to like 85.
[1514.68s -> 1518.88s]  I'm gonna put the vegetation,
[1518.88s -> 1522.06s]  direct lighting below.
[1522.06s -> 1522.78s]  All right, there we go.
[1523.44s -> 1523.92s]  There we go.
[1526.89s -> 1528.01s]  That's pretty smooth.
[1528.99s -> 1530.57s]  That's pretty smooth.
[1530.57s -> 1531.29s]  I'm ready.
[1531.29s -> 1540.89s]  So where to?
[1540.89s -> 1542.49s]  St. Michael's Church.
[1542.49s -> 1544.33s]  All right, St. Michael's Church.
[1546.49s -> 1547.61s]  Careful, please.
[1548.17s -> 1549.53s]  I always drive careful.
[1549.53s -> 1550.73s]  Then you'd be the first.
[1551.96s -> 1553.40s]  Turn the speed limiter on.
[1554.27s -> 1555.63s]  Why would I want to put the speed limiter?
[1555.63s -> 1557.47s]  Motorcycle, motorcycle, motorcycle, motorcycle.
[1561.15s -> 1562.83s]  Oh, wait, I was doing a mission, right?
[1565.20s -> 1567.64s]  I can't do that with a lady in the car.
[1569.61s -> 1570.81s]  A cab driver is like,
[1570.81s -> 1573.71s]  oh, yeah, take me to 42nd Street, please.
[1573.71s -> 1574.59s]  Sure thing.
[1574.59s -> 1576.59s]  Motorcycle, motorcycle, motorcycle.
[1576.59s -> 1577.87s]  And they run the guy over.
[1578.88s -> 1579.92s]  What a fucking psycho.
[1579.92s -> 1581.32s]  So where to?
[1581.32s -> 1582.84s]  St. Michael's Church.
[1582.84s -> 1587.00s]  Directly.
[1587.00s -> 1588.12s]  Careful, please.
[1588.68s -> 1589.56s]  I always drive careful.
[1589.56s -> 1590.60s]  You have to obey the rules.
[1590.60s -> 1591.88s]  You'll be the first.
[1591.88s -> 1594.75s]  Turn on the speed limiter.
[1594.75s -> 1595.63s]  Oh, I see.
[1595.63s -> 1596.35s]  I don't want that on.
[1600.78s -> 1601.58s]  Get.
[1601.58s -> 1603.71s]  I don't honk the horn.
[1604.35s -> 1613.96s]  Church, it's Sunday already.
[1613.96s -> 1615.48s]  Eyes on the road, please.
[1619.12s -> 1619.62s]  No.
[1621.79s -> 1623.15s]  My milkshake brings all the...
[1623.79s -> 1625.39s]  It's in every fucking game, I think.
[1625.39s -> 1626.51s]  I can't get away from it.
[1634.14s -> 1635.18s]  I can't get away from it.
[1635.18s -> 1635.98s]  What do you want me to say?
[1636.54s -> 1639.98s]  A goose laugh?
[1655.64s -> 1658.48s]  Oh, drive carefully, respect the law.
[1663.48s -> 1663.96s]  I am.
[1663.96s -> 1664.84s]  I'm doing a good job.
[1670.11s -> 1671.07s]  Game's too good looking.
[1671.07s -> 1673.47s]  I like games that have like 2008 graphics,
[1673.47s -> 1674.59s]  not like 2020.
[1675.23s -> 1677.28s]  I should just play the original one.
[1684.04s -> 1686.20s]  I'm complaining about how it's good it looks
[1686.20s -> 1689.08s]  and how much it's bad it runs on my computer.
[1689.08s -> 1690.84s]  I could just play the original Mafia.
[1691.48s -> 1695.00s]  I ain't gonna do that, though.
[1695.00s -> 1695.96s]  Here you go.
[1695.96s -> 1696.68s]  St. Michael's.
[1697.40s -> 1698.44s]  That'll be 30 cents.
[1699.16s -> 1701.40s]  The only tip I'll give you is to stop smoking
[1701.40s -> 1702.12s]  in your vehicle.
[1702.68s -> 1704.60s]  I felt like I was sitting in an ashtray.
[1705.79s -> 1706.67s]  Sure.
[1706.67s -> 1707.63s]  Whatever you say.
[1709.23s -> 1710.99s]  I thought everybody smoked in like 1930.
[1718.96s -> 1720.00s]  All right.
[1720.00s -> 1723.88s]  There is no punch person button.
[1723.88s -> 1731.32s]  Fair.
[1731.32s -> 1732.04s]  Run her over.
[1732.04s -> 1732.28s]  I can't.
[1732.28s -> 1733.24s]  I'm not just gonna run her over.
[1733.80s -> 1734.88s]  All right.
[1734.88s -> 1736.48s]  Search the streets for fares.
[1736.48s -> 1736.96s]  Okay.
[1737.20s -> 1738.40s]  This is just crazy taxi.
[1739.12s -> 1752.67s]  Is there a person here?
[1752.67s -> 1753.31s]  You need a fare?
[1758.19s -> 1758.43s]  You?
[1762.52s -> 1763.56s]  Anybody need a ride?
[1766.03s -> 1767.07s]  I'm looking for Dave.
[1768.17s -> 1769.53s]  Lift for Dave.
[1769.53s -> 1772.64s]  Fucking God damn.
[1772.64s -> 1773.12s]  Hey.
[1773.12s -> 1774.16s]  Looking for Dave.
[1775.68s -> 1779.72s]  Your ride has canceled.
[1780.28s -> 1787.72s]  Oh, wait.
[1787.72s -> 1788.04s]  They can't...
[1789.08s -> 1790.52s]  I guess I did that on purpose.
[1806.46s -> 1807.18s]  Oh, here you are.
[1810.06s -> 1810.54s]  Come on in.
[1811.10s -> 1811.82s]  Where are you going, sir?
[1812.46s -> 1817.52s]  Where can I take you?
[1817.52s -> 1818.24s]  Art gallery.
[1818.24s -> 1819.04s]  Get me there quick.
[1819.04s -> 1819.68s]  Art gallery.
[1819.68s -> 1820.48s]  Get there quick.
[1820.48s -> 1821.44s]  Quick, I can do.
[1821.44s -> 1823.74s]  Is there...
[1823.74s -> 1825.18s]  Do they have handbrakes back in the 30s?
[1833.08s -> 1834.44s]  Didn't turn off the graphics.
[1834.44s -> 1834.92s]  Oh, right.
[1834.92s -> 1835.16s]  Hold on.
[1835.16s -> 1835.96s]  Let me try that.
[1835.96s -> 1851.92s]  It didn't change anything.
[1856.88s -> 1858.12s]  I think it's just a game.
[1860.92s -> 1861.88s]  Yeah, that didn't change anything.
[1868.12s -> 1869.40s]  Turn off the visuals.
[1869.40s -> 1870.92s]  I get to be busy.
[1870.92s -> 1873.56s]  Your busy day is going to be looking at old paintings.
[1873.56s -> 1874.92s]  I have a business meeting there with a copy.
[1874.92s -> 1876.04s]  It's the driver.
[1876.04s -> 1877.40s]  Actually, to be honest, it looks fine.
[1878.52s -> 1879.08s]  Yeah, it does.
[1879.08s -> 1879.96s]  Maybe you'll understand.
[1880.92s -> 1882.92s]  CPU can't handle the game and stream.
[1882.92s -> 1883.64s]  Yeah, yeah.
[1883.64s -> 1884.60s]  That can get you.
[1884.60s -> 1885.08s]  What the hell?
[1885.72s -> 1886.04s]  Let's see.
[1886.04s -> 1887.40s]  I got a six-core CPU.
[1887.40s -> 1890.20s]  The thing was expensive back in like 2014.
[1891.24s -> 1898.92s]  I got to hurry up.
[1899.56s -> 1905.05s]  I'm getting...
[1905.05s -> 1905.69s]  I'm just up...
[1905.69s -> 1908.17s]  I'm upgrading my CPU and GPU and motherboard.
[1908.17s -> 1909.37s]  I'm just going to get a new computer or whatever.
[1921.08s -> 1921.96s]  I'm going to get like a...
[1923.16s -> 1925.96s]  I'm going to get a 64-core computer.
[1925.96s -> 1929.66s]  That just spawned.
[1929.66s -> 1930.78s]  That taxi just spawned.
[1931.34s -> 1940.89s]  All right, get out.
[1940.89s -> 1942.22s]  Get the fuck out.
[1947.58s -> 1952.80s]  I'm going to do 1080p streams.
[1952.80s -> 1953.12s]  I don't know.
[1953.12s -> 1953.84s]  That's a good question.
[1964.60s -> 1967.32s]  GTA V runs good on this computer and this looks the same.
[1968.04s -> 1971.44s]  This is running fine, but you know, you get the idea.
[1973.12s -> 1974.16s]  I'm not going to do 1080p.
[1974.16s -> 1974.96s]  No, there's no reason to.
[1976.91s -> 1978.59s]  GTA V was in 2012.
[1979.39s -> 1979.87s]  Yeah, but...
[1982.80s -> 1983.28s]  Fuck.
[1983.28s -> 1983.76s]  That's right.
[1985.36s -> 1985.76s]  All right.
[1985.76s -> 1987.20s]  I'm getting a new computer tomorrow.
[1987.20s -> 1988.32s]  I'm getting a new computer tomorrow.
[2000.32s -> 2001.20s]  That's impossible.
[2004.78s -> 2005.26s]  Great deal.
[2007.68s -> 2008.24s]  Okay.
[2008.24s -> 2008.96s]  You can...
[2008.96s -> 2009.68s]  You can do that.
[2010.72s -> 2011.20s]  Wait.
[2011.20s -> 2012.32s]  Wait, run, run, run, run.
[2012.32s -> 2012.72s]  How do you run?
[2012.72s -> 2013.28s]  How do you sprint?
[2017.68s -> 2018.00s]  Shit.
[2021.24s -> 2021.72s]  I'm back.
[2021.72s -> 2022.04s]  I'm back.
[2022.04s -> 2022.36s]  I'm back.
[2022.36s -> 2022.60s]  I'm back.
[2022.60s -> 2023.00s]  I'm back.
[2023.00s -> 2023.80s]  So where were we?
[2026.06s -> 2027.26s]  Holy shit, dude.
[2041.50s -> 2042.83s]  He actually waited.
[2042.83s -> 2042.99s]  Yeah.
[2043.63s -> 2045.58s]  It's a handbrake button.
[2050.25s -> 2051.37s]  Stop and pay the fine?
[2054.01s -> 2054.89s]  What fine?
[2054.89s -> 2055.21s]  All right.
[2055.77s -> 2056.73s]  I'll pay the fine.
[2056.73s -> 2057.13s]  How much...
[2057.13s -> 2057.61s]  Wait.
[2057.61s -> 2058.25s]  Under arrest?
[2059.21s -> 2061.85s]  How much is fine?
[2062.41s -> 2067.93s]  It's like...
[2067.93s -> 2068.41s]  How much is it?
[2068.41s -> 2069.29s]  Ten cents?
[2069.29s -> 2070.09s]  How much is a fine?
[2070.73s -> 2077.52s]  That's a whole dollar.
[2078.16s -> 2081.64s]  Wait.
[2081.64s -> 2082.44s]  How much money do I have?
[2083.16s -> 2090.88s]  How do I get in the car?
[2092.54s -> 2092.78s]  Wait.
[2093.34s -> 2093.58s]  Oh.
[2097.18s -> 2097.42s]  All right.
[2097.42s -> 2097.90s]  You go first.
[2097.90s -> 2099.18s]  I don't want you to see me do anything illegal.
[2102.97s -> 2103.77s]  What's the speed limit?
[2103.77s -> 2104.09s]  30?
[2105.05s -> 2106.52s]  Oh, shit.
[2107.32s -> 2108.44s]  You have to do the speed limit.
[2113.08s -> 2118.22s]  That's kind of funny that you can do that.
[2118.30s -> 2120.30s]  You can put a speed limiter on your car.
[2127.76s -> 2128.08s]  You know what?
[2128.08s -> 2129.04s]  It's rendering the buildings.
[2129.04s -> 2130.24s]  You don't even render these buildings.
[2131.04s -> 2133.28s]  Just make them like bitmap cardboard cutouts
[2133.28s -> 2134.32s]  and the game will be fine.
[2134.96s -> 2137.23s]  I don't give a shit about the fire exits over there.
[2137.23s -> 2138.59s]  You can just remove them.
[2138.59s -> 2139.98s]  It's just unnecessary...
[2141.88s -> 2142.20s]  Oh.
[2143.68s -> 2144.80s]  I beeped at somebody.
[2145.44s -> 2145.76s]  What?
[2148.64s -> 2149.68s]  Beeping is illegal?
[2151.07s -> 2151.31s]  No.
[2151.31s -> 2151.79s]  Fuck that.
[2151.79s -> 2152.35s]  I'm out of here.
[2155.76s -> 2156.48s]  Oh, shit.
[2157.12s -> 2158.00s]  Boiled again.
[2158.72s -> 2165.29s]  I beeped at a pedestrian.
[2166.01s -> 2166.49s]  All right.
[2166.49s -> 2166.73s]  Hold on.
[2166.73s -> 2167.45s]  I got to...
[2167.45s -> 2170.19s]  Are you kidding me?
[2170.19s -> 2171.31s]  Right at the fucking end.
[2171.31s -> 2174.72s]  That's disturbing the peace.
[2174.72s -> 2177.76s]  So don't ever use your horn.
[2177.76s -> 2182.96s]  I've been working since 5.
[2182.96s -> 2183.76s]  So you're telling me...
[2183.76s -> 2184.40s]  It's your excuse.
[2186.72s -> 2187.28s]  Doing this...
[2187.28s -> 2191.23s]  Where are we going?
[2191.23s -> 2193.23s]  Is it going to get me arrested?
[2193.23s -> 2194.28s]  Okay.
[2194.28s -> 2197.08s]  If I don't tell the cops about the liquor on your breath,
[2197.08s -> 2198.44s]  you don't tell them when I break them.
[2198.44s -> 2199.64s]  I hear a siren already.
[2200.84s -> 2202.84s]  Don't loud noises in 1930.
[2202.84s -> 2205.47s]  Got any earth today?
[2207.90s -> 2209.10s]  Never enough of them.
[2209.10s -> 2211.95s]  Who's got the money for...
[2211.95s -> 2213.23s]  This isn't GTA.
[2214.03s -> 2214.59s]  That's true.
[2215.15s -> 2215.55s]  That's true.
[2227.04s -> 2227.20s]  Yeah.
[2227.20s -> 2228.40s]  I'm going to stream at 900p.
[2229.52s -> 2232.16s]  It's going to look crystal clear at 60fps.
[2233.20s -> 2234.64s]  I'm going to get a 3090.
[2234.64s -> 2236.96s]  I'm going to be a psycho and get a 3090.
[2236.96s -> 2240.16s]  And the 64 fucking core like 8 gigahertz processor.
[2240.16s -> 2241.28s]  I'm going to be able to...
[2241.28s -> 2243.84s]  NASA is going to be calling me to fucking CPU usage.
[2244.64s -> 2252.32s]  I'm going to be routing like air traffic control to this computer.
[2252.32s -> 2256.60s]  It's going to be so powerful.
[2257.16s -> 2261.24s]  Put the limiter on.
[2261.24s -> 2261.96s]  I don't want to get arrested.
[2265.02s -> 2266.70s]  It's illegal to drive in this lane, right?
[2266.70s -> 2267.18s]  Or is it?
[2267.18s -> 2272.19s]  Yeah.
[2272.19s -> 2273.79s]  Unkeyball in 4K.
[2274.43s -> 2280.60s]  All right.
[2280.60s -> 2281.24s]  We're almost there.
[2281.80s -> 2291.95s]  Let's get a sponsor so you get a free PC.
[2294.88s -> 2295.28s]  All right.
[2296.96s -> 2297.52s]  Excuse me.
[2297.52s -> 2299.12s]  Uh, can I have a free computer?
[2300.16s -> 2303.00s]  I have a streamer.
[2303.80s -> 2305.72s]  That means I got a free computer, right?
[2308.52s -> 2309.64s]  That's the email I sent.
[2311.93s -> 2313.93s]  Hey, uh, I just was hitting you up
[2313.93s -> 2317.53s]  because I'm a streamer and deserve a $5,000 PC for free.
[2318.17s -> 2319.21s]  Thank you for your time.
[2319.21s -> 2322.73s]  I, uh, respectfully yours, Jeremy Albertson.
[2322.73s -> 2333.88s]  I don't remember this person.
[2333.88s -> 2338.92s]  Do I get a bat though?
[2338.92s -> 2339.96s]  I'm so excited for the bat.
[2358.84s -> 2359.56s]  Let's get him.
[2365.36s -> 2370.65s]  Oh, why to vault?
[2373.93s -> 2374.33s]  Nice.
[2374.33s -> 2374.57s]  Okay.
[2374.57s -> 2375.61s]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[2378.17s -> 2379.13s]  I'm on classic mode.
[2379.13s -> 2379.85s]  This is not a joke.
[2380.41s -> 2388.65s]  We've got YouTube tutorial music in the background.
[2393.66s -> 2393.98s]  Run.
[2394.54s -> 2401.98s]  By the way, all videos with this song behind it
[2402.54s -> 2404.06s]  are less than three minutes long.
[2405.45s -> 2407.45s]  They're like two and a half, one and a half minutes long.
[2407.45s -> 2421.74s]  It's a quick DIY scripted.
[2421.74s -> 2422.70s]  You were supposed to do that.
[2429.50s -> 2430.54s]  That tripled Joe.
[2443.66s -> 2445.10s]  Trying to talk to that cabbie over there.
[2445.10s -> 2445.58s]  That's all.
[2447.13s -> 2448.17s]  That right.
[2448.17s -> 2448.49s]  Yeah.
[2449.13s -> 2449.61s]  What is he?
[2449.61s -> 2450.97s]  It's a Don's favorite driver.
[2451.53s -> 2454.57s]  So anything you got to say to him, you can say to me.
[2455.29s -> 2455.85s]  Is that right?
[2455.85s -> 2457.69s]  Well, I'll tell you something, pal.
[2457.69s -> 2458.81s]  We ain't leaving empty handed.
[2458.81s -> 2459.69s]  That's for sure.
[2459.69s -> 2462.09s]  Well, then maybe you ain't leaving at all.
[2466.96s -> 2468.88s]  Bad graphics.
[2468.88s -> 2469.60s]  Leave me alone.
[2475.77s -> 2477.29s]  The lighting is way too hard.
[2477.29s -> 2478.73s]  The face animations are bad.
[2480.62s -> 2481.90s]  Stop laughing at me.
[2481.90s -> 2483.10s]  At least we could do.
[2483.10s -> 2487.18s]  I'm going to update my graphics card.
[2487.18s -> 2488.38s]  I'll be back in like 10 minutes.
[2488.38s -> 2488.62s]  Yeah.
[2489.18s -> 2491.13s]  He's going to want to hear about this.
[2491.13s -> 2493.13s]  Why does it look like Toy Story 1?
[2494.19s -> 2496.97s]  Oh, it doesn't.
[2496.97s -> 2498.17s]  It looks like Toy Story 2.
[2501.20s -> 2502.72s]  Fucking God damn it.
[2503.52s -> 2504.48s]  Okay.
[2504.48s -> 2506.48s]  You buy my computer.
[2506.48s -> 2507.84s]  It's going to be a monster.
[2508.99s -> 2510.27s]  It's going to be insane.
[2510.27s -> 2511.23s]  I've waited long enough.
[2511.23s -> 2511.95s]  It's been six years.
[2511.95s -> 2513.55s]  It's been five years and five and a half years.
[2513.55s -> 2514.99s]  I've got to get a new computer or something.
[2514.99s -> 2516.43s]  I have to get like a new graphics card.
[2516.43s -> 2517.47s]  I can't just have it.
[2517.47s -> 2518.91s]  1080 is not going to take me forever.
[2520.76s -> 2521.88s]  As much as I wanted to.
[2522.52s -> 2530.81s]  I can't believe that a 1080 is worthy of Toy Story 1 graphics.
[2530.81s -> 2531.93s]  That's fucking crazy.
[2561.15s -> 2561.47s]  No, no, no.
[2561.47s -> 2561.63s]  Thanks.
[2561.63s -> 2561.95s]  No, thanks.
[2561.95s -> 2563.47s]  I don't want to learn from a mafia guy.
[2563.47s -> 2563.87s]  No, thank you.
[2563.87s -> 2565.31s]  I'm not looking for a handout.
[2565.31s -> 2568.11s]  This is when you just rip the fuck out of the seat
[2568.11s -> 2569.31s]  and run out as fast as you can and run.
[2569.31s -> 2571.79s]  I didn't want a shot at the bastards who wrecked my cabin.
[2571.79s -> 2576.97s]  You hear that, Frank?
[2576.97s -> 2579.69s]  The kid wants my permission.
[2579.69s -> 2580.41s]  Yes.
[2580.41s -> 2585.37s]  Okay, Tommy Angelo.
[2585.37s -> 2588.40s]  All the Morello's girls hang out at a bar he owns.
[2588.40s -> 2589.76s]  Paul, you know the place.
[2589.76s -> 2591.12s]  Boss?
[2591.12s -> 2591.84s]  It's not just you.
[2591.84s -> 2592.32s]  You're good.
[2592.32s -> 2593.52s]  You can ride along with Tommy.
[2593.52s -> 2594.88s]  This game is really stressful.
[2594.88s -> 2597.45s]  There's a lot right next to the bar where they park their cars.
[2597.45s -> 2598.09s]  Damn.
[2598.09s -> 2601.76s]  They'll smash up a few tin cans, send Morello a message.
[2602.32s -> 2604.64s]  He can't rough up hardworking joes in my neighborhood
[2604.64s -> 2606.65s]  without getting a black eye.
[2606.65s -> 2608.57s]  Thank you, Mr. Salieri.
[2608.57s -> 2609.45s]  I won't let you down.
[2610.17s -> 2616.54s]  People with better computers than you have frame rate problems.
[2616.54s -> 2616.78s]  Oh.
[2617.58s -> 2618.78s]  Oh, so the game sucks.
[2619.58s -> 2623.84s]  Okay, let's just check it.
[2623.84s -> 2628.43s]  I should turn the graphics back up.
[2628.43s -> 2629.71s]  It's not just a meat problem.
[2629.71s -> 2639.08s]  Okay, so there is just frame rate problems in the game.
[2639.08s -> 2640.04s]  Okay, I got you.
[2640.76s -> 2642.60s]  Well, let's go to at least Toy Story 2.
[2648.94s -> 2650.22s]  Okay, let's do medium.
[2650.22s -> 2651.34s]  I'll do medium.
[2651.34s -> 2652.51s]  But keep lighting.
[2652.51s -> 2653.63s]  Fuck lighting.
[2653.63s -> 2659.07s]  We're on max?
[2659.63s -> 2660.84s]  What are you trying to do to me?
[2663.77s -> 2664.33s]  Optimal?
[2664.89s -> 2671.32s]  Oh, that looks kind of good.
[2682.91s -> 2683.63s]  Look around the bar.
[2683.63s -> 2684.43s]  Can I talk to people?
[2688.76s -> 2693.55s]  Oh, what's this?
[2694.19s -> 2697.50s]  Prohibition here to stay.
[2697.50s -> 2699.34s]  I pay left.
[2699.90s -> 2703.85s]  Update your drivers.
[2704.57s -> 2706.17s]  But then I have to turn the stream off.
[2706.17s -> 2707.29s]  And I don't...
[2707.29s -> 2708.17s]  That's going to be a pain in the ass.
[2709.15s -> 2709.95s]  Oh, what's this?
[2715.56s -> 2717.00s]  We can wait.
[2717.72s -> 2720.12s]  Let me just check and see if I have...
[2720.12s -> 2720.52s]  Hold on.
[2721.08s -> 2722.30s]  Just do it when you have to pee.
[2722.30s -> 2722.94s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2722.94s -> 2723.50s]  That's what I'll do.
[2723.50s -> 2724.94s]  When I have to pee, I'm going to update my drivers.
[2727.34s -> 2728.86s]  I wonder if it'll turn the stream off.
[2728.86s -> 2729.82s]  It might not.
[2729.82s -> 2732.22s]  It takes like 10 minutes.
[2732.22s -> 2733.66s]  Yeah, well, on a break, I'll do it.
[2733.66s -> 2734.46s]  Not right now.
[2734.46s -> 2739.92s]  That's pretty cool, though.
[2739.92s -> 2743.47s]  What am I doing?
[2743.47s -> 2744.75s]  It said I was looking around the bar.
[2755.21s -> 2756.41s]  Going to be a restart anyways.
[2756.41s -> 2757.29s]  Shit.
[2758.60s -> 2758.92s]  All right.
[2765.13s -> 2768.41s]  How does the frame rate get better when I put the graphics on as high as they can go?
[2768.41s -> 2778.12s]  Does that make any sense?
[2778.12s -> 2778.60s]  Optimal.
[2786.75s -> 2790.00s]  Turn up the game audio?
[2790.00s -> 2790.32s]  I will.
[2794.17s -> 2794.73s]  Who are you?
[2795.29s -> 2796.09s]  What are you doing here?
[2811.93s -> 2812.17s]  Yes.
[2815.79s -> 2816.19s]  Finally.
[2819.87s -> 2820.99s]  Cocktails here.
[2825.29s -> 2825.69s]  No, thanks.
[2825.69s -> 2826.25s]  I don't drink.
[2826.25s -> 2827.29s]  Can you look back and forth?
[2829.53s -> 2840.43s]  And everybody does that exact same fake weird laugh.
[2840.43s -> 2840.67s]  All right.
[2840.67s -> 2841.95s]  I got molotovs.
[2842.67s -> 2843.71s]  Wait, there's a thing on the table.
[2847.88s -> 2848.68s]  Can I have your card?
[2849.40s -> 2851.20s]  This is pornography.
[2851.84s -> 2854.25s]  Was it?
[2854.25s -> 2854.57s]  I don't know.
[2854.57s -> 2855.05s]  I couldn't tell.
[2861.76s -> 2862.08s]  Guys.
[2864.48s -> 2865.92s]  Did I ever play the original Mafia?
[2868.43s -> 2869.79s]  Like a long time ago.
[2869.79s -> 2870.03s]  Yeah.
[2870.99s -> 2871.87s]  Not really, though.
[2872.43s -> 2875.50s]  I feel like I played it on this stream.
[2875.50s -> 2878.36s]  I played one of them on this stream, didn't I?
[2879.00s -> 2883.61s]  Mafia 2?
[2883.61s -> 2884.01s]  Mafia 3?
[2884.01s -> 2884.81s]  Oh, Mafia 3, yeah.
[2886.56s -> 2887.12s]  Hey, Gene.
[2890.99s -> 2894.49s]  Get your head out of here.
[2894.49s -> 2895.53s]  Fuck you, Papa Polly.
[2895.53s -> 2898.33s]  You can't just sneak up on a guy like that.
[2899.21s -> 2900.76s]  I'm sorry, Ralphie.
[2900.76s -> 2902.20s]  I'm just busting your balls.
[2905.44s -> 2906.88s]  See, you're still a limping.
[2906.88s -> 2909.44s]  Guess we got two cripples working here.
[2910.40s -> 2911.52s]  That kind of looks like me.
[2911.52s -> 2912.64s]  We ain't nothing alike.
[2913.79s -> 2914.75s]  You got that, Ralph?
[2915.63s -> 2916.67s]  Sure, Papa Polly.
[2916.67s -> 2916.91s]  Yeah.
[2917.87s -> 2918.27s]  Tommy.
[2919.74s -> 2920.46s]  Tommy Angelo.
[2921.10s -> 2921.90s]  Good to meet you.
[2922.54s -> 2925.58s]  Like I said, Ralphie here's a crack deck.
[2926.30s -> 2928.06s]  Well, you bring him a stolen car.
[2928.06s -> 2928.86s]  I'll make it yours.
[2928.86s -> 2930.06s]  It's only one voice actor?
[2930.06s -> 2930.46s]  Tell him to meet.
[2930.46s -> 2931.90s]  We got a job to do.
[2931.90s -> 2932.78s]  We need some wheels.
[2933.66s -> 2935.52s]  How about this one, Papa Polly?
[2935.52s -> 2937.68s]  That would be pretty funny, actually, if it was one person.
[2937.68s -> 2939.44s]  It'll get you across to the town.
[2939.44s -> 2940.24s]  All right.
[2940.24s -> 2940.72s]  Let's go.
[2941.36s -> 2942.00s]  You're driving.
[2944.83s -> 2947.63s]  And don't let me catch you loafing off again.
[2947.63s -> 2949.07s]  You caught that with one hand.
[2949.07s -> 2951.07s]  You do a two-handed clap catch.
[2951.71s -> 2952.99s]  That's not cool looking.
[2952.99s -> 2954.11s]  You don't look cool doing that.
[2954.11s -> 2957.16s]  One day I'm going to cut a line, asshole.
[2957.16s -> 2957.98s]  Holy shit.
[2957.98s -> 2960.62s]  I don't know what Ralph's trying to pull giving us this motor.
[2961.42s -> 2963.26s]  I want to show you something about the good life
[2963.26s -> 2965.98s]  and you're driving something my mom could have bought 20 years ago.
[2966.62s -> 2969.34s]  If I know Ralph, he probably got it taken out of our yard.
[2969.98s -> 2971.42s]  Hey, the car's fine.
[2971.42s -> 2973.02s]  It's good to get a change from the cab.
[2973.58s -> 2974.22s]  Oh, drive fast.
[2974.22s -> 2975.50s]  Don't be nice about it.
[2975.50s -> 2977.90s]  This thing's a tin can.
[2977.90s -> 2979.02s]  Megalol Disney game.
[2979.66s -> 2981.42s]  Is that whiskey back there in the truck?
[2981.42s -> 2982.30s]  We're on the frame limiter.
[2982.30s -> 2983.02s]  Yep.
[2983.02s -> 2984.14s]  New supplier.
[2984.14s -> 2986.62s]  You guys deal in broad daylight.
[2987.42s -> 2988.97s]  Normally not.
[2988.97s -> 2989.45s]  Is this...
[2990.01s -> 2991.37s]  There's no such thing as traffic lights.
[2991.37s -> 2993.05s]  Cops know better than to come sniffing around our turf.
[2993.05s -> 2994.57s]  How the fuck do people drive?
[2994.57s -> 2995.76s]  We're out.
[2995.76s -> 2997.28s]  The guy who's argy got it.
[2997.28s -> 2997.84s]  Oh shit.
[2997.84s -> 2998.72s]  I'm in the wrong lane.
[2998.72s -> 2999.84s]  We have more friends in the forest than us.
[2999.84s -> 3000.40s]  Arrest this guy.
[3000.40s -> 3001.28s]  He's beeping at me.
[3001.28s -> 3002.32s]  We're okay.
[3002.32s -> 3004.16s]  Be careful.
[3004.16s -> 3006.24s]  For our shoulder.
[3006.24s -> 3008.75s]  Is that the Canadian whiskey that comes through?
[3008.75s -> 3010.75s]  Guys, that's...
[3010.75s -> 3012.59s]  Dude, the game actually, like, improved.
[3013.87s -> 3015.07s]  I turned on the graphics.
[3015.07s -> 3016.11s]  I'm no big drinker.
[3016.67s -> 3018.19s]  I used a tip-back bathtub.
[3018.19s -> 3020.67s]  I didn't just stuffed up a bunch of crumpled pieces of paper
[3020.67s -> 3022.27s]  into my CPU bottleneck.
[3022.27s -> 3024.20s]  That stuff's no good for you.
[3024.20s -> 3027.21s]  You don't have to go boss.
[3027.21s -> 3028.73s]  You got a line in the good stuff.
[3029.74s -> 3030.70s]  That's good of you.
[3030.70s -> 3031.20s]  Thanks.
[3032.35s -> 3033.07s]  Not just the booze is fine.
[3033.07s -> 3033.95s]  Oh, the 1080's fine.
[3033.95s -> 3034.51s]  We're good.
[3034.51s -> 3036.75s]  It's the places we deliver to.
[3036.75s -> 3038.83s]  The deems they got in these places.
[3038.83s -> 3039.87s]  That's tables.
[3039.87s -> 3040.83s]  That's food.
[3040.83s -> 3041.79s]  That's a skirt.
[3042.43s -> 3043.23s]  Some way to live.
[3044.19s -> 3048.03s]  Right now, all I wanna do is wreck the day of the bastards who wrecked mine.
[3048.91s -> 3049.71s]  Sure.
[3049.71s -> 3050.59s]  Sure.
[3050.59s -> 3051.79s]  All right, take the limiter off.
[3051.79s -> 3052.27s]  No cops.
[3052.27s -> 3052.67s]  Let's go.
[3052.67s -> 3054.03s]  This could get a guy in trouble.
[3054.83s -> 3058.91s]  Trouble says the guy is about to set fire to Morello's parking lot.
[3061.00s -> 3061.50s]  What?
[3062.68s -> 3063.24s]  It'll go fine.
[3063.24s -> 3064.12s]  But you don't understand.
[3064.12s -> 3065.16s]  Well, if it don't go fine.
[3065.16s -> 3066.28s]  He's gonna do that at some point.
[3066.28s -> 3068.04s]  He's gonna do the hi, Master Shag voice.
[3068.04s -> 3068.92s]  And we're gonna all laugh.
[3068.92s -> 3071.00s]  You hit him so hard, they don't remember it.
[3080.40s -> 3082.43s]  I laughed.
[3082.43s -> 3083.39s]  Yeah, I did too.
[3083.39s -> 3083.95s]  We all did.
[3084.67s -> 3087.71s]  If you didn't, you must be immune to fun.
[3088.51s -> 3092.62s]  I'm gonna just lean back in the chair and went, ugh.
[3095.71s -> 3096.99s]  And they tried to click the X,
[3096.99s -> 3099.63s]  but they misclicked twice and opened up a new tab
[3099.63s -> 3101.15s]  and that pissed them off even more.
[3102.76s -> 3104.12s]  And they're not coming back to the screen.
[3105.93s -> 3106.65s]  They clicked wrong.
[3106.65s -> 3108.81s]  They like minimize the window or something in a fit of rage
[3108.81s -> 3110.33s]  and they're just like, fuck, I'm not coming back.
[3111.29s -> 3114.59s]  Hey, they'll be back.
[3114.59s -> 3115.55s]  Don't worry.
[3115.55s -> 3119.68s]  Oh, that was illegal.
[3119.68s -> 3120.72s]  No, no, no, right on red.
[3120.72s -> 3121.22s]  That's okay.
[3135.02s -> 3135.90s]  There was a guy there.
[3137.10s -> 3137.60s]  There's a crime.
[3139.34s -> 3141.50s]  In general, we look after little Italy
[3141.50s -> 3144.54s]  and his guys work North Park and more besides.
[3145.34s -> 3146.94s]  You're walking on the wrong sidewalk.
[3147.66s -> 3149.66s]  You can't turn right on red in New York City.
[3151.66s -> 3152.22s]  You can't?
[3152.22s -> 3153.98s]  Oh, well, all right.
[3153.98s -> 3156.46s]  They start appearing on street corners to stare you down.
[3159.05s -> 3160.41s]  This is not New York City.
[3160.41s -> 3160.91s]  Oh, okay.
[3163.64s -> 3164.60s]  This is Chicago.
[3165.85s -> 3166.41s]  Right.
[3166.41s -> 3167.77s]  Okay, not New York City.
[3168.41s -> 3170.89s]  Every game where a guy is in the mafia
[3170.89s -> 3172.89s]  does not take place in New York City.
[3172.89s -> 3176.09s]  As much as I apparently, I think that it is.
[3176.89s -> 3180.00s]  It's not Chicago either.
[3180.64s -> 3181.36s]  What is it then?
[3181.92s -> 3183.07s]  Where the hell are we?
[3189.02s -> 3190.06s]  This is not Boston.
[3190.78s -> 3193.98s]  I know what Boston looks like, guys.
[3193.98s -> 3194.70s]  It doesn't look like this.
[3195.58s -> 3197.28s]  And you might say, what do you do?
[3197.28s -> 3200.24s]  No, no, Boston's looked the same since 1930.
[3204.54s -> 3205.82s]  Nothing has changed.
[3205.82s -> 3209.37s]  It's a fictional city.
[3209.37s -> 3212.91s]  All right, follow up.
[3217.20s -> 3219.76s]  Okay, there was like a gravity hole over here.
[3219.92s -> 3220.88s]  That I just got pulled into.
[3222.40s -> 3224.08s]  All right, press right stick to sneak.
[3232.19s -> 3233.39s]  When do I get to use the bat?
[3242.03s -> 3243.23s]  Boston's a fake city.
[3244.62s -> 3245.12s]  Okay.
[3247.50s -> 3248.46s]  Open the gate, onto the roof.
[3248.46s -> 3248.96s]  You got it.
[3250.78s -> 3252.06s]  Holy shit, Polly.
[3252.06s -> 3253.26s]  That was fucking crazy.
[3253.82s -> 3258.06s]  Wish we got to get you in the Olympics.
[3258.62s -> 3269.18s]  Oh, I'm Tommy.
[3269.18s -> 3269.50s]  Right.
[3269.50s -> 3270.14s]  Okay, whatever.
[3270.78s -> 3271.68s]  All right, I'm up here.
[3272.40s -> 3282.12s]  Sneak up up.
[3282.12s -> 3285.02s]  How do I jump down?
[3285.82s -> 3288.65s]  Keep distracting him.
[3301.47s -> 3302.19s]  What does that matter?
[3302.75s -> 3307.45s]  Why does that even matter?
[3307.45s -> 3308.09s]  What do you mean?
[3308.09s -> 3308.65s]  Who cares?
[3309.69s -> 3310.57s]  Oh no, Polly.
[3311.13s -> 3312.17s]  I cut his legs off.
[3316.08s -> 3318.00s]  Take it back and start swinging.
[3319.00s -> 3320.44s]  Oh shit, there's a weapon wheel.
[3320.44s -> 3321.96s]  Oh my god, there's a hitman feature.
[3321.96s -> 3323.00s]  This game is cool.
[3323.00s -> 3323.64s]  Hold on.
[3323.64s -> 3324.36s]  What do I do with them?
[3324.92s -> 3333.47s]  Okay, use the bat.
[3333.47s -> 3335.00s]  It's a weapon wheel?
[3335.90s -> 3337.10s]  Oh shit.
[3337.10s -> 3338.22s]  It just got fucking real.
[3340.22s -> 3341.74s]  Oh my god, the game just got real.
[3341.74s -> 3343.90s]  This became, might be one of my favorite games of the year.
[3344.62s -> 3345.66s]  Just because I just watched.
[3345.66s -> 3346.78s]  That animation's all I care about.
[3351.56s -> 3353.16s]  This is a crow hop swing.
[3361.24s -> 3362.52s]  Oh, this is going to be great.
[3363.32s -> 3368.09s]  Okay, let's go.
[3368.73s -> 3370.40s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[3371.84s -> 3379.05s]  Is there a Batman in the head?
[3381.15s -> 3381.55s]  In the head?
[3384.99s -> 3386.19s]  Molotov?
[3386.19s -> 3387.15s]  Oh shit.
[3387.15s -> 3388.19s]  It's right bumper and then you...
[3388.99s -> 3390.27s]  Oh man, this game's fun.
[3390.91s -> 3391.71s]  This game's fun.
[3392.51s -> 3398.64s]  Holy shit.
[3399.28s -> 3408.32s]  Okay, you cannot do that to a friend of yours
[3408.32s -> 3409.84s]  and have your friend trust you ever again.
[3410.48s -> 3411.76s]  Oh man, I was just messing around.
[3413.68s -> 3414.40s]  No, you weren't.
[3414.40s -> 3416.16s]  Man, I don't think we can hang out anymore.
[3423.23s -> 3424.67s]  It was intent behind that swing.
[3431.34s -> 3431.84s]  Go.
[3436.01s -> 3440.86s]  Watch out, lady.
[3446.65s -> 3448.41s]  He is in the ignition here.
[3450.64s -> 3452.32s]  Oh wow, this game's really cool.
[3453.52s -> 3454.24s]  Oh, sick jump.
[3456.80s -> 3457.30s]  Yeah.
[3460.30s -> 3461.02s]  Are they going to do it?
[3461.02s -> 3461.52s]  No.
[3462.38s -> 3466.81s]  What's a bicycle for?
[3466.81s -> 3467.29s]  Oh no, no, no, no.
[3467.29s -> 3469.47s]  That's handcuffs on the right.
[3473.02s -> 3474.78s]  Stay out of sight till they lose interest.
[3475.58s -> 3477.18s]  What's the handbrake, dude?
[3477.18s -> 3478.30s]  I don't know what the handbrake is.
[3479.10s -> 3482.70s]  Fuck, what's the handbrake?
[3482.70s -> 3483.26s]  Does anybody know?
[3483.90s -> 3484.46s]  Is it B?
[3485.82s -> 3487.29s]  It's B, okay.
[3488.01s -> 3496.16s]  Didn't expect me to hit the brakes.
[3496.88s -> 3499.32s]  It's not Y.
[3499.32s -> 3500.44s]  Y falls out of car.
[3508.44s -> 3509.95s]  They're right behind us, dude.
[3513.98s -> 3514.48s]  Hey!
[3516.86s -> 3517.58s]  What are you...
[3517.58s -> 3522.14s]  I feel like I'm playing Mario Kart
[3522.14s -> 3525.02s]  and someone's trying to make me stay in second place.
[3525.02s -> 3525.90s]  Get away from me.
[3530.01s -> 3530.81s]  Bingo.
[3530.81s -> 3532.97s]  It's pretty clean.
[3532.97s -> 3533.77s]  Did he do it clean?
[3533.77s -> 3534.27s]  Nope.
[3534.73s -> 3537.96s]  Press X real quick.
[3537.96s -> 3538.92s]  No, I know what that does.
[3541.56s -> 3542.28s]  Clear.
[3542.28s -> 3546.97s]  Okay, stay out of sight till they lose interest.
[3547.85s -> 3548.49s]  All right, are we good?
[3549.29s -> 3551.40s]  There's a car behind us.
[3553.34s -> 3554.62s]  What a joke of a streamer.
[3554.62s -> 3558.17s]  Hey, is that a cop right there?
[3559.13s -> 3560.33s]  What's the blue thing right there?
[3560.33s -> 3560.89s]  Is that a cop?
[3562.43s -> 3563.23s]  Blip on the minimap.
[3563.23s -> 3563.63s]  Blue blip.
[3563.63s -> 3564.13s]  What is that?
[3567.42s -> 3568.46s]  Yes, yeah, okay, okay, okay.
[3568.46s -> 3569.50s]  We lost them.
[3569.50s -> 3571.64s]  Stay out of sight till they lose interest.
[3572.44s -> 3576.88s]  All right, we're almost out.
[3579.28s -> 3580.40s]  I want to run this guy over so bad.
[3585.37s -> 3586.01s]  Okay, I'm good.
[3594.17s -> 3596.17s]  Blue blip is a Dunkin' Donuts location.
[3598.49s -> 3599.21s]  You know what's funny?
[3600.09s -> 3603.21s]  I know for a fact that what you're saying is a joke,
[3603.21s -> 3606.97s]  but there definitely is a Find the Dunkin' Nearest You app.
[3609.29s -> 3610.81s]  Why would you ever want that app?
[3610.81s -> 3611.45s]  What's it for?
[3611.45s -> 3612.49s]  Why would you even need to know that?
[3613.53s -> 3616.25s]  Drive one mile in any direction in New England.
[3617.93s -> 3619.29s]  Why do you need an app to tell you where to go?
[3622.09s -> 3622.89s]  That's like being like,
[3623.85s -> 3627.61s]  can I find a McDonald's anywhere at some point in the next 20 minutes?
[3628.17s -> 3629.29s]  Yes, you can.
[3629.29s -> 3633.37s]  Just drive straight on any road in the world.
[3633.37s -> 3634.09s]  You will find one.
[3639.13s -> 3640.33s]  If you ever feel like going to McDonald's,
[3640.33s -> 3641.37s]  don't even put in your GPS.
[3641.37s -> 3641.93s]  There's no reason to.
[3642.81s -> 3643.37s]  Take a road.
[3644.81s -> 3645.29s]  You'll find it.
[3652.41s -> 3653.21s]  Is he brainless?
[3656.33s -> 3656.89s]  Brain limiter.
[3657.53s -> 3658.57s]  And he's an old bastard.
[3658.57s -> 3660.73s]  I care, but we don't need the attention.
[3661.77s -> 3666.64s]  And one day I found myself in the yard behind a bar drawing with Vincenzo.
[3667.28s -> 3669.84s]  10 years go by and I'm still there.
[3669.84s -> 3671.28s]  That says a lot about society.
[3671.28s -> 3673.44s]  I got a suit now and Vinny's an old bastard.
[3674.80s -> 3677.12s]  I always thought that to be in a family you had to have more
[3678.16s -> 3678.96s]  connections.
[3678.96s -> 3680.08s]  Fuckin' society.
[3680.08s -> 3681.76s]  Or your uncle.
[3681.76s -> 3683.12s]  Oh, some guys.
[3683.12s -> 3684.08s]  Sure.
[3684.08s -> 3686.40s]  Your cousin got made or you like Carlos.
[3686.40s -> 3688.00s]  Pop went way back with the Don.
[3688.64s -> 3691.04s]  That means you get trusted more when you're starting out.
[3691.60s -> 3694.72s]  There's plenty of us who keep me in on the street.
[3694.72s -> 3696.80s]  I'm thinking we get here in front of the boss.
[3697.52s -> 3698.56s]  Then we tip a few.
[3699.52s -> 3701.12s]  Well, I don't got plans.
[3701.12s -> 3702.88s]  So what's the green eye?
[3703.92s -> 3705.20s]  There's a green eye right here.
[3705.20s -> 3707.28s]  Vinny so much booze that Luigi.
[3707.28s -> 3708.00s]  What's that for?
[3708.00s -> 3708.80s]  Green eye.
[3709.76s -> 3710.80s]  I'm good with whatever.
[3711.60s -> 3712.88s]  Sure you are.
[3713.44s -> 3717.37s]  Can you do like peel outs in 1930?
[3720.12s -> 3722.28s]  No, the engine ran on like fucking humidity.
[3724.73s -> 3725.61s]  You can't.
[3725.61s -> 3731.87s]  We get it.
[3731.87s -> 3734.17s]  What happened to the Christ sent you out with?
[3736.80s -> 3743.76s]  Why?
[3743.76s -> 3744.40s]  Yes.
[3744.40s -> 3746.32s]  Ray never killed nobody.
[3746.32s -> 3747.52s]  Why is the tire fire?
[3749.08s -> 3750.36s]  Wait, one of the tires is on fire?
[3754.27s -> 3755.31s]  Baseball bat him.
[3756.43s -> 3756.99s]  You can't.
[3756.99s -> 3758.99s]  You can't baseball bat your friends.
[3758.99s -> 3761.63s]  That's not going to work in this game.
[3761.63s -> 3771.39s]  Hey, fellas.
[3771.39s -> 3772.35s]  You get to play pool?
[3772.35s -> 3773.79s]  Because I'll never play it because I hate pool.
[3773.79s -> 3774.35s]  I think it sucks.
[3774.35s -> 3775.07s]  It's a dumb sport.
[3777.88s -> 3779.88s]  I was really vicious for no reason.
[3782.76s -> 3783.56s]  I'm just kidding.
[3783.56s -> 3784.44s]  I like pool.
[3784.44s -> 3785.32s]  I play it.
[3785.32s -> 3787.48s]  I play it like I played it like two weeks ago.
[3789.21s -> 3790.09s]  Come on, guys.
[3790.81s -> 3793.13s]  He's not going to be able to think straight for weeks.
[3795.12s -> 3798.36s]  See, that's the difference between me and Meroa.
[3799.16s -> 3800.44s]  I'm a businessman.
[3800.44s -> 3801.56s]  I do everything with this.
[3802.20s -> 3803.66s]  I just want to start eating cigarette.
[3803.66s -> 3804.14s]  I make?
[3804.70s -> 3806.76s]  It's what's good for the business.
[3806.76s -> 3811.05s]  Boys, a Merela is a hothead.
[3811.05s -> 3814.75s]  And all that anger burns out the brain.
[3814.75s -> 3818.09s]  And when he gets mad, he gets stupid.
[3818.09s -> 3820.81s]  You got nothing like that to worry about with Tommy here.
[3820.81s -> 3822.41s]  He was aces the whole way, boss.
[3823.13s -> 3824.09s]  I'm glad to hear it.
[3824.73s -> 3826.59s]  I got a growing business here.
[3827.64s -> 3829.80s]  We could use a guy like you to help out around the bar.
[3829.80s -> 3830.44s]  I'm scared of you.
[3830.44s -> 3832.04s]  Maybe run some errands.
[3832.04s -> 3833.96s]  Make sure the bills get paid on time.
[3833.96s -> 3834.52s]  You up for that?
[3835.64s -> 3837.08s]  It'd be an honor, sir.
[3842.24s -> 3843.12s]  What do you think the room would do?
[3844.88s -> 3846.80s]  But you need to understand we have a few rules around here,
[3846.80s -> 3848.00s]  so you listen and listen good.
[3848.88s -> 3851.44s]  First, no cursing on the premises.
[3851.44s -> 3853.36s]  There's a million words out there.
[3853.36s -> 3856.32s]  The man who needs to resort to fuck this and fuck that
[3856.32s -> 3857.92s]  is just ignorant or lazy.
[3858.80s -> 3861.12s]  Second, we don't deal in the hard stuff.
[3861.12s -> 3863.44s]  I don't want any dolphins in this neighborhood.
[3863.44s -> 3865.20s]  We'll let Merela poison his own people.
[3865.20s -> 3866.88s]  What would happen if I said, yeah, that's great.
[3866.88s -> 3869.60s]  Can you lean forward a little bit and say that into my chest?
[3870.48s -> 3872.52s]  A little bit clearer and loud this time.
[3872.52s -> 3875.23s]  You cross the line.
[3875.23s -> 3876.67s]  The rest will come after you.
[3876.67s -> 3877.31s]  You understand?
[3877.87s -> 3879.61s]  Yes, Mr. Celieri.
[3879.61s -> 3886.00s]  Then I'm going to only ask you for one more thing, Tommy.
[3886.00s -> 3887.20s]  I didn't even have a wire on.
[3888.40s -> 3890.64s]  It's a bad prank to pull on the Don.
[3890.64s -> 3893.34s]  A lot of guys out there are bigger and tougher than these two.
[3893.34s -> 3896.86s]  And I don't keep Frank on a payroll because he's smart.
[3896.86s -> 3899.32s]  Though he is an artist with the numbers.
[3901.20s -> 3906.91s]  All these guys in this room, they're here because they have
[3906.91s -> 3908.75s]  the only thing that matters to me.
[3909.71s -> 3912.35s]  The only thing that should matter to any of us.
[3913.07s -> 3913.87s]  Your dog.
[3913.87s -> 3915.15s]  You know what that is, Tommy?
[3915.15s -> 3915.63s]  My dog.
[3917.29s -> 3917.77s]  Your dog.
[3918.41s -> 3919.29s]  His dog.
[3919.29s -> 3920.49s]  Somebody's dog in this room.
[3922.86s -> 3923.36s]  Money.
[3923.98s -> 3926.49s]  That's right.
[3926.49s -> 3928.86s]  Now, you stay straight with me.
[3928.86s -> 3930.64s]  You're going to be living the high life, Tom.
[3930.64s -> 3933.52s]  You abuse my trust.
[3935.20s -> 3938.40s]  Don Celieri, you won't ever need to worry about me.
[3941.29s -> 3943.05s]  Until halfway through the game.
[3944.22s -> 3947.26s]  When you double cross me and then I get angry and we fight
[3947.26s -> 3949.26s]  and I end up shooting you third person mode.
[3951.92s -> 3953.04s]  Or a grenade.
[3953.04s -> 3955.44s]  Eating one of those is going to work probably in the next two or three hours.
[3955.44s -> 3956.48s]  Now I'm starving.
[3956.48s -> 3960.00s]  Luigi, let's eat.
[3960.00s -> 3967.71s]  Is that guy going to ask me for the Everlasting Gobstopper recipe?
[3967.71s -> 3971.24s]  Not much for Cook, but his daughter, Sarah.
[3971.24s -> 3977.87s]  What was that guy's name in Willy Wonka?
[3977.87s -> 3978.83s]  Squidward or something?
[3978.83s -> 3979.71s]  It was something like that.
[3980.35s -> 3981.71s]  Oh, that's my associate.
[3981.71s -> 3982.43s]  Squidward.
[3982.43s -> 3982.83s]  What is it?
[3982.83s -> 3983.63s]  What was his name?
[3983.63s -> 3986.72s]  It's something like Slugworth.
[3986.72s -> 3987.76s]  Yeah, that's Slugworth.
[3987.76s -> 3991.93s]  The guy eats and delivers messages.
[3992.01s -> 3995.45s]  The guy's busted balls and told stories from the old country.
[3996.25s -> 3997.77s]  Mostly we just waited.
[3997.77s -> 3999.13s]  I got to thinking.
[3999.13s -> 4002.01s]  Maybe life in Celieri's crew wasn't going to get me clipped.
[4004.33s -> 4005.13s]  What did I know?
[4005.13s -> 4005.85s]  Fight practice?
[4006.57s -> 4008.09s]  Ooh, that was a good move.
[4008.09s -> 4008.59s]  Yeah.
[4010.76s -> 4011.26s]  Thanks.
[4013.96s -> 4016.84s]  Wait, is it the...
[4016.84s -> 4017.64s]  Can I play too?
[4019.13s -> 4020.09s]  All right, guys, that's enough.
[4020.09s -> 4020.59s]  Settle down.
[4022.91s -> 4023.87s]  Wow, they actually listened.
[4026.59s -> 4028.11s]  Holy shit, the whole place cleared out.
[4028.67s -> 4031.02s]  I have power here.
[4032.24s -> 4032.96s]  Holy shit.
[4032.96s -> 4033.46s]  All right.
[4038.33s -> 4039.05s]  Anybody in here?
[4039.05s -> 4042.99s]  All right, I gotta go back into the room.
[4042.99s -> 4045.16s]  There he is.
[4045.16s -> 4046.28s]  Sorry I'm late.
[4046.28s -> 4047.32s]  Take a seat.
[4047.32s -> 4048.04s]  It's a fun game.
[4049.74s -> 4050.54s]  I like that game.
[4053.52s -> 4054.32s]  Aren't we just in here?
[4054.32s -> 4055.92s]  That's collection day, boys.
[4055.92s -> 4057.72s]  Tommy, you'll drive?
[4057.72s -> 4059.16s]  Bully and Sam can handle the rest.
[4059.16s -> 4061.05s]  It'll be routine.
[4061.05s -> 4063.05s]  Just a handful of stops today.
[4063.05s -> 4065.37s]  Bill at the motel was a little short last month.
[4065.37s -> 4067.66s]  We'll make sure he pays us the interest he owes.
[4067.66s -> 4068.94s]  No problem, boss.
[4068.94s -> 4071.42s]  Don't lay hands on anyone unless there's no other choice.
[4072.38s -> 4075.74s]  Our clients need to understand that we provide a valuable service.
[4076.46s -> 4079.42s]  They need to look at you and see Santa Michael.
[4079.42s -> 4081.45s]  They need to believe you'll protect them.
[4082.25s -> 4083.37s]  So let Morello stoop to bring them in.
[4083.37s -> 4084.09s]  Need to believe?
[4084.65s -> 4085.53s]  We're better than that.
[4085.53s -> 4087.16s]  The bills still do?
[4087.16s -> 4088.12s]  Wait, this is illegal?
[4088.12s -> 4089.08s]  Everyone pays up.
[4089.08s -> 4092.12s]  We can handle it.
[4092.12s -> 4092.62s]  Um.
[4092.62s -> 4093.56s]  Go see Ralphie about a car.
[4094.12s -> 4094.92s]  Okay, boss.
[4094.92s -> 4095.42s]  Yeah.
[4095.96s -> 4096.60s]  Yes, very.
[4097.24s -> 4101.93s]  For a second I thought he was smoking the cigar backwards.
[4102.97s -> 4104.76s]  Like, holy shit.
[4104.76s -> 4106.20s]  What a Chad move.
[4106.20s -> 4110.68s]  Probably just wants to tell you some bullshit story about some guy he whacked 20 years ago.
[4117.60s -> 4118.56s]  I kind of like this outfit.
[4118.56s -> 4119.52s]  I feel like I would wear this.
[4119.52s -> 4120.32s]  Nah, lose the tie.
[4120.88s -> 4122.24s]  Lose the tie, lose the hat.
[4122.24s -> 4123.44s]  Zip it down a little bit more.
[4123.44s -> 4124.32s]  Like another four inches.
[4137.15s -> 4137.65s]  All right.
[4138.59s -> 4139.09s]  Hey.
[4141.40s -> 4142.12s]  What'd you see?
[4142.12s -> 4142.62s]  Something new?
[4146.83s -> 4147.63s]  Wait, what do you mean?
[4147.63s -> 4149.55s]  You see like this little shitty gun you thought of me?
[4150.11s -> 4152.67s]  You didn't see like a rifle or a bazooka and think of me?
[4152.67s -> 4153.47s]  What's that supposed to mean?
[4153.47s -> 4154.11s]  You think that's funny?
[4155.56s -> 4156.36s]  What am I funny to you?
[4156.36s -> 4157.08s]  You think that's a joke?
[4157.96s -> 4158.68s]  Fucking little gun?
[4167.28s -> 4168.08s]  Funny like a clown?
[4168.08s -> 4168.58s]  Funny?
[4169.04s -> 4169.54s]  Funny how?
[4170.64s -> 4173.80s]  What an incredible scene.
[4176.32s -> 4177.68s]  Oh shit, I just tried to shoot him.
[4177.68s -> 4178.56s]  Do you think he would hear that?
[4182.01s -> 4188.38s]  There's no bullets in here, dude.
[4191.23s -> 4191.73s]  Oh, okay.
[4193.39s -> 4194.19s]  He can see it.
[4195.07s -> 4196.19s]  He can see it.
[4196.83s -> 4199.02s]  How do you reload?
[4199.02s -> 4199.52s]  Oh.
[4201.23s -> 4202.19s]  All right, X is reload.
[4210.88s -> 4211.38s]  Oh.
[4215.44s -> 4216.72s]  And don't shoot yourself.
[4216.72s -> 4217.52s]  Thanks, Vincenzo.
[4217.52s -> 4218.48s]  Don't shoot yourself.
[4218.48s -> 4218.98s]  I got it.
[4227.63s -> 4228.13s]  Thanks.
[4228.43s -> 4229.07s]  All right, Ralph.
[4229.07s -> 4229.63s]  I'm ready.
[4229.63s -> 4230.35s]  I get my gun.
[4231.15s -> 4232.11s]  I know how to reload.
[4232.75s -> 4236.20s]  You guys are in the way.
[4236.20s -> 4236.70s]  No, you're not.
[4237.16s -> 4239.18s]  Do a diaper check.
[4242.81s -> 4243.53s]  All right, Ralph.
[4244.67s -> 4245.63s]  Do we all have guns?
[4249.84s -> 4251.12s]  One year since the crash.
[4252.27s -> 4252.75s]  The worst?
[4252.75s -> 4254.11s]  Yeah, Wall Street crash.
[4254.11s -> 4254.61s]  Right.
[4258.17s -> 4258.67s]  Beyond Meat.
[4265.04s -> 4265.54s]  Easy.
[4278.11s -> 4279.39s]  That was really easy.
[4279.39s -> 4280.99s]  You're a regular magician, Ralphie.
[4282.19s -> 4282.99s]  Oh shit, that's right.
[4282.99s -> 4285.31s]  These are when the doors were made out of, like, clay.
[4285.87s -> 4286.93s]  I forgot.
[4288.35s -> 4292.11s]  Opening a car door was as simple as just pulling it a little harder than normal.
[4292.11s -> 4304.73s]  These things don't even turn on, man.
[4305.45s -> 4308.01s]  This is a lemon.
[4315.82s -> 4317.42s]  Al's late again?
[4317.42s -> 4318.14s]  Seems so.
[4319.02s -> 4319.82s]  That's too bad.
[4321.29s -> 4322.65s]  What happened to him?
[4323.29s -> 4324.73s]  What happened to him?
[4324.73s -> 4325.29s]  Is he okay?
[4327.87s -> 4329.76s]  Drive safe, Tom.
[4330.65s -> 4331.85s]  Holly's real belly.
[4334.70s -> 4335.58s]  He's alive still.
[4336.30s -> 4339.29s]  Stop it.
[4339.29s -> 4339.93s]  He's all right.
[4339.93s -> 4340.49s]  He's fine.
[4343.58s -> 4344.46s]  Drive to the collection.
[4345.80s -> 4347.32s]  Oh, now that's what we're talking about.
[4347.32s -> 4352.28s]  I can't snap my fingers and drive the car.
[4356.12s -> 4359.00s]  By the way, can I tell you what my favorite game, Billiards?
[4360.04s -> 4361.00s]  It's one of the best.
[4361.64s -> 4364.92s]  I like to go just, like, to the bar and play a round or two with the friends.
[4365.56s -> 4377.68s]  Is he drunk?
[4379.08s -> 4379.88s]  At what?
[4379.88s -> 4384.12s]  Are you asking me if I'm drunk at 1 15 in the afternoon on a Tuesday?
[4386.38s -> 4386.88s]  Yes.
[4387.26s -> 4400.24s]  Turn up the volume.
[4400.96s -> 4403.88s]  Set a reasonable volume.
[4403.88s -> 4407.23s]  All right, we have to collect money, so don't hurt them, right?
[4407.23s -> 4411.92s]  Just drive up here and be like, give me the money.
[4412.64s -> 4416.24s]  And aim the gun at him, but don't shoot.
[4417.64s -> 4418.28s]  Got it.
[4418.28s -> 4419.09s]  Easy.
[4425.31s -> 4426.03s]  Hey, Tom.
[4426.03s -> 4428.20s]  When it goes smooth, it's a breeze.
[4428.20s -> 4431.88s]  When they put up a fight, sometimes you gotta think on your feet.
[4431.88s -> 4432.28s]  Sure.
[4432.28s -> 4433.72s]  Just follow my lead.
[4433.72s -> 4438.57s]  Oh, did you guys hear Otto sneeze?
[4439.45s -> 4442.17s]  He just went...
[4445.80s -> 4447.68s]  Okay, done.
[4452.35s -> 4453.07s]  We're good.
[4453.07s -> 4454.03s]  How's little Julia?
[4454.03s -> 4454.67s]  How's the money?
[4455.23s -> 4456.35s]  I mean, how's the restaurant?
[4458.03s -> 4462.99s]  This letter is a notification that you are in default of your obligation
[4462.99s -> 4465.34s]  to make payments on your agreed loan.
[4465.34s -> 4468.62s]  This amount has been overdue since July 15, 1930.
[4468.62s -> 4470.30s]  You've ignored requests to pay this debt,
[4470.30s -> 4472.38s]  unless the full amount is received, within two weeks,
[4472.38s -> 4473.82s]  I will have no choice but to instruct this bank
[4473.82s -> 4476.30s]  to begin the foreclosure process of your home and business.
[4476.30s -> 4477.26s]  That's us.
[4486.00s -> 4487.60s]  So we have to do, like, protection?
[4487.60s -> 4488.96s]  We have to rough the place up?
[4488.96s -> 4490.00s]  Should I just eat a bunch of bread?
[4496.96s -> 4498.56s]  Stop picking up loaves and taking bites?
[4503.32s -> 4505.64s]  All right, let's give him one another month.
[4509.95s -> 4511.23s]  I think he deserves another month.
[4516.08s -> 4516.64s]  Double or nothing.
[4517.44s -> 4519.04s]  If he doesn't have the money in three months,
[4521.69s -> 4523.77s]  then we come back and we, I don't know,
[4523.77s -> 4534.08s]  we, like, take his sneakers and we sell them.
[4534.08s -> 4534.96s]  There's drugs back here.
[4534.96s -> 4536.08s]  I don't feel bad anymore.
[4536.08s -> 4541.37s]  Dude, he's got a Sam Trappini card?
[4541.37s -> 4541.85s]  This is gonna...
[4541.85s -> 4543.53s]  This is, like, worth, like, five grand.
[4543.53s -> 4547.85s]  What's he saying?
[4550.32s -> 4551.68s]  Able brown envelope.
[4551.68s -> 4561.15s]  That's not...
[4561.15s -> 4561.87s]  Oh, I would...
[4561.87s -> 4565.23s]  I probably wouldn't be doing that if I were you.
[4565.23s -> 4570.17s]  Lady, you're lucky that this is a fucking World of Warcraft sanctuary.
[4570.17s -> 4576.60s]  Otherwise, a chair is flying across the room.
[4576.60s -> 4577.08s]  I got it.
[4577.08s -> 4581.79s]  You need anything, anything at all.
[4581.79s -> 4583.13s]  Show the wheels, Sam.
[4583.13s -> 4584.17s]  Daily WoW reference.
[4584.17s -> 4584.81s]  Yeah, that's the one.
[4591.29s -> 4597.71s]  That old lady has more power than the Dawn.
[4597.71s -> 4598.75s]  Somebody's gonna fight back.
[4599.72s -> 4601.16s]  And then I'm gonna have to take out the bat
[4601.80s -> 4603.00s]  and start swinging, right?
[4603.72s -> 4604.60s]  That's how this is gonna work.
[4616.04s -> 4616.44s]  No, don't...
[4616.44s -> 4617.16s]  What's the point of that?
[4617.80s -> 4618.84s]  That doesn't do anything for me.
[4619.56s -> 4621.63s]  That was just gonna be violence.
[4622.27s -> 4623.15s]  Just for violence.
[4623.15s -> 4624.27s]  Like, no, I'm not doing that.
[4624.27s -> 4624.99s]  We're just gonna drive.
[4628.14s -> 4629.58s]  Well, that's what we called him.
[4629.58s -> 4632.30s]  Probably slammed his head into the counter back in...
[4633.18s -> 4634.30s]  27, I think.
[4636.06s -> 4637.82s]  Yeah, it was hilarious.
[4637.82s -> 4640.22s]  After that, no problems at all.
[4640.22s -> 4641.98s]  If you look, you can still see the blood.
[4642.54s -> 4644.62s]  Poor old bastard couldn't scrub it out.
[4645.74s -> 4645.90s]  Is it...
[4645.90s -> 4646.46s]  Can I go?
[4647.42s -> 4649.26s]  I don't know the rules of the road.
[4649.26s -> 4651.34s]  I don't know the right-of-way tears.
[4652.78s -> 4653.18s]  Slow down.
[4653.18s -> 4654.06s]  I'm going over the speed limit.
[4654.06s -> 4655.66s]  But we don't know Eugene's nephew,
[4655.66s -> 4657.42s]  so he might need reminded, too.
[4663.69s -> 4664.57s]  People just go.
[4665.37s -> 4667.68s]  It's not even four-way stop signs.
[4667.68s -> 4669.92s]  It's just drive across four lanes.
[4670.72s -> 4671.44s]  This is bad.
[4679.60s -> 4681.28s]  Welcome to the 1920s, yeah.
[4681.84s -> 4688.41s]  I'm not going over the speed limit, right?
[4691.56s -> 4692.28s]  Don't break any laws.
[4692.28s -> 4693.00s]  There's a cop right here.
[4693.56s -> 4694.59s]  That guy's a cop.
[4697.74s -> 4698.56s]  No.
[4698.56s -> 4699.52s]  That car is a cop.
[4700.16s -> 4701.63s]  Something over there is a cop.
[4708.41s -> 4708.81s]  Go ahead.
[4708.81s -> 4709.61s]  Go, go, go, go ahead.
[4709.61s -> 4709.77s]  Go.
[4709.77s -> 4710.17s]  Get ahead.
[4710.81s -> 4714.00s]  Get ahead.
[4714.00s -> 4714.48s]  Move.
[4714.48s -> 4716.92s]  Oh, there's a guy in the way.
[4717.56s -> 4720.20s]  If there's a pedestrian in a crosswalk
[4720.20s -> 4721.40s]  and you're waiting for the pedestrian
[4721.40s -> 4722.12s]  you get beeped at,
[4722.84s -> 4724.28s]  that person deserves a middle finger.
[4724.84s -> 4738.30s]  I was backing out of a spot.
[4739.18s -> 4741.50s]  Okay, so this is the story
[4741.50s -> 4742.86s]  that I think about sometimes.
[4743.50s -> 4744.54s]  I was backing out of a spot
[4746.06s -> 4747.26s]  in a parking lot one time,
[4747.98s -> 4749.34s]  and there was this lady
[4749.34s -> 4751.26s]  who was parked perpendicularly
[4751.26s -> 4752.14s]  right behind me.
[4752.14s -> 4752.94s]  She was stopped.
[4752.94s -> 4753.42s]  She wasn't parked,
[4753.42s -> 4755.18s]  but she was pulled up in the parking lot.
[4755.18s -> 4756.54s]  I think she was waiting for somebody or something,
[4756.54s -> 4758.14s]  but she was right in the way
[4758.14s -> 4759.18s]  of where I was trying to back up.
[4759.18s -> 4760.54s]  She was right just blocking me,
[4761.50s -> 4762.38s]  and she didn't move.
[4763.42s -> 4764.54s]  This lady did not move.
[4764.54s -> 4766.14s]  It was like I had to finagle
[4766.14s -> 4767.66s]  so much around her car,
[4768.38s -> 4769.98s]  and she kept on closing her door,
[4769.98s -> 4770.30s]  and she's like,
[4770.30s -> 4771.10s]  no, back up, back up.
[4771.10s -> 4771.58s]  Yeah, you're good.
[4771.58s -> 4772.06s]  You're good.
[4772.06s -> 4773.18s]  And she's like, okay, what the fuck?
[4773.18s -> 4774.22s]  I did my good.
[4774.22s -> 4774.94s]  I'm out.
[4774.94s -> 4775.74s]  And right at the very end,
[4775.74s -> 4776.38s]  I didn't say anything.
[4776.38s -> 4777.18s]  He's doing the story.
[4777.18s -> 4777.98s]  Right at the very end,
[4777.98s -> 4778.54s]  when I finally,
[4778.54s -> 4780.30s]  after a full minute of doing
[4780.30s -> 4781.18s]  an eight-point turn
[4781.18s -> 4782.14s]  to get around this lady,
[4782.70s -> 4784.22s]  I put my thumb out the window
[4784.22s -> 4786.22s]  and gave up a thumbs up real quick,
[4786.22s -> 4786.86s]  and I think she thought
[4786.86s -> 4788.14s]  I gave her the finger.
[4788.14s -> 4789.95s]  I was like, yep, yep, I'm good,
[4789.95s -> 4791.07s]  but I think she saw the finger
[4791.07s -> 4791.63s]  and was just like,
[4791.63s -> 4792.11s]  fuck you.
[4798.94s -> 4799.74s]  But it was a thumbs up.
[4799.74s -> 4800.70s]  It was like, I'm good, yeah.
[4803.84s -> 4804.73s]  Did we get out of the car?
[4807.53s -> 4808.09s]  That was a sign.
[4808.09s -> 4809.05s]  That happened in Seinfeld.
[4810.49s -> 4814.28s]  Wait, that happened in Seinfeld?
[4817.85s -> 4818.97s]  I'm not lying.
[4818.97s -> 4820.65s]  I didn't watch an episode of Seinfeld
[4820.65s -> 4821.93s]  and then pulled it out of my memory.
[4822.49s -> 4824.89s]  I gave the thumbs up to somebody.
[4824.89s -> 4825.53s]  Here he comes.
[4826.17s -> 4827.53s]  That's not a fake story.
[4832.44s -> 4833.72s]  I swear to God that happened.
[4836.12s -> 4838.12s]  It happened in Seinfeld.
[4839.16s -> 4840.20s]  Dude, this dude just watched
[4840.20s -> 4841.32s]  an episode of Seinfeld
[4842.12s -> 4844.04s]  and then somehow made it
[4844.04s -> 4845.08s]  a part of his life.
[4846.12s -> 4848.68s]  No, this happened three weeks ago.
[4848.68s -> 4849.88s]  It was not that long ago.
[4856.19s -> 4857.39s]  Holy shit, that guy just
[4857.39s -> 4858.51s]  monster trucked that dude.
[4868.28s -> 4869.40s]  Kind of not hot.
[4869.40s -> 4869.88s]  I don't know.
[4871.40s -> 4872.20s]  Stealing jokes.
[4873.64s -> 4874.68s]  Is it stealing jokes
[4874.68s -> 4876.44s]  if it happened to you in real life?
[4876.44s -> 4878.60s]  We've been working these streets for years.
[4878.60s -> 4880.84s]  You come in and you think you know it all.
[4880.84s -> 4882.20s]  I'm not saying that, Sam.
[4882.20s -> 4884.36s]  I mean, you've been a day on the job, pal.
[4884.36s -> 4885.88s]  You haven't seen what we do.
[4885.88s -> 4887.24s]  You haven't seen how we do it.
[4887.24s -> 4888.20s]  I swear to God.
[4889.08s -> 4890.12s]  No, Polly.
[4890.12s -> 4891.64s]  This punk thinks he can walk in.
[4891.64s -> 4892.92s]  Why did I think that was a good idea?
[4892.92s -> 4894.44s]  Hey, Ralphie, I said.
[4894.44s -> 4896.12s]  Tom sure can drive.
[4896.12s -> 4897.80s]  No working after hours.
[4897.80s -> 4898.52s]  We OK?
[4898.52s -> 4899.48s]  After me and Sam.
[4901.08s -> 4902.52s]  No chance of that.
[4902.52s -> 4903.72s]  I thought it was grass.
[4903.72s -> 4904.60s]  I thought it was grass.
[4904.60s -> 4906.04s]  I just got like loony tune.
[4906.04s -> 4906.76s]  No, Polly.
[4906.76s -> 4908.52s]  This punk thinks he can walk in here.
[4908.52s -> 4909.40s]  You hid.
[4909.40s -> 4910.28s]  You knew I was going to try
[4910.28s -> 4911.48s]  to go through the cut through the grass.
[4912.04s -> 4913.80s]  And you put a bunch of rocks in them.
[4913.80s -> 4914.28s]  Sorry.
[4914.28s -> 4916.33s]  I'd say sorry.
[4916.33s -> 4918.09s]  If I couldn't see the bullshit smile
[4918.09s -> 4919.05s]  you're trying to hide.
[4919.85s -> 4927.52s]  I could smell the crap in your pants from here.
[4927.52s -> 4928.72s]  No, you didn't get me.
[4930.40s -> 4932.40s]  When little Pony first came out with us,
[4932.40s -> 4934.08s]  I had him on his knees before he knew.
[4934.08s -> 4935.28s]  This is beautiful.
[4935.28s -> 4936.40s]  This beautiful countryside.
[4936.40s -> 4937.20s]  Where are we supposed to be?
[4939.68s -> 4940.72s]  I want to visit this place.
[4945.29s -> 4946.09s]  New York.
[4946.09s -> 4946.81s]  New York City.
[4946.81s -> 4948.57s]  I hate it out of the city.
[4948.57s -> 4950.41s]  You hate it most places.
[4950.41s -> 4952.25s]  Yeah, but out here it's worse.
[4952.25s -> 4954.97s]  How come there's a place so far out of town on our books?
[4954.97s -> 4957.05s]  Out of town's the safest place for deals.
[4957.69s -> 4959.13s]  Safest place for card games.
[4959.69s -> 4962.17s]  The safest place for most of the things we do.
[4962.17s -> 4962.81s]  Card games.
[4962.81s -> 4964.73s]  We're expecting a big bag of money today.
[4965.45s -> 4966.09s]  The guy owes.
[4966.09s -> 4967.77s]  All right, I gotta ask you guys a really important question.
[4967.77s -> 4970.01s]  This is the definitive moment of the stream.
[4970.01s -> 4971.77s]  Yeah, this place is a real earner.
[4971.77s -> 4974.01s]  Is it mafia or mafia?
[4974.01s -> 4976.01s]  The places that give you the most dough are the ones most people all get twice.
[4976.01s -> 4977.61s]  A lot of people say mafia.
[4977.61s -> 4978.89s]  I'm going to be playing mafia.
[4978.89s -> 4980.33s]  I'm going to play mafia.
[4980.33s -> 4983.21s]  Last stop before I lost heaven for rum coming up from Cuba.
[4983.21s -> 4983.93s]  Oh, shit.
[4983.93s -> 4984.89s]  Is it good at this far?
[4984.89s -> 4985.61s]  Sure, they do.
[4986.25s -> 4988.73s]  And that's how we can sell it so expensive.
[4988.73s -> 4989.61s]  What am I talking about?
[4989.61s -> 4990.57s]  People say mafia.
[4990.57s -> 4990.89s]  Mafia.
[4990.89s -> 4992.41s]  The rates get exchanged.
[4992.41s -> 4993.53s]  Salieri protects it,
[4993.53s -> 4995.53s]  but he lets the other families use it too.
[4995.53s -> 4997.45s]  Even Barolo could keep the peace.
[4997.45s -> 4998.65s]  Not mafia.
[4998.65s -> 5000.97s]  Plus, it's far enough away that no one cares.
[5000.97s -> 5002.25s]  So long as everyone does that.
[5002.25s -> 5003.21s]  Yes, they do.
[5003.21s -> 5004.57s]  No one's going to rock the boat.
[5008.83s -> 5010.03s]  Yes, they do.
[5010.03s -> 5011.39s]  Be on the meter here, Tom.
[5012.75s -> 5014.43s]  I wouldn't be saying it if it wasn't true.
[5014.43s -> 5017.15s]  Anyone else starting to miss the side of the streets and sidewalks?
[5017.15s -> 5019.47s]  You're not one for the great outdoors, Polly.
[5019.47s -> 5021.15s]  He's not one for anything.
[5021.15s -> 5024.51s]  Indoors, out of the city.
[5024.59s -> 5025.09s]  Oh.
[5026.75s -> 5030.83s]  Like when we sit in the field doing some booze handover or something.
[5030.83s -> 5035.63s]  It's always knee-deep and shit and most times it's dark and cold as hell.
[5035.63s -> 5038.03s]  That's why it's good we got you now, Tom.
[5038.03s -> 5039.95s]  You can do all the jobs that Polly hates.
[5039.95s -> 5041.07s]  Make pronunciations.
[5042.83s -> 5045.39s]  I've heard people say mafia.
[5046.03s -> 5046.75s]  Mafia.
[5046.75s -> 5047.63s]  Mafia.
[5047.63s -> 5048.67s]  People say Mario.
[5049.55s -> 5050.43s]  Super Mario.
[5050.43s -> 5052.03s]  So it's not above what?
[5052.03s -> 5052.99s]  This is not even right.
[5052.99s -> 5054.51s]  He's just going to love you.
[5062.06s -> 5065.66s]  People say Super Mario and mostly they're over the age of 50.
[5066.46s -> 5070.54s]  Don't tell me that your parents did not call him Super Mario.
[5071.42s -> 5071.98s]  Yes, they did.
[5077.96s -> 5079.00s]  Those people are wrong.
[5079.00s -> 5080.20s]  That doesn't mean they don't happen.
[5090.38s -> 5091.42s]  Cool, man.
[5091.42s -> 5099.87s]  The name Mario existed before that game.
[5102.38s -> 5102.88s]  So?
[5105.66s -> 5109.42s]  I'm not arguing the origins of the name Mario.
[5109.42s -> 5111.66s]  I just said some people pronounce it Mario.
[5112.46s -> 5123.88s]  Herman, you're like five years younger than my dad, Omega Lo.
[5123.88s -> 5124.52s]  No, I'm not.
[5125.56s -> 5126.76s]  Dad's like 39?
[5127.48s -> 5128.12s]  How old are you?
[5129.00s -> 5135.42s]  Are you eight?
[5135.42s -> 5138.88s]  What are you doing here?
[5138.88s -> 5140.80s]  This is a legal stream for you to be on.
[5146.86s -> 5147.82s]  Look, it's...
[5149.88s -> 5150.44s]  Where's the rock?
[5151.08s -> 5153.04s]  There's no rock in there.
[5159.23s -> 5160.99s]  I was hoping for an explosion.
[5160.99s -> 5161.95s]  I'll be honest.
[5161.95s -> 5162.99s]  Okay, let me be...
[5162.99s -> 5163.87s]  I'll come clean here.
[5164.27s -> 5167.29s]  I was hoping it was a gas tank explosion.
[5167.29s -> 5168.09s]  I was going for it.
[5201.08s -> 5202.68s]  Wally, go do your thing.
[5215.45s -> 5220.56s]  Find a way into the motel, sure.
[5221.20s -> 5227.00s]  Got to be a secret wall here somewhere.
[5227.96s -> 5238.92s]  Okay, there would be no suspicion here.
[5238.92s -> 5240.52s]  You would think there was an animal outside.
[5241.08s -> 5241.96s]  Like a raccoon.
[5242.52s -> 5253.95s]  Let my friend go.
[5254.51s -> 5267.50s]  What's in here?
[5267.50s -> 5268.81s]  A bed.
[5268.81s -> 5273.18s]  Take care of all the thugs.
[5273.18s -> 5273.74s]  I will.
[5273.74s -> 5277.26s]  There's a thug over here.
[5277.26s -> 5286.19s]  Where is he?
[5286.19s -> 5288.84s]  Oh, shit, I thought he was sitting at the dinner table.
[5288.84s -> 5289.56s]  Is he underneath me?
[5290.12s -> 5298.03s]  Who the fuck is this guy?
[5298.03s -> 5308.44s]  The front door isn't going to open.
[5310.97s -> 5311.93s]  Okay, the floor...
[5311.93s -> 5312.65s]  Oh, fuck.
[5312.65s -> 5314.17s]  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[5314.17s -> 5316.01s]  The green indicator is not an enemy.
[5331.48s -> 5332.92s]  Oh, shit.
[5333.56s -> 5338.36s]  It's on classic mode.
[5338.36s -> 5339.16s]  He's so bad.
[5339.16s -> 5339.72s]  No, I'm not.
[5339.72s -> 5340.28s]  I'm...
[5340.28s -> 5341.56s]  All right, I'm kicking into overdrive.
[5341.56s -> 5342.44s]  I'm going for real.
[5342.44s -> 5344.76s]  You're going to die so many times.
[5344.76s -> 5345.32s]  Like, no, I'm not.
[5345.32s -> 5345.80s]  No, I'm not.
[5345.80s -> 5346.36s]  Watch this.
[5346.36s -> 5346.76s]  If I get...
[5346.76s -> 5349.56s]  Okay, if I take one fucking damage from here on out,
[5351.32s -> 5351.80s]  I will...
[5352.52s -> 5353.40s]  I will eat...
[5353.40s -> 5353.96s]  I will do...
[5353.96s -> 5356.72s]  I will do chubby bunny with marshmallows.
[5356.72s -> 5357.44s]  Like, in a week.
[5358.43s -> 5360.83s]  And I'll do a chubby bunny thing with marshmallows.
[5360.83s -> 5379.47s]  Hey, Jerma sucks.
[5379.47s -> 5380.59s]  Thanks for five subs.
[5380.59s -> 5393.85s]  Go back in, going this way.
[5400.83s -> 5402.67s]  Remember, I didn't say if I get spotted.
[5402.99s -> 5404.35s]  If I take damage...
[5404.35s -> 5427.84s]  Where the fuck is he going?
[5427.84s -> 5442.40s]  But no, if I don't care.
[5442.40s -> 5451.18s]  Who's in here?
[5451.18s -> 5455.24s]  Oh, shit.
[5455.24s -> 5455.72s]  I got to hide him.
[5455.72s -> 5465.31s]  I got to hide his body.
[5465.31s -> 5465.87s]  One...
[5465.87s -> 5468.75s]  Okay, we got one, two, three, four.
[5468.75s -> 5469.47s]  Oh, no.
[5469.47s -> 5470.59s]  There's a lot of people in here.
[5470.59s -> 5473.60s]  How many...
[5473.60s -> 5476.70s]  I used all my molotovs.
[5476.70s -> 5477.02s]  Shit.
[5477.02s -> 5477.82s]  Of course I did.
[5477.82s -> 5480.43s]  Okay, what if I shoot this guy in the head right now?
[5480.43s -> 5485.95s]  I didn't take any damage yet.
[5485.95s -> 5491.90s]  I didn't take any damage.
[5491.90s -> 5493.58s]  Fuck, chubby bunny.
[5494.22s -> 5506.75s]  I don't want to do that.
[5506.75s -> 5507.39s]  I don't want to do that.
[5507.39s -> 5509.55s]  Why didn't I say like 100 community subs?
[5509.55s -> 5510.75s]  I would rather do that.
[5510.75s -> 5514.08s]  I would rather give 100 community subs to this channel
[5514.72s -> 5515.93s]  Let's go.
[5515.93s -> 5517.05s]  Then do chubby bunny.
[5518.67s -> 5519.79s]  He wants to see that.
[5519.79s -> 5520.91s]  I don't want to see that.
[5520.91s -> 5521.71s]  And neither do you.
[5530.43s -> 5532.59s]  Fuck, I didn't think there was going to be like 10 people here.
[5533.15s -> 5546.75s]  Give me the knife.
[5546.75s -> 5551.53s]  I don't have any marshmallows.
[5551.53s -> 5552.49s]  I can't do it right now.
[5553.13s -> 5554.25s]  All right, give me the knife.
[5554.25s -> 5564.84s]  How come there's not a Metal Gear Solid like...
[5565.64s -> 5566.44s]  Huh?
[5566.44s -> 5574.68s]  Stab him.
[5574.68s -> 5580.11s]  Stab him in the head.
[5580.11s -> 5582.40s]  Oh, shit.
[5582.40s -> 5582.88s]  That guy's a gun.
[5584.20s -> 5585.24s]  Why wouldn't you have shot me?
[5588.56s -> 5589.12s]  Oh, fuck.
[5589.12s -> 5590.08s]  It's on hard mode.
[5590.08s -> 5591.52s]  It's on really difficult.
[5591.52s -> 5593.44s]  It's on classic mode, which is really hard.
[5593.44s -> 5594.88s]  Okay, I'm going to get it this time.
[5595.44s -> 5605.24s]  He's actually so bad at video games.
[5605.24s -> 5607.48s]  No, I'm on the mode where if you take one shot, you die.
[5610.20s -> 5610.84s]  Not this time.
[5610.84s -> 5611.32s]  Here we go.
[5628.19s -> 5629.31s]  Use the gun?
[5629.31s -> 5648.38s]  I don't need a gun.
[5648.38s -> 5650.30s]  All right, there's three guys downstairs.
[5650.30s -> 5653.04s]  Nobody in this bed.
[5653.04s -> 5654.24s]  Can I get anything in this...
[5654.24s -> 5655.68s]  What do you mean we'll find him?
[5655.68s -> 5660.73s]  Is there an animal out there?
[5660.73s -> 5663.90s]  Wait, that's the raccoon.
[5663.90s -> 5665.02s]  That was causing all the noise.
[5665.02s -> 5665.98s]  Right, okay.
[5665.98s -> 5673.50s]  Anybody coming?
[5673.50s -> 5683.00s]  All right, we're good.
[5683.00s -> 5683.88s]  They sneaking.
[5683.88s -> 5689.79s]  I think there's a guy in here.
[5689.79s -> 5692.60s]  Yep, there's a guy out here.
[5692.60s -> 5693.32s]  I know there is.
[5693.32s -> 5704.73s]  There's reach for the window?
[5704.73s -> 5720.73s]  I'm trying to hit the fucking fox.
[5720.73s -> 5721.53s]  All right, what am I doing?
[5731.07s -> 5732.11s]  Is there nobody else up here?
[5732.11s -> 5737.76s]  There's a guy checking over there.
[5737.76s -> 5738.32s]  Checking over there.
[5738.32s -> 5741.80s]  Checking over there.
[5741.80s -> 5767.24s]  All right, it's gun time.
[5767.24s -> 5768.28s]  You have a DDT.
[5768.28s -> 5781.04s]  Oh, what?
[5781.04s -> 5782.24s]  It's a fake.
[5782.24s -> 5798.14s]  What the fuck just happened?
[5798.14s -> 5799.18s]  That was another player.
[5800.89s -> 5801.37s]  Stop it.
[5803.08s -> 5807.69s]  Why are you coming from?
[5810.73s -> 5811.05s]  What?
[5822.51s -> 5823.15s]  Open door?
[5823.71s -> 5824.51s]  They're all in there?
[5824.51s -> 5826.83s]  They're all just clown card into the room.
[5829.87s -> 5833.36s]  Okay, keyboard and mouse.
[5833.36s -> 5835.44s]  Oh, not fucking around anymore.
[5835.44s -> 5836.08s]  Here we go.
[5836.08s -> 5836.96s]  FPS mode.
[5836.96s -> 5846.09s]  Fuck this.
[5846.09s -> 5847.61s]  Why did he fall off?
[5847.61s -> 5855.48s]  Where you at?
[5855.48s -> 5861.61s]  Come on out.
[5861.61s -> 5862.25s]  Let's go.
[5862.25s -> 5868.43s]  Why is my sensitivity so high?
[5868.43s -> 5869.63s]  Because I didn't even change it.
[5879.42s -> 5880.06s]  So high.
[5887.04s -> 5887.84s]  Okay, hold on.
[5887.84s -> 5888.64s]  I got to fix that.
[5888.64s -> 5890.73s]  It's unbelievably high.
[5890.73s -> 5891.45s]  Game.
[5891.45s -> 5893.32s]  Controls.
[5893.32s -> 5894.60s]  Mouse sensitivity.
[5894.60s -> 5895.10s]  Yikes.
[5921.55s -> 5922.11s]  I can't.
[5922.11s -> 5923.63s]  I got to get through the first mission.
[5923.63s -> 5925.23s]  What do you mean pretending?
[5925.23s -> 5927.39s]  The guy just like glued to my body
[5927.39s -> 5929.31s]  and swung twice and hit me in the head and I died.
[5929.31s -> 5957.36s]  There's a guy right here.
[5957.36s -> 5962.16s]  How do you crouch?
[5962.72s -> 5970.14s]  Okay, fucking god damn it.
[5970.14s -> 5985.61s]  Just open the fucking door and die.
[5985.61s -> 5986.33s]  Got him.
[5986.33s -> 5996.36s]  I'm over here.
[5999.69s -> 6009.92s]  Where's somebody shooting?
[6009.92s -> 6014.59s]  I thought somebody was on the roof.
[6014.59s -> 6015.79s]  What the hell just happened?
[6015.79s -> 6016.91s]  Somebody shot me.
[6016.91s -> 6017.71s]  What happened?
[6017.71s -> 6023.32s]  I hear a guy sprinting.
[6023.32s -> 6023.96s]  I hear a guy sprinting.
[6023.96s -> 6024.84s]  I hear somebody sprinting.
[6024.84s -> 6035.77s]  Somebody sprinting.
[6035.77s -> 6040.99s]  I need help.
[6040.99s -> 6051.58s]  Nice.
[6051.58s -> 6052.62s]  Okay, we're good.
[6052.62s -> 6053.10s]  Oh, fuck.
[6053.10s -> 6053.82s]  Hold on.
[6053.82s -> 6062.72s]  This is fun.
[6062.72s -> 6068.64s]  All right, there's like one more guy in here
[6068.64s -> 6069.60s]  and then we're good.
[6069.60s -> 6086.88s]  Where is he?
[6086.88s -> 6088.92s]  Oh, okay, we're good.
[6088.92s -> 6090.20s]  One guy behind the pool table.
[6090.20s -> 6092.22s]  By the way, it's one of my favorite games.
[6092.22s -> 6094.76s]  Hiding behind my favorite game.
[6094.76s -> 6098.19s]  That it?
[6120.22s -> 6121.58s]  It was fucking hard.
[6121.58s -> 6122.94s]  Uh-oh, guy with a duffel bag.
[6130.92s -> 6132.20s]  Oh no, more of this.
[6133.16s -> 6137.07s]  Oh, got knocked over into your favorite game.
[6139.47s -> 6145.39s]  Don't run up over for a joke.
[6146.11s -> 6152.78s]  Shoot while driving.
[6153.42s -> 6161.37s]  No, don't shoot that person's car.
[6161.37s -> 6161.93s]  What did they do?
[6162.57s -> 6166.20s]  Somebody leaning out of the car trying to shoot at me?
[6166.92s -> 6169.64s]  This person's just in the fucking way.
[6184.46s -> 6185.50s]  Shoot at everyone.
[6198.73s -> 6199.69s]  Come on, dude.
[6201.63s -> 6203.15s]  Why?
[6204.59s -> 6206.99s]  Just use the car as a gun.
[6207.95s -> 6208.67s]  Catch the thug.
[6208.67s -> 6210.59s]  I'm going as fast as I can, man.
[6211.31s -> 6222.76s]  How am I supposed to shoot the guys?
[6223.88s -> 6224.76s]  Oh my god.
[6226.52s -> 6227.56s]  Stupid.
[6228.94s -> 6229.58s]  All right, we're good.
[6234.91s -> 6248.94s]  All right, wait till it gets like the indicator.
[6249.58s -> 6255.18s]  I'm just, I can't even aim this.
[6255.18s -> 6257.42s]  It's just, I guess I'm shooting at the back of their car.
[6258.30s -> 6264.51s]  That's why for a speed boost.
[6268.43s -> 6269.55s]  Spam it.
[6269.55s -> 6270.83s]  I don't think that's going to do anything for me.
[6270.83s -> 6279.64s]  Fucking asshole game.
[6280.36s -> 6282.01s]  It's not rocket science.
[6282.01s -> 6283.69s]  I was doing it.
[6287.39s -> 6292.99s]  I know, guys, I've been in this chair for like 30 years playing video games.
[6292.99s -> 6297.40s]  I know that you shoot the car, but I can't even aim the gun.
[6300.57s -> 6301.45s]  Got him.
[6301.45s -> 6305.47s]  I've been in this chair for 30 years.
[6319.13s -> 6320.01s]  Oh shit.
[6320.81s -> 6327.95s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[6328.51s -> 6331.07s]  Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please don't do this to me.
[6331.87s -> 6335.40s]  Fucking aiming and driving with a controller.
[6335.40s -> 6339.24s]  I may as well dunk my head under water and fucking just start gulping.
[6355.74s -> 6357.90s]  I may as well just put my head under water and scream.
[6366.46s -> 6367.82s]  Okay, this is the one right here.
[6367.82s -> 6368.22s]  This is the one.
[6375.56s -> 6376.76s]  Oh fucking, I can't.
[6376.76s -> 6378.36s]  I hope you guys forget about the chubby bunny thing.
[6378.36s -> 6378.84s]  I really do.
[6396.11s -> 6396.91s]  Am I even hitting him?
[6405.69s -> 6406.73s]  I'm hitting him, I guess.
[6407.53s -> 6423.37s]  I don't hit a fucking tree.
[6423.37s -> 6424.09s]  I love a god.
[6424.73s -> 6437.58s]  All right, I got it.
[6437.58s -> 6437.82s]  I got it.
[6437.82s -> 6438.22s]  This is the one.
[6438.22s -> 6438.54s]  This is the one.
[6438.54s -> 6439.02s]  This is the run.
[6448.44s -> 6449.24s]  Watch out for the rocks.
[6467.32s -> 6467.88s]  Come on, dude.
[6467.88s -> 6468.20s]  Really?
[6471.32s -> 6471.56s]  Out.
[6472.12s -> 6473.40s]  You're not turning to me.
[6473.40s -> 6481.87s]  Is he dead?
[6481.87s -> 6482.51s]  Search the car.
[6482.51s -> 6482.91s]  Get out.
[6497.13s -> 6498.01s]  30 years in this chair.
[6498.01s -> 6498.89s]  That's how you show up.
[6498.89s -> 6500.25s]  Everybody how you do it.
[6500.25s -> 6500.65s]  All right.
[6500.65s -> 6503.05s]  That was a really bad victory fucking exclamation.
[6503.05s -> 6508.75s]  I don't know what the hell I was trying to say.
[6508.75s -> 6509.39s]  Chapter complete.
[6510.65s -> 6511.53s]  Intermezzo.
[6524.51s -> 6527.07s]  30 years just to do a chubby bunny stream.
[6529.56s -> 6531.00s]  That's going to be so embarrassing.
[6544.51s -> 6546.75s]  Thanks, you boy, for the 10 community subs.
[6547.95s -> 6548.43s]  Raglan.
[6548.43s -> 6548.93s]  Thank you.
[6550.67s -> 6551.95s]  10 subs dropped right now.
[6553.07s -> 6553.55s]  Thanks a lot.
[6554.99s -> 6555.87s]  Have the run of the city.
[6556.43s -> 6558.27s]  For every buck sellier he made.
[6558.27s -> 6560.11s]  Don Morello would turn 10.
[6560.11s -> 6564.11s]  He paid off cops, politicians, judges, and anyone he couldn't buy.
[6564.11s -> 6565.71s]  He scared him to look in the other way.
[6566.35s -> 6567.79s]  Kermit, that can actually kill you.
[6567.79s -> 6569.71s]  It's not the city jumping in its own shadow.
[6569.71s -> 6570.43s]  I'll give you that.
[6571.23s -> 6571.47s]  What?
[6571.47s -> 6573.15s]  Do you hear anything about Joey Crackers?
[6573.95s -> 6575.47s]  Yeah, got his name in the Moretto file.
[6575.47s -> 6576.03s]  Sure.
[6576.03s -> 6576.83s]  Boxer, right?
[6577.63s -> 6578.13s]  Yeah.
[6578.91s -> 6579.55s]  That's the guy.
[6580.35s -> 6582.11s]  I could die from chubby bunny.
[6582.91s -> 6587.04s]  Kids have died doing chubby bunny before.
[6594.35s -> 6595.15s]  I'll be very careful.
[6595.71s -> 6596.99s]  I'll dunk him in water first.
[6609.10s -> 6610.06s]  No, I'm not going to eat them.
[6614.94s -> 6620.41s]  I'm going to turn the cam off and I'm going to do a big smear puke out of my mouth.
[6622.49s -> 6623.53s]  Into like a trash can.
[6628.88s -> 6629.60s]  My fault.
[6629.60s -> 6634.67s]  No, I just, I just, I ain't never been in no accident.
[6635.61s -> 6638.57s]  Well, repairs are going to be expensive.
[6639.45s -> 6643.29s]  Oh, you're not going to need that, sir.
[6643.93s -> 6644.73s]  Tires are just fine.
[6645.37s -> 6646.49s]  Grill's a little bent up is all.
[6646.49s -> 6647.45s]  I mean, I got a cousin I could...
[6648.73s -> 6649.23s]  What?
[6650.49s -> 6657.64s]  And that's how you went to jail for the rest of your life.
[6660.03s -> 6660.53s]  Hey.
[6661.15s -> 6673.10s]  Someone spun you a tale, pal.
[6673.66s -> 6678.22s]  You got an informant right there says Morello made a mint every time Crackers went to the mat.
[6678.22s -> 6679.02s]  That's true, too.
[6679.82s -> 6683.42s]  And still Morello left that poor, sad, dead in the street.
[6683.42s -> 6686.70s]  Pizza Hut, a warm-up box thing when they delivered the pizza.
[6687.26s -> 6688.54s]  All right, I wasn't paying attention.
[6688.54s -> 6689.74s]  I could've, I could've been funnier.
[6689.74s -> 6692.30s]  Maybe to Don, though Joey's career was on the downhill.
[6692.30s -> 6694.22s]  Maybe he was trying to scare someone, a guy in a pay-in-off.
[6694.22s -> 6694.72s]  Who knows?
[6695.74s -> 6699.42s]  Don Celieri chalked it up to Morello not being able to think straight when he was mad.
[6699.42s -> 6701.58s]  I love when people get so pissed off.
[6702.78s -> 6705.34s]  It's just like, what the fuck is he talking about?
[6705.34s -> 6707.10s]  Do you have any more run-ins with...
[6707.10s -> 6708.22s]  It gives me energy.
[6708.86s -> 6709.50s]  Not at first.
[6710.14s -> 6713.23s]  For a couple of years after I joined up, things were quiet.
[6714.03s -> 6716.43s]  We got into a few dust-ups with guys trying to muscle in.
[6716.43s -> 6718.99s]  But else-wise, it was just the usual routine.
[6718.99s -> 6721.10s]  Who's out for protection?
[6721.10s -> 6723.50s]  Me and the boys doing rounds to collect small time.
[6723.50s -> 6723.90s]  What is it?
[6723.90s -> 6725.02s]  What is it, Chubby Bunny?
[6725.02s -> 6726.38s]  I ain't gonna lie.
[6726.38s -> 6731.74s]  You get marshmallows and you put them in your cheeks and you say Chubby Bunny after you put one in.
[6732.46s -> 6734.25s]  I'm not gonna do that many.
[6734.25s -> 6736.49s]  I'm not gonna do a dangerous amount of marshmallows.
[6736.49s -> 6739.13s]  Guys, I'm not gonna put enough marshmallows to kill me in my mouth.
[6739.13s -> 6742.09s]  I'm just gonna do enough for it to be accurate.
[6776.38s -> 6777.34s]  It's a great investment.
[6777.34s -> 6779.90s]  The kid can't lose a race if he walks the track.
[6780.54s -> 6785.10s]  He graduates from the Junkers to Gowjobs, and I start placing a few bets on him here and there.
[6785.10s -> 6787.90s]  Next thing I know, I've made all my money back and more.
[6788.46s -> 6790.38s]  Hey, Sam says he's the guy to beat.
[6790.38s -> 6790.88s]  He was.
[6791.74s -> 6793.98s]  We ran all the competition out of town.
[6793.98s -> 6795.50s]  But now Ralph says there's a hot-sock European...
[6795.50s -> 6796.38s]  Here it comes.
[6796.38s -> 6797.26s]  Here it comes.
[6797.26s -> 6797.74s]  Oh, fuck.
[6797.74s -> 6799.82s]  And he's got a car faster than our boys...
[6799.82s -> 6801.18s]  Five-hour mission.
[6801.18s -> 6801.42s]  Okay.
[6801.42s -> 6802.94s]  How much do we stand to lose?
[6802.94s -> 6803.66s]  A truckload.
[6804.22s -> 6805.98s]  But not just our outfit.
[6805.98s -> 6809.52s]  A lot of guys from the neighborhood come to me for financial advice.
[6809.52s -> 6811.76s]  They've all put money down on this kid.
[6811.76s -> 6815.20s]  It'll be like Black Thursday around here if he loses.
[6816.00s -> 6818.48s]  Well, for everyone except Morello.
[6818.48s -> 6820.08s]  No, you think he's from the European?
[6820.08s -> 6820.80s]  Oh, I'm certain of it.
[6820.80s -> 6822.72s]  Odd friends, skip 10 hours.
[6822.72s -> 6824.48s]  He wants something to happen to the driver.
[6824.48s -> 6825.20s]  Can't find him.
[6825.20s -> 6829.44s]  You're giving me a lot of power here to want to beat this really, really quickly and really skillfully.
[6829.44s -> 6830.72s]  ...disappears now?
[6830.72s -> 6832.24s]  None of our wagers will stand.
[6832.24s -> 6834.75s]  Five fouls and a race is fixed.
[6834.75s -> 6837.52s]  What about his car?
[6837.52s -> 6839.72s]  That's the ticket, Tommy.
[6839.72s -> 6842.44s]  Ralph knows a guard at the track.
[6842.44s -> 6847.16s]  You go down there tonight, you boost the Europeans' car, bring it to one of our mechanics.
[6847.16s -> 6849.08s]  I'll make a few adjustments when you bring the car back.
[6849.08s -> 6850.28s]  Should be no problem, boss.
[6854.14s -> 6854.64s]  Okay.
[6856.14s -> 6856.78s]  Talk to Ralph.
[6865.58s -> 6869.58s]  Odd viewers, skip to two hours and 36 minutes and 14 seconds for the next mission.
[6873.44s -> 6874.40s]  That's very specific.
[6885.12s -> 6887.37s]  Hey, Titi Tommy.
[6887.37s -> 6888.65s]  Big day coming up, right?
[6889.53s -> 6890.33s]  Hey, no.
[6890.33s -> 6891.13s]  Time traveler.
[6891.13s -> 6892.25s]  Kinda hard to miss.
[6892.25s -> 6892.81s]  I'm still here.
[6892.81s -> 6895.13s]  He isn't going to let Morello break his winning streak, huh?
[6895.13s -> 6896.17s]  No, no, sir.
[6896.17s -> 6898.01s]  I had to send him a message.
[6898.01s -> 6902.14s]  So tonight, borrow his guy's motor from the track.
[6902.14s -> 6903.82s]  My friend Bobby is a guard.
[6903.82s -> 6908.78s]  For a little dough, he'll show you where it is and look someplace else while you t-t-t-turn the key.
[6908.78s -> 6910.06s]  You like Bobby already?
[6911.02s -> 6911.52s]  Sure.
[6911.98s -> 6914.86s]  Get in there, there's a Sutter guy, L-L-Lucas Bertone.
[6914.94s -> 6918.46s]  You take the car to him down under the Ju-Ju-Giuliano Bridge.
[6918.46s -> 6920.78s]  He'll, you know, tune it a little.
[6920.78s -> 6923.18s]  Make the race tomorrow more, more, more interesting.
[6923.18s -> 6927.02s]  Then I take the car straight back and Bobby can stop looking someplace else.
[6927.02s -> 6928.38s]  But you gotta be quick.
[6928.38s -> 6933.26s]  Bobby comes off shift at 1.30 and then the next guy, he's an ass.
[6933.26s -> 6935.26s]  Am I saying the Travis Scott Burger?
[6935.26s -> 6937.02s]  This mission made me cry growing up.
[6937.02s -> 6941.82s]  Hey, if you need somewhere to keep your m-motor seat where no one can take them,
[6941.82s -> 6943.34s]  feel free to use the garage.
[6943.34s -> 6944.99s]  Oh, because you just saw the ad.
[6945.07s -> 6946.59s]  Right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right.
[6946.59s -> 6951.26s]  Everyone saying that just saw the ad.
[6951.26s -> 6955.66s]  Right, right, I forgot.
[6955.66s -> 6956.30s]  Oh, shit.
[6957.02s -> 6957.34s]  All right.
[6958.14s -> 6958.86s]  What do I got?
[6958.86s -> 6960.14s]  Taxi, six, the V8.
[6962.01s -> 6963.05s]  Yeah, I want the V8, man.
[6963.05s -> 6963.53s]  You kidding me?
[6963.53s -> 6964.17s]  This thing's sick.
[6968.08s -> 6969.92s]  Add V8s to the garage by driving them.
[6971.04s -> 6972.08s]  Meet with the guard at the racetrack.
[6972.08s -> 6972.96s]  All right, this is a fast car.
[6973.52s -> 6980.72s]  This is the last mission everybody plays before dropping the game.
[6984.65s -> 6985.15s]  Okay.
[6986.09s -> 6993.98s]  This is the second mission in the whole game, realistically speaking.
[6994.70s -> 6996.35s]  Can you pass on the left in the 30s?
[6998.59s -> 6999.09s]  Yes.
[6999.41s -> 7008.93s]  I want a motorcycle so bad.
[7008.93s -> 7009.73s]  I want- I'm gonna do-
[7009.73s -> 7010.85s]  No, I'm gonna do motorcycle.
[7010.85s -> 7011.25s]  No, I'm not.
[7011.25s -> 7012.05s]  It's gone already.
[7012.05s -> 7012.55s]  Never mind.
[7013.25s -> 7024.59s]  You guys are really talking up this mission.
[7025.31s -> 7030.88s]  Dude, I gotta prepare for this then.
[7031.52s -> 7049.46s]  A long way away, isn't it?
[7050.18s -> 7057.30s]  All right, here we go.
[7057.30s -> 7063.71s]  You Bobby?
[7063.71s -> 7064.51s]  Yep.
[7064.51s -> 7066.03s]  We can take your car to the garage.
[7066.03s -> 7066.91s]  Place is empty.
[7066.91s -> 7067.95s]  What, I have to suit this thing up?
[7067.95s -> 7069.07s]  Your friend Ralphie's a friend of mine.
[7069.07s -> 7070.27s]  I mean, if you got the money, sure.
[7071.23s -> 7076.74s]  30 years of gaming about to come to an end.
[7076.74s -> 7078.10s]  Tomorrow morning they start coming.
[7078.66s -> 7079.94s]  Whole city.
[7079.94s -> 7080.98s]  They smuggle in hooch.
[7081.62s -> 7082.34s]  There's fighting.
[7082.82s -> 7084.72s]  I hate it.
[7084.72s -> 7086.16s]  Ah, come mine.
[7086.16s -> 7089.44s]  Name a better place to pick up a date than this place this weekend.
[7089.44s -> 7090.40s]  Don't get me started.
[7091.63s -> 7092.83s]  Big brain cigarettes?
[7093.55s -> 7100.48s]  All right, here we are.
[7101.04s -> 7104.30s]  This is it.
[7104.30s -> 7111.55s]  All right, I'm just stretching.
[7111.55s -> 7120.35s]  Ooh, there she is.
[7120.35s -> 7122.19s]  99 Karazela C-Series.
[7122.19s -> 7123.39s]  Best in class.
[7123.39s -> 7125.44s]  It's a shame you gotta wreck it.
[7125.44s -> 7126.94s]  If they see this down the road,
[7127.74s -> 7129.10s]  the cops are gonna ask questions.
[7129.90s -> 7132.94s]  Try to keep it in one piece, too.
[7132.94s -> 7134.62s]  Try to keep it in one piece and-
[7134.62s -> 7136.70s]  So, I gotta be back from Breton by 1.30
[7136.70s -> 7137.82s]  before the next guy shifts.
[7138.62s -> 7140.45s]  Yeah.
[7140.45s -> 7141.49s]  It's timed, is that what it is?
[7142.13s -> 7142.77s]  It's timed.
[7142.77s -> 7143.73s]  Okay, let's go.
[7144.69s -> 7161.54s]  We're good.
[7161.54s -> 7163.84s]  Just keep the car in one piece, get back in two minutes.
[7173.41s -> 7175.41s]  Holy shit, this thing is fast.
[7182.38s -> 7182.94s]  It's all right.
[7182.94s -> 7184.38s]  I got one guy looking at me.
[7184.94s -> 7198.88s]  We're good.
[7198.88s -> 7199.60s]  So far, so good.
[7200.32s -> 7201.60s]  I'm at 50% damage.
[7206.88s -> 7208.56s]  Oh, get this thing out of the way.
[7208.56s -> 7209.28s]  What the fuck are you doing?
[7218.64s -> 7219.44s]  I got a full minute.
[7220.00s -> 7221.04s]  We're gonna take shortcut.
[7221.76s -> 7230.46s]  Shit.
[7230.46s -> 7232.14s]  Shortcut to the checkpoint is what I meant.
[7232.62s -> 7239.62s]  Restart.
[7239.62s -> 7240.58s]  Already don't like it.
[7240.58s -> 7242.14s]  Bad start.
[7242.14s -> 7242.54s]  Bad start.
[7242.54s -> 7243.02s]  All right.
[7243.02s -> 7243.66s]  Really bad start.
[7243.66s -> 7244.14s]  Just restart.
[7244.86s -> 7247.68s]  Or not.
[7247.68s -> 7248.00s]  Let's see.
[7248.56s -> 7251.50s]  All right.
[7251.50s -> 7252.62s]  The handling is insane.
[7252.62s -> 7253.42s]  So, just slow down.
[7254.22s -> 7270.66s]  How do I re-
[7270.66s -> 7271.62s]  Just restart from checkpoint.
[7281.82s -> 7283.10s]  Punch yourself in the face?
[7285.95s -> 7286.35s]  All right.
[7286.35s -> 7286.75s]  Easy.
[7286.75s -> 7287.47s]  Don't go crazy.
[7288.03s -> 7290.46s]  You probably don't have to go that fast.
[7290.46s -> 7292.22s]  It's just addicting to go fast in this game.
[7293.18s -> 7293.50s]  Okay.
[7293.50s -> 7294.30s]  Slow down.
[7294.30s -> 7294.78s]  Big turn.
[7295.58s -> 7301.68s]  That was stupid.
[7301.68s -> 7309.22s]  I touched the bumper.
[7309.22s -> 7309.46s]  Okay.
[7309.46s -> 7310.90s]  So, bounce me across the whole game.
[7311.70s -> 7320.14s]  I just gotta get good car spawns and I'll be fine.
[7320.86s -> 7327.20s]  Pass this guy on the right and then lean to the left a little.
[7328.16s -> 7328.72s]  The right, I mean.
[7331.49s -> 7332.61s]  Sidewalk drive if you can.
[7333.33s -> 7335.20s]  Okay.
[7335.20s -> 7335.60s]  We're fine.
[7336.16s -> 7351.38s]  Right down the middle.
[7351.38s -> 7353.82s]  Right down the middle.
[7353.82s -> 7354.06s]  Right.
[7354.62s -> 7355.28s]  Slow down.
[7355.84s -> 7359.54s]  Losing control.
[7360.18s -> 7381.30s]  I got one minute.
[7381.30s -> 7388.08s]  How much further is it?
[7388.64s -> 7395.34s]  It's right there.
[7395.34s -> 7395.82s]  It's right there.
[7395.82s -> 7397.02s]  I got 39 seconds.
[7397.02s -> 7397.98s]  Hardest mission in the game.
[7397.98s -> 7398.54s]  You kidding me?
[7398.54s -> 7398.94s]  I'm done.
[7399.50s -> 7410.70s]  It was so hard.
[7410.70s -> 7410.94s]  Yeah.
[7410.94s -> 7412.22s]  I mean, it was tricky.
[7412.94s -> 7421.04s]  Oh, that's not a garage door that opens.
[7421.04s -> 7421.76s]  Oh, shit.
[7430.66s -> 7430.98s]  I'm good.
[7435.41s -> 7436.21s]  We don't have much time.
[7437.28s -> 7439.20s]  Hey, I'm a fast worker.
[7439.20s -> 7439.76s]  Sit tight.
[7446.66s -> 7447.22s]  Hey, hey.
[7447.22s -> 7448.02s]  You want a health stick?
[7448.66s -> 7449.06s]  Yeah, sure.
[7449.06s -> 7450.34s]  I'll take a health stick.
[7450.34s -> 7462.38s]  Okay.
[7462.38s -> 7462.70s]  Now what?
[7462.70s -> 7463.26s]  Thanks, Lucas.
[7464.06s -> 7466.59s]  I gotta get back before anyone catches on.
[7466.59s -> 7468.11s]  This turns on with 10 seconds left.
[7468.11s -> 7469.07s]  I'm gonna laugh my ass off.
[7469.95s -> 7470.67s]  Misbehave.
[7472.18s -> 7474.58s]  Hey, tell Mr. Salieri.
[7474.58s -> 7476.58s]  I'm always available for this kind of work.
[7476.58s -> 7478.02s]  I do stuff for a lot of people.
[7478.58s -> 7480.42s]  But I always know where I stand with you guys.
[7482.24s -> 7482.88s]  Hot cars.
[7483.52s -> 7484.16s]  Getaways.
[7485.04s -> 7486.40s]  Anything for the right price.
[7486.96s -> 7488.96s]  Let's just hope Salieri's guy wins tomorrow.
[7490.16s -> 7491.92s]  For all our sakes.
[7492.64s -> 7493.20s]  Okay.
[7493.20s -> 7494.40s]  It's gonna misbehave.
[7494.40s -> 7495.12s]  I'm careful.
[7502.98s -> 7503.54s]  Two minutes.
[7505.65s -> 7506.69s]  Okay, I got two minutes.
[7507.33s -> 7510.80s]  It's gonna misbehave.
[7510.80s -> 7513.20s]  Is that what the engine indicator thing on top is supposed to mean?
[7513.92s -> 7514.94s]  What happens if it...
[7514.94s -> 7516.62s]  Okay, so it can't get that hot.
[7516.62s -> 7518.22s]  Don't hold the minigun down for that long.
[7518.86s -> 7530.08s]  This is an easy straightaway.
[7530.72s -> 7534.98s]  No, and shit just knocks you around too.
[7534.98s -> 7536.18s]  It bounces you around.
[7536.18s -> 7536.66s]  It's all right.
[7536.66s -> 7538.58s]  This is not as bad as I thought it was gonna be.
[7539.54s -> 7540.88s]  Pull it down.
[7540.88s -> 7541.36s]  Punch it.
[7541.92s -> 7551.68s]  To the right and then to the right.
[7552.83s -> 7553.23s]  Move.
[7554.03s -> 7562.35s]  All right.
[7562.35s -> 7563.71s]  Wrong side of the road.
[7563.71s -> 7565.07s]  That's where I shine the most.
[7583.74s -> 7584.91s]  I'm almost there.
[7584.91s -> 7585.39s]  I'm almost there.
[7585.39s -> 7586.03s]  Just get out of the way.
[7586.67s -> 7600.46s]  32 seconds.
[7600.46s -> 7600.86s]  I got it.
[7601.42s -> 7604.43s]  Move.
[7604.43s -> 7604.91s]  Out of the way.
[7605.47s -> 7606.82s]  Right here.
[7606.82s -> 7607.38s]  25 seconds.
[7608.02s -> 7609.71s]  Shortcut.
[7609.71s -> 7611.07s]  Should I do a shortcut or just do it?
[7619.33s -> 7619.97s]  12 seconds.
[7621.54s -> 7622.10s]  10 seconds.
[7624.27s -> 7624.91s]  8 seconds.
[7626.94s -> 7627.26s]  5.
[7627.90s -> 7628.22s]  4.
[7638.85s -> 7645.58s]  I thought I could go through the fence somehow.
[7645.58s -> 7645.82s]  All right.
[7645.82s -> 7646.30s]  Here we go.
[7651.04s -> 7651.68s]  Don't let up.
[7651.68s -> 7652.40s]  I'm gonna get there.
[7652.40s -> 7653.04s]  Here we go.
[7653.04s -> 7654.00s]  You know I should go the other way.
[7654.72s -> 7658.24s]  Idiot.
[7658.80s -> 7659.87s]  Fucking idiot.
[7659.87s -> 7660.83s]  That's not even my fault.
[7669.86s -> 7670.26s]  All right.
[7670.26s -> 7671.78s]  What happens if the thing goes all the way up?
[7671.78s -> 7672.58s]  Does it explode?
[7673.38s -> 7687.04s]  As long as I keep it under that bar, I'm fine.
[7688.75s -> 7689.95s]  Damage doesn't make it go higher.
[7690.51s -> 7690.99s]  I'm okay.
[7691.63s -> 7697.26s]  That was a pretty clean transition out of that spot.
[7697.26s -> 7697.98s]  That's a hard spot.
[7697.98s -> 7698.54s]  That's a hard turn.
[7704.26s -> 7705.06s]  Wrong side of the road.
[7711.17s -> 7711.81s]  Good.
[7711.81s -> 7715.06s]  Oh my god.
[7715.06s -> 7716.34s]  I almost just hit the side.
[7717.22s -> 7717.54s]  Sorry.
[7718.42s -> 7728.69s]  All right.
[7728.69s -> 7729.01s]  Watch out.
[7729.01s -> 7729.33s]  Watch out.
[7729.33s -> 7730.37s]  That rice-a-roni truck.
[7731.66s -> 7732.70s]  You dick.
[7732.70s -> 7732.86s]  Okay.
[7732.86s -> 7733.90s]  That's the part that's gonna be a problem.
[7733.90s -> 7749.74s]  I think I still got it.
[7749.74s -> 7757.10s]  20 seconds.
[7764.08s -> 7765.68s]  That was close.
[7765.68s -> 7767.28s]  I filled it all the way up.
[7767.28s -> 7768.56s]  That was really close.
[7768.56s -> 7771.52s]  That would have been a 500-yard shot if a golf game was in this.
[7778.98s -> 7779.62s]  Oh, dude.
[7779.62s -> 7780.42s]  This is impossible.
[7780.42s -> 7781.78s]  This mission's not even completable.
[7782.42s -> 7785.25s]  Did I win?
[7785.89s -> 7797.47s]  Come on.
[7797.47s -> 7802.56s]  Oh, wow.
[7803.12s -> 7804.32s]  You just get...
[7804.32s -> 7804.80s]  All right.
[7804.80s -> 7805.52s]  That's not bad.
[7814.53s -> 7815.33s]  All right.
[7815.33s -> 7818.27s]  That wasn't that bad.
[7818.35s -> 7820.27s]  Okay. Let's get out of here.
[7820.27s -> 7822.72s]  Big day tomorrow.
[7822.72s -> 7823.36s]  Oh, wow.
[7823.36s -> 7826.88s]  We just got a monster raid from Kitboga.
[7827.52s -> 7829.60s]  What's going on, guys?
[7829.60s -> 7830.80s]  Welcome to the stream.
[7830.80s -> 7832.16s]  Thank you, Kitboga, for the raid.
[7832.16s -> 7832.56s]  That's a...
[7832.56s -> 7833.84s]  Yeah, it's a monster raid.
[7834.48s -> 7837.30s]  Hope you had a good stream, dude.
[7837.30s -> 7839.34s]  So Sam walks out of the bathroom...
[7839.34s -> 7841.42s]  We're playing Mafia Remastered.
[7841.42s -> 7845.42s]  ...because our tenor's gonna hand over what he owes.
[7845.42s -> 7846.38s]  And his two sons...
[7846.38s -> 7847.02s]  Gonna be fun?
[7847.02s -> 7848.06s]  ...closer.
[7848.06s -> 7852.18s]  Some of the most fun I've had in a long time was on Kit's stream.
[7852.18s -> 7855.31s]  ...feel like brick shithouses.
[7855.31s -> 7856.91s]  The pleasure to have you here.
[7856.91s -> 7857.31s]  Welcome.
[7858.03s -> 7860.59s]  ...his crazy bastard.
[7860.59s -> 7863.86s]  He waltzes out of the bathroom and pisses it all over the joint.
[7863.86s -> 7864.50s]  Really?
[7864.50s -> 7865.86s]  Is this the actual hard part?
[7866.98s -> 7869.06s]  Sometimes you just gotta make him think you're crazy.
[7869.06s -> 7870.10s]  Yeah, pizza buddy raid.
[7870.10s -> 7870.66s]  That's right.
[7870.66s -> 7871.38s]  You got the moment.
[7874.27s -> 7875.39s]  Actual hard part?
[7877.15s -> 7877.47s]  You guys...
[7877.47s -> 7878.35s]  You can't...
[7878.35s -> 7879.15s]  Boy, who cried wolf.
[7880.96s -> 7882.08s]  First, it was the first part.
[7882.08s -> 7882.88s]  Oh, he's not gonna do it.
[7882.88s -> 7883.28s]  Second part.
[7883.28s -> 7883.92s]  Oh, it's impossible.
[7883.92s -> 7884.40s]  Third part.
[7884.40s -> 7884.96s]  It's impossible.
[7887.86s -> 7889.94s]  Stream chat that cried wolf.
[7889.94s -> 7890.26s]  I think.
[7909.76s -> 7910.40s]  He doesn't know.
[7911.12s -> 7912.24s]  Sing the raid song.
[7918.72s -> 7920.45s]  I don't have a raid song.
[7921.33s -> 7923.79s]  I have a follower song.
[7924.51s -> 7926.94s]  I don't know how it goes.
[7937.74s -> 7938.38s]  Fill the lyrics in.
[7938.38s -> 7939.10s]  You know how they go.
[7939.90s -> 7945.12s]  All right, so I have to just win the race.
[7945.84s -> 7948.67s]  But do I have to kill somebody in the race or what?
[7959.31s -> 7960.11s]  Just win.
[7960.11s -> 7960.35s]  Okay.
[7961.74s -> 7965.42s]  All right, if I hold it on the buzzer, do I get a boost like in Mario Kart?
[7966.14s -> 7969.84s]  Something's wrong with the car.
[7970.56s -> 7974.90s]  Just win the race.
[7978.32s -> 7984.29s]  I took that guy out.
[7984.29s -> 7985.73s]  That guy's not gonna race anymore.
[7986.29s -> 7990.34s]  It's crazy.
[7990.34s -> 7990.98s]  Okay, we're good.
[7990.98s -> 7991.30s]  We're good.
[7991.30s -> 7991.62s]  We're good.
[7991.62s -> 7992.58s]  We're good.
[7992.58s -> 7995.42s]  I got three laps to get to first place.
[7996.14s -> 8001.25s]  Shit.
[8003.74s -> 8004.86s]  Oh, it's too fast.
[8004.86s -> 8005.34s]  I see it.
[8005.34s -> 8006.22s]  Don't go that fast.
[8013.95s -> 8014.75s]  It's funny now.
[8015.47s -> 8019.63s]  But yeah, I'm probably going to be very, very agitated in about 10 minutes.
[8020.19s -> 8021.41s]  We're laughing now.
[8021.41s -> 8022.45s]  Oh, he hit the guy.
[8023.41s -> 8030.98s]  That funny moment is going to be a rage-inducing moment in about 15 minutes.
[8030.98s -> 8031.94s]  Just restart.
[8031.94s -> 8033.06s]  I've got this three laps.
[8034.80s -> 8035.36s]  I'm...
[8035.36s -> 8036.08s]  Look, I'm closing in.
[8036.08s -> 8036.48s]  I'm closing in.
[8036.48s -> 8036.96s]  I'm closing in.
[8050.51s -> 8050.91s]  Right?
[8050.91s -> 8051.31s]  That's...
[8051.31s -> 8052.43s]  Yeah, on my neck.
[8052.43s -> 8053.47s]  That would be very painful.
[8053.47s -> 8054.27s]  That would be horrible.
[8061.20s -> 8064.00s]  Nothing matters until the last 10 seconds of the race, guys.
[8064.00s -> 8064.48s]  Don't you know?
[8066.19s -> 8069.15s]  I could be two miles away in last place.
[8069.95s -> 8072.35s]  As long as I just come in first, who cares?
[8073.15s -> 8083.74s]  I mean, I'm very far away right now.
[8083.74s -> 8084.85s]  I'm gonna get lapped.
[8085.41s -> 8088.38s]  Are the other drivers still on the course?
[8102.00s -> 8102.56s]  Guys, yeah.
[8102.56s -> 8104.40s]  All I have to do is get a blue shell.
[8104.40s -> 8108.40s]  They give all the fucking losers back in 10th place blue shells.
[8108.40s -> 8108.96s]  I'll be fine.
[8116.69s -> 8117.65s]  Just restart.
[8117.65s -> 8118.21s]  Fine.
[8118.21s -> 8127.09s]  I need to get the cannon.
[8127.09s -> 8140.38s]  Yeah, the bullet bill where you just teleport through everybody.
[8140.38s -> 8141.26s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[8141.26s -> 8141.58s]  Skip.
[8147.28s -> 8149.14s]  One, two, three.
[8155.04s -> 8155.60s]  All right.
[8155.60s -> 8157.84s]  Just do it like every other racing game like this.
[8157.84s -> 8161.04s]  Just stay behind everybody and wait till there's a major crash.
[8161.04s -> 8163.76s]  And then just slowly go 10 miles per hour by everybody.
[8164.48s -> 8174.77s]  Hey, we're fine.
[8174.77s -> 8175.25s]  I'm still here.
[8176.85s -> 8177.97s]  Always pass on the inside.
[8178.69s -> 8188.96s]  Hey, I want to stay in like fifth to 10th place until the last 10 seconds.
[8189.92s -> 8191.04s]  I already have the strategy.
[8191.04s -> 8191.76s]  I already know what to do.
[8192.48s -> 8194.37s]  That guy's dead.
[8194.37s -> 8194.61s]  All right.
[8194.61s -> 8195.25s]  We got a crash.
[8195.25s -> 8195.81s]  We got a crash.
[8196.53s -> 8198.08s]  Easy.
[8198.08s -> 8198.64s]  10th place.
[8199.28s -> 8202.45s]  This is exactly where I want to be.
[8210.19s -> 8210.83s]  Good.
[8210.83s -> 8216.27s]  I don't want to be in first place.
[8219.90s -> 8229.04s]  That turn sucks.
[8229.76s -> 8238.24s]  It's not about going fast at all.
[8239.04s -> 8241.18s]  Just throwing.
[8241.18s -> 8242.46s]  Oh, I'm in ninth place.
[8242.46s -> 8243.42s]  I'm like halfway there.
[8244.38s -> 8251.01s]  All right.
[8251.01s -> 8251.81s]  Now punch it.
[8251.81s -> 8253.57s]  And then there's a huge that big turn here.
[8253.57s -> 8254.05s]  Okay, here we go.
[8254.05s -> 8255.49s]  We're going to lose two more people in front of us.
[8256.21s -> 8258.78s]  Oh, my God.
[8258.78s -> 8259.18s]  What do I do?
[8259.90s -> 8260.93s]  Oh, my God.
[8260.93s -> 8261.25s]  Oh, my God.
[8261.25s -> 8261.49s]  Oh, my God.
[8261.49s -> 8262.37s]  Oh, my God.
[8262.37s -> 8262.69s]  What?
[8265.06s -> 8269.54s]  My fucking God.
[8269.54s -> 8270.34s]  This is horrible.
[8278.90s -> 8279.46s]  Restart.
[8279.46s -> 8280.34s]  Not yet.
[8280.34s -> 8286.61s]  Once I know I once I can't see the car in front of me, I'll restart.
[8293.47s -> 8295.07s]  Does the fucking wheel even work?
[8295.87s -> 8298.51s]  I'm turning the car and I'm just going straight.
[8299.31s -> 8323.97s]  Yeah, it's a restart.
[8323.97s -> 8324.77s]  It has to be.
[8324.77s -> 8327.12s]  Holy shit.
[8327.12s -> 8327.84s]  This is ridiculous.
[8327.84s -> 8328.32s]  Okay, here we go.
[8332.35s -> 8332.75s]  New plan.
[8333.71s -> 8336.83s]  New plan is to cause a horrible, awful accident.
[8337.55s -> 8341.47s]  Just stuff myself into first place and just try to blow up like 10 of these cars.
[8343.01s -> 8343.73s]  Stay right here.
[8343.73s -> 8348.29s]  I'm going to just I'm going to just drive into the crowd like this, this group here.
[8353.81s -> 8358.88s]  Okay, well, it all did was take me out.
[8359.52s -> 8364.93s]  All right, I'm going to slow down.
[8364.93s -> 8369.06s]  That's unethical.
[8369.06s -> 8370.98s]  Well, I'm just trying to win.
[8378.72s -> 8379.68s]  Okay, I'm going to try.
[8379.68s -> 8380.88s]  I'm going to do very, very slow.
[8381.60s -> 8382.98s]  I have to drift and shit.
[8383.78s -> 8391.22s]  I don't have to start all the way back here.
[8391.22s -> 8392.02s]  That's so unfair.
[8393.82s -> 8394.94s]  I'm going to try some drifting.
[8406.61s -> 8407.57s]  Come on, stay with it.
[8408.72s -> 8410.72s]  These people are stopping in front of me.
[8410.72s -> 8412.64s]  They're actually holding their brakes down.
[8428.10s -> 8428.50s]  Dicks.
[8433.25s -> 8433.73s]  Okay.
[8433.73s -> 8434.85s]  All right, I'm going to be in 12.
[8437.41s -> 8438.69s]  Holy shit, we dodged that one.
[8450.67s -> 8452.11s]  Oh, most lost control.
[8463.95s -> 8465.55s]  Go with the crash, go with the crash, go with the crash.
[8466.19s -> 8485.20s]  I'm not in last place.
[8485.20s -> 8486.00s]  I'm in 14th.
[8486.72s -> 8497.25s]  Two people are dead.
[8498.43s -> 8514.91s]  So, how the fuck do you take this turn?
[8515.71s -> 8529.15s]  Use the brakes.
[8530.11s -> 8532.46s]  You can't use the gun.
[8532.46s -> 8533.18s]  I don't have a gun.
[8533.18s -> 8533.98s]  What are you talking about?
[8534.54s -> 8541.42s]  I'm going to go left side.
[8541.98s -> 8546.11s]  I'm going to go left side.
[8546.11s -> 8547.79s]  I'm going to try to pass everybody on the left.
[8552.80s -> 8554.48s]  I'm going to try to stay somewhere around 80.
[8560.27s -> 8562.27s]  Why is my car covered in fucking cooking oil?
[8562.27s -> 8563.63s]  Like, I don't, why can I, I don't understand.
[8564.43s -> 8565.63s]  What the fuck?
[8565.63s -> 8569.52s]  I was going slow.
[8569.52s -> 8570.48s]  The thing just spun out.
[8586.46s -> 8587.50s]  Bad traction.
[8587.50s -> 8588.78s]  Well, they have bad traction too.
[8588.78s -> 8589.26s]  It's not fair.
[8590.22s -> 8596.74s]  All right.
[8596.74s -> 8597.38s]  Let's try this again.
[8597.38s -> 8598.98s]  I was in like ninth or eighth place.
[8598.98s -> 8599.86s]  We're going to improve here.
[8601.06s -> 8602.34s]  This big turn is stupid.
[8602.98s -> 8604.88s]  And it gets rid of all the newbie players.
[8620.26s -> 8631.10s]  Slow down, omega low.
[8631.10s -> 8632.78s]  How fast do you think I was going right there?
[8632.78s -> 8635.74s]  I was going like 25 miles per hour.
[8641.94s -> 8642.82s]  We warned you.
[8647.87s -> 8650.27s]  So, is this one of those scenarios where this game,
[8650.27s -> 8652.43s]  when it was returned to Blockbuster was,
[8652.43s -> 8654.51s]  you know when you would buy a game or rent a game at Blockbuster,
[8654.51s -> 8655.95s]  it would have like a save file on it?
[8656.75s -> 8658.51s]  Was it just always on this save file?
[8659.39s -> 8660.67s]  You got to be fucking kidding me.
[8660.67s -> 8661.47s]  It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.
[8661.47s -> 8662.19s]  I got it, I got it, I got it.
[8687.82s -> 8688.70s]  Lightning McQueen?
[8697.09s -> 8698.93s]  Why, we're going to do the same thing as that guy.
[8705.71s -> 8706.11s]  Okay.
[8706.11s -> 8706.59s]  Hold on.
[8706.59s -> 8707.47s]  Let me see the mini map.
[8707.47s -> 8708.35s]  Can I see anybody yet?
[8718.62s -> 8719.34s]  Holy shit.
[8719.34s -> 8720.14s]  This is horrible.
[8724.54s -> 8725.98s]  This is what you guys are talking about.
[8731.41s -> 8732.13s]  Now he gets it.
[8734.91s -> 8736.27s]  Three laps, two.
[8736.27s -> 8737.71s]  What were they, why?
[8737.71s -> 8738.51s]  Why not just one?
[8739.31s -> 8740.67s]  Why do I have to do three of these?
[8741.39s -> 8743.95s]  Don't hold the gas down.
[8743.95s -> 8744.59s]  I'm not.
[8744.83s -> 8745.63s]  I'm being gentle.
[8764.99s -> 8766.43s]  Okay, we're good, kind of.
[8768.62s -> 8769.66s]  I guess, kind of.
[8774.46s -> 8776.30s]  That was very gentle, but I'm in last place.
[8777.02s -> 8782.86s]  Look, as long as I can see everybody, I don't even care.
[8783.50s -> 8789.54s]  All right, this guy is erratically driving.
[8790.10s -> 8797.34s]  I'm going a little too fast, but it's all right.
[8797.34s -> 8798.06s]  I'm just going to gain some ground.
[8798.06s -> 8799.10s]  I'm going to slow down right here.
[8799.10s -> 8800.70s]  Just coast, coast, coast, coast, coast, coast.
[8801.42s -> 8806.56s]  Come on, you guys are filling up the road.
[8806.56s -> 8807.12s]  Pass on the left.
[8807.76s -> 8810.03s]  Okay, slow.
[8812.50s -> 8813.06s]  Good.
[8813.06s -> 8814.50s]  All right, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good.
[8814.50s -> 8815.22s]  Slow, slow, slow, slow, slow.
[8815.22s -> 8815.78s]  Get out of my way.
[8817.06s -> 8817.94s]  He's connected to me.
[8817.94s -> 8818.74s]  He's connected to me.
[8818.74s -> 8819.86s]  You fucking connected to me.
[8821.71s -> 8824.43s]  That guy latched tires onto me and told me.
[8825.23s -> 8842.50s]  Hooked my tire with his tire.
[8842.50s -> 8843.86s]  That was better than the last attempt, though.
[8843.86s -> 8844.74s]  That was better than the last time.
[8845.46s -> 8850.18s]  He got stream sniped.
[8852.02s -> 8863.55s]  All right, here comes the famous difficult turn where every single AI can do it,
[8863.55s -> 8866.03s]  except for the one guy in the back who's the computer or non-computer player.
[8866.75s -> 8872.64s]  Nobody else has any trouble with that at all,
[8872.64s -> 8874.64s]  except for the one guy actually playing the fucking video game.
[8876.96s -> 8877.36s]  Famous.
[8878.08s -> 8894.77s]  All right, stay on the left side here.
[8894.77s -> 8896.45s]  Don't hook on to somebody.
[8897.73s -> 8899.60s]  We're okay.
[8900.16s -> 8903.20s]  All right, I'm doing way better than I was the last few times.
[8904.67s -> 8905.31s]  That's certain.
[8906.50s -> 8906.98s]  Slow down.
[8911.63s -> 8912.27s]  Get off of me.
[8912.91s -> 8913.39s]  Same guy.
[8914.11s -> 8924.74s]  Okay, that's always been the wall.
[8925.38s -> 8931.57s]  Still not in a bad spot.
[8931.57s -> 8940.69s]  Let's do this turn good.
[8947.47s -> 8947.71s]  Really?
[8952.90s -> 8954.50s]  Why are you guys all going so fast?
[8955.14s -> 8960.00s]  I think I'm the famous turn again.
[8960.00s -> 8960.80s]  All right, there's lap two.
[8960.80s -> 8962.00s]  I didn't crash yet.
[8962.00s -> 8962.48s]  That's good.
[8963.12s -> 8965.46s]  Jesus.
[8971.14s -> 8973.76s]  Dude, what the fuck is this mission?
[8974.32s -> 8975.12s]  What the hell?
[8975.92s -> 8984.37s]  Lower the difficulty?
[8984.37s -> 8985.57s]  How would that change the driving?
[8995.09s -> 8996.21s]  It's worse AI?
[8997.17s -> 8999.50s]  It actually is worse AI.
[9000.22s -> 9001.82s]  Classic is hard driving.
[9002.54s -> 9007.84s]  I'm going burger boy technique.
[9007.84s -> 9008.80s]  No, fuck all these tech.
[9008.80s -> 9010.32s]  No, screw every one of these.
[9010.96s -> 9012.00s]  These things you guys telling me.
[9012.00s -> 9013.04s]  Follow on burger boy technique.
[9013.04s -> 9013.36s]  Let's go.
[9021.33s -> 9027.78s]  The burger boy technique is you just don't give a shit.
[9028.42s -> 9047.91s]  Shit.
[9048.53s -> 9054.94s]  Here we go.
[9054.94s -> 9055.42s]  Right through.
[9056.22s -> 9056.62s]  12th.
[9057.50s -> 9057.90s]  11th.
[9065.60s -> 9066.80s]  Okay, we're fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.
[9066.80s -> 9067.68s]  Yeah, full, full throttle.
[9067.68s -> 9070.32s]  Throttle, throttle, throttle, throttle, throttle, throttle, throttle, throttle, throttle, throttle.
[9070.32s -> 9071.57s]  Watch out for this jump.
[9082.06s -> 9092.58s]  All right, we're still a fine.
[9092.58s -> 9093.14s]  This is all right.
[9093.78s -> 9094.72s]  Could be worse.
[9095.28s -> 9107.60s]  Let's follow the other drivers.
[9112.38s -> 9112.94s]  Too fast.
[9112.94s -> 9113.82s]  Way too fast.
[9114.38s -> 9115.66s]  Pull it back.
[9115.66s -> 9118.99s]  Of course, look at how fast that guy's going.
[9118.99s -> 9119.71s]  No matter to him.
[9120.35s -> 9123.72s]  Nice.
[9132.66s -> 9135.25s]  How many people uninstalled the game at this point?
[9135.25s -> 9136.29s]  You remade the game.
[9136.85s -> 9143.08s]  Hey, let's remake the game and make sure we get to a point where everybody fucking uninstalls it.
[9143.96s -> 9146.60s]  You don't see the next 14 hours of the story.
[9156.31s -> 9157.83s]  Being filtered.
[9157.83s -> 9159.11s]  Yeah, well, what the fuck?
[9160.39s -> 9161.83s]  I'm not lowering the difficulty yet.
[9161.83s -> 9162.33s]  Not yet.
[9163.03s -> 9170.72s]  That was an anger bump.
[9175.49s -> 9177.01s]  Yeah, get the fuck out of my way.
[9177.65s -> 9178.45s]  Get out of my way.
[9179.09s -> 9182.48s]  Put this hay here.
[9199.44s -> 9200.88s]  I'm never going to get to fifth place.
[9203.32s -> 9206.36s]  I need like a TAS to be able to complete this mission.
[9206.92s -> 9244.37s]  I tried driving on the road.
[9245.17s -> 9245.81s]  Yeah, I have.
[9256.82s -> 9258.26s]  Dude, what the fuck?
[9258.90s -> 9259.30s]  Why?
[9259.94s -> 9262.18s]  Look at how much acceleration.
[9262.18s -> 9264.18s]  That guy went 5,000 miles.
[9264.18s -> 9264.74s]  Look at him.
[9264.74s -> 9265.94s]  I'm holding R.
[9265.94s -> 9267.14s]  I'm holding down right trigger.
[9267.86s -> 9268.74s]  That guy has...
[9268.74s -> 9270.42s]  He's going 10 times faster than me.
[9281.04s -> 9281.84s]  Ride the bank.
[9293.28s -> 9294.72s]  You tried going as fast as you can.
[9294.72s -> 9298.24s]  Yeah, your car spins around in a circle and every other AI driver
[9298.24s -> 9300.08s]  drives 500 miles per hour.
[9300.56s -> 9307.76s]  I'm the only one that has to drive the car.
[9308.48s -> 9324.24s]  Okay, at least one idiot I get to pass.
[9324.96s -> 9329.60s]  Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[9329.60s -> 9331.04s]  We got a full idiot pile up here.
[9349.03s -> 9350.63s]  Easy, don't rip the wheel.
[9350.63s -> 9358.79s]  Look, there he goes.
[9375.49s -> 9377.01s]  Ride the wall.
[9377.01s -> 9399.24s]  I don't care.
[9399.80s -> 9403.88s]  I'm not going to sit here for five hours.
[9403.88s -> 9405.08s]  I don't give a shit.
[9405.08s -> 9406.74s]  I don't care.
[9406.74s -> 9407.30s]  I'm just going to beat it.
[9407.30s -> 9408.42s]  I'm just going to play the game.
[9408.42s -> 9410.74s]  What, I have to do the driving mission for four hours?
[9410.74s -> 9417.80s]  If you can beat the Simpsons hit and run.
[9417.80s -> 9420.20s]  Simpsons run at least had a car that made sense when you drove it.
[9420.84s -> 9425.43s]  And I know, oh, it's an old car.
[9426.23s -> 9427.24s]  Yeah, whatever.
[9427.96s -> 9431.56s]  I'm going to blow by these fucking assholes on easy.
[9432.36s -> 9437.22s]  This is grandma difficulty.
[9437.86s -> 9458.82s]  Get out of the way.
[9472.15s -> 9474.07s]  I don't care.
[9474.07s -> 9474.79s]  I don't care.
[9474.79s -> 9476.15s]  You can call me terrible.
[9476.15s -> 9477.83s]  You can call me shitty all you want.
[9478.55s -> 9481.19s]  I'm going to get in first place on easy.
[9481.19s -> 9482.87s]  Hand the controller to your mother game.
[9484.87s -> 9486.07s]  Even this is still hard.
[9487.27s -> 9487.99s]  Oh shit.
[9489.03s -> 9490.98s]  I can't lose on easy.
[9490.98s -> 9491.94s]  I got to first try it on easy.
[9491.94s -> 9493.38s]  Otherwise, I have to delete my Twitch account.
[9508.29s -> 9508.85s]  Get off me.
[9508.85s -> 9530.42s]  Get off of me.
[9530.42s -> 9531.46s]  Bank, bank, bank, bank.
[9531.46s -> 9532.58s]  I don't need to bank anything.
[9532.58s -> 9534.74s]  This is to win.
[9543.33s -> 9544.55s]  I know, I'm trying to kill that guy.
[9545.67s -> 9546.15s]  That's a threat.
[9546.15s -> 9547.11s]  That's the guy in second place.
[9547.83s -> 9557.40s]  I don't care.
[9557.40s -> 9558.20s]  I don't care.
[9558.20s -> 9561.40s]  I know people are going to be making fun of me for years over this.
[9561.40s -> 9561.80s]  Who cares?
[9570.26s -> 9570.90s]  Use the bank.
[9571.46s -> 9572.82s]  Guys, I don't even know what that means.
[9573.78s -> 9575.06s]  When I hear you say that, all I know to think about
[9575.06s -> 9576.34s]  is like withdrawing money from an ATM.
[9576.34s -> 9576.98s]  I don't know.
[9576.98s -> 9577.70s]  Use the bank.
[9577.70s -> 9578.90s]  I don't even know what that means.
[9578.90s -> 9579.30s]  I'm going to win.
[9579.30s -> 9579.86s]  I'm in first place.
[9579.86s -> 9580.50s]  I'm doing fine.
[9581.30s -> 9599.17s]  I don't tip over.
[9599.17s -> 9599.65s]  Okay, I'm fine.
[9604.82s -> 9606.58s]  I'm embarrassed for him.
[9606.58s -> 9607.46s]  No, you're not.
[9607.46s -> 9607.94s]  It's fine.
[9607.94s -> 9608.42s]  Whatever.
[9608.42s -> 9608.74s]  What do you...
[9608.74s -> 9609.46s]  What does it matter?
[9612.48s -> 9612.64s]  What?
[9612.64s -> 9613.04s]  Everyone...
[9613.04s -> 9614.16s]  You know, your resident sleep...
[9614.16s -> 9615.44s]  Fine, I'll put it on classic mode again.
[9616.24s -> 9617.12s]  I can't lose my Twitch account.
[9617.12s -> 9618.32s]  It's going to get fucking deleted if I don't win.
[9621.27s -> 9632.98s]  I set for a bank.
[9643.17s -> 9647.65s]  Come on, this guy's smoking.
[9653.27s -> 9653.91s]  Okay, I'm good.
[9653.91s -> 9654.47s]  I'm good.
[9654.47s -> 9655.03s]  I'm good.
[9655.03s -> 9655.27s]  I'm good.
[9655.27s -> 9655.51s]  I'm good.
[9655.51s -> 9667.33s]  I'm good.
[9667.33s -> 9668.85s]  How embarrassing.
[9668.85s -> 9670.61s]  Get those resident sleepers out of here.
[9670.61s -> 9672.21s]  Get those resident sleepers out of here.
[9672.21s -> 9673.25s]  I don't want to see them.
[9678.34s -> 9679.62s]  Get the resident sleepers out of here.
[9680.18s -> 9681.56s]  Fine.
[9681.56s -> 9682.60s]  You want me to turn it on classic?
[9683.24s -> 9685.17s]  Where's the end of the match?
[9685.89s -> 9690.20s]  All right, fine.
[9690.20s -> 9691.40s]  Let me just get to this next turn
[9691.40s -> 9692.44s]  and I'll put it on classic mode.
[9693.00s -> 9695.92s]  Where's the finish...
[9695.92s -> 9696.56s]  Where's the finish line?
[9697.20s -> 9717.92s]  Do it now.
[9717.92s -> 9718.80s]  Not yet.
[9718.80s -> 9720.79s]  After I ride the bank, I will...
[9721.59s -> 9722.95s]  This is all the sleepers.
[9724.07s -> 9724.71s]  Fuck, man.
[9727.51s -> 9728.23s]  What the fuck?
[9728.23s -> 9728.63s]  Come on.
[9728.63s -> 9729.59s]  I don't want to...
[9729.59s -> 9730.23s]  That's all right.
[9733.28s -> 9734.64s]  Look, I'll beat it on classic.
[9734.64s -> 9735.36s]  How does that sound?
[9748.40s -> 9749.44s]  All right, we did it.
[9756.71s -> 9757.91s]  I'm getting booed, but I won.
[9758.47s -> 9759.51s]  I'll take the booze.
[9774.02s -> 9775.38s]  Think you underestimate
[9775.38s -> 9776.82s]  how much patience I have for that.
[9780.82s -> 9782.02s]  Relapse on classic mode?
[9782.02s -> 9782.66s]  No fucking way.
[9783.94s -> 9784.74s]  Stream would turn off.
[9799.20s -> 9799.52s]  Oh shit.
[9799.52s -> 9801.44s]  This is the most spam
[9801.44s -> 9802.64s]  I've ever seen on my channel.
[9804.00s -> 9804.72s]  Holy shit.
[9804.72s -> 9806.72s]  It's every single person doing this.
[9806.72s -> 9807.84s]  Every single one of you is doing this.
[9808.48s -> 9809.12s]  Holy shit.
[9810.96s -> 9812.45s]  I must mean it's true.
[9828.26s -> 9829.64s]  No, no, no.
[9830.04s -> 9831.72s]  Take off emote only mode,
[9831.72s -> 9833.00s]  and I want everyone to spam that.
[9833.00s -> 9834.36s]  I want you to break my chat.
[9836.80s -> 9838.48s]  There was 10,000 people there.
[9838.48s -> 9839.12s]  I deserve it.
[9854.24s -> 9855.36s]  Hey, remember when we said that?
[9856.64s -> 9857.28s]  What it would look like
[9857.28s -> 9858.64s]  if you had bots in your channel?
[9860.34s -> 9861.62s]  This is it right here.
[9868.10s -> 9869.22s]  Now I can just play the game.
[9869.22s -> 9870.74s]  Well, I just want to play the game.
[9871.38s -> 9874.84s]  I just want to experience the story.
[9880.28s -> 9881.08s]  Whoa, did you say
[9881.08s -> 9882.36s]  you just put it on easy, Tommy?
[9882.92s -> 9885.96s]  I wasn't paying that much attention.
[9902.58s -> 9903.14s]  No more.
[9903.14s -> 9904.02s]  I'm done.
[9904.02s -> 9904.98s]  I don't want to see it anymore.
[9904.98s -> 9905.46s]  No more.
[9908.15s -> 9908.47s]  Okay.
[9908.47s -> 9908.95s]  No more.
[9909.91s -> 9913.11s]  Put it into cool guy mode.
[9913.11s -> 9913.51s]  Put it in.
[9913.51s -> 9913.99s]  All right.
[9913.99s -> 9914.63s]  No more of that.
[9915.89s -> 9917.17s]  Making me feel self-conscious.
[9917.81s -> 9919.26s]  Yeah.
[9922.20s -> 9923.88s]  I'm feeling a little self-conscious right now.
[9924.44s -> 9926.56s]  Where's Polly?
[9926.56s -> 9937.44s]  Here's the funny part.
[9937.44s -> 9938.48s]  The people that come into the stream
[9938.48s -> 9940.08s]  that see that I've only been streaming for a few hours
[9940.08s -> 9940.48s]  are going to be like,
[9940.48s -> 9942.80s]  holy shit, he beat that mission in like an hour or so.
[9942.80s -> 9943.28s]  Pretty good.
[9943.28s -> 9943.68s]  Top tier.
[9948.66s -> 9949.16s]  What?
[9952.32s -> 9952.82s]  Polly.
[9953.76s -> 9954.80s]  Looking for Polly.
[9958.04s -> 9959.40s]  Yeah, I'm realizing right now
[9959.40s -> 9961.40s]  I just did the unforgivable sin.
[9963.80s -> 9964.84s]  I made it.
[9964.84s -> 9966.36s]  I put the game on easy.
[9967.81s -> 9968.85s]  On stream.
[9968.85s -> 9969.97s]  On Twitch.
[9969.97s -> 9972.37s]  That was very bad.
[9972.37s -> 9973.41s]  I never should have done that.
[9974.72s -> 9975.22s]  Yep.
[9975.60s -> 9980.72s]  Polly, where the fuck are you?
[9981.36s -> 9987.22s]  I could have put it on normal
[9987.86s -> 9989.22s]  and got away with it probably
[9989.22s -> 9991.46s]  with enough explaining and enough gas lighting.
[9992.26s -> 9992.82s]  Easy though.
[9993.62s -> 9994.12s]  No.
[9994.84s -> 9995.72s]  It's going to be about a year
[9995.72s -> 9997.16s]  before you guys get over that one.
[10000.85s -> 10001.35s]  Polly.
[10004.29s -> 10004.79s]  Polly.
[10005.25s -> 10009.52s]  I don't know what Polly looks like.
[10009.52s -> 10016.39s]  I felt like I was holding a microwave.
[10029.48s -> 10030.12s]  All right.
[10030.12s -> 10030.44s]  All right.
[10030.44s -> 10030.76s]  All right.
[10030.76s -> 10033.00s]  Let's continue our playthrough of Mafia.
[10036.56s -> 10037.20s]  There's Polly.
[10037.20s -> 10037.70s]  Hey, Polly.
[10043.36s -> 10043.86s]  Eat.
[10044.16s -> 10045.44s]  Okay, he's going to eat.
[10045.44s -> 10046.64s]  There's the cafeteria over here.
[10047.20s -> 10064.77s]  Probably right here.
[10064.77s -> 10065.27s]  Polly?
[10066.16s -> 10066.96s]  Eating?
[10066.96s -> 10067.46s]  Somewhere?
[10071.25s -> 10073.17s]  I think I might put it on easy to find him.
[10073.81s -> 10075.78s]  Yeah, he'll probably show me
[10075.78s -> 10077.30s]  an indicator on the map where he is.
[10077.30s -> 10077.94s]  Not a bad idea.
[10086.28s -> 10086.78s]  Polly?
[10086.78s -> 10087.56s]  Where the hell is he?
[10088.12s -> 10090.07s]  There he is.
[10091.59s -> 10092.09s]  Polly.
[10094.60s -> 10095.56s]  God damn it, man.
[10096.44s -> 10098.80s]  Why aren't you Polly?
[10098.80s -> 10099.68s]  For the love of God.
[10100.40s -> 10103.19s]  It's as if he was eating.
[10103.75s -> 10108.45s]  He's the guy that looks like Jimmy Fallon.
[10110.92s -> 10112.52s]  They all look like Jimmy Fallon.
[10125.08s -> 10126.68s]  It's just Jimmy Fallon everywhere.
[10145.03s -> 10145.53s]  Polly?
[10152.23s -> 10155.92s]  You look like Jimmy Fallon.
[10155.92s -> 10157.28s]  Everybody looks like Jimmy Fallon.
[10163.01s -> 10163.49s]  Oh, of course.
[10163.49s -> 10165.57s]  He's the guy all the way at the edge of the map lying down.
[10180.39s -> 10181.67s]  This is show some respect.
[10181.67s -> 10182.71s]  Jimmy Fallon?
[10182.71s -> 10183.35s]  That's true.
[10183.35s -> 10185.51s]  But I'm saying you gotta go home too.
[10185.51s -> 10187.19s]  He does look like Jimmy Fallon.
[10189.12s -> 10189.84s]  Okay then.
[10190.56s -> 10191.30s]  I guess.
[10194.31s -> 10196.56s]  Let's go, Jim.
[10197.68s -> 10203.88s]  He's about as funny as Jimmy Fallon.
[10209.83s -> 10211.19s]  You know, I haven't seen Jimmy Fallon
[10212.24s -> 10214.72s]  do anything in, I don't know,
[10214.72s -> 10215.92s]  probably seven or eight years.
[10225.25s -> 10227.41s]  He says he hosts the Tonight Show or something, right?
[10232.44s -> 10233.72s]  You know what I said?
[10233.72s -> 10236.16s]  What did you say, Polly?
[10236.16s -> 10238.36s]  I said this guy.
[10238.36s -> 10239.00s]  Oh, no, no, no.
[10239.00s -> 10239.48s]  That's not true.
[10240.12s -> 10242.28s]  I ate his Ben and Jerry's ice cream.
[10243.80s -> 10245.48s]  Yeah, that was like probably a year ago.
[10245.48s -> 10247.96s]  So I have consumed Jimmy Fallon content.
[10252.53s -> 10253.33s]  By the way, it sucks.
[10254.05s -> 10256.08s]  It's really not that good.
[10260.98s -> 10264.93s]  Half-baked best Ben and Jerry's ice cream.
[10264.93s -> 10266.29s]  You don't even need a celebrity on that one.
[10270.18s -> 10271.46s]  Or Chunky Monkey.
[10271.46s -> 10271.94s]  Get out of here.
[10271.94s -> 10272.44s]  What do you mean?
[10280.12s -> 10281.16s]  I love Chunky Monkey.
[10281.16s -> 10281.66s]  He's the best.
[10285.41s -> 10287.01s]  Chunky Monkey without the walnuts
[10287.01s -> 10288.29s]  would be the best ice cream ever made.
[10299.20s -> 10300.56s]  I don't like nuts and ice cream, really.
[10301.52s -> 10302.88s]  I love pistachio ice cream,
[10302.88s -> 10305.60s]  but I don't like the pistachios in the ice cream.
[10305.60s -> 10308.08s]  I just like the pistachio-flavored green ice cream.
[10309.44s -> 10311.24s]  Kind of getting in the way.
[10311.24s -> 10312.60s]  I usually just go around them.
[10319.38s -> 10320.02s]  What happened?
[10322.42s -> 10324.98s]  What am I doing?
[10342.74s -> 10343.22s]  Fish food.
[10343.22s -> 10344.10s]  Yeah, fish food's pretty good.
[10344.82s -> 10347.22s]  Take me to the blue tropics.
[10347.22s -> 10349.94s]  I didn't take you home.
[10349.94s -> 10350.76s]  The bridge.
[10351.72s -> 10353.72s]  Take the bridge over to the island.
[10354.36s -> 10355.56s]  Take me to the ladies.
[10356.68s -> 10358.28s]  Pauly, get out of the car, please.
[10358.28s -> 10359.40s]  Go lie down for a few hours.
[10375.24s -> 10376.44s]  Way to drive in movie.
[10376.44s -> 10377.80s]  Get the fuck out of the car, Pauly.
[10383.24s -> 10384.52s]  I feel so good.
[10384.52s -> 10389.11s]  After complete.
[10393.92s -> 10395.12s]  We had some subs, by the way.
[10395.12s -> 10398.08s]  We had Nepsi gave five community subs.
[10398.08s -> 10401.62s]  Chungy, Chungy Scrungey gave five,
[10402.26s -> 10404.34s]  and then Malcolm X2 gave five as well.
[10404.34s -> 10405.46s]  Let's go, Tom.
[10405.46s -> 10406.26s]  You want anything else?
[10406.26s -> 10411.16s]  No, I'm heading home.
[10411.16s -> 10413.56s]  Hey, Tom, before you go,
[10414.20s -> 10416.55s]  I ask you maybe a small favor.
[10417.35s -> 10418.29s]  Sure, Luigi.
[10418.29s -> 10418.93s]  What do you need?
[10418.93s -> 10420.37s]  Zombie Eater, $50.
[10420.37s -> 10421.65s]  5,000 fucking bits.
[10422.45s -> 10423.01s]  Sarah.
[10423.01s -> 10424.05s]  Thank you, Zombie Eater.
[10424.05s -> 10424.53s]  Yeah, I hear it.
[10424.53s -> 10425.49s]  She doesn't need any kind of-
[10425.49s -> 10426.13s]  Huge money.
[10428.48s -> 10429.68s]  You owe us a chubby bunny,
[10429.68s -> 10430.96s]  but seeing as that you committed the card,
[10430.96s -> 10433.92s]  I'll set up changing the game's difficulty to easy on stream.
[10434.64s -> 10435.84s]  Don't you think we deserve something else?
[10441.04s -> 10441.76s]  Maybe.
[10441.76s -> 10442.48s]  I'll think about that.
[10450.34s -> 10450.98s]  I gotta piss.
[10451.78s -> 10453.06s]  Watch the cut scene and relax.
[10453.06s -> 10453.78s]  I'll be right back.
[10459.12s -> 10461.28s]  Luigi, I'd be honored.
[10465.67s -> 10467.43s]  Sarah, time to close.
[10475.80s -> 10476.84s]  What's this then?
[10479.46s -> 10480.42s]  Tom is...
[10480.42s -> 10481.30s]  Tom's gonna take you.
[10482.96s -> 10483.44s]  They're right.
[10484.32s -> 10485.92s]  Hey, I just work here.
[10486.64s -> 10487.84s]  Make sure nobody bother you.
[10490.28s -> 10491.08s]  Fine.
[10491.08s -> 10492.52s]  If it'll make you feel better, Pop.
[10493.16s -> 10493.40s]  Hey.
[10494.12s -> 10496.20s]  I'll see you tomorrow.
[10496.84s -> 10500.87s]  Let me get my coat.
[10500.87s -> 10501.99s]  I'll wait for you outside.
[10502.63s -> 10511.24s]  You okay?
[10511.88s -> 10513.56s]  I don't need anyone walking me home.
[10514.37s -> 10516.61s]  Hey, we were talking about meeting up tonight anyway.
[10517.57s -> 10521.57s]  Quit goofing off.
[10521.57s -> 10532.55s]  Okay.
[10532.55s -> 10533.59s]  I'll wait for you, I guess.
[10544.26s -> 10545.30s]  You with me or not?
[10554.71s -> 10555.35s]  AFK.
[10557.68s -> 10559.20s]  Hey, welcome to stream AFK.
[10560.88s -> 10561.20s]  Ow.
[10562.15s -> 10562.95s]  Oh, cookies.
[10563.67s -> 10564.31s]  Hey, guys.
[10564.31s -> 10565.27s]  What is it?
[10565.27s -> 10567.33s]  What is he gonna think?
[10567.33s -> 10571.52s]  He treats me like a kid sometimes.
[10571.52s -> 10572.93s]  Hey, I get it.
[10572.93s -> 10574.21s]  He's protective.
[10574.21s -> 10575.01s]  He's seen things.
[10575.65s -> 10577.73s]  We've all seen things.
[10577.73s -> 10579.33s]  What am I holding?
[10579.97s -> 10582.56s]  We gotta talk about you stealing food.
[10583.36s -> 10586.16s]  Hey, I cook it, so I get to say where it goes.
[10586.80s -> 10587.73s]  We won't say.
[10587.73s -> 10588.13s]  Wait, is it-
[10588.13s -> 10589.09s]  Are we gonna go on a date or something?
[10589.09s -> 10591.73s]  Well, maybe tomorrow's finally gonna be the day he fixes his own food.
[10591.73s -> 10609.14s]  He's hoping it.
[10609.14s -> 10615.11s]  All right, now let's run.
[10615.11s -> 10623.12s]  Hello?
[10623.12s -> 10625.46s]  Yeah, oh, it's not as much as last time.
[10626.18s -> 10627.30s]  It's enough.
[10627.30s -> 10629.32s]  No one thinks you're an angel.
[10629.32s -> 10631.40s]  The dawn hates being food go to waste.
[10632.36s -> 10635.08s]  And this, this has gotta be Tommy.
[10635.64s -> 10636.44s]  This is Tommy.
[10636.44s -> 10638.42s]  They told us all about you.
[10638.42s -> 10639.06s]  Isn't that right?
[10639.78s -> 10641.94s]  Your famous race driver, Tom.
[10641.94s -> 10643.14s]  Everyone talks about you.
[10644.02s -> 10645.06s]  Yeah, she's right.
[10645.78s -> 10649.32s]  They talk about anything in particular besides that I just won the race?
[10649.32s -> 10650.76s]  Nothing about how hard it was?
[10652.68s -> 10653.56s]  No, not yet.
[10653.56s -> 10654.20s]  Not that I've heard.
[10654.20s -> 10654.84s]  I'll see you at church.
[10654.84s -> 10655.34s]  Good.
[10666.87s -> 10667.51s]  All right, Sarah.
[10668.53s -> 10669.57s]  We had a wonderful date.
[10670.13s -> 10671.65s]  It's been really fun.
[10671.65s -> 10674.10s]  It's nice you do that, Tom.
[10674.10s -> 10682.92s]  Well, three people on this block.
[10684.00s -> 10686.32s]  Trump voice is the lowest form of comedy that you have.
[10686.32s -> 10686.82s]  What?
[10689.03s -> 10689.43s]  Who's-
[10689.43s -> 10690.39s]  One of the-
[10690.39s -> 10691.11s]  Donald Trump?
[10691.11s -> 10691.67s]  What are you talking about?
[10691.67s -> 10692.31s]  I was-
[10692.31s -> 10693.27s]  This is this guy.
[10693.27s -> 10693.99s]  What are you talking about?
[10693.99s -> 10694.71s]  That's all you got?
[10694.71s -> 10697.65s]  You spend all the time with a lady killer like Sam Trepine.
[10697.65s -> 10700.05s]  Just because you go like this doesn't mean it's Donald.
[10700.05s -> 10701.57s]  I have it automatically, Donald.
[10701.57s -> 10703.09s]  I was doing his voice.
[10703.09s -> 10713.06s]  I wasn't doing Trump.
[10713.06s -> 10713.56s]  No.
[10716.29s -> 10716.79s]  No.
[10732.47s -> 10733.67s]  Is there gonna be a fight or something here?
[10733.67s -> 10740.68s]  No.
[10740.68s -> 10742.18s]  I mentioned it to dad this one time.
[10742.18s -> 10744.82s]  And all of a sudden he gets you to be my knight in shining armor.
[10744.82s -> 10746.26s]  No, no, Sarah.
[10746.26s -> 10746.58s]  Don't worry.
[10746.58s -> 10747.30s]  These are all actors.
[10748.40s -> 10749.04s]  All of them.
[10749.04s -> 10749.84s]  Well, like I said-
[10749.84s -> 10750.88s]  Every single fucking one.
[10750.88s -> 10751.68s]  Please, there's no problem.
[10751.68s -> 10757.86s]  He said you wouldn't want other guys I dated.
[10757.86s -> 10765.27s]  I'm trying to save Tommy and all.
[10765.27s -> 10766.87s]  These guys over here playing dice,
[10766.87s -> 10770.07s]  they're gonna do the exact same movements over and over again.
[10770.07s -> 10771.65s]  Pictures made.
[10771.65s -> 10773.01s]  They gotta make sure they stay in the camera.
[10773.01s -> 10774.37s]  They did blocking earlier.
[10774.37s -> 10775.99s]  Check that out.
[10775.99s -> 10782.07s]  Sarah, this camera's in every fucking direction.
[10782.07s -> 10789.24s]  Are you stepping-
[10789.24s -> 10791.04s]  Piss off.
[10791.04s -> 10796.16s]  We'll let your boyfriend watch.
[10796.16s -> 10797.20s]  What do you say?
[10797.20s -> 10798.80s]  We going to have trouble here.
[10798.80s -> 10801.68s]  Trouble started back when you tried to steal our girl, chief.
[10802.56s -> 10804.32s]  You saps aren't careful.
[10805.04s -> 10806.56s]  You'll end up in wooden overcoats.
[10809.35s -> 10810.63s]  Last chance to walk away.
[10811.35s -> 10812.31s]  We ain't for ales.
[10813.19s -> 10814.47s]  We know who you work for.
[10815.97s -> 10819.01s]  Sally Erie might have been the big six when he was younger,
[10819.01s -> 10821.25s]  but he's all washed up now.
[10821.25s -> 10822.13s]  It's only a matter of time-
[10822.13s -> 10822.85s]  Zoomer hair.
[10824.13s -> 10826.13s]  I need Sally Erie.
[10826.93s -> 10827.81s]  Or anyone else.
[10828.98s -> 10829.62s]  Not for this.
[10832.56s -> 10835.54s]  See what you got, cake eater.
[10835.54s -> 10836.74s]  All right, so I just kicked their asses.
[10836.74s -> 10837.86s]  This is where we let off to.
[10839.35s -> 10841.43s]  Uh, I just pulled a grenade.
[10852.53s -> 10853.03s]  Weapon.
[10859.52s -> 10860.40s]  You still want to fight me?
[10869.89s -> 10871.17s]  Okay, at what point would you run?
[10871.17s -> 10871.97s]  Okay, I run now.
[10876.12s -> 10877.08s]  Oh, no.
[10877.08s -> 10878.68s]  He changed the difficulty to easy.
[10879.40s -> 10881.12s]  This is supposed to be a fist fight.
[10881.76s -> 10883.06s]  Let's get out of here.
[10897.28s -> 10897.78s]  Ooh.
[10898.56s -> 10901.72s]  Okay, am I gonna get in trouble for that?
[10902.28s -> 10908.88s]  Push me?
[10912.84s -> 10913.80s]  Stab him.
[10913.80s -> 10924.29s]  Holy shit.
[10928.52s -> 10929.32s]  Oh, boss.
[10932.50s -> 10947.41s]  Fuck it.
[10947.41s -> 10947.91s]  Ooh.
[10959.62s -> 10960.58s]  Oh, my God.
[10960.58s -> 10962.82s]  This guy would be out in a second, dude.
[10972.85s -> 10973.73s]  God damn it, man.
[10973.73s -> 10974.77s]  How many running hits do I-
[10974.77s -> 10977.14s]  That's what I got, you little bitch.
[10977.14s -> 10983.54s]  Do I kill him?
[10983.54s -> 10986.07s]  All right, get to Sarah.
[10986.07s -> 10986.55s]  Give me the bat.
[10987.11s -> 10998.53s]  All right, they're all actors.
[10998.53s -> 10999.49s]  You got a good right hook.
[10999.49s -> 11000.13s]  I'll give you that.
[11002.44s -> 11003.08s]  You're bleeding.
[11004.31s -> 11005.51s]  Come up to my place.
[11005.51s -> 11006.31s]  I'll take a look.
[11007.86s -> 11008.50s]  Am I, though?
[11008.98s -> 11011.04s]  Is I supposed to be bleeding?
[11021.06s -> 11025.75s]  Yeah, their blood is all over my arms.
[11045.75s -> 11046.25s]  Where?
[11048.63s -> 11049.11s]  Oh, on my-
[11049.11s -> 11050.23s]  It's supposed to be on the arm.
[11059.78s -> 11060.42s]  What do you got?
[11063.70s -> 11064.82s]  Compliments of the done.
[11074.74s -> 11075.24s]  Nice.
[11075.78s -> 11076.85s]  Take another.
[11077.81s -> 11081.94s]  I mean, I get-
[11081.94s -> 11083.14s]  All right.
[11083.14s -> 11084.18s]  You gonna grin and bear this?
[11084.18s -> 11085.78s]  Is this like the 1600s?
[11085.78s -> 11087.22s]  Yeah, I'll be okay.
[11087.22s -> 11087.72s]  Good.
[11089.27s -> 11093.11s]  You were like doctors and you didn't just like drink alcohol to do-
[11093.11s -> 11094.23s]  take care of wounds and shit.
[11094.23s -> 11095.59s]  Think about it, will ya?
[11095.59s -> 11097.19s]  It's gonna take as long as it takes.
[11098.15s -> 11101.27s]  The sloppier the stitch, the uglier the scar.
[11101.27s -> 11101.83s]  Yes, you did.
[11101.83s -> 11102.33s]  Am I right?
[11103.11s -> 11105.81s]  You stitched up a lot of fellas.
[11105.81s -> 11106.93s]  Getting rid of scurvy.
[11137.89s -> 11138.69s]  It's just duct tape.
[11145.91s -> 11160.76s]  Yeah, you're in a full suit.
[11161.32s -> 11161.80s]  You wanna-
[11161.80s -> 11162.44s]  No, no, no.
[11162.44s -> 11163.64s]  This thing never comes off, ever.
[11165.41s -> 11166.61s]  I shower in this fucking thing.
[11180.87s -> 11181.37s]  Sarah.
[11184.39s -> 11186.39s]  Hey, Mayo, thanks for the five community subs.
[11186.39s -> 11189.11s]  And also Rip, Alex Trebek, thanks for the five community subs, too.
[11189.11s -> 11192.28s]  He has a drop in subs today.
[11194.26s -> 11194.76s]  Thank you.
[11203.24s -> 11205.64s]  She started working here before she could see over the bar.
[11206.52s -> 11208.95s]  I don't have a daughter of my own, Tom.
[11208.95s -> 11211.64s]  I'd do anything for Luigi's little girl.
[11212.76s -> 11213.32s]  So would I.
[11215.68s -> 11216.32s]  We all would.
[11216.96s -> 11218.13s]  That's right, boss.
[11218.85s -> 11220.21s]  Anything for Luigi and Sarah.
[11220.21s -> 11222.69s]  Do those bastards think this is fucking Luna Parker?
[11222.69s -> 11223.81s]  I'd just say Jimmy Fallon.
[11223.81s -> 11224.31s]  That's all I-
[11224.31s -> 11226.05s]  I'll rip him apart with my own hands.
[11226.05s -> 11229.57s]  Just, I'm waiting for him to start laughing and look into the camera and giggle and shit.
[11229.57s -> 11232.85s]  But who's gonna pay up when they learn we can't even protect one of our own
[11232.85s -> 11234.05s]  as she walks home from work?
[11234.85s -> 11235.97s]  So what do you want us to do?
[11237.09s -> 11238.05s]  Teach these boys-
[11238.05s -> 11240.21s]  Yeah, I would do anything for Sarah.
[11240.21s -> 11241.17s]  I would do anything for Sarah.
[11241.17s -> 11242.21s]  Put them in their bodies.
[11242.21s -> 11243.33s]  Put them in wheelchairs.
[11243.33s -> 11248.05s]  Bust their faces up so bad even their mothers can't look at them without screaming.
[11248.05s -> 11249.80s]  We know where they're holed up.
[11249.80s -> 11253.64s]  My friend on the floor says we should start looking in the Chinatown.
[11253.64s -> 11255.16s]  Then Big Biff will know something.
[11255.88s -> 11259.08s]  Tommy, go to Vinnie, get us some gear.
[11259.08s -> 11260.28s]  Meet me at Biff's place.
[11260.28s -> 11260.84s]  Yeah, okay.
[11261.64s -> 11263.40s]  Leave these punks laying in the street.
[11264.12s -> 11265.48s]  I want everyone to know.
[11266.04s -> 11270.12s]  We do not allow mad dogs to run wild in our neighborhood.
[11270.12s -> 11271.00s]  You got it, boss.
[11272.12s -> 11278.69s]  Some of these sons of bitches could still be on our turf.
[11278.69s -> 11278.93s]  Go.
[11278.93s -> 11280.05s]  I'll check the neighborhood.
[11280.69s -> 11282.77s]  Make sure they're gone while you see Biff.
[11282.77s -> 11283.25s]  Good, huh?
[11283.25s -> 11285.33s]  I'm gonna take a selfie with an anime character filter.
[11285.33s -> 11287.01s]  Okay, so when you're done with Vinnie, come find me-
[11287.01s -> 11289.65s]  Uh, I don't know what that means.
[11290.61s -> 11291.73s]  Like a Snapchat thing?
[11291.73s -> 11292.69s]  I don't have Snapchat.
[11293.57s -> 11297.52s]  All right, talk to Vincenzo.
[11298.08s -> 11302.79s]  Like, get in the car, talk to Vincenzo.
[11303.35s -> 11306.21s]  All right, talk to Vincenzo.
[11306.21s -> 11310.68s]  You got a new weapon for me?
[11310.68s -> 11312.76s]  I can- give me like a grenade or something.
[11312.76s -> 11318.44s]  Hey, hey, here for some heaters, Tom.
[11319.00s -> 11321.40s]  Nah, I'm already going and healed.
[11321.40s -> 11322.90s]  All in me.
[11322.90s -> 11325.38s]  We gotta give a beating to some punks who've been on our turf.
[11326.10s -> 11329.28s]  I don't want to pull this and piss in our own street.
[11330.08s -> 11331.62s]  There's something to bust heads.
[11331.62s -> 11332.42s]  That's all we need.
[11333.06s -> 11336.87s]  Why is this guy the-
[11336.87s -> 11339.19s]  Sam turned over some guys' ware house.
[11339.19s -> 11341.35s]  1930s Q from James Bond.
[11341.35s -> 11343.51s]  Gotta grab that babe roof himself, the guy said.
[11344.07s -> 11346.55s]  I mean, that's horse shit, but they bust heads.
[11346.63s -> 11347.67s]  It's just baseball bats.
[11350.90s -> 11351.86s]  This is not something-
[11351.86s -> 11353.70s]  Oh, yeah, what an elaborate thing.
[11353.70s -> 11355.54s]  You could just go buy these at Walmart.
[11355.54s -> 11356.90s]  Why do we need a guy for this?
[11357.62s -> 11359.30s]  Just go get some baseball bats.
[11359.30s -> 11362.90s]  Anywhere in the fucking whole world.
[11362.90s -> 11364.74s]  We really need a guy for that?
[11380.74s -> 11383.22s]  1930s mafia James Bond.
[11383.86s -> 11385.48s]  Hey, here's a bat.
[11386.36s -> 11387.80s]  Oh, cool, this is a normal bat.
[11387.80s -> 11389.72s]  Does the top open and a little gun comes out,
[11389.72s -> 11391.64s]  just a little knife that shoots out and stabs somebody with a dart?
[11392.36s -> 11396.04s]  Nah, you just hit him in the fucking skull and they die.
[11397.33s -> 11409.11s]  Oh, okay, it's corked.
[11415.89s -> 11417.17s]  I can't drive past this.
[11417.89s -> 11419.76s]  I like the rain, though.
[11419.76s -> 11420.24s]  Nice touch.
[11428.45s -> 11429.65s]  Why even shape them into bats?
[11429.65s -> 11431.73s]  Just buy wood and give-
[11432.37s -> 11435.49s]  Just go to like Home Depot and buy a bunch of 2x4s,
[11435.49s -> 11437.57s]  cut them in half and use those instead.
[11437.57s -> 11438.21s]  It's probably cheaper.
[11438.93s -> 11446.48s]  Why does it have to be a bat?
[11446.48s -> 11448.15s]  It does the same thing.
[11448.15s -> 11451.86s]  It's a piece of wood that's heavy you hit somebody with.
[11455.09s -> 11455.33s]  Break?
[11455.33s -> 11456.45s]  Well, bat would break, too, wouldn't it?
[11462.42s -> 11463.70s]  All right, Polly, what are we doing?
[11492.04s -> 11492.68s]  I want to get my bat.
[11492.68s -> 11494.28s]  Follow Polly to Biff's pawn shop.
[11496.08s -> 11497.12s]  I gotta keep following Polly.
[11515.35s -> 11516.07s]  There's a bear in here.
[11527.99s -> 11528.71s]  Name Billy.
[11529.59s -> 11532.47s]  Pals with a prissy chump and a boozer with a bald head.
[11532.47s -> 11534.47s]  Right, right, I know them.
[11534.47s -> 11537.35s]  They're set up in the old service station in a block over.
[11538.07s -> 11539.19s]  They hock some gear every-
[11539.19s -> 11540.39s]  I want to- I would like to walk.
[11540.39s -> 11541.59s]  ...small time.
[11541.59s -> 11544.08s]  Here to come to you, Biff.
[11544.08s -> 11545.52s]  You're good with small time.
[11545.52s -> 11547.36s]  Out the bed, cross the street.
[11547.36s -> 11548.64s]  You'll find them there.
[11548.64s -> 11549.04s]  Thanks.
[11549.76s -> 11550.88s]  See you around.
[11550.88s -> 11553.67s]  Hey, Polly, about that dough?
[11553.67s -> 11556.55s]  Axe is waiting for my guy to come through.
[11556.55s -> 11556.87s]  Okay.
[11556.87s -> 11558.31s]  Next week, just sit tight.
[11559.27s -> 11561.81s]  I feel like I'm having deja vu.
[11561.81s -> 11563.30s]  I really am.
[11563.30s -> 11566.58s]  This is like mission four in a row, besides the racing one,
[11566.58s -> 11569.14s]  where Q gives you a baseball bat,
[11569.14s -> 11570.74s]  and you've walked into a store with it.
[11579.38s -> 11580.26s]  But I don't even use it.
[11591.44s -> 11593.20s]  Let me go back to the car racing.
[11594.72s -> 11595.68s]  No, I'm not doing that.
[11595.68s -> 11596.24s]  I already beat it.
[11596.24s -> 11598.00s]  It was really hard.
[11598.64s -> 11599.36s]  But I did it, though.
[11602.52s -> 11605.88s]  All we gotta do is find the other guys in Chinatown who look like we do.
[11606.85s -> 11607.41s]  There it is.
[11609.70s -> 11610.26s]  There's what?
[11611.49s -> 11612.05s]  A.S.T.A.T.I.A.N.?
[11616.32s -> 11617.28s]  It's sub one hour?
[11617.28s -> 11618.32s]  Yeah, it's true.
[11622.50s -> 11632.50s]  Can we at least run?
[11633.22s -> 11641.80s]  This game is really fun and it's really cool,
[11641.80s -> 11645.08s]  but they really do like to slow down to L.A. Noire levels
[11645.97s -> 11646.85s]  in some of these missions.
[11647.49s -> 11650.84s]  Kick the door.
[11651.48s -> 11654.13s]  Tell me a nicest A.S.T. I've ever seen in my life.
[11659.17s -> 11669.30s]  Synchronized cigarettes is what I was gonna say.
[11670.02s -> 11681.27s]  It's a Marvel movie?
[11681.83s -> 11688.02s]  This guy's got a bat, too.
[11696.55s -> 11697.51s]  Captain America.
[11698.47s -> 11701.99s]  They are doing the Marvel movie one, two, three sequence.
[11703.17s -> 11704.69s]  Punch, block, punch, punch.
[11705.33s -> 11706.87s]  Block with one arm.
[11706.87s -> 11707.75s]  Punch with left arm.
[11707.75s -> 11708.47s]  Block, punch.
[11710.15s -> 11710.79s]  Into the stomach.
[11710.79s -> 11711.27s]  Into the chest.
[11711.27s -> 11711.75s]  Into the head.
[11712.39s -> 11714.13s]  One at a time.
[11714.13s -> 11724.45s]  Yeah, it always makes this really crazy sound.
[11724.45s -> 11727.80s]  Like this, like, when they punch.
[11728.60s -> 11741.72s]  It's like, oh, wait, I have to run around.
[11741.72s -> 11742.36s]  Let's go this way.
[11752.20s -> 11752.84s]  Jump over it.
[11755.64s -> 11756.04s]  What?
[11756.04s -> 11756.68s]  Oh, shit.
[11758.16s -> 11759.84s]  Oh, that guy's on fire.
[11761.84s -> 11762.88s]  I didn't even do this.
[11762.88s -> 11763.84s]  I feel like I didn't do anything.
[11775.20s -> 11780.61s]  I keep shooting this guy in the ass.
[11780.61s -> 11781.17s]  Is he dead?
[11781.89s -> 11795.17s]  What?
[11795.17s -> 11796.29s]  That was right in the fucking head.
[11797.01s -> 11804.00s]  We're good.
[11804.00s -> 11805.04s]  I have two bullets left.
[11805.04s -> 11811.00s]  Oh, it's not on easy.
[11811.00s -> 11811.96s]  This is on classic mode.
[11818.26s -> 11822.58s]  The health chair.
[11823.22s -> 11830.90s]  Wait, who's who?
[11833.41s -> 11833.89s]  Who's who?
[11835.04s -> 11836.08s]  Was that guy a friend?
[11836.08s -> 11836.56s]  I don't know.
[11837.44s -> 11839.44s]  Is this a bad guy?
[11840.00s -> 11846.40s]  I think we did it.
[11855.25s -> 11855.73s]  Is this hot?
[11855.73s -> 11856.45s]  Can I go in here?
[11869.51s -> 11871.03s]  He's not good either.
[11871.03s -> 11872.07s]  It's okay.
[11872.07s -> 11873.27s]  We both got surprised.
[11877.38s -> 11878.50s]  He's the one that opened the door.
[11878.50s -> 11879.94s]  How is he so surprised to see me?
[11884.04s -> 11884.44s]  Hands up.
[11885.00s -> 11887.89s]  Catch up to Billy.
[11887.89s -> 11888.29s]  Oh, shit.
[11888.29s -> 11888.93s]  Catch up to Billy.
[11889.73s -> 11897.51s]  Fucking whack-a-mole.
[11898.07s -> 11901.44s]  He dropped it.
[11901.44s -> 11902.16s]  Nice throw.
[11902.72s -> 11903.36s]  Nice throw.
[11904.40s -> 11911.19s]  Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out.
[11914.77s -> 11915.65s]  I get him.
[11915.65s -> 11925.64s]  One more guy.
[11925.64s -> 11926.88s]  Where is he?
[11926.88s -> 11929.89s]  Who's shooting?
[11929.89s -> 11932.61s]  You're aiming the gun at me.
[11933.17s -> 11943.20s]  On me.
[11943.20s -> 11943.52s]  Look out.
[11943.52s -> 11943.68s]  What?
[11946.55s -> 11947.27s]  Stupid idea.
[11947.99s -> 11948.71s]  Very stupid.
[11949.60s -> 11951.60s]  Completely out of your element there, man.
[11951.60s -> 11953.04s]  You can run straight at me with a gun.
[11967.86s -> 11969.06s]  Random crit?
[11969.06s -> 11975.17s]  Oh, not this shit.
[11977.88s -> 11979.08s]  Don't let the punks escape.
[11979.08s -> 11979.80s]  Sure, I'll get it.
[11983.06s -> 11984.90s]  I have 21 shots.
[11984.90s -> 11987.14s]  That's not a whole lot of ammo.
[11988.12s -> 11988.92s]  It's raining too.
[11988.92s -> 11989.56s]  I got to be careful.
[11999.57s -> 12000.13s]  Oh, boy.
[12003.12s -> 12005.20s]  Oh, look at...
[12005.20s -> 12017.54s]  Shit.
[12020.72s -> 12022.16s]  Road is so slippery.
[12034.66s -> 12036.50s]  No, I'm going to lose him.
[12037.30s -> 12040.74s]  No, I'm okay.
[12049.89s -> 12064.48s]  We could have just chased him on foot
[12064.48s -> 12065.20s]  and would have been better.
[12065.84s -> 12068.20s]  At least we could have snuck down alleyways.
[12068.84s -> 12076.61s]  How did he pass the racing mission?
[12076.61s -> 12077.81s]  That was pretty tough.
[12077.81s -> 12078.37s]  Took me a while.
[12079.09s -> 12083.44s]  I really zeroed in though on the menu
[12084.16s -> 12088.45s]  when I made it easy on dude.
[12088.45s -> 12089.01s]  Seriously.
[12093.01s -> 12093.57s]  Jesus.
[12100.24s -> 12101.20s]  Oh, it's all right.
[12101.20s -> 12101.84s]  We got Luigi.
[12105.30s -> 12106.90s]  This is a bit...
[12106.90s -> 12107.86s]  They're going to wake up with guns.
[12119.67s -> 12120.31s]  Through the game.
[12135.11s -> 12141.91s]  That car is mangled.
[12142.71s -> 12144.72s]  What did they crash into?
[12150.07s -> 12151.19s]  We weren't going that fast.
[12166.93s -> 12167.57s]  Ah, shit.
[12167.57s -> 12168.29s]  He disconnected.
[12169.17s -> 12171.38s]  I'll wait.
[12171.38s -> 12172.02s]  He might come back.
[12174.26s -> 12176.10s]  Game's fucking multiplayer sucks, Tommy.
[12176.10s -> 12176.66s]  I swear to God.
[12184.15s -> 12195.19s]  Where to get used to it?
[12195.19s -> 12201.17s]  He was in the pause menu setting it to easy.
[12201.73s -> 12202.93s]  That's pretty good.
[12204.47s -> 12205.43s]  That's really good.
[12211.52s -> 12212.40s]  Simple straight.
[12215.17s -> 12215.49s]  Nice.
[12216.05s -> 12216.53s]  Very nice.
[12219.38s -> 12221.62s]  I can't afford this life no more.
[12221.62s -> 12222.50s]  Just getting lucky.
[12223.06s -> 12224.74s]  I'll give you a chance to win your money back.
[12225.62s -> 12226.58s]  You want in, boss?
[12228.47s -> 12230.15s]  We have business to discuss, Paulie.
[12231.03s -> 12232.07s]  We're in it now, boys.
[12232.71s -> 12234.15s]  One of our associates at the court
[12234.15s -> 12235.43s]  in this office sent his over.
[12236.31s -> 12238.71s]  Corpse's name is Joe Ortiz.
[12239.35s -> 12240.61s]  You recognize him?
[12241.25s -> 12241.57s]  Sure.
[12242.13s -> 12243.97s]  That's one of the punks we ran out of the neighborhood.
[12244.69s -> 12246.37s]  Now we got the bullet in the back of his head?
[12246.37s -> 12247.01s]  He did it.
[12247.01s -> 12247.49s]  He did it.
[12247.49s -> 12248.13s]  Jimmy found it.
[12248.85s -> 12250.05s]  Well, the cops ought to thank us.
[12250.05s -> 12251.25s]  We did him a favor.
[12251.25s -> 12252.77s]  The guy was a rapist, boss.
[12252.77s -> 12253.27s]  Yeah?
[12253.73s -> 12255.83s]  Well, he was also a city councilor's son.
[12256.55s -> 12258.87s]  You want to drive a politician into Marella's arms?
[12258.87s -> 12260.79s]  There's no better way than killing off his family.
[12261.83s -> 12262.55s]  That gets worse.
[12263.19s -> 12264.87s]  You left another guy in the wreck?
[12264.87s -> 12268.55s]  In any piece of media, is there ever a senator's son
[12269.35s -> 12271.27s]  that's not a bad guy?
[12271.27s -> 12273.35s]  If you're going to do a job, do it right.
[12273.35s -> 12274.47s]  He made it?
[12274.47s -> 12274.79s]  Yes.
[12275.35s -> 12277.19s]  He spent the week in Santa Mary's, but...
[12277.19s -> 12277.99s]  You killed that guy.
[12277.99s -> 12279.19s]  He was a senator's son.
[12279.19s -> 12280.95s]  Can he point a finger at either of you?
[12280.95s -> 12283.67s]  He was a murderer, rapist, killer, drug addict,
[12284.61s -> 12286.77s]  and he like beat up dogs for fun.
[12287.33s -> 12290.60s]  Look, Senator's son, by the way.
[12291.48s -> 12293.88s]  Galati's funeral's today at St. Michael's.
[12293.88s -> 12295.81s]  Sam, you're going to attend.
[12296.37s -> 12298.71s]  Sit in the back and try to spot the lucky bastard.
[12299.51s -> 12301.19s]  How will I recognize him?
[12301.19s -> 12303.75s]  He'll be the one who just crawled away from a car wreck.
[12304.47s -> 12305.75s]  His arm is broken.
[12305.75s -> 12306.63s]  Look for a sling.
[12307.59s -> 12309.43s]  Sam's going to need a little distraction
[12309.43s -> 12310.79s]  if he's going to clean up your mess.
[12311.51s -> 12313.27s]  He's sending Tommy to dip his wick?
[12314.23s -> 12315.11s]  It's a brothel?
[12315.11s -> 12317.99s]  A gentleman's club, just down the street from St. Michael's.
[12318.63s -> 12321.67s]  Madonna's invested a lot of money in it over the years.
[12321.67s -> 12322.63s]  So are me and Sam.
[12322.63s -> 12327.11s]  Sam, regardless, the owner has suddenly decided
[12327.11s -> 12329.75s]  to do business with Morello instead of us.
[12329.75s -> 12332.23s]  You want me to go remind him of his obligations?
[12332.23s -> 12334.74s]  Yes, then blow the place up.
[12335.70s -> 12336.20s]  What?
[12336.74s -> 12339.38s]  Morello wants to take businesses away from us?
[12339.38s -> 12340.90s]  He'll inherit craters.
[12340.90s -> 12345.22s]  Look, Tom, we can't send Paulie and Sam since all the ladies know them already.
[12345.94s -> 12347.94s]  Are we trying to not have so much heat put on us?
[12347.94s -> 12349.46s]  But you can walk right in.
[12350.34s -> 12352.49s]  Okay.
[12353.35s -> 12355.32s]  What about the manager?
[12355.32s -> 12356.44s]  Like I could syringe somebody.
[12357.48s -> 12360.20s]  If any of the horse see it, well, it'll be a warning.
[12360.76s -> 12363.64s]  Once he's out of the way, head to his office on the top floor.
[12364.20s -> 12367.88s]  Grab any documents and money you find there and place the explosives.
[12367.88s -> 12369.88s]  Vincenza will see that you have what you need.
[12370.60s -> 12373.16s]  And you think the blast will be big enough to give me cover?
[12373.16s -> 12374.84s]  Yeah, but be smart.
[12375.40s -> 12377.56s]  Only take a shot if you know you won't get made.
[12379.03s -> 12380.31s]  Tommy, one more thing.
[12381.27s -> 12384.71s]  One of the girls is passing Morello information about our operations.
[12385.75s -> 12388.87s]  Before you blow the place, you'll need to take care of her, too.
[12390.79s -> 12392.31s]  You want Tommy to kill a twist?
[12393.19s -> 12393.99s]  Come on, Frank.
[12394.55s -> 12396.47s]  It's just bad luck this falls to Tom.
[12397.03s -> 12398.63s]  But we gotta protect the family.
[12399.59s -> 12400.55s]  Her name is Michelle.
[12400.55s -> 12401.19s]  Wait, I have to-
[12401.19s -> 12402.95s]  She's usually working one of the upper rooms.
[12402.95s -> 12404.31s]  Gonna kill some lady?
[12404.31s -> 12405.75s]  Her photo is in the folder.
[12407.03s -> 12408.31s]  You boys clearing everything?
[12414.45s -> 12415.17s]  Yeah.
[12415.17s -> 12416.05s]  Tom.
[12416.05s -> 12416.85s]  Pay attention.
[12417.65s -> 12419.41s]  I got it, boss.
[12419.41s -> 12420.21s]  Then get it done.
[12424.98s -> 12427.30s]  What a reaction to have a thing that you're watching.
[12429.04s -> 12431.12s]  Do I have to kill some lady?
[12431.12s -> 12431.84s]  Yeah, man.
[12431.84s -> 12434.32s]  You probably should already know why and who that is.
[12434.32s -> 12436.93s]  And it's not just some lady you're killing.
[12436.93s -> 12437.97s]  What are you talking about, dude?
[12437.97s -> 12439.17s]  Are you even watching?
[12441.12s -> 12445.04s]  Am I playing, like, Candy Crush on my phone during every cutscene?
[12445.04s -> 12446.24s]  Sometimes it feels like that.
[12455.24s -> 12455.96s]  But I'm not, though.
[12455.96s -> 12458.28s]  I'm just staring blankly into, like, the colors.
[12458.92s -> 12460.32s]  Okay, what do you got for me, Q?
[12463.94s -> 12464.34s]  Thank you.
[12464.90s -> 12469.30s]  Not that special, just electrical tape and dynamite.
[12469.38s -> 12469.86s]  Thanks, Q.
[12490.52s -> 12491.80s]  Uh-oh, we're gonna get some exposition.
[12511.65s -> 12512.53s]  Hey, don't kill her.
[12518.29s -> 12520.77s]  Give it to her and make sure she gets far away.
[12520.77s -> 12521.49s]  A hundred bucks.
[12521.49s -> 12522.13s]  Okay, sir.
[12522.85s -> 12523.89s]  I'll see what I can do.
[12523.89s -> 12525.73s]  A hundred dollars in 1930 was, like, ten grand.
[12525.73s -> 12527.73s]  That's a lot of money.
[12527.73s -> 12535.56s]  This show, she's the one from the racetrack, right?
[12535.56s -> 12538.60s]  Tom, that was the last time we're ever gonna talk about her.
[12538.60s -> 12539.10s]  Ever.
[12539.80s -> 12540.44s]  I told you.
[12540.44s -> 12542.68s]  We won't tell the Don about that one.
[12542.68s -> 12545.08s]  Uh, hey, uh, Polly, was that her?
[12545.08s -> 12545.96s]  Hope not.
[12545.96s -> 12547.00s]  Oh, yeah.
[12547.00s -> 12549.24s]  Tom, that was the last time we were gonna talk about her.
[12549.24s -> 12553.48s]  I told you what I had to ask and you listened.
[12554.12s -> 12555.64s]  You gotta leave it there.
[12555.64s -> 12556.14s]  Okay.
[12558.40s -> 12558.90s]  Oops.
[12563.06s -> 12564.02s]  Okay, we're fine.
[12564.02s -> 12566.26s]  Keep your head when you get into the hotel.
[12566.26s -> 12568.02s]  Find your mark and don't act suspicious.
[12573.40s -> 12574.28s]  Is that for the gunshot?
[12576.12s -> 12577.48s]  One hundred was about 1.2k.
[12578.76s -> 12579.48s]  That's a lot of money.
[12579.48s -> 12580.36s]  You say about it.
[12580.36s -> 12583.83s]  If the bomb goes off, I'll do my thing.
[12583.83s -> 12584.33s]  Got it.
[12588.18s -> 12589.54s]  What's with you today, Tom?
[12590.42s -> 12593.22s]  What kind of world is it?
[12593.54s -> 12594.98s]  I want to ride a motorcycle.
[12594.98s -> 12596.50s]  You get sent to a cat house.
[12597.14s -> 12598.10s]  Well, I have to clean up.
[12599.22s -> 12599.94s]  Shit, wrong button.
[12600.66s -> 12606.10s]  Isn't that a cop right there?
[12610.71s -> 12616.82s]  Anyway, what was I saying?
[12617.70s -> 12618.74s]  Oh, yeah.
[12618.74s -> 12623.94s]  What kind of world is it that when you screw up, you get sent to a cat house?
[12623.94s -> 12626.50s]  Well, I have to clean up your mess at a funeral.
[12626.50s -> 12628.34s]  You see the justice in that?
[12628.34s -> 12628.98s]  I see you.
[12628.98s -> 12629.86s]  Unhinged.
[12629.86s -> 12631.54s]  I was just trying to get the fuck out of the way.
[12632.10s -> 12633.78s]  Just try to finish your job this time.
[12638.26s -> 12639.14s]  Come on.
[12639.14s -> 12642.10s]  Are we going to get everybody standing up on the high ground here?
[12644.26s -> 12644.50s]  What?
[12644.50s -> 12646.66s]  In GTA, you never ran over a pedestrian before?
[12647.62s -> 12648.66s]  Of course not.
[12648.66s -> 12651.70s]  I stopped at every red light and I used my turn signal.
[12652.58s -> 12654.34s]  It's the funerals, Tom.
[12654.34s -> 12655.38s]  That's all it ever.
[12656.39s -> 12656.95s]  Not me.
[12656.95s -> 12658.07s]  No, of course not.
[12658.07s -> 12661.59s]  Anyone ever wants to do is point guns at the family and shoot.
[12661.59s -> 12663.35s]  In point, there were so many funerals.
[12663.35s -> 12664.23s]  I actually do.
[12664.79s -> 12669.20s]  That's how you make GTA, like, a 500-hour game.
[12669.20s -> 12670.32s]  That's a shame.
[12670.32s -> 12672.72s]  Seen as you're always dressed for the occasion.
[12672.72s -> 12673.68s]  Great gag, Tom.
[12674.40s -> 12675.36s]  Write that one down.
[12676.08s -> 12676.48s]  Thanks.
[12677.12s -> 12677.84s]  I'll do that.
[12680.56s -> 12681.84s]  Say that in court, German.
[12682.64s -> 12685.08s]  Here's your stuff.
[12686.21s -> 12687.25s]  But stand up and be like, what?
[12687.25s -> 12688.29s]  You're never in GTA.
[12688.29s -> 12689.25s]  You're in the family.
[12689.25s -> 12691.19s]  Good luck.
[12691.19s -> 12691.91s]  You too.
[12691.91s -> 12693.43s]  Yeah, I would be my own defense.
[12693.99s -> 12696.95s]  Your Honor, in Grand Theft Auto, you can run over people.
[12699.67s -> 12700.79s]  You never done that before, Judge?
[12702.72s -> 12707.76s]  You never ran over an old lady in the crosswalk in GTA?
[12708.48s -> 12714.72s]  Maybe we'd get flustered.
[12714.72s -> 12717.84s]  But well, case dismissed.
[12730.82s -> 12731.38s]  Please.
[12731.38s -> 12731.70s]  OK.
[12732.42s -> 12739.41s]  I didn't say I didn't do it.
[12739.41s -> 12739.97s]  See?
[12739.97s -> 12740.93s]  It was not necessary.
[12740.93s -> 12741.57s]  I didn't have to do it.
[12741.57s -> 12742.45s]  There was no reason to do that.
[12743.17s -> 12745.03s]  I was trying to get out of the way.
[12745.67s -> 12759.03s]  Enter the hotel.
[12759.67s -> 12765.86s]  I have a bomb, don't I?
[12767.22s -> 12767.86s]  Oh, shit.
[12767.86s -> 12768.66s]  Do I have to get searched?
[12769.78s -> 12772.13s]  Send a message from Don Salieri.
[12772.13s -> 12772.77s]  Find Michelle.
[12772.77s -> 12773.89s]  Find the manager.
[12773.89s -> 12775.57s]  Know where I can find the manager?
[12775.57s -> 12777.17s]  I just watched the door, pal.
[12777.17s -> 12788.32s]  Nobody cares.
[12789.20s -> 12790.00s]  OK.
[12790.00s -> 12790.72s]  Find Michelle.
[12793.09s -> 12794.05s]  Hey, handsome.
[12794.05s -> 12795.09s]  You know where I can find Michelle?
[12801.89s -> 12804.29s]  And I got some business with your manager, too.
[12804.29s -> 12805.09s]  A girl?
[12805.09s -> 12807.36s]  I can help you with that.
[12807.36s -> 12807.60s]  Wait.
[12807.60s -> 12808.08s]  Hold on.
[12808.08s -> 12808.96s]  Somebody had a gun.
[12809.76s -> 12813.94s]  Get that away.
[12814.50s -> 12816.26s]  Oh, shit.
[12816.26s -> 12816.50s]  OK.
[12816.50s -> 12816.98s]  He's hidden.
[12824.60s -> 12825.32s]  Find Michelle.
[12831.03s -> 12831.35s]  Michelle.
[12831.35s -> 12833.11s]  Because you're not the dame I'm after.
[12833.11s -> 12834.36s]  No, Michelle.
[12834.36s -> 12835.24s]  I'm new here, baby.
[12835.24s -> 12835.88s]  I don't know a thing.
[12835.88s -> 12838.20s]  Why don't you just walk up to everybody and say, Michelle?
[12839.08s -> 12840.28s]  No, Michelle.
[12840.28s -> 12841.08s]  No, Michelle.
[12841.08s -> 12841.40s]  Yes?
[12842.20s -> 12843.80s]  Or just yell, Michelle.
[12844.76s -> 12845.64s]  Somebody's head's going to turn.
[12845.64s -> 12846.36s]  Yeah, what?
[12846.36s -> 12847.80s]  Hey, I need you.
[12847.80s -> 12849.08s]  I need to speak to Michelle.
[12856.48s -> 12859.44s]  We can just talk if you don't want anything else.
[12860.72s -> 12864.56s]  What's a handsome man like you doing in a place like this?
[12864.56s -> 12866.72s]  Looking for a girl named Michelle.
[12866.72s -> 12869.36s]  She's busy upstairs, but I need to...
[12869.36s -> 12870.24s]  That's all I needed to know?
[12871.04s -> 12874.23s]  Can I get a drink?
[12875.75s -> 12877.11s]  I need to talk to the manager.
[12877.11s -> 12877.91s]  Look at that droid.
[12877.91s -> 12879.72s]  ...straight through the lab.
[12879.72s -> 12882.84s]  Yeah, I'll take a large espresso from the Golden R2-D2, please.
[12882.84s -> 12890.58s]  All right, let's just go upstairs and find Michelle.
[12890.58s -> 12895.00s]  You're looking for a good time in this way, sweetie.
[12895.00s -> 12895.50s]  Michelle?
[12896.04s -> 12898.77s]  Michelle.
[12898.77s -> 12899.97s]  Sure, y'all.
[12899.97s -> 12902.13s]  Come to my room and tell me all about it.
[12902.77s -> 12903.89s]  Uh, okay.
[12903.89s -> 12905.33s]  I just want to talk.
[12905.33s -> 12907.57s]  You know, I get to hear that a lot.
[12907.57s -> 12911.01s]  I bet you're not like all the other guys either, are you?
[12911.01s -> 12912.37s]  Nah, not really.
[12914.64s -> 12916.72s]  Okay, kill the manager in the lounge.
[12916.72s -> 12917.92s]  Why did this become Hitman?
[12925.22s -> 12925.54s]  What?
[12925.54s -> 12926.58s]  Whose room is this?
[12926.58s -> 12928.31s]  Hey, put you in your place.
[12928.31s -> 12929.35s]  You know Michelle.
[12929.35s -> 12930.55s]  She's in 208!
[12930.55s -> 12931.03s]  Get out!
[12931.59s -> 12933.68s]  Sorry for the intrusion.
[12933.68s -> 12935.04s]  It was that easy.
[12935.04s -> 12938.88s]  Okay, 208.
[12938.88s -> 12940.48s]  I don't even need you anymore.
[12940.48s -> 12941.67s]  Where's 208?
[12942.23s -> 12948.93s]  This is 101.
[12948.93s -> 12949.89s]  I don't even need to be in here.
[12949.89s -> 12950.29s]  What am I...
[12950.29s -> 12952.21s]  No, this lady's gonna poison me.
[12952.21s -> 12953.56s]  I'm gonna say she's gonna poison me.
[12953.56s -> 12953.96s]  I know it.
[12954.52s -> 12956.44s]  I guarantee this lady poisons me.
[12956.44s -> 12959.44s]  You're gonna poison me!
[12966.40s -> 12968.48s]  I know I'm gonna get poisoned, I swear to God.
[12968.48s -> 12978.21s]  Is this 208?
[12978.21s -> 12988.10s]  What's in here?
[12993.84s -> 12995.68s]  Everybody is a threat right now.
[12995.68s -> 12997.28s]  It doesn't matter.
[12998.00s -> 12999.30s]  People are gonna kill you.
[12999.30s -> 12999.78s]  They have guns.
[12999.78s -> 13000.50s]  They have knives.
[13000.50s -> 13001.70s]  I'm protecting myself.
[13011.73s -> 13012.29s]  Psycho.
[13018.90s -> 13019.22s]  See?
[13019.22s -> 13020.18s]  Everyone's a fucking threat.
[13020.18s -> 13020.98s]  Look at these threats.
[13020.98s -> 13021.62s]  I'm telling you.
[13027.62s -> 13028.42s]  Wait, who's who?
[13030.02s -> 13031.46s]  Wait, is this a bad guy?
[13031.46s -> 13032.26s]  Who's the bad guy?
[13032.98s -> 13036.05s]  I don't know.
[13036.05s -> 13037.01s]  I don't know which one was the bad guy.
[13037.01s -> 13037.49s]  I have no idea.
[13038.48s -> 13039.12s]  Okay, easy.
[13040.00s -> 13041.14s]  Do you know where Michelle is?
[13042.74s -> 13056.92s]  You're the bad guy on my chest.
[13057.48s -> 13059.62s]  All right, I need to go up.
[13059.62s -> 13062.26s]  Where's the staircase?
[13062.26s -> 13065.94s]  Why is nobody getting me in trouble for doing these crazy things?
[13066.50s -> 13076.92s]  2-0.
[13076.92s -> 13077.32s]  Where is it?
[13091.00s -> 13091.48s]  Bible?
[13091.48s -> 13092.37s]  No.
[13092.37s -> 13092.77s]  Shoes?
[13092.77s -> 13093.01s]  No.
[13093.65s -> 13094.37s]  Car down there.
[13096.53s -> 13097.09s]  Can I change?
[13101.46s -> 13102.26s]  Oh, 2-0-2.
[13102.26s -> 13102.66s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[13102.66s -> 13104.87s]  What's this?
[13104.87s -> 13105.43s]  Yeah, 2-0-2.
[13105.43s -> 13106.07s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[13106.07s -> 13107.19s]  Find Michelle on 2-0-8.
[13107.83s -> 13108.39s]  2-10.
[13108.39s -> 13108.95s]  Where's 2-0-8?
[13109.51s -> 13111.14s]  2-0-1.
[13117.97s -> 13118.93s]  2-0-9.
[13118.93s -> 13119.17s]  Okay.
[13120.96s -> 13122.24s]  2-0-8.
[13122.24s -> 13123.20s]  Oh, it's just on the...
[13123.20s -> 13123.84s]  Okay.
[13123.84s -> 13125.52s]  This is where I have to be.
[13125.52s -> 13126.32s]  Should I knock on the door?
[13138.50s -> 13139.14s]  You, Michelle.
[13139.14s -> 13140.50s]  What's it to you?
[13140.50s -> 13142.74s]  A fella named Sam is one of your regulars.
[13142.74s -> 13144.42s]  Maybe there's a lot of guys named Sam.
[13144.42s -> 13145.38s]  You know him.
[13145.38s -> 13147.30s]  Works for Don Celieri.
[13147.30s -> 13148.82s]  Maybe you got him talking about...
[13148.82s -> 13149.22s]  Excuse me.
[13149.22s -> 13150.18s]  Do you know where Michelle is?
[13151.30s -> 13154.02s]  Don Morello offered you some money to spill what you heard.
[13154.02s -> 13154.42s]  No.
[13154.42s -> 13155.22s]  Sam, trust me.
[13155.78s -> 13156.66s]  I don't say nothing.
[13156.66s -> 13157.14s]  He knows that.
[13157.14s -> 13161.94s]  Well, the Don's losing a lot of money because someone can't keep their mouth shut.
[13161.94s -> 13162.44s]  Hey.
[13178.74s -> 13179.78s]  I didn't kill everybody.
[13180.34s -> 13184.21s]  The first lady I thought was gonna...
[13184.21s -> 13186.85s]  The door was gonna close and she was gonna stab me or poison me or something.
[13189.28s -> 13189.84s]  Second room.
[13190.88s -> 13191.68s]  There's two guys in there.
[13191.68s -> 13192.24s]  One of them was beaten.
[13192.24s -> 13192.88s]  One of them I choked.
[13192.88s -> 13193.20s]  One of them.
[13193.20s -> 13194.08s]  Then I punched the other guy.
[13194.08s -> 13196.48s]  Because if you ever show your face in this town again,
[13196.48s -> 13198.08s]  they're gonna find you with two in the head.
[13200.55s -> 13201.51s]  Do you understand?
[13202.47s -> 13208.68s]  What about the security guard?
[13208.68s -> 13209.72s]  Yeah, that's true.
[13211.11s -> 13211.83s]  I can't, uh...
[13211.83s -> 13213.11s]  Get dressed and make tracks.
[13213.11s -> 13214.55s]  I have no excuse for the security guard.
[13214.55s -> 13215.27s]  I just kind of did it.
[13215.75s -> 13223.54s]  Just don't come back and we're square.
[13224.58s -> 13234.07s]  All right.
[13234.07s -> 13236.69s]  We're good.
[13236.69s -> 13238.13s]  Kill the manager in the lounge.
[13240.71s -> 13244.05s]  Killing everybody besides the manager in the lounge.
[13244.05s -> 13245.01s]  Don't I have a bomb?
[13245.57s -> 13258.24s]  Back downstairs.
[13258.80s -> 13267.88s]  Oh, it's okay.
[13267.88s -> 13268.92s]  Someone's just jumping on the bed.
[13282.71s -> 13283.19s]  Psycho.
[13290.44s -> 13291.00s]  All right.
[13291.00s -> 13294.82s]  Don't hurt anybody.
[13294.82s -> 13296.85s]  There he is.
[13296.85s -> 13297.17s]  All right.
[13297.17s -> 13298.05s]  How do I kill this guy?
[13301.22s -> 13303.94s]  I guess I just go walk up and put my hands on his neck.
[13303.94s -> 13305.06s]  But I don't think that's gonna work.
[13313.86s -> 13314.50s]  Can I talk to him?
[13321.91s -> 13326.18s]  No, this is gonna be some weird hitman thing to do with this.
[13326.18s -> 13328.39s]  I'm gonna drop a chandelier on him or something, right?
[13336.48s -> 13336.88s]  Poison?
[13338.07s -> 13340.15s]  Why do I think there's poison in this game?
[13340.15s -> 13341.67s]  It's not showing up at all.
[13342.55s -> 13344.23s]  Why did I think I was gonna get poisoned?
[13344.87s -> 13346.96s]  Like, here, have a drink.
[13346.96s -> 13347.76s]  And I was gonna die.
[13347.76s -> 13349.04s]  Why did I think that was gonna happen?
[13349.68s -> 13356.87s]  I actually just have to kill this guy, I guess.
[13359.14s -> 13359.38s]  Uh...
[13359.94s -> 13369.24s]  Oh, he'll go to the bathroom.
[13370.20s -> 13371.32s]  He's gonna go to the bathroom eventually.
[13371.32s -> 13373.16s]  And we'll just chuck him out of the bathroom.
[13383.80s -> 13384.20s]  Shoot him.
[13385.60s -> 13387.04s]  No, I don't want to shoot him.
[13387.04s -> 13388.48s]  Why is there blood all over the place?
[13391.60s -> 13392.56s]  Oh, it's me.
[13401.08s -> 13401.88s]  He's not gonna move.
[13401.88s -> 13402.68s]  Just shoot him.
[13403.24s -> 13405.32s]  Everyone called me a psycho when I punched that lady
[13405.32s -> 13407.08s]  and when I choked that guy to death.
[13407.08s -> 13408.52s]  I don't want to be the psycho anymore.
[13408.52s -> 13418.84s]  I want to do the correct way.
[13418.84s -> 13419.88s]  Run, run, run, run, run!
[13424.00s -> 13424.32s]  Run!
[13425.91s -> 13427.83s]  I don't know if that's a good...
[13427.83s -> 13428.79s]  I don't know if that's a bad guy or not.
[13429.67s -> 13431.19s]  Reach the manager's office?
[13431.19s -> 13431.43s]  What?
[13444.26s -> 13444.82s]  What's the go...
[13446.34s -> 13452.16s]  I don't want to be the psycho.
[13452.16s -> 13452.56s]  I wasn't.
[13452.56s -> 13454.00s]  I was running away.
[13454.00s -> 13455.60s]  I did what I had to do and I ran away.
[13456.32s -> 13459.00s]  What is happening?
[13459.00s -> 13459.24s]  Oh.
[13459.96s -> 13461.57s]  I don't want to...
[13465.59s -> 13466.23s]  Um...
[13466.23s -> 13471.86s]  Don't listen to chat.
[13471.86s -> 13473.46s]  Just go and reach the manager's office.
[13474.18s -> 13475.08s]  This guy...
[13475.08s -> 13478.12s]  Okay, like the concierge just ran in with a shotgun.
[13478.12s -> 13480.36s]  And you're telling me that not everybody here was a threat?
[13480.36s -> 13482.55s]  That was the bellhop.
[13482.55s -> 13501.09s]  I gotta go, uh, game mode for this one.
[13501.81s -> 13513.78s]  All right, reach the manager's office.
[13513.78s -> 13514.10s]  Let's go.
[13514.74s -> 13518.42s]  I'll take the shotgun.
[13519.06s -> 13519.78s]  Oh, hell yeah.
[13519.78s -> 13520.74s]  All right, let's go reload this.
[13532.52s -> 13533.08s]  Oh, shit.
[13533.08s -> 13533.56s]  Where is he?
[13534.12s -> 13540.76s]  Oh, give me the...
[13541.32s -> 13553.35s]  Oh, yourself.
[13553.35s -> 13555.51s]  Neither one of us knows who we're aiming at right now.
[13555.51s -> 13569.09s]  Is there a heal?
[13569.09s -> 13570.21s]  There's no heal box, is there?
[13575.57s -> 13575.89s]  Where?
[13576.45s -> 13586.04s]  Oh, back in the kitchen?
[13586.60s -> 13592.28s]  I don't...
[13592.28s -> 13598.28s]  Where?
[13598.28s -> 13598.68s]  Sick.
[13598.68s -> 13599.00s]  Thank you.
[13603.48s -> 13604.12s]  There we go.
[13604.12s -> 13606.04s]  Now I got tons of ammo for the shotgun.
[13606.04s -> 13606.36s]  We're good.
[13627.40s -> 13629.16s]  I just like skimmed him.
[13629.16s -> 13642.39s]  Nobody left, all right?
[13642.39s -> 13649.09s]  I have no idea.
[13650.21s -> 13651.01s]  Oh, my goodness.
[13660.07s -> 13660.95s]  Everybody's a threat.
[13661.51s -> 13662.55s]  Everybody's a threat.
[13663.44s -> 13664.56s]  Even the naked guy.
[13679.62s -> 13680.10s]  Whoa!
[13680.90s -> 13699.16s]  Where is he?
[13699.16s -> 13707.65s]  Any health in here?
[13707.65s -> 13711.01s]  Oh, shit.
[13723.78s -> 13731.00s]  Remember, this is not a kill everyone scenario.
[13731.00s -> 13732.52s]  This is a get out scenario.
[13732.52s -> 13734.79s]  All right, that's cool.
[13734.87s -> 13743.78s]  Just run.
[13743.78s -> 13745.86s]  Your game reward is causing lag.
[13745.86s -> 13771.38s]  Where's his office?
[13775.92s -> 13776.96s]  I was right there.
[13776.96s -> 13777.60s]  Shit.
[13777.60s -> 13783.86s]  Oh, god damn it.
[13783.86s -> 13785.68s]  That was so close.
[13785.68s -> 13789.22s]  It actually worked for a minute.
[13789.22s -> 13793.01s]  Why are you playing with a controller?
[13793.01s -> 13794.85s]  Because my game reward's gonna get in the way
[13794.85s -> 13796.45s]  and it's gonna hurt if I press W.
[13796.45s -> 13797.57s]  Because when I press W,
[13797.57s -> 13800.23s]  it's gonna scrape against the E key.
[13800.23s -> 13802.07s]  I mean, the mouse.
[13802.07s -> 13802.63s]  The mouse...
[13802.63s -> 13803.35s]  No, it's not even...
[13803.35s -> 13804.23s]  That's a wrong hand.
[13804.87s -> 13817.86s]  I got a checkpoint, though.
[13817.86s -> 13821.76s]  Somebody else shot him in the head, not me.
[13822.40s -> 13838.29s]  Oh, shit.
[13838.29s -> 13851.51s]  Into the hallway, that's it.
[13851.51s -> 13852.79s]  I'm just gonna get to the end of the hallway.
[13852.79s -> 13872.40s]  I was doing like covering fire.
[13872.40s -> 13874.02s]  There's another guy right there.
[13874.02s -> 13885.40s]  Jesus, that's why I don't want to run.
[13886.04s -> 13893.16s]  Did I shoot myself in the side of the head?
[13893.16s -> 13901.03s]  Did I lean forward to peek and then shoot myself?
[13901.03s -> 13926.95s]  Dude, give me a fucking break.
[13926.95s -> 13928.79s]  Where is this guy shooting at me from?
[13928.79s -> 13940.32s]  Shit, that was a loud yell.
[13940.32s -> 13952.26s]  He did not fucking hit me.
[13952.26s -> 13968.16s]  I'm just saying bullshit.
[13968.16s -> 13969.28s]  I had explosive right here.
[13969.28s -> 13969.78s]  Ready?
[13974.20s -> 13977.14s]  Fucking come on.
[13977.14s -> 13988.69s]  It's lower the difficulty to regular.
[13988.69s -> 13990.13s]  Don't be on classic mode.
[13990.13s -> 13992.16s]  I'm not gonna put it...
[13992.16s -> 13993.60s]  No, I can't do that more than once.
[13993.60s -> 14002.92s]  You know why I hate video games so much?
[14003.00s -> 14006.68s]  Because you have to put your mouse sensitivity
[14006.68s -> 14009.24s]  down to like 0.5 in every fucking video game.
[14009.24s -> 14009.80s]  Do you guys realize?
[14009.80s -> 14010.44s]  Do you guys notice that?
[14010.44s -> 14011.32s]  Who the fuck play...
[14011.32s -> 14015.49s]  Why would they ever have a like 5.0 sensitivity?
[14015.49s -> 14017.81s]  What's the point of having that even be an option?
[14017.81s -> 14028.31s]  It's a little too low.
[14028.31s -> 14044.52s]  Why does this feel so laggy?
[14045.24s -> 14048.64s]  I think it's because it is.
[14049.20s -> 14072.69s]  All right, the same stupid...
[14072.69s -> 14078.36s]  Get up.
[14078.36s -> 14079.24s]  It's gonna explode.
[14079.24s -> 14080.44s]  Just get rid of it first.
[14080.44s -> 14082.24s]  Someone's gonna shoot that.
[14082.24s -> 14082.88s]  It's gonna kill me.
[14083.52s -> 14093.33s]  That's just ducking in plain sight.
[14093.33s -> 14094.53s]  The controller was sitting on my lap.
[14094.53s -> 14095.73s]  I put it on the desk.
[14095.73s -> 14105.57s]  Turn on aim assist.
[14105.57s -> 14107.09s]  Wouldn't I want to turn it off?
[14107.09s -> 14114.64s]  Is it like pulling me over to other enemies?
[14114.64s -> 14131.41s]  Fucking die!
[14132.13s -> 14140.93s]  Game's at...
[14140.93s -> 14141.49s]  It's bugged.
[14141.49s -> 14142.61s]  Turn on v-sync.
[14142.61s -> 14143.09s]  I don't think...
[14143.09s -> 14143.81s]  Is that real?
[14143.81s -> 14148.50s]  I don't think that's real.
[14149.06s -> 14151.49s]  You're alive?
[14152.13s -> 14158.26s]  You gotta turn vegetation on...
[14158.26s -> 14159.06s]  All right, this...
[14159.06s -> 14160.42s]  Same fucking doorway.
[14165.20s -> 14168.95s]  There he is.
[14168.95s -> 14170.63s]  You can't be serious.
[14170.63s -> 14171.27s]  Same guy.
[14171.27s -> 14176.68s]  He shoots me in the head every time.
[14176.68s -> 14179.16s]  Why is this guy so impossible for me to kill?
[14179.16s -> 14197.88s]  I shot him right in the neck.
[14197.88s -> 14198.44s]  What was that?
[14203.99s -> 14205.51s]  Oh my fucking God.
[14205.51s -> 14206.47s]  Why is it like this?
[14232.34s -> 14234.10s]  Here's the gamer instinct.
[14234.10s -> 14239.83s]  Oh my fucking God.
[14239.83s -> 14240.47s]  Are you...
[14240.47s -> 14241.35s]  Are you kidding me?
[14241.35s -> 14244.39s]  Because I replaced my gun in the beginning of the level
[14244.39s -> 14246.55s]  when I choked out the fucking bellhop
[14246.55s -> 14255.14s]  and I took the shitty gun.
[14255.14s -> 14255.54s]  Really?
[14256.48s -> 14257.36s]  Really?
[14257.36s -> 14257.76s]  No.
[14257.76s -> 14259.12s]  All right, I gotta replace this gun.
[14259.76s -> 14265.38s]  This thing sucks.
[14265.38s -> 14266.98s]  I'm like shooting BBs at these guys.
[14267.62s -> 14271.33s]  Give me your gun.
[14271.33s -> 14273.08s]  What do you have?
[14273.08s -> 14273.48s]  Thank you.
[14273.48s -> 14274.28s]  Oh my God.
[14276.55s -> 14277.83s]  What the hell was I thinking?
[14278.71s -> 14280.08s]  What was I doing?
[14280.08s -> 14280.96s]  What was wrong with me?
[14300.04s -> 14300.76s]  What are you doing?
[14301.24s -> 14307.86s]  The guy in the hat.
[14312.80s -> 14313.60s]  This guy's in my head.
[14314.16s -> 14315.84s]  This dude is in my head so bad.
[14315.84s -> 14316.32s]  He really is.
[14321.08s -> 14321.32s]  Yeah.
[14322.04s -> 14323.00s]  I shot that guy.
[14323.00s -> 14323.32s]  Okay.
[14323.32s -> 14323.88s]  I don't even know what happened.
[14323.88s -> 14324.76s]  That guy exploded.
[14336.74s -> 14337.38s]  No, don't.
[14341.76s -> 14342.56s]  Use your grenades.
[14342.56s -> 14343.92s]  I don't have any grenades.
[14343.92s -> 14352.80s]  Get up.
[14352.80s -> 14353.04s]  Shit.
[14353.60s -> 14364.20s]  Come on, dude.
[14364.20s -> 14367.49s]  I don't have any bullets.
[14367.49s -> 14368.05s]  Oh shit.
[14368.05s -> 14368.61s]  Give me the controller.
[14368.61s -> 14369.57s]  I don't know what to do.
[14369.57s -> 14371.27s]  Do I have anything else?
[14371.27s -> 14378.61s]  Give me another gun.
[14378.61s -> 14379.41s]  Give me a gun.
[14379.41s -> 14385.84s]  No.
[14385.84s -> 14407.08s]  There's one more guy.
[14408.44s -> 14417.59s]  There's no bullets in any of these guns.
[14427.14s -> 14428.82s]  What are you doing?
[14428.82s -> 14435.35s]  I don't even know where he is.
[14435.83s -> 14452.21s]  Where is he?
[14452.21s -> 14452.77s]  Holy shit.
[14452.77s -> 14453.49s]  What an idiot.
[14453.49s -> 14458.24s]  Get the safe.
[14458.24s -> 14463.03s]  I'll take this one for sure.
[14463.03s -> 14464.31s]  This is a sawed-off shotgun.
[14464.31s -> 14485.19s]  Why does this guy have a spotlight all over him?
[14486.79s -> 14487.75s]  Can I get him out?
[14487.75s -> 14490.23s]  Clown?
[14490.23s -> 14495.43s]  No, I'm not going to kill this guy.
[14495.43s -> 14496.15s]  Okay?
[14496.15s -> 14498.31s]  I am not going to do that.
[14498.31s -> 14499.65s]  I've done enough.
[14499.65s -> 14503.01s]  I've done enough like punching and fighting and shooting and stuff.
[14503.01s -> 14504.21s]  I'm not going to do it.
[14504.21s -> 14505.01s]  Not going to happen.
[14505.01s -> 14508.56s]  Not right now.
[14508.56s -> 14509.36s]  Shoot the chair.
[14509.36s -> 14509.68s]  All right.
[14509.68s -> 14511.12s]  I might shoot the chair.
[14511.92s -> 14521.73s]  Can I shoot the chair without killing him?
[14521.73s -> 14523.49s]  You're going to blow up the what?
[14523.49s -> 14525.60s]  Oh wait.
[14525.60s -> 14526.32s]  This guy's...
[14526.32s -> 14526.48s]  Yeah.
[14526.48s -> 14527.04s]  How do I...
[14527.36s -> 14528.48s]  I'm going to blow up the whole building?
[14529.12s -> 14536.58s]  Take money and documents.
[14536.58s -> 14537.14s]  Okay?
[14537.14s -> 14543.17s]  Get that document.
[14543.17s -> 14543.81s]  Money.
[14543.81s -> 14545.28s]  Documents.
[14545.28s -> 14550.76s]  Land the bomb.
[14550.76s -> 14551.89s]  Does it matter where?
[14551.89s -> 14559.38s]  That clown guy really is just kind of still in there.
[14559.38s -> 14582.37s]  He's just tied up.
[14582.37s -> 14597.04s]  Okay.
[14597.04s -> 14598.32s]  I blew out an office.
[14598.32s -> 14600.72s]  I didn't blow up the building.
[14600.72s -> 14606.50s]  Oh, we're good.
[14606.50s -> 14608.15s]  Get to the roof?
[14608.95s -> 14623.27s]  Are those police shooting at me?
[14623.27s -> 14635.14s]  Why does it look like my body was on backwards?
[14635.14s -> 14648.16s]  Can I find a way up to the roof?
[14649.86s -> 14655.27s]  All right.
[14655.27s -> 14656.87s]  But where are they actually shooting?
[14656.87s -> 14666.93s]  I don't think I can get rid of these guys.
[14666.93s -> 14674.84s]  I have a shotgun that I'm going to shoot into windows
[14674.84s -> 14677.28s]  that are like 500 feet away from me.
[14698.34s -> 14700.74s]  Restart chapter.
[14700.74s -> 14702.10s]  Oh my goodness.
[14702.10s -> 14714.15s]  I am going to have to just run.
[14714.15s -> 14714.55s]  Slow down.
[14714.55s -> 14715.27s]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[14715.91s -> 14728.77s]  What difficulty is this?
[14728.77s -> 14729.57s]  Classic.
[14729.57s -> 14735.20s]  Hide and just heal.
[14735.20s -> 14751.01s]  Do I have any other guns?
[14751.01s -> 14751.89s]  I don't.
[14751.89s -> 14754.61s]  I just have a stupid shotgun, man.
[14755.33s -> 14776.04s]  I can get them.
[14776.04s -> 14776.52s]  Oh, shit.
[14777.16s -> 14782.02s]  I get them?
[14782.02s -> 14782.74s]  I got them.
[14782.74s -> 14784.40s]  Go, go!
[14784.40s -> 14785.52s]  While they're distracted while they're shot.
[14786.08s -> 14801.60s]  I'm in trouble now.
[14801.60s -> 14805.89s]  Why did I switch to the dumb shotgun?
[14806.45s -> 14807.49s]  Because it was on the ground
[14807.49s -> 14809.01s]  and I thought it might be fun to use.
[14813.57s -> 14813.97s]  All right.
[14814.69s -> 14819.25s]  What am I going to do?
[14826.87s -> 14828.15s]  I think I have to kill these guys.
[14834.08s -> 14839.27s]  Are they gone?
[14839.27s -> 14840.23s]  I saw the guy in the eye.
[14840.23s -> 14841.19s]  That guy doesn't have an eye.
[14841.83s -> 14842.37s]  All right.
[14842.37s -> 14842.85s]  One's dead.
[14843.49s -> 14844.21s]  One of them is dead.
[14844.85s -> 14851.65s]  This is my actual opportunity here.
[14851.65s -> 14852.53s]  I'm going to wait till they reload
[14852.53s -> 14853.49s]  and then I'm going to run.
[14853.49s -> 14855.89s]  Two, three, four, five, six.
[14856.45s -> 14856.69s]  Okay.
[14856.69s -> 14856.93s]  Ready?
[14857.49s -> 14858.21s]  Let's count.
[14859.03s -> 14861.35s]  Three, five, six.
[14861.35s -> 14867.97s]  Two, three, four.
[14867.97s -> 14869.65s]  One, two, three, four, five, six.
[14869.65s -> 14870.13s]  Five, six.
[14872.92s -> 14884.58s]  And one, two.
[14884.58s -> 14884.90s]  Come on.
[14884.90s -> 14886.64s]  I'm not going to fire.
[14887.36s -> 14903.44s]  Okay.
[14903.44s -> 14904.40s]  I'm all right.
[14904.40s -> 14905.96s]  Nobody right here.
[14905.96s -> 14906.60s]  I don't have a gun.
[14914.77s -> 14916.13s]  Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[14916.13s -> 14916.53s]  There's a guy.
[14916.53s -> 14917.17s]  There's a guy with a gun
[14917.17s -> 14918.69s]  but this is a health pack right here.
[14918.69s -> 14927.84s]  Move these boxes.
[14927.84s -> 14928.64s]  Get out of my way, please.
[14929.20s -> 14931.14s]  Can I zip line?
[14931.14s -> 14934.04s]  There's a dude right here with a gun.
[14937.41s -> 14937.81s]  I didn't.
[14951.17s -> 14951.89s]  Holy shit.
[14951.89s -> 14952.53s]  I'm okay.
[14952.53s -> 14963.00s]  I got one more bullet.
[14963.00s -> 14972.82s]  Which guns?
[14973.38s -> 14980.98s]  I need that gun.
[14980.98s -> 14981.38s]  Where is it?
[14991.38s -> 15000.42s]  All right.
[15000.42s -> 15001.62s]  Well, I'm headshotting his hand.
[15014.69s -> 15015.81s]  Headshotting the fence.
[15017.51s -> 15018.47s]  Kind of, but not really.
[15029.12s -> 15029.52s]  Don't do it.
[15029.52s -> 15030.08s]  It's not worth it.
[15030.08s -> 15030.56s]  It's not worth it.
[15030.56s -> 15030.96s]  It's not worth it.
[15030.96s -> 15031.44s]  It's not worth it.
[15031.44s -> 15032.16s]  Hide, hide, hide, hide.
[15032.16s -> 15032.56s]  It's not worth it.
[15032.56s -> 15033.84s]  Dude, what the fuck are you doing?
[15033.84s -> 15034.48s]  It's not worth it.
[15034.48s -> 15034.88s]  It's not worth it.
[15034.88s -> 15035.68s]  It's not worth it.
[15035.68s -> 15070.15s]  Give me your gun.
[15070.15s -> 15070.55s]  Give me your gun.
[15070.55s -> 15071.35s]  I want ammo.
[15071.35s -> 15083.51s]  Shit.
[15083.51s -> 15086.47s]  Guy right here.
[15086.47s -> 15087.03s]  Oh, okay.
[15087.03s -> 15087.75s]  We're safe.
[15087.75s -> 15093.81s]  Spike's on there.
[15093.81s -> 15094.77s]  I can't jump over that.
[15094.77s -> 15124.36s]  I thought it was a jump.
[15124.36s -> 15124.60s]  Cool.
[15124.60s -> 15124.84s]  All right.
[15124.84s -> 15134.74s]  So far so good.
[15134.74s -> 15135.38s]  All joke?
[15135.38s -> 15135.94s]  No.
[15135.94s -> 15138.92s]  I don't think you can fall off.
[15138.92s -> 15139.88s]  Even if you tried.
[15139.88s -> 15155.22s]  Try, try, try.
[15155.22s -> 15155.62s]  I can't.
[15155.62s -> 15156.58s]  I can't even fall down.
[15156.58s -> 15165.76s]  How far we've fallen.
[15165.76s -> 15168.24s]  We can find redemption in death.
[15168.24s -> 15169.20s]  This is just going on now.
[15169.20s -> 15169.60s]  Okay.
[15169.60s -> 15170.16s]  Now, William.
[15171.12s -> 15172.40s]  He was a sinner, yes.
[15173.20s -> 15175.99s]  But he was also a loving son.
[15192.96s -> 15194.39s]  Oilus from Mafia.
[15195.11s -> 15197.89s]  You're here right now.
[15199.97s -> 15200.61s]  In real time.
[15200.61s -> 15201.73s]  I just wanted to pay my respects.
[15201.73s -> 15202.21s]  Watching it.
[15203.48s -> 15204.20s]  Billy.
[15204.20s -> 15205.94s]  I never said this.
[15205.94s -> 15212.32s]  But I consider you my brother.
[15212.32s -> 15214.08s]  I can't even count all the times.
[15214.08s -> 15215.44s]  You saved my ass from a beating.
[15217.20s -> 15218.98s]  I don't know how I'm gonna-
[15218.98s -> 15219.48s]  Sweet.
[15220.18s -> 15220.68s]  Wait.
[15221.22s -> 15221.86s]  That's the guy.
[15222.42s -> 15224.02s]  That's the guy who killed Billy.
[15224.02s -> 15224.52s]  No.
[15226.02s -> 15226.74s]  Funeral?
[15226.74s -> 15227.38s]  Excuse me.
[15228.66s -> 15229.30s]  I'm telling you.
[15229.30s -> 15230.02s]  Everybody's a threat.
[15230.02s -> 15230.82s]  Everyone just has a gun.
[15231.94s -> 15233.32s]  This whole-
[15233.32s -> 15235.16s]  Everybody just stood up with machine guns and shit.
[15236.04s -> 15241.68s]  Kill Johnny.
[15242.24s -> 15248.18s]  Johnny?
[15248.18s -> 15248.98s]  That's Johnny over there.
[15258.68s -> 15259.00s]  All right.
[15259.00s -> 15259.96s]  Got him.
[15259.96s -> 15267.20s]  Give me that.
[15267.20s -> 15267.52s]  Wait.
[15267.52s -> 15268.40s]  Pocket revolver.
[15268.40s -> 15269.12s]  That sounds cool.
[15270.02s -> 15270.18s]  No.
[15270.18s -> 15270.90s]  That thing sucks.
[15271.54s -> 15276.40s]  The guy threw a molotov in a church.
[15276.96s -> 15277.28s]  Yeah.
[15279.33s -> 15279.97s]  Yeah, he did.
[15280.61s -> 15293.03s]  I'm sorry.
[15293.67s -> 15294.40s]  I'm sorry.
[15294.40s -> 15295.52s]  Everybody was doing it.
[15295.52s -> 15296.64s]  So I thought I would do it too.
[15297.60s -> 15298.56s]  Everyone was doing it.
[15299.12s -> 15304.50s]  I'm just such a creature of being able to be easily visually manipulated.
[15316.29s -> 15317.97s]  This is what was Billy involved in.
[15317.97s -> 15319.25s]  Get over here now.
[15319.25s -> 15328.90s]  Playing a game with a controller without any aim assist on.
[15328.90s -> 15329.86s]  That's another issue, I think.
[15330.66s -> 15333.70s]  Damn.
[15333.70s -> 15334.74s]  I'm just realizing that right now.
[15335.30s -> 15350.60s]  Take care of this guy, Fart.
[15350.60s -> 15353.11s]  That was sick.
[15353.67s -> 15355.44s]  Warming him up?
[15355.44s -> 15355.94s]  Who?
[15361.60s -> 15362.72s]  Oh, he's right there.
[15362.72s -> 15373.92s]  Why did the game just slow mo for that guy?
[15373.92s -> 15374.16s]  See?
[15374.16s -> 15375.20s]  I told you he's doing it.
[15375.20s -> 15376.00s]  Look it.
[15376.00s -> 15377.91s]  I have enough bullets.
[15377.91s -> 15380.74s]  What's going on?
[15380.74s -> 15384.39s]  Is my computer overheating?
[15404.80s -> 15409.11s]  Oh!
[15409.11s -> 15409.59s]  Fuck!
[15409.59s -> 15411.59s]  The shotgun was on the ground.
[15421.48s -> 15424.44s]  He punched me over the thing twice and I got stun locked.
[15449.80s -> 15465.54s]  Who's next?
[15465.54s -> 15465.94s]  Come on.
[15467.36s -> 15467.84s]  Yeah, cool.
[15468.40s -> 15477.83s]  Is that just Fortnite, that guy?
[15477.83s -> 15480.63s]  I think I got him.
[15480.63s -> 15481.11s]  Is that him?
[15492.63s -> 15493.51s]  What's with the gun, man?
[15511.99s -> 15512.95s]  Over here, right?
[15512.95s -> 15518.32s]  There he is.
[15518.32s -> 15518.56s]  Okay.
[15518.56s -> 15518.96s]  Let's go.
[15519.52s -> 15521.28s]  Leave vault on keyboard.
[15521.92s -> 15532.53s]  Hand grenade.
[15532.53s -> 15533.33s]  Holy hand grenade.
[15533.33s -> 15534.05s]  What?
[15534.05s -> 15538.50s]  Not yet, not yet, not yet.
[15538.50s -> 15538.90s]  Give me this.
[15538.90s -> 15540.50s]  This is the way this city works.
[15540.50s -> 15547.25s]  It's out of ammo?
[15547.25s -> 15554.79s]  I don't know how to punch.
[15554.79s -> 15555.35s]  I don't know how to punch.
[15555.35s -> 15555.83s]  How do you punch?
[15557.19s -> 15559.43s]  I don't know how to punch on the fucking keyboard.
[15560.80s -> 15562.24s]  I'm swapping between the two.
[15562.96s -> 15568.31s]  Is left alt?
[15568.31s -> 15576.68s]  Stop reloading.
[15576.68s -> 15577.80s]  You're wasting your ammo.
[15612.00s -> 15613.44s]  Oh my god.
[15613.44s -> 15616.72s]  That guy got shot like seven fucking times.
[15616.72s -> 15633.88s]  You did not get that off.
[15633.88s -> 15634.76s]  You motherfucker.
[15634.76s -> 15635.56s]  I can't believe you got it.
[15647.70s -> 15648.74s]  Stop fucking.
[15648.74s -> 15649.46s]  It's such a habit.
[15649.46s -> 15650.10s]  I'm sorry, it is.
[15650.82s -> 15668.47s]  This is the way this city works.
[15678.40s -> 15679.60s]  Oh, there's a machine gun right here.
[15680.16s -> 15680.98s]  Give me that thing.
[15681.62s -> 15689.46s]  Where is he?
[15689.46s -> 15695.75s]  That's it, right?
[15695.75s -> 15696.31s]  Okay, let's go.
[15696.31s -> 15711.54s]  Please, I'm enjoying this.
[15711.54s -> 15719.59s]  What have you done?
[15720.88s -> 15722.32s]  Murder in the house of God.
[15723.20s -> 15725.84s]  These men were criminals, father.
[15727.73s -> 15731.88s]  Thieves, rapists, killers.
[15732.52s -> 15736.28s]  And God would have embraced them if they'd asked for forgiveness.
[15736.28s -> 15737.08s]  That's hard.
[15737.08s -> 15740.68s]  Now, which one of these men might have sought redemption by working with the poor?
[15741.75s -> 15744.31s]  Which one might have saved just one life?
[15744.31s -> 15745.75s]  None of us, father.
[15747.96s -> 15749.24s]  You bastard.
[15749.24s -> 15749.72s]  Wait, didn't...
[15750.52s -> 15752.37s]  Do you have any confessions to make?
[15752.37s -> 15753.65s]  You better do it quick.
[15753.65s -> 15755.41s]  No more bloodshed, please.
[15755.41s -> 15758.05s]  I'm gonna just fill him with like eight rounds of...
[15758.05s -> 15759.25s]  I shot him with a machine gun, didn't I?
[15759.81s -> 15763.40s]  Consider this an act of divine retribution.
[15771.72s -> 15772.68s]  That make us even.
[15774.92s -> 15777.32s]  Sure. For now.
[15780.64s -> 15784.24s]  For your trouble, father.
[15785.04s -> 15785.84s]  Still alive.
[15785.84s -> 15787.20s]  I don't want your blood money.
[15788.87s -> 15789.75s]  You took theirs.
[15791.86s -> 15793.86s]  Not a lot of difference from where I'm standing.
[15796.53s -> 15799.01s]  There should be enough dough to patch up the bullet holes.
[15799.97s -> 15801.17s]  And keep you quiet.
[15803.20s -> 15810.77s]  When the cops come, you tell them the gunman who did this had East Coast accents.
[15811.99s -> 15813.59s]  We're really doing this to a priest?
[15813.59s -> 15816.79s]  I've been out of town, right?
[15816.79s -> 15822.36s]  I won't lie, but I won't say anything at all.
[15822.36s -> 15826.26s]  Good. Be ashamed if we had to come back here.
[15827.30s -> 15828.74s]  Am I gonna the priest?
[15829.46s -> 15830.68s]  Were you?
[15830.68s -> 15833.40s]  As soon as I walked in the church, the crew recognized me.
[15833.96s -> 15835.48s]  Followed me straight back out.
[15835.48s -> 15836.44s]  Holy shit, man.
[15855.96s -> 15856.44s]  My spot.
[15866.63s -> 15867.27s]  I'm not sure.
[15867.27s -> 15867.67s]  I'm just...
[15876.72s -> 15877.60s]  Where's the car?
[15878.32s -> 15879.04s]  Where's the car?
[15879.76s -> 15882.12s]  I gotta get in the car.
[15882.12s -> 15882.84s]  Oh, shit.
[15882.84s -> 15883.48s]  Okay, it's all right.
[15884.04s -> 15896.21s]  Stay here.
[15896.21s -> 15898.48s]  Get over here and don't move.
[15926.05s -> 15928.84s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, Polly.
[15928.84s -> 15929.56s]  What are you doing?
[15929.56s -> 15931.00s]  Stay back here, Polly.
[15934.80s -> 15946.28s]  We need a car.
[15946.28s -> 15950.45s]  Can you steal a car?
[15951.09s -> 15960.68s]  No, that's illegal.
[15961.16s -> 15968.82s]  How you doing?
[15968.82s -> 15970.26s]  All right, get out.
[15970.26s -> 15971.22s]  I'm getting...
[15971.78s -> 15974.95s]  Oh, there's a million police right there.
[15974.95s -> 15976.23s]  We did that real close.
[15976.87s -> 15985.06s]  Returning to the scene of the crime.
[15990.18s -> 15991.78s]  Yes, there was a stolen car.
[15991.78s -> 15992.26s]  You're right.
[15992.26s -> 15998.93s]  Well, today didn't turn out like I expected.
[15998.93s -> 16002.00s]  Oh, they know it's me?
[16002.00s -> 16002.88s]  I don't think they know it's me.
[16003.52s -> 16014.56s]  Whatever you did at the cat house got the cops plenty pissed.
[16014.56s -> 16017.36s]  Yeah, it was messy, but I got everything done.
[16017.92s -> 16018.96s]  Everything?
[16018.96s -> 16021.62s]  Yeah, everything.
[16021.62s -> 16025.97s]  Right into the car.
[16025.97s -> 16026.53s]  Right into the train.
[16027.33s -> 16031.43s]  Shit, I want a bike so bad.
[16032.15s -> 16033.51s]  We both ride the bike at the same time.
[16036.39s -> 16037.67s]  They giving up yet?
[16037.67s -> 16038.95s]  I don't think so.
[16038.95s -> 16040.95s]  They must have called out every cop in the city.
[16042.79s -> 16043.29s]  Move.
[16056.60s -> 16057.24s]  I'm doing it.
[16057.96s -> 16060.45s]  All right, get out of the car up here.
[16060.45s -> 16061.01s]  Into the park.
[16061.65s -> 16064.52s]  Get out, get out.
[16064.52s -> 16065.56s]  Run, run, quick, quick, quick, quick.
[16065.56s -> 16066.28s]  Get this way over here.
[16091.32s -> 16092.60s]  He's behind the newspaper.
[16100.74s -> 16101.30s]  No, I can't...
[16102.42s -> 16103.62s]  I can't just punch people.
[16104.58s -> 16110.10s]  I already punched my quota of ladies in the face today, okay?
[16110.10s -> 16111.30s]  I'm not adding to it.
[16111.94s -> 16112.98s]  I want a motorcycle though.
[16113.54s -> 16125.48s]  He has a quota.
[16125.48s -> 16126.20s]  No, I'm just saying...
[16126.20s -> 16127.88s]  I just want to go, all right, let's punch this person.
[16127.88s -> 16128.84s]  Let's punch this lady.
[16128.84s -> 16129.64s]  Let's punch this guy.
[16130.28s -> 16141.64s]  Is he a bike?
[16142.28s -> 16150.60s]  I've never seen anyone do the mission like this.
[16150.60s -> 16151.48s]  Did he shoot someone?
[16152.12s -> 16169.73s]  All right, come here.
[16169.73s -> 16172.45s]  It can't be reported stolen if nobody knows it was stolen.
[16172.45s -> 16184.63s]  All right, we're in the clear.
[16195.43s -> 16196.55s]  Bike, bike, bike.
[16196.55s -> 16197.43s]  It's all right, it's okay.
[16197.99s -> 16201.00s]  If you see another one, let me know though.
[16201.32s -> 16232.77s]  Can you get on?
[16232.77s -> 16237.51s]  Oh, he can't.
[16237.51s -> 16239.91s]  Oh my god, Sam, please hurry up.
[16239.91s -> 16242.84s]  That's annoying.
[16242.84s -> 16247.06s]  Really?
[16247.06s -> 16248.02s]  You can't get on the bike.
[16250.47s -> 16257.49s]  You think we're cute?
[16259.01s -> 16259.73s]  Yeah, sure.
[16259.73s -> 16278.12s]  All right, we got no police on us.
[16278.12s -> 16279.16s]  We're good to go.
[16279.16s -> 16281.24s]  Let's go straight on.
[16281.24s -> 16289.68s]  It's time for a pee break, by the way.
[16289.68s -> 16291.49s]  I'm gonna get some water too.
[16291.49s -> 16294.26s]  And think about all the crimes I've committed in this game.
[16303.70s -> 16304.34s]  Update the driver.
[16304.34s -> 16305.62s]  I don't think it's even necessary anymore.
[16317.00s -> 16319.32s]  Yeah, ever since I turned up the graphics, it's been fine.
[16319.32s -> 16322.61s]  All right, let me get some water.
[16323.17s -> 16324.15s]  I'll be back.
[16328.28s -> 16328.92s]  After this cutsie.
[16328.92s -> 16342.84s]  In a fit of paranoid rage, I thought this lady was gonna poison me.
[16342.84s -> 16345.72s]  She just wanted to show me where her friend Michelle was.
[16345.72s -> 16347.48s]  And I punched her in the face eight times.
[16363.78s -> 16365.51s]  It's a strange thing.
[16365.51s -> 16367.19s]  Nothing really came of it all.
[16367.19s -> 16369.67s]  I always figured Celia repaid off someone somewhere,
[16369.67s -> 16371.11s]  because it wasn't even in her papers.
[16371.83s -> 16376.52s]  Which store can you find this game?
[16376.52s -> 16377.02s]  Thanks.
[16378.28s -> 16379.08s]  Uh, Wal-Mart.
[16380.44s -> 16380.94s]  Target.
[16382.12s -> 16382.62s]  Amazon.
[16384.12s -> 16387.56s]  And Frank caught wind that Morello was helping Galati get re-elected,
[16387.56s -> 16389.32s]  hoping he'd go after the Don.
[16389.32s -> 16392.79s]  Well, I covered some account books for Morello's offices.
[16392.79s -> 16395.11s]  Sturdy Tree was a pretty good year for him.
[16395.11s -> 16397.03s]  Best didn't know we were bleeding out before we did.
[16397.59s -> 16401.51s]  While we were busy keeping our heads down, he started moving in on our rackets.
[16401.51s -> 16403.83s]  Quiet at first, a few trucks go missing.
[16403.83s -> 16406.31s]  Uh, Top Burner has one too many high balls, drives off-
[16406.31s -> 16407.83s]  Did anybody in the 30s eat food?
[16409.99s -> 16411.35s]  We haven't seen anybody eat any food.
[16411.35s -> 16414.55s]  We've seen them drink a shitload of coffee and cigarettes.
[16414.55s -> 16416.39s]  I think maybe Polly smelled something.
[16416.39s -> 16419.78s]  Oh, there's a Morello circling.
[16419.78s -> 16420.42s]  No one's eating.
[16420.42s -> 16421.94s]  Who was still making good money.
[16421.94s -> 16424.08s]  And with the Don worried about keeping the heat off,
[16424.80s -> 16425.84s]  we didn't have much to do.
[16426.64s -> 16428.48s]  Except drink, have a few laughs.
[16429.44s -> 16433.72s]  Every time I went into Salieri's, there was Sarah.
[16435.68s -> 16437.04s]  They literally just ordered their food.
[16438.00s -> 16439.44s]  They're not going to eat it on camera though.
[16439.44s -> 16443.08s]  Frank, Galati, the Don's consecutive.
[16443.88s -> 16444.60s]  Yeah, that's right.
[16445.64s -> 16446.52s]  He set me straight.
[16448.55s -> 16449.83s]  He set us all straight.
[16451.94s -> 16454.66s]  There's a lot of buzz around town about you guys.
[16454.66s -> 16456.50s]  Yeah, we got into a little scrap last night.
[16456.50s -> 16457.22s]  It's no big deal.
[16458.10s -> 16459.78s]  I don't care about the bar fight, Tom.
[16460.66s -> 16462.90s]  I care how it looks when you walk into a club
[16462.90s -> 16464.02s]  and buy everyone around.
[16464.74s -> 16466.02s]  We got to do something with our dough.
[16466.90s -> 16468.82s]  Then blow it at the track on Sunday.
[16468.82s -> 16470.10s]  All right, food recommendation time.
[16473.46s -> 16475.38s]  You want me to become one of those Wall Street boys?
[16475.38s -> 16476.66s]  Don't sass me, Tommy.
[16477.99s -> 16479.75s]  I'm trying to teach you the ropes
[16479.75s -> 16481.27s]  so you don't get strangled by them.
[16483.64s -> 16485.16s]  You ever have a dog, Tom?
[16485.16s -> 16485.88s]  Stonks?
[16485.88s -> 16486.38s]  Sure.
[16487.16s -> 16488.52s]  A little mud when I was a kid.
[16488.52s -> 16489.72s]  I don't think I can eat those.
[16489.72s -> 16492.76s]  When I was eight or nine, before I came over from the Ceasley,
[16493.80s -> 16496.36s]  I had this beautiful, skinny Cernico de Letna.
[16497.16s -> 16498.61s]  Like a little gray out.
[16499.65s -> 16501.41s]  Fastest dog you've ever seen.
[16502.29s -> 16503.65s]  That's how I met the Don.
[16504.29s -> 16506.29s]  We started setting up races together.
[16507.09s -> 16509.33s]  Pedding on her with coins and rifle shells.
[16510.61s -> 16512.85s]  There wasn't another dog that could catch her.
[16513.80s -> 16518.36s]  She never lost until the day she did.
[16519.08s -> 16522.55s]  We were only out of pocket knife, but
[16523.51s -> 16525.35s]  I never saw the Don so angry.
[16526.39s -> 16527.83s]  She got old on you?
[16527.83s -> 16528.33s]  No.
[16529.11s -> 16529.61s]  Pregnant.
[16530.63s -> 16532.79s]  She went into heat, got out of the yard,
[16533.84s -> 16536.40s]  and every dog in town had a turn.
[16538.20s -> 16539.64s]  You're like that dog, Tommy.
[16541.17s -> 16543.09s]  Every time you flash your money around,
[16543.09s -> 16544.37s]  you're a bitch in heat,
[16544.37s -> 16546.93s]  and everyone in that club is now looking to fuck you.
[16548.05s -> 16548.61s]  I think there's a
[16549.25s -> 16550.21s]  and once you get fucked
[16550.21s -> 16551.57s]  from where you could describe this to be.
[16552.21s -> 16553.41s]  You're no good to us.
[16553.41s -> 16554.85s]  What the hell are you doing?
[16554.85s -> 16558.12s]  You understand.
[16560.58s -> 16561.38s]  You made your point.
[16562.34s -> 16562.90s]  Good.
[16562.90s -> 16565.88s]  But you need to think about your career here.
[16568.04s -> 16570.13s]  Look, police at his ceiling.
[16570.13s -> 16571.73s]  It's a germatyr analogy.
[16571.73s -> 16573.25s]  He's not smart enough to run anything.
[16574.13s -> 16576.21s]  Sam is loyal, but he has no vision.
[16577.09s -> 16581.83s]  But you, Tommy, you could run this town someday.
[16586.61s -> 16588.93s]  I'm considerably more hateful than mine.
[16589.57s -> 16593.40s]  So what happened to the dog?
[16593.40s -> 16594.68s]  Don't tell me you're like Saturn.
[16595.24s -> 16596.12s]  Out in the atmosphere.
[16596.68s -> 16598.20s]  And me, I'm like Jupiter.
[16598.20s -> 16602.20s]  And the dawn, the dawn is like the galaxy.
[16603.00s -> 16603.80s]  You're not going to be careful.
[16603.80s -> 16605.96s]  You don't go too many revolutions around that sun.
[16605.96s -> 16607.08s]  You can let me off here.
[16608.00s -> 16608.56s]  That would be kind of...
[16608.56s -> 16609.28s]  Yeah, I could see that.
[16609.28s -> 16610.24s]  That's kind of what I would do.
[16613.12s -> 16615.04s]  Give Sarah my best, Tommy.
[16615.04s -> 16619.75s]  Jeremy, you just missed the moral of the whole story.
[16624.44s -> 16628.36s]  Don't show, don't flash around your money
[16628.36s -> 16629.80s]  and don't act like an asshole.
[16629.80s -> 16632.77s]  I think that's pretty much the whole story, right?
[16633.78s -> 16636.42s]  Back then, everything went through Frank.
[16637.14s -> 16640.02s]  The plans, the orders, the money.
[16640.66s -> 16643.62s]  You could get the call day or night.
[16643.62s -> 16650.77s]  Frank says to wait for him in the garage out in the back.
[16652.04s -> 16653.80s]  You got the job, I think.
[16653.80s -> 16654.52s]  Thanks, Luigi.
[16655.81s -> 16656.69s]  Sarah's cooking.
[16656.69s -> 16657.65s]  She's bringing something over.
[16657.65s -> 16659.01s]  Don't put the game on easy.
[16659.97s -> 16660.85s]  She's a good girl.
[16660.85s -> 16661.35s]  Right.
[16661.89s -> 16663.49s]  Pretty good moral of the story, I think.
[16664.21s -> 16666.10s]  All right, where's Frank?
[16666.10s -> 16683.88s]  In the day.
[16683.88s -> 16684.60s]  About to pee?
[16684.60s -> 16685.48s]  Oh, right, it's all right.
[16686.20s -> 16689.20s]  Oh, this has been kind of one big, long cutscene.
[16695.36s -> 16696.88s]  Thanks for waiting, Tom.
[16696.88s -> 16699.76s]  The Don and I had to go over last month's numbers again.
[16699.76s -> 16700.48s]  Sure.
[16700.48s -> 16701.20s]  So what's the job?
[16701.84s -> 16704.24s]  I want you to help Sam and Paulie with the shipment
[16704.24s -> 16705.84s]  we've got coming in tonight.
[16705.84s -> 16706.72s]  The good stuff?
[16706.72s -> 16707.68s]  Straight from Canada.
[16708.80s -> 16709.84s]  Where do you need me?
[16709.84s -> 16711.68s]  Sam's going to meet our friends from the north
[16711.68s -> 16712.96s]  at the farm outside of town.
[16713.76s -> 16715.04s]  Paulie will oversee the trucks
[16715.04s -> 16716.72s]  bringing the shipment into the city.
[16716.72s -> 16719.60s]  But I want you to go with him.
[16719.60s -> 16721.36s]  Oh, shit, this isn't an open world game.
[16721.36s -> 16723.36s]  Make sure it all goes smoothly.
[16723.44s -> 16723.94s]  Okay.
[16724.56s -> 16725.84s]  Get the car from Ralphie.
[16725.84s -> 16727.12s]  Meet Paulie at the warehouse.
[16727.68s -> 16728.64s]  What does it feel like it is?
[16728.64s -> 16729.84s]  In case you run into any trouble.
[16730.40s -> 16731.12s]  Sure, Frank.
[16731.12s -> 16732.00s]  No problem.
[16732.00s -> 16732.56s]  Good.
[16732.56s -> 16736.08s]  Now bring the Canadian home safe, Tommy.
[16736.96s -> 16739.44s]  There is already a case you're marked for the Don.
[16740.32s -> 16748.40s]  You can do free roaming?
[16748.96s -> 16750.92s]  All right, let's go.
[16751.72s -> 16753.08s]  All right, it's not let's pee.
[16753.08s -> 16754.04s]  We'll be back in like two minutes.
[16754.60s -> 16755.24s]  Beer B?
[16755.24s -> 16897.03s]  Okay, hello.
[16897.03s -> 16908.47s]  The order is yours if you want it, Tommy.
[16908.47s -> 16908.71s]  Thanks.
[16908.71s -> 16909.19s]  Going in.
[16910.90s -> 16911.54s]  Welcome back.
[16912.50s -> 16916.36s]  All right, I was looking at chat.
[16932.26s -> 16933.62s]  Drive to Sellier's warehouse.
[16933.62s -> 16934.82s]  All right, let's move on.
[16936.15s -> 16937.03s]  Drivers, I don't need them.
[16937.03s -> 16937.27s]  I'm good.
[16938.15s -> 16948.26s]  I need to make a turn here.
[16951.32s -> 16952.20s]  Holy shit.
[16952.20s -> 16953.24s]  I am intact.
[16953.24s -> 16953.74s]  Cool.
[16954.20s -> 16972.07s]  I'm not going to lead the cops to the job.
[16972.71s -> 16975.65s]  There's a guy on foot chasing me.
[16975.65s -> 16975.97s]  That's it.
[16975.97s -> 16976.45s]  I'm going to be fine.
[16981.75s -> 16982.23s]  Through here.
[16984.61s -> 16985.11s]  Mm-hmm.
[16985.57s -> 16988.10s]  Let's drive.
[16988.10s -> 16988.74s]  Yeah, I'm going.
[16993.40s -> 16994.52s]  Shit, that's a lot of noise.
[16995.08s -> 17005.38s]  Just hang out for a sec.
[17007.35s -> 17009.19s]  Drive slowly to the next checkpoint.
[17009.19s -> 17009.83s]  We're good to go.
[17014.48s -> 17015.68s]  Hop right in front of me.
[17015.68s -> 17023.72s]  All right, we're good.
[17028.76s -> 17030.28s]  I want to drive a motorcycle around.
[17038.53s -> 17039.73s]  Ask and you shall receive.
[17049.49s -> 17050.53s]  He hates the game.
[17052.36s -> 17053.48s]  We're getting that idea.
[17059.40s -> 17061.88s]  All right, now this is very slippery, but it's pretty cool.
[17062.44s -> 17063.16s]  I do wheelie.
[17063.88s -> 17067.03s]  I can ride like Batman.
[17067.03s -> 17067.43s]  That's cool.
[17072.18s -> 17075.16s]  And three, two, one.
[17075.16s -> 17076.68s]  Fly over the handlebars.
[17076.68s -> 17090.10s]  Oh no, it's the concussion sound again.
[17097.03s -> 17097.53s]  Fuck you.
[17098.47s -> 17110.98s]  Can't jump over that.
[17110.98s -> 17123.68s]  Can you see me?
[17123.68s -> 17133.22s]  Okay, now what?
[17133.22s -> 17136.36s]  Is he going to arrest me?
[17136.36s -> 17139.28s]  He's looking for me.
[17139.28s -> 17174.74s]  Wait, what was that sound?
[17175.70s -> 17178.74s]  I heard a vooga and then it exploded.
[17179.54s -> 17186.36s]  Okay, which way do I need to go?
[17186.36s -> 17187.16s]  Back to the bike.
[17187.16s -> 17188.52s]  The bike is right here.
[17209.06s -> 17211.28s]  How did I do that?
[17211.28s -> 17214.56s]  I don't because I was driving too fast with the motorcycle.
[17214.56s -> 17216.56s]  I crashed into somebody and then the guy chased me into the bush
[17216.56s -> 17218.16s]  and then I got shot by five cops.
[17218.16s -> 17231.16s]  Do I actually?
[17231.16s -> 17232.20s]  Okay, I'm not fucking around.
[17233.70s -> 17234.58s]  Get me the fuck out of this.
[17235.30s -> 17236.02s]  Who cares about the bike?
[17236.02s -> 17236.98s]  The bike is stupid.
[17236.98s -> 17238.10s]  You just crash and die.
[17238.82s -> 17246.36s]  The motorcycle doesn't go faster or anything.
[17246.36s -> 17248.82s]  It's just more vulnerable.
[17261.35s -> 17262.23s]  But it looks cool.
[17262.23s -> 17262.55s]  It does.
[17262.55s -> 17263.05s]  You're right.
[17271.04s -> 17272.72s]  Okay, and back to fast.
[17273.44s -> 17296.36s]  This guy's just in the way.
[17297.08s -> 17298.55s]  All right, no cops.
[17299.11s -> 17314.34s]  We're good.
[17314.34s -> 17327.20s]  Um, somebody said look at that link.
[17327.20s -> 17327.70s]  Hold on.
[17332.61s -> 17334.69s]  Is that the water doing that or is it me being an idiot?
[17335.41s -> 17338.84s]  Cops.
[17343.27s -> 17344.63s]  Why is everybody standing over here?
[17351.38s -> 17353.62s]  Because I looked back at the car accident?
[17354.26s -> 17354.76s]  What?
[17361.97s -> 17363.17s]  You nearly hit a guy.
[17363.17s -> 17363.81s]  I did not.
[17364.53s -> 17374.26s]  We're safe down here.
[17374.26s -> 17393.72s]  Okay, we're good.
[17393.72s -> 17395.96s]  Uh, he's coming back this way.
[17396.60s -> 17409.03s]  Oh shit, it's this dock.
[17409.03s -> 17410.07s]  I gotta go over the bridge.
[17419.08s -> 17421.72s]  No, did I just get the cops called on me again?
[17433.00s -> 17434.76s]  Because I fucking beeped at her.
[17435.40s -> 17441.33s]  Just take the ticket out.
[17441.33s -> 17444.29s]  No, but yeah, I mean there's no in-game currency.
[17445.54s -> 17446.66s]  That doesn't really do anything.
[17446.66s -> 17447.46s]  It's not a problem.
[17448.18s -> 17450.64s]  I don't think it takes money out of your account in the game.
[17451.28s -> 17453.28s]  All right, I'll just go turn myself in right here, right?
[17454.08s -> 17455.28s]  There's like three cops here.
[17455.28s -> 17456.40s]  Here, I will pay.
[17458.20s -> 17458.84s]  I will pay.
[17459.72s -> 17465.48s]  I will pay.
[17469.08s -> 17471.88s]  I'm paying my Skyrim debt.
[17471.88s -> 17477.70s]  What just happened?
[17493.73s -> 17495.57s]  Okay, we're good.
[17496.21s -> 17504.34s]  Don't tell me I could get you in trouble for that.
[17504.98s -> 17513.20s]  Oh, and uh, officers, excuse me.
[17513.20s -> 17516.64s]  Actually, were you just beeping at a pedestrian in the crosswalk?
[17516.64s -> 17518.48s]  I was crossing the road and you beeped at me.
[17519.36s -> 17522.26s]  I thought you both arrest yourselves.
[17523.06s -> 17530.40s]  Was I a pedestrian in the road and did you beep at me and scare me?
[17531.12s -> 17535.97s]  Why are they speed matching me?
[17535.97s -> 17536.53s]  I don't like this.
[17576.42s -> 17576.98s]  Seriously.
[17577.62s -> 17579.22s]  Oh, I can't play these games.
[17579.22s -> 17580.50s]  I like, I just can't.
[17580.50s -> 17582.42s]  My attention is so bad.
[17582.42s -> 17585.06s]  Like I look at chat and just read what you guys are saying.
[17585.06s -> 17586.47s]  I'm gonna straight away.
[17586.47s -> 17589.43s]  It's just like, I'm just, I'm looking over and just, oh, hey, hi guys.
[17590.96s -> 17592.40s]  Oh, fucking God.
[17592.40s -> 17593.84s]  Just get there for the love of God.
[17594.48s -> 17607.33s]  Holy shit, man.
[17607.33s -> 17607.73s]  Okay.
[17609.33s -> 17611.89s]  It's not Grand Theft Auto.
[17611.89s -> 17616.92s]  It's not GTA.
[17616.92s -> 17619.80s]  Stop playing the game like it's GTA.
[17621.12s -> 17625.52s]  You can't just like smash into stuff and just drive over people and drive into things.
[17626.56s -> 17627.28s]  There are rules.
[17627.28s -> 17628.48s]  There are laws in this game.
[17642.13s -> 17642.85s]  Lighting is pretty good.
[17642.85s -> 17643.33s]  Yeah, it is.
[17643.33s -> 17647.60s]  I mean, the game looks great.
[17647.60s -> 17649.04s]  It really does.
[17660.39s -> 17674.15s]  Ride the bank.
[17676.85s -> 17677.17s]  Okay.
[17677.17s -> 17678.13s]  Here we are.
[17678.13s -> 17679.25s]  Same exact spot.
[17704.64s -> 17706.16s]  Graphics are pretty good for the 1930s.
[17706.16s -> 17706.56s]  Yeah, they are.
[17706.56s -> 17718.69s]  This game is ridiculous.
[17732.82s -> 17733.86s]  Illegal speeder.
[17743.24s -> 17745.40s]  Sharing the road with this thing would be so hard.
[17748.71s -> 17750.71s]  I'm glad I don't live in a city that has one of those.
[17750.71s -> 17751.59s]  That would freak me out.
[17763.28s -> 17764.88s]  Normal driving RP or riot.
[17764.88s -> 17765.12s]  Fine.
[17775.08s -> 17775.88s]  Raining out today.
[17782.69s -> 17791.09s]  I thought I was going to break.
[17795.03s -> 17797.27s]  I thought I was going to crash through it.
[17797.27s -> 17798.23s]  Joke ruined.
[17798.23s -> 17798.63s]  Oh, well.
[17799.43s -> 17818.00s]  What is this place?
[17818.00s -> 17819.28s]  This place is across the whole game.
[17819.92s -> 17832.08s]  All right.
[17832.08s -> 17832.88s]  Take off the limiter.
[17834.24s -> 17835.84s]  Overclock the car, please.
[17848.92s -> 17849.16s]  All right.
[17849.16s -> 17850.28s]  Now it's back on.
[17850.28s -> 17856.42s]  When you get a straightaway like that, you got to go for it.
[17856.42s -> 17857.54s]  If there's no cops around, you're fine.
[17858.18s -> 17864.10s]  In front of that car, it looked like it was made of tin foil.
[17875.83s -> 17877.73s]  You know this place?
[17877.73s -> 17878.21s]  Oh, yeah.
[17879.17s -> 17881.09s]  We've done a few pickups at the farm before.
[17881.81s -> 17882.37s]  Don't worry.
[17883.09s -> 17885.97s]  There ain't nothing but cow shit and shine out here.
[17886.93s -> 17888.77s]  It's going to be an easy few clams.
[17889.89s -> 17893.33s]  We'll load up the trucks, we'll come straight back.
[17893.33s -> 17894.61s]  Yeah, let's make it quick.
[17894.61s -> 17895.65s]  I got someplace to be.
[17896.45s -> 17897.89s]  The skin is really good in this game.
[17899.33s -> 17902.37s]  You can see like all the random little splotchies.
[17905.08s -> 17906.04s]  How do you even do that?
[17906.28s -> 17909.48s]  Detecting the girl's virginity one day and taking it to the next.
[17909.48s -> 17911.80s]  How do you do next day after a shave looking?
[17911.80s -> 17912.28s]  Come on.
[17912.28s -> 17913.24s]  It's crazy.
[17913.24s -> 17914.12s]  I'm just kidding.
[17915.08s -> 17915.96s]  She's a good girl.
[17917.09s -> 17920.77s]  You settle down, she'll straighten you right out.
[17920.77s -> 17925.17s]  You're going home to a couch.
[17925.73s -> 17926.29s]  Yeah, the bumps.
[17926.29s -> 17927.25s]  The bumps look really good.
[17928.21s -> 17931.25s]  Now I wonder what kind of story she could tell about her old man though.
[17931.97s -> 17934.69s]  Cold killer back in the day.
[17934.69s -> 17935.89s]  Where are we driving?
[17935.89s -> 17938.05s]  Are we driving off the road?
[17938.05s -> 17938.61s]  Where are we?
[17939.33s -> 17941.94s]  You know, she's been helping out behind a bar
[17941.94s -> 17942.98s]  since she was a kid.
[17942.98s -> 17944.34s]  We're driving under water?
[17945.06s -> 17946.98s]  I bet she's seen and heard a few things.
[17947.78s -> 17950.55s]  Probably knows more about our business than we do.
[17951.35s -> 17952.23s]  She knows enough.
[17952.23s -> 17953.03s]  Where's this car?
[17953.03s -> 17954.31s]  How many questions?
[17954.31s -> 17956.56s]  That's good.
[17956.56s -> 17959.16s]  She won't ever make a liar out of you.
[17959.16s -> 17960.98s]  Christ.
[17961.68s -> 17963.99s]  Go to Mario just for that.
[17967.43s -> 17969.19s]  Watching a movie would be hell with you.
[17969.19s -> 17969.75s]  Damn it.
[17969.75s -> 17971.51s]  No, no, I put tape over my mouth.
[17971.51s -> 17973.51s]  Sam should be waiting here but I don't see him.
[17974.93s -> 17976.61s]  Something smells off.
[17976.61s -> 17978.96s]  Don't let your pecker get all shriveled up.
[17979.60s -> 17981.72s]  Probably just trying to get out of the rain.
[17981.72s -> 17982.52s]  The only thing you hear is
[17990.08s -> 17991.68s]  So if you turn the volume up loud enough
[17991.68s -> 17993.28s]  to like maybe seven or eight on your TV
[17993.28s -> 17994.00s]  you won't even hear that.
[17996.82s -> 18000.23s]  Okay, let's go find him.
[18000.23s -> 18004.81s]  Bastard.
[18005.59s -> 18007.43s]  It's just three sheets
[18007.43s -> 18009.27s]  and I'm wrecking a new suit for nothing.
[18010.15s -> 18011.43s]  I swear I'm gonna kill him.
[18013.22s -> 18013.72s]  Here.
[18014.10s -> 18016.29s]  Just in case Frank was right.
[18017.09s -> 18019.84s]  I'm gonna go grab them boys.
[18019.84s -> 18020.80s]  Get them sorted out.
[18021.44s -> 18023.28s]  You go ahead see what's what.
[18023.36s -> 18024.40s]  We'll catch up with you.
[18024.40s -> 18024.90s]  Jot gun.
[18025.84s -> 18034.13s]  Search for clues.
[18039.51s -> 18040.87s]  So the last mission was hit man.
[18040.87s -> 18042.23s]  Now this is like a detective game.
[18042.79s -> 18043.91s]  This game is everything, huh?
[18046.24s -> 18047.60s]  One quarter out of work.
[18050.45s -> 18051.57s]  Find Sam.
[18051.57s -> 18060.10s]  I'll be sneaking around.
[18060.66s -> 18069.67s]  Somebody here.
[18069.67s -> 18072.79s]  What is this?
[18072.79s -> 18075.20s]  A little target.
[18075.20s -> 18075.70s]  Oh.
[18076.96s -> 18078.08s]  Arlo Falcone.
[18078.72s -> 18080.63s]  Oh, it's a collectible card.
[18080.63s -> 18081.13s]  Okay, cool.
[18086.53s -> 18088.05s]  Investigate the truck.
[18088.05s -> 18093.89s]  Somebody in there.
[18093.89s -> 18094.53s]  Are they sleeping?
[18102.87s -> 18103.37s]  Hey buddy.
[18105.03s -> 18106.86s]  He's dead.
[18108.96s -> 18109.76s]  Jesus.
[18109.76s -> 18111.52s]  Drop your weapon.
[18111.52s -> 18112.16s]  You first.
[18112.72s -> 18114.08s]  We don't have time for this.
[18114.08s -> 18114.96s]  Sorry pal.
[18114.96s -> 18116.56s]  Guess we're doing this the hard way.
[18117.76s -> 18118.32s]  Okay then.
[18119.68s -> 18122.63s]  All right well he got one for me.
[18122.63s -> 18123.35s]  I didn't even have to aim.
[18123.35s -> 18123.85s]  I'm glad.
[18124.63s -> 18138.88s]  Into the house.
[18138.88s -> 18149.54s]  I shot the two glass bottles.
[18149.54s -> 18150.58s]  More than I could shoot the guy.
[18151.22s -> 18153.09s]  I'm getting collapsed on.
[18153.09s -> 18166.93s]  Oh come on.
[18166.93s -> 18168.21s]  I shot three times.
[18168.21s -> 18169.17s]  Right in the chest.
[18169.17s -> 18176.28s]  Put up the keyboard.
[18176.28s -> 18186.18s]  All right keyboard time.
[18186.18s -> 18202.47s]  Keyboard mode.
[18202.47s -> 18203.11s]  Yep.
[18203.11s -> 18205.41s]  Doesn't really help now does it?
[18223.62s -> 18224.12s]  Okay.
[18224.20s -> 18231.26s]  Is there ammo in here?
[18231.26s -> 18232.06s]  Yes there is.
[18233.62s -> 18234.66s]  Meet at the usual place.
[18234.66s -> 18235.38s]  Whatever that means.
[18243.21s -> 18244.65s]  It's a Wiimote?
[18244.65s -> 18245.93s]  Use a Wiimote.
[18245.93s -> 18247.61s]  You know I wish I could.
[18247.61s -> 18255.99s]  When I play games sometimes I go damn.
[18255.99s -> 18257.19s]  This would be so much better with a Wiimote.
[18269.96s -> 18270.92s]  Use a VR headset.
[18270.92s -> 18272.12s]  Hey glad you brought that up.
[18272.84s -> 18273.34s]  Tomorrow.
[18274.74s -> 18275.62s]  Going back to VR.
[18276.18s -> 18278.71s]  I'm gonna play multiplayer VR.
[18279.93s -> 18280.49s]  With some friends.
[18291.16s -> 18293.64s]  I leaked it already but I'm not gonna leak it anymore.
[18298.86s -> 18300.70s]  That's not gonna happen till late tomorrow night.
[18301.26s -> 18301.82s]  Very late.
[18303.99s -> 18307.83s]  8 am pacific is when that stream is gonna be a late one tomorrow.
[18332.92s -> 18334.04s]  All right let's go find Sam.
[18339.08s -> 18342.39s]  How much ammo?
[18342.39s -> 18343.35s]  Nah I'll keep the shotgun.
[18344.15s -> 18346.87s]  Any more ammo though?
[18346.87s -> 18348.23s]  I want a bunch of ammo for the shotgun.
[18348.87s -> 18353.24s]  Here we go.
[18354.74s -> 18356.02s]  Okay now I feel confident.
[18356.58s -> 18362.87s]  East coast?
[18362.87s -> 18364.95s]  Yeah that's gonna be 11 pm start east coast.
[18364.95s -> 18365.43s]  It's late.
[18366.15s -> 18369.67s]  The latest stream I've done in probably a year or two.
[18370.31s -> 18376.33s]  Should be a lot of fun though.
[18376.33s -> 18380.17s]  And that starts the beginning of a lot of VR.
[18381.40s -> 18383.08s]  FTK obviously is gonna be this weekend.
[18384.10s -> 18386.98s]  And tomorrow I'm gonna start the stream a little early tomorrow.
[18388.92s -> 18392.28s]  Yes so I can get VR set up and we're gonna talk about FTK.
[18393.08s -> 18397.94s]  Yes a little bit maybe like before maybe 20 minutes before everyone kind of shows up.
[18399.22s -> 18404.31s]  Because that's happening this weekend.
[18404.31s -> 18409.86s]  So holotov's over here for what?
[18413.96s -> 18416.10s]  Oh shit what the hell is this?
[18425.46s -> 18426.66s]  End of the stream voice?
[18426.66s -> 18427.38s]  Yeah probably.
[18431.35s -> 18432.47s]  Yeah probably.
[18432.47s -> 18433.43s]  It's getting to be that point.
[18433.99s -> 18438.79s]  I'll be back tomorrow though.
[18438.79s -> 18441.38s]  Tomorrow's gonna be high energy.
[18441.38s -> 18442.34s]  It's gonna be in VR.
[18443.06s -> 18444.87s]  Is that a bad guy?
[18444.87s -> 18445.27s]  Oh no.
[18449.50s -> 18450.94s]  Today was pretty high energy too.
[18450.94s -> 18452.62s]  The last few streams have been pretty high energy.
[18453.74s -> 18454.46s]  High energy?
[18454.46s -> 18455.58s]  Why can I not say that together?
[18456.14s -> 18463.50s]  Pretty much always high energy.
[18464.06s -> 18466.28s]  The only time I'm not high energy.
[18467.48s -> 18470.52s]  I think we found him.
[18471.94s -> 18473.46s]  All right we got him.
[18473.46s -> 18475.06s]  We found the bad guys.
[18480.76s -> 18482.04s]  Throw Molotov in here?
[18482.60s -> 18483.96s]  All right I'm gonna throw Molotov in there.
[18487.86s -> 18488.58s]  Nobody in here.
[18495.80s -> 18496.52s]  All right I got the back.
[18500.60s -> 18508.92s]  He's never gonna finish this game?
[18508.92s -> 18511.48s]  Um I don't know.
[18511.48s -> 18511.96s]  I might.
[18513.05s -> 18516.33s]  Once VR is set up it's not being teared down for a while.
[18516.33s -> 18519.05s]  I've got like a dozen VR games I have to play while that's set up.
[18528.60s -> 18528.92s]  He won't.
[18528.92s -> 18529.32s]  He won't.
[18529.32s -> 18529.80s]  He won't.
[18529.80s -> 18532.36s]  Yeah I you know let's just say I won't.
[18532.36s -> 18533.00s]  What?
[18533.00s -> 18534.66s]  That doesn't mean I'm not having fun.
[18535.30s -> 18540.87s]  Is that?
[18541.59s -> 18544.47s]  Oh shit that was I think that was one of our friends.
[18545.19s -> 18562.54s]  Well there he is.
[18562.54s -> 18564.60s]  Is he dead?
[18565.16s -> 18573.54s]  Gamer mode come on.
[18573.54s -> 18588.38s]  That guy's still on fire.
[18588.38s -> 18593.16s]  That's not a red barrel.
[18611.90s -> 18613.02s]  You guys can you just shoot him?
[18616.18s -> 18632.66s]  Get it off!
[18632.66s -> 18634.58s]  That lightning just distracted me.
[18639.96s -> 18643.08s]  Shoot him shoot him shoot him shoot him shoot him shoot him shoot him shoot him shoot this guy.
[18643.88s -> 18652.06s]  I'm fine.
[18652.06s -> 18658.90s]  What a grenade grenade grenade grenade grenade grenade grenade grenade.
[18666.25s -> 18667.13s]  I need another gun.
[18668.70s -> 18669.58s]  Did I pick up grenades?
[18670.89s -> 18673.64s]  No I didn't.
[18673.64s -> 18679.75s]  Shit okay I'm gonna go for it in one two press the wrong button.
[18680.47s -> 18693.48s]  You shoot me through the wood?
[18695.06s -> 18696.26s]  All right now I'm not gonna fuck around.
[18696.26s -> 18697.46s]  I'm just I'm not gonna fuck around.
[18697.46s -> 18698.18s]  Let's go.
[18698.18s -> 18706.44s]  Are you gonna call me a dead prick?
[18737.83s -> 18739.03s]  What aim?
[18739.03s -> 18741.11s]  The aim is unbelievable.
[18742.07s -> 18751.45s]  That landed right at my feet.
[18751.45s -> 18756.04s]  This is on easy?
[18756.04s -> 18758.92s]  No this is on like the realism game mode for some reason.
[18759.48s -> 18780.54s]  It's only easy when I want it to be.
[18780.54s -> 18781.10s]  Yeah that's right.
[18781.66s -> 18801.98s]  Where are you?
[18801.98s -> 18810.89s]  This is aiming oh okay.
[18811.53s -> 18831.77s]  Oh my god he's made it out of metal.
[18842.44s -> 18843.24s]  Chubby bunny.
[18853.42s -> 18855.90s]  I'm just gonna look like I had wisdom teeth surgery.
[18856.70s -> 18869.77s]  I should put him in.
[18870.41s -> 18871.45s]  Put a bunch of gauze.
[18873.42s -> 18874.22s]  Around my mouth.
[18878.58s -> 18881.78s]  Just kind of lean back and be like I just had true surgery.
[18906.28s -> 18907.72s]  You chubby bunny I will sub.
[18909.43s -> 18911.27s]  Welcome our newest subscriber next week.

[18934.54s -> 18935.50s]  In quotes.

[18966.06s -> 18991.16s]  Ow!
[18991.16s -> 19000.22s]  Can you move over the other way man?
[19000.22s -> 19013.29s]  Like can you just throw a molotov on keyboard?
[19014.70s -> 19021.27s]  T-R-Y-A-X-G?
[19021.83s -> 19029.90s]  I feel like I'm just playing Left 4 Dead.
[19031.99s -> 19044.58s]  Another game this game is.
[19044.58s -> 19045.54s]  Where are you?
[19045.62s -> 19047.48s]  Up the stairs.

[19086.14s -> 19087.74s]  Oh come on really man?
[19091.56s -> 19096.92s]  That was just somebody went into gmod and moved that face around.
[19096.92s -> 19098.12s]  That wasn't even me doing that.
[19098.76s -> 19106.52s]  I'm just gonna sit right here.
[19107.00s -> 19113.40s]  There you go.
[19113.40s -> 19115.96s]  Oh holy shit that guy's climbing the wall.

[19471.91s -> 19473.27s]  I'm fairly clean right now.
[19480.82s -> 19482.66s]  I took a shower like six hours ago.
[19482.66s -> 19483.22s]  Seven hours ago.
[19483.22s -> 19483.72s]  I'm fine.
[19493.91s -> 19503.85s]  Okay we got more company.
[19503.85s -> 19504.49s]  Of course we do.
[19515.18s -> 19516.62s]  Jax mode three all right.
[19517.42s -> 19530.18s]  You wash behind your ears.
[19530.90s -> 19531.54s]  Yes.
[19531.54s -> 19537.46s]  When I shampoo I go behind both ears.
[19542.31s -> 19550.81s]  Like I did?
[19550.81s -> 19554.52s]  Is this car driving itself?
[19564.63s -> 19565.59s]  Here comes the armored truck.
[19566.31s -> 19570.84s]  I think that was just a guy on a motorcycle.
[19570.84s -> 19571.72s]  I don't think that was even a cop.
[19572.36s -> 19579.56s]  Tesla?
[19580.20s -> 19581.00s]  Tesla car?
[19588.39s -> 19589.99s]  You clean your...

[19592.95s -> 19596.87s]  I got him.
[19608.58s -> 19610.10s]  I don't know why I just read this.
[19610.10s -> 19612.50s]  I think I thought somebody just said centrist truck.
[19613.66s -> 19615.74s]  Like how what does it even mean?
[19616.70s -> 19631.50s]  Come on get the driver.
[19639.93s -> 19640.97s]  Driver driver get the driver.
[19643.64s -> 19644.14s]  What?
[19665.45s -> 19673.53s]  Okay it's all my the truck's already dead.
[19684.18s -> 19685.86s]  You died to centrist wheel.
[19695.62s -> 19696.66s]  Um where are they?
[19705.48s -> 19707.48s]  One down and there's one down.
[19708.04s -> 19709.32s]  The truck is about to explode.
[19711.48s -> 19712.60s]  Oh we're good.
[19712.60s -> 19725.40s]  Going to clear?
[19735.64s -> 19736.44s]  More.
[19736.44s -> 19750.95s]  That guy thinks he's he-man right now.
[19750.95s -> 19753.11s]  That cop couldn't even believe it himself.
[19753.11s -> 19760.81s]  Am I soft-locked?
[19775.16s -> 19780.54s]  Come on.
[19780.54s -> 19785.58s]  Did I not kill the guy behind there?
[19790.31s -> 19790.87s]  He's still there.
[19791.59s -> 19811.67s]  I think we're good.
[19815.22s -> 19818.74s]  No apparently not.
[19818.74s -> 19819.54s]  There's another one.
[19820.26s -> 19827.26s]  Okay armored truck versus bread van.
[19832.66s -> 19833.94s]  I wonder which one's gonna win.
[19834.42s -> 19845.99s]  Dude it's tires.
[19845.99s -> 19854.55s]  Shoot the gun.
[19858.14s -> 19859.02s]  It wants me to shoot the gun.
[19859.02s -> 19870.07s]  It kind of sounds like Barry from American Dad.
[19870.07s -> 19885.18s]  Steve's friend.
[19885.18s -> 19886.06s]  Holy shit.
[19891.61s -> 19894.78s]  Okay shoot just duck.
[19894.78s -> 19896.06s]  When they reload shoot it a little bit.
[19896.06s -> 19897.34s]  Duck shoot a little bit.
[19897.34s -> 19898.94s]  Duck shoot a little bit in the gun.
[19898.94s -> 19899.66s]  I know I know.
[19899.66s -> 19919.90s]  That's what I'm gonna get it.
[19919.90s -> 19942.84s]  Shoot the gun.
[19942.84s -> 19943.40s]  I know.
[19951.45s -> 19953.61s]  God take out the what?
[19953.61s -> 19954.57s]  The windshield?
[19962.22s -> 19964.62s]  Oh my god this is gonna be so hard to shoot the lights out.
[19965.34s -> 19971.61s]  Did I get it?
[19971.61s -> 19972.33s]  Yes.
[19972.33s -> 19978.30s]  Tommy take out the trash.
[19978.30s -> 19979.58s]  The trash?
[19979.58s -> 19980.54s]  Why are you saying it like that?
[19981.26s -> 19991.34s]  I just dropped him.
[19991.34s -> 19994.22s]  I'm playing like Blinko on the Price is Right.
[19994.22s -> 19995.02s]  I'm not even aiming.
[20001.45s -> 20010.06s]  This mission is really long.
[20010.06s -> 20010.78s]  Holy shit.
[20023.86s -> 20025.22s]  I feel like this guy would be dead by now.
[20055.06s -> 20056.74s]  Toilet bowl gaming five community subs.
[20056.74s -> 20057.38s]  Thanks a lot dude.
[20064.01s -> 20064.89s]  That's a pretty cool name.
[20069.08s -> 20075.91s]  I like that name.
[20075.91s -> 20076.31s]  I really do.
[20094.76s -> 20095.24s]  You didn't?
[20096.28s -> 20098.76s]  I did everything.
[20099.40s -> 20114.28s]  I want like five grand or I'm walking.
[20114.92s -> 20118.22s]  That was a five grand kind of play there.
[20122.38s -> 20122.78s]  All right.
[20123.58s -> 20127.54s]  That is where I'm going to end the stream tonight.
[20127.54s -> 20128.58s]  Thanks for watching everybody.
[20129.22s -> 20132.02s]  I will see you tomorrow for VR.
[20132.58s -> 20134.60s]  I think that's a good stopping point.

[20138.98s -> 20139.94s]  Sorry I punched that lady.
[20139.94s -> 20141.14s]  Sorry I shot that guy.
[20141.14s -> 20142.26s]  Sorry I strangled that guy.
[20142.26s -> 20143.22s]  Sorry I strangled the other guy.
[20143.22s -> 20144.18s]  Sorry I shot that other guy.
[20144.18s -> 20146.42s]  Sorry I ran that whole bunch of people over.
[20146.42s -> 20147.94s]  Please forgive me.
[20148.50s -> 20155.64s]  Actually kind of a big map.
[20155.64s -> 20156.68s]  No not forgiven.
[20158.25s -> 20159.77s]  I also blew up the clown too.
[20159.77s -> 20161.13s]  Oh well I didn't actually do that.
[20161.69s -> 20162.57s]  I think he was still alive.
[20166.63s -> 20167.59s]  Thank you everybody.
[20167.59s -> 20168.31s]  We'll see you soon.
[20169.03s -> 20172.12s]  Tomorrow at 8 p.m. Pacific.
[20172.12s -> 20173.85s]  I'm going to be playing VR.
[20174.41s -> 20176.86s]  I'm going to be setting it up and doing that all over again.
[20177.58s -> 20180.01s]  Half-Life Alex will be shortly after that.
[20180.57s -> 20181.53s]  Probably next week.
[20182.09s -> 20194.42s]  And after that maybe I will come back.
[20194.42s -> 20196.58s]  At this point probably like another six to seven hours left in the game.
[20197.22s -> 20199.06s]  Maybe one more full stream of this game.
[20199.06s -> 20200.42s]  Maybe.
[20200.42s -> 20201.46s]  It depends.
[20201.46s -> 20205.34s]  I'm looking forward to Half-Life Alex.
[20205.90s -> 20208.14s]  It'll be a lot of fun.
[20208.14s -> 20208.86s]  But thank you everybody.
[20208.86s -> 20209.42s]  Thanks all the subs.
[20209.42s -> 20211.34s]  There was a lot of gifted subs today.

[20231.53s -> 20234.68s]  So I...
[20234.68s -> 20236.20s]  Where am I going to put you guys today?
[20236.20s -> 20236.84s]  Let's see.
[20236.84s -> 20238.20s]  Let me see who's live.
[20238.20s -> 20241.53s]  Let me see.
[20241.53s -> 20242.81s]  Who do I want to raid today?
[20246.09s -> 20247.45s]  Raid Mr. Slime.
[20256.25s -> 20257.37s]  Raid the debate.
[20257.37s -> 20258.97s]  No I'm not doing that.
[20258.97s -> 20263.29s]  Critical is critical.
[20263.29s -> 20264.57s]  Yeah critical is online right?
[20264.57s -> 20266.22s]  What's critical doing?
[20266.22s -> 20277.27s]  Raid the debate.
[20277.27s -> 20278.71s]  I'm not going to raid the debate.
[20278.71s -> 20280.71s]  That's a mistake.
[20281.43s -> 20287.93s]  What's critical doing right now?
[20290.52s -> 20291.16s]  Oh shit.

[20307.32s -> 20310.44s]  Which is exactly what we're going to play tomorrow.
[20310.44s -> 20317.67s]  And when I say we I mean some mystery streamers.
