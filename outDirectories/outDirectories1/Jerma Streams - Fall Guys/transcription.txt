[0.12s -> 16.65s]  I'm gonna go to the official Fall Guys Twitter, and we'll see. We'll see. Okay, it is...
[28.41s -> 34.46s]  Stop, stop it! People are playing it. All right, let me, let me just open it. Let me see what happens.
[35.10s -> 40.09s]  There's other people streaming it right now. Oh shit, really? Okay, let's try.
[40.09s -> 60.65s]  And turn off, turn off like the fucking fantasy music. All right, I'm giving this a shot.
[60.65s -> 72.86s]  Got him again. I don't think you got me again. All right, pull it up. There it is.
[76.86s -> 95.05s]  All right, come on. Let's go. Come on.
[110.84s -> 120.70s]  All right, how do you play? Navigate the obstacles and race to the finish line.
[120.70s -> 137.88s]  Okay. Oh shit. Okay, navigate the obstacles and get to the finish line. Is there a jump? Which one am I?
[138.44s -> 148.33s]  Okay, there's a jump. There's a dive. These are all other players, right?
[149.29s -> 153.69s]  Oh, you all just got instantly eliminated by the fucking Mario thing from Bowser's Castle.
[153.69s -> 160.39s]  I've been playing games for 10, 100 years. Who's... I'm getting like notifications on my phone.
[163.90s -> 179.02s]  How do I do this? Is it a bouncy? Oh shit. All right, I'm in like, I'm in like 14th place.
[179.74s -> 199.90s]  What happened? This is the risky way. You gotta go the risky way. Good. I'm okay. What was that?
[199.90s -> 216.23s]  What was that? Is it like, is it like drifting behind somebody? Oh shit. Fall count one.
[216.23s -> 220.49s]  All right, what place did I make it in? I qualified. I came in 10th place.
[233.14s -> 236.26s]  People just can't get that thing on the ground. All right, I gotta change my,
[236.26s -> 248.58s]  I gotta change my title. I'm finally playing Fall Guys. Finally. Hunting for treasure chests.
[249.30s -> 269.21s]  Whatever. Did I make it? 32 remain. That's me. But Fall Guy 8300. What happens if you qualify?
[269.85s -> 280.25s]  Wait, you could be a soda can? How do you get these new things? Memorize the icons on the tiles.
[280.25s -> 283.45s]  When an icon is displayed on the screen. I didn't get that all of that. What does it say?
[284.33s -> 296.89s]  Match the icon on the screen to avoid the slime. Match the icons?
[301.30s -> 306.10s]  And nine. All right, so it's cherries and grapes. And so I've got to stand on whatever's on the
[306.10s -> 329.99s]  screen. Cherry, cherry, cherry, cherry. It's cherries. I don't get it. What? Oh, I have to
[330.39s -> 344.02s]  I thought I had to memorize them when it went to zero. Oh, I get it. It's that, okay. I get it now.
[344.02s -> 350.84s]  I get it now. What the hell? Now I can't do, am I done? Did I lose? Am I actually done, done?
[355.30s -> 369.96s]  Oh, shit. What's happening? Wait, did I get some points? I made it to round one. I got $85,
[369.96s -> 377.72s]  $43, and I'm almost level two. All right, I'm, I'm ready to go. I'm going to turn it up a little
[378.36s -> 395.61s]  low. Your one day game is over. See you tomorrow. Stop. I'm so glad I get to actually play. I
[395.61s -> 404.42s]  thought we weren't even going to see this at all today. 46 out of 60. That's it. Do people
[404.42s -> 425.80s]  not know it's back up? All right, now I understand. So is this randomized or is it the same one every
[425.80s -> 435.72s]  time? It's randomized. Okay, that's cool. Wait, I want to be the french fry guy. How do you unlock
[435.72s -> 449.99s]  costumes? I'm going right and I'm going to go straight and then I'm going to go right again.
[459.58s -> 469.83s]  I'm going left. Why do you go faster than other people?
[473.54s -> 491.45s]  Get up. That's just not even possible to do. I'll take fucking first place. I'll take first place.
[492.41s -> 501.64s]  Oh, I'll take first place. Thank you. I'll take it. First place. What did I say? I was looking for
[501.64s -> 518.86s]  10th. All right, now don't fuck up the rest of this. That's cool. How many rounds are there?
[519.42s -> 533.70s]  Struggle. When you're number one, you just sit back and just watch the rest of them. Just,
[533.70s -> 555.96s]  just try. Don't worry. I'll be down there next round. Who's next? Oh, you're not you. Who's left?
[555.96s -> 562.15s]  Oh, there's one person that didn't make it. Is it zooming in on me? How do I do a thing?
[563.51s -> 574.71s]  33 remain. Turn off the music. Um, there's a toucan outfit too. It seems like a lot of outfits.
[575.43s -> 585.30s]  Okay, this is important for me to stay in first place. Dodge the flying fruit
[586.02s -> 590.34s]  and race up the conveyor belt. So dodge the fruit, race up the belt. I'll be first place.
[591.22s -> 602.97s]  Shouldn't I be in the front of the first in the row like Mario Kart? What's this bullshit?
[602.97s -> 621.98s]  Shit. Right at the middle. That was right at me. That was right at me. You aimed it at me.
[621.98s -> 632.38s]  By the way, the bodies are hitting me. The bodies are just crumbling on me.
[636.33s -> 638.01s]  You know what you got to do? You got to hug one of the sides.
[644.65s -> 659.66s]  Shit. Come on. I got to qualify. I'm not going to qualify. 16, eight. What? How did I come in
[659.66s -> 671.94s]  first place and not even qualify in this one? I told you this one sucks. Oh, this is kind of
[671.94s -> 687.90s]  fun though is movement acceleration. Don't jump. Oh, that's good to know. I have coins to spend.
[687.90s -> 689.90s]  Well, let me do like four or five of them and then we'll figure it out.
[690.54s -> 697.83s]  Just don't jump. Keep to the sides and don't jump. When did we get in a full room of 60? Only like
[697.83s -> 709.54s]  30 to 50. Break through doors and race to the finish line. Some are real, some are fake. Oh,
[710.66s -> 726.41s]  wonderful. I like that song. That's the kind of shit that I sing in the bathtub. I like it.
[727.05s -> 735.34s]  Oh, right in the middle. I'm thinking one, two, three, four, five. Just count. Start at one.
[738.25s -> 742.57s]  Just go one, two, three, four, five. Start one, next one, two, next one, three. Watch.
[746.98s -> 770.84s]  One. Get out of the way. Are they all like this? I can't be in last place. There's a huge bottleneck
[770.84s -> 783.83s]  coming up. I kind of fell down. Good. All right. Yeah. Fuck that. I'm going. Get out of the way.
[783.83s -> 800.52s]  Just jump. Just do it like jump. Jive into the end zone. Get out of the way. It's because I walked
[800.52s -> 809.77s]  in the wrong one. I went right to the left side and it instantly put me in last place. Am I stuck
[809.77s -> 828.38s]  here? I walked right to the first wall. What the hell? Oh, I'm stuck. You were so bad that the lobby
[828.38s -> 845.32s]  broke. No, it didn't. No, it didn't. Yeah, we're good. All right. So you're saying I can buy
[845.32s -> 863.40s]  something. 500 kudos. Earn fame. Outfits. How do you buy outfits? Oh, wait. This is 500. Okay.
[863.40s -> 876.78s]  I have 12. All right. I can do ninja. I can do featured items. DLC store. Regular items.
[876.78s -> 890.84s]  There's be the egg. 7,000. I can't do that. You need crowns. I'm just going to get cucumber.
[891.56s -> 918.84s]  Oh, it's probably. I'm glad I do that. This is just green. This is a big cucumber. Have to
[918.84s -> 932.50s]  win at least once. You're a pickle of 2500 subs over two streams. Won't buy $7,000 worth of fake
[932.50s -> 947.98s]  currency. Hey, first of all, I just opened the game 20 minutes ago. He turned himself into a
[947.98s -> 953.40s]  pickle. Oh, I see what you're doing. Run and balance across rows of seesaws to reach the finish
[953.40s -> 975.48s]  line. I'm going to lose this one. So you have to balance. Jesus, the whole thing turns. Well,
[975.48s -> 987.35s]  we can't all go on the left side. You're going to dump me. Don't dump me. Balance it out first.
[988.39s -> 1000.39s]  Shit. Oh no, they're going to dump us. No, no, no, no, no. It's okay. I got lucky too. I'm fine.
[1002.30s -> 1006.52s]  These people are just ruining this. I'm not going to wait around. These people,
[1006.52s -> 1008.92s]  these people are idiots. I'm going. Oh my God. I have to go this way.
[1010.36s -> 1027.75s]  Put it back up. Is there a punch? I'm okay. I'm still fine.
[1033.43s -> 1041.53s]  There is punching. All right, we've got to even this out so we can all get across.
[1042.17s -> 1058.34s]  No, somebody go on the right side, please. Oh my God. It almost didn't work. Wait, how do you do
[1058.34s -> 1081.56s]  that? Grab people. Well, how do you grab people? R2. That's kind of mean. This is the guy that was
[1081.56s -> 1095.40s]  doing it. Depending on your preference. Oh, okay. I don't think this guy even, this is just like
[1095.40s -> 1104.12s]  such a seasoned veteran. He just kind of walking around. The worst game is slime game. So many
[1104.12s -> 1112.90s]  people get knocked out. We'll see if we find it. You have to grab some ledges. How do you pull
[1112.90s -> 1118.68s]  yourself up? If I jump and hold R2, will I automatically do it or just hold up or do I
[1118.68s -> 1131.16s]  have to keep holding R2? Move between rotating rings to avoid falling into the slime. This is
[1131.16s -> 1144.62s]  what you were talking about. All right, come on. Let's go. Avoid the slime.
[1148.30s -> 1163.86s]  That's slime right there, isn't it? Can I touch the donuts? Where's this next slime? Oh,
[1163.86s -> 1168.98s]  shit. This is going to make me throw up. Okay. I'm good. This one's going wicked fast. Why?
[1170.10s -> 1175.05s]  Slime incoming. I just jumped into a slime. Slime over there. Go back.
[1175.05s -> 1196.98s]  Do they just keep going back? Get off me. Oh, I'm just trying to like kill a guy. Oh, shit.
[1196.98s -> 1222.49s]  Oh, shit. Oh, shit. How many more? Oh, you fucker. I deserved it. I know because I'm trying to push
[1222.49s -> 1232.33s]  people off the edge. I was trying to push people off the edge. I deserve it. Why didn't I do that?
[1232.33s -> 1255.05s]  I was right about to qualify for round three. I'm going to have trouble in this game because
[1255.05s -> 1259.93s]  I can't pay attention for more than one consecutive round. I will try as hard as
[1259.93s -> 1265.05s]  I can on two rounds in a row. Then by the third round, I'll start talking to you guys about an
[1265.05s -> 1279.50s]  animal I saw in the backyard yesterday. It'll be over. Here we go. All right. Let's get a full one.
[1284.01s -> 1295.32s]  Change your username to improve matchmaking. What do you mean? Obstacles. It's just obstacles. Watch
[1295.32s -> 1308.01s]  out. This one's kind of short. All right. That's going to be really hard up there. All right.
[1308.01s -> 1324.81s]  I'm ready. What animal was it? It was a chickadee. It was eating a bug. That one's spinning.
[1333.75s -> 1346.62s]  That was mean. No, don't get wedged in. Y'all can't go in at the same time.
[1347.58s -> 1375.82s]  Wait, all those people just got screwed. Are they done? Birds just pretend to be real.
[1376.46s -> 1392.62s]  What? Can we be spied on? Birds aren't real. They're just robots. Birds are spy cams. So what are
[1392.62s -> 1405.45s]  the eggs? You don't leave two Logitech cameras together and then come back in a few months and
[1405.45s -> 1419.94s]  there's six of them. I don't know how that works. Wait, use RT to grab a tail? I don't even know
[1419.94s -> 1424.18s]  what that said. I'm going to instantly eliminate. Make sure that your team has more tails than the
[1424.18s -> 1432.31s]  rest of the. What do you mean tail? We're on teams. We have to grab tails. Whose tail?
[1433.03s -> 1459.08s]  Our tails? Their tails? You got it. Got it. I don't understand. What do I get? Do I get a tail back?
[1461.72s -> 1477.82s]  Get his tail. Golden tails. Oh, you mean this guy right here. Oh, shit. I get it.
[1477.82s -> 1507.43s]  Who has one? Give me that. That's a good strategy. Just go by the mallet.
[1515.85s -> 1523.67s]  I need it. I didn't get it. We only have three tails in 30 seconds. Go get another one.
[1524.23s -> 1544.12s]  We got five. All right. I got to protect this guy. That's me. That's my guy. Give me that tail.
[1545.58s -> 1572.02s]  Oh, come on. No. No, it's us. It's us. Fuck. This game's so hard. No, that was my fucking teammate.
[1572.02s -> 1575.22s]  My fucking teammates couldn't do anything. They fucking weren't grabbing tails and everything.
[1576.54s -> 1579.26s]  I had a tail for like 10 seconds. None of my fucking teammates had a tail for more than
[1579.26s -> 1597.94s]  fucking one second, dude. Toxic. You immediately gave it. Yeah, but I didn't even know how the
[1597.94s -> 1618.68s]  game worked. You need to smash the PC in rage. I don't think this is a rage game. I think this
[1618.68s -> 1626.52s]  is a sit with your feet up on the couch with a bowl of pretzels on your crotch. Just eating
[1627.16s -> 1638.76s]  and just like kind of giggling every few minutes. I'm not sure this is a rage game,
[1640.94s -> 1646.22s]  though. We'll see. Are you watching a stoner comedy?
[1655.75s -> 1680.14s]  Kind of. No, there's too many people in the way. Good. I qualify right here.
[1689.13s -> 1695.37s]  In the middle. I have to get off of me. Go back to fucking Rugrats.
[1697.05s -> 1714.14s]  He's just trying to push people off of the edge. And that is what made your downfall.
[1714.14s -> 1721.06s]  Now I'm in first place. You put a one. Does that matter at all? By the way,
[1721.78s -> 1732.26s]  it doesn't matter at all as long as you qualify. Okay. So that's why people are standing at the
[1732.26s -> 1736.42s]  edge and just pushing every single sorry motherfucker that comes over here and just
[1736.42s -> 1739.22s]  pushing them off the edge because they just want to make sure they lose in the first round.
[1740.10s -> 1764.86s]  Okay, that sounds like fun. I want slurpy guy to make it. Oh, that's unfortunate. How many
[1764.86s -> 1772.78s]  rounds are there? Three? You get more points the better that you do. There are five. Oh boy.
[1773.82s -> 1780.98s]  I've got to do this. No, not this one. I hate this one. Wait. No, I like. Okay. This is I
[1780.98s -> 1789.13s]  fucked this one up last time. I'm not going to mess it up this time. The idea is to just memorize
[1789.13s -> 1793.78s]  where two of them are. So I'm only going to memorize where the cherries and the grapes are.
[1796.97s -> 1801.13s]  I have to look at it from the same angle. Okay. Two cherry cherry on here.
[1802.09s -> 1806.46s]  Two cherries in the corner. Bananas right there. Just I know where the cherries are.
[1807.34s -> 1812.92s]  I know where the cherries are. And I know this too, but I wait, this is the last one you see.
[1813.80s -> 1825.50s]  What does he want us to do? Jerry. I'm safe right here. I was an asshole and I'm about to pay for
[1825.50s -> 1829.90s]  it. I don't do that. I was kidding. Right. Looking for a watermelon. Don't touch me.
[1830.62s -> 1840.28s]  Okay. Grapes. Don't do it. Okay. I don't know. Okay. Watermelon grape. I know where the grapes
[1840.28s -> 1843.80s]  and I know the watermelons are. I don't know what anything else is. Oh no. Okay. I think it's over
[1843.80s -> 1863.46s]  here. Okay. It's cherries, apples and bananas. I mean blueberries. I don't know. Okay. I know
[1863.46s -> 1869.94s]  where the apples are. I don't know. I know the oranges are. Wait, is this an orange or an apple?
[1869.94s -> 1885.43s]  Yeah. Finally, I made it to the third round. First time I've ever been to the third round.
[1885.43s -> 1908.63s]  Eliminate very many people. There's still 30 people. Not this again. Oh wait. Jump and dive
[1908.63s -> 1914.33s]  through the hoops to score points for your team. I should be pretty good at this. I have to dive
[1914.33s -> 1923.46s]  through the hoops. All right. I'm going to do so well here. Watch this shit. Yellow team is about
[1923.46s -> 1945.43s]  to have like 10 to 15 points. I didn't know it did that. All right. Let's go. I'm going to go up
[1945.43s -> 1971.96s]  here. Huh? I didn't get that one. How? What? I'm staying over here. I'm going to get this one. I'm
[1971.96s -> 1978.14s]  going to get this one. I'm going to get this one. It's all right. I got it, buddy. Good. That's a
[1978.14s -> 2005.72s]  double. Don't even go for it. You're not going to. A lot over this way. I had that one. No, we're
[2005.72s -> 2019.85s]  fine. Hey, right here. I'm going to spawn right here. 37. They're coming back though. This is not
[2019.85s -> 2033.51s]  good. 38, 31, 20 seconds. Anything can happen in 20 seconds. No. Why is Brett so good?
[2037.51s -> 2046.65s]  Oh, they're not coming back. 38, 43, 38. There we go. Blue team going.
[2047.61s -> 2063.69s]  That was total zone control. Was it? Damn. Now we're down to 20. Okay. This is where it gets
[2063.69s -> 2078.30s]  interesting. Zoned. Work together to push your ball to the finish line before the other team.
[2081.14s -> 2092.97s]  Oh no. Okay. Okay. I get it. I'm on blue team. So I'm going to go on the right side.
[2093.77s -> 2098.33s]  Just be gentle. Honestly, this really should be like two people doing this.
[2099.21s -> 2111.19s]  I'm actually not doing that bad. All right. Somebody has to sacrifice themselves to get it
[2111.19s -> 2121.96s]  up here. Turn it. Turn it. Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn. Good. Keep going this way. Weave it. Weave
[2121.96s -> 2131.24s]  it. Weave it. Don't push it backwards. Weave it. It's not going to fit through there. Oh no. Oh no.
[2133.05s -> 2136.41s]  We're fighting each other. Just go. Oh no. We're going to lose.
[2137.21s -> 2149.99s]  We're going to go. Get it down the hill. What are you doing? Wait, it's these guys. They're
[2149.99s -> 2173.48s]  infiltrating us. Who's going to get eliminated? No, it's going to be red. Reds was stuck. Is that
[2173.48s -> 2191.70s]  what they kept on infiltrating? 13 remain. Is this the last event? Okay. I got to play well here.
[2191.70s -> 2200.01s]  What's the last event? Four pieces fall away when you stand on them. Keep moving and survive
[2200.01s -> 2212.57s]  longest to win the crown. What? So don't step on any pieces. Oh shit. But what about these ones?
[2213.13s -> 2233.02s]  I'm going to stay up all night. I got to, I have a plan. I got a plan. Just do it very slowly.
[2241.75s -> 2244.22s]  You can have your own spot. I don't care.
[2261.80s -> 2300.04s]  I saw him coming from my peripheral and it fucking freaked me out. He sprinted by. He was just being
[2300.04s -> 2306.12s]  an asshole. He was just trying to dump all the, I was, could have been up top still. Oh, I had it.
[2306.12s -> 2314.09s]  I was in fifth pillar. Oh, damn it. It's just these two. It's this guy. That's the guy that ran
[2314.09s -> 2329.06s]  across and just was cutting everybody off. He wins. The guy that's made it a brain matter.
[2330.10s -> 2340.63s]  Hey, good job fall guy. Three, eight, five, four. I think he's level two.
[2343.11s -> 2361.88s]  I got bubble gum. Sure. Put it on. You're doing really well. I thought I could stay up top. I
[2361.88s -> 2368.52s]  was one of two people up top and then I fell and my dumb idiot brain didn't realize that all the
[2368.52s -> 2373.03s]  other layers were going to be just ripped apart. I don't know why I was thinking, Oh, I'll be up
[2373.03s -> 2388.02s]  here for a little while. I fell through all, I fell through four layers. You got to be Pickle Rick.
[2388.02s -> 2394.81s]  No, I'm getting, I'm going, this is cotton candy. He's like, aren't these my colors?
[2395.53s -> 2417.29s]  Where's my chin? I'm more green, a little more green. Bad idea to go to the middle one. I told
[2417.29s -> 2423.93s]  you it could be a hot dog, all kinds of different food condiments and stuff. This is awesome.
[2427.40s -> 2455.69s]  That was bullshit. And I did a front flip too. Get in there. Get in there. No, no, no, no, no,
[2455.69s -> 2486.86s]  no, no, no, no, no. Oh no. Who's the last one? Oh, not you. Not you. 39. So what, what, what is
[2486.86s -> 2513.43s]  the most eliminated round one or like three? Fuck. I think this is the thing everybody hated
[2525.80s -> 2529.32s]  qualified one only. Okay. I was going to say only one fucking person qualifies.
[2537.43s -> 2542.14s]  I'm going to take this slow. Wait, good idea. Bad idea. Let's do the right way.
[2555.80s -> 2558.28s]  Wait, there's a secret over here. That's not
[2559.00s -> 2579.02s]  good. It's just like too many people that don't jump. Whoa. They bounce backwards.
[2579.02s -> 2589.00s]  I'm good. You had to jump at the exact same time. Didn't you? You had to do that. Why did we both
[2589.00s -> 2629.06s]  do it at the exact same time? The guy was just like standing there. Oh, I can be Patrick. Yeah,
[2629.06s -> 2644.42s]  I'm being Patrick. Your pretzels would be everywhere right now. No, no, no. I would make
[2644.42s -> 2657.46s]  sure that the integrity of the pretzels was completely and totally sound Patrick impression.
[2657.46s -> 2667.66s]  Okay. Uh, SpongeBob, what's that supposed to mean? I don't understand. That'll be a hundred
[2667.66s -> 2693.27s]  dollars. Please don't do that. Is this a PS4 exclusive? No, it is a PC. I'm down with the
[2693.27s -> 2700.89s]  losers. Great. Oh shit. There's a naked Patrick. I have to be, I have to be aware that I'm not
[2700.89s -> 2718.98s]  the naked Patrick. I'm regular Pant Patrick. Okay. I get hit by reverse upside down ball
[2718.98s -> 2746.66s]  Patrick. Sens Fortress. So yeah, it kind of is like Sens Fortress. Okay. Does the hot dog soup
[2746.66s -> 2769.82s]  cost like $7? You can earn it. Okay. That's cool. Is it going to choose wants to choose something?
[2769.82s -> 2780.86s]  I don't think it's might be locked out. Oh, okay. All right. Now I know what this is. I'm going to
[2780.86s -> 2785.50s]  be very, very, very serious. You know what that means? I'm going to go to the corner. I'm going
[2785.50s -> 2790.86s]  to put myself in the corner and back my tail into a, into the wall and no one will touch me
[2790.86s -> 2808.49s]  for the entire game. But I don't have a tail. Get away from him. You're not going to touch him.
[2814.23s -> 2818.87s]  We have four. Okay. I'm occupying one of their premium content players.
[2819.67s -> 2849.69s]  Can you get it? You little shit. Hey, come here. You little bastards.
[2849.69s -> 2881.05s]  Oh, who has one? Who has one? Who has one? How does red team has zero? All right. Give me a
[2881.05s -> 2906.49s]  fucking premium two cam. What? You didn't touch my back. You didn't touch my back.
[2907.13s -> 2919.62s]  You didn't touch my back. Oh, it doesn't matter. You just have to grab the person. Oh, I thought
[2919.62s -> 2926.06s]  you had to like grab their tail. I was going to say, I thought now I get why I couldn't cheese it.
[2926.06s -> 2933.50s]  Okay. I'm trying to grab their tails. I'm trying to grab them from behind.
[2934.22s -> 2948.79s]  They got carried. That's all right. Carried to first place. Grab eggs. Store them in your team's
[2948.79s -> 2956.89s]  nest. Okay. We have to get eggs and put them in our nest. Put the most eggs in your team's basket.
[2959.11s -> 2977.99s]  Oh, this is cool. I like this. I almost didn't get one. Hey, get out of here. Get the fuck out
[2977.99s -> 2992.17s]  of here. Get this guy. You're not taking any eggs. Come here. Oh, rabble rabble. Whatever.
[2992.17s -> 3002.15s]  Fuck it. I don't care. Wait, somebody do we need? Oh, he's just getting in here.
[3005.75s -> 3027.30s]  Get. Why can't I get out? Shit. Give me the golden egg. That golden egg's not getting out of here.
[3028.34s -> 3030.50s]  I will fight you to the death to keep that golden egg in here.
[3032.10s -> 3044.92s]  Don't let him get that golden egg. Stop him. Good job. Okay. Orange team has eight.
[3046.12s -> 3064.28s]  I'll let him take that golden egg out. What are they doing this? 23. Stop. They're just
[3064.28s -> 3071.98s]  pillaging us. Don't let them take them out. Get that back in here. All right. I'm going to,
[3071.98s -> 3081.80s]  I'm going to hold him. Little bastard. I'm not letting you get away with this one.
[3098.44s -> 3108.04s]  You lost quite a few there. So what was the deal with what they were? There was no more eggs on
[3108.04s -> 3116.86s]  the board. So they just desperately tried to invade our nest. It's not going to work.
[3116.86s -> 3134.63s]  All right. I remember this one. That's the point. I'm going for this one behind me.
[3140.12s -> 3156.28s]  Count is two. Oh, come on. Good. I'm going to stay right around here.
[3157.24s -> 3169.14s]  The side is kind of neglected. I told you the side was neglected. Shit. How come you're so good?
[3171.66s -> 3177.77s]  No, this red guy, the red guy. I'm standing up here. We're going to get his camera. Please
[3178.33s -> 3183.10s]  camera. Get, come on. Spawn up here. This get swollen up here. Spawn. I'm really, you're not
[3183.10s -> 3223.26s]  going to do the one spot that nobody is. Come on. I'm trying to help my 34, 35. I'm contributing
[3223.26s -> 3238.09s]  this game very much. So don't tell me I'm not carried. Yo, you mean I'm the one carrying.
[3240.18s -> 3259.93s]  I'm responsible for at least 10 points on this team, at least seven, but okay. Let's round that
[3259.93s -> 3275.50s]  up. I got to get down to the final 10. Again, here we are. Come on. This is it. I got to win
[3275.50s -> 3288.71s]  one of these. What's the final event? Ball mountain. Reach the top of the mountain in first
[3288.71s -> 3294.79s]  and use R T to grab the crown. Reach the top of the mountain. All right. I'm going straight
[3294.79s -> 3307.24s]  up the middle. Grab the crown. All right. Right at the middle or hard left going right side.
[3307.96s -> 3313.62s]  Holy shit. Nobody went right. It was a brilliant idea. Can I jump over this?
[3314.90s -> 3332.49s]  You're going to go, I'm going to get it. I'm going to get that crap.
[3333.13s -> 3339.32s]  Did that just hit me after the fact? That's okay. I'm still in it.
[3339.32s -> 3349.96s]  Oh, somebody fucking got it. Why did I get hit by the ball? The ball landed over me.
[3355.38s -> 3369.32s]  Okay. I got hit by the ball that landed like 10 feet behind me. That was a buck. Oh,
[3369.32s -> 3383.82s]  kind of like Patrick though. Wait. Oh, that was kind of cool. Watermelon. Now I'm going to be
[3383.82s -> 3405.50s]  watermelon. Watermelon Patrick. Lightning melon. Yeah. No. Purple is based. I want to do
[3405.50s -> 3412.70s]  watermelon. Wait. Watermelon's not this. What is a watermelon? That's watermelon, right? Yeah.
[3413.42s -> 3428.92s]  Do I have enough to do anything? 1300 featured items. It can be a hamburger. Get kudos. Boxer,
[3428.92s -> 3441.61s]  fish. Oh, I kind of want to be the baseball guy. Help him. Help him. Help him. Buy gems.
[3444.36s -> 3465.34s]  Baseball is top tier. You have $20,000. Spend five. I hold on. Let me. If I do this,
[3465.98s -> 3472.74s]  how much should I get? I get small kudos, large kudos. No, but I don't want to just buy a bunch
[3472.74s -> 3483.43s]  of shit. Small fall guys. Cool. Small kudos bundle. It's $10. Should I do it? All right.
[3483.43s -> 3491.13s]  I'm doing it. I do it. No. Well, everyone wanted me to do. Everyone said to do this.
[3491.93s -> 3497.74s]  Just earn the kudos. Yeah. I'm not buying anything. No. You know what? You guys almost
[3497.74s -> 3508.73s]  just got me to buy shit. All right. How do I? Is there a bigger menu? It's like a DLC store,
[3508.73s -> 3514.42s]  but where's the, I mean, regular items? Where's is this? Is this it? That's, is this how you get?
[3515.06s -> 3524.26s]  Or do you have to like buy it in the DLC store? Oh, it just rotates. Okay. Well, I need more
[3524.26s -> 3537.10s]  money. And this is a watermelon. Just refreshes. Oh, okay. What do you mean? No. I mean, the lines
[3537.10s -> 3554.22s]  are a little too dark, but it was by the DLC. I don't just to have like a hamburger. Did I get
[3554.22s -> 3564.82s]  helmet on? The outside of a watermelon is not red. Yeah. I, I know. Why am I the weird guy?
[3564.82s -> 3583.45s]  Because I'm talking about the outside of a watermelon. Watermelon. Okay. Yeah. I'm,
[3583.45s -> 3589.51s]  that's right. It's just a little too dark. Hold on. I gotta go. Um, it's just a little dark. It
[3589.51s -> 3602.63s]  needs to be green, like dark green. Just going to follow it. All right. I made up all the time. I
[3602.63s -> 3608.70s]  lost. It's not red on the outside. It's red on the inside. If you smashed me in the head with a
[3608.70s -> 3621.66s]  mallet, maybe I would open up and be red. Just follow it. Don't fight it. Just follow it.
[3629.27s -> 3641.37s]  See him had his hands out. He was like, I'm going to get you, you asshole. What happened? It was a
[3641.37s -> 3649.61s]  jump. I had to jump over that. Don't fall through the little butt crack there, please.
[3650.33s -> 3653.99s]  I can't get eliminated in the first round. You know what I mean? Like I can't.
[3656.07s -> 3677.06s]  I was too busy looking up watermelons. Whatever. I'm so, this game is so addicting because you,
[3677.06s -> 3680.74s]  I just want to win one, but it's probably never going to happen. That's how they keep you here.
[3682.95s -> 3686.71s]  You desperately want to just win one time, but it's probably not going to happen.
[3689.69s -> 3697.22s]  You'll come close, but you'll never win. I think that's just the BR marketing scheme.
[3698.12s -> 3703.40s]  Just make people come really, really close to winning every single time, but they never do.
[3704.12s -> 3715.48s]  So they keep you there. It's gambling. Yeah. It's just sitting at a slot machine. You,
[3715.48s -> 3723.16s]  you put in like 10 bucks, you lose five, you win 10, you lose four, you win two, you lose eight,
[3723.16s -> 3738.92s]  you win. It's just a slot machine. Don't get hit by the debris. All right. Which one? I'm going
[3738.92s -> 3750.54s]  in the middle. Nope. Nope. Oh shit. I didn't think it was going to be real. All right. Right.
[3750.54s -> 3768.06s]  That's fine. We just have to call desk qualify. Don't matter. It's 42 of us all in the same spot.
[3768.14s -> 3770.22s]  It's just who's lucky enough to walk by first.
[3775.24s -> 3804.31s]  It's black Friday. Oh, that's another watermelon. I have to win one of these.
[3805.75s -> 3809.75s]  Keep your balls in your area to earn points. Keep. So we have to keep our balls in
[3810.86s -> 3819.00s]  our area. So the goal, I'm going to be on offense. I just, just like a game of soccer,
[3819.00s -> 3822.20s]  I'm going to go on offense and I'm going to go like, I'm going to go drop, kick the goalie.
[3822.20s -> 3827.00s]  Okay. Here we go. Ready? I'm going to get red ball. It's red. They don't expect like three of
[3827.00s -> 3840.33s]  us to come get red. I didn't expect that. I got it. Just keep it over here. I'm going to go get a
[3840.33s -> 3845.54s]  blue ball or a red one. Blue. Nope. I'm going to, there's nobody over here at this red one writer.
[3846.58s -> 3849.83s]  I'm going for this one. There's only two people on red, two people on yellow. Let's go for it.
[3852.98s -> 3857.06s]  On the side, side, side, side. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. On the side.
[3857.94s -> 3875.35s]  Good. Keep it going. Excellent. Okay. They don't have any. I just feel like I'm playing rescue.
[3875.91s -> 3879.50s]  You play with three or four friends and one of them instantly just hates the whole game
[3879.50s -> 3885.34s]  and is destroyed. Like, yeah, dude, you picked Australia and I came over from Europe and fucking
[3885.34s -> 3892.20s]  just blacked you out. And now you have to watch us have to spend the next four hours trying to
[3892.20s -> 3903.78s]  fight each other. Although late game, having that Australia zone, that's two, that's two units
[3903.78s -> 3909.11s]  every run. That's a strategic location to have in risk. No one's even paying attention to me.
[3912.31s -> 3927.18s]  We're going to get it fucking eliminated. Hi. It's tight. I mean, over time. How did red get all
[3927.18s -> 3958.97s]  these? What happened? You were too busy talking. We're just running into each other. Last time I
[3958.97s -> 3964.89s]  checked guys, you don't play the game of chess by you smushing all of your pieces into all of my
[3964.89s -> 3984.06s]  pieces. And whoever has more pieces on the board in 30 seconds wins the game. That's how you play
[3984.06s -> 3995.30s]  chess. The guy that picked Australia won. It's actually like a really annoying place to have.
[3996.42s -> 4003.05s]  You put your troops on that, that little zone there. It's so impossible. You just put like 500
[4003.05s -> 4009.62s]  units right in the entrance. You just have Australia the whole time. Let me, I gotta get to like the top
[4009.70s -> 4018.55s]  10 again. Last game is so nerve wrecking. When are they going to have the DLC where I can just
[4018.55s -> 4024.44s]  pay to be in the final 10? You know, when are they going to invent the Disney fast pass
[4024.44s -> 4031.66s]  of this game? Right. It's like, Oh, 13 people have been eliminated and we've got one that just joined
[4032.70s -> 4036.54s]  the fall guy fast pass. You'd be hated when you, everyone would just gang up on you.
[4036.94s -> 4063.06s]  What's even possible to do this DNQ did not qualify in the first round.
[4064.44s -> 4069.16s]  Unless somebody does something real dumb. Like that guy, the guy that you just watched. Yeah,
[4069.16s -> 4073.40s]  like dude, you and me get it. We get it. Like we're the only two that aren't going to qualify.
[4073.40s -> 4095.11s]  We'll just be a fruit salad together. Is this guy disconnected? Oh, he's back. How is this still
[4095.11s -> 4111.75s]  possible? Why is it still going? Wait, I just have to beat the pineapple guy. You're throwing
[4111.75s -> 4123.69s]  for views. No, I got trapped in that windmill. I could have made it. I just was sitting there
[4123.69s -> 4127.80s]  talking to the pineapple guy and he freaked out. You know what probably happened? The guy was
[4127.80s -> 4132.60s]  probably sleeping in his chair with his pretzels on his crotch and he was just hanging out, just
[4132.60s -> 4145.74s]  stoned. And when I grabbed him, his controller vibrated and he freaked out. Whoa. Whoa. Oh,
[4145.74s -> 4155.45s]  shit. It's just drool is all over the side of his mouth. And embarrassingly he looks over and there's
[4155.45s -> 4159.13s]  a puddle of just wetness right next to his head and he just fucking puts a blanket on it. I don't
[4159.13s -> 4183.43s]  want anyone to see that. It's embarrassing. I am going to qualify this time. I'm going to just be
[4183.43s -> 4212.49s]  quiet. Quiet. No, we put too much weight on it. Why don't we just all keep it? There's a bunch
[4212.49s -> 4216.57s]  of people waiting for this to come down, but we just keep ruining it. We just keep making it too low.
[4216.57s -> 4249.61s]  No, I don't want to do it. Oh, not yet. Okay, go now. Are you trying to kill us? Only 10 people
[4249.61s -> 4273.67s]  have made it so far. It's penis music. I hate that I get it now. But you know what I'm saying?
[4273.67s -> 4279.53s]  I hate that I get it. Like how the hell do I get penis music? I'm not supposed to get that.
[4279.69s -> 4306.17s]  I'm trying to drag this guy over the finish line so he stops doing this. All right, man. You don't
[4306.17s -> 4321.29s]  have to build a farm all the way in the corner of the map. I already took your castle. Nobody
[4321.29s -> 4341.58s]  gets that shit? No, we played Warcraft 3 online back in 2002. I forgot. It's too old. I want the
[4341.58s -> 4351.48s]  soda can one. I hate this one. I mean, you could just ask the audience and just go to where most
[4351.48s -> 4369.96s]  people are standing, but sometimes the audience gets it wrong. This is boomer fruit, but eating
[4369.96s -> 4375.05s]  a banana is a boomer thing. Like eating. All right. I know what that man in the right hand
[4375.05s -> 4388.28s]  and the grapes right there. This is right, right? Come on, dude. Come on. Why push him off? Why push
[4388.28s -> 4392.92s]  him off? That was so, that wasn't even called for. That guy's probably so sad right now. He got it
[4392.92s -> 4401.24s]  right and he lost. Oranges, watermelons. Okay. Orange, watermelon, banana. I know what they are.
[4404.34s -> 4406.66s]  What's the, it's a, I didn't, there was a cherry.
[4410.38s -> 4423.82s]  I'm on the edge. I don't like being on the edge. Hey, all right. What is it?
[4424.70s -> 4429.05s]  Cherry, banana, orange, watermelon, cherry, banana, orange, watermelon, cherry,
[4429.05s -> 4452.15s]  banana, orange, watermelon, cherry. This is where the grapes. Holy shit. I don't think anybody lost.
[4454.26s -> 4467.78s]  Oh, that guy did. Oh yeah. That's the guy we would have all made it, but somebody pushed him
[4467.78s -> 4475.61s]  off the edge. And that motherfucker was on camera. You know, we saw it happen. All right.
[4475.61s -> 4481.54s]  This is the egg one. I don't like this one. It's too long. I'm going right for a gold egg though.
[4481.54s -> 4516.46s]  Golden egg. Get that golden egg, please. Good. Nice. Nice work. I'll take that egg from you.
[4516.46s -> 4530.63s]  Don't just defend. What? Holy shit. Another golden goose. Just block the game of football.
[4530.63s -> 4551.72s]  That's all this is. Don't let him get back you. Oh shit. That guy just had, he just gave them like
[4551.72s -> 4578.33s]  10 points. Get it in there. Nice work. Blue can take it. Blue has nothing. Okay. I'm all right
[4578.33s -> 4587.19s]  with this. Just defend. Get that D, get that D, the D, the D. They're going to try to get out
[4587.19s -> 4611.34s]  and just fucking stop them. Wow. Completely unguarded. This is a mistake. Defensive genius.
[4612.06s -> 4622.68s]  Defensive genius. What's up, sir? All right. We got two more, right? I gotta beat one of these.
[4623.48s -> 4636.68s]  You can throw eggs by diving, letting go. Yeah. Don't choke. Depends on what this is. Fruit shoot.
[4636.68s -> 4645.40s]  Dodge the flying fruit. Okay. You got to pick a side and just commit to dodging and not try to be
[4645.40s -> 4678.26s]  first. All right. I was already down. I had damage mitigation. Pretty good dodge right there. See
[4678.26s -> 4721.29s]  the little shimmy? No. Fucking plum. Yes. Spent right by him. That was the worst noise.
[4724.36s -> 4732.17s]  That was a car. I don't know. I'm ready to win. This is the last event. I got to win. All right.
[4732.17s -> 4737.99s]  Super mountain. I hate this shit. Someone's always better than you. The number one rule of BR is
[4737.99s -> 4743.27s]  somebody's always better than you. No matter what. There's always three people better than you in
[4743.27s -> 4758.44s]  every game. Watch out for those balls. There's one coming. They don't even look.
[4788.26s -> 4792.18s]  I'm never going to win. You can't win. There's no winning in this game.
[4792.74s -> 4796.50s]  You don't win. There's no winning. Somebody's always going to be in first place in front of
[4796.50s -> 4808.71s]  you. This is the carrot on a stick. They make sure the carrot's still there so you buy a bunch of
[4808.71s -> 4829.62s]  fucking kudos bars. Wait. I got a crown. Oh shit. I want it. What am I going to do with the crown?
[4831.24s -> 4844.68s]  Stealthy. Ooh. Boxer. I'm going to save my crown. I don't want. Yeah. I'm saving the crown.
[4845.93s -> 4850.42s]  Let's go put this on though. Okay. What do I get? Upper. Yes.
[4851.14s -> 4888.47s]  All right. I need to change to my favorite colors. The Boston Red Sox. All right. That's fine.
[4888.47s -> 4896.84s]  No pattern. I'm just going to be. Yeah. I'm going to be pink. Finally. I can stand out.
[4909.77s -> 4925.08s]  That's like Peter Griffin. I'm stopping doing that. Anytime you go like
[4927.48s -> 4930.84s]  that. That's Peter Griffin doing a funny song. I can't do that.
[4936.52s -> 4940.04s]  There are 10k people. Yeah. There are. Holy shit. There are 10k people here. Hey.
[4940.68s -> 4946.02s]  You think I'll be able to beat this new fall guys? Or do I have to come back and do this
[4946.02s -> 4955.18s]  tomorrow and try to win before I do anything else in my entire life? Like I have to win once.
[4964.18s -> 4976.89s]  They're keeping me in the casino. I have to win. Someone is as unique as me.
[4976.89s -> 4990.01s]  All right. Stop trying to go up down. I was waiting too. I was waiting and I didn't even
[4990.01s -> 5011.34s]  get it. I'm now I'm stuck forever. I'm actually not in a bad spot somehow. I just got destroyed.
[5011.34s -> 5035.46s]  All right. I'm not going up the middle. I have to be safe quickly. Quickly. I was just in the road.
[5035.46s -> 5040.95s]  Oh my fucking God. I'm so mad right now. We were all waiting at the bus stop. And for some reason,
[5040.95s -> 5048.92s]  I was waiting on the road and we were in the highway. I still did it. 36.
[5052.04s -> 5056.84s]  That guy right there. That that that chocolate mint sprinkles guy is probably so mad that he
[5056.84s -> 5073.78s]  didn't go over. He was making it his job to fuck everybody up. That dude just had both hands
[5073.78s -> 5078.98s]  over and over again. He's just smashing his fucking desk over and over again. Both hands
[5078.98s -> 5116.06s]  projecting. Whatever. Too many. Too many. Only 30 people can qualify. This is not good.
[5118.14s -> 5128.25s]  No. But we have to go to the how we do this. We just lose. Stop doing it. I'm going the other way.
[5129.13s -> 5131.53s]  I'm going the other way. You guys are stupid waiting for the bus.
[5133.48s -> 5137.48s]  The bus is always going to come on this side. Yeah. Yeah. Look at that. Everybody's like,
[5137.48s -> 5150.70s]  oh, wait, maybe we should do that too. Hey, what does that do? Why is this? Why am I? Why
[5150.70s -> 5159.88s]  have a cursor on me? Why am I selected? Somebody about to drop like a nuke on me was I don't
[5159.88s -> 5196.76s]  understand. What's this for? No. Excuse me. They all just spun on top of me. Oh, come on.
[5197.96s -> 5220.14s]  It's too slippery and we can't do it. That just saved me. Is this six of us?
[5226.46s -> 5229.90s]  Really liked getting telephragged by eight people that all respond in front of me.
[5244.87s -> 5247.43s]  Hand desk with both hands and fucking scream.
[5252.22s -> 5286.86s]  pretzels are everywhere. Oh, CBD. Nobody listened to that guy. Liar. And he's just trying to fucking
[5286.86s -> 5302.12s]  mess with me. And he's trying to defame me. First round is always not the worst.
[5302.84s -> 5305.16s]  Always the easiest. Why can't they all be like this?
[5307.53s -> 5333.48s]  Why did I fall? I was just running. I want to be dumb. Why are these people all getting thrown
[5333.48s -> 5348.15s]  over here? Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Funny. Yeah. Target the streamer. Yeah. That wicked funny.
[5348.15s -> 5353.74s]  Yeah. Of course. Right. Yup. Says German on a five up there. Yeah. Grab me. Target the streamer.
[5356.55s -> 5371.80s]  Nobody can even tell who is who. Right. Doesn't even say your name.
[5372.44s -> 5387.45s]  This might sound really weird. Don't you want to see these people?
[5388.57s -> 5394.84s]  This is the greatest compilation box of jelly bellies ever.
[5403.88s -> 5407.72s]  By the way, what happened to jelly? Jelly bellies could have really, really stepped a game up.
[5407.72s -> 5414.01s]  They decided just not to. It's been the same gross peanut butter flavor. No, no, no. Butter
[5414.01s -> 5422.06s]  flavored throw up smell induced vomit jelly beans forever. Buttered popcorn. Like if you eat that.
[5423.32s -> 5431.82s]  I'm sorry. I can't understand how they could have said like 14 words out of order.
[5432.92s -> 5442.60s]  You know what I mean though? Butter popcorn jelly bellies are just there. I feel like they're
[5442.60s -> 5466.39s]  only in there for people to make like jokes about. I don't, I don't like them. Don't all do the same
[5466.39s -> 5485.96s]  thing at once. All right. I'm safe for now. It's going faster. It's the worst thing to pick. Wait.
[5485.96s -> 5491.00s]  Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy.
[5493.58s -> 5507.18s]  Oh boy. Oh boy. Like jump on this one. Oh no, I shouldn't have done that. Okay. I'm good.
[5508.78s -> 5526.39s]  Like I really fucked up, but he's still alive. Why are we so good? We're all like the 11 year
[5526.39s -> 5546.76s]  olds that fall instantly. Come on. Are we all 30? Yeah, I think so. Probably fall off. Somebody
[5546.76s -> 5550.92s]  fall off. Somebody fall. There's only two more people need to fall. Fall.
[5557.99s -> 5568.34s]  Oh shit. All right. One more. We're good. Yes. It's kind of sad, but this game is
[5569.06s -> 5579.30s]  all like 30 year olds and we all think that everybody else is 10. I never thought about it
[5579.30s -> 5597.91s]  like that. Why can't we just have fun? Yeah. Why does it matter? That doesn't matter. Just
[5597.91s -> 5606.97s]  why can't we just have a good time? No, no fun. I don't like this one.
[5608.70s -> 5626.87s]  But all right. I got that off. I got that off you. Am I fucking this up? I think I'm
[5626.87s -> 5631.75s]  fucking this up. I might be messing this up for us. I'm like throwing them and they're bouncing back.
[5635.08s -> 5643.13s]  Get the golden egg. All right. We've got more blue over here. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good.
[5646.09s -> 5658.86s]  Get it in there. Good. Good. Okay. Back in the game. How much is a gold egg worth?
[5659.74s -> 5662.38s]  No. Are we going to be the team that everybody comes and just ruins?
[5663.34s -> 5676.12s]  No. I'll be defense. Fine. Get eggs in here. I'm defending this place with my fucking life guys.
[5676.92s -> 5699.21s]  Call me. Oh my God. We're so bad. This is awful. This is so bad. What do I do?
[5699.93s -> 5710.68s]  What am I supposed to do? We lose. It's over. We couldn't even get one egg to stay here.
[5710.68s -> 5740.23s]  I'll be the only guy that has one egg. What do you mean toxic? That wasn't toxic.
[5741.64s -> 5757.91s]  It was zero seconds left. Toxic. You could have won. We had two points. The people in second place
[5757.91s -> 5771.53s]  had 21. Am I going to play Minecraft today? No. Probably not going to play Minecraft for another
[5771.53s -> 5776.01s]  year. That's not true. FTK is happening in like two weeks. Sorry about that. Never mind.
[5776.81s -> 5786.62s]  Only three weeks or something. Oh, I want to make sure I say this. If you,
[5787.18s -> 5793.64s]  the reason why the DLC movie night was going to be the end of August is because when I,
[5793.64s -> 5798.33s]  I didn't really give anybody a cutoff date. I did that stream and then disappeared for two
[5798.33s -> 5805.30s]  and a half months. So now on the 23rd, that's the last time you can submit anything and please go
[5805.30s -> 5817.78s]  check out the rules. What? I got banned? No, I didn't. Am I in low priority queue? What happened?
[5818.34s -> 5847.74s]  I didn't get actually banned. Did I? No. Good. All right. I got to focus. I'm just going to put
[5847.74s -> 5874.55s]  on focus music. Uh, I, I got it. I'll do it after this. You got to go with the flow with these.
[5876.15s -> 5895.67s]  Okay. Sick. All right. Well, I'm going this way. Don't fire. Don't fire. Don't fire. Good.
[5899.86s -> 5918.09s]  Epic. Oh my God. This is so epic. Stop diving. I can't help it. I'm sorry.
[5918.09s -> 5939.11s]  That guy was just wanted to go. He didn't want anything to do with that.
[5940.23s -> 5944.52s]  You see looking at how, but what flavor would that guy be? That guy would be like this weird
[5944.52s -> 5953.50s]  raspberry cotton candy and shit. This would be like licorice, uh, mint, watermelon. They don't
[5953.50s -> 5958.14s]  have, they have all those flavors. What other flavors would you add? They have all these,
[5958.14s -> 5960.54s]  every single one of these could be a flavor. They have it in Jelly Belly.
[5961.50s -> 5979.98s]  I don't switch the subject. You're toxic. Yeah. You want to see toxic? I'll show you toxic.
[6001.69s -> 6007.11s]  Everyone just waiting with just clenched. Oh, what's he going to do? He's going to look wicked.
[6007.11s -> 6010.31s]  Fucked up. No, I don't give a shit. I'm just playing the game.
[6045.50s -> 6053.34s]  He like shook me off a little and I was, I was holding up on the
[6053.98s -> 6065.56s]  controller thinking he would go off. I'm fucking smashing my hand. Okay. I have to, I need focus
[6065.56s -> 6070.25s]  music. I don't even know what focus music is right now. I don't know. Like a dial tone.
[6070.25s -> 6090.26s]  Why can I not hear this? Why can't I hear that? I can't hear it. You can.
[6102.09s -> 6105.37s]  What's the first thing you think about when you want to focus? Um,
[6106.09s -> 6118.87s]  first thing that I want to focus on is the first thing. Um, energy, like body energy.
[6123.21s -> 6131.53s]  Not, uh, not anything too loud or. Oh, no, no, no. I just, just, just body energy, body heat.
[6131.53s -> 6133.93s]  That's what I think of when I think of like, well, how do you focus body heat?
[6135.21s -> 6152.47s]  Is there a song like, or the thing that, okay, body heat. How about Halloween farts three?
[6152.47s -> 6172.60s]  That's not a real song. And that's, I mean, maybe it is. Why is it Halloween? What's the
[6172.60s -> 6177.16s]  difference between a Halloween fart and a Christmas fart? I think I did the both the same thing.
[6178.70s -> 6194.22s]  Did you put one through an echo filter with like a pitch shift on it? He needs to center his chi.
[6194.22s -> 6197.66s]  All right. I hate this one. This one's too easy just to blow up and just lose.
[6199.50s -> 6219.78s]  Where do you think you're going? Back off.
[6226.33s -> 6230.41s]  All right. Now defense. Click the link coward. I'm in the middle of a,
[6230.41s -> 6234.65s]  of a battle Royale where every second counts. I can't click on the link right now.
[6234.65s -> 6240.42s]  Oh, and somebody just stole a golden goose from us. All right. I got,
[6241.38s -> 6245.14s]  there's two eggs over here. I got to start fighting. Just grab somebody.
[6252.23s -> 6263.77s]  Good. Don't be in last place. All right. That's good. Just defend. No one's paying attention.
[6265.77s -> 6273.98s]  Wrong guy. Oh no, they're all coming in. They're all coming in. They're all coming in our zone.
[6274.38s -> 6303.70s]  Hey, why is everybody standing around? 19 seconds. We're good. No, that's not. That's one of my
[6303.70s -> 6322.87s]  friends. Okay. All of blue team is in the red base. We did it. Toxic team kill. All right.
[6322.87s -> 6329.32s]  What do you want me to click? Why can I not hear this though? That's annoying.
[6335.14s -> 6349.72s]  Nobody just uploaded this. Somebody just uploaded this or they just titled something differently.
[6349.72s -> 6352.76s]  This is Halloween farts three. How is this? What does it mean to do with farting?
[6353.64s -> 6365.43s]  I don't understand. Wait, soccer. All right. All right. Let's go. I just fucked it up for
[6365.43s -> 6388.10s]  everybody. I just ruined everything. What? Pretty good shot. All right. Line it up. Bounce it over
[6388.10s -> 6413.75s]  here. I know that they did this. I know they did this in soccer. Watch this. Get it in there.
[6415.21s -> 6444.30s]  Now they're in trouble. Four to one. It's going to double. Get it in. Nice. I set that up.
[6444.30s -> 6453.51s]  I set that up big time. Good setup. This is bad. Blue is kind of getting destroyed.
[6456.60s -> 6460.12s]  Just whatever. No, no. Don't go chase it. We're up by six points.
[6461.64s -> 6466.07s]  Don't go chasing it. Where's the goalie? Oh, somebody's screaming right now.
[6467.91s -> 6480.65s]  I'm going to bounce back this way. Watch. I'm going to head it in there. Thank you.
[6492.78s -> 6507.70s]  Yes. Come on. Do it. Yes. No. We got to get to 10 points. Wow. That was an across the 11.
[6508.74s -> 6515.30s]  This is just sad. How come a bunch of them didn't leave like I did? Are they not children like I am?
[6515.86s -> 6535.24s]  Damn. There's only nine people. There's like an 11% chance that I just win just because I exist.
[6535.24s -> 6571.56s]  This is awesome. Okay. I'm going to let them bump their heads. Not mine.
[6574.86s -> 6593.19s]  I'm going to hit that toucan up there. Get hit. Hit him. Hit him. Hit him. Hit him. He's going to
[6593.19s -> 6595.27s]  miss. He's going to miss. Watch this. He's going to miss. He's not going to get it. He's going to
[6595.27s -> 6638.09s]  miss. I hate this game. Pigeon? Sure. Put it on. I'm the Toronto Blue Jays. Cool. I like it.
[6650.86s -> 6657.11s]  Why would I play the Halloween album again? I'm trying to find out where there are parts.
[6657.11s -> 6673.74s]  It's just every haunted house I've ever been to. There's nothing there. Wait. What? Wait.
[6675.35s -> 6680.01s]  Oh no. I've had wrong audio. I've had fucked up audio the whole stream.
[6681.05s -> 6690.97s]  Yep. My audio has been completely toast the entire stream. So I have a pair of headphones
[6690.97s -> 6694.73s]  that I have an extender for. That extender, for some reason, when I plug the headphones
[6694.73s -> 6699.61s]  into the extender, if it's not just right, it can really just screw up the entire audio.
[6700.41s -> 6703.61s]  We have muffled and shitty sounding and I feel like wiggle it around a little.
[6705.40s -> 6710.63s]  So it actually, I cannot hear what's going on there. I feel like wiggle the thing around.
[6712.39s -> 6733.46s]  Wait. Don't fall for that. Is that not true?
[6734.42s -> 6738.42s]  That really is a problem that I have and it looked like it wasn't plugged in all the way.
[6740.02s -> 6749.82s]  Oh, this is you guys are just fucking around. Oh, okay. So one of you just made this and
[6749.90s -> 6774.57s]  uploaded it. Oh, this video was uploaded in 2015. Let's see who comes in.
[6775.45s -> 6779.54s]  I'm going to try to ruin somebody's day. I'm going to try to be 41.
[6784.78s -> 6790.47s]  Is that toxic? Now I'm going to watch the guy just desperately coming and I'm going to just
[6790.47s -> 6797.54s]  walk over right when he gets right here. Is it toxic? Isn't that just part of like the
[6797.54s -> 6819.10s]  jelly bean game? That's what you, I can do this. It's toxic. I saw that right side over there.
[6819.10s -> 6827.13s]  There was like 10 people. So I'm like, no, I'm not. All right. This guy right here is doing it.
[6827.13s -> 6840.38s]  Let's see if he gets it. 37. No, where is he? Oh, I'll be a coward in that scenario. That's fine.
[6841.26s -> 6853.98s]  But on calming Fortnite music, I have to like turn the music off on this.
[6853.98s -> 6883.10s]  What is calming Fortnite music? Fortnite has a soundtrack. It does. It has a soundtrack.
[6883.10s -> 6885.50s]  But yeah, but is it something that people like actually listen to?
[6885.50s -> 6906.41s]  No. Why is this left one not going down ever again?
[6908.41s -> 6923.91s]  You saw that. What the hell was that? All right. I, that was stupid.
[6923.91s -> 6928.15s]  The thing stayed up with five rotations. All right. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out.
[6928.95s -> 6940.81s]  I'll put on the Fortnite song. What is it? Where's the, where's the Fortnite song?
[6940.81s -> 6956.10s]  No, that's why my BRB. Preston. Fortnite music, the calm before the storm.
[6957.26s -> 6966.36s]  Is this going to work? Uh, go back. What am I doing? Okay. Let's
[6969.22s -> 6982.65s]  Relaxing gaming music, Fortnite OST. This is not haunted house music. This sounds like Halloween
[6982.65s -> 7013.94s]  music. I'm going to get a DMCA from Fortnite. What? Really? Okay. No music. Just only my breath.
[7013.94s -> 7028.87s]  That's all you're going to get. No, people are going to hate that. That's not funny.
[7028.87s -> 7031.27s]  That's just people. Like a thousand of you believe if I do that.
[7031.27s -> 7051.34s]  All right. I got to pay attention. I have to come in first. Why does this guy have the same clothes
[7051.34s -> 7057.94s]  on? That's always the worst thing in the world. You go to a Halloween party and you hope to God
[7057.94s -> 7066.10s]  that nobody else has the, I'm the adult, the adult doctor costume thing on the bag and two other
[7066.10s -> 7081.22s]  people at the party have the like nurse bag costume. What do you mean? Huh? You go to a
[7081.22s -> 7084.74s]  Halloween party and somebody's wearing the same costume that they got it out of the bag from the
[7084.74s -> 7098.02s]  like the party store. Like the costume is in a bag. Nobody understand what I'm saying.
[7099.22s -> 7107.75s]  When you go to a Halloween party and everyone's dressed up and a bunch of those people there got
[7107.75s -> 7113.66s]  their Halloween costume 40 minutes before the party and they got it out of a bag. It's just a
[7113.66s -> 7124.10s]  bag. It's got a hat, a little thing for a mask, a suit. Uh, it's just a bag costume. I know what
[7124.10s -> 7133.78s]  he said. Yeah. Wow. Why is this so bizarre? Have you guys ever been into a party store in your entire
[7133.78s -> 7140.74s]  life? You know how they have just the wall of just pre-made ready to go, just costumes in the bag.
[7140.74s -> 7163.58s]  I'm getting trolled here. What is a party store? This stuff still exists. This doesn't like something
[7163.58s -> 7171.37s]  from like the forties. This is a, the bag costume and it's Wolverine and the, the legs,
[7171.93s -> 7176.98s]  the pants are so short that they end up being like Capri's. You get like a shitty Wolverine
[7176.98s -> 7183.78s]  mask that covers half of the top part of your face. And for some reason, the arms are so baggy.
[7184.50s -> 7199.86s]  I've worn them before. It doesn't even come claws. I was in a good position until I got hit.
[7200.42s -> 7206.98s]  Okay. I'm just, what RNG is this? I'm getting hit by every single fucking one of these.
[7207.54s -> 7229.18s]  It's the music. I need music. What can I put on for music? That's not going to get my channel
[7229.18s -> 7236.66s]  fucking terminated. Am I going to have to make my own music to listen to on stream?
[7237.30s -> 7248.47s]  But on the Tekken 4 OST. All right. Now you're talking. I don't even know what this is.
[7252.55s -> 7260.10s]  Damn it. I want to play this one. Not fair. This one looks so cool. Tekken 4 full soundtrack.
[7260.10s -> 7279.56s]  This one looks fun. Have I ever seen that one? I had a shot at that honeycomb level and I really
[7279.56s -> 7291.69s]  blew it. I'm so sad. I'm going to get DMCA'd by Tekken. Not, that's not going to happen.
[7291.69s -> 7318.60s]  This is pretty perfect gaming music. Louder. It sounds like I just grabbed, this is right in the
[7318.60s -> 7343.82s]  middle of a drum solo. Oh, these sounds ruin it. No, you can't even hear it. I'll fix it.
[7344.62s -> 7368.87s]  Let's keep the momentum going. Everyone's going to be fine. Play Gex? I don't know what that is.
[7373.18s -> 7380.06s]  Shit. Shit. Shit. No, no, no, no. Don't. Please. I was the last motherfucker to cross
[7380.06s -> 7400.73s]  that finish line. All right. How do I put Gex? Please don't. Don't. That's actually going to get
[7400.73s -> 7421.14s]  me in trouble. Okay. This is just what happens when the DJ is setting up his shit. He hasn't
[7421.14s -> 7431.83s]  started doing anything yet. He doesn't start for another 15 minutes. Never play 100 Gex. It's awful.
[7431.83s -> 7451.58s]  I don't even know what that is. I don't know. I'll listen to it off screen. Oh, shit. Barely getting
[7451.58s -> 7474.70s]  these. Oh, dear. Oh, why? No, dude. It hit me with everything. It hit me every single time.
[7475.42s -> 7537.62s]  You hope I get banned. I lost. This song's kind of scary.
[7566.38s -> 7570.30s]  I feel like I have to be on drugs staring up at the ceiling for this song to make sense.
[7572.12s -> 7577.32s]  This is a main character just did drugs and is lying on bed staring at ceiling.
[7578.28s -> 7611.11s]  Way too loud. This one. Do this one. This one. I can't play things that are copyright claim.
[7611.11s -> 7623.32s]  You're going to get me in big trouble. This is hog. Fortnite. The end lobby music. I don't.
[7624.28s -> 7630.60s]  I don't want to listen. I don't care. I just, I just really, I'm just going to be honest with
[7630.60s -> 7637.62s]  you. I just, I don't, I don't care about Fortnite at all. Like I really just don't. I don't. I'm
[7637.62s -> 7645.70s]  just going to be completely honest with you. I have to be. Play this. It's not copyright.

[7654.02s -> 7657.54s]  I lose this every time. I don't think I've won this once in the two times I've seen it.
[7658.10s -> 7670.17s]  Wait, I'm on blue team. I figured out what they are, but they're Pikmin by the way.
[7670.17s -> 7685.58s]  I can't even see the chat right now. As long as you're not in the last place, it doesn't matter.
[7686.30s -> 7702.38s]  All right. Can we seriously break this up? This is bullshit. No one's paying attention to this one.
[7702.46s -> 7708.98s]  Four. Keep it over here. Don't push it out. Don't push it out. Don't push it out.

[9824.57s -> 9828.82s]  it's a stealth game you gotta you gotta like break people's necks behind them and there's like a
[9828.82s -> 9844.92s]  shooter and stuff it's like a shooting game right like third person first person perfect game yeah
[9846.58s -> 9853.19s]  you should play fall guys it really sucks that the one that i'm potentially going out on

[9929.29s -> 9933.29s]  campaign and just made it another game kind of a weird development story actually
[9934.09s -> 9950.26s]  and let me actually just see this do i get a crown when you start streaming five hours later
[9950.26s -> 9964.57s]  tomorrow i will probably start tomorrow around 11 to 12 pacific probably like 11 servers are still
