[0.70s -> 5.46s]  Hey, what's going on everybody? Jerma here with an update video.
[5.46s -> 11.06s]  I felt the need to make this video because of various developments going on in my channel in my life.
[11.06s -> 17.40s]  So we're going to talk. I don't have any gameplay. I haven't recorded much gameplay since like four or five months ago.
[17.40s -> 23.29s]  So in the background of this video is probably just going to be Spider-Man. You cool with that?
[23.29s -> 31.08s]  You don't want Spider-Man. Okay, but how about Spider-Man 2? Yeah, I knew I'd get you with Spider-Man 2.
[31.99s -> 35.91s]  So if you want to listen, you go ahead. And if you don't, then you've probably already left.
[35.91s -> 41.42s]  And I don't know why I'm even addressing that person because they've been gone for probably the last 10 to 15 seconds.
[41.42s -> 48.49s]  So I will address the elephant in the room, which is my uploads over the last couple of months.
[48.49s -> 53.37s]  I'm sure you're well aware there's only been like three uploads to this channel in two months.
[53.37s -> 56.09s]  And that's something that I'm not particularly happy about.
[56.09s -> 61.75s]  I obviously want to make as many videos, make as many videos that I'm proud of that I want you guys to watch.
[61.75s -> 68.79s]  Try to get as much videos and content up as possible. But sometimes, sometimes you need to collect yourself,
[68.79s -> 75.11s]  take a break, and reiterate inside your head why you do these things, why you make these videos,
[75.11s -> 80.09s]  what you're doing it for, who you're doing it for, and are you still interested.
[80.09s -> 85.88s]  And that's a very important point that I want to make. Very, very first off, before we talk about anything else,
[85.88s -> 92.04s]  I have to stay interested. We could talk about money and power and the fame and the fans and
[92.04s -> 100.97s]  how fuh-wow. Kiss my hand. Now kneel. I don't, no, I just, I need to stay interested. I have to be
[101.53s -> 107.32s]  completely and totally into the thing that I'm currently working on. I've never been able to just
[107.32s -> 112.92s]  force myself to upload something. Even back when I was uploading a shitload of videos years ago,
[112.92s -> 117.64s]  I was totally fucking into it. I wanted, I was so into making those videos every day because I was
[117.64s -> 124.63s]  currently so into the subject matter. And lately, I've been into certain subject matters that take
[124.63s -> 130.95s]  way more time to come up with and way more time to produce, which we can segue into talking about
[130.95s -> 137.19s]  the next subject I want to bring up. And it's a huge video that I've been working on. I've wanted
[137.19s -> 142.15s]  to make this video for about a year and it's currently taking up a bunch of my mental energy
[142.15s -> 148.47s]  and spare time and money and effort is gonna be huge. And it's gonna come out this summer.
[148.47s -> 153.13s]  I don't want to talk about what it is. I'm sure people can piece together the stupid fucking things
[153.13s -> 157.37s]  I've said on live streams to be able to piece together what it is. And I've told some people
[157.37s -> 162.41s]  what it is. If I've told you, if you're one of the people I've told, just keep zipping, you know
[162.41s -> 167.05s]  what I mean? Just keep it up. You're a secret keeper now. You've been elevated to the status
[167.05s -> 172.97s]  of secret keeper. That doesn't happen very often, especially in my circle of acolytes that I have
[172.97s -> 179.77s]  here. So if I've told you, just you know what to do. So stay tuned for that. It's coming. You'll see
[179.77s -> 185.10s]  it when you see it and I really hope you guys enjoy it because it is a legit just like love
[185.10s -> 192.39s]  letter to you guys. And without getting overly sappy or emotional in this video, it's for you.
[192.39s -> 197.91s]  This video is for you. I've had this idea that I thought people would really, really be into
[197.91s -> 203.30s]  and it's just a total concentration of all the stupid shit that's been going on on this channel
[203.30s -> 209.22s]  for five years. And I hope you guys really enjoy it when you see it. And that's pretty much all I
[209.22s -> 212.55s]  got to say about that subject. We're going to move on to the next one, which is streaming,
[212.55s -> 217.99s]  which I got to be careful of because every single time I talk about streaming in a video,
[217.99s -> 222.50s]  I curse myself and I don't stream for like three months. So let's hope that doesn't happen right
[222.50s -> 227.06s]  now because I've been streaming a lot lately. These last like four months, I've been going
[227.14s -> 231.22s]  a couple of times a week, sometimes more than that. Sometimes like four, five, six, seven,
[231.22s -> 238.02s]  eight hour streams. I streamed all of Dark Souls 3. I streamed a bunch of Stardew Valley. I did
[238.02s -> 242.10s]  Doom a couple of days ago. I've been streaming Overwatch as shit load. I've been on there a lot
[242.10s -> 246.60s]  and it's something that I'm having a ton of fun doing. So if you still have not followed my Twitch
[246.60s -> 254.25s]  and you're into that and you like streaming, then come on over. And if you're not, if you really just
[254.25s -> 258.66s]  hate live streaming, you don't like watching live streams, then there is a little bit of good
[258.66s -> 263.06s]  news here for you too, because all the streams that I do, at least the major ones that have
[264.10s -> 269.70s]  substantial amount of content in them will be broken up and they will be uploaded as highlights
[269.70s -> 275.08s]  to YouTube. Now I don't know if that's going to be this channel or if I'd make a separate channel
[275.08s -> 280.44s]  entirely for stream content. I don't know, but I don't like the idea of putting whole streams up
[280.44s -> 285.96s]  on YouTube because they are currently on Twitch right now. You can watch entire VODs on Twitch
[285.96s -> 291.82s]  right now. So I don't want to do that. I'd rather have, oh, you played through Dark Souls 3. Here's
[291.82s -> 296.46s]  like two or three videos condensed of all like the best moments from when you were streaming.
[296.46s -> 301.82s]  That's what I'm into. I'm just not sure exactly when it will happen, but I would assume in the
[301.82s -> 306.97s]  next couple of months here is when it would start to be a thing. And finally, we're going to talk
[306.97s -> 311.35s]  about my book. That's right. You didn't think you were going to ever hear that shit again,
[311.35s -> 315.14s]  did you? About my book that I'm writing. If you have no idea what I'm talking about,
[315.14s -> 319.94s]  if you're fairly new to the channel or if you're an old subscriber that forgot because it's been
[319.94s -> 325.70s]  so damn long, I wanted to try to make a choose your own adventure book, write it and come up
[325.70s -> 329.62s]  with some stupid ideas, put it in like a medieval fantasy world and you get to pick different things
[329.62s -> 334.02s]  to do. And it was going to be free. I was never going to charge for it. I was going to just release
[334.02s -> 339.18s]  it because I'm using the Inkle writer to write it. And there's been progress. I actually started
[339.18s -> 342.54s]  writing again. I stopped and I started and I stopped and I started and now I'm finally
[342.54s -> 347.50s]  writing again. And it's become kind of like therapy to me. You know, whatever I feel,
[347.50s -> 351.10s]  I fucking today sucks. You know what, I'm just gonna sit down and I'm going to write like two
[351.10s -> 356.23s]  chapters and I don't know. We'll see what happens. I have no idea if this is ever going to get
[356.23s -> 362.63s]  finished. Another like six to 12 months might go by and I might just throw it up onto Twitter
[363.19s -> 367.11s]  and have everybody just enjoy the fucking mess that it's probably going to be.
[367.67s -> 372.31s]  So that's the update on that. And that really wraps it up. That's all I really wanted to talk
[372.31s -> 377.27s]  about today. Just want to make sure you guys know I'm still around. I'm still kicking. I still get
[377.27s -> 382.65s]  a bunch of shit up my sleeve, but a magician never reveals his secrets except to like a few people,
[382.65s -> 387.46s]  except maybe like 30 people that I've already told the secret to. So he does reveal his secrets only
[387.46s -> 391.06s]  due to a very small amount of people. Anyways guys, thanks so much for watching. I really
[391.06s -> 394.18s]  appreciate it. Have a good rest of your day. Have a good rest of your morning, night, evening,
[394.18s -> 399.48s]  whatever the hell you're watching this video. And I'll talk to you guys soon. So take care everybody
[399.48s -> 400.04s]  and goodbye.
