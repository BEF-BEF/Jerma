[10191.82s -> 10200.57s]  I don't know, what the fuck
[10200.57s -> 10203.30s]  I don't know

[10205.30s -> 10214.46s]  something going on, I don't know what's going on

[10296.76s -> 10300.09s]  that would be really
[10300.09s -> 10302.09s]  stupid to do that in real life
[10302.09s -> 10311.16s]  face devs
[10311.16s -> 10313.16s]  go back to the rope, go back to the rope
[10313.16s -> 10315.16s]  go back to the rope, go back to the rope

[10347.26s -> 10349.75s]  what do we do
[10349.75s -> 10357.99s]  burn the rope
[10357.99s -> 10370.54s]  I tried that already, they're not working
[10370.54s -> 10373.99s]  saw two waiting to grab it at the bottom
[10373.99s -> 10383.98s]  it's part of the scary movie thing
[10383.98s -> 10386.34s]  that's supposed to be happening

[10763.90s -> 10765.90s]  moments where if that was a little kid
[10765.90s -> 10767.90s]  it didn't hurt that much but it hurt just enough

[11756.36s -> 11778.31s]  it's me, the comedy guy
[11778.31s -> 11780.74s]  I made up that scream to make you cry
[11780.74s -> 11782.74s]  it's me, the comedy guy
[11782.74s -> 11784.74s]  you thought I was scared
[11784.74s -> 11786.74s]  why don't you die
[11786.74s -> 11790.71s]  not you, that guy
[11790.71s -> 11797.86s]  why
[11797.86s -> 11801.26s]  that was fucking horrible
[11801.26s -> 11808.04s]  that's the worst
[11808.04s -> 11810.04s]  Dr. Seuss book
[11810.04s -> 11812.47s]  that was the worst scare
[11812.47s -> 11821.30s]  of the whole game, comedy guy is the worst
[11821.30s -> 11828.02s]  character, here's the best part
[11828.02s -> 11830.02s]  about that, I can't see what you guys
[11830.02s -> 11832.02s]  are writing in real time, so I don't know if you
[11832.02s -> 11834.02s]  hate it or not, I'm just
[11834.02s -> 11837.99s]  you know what
[11837.99s -> 11849.30s]  oh why
[11849.30s -> 11851.30s]  we love comedy guy, oh yes
[11851.30s -> 11857.32s]  I'm so happy
[11857.32s -> 11859.32s]  I actually lost like two years
[11859.32s -> 11861.32s]  of my life from that one
[11861.32s -> 11863.32s]  it just sprinted right into my face
[11863.32s -> 11865.62s]  oh my god
[11865.62s -> 11868.82s]  I feel terrible
[11868.82s -> 11870.82s]  right now, I feel like somebody just punched me in the face
[11870.82s -> 11877.99s]  like five times
[11877.99s -> 11888.62s]  alright, get me out of here
[11888.62s -> 11891.43s]  I need a torch
[11891.43s -> 11897.70s]  alright, I can't see shit in there
[11912.92s -> 11920.98s]  bones here
[11920.98s -> 11923.16s]  god save me
[11923.16s -> 11927.38s]  I'll do it myself
[11927.38s -> 11945.69s]  oh look, that's what the rope
[11945.69s -> 11947.69s]  is there for, rope reveal
[11947.69s -> 11949.69s]  fog
[11949.69s -> 11953.38s]  fog
[11953.38s -> 11957.74s]  no, no
[11957.74s -> 11959.74s]  that's arguably more important
[11959.74s -> 11984.70s]  I want that cross
[11984.70s -> 11991.98s]  let's get on this boat
[11991.98s -> 12000.23s]  on down, I move the boat
[12000.23s -> 12006.55s]  the fake bridge
[12006.55s -> 12008.55s]  I swear to god, Jeremy
[12008.55s -> 12010.55s]  oh
[12010.55s -> 12016.76s]  we're good
[12016.76s -> 12023.27s]  we're good
[12023.27s -> 12026.09s]  so fake bridge here
[12026.09s -> 12038.68s]  oh, you just row
[12038.68s -> 12045.85s]  are we going?
[12045.85s -> 12051.74s]  oh, this is the bad part
[12051.74s -> 12053.74s]  this is father Phineas battle
[12053.74s -> 12055.74s]  of sanctism to Paul
[12055.74s -> 12059.50s]  if you listen to this
[12059.50s -> 12061.50s]  I expect that Pazuzu has already
[12061.50s -> 12063.50s]  stayed in my mind
[12063.50s -> 12065.50s]  I will not let him
[12065.50s -> 12067.50s]  do the same to you
[12067.50s -> 12069.50s]  you must finish
[12069.50s -> 12071.80s]  my work
[12071.80s -> 12073.80s]  however lucid his savage visions
[12073.80s -> 12075.80s]  however piercing his violent threats
[12075.80s -> 12077.80s]  he must be
[12077.80s -> 12079.80s]  stopped
[12079.80s -> 12081.80s]  his flame must be extinguished
[12081.80s -> 12083.80s]  and his presence expelled from the tomb
[12083.80s -> 12086.30s]  it is the only way
[12086.30s -> 12088.30s]  and he's gonna be like
[12088.30s -> 12100.95s]  right?
[12100.95s -> 12102.95s]  I see something up there
[12102.95s -> 12105.32s]  put the torch down
[12105.32s -> 12123.50s]  there's light, too much light
[12123.50s -> 12130.52s]  what the fuck is that?
[12130.52s -> 12132.52s]  oh shit, that's Pazuzu
[12132.52s -> 12134.52s]  that's the Pazuzu statue from the first chapter
[12154.50s -> 12157.64s]  it's gonna be a tongue
[12157.64s -> 12159.64s]  it's gonna be a giant frog
[12159.64s -> 12161.64s]  this is a tongue
[12161.64s -> 12165.10s]  that's a tongue
[12165.10s -> 12175.98s]  thank god it's not a fucking guy's tongue
[12175.98s -> 12181.67s]  we gotta go up to Lord Pazuzu's
[12181.67s -> 12191.91s]  temple
[12191.91s -> 12195.24s]  come on, man, let's go
[12195.24s -> 12218.71s]  this way
[12218.71s -> 12224.97s]  oh, I climbed this
[12224.97s -> 12227.21s]  we gotta lose the torch
[12227.21s -> 12232.78s]  alright, bye
[12232.78s -> 12244.09s]  okay, here we go, holy water
[12244.09s -> 12248.70s]  holy water, and then bring the demon out
[12248.70s -> 12303.98s]  here we go
[12303.98s -> 12324.33s]  undo it
[12342.95s -> 12344.95s]  through the
[12344.95s -> 12346.95s]  floorboards
[12346.95s -> 12348.95s]  you think humanity
[12348.95s -> 12350.95s]  deserves to thrive
[12350.95s -> 12352.95s]  in its own
[12352.95s -> 12354.95s]  rotting decay
[12354.95s -> 12356.95s]  that's the wolf from the never ending story
[12356.95s -> 12359.13s]  that I should not indulge
[12359.13s -> 12361.13s]  in humanity's madness
[12361.13s -> 12366.55s]  let you
[12366.55s -> 12368.55s]  such an holy slime
[12368.55s -> 12370.55s]  carry on the gods
[12370.55s -> 12377.34s]  back! stay back!
[12377.34s -> 12380.09s]  I will use
[12380.09s -> 12382.09s]  how I knew that you have never seen
[12382.09s -> 12384.09s]  before of the thousands of years
[12384.09s -> 12388.76s]  you don't scare me
[12388.76s -> 12390.76s]  vile demon
[12390.76s -> 12393.13s]  if you think I'm going to be
[12393.13s -> 12395.13s]  terrified by something as vile
[12395.13s -> 12397.13s]  as you, you have been mistaken
[12397.13s -> 12399.94s]  now come down here and face me
[12399.94s -> 12401.94s]  and face the light
[12401.94s -> 12418.82s]  face the light
[12418.82s -> 12420.82s]  once that cracks into twelve o'clock
[12420.82s -> 12422.82s]  noon
[12422.82s -> 12424.82s]  you will be vanquished from this earth
[12424.82s -> 12428.86s]  once and for all
[12428.86s -> 12430.86s]  once and for all
[12430.86s -> 12432.86s]  get a little scared
[12432.86s -> 12442.01s]  but it's okay
[12442.01s -> 12446.17s]  stay right there
[12446.17s -> 12448.98s]  it's time I accept
[12448.98s -> 12450.98s]  that you are of any
[12450.98s -> 12452.98s]  species
[12452.98s -> 12454.98s]  no, no I will not accept
[12454.98s -> 12461.90s]  it
[12461.90s -> 12465.74s]  right, no I don't need to spread

[12587.70s -> 12589.70s]  look at it, stare at it, stare at it
[12589.70s -> 12591.70s]  Jesus he'll help you
[12591.70s -> 12593.70s]  you helplessly follow as others
[12593.70s -> 12595.70s]  come

[12597.70s -> 12602.23s]  however their victims
[12602.23s -> 12604.41s]  this is a new beginning
[12604.41s -> 12607.46s]  detective
[12607.46s -> 12613.91s]  you will be there
[12613.91s -> 12615.91s]  and you will watch as I disembowel
[12615.91s -> 12617.91s]  the remnants of your so called
[12617.91s -> 12621.56s]  humanity
[12621.56s -> 12633.19s]  join us
[12633.19s -> 12646.31s]  oh

[12662.74s -> 12668.38s]  will always prevail
[12668.38s -> 12670.38s]  ever sometimes when it doesn't

[12675.43s -> 12679.19s]  over, told you
[12679.19s -> 12681.19s]  everything that led me here crumbled to dust
[12681.19s -> 12683.19s]  around me, wait I can't read it
[12683.19s -> 12689.59s]  we can't hear you

[12710.09s -> 12712.09s]  oh it's not that exciting for you
[12712.09s -> 12714.33s]  it's exciting for me
[12714.33s -> 12716.33s]  right between, that's sick
[12716.33s -> 12718.33s]  doozoo's
[12718.33s -> 12720.33s]  running flush that lingered around me for months
[12720.33s -> 12736.38s]  let's talk about the real
[12736.38s -> 12739.19s]  that have been watching this stream
[12739.19s -> 12742.01s]  talk about the people that have been watching this stream
[12742.01s -> 12744.01s]  that didn't really know they were watching this stream
[12744.01s -> 12746.01s]  potentially my neighbors
[12746.01s -> 12748.01s]  think that there is some weird
[12748.01s -> 12750.01s]  really wild shit going on in this stream
[12750.01s -> 12752.76s]  performing exorcisms talking about like
[12752.76s -> 12754.76s]  slay the demon, go back to hell where you
[12754.76s -> 12756.76s]  belong, go back to where you came
[12756.76s -> 12758.76s]  eat holy water, like what am I doing in here
[12758.76s -> 12765.08s]  this is concerning
[12765.08s -> 12774.04s]  let's do this
[12774.04s -> 12776.04s]  alright that ending sequence
[12776.04s -> 12778.04s]  was pretty crazy, it was really good
[12778.04s -> 12780.22s]  75% I'll take it
[12780.22s -> 12782.22s]  what time is that by the way, that is
[12782.22s -> 12785.16s]  well would you look at that, it is
[12785.16s -> 12787.16s]  would be 11.10
[12787.16s -> 12801.59s]  11.10
[12801.59s -> 12803.59s]  alright let's uh
[12803.59s -> 12805.90s]  what are we doing, 11.05, 11.10
[12805.90s -> 12808.58s]  sorry I just punched you
[12808.58s -> 12824.89s]  is that
[12824.89s -> 12826.89s]  a zuzu in there
[12826.89s -> 12829.45s]  is this the chief
[12829.45s -> 12831.45s]  disgusting vile human
[12831.45s -> 12836.82s]  same like actor
[12836.82s -> 12843.10s]  oh this is cool, this is all the stuff
[12843.10s -> 12845.10s]  why wouldn't we want to get rid of this or something
[12845.10s -> 12849.19s]  I don't think we want to keep that
[12849.19s -> 12854.04s]  all my stuff, oh cool
[12854.04s -> 12865.88s]  this is all my things
[12865.88s -> 12868.57s]  that was fun, actually pretty good
[12868.57s -> 12871.00s]  I'm coming out
[12871.00s -> 12875.80s]  coming out, coming out
[12875.80s -> 12880.22s]  that was good, that was actually really fun
[12880.22s -> 12887.62s]  how's your hair, how's my face
[12887.62s -> 12890.44s]  don't worry about that
[12890.44s -> 12892.44s]  I'm more worried about like the 5
[12892.44s -> 12894.44s]  FPS camera that I have
[12894.44s -> 12901.27s]  next game, yeah we will
[12901.27s -> 12903.27s]  we're going to move on to the
[12903.27s -> 12906.66s]  actually hold on, I have the
[12906.66s -> 12908.66s]  walking dead, walking dead is coming up
[12908.66s -> 12913.14s]  next, either the walking dead or
[12913.14s -> 12916.92s]  what's a short one
[12916.92s -> 12918.92s]  I'm probably not going to go for more than probably another hour
[12918.92s -> 12924.54s]  what's a short one, I don't want
[12924.54s -> 12926.54s]  to do Five Nights at Freddy's, no, I played that game
[12926.54s -> 12928.54s]  I played that game in like 2012, I played them all
[12928.54s -> 12934.94s]  how about a chair
[12934.94s -> 12938.26s]  in a room, excuse me
[12938.26s -> 12941.53s]  you didn't do it in VR
[12941.53s -> 12945.05s]  you really don't
[12945.05s -> 12947.61s]  the VR one is better, the VR one is different
[12947.61s -> 12951.83s]  alright, how about this
[12951.83s -> 12953.83s]  we'll save that for Halloween night
[12953.83s -> 12955.83s]  but I'm going to play a chair in a room
[12955.83s -> 12957.83s]  it's probably not going to be very good, but it might be
[12957.83s -> 12959.83s]  let's have our expectations in the right place, don't you think
[12959.83s -> 12963.16s]  and then we'll do the walking dead as well
[12963.16s -> 12965.16s]  I'm going to play a bunch of scary random shit on Halloween night too
[12965.16s -> 12967.53s]  let me go just get some water
[12967.53s -> 12969.53s]  I'll be right back, see you in a minute
[12969.53s -> 12974.01s]  go back from which you came
