[1.08s -> 13.77s]  Hi guys, welcome. Welcome to a stream that is gonna be a little all over the place, I think.
[13.77s -> 24.15s]  This is gonna be interesting. You probably saw the title already. This is 700,000 games. No,
[24.15s -> 29.99s]  it is not 700,000 games from a couple years back, or a year and a half, or whatever it was.
[30.95s -> 40.82s]  This is the sequel. This is 700,000 games 2. I'm not just playing the old one. They did it
[40.82s -> 50.57s]  again. They did it again. They packed 700,000 more games into this teeny tiny little disc.
[51.45s -> 59.45s]  How do they even get it in there? So they, over the two versions, have 1.4 million games.
[60.17s -> 69.70s]  Oh, that coffee is very hot. I'm gonna let it sit there for a minute. But yeah, this is version
[69.70s -> 76.94s]  2. I've already gone through and looked at a few things and will touch upon them in just a
[77.02s -> 83.02s]  matter of mere minutes. So give me one second. I want to, I want to grab another
[83.02s -> 133.82s]  coaster. So give me one second. Be right back. Okay, so if we take a look at the box,
[133.82s -> 138.90s]  I'm going to show the box now because I want to be able to trickle in because this stream
[138.90s -> 144.57s]  is a fairly special stream. We're not going to be doing this that often, so. And by
[144.57s -> 150.68s]  often, I mean, we're going until this is done. I'm going to play every single one.
[151.24s -> 159.42s]  Like last time, if there's 700,000 games and I play each one for five minutes, that's
[160.14s -> 164.38s]  seven, 1.4 million, two, three, four. I got, that's, you're talking about probably three or
[164.38s -> 172.14s]  four years of the stream is going to be. So this is probably going to be three year, 20,
[172.14s -> 181.16s]  a 24 hour, three year long stream. So I'll see you guys when I'm like 40
[181.88s -> 189.13s]  and we get to the last one. So without further ado, why don't we go like this
[190.74s -> 202.63s]  and why don't we go like this? Hi. So here it is. 700,000 games version 2.0. One of the things
[202.63s -> 207.11s]  you're probably noticing right off the bat is the fact that the, the price tag has been
[207.11s -> 213.32s]  scratched off. I didn't do that. That came like this. And as we all know, there are only two
[213.32s -> 218.44s]  reasons why you do that. Either one, the gift was so cheap that you desperately don't want
[218.44s -> 222.92s]  the person to know that it was a piece of shit or you're embarrassed because the gift
[222.92s -> 233.61s]  was too expensive. And I wonder which one this is. Scratch off that price tag. It's a gift. I don't
[233.61s -> 241.29s]  want you to know how much this was. Both. Now, can you, I don't know. Maybe the company is
[241.29s -> 249.26s]  embarrassed that this was like $11 on Amazon, wherever the hell it is. But yeah, here you go.
[249.26s -> 255.35s]  I'll give you a close up. That's, you see pyramid escape up there. Can't wait for that one.
[256.65s -> 260.97s]  Uh, Mini Golf 3D Mania. Something interesting to know about 3D Golf Mini Mania.
[261.53s -> 266.57s]  Uh, there's a thousand and one Mini Golf Mania levels, which is included in a game. So that's
[266.57s -> 270.89s]  a thousand and one different games. They're using a weird semantic literal definition.
[272.02s -> 279.32s]  And oddly enough, that took about 40 minutes to install. Something else that's kind of
[279.32s -> 286.38s]  funny about this, before we get started, is I did open some of these and why don't we just,
[286.38s -> 297.59s]  I'll just show you. Uh, this is the same exact thing as the last one. Here's the difference.
[297.59s -> 304.39s]  Take a look at the, here, here, all of them. So you see those of you that watched the last
[304.39s -> 310.33s]  video that I did on the first version, I had a lot of problems not being able to open
[310.33s -> 317.14s]  a lot of these. So what this actually is, this is not 700,000 games too. This is 700,000
[317.14s -> 326.54s]  games. But this time, a bunch of them work. This is a patch. They patched in the ability to open
[326.54s -> 340.44s]  half the games you couldn't open last time. Sounds pretty good, doesn't it? Take a look.
[340.44s -> 347.72s]  We got hidden objects, arcade games, brickbuster games, time management games, marble popper,
[347.72s -> 354.07s]  card sports, match three, puzzles. Look at all these boring, terrible games that make up
[354.71s -> 366.71s]  699,990 of everything that's included on the one disc. So yeah, that, that's pretty much the long
[366.71s -> 370.23s]  and short of it. So what we're going to do is we're going to, we're going to do a little system
[370.23s -> 379.11s]  here. So I'm going to change this to this. I thought about turning on smart click. Uh,
[380.73s -> 385.64s]  there is no way smart click is going to work. You guys are going to have to, like,
[385.64s -> 391.38s]  pick a quadrant if I turn on smart click. There's no way. We will never choose a game. So
[391.38s -> 401.51s]  we're just going to start. We'll do smart click for like an encore at the end. Pick a quadrant,
[401.51s -> 409.29s]  then game. Smart click. I'm just curious of how awful this would be. So hold on,
[409.29s -> 416.01s]  give me one second. Let me change to this. I gotta get, where is it right there? It's copy.
[416.81s -> 423.77s]  So I can make sure I have that on over here. I'm, I'm just curious of how awful this would
[423.77s -> 436.55s]  be if I tried this. Okay. So without further ado, if, if we'd like to see how this is
[436.55s -> 442.36s]  going to work, uh, first I have to turn it on. You're going to have to refresh your page,
[442.36s -> 453.74s]  I think. Okay. It is now active and now I just have to go to it and turn it on.
[453.74s -> 455.98s]  So you're going to have to probably, if your extension is not there,
[456.70s -> 467.37s]  let's just see what happens. All right. That I super frog is where everybody,
[467.37s -> 473.03s]  it's actually working fairly well. This is not working terribly. This works actually pretty
[473.03s -> 480.70s]  well. I thought it was going to be a disaster. So we're starting with super frog.
[480.70s -> 486.90s]  Is that what this is? I'm surprised this works as well as does well. I'm shocked.
[498.44s -> 503.93s]  So it looks like we're going to start with a classic video game by the name of,
[505.03s -> 510.41s]  by the name of super frog. Thank you for your participation in this,
[511.46s -> 516.74s]  by the way, uh, need to make one more thing very clear. Uh, RIP to the whole stream.
[517.86s -> 521.86s]  I'll rip the VOD because we're going to be playing landmines.
[522.90s -> 526.58s]  Some of these are going to crash the entire computer and I'm going to have to restart my PC.
[527.22s -> 530.58s]  So good luck. Please don't, let's not click on the landmine
[533.19s -> 536.39s]  just through opening and closing certain ones. Oh, this is going to be a disaster.
[536.39s -> 544.20s]  Hope you, uh, welcome to the spring. Here we go. Let's go ahead and open super frog.
[544.20s -> 549.83s]  Let's get some nostalgia here. So I'm going to, I'm going to go away because I don't want
[549.83s -> 558.81s]  my face on the screen here, but what I do want is super frog. Yes. That's my desktop
[558.81s -> 564.58s]  background. And by the way, I have lowered the volume by like 50% and it's still going to be
[564.58s -> 567.78s]  awful. And when you might not even be able to see anything super frog here.
[568.34s -> 575.24s]  All right. This is important. I don't think I should do that. That, that, that might,
[575.80s -> 580.94s]  that's a, that's a, that's a risky click. You know what I mean? Whoa,
[580.94s -> 597.91s]  hold on a minute here. Risky click. Oh, come on. Come on. Oh, all right. Here it comes.
[597.91s -> 606.22s]  Look at how small this is. I have to make this better. Hold on. I knew I was going to
[606.22s -> 615.26s]  have to do this like a shit load of times and it's so loud. How does it know my name?
[616.06s -> 621.11s]  How does it know my name? I didn't click this. I promise. I didn't open this.
[621.99s -> 632.47s]  I want, I fucking promise. I did not open this game. It's a window. Hold on. Can you hear
[632.47s -> 640.06s]  me? All right. Throw bubble up joke. Okay. We're good. I can't wait. I'm so ready for
[640.06s -> 650.14s]  super frog. What a developer Easter egg. Yeah. Okay. Here we go. Time to play super frog.
[650.94s -> 657.74s]  You only got a taste last time of what this game was like. I had to,
[657.74s -> 663.32s]  I had to play through at least 20 minutes. There it is. Version two. Wait,
[663.32s -> 675.16s]  you can't even see this part. Yeah. We're going to have a lot of fun called every game is
[675.16s -> 680.62s]  going to open in a strange window and I'm going to have to resize them because I can't
[680.62s -> 689.91s]  resize them on the desktop. That's, there we go. All right. Collect all the flowers. Use the left
[689.91s -> 693.35s]  and right arrow keys to move in the appropriate direction to jump. Press the up arrow key to
[693.35s -> 697.59s]  collect the flowers in the middle of the screen. Reach the highest platform and then jump off of
[697.59s -> 712.44s]  it to the lower platforms using the arrow keys. Desktop background. What is that? I got
[712.44s -> 719.91s]  500 candies. Hey, welcome to the reference stream where I'm just going to make a bunch
[719.91s -> 731.32s]  of fucking references the whole time. Is this a different level? I thought, I thought it was
[731.32s -> 744.57s]  candies, not flowers. What the hell was that thing? This is the best song. You know, people
[744.57s -> 752.44s]  are like, oh put it on OST. This is the one that I want to listen to. I had to get the
[752.44s -> 759.08s]  banana. There's no double jump just in case you're curious. Just in case you're curious.
[761.72s -> 765.40s]  To enclose a monster in a bubble to trap it and then press the space bar to send it
[765.40s -> 775.26s]  flying. So it's like bubble bubble. How long should I spend on each one of these? There's
[775.26s -> 783.05s]  700,000 of these guys, remember. What just happened? I thought I put them in the bubble.
[783.05s -> 796.90s]  I have to pop the bubble. Oh, right. What if I only played Super Frogs? Would you guys be mad?
[811.46s -> 820.06s]  No, you guys wouldn't be mad if I only did Super Frog. I did it, right? Oh wait,
[820.06s -> 828.50s]  the flowers regrow. Oh, that's fucking new. Oh, here are the candies. Wait, is that?
[829.14s -> 844.98s]  Cockroach up. Oh, fuck. I'm beating the whole game. Restart. No, I'll get them again. Don't
[844.98s -> 852.18s]  worry. I'll say the line. Don't worry. You know what, I'm not going to say the line.
[853.06s -> 870.95s]  Say the line. Say the line. Oh, I should probably turn off the desktop background. Just
[870.95s -> 879.37s]  make it like a black screen, right? That's pretty quick. How many more do I have to do?
[879.37s -> 881.13s]  Hold on, let's see if I can get it how fast I can get this.
[882.01s -> 901.66s]  Frog tech. Don't you wish this guy had his own Nintendo video game? Well, he already did.
[902.78s -> 909.21s]  It's called Gex. Enter the gecko, right? Am I not doing it fast enough?
[910.89s -> 921.72s]  I want it in Smash. Monster cleaner. What's going on? How do I beat this level?
[923.16s -> 930.14s]  The fucking flowers. Because they're eating the flowers. I get it. That's a mechanic. Guys,
[930.14s -> 935.72s]  I've only played this game for like fucking four minutes. How? I don't know that. Oh,
[935.72s -> 941.85s]  hold on a minute. Quick zoom in. How could you not? I didn't. Hold on. How could you not like
[941.85s -> 953.48s]  it? It's got candy. See? Reference. That's the line that made me famous. That's where all of
[953.48s -> 961.96s]  my fame comes from. I said that one time. Now I tour college campuses. I've written
[961.96s -> 982.46s]  a couple of books. So what point do I give up on this one? You never finished that book. Yeah,
[982.46s -> 993.16s]  but I still read it. I don't get all these right now. I'm putting a hole in my monitor.
[996.06s -> 1008.90s]  What's going on? Okay, I did it. It's the same thing over and over.
[1009.62s -> 1014.12s]  What are these? Missiles? Why didn't missiles drop?
[1014.12s -> 1024.68s]  Okay, that strange reference. This is a reference stream. That's just the
[1025.48s -> 1028.92s]  papers please noise that the guy makes when you click on the thing.
[1035.45s -> 1038.97s]  T for teen. Actually, there's blood in this game. Not this one, but in this package.
[1039.85s -> 1047.75s]  All right, that's it. I've been on Super Frog for like 10 straight minutes.
[1047.75s -> 1052.31s]  We have a long way to go. We had to open it up strong. Very strong.
[1052.55s -> 1061.72s]  More keep going. No, I'm sorry. We're getting out of Super Frog in about 15 minutes.
[1064.25s -> 1076.65s]  I'll Frog tech these guys one more time. But if you want, okay, hold on. We talk a lot of shit
[1076.65s -> 1083.11s]  about this game and this product, but I really can't think of anything better. That's more
[1083.11s -> 1089.35s]  just completely benign than this game giving it to like a third grader. You know what I'm
[1089.35s -> 1095.48s]  saying? This is just the same level over and over again, where you just collect candies and you
[1095.48s -> 1108.52s]  shoot bubbles out of your mouth. This is so, there's no content here. None. So this is the
[1108.52s -> 1116.89s]  best thing for like a, okay, little Tim, you get 10 minutes on the computer to play Super Frog
[1116.89s -> 1120.01s]  and they're going to be like, oh, Super Frog. They don't give a shit. They don't even know
[1120.01s -> 1129.18s]  what they're doing. They can barely talk. That's worth its weight in gold as a parent.
[1133.80s -> 1138.76s]  You don't even have to, oh wait, if you're a good boy, then you get Captain Crunch. No,
[1138.76s -> 1141.72s]  no, no. If you're a good boy, you get 10 minutes of Super Frog and then you pretend
[1142.28s -> 1145.64s]  like it's the greatest thing in the world. Make sure you get him catching you playing it
[1146.52s -> 1151.40s]  like I am right now. Comes into the room. Dad, yeah, what's up? Hey son,
[1151.40s -> 1160.28s]  just playing some Super Frog and then they don't even understand. All right,
[1160.28s -> 1166.15s]  that's enough Super Frog. Oh yeah, there, there are two new emotes by the way.
[1166.15s -> 1169.51s]  There's Germa Old and then I turned Germa Expensive into Germa One, guys.
[1171.83s -> 1178.95s]  There will be a new Germa Expensive emote. Everyone, papers please, papers, papers, papers,
[1178.95s -> 1204.92s]  papers please. Ready? Holy shit. He's going to teach her this is F. What a terrible
[1204.92s -> 1210.07s]  character design, but that makes it so good. I thought my computer just crashed.
[1210.23s -> 1216.31s]  Let me, okay, let me change the desktop background to black. So this, like I see
[1216.31s -> 1219.59s]  Game of Thrones shit in the background. This is not a Game of Thrones background,
[1219.59s -> 1224.79s]  just in case you were curious. It's not. Let's just change it, personalize,
[1226.60s -> 1235.27s]  change it to just a solid color. Oh, look at that. Can you see? This is going to,
[1235.27s -> 1244.78s]  everyone, this is going to freak everybody out so much. Check this out. This is live right
[1244.78s -> 1250.92s]  now. This is happening. All right, we need to cross off. So here, let's go back to that list.
[1252.07s -> 1257.88s]  Oh god, we can't do that again. We can't sit there and play Super Frog for 10 minutes.
[1263.22s -> 1266.90s]  You know what I mean? This, we got to make this clear. So I need to add,
[1268.50s -> 1280.36s]  I need to add an X and just put it over that because we are not going back to it.
[1280.36s -> 1300.47s]  It's done. Super Frog, I almost put it on the wrong thing. Super Frog is done. All right,
[1300.47s -> 1307.59s]  shall we pick another one? Let's pick another one. If you'd like to click, we're going to,
[1307.59s -> 1310.23s]  just we're going to do this for the first little bit here. Click on where you'd like us
[1310.23s -> 1322.22s]  to go next. I'm not going to fucking Super Frog again. I am actually really surprised
[1322.22s -> 1334.68s]  at how well this is working. We're going to go from Super Frog to Super Fox.
[1342.60s -> 1348.52s]  What did I expect? Yeah, all right. Super Fox, thank you for participating. If you
[1348.52s -> 1359.99s]  want to participate, all you have to do is click the screen. Super Fox, it is. Good luck.
[1359.99s -> 1368.92s]  Oh, this is a full screen game. Uh oh, I have no control. This is in the other one too.
[1370.70s -> 1387.30s]  Is there any, can you guys even see this? Oh shit. Uh oh, hold on. Let's see if this works.
[1389.66s -> 1402.10s]  Can you guys see this? Because this, I can't change this. Is it still just,
[1402.10s -> 1419.26s]  just a black screen? Can you see this? What does it look like? It's small. I can't fix it.
[1419.26s -> 1426.17s]  This is how it has to be. I can't fix it because there's no, I can't put this into a window.
[1433.30s -> 1444.66s]  Zoom it out again. Oh Lord, hold on. Some of these games are just going to open.
[1445.70s -> 1449.86s]  Let's see if that helps. Yeah, it's, it's going to be like this. There's nothing I
[1449.86s -> 1458.71s]  can do about it. Can you see? Just like look real close into your screen because what's
[1458.71s -> 1471.74s]  happening is it's changing my resolution across every screen. This is great. Close it up.
[1471.74s -> 1476.78s]  So you can ride the alligator. You're going to get chased by, I thought he had a dick for a
[1476.78s -> 1481.26s]  second. I really did. It was like, holy shit, what the hell are they thinking? Here we go.
[1484.89s -> 1491.08s]  Choose if you want to play single or with a friend. We're going to play single. Pick two.
[1491.64s -> 1503.61s]  Choose the level pick you'd want to play. Pick two, pick one. Uh, pick seven. You must
[1503.61s -> 1507.21s]  reach the gate by jumping through the holes. You can run through the edges of the screen
[1507.85s -> 1513.34s]  by using to move, escape to in-game pause. All right. But again, I thought,
[1514.22s -> 1525.58s]  I hope you guys can see this. All right. So where, where am I? I just killed myself.
[1526.78s -> 1536.30s]  How? I'm smashing my skull on the bottom. So this one has presents and cheese and gummy
[1536.30s -> 1546.71s]  bears. Does that click? There's fall damage. Is that killing me? Okay. I'm running out of
[1546.71s -> 1555.19s]  lives. I just fucking smashed. How would, why would you make a super Mario game
[1555.99s -> 1568.26s]  where you can hurt your head? No, I ain't typing that in. It's going to go up to like some server
[1568.26s -> 1576.82s]  somewhere and they're going to know me. Okay. That's out. That's it. Thanks for playing.
[1577.38s -> 1590.15s]  That's it for super Fox. I'm not doing that one again. That's just, that's not going to
[1590.15s -> 1605.19s]  happen. Where's, where the fuck is it? So many on here. Okay. I'm not, no more super. Oh
[1605.19s -> 1613.29s]  damn it. Super. We've only done two. Oh God. I'm going to be here. This the first 24 hour stream.
[1615.00s -> 1622.14s]  Is it going to be this one? No, no, no, it's not. No way. All right. Let's do it again.
[1622.14s -> 1632.90s]  Where would you like to go? Oh, you fucking pranksters. Super frog to super Fox to super
[1632.90s -> 1645.54s]  Fox two. Okay. How much I might as well just go through and do all the supers.
[1647.19s -> 1657.64s]  I just, I'll just do them because they're just going to win every single thing.
[1657.64s -> 1672.31s]  All right. Let's play super Fox two. Thank you for participating. What the hell even is this?
[1672.31s -> 1679.24s]  Which collection is this in? I knew this was going to happen. Okay. I think it's color is
[1679.24s -> 1695.03s]  collection three. Yeah. Okay. Super Fox two. Tell me if you can see this. Oh God. It's doing
[1695.03s -> 1699.43s]  it again. It's loading up the it's fucking up the back. It's what, what's the difference?
[1706.92s -> 1723.14s]  They just made it. They gave him a different shirt. Look at how fucking small this is.
[1723.14s -> 1728.28s]  This is like one of, I got a lot of them have actually this one is different.
[1729.08s -> 1736.79s]  I wonder how closely you guys have to look right now. Chess or Trest hot air balloons
[1737.51s -> 1743.67s]  because I can't make it window and I can't get out. It's right now my monitor,
[1744.31s -> 1751.69s]  my actual, all of the monitors are in like 640 by 480. All right. Look closely because
[1752.49s -> 1758.01s]  I got a fucked up screen too. I thought the deck tiger was really, really happy that he
[1758.01s -> 1760.81s]  killed like a bunch of people. I thought these were all like dead bodies lying around. I don't
[1760.81s -> 1769.06s]  know why I went to that immediately, right? That's what I thought it was. I thought he was like
[1769.06s -> 1783.43s]  looking happy. Check the Nvidia control panel settings. Uh, well what's happening is it's,
[1784.15s -> 1786.23s]  right? That's the same problem happened last time I played this.
[1787.88s -> 1793.08s]  Whereas some of them just force. It doesn't matter what you do. The game physically cannot
[1793.08s -> 1798.18s]  turn on unless the monitor is at 640 by 480. Remember these games are, these games
[1798.18s -> 1807.38s]  were made in like fucking two hours each. What happened? And there's your case in point.
[1809.59s -> 1824.46s]  This game took 42 minutes to make. And after that we're out. Okay. Well that was fun. And
[1824.46s -> 1832.14s]  I'm just, I'm just gonna get it out of the way because, oh Jesus, it's still on. We're
[1832.14s -> 1845.66s]  gonna, I'm gonna open up Super Mole right now. Yes, I know, I know, I know, I know. I know
[1845.66s -> 1854.70s]  that the mole is the next one that you want to see. I'm certain of it. How is this one?
[1855.43s -> 1859.51s]  Oh God. All the ones that are Super Mole and Super Fox, they all do the same thing.
[1871.77s -> 1892.14s]  Damn it. You don't have no options to. It's not bad? It's not that bad? What the fuck is this?
[1892.86s -> 1908.17s]  What am I supposed to do? What? Mole movement. Use current weapon. Switch weapons.
[1909.21s -> 1912.76s]  This is not like the other Super games. I don't like this. It's different. I don't like this.
[1913.64s -> 1918.06s]  The developers decided to go into like a gem hunting spelunky way. I don't like it. I
[1918.06s -> 1925.93s]  want the old Super games. All right. It's weapon hotkeys. Get rid of panels. Suicide.
[1942.76s -> 1946.12s]  Didn't even give himself a chance. Where are you getting those grenades?
[1947.64s -> 1958.86s]  This game already exists. What's it called? Uh, Dig Dug. Oh, there's a grenade. Smell the,
[1958.86s -> 1966.49s]  smell it. Wait, wait, wait. They're gonna crush me. Okay. Watch out. Don't get crushed.
[1967.29s -> 1985.86s]  Uh-oh. I just check mated myself. Did I? Fucking 900 million IQ. I like this one.
[1986.42s -> 1995.38s]  I just, what? I just got like a nuke. What the fuck? Oh shit. I have, oh yeah. I have like
[1995.38s -> 2002.87s]  bombs. TNT. What is this one? Is it a mine? Poison. Drink poison. I just drank poison.
[2003.93s -> 2030.18s]  Holy shit. I can go. Okay. It's like a Pac-Man power cube. I like this one. This one's actually
[2030.18s -> 2040.58s]  kind of fun. Cool. Enemies. There's no enemies left to destroy. It's not exciting, but this
[2040.58s -> 2047.22s]  is a good game. Yeah. You don't die from that. Good. Oh, I have a health meter. Sick.
[2049.06s -> 2070.71s]  There's actual thought in this one. That was fun. All right. This is where it derails.
[2070.71s -> 2075.27s]  How long has it been? Because that's the first one that I think is still open in the
[2075.27s -> 2087.26s]  task manager. And if I close it, it might kill the whole computer. Why?
[2087.26s -> 2092.60s]  Why? No, I think we're fine. No, we're good. No, we're good. We're good. We're good. We're
[2092.60s -> 2098.74s]  good. Everything's fine, right? I can still change scenes. Oh, we're golden. Let's go ahead and
[2101.26s -> 2113.58s]  get that over Super Mole. And then we had Super Fox 2, right? Super Fox 2 was down here
[2115.05s -> 2125.42s]  and we've played four games. Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. All right. So
[2126.06s -> 2144.25s]  where would you like to go next? Oh, wonderful, lovely audience of mine. We're in this together.
[2144.25s -> 2151.67s]  Oh, yes, we are. I'm seeing a lot of, uh, it's more so now that there's no more
[2152.73s -> 2159.51s]  Super in the title seem to be pretty evenly split except for fish food, which is the
[2159.51s -> 2166.15s]  next one we're going to play. So let's go ahead and open up fish food. Hopefully this one
[2166.15s -> 2177.32s]  has even a full screen graphic option. That would be very nice. Now I get to do the fun
[2177.32s -> 2183.11s]  task of finding where the fuck that game is. Okay. Found it. Fish food. Let's go.
[2185.02s -> 2188.86s]  If you think this is going to be even remotely close to insane aquarium, you are,
[2188.86s -> 2202.17s]  you are so wrong that it's actually making me angry. Let's do it. Yes. Yes. Thank God.
[2202.17s -> 2210.06s]  What? Why would you have a maximized window if it doesn't do anything?
[2211.50s -> 2219.69s]  Oh my fucking God. It just increases the window.
[2223.00s -> 2227.32s]  When did this come out? I'm, so hold on a minute. Let's be fucking serious for one second.
[2228.73s -> 2235.03s]  When did this come out? Two. Okay. This is designed for windows seven and windows eight.
[2235.11s -> 2240.55s]  Okay. Why would you have a six 40 by four 80 window in like 2013?
[2242.15s -> 2250.87s]  Did you just hit the pinnacle of where you are able to design a video game and you just
[2250.87s -> 2256.04s]  don't even attempt to go any further. This game came out probably in like,
[2257.02s -> 2261.10s]  did this come up this year? What's the copyright on it? 2014.
[2263.67s -> 2267.91s]  And you're still making fucking six 40 by four 80 windows. You can't like fix this.
[2269.03s -> 2280.54s]  Well, I, I'll try. What the hell is muse on? What's this fucked up weird, like
[2281.10s -> 2298.44s]  out of the scene in Adobe flash Easter egg affiliate link. All right. Fuck it. Let's go.
[2299.56s -> 2306.25s]  How to play meet Sonny is small. See that you guys have it, have it easy. I got it hard
[2306.25s -> 2310.65s]  because I have to look at the fucking screen that is under a microscope.
[2312.06s -> 2316.06s]  Fast ocean. Use your mouse to help Sonny survive in these dangerous waters. Follow
[2316.06s -> 2319.58s]  these rules. Eat the fish smaller than yourself. Avoid the fish bigger than yourself.
[2319.58s -> 2329.98s]  Eat enough fish to grow up. That's an overworld. Meet Sonny. Look at this.
[2330.78s -> 2335.00s]  All right. Fish frenzy has more levels than Donkey Kong country.
[2335.64s -> 2341.90s]  Something's wrong there. Did I already eat something? And you get the mouse on the screen
[2341.90s -> 2362.20s]  too. You got me so far. I can eat these guys. I'm going to get gnomed. No,
[2363.08s -> 2366.44s]  I'm not going to get gnomed. This was so easy. This is level one though.
[2366.44s -> 2378.30s]  What I get gnomed in this. The gnome didn't even exist until like 16 months ago. I don't
[2378.30s -> 2385.93s]  know why I'm referring to the gnome in baby years. Like how old a baby is golden fish.
[2389.78s -> 2395.06s]  Wow. I just got gnomed. It just happened. You just saw it on the screen. I just got fucking
[2395.06s -> 2408.41s]  gnomed. All right. Let's speed run this. I wonder how far I can get before fucking raging.
[2408.41s -> 2414.10s]  Oh, he's going to rage. Hey, place your bets guys. What's it going to rage?
[2414.10s -> 2429.70s]  This is not what I thought the game was going to be like. I kind of need to see.
[2434.36s -> 2438.30s]  Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What's with all this stuff?
[2440.60s -> 2449.94s]  Uh, toxic waste dump. What's with the, what's with the bomb over here? Am I going to get to choose
[2449.94s -> 2462.34s]  two different paths? Going through toxic waste, die by a whale or like nuclear explosion.
[2466.39s -> 2472.49s]  This is important. Oh wow. We got big guys. We got big guys. He can, he can grow too.
[2473.45s -> 2476.17s]  God, this just reminds me of BBB so much. You know what I mean?
[2476.49s -> 2485.96s]  I'm getting some real, like it's itchy. I'm getting those real BBB vibes. Uh-oh.
[2485.96s -> 2503.24s]  Gnome me. Don't gnome me. We're going with first death. Game over. Hope you guys are aware of
[2503.24s -> 2515.64s]  that. Can I beat this whole game in one setting in about nine months? This is going to be so
[2515.64s -> 2523.99s]  long. I want to see what happens when we get to the nuke, but the difficulty is going
[2523.99s -> 2526.63s]  to ramp up. They don't want anyone completing the game because guess what?
[2527.19s -> 2530.79s]  There is no completing the game. After level 16, there's nothing there. It's that's just
[2530.79s -> 2538.60s]  there. It'll be a liar. I didn't count. I'm 11. They didn't develop past like level 12.
[2539.69s -> 2550.71s]  That map is not going to work after 12 levels. I guarantee it. Guaranteed. You see that needle
[2550.71s -> 2566.46s]  threat right there? Nobody, none of you, nobody in this chat could do that. I'm surprised
[2566.46s -> 2573.62s]  nobody's made the joke in this chat yet. It's pretty easy. First game that Jeremy's been
[2573.62s -> 2597.10s]  able to get S ranking on. Where is that? I haven't seen that yet. Go. You just got,
[2597.10s -> 2614.62s]  okay, I'm gonna, I'm gonna speed this process up. Come on, I can do this quick.
[2619.88s -> 2640.63s]  He ate them all. That's not fair. Get out of here. Ah, GDQ run. Doesn't matter. Yeah,
[2640.63s -> 2646.31s]  it does. I'm about to escape. This game, this actually, I don't know why that hurt my back,
[2646.31s -> 2661.80s]  but it did. Just don't touch a whale and I'm good. Oh, what a perfect use of that
[2661.80s -> 2672.31s]  emo. Yeah, after God. I'm losing growth is what's happening. All right, that's enough. I'm done.
[2673.27s -> 2682.10s]  We're gonna be sitting here for so long. Get to the toxic waste or riot. One, two, three,
[2682.10s -> 2692.94s]  four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. That's 11 more levels. Yeah, that is actually kind of
[2692.94s -> 2699.42s]  funny. There's two endings to the game. One where I become a gigantic fish and I win and
[2699.42s -> 2710.95s]  the other one where a nuke goes off. Very interesting stuff. I'm not gonna win. I'm
[2710.95s -> 2729.77s]  gonna lose here. That just, that was the button to click to add like two minutes to this game.
[2733.94s -> 2741.34s]  Thank God, because that music was gonna be the reason to hit escape.
[2752.73s -> 2759.18s]  No, that's it. I'm done. I can't leave again. How do I leave? I think I have to just click
[2759.18s -> 2770.22s]  the X. No escape. This, I probably have to beat the level to go to the menu.
[2771.30s -> 2775.62s]  It's not even gonna be toxic waste. It's just a thing on the map that somebody drew and put
[2775.62s -> 2783.93s]  there. Haven't you ever played a game? Haven't you guys ever played a game before? Haven't
[2783.93s -> 2798.01s]  you guys ever played a game with as an overworld? Yeah, it's a phone game. In Candy Crush,
[2798.01s -> 2802.33s]  you do the same thing over and over and over again and then you walk by the clown with
[2802.33s -> 2806.49s]  the funny pink hair and he doesn't, like, there's no clown. There's mines here though.
[2807.13s -> 2819.75s]  Well, this was fun. This was a fun one. What am I talking about? Look, these are mines.
[2820.47s -> 2839.96s]  You're already halfway to the waste. They're the same four enemies. We're not going to
[2839.96s -> 2851.61s]  even get to see a new enemy type. It's the same spongebob fish. It's over. Say, I was
[2851.61s -> 2861.51s]  trying to circle that guy and I forgot. It was that one. That was a super fish. What the
[2861.51s -> 2871.37s]  fuck was that one even called? I don't know. That one was called fish food and it is now over.
[2871.93s -> 2887.53s]  Where are we going? See, now it's split. I'm gonna have to sit here for a minute or two
[2888.90s -> 2899.02s]  because this shit is locked down. All you fucking guys clicking on feeding frenzy
[2899.58s -> 2906.06s]  that want to see the same game again, but this time the fish is green instead of yellow.
[2906.54s -> 2918.95s]  Spy chaser. This one's probably... I think I remember this one. This one's 3D. We're going
[2918.95s -> 2929.10s]  spy chaser. Yeah, this is a 3D game which means it's probably gonna fucking crash the computer.
[2929.10s -> 2934.34s]  This might be the first landmine of the evening, so I'll be right back if it crashes.
[2935.50s -> 2947.08s]  Thanks for voting. And where is it? Spy chasers. It's pack two, I believe. Spy chasers. Okay.
[2947.08s -> 2958.49s]  Is that not it? No, it is. What the fuck is it? Spy chasers. There it is. All right,
[2958.49s -> 2971.21s]  here we go. Good luck. See you. See you maybe in like a minute when my computer blue screens.
[2971.21s -> 3019.58s]  Huh? Are we good? Is it open? That was spy chaser. Pretty good. Pretty fun. Where are we going
[3019.58s -> 3037.13s]  next? I thought they fixed all these. All right. Somebody keep... Somebody jot it down.
[3037.13s -> 3042.39s]  Somebody keep a mental note somewhere of the ones that didn't work. I guess I could just do
[3042.39s -> 3050.46s]  that. I have a monitor right here. So, because I want to see if I can go into like
[3050.46s -> 3055.50s]  the fucking game like I and I files or something and try to like force that to open.
[3055.50s -> 3062.44s]  Okay, spy chaser was one of them. Just write it on the monitor.
[3065.58s -> 3072.82s]  I could just do that, right? Just half like... But no, I like... I can't...
[3076.79s -> 3081.66s]  No, there's no reason for that. I can just write it here. All right,
[3081.66s -> 3091.64s]  looks like we're going feeding frenzy. Let me click on monster doors. Is it too far over?
[3093.64s -> 3103.35s]  Hahaha. Let me click monster doors. What are you doing? What the fuck? Fuck. File Arter.
[3103.35s -> 3107.03s]  It's cool. I told you Dutch made that cool again to like be able to like
[3107.03s -> 3120.76s]  voice crack. It used to be not cool. All right, we're going to feeding frenzy.
[3120.76s -> 3134.87s]  You can't wait. Looking forward to it. Yes, I'm sure. I'm sure I want you to open this.
[3135.43s -> 3143.78s]  It's like, are you sure you want to open that file? I guess. Here we go. Well, this
[3143.78s -> 3163.05s]  one opens. That's a Harley Quinn without any makeup on. Options. Wait, what? This is the one
[3163.69s -> 3174.65s]  this is the fast one, but it's so small in the corner. Wait, wait, wait. I might be able to fix
[3174.65s -> 3185.54s]  this a little bit. Let me see if I can fix this. If I go like this and then move it down like
[3185.54s -> 3189.99s]  that, you guys are going to tell me if this helps at all because there's no way I'm going
[3190.07s -> 3208.65s]  to be able to know. It kind of did. It kind of did, right? All right. So game speed. Yeah,
[3208.65s -> 3213.37s]  it's as fast as possible. And here's the thing that I did this on a different computer that
[3213.37s -> 3231.14s]  time. Is this supposed to be ash? All right, here we go. Go fishing. Oh God, it's going to
[3231.14s -> 3240.01s]  do it. I know it, but I'm at like probably 3000 frames a second. Oh my God. It just
[3240.01s -> 3262.46s]  crashed. What the fuck is happening? No, why? Oh my God. What the hell was that for?
[3264.79s -> 3292.34s]  There's no reason for that. No, it's doing it. I get Jesus. This collection came out in 2014.
[3292.34s -> 3331.03s]  That was not like three decades ago. Oh my God. Why? My head hurts. This is supposed
[3331.03s -> 3345.43s]  to be version two. How is that version two? Somebody just dragged and dropped a folder into
[3345.43s -> 3356.63s]  a new folder and named it two and then sneezed in the thumb drive. My God. Okay.
[3357.43s -> 3364.20s]  Um, I'm going to write that one down too. So, uh, feeding frenzy also didn't fucking
[3364.20s -> 3368.92s]  do anything. Well, it did do something. It, it turned on a Halloween strobe light
[3368.92s -> 3374.63s]  into almost 6,000 people's faces. Can you imagine how fucked up that is?
[3375.75s -> 3382.41s]  What I've just done on the stream. I did, there is a stadium here full of people
[3383.61s -> 3401.50s]  that I just flashed and then I walked off the stage. All right. I think, I think people
[3401.50s -> 3405.90s]  are trying to click down on monster doors, but maybe they can't.
[3411.70s -> 3414.58s]  Is everybody like, all right, I'm actually concerned about that.
[3415.30s -> 3417.70s]  How would I ever know that opening feeding frenzy was going on?
[3423.32s -> 3429.66s]  What the fuck is this big frenzy from now on here on out, I'm just going to flash myself.
[3429.66s -> 3437.93s]  Okay. So I'm not going to change over to the game until I'm certain that like it looks all
[3437.93s -> 3445.19s]  right. Well, wait a minute. Hold on. Now we've got, okay. Big frenzy. So big frenzy's looks
[3445.19s -> 3455.91s]  like it's going to be the one that wins 50%. Thank you for voting. Okay. Big frenzy. This
[3455.91s -> 3463.94s]  one is in best video game hits four. Big frenzy. I'm not changing this over yet. Well,
[3463.94s -> 3470.79s]  I am actually for a second because I need to. So hold on. I feel like we, I like the
[3470.79s -> 3474.07s]  camera being on like, I feel like takes us into another dimension. Like we're already in
[3474.07s -> 3477.59s]  like a fucked up dimension and bringing it back to reality for a second. So just hold on.
[3481.48s -> 3485.56s]  I'm still in pain from that flash. That's the fucking worst thing I've ever seen.
[3487.58s -> 3492.25s]  All right. Let's make sure this is actually going to be captured.
[3498.28s -> 3509.16s]  Okay. Big frenzy. Please, please just spare us. Spare me because I'm the one that's
[3509.16s -> 3517.22s]  looking at it right now. All right. Okay. This has, this has video options.
[3518.02s -> 3557.35s]  It's, I can't make the screen bigger. Brightness medium. That should make it a little better.
[3558.46s -> 3569.00s]  Come on back to me. Bug, bug man. What about bug frenzy? It's a little better. Holy shit.
[3569.00s -> 3575.13s]  This is fucked up. This is not right. This is not right. Oh, I don't know why this
[3575.13s -> 3581.24s]  happened. I just, it just reached into the fucking computer screen through and like
[3581.24s -> 3589.06s]  choked me. It fucking crashed. I just actually got strangled by that game.
[3589.06s -> 3606.33s]  Okay. It looks a little better. Could be better though. That's as good as it's going to get.
[3608.71s -> 3618.20s]  Start. It was nighttime. The firefly flew around the garden collecting glowing eggs.
[3622.36s -> 3628.68s]  Why is this written in shitty chalk? Okay. Is that what, is that what the bug did?
[3638.62s -> 3644.30s]  Am I dead? Oh, that was actually kind of brutal.
[3646.47s -> 3670.92s]  Okay. We'll try it again. I'm going to try to get every single crunch berry.
[3674.18s -> 3676.95s]  That's a song. What popular song is that?
[3684.70s -> 3689.02s]  What is it? Oh my God. It's going to, it's, it just strangled me.
[3697.18s -> 3709.51s]  It's tonight's going to be a good night. No, no, this is not the top
[3709.51s -> 3719.78s]  one most embarrassing spring. I'm so quirky, right?
[3728.79s -> 3739.83s]  I did it. So we do it again. I'm not stopping until somebody puts in the chat what this song
[3739.83s -> 3762.09s]  is and what interlude this is. No, it's not again and again. It's for you and then you
[3762.09s -> 3767.61s]  and for you and for you and for you and for, is this wrong? What am I doing? Is that wrong?
[3768.81s -> 3786.98s]  I got a feeling that tonight's going to be a good night. No, it's not.
[3792.63s -> 3829.75s]  What's this thing do? Oh, I have another life. I was going to,
[3836.52s -> 3842.52s]  how many more is this? Last one? Only like one more little quadrant up here
[3843.32s -> 3845.00s]  and then we can finally get this shit going.
[3851.67s -> 3853.11s]  All right, get me the fuck out of this.
[3853.11s -> 3866.68s]  That was, I don't even know what that was. I forget what that was already. That was
[3867.40s -> 3879.59s]  Bug Frenzy? Where the hell is it? There it is. It's been an hour. That was Bug Fuck?
[3880.62s -> 3886.90s]  I don't think the title of that game was Bug Fuck. I'm pretty sure it was Bug Frenzy.
[3888.87s -> 3893.43s]  All right. Where are we going now? I know you can't click on the bottom of the screen,
[3893.43s -> 3897.61s]  but I'm sorry. There's not much I can do about it. These are like five separate
[3897.61s -> 3911.80s]  images that I had to staple together. Never has no one ever. It's never have no one ever by the
[3911.80s -> 3925.32s]  Smiths. All right. I don't know if this is Gerbil Quest or Monster Doors, so I'm going
[3925.32s -> 3945.93s]  to say it's Gerbil Quest. Let's open up Gerbil Quest. Again, all these fucking things.
[3945.93s -> 3951.06s]  I just wish, here's the worst part. Going through this the first time,
[3952.74s -> 3956.90s]  like I could like set up the capture again. I could change the window. I'm going to burp
[3956.90s -> 3964.01s]  real loud. No, I'm not. Okay. Here we go. No, I'm going to turn it off because I don't want you
[3964.01s -> 3975.18s]  to see this because what if it's a fucking flash? Oh, did Gerbil Quest not open?
[3983.30s -> 4007.00s]  Trying to. Write it down. Gerbil Quest does not open. So that's why Chaser Feeding Frenzy
[4007.00s -> 4014.55s]  Gerbil Quest. See if we can get this to open later for the encore part of the stream.
[4016.41s -> 4019.85s]  Uh, looks like everyone wants Monster Doors because you can't go any lower.
[4021.53s -> 4028.57s]  Monster Doors or we riot. You're going to get your Monster Door or it might be a land mine.
[4029.91s -> 4048.92s]  Monster Door. Incoming. Let's try it. Monster Door. We're good. No, we're not. It's a land
[4048.92s -> 4061.86s]  mine. Fuck. It's a land mine. It's up. No, it's not. Thank goodness. I'm scared to do that.
[4065.37s -> 4076.54s]  No, we ain't doing that. No way. Do you think I'm going to full screen that game?
[4077.50s -> 4082.95s]  Dad, talk about a door I don't want to open. That one. All right. It's off center. Someone's
[4082.95s -> 4086.55s]  going to be like, it's off center-ree. It's off center-ree. Right? Someone's going to do
[4086.55s -> 4090.42s]  that. I know someone's going to write that. Okay. We're good.
[4096.49s -> 4106.95s]  That's an exponential increase. All right. You ready? Monster Doors. Classic original puzzle
[4106.95s -> 4112.39s]  with one figure to collect. Two by two. Every fourth level you'll get a new figure to collect.
[4112.47s -> 4120.01s]  I don't know what that means. Level one. Points to pass a level 160.
[4122.76s -> 4132.54s]  Collect figures. Monsters. This jester's bonus figure. I don't understand what's going on.
[4141.85s -> 4156.94s]  So they come out of the barn floppy disk doors. What's the goal? This is Hotel Mario.
[4158.94s -> 4169.32s]  But what the number muncher is monsters. I don't have a score yet. Score yet. So they have
[4169.32s -> 4177.46s]  to... that's not a score? Wait. Hold on. I think I get it. That's a four in a row, right?
[4177.46s -> 4200.81s]  Jackpot. I need a green down here. Got it. Five in a row. Jackpot. Nope. I need a green right
[4200.81s -> 4218.66s]  here. Got it. Watch this shit. Bingo. Oh no. That's not going to happen. Uh. How am I
[4218.66s -> 4226.01s]  supposed to set this up? I need one. There's too many greens. Too many green figures.
[4226.57s -> 4239.16s]  Just make a square. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. I get it. Okay. But I'm looking at the bonus game.
[4246.18s -> 4251.70s]  Oh I get it now. Watch this. I'll fucking run through this shit.
[4268.90s -> 4282.76s]  This is fun. I like this one. That's what I was trying to do right there. I get a double.
[4287.11s -> 4293.59s]  I did it. I beat the level. I win. All right. Now that I know what's going on. Watch this.
[4334.55s -> 4359.30s]  Yeah. Oh wait. Look out. Oh shit. It's uh. It's the birdie from Five Nights at Freddy's.
[4359.30s -> 4398.17s]  Why is nobody clicking on the screen? That's you.
[4412.60s -> 4421.86s]  VeggieTales? Where's the VeggieTales one? You want me to play 100,000 Mahjong games.
[4421.86s -> 4443.77s]  Okay. That looks like the place we're going. I click. Wait. Am I saying it wrong?
[4443.77s -> 4450.68s]  It's. It's Mahjong, right? Mahjong? Mahjong. It's correct, isn't it? Am I doing it wrong?
[4457.90s -> 4469.66s]  All right. Let's open it. 100,000 Mahjong games. Let's see what happens here. Let's get it open.
[4469.66s -> 4481.02s]  All right. Look at this. Oh wow. So interesting to note about this one in particular. This is
[4481.02s -> 4499.93s]  very important. This is the Windows 95 logo. It might even be Windows 3.1. They just don't
[4499.93s -> 4505.42s]  give a shit, do they? I have no idea how to play this. I don't know what any of this
[4505.42s -> 4510.06s]  means. I've never done it before. I think maybe I think one time I watched my brother play it
[4510.86s -> 4523.83s]  and you have to match symbols or something, right? Match tiles because and they're layered.
[4523.83s -> 4545.24s]  So I gotta find this. I gotta find these two. I'm gonna wait for it
[4545.24s -> 4551.16s]  until somebody figures out what I'm doing. Just gonna hang out here for a second.
[4567.13s -> 4570.33s]  Oh yeah. I was right. You have to match them. Okay. So get out of here. Get off
[4570.33s -> 4575.29s]  the screen. Get out of here. I don't need that. I'll figure it out. It's just here we go.
[4595.62s -> 4616.82s]  What on earth are you guys clicking right now? All right. Hold on. I can do it.
[4616.82s -> 4686.74s]  No one's on here. I'm just being silent right now. I'm being so quiet. It has to be on the edge.
[4686.74s -> 4699.10s]  Got it. Sometimes you just figure out that you're really good at something.
[4699.10s -> 4712.68s]  What? That's on the edge. It's a nice interesting game. So where are the 100...
[4713.32s -> 4728.26s]  Okay. Are there 100,000 pieces? 3D? Wait. What? This is so much easier to see this.
[4730.94s -> 4747.50s]  This is 3D. This is 2D apparently. What did I just do? Let me like use my finger.
[4747.50s -> 4757.64s]  Hold on. I gotta use my finger. Like I sometimes I need to use my hands
[4757.64s -> 4762.31s]  because I got a top screen here. So I'm gonna make sure you guys can see what I'm doing.
[4762.95s -> 4787.82s]  I used to be pretty good at this. One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, five, six.
[4788.54s -> 4797.66s]  These two. Those two. These two. Right there. Those two. Those two. These two. Six,
[4797.74s -> 4803.77s]  seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen. Okay. I'm kind of stuck here though
[4803.77s -> 4815.61s]  because there's a couple of different ways to sit in eight, nine. Okay. Now I can do really
[4815.61s -> 4826.57s]  quick math in my head. So green into green and then the red into red and then the black
[4827.29s -> 4849.16s]  frame into the green and then... Okay. Okay. That was kind of hard. It was like
[4849.88s -> 4861.78s]  touching the screen is like hard to do. But I got it. That was fun. What a god of a game. I mean,
[4864.09s -> 4868.79s]  stop. Let's say that. Not really. Kind of. I mean, you know, sometimes. I mean, you know,
[4868.79s -> 4884.52s]  whatever. Thanks for the compliment. That was a hundred thousand mahjong games. Computer loadup
[4884.52s -> 4900.47s]  celery man. What? You lost 300 viewers playing mahjong. Well, let's be honest here.
[4901.19s -> 4907.86s]  If you clicked on a live stream and a guy was playing mahjong on it and it was on the screen
[4907.86s -> 4913.78s]  for more than 10 seconds, you'd probably be like, ah, I don't know if I want to watch a
[4913.78s -> 4920.78s]  guy play mahjong and you'd probably just leave. All right. Where are we going now? What do you
[4920.78s -> 4933.64s]  guys think? Oh, are we, are we considering another 3D game that's guaranteed to either
[4933.64s -> 4953.35s]  not work or crash OBS? I'm looking forward to it. Why does nobody like Adam Ball?
[4953.59s -> 4963.78s]  Adam Ball. There's the Pac-Man clone. That one's from the last one, too. One vote is currently
[4963.78s -> 4974.18s]  on. One vote is currently on. All right, let's open it. This is, uh, what the heck is this one?
[4974.82s -> 4979.45s]  Which one are you clicking on? Mystery World War II aerial dogfight. I remember this one
[4979.45s -> 4983.61s]  was in the other one, too. It has really loud music and impossible to control. Welcome
[4983.61s -> 5000.38s]  to the reference. Here comes a reference. Thank you for voting. Let's just redo the video.
[5000.94s -> 5006.60s]  All right. I'm going to make sure the screen is not, uh, going to be terrible here.
[5006.60s -> 5018.41s]  What the hell is OBS? Where did OBS go? Oh my, that was kind of scary. All right. Let's,
[5018.41s -> 5022.25s]  I'm not going to change it yet just in case it's all fucked up. And we have video
[5022.25s -> 5036.71s]  options. So resolution, field of view, big. This mic. Okay. You take a look at this and
[5036.71s -> 5038.79s]  you tell me if you think this is going to crash the whole fucking game in the whole
[5039.67s -> 5052.92s]  stream. Not me, not my face. This. I mean, resolution, scene detail, shadow reflection,
[5052.92s -> 5059.24s]  cool effect if enabled, if special effects is enabled, 3D sound, hardware sound. This is
[5059.24s -> 5067.46s]  just all these boxes are ways to crash my computer. Think of the amount of troubleshooting
[5067.46s -> 5083.45s]  it would take to potentially have to deal with all these checkboxes. Good luck. I just
[5083.45s -> 5097.29s]  clicked it. Oh, it worked. Yeah. This is the same one. I remember this one,
[5098.01s -> 5112.58s]  the loud ass music. All right, hold on. I can make it look better. That's as good as
[5112.58s -> 5120.92s]  it's going to get. Oh no. No, wait, didn't this happen before? This happened last time.
[5120.92s -> 5125.32s]  It cracked. This happened in the video. It crashed the computer. I remember. And
[5125.32s -> 5128.92s]  I finally got it to work. It's over. It's done. This happened in the last fucking,
[5128.92s -> 5142.25s]  in the video. No. Oh my God. I can't fucking believe it. That just relived it. Oh, you gotta
[5142.25s -> 5153.69s]  be kidding me. God damn it. Go pull up that video. Watch this part. This exact same thing
[5153.69s -> 5171.22s]  happened. I had to restart the computer. I think. Fuck. Hold on. Oh shit. I think I
[5171.22s -> 5180.65s]  can get it. Can I just kill it from here? It might kill OBS. No. Oh no. No. Don't
[5180.65s -> 5210.34s]  kill OBS. Good luck. I'll see you guys soon. Hopefully. If it doesn't. Hello? Where's the
[5210.34s -> 5242.15s]  webcam? Am I still here? Uh, what? I didn't do that. I didn't do that. What happened
[5242.15s -> 5266.33s]  to the camera? Can you see this? Okay. So this time we're going to hold on. Oh,
[5266.33s -> 5282.87s]  that was wild. I can't. This, here we go. Ready? Hands up. I clicked it. I'm not touching
[5282.87s -> 5292.97s]  anything. Oh, you can feel it. Feel it. Do you see that? Do you feel it? I'm like fucking
[5292.97s -> 5308.95s]  melting. I can't do anything about this. Just fucking campaign. Who cares? Yep. This
[5308.95s -> 5332.74s]  is the, I remember you can't control the plane. What happened? Oh, end. All right. Let's go.
[5334.70s -> 5338.46s]  Leave your left hand on the keyboard. Okay. Is it, is it, is it going to sense it?
[5339.42s -> 5356.94s]  You could hit the broad side of a bond. Why am I doing this? Repeat fucking emo face. That
[5356.94s -> 5379.38s]  guy's making. Got it. No, no. Exit. Exit the game. Oh shit. Quickly. Hold on. No,
[5379.38s -> 5406.14s]  this might be it. Oh, fuck. It's over. I can't. I'm the task manager is on the
[5406.22s -> 5415.94s]  other monitor. Oh shit. I did it accidentally. Oh my fucking God.
[5435.42s -> 5459.72s]  That was a 3d game that I should never open ever again. What are you clicking on now?
[5463.80s -> 5474.82s]  I'm so upset that this is just the same fucking game. There's almost no differences. It's
[5474.82s -> 5482.10s]  probably all DigiPen student games for a shell company. Honest to God though, why is this a
[5482.10s -> 5489.72s]  second version? I'm going to, okay, at some point here, I want to open up the screenshot that I took
[5490.52s -> 5497.08s]  of the last one and actually see if they just put two in front of the game and release it again.
[5497.64s -> 5518.09s]  Looks like we're going to, uh, atom ball, atom ball. What a joke. What an absolute joke.
[5520.42s -> 5528.14s]  700,000 games to nothing is the same games have the same problems. We just put a two in
[5528.14s -> 5537.69s]  front. That's it. I'd like to know what the two what it actually is. So we're going atom atom ball.
[5538.25s -> 5545.42s]  All right. Hold on to your, uh, hold on to your hats because here comes atom ball.
[5548.60s -> 5552.92s]  Where the hell is it? I actually don't even know where it is. Atom ball. Oh, okay. It's
[5552.92s -> 5565.45s]  down this one. This one. All right. Here we go. Good luck. I'm going to have to do a full
[5565.45s -> 5579.11s]  clean install of windows after this. Let me just make sure it works. Same problems as last
[5579.11s -> 5588.95s]  time. I'm just reliving the making of that last video. Does that one didn't open? What is the two
[5588.95s -> 5602.34s]  for? What is the two for? You've misread. It's 700,000 games to meaning also means it's just
[5602.34s -> 5607.14s]  again. Oh my God. This one doesn't open either. Adam. What's it called?
[5607.78s -> 5615.29s]  Adam ball. Put an X on it. We also need to see if the same games didn't open
[5615.29s -> 5622.28s]  because I thought some of them did. Holy shit. I can't even fucking believe this.
[5626.31s -> 5637.82s]  Well, let's see what else there is to try and attempt. What's the original 700,000 games like?
[5638.46s -> 5648.76s]  It's this. It's this. It's the same thing. I think I think we may have actually been baited
[5649.48s -> 5663.06s]  on me making the video again. That's what happened. So it looks like we're doing, uh,
[5663.94s -> 5673.02s]  the ancient Mayan empire. All those are the same exact game. All right. Just in case anyone's
[5673.02s -> 5683.42s]  wondering, there's no difference in those games. There's no differences. They are all the same
[5683.42s -> 5689.86s]  game. So we, I can just delete all of these. Oh my God. This is going to take 20,000 hours.
[5690.42s -> 5703.21s]  Secret empires of Maya open it. Holy shit. This actually takes up the whole screen.
[5704.86s -> 5716.42s]  What a miracle. That's an actual miracle. Is this the first? This is the first one that's actually
[5716.42s -> 5730.52s]  1920 by 1080. Why is this all off? Okay. Hey, remember that video? Ow, my ears.
[5731.80s -> 5756.66s]  Hey, what's this one? Let's try this one. Now I know why they had it all turned down.
[5758.42s -> 5766.90s]  Uh, secret empire of the ancient world. Inca. Good. All right. What are we looking for?
[5766.90s -> 5774.50s]  Looking for chain crowbar, sunglasses, domino tires, seagull, seagull, Russian doll, maps,
[5774.50s -> 5795.40s]  sapphire, sapphires. Got it. Oh my God. Why? It just reset. It's the same. There's no difference.
[5795.40s -> 5800.60s]  It's the same background. It's just a desktop background with a bunch of random blurry bitmap
[5800.60s -> 5804.20s]  images. This is the same thing as it was before. There's not one single difference.
[5804.20s -> 5818.55s]  We're looking for brooch, wheel, belt, oil can, skull, scrub brush, owl, lunchbox.
[5819.51s -> 5839.43s]  That's not, that's not correct. Good work. You found one. Lunchbox. What is this? A piece
[5839.43s -> 5852.70s]  of bread? All right. I got that one. I only need the owl and that's it. Where's the owl?
[5852.70s -> 5861.75s]  Find it. Found it. I did it. Done. Oh no, I didn't. Brooch, wheel, and belt. Wheel,
[5862.63s -> 5867.46s]  with sunglasses. Why are you clicking on the sun? There's the brooch.
[5868.10s -> 5873.46s]  And then we need a belt. There's the belt. Congratulations. You have won the game. Thank
[5873.46s -> 5895.77s]  you for playing. What the fuck? Why is there a piece of bread on the goat's ass?
[5896.57s -> 5908.66s]  All right. Help me out here. Let's speed run this. Everybody clicked right here.
[5909.62s -> 5916.33s]  There's no goat. The goat's not here. Thank you. No, it's a cat again. The same like 10 people
[5916.33s -> 5934.62s]  clicked on the cat. Okay, that looks good. Are you guys even trying? Somebody is. Come on,
[5934.62s -> 5951.58s]  we need to get to the third level. We need to find the brush. Where's the, where's the
[5951.58s -> 5957.99s]  toothbrush? Whatever kind of brush that is. Found it. Congratulations. You've done it.
[5958.71s -> 5974.44s]  All right, here's it. I gotta, listen. If you guys can get all nine of these
[5975.32s -> 5989.27s]  in nine separate circles, you win. Can you do it? You guys will win. Collectively Chat
[5989.27s -> 5994.73s]  will win the prize. And the prize is you get to see my face on the face cam and I'll wink.
[5995.45s -> 6011.98s]  What a great prize that is. Okay, we got mouse. One, two,
[6012.62s -> 6040.46s]  three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. There's no crow on this list.
[6041.10s -> 6059.18s]  You guys are so close. What's that? That's not even anything either. You guys got that wrong
[6059.26s -> 6074.90s]  too. Two. Holy shit, you guys got a lot wrong. Wow. Oh no, that is right. That's correct.
[6074.90s -> 6082.68s]  Oh, that's correct too. Yeah, you guys didn't, you guys didn't get it. Sorry.
[6083.48s -> 6097.22s]  You wanna try it one more time? Think you have what it takes? I'll give you minutes to look.
[6105.74s -> 6112.14s]  Okay. I want one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight circles. And they only need
[6112.14s -> 6119.74s]  to be on the right thing. And I'm gonna wink at you. Think how cool that reaction gift would
[6119.74s -> 6123.02s]  be. You know, like you're talking to somebody on Twitter and it's like, oh yeah, like that's
[6123.02s -> 6172.92s]  sure. That's definitely my favorite game. I just did it. Get a minute here. Imagine the audacity
[6172.92s -> 6180.86s]  that you would have to put these four in a row on each other. To release it twice.
[6183.69s -> 6191.91s]  Secret Empires, Secret Empires, Aztec, Inca, Maya, and you click the send to Amazon
[6191.91s -> 6208.04s]  purchasing button. Balls. It's actually almost like, that's like almost commendable at that point.
[6208.04s -> 6218.54s]  Okay, here we go. I want nine circles. And if you guys, nine circles, I'll give you a sneeze.
[6219.18s -> 6258.55s]  You can get it. It's coming. Did you get it? Let's try. Oh, I wanted to come up so bad.
[6259.27s -> 6271.77s]  Did you get it? Let's see. All right, we got one, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[6271.77s -> 6312.02s]  Who fucking did this? It's a wasp. That's why. Let's see if you got it. You didn't say they had
[6312.02s -> 6322.95s]  to be correct. What did you think I meant? Just put nine circles? Oh, we have to beat this
[6322.95s -> 6340.25s]  one. Did this last time. Goldfish. I'm gonna give you guys one last chance to get a sneeze.
[6340.25s -> 6349.61s]  I actually don't know where they are. I actually don't know where the fuck they are.
[6350.65s -> 6359.58s]  All right, let's see what happens. Let's see what happens first. Can you guys find the remaining
[6360.90s -> 6365.27s]  four? No, no, no, no, no, not yet. Not yet. We're gonna do this for next time.
[6365.27s -> 6383.67s]  We're gonna have a contest. There's the pipe. Find it. Good work. Where's the moon?
[6383.67s -> 6398.79s]  Find it. Where's the moon? That's a cat. Oh, I could have just looked at that. Where's the
[6398.79s -> 6408.22s]  moon? Holy shit, that was hidden. All right, you guys ready? The next, the goal here for you
[6408.22s -> 6418.31s]  guys is can you find all of these? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight before I
[6418.31s -> 6459.77s]  get to negative 100,000 points. Ready? Go. My hand, my hand is fucking killing me. What did
[6459.77s -> 6490.28s]  I get to? All right, when I get to negative 10,000 points for that, I clicked it. All right,
[6490.28s -> 6496.87s]  did you do it? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. You didn't do it.
[6498.28s -> 6507.54s]  Bird. Mouse. What have you guys done? It's not even correct. Candles.
[6509.38s -> 6512.18s]  Circle. I don't know if that was, but I already clicked it.
[6513.69s -> 6521.98s]  Uh, hook. Water jug. You missed. Uh, I don't know if these are heart and I don't know what that is.
[6521.98s -> 6542.33s]  You missed them. Sorry. I win. Yeah, that's not it. That's not correct. All right,
[6542.33s -> 6553.82s]  if I can find it before you guys, I win. Ready? Go. Got it. I fucking lose.
[6554.54s -> 6568.41s]  All right, that was fun. We're out. This is seriously just dump whatever is in grandma's
[6568.41s -> 6575.78s]  closet after she's owned the house for a hundred years into the living room and figure out what
[6575.78s -> 6581.22s]  you're going to sell and what you're going to, who's going to take what. Well, you know,
[6581.22s -> 6585.86s]  like that, like the four kids, who the fuck is taking the penguin statue? What are we going
[6585.86s -> 6619.53s]  to do with that? That's enough of that. I'm not going to click the other one. You already
[6619.53s -> 6626.39s]  know what it is. Is this again? It's literally the exact same game. They just put a two on
[6627.11s -> 6635.27s]  it. Uh, this game has one review on Amazon. It is a one star review. The person just wrote,
[6635.27s -> 6642.79s]  I can't get it to work. That's the only review on the entire website. So got baited pretty hard
[6642.79s -> 6651.29s]  here, but you know, you got to commit. All right. Uh, what are you, where are we going now?
[6659.78s -> 6673.54s]  No, really? Why do you guys want to do that of all the things to do? Oh my God.
[6674.10s -> 6685.58s]  Somebody just gave a lot of money. Hold on while we sit here for a moment. Uh, thank you to just
[6685.58s -> 6698.33s]  that guy for the $70, $60 right now. And then $10 a few minutes ago. Holy shit, man. Thank you
[6698.33s -> 6710.22s]  for the 70 fucking dollars. Thank you. You say, Jeremy, you legendary shit poster. Of course
[6710.22s -> 6713.82s]  you would do this again, but I would recommend if you really want the chat to make bad
[6713.82s -> 6720.38s]  decisions, you should send them to cool math games. We tried that before and it was a
[6720.38s -> 6729.45s]  disaster. And then you say, try the worst game here and make the chat pay for you to change it.
[6729.45s -> 6739.11s]  That's so terrible. Why would I want to do that? Make, make you pay. Um, if I just,
[6739.11s -> 6744.33s]  okay, first of all, thank you for the $70, but let's go over this for a second here.
[6744.33s -> 6752.70s]  If I sat here like this, right? If I'm sitting here like this and I say, okay guys,
[6752.86s -> 6760.14s]  uh, sorry, but, um, for us to play, uh, another game, you're going to have to give me 50 bucks.
[6761.58s -> 6770.04s]  You just leave. You'd be like, okay, X, I got some laundry. I could probably fucking do.
[6770.04s -> 6773.24s]  I would just sit here and watch the view count drop at like four or 5,000.
[6773.80s -> 6783.67s]  Some of you guys would stay just to see like what would happen, but you just leave. I don't
[6783.67s -> 6789.86s]  know if I don't know. That's a good idea. What the oh. All right. So we're going, uh,
[6796.94s -> 6809.18s]  I can't fucking believe I'm pressing this button, but I am. I just have to press it, right?
[6811.54s -> 6818.42s]  Oh my God. The, the, the ball of koala, thanks to the $50.
[6819.86s -> 6824.79s]  All right, here you go. So that means I have to get off of this.
[6827.00s -> 6831.34s]  He, he's get $50 to get off of this one. It actually worked.
[6832.28s -> 6838.68s]  No, no, you can't pay. You can't pay. What's going on with the camera? You can't, you can't pay
[6838.68s -> 6843.56s]  money to influence what I do on this stream. You understand? If you want to give money,
[6844.12s -> 6849.88s]  thanks, but I can't put that as a precedent because we've got super frog two to play
[6852.66s -> 6863.98s]  everybody X out of the window. No, stay, stay here. Click on your favorite fucking toy.
[6867.14s -> 6869.38s]  Click your favorite toy on here and I'll be able to judge you guys.
[6874.22s -> 6883.64s]  Fox. Cool. That's pretty cool toy. Forget about what, uh, the, the onk. That's the onk, right?
[6884.20s -> 6893.08s]  Okay. Cool. Uh, bottle of wine. That's pretty nice. Gekko. Nice little pet. Uh, bird crow.
[6894.63s -> 6902.74s]  There's a monkey of some sort skull. And I'm surprised no one has clicked on the
[6902.74s -> 6906.84s]  cockroach or the spider or the snail. I would have clicked on the snail
[6911.54s -> 6921.02s]  or the turtle or the sun. Nice work guys. That's it. That's the end of that one.
[6921.02s -> 6924.70s]  So now let's actually get the next one going here because that one was banned,
[6924.70s -> 6941.38s]  but I got paid $50 to do it. What's next? Do I have, do I have time to eat like a
[6941.38s -> 6948.95s]  bowl of spaghetti? I'm going to eat a bowl of spaghetti really fast. Okay. No.
[6951.53s -> 6963.86s]  What's this one? The gorge. What is it? I can't see it. This is, I can't see what this
[6963.86s -> 6976.90s]  is. Baby bird care. Sure. Let's try it. Social eating. No, I'm going to eat it as fast as I can
[6976.90s -> 6984.66s]  downstairs and like get indigestion. Okay. Here we go. Baby bird care is opening and it's
[6984.66s -> 6992.60s]  already having a problem here. I'm not going to switch until I'm certain. Hmm. Maybe. Okay.
[6993.56s -> 7009.80s]  It did open. I don't know if you can see this, but here we go. Wait a minute. Hold on.
[7015.08s -> 7042.55s]  Is this Diablo 2? Honest to God. 800 by 600 and 640 by 480. What an excellent fucking game.
[7042.55s -> 7046.63s]  All right. Here we go. Baby bird care for the baby bird. Change player. Welcome bird.
[7047.43s -> 7052.50s]  He thinks I'm a bird. Okay. That's interesting. Help. Wait for a visitor.
[7052.50s -> 7056.66s]  Drag a baby bird to an empty nest. Release the baby bird to set it down.
[7056.66s -> 7065.26s]  Wait for a visitor. The baby bird wants to sleep. Click on it to sing a song. The baby bird will
[7065.26s -> 7071.42s]  fall asleep. The baby bird awakens. The baby bird wants its parent. Click on it and take the baby
[7071.42s -> 7077.96s]  bird to its parent. The babies have wishes to eat, to drink, to play. To fulfill a wish,
[7077.96s -> 7084.49s]  you should take food from table, water, ball, pickup item and take it to the baby bird.
[7085.45s -> 7091.98s]  There's a kitchen. To prepare food, click on the kitchen to place an order and a bird in a nest.
[7092.70s -> 7097.21s]  The hummingbirds will prepare the food and place it on the table. They have tables.
[7097.85s -> 7106.22s]  To place more orders, click on the kitchen several times. Prepare a drink. Musical instrument.
[7106.86s -> 7111.64s]  Drop items you don't need in it. You can use a musical instrument to put all the babies to
[7111.64s -> 7118.31s]  sleep. And there are bonuses. Mood. Cook. This is the most elaborate one so far.
[7119.27s -> 7130.66s]  2007. We're gonna go on medium level 1-1. No, tutorial. Medium tutorial. I need to know
[7130.66s -> 7135.78s]  what I'm going on. This is first day working in... Today will be my first day working in
[7135.78s -> 7140.18s]  the kindergarten. If I don't do well, I'll be mopping floors the rest of my life.
[7140.18s -> 7149.93s]  So I better listen to my boss. Fuck. Ding dong. This is the first visitor drag a baby
[7149.93s -> 7163.90s]  bird to an empty nest. Wait for the baby bird's wish to appear. It's a food wish.
[7163.90s -> 7170.70s]  You need to arrange some food. Click on the kitchen to place an order. Right. The hummingbirds
[7170.70s -> 7181.48s]  are preparing food now. This is just Diner Dash. But with a Warcraft 3 custom map. Okay,
[7181.48s -> 7189.35s]  it's ready. Click on the table to pick it up. Take the food of the baby. Give it some time
[7189.35s -> 7202.81s]  to eat. Perfect music to do this one. Remember this thing? Remember from Banjo Kazooie? Hold
[7202.81s -> 7222.25s]  on. Remember that one? Takes time to sing a baby to fall asleep. I'm done with this one.
[7225.03s -> 7234.46s]  My fucking ears. Oh, wait. It's a bird daycare. The happier the bird are, the more points you
[7234.46s -> 7238.46s]  earn. Now you're ready for your next visitor. All right. Give me the hardest level in the
[7238.46s -> 7245.24s]  game. Place two orders in the kitchen. There's a... Well, I don't know where the
[7245.24s -> 7252.66s]  doorbell is here, but that's fine. Wait for the wishes to appear.
[7253.38s -> 7297.62s]  Let's fucking go. Eat. Come on. Already got you. Thrash. Are you hungry again? Food? Sleep?
[7297.62s -> 7309.91s]  Same? It was so easy. I was right there. Ready to go. Give it up. Good. Where's the...
[7309.91s -> 7329.93s]  How do I buy things? Food? Got it. We got two now. Ooh, getting tricky. This is getting
[7329.93s -> 7333.99s]  tricky for me. I can't wait to eat that spaghetti. Look, that looks like spaghetti
[7333.99s -> 7337.35s]  to me. That looks like, well, looks like somebody chewed up a bunch of spaghetti and
[7337.35s -> 7342.50s]  then spit it all out. But it still looks like spaghetti. You know what I'm saying?
[7344.18s -> 7361.54s]  Hurry up. Somebody just wrote, why are people not leaving? Why are people not leaving? I mean,
[7361.54s -> 7372.66s]  that is a question. Is it a good question? I don't know. Because people want to see all
[7373.22s -> 7398.92s]  700,000 of them. I got a silver extra level. That's fun. 700,000 games remastered. All right,
[7398.92s -> 7409.59s]  where the hell was that? There's so much more. What happened? Did everybody just change their
[7409.59s -> 7422.86s]  mind immediately? Motorbike. I will never give up. Motorbike. I will never give up.
[7423.74s -> 7431.35s]  It's going to get interesting here. Let me get a bowl of spaghetti. No, not yet. Chess.
[7431.35s -> 7450.18s]  Do you really? Can this be the one that just gets an X? Can you guys vote for the one that
[7450.18s -> 7463.74s]  gets the X? Because chess. Okay, now there's a reason to leave if I open up chess. Who the
[7463.74s -> 7472.89s]  fuck wants to see chess? Apparently half of the people in this chat. You want a rematch?
[7473.77s -> 7483.43s]  Fine. You get your rematch. We're doing this one time. Well, that's all over the place. Well,
[7483.51s -> 7509.77s]  okay. Did I even get to? All right, whatever. It's going to just sit like that.
[7510.73s -> 7512.49s]  Got to get this off the screen. Here's your rematch.
[7520.62s -> 7524.86s]  Okay, so I'm going to, I don't even know what, who am I playing? Are we players?
[7531.58s -> 7561.34s]  Oh, whoops. Okay. Setup. Control. File. Okay. No, no, no. All right, all right, all right.
[7561.34s -> 7567.67s]  Hold on. Let's make this better. Yeah, we already did this and I destroyed chat. It was
[7567.67s -> 7584.33s]  actually really embarrassing. Okay. Here. This is going to take forever.
[7589.13s -> 7600.07s]  This guy is selected. Now where? We already did this. All right. Good move. My turn.
[7600.07s -> 7621.37s]  Do I have to like clock out or something? Oh, what the hell just happened? It's making
[7621.37s -> 7666.65s]  it smaller. What? God. That's not happening. That's not happening. Sorry. I surrender. You
[7666.65s -> 7691.93s]  win. I surrender. Mystery, mystery museum. No, hold on. This looks kind of split between
[7691.93s -> 7700.31s]  mini golf mania and mystery museum. This is a great stream to trim. I'm not going to read
[7700.31s -> 7712.57s]  the rest of that. Now, mystery museum. I just saw it. I think mystery museum is going to
[7712.57s -> 7721.59s]  win. People are still clicking on. No, this is another chess game. No, that's not chess.
[7721.59s -> 7731.08s]  That's checkers. Yeah, I saw it. It was mystery museum. All right, let's open it.
[7739.78s -> 7746.33s]  Mystery museum. Thank you for voting. Let us click on your face. Okay. A little bit later.
[7746.33s -> 7750.90s]  Not right now. All right. What's your runner? This that this actually opens.
[7752.52s -> 7786.70s]  It did. Wow. Holy shit. That was so painless. Oh, he is just all hidden object games.
[7786.70s -> 7804.90s]  That's when you see it. I need to know if okay, if they're all all of them are
[7804.90s -> 7809.38s]  fucking hidden object games. I remember this. Watch this. This is the one right next to it.
[7809.38s -> 7814.66s]  This is haunted house. Yeah. Oh, scary. It's the same thing with like a mummy this time.
[7814.66s -> 7827.11s]  A really small mummy. A mummy that is not even like three feet tall. That's scary.
[7835.38s -> 7839.54s]  It sure is. All right. Let's just get this over with. This is the next one. It's cryptic
[7839.54s -> 7857.16s]  castle. Oh, I wonder what it's going to be. Yes. Oh, okay. Cool. There's like 15 hidden
[7857.16s -> 7864.18s]  object games in the same. Look at that badass up there. Surfing on a broom.
[7868.87s -> 7878.22s]  That's a T pose. Surfing on a broomstick. Witch. And it was what we needed to click on.
[7878.78s -> 7892.62s]  That's all I needed to see. That was cryptic castle. This is ghostly garden. It's the
[7892.62s -> 7897.66s]  same fucking game. There's no difference. In fact, there's the tiny mummy again.
[7898.62s -> 7908.04s]  Same music too. See, I wasn't bullshitting. Those of you guys that watched the video on
[7908.04s -> 7926.12s]  the first 700,000. This is the second, part two, second game. I wasn't lying. It's the
[7926.12s -> 7935.78s]  witch again. Is it weird that I want that as an emote? Is that illegal? It might be illegal,
[7935.78s -> 7950.63s]  but I want this. It's probably, honestly, this whole game is probably ripped off from
[7950.79s -> 7958.87s]  Google images anyways. I wonder if I can find this image. Some of you guys that use the internet,
[7958.87s -> 7962.87s]  that know exactly what the fuck you're doing. See if you can track this down,
[7962.87s -> 7975.51s]  see where it's actually from. Okay. So that was, I can't, I cannot believe it's the same
[7975.51s -> 7999.54s]  fucking game. That's unfucking believable. Selling a sequel. There's no sequel. Did
[7999.54s -> 8016.95s]  somebody already find it? You did not. That's not it. That's not the right one.
[8019.32s -> 8027.91s]  I'm not, I'm not clicking until I'm certain, because these are going to be gnomes.
[8031.93s -> 8042.04s]  Crazy witch surfing on her broomstick. I'm not clicking on a gnome and I'm not
[8042.04s -> 8049.86s]  clicking on porn. All right. Can one of the mods, let me know if any of these are real
[8049.86s -> 8055.54s]  before I gnome myself on stream for like the 30th time. By the way, where are we going?
[8055.54s -> 8082.62s]  What happened? Checkers. 700,000 games too. I'll never, I can't get over this.
[8091.38s -> 8102.01s]  You want to play checkers? All right. It looks like we're playing checkers,
[8102.01s -> 8117.59s]  but no, I don't even, why do I want to play checkers? Checkers? Don't worry. Don't worry.
[8117.59s -> 8130.55s]  Everyone that's concerned about checkers, it don't even open. It doesn't even open.
[8130.55s -> 8139.75s]  No, it don't open. So scratch that off the list. 3D checkers doesn't open. Sorry,
[8139.75s -> 8153.50s]  I know everyone's really disappointed. Liar. I'm not a liar. That, I can't open it.
[8153.50s -> 8168.06s]  Just restart your computer and try again. Oh my god. It works on my PC. You don't own that
[8168.06s -> 8174.98s]  game. Nobody does. Me and the one guy that bought the game that gave it a one-star rating
[8174.98s -> 8183.51s]  own this game. All right. Looks like we're going to mania. Golf mania, which is down here.
[8186.26s -> 8198.90s]  Mini golf mania 3D. Will you open? So interesting enough, all the games,
[8198.90s -> 8202.26s]  look, we'll do this in real time. Any game that has the word 3D in it.
[8205.18s -> 8228.55s]  You ready? Here we are. If it has 3D in the title, it does not open. I wonder why that is.
[8231.19s -> 8237.53s]  Hmm. Interesting. Update your graphics card.
[8240.62s -> 8250.12s]  You clicked on an image. Yeah, I gotta, I'm sorry guys. It's, but I gotta update my graphics card.
[8250.12s -> 8260.71s]  Go again, try again. The same issues from the last one. No, I can't click that one. Do it
[8260.71s -> 8273.21s]  again. It does, I, that one doesn't work. No, no, the one, this, okay, fine. Back game in 3D.
[8273.85s -> 8301.54s]  What do you know? Hey, look backgammon 3D. You see? Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Which has been found?
[8301.54s -> 8314.57s]  Is my computer lagging? I don't even know how to play backgammon. No, wait, wait, wait. You
[8314.57s -> 8343.96s]  found the image. No fucking way. Oh, unbelievable. I can't fucking believe you found it. Hold on.
[8350.66s -> 8354.20s]  How did you find this that quickly?
[8366.74s -> 8386.20s]  Unbelievable. But where did that come from? And did they have permission to put it in their game?
[8390.04s -> 8410.70s]  No way. Guaranteed no. Guaranteed no. Is it the right witch? Hold on. That, who,
[8410.78s -> 8420.36s]  nobody plays backgammon. No one. Who cares about backgammon? It doesn't make any sense.
[8422.34s -> 8440.42s]  Bye. See you later. All right. Let's, and this is very important, actually. Let's see.
[8441.38s -> 8444.66s]  Okay. For a second, I was like freaking out. Yeah. I saved it to the desktop.
[8444.66s -> 8458.31s]  So there it is. This file is 27 kilobytes. All right. Hold on. Hold on. This is important.
[8458.95s -> 8465.03s]  I need to open up this way. We need to see if it's the right witch.
[8465.03s -> 8468.81s]  That's actually pretty important. That is the right witch. I don't even know why we're doing
[8468.81s -> 8472.97s]  this. You know how much time, there's so much that we still have to go through.
[8472.97s -> 8498.12s]  And I'm doing this shit right now. She's not here. We have to beat this level. Edit the
[8498.12s -> 8524.89s]  snort over her face. Why is that so funny? I got to get rid of the white.
[8547.72s -> 8558.04s]  Where's the witch? So we can compare the image. I don't see the witch anywhere.
[8558.04s -> 8570.82s]  I just need to like, just skip everything. It's the castle game. Wrong game. Middle left of
[8570.82s -> 8577.61s]  screen. I don't see the witch anywhere. What are you talking about? It's there at all. It's
[8577.61s -> 8583.37s]  not, guys, everyone that's saying that I'm an idiot. You have to remember these are all the
[8583.37s -> 8589.05s]  same fucking video game. The assets are the same across the entire five game catalog.
[8590.01s -> 8605.85s]  Just scorpion. Where's this? We're just gonna get to the next level. Scorpion found the bread.
[8607.29s -> 8612.57s]  One more. Crossbones and scorpion. Scorpion. Crossbones. Got it. Okay, here we go.
[8642.57s -> 8656.44s]  Is it? It's not the same image. This is not the same image. That's impossible. I don't
[8656.44s -> 8691.77s]  believe it. No fucking way. It's a different. It's a different witch. Another one. No fucking
[8691.85s -> 8708.57s]  way. I refuse to believe there's another one. There's no way. Oh my god. There's another one.
[8710.34s -> 8719.34s]  Oh my god. But it's not the right one. That's not correct. Guys, that's not correct.
[8721.32s -> 8735.94s]  It's not the right one. Look, it's not correct. You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[8737.42s -> 8759.42s]  Hold on a second. Are you guys ready for this shit? It's a different witch.
[8768.71s -> 8772.25s]  I need to flip. We need to transform it. It's not the same.
[8782.73s -> 8801.62s]  We need to get it out there. Exactly. I need to transform it. Oh, get this out of the way.
[8802.26s -> 8815.45s]  Is it the same image? How do I rotate this? How can these be different images though?
[8815.45s -> 8823.26s]  That's the thing I don't fucking understand. It has edits on it so they didn't get fucking sued.
[8825.61s -> 8831.91s]  Is this the same person? I can't. I don't know if this is even the same. The broom is
[8831.91s -> 8855.93s]  a different direction. It's been photoshopped and it's blurry. Hold on. I need to fucking
[8855.93s -> 8902.58s]  fix this. No, I can't. I can't do it. The hat is different. It's so fucking pixelated
[8902.58s -> 8918.42s]  it's almost impossible to tell. But look at the hat though. I think they just like smeared it
[8918.42s -> 8931.00s]  in Photoshop. It's a mix of the two images. Did her mouth just move?
[8932.44s -> 8943.56s]  The one on the right's mouth just moved. What the fuck? I'm scared by itself.
[8944.36s -> 8955.70s]  Okay, I need to get out of this. Turn these off. That's actually unfucking believable though.
[8959.46s -> 8972.58s]  My god. Wait a minute. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. No, don't do this to me. No,
[8972.58s -> 9024.28s]  don't do this to me. Somebody just cropped this from this stream. It's a screenshot of
[9024.28s -> 9043.10s]  this stream. Where the fuck are we going? We are a fucking ton of money came in. Hold on a
[9043.10s -> 9059.72s]  second. Frillity. Frillity. Thanks for the $50. I love this witch game. I don't know how
[9059.72s -> 9065.35s]  you guys found that that quickly. Was it as easy as just... Wait, no. Okay, hold on.
[9065.35s -> 9069.35s]  Thank you so much for the $50. It's time for slime. Thank you for the $50.
[9071.18s -> 9075.91s]  There's another image here. At this point, I don't know which one is fake and which one
[9075.91s -> 9086.98s]  is real. Thank you for the $50. It's time for slime and for litty and just that guy gave
[9086.98s -> 9099.22s]  $40, $50 on top of like $100 plus $130, $140. Jesus Christ. That's an absolute insane amount
[9099.22s -> 9104.49s]  of money. Thank you guys. How do I vote? Just click the screen. This is how you vote.
[9106.47s -> 9115.11s]  Yeah, that was fun. Thank you. Thank you so much. Oh, look what we got here. Right.
[9115.11s -> 9123.24s]  Probably should take that off. All right. Thank you for the dick that was on the screen.
[9123.24s -> 9129.37s]  That's very, very appropriate. So what was that? I don't remember where we even were.
[9134.15s -> 9138.90s]  I don't know what that was. What was that? What's the last thing we did?
[9139.62s -> 9146.34s]  It was back in 3D. Okay. So are you guys going to behave? Can I turn it back on?
[9147.06s -> 9164.23s]  Please. There's another one. I can't tell if this is... I mean, there's another one.
[9164.23s -> 9173.72s]  There's another witch image here. There's another one? This is crazy. Hold on. Let me
[9173.72s -> 9181.08s]  just like show this on stream for a second. This is like kind of wild here. You know what
[9181.08s -> 9187.93s]  I'm saying? Hold on. You guys are still finding these images. It's actually pretty...
[9188.49s -> 9195.24s]  This one is pretty shocking. That's kind of ridiculous. I mean, there's so many of these.
[9195.24s -> 9210.39s]  Wow. Where did you find that one? There's so many. Is there some website? Is there
[9210.39s -> 9214.31s]  gotta be some website that you're going to to be able to create these, to see these?
[9216.17s -> 9219.85s]  Witch on broom with scary face. That's the number one result.
[9224.36s -> 9240.84s]  Interesting. All right. What are we playing? Amph... Amphric, thanks for the five community subs.
[9242.02s -> 9245.14s]  You tried to make another deck and you failed. I don't even know where you guys are going with
[9245.14s -> 9250.26s]  this. So I'm going to pick one that's in the middle. I see air ball and mystic demon
[9250.26s -> 9256.34s]  between the two nuts is the shaft of the penis. And I'm going to pick one that's in
[9256.34s -> 9260.39s]  there because the, you know, you've read what you sell. So we're going to go with,
[9262.97s -> 9272.20s]  uh, we're going to go with air ball, air ball. Here we go. Thanks for voting.
[9272.20s -> 9291.02s]  Let's see if this one works. It does. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Maybe it doesn't. No,
[9291.02s -> 9329.11s]  it does. What is, what is this on the screen? Oh, it's because I can't even turn it off.
[9329.11s -> 9347.88s]  I can't even get out of this. All right. Get off. It's because this capture is all
[9347.88s -> 9356.07s]  fucked up. Oh my goodness. Reset it. There we go. Okay. Okay. I'm ready.
[9357.70s -> 9364.81s]  Why did the music just drastically fucking change? Oh, the music is so bad and loud.
[9365.77s -> 9382.95s]  What happened? I'm not even going to attempt to fix the,
[9384.22s -> 9387.18s]  I'm not going to even attempt to fix the fucking screen here. I can't even leave the
[9387.18s -> 9394.74s]  window. Look at what does that do? Okay. Logan, log in, new game, save game, new game.
[9394.74s -> 9404.02s]  Choose your pad. Whoa. One, one. That's my desktop background and it's just a mirror.
[9404.90s -> 9412.36s]  How lazy do you have to be? That's the ultimate in laziness. You just mirrored one image to make a
[9412.36s -> 9423.82s]  giant screen. Why wouldn't you just get a picture that was big enough to fit? Why? What am I,
[9423.82s -> 9441.26s]  I'm a penguin? No, I'm not the penguin. Oh, it's just brick breaker. This one's really fun
[9441.26s -> 9467.40s]  actually. Oops. Sorry. It's kind of hard to control though. Ah, I thought I could make it.
[9468.90s -> 9488.26s]  Oh, somebody here thought that was funny. I can't even hear anything.
[9490.90s -> 9498.82s]  There we go. Kill the penguin. I'm about to. The penguin's about to be dead.
[9499.62s -> 9514.34s]  Gotta maximize the shot. Beautiful. What? It's not a real penguin, guys. It's a digital,
[9514.34s -> 9522.54s]  it's a digital copy. Well, that's a perfect copy. It's not a real penguin.
[9523.10s -> 9539.00s]  This is just, in bowling, this is the worst thing you can possibly do.
[9550.76s -> 9554.12s]  Excellent. Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it. I'm the bat.
[9554.76s -> 9577.99s]  That one's fucking dumb. It was fun though. It was okay. So that brings us to where, where
[9577.99s -> 9598.23s]  the heck was that? Air ball. It was just holding you back. Yeah, I agree. Oh, I'm
[9598.23s -> 9605.40s]  gonna get spaghetti. All right, we're almost at the three hour mark and we're, we're, you
[9605.40s -> 9612.42s]  know, we're almost like 30% to 40% of the way there. So I'm gonna just, I'm gonna eat
[9612.42s -> 9619.70s]  spaghetti. I'll be back in probably 45. I'm just kidding. Motorbike Racing is the one.
[9621.02s -> 9631.19s]  Motorbike Racing. Is it the one? Yeah, it looks like it. Extreme Motorbike Racing.
[9637.18s -> 9641.98s]  I think this one was also in, all of them were. I'm just, I'm watching one of my
[9641.98s -> 9648.10s]  favorite movies that I haven't seen in a long time. That's what's happening right now.
[9649.90s -> 9657.42s]  Extreme Motorbike Racing, prepare for the crash. That's inevitable. Let's see what happens.
[9668.04s -> 9669.80s]  I can't tell you, I don't know how loud this is.
[9676.79s -> 9689.11s]  We're good. Can you see it? By the way, I just came to this realization. Turn the music off.
[9694.86s -> 9717.74s]  You just contendo, Nintendo, contendo. Okay. Can you guys, I don't even know if you guys can see.
[9718.54s -> 9725.16s]  I have no idea. Every other monitor is black. This is apparently 1920 by 1080.
[9727.24s -> 9740.58s]  Okay. I don't think I agree. Okay, here we go. Start game. Yes, I remember this one. Race
[9740.58s -> 9748.98s]  two. Race three. Fruising. No entrance fee. Race three. Yeah, I remember this one. This one sucks.
[9750.26s -> 9763.90s]  Automatic transmission. Let's go. Holy shit. It is, it is 1920 by 1080.
[9764.54s -> 9768.71s]  Yeah, this is one where I just drove into the wall. What? That's my favorite movie.
[9769.27s -> 9784.58s]  Look at how you do that though. How do you do that? How do you make that happen?
[9785.22s -> 9789.22s]  This is just a taxi driver coming. Yeah, it probably is.
[9789.22s -> 9813.67s]  How did I get on one wheel? Oh my god. I, oh no. Space nitro is control. Handbrake is space
[9813.67s -> 9825.80s]  nitro control. Horn H toggle lights. Nice desktop. All right, so we're gonna have to do,
[9825.80s -> 9845.40s]  we need C L H N control. Control. There it is. Remember this? Remember this part of the video?
[9846.36s -> 9870.07s]  I do. Let me actually like, I'm dropping in game currency. I lost. Fruising. He, I, he did
[9870.07s -> 9882.98s]  the thing, but from the video? So this is just cruising around. I think I tried to go like
[9882.98s -> 9896.57s]  5,000 miles per hour last time. Well, it's still going. Let's try it again. You have nitro,
[9896.57s -> 9903.02s]  you can pin a nitro on it, but you can do it straight away. This is not really a good
[9903.02s -> 9917.19s]  straight away. It's the mountains. Handbrake. Come on. Then I can do the joke. Yeah. I would
[9917.19s -> 9925.51s]  call this one the most complete video game though. Don't you think? That didn't happen.
[9925.51s -> 9930.71s]  That, that's patched version two. The one thing that they fixed in the game.
[9935.70s -> 9952.14s]  The loudest water sound ever heard. It's turning. I'm going to hit it again.
[9953.02s -> 9958.26s]  I need to hit five hundred miles per hour. Oh my fucking god. This is actually starting
[9958.26s -> 9977.42s]  to aggravate me. Wheelie on slopes. That's probably a good idea. Straight away? I can't
[9977.42s -> 9987.03s]  from this far away. No, no, not yet. Don't punch it yet. I got to get a complete straight away,
[9987.59s -> 9994.78s]  which is no, not yet. He's being back seated on 700,000 games.
[9999.10s -> 10006.89s]  Punch it. Okay. Stop. Slow down. This hurts my fucking head.
[10010.33s -> 10027.19s]  How is second gear 200 miles per hour? It's straight away. I just wish it wouldn't be this
[10027.19s -> 10045.03s]  long. Oh shit. It's so hard to control when you're going that fast. Last attempt.
[10045.83s -> 10057.43s]  Are they more than two gears? I don't know. They might be straight away.
[10062.58s -> 10068.26s]  Really? I don't fucking believe that for a second. How could you not have the gas
[10068.26s -> 10089.16s]  station blow up? Still going? Yeah, it's just going down the street. Can I open the map?
[10089.32s -> 10094.92s]  I mean, I know I shouldn't care this much about this, but I do. I need to do the joke.
[10098.10s -> 10115.16s]  Otherwise this is a different movie. Reverse? I probably, yeah, I can go in reverse. Here we go.
[10115.16s -> 10136.22s]  Straight away. This is it. You ready for the joke? That wasn't as good as the first movie.
[10136.86s -> 10146.84s]  First movie was better. There's a jump here though. Why would you put a jump there and
[10146.84s -> 10172.31s]  not let me go over it? It's the same shot. I know, right? What happened? What? I last drive
[10172.31s -> 10181.43s]  into a wall. LOL moment. Nerdy. Here it comes. Whatever. It's done. Stream motorbike racing sucks.
[10183.24s -> 10189.42s]  Wait, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Right back where we left it off.
[10193.91s -> 10197.83s]  Wait, this is a new movie. This movie's new. I haven't seen this movie before.
[10198.63s -> 10230.39s]  We've got a sequel. What the fuck is overhead right now?
[10231.35s -> 10249.66s]  It's a casual zeppelin flying overhead. There you go. That was it. Thanks for playing.
[10252.76s -> 10264.38s]  I don't even know what that was. What the fuck is it? I don't know where it is.
[10268.46s -> 10279.62s]  Where is it? Extreme motor. There it is. Okay. All right. Well, you guys vote for the next one.
[10279.62s -> 10284.07s]  I'm going to go grab some spaghetti. I'll be right back. I'm not doing that one again.
[10284.07s -> 10290.23s]  Restart. Sorry. I'll be back in like two minutes. I'm not going to do BRB.
[10291.03s -> 10620.78s]  Hey, that's pretty nice caterpillar or car. So it looks like I get it. Hey, it's streamers choice.
[10624.52s -> 10629.35s]  You know what that means? I get to go anywhere in there and I think we're going to do
[10629.35s -> 10644.10s]  parking lot parking lot maze. Thanks for voting. Parking lot maze. Welcome back.
[10644.10s -> 10649.54s]  I'm like, I just ran up the stairs. I ate spaghetti with my hands and then came up and
[10649.54s -> 10688.65s]  ran up the stairs. All right. What do we got here? Actually, I can drag the bottom.
[10689.37s -> 10702.06s]  It's the first one I've been able to do that with. This music sucks.
[10702.94s -> 10724.41s]  Turn it down. I don't know what the point was to do that. I'm sorry. All right. Start here.
[10724.41s -> 10731.24s]  Monopoly. It's Fortnite Monopoly. Welcome to parking lot maze. Parking lot maze is a,
[10731.32s -> 10740.10s]  come on. That's not even. Did you even try? I would see that and change that and fix that.
[10741.64s -> 10746.20s]  Highly addictive puzzle game where your goal is to untangle the vehicles and restore traffic
[10746.20s -> 10755.05s]  within the streets of Strestropolis. Strestropolis. Move the vehicles by clicking
[10755.05s -> 10760.25s]  on them and clicking on an empty tile. I don't know what that says. However,
[10760.25s -> 10774.71s]  you cannot move. I played this. It's just this thing. What? Yeah, I did it. The stress
[10774.71s -> 10789.29s]  meter. Don't let stress meter fill up or you will lose a life. That's okay. Don't get stressed
[10789.29s -> 10797.05s]  out and lose your life in traffic. Oh my God. That's fucking horrible. Okay. I got out.
[10797.21s -> 10806.55s]  Got out of traffic. Solve. If you can't get it, you can just solve. I'm pretty,
[10806.55s -> 10815.72s]  I'm pretty good at this shit. Multiple goals. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I get you.
[10830.58s -> 10831.62s]  I know what I'm doing here, guys.
[10863.67s -> 10888.65s]  Oh, he's so good. He's so fast at everything he does. I like this. This is fun. What a
[10888.65s -> 10972.94s]  fucking terrible game. No. Yeah. You guys fucked it up. Hold on. Just my face. That's
[10972.94s -> 11012.14s]  got to be bigger so you guys can actually click on it. Where am I? You do, you do a dick on my
[11012.14s -> 11033.16s]  face one more time and I'll play chess again for the next six hours. Is that what you want? Holy
[11033.16s -> 11037.40s]  shit. Wow. You're actually listening. All right. Let's get one more time. Nice and close.
[11059.48s -> 11076.74s]  Yeah. Now you lose privileges for the next 10 years. What? I turned it off. Oh, it's because
[11076.74s -> 11091.34s]  it's on the other scene. I get it. Okay. Where are we going? That was a car in the lot.
[11091.34s -> 11119.37s]  Bust out 3D world. It's either, well, bust out 3D world or alchemy drop. Okay. Looks like
[11119.37s -> 11129.32s]  alchemy drop. Let's play alchemy drop. Sure. Alchemy drop. Why am I, can I say that in a
[11129.32s -> 11134.74s]  different tone or is it the same audio clip? Alchemy drop, alchemy drop, alchemy drop,
[11134.74s -> 11143.98s]  alchemy drop. I can't do it. Alchemy drop, alchemy drop. There we go. Finally. Jesus.
[11147.59s -> 11152.78s]  Alchemy drop. It's going to, I know this is going to be a match three game. We're
[11152.78s -> 11157.50s]  going to be quitting it in two seconds. I'm reliving the nightmare I had last time
[11157.50s -> 11213.22s]  in real time, live on camera. Fuck. I can't believe I'm doing this shit again.
[11213.22s -> 11219.24s]  If you had told me three years ago that fast forward a couple of years and there was going
[11219.24s -> 11224.04s]  to be another edition of this game that was supposed to be different and it was the same
[11224.04s -> 11234.12s]  thing and I'm doing it again. Bust out world. All right. It's time to, it's time to start
[11234.12s -> 11241.67s]  picking on myself for the next couple of rounds. Everybody wants to put a little dinky
[11241.67s -> 11249.75s]  on the screen. All right. Let's go. Bust out 3D world. It's a 3D game. That means it's
[11249.75s -> 11262.84s]  not going to work. You can try it though. It doesn't work. Hey, at least we're going
[11262.84s -> 11267.40s]  through it quicker because the ones that, I wonder if it's the same ones that don't work.
[11267.40s -> 11270.68s]  That would be hilarious actually. I need to go watch that video after this.
[11285.54s -> 11289.22s]  Farmer crates is 3D and it works and it's from the video.
[11294.89s -> 11313.61s]  Let's take us back. Oh, Jerma, you really cashed in on that video you made. All right.
[11313.61s -> 11322.02s]  We're going to play Farmer, Farmer crates. Did I get this game for one cent? I got this
[11322.02s -> 11332.70s]  game for, I think it was $11. Farmer crates did work in the last timeline. So let's see
[11332.70s -> 11341.90s]  if it works in this one. Of course it does because this is the exact same collection
[11341.90s -> 11348.84s]  and why is it opening on my other monitor? I am so confused. It's opening on my right
[11348.84s -> 11356.50s]  monitor right now. This is not correct. So I'm going to put it into windowed.
[11363.66s -> 11381.62s]  There's, there it is. It's another song. I don't know what it is. I don't want to play this again.
[11382.34s -> 11388.18s]  Can I skip? Can I veto this one? I've already done it. I already know what this one is.
[11388.18s -> 11393.83s]  I've already played this one. Remember? Oh, wow. Look at that face that guy has. It's a
[11393.83s -> 11400.60s]  really scary face. He looks like a character from the Dark Crystal. I don't know whatever
[11400.60s -> 11409.77s]  I said. Some reference. Joe, that's fine. I've done it. You've played all of them. Not all of
[11409.77s -> 11414.41s]  them. Some of these didn't work. Some of these actually did not open. A lot of them didn't.
[11415.45s -> 11426.81s]  Deja vu. No, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Good reference. Right.
[11434.30s -> 11442.18s]  What is it? Three, two, one. And what is going on with this guy's work outfit? What?
[11442.18s -> 11462.68s]  This guy puts on overalls and shoes to go to work and he's naked. Three, two, one. I mean,
[11463.24s -> 11469.42s]  three, two, one. I mean, like, this guy belongs in a different video game. You know,
[11469.42s -> 11487.82s]  he belongs in, he belongs in the Dark Crystal from the Muppets. I don't have any, I don't
[11487.82s -> 11508.94s]  know what else to say. Oh, I fucked that up. Oh, Dobby. Dobby. Harry. Harry Potter.
[11515.88s -> 11541.30s]  Did I do that one? Jeez. I thought, I thought this was going to be like a big deal.
[11541.30s -> 11545.22s]  It was going to be a different thing, but it's just, no, no, no. It is a big deal. It is a big
[11545.22s -> 11557.56s]  deal. And you guys thought that was it. You guys thought that there wasn't more. I thought
[11557.56s -> 11578.10s]  there is more. Vegas Slot. This 4500 Vegas Slot. Oh, I'm doing that right now. This is
[11578.10s -> 11604.23s]  streamers choice, guys. Sorry. Virtual Vegas Slot. So name guest player, name Bank Robert.
[11604.23s -> 11609.53s]  No, not Bank Robber. Bank Roll. Bank Roll. Whatever. Who cares? It's a fucking, this
[11609.53s -> 11633.70s]  game isn't stupid. Choose game and almost, it's coming. No, it was going to sneeze.
[11634.34s -> 11638.82s]  All right. $100 super bets. I get $5,000. If you go hard, you fucking just go home.
[11639.46s -> 11644.58s]  I'm going to go five real and we're going to do, I don't know, Dinosaur Dollars.
[11644.58s -> 11649.38s]  Dinosaur Dollars blast him up. $100 bets. Deposit money into the machine.
[11649.38s -> 11710.89s]  Where's my bankroll? What happened? All right, let's do it again. Let's do $100. And we're
[11710.89s -> 11718.70s]  going to go to Chocolate Lover. Oh, I don't know. Okay. Deposit money. $5,000. Deposit.
[11719.58s -> 11728.73s]  Choose how many lines I want. All of, all lines. Every line. All lines. 20 lines.
[11728.73s -> 11734.52s]  20 lines. It's $100 per line. That's how much is that for one spin?
[11738.02s -> 11744.49s]  That's, how much is that? That's 20. That's $2,000.
[11752.10s -> 11757.22s]  I lost like 1400 bucks.
[11771.45s -> 11808.10s]  Some Y outs. Give me some Y outs. I got like 10 grand on this credit card. This is it.
[11812.10s -> 11901.24s]  Multi-millionaire tower of cash. Super sports. Do it. Those machines are stupid.
[11901.24s -> 11907.24s]  Everybody knows the best machine at the casino is Betty White's fairy tales.
[11907.56s -> 11913.40s]  Or the Ellen DeGeneres dance machine. Everybody knows that. They don't even fucking have those.
[11913.40s -> 11946.10s]  So worst slot machine ever. Cheddar, Cheddar Fool. I don't, uh, looks like everyone wants
[11946.10s -> 11964.87s]  me to play Cheddar Fool. Circular Pool. Okay, that's what that says. Right. I've
[11964.87s -> 11970.31s]  waited three hours for Circular Pool. Well, I really hate to tell you this,
[11970.31s -> 11975.19s]  but there is like a 40% chance that it doesn't work. Let's have some faith.
[11975.99s -> 11994.36s]  Oh, you just have to have a little bit of faith. Cheddar Fool. Let's open it. Let's go.
[12019.70s -> 12053.75s]  Balls are shmeez. And there's coins. You guys see this shit? Blue surface.
[12058.28s -> 12062.94s]  Boxcar Bob. Boxcar Bob is going to break. Move the window. I can't,
[12063.74s -> 12068.78s]  I physically can't do it. Yeah. I, if I'm, I'm going to side to side of the screen here
[12068.78s -> 12096.78s]  and this is a crash computer game. I'll try it. I'm going to try it. Let me know how this looks.
[12107.13s -> 12117.11s]  Better? All right. Boxcar Bob. This is cool. It's like a breakup with pool.
[12117.91s -> 12125.10s]  This is really cool. Oh, you just have to like curling. You just got to get it out of
[12125.10s -> 12132.87s]  the way. It's like sumo wrestling. All right. So what, what is he? Which one am I?
[12133.99s -> 12147.75s]  Does it matter? How do I control the ball? The ball is just stuck on the,
[12148.47s -> 12157.46s]  I can't move the ball into the center. It's always going to go off the side of the screen.
[12161.80s -> 12174.82s]  Um, arrow keys. No, it's not the arrow keys. I'm moving the mouse.
[12186.89s -> 12198.50s]  Okay. There we go. Oh, wait a minute. I get it. So it's up and down and left and right.
[12199.14s -> 12207.37s]  The one thing that I really, you know, chat sometimes it's just so
[12207.37s -> 12232.68s]  fucking irritating. Oh, you've just hit me. You struck me. Bully. All right. I'm going to get
[12232.68s -> 12251.93s]  this one. Watch this one in the corner pocket. Uh, I think this is going to work. We got to
[12251.93s -> 12272.12s]  go again, right? This music's making me depressed. Why? What an idiot. That's a free
[12272.12s -> 12295.91s]  ball. Nice one, Bob. Is that the AI helping me? That's it. I won the game. He knocked in the,
[12295.91s -> 12304.84s]  the eight ball. I win. Get out of here. See you later. Thanks for the free victory.
[12305.64s -> 12338.65s]  That's it. It's time for me. Yeah. Oh, I can do that better. Oh, you want to fight?
[12338.65s -> 12360.31s]  You want to fuck fight? Don't fuck come at me. Don't. Oh, I went too far. I was,
[12360.31s -> 12367.29s]  I was looking at the camera. I actually fucked that one up and that's all right.
[12367.93s -> 12372.90s]  Oh no, I need to see that. I have to see that. I was, that was a mistake.
[12373.62s -> 12380.44s]  You didn't mean to do that one. My hand went too far and I didn't react fast enough.
[12380.44s -> 12385.91s]  Did that actually just- No, that wasn't the right one. Don't fuck come at me.
[12395.06s -> 12401.85s]  Holy shit. That, oh my God. That actually just happened. Wow. Oh, you want to fight?
[12402.79s -> 12412.79s]  Don't fuck come at me. Holy shit. Yeah, I did not actually mean to do that.
[12413.43s -> 12418.82s]  I was trying to time it with the kid. That was me actually doing that. Well, that was fun.
[12420.94s -> 12435.30s]  I can't fucking believe that just happened. I was trying to do this joke where my hand
[12435.30s -> 12446.39s]  comes all the way across and I turn and I turned it. I didn't turn at the right time.
[12446.39s -> 12456.71s]  Well, that was, that was the worst part about that is the noise still happens.
[12461.67s -> 12481.75s]  The fake joke noise still plays on top of it. Where the fuck is that? Unbelievable. I haven't
[12481.75s -> 12490.47s]  even been drinking. I've had like coffee and food. I'll never live that one down.
[12491.27s -> 12499.14s]  That'll be a clip that's posted forever. God damn it. Unbelievable.
[12499.14s -> 12519.90s]  What the fuck am I going to do about that one? You want to fight? Don't fuck come at me.
[12521.48s -> 12531.67s]  Oh my God. That's this so much regret here right now. I can't fucking believe that that happened.
[12531.67s -> 12536.14s]  Oh, no. God.
[12542.04s -> 12548.33s]  Of all the things to accidentally do, I would have rather shit my pants on stream
[12548.33s -> 12566.39s]  because at least like I got a stomach ache and I shit my pants and there's gonna be so
[12566.39s -> 12571.26s]  many people that think that that was on purpose and like how why would you not think
[12571.26s -> 12575.50s]  that? But why would I do that? Like there's so many layers to how awful that just was.
[12581.48s -> 12586.89s]  Fucking unbelievable. I can imagine the people that are already typing it right now like
[12586.89s -> 12590.57s]  he just did that on purpose. What a fucking idiot. Like trying to get views. I know.
[12590.57s -> 12598.25s]  I'm just, I'm just stupid. God damn it. What have I done?
[12602.17s -> 12622.44s]  All right, vote on the next one. How am I going to explain that one to mom?
[12630.74s -> 12635.78s]  Yeah, Jeremy, I was watching a clip on Twitch of you slapping yourself in the face.
[12636.18s -> 12645.51s]  Why did you do that? Mom, I, I don't know how it happened but it did.
[12645.51s -> 12649.43s]  That's people gonna edit that in places and it's gonna, oh my God. What the fuck.
[12651.19s -> 12655.83s]  You can hear the embarrassment in my voice. Where's this going? 3D fucking circle pool.
[12662.04s -> 12666.92s]  What did I do? Because I was pretending to miss the person in front of me and go around like
[12666.92s -> 12672.44s]  a fucking three stooges video and I actually did the three stooges thing in real life.
[12682.04s -> 12685.32s]  So it looks like we're going to classic, classic Pac-Man.
[12696.07s -> 12703.96s]  Don't take it seriously. I mean, how can I at this point? All right, here we go.
[12703.96s -> 12716.63s]  We're gonna go to classic Pac-Man. Ow, my ears. Okay, this is advertising a website.
[12718.87s -> 12725.29s]  Oh yeah, I forgot. Yeah, this is the one with the monsters. Remember I'm like, oh,
[12725.29s -> 12748.42s]  there's cars instead of ghosts. It's the same game. Well, I can fix that. Classic.
[12751.05s -> 12758.23s]  Watch out for the monster. Yeah, it's the same. It's just Pac-Man and it's,
[12758.23s -> 12761.35s]  don't go to that website. There's no reason for you to go to that website.
[12761.99s -> 12779.22s]  Although Pac-Man, seriously, the fact that if you remove Pac-Man's eyes,
[12779.94s -> 12790.66s]  he really is just fucking terrifying. What a scary fucking monster he really is with no eyes.
[12801.99s -> 12806.25s]  Pac-Man didn't have eyes? Didn't have a little, little like eye? Well, that's
[12806.25s -> 12823.77s]  like a clay version. Maybe, did he not have eyes? No, he didn't. What was it? Was it 1995
[12823.77s -> 12830.42s]  when they gave him eyes? Yeah, don't go to that website. Why, I just told you not to go. Why
[12830.42s -> 12835.66s]  would you go? Hey, I just went to that website and I fucked up my computer. Don't do that.
[12843.46s -> 12851.66s]  If these games are free, why would they be put in this box? Whatever, game's fucking not even,
[12851.66s -> 12863.30s]  it's pretty good. Get that off the screen. All right, what we got? That was Pac-Man.
[12866.12s -> 12875.72s]  That was, oh sorry, let me rephrase that. That was illegal Pac-Man.
[12875.72s -> 12893.14s]  Illegal Pac-Man is now done. Where are we going now? Are you trying to click, what are you
[12893.14s -> 12899.06s]  trying to click down there? Are you trying to trick a jail runner or strike bowling?
[12899.06s -> 12909.56s]  I'm not sure which one you're trying to click on. That looks like you're trying
[12909.56s -> 12920.46s]  to go to bowling. I'm not sure. It could be anything. Strike bowling? Let's see if it opens.
[12940.15s -> 12954.90s]  Strike bowling it is. And uh, or maybe you click it on jail. It could be anything. Strike. Call you mom,
[12954.90s -> 12965.38s]  she's crying. That's it. Blurry.
[12971.90s -> 13056.92s]  Ali, Ali, haunted Ali. Let's see this. Can you still not hear me? Screams? My game was fucking
[13056.92s -> 13080.94s]  terrible anyways. There's a creepy pasta behind that game. Well, what's left? Actually, we took a
[13080.94s -> 13102.78s]  huge trunk out. Jail? Set this as the desktop background. You want the witch as the desktop
[13102.78s -> 13111.46s]  background? That's actually, I can't, that's too bright. That's horrible. No, that's too
[13111.46s -> 13147.45s]  bright. No. Hey, remember this? No, the witch can't be the background because that's fine.
[13147.45s -> 13161.62s]  Where are we going? Hey, this is your mother. Is everything all right? Mom, everything's fine.
[13163.77s -> 13177.06s]  Jail runner? You got it. Excuse me, did I miss something? Uh, no, you didn't miss anything.
[13177.06s -> 13208.33s]  This is Mac's escape. All right, so we got, uh, volume is fine. Start. Jail runner. Jalil
[13208.33s -> 13219.90s]  runner. All right, how do I start it? Uh, Mac grew up in 1960s when love, peace, freedom
[13219.90s -> 13225.82s]  were the ideals of youth. At school, Mac was abused for everything, even for the love
[13226.46s -> 13234.34s]  to, even for love to teacher Brown's daughter. You're good for nothing. Having finished school,
[13234.34s -> 13240.78s]  Mac became an artist, but no one bought his paintings. In spite of bad luck, Mac decided to
[13240.78s -> 13245.42s]  propose to Mary Brown, the teacher's daughter, if you forgot. And what a proposal without a
[13245.42s -> 13257.05s]  ring, but here we, here were no ways to get money. One day, a man in a Mac offered Mac
[13257.85s -> 13267.32s]  money for making some copies for him, but the stranger sold the Mac's copies as the originals.
[13267.88s -> 13276.25s]  The painter was sent to jail. Mary's parents wanted her to marry another man. So Mac escaped
[13276.25s -> 13305.03s]  from jail. How do I play? All right. All right. So go now. Can I press that?
[13305.91s -> 13312.60s]  What the hell? I can't jump. Oh, I did it. Now I need a key.
[13313.48s -> 13321.94s]  Is that it? Can I get this? I got that key. I have a shovel. Ah, the shovel knocks down. I get it.
[13321.94s -> 13331.35s]  I get it. I get it. I walked over the rat as a bridge somehow. How do I get over there? I have
[13331.35s -> 13346.81s]  to fall down? How the fuck am I supposed to do this? How do I get up there? Top left. Climb on
[13346.81s -> 13356.09s]  the pipe. I thought that was part of the background. I don't think I can climb it.
[13356.09s -> 13387.11s]  Not the big pipe? Like, it's done with this pipe. All right. What is that sound?
[13390.07s -> 13426.30s]  Oh, whoa! Ah! Jail little rat. I'm just gonna go through the middle. X level, you made it.
[13426.94s -> 13430.07s]  Well, that was fun. We got, we saw pretty much everything we needed to see.
[13430.07s -> 13440.89s]  How about that play? How's that for a play? That is a warden now.
[13444.41s -> 13452.70s]  Assuming he just follows you around. Oh, fuck. Okay. Watch out. Why are there ladders in a prison?
[13452.70s -> 13464.94s]  Is that a camera? What happens if I go near it? All right. Okay. Nice work.
[13470.31s -> 13478.17s]  Wait till them to cross. And then there it is. And then I'm going to go out on that one.
[13478.17s -> 13486.30s]  Whoa! All right. That's it. I win. That was a good game. That was another guy.
[13487.02s -> 13513.88s]  What else we got? That was Jail Break. Hidden Object Mania. That's not really what you want.
[13526.84s -> 13566.65s]  Hidden Object Mania. Or Texas Hold'em. I don't know where you guys are going. Looks like we're
[13566.65s -> 13577.88s]  doing Texas Hold'em. It's got 3D in the title. I don't think it's going to work. I will give
[13577.88s -> 13588.46s]  it an attempt. Oh, it is. It's opening. This is the same one as the video. Hey! Hey!
[13588.46s -> 13605.53s]  Another reference! You ready for more references? How do I start? Random people, random all.
[13606.17s -> 13616.38s]  Starting cash. Fucking trillion dollars or 9999999. Me? All right. Whatever.
[13618.38s -> 13630.42s]  Everybody gets that money. I thought that was just me. Fold. Fold. Call. Fold. Call. Fold.
[13632.73s -> 13648.68s]  Raise. Fold. Call. Call. Fold. Call. King seven. Check. Bet. Fold. Raise. Raise. Fold.
[13650.28s -> 13660.46s]  Raise. Raise. Raise. Raise. Check that bet. Raise. Raise. I wonder what you got. Raise. Raise.
[13661.26s -> 13677.30s]  Raise. Raise. Raise. Raise. Raise. Raise. Raise. Raise. Raise. Raise. Raise. Call. Bet.
[13680.10s -> 13697.40s]  Raise. Raise. Raise. Raise. Raise. Raise. Raise. Raise. Raise. Raise. Raise. Raise. Raise.

[13726.86s -> 13729.82s]  How much money did you just win? Eight hundred and forty-seven dollars?
[13730.70s -> 13742.04s]  How can I change the bet? Fold. Ace jack. Fold. Fold. Fold. Fold. Oh no. There goes 0.9%
[13742.04s -> 13760.73s]  of your cash. Fold. Call. Call. Fold. Bet. Raise. Raise. Raise. Raise. Call. Call. Bet.
[13766.62s -> 13784.71s]  Raise. Raise. Raise. I'm gonna have 5,500 people watching this. Raise. Call. Call. Bet.
[13786.95s -> 13806.28s]  I was about to fold. Raise. All right. Come on. I got a pair of jacks. Oh well. Where?
[13808.70s -> 13816.58s]  And I'm still, I'm gonna be real honest with you guys. My mind is still struggling with that
[13816.58s -> 13832.23s]  slap. It is. It's still fighting in my brain. Like the left and right hemispheres of your brain,
[13832.23s -> 13840.41s]  the left one is streaming, the right one is going. Man, that slap. Where are we going?
[13849.78s -> 13863.10s]  Oh, you want to go to hidden object mania? You barely touched yourself, you big baby. No,
[13863.10s -> 13871.58s]  I know I didn't do it that hard, but the fact that it happened is worse than shit in my pants
[13871.58s -> 13880.63s]  on stream. All right. Hidden object mania. Let's open it. I remember this one. This is the same
[13880.63s -> 13892.20s]  one. Same shit. You have to find. Dragon attack. It's just the, it's the, which one is
[13892.20s -> 13906.58s]  the difference? It's find the differences. Start. Is it starting? Why is there another window
[13906.58s -> 13924.36s]  here? I'm so confused. Did they just take screenshots? Hidden object mania bunny play.
[13934.34s -> 13949.90s]  It's not interactive, but it wasn't at all. It was interactive. Here you guys have, you guys
[13949.90s -> 13988.33s]  play. Start. What do you think I'm doing? Click the stuff. Click the X. This is what
[13988.33s -> 13992.78s]  you get for not folding. All right. So did you guys find it? Yeah. Okay. I see the,
[13992.78s -> 13999.10s]  the red cheek here. Again, I thought it was a slap again. They're just, you got,
[13999.10s -> 14007.69s]  it's just, just trying to remind me of things. The starfish is different over here.
[14011.03s -> 14020.23s]  The pens, the eyes are different color. Good work. The pencil is in the middle. Pencil,
[14020.23s -> 14041.82s]  pencil. What about the pencil? This is flash player eight. Enter. You guys did a pretty
[14041.82s -> 14077.27s]  good job. I think you found, you found most of the things. Nice work guys. My God. So
[14077.35s -> 14086.74s]  there are, there are, there are over 1200 clips of this stream. That's like double or triple
[14086.74s -> 14116.55s]  what it normally is. All right. We're going, uh, boker drop or mystery Moscow.
[14126.60s -> 14133.00s]  He didn't play cubic frenzy. Not yet. All right. It looks like it's split between,
[14133.00s -> 14144.06s]  uh, boker drop and mystery Moscow. Let's go ahead and open it. Okay. I'm going to do all
[14144.06s -> 14149.58s]  the mystery cities in a row because they're, they're the same game. Mystery New York,
[14149.58s -> 14153.26s]  mystery Paris, mystery Moscow. They're all the same. So let's just get them over with.
[14154.57s -> 14164.47s]  Here we go. In three, two, one action. Same company, same game, same volume, same thing.
[14168.17s -> 14185.48s]  No witch this time. What's the point of the voting if it's just anarchy?
[14186.74s -> 14193.56s]  Well, I mean, the consensus usually is about 20, 30% every time. Usually toaster. No bat
[14194.52s -> 14204.52s]  tire bunny. This is Moscow, right? I don't know how an apartment building is just Moscow. It's
[14204.52s -> 14237.98s]  just a apartment. Mystery Paris. I really hope we see a witch. That would be so funny.
[14250.87s -> 14255.45s]  Here's New York. We got to get through these quickly.
[14259.53s -> 14261.69s]  I'm looking for a witch. I don't want it so bad.
[14262.57s -> 14282.58s]  Jerma witch and emote and Jerma slap. But what, how would I even make the slap and emote?
[14283.30s -> 14303.61s]  It would have to be right on contact. Well, that was fun. Those, there's a lobster there.
[14304.25s -> 14311.64s]  What are you linking here? See, everything's fine. I'm good.
[14312.44s -> 14337.19s]  Bruise? There's no bruise. Look, my face is just like that. I have like a redder face
[14337.19s -> 14344.44s]  right now because it's hot in here. Got a black eye. I don't have a black eye. I'm just tired.
[14348.58s -> 14372.58s]  Set as wallpaper. Fuck me. Fine. Which one am I going to put as the wallpaper?
[14372.58s -> 14430.44s]  Where we going? Oh, that's right. The mystery, all the mystery cities. I have,
[14430.44s -> 14447.08s]  oh, what have I done? Mystery Paris, mystery, mystery New York, mystery. What the hell is
[14447.08s -> 14467.51s]  the other one here? Mystery Moscow. And then next to that, Poker Drop. Let's give it a try.
[14467.51s -> 14517.19s]  Gamesoft. 2000 Sweet Leaf Studios. Windows NT. This is Tetris? Cards? What the fuck?
[14517.19s -> 14532.81s]  What's, what's happening right now? Oh, I can choose. Wouldn't a pair work if it was poker?
[14532.81s -> 14539.32s]  How does that make any sense? That's three. That's three of a kind.
[14539.32s -> 14559.78s]  Does it mean next to each other? Read them and weep.
[14563.96s -> 14583.58s]  Read them and weep. Well, that was fun. Special thanks. What are you, what are you clicking
[14583.58s -> 14608.25s]  on? What were you clicking? Nothing. Nice background. Thanks. I may as well own it.
[14610.60s -> 14618.25s]  Poker Drop. Tetris with poker, but I don't know. I have no idea what it was.
[14618.25s -> 14628.92s]  He lacks the knowledge of what occurred. Do I though? I looked at you making a triangle.
[14644.25s -> 14659.22s]  We got it. No. Tank Battle is currently winning. Goddamn Tank Battle. Let me see
[14659.22s -> 14664.63s]  what you're doing. Oh, let me see. This is the clip. Holy shit. This is,
[14664.87s -> 14670.44s]  a pair of work. How could you even see anything? It's like,
[14675.24s -> 14703.74s]  this is unwatchable. Oh, unwatchable. We're going to Tank Battle. Let's see if it opens.
[14709.19s -> 14719.14s]  Nope. It doesn't open. No Tank Battle for us. Might as well put the X on it.
[14719.14s -> 14738.58s]  Hey, you got any other ideas? 100%. What the fuck? What is it? The number is being,
[14738.58s -> 14752.78s]  it's covering everything. What is that? Aquarium Shop. Let's give it a go. This one opens.
[14752.78s -> 14759.35s]  That's a good sign. Just kind of is in the corner like all these other dumb games.
[14778.89s -> 14789.13s]  It was London? Well, are you sure? I feel like I'm going to like this one. This one might
[14789.13s -> 14800.39s]  give me at least 10 minutes. All right, options. Let's get the music a little bit lower because
[14800.39s -> 14807.18s]  I mean you can't even hear a damn thing. Star Game. How does it work? Same company
[14807.18s -> 14812.76s]  that made the other one probably. What's she holding? Since my parents worked as lifeguards,
[14812.76s -> 14816.84s]  I spent my childhood by the sea. I discovered the beauty hidden beneath the surface of the
[14816.84s -> 14822.04s]  ocean during my first visit to the aquarium. Enchanted. I decided to work in an aquarium
[14822.04s -> 14833.40s]  when I grew up. Sealand. Now it's time to make my dreams come true to get started. I
[14833.40s -> 14839.06s]  bought an old house by the sea. The previous owner didn't take good care of it, but I plan
[14839.06s -> 14845.10s]  on making some improvements. Is that supposed to be the house? With my help, these baby fish
[14845.10s -> 14853.83s]  will grow to be beautiful adult specimens. This is the house you bought. Hello, Jenny's
[14853.83s -> 14859.34s]  fish shop. At last, my first order. Select a pet to keep you company during the game.
[14859.34s -> 14863.02s]  Sharky will help you take care of fish and Taz will lend you a hand if time is running out.
[14866.62s -> 14881.67s]  Taz. Yeah, I agree. Big fish. Helicopter pad. Play. It's my first day. I'm going to be
[14881.67s -> 14884.63s]  receiving orders to raise fish. I should get familiar with my equipment.
[14885.19s -> 14911.53s]  Now it's another one of these. So they bring fish to my store. Why is he locked in here?
[14912.49s -> 14960.20s]  Oh, okay. All right. Get him out. Box him up. What's that money? 32 bucks sold.
[14961.16s -> 14987.99s]  No, is that right? I think I got it. What's wrong?
[14991.98s -> 15011.56s]  Hold on. I got him. He's fine. Turtle saved everybody. Let me make that money.
[15012.28s -> 15034.36s]  Is this a real game? Yeah. Taz is supposed to be in here. He's not drowning. He's a
[15034.36s -> 15047.88s]  turtle. They live in the ocean. He gives more time. I get it. Pet shop or daycare.
[15049.88s -> 15056.42s]  Yeah, they pretty much come to your place for you to feed. Can't do anything else.
[15057.38s -> 15065.86s]  Turtles can't breathe underwater. We'll blame people that made this game. I didn't make it.
[15066.58s -> 15077.50s]  I had nothing to do with this. You did? Well, then you should have known better.
[15082.60s -> 15095.02s]  $259. Three minutes of work. Pretty sick. Why did it take that long for that to pop up?
[15095.98s -> 15116.34s]  All right. Let's have a little chat. Let's see where we are right now.
[15116.34s -> 15135.61s]  We are at... where is this one? Okay. I'm not opening that one. I don't care. All right. So
[15135.61s -> 15148.34s]  we have... we're pretty much at the 50 to 60. We're at like 60 percentile. No, I'm not doing
[15148.34s -> 15160.78s]  that one. It's already covered. Mystery London is Mystery New York. See? Look, I opened it.
[15161.50s -> 15182.07s]  All right. Now what? Picks up notes. That was a nice speed run.
[15184.70s -> 15188.14s]  Did he already play Farmer Crates? Oh yeah. If it's got an X on it means we already did it.
[15196.82s -> 15205.30s]  We seem to be very split. 16% are clicking on one that has already been shown on screen.
[15211.67s -> 15224.41s]  16% want. Oh, it's close. Taxi? Yeah. Looks... no, hold on. But these are already done. Why
[15224.41s -> 15230.09s]  are you guys clicking over here? Should I even ask that question? Stone Age Taxi. There it is.
[15230.09s -> 15248.39s]  All right. Let's go. That isn't the first pack. Stone Age Taxi. No, it's not the first pack.
[15248.39s -> 15264.82s]  What fucking pack is this in? This one. We've played this one already. No. Got him. Got him.
[15272.71s -> 15305.35s]  Got that guy. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. We in trouble? Not good. Not good. Don't do it to us.
[15305.35s -> 15327.56s]  Wow. Why is it the click? I can't even... no, what is this like doing? Get off! Get...
[15327.56s -> 15345.94s]  what are you doing? It took over my whole computer again. Leaked. Yeah, I leaked out like
[15346.58s -> 15358.70s]  the menu. Oh, there's this... there's nothing there. This might... maybe you might have seen
[15358.70s -> 15404.12s]  my recycling bin. What's going on back here? I hate that I have to do this. What a crock of
[15404.12s -> 15424.92s]  shit. All right. Here we go. Played this one. Kid mode. This one. I do. You can run the
[15425.00s -> 15438.62s]  people over and shit. I remember it. What reference can I make? Oh, in kid mode you can't kill the
[15438.62s -> 15476.12s]  cavemen. You can kill them in the adult mode. You're welcome. How's this for kid mode? Nope.
[15482.76s -> 15488.86s]  Want to see the difference? Here's the difference.
[15500.46s -> 15505.61s]  There's the difference. They were really concerned about kids running people over,
[15505.61s -> 15516.95s]  apparently. Damn it. These all suck so bad. Oh, what about the kids? We have to take care
[15516.95s -> 15557.54s]  of the kids. It's down here. Hmm. Tennis champion. Penguin push. Uh, looks like we're
[15557.54s -> 15566.26s]  going to do... oh, it's kind of... I don't know. Tennis? Is this big head tennis?
[15569.26s -> 15584.14s]  Yeah, this is probably big head tennis, from what I remember. This is what you waited for,
[15584.14s -> 15589.66s]  ladies and gentlemen. That's right. Big head tennis. You guys always try to find a way to
[15589.66s -> 15605.70s]  slip in that thing. All right, let's put it on. Tennis championship. Uh, no. No, I don't know
[15605.70s -> 15634.26s]  what this means, so I'm not going to do that. I don't know. Why does it need that? Direct play.
[15634.26s -> 15648.55s]  It's safe? Skip installation. No, it's going to sit there for fucking 10 minutes and install it.
[15648.55s -> 15683.48s]  Why did I just teleport? Skip. That's just... that's not a monster. Side burns? They're
[15683.48s -> 15697.90s]  fine. They're fine. They're correct. The closet opened on its own. Oh, it did it now. Did the
[15697.90s -> 15711.82s]  closet open on its own? They're not two different lengths. It did. The closet opened on its own.
[15712.38s -> 15738.73s]  Show me a clip. They actually are uneven. Bullshit. No, they're not. That's just the way
[15738.73s -> 15745.40s]  that my face is shaped. See, there's just less hair here. I have to get my haircut. Look.
[15745.40s -> 15754.94s]  Look at the ear. Right here on the ear. Right there. Look at the ear. Right there. See?
[15754.94s -> 15777.14s]  They're even. He's so bald. How could you call this so bald? I mean, it's... I'm receding, but it's not...
[15778.02s -> 15785.48s]  Don't let him get to you. Don't let him get to you. I'll do two hands this time and go around
[15785.48s -> 15789.96s]  and hit both cheeks. I almost did it again. And here's how that happened. I figured it out.
[15790.60s -> 15794.76s]  So I'm looking at the preview right now because... well, I'm looking at the preview.
[15794.76s -> 15799.72s]  I was gauging how far... I almost did it again because I can't gauge the distance by
[15799.72s -> 15805.11s]  looking at the preview on the screen. Can you imagine if I fucking just smashed both
[15805.11s -> 15818.54s]  sides of my face right there? For the love of God. All right. Anyways, uneven bald spots.
[15819.10s -> 15829.38s]  That's fine. Who just gave bits? Who are you? The guy on the tennis championship icon is just
[15829.38s -> 15833.88s]  you when you were doing the green screen walk, but someone has edited a tennis racket into
[15833.88s -> 15868.07s]  your hand. That's fucking funny. Well, tennis doesn't work. Okay, why is it? Because
[15868.07s -> 15882.63s]  the window's 10. And I did all this shit to... whatever. Tennis walk doesn't work. Where are
[15882.63s -> 15904.58s]  we heading? Might be penguin push. Possible. That might be air strike. Maybe the doctor lab.
[15905.70s -> 15925.67s]  It's gonna be penguin push. If it's... oh, when we do jewel wizardry, I'm gonna do the line.
[15926.76s -> 15931.48s]  Oh fuck. Did I just... no, it's gonna... it's penguin push. No, it's not. What the fuck?
[15939.18s -> 15946.18s]  Well, we might as well get it out of the way. I feel like I'm doing stand up. Remember I told
[15946.18s -> 15953.38s]  you how I have a tour of the country with my... my popular video? I just get up on the stage and
[15953.38s -> 15967.16s]  I'm just like, ladies and gentlemen. Yeah, I got the mic in my hand. I'm just like,
[15967.96s -> 15975.02s]  so you know, how are you guys doing? Are you guys doing good? Yeah! Jewel wizardry!
[15975.66s -> 15999.51s]  That's what I'm doing right now. This is like the fifth or sixth town I've been to. I wonder
[15999.51s -> 16007.96s]  if I can get the whole thing correct. In fact, let's see. Let's see if I can get it. Jewel
[16009.00s -> 16031.56s]  wizardry. Give me a moment though. I need to queue this up. All right, where is it?
[16039.74s -> 16047.29s]  See? Look! Remember this part? I can't stop it. See? The same thing happened.
[16047.29s -> 16057.56s]  My computer. So, you know, when I... this is real. We're just doing the video again.
[16059.08s -> 16067.38s]  All right, where... where's jewel wizardry? Where is... there it is. See if I can get this.
[16068.50s -> 16080.31s]  Here we go. Okay, I'm gonna try. Make sure you can hear it. I haven't seen this video in a
[16080.31s -> 16115.46s]  long time. I think I know what I said though. Incoming jewel wizardry. You're gonna do it?
[16118.30s -> 16125.90s]  What the fuck are you doing? You're telling me jewel wizardry is not even gonna open.
[16125.90s -> 16133.59s]  You gotta be kidding me. I... where is it? I don't see it anywhere.
[16140.42s -> 16181.02s]  What is this? What are you linking here? What are you linking? What is this? I'm not gonna
[16181.02s -> 16192.68s]  look at that on camera. I need to make sure you guys can see this. All right, I'm just gonna
[16192.68s -> 16206.50s]  go. Here we go. Can I get it? A classic game. A game of jewel wizardry. If you think you're
[16206.50s -> 16215.30s]  powerful enough to try to challenge a road in a red dress and a Diablo 2 paladin scepter.
[16218.47s -> 16222.49s]  I... I did it kind of good. Oh, I get it. I actually get it. I get it.
[16223.21s -> 16248.66s]  That's close enough. He hasn't changed at all. Not quite. Can I like...
[16250.12s -> 16257.21s]  Hold on. God damn it. Let's try this again. I'll get the whole thing this time.
[16257.21s -> 16280.14s]  I'm gonna wait till it's ready. Okay, let's do it again. No, never mind. We're not doing
[16280.14s -> 16291.75s]  that again. Oh, it's a classic. The classic game of jewel wizardry. ASDF. Was it the same
[16291.75s -> 16320.60s]  in the video? Because that would be very, very strange. Yes, it was. What? No way. Oh,
[16320.60s -> 16327.22s]  that has to be default. Because I'm on a different computer on a different internet.
[16328.18s -> 16348.81s]  In a different state. Oh, okay. Oh, I get it. Ready? Oh, okay. Oh, I get it. Oh,
[16348.81s -> 16367.56s]  it's kind of cool. Nice. Oh, okay. Oh, I get it. Can't do that one. Oh, okay.
[16374.46s -> 16397.96s]  Point. I fucked it up. There's a bonus inside this triangle. I can't get it out.
[16400.41s -> 16439.75s]  Oh, okay. I get it. It's actually kind of fun. Nice. Quick, use the Diablo 2
[16439.75s -> 16518.33s]  Paladin Scepter. What does this do then? This actually might be the most interesting game
[16518.33s -> 16524.09s]  like this whole thing. I think I did say that. Let's just repeat the same video, the same thing.
[16525.21s -> 16538.18s]  Come on, Jeremy. Say it. Bonus. Not easy yet. Aquarium shop was the best? I think I'm out of
[16538.18s -> 16543.93s]  the disability there. I don't like the time management bullshit.
[16555.78s -> 16559.86s]  What about Jail Run? No, that game sucked, too.
[16563.43s -> 16570.36s]  Jewel Wizardry is actually pretty great. You know, for its time, I think it was kind of way
[16571.00s -> 16583.46s]  ahead of its time. See, they took the game Tetris that they didn't make. Changed it a
[16583.46s -> 16617.67s]  little bit. Got it. Come on, hurry up. Hurry up. Nice. Pretty good. Sponsored stream.
[16646.79s -> 16671.50s]  That was good. That was Jewel Wizardry. Just like the, remember the last time we did it? It
[16671.50s -> 16690.68s]  was so much fun. You're too old. That's why you like mom games. Mom games? I don't even
[16690.68s -> 16700.70s]  know what that means. Could have guessed that the next one was going to be Penguin Push.
[16706.98s -> 16726.54s]  What games does your mom play? My mom doesn't play any games. Why? Because, I don't know,
[16726.54s -> 16737.13s]  she doesn't play video games. She's not a gamer. I'm trying to think the last game. You know
[16737.13s -> 16743.90s]  what? The last game that my mother played was Grand Theft Auto 3 because we were like,
[16743.90s -> 16748.84s]  Mom, you try. And she's like, I don't know about this. This seems crazy. And then she
[16748.84s -> 16758.82s]  smashed into a wall and she got scared. So she never did it again. All right, Penguin Push.
[16809.05s -> 16832.10s]  Is direct play safe to enable? Let's see. Is direct play safe now? Is it safe now? What
[16832.10s -> 16844.90s]  do you mean now? Badgers, I don't trust this bullshit. I can't host using sockets
[16844.90s -> 16853.30s]  because I run ICS as well. You mean that disc erasing effect. I think that was fixed ages ago.
[16854.89s -> 16878.01s]  What? Why is that so scary? Is that correct? All right, this is on. Once installed, it won't
[16878.01s -> 16886.22s]  cause a VAC BAM when I play other games, right? And somebody writes, direct play is an API inside
[16886.22s -> 16898.07s]  of DirectX. It shouldn't cause any issues with other games. I'm going to fucking crash my
[16898.07s -> 16917.29s]  goddamn entire PC. Install. It's installing right now. Did it work? Oh, fuck. What
[16917.37s -> 16980.02s]  happened? Are we good? Penguin Popper. It's too much. Playing is easy. You and a friend play
[16980.02s -> 16984.58s]  penguins who have to escape the nasty Eskimos and their pets. You move through the levels by
[16984.58s -> 16989.83s]  squashing all the Eskimos and their pets. You do this by pushing blocks. There are four
[16989.83s -> 17003.24s]  different enemies to watch out for. Pushing the ice blocks. This is just, I'm at a concert
[17003.24s -> 17045.34s]  and the guy on the piano got way too into it. Oh, what happened? Let's delete it. Come on,
[17045.34s -> 17097.30s]  let's see those hands. I think I broke something. Nope, I'm not doing that. That would have been
[17097.30s -> 17114.78s]  really bad. I have shorts on. I am having another slap moment on this stream. End tutorial.
[17115.50s -> 17125.00s]  I was going to go like this with my feet like dun dun dun. No fucking way. Not right
[17125.08s -> 17147.50s]  now. What happened? 80 levels. 80 games in this one. Watch this. Watch this.
[17148.62s -> 17170.76s]  Up! Oh, I get it. It's Kenny himself. I'm trying to get the mouse off the screen.
[17178.12s -> 17224.44s]  Fuck. Wait, I can go through. I'm so glad I didn't just show like my fucking legs.
[17225.32s -> 17228.36s]  Somebody would have freeze framed and it would have been, I would have gotten
[17229.24s -> 17236.20s]  banned from Twitch forever. All it takes is one guy to like, one guy just has to freeze
[17236.20s -> 17240.04s]  frame the exact second that I like turn my legs over with shorts on and all of a sudden you're
[17240.04s -> 17255.32s]  gone. I can't have that. We live in the fucking digital age. Wait, what's this? Yeah, I know,
[17255.32s -> 17278.36s]  one guy. Diner Drop. Uh, I veto that one. It's going to be Diner Dash, but a different name.
[17284.22s -> 17302.44s]  What's this? Oh, okay. We're going to put a penis. Hey, hey, what do you think we should do?
[17302.44s -> 17306.12s]  Hey, hey, hey, chat. Hey, what do you want to do? Hey, shh, don't tell him. Hey,
[17306.12s -> 17314.86s]  don't tell him. We're going to put a penis. Hey, don't tell him. Alright, I'm turning on
[17314.86s -> 17331.98s]  Diner Drop. Wrong and it's free. Refused to say the website.com. That's not it. That's my face.
[17333.88s -> 17343.85s]  There it is. Do you really give a shit if this is not on the right spot? I don't think anybody
[17343.85s -> 17362.41s]  does. Yeah, come on. This is a, you're running a stream here. Well, what? Simple moves. Get three
[17362.41s -> 17366.33s]  or more identical food items in a row and they will disappear. You may swap adjacent elements
[17366.33s -> 17369.37s]  if you swap the elements, but the elements don't appear. They will return back to their
[17369.37s -> 17375.21s]  original place in less surprise. The objective of this game is to clear the entire field of time.
[17376.01s -> 17378.89s]  If you gather four or five identical food items, then you'll be ready with money. Okay,
[17378.89s -> 17384.41s]  he doubled up. That's so much information that I don't, who's going to read this?
[17384.41s -> 17403.66s]  That's so much. It's still going. It's a lot of tutorials here. Cool. It's one of these
[17403.66s -> 17411.45s]  games. So we've got cheese danishes, cheese hot dogs, three ice cream cones. These look,
[17412.09s -> 17418.41s]  it's rotten. That's a rotten bun. There's no such thing as a sesame seed hot dog bun.
[17418.41s -> 17424.12s]  Is there? I don't think there is. Is there a sesame seed hot dog bun?
[17431.70s -> 17435.37s]  There is? I've never seen it in my 38 years of life.
[17454.66s -> 17461.38s]  I'll tell you guys the story of how I spent probably 37 or 38 dollars of my life
[17461.38s -> 17480.68s]  on one of these games. I played one of these and I spent like 38 bucks. I played it for like
[17480.68s -> 17491.32s]  a year. I forget what it's called. It was like mystery gem drop or something and it was this
[17491.32s -> 17496.44s]  fake stupid where you solve mysteries but you don't just a match three game and I
[17496.44s -> 17499.69s]  don't know why I did it. There's no reason to.
[17503.85s -> 17514.28s]  No, it wasn't bejeweled. No, it wasn't. It wasn't. It was not that.
[17524.04s -> 17533.64s]  Got it. Only one more tile to clear. Order and pick up text is outside the box.
[17539.99s -> 17543.19s]  You just don't care at that point. You don't care.
[17544.15s -> 17554.49s]  How could you care? It's just that's just so
[17556.33s -> 17559.37s]  you just don't you don't even mind that that's there.
[17563.02s -> 17586.65s]  Come on. Come on. Oh wow. Why would I play that game? In fact, why am I playing this one?
[17591.83s -> 17612.65s]  That was that was uh commander crunch. Diner drop. Airstrike. I guarantee this one doesn't work.
[17612.65s -> 17631.96s]  I'm gonna I mean it's pretty unanimous right now. I 100% guarantee. I'll try it. I have 699,000
[17631.96s -> 17640.78s]  games left to play. I gotta pick up the pace. Well what needs to happen is I gotta pick up
[17640.78s -> 17649.00s]  the pace. You're right. I'm gonna just close it for now just in case it flashes on the screen.
[17650.95s -> 17671.37s]  No. I'm ready. How to play. The year 19XX. So fill in the blank there.
[17672.74s -> 17676.66s]  Third Reich has cloned thousands of zombie pilots in secret labs to support the plan
[17676.66s -> 17686.28s]  of conquering the world. To bring the world down and to stop the Nazi and the figure and
[17686.28s -> 17691.48s]  to just build an allied commander has called up three pilots in order to destroy the anime
[17691.48s -> 17704.41s]  at any cost. Skyfire. Ray, Annie, or Wolf. I won't speed. How do you play? Not like that.
[17705.05s -> 17726.09s]  It's just it's just Raiden. I'm sorry Raiden 2. Raiden 2. Yeah it's a shmup. Not really
[17726.09s -> 17733.80s]  because it's running at about 22 frames a second. It's hard to have a shmup
[17733.80s -> 17752.86s]  when the game runs like this. This shit in serial anymore. Is there a reason they stop doing that?
[17754.22s -> 17761.58s]  Just contact this company. Fucking Frosted Flakes. And replace this with Tony the Tiger.
[17767.03s -> 17769.43s]  How easy that would be and how cool everyone would think that was.
[17770.47s -> 17791.21s]  How about that be like Snap, Crackle, Pup. There are 25 enemies left. I can get them.
[17792.17s -> 17806.02s]  Let's play well. Tony the Tiger against the Nazis.
[17810.50s -> 17815.40s]  Yeah. Are you telling me you don't think that that would be worth playing?
[17830.71s -> 17842.38s]  It would definitely be. Yeah that's what I'm saying. All right I win. What do I get level?
[17842.38s -> 17848.36s]  How did I get to level three? This isn't worth playing. But it is worth playing if it was
[17848.36s -> 17862.70s]  for free in a cereal box. This can't be worth more money to make than the same Hot Wheels car
[17862.70s -> 17869.59s]  every year. You know how much it was probably to license Frozen from Disney to put in the
[17869.59s -> 17878.28s]  fucking Happy Meals? If they had just, well I was going to say put Elsa in here. But now
[17878.28s -> 17882.92s]  they didn't need Disney licensing. Forget about the licensing. Just put a piece of cereal here.
[17883.72s -> 17890.98s]  You don't have to have a licensed character. If it's cornflakes put the fucking rooster on here.
[17890.98s -> 17897.48s]  Who cares? You don't need a licensed Disney character. Put Ronald McDonald on here.
[17898.12s -> 17907.93s]  Cornflakes are disgusting. Let me just talk about that real quick.
[17913.77s -> 17921.99s]  You know I would rather slap myself in the face than eat cornflakes. They're good. How
[17921.99s -> 17929.46s]  could you say something like that? They're not. They just, they smell. Have you ever
[17929.46s -> 17932.82s]  smelled cornflakes? Pour some milk on a bowl of cornflakes and smell it.
[17933.86s -> 17937.06s]  I guarantee you you're gonna go. That's kind of, that's disgusting. What the hell am I eating?
[17947.19s -> 17950.15s]  So you'd rather shit yourself than cornflakes. That's not what I said.
[17951.27s -> 17966.62s]  Yeah it smells like sour. Like kind of like cheese. Like rotten cheese. Every time I put
[17966.62s -> 17995.82s]  milk on it. I don't know what it is. Something weird. Where we going? Oops. Sorry. Spoiled milk
[17995.82s -> 18007.38s]  joke minus 20. Yeah. Yeah I could see that. All right. Doctor lab or tomb raider? Tomb
[18007.38s -> 18022.87s]  momer. I think we're going to the doctor lab. Don't tell him we're making penis.
[18028.66s -> 18032.10s]  Somebody just leaned in really close. Clicked on the penis button. Went
[18035.29s -> 18039.16s]  right into this screen. All right. Doctor's lab. Let's go.
[18045.67s -> 18062.33s]  Doctor's lab. This is going to be Doctor Mario. Yeah it's Doctor. Even the, that's a total.
[18063.13s -> 18077.40s]  How does Nintendo get away with that? That's very clearly the guy from Doctor Mario. Use
[18077.40s -> 18088.02s]  system memory. Funny story. I don't even know how to play Doctor Mario. I have no idea.
[18094.66s -> 18104.44s]  Doctor Smith. My laboratory got attacked by malicious viruses. I have no idea how to do
[18104.44s -> 18112.34s]  this. Does it sound like we connect the two? We have to connect red to red right? Like jump
[18112.34s -> 18123.83s]  in a car. Dude this is just Doctor Mario. This is Doctor Mario. That's just Mario when he's
[18123.83s -> 18130.26s]  60. 70. Mario is supposed to be like 70 isn't he? Fuck. It's hard to control.
[18130.26s -> 18181.05s]  You gotta give them credit though. They just don't give a shit if they get sued.
[18182.07s -> 18190.89s]  Why would it ever happen? Do you think it would ever happen? I'm not sure it would.
[18194.76s -> 18215.58s]  Oh just put whatever song you. I can't. I'm trying. It's hard to control. Up is the only
[18215.58s -> 18225.08s]  thing that changes it. That's going to be something. There it is. Oh it's so hard. You
[18225.08s -> 18235.80s]  don't understand. It's like this input lag trying to move these. Trust me. Oh my god.
[18235.80s -> 18258.36s]  I pressed it twice. Oh I feel like I'm playing this underwater. Come on queue it up.
[18260.90s -> 18294.39s]  Oh my god it's. There was like a half. There was at least a half second delay when I pressed a
[18294.39s -> 18312.36s]  button. At least. Had to have been. Uh Pharaoh's Challenge. No. People have decided to change
[18312.36s -> 18321.16s]  their minds. The band's gonna sue me. They're not gonna sue me. They're gonna sue.
[18321.96s -> 18332.60s]  I don't even know what company this is. When will we play the 700,000th game?
[18333.32s -> 18344.23s]  Stop. Don't. Stop linking this flap. It reminds me every time and it brings me back there.
[18346.71s -> 18353.11s]  That's the. That's. That's. You know what that is? That's 2019 Snort. That's definitely
[18353.11s -> 18363.94s]  what that is and it's way worse. I am going to click on clips for the next year. It's
[18363.94s -> 18367.14s]  gonna be like hey dude I saw this uh funny clip that you should check out. It's gonna
[18367.14s -> 18378.38s]  be this lap. Just. Just replace it. Snort. Replace it. All right we're going to
[18378.46s -> 18391.27s]  Atom Bomber. Atom Bomber. Thank you for voting. I really appreciate it. Atom Bomber doesn't work.
[18391.27s -> 18411.93s]  Thank you for voting. Appreciate it. It's a good attempt. Sorry guys. Where you want to go now?
[18411.93s -> 18421.54s]  Pharaoh's Challenge. That's what it looks like. Book of Thanos. Don't eat fish. It's toxic.
[18426.95s -> 18435.37s]  What are you talking about? That just. Somebody just bursted through the door and just
[18435.37s -> 18462.65s]  screamed. Don't eat it. Uh Book of Thanos has one. Let's head there. Book Tales. Okay.
[18465.02s -> 18473.43s]  Fun day today. Does it open? Nope. Sorry it doesn't open. Yes it does. Yes it does.
[18474.46s -> 18484.66s]  Don't be so quick to say it doesn't. Bingo. It does. And you can't see shit. All right does
[18484.66s -> 18491.03s]  it. You need to be able to see this shit. It says please press me. Enter your name.
[18499.35s -> 18504.70s]  There it is. Turn off full screen. Figure out what the fuck this means.
[18505.42s -> 18514.97s]  Give me a second. Uh I need to show you the options here because what the fuck does that
[18514.97s -> 18529.16s]  mean? There's an option here as you'll see in just a moment. Uh so options. Eye candies.
[18529.88s -> 18548.92s]  More eye candies. I guess I'm going to keep them on fairy tale. Modest creators. That's

[18913.64s -> 18921.30s]  question. How do you vote? Just click the screen. As long as you have the extension enabled.
[18921.30s -> 18925.22s]  It should be enabled by default right? Unless you have to press a button. You might have to
[18925.22s -> 18936.04s]  enable the extension. Everybody says play bookworm adventures. Well I already I just did.
[18936.04s -> 18948.73s]  All right. Pharaoh's Challenge. Touch my monitor. Why? Pharaoh's Challenge.
[18953.98s -> 18967.42s]  Now where? Pharaoh's Challenge. We want tennis. I can't get it to work. Tennis Championship

[19075.11s -> 19084.39s]  All going this way. Oh my god. I'm gonna fucking scream here. This is gonna be insane. It's gonna
[19084.39s -> 19123.06s]  be insane. Pharaoh's Challenge. And let's try tennis one more time because I have direct play
[19123.06s -> 19129.43s]  now. Touch the monitor. What what are you talking about? What are you talking about?
[19130.23s -> 19154.22s]  What are you guys even talking about? I can't. It's gonna. It's another one of these stupid
[19154.22s -> 19162.92s]  things. I'm stuck here. All right. Let's go to career. I need. Can you guys see it?
[19163.48s -> 19185.03s]  I have to make it larger. Somewhere on earth is it go. Why are you going up there?
[19185.91s -> 19198.14s]  Why would it go up there? Let's see if I bring it down. What it does this time.
[19199.50s -> 19206.04s]  This is Hotline Miami 2 music. Oh that's as good. That's as good as it's gonna get.
[19210.50s -> 19218.78s]  Timmy. Male be human. You can be what other species? Gonna be like a dog?
[19220.22s -> 19246.12s]  Why would they be something else besides humans? I don't know how to play. Shift.
[19246.12s -> 19264.41s]  Alt. Control. Z. X. A. C. B. Space. Space. Cursor up. No. What the fuck is going on?
[19269.74s -> 19326.42s]  Oh no. Up. I have to make it random shit. I'm fucking so mad. I don't know what it is about
[19326.42s -> 19333.99s]  tennis. Tennis just fucking enrages me. It makes me so angry. I don't know what it is about
[19333.99s -> 19367.58s]  it. Got it. Look at how long that hair is. I didn't hit that. Oh my god. Fucking tennis.
[19368.06s -> 19400.66s]  Oops. Say the line. Oh I can't do it until I serve. Who coughed? How come she doesn't even need
[19400.66s -> 19405.58s]  to move? This is not fair. Everything I do goes right in the middle. She doesn't have to move.
[19406.14s -> 19418.36s]  I have to move. I keep hitting it to her. How am I supposed to not hit it?
[19419.80s -> 19425.50s]  I'm hitting it straight in the middle. All right listen.
[19427.10s -> 19432.38s]  There is no way that I'm going to be told I'm doing something wrong in a serial box tennis
[19432.38s -> 19447.29s]  game. And here we go. Big. And here we go. Big head tennis. This is what you came for.
[19447.29s -> 19457.82s]  It's not going to work. Big head tennis. This is what you came for ladies and gentlemen.
[19457.82s -> 19471.67s]  Big head tennis. See. I did it. I did the line. You cannot stop booing me. There's only space.
[19478.76s -> 19504.09s]  I can't aim where this even serves to. It just goes right to her. You're so bad.
[19505.05s -> 19517.08s]  You can't. You can't. You can't be bad at tennis championship on 700,000 games.
[19517.88s -> 19524.04s]  It's not possible. There's one action. There's swing and there's walk through mud.
[19525.56s -> 19530.92s]  There's no such thing as being bad at a game like I just splashed liquid on my face.
[19532.78s -> 19539.70s]  You suck at tennis. I'll see me in real tennis. I just fucking kick back
[19540.42s -> 19546.38s]  and smash it as hard as I can. It just goes soaring over everybody.
[19546.38s -> 19550.06s]  You know they properly throw it and it's just fucking I just hit it as hard as I can
[19550.06s -> 19556.52s]  trying to hit it like out of the ballpark. You're gonna be like everybody fucking gasps.
[19557.24s -> 19581.98s]  Touch your screen please. Oh my god. Why did I do that? I get it. Come on do it for me.
[19582.62s -> 19589.72s]  I know you guys are capable of doing this. So are you are you capable of this?
[19590.36s -> 19615.42s]  You guys are not even capable. Really? You're supposed to be touching when I touch so it looks
[19615.42s -> 19647.80s]  cool. I'll give you one more chance. I'm done with it. I'm done with it. This is too much
[19647.80s -> 19656.73s]  of a delay. It's like a four second delay. There was a 55% click on my mouth so you can't
[19656.73s -> 19661.42s]  come on. You can't tell me that I'm bad at tennis when it came from this game.
[19674.28s -> 19682.34s]  We're going to space something. Space crusaders. How long is this stream? This is almost five and
[19682.34s -> 19692.95s]  a half hours. Oh my god. At least we can say we did this. I've been watching all night for this.
[19692.95s -> 19699.45s]  Well I hope it turns on because it might not even work. I hope it works too for your sake.
[19699.45s -> 19758.33s]  I really do. I'm so sorry. What's even left? One two three four five six seven eight nine
[19759.16s -> 19762.92s]  ten eleven twelve. We've got about 30% left. Twenty five. Maybe like another hour or so.
[19776.71s -> 19785.78s]  So it looks as a foosball champ. There's 3D in this one running in compatibility mode.
[19785.78s -> 19791.77s]  The whole thing is set for compatibility mode for Windows 7. That's what is recommended.
[19794.65s -> 19804.04s]  The whole thing is in compatibility mode already and as administrator. All right.
[19804.04s -> 19812.36s]  Foosball 3D. 3D in the title and there is 3D in the title therefore
[19814.23s -> 19847.13s]  Foosball Champion does not open. Wait a goddamn second. Wait a second. I need to find out this
[19847.13s -> 19864.18s]  once and for all. Hold on. So this is this is game pack volume five and six. Five and six.
[19865.06s -> 19875.69s]  And that game was called Foosball Champion 3D. It's in here. So what the hell? I thought
[19875.69s -> 19885.24s]  it was gonna be an empty folder. Dest was making sure it was an empty door. The door is yeah the
[19885.24s -> 19901.62s]  door is moving. No it's not an empty folder. It just doesn't work. Let's not try again. Foosball
[19901.62s -> 19920.63s]  3D. Little Herder will work. The closet. What the fuck? I don't even know what the fuck you
[19920.63s -> 19940.49s]  guys are talking about. It's close. This is actually really close. We'll have to see. 24.
[19940.49s -> 19998.36s]  Wow that's this close. I can't stop it yet. Damn. 31 to 35. Little Herder. All right looks
[19998.36s -> 20018.34s]  like Bob. Bob is the winner. Let's take a look. Thanks for voting everybody. Which one was it?
[20018.34s -> 20036.65s]  Heli Quick Bob. Heli Quick Bob. Let's see. Open. Does it work? We're getting so unlucky
[20036.65s -> 20059.69s]  in a row. It doesn't work. Helicopter Bob doesn't work. How? Why? Look at how cool this
[20059.69s -> 20069.08s]  one looks too. Look it starts to open and then it just damn it. Hold on. Let me go.
[20074.74s -> 20081.16s]  We're getting kind of. We're striking out here. Seriously. Let me try a couple things
[20081.16s -> 20093.18s]  here because I want to see these. A load of bullshit. Volume 8. What was it called?
[20093.82s -> 20110.31s]  Bob? Something with a bob? Heli Quick Bob. Yeah it's in here. Let's try it running it
[20110.31s -> 20124.90s]  directly from in here. Yeah run it. Is it going to work? Sorry guys. I'm running as
[20124.90s -> 20133.40s]  administrator compatibility mode. It just isn't going to work. That's unfortunate.
[20133.96s -> 20141.38s]  Let me get that back on the screen. Try again. We're eliminating a lot of these.
[20143.22s -> 20159.10s]  Where the hell is it? 8 right? It's down here. Heli Quick Bob is dead. Take a guess again.
[20170.73s -> 20185.27s]  Where are you going here? Down lower left. Seems like it. So 4 up. It's just going to be
[20185.27s -> 20196.23s]  Connect 4. You want to play Connect 4? We can play Connect 4. If it opens. And it is. It
[20196.23s -> 20213.24s]  finally fucking opened. 4 up. This one can be changed because that looks fine. Let me zoom
[20213.24s -> 20220.70s]  in a little bit. You haven't played? This won't take very long. Alright let's go. So game.
[20222.02s -> 20235.93s]  New game. Or game settings. View. No. New game. Human versus human. Alright I'll go first.
[20236.73s -> 20268.95s]  Your turn. I think I'm going here. Uh maybe not. 34. Oh it took it over right now. That's
[20268.95s -> 20295.48s]  it. That's it? No? What the fuck? Hold on. Hold on. The vote got skewed. Try it again. Go.
[20295.48s -> 20307.27s]  Enhance. Enhance. Alright hold on let me enhance. Yeah that's enhanced. Let's do it again. Enhanced.
[20314.79s -> 20327.77s]  Come on. My grandmother's faster than you guys. My grandmother's even faster than you. Uh that
[20327.77s -> 20341.50s]  didn't help. That made it worse somehow. Did that? What are you trying to click on over here?
[20342.39s -> 20349.30s]  I need to enhance it more. Well that's where you guys are trying to go I think. Now where?
[20349.30s -> 20378.04s]  Okay. 47% down here. You got it? Alright I think I'm gonna go here. What about you guys?
[20378.04s -> 20400.55s]  Where are you going now? Okay. Right here. Sounds good. Well um sorry I'm gonna have to
[20400.55s -> 20413.11s]  block you there. So you thought I was gonna let you just do that in a row. Right there.
[20415.37s -> 20443.46s]  You got it. Okay. My turn? Where are you guys going? Okay. Here? Here? This one here? 33%?
[20443.46s -> 20460.76s]  Got it. I mean it's a majority. Almost. 35. I'm gonna go over here. Okay. Alright. That works.
[20460.76s -> 20475.22s]  That works for me. Alright. Where are you guys going? Here or here? Which one? Here?
[20475.22s -> 20484.09s]  Or down here? This one? 11%? That's a little bit. That's a lot. Here or down here?
[20484.73s -> 20497.18s]  Well maybe like over here? Some people look like enough here. Okay. Fine. Oh where do I go from
[20497.18s -> 20502.78s]  here? Oh hmm hmm hmm. Right here. Looks good to me. Where are you guys going? Down here?
[20505.32s -> 20517.94s]  Over this way I think. Maybe like down this way or this way. I've never seen
[20519.24s -> 20542.14s]  a consensus like this and it broke. I just had to say it. You guys might have a good play
[20542.22s -> 20549.86s]  down here if you get a couple down here. Because like I'm going diagonal here so you
[20549.86s -> 20563.26s]  can get a block right here. Hmm. Let me see where I'm at here.
[20565.42s -> 20592.01s]  Right into my twap. Where are you guys going? Right here? Oh that's a good play.
[20597.11s -> 20624.90s]  Like oh I get this. I get it. Where you off to? We chat is in trouble. I've got three
[20624.90s -> 20631.08s]  separated plays that nobody knows about except for me. And now it seems like you're
[20631.08s -> 20634.68s]  splendoring a little here. You don't know. Should we go up here? Down here?
[20636.04s -> 20639.56s]  Jebaited! Right? Oh no. The one where he holds his head. Feels like this.
[20639.56s -> 20653.72s]  Feels failfish. Feels bad. No. Not like this. Okay. Really not like to be in the
[20653.72s -> 20660.60s]  position that you guys are in now. No I would not. Because now you have to. You have to
[20660.60s -> 20667.18s]  start to worry about the win that I have here. Now you have to worry about it. And I've got
[20667.18s -> 20690.17s]  three victories. You sure? Three lined up victories. Oh boy is this gonna be bad.
[20692.73s -> 20722.22s]  Seriously. I mean the look on your face. The look on all of our 4500 faces.
[20726.26s -> 20735.91s]  Ah look at how spread out it is over here. Look at all these places I can go.
[20736.63s -> 20740.84s]  I've got so many. Just depends on which one I'd like to go to.
[20748.02s -> 20764.10s]  This way? This way? Right in the middle here. Oof. Oof. Oof. That's an oof. Okay.
[20773.90s -> 20784.41s]  Well. Well. Look at that. You would just love to have that wouldn't you?
[20784.41s -> 20787.77s]  You'd just love to have one of these. One of those. Right here.
[20790.58s -> 20794.06s]  Yeah. You would. You would like that I think.
[20794.62s -> 20821.10s]  I don't know.
[20824.55s -> 20844.14s]  I love this. 17 percent. Traitors. Traitor.
[20852.82s -> 20886.68s]  Okay. This is. This is. There's a decent play over here for you guys if you can come up.
[20904.97s -> 20913.21s]  All right. I wonder. I wonder what I'm gonna do.
[20914.63s -> 20957.62s]  83 percent. Mercy kill. Mercy kill. That's not four in a row guys.
[20957.62s -> 20995.42s]  Do you surrender? No surrender? Never. Okay. Never surrender. All right fine. You sure?
[20995.42s -> 21019.21s]  I mean I could if you wanted to. Eddie you want to go here? Oh boy.
[21019.21s -> 21024.23s]  That's actually a pretty smart play. You should do it. Please go there.
[21024.23s -> 21027.54s]  Absolutely click that. Do not change your mind. Click right there.
[21034.57s -> 21095.08s]  I'm trying to help a little bit. Four up. What are you gonna do? Okay.
[21095.08s -> 21114.17s]  That's it. Congratulations chat. You lost.
[21114.17s -> 21128.44s]  I would play the rest of this out but is it even really worth it? Should I?
[21129.32s -> 21200.12s]  Okay. That was fun to play together.
[21200.12s -> 21222.74s]  This is a draw. Rematch? Okay fine. One rematch and that's it. I'll go first.
[21224.76s -> 21232.10s]  Say how would you save changes to that? Go for it. No. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Stop.
[21232.10s -> 21266.34s]  Okay. In the middle. 62 percent. 49. 40 percent. 49 percent. Okay.
[21277.30s -> 21280.98s]  Is chat getting too caught up drawing a dick on the screen that I'm just gonna win in four
[21280.98s -> 21334.86s]  moves? You can't just click no mercy. Okay. Good luck. Are you gonna draw your dick to
[21334.86s -> 21373.64s]  victory? Is that what this is? That's not even I don't think that's possible. Right here. 47.
[21373.64s -> 21381.62s]  What do you say? Okay. Yeah that works for me. No that's good. Good call.
[21393.02s -> 21397.58s]  No that's not rigged. That's not rigged. I would I was in the middle of saying that's good for me
[21397.58s -> 21406.18s]  and all of a sudden everybody changes their votes. It was 44 to 39 and I was like all right and
[21406.18s -> 21416.78s]  then it was like wait no hold on and everybody clicked on over here. Didn't wait long enough.
[21416.78s -> 21433.02s]  I waited plenty. That was as long as I waited the last 10 turns. That what? Pull it back.
[21433.02s -> 21446.50s]  Let's run it back. Let's see it. Well yeah but you just wanted to win. No it's not the
[21446.50s -> 21453.24s]  case. But let's pick another game because we got to move through this shit. That one isn't
[21453.24s -> 21457.88s]  canon okay. We'll count the first one as canon. We tied. It was a tie game between the two of us.
[21458.90s -> 21472.17s]  Between the one and 4500 of us. What the hell was that game called? Checkers? Connect 4?
[21472.17s -> 21482.44s]  I have no idea what the hell that was. Four up. Right over here right? Right there.
[21482.44s -> 21483.24s]  All right where we going?
[21493.03s -> 21496.39s]  Everyone's linking. Oh why is everyone spam linking this?
[21506.04s -> 21512.20s]  Oh it's the god. It makes it so bad because we need to watch this because this is very
[21512.20s -> 21520.65s]  important. The the slap in the game makes this fucking so brutal. Do you understand?
[21523.06s -> 21536.46s]  The slap in the in the game. I timed it perfectly. Why am I linking this? You've already seen it.
[21539.13s -> 21546.28s]  That that is. Oh my. Yeah it was real. I accidentally did it but this game sound
[21547.32s -> 21556.09s]  made that so much worse. That wasn't as loud as that actually was. That looks like I fucking
[21556.09s -> 21571.90s]  crushed myself. All right where we going? Did it hurt? No because I didn't. I'm not playing.
[21572.54s -> 21597.66s]  Connect up again. I'm not. No. Let's. Okay the clip of me cheating. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
[21597.66s -> 21601.10s]  I want to get this on stream so we can have a documented evidence of what happened.
[21602.76s -> 21625.93s]  Documented proof. One second. We can watch this right now. Look at that. 40. Do you see?
[21625.93s -> 21639.21s]  44. Right when I click it. Look take take a look again. Slow it down. Look at this. 43 to 39.
[21640.01s -> 21651.72s]  You can hear the click. Listen for it. See? I clicked it right here. Right there. Listen.
[21651.72s -> 21666.34s]  Are you listening? See? You guys didn't make up your mind fast enough. There wasn't there was
[21666.34s -> 21684.26s]  not a consensus. Bang. You can't call me out on that one. You weren't quick enough.
[21685.06s -> 21704.01s]  44, 42, 44, 39. Bang. There it is. I mean what more can I say? That's how the cards fell.
[21735.53s -> 21745.69s]  So many games left. And we're getting late too. It's been six hours. All right. If even one
[21745.69s -> 21759.74s]  percent click on something else. I'm gonna count it. You understand? That's unbelievable.
[21760.38s -> 21765.82s]  I'm gonna let. Okay I'm gonna grab uh I'm gonna grab another soda. I'm. Someone's gonna
[21765.82s -> 21776.50s]  click. I know they will. See? See? See? I told you. See? We got like blaster balls in space. We've
[21776.50s -> 21787.72s]  got fun maze traitors. I mean you got a significant portion of traitors it seems.
[21793.03s -> 21796.55s]  All right. I really am gonna grab another drink. I'll be right back. Probably the last
[21796.55s -> 21802.90s]  break of the night. And we will clock out the rest of these. Probably another another couple
[21802.90s -> 21807.22s]  hours maybe. Maybe like an hour hour or two. Who knows? We're just gonna go. I'm having
[21807.22s -> 21820.49s]  fun. You having fun? You having a good time? Okay. Yeah. Yeah. No. Because you cheated. No.
[21820.49s -> 21835.59s]  You cheater. I'll be right back. I'm not. You think I'm gonna leave without turning that off?
[21836.15s -> 22024.23s]  This is the chat that cried wolf. I'll be right back. So I just tried to explain to
[22024.23s -> 22028.22s]  the people downstairs that I hit myself. That I slapped myself in the face.
[22029.86s -> 22033.46s]  And I just got. They couldn't even understand how it was possible.
[22034.26s -> 22042.74s]  Ah. Was I on purpose? No, no, no. Were you drinking? No, I wasn't drinking.
[22044.70s -> 22057.90s]  It ain't AC being green. As Kermit the fucking frog once said. All right. Uh so what have we
[22057.90s -> 22112.90s]  decided to do? Chat. What are we doing? Well. You guys just made like a squished dick.
[22113.94s -> 22131.62s]  Why am I talking? Stop talking. This never would have happened if we didn't have to come
[22131.62s -> 22142.20s]  back into this game. I'll take that vote kick. Kick me. Get me out of here. I'm gonna give a lot
[22142.20s -> 22163.10s]  of time for you guys. More than 10 seconds. It was like 25 seconds. You can't tell me that
[22163.10s -> 22181.85s]  it wasn't. Where are you off to? I'm gonna hold on for like 10. I'm gonna do 10 seconds.
[22189.19s -> 22214.97s]  Okay. That's pretty. That's unanimous. Do a bad impression and the vote kicks increase.
[22214.97s -> 22220.34s]  Look at how torn this chat is now. You can't blame it on time this time guys.
[22221.86s -> 22263.70s]  You gotta blame it on the from the 20th. Blame falls here because eeeeek. Okay. Have a nice day.
[22263.70s -> 22299.59s]  Trying to build up right. I can see right through you. That's unanimous. I've had to sneeze
[22299.59s -> 22319.42s]  for six hours and it just won't fucking happen. This is horrible. Slap yourself. Why? Why does
[22319.42s -> 22332.15s]  this have to be happening? GG idiot. What do you mean GG idiot? You haven't won yet.
[22332.15s -> 22360.17s]  GG. GG idiot. You haven't won. The game still goes. Okay. Uh. Hmm. Can't go this way.
[22360.73s -> 22373.80s]  Can't really go that way. So I guess I'm gonna go this way. You're fucked now. Yellow well.
[22382.95s -> 22394.79s]  Go for the bottom. Go for the top. Go for it. Connect four. All the way over here. Seems
[22394.79s -> 22428.38s]  like that's what's gonna happen. Good luck with that. Good luck. 100%
[22448.65s -> 22463.32s]  GG idiot. GG idiot. Right here. Which which one? I want to get this right so I don't have to
[22463.32s -> 22493.34s]  fucking play connect four again. This looks like it's going over here. Do a recount? What
[22493.34s -> 22500.98s]  do you mean a recount? I don't get a recount. Let's refresh it. Fine. You get you get you
[22500.98s -> 22510.55s]  one phone a friend here. What are you guys doing? Why is it so? What is the consensus
[22510.55s -> 22535.40s]  here? Do I have to zoom in? I think this is 40 40. This is 41%. 41%. I don't know what this is.
[22538.07s -> 22547.21s]  That it's it's right here. No it's definitely this one. This is it's probably like 40
[22547.21s -> 22555.90s]  something 30 something here. All right. Last recount here. If you want it in this slot
[22555.90s -> 22561.35s]  click over here. If you want it in this slot click over here. You understand? Action.
[22566.17s -> 22576.22s]  What is going on? All right. Okay. Hold on. Wait a minute. What? This is correct. This is correct.
[22576.22s -> 22603.45s]  What's going on in the middle? It's definitely left. That's 40%. It's the left one. GG idiot.
[22604.01s -> 22701.70s]  Shit. I'm a dog sleeping. 100. Whoa. Stop stop stop. What? I can't believe there's 100
[22701.70s -> 22747.03s]  going this way. 100. Cut that one off while we can. We have all the winning moves. Idiot.
[22747.03s -> 22834.95s]  Yeah. Oh, what's that? Look at me. All right. I'm going to wait here. I'm going to give you the
[22834.95s -> 22855.40s]  time to figure it out. I am going to put my hands up. That's 10 seconds. That's it. I
[22855.40s -> 22871.48s]  can't let you guys think about it that much. That's it. That's 10%. What are you going to
[22871.48s -> 22909.21s]  do now? You want to go here? Wow. Are you sure? I can't believe you guys want to go there.
[22911.45s -> 22961.16s]  Are you done? Are you done now? Can we move on? No. Why would I do that? Again,
[22961.16s -> 22971.30s]  we already did it. I'm going to pick one at random. Play the Vincent Price laugh for us.
[22971.30s -> 22982.42s]  No. Will you pick something? We've been here for six and a half hours, guys.
[22983.80s -> 22991.56s]  Pick something else. There's not much more. There's only like 15 more video games to try.
[22997.77s -> 23007.32s]  I'm going to do it again. No, I want to win. Well, that's too bad. We're going to play
[23007.32s -> 23013.35s]  the cat in the maze. Good choice. See, there you go. You guys get to have your win.
[23014.22s -> 23018.30s]  I beat you last time. I beat, first of all, beat you guys. The first time we played
[23018.30s -> 23023.70s]  checkers beat you guys in chess, checkmated you guys in about three seconds.
[23026.68s -> 23032.36s]  We're tied right now. Checkers rematch. No, no, no. Why would I do that? You win,
[23032.36s -> 23040.55s]  you go out. All right. So we're going to do a cat maze. What the hell was this thing
[23040.55s -> 23054.01s]  called? Aqua boat maze. Chess rematch or riot. Aqua boat maze does not work. Oh, yes.
[23059.51s -> 23070.50s]  Oh, whoops. Actually, that's kind of good because I can do this. How's the hair?
[23070.50s -> 23096.12s]  Not bad. Aqua boat maze from Parker Brothers. Press any key. Where's any key, March?
[23096.76s -> 23145.16s]  I don't know. A lot of information. Anchor slows monster down. Extra life gives you
[23145.16s -> 23150.07s]  temporary invulnerability. You can eat monsters with the ring, Louis. Collect the dots.
[23150.07s -> 23161.24s]  This is just Pac-Man. Yes, it is. And there's a Lego guy here. Oh, you guys want me to play
[23161.24s -> 23176.34s]  Lego Island? Well, this is kind of it, isn't it? There's no island. I mean, there technically
[23176.34s -> 23198.42s]  is an island. It's me. And objects surrounded by a body of water is an island. We thought
[23198.42s -> 23222.01s]  I was going to lose. God, Legos are so much fun. GG, idiot squids. I got to beat the first
[23222.01s -> 23228.34s]  level. What's this one? This one does something to monsters. Slows them down. Well, good. I'll
[23228.34s -> 23235.85s]  eat them both. Get it. Nice. This game is terrible, but I'm going to complete the first
[23235.85s -> 23249.90s]  level. It's just Pac-Man again. Yeah, that's unfortunate. I ate his bones and he died.
[23252.23s -> 23264.36s]  Odd. Two, three, four. Done. Press any key. That's one. That one's done. No one wants
[23264.36s -> 23267.72s]  to me to sit there and play that for like another five minutes. I don't think one person
[23267.72s -> 23300.57s]  does. One person. You're right. There is always one guy. That's true. Well, the 35% on Connect
[23300.57s -> 23304.97s]  Up is being deleted, so we're going to go with the next highest one. It is books and
[23305.93s -> 23324.10s]  beaks in space. Books lost in space. Where is it? Break ball lost in space. No, I'm
[23324.10s -> 23330.52s]  not going to play checkers for an hour and a half with chat. We've got 700,000 games to
[23330.52s -> 23346.58s]  get through. This one's going to be a disaster. I'm going to do this one really quick. This
[23346.58s -> 23383.66s]  one. Here we go. Okay. Cool. I can't see. I can't see. What do I get? What do I
[23383.66s -> 23461.50s]  get? Can you guys see what's going on? Got it. I think we hard pass the ones that
[23461.58s -> 23494.73s]  cannot be opened correctly. You know what I'm saying? It's 40% of these. Yeah, guess what?
[23494.73s -> 23508.98s]  And 40% of your votes aren't counted because of this. Oh, bowling. I know it says bowling.
[23508.98s -> 23520.33s]  Cosmo Alley Bowling. Let's hope this one works. Undemocratic. Well, come on. Cosmo
[23520.33s -> 23571.00s]  Alley Bowling. I played this one. Did it open on your computer? That's a start. Run
[23571.00s -> 23578.82s]  as admin. I did. I've done it on a bunch of them already. I'll try this one. This whole
[23578.82s -> 23584.74s]  thing right now is open in Windows 7 compatibility, which it's supposed to be and in administrator
[23584.74s -> 23588.18s]  mode. I've tried to open them from their own respective folders in administrative mode
[23588.18s -> 23594.70s]  and it doesn't do anything. I will try this one more time. See if we can get it to work.
[23594.70s -> 23606.25s]  It's just a whole lot of bullshit. If you ask me. That one was called Cosmo Alley Bowling.
[23608.71s -> 23614.34s]  There it is. Properties. We got to make sure it is compatible. Compatibility. Yes.
[23615.14s -> 23624.44s]  And it's as administrator. Try it again. It is, right? Okay. Come on.
[23628.26s -> 23635.74s]  Jerma sounds fed up. I just can't believe they released a second one of these.
[23636.30s -> 23652.46s]  And it didn't work. The arrogance on releasing a second one. The
[23652.46s -> 23673.43s]  insolence. The arrogance of doing a version two. You don't know how scams work. Hold on.
[23675.53s -> 23702.82s]  What company is this? What else have they done? This is Viva Media. Wild Tangent. What? No,
[23702.82s -> 23727.67s]  it's not. What else have they made? Where have I heard this name before? I swear to God,
[23727.67s -> 23748.47s]  I've heard this name somewhere. Oh my God. Stalker. Call of Pripyat. Are you kidding me?
[23748.47s -> 23757.91s]  I knew I heard this name of this company before. No way. Who made it? No, that's not the same
[23757.91s -> 23778.04s]  company. That's GSC Game World. Why would Viva Media be connected to Stalker? Hold on. Viva
[23778.04s -> 23786.06s]  Media Games. Take a look at what pops up in the first thing. Strange. Maybe there's like
[23786.06s -> 23799.53s]  a weird keyword in there. It's a publisher. The conspiracy deepens. What the fuck are you
[23799.53s -> 23813.56s]  guys doing? No, no, no, no. Don't do that. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, I'm not going to condone
[23813.56s -> 23822.86s]  that. I'm not going to condone that kind of behavior. No, I'm not even going to say it
[23822.86s -> 23826.70s]  because I don't even want to give it attention. I don't want to condone that behavior. So I'm
[23826.70s -> 23840.47s]  not going to give it attention. Nope. No. No. Pick the next game. What is this
[23840.47s -> 23844.62s]  coffee pasta here? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I need to fucking, I need to,
[23844.62s -> 23847.90s]  I gotta paste this on the screen because I, hold on, that went by too fast.
[23878.30s -> 23881.74s]  Users have complained that the company's products have an adverse effect on their PC's
[23881.74s -> 23887.18s]  performance or are intrusive to the user's experience. PC Magazine wrote in 2004 that
[23887.18s -> 23891.42s]  although the program is not very evil, some privacy complaints were justified as the
[23891.42s -> 23897.02s]  program's user manual states that it may collect name, address, phone number, email,
[23897.02s -> 23901.18s]  and other contact information and could distribute the collected information with the
[23901.18s -> 23917.37s]  user's consent. Where did you get this from? Did one guy make this up? I think one guy may
[23917.37s -> 23930.17s]  have made this up. No. Did one guy make this fucking story up? And I gave it administrator.
[23952.15s -> 23955.48s]  You know what I think is a great title? I think it's a fun
[23956.12s -> 23966.34s]  series of games. 700,000 games is a fun thing. It's fun. I think I just want to make sure
[23967.30s -> 23972.90s]  that, oh my God, there's no, what do I, okay, time to play fucking, oh well, we're in too
[23972.90s -> 23990.92s]  deep already. Let's fucking keep going. Somebody wrote, it's not fun. Why bother?
[23991.72s -> 23997.69s]  But that may have just been a jokey copy pasta. I don't want to like say that that's,
[23997.69s -> 24001.77s]  I just want to make sure we're clear. That could just be like a gotcha streamer moment
[24001.77s -> 24005.61s]  and whatever. I'm going to just say it is because I don't want to fucking think that
[24005.69s -> 24028.17s]  that happened. What? It's, I'm never going to be able to look at this and knock, oh my God.
[24029.91s -> 24034.55s]  No, but this isn't wild tangent though. This is, the company name was just listed there.
[24040.46s -> 24046.30s]  I'm not going to fucking play. Connect four again. Okay. You have to pick something else.
[24048.50s -> 24051.86s]  That's a wild tangent Wikipedia. That's not even the same company.
[24062.90s -> 24076.60s]  Can one person collect something else? They know your garage door password.
[24079.90s -> 24088.06s]  Is nobody clicking? Am I, is my click fucked up?
[24099.77s -> 24102.41s]  I just was through it because of this. I just saw a hundred percent again.
[24106.46s -> 24124.62s]  Oh, we have to refresh it because that's not going to work. What are you guys doing?
[24128.04s -> 24137.80s]  Oh my God. All right. It looks like we're going to enchanted worlds, enchanted worlds,
[24138.68s -> 24146.46s]  13%. 26% of everybody is throwing their vote into the garbage can into the garage door.
[24149.43s -> 24153.27s]  Enchanted worlds. That sounds like fun to me. I'm glad people are just clicking
[24153.27s -> 24169.05s]  random places on the screen. I genuinely made this. Yeah. It's me slapping myself in the face.
[24170.18s -> 24177.66s]  We're picking games like you asked enchanted world. Does it open? I don't know. We'll
[24177.66s -> 24195.13s]  find out. It's data including phone numbers, addresses, email addresses. Here it comes.
[24195.69s -> 24205.16s]  Are we talking about the face slap? No. Well, all this one did is just made my
[24205.16s -> 24213.00s]  screen look fucked up. This one works. It's not the game. All right. Enchanted worlds.
[24232.82s -> 24239.40s]  How to play. It's divided into cells. Each cell can contain a letter. To guess a word,
[24239.40s -> 24243.56s]  you should select the letters in the order in which they're used by clicking on them and
[24243.56s -> 24267.43s]  then press the submit button. Guess a word. How you can hear me. Gotcha. Half-Life 2?
[24268.79s -> 24274.87s]  Half-Life scores. Music is too quiet. No, it's in a perfect audible level.
[24279.93s -> 24286.68s]  There. All right. Treasure mode. I didn't even start. This removes your previous game.
[24287.80s -> 24299.80s]  Continue. What are you talking about? I've never opened this game. This is actually kind
[24299.80s -> 24313.62s]  of scaring me. Okay. So we got satir. It's already on the list. Okay. Tyrannosaurus.
[24314.82s -> 24353.02s]  The word's already on the list. I just put it there. You have to be connected.
[24377.61s -> 24408.34s]  Irui. It's already there. Well, they gotta be connected. What does this do? Oh, you add
[24408.34s -> 24427.64s]  letters. What? Oh, man. Just get them all up there. Make this easier. Okay. OBS. The
[24427.64s -> 24458.26s]  streaming platform. Ghoul. Ghoul could be one. Nice. That word doesn't exist. The word ghost
[24458.26s -> 24504.15s]  does not exist. Are you sure? Bot? I have no idea. I don't have a single clue. Taste. Tasty.
[24505.19s -> 24542.06s]  Food. A-S-T. They have to be connected. Ta. Tab. Ghost in closet. Run. R-U. There's no U.
[24543.02s -> 24554.30s]  Obo. Why is my acoustic foam on the ground? Because it's falling off the walls for some reason.
[24555.50s -> 24610.47s]  Chanted words is done. Snowball. Snowball in. Oh, boy. This is people have kind of lost their
[24610.47s -> 24620.54s]  minds here. Snowball bust out is the one. This next one. Okay. The whole top row. Yeah,
[24620.54s -> 24625.67s]  we're going. Snowball bust out. We got to pick up the pace. We got to get this done
[24625.67s -> 24648.18s]  in the next 30 minutes. Snowball bust out does not open. So call it. Try again. What's this one?
[24648.90s -> 24666.01s]  Business boardwalk. Seen a lot of clicks. Board. Business boardwalk. Get it open. It opens.
[24666.01s -> 24686.20s]  That's a good sign. You guys can't even fucking see. Speaking of not being able to see.
[24686.20s -> 24700.79s]  Hold on. What happened to OBS? It doesn't exist. It's off my monitor. I don't know
[24700.79s -> 24713.83s]  where OBS is. You guys are going to have to tell me if you can see this because there's
[24713.83s -> 24731.21s]  no way I can. You let me know. You can't even see anything. I'm going to drag the window down.
[24731.85s -> 24745.14s]  Try this again. I have to exit the game. So I have to go from, I have to drag it.
[24745.78s -> 24760.49s]  So I have to take this and drag this down here. Like that. Probably right. I would assume
[24760.49s -> 24769.42s]  something like that. Give it a try. All we can do is try. What the fuck was this game called?
[24772.15s -> 24801.66s]  Boardwalk. Can you see? See it? Come on. Did I do it right? All right. Here we go.
[24801.66s -> 24819.05s]  New game. Select your card. Red, beige, teal. Teal. Add a human player. No, no, no, no.
[24819.05s -> 24827.91s]  Computer player. God damn it. Computer. Add a computer. Add a computer. All right. Start.
[24828.95s -> 24834.49s]  Is this going to be, is this Monopoly? Holy shit. This is Monopoly.
[24834.49s -> 24841.05s]  What are these gems? Racket? They're taunting me here with the tennis bullshit.
[24849.72s -> 24855.75s]  Five. Owning a store entitles you to collect rent from other players.
[24870.90s -> 24884.17s]  It's cereal box Monopoly. Let us play Monopoly. Guys, you understand the,
[24885.13s -> 24895.30s]  what are you going to click on? There's roll the dice. I can just roll the dice for you.
[24895.30s -> 24903.86s]  I got the wheel of death. Place your bet on red and black, high, low. If you win,
[24903.86s -> 24908.26s]  your bet will be multiplied by two. When the outcome is zero, your bet will be multiplied by 13.
[24909.30s -> 24954.17s]  What the hell was that called? All in? Dear idiot. GG. All right, guys. We're at the point
[24954.17s -> 24962.42s]  of the stream where I'm going to start just fucking opening. Maybe one or two more picks
[24962.42s -> 24970.52s]  and then I'm just going to blow through them and we're going to try to find a good one.
[24970.52s -> 24977.26s]  What happened? What's a little Kirby fucker in the left? I'm getting tired.
[24978.06s -> 25001.78s]  That looks like we're doing Kirby. This is called Lil' Herder. It's called head drama.
[25003.58s -> 25017.14s]  This is full screen, but is it actually full screen? We'll find out in a minute.
[25017.14s -> 25026.79s]  It's possible we win. We may have found the best game.
[25053.11s -> 25056.71s]  And it could go in a window. Best game of the night coming up. I know. I know. You
[25056.71s -> 25058.87s]  can't see. I know. You can't see. I know. You can't see. I know. You can't see. I know.
[25058.87s -> 25061.51s]  You can't see. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Now you can.
[25071.24s -> 25079.26s]  All right. Lil' Herder. Welcome, Jeremy. Play. It's like game world and level.
[25081.34s -> 25088.98s]  And we found the next piece of copyright infringement as clear as day.
[25088.98s -> 25098.86s]  As absolutely clear as the sun shining. That is Kirby's face, but just poorly photoshopped.
[25098.86s -> 25119.70s]  Very poorly. I even said little Kirby guy. Look at the circle here. Not even an attempt
[25119.70s -> 25126.23s]  to feather the edge. Nope. Just drag it over in Photoshop and press quick export as PNG.
[25134.33s -> 25138.41s]  We've kind of, like somebody said, we've kind of just transcended to bootleg.
[25141.96s -> 25149.70s]  Let's try it. It's probably going to be really, really fun. Speaking of fun,
[25151.75s -> 25172.46s]  resizing this window again is going to be real fun. Oh my goodness. In 2014,
[25174.02s -> 25181.64s]  just dumping school projects. You know what? There are school, some of you guys that have made
[25181.64s -> 25190.66s]  video games as a school project. Seriously, it's absolutely a thousand times better than this.
[25195.72s -> 25206.01s]  Absolutely. World one. Angry Birds. World one is fine. I don't know what's going on.
[25206.73s -> 25211.69s]  Click here to place an arrow. You have to guide the wandering sheep to its home to win.
[25211.69s -> 25235.46s]  This is fun. It actually is. Who recommended this? Nice.
[25238.87s -> 25252.92s]  I was not expecting Chu Chu Rocket or the Zumbinis. Send the wolf into the hole.
[25253.72s -> 25256.04s]  Don't need this arrow now. Remove it with the right mouse button.
[25263.18s -> 25278.12s]  How you make them run into the... Ah, I get it. They run into each other.
[25279.08s -> 25284.62s]  They're just starving them. Real nice. Hey, real nice.
[25329.59s -> 25333.59s]  Oh man, we're getting... I gotta perk up, man. We're getting low energy here.
[25334.55s -> 25342.20s]  When I was playing the piano, I'm just sitting here like this. Look where I am right now.
[25342.76s -> 25350.68s]  I'm all the way back. I gotta get high energy. I got low energy here.
[25350.68s -> 25379.48s]  I can't fucking believe this shit. You going to sleep? Have a great night.
[25380.12s -> 25385.16s]  I know we're going late. A lot of you guys probably got the fuck out of here a while ago,
[25385.16s -> 25393.64s]  but thanks for coming. Tutorial done. Now it's my turn. What happened to my arm?
[25394.44s -> 25399.80s]  Okay, that was weird. I'm trying to get high energy again. Let me clean this shit off.
[25400.52s -> 25421.96s]  Looks better, right? I just like made my skin... Now don't even mention that because
[25421.96s -> 25428.36s]  that's for the ASMR joke video. I almost just mentioned a stellar joke that is hysterical.
[25429.24s -> 25435.74s]  Don't want to fuck that up until you see that. Almost. What am I doing here? Is that in the
[25435.74s -> 25456.63s]  shape to hell? How many arrows do I get? Oh, well I did it. What? Oh, I lost time.
[25525.85s -> 25547.43s]  Oh, I need to... and spin it. He's getting tired. I really am. I'm dropping energy.
[25548.15s -> 25554.02s]  It's falling. I'm trying to stay with it. I'll get it. I'll stick with it.
[25555.06s -> 25578.50s]  I don't have very many more to go. Don't worry. I only have mahjong. 100,000. I'm going to beat
[25578.50s -> 25611.61s]  this level and this actually was kind of fun. Where is this one? Williams. Oh, I waited that
[25611.61s -> 25625.54s]  one just go. Oh shit, there it is. That was fun. Little Kirby. There's so many left.
[25627.58s -> 25632.78s]  There's too many. There's too many. I didn't... I thought I could get this done in one stream.
[25635.77s -> 25642.01s]  How many more are actually left? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven,
[25642.01s -> 25645.93s]  twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty, twenty-one,
[25645.93s -> 25648.25s]  twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six. There's like
[25648.25s -> 25660.06s]  six more hours here. Just... I'm going to start opening them. Jewel mines. Go.
[25660.06s -> 25681.54s]  No more voting. Jewel mines. This is from the video. What did I say here?
[25683.06s -> 25687.14s]  Five community subs. Thank you for the five community subs skill. Really appreciate it.
[25687.14s -> 25700.84s]  Thank you. That was jewel mines. What's left? Jewel mines. We got a monster truck
[25700.84s -> 25720.14s]  stunt rally. Here it comes. Someone took a screenshot of the ghosts. What ghosts?
[25727.42s -> 25742.78s]  Ghosts. What the hell did I just do? I have no idea. Oh, this is the music. I remember this
[25742.78s -> 25748.87s]  one. Oh, great. That's yeah. Good ghost.
[25775.48s -> 25787.10s]  That was playing really poorly as if I was playing it. That's as good as it's going to
[25787.10s -> 25804.87s]  get. Uh, monster truck rally. Go. Do the tree one next? Yeah, I will. I lost.
[25804.87s -> 25843.19s]  I forgot about this. Shit. The same exact thing happened in the video. Remember this
[25843.19s -> 25859.35s]  one? I did a James Bond reference here, right? References. References. Press H. Tree.
[25859.35s -> 25871.61s]  How do I do this? Change? The fuck? Frames jump. Eight. Dry river bullet. Half ring easy.
[25872.33s -> 25881.43s]  Hemispheres. Mixed course. Reverse climb. Simple jump. Spider truck. Spikes. The loop. Bullet.
[25884.79s -> 25885.59s]  Bullet. Let's try.
[25894.22s -> 25902.25s]  Community made workshop maps. That was very deceiving. I thought that was a
[25902.25s -> 25914.49s]  jump that they forgot to put the gray part in. That's not a checkpoint. Where's the
[25914.49s -> 25928.95s]  checkpoint then? That's not a checkpoint either. None of these are checkpoints.
[25930.54s -> 25956.42s]  Why is this called bullet? The game crashed. It did not. Do the loop?
[25958.34s -> 25962.28s]  I definitely did not play this in the video, did I?
[25968.58s -> 25974.34s]  I didn't even know how to change courses. I'm not sure I even attempted.
[25982.54s -> 25984.14s]  That's... why was it that loud?
[25991.69s -> 26027.61s]  Cool. All right, that was those two. Am I going to be able to get this
[26027.61s -> 26037.67s]  through these tonight? I'm not sure I'm gonna. What's left? The ghost in the closet.
[26040.02s -> 26052.01s]  Is it time to go to bed? It might be time to end this. It's been like almost seven and a half
[26052.01s -> 26059.66s]  hours of one of the fucking worst things ever. Do teapot pyre. We're gonna do... here's what
[26059.66s -> 26069.58s]  we're gonna do. We're gonna do... oh my god. I did not think this is gonna be this long.
[26070.60s -> 26078.98s]  We spent way too much time on checkers. Let's go over what these are gonna be.
[26079.70s -> 26086.94s]  And we'll play the ones that are worth playing, okay? Let me see here. So we've got
[26088.06s -> 26097.77s]  star cosmic bust out. Uh, yeah. No. That's gonna be a breakout clone. Star cosmic invaders. Uh,
[26097.77s -> 26111.32s]  yeah. That's a breakout clone. Seek and find collection two. Hey, how about that? Wait,
[26111.32s -> 26150.60s]  wait, wait. I'm gonna mark... We're going straight through part two tomorrow. No,
[26150.68s -> 26155.62s]  I can't. We can't do a part two. Part two is only going to be like an hour and 10 minutes.
[26168.84s -> 26175.91s]  Part two plus kanji. No, we got... We can do it. It's only... What time is it? 11, 12,
[26175.91s -> 26183.16s]  1, 2. It's 2 a.m. Eastern. That's fucking late as hell. All right. All right. All right.
[26183.16s -> 26205.58s]  All right. All right. This is the plan, okay? Tomorrow we are going to do the remaining, uh,
[26207.03s -> 26220.49s]  games. And, and, and, and, because it's only going to probably take like an
[26220.49s -> 26233.45s]  hour or two, I've wanted to play Lucius 3 for quite a long time. So we're gonna do...
[26234.57s -> 26246.82s]  We're gonna do this tomorrow and probably Lucius 3 as well. They made a two. Yeah,
[26247.83s -> 26254.09s]  they made a three. It really flew under the radar like crazy,
[26258.12s -> 26262.60s]  but it is getting really late. I really thought we were going to blow through this,
[26262.60s -> 26275.51s]  but we put a lot of time into checkers. So it's time for bed. Actual end of the stream voice.
[26275.51s -> 26280.39s]  We'll do it tomorrow and then we will, depending on, I mean, it depends on how long
[26280.39s -> 26285.32s]  that takes. I don't think we'll take that long. Look at all these Xs. We really only
[26285.32s -> 26292.92s]  have to probably have like another two, maybe two and a half hours. Take those Xs off. Yeah,
[26292.92s -> 26305.30s]  you know, I need to take, like somebody screen cap this shit. There we go. We have
[26305.30s -> 26316.87s]  quite a few decent ones to go through tomorrow. He plays one game for 11 hours,
[26316.87s -> 26326.25s]  can't play 700,000 for seven hours. Yeah, but that was one. I feel like my brain is
[26326.25s -> 26336.20s]  overstimulated. So we'll pick back up tomorrow the way we left off here. Still gonna do the
[26336.20s -> 26354.70s]  bits in game. Yeah, let me just pee and we'll come back into the bits. Does it feel wrong
[26354.70s -> 26359.02s]  leaving the stream half done? We're more, we are way more than half done. We're like 70%
[26359.02s -> 26367.78s]  done. There'll always be a part two, don't worry. So I'll see you tomorrow for this part
[26367.78s -> 26378.20s]  two. Lucius three. Depends on how quickly we go through these and I'm gonna go pee.
[26378.20s -> 26511.32s]  I'll be right back. See you guys in a second. Did you guys see the ghost? Holy, what the
[26511.32s -> 26525.50s]  heck? So probably like three, three thirty tomorrow. We'll get back into it. But for
[26525.50s -> 26534.68s]  now, let's go back a ways. Thank you binary man for the six dollars. Appreciate it.
[26536.20s -> 26542.17s]  Uh, this is watch the whole thing for the full experience. This file has been scanned
[26543.05s -> 26547.85s]  with the binary anti gnome system. Zero gnomes have been detected. Shut your traps. Be brave
[26547.85s -> 26554.33s]  shit asses. Be brave assholes. Be brave shock suckers. Be brave. Where did you get this?

[26574.44s -> 26587.67s]  brave. I can't fucking believe it. I thought that guy was gone forever. Never have I ever
[26587.67s -> 26598.23s]  experienced something like that where one video there's an audio file and a voice actor that's
[26598.23s -> 26613.29s]  there and the next video he's gone. Here's the link. They replaced him with a bunch of
[26613.29s -> 26618.17s]  other random shit. But thank you binary man for 12 total dollars is another message here.
[26619.75s -> 26629.02s]  Uh, anti gnome scan. There is zero gnomes here. Sometimes more unexpected sound. Drunk
[26629.02s -> 26637.00s]  frog reviews French champagne to grab our attention. French French like this desert
[26637.00s -> 26646.04s]  rain frog champagne squeaking viral sensation. Champagne champagne has always been celebrated.
[26646.04s -> 26655.40s]  11 million hits and counting. It sounds like a dog toy. But actually this is a sonorous war cry.
[26656.20s -> 26663.18s]  Oh my god this is so fucking stupid. Of a very angry frog.
[26668.81s -> 26672.66s]  Thank you binary man for the 12 dollars and two great videos.
[26673.82s -> 26677.10s]  Sprio thanks for the one dollar show this to chat they might like it. Jerma snort.

[26709.06s -> 26711.86s]  because I gotta see how many I gotta make sure I get all the references correct.
[26713.82s -> 26718.06s]  So we need to make sure we gotta go after I'm done we're gonna go back and see how many
[26718.62s -> 26727.42s]  references were made. But thank you Jay Paul. Thank you bake me home for the two dollars.
[26727.42s -> 26732.90s]  They say money thank you. Mo's cow or moose cow thanks for the 15 dollars.
[26733.78s -> 26749.51s]  Oh is Nova streaming? Yeah he is. Well when we get done with the bits we'll go say hello.
[26758.17s -> 26767.05s]  Super Mario Deluxe is sounds interesting. You could have finished the games if you ignored
[26767.05s -> 26776.04s]  the bits. No but I'm I am like faded right now. I'd rather attack this tomorrow and be able to
[26776.04s -> 26781.16s]  have some more energy and have fun. Because like I was just like that last two games was just I
[26781.16s -> 26798.70s]  was in the back of my chair slumped over. So don't worry it's like not even 12 24 hours
[26798.70s -> 26806.50s]  from now. But thank you for the 15 dollars. Moose cow. Hey Germanists would like to say
[26806.58s -> 26811.30s]  that the new year starts that we all really appreciate the effort and dedication to
[26811.30s -> 26814.34s]  streaming that you put in. And over the six years I've been watching your videos and some
[26814.34s -> 26819.62s]  streams it really has been able to uplift me through some tough times. And I would just
[26819.62s -> 26830.98s]  like to say thanks. Absolutely thank you. Thank you so much. New year we're gonna have a
[26830.98s -> 26842.78s]  lot of fun. Thank you so much. Moose cow for the 15 dollars. Super seal I wonder if this

[26849.64s -> 26856.92s]  So you did you did send a dollar within like 10 seconds. So your first the first one didn't
[26856.92s -> 26865.96s]  have a message. I'll count it. I'll count it. Uh thank you the milkman for the one dollar.

[26884.76s -> 26892.76s]  around with. It's called Salmon Max. Save the world. It is it's a comedy point and click.
[26893.64s -> 26897.72s]  It's very charmful and funny with dialogue and puzzles. It's kind of hard to solve but
[26897.72s -> 26902.78s]  you'll enjoy solving them. Game is a bit slow to start. It's well worth getting deep
[26902.78s -> 26912.06s]  into it. Oh it also has rats. Yeah uh Salmon Max has been recommended and talked about before.
[26912.62s -> 26918.79s]  Maybe on one of these days where I'm just kind of hanging out. That'll be fun.
[26920.66s -> 26928.15s]  Darkstar thanks for the five dollars. Oh sorry Darkstar 700,000 games. Of all the days you

[26931.11s -> 26936.15s]  ever made. You chose my birthday. Man you really are such a gift and maybe I'll sound
[26936.15s -> 26941.67s]  like an obsessive fan when I say this but you're seriously one of my favorite people on God's
[26941.67s -> 26950.73s]  green earth. Keep doing funny shit my dude and your name is very relevant today. Thank you for
[26950.73s -> 26958.82s]  the five dollars and thanks for the incredibly kind words. Happy birthday Darkstar 700,000
[26958.82s -> 26972.70s]  games. My favorite part about this is the is the ultimate bait because this is just the same
[26972.70s -> 26988.04s]  pack. I'm reliving this shit again but it is fun. It's always fun. Thank you Flank Tank for
[26988.04s -> 26991.64s]  the one dollar. Hey Jerma given the last of my bits before I buy more was watching Incredibles
[26991.64s -> 27005.43s]  2 the other day and I gotta say this was my favorite scene. I mean it looks bored. I thought
[27005.43s -> 27011.82s]  Vi would want to change a pace from driving. This is a spoiler. This is gonna be like a
[27011.82s -> 27022.31s]  am I gonna like play a spoiler on screen? No. Like driving food. Does this mean vegetables?
[27022.31s -> 27027.83s]  A balanced diet means vegetables kiddo. Get used to it. Good evening everyone.
[27033.93s -> 27037.77s]  Thank you uh Swiggity Swanky for the one dollar. You wonder why I don't show videos
[27037.77s -> 27045.90s]  on stream on the camera unless I know what they are. Thank you Flank Tank. Thank you Swiggity
[27045.90s -> 27058.57s]  Swanky for the one dollar. Here it is. Here is what? One right after the other really?

[27066.26s -> 27072.92s]  Capo. Avon Grad thanks for the one dollar streamer. So good at 700,000 games. He
[27073.88s -> 27099.50s]  Integra overflows and becomes bad at every single one. What? DG idiot. What word is that?
[27100.06s -> 27107.53s]  Am I saying that word wrong? Thank you P337R for the five dollars. Hey Jerma.

[27123.58s -> 27133.62s]  Is this the song? I don't think so.
[27139.86s -> 27157.48s]  Maybe it is. It might be. Drop that song link.
[27158.28s -> 27167.75s]  There you go. By the way there's a gnome in there. Thank you. It's time for slime. I'm not sure if
[27167.75s -> 27174.33s]  that's what I was thinking of but it might be. Thank you Concerto for the five dollars. Hey
[27174.33s -> 27178.74s]  Jerma you might be thinking of the mob song from Beauty and the Beast. Also the original
[27178.74s -> 27182.58s]  700,000 games is one of my favorite videos of yours. So I'm super happy you're doing
[27182.58s -> 27185.86s]  this. Thank you.
[27208.30s -> 27214.65s]  That's all I know. I don't know anything else in that whole song.
[27215.99s -> 27226.60s]  I don't think that's it though. Alec thanks for the one dollar Alec 4x4. Hey cool guy what kind of
[27226.60s -> 27232.76s]  Timberland Yeezy Supreme Gucci Jordan AirPods you got. If you're rich enough to afford 700,000
[27232.76s -> 27242.81s]  games you have to have all the brands on one product. Where was this during drunk karaoke
[27242.81s -> 27259.83s]  night? Drunk karaoke night? When was I drunk doing karaoke? I have Bo's one earphone. Thank
[27259.83s -> 27263.67s]  you though Alec. Thank you C4G for the three dollars. How can one streamer afford so many games?
[27264.39s -> 27273.61s]  Because they're in a big package. They come in one disc. Now thank you Dr. Clay for the one dollar.
[27273.61s -> 27287.43s]  I got no words. Bug frenzy. Windows game 2004. It says it's Minecraft. Is it because
[27287.43s -> 27291.11s]  of the textures? That's kind of what like cobblestone looks like. Is it like pulling
[27291.11s -> 27300.30s]  the cobblestone algorithm? Might be. FGWGWF thanks for the 30 dollars. Thank you.
[27301.02s -> 27307.00s]  So I guess Twitch isn't gonna refund my bits so I might as well give them to you.
[27308.22s -> 27312.62s]  You've been a huge comedic inspiration to me and since I started watching back in 2011
[27313.18s -> 27316.06s]  you've given me nothing but laughs all these years. Thanks for being yourself no matter what.
[27316.78s -> 27323.83s]  It's all I can be. I really appreciate that. I'm really sorry that you can't. Twitch had a
[27323.83s -> 27332.84s]  bug that had you buy a shitload of bits but I am humbled that you would want to give them
[27332.84s -> 27345.96s]  all to me. So thank you so much and I'm honored to be an inspiration. Thank you. Bezos isn't
[27345.96s -> 27351.93s]  sorry. Hans Beats thanks for the two bucks. Yo Jumbo Dumbo. Have you ever considered playing
[27351.93s -> 27358.30s]  the original Fable from 2004? One of the best games ever. I do enjoy that game. I think it's
[27358.30s -> 27363.98s]  very good. I've played through it probably twice. I played the remastered one and the
[27363.98s -> 27369.98s]  original one and The Lost Tales whatever the hell it was. The Lost Levels. It's a great game.
[27372.23s -> 27381.38s]  Maybe not on stream though. It's great. Jumbo Dumbo. Banana and Banan- Banan- Bananurism thanks for
[27381.38s -> 27385.67s]  the one dollar. I've been super sick the past few days. The stream has been doing a really good
[27385.67s -> 27392.92s]  job of cheering me up. Hope you feel better and thank you for the one dollar. Get well.
[27392.92s -> 27401.56s]  Get well soon. Thank you to Darkstar 700,000 games again for one dollar.
[27401.64s -> 27409.21s]  Germa old. Germa one guy. We got new emotes. This is the best day ever. Yeah there's new emotes.
[27409.77s -> 27421.16s]  Well one of them has been here already but I made it a baseline emote. Germa expensive.
[27421.16s -> 27432.42s]  We'll be changing to something else. Something more appropriate. Didn't I learn my lesson the
[27432.42s -> 27439.54s]  last time that I played this game? Yeah but I thought we were gonna get all new lessons.
[27442.81s -> 27446.73s]  I guess the one good thing about this is you guys can see in real time. This is kind
[27446.73s -> 27453.03s]  of a behind the scenes video three years later. Because even though I got
[27453.03s -> 27459.11s]  baited into thinking this was the second one, you guys get to see in real time how fucking
[27459.11s -> 27466.73s]  ridiculous and horrible this is. So live behind the scenes three years later video.
[27468.84s -> 27477.00s]  It's called version 2 not 700,000 games 2. Well version 2. Why would they need to release
[27477.00s -> 27489.56s]  a whole nother product if not to put different shit in it for money?
[27493.53s -> 27500.28s]  700,000 games exists. 700,000 games version 2. You gotta assume that there has to be
[27500.28s -> 27509.70s]  a reason for that version to exist. Don't want to seem mean but it's kind of sad to think
[27509.70s -> 27518.15s]  about past Germa playing these alone and talking to himself. I mean you're describing
[27519.45s -> 27538.30s]  almost every video I've probably ever made. That's like making a video. Yeah thank you too.
[27539.26s -> 27549.96s]  Again Bala Koala. Just that guy. You guys gave a shitload of money. Thank you both of you.
[27550.76s -> 27553.96s]  Smelly boy thanks for the one dollar. Well if it's for another game,
[27554.68s -> 27564.39s]  here's your money greedy streamer. What do you mean greedy streamer? What did I do? Hey
[27564.39s -> 27570.34s]  flug boy. Thanks for the five dollars. Jesus I think this stream has given me PTSD to the video.
[27570.34s -> 27576.52s]  I just want to say hope you're doing well. Hope your heya is cheering you on all the way
[27576.52s -> 27581.82s]  to the end of this shit show of a race tonight. Also looked at the old pax photos
[27581.82s -> 27590.95s]  of when I met you and low-key got sad. Sad. You should be happy. It was a fun time.
[27591.51s -> 27604.98s]  I hope my donation is on soon. I have to pee so bad. Let me tell you I don't see it
[27604.98s -> 27610.07s]  for a little while. But thank you flug boy. Don't be sad. That's like that was a great
[27610.07s -> 27619.37s]  experience. I had a lot of fun. I always have fun when I do meet and greets. Stop so he can pee.
[27620.09s -> 27625.66s]  Did just that guy give another 20 dollars. How do I join? And don't question my choices on
[27625.66s -> 27633.26s]  getting your attention. How do you vote? I think we may have uh hopefully you have to
[27633.26s -> 27639.03s]  install the extension maybe or refresh the page. Hopefully you got it. Thank you just that
[27639.03s -> 27649.42s]  guy for the huge amount of money. Uh numble or no no it's numb legs not numble. Thanks for the
[27649.42s -> 27656.70s]  ten dollars and two cents. Love you Jeremy. Thank you. Stop so I can pee please. All right
[27656.70s -> 27671.32s]  go go go now. Right now. Quick read his message. No he can pee. Come right back.
[27671.32s -> 27681.90s]  Uh just that guy gave another 40 dollars. This is this is all part of just that guy's
[27682.70s -> 27691.45s]  uh spree of a shitload of money. So thank you just that guy. 40 dollars, 50 dollars,
[27691.45s -> 27701.37s]  50 dollars, 60 you've given an extreme amount. And they say cool witch will burn down your
[27701.37s -> 27708.18s]  village and will still be styling while doing it. I can't fucking believe you guys found that
[27708.18s -> 27726.65s]  so quickly. Thank you so much just that guy. You back? Did you pee? You're back. All right
[27726.65s -> 27730.31s]  welcome back. Hey frody and weapon thanks for the seven dollars. This stream has been
[27730.31s -> 27734.63s]  the highlight of my week. Thanks jerma heart. Which emote should most definitely be a thing?
[27736.15s -> 27743.00s]  Which emote? Well let me I need to see the legality of that. But thank you for the seven
[27743.00s -> 27756.62s]  dollars. It's time for slime. Gave the 50 dollars earlier showing the witch. For litty
[27757.42s -> 27762.94s]  we got you earlier too. 50 fucking dollars. Thank you guys. You guys are unbelievable.
[27764.89s -> 27768.09s]  Uh thank you scribble for the one dollar. This is the hardest I've laughed in a while.
[27768.09s -> 27778.44s]  Thanks jerma. The surfing witch. Yeah and that was that was ridiculous. Great Canadian fuck club.
[27780.50s -> 27784.58s]  Gave 10 community subs. I think I missed it. Amphiric gave five. Thank you both of you.
[27786.02s -> 27789.54s]  Solid milk. Thanks for one dollar. Great stream jerma. I just got a fireman shirt today
[27789.54s -> 27793.86s]  and your stream to give me something to look forward to. Fireman is one of the best
[27793.86s -> 27805.62s]  characters ever created so don't blame you. It's the spy theme from tf2. What's what is
[27805.62s -> 27819.80s]  the spy theme? What are you talking about? I think it actually is.
[27825.59s -> 27839.02s]  Well it was obvious. He's the red spy. Kill me. Yeah you got it I think.
[27839.74s -> 27848.26s]  But thank you solid milk. Thank you clockwork for the one dollar. Jerma our favorite gnome
[27848.26s -> 27854.71s]  has a song for you. I paid real money for you to listen to this. So please listen. This
[27854.79s -> 27863.96s]  is the guy's website. I'm not clicking on this. This is this is just clicking on a gnome
[27864.90s -> 27870.20s]  and knowing that I'm clicking on it. Just pretend I did. I paid money for that.
[27871.67s -> 27884.02s]  He paid real money to have me get gnomed. Yeah I'll do it for you. Look let me click it.
[27884.02s -> 27891.34s]  All right here it is. Clicked it.
[27891.34s -> 27896.78s]  Oh
[27900.09s -> 27913.35s]  Shit. Got me. He stopped the stream for me to pee. Now you have to listen to the song.
[27914.07s -> 27924.46s]  Well you only get to be the one guy at least once. No I mean you only get to be the one guy
[27924.46s -> 27936.10s]  once. You might not be the one guy again. Doesn't mean it won't happen. I stopped the stream
[27937.19s -> 27944.74s]  for you to go to the bathroom. As the one guy you clocked in your one guy ticket there.
[27948.12s -> 27952.12s]  Now you could another day you could. Like tomorrow the next day. But you can only
[27952.12s -> 27967.19s]  exchange one guy ticket once per day. Or maybe once a week. Not a gnome. And do I learn
[27967.19s -> 27973.02s]  anything? Thank you clockwork though. I hope you had a good bathroom break. Thank you
[27973.02s -> 27975.90s]  demonic cucumber for the one dollar. You never find the witch image. Can't you see?
[27976.46s -> 27979.10s]  It was the two images edited together. Chat has failed.
[27979.90s -> 27984.98s]  It really might be those two edited together to fuck with infringement.
[27986.39s -> 27999.19s]  Hey C Clampus thanks for the ten dollars. Tell Andre I say hi. Uh I don't who's what do
[27999.19s -> 28016.63s]  you mean Andre? Andre. All right well hi. Hi. Jess homeboy thanks for the one dollar. You say
[28016.63s -> 28020.23s]  how do they have the balls to be so lazy? But it's because people like you give them
[28020.23s -> 28028.15s]  eleven dollars for these half broken flash games. But no one else is buying this.
[28032.33s -> 28036.17s]  There's not there can't be that many people that purchase this game. They probably make like
[28036.89s -> 28049.64s]  three or four hundred dollars a year on these games. Thousands of moms buy for their kids.
[28049.64s -> 28056.34s]  I don't think that's even possible. Grandma Christmas presents? Maybe.
[28058.49s -> 28062.65s]  Dirtball Drop is a standalone game and it costs about six dollars so it's a great deal
[28062.65s -> 28076.14s]  actually. That's awesome. I love how you know that. That's kind of it is worth it. Maybe it is.
[28080.84s -> 28084.04s]  Thank you uh Sachari for the five dollars. This is the worst.
[28085.78s -> 28088.42s]  All right one okay we're getting to the point where I slapped myself in the face.
[28089.38s -> 28097.66s]  Uh thank you five dollars Sachari. Man-dom-rec-man-dom requiem thanks for the one dollar.
[28097.66s -> 28100.46s]  Captain Worgen thanks for one dollar. While watching this stream I keep having the
[28100.46s -> 28104.86s]  feeling it's going to cut off suddenly and the old Jerma outro is going to play.
[28107.02s -> 28116.90s]  Not tonight. Thank you Resolute Rogue for the ten dollars. No message just thanks for ten dollars.
[28116.90s -> 28122.79s]  Thank you. Means a lot. Tingy thanks for one dollar. After that slap you're going to be on
[28122.79s -> 28133.05s]  live uh mostly lost thanks for the one dollar. It's me slapping myself in face.
[28134.58s -> 28141.18s]  For some reason I don't know why but uh one anime review. Oh yeah that's right I forgot.
[28141.18s -> 28152.22s]  Huge announcement. I watched One Punch Man. It was it was pretty it was pretty great.
[28152.78s -> 28159.66s]  That was my 2019 anime. I'm only allowed to watch one. I thought it was really good.
[28160.22s -> 28181.30s]  I like the characters. Interesting concept. See you in 2020. Season two is coming out too.
[28181.30s -> 28185.86s]  Yeah I like when he punches people and he doesn't want in one time you know what I mean.
[28188.01s -> 28192.57s]  Hey thanks for the emote though. That will maybe one day be an emote. I don't know maybe.
[28193.29s -> 28196.57s]  Hey the wombat from hell thanks for the one dollar. I'm almost done with my senior year
[28196.57s -> 28200.57s]  but I feel worse than I ever have in my life because of what my doctor believes to be IBS
[28201.21s -> 28206.66s]  and OAB. I feel useless vulnerable and like I can't go anywhere without risking pain all the
[28206.66s -> 28210.98s]  time. I know you struggle with something similar in your youth and I was wondering
[28210.98s -> 28213.94s]  if you had any advice for managing getting through embarrassing medical problems at a young
[28213.94s -> 28222.41s]  age. Well first of all sorry that you're going through that because it sucks. Second of
[28222.41s -> 28231.13s]  all it is a it's a never-ending process. Sometimes I've actually I've been I felt pretty
[28231.13s -> 28240.63s]  good in the kind of IBD department but I've been having some issues recently but you just
[28240.63s -> 28246.87s]  got to get a good doctor. Try to get a good doctor that gives a shit and you just got to
[28246.87s -> 28255.72s]  try to manage it with medicine. Sometimes you might have to change your diet. That was a big
[28255.72s -> 28268.49s]  one for me. Try to keep a positive outlook even though it's hard to do. I had a lot of
[28268.49s -> 28276.50s]  fucking problems. I had I missed get togethers, family events. I almost missed my sister's wedding
[28277.14s -> 28282.66s]  because of that shit. I almost couldn't go or participate in my sister's goddamn wedding
[28283.46s -> 28292.07s]  so I know what it's like. I know how that feels. But a couple years later maybe three
[28292.07s -> 28299.30s]  years later four years later I started to feel better. I was on a good program. Started
[28299.30s -> 28309.82s]  doing a different medical procedure and I'm still I'm still going and I feel better than
[28309.82s -> 28325.19s]  I did absolutely six seven eight years ago. Just keep at it. It's tough. It really it sucks
[28325.75s -> 28331.27s]  and I wish there was some magic wand that I could wave to give you the answers and to tell
[28331.27s -> 28343.56s]  you that you know I would get rid of it. I wish I could. I love how somebody just wrote
[28343.64s -> 28352.97s]  Yeah fuck the Patriots. Honestly what conversation are you having? What?
[28366.01s -> 28371.78s]  But yeah that's the best advice I can give. Try to keep it's really easy to be negative
[28372.34s -> 28385.24s]  and to fall into the negative trap. Just try to balance your diet out and listen to your
[28385.24s -> 28392.78s]  doctor and go from there. Jeremy have you ever thought about that urinome because of how
[28392.78s -> 28402.47s]  small that I am? No gnomes are a foot and a half tall. Please please do not put me.
[28402.47s -> 28417.45s]  Excuse me. I'm at least I'm at least a high elf okay. At least give me that. At least.
[28427.11s -> 28433.66s]  I'm at least an elf and I'm not talking about the Christmas pack your presents elf.
[28434.38s -> 28445.78s]  I'm talking about a RPG elf. God I wish that was me. Hey mostly lost thanks for one dollar.
[28445.78s -> 28450.50s]  Those hidden object games were just somebody's sophomore project in computer science 210
[28450.50s -> 28458.25s]  that they tried to make money off of by copying 20 times. Maybe yeah I don't understand how
[28459.05s -> 28465.35s]  I guess you just have to bloat it up. Dark star 700,000 games thanks to the one dollar
[28465.35s -> 28470.79s]  you have to watch that slap clip again at half speed. It makes it infinitely funnier.
[28471.51s -> 28496.38s]  Where is it? How do I do that? Give me fucking break. Oh you want to fight? You want to
[28496.38s -> 28524.09s]  fuck? Fight me? Don't fuck? I don't know if I'm ready for this. Oh you want to fight? You
[28524.09s -> 28539.67s]  want to fuck? Fight me? Don't fuck come at me. Hold on. All right here we go. Let's see what
[28539.67s -> 28552.60s]  it's like. Oh you want to fight? You want to fuck? Fight me? Don't fuck come at me. Don't.
[28555.02s -> 28555.52s]  Oh.
[28563.08s -> 28572.50s]  Trunk. This is stone cold sober. This is on this is on caffeine and spaghetti.
[28573.82s -> 28594.98s]  You want to fight? Don't fuck come at me. Don't. You can see me trying to pull it back too.
[28594.98s -> 28626.14s]  That's the worst part. Fucking moron. It synced so well that it's the game. It is the game
[28626.14s -> 28630.78s]  sound because I was... play the other one. The other sound is the same exact sound.
[28630.78s -> 28645.70s]  Remember when I did it the first time? Can I fart backwards? What does that even mean?
[28645.70s -> 28650.86s]  All right we're almost done. Thank you to mostly lost for the one dollar.
[28651.58s -> 28658.55s]  Garfy the monday killer thanks for one dollar. Hold on this is this it?
[28659.11s -> 28673.30s]  It's just so fucking irritating. Yeah see. Listen to that sound. That's not that's the first
[28673.30s -> 28694.71s]  one. Fucking irritating. Lies. What? Uh but thank you Garfy the swiggity swanky gave me a sub so
[28694.71s -> 28698.95s]  I'm gonna give him a swiggity thanky. All the cats in the chat are nuts about your stream
[28698.95s -> 28707.62s]  Jerma. Make yourselves known cats and chat. Give us some of those poggers in here. The crowd is
[28707.62s -> 28717.32s]  going nuts. Garf is honored to be the honorary feline ambassador to the Jerma brand. Years from
[28717.32s -> 28720.52s]  now people are going to look back on these streams and say that's Garf up there up on the
[28720.60s -> 28725.96s]  stairs. I don't know why I'm up on the stairs. I probably got shipped off to space. Stars.
[28730.70s -> 28734.54s]  GoldenCricket thank you Garfy. Thank you GoldenCricket for the four dollars. Good stream Jerma.
[28734.54s -> 28739.02s]  Here is CeleryMan. Now Tain I can get into. Oh yeah I know what CeleryMan is.
[28746.71s -> 28754.20s]  Could you kick up the uh 43d 3d 3d 3d? Could you kick up the 4d 3d?
[28755.24s -> 28760.65s]  Thank you GoldenCricket. It's a classic. Uh demoniccucumber thanks for one dollar.
[28760.65s -> 28768.62s]  The guy on the tennis championship icon is me doing the the walk in quotes. Maybe. Darkstar
[28768.62s -> 28772.46s]  thanks for the one dollar. The chat draws a phallus on screen joke. Will never not be funny
[28772.46s -> 28778.14s]  because every time you just know that a room of 5,000 people all without words knew what they
[28778.14s -> 28786.70s]  would do. Yeah. Sirdub thanks for the one dollar. I've been watching your streams for
[28786.70s -> 28791.26s]  about a year. I'm hoping this 2019 goes well for the stream. I also suggest a game called
[28791.26s -> 28798.90s]  Infamous. I feel like you might like it. Yeah Infamous. It's cool. It's on the radar.
[28798.90s -> 28804.41s]  I actually was thinking about doing it a couple days ago but PS Now doesn't really work that
[28804.41s -> 28809.72s]  well for me. So I would probably want to figure out a way to do it without PS Now.
[28810.44s -> 28817.18s]  We'll look into it. Thank you Sirdub. Thank you MetalSocks for the ten dollars
[28817.18s -> 28822.34s]  super frog or riot. Played it in the is the first one we played. Thank you for the
[28822.34s -> 28828.94s]  ten dollars. Appreciate it. Thank you CompactViewer for the ten dollars.
[28829.66s -> 28833.59s]  It's been a few years now since my friend introduced me to you. We used to watch your
[28833.59s -> 28837.99s]  videos on the way home from school on the bus. Thanks for all the good memories. A fan.
[28840.39s -> 28847.26s]  Happy to be there on the bus. Thank you so much for watching for as long as you have.
[28849.21s -> 28855.56s]  CompactViewer thanks for the ten dollars. Am I the only one who wants Derma to go
[28855.56s -> 28859.80s]  with his Dreamcast promise? He's just been delaying it for so long it makes me sad.
[28870.66s -> 28873.86s]  It is just sitting back there. That's what the ghost was guys. Take a look.
[28874.66s -> 28885.29s]  The ghost is the Dreamcast. Look. You see? Can you see the Dreamcast? It's right there
[28885.29s -> 28898.30s]  on the right side. Top right next to the door. That's what the ghost was all along.
[28898.30s -> 28901.90s]  Hey PeacefulHaley thanks for the one dollar. I can't believe you lied about not liking
[28901.90s -> 28905.90s]  anime. How can I watch a streamer who watches anime? I'm so disappointed.
[28906.62s -> 28922.73s]  Why? It's a TV show. It's a television show. So he's never going to play Dreamcast because
[28922.73s -> 28933.11s]  it's a ghost. I don't base what genre of TV show or movie I'm going to watch.
[28934.55s -> 28941.46s]  How do people rate it? Is it rated? Has it got like an 89%? 78%? I might watch it.
[28946.30s -> 28949.90s]  It was enjoyable. I'm not going to go get a One Punch Man
[28950.86s -> 28959.05s]  14-inch figurine to put on my desk. I'm not going to dress up as Saitama for Halloween this year.
[28962.49s -> 28969.77s]  I'm not going to order the Blu-rays through Amazon Prime. All of those things are lies and
[28969.77s -> 28980.49s]  they're all on the way. Thank you Bonjor. Thank you Bonjor Tristan for the one dollar.
[28980.49s -> 28984.01s]  Bonjor Tristan again for the one dollar. Dermot please read this out loud.
[28996.06s -> 29015.85s]  What happened to F? It was a sign of respect. I lost two ranks in League. What happened?
[29015.85s -> 29026.73s]  I don't get it. This is how you meme kids are repaying me. Thank you Double D for the one
[29026.73s -> 29037.30s]  dollar. It's a clip. Oh yeah I'm not gonna help. Thank you Smelly Boy for the one dollar. This
[29037.30s -> 29043.54s]  is a fever dream. It sure is. Space Dad thanks for the one dollar. F G W G W F thanks
[29043.54s -> 29046.98s]  for the five dollars. All these games that won't open are all going to open at the same time
[29046.98s -> 29058.06s]  later tonight and nuke your PC. Oh that would be terrifying. Thank you Zaldi for the one dollar.
[29058.06s -> 29061.98s]  Dermot let's be real. The follow through on your pimp hand is godlike.
[29065.34s -> 29074.49s]  Thank you Jax for the five dollars. Jax3636. Thank you for five dollars. Appreciate it.
[29075.21s -> 29078.33s]  Demonic Cucumber thanks for the one dollar. This Connect Four game isn't fair. You could
[29078.33s -> 29082.09s]  literally see the next three moves we were planning from the get-go. If you want it to be
[29082.09s -> 29089.02s]  fair bring in a mediator or let us vote on grid references. No you guys can click the screen.
[29089.02s -> 29092.95s]  You know what you're doing. Hey Ike Turtle thanks for the one dollar. You ever thought
[29092.95s -> 29096.23s]  about doing board games with chat? Like a bunch of stuff. Tonight's stream with the
[29096.23s -> 29100.71s]  Connect Four was pretty fun. I think it would be wicked rad to do other games against it as
[29100.71s -> 29109.93s]  well. Also we can see how you cheat in other games as well. If there was a system
[29109.93s -> 29113.13s]  in place where because it is it's actually really hard to do what we were doing.
[29113.85s -> 29121.61s]  Because I have to activate the extension. Let you guys vote. Turn it off and restart it
[29123.21s -> 29127.93s]  for every single time you guys could click on the screen. So if there was a more streamlined
[29127.93s -> 29136.81s]  way to do that I would love to. It's an interesting idea if there's some extension
[29136.81s -> 29144.02s]  or something in the future might be worth trying. But it was fun. I had a blast.
[29145.26s -> 29151.66s]  Uh three TS Luke thanks for the five dollars. I haven't donated since you were in Anor Londo
[29152.30s -> 29160.94s]  so here's more patronage. Patronage. I just said Patreonage. The internet has destroyed me.
[29163.32s -> 29167.96s]  Thank you Fuzzy Muffins for the ten dollars. Thank you for playing with us Jerma. Gigi
[29167.96s -> 29174.58s]  idiot. You know you love it. Thank you Fuzzy Muffins for the ten bucks. I do. It's always
[29176.41s -> 29180.33s]  Dark Star. 700,000 games thanks for the one dollar. Just thought I'd ruin Connect 4 for you.
[29181.70s -> 29185.30s]  All right if neither player makes a mistake during the game the winner will be determined
[29185.30s -> 29191.94s]  by where the first piece was placed. If the first piece is placed on either end that player
[29191.94s -> 29197.30s]  will lose. If the first piece is placed in the center that player will win. And if the
[29197.30s -> 29206.36s]  first piece is placed that in the in between it will result in a draw. Good to know from
[29206.36s -> 29213.06s]  when I want to beat my friends. I mean and I already did tonight. You know you know you two
[29213.70s -> 29220.49s]  you two beat you guys. You two there. The two of you that were playing. Mostly lost thanks
[29220.49s -> 29225.62s]  for the one dollar. The game probably stole your stream key. Let's hope not. Peaceful Haley
[29225.62s -> 29228.66s]  thanks for the one dollar. Another good stream Jerma. Hope the Wild Tangent Studio doesn't
[29228.66s -> 29234.90s]  have your credit card and charge you 50 times for 50 more 700,000 games. Anyway I
[29234.90s -> 29238.50s]  would recommend playing Fallout 1. I just started playing it and the first thought I had
[29238.50s -> 29245.37s]  was well Jerma would enjoy this. Anyways again have a good night Jerma and chat. You as well
[29245.37s -> 29255.58s]  Peaceful Haley. Fallout 1 is a very very very fun game. It's kind of like Kenshi and I know
[29255.58s -> 29265.42s]  that comparison is very very thin but it's in the same house as Kenshi. They live in different
[29265.42s -> 29274.25s]  rooms. It's a Kenshi but fun. All right I am not gonna let somebody in the chat
[29275.13s -> 29280.89s]  say that Kenshi's not fun okay. Because that I don't believe that that is true. I believe
[29280.89s -> 29288.68s]  that that is not true. Okay I believe that that's not true. Done. And now you triggered
[29288.68s -> 29295.22s]  them. Space Dad thanks for the one dollar. They just have a heart. Thank you. Thank you
[29295.22s -> 29302.92s]  Space Dad. Thank you Tybe? Tib? I'm gonna call you Hovercat because that's the end of your
[29302.92s -> 29307.96s]  name and my brain cannot say the first part. Thank you Hovercat for the ten dollars. Hey
[29308.04s -> 29312.28s]  Jerma love your streams. A lot of folks in chat look up to you and consider you a positive
[29312.28s -> 29316.68s]  role model in their lives. My question to you is who do you look up to and consider to be
[29316.68s -> 29320.49s]  positive role models in your life? Thanks for all that you do. Never stop being you.
[29322.54s -> 29333.74s]  Um I don't know years ago I would have probably told you. George Washington.
[29337.32s -> 29349.02s]  Role models? I don't know about role models. I mean this is I mean this is a young Jeremy
[29349.02s -> 29355.11s]  answer and this is gonna people probably gonna put lul in the chat for this one but
[29355.11s -> 29380.41s]  I'm probably Hulk Hogan. I Hulk Hulk Hogan when I was in my early teens. Oh man I mean not
[29380.41s -> 29388.92s]  anymore. I don't I don't like oh yeah Hulk Hogan. No but in my kind of younger years
[29392.33s -> 29399.48s]  probably was Hulk Hogan. Into my late teens and teens probably 20s probably Jim Carrey.
[29401.29s -> 29409.38s]  I'm literally one of my favorite comedic actors ever. Jim Carrey has influenced so much in
[29409.38s -> 29420.92s]  the world of comedy that it's it's absolutely unbelievable. You go watch that string of Jim
[29420.92s -> 29431.94s]  Carrey 90s movies. Holy shit they are they're unmistakably some of the funniest movies you
[29431.94s -> 29442.33s]  will ever watch. He's changed a lot right recently but remember he's like he's also
[29442.33s -> 29448.84s]  gotten older too. He's gotten old. He's in his like what his 50s almost his 60s now.
[29454.09s -> 29462.25s]  It's hard to be to be Jim Carrey. The funny guy. He actually talks about that in that Jim
[29462.25s -> 29475.83s]  and Andy Netflix original. It's worth a watch. He's 56. Truman Show is one of my
[29475.83s -> 29494.98s]  favorite movies of all time. Oh my god yeah. Truman Show is fantastic. I mean do I agree
[29494.98s -> 29515.51s]  with literally everything he said in the last 10 years? No. Is Jim Carrey your dad?
[29515.51s -> 29527.42s]  Uh no but that's pretty much it. I would say those two. Thank you Space Dad for the five
[29527.42s -> 29534.39s]  dollars. They said uh moi. That's moi with French champagne. Uh chocolate cheese thanks
[29534.39s -> 29539.99s]  for the one dollar. Uh a bit of caution for Lucius 3. There's a really graphic
[29540.55s -> 29546.94s]  graphic scene. Oh dear. There's some really distasteful steam achievements
[29546.94s -> 29569.56s]  that go along with it. Uh well I'm gonna have to check that. The French champagne has always
[29569.56s -> 29576.50s]  been celebrated for its excellence. But thank you for the heads up. Thanks for the warning.
[29582.36s -> 29585.88s]  Thank you Razzle for the one dollar. Hey Jerm sorry to keep you here longer but I don't.
[29585.88s -> 29590.44s]  It's fine we're just hanging out. But I just had a quick question. You are so attentive
[29590.44s -> 29595.32s]  plus concerned about the few that don't enjoy your streams. How do you deal with negative
[29595.32s -> 29601.61s]  comments on your YouTube videos back in the day? Uh there's a YouTube link. Uh are you linking
[29601.61s -> 29614.38s]  to a comment here? Am I gonna feel bad right now? Is this gonna make me sad? Uh it's somebody
[29614.38s -> 29628.18s]  vaping. It was muted but it was a vape gnome. It was a gnome vape joke. It was muted so don't
[29628.18s -> 29632.50s]  worry. Uh how do I how do I I'm concerned about the few people that don't enjoy the
[29632.50s -> 29638.94s]  streams. I mean it's not necessarily. I don't think it's I don't think it's a concern about
[29639.90s -> 29648.09s]  people not enjoying the streams. I think it's a it's more of a concern of people thinking that
[29648.73s -> 29651.85s]  the thing that they're watching is not worth watching. Like boring.
[29652.81s -> 29656.49s]  I mean like enjoying the streams is kind of a hard way to look at it because
[29659.40s -> 29666.12s]  you can still enjoy something if it is boring right. There's plenty of things that I enjoy
[29666.12s -> 29676.44s]  that are boring. So not enjoying the streams. Yeah but like there's plenty of things that
[29676.44s -> 29686.84s]  are boring that you can still enjoy. I'm probably wording this in a in a stupid way but
[29687.64s -> 29691.64s]  negative comments you just have to take the opinion and somebody said it for a reason.
[29693.67s -> 29696.79s]  Somebody said something. Somebody didn't like something for a particular reason.
[29697.91s -> 29703.03s]  I get what you mean kind of. Well good. It's also been eight hours and I I need some
[29703.03s -> 29712.73s]  spaghetti so but you just kind of have to end. My internet is like going through a
[29712.81s -> 29720.14s]  problem right now. No we're good. But yeah you just have to let negative comments if somebody
[29720.14s -> 29723.90s]  wants to be mean or negative actually and not just I know a lot of people joke around we
[29723.90s -> 29729.18s]  go back and forth a lot of times for fun but there's a big there's a big difference between
[29729.18s -> 29736.46s]  mean and fun right. Like actually angry or like hateful and I don't know I can't change
[29736.46s -> 29741.43s]  that person's opinion. I'm not going to be able to. I told you guys this a couple days
[29741.43s -> 29747.59s]  ago or even like a couple weeks ago. I will never say like oh fuck the haters.
[29748.55s -> 29754.31s]  No because that I'm not going to change that person's mind so why antagonize them why why
[29754.31s -> 29758.23s]  why try to tell them that they're wrong. I'm not going to change their mind if they
[29758.23s -> 29763.96s]  don't think I'm funny if they don't think the streams are funny. What that's that's
[29763.96s -> 29767.80s]  their opinion and they're absolutely entitled and have a right to have that opinion.
[29769.27s -> 29773.03s]  I can't tell you that you're that's wrong because I don't know your tastes I don't
[29773.03s -> 29777.29s]  know what you think is interesting. I don't think this is I don't think you're very funny.
[29777.29s -> 29784.07s]  I don't think your streams are good. Uh well uh no you're you're wrong. I mean am I yeah it's
[29784.07s -> 29794.33s]  so subjective so it's I don't want to fight negative opinions because what's the point
[29801.35s -> 29804.23s]  just people are going to have different opinions and just that's it.
[29805.03s -> 29811.80s]  That's pretty much what I got to say. Hey P337R thanks for the three bucks. Hey again
[29811.80s -> 29821.88s]  Jerma will there be a new tier three emote? Yes there will. I want to make it worth
[29822.60s -> 29835.80s]  that was worth it before I think. No it wasn't. Make it the witch oh god I have to I don't know
[29835.80s -> 29839.40s]  if I can use that image for people to pay to use that image that I don't own.
[29840.46s -> 29849.21s]  That's kind of a slippery tricky slope there but we're almost to the end of the bits. Thank
[29849.21s -> 29852.25s]  you Darkstar for the one dollar wait if I change my name to reference another one of your
[29852.25s -> 29858.86s]  videos will you do a sequel to that one too? All right I guess I'm now dorkcube7000.

[29870.58s -> 29874.90s]  uh all right I know I didn't read it. Thank you Darkstar again Darkstar 700,000
[29874.90s -> 29878.58s]  games one dollar and ten cents. Is Jerma's slap more or less embarrassing than Jerma Raptor?
[29879.54s -> 29890.26s]  That's tough I don't know. No Jerma Raptor is more embarrassing. The slap was an accident.
[29890.26s -> 29898.68s]  The Raptor was intentional so absolutely the Raptor is way more embarrassing. Hey Fitty thanks
[29898.68s -> 29904.63s]  for the one dollar wow this stream good was the stream good should I watch the VOD just kidding
