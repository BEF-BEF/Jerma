[6.14s -> 16.39s]  Hey, please can you do another dot to dot stream? Oh, yeah, that was kind of fun.
[16.39s -> 29.29s]  That was a fun day. What's up? How you doing? You're late, Mr. Yeah, but you know what,
[29.29s -> 38.76s]  let's go. Let's talk about this. No streamers on time ever. This is a streamer issue. It's not
[38.76s -> 46.89s]  even a me issue. It's a streamer issue. It's just like, we all kind of just like things kind of,
[46.89s -> 51.85s]  you know, there's a lot going on right before we got to get ready. This streamer, it's us streamers
[51.85s -> 58.12s]  do this stuff. You know, there's tons of people that stream on time. That's excuses. You're the
[58.12s -> 78.12s]  problem. Nice copium. I'm at work right now. Well, be careful and you should just I don't want to
[78.12s -> 85.06s]  get you in trouble. Anyways, how are you? Merry Christmas. Happy holidays. Happy New Year. Let
[85.06s -> 92.95s]  me say all those because after today, you are not going to see me until after the New Year.
[94.73s -> 101.77s]  I was thinking about just not streaming and just kind of going on break and coming back in the
[101.77s -> 108.36s]  new year, but I feel that was kind of too long. Like two and a half weeks or something. No.
[109.46s -> 114.10s]  So I have some time and I have a lot of random stuff from the Christmas show.
[114.74s -> 126.36s]  So that was a wild day. A lot of people were a little confused, but you know, dude, you're muted.
[126.36s -> 129.16s]  How would I be muted if you have I'm reading comments of things I'm saying?
[135.35s -> 138.71s]  Yeah, that was a lot of moving parts. A lot of stuff happening on that show,
[139.59s -> 147.14s]  which I've wanted to do this show for about two years and just trying to find the right time
[148.02s -> 150.66s]  to. All right, we're going to go through that. All right, I want to go through that now.
[154.54s -> 163.80s]  Like bread and bread. What the hell is that? Dude, why is my P green? I don't why are you asking me
[163.80s -> 167.48s]  that? That's something you should you should go to urgent care and ask that question.
[172.41s -> 179.85s]  I don't have an answer for you. I don't know. Your P is like bright green.
[180.57s -> 190.60s]  I don't I don't know what that means. Answer him. I just did. I don't know. I'm not a doctor.
[193.98s -> 199.66s]  Did you plan to pour the coffee out with a truck beforehand? All right. Well, there's a lot to go
[199.66s -> 205.03s]  over. And I know a lot of people have a lot of questions. So we can just start from the beginning.
[206.57s -> 211.22s]  I got my throat so froggy right now. I guess I have been talking a lot.
[214.09s -> 223.59s]  Who? How was Santa? Who was Santa? Santa. All right. Give me a moment. Let me clear my throat.
[230.57s -> 243.05s]  When was Santa? Did you film the whole Christmas song? All right. So let's start. Let's start at
[243.05s -> 249.19s]  the very beginning. This stream had its inception about two to three years ago. I was trying to
[249.19s -> 255.78s]  find a way to do this, trying to find a way to make it so I would have this big event that just
[255.78s -> 262.84s]  would get ruined. And I feel like this was a good time to do it. It was from November 2020 based on
[262.84s -> 269.43s]  chat logs. That's another thing I was a little concerned about years ago. You know how sometimes
[269.43s -> 275.83s]  I just am in the chat, either an offline chat or post stream, pre stream. And I just kind of say
[275.83s -> 285.19s]  shit. Yeah, there are receipts. People link. Don't don't tell me no. And you don't know what I mean.
[285.75s -> 290.47s]  The amount of times that I've been linked the hamster stream, because I just write stuff in
[290.47s -> 297.91s]  pre stream. I just write stuff and whatever. Do I do it or do I not do it? So a long time ago,
[297.91s -> 303.75s]  I wrote this exact stream joke into the chat saying, oh, yeah, I was thinking about doing that.
[303.75s -> 309.83s]  Maybe it's funny. I don't know. And I finally did it. Obviously, a lot more elaborate than two or
[309.83s -> 315.24s]  three sentences in a chat room. But, you know, please, please, please do the hamster stream.
[316.10s -> 324.25s]  I don't think people would like the hamster stream. I really think people would have,
[324.89s -> 337.48s]  would be very, very uncomfortable with that. I would be uncomfortable with that. All right.
[337.48s -> 342.49s]  But yeah, this is something I've wanted to do for a long time. But I want to do it in a way,
[342.49s -> 347.75s]  too, that wasn't, you know, I know the first 10 minutes of the 15 minutes of that stream was
[348.47s -> 356.38s]  kind of fucked up. But I also didn't want to just kind of ruin the award show, because there was the
[356.38s -> 363.32s]  idea of how long should I do this for? How long does this start for? And I think after because
[363.72s -> 369.16s]  honestly, those first five to seven categories were dogshit categories. That was it was intentional
[369.16s -> 375.58s]  to be there. People were like, dude, why is worse Peter still on the list? Well, it was to buy us
[375.58s -> 384.92s]  time to do the real awards. If you would like to know a few of those early awards were just to make
[384.92s -> 390.49s]  sure that I could do the real ones on the main channel. Dude, why is worse? These these nominees
[390.49s -> 394.97s]  for worse Peter are terrible. This category is awful. Why is it even still here? Well, now you
[394.97s -> 404.68s]  know. It was filler. It was. I remember getting okay, we're getting a little ahead of ourselves
[404.68s -> 412.17s]  here. But I remember getting to the point where I think a lot of you thought that that was what it
[412.17s -> 420.52s]  was going to be the whole stream. We got about six, seven awards in. And the extinguisher was just on
[420.52s -> 426.20s]  the main channel. And I think a lot of people were like, I don't like this. What are you doing? No,
[426.20s -> 431.72s]  stop this. This I don't want to see this anymore. Please don't doll. I was looking forward to the
[431.72s -> 440.82s]  awards ruining Christmas. I saw the coffee pasta. I'm like, oh shit, people are like actually getting
[440.82s -> 453.75s]  sad. And then there was the reverse coffee pasta, which was fun, too. Yeah, that was funny. But yeah,
[453.75s -> 461.46s]  I wanted to make sure that we did the routine. And then okay, we're now we're just gonna do the
[461.46s -> 465.46s]  awards and we're gonna chill out. It's gonna be a fun cozy stream for the last hour or two,
[465.46s -> 473.16s]  whatever it was, right. So that's why I played out that way. Did you actually randomly mod people?
[473.16s -> 482.82s]  Well, how about this? No. Hey, hey, hey, the mods were in on it the whole time. The mods were in on
[482.82s -> 496.92s]  it the whole freaking time. No way. It was a fun stream. It was definitely it was definitely fun.
[496.92s -> 502.52s]  I would say that was probably I was a I was very concerned about this stream because there's a lot
[502.52s -> 509.64s]  of moving parts. I'm actually more so than maybe a lot of people think trying to do a stream where
[509.64s -> 516.12s]  you fight another stream at the same time and need to converge the two timelines together
[517.59s -> 525.03s]  with delays and, you know, live transcoding delays to each other. And it was very wait,
[525.03s -> 533.85s]  so it was a joke. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, of course not. Was it actually live? Yeah,
[533.85s -> 541.14s]  the whole thing was live. There's only one thing that wasn't live. And it's this guy.
[541.94s -> 552.73s]  This is the only thing that wasn't live. Yeah, there is. Is he okay? Bugleberry is okay.
[552.73s -> 559.70s]  Confirmed we had a conversation over the phone. I was very concerned, but no, he said he said he
[559.70s -> 567.18s]  was completely fine. He said he had a little bit of a he said his shoulder or his back kind of
[567.18s -> 576.30s]  hurt a little, but he'll be all right. How did he get out? I don't that's another question for
[576.30s -> 584.23s]  another day. I don't know. But yeah, let me put this in. So I want to ask you. Hi. Yes, I'm here.
[584.23s -> 593.48s]  I want to ask, do you do you guys want to watch the Bugleberry segment just without anything?
[593.48s -> 599.82s]  You can see like how that played out. You want to start there? Because one of the hardest things
[599.82s -> 609.91s]  of this whole entire stream was that and trying to work with Bugleberry. Somebody just went, nah,
[609.91s -> 618.15s]  not really. All right, let's let's actually let's watch it because it cut away a few times. And I
[618.15s -> 623.03s]  think during this portion is when we were mixing the streams together. So people were going to go
[623.03s -> 626.79s]  on all over the place. There was a lot of chaos. There was a lot of screaming. So do you want to
[626.79s -> 633.83s]  just kind of see how this actually played out? It was dim the lights. So this is this is the
[633.83s -> 639.27s]  actual segment. We can skip through it. We don't have to watch the entire thing. I just want to
[639.27s -> 644.01s]  say there's a few places that I just need to be seen because of how awesome I thought it was.
[646.44s -> 654.71s]  And the the BTS crew, the on the summit. Oh, they absolutely destroyed this. They killed it. It was
[654.71s -> 663.02s]  awesome. So anytime that I write up stuff, yeah, be on the summit. Beyond the Summit was the
[663.02s -> 670.02s]  production crew for the show. And it's the group that did all the camera work, all the set designing
[670.02s -> 679.35s]  and all that stuff. So they did an unbelievable stellar job. So but when you work with a production
[679.35s -> 686.14s]  company, it's really I'm so happy that there are at least a few of these companies in the space
[686.14s -> 695.51s]  that can listen to this crazy nonsense. And OK, so anytime I start a show, an idea for a show,
[695.51s -> 700.07s]  I just write a bunch of shit. I'm like, I want this and I wanted this. And here's the whole scene.
[700.07s -> 703.67s]  Here's a whole scene is going to play out. He's going to open up a portal to hell through the
[703.67s -> 706.79s]  middle of the table. And then the screams are going to come out of that. He's going like,
[706.79s -> 712.39s]  I just I just write shit. And then I clean it up and we get meetings and I kind of go line by
[712.39s -> 720.52s]  line and see, like, is this possible? Can we do this? And to hear people say, I don't know,
[720.52s -> 730.22s]  but we're going to try is actually very encouraging. So whenever I it's just so whenever
[730.22s -> 734.86s]  I get to set, right, I say this is exactly how I want it to look like. This is what I want it
[734.86s -> 742.46s]  to feel like. And then I get there and it's time to go. It's I love that. I love getting in there
[742.46s -> 746.70s]  and like directing and OK, no, I think they should be over there. Oh, what do you think? Yeah. You
[746.70s -> 750.89s]  think that's good. Yeah. How does it look in the camera? Let me take a look. I live for that.
[753.11s -> 762.58s]  Director Andy, you're a control freak. No, I'm the director. I'm the director. Dude thinks he's
[762.58s -> 774.15s]  Christopher Nolan. But creative direction is like some of my favorite shit. I did. That's why I do
[774.15s -> 784.81s]  all this stuff is because you're an aspiring film student. I'm not James Cameron. Hey, give me a
[784.81s -> 793.93s]  break. But my whole point with this is when you get a group together that are as passionate,
[793.93s -> 800.30s]  as full of passion as you are for the project, everybody just comes to work and it's like,
[800.30s -> 804.39s]  let's do this shit and make it awesome. So we'll go over some of this stuff.
[805.35s -> 816.94s]  Film student Andy. So the problem with this segment before we start, we're just because,
[816.94s -> 822.06s]  you know, we're going to watch it because it's an awesome segment. The problem with the segment
[822.06s -> 828.23s]  was trying to time talking to Bugleberry. It's going to be 10 minutes. No, we'll skip through.
[828.23s -> 838.49s]  So I don't want I'm not going to ruin the magic, but Bugleberry is here right now. Right. And I
[838.49s -> 844.52s]  had to talk to Bugleberry after, you know, Bugleberry's segment was playing. So trying
[844.52s -> 852.66s]  to time out how to talk. Don't skip. Okay. Trying to have a conversation with Bugleberry. It was
[852.66s -> 862.98s]  very hard to do. We rehearsed it like four or five times in a row. And you'll see Bugleberry,
[862.98s -> 873.51s]  what are you doing? What are you talking about? There he is. No, no, no. I'm going to do my
[873.51s -> 879.34s]  cooking segment. What are you talking about? The thing I was the most scared about was getting
[879.34s -> 883.42s]  it wrong. That's not fair. That's not fair. Gerber, you told me. For instance, during rehearsal.
[883.42s -> 890.06s]  Very specifically. You said. Watch this. Oh, Bugleberry, you can have one segment this year.
[890.06s -> 895.38s]  Oh, okay. You can do whatever you want. This is my one segment. Are you going to take this from me?
[895.38s -> 900.68s]  Yeah, I'm going to. Why exactly? Well, I think that you just have to, we're looking for you to maybe
[900.68s -> 907.24s]  help out and maybe cast a spell on the hacker's computer. And we're looking to. What did you do?
[907.24s -> 911.43s]  Oh, shit. I think I got it wrong. What did you do? Oh, I got it wrong. What websites were you on?
[911.43s -> 918.07s]  Let's look at your history. Right. If you get it wrong, if you can't cue up this conversation.
[918.07s -> 924.36s]  Is that what you did? It ruins the whole bit. Oh, okay. Which was so, that was in my brain the
[924.36s -> 932.55s]  entire time. Well, what do you want me to do? Let him cook. I don't have anything here. Okay,
[932.55s -> 937.19s]  we don't have to watch this whole thing. I don't have any of my spell books. I wonder what he would
[937.19s -> 945.54s]  have made. I came to make a holiday dinner. You told me to leave all of my things at home.
[945.54s -> 949.06s]  What was he going to cook? Don't bring the spell book. You don't need it. So it's not here. So what
[949.06s -> 956.92s]  do you want me to do? I just want to watch the, okay, I won't skip. Oh, bugleberry, bugleberry.
[956.92s -> 962.82s]  Can you please come on the show and make a turkey? Oh yeah, sure thing, German. Oh no, people that
[962.82s -> 968.02s]  are showing up right now. This is full screen. It happened again. We need bugleberry to do this again.
[968.02s -> 980.07s]  And what is this for? Is this for a hacker? Hacker, hack you? So this part in particular,
[982.30s -> 985.10s]  I remember we were sitting there trying to figure out how we were going to actually do this. I'm
[985.10s -> 990.06s]  going to do what I can, German. Just hold on, hold tight. And underneath this table,
[991.50s -> 995.80s]  which obviously we cut a few times, but under the table there were two people from BTS
[996.84s -> 1005.02s]  ready to pull all this shit down the hell portal. We had to get this right. This was one take,
[1005.02s -> 1011.02s]  by the way. We couldn't do this more than once. So what you are watching had to only happen once
[1011.02s -> 1018.66s]  because otherwise we've ruined the tablecloth. Everybody, I need you to stand back and that is
[1018.66s -> 1023.14s]  you got to one take Jacob. Sometimes stand back. Everybody watching, please be careful.
[1023.14s -> 1028.42s]  I don't know what could happen here. If we got this wrong, we would have had to get,
[1028.42s -> 1033.98s]  I would have reset, get all new tablecloth, all new everything. All the stuff has already got like
[1033.98s -> 1038.14s]  stomach catch up all over it. We would have to reset the, it would take like an hour to reset
[1038.14s -> 1049.78s]  this whole scene. So as we go here, you'll say, Oh yeah, I, I take my sweet time doing this.
[1050.42s -> 1061.14s]  I forgot. Can you feel it? Can anybody feel it? I can. You need to hold on to something.
[1064.73s -> 1068.57s]  So they're under the table. These are their hands and we blocked it out in a way.
[1071.40s -> 1081.50s]  Oh, it's so cool. We need to see it again. Hello. Oh, it was very loud, but it's all right.
[1081.50s -> 1085.26s]  So again, there are people under this table and look, this is behind the scenes.
[1085.26s -> 1089.02s]  If you don't want the magic ruined, then don't put on the director commentary stream. Okay.
[1093.11s -> 1099.19s]  This, look at how this, all this stuff perfectly goes in. This was all practical. None of that
[1099.19s -> 1107.37s]  stuff was, was none of that stuff was put in after in post or anything. We actually really did that.
[1108.87s -> 1111.99s]  I think it was probably one of my favorite things I've ever done on screen.
[1116.28s -> 1125.50s]  It was fucking perfect. And all that was, was just pre people sitting under the table
[1125.50s -> 1134.57s]  ready to pull it. And we practiced it a few times. Oh, I could watch that over and over again. I love
[1134.57s -> 1137.61s]  it.
[1140.82s -> 1141.78s]  That part too.
[1146.41s -> 1150.82s]  This is a real portal to hell. Wait, what is it?
[1155.74s -> 1156.30s]  None of this is acting.
[1171.90s -> 1177.50s]  Somebody said this before, and I'll kind of add a little bit to it. Somebody said, I used,
[1177.50s -> 1183.22s]  somebody said I hated Bugleberry until it turned out to be something that when Jerma puts the mask
[1183.22s -> 1189.45s]  on, director commentary, by the way, no spoilers, and gets to kind of do whatever he wants.
[1189.45s -> 1198.28s]  And it's almost this therapeutic acting. I, I, this is my, I love Bugleberry. I love the,
[1198.28s -> 1202.20s]  I love the, the, I love Bugleberry. I don't, I don't know anything about Bugleberry besides
[1202.20s -> 1211.98s]  the fact that I, you know, I know him. The Bugleberry arc, trying to describe the Bugleberry
[1211.98s -> 1217.32s]  arc to people is so difficult because they, they, they look at you, they're looking like I'm crazy.
[1217.32s -> 1222.58s]  It's like, oh, so what, what, why, who is, what is this? Who is this guy? Oh, I put the, I did
[1222.58s -> 1226.34s]  this thing and everybody hated it. And everybody talked about how like, please don't, please God,
[1226.34s -> 1233.13s]  don't ever do that again. Please. Like that was just not funny. It was uncomfortable and it was
[1233.13s -> 1241.62s]  embarrassing. And for Bugleberry to go where he was five years ago or so, to here, where I,
[1241.62s -> 1249.29s]  I think he's one of my favorite things on this whole channel. I love this character and people
[1249.29s -> 1253.54s]  like, wait, so people hate him? Well, yeah. I mean, unironically, a lot of people do.
[1254.47s -> 1261.06s]  Why are you doing this? I don't know. Cause I feel like it. It sounds like it sounds funny.
[1261.06s -> 1267.90s]  You got him on the third try. That's right. The hot tub stream was where I think people started
[1267.90s -> 1276.66s]  to flip on them. What? What are you talking about? I cannot put the spell back in.
[1277.38s -> 1284.18s]  The spell is here now. We need to sacrifice. Also you care about very much. I'm realizing
[1284.18s -> 1293.69s]  this right now. This does not have the audio distortion. So Bugleberry real voice leak.
[1293.69s -> 1301.46s]  How about the presence under the tree? Oh, no, no, you don't want to do those. Interesting.
[1304.20s -> 1307.80s]  No, we're not going to start. That's not happening. It has to be something that you
[1307.80s -> 1313.88s]  care about. Not something that anybody. Oh yeah. Timing that too. Cause if you time that wrong.
[1313.88s -> 1318.04s]  So let's say I didn't cue that up. There'd be question marks in chat.
[1318.04s -> 1324.70s]  It'd be like, what, why did he just say that? Not happening. It has to be something that you
[1324.70s -> 1330.47s]  care about. Pre-recorded, pre-recorded. Oh, it's a bit. Let's go get those presents.
[1331.59s -> 1335.59s]  Yes. That's what we're doing. It's the only way. It's the only way.
[1335.91s -> 1338.63s]  They come get the presents. And you saw that obviously.
[1340.87s -> 1342.63s]  There's no going back. Like I already said.
[1345.59s -> 1349.19s]  Hello. Is this a new iPhone? They get bigger every year.
[1351.94s -> 1362.17s]  I love that. Can you hear the screams? I can. What's this one? Oh, sounds like an Xbox.
[1362.17s -> 1365.77s]  I don't know why I was so obsessed with Xbox. Maybe it's not.
[1365.77s -> 1374.42s]  Oh, it hits so hard.
[1393.18s -> 1396.38s]  Wait, what was that? I didn't hear that.
[1400.94s -> 1405.02s]  Is it art? I didn't know that. I didn't even hear that.
[1415.42s -> 1418.62s]  By the way, I know a lot of people were mad hearing me say this.
[1419.58s -> 1423.42s]  I don't think this game sucks. I did it for comedic effect only.
[1432.54s -> 1433.66s]  I mean, I've never played it really.
[1448.01s -> 1455.75s]  So at this point here, the hardest part of the day besides obviously doing this routine back and
[1455.75s -> 1461.40s]  forth was how do we get everybody that's on the other channel over to the main one and have people
[1461.40s -> 1470.10s]  not miss anything? And let me tell you something about fucking ads. We had to run ads in very
[1470.10s -> 1479.29s]  specific places to get rid of pre-rolls. So if you don't know, there is a system on Twitch where
[1479.29s -> 1487.35s]  if you run ads, you disable pre-roll ads on the channel for a certain amount of time.
[1487.35s -> 1491.59s]  So if we're going to be making people go back and forth, especially during an incredibly
[1491.59s -> 1495.42s]  important part like this, well, okay, the streams are coming together. We had to make sure nobody
[1495.42s -> 1502.18s]  was going to get ads coming over back to the other channel. So trying to time, all right,
[1502.26s -> 1508.42s]  run 60 seconds of ads right here in a spot where we know because that'll turn off pre-rolls for 15
[1508.42s -> 1513.62s]  minutes and then they can come over and we can time it in a way where they won't get a pre-roll
[1513.62s -> 1527.54s]  when it was a lot. You dislike ads very much. I don't dislike ads. I dislike ads that ruin content.
[1529.42s -> 1536.15s]  That's just the way it is. And if you can, running ads in certain places,
[1536.15s -> 1541.45s]  okay, it's a BRB screen or, okay, hey, I'm going to take a quick break and people know it's coming.
[1541.45s -> 1550.66s]  People know it's happening. If you have ads run during content, it just destroys what you're
[1550.66s -> 1559.86s]  doing. It just ruins what you're doing. Ads do make sense in certain places. They do and they can,
[1559.86s -> 1569.70s]  but not for no reason in random spots. And yeah, it ruins the bit. It ruins the magic. It really does.
[1569.70s -> 1577.82s]  If I'm doing something like this and you, oh, I heard, oh, German's doing a stream. Oh, oh,
[1577.82s -> 1583.34s]  there's this thing going on. I'm going to go check it out. And we're at this portion and you get like
[1583.34s -> 1589.74s]  a 30 second pre-roll ad or like a 60 second ad or something, you're going to miss this entire routine,
[1589.74s -> 1596.95s]  the whole thing. You can turn off mid-roll ads. Oh yeah, you can, but you can't turn off pre-rolls.
[1596.95s -> 1602.12s]  Pre-rolls are there. I cannot adjust them. The only thing I can do is run
[1602.12s -> 1608.55s]  mid-rolls to make sure that there are no pre-rolls for a certain amount of time.
[1608.55s -> 1614.09s]  So, and another thing too, and I don't want to get a go kind of off on, you know,
[1614.09s -> 1621.67s]  ads and money and stuff, but I'm going to for a second. Trying to, look, if I take a BRB and
[1621.67s -> 1625.69s]  let's say that there was like three or four minutes of ads or something, that means I have
[1625.69s -> 1630.60s]  to take a three or four minute break. That means I have to. That means I need to figure out a way
[1630.60s -> 1636.30s]  to do it. And if I'm in the middle of something and it's like, oh shit, I know that there are ads
[1636.30s -> 1641.29s]  that are going to be ran here for two or three minutes. Oh, okay. I'll stop what I'm doing to
[1641.29s -> 1647.19s]  make sure I don't ruin the content. You know what I'm saying? Two minutes of ads, a minute of ads,
[1647.19s -> 1654.62s]  three minutes of ads, five minutes of ads, which is why, and I'll be very honest, I'm not, I'm not
[1654.62s -> 1659.26s]  going to do any of that. I'm just not, I fucking hate it. I hate doing that. I hate fucking up
[1659.26s -> 1671.48s]  people's viewing experiences. Now, I also do very specific kinds of content like this. And that's
[1671.48s -> 1674.60s]  why I have such a strong opinion on ads, is because if I'm doing something like this and
[1674.60s -> 1680.71s]  somebody misses it for some reason, it annoys me. But I do something, I'm not, this type of shit is
[1680.71s -> 1687.19s]  where I don't want ads, but sometimes you can't avoid them. But anyways, I'm kind of going off on
[1687.19s -> 1694.63s]  a tangent here, but you are not, I'm not, let me just be very honest and tell you what's happening.
[1694.63s -> 1699.19s]  And I've said this before and I'll say it again. I'm not going to ever take one of those incentive
[1699.19s -> 1704.78s]  things, ever. It's not, it just won't happen. I can't do it. Because even if it would be a shit
[1704.78s -> 1710.22s]  load of, of, of money or something, I just, I don't want to do it. I just, I, I think of
[1710.22s -> 1716.63s]  me sitting in the chair and watching a bunch of ads and it's like, oh, but this sucks because I
[1716.63s -> 1721.11s]  missed, I literally missed this because there was a two minutes of ads in the middle of this.
[1722.41s -> 1726.01s]  Or there was like, oh, I had a pre-roll or something. It, I just hate it. I really do.
[1726.25s -> 1754.01s]  I like that part. Oh, is that a callback? Is that a callback to the pottery stream? I think so.
[1754.57s -> 1760.20s]  Oh boy. Hey, remind me to never do that again.
[1761.80s -> 1768.09s]  Actually, hold on a second. Oh, the lighting. The best part is this is practical effect lighting,
[1768.81s -> 1776.17s]  haunted house style. Cause remember Bugleberry is a Halloween character. Having the cool haunted
[1776.17s -> 1788.89s]  house type lights is what we need. Can you feel it? I can't. What do you mean?
[1789.37s -> 1794.58s]  Just a dude doing a flashlight on and off. I mean, it's a bigger, it's a bigger than that.
[1796.18s -> 1804.33s]  And you just direct the movie already. No, no, because movies are, are way more expensive than
[1804.33s -> 1819.14s]  this. They're way too expensive. You should just crowd fund it. No, because what if it sucks?
[1823.91s -> 1829.19s]  Do you really want me to do, all right, man, here it comes. Kickstarter or something for my new
[1829.19s -> 1835.67s]  movie. The new movie. Bugleberry's haunted hayride or whatever, whatever the hell it would be. I
[1835.67s -> 1843.16s]  don't know. A Jermis movie. Oh yeah. I need to make, yeah. I need to raise a two and a half million
[1843.16s -> 1850.07s]  dollars, five million dollars to do this. And I do it and the movie is dog shit. I don't, I would,
[1850.07s -> 1856.49s]  I don't know. It would keep me up at night forever. It would keep me up at night forever.
[1856.49s -> 1862.38s]  Stuff like this is just, I'm going to do it. And if I can get it paid for, cool. If not, then I'm
[1862.38s -> 1869.78s]  going to have to figure that out. But I don't know if I could take on like a large multimillion
[1869.78s -> 1878.18s]  dollar movie project and have it be terrible and ruin everything in my whole life. Oh yeah, dude,
[1878.18s -> 1886.49s]  you still owe, you know, $475,000 to this vendor. Oh, you went over budget. Hey guys. Can we do a
[1886.49s -> 1891.21s]  second Kickstarter? This is the Kickstarter to pay for all the over budget. I know the movie sucked
[1891.21s -> 1898.74s]  and you all hate me now, but can I have another 500 grand? I don't know. It would have to be
[1898.74s -> 1916.04s]  something very specific. Do a, do a subathon? No. You go into real debt. Yeah. Just do super low
[1916.04s -> 1925.72s]  budget stuff. It works. Just look at this. The, all right. The thing is though, the only reason
[1925.72s -> 1932.39s]  why this happens is because I think of something that I think would be funny. And then we go,
[1932.39s -> 1937.85s]  okay, how do I develop that? I don't just, I don't want to work in reverse. Working in reverse,
[1937.85s -> 1944.78s]  I think is a problem where instead of having something that I want to do first, it's, oh,
[1944.78s -> 1950.41s]  let's make a movie. Okay. What's the movie? If I had something that I wanted to make into a movie,
[1950.41s -> 1956.98s]  then yeah, but I don't want to work backwards. Everything you've ever seen on this channel that
[1956.98s -> 1970.81s]  took more than a few weeks to make, it was never working backwards. You just confirmed the movie.
[1970.81s -> 1979.11s]  I did not. And sure has there been random things where I've said, but yeah, but how do you make
[1979.11s -> 1985.83s]  that right now? I'm focused on some of this, turning some of these live ideas into reality.
[1985.83s -> 1991.75s]  And that's it. I don't know. I have no idea what, what the future is. You want power,
[1991.75s -> 1999.91s]  you want magical mystery. I'll give it to you. But there, these are natural. The reason why I
[1999.91s -> 2010.97s]  think a lot of people go, Oh wow, that was fun. I say, I say it's an iPhone. Wait, hold on.
[2011.13s -> 2014.49s]  That was way too big for an iPhone.
[2024.86s -> 2026.86s]  Oh, that part is so cool.
[2032.12s -> 2034.12s]  Cool iPhones for Christmas.
[2044.31s -> 2046.31s]  I don't want to go visit my grandmother.
[2048.55s -> 2058.68s]  All practical. Yeah, come on. Oh, come on. That wasn't all practical. Yeah, sorry. There wasn't
[2058.68s -> 2070.49s]  real fire under the table. That is the Fugleberry segment. I think we have, there's a lot of photos
[2070.49s -> 2077.98s]  too. Some of these you're going to very much enjoy. For instance, here are the, I'll come back for
[2077.98s -> 2085.43s]  this. Hi. So the, we took a bunch of these photos for his, and I, I, it's sad that I didn't have
[2085.43s -> 2091.82s]  that on. I wasn't wearing that during the actual shoot, but just kind of figured it would fall off
[2091.82s -> 2096.31s]  and get in the way. Especially during some of the stuff where I had to put my hand down and I didn't
[2096.31s -> 2112.79s]  want to get caught on it or anything. So Chef Fugleberry, seeing this face in 4k is, is horrifying.
[2112.79s -> 2121.19s]  Here's some of the BTS guys helping me put the hat on. Chef, please do actual Chef Fugleberry.
[2121.19s -> 2131.24s]  Yeah, like why would he do that though, right? Some of my favorite parts of Fugleberry's character
[2131.24s -> 2136.98s]  and just kind of going back and forth with Fugleberry is what is he doing here? Like why,
[2136.98s -> 2147.19s]  what, what is my relationship to Fugleberry? What is it? Why is he here? That, I, like,
[2148.15s -> 2157.21s]  am I, are we related? No, I hired him to do the scary stuff, but we've now become this,
[2157.77s -> 2164.23s]  oh yeah, Fugleberry is just going to be there. Why? And why would he do it? I don't know. It,
[2164.23s -> 2176.65s]  it just, it, I love it. I like that. This is one of my favorite photos. So yeah, this is the,
[2176.65s -> 2182.17s]  I believe this is the day, one of the rehearsals where I think we were all trying to figure out
[2182.17s -> 2192.57s]  how exactly we were going to pull this thing through. Don't typecast Fugleberry.
[2192.57s -> 2196.17s]  That's the, that was the whole point of having him show up. That whole point of having Fugleberry
[2196.17s -> 2200.97s]  show up is he, I, he wasn't typecasted this time, but he ended up having to be typecasted.
[2200.97s -> 2214.84s]  Think about that one. All right, so this is me obviously doing an impression of Fugleberry.
[2214.84s -> 2221.08s]  I'm just doing an impression of that, of that person. I figured, I was here a little,
[2221.08s -> 2225.88s]  I was here early, so they let me kind of come in and, you know, pretend like I was
[2225.88s -> 2239.02s]  doing whatever Fugleberry was going to do. See under here? That's all that was.
[2241.59s -> 2255.64s]  That's what that was. Fake magic. Every time I see that, the, the air in this room when we
[2255.64s -> 2263.59s]  nailed it first try was, we, we essentially, we, we cut the cameras not long after that
[2263.59s -> 2268.55s]  and we watched it back and we were all just sitting there going, that was fucking perfect.
[2269.03s -> 2275.54s]  That was perfect. We didn't, we're not going to do that again. That's worst impression 2022.
[2275.54s -> 2287.90s]  Get out of here. Stop ruining my immersion. Hey, this says behind the scenes of the Christmas show.
[2290.68s -> 2298.09s]  This is, you're listening to the commentary track. So yeah, that was that.
[2300.33s -> 2304.49s]  There he is. See, he showed up a little later, but you can see the setup here.
[2305.13s -> 2310.14s]  These were the lights that they were flickering and they also, we had these under here to kind
[2310.14s -> 2319.30s]  of turn them on a little higher. Why is Fugleberry wearing your sweater? I don't know. Maybe he was
[2319.30s -> 2329.19s]  fucking cold or something. And he was like, can I borrow your sweater? How come there's no picture
[2329.19s -> 2339.75s]  of you with him? We haven't seen all the behind the scenes yet. This is, this is just so, it's
[2339.75s -> 2348.95s]  so weird to look at this. Like why is he in, why is he here? Worst Boston moment. That category's
[2348.95s -> 2355.42s]  not coming back. That was a filler category for this year. Is there a penis on the wall?
[2355.42s -> 2363.85s]  There's no penis on the wall. Yeah, I know this camera is fucked up. Whatever. 15 minutes on
[2363.85s -> 2368.81s]  Friday. So here's, here's part of the rehearsal with Santa, who the, that real Santa, that real
[2368.81s -> 2375.70s]  Santa was amazing. Took direction incredibly well. Was super funny. Just an absolute pro.
[2376.95s -> 2382.54s]  Just a comp, just an absolute complete pro. And we're obviously just kind of going over
[2382.54s -> 2388.30s]  how it's going to be and minimum one hour lunch. We'll hash it out. I'm actually sorry.
[2396.78s -> 2405.82s]  Did you sit on his lap? No. Because okay, it was like, what, what, what do I want to do when he's
[2405.82s -> 2425.21s]  in here? And no, you should have. It's literally Santa. Yeah. Why are your thighs so big? What is
[2425.21s -> 2436.79s]  going on? Why do I have such huge thighs? What is, this is unedited. This is unedited. What is
[2436.79s -> 2443.77s]  going on? No, no, this is something weird here. I think it's because my pockets were full of stuff.
[2444.49s -> 2449.53s]  No. All right. This is what's happening. This is what's happening. In each one of these pockets
[2449.53s -> 2456.10s]  is a microphone holder. We were doing audio testing and these pants were a little tight.
[2456.10s -> 2462.66s]  They were a little tight if I remember. So there was two huge things. I had like my phone. I had
[2463.22s -> 2473.29s]  a mic pack. I had an audio pack and it was inflating my hips. That does look crazy.
[2475.99s -> 2486.38s]  That looks so fucked up. Oh my God. I feel like there's another, I feel like there's a body
[2486.38s -> 2492.38s]  going back and another pair of legs. Like this is a centaur. You know what I'm saying? Like there's
[2492.38s -> 2503.10s]  a back this way and legs here. Holy shit. What's happening? All right. Anyways, behind the scenes
[2503.10s -> 2508.65s]  that was Santa Santa. We, we only had Santa for a little while. So we had to really nail that,
[2508.65s -> 2517.02s]  which a lot of the stuff really just, there was so much stress and anxiety on getting to these
[2517.02s -> 2522.84s]  points correctly. Every meeting we had, every time we were sitting here on the, on the deck,
[2522.84s -> 2526.68s]  which is essentially a stage kind of going over where people are going to be standing and how it's
[2526.68s -> 2532.28s]  going to play out. Okay. In the back of everybody's mind, it's, are we actually going to be able to do
[2532.28s -> 2541.90s]  this? I don't know, but we're going to find out really soon. And I think that's what I,
[2541.90s -> 2553.34s]  that's what I like the most is, is this going to work? Will it actually make sense? I think it's,
[2553.34s -> 2565.21s]  it's challenging in a way. Pixar mom. Well, it's a live show. So yeah. Yeah. It's a live show with a
[2565.21s -> 2570.92s]  lot of stuff happening. Stop talking about his thighs. All right. I'm going to move on from this.
[2571.64s -> 2576.74s]  This one better not be worse. So this is practicing the bugleberry segment,
[2576.74s -> 2580.50s]  which was, we did this probably five times over the course of a few days.
[2580.50s -> 2590.26s]  The channel, the channel was hacked. I'll make it up to you. We need some help. I need, we have
[2590.26s -> 2598.68s]  engineers here doing all kinds of shit. It's not there. Yeah. So that's this rehearsal.
[2600.26s -> 2610.30s]  Who played bugleberry? A mystery, a mystery actor, mystery actor. What do you mean actor?
[2610.94s -> 2617.53s]  Who played, what do you mean? Yeah. Let's go back a little further. What do you mean?
[2618.10s -> 2628.49s]  The real person. What do you mean actor? But yeah, that's some video footage. There's a picture or
[2628.49s -> 2639.75s]  two. This is weird to look at. This is just a kind of a view of the whole set. So originally I was
[2639.75s -> 2645.26s]  going to walk behind the tree and destroy the tree in the beginning. You know, in the beginning where
[2645.26s -> 2648.30s]  I'm kind of yelling at everybody, I'm telling everybody to shut up. One of the, originally it
[2648.30s -> 2653.02s]  was like, I want to go back here and I want to pull the fucking tree down and walk back and get
[2653.02s -> 2657.94s]  backstage here. But turned out it's probably a dangerous thing to do.
[2659.29s -> 2662.81s]  Pulling a tree down like that, connected to a bunch of wires. It was just, it was like,
[2662.81s -> 2667.21s]  eh, we probably shouldn't do that. That would have been probably pretty bad. So we decided not to do
[2667.21s -> 2674.86s]  it. Somebody in this building did. Now this is the rehearsal for this. Otherwise you and I had done,
[2674.86s -> 2687.80s]  by the way, this was made for us. Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, hey. People's heads like high heels.
[2687.80s -> 2693.11s]  Otherwise you and I had done, by the way, this was made for us.
[2693.11s -> 2700.42s]  The strut. So people were asking if I was supposed to throw the coffee in Atriox's face.
[2700.42s -> 2705.78s]  And I decided not to. No, I wanted just to dump it on the ground without even mentioning it because
[2706.79s -> 2711.53s]  what a fucking piece of shit. Like this is just, I'm just going to dump this because it's not the
[2711.53s -> 2715.85s]  way that I wanted it. And I can already tell that by looking at it. So I'm just dumping it on the
[2715.85s -> 2721.19s]  ground and someone's going to clean that up for me. But no, it wasn't because I didn't want to
[2721.19s -> 2728.23s]  throw it. Actually, Atriox actually did say, hey, dude, throw that coffee in my face if you want.
[2728.23s -> 2731.51s]  I'm just like, ah, do you want to do it? He's like, yeah, dude, if you want to throw it in my face,
[2731.51s -> 2737.78s]  just throw the coffee directly in my face. And we decided against it because he had to show up a
[2737.78s -> 2748.60s]  little later, obviously, for the 1v1. But we also, if you look at how it played out,
[2752.44s -> 2757.54s]  well, it doesn't show it here. But the scary part was because the person that's back here
[2757.78s -> 2765.22s]  with a huge camera and the concern was dumping it on the ground right here because this,
[2765.22s -> 2768.82s]  the cameraman follows me through when we were blocking this whole thing out.
[2768.82s -> 2772.92s]  All right, you're going to follow me through here. We're going to go this way. And being in this
[2772.92s -> 2779.86s]  position where the cameraman had like 40 pound camera, this was dangerous walking through that.
[2779.86s -> 2784.18s]  So what we had to do is I had to make sure that I dumped it kind of over almost in this doorway,
[2784.18s -> 2791.80s]  like back here. So he could walk through it without having to be scared of tripping.
[2791.80s -> 2800.28s]  This is a pose. This is a pose. Stop. Stop it. This is a pose. I'm not getting any height from
[2800.28s -> 2808.62s]  this. It's the pose. This is a pose. All right, let's prove it in real time.
[2811.82s -> 2817.90s]  Okay, still doing it. Still doing it. Where's the height? Where's the height change? There is no
[2817.90s -> 2826.70s]  height change. It's exactly the same. Exactly the same. Proving that it is a pose again once
[2826.70s -> 2831.74s]  and for all. There is no change in height from here to here. It's exactly the same.
[2844.39s -> 2850.39s]  Somebody said, I, before going to look for these two, I go, where's Ludwig? I need to talk to him.
[2850.39s -> 2853.91s]  And then I finally run into him and I just go, I don't want to talk to you. Get out of here. Go
[2853.91s -> 2864.81s]  clean that up. I was like, well, I, that's who I was looking for. Oh, here's the, uh, here's the
[2864.81s -> 2873.21s]  toast. I know it's, I mean, whatever. It's a thing. So before every show, yeah, I got caught on the
[2873.21s -> 2881.24s]  hot mic. I got caught on the hot mic. Whatever. So before every show, if people want to do it,
[2881.24s -> 2886.62s]  we do a toast. And it's, you know, it's like, if you, if you don't, if you don't drink, if you
[2886.62s -> 2889.82s]  don't feel like, if you don't want to, obviously if you have stuff going on later, don't, you know,
[2889.82s -> 2895.26s]  don't be drinking and shit, right? So you don't have to, but we do this thing. Everybody takes
[2895.26s -> 2900.79s]  a shot of whatever we have, whatever anybody wants. And we go, let's do it. People say a few
[2900.79s -> 2911.22s]  words. It's a nice way to kind of just be like, let's go for it. Alcohol Andy. What is in here?
[2911.22s -> 2918.44s]  I think that they had, I want to say this was Jim Bean or Jack Daniel. It was, it was, I think it
[2918.44s -> 2929.58s]  was Jim Bean. What did you drink? I think it was just Jim Bean. But yeah, I, the, the point is not
[2929.58s -> 2935.42s]  with this, the point is not to, oh, everybody, let's get drunk. That's not the point. It's just
[2935.42s -> 2941.62s]  a kind of a, it's like a toast at a wedding, right? Except it's not a wedding. Did you do the cat
[2941.62s -> 2952.92s]  puke sound? This is theater kids simulator. Um, theater kid. What are you, what, theater kids
[2952.92s -> 2957.69s]  backstage? What are you talking, drinking? What are you talking about? What the hell do you mean?
[2960.12s -> 2968.31s]  I am an adult. Your feet aren't on camera. You're on your tippy toes. All right. I banned that person
[2968.31s -> 2973.13s]  actually for an hour. I want that person timed up for one full hour and then reduce that by,
[2973.13s -> 2978.06s]  by 50 minutes. I want them timed up for 10 minutes. Time the person up for 10 minutes.
[2982.62s -> 2988.76s]  But yeah, it's, it's just something to do. It's something to, it's so funny how I treat a lot of
[2988.76s -> 2998.55s]  these events. It's important that everyone has fun. That's one of the most important things.
[2998.55s -> 3004.98s]  So if everyone's here having a good time, it's treated like a fun get together in a way. Everyone
[3004.98s -> 3013.40s]  just has more fun and everybody cares more about it. So I like doing that kind of stuff. So it's
[3013.40s -> 3018.20s]  not just like, okay, you're everybody, you do your job. You do your job. Stop. Okay. You, you're
[3018.20s -> 3021.56s]  going to talk to me only when, when we're going to talk about work stuff and you're going to show
[3021.56s -> 3025.24s]  up here and then, okay. And then we'll talk maybe for five seconds and you'll never see me ever
[3025.24s -> 3031.32s]  again. No, I would rather do it and have everybody essentially treat it like it's a time where we're
[3031.32s -> 3036.66s]  getting together and have a fun time. They're not visible. Again, time that person up for one
[3036.66s -> 3051.45s]  minute diminishing returns. So this is the end. It was so good. I was blown away by how unbelievable
[3051.45s -> 3056.33s]  top shelf vocalist. Can we just give a round of applause for a second? That was so, that was
[3056.33s -> 3069.85s]  unbelievable. Four people, right? Four. They just, it just sounded like a whole chorus of like 15
[3069.85s -> 3079.21s]  people. It was so good. See you later. I felt so bad too, because when we were going over rehearsals
[3079.21s -> 3085.11s]  and like directing, what's going to happen. Okay. So directing, right? Directing. So it's like,
[3085.11s -> 3089.19s]  okay, well I, what I want to happen here is this is what's going to happen. This is how it plays
[3089.19s -> 3092.95s]  out. We're going to be standing here. And what I want is, you know, you're going to be singing
[3092.95s -> 3100.12s]  and then I'm going to join you and we're going to get cut off. And cutting off a very talented
[3100.12s -> 3108.66s]  singing group within 10 seconds of their first song is just that, that sucks. And we wanted to
[3108.66s -> 3113.14s]  make sure that they had a very good amount of screen time to get a full kind of five minutes
[3113.14s -> 3120.71s]  on camera doing a few songs. It was evil. Yeah. But I thought it was fun. And they were super,
[3120.71s -> 3129.30s]  super into it too. They were so fun to work with. They got it immediately. All the elves here too.
[3129.30s -> 3136.41s]  Oh, the cookies. Right. Oh, Bugleberry. Yeah. This is, this is literally the lap. I think the
[3136.41s -> 3142.95s]  camera was off at this point. Look at how tall everybody is. All right. Can we go over this?
[3142.95s -> 3151.59s]  Look at how tall all the off-brand guys are. They're gigantic. They're so, look at how tall
[3151.59s -> 3158.42s]  they are. They're towering over everybody. Come on. Everyone talked about, wow, dude,
[3158.42s -> 3169.59s]  Santa was so much. Santa was like six, five, six, six. He was a very tall man. See you later.
[3169.59s -> 3179.99s]  That was the end. Oh, a dog that, uh, BTS had just kind of dogs hanging out. They were, uh,
[3179.99s -> 3189.38s]  people would bring their dogs to work, which was, it was so cute. Good dog. It's a presence.
[3190.26s -> 3201.10s]  This is just, we're taking pictures of stuff just to remember it. Oh, audio equipment. I think these
[3201.10s -> 3206.71s]  pictures just show how much thought went into what, because this was just a set. Nothing here did
[3206.71s -> 3216.90s]  anything. Nothing. All of this stuff was just to make it look like this was a room that was a
[3216.90s -> 3224.87s]  behind the scenes room. There's nothing here is like connected to anything. Oh, that's a good
[3224.87s -> 3232.50s]  picture. That's a Christmas card. And these two were connected to each other. So they were just
[3232.50s -> 3251.22s]  part of the set. Holy jolly Christmas. Oh, there he is. There's the, the coming into the clutch.
[3251.22s -> 3267.70s]  That thing was actually full of toys. That was a full bag of toys. That's a great photo too.
[3267.70s -> 3277.58s]  Now here's the beginning. Yeah, there is the hacker. Well, we'll go back for a second here.
[3278.14s -> 3284.20s]  So in the very beginning of this stream, I think people were saying, what's wrong with him?
[3284.20s -> 3296.52s]  Why is he acting so off? It's like trying to do that overly kind of that overly positive atmosphere.
[3296.52s -> 3302.52s]  But in like a really off putting way, somebody said, dude, you look like you made out of wax
[3302.52s -> 3306.28s]  and stuff. Like this is, this was scary. People said this was scary. The way that I was like
[3306.28s -> 3319.77s]  acting and talking the first like 20 minutes of the stream, you were acting like Ellen. It was very
[3319.77s -> 3340.86s]  off putting. Good. That's what I wanted. Do you have make? Yeah. I have a bunch of makeup on too.
[3340.86s -> 3358.57s]  These look like stock photos. He was awesome. Here's the real production room. Not the fake
[3358.57s -> 3362.49s]  one that you saw already. This is the real production room. This is where they were all
[3363.05s -> 3368.09s]  adjusting things, pumping in the videos, getting things ready, adjusting, switching cameras. This
[3368.09s -> 3376.57s]  is the actual set. This is the, yeah, this is the NASA set. This is the real one landing crew.
[3376.57s -> 3386.70s]  You should have used this. Well, I mean, no, I can't because the whole point of that fake production
[3386.70s -> 3403.30s]  room, I mean, look, you're on whatever XQC six consoles. Anyways, when you're gonna do a moon
[3403.30s -> 3407.86s]  landing stream, that actually would be kind of funny to have a huge set up like this with like
[3407.86s -> 3415.48s]  a hundred monitors. And it's me going into space and just a bunch of shit goes wrong. And there's
[3415.48s -> 3431.37s]  a whole room of like 50 people issuing me commands and stuff. Do it. I don't know. Space station
[3431.37s -> 3444.81s]  stream. How would you even do that? I don't know. How did we do this? Just figure it out.
[3444.81s -> 3450.31s]  Yeah. So again, this is the fake room. We had the two engineers here. Those were, those were just
[3450.31s -> 3466.73s]  actors. They just sat there just typing the whole day. Who the fuck are you? Oh, that's right.
[3466.73s -> 3472.44s]  I love it. So this is, we're going over kind of the, how the day is. So this is, this is probably
[3473.08s -> 3479.69s]  15 to 20 minutes before the stream, maybe like 30 minutes before the stream. And we're going over,
[3479.69s -> 3484.57s]  just because a lot of people showed up for the day. You're, he's short. I'm a very, all right,
[3484.57s -> 3492.28s]  you know what? Time out that word. There's no pose here. Look, there's no pose. All right. I'm
[3492.28s -> 3501.19s]  not going to address it anymore. Do you know how tall people really are? Good. You know what? I'm
[3501.19s -> 3514.36s]  a little bit smaller. Who gives a shit? You know how fucking strong I am and how tough I am?
[3514.36s -> 3522.57s]  Anyways, a lot of people showed up the day out. So trying to get everybody up to speed that wasn't
[3522.57s -> 3527.37s]  around for the last four or five days of setting up all this stuff. So kind of have to give the
[3527.37s -> 3545.88s]  overview of exactly what's happening for the day. Extinguisher exposed. He was, he's in this photo.
[3545.88s -> 3555.86s]  How did he do that? So to me, this is, the show's over, right? And it's just like, oh, thank God.
[3558.10s -> 3570.82s]  To me, that's like a, oh, it's done. Everybody working. Here are the elves just hanging out,
[3570.82s -> 3590.46s]  preparing for the day. They were awesome too. Every single one of them was just kind of,
[3590.46s -> 3596.87s]  when we did the breakdown. Oh, look, Doug. When we did the breakdown, it's just, okay, so you're
[3596.87s -> 3600.95s]  going to do a puzzle, but you don't actually have to. You can kind of do whatever you want in here.
[3600.95s -> 3606.79s]  I probably shouldn't have said that. I probably shouldn't have said, oh, you can just do whatever
[3606.79s -> 3612.23s]  you want. Don't even do the puzzle if you don't care. It actually made it way funnier, I think.
[3612.23s -> 3617.93s]  When I, when we checked in halfway through the stream and there was, it was just pieces on the
[3617.93s -> 3626.07s]  ground and they were just sitting at the table. What was the purpose of the elves to do the puzzle?
[3626.63s -> 3634.57s]  And we were going to check in on them and see their progress. It's just pieces dumped on the
[3634.57s -> 3642.23s]  ground. To be fair though, let's be very fair. That picture, I don't know if we can see it,
[3642.23s -> 3649.10s]  the picture that they were doing was that promotional picture from about four or five
[3649.10s -> 3657.93s]  days before the show. Almost every piece is the same color. I think it was actually impossible.
[3657.93s -> 3663.93s]  Look at just this one because it's actually pretty hard to find or buy a puzzle that's 10,000 plus
[3663.93s -> 3673.29s]  pieces. So these are four individual two or 3000 piece puzzles each. So it's just a quadrant of
[3673.29s -> 3680.94s]  the image and they were supposed to put it together. So how do you even do this part?
[3680.94s -> 3687.11s]  Because this part just is this part. It's just a image of lights. How would you ever do it?
[3687.11s -> 3693.27s]  Impossible. Even getting a border would be impossible. I think at one point we would like,
[3693.27s -> 3700.22s]  we just kind of like, oh, is it really hard? Just try to do the face. The face, this section is the
[3700.22s -> 3709.02s]  same color as all this. It's just the same thing. Every piece was like red or orange. I don't know.
[3709.02s -> 3720.09s]  I just want to see what would happen. You have a fucked up brain, man. Yeah, well, is that right?
[3720.09s -> 3730.65s]  We'll have fun here. You have a fucked up brain. So this was the camera op and this, he wasn't
[3730.65s -> 3736.41s]  supposed to do this. He came up to me and was like, hey, do we have any extra elf costumes?
[3736.41s -> 3742.87s]  I'm like, ah, I think so. Maybe. Let's find out. He's like, I just kind of want to wear one. So I
[3742.87s -> 3749.21s]  make sure I'm in the shots dressed like this. I was like, all right, that's perfect. That's a great
[3749.21s -> 3760.22s]  idea. Go for it. But look at that thing. Look at this camera. That's why we were concerned about
[3760.22s -> 3770.09s]  putting the Dump in the Coffee directly on the ground, because that's scary. Oh, look, an elf.
[3770.09s -> 3778.66s]  I love that rig so much. This was elaborate. This was spring loaded. I swear when he was
[3778.66s -> 3786.55s]  walking around, it was like, he was like a robot. This thing was like compressed air and spring
[3786.55s -> 3794.71s]  loaded. It was crazy. Oh, look at that. I don't think we're gonna, you know, I didn't think we're
[3794.71s -> 3804.15s]  gonna put in the wholesome Ludwig hug. Come on. Which the off-brand was awesome. And when I
[3804.15s -> 3808.52s]  originally trying to pitch the show around to a production company or a group that wanted to
[3808.52s -> 3815.62s]  tackle it, it was, all right, who has time? Who wants to try it? Who wants to go for it?
[3815.62s -> 3820.63s]  And off-brand, they were just like, let's do it. And it was a really short time frame, too.
[3821.93s -> 3829.16s]  Um, I kind of got the urge really, because this show, I wrote all this stuff probably
[3829.16s -> 3836.74s]  a year and a half ago, two years ago. Didn't ever do it. I swear to God, this show sat as a
[3836.74s -> 3844.66s]  document in a folder of just a few, like three or four pages of just shit that I just let sit there.
[3844.66s -> 3851.54s]  And I finally was like, you know what? I'm doing it this year. I want to do it. So, uh, talking to
[3851.54s -> 3861.53s]  off-brand to try to get it off the ground was just, they were so into it immediately. And I
[3861.53s -> 3868.46s]  believe it was like the last week of October where I was like, hey, I want to put together a whole
[3868.46s -> 3873.91s]  elaborate Christmas streamer. A bunch of crazy shit happens. And here's, here's the, here's the
[3873.91s -> 3879.27s]  script and here's all the stuff. Here's the, here it is. And they were just like, what the fuck?
[3879.27s -> 3887.34s]  Holy shit, dude. All right. Um, yeah, let's go for it. And we banged this project out in one month.
[3887.34s -> 3897.64s]  It was one month, maybe even less than that. So they didn't know they did a hell of a job.
[3897.64s -> 3914.41s]  Oh, of course there's more elves. Engineer. It's like the, it's like the creep. Like I just looked
[3914.41s -> 3930.23s]  like creepy. Wow. This is scary. I don't like this photo. Holy shit. This is right at the turn.
[3930.23s -> 3956.57s]  Oh, do I have gray hair? This photo is actually pretty scary. Uh-oh. Mask coming off. And this
[3956.57s -> 3964.50s]  also too. What is wrong with you if you were to do something like this? Oh, I'm going to join in too.
[3964.50s -> 3975.14s]  What do you, sit down, you idiot. Sit down. You're not doing that. You hire a group to come and do
[3975.14s -> 3982.95s]  this and then you're just going to be part of the group and sing with them. This is the kind of shit
[3982.95s -> 3987.19s]  that if you're at like a company meeting or like a company party, and that's where a lot of the,
[3987.19s -> 3992.86s]  a lot of the ideas that I had for the show were from that kind of thing. Like company party,
[3992.86s -> 3999.48s]  where the CEO gets up there and tries to kind of act like, um, yeah, it's, well, I'm, I'm,
[3999.48s -> 4004.44s]  I'm one of the workers and I'm super smart and I'm super funny and I'm very talented
[4004.44s -> 4010.60s]  and I'm going to show you and everybody here loves and respects me. That was the vibe. So why,
[4010.60s -> 4018.01s]  what are you, what are you doing up there? It was just so painful and a lot of people,
[4018.01s -> 4023.29s]  I'm looking back, I've seen a lot of clips and stuff and a lot of uploads and highlights and,
[4023.85s -> 4035.83s]  and comments. It feels being like this part, I hated more than anything. This is the worst part.
[4047.34s -> 4056.44s]  Michael Scott type beat. I was just going for, because you got to let people do what they're
[4056.44s -> 4065.03s]  good at. And I think a lot of this stream was let people do what they're good at and don't
[4065.03s -> 4069.35s]  implant and insert yourself into other people doing interesting things, I think.
[4078.70s -> 4087.11s]  Super in character. He's ready, he's reading, he's getting ready, getting ready for me to grab him.
[4087.11s -> 4099.78s]  Why do you look so mad? Did you watch the stream? You see what happened? Do you have any idea what
[4099.78s -> 4122.36s]  happened to me that day? Still got it. Still got it. He was furious. He's still mad. By the way,
[4122.36s -> 4129.06s]  do you see what this says? I think this says late night with Ludwig. I believe that's what
[4129.06s -> 4137.42s]  that actually says. So by the way, this is actually the run of show. So what a run of show is. So a
[4137.42s -> 4143.08s]  couple of weeks before we would get into meetings for an hour or two every couple of days, I'd say,
[4143.08s -> 4150.47s]  and we go over point by point exactly what is going to happen at every moment of the show.
[4150.47s -> 4157.59s]  And when you get one of these, you need to stick to it. Otherwise, it can really go off the rails
[4157.59s -> 4163.21s]  when people just don't know what's happening next. So if you change a run of show, you have to make
[4163.21s -> 4169.93s]  sure that everybody knows you're changing it. And we did. We actually changed the run of show.
[4169.93s -> 4176.58s]  We were not supposed to do the we were not supposed to stay with the awards. We're supposed to go all
[4176.58s -> 4182.62s]  the way through, I believe, like 12, 13, 14 awards before we did the merge. So we essentially I
[4182.62s -> 4186.82s]  thought that was going to be too long because as we were doing the first 20, 30 minutes,
[4186.82s -> 4190.90s]  it was it was becoming pretty clear that I was I want this to go a little faster.
[4190.90s -> 4197.93s]  I want to merge sooner. So we kind of copy and paste. Oh, shit, sorry. We copy and pasted.
[4198.49s -> 4202.57s]  This is during the show, by the way. This is during one of the BRBs. It was like we
[4202.57s -> 4208.81s]  took the parts that happened before the merge and just moved them forward so we could get right to
[4208.81s -> 4214.68s]  it. I didn't want people to stick around because when it became pretty clear that people were
[4214.68s -> 4220.65s]  actually thinking that this is what the joke was and that was it. I was like, oh, this channel is
[4220.65s -> 4227.30s]  compromised and he's on this other channel just doing the awards. All right, that's kind of funny,
[4227.30s -> 4231.62s]  but like, it's like, I don't know. I'm out of here. So we wanted to make sure that we got through that
[4231.62s -> 4240.92s]  faster. You got to go sometimes. But I think it was right at that perfect time period where people
[4240.92s -> 4248.95s]  started to go, what the fuck, dude? Please. So we just moved it immediately. Were you afraid of
[4248.95s -> 4255.80s]  people reporting the channel? Yes. And for weeks we talked to Twitch to tell them this was happening.
[4255.80s -> 4262.68s]  Hey, Twitch, this is happening. This is not real. And they had to, I mean, because obviously they
[4262.68s -> 4266.12s]  had to know. If they didn't know, then that would, I'm sure the channel probably would get turned
[4266.12s -> 4283.27s]  off pretty quickly. No, this is the puzzle. Do you see, oh, by the way, behind here, this is the snow,
[4283.27s -> 4292.47s]  the snow part. How did you merge the streams? So, I mean, German985, this channel was just live
[4293.11s -> 4302.94s]  and we've raided my channel from the other one. And then when the raid happened after the raid,
[4302.94s -> 4308.62s]  we made sure it went through. And then the other, the other stream was turned off. It just,
[4308.62s -> 4319.10s]  we just turned it off. So there was only one place where everything was going to be.
[4319.10s -> 4333.38s]  What is this pose? What the hell, what is this? What is this? Oh, very rare, complete back of the
[4333.38s -> 4344.20s]  head, by the way. Very rare. And I'll tell you, it's a, it's thinning a little, but pretty clean,
[4344.92s -> 4349.53s]  pretty clean back of the head. Probably could've used a little, I probably could've styled it a
[4349.53s -> 4356.97s]  little more. He's balding? Oh, I mean, not really. A little. Whatever. Fine. Oh, this,
[4356.97s -> 4370.02s]  where the thing hits me in the head. Nice Lego hair. Yeah, I pressed the wrong button. A stage
[4370.02s -> 4380.94s]  weight hits me in the head. Was it scripted? Yeah. It missed you. It hit me like on the forehead.
[4381.02s -> 4387.58s]  It went like, it scraped the top of my head and like scraped my nose. It's all right. It still,
[4387.58s -> 4399.50s]  doesn't matter. It still worked. How heavy was it? It was very heavy. No, it wasn't heavy at all.
[4399.50s -> 4407.78s]  The ice pack. I think I am going gray. I think it is happening. Right here, look. 4K camera.
[4407.78s -> 4422.63s]  You can't hide it. Maybe a little. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. This is right after the break when we came back
[4422.63s -> 4434.49s]  of me yelling at everybody and getting hit in the head. These things always fall out of my ear.
[4434.49s -> 4443.53s]  I remember this was such an issue for me. Uh, that before Dollhouse, we actually made a custom
[4443.53s -> 4452.28s]  one that I had to actually go, I had to go to a special lab to get a, a mold of the inside of my
[4452.28s -> 4464.49s]  ear. Just because these things always fall out. I always have such trouble with them. This feels
[4464.49s -> 4485.16s]  like it was upscaled. That's how good this camera is. Oh, best bro. That's the first one. You look
[4485.16s -> 4494.90s]  completely different in every picture. It's just, it's just angles. It's angles. So my,
[4494.90s -> 4502.52s]  my face is, and my hair is kind of different. This part of, this half of my face. Remember,
[4502.52s -> 4505.88s]  I've talked about this before. People that go, dude, why do you look like a different guy
[4505.88s -> 4513.86s]  in this picture? I'll tell you. Because I have an angular face. My face is pretty angular. So my face
[4513.86s -> 4521.94s]  kind of goes like this. My face goes like this. It's kind of sideways. So when you see from this
[4521.94s -> 4527.93s]  angle, you're seeing it go this way. When you, when I go like this, you're seeing the other part
[4527.93s -> 4532.55s]  where it's angled a different way. You know what I mean? My chin's a little more pronounced on this
[4532.55s -> 4540.47s]  side. It's because it's angular this way. My nose is kind of this way. Yeah. So it's just, it looks
[4540.47s -> 4550.90s]  a little different. You know what I mean? You're making this up. I am not making this up. That's
[4550.90s -> 4564.02s]  why everybody says that. Troll face. One thing I'll tell you though, one thing I am very, very
[4564.02s -> 4570.31s]  concerned about. I'm getting concerned about this and that's how you know I'm getting older.
[4570.31s -> 4575.24s]  I'm starting to get the turkey neck. Do you see what I mean? It's happening. I'm getting,
[4575.24s -> 4582.98s]  I'm kind of getting that like tortoise turkey neck. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. I'm gonna start moisturizing
[4582.98s -> 4590.87s]  that area. I'm gonna start to like, moisturize this area. Tighten it up. Uh-oh. It's starting.
[4590.87s -> 4606.26s]  Yeah, it's starting. I'm getting, it's happening. This is what happens when you turn 40.
[4606.26s -> 4615.35s]  Moist neck Andy. You're insecure. No, I'm really not. I'm just messing around. I'm very
[4615.35s -> 4631.98s]  comfortable with uh, with me. So I'm good. Another scary image. I love how he's just not
[4631.98s -> 4640.90s]  paying, he's kind of just ignoring me. Just hanging out with the boys. There it is.
[4647.70s -> 4657.61s]  Watching it on, that's funny. How the hell were they ever gonna do this? How are you ever gonna
[4657.61s -> 4672.15s]  do this? Let's be real. How were you ever going to do that? These swabs? Oh, oh, right, right,
[4672.15s -> 4678.36s]  right, right. For, okay. I was like, why does he have cotton swabs in his hand? Because we did the,
[4678.36s -> 4688.82s]  oh, I'm boxing, right? Okay. We're gonna give you like the, on the lip. Give you the uh, the ice pack.
[4688.82s -> 4693.14s]  The water, he kept squeezing the water and I opened my mouth and I would close my mouth and he would
[4693.14s -> 4707.38s]  keep squeezing it. You're doing COVID testing? This is a great shot. He was stealing your DNA.
[4707.38s -> 4722.74s]  I love the green of the room too. It just comes to life here. So if you want to know, the, the
[4722.74s -> 4730.46s]  set designer is the same set designer that did Juiced. You remember Omega Juicer, right? It's
[4730.46s -> 4737.78s]  the same exact person. They did an amazing job. She's one of those people that you can just say,
[4738.34s -> 4743.46s]  this is what I want it to look like and here's uh, here's some, a few paragraphs of what it looks
[4743.46s -> 4750.90s]  like. Can you make that a reality? Bet your ass I can. And it was better than I ever imagined.
[4750.90s -> 4759.58s]  This set was better than I thought it was going to look. It was just way better.
[4759.58s -> 4774.02s]  Bottom left face. That is a face. You're right. Did you actually play Cod? Yes. It's like,
[4774.02s -> 4780.70s]  ah, the bros, the bro is cheering on their bro in the finals of his fantasy football league
[4780.70s -> 4793.75s]  is what this looks like. Why do I look so weird? Like the last game of the season, man,
[4793.75s -> 4805.94s]  I could get the whole pot. I come with the whatever. This more Bugleberry.
[4805.94s -> 4817.06s]  Was the loss scripted? Yes, it was. Sorry to say. And when I was up like 3-0 in that first round,
[4817.06s -> 4825.74s]  I was like, oh shit, I actually can't win this because we had to, it wasn't scripted.
[4826.57s -> 4834.41s]  It wasn't planned. I'm lying. I'm sorry. I lied to you. Throwing for content. I was up 3-0.
[4834.41s -> 4846.57s]  I said, was the Bugleberry footage pre-recorded? So we, um, at the beginning of the stream,
[4846.57s -> 4852.46s]  we went over the whole thing. Yes, this whole thing was pre-recorded. Um, it's, I'll give you
[4852.46s -> 4860.15s]  a quick fun story. So, chess boxing, if you remember, I did the announcing. I actually
[4860.15s -> 4867.37s]  missed the rehearsal for chess boxing. I couldn't go because we were filming this. So, the day
[4867.37s -> 4873.18s]  before, before the chess boxing event, I was supposed to be at rehearsal and this was our,
[4873.18s -> 4878.94s]  we already planned to do this. So I missed the rehearsal and did this instead. And then the next
[4878.94s -> 4902.55s]  day, chess boxing. And then a week later, did this. He was directing Bugleberry. He's a director.
[4902.55s -> 4907.05s]  How come the extinguisher isn't streaming right now? I think the extinguisher did a stream
[4907.05s -> 4912.17s]  and talked about some behind the scenes stuff. It was awesome to work with. He, honestly, he came
[4912.17s -> 4920.25s]  in at such a clutch because originally the extinguisher was going to be one of these two.
[4920.25s -> 4929.38s]  That was what that actor was going to do. And we lost our, we, we had somebody cast as the hacker
[4929.38s -> 4937.02s]  already and we lost out on that. Um, there was some issues with getting that person to be able
[4937.02s -> 4943.53s]  to be in that, in this spot at this time. So very short notice. And this is, I'm not, I'm not even
[4943.53s -> 4949.66s]  talking two days before the show, three days before the show. It was somebody else has to be
[4949.66s -> 4958.09s]  the extinguisher. So came through and the clutch actually crushed it. And that was on three days
[4958.09s -> 4967.13s]  notice. Not even probably. Yeah. Well, Josh just linked the, if you want to hear some more behind
[4967.13s -> 4970.87s]  the scenes stuff from the extinguisher's point of view, there's a link in the chat right there.
[4970.87s -> 4977.98s]  But yeah, it just all came together and the room turning red with, we had the portal and everything
[4977.98s -> 4989.26s]  It got really weird. Yeah, there you go. Was the hacker always called the extinguisher?
[4989.26s -> 4998.34s]  No, we, we kind of bounced around a few names and it was like, should I be German986? Should I be,
[4998.34s -> 5002.70s]  you know, um, you know, like the murderer or something? We were just trying to figure out
[5002.70s -> 5016.84s]  random names. Nice theater shot. You said there's a shit stain on my pants? Oh, you said there's,
[5016.84s -> 5026.38s]  whatever. Why did I even read that? Why did I read that? This is what I strangled him.
[5026.54s -> 5033.51s]  Yeah, there was a, there was a production person that was just hanging out under his desk, just
[5033.51s -> 5038.63s]  like out of frame. And every time we, we obviously rehearsed this a few times and figured out exactly
[5038.63s -> 5043.67s]  how it was going to happen. It's actually so funny because I don't know if we should, if I could show
[5043.67s -> 5050.57s]  it, but when I put my leg through, this is a different pair of shoes. This is like, there's
[5050.57s -> 5060.04s]  not, I'm very clearly was wearing dress shoes and they were just these nice sneakers. So what
[5060.04s -> 5065.99s]  happened? You going through a portal, change the shoes. It was, hey, portals, fuck with stuff.
[5065.99s -> 5077.34s]  It was a poor, hey, it was a portal. Can't be perfect. Santa again. And you are going to
[5077.34s -> 5092.65s]  apologize. He was the real deal. He, you knew when he was walking around, he made noise. You could
[5092.65s -> 5101.64s]  hear Santa from down across the entire studio. He was wearing bells. It was just like, when he
[5101.64s -> 5106.54s]  would take a step. I think we actually had him take them off. So people weren't, wouldn't hear
[5106.54s -> 5131.10s]  it through the mic. My God, what the fuck? My eyes don't even look real. Those, my eyes don't look
[5131.10s -> 5137.30s]  real. They don't look like real people eyes. This doesn't look like a real person's eyes. Why are
[5137.30s -> 5151.10s]  they so like gelatinous? They're gelatinous. That's weird looking, the puzzle room. Oh, they actually
[5151.10s -> 5157.85s]  got Santa back there. I knew he was back there. Cool. See how big looking Santa is, is really
[5157.85s -> 5172.49s]  tall. I think this is when we chilled out and we just did the awards. Yeah. At this point,
[5172.49s -> 5177.75s]  I think it was like, it's time to relax because now we don't have to worry about any weird,
[5177.75s -> 5184.01s]  crazy shit. We're just going to do the awards now, which I hope that as the kind of day went
[5184.01s -> 5190.81s]  along, I was really hoping that people would, after all the weird stuff. All right. Now we're
[5190.81s -> 5204.55s]  just chilling. And this is just, we're hanging out now. I hope that came across. Yeah. Okay. Good.
[5204.55s -> 5209.72s]  It was good. Yeah. Cause I know a lot of people were looking forward to this and
[5209.72s -> 5215.26s]  every year we do this and I didn't want to ruin it. I wanted to kind of keep that same vibe. When
[5215.26s -> 5219.66s]  we did get back on the main channel, I wanted to have that same vibe from previous years.
[5219.66s -> 5228.06s]  We were just kind of chilling, hanging out, laughing. There was no rumble. No, there was no
[5228.06s -> 5232.22s]  time to do a rumble this year because this has obviously took up all the time that I would have
[5232.22s -> 5240.81s]  done something like that. And plus, I mean, if I, if I can't think of, for instance, okay,
[5240.81s -> 5245.21s]  should there be a rumble during this? I don't think it would have fit. I think it would have
[5245.21s -> 5254.57s]  been too much going on. So it essentially replaced it. I think it would have been way too disjointed
[5254.57s -> 5258.97s]  if it's, okay, guys, the channel we got, it's on a different channel and we're going to do the awards
[5258.97s -> 5262.73s]  and here comes the first match on the channel. Am I going to do it? I feel like people would be
[5262.73s -> 5272.36s]  like, what? I can't even pay attention, dude. Like, what the fuck is going on? But I, I don't want
[5272.36s -> 5278.79s]  to give away anything, but there, there I do. No, we're not going to talk about it. We're not
[5278.79s -> 5283.96s]  even going to talk about it. But no, there's not going to be a, there's not going to be a stream on
[5283.96s -> 5291.10s]  New Year's this, this time. I'm going to take some time here after this stream because it's been a
[5291.10s -> 5297.03s]  very, very busy, pretty chaotic few months. And I definitely want to just take a little bit of time
[5297.03s -> 5303.78s]  and spend time with people that I want to spend some time with, friends, family. There's, there's
[5303.78s -> 5309.42s]  a lot of catching up to do, I think. So I'm going to, after this, just kind of take off for a little
[5309.42s -> 5325.96s]  bit. When is Battleaxe? You'll see. You'll see. But yeah, I think this is getting to the end.
[5325.96s -> 5328.92s]  Oh, this is the best singing. That's right. We did best singing, worst singing, and then they
[5328.92s -> 5343.56s]  actually came on and did their routine. I'm just saying. I'm just saying. Top shelf vocal. Looking
[5343.56s -> 5361.77s]  for to hire a group that's phenomenal. I'm telling you. Oh, the misery. Had any of the actors or
[5361.77s -> 5368.01s]  production crew watched your streams before? Were they unfamiliar? Some of them did. I would say it
[5368.01s -> 5373.35s]  was probably 50-50 of people that have actually seen the stream before versus people that kind of
[5373.35s -> 5380.78s]  knew that the channel existed. It was probably, I think most people knew what the channel was,
[5380.78s -> 5388.38s]  but maybe not to the extent of some of the stuff that was happening. Did Atriok know who you were?
[5390.95s -> 5400.81s]  Yeah, I've hung out with Atriok many times in real life. He said, no, he didn't know. Imagine
[5400.81s -> 5405.05s]  he just didn't know who I was. Like all the times we've spent in real life together and he just
[5405.05s -> 5410.63s]  doesn't even remember. He's like, oh, I've never heard of you. That would be so awful. What would
[5410.63s -> 5417.77s]  you even say to something like that? Can you imagine if it's hanging out at least, at least
[5417.77s -> 5422.81s]  three times in real life? And this is not just, oh, hey, nice to meet you. It's like, oh, no, no,
[5422.81s -> 5429.70s]  we've literally been in the same room for six, seven straight hours together, multiple times.
[5429.70s -> 5435.80s]  To have later on, it'd be like, what's your channel again? What's your name? It'd be like,
[5435.80s -> 5447.50s]  dude, oh, come on. No, no, of course not. He's awesome. I don't know if you knew this,
[5447.50s -> 5452.70s]  but one of the elves is the best Smash Brothers Melee Donkey Kong player in the world. I did hear
[5452.70s -> 5474.81s]  that. I did hear that. That's awesome. In the world. Yeah, it was Ringler. Everyone was so nice, too.
[5476.82s -> 5484.12s]  It makes me happy every time doing something like this, just after the effort's all done.
[5484.12s -> 5499.74s]  It's just like kind of the smiles on everybody's faces. That's worth it. This stream is loud.
[5499.74s -> 5512.38s]  It's not. Volume's fine. You're getting one guide. Okay. Do you feel, do you feel pressure to remember
[5512.38s -> 5521.66s]  everybody? Um, I don't, I don't really see it that way. It's kind of just if people show up and
[5521.66s -> 5526.86s]  they're having fun and maybe I've heard of them before, maybe not, because I don't really know
[5526.86s -> 5532.15s]  very many people in the space. Very recently, the last year or so, I've actually even really
[5532.15s -> 5538.57s]  started talking to other streamers. That's pretty new. So I kind of don't really know very much of
[5538.57s -> 5556.78s]  the space already. So do you know me? I don't know. Yeah, off-brand connected me with BTS.
[5556.78s -> 5568.79s]  That was integral to this whole thing happening. So I thought we were friends. I don't know. I'm
[5568.79s -> 5580.84s]  sorry. I gotta be realistic. Is this the first time you worked with BTS? So in a production setting,
[5580.84s -> 5588.02s]  yes. Not, I mean, I was on Juiced, an episode of XQC's show, and they were doing it. So I've
[5588.02s -> 5595.69s]  worked kind of with them before, but never as, you know, part of the team to get a show off the
[5595.69s -> 5600.49s]  ground. I showed up and was on Juiced and obviously met most of the people that worked on this show,
[5601.58s -> 5617.51s]  but didn't, it wasn't part of any production stuff until this one. This is, I'm not punching
[5617.51s -> 5623.77s]  somebody, okay? This is, this looks like I'm like, I think we were, I think I was describing
[5623.77s -> 5634.94s]  something that I wanted to have happen. No, I'm not punching anybody. He was awesome too.
[5634.94s -> 5640.81s]  The Bugleberry video editing was between, I think, a couple different people, because there was the
[5640.81s -> 5646.12s]  VFX stuff that was on, there was the actual editing, and it's just, everybody did such a
[5646.12s -> 5666.68s]  great fucking job. Practical effects. Dude, stop showing your vacation pics and play Yakuza.
[5666.68s -> 5682.28s]  That was a good one. Don't time that person out. That was a good one. Hey, the snow! The snow.
[5683.08s -> 5690.73s]  Here's the thing about the snow. BTS is going to have at least a year or two worth of packing
[5690.73s -> 5706.41s]  material, because they're going to just repurpose this. Oh, didn't I, I put this in my, I chewed this
[5706.41s -> 5712.28s]  up, didn't I? I did, I picked, I picked up this, I was chewing it, it was on ground. Why did I do that?
[5712.28s -> 5722.41s]  I've just, I had like, a memory just kind of unlocked. That was weird. Yeah, and ruining the
[5722.41s -> 5740.73s]  puzzle too. Yeah, I did. Was that not on camera? Was it not on camera? It was, it was, okay. Now,
[5740.73s -> 5750.97s]  that's my desktop background. I haven't changed my desktop background since Windows 7 came out,
[5750.97s -> 5771.77s]  okay? Just for you to know. Why? I don't know, because I don't, when I get on the computer,
[5771.77s -> 5776.92s]  I go. It's time to do whatever I'm going to do. And it's not, I don't have any time to look at my
[5776.92s -> 5786.62s]  background. It's just, as long as it's just an unoffensive thing. Okay, mountains or a beach
[5786.62s -> 5792.46s]  or water. Just no, no, nothing going on. Just something that I don't, I just don't even need
[5792.46s -> 5797.62s]  to look at it. I usually turn my computer on and within five seconds of it booting,
[5797.62s -> 5808.42s]  a program is open taking up the screen anyways. I just don't, I just don't look at the background
[5808.42s -> 5813.80s]  and I don't think about it. Yeah, I used to change my background, but then I would be lazy
[5813.80s -> 5819.18s]  and it would be wallpaper for a game that came out four years ago. Or you know, no, no, not even
[5819.18s -> 5823.50s]  that. Like wallpaper for a DLC that came out. And it's like, that's not even relevant anymore. And
[5823.50s -> 5831.93s]  I just spend so much time. I think the last time, honestly, I think it was Reaper of Souls came up
[5831.93s -> 5836.33s]  and I was like, oh yeah, I'm going to put that angel as a background and stay there for like
[5836.33s -> 5849.26s]  three years or something. And I just, I was like, why do I have this elves playing in the snow?
[5849.26s -> 5858.31s]  Of course they are. There's bugleberry hanging out with some dogs. I think some of you have seen
[5858.31s -> 5877.75s]  this already. Not a real PC, fake PC type loud. There's, there's their script for the engineers.
[5877.75s -> 5892.97s]  Not a real PC, fake PC type loudly. Just, hey, pretty good. Hey, pretty good. Yeah, this is
[5892.97s -> 5902.81s]  obviously, this is the off-brand group. There's bugleberry's cookies. Don't leak the script.
[5902.81s -> 5910.15s]  Jerma, are you bugleberry? I mean, that's impossible considering he's in the room right now.
[5910.15s -> 5919.46s]  That's not possible. Pretty good hair here. Pretty good hairline. That's well lit too. That's a light
[5919.46s -> 5928.70s]  beaming down on the top slash back of my head. But no, this is a good moment. Why did you not,
[5928.70s -> 5935.58s]  why did you give them fake computers? Because I didn't want a real computer there. They're just
[5935.58s -> 5942.78s]  supposed to be pretending to be hacking and engineering, right? If there was a real computer
[5942.86s -> 5947.27s]  there, they would have been opening up random stuff. You know, they would press like Windows
[5947.83s -> 5954.52s]  space, like G or something and open up like the help menu. No, it was just, there's nothing there.
[5954.52s -> 5970.23s]  You look pretty tall here. Sick. I like this picture. They're all tall. It feels good though.
[5972.36s -> 5979.72s]  Finally, putting to rest the rumors that we are the same person. Finally, putting those rumors to
[5979.72s -> 5998.57s]  rest. Magic is real and I just proved it. There's no way, there's not a chance that during the live
[5998.57s -> 6005.37s]  portion of this stream, somebody was being a body double and put the costume on to do some of those
[6005.37s -> 6010.78s]  routines to make that seem like a real thing. Out of the question completely. There's no way.
[6011.80s -> 6027.32s]  Not possible. Magic is real. Don't believe the haters. And then here's the crew. Tons of people
[6027.32s -> 6039.13s]  here did a lot of stuff that you didn't see. BTS and some of their connections, they was great.
[6039.53s -> 6057.98s]  I'm so happy with it. Three of you are doing the same pose. Yeah, it's a picture. What's with you
[6057.98s -> 6063.98s]  guys and where hands are in photos? You know what I mean? Okay, can't go like this. Can't go like
[6063.98s -> 6070.30s]  this. Can't go like this. Can't go like this. You don't stand like, come on. People have different
[6070.30s -> 6082.78s]  ways that they stand in pictures. Did you increase the elves pay? It's funny you say that. I actually
[6082.78s -> 6089.30s]  a day or two ago sent a message to the group, to like the BTS group. It was like, hey,
[6089.30s -> 6092.66s]  let's actually do that. We should actually do like, we should give them an extra.
[6093.99s -> 6107.64s]  I said that like a few days ago, so it's fun. Five times zero is still zero. How did they even get
[6107.64s -> 6124.57s]  this in such a short amount of time? And then one more. And that's it. I accidentally used my Prime
[6124.57s -> 6132.02s]  sub and I'm now a founder for the RealGermaChristmas channel. Yeah, how many people subbed
[6132.02s -> 6146.41s]  to that channel? Could you have? I wonder what happens to those subs going just, all right,
[6146.41s -> 6162.12s]  well then whatever. That'll help pay for the stream. How come everyone's pointing? I don't know. I
[6162.12s -> 6167.37s]  think one person did it and then we all did it. Like, yeah, we're, let's go. I don't know. Why
[6168.73s -> 6176.23s]  did we all start pointing? I think it was like, number one? I don't know. Why did we point? Did I
[6176.23s -> 6182.22s]  start going like this? Or am I following somebody here? I wonder who the first person was to hold
[6182.22s -> 6205.29s]  their finger up. Mario post looking ass? Mario? That's actually fucking perfect. Mario! It's
[6205.29s -> 6219.21s]  Super Mario! Oh! I don't know. It was supposed and it was cool and everybody here is awesome.
[6219.21s -> 6229.94s]  Nah, hell of a job. And that's it for the year. I'll hang up for a little bit longer. Anybody have
[6229.94s -> 6234.73s]  any more questions about it? I don't want to give every single thing away because I feel like it's
[6234.73s -> 6241.42s]  more fun that way, but I gave a lot away. Switch between the two images really fast.
[6241.42s -> 6266.09s]  Yahoo! Oh my god. Was Puzzle Girl scripted? No. Before we started the stream, I genuinely went in
[6266.09s -> 6274.12s]  there and just walked around for maybe 15, 20 minutes and just was talking about stuff to do
[6274.12s -> 6280.46s]  in here and said, you know what? You guys are kind of free to do whatever you want. As long as, I mean,
[6280.46s -> 6286.60s]  obviously gave them a list of rules to follow for the grand scheme of things, right? But they were
[6286.60s -> 6302.76s]  able to creatively just kind of have fun, just do whatever. Was the face paint scripted? No.
[6302.76s -> 6309.78s]  Atrioc just kind of showed up with that. I think he found it somewhere. And I thought that was one
[6309.78s -> 6315.62s]  of those ice packs. So I thought he was icing my cheekbones. I was like, yeah, yeah, so come on.
[6315.62s -> 6319.22s]  You're going to come over here. I'm going to be sitting and you're going to give me snacks. You're
[6319.22s -> 6324.50s]  going to grab a bottle of water, hyping me up, you know, maybe put some ice pack on my face,
[6324.50s -> 6329.46s]  like as if I just got punched in the face during boxing. And that's what I thought that was. So he
[6329.46s -> 6342.46s]  just put it on. I was like, okay, that's what this is. Do you think next year you'll fail as if you
[6342.46s -> 6351.43s]  have to top the production quality? No, I don't think like that. I think that can intrude your
[6351.43s -> 6360.26s]  brain a lot. And if it has to be bigger and better every single time, you eventually hit a point of
[6360.26s -> 6369.18s]  no return where nothing can happen now because you've gone too far. So it's just if I have
[6369.26s -> 6377.90s]  something that I think is a fun idea, I'll just do it. That's pretty much it. There's no rhyme
[6377.90s -> 6384.84s]  or reason to it. There's no special quota that I want to hit or special amount of money that
[6384.84s -> 6391.22s]  something has to cost or how many people have to be involved. If it sounds fun, I'll do it.
[6391.22s -> 6397.21s]  And sometimes those things can happen very quickly. There are a couple of ideas that I
[6397.21s -> 6402.63s]  want to do this coming year that are not going to be huge, huge, big, big events that require
[6402.63s -> 6412.44s]  tons of people, but they're there. Maybe they will be. I don't know. Are you going to upload
[6412.44s -> 6417.10s]  these somewhere? I think a few of the highlight channels are starting to get the footage and
[6417.10s -> 6422.52s]  they're starting to upload them. The second channel, I think I'll have to get in touch with
[6422.52s -> 6431.72s]  the second channel people. Something's wanting to be perfect prevents it from happening. It's
[6431.72s -> 6435.56s]  better to half-ass something than to not do anything. Well, I don't think half-ass is the
[6435.56s -> 6443.40s]  right answer, but you're the first part I think is correct. If everything has to be perfect,
[6443.40s -> 6450.20s]  you'll never get anything done. Now, some stuff can be perfect. You can make sure certain aspects
[6450.20s -> 6458.44s]  are perfect, but if everything has to be perfect, it will never happen. And you put a lot of undue
[6458.44s -> 6465.32s]  stress on a lot of people that are working on it because if from the very get-go, this has to be
[6465.32s -> 6471.91s]  perfect. Every single person that you are telling that to or that you're making that kind of aware
[6471.91s -> 6478.89s]  that that's what's happening, you put pressure. There's a lot of pressure now to, well, fuck,
[6478.89s -> 6490.15s]  I can't screw this up because then I ruined it. Did you have that guy squat there on purpose?
[6490.15s -> 6504.82s]  No, nobody's squatting here on purpose. What about Grotto Beasts? Grotto Beasts is done. Let me just
[6504.82s -> 6514.49s]  make that clear. Grotto Beasts is done. But because of the scale of that project, there's a lot of
[6514.49s -> 6523.16s]  stuff that, and that's been, that project has been in the oven for a long time. And the idea was I
[6523.16s -> 6530.06s]  wanted it out for Christmas this year, but it's just, I don't want to just run it out the door.
[6530.46s -> 6535.46s]  Just to get it out there and release it. A lot of work and a lot of time has gone into it.
[6535.46s -> 6545.80s]  And it's, I told you guys this before, that project is, I mean, it's kind of just a huge
[6545.80s -> 6552.73s]  kind of community oriented project. It's a bunch of stream references. There's a bunch of jokes.
[6552.73s -> 6558.58s]  It's a bunch of things that over the last decade or so that we thought were interesting or funny
[6558.58s -> 6563.59s]  or whatever. So I want to make sure it's right. And I want to make sure it comes out correctly.
[6563.67s -> 6574.87s]  So yeah, it's done when it's done. Not very much longer. Very, very, very short amount of time.
[6574.87s -> 6579.45s]  There's a lot going on with that project, but I can promise you this. You'll get it at some
[6579.45s -> 6595.66s]  point very soon. Just not in a week. If you want more updates, Grotto Beasts team, you know,
[6595.66s -> 6600.73s]  they're working on some cool stuff on the Twitter. Go follow the Twitter. There are card reveals
[6600.73s -> 6609.82s]  happening all the time. They've already revealed a lot of cards. Every time Polly makes a post,
[6610.38s -> 6615.32s]  she's just excited. She's just like, I can't wait to press the tweet button. Just like,
[6615.32s -> 6632.63s]  it's awesome. When are you going to change your pin tweet? That's my New Year's resolution.
[6632.63s -> 6640.84s]  Can't wait. Yeah, that's been a long time coming too. Wait, it's actually a playable card game.
[6640.84s -> 6652.86s]  Yes. I will give a ton of details when I'm ready to do so. It started out, that whole project
[6652.86s -> 6658.20s]  started out as just kind of, I was like, wait, that would be kind of fun merch, wouldn't it?
[6658.28s -> 6665.90s]  Having kind of cards based on community references and stream stuff and put some
[6665.90s -> 6671.56s]  original characters in it. And it was going to be just kind of collectible, just cards.
[6671.56s -> 6678.94s]  Then I was like, wait a minute, it can be made into an actual game. And we have a game designer
[6678.94s -> 6687.42s]  that's been working on it for almost two years. Is it an NFT? No, it's cards. Like, you know,
[6687.42s -> 6699.35s]  sorry, I just punched you. Next year, are you going to do the live action Elden Ring thing
[6700.28s -> 6708.50s]  similar to Dollhouse? I've said this before. I don't really do, I don't like, I don't want
[6708.50s -> 6716.28s]  to do sequels. I think I've said that before. I don't want to do a sequel to Dollhouse,
[6716.28s -> 6725.34s]  but Dollhouse 2 could just be something else in that same world. I don't want to just do it.
[6725.34s -> 6732.76s]  And I know that, and okay, you want me to get real? Okay. Okay, you asked for it. You asked for it.
[6732.76s -> 6742.41s]  You want me to get real? Marketing and getting support for stuff that is not a concept that's
[6742.41s -> 6754.34s]  ever proven is hard. You probably noticed there was no sponsor on this show. There isn't. It's
[6754.34s -> 6761.78s]  hard to describe to people in the world of marketing, in the world of, you know, supporting stream
[6761.78s -> 6767.06s]  or something, right? I need money for this. It's like, what the fuck are you doing? Why are you
[6767.06s -> 6778.28s]  doing that? That's stupid. Or like, that's weird, but okay. Because there's no, look, if I wanted
[6778.28s -> 6786.84s]  to do Dollhouse 5, because Dollhouse 2, 3, and 4 have happened already, and they happened in the
[6786.84s -> 6796.01s]  last six months, then it would be probably very easy. But Dollhouse 2, 3, 4, and 5 would probably
[6796.01s -> 6803.24s]  be not very good. It probably wouldn't be good at all. Maybe, depends on what I want to do with it,
[6803.24s -> 6808.38s]  or what we want to do. Could it be better? But then that just goes back to the problem that we
[6808.38s -> 6814.52s]  talked about earlier with, are you concerned that things have to be bigger and better every time?
[6814.52s -> 6818.92s]  That is the problem with something like a sequel. That is a problem with something like a series on
[6818.92s -> 6827.85s]  the same idea. How do you keep it fun? How do you make it so the first one and the second one
[6827.85s -> 6841.78s]  are in the same world? Would we just do the same jokes? How do you do more? What do you do?
[6841.78s -> 6848.18s]  And that's been the motivation the whole time, has been making sure that something seems like
[6848.18s -> 6855.54s]  a fun thing to do, and it's new every time, and it's different every time. So trying to convince
[6855.54s -> 6864.15s]  people that shows like this, I think they matter to me a lot, but they're hard to sell to people
[6864.15s -> 6868.74s]  because they just don't, it's just like, what are you doing? It's like, oh, but we did Dollhouse.
[6868.74s -> 6873.96s]  Do you remember Dollhouse? Yeah, but this isn't Dollhouse. I'm just gonna hack your fucking stream.
[6873.96s -> 6882.47s]  What are you talking about? Oh, but it's gonna be fun though, I promise. But we don't know that.
[6882.47s -> 6889.96s]  We don't know that. This stream could have been awful. We don't know that because we haven't done
[6889.96s -> 6894.73s]  it before. That's the problem for a lot of people in the marketing world.
[6904.94s -> 6912.41s]  Dollhouse 2 is Dollhouse, but it is just a stream of you playing Yakuza. What, in the Dollhouse?
[6912.41s -> 6927.46s]  You can go off numbers though. Not really. Not, I mean, not really. You don't need to be in the
[6927.46s -> 6933.06s]  Dollhouse. But yeah, a Dollhouse 2 to me, and people have asked this many times, like what
[6933.06s -> 6938.62s]  would that even be? It would be something like we were just talking about. It would be a different
[6938.62s -> 6954.58s]  concept, but in that same world of interaction. Chat, marketing, experts, incoming. But yeah,
[6954.58s -> 6963.11s]  to cap that conversation and to kind of put a lid on it, it's still trying to get shows off the
[6963.11s -> 6973.66s]  ground and have them financed is still the thing that's not simple. Sometimes you don't need it.
[6973.66s -> 6979.16s]  I don't think, honestly, I think a sponsor would have taken it probably away from this show,
[6979.16s -> 6986.71s]  don't you think? I don't think I would have wanted one anyways. And we were talking to people. We
[6986.71s -> 6993.24s]  had some lines out there for what this could be. They don't all have to have sponsors on them,
[6993.24s -> 7001.43s]  but that needs to come from somewhere. And sometimes when a show is, I mean, I don't want to,
[7001.43s -> 7006.04s]  I mean, I sort of want to lay out financing to anybody like, oh, here's all the money.
[7006.76s -> 7014.30s]  But shows that cost more than 100, 200 plus thousand dollars, they, you almost need to be
[7014.30s -> 7022.81s]  secure. You need to make sure that it's possible. Most of the stuff that you've seen on this channel,
[7022.81s -> 7030.02s]  that was a big elaborate kind of show stream, were over, over a hundred thousand dollars to do
[7031.21s -> 7039.54s]  for each one. Not all of them, but most of them, some of them much higher. So it is,
[7040.74s -> 7047.14s]  it is a struggle sometimes. And look, I don't have to, it's very easy for you to do back in
[7047.14s -> 7051.22s]  the napkin math on this channel. This channel makes a good amount of money. This channel makes
[7051.22s -> 7059.67s]  a lot of money. But even still, it's still, even with that, it's still, and I'll have to say,
[7060.47s -> 7074.49s]  I don't want to just, you know, go to fucking zero, right? Just to do this stuff. It can be scary.
[7074.49s -> 7084.10s]  But no, it's still a concern. Now, thankfully, there's been, I've done a lot of sponsors this
[7084.10s -> 7092.74s]  year. And I think they, I enjoyed myself on them. So I'm happy to do those. But it has to be,
[7093.30s -> 7100.81s]  I don't know, I just don't want to fuck it all up. I hope that, if that makes sense.
[7100.81s -> 7110.54s]  I don't want to fuck this all up, because it's, you can. And trying to balance money and content,
[7110.54s -> 7115.82s]  and I want to still try to be creative, but seeing things to be paid for, I just don't want to fuck
[7115.82s -> 7125.78s]  the whole thing up, if I'm honest. And there's been sponsors where I've kind of gone back and
[7125.78s -> 7136.62s]  forth and then been like, no, nevermind. But yeah, and I also don't want, here's another thing too,
[7136.62s -> 7143.54s]  that I don't want to see. And it's not that I'm, you know, see it or anything, but I also don't
[7143.54s -> 7152.01s]  want to put myself in the channel upon a pedestal, because that's a bad idea. I don't want to be this,
[7152.01s -> 7158.09s]  oh, everything has to be fucking so good. And oh, wow, I've got to make sure, I don't want to,
[7158.09s -> 7169.21s]  you know, you got to be careful. Because this channel, a lot of really nice things are said
[7169.21s -> 7177.53s]  about this place. So I'm just going to keep doing what I'm doing, and try to do it as good as I can,
[7177.53s -> 7185.56s]  and try to do everything the way that I would have always done it. But it can be hard.
[7187.99s -> 7191.99s]  Because, you know, when people talk about this space, and people talk about, oh shit, wow, that
[7191.99s -> 7199.06s]  was so awesome. Like, that was really fun. But I don't want to fuck it up. And I don't want it to,
[7199.06s -> 7206.41s]  like, get, actually get into my brain, and kind of ruin the way that I see this place. If that makes
[7206.41s -> 7227.56s]  sense. What about the infomercials? Yeah, we'll watch more infomercials. Of course we will. Nice
[7227.56s -> 7236.73s]  lava cake here. Yeah. We need to see, what did you say? We need to see the document of German lore
[7236.73s -> 7244.25s]  you sent to the extinguisher. It was, it was, okay. You know what it was? I was in mod chat,
[7244.25s -> 7249.10s]  and we were talking about all the things that I didn't do, that I said I was going to do.
[7249.10s -> 7254.39s]  And I was like, do you guys have any more shit that I keep lying about? So the mods got together,
[7254.39s -> 7258.71s]  and I think some of the community people were tapped into to be like, what have I said that
[7258.71s -> 7265.91s]  we can just give this guy? The mods were in on it, by the way. And I don't want, I'm not going to,
[7265.91s -> 7274.34s]  I don't want to spoil anything, but who was modding the other stream? I wonder. Interesting.
[7274.34s -> 7289.54s]  Who could that be? Random people. Do a Blue's Clues stream. No. But yeah, I know after doing
[7289.54s -> 7298.90s]  stuff like this, and when we go over behind the scenes, and you get that kind of, that post fun
[7298.90s -> 7307.06s]  thing kind of slow down, where it's like, oh, that was fun. Oh, do you remember when I was there?
[7307.06s -> 7323.37s]  That was so fun. Oh, okay. Yeah. I like being involved in stuff like this. And I think the
[7323.37s -> 7339.00s]  future of my life, wherever it goes, whatever it is, I hope is in spaces like this. Because I
[7339.00s -> 7349.98s]  find this to be some of the most fun, and some of the most engaging. And maybe doing some more,
[7350.62s -> 7357.67s]  like, creative directing. Maybe start doing more writing, if I can. Come up with some stuff.
[7358.39s -> 7373.35s]  Maybe help other people. We're not using this photo, though. The Jerma movie. No, I already
[7373.35s -> 7382.98s]  shut that down. I already shut that down. I would, okay, if I had like a five million dollar budget,
[7382.98s -> 7388.74s]  a million of it would be blown on having like five hot air balloons take us to set every day.
[7388.74s -> 7392.66s]  And it'd be like, why is he doing this? Tell him to stop spending that money. Be like, I have to.
[7392.66s -> 7407.30s]  We have to. It's to get everybody into the right mindset. Add another million for hair product.
[7407.30s -> 7421.80s]  You just win the lottery. I already did. I already did. You understand? Think about it.
[7421.80s -> 7428.20s]  I already did. And we could sit here and talk about like, oh, man, like, man, I'm doing big
[7428.20s -> 7432.22s]  shows, man, I really wish this would happen. Oh, man, you know, I loved it. I already did hit the
[7432.22s -> 7441.10s]  fucking lottery. So whatever happens from here is extra. So because I know that it's a huge,
[7441.10s -> 7454.55s]  huge fucking it's very difficult to be able to get into this space. Cheesy Charles. Yeah,
[7454.55s -> 7472.38s]  Cheesy Charles is showing up to tell you that. Cheesy Charlie. Dude, bro, I'm crying. Stop being
[7472.38s -> 7477.80s]  so sappy already. This is the last time I'm going to see you until the new year. Come on. I'm allowed
[7477.80s -> 7492.50s]  to be a little sappy. But no, this is, this is the stuff that I find the most fun. And I would like
[7492.50s -> 7504.44s]  to continue to do it. But yeah, not even sappy. Why was I not even sappy? How am I sappy, Steve?
[7506.01s -> 7509.77s]  I said, no, I said, fuck. I said, who gives, I, well, what the fuck, right? That's no, it's not
[7509.77s -> 7519.90s]  sad. I'm not cheesy anymore. I'm cool. Cheesy fucking Charlie. Yeah, you think so? I just swore
[7519.90s -> 7525.91s]  a few times. All right. That's going to be it. I was thinking about playing something, but I got a
[7525.91s -> 7534.41s]  lot of stuff to do. So let's talk about some stuff very quickly going into the new year.
[7534.41s -> 7540.15s]  Going to be bringing back. We're going to be going back to the basics a little bit.
[7540.15s -> 7547.32s]  There's no major, major things planned for the month of January, really into February. We're
[7547.32s -> 7552.57s]  going to be going besides Grotto Beast, obviously, which is going to be a huge deal. I'm going to go
[7552.57s -> 7559.42s]  back to kind of normal streams, going to bring back some more chill streams, maybe play some games
[7559.42s -> 7573.08s]  and go from there. So in the new year, you sound like a teacher, whatever. Yeah, there's potentially
[7573.08s -> 7578.76s]  some Elden Ring stuff to do. There's lots of games that I didn't play the last few weeks because I've
[7578.76s -> 7587.48s]  just been very busy. So yeah, we'll get back to it. Back to the basics. Can we do some meme react
[7587.48s -> 7597.70s]  video? Maybe. But yeah, those are my thoughts. I think it was a great way to end the year.
[7597.78s -> 7605.38s]  Everybody did a phenomenal job. I'm very, very happy about it. And I feel good. It feels good.
[7605.38s -> 7614.76s]  And that's pretty much all there is to it. Vampire Survivors. Yeah, I have a very, very,
[7614.76s -> 7625.08s]  I have a confession. I played the DLC already and it was very fun. I'm sorry. I didn't have time.
[7625.08s -> 7632.63s]  I'm sorry. I didn't have time. By the way, very quickly, did you guys know,
[7634.07s -> 7641.69s]  somebody please correct me because I cannot believe this. Vampire Survivors is on iOS now
[7641.69s -> 7653.19s]  and it's free. Is that correct? I'm trying to find the catch. It's just for free. Full game is
[7653.19s -> 7662.55s]  for free. It's free. The whole thing. There's no catches. It's just a free video game on iOS
[7662.55s -> 7680.55s]  right now. Is there ads on it? I don't think so. Are you sure? I haven't seen any. How long
[7680.55s -> 7700.58s]  did I play it for? What do you say this? I'm going to be bat chested. Stop. It's ads to revive.
[7701.62s -> 7705.88s]  Only ads are there. Yeah, there are ads, but it's free. Who cares? The only ads are if you
[7705.88s -> 7712.23s]  die and want to respawn for like extra coins and stuff. Who gives a shit? That's fucking,
[7712.23s -> 7718.78s]  the whole game is free. The catch is you have to play it on iOS. Pepe laugh.
[7718.78s -> 7731.66s]  Can we get one more cat puke to end the year? No. All right. I'll see you guys later. Thanks
[7731.66s -> 7737.26s]  for watching. I know the last few streams have been just kind of hanging out and then the Christmas
[7737.26s -> 7742.81s]  thing, but we'll get back to it in the new year. I'll see you guys soon. Take care of yourselves.
[7742.81s -> 7749.18s]  Have a great holiday. Have an awesome new year's. I probably won't see you. I'll be back
[7749.18s -> 7759.42s]  probably on, probably the second or third of January is probably when I'll turn the stream
[7759.42s -> 7763.93s]  back on and we'll just kind of go back to normal. Yeah. Merry Christmas. Happy holidays. Happy new
[7763.93s -> 7773.19s]  year. Thanks for playing along on that stream. I really could have gone either way and I'm glad
[7773.19s -> 7779.85s]  that for the most part people were having fun and playing along and even after the two streams
[7779.85s -> 7795.98s]  converging, I'm just happy to see everybody had a good time. So see you later. Take care and let's
[7795.98s -> 7812.20s]  do this. Thanks for the subs. Didn't you Lala? At least you promised. Lala. See? I'm keeping my
[7812.20s -> 7828.84s]  promises now. Was that the real Santa? That was a real Santa. That was a real Santa. That was Santa.
[7828.84s -> 7836.68s]  Why are you even asking that question? Okay. Now I actually do the hundred subs. Oh shit. Yeah.
[7836.84s -> 7846.30s]  I actually don't think I can right now. All right. On the first stream, the first stream
[7846.30s -> 7850.94s]  of the new year, tell me to do that because I will. That's new year's resolution. We're going to fix
[7850.94s -> 7870.68s]  some of these. We're going to right some of these wrongs from last year. Please bro. Yeah. Again,
[7870.68s -> 7880.81s]  huge thanks to Offbrand, to Ludwig, Atrioc, obviously Nick, Stans. They were great to work
[7880.81s -> 7892.58s]  with. I'd love to work on stuff with them again. BTS. Everybody was so good. All the set design.
[7893.46s -> 7910.54s]  It was just so good. I'm so thankful and so grateful. Yeah. The Extinguisher. There's so
[7910.54s -> 7923.58s]  many people to thank and just so many people that contributed a lot. But yeah. Have a great holiday.
[7923.58s -> 7933.82s]  Can we get one more scorn for the year? Sure. Let me figure out how I'm going to do that.
[7989.10s -> 8006.18s]  See you guys later. See you in the new year.
