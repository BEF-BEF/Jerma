[0.31s -> 12.26s]  Gemma985 is filmed in front of a live studio audience.
[12.26s -> 26.18s]  Okay, let me get things all settled here. Got my microphone, I got everything set, got the gameplay, ready to record.
[26.18s -> 27.68s]  Alright, let's do it.
[27.68s -> 28.68s]  Ahem, ahem.
[28.68s -> 31.74s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jermi-
[31.74s -> 33.24s]  Oh, making a commentary?
[34.24s -> 42.82s]  Well, I was trying to until I was rudely interrupted.
[43.32s -> 48.67s]  No, but seriously, man, you look stressed. What's, uh, what's wrong?
[48.67s -> 55.67s]  Ah, yeah, just got back from the grocery store. The lines were really long, but I managed to pick up some fruits and vegetables on the way home.
[55.67s -> 58.67s]  Oh, I'm gonna be making some of my famous chicken pot pie.
[60.81s -> 64.31s]  Oh boy, looks like we're doing takeout again tonight.
[67.15s -> 69.15s]  Why wasn't I invited in the shindig?
[75.44s -> 80.44s]  Boon, I didn't know you were coming over. God, I had so many interruptions. I'm never gonna get this commentary.
[80.44s -> 84.44s]  Um, guys, this isn't part of the video right now. I just got a phone call.
[84.94s -> 89.38s]  Um, everybody I've ever met in my life is in the hospital right now. I have to go.
[90.38s -> 95.64s]  Pizza? I didn't think we were gonna get pizza. Hang on, I'll be right back. I'm gonna get my wallet.
[100.27s -> 107.27s]  Let's, uh, let's do this commentary now. I can sit down, I can actually do this freaking thing. I don't have to keep getting interrupted by people, so-
[107.27s -> 111.27s]  Hey, motherfucker! It's me, Grandpa!
[112.27s -> 115.37s]  What are you doing?
[115.37s -> 117.61s]  Um, working on a commentary, actually.
[118.11s -> 123.11s]  Oh yeah, working on a commentary. Look at me! My name is Gerber! Working on a commentary! Look at how smart I am!
[125.82s -> 131.82s]  Yeah, that's- I'm trying to get it done, so I would appreciate it if you just took off for a little while, Grandpa.
[131.82s -> 133.82s]  That's okay, I'll leave you to your work.
[133.82s -> 139.34s]  Cause I- I'll just leave you to your work. I'm gonna make sure-
[139.34s -> 146.80s]  Don't- I- Tonight can you hear me talk? I didn't even say anything funny! Shut the fuck up!
[148.61s -> 151.61s]  I forgot my line. They really just screwed me over right there.
[152.11s -> 157.11s]  You know what I'm saying? Thank you! Thank you, studio audience! You really fucked it all up for me!
[157.11s -> 164.54s]  Yeah, you know what that is? That's the double middle finger. You can laugh all you want, I don't give a shit. I'm outta here.
[164.54s -> 166.54s]  Alright, well, see you later.
[166.54s -> 170.54s]  Can I finally get this thing done? For Pete's sake, here we go.
[170.54s -> 177.17s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Gerber here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[177.17s -> 181.17s]  And tonight, gonna be playing as the Soldier with me, and that's it!
