[2.23s -> 6.23s]  Yeah, let's play House of the Dead. That was Dinosaur Fossil Hunter, and it was a really interesting game. It was really cool.
[6.23s -> 14.66s]  But I want to play, I want to like, shoot the zombies right now. NA infrastructure, Omega LoL.
[14.66s -> 22.02s]  Um, Nevada, Las Vegas is like, one of the top five in the country for infrastructure, so excuse me, take that back please.
[22.02s -> 26.26s]  Nevada, like, honestly is like, number three in infrastructure in the whole country.
[26.26s -> 29.46s]  I just, just, I mean, I have to correct people when they say something incorrect.
[29.46s -> 40.42s]  Alright, House of the Dead. Do I play this with a mouse? It's just a mouse aiming game?
[40.50s -> 53.83s]  So this is a House of the Dead remake. Hopefully it's not loud. Please don't be loud. Please don't be loud. I turned it down, but please don't be loud.
[53.83s -> 78.23s]  Okay, here it comes. I need a game capture, new capture. Let's go, where is it? Right here.
[78.23s -> 95.82s]  Don't, there it is. Okay, why's my camera all laggy now?
[95.82s -> 106.09s]  Uh, the wind. This game does not want to be captured. What the fuck is happening? Watch out for...
[108.38s -> 121.74s]  What is going on? Okay, I think we're alright. What the fuck just happened?
[121.74s -> 133.82s]  Options. Game, is this the, did I open the right ga-? Hello? Who's there? Oh!
[134.94s -> 154.60s]  Um, shadow quality medium? That was very jarring. Okay, so display. Huge scale. Um, hide the HUD.
[155.58s -> 165.13s]  Brightness, I don't know, here. Quality, what, what frame rate is this at? Gameplay. Use vibrations.
[165.13s -> 175.21s]  No. No. AMO on crosshair? No. Like, maybe? No, that's ugly. Automatic reload. Quiet!
[176.01s -> 182.82s]  Automatic reload. Aim assist medium? I don't know what that means. What should my player color be?
[184.98s -> 198.34s]  Outside thickness. Crosshair speed? I don't know. Sound. Alright, I think I'm ready.
[198.34s -> 206.28s]  Keyboard, mouse, sensitivity. Turn it down. Alright, let's go. Let's go!
[207.86s -> 212.58s]  Welcome in the House of the Dead remake. There are many ways to play the game, so make sure you
[212.58s -> 219.46s]  review all options and create a session that suits you best. Okay, got it. Original. Okay,
[219.46s -> 225.66s]  difficulty normal. Classic mode. Multiplayer mode. I don't want to play fucking multiplayer.
[225.66s -> 236.33s]  Alright, this one. Chapter one. Tragedy. Just, I just shoot the fucking zombies. I bet you can't
[236.33s -> 252.73s]  name a field of research this is based off of. The morgue? Alright, let's go! Uh, can one of the
[252.73s -> 280.90s]  mods change the game? Jesus Christ. Nice. Alright, let's go. House of the Dead. Sensitivity's not
[280.90s -> 301.16s]  bad. I might need a little bit higher. How do I reload? How do you reload? R? R. Oh, fuck you.
[301.88s -> 310.81s]  Is the calibration wrong? Yeah, guys, I'm holding up the gun like this and this is where the gun is
[310.81s -> 317.62s]  aiming and here is where it is on the screen. God, these old machines are such pieces of shit.
[317.62s -> 325.99s]  Turn aim assist off. Okay. That always sucked the most. Every time that you went with like the
[325.99s -> 330.34s]  two or three of your friends and there was like a time crisis or like House of the Dead
[330.34s -> 336.10s]  and you were the sorry motherfucker that got the one that had like seven inches of wrong calibration.
[336.10s -> 340.66s]  It was such a pain because you had to cost money. You had to spend 50 cents for a life to do that.
[340.66s -> 349.24s]  That's not fair. Alright, turn off. Turn this off. Yeah, I don't need, I don't want that.
[349.24s -> 354.18s]  Alright, let's go. I think sensitivity needs to be a little bit higher.
[354.18s -> 359.94s]  Before my whole, before my house blows down. Okay. Like, honest to God, I'm like, I feel like,
[359.94s -> 369.80s]  I feel like the zombies are coming for me right now. I feel like I'm pretty good at this.
[380.25s -> 399.27s]  This music. Does the game feel like it's in times two speed for anybody else?
[412.12s -> 448.52s]  Got it. Extra health, right? Nice. I wish I had a light gun right now. Whoa, close. Got it. Frog.
[456.18s -> 475.18s]  Jesus. I feel like I bought extra coffee. Shit. I feel like I drank too much coffee.
[475.18s -> 478.70s]  Did I have way too much coffee? Everything feels like it's a hundred miles per hour. I
[478.70s -> 494.58s]  drank way too much coffee. No, I got to shoot that bug. Oh no, I just got the Giga Chad.
[501.90s -> 510.97s]  What? I freaked out. Why did I do that? Why did I do that? I sat there for so long.
[511.93s -> 519.22s]  And I like knew what was happening. I was in slow motion. The only part that was in slow motion
[519.22s -> 563.80s]  was what just happened. Now give me some health. Got it. Ah, fuck you. I'm going to die. There's
[563.80s -> 593.32s]  like skin all over my mouth. Skin all over my mouth. We're good. Who's this? Holy Jesus.
[596.73s -> 598.33s]  Carry type weak point in the chest.
[624.82s -> 630.28s]  I got him. I did it. That was insane.
[645.22s -> 652.90s]  Why would I take a picture? Why did I take a pic? Oh, these are all the people that are left alive.
[652.90s -> 662.34s]  Okay. All right. Not bad. This hidden treasure somewhere in this area.
[666.68s -> 697.90s]  Second chapter. All right. Stop panic firing and just shoot down here. I got it. Excuse me.
[697.90s -> 709.11s]  What was that? What are you doing? How did I die? Shut the fuck up. Continue. How many credits do
[709.11s -> 757.80s]  I have? 10. I got 10 coins. Hardy Kroger. Whoa. Damn it. This game's terrifying. It's too much.
[758.52s -> 764.55s]  The worst part about playing these games alone is there's not three other people in the room
[764.55s -> 767.75s]  that I can like pretend I'm playing and they can actually shoot this shit. I have to actually kill
[767.75s -> 810.87s]  everything. I can't miss. I have to kill them. Got it. Give me that health. I shot him in the
[810.87s -> 849.21s]  head like three times. It's bullshit. Oh, shut up. Whoa. I missed and I even pre-fired him.
[863.96s -> 889.06s]  Oh my goodness. Treasure chest. Oh, there's a person behind there. Thank you. Oh, I hate that.
[893.26s -> 897.34s]  In midair, you go all the way back out. That guy didn't even know what happened.
[897.82s -> 963.13s]  Peace. You're welcome. What's that? Whatever. Oh, I'm good. I'm good. Nice. Oh, we're good.
[973.24s -> 998.55s]  Don't run in front of me. Give me a treasure chest. Oh shit. How am I supposed to fall asleep to this?
[998.55s -> 1051.40s]  Hi. Weak point. Top right. Okay. Let's go. I'm going to puke. I hate this. I hate to throw up.
[1054.49s -> 1068.89s]  Oh, wait. Auto reload. Five seconds? Every second?
[1099.00s -> 1104.65s]  Okay. Okay. I'm good. What? The title is reload?
[1115.11s -> 1120.58s]  We won't let you have it your way. I think auto reload is probably worse.
[1121.22s -> 1142.44s]  Afraid of spiders. Oh God. Truth. Yeah. Auto reload sucks. Can I turn off the guy saying
[1142.44s -> 1160.92s]  reload? You can mute reload. Okay. You can mute reload. That's funny. Okay. Now I don't care.
[1160.92s -> 1192.66s]  Nice. Go back. No, it's, I don't want to go back. The bullets bouncing around the room a million
[1192.66s -> 1219.77s]  times. Duck, man. Get out of the way. That was pretty good. That was pretty good shot. Wait,
[1219.77s -> 1235.38s]  what? I don't, what happened? I don't get it. Whatever. I threw like a handful of change in
[1235.38s -> 1247.53s]  the dryer. Okay. That's like, this is fucking crazy. I can't even play the game. All right.
[1247.53s -> 1292.92s]  See if I can do it. Am I winning? What happened? Oh, dead. Bring back reload. No. I don't like it.
[1305.40s -> 1307.56s]  Isn't there machine guns in the game? You can like click on it. It's like,
[1308.28s -> 1336.78s]  that didn't even hit me. That's such bullshit. Oh, come on. Get out of my way here. This is a
[1336.78s -> 1364.82s]  classic game. Can you play the classic version without the updated graphics? No? Hit again. I'm
[1364.82s -> 1400.70s]  gonna run out of coins. Say reload. Fine. Reload. Reload. Reload. Reload. Reload. Reload. Reload.
[1402.22s -> 1423.66s]  That's better. Reload. Reload. Reload. Reload. Reload. Reload. Are you happy? Reload. Reload.
[1424.54s -> 1452.44s]  Fuck you. Who cares? I'm just going to play the game. Who cares? Watch out.
[1458.06s -> 1463.30s]  What is that weird voice? It's hard for me to even hear what I'm even saying. I'll be honest.
[1470.60s -> 1476.84s]  The voice changer is not still on. You guys are making me waste continues and I don't
[1476.84s -> 1481.72s]  want to fucking have to use it. I'm like, I'll fucking, fucking say swear. I'm not swearing ever
[1481.72s -> 1536.82s]  again. Is this the last level? All right. Right in the head. That was easy. Wait, was I supposed to
[1536.82s -> 1580.89s]  win that fast? Holy shit. That was really loud. That was scary. All right. I only have seven coins
[1580.89s -> 1594.25s]  left. You're not using a dysfunctional NES light gun. This doesn't count. I mean, okay. I have
[1594.25s -> 1602.65s]  some thoughts about this game. I'll zip. I think it's hard to make a game like this when you use
[1602.65s -> 1608.41s]  the mouse. When, I mean, the difficulty in this game comes from being able to actually aim the
[1608.41s -> 1623.08s]  light gun. Zit? What? What are you saying? Zit? Where? Where? What are you talking about? Where?
[1623.08s -> 1664.12s]  Where? Where do you see a zit? What are you talking about? Photo mode. God damn it. Oh shit.
[1679.40s -> 1695.98s]  Shit. My arm hurts. My fucking arm hurts. My fucking hand hurts. All right. I'm good.
[1695.98s -> 1705.67s]  I don't want to fight the guy that flies, right? Do I have to? Of course I do.
[1717.08s -> 1727.61s]  Oh my god. I can shoot with the space bar. Everything has changed.
[1728.25s -> 1757.64s]  Everything's changed. I can shoot with space bar. Ow.
[1790.18s -> 1798.44s]  Find reload to your mouse? No, man. That's not happening. Ow. I'm gonna run out of continues.
[1805.18s -> 1805.68s]  Zit?
[1837.05s -> 1839.13s]  I don't know. I think I could take it.
[1859.14s -> 1866.84s]  What did he drop? What happened? What happened?
[1868.07s -> 1892.62s]  Uh-oh. Unknown. Oh shit. It's Mewtwo. You gotta shoot him in the muscle tissue.
[1892.62s -> 1901.58s]  This game's giving me a headache. I actually have a headache again.
[1902.70s -> 1917.61s]  This game is so fucking loud and like the sound effects. It sounds like an animal got into a
[1917.61s -> 1936.52s]  fucking restaurant kitchen and started running around and smashing stuff. Somebody get that.
[1936.52s -> 1943.94s]  Somebody get that fox. Somebody get him. Somebody grab that fox.
[1944.74s -> 1954.38s]  Oh my god. I can't lose here. I got four continues. I can't fuck this up.
[1968.38s -> 1983.29s]  Oh shit. I'm gonna lose. Fuck. No, don't lose. I'm getting weak. I'm getting weak.
[1990.98s -> 2006.54s]  Guys, I'm getting weak. One of the chefs. One of the chefs comes out of the restaurant.
[2007.10s -> 2012.86s]  Comes out of like the door of the kitchen and the fox is on his face and he's like running around
[2012.86s -> 2022.20s]  like bumping into tables and shit. Is this as loud as it is for me as it is for you?
[2025.42s -> 2027.34s]  Okay. No, don't fuck. I have two continues.
[2145.42s -> 2149.10s]  Oh, I'm getting weak. Oh, I'm slowing down. Actually, I'm slowing down.
[2149.10s -> 2166.92s]  Okay, I win. Well, no, it's not gonna be phase two, right?
[2167.24s -> 2198.10s]  Everything is over. Nothing more must go on. Goodbye. Farewell.
[2198.10s -> 2242.20s]  I did it. Accept. How do I accept? Accept. Tab is accept. I don't care. That was crazy.
[2242.20s -> 2260.02s]  That was just crazy. I feel like that was weird. A new chapter came out? New chapter?
[2260.02s -> 2280.22s]  Okay, wait. New campaign. Oh, I can do horde mode. Let me try this and then maybe I shouldn't.
[2282.47s -> 2299.82s]  Hey, my head's killing me right now. Let's go into chapter four. Horde mode. Take a break.
[2299.82s -> 2306.50s]  I'm probably gonna end the stream. Honestly, I was laughing at like...
[2307.62s -> 2309.54s]  All right. What does horde mode mean? I just want to know what it means.
[2313.26s -> 2322.68s]  Oh, no way. It was kind of... Dude, how the fuck are you supposed to do this?
[2323.48s -> 2349.43s]  I used bit rate? What do you mean? All right. Yeah, I'm done. I'm done. This is like making it worse.
[2350.23s -> 2360.14s]  This is making it worse. This game's fun. It's all right. It's cool. They remade it. I mean,
[2360.14s -> 2374.04s]  I would like a light gun in my hand, but you know, whatever. I just want to see what makes
[2374.04s -> 2382.50s]  this horde mode. I'm done. I'm not playing against this guy. I'm not playing against that guy.
[2382.50s -> 2399.38s]  That was kind of fun. That was House of the Dead remake. Okay, so here's the plan. I didn't stream
[2399.38s -> 2402.76s]  yesterday because I had a bad migraine and I was like, I'm gonna be careful today because I don't
[2402.76s -> 2408.18s]  want to make it worse so I don't like fuck up the rest of the week's streams. So I'm just gonna stop.
[2411.18s -> 2418.82s]  I'm drinking water. I'm all right. That was kind of fucking wild. Short one today,
[2418.82s -> 2427.88s]  but I will be back. We will do a full one on... Where's today? We'll be back on Tuesday,
[2427.88s -> 2432.36s]  probably Tuesday and Wednesday. I have a lot of games to play. We got Later Alligator,
[2433.70s -> 2453.56s]  Bloodwash, power game shit. We got Murder House. Oh my God. Hold on. Listen to this shit. Okay.
[2454.68s -> 2463.43s]  I'll see you guys on Tuesday. We will do Later Alligator because that's what pre-stream chat
[2463.43s -> 2468.92s]  voted on. Sorry, I'm only here for like three and a half hours. I kind of planned on only
[2468.92s -> 2473.82s]  streaming for like three or four hours today just because of how I felt yesterday. I had a good time.
[2473.82s -> 2477.42s]  That was a lot of fun. A dinosaur game was fun. That was cool. I thought it was like an interesting
[2477.42s -> 2484.68s]  game. The House of the Dead remake. It was all right. I mean, I think it was a little too intense
[2484.68s -> 2489.64s]  probably. It was, I think, fun. If you had a like on it, I think it would be way better.
[2491.22s -> 2500.86s]  This guy hates streaming. I don't hate streaming. Zit, by the way. I developed a zit from that game.
[2502.14s -> 2509.24s]  I'll see you guys on Tuesday. Thanks for watching. Quick one. I'll be back on Tuesday, Wednesday,
[2510.04s -> 2515.78s]  maybe like Tuesday, Friday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Saturday. We'll see. Whatever. My schedule is
[2515.78s -> 2528.33s]  all over the place, so we'll see. Thank you. Wait, I didn't want to do that immediately. I
[2528.33s -> 2537.72s]  want to do this. There we go. Yeah, we'll rate somebody. Let's see who's live right now.
[2538.36s -> 2566.86s]  Who is currently live? Is Connor live? Yeah, we'll rate Connor. That sounds like a plan. Jesus.
[2570.42s -> 2579.93s]  You can hear that, right? Mouth sounds. Because my noise gate is off. So you guys get to hear like
[2585.30s -> 2588.66s]  yeah, this is why I have a noise gate. This is why all streamers have a noise gate.
[2588.66s -> 2598.09s]  There, I fixed it. Everybody has a noise gate so you don't hear the weird mouth sounds.
[2598.09s -> 2607.82s]  Yeah, like, god damn it. I fucking hate that. You just saw me naked. Okay, let's rate Connor.
[2607.82s -> 2633.98s]  What is Connor doing? What are you up to? Just chatting. Oh, I think Connor's in the process of
[2634.70s -> 2639.10s]  rating, doing a tier list of all the consoles, all the old consoles. That should be pretty
[2639.10s -> 2647.50s]  interesting stuff. Pretty cool. I look forward to his absolutely incorrect opinions on everything.
[2651.64s -> 2655.75s]  All right, I'll see you guys on Tuesday. Thanks for watching. Bye. Take care of yourselves.
[2656.39s -> 2670.14s]  Call your mother. Mother's Day, especially. Take care of yourselves. Good night and goodbye.
