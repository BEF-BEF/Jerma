[12.15s -> 15.35s]  God damn it, I didn't write a title. Fuck. Oops.
[16.90s -> 20.50s]  I was so busy getting here and turning the stream on that the title is just Amusements.
[20.50s -> 22.00s]  It's a- that's the worst title.
[22.80s -> 23.90s]  It's gotta be something better than that.
[25.92s -> 29.82s]  Quick, quick, before the Vaude can- can make the- seal it and keep it there.
[29.82s -> 33.22s]  What's a great- what's a good- uh, it's Thrillville off the rails.
[36.38s -> 37.58s]  Is Amusements fine?
[39.95s -> 42.85s]  I mean, it's really boring, but does it get the point across? Maybe.
[47.99s -> 50.09s]  On at the park. I think that's even worse.
[52.63s -> 53.93s]  Hold on, hold on, beer back.
[89.21s -> 94.35s]  Somebody else had this problem, where you have a normal night's sleep.
[95.15s -> 97.95s]  There's nothing weird about your sleep, it's just a kind of a normal night.
[99.20s -> 105.90s]  But for some reason you wake up, and it- it's like you're- you're living in another dimension.
[107.04s -> 109.74s]  Just everything's so groggy, the world is in slow motion.
[111.99s -> 115.39s]  Like your head, like my eyes feel like they're in somebody else's head.
[117.83s -> 118.63s]  Why does this happen?
[119.70s -> 120.50s]  What happened today?
[121.86s -> 122.96s]  That's every single morning.
[124.99s -> 126.59s]  Any doctors in here dehydrated?
[126.59s -> 127.69s]  No, I drink a lot of water.
[129.14s -> 132.34s]  I always, before bed, and it kind of depends on the night.
[133.34s -> 138.34s]  But I will always, before going to sleep, drink at least an eight ounce glass of water.
[138.34s -> 140.74s]  Just like, just drink it, and put it down.
[142.10s -> 143.30s]  Usually over the course of a few minutes.
[145.52s -> 147.02s]  Your breathing is being obstructed?
[151.76s -> 152.36s]  Drink water.
[153.56s -> 155.96s]  What about- yeah, I always have to get up and pee after like four hours.
[155.96s -> 157.26s]  I have pee a lot anyways though.
[158.43s -> 159.33s]  It's caffeine?
[161.81s -> 165.01s]  But I never drink coffee after four or five o'clock in the afternoon.
[165.01s -> 166.91s]  I have a hard, strict cutoff of coffee.
[169.24s -> 170.24s]  Coffee and me?
[171.47s -> 172.97s]  We don't hang out after five o'clock.
[173.77s -> 175.77s]  Six o'clock, maximum, ever.
[177.45s -> 178.65s]  It's all the cigarettes you smoke.
[178.65s -> 179.85s]  I don't smoke cigarettes.
[179.85s -> 181.25s]  My voice just sounds like shit.
[183.70s -> 185.70s]  My voice just sounds like this because I- I don't know.
[185.70s -> 187.80s]  I've had a junky ass voice the last two years.
[187.80s -> 188.40s]  I don't know why.
[192.13s -> 193.03s]  I've been to an ENT.
[193.03s -> 193.83s]  They've looked down there.
[193.83s -> 194.73s]  They go, it looks fine.
[195.23s -> 196.03s]  Everything looks great.
[197.90s -> 200.00s]  Why is my voice such junk sometimes?
[200.00s -> 200.80s]  What's going on here?
[208.18s -> 208.98s]  It's in your head.
[213.69s -> 214.59s]  Your voice is fine?
[214.79s -> 215.59s]  Well, no, no, no.
[215.59s -> 216.89s]  I'm just- it usually is.
[216.89s -> 222.62s]  But sometimes, man, I just- I got these like cysts in my sinuses
[222.62s -> 225.62s]  and I swear to God, even if every doctor has told me like,
[225.62s -> 226.32s]  oh, they're fine.
[226.32s -> 227.12s]  There's nothing wrong with it.
[228.09s -> 231.29s]  Last year or so, man, I get like a blockage in my nose.
[231.29s -> 232.69s]  My voice gets all junky.
[234.27s -> 235.27s]  I've got to get him removed.
[235.47s -> 236.17s]  I got to get him out.
[237.30s -> 239.30s]  I don't even- even if it's elective, just get rid of him.
[240.66s -> 241.56s]  He's called me a bestie?
[241.56s -> 242.16s]  Oh, thanks.
[244.64s -> 246.14s]  What the- what WTF?
[246.14s -> 246.84s]  Why is he alive?
[251.18s -> 253.08s]  I mean, I told you guys are going to be live on Wednesday.
[254.89s -> 256.49s]  Why are you getting your nose removed?
[256.49s -> 258.69s]  No, I'm not getting my- I'm getting- whatever.
[261.06s -> 265.14s]  Today, we're going to play- sorry I was at about five minutes late.
[265.84s -> 266.84s]  Happens.
[268.37s -> 270.07s]  Today, we're going to play Thrillville Off the Rails.
[271.62s -> 273.02s]  Very highly requested game.
[275.26s -> 278.76s]  I remember a long time ago, probably like four- at least three
[278.76s -> 282.10s]  or four years ago, more than that, when I was still making YouTube
[282.10s -> 283.40s]  videos a few times a week.
[284.30s -> 289.23s]  I played this game for, I think, 10 minutes and I was going to
[289.23s -> 292.43s]  make a video on it, but some- I don't know why I didn't.
[294.08s -> 296.88s]  Something in the first 15 minutes of the game made me stop
[296.88s -> 298.08s]  playing and I just never came back.
[298.95s -> 299.45s]  I don't know why.
[303.85s -> 305.75s]  2013 was nine years ago.
[307.29s -> 307.69s]  I know.
[308.19s -> 309.29s]  This game fucks.
[310.58s -> 311.58s]  This game sucks.
[316.02s -> 317.72s]  Fuck, I just got- why did that hurt?
[317.92s -> 320.02s]  Oh God, why am I so old?
[323.40s -> 324.40s]  You can- all right.
[324.80s -> 327.66s]  Let me tell you how you can tell when you're old, or when
[327.66s -> 328.36s]  you're getting older.
[329.62s -> 331.52s]  I just realized something right now.
[333.00s -> 336.30s]  The more that you hear me talk about me going to the doctor
[336.60s -> 340.46s]  and medical issues that I may or may not have, I feel like a
[340.46s -> 343.46s]  lot of our conversations are about me going to the doctor
[343.46s -> 344.16s]  this one time.
[347.34s -> 350.14s]  I remember having conversations with like grandparents.
[350.84s -> 354.14s]  You know, I was at the doctor last night and I'll tell you,
[354.14s -> 357.04s]  I don't think- I'm not entirely sure he understands that
[357.44s -> 358.14s]  my foot hurts.
[358.64s -> 360.14s]  I- I'm doing that to you.
[361.34s -> 362.44s]  And I'm only 36.
[366.03s -> 366.33s]  Yeah.
[370.09s -> 370.49s]  All right.
[370.79s -> 372.89s]  So this is a- this old game.
[372.99s -> 374.79s]  This game came out in like 2006?
[375.69s -> 376.09s]  2007?
[377.31s -> 377.91s]  Classic.
[379.29s -> 380.99s]  There are apparently a lot of mini games that people really
[380.99s -> 381.69s]  want me to play.
[382.59s -> 383.29s]  And I'm gonna play them.
[383.49s -> 384.19s]  I'm gonna go for it.
[385.80s -> 388.20s]  I'm gonna give you guys a little bit of a content plan
[388.20s -> 389.70s]  here now that we're in the new year.
[390.30s -> 393.20s]  By the way, if you've missed the New Year's Eve stream,
[393.70s -> 395.80s]  and I haven't had an opportunity to tell you,
[396.50s -> 398.20s]  Happy New Year, first of all.
[399.83s -> 403.53s]  Last time I streamed was on the 31st into the 1st of the
[403.53s -> 404.03s]  new year.
[406.61s -> 408.81s]  Hey, let's make- let's make this- let's make this a good one.
[410.93s -> 411.93s]  Scrumptious cake.
[413.56s -> 416.06s]  This is the first real stream of 2022.
[417.25s -> 418.55s]  What's my New Year's resolution?
[422.21s -> 422.91s]  I got too many.
[423.11s -> 423.91s]  There are way too many.
[425.02s -> 426.52s]  I have too many New Year's resolutions.
[426.52s -> 428.12s]  It's not even worth telling people what they are.
[430.14s -> 431.54s]  It's not even a New Year's resolution.
[431.54s -> 432.94s]  It's a New Year's grocery list.
[434.43s -> 437.43s]  You don't tell anybody what a grocery list you have is.
[437.93s -> 440.63s]  If you need like three or four items, like I need eggs,
[440.63s -> 442.53s]  I need milk, and I need Doritos.
[442.73s -> 443.63s]  You can tell people that.
[443.93s -> 444.83s]  You can say that to somebody.
[445.81s -> 448.91s]  I don't tell you the entire cart that I have to fill
[449.61s -> 451.11s]  on a weekly or bi-weekly basis.
[452.72s -> 453.42s]  It's way too many.
[458.94s -> 459.64s]  Top three
[460.93s -> 461.83s]  are all top three.
[462.96s -> 465.66s]  All- all 40 of them are in the top three.
[466.56s -> 468.36s]  They're just shoving each other around trying to get into
[468.36s -> 469.06s]  the first spot.
[473.97s -> 474.57s]  Top two?
[479.06s -> 481.26s]  I'll give you- well, no, this is not even a resolution.
[482.55s -> 484.25s]  I want to do- okay.
[485.13s -> 486.03s]  2022.
[490.17s -> 492.27s]  What- who cares?
[492.27s -> 495.07s]  I'm gonna- I can help- I hope to do a little bit more laundry
[495.07s -> 495.57s]  this year.
[496.57s -> 498.97s]  That's a real one, and that might even be number two.
[501.64s -> 502.34s]  Okay, let's go.
[507.59s -> 509.49s]  I need to start doing more laundry.
[509.49s -> 511.69s]  Like I've got to- I've got to do some more laundry this year.
[513.75s -> 516.55s]  I can't just like wait around and like, oh, is this clean?
[516.55s -> 517.15s]  Is it clean?
[517.15s -> 518.15s]  No, I can't do that.
[520.03s -> 520.63s]  It's stupid.
[521.33s -> 522.13s]  It's selfish.
[522.13s -> 524.13s]  It's annoying to like be like, oh, I don't care.
[530.24s -> 533.71s]  And number one is to clean my laundry machine, my washing
[533.71s -> 534.11s]  machine.
[534.71s -> 535.61s]  People forget to do that.
[538.28s -> 540.78s]  Every- every like six months, you should really use one of
[540.78s -> 541.98s]  those machine washing packets.
[545.85s -> 547.55s]  Oh, and I also want this to be the biggest content year
[547.55s -> 548.05s]  I've ever had.
[548.65s -> 550.85s]  Somewhere up there in the top five or whatever.
[551.45s -> 551.85s]  I don't know.
[552.35s -> 552.85s]  Somewhere up there.
[553.83s -> 555.33s]  This game has a theme song.
[557.48s -> 558.48s]  I need to listen to this.
[566.72s -> 567.22s]  Let's hear it.
[569.29s -> 572.79s]  Is this a real song or is this- did they make it for this game?
[579.62s -> 580.72s]  This is a real song?
[584.21s -> 585.71s]  I don't think this is DMCA.
[591.96s -> 593.76s]  I think they made this for Thrillville.
[593.76s -> 595.36s]  This is an original song?
[600.63s -> 603.13s]  It's a perfect day in my amusement park.
[605.28s -> 605.88s]  Be careful, dude.
[605.88s -> 607.88s]  This game is a DMCA landmine.
[607.88s -> 608.88s]  Oh, whatever.
[610.15s -> 611.35s]  This isn't a real song.
[612.90s -> 616.30s]  I got my ticket to ride on my rides in my amusement park.
[616.30s -> 619.20s]  Nobody made this song like on a- on an album somewhere for
[619.20s -> 620.90s]  like just a regular releasing it.
[621.20s -> 622.00s]  This is for this game.
[623.00s -> 625.30s]  All right, I have a- this is very important question for
[625.30s -> 625.90s]  everybody here.
[629.82s -> 631.82s]  First of all, I got a 1440p monitor now.
[631.82s -> 632.32s]  Isn't that cool?
[633.78s -> 634.88s]  All right, shut up for a second.
[635.08s -> 635.68s]  Not you guys.
[636.68s -> 637.68s]  No, I actually like that song.
[640.82s -> 641.02s]  All right.
[641.02s -> 642.92s]  So here's- this is really important.
[644.86s -> 647.76s]  This game has two different graphics settings.
[648.66s -> 652.56s]  One of them is the original, the original PS2 graphics and
[652.56s -> 657.26s]  the other one is the new updated Xbox 360 graphics or
[657.26s -> 657.86s]  something, right?
[659.24s -> 661.64s]  Everybody that I've seen talk about this game talks about-
[663.94s -> 664.64s]  Is this a real song?
[666.74s -> 668.14s]  No, you just spelled Thrillville.
[668.14s -> 670.64s]  This is not a- of course it's an original song.
[672.80s -> 673.90s]  They're saying Thrillville.
[673.90s -> 674.60s]  I'm fine.
[674.70s -> 675.80s]  I'm DMCA fine.
[676.90s -> 678.50s]  All right, so do you want- let's see what it looks like
[678.50s -> 680.20s]  with the- with the new graphics, okay?
[681.74s -> 682.84s]  There's two different graphics.
[682.84s -> 684.44s]  This is the new, updated.
[685.04s -> 685.94s]  You pick a character.
[687.15s -> 687.95s]  That's what they look like.
[693.11s -> 696.11s]  A lot of people said that the old PS2 original models look
[696.11s -> 698.91s]  way better, but we're going to be the judge of that.
[703.57s -> 703.87s]  Okay.
[704.64s -> 706.34s]  So what does it look like with the original models?
[708.60s -> 714.93s]  We might have to do a trade-off here though, because I think
[714.93s -> 717.63s]  it makes all the other stuff worse looking too.
[720.33s -> 722.73s]  The actual park and the environments and the lighting
[722.73s -> 723.33s]  and everything.
[723.33s -> 723.73s]  Let's see.
[728.14s -> 731.14s]  I mean, this is definitely a little more charming, I think.
[734.35s -> 737.13s]  But should we play with the original graphics?
[742.90s -> 743.60s]  Original, original.
[743.70s -> 744.20s]  Do vote.
[744.20s -> 744.60s]  All right.
[744.80s -> 745.60s]  We get a poll up here.
[747.54s -> 750.04s]  Original graphics or updated graphics?
[750.54s -> 751.14s]  Scene two.
[757.71s -> 760.21s]  This is an- how- do they have an entire original album?
[761.15s -> 763.65s]  How come nobody's- has ever said to play this OST?
[768.53s -> 769.53s]  This is the whole album.
[773.44s -> 776.84s]  Whiplash baby on that roller coaster.
[778.34s -> 780.04s]  I- why have I not heard this?
[782.65s -> 783.95s]  This is actually ACDC.
[783.95s -> 785.15s]  This is not ACDC.
[788.37s -> 788.57s]  All right.
[788.57s -> 790.67s]  Well in the meantime, I can just pick a character.
[790.67s -> 790.97s]  All right.
[792.30s -> 793.10s]  Who do I want to play with?
[793.90s -> 796.40s]  This whole game is played in a third-person perspective
[796.40s -> 799.00s]  and you can ride all the rides you make and the rides
[799.00s -> 800.50s]  are not normal.
[801.20s -> 803.10s]  They're like shooting people out of cannonballs and stuff.
[803.20s -> 803.70s]  I don't know.
[806.02s -> 806.82s]  Who do I want to play as?
[808.89s -> 809.29s]  Harry?
[813.66s -> 814.16s]  Thomas?
[816.82s -> 817.42s]  Jasmine?
[818.88s -> 819.28s]  Greg?
[819.78s -> 821.08s]  I kind of- I kind of like Eden.
[825.20s -> 826.00s]  Wait, hold on.
[828.27s -> 828.77s]  Oliver?
[829.07s -> 829.57s]  Bethany?
[830.07s -> 830.67s]  Lane?
[835.10s -> 835.50s]  Jim?
[837.02s -> 837.52s]  Joseph?
[838.62s -> 839.92s]  I kind of like Jessica too.
[841.31s -> 841.91s]  Hmm.
[842.59s -> 843.59s]  I think it's gonna have to be Eden.
[848.15s -> 848.45s]  Eden.
[853.10s -> 854.40s]  Is this just- is this just Ness?
[858.09s -> 858.79s]  All right, appearance.
[858.89s -> 859.49s]  Head style.
[864.63s -> 865.03s]  It's Aaron.
[866.22s -> 868.32s]  Not- I can't do that in 2022.
[870.62s -> 871.42s]  I like this hair.
[872.61s -> 873.21s]  Hair color.
[876.71s -> 878.01s]  No, it's just Lucas.
[880.80s -> 881.80s]  Should we make Lucas?
[882.10s -> 889.72s]  That's fine.
[891.35s -> 892.25s]  All right, what about clothing?
[894.79s -> 896.09s]  I don't think I want to change any of the clothes.
[896.09s -> 896.79s]  I like it like this.
[896.79s -> 897.79s]  It's Bart Simpson.
[897.79s -> 898.59s]  Well, it's whoever.
[903.99s -> 904.69s]  I like this.
[904.69s -> 905.49s]  I don't want to change anything.
[910.81s -> 911.41s]  Edit name.
[914.44s -> 916.34s]  It's not- it's definitely not gonna be Eden anymore.
[917.94s -> 919.64s]  It's definitely gonna have to be Lucas.
[920.71s -> 921.31s]  Lucas.
[928.59s -> 929.79s]  Oh, I'm ready.
[930.66s -> 931.16s]  I'm ready.
[932.89s -> 933.59s]  I could do it.
[934.29s -> 936.59s]  I could do it and I could make a lot of you real mad.
[938.11s -> 938.81s]  I could go for it.
[941.41s -> 942.21s]  Thinking about doing it.
[942.81s -> 946.01s]  Thinking about making everybody very furious the first stream of 2022.
[952.14s -> 953.14s]  No, it's too early.
[953.64s -> 954.34s]  Too early for that.
[956.73s -> 958.03s]  I'll probably do it at some point this stream.
[958.03s -> 959.13s]  I won't be able to contain myself.
[959.13s -> 959.73s]  All right, you ready?
[960.86s -> 962.86s]  We'd have to- does this soundtrack just play the whole game?
[966.35s -> 967.45s]  Original graphics.
[967.45s -> 968.35s]  That's what we're gonna stay with.
[968.35s -> 969.05s]  Sounds good to me.
[969.05s -> 969.65s]  Start the game.
[969.65s -> 970.05s]  Here we go.
[970.05s -> 970.95s]  Three, two, one.
[976.98s -> 977.58s]  Are we little?
[977.58s -> 977.98s]  Are we tiny?
[977.98s -> 979.68s]  Are we like a- I feel like we're as big as mice.
[983.41s -> 984.41s]  Is that what this whole thing is?
[989.80s -> 990.40s]  Yeah, we're like mice.
[990.40s -> 991.30s]  We're as big as little mice.
[999.09s -> 999.89s]  Is this PS2?
[999.89s -> 1002.49s]  This looks really good for PS2 FMV.
[1004.37s -> 1005.07s]  This looks great.
[1015.06s -> 1016.06s]  This reminds me of that guy.
[1016.06s -> 1020.26s]  The guy that was in every Disney movie.
[1021.69s -> 1022.89s]  And he was like this.
[1022.89s -> 1024.39s]  Oh, let me tell you something.
[1024.99s -> 1026.89s]  No, you have to be careful out there.
[1026.89s -> 1027.79s]  He was like the Mad Hatter.
[1028.29s -> 1028.99s]  What was that guy's name?
[1037.15s -> 1038.15s]  He was the Mad Hatter.
[1040.31s -> 1040.81s]  Not Goofy.
[1040.81s -> 1041.11s]  No.
[1042.65s -> 1044.05s]  Not Rick Sanchez.
[1044.05s -> 1044.45s]  No.
[1045.55s -> 1046.35s]  If you know, you know.
[1050.66s -> 1051.86s]  Okay, this is my park.
[1053.46s -> 1058.96s]  I was like, that's dangerous.
[1066.66s -> 1070.06s]  Maybe it's because of the no safety equipment on any of the rides.
[1070.06s -> 1071.56s]  I have a feeling that's why.
[1078.46s -> 1081.16s]  Okay, everything I do is thrills.
[1082.91s -> 1085.01s]  And I can do missions to do more.
[1092.11s -> 1092.91s]  Okay, but wait a minute.
[1092.91s -> 1095.96s]  I own this park and I like ate.
[1101.07s -> 1101.87s]  My stomach is what?
[1104.19s -> 1105.69s]  Oh my God, that's fast.
[1107.98s -> 1108.78s]  Okay, there's a sprint.
[1108.78s -> 1109.38s]  Is there a jump?
[1110.18s -> 1110.78s]  Oh wait, hold on.
[1112.65s -> 1113.55s]  All right, build.
[1115.42s -> 1120.92s]  Now that you're in charge, one of your most important jobs is to build rides and stalls in the park.
[1120.92s -> 1122.22s]  I can build these rides.
[1122.22s -> 1125.42s]  That will make your guests happy and make you the most money.
[1127.28s -> 1130.98s]  Ed Wynn was the laughing guy in Mary Poppins.
[1131.48s -> 1132.28s]  Is that who it is?
[1135.14s -> 1137.14s]  He was always a guy that made toys and shit, right?
[1137.14s -> 1138.34s]  He was always a toys guy.
[1138.34s -> 1140.24s]  Like I'm the toy maker.
[1140.24s -> 1142.14s]  I'm the toy maker.
[1142.74s -> 1143.14s]  Right?
[1147.20s -> 1151.40s]  Now that you're in charge, one of your most important jobs is to build rides and stalls.
[1151.40s -> 1151.80s]  All right.
[1151.80s -> 1155.80s]  These build zones are for cargo rides, games, and stalls.
[1159.00s -> 1164.10s]  Anytime you want to build something, simply walk into one of these zones and press the A button.
[1164.10s -> 1165.00s]  Oh shit, okay.
[1165.00s -> 1166.60s]  How much customization do I have?
[1167.20s -> 1169.90s]  Every attraction requires power in order to run.
[1169.90s -> 1170.40s]  Power?
[1170.40s -> 1174.40s]  This meter shows you how much power each section of your park has left.
[1174.40s -> 1175.40s]  Pay attention to it.
[1175.40s -> 1176.50s]  What if I run out of power?
[1179.41s -> 1183.31s]  Okay, I looked down at the lower left and I thought that was a cryptocurrency.
[1184.44s -> 1185.34s]  I was like, what is that?
[1185.74s -> 1186.54s]  Oh, and then I'm...
[1186.54s -> 1187.44s]  Okay, that's like a...
[1187.44s -> 1188.14s]  That's a euro.
[1190.28s -> 1191.28s]  I was like, what is that?
[1193.86s -> 1196.36s]  The crypto euro.
[1198.60s -> 1199.00s]  All right.
[1199.00s -> 1199.40s]  I get it.
[1199.40s -> 1199.70s]  I get it.
[1199.70s -> 1200.00s]  I get it.
[1200.00s -> 1201.70s]  Can I do USD?
[1203.75s -> 1204.05s]  All right.
[1204.05s -> 1205.05s]  Tank frenzy.
[1206.08s -> 1206.98s]  The first build mission.
[1206.98s -> 1207.18s]  All right.
[1207.18s -> 1208.18s]  We need to build tank...
[1208.18s -> 1209.38s]  Wait, can I build whatever I want?
[1211.49s -> 1212.19s]  Sideshow.
[1212.19s -> 1213.19s]  Test your strength.
[1214.05s -> 1214.95s]  Fucking bowl.
[1216.10s -> 1217.20s]  Wild frontier.
[1220.11s -> 1221.31s]  Oh my god, mini golf.
[1222.49s -> 1223.79s]  Prospector stakeout.
[1224.33s -> 1225.03s]  What do I do?
[1228.22s -> 1229.02s]  I kind of want to do...
[1229.22s -> 1230.82s]  How about Luftwaffe 2?
[1233.57s -> 1234.17s]  What is this one?
[1235.42s -> 1236.82s]  Bandito chinchilla.
[1238.49s -> 1240.79s]  I feel like I heard that name before and I don't know anything about it.
[1241.09s -> 1241.49s]  Stunt...
[1241.49s -> 1241.69s]  All right.
[1241.69s -> 1242.19s]  How about this?
[1242.49s -> 1243.29s]  Test your strength.
[1244.82s -> 1245.72s]  Oh wait, I have to build...
[1247.48s -> 1248.98s]  Okay, for the tutorial I have to do...
[1251.08s -> 1251.48s]  Where is it?
[1252.69s -> 1253.09s]  What happened to it?
[1255.08s -> 1255.98s]  Where is it?
[1255.98s -> 1256.38s]  What happened?
[1259.16s -> 1259.66s]  Where is it?
[1259.66s -> 1260.06s]  There it is.
[1261.46s -> 1261.86s]  What happened?
[1265.77s -> 1266.67s]  I can't select any of these.
[1268.72s -> 1269.32s]  Should I just back out?
[1273.25s -> 1273.95s]  He's a loser.
[1275.48s -> 1275.88s]  Bandito...
[1275.88s -> 1277.38s]  I can't select any of these.
[1281.00s -> 1281.90s]  Oh, wait, what?
[1283.11s -> 1285.51s]  Oh, I have to build tank frenzy.
[1285.51s -> 1286.21s]  I have to.
[1286.21s -> 1288.41s]  I thought it was just saying that you could build tank frenzy
[1288.41s -> 1289.31s]  if you wanted to.
[1292.82s -> 1294.02s]  Okay, so spin it around.
[1294.22s -> 1295.12s]  Does it matter where it is?
[1300.14s -> 1300.94s]  I guess I'll put it right here.
[1303.98s -> 1304.58s]  Oh shit.
[1304.58s -> 1304.98s]  All right.
[1304.98s -> 1305.38s]  It's ready.
[1305.38s -> 1306.78s]  Let's talk about roller coasters.
[1309.11s -> 1312.71s]  To build one, select coaster from the build menu or walk up to...
[1312.71s -> 1314.01s]  Can I actually build coaster?
[1314.01s -> 1314.91s]  And take it from there.
[1314.91s -> 1315.71s]  Oh, nice.
[1315.71s -> 1316.41s]  I'll be there to help.
[1317.59s -> 1318.39s]  Oh, hell yeah.
[1319.48s -> 1319.98s]  Hell yeah.
[1319.98s -> 1324.48s]  And you'll just love some of the crazy new wall coaster pieces I'm designing.
[1325.48s -> 1328.88s]  These coasters do things that people never thought possible.
[1329.68s -> 1330.48s]  Amazing, huh?
[1332.87s -> 1334.97s]  Are people going to die on this stream?
[1335.99s -> 1336.89s]  I hope not.
[1338.20s -> 1343.80s]  After you've placed down attractions, don't forget to paint and style them to look just the way you want them to.
[1343.90s -> 1345.30s]  Oh, I can customize even more.
[1346.82s -> 1347.42s]  Okay, cool.
[1347.52s -> 1348.22s]  So I can build.
[1349.28s -> 1350.28s]  Build tutorial complete.
[1350.38s -> 1352.88s]  Now then, make your way over to another column of light.
[1353.18s -> 1354.48s]  I'll catch up with you there.
[1354.48s -> 1354.88s]  Okay.
[1359.23s -> 1359.63s]  All right.
[1359.83s -> 1360.53s]  Manage.
[1361.45s -> 1364.45s]  Your park is in good shape when two things are healthy.
[1364.75s -> 1366.55s]  Guest happiness and profit.
[1367.16s -> 1370.96s]  You can use your cash to build new rides, hire staff, and run promotions.
[1370.96s -> 1374.76s]  When you charge the right prices, your park value will soar.
[1375.36s -> 1380.96s]  The park menu helps you manage the big picture by giving you lots of useful information about your park.
[1382.67s -> 1384.57s]  Your name is Jeremy, laugh out loud.
[1385.11s -> 1386.01s]  What the hell's your name?
[1386.31s -> 1387.41s]  Like, Greg?
[1387.51s -> 1388.21s]  Who cares?
[1389.36s -> 1390.86s]  Why is that such a funny thing?
[1393.43s -> 1394.63s]  Is this just a name?
[1394.83s -> 1395.73s]  It's just a name.
[1397.10s -> 1400.20s]  The overview screen shows a summary of the guests in your park.
[1400.60s -> 1402.60s]  It can help you see what your guests want.
[1402.80s -> 1405.50s]  And the happier they are, the more money you'll earn.
[1405.50s -> 1406.20s]  Make people happy.
[1406.20s -> 1413.60s]  Use the park upgrade screen to research new rides, or start a marketing campaign to attract more guests, or even take out a loan.
[1414.30s -> 1420.50s]  In park information, you'll find all kinds of useful charts that can help you see how your park changes over time.
[1421.61s -> 1426.71s]  And finally, in Thrillville stats, you can see your greatest products from all your parks.
[1427.71s -> 1429.61s]  Let's start the first manage mission.
[1429.71s -> 1430.21s]  Manage.
[1430.41s -> 1431.11s]  It's time to think big.
[1431.11s -> 1434.91s]  Let's create a great advertising campaign that will have people flocking to Thrillville.
[1434.91s -> 1437.41s]  Don't forget to put the ads where everyone can see them.
[1439.58s -> 1455.13s]  Alright, so we go to Teen Monthly, Daily Gossip, Parenting for Success, The National Newspaper, Witch Mansion, The Kiddy's Channel, Toon's TV, The Know-It Channel, or T-
[1455.13s -> 1455.93s]  Alright, what's cheap?
[1458.04s -> 1458.54s]  I'm not blowing-
[1458.54s -> 1459.44s]  Let's just Teen-
[1459.74s -> 1460.44s]  Teen Monthly.
[1462.55s -> 1463.05s]  That's fine.
[1463.05s -> 1463.85s]  Well done.
[1463.85s -> 1464.75s]  I don't want to spend a bunch of money.
[1464.75s -> 1467.85s]  Remember, the park menu helps you decide how you want to manage the place.
[1468.05s -> 1468.35s]  Cool.
[1468.35s -> 1470.85s]  It shows you what you've done, and what you can do.
[1476.19s -> 1477.69s]  Alright, we're almost through the tutorial.
[1477.79s -> 1478.29s]  Halfway.
[1479.12s -> 1479.92s]  Okay.
[1480.12s -> 1481.82s]  Now, head over to any other-
[1483.83s -> 1485.23s]  I'm so ready to play.
[1485.96s -> 1486.76s]  I can't wait.
[1488.01s -> 1488.51s]  We need to-
[1488.51s -> 1489.51s]  I need to know these things.
[1489.51s -> 1491.31s]  I know, tutorial, resident sleeper.
[1491.31s -> 1492.11s]  Just relax.
[1493.65s -> 1494.15s]  Don't worry.
[1496.85s -> 1498.05s]  You can talk to anyone.
[1501.13s -> 1501.63s]  What?
[1502.63s -> 1503.93s]  I can talk to anybody in the park.
[1507.33s -> 1508.53s]  I can just chat with people?
[1510.23s -> 1511.13s]  Alright, that's cool.
[1513.23s -> 1515.03s]  I can put them on the spot for trivia?
[1519.93s -> 1520.43s]  What?
[1523.93s -> 1524.63s]  Wait, hold on.
[1525.03s -> 1526.23s]  What do you mean, matchmaking?
[1526.33s -> 1529.98s]  I can put people in the park on dates?
[1535.65s -> 1537.05s]  It's a dating sim?
[1537.95s -> 1538.45s]  No.
[1543.06s -> 1543.86s]  Alright, here we go.
[1544.16s -> 1544.86s]  How do we do this?
[1545.86s -> 1546.66s]  Alright, here we go.
[1547.27s -> 1547.97s]  How do we do this?
[1548.27s -> 1550.75s]  Go talk to somebody.
[1550.75s -> 1552.25s]  Go talk to Sammy Dowie.
[1552.55s -> 1554.81s]  Hey, Sammy!
[1555.61s -> 1556.11s]  Hi.
[1559.91s -> 1562.51s]  So, I thought that car was just gonna run him over.
[1562.51s -> 1564.81s]  I thought the back truck back there was just gonna kill us.
[1565.11s -> 1566.10s]  Okay.
[1566.90s -> 1567.80s]  Okay, no.
[1568.53s -> 1569.33s]  What do you mean, no?
[1572.89s -> 1574.59s]  That's not a place for children to be.
[1578.01s -> 1578.91s]  Alright, what do you-
[1578.91s -> 1579.71s]  What do you needs?
[1580.01s -> 1583.47s]  Alright, they like gentle and mild rides.
[1584.20s -> 1585.40s]  They have to go to the bathroom.
[1585.88s -> 1586.78s]  Very badly.
[1588.60s -> 1589.80s]  They're pretty happy.
[1591.68s -> 1592.38s]  Alright, so you hung-
[1592.38s -> 1593.28s]  I need to build some stuff.
[1593.48s -> 1593.88s]  What should you-
[1593.88s -> 1594.68s]  Can I give him a gift?
[1596.25s -> 1596.75s]  Trivia.
[1608.53s -> 1609.03s]  Okay.
[1614.72s -> 1616.52s]  What is it, breathing in gas fumes?
[1617.51s -> 1618.41s]  What- who cares?
[1627.95s -> 1629.15s]  The grosser the better.
[1629.76s -> 1630.36s]  We're- we're-
[1630.36s -> 1631.96s]  I'm making a good friend right now.
[1634.35s -> 1638.65s]  The United Kingdom got its first female Prime Minister in 1979.
[1639.86s -> 1642.06s]  She must have been really excited to get the job.
[1643.15s -> 1644.15s]  Oh, wow, we're friends.
[1644.15s -> 1644.85s]  Okay, what's the-
[1644.85s -> 1645.55s]  What- what-
[1645.55s -> 1646.95s]  Do you know the home run record?
[1646.95s -> 1647.95s]  Wait, what about just chatting?
[1649.83s -> 1650.73s]  We saw Piranha at the zoo.
[1650.73s -> 1651.33s]  They were awesome.
[1651.33s -> 1652.63s]  We saw Piranha at the zoo.
[1652.73s -> 1653.96s]  Awesome.
[1654.40s -> 1655.50s]  Those things scare me.
[1655.60s -> 1657.30s]  Okay, a lot of you guys are like question marking and going-
[1657.50s -> 1660.00s]  If you've ever heard two kids talk to each other,
[1660.00s -> 1661.40s]  this is exactly what they do.
[1662.51s -> 1664.71s]  They're just little weird factoid machines
[1664.91s -> 1665.91s]  of things that they know.
[1666.01s -> 1667.21s]  This is exactly how it goes.
[1669.96s -> 1674.66s]  They just say a sentence of something that they know or found out today
[1675.06s -> 1675.76s]  to each other.
[1676.37s -> 1677.67s]  I don't think they're even listening to each other.
[1686.78s -> 1687.58s]  Didn't like that.
[1689.18s -> 1689.98s]  Didn't like that.
[1691.35s -> 1691.95s]  Lemonade.
[1692.15s -> 1695.05s]  I heard the guy who did Whiplash is playing Lemonade this summer.
[1695.75s -> 1697.65s]  You have a lot of skills for such a little kid.
[1703.12s -> 1703.62s]  So what-
[1704.22s -> 1704.82s]  How long do I-
[1704.82s -> 1706.12s]  Squadron Ace?
[1706.12s -> 1707.22s]  Have you played Squadron Ace?
[1707.22s -> 1708.12s]  The end boss is huge.
[1708.12s -> 1709.52s]  Have you played Squadron Ace?
[1709.72s -> 1711.22s]  The end boss is huge.
[1711.99s -> 1714.19s]  I haven't tried it yet, but maybe I will soon.
[1714.19s -> 1714.59s]  This is-
[1714.59s -> 1715.39s]  That's disgusting to me.
[1715.39s -> 1715.59s]  This is-
[1715.59s -> 1716.69s]  That's an M rated game.
[1717.32s -> 1718.02s]  Who bought you that?
[1718.63s -> 1719.53s]  Who bought you that game?
[1719.63s -> 1720.43s]  You shouldn't be playing that.
[1721.57s -> 1723.37s]  Hey, spring training starts soon.
[1723.67s -> 1725.27s]  Baseball season is almost here.
[1725.77s -> 1727.37s]  Baseball is my favorite sport.
[1727.47s -> 1728.37s]  Okay, liked that a lot.
[1728.37s -> 1728.67s]  What just-
[1728.67s -> 1729.87s]  What happens when we get all the way up?
[1730.73s -> 1731.73s]  Oh, have you played Tank Frenzy?
[1731.73s -> 1732.33s]  I just made it.
[1732.63s -> 1735.93s]  For all-out action, you should check out the Tank Frenzy arcade game.
[1736.92s -> 1739.02s]  That car back there is freaking me out.
[1739.02s -> 1740.42s]  I feel like this is gonna land on everybody.
[1740.52s -> 1742.82s]  I haven't tried it yet, but maybe I will soon.
[1743.49s -> 1744.69s]  Doesn't this kid have to go to the bathroom?
[1748.58s -> 1750.48s]  It went from 62 to 67.
[1750.98s -> 1753.08s]  What's with all those talk radio stations?
[1753.28s -> 1754.68s]  Play some music already.
[1754.98s -> 1755.48s]  I know.
[1755.68s -> 1759.38s]  More music, less talk.
[1759.48s -> 1760.78s]  It's important to eat a healthy diet.
[1760.78s -> 1762.08s]  Now, kids don't want to-
[1762.08s -> 1762.38s]  No.
[1763.28s -> 1765.28s]  We have an old cat that loves to sleep in my bed.
[1765.28s -> 1767.68s]  We have an old cat that loves to sleep on my bed.
[1769.56s -> 1770.76s]  Okay, that's enough!
[1770.96s -> 1772.16s]  That's enough little Lucas!
[1772.46s -> 1774.86s]  Now come over here and let me show you the candy machine!
[1774.86s -> 1776.76s]  Like, how long is it gonna go on for?
[1777.16s -> 1778.26s]  Cats are so annoying.
[1778.36s -> 1779.86s]  Why would you let a kid run this place?
[1783.60s -> 1784.60s]  You don't like cats? Why?
[1784.70s -> 1785.20s]  What?
[1785.67s -> 1788.07s]  Our school has a really great marching band.
[1788.17s -> 1792.08s]  I can't wait to join my school's marching band.
[1792.38s -> 1794.08s]  I just want to see what happens when you get to the last-
[1794.18s -> 1795.88s]  the second bar there.
[1795.88s -> 1796.58s]  You all want to know.
[1796.58s -> 1797.18s]  We need to know.
[1797.68s -> 1799.08s]  You should try Stunt Rider.
[1799.28s -> 1800.78s]  It's a great new arcade game.
[1802.30s -> 1803.80s]  I chatted at another park.
[1804.10s -> 1805.00s]  It was pretty good.
[1805.10s -> 1807.20s]  Alright, can we please be best friends?
[1807.60s -> 1808.60s]  Seafood is really great.
[1808.60s -> 1809.50s]  I love to eat fish.
[1809.70s -> 1811.10s]  Seafood is really great.
[1811.30s -> 1813.00s]  I love to eat all kinds of fish.
[1813.00s -> 1814.30s]  My dad catches fish.
[1814.60s -> 1816.40s]  My mom cooks it, and I eat it.
[1816.60s -> 1817.60s]  It's a great system.
[1818.36s -> 1819.46s]  Okay, we're almost there.
[1820.45s -> 1821.85s]  Haven't even asked, how are you yet?
[1822.05s -> 1822.85s]  How are you?
[1822.95s -> 1824.95s]  I have to go wheelie real bad.
[1825.45s -> 1825.95s]  Shit!
[1828.89s -> 1830.79s]  Why are all the rides always broken?
[1830.79s -> 1831.59s]  Who's fixing them?
[1831.59s -> 1833.29s]  Isn't that me talking shit about my own place?
[1834.76s -> 1836.56s]  If you had to go on our mini cold dogs,
[1836.56s -> 1837.86s]  I hate cold hot dogs.
[1837.86s -> 1839.26s]  I hate cold hot dogs.
[1840.25s -> 1841.55s]  Cold hot dogs are the worst.
[1841.55s -> 1842.45s]  Yep, we agree with that.
[1842.45s -> 1842.95s]  Alright.
[1845.16s -> 1845.76s]  Whiplash.
[1845.86s -> 1847.66s]  Have you heard the latest smash hit, Whiplash?
[1847.66s -> 1849.26s]  Have you heard the latest smash hit?
[1849.56s -> 1850.26s]  Whiplash is-
[1850.26s -> 1851.46s]  I'm a huge fan of that.
[1851.46s -> 1852.36s]  Alright, now we're best friends.
[1852.36s -> 1853.36s]  I even have the ringtone.
[1854.22s -> 1855.12s]  Good friends.
[1855.42s -> 1856.19s]  Good friends.
[1856.19s -> 1856.69s]  Alright.
[1856.89s -> 1858.65s]  Now go- go on, get out of here.
[1858.75s -> 1864.25s]  Bows can throw up.
[1864.55s -> 1865.95s]  They expel their stomachs,
[1866.15s -> 1868.85s]  use their forearms to dig out the stomach's contents,
[1869.05s -> 1870.65s]  and then swallow the stomach again.
[1870.65s -> 1871.15s]  Ew!
[1872.19s -> 1873.19s]  She hates me now.
[1873.49s -> 1874.19s]  I'm sorry.
[1874.49s -> 1874.99s]  See?
[1875.09s -> 1876.79s]  That was fun, wasn't it?
[1876.99s -> 1881.19s]  Talking to people is going to tell you a whole lot about how well your park is doing.
[1885.02s -> 1885.52s]  Okay.
[1886.02s -> 1887.02s]  Tutorial complete.
[1889.44s -> 1891.04s]  Just two more columns of light now.
[1891.34s -> 1892.04s]  Pick either one.
[1892.34s -> 1894.44s]  Alright, upkeep and then- wait, there's games too.
[1894.44s -> 1895.24s]  Alright, upkeep.
[1896.51s -> 1897.61s]  Upkeep, upkeep, staff.
[1897.61s -> 1899.91s]  Your staff will keep things running while you're busy with other projects.
[1900.21s -> 1902.41s]  They keep Thrillville in tip-top shape.
[1902.41s -> 1902.91s]  Okay.
[1902.91s -> 1904.91s]  Mechanics fix and maintain riots.
[1904.91s -> 1907.11s]  Groundskeepers keep the garbage under control.
[1907.21s -> 1907.51s]  Yep.
[1907.51s -> 1909.61s]  And entertainers cheer up the crowds.
[1909.61s -> 1910.31s]  Entertainers.
[1911.04s -> 1913.34s]  Staff will start working as soon as you hire them.
[1913.34s -> 1914.54s]  Do much better with training.
[1914.54s -> 1915.64s]  Do much better with training.
[1915.64s -> 1917.15s]  Okay.
[1917.25s -> 1918.75s]  Please find the gambling minigame.
[1918.75s -> 1920.05s]  And training is a hands-on situation.
[1920.25s -> 1924.75s]  You'll help your staff get more efficient by pitching in and showing them how it's done.
[1924.95s -> 1925.45s]  Okay.
[1925.55s -> 1931.12s]  To hire, train, and fire staff, go to your park menu and select staff.
[1931.32s -> 1933.62s]  Let's start the first upkeep mission.
[1933.62s -> 1934.22s]  Crowd pleaser.
[1934.22s -> 1939.72s]  Shake your groove thing by performing Thrillville's Stuntz new theme song with the park's cheerleaders.
[1940.02s -> 1942.72s]  It's good exercise and an even greater way to promote the song.
[1945.27s -> 1946.57s]  Watch the success gauge.
[1946.87s -> 1948.97s]  It indicates how satisfied the crowd is with your performance.
[1948.97s -> 1950.57s]  If it drops to zero, it's game over.
[1954.00s -> 1955.87s]  Hey, oh God crap.
[1957.02s -> 1964.18s]  It's, it's an Xbox controller and you know, I'm going to mess it up because X is Y and Y is, you know what I mean?
[1965.14s -> 1965.74s]  All right, let's go.
[1972.53s -> 1973.03s]  Wait, what?
[1974.10s -> 1974.70s]  Oh shit.
[1974.70s -> 1975.10s]  Okay.
[1986.92s -> 1987.62s]  This is a real song.
[1987.62s -> 1989.72s]  Do they make this for Thrillville?
[1996.83s -> 1998.03s]  I feel like this is a real song.
[2003.51s -> 2004.71s]  I can't, I don't know.
[2004.71s -> 2006.61s]  We just wait, do they say Thrillville in the song?
[2008.17s -> 2008.67s]  Listen up.
[2015.79s -> 2017.19s]  Thrillville, right?
[2018.26s -> 2019.16s]  This is a real song.
[2025.26s -> 2027.16s]  Is it a, it's a real, this is a real song.
[2029.85s -> 2031.15s]  Oh, whatever.
[2039.64s -> 2040.34s]  Goodbye.
[2040.44s -> 2041.54s]  This is the last scream.
[2041.94s -> 2043.64s]  I don't think this is, I don't think so.
[2044.04s -> 2044.34s]  Okay.
[2045.55s -> 2046.05s]  I don't think so.
[2051.50s -> 2052.70s]  This is Miley Cyrus.
[2055.61s -> 2056.51s]  Why do I look so sad?
[2060.52s -> 2061.22s]  All right, I get it.
[2061.62s -> 2063.32s]  So we're not going to ever do the cheerleading missions.
[2070.81s -> 2071.41s]  All right, cool.
[2074.76s -> 2076.06s]  Now you're starting to get it.
[2076.26s -> 2078.06s]  Even the work at Thrillville is a game.
[2078.46s -> 2080.26s]  And now you also see how we.
[2081.06s -> 2082.06s]  All right, final one.
[2082.06s -> 2085.26s]  We're almost ready to begin our play through of Thrillville.
[2085.76s -> 2086.86s]  Welcome to the game.
[2091.77s -> 2095.27s]  Many of your jobs will involve playing games and riding the rides.
[2095.67s -> 2096.37s]  Yes, I know.
[2096.37s -> 2097.87s]  It's tough being a park manager.
[2097.87s -> 2103.17s]  You can play every game and ride every ride yourself by walking up to it and pressing the A button.
[2103.17s -> 2104.27s]  Every single ride.
[2104.27s -> 2106.07s]  And then selecting play from the context menu.
[2106.07s -> 2107.07s]  Can I ride my own rides?
[2107.27s -> 2108.97s]  Let's try the first games mission.
[2109.17s -> 2110.47s]  All right, we'll play stunt rider.
[2111.53s -> 2115.63s]  You can perform spectacular stunts in the air, but try to land on your back wheel.
[2117.68s -> 2120.77s]  Celebrate, lean, reverse, horn.
[2121.07s -> 2122.17s]  Previous music track.
[2122.17s -> 2124.19s]  God, lean.
[2124.19s -> 2124.79s]  All right, whatever.
[2129.35s -> 2131.15s]  Why did this just turn into like a Newgrounds game?
[2140.74s -> 2141.34s]  Big air.
[2142.14s -> 2142.84s]  Slow down, slow down.
[2147.52s -> 2148.22s]  All right, I get it.
[2148.22s -> 2148.42s]  I get it.
[2148.42s -> 2148.92s]  This is cool.
[2151.38s -> 2152.18s]  Don't land on your head.
[2152.78s -> 2154.38s]  Oh, I missed the star.
[2154.38s -> 2154.78s]  It's all right.
[2157.83s -> 2158.33s]  Level two.
[2158.33s -> 2158.83s]  All right, let's go.
[2163.28s -> 2163.98s]  Oh!
[2168.03s -> 2168.63s]  This is fun.
[2168.63s -> 2168.93s]  All right.
[2168.93s -> 2169.73s]  I got to be careful.
[2170.64s -> 2171.54s]  Don't go too fast.
[2173.00s -> 2173.50s]  Oof.
[2174.30s -> 2174.90s]  That was bad.
[2177.88s -> 2178.38s]  Slow down.
[2179.08s -> 2180.98s]  Yeah, there's a game like the trials, right?
[2184.87s -> 2186.37s]  I was always so bad at these.
[2193.32s -> 2194.42s]  I was awful at these games.
[2194.42s -> 2194.92s]  Always.
[2196.36s -> 2198.86s]  The trials games was such a huge thing on YouTube.
[2199.96s -> 2200.96s]  Back in the YouTube days.
[2201.36s -> 2202.26s]  I never played them.
[2202.26s -> 2203.66s]  I never made a video on them.
[2203.66s -> 2205.06s]  I don't think because I just couldn't do it.
[2205.46s -> 2206.36s]  I was embarrassing.
[2206.36s -> 2207.56s]  I think I maybe there was one.
[2207.96s -> 2208.86s]  I think there's one.
[2209.16s -> 2209.86s]  Give me a break.
[2210.26s -> 2218.25s]  No!
[2221.69s -> 2222.29s]  Get up there.
[2230.58s -> 2231.68s]  Is this happy wheels?
[2233.08s -> 2234.38s]  No, this is not happy wheels.
[2235.38s -> 2236.28s]  I never played that either.
[2238.60s -> 2239.90s]  Oh, I didn't play that for another reason though.
[2239.90s -> 2240.70s]  I just don't know.
[2240.70s -> 2241.60s]  I didn't want to play it.
[2242.30s -> 2243.70s]  And not because I didn't think I was good at it.
[2252.02s -> 2252.42s]  Did I do it?
[2252.42s -> 2252.82s]  Is it?
[2258.12s -> 2259.62s]  I feel like this is made in a little big planet.
[2264.88s -> 2265.18s]  All right.
[2265.18s -> 2266.08s]  I'm so bad.
[2269.55s -> 2270.15s]  Cry.
[2270.55s -> 2271.05s]  Cry.
[2275.78s -> 2276.78s]  It was made in flash.
[2276.78s -> 2278.88s]  I'm sure a lot of these probably were.
[2279.38s -> 2280.18s]  Are these mini games?
[2280.18s -> 2281.18s]  Are there a lot of them like this?
[2284.47s -> 2285.47s]  How many games are in the game?
[2287.98s -> 2289.68s]  Dude, your little big planet screen sucked.
[2290.28s -> 2291.88s]  I didn't, I never streamed little big planet.
[2291.88s -> 2292.38s]  What are you talking about?
[2296.10s -> 2297.80s]  I've never streamed a little big planet.
[2307.61s -> 2308.21s]  Slow down.
[2313.43s -> 2313.83s]  There it is.
[2313.93s -> 2314.33s]  All right.
[2315.23s -> 2315.63s]  Nice.
[2318.24s -> 2319.14s]  You did.
[2319.14s -> 2320.14s]  You literally did.
[2320.14s -> 2321.94s]  When did I stream little big planet?
[2323.34s -> 2324.74s]  Did four years ago?
[2326.64s -> 2327.34s]  No, I didn't.
[2334.00s -> 2334.80s]  You forgot.
[2334.80s -> 2337.40s]  I have never played little big planet on stream.
[2337.60s -> 2338.30s]  Not a chance.
[2343.50s -> 2344.80s]  It was in 2015.
[2346.90s -> 2347.70s]  I did not.
[2353.30s -> 2353.80s]  Here we go.
[2358.70s -> 2359.30s]  It's time.
[2362.56s -> 2373.96s]  If Rick talked like this, would half of you guys like the show now?
[2380.60s -> 2381.00s]  All right.
[2383.71s -> 2385.91s]  I said, why is there an event horizon happening?
[2388.86s -> 2389.16s]  All right.
[2389.16s -> 2390.96s]  I now am the park manager.
[2393.99s -> 2399.09s]  I want to talk to, let's talk to Olivia Edwards.

[2562.17s -> 2563.37s]  What kind of a ride is this?
[2566.94s -> 2569.44s]  Was it shooting people in like a military scenario?
[2569.44s -> 2570.14s]  What's going on?
[2572.31s -> 2573.71s]  This is a fucked up ride.
[2584.32s -> 2585.92s]  It's a very fun ride.
[2588.33s -> 2588.73s]  Oh wait, no.

[2884.55s -> 2885.05s]  Not that high.
[2885.15s -> 2885.85s]  65 maybe.
[2897.63s -> 2898.03s]  Do it.

[3075.47s -> 3085.13s]  What am I trying to vacuum puke off the ground?
[3088.85s -> 3094.47s]  Oh, this would be so screwed up.

[3216.51s -> 3217.61s]  It only gives 7500.

[3280.11s -> 3281.71s]  Sam, I need to talk to you, Sam.
[3282.21s -> 3282.61s]  Hello.

[3284.95s -> 3285.45s]  Thanks a lot.
[3285.45s -> 3286.15s]  Appreciate that.
[3287.52s -> 3288.12s]  Okay.

[3294.70s -> 3295.90s]  You should ask her out.
[3296.30s -> 3296.80s]  Who?
[3297.10s -> 3297.90s]  I don't think so.
[3299.26s -> 3300.36s]  I don't think I've met anybody.
[3303.04s -> 3304.64s]  I really hate whining customers.
[3304.74s -> 3305.34s]  Yeah, don't you?
[3305.34s -> 3306.54s]  I don't like people whining.
[3307.78s -> 3309.38s]  I just heard an explosion.
[3315.71s -> 3316.51s]  What's happening?
[3316.71s -> 3317.11s]  Why?
[3317.31s -> 3317.61s]  Why?
[3317.61s -> 3318.41s]  What's going on?
[3318.41s -> 3319.41s]  What was your worst?
[3320.96s -> 3323.06s]  I think I made bandito chinchilla cry.
[3323.26s -> 3324.26s]  Oh, okay.
[3324.26s -> 3325.36s]  People are talking about that one.
[3326.97s -> 3327.57s]  It's really funny.
[3327.57s -> 3328.17s]  Don't you think so?
[3329.67s -> 3330.77s]  Advertise the game.
[3331.07s -> 3332.37s]  It is an awesome game.
[3332.37s -> 3333.67s]  Bandito is my hero.
[3333.97s -> 3334.17s]  All right.
[3334.17s -> 3334.87s]  We're almost friends.
[3336.94s -> 3338.04s]  I challenge you.
[3338.24s -> 3339.64s]  And I'm here to prove it to you.
[3339.84s -> 3340.64s]  Challenge you to what?
[3340.74s -> 3342.44s]  You have no idea what you're in for.
[3342.54s -> 3343.34s]  Let's play.
[3344.04s -> 3345.24s]  What did I just challenge him to?
[3346.40s -> 3346.60s]  Okay.
[3346.60s -> 3348.40s]  I thought that said Thrillville fumes.
[3350.00s -> 3350.40s]  What do you mean?
[3350.40s -> 3353.40s]  Like we get what we're going to breathe out of a paint can together.
[3353.70s -> 3354.60s]  What are you talking about?
[3354.60s -> 3355.80s]  I thought it said fumes.
[3358.84s -> 3359.24s]  Okay.
[3361.52s -> 3362.72s]  Prospector putt.
[3363.22s -> 3364.22s]  Which one should I challenge him to?
[3371.46s -> 3372.16s]  The flumes?
[3374.30s -> 3375.60s]  I don't know how to play bandito.
[3379.29s -> 3380.19s]  Prospector putt.
[3381.31s -> 3381.81s]  All right.
[3381.91s -> 3383.41s]  Judge the power of your shot carefully.
[3383.41s -> 3385.21s]  Sometimes a soft shot is better than a hard one.
[3386.73s -> 3389.03s]  Shoot flyby scores blimp.
[3390.34s -> 3390.84s]  Blimp.
[3393.11s -> 3393.31s]  All right.
[3393.31s -> 3394.51s]  Sam got four on this one.
[3396.30s -> 3396.70s]  Okay.
[3397.20s -> 3397.60s]  Let's go.
[3400.72s -> 3401.52s]  How hard do I have to hit it?
[3406.13s -> 3408.23s]  I don't even that's 50% power.
[3409.06s -> 3409.76s]  Holy shit, Sam.
[3409.76s -> 3411.06s]  You got five on this?
[3411.06s -> 3411.36s]  What?
[3411.36s -> 3412.16s]  You are awful.
[3412.66s -> 3414.66s]  Well, an eight-year-old is going to show you how to play this game.
[3417.00s -> 3417.50s]  Okay.
[3418.62s -> 3419.62s]  This is greased up.
[3419.92s -> 3421.32s]  Somebody greased it up before I got here.
[3426.13s -> 3426.83s]  I still beat him.
[3427.53s -> 3428.73s]  You got four on the next one too.
[3428.73s -> 3429.73s]  Wow, pathetic.
[3441.44s -> 3442.34s]  So what if I win?
[3445.54s -> 3446.84s]  Do one full power swing.
[3446.84s -> 3447.74s]  I want to beat this guy.
[3447.94s -> 3448.34s]  I don't know.
[3448.34s -> 3449.04s]  I don't know what it does.
[3451.29s -> 3451.69s]  Okay.
[3451.89s -> 3452.49s]  Four.
[3452.69s -> 3454.59s]  I think this kid only gets four.
[3463.44s -> 3465.04s]  Oh my God.
[3465.24s -> 3466.24s]  Come on.
[3467.74s -> 3468.84s]  That would have been awesome.
[3474.96s -> 3475.66s]  Get in there.
[3480.65s -> 3481.25s]  Straight ahead.
[3481.25s -> 3481.45s]  All right.
[3481.45s -> 3482.25s]  This should be a hole-in-one.
[3485.86s -> 3486.36s]  Hole-in-one.
[3488.48s -> 3488.98s]  Oh.
[3495.00s -> 3495.30s]  All right.
[3495.30s -> 3496.50s]  I'm currently winning by a lot.
[3498.94s -> 3499.64s]  What does this one look like?
[3500.71s -> 3501.01s]  All right.
[3501.01s -> 3502.41s]  We're going off this wall hard.
[3506.44s -> 3506.84s]  Whatever.
[3508.40s -> 3508.70s]  Whatever.
[3508.70s -> 3508.90s]  Whatever.
[3508.90s -> 3509.20s]  Whatever.
[3511.99s -> 3512.59s]  Let's get it up there.
[3516.76s -> 3517.46s]  It doesn't matter.
[3518.62s -> 3521.52s]  You guys understand that I can literally just swing and miss five times.
[3521.52s -> 3522.32s]  I'm still in first place.
[3524.43s -> 3524.93s]  It doesn't matter.
[3527.44s -> 3528.14s]  You got four again.
[3529.42s -> 3529.92s]  It's this one.
[3531.42s -> 3531.72s]  All right.
[3532.02s -> 3533.32s]  Through the tunnel.
[3534.48s -> 3535.28s]  Into the saloon.
[3535.98s -> 3536.68s]  I'm just going to go hard.
[3541.68s -> 3543.28s]  I don't think you can't get a hole-in-one on this one.
[3552.02s -> 3553.12s]  Do it with your eyes closed.
[3555.69s -> 3556.09s]  No.
[3558.39s -> 3559.39s]  I bet you can't get a birdie.
[3560.19s -> 3560.39s]  All right.
[3560.39s -> 3562.09s]  If I get a birdie on this one.
[3562.59s -> 3563.59s]  What are you going to do for me?
[3563.89s -> 3564.39s]  What do I get?
[3565.84s -> 3567.44s]  Figure it out because it's about to happen right now.
[3575.00s -> 3576.30s]  You don't think I still have confidence that I can do it?
[3582.97s -> 3583.17s]  Okay.
[3583.17s -> 3586.07s]  Actually, I got to be careful because I can't screw this up because now I'm in trouble.
[3586.87s -> 3587.47s]  Oh, no.
[3590.58s -> 3590.98s]  Uh-oh.
[3592.68s -> 3593.08s]  How many?
[3593.08s -> 3593.38s]  What am I?
[3593.38s -> 3594.08s]  How ahead am I?
[3600.51s -> 3600.91s]  Okay.
[3601.21s -> 3601.91s]  How ahead am I?
[3602.94s -> 3603.84s]  I can't screw this up.
[3613.57s -> 3614.67s]  It's going to be close after this.
[3616.86s -> 3617.46s]  Sink that.
[3620.05s -> 3620.45s]  All right.
[3622.02s -> 3622.92s]  I'm still fine.
[3622.92s -> 3623.52s]  I got five.
[3623.52s -> 3625.02s]  I'm five strokes ahead of him at this point.
[3626.16s -> 3627.96s]  I would have to literally just throw for fun.
[3636.28s -> 3637.08s]  What do I get for that one, huh?
[3637.76s -> 3638.36s]  What do I get for that one?
[3638.96s -> 3639.76s]  You going to give me some of that?
[3650.04s -> 3651.04s]  Now it's just BM time.
[3659.76s -> 3660.86s]  I can't even BM.
[3661.26s -> 3661.86s]  I just win.
[3666.55s -> 3667.65s]  Is that too hard?
[3667.75s -> 3668.05s]  Yep.
[3673.24s -> 3674.54s]  So what do I get for BM?
[3674.54s -> 3674.94s]  Okay.
[3677.60s -> 3678.80s]  What do you actually get for doing this?
[3689.55s -> 3690.85s]  You get its pride?
[3691.94s -> 3692.84s]  Battle results.
[3695.05s -> 3696.15s]  He's not going to be mad at me, right?
[3698.63s -> 3699.93s]  Thanks for a great contest.
[3700.13s -> 3700.73s]  You're welcome.
[3701.57s -> 3702.07s]  Wow.
[3703.00s -> 3703.40s]  All right.
[3703.80s -> 3708.46s]  Friends has a new puppy so cute.
[3708.56s -> 3709.66s]  Oh, I know what happened.
[3710.06s -> 3712.26s]  He just let me win because I'm seven years old.
[3713.46s -> 3713.96s]  Right.
[3713.96s -> 3715.96s]  I hate dogs because they're too noisy.
[3716.26s -> 3716.66s]  Okay.
[3716.66s -> 3717.26s]  I get it now.
[3720.28s -> 3722.48s]  Your posse seems so cool and close-knit.
[3722.48s -> 3724.78s]  Your posse seems so cool and close-knit.
[3725.86s -> 3727.16s]  These explosions, man.
[3727.36s -> 3728.16s]  I don't like these.
[3728.16s -> 3728.66s]  Wow.
[3728.86s -> 3729.46s]  Thank you.
[3730.86s -> 3731.66s]  Oh my God.
[3731.66s -> 3732.56s]  Somebody's dead.
[3733.26s -> 3734.16s]  What happened?
[3734.46s -> 3735.66s]  What happened over there?
[3735.96s -> 3738.06s]  I think my cell phone just started ringing.
[3739.06s -> 3739.36s]  It's like,
[3741.56s -> 3742.26s]  like text, text.
[3745.00s -> 3746.30s]  My phone's blowing up right now.
[3746.50s -> 3747.40s]  I got to get over there.
[3747.40s -> 3747.90s]  I have to go.
[3747.90s -> 3748.60s]  I got to get over there.
[3750.88s -> 3752.18s]  Holy, what happened?
[3756.69s -> 3758.19s]  Did you do anything fun last weekend?
[3760.40s -> 3762.90s]  Last weekend, my family and I went to my cousin's wedding.
[3764.34s -> 3764.74s]  Okay.
[3767.66s -> 3769.16s]  What about, um, let's go.
[3769.16s -> 3769.66s]  I'm friends.
[3769.66s -> 3770.56s]  We can gossip.
[3774.34s -> 3776.04s]  How about Teen Monthly?
[3776.24s -> 3778.64s]  HG Crop really has it out for drill though.
[3779.08s -> 3781.38s]  You read her a review of the park in Teen Monthly?
[3782.28s -> 3783.38s]  Another explosion.
[3783.58s -> 3785.58s]  That review deserved a Pulitzer Prize.
[3786.38s -> 3787.78s]  What do you, wait, what do you mean?
[3788.18s -> 3793.25s]  My God.
[3794.25s -> 3796.15s]  I don't know what's happening on that ride.
[3796.45s -> 3799.25s]  But I think a mechanic needs to go check it out because
[3800.12s -> 3802.32s]  that's not, I don't think that's, that's not good.
[3806.98s -> 3807.58s]  Oh, yeah.
[3807.78s -> 3810.58s]  Actually, the countless people that are exploding in your car ride.
[3811.08s -> 3811.98s]  It's way too fast.
[3811.98s -> 3814.58s]  It goes 140 miles per hour in a track that's designed
[3814.98s -> 3815.98s]  for about 30.
[3818.29s -> 3819.49s]  It's a little weird, I think, man.
[3820.49s -> 3830.30s]  Will you just be friends with me?
[3833.38s -> 3833.78s]  What do you mean?
[3833.78s -> 3834.78s]  Oh, he's starving.
[3834.78s -> 3837.88s]  I think I got to open up a hunger stall.
[3843.33s -> 3844.53s]  Wait, let's ask him about mini-golf.
[3846.14s -> 3847.74s]  I need help being a mini-golf pro.
[3847.74s -> 3848.94s]  No, trivia.
[3858.94s -> 3859.44s]  Good friends.
[3860.14s -> 3861.64s]  You know how an albatross sleeps?
[3863.98s -> 3866.58s]  They'll soar through the air at 25 miles per hour.
[3866.58s -> 3867.98s]  I'm not a big fan of birds.
[3868.38s -> 3869.28s]  Oh my God.
[3870.42s -> 3874.42s]  April 15 is National Glaze Spiral Ham Day in the United States.
[3874.42s -> 3874.92s]  Okay.
[3875.02s -> 3875.82s]  Ham is great.
[3875.92s -> 3877.82s]  If only because it inspired the hamburger.
[3878.82s -> 3879.02s]  Okay.
[3879.02s -> 3880.52s]  Well, you're not, you're not very bright.
[3881.22s -> 3882.62s]  All right, we're good friends.
[3882.82s -> 3884.12s]  That's all that needs to be said.
[3885.19s -> 3887.49s]  And I just want to let you know that I appreciate our friendship.
[3891.06s -> 3891.86s]  Can I ask you,
[3892.66s -> 3893.66s]  now that we're friends,
[3895.10s -> 3895.90s]  what do you think is a good idea?
[3895.90s -> 3897.30s]  How do you think the park could be improved?
[3898.39s -> 3899.79s]  Where's the food stands, dude?
[3900.19s -> 3900.59s]  Right.
[3901.29s -> 3901.79s]  I got you.
[3901.79s -> 3902.49s]  I hear that.
[3902.49s -> 3903.49s]  I hear that feedback.
[3904.09s -> 3904.69s]  I understand.
[3905.19s -> 3908.19s]  And I understand I say, I thank you for your feedback and criticism.
[3910.88s -> 3912.58s]  I need a food stall immediately.
[3912.98s -> 3913.58s]  Where can I put it?
[3918.98s -> 3920.58s]  I need a food stall right here.
[3922.12s -> 3923.42s]  Carnival ride, game, stall.
[3924.22s -> 3924.72s]  All right.
[3924.82s -> 3928.42s]  Balloon stall, coffee stall, fizzy, hat, ice cream, pizza, pizza stall.
[3931.28s -> 3932.08s]  Get it right here.
[3934.64s -> 3935.34s]  Fizzy entrance.
[3935.92s -> 3936.52s]  Right there.
[3938.86s -> 3939.56s]  Everybody get out of the way.
[3942.25s -> 3942.65s]  All right.
[3943.65s -> 3944.45s]  Pizza stall.
[3945.86s -> 3946.46s]  Play?
[3949.92s -> 3950.12s]  All right.
[3950.12s -> 3950.82s]  How much is pizza?
[3953.04s -> 3953.34s]  All right.
[3953.34s -> 3954.14s]  Pizza's dollar?
[3954.24s -> 3955.04s]  No, don't think so.
[3955.04s -> 3955.94s]  It's like four bucks.
[3957.37s -> 3958.17s]  Three dollars for pizza.
[3960.48s -> 3961.18s]  How do you play?
[3961.18s -> 3962.48s]  Do I actually make the pizza?
[3965.10s -> 3966.70s]  You want to play vendor tender?
[3970.52s -> 3974.12s]  Rebound your shots off the walls if you haven't got a straight shot.
[3979.11s -> 3979.51s]  All right.
[3981.95s -> 3982.35s]  What?
[3984.37s -> 3985.57s]  Oh, it's just bust a groove.
[3985.57s -> 3986.37s]  Whatever, bust a move.
[3994.29s -> 3995.69s]  I gotta chain it together, right?
[3998.36s -> 3999.26s]  Eight times multiplier.
[4001.16s -> 4002.26s]  I'm like, what?
[4002.56s -> 4002.96s]  No.
[4009.12s -> 4009.62s]  Big chain.
[4012.01s -> 4013.51s]  This is a Rugrats voice actor.
[4015.51s -> 4015.91s]  Is it?
[4020.89s -> 4021.89s]  It actually might be.
[4022.09s -> 4022.69s]  I think you got it.
[4028.59s -> 4029.19s]  All right, chain it.
[4029.89s -> 4030.29s]  There it is.
[4031.09s -> 4031.49s]  Thank you.
[4034.07s -> 4035.57s]  Do you get anything for doing this?
[4035.77s -> 4037.77s]  Or is it just the thing that you can do for fun in the park?
[4043.16s -> 4043.76s]  Oh, come on.
[4047.12s -> 4048.02s]  Put your cam on.
[4049.14s -> 4049.74s]  I don't know.
[4050.14s -> 4050.94s]  I don't think not today.
[4051.14s -> 4051.94s]  Maybe in like a half hour.
[4052.04s -> 4052.54s]  Maybe in a minute.
[4053.52s -> 4055.42s]  I will put my webcam on and maybe a half hour.
[4058.12s -> 4060.52s]  That is that's um, that's Phil and Lil, right?
[4060.52s -> 4061.32s]  Phil and Lil, right?
[4069.34s -> 4070.64s]  You're already here on bottom left.
[4076.64s -> 4078.14s]  I want to, I want to do it.
[4078.14s -> 4079.94s]  I want to do the, I can't though.
[4079.94s -> 4081.44s]  That's a 2021 thing.
[4093.02s -> 4093.22s]  What?
[4093.22s -> 4093.62s]  Okay.
[4093.62s -> 4099.46s]  Why is that such a, what's with like the like manager trope of
[4099.46s -> 4102.40s]  like, why all, why do managers have to be like this?
[4104.10s -> 4105.80s]  Are you lucky you haven't been fired yet?
[4108.40s -> 4111.00s]  Like why, why are they all such, why are they all such shitty people?
[4117.98s -> 4120.88s]  I think management, you got to make sure that your employees are fucking happy.
[4122.75s -> 4123.05s]  Right?
[4124.35s -> 4125.45s]  Why is it like this?
[4134.74s -> 4136.64s]  I think there are some managers that do, do it right.
[4147.40s -> 4148.20s]  Yes, some do.
[4149.62s -> 4149.92s]  I don't know.
[4149.92s -> 4154.22s]  I just don't, you got to like, you can't just be a fucking dick.
[4154.92s -> 4161.98s]  Like God, please.
[4172.49s -> 4179.07s]  Managers can be, unfortunately, easy on Jerma.
[4179.07s -> 4180.37s]  He's never had a real job.
[4182.01s -> 4184.01s]  What do you mean be easy on me?
[4187.99s -> 4189.59s]  What do you mean I've had a real job?
[4189.59s -> 4190.39s]  What are you talking about?
[4194.55s -> 4195.65s]  Assistant managers.
[4196.35s -> 4196.95s]  What did you say?
[4197.15s -> 4197.45s]  What did you say?
[4197.45s -> 4197.95s]  I'm going to read that.
[4198.55s -> 4201.88s]  Assistant managers tend to be the good ones.
[4206.07s -> 4206.87s]  I can't fire anymore.
[4206.87s -> 4207.27s]  What happened?
[4209.46s -> 4209.76s]  Here we go.
[4212.55s -> 4214.95s]  I forgot I was watching this live and I tried to skip this boring part.
[4217.57s -> 4218.97s]  I'm just doing a mini game.
[4219.07s -> 4220.57s]  I'm gaming right now.
[4224.34s -> 4224.64s]  All right.
[4224.64s -> 4226.04s]  I don't want to do this anymore.
[4226.04s -> 4227.14s]  I don't want to do this anymore.
[4229.56s -> 4231.46s]  I have like two hours remaining.
[4231.46s -> 4234.16s]  That's I have the entire runtime of the lower the rings in the top, right?
[4234.66s -> 4235.76s]  I don't want to do this anymore.
[4247.26s -> 4247.76s]  Skip it.
[4247.76s -> 4248.86s]  I'm doing well though.
[4248.86s -> 4250.26s]  Look at how much I'm making a lot of money.
[4250.26s -> 4251.66s]  I think I don't know what this is for.
[4257.94s -> 4258.54s]  I'm just going to lose.
[4259.80s -> 4260.20s]  No, I'm not.
[4260.30s -> 4261.40s]  This is I can change together now.
[4262.20s -> 4262.70s]  Check this out.
[4280.26s -> 4280.56s]  All right.
[4280.66s -> 4281.16s]  I lost.
[4284.10s -> 4284.30s]  All right.
[4284.30s -> 4285.70s]  So I got that I'm ready.
[4286.30s -> 4287.10s]  I want to make a ride.
[4287.10s -> 4288.10s]  I want to build a ride.
[4288.10s -> 4289.00s]  This is the space over here.
[4289.00s -> 4289.50s]  What should I do?
[4291.18s -> 4291.48s]  What's that?
[4294.11s -> 4295.31s]  I got 15 grand.
[4295.41s -> 4296.11s]  How much money do I have?
[4296.11s -> 4296.71s]  All right, let's go.
[4297.78s -> 4298.48s]  Carnival ride.
[4300.57s -> 4300.97s]  Build.
[4302.10s -> 4302.80s]  Oh, whoa.
[4304.28s -> 4305.18s]  Light Fiesta.
[4305.38s -> 4306.08s]  Head metal.
[4306.82s -> 4307.82s]  Head over heels.
[4308.56s -> 4309.86s]  Rotorvation.
[4310.36s -> 4311.16s]  Supercell.
[4311.66s -> 4312.86s]  Turbo prop.
[4314.49s -> 4315.59s]  I build a roller coaster.
[4316.69s -> 4317.19s]  Maybe not yet.
[4317.96s -> 4319.26s]  I think I probably have to unlock it.
[4321.73s -> 4323.13s]  This one's really high nausea.
[4327.26s -> 4328.76s]  I thought that was 48 minute duration.
[4331.49s -> 4333.39s]  You can move to the next vill.
[4335.09s -> 4339.74s]  Again, how do I move to the next vill?
[4341.60s -> 4343.50s]  Go finish your existing coaster.
[4344.18s -> 4345.38s]  Oh, is that the one that's hurting people?
[4351.05s -> 4351.25s]  All right.
[4351.25s -> 4351.75s]  What do I do?
[4354.12s -> 4354.62s]  Crick out.
[4354.62s -> 4355.02s]  Ride.
[4355.02s -> 4355.62s]  Manage.
[4358.16s -> 4358.96s]  Real day edit.
[4360.66s -> 4361.26s]  Edit track.
[4363.01s -> 4363.51s]  Okay.
[4364.99s -> 4366.59s]  Oh, it does just go into the air.
[4369.22s -> 4370.62s]  It doesn't end.
[4377.75s -> 4378.55s]  What is whoa?
[4382.20s -> 4383.00s]  What is this?
[4383.40s -> 4384.40s]  This fire?
[4385.20s -> 4386.10s]  A stunt jump.
[4400.12s -> 4400.82s]  How do I stop it?
[4408.28s -> 4408.58s]  How do I?
[4408.58s -> 4409.28s]  I don't understand.
[4409.28s -> 4409.98s]  How do I like?
[4411.34s -> 4411.74s]  Hit B.
[4411.74s -> 4412.24s]  Hit B.
[4414.46s -> 4415.06s]  Is that actually?
[4415.06s -> 4416.26s]  Wait, did I actually edit it?
[4416.94s -> 4418.24s]  I think I edited this track.
[4430.76s -> 4430.96s]  Where's my?
[4430.96s -> 4431.36s]  Where is it?
[4438.16s -> 4438.66s]  Holy shit.
[4438.66s -> 4439.26s]  That was cool.
[4444.60s -> 4445.30s]  Double jump.
[4448.84s -> 4449.34s]  Okay.
[4449.64s -> 4449.94s]  All right.
[4449.94s -> 4450.54s]  I have to get in there.
[4450.54s -> 4451.24s]  So sorry.
[4451.24s -> 4451.94s]  Anybody rides this.
[4452.04s -> 4452.74s]  Nobody ride this.
[4452.74s -> 4453.24s]  Nobody ride it.
[4453.24s -> 4453.74s]  Nobody ride it.
[4458.51s -> 4459.81s]  I made it go right into the wall.
[4459.81s -> 4460.01s]  All right.
[4460.01s -> 4460.51s]  Delete this.
[4464.62s -> 4465.22s]  Zoom this out.
[4467.27s -> 4467.37s]  All right.
[4467.37s -> 4469.37s]  Maybe I should just do track assist and just have it help.
[4470.88s -> 4472.78s]  If you'd like to track assist to help you at this point.
[4472.78s -> 4472.88s]  Yeah.
[4472.88s -> 4473.88s]  I didn't even start this.
[4474.98s -> 4480.50s]  Oh, what?
[4480.70s -> 4481.10s]  Yes.
[4481.10s -> 4482.00s]  I'd like to use that.
[4483.20s -> 4483.80s]  You've succeeded.
[4483.80s -> 4485.60s]  Completed track 72 thrill.
[4487.52s -> 4488.62s]  I didn't even start this one.
[4488.62s -> 4490.12s]  So I, of course, I'm just gonna let it get finished.
[4490.12s -> 4490.32s]  All right.
[4490.32s -> 4491.92s]  So now people can actually ride this and not die.
[4495.84s -> 4496.44s]  Very cool.
[4496.44s -> 4496.84s]  All right.
[4499.64s -> 4500.54s]  Saddlesville.
[4503.49s -> 4504.19s]  I got to build my own.
[4504.19s -> 4504.39s]  Yeah.
[4504.39s -> 4506.09s]  I need to, I need to plot a land where I can build my own.
[4508.30s -> 4508.90s]  Who are these people?
[4509.10s -> 4509.80s]  Hello.
[4510.44s -> 4510.74s]  Hello.
[4510.74s -> 4511.24s]  Hi there.
[4511.91s -> 4512.31s]  Hi there.
[4512.31s -> 4514.51s]  Crashes in thrillville are like candy.
[4514.81s -> 4515.91s]  Only sweeter.
[4517.48s -> 4518.58s]  Samuel Jackson.
[4522.14s -> 4525.94s]  They're having a steel cage match when wrestling comes to the local coliseum.
[4525.94s -> 4526.74s]  Wait, there's wrestling?
[4527.14s -> 4530.14s]  I like to go to the matches and yell arm bar.
[4530.14s -> 4531.44s]  Put him in an arm bar.
[4537.44s -> 4539.14s]  Happiness loneliness.
[4539.64s -> 4540.54s]  This is very odd.
[4542.30s -> 4545.80s]  So he's incredibly happy, but he is peak loneliness.
[4547.50s -> 4549.70s]  Isn't he here with like an entire family?
[4552.88s -> 4553.18s]  What?
[4554.43s -> 4555.93s]  But he's really happy.
[4556.63s -> 4558.53s]  I can't stand it when the park is messy.
[4558.83s -> 4560.53s]  No one likes a messy park.
[4562.37s -> 4565.27s]  I once had an African great parrot named salty Joe.
[4565.57s -> 4567.47s]  I found him while walking down the street.
[4568.07s -> 4568.47s]  What?
[4568.47s -> 4571.17s]  Great parrots have a lot of special needs in their heart.
[4575.32s -> 4576.42s]  Just want to insult this person.
[4580.37s -> 4583.27s]  I need to find a plot of land that I got $14,000.
[4588.21s -> 4589.41s]  I'm going to a different Ville.
[4591.30s -> 4592.20s]  Go to HQ.
[4592.90s -> 4594.30s]  Oh, I can't you said I could.
[4595.53s -> 4596.23s]  Would you lie to me?
[4602.54s -> 4605.54s]  Wait, the lower the lonely bar, the more lonely they are.
[4606.73s -> 4607.73s]  Oh, that's kind of confusing.
[4610.08s -> 4610.88s]  Keep walking.
[4614.40s -> 4616.10s]  Well, I have to walk to the other parks.
[4616.10s -> 4617.70s]  Why can't I just ride the train?
[4625.45s -> 4627.35s]  Wait, I it's I'm just here.
[4627.95s -> 4630.05s]  Why would I need to drive the train five feet?
[4632.42s -> 4633.02s]  Poster.
[4636.17s -> 4636.77s]  I get to build it.
[4637.67s -> 4638.27s]  Oh hell.
[4638.27s -> 4639.47s]  Yeah, let's go coaster.
[4645.21s -> 4646.01s]  Where's the coaster?
[4652.26s -> 4653.36s]  Prospector stakeout.
[4653.66s -> 4654.76s]  Oh, that's one of those shooting games.
[4654.76s -> 4655.16s]  That's cool.
[4657.05s -> 4657.95s]  I have to build it.
[4658.55s -> 4658.95s]  All right.
[4659.05s -> 4659.95s]  Carnival ride.
[4663.92s -> 4664.62s]  Use the carnival ride.
[4664.62s -> 4666.52s]  I don't think I've unlocked roller coaster yet guys.
[4670.76s -> 4671.56s]  My rides.
[4676.08s -> 4676.78s]  I have to level up.
[4676.78s -> 4676.98s]  Yeah.
[4676.98s -> 4677.18s]  All right.
[4677.18s -> 4678.28s]  Let me let me I gotta level up.
[4679.69s -> 4680.39s]  I'm very invested.
[4680.39s -> 4680.79s]  Let's go.
[4686.20s -> 4688.00s]  You have to place them at the coaster bits.
[4689.03s -> 4689.43s]  Here.
[4692.74s -> 4694.14s]  You have to do it on the platform.
[4697.44s -> 4698.04s]  Coaster.
[4699.81s -> 4700.81s]  Which met build your own?
[4702.24s -> 4703.54s]  Would you like to begin with a tutorial?
[4705.66s -> 4706.36s]  Advanced coaster.
[4706.36s -> 4708.06s]  Let's cover some advanced techniques.
[4710.08s -> 4712.88s]  I'll show you how to build a coaster by following a design
[4712.88s -> 4714.08s]  that I made myself.
[4715.63s -> 4716.43s]  As we go.
[4716.63s -> 4719.73s]  I'll point out some of the tricks I use when designing coasters.
[4720.13s -> 4721.63s]  I've made a lot of these.
[4721.63s -> 4724.13s]  Your job will be to match your track with the gray one.
[4725.05s -> 4728.45s]  Remember your preview may show many different possibilities.
[4728.45s -> 4728.85s]  Sure.
[4728.85s -> 4730.45s]  I built the starting lift hill for you.
[4730.85s -> 4733.25s]  The most important part of a lift hill is the drop.
[4733.25s -> 4734.25s]  We got a big drop.
[4734.35s -> 4737.25s]  The drop gives your coaster the speed it needs to reach the
[4737.25s -> 4737.85s]  end of the track.
[4738.05s -> 4739.65s]  The longer or steeper the drop.
[4739.75s -> 4743.35s]  I know what I know with thermodynamics is whatever it is.
[4743.35s -> 4746.85s]  I understand aerodynamics green and then place the track.
[4747.42s -> 4753.87s]  All right, so we got to go like this and another piece and
[4753.87s -> 4758.41s]  now create some airtime airtime is when you're lifted from
[4758.41s -> 4758.91s]  your seat.
[4758.91s -> 4761.21s]  It's one surefire way to gain airtime.
[4761.31s -> 4763.81s]  The drop you've just built gives us the smooth the pre
[4763.81s -> 4767.01s]  airtime until good now at the top of the bump.
[4767.11s -> 4767.91s]  We want a level.
[4768.21s -> 4768.81s]  Excellent.
[4768.81s -> 4770.01s]  Now make a steep slope.
[4770.11s -> 4772.21s]  Okay, now flatten the track.
[4772.21s -> 4775.11s]  Another good way of increasing your coasters thrill rating
[4775.31s -> 4777.61s]  is to add whoa coaster pieces.
[4777.71s -> 4778.71s]  Whoa coaster.
[4778.71s -> 4779.91s]  Yep, left bumper.
[4779.91s -> 4783.41s]  Add intensity and fun to your parts like the pendulizer.
[4783.51s -> 4786.81s]  So let's now scroll over to the pendulizer piece and build
[4786.81s -> 4787.01s]  it.
[4787.31s -> 4789.71s]  What would you ever get on this ride for the thrills?
[4789.91s -> 4792.71s]  But when building a coaster, okay, should also try to keep
[4792.71s -> 4797.01s]  a low nausea rating a high nausea rating means some who
[4797.01s -> 4799.01s]  cares refused to get on a ride.
[4799.01s -> 4801.91s]  The secret of low nausea is to keep your coaster turn
[4801.91s -> 4803.31s]  smooth by banking.
[4803.31s -> 4807.01s]  Yeah, banking you bank it to the right a little bit a banked
[4807.01s -> 4810.61s]  turn twists on its side to ease the strain to bank a track
[4810.61s -> 4810.91s]  piece.
[4811.01s -> 4811.51s]  There it is.
[4811.51s -> 4813.91s]  Then use the controls to bank in the opposite direction.
[4814.01s -> 4814.61s]  Try it now.
[4814.71s -> 4817.81s]  Now try making a tight right bank turn when your preview
[4817.81s -> 4819.61s]  turns green place the track.
[4819.81s -> 4820.61s]  Yeah, I know.
[4824.36s -> 4825.06s]  I bank it.
[4831.86s -> 4832.66s]  All right, bank it.
[4832.76s -> 4833.86s]  We're really getting it.
[4834.16s -> 4837.46s]  Now it's time to straighten out the track first nice job.
[4837.56s -> 4841.56s]  Now make a short slope now at a small bump at another short
[4841.56s -> 4843.26s]  set and a final track piece.
[4843.36s -> 4843.86s]  All right, easy.
[4844.76s -> 4845.26s]  Incredibly easy.
[4845.36s -> 4845.66s]  Let's go.
[4845.66s -> 4849.36s]  Coaster remember the secret to it, but after all this is
[4850.64s -> 4851.04s]  let's go.
[4852.99s -> 4854.29s]  I don't want this piece of shit.
[4855.02s -> 4856.32s]  I want to make my own coaster.
[4856.42s -> 4857.12s]  No, I want to build.
[4857.12s -> 4857.32s]  Okay.
[4857.32s -> 4858.02s]  Thank you.
[4859.76s -> 4861.76s]  Pendulizer wagon trail.
[4861.76s -> 4862.76s]  Whoa is high.
[4864.72s -> 4869.21s]  Let's we got hot rod stunt log movie a log flume.
[4872.10s -> 4880.10s]  Pendulizer which I start with wagon trail.
[4881.07s -> 4884.02s]  Wild mine wagon trail.
[4884.02s -> 4884.42s]  Let's go.
[4887.88s -> 4888.18s]  All right.
[4888.18s -> 4889.08s]  How do we start this?
[4891.10s -> 4895.64s]  I'm going to say how much room do I have to work with?
[4899.29s -> 4900.39s]  I think it can either go this way.
[4900.39s -> 4901.29s]  Let's have a go this way.
[4904.72s -> 4904.92s]  All right.
[4904.92s -> 4905.42s]  Let's start it.
[4905.92s -> 4907.12s]  I can do the whole map.
[4907.22s -> 4909.62s]  Well, I have 14,000 pounds.
[4911.31s -> 4912.11s]  I need one of those.
[4912.81s -> 4914.61s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go things.
[4914.61s -> 4915.11s]  You know what I mean?
[4915.11s -> 4915.81s]  How do I put that on?
[4920.84s -> 4928.20s]  How do I put on like the thing TNT alley where I just people
[4928.20s -> 4929.60s]  get on the ride and I just blow them up.
[4933.70s -> 4934.00s]  Okay.
[4934.93s -> 4936.33s]  I need I need the chain lift.
[4936.33s -> 4936.53s]  Yeah.
[4936.53s -> 4937.53s]  How do I get the chain lift?
[4940.76s -> 4941.76s]  Is it part of the whoa?
[4946.34s -> 4947.24s]  It's just automatic.
[4948.58s -> 4948.88s]  Is it?
[4956.18s -> 4956.58s]  Pull it back.
[4956.58s -> 4957.28s]  No, stop it.
[4960.93s -> 4962.53s]  It looks it's automatic.
[4962.53s -> 4962.93s]  All right.
[4972.48s -> 4976.01s]  Okay, that's too much.
[4989.43s -> 4989.93s]  I want to have a go.
[4989.93s -> 4990.53s]  That's what I want.
[5001.92s -> 5002.52s]  This way.
[5003.77s -> 5004.57s]  I'd straighten it out.
[5005.82s -> 5014.80s]  Add a couple explosions and then we're going straight down.
[5017.23s -> 5018.13s]  Oh, wait, wait.
[5018.13s -> 5032.07s]  I can't they smash into a wall.
[5034.21s -> 5040.58s]  Have a go into the church goes right into the graveyard.
[5044.89s -> 5045.79s]  I'm not done yet.
[5051.64s -> 5052.24s]  Now back it up.
[5052.34s -> 5053.24s]  It's going to be a little higher.
[5056.03s -> 5058.93s]  What is this safety alert near too many guests?
[5071.85s -> 5073.05s]  How much is this going to cost?
[5076.41s -> 5077.71s]  I don't have a price for this.
[5080.37s -> 5081.67s]  I've got even afford this.
[5084.70s -> 5085.40s]  Oh, I can.
[5085.40s -> 5085.60s]  Okay.
[5085.60s -> 5086.40s]  I see you on the left.
[5108.09s -> 5108.59s]  I can do that.
[5108.59s -> 5109.39s]  I want to just test it.
[5112.07s -> 5112.27s]  All right.
[5112.27s -> 5113.07s]  Now help me finish it.
[5123.30s -> 5123.70s]  All right.
[5123.70s -> 5126.10s]  Thrill 92 nausea is not even that high.
[5127.12s -> 5127.42s]  I swear.
[5127.42s -> 5128.82s]  I wanted I'm just the first coaster ever.
[5128.82s -> 5129.72s]  I want to see how it works.
[5131.38s -> 5131.58s]  All right.
[5131.58s -> 5132.08s]  Let's write it.
[5134.15s -> 5134.55s]  Here we go.
[5135.63s -> 5136.23s]  It's time.
[5140.58s -> 5141.88s]  Oh my God.
[5142.38s -> 5144.58s]  We're going up on our first coaster in Thrillville.
[5153.64s -> 5154.44s]  That would be scary.
[5154.44s -> 5154.94s]  I like that.
[5154.94s -> 5156.44s]  It pretends like it's going to dump you.
[5161.15s -> 5161.75s]  Not bad.
[5161.95s -> 5163.05s]  I like that first loop.
[5169.28s -> 5169.68s]  Nice.
[5169.68s -> 5170.08s]  All right.
[5170.08s -> 5170.68s]  It's pretty good.
[5173.15s -> 5174.65s]  That's a 92 Thrill.
[5180.77s -> 5181.27s]  I like it.
[5182.36s -> 5182.66s]  All right.
[5182.66s -> 5183.16s]  It works.
[5190.32s -> 5200.87s]  Oh, I think I leveled up the G's.
[5202.92s -> 5204.52s]  I'm going to try to make a nausea coaster.
[5204.52s -> 5205.32s]  That's full 100.
[5208.42s -> 5209.02s]  I just was 10.
[5209.02s -> 5210.22s]  That's my first roller coaster ever.
[5212.25s -> 5213.15s]  New park available.
[5213.15s -> 5214.45s]  New technology available.
[5214.55s -> 5215.75s]  Coaster Tron.
[5219.52s -> 5220.82s]  Thrillville other worlds.

[5240.55s -> 5241.35s]  Explorer.
[5244.05s -> 5244.95s]  Or holiday.
[5246.78s -> 5247.48s]  Which one should I do?
[5251.52s -> 5252.02s]  Giant?
[5254.40s -> 5255.00s]  Other worlds.
[5257.89s -> 5259.29s]  Other worlds is, or coward.
[5259.29s -> 5259.69s]  All right.
[5264.79s -> 5264.99s]  All right.
[5264.99s -> 5265.89s]  Let's go to other worlds.
[5270.22s -> 5270.52s]  Whoa.
[5271.52s -> 5273.12s]  This is a, oh, there's robots.
[5278.16s -> 5281.36s]  Anyway, find out what they're doing in Thrillville and stop them.
[5287.58s -> 5288.48s]  Do they talk?
[5288.78s -> 5291.08s]  Unit 11648.
[5297.34s -> 5299.14s]  Uh, should I make friends?
[5299.34s -> 5300.94s]  I'm a big fan of fast food.
[5301.44s -> 5306.84s]  Unit is only programmed to discuss numerical algorithms in eight hour intervals.
[5308.40s -> 5308.70s]  All right.
[5308.70s -> 5309.40s]  Really cool.
[5310.00s -> 5310.90s]  What are your needs?
[5311.00s -> 5311.90s]  How would you possibly?
[5311.90s -> 5313.40s]  Yeah, I was going to say, hey, you don't have a bladder.
[5313.70s -> 5314.60s]  There's no nausea either.
[5315.37s -> 5317.07s]  We can put these guys upside down a thousand times.
[5317.17s -> 5317.77s]  All right, let's do it.
[5321.62s -> 5324.42s]  Let's put, let's, let's put this shit at its absolute limits.
[5325.87s -> 5327.87s]  I'm going to have the coaster spin in a circle a hundred times.
[5333.74s -> 5334.14s]  What is this?
[5335.94s -> 5337.24s]  Sparkle Island 2.
[5339.42s -> 5340.92s]  Of course I want to play Sparkle Island 2.
[5340.92s -> 5341.62s]  Yeah, do you mind?
[5342.56s -> 5343.76s]  There's a huge line for this ride.
[5348.78s -> 5349.48s]  What is this?
[5354.81s -> 5356.61s]  This is running at a weird frame rate.
[5364.53s -> 5365.63s]  This brings me back.
[5367.27s -> 5369.97s]  Yeah, this is, this is just complete nostalgia bait for all of you guys.
[5370.95s -> 5374.65s]  The reason why I'm playing this is because I know a lot of you grew up with this game and I knew a lot of you were going to be like,
[5374.65s -> 5375.95s]  Oh my God, he's playing Thrillville.
[5377.56s -> 5377.96s]  What is that?
[5385.22s -> 5386.02s]  Is this Super Frog?
[5386.92s -> 5388.32s]  There's a million games that will like this.
[5388.32s -> 5389.12s]  It's not just this one.
[5395.44s -> 5396.64s]  I kind of like this game though.
[5396.64s -> 5397.24s]  This is fun.
[5399.93s -> 5401.33s]  I imagine if he touches you, it's over.
[5407.99s -> 5410.09s]  Make it so people have negative g-force and make them.
[5410.49s -> 5411.99s]  Yeah, I mean, I'm going to try to do something crazy.
[5412.99s -> 5413.79s]  That's my first coaster.
[5413.79s -> 5414.99s]  I got to at least get a minute.
[5417.12s -> 5417.92s]  I'm having fun with this game.
[5420.43s -> 5422.93s]  The diamond jump.
[5426.60s -> 5427.70s]  The character is so floaty.
[5437.88s -> 5439.58s]  Hey, just go play Bubble Bobble.
[5439.58s -> 5441.48s]  I just saved you 40 minutes waiting in line.
[5449.23s -> 5450.23s]  All right, here comes the coaster.
[5451.20s -> 5451.90s]  How much money do I have?
[5451.90s -> 5454.70s]  I only have $2,000, but I only have two grand.
[5454.70s -> 5455.20s]  What?
[5456.13s -> 5457.43s]  Two grand, that's it?
[5459.81s -> 5460.51s]  What happened?
[5463.11s -> 5464.01s]  We're going to jack the prices up.
[5475.60s -> 5477.40s]  Oh, no, I'm kidding.
[5477.40s -> 5477.70s]  I'm kidding.
[5477.70s -> 5478.20s]  It was a joke.
[5478.20s -> 5478.70s]  It was a joke.
[5479.10s -> 5479.60s]  I'm kidding.
[5479.60s -> 5480.00s]  I'm kidding.
[5480.00s -> 5480.70s]  It's $6.
[5480.70s -> 5483.64s]  See, it's $6 again.
[5484.24s -> 5485.44s]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[5485.44s -> 5486.14s]  It was a joke.
[5486.14s -> 5487.44s]  I was making a thing.
[5488.24s -> 5490.24s]  It's not expensive anymore.
[5494.25s -> 5495.15s]  I can put a coaster here.
[5495.15s -> 5495.95s]  I can put a coaster here.
[5495.95s -> 5496.55s]  All right, that's cool.
[5498.20s -> 5499.30s]  Oceanville is that way.
[5500.71s -> 5501.61s]  Let's put some food stalls.
[5505.18s -> 5506.28s]  Balloon stalls.
[5506.78s -> 5507.48s]  All right, coffee.
[5507.88s -> 5508.58s]  Definitely need that.
[5510.28s -> 5511.48s]  Coffee shop right in the corner.
[5514.25s -> 5515.25s]  Prices for the coffee.
[5518.68s -> 5523.13s]  Let's make it $2.50.
[5524.90s -> 5525.80s]  Get some more food here.
[5528.47s -> 5529.57s]  Don't coffee and donuts.
[5531.43s -> 5532.33s]  I think that makes sense, right?
[5533.03s -> 5534.33s]  Coffee and donuts right next to each other.
[5539.60s -> 5541.50s]  $1.50 for a donut.
[5543.63s -> 5544.83s]  All right, coffee, donuts.
[5547.51s -> 5551.97s]  And then maybe like a game or something.
[5552.47s -> 5553.27s]  Yeah, like a little game.
[5555.72s -> 5556.62s]  Robo-K.O.
[5557.84s -> 5558.64s]  Shoot Zone.
[5559.78s -> 5560.18s]  Coconut.
[5560.68s -> 5561.58s]  Space Trampolines.
[5561.58s -> 5563.08s]  That sounds awesome, actually.
[5567.24s -> 5568.04s]  How much does this cost?
[5568.64s -> 5569.44s]  I think I can afford it.
[5570.87s -> 5571.67s]  Space Trampolines.
[5576.04s -> 5577.24s]  And then let's trick it out.
[5579.78s -> 5580.58s]  Space-themed.
[5584.13s -> 5584.83s]  Spaceman.
[5585.23s -> 5585.93s]  Oh, I like that.
[5588.92s -> 5589.32s]  No.
[5590.44s -> 5591.14s]  No, Spaceman.
[5594.96s -> 5595.76s]  How much does it cost?
[5598.20s -> 5598.80s]  $10.
[5602.34s -> 5604.74s]  A space-themed ride in space.
[5604.74s -> 5604.94s]  Yeah.
[5604.94s -> 5606.74s]  Well, this is a space-themed theme park.
[5609.22s -> 5610.42s]  What's that big Pikmin monster?
[5612.38s -> 5613.08s]  What is this thing?
[5622.37s -> 5622.67s]  All right.
[5622.67s -> 5623.17s]  Donuts.
[5623.37s -> 5623.87s]  Coffee.
[5625.16s -> 5626.26s]  Let's go this way.
[5627.61s -> 5628.31s]  Make it $30.
[5628.31s -> 5629.91s]  No one's going to buy it if it's $30.
[5629.91s -> 5630.81s]  That's a bad idea.
[5636.36s -> 5636.66s]  All right.
[5636.66s -> 5637.36s]  Let's put something right here.
[5640.54s -> 5641.24s]  How about a...
[5643.62s -> 5644.72s]  Oh, there's already a couple games.
[5644.72s -> 5646.02s]  Let's do stalls.
[5649.83s -> 5652.13s]  At-stall, pizza, restrooms.
[5652.13s -> 5652.63s]  Here we go.
[5655.35s -> 5656.15s]  Right on the side.
[5656.45s -> 5657.35s]  I think that's a good idea.
[5659.92s -> 5660.52s]  Does it cost money?
[5663.21s -> 5663.71s]  Oh, you can't.
[5663.71s -> 5663.91s]  All right.
[5663.91s -> 5664.21s]  Edit.
[5664.21s -> 5664.51s]  No.
[5667.62s -> 5668.02s]  All right.
[5668.12s -> 5668.62s]  Bathroom.
[5671.70s -> 5674.60s]  I'm just generating income from the other place, right?
[5677.74s -> 5678.44s]  I need merch.
[5680.14s -> 5683.94s]  Pizza, mineral water, balloons.
[5683.94s -> 5684.84s]  I think balloons is cool.
[5685.93s -> 5686.53s]  Put that right here.
[5693.48s -> 5694.08s]  Yeah, I do.
[5697.38s -> 5697.68s]  Oh my God.
[5697.68s -> 5698.98s]  They're all flocking over here to get balloons.
[5698.98s -> 5699.58s]  $50.
[5701.96s -> 5703.06s]  They're all freaking out to come over here.
[5703.76s -> 5704.16s]  Are they?
[5704.16s -> 5704.76s]  What are they doing?
[5707.49s -> 5708.39s]  Oh, they're all getting in line.
[5708.39s -> 5708.69s]  Okay.
[5711.49s -> 5712.39s]  That'll generate some money.
[5714.28s -> 5715.98s]  There's a merch link in bio.
[5719.10s -> 5719.80s]  Astroville.
[5721.60s -> 5721.80s]  All right.
[5721.80s -> 5722.50s]  I'm going to pee my pants.
[5722.60s -> 5723.10s]  I'll be right back.
[5726.33s -> 5727.53s]  See you in two minutes.
[5735.34s -> 5736.54s]  I get to use this one more time.
[5736.54s -> 5738.54s]  This is the last time you're going to see this BRB screen probably.
[5739.14s -> 5740.34s]  Until next Christmas.
[5745.82s -> 5746.52s]  Get a good look at it.
[5746.52s -> 5747.12s]  It's awesome.
[5891.22s -> 5892.12s]  I told you I was going to be quick.
[5893.15s -> 5893.65s]  I am back.
[5903.57s -> 5905.47s]  We're using the fall theme and not the winter theme.
[5911.13s -> 5911.93s]  I like this one a lot.
[5912.72s -> 5913.32s]  I like them all.
[5913.72s -> 5914.52s]  I just kind of picked one.
[5919.61s -> 5921.11s]  Well, you'll hear this again next fall.
[5924.92s -> 5926.82s]  There's going to be more music from Blurred Owl, by the way.
[5927.32s -> 5928.82s]  At least in the probably four or five tracks.
[5929.94s -> 5930.34s]  Coming.
[5932.36s -> 5932.56s]  All right.
[5932.56s -> 5937.78s]  Let's get back to what we were doing.
[5939.09s -> 5939.89s]  What were we doing?
[5942.38s -> 5943.08s]  I have no idea.
[5945.70s -> 5946.20s]  All right.
[5950.43s -> 5950.93s]  Too loud?
[5951.03s -> 5951.63s]  Eh, whatever.
[5953.55s -> 5953.85s]  All right.
[5953.95s -> 5955.85s]  Let me get, let me, let me get nice and comfy here.
[5959.56s -> 5961.46s]  I think, do I, I have to fake like friends with somebody.
[5963.16s -> 5963.46s]  Hey!
[5964.58s -> 5965.08s]  Family!
[5967.64s -> 5968.74s]  I require your attention.
[5969.04s -> 5969.34s]  Mr.
[5969.34s -> 5969.74s]  Brooks.
[5976.16s -> 5976.56s]  Oh.
[5983.12s -> 5984.02s]  What a little shit.
[5986.40s -> 5987.70s]  I challenge you.
[5989.70s -> 5991.10s]  Jim Brooks.
[5992.97s -> 5995.47s]  I challenge you to a game of Warp Speed.
[5998.86s -> 5999.46s]  Good luck.
[6006.02s -> 6007.42s]  Wait, why am I riding on his back?
[6007.42s -> 6007.82s]  What?
[6007.92s -> 6008.52s]  This is weird.
[6008.52s -> 6009.12s]  Oh, no, I'm not.
[6009.12s -> 6009.52s]  Okay.
[6010.35s -> 6010.75s]  What?
[6010.85s -> 6011.65s]  This is weird.
[6011.75s -> 6012.45s]  How do we play?
[6015.04s -> 6015.54s]  What's going on?
[6020.78s -> 6021.48s]  This is weird.
[6022.72s -> 6023.92s]  I don't even know what we're doing.
[6026.51s -> 6027.21s]  I'm just going to copy him.
[6027.71s -> 6028.61s]  I think he knows what he's doing.
[6030.34s -> 6031.64s]  This is up, hold up.
[6035.76s -> 6036.26s]  Okay.
[6037.80s -> 6039.10s]  What the fuck is all this?
[6051.20s -> 6051.50s]  Good.
[6051.60s -> 6051.90s]  All right.
[6051.90s -> 6052.60s]  I just took him over.
[6055.41s -> 6056.01s]  Geez.
[6062.54s -> 6063.44s]  My woe level is pretty high.
[6072.14s -> 6072.34s]  All right.
[6072.34s -> 6072.94s]  I want to get off.
[6073.68s -> 6074.58s]  I want to get off right now.
[6074.58s -> 6076.18s]  There's 25 more seconds left.
[6078.80s -> 6080.30s]  I don't want to play this anymore.
[6084.52s -> 6085.82s]  Where did he go?
[6085.82s -> 6086.72s]  Where is he?
[6094.06s -> 6095.36s]  Oh, spinning.
[6095.36s -> 6096.16s]  I don't like it.
[6096.46s -> 6096.96s]  Okay.
[6097.26s -> 6098.16s]  I think I just lapped him.
[6102.52s -> 6107.56s]  That guy was Toad in Super Mario Kart Bowser level 1.
[6108.32s -> 6110.02s]  You pass that motherfucker every time.
[6111.34s -> 6112.44s]  And so I'm sorry.
[6112.54s -> 6114.24s]  I have to give you a gamer opinion here.
[6114.54s -> 6118.64s]  If you are not lapping Toad in the Super Nintendo Bowser's Castle level,
[6120.08s -> 6121.48s]  just return the game.
[6123.50s -> 6124.40s]  At that point, right?
[6129.92s -> 6130.32s]  All right.
[6130.62s -> 6131.82s]  Add it to my crowd.
[6133.13s -> 6134.93s]  I give Jim a VIP pass.
[6137.19s -> 6137.79s]  What does this do?
[6146.90s -> 6147.40s]  Whoa.
[6148.14s -> 6148.44s]  All right.
[6148.44s -> 6149.04s]  So now what?
[6151.18s -> 6151.88s]  What do you think about the park?
[6156.55s -> 6156.95s]  All right.
[6157.62s -> 6158.42s]  How'd you hear about us?
[6161.21s -> 6161.61s]  All right.
[6164.59s -> 6165.09s]  You should try-
[6165.09s -> 6165.79s]  No, I want to-
[6165.79s -> 6167.89s]  I'm gonna make a coaster that's guaranteed to kill somebody
[6167.89s -> 6168.89s]  and I'm gonna tell him he should ride one.
[6170.05s -> 6170.65s]  I'm gonna stay.
[6172.87s -> 6173.07s]  All right.
[6173.07s -> 6173.97s]  I gotta remember what it says.
[6173.97s -> 6174.37s]  Jim.
[6178.76s -> 6179.36s]  My crowd.
[6180.78s -> 6181.98s]  Molly Noodles.
[6182.78s -> 6184.68s]  Jim Brooks and Sam Lee.
[6184.68s -> 6187.68s]  Sam Lee still has not gone to the bathroom since the very beginning of the game.
[6188.80s -> 6189.50s]  Remember this kid?
[6192.20s -> 6194.40s]  He was looking for a bathroom and he said he was starving.
[6194.40s -> 6195.30s]  That was an hour ago.
[6200.84s -> 6202.04s]  Just fucking unfriend this kid.
[6208.96s -> 6209.26s]  All right.
[6212.92s -> 6213.82s]  Do you even have toilets?
[6213.82s -> 6215.12s]  Yeah, in another park.
[6218.30s -> 6219.40s]  I think this is the only bathroom.
[6221.77s -> 6222.27s]  New mission.
[6222.27s -> 6222.77s]  Robo-
[6222.77s -> 6223.97s]  Oh wait, I have to do missions.
[6223.97s -> 6225.57s]  I completely forgot about missions.
[6226.92s -> 6228.02s]  Oh my God.
[6228.02s -> 6229.42s]  I- This is why I don't have any money.
[6229.42s -> 6229.62s]  All right.
[6229.62s -> 6230.12s]  Guest.
[6230.90s -> 6231.80s]  Robo Love.
[6232.77s -> 6234.37s]  Robots don't understand flirting.
[6234.87s -> 6236.27s]  It messes with their logic circuits.
[6236.27s -> 6244.26s]  Use matchmaking or matchmake mode on a teen you are friends with
[6244.26s -> 6247.26s]  and put some smooth flirtation moves on some of those tinheads.
[6247.26s -> 6249.36s]  Wait, what is- what do you want me to do?
[6254.14s -> 6255.34s]  Do I even have any friends?
[6259.11s -> 6262.75s]  So wait, I'm supposed to introduce two people.
[6269.13s -> 6269.93s]  I don't understand.
[6269.93s -> 6273.93s]  Become good friends with a teenager and then use matchmake mode to flirt with robots.
[6274.53s -> 6279.43s]  I-
[6279.93s -> 6282.03s]  That's a very weird sentence to say out loud.
[6284.18s -> 6284.58s]  Right?
[6286.97s -> 6287.47s]  Okay.
[6288.77s -> 6292.12s]  I can't do that one.
[6294.11s -> 6295.41s]  Robo Losers.
[6296.01s -> 6299.01s]  Nothing fries a robot's circuits faster than losing.
[6299.51s -> 6303.31s]  Challenge every robot you see to play a game and then show them the agony of defeat.
[6303.31s -> 6303.71s]  All right.
[6305.18s -> 6309.18s]  I got to challenge a robot to a game and just- and just- and just- absolutely just wipe the rest.
[6312.74s -> 6313.24s]  How about-
[6314.04s -> 6315.64s]  Nineteen ninety-six eight.
[6328.14s -> 6328.54s]  Okay.
[6329.84s -> 6330.82s]  All right.
[6330.82s -> 6331.32s]  Warp speed.
[6331.32s -> 6332.22s]  I'm not playing that one again.
[6332.22s -> 6333.12s]  Robo KO.
[6333.12s -> 6334.12s]  We're going to beat you at your own game.
[6337.69s -> 6341.49s]  Repeatedly hitting the same part of an opponent's body will cause their armor to fall off.
[6342.99s -> 6344.29s]  So it's up, down, left, right.
[6344.69s -> 6345.89s]  Punches, hooks, block.
[6345.89s -> 6346.89s]  Block is left trigger.
[6346.89s -> 6347.99s]  Uppercuts, right trigger.
[6348.79s -> 6349.09s]  All right.
[6349.09s -> 6350.39s]  Just punch him in the face as hard as I can.
[6350.79s -> 6351.69s]  Choose your boxer.
[6352.78s -> 6354.88s]  Uh, clink, clunk, or clunk?
[6355.38s -> 6355.78s]  Clunk.
[6356.48s -> 6357.38s]  I'm definitely a clunk.
[6357.98s -> 6358.58s]  Oh shit.
[6358.58s -> 6359.28s]  Clunk mirror mash.
[6359.28s -> 6359.68s]  This is bad.
[6371.54s -> 6372.14s]  What's going on?
[6377.13s -> 6377.93s]  I can't even hurt each other.
[6382.77s -> 6383.57s]  I got to get an uppercut.
[6389.31s -> 6389.91s]  No mercy.
[6389.91s -> 6390.41s]  No mercy.
[6390.41s -> 6390.91s]  No mercy.
[6396.56s -> 6397.16s]  No mercy.
[6403.79s -> 6404.69s]  Get that armor off.
[6404.69s -> 6405.29s]  What the hell?
[6405.79s -> 6417.65s]  He's blocking?
[6418.77s -> 6419.27s]  Oh, what?
[6419.27s -> 6420.27s]  You're going to play the game?
[6420.27s -> 6421.57s]  He's going to block in the corner.
[6425.70s -> 6426.10s]  Did I win?
[6429.18s -> 6429.98s]  Yeah, that's an exposed.
[6430.08s -> 6430.68s]  He's exposed.
[6439.43s -> 6440.23s]  Bottom left?
[6441.26s -> 6442.46s]  That's what- that's my moves I'm doing.
[6442.56s -> 6442.96s]  Whoa, wait.
[6442.96s -> 6443.16s]  What?
[6450.67s -> 6451.87s]  I have combos.
[6462.18s -> 6464.18s]  Will you do something besides just sitting in the corner?
[6472.47s -> 6472.77s]  Nice.
[6472.77s -> 6473.17s]  Good work.
[6480.16s -> 6481.06s]  Throw in the towel?
[6482.34s -> 6484.44s]  You talking about- that's what- that's what he should do.
[6486.43s -> 6486.63s]  All right.
[6486.63s -> 6487.13s]  Well, whatever.
[6487.13s -> 6487.53s]  I win.
[6487.53s -> 6489.93s]  I'm going to get that- I'm going to get the fame for it.
[6490.43s -> 6491.43s]  You're killing this guy.
[6492.97s -> 6493.67s]  It's third round.
[6493.67s -> 6494.07s]  It doesn't matter.
[6494.07s -> 6494.67s]  He's done.
[6495.27s -> 6500.87s]  All right.
[6500.87s -> 6501.77s]  I- I'm going to knock him out.
[6513.56s -> 6515.66s]  Just do- I'm going to do that combo over and over again.
[6518.30s -> 6520.00s]  He just never blocks the uppercut, ever.
[6520.60s -> 6521.90s]  He just never blocks it once.
[6523.25s -> 6523.75s]  You're going to stop.
[6523.75s -> 6524.75s]  You've already wiped their ass.
[6525.15s -> 6526.75s]  You've already wiped their- whatever.
[6527.78s -> 6528.58s]  You already-
[6535.44s -> 6536.74s]  I need to get a knockout, right?
[6541.23s -> 6545.53s]  I'm just going to tell you guys right now, if I was ever a boxer, every single competition is going to end in a knockout, even if it's me.
[6546.75s -> 6548.15s]  I'm never going to block a punch.
[6548.65s -> 6549.85s]  I'm just going to go in and just be like-
[6552.65s -> 6554.35s]  I'm just going to swing wildly to windmills and shit.
[6554.35s -> 6555.65s]  I'm just going to try to hit them in the head as hard as I can.
[6556.05s -> 6559.05s]  And even if I get knocked out, I guarantee it'll be a show worth watching.
[6561.01s -> 6564.71s]  Like, I'm just going in there with the hands up and I'm just- I'm just swinging at their face as hard as I can.
[6565.38s -> 6566.18s]  Over and over again.
[6566.18s -> 6570.48s]  And they'll catch me in like a- like a quick little jab to the chin and I'm going down immediately.
[6570.78s -> 6571.38s]  But guess what?
[6572.81s -> 6574.81s]  If I knock them out- oh, I'll knock them out every time.
[6578.65s -> 6580.85s]  And I'll do a bunch of like weird movements and shit, too.
[6582.38s -> 6583.98s]  I would be the worst person to box against.
[6583.98s -> 6585.88s]  You would never be able to do- know what I was going to do next.
[6587.20s -> 6591.50s]  I would do like weird, like, jerk, dancing moves and stuff in the corner.
[6592.00s -> 6592.70s]  I'd get booed.
[6592.70s -> 6594.00s]  People would throw shit at me in the ring.
[6594.20s -> 6595.10s]  I don't- I don't care.
[6603.02s -> 6604.82s]  If I knock them out, I'll knock them out every time.
[6604.92s -> 6605.82s]  Yeah, that's what I mean.
[6605.92s -> 6608.52s]  Like, I'm only going to end fights and knockouts.
[6610.18s -> 6612.88s]  There will never be a scenario where it goes to decision.
[6613.78s -> 6616.58s]  I'm going to be like 4 and 60.
[6618.30s -> 6618.90s]  You know what I mean?
[6619.00s -> 6621.90s]  Like, it's- you'll know what's going to happen when I get on stage.
[6624.59s -> 6625.29s]  Imagine knowing that.
[6625.29s -> 6630.75s]  Imagine knowing that the guy that's in the card next will always end in a knockout.
[6630.75s -> 6631.85s]  You just don't know how.
[6636.55s -> 6637.55s]  That would probably be bad.
[6643.20s -> 6646.20s]  It's always- I wonder how he's going to get knocked out this time.
[6646.80s -> 6653.26s]  You'd be the first mini boss of boxing games?
[6656.56s -> 6657.46s]  Gabby J.
[6661.02s -> 6662.12s]  Yay, yay.
[6671.39s -> 6673.89s]  I'm the guy that everybody just starts cheering.
[6673.89s -> 6677.29s]  And when you're on your second or third beer to rile the crowd up,
[6677.29s -> 6681.19s]  I'm just the clown that comes out and does a bunch of goofy shit and then gets knocked out.
[6682.60s -> 6683.60s]  How barbaric.
[6684.76s -> 6686.56s]  That's not- that's not fun.
[6687.10s -> 6688.50s]  That's barbaric.
[6691.21s -> 6692.61s]  Yeah, like kill him.
[6692.91s -> 6693.91s]  Kill his ass.
[6695.01s -> 6695.91s]  And I like run around the ring.
[6695.91s -> 6697.11s]  I'm like, oh, whoopsie.
[6698.77s -> 6702.87s]  And then the guy just fucking rocks me and I go down for 10 seconds.
[6705.34s -> 6708.34s]  And everyone's just screaming, like spilling their beers all over him and shit.
[6708.34s -> 6710.04s]  That- I don't think that's a bad idea for boxing.
[6717.08s -> 6718.88s]  I would just be- I would just be like a clown.
[6722.02s -> 6722.92s]  Court jester.
[6727.21s -> 6727.81s]  I disagree.
[6727.81s -> 6729.81s]  I'd watch it if it were like old wrestling.
[6732.78s -> 6733.68s]  Don't like pizza?
[6734.18s -> 6735.18s]  Come on, man.
[6736.11s -> 6736.51s]  What do you mean?
[6737.40s -> 6738.20s]  All right, well I won.
[6738.70s -> 6740.00s]  I get my trophy, right?
[6741.24s -> 6742.24s]  That was a thousand bucks.
[6742.94s -> 6744.14s]  Robo losers, awarded.
[6746.38s -> 6747.48s]  I gotta do more of the missions.
[6749.98s -> 6750.68s]  Too expensive.
[6750.68s -> 6751.68s]  What do you- what?
[6751.68s -> 6752.98s]  It's- how much is this?
[6753.08s -> 6753.88s]  All right, fine.
[6754.85s -> 6758.85s]  We'll go on the other strategy and that's make sure it's so cheap that every single person can afford it.
[6759.35s -> 6760.45s]  Everybody can buy it.
[6760.95s -> 6762.85s]  So eventually I'll make a profit.
[6769.10s -> 6770.30s]  You're gonna die in the ring.
[6782.48s -> 6783.68s]  That's not how it works.
[6784.84s -> 6788.74s]  Okay, if a hundred thousand people buy a balloon for 25 cents,
[6789.44s -> 6792.44s]  or if 50,000 people buy a balloon for 50 cents,
[6793.56s -> 6794.46s]  what are you talking about?
[6795.42s -> 6796.12s]  It's the same.
[6805.06s -> 6807.06s]  Put it back to 175, fine.
[6808.98s -> 6809.98s]  It's the same amount of money gained.
[6814.82s -> 6815.42s]  King of math.
[6815.52s -> 6817.12s]  If you sell a hundred thou- okay.
[6817.42s -> 6821.91s]  If you sell a hundred thousand balloons for one cent,
[6823.66s -> 6826.96s]  or you sell 50,000 balloons for two cents,
[6827.60s -> 6829.10s]  you've made the same amount of money.
[6829.10s -> 6830.00s]  It's the same amount.
[6836.94s -> 6837.54s]  I get a dollar.
[6841.19s -> 6843.09s]  What do you have cost per pollu- balloon?
[6844.99s -> 6845.89s]  Wait, wait, wait, what's this?
[6845.89s -> 6846.59s]  Why do you have a trophy?
[6848.71s -> 6850.41s]  Oh, it's molly noodles.
[6856.27s -> 6861.18s]  Oh, do you have any hints?
[6861.38s -> 6861.88s]  I gotta go.
[6861.88s -> 6862.28s]  All right.
[6870.19s -> 6871.29s]  Park Island Plus?
[6871.29s -> 6872.39s]  We're already doing plus?
[6874.80s -> 6879.20s]  I don't want to do that.
[6882.60s -> 6883.60s]  I don't want to do this.
[6884.76s -> 6886.16s]  Why would I sign myself up for this?
[6889.33s -> 6890.13s]  What's the- what do I have?
[6890.13s -> 6890.43s]  All right.
[6890.43s -> 6891.13s]  What do I have to beat?
[6891.43s -> 6891.93s]  Five?
[6901.79s -> 6902.49s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[6902.49s -> 6903.59s]  Just go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[6905.35s -> 6906.05s]  It's got candy.
[6914.94s -> 6915.44s]  What?
[6919.38s -> 6919.88s]  Hurry up.
[6919.88s -> 6920.88s]  Hurry up before the thing comes.
[6922.52s -> 6924.32s]  How many- how many Fios do I have to rescue?
[6932.09s -> 6933.99s]  Do I just farm the fruits?
[6934.92s -> 6936.02s]  I think that's probably- that's probably a good idea.
[6936.62s -> 6937.12s]  I think.
[6939.68s -> 6940.28s]  Monkey Island.
[6940.28s -> 6940.88s]  Oh, yeah.
[6941.68s -> 6944.98s]  This game was published by LucasArts, right?
[6952.70s -> 6953.70s]  What happens if I win this?
[6956.48s -> 6962.32s]  If you sell one balloon, that's one dollar, and you sell it for one dollar, you get zero dollars.
[6962.32s -> 6964.52s]  But if it's two, you get one dollar, so that's profit.
[6964.52s -> 6966.22s]  But you don't know how much the balloon takes to make.
[6969.06s -> 6972.56s]  Why are you assuming that it takes a dollar in cost to make the balloon?
[6972.96s -> 6973.66s]  You're assuming that.
[6973.66s -> 6974.66s]  We don't have that information.
[6975.24s -> 6976.34s]  It could be one cent.
[6980.02s -> 6980.72s]  Neither do you.
[6984.88s -> 6987.38s]  Will you play Hitman PC for VR?
[6987.38s -> 6988.28s]  Whoa, wait, hold on.
[6988.28s -> 6989.28s]  Everybody stop moving.
[6989.28s -> 6989.88s]  Everybody hold on.
[6990.38s -> 6993.08s]  Will you play Hitman VR on PC when it comes out on the 20th?
[6994.08s -> 6996.88s]  Is that going to line up perfectly for all the VR shit that I want to do?
[6997.42s -> 6998.52s]  Are they actually coming out with that?
[6998.52s -> 7000.42s]  I remember it was just a PSVR thing they did.
[7003.64s -> 7005.64s]  Remember how angry I was that it was PSVR only?
[7005.64s -> 7006.94s]  I'm absolutely going to do that.
[7009.66s -> 7012.56s]  Yeah, I mean, you can 100 million percent expect that.
[7026.71s -> 7028.71s]  Yeah, so the plan's over the next couple weeks.
[7030.46s -> 7032.06s]  I'm going to set up the VR.
[7032.06s -> 7033.76s]  I don't know if I'm going to do it immediately.
[7033.76s -> 7037.16s]  We'll probably do one more stream where I'm not in VR this weekend.
[7038.23s -> 7039.63s]  And then, oh shit.
[7041.43s -> 7042.03s]  Oh, I got the...
[7052.29s -> 7054.39s]  I was waiting for the fire because I thought I was going to...
[7054.39s -> 7055.59s]  Look at how long that takes.
[7055.69s -> 7056.09s]  Whatever.
[7063.04s -> 7063.34s]  All right.
[7063.34s -> 7068.34s]  So what was I saying?
[7068.34s -> 7069.44s]  Okay, right.
[7070.24s -> 7074.96s]  So I just shit out a bird.
[7079.71s -> 7080.71s]  It's so floaty.
[7081.72s -> 7083.12s]  You have to give me some slack.
[7087.82s -> 7088.22s]  All right.
[7089.92s -> 7092.39s]  So we'll probably do something this weekend.
[7092.79s -> 7096.19s]  And then after this weekend, I'm going to set the VR, the big giant VR room
[7096.19s -> 7099.70s]  again. We'll do VR for a couple weeks.
[7100.50s -> 7103.90s]  Then there's going to be something that you probably don't want to miss.
[7104.60s -> 7107.50s]  That last week of January, maybe the first week of February, I'll give you a hard
[7107.50s -> 7108.50s]  date, but I'll make sure to let you know.
[7108.50s -> 7109.40s]  You probably don't want to miss it.
[7110.10s -> 7112.90s]  I would probably make sure I was there when I give you that hard date.
[7116.58s -> 7117.38s]  It's not baseball.
[7119.27s -> 7120.27s]  Baseball is going to be in the spring.
[7123.26s -> 7123.76s]  Something else.
[7124.40s -> 7125.50s]  But it's going to be very fun.
[7125.50s -> 7125.80s]  I think.
[7125.80s -> 7126.10s]  I hope.
[7126.10s -> 7127.30s]  I think it's going to be very exciting.
[7130.16s -> 7133.56s]  But that'll be the last week of January or the please don't drop.
[7133.76s -> 7134.26s]  There we go.
[7138.99s -> 7140.59s]  It'll be within that few weeks.
[7141.30s -> 7142.60s]  January into February.
[7145.00s -> 7146.20s]  Don't let this one just sit up here.
[7147.08s -> 7147.98s]  And nothing even touched me.
[7151.75s -> 7152.85s]  By the time I get this all done.
[7152.85s -> 7154.35s]  This girl's not even going to be in the park anymore.
[7154.35s -> 7155.25s]  Why am I even doing this?
[7156.92s -> 7157.72s]  Oh my goodness.
[7166.30s -> 7166.60s]  Fire.
[7169.83s -> 7170.33s]  That's a lot.
[7172.58s -> 7173.48s]  Doing it for Molly.
[7175.57s -> 7176.27s]  I think there's only one more.
[7181.88s -> 7183.48s]  Is it like a, no, it's not.
[7183.48s -> 7184.38s]  It's not a cat boy stream.
[7190.72s -> 7192.32s]  Is it is a large event.
[7193.16s -> 7193.96s]  That's all I will tell you.
[7194.16s -> 7194.56s]  That's it.
[7194.56s -> 7195.66s]  You're not getting anything else out of me.
[7202.99s -> 7203.99s]  This is not Thrillville.
[7203.99s -> 7204.69s]  Yes, it is.
[7205.65s -> 7206.75s]  When do I get to stop?
[7206.75s -> 7208.05s]  I don't want to play this anymore.
[7208.05s -> 7209.05s]  Molly, please.
[7212.67s -> 7213.67s]  I have no more lives left.
[7214.56s -> 7215.06s]  Did I win?
[7222.67s -> 7223.17s]  Oh, I did it.
[7224.97s -> 7226.27s]  It was fun rescuing.
[7226.94s -> 7228.94s]  I'm laughing because your challenge was a joke.
[7229.04s -> 7230.14s]  No, I want to be friends.
[7239.57s -> 7240.17s]  Sparkling plus.
[7240.17s -> 7240.47s]  I got it.
[7243.61s -> 7243.81s]  All right.
[7243.81s -> 7244.71s]  Do anything else you want me to do?
[7244.71s -> 7245.71s]  You got a gold thing on you.
[7245.81s -> 7246.11s]  What's that?
[7249.90s -> 7250.40s]  Wait a second.
[7251.30s -> 7252.20s]  Why don't you like me?
[7257.26s -> 7257.46s]  Wait.
[7257.46s -> 7258.66s]  Hey, I was, I want to talk.
[7259.06s -> 7260.86s]  I wasn't, why does she hate me?
[7265.10s -> 7265.20s]  All right.
[7265.20s -> 7266.30s]  What are the missions we got?
[7268.17s -> 7268.67s]  Upkeep.
[7271.53s -> 7272.33s]  Mechanical marvels.
[7272.33s -> 7273.33s]  Balloon tender.
[7275.03s -> 7276.73s]  Italic balloons and interview the robots.
[7276.73s -> 7279.03s]  I don't care about robots circuitry.
[7279.03s -> 7279.43s]  Build.
[7280.03s -> 7280.43s]  Busted.
[7280.43s -> 7282.73s]  Build a coaster the longer the better and then break it.
[7285.17s -> 7285.67s]  Wait, what?
[7290.50s -> 7293.50s]  Globo joy robots are so stupid.
[7293.50s -> 7296.60s]  They'll go on any ride they see and I'm trying to hurt them.
[7296.60s -> 7297.40s]  I'm trying to kill them.
[7299.62s -> 7300.92s]  Make a coaster crash.
[7302.17s -> 7303.27s]  I think I have enough money to do it.
[7303.27s -> 7303.67s]  Let's do it.
[7307.42s -> 7308.32s]  Where's there a coaster one?
[7308.32s -> 7308.62s]  Right here.
[7313.74s -> 7314.44s]  Park upgrades.
[7316.72s -> 7317.52s]  Do more research.
[7319.58s -> 7320.18s]  Marketing.
[7321.88s -> 7322.38s]  Research.
[7323.98s -> 7325.38s]  Earnly a hundred dollars spending.
[7326.91s -> 7327.71s]  I could do 300 bucks.
[7332.90s -> 7333.60s]  You have to kill them.
[7335.53s -> 7336.73s]  I mean, I'm about to.
[7341.67s -> 7341.87s]  All right.
[7341.87s -> 7342.67s]  Where's this coaster?
[7343.66s -> 7344.66s]  I can build a racetrack too.
[7344.66s -> 7345.66s]  No coaster coaster.
[7345.66s -> 7346.46s]  Let's go build my own.
[7350.47s -> 7351.47s]  Ooh, a dinghy.
[7352.39s -> 7352.79s]  Yep.
[7352.89s -> 7353.59s]  We're doing a dinghy.
[7357.60s -> 7358.00s]  All right.
[7358.00s -> 7359.70s]  The direction is going to go this way.
[7361.62s -> 7362.82s]  What do we got for whoa?
[7362.82s -> 7370.42s]  Ooh, wait, this is just supposed to crash.
[7370.42s -> 7371.22s]  Why would I waste any money?
[7371.22s -> 7372.12s]  Just dump them right here.
[7373.66s -> 7375.26s]  Just dump them into right.
[7380.04s -> 7380.94s]  Why not just dump them?
[7388.20s -> 7389.10s]  Let's go up first.
[7390.19s -> 7391.19s]  I need length first.
[7391.19s -> 7391.69s]  Oh, okay.
[7394.00s -> 7395.80s]  How about we get them out of the game map?
[7396.10s -> 7397.50s]  So they actually can never come back.
[7399.29s -> 7399.59s]  Right.
[7415.82s -> 7416.52s]  Out of bounds.
[7416.62s -> 7417.32s]  Oh, that's fine.
[7417.32s -> 7419.42s]  Yeah, I want to make sure that they actually can never come back.
[7421.95s -> 7423.15s]  This would be out of bounds, right?
[7431.70s -> 7433.60s]  That'll throw them far enough where they get out of bounds.
[7434.41s -> 7435.21s]  Read the mission.
[7438.54s -> 7439.14s]  Wait, wasn't it?
[7443.60s -> 7445.00s]  Jack them into the parking lot.
[7448.41s -> 7449.61s]  It needs to be hot.
[7449.61s -> 7450.71s]  They need to have more fun.
[7459.71s -> 7459.91s]  All right.
[7459.91s -> 7460.71s]  Let me actually make something.
[7460.71s -> 7462.71s]  That's not a straight line up in a straight line down.
[7462.71s -> 7463.21s]  That'd be nice.
[7466.66s -> 7470.16s]  You need to build a ride with 1400 feet of track that kills them.
[7470.66s -> 7471.66s]  Oh, okay.
[7484.02s -> 7485.62s]  All right, then let's start here.
[7486.85s -> 7489.75s]  Let's have it go back down through it like thread and needle.
[7490.75s -> 7491.35s]  That'd be kind of cool.
[7509.63s -> 7511.13s]  Okay, now let's add a whoa factor.
[7523.20s -> 7524.20s]  I don't want it to be that far.
[7525.12s -> 7525.62s]  There we go.
[7532.30s -> 7532.90s]  Add the pretzel.
[7535.99s -> 7537.29s]  You're gonna get decapitated.
[7538.73s -> 7539.53s]  You're gonna be all right.
[7540.23s -> 7541.63s]  And then I'm gonna shake the fuck out of them.
[7549.48s -> 7550.58s]  And it's supposed to crash, right?
[7557.78s -> 7559.08s]  Crash directly into this tree.
[7561.35s -> 7561.85s]  How far is it?
[7561.85s -> 7563.35s]  Do I have any indicator how far?
[7565.11s -> 7567.31s]  Back speed 86 miles per hour.
[7568.05s -> 7569.15s]  Length 1500.
[7569.15s -> 7572.74s]  All right, this should work.
[7573.38s -> 7574.08s]  I think that's good to go.
[7578.05s -> 7578.45s]  Let's go.
[7582.32s -> 7582.92s]  Stop building.
[7584.04s -> 7585.74s]  If you stop building now, your coaster will crash.
[7585.74s -> 7586.74s]  Yeah, but that's what I'm supposed to do.
[7590.20s -> 7590.60s]  All right.
[7593.64s -> 7594.24s]  I try it.
[7595.56s -> 7596.06s]  Let's try it.
[7601.15s -> 7602.85s]  Actually, this kind of looks like a water slide.
[7602.85s -> 7603.85s]  That's at a water park.
[7614.54s -> 7615.04s]  Where am I?
[7616.41s -> 7617.01s]  Oh, there I am.
[7619.44s -> 7620.94s]  Water does not go up like that.
[7620.94s -> 7621.34s]  Why am I saying?
[7621.34s -> 7622.74s]  I thought it was the same clip again.
[7624.44s -> 7625.24s]  Go first person.
[7625.24s -> 7625.54s]  All right.
[7628.90s -> 7630.90s]  Oh, here we go.
[7638.83s -> 7639.73s]  That was kind of cool.
[7640.31s -> 7641.01s]  Did we do it again?
[7655.41s -> 7656.31s]  Oh, all right.
[7656.31s -> 7656.91s]  It's perfect.
[7658.22s -> 7659.52s]  I wouldn't ride this though.
[7659.52s -> 7661.22s]  I don't, people are riding this?
[7662.56s -> 7664.96s]  I thought I made this to kill robots, not kill people.
[7668.96s -> 7669.86s]  Before you go on there.
[7686.50s -> 7687.30s]  Oh shit.
[7691.14s -> 7692.74s]  Can they even make it back over here?
[7692.74s -> 7694.14s]  I don't think they can make it back.
[7697.28s -> 7699.48s]  Why is this crashing every five seconds?
[7700.95s -> 7702.45s]  There's too many people on this.
[7706.55s -> 7709.85s]  Okay, but what is, what happens if I hurt too many people?
[7718.68s -> 7719.18s]  You're nothing.
[7719.18s -> 7719.58s]  All right.
[7719.78s -> 7721.68s]  So am I, is this, am I doing this right?
[7723.95s -> 7724.25s]  Build.
[7725.66s -> 7726.16s]  Busted.
[7726.56s -> 7727.26s]  Oh, I got it.
[7729.52s -> 7729.92s]  Okay.
[7730.88s -> 7731.38s]  What's this one?
[7731.38s -> 7736.48s]  Stick it to those rascally robots by building an incredible mini golf course that will foil the robots and logic circuits.
[7737.96s -> 7738.56s]  Wait a minute.
[7739.90s -> 7740.30s]  What?
[7741.46s -> 7742.96s]  I can build my own mini golf course?
[7751.09s -> 7751.59s]  Excuse me.
[7756.20s -> 7757.00s]  Uh, excuse me.
[7757.40s -> 7757.80s]  Really?
[7759.28s -> 7759.78s]  Let's put it right here.
[7759.78s -> 7761.38s]  I'm gonna put a hamburger stall right next to it.
[7766.37s -> 7766.87s]  What?
[7768.15s -> 7770.25s]  I can do my own mini golf course?
[7773.76s -> 7774.66s]  Oh my goodness.
[7774.66s -> 7775.06s]  Okay.
[7781.94s -> 7782.74s]  No way.
[7785.32s -> 7786.22s]  All right, that's hole one.
[7786.32s -> 7790.34s]  This is hole two.
[7798.98s -> 7799.48s]  Okay.
[7805.14s -> 7806.04s]  All right, now hole three.
[7856.24s -> 7857.64s]  Can you get a hole in one in this?
[7857.64s -> 7858.44s]  I don't think so.
[7858.54s -> 7859.98s]  Stop, stop, stop.
[7859.98s -> 7860.28s]  What?
[7860.28s -> 7861.58s]  I'm, come on.
[7861.58s -> 7862.38s]  I'm having fun.
[7873.06s -> 7874.86s]  People are gonna get stuck on this forever.
[7878.39s -> 7879.19s]  No way.
[7879.29s -> 7880.99s]  It's gonna take three hours to do this.
[7882.49s -> 7883.49s]  I don't want to play this.
[7888.70s -> 7889.50s]  Should I try it?
[7892.50s -> 7894.20s]  Wait, I gotta do a paint, paint job on it.
[7899.12s -> 7900.12s]  Oh, I kind of like blue.
[7900.98s -> 7901.68s]  No, it's ugly.
[7905.14s -> 7906.44s]  Um, I don't want the red though.
[7907.04s -> 7910.03s]  I want, I don't like it.
[7912.97s -> 7913.57s]  Oh, here we go.
[7913.57s -> 7914.27s]  They're actually gonna play.
[7917.40s -> 7918.20s]  I'm very curious.
[7920.02s -> 7920.72s]  Get out of the way camera.
[7920.72s -> 7921.12s]  Stop it.
[7921.12s -> 7921.52s]  I want to see.
[7921.72s -> 7923.42s]  Let's see how they do.
[7924.80s -> 7925.30s]  Hole in one.
[7925.30s -> 7925.70s]  Nice.
[7927.58s -> 7928.38s]  On to the second hole.
[7929.52s -> 7930.42s]  This one's a little trickier.
[7931.25s -> 7932.85s]  Cause you have to go forward with it.
[7934.73s -> 7935.63s]  Yeah, nice work.
[7936.43s -> 7937.13s]  Pretty good form.
[7939.68s -> 7940.08s]  On to the next hole.
[7940.08s -> 7941.98s]  What about, uh, what about Ted here?
[7944.79s -> 7945.49s]  Ooh, did you get it?
[7946.48s -> 7947.08s]  Nice.
[7948.64s -> 7949.24s]  Very nice.
[7950.45s -> 7950.95s]  Good luck.
[7959.77s -> 7960.77s]  Realizing what you've done.
[7961.82s -> 7963.62s]  Realizing you may, maybe shouldn't have played.
[7968.58s -> 7969.08s]  Good.
[7970.29s -> 7971.09s]  Where'd you get it to?
[7971.76s -> 7972.16s]  Right there.
[7972.16s -> 7972.96s]  That's one shot.
[7977.30s -> 7977.80s]  Nice.
[7980.99s -> 7982.39s]  This is gonna be quite a bottleneck.
[7989.77s -> 7990.67s]  This queue.
[7991.27s -> 7993.07s]  One person an hour can play this.
[7993.17s -> 7995.27s]  It's gonna be like a 20 stroke course.
[7996.10s -> 7996.90s]  All right, everybody out of the way.
[7996.90s -> 7997.60s]  It's my place.
[7997.60s -> 7998.30s]  I want to play.
[8003.87s -> 8004.37s]  All right.
[8005.19s -> 8006.19s]  I got a bet for you.
[8006.80s -> 8011.44s]  Can I complete my own mini golf course in less than 20 strokes?
[8016.14s -> 8017.64s]  20 strokes or less.
[8021.76s -> 8022.26s]  Here we go.
[8023.25s -> 8023.75s]  You want to bet?
[8024.80s -> 8025.70s]  Like, no, no, no, no.
[8025.70s -> 8026.40s]  Way more than that.
[8026.60s -> 8028.10s]  30 strokes or less.
[8028.10s -> 8028.70s]  I'll do the whole thing.
[8033.69s -> 8034.19s]  Predictions.
[8034.19s -> 8034.59s]  Let's do it.
[8034.59s -> 8035.39s]  I think I can do it.
[8038.24s -> 8041.14s]  I don't think you guys understand my strategy that I'm going to employ here.
[8041.93s -> 8043.03s]  You don't know the strategy.
[8043.13s -> 8043.43s]  Go ahead.
[8043.53s -> 8044.13s]  Bet against me.
[8044.53s -> 8044.83s]  Do it.
[8045.50s -> 8047.80s]  Can I do this whole course in 30 strokes or less?
[8055.32s -> 8056.02s]  You said 20.
[8056.02s -> 8056.22s]  Yeah.
[8056.22s -> 8057.62s]  Then I corrected it before the poll went up.
[8057.72s -> 8058.42s]  30 or less.
[8063.07s -> 8063.57s]  Good luck.
[8063.87s -> 8068.07s]  I hope you vote correctly because I am going to show you something very special.
[8074.28s -> 8074.98s]  Another few seconds.
[8075.95s -> 8077.65s]  Or you'll give 5,000 subs.
[8077.65s -> 8079.25s]  That's not going to happen.
[8079.25s -> 8079.75s]  So no.
[8083.15s -> 8083.85s]  Let them all vote.
[8092.24s -> 8093.44s]  30 strokes or less.
[8101.16s -> 8101.56s]  Here we go.
[8104.05s -> 8104.55s]  That's one.
[8107.30s -> 8107.70s]  Really?
[8108.50s -> 8108.90s]  Two.
[8109.00s -> 8110.10s]  That's so easy.
[8110.20s -> 8111.30s]  Oh my God.
[8111.30s -> 8111.60s]  Don't.
[8112.10s -> 8112.50s]  All right.
[8113.52s -> 8113.92s]  Two.
[8117.85s -> 8118.25s]  Three.
[8119.37s -> 8119.77s]  All right.
[8119.77s -> 8120.07s]  We're good.
[8120.07s -> 8120.47s]  We're good.
[8125.43s -> 8125.83s]  Here we go.
[8128.13s -> 8129.03s]  Just a straight shot.
[8129.03s -> 8130.33s]  Oh, please.
[8131.10s -> 8131.90s]  Was that three?
[8135.54s -> 8135.94s]  Four.
[8141.77s -> 8142.17s]  Five.
[8148.60s -> 8149.20s]  Six.
[8151.28s -> 8153.68s]  And seven.
[8153.78s -> 8155.58s]  Here comes seven.
[8155.88s -> 8156.58s]  Motherfuckers.
[8156.58s -> 8159.68s]  You didn't think I was going to skip the whole goddamn course?
[8176.64s -> 8177.14s]  Yes.
[8184.05s -> 8185.45s]  You all lose.
[8185.75s -> 8187.05s]  You all lose.
[8187.75s -> 8189.75s]  Never bet against me again.
[8196.42s -> 8204.29s]  Okay, do it.
[8204.29s -> 8204.69s]  All right.
[8204.69s -> 8205.79s]  I got 11 under par.
[8205.89s -> 8206.69s]  That's game over.
[8206.89s -> 8210.09s]  Congratulations to those who would actually understood what I was doing there.
[8213.39s -> 8216.75s]  I did that in less shots that I took to the first hole.
[8220.54s -> 8221.04s]  I didn't.
[8221.54s -> 8226.18s]  All I told you was I was going to complete this in under 30 strokes.
[8227.24s -> 8228.84s]  I didn't tell you how I was going to do that.
[8232.46s -> 8234.06s]  I just got 85,000 points.
[8242.83s -> 8243.43s]  Oh goodness.
[8243.43s -> 8243.83s]  All right.
[8243.83s -> 8244.93s]  So now what do I want to do?
[8247.24s -> 8247.84s]  How much money do I have?
[8247.84s -> 8249.04s]  Only 3,200 bucks.
[8249.04s -> 8249.44s]  How?
[8251.85s -> 8253.35s]  My wife is going to kill me.
[8259.24s -> 8260.54s]  Escape drop coaster?
[8261.86s -> 8262.16s]  All right.
[8262.16s -> 8263.96s]  We have to have a really crazy escape drop.
[8264.16s -> 8267.63s]  So let me understand what's going on here.
[8267.63s -> 8271.16s]  We're trying to get rid of the robots and to get rid of the robots.
[8271.16s -> 8273.86s]  We have to make rides that are incredibly dangerous.
[8275.02s -> 8275.82s]  So they leave.
[8276.22s -> 8280.02s]  But in the process we're going to kill thousands of actual just park goers.
[8284.60s -> 8285.00s]  Okay.
[8293.86s -> 8294.56s]  Do you like hockey?
[8299.42s -> 8300.82s]  Do that again or scared?
[8300.92s -> 8301.92s]  No, I don't have to do it again.
[8301.92s -> 8302.92s]  I already did what I was going to do.
[8304.98s -> 8307.48s]  A crush lizard and ratchet bandicoot.
[8307.48s -> 8308.98s]  Thanks for the 20 community subs each.
[8311.13s -> 8311.53s]  Thanks a lot.
[8311.53s -> 8312.03s]  Appreciate it.
[8312.13s -> 8312.83s]  That's a lot of money.
[8312.83s -> 8313.23s]  Thank you.
[8316.76s -> 8316.96s]  All right.
[8316.96s -> 8318.06s]  I can't be friends with these people.
[8319.17s -> 8320.17s]  I don't think they like me.
[8324.24s -> 8325.14s]  These robots don't.
[8325.14s -> 8326.44s]  I can't make my friend me to go up.
[8328.76s -> 8329.86s]  Wait, I want to jump on the trampoline.
[8337.13s -> 8339.63s]  Oh wait backwards left right jump trick one two.
[8339.83s -> 8340.23s]  Ooh.
[8341.68s -> 8342.08s]  All right.
[8352.72s -> 8353.72s]  This is kind of scary.
[8359.16s -> 8363.46s]  Does anybody else feel like the trampoline is like kind of just bad for your organs or something?
[8363.46s -> 8365.96s]  I feel like your stomach is going down to where your groin is.
[8379.54s -> 8380.74s]  Oh, that was on the head.
[8382.06s -> 8382.56s]  He's all right.
[8397.75s -> 8398.35s]  Is that eight?
[8398.35s -> 8400.95s]  Wait, did you say 18th century way of thinking or something?
[8400.95s -> 8401.45s]  What do you mean?
[8401.55s -> 8403.25s]  Like because I don't know how organs work.
[8404.83s -> 8405.33s]  Do that again.
[8405.53s -> 8406.03s]  I want to do it again.
[8419.83s -> 8425.86s]  Oh, you're gonna put olives on all your fingers for 10 million off the debt.
[8432.18s -> 8433.88s]  That's the weirdest comment I've read all day.
[8444.67s -> 8446.27s]  I don't have olives.
[8447.53s -> 8450.13s]  Why are you assuming that I have a jar of olives in my house?
[8451.48s -> 8452.08s]  Olives?
[8456.22s -> 8457.02s]  That was fine.
[8460.74s -> 8462.04s]  I don't have olives in.
[8462.14s -> 8463.64s]  I don't have olives in my fridge.
[8469.60s -> 8470.20s]  All right, last try.
[8481.34s -> 8485.12s]  Oh, go buy olives.
[8485.62s -> 8489.03s]  Okay, the next stream you see.
[8489.80s -> 8493.00s]  I will put olives on my fingers and go into the camera and go like
[8494.10s -> 8495.90s]  with all my fingers with olives on them.
[8497.22s -> 8500.02s]  Okay, is that what you want to see is I'll do it.
[8503.75s -> 8504.65s]  He landed on his feet.
[8518.54s -> 8519.84s]  I landed on my feet.
[8526.54s -> 8528.14s]  It was always if you ever were on a trampoline.
[8528.14s -> 8532.16s]  It was always really embarrassing because I was always the guy.
[8532.76s -> 8535.86s]  I could do the backflip on a trampoline, right?
[8536.89s -> 8537.69s]  It was like no way man.
[8537.69s -> 8538.39s]  You could do backflip.
[8538.69s -> 8539.89s]  Whoa, no, it's awesome.
[8540.49s -> 8544.33s]  If you ever screwed it up, if you ever like landed like on your
[8544.33s -> 8546.53s]  butt, it was like a huge embarrassment.
[8548.14s -> 8550.34s]  It's like you're supposed to be the guy that can do that.
[8550.64s -> 8553.14s]  You're supposed to be the person that can do that and you didn't.
[8554.42s -> 8556.32s]  Everyone just kind of like, oh, nice try.
[8556.32s -> 8559.24s]  I guess like no, no, I promise I can do it.
[8559.24s -> 8559.64s]  I promise.
[8559.64s -> 8560.04s]  I promise.
[8563.21s -> 8564.71s]  What a dangerous thing to have.
[8566.16s -> 8569.16s]  The trampoline is incredibly dangerous.
[8573.91s -> 8575.01s]  I need to clean this place up.
[8579.69s -> 8580.59s]  I almost have a level up though.
[8580.59s -> 8581.09s]  This is cool.
[8581.09s -> 8581.49s]  All right.
[8582.29s -> 8584.76s]  Guest robo losers.
[8586.65s -> 8590.95s]  Frederick Moe Potts is saying he's going to write another bad review
[8590.95s -> 8593.65s]  of Thrillville now that robots are running amok in the park.
[8594.19s -> 8596.49s]  Why don't you see about giving him a gift preferably something
[8596.49s -> 8598.59s]  he likes that will keep his mind off of writing.
[8601.64s -> 8601.84s]  All right.
[8601.84s -> 8602.44s]  What do you look?
[8604.04s -> 8604.54s]  What do you like?
[8605.34s -> 8607.78s]  It's review time, you know, huh?
[8610.73s -> 8619.98s]  How's it your fair and honest, you know, I'd be even more fair
[8619.98s -> 8621.08s]  if you help me out with present.
[8621.94s -> 8622.84s]  You want a present?
[8622.94s -> 8623.34s]  Okay.
[8625.72s -> 8626.72s]  A bribe it is Moe.
[8626.92s -> 8630.44s]  Bribe is such an ugly, unsophisticated word.
[8630.94s -> 8632.04s]  Is this Bart Simpson?
[8632.24s -> 8635.44s]  As if you're doing me a favor and then I return said favor.
[8636.14s -> 8638.84s]  You know, Knowledge TV has a lot of beauties.
[8638.84s -> 8639.24s]  How many?
[8640.66s -> 8641.16s]  How many?
[8645.90s -> 8647.10s]  Pop a walk creep.
[8647.20s -> 8652.59s]  You get bup kiss or maybe there is something I can do for you.
[8652.99s -> 8661.51s]  I'm glad we can agree to agree.
[8661.51s -> 8662.81s]  So what present do you want?
[8662.81s -> 8664.81s]  A nice sideshow prize would be great.
[8664.81s -> 8665.61s]  Sideshow prize.
[8665.61s -> 8666.81s]  I can get home and show it to the family.
[8667.11s -> 8668.31s]  Wouldn't pretend like you got it.
[8671.30s -> 8675.50s]  You want you want you want to have the prize where you can prove
[8675.50s -> 8678.70s]  to people that you got at least 60 or 70 on the test of strength
[8679.33s -> 8680.53s]  because you can't do it on your own.
[8682.22s -> 8684.22s]  You can tell people that you did because they know that's where
[8684.22s -> 8685.12s]  the prize came from.
[8685.22s -> 8685.82s]  I understand.
[8686.32s -> 8686.82s]  I get it.
[8687.52s -> 8687.92s]  Get it.
[8689.82s -> 8690.22s]  Okay.
[8691.28s -> 8692.18s]  You want a prize?
[8699.74s -> 8700.64s]  This place is awesome.
[8700.94s -> 8702.24s]  Well, I want to play the basketball game.
[8704.46s -> 8705.36s]  Oh, that's Robo K.
[8705.36s -> 8706.56s]  Oh, I want to play the basketball.
[8710.37s -> 8711.37s]  Then no basketball.
[8713.68s -> 8714.58s]  How do I play that?
[8717.21s -> 8718.21s]  That looks like fun.
[8718.31s -> 8719.11s]  How come I can't do that?
[8724.43s -> 8725.53s]  It's just a decoration.
[8726.23s -> 8731.87s]  Oh, what was I doing?
[8734.08s -> 8734.98s]  There's money just over here.
[8741.01s -> 8741.91s]  What is this?
[8743.10s -> 8744.30s]  This is another decoration.
[8745.97s -> 8746.97s]  This place is crazy.
[8749.60s -> 8754.96s]  Oh, I need to build.
[8754.96s -> 8755.46s]  I okay.
[8755.46s -> 8756.86s]  I have to build the drop coaster.
[8758.37s -> 8758.57s]  Yeah.
[8758.57s -> 8758.67s]  Okay.
[8758.67s -> 8761.37s]  I got to find a place to build a coaster and it has to be horrible.
[8761.97s -> 8763.67s]  Like terrifying scary and hurt people.
[8769.59s -> 8770.99s]  Is there a place for a coaster here?
[8773.72s -> 8779.61s]  Now we're going to go back keep haven't done any of these.
[8783.36s -> 8784.66s]  If you got about the bribe.
[8784.76s -> 8785.86s]  Oh, right, right, right, right.
[8785.86s -> 8786.86s]  How do I get a prize?
[8788.60s -> 8789.60s]  How do I even get a prize?
[8789.60s -> 8791.20s]  All the games I played haven't had any prizes.
[8797.42s -> 8798.02s]  Am I left?
[8798.52s -> 8799.12s]  Oh, right here.
[8805.20s -> 8805.40s]  All right.
[8805.40s -> 8805.90s]  Here we go.
[8808.92s -> 8810.62s]  So it needs to be one of these drop rides.
[8811.12s -> 8811.92s]  Line coaster.
[8816.07s -> 8816.77s]  What was it called?
[8817.27s -> 8817.97s]  I'm going to sneeze.
[8819.23s -> 8820.33s]  I can't hear.
[8820.93s -> 8822.03s]  I couldn't mute fast enough.
[8822.80s -> 8823.40s]  I'm sorry.
[8823.80s -> 8824.80s]  I really did try.
[8828.28s -> 8831.34s]  Another 25 subs from Addie.
[8831.34s -> 8831.94s]  Thank you Addie.
[8832.44s -> 8833.84s]  Actually more than that like 35.
[8834.62s -> 8835.72s]  You guys are giving a lot of money today.
[8836.12s -> 8836.52s]  Unnecessary.
[8836.52s -> 8837.12s]  Don't do this.
[8839.40s -> 8840.40s]  You don't have to give me any money.
[8841.53s -> 8841.83s]  Thank you.
[8844.77s -> 8846.27s]  We're racetracks.
[8851.46s -> 8852.36s]  Isn't this thing a dropper?
[8858.96s -> 8859.96s]  Oh, here is escape drop.
[8859.96s -> 8860.16s]  All right.
[8860.16s -> 8860.56s]  Let's go.
[8863.07s -> 8864.57s]  This is just one of those like tower terrors.
[8866.82s -> 8868.72s]  I'm going to have it go this way because there's more room over here.
[8871.31s -> 8871.61s]  All right.
[8871.61s -> 8873.01s]  So this is it's it goes up.
[8873.82s -> 8880.56s]  And then I'm going to put at the very beginning.
[8883.22s -> 8886.72s]  I let's go another let's do loop, loop, loop, loop, loop.
[8901.34s -> 8902.44s]  I think loop at the beginning.
[8903.92s -> 8907.14s]  Then go through the fire.
[8910.16s -> 8911.46s]  I need five drops.
[8912.38s -> 8913.98s]  I don't have enough real estate to do that.
[8914.62s -> 8915.92s]  I barely have enough room for one.
[8927.03s -> 8928.73s]  So I have to do just do this five times.
[8937.47s -> 8938.17s]  I don't want to spin it.
[8947.20s -> 8948.10s]  It counts as a drop, right?
[8959.92s -> 8960.82s]  I come back this way.
[8961.87s -> 8963.57s]  This variety is being named big Chungus.
[8965.04s -> 8967.54s]  I don't think it has to be named that but I'll consider that name.
[8979.92s -> 8981.72s]  Hey, there's one two.
[8981.82s -> 8982.82s]  This is this is crazy.
[8987.78s -> 8988.48s]  This is not a bad one.
[8988.48s -> 8989.18s]  This is pretty cool.
[8993.29s -> 8995.19s]  The stats on it 82 thrill.
[8995.19s -> 8996.79s]  I got to make it really really horrible, right?
[9000.96s -> 9001.86s]  Let's get it back up then.
[9007.47s -> 9008.17s]  Oh my goodness.
[9008.17s -> 9008.97s]  What am I thinking?
[9008.97s -> 9009.47s]  Hold on.
[9010.72s -> 9012.62s]  Wait, can I I can just go straight down?
[9014.68s -> 9015.68s]  That that would be awful.
[9032.49s -> 9033.19s]  Too much too much.
[9038.12s -> 9038.72s]  Too close.
[9048.84s -> 9049.84s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[9054.34s -> 9055.44s]  Oh, it's a corkscrew.
[9057.67s -> 9058.47s]  Oh, that would be cool.
[9058.47s -> 9059.37s]  And come on really.
[9061.15s -> 9067.21s]  All right, just help me finish it real 100 nausea 79.
[9067.21s -> 9068.01s]  This thing is awful.
[9070.35s -> 9070.85s]  Check it out.
[9087.02s -> 9088.32s]  This is going slow.
[9091.59s -> 9093.19s]  I'm just hanging people upside down.
[9094.02s -> 9095.02s]  This is not going fast.
[9103.85s -> 9105.58s]  Is it okay?
[9105.58s -> 9106.78s]  Was that just to get you ready?
[9109.34s -> 9110.54s]  Why is it going so slow?
[9110.64s -> 9113.88s]  This sucks.
[9120.06s -> 9123.46s]  It just puts a bunch of a blood to your brain.
[9127.77s -> 9129.57s]  Why is this a hundred thrill?
[9138.50s -> 9139.80s]  Is it going to actually move now?
[9142.23s -> 9144.03s]  Guys, this is going straight down.
[9150.97s -> 9152.57s]  It's not on slow mode.
[9154.74s -> 9156.44s]  There's no such thing as slow mode.
[9171.32s -> 9178.63s]  The whole thing is just a powered track.
[9178.73s -> 9180.43s]  The whole thing is it is chain.
[9185.52s -> 9186.32s]  Where's the drop?
[9198.28s -> 9198.48s]  Okay.
[9198.48s -> 9199.88s]  So this ride we just hang people up.
[9199.88s -> 9200.48s]  All right, whatever.
[9200.58s -> 9201.58s]  They're not going to want to ride it.
[9206.75s -> 9207.25s]  Okay.
[9207.35s -> 9208.35s]  End the ride, please.
[9212.38s -> 9213.48s]  They're lining up ready to go.
[9215.24s -> 9216.04s]  They want to ride it.
[9216.34s -> 9216.74s]  All right.
[9216.74s -> 9229.70s]  Well, oh, what did I do wrong there?
[9237.95s -> 9239.15s]  I did everything wrong.
[9244.78s -> 9246.98s]  Somebody has a big plan to stop Thrillville.
[9249.12s -> 9250.62s]  New minigame in party play.
[9250.62s -> 9251.62s]  Sparkle Island Classic.
[9251.62s -> 9253.22s]  Do you wish to view your new trophy?
[9253.22s -> 9253.52s]  No.
[9256.97s -> 9257.97s]  Good luck everybody on this ride.
[9257.97s -> 9258.67s]  I hope you like it.
[9258.87s -> 9260.67s]  I think all the robots are coming here.
[9262.66s -> 9262.86s]  All right.
[9262.86s -> 9264.46s]  I definitely got that mission for sure.
[9271.51s -> 9273.21s]  That skill rating is not high enough.
[9273.21s -> 9273.41s]  All right.
[9273.41s -> 9273.81s]  There we go.
[9276.05s -> 9276.35s]  All right.
[9276.65s -> 9278.15s]  I ain't got a games.
[9283.38s -> 9284.88s]  Some coaster types are slower than others.
[9284.88s -> 9288.18s]  Yeah, not that's going as fast as traffic goes on a highway.
[9289.62s -> 9290.92s]  It's like five miles per hour.
[9294.20s -> 9294.50s]  All right.
[9294.50s -> 9296.30s]  I need to I got to get this guy present.
[9296.30s -> 9297.30s]  So I bribe him.
[9301.66s -> 9303.06s]  I got a hundred dollars for doing that.
[9304.68s -> 9305.68s]  It's not worth doing that.
[9308.15s -> 9308.55s]  All right.
[9308.65s -> 9309.55s]  I got to find a prize.
[9309.55s -> 9310.85s]  Do I have anything in my inventory?
[9316.29s -> 9317.49s]  Aranoid Android.
[9321.47s -> 9321.97s]  Manage.
[9323.90s -> 9324.80s]  Teen dream.
[9326.30s -> 9326.60s]  All right.
[9326.60s -> 9328.30s]  I've got 75 teenagers here.
[9331.48s -> 9333.68s]  I need to get rid of robots still.
[9338.29s -> 9338.59s]  All right.
[9338.79s -> 9339.59s]  Buy up.
[9339.59s -> 9340.89s]  I got to get a balloon or something.
[9341.47s -> 9342.47s]  Is there a balloon stall somewhere?
[9342.47s -> 9342.67s]  Okay.
[9342.67s -> 9343.27s]  I got to go this way.
[9344.80s -> 9345.60s]  Let's go to Oceanville.
[9349.64s -> 9350.24s]  Where are my friends?
[9353.61s -> 9354.91s]  VIP pass.
[9356.58s -> 9357.88s]  Tim Twinklefingers.
[9357.88s -> 9358.78s]  I don't even know who this is.
[9361.13s -> 9362.13s]  Remember Molly noodles?
[9362.93s -> 9363.73s]  Mo Pots.
[9363.73s -> 9364.23s]  All right.
[9364.43s -> 9366.43s]  Should I give him a pass or something?
[9370.15s -> 9372.15s]  Let's teleport to to Mo Pots.
[9377.21s -> 9377.41s]  All right.
[9377.41s -> 9378.41s]  Can I give him something?
[9381.46s -> 9383.76s]  You get prizes from minigames not vendors.
[9386.97s -> 9387.37s]  Yeah.
[9389.62s -> 9389.82s]  All right.
[9389.82s -> 9390.72s]  I got to go get a prize then.
[9397.41s -> 9398.91s]  Go watch Bionicle with him.
[9401.76s -> 9402.36s]  This is cool.
[9409.56s -> 9410.86s]  I need two more Lindsay's notes.
[9410.86s -> 9411.16s]  What is that?
[9411.16s -> 9412.06s]  What do I get with that?
[9413.58s -> 9415.98s]  I got to get some more attractions and some more money.
[9419.63s -> 9423.03s]  I need to get a I need to get some something here.
[9424.04s -> 9424.54s]  Pizza.
[9425.14s -> 9425.94s]  I need to make money.
[9426.04s -> 9426.74s]  Ooh, let's go.
[9428.89s -> 9433.17s]  Pizza and hats.
[9438.32s -> 9439.52s]  I need a sideshow game.
[9440.71s -> 9441.41s]  Put one right here.
[9443.02s -> 9446.76s]  One more Lindsay's notes and I'll get Lindsay's notebook.
[9450.05s -> 9450.45s]  All right.
[9451.92s -> 9453.02s]  Where's test of strength?
[9455.93s -> 9456.73s]  Is it a stall?
[9463.84s -> 9465.14s]  Is it a game?
[9470.34s -> 9470.74s]  Okay.
[9470.84s -> 9471.84s]  Running cost.
[9472.38s -> 9473.28s]  Ticket price.
[9475.39s -> 9475.89s]  Mini golf.
[9475.89s -> 9477.69s]  I don't see any of those Midway games anywhere.
[9479.61s -> 9480.51s]  Oh sideshow.
[9480.51s -> 9481.61s]  Okay, alley ball.
[9482.54s -> 9483.34s]  Coconut shy.
[9483.34s -> 9483.74s]  All right.
[9483.74s -> 9484.64s]  Let's do alley ball.
[9488.38s -> 9489.38s]  It's not a bad spot for it.
[9495.18s -> 9498.83s]  If anyone price judge the strength of your throw carefully.
[9500.33s -> 9500.73s]  All right.
[9501.94s -> 9502.94s]  Oh, it's ski ball.
[9507.94s -> 9508.34s]  What?
[9518.61s -> 9519.41s]  What the fuck?
[9519.41s -> 9521.01s]  Why are I at full power?
[9521.11s -> 9522.01s]  Take it down.
[9523.07s -> 9524.47s]  How do I take off full power?
[9528.44s -> 9529.44s]  How do I take power down?
[9536.68s -> 9537.18s]  Buttons?
[9539.36s -> 9540.96s]  I'm at I'm at max power.
[9541.26s -> 9542.26s]  I don't know how to put it down.
[9542.96s -> 9543.76s]  That one doesn't work.
[9544.36s -> 9545.96s]  A B what nothing works.
[9554.29s -> 9555.89s]  I don't want to be on max power.
[9555.89s -> 9556.79s]  The trigger buttons.
[9557.98s -> 9559.08s]  It's not the trigger button.
[9559.08s -> 9559.98s]  Nothing works.
[9567.18s -> 9568.18s]  Full power.
[9568.76s -> 9569.46s]  I don't get it.
[9569.56s -> 9570.36s]  Right click.
[9574.34s -> 9575.64s]  Why did that go down?
[9577.81s -> 9579.01s]  I don't understand this at all.
[9579.94s -> 9580.54s]  I don't get it.
[9587.21s -> 9587.91s]  We just have to work with it.
[9590.60s -> 9591.70s]  You're flicking too hard.
[9594.27s -> 9595.17s]  It's a okay.
[9595.17s -> 9597.17s]  It's about the speed of going forward.
[9598.72s -> 9600.52s]  Good luck trying to get that to work right.
[9602.61s -> 9604.61s]  I have to flick softer.
[9605.31s -> 9607.51s]  There is only one speed on flick.
[9607.51s -> 9608.31s]  It's flick.
[9612.40s -> 9613.80s]  There is not slow flick.
[9613.80s -> 9614.90s]  It's just flick.
[9615.30s -> 9616.10s]  It's forward.
[9619.86s -> 9621.06s]  How much do I need for the prize?
[9626.74s -> 9627.74s]  Oh, come on.
[9627.84s -> 9628.24s]  Do it again.
[9629.37s -> 9631.37s]  Pull back then push forward to throw.
[9649.74s -> 9650.04s]  Come on.
[9652.54s -> 9653.24s]  Oh my god.
[9653.24s -> 9654.44s]  It's impossible to do this.
[9654.94s -> 9657.44s]  Because you have to go you have to aim in different other directions.
[9661.99s -> 9663.69s]  I can't even throw it another direction.
[9665.65s -> 9666.75s]  I'm trying to go to the right.
[9670.70s -> 9671.90s]  This is impossible, man.
[9682.56s -> 9683.66s]  I'm leaning so far in.
[9692.53s -> 9693.03s]  Get in there!
[9696.17s -> 9696.57s]  Get in!
[9705.63s -> 9706.03s]  Full clear.
[9706.03s -> 9706.43s]  There it is.
[9712.35s -> 9714.75s]  I'm starting to understand this stupid minigame.
[9715.55s -> 9716.65s]  It's still dumb.
[9724.39s -> 9724.89s]  Please.
[9726.83s -> 9728.13s]  You can't go to the right or left.
[9729.00s -> 9729.60s]  You can't do it.
[9730.40s -> 9731.10s]  This is not possible.
[9731.10s -> 9731.60s]  You can't do it.
[9739.22s -> 9740.82s]  I'm trying to do it so slowly.
[9742.71s -> 9744.11s]  I just did that so slow.
[9748.14s -> 9749.34s]  There's not much slower I can go.
[9750.94s -> 9753.74s]  This is all based on the dead zone of the controller you're using.
[9753.74s -> 9754.14s]  All right.
[9754.14s -> 9754.74s]  I got the prize.
[9754.74s -> 9755.24s]  Let's go.
[9755.74s -> 9756.24s]  High score.
[9759.35s -> 9759.95s]  Did I get a prize?
[9761.11s -> 9761.71s]  Nice.
[9762.11s -> 9763.21s]  Table tennis bat.
[9764.45s -> 9764.95s]  Where is he?
[9774.97s -> 9775.37s]  Where is he?
[9780.97s -> 9781.47s]  Where are you?
[9781.47s -> 9781.97s]  Where is he?
[9785.84s -> 9786.34s]  Where is he?
[9787.26s -> 9787.96s]  Oh, my crowd.
[9790.84s -> 9791.24s]  All right, dude.
[9791.24s -> 9791.74s]  Let's go.
[9792.73s -> 9793.63s]  Give me a good review.
[9799.26s -> 9800.06s]  It's review time.
[9800.54s -> 9801.34s]  It's review time.
[9801.34s -> 9801.64s]  All right.
[9801.64s -> 9803.14s]  I'm positive you're going to give a good review.
[9805.89s -> 9808.90s]  You know, I'd be even more fair if you helped me out.
[9808.90s -> 9809.40s]  You got it.
[9809.94s -> 9810.94s]  I'll be like table tennis.
[9813.21s -> 9814.61s]  Or give you a VIP pass.
[9815.44s -> 9816.04s]  Here, has a bat.
[9816.04s -> 9818.07s]  Is this a good enough?
[9818.07s -> 9818.97s]  That's excellent.
[9819.17s -> 9822.77s]  I think Thrillville just got the hottest park rating on my show.
[9824.63s -> 9825.13s]  Hell yeah.
[9835.13s -> 9836.43s]  They're still playing this.
[9838.50s -> 9840.10s]  All these, this is really scary looking.
[9840.10s -> 9842.60s]  All these robots are waiting for this kid to be done.
[9846.92s -> 9849.22s]  Is that the couple that first was here at the very beginning?
[9854.88s -> 9856.28s]  They're all waiting for these little kids.
[9863.77s -> 9864.77s]  Absolute hell.
[9866.76s -> 9867.76s]  You guys enjoying the park?
[9875.66s -> 9876.66s]  I own this place.
[9877.65s -> 9878.85s]  I'm the park manager.
[9883.09s -> 9885.19s]  Oh, the tone really changed quickly now, didn't it?
[9896.18s -> 9896.68s]  All right.
[9897.18s -> 9898.88s]  Here, you want a VIP pass?
[9904.04s -> 9904.34s]  All right.
[9904.34s -> 9905.24s]  Now we're best friends.
[9905.54s -> 9909.41s]  So now, I am going to ask you a bunch of questions.
[9910.19s -> 9911.69s]  I want them answered immediately.
[9916.36s -> 9918.76s]  It's stupid that they call the playoffs the World Series.
[9919.06s -> 9921.06s]  All the teams are in the United States and Canada.
[9925.19s -> 9925.69s]  It's true.
[9932.95s -> 9933.15s]  All right.
[9933.15s -> 9934.65s]  How about trivia?
[9936.67s -> 9937.07s]  Wait.
[9940.11s -> 9942.01s]  How do you think the park could be improved?
[9945.01s -> 9946.21s]  All right as is, I guess.
[9946.21s -> 9947.41s]  No, that's not good enough.
[9947.91s -> 9948.61s]  That's not good enough.
[9951.46s -> 9952.56s]  What do you think about the park?
[9952.56s -> 9954.36s]  You can't just say, oh, it's all right.
[9954.36s -> 9955.46s]  You got to tell me what you think.
[9955.46s -> 9956.96s]  I really like it here.
[9957.06s -> 9957.56s]  All right.
[9960.16s -> 9961.36s]  These are, what about your kids?
[9961.36s -> 9962.06s]  How are your kids doing?
[9965.68s -> 9969.08s]  Bradley Adams, Sarah Adams, Emily Adams, all the, the Adams family.
[9969.08s -> 9969.58s]  All right.
[9970.88s -> 9972.68s]  How's Sarah Adams?
[9975.00s -> 9975.40s]  Good.
[9983.69s -> 9984.89s]  I challenge you to a duel.
[9988.09s -> 9988.49s]  All right.
[9989.09s -> 9991.09s]  Mini golf on my course.
[9997.78s -> 9998.88s]  Can I do it on my course?
[10001.54s -> 10002.84s]  Or is it going to be, I don't know.
[10002.84s -> 10003.94s]  Is it my course?
[10003.94s -> 10004.94s]  I don't think it's my course.
[10014.96s -> 10015.36s]  It is.
[10019.30s -> 10019.90s]  Good luck.
[10019.90s -> 10022.10s]  I want to see how many strokes she has.
[10029.58s -> 10029.88s]  All right.
[10029.88s -> 10030.68s]  Hole in one.
[10033.41s -> 10033.91s]  Okay.
[10034.51s -> 10036.61s]  She got four strokes on hole two.
[10038.46s -> 10039.66s]  Not bad so far.
[10043.76s -> 10046.66s]  I'm going to probably laugh pretty hard if it's over a hundred.
[10051.72s -> 10053.22s]  It's going to be probably like 60.
[10053.82s -> 10055.83s]  Dude, please.
[10057.66s -> 10061.06s]  I'm of the opinion that all right, this should be a, this should be a circle.
[10062.32s -> 10063.92s]  Two or three inches around this hole.
[10064.32s -> 10067.42s]  That if you just get it in that circle around the hole, then it counts.
[10067.72s -> 10068.42s]  Does it matter?
[10069.38s -> 10072.88s]  It should be, this should be a small like target around the circle.
[10072.98s -> 10074.68s]  And if it leans onto the lip, it should count.
[10076.25s -> 10076.55s]  I don't care.
[10076.55s -> 10079.65s]  Call it like, it's like golf with the bumpers, like bowling.
[10079.65s -> 10080.15s]  I don't care.
[10080.15s -> 10081.15s]  I would rather play it like that.
[10081.15s -> 10081.25s]  All right.
[10081.25s -> 10082.85s]  She had 19 strokes.
[10086.01s -> 10087.11s]  It's a par 19.
[10087.11s -> 10088.61s]  She had, she got 19 strokes.
[10096.58s -> 10097.08s]  I'll get it.
[10109.01s -> 10109.51s]  Uh-oh.
[10118.11s -> 10119.21s]  I got to find the right spot.
[10121.74s -> 10122.24s]  That's good enough.
[10132.53s -> 10133.13s]  Too hard.
[10140.52s -> 10141.32s]  Stroke 11.
[10142.85s -> 10143.35s]  I'm okay.
[10150.54s -> 10150.94s]  I win.
[10157.24s -> 10158.24s]  You see what I'm saying?
[10158.24s -> 10161.24s]  It's just, just have a thing here with a bumpers on it.
[10164.73s -> 10165.23s]  I win.
[10170.44s -> 10171.14s]  You're welcome.
[10175.52s -> 10176.12s]  One more game.
[10177.43s -> 10179.20s]  We're going to do escape drop.
[10180.54s -> 10181.34s]  No, I don't want to do it.
[10181.34s -> 10182.14s]  I hate this one.
[10182.14s -> 10182.64s]  Back out.
[10182.64s -> 10183.64s]  I, I quite a forfeit.
[10200.50s -> 10201.10s]  She's happy.
[10201.10s -> 10201.60s]  She's happy.
[10201.60s -> 10202.20s]  She's having a good time.
[10202.20s -> 10203.10s]  She's very hungry though.
[10209.83s -> 10210.43s]  Warp speed.
[10212.00s -> 10212.70s]  No, what?
[10212.80s -> 10214.10s]  I don't want to do this one either.
[10216.31s -> 10216.81s]  Forfeit.
[10224.52s -> 10225.12s]  What do you think?
[10225.12s -> 10226.26s]  What do you think about the park?
[10226.26s -> 10227.36s]  A kid will give you a real opinion.
[10229.50s -> 10229.70s]  Okay.
[10229.70s -> 10230.00s]  Good.
[10230.20s -> 10230.50s]  Good.
[10232.51s -> 10233.11s]  Have a nice day.
[10241.27s -> 10241.47s]  All right.
[10241.47s -> 10242.67s]  I need to figure this out too.
[10242.67s -> 10248.54s]  So I need to like do matchmaking.
[10248.54s -> 10249.64s]  That's like part of the game.
[10249.84s -> 10250.57s]  Hello.
[10250.57s -> 10251.37s]  Good to see you again.
[10251.37s -> 10252.07s]  Why does she hate me?
[10252.07s -> 10252.67s]  Hello.
[10252.67s -> 10256.97s]  Hey, this park is even better than the last one.
[10256.97s -> 10257.47s]  Why won't she?
[10257.77s -> 10259.27s]  Wait, I can't, I can't talk to her.
[10262.13s -> 10264.53s]  I need to do, it said matchmake with a robot, right?
[10264.53s -> 10264.93s]  Okay.
[10264.93s -> 10265.73s]  So how do I do that?
[10273.80s -> 10275.20s]  It was just to complete a challenge.
[10276.87s -> 10277.67s]  How are you guys doing?
[10282.80s -> 10283.20s]  All right.
[10283.60s -> 10284.60s]  Jake Lopez.
[10284.60s -> 10285.20s]  How's it going?
[10285.20s -> 10285.60s]  What's up?
[10286.00s -> 10286.80s]  How are you doing, Jake?
[10286.80s -> 10290.41s]  I can't tell you how cool, oh wait, I just did.
[10290.51s -> 10290.91s]  All right.
[10292.20s -> 10292.60s]  Thanks.
[10292.60s -> 10292.80s]  Thanks.
[10292.80s -> 10293.60s]  That's good to know.
[10296.25s -> 10296.95s]  Matchmake.
[10297.05s -> 10301.18s]  How about, what do you think about the alley ball?
[10301.18s -> 10301.98s]  You can get some cool prizes.
[10301.98s -> 10303.48s]  The classic sideshow game brought the-
[10303.48s -> 10306.78s]  I already played it at a different park.
[10306.78s -> 10308.08s]  I'll try it again if I have time.
[10308.08s -> 10308.48s]  What park?
[10308.48s -> 10309.28s]  Who stole my idea?
[10309.28s -> 10309.88s]  Somebody took it?
[10311.36s -> 10315.95s]  Well, you must have very strong thumbs from dominated arcade games.
[10316.85s -> 10318.35s]  Yeah, I try, you know.
[10319.95s -> 10320.35s]  All right.
[10323.02s -> 10324.82s]  I don't think this, I don't think this kid's going to be into
[10324.82s -> 10325.72s]  a fishing tournament.
[10328.74s -> 10329.64s]  How about Trivia?
[10330.93s -> 10333.87s]  It's easier to make new ones.
[10334.17s -> 10338.77s]  In fact, a recycled can takes 90% less energy to make than a new one.
[10338.97s -> 10339.37s]  Wow.
[10343.27s -> 10344.37s]  Hot body?
[10350.67s -> 10351.97s]  This is young Sheldon.
[10352.07s -> 10353.27s]  I need to eat more spinach.
[10359.88s -> 10360.18s]  Okay.
[10360.18s -> 10361.78s]  I really like drinks in glass containers.
[10363.94s -> 10367.14s]  A human body gives off a hundred calories of heat each hour.
[10367.54s -> 10369.04s]  That's the same as a hundred-
[10369.24s -> 10371.74s]  Running that park was very difficult for me.
[10373.03s -> 10376.63s]  My friends would always come to the park and give me criticism.
[10378.22s -> 10380.02s]  I did know plenty of information.
[10401.07s -> 10402.27s]  We're best friends now.
[10411.06s -> 10411.56s]  All right.
[10414.19s -> 10414.59s]  What?
[10415.19s -> 10415.89s]  It's me.
[10416.69s -> 10417.99s]  I don't know who that is.
[10432.84s -> 10433.44s]  Hey, did you-
[10433.64s -> 10434.64s]  Hockey man, did you do-
[10435.24s -> 10435.84s]  Did you know this?
[10436.54s -> 10437.34s]  Did you know this man?
[10437.44s -> 10438.64s]  Hey, did you know all this info?
[10464.25s -> 10472.24s]  Oh, how am I supposed to do this?
[10481.26s -> 10482.26s]  What would a robot like?
[10487.46s -> 10489.46s]  You're like cotton candy, so sweet.
[10497.09s -> 10497.99s]  Friends first?
[10497.99s -> 10499.29s]  I can't make any-
[10504.03s -> 10505.03s]  How does this even work?
[10508.62s -> 10509.92s]  Oh, this is a person.
[10512.14s -> 10514.34s]  Space wave trip video is so freaky.
[10514.54s -> 10515.24s]  I love it.
[10515.74s -> 10518.44s]  It's one of my favorite bands and definitely one of my favorite-
[10518.44s -> 10519.14s]  Favorite band?
[10522.77s -> 10523.97s]  I'm gonna run in a marathon.
[10524.17s -> 10524.77s]  Good luck.
[10524.77s -> 10526.77s]  That's one of the toughest athletic events ever.
[10527.17s -> 10527.57s]  Okay.
[10528.89s -> 10530.59s]  How about that football game last night?
[10530.69s -> 10532.29s]  It was an awesome display of skill.
[10532.29s -> 10533.39s]  It was a great game.
[10533.39s -> 10535.19s]  And I was cheering all the way through.
[10537.90s -> 10538.50s]  All right.
[10540.62s -> 10542.02s]  How about piranhas?
[10542.02s -> 10543.02s]  Should I give facts?
[10544.20s -> 10545.30s]  How about a new puppy?
[10547.20s -> 10549.00s]  This is an AI-generated conversation.
[10549.00s -> 10549.70s]  Yeah, it is.
[10549.70s -> 10551.50s]  Because it's two AIs talking to each other.
[10552.27s -> 10555.07s]  Created in a video game with pre-scripted dialogue.
[10555.07s -> 10556.27s]  So you're absolutely correct.
[10556.27s -> 10557.27s]  They're all robots.
[10563.90s -> 10564.30s]  Okay.
[10564.98s -> 10565.78s]  What about penguins?
[10570.52s -> 10571.12s]  I didn't like that.
[10571.12s -> 10571.92s]  What about hamsters?
[10572.42s -> 10575.82s]  I got two hamsters as a birthday present and now there are 27 of them.
[10576.82s -> 10577.22s]  What?
[10577.22s -> 10579.32s]  A hamster once peed on my head.
[10579.72s -> 10580.22s]  How?
[10584.61s -> 10586.91s]  Monkeys have to be one of the smartest animals on the planet.
[10587.39s -> 10589.79s]  Put a hat on you and you'd be a dead ringer for a monkey.
[10589.79s -> 10592.49s]  Oh, okay.
[10592.99s -> 10593.49s]  Ow.
[10594.19s -> 10594.79s]  Ouch.
[10596.05s -> 10597.05s]  Have a great day at the park.
[10597.25s -> 10597.75s]  Ooh.
[10598.45s -> 10599.05s]  That was pain-
[10599.05s -> 10600.15s]  I felt that one.
[10600.75s -> 10601.45s]  That was painful.
[10611.89s -> 10612.39s]  Hello.
[10614.14s -> 10616.44s]  Is this person here with a family?
[10616.74s -> 10620.34s]  It's gonna be rage inside the steel cage when wrestling comes to the local coliseum.
[10620.84s -> 10622.14s]  I like to see the women wrestlers.
[10622.14s -> 10623.24s]  They're really something.
[10623.24s -> 10624.24s]  I guess it's looking over here.
[10626.36s -> 10626.66s]  All right.
[10626.66s -> 10627.76s]  Do you like penguins?
[10627.76s -> 10629.26s]  I'd love to see penguins at the zoo.
[10629.26s -> 10631.84s]  I wish I could pet a penguin.
[10631.84s -> 10632.44s]  All right.
[10632.54s -> 10633.04s]  Okay.
[10633.04s -> 10634.04s]  You like penguins.
[10634.04s -> 10634.44s]  Very cool.
[10634.44s -> 10635.24s]  What about piranhas?
[10635.88s -> 10638.58s]  Nah, too, too much.
[10639.28s -> 10639.78s]  Barbecue.
[10639.88s -> 10640.98s]  Everybody loves a good barbecue.
[10640.98s -> 10642.44s]  I went to one last week.
[10643.42s -> 10647.72s]  There's something so great about eating something hot and fresh off the grill.
[10647.72s -> 10648.22s]  Okay.
[10648.72s -> 10649.62s]  What about spicy food?
[10649.62s -> 10651.02s]  You can't go wrong with spicy foods.
[10651.02s -> 10656.32s]  Spicy food, chicken wings, jambalaya.
[10656.32s -> 10657.12s]  What is he saying?
[10657.12s -> 10658.22s]  He's just trying to talk to me.
[10659.90s -> 10661.20s]  Did you get the game last night?
[10667.70s -> 10668.20s]  Okay.
[10668.20s -> 10669.10s]  I got an old cat.
[10675.60s -> 10676.40s]  You like rhinos?
[10676.40s -> 10677.80s]  This is going to go to animals.
[10683.84s -> 10684.24s]  All right.
[10685.14s -> 10686.14s]  What about seafood?
[10695.84s -> 10696.14s]  Okay.
[10700.92s -> 10702.42s]  All right, all right, all right, all right.
[10702.42s -> 10703.22s]  We like food.
[10703.22s -> 10703.72s]  We get it.
[10703.72s -> 10704.32s]  So how do we...
[10704.98s -> 10705.38s]  How do I...
[10706.54s -> 10707.34s]  I just made friends.
[10707.34s -> 10707.64s]  I did...
[10707.64s -> 10708.04s]  Okay.
[10708.64s -> 10709.44s]  I did that wrong.
[10709.54s -> 10709.94s]  That was...
[10709.94s -> 10710.24s]  I...
[10710.24s -> 10710.74s]  It's got to...
[10710.74s -> 10711.14s]  All right.
[10711.34s -> 10711.64s]  It's...
[10711.64s -> 10712.14s]  How about...
[10712.54s -> 10712.94s]  Um...
[10714.67s -> 10715.07s]  I need...
[10721.91s -> 10722.81s]  That was an adult.
[10723.45s -> 10723.85s]  Oh.
[10725.57s -> 10726.77s]  Are you going to call me a monkey?
[10734.87s -> 10735.27s]  Okay.
[10735.97s -> 10736.67s]  What about pets?
[10742.50s -> 10742.90s]  Okay.
[10744.50s -> 10745.30s]  You like hamburgers?
[10747.90s -> 10748.20s]  Nope.
[10748.80s -> 10749.70s]  Wait, it's a robot.
[10750.20s -> 10751.55s]  I could do...
[10751.85s -> 10752.35s]  Oh.
[10761.16s -> 10765.84s]  I just want this stupid trophy.
[10766.64s -> 10771.26s]  Oh, I remember you.
[10772.66s -> 10777.80s]  Addy just gave 50 community subs.
[10777.80s -> 10786.30s]  Oh my God.
[10787.30s -> 10788.40s]  That's too much.
[10788.90s -> 10789.70s]  That's insane.
[10790.20s -> 10790.60s]  Thank you.
[10790.60s -> 10791.20s]  Too much.
[10791.20s -> 10792.30s]  Way too much.
[10800.80s -> 10801.30s]  Okay.
[10801.30s -> 10803.85s]  Well, do you like hamsters?
[10803.85s -> 10806.05s]  Oh, did one pee on your head one time?
[10813.64s -> 10816.14s]  This is my favorite subject, and I really like going to English class.
[10816.54s -> 10819.14s]  I hate doing lessons on grammar and punctuation.
[10819.14s -> 10819.54s]  Okay.
[10821.54s -> 10821.84s]  What about...
[10821.84s -> 10822.54s]  I got tickets.
[10822.54s -> 10824.24s]  I'm taking my friend to the Hickchick's concert next week.
[10824.24s -> 10827.05s]  I saw them live last week.
[10827.05s -> 10827.45s]  All right.
[10828.25s -> 10829.05s]  Do you know any languages?
[10829.05s -> 10831.20s]  I don't think I can learn a foreign language in school.
[10831.20s -> 10832.50s]  My Spanish is terrible.
[10832.60s -> 10834.86s]  I don't think of a language.
[10834.86s -> 10835.26s]  Okay.
[10835.56s -> 10836.46s]  Do you like spicy food?
[10836.46s -> 10837.66s]  I don't think I can get along with spicy foods.
[10837.66s -> 10841.85s]  I have to drink a ton of water to put out the...
[10841.85s -> 10842.85s]  Well, that's your problem.
[10842.85s -> 10845.45s]  What you should be doing is have a glass of milk and don't swallow the milk.
[10845.45s -> 10847.25s]  You swish it around your mouth and spit it out.
[10848.39s -> 10848.99s]  Milk will...
[10849.49s -> 10851.39s]  With the enzymes in milk will help break down
[10851.93s -> 10853.33s]  the spiciness of the food.
[10853.63s -> 10860.04s]  But if you swallow it, then you don't want to swallow it because it goes down.
[10865.87s -> 10866.77s]  Milk ruins the fun.
[10873.66s -> 10874.06s]  Are you...
[10874.46s -> 10875.56s]  I'm telling you that...
[10876.68s -> 10878.68s]  I think I learned that from Alton Brown.
[10879.68s -> 10881.68s]  Who is way smarter than you when it comes to food.

[10955.56s -> 10956.06s]  Forever.

[10960.97s -> 10961.37s]  Okay.
[10962.30s -> 10964.30s]  Normally, I wouldn't go out with someone cuter than myself.

[11096.23s -> 11097.03s]  They did.
[11097.13s -> 11097.83s]  Elephants.
[11100.11s -> 11100.71s]  Wow.

[11146.75s -> 11148.15s]  I feel like this is kind of weird.
[11148.15s -> 11149.55s]  It's a weird conversation.
[11154.52s -> 11155.92s]  We that's all we've talked about.

[11256.81s -> 11257.71s]  What the fuck?
[11257.71s -> 11259.71s]  I have no other conversation pieces.
[11259.71s -> 11261.61s]  We've done every single option.
[11277.31s -> 11278.11s]  No.

[11315.55s -> 11316.05s]  It's the best.
[11316.05s -> 11317.05s]  It's best way to eat pizza.
[11317.53s -> 11319.23s]  I don't like the doughy thick doughy shit.

[11356.18s -> 11360.28s]  I thought I saw salty parrot and I was like, we're not talking about eating parrots, right?
[11360.88s -> 11361.88s]  Why does it say that?
[11362.84s -> 11364.14s]  I don't want to talk about that.
[11364.14s -> 11365.54s]  I was like, why does it say salty?
[11371.77s -> 11372.17s]  Okay, we're out.

[11385.21s -> 11385.91s]  We're both in.
[11385.91s -> 11386.81s]  We both like food.
[11387.71s -> 11389.31s]  I think that we should have some pizza.
[11389.31s -> 11390.21s]  I think pizza is perfect.
[11396.48s -> 11396.88s]  Okay.
[11400.18s -> 11402.08s]  They're having a big chili festival next week.
[11402.08s -> 11402.98s]  Would you like to go?
[11416.25s -> 11416.75s]  Okay.
[11419.21s -> 11420.41s]  I am also pretty good.

[11435.15s -> 11435.65s]  You know that?
[11437.70s -> 11439.10s]  Bonzo-palooza?
[11444.12s -> 11445.92s]  You got a great, I think you got a pretty good sense of humor.

[11452.66s -> 11453.06s]  All right.
[11454.38s -> 11459.39s]  What about, you should see me run the mile.
[11459.39s -> 11459.79s]  No.
[11460.29s -> 11461.19s]  We should go see a movie.
[11461.19s -> 11461.69s]  I don't know.
[11461.69s -> 11462.59s]  I don't think I know yet.

[11485.21s -> 11485.61s]  No.
[11485.71s -> 11487.21s]  None of these dumb one-liners.
[11487.71s -> 11488.21s]  Stupid.
[11488.61s -> 11490.91s]  I write my own songs and I was thinking I should write one about you.
[11490.91s -> 11491.81s]  Don't do that.
[11491.91s -> 11492.31s]  No.
[11493.81s -> 11494.31s]  No, thank you.
[11494.31s -> 11494.91s]  Don't do that.
[11495.31s -> 11497.41s]  Do you think we'll ever see the return of polka music?
[11497.41s -> 11497.91s]  That's fun.
[11499.45s -> 11500.65s]  Lert mini game.
[11505.03s -> 11505.53s]  Huh?
[11507.22s -> 11508.02s]  What am I trying to do?
[11510.84s -> 11511.44s]  Money?
[11512.94s -> 11514.04s]  I have to hit the bag of money?
[11515.38s -> 11517.38s]  Oh, that's very long travel time.
[11517.88s -> 11517.98s]  All right.
[11517.98s -> 11518.68s]  I got the bag of money.
[11519.80s -> 11520.40s]  I need a heart.
[11522.77s -> 11523.37s]  Another one of those.
[11523.67s -> 11524.27s]  A lip.
[11527.34s -> 11527.64s]  All right.
[11527.64s -> 11528.44s]  I need another right here.
[11529.24s -> 11529.64s]  Shit.
[11531.60s -> 11532.90s]  Money, money, money, money, money, money, money.
[11535.11s -> 11535.61s]  No.
[11535.81s -> 11536.21s]  Money.
[11536.41s -> 11537.21s]  This is so hard.
[11539.59s -> 11539.99s]  Money.
[11540.69s -> 11542.19s]  It's going so fast.
[11544.02s -> 11545.62s]  I can't even see what I'm shooting at.
[11547.31s -> 11547.91s]  Don't move.
[11551.01s -> 11552.31s]  Dude, what?
[11559.38s -> 11559.88s]  Headphones.
[11561.06s -> 11561.46s]  Headphones.
[11563.53s -> 11564.03s]  How'd it go?
[11567.79s -> 11568.59s]  I think it went pretty well.
[11581.01s -> 11581.41s]  All right.
[11585.27s -> 11585.67s]  Money.
[11586.40s -> 11587.10s]  No, not telephone.
[11587.10s -> 11587.50s]  Money.
[11589.32s -> 11589.82s]  Money.
[11591.74s -> 11592.44s]  Another bag of money.
[11598.46s -> 11599.06s]  Another lip.
[11599.63s -> 11600.23s]  And headphones.
[11601.77s -> 11602.57s]  They change on you.
[11602.57s -> 11603.17s]  They change on you.
[11603.17s -> 11603.77s]  It's horse shit.
[11616.10s -> 11616.60s]  Money again.
[11618.17s -> 11618.67s]  Money again.
[11620.14s -> 11620.54s]  All right.
[11622.21s -> 11623.11s]  We're sweethearts.
[11632.04s -> 11633.24s]  We're at max attraction.
[11633.64s -> 11633.94s]  All right.
[11633.94s -> 11635.24s]  It sounds like we're raisins.
[11641.64s -> 11643.74s]  I am involved in a lot of after-school activities.
[11647.30s -> 11648.30s]  What does a raisin mean?
[11651.54s -> 11651.94s]  All right.
[11653.44s -> 11653.94s]  Wait, what?
[11659.76s -> 11661.06s]  Did I complete the game yet?
[11661.06s -> 11662.06s]  Did I complete the minigame?
[11666.76s -> 11668.76s]  She's really thirsty and really hungry.
[11675.12s -> 11675.82s]  Does this win?
[11679.06s -> 11681.16s]  I think our lips were made to be together.
[11681.76s -> 11682.26s]  Okay.
[11684.53s -> 11685.53s]  Let me cook dinner for you.
[11685.63s -> 11686.97s]  The great pasta dish.
[11686.97s -> 11688.07s]  I am telling you right now.
[11689.92s -> 11690.42s]  I don't know.
[11690.82s -> 11693.22s]  They're like, I don't know, 14 or 15 or 16 or something.
[11693.22s -> 11695.42s]  I don't know, but you don't make great pasta.
[11696.67s -> 11699.17s]  No, like 16 year old makes great pasta.
[11699.57s -> 11701.07s]  No, like 17 or 18 year old.
[11701.07s -> 11704.01s]  Nobody makes great pasta when they're like fucking 15.
[11714.34s -> 11714.64s]  Okay.
[11715.69s -> 11716.79s]  So am I done?
[11729.69s -> 11732.89s]  Yeah, like what I was, what I should have said is
[11733.09s -> 11734.99s]  and my mom makes a really good pasta.
[11746.03s -> 11747.53s]  It has to be a robot.
[11753.26s -> 11755.46s]  It does have to be a robot.
[11761.39s -> 11762.49s]  Oh my God.
[11768.79s -> 11770.69s]  I don't think I can, how do you even do that?
[11775.59s -> 11777.49s]  How do I flirt with a robot?
[11778.46s -> 11780.36s]  This is weird by itself, by the way.
[11788.57s -> 11790.37s]  What about your world famous pasta though, man?
[11790.37s -> 11791.67s]  Oh yeah, world famous pasta.
[11802.56s -> 11803.86s]  I don't, I can't do any of this.
[11805.08s -> 11806.08s]  They don't care about anything.
[11811.74s -> 11823.32s]  Is there one that is supposed, is the one that just works?
[11826.71s -> 11828.61s]  Great humor, brum.
[11831.56s -> 11833.96s]  I would think the alien invasion one would be, right?
[11835.06s -> 11835.76s]  Prison food.
[11843.17s -> 11844.37s]  It has to be an adult woman.
[11844.47s -> 11845.47s]  No, it's not.
[11845.57s -> 11847.07s]  What are you talking about, man?
[11849.22s -> 11850.32s]  What are you talking about?
[11860.60s -> 11866.74s]  I was gonna, I don't, I need to look at this.
[11866.74s -> 11867.54s]  I need to look this up.
[11869.58s -> 11870.78s]  Robo losers.
[11872.97s -> 11873.97s]  Robo love.
[11878.61s -> 11881.51s]  Oh, I just have to do it three times.
[11882.12s -> 11884.52s]  I thought I had to have a robot like,
[11885.12s -> 11886.92s]  girlfriend or boyfriend or something.
[11887.32s -> 11890.62s]  I thought I had to actually like go out with a robot.
[11899.07s -> 11899.37s]  Okay.
[11899.37s -> 11900.87s]  Well, I got 7,900 bucks.
[11900.87s -> 11902.17s]  It's time to make some coasters.
[11908.45s -> 11909.55s]  I got some new rides to do.
[11911.25s -> 11912.05s]  Let's put one right here.
[11913.44s -> 11914.34s]  A lot of people are hungry.
[11914.34s -> 11915.64s]  So it's time to get more pizza.
[11917.89s -> 11919.09s]  How many people at the park are hungry?
[11925.62s -> 11926.62s]  Pizza, donuts.
[11933.32s -> 11933.72s]  Okay.
[11934.72s -> 11936.12s]  And maybe some water.
[11936.22s -> 11937.62s]  Oh, yeah, people are thirsty too.
[11940.44s -> 11940.64s]  Okay.
[11941.54s -> 11943.24s]  Those, they can stay at the default prices.
[11943.24s -> 11943.54s]  It's fine.
[11948.67s -> 11949.27s]  Alright, mission.
[11949.27s -> 11952.75s]  So we got games, questing 101.
[11956.82s -> 11957.52s]  I don't want to do that.
[11960.40s -> 11961.60s]  Do some crazy stunts.
[11964.92s -> 11968.72s]  Tim Twinklefingers claims he's the best alleyball bowler in Thrillville.
[11968.82s -> 11970.72s]  Oh, let's go show him up right now.
[11971.63s -> 11972.63s]  Going on Twinklefingers.
[11977.13s -> 11979.53s]  It's the weirdest way to introduce yourself, but that's fine.
[11985.42s -> 11986.72s]  Ooh, good one.
[11991.38s -> 11991.98s]  Embarrassed.
[11998.89s -> 11999.09s]  All right.
[11999.09s -> 11999.79s]  Let's kick his ass.
[12008.35s -> 12008.85s]  It's this thing.
[12008.85s -> 12009.25s]  I'm going to lose.
[12010.89s -> 12011.99s]  You should go smoke a bowl.
[12016.82s -> 12023.84s]  God, it's so hard.
[12024.24s -> 12028.00s]  I feel like the mouse is probably better, but I can't, by the way,
[12028.00s -> 12030.80s]  if you're going to buy this game and you have more than one monitor,
[12030.90s -> 12031.50s]  don't buy it.
[12031.50s -> 12034.99s]  Unless you have a controller, you cannot play this game with your
[12034.99s -> 12042.74s]  mouse, if you have two monitors, your mouse is still being captured
[12042.74s -> 12044.44s]  by your desktop, no matter what you do.
[12045.91s -> 12048.81s]  So when you, it'll, if you, you'll move the mouse around in the game
[12048.91s -> 12050.41s]  and you'll see it on your other monitors.
[12050.41s -> 12051.71s]  And if you click, it'll exit the window.
[12058.37s -> 12059.37s]  There are fixes for that.
[12060.60s -> 12061.20s]  How did that miss?
[12061.70s -> 12067.66s]  Just turn the other monitors off.
[12068.06s -> 12069.06s]  Yeah, but that's a pain in the ass.
[12070.02s -> 12071.12s]  This game was on PS2.
[12071.12s -> 12072.52s]  I'm going to play it the way it was meant to be played.
[12080.47s -> 12080.87s]  Get in there.
[12081.77s -> 12081.97s]  All right.
[12081.97s -> 12082.57s]  That's a full clear.
[12084.02s -> 12084.32s]  Again.
[12087.54s -> 12088.14s]  Come on.
[12092.01s -> 12092.51s]  Get up there.
[12092.91s -> 12093.41s]  Full clear.
[12093.41s -> 12093.81s]  Come on.
[12094.87s -> 12095.27s]  Nice.
[12097.30s -> 12097.60s]  Sorry.
[12097.60s -> 12097.90s]  Sorry.
[12101.84s -> 12103.14s]  It's always those ones are so hard.
[12105.04s -> 12106.44s]  I'm not going to be able to hit any either one of these.
[12111.34s -> 12112.04s]  Come on.
[12118.16s -> 12127.10s]  Get in there.
[12127.60s -> 12128.10s]  Did I win?
[12132.57s -> 12132.97s]  I beat him.
[12134.60s -> 12135.30s]  It was so easy.
[12139.93s -> 12141.03s]  Oh, your time will come.
[12141.13s -> 12142.13s]  You can be sure of that.
[12144.08s -> 12145.18s]  Oh, I got a rubber chicken.
[12146.38s -> 12146.68s]  Nice.
[12150.12s -> 12150.82s]  Oh, it's Moe.
[12150.82s -> 12151.12s]  Okay.
[12151.32s -> 12152.12s]  Thanks for the review.
[12153.25s -> 12154.15s]  Were you waving me down?
[12154.15s -> 12154.55s]  What's up?
[12158.65s -> 12159.45s]  Why would you wave me down?
[12162.53s -> 12163.63s]  I got $8,000.
[12168.82s -> 12169.22s]  Crash.
[12171.41s -> 12172.21s]  Oh, okay.
[12172.21s -> 12172.61s]  Hold on.
[12177.03s -> 12177.23s]  Up.
[12177.33s -> 12178.43s]  Oh, I haven't done any upkeep.
[12179.53s -> 12180.33s]  Lindsay's notes.
[12181.74s -> 12188.48s]  Lindsay knows has left her valuable notes on hotdog physics all around Thrillville.
[12188.48s -> 12190.08s]  Find those notes and Lindsay will be so grateful.
[12190.08s -> 12191.98s]  She'll gladly help you with your robot problem.
[12192.28s -> 12192.48s]  All right.
[12192.48s -> 12193.08s]  I need one more.
[12198.17s -> 12200.47s]  Just get those robots to buy lots and lots of balloons.
[12203.45s -> 12204.75s]  Oh, I don't want to do that.
[12207.64s -> 12208.24s]  Build the robot.
[12208.44s -> 12208.94s]  Okay.
[12209.88s -> 12210.68s]  Train a mechanic.
[12210.88s -> 12211.28s]  All right.
[12211.38s -> 12212.08s]  Mechanic train.
[12213.31s -> 12214.31s]  I don't even have a mechanic.
[12218.16s -> 12218.96s]  I don't have a mechanic.
[12223.92s -> 12224.82s]  There's only one person.
[12226.43s -> 12226.63s]  All right.
[12226.63s -> 12227.03s]  Train.
[12240.17s -> 12241.27s]  Build its reliability.
[12241.27s -> 12242.07s]  Maintain the ride.
[12244.34s -> 12247.84s]  The circuit pieces are not already placed in the order in which they have to be positioned.
[12248.90s -> 12250.10s]  I don't have any staff.
[12252.51s -> 12253.01s]  Oh my God.
[12253.01s -> 12253.91s]  This is going to be horrible.
[12258.68s -> 12258.98s]  What?
[12265.10s -> 12265.40s]  Okay.
[12268.86s -> 12269.26s]  Who's did it?
[12278.17s -> 12278.77s]  Holy shit.
[12282.50s -> 12283.90s]  Oh, it gets weirder.
[12284.90s -> 12285.70s]  It gets weird.
[12290.15s -> 12290.35s]  No, no, no.
[12290.35s -> 12290.75s]  Go back.
[12290.85s -> 12291.45s]  How do I delete?
[12293.02s -> 12293.62s]  Oh, I can't.
[12315.36s -> 12316.46s]  Is this, am I doing that?
[12318.96s -> 12319.36s]  I don't get it.
[12321.15s -> 12321.65s]  Wait, what?
[12323.00s -> 12323.50s]  I go back.
[12343.17s -> 12343.57s]  Hey!
[12353.14s -> 12353.34s]  All right.
[12353.34s -> 12353.84s]  They trained.
[12355.21s -> 12355.91s]  79 training.
[12355.91s -> 12356.31s]  That's good.
[12360.94s -> 12361.94s]  I need some more staff, right?
[12365.75s -> 12365.95s]  Okay.
[12365.95s -> 12366.75s]  I have a mechanic.
[12367.67s -> 12368.77s]  I need a groundskeeper.
[12371.56s -> 12371.96s]  Wait.
[12372.36s -> 12373.46s]  You're already a mechanic.
[12375.69s -> 12375.89s]  All right.
[12375.89s -> 12376.29s]  Train.
[12388.60s -> 12389.20s]  What are they wearing?
[12392.21s -> 12394.01s]  They're wearing, what are those things they're wearing on their heads?
[12394.01s -> 12394.51s]  What is that?
[12402.04s -> 12405.74s]  I feel like that's kind of, they're wearing like, like plastic bags on their heads.
[12405.74s -> 12406.64s]  Where's the oxygen?
[12409.30s -> 12409.90s]  What are those things?
[12409.90s -> 12411.70s]  What, there's like no oxygen in there.
[12422.78s -> 12423.48s]  Let me complete this.
[12428.92s -> 12429.82s]  Good, good, good, good, good.
[12435.00s -> 12436.60s]  It's from the underwater section.
[12436.60s -> 12437.40s]  Oh, okay.
[12437.40s -> 12438.00s]  That makes sense.
[12443.19s -> 12443.69s]  Trained up.
[12444.97s -> 12445.37s]  Very good.
[12445.37s -> 12445.67s]  Very good.
[12445.67s -> 12445.97s]  Very good.
[12445.97s -> 12446.17s]  All right.
[12446.17s -> 12447.17s]  Now we need an entertainer.
[12450.18s -> 12450.78s]  You're good.
[12454.97s -> 12455.67s]  Staff.
[12456.85s -> 12457.75s]  Entertainer.
[12459.60s -> 12460.20s]  Ethan.
[12460.97s -> 12462.47s]  These are Abigail.
[12464.07s -> 12465.07s]  I have to do this.
[12465.27s -> 12468.07s]  I know that we're going to get DMCA song, but whatever.
[12481.38s -> 12482.48s]  Oh my goodness.
[12504.05s -> 12508.87s]  This reminds me of every single live-action Disney Joe's intro.
[12513.70s -> 12515.40s]  Somebody always gets like a pie in the face.
[12520.67s -> 12522.47s]  There's always like a pie that goes in somebody's face.
[12526.54s -> 12527.84s]  Even if it's not in any episode.
[12543.30s -> 12544.80s]  Hair tied up and braids.
[12547.14s -> 12548.74s]  That was one of the worst things I've ever done.
[12555.49s -> 12556.69s]  I don't care if I'm doing bad.
[12556.69s -> 12557.29s]  It's fine.
[12557.29s -> 12557.89s]  Don't worry.
[12557.99s -> 12558.49s]  It's okay.
[12581.78s -> 12582.38s]  Hold it.
[12582.68s -> 12583.38s]  Hold it.
[12583.38s -> 12584.08s]  Hold it.
[12584.08s -> 12584.68s]  Hold it.
[12584.68s -> 12585.18s]  Release.
[12589.53s -> 12589.73s]  All right.
[12589.73s -> 12591.33s]  That's definitely going to be some good training.
[12595.16s -> 12596.46s]  I actually have staff members now.
[12596.46s -> 12597.06s]  That's fine.
[12597.06s -> 12597.46s]  All right.
[12597.46s -> 12601.40s]  So now we can get out of this.
[12603.77s -> 12604.67s]  I got 10 grand.
[12605.72s -> 12606.02s]  There it is.
[12616.13s -> 12616.83s]  Danger.
[12627.16s -> 12629.56s]  So how do we take care of the robots?
[12630.34s -> 12631.64s]  That just burped really loud.
[12632.34s -> 12633.14s]  Speed pool.
[12636.88s -> 12637.38s]  Okay.
[12639.36s -> 12640.06s]  I'm thinking giant.
[12640.06s -> 12640.96s]  I want to build another coaster.
[12648.06s -> 12648.66s]  What do you guys think?
[12650.66s -> 12651.46s]  I think I want to do giant.
[12656.52s -> 12657.52s]  Thrill build giant.
[12679.27s -> 12680.07s]  Is the game too quiet?
[12680.07s -> 12680.57s]  I turned it up.
[12681.69s -> 12682.59s]  The music was too loud.
[12682.59s -> 12684.59s]  I turned, I went in the game engine and turned it down.
[12684.59s -> 12684.99s]  So we're good.
[12686.06s -> 12689.56s]  Is this an actual person or is that an animatronic?
[12692.07s -> 12693.97s]  That would be a really scary animatronic.
[12695.90s -> 12697.50s]  It would be so horrifying and unsettling.
[12697.50s -> 12698.30s]  I would hate that.
[12699.29s -> 12699.49s]  All right.
[12699.49s -> 12700.49s]  Let's get a coaster built here.
[12700.99s -> 12701.99s]  Only 2000 bucks.
[12701.99s -> 12702.59s]  Give me a break.
[12704.02s -> 12704.52s]  I can afford it.
[12709.17s -> 12709.87s]  Andy drop.
[12713.54s -> 12714.24s]  Wagon.
[12714.74s -> 12716.04s]  Wild mouse coaster.
[12716.54s -> 12717.94s]  Oh, we have to make this crazy.
[12718.04s -> 12718.44s]  Yep.
[12719.59s -> 12721.19s]  I'm going to make this all over the place.
[12724.27s -> 12725.47s]  Let's take it this way first.
[12742.36s -> 12743.06s]  Oh my God.
[12754.98s -> 12755.98s]  I want it to go up.
[12758.40s -> 12762.20s]  At what miles per hour do the insides of a human liquidate?
[12765.75s -> 12767.95s]  It's got to be more than like five, six, seven hundred, right?
[12776.10s -> 12776.70s]  Still too high.
[12781.68s -> 12787.38s]  An airplane goes, it's a pressurized cabin, but that goes like four, three hundred miles per hour, four hundred miles per hour.
[12789.77s -> 12790.67s]  Oh, I'm out of bounds.
[12790.67s -> 12790.97s]  Okay.
[12790.97s -> 12791.47s]  Okay.
[12797.18s -> 12799.23s]  Depends on acceleration.
[12803.10s -> 12805.60s]  Now let's have them go through like ten of those walls.
[12807.01s -> 12807.98s]  Right here.
[12819.33s -> 12820.33s]  Vertical overhang.
[12820.33s -> 12821.13s]  Whoa.

[12872.31s -> 12873.31s]  I'm going to make this crazy.
[12874.68s -> 12876.18s]  Maybe this would be a little tighter.
[12876.68s -> 12888.60s]  You think people are going to fly off this?
[12888.60s -> 12899.12s]  Okay, that should be fine.

[12919.31s -> 12926.78s]  Oh, shit.
[12926.78s -> 12930.47s]  Where's the end over here?
[12930.47s -> 12934.53s]  I'm running out of money.
[12934.53s -> 12939.42s]  What are you talking about?

[12970.11s -> 12972.12s]  Oh, wait a minute.
[12972.42s -> 12974.96s]  It's one of these.
[12976.78s -> 12981.59s]  Oh, I thought, okay.
[12981.59s -> 12983.19s]  So this thing can spin freely.

[13241.88s -> 13244.18s]  This kind of reminds me of one of those games you would download
[13244.18s -> 13245.88s]  and have a virus baked into it.
[13248.68s -> 13251.18s]  I mean, the game still existed, but it was a virus.

[13574.30s -> 13584.56s]  All right, people are starving and thirsty and need to go to the bathroom
[13584.56s -> 13597.90s]  I thought there were nine people in the whole park. I want to go to

[14030.62s -> 14043.54s]  Oh, it's cuz I didn't have another park unlocked. All right. Let me do that. All right
[14043.54s -> 14059.93s]  We're gonna go to thrillville stunts a lot of people here watch it. People are really thirsty. I got it. I'm on it
[14060.17s -> 14079.88s]  Okay, I gotta find a good place to put the bandit game probably over here. All right, bandito chinchilla
[14079.92s -> 14091.11s]  It's already built where you can juggle enemies in the air
[14091.43s -> 14097.32s]  All right jump weak attack pick up item use attack and strong attack

[14150.56s -> 14164.98s]  Okay, I get it let's go points combo it's like castle crashers
[14165.98s -> 14176.74s]  What a great game that is by the way. I wish they made a castle crashes, too
[14177.06s -> 14184.31s]  I know you can't really make that game any better than you but still I would love to have seen another one
[14184.31s -> 14186.31s]  You're hiding behind the cactus. Oh
[14192.38s -> 14220.10s]  El lizard is boss. No, not really a guitar el tortoise
[14220.22s -> 14245.80s]  All right, it's ass el lizard plus fell off plus ratio. I want some more weapons

[14264.36s -> 14266.81s]  Got a juggle
[14266.81s -> 14278.19s]  In this an amusement park game, this is one of the arcade games in the amusement park game
[14278.55s -> 14288.47s]  What does plus two mean? Oh
[14289.60s -> 14292.52s]  We're gonna explain that a lot of new people on this stream
[14297.69s -> 14299.69s]  plus two and minus two are
[14300.37s -> 14304.01s]  a way to gauge how much the chat room has
[14304.77s -> 14309.41s]  has agreed or disagreed with how comedic or funny the last thing that I said was or
[14310.17s -> 14313.41s]  Sometimes they they abuse it and they do minus two
[14313.97s -> 14318.99s]  Based on something that somebody in the game says like I don't even say it but apparently it's my fault for showing it
[14318.99s -> 14329.61s]  I don't understand
[14329.65s -> 14341.14s]  Where's face cam? Fuck you. You want a face cam? You want to turn the face cam on you really want that?

[14370.47s -> 14376.10s]  Oh
[14385.50s -> 14387.50s]  You know, it's fine, you know like Golden Axe
[14387.86s -> 14391.46s]  Have you guys ever played Golden Axe for real and not just for five seconds on?
[14391.86s -> 14395.22s]  Like an emulator that you have or something. Have you ever played through that game?
[14395.22s -> 14407.04s]  I don't think that game is actually possible to beat. I don't think it's possible that probably would have been
[14407.80s -> 14409.80s]  fifty to a hundred dollars in the machine
[14410.08s -> 14415.52s]  The final boss in that game is not possible to not die at least five to ten times at least
[14416.12s -> 14430.40s]  How come chat wants me to show my face because I've never done it before and I've been waiting for a face reveal
[14430.40s -> 14435.08s]  I've been trying I've been hyping it up ever since I had like only a few hundred viewers
[14435.08s -> 14438.40s]  I've been hyping up a face reveal and people like show it already do it already and I'm like
[14440.52s -> 14447.68s]  It's like alright eventually I will and maybe I'll just do it. Maybe I'll just do it today
[14448.20s -> 14459.89s]  You could please do it today. You know what?
[14460.41s -> 14463.84s]  I'll do it today. It's gonna be really kind of nervous about it though
[14464.48s -> 14476.09s]  I don't know you never know what somebody's gonna say about you right like oh, that's not how I thought you're gonna look
[14476.09s -> 14490.24s]  That's not what I thought you look like and I get it right you have like an image of what you think I look like
[14496.72s -> 14518.92s]  2022 is the year. Yeah, what about your face emotes? What is this? Um, well, I
[14520.56s -> 14524.21s]  Mean that's not my face though. I

[14531.03s -> 14534.54s]  All those that you're seeing a really heavily edited
[14535.93s -> 14537.93s]  exaggerated features and
[14542.11s -> 14561.34s]  Eltoad I always imagined you being over six feet tall. That's what I mean. This game's fun
[14572.05s -> 14575.52s]  Job

[14597.56s -> 14599.56s]  That one's way too much
[14605.13s -> 14610.08s]  These are just all like inside of the toilet bowl sound I can't do these
[14610.68s -> 14627.76s]  face reveal
[14627.76s -> 14630.00s]  Stop stop it. No
[14631.20s -> 14643.32s]  Okay
[14643.32s -> 14644.40s]  Okay
[14644.40s -> 14674.51s]  You see me. You see me Wow. Do you look completely different? You're not what I thought you looked like at all Wow, dude, really?
[14675.11s -> 14685.28s]  That's what I mean. This is why I didn't want to fucking do it because
[14685.92s -> 14689.36s]  Now like now everybody knows and whatever it's just fucking annoying
[14689.92s -> 14700.95s]  I'm like mom like I'm like really no one's ever seen that before
[14707.60s -> 14712.12s]  Like the lizards
[14713.28s -> 14726.70s]  That was the worst joke it's not even my joke you can't count that as my joke, this is your joke
[14727.18s -> 14732.28s]  I'm just enabling you. That's the difference
[14732.80s -> 14749.49s]  Is that I do this is not my joke. I'm enabling your joke. What though? When does Elden ring come out?
[14759.07s -> 14774.91s]  That's such a you just said tomorrow, and I don't know why I thought that was funny February 1
[14775.51s -> 14781.13s]  I'm gonna play the hell out of that when that comes out. You better believe it
[14781.65s -> 14799.78s]  Comes out in 45 minutes hell. I'm how much further in the game do I have to go? This is like an entire game
[14800.62s -> 14808.37s]  Okay, I can't hit this
[14808.37s -> 14824.86s]  Elden rings gonna be awesome. It got delayed again. No, it didn't it actually I don't remember hearing that
[14826.06s -> 14834.63s]  February 24th. Yeah
[14835.35s -> 14841.82s]  The stunt rider minigame after this
[14847.98s -> 14858.22s]  We don't
[14859.14s -> 14870.99s]  Take I can go fast
[14872.35s -> 14880.13s]  Do blood-borne stream I would if it was 60 FPS. I don't think the game can even be 60 FPS, right?
[14880.13s -> 14889.15s]  I would do a blood-borne playthrough for you guys. And those of you don't know that's one of my favorite games ever made
[14889.67s -> 14892.04s]  I've beaten that game probably ten times
[14892.60s -> 14900.50s]  At least it's one of my favorite single-player games ever. It probably is my favorite single-player game ever made. I
[14901.90s -> 14905.82s]  Cannot play it again. I don't want to if it does a 60 FPS update
[14905.82s -> 14931.02s]  And I will have it's a reason for you to do it again now get up eat frozen fruits. Oh
[14932.83s -> 14938.37s]  It like a smoothie. I don't just eat them out of the bag or something. I put them in a smoothie
[14940.25s -> 14946.30s]  Remember this game doesn't end it has to
[14946.98s -> 14959.26s]  frozen food is
[14959.26s -> 14961.26s]  frozen food is delicious
[14962.48s -> 14965.88s]  Why are you eating frozen? Why are you eating frozen food?
[14971.26s -> 14988.17s]  Frozen if you just eat it you can bite into it. All right, let's do it ice cream. That's not the same thing
[14991.15s -> 14999.98s]  Ice cream is not even frozen solid. It's at the certain temperature. It's still you can still mush it around
[14999.98s -> 15001.98s]  It's not frozen
[15003.88s -> 15015.11s]  It's very very cold, but it's not it's not a frozen solid piece that's not frozen
[15022.66s -> 15032.81s]  I can hurt each other. Okay. This is getting actually pretty tricky. You're gonna move popsicle popsicle is frozen
[15033.21s -> 15046.32s]  At what temperature does ice cream freeze solid somebody look it up at what temperature is ice cream?
[15046.32s -> 15062.74s]  Does does milk freeze like that zero Celsius? It's the cream. Yeah. Yeah. Oh
[15064.12s -> 15066.71s]  She's the boomerang
[15066.71s -> 15075.93s]  It is a solid. No, it is a no. It is a non-Newtonian fluid. I'm it is a non-Newtonian fluid
[15076.29s -> 15102.58s]  It's not solid nor is it liquid I like frozen pizza. Yeah, but you're not eating it frozen
[15106.83s -> 15129.89s]  Frozen is solid defrosted equals liquid is ice cream frozen ice cream is a sweetened
[15130.89s -> 15133.69s]  Non-Newtonian liquid typically eaten as a snack or dessert
[15133.69s -> 15136.41s]  It may be made from milk or cream and it's flavored with sweetener
[15136.53s -> 15143.94s]  Either sugar or an alternative and a spice such as cocoa or vanilla or with fruit such as strawberries or peaches
[15143.98s -> 15168.78s]  We're just playing semantics though. It's just a it's a game of semantics. It's a liquids
[15168.98s -> 15179.54s]  You know, I think is a weird and look I know people are gonna call me like
[15180.26s -> 15182.26s]  Two head Andy, okay
[15182.30s -> 15185.48s]  But just think about the world right it's about how interesting this is
[15186.16s -> 15189.32s]  So ice is frozen water ice
[15189.88s -> 15195.16s]  It's fra water that's been frozen. It is at a certain temperature to be solid frozen water
[15195.74s -> 15201.04s]  When you put ice cubes into water the water does not become frozen
[15201.84s -> 15208.08s]  Even if there's a hundred thousand ice cubes in the water, that's so weird doesn't it's so weird. It's interesting to me
[15213.50s -> 15218.66s]  If you have a bunch of ice cubes in water, the ice does not freeze. It's just cold water
[15220.39s -> 15221.99s]  It's so weird
[15221.99s -> 15237.48s]  It's thermodynamics. That's what I'm saying. They're gonna dynamics is weird. You know what else is weird?
[15239.97s -> 15241.57s]  an
[15241.57s -> 15242.93s]  oscilloscope
[15242.93s -> 15249.05s]  Well, we have this tube that can make lights up to blow up on to make a tube on your television to have an image
[15249.05s -> 15251.05s]  On your screen what?
[15251.09s -> 15259.24s]  You know, you guys don't know this people think that well, oh my god, imagine if we lived in a world with magic. Oh
[15260.41s -> 15263.65s]  Man, imagine that we had like lived in the Harry Potter universe. There was magic
[15264.17s -> 15274.10s]  We have magic our ability to do like electronics is just fucking magic fire is magic
[15274.80s -> 15279.24s]  Can you think about it the fact that we have steel?
[15280.16s -> 15283.22s]  We can create steel. That's literally magic. That's magic
[15283.76s -> 15289.77s]  If an alien were to come down here, imagine if they didn't even know what like a metal processing was
[15290.27s -> 15293.55s]  Or what fire was we would just we would have magical fire powers
[15294.07s -> 15305.60s]  The fact that I have the fact I'm going full cam for this one the fact I'm at like 10 FPS doesn't matter
[15305.74s -> 15308.81s]  the fact that we can
[15309.81s -> 15315.11s]  Relive our memories right now right this very moment
[15315.51s -> 15318.99s]  You see me right now on the screen I am sitting here
[15318.99s -> 15325.00s]  I'm sitting in this in this spot you can relive this exact moment right now
[15325.12s -> 15334.85s]  You can read you can see memories how crazy is that that alone should be that's magic. That's literally magic
[15335.13s -> 15339.81s]  We can take photos of stuff and just like just it's there it is
[15339.81s -> 15344.77s]  You have a you you have a physical memory that you can see it's crazy
[15345.09s -> 15359.57s]  Your urinals rotating yeah, that's to make it extra interesting when I go it's a game for me. I'm serious think about that
[15361.04s -> 15368.44s]  Imagine if aliens could didn't have like like video or photo evidence of anything. They would be so freaked out
[15368.44s -> 15372.13s]  I can you tell an alien you stand right there alien
[15372.13s -> 15375.67s]  I'd like you to I'd like you to sing the alien national anthem and they're like
[15378.20s -> 15383.12s]  And you and then you show them you videotape them and you show them doing that they're gonna go
[15384.00s -> 15386.00s]  The
[15386.00s -> 15388.86s]  Heads gonna fucking explode you're literally
[15389.38s -> 15394.76s]  Showing them a memory that they had you have burnt that into a physical medium
[15394.76s -> 15412.03s]  I'm gonna CBD gummies did you have zero the fact that we can actually capture memories is crazy
[15412.25s -> 15421.41s]  You can open this video in three months and relive this exact second of your life and my life, too
[15421.57s -> 15427.27s]  We think the aliens the aliens what if the aliens don't know shit, okay?
[15427.35s -> 15434.02s]  What if the aliens don't know shit, we think the aliens are gonna come land and they're gonna be like here's our alien technology
[15434.02s -> 15436.90s]  It's just like ultra hyper electric beam and it's time travel
[15437.02s -> 15441.38s]  What if they don't know anything and we're the ones that have all this crazy technology
[15441.50s -> 15449.71s]  Yeah, the fact that they're gonna want to take shit from us. They're gonna want to take all of our technology
[15449.71s -> 15470.90s]  We are the aliens be speaking in chapstick. I'm just saying it's crazy that we have all this like magical stuff in the world
[15473.01s -> 15475.79s]  Electricity is just magical light beams like you got like
[15476.53s -> 15484.20s]  Palpatine the fact that your refrigerator could just be powered. What if aliens don't have anything aliens could just be like
[15484.20s -> 15489.24s]  Oh, wow, you have this this thing over here that keeps your food from spoiling
[15489.76s -> 15492.64s]  Well on our planet
[15492.68s -> 15493.88s]  fructose
[15493.88s -> 15496.56s]  we have
[15497.16s -> 15504.39s]  We got stuff what's that over there wait? Oh, it's a calendar. What's that? You keep track of days and
[15505.00s -> 15507.00s]  You have this
[15507.44s -> 15511.12s]  Device in your hand tells you when your next appointment is gone
[15511.12s -> 15516.44s]  I would love to know in my next appointment with what fruit lawn was they don't know shit
[15517.05s -> 15522.73s]  Aliens don't know anything. We are alright. I'm freaking out. I'm losing my mind
[15522.73s -> 15528.91s]  But yeah, you get what I'm saying that I'm going a little too hard here, but you know what I mean
[15528.91s -> 15532.80s]  It's crazy. We have bees on this planet
[15532.84s -> 15541.43s]  There are bees think about what a bee does think about what a bee does all of you what think about what a bee does
[15543.56s -> 15550.67s]  Oh, no, that's not like we could fucked up an alien. Oh, no, this is little thing that that that pollinates plants
[15550.67s -> 15552.67s]  It it goes and collects
[15553.03s -> 15556.65s]  Dust that comes out of this weird thing that grows out of the ground by the way
[15556.91s -> 15563.74s]  this thing grows out of the ground plants are weird and then it travels and
[15564.10s -> 15571.13s]  Puts that dust on other stuff and pollinates things. There's the simple act of pollination to an alien
[15571.13s -> 15573.95s]  It would be probably absurd to them
[15573.95s -> 15583.86s]  Who knows guys the fact that you can have sounds come out of your mouth might be the most absurd thing that they've ever heard
[15585.64s -> 15591.68s]  Imagine an alien that's just sitting there watching back those. Yeah, I get it. We like what is that coming out of his mouth?
[15592.98s -> 15595.08s]  Shoot it
[15595.08s -> 15604.00s]  Like we they would like they would level us they would level us when they heard the sounds you don't know what they have and
[15604.00s -> 15611.73s]  Neither do we what's this tangent is tangent is the world we have a magical fucking world and people don't think we do
[15612.19s -> 15636.31s]  Stay right there. What what is this?
[15638.21s -> 15645.34s]  What is this? Why does this exist? This is magic powers do explain this to me
[15645.54s -> 15647.54s]  Why does this exist?
[15647.78s -> 15659.99s]  Okay, every planet has that you don't know anything about planets
[15659.99s -> 15663.39s]  All we know is we can see like Mars has a bunch of red gas all over it
[15663.39s -> 15677.31s]  You know, we don't know anything what our magnets. It's a big red planet. It's just my hands are like all dusty
[15677.31s -> 15683.83s]  Hold on. This is a big red planet with red gas all over. There's no people on Mars
[15683.87s -> 15686.87s]  There's no aliens on Mars, you know, how many planets exist it
[15686.87s -> 15695.34s]  It's probably crazy that we exist in the first place the fur the top when an alien lands on this planet and they go Roger that
[15695.34s -> 15700.30s]  Yeah, this is not another planet, but just like red gas everywhere and a bunch of like red red. Everything's red
[15700.30s -> 15704.84s]  Oh, see this life there. Hi, mr. Alien. How are you?
[15707.64s -> 15709.64s]  The heads are gonna explode
[15710.28s -> 15714.19s]  Exactly what I told you was gonna happen. I'm telling you that's what's gonna happen
[15714.39s -> 15725.44s]  But with them that means they would have to be able to talk to no, but maybe they'd have like telepathy
[15725.64s -> 15728.68s]  What is it? What are you doing?
[15728.68s -> 15732.14s]  someone someone stop him
[15742.11s -> 15749.49s]  Why can I do this do you see this non-Newtonian fluid do you see what this is capable of I would they would get off the
[15749.49s -> 15756.00s]  Ship and I'd go. Oh, hold on. Mr. Alien. Oh, what's that device? He's putting in his mouth
[15764.75s -> 15767.80s]  We're gonna go
[15767.80s -> 15772.61s]  We're gonna go. We're gonna go. We're gonna go. We're gonna go eat it eat it
[15773.21s -> 15777.05s]  Well, they would think it was food. Well, did they even know what food is?
[15777.69s -> 15780.95s]  Huffing chapstick. Don't you get it?
[15780.95s -> 15782.95s]  Like they put it what if they don't even know what food is
[15783.23s -> 15788.42s]  The fact that they could just be this weird sentient thing of light that doesn't even know
[15789.40s -> 15795.20s]  Imagine if you the fact of the eat a cheeseburger in front of alien and then seven to twelve hours lady
[15795.20s -> 15798.64s]  You go into a room and that food comes out of your body
[15799.00s -> 15808.28s]  What a bizarre fucking planet we're on just the act of shitting could be so
[15808.80s -> 15809.94s]  world
[15809.94s -> 15812.06s]  changing and world ending
[15812.88s -> 15819.52s]  Pregnancy the fact that a person lives inside of somebody else's stomach. It's like no way, man
[15819.96s -> 15829.37s]  They would show up and they would leave we would scare the living hell out of everybody that came to this planet
[15829.37s -> 15851.16s]  L torches you would well, I'm not the ambassador of Earth. How do we even decide who that is?
[15851.72s -> 15855.96s]  I'm serious like it would have been macho man rainy savage
[15856.78s -> 15862.55s]  What the world is so fucked up with such a crazy world with all these magical powers like that would be the person they would
[15862.55s -> 15863.99s]  Probably expect
[15863.99s -> 15880.50s]  Just fire man fires just magical powers
[15881.26s -> 15892.37s]  We have furries. I don't but that's not a
[15895.02s -> 15897.02s]  So what do you mean by that?
[15897.46s -> 15908.74s]  Wait, you saying that are the ambassador of the planet should be like somebody in like a fursuit
[15910.31s -> 15912.31s]  Yes
[15914.11s -> 15922.08s]  That I'm into that I'm actually into that that would be fun
[15927.80s -> 15929.80s]  Mushrooms are weird
[15930.42s -> 15932.42s]  Classical music is weird. You have music
[15932.86s -> 15940.71s]  we have no idea we could be the ones that have all this art and entertainment and and
[15941.75s -> 15943.35s]  electricity and power
[15943.35s -> 15945.65s]  the sight of
[15945.65s -> 15947.13s]  running water
[15947.13s -> 15960.01s]  Could turn an alien inside out. And by the way, we've made up all these chemicals names
[15961.62s -> 15966.06s]  War would not start with the aliens over all power. It's about power
[15967.22s -> 15969.70s]  No, we call water water and that's not what it is
[15970.14s -> 15975.51s]  It's something else completely different and we've been completely wrong about it and they're like, it's actually not water
[15976.07s -> 15983.11s]  It's something else entirely you have the wrong chemical makeup. It's not okay. What's a chemical chemical chemical. What's that?
[15983.47s -> 15991.52s]  No, this is a bit we could be wrong about that and what if they tell us that somebody just fucking drops a nuke on planet fructose
[15992.04s -> 16015.29s]  This is the boss this dude is beyond zonk. Oh, we have a crazy world and
[16024.32s -> 16030.80s]  We make up all this stuff that we already do that the aliens are apparently gonna do better than us, right?
[16031.32s -> 16040.70s]  And we have virtual reality. So, I mean the aliens probably have like a real holographic virtual reality world
[16041.78s -> 16045.62s]  We're projecting what we think we're gonna be able to do in the future and that's just gonna be us
[16046.22s -> 16054.30s]  We're gonna scare the living shit and anybody that comes over here
[16054.86s -> 16070.34s]  even alien dark souls
[16070.34s -> 16076.70s]  You would have to explain to the alien the concept of controlling something that isn't alive
[16077.50s -> 16079.90s]  With your hands and your mind
[16082.59s -> 16083.71s]  Huh?
[16083.71s -> 16088.21s]  Well, you see here. Mr. Alien the thing on the screen right now is not alive
[16088.21s -> 16094.77s]  I'm controlling it with my brain and using my brain to put inputs into a device which controls the non-living being on the camera
[16094.97s -> 16101.48s]  On the screen right now. Don't worry when you see it get its head exploded by the sledgehammer. It's not real
[16102.04s -> 16105.99s]  It's just I'm making that happen because I feel like it has that fun
[16106.55s -> 16112.75s]  Hey, so where's your teleportation device? That's what we're really looking for. Mr. Alien. Hey, you guys can teleport, right?
[16112.75s -> 16116.91s]  Are you gonna teach us?
[16132.47s -> 16134.67s]  So offensive to an alien viewer
[16139.54s -> 16141.54s]  Explain horror movies to an alien
[16147.96s -> 16151.76s]  So what's happening right now, you know, we're watching somebody get killed
[16152.04s -> 16157.32s]  He just put a knife on that hurt the knife is though as a weapon in your people's culture that hurts
[16157.88s -> 16159.28s]  Yes, it is
[16159.28s -> 16166.16s]  That that man just put that thing that hurts people on their neck and slash their neck and their life fluid came out
[16166.48s -> 16172.36s]  No, no, no alien this stupid alien. Are you dumb? We just pretend to kill each other
[16173.16s -> 16181.08s]  Gruesomely horrifically and scarily it's for fun war and death is not fun, huh?
[16181.36s -> 16184.36s]  Why are you doing this human? Oh what you see
[16184.88s -> 16187.52s]  We all get together and you're gonna love it
[16187.52s -> 16192.78s]  We all get together and we sit in a big room with potential hundreds of us
[16192.78s -> 16198.10s]  We go into a big room and we eat get a bunch of snacks and we watch that exact person
[16198.58s -> 16204.58s]  Slash the throats of tons of innocent scared people when we all clap in and it's a really great time
[16204.58s -> 16205.38s]  And it's real though
[16205.38s -> 16210.98s]  And by the way, it's being projected into your brain through your eyeballs and it's a fake thing on screen
[16210.98s -> 16221.96s]  Let's be the game explaining a horror movie. Why do they do this? What's wrong with them?
[16222.48s -> 16228.86s]  We must do a re origination of the plow. That's right. Sorry. You have no technology
[16229.14s -> 16232.38s]  We're projecting that image of an alien. That's gonna wipe us out
[16233.06s -> 16238.95s]  We're the scary ones. We must do every origination of the plan. That's gonna be us
[16239.51s -> 16245.78s]  We're not gonna be happy with like the like a season of like some alien TV show
[16245.78s -> 16272.94s]  We're just gonna get rid of it magic being a new viewer. Are you done?
[16275.42s -> 16284.90s]  Yeah, this guy's an alien
[16289.30s -> 16300.02s]  No, I'm not going off again. I don't need to explain what a dinosaur is to an alien again
[16300.02s -> 16302.02s]  No, cuz we don't even know what a dinosaur looks like
[16302.42s -> 16311.27s]  We pretend to know what a dinosaur looks like reserved bones. It's Steven Spielberg. I had a t-rex go
[16313.53s -> 16319.26s]  And we all go yeah, yeah, that's right. That's exactly what happens. All right, I'm done. I'm done. Get me out of this
[16319.42s -> 16326.62s]  Get me out of this moving on. I'm gonna continue my playthrough of
[16327.38s -> 16340.10s]  Whatever this thrills real seeker. I'm a little hungry. Let's do ice cream and pizza. It's a good combo
[16342.33s -> 16354.87s]  Relax some ice cream
[16355.88s -> 16366.42s]  Everybody loves ice cream. How did frozen fruit get to that? I'm so sorry everyone
[16366.90s -> 16373.02s]  You're trying to explain language so much but not writing
[16373.62s -> 16382.39s]  Guys, we're gonna meet aliens one day and it's gonna be such a disappointment
[16383.03s -> 16388.08s]  there's gonna be a puddle on the ground with a face that just goes like
[16390.76s -> 16392.78s]  Yeah
[16392.78s -> 16399.74s]  And that's gonna be the extent of our alien contact. This is gonna be so disappointing
[16399.74s -> 16409.26s]  Oh, where's the time travel? Where's the holograms? No, this is a puddle that has a face
[16409.78s -> 16428.57s]  It like burps every four to five minutes. I want to build something else. Oh wait
[16428.57s -> 16437.39s]  I want to play this the aliens probably just gonna be a bat of bacteria
[16437.91s -> 16443.10s]  Yeah, it's gonna be small bugs
[16444.70s -> 16464.39s]  All right. I told you get me off this not give me on again. I'm doing with a controller by the way. Oh
[16476.78s -> 16508.03s]  Alright, that's cool. What's this do you welding? Oh, what is this?
[16510.08s -> 16513.47s]  What's going on the vacuum?
[16514.23s -> 16546.45s]  Okay, again, it points my need by the way, if I'm wrong about all the alien stuff
[16546.45s -> 16567.64s]  They take it be hostage first. I mean like oh you talked all this shit. Yeah, I'm gonna be the first like
[16568.38s -> 16588.06s]  execution from the aliens
[16588.06s -> 16590.06s]  explain porn to an alien
[16594.88s -> 16608.52s]  I think that's so hard. Oh, you see mr. Alien
[16608.68s -> 16614.95s]  We've got these two people and they they have an intercourse with each other on
[16615.67s -> 16621.91s]  This device that you've been shown before and it's it's and it means to excite the watcher. Oh
[16622.95s -> 16625.71s]  Okay, that makes perfect sense to me. I guess oh
[16626.75s -> 16628.15s]  good
[16628.15s -> 16630.46s]  That's not all you see
[16631.18s -> 16636.94s]  Also, there's a ton of other things that people find to be in that same realm of
[16638.58s -> 16640.58s]  Like a procreatable intimacy
[16641.98s -> 16644.70s]  It's not just that there's a lot of stuff
[16645.34s -> 16647.34s]  What could you possibly be?
[16647.78s -> 16649.78s]  procreation is procreation
[16651.30s -> 16657.96s]  You not entirely, you know, I'm sorry mr. Alien see some people
[16658.96s -> 16664.24s]  I
[16664.24s -> 16672.80s]  Am done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I don't understand you but what's the point of 30 people being in this room?
[16673.28s -> 16675.45s]  well, I mean, I
[16676.09s -> 16693.60s]  Feel like we would be
[16693.60s -> 16695.48s]  held at arm's length
[16695.48s -> 16700.02s]  Ultimately, I think we would probably be
[16700.82s -> 16701.86s]  diplomatically
[16701.86s -> 16709.76s]  We would get like texted every now and then just to see how we're doing and I don't have to come over
[16709.76s -> 16713.86s]  I just want to know how things are things are going. Well good
[16714.42s -> 16729.43s]  Please leave us alone. Oh god. I don't want to do this cat. This man is almost 40 by the way
[16729.43s -> 16733.71s]  I mean not almost
[16734.39s -> 16752.41s]  Flows but not really it's plain toothpaste aliens. I want to ride this thing. You see how cool this thing is
[16752.99s -> 16769.16s]  I'm not 40. I want to ride this was that
[16769.76s -> 16772.81s]  Auntie thrillville ad oh shit
[16773.33s -> 16785.83s]  Try the go-karts. I want to ride the this monster truck thing. It looks crazy. I thought that was a nose
[16787.16s -> 16797.01s]  Pizza slice. I was like, what is the giant nose stall? What is that? How do I ride this? I want to ride that
[16797.01s -> 16816.47s]  I will put this one here big enough space for it, right? Yeah, it's cuz it's not a ride
[16817.03s -> 16819.84s]  But there sure is a lot of people dying on it
[16819.88s -> 16835.15s]  What how is that on a ride? I have to leave this stream is too much. All right. Well, just know that
[16835.43s -> 16839.23s]  Oh wait, this is Sammy from the original first five minutes of the game
[16839.79s -> 16842.78s]  Are you it was weird?
[16843.26s -> 16850.04s]  Like small like eight-year-olds don't do they don't shake hands. It was weird. They don't shake hands
[16850.44s -> 16861.37s]  He still hasn't gone to the bathroom

[16896.02s -> 16898.64s]  What's your worst moment
[16899.40s -> 16901.40s]  You sure it's not not being able to go to the bathroom
[16901.96s -> 16909.39s]  What's your favorite hobby I've done it for years it was the best steak
[16911.39s -> 16918.19s]  Little kids eat steak. I love my dad. I don't remember eating steaks when I was like seven or eight
[16919.19s -> 16938.45s]  Steak I don't I didn't eat steak. It's love steak. I don't remember eating a steak
[16940.21s -> 16943.55s]  I didn't eat steak till I was like, yeah, at least like probably 14 15 or 16
[16944.19s -> 16947.91s]  Maybe that now probably like for 13 or 14 not this young
[16968.42s -> 16970.42s]  Well, that's the best game you're right
[16970.46s -> 16979.14s]  Alright, get out of here. He's why is this sad? I got 16 gram. We're gonna make an insane roller coaster
[16979.40s -> 16998.04s]  Is there another slot for a roller coaster? I don't think there's an oh, yeah, there is okay. Let's make a coaster here
[16998.40s -> 17006.82s]  All right, this one's gonna be nuts wagon trail
[17007.78s -> 17010.06s]  Pendulizer log. All right. How about the pendulizer?
[17026.19s -> 17029.74s]  But like what I got for whoa nothing so far
[17047.20s -> 17052.42s]  What's the maximum way to like liquefy somebody's insides right it's like to do this and then this immediately, right
[17067.52s -> 17073.72s]  Oh, that's yeah, that's pretty cool and your Lizer

[17103.51s -> 17105.51s]  Liquify their spines
[17106.35s -> 17114.27s]  Man you're just pressing buttons. I'm so bad at this kind of stuff. I know that there's a ton of you guys watching
[17114.75s -> 17120.50s]  That you likely spend a lot of time meticulously making a track and everything. I just
[17121.18s -> 17127.31s]  Not enough power. I need more power. Oh
[17131.59s -> 17149.94s]  All right, let's try it everyone, how can you not get a full solution from them we're talking about
[17160.31s -> 17167.66s]  Why I
[17167.70s -> 17171.41s]  Can't go this far. I don't have power
[17173.19s -> 17175.10s]  I
[17175.10s -> 17188.90s]  Added more electricity. I guess I can't build a roller coaster
[17190.94s -> 17193.82s]  Unless I end it here
[17212.95s -> 17246.55s]  This coaster sucks just build in another park. I want I had a lot of money here. Yeah
[17247.07s -> 17273.97s]  Alright, you're really excited to ride this one on and tell me how you like it. Where is she?

[17332.49s -> 17334.49s]  I
[17334.61s -> 17336.61s]  Can't believe how rude you are
[17337.68s -> 17339.68s]  Anybody gives a shit about your opinion about my park
[17340.20s -> 17345.12s]  See how many people are here. You see how many customers are here right now. Go look on Yelp
[17345.12s -> 17350.88s]  I got a 3.4 right now. I got a 3.4 on Yelp you what you're gonna say is meaningless
[17351.44s -> 17354.88s]  It's a fair price
[17354.88s -> 17358.14s]  Fair price lots of attractions
[17358.74s -> 17360.96s]  Nobody cares what you have to say
[17360.96s -> 17364.82s]  That's Sammy

[17897.72s -> 17903.57s]  I don't actually want to I want to play on my broken course where I can cheat. I don't want to do this
[17906.70s -> 17912.94s]  Actually have to play nine holes against this kid. I want to play him against the one where I can beat him in one hit
[17913.30s -> 17927.99s]  All right, this is it really actually pretty important. He's pretty good. He got that hole in one. So did I all right par three
[17928.47s -> 17943.62s]  Let's go right there. I think you make up I can make ground up here. Just don't screw this up. Oh
[17947.74s -> 17949.94s]  How much softer was I?
[17950.78s -> 17952.46s]  Supposed to do that
[17952.46s -> 17973.12s]  Alright, he got four here. I'm gonna use that old strategy. You might as well just leave now kid. Good luck. It's over
[17973.56s -> 17983.17s]  What I get two for that one got to hit this one a little bit harder
[17983.53s -> 17992.43s]  This does have to go uphill. It's back-to-back only one and I make it three in a row
[17992.43s -> 18004.56s]  Let's make it a hat trick. He went over. Oh, you know, you went under that's fine. We get a good look. I hugged this wall. Oh
[18012.16s -> 18015.35s]  Yuck
[18015.35s -> 18033.17s]  Nobody knows how to do these doesn't matter. I made up a lot of ground good. All right it
[18033.81s -> 18045.18s]  He could still come back. This is par four. I wonder if I just avoid. Yeah
[18045.44s -> 18047.44s]  I'm thinking just avoid the middle
[18047.56s -> 18050.93s]  Or just to hit it hard enough. I'm gonna try to hit it hard enough. Let's see
[18051.57s -> 18069.04s]  Perfect. Perfect. All right. He got
[18069.60s -> 18084.49s]  He went under on this one. It's a little weird up there
[18084.81s -> 18106.93s]  Not bad sink it very hard for me to lose this now. I'm thinking full power right here or at least like 80% power
[18110.41s -> 18112.41s]  Oh
[18113.37s -> 18165.02s]  Almost get silly with this one. All right. Okay. All right, don't screw this up. I won
[18165.02s -> 18173.46s]  I was pretty good and I kind of blew it at the end there, but I think that was fine was
[18180.93s -> 18191.17s]  We're literally best friends so now what can I what's the point of this what can I do? Oh, no, it doesn't
[18192.58s -> 18196.50s]  Lightning strikes the earth 17 million times a day. That's a lie
[18203.83s -> 18213.07s]  200 times a second lightning is striking the earth. Wow, how
[18222.83s -> 18238.91s]  All right, good conversation. Goodbye earth is big. Yeah, but 200 times a second though. That's a lot
[18238.91s -> 18256.80s]  I got 20 grand. Let me go to the other section over here
[18257.32s -> 18267.04s]  Let's go to Saddleville. Oh, that's right. The ocean. I don't know why I keep thinking like
[18267.64s -> 18273.64s]  New York City getting hit by lightning 200 times a second or like LA. Oh, yeah, this is just 200
[18273.68s -> 18275.68s]  It's literally that these oceans
[18280.12s -> 18283.80s]  Forgot about the ocean 200 times a second
[18293.92s -> 18301.99s]  It's a bad ending
[18302.03s -> 18311.30s]  Okay, the ocean sucks. Anyways
[18311.90s -> 18314.92s]  Why you say that?
[18314.92s -> 18322.00s]  That's kind of a weird opinion. The ocean sucks. Like fuck the ocean. Why that's a weird opinion
[18322.24s -> 18327.47s]  Why you hate the ocean? The ocean is actually kind of
[18328.11s -> 18333.87s]  Unbelievable
[18334.39s -> 18352.55s]  Imagine explaining an ocean to an alien. Oh, I played that already. Is there even room for more rides here? I don't think there is
[18357.92s -> 18369.24s]  All right
[18369.24s -> 18401.96s]  Battleville, I don't have a battleville. Whoa. It's that ride. Who is this?
[18402.32s -> 18437.02s]  I love money. There are just tanks running over stuff. All right, I'm gonna build something over here coffee and

[18467.71s -> 18489.04s]  I can I can go against the critic. Okay, I don't want this to be too boring, but I don't want to be too
[18520.68s -> 18522.68s]  Well, there's planes of fire
[18525.80s -> 18550.23s]  Like my pretend enthusiasm what is it okay to sell the following rides that are in the way what ride whoops
[18550.23s -> 18552.23s]  Well, I sold that ride that was in the way
[18557.01s -> 18560.92s]  Alright, I just want to beat that guy
[18561.48s -> 18580.16s]  What?
[18580.32s -> 18597.65s]  Just finish the track
[18612.79s -> 18622.30s]  I blocked it did I though hold on
[18627.42s -> 18629.42s]  I
[18639.31s -> 18644.11s]  Go down
[18644.31s -> 18646.31s]  Oh
[18661.20s -> 18665.73s]  Boy that's a big one. All right. I gotta practice first
[18669.20s -> 18678.28s]  Break is X accelerate is a power slide is right trigger. Okay, let's do it. He's practicing too. I
[18680.06s -> 18686.65s]  Was just trying to kill everybody. All right, let's go
[18696.67s -> 18720.46s]  No
[18720.46s -> 18737.39s]  No, how many laps three? Thank God there are bumpers. Yeah, I would have fell off five minutes ago
[18737.91s -> 18750.56s]  The track minimap on the left looks like you got shitfaced and tried to make a pretzel. It's a great drunk idea
[18750.56s -> 18770.20s]  let's make pretzels tonight or
[18770.76s -> 18772.87s]  the
[18772.91s -> 18776.63s]  You know like when they have the skeleton in the classroom and it has the organs
[18777.19s -> 18782.69s]  It's just the intestines that weird that kind of cut in half person
[18783.21s -> 18812.02s]  Alright now I got a challenge that guy. All right, leave in the dust five stars. Hell. Yeah. All right, where is he?
[18812.18s -> 18822.56s]  Hey mo pots. Hey you piece of shit
[18828.48s -> 18830.48s]  You're about to lose to a child
[18838.48s -> 18841.98s]  Oh really
[18844.80s -> 18846.24s]  You like a drum
[18846.24s -> 18855.36s]  Okay, it's time. I'm gonna get a prediction gone. Will I beat this guy?
[18855.36s -> 18871.81s]  I think I will yo the map track looks like Squidward. I have to see it. I don't know. How's it?
[18872.21s -> 18885.21s]  mo Biden
[18885.21s -> 18892.64s]  What's good for acid reflux?
[18894.20s -> 18896.20s]  Don't eat before bed
[18896.52s -> 18899.84s]  If you're gonna eat make sure you have like at least an hour or two to digest before you let on
[18904.33s -> 18914.66s]  Don't eat anything too crazy before it's usually a lot before bed void stuff that really kind of makes it
[18914.70s -> 18922.56s]  I mean, I was told one time and I made like a little joke to the doctor and he like didn't think it was funny
[18922.56s -> 18928.93s]  He just kind of moved on I probably was like the 30th person that day that made the joke when I was first talking about
[18928.93s -> 18933.09s]  Oh, man, I've got acid. What should I do to stop the acid, right? I've got put on
[18935.36s -> 18943.09s]  A day anti acid protein pump inhibitor right before and he gave me a list of all the things that you should avoid
[18943.57s -> 18948.29s]  Completely if you're trying to reduce acid and see how it goes it was coffee
[18949.21s -> 18955.52s]  Alcohol spicy food chocolate. It was a list of just all this stuff and I looked at him and I was like
[18955.52s -> 18957.74s]  Oh, man, all the good stuff, huh?
[18957.74s -> 18962.66s]  You got can't eat all the good stuff and he did he with a straight face. He just walked out of the room
[18962.66s -> 18973.00s]  He didn't even listen. It was like he did not even care that I spoke. It was like garlic onions coffee alcohol
[18973.72s -> 18981.01s]  Cheese literally everything that you like on earth. He walked out of the room. It was as if I didn't say it
[18981.01s -> 18987.97s]  He probably hears that every day. Here we go
[18994.49s -> 19005.10s]  Hey y'all fuck now. Neither one of us can win. You're trapped here forever. You're my prisoner
[19005.48s -> 19023.29s]  What if he goes but above beyond the finish line?
[19032.07s -> 19057.21s]  Hi motherfucker, it's not Squidward. What are you talking about?
[19057.81s -> 19065.18s]  Doesn't look like anything at all like Squidward
[19065.42s -> 19071.13s]  This guy's bad too, by the way, the the guy that I was racing in the generic race was better than the guy
[19071.13s -> 19081.39s]  That's the best racer in the game. Let's see if I can lap him
[19081.39s -> 19085.90s]  I'm gonna tow this motherfucker never in the beginning the stream. I talked about lapping toad. Oh
[19106.01s -> 19128.84s]  Shit, I'm gonna try to turn him the other way. I want to spin him backwards
[19128.84s -> 19151.61s]  Oh, I can't accelerate up the hill. Where is he? Wait, where'd he go? Where is he? Oh shit. He's always screwed
[19151.61s -> 19206.96s]  I'm trying to get him stuck so I can lap him. I've won. Oh, I beat him. Oh, okay. Okay. All right
[19208.16s -> 19213.52s]  Now get out of here scram
[19215.59s -> 19217.83s]  I don't get at least a 3.5 on Yelp
[19217.83s -> 19224.56s]  I'm taking the VIP back and I want my bear back and I want that rubber chicken
[19224.56s -> 19236.65s]  I gave you to a lot of people in the park though. I'm getting hungry
[19236.65s -> 19252.87s]  I want to eat times that's been five and a half hours. I don't feel like it's been like three now
[19252.87s -> 19254.87s]  The real question is what are we gonna play this weekend?
[19254.91s -> 19263.22s]  It's completely up in the air because after this weekend stream whether it's probably Saturday or Sunday
[19263.86s -> 19270.29s]  It's Saturday after this weekend stream every Sunday every Saturday
[19270.29s -> 19278.98s]  I'm doing about like a week or two of VR straight. I'm setting that room up again. We're gonna go for it again
[19279.26s -> 19292.06s]  Hey, I want to see how this one works. No, I hate these why would I I don't understand why people ride these
[19292.44s -> 19300.01s]  You know, don't even explain this to aliens explain this to me why people get on this because I don't get it
[19300.27s -> 19305.07s]  This makes you feel awful
[19305.11s -> 19319.24s]  That's wrong. What needs repair
[19319.72s -> 19339.56s]  Ten million versus one. Wow. Yeah, I don't I don't get it not into it at all
[19339.84s -> 19341.93s]  It makes you feel awful
[19341.93s -> 19346.68s]  Even if it doesn't make you feel like sick or anything. It makes you feel bad
[19347.28s -> 19363.95s]  Do a coaster. All right, what about some of the pre-built ones? I'm very curious about these
[19364.51s -> 19378.46s]  Ye olde wagon. I'm looking one of some of the pre-builds. I'll build my own
[19389.88s -> 19391.88s]  You
[19393.08s -> 19396.91s]  All right, let's go oh I just got this compact coaster
[19398.73s -> 19400.01s]  minimum power
[19400.01s -> 19411.06s]  What area power limit? Oh, I can't just play inscription
[19411.06s -> 19423.64s]  I keep people keep saying to play that but I don't know a more ever hood
[19424.00s -> 19434.51s]  That's not a bad idea either. You're too dumb for inscription. That's what I'm afraid of. I'll be honest
[19434.95s -> 19441.22s]  You gotta do monster rancher. That's right. We'll figure it out
[19441.78s -> 19451.25s]  That all right, I'm gonna play one more game and then I'm gonna get some food. We'll end it in like another 20 minutes
[19451.25s -> 19468.57s]  So what turbo Ville? She's putting in double time there like NBA 2k
[19469.21s -> 19480.83s]  Alright, do you guys think if I played NBA 2k 20? This is not gonna happen. Just I want to be I gotta get this out there
[19481.31s -> 19484.34s]  Would more than 5,000 people be at that stream?
[19484.70s -> 19495.48s]  Would that stream get more than three or four thousand viewers if I played NBA 2k 22?
[19499.19s -> 19505.49s]  What's wrong things broken sell it what I sell the guy
[19506.01s -> 19518.66s]  This thing too. Yeah, this thing was always at the fair. Oh
[19528.44s -> 19545.25s]  I can't even look at it anymore. I don't even look at it. Yeah, I don't think that more than 5,000 people are on that stream
[19545.77s -> 19554.30s]  All right. What's the last thing I'm gonna do? I need one more thing to do
[19554.98s -> 19565.78s]  Viewers choice, what should I do one more game? I'm pretty sure there are 15,000 people that don't give a shit about this game
[19566.18s -> 19575.18s]  Yeah, but there's a difference between a game there's a playing NBA 2k and just playing NBA. I
[19575.62s -> 19577.18s]  Think there's a difference
[19577.18s -> 19583.74s]  None of you guys would want to watch me play Madden either
[19584.30s -> 19598.50s]  All right one guy in the chat want to be placed on writer really bad again
[19598.50s -> 19600.50s]  So I'll do it. I'll do it for the guy in the chat
[19600.62s -> 19610.54s]  Play Dota. I don't know what's worse
[19611.18s -> 19617.09s]  playing Dota for five hours on
[19617.65s -> 19619.65s]  stream or playing
[19620.09s -> 19626.81s]  Like Madden NFL 2k 19. I'm not sure what you guys what you guys would like less
[19627.57s -> 19640.66s]  2k would be way worse. I don't know. I feel like I could it
[19641.02s -> 19644.46s]  It might be fun just to even play maddening like lose by a hundred points
[19644.98s -> 19648.52s]  but playing like poorly in Dota or League would just be
[19649.18s -> 19654.46s]  Kind of embarrassing and there's no fun funny any it's just like wow this guy just sucks at League
[19655.82s -> 19660.46s]  Like if I if I run the ball back for a touchdown, that's that's excitement if I run into the tower
[19660.46s -> 19671.11s]  I'm an asshole and nobody likes me. I was doing all right right there
[19671.57s -> 19685.11s]  Bobas are really boring to watch the only mobile
[19685.11s -> 19690.65s]  I've ever really played with smite and if I even understand that people don't really want to watch that
[19692.13s -> 19694.18s]  unless
[19694.18s -> 19699.58s]  Unless that you're good enough because those games are really competitive and if I was
[19700.30s -> 19703.26s]  Unbelievable at Dota or something right laughs. I was like
[19703.90s -> 19707.06s]  Super rank or whatever they whatever it is. I mean yeah
[19707.06s -> 19712.06s]  I mean you're what if you're if you're not super diamond rank, and I am diamond rank then it's like okay
[19712.62s -> 19719.69s]  But if I have no idea what I'm doing. I don't know what the characters names are I feel like people would just be like
[19720.33s -> 19729.52s]  Jeremy what are you doing? I don't know what items I'm buying
[19730.16s -> 19736.52s]  Okay, that could be fun a little while, but not for more than a couple of streams. I don't know I don't think
[19737.12s -> 19744.86s]  late Tekken 7 oh
[19745.46s -> 19754.34s]  You mean this cuz that's all you that that would be
[19754.94s -> 19757.54s]  It's a real song
[19757.54s -> 19762.06s]  Here we go here. We go here. We go now now
[19762.62s -> 19764.62s]  Here we go, right?
[19789.06s -> 19798.23s]  You hit next track. Oh, I'd love to I don't care about DMC. I turn this up
[19798.23s -> 19842.92s]  Oh boy what what what was that I want to hear that I wish I kind of interested
[19844.96s -> 19854.93s]  What was that I'm so confused is that like a remix or like a
[19863.93s -> 19868.79s]  Like three songs
[19870.55s -> 19880.05s]  What is this and why is this in this game
[19888.29s -> 19898.65s]  Very interesting soundtrack is this one
[19912.10s -> 19914.10s]  P h r i
[19914.22s -> 19918.51s]  b i l l e
[19918.95s -> 19920.87s]  What are they spelling? Oh?
[19920.87s -> 19922.71s]  Yes, all right this one safe
[19922.71s -> 19927.38s]  No, I want that song
[19945.56s -> 19947.56s]  It's from Red Dead
[19948.92s -> 19950.92s]  But he can't apprehend
[19951.64s -> 19960.30s]  When the other kids are lost
[19961.61s -> 19963.61s]  Space plastic rocket ships
[19964.01s -> 19970.33s]  Chips well he's meeting bad guys face to face with a big iron on his head. Yep
[19971.37s -> 19987.18s]  There's a word he's heard but it don't place when the ghost does it it goes like
[19991.91s -> 19994.52s]  Where is it?
[19994.52s -> 19997.75s]  No

[20041.51s -> 20050.41s]  Oh is this one's he was a little no we they have like 10 songs in the whole soundtrack
