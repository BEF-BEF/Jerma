[0.31s -> 12.62s]  I'm gonna shoot you. I'm gonna shoot you in the back of the head.
[12.62s -> 18.79s]  You talking to me? Why did you turn around and start shooting me? I was like, just kidding.
[18.79s -> 23.42s]  I shot one time, it was a warning shot. Yeah, but your gun was like pointed at my face.
[23.42s -> 27.42s]  Yeah, and warning. Alright. Alright, wait. Let's go pick up Boo. Let's go ba-
[27.42s -> 31.42s]  What just happened? Oh, that's how you detonate C4.
[31.66s -> 38.78s]  Oh my god, are you serious, dude?
[38.78s -> 45.34s]  I did like a cartwheel. Oh, I hit the cop car.
[45.34s -> 49.34s]  Hey, hey, let's do it. Get in the car. Alright.
[49.34s -> 53.34s]  Setting the perfect trap for these two. Oh my god, this is a two-wheel, a two-passenger seat.
[53.34s -> 57.34s]  This is a two-person car, are you serious? Oh, Boo, sorry.
[57.34s -> 62.86s]  This is what you get.
[62.86s -> 66.86s]  Oh, you threw that over there, okay. Oh my god.
[66.86s -> 71.35s]  You deserve that stealth. Yeah. Stealth? What do I know?
[71.35s -> 75.35s]  Following over this to this cab car, let's do this. I forget what button you press.
[75.35s -> 79.91s]  I don't know how to get up. Oh god, it's-
[79.91s -> 83.91s]  It's left shift, it's left shift, okay. What the hell just happened?
[83.91s -> 94.74s]  I just scraped the building.
[94.74s -> 99.05s]  I just did a two- Oh no, I'm falling.
[99.05s -> 103.05s]  Dude, I just scraped the building. That was ridiculous.
[103.05s -> 107.53s]  Oh my god. There's a helicopter after me, you know.
[107.53s -> 111.77s]  If you look very far down. Actually, no, it's that one that's like half blown if you look down there.
[111.77s -> 116.14s]  Hey, stop it. Alright, ready, we're gonna come over here.
[116.14s -> 120.89s]  We're jumping off this side and we're all gonna- it's left shift to open the parachute.
[120.89s -> 126.33s]  You ready, guys? Let's do it. Oh baby.
[126.33s -> 131.70s]  Oh yeah. We're the three parachuting friends.
[131.70s -> 137.14s]  Oh, you can detach it with F. Oh shit.
[137.14s -> 141.77s]  Dude, I'm just still floating around. You hold down S to like not die.
[141.77s -> 147.19s]  S? And then you- like W-A-S-D?
[147.19s -> 152.31s]  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, guys, I forgot how to use my parachute.
[152.31s -> 157.70s]  I forgot how to use my parachute! What? How did you kill me?
[157.70s -> 162.38s]  I have nowhere near you.
[162.38s -> 167.26s]  Oh dear. Oh, you busted like a cap in me apparently.
[167.26s -> 171.26s]  You guys keep killing each other.
[171.26s -> 175.26s]  I plowed him.
[175.26s -> 180.95s]  Well, it worked as a new chopper. Dude, I feel like the Human Torch or something, like really like-
[180.95s -> 187.05s]  I really felt like the Human Torch right there.
[187.05s -> 193.46s]  Oh gosh. Where are you? Oh hey, look who's like following me right now, shooting like missiles at me.
[193.46s -> 197.46s]  Have you just been my parachuting all this time? Are you hitting the-
[197.46s -> 203.99s]  Are you hitting me right now? I think so. Alright, there's the land.
[203.99s -> 209.62s]  How did I die? I'll take your car, buddy.
[209.62s -> 216.98s]  It's like an M249 sword. Alright, let's do it.
[216.98s -> 221.67s]  I have four stars, I'm afraid. You do? Oh, you're back there. Alright, I'm coming to you.
[221.67s -> 226.09s]  Oh, will you get away from me? Oh my god.
[226.09s -> 230.09s]  What? What is going on? All the cops that were coming after you are like-
[230.09s -> 234.09s]  Oh my god, get me away! It's like an enemy helicopter.
[234.09s -> 238.09s]  Oh my god, dude. Oh my god.
[238.09s -> 242.71s]  What? Are you serious?
[242.71s -> 246.71s]  Why are there so many? Why are there so-
[246.71s -> 252.79s]  Why are they killing you?
[252.79s -> 256.79s]  Every cop in the city just came after me, like they just were all pulling up at the same time.
[256.79s -> 260.79s]  Why are there so many?
[260.79s -> 265.16s]  Why are there so-
[265.16s -> 269.85s]  Why are they killing you?
[269.85s -> 274.02s]  We're going to the other side. We're going to go this way, it's a little bit more of a longer drive.
[274.02s -> 278.02s]  I'm going to go off the edge!
[278.02s -> 282.20s]  The cops are coming, wait there.
[282.20s -> 289.10s]  Oh shit.
[289.10s -> 294.62s]  What are you doing?
[294.62s -> 299.37s]  What are you doing? We're trying to do
[299.37s -> 305.96s]  insane stunts.
[305.96s -> 309.96s]  So I lost the helicopter.
[309.96s -> 314.26s]  There's another one here, it's okay. How are you doing?
[314.26s -> 319.14s]  I'm so tempted to shoot this guy. No, don't do it, don't do it.
[319.14s -> 323.64s]  We're going to see if we get the cops on us for doing this.
[323.64s -> 329.42s]  He's like- Not yet, not yet, hold on.
[329.42s -> 335.06s]  Oh jeez.
[335.06s -> 339.30s]  I can't believe we don't have any stars.
[339.30s -> 343.54s]  He doesn't even get to testify pointing my gun at him.
[343.54s -> 351.64s]  It's the worst cop ever.
[351.64s -> 355.64s]  You are legitimately pointing your gun at his face.
[355.64s -> 362.23s]  Sorry officer.
[362.23s -> 372.02s]  Sorry officer.
[372.02s -> 382.44s]  Sorry officer.
[382.44s -> 392.17s]  Sorry officer.
[392.17s -> 396.17s]  I'm just going to go off the ground before I shoot.
[396.17s -> 400.60s]  There we go.
[400.60s -> 406.06s]  I know he's still alive, what a beast.
[406.06s -> 410.06s]  I'm like holding it upside down like this.
[410.06s -> 414.06s]  Your back was breaking to do it.
[414.06s -> 419.26s]  I'm laughing at that.
[419.26s -> 423.26s]  No, don't go over the edge!
[423.26s -> 427.50s]  When you see us getting close, do it.
[427.50s -> 432.44s]  Do it.
[432.44s -> 437.06s]  That's why we have to turn friendly fire off, so it doesn't kill us.
[437.06s -> 443.03s]  Oh my god.
