[0.95s -> 11.67s]  Hey, how's it going? Turn up the volume. I have this at a reasonable decibel level, I believe.
[11.67s -> 21.86s]  How you guys doing? Just making a tweet. Sorry, I didn't start where I wanted to about 30-40
[21.86s -> 30.39s]  minutes ago. One of my webcams was blue-screening the computer. I have no idea why. I have two
[31.53s -> 38.42s]  webcams. Remember when I had the Labo stream from this past weekend? I mean, they were
[39.14s -> 43.70s]  all the things I read about saying that when you open up OBS and you have two webcams
[43.70s -> 48.18s]  enabled, it blue-screens, but I wasn't having that problem before. I don't know if there was
[48.18s -> 53.67s]  like a stealth update to the Logitech software. I have no idea, but apparently one of these was
[53.67s -> 58.07s]  just causing the driver to crash and blue-screening the whole computer. But hey,
[58.07s -> 64.04s]  I think I fixed it. We're good. Hasn't happened yet, so that's good. So let's see.
[64.04s -> 69.78s]  Seeing the sites in Hitman 2. Yeah, because that means I haven't seen it before.
[71.70s -> 77.13s]  It could be anything, you know, it could be whatever. Seeing the sites in Hitman 2.
[77.13s -> 87.11s]  That sounds pretty good to me. All right, so yeah, we got to the halfway point last night,
[88.52s -> 96.84s]  and I would assume, judging by we did three areas last night, I'm going to assume that we've
[96.84s -> 103.54s]  got three more here that will take us to the end. Now, that does not mean this is the end of
[103.54s -> 109.06s]  Hitman streams. This is talking about end of the campaign, technically, because there's a whole
[109.06s -> 114.82s]  lot of shit to do. And by the end of this stream, we will gauge whether or not I do it again.
[115.54s -> 120.66s]  And I will go back, we'll play some other contracts, we'll do some other campaign missions.
[121.70s -> 124.82s]  But for the purpose of the story, we're going to be done, I think, today.
[124.82s -> 132.06s]  So put some clothes on. I have clothes. Listen. No, I got to turn this off so you can hear
[132.06s -> 147.62s]  it. Ready? See? And then I got clothes on. Whoa, that was wicked loud! Why was it so loud?
[148.71s -> 154.07s]  And the canon vocal cords, just what was that? It was like, so here we are. Where
[154.07s -> 165.58s]  were we last time? I don't know why that was so loud. So we got Hitman 2. I don't know what
[165.58s -> 172.44s]  this is. So mission night call, we did it. Blank check. Cinematic. Let's go through our
[172.44s -> 180.42s]  Microsoft Windows tiles. Chasing a ghost and a ghost. And here we go. Mission Another Life.
[181.30s -> 187.21s]  This is where we left off. It's like, this is like spoilers. Why is it showing this to me?
[189.18s -> 195.75s]  Another life. But we're not gonna do it yet. And I know that the I know the audio is not on.
[197.10s -> 206.17s]  I'm well aware of it. Stop looking. But let's let people trickle in while I talk about
[206.97s -> 213.77s]  one other important thing. The green screen stream is slated and scheduled for tomorrow.
[214.66s -> 220.84s]  The thing is, though, I don't have a time yet. Because it's I'm kind of I'm working with a
[220.84s -> 227.66s]  studio. So I need to get like a time from them. I think it might just be kind of whenever
[227.66s -> 237.45s]  whenever I can start. So I don't necessarily have a direct exact time. But I will make
[237.45s -> 242.09s]  sure to tweet either later tonight or tomorrow afternoon the time that it's going to happen.
[243.18s -> 247.34s]  An estimate I would probably say around the normal start time what it's been for the last
[247.34s -> 253.18s]  couple of weeks. That's at least when I would like to do it. So it might be a little earlier
[253.18s -> 256.78s]  than that, considering I might I want to get in there early and get everything set up. So
[258.23s -> 264.87s]  the rough estimate is probably going to be between like four, like three and six
[265.35s -> 272.81s]  eastern time p.m. Maybe pull back a little bit earlier than that between like two and five maybe
[272.81s -> 278.04s]  eastern. I don't I just don't know. I don't have that time from the studio yet. So
[278.68s -> 284.04s]  I know that I am there for what's a call day. You can either do half days or full days in a
[284.04s -> 292.81s]  studio. And I believe I'm on a half day. So I think that means probably from like nine in
[292.81s -> 299.02s]  the morning to ten in the morning to like four in the afternoon Pacific. So I don't know.
[299.74s -> 305.59s]  I don't know. But let's go. I just want to give an update on that because
[305.59s -> 309.43s]  and if something if something crazy happens or if it changes I'll make sure to let you guys
[309.43s -> 315.27s]  know on Twitter. You know what? Just follow me on Twitter. Twitter.tv slash. I thought the
[315.27s -> 321.19s]  computer broke. The first constant is none other than Janus, the legendary Cold War spy
[321.19s -> 328.47s]  master, a KGB senior officer and head of the Sixth Column Special Branch at Lubyanka. Janus
[328.47s -> 335.19s]  is a certified genius and expert of counterintelligence. He retired from the KGB in 1988
[335.19s -> 339.75s]  when he fell out of favor with the Kremlin and affected to the U.S. Shortly after,
[339.75s -> 346.15s]  the Soviet Union collapsed. Now it is unclear when Janus stepped down as the constant. But
[346.79s -> 349.51s]  what's going on? Why is my computer like fucking up?
[351.75s -> 356.95s]  Right. So here's the catch. As an elite KGB agent, Janus was trained to withstand
[356.95s -> 361.75s]  interrogation and torture. No amount of pressure will force him to disclose information
[361.75s -> 368.31s]  he doesn't want to. Instead, we will need to search his home for clues. But if Providence
[368.31s -> 374.55s]  learns of our presence, the game is up. So we frame Janus, make Providence think
[374.55s -> 379.75s]  he was the real Shadow Client. Nice computer. Those is not Comcast. This is ComputerCast.
[380.55s -> 385.11s]  Claiming to have traced a number of calls from Janus's house to the Institute in Romania.
[385.11s -> 390.23s]  The case will seem clear. Mr. Gray was only a figurehead. Janus was pulling the strings
[390.23s -> 396.07s]  all along. And by eliminating him, we will have neutralized the militia once and for all.
[397.11s -> 403.03s]  However, for this subterfuge to work, you'll also need to deal with Janus's security detail.
[403.27s -> 409.03s]  Providence herald and former Secret Service agent by the name of Nolan Cassidy. Intel
[409.03s -> 414.95s]  describes him as diligent and inquisitive, and we cannot risk that he contradicts our story
[416.95s -> 423.19s]  Seems workable. I certainly hope so. Everything depends on this next move, 47. You made this
[423.19s -> 428.31s]  our fight. Now let's even the pain field. So they did a similar mission like this in
[428.39s -> 439.43s]  Hitman 2. What is going on with my frame rate? I am, I don't know. It's only like in that cut
[439.43s -> 446.41s]  scene. Is it Hitman 2 or is it Blood Money? Where you kind of have to go into the guy's
[446.41s -> 456.50s]  house. So I gotta get rid of these two. Let's take a look at our planning stage here. We
[456.50s -> 473.29s]  got Whittleton Creek. Oh, I got the silver baller this time. Master card. Mastercrafted.
[475.45s -> 488.31s]  Well, I mean, I just unlocked it, so I have to use it, right? Suburban suit. I mean, I, I guess
[488.31s -> 502.12s]  you're just wearing a suit. Should I need, why can I, I should be like a jogger. What is ice?
[502.12s -> 508.92s]  Oh, that's icy. Okay. Uh, I could do remotes, fragments, sub sedative, fills, coins.
[510.20s -> 514.52s]  No, give me the lockpick. I'll take the fish, but I'm taking the lockpick. I'm not doing
[514.52s -> 520.70s]  like the duck again. It didn't serve any purpose besides just throwing it into fucking random
[521.90s -> 529.70s]  objectives. All right, looks good. So got to get rid of Janice and get rid of Mr. Cassidy.
[530.26s -> 540.33s]  And now you got to find clues. I'm ready. Oh, so somebody, somebody, somebody who chatted,
[540.33s -> 543.53s]  but wait, Jeremy, what are you drinking tonight? What's that? Oh, I've both chatted
[543.53s -> 548.57s]  about random chatter. I'll tell you. So that it's a, um, I ran out of bananas
[549.45s -> 554.17s]  and I ran out of, of the things that I would put in here. Besides it's a, it's a, it's just
[554.17s -> 558.73s]  peanut butter and almond milk blended up hard. I'm just drinking peanut butter right now. It's
[558.73s -> 563.93s]  enough to like, it's a sustainable creek. Just like sustains me on the surface. A picture
[563.93s -> 571.29s]  perfect suburban dream, wide roads, golden maple trees and verdant lawns. Most residents
[571.29s -> 577.05s]  here are white collar professionals ranging from university staff to government employees.
[577.05s -> 584.65s]  So it runs fine now, but not all Janice's unpresuming home is protected by a host of
[584.65s -> 590.89s]  bodyguards and Intel shows that the fragile former constant rarely leaves the property.
[591.99s -> 596.87s]  Nolan Cassidy on the other hand, roams the neighborhood streets and he buys weed off the
[596.87s -> 602.63s]  local, the dutiful Providence paper route kids making threat assessments and settling in with
[602.63s -> 610.84s]  a security team. Now remember, this is about more than just revenge. Janice is the key to bring
[610.84s -> 618.84s]  down Providence. So get in there and find us a lead. Okay. Good luck. 47. So this just,
[618.84s -> 621.80s]  this is not just one house. This is just the whole neighborhood.
[623.48s -> 637.67s]  Okay. Let's see. You know, speaking of sustainability. Oh, this is not good. 47.
[637.67s -> 641.91s]  I've marked your map with several points of interest. We're running this mission with very
[641.91s -> 645.11s]  little upfront Intel. Alright, so I gotta be careful here. These locations could provide
[645.11s -> 651.83s]  clues to help you obtain the information we need. Good luck. Thanks. Alright, so let's see
[651.83s -> 658.55s]  what we got here. No entry. Don't tell me what to do. Oh, this is a yard sale. That's one
[658.55s -> 664.18s]  of those novelty signs you put in your college dorm room in front of the door. That's
[664.18s -> 675.62s]  cool. Uh, no, it's here. Wouldn't these things blow over? Yeah, they are blowing the leaves.
[675.62s -> 680.98s]  There he is. That is Nolan Cassidy, former Secret Service agent and current Providence
[680.98s -> 685.30s]  herald. Cassidy is assigned to protect Janice. Yeah. Well, he's not doing a very good job.
[685.30s -> 695.48s]  He's going to the college guy yard sale. Blend in as a garbage man. Where are they going?
[711.56s -> 716.52s]  Deal recording things from up there and then store in the tape somewhere else. I totally agree,
[716.52s -> 720.76s]  sir. Though separating the tapes from the playback device is necessary in case someone
[720.76s -> 725.80s]  gains access to the building. As you mentioned yourself, we can't let anyone know this is like
[725.80s -> 733.45s]  a bait. They're talking. I know what I said. Of course, I'm sorry. I'm just annoyed with
[733.45s -> 745.58s]  this setup. Understood, sir. Alright, interesting. So they're recording and the
[745.58s -> 749.86s]  tapes, the recording devices and the tapes are at different locations. Let me just keep looking
[749.86s -> 763.14s]  around. It's like a birthday party back here. Burlington Morgans. Are you allowed to go in
[763.14s -> 803.06s]  people's houses? Where's the mission? Am I allowed to be in here? I just opened up
[803.06s -> 815.37s]  somebody's house. I haven't seen you before. Who are you? Nobody. Is he like your boyfriend
[815.85s -> 821.91s]  or something? Oh, that's a party.
[824.63s -> 833.38s]  That's a party. Is this like your boyfriend or something?
[843.98s -> 849.94s]  He's not going to drink that, is he? Wait, you're not going to drink that, are you?
[850.50s -> 855.83s]  Oh, shit.
[871.34s -> 877.61s]  What? Back in the day, Janus was known for his obsessive need to archive
[877.61s -> 882.25s]  and keep memorabilia. If he has any microfilm in his house, it might contain something
[882.25s -> 900.15s]  interesting. Oh shit. Oh no, I can't. I can't do it. I can't. I'm not going to do it.
[900.95s -> 910.95s]  I can't. I can't do that. Oh, god damn it. All right.
[934.79s -> 947.00s]  All right, I'm ready. I was going to eat dinner. I'm sorry. I didn't want to do that.
[947.00s -> 949.64s]  We're running this mission with very little up front intel.
[949.64s -> 954.28s]  I just ran a simulation. I have to see every possibility. You know what I mean?
[955.32s -> 960.76s]  What's that movie where the guy could see every possibility? Dr. Strange. I need to see every
[960.76s -> 963.72s]  possibility to find out which one is the right one. You know what I mean? My head's going
[963.72s -> 967.16s]  all over the place. Look at my face. I'm making different facial expressions and shit.
[969.34s -> 970.54s]  I needed to see what was possible.
[970.54s -> 973.58s]  ...to help you obtain the information we need. Good luck.
[973.58s -> 983.30s]  Let's go over there. Yeah, that was not the correct timeline. But I saw the timeline. In
[983.30s -> 986.10s]  fact, we're going to go to the party because I feel like that's interesting to look at.
[990.52s -> 995.40s]  I did the Dr. Strange instead. No, see, right now I'm currently sitting on the rock.
[996.20s -> 1000.04s]  I'm sitting there as Dr. Strange. This is how long it took him, guys.
[1002.15s -> 1005.83s]  Like he had to see it all. He had to see every possibility and he just lived it.
[1005.83s -> 1007.75s]  That's what I'm doing right now until I find the right one.
[1010.68s -> 1018.71s]  That's not a spoiler. Dr. Strange like sits on a rock is not a spoiler.
[1032.39s -> 1033.19s]  Where does he sit?
[1045.46s -> 1046.50s]  Microfilm viewer.
[1047.06s -> 1048.74s]  That's an interesting...
[1048.74s -> 1050.34s]  Is this her party?
[1050.34s -> 1054.42s]  Well, it's sort of a hobby that never really took off. Besides,
[1054.42s -> 1057.43s]  I don't have any microfilm to play on the viewer.
[1057.43s -> 1059.03s]  Oh, I will. Very soon.
[1062.52s -> 1065.96s]  Janus next door collects all kinds of ancient memorabilia.
[1065.96s -> 1071.06s]  He might tape or where it is that sort of thing uses.
[1071.06s -> 1072.98s]  I'm sure he'd be delighted to lend you some.
[1072.98s -> 1075.62s]  The rock is in the New Avengers movie. Sure.
[1075.62s -> 1079.94s]  Janus was known for his obsessive need to archive and keep memorabilia.
[1079.94s -> 1083.78s]  If he has any microfilm in his house, it might contain something interesting.
[1083.78s -> 1088.39s]  Okay, so locate the microfilm is the next part.
[1090.63s -> 1093.91s]  Let's see. If Janus has any microfilm in his house,
[1093.91s -> 1095.67s]  it's bound to contain something interesting.
[1095.67s -> 1097.19s]  I'm assuming that's probably one of these.
[1098.15s -> 1102.23s]  An apple a day, breadcrumb trail, charbroiled, a house for sale,
[1102.23s -> 1104.87s]  no-spoking, pest control, and whack-a-mole.
[1105.59s -> 1110.95s]  It's not yet. Not yet.
[1114.82s -> 1116.74s]  Let's save it right here in case I drown somebody.
[1124.55s -> 1126.31s]  Sabotage. No, I need a screwdriver.
[1134.07s -> 1135.59s]  Just pretend to be the waiter.
[1135.59s -> 1136.31s]  Excuse me, sir.
[1139.26s -> 1141.11s]  Sir, would you like some cracked pepper?
[1142.07s -> 1142.95s]  Let me do that for you.
[1147.34s -> 1149.58s]  Smells like a gerbil crawled up your ass and died.
[1160.73s -> 1163.45s]  Kill that guy. That was just... come on, man.
[1169.80s -> 1170.52s]  No offense.
[1180.07s -> 1185.10s]  Hold on, wait a second. Can I push him into the grill?
[1191.62s -> 1194.02s]  I can't. I can't push him into the grill.
[1194.74s -> 1199.37s]  That's so unfortunate.
[1200.01s -> 1204.10s]  Oh, it's the propane tank not even on.
[1205.64s -> 1206.52s]  I need a propane tank.
[1207.16s -> 1213.46s]  Now let's keep looking around back here.
[1214.02s -> 1215.14s]  This is like a little party.
[1216.49s -> 1217.45s]  Fire extinguisher.
[1218.17s -> 1219.45s]  All right, let me install that for you.
[1222.38s -> 1223.58s]  Oh, this thing uses gas.
[1240.58s -> 1241.86s]  I can't pick this log.
[1241.86s -> 1242.58s]  I'm just gonna go around.
[1246.28s -> 1246.92s]  Somebody's right there.
[1246.92s -> 1247.72s]  All right, does this open?
[1248.84s -> 1251.32s]  Far less eyeballs over here.
[1252.04s -> 1252.92s]  I think I could get it.
[1252.92s -> 1253.56s]  Let's try it.
[1254.28s -> 1262.41s]  Okay, this is the Griswold property.
[1276.55s -> 1277.05s]  What?
[1277.05s -> 1281.15s]  No reason for him to kick the habit when he's already so close to kicking the...
[1281.15s -> 1285.23s]  So, Janeless Smudge, despite being dependent on an oxygen tank
[1285.23s -> 1288.03s]  and his bodyguard's insistence on hiding his cigarettes.
[1289.23s -> 1291.87s]  I wonder what might happen if he combined the two.
[1295.93s -> 1297.61s]  Obtain a pack of cigarettes.
[1297.61s -> 1300.25s]  Have you seen that oxygen tank near his bedroom window?
[1300.97s -> 1302.33s]  Near his bedroom window.
[1304.08s -> 1304.58s]  Okay.
[1304.74s -> 1307.46s]  So, uh...
[1309.42s -> 1311.82s]  I'm currently trespassing though, so I gotta get out of here.
[1314.38s -> 1315.98s]  Make him smoke waaaaah.
[1317.58s -> 1318.08s]  Kitty pull.
[1329.10s -> 1329.74s]  Can they see me?
[1331.22s -> 1331.78s]  Oh, they can.
[1331.78s -> 1332.34s]  All right, I'm gone.
[1332.34s -> 1332.84s]  I'm leaving.
[1333.46s -> 1334.74s]  I'm going, I'm going, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out.
[1335.54s -> 1341.07s]  This is a restricted area.
[1341.07s -> 1342.11s]  And you guys have guns?
[1345.76s -> 1346.72s]  I'm being shot at.
[1347.36s -> 1349.52s]  I just wanted to get my son's ball.
[1349.52s -> 1351.20s]  He threw it over the fence accidentally.
[1365.57s -> 1367.17s]  They're shooting at you with nail guns.
[1369.12s -> 1369.84s]  All right, I need to go.
[1369.84s -> 1372.32s]  Let's, let's, let's track the cigarette one.
[1372.32s -> 1377.07s]  Might as well.
[1377.07s -> 1377.79s]  We'll give it a try.
[1378.67s -> 1380.91s]  So, pack of cigarettes.
[1380.91s -> 1381.79s]  I gotta get over here.
[1382.59s -> 1388.30s]  I should be able to pop this lock without anyone shooting me.
[1389.10s -> 1390.80s]  I think, right?
[1390.80s -> 1393.76s]  They didn't see it last time, so why would they see it this time?
[1394.40s -> 1406.64s]  Okay, pack of story.
[1406.64s -> 1407.44s]  Pack of cigarettes.
[1408.16s -> 1409.16s]  There they are.
[1410.50s -> 1413.10s]  All right.
[1413.10s -> 1415.10s]  Infiltrate the Janus property now.
[1415.98s -> 1417.12s]  Which is right there.
[1418.00s -> 1420.75s]  He's using the waypoint.
[1420.75s -> 1423.94s]  So, I mean, I, whatever.
[1428.38s -> 1430.70s]  I just, I, why should I not be doing that?
[1431.58s -> 1438.77s]  I mean, I, I just like found it.
[1438.77s -> 1440.21s]  I didn't activate it at first.
[1444.43s -> 1448.13s]  I'm cheating.
[1448.13s -> 1448.63s]  Cheater.
[1449.33s -> 1450.99s]  Is this considered cheating?
[1456.30s -> 1458.42s]  I gotta get in through there.
[1458.42s -> 1459.94s]  But this place is heavily protected.
[1460.74s -> 1475.52s]  You get, you get a game refine.
[1476.72s -> 1479.97s]  Oh, how do I get through there?
[1480.77s -> 1482.77s]  Go get that man some gas.
[1485.41s -> 1485.91s]  What?
[1486.93s -> 1487.73s]  Place food.
[1487.73s -> 1488.29s]  What food?
[1493.25s -> 1493.75s]  What?
[1494.77s -> 1496.61s]  No, I, I just made it smaller.
[1501.10s -> 1503.02s]  I just made sushi in front of these people.
[1505.68s -> 1506.96s]  Gas, gas, gas.
[1506.96s -> 1507.68s]  Well, I need.
[1507.68s -> 1512.10s]  I just lost my fish.
[1512.10s -> 1513.30s]  I just turned it into sushi.
[1513.30s -> 1514.98s]  Why not just go inside?
[1514.98s -> 1516.26s]  It's open to everyone.
[1516.26s -> 1516.98s]  I know, I know the main story.
[1516.98s -> 1517.48s]  I know it.
[1518.66s -> 1519.62s]  Mission story revealed.
[1519.62s -> 1520.34s]  No, I don't.
[1520.34s -> 1520.84s]  I know.
[1521.78s -> 1522.50s]  I know.
[1522.50s -> 1526.34s]  It sounds like Nolan Cassidy has some interest in the party as well.
[1526.34s -> 1528.90s]  But for some reason, he's unwilling to go inside.
[1529.62s -> 1532.58s]  Maybe you can help fix whatever's wrong in there, 47.
[1533.70s -> 1535.97s]  Well, maybe he's a vegan.
[1536.77s -> 1539.50s]  I don't trust a man who can't eat a rare steak.
[1540.22s -> 1543.26s]  I don't trust a man who can't eat a rare steak.
[1544.46s -> 1544.96s]  Yeah.
[1546.62s -> 1546.94s]  Call it.
[1546.94s -> 1547.42s]  I want E.
[1547.42s -> 1547.92s]  Coli.
[1552.86s -> 1554.14s]  What the fuck did you say?
[1554.14s -> 1554.78s]  Don't let it slide.
[1554.78s -> 1555.34s]  Let it slide.
[1555.34s -> 1555.90s]  Let it slide.
[1555.90s -> 1556.46s]  Let it slide.
[1557.66s -> 1558.22s]  Let it slide.
[1572.48s -> 1573.12s]  All right.
[1573.12s -> 1575.12s]  The propane tank was just like over here.
[1576.00s -> 1578.46s]  I already opened this.
[1578.46s -> 1579.42s]  Where's the propane tank?
[1580.06s -> 1582.86s]  Probably by the grill, right?
[1584.30s -> 1584.80s]  Cheater.
[1585.58s -> 1597.33s]  Hey, it's in the game.
[1597.33s -> 1600.13s]  I'm going to utilize the waypoints if they show themselves.
[1600.13s -> 1602.93s]  Otherwise, look, I'm going to level with you guys here.
[1602.93s -> 1603.73s]  Like level with me.
[1604.75s -> 1606.75s]  You've seen the way that I've played the game so far.
[1607.55s -> 1609.87s]  If there was not a blip on the map somewhere,
[1610.67s -> 1614.43s]  eventually, I'm eventually telling me where I need to be,
[1614.43s -> 1616.88s]  I would just drown people in toilets.
[1617.52s -> 1618.00s]  You know what I mean?
[1618.00s -> 1621.12s]  I would just throw gas canisters over here.
[1621.12s -> 1622.86s]  I would just fucking punch people.
[1623.26s -> 1625.42s]  That would happen, and it just would.
[1626.14s -> 1627.57s]  I would get lost somewhere,
[1627.57s -> 1630.37s]  and I would just start karate chopping people.
[1631.17s -> 1632.37s]  And I do that anyways.
[1642.26s -> 1643.06s]  Understandable.
[1643.06s -> 1643.70s]  Have a nice day.
[1647.06s -> 1647.78s]  Propane tank.
[1658.83s -> 1659.15s]  All right.
[1659.15s -> 1660.11s]  So let's save us here.
[1660.91s -> 1663.38s]  Let me help you with that.
[1674.10s -> 1677.06s]  Another boyfriend?
[1677.06s -> 1678.66s]  Another boyfriend?
[1678.66s -> 1678.98s]  What?
[1684.10s -> 1696.03s]  Is he your boyfriend?
[1696.03s -> 1696.75s]  What is that?
[1696.75s -> 1697.47s]  The go-to.
[1703.41s -> 1704.69s]  Who else is going to explode?
[1705.73s -> 1713.55s]  I love that so much.
[1714.90s -> 1715.94s]  Who is this guy?
[1716.82s -> 1718.02s]  Is he your boyfriend?
[1719.46s -> 1722.35s]  The canned dialogue.
[1722.59s -> 1723.87s]  I turned off the stove.
[1723.87s -> 1724.35s]  Shoot him.
[1724.35s -> 1726.59s]  If you could take a couple of steps back,
[1727.86s -> 1729.46s]  make me a little more comfortable.
[1731.74s -> 1733.02s]  Investigate distraction?
[1742.27s -> 1744.67s]  Why would that be a distraction from that far away?
[1753.92s -> 1755.36s]  Somebody turned on the gas over here.
[1758.00s -> 1761.12s]  I know I'm going to make a joke that's been made a thousand fucking times before,
[1761.84s -> 1764.24s]  but honest to God, that's like the
[1765.04s -> 1767.28s]  don't touch the thermostat family guy joke.
[1767.28s -> 1768.16s]  And I'm not going to make it,
[1768.16s -> 1772.32s]  but I'm just saying like he heard the thermostat from like that far away.
[1776.32s -> 1777.12s]  I didn't make it.
[1777.12s -> 1777.92s]  I didn't make the joke.
[1780.61s -> 1781.57s]  I didn't say anything.
[1781.57s -> 1782.21s]  Wait, he's leaving.
[1782.85s -> 1794.86s]  Go get rat poison.
[1795.42s -> 1800.42s]  Well, that would make sense now, wouldn't it?
[1800.42s -> 1801.86s]  Pick up meaty bone.
[1802.50s -> 1804.40s]  Can I eat?
[1807.28s -> 1808.72s]  I can't eat the meaty bone.
[1810.75s -> 1811.39s]  Oh shit.
[1811.39s -> 1812.35s]  I got to hide this guy.
[1814.72s -> 1815.52s]  Where can I put him?
[1824.59s -> 1825.63s]  That wouldn't be a good idea.
[1830.77s -> 1831.73s]  Can I stuff him in the cupboard?
[1832.37s -> 1837.71s]  There's got to be a closet right here.
[1842.48s -> 1843.52s]  Put him on the stove.
[1844.66s -> 1845.14s]  All right.
[1845.14s -> 1846.90s]  So I got to get rat poison now.
[1850.88s -> 1852.24s]  Is this cooked or is this raw?
[1877.54s -> 1878.50s]  I just turned it off.
[1879.62s -> 1880.66s]  What are they searching for?
[1913.07s -> 1914.19s]  Does she not know how to turn it on?
[1914.91s -> 1916.27s]  She doesn't know how to work the TV.
[1923.55s -> 1932.61s]  How does it keep turning off?
[1948.58s -> 1949.06s]  Idiot.
[1952.18s -> 1953.22s]  Didn't I have poison?
[1954.02s -> 1956.64s]  I poisoned this cup.
[1958.72s -> 1959.04s]  Thank you.
[1962.64s -> 1963.84s]  Rat poison.
[1963.84s -> 1966.80s]  It's probably some like let's suspiciously go out the window.
[1967.44s -> 1970.34s]  I put the bone over here.
[1974.38s -> 1976.06s]  Poison TV power button.
[1996.93s -> 1998.45s]  Why am I trying to jump out the windows?
[1999.95s -> 2000.83s]  I'm now the server.
[2003.34s -> 2005.26s]  Poison the whole barbecue.
[2005.26s -> 2006.30s]  I'm not going to do that.
[2006.86s -> 2007.66s]  Is that what I'm going to do?
[2008.30s -> 2009.58s]  That's not what I'm about to do, right?
[2022.58s -> 2023.54s]  Start serving people.
[2025.90s -> 2026.54s]  Serve food.
[2027.18s -> 2028.22s]  Now we don't want to add this.
[2040.30s -> 2041.10s]  Some seasoning.
[2042.37s -> 2043.97s]  That was just a little bit of garlic salt.
[2043.97s -> 2044.61s]  Celery salt.
[2045.49s -> 2045.73s]  There.
[2045.73s -> 2046.29s]  Go ahead sir.
[2047.01s -> 2047.81s]  Care for a taste.
[2053.55s -> 2054.27s]  Special seasoning.
[2054.27s -> 2054.99s]  Yes.
[2054.99s -> 2056.19s]  Glad to be of service.
[2059.54s -> 2060.18s]  How does it taste?
[2063.18s -> 2064.78s]  Maybe why don't you come over here and add some seasoning.
[2067.90s -> 2068.30s]  Hold on.
[2068.30s -> 2069.66s]  Are they going to fill up the bathrooms?
[2078.11s -> 2080.27s]  They're all going to go into the bathrooms?
[2082.03s -> 2082.83s]  Oh no way.
[2085.54s -> 2086.26s]  Where is he going?
[2088.18s -> 2089.46s]  Oh thanks.
[2089.46s -> 2093.97s]  You're welcome.
[2093.97s -> 2095.09s]  He's going in that bathroom.
[2095.65s -> 2097.49s]  Are they all going to try to go into the same bathroom?
[2098.21s -> 2101.47s]  I kind of need to find out, right?
[2102.11s -> 2103.39s]  They're all going to go to the same bathroom.
[2126.85s -> 2127.57s]  Here's this guy.
[2130.88s -> 2131.68s]  Where's the other guy?
[2140.61s -> 2141.81s]  Didn't this guy just eat it?
[2141.81s -> 2142.61s]  How is he fine?
[2155.39s -> 2157.31s]  I need to, you need to keep poisoning it.
[2159.79s -> 2160.51s]  Oh, I don't.
[2161.31s -> 2163.79s]  Only the one guy got poisoned.
[2165.41s -> 2166.21s]  You should try this.
[2173.70s -> 2174.58s]  Well, oh well.
[2176.10s -> 2177.38s]  Obtain rat poison.
[2177.38s -> 2178.42s]  Can I go get more?
[2181.10s -> 2182.14s]  Hold on a minute.
[2182.14s -> 2190.91s]  So you want me to, like I'm going to reload.
[2190.91s -> 2192.27s]  I'm going to poison it every time.
[2195.58s -> 2196.70s]  So I have one rat poison.
[2197.50s -> 2198.70s]  I need to find another rat poison.
[2209.28s -> 2210.40s]  Use laxatives.
[2210.40s -> 2212.80s]  I don't have, now I'm going to have to go on like a search for those.
[2213.60s -> 2218.38s]  Well, whatever.
[2219.52s -> 2220.56s]  I'll just wait for him to come in.
[2220.56s -> 2222.64s]  Alright folks, the food is ready.
[2223.81s -> 2225.01s]  Poison the one that you should.
[2225.01s -> 2227.09s]  Yeah, I know, but I told you.
[2227.97s -> 2230.26s]  There's something weird to do.
[2230.26s -> 2230.90s]  I want to try it.
[2232.26s -> 2232.98s]  Excuse me.
[2233.62s -> 2234.42s]  Care for a snack.
[2235.46s -> 2239.86s]  I didn't poison it, right?
[2240.74s -> 2241.30s]  Sure thing.
[2241.94s -> 2248.64s]  Hello.
[2248.64s -> 2250.24s]  I tempt you with a little snack.
[2250.24s -> 2251.12s]  Flip the table.
[2255.18s -> 2260.29s]  Why are they playing this music in this current time period?
[2261.01s -> 2265.01s]  This does feel like a 50s party, doesn't it?
[2265.01s -> 2266.45s]  You want to try something?
[2266.45s -> 2267.17s]  Alright, here he comes.
[2268.37s -> 2270.45s]  Let's hope he likes his food, 47.
[2271.33s -> 2271.97s]  Thanks so much.
[2272.53s -> 2273.25s]  Sure.
[2273.25s -> 2273.97s]  Well, here he comes.
[2280.45s -> 2282.94s]  What?
[2289.57s -> 2304.30s]  So, was I supposed to poison that guy?
[2305.58s -> 2306.38s]  Or this dude?
[2308.38s -> 2308.94s]  Oh, here we go.
[2308.94s -> 2309.66s]  This dude right here.
[2309.66s -> 2310.62s]  Can I call you Rich?
[2312.62s -> 2313.18s]  Need something?
[2315.66s -> 2315.98s]  Hey.
[2315.98s -> 2316.78s]  This is what I like to eat.
[2316.78s -> 2318.94s]  Care to try something special?
[2328.88s -> 2330.16s]  Thanks so much.
[2330.16s -> 2332.16s]  Yeah, make sure to pick the one with extra seasoning.
[2332.88s -> 2340.64s]  What's going on?
[2341.20s -> 2342.40s]  Why don't you give this a try?
[2342.88s -> 2343.38s]  No way.
[2347.01s -> 2348.05s]  Excuse me.
[2348.05s -> 2349.57s]  You should try this.
[2349.57s -> 2351.01s]  It really is to die for.
[2354.40s -> 2355.28s]  Who wants a taste?
[2355.92s -> 2356.42s]  You?
[2356.88s -> 2357.52s]  Go ahead.
[2357.52s -> 2358.02s]  No way.
[2359.62s -> 2360.12s]  You sure?
[2362.51s -> 2363.01s]  You sure?
[2363.95s -> 2364.45s]  Excuse me.
[2366.21s -> 2366.71s]  Hey.
[2366.77s -> 2367.44s]  You okay?
[2372.62s -> 2378.48s]  Keep it in and you can do it.
[2378.48s -> 2379.36s]  Now shoot him.
[2379.36s -> 2379.86s]  No.
[2380.40s -> 2385.87s]  How long do I plan on serving food?
[2385.87s -> 2387.55s]  Uh, maybe another 20 minutes or so.
[2388.35s -> 2391.07s]  I'm gonna be in this bathroom, right?
[2391.07s -> 2391.57s]  Okay.
[2391.89s -> 2397.51s]  Look, I'm not only in my server, but I'm also a bathroom attendant.
[2403.08s -> 2403.96s]  What did he just drop?
[2403.96s -> 2404.76s]  He just dropped a bunch of-
[2406.68s -> 2407.18s]  Okay.
[2424.55s -> 2426.82s]  Should have drowned him.
[2427.38s -> 2428.90s]  He threw up all the newspapers.
[2428.90s -> 2429.78s]  Well, I have him now.
[2429.78s -> 2430.28s]  All right.
[2430.74s -> 2431.24s]  I'm ready.
[2432.31s -> 2433.51s]  Now I am the mailman.
[2434.31s -> 2447.14s]  So now I can deliver the mail.
[2448.10s -> 2448.60s]  Hi there.
[2449.94s -> 2450.44s]  Get out of the way.
[2455.19s -> 2456.07s]  Go get some fries.
[2456.79s -> 2458.55s]  You know, I did hear that the fries are really good.
[2459.11s -> 2460.15s]  Maybe I should try one.
[2462.72s -> 2464.08s]  What if I serve as the mailman?
[2466.08s -> 2466.80s]  No, I can't.
[2466.80s -> 2468.08s]  I can't serve food as the mailman.
[2476.26s -> 2478.10s]  That is Nolan Cassidy.
[2478.66s -> 2482.02s]  Former Secret Service agent in current Providence House.
[2482.02s -> 2484.50s]  Cassidy is assigned to protect James.
[2484.50s -> 2486.58s]  Well, now we're doing the mailman arc.
[2488.20s -> 2489.40s]  I'll just wait my turn.
[2490.90s -> 2491.78s]  He's here now.
[2491.78s -> 2493.78s]  It only took you like 10 minutes to get here.
[2500.37s -> 2502.13s]  I could have just poisoned him and drowned him.
[2526.45s -> 2527.57s]  I gotta get him out of his loop.
[2528.53s -> 2529.03s]  What?
[2531.33s -> 2531.89s]  What is that?
[2531.89s -> 2532.77s]  What is she doing that for?
[2533.41s -> 2535.43s]  I don't understand.
[2535.43s -> 2535.93s]  What's this for?
[2536.55s -> 2543.51s]  Why does she have a question mark?
[2544.23s -> 2544.95s]  I need poison.
[2545.67s -> 2546.93s]  Poison, quick.
[2547.73s -> 2549.09s]  If I was poisoned, I know where I'd be.
[2549.09s -> 2550.21s]  In somebody's house.
[2550.21s -> 2550.85s]  Somebody's garage.
[2553.16s -> 2553.88s]  He's still con-
[2553.88s -> 2554.20s]  He doesn't-
[2554.20s -> 2554.70s]  He's gone.
[2557.88s -> 2559.00s]  Is that even blood in her head?
[2559.88s -> 2561.00s]  That's a flower.
[2561.00s -> 2566.80s]  Yeah, he's leaving.
[2567.36s -> 2573.74s]  Okay.
[2573.74s -> 2574.52s]  Time to be the mailman.
[2580.48s -> 2580.98s]  What?
[2583.70s -> 2584.90s]  I am the mailman.
[2585.54s -> 2586.98s]  What do you mean the opportunity passed?
[2587.54s -> 2588.02s]  The guy-
[2588.02s -> 2589.30s]  I- I am the mailman.
[2609.24s -> 2610.52s]  Oh, Mr. Wilson!
[2618.96s -> 2620.48s]  Nolan Cassidy is down.
[2620.48s -> 2621.92s]  Good work for his-
[2621.92s -> 2622.64s]  Whoa, what?
[2623.73s -> 2626.13s]  That guy just was being dragged up by his feet.
[2628.36s -> 2628.76s]  All right.
[2628.76s -> 2629.48s]  So I'm gonna-
[2629.48s -> 2630.04s]  I have to wait.
[2633.51s -> 2634.79s]  I just have to wait.
[2634.79s -> 2636.71s]  I just have to serve people and wait for him to get here.
[2643.89s -> 2645.09s]  All right, folks.
[2645.09s -> 2646.21s]  The food is ready.
[2646.77s -> 2648.05s]  He's gonna take so long.
[2648.05s -> 2649.01s]  Oh, god damn it.
[2650.56s -> 2651.36s]  I gotta think of something-
[2651.68s -> 2652.80s]  I just relax.
[2652.80s -> 2653.28s]  I'll be fine.
[2653.28s -> 2654.08s]  Do you have me relax?
[2654.88s -> 2657.76s]  That was a Dennis the Menace joke in 2018.
[2658.56s -> 2659.75s]  That's true.
[2660.82s -> 2662.74s]  You really do have to serve for 20 minutes.
[2664.42s -> 2665.62s]  That person thought that I was making a-
[2665.62s -> 2667.30s]  A joke?
[2667.30s -> 2667.80s]  No?
[2668.18s -> 2669.70s]  I actually have to wait till he gets over here.
[2669.70s -> 2670.34s]  Whatever he's doing.
[2670.34s -> 2670.84s]  Yes, thanks.
[2671.46s -> 2672.74s]  No, thank you.
[2678.13s -> 2679.33s]  Mail guy.
[2679.33s -> 2681.73s]  See, the problem there was-
[2681.73s -> 2682.69s]  I was supposed to-
[2685.49s -> 2688.53s]  I was supposed to take out the mailman before he came to get food.
[2689.25s -> 2691.24s]  I did it in reverse.
[2694.04s -> 2694.52s]  All right.
[2694.52s -> 2696.20s]  Serve a guest to make room for Cassidy.
[2696.20s -> 2697.16s]  But Cassidy's not here.
[2697.96s -> 2700.05s]  Should I just wait till he gets here?
[2702.39s -> 2704.20s]  Wrap your lips around this.
[2705.24s -> 2706.44s]  Is he your boyfriend or something?
[2707.46s -> 2709.54s]  Let's hope he likes his food, 47.
[2709.54s -> 2711.06s]  Okay, mission story completed.
[2711.06s -> 2711.54s]  But I-
[2711.54s -> 2712.04s]  No, I didn't.
[2712.82s -> 2713.94s]  It's made just for you.
[2717.52s -> 2718.48s]  He's still not here.
[2719.12s -> 2720.90s]  I just have to sit here.
[2729.16s -> 2730.04s]  See, this is why-
[2730.04s -> 2731.48s]  Here comes the mailman again.
[2736.18s -> 2737.78s]  The mailman is the real target.
[2748.28s -> 2749.56s]  See, he comes over and talks.
[2749.56s -> 2750.28s]  He's like, hey, Rich.
[2760.47s -> 2761.03s]  Mail-
[2761.03s -> 2762.71s]  I'm not gonna poison the mailman again.
[2763.59s -> 2765.91s]  He's gonna make his way over here
[2765.91s -> 2767.27s]  after whatever he's doing over there.
[2767.27s -> 2768.15s]  And then I'm gonna-
[2768.15s -> 2769.03s]  I'm gonna take him out.
[2769.91s -> 2774.02s]  Why does the chef have snowboard glasses on?
[2774.02s -> 2776.55s]  That's a great question.
[2778.76s -> 2779.40s]  Excuse me.
[2780.04s -> 2780.92s]  Care for a snack?
[2782.45s -> 2784.69s]  He rubbed his belly to indicate he was hungry.
[2787.64s -> 2788.58s]  My pleasure.
[2789.14s -> 2794.79s]  Oh, wait, I forgot.
[2794.79s -> 2795.83s]  I can't have fried food.
[2803.43s -> 2804.31s]  You should try this.
[2808.16s -> 2808.66s]  Hello.
[2809.20s -> 2811.12s]  Can I tempt you with a little snack?
[2812.56s -> 2813.81s]  Here it comes.
[2813.81s -> 2815.09s]  All right, get out of the way then.
[2815.09s -> 2816.53s]  He's like smiffing.
[2816.53s -> 2817.17s]  What is this like?
[2817.73s -> 2818.37s]  Oh, gosh.
[2819.01s -> 2820.53s]  Get out of the way then.
[2821.17s -> 2823.03s]  Here it comes.
[2823.03s -> 2828.42s]  Wanna try something different?
[2835.30s -> 2836.90s]  All right, get the fuck out of here.
[2840.37s -> 2840.93s]  Oh my god.
[2840.93s -> 2841.49s]  Get out of the way.
[2850.93s -> 2851.57s]  Okay, it's poisoned.
[2868.21s -> 2868.69s]  Mister-
[2868.69s -> 2869.57s]  I don't do small talk.
[2869.57s -> 2870.61s]  Mister Mailman.
[2874.05s -> 2874.69s]  There you go.
[2874.69s -> 2875.49s]  It's an open spot.
[2882.15s -> 2883.43s]  He never had french fries before?
[2886.72s -> 2888.48s]  He's very confused by french fries.
[2907.36s -> 2907.86s]  What?
[2915.99s -> 2919.11s]  Hey, hey, just in case you want to know, man, you're sick.
[2919.11s -> 2922.39s]  You probably should go see somebody or something at some point or something.
[2927.72s -> 2928.52s]  Is this a doctor?
[2930.37s -> 2931.91s]  Wait a minute.
[2931.91s -> 2933.19s]  Is that his personal doctor?
[2935.19s -> 2948.68s]  He's not going in there with him, is he?
[2949.48s -> 2950.76s]  Why are you both going in here?
[2955.19s -> 2959.49s]  What?
[2959.49s -> 2960.45s]  What is-
[2960.45s -> 2977.04s]  There we go.
[2977.04s -> 2977.76s]  We got to see it.
[2981.12s -> 2981.76s]  It was an accident.
[2984.61s -> 2986.05s]  That was an accident.
[2986.05s -> 2987.17s]  I can't dress up as him?
[2987.89s -> 2988.77s]  Oh shit.
[2988.77s -> 2989.65s]  What do I put him?
[2989.65s -> 2990.15s]  Oh, in here.
[2995.19s -> 2996.79s]  Hold my hair, isn't it?
[2996.79s -> 2997.83s]  That's the challenge.
[2999.20s -> 3000.48s]  He accidentally drowned.
[3000.48s -> 3001.92s]  All right, so now what if-
[3001.92s -> 3004.64s]  So I'm going to come out here and he's not going to come out.
[3004.64s -> 3006.00s]  So what does this guy have to say about that?
[3006.72s -> 3009.00s]  You know what I mean?
[3011.20s -> 3013.20s]  You're obviously waiting for him to come out of the bathroom.
[3033.08s -> 3033.58s]  What?
[3034.12s -> 3035.16s]  Why would you hear this?
[3037.89s -> 3038.39s]  What?
[3040.47s -> 3042.15s]  He's like, he came to investigate?
[3043.91s -> 3044.41s]  You know.
[3052.64s -> 3053.12s]  Why would-
[3054.00s -> 3054.88s]  I don't understand.
[3054.88s -> 3055.28s]  Why-
[3055.28s -> 3056.24s]  You were standing next to the door.
[3056.24s -> 3058.32s]  Why would you come all the way across here?
[3060.31s -> 3061.51s]  All right, so I got-
[3061.51s -> 3062.01s]  He's dead.
[3063.16s -> 3065.88s]  I'm going to try to make my way over to the residence.
[3065.88s -> 3067.48s]  I got the key now so I can just go in.
[3070.36s -> 3070.92s]  But first.
[3081.81s -> 3082.31s]  Okay.
[3091.24s -> 3091.74s]  No!
[3097.54s -> 3099.94s]  That's the same person that I drowned before.
[3099.94s -> 3100.58s]  God damn it.
[3103.62s -> 3106.64s]  That's the same person I drowned.
[3117.32s -> 3118.44s]  All right, we're good.
[3118.44s -> 3118.84s]  We're done.
[3120.79s -> 3122.39s]  What did that person deserve?
[3122.39s -> 3123.27s]  Absolutely nothing.
[3124.55s -> 3125.67s]  They didn't deserve that at all.
[3126.39s -> 3132.82s]  They just happened to be standing in this spot in front of me.
[3133.99s -> 3136.84s]  All right, so let's take a look.
[3138.04s -> 3139.67s]  Mr. Cassidy is dead.
[3140.31s -> 3144.32s]  The real question is.
[3145.12s -> 3145.84s]  I need to get-
[3145.84s -> 3146.80s]  I'm going to go to the front.
[3147.44s -> 3148.32s]  I'm going to go this way.
[3149.36s -> 3151.44s]  Actually, there's a clue over here.
[3152.24s -> 3155.38s]  Let's see what this is.
[3158.02s -> 3158.66s]  Public park.
[3161.96s -> 3162.84s]  Poison water bottle.
[3162.84s -> 3163.56s]  I don't have any poison.
[3164.20s -> 3166.63s]  Pick up the hammer.
[3166.63s -> 3167.43s]  Yep.
[3167.43s -> 3169.43s]  Charles Blake III for a better world.
[3169.43s -> 3169.93s]  Okay.
[3175.43s -> 3176.47s]  Oh, there's the mailman again.
[3176.47s -> 3177.03s]  The mailman was-
[3177.03s -> 3177.59s]  What do you even-
[3177.59s -> 3178.71s]  Oh, I get it.
[3178.71s -> 3179.83s]  Do you deliver mail?
[3179.83s -> 3183.03s]  When I was your age, I didn't like having my route interrupted either.
[3183.03s -> 3184.15s]  I'll let you focus.
[3184.15s -> 3185.59s]  Just give it some thought.
[3185.59s -> 3187.51s]  I'll put a good word in for you if you need it.
[3187.51s -> 3188.15s]  Okay.
[3188.15s -> 3189.03s]  Thanks, I guess.
[3190.39s -> 3191.51s]  Is this missed?
[3191.51s -> 3192.23s]  Excuse me, sir.
[3192.23s -> 3193.99s]  Are you a registered voter?
[3193.99s -> 3197.19s]  I'd love to tell you about a new candidate who might just change your life.
[3197.19s -> 3197.59s]  Yes, sir.
[3197.59s -> 3198.87s]  A total game changer.
[3198.87s -> 3199.19s]  Okay.
[3199.19s -> 3200.07s]  I'm listening.
[3200.07s -> 3200.57s]  Wonderful.
[3201.43s -> 3205.11s]  Well, I'm sure you're aware that voting season is upon us again.
[3205.11s -> 3205.67s]  Yeah.
[3205.75s -> 3210.23s]  And if you're anything like me, a recent immigrant to this fine country,
[3210.23s -> 3215.33s]  the candidates this time around just aren't very, um, savory.
[3215.33s -> 3219.01s]  But we have a man here today who's about to change all that.
[3219.01s -> 3221.33s]  I don't care much for politics.
[3221.33s -> 3225.33s]  That is exactly why Blake is out ringing doorbells today.
[3225.33s -> 3225.89s]  Mr. Cassidy.
[3225.89s -> 3228.93s]  He has no stakes in Washington.
[3228.93s -> 3235.09s]  No connections to the establishment, no allies hidden away in lawless groups
[3235.09s -> 3236.93s]  that pull the strings around the world.
[3237.97s -> 3244.28s]  He's just a common man who decided that he wouldn't take it anymore.
[3244.28s -> 3245.24s]  He's looking for him.
[3245.24s -> 3246.44s]  He's here to clean up.
[3246.44s -> 3248.04s]  He doesn't know where he is.
[3248.04s -> 3251.00s]  Give him exactly what you want, and to make sure the government
[3251.00s -> 3254.60s]  doesn't stick his nose into everything.
[3254.60s -> 3255.32s]  Fascinating.
[3256.20s -> 3258.36s]  How is he going to achieve all that?
[3258.36s -> 3261.88s]  By imposing restrictions and pushing crippling laws
[3261.88s -> 3265.32s]  that will bind legislators to their desks for decades.
[3266.04s -> 3266.68s]  His approach-
[3266.68s -> 3268.44s]  He's going to keep doing that forever.
[3268.44s -> 3269.96s]  I couldn't even pay attention to this.
[3269.96s -> 3271.72s]  Washington-based desk jockeys.
[3271.72s -> 3275.96s]  So much work they simply won't have time to enforce the existing laws.
[3276.52s -> 3277.64s]  Cassidy!
[3277.64s -> 3278.60s]  While they're busy looking-
[3278.60s -> 3279.56s]  Cassidy, can you hear me?
[3279.56s -> 3285.24s]  The law books use his executive powers to undo the existing laws.
[3285.24s -> 3288.12s]  It's a radical approach, short, but quite effective.
[3288.12s -> 3293.48s]  And this Blake character, he's out here now ringing doorbells?
[3293.48s -> 3294.04s]  Sure is.
[3294.04s -> 3294.92s]  Why'd you ask?
[3294.92s -> 3295.64s]  No reason.
[3295.64s -> 3296.28s]  Good on you.
[3296.28s -> 3297.88s]  Be sure to vote come election day.
[3297.88s -> 3299.24s]  I've got to become Mr. Blake.
[3299.24s -> 3301.40s]  Feel free to spread the word about Charles Blake III.
[3301.40s -> 3302.28s]  Have a flyer.
[3302.28s -> 3304.36s]  Charles Blake III appreciates your support.
[3305.00s -> 3305.88s]  Well, I definitely want to-
[3305.88s -> 3307.08s]  Okay, he's out here ringing doorbells.
[3307.08s -> 3308.28s]  That's what he looks like.
[3308.28s -> 3308.78s]  Okay.
[3309.72s -> 3313.51s]  Hey, how are you?
[3313.51s -> 3314.07s]  How you doing?
[3317.33s -> 3318.13s]  Is that him right there?
[3318.93s -> 3321.25s]  That's him right there.
[3324.16s -> 3325.12s]  There he is.
[3325.12s -> 3325.84s]  Cassidy!
[3335.19s -> 3336.95s]  You're going to give a flyer to yourself?
[3337.59s -> 3346.55s]  I checked the phone.
[3346.55s -> 3351.03s]  Three people since morning, Aidan.
[3351.11s -> 3351.59s]  Oh, no.
[3351.59s -> 3352.79s]  We talked about the importance of the election.
[3352.79s -> 3354.15s]  Good afternoon, sir.
[3354.15s -> 3356.05s]  Or have you completely-
[3356.05s -> 3357.17s]  We lost three followers.
[3357.17s -> 3358.93s]  Sir, I absolutely did not.
[3358.93s -> 3364.93s]  It's terrible, I see.
[3364.93s -> 3365.97s]  You hear me?
[3365.97s -> 3366.85s]  That's not fair.
[3366.85s -> 3369.49s]  I've given out like a hundred of them already.
[3369.49s -> 3372.05s]  I don't keep you around for your excuses.
[3377.17s -> 3379.36s]  Well, okay.
[3379.36s -> 3380.32s]  Have a flyer.
[3380.32s -> 3382.48s]  Read more about Charles Blake III in it.
[3382.48s -> 3384.48s]  So when does he have diarrhea?
[3385.36s -> 3387.96s]  He's going to go in that outhouse right there.
[3393.28s -> 3394.64s]  And I don't have-
[3394.72s -> 3397.28s]  The only intel I have on him is the flyer.
[3397.28s -> 3397.92s]  Where's the flyer?
[3397.92s -> 3398.72s]  I'm going to see the flyer.
[3402.45s -> 3403.17s]  Apple a day.
[3405.33s -> 3406.21s]  Whack-a-mole.
[3406.21s -> 3407.25s]  So this is not even on here.
[3407.25s -> 3408.21s]  This is a secret one.
[3408.21s -> 3408.53s]  All right.
[3408.53s -> 3409.25s]  So objectives.
[3410.82s -> 3411.22s]  Where's my-
[3413.08s -> 3414.28s]  That's not intel, the flyer.
[3416.12s -> 3416.92s]  Free burgers.
[3424.36s -> 3425.56s]  In the inventory?
[3425.56s -> 3429.41s]  Or you mean like this inventory?
[3429.41s -> 3431.17s]  Charles Blake III appreciates your support.
[3431.17s -> 3431.97s]  Wait, I don't want to lose him.
[3433.52s -> 3434.32s]  Where does he go?
[3434.32s -> 3434.64s]  He's going-
[3434.64s -> 3435.52s]  He goes door to door.
[3436.24s -> 3440.44s]  Okay.
[3440.44s -> 3441.56s]  He's going to sit here?
[3443.70s -> 3444.66s]  Don't throw a bone at him.
[3444.66s -> 3445.78s]  Don't do anything like that.
[3451.20s -> 3451.52s]  All right.
[3451.52s -> 3451.92s]  Let's go.
[3454.15s -> 3455.03s]  Political flyer.
[3455.75s -> 3457.83s]  This flyer outlines a political platform
[3457.83s -> 3460.15s]  of local politician wannabe Charles Blake III.
[3460.15s -> 3461.11s]  Reading through various parts,
[3461.11s -> 3463.19s]  it seems Blake is intent on using a higher office
[3463.19s -> 3465.03s]  as a way of transforming rules set forth
[3465.03s -> 3466.71s]  by the local homeowners association.
[3468.21s -> 3468.69s]  That's it.
[3477.40s -> 3479.00s]  I'm the only person here.
[3482.60s -> 3483.96s]  I've been here for so long too.
[3490.88s -> 3491.94s]  Yeah.
[3500.04s -> 3500.76s]  Yeah, I just-
[3500.76s -> 3502.28s]  I'm not sure who I want to vote for.
[3503.64s -> 3505.97s]  You seem like a nice guy.
[3506.77s -> 3512.44s]  What's your stance on more than five dogs in a house?
[3513.72s -> 3514.84s]  Would you be okay with that?
[3515.72s -> 3525.62s]  I know you're only allowed by the state to have three.
[3527.36s -> 3528.40s]  But I like-
[3528.40s -> 3530.00s]  I like having a lot of dogs.
[3530.80s -> 3531.92s]  Will you move somewhere?
[3537.19s -> 3538.39s]  Mr. Blake has many important initiatives to share.
[3538.39s -> 3539.11s]  Mr. Blake.
[3539.11s -> 3540.95s]  Did I miss everything about Mr. Blake?
[3540.95s -> 3542.15s]  I'm not going to just shoot him.
[3542.15s -> 3543.11s]  No, I need to-
[3543.11s -> 3543.51s]  I need to-
[3543.51s -> 3544.55s]  He needs to go somewhere.
[3545.51s -> 3551.96s]  Dammit.
[3551.96s -> 3561.25s]  Is he even linked to an opportunity?
[3561.25s -> 3563.41s]  No, I just wanted to see if I could like become that guy
[3563.41s -> 3564.37s]  and that would mean door to door
[3564.37s -> 3565.57s]  I could go knock on the door, right?
[3579.38s -> 3580.98s]  I got an achievement for that.
[3580.98s -> 3581.30s]  Okay.
[3585.48s -> 3586.12s]  I know there's a-
[3586.84s -> 3588.63s]  I know there's a real estate thing going on.
[3588.63s -> 3590.15s]  This guy's looking around still for the-
[3590.15s -> 3590.95s]  Sir!
[3590.95s -> 3592.07s]  Mr. Cassidy!
[3592.63s -> 3596.63s]  Are you okay?
[3596.71s -> 3597.67s]  Nolan Cassidy!
[3600.84s -> 3601.34s]  Hey!
[3601.72s -> 3603.84s]  How are you, Mr. Cassidy?
[3603.84s -> 3604.48s]  All right, I do-
[3604.48s -> 3606.48s]  I kind of need this gig, though.
[3606.48s -> 3606.98s]  What?
[3606.98s -> 3608.64s]  If you're unharmed, it'd be much appreciated.
[3608.64s -> 3611.60s]  He's in a random open house basement?
[3611.60s -> 3612.40s]  Mr. Cassidy!
[3613.57s -> 3615.73s]  I love hide and seek just as much as the next guy,
[3615.73s -> 3616.29s]  but come on.
[3629.08s -> 3630.04s]  Frame rate, stop!
[3631.14s -> 3631.64s]  Hey!
[3632.32s -> 3633.68s]  Where are you, Mr. Cassidy?
[3634.40s -> 3635.91s]  I kind of need this gig,
[3635.91s -> 3637.91s]  so if you could just show yourself unharmed,
[3637.91s -> 3639.19s]  it'd be much appreciated.
[3639.83s -> 3644.26s]  That's going to hurt me.
[3644.26s -> 3644.76s]  Hey!
[3645.76s -> 3646.56s]  Oh, shit!
[3646.56s -> 3648.80s]  That's a stone-cold knockout to the head!
[3663.24s -> 3664.52s]  Here's the best part about this.
[3665.16s -> 3666.61s]  He's going to wake up,
[3666.61s -> 3667.65s]  and guess what he's going to do.
[3668.53s -> 3670.18s]  Mr. Cassidy!
[3670.82s -> 3671.14s]  I don't-
[3671.14s -> 3672.26s]  I just woke up somewhere.
[3672.26s -> 3673.30s]  I don't know where I am right now,
[3673.30s -> 3674.18s]  I'm not sure, but-
[3674.18s -> 3675.22s]  Uh, where are you?
[3675.22s -> 3676.02s]  Mr. Cassidy!
[3676.82s -> 3678.74s]  A very big lump on my head.
[3679.30s -> 3683.35s]  Oh, I-
[3683.35s -> 3684.79s]  Actually, this is better disguised.
[3684.79s -> 3685.75s]  The guy's bodyguard?
[3686.39s -> 3687.35s]  Mr. Cassidy, I-
[3687.35s -> 3688.63s]  I woke up naked somewhere?
[3689.51s -> 3691.78s]  I mean, I'm not sure what this is, but-
[3692.50s -> 3695.01s]  I woke up next to a plumber?
[3695.73s -> 3697.80s]  I thought it was you?
[3697.80s -> 3698.44s]  Maybe?
[3698.44s -> 3699.16s]  It was a person?
[3699.88s -> 3704.93s]  Are you Cassidy?
[3708.18s -> 3709.22s]  Oh, shit!
[3709.22s -> 3710.34s]  Uh, is there any-
[3710.34s -> 3710.98s]  Whatever.
[3710.98s -> 3711.62s]  In the basement?
[3711.62s -> 3712.12s]  No.
[3713.09s -> 3713.89s]  You're fine.
[3713.89s -> 3714.39s]  Close it.
[3715.01s -> 3715.86s]  All right.
[3715.86s -> 3716.42s]  I can now go-
[3716.42s -> 3718.50s]  I'm just going to walk right into the Cassidy residence.
[3721.33s -> 3723.17s]  Mr. Cassidy, am I Cassidy?
[3723.81s -> 3725.65s]  Have I been Cassidy the whole time?
[3726.37s -> 3728.56s]  If you could tell me, that'd be nice, man.
[3731.78s -> 3732.26s]  All right.
[3732.26s -> 3732.82s]  Let's just-
[3732.82s -> 3733.46s]  What do I got?
[3734.02s -> 3737.17s]  Let's go meat bone this guy in the head as hard as we can.
[3738.45s -> 3738.95s]  Treehouse!
[3739.51s -> 3773.64s]  Please stand back.
[3773.64s -> 3774.36s]  I'll check it out.
[3776.60s -> 3777.16s]  Take care.
[3778.12s -> 3786.63s]  Anyone copy?
[3786.63s -> 3788.23s]  Looks like we got trouble on our hands.
[3788.23s -> 3788.95s]  Don't know what yet.
[3789.67s -> 3791.43s]  We need to secure the area.
[3791.43s -> 3793.27s]  I need you to get a car away as possible.
[3793.27s -> 3795.35s]  I need you to keep your head down.
[3795.35s -> 3796.15s]  You want to stay alive.
[3796.87s -> 3798.22s]  That lady saw me, I think.
[3798.94s -> 3800.86s]  I'm just trying to get him to come over to the-
[3800.86s -> 3801.74s]  Up in the treehouse.
[3802.30s -> 3807.08s]  What's that command?
[3807.08s -> 3808.04s]  What's that command?
[3808.04s -> 3808.60s]  Okay.
[3808.60s -> 3809.80s]  Yogi Bear is on the loose.
[3810.36s -> 3812.04s]  And he may have stole a picnic basket.
[3812.76s -> 3814.44s]  I'll be on lookout too.
[3814.76s -> 3821.62s]  Don't be kidding.
[3821.62s -> 3822.12s]  Again?
[3822.90s -> 3825.77s]  Oh yeah, I was gonna shoot up there too.
[3826.65s -> 3846.98s]  Come on up.
[3846.98s -> 3847.54s]  Come on up.
[3848.18s -> 3851.13s]  Come on up.
[3851.13s -> 3857.94s]  Come on up here.
[3857.94s -> 3858.74s]  Will you get up here?
[3859.78s -> 3868.07s]  That's some strong-
[3868.07s -> 3868.71s]  I'm out.
[3868.71s -> 3869.35s]  I'm out.
[3870.39s -> 3873.46s]  I'm out of bullets.
[3875.22s -> 3876.94s]  I don't even know where this guy is.
[3877.66s -> 3880.87s]  Oh, the thing that's geared by the tree.
[3880.87s -> 3881.67s]  Mr. Cassidy!
[3882.39s -> 3883.27s]  Mr. Cassidy!
[3889.61s -> 3890.17s]  Is that you?
[3890.81s -> 3892.47s]  Should I be shooting at you?
[3915.02s -> 3916.86s]  I can't like vault over that.
[3916.86s -> 3917.98s]  That's unfortunate.
[3917.98s -> 3918.62s]  All right, let's go.
[3924.70s -> 3925.20s]  Ow.
[3925.58s -> 3933.06s]  I'm a bodyguard here, so I-
[3933.06s -> 3933.78s]  This should be fine.
[3934.50s -> 3937.82s]  How would I be trespassing here?
[3937.82s -> 3939.02s]  I'm like a secret agent.
[3939.66s -> 3940.38s]  Secret agents-
[3940.38s -> 3942.86s]  I just flash my driver's license to this guy.
[3953.18s -> 3953.68s]  Oh!
[3961.26s -> 3962.06s]  The bird guy.
[3968.62s -> 3969.12s]  Bird guy.
[3970.46s -> 3971.42s]  Wait, like-
[3971.42s -> 3972.30s]  Like Flavor Bird?
[3985.58s -> 3986.94s]  I don't even need that though, man.
[3986.94s -> 3987.44s]  Look at me.
[3997.26s -> 3997.98s]  What was that for?
[4000.30s -> 4003.53s]  Why do they have a statue of like Michael Myers?
[4003.53s -> 4004.33s]  With like an axe.
[4013.43s -> 4014.47s]  Imagine if it was.
[4015.19s -> 4018.68s]  Imagine if your town just had like a statue of Michael Myers.
[4018.68s -> 4019.88s]  Like a big bronze statue.
[4020.60s -> 4039.46s]  No, I need that.
[4040.10s -> 4052.62s]  So I'm allowed to go in the house.
[4053.50s -> 4055.10s]  I'm just one of the bodyguards, right?
[4055.10s -> 4055.98s]  That would make sense.
[4057.02s -> 4057.52s]  Yeah, see?
[4058.38s -> 4059.02s]  You need a-
[4059.02s -> 4060.14s]  What about a frisk?
[4060.14s -> 4061.58s]  I'm the one that frisks you.
[4061.58s -> 4062.14s]  You understand?
[4064.04s -> 4064.76s]  Who the fuck are you?
[4065.00s -> 4066.20s]  You can't be here.
[4066.20s -> 4068.20s]  Who the fuck is this guy with the name tag?
[4069.08s -> 4070.84s]  Yeah, and stay out.
[4070.84s -> 4071.48s]  Are you serious?
[4072.20s -> 4087.59s]  To get rid of an aggressively invasive mole in this poor old man's backyard.
[4087.59s -> 4089.51s]  Calm down, demolition man.
[4089.51s -> 4092.87s]  Unless it's a flesh-eating mutant mole, you don't need explosives.
[4093.43s -> 4096.95s]  We're gonna keep them safe in our trunk until you produce that license, okay?
[4096.95s -> 4098.07s]  Come on, man.
[4098.07s -> 4104.23s]  One of Janus's gardeners has decided to clear a series of mole tunnels using explosives.
[4104.23s -> 4105.35s]  Explosions.
[4105.35s -> 4110.63s]  I applaud his enthusiasm, but sadly, local police have confiscated his equipment.
[4112.31s -> 4116.55s]  You stuff the holes, and then you blow up the tunnel system so it collapses.
[4116.55s -> 4117.83s]  Look it up on YouTube.
[4117.83s -> 4122.07s]  Sir, if the American pull you there, the bodyguard.
[4122.07s -> 4123.27s]  What's this guy's problem?
[4123.83s -> 4124.95s]  Is he your mate?
[4124.95s -> 4125.99s]  Don't touch that.
[4125.99s -> 4126.87s]  Get your hands off.
[4128.07s -> 4129.35s]  Mr. Nose, are you?
[4129.99s -> 4131.43s]  So keep your hands in the air.
[4132.23s -> 4142.71s]  I don't want to do that, though.
[4143.43s -> 4150.44s]  I think I'd rather just go in somehow.
[4151.90s -> 4156.14s]  I mean, explosives are fun, but I feel like I would just do that anyways, wouldn't I?
[4158.94s -> 4160.38s]  Back to the safety of the house.
[4160.38s -> 4161.26s]  Well, not for long.
[4166.74s -> 4168.34s]  Hey, why is this guy acting like a dog?
[4170.34s -> 4170.74s]  Shoot him.
[4171.54s -> 4175.29s]  All right, let's do this one.
[4175.29s -> 4176.25s]  We'll do the mole.
[4183.51s -> 4185.75s]  Seems like an interesting way to get in the house.
[4194.07s -> 4195.27s]  All right, I have a license for it.
[4196.15s -> 4196.63s]  This is it.
[4198.22s -> 4199.42s]  Story revealing.
[4199.42s -> 4200.30s]  Let's save.
[4201.90s -> 4202.54s]  Save it.
[4202.54s -> 4204.06s]  Right back to the safety of the treehouse.
[4204.06s -> 4204.86s]  No, not for long.
[4204.86s -> 4209.66s]  I need it to get rid of an aggressively invasive mole in this poor old man's backyard.
[4209.66s -> 4211.58s]  Calm down, demolition man.
[4211.58s -> 4213.26s]  Unless it's one of Janus's gods.
[4214.70s -> 4215.82s]  You don't need explosives.
[4216.38s -> 4219.58s]  We're going to keep them safe in our trunk until you produce that license, okay?
[4219.58s -> 4220.14s]  Yeah.
[4220.14s -> 4221.18s]  Police trunk.
[4221.18s -> 4222.06s]  Get a procedure.
[4222.70s -> 4226.94s]  You stuff the holes, and then you blow up the tunnel system so it collapses.
[4226.94s -> 4228.22s]  Look it up on YouTube.
[4228.22s -> 4231.90s]  Sir, if the American police force looked to YouTube as guiding principle for standard
[4231.90s -> 4235.82s]  procedure, I'm pretty sure civilization would have collapsed a long time ago.
[4235.82s -> 4236.62s]  God damn it.
[4237.66s -> 4238.22s]  YouTube.
[4239.88s -> 4242.84s]  All right, so I gotta follow the gardener around.
[4251.11s -> 4252.97s]  Yeah, that's what I like to see.
[4253.93s -> 4254.09s]  What?
[4254.89s -> 4259.46s]  So what's his routine?
[4259.46s -> 4260.90s]  We're gonna find out what his routine is.
[4265.50s -> 4266.78s]  He goes to the truck.
[4266.78s -> 4285.98s]  I've been holding onto that one for a long time.
[4292.89s -> 4294.01s]  I think I've already said that.
[4294.01s -> 4295.37s]  Do I have said that one yet?
[4296.66s -> 4298.18s]  I think I've already said it.
[4298.18s -> 4301.22s]  I've been singing that like in the shower for like the last fucking three weeks.
[4301.94s -> 4305.19s]  I've done that already.
[4305.19s -> 4306.07s]  I have.
[4306.07s -> 4307.51s]  So I forgot that I've already said it.
[4308.15s -> 4311.66s]  Where can I put them?
[4311.66s -> 4318.23s]  Put them in the mailbox.
[4318.23s -> 4319.86s]  Can I put them in the trash?
[4320.50s -> 4338.76s]  Come on, that's funny though.
[4338.76s -> 4340.28s]  Like that's a funny line.
[4342.86s -> 4344.38s]  I can't put them in the trash.
[4344.38s -> 4358.68s]  All right, what else do I need?
[4360.14s -> 4361.42s]  I'm not the bodyguard anymore.
[4361.42s -> 4362.46s]  I've got his stuff.
[4363.18s -> 4367.18s]  That's a stand-up comic from 2002.
[4367.18s -> 4368.78s]  That doesn't mean that it wasn't funny.
[4371.08s -> 4372.28s]  It wasn't meant to be funny.
[4372.28s -> 4372.84s]  It was meant to be.
[4372.84s -> 4374.60s]  That's what I've been singing in the shower.
[4374.60s -> 4378.20s]  While the steam fills my eyes and it fucks with my cognitive ability.
[4378.20s -> 4380.04s]  So obviously I thought it would be funnier.
[4381.10s -> 4382.70s]  Sir, this is a restricted area.
[4383.58s -> 4394.15s]  Can I pick up?
[4394.15s -> 4396.47s]  Oh, well, this is lagging the game.
[4397.11s -> 4399.90s]  Can I get in here?
[4399.90s -> 4401.69s]  This person had been home for a while.
[4416.70s -> 4418.54s]  This whole area is out of bounds.
[4420.06s -> 4421.10s]  Whoa, psycho.
[4421.10s -> 4422.06s]  I saw that.
[4422.06s -> 4423.02s]  What are you, crazy?
[4425.62s -> 4426.98s]  Don't come in here.
[4426.98s -> 4427.54s]  Don't move.
[4432.98s -> 4434.10s]  Surrender yourself.
[4435.54s -> 4436.82s]  Sir, I will have to ask you.
[4437.38s -> 4438.18s]  Look at that guy.
[4438.18s -> 4439.61s]  Starting street fight.
[4439.61s -> 4440.49s]  Suspect is hit.
[4440.49s -> 4441.21s]  Take him down.
[4441.21s -> 4442.33s]  I understand.
[4442.33s -> 4443.13s]  Oh my.
[4443.13s -> 4459.46s]  I thought I was gonna be able to get away with it.
[4464.28s -> 4465.00s]  What?
[4465.00s -> 4468.58s]  Why did this auto save?
[4471.37s -> 4472.01s]  Lining up the shot.
[4472.01s -> 4473.21s]  Hey, I was leading my target.
[4473.21s -> 4474.81s]  He was eventually gonna come over there, guys.
[4488.18s -> 4489.06s]  You're not allowed in here.
[4489.06s -> 4489.70s]  Okay, sure.
[4491.19s -> 4492.07s]  Clown to my left.
[4492.07s -> 4492.71s]  Clown to my right.
[4493.43s -> 4496.97s]  You know, where the fuck could I possibly be?
[4510.07s -> 4511.35s]  This is not suspicious at all.
[4511.91s -> 4514.20s]  I'm just checking on the fence.
[4514.20s -> 4514.70s]  Hey.
[4515.56s -> 4516.06s]  Okay.
[4536.38s -> 4536.88s]  He doesn't.
[4539.02s -> 4539.58s]  Everything's good.
[4539.58s -> 4540.08s]  Okay.
[4542.58s -> 4543.30s]  He can hear this.
[4544.10s -> 4546.02s]  He can hear like the animal in the bush.
[4547.61s -> 4548.33s]  Oh god.
[4548.33s -> 4549.61s]  Does he even turn around?
[4554.02s -> 4554.52s]  Geez.
[4555.22s -> 4558.39s]  Don't come over here.
[4558.39s -> 4559.27s]  Just, no.
[4559.27s -> 4559.83s]  I gotta sit.
[4566.44s -> 4579.50s]  Hey, you all right?
[4583.37s -> 4585.21s]  You must have seen the son of a bitch.
[4585.21s -> 4586.41s]  Sorry, I didn't see nothing.
[4586.41s -> 4587.29s]  I have no idea.
[4589.38s -> 4591.30s]  I got hit with meat out of a bush.
[4592.26s -> 4593.30s]  I have no idea.
[4593.30s -> 4594.18s]  And I'm gonna go home.
[4594.74s -> 4596.26s]  I'm gonna go get my mom now.
[4596.98s -> 4598.10s]  I pooped my pants.
[4608.06s -> 4608.94s]  Haha, poo.
[4621.82s -> 4622.46s]  Well, all right.
[4622.46s -> 4625.18s]  So I make like a reference to an old song
[4625.18s -> 4628.06s]  and change the lyrics incredibly brilliantly.
[4628.06s -> 4628.56s]  And I...
[4629.26s -> 4630.14s]  That was not funny.
[4630.14s -> 4631.66s]  I say the word poo out loud.
[4633.30s -> 4634.50s]  I'm gonna go poo my pants.
[4643.96s -> 4645.40s]  Oh, he's coming back.
[4645.40s -> 4647.16s]  No, I had an opportunity to do this.
[4648.58s -> 4649.94s]  Oh, come on.
[4649.94s -> 4650.44s]  Oh.
[4666.84s -> 4667.88s]  Sir, what happened?
[4667.88s -> 4668.38s]  I don't know.
[4669.40s -> 4670.68s]  I just keep falling down.
[4671.24s -> 4675.98s]  Oh, get up.
[4675.98s -> 4677.18s]  Don't waste my time.
[4677.18s -> 4680.86s]  Do we have any idea of the suspect?
[4680.86s -> 4681.36s]  What?
[4682.98s -> 4683.62s]  Don't go in.
[4683.62s -> 4684.90s]  I'm gonna take you down.
[4695.18s -> 4696.94s]  Do you have any idea?
[4696.94s -> 4698.22s]  Oh, I gotta stop this.
[4698.86s -> 4699.42s]  What is...
[4699.42s -> 4700.30s]  Did this just happen?
[4700.86s -> 4701.90s]  Oh, I got an extra chance.
[4702.62s -> 4707.72s]  It saved it right when he came over.
[4707.72s -> 4716.87s]  Hey, you there.
[4716.87s -> 4721.03s]  You should get up now.
[4721.03s -> 4722.07s]  Any description?
[4722.07s -> 4723.27s]  What does he look like?
[4723.27s -> 4724.79s]  I don't see nothing.
[4724.79s -> 4725.29s]  Prat.
[4728.09s -> 4730.09s]  Hey, what seems to be the trouble?
[4730.09s -> 4730.97s]  Rise and shine.
[4731.93s -> 4733.21s]  Where I pee my pant.
[4733.93s -> 4734.43s]  Right?
[4750.26s -> 4751.38s]  These guys are just waiting.
[4751.38s -> 4751.94s]  They're like, you know what?
[4751.94s -> 4752.98s]  Let's just watch that guy.
[4753.62s -> 4754.74s]  See what happens to him when...
[4755.38s -> 4803.66s]  Oh, fuck.
[4803.66s -> 4804.30s]  They heard that.
[4812.50s -> 4814.02s]  What's that doing here?
[4814.02s -> 4820.08s]  Hey.
[4820.78s -> 4821.28s]  What?
[4821.94s -> 4822.44s]  That?
[4825.86s -> 4828.18s]  Why would you put it there?
[4828.18s -> 4829.38s]  He just like said it.
[4842.73s -> 4844.33s]  Yeah, I think you're fine.
[4844.33s -> 4845.29s]  Just try and get up.
[4845.85s -> 4850.63s]  Do we have a description of the suspect?
[4850.71s -> 4852.87s]  It's all a blurry mess.
[4852.87s -> 4853.37s]  It could be...
[4854.71s -> 4886.92s]  I wish I had more items.
[4887.64s -> 4888.52s]  That's the sad part.
[4888.52s -> 4890.04s]  I wish I had every kitchen item.
[4890.76s -> 4891.96s]  I would keep doing it to this guy.
[4892.60s -> 4893.10s]  Forever.
[4907.64s -> 4910.76s]  I'm gonna say that you guys might think this is not real,
[4910.76s -> 4911.64s]  but it is real.
[4913.00s -> 4914.52s]  If I was not streaming right now
[4914.52s -> 4916.92s]  and I was just playing this game silently in my bedroom,
[4918.20s -> 4920.28s]  I would do that probably for two hours.
[4920.28s -> 4921.00s]  I probably would.
[4922.55s -> 4923.75s]  I would probably keep doing this.
[4924.39s -> 4925.75s]  For like an hour and a half.
[4926.31s -> 4927.19s]  It would just be fun.
[4927.91s -> 4932.81s]  Do it now.
[4932.81s -> 4933.85s]  I can't do it now.
[4933.85s -> 4934.57s]  Like, you understand?
[4937.53s -> 4939.37s]  There are 3,000 people here watching.
[4939.37s -> 4940.65s]  If I sat there for two hours
[4940.65s -> 4942.49s]  throwing the wrench at the fucking worker,
[4945.24s -> 4947.88s]  how many people do you think would be gone in 10 minutes?
[4950.57s -> 4951.61s]  I'm gonna say half.
[4952.25s -> 4954.17s]  All right.
[4954.17s -> 4955.05s]  Infiltrate the garden.
[4958.10s -> 4960.18s]  I would definitely not gain viewers.
[4960.82s -> 4962.46s]  If I...
[4962.46s -> 4963.10s]  Oh my god.
[4963.10s -> 4964.06s]  If I did, I don't even...
[4964.06s -> 4964.54s]  That would be the...
[4965.42s -> 4966.22s]  Oops-a-daisy.
[4966.22s -> 4967.18s]  Oops-a-daisy.
[4967.18s -> 4968.22s]  Oops-a-daisy.
[4968.94s -> 4973.38s]  I have to take this guy out.
[4973.38s -> 4974.50s]  I have to, right?
[4974.50s -> 4974.90s]  I have to.
[4984.84s -> 4985.08s]  Shit.
[4985.08s -> 4986.28s]  The fucking security camera.
[4986.92s -> 4990.06s]  Did you do this?
[4990.70s -> 4991.51s]  I don't know what happened here.
[4991.51s -> 4992.79s]  Fucking look at me when I'm talking.
[4992.79s -> 5001.16s]  Stop!
[5001.16s -> 5002.44s]  Put your hands up.
[5004.36s -> 5005.08s]  Sure, projects!
[5005.80s -> 5014.07s]  Where was it?
[5014.07s -> 5019.21s]  16...
[5019.21s -> 5020.09s]  1651?
[5021.50s -> 5022.90s]  Yeah.
[5022.90s -> 5024.02s]  Whoa, hold on a second.
[5024.02s -> 5024.90s]  That's not the right one?
[5025.46s -> 5029.10s]  Yeah, that's correct.
[5029.74s -> 5042.02s]  All right, I got my stuff.
[5042.02s -> 5042.82s]  Wait, I need the hammer.
[5043.62s -> 5050.97s]  Okay, let me get over there.
[5051.61s -> 5052.73s]  I need to save the game.
[5055.82s -> 5057.02s]  Well, there it is.
[5057.66s -> 5060.30s]  So you can just walk around
[5061.02s -> 5062.95s]  until you find everything.
[5063.77s -> 5064.49s]  That's cool.
[5065.13s -> 5066.63s]  All right, get to the garden.
[5067.35s -> 5073.19s]  I'm not going to go that way.
[5073.91s -> 5075.50s]  Although, why would I have to...
[5075.50s -> 5076.46s]  I'm the gardener.
[5078.12s -> 5079.72s]  That guy can see through my disguise.
[5080.28s -> 5082.74s]  And gardening is so cool.
[5082.74s -> 5083.86s]  Say hi to your mother for me.
[5087.19s -> 5087.83s]  I'm sorry.
[5087.83s -> 5089.35s]  Um, I don't...
[5089.91s -> 5096.71s]  Okay, drop!
[5096.71s -> 5104.87s]  I've been recorded by a security camera.
[5104.87s -> 5107.27s]  I threw it into its face.
[5107.27s -> 5108.39s]  All right, what do we need to do?
[5109.62s -> 5110.10s]  I'm here.
[5112.65s -> 5116.41s]  I understand you have a mole.
[5116.41s -> 5117.53s]  You're a godsend.
[5117.53s -> 5118.49s]  Let's get straight to it.
[5119.05s -> 5120.01s]  The sooner this is fixed,
[5120.01s -> 5121.05s]  the sooner I won't have to listen
[5121.05s -> 5122.89s]  to Mr. Janus's complaints.
[5122.89s -> 5123.37s]  Follow me.
[5130.23s -> 5136.10s]  Oh, let's see if I can fix it with a bone.
[5136.74s -> 5140.90s]  As you can see, we have a mole issue.
[5140.90s -> 5141.94s]  Yeah, I do see that.
[5141.94s -> 5143.70s]  I know a permanent solution might take some time,
[5143.70s -> 5145.62s]  but you could just fill the holes
[5145.62s -> 5146.66s]  by the end of the day.
[5146.66s -> 5147.22s]  Yeah, I'll do it.
[5148.34s -> 5152.31s]  Come find me when you're done.
[5152.31s -> 5153.03s]  Okay.
[5153.03s -> 5158.07s]  I guess that's one way to go about it.
[5158.07s -> 5158.39s]  Yeah.
[5158.39s -> 5159.59s]  Well, he's a professional.
[5168.89s -> 5172.84s]  Guns are the best to block holes with.
[5173.48s -> 5181.21s]  Danny, how does it...
[5181.21s -> 5181.93s]  There's some over here.
[5181.93s -> 5182.43s]  Hold on.
[5213.02s -> 5214.70s]  You know all of his memorabilia.
[5214.70s -> 5215.58s]  You know how it works.
[5215.58s -> 5216.06s]  Interesting.
[5216.70s -> 5217.90s]  Maybe you should try to spark
[5217.90s -> 5219.74s]  some of those old stories from 2007.
[5219.74s -> 5220.06s]  What?
[5220.06s -> 5222.06s]  Who knows what secrets Janus might reveal.
[5223.02s -> 5224.38s]  Well, let me do this the right way.
[5228.94s -> 5229.26s]  I need...
[5229.26s -> 5230.94s]  I don't have the fucking explosive device.
[5231.90s -> 5238.33s]  No, I'm talking about like re...
[5238.33s -> 5240.01s]  I blew that dude up at the door
[5240.01s -> 5240.73s]  that yelled at me.
[5241.61s -> 5243.21s]  Something bad has to happen to this guy though.
[5248.12s -> 5249.96s]  Why are all these doors locked?
[5249.96s -> 5250.76s]  No, I have the key.
[5251.08s -> 5252.04s]  I'm like popping the door.
[5252.04s -> 5253.24s]  I have the key in my pocket.
[5261.06s -> 5261.38s]  Damn it.
[5268.04s -> 5268.60s]  Damn it.
[5268.60s -> 5270.12s]  I was trying to see if it could...
[5270.12s -> 5271.48s]  I was trying to see if it could go up
[5271.48s -> 5272.44s]  into the camera lens.
[5273.08s -> 5281.90s]  Say hi to your mother for me.
[5282.78s -> 5283.18s]  Yeah.
[5286.94s -> 5287.66s]  All right.
[5287.66s -> 5288.14s]  Let's go.
[5288.94s -> 5292.74s]  Block the holes.
[5293.62s -> 5299.96s]  I understand you have a mole problem.
[5299.96s -> 5301.58s]  You're a godsend.
[5301.58s -> 5302.46s]  Let's get straight to it.
[5303.02s -> 5303.98s]  The sooner this is fixed,
[5303.98s -> 5305.18s]  the sooner I won't have to listen to Mr. James.
[5305.18s -> 5306.14s]  Into the camera lens.
[5306.14s -> 5307.58s]  Yeah, like I was trying to throw it in there.
[5308.86s -> 5311.03s]  So I'm gonna have to put an explosive
[5311.03s -> 5311.59s]  in one of these.
[5312.15s -> 5313.43s]  He's gonna come out in his garden.
[5314.31s -> 5317.06s]  He's gonna lean down.
[5317.06s -> 5319.62s]  Ah, I remember picking up these radishes.
[5319.62s -> 5321.46s]  I know a permanent solution might take some time,
[5321.46s -> 5323.30s]  but if you could just fill the holes
[5323.30s -> 5325.06s]  by the end of the day, great.
[5325.06s -> 5327.03s]  Come find me when you're done.
[5327.03s -> 5331.08s]  Obtain an item to block the mole hole.
[5341.24s -> 5343.72s]  Conceal an explosive in a mole hole.
[5345.21s -> 5355.61s]  Well, I mean, block five more holes.
[5356.49s -> 5359.94s]  I gotta block...
[5359.94s -> 5361.54s]  I actually have to block all the holes.
[5365.56s -> 5365.80s]  Shit.
[5366.60s -> 5373.67s]  I don't want to get rid of the meat, though.
[5374.47s -> 5375.91s]  Is there any random shit around here?
[5382.94s -> 5383.42s]  Baseball.
[5399.54s -> 5400.50s]  Just running around the yard,
[5400.50s -> 5401.62s]  picking up random trash.
[5405.61s -> 5407.61s]  I need to find more objects.
[5409.67s -> 5410.15s]  What?
[5410.15s -> 5410.47s]  What?
[5411.19s -> 5417.10s]  I'm just gonna put the guns in them, right?
[5427.32s -> 5428.60s]  I need one more blocked.
[5429.24s -> 5433.11s]  The less guns I have, the better.
[5433.11s -> 5433.51s]  That's right.
[5434.07s -> 5435.51s]  All right.
[5435.51s -> 5435.99s]  I just need...
[5435.99s -> 5436.39s]  There it is.
[5436.39s -> 5436.71s]  Shovel.
[5437.35s -> 5439.62s]  All right.
[5439.62s -> 5440.58s]  Where's that last hole?
[5440.58s -> 5443.56s]  There's one gun in there.
[5443.56s -> 5444.36s]  That one's blocked.
[5444.92s -> 5445.80s]  This one's blocked.
[5445.80s -> 5446.60s]  This one's blocked.
[5447.40s -> 5450.71s]  One more over here, right?
[5450.71s -> 5451.27s]  Hello, sir.
[5452.17s -> 5452.81s]  Yeah, there we go.
[5455.62s -> 5456.10s]  I can't...
[5456.98s -> 5462.89s]  I want that meat.
[5466.18s -> 5466.58s]  Hold on.
[5467.22s -> 5467.94s]  There's a muffin here.
[5468.58s -> 5486.17s]  All right.
[5486.17s -> 5486.57s]  Done.
[5486.57s -> 5487.05s]  And I still...
[5487.05s -> 5487.77s]  I get to keep my meat.
[5488.41s -> 5488.89s]  That's good.
[5491.08s -> 5491.88s]  I'm done.
[5491.88s -> 5492.52s]  Great.
[5492.52s -> 5493.56s]  Let me have a quick...
[5493.56s -> 5497.70s]  Hold on.
[5497.70s -> 5499.94s]  It doesn't look in it, right?
[5500.74s -> 5504.76s]  A bit unorthodox, maybe.
[5504.76s -> 5505.96s]  But you got the job done.
[5505.96s -> 5507.16s]  That one has a gun that...
[5507.16s -> 5507.64s]  Don't open it.
[5507.64s -> 5509.72s]  I'm gonna get Mr. Janus so he can inspect it for himself.
[5509.72s -> 5510.60s]  Inspect this one?
[5513.77s -> 5515.13s]  Is he gonna inspect that one?
[5515.13s -> 5516.73s]  Mr. Janus, the molehills have been fixed.
[5519.02s -> 5519.50s]  Oh, fuck.
[5519.50s -> 5520.62s]  He's gonna pick up the guns.
[5521.93s -> 5522.33s]  All right.
[5522.89s -> 5525.85s]  Janus should be here to inspect the work soon.
[5525.85s -> 5526.33s]  Oh, no.
[5527.21s -> 5531.85s]  I'm sure this whole inspection is gonna remind Janus about something exciting from his past.
[5531.93s -> 5533.61s]  I'm sure that he's gonna tell us all about it.
[5535.37s -> 5536.49s]  Old people syndrome.
[5537.29s -> 5538.17s]  Anonymousgifter.
[5539.05s -> 5540.49s]  Better yet, keep your distance.
[5540.49s -> 5540.81s]  Thank you.
[5540.81s -> 5542.65s]  Anonymousgifter for your 10 community subs.
[5546.79s -> 5547.59s]  Thanks so much, dude.
[5548.23s -> 5554.70s]  Anonymousgifter for your 10 random subs.
[5560.04s -> 5561.88s]  Is he gonna actually inspect them?
[5562.76s -> 5564.36s]  Because if so, then I'm in trouble.
[5566.02s -> 5568.98s]  I'm afraid I'm gonna save here just in case something bad happens.
[5569.38s -> 5571.06s]  I'm gonna save, like, over here.
[5585.02s -> 5590.50s]  Janus, Cold War spymaster and the first Providence constant.
[5591.58s -> 5593.10s]  I wonder how much he remembers.
[5594.14s -> 5595.82s]  How little he cares.
[5595.82s -> 5600.30s]  Gardner took a bit of an unorthodox approach, but they do look filled to me.
[5601.18s -> 5603.50s]  I think I'll be the judge of that myself.
[5603.50s -> 5604.22s]  Thank you very much.
[5604.22s -> 5606.30s]  He is gonna check them.
[5606.30s -> 5608.98s]  Bulls, moles, moles.
[5610.02s -> 5611.54s]  Reminds me of a funny story.
[5613.06s -> 5613.94s]  Story?
[5613.94s -> 5616.50s]  The embassy in Nicaragua in 1986.
[5617.22s -> 5617.72s]  Carmen.
[5618.58s -> 5624.02s]  She had a charming mole right next to her perfectly luscious plump lips.
[5624.74s -> 5629.62s]  I discovered the mole was fake after we kissed and it got stuck on my cheek.
[5630.50s -> 5636.50s]  I kept it in a tin box to remind me of her after they sent her to the camps.
[5636.50s -> 5637.00s]  What?
[5637.78s -> 5639.14s]  He's telling the old stories?
[5639.94s -> 5645.70s]  I just keep hearing the...
[5647.70s -> 5655.43s]  Why is it the one?
[5655.43s -> 5663.94s]  Beautiful work.
[5663.94s -> 5665.94s]  The pests will soon be gone.
[5665.94s -> 5667.94s]  And then I can get back to planting my plants.
[5669.94s -> 5674.12s]  Blast reactions are the first constant to catch up with you.
[5674.12s -> 5678.87s]  Death feels like an easy way out for a man like Janus.
[5678.87s -> 5681.88s]  Still, someone's killed a lot of people.
[5681.88s -> 5683.88s]  We are close now, gentlemen.
[5683.88s -> 5689.00s]  Both targets are dead.
[5689.00s -> 5691.82s]  Calling in, calling in!
[5691.82s -> 5693.82s]  Multiple homicides on our hands.
[5693.82s -> 5695.82s]  Someone's not happy.
[5699.32s -> 5701.32s]  Anybody there? Come in!
[5701.32s -> 5703.32s]  We got some violent jackass knocking people down.
[5710.04s -> 5712.73s]  Fox struck to November Zulu, over.
[5712.73s -> 5716.73s]  We've got a certified nuisance that needs to be addressed.
[5716.73s -> 5718.73s]  Is he dead? I killed him?
[5718.73s -> 5720.73s]  I didn't kill that guy.
[5720.73s -> 5724.12s]  Wait, he's talking... I thought he was...
[5724.12s -> 5732.10s]  Silence! Stop! He's here!
[5732.10s -> 5746.18s]  I thought he was going to shoot the other guy.
[5746.18s -> 5753.67s]  That guy just backed up.
[5753.67s -> 5755.67s]  Blast reactions are the first constant to catch up with you.
[5755.67s -> 5757.67s]  Bye!
[5757.67s -> 5759.67s]  Death feels like an easy way out for a man like Janus.
[5762.17s -> 5764.17s]  Still...
[5764.17s -> 5766.17s]  We are close now, gentlemen.
[5766.17s -> 5772.95s]  Both targets are dead.
[5772.95s -> 5781.85s]  Think I'm going to let that guy get away with it?
[5781.85s -> 5783.85s]  Why? You don't remember that guy?
[5783.85s -> 5794.28s]  You guys just forget what that guy did?
[5794.28s -> 5808.49s]  I need the microfilm.
[5808.49s -> 5810.49s]  I should have got this first.
[5810.49s -> 5812.79s]  I should have got the microfilm first.
[5812.79s -> 5834.62s]  Is what I should have done.
[5834.62s -> 5849.02s]  Microfilm? Not in his bedroom?
[5849.02s -> 5851.32s]  There it is. Hidden microfilm.
[5851.32s -> 5853.32s]  One of Janus' old microfilms.
[5853.32s -> 5855.32s]  It might contain important information.
[5855.32s -> 5857.32s]  All you need now is to find a device to read it on.
[5857.32s -> 5859.32s]  We have to go into that other lady's house.
[5861.32s -> 5863.32s]  I need to be somebody else here.
[5863.32s -> 5866.58s]  I'm going to not save it right...
[5866.58s -> 5868.58s]  You!
[5868.58s -> 5885.08s]  Stop writing business here!
[5885.08s -> 5887.08s]  We are all weapons hot now.
[5887.08s -> 5893.08s]  You already did.
[5893.08s -> 5929.88s]  I already killed them both.
[5929.88s -> 5944.66s]  We're good?
[5944.66s -> 5948.17s]  Review the microfilm.
[5948.17s -> 5955.78s]  I think I can just go next door.
[5955.78s -> 5957.78s]  Wasn't the lady having a party?
[5957.78s -> 5960.22s]  Was it this house or the house next door?
[5960.22s -> 5962.22s]  Where's the barbecue?
[5962.22s -> 5966.74s]  It's one of these.
[5966.74s -> 5968.74s]  You shaved your head in a few seconds?
[5968.74s -> 5985.96s]  I got tired of it.
[5985.96s -> 5988.58s]  Vital info revealing.
[5988.58s -> 5990.58s]  I have to put the microfilm into the projector.
[5990.58s -> 5992.76s]  Wait, is this another...
[5995.77s -> 5997.77s]  I think it was the other house.
[5997.77s -> 5999.77s]  A robe for Janus?
[5999.77s -> 6001.77s]  A robe? No.
[6001.77s -> 6004.84s]  It was the other house.
[6004.84s -> 6008.49s]  I remember the lady at the party was like
[6008.49s -> 6010.49s]  Yeah, I've got this old projector upstairs.
[6010.49s -> 6012.49s]  I just don't know what to do with the darn thing.
[6012.49s -> 6015.24s]  Alright, let's go.
[6015.24s -> 6035.50s]  What?
[6035.50s -> 6045.46s]  Other side. Bye.
[6045.46s -> 6057.82s]  There's the party.
[6057.82s -> 6059.82s]  He's lost. Nah, I gotta go up there.
[6059.82s -> 6065.58s]  Because it was in this house upstairs, right?
[6065.58s -> 6068.78s]  From what I remember from the conversation
[6068.78s -> 6070.78s]  that it's the lady right there.
[6070.78s -> 6072.78s]  Thanks for keeping everything safe.
[6072.78s -> 6081.22s]  Alright, where's your projector?
[6081.22s -> 6083.22s]  That's a pretty...
[6083.22s -> 6087.45s]  Who is this guy? Don't know, me?
[6087.45s -> 6090.78s]  Bob Ross.
[6090.78s -> 6092.78s]  You can't badmouth him, Al.
[6092.78s -> 6094.78s]  Shame on you.
[6094.78s -> 6096.78s]  Bob Ross painted this?
[6096.78s -> 6098.78s]  But seriously, what's the deal with all this stuff?
[6098.78s -> 6100.78s]  You don't think?
[6100.78s -> 6102.78s]  Maybe that's how they're making all their money.
[6102.78s -> 6104.78s]  Nobody ever got rich by cashing in
[6104.78s -> 6106.78s]  on their fine arts degree, Al.
[6106.78s -> 6108.78s]  You know that.
[6108.78s -> 6110.78s]  Unless they create forgeries.
[6110.78s -> 6112.78s]  I saw a documentary about
[6112.78s -> 6114.78s]  Chinese forgery factories.
[6114.78s -> 6116.78s]  They were literally spitting out fakes
[6116.78s -> 6118.78s]  left and right at millions.
[6118.78s -> 6120.78s]  And this, this sort of looks like
[6120.78s -> 6122.78s]  Pollock's number five, doesn't it?
[6122.78s -> 6124.78s]  No, Al. No, it doesn't.
[6124.78s -> 6127.14s]  Let's move on.
[6127.14s -> 6131.88s]  Move on, Jay.
[6131.88s -> 6134.82s]  Alright, looking for the projector.
[6134.82s -> 6137.45s]  Alright, no.
[6137.45s -> 6139.75s]  Who the fuck is in here?
[6139.75s -> 6144.55s]  Who's this person?
[6144.55s -> 6151.21s]  Did I do that?
[6151.21s -> 6159.21s]  I didn't do that, did I?
[6159.21s -> 6165.74s]  Was I here?
[6165.74s -> 6171.18s]  Did I hurt people up here?
[6171.18s -> 6178.15s]  Wilson's house key.
[6178.15s -> 6181.67s]  Okay.
[6181.67s -> 6183.67s]  Baseball. Baseball bat.
[6183.67s -> 6185.67s]  It's oversized, too.
[6185.67s -> 6188.42s]  TV.
[6188.42s -> 6194.55s]  Not a projector.
[6194.55s -> 6196.55s]  Reveal the microphone.
[6196.55s -> 6199.62s]  Is it upstairs?
[6199.62s -> 6201.62s]  Or is it downstairs?
[6201.62s -> 6205.34s]  I'm like right over it.
[6205.34s -> 6214.15s]  It's like right here.
[6228.10s -> 6230.10s]  Don't, don't save it first
[6230.10s -> 6236.38s]  if you're gonna, Jesus.
[6236.38s -> 6268.18s]  And just like that, we're gonna subvert your expectations.
[6307.40s -> 6309.40s]  Agent 47 doing the crab walk.
[6309.40s -> 6328.66s]  I gotta get, I gotta get away from here.
[6328.66s -> 6340.95s]  Get away.
[6340.95s -> 6344.90s]  No. Upstairs.
[6344.90s -> 6352.14s]  Where is the attic? Attic button.
[6352.14s -> 6354.14s]  Nope. That's not an attic pulley thing.
[6354.14s -> 6358.30s]  How do I get up to the attic?
[6358.30s -> 6366.17s]  Do I have to go like on the roof or something?
[6366.17s -> 6368.17s]  Cause I don't see any more stairs.
[6368.17s -> 6373.10s]  Over here? Attic button.
[6373.10s -> 6380.01s]  Just in case I need it up there, you know?
[6380.01s -> 6384.81s]  My game. Every time I open like a new door.
[6384.81s -> 6411.10s]  Let's take a look.
[6423.10s -> 6427.10s]  How do I get out of here?
[6431.10s -> 6444.15s]  They're both dead.
[6444.15s -> 6446.71s]  Locate his robe.
[6446.71s -> 6459.83s]  Why do I need to locate his robe?
[6459.83s -> 6472.06s]  I need to look at it more?
[6472.06s -> 6474.68s]  I think I got all the dialogue out of there.
[6488.76s -> 6510.38s]  I'm killing so many cars right now.
[6510.38s -> 6572.95s]  Why would you go?
[6572.95s -> 6574.95s]  I just wanna throw baseball at somebody out the window.
[6574.95s -> 6587.37s]  That's all I wanna do.
[6592.36s -> 6594.36s]  There's a heart and a terminal out there.
[6594.36s -> 6597.05s]  They need to apprehend him.
[6597.05s -> 6601.26s]  Alright.
[6601.26s -> 6603.26s]  Security, I need some help.
[6603.26s -> 6605.56s]  Jesus!
[6605.56s -> 6609.59s]  Food up. Copy.
[6609.59s -> 6631.66s]  Stop running, come on.
[6631.66s -> 6633.66s]  Oh no! No, wait!
[6633.66s -> 6635.90s]  Wait! No! Oh god.
[6635.90s -> 6643.13s]  I have to. I got it.
[6643.13s -> 6653.35s]  They went through.
[6653.35s -> 6656.68s]  So, how come I can't leave?
[6656.68s -> 6660.68s]  Do I actually need to like go to this guy's house and put on his robe?
[6660.68s -> 6667.02s]  I need to find the robe.
[6667.02s -> 6670.77s]  So this is not just as simple as kill the two guys.
[6670.77s -> 6674.35s]  Alright.
[6674.35s -> 6676.85s]  Locate the robe.
[6676.85s -> 6685.49s]  I was supposed to find...
[6685.49s -> 6692.46s]  His house is like empty.
[6696.77s -> 6698.77s]  No! I got on the roof!
[6698.77s -> 6700.77s]  Mom, I'm not gonna be able to get it back.
[6700.77s -> 6706.08s]  Well, you throw it up there.
[6706.08s -> 6709.92s]  It's staying up there.
[6725.63s -> 6727.63s]  I really have to go and like do all this right now.
[6727.63s -> 6731.54s]  I thought I was done.
[6741.72s -> 6744.34s]  Damn it, man.
[6751.13s -> 6753.62s]  Who the fuck is shooting at me?
[6753.62s -> 6761.50s]  The guy's just shooting through the wall.
[6770.58s -> 6773.27s]  Alright. Where's the microfilm?
[6773.27s -> 6775.27s]  Not the microfilm!
[6775.27s -> 6777.27s]  Where's the...
[6777.27s -> 6779.96s]  Where's the robe?
[6779.96s -> 6784.38s]  I'm getting like a time loop.
[6784.38s -> 6786.38s]  Locate the robe.
[6786.38s -> 6791.50s]  That's over here.
[6791.50s -> 6795.59s]  Hold on a second.
[6795.59s -> 6797.59s]  Why did they tell me to do that?
[6797.59s -> 6814.28s]  When they're like down here.
[6814.28s -> 6816.28s]  Am I still on this mission?
[6816.28s -> 6818.28s]  Yeah, because apparently I did it and I already did them.
[6818.28s -> 6827.88s]  They're already dead.
[6827.88s -> 6829.88s]  I'm trespassing over here now.
[6829.88s -> 6849.78s]  God damn it.
[6849.78s -> 6853.18s]  I'm found trespassing right now.
[6853.18s -> 6855.18s]  Where do I need to go?
[6855.18s -> 6857.18s]  I need to go to like the other place next door.
[6857.18s -> 6859.61s]  Or objective clue reveal.
[6859.61s -> 6871.06s]  I'm just going to load the save.
[6871.06s -> 6878.30s]  It's going to go from...
[6878.30s -> 6880.30s]  Let's go from here.
[6880.30s -> 6886.31s]  Is he still trying to throw a brick?
[6886.31s -> 6888.31s]  Wait a minute.
[6888.31s -> 6890.31s]  Let me read the intel to see why I can't leave.
[6890.31s -> 6898.38s]  So I need to...
[6898.38s -> 6903.82s]  I need to do this.
[6903.82s -> 6905.82s]  So that's the meeting point, right?
[6905.82s -> 6907.82s]  Didn't I already do this?
[6907.82s -> 6913.64s]  Like didn't I already reveal the meeting point?
[6913.64s -> 6915.64s]  And that's just where I need to go.
[6915.64s -> 6924.28s]  So constant meeting confirmed.
[6924.28s -> 6928.89s]  That's what I needed, right?
[6928.89s -> 6930.89s]  Confirm an existing connection between the constant
[6930.89s -> 6932.89s]  and reveal a date they would meet.
[6932.89s -> 6934.89s]  So it's like in his robe somewhere.
[6934.89s -> 6939.42s]  Alright.
[6939.42s -> 6941.42s]  This is the first mission that they've done where I've had to actually
[6941.42s -> 6943.42s]  complete like the clue parts.
[6943.42s -> 6945.42s]  It was just do the mission, kill the guy, and leave.
[6945.42s -> 6950.60s]  So I'm going to go
[6950.60s -> 6956.10s]  over here.
[6956.10s -> 6959.69s]  I'm going to go back to the Cassidy property.
[6959.69s -> 6967.18s]  Hopefully nobody freaks out about this.
[6967.18s -> 6969.18s]  Can I like jump down from here?
[6969.18s -> 6972.12s]  Come on. I can't just jump down from here.
[6972.12s -> 6978.70s]  Alright. Well, whatever.
[6978.70s -> 6987.08s]  Walk out the front door.
[6987.08s -> 6992.97s]  Perfectly normal, but throwing
[6992.97s -> 6994.97s]  baseballs is illegal.
[6994.97s -> 6997.96s]  Alright.
[6997.96s -> 6999.96s]  So it's just this house right here.
[6999.96s -> 7001.96s]  I'm not allowed to be in here, but
[7001.96s -> 7003.96s]  I'm going to find the meeting point.
[7003.96s -> 7006.84s]  Don't load it. Save it.
[7006.84s -> 7012.28s]  That's a clue reveal I'm going to.
[7012.28s -> 7015.67s]  Don't I have to do it all?
[7015.67s -> 7017.67s]  Or do I just have to go get the robe?
[7017.67s -> 7022.09s]  Is that the only thing I have to do?
[7022.09s -> 7028.74s]  Just get the robe.
[7028.74s -> 7030.74s]  You have to do them both.
[7030.74s -> 7034.84s]  Well, I'm right here. I'm going to do it.
[7034.84s -> 7044.12s]  I'm currently trespassing again.
[7044.12s -> 7048.28s]  I'm going to save it right here.
[7048.28s -> 7053.02s]  Just find it.
[7053.02s -> 7055.02s]  I thought
[7055.02s -> 7057.02s]  whatever.
[7057.02s -> 7061.88s]  Golf.
[7061.88s -> 7082.09s]  Okay.
[7082.09s -> 7088.62s]  He's upstairs. Apparently whoever
[7088.62s -> 7090.62s]  it is is up there.
[7090.62s -> 7098.74s]  Okay. Let's go stare at him.
[7098.74s -> 7108.33s]  Hello. Hi.
[7108.33s -> 7116.97s]  Alright. Found the meeting point.
[7116.97s -> 7120.87s]  Tactical bathroom.
[7125.30s -> 7127.30s]  No.
[7127.30s -> 7129.30s]  No.
[7137.91s -> 7139.91s]  I don't know where he went.
[7139.91s -> 7141.91s]  He was somewhere. Tactical.
[7141.91s -> 7145.75s]  So I don't have the clue now.
[7145.75s -> 7152.46s]  Now I have to go.
[7152.46s -> 7155.02s]  Alright. So
[7155.02s -> 7157.02s]  was that guy supposed to have a conversation?
[7157.02s -> 7180.63s]  Because now I have to go over here.
[7180.63s -> 7184.22s]  Okay. Let's go get the robe.
[7184.22s -> 7187.93s]  I can't save it yet.
[7187.93s -> 7190.62s]  So the robe is now.
[7190.62s -> 7195.80s]  Okay. Straight ahead.
[7195.80s -> 7203.66s]  The robe.
[7203.66s -> 7205.66s]  Hi.
[7205.66s -> 7209.69s]  Well, I would have done this first.
[7209.69s -> 7212.12s]  I didn't know I had
[7212.12s -> 7214.36s]  to do all this.
[7214.36s -> 7216.36s]  I guess here.
[7216.36s -> 7218.36s]  When it says eliminate, eliminate. Oh.
[7218.36s -> 7220.36s]  So you have to do this too.
[7220.36s -> 7222.36s]  I just pressed the button.
[7222.36s -> 7225.69s]  Let's go. I would have done this all
[7225.69s -> 7229.40s]  in reverse.
[7229.40s -> 7232.34s]  So I need to. I don't want to like pop that
[7232.34s -> 7234.34s]  in front of everybody. But I think I have to.
[7234.34s -> 7244.97s]  Hey. What if I happen to. I get to do what I want
[7244.97s -> 7251.62s]  in Hitman. What happened to that?
[7251.62s -> 7253.62s]  I have to go find these clues?
[7253.62s -> 7255.62s]  No. Just stuff them in the guy's pocket.
[7255.62s -> 7265.80s]  He should have a map to
[7265.80s -> 7267.80s]  Oh. The guy should have a map up his ass.
[7267.80s -> 7273.18s]  I'll have his fucking shotgun.
[7273.18s -> 7328.97s]  The robe is upstairs.
[7328.97s -> 7343.05s]  Why do I keep having the door?
[7343.05s -> 7349.32s]  Okay. Give me the bathrobe.
[7349.32s -> 7354.18s]  A ceremonial robe of some sort
[7354.18s -> 7356.18s]  with a note from Janus attached.
[7356.18s -> 7359.83s]  The note is interesting.
[7359.83s -> 7362.07s]  Janus has asked Helen
[7362.07s -> 7364.07s]  to do a few repairs on the robe before he leaves
[7364.07s -> 7366.07s]  for his annual trip.
[7366.07s -> 7368.07s]  He even put a date there.
[7368.07s -> 7370.07s]  This is valuable information, 47.
[7370.07s -> 7375.32s]  So I just had to pick up the robe.
[7375.32s -> 7397.98s]  That's all I had to do.
[7397.98s -> 7399.98s]  The shotgun? I'll be fine.
[7399.98s -> 7408.55s]  That's Gandalf cosplay.
[7408.55s -> 7414.38s]  What's really facing?
[7414.38s -> 7421.59s]  Who saw me here?
[7421.59s -> 7423.59s]  I don't know what he's reading.
[7423.59s -> 7425.59s]  But it looks like it's the most
[7425.59s -> 7427.59s]  interesting thing he's ever come across.
[7427.59s -> 7429.59s]  The new Cassandra Snow novel.
[7429.59s -> 7431.59s]  What do you have to do with this?
[7431.59s -> 7433.59s]  What do you have to do with this?
[7433.59s -> 7435.59s]  You're just on a jog.
[7435.59s -> 7437.77s]  You're on a jog.
[7437.77s -> 7439.77s]  Why would you be like one of the sentries
[7439.77s -> 7441.77s]  that can see through my disguise?
[7452.89s -> 7456.86s]  Oh. It's the fucking shotgun.
[7456.86s -> 7458.86s]  I'll be fine, guys.
[7458.86s -> 7475.11s]  Alright. Let's go.
[7475.11s -> 7496.04s]  Shotgun, whether it sounds like it's something I want to play
[7496.04s -> 7498.04s]  in Dungeons & Dragons.
[7516.20s -> 7518.20s]  Out of my face.
[7532.76s -> 7542.17s]  Alright.
[7542.17s -> 7549.91s]  Who the fuck is this?
[7549.91s -> 7553.11s]  Is this guy reading Janus's diary?
[7557.59s -> 7559.59s]  Is that his diary?
[7559.59s -> 7562.41s]  He's got all kinds of math problems in there.
[7562.41s -> 7581.74s]  Alright, give me that diary.
[7581.74s -> 7594.47s]  It's in a weird spot.
[7598.47s -> 7600.47s]  Can I just leave?
[7608.47s -> 7610.47s]  We now know Janus is meeting
[7610.47s -> 7612.47s]  with the Constant at an event related
[7612.47s -> 7614.47s]  to the Ark Society.
[7614.47s -> 7616.47s]  And we have an approximate date as well.
[7616.47s -> 7618.47s]  I think that's all we're going to get.
[7618.47s -> 7620.47s]  We're close to the finish line.
[7620.47s -> 7622.47s]  It's time to end this.
[7622.47s -> 7624.47s]  Yeah.
[7624.47s -> 7626.47s]  Mission objectives are completed.
[7626.47s -> 7628.47s]  47, once you've left Wittleton Creek
[7628.47s -> 7630.47s]  I will notify Providence of our
[7630.47s -> 7632.47s]  discovery.
[7632.47s -> 7634.47s]  In the meantime, we'll go over the clues
[7634.47s -> 7636.47s]  you've found.
[7636.47s -> 7638.47s]  Once we've located the Constant,
[7638.47s -> 7640.47s]  we'll make our final move.
[7649.82s -> 7651.82s]  Let's go!
[7651.82s -> 7671.77s]  See you later, sucker!
[7671.77s -> 7673.77s]  Past, the present, breaking news.
[7673.77s -> 7681.90s]  Wear the robe.
[7681.90s -> 7685.10s]  I feel like that's what Chad has been saying
[7685.10s -> 7687.10s]  for the last 30 straight minutes.
[7687.10s -> 7699.50s]  Zero stars, here it comes.
[7699.50s -> 7701.50s]  Well, you can't get stars if you
[7701.50s -> 7704.18s]  throw fire extinguishers
[7704.18s -> 7706.18s]  at people at some point for the mission.
[7706.18s -> 7708.18s]  Like, I just, I can't, that's how I like to play.
[7708.18s -> 7712.86s]  In one hour, the last mission
[7712.86s -> 7714.86s]  took an hour. The mission before that took
[7714.86s -> 7727.78s]  an hour. To get five stars
[7727.78s -> 7729.78s]  I would have to just sneak around,
[7729.78s -> 7732.66s]  do everything by the book.
[7732.66s -> 7734.66s]  You wouldn't get to see a baseball
[7734.66s -> 7736.66s]  get thrown, because I wouldn't be able to do that.
[7736.66s -> 7744.41s]  I got an auto-MK2.
[7744.41s -> 7751.96s]  I did, I got like halfway
[7751.96s -> 7766.62s]  into trying this one.
[7766.62s -> 7768.62s]  The Ark Society.
[7768.62s -> 7770.62s]  One of Providence's more
[7770.62s -> 7772.62s]  obscure outfits.
[7772.62s -> 7774.62s]  I've heard whispers.
[7774.62s -> 7776.62s]  A survivalist club for the global
[7776.62s -> 7778.62s]  elite. Billionaires preparing
[7778.62s -> 7780.62s]  for a global collapse.
[7780.62s -> 7782.62s]  And now we know the constant will attend their next
[7782.62s -> 7784.62s]  gathering. So where is it?
[7784.62s -> 7786.62s]  That's the catch.
[7786.62s -> 7788.62s]  The report is redacted.
[7788.62s -> 7790.62s]  No names, no location.
[7790.62s -> 7792.62s]  So it's a dead end.
[7792.62s -> 7794.62s]  I can't track them, not without ICA
[7794.62s -> 7796.62s]  backup.
[7796.62s -> 7798.62s]  Now, I'm no big shot
[7798.62s -> 7800.62s]  analyst, but
[7800.62s -> 7802.62s]  there are two missions left.
[7837.94s -> 7840.57s]  So we've got a split personality here.
[7840.57s -> 7842.57s]  He's like inside of my head.
[7842.57s -> 7845.06s]  Wow.
[7845.06s -> 7847.06s]  Same person.
[7875.02s -> 7877.02s]  I don't have a problem with this.
[7877.02s -> 7881.37s]  I mean, they're short anyways.
[7881.37s -> 7883.37s]  It's not like they're big, elaborate cutscenes.
[7883.37s -> 7885.37s]  They just are there in between.
[7885.37s -> 7890.87s]  The Ark Society.
[7925.64s -> 7927.64s]  That animal is twice as dangerous.
[7927.64s -> 7929.64s]  Let's be perfectly clear.
[7929.64s -> 7931.64s]  We were not
[7931.64s -> 7933.64s]  exposed. The threat
[7933.64s -> 7935.64s]  is neutralized.
[7935.64s -> 7937.64s]  We are back on track.
[7937.64s -> 7939.64s]  Even so, from this
[7939.64s -> 7941.64s]  point on, we expect you to take...
[7941.64s -> 7943.64s]  No. There is no way I'm
[7943.64s -> 7946.20s]  doing that. Question my
[7946.20s -> 7948.20s]  loyalty. In case treachery
[7948.20s -> 7950.20s]  is contagious.
[7950.20s -> 7952.20s]  Do you really want to
[7952.20s -> 7954.20s]  do this to me?
[7954.20s -> 7957.59s]  Is there a problem, secretary?
[7957.59s -> 7963.10s]  No
[7963.10s -> 7965.10s]  problem whatsoever,
[7965.10s -> 7967.10s]  madam.
[7967.10s -> 7972.90s]  What? Was this a VR game?
[7972.90s -> 7976.62s]  Apparently that's all that was.
[7976.62s -> 7986.98s]  Here's
[7986.98s -> 7988.98s]  to loyalty.
[7988.98s -> 8004.86s]  It's that the constant has arrived.
[8004.86s -> 8006.86s]  We had outed somehow.
[8006.86s -> 8008.86s]  Classic Syringo.
[8008.86s -> 8010.86s]  In case the crew get ideas.
[8010.86s -> 8013.16s]  Why are you doing
[8013.16s -> 8015.16s]  this, Mr. Gray? You had a chance
[8015.16s -> 8017.16s]  to walk away. Why didn't you?
[8017.16s -> 8021.00s]  A year ago
[8021.00s -> 8023.00s]  I'm working security
[8023.00s -> 8025.00s]  for this banker, Cobb.
[8025.00s -> 8027.00s]  Only to find out he's
[8027.00s -> 8029.00s]  a Providence operative.
[8029.00s -> 8031.50s]  I've been running for decades
[8031.50s -> 8033.50s]  only to wind up where I started.
[8033.50s -> 8035.50s]  We've all got
[8035.50s -> 8037.50s]  barcodes on the back of our heads.
[8037.50s -> 8039.50s]  Most people just never notice.
[8039.50s -> 8044.42s]  47 told me about
[8044.42s -> 8046.86s]  your parents. How did
[8046.86s -> 8050.89s]  they die? Car bomb.
[8050.89s -> 8052.89s]  Sorry, 1989.
[8052.89s -> 8054.89s]  Company named Blue Seed
[8054.89s -> 8056.89s]  didn't care to pay for the mistakes.
[8056.89s -> 8058.89s]  But I like to think
[8058.89s -> 8060.89s]  no one's
[8060.89s -> 8065.56s]  untouchable.
[8065.56s -> 8067.56s]  I'm sorry for your loss.
[8067.56s -> 8069.56s]  You feel it.
[8069.56s -> 8071.80s]  Unlike him, you feel it all.
[8071.80s -> 8073.80s]  Everything you've done.
[8073.80s -> 8078.47s]  It's a dangerous thing.
[8080.97s -> 8082.97s]  Having a conscience.
[8082.97s -> 8085.53s]  I was gonna make a Star Wars joke,
[8085.53s -> 8087.53s]  but I'm gonna let you guys do it.
[8087.53s -> 8090.15s]  If I make the Star Wars joke, everyone's gonna
[8090.15s -> 8095.53s]  fucking scream at me.
[8095.53s -> 8097.53s]  If I leaned in the mic right there and I was like, you failed too.
[8097.53s -> 8100.34s]  I would've seen minus two's
[8100.34s -> 8106.68s]  the whole time.
[8106.68s -> 8109.37s]  So, here's the Ark Society.
[8109.37s -> 8111.86s]  Attention, gentlemen.
[8111.86s -> 8113.86s]  Our source on the island
[8113.86s -> 8115.86s]  just made a critical discovery.
[8115.86s -> 8117.86s]  The Constant has a poison chip
[8117.86s -> 8119.86s]  embedded in his neck.
[8119.86s -> 8121.86s]  A failsafe, in case he's compromised.
[8121.86s -> 8123.86s]  He can't die.
[8123.86s -> 8125.86s]  Keep him alive.
[8127.86s -> 8129.86s]  Just feed him Red Bulls.
[8153.86s -> 8155.86s]  I figure out a way to get the Constant off the island.
[8155.86s -> 8157.86s]  It'll be tight.
[8157.86s -> 8159.86s]  But once we're back at the ship, we should be able to surgically remove
[8159.86s -> 8161.86s]  the chip before the partners have time to react.
[8161.86s -> 8163.86s]  But I'm sorry, I wasn't paying attention.
[8163.86s -> 8165.86s]  I have my headphones in.
[8165.86s -> 8168.30s]  Zoe and Sophia's father
[8168.30s -> 8170.30s]  is president of a powerful conservative
[8170.30s -> 8172.30s]  think tank. One of Providence's
[8172.30s -> 8174.30s]  prime assets.
[8174.30s -> 8176.60s]  The apples don't fall far
[8176.60s -> 8178.60s]  from the tree.
[8178.60s -> 8180.60s]  No saints either. According to ICA files,
[8180.60s -> 8182.60s]  the twins are pampered socialites
[8182.60s -> 8184.60s]  who get their kicks from treasure hunting.
[8184.60s -> 8186.60s]  Commanding a band of trigger-happy
[8186.60s -> 8188.60s]  mercenaries, Zoe and Sophia
[8188.60s -> 8190.60s]  prowl the world in search for ancient
[8190.60s -> 8192.60s]  relics. With little regard for
[8192.60s -> 8194.60s]  local culture, or even human life,
[8194.60s -> 8196.60s]  they stop at nothing to claim
[8196.60s -> 8198.60s]  their primes. Well,
[8198.60s -> 8200.60s]  collateral damage they may be,
[8200.60s -> 8202.60s]  but safe to say, they have coming.
[8202.60s -> 8204.60s]  So, kill them both.
[8204.60s -> 8212.26s]  Alright. Hold on a minute.
[8212.26s -> 8214.26s]  Let me make sure, okay.
[8214.26s -> 8216.26s]  Zoe, Washington.
[8216.26s -> 8218.26s]  Any disguise, any method.
[8218.26s -> 8220.26s]  Any disguise, any method.
[8220.26s -> 8222.44s]  Do not
[8222.44s -> 8224.44s]  eliminate the constant.
[8224.44s -> 8226.62s]  Do not kill this person.
[8226.62s -> 8229.30s]  That's it. There's no
[8229.30s -> 8231.30s]  clues, or fine clues.
[8231.30s -> 8233.30s]  Just don't kill him, kill them.
[8233.30s -> 8242.46s]  Okay.
[8242.46s -> 8246.81s]  Planning. Take the silver ballers.
[8246.81s -> 8248.81s]  Yep. I'll wear my...
[8248.81s -> 8251.05s]  That's not a really good
[8251.05s -> 8253.22s]  costume. Why wouldn't I put on
[8253.22s -> 8255.22s]  a wig? Me putting a wig
[8255.22s -> 8257.22s]  on is more effective than me covering
[8257.22s -> 8269.96s]  my eyes and nose.
[8269.96s -> 8272.20s]  What's he got?
[8272.20s -> 8274.20s]  Proximity.
[8274.20s -> 8277.08s]  Breed case. I'm gonna
[8277.08s -> 8279.08s]  travel breed case. I keep the lockpick
[8279.08s -> 8284.52s]  and the fish. Wear the
[8284.52s -> 8288.49s]  robe. I don't have
[8288.49s -> 8291.94s]  the robe. I don't have
[8291.94s -> 8293.94s]  the robe. Alright, ready?
[8293.94s -> 8310.57s]  Let's go.
[8310.57s -> 8312.57s]  47 was the channel for Nickelodeon in my
[8312.57s -> 8314.57s]  grandma's house when I was a kid.
[8314.57s -> 8318.73s]  What?
[8318.73s -> 8320.73s]  Alright.
[8322.73s -> 8326.06s]  Same, same.
[8326.06s -> 8328.06s]  Was it?
[8328.06s -> 8330.06s]  I don't know what it was for mine.
[8342.36s -> 8344.54s]  I feel like it was somewhere in the Twins.
[8348.54s -> 8352.12s]  Okay.
[8368.12s -> 8370.12s]  This is an interesting castle.
[8376.12s -> 8381.05s]  This is just the first part of
[8381.05s -> 8383.05s]  Bioshock Infinite.
[8383.05s -> 8385.22s]  Don't kill the constant.
[8385.22s -> 8398.58s]  Alright.
[8398.58s -> 8400.95s]  Hold on, one second. I need to look at this.
[8400.95s -> 8403.96s]  Uh...
[8403.96s -> 8405.96s]  What is this?
[8405.96s -> 8410.50s]  Oh, nope. Nevermind, I'm good.
[8410.50s -> 8412.50s]  Alright. So...
[8412.50s -> 8414.50s]  Eliminate the
[8414.50s -> 8416.50s]  Zoe Washington, Sophia Washington, the both over there.
[8416.50s -> 8418.50s]  Don't kill that guy who's trapped
[8418.50s -> 8420.50s]  in what seems to be a
[8420.50s -> 8423.38s]  bubble.
[8423.38s -> 8425.38s]  Yes.
[8427.38s -> 8429.38s]  Alright.
[8452.90s -> 8454.90s]  We're gonna get a tour?
[8454.90s -> 8456.90s]  Alright. But, what's that
[8456.90s -> 8458.90s]  though?
[8458.90s -> 8460.90s]  No, let's do the tour. That's what I want to do.
[8462.90s -> 8467.64s]  He just said epic, he did it.
[8467.64s -> 8472.38s]  This place is epic.
[8472.38s -> 8479.10s]  Some people are saying you need to take
[8479.10s -> 8481.98s]  his robe. All in due
[8481.98s -> 8483.98s]  time, guys. It's all in due time.
[8483.98s -> 8488.58s]  My god. I don't know why
[8488.58s -> 8490.58s]  every time I load another area, I just
[8490.58s -> 8492.76s]  mmmmgggg.
[8500.76s -> 8502.76s]  Why didn't he do anything?
[8502.76s -> 8504.76s]  He's getting
[8504.76s -> 8506.76s]  closer to me.
[8515.32s -> 8533.43s]  Good to see you, friend.
[8533.43s -> 8537.59s]  Good to see you too.
[8537.59s -> 8540.22s]  By the way, do you need to
[8540.22s -> 8542.65s]  pee or anything?
[8542.65s -> 8558.12s]  Just curious.
[8558.12s -> 8560.12s]  It's hard to do 47's voice.
[8560.12s -> 8562.12s]  There's nobody... Ah, there are people over here.
[8562.12s -> 8565.13s]  Yes, hello.
[8565.13s -> 8568.39s]  Hello, hello.
[8568.39s -> 8572.42s]  Hey, look, a guy on a piano!
[8572.42s -> 8592.26s]  Now, so by the way, I just
[8592.26s -> 8594.26s]  reduced my score by two stars, I think.
[8594.26s -> 8602.52s]  Okay, so it's a party.
[8608.52s -> 8610.52s]  Should I get a drink?
[8610.52s -> 8612.52s]  We got sushi.
[8614.52s -> 8622.25s]  Popcorn.
[8622.25s -> 8624.25s]  Popcorn.
[8626.25s -> 8639.94s]  This drink isn't even... There he is.
[8639.94s -> 8646.47s]  I just took a sip out of somebody
[8646.47s -> 8648.47s]  else's wine and put it back down.
[8648.47s -> 8652.31s]  Where's he going?
[8652.31s -> 8654.31s]  Is he going up to the...
[8654.31s -> 8656.31s]  This is definitely off limits, right?
[8656.31s -> 8658.31s]  I mean, there's a blood-borne cage
[8658.31s -> 8661.32s]  over there. Where's he going?
[8661.32s -> 8665.16s]  Is he going to make an announcement
[8665.16s -> 8667.16s]  or something?
[8667.16s -> 8671.90s]  Let's explore.
[8671.90s -> 8673.90s]  Now, he is going to make an
[8673.90s -> 8675.90s]  announcement.
[8693.61s -> 8695.61s]  I think I'm just going to be with
[8695.61s -> 8697.61s]  the party.
[8697.61s -> 8699.61s]  Okay, everyone's going to go
[8699.61s -> 8701.61s]  to the upper courtyard.
[8706.92s -> 8712.42s]  Does nobody else care about this? Why are only like three people
[8712.42s -> 8720.42s]  going? Off limits?
[8720.42s -> 8722.42s]  Is this off limits? Off limits.
[8722.42s -> 8726.39s]  Are we off limits?
[8728.39s -> 8738.70s]  No, I got to keep up with the group.
[8738.70s -> 8740.70s]  That thing's going to slide.
[8740.70s -> 8755.16s]  Initiation door.
[8755.16s -> 8757.16s]  A locked door leads to the castle basement with it.
[8757.16s -> 8759.16s]  Initiation interview with Zoe
[8759.16s -> 8761.16s]  Washington will take place, but to gain
[8761.16s -> 8763.16s]  admittance, initiates need to collect a number of tokens.
[8763.16s -> 8771.16s]  So,
[8771.16s -> 8773.59s]  to get through to
[8773.59s -> 8778.78s]  Munchkinland, I need tokens.
[8778.78s -> 8781.91s]  This is cool.
[8785.18s -> 8795.67s]  What the hell is this?
[8795.67s -> 8797.67s]  Then the Olympics can now
[8797.67s -> 8811.05s]  begin.
[8811.05s -> 8813.29s]  I'm going to get the gold medal.
[8813.29s -> 8815.53s]  Come on, I got to win the gold medal.
[8815.53s -> 8833.26s]  For swinging at people.
[8833.26s -> 8837.86s]  Is this money?
[8837.86s -> 8841.06s]  You throw
[8841.06s -> 8843.06s]  like a thousand dollars in there?
[8843.06s -> 8855.35s]  What's this actual ceremony?
[8855.35s -> 8858.42s]  It's the Star Citizen
[8858.42s -> 8860.42s]  Kickstarter.
[8860.42s -> 8864.50s]  What?
[8864.50s -> 8866.50s]  Oh, God.
[8866.50s -> 8873.22s]  Alright, it's my turn.
[8873.22s -> 8877.19s]  I don't have any money.
[8877.19s -> 8884.81s]  Was this like Ebenezer
[8884.81s -> 8889.54s]  Scrooge?
[8889.54s -> 8891.54s]  He's about to see the growth of Christmas present.
[8897.54s -> 8899.54s]  Wait, what's this?
[8912.36s -> 8914.36s]  Oh, no.
[8928.38s -> 8930.62s]  Okay.
[8930.62s -> 8932.62s]  Well, the Phoenix
[8932.62s -> 8936.01s]  effigy. Burning effigy
[8936.01s -> 8938.01s]  sounds like an accident waiting to happen.
[8938.01s -> 8951.37s]  Let's save it here.
[8951.37s -> 8953.37s]  Somebody mentioned I do have coins.
[8953.37s -> 8957.08s]  No, I have a fish.
[8957.08s -> 8959.08s]  I don't have very much money.
[8959.08s -> 8961.64s]  But will I come from
[8961.64s -> 8964.26s]  this is worth
[8964.26s -> 8966.26s]  gold?
[8966.26s -> 8970.49s]  Thank you.
[8970.49s -> 8975.14s]  I want it back.
[8975.14s -> 8983.90s]  I want it back.
[8983.90s -> 8987.67s]  Alright, let's go.
[8987.67s -> 8989.67s]  Escape.
[8989.67s -> 8992.87s]  Locate the escape door hydraulics.
[8992.87s -> 8994.87s]  I'm definitely not allowed back here.
[8999.56s -> 9003.08s]  Tokens.
[9003.08s -> 9009.29s]  How many do I need? Can I give this guy a token?
[9009.29s -> 9017.29s]  I want to be like the rich asshole
[9017.29s -> 9019.29s]  that's all the way in the back.
[9019.29s -> 9021.29s]  That doesn't give a shit.
[9021.29s -> 9023.29s]  Everyone's throwing cash up there. They want all the claps.
[9023.29s -> 9025.29s]  I'm the guy at the auction.
[9025.29s -> 9027.29s]  That just raises
[9027.29s -> 9029.29s]  up like 50 million dollars. He doesn't
[9029.29s -> 9031.29s]  want any fanfare.
[9031.29s -> 9033.29s]  Who cares? There's 20 million.
[9052.17s -> 9056.65s]  I need that coin.
[9060.65s -> 9065.32s]  I think your fish is done.
[9071.38s -> 9073.38s]  This is a secret elevator.
[9076.78s -> 9079.46s]  How do I get out of this?
[9079.46s -> 9086.38s]  How do I go down?
[9112.82s -> 9117.18s]  Hey, close that.
[9117.18s -> 9120.18s]  Jesse Pinkman.
[9120.18s -> 9128.87s]  Alright, I still have that coin, right?
[9128.87s -> 9133.22s]  No. I still have the fish.
[9133.22s -> 9135.40s]  Alright, we went back to when I had the fish still.
[9135.40s -> 9137.40s]  Alright, we're good.
[9137.40s -> 9144.25s]  So I gotta get back there.
[9144.25s -> 9146.25s]  Alright, locate the escape door.
[9146.25s -> 9149.26s]  Here's the token detailed
[9149.26s -> 9151.26s]  with a relief of the Ark Society
[9151.26s -> 9153.26s]  insignia. Looks significant. Yes, I need it for the door.
[9155.26s -> 9160.18s]  This dude over here.
[9160.18s -> 9162.68s]  Is anyone going to
[9162.68s -> 9165.94s]  stop me from doing this?
[9165.94s -> 9167.94s]  Stop me from doing this?
[9167.94s -> 9170.57s]  Okay, this guy. I'm going to electrocute this guy.
[9170.57s -> 9172.57s]  That's very, very, very certain.
[9172.57s -> 9179.03s]  Like, look.
[9179.03s -> 9181.78s]  I need a screwdriver to do this.
[9187.27s -> 9189.27s]  Alright, well, is there anywhere I can go from here?
[9189.27s -> 9193.05s]  Yes, I'm currently trespassing,
[9193.05s -> 9195.05s]  but I can climb through this window.
[9195.05s -> 9198.12s]  Let me get some tools.
[9198.12s -> 9203.48s]  A wrench. Alright, we're getting to like
[9203.48s -> 9205.48s]  the weird creepy section now.
[9205.48s -> 9208.94s]  Turn on this case.
[9208.94s -> 9211.37s]  It's over here.
[9211.37s -> 9216.49s]  I'm in the crypt?
[9216.49s -> 9223.13s]  Actually, this is good.
[9223.13s -> 9225.13s]  This guy comes over here and I'm going to out fish him.
[9225.13s -> 9233.13s]  Ooh, coins.
[9233.13s -> 9240.17s]  I'm going to go up the stairs.
[9240.17s -> 9242.17s]  I need an outfit though before I do anything else.
[9242.17s -> 9244.17s]  Don't kill him.
[9244.17s -> 9249.29s]  I have an alt here.
[9249.29s -> 9252.04s]  Is it just the one guy? It is.
[9252.04s -> 9256.20s]  Okay, why don't we make too much noise?
[9256.20s -> 9267.72s]  I should be able to get him both.
[9274.22s -> 9276.22s]  Well, there's always a period of adjustment
[9276.22s -> 9278.22s]  when you get a new job, I suppose.
[9278.22s -> 9280.22s]  This is like eavesdropping.
[9280.22s -> 9282.22s]  The point is to keep your eyes on the money.
[9282.22s -> 9284.22s]  This job pays ten times more
[9284.22s -> 9286.22s]  than what the Russian mob pays
[9286.22s -> 9288.22s]  and it's a lot more cleaner.
[9288.22s -> 9290.22s]  I wonder how this guy moves.
[9290.22s -> 9292.22s]  That was an interesting pose.
[9292.22s -> 9294.22s]  I can't dump him?
[9294.22s -> 9296.22s]  Okay, we're good.
[9296.22s -> 9300.76s]  Man.
[9300.76s -> 9314.01s]  I'm going to try and get him.
[9314.01s -> 9326.17s]  I'm going to try and get him.
[9326.17s -> 9334.47s]  Okay, we're good.
[9334.47s -> 9336.47s]  Man, this place is killing my computer.
[9336.47s -> 9346.52s]  Can I put him in a sarcophagus?
[9346.52s -> 9356.12s]  He can go in here.
[9356.12s -> 9360.66s]  Turn on V-Sync.
[9360.66s -> 9362.66s]  V-Sync makes my computer have input lag.
[9362.66s -> 9371.48s]  Look at the music.
[9371.48s -> 9373.48s]  Alright, so now I can try and go back
[9373.48s -> 9375.48s]  to where I was in that other area.
[9375.48s -> 9377.48s]  Alright, I might have to because
[9377.48s -> 9383.75s]  this is going to be impossible.
[9383.75s -> 9385.75s]  I don't think it's going to help but I'll give it a try.
[9385.75s -> 9394.84s]  Usually I get bad input lag
[9394.84s -> 9405.85s]  when I have V-Sync turned on.
[9405.85s -> 9407.85s]  Alright, so here we go.
[9407.85s -> 9409.85s]  Locate the escape door hydraulics.
[9409.85s -> 9413.24s]  Safety protocol.
[9413.24s -> 9415.42s]  Sabotage the hydraulics.
[9415.42s -> 9418.49s]  I need a wrench.
[9418.49s -> 9420.49s]  Which I have but
[9420.49s -> 9422.73s]  this is going to make a lot of noise.
[9422.73s -> 9424.73s]  The cage beneath the giant effigy
[9424.73s -> 9426.73s]  in the courtyard features a hidden escape door
[9426.73s -> 9428.73s]  but according to the safety report, the hydraulic locking mechanism
[9428.73s -> 9430.73s]  is disturbingly sensitive.
[9430.73s -> 9432.73s]  Even a slight drop in pressure could
[9432.73s -> 9434.73s]  jam the lock and effectively trap the
[9434.73s -> 9437.54s]  occupant inside the cage.
[9437.54s -> 9452.20s]  Okay.
[9452.20s -> 9455.38s]  Sabotaged.
[9455.38s -> 9457.38s]  Locate the master of ceremonies.
[9457.38s -> 9465.45s]  He's up.
[9465.45s -> 9467.45s]  Oh, I can go up here.
[9467.45s -> 9469.69s]  Definitely I can go up this ladder.
[9469.69s -> 9471.93s]  Nice. Sick.
[9471.93s -> 9473.93s]  Sick. Nice kid.
[9473.93s -> 9482.18s]  Sick kid. Nice kid.
[9482.18s -> 9484.94s]  Oh dear.
[9509.18s -> 9516.71s]  Don't do that.
[9516.71s -> 9520.17s]  Watch out.
[9520.17s -> 9532.26s]  So, oh, okay.
[9532.26s -> 9544.49s]  Can't really go that way.
[9544.49s -> 9547.24s]  Everyone falls for the ladder.
[9547.24s -> 9549.24s]  Literally everyone. Really?
[9549.24s -> 9551.80s]  I mean, it just seems
[9551.80s -> 9553.80s]  so easy, doesn't it?
[9553.80s -> 9559.50s]  It just looks like it's so convenient
[9559.50s -> 9561.50s]  that it's too good to be true.
[9561.50s -> 9568.41s]  I feel like I still could do it though.
[9568.41s -> 9572.12s]  I just have to wait until this guy's not turning around.
[9572.12s -> 9580.89s]  Yeah, that's the problem. Okay.
[9580.89s -> 9582.89s]  Okay, so now I gotta go from here, back here.
[9582.89s -> 9589.67s]  I mean, this...
[9589.67s -> 9591.67s]  I could drop that, but that's too risky.
[9591.67s -> 9593.67s]  He's in here.
[9593.67s -> 9597.19s]  Two guys. I don't have any keys.
[9597.19s -> 9603.08s]  There he is. Found him.
[9615.54s -> 9617.54s]  Okay, well, he's the only one that can see through.
[9617.54s -> 9619.78s]  What do we got? Okay, we got...
[9621.78s -> 9623.78s]  Master of Ceremonies schedule.
[9626.86s -> 9628.86s]  Okay.
[9628.86s -> 9630.86s]  A moment to moment schedule for the FG ceremony.
[9630.86s -> 9632.86s]  The Master of Ceremonies appears on stage.
[9632.86s -> 9634.86s]  He descends to the money pit.
[9634.86s -> 9636.86s]  He makes a short statement and lights the money on fire.
[9636.86s -> 9639.16s]  The Master summons Zoe Washington on stage.
[9639.16s -> 9641.16s]  Zoe makes a speech
[9641.16s -> 9643.16s]  whereupon she enters the cage beneath the effigy.
[9643.16s -> 9645.16s]  The Master takes the stage
[9645.16s -> 9647.16s]  and lights the effigy on fire.
[9647.16s -> 9649.16s]  Zoe slips out the back door before the structure
[9649.16s -> 9651.85s]  is engulfed in flames.
[9655.85s -> 9659.43s]  I don't think I have poison.
[9664.30s -> 9672.60s]  What else do I got here?
[9672.60s -> 9676.89s]  Coin.
[9676.89s -> 9679.83s]  Where's it gonna go?
[9679.83s -> 9681.83s]  I got guard here.
[9681.83s -> 9684.65s]  I got music box.
[9684.65s -> 9699.05s]  And...
[9699.05s -> 9703.53s]  Nobody cares about this?
[9703.53s -> 9707.69s]  You're the only one that's gonna look at this distraction?
[9707.69s -> 9709.69s]  No, that's not how this is gonna go down.
[9743.32s -> 9746.14s]  And he got the coin too.
[9746.14s -> 9749.21s]  Ha! Did that not hit anybody?
[9751.51s -> 9754.39s]  That's just about enough of this.
[9754.39s -> 9770.01s]  Did he open the door?
[9770.01s -> 9772.01s]  Oh!
[9772.01s -> 9777.13s]  Boomerang!
[9777.13s -> 9779.13s]  I got the boomerang, but it didn't matter.
[9808.15s -> 9810.15s]  Fuck me. Did I really not save it?
[9810.15s -> 9830.81s]  What happened?
[9830.81s -> 9832.81s]  I dropped the chandelier
[9832.81s -> 9835.05s]  and it didn't hit anybody.
[9835.05s -> 9837.05s]  It went right between them both.
[9837.05s -> 9839.05s]  In a perfect spot.
[9839.05s -> 9841.80s]  And then I lost my mind
[9841.80s -> 9843.80s]  and started throwing shit at people.
[9843.80s -> 9845.80s]  And then somebody was found and I unloaded a clip.
[9845.80s -> 9875.37s]  Alright, here we go.
[9875.37s -> 9878.25s]  Let's try this again.
[9878.25s -> 9882.22s]  Save it here.
[9882.22s -> 9884.78s]  One, two, three.
[9896.76s -> 9898.76s]  Alright.
[9898.76s -> 9904.07s]  Go examine somebody.
[9904.07s -> 9919.30s]  So this is not gonna kill him.
[9919.30s -> 9921.30s]  I have to wait until he turns it off and then leaves.
[9942.22s -> 9944.22s]  Close it!
[9944.22s -> 9948.06s]  Close it!
[9948.06s -> 9950.06s]  Same exact scenario.
[9950.06s -> 9952.06s]  Just did it.
[9952.06s -> 9956.22s]  The same scenario.
[9956.22s -> 9959.99s]  Give me his stuff.
[9959.99s -> 9964.09s]  I can't even...
[9964.09s -> 9969.14s]  Get over here.
[9969.14s -> 9974.33s]  I can't believe it.
[9974.33s -> 9978.74s]  I can't hide you here.
[9978.74s -> 9980.74s]  The only difference is he went the other direction.
[9980.74s -> 9985.48s]  Oh my god.
[9985.48s -> 9987.48s]  Why is my computer hate this level so much?
[10003.98s -> 10010.76s]  Don't let me forget that coin.
[10010.76s -> 10017.54s]  Oh, that's full.
[10017.54s -> 10019.54s]  Drop the gun.
[10019.54s -> 10021.54s]  The master of ceremonies with the fucking machine gun.
[10021.54s -> 10029.08s]  Give me the coin.
[10029.08s -> 10034.33s]  Was there one on the ground here too or just that one?
[10034.33s -> 10036.33s]  Okay. Gun.
[10036.33s -> 10038.70s]  Drop it.
[10038.70s -> 10041.13s]  Drop it.
[10041.13s -> 10043.13s]  All I have is the coins.
[10043.13s -> 10046.01s]  As a fish illegal.
[10046.01s -> 10048.01s]  They're not gonna care. They're gonna think I'm a weird person.
[10048.01s -> 10060.23s]  That's it.
[10060.23s -> 10062.23s]  I already know this.
[10062.23s -> 10064.23s]  I can stuff this one in my pants.
[10064.23s -> 10066.23s]  So we got it. I got fish.
[10066.23s -> 10068.23s]  Two coins.
[10068.23s -> 10070.23s]  Make sure the fish is what's currently equipped.
[10070.23s -> 10077.59s]  Save it. It's time to do it. Let's do it.
[10077.59s -> 10080.60s]  All right. Now the ceremony's down here.
[10080.60s -> 10082.90s]  They all can see through this disguise.
[10082.90s -> 10084.90s]  And here goes Doctor Strange.
[10084.90s -> 10091.24s]  Okay, Dad.
[10091.24s -> 10093.24s]  You accidentally ordered the giant fish.
[10093.24s -> 10096.06s]  I'm sorry.
[10096.06s -> 10103.61s]  I'm sorry.
[10103.61s -> 10106.81s]  I'm sorry.
[10106.81s -> 10108.81s]  I'm sorry, Dad.
[10108.81s -> 10110.81s]  You accidentally ordered the children's size costume on Amazon.
[10110.81s -> 10112.81s]  You didn't want to send it back.
[10112.81s -> 10120.04s]  I get it.
[10120.04s -> 10123.18s]  Master of ceremonies.
[10123.18s -> 10126.12s]  Begin.
[10132.06s -> 10139.03s]  Do I have anything to say?
[10139.03s -> 10156.50s]  No speech or anything?
[10156.50s -> 10160.28s]  Okay.
[10164.28s -> 10166.28s]  I did this earlier and everybody was mad at me.
[10166.28s -> 10168.28s]  Just having a dumb shitty costume on.
[10168.28s -> 10170.28s]  It's cool.
[10170.28s -> 10180.84s]  I don't have time for this.
[10180.84s -> 10188.65s]  This is what Jerma does to his bits and
[10188.65s -> 10192.62s]  cheers.
[10192.62s -> 10194.62s]  All right. There she is.
[10194.62s -> 10201.21s]  She's going around.
[10201.21s -> 10203.77s]  We're going to save it here.
[10203.77s -> 10206.01s]  Because I can't be trusted.
[10206.01s -> 10214.78s]  I already know this.
[10214.78s -> 10220.20s]  Cook fish.
[10227.38s -> 10229.38s]  That guy was going to investigate.
[10229.38s -> 10231.38s]  What was that sound?
[10231.38s -> 10236.95s]  Ceremony.
[10236.95s -> 10240.41s]  Summon Zoe Washington.
[10240.41s -> 10248.86s]  Zoe Washington.
[10248.86s -> 10251.61s]  The Arc Society
[10251.61s -> 10253.61s]  recognizes you as
[10253.61s -> 10255.61s]  our founder's rightful
[10255.61s -> 10257.61s]  successor.
[10257.61s -> 10259.61s]  Our inspiration.
[10259.61s -> 10261.61s]  Our guiding light.
[10261.61s -> 10263.61s]  The custodian of our future.
[10263.61s -> 10265.61s]  When you were at my side?
[10265.61s -> 10267.61s]  Excellent work, 47.
[10267.61s -> 10270.23s]  Enjoy the spotlight.
[10270.23s -> 10272.23s]  Patrons of the Arc Society.
[10272.23s -> 10274.23s]  You are part of a select
[10274.23s -> 10276.23s]  chosen few.
[10276.23s -> 10278.23s]  Our founder, Janus, showed us
[10278.23s -> 10280.23s]  how to survive. But survival is
[10280.23s -> 10282.23s]  not enough. We must live
[10282.23s -> 10284.23s]  and we must soar.
[10284.23s -> 10286.23s]  The Arc Society must not only commit
[10286.23s -> 10288.23s]  itself to survival, but to progress.
[10288.23s -> 10290.23s]  Be it our next home in the stars
[10290.23s -> 10292.23s]  or the next step in human evolution.
[10292.23s -> 10294.23s]  There's a giant shot down here.
[10294.23s -> 10296.23s]  This is the eternal purpose of the elite.
[10296.23s -> 10298.23s]  Not just to lead,
[10298.23s -> 10300.23s]  but to lead from the front.
[10300.23s -> 10302.23s]  She sounds so happy.
[10302.23s -> 10304.23s]  When mankind
[10304.23s -> 10306.23s]  retreats once more into caves
[10306.23s -> 10308.23s]  of superstition, we will keep
[10308.23s -> 10310.23s]  the fire alight.
[10310.23s -> 10312.23s]  We will be the torch bearers, the trail
[10312.23s -> 10314.23s]  blazers and pioneers.
[10314.23s -> 10316.23s]  Do not feel guilty for your
[10316.23s -> 10318.23s]  privilege.
[10318.23s -> 10320.23s]  Be fearless.
[10320.23s -> 10322.23s]  For the future
[10322.23s -> 10324.23s]  is ours to shake.
[10324.23s -> 10328.65s]  Alright, get in.
[10328.65s -> 10354.95s]  Hello, sir.
[10354.95s -> 10358.02s]  Look at you, Fenneker. All dressed
[10358.02s -> 10360.39s]  to kill. Now let's do this thing.
[10360.39s -> 10374.20s]  Light her up.
[10374.20s -> 10376.20s]  As the world burns,
[10376.20s -> 10378.20s]  we rise
[10378.20s -> 10380.20s]  from its ashes.
[10380.20s -> 10382.20s]  Not just to survive,
[10382.20s -> 10406.26s]  but to live.
[10406.26s -> 10408.26s]  One target down. Nice work,
[10408.26s -> 10410.26s]  Felicity. Next up,
[10410.26s -> 10412.26s]  Sophia Washington.
[10412.26s -> 10428.14s]  I tried to save her!
[10428.14s -> 10433.56s]  Oh, fuck. This is why I can't be trusted.
[10433.56s -> 10437.59s]  Zoe Washington.
[10437.59s -> 10439.96s]  Oh my god, I'm so sorry.
[10439.96s -> 10441.96s]  I thought I had to save you earlier.
[10443.96s -> 10445.96s]  We have to listen to this speech again.
[10445.96s -> 10447.96s]  But I'll be up there and ready.
[10447.96s -> 10449.96s]  The guiding light.
[10449.96s -> 10451.96s]  The custodian of our
[10451.96s -> 10454.58s]  future.
[10454.58s -> 10456.58s]  Excellent work, 47. Enjoy the spotlight.
[10456.58s -> 10459.46s]  Patrons of the
[10459.46s -> 10465.40s]  Arc de Triomphe.
[10465.40s -> 10467.40s]  James showed us how to survive.
[10467.40s -> 10469.40s]  But survival is not enough.
[10469.40s -> 10471.40s]  We must live, and we must
[10471.40s -> 10473.40s]  soar. The Arc Society
[10473.40s -> 10475.40s]  is not only committed itself to survival,
[10475.40s -> 10477.40s]  but to progress. Be it our
[10477.40s -> 10479.40s]  next home in the stars, or the next
[10479.40s -> 10481.40s]  step in human evolution.
[10481.40s -> 10484.02s]  Is the eternal purpose
[10484.02s -> 10486.02s]  of the elite.
[10486.02s -> 10488.02s]  I'm just her son.
[10488.02s -> 10490.52s]  Time comes, and all
[10490.52s -> 10492.52s]  comes tumbling down.
[10492.52s -> 10494.52s]  Don't mind little John.
[10494.52s -> 10496.52s]  Little Johnny.
[10496.52s -> 10498.52s]  We will keep the fire alight.
[10498.52s -> 10500.52s]  He has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
[10502.52s -> 10504.52s]  Do not feel guilty
[10504.52s -> 10506.52s]  for your privilege. Be proud.
[10506.52s -> 10508.52s]  Be fearless.
[10508.52s -> 10510.52s]  For the future is ours
[10510.52s -> 10513.14s]  to shape.
[10513.14s -> 10515.14s]  Look at you, Fenager.
[10515.14s -> 10517.14s]  Now let's do this thing.
[10517.14s -> 10521.88s]  Light her up.
[10521.88s -> 10524.95s]  Hello.
[10524.95s -> 10529.24s]  As the world burns,
[10529.24s -> 10531.24s]  it's from its ashes.
[10531.24s -> 10533.24s]  Not just to survive,
[10533.24s -> 10537.02s]  but to live.
[10537.02s -> 10539.02s]  No, no, no, no.
[10539.02s -> 10557.56s]  One target down.
[10557.56s -> 10559.56s]  Nice work, 47.
[10559.56s -> 10565.19s]  Next
[10565.19s -> 10567.19s]  step, Sophia Washington.
[10567.19s -> 10570.52s]  Hey, let's imagine
[10570.52s -> 10572.52s]  an invisible barrier between
[10572.52s -> 10574.52s]  me and you that extends out to
[10574.52s -> 10576.52s]  us.
[10576.52s -> 10585.66s]  What do you think it was?
[10585.66s -> 10592.57s]  Do you think it's worth investigating?
[10592.57s -> 10595.00s]  Hey, wait a minute.
[10595.00s -> 10602.10s]  Please get out of my face.
[10602.10s -> 10614.01s]  Oh, come on.
[10614.01s -> 10616.01s]  Can you just go see what it was?
[10616.01s -> 10618.31s]  For sure. This concludes
[10618.31s -> 10620.31s]  the performance, ladies and gentlemen.
[10620.31s -> 10622.55s]  No, they're not that
[10622.55s -> 10624.55s]  stupid.
[10624.55s -> 10626.55s]  All right, eliminate Sophia Washington.
[10626.55s -> 10628.55s]  Let's go up there.
[10628.55s -> 10630.55s]  Let's see if we can find some intel.
[10630.55s -> 10632.55s]  Isn't that how it's done?
[10632.55s -> 10634.55s]  That was crazy.
[10634.55s -> 10642.68s]  I almost shat myself.
[10642.68s -> 10644.68s]  I think you are coming on a little too strong.
[10644.68s -> 10646.68s]  I almost shat myself.
[10646.68s -> 10652.44s]  Okay.
[10652.44s -> 10654.44s]  It's time.
[10654.44s -> 10656.44s]  Let's head back down.
[10656.44s -> 10658.44s]  I think we should go up here.
[10658.44s -> 10660.44s]  Okay.
[10660.44s -> 10662.44s]  I think we should go up here.
[10662.44s -> 10664.44s]  Let's head back down.
[10664.44s -> 10667.58s]  I think we should go up here.
[10667.58s -> 10672.44s]  Weird.
[10672.44s -> 10674.81s]  I believe I'm allowed to go up here.
[10674.81s -> 10676.81s]  I'm the master of ceremony.
[10676.81s -> 10682.18s]  Yeah, okay.
[10682.18s -> 10685.64s]  I got three of these.
[10685.64s -> 10690.57s]  What can I do up here?
[10690.57s -> 10707.58s]  Thank you.
[10707.58s -> 10709.58s]  What is this? The MOC.
[10709.58s -> 10711.58s]  The master of comedy.
[10711.58s -> 10715.22s]  That's right.
[10715.22s -> 10717.46s]  So,
[10717.46s -> 10719.70s]  I don't want to kill
[10719.70s -> 10721.94s]  That's it.
[10721.94s -> 10723.94s]  The constant.
[10723.94s -> 10725.94s]  Providence's top controller.
[10725.94s -> 10727.94s]  Everything depends on capturing him alive.
[10727.94s -> 10729.94s]  But this?
[10729.94s -> 10731.94s]  We're really doing this, aren't we?
[10731.94s -> 10733.94s]  That we are. Donations.
[10733.94s -> 10735.94s]  Purchases. Excavations.
[10735.94s -> 10737.94s]  Here comes a poo poo joke.
[10737.94s -> 10739.94s]  No, I'm not doing that.
[10746.41s -> 10754.09s]  Why is this guy talking like Mr.
[10754.09s -> 10756.09s]  Rogers?
[10756.09s -> 10758.90s]  Do you want to know my name?
[10767.78s -> 10769.78s]  No, I'm not going to poo on the stream, guys.
[10769.78s -> 10772.79s]  I'm not going to shit on the stream.
[10779.77s -> 10781.77s]  That's an interesting way to hold that gun.
[10781.77s -> 10783.77s]  Do you think the gun
[10783.77s -> 10787.22s]  is going to shit in your hand?
[10787.22s -> 10789.40s]  Good to see you.
[10789.40s -> 10799.45s]  Okay, we've got to get in here.
[10799.45s -> 10801.45s]  The gallery.
[10819.32s -> 10834.23s]  So.
[10834.23s -> 10836.23s]  It was lost for over 500 years.
[10836.23s -> 10838.23s]  Until Blake Nathaniel unsealed
[10838.23s -> 10840.23s]  the serpent's tomb. Hello, sir.
[10840.23s -> 10842.23s]  Extraordinary. It's a flippy necklace.
[10842.23s -> 10844.23s]  Anyway, the Washington
[10844.23s -> 10846.23s]  twins found it first.
[10846.23s -> 10850.70s]  No.
[10850.70s -> 10852.70s]  That was the only lead on the parties.
[10852.70s -> 10859.22s]  Abort mission.
[10859.22s -> 10869.46s]  Through the glass.
[10869.46s -> 10871.64s]  It was lost for over 500 years.
[10871.64s -> 10873.64s]  Until Blake Nathaniel unsealed
[10873.64s -> 10875.64s]  the serpent's tomb.
[10875.64s -> 10877.64s]  Extraordinary. It's a flippy necklace.
[10877.64s -> 10879.64s]  Anyway, the Washington
[10879.64s -> 10881.64s]  twins found it first.
[10881.64s -> 10883.64s]  The way I hear it, Sophia literally
[10883.64s -> 10885.64s]  has the necklace in her hand.
[10885.64s -> 10887.64s]  When Nathaniel repels from the ceiling,
[10887.64s -> 10889.64s]  triggers this ancient death trap.
[10889.64s -> 10891.64s]  Murder may have ensued, but
[10891.64s -> 10893.64s]  I thought those two
[10893.64s -> 10895.64s]  were lovers.
[10895.64s -> 10897.64s]  On and off.
[10897.64s -> 10899.64s]  Currently way off, which explains the added security.
[10899.64s -> 10901.64s]  I don't follow.
[10901.64s -> 10903.64s]  Think about it. Why the need
[10903.64s -> 10905.64s]  for an alarm system where all
[10905.64s -> 10907.64s]  filthy rich accept?
[10907.64s -> 10909.64s]  Ah, I see.
[10909.64s -> 10911.64s]  Blake thinks Sophia
[10911.64s -> 10913.64s]  might try and steal back the necklace before it's
[10913.64s -> 10915.64s]  sealed in the Ark of the Legacy.
[10915.64s -> 10917.64s]  So, according to its charter,
[10917.64s -> 10919.64s]  the Ark Society collects priceless
[10919.64s -> 10921.64s]  art and historical artifacts in case
[10921.64s -> 10923.64s]  of a global disaster.
[10923.64s -> 10925.64s]  And this year, world famous treasure
[10925.64s -> 10927.64s]  hunter Blake Nathaniel
[10927.64s -> 10929.64s]  has donated an Aztec necklace called
[10929.64s -> 10931.64s]  the Cloud Serpent to the Ark Society's
[10931.64s -> 10933.64s]  growing collection. However,
[10933.64s -> 10935.64s]  Blake fears that Sophia Washington,
[10935.64s -> 10937.64s]  his former lover and
[10937.64s -> 10939.64s]  rival, who has hunted the Cloud Serpent
[10939.64s -> 10941.64s]  for years, will attempt to steal
[10941.64s -> 10943.64s]  it for herself before it goes into storage.
[10943.64s -> 10945.64s]  Hmm.
[10945.64s -> 10947.64s]  Could be just the bait we need.
[10947.64s -> 10949.64s]  What's this one?
[10949.64s -> 10951.64s]  I don't know. I didn't discover it.
[10951.64s -> 10955.42s]  Good grief. No honor among thieves, huh?
[10955.42s -> 10957.42s]  I'll say. Interesting.
[10957.42s -> 10959.42s]  You think?
[10959.42s -> 10961.42s]  Okay. So I need to steal the necklace.
[10961.42s -> 10966.54s]  How on earth am I going to steal this necklace?
[10966.54s -> 10968.54s]  Hmm.
[10968.54s -> 10972.57s]  Alarm sensors.
[10972.57s -> 10974.57s]  You'll need to disable the system to get
[10974.57s -> 10976.57s]  at the necklace, 47.
[10976.57s -> 10982.26s]  I could just pull the fire alarm, right?
[10982.26s -> 10986.62s]  Why don't I just pull the fire alarm?
[10986.62s -> 10988.62s]  There's the fuse box.
[10988.62s -> 10990.62s]  Can I steal? Are these allowed?
[10990.62s -> 11005.53s]  What?
[11020.02s -> 11035.83s]  You have to eat all the eggs.
[11035.83s -> 11040.50s]  Okay. Well, this is...
[11040.50s -> 11043.13s]  It goes up there.
[11043.13s -> 11045.13s]  Do I need to climb this?
[11045.13s -> 11047.82s]  They're going to obviously... I need to turn the
[11047.82s -> 11049.82s]  lights off because they're going to see me do this.
[11049.82s -> 11051.82s]  Hmm. Alarm sensors.
[11051.82s -> 11053.82s]  You'll need to disable the system to get
[11053.82s -> 11055.82s]  at the necklace, 47.
[11055.82s -> 11069.00s]  I didn't... I'm trying to turn off the
[11069.00s -> 11073.67s]  lights. I guess it worked.
[11073.67s -> 11079.80s]  Well...
[11079.80s -> 11081.80s]  Hey! This area is off-limits!
[11081.80s -> 11083.80s]  I'm getting help!
[11083.80s -> 11086.42s]  I don't like... Hey!
[11086.42s -> 11088.42s]  Better get your head out of your ass double quick!
[11088.42s -> 11090.42s]  Hey, you! This is a restricted area!
[11090.42s -> 11092.79s]  Hey, wait a minute!
[11092.79s -> 11095.35s]  I'm taking you out of here.
[11095.35s -> 11100.41s]  Follow me.
[11100.41s -> 11102.41s]  I already told you to follow me.
[11102.41s -> 11106.57s]  What's the problem, bozo?
[11106.57s -> 11108.94s]  Hey, you!
[11108.94s -> 11112.95s]  That's going to hurt me!
[11112.95s -> 11114.95s]  Man!
[11114.95s -> 11118.60s]  I got to hack the system!
[11118.60s -> 11123.06s]  Well, alright.
[11123.06s -> 11127.22s]  So there's a shitload of people up there.
[11127.22s -> 11133.56s]  Okay.
[11133.56s -> 11135.56s]  Alright. And they can all see... I've got to get a different disguise.
[11135.56s -> 11137.86s]  It was lost for over
[11137.86s -> 11139.86s]  500 years.
[11139.86s -> 11141.86s]  Actually, I might...
[11141.86s -> 11143.86s]  I might be able to get it.
[11143.86s -> 11145.86s]  Anyway, the Washington
[11145.86s -> 11147.86s]  twins found it first.
[11147.86s -> 11149.86s]  The way I hear it, Sophia literally
[11149.86s -> 11151.86s]  has the necklace in her
[11151.86s -> 11153.86s]  hand. When Nathaniel repels from the ceiling,
[11153.86s -> 11155.86s]  it triggers this ancient death
[11155.86s -> 11157.86s]  trap and, you know, murder
[11157.86s -> 11159.86s]  and mayhem.
[11159.86s -> 11168.04s]  Oh, there's no door up there
[11168.04s -> 11170.04s]  though.
[11170.04s -> 11172.04s]  I think I might be
[11172.04s -> 11174.47s]  able to take him out.
[11174.47s -> 11176.47s]  It's very
[11176.47s -> 11178.47s]  possible. Right now?
[11178.47s -> 11180.47s]  Right now.
[11187.16s -> 11191.13s]  I have to go a different way, then.
[11191.13s -> 11201.43s]  It could have been possible.
[11201.43s -> 11203.43s]  If I had choked him out and ran
[11203.43s -> 11205.43s]  around.
[11205.43s -> 11207.43s]  Yeah, I know.
[11207.43s -> 11209.43s]  Alright, let's go...
[11209.43s -> 11211.43s]  I'm going to go this way.
[11211.43s -> 11214.44s]  Steal the necklace.
[11214.44s -> 11217.26s]  Don't show me the fire axe.
[11217.26s -> 11220.65s]  I'm not picking it up.
[11220.65s -> 11222.65s]  Fuck it, man.
[11272.20s -> 11284.87s]  Oh, I got you.
[11284.87s -> 11302.28s]  I got you, motherfucker. Come here.
[11306.89s -> 11313.27s]  Cool.
[11315.27s -> 11317.27s]  Why are you looking in the...
[11317.27s -> 11319.27s]  Why are you looking in here?
[11329.11s -> 11333.32s]  Are you going to investigate that or what?
[11333.32s -> 11337.48s]  Mistake.
[11337.48s -> 11343.18s]  Oh, god damn it.
[11343.18s -> 11345.35s]  I just have a fish. I have one fish.
[11345.35s -> 11359.30s]  I don't give a fuck.
[11359.30s -> 11366.54s]  Hold on, wait, that's not silenced?
[11368.78s -> 11370.78s]  That's not silenced.
[11370.78s -> 11375.77s]  Well, the guy I need to disguise
[11375.77s -> 11379.42s]  as is currently about to...
[11396.02s -> 11398.02s]  No, why'd you shoot him?
[11398.02s -> 11400.02s]  Why'd you shoot him?
[11400.02s -> 11402.02s]  I was trying to shoot him.
[11404.02s -> 11409.45s]  Oh, it's me.
[11409.45s -> 11414.25s]  This is an elite guard.
[11414.25s -> 11417.43s]  Alright.
[11417.43s -> 11419.43s]  Elite guard.
[11419.43s -> 11441.30s]  I have to dump them all.
[11441.30s -> 11443.30s]  Alright, nice. I'm ready.
[11443.30s -> 11452.65s]  Let's give it a save.
[11452.65s -> 11461.80s]  Right here.
[11461.80s -> 11465.32s]  What the hell?
[11465.32s -> 11467.32s]  Evening, sir.
[11467.32s -> 11473.96s]  Alright.
[11479.96s -> 11481.96s]  I thought that was just supposed to be him.
[11481.96s -> 11483.96s]  It's not him.
[11483.96s -> 11487.42s]  Okay, I need to disguise as
[11487.42s -> 11489.42s]  this person down here.
[11489.42s -> 11491.59s]  They're going up the stairs.
[11491.59s -> 11493.59s]  I'm going to cut you off this way.
[11493.59s -> 11498.01s]  I need that mask.
[11498.01s -> 11500.63s]  It's not going to happen.
[11500.63s -> 11502.63s]  It's just not going to happen.
[11502.63s -> 11504.63s]  In fact, I'm not going to be able to open this door either.
[11504.63s -> 11506.63s]  Unless do I have the key to the door?
[11506.63s -> 11510.09s]  I don't.
[11510.09s -> 11512.09s]  I have to sneak through this guy.
[11512.09s -> 11516.57s]  And then upstairs.
[11516.57s -> 11521.62s]  That guy can see, but it doesn't matter.
[11521.62s -> 11523.62s]  Just opens.
[11523.62s -> 11525.62s]  And then I should be able to get this...
[11525.62s -> 11533.93s]  There they go. Upstairs.
[11533.93s -> 11536.30s]  Anything in here I can do?
[11536.30s -> 11538.30s]  No, I don't need to do that.
[11538.30s -> 11540.30s]  I'm going to get a pause moment here
[11540.30s -> 11543.62s]  because I think my dog needs to go outside
[11543.62s -> 11555.19s]  before we get there.
[11563.00s -> 11568.74s]  When does he end up?
[11568.74s -> 11574.94s]  I'm going to do it too.
[11574.94s -> 11578.26s]  No, what the fuck are you doing?
[11578.26s -> 11589.21s]  I can't move.
[11600.34s -> 11609.56s]  I can't go down.
[11609.56s -> 11611.56s]  I can't drop down here?
[11611.56s -> 11618.47s]  I can't do anything.
[11618.47s -> 11620.47s]  You think that I can move to that ledge and clap?
[11620.47s -> 11628.22s]  What are they dragging him to?
[11628.22s -> 11630.22s]  Yeah, but somebody can see me out here.
[11630.22s -> 11635.14s]  I can't be out here for more than two seconds.
[11637.14s -> 11639.14s]  Oh my god.
[11639.14s -> 11641.14s]  Just slide down.
[11641.14s -> 11643.14s]  Why is it so complicated?
[11643.14s -> 11648.14s]  Where is he taking off?
[11648.14s -> 11653.32s]  I don't even know where the fuck that guy even went.
[11653.32s -> 11662.33s]  Where is he now?
[11662.33s -> 11665.66s]  Is he just gone?
[11665.66s -> 11667.66s]  Did the guy get taken out?
[11667.66s -> 11669.66s]  I got to take the dog out.
[11669.66s -> 11695.45s]  He was sprinting around
[11695.45s -> 11698.20s]  in a circle here.
[11698.20s -> 11700.20s]  He just didn't want to be in the room.
[11700.20s -> 11702.38s]  Alright.
[11702.38s -> 11704.38s]  So the question is,
[11704.38s -> 11709.62s]  did they drag them away?
[11709.62s -> 11711.62s]  I'm not sure I can do this right now.
[11711.62s -> 11723.06s]  I think I have to restart it.
[11723.06s -> 11725.75s]  Where did I save it from here?
[11725.75s -> 11728.63s]  Right here.
[11728.63s -> 11730.63s]  I'm in the same disguise, so this should be fine.
[11730.63s -> 11738.06s]  This time I'm going to push him out
[11738.06s -> 11740.06s]  and I'm just going to go right after him.
[11757.45s -> 11759.45s]  I might be able to take him here.
[11764.78s -> 11772.38s]  I don't know what it is about this level, man.
[11772.38s -> 11787.80s]  It's driving me crazy.
[11787.80s -> 11789.80s]  My CPU is not even doing anything.
[11789.80s -> 11795.88s]  I'm at like 24% CPU usage.
[11795.88s -> 11797.88s]  Why is it doing this?
[11797.88s -> 11799.88s]  I'm sorry.
[11799.88s -> 11801.88s]  I take the dog.
[11801.88s -> 11841.88s]  Can I not do this?
[11841.88s -> 11843.88s]  Is this over now?
[11843.88s -> 11846.50s]  Is this over anyways?
[11846.50s -> 11848.50s]  I can do it.
[11848.50s -> 11854.07s]  Sorry you didn't get to see that.
[11854.07s -> 11883.18s]  My god.
[11883.18s -> 11887.02s]  Does anybody know of a solution here?
[11887.02s -> 11890.01s]  Because my game just does not want to run in here.
[11890.01s -> 11892.70s]  We've turned down the graphics and everything,
[11892.70s -> 11898.26s]  but my CPU is running fine.
[11898.26s -> 11900.26s]  I have a 1080.
[11900.26s -> 11903.02s]  Why is this happening?
[11903.02s -> 11906.41s]  Don't know why.
[11906.41s -> 11908.41s]  I have a shotgun on my back.
[11908.41s -> 11920.06s]  Is it the drivers?
[11920.06s -> 11922.06s]  That actually might be...
[11922.06s -> 11925.19s]  What was this?
[11925.19s -> 11927.56s]  I need his stuff.
[11927.56s -> 11929.56s]  Well you missed it. It was really funny.
[11929.56s -> 11931.56s]  Well it wasn't that funny.
[11931.56s -> 11939.48s]  I dropped it right on his head and nobody noticed.
[11939.48s -> 11941.48s]  Angry text from Sophia.
[11941.48s -> 11947.24s]  To me.
[11947.24s -> 11949.67s]  Where is she though?
[11949.67s -> 11954.98s]  Up there.
[11954.98s -> 11967.14s]  Thank you.
[11967.14s -> 11970.66s]  Cap it at 15 frames a second.
[11977.46s -> 11981.56s]  This is so weird.
[11981.56s -> 11983.56s]  I don't know what it is, but if you're like a billionaire
[11983.56s -> 11986.44s]  or like a trillionaire.
[11986.44s -> 11988.44s]  Why are they all...
[11988.44s -> 11990.44s]  Is it all billionaires at one weird shit?
[11992.44s -> 11994.44s]  Like what is this?
[11998.44s -> 12000.87s]  Like why would you have this?
[12000.87s -> 12002.87s]  What is this for?
[12008.87s -> 12010.87s]  Like what are the screens that just have one image?
[12027.02s -> 12029.02s]  Hello?
[12029.02s -> 12031.45s]  Hi.
[12031.45s -> 12033.45s]  Sophia.
[12033.45s -> 12035.45s]  I almost didn't recognize you without
[12035.45s -> 12037.45s]  a knife in my back.
[12037.45s -> 12039.45s]  I see that now.
[12039.45s -> 12041.88s]  This should be good.
[12041.88s -> 12055.30s]  Follow me.
[12055.30s -> 12057.30s]  Excellent 47.
[12057.30s -> 12059.30s]  Let's give Sophia her heart's desire, shall we?
[12059.30s -> 12061.30s]  You've got one minute.
[12061.30s -> 12063.30s]  I did wrong by you Sophia.
[12063.30s -> 12065.30s]  I see that now.
[12065.30s -> 12067.30s]  And I want to make amends.
[12067.30s -> 12069.30s]  Here, this is rightfully yours.
[12069.30s -> 12071.48s]  Well, well.
[12071.48s -> 12073.48s]  Look who comes crawling back.
[12073.48s -> 12075.48s]  Leave us.
[12075.48s -> 12083.10s]  You know,
[12083.10s -> 12085.10s]  we lost three men because of you.
[12085.10s -> 12087.10s]  Wicus was crushed by a rolling
[12087.10s -> 12089.10s]  boulder.
[12089.10s -> 12091.10s]  We only escape
[12091.10s -> 12093.10s]  the arrows by using one of the local
[12093.10s -> 12095.10s]  guides as a human shield.
[12095.10s -> 12101.30s]  Now this is a nice
[12101.30s -> 12103.30s]  gesture.
[12103.30s -> 12105.30s]  I know.
[12105.30s -> 12107.30s]  May I?
[12107.30s -> 12110.18s]  Money counter.
[12110.18s -> 12112.18s]  You know, I thought about sending the boys after you.
[12112.18s -> 12114.18s]  Grab the necklace and cut your throat
[12114.18s -> 12116.18s]  ear to ear. You probably wonder
[12116.18s -> 12118.62s]  why I didn't. The truth is
[12118.62s -> 12120.62s]  you beat us, Blake. I don't deny
[12120.62s -> 12122.62s]  it. And I can't very well get
[12122.62s -> 12134.97s]  Both targets down.
[12134.97s -> 12136.97s]  Impressive work, 47.
[12136.97s -> 12138.97s]  And now to confront the constant.
[12138.97s -> 12140.97s]  Kill switch.
[12140.97s -> 12142.97s]  Mr. Gray, what's your status?
[12142.97s -> 12144.97s]  I'm at the helicopter, but the place
[12144.97s -> 12146.97s]  is crawling with security.
[12146.97s -> 12148.97s]  47, you better bring the constant to one
[12148.97s -> 12150.97s]  of the boats in the harbor where it's quiet.
[12150.97s -> 12152.97s]  Can I put her in the chair? You can use the kill
[12152.97s -> 12156.42s]  switch to coerce.
[12156.42s -> 12158.42s]  Can I put her in the chair like she's sitting in the chair?
[12158.42s -> 12162.01s]  In the window?
[12162.01s -> 12164.01s]  No, I'm not putting her in the window.
[12164.01s -> 12168.23s]  Does he put the cup in the room?
[12168.23s -> 12170.23s]  Help Lucas Gray extract the optional.
[12170.23s -> 12174.52s]  Talk to the constant.
[12174.52s -> 12186.81s]  He's right here.
[12186.81s -> 12188.81s]  The Washingtons are dead. I have the kill switch.
[12188.81s -> 12191.94s]  What did you say?
[12191.94s -> 12193.94s]  How could you know about that?
[12193.94s -> 12195.94s]  You will head towards the harbor.
[12195.94s -> 12197.94s]  No sudden moves.
[12197.94s -> 12199.94s]  No signs or warnings.
[12199.94s -> 12201.94s]  I will trigger the device if I need to.
[12201.94s -> 12203.94s]  I know you.
[12203.94s -> 12205.94s]  The boy in the picture.
[12205.94s -> 12207.94s]  You have his eyes.
[12207.94s -> 12209.94s]  You're Bynwood's assassin.
[12209.94s -> 12217.62s]  Move.
[12217.62s -> 12219.62s]  Everybody thinks I'm gonna do it.
[12219.62s -> 12221.62s]  But I'm not gonna do it.
[12221.62s -> 12223.93s]  Partners, no more. I take it.
[12223.93s -> 12225.93s]  I had a notion
[12225.93s -> 12227.93s]  Something didn't sit right with my
[12227.93s -> 12229.93s]  I'm not gonna do it.
[12229.93s -> 12231.93s]  You murdered him
[12231.93s -> 12236.14s]  I take it to be
[12236.14s -> 12238.14s]  Not just that. He had it coming.
[12238.14s -> 12240.82s]  No, I can't do it.
[12240.82s -> 12242.82s]  I need to get two stars.
[12242.82s -> 12244.82s]  Such sentiment.
[12244.82s -> 12246.82s]  If I don't get two stars then what the hell?
[12246.82s -> 12248.82s]  The doctor built his serum specifically
[12248.82s -> 12250.82s]  to target the seeds of your emotions.
[12250.82s -> 12252.82s]  Has Ms. Bynwood's
[12252.82s -> 12254.82s]  sense of justice rubbed off on you?
[12254.82s -> 12256.82s]  I wonder.
[12256.82s -> 12258.82s]  You must keep walking.
[12258.82s -> 12294.33s]  That's the original five?
[12294.33s -> 12296.33s]  For what it's worth.
[12296.33s -> 12298.33s]  Janus always found
[12298.33s -> 12300.33s]  Ortmeier's project distasteful
[12300.33s -> 12302.33s]  not to mention inefficient.
[12302.33s -> 12304.76s]  S.
[12304.76s -> 12306.76s]  Sometimes you have to play the hand
[12306.76s -> 12308.76s]  you're dealt.
[12308.76s -> 12311.77s]  What if it doesn't work?
[12311.77s -> 12313.77s]  This is just an elaborate ruse and this doesn't even do anything?
[12313.77s -> 12315.77s]  Look at all these ruse patterns.
[12315.77s -> 12325.94s]  Just test it to see if it works.
[12325.94s -> 12330.30s]  Better test it to make sure.
[12330.30s -> 12332.30s]  Make sure it works.
[12332.30s -> 12334.47s]  Okay.
[12334.47s -> 12341.19s]  I guess we'll make sure it works.
[12341.19s -> 12343.50s]  No. 47.
[12343.50s -> 12345.50s]  That was our only lead on the partners.
[12345.50s -> 12347.50s]  Abort mission.
[12347.50s -> 12356.97s]  Alright, it works.
[12356.97s -> 12358.97s]  He's faking it. He could hear the button click.
[12358.97s -> 12362.68s]  He heard like...
[12362.68s -> 12370.74s]  Let me get that door for you.
[12370.74s -> 12372.74s]  I take it this is not an ICA
[12372.74s -> 12374.74s]  sanctioned operation.
[12374.74s -> 12376.74s]  What exactly does Ms. Bynwood
[12376.74s -> 12378.74s]  plan to achieve by targeting her clients?
[12378.74s -> 12380.74s]  Violating her own code?
[12380.74s -> 12382.74s]  She's doing it.
[12382.74s -> 12384.74s]  For us.
[12384.74s -> 12387.37s]  Us? Or C?
[12387.37s -> 12389.37s]  The penny drops.
[12389.37s -> 12392.74s]  I should have known.
[12392.74s -> 12394.74s]  How does a man leave no trace?
[12394.74s -> 12396.92s]  Did I break my eyebrow?
[12396.92s -> 12399.10s]  Did I?
[12399.10s -> 12402.41s]  Did I?
[12402.41s -> 12404.71s]  Me.
[12404.71s -> 12406.95s]  Or was it Subject 6?
[12406.95s -> 12408.95s]  He died when the Institute...
[12408.95s -> 12410.95s]  Oh shit.
[12410.95s -> 12412.95s]  Oh shit.
[12412.95s -> 12414.95s]  Is it because I ran in front of him and
[12414.95s -> 12422.87s]  opened the door?
[12422.87s -> 12424.87s]  Okay.
[12424.87s -> 12442.54s]  We're almost there.
[12442.54s -> 12444.54s]  I take it this is not an ICA
[12444.54s -> 12446.54s]  sanctioned operation.
[12446.54s -> 12448.54s]  What exactly does Ms. Bynwood
[12448.54s -> 12450.54s]  plan to achieve by targeting her clients?
[12450.54s -> 12452.54s]  Violating her own code?
[12452.54s -> 12454.54s]  She's doing it.
[12454.54s -> 12456.54s]  For us.
[12456.54s -> 12458.54s]  Us? Or C?
[12458.54s -> 12461.48s]  The penny drops.
[12461.48s -> 12463.48s]  The penny drops.
[12463.48s -> 12466.49s]  I should have known.
[12466.49s -> 12468.49s]  How does a man leave no trace?
[12468.49s -> 12470.98s]  By not existing in the first
[12470.98s -> 12472.98s]  place.
[12472.98s -> 12474.98s]  Lucas Gray.
[12474.98s -> 12476.98s]  Or was it Subject 6?
[12476.98s -> 12478.98s]  This guy is my hair.
[12478.98s -> 12480.98s]  Nope.
[12480.98s -> 12482.98s]  I don't have a bald spot on the top of my head. Sorry to disappoint you.
[12482.98s -> 12484.98s]  Unlike you, his rage
[12484.98s -> 12487.29s]  never faded.
[12487.29s -> 12489.66s]  So, now you want the nurse.
[12489.66s -> 12491.66s]  The men behind the curtain
[12491.66s -> 12494.15s]  caused you all this pain.
[12494.15s -> 12502.39s]  Before you go knocking down
[12502.39s -> 12505.02s]  Yes. Hello.
[12505.02s -> 12507.02s]  You see there are more people
[12507.02s -> 12509.45s]  above me.
[12509.45s -> 12511.45s]  It's the water that does it. The first mission did
[12511.45s -> 12521.11s]  the same thing. It's all these
[12521.11s -> 12523.11s]  waves that are doing it for some reason.
[12523.11s -> 12526.38s]  Disable water.
[12526.38s -> 12528.38s]  You can't. I can't turn the water off.
[12528.38s -> 12542.58s]  Yikes.
[12542.58s -> 12564.58s]  Jesus.
[12564.58s -> 12567.02s]  Got him.
[12567.02s -> 12569.02s]  I mean that was
[12569.02s -> 12583.72s]  pretty clean.
[12583.72s -> 12585.72s]  Right?
[12585.72s -> 12588.09s]  Like if I get zero stars
[12588.09s -> 12590.09s]  then I mean
[12590.09s -> 12593.03s]  it has to be all the time that I just keep
[12593.03s -> 12595.03s]  reloading and doing stupid things.
[12595.03s -> 12599.45s]  It was like clean enough to not have
[12599.45s -> 12601.45s]  I mean it's gotta be because I'm
[12601.45s -> 12603.45s]  fucking restarting and throwing people off
[12603.45s -> 12630.14s]  balconies. Plus
[12630.14s -> 12632.14s]  zero. It's cause I'm like killing people
[12632.14s -> 12634.63s]  and shit. It was pretty clean.
[12634.63s -> 12636.63s]  Alright we're going to the chapel. The gatehouse.
[12636.63s -> 12638.63s]  We have this mace now.
[12638.63s -> 12644.14s]  A mace.
[12644.14s -> 12646.14s]  Lethal syringe. Finally unlock the syringe.
[12646.14s -> 12649.53s]  And here are the other options for this
[12649.53s -> 12651.53s]  particular part of the game.
[12651.53s -> 12653.53s]  We're on to the final area of
[12653.53s -> 12655.96s]  Hitman 2. This is the last
[12655.96s -> 12657.96s]  area I believe.
[12657.96s -> 12670.25s]  Final area. Not final mission obviously.
[12670.25s -> 12672.25s]  Cause there are six places.
[12672.25s -> 12679.80s]  Wasn't that the final
[12679.80s -> 12682.68s]  area was it? That was the last
[12682.68s -> 12684.68s]  one. Mr. Edwards
[12684.68s -> 12686.68s]  I still think this is maintenance.
[12686.68s -> 12688.68s]  Oh I thought there was another. I thought there was one more.
[12688.68s -> 12690.68s]  Oh Miss Burnwood.
[12690.68s -> 12692.68s]  What have you done?
[12692.68s -> 12694.92s]  Changing horses
[12694.92s -> 12696.92s]  midstream?
[12696.92s -> 12698.92s]  Truly unprofessional.
[12698.92s -> 12701.61s]  You know what we want.
[12701.61s -> 12706.09s]  Where is the carrot?
[12706.09s -> 12708.09s]  No carrot.
[12708.09s -> 12710.09s]  You're useless to the partners.
[12710.09s -> 12712.09s]  Compromised. Even if we let
[12712.09s -> 12714.09s]  you live you can never return.
[12714.09s -> 12716.09s]  Why die protecting
[12716.09s -> 12718.09s]  them? When I can drag them
[12718.09s -> 12720.09s]  down with me?
[12720.09s -> 12722.58s]  It's a bad hand.
[12722.58s -> 12729.82s]  But it's all you've got.
[12729.82s -> 12731.82s]  Three families.
[12731.82s -> 12734.57s]  That's all it took.
[12734.57s -> 12736.57s]  The Ingrams.
[12736.57s -> 12738.57s]  The Carlyles. The Stuyvesants.
[12738.57s -> 12740.57s]  Three
[12740.57s -> 12742.57s]  dynasties. Secretly
[12742.57s -> 12744.57s]  pooling their resources
[12744.57s -> 12746.57s]  over generations.
[12746.57s -> 12748.57s]  Creating a singularity
[12748.57s -> 12750.57s]  so dense that nothing
[12750.57s -> 12752.57s]  escapes its gravity.
[12752.57s -> 12754.57s]  Never heard of them. Well they've heard
[12754.57s -> 12756.57s]  of you. In fact
[12756.57s -> 12758.57s]  you just became the top of their
[12758.57s -> 12760.98s]  agenda. Go.
[12760.98s -> 12764.82s]  We can't give them time to retaliate.
[12764.82s -> 12770.97s]  Don't take your eyes off him.
[12770.97s -> 12775.19s]  He's gonna get out. Be careful.
[12775.19s -> 12777.62s]  Well here we are again.
[12777.62s -> 12779.62s]  I must admit
[12779.62s -> 12781.62s]  I am disappointed Miss Burnwood.
[12781.62s -> 12783.62s]  I had such
[12783.62s -> 12785.62s]  big plans for you.
[12785.62s -> 12787.62s]  Save it. He's gonna get out. I know the truth
[12787.62s -> 12789.62s]  now. You're outplayed.
[12789.62s -> 12791.62s]  You have nothing left to bargain with.
[12791.62s -> 12793.62s]  You're so certain.
[12793.62s -> 12795.62s]  So sure
[12795.62s -> 12797.62s]  of the people closest to you.
[12797.62s -> 12799.62s]  Was he a bad guy?
[12799.62s -> 12801.62s]  He never
[12801.62s -> 12803.62s]  misses his mark.
[12803.62s -> 12806.95s]  You found a window
[12806.95s -> 12808.95s]  into his past.
[12808.95s -> 12813.29s]  And yet
[12813.29s -> 12815.29s]  something else remains
[12815.29s -> 12822.14s]  hidden. So it was
[12822.14s -> 12824.14s]  me the whole time. A simple truth you learned
[12824.14s -> 12826.14s]  long ago.
[12826.14s -> 12830.55s]  No one, Miss
[12830.55s -> 12832.55s]  Burnwood. I did it.
[12832.55s -> 12834.55s]  Is untouchable.
[12834.55s -> 12838.58s]  I was
[12838.58s -> 12870.57s]  the carrot all along. Oh I did it.
[12874.34s -> 12878.18s]  I don't understand the big reveal
[12878.18s -> 12880.18s]  there. Did we do that in a previous game?
[12880.18s -> 12882.18s]  Was that like Hitman 1?
[12882.18s -> 12894.22s]  Look at all these people that made this great game.
[12894.22s -> 12896.22s]  Alright. Um. Um. Um.
[12896.22s -> 12903.90s]  Next up.
[12903.90s -> 12905.90s]  Re-plan mission. Re-play
[12905.90s -> 12908.07s]  mission. Exit to menu.
[12908.07s -> 12911.91s]  There's a lot of other things to do.
[12911.91s -> 12914.22s]  Okay. Alright.
[12914.22s -> 12916.22s]  Hold on. Exit to menu. Wait a minute. Hold on a second here.
[12916.22s -> 12919.22s]  Wait a minute. Hold on.
[12919.22s -> 12929.98s]  Hold on here. Hold on a minute here.
[12929.98s -> 12956.20s]  What is this? That's the
[12956.20s -> 12958.20s]  DLC. Ah. From Hitman 1.
[12958.20s -> 12965.88s]  What else? Okay. This is sniper
[12965.88s -> 12967.88s]  assassin mode. And then there's also ghost
[12967.88s -> 12970.95s]  mode. I didn't
[12970.95s -> 12972.95s]  even do this. Single player.
[12972.95s -> 12977.43s]  What is this? Oh this is like
[12977.43s -> 12980.63s]  the demo isn't it?
[12980.63s -> 12982.63s]  Welcome to Austria.
[12982.63s -> 12984.63s]  Agent 47. Your targets are Dorian
[12984.63s -> 12986.63s]  Lang, Guillaume Maison
[12986.63s -> 12988.63s]  and Doris Lee. Three remaining
[12988.63s -> 12990.63s]  members of the international gang of thieves
[12990.63s -> 12992.63s]  known as the Yardbirds. The multiplayer is in beta?
[12992.63s -> 12994.63s]  The Yardbirds were famous for the daring
[12994.63s -> 12996.63s]  heists. In particular, one that
[12996.63s -> 12998.63s]  took place against Chamal Casino in Las
[12998.63s -> 13000.63s]  Vegas. I- That's where I live!
[13000.63s -> 13002.63s]  To be the property of organized criminals
[13002.63s -> 13004.63s]  who in turn launched a campaign of violence
[13004.63s -> 13006.63s]  and retaliation in an effort to
[13006.63s -> 13008.63s]  identify the thieves and find
[13008.63s -> 13010.63s]  the money. Feeling the earth burn beneath
[13010.63s -> 13012.63s]  them, the Yardbirds entered into
[13012.63s -> 13014.63s]  a secret agreement. The treasure would
[13014.63s -> 13016.63s]  remain hidden and once the dust settled
[13016.63s -> 13018.63s]  the last remaining member was to
[13018.63s -> 13020.63s]  inherit everything.
[13020.63s -> 13022.63s]  The group retired and all members vanished
[13022.63s -> 13024.63s]  from sight until Calvin Ritter
[13024.63s -> 13026.63s]  the Sparrow was found dead
[13026.63s -> 13028.63s]  on his yacht. But the remaining
[13028.63s -> 13030.63s]  members remained elusive.
[13030.63s -> 13032.94s]  The group never gathers
[13032.94s -> 13034.94s]  in one place but today
[13034.94s -> 13036.94s]  is a special occasion.
[13036.94s -> 13038.94s]  The owl's birthday!
[13062.94s -> 13065.56s]  Alright, eliminate
[13065.56s -> 13067.56s]  everybody. I didn't do this.
[13067.56s -> 13074.41s]  Kill them all.
[13074.41s -> 13078.50s]  Agent and Mastery. Agent 47.
[13078.50s -> 13080.50s]  Sure.
[13080.50s -> 13082.50s]  C...
[13082.50s -> 13086.41s]  Extended mag level 2. Alright,
[13086.41s -> 13091.59s]  level up?
[13091.59s -> 13102.22s]  Let's do it.
[13108.22s -> 13110.22s]  Oh.
[13112.22s -> 13114.22s]  So, is the multiplayer
[13114.22s -> 13116.22s]  like available right now?
[13116.22s -> 13118.22s]  I'll try, I would try it.
[13132.22s -> 13134.22s]  It's Battle Royale.
[13134.22s -> 13136.22s]  No, it is not, is it?
[13140.22s -> 13142.22s]  It's a Battle Royale.
[13142.22s -> 13144.22s]  I don't believe that.
[13183.94s -> 13185.94s]  Alright, let's do it.
[13185.94s -> 13190.04s]  So we got guy in the window,
[13190.04s -> 13192.04s]  people showing up by car.
[13192.04s -> 13203.62s]  Just wait till they all get to the ceremony.
[13203.62s -> 13205.62s]  He's in the car, he's in the window.
[13205.62s -> 13213.24s]  This is the mobile game.
[13213.24s -> 13217.59s]  It's a flash game.
[13217.59s -> 13222.01s]  This was the teaser though,
[13222.01s -> 13233.66s]  wasn't it?
[13233.66s -> 13235.66s]  Wasn't this the precursor to Hitman 2
[13235.66s -> 13241.86s]  releasing? I think I can handle it.
[13241.86s -> 13244.55s]  Once he gets close enough I'll try to take out
[13244.55s -> 13249.67s]  1, 2, 3. Just play
[13249.67s -> 13251.67s]  the stickman sniper game.
[13251.67s -> 13253.67s]  Oh my god, that's a long time ago.
[13253.67s -> 13256.36s]  Alright, where is he?
[13258.60s -> 13260.60s]  The Kingfisher.
[13260.60s -> 13262.60s]  Former Interpol agent and the owner of
[13262.60s -> 13270.02s]  the mansion and its grounds.
[13270.02s -> 13272.02s]  So who is this then?
[13272.02s -> 13274.02s]  That is Doris Lee, aka
[13274.02s -> 13276.02s]  the Goldfinch.
[13276.02s -> 13278.02s]  Former Hollywood stunt woman of Cheyenne descent.
[13284.55s -> 13286.55s]  That is Dorian Lang, the Red Robin.
[13286.55s -> 13288.55s]  Former military engineer
[13288.55s -> 13290.55s]  and father of the bride.
[13290.55s -> 13292.55s]  47, the situation is about
[13292.55s -> 13294.55s]  to become critical. Lang is down.
[13294.55s -> 13296.55s]  Nice work 47.
[13296.55s -> 13298.55s]  Lee has been eliminated.
[13298.55s -> 13302.26s]  Good work 47.
[13302.26s -> 13307.83s]  47, an alarm went off.
[13307.83s -> 13309.83s]  They're evacuating.
[13309.83s -> 13327.75s]  Oh shit, I got a bridesmaid.
[13327.75s -> 13329.75s]  Oh fuck.
[13329.75s -> 13331.75s]  No.
[13331.75s -> 13338.15s]  There they go.
[13338.15s -> 13340.65s]  Nice work 47.
[13384.28s -> 13397.98s]  Nice long jump.
[13397.98s -> 13399.98s]  They're just shooting up here.
[13399.98s -> 13405.35s]  Nobody can hit me. Oh my god,
[13405.35s -> 13409.26s]  this sensitivity. Wait, DPI.
[13409.26s -> 13411.43s]  One, two, three. DPI up.
[13411.43s -> 13477.67s]  Someone's getting away. Someone's getting away.
[13477.67s -> 13541.21s]  Yes.
[13541.21s -> 13547.10s]  Nice work 47.
[13547.10s -> 13560.01s]  That was fun, I guess.
[13560.01s -> 13571.53s]  There's so many ways to do that.
[13571.53s -> 13576.01s]  Now do ghost mode. Yeah, okay.
[13576.01s -> 13580.10s]  Oh my DPI.
[13580.10s -> 13582.10s]  Alright, let's try the multiplayer.
[13582.10s -> 13591.88s]  Let's see what it's like. Ghost mode.
[13591.88s -> 13598.31s]  Okay. Briefing.
[13598.31s -> 13600.31s]  Eliminate targets to gain points
[13600.31s -> 13605.43s]  and beat your opponent. Find opponent.
[13605.43s -> 13608.57s]  Quick match. Game rules.
[13608.57s -> 13610.57s]  I kind of need to know what the hell happens here.
[13624.94s -> 13626.94s]  Are we in the same game?
[13626.94s -> 13628.94s]  The first player with five eliminations
[13628.94s -> 13630.94s]  is the winner. Targets are
[13630.94s -> 13632.94s]  randomly selected every time
[13632.94s -> 13634.94s]  so no duel will be the same.
[13634.94s -> 13636.94s]  Since you start off with no equipment
[13636.94s -> 13638.94s]  you'll need to improvise.
[13638.94s -> 13640.94s]  Find ghost crates and grab
[13640.94s -> 13642.94s]  disguises as you go. Can we see
[13642.94s -> 13644.94s]  each other? If your opponent scores a kill
[13644.94s -> 13646.94s]  you'll have limited time to react.
[13646.94s -> 13648.94s]  Will you risk blowing
[13648.94s -> 13650.94s]  your cover? Be careful.
[13650.94s -> 13652.94s]  A spotted kill does not count.
[13652.94s -> 13654.94s]  Does not count?
[13654.94s -> 13656.94s]  You exist in separate realities.
[13656.94s -> 13658.94s]  So a messy, chaotic
[13658.94s -> 13660.94s]  approach on your end
[13660.94s -> 13662.94s]  does not affect your opponent.
[13662.94s -> 13664.94s]  Quite the contrary. While you're
[13664.94s -> 13666.94s]  busy cleaning up or running for your life
[13666.94s -> 13668.94s]  your opponent is free to advance
[13668.94s -> 13670.94s]  like a ghost. Be cunning,
[13670.94s -> 13672.94s]  be creative, be ruthless.
[13672.94s -> 13674.94s]  Good luck.
[13674.94s -> 13676.94s]  That's kind of unfortunate.
[13676.94s -> 13680.90s]  I guess you kind of have to do something like
[13680.90s -> 13682.90s]  that though. Because
[13682.90s -> 13685.72s]  how would you ever do this?
[13685.72s -> 13687.72s]  Somebody would just throw grenades
[13687.72s -> 13692.20s]  and it would just ruin everything.
[13692.20s -> 13694.20s]  Alright, I'm going up against
[13694.20s -> 13711.67s]  Coca-Cola.
[13711.67s -> 13713.67s]  It would just be a cesspool game mode.
[13713.67s -> 13720.01s]  Yeah, it wouldn't work.
[13720.01s -> 13722.01s]  It'd be fun to do something like
[13722.01s -> 13724.01s]  that Assassin's Creed
[13724.01s -> 13726.01s]  game mode where
[13726.01s -> 13728.01s]  it was a game that I played where you hit around
[13728.01s -> 13730.01s]  and you had to get... Can we actually see each other though?
[13732.01s -> 13734.01s]  I guess we can see each other.
[13739.83s -> 13742.14s]  Don't orcs. Anything can still happen.
[13742.14s -> 13758.78s]  Your opponent is now
[13758.78s -> 13767.99s]  disguised.
[13767.99s -> 13796.09s]  Silent takedown.
[13796.09s -> 13803.69s]  You're following me.
[13803.69s -> 13805.69s]  Why are we the same target?
[13813.35s -> 13815.98s]  I got it before he did.
[13815.98s -> 13817.98s]  What's going on?
[13817.98s -> 13822.52s]  Next target in 10 seconds.
[13824.52s -> 13826.52s]  Hold on. So it's just a race
[13826.52s -> 13828.52s]  to get to the guy?
[13828.52s -> 13830.52s]  Okay, this is way cooler.
[13830.52s -> 13832.52s]  This is not...
[13832.52s -> 13836.04s]  New target. Find
[13836.04s -> 13839.62s]  and eliminate. Good news.
[13839.62s -> 13841.62s]  Your opponent died.
[13841.62s -> 13848.28s]  Your opponent is back
[13848.28s -> 13850.28s]  in the fight.
[13850.28s -> 13853.03s]  Good news.
[13853.03s -> 13869.59s]  Wait, is he upstairs?
[13869.59s -> 13881.42s]  Damn it.
[13881.42s -> 13891.08s]  Good news. Wait, is he down?
[13893.08s -> 13902.22s]  What the fuck?
[13902.22s -> 13904.22s]  Go!
[13904.22s -> 13915.74s]  Go over it!
[13915.74s -> 13929.50s]  Your opponent killed the target.
[13929.50s -> 13933.34s]  Warning. Target
[13933.34s -> 13937.30s]  will be lost in 15 seconds.
[13937.30s -> 13939.30s]  Target lost.
[13939.30s -> 13941.30s]  Oh, okay. I get it.
[13941.30s -> 13943.30s]  I get it. I get it.
[13943.30s -> 13945.30s]  I get it. I understand.
[13945.30s -> 13947.30s]  Wait a minute.
[13947.30s -> 13949.30s]  I understand.
[13949.30s -> 13951.30s]  So it doesn't matter.
[13951.30s -> 13953.30s]  I get it.
[13953.30s -> 13955.30s]  So wait, why did
[13955.30s -> 13957.30s]  Why does he only have one
[13957.30s -> 13959.30s]  point?
[13959.30s -> 13961.30s]  Where's his point?
[13961.30s -> 13963.30s]  I don't get it.
[13963.30s -> 13965.86s]  How come he doesn't have a point right now?
[13965.86s -> 13967.86s]  Because I killed it in time?
[13967.86s -> 13974.20s]  He got noticed too? Okay.
[13974.20s -> 13977.78s]  When does this end?
[13977.78s -> 13983.74s]  Your opponent changed disguise.
[13983.74s -> 13995.96s]  Your opponent changed disguise.
[13997.96s -> 14004.36s]  Where is this dude?
[14004.36s -> 14006.36s]  Is he down?
[14006.36s -> 14008.36s]  He is down.
[14008.36s -> 14010.36s]  He is down. He's in the garage.
[14016.36s -> 14018.36s]  Okay.
[14018.36s -> 14020.36s]  I gotta get down to the garage.
[14022.36s -> 14026.26s]  I gotta go down the stairs.
[14026.26s -> 14028.26s]  Neither one of us can get him
[14028.26s -> 14030.26s]  apparently.
[14040.26s -> 14042.26s]  No!
[14044.50s -> 14046.50s]  Damn it!
[14070.15s -> 14072.15s]  I'm not even changing disguise.
[14072.15s -> 14077.78s]  It has to be a stealth kill.
[14077.78s -> 14079.78s]  That's right.
[14079.78s -> 14082.28s]  Alright. I got the jump on this one.
[14082.28s -> 14084.28s]  He's up there.
[14098.26s -> 14100.26s]  We'll see.
[14100.26s -> 14102.26s]  What's this?
[14122.33s -> 14124.33s]  Target eliminated.
[14124.33s -> 14130.79s]  He's in a bird costume.
[14130.79s -> 14135.51s]  Clean kill.
[14135.51s -> 14137.51s]  Score two to one.
[14137.51s -> 14139.51s]  Wait. Give me that costume.
[14139.51s -> 14141.51s]  Score two to two.
[14141.51s -> 14143.51s]  Two to two?
[14143.51s -> 14145.51s]  Your opponent just picked up additional
[14145.51s -> 14147.51s]  equipment.
[14147.51s -> 14149.51s]  Where did he get the extra point from?
[14149.51s -> 14151.51s]  Three, two, one.
[14151.51s -> 14154.33s]  New target.
[14154.33s -> 14156.33s]  Find and eliminate.
[14156.33s -> 14159.34s]  Pool ball?
[14159.34s -> 14164.39s]  Alright. I got a pool ball.
[14164.39s -> 14166.70s]  What was the extra point?
[14166.70s -> 14173.54s]  I can't go this way.
[14173.54s -> 14178.47s]  Yeah. We both killed the same guy though.
[14178.47s -> 14195.94s]  Let me just disguise. Come on.
[14195.94s -> 14198.63s]  Prime noticed by somebody.
[14198.63s -> 14202.73s]  Who the fuck saw it?
[14202.73s -> 14207.40s]  Oh. Fuck you.
[14207.40s -> 14222.42s]  Oh well.
[14222.42s -> 14224.42s]  I'm still...
[14224.42s -> 14226.42s]  What is happening here?
[14226.42s -> 14229.56s]  Get out of the way.
[14229.56s -> 14233.02s]  What the fuck are you...
[14233.02s -> 14235.02s]  Your opponent just picked up a weapon.
[14235.02s -> 14246.79s]  I can't vault over that.
[14246.79s -> 14248.79s]  Oh my goodness.
[14248.79s -> 14250.79s]  I can't vault over that either.
[14250.79s -> 14254.06s]  I can't unlock that. Shit.
[14261.24s -> 14263.24s]  I gotta go down.
[14263.24s -> 14267.91s]  I gotta go down. I gotta go down. I gotta go down.
[14267.91s -> 14282.70s]  I have no items.
[14282.70s -> 14289.22s]  Snap his neck. Frame rate.
[14289.22s -> 14291.22s]  Why?
[14291.22s -> 14305.61s]  Is there anything in here?
[14305.61s -> 14307.61s]  Score three to two.
[14307.61s -> 14309.78s]  What the fuck is happening?
[14309.78s -> 14311.78s]  What are you talking about?
[14311.78s -> 14313.78s]  All even.
[14313.78s -> 14315.78s]  Move carefully. Five.
[14315.78s -> 14317.78s]  Four. Your opponent
[14317.78s -> 14319.78s]  just picked up additional equipment.
[14319.78s -> 14321.78s]  New target.
[14321.78s -> 14323.78s]  Find and eliminate.
[14323.78s -> 14329.74s]  I'm in the game too?
[14329.74s -> 14331.74s]  He's up. He's this way. Up or...
[14331.74s -> 14345.11s]  I'm secure though.
[14345.11s -> 14361.88s]  I should be fine.
[14361.88s -> 14363.88s]  Your opponent changed disguise.
[14363.88s -> 14367.40s]  Your opponent just
[14367.40s -> 14369.40s]  picked up additional equipment.
[14369.40s -> 14378.15s]  This is where I take the lead.
[14378.15s -> 14380.15s]  Right here. This is where I take the lead.
[14380.15s -> 14392.50s]  Did I not get it?
[14392.50s -> 14395.77s]  Your kill was
[14395.77s -> 14397.77s]  witnessed. Fucking god damn it.
[14397.77s -> 14399.77s]  Let me just repeat some ground rules
[14399.77s -> 14401.77s]  for those of you new...
[14401.77s -> 14403.77s]  What?
[14403.77s -> 14405.77s]  I lost a point for that. I lost...
[14405.77s -> 14407.77s]  Two to three.
[14407.77s -> 14409.77s]  How did he see me do that?
[14409.77s -> 14411.77s]  Five. Four.
[14411.77s -> 14413.77s]  Three. Good news.
[14413.77s -> 14415.77s]  Your opponent died.
[14415.77s -> 14417.77s]  New target. Find
[14417.77s -> 14419.77s]  and eliminate. So that's what happened.
[14419.77s -> 14421.77s]  That's what happened to him.
[14421.77s -> 14423.77s]  Your opponent is back in the fight.
[14423.77s -> 14425.77s]  Oh my fucking god.
[14425.77s -> 14427.77s]  One to three.
[14427.77s -> 14432.95s]  Your opponent changed disguise.
[14432.95s -> 14434.95s]  Just get me out of
[14434.95s -> 14441.03s]  the game already.
[14441.03s -> 14443.46s]  He's gonna win.
[14443.46s -> 14445.46s]  If you kill somebody that's not
[14445.46s -> 14447.46s]  the target you lose a full point.
[14447.46s -> 14450.22s]  That's a rage quit right there.
[14450.22s -> 14452.22s]  Like what the fuck?
[14452.22s -> 14454.22s]  Guy gets behind and the security camera sees
[14454.22s -> 14457.42s]  me. That's why I got compromised.
[14457.42s -> 14473.93s]  That's bullshit.
[14473.93s -> 14475.93s]  Why would you even give this to me?
[14475.93s -> 14477.93s]  How the hell are you supposed to use this without being seen?
[14477.93s -> 14491.24s]  Don't retaliate.
[14491.24s -> 14493.24s]  You'll lose points.
[14493.24s -> 14502.78s]  Back in the fight.
[14502.78s -> 14506.87s]  Careful. Your enemy
[14506.87s -> 14512.06s]  will still recognize you.
[14512.06s -> 14514.06s]  You are losing. Assert yourself.
[14514.06s -> 14516.06s]  I had a chance and then I threw it away.
[14516.06s -> 14518.06s]  Score. One to four.
[14518.06s -> 14520.06s]  Your opponent has almost won.
[14520.06s -> 14522.06s]  Good. I hope he wins.
[14522.06s -> 14524.06s]  I would have won the game too.
[14524.06s -> 14526.06s]  Seven. Six.
[14526.06s -> 14528.06s]  Five. Four.
[14528.06s -> 14530.06s]  Three. Two.
[14530.06s -> 14532.55s]  One.
[14532.55s -> 14534.55s]  New target. Find and
[14534.55s -> 14540.18s]  eliminate.
[14540.18s -> 14544.34s]  Just kill me.
[14544.34s -> 14546.71s]  Just go win.
[14546.71s -> 14548.71s]  Your opponent changed disguise.
[14548.71s -> 14554.41s]  Let me open the door for you.
[14554.41s -> 14561.58s]  I'll go scout it out up here.
[14561.58s -> 14563.58s]  Your opponent just picked up additional
[14563.58s -> 14566.52s]  equipment.
[14566.52s -> 14575.91s]  I hope he uses it well.
[14575.91s -> 14577.91s]  Use some assistance here.
[14577.91s -> 14585.66s]  Your opponent just picked up
[14585.66s -> 14587.66s]  additional equipment.
[14587.66s -> 14589.66s]  I don't see how this works. I have no items.
[14589.66s -> 14595.99s]  I'm not allowed to be in here.
[14595.99s -> 14597.99s]  If it's a camera, I swear to God.
[14597.99s -> 14614.04s]  Knock him off.
[14614.04s -> 14616.04s]  Why would they give you guns like this?
[14616.04s -> 14620.84s]  I want to see what happens if I do this.
[14620.84s -> 14622.84s]  Target eliminated. Your kill was witnessed.
[14622.84s -> 14626.73s]  Target. Score.
[14626.73s -> 14628.73s]  Zero to four.
[14628.73s -> 14634.09s]  Nine. Six.
[14634.09s -> 14636.09s]  Five. Four.
[14636.09s -> 14638.09s]  Three. Two.
[14638.09s -> 14640.09s]  One.
[14640.09s -> 14643.10s]  Target. Score. Zero
[14643.10s -> 14645.10s]  to four.
[14645.10s -> 14648.74s]  You just kill him. He's in there.
[14648.74s -> 14650.74s]  Is there a forfeit button?
[14658.36s -> 14663.46s]  Just exit.
[14663.46s -> 14670.50s]  Congratulations, you won.
[14670.50s -> 14672.50s]  It just quit me out of the whole game.
[14672.50s -> 14676.98s]  It's updating now.
[14676.98s -> 14678.98s]  I have an update to download.
[14678.98s -> 14684.04s]  Why is this the second time this has done this?
[14684.04s -> 14693.26s]  No, I was doing fine.
[14693.26s -> 14695.26s]  That's the first time I've even seen
[14695.26s -> 14697.26s]  that game mode, first of all. Second of all,
[14697.26s -> 14699.43s]  killing somebody that's not a target,
[14699.43s -> 14701.43s]  you lose a full point.
[14701.43s -> 14704.38s]  Is that their way to make it so you
[14704.38s -> 14706.38s]  never don't ever do anything bad?
[14706.38s -> 14708.74s]  Is that like the anti-grief
[14708.74s -> 14710.74s]  to make it so you just go to zero and you just lose
[14710.74s -> 14712.74s]  if you shoot somebody that's not a guy that you need
[14712.74s -> 14720.42s]  to go after?
[14720.42s -> 14722.42s]  Because if you play into five points, losing one point
[14722.42s -> 14724.42s]  is a total disaster.
[14724.42s -> 14726.92s]  It's a complete disaster.
[14726.92s -> 14733.06s]  Only play into five,
[14733.06s -> 14735.75s]  then the only way you can get a point
[14735.75s -> 14743.62s]  you'll never make it to Hitman 2 Nationals.
[14743.62s -> 14746.18s]  I want to try that again,
[14746.18s -> 14769.29s]  now knowing that that's going to happen.
[14769.29s -> 14771.29s]  Guns exist to stop someone else from getting
[14771.29s -> 14773.29s]  a point if you don't have time to get unnoticed
[14773.29s -> 14775.29s]  and kill.
[14775.29s -> 14780.47s]  But wouldn't you lose a point?
[14780.47s -> 14785.98s]  So you shoot the guy
[14785.98s -> 14790.65s]  from far away,
[14790.65s -> 14795.06s]  not if they're the target.
[14795.06s -> 14797.06s]  But that makes it so they can't
[14797.06s -> 14799.06s]  get the point. But wouldn't that person be
[14799.06s -> 14801.06s]  alive in their mode?
[14801.06s -> 14803.06s]  I thought it was like
[14803.06s -> 14811.96s]  separate realities.
[14811.96s -> 14813.96s]  You can't get to him in 20 seconds.
[14813.96s -> 14815.96s]  Alright, let's do it again. Let's try it again.
[14815.96s -> 14830.15s]  But how did he
[14830.15s -> 14844.42s]  get two points?
[14844.42s -> 14846.42s]  Because he had two points at one time after one person.
[14846.42s -> 14848.98s]  He got a
[14848.98s -> 14863.19s]  costume bonus?
[14863.19s -> 14865.19s]  No, that's not even real.
[14865.19s -> 14876.97s]  There's no costume bonus.
[14876.97s -> 14893.74s]  There's a syncing issue? Oh.
[14893.74s -> 14896.17s]  Okay, let's try this again.
[14900.17s -> 14902.17s]  Who the hell are we?
[14910.34s -> 14913.10s]  Alright, what do we got here?
[14913.10s -> 14915.10s]  Um,
[14915.10s -> 14917.10s]  crowbar break.
[14917.10s -> 14919.10s]  I'll take it.
[14919.10s -> 14921.10s]  Wait, where'd you get that disguised?
[14928.41s -> 14936.92s]  He's waiting for me.
[14936.92s -> 14938.92s]  He's
[14938.92s -> 14940.92s]  waiting for me. That was so
[14940.92s -> 14944.25s]  nice of you.
[14944.25s -> 14950.71s]  He's like, okay, you ready? Alright.
[14998.31s -> 15006.89s]  I'm actually in the co-op mode.
[15008.89s -> 15011.90s]  Do you think
[15011.90s -> 15013.90s]  or I mean
[15013.90s -> 15016.84s]  what?
[15016.84s -> 15021.45s]  Target eliminated.
[15021.45s -> 15029.51s]  Your kill was witnessed.
[15029.51s -> 15031.51s]  Next target in 10 seconds.
[15031.51s -> 15034.26s]  Your opponent
[15034.26s -> 15036.26s]  killed the target.
[15036.26s -> 15038.26s]  And nobody noticed it?
[15038.26s -> 15040.26s]  Nobody noticed his kill?
[15040.26s -> 15042.89s]  No, he's like running around
[15042.89s -> 15054.34s]  punching people.
[15054.34s -> 15057.22s]  He didn't use a brick.
[15057.22s -> 15059.22s]  Well, he got noticed.
[15059.22s -> 15061.22s]  What's going on here? Who's firing?
[15066.73s -> 15084.63s]  Coming up here? Nope.
[15084.63s -> 15086.63s]  This is not a bathroom. I thought this was a bathroom.
[15099.86s -> 15102.74s]  What do we got? Ghost coin.
[15111.38s -> 15113.38s]  Uh, are we both not killing him?
[15115.38s -> 15117.38s]  I don't think this is... Where are you coming from?
[15117.38s -> 15119.38s]  Get out of here!
[15119.38s -> 15121.38s]  Five. Four.
[15121.38s -> 15123.38s]  Three. Two.
[15123.38s -> 15125.38s]  One.
[15125.38s -> 15127.38s]  There's like too much going on here.
[15127.38s -> 15130.46s]  Find and eliminate.
[15130.46s -> 15136.54s]  Opponent changed disguise.
[15140.50s -> 15142.87s]  Alright, well it's zero to zero.
[15142.87s -> 15144.87s]  Back in the fight.
[15144.87s -> 15146.87s]  Careful. Your enemy will still recognize you.
[15151.08s -> 15158.50s]  Alright, so when you...
[15158.50s -> 15160.50s]  I'm automatically just still...
[15160.50s -> 15162.50s]  I don't get to start over.
[15162.50s -> 15164.50s]  I'm out in combat still.
[15164.50s -> 15172.25s]  Yeah, I know she just said that
[15172.25s -> 15174.25s]  but that's still like where the fuck am I supposed to go?
[15174.25s -> 15176.25s]  Careful. Your enemy will still recognize you.
[15176.25s -> 15178.25s]  I'm still hunted.
[15178.25s -> 15180.25s]  So I'll just pull the guy in the fucking tank top
[15180.25s -> 15182.25s]  aside and take his tank top?
[15182.25s -> 15186.02s]  I can't even take his disguise.
[15186.02s -> 15200.23s]  I need a disguise.
[15202.23s -> 15204.23s]  He'd want to do better this time.
[15204.23s -> 15206.23s]  Your opponent just picked up a weapon.
[15210.33s -> 15212.33s]  I can't take that guy's clothes.
[15212.33s -> 15215.34s]  There is still some time to go.
[15220.39s -> 15222.39s]  Your opponent just picked up additional equipment.
[15222.39s -> 15229.42s]  Wow.
[15229.42s -> 15231.42s]  Jumped by this other man.
[15231.42s -> 15233.42s]  The upper down, he's down.
[15233.42s -> 15235.42s]  I need a disguise.
[15235.42s -> 15237.42s]  Your opponent killed the target.
[15237.42s -> 15239.42s]  God, I'm gonna lose.
[15245.88s -> 15247.88s]  You are losing. Assert yourself.
[15247.88s -> 15249.88s]  Okay.
[15249.88s -> 15251.88s]  Score zero to one.
[15251.88s -> 15253.88s]  I'll assert myself.
[15253.88s -> 15255.88s]  Target will be lost in ten seconds.
[15255.88s -> 15257.88s]  Anybody here? What? Hold on.
[15257.88s -> 15259.88s]  Your opponent just picked up additional equipment.
[15259.88s -> 15262.31s]  Five, four, three.
[15262.31s -> 15264.31s]  Target lost.
[15264.31s -> 15266.31s]  Target eliminated.
[15266.31s -> 15268.31s]  New target.
[15268.31s -> 15270.31s]  Find and eliminate.
[15270.31s -> 15272.31s]  I don't even want to play this anymore.
[15277.11s -> 15279.11s]  I don't think this is very fun.
[15279.11s -> 15281.11s]  I really don't.
[15281.11s -> 15283.11s]  All even.
[15283.11s -> 15285.29s]  Your opponent changed disguise.
[15285.29s -> 15291.69s]  Back in the fight.
[15291.69s -> 15293.69s]  Careful. Your enemy will still recognize you.
[15293.69s -> 15295.69s]  Yeah, I know.
[15295.69s -> 15306.57s]  So I...
[15306.57s -> 15308.57s]  Oh my fucking god.
[15308.57s -> 15312.54s]  This is the same outfit.
[15312.54s -> 15314.54s]  It's the same guy.
[15314.54s -> 15318.76s]  You are losing.
[15318.76s -> 15320.76s]  Assert yourself.
[15320.76s -> 15322.76s]  That just hit me. I just killed me.
[15322.76s -> 15337.42s]  Score zero to one.
[15337.42s -> 15340.55s]  I don't know where to put him.
[15340.55s -> 15351.05s]  Someone's gonna come in here.
[15351.05s -> 15353.29s]  Gotta go up.
[15353.29s -> 15362.44s]  Can I get up through here?
[15362.44s -> 15379.27s]  I don't have any items.
[15379.27s -> 15381.27s]  I need to find something to kill him with silently.
[15381.27s -> 15396.25s]  Christ.
[15396.25s -> 15398.25s]  Oh god.
[15398.25s -> 15405.67s]  Give me a break.
[15405.67s -> 15407.67s]  You can't be here, sir.
[15407.67s -> 15414.20s]  Your opponent changed disguise.
[15416.82s -> 15419.83s]  Yeah, I have a mini...
[15419.83s -> 15421.83s]  I know I have a minimap, but I have to find something.
[15421.83s -> 15423.83s]  Back in the fight.
[15423.83s -> 15425.83s]  Careful.
[15425.83s -> 15428.07s]  I hate it. I don't want to play it anymore.
[15428.07s -> 15454.23s]  I hate that.
[15454.23s -> 15456.54s]  I can't do this?
[15456.54s -> 15466.71s]  No. Do the patch notes.
[15466.71s -> 15476.76s]  I want to do this.
[15476.76s -> 15488.39s]  I'm gonna go back to here.
[15488.39s -> 15490.76s]  I understood how it all worked.
[15490.76s -> 15493.13s]  It just seems like...
[15493.13s -> 15500.54s]  I don't know. I just don't...
[15500.54s -> 15503.35s]  I didn't like it at all.
[15503.35s -> 15513.19s]  There's more multiplayer? What?
[15513.19s -> 15530.15s]  This is the only one that's here.
[15530.15s -> 15532.15s]  I already did the sniper mode.
[15538.10s -> 15540.10s]  I know I'm not a great hitman player,
[15540.10s -> 15546.38s]  but I just want to scream right now
[15546.38s -> 15548.38s]  about how much I hate that fucking game mode.
[15548.38s -> 15551.45s]  I just want to yell it as loud as I can.
[15551.45s -> 15568.15s]  All right.
[15568.15s -> 15571.10s]  Create a contract.
[15571.10s -> 15575.51s]  Contract search. Trending.
[15575.51s -> 15581.19s]  Easy. With a heart.
[15581.19s -> 15585.48s]  Let's do easy.
[15585.48s -> 15593.59s]  Easy. By salt.
[15593.59s -> 15609.77s]  This one's trending.
[15609.77s -> 15612.01s]  Eliminate Christopher May.
[15612.01s -> 15626.58s]  All right.
[15626.58s -> 15634.52s]  Are you serious?
[15634.52s -> 15636.52s]  That's it. Okay.
[15636.52s -> 15638.52s]  That's it. Just shoot him and hit the button.
[15641.85s -> 15643.85s]  Is this what you wanted?
[15643.85s -> 15649.93s]  How do I get a two-star?
[15649.93s -> 15651.93s]  Hold on. I'm gonna replay this mission.
[15651.93s -> 15654.10s]  Let's get a five-star on easy.
[15665.10s -> 15668.94s]  So what do I have for items?
[15668.94s -> 15670.94s]  Just fiberwire? Okay.
[15670.94s -> 15673.94s]  So I'm gonna coin this guy
[15673.94s -> 15682.90s]  and fiberwire him.
[15682.90s -> 15685.59s]  I'm so...
[15685.59s -> 15687.59s]  I'm so tilted right now.
[15687.59s -> 15689.59s]  From that fucking multiplayer mode.
[15689.59s -> 15700.15s]  I just need like a stress ball
[15700.15s -> 15702.15s]  to bite him with my teeth.
[15743.10s -> 15774.63s]  I think I have to stop playing.
[15774.63s -> 15776.63s]  I have to stop playing. I'm so...
[15776.63s -> 15780.47s]  Oh my god.
[15803.64s -> 15807.02s]  All right. I gotta get ready for tomorrow.
[15835.54s -> 15837.54s]  Oh, I'm so upset.
[15837.54s -> 15851.56s]  So tomorrow is the
[15851.56s -> 15854.50s]  green screen stream.
[15854.50s -> 15865.70s]  That should be a lot of fun. Tomorrow afternoon.
[15865.70s -> 15877.03s]  Why not some more ghost mode?
[15877.03s -> 15880.62s]  No, I'm never opening that ever again.
[15880.62s -> 15885.48s]  I really don't know what time.
[15885.48s -> 15891.43s]  I think it's kind of whenever
[15891.43s -> 15893.43s]  I want to start it, I think.
[15893.43s -> 15897.66s]  But actually, let's do this now.
[15897.66s -> 15899.66s]  Yeah, I'm out of here.
[15899.66s -> 15909.13s]  Because there are some things I need to do.
[15909.13s -> 15911.13s]  And I'm going to freak out
[15911.13s -> 15913.88s]  if I don't get out of here.
[15913.88s -> 15926.23s]  Like this game.
[15926.23s -> 15928.23s]  Why would they put that in the options menu?
[15928.23s -> 15937.75s]  Anyways.
[15937.75s -> 15939.75s]  Let me get this back to you guys.
[15939.75s -> 15942.12s]  Tomorrow, probably around
[15942.12s -> 15944.12s]  let's see, 1, 2, 3, 4.
[15944.12s -> 15946.12s]  I'm going to try
[15946.12s -> 15948.12s]  I'm assuming it's going to happen around 12 or 1 Pacific.
[15948.12s -> 15952.66s]  So.
[15952.66s -> 15954.66s]  Probably around 3 to 4 Eastern is when it's going to start.
[15954.66s -> 15961.90s]  I had a poll. Might as well show it
[15961.90s -> 15966.76s]  one more time.
[15966.76s -> 15968.76s]  One of the mods
[15968.76s -> 15972.09s]  have that poll for the memes.
[15972.09s -> 15976.30s]  Because I
[15976.30s -> 15978.30s]  have it somewhere here. It just would take me a minute to find it.
[15978.30s -> 15981.94s]  There it is.
[15981.94s -> 15983.94s]  So, there were a lot of responses.
[15983.94s -> 15988.73s]  Take a look there.
[15988.73s -> 15990.73s]  And it looks like
[15990.73s -> 16001.42s]  I'll leave this open for like 5 minutes.
[16001.42s -> 16003.42s]  It looks like
[16003.42s -> 16005.42s]  the top 3 are JoJoPose's
[16005.42s -> 16007.91s]  CSI Sunglass
[16007.91s -> 16009.91s]  One-liners and Infinity War stuff.
[16009.91s -> 16013.94s]  So, I'm going to have to look up
[16013.94s -> 16017.66s]  some of those. I know there's already
[16017.66s -> 16027.96s]  some highly requested ones.
[16027.96s -> 16036.73s]  But, let me see
[16036.73s -> 16045.18s]  here. Yeah, so that's what it's going to be.
[16045.18s -> 16047.42s]  It will be
[16047.42s -> 16052.15s]  these listed here.
[16052.15s -> 16054.15s]  With that, if you want to take off
[16054.15s -> 16057.67s]  I'll see you tomorrow.
[16057.67s -> 16059.67s]  Probably around 4
[16059.67s -> 16061.67s]  to 5 PM Eastern.
[16061.67s -> 16064.94s]  I'd say between
[16064.94s -> 16066.94s]  like 4 and 7 Eastern is
[16066.94s -> 16068.94s]  I'm going to try to start at the typical time.
[16068.94s -> 16074.50s]  I'm trying to think of anything else to
[16074.50s -> 16079.75s]  talk about here before I go.
[16079.75s -> 16081.75s]  I'm just sitting here trying to think.
[16081.75s -> 16089.24s]  Uh, Deltarune.
[16089.24s -> 16091.24s]  I will play Deltarune probably
[16091.24s -> 16093.24s]  at a later date.
[16093.24s -> 16101.16s]  Not right now.
[16101.16s -> 16103.16s]  Because I have to go to
[16103.16s -> 16105.16s]  Best Buy.
[16105.16s -> 16107.16s]  Or Walmart.
[16107.16s -> 16109.16s]  Or Target or something.
[16109.16s -> 16111.16s]  Because there are still like
[16111.16s -> 16113.16s]  at least a couple dozen things that I still
[16113.16s -> 16115.16s]  need. And I need to go while
[16115.16s -> 16121.74s]  they're still open.
[16121.74s -> 16123.74s]  So, I'm not entirely sure
[16123.74s -> 16125.74s]  which one of these stores I'm going to be going to.
[16125.74s -> 16137.32s]  It is a good question.
[16137.32s -> 16144.62s]  Because there's still props that I need.
[16144.62s -> 16147.82s]  I bought some stuff
[16147.82s -> 16149.82s]  but I need... Whoa!
[16149.82s -> 16154.23s]  I'm coming in.
[16154.23s -> 16157.16s]  Thank you to
[16157.16s -> 16159.16s]  Amphiric for the 5 community subs.
[16159.16s -> 16161.78s]  Have some subs before you go.
[16161.78s -> 16167.74s]  Oh, thank you dude.
[16167.74s -> 16170.36s]  Means a lot. Thanks a lot.
[16170.36s -> 16177.27s]  Because the thing that I need to buy
[16177.27s -> 16179.27s]  I was looking at online
[16179.27s -> 16182.92s]  and you
[16182.92s -> 16184.92s]  have to kind of get it at like a Target
[16184.92s -> 16186.92s]  or a Best Buy or something like that.
[16186.92s -> 16188.92s]  I need to see. I know there's like a shitload
[16188.92s -> 16190.92s]  of like Best Buys,
[16190.92s -> 16192.92s]  Walmarts, Targets. They're everywhere around here.
[16192.92s -> 16194.92s]  This is Las Vegas.
[16194.92s -> 16198.95s]  They are fucking everywhere.
[16198.95s -> 16200.95s]  Alright, let's do the bits.
[16200.95s -> 16206.71s]  He's an inflatable microphone.
[16206.71s -> 16212.73s]  Take care everybody.
[16212.73s -> 16215.61s]  See you soon.
[16215.61s -> 16218.62s]  It's time for me to read.
[16218.62s -> 16220.62s]  So, with that, thank you for $3
[16220.62s -> 16225.03s]  to Hasnain. Thanks with 3 bucks.
[16225.03s -> 16227.03s]  Terrible late streamer. Thank you.
[16227.03s -> 16230.68s]  I was a little late today.
[16230.68s -> 16233.62s]  That's right. Thank you Superspy
[16233.62s -> 16238.42s]  Burger Flipper for the $1.
[16238.42s -> 16240.42s]  Hey Jerm, I had a dream last night with you in it.
[16240.42s -> 16242.42s]  You were a guest speaker at some event
[16242.42s -> 16244.42s]  and asked if everyone, if they
[16244.42s -> 16246.42s]  knew you. I jokingly said that I knew you because
[16246.42s -> 16248.42s]  you murdered someone very specific, but then you
[16248.42s -> 16250.42s]  stared to be dead in the face.
[16250.42s -> 16252.66s]  And so if you say that again I'm gonna
[16252.66s -> 16254.66s]  blow your head off.
[16254.66s -> 16257.61s]  Jesus! You still
[16257.61s -> 16260.68s]  had the mic on.
[16260.68s -> 16264.58s]  What the fuck?
[16264.58s -> 16266.58s]  Why are you having that kind of dream about me?
[16266.58s -> 16271.70s]  Thank you so much dude. But
[16271.70s -> 16276.18s]  Jesus. Zero Sue,
[16276.18s -> 16278.18s]  thanks for the $1.50. Thanks for starting the stream
[16278.18s -> 16280.18s]  the second I got home and turned on the tub.
[16280.18s -> 16282.18s]  Too bad I had to kill a lot of rats
[16282.18s -> 16284.18s]  today at work. Sorry to hear that.
[16284.18s -> 16286.18s]  I'm sorry about the rats too.
[16286.18s -> 16291.11s]  But thank you Zero Sue. Thank you Hasnain again
[16291.11s -> 16293.11s]  for a dollar. I have a report for Unium in for tomorrow.
[16293.11s -> 16295.11s]  I've been called to do
[16295.11s -> 16297.11s]  it with
[16297.11s -> 16299.11s]  mates as soon as the stream starts.
[16299.11s -> 16303.53s]  Have fun though. Thank you Hasnain.
[16303.53s -> 16308.14s]  Hey Mad.
[16308.14s -> 16310.14s]  Thank you Mad47 for the $1. Can we expect
[16310.14s -> 16312.14s]  a one on one cage max between Jermis Conscious
[16312.14s -> 16314.14s]  and the chat telling him
[16314.14s -> 16316.14s]  to drown a woman in a toilet
[16316.14s -> 16318.14s]  in the next rumble?
[16318.14s -> 16325.35s]  What? Thank you.
[16325.35s -> 16327.35s]  Thank you GarfieldTheMondayKiller for the $1.
[16327.35s -> 16329.35s]  Jerm, I'm running away from smileydons.
[16329.35s -> 16332.36s]  They're a kind of ancient
[16332.36s -> 16334.36s]  tune tribe. Whoa, that was
[16334.36s -> 16336.98s]  close. Remember how
[16336.98s -> 16338.98s]  you made me your feline ambassador?
[16338.98s -> 16341.29s]  I mean, you
[16341.29s -> 16343.29s]  are. You're the only cat I think that
[16343.29s -> 16345.72s]  watches. Well, the
[16345.72s -> 16347.72s]  Goodwill tour turned sour real
[16347.72s -> 16349.72s]  quick. Just showed them Otto's
[16349.72s -> 16351.72s]  Big Adventure and they flipped out at me.
[16351.72s -> 16353.72s]  You've got no idea how much
[16353.72s -> 16355.72s]  it's been finding a place in this temple with
[16355.72s -> 16358.98s]  Wi-Fi. What the fuck?
[16358.98s -> 16360.98s]  I'm so lost. Thank you Garfield
[16360.98s -> 16363.67s]  for the $1.
[16363.67s -> 16371.22s]  What the fuck? Thank you
[16371.22s -> 16377.69s]  WinceRind for the $3.
[16377.69s -> 16379.69s]  I just finished fall quarter and
[16379.69s -> 16381.69s]  totally nailed my art history exam.
[16381.69s -> 16383.69s]  Yes, I'm paying money to boast about this.
[16383.69s -> 16390.58s]  Congratulations.
[16390.58s -> 16394.30s]  Hopefully you did well. Fall quarter.
[16394.30s -> 16398.07s]  So is the first semester
[16398.07s -> 16400.38s]  college and university
[16400.38s -> 16402.38s]  done?
[16402.38s -> 16404.38s]  Semesters are weird because
[16404.38s -> 16406.38s]  some of them start in September.
[16406.38s -> 16408.38s]  Some start in January, right?
[16408.38s -> 16412.54s]  Midterms, okay. I see.
[16412.54s -> 16414.84s]  Not yet. Okay.
[16414.84s -> 16417.66s]  But congratulations, dude. Thanks a lot for the $3.
[16417.66s -> 16420.15s]  Matty numbers.
[16420.15s -> 16422.15s]  Thanks for the $10 Matty numbers. When are
[16422.15s -> 16424.15s]  you going to finish your Hitman Absolution
[16424.15s -> 16427.10s]  Let's Play? I will
[16427.10s -> 16429.10s]  finish it after doing ghost mode.
[16429.10s -> 16431.10s]  Three more times.
[16431.10s -> 16434.04s]  And the answer to that
[16434.04s -> 16437.88s]  that means it's never happening.
[16437.88s -> 16439.88s]  But thank you for the $10, dude. Appreciate it.
[16439.88s -> 16441.88s]  Flub a gut thanks for the $1.
[16441.88s -> 16443.88s]  Hey Jeremy, you hear about
[16443.88s -> 16445.88s]  Nolan Cassidy. Poor sucker drowned himself
[16445.88s -> 16447.88s]  in his own vomit and put himself in the bathroom
[16447.88s -> 16450.38s]  wardrobe.
[16450.38s -> 16452.62s]  That's fucked up.
[16452.62s -> 16457.29s]  I can't believe that happened.
[16457.29s -> 16459.29s]  Thank you Teetles for the $2.40
[16459.29s -> 16461.29s]  No messages, just thank you, dude.
[16461.29s -> 16463.72s]  Anonymousgifter gave the $10
[16463.72s -> 16465.72s]  community subs
[16465.72s -> 16469.56s]  earlier. Thank you so much, dude.
[16469.56s -> 16473.21s]  That's a lot of community subs.
[16473.21s -> 16476.28s]  Hopefully people
[16476.28s -> 16478.84s]  Is there a way
[16478.84s -> 16480.84s]  to tell? I can see who got them, but
[16480.84s -> 16484.10s]  I wonder
[16484.10s -> 16487.05s]  I wonder what the actual algorithm here is.
[16487.05s -> 16489.22s]  Is it possible just to
[16489.22s -> 16491.22s]  get one if you've already been subscribed?
[16491.22s -> 16493.91s]  I wonder if there's a wait on it.
[16493.91s -> 16497.43s]  Somewhere in the back end.
[16497.43s -> 16499.43s]  So they just show up as regular subs. Okay, that's cool.
[16499.43s -> 16501.43s]  Well, congratulations to everybody and thank you
[16501.43s -> 16503.43s]  for even doing that, man.
[16503.43s -> 16505.43s]  Thanks for the $10. Going through a really hard time right now.
[16505.43s -> 16507.43s]  Thanks for the laughs. Hoping to sub soon.
[16507.43s -> 16510.12s]  Well, you've already paid
[16510.12s -> 16512.74s]  for that sub. Twice here.
[16512.74s -> 16515.43s]  So thank you for even
[16515.43s -> 16518.12s]  considering. Thanks a lot, man.
[16518.12s -> 16520.12s]  Smellyboy, thanks for the $1. Do you think you'd be able
[16520.12s -> 16522.12s]  to fight off a man your size
[16522.12s -> 16524.12s]  but with more ambition if he challenged you to
[16524.12s -> 16527.32s]  a fight? Yeah.
[16527.32s -> 16529.32s]  I would kick the shit out of myself.
[16529.32s -> 16532.52s]  Definitely.
[16532.52s -> 16534.52s]  Stopit gave $1.45
[16534.52s -> 16536.52s]  Thanks a lot, Stopit. You can tell when
[16536.52s -> 16538.52s]  it goes into sociopath mode when it becomes really quiet.
[16538.52s -> 16545.62s]  Coable, thanks
[16545.62s -> 16547.62s]  for the $5.
[16547.62s -> 16549.62s]  The smoke from the wildfire here in California
[16549.62s -> 16551.62s]  is so bad I can't leave the house.
[16551.62s -> 16553.62s]  So thank you for keeping me entertained while
[16553.62s -> 16556.63s]  I'm stuck inside.
[16556.63s -> 16558.63s]  Stay safe. Be careful.
[16558.63s -> 16562.28s]  I'm glad to be hanging out here.
[16562.28s -> 16568.04s]  Hopefully you don't see
[16568.04s -> 16570.60s]  anything too bad from that.
[16570.60s -> 16572.60s]  Take care. If you're in California, take care of yourselves,
[16572.60s -> 16576.63s]  guys. Much love to you.
[16576.63s -> 16579.70s]  It's Rusgara,
[16579.70s -> 16582.07s]  thanks for the $1.
[16582.07s -> 16584.07s]  Hey, Jerm's just dropping in and noticed that you pronounced my name.
[16584.07s -> 16586.07s]  It's Rusgara, but it's actually
[16586.07s -> 16588.07s]  Itrus...
[16588.07s -> 16590.07s]  Itrusgara.
[16590.07s -> 16592.76s]  Citrusgara.
[16592.76s -> 16594.76s]  Like citrus and gara. Anyway, I gotta go.
[16594.76s -> 16596.76s]  Oh, okay. Cool.
[16596.76s -> 16599.64s]  I get you. Thanks.
[16599.64s -> 16603.91s]  Thank you.
[16603.91s -> 16605.91s]  For the $1 and correcting my pronunciation.
[16605.91s -> 16608.34s]  Lazy Luke, thanks for the $1.
[16608.34s -> 16610.34s]  I am from the future and wanted to tell you that it was a good stream tomorrow.
[16610.34s -> 16612.34s]  Just don't eat that spider.
[16612.34s -> 16616.87s]  Gross. I gotta get out of here.
[16616.87s -> 16619.82s]  I gotta go.
[16619.82s -> 16621.82s]  E-Cookie, thanks for the $1. If you were an instrument,
[16621.82s -> 16624.25s]  what type of instrument would you be?
[16624.25s -> 16626.25s]  Probably like a cello.
[16626.25s -> 16629.26s]  Thanks, though, dude. Thank you, DivUSP for the $3.
[16629.26s -> 16632.97s]  Thanks a lot.
[16632.97s -> 16636.49s]  $3 from Div.
[16636.49s -> 16638.49s]  Talix gave $2. Thank you, Talix.
[16638.49s -> 16641.24s]  Kraiken recently started his
[16641.24s -> 16643.24s]  Ghost Commander series
[16643.24s -> 16645.24s]  where he sends four actors into a haunted house in order to
[16645.24s -> 16647.24s]  hunt a ghost.
[16647.24s -> 16649.24s]  At the same time, Chad is able to either help the actors by
[16649.24s -> 16651.42s]  voting on what they do or
[16651.42s -> 16653.42s]  help the ghost by voting on how it scares
[16653.42s -> 16655.42s]  the actors. It sounds a lot similar to the things you
[16655.42s -> 16657.42s]  wanted to do, a style
[16657.42s -> 16659.42s]  Twitch TV show with chat interaction.
[16659.42s -> 16661.42s]  Can we possibly expect a collab
[16661.42s -> 16663.85s]  in the future?
[16663.85s -> 16666.28s]  If it happens, it happens.
[16666.28s -> 16668.28s]  Yeah, there are plenty of things that I
[16668.28s -> 16670.28s]  want to do.
[16670.28s -> 16673.22s]  And if our paths cross, our paths
[16673.22s -> 16678.22s]  cross. Yeah, that's pretty
[16678.22s -> 16685.96s]  cool. We shall see.
[16685.96s -> 16688.46s]  But thanks for the $2, Talix.
[16688.46s -> 16690.46s]  That sounds really cool.
[16690.46s -> 16693.08s]  Hey, uh, Julis.
[16693.08s -> 16695.08s]  Julis. Julis.
[16695.08s -> 16697.58s]  Julis.
[16697.58s -> 16699.58s]  Thanks for the $1.
[16699.58s -> 16701.58s]  Hey, Jeremy, I've been watching you for a few months and I have to say you're one of a kind.
[16701.58s -> 16703.58s]  I usually don't subscribe to anyone but you.
[16703.58s -> 16705.58s]  Do you subscribe to anyone on Twitch? Do you have a favorite Twitch
[16705.58s -> 16707.58s]  streamer? By the way, so far you are my
[16707.58s -> 16709.58s]  favorite. Thank you for quality content. Thank you.
[16709.58s -> 16712.07s]  For the $1.
[16712.07s -> 16714.07s]  Do I have a favorite Twitch streamer?
[16714.07s -> 16718.60s]  Um...
[16718.60s -> 16723.40s]  Not necessarily.
[16723.40s -> 16728.58s]  I think that...
[16728.58s -> 16730.58s]  Talix, Vinny.
[16730.58s -> 16732.58s]  I think that the
[16732.58s -> 16734.58s]  friends and the people that I like that I know
[16734.58s -> 16736.58s]  on here, I would probably recommend their channels
[16736.58s -> 16738.58s]  because that's kind of how I found them in the
[16738.58s -> 16741.40s]  first place.
[16741.40s -> 16743.70s]  But I think I don't necessarily
[16743.70s -> 16745.70s]  have somebody that I watch
[16745.70s -> 16747.70s]  that I'm like, oh, that's my favorite streamer.
[16747.70s -> 16754.42s]  But yeah, I mean
[16754.42s -> 16756.42s]  I would say any of my friends that I know on the platform
[16756.42s -> 16758.42s]  or people that I would highly recommend.
[16758.42s -> 16763.10s]  He likes himself the most.
[16763.10s -> 16766.04s]  Oh yeah, yay.
[16766.04s -> 16768.22s]  Thank you, creepy ghost sales
[16768.22s -> 16770.22s]  for the $1. Hey, Jeremy, here's the last of my free
[16770.22s -> 16772.22s]  bits. My college campus is closed for the
[16772.22s -> 16774.22s]  rest of the week due to the horrendous air quality
[16774.22s -> 16776.22s]  in California. But hey,
[16776.22s -> 16778.22s]  that means I get some time to see the green
[16778.22s -> 16780.22s]  screen stream tomorrow. See you
[16780.22s -> 16783.93s]  then. Yeah, I mean
[16783.93s -> 16785.93s]  that's not...
[16785.93s -> 16787.93s]  I'm glad you're able to
[16787.93s -> 16789.93s]  participate and have fun on the streams
[16789.93s -> 16791.93s]  but also I'm sorry to hear
[16791.93s -> 16793.93s]  about you having to deal with that
[16793.93s -> 16795.93s]  shit. It sucks.
[16795.93s -> 16799.26s]  But just be careful.
[16799.26s -> 16801.26s]  We're all here. Glad to hang out.
[16801.26s -> 16804.20s]  Thank you for the $1, creepy ghost.
[16804.20s -> 16806.95s]  Afmeric gave
[16806.95s -> 16808.95s]  the five community subs right there right
[16808.95s -> 16812.47s]  now. Ten minutes ago, thanks a
[16812.47s -> 16817.34s]  lot. Thank you, extra cheesy for
[16817.34s -> 16819.34s]  the $1. How many vitamins does one regular assassination
[16819.34s -> 16821.34s]  give you?
[16821.34s -> 16824.79s]  Vitamins? I don't know. What does that mean?
[16824.79s -> 16828.50s]  Hey, double thanks for the $1. Hey
[16828.50s -> 16830.50s]  gamers, I fell asleep while watching the stream but don't
[16830.50s -> 16832.50s]  take it too personally. I haven't gotten
[16832.50s -> 16834.50s]  very much sleep today or the past week. Just kidding.
[16834.50s -> 16836.50s]  It's because Jerma doesn't know how to work save slots.
[16836.50s -> 16842.38s]  What?
[16842.38s -> 16844.38s]  Thank you, Dr. Clay
[16844.38s -> 16846.38s]  for the $1. I probably will not be able to watch
[16846.38s -> 16848.38s]  the green screen stream live sadly due to schedule
[16848.38s -> 16850.38s]  conflict. But I hope it goes well.
[16850.38s -> 16852.38s]  Also, the stream was a real hit, man. Take care. Thanks.
[16852.38s -> 16854.38s]  Ah, I got it. Nice.
[16857.19s -> 16859.19s]  Fudgean, awesome. Thanks for the $1. Hey
[16859.19s -> 16861.19s]  Jerma, I love the streams. I just wanted to ask you what your favorite
[16861.19s -> 16863.19s]  gorilla song is because they're my favorite band too.
[16863.19s -> 16865.19s]  Styla
[16865.19s -> 16869.48s]  That's probably my favorite song from
[16869.48s -> 16871.91s]  the band. I just like it.
[16871.91s -> 16877.48s]  There's a lot going on
[16877.48s -> 16887.91s]  in Styla. But yeah, there you go.
[16887.91s -> 16890.15s]  Thank you, Fudgean, awesome.
[16890.15s -> 16892.15s]  Thank you, Mad47 for the $1.
[16892.15s -> 16894.15s]  Nicest streamer, 2k18
[16894.15s -> 16896.97s]  Hey, is that me?
[16896.97s -> 16898.97s]  It's still surprising to have all your streams in my house
[16898.97s -> 16900.97s]  time zone. My home time zone.
[16900.97s -> 16902.97s]  Thank you for making your chat such a kind and welcome place
[16902.97s -> 16905.14s]  to everyone. Seriously.
[16905.14s -> 16907.14s]  You're a great influence. Thanks, man. Thank you.
[16907.14s -> 16909.77s]  I think this community is pretty good.
[16909.77s -> 16911.77s]  Except for when I have a meltdown
[16911.77s -> 16913.77s]  about multiplayer modes.
[16913.77s -> 16921.96s]  Fucking mode.
[16921.96s -> 16929.70s]  I just, I don't
[16929.70s -> 16931.70s]  nobody bring that up to me.
[16931.70s -> 16933.70s]  Then I command it. I demand it.
[16933.70s -> 16936.33s]  If I'm playing a game
[16936.33s -> 16938.33s]  like in a few days and all of a sudden I look over here
[16938.33s -> 16940.33s]  and it was like nice job in the Hitman multiplayer ghost
[16940.33s -> 16942.33s]  mode. I'm gonna
[16942.33s -> 16948.92s]  delete the chat. I'm just
[16948.92s -> 16951.42s]  kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
[16951.42s -> 16953.42s]  I'll put it into ghost mode.
[16953.42s -> 16956.94s]  Mario tennis all alone. No, that's not
[16956.94s -> 16958.94s]  even close to the level. Maybe it was.
[16958.94s -> 16962.46s]  How bad was Mario tennis in
[16962.46s -> 16964.46s]  regards to how mad I was at ghost mode?
[16964.46s -> 16967.14s]  Combine the two. Okay, if
[16967.14s -> 16980.07s]  Mario tennis was about
[16980.07s -> 16985.90s]  the same. Mario tennis was three
[16985.90s -> 16987.90s]  or two times as bad.
[16987.90s -> 16989.90s]  Mario tennis was way worse.
[16995.35s -> 17000.02s]  I love how that's the
[17000.02s -> 17002.02s]  that's like the barometer there.
[17002.02s -> 17004.02s]  Alright, is it
[17004.02s -> 17006.02s]  Mario tennis levels of fucking
[17006.02s -> 17008.65s]  meltdown? Mario tennis
[17008.65s -> 17010.65s]  you were upset for like two hours.
[17013.66s -> 17022.81s]  But like
[17022.81s -> 17024.81s]  let me just speak
[17024.81s -> 17027.30s]  my piece, right?
[17027.30s -> 17029.30s]  If I'm doing really bad
[17029.30s -> 17031.30s]  and I'm angry at losing
[17031.30s -> 17033.30s]  or something going wrong that I don't like
[17033.30s -> 17035.30s]  and I look over and chat and everyone's like oh my god
[17035.30s -> 17037.30s]  you're so stupid.
[17037.30s -> 17039.30s]  You're so bad. You're so dumb.
[17039.30s -> 17041.30s]  I'm just like I can't. I can't get it.
[17041.30s -> 17043.30s]  You know what I mean?
[17043.30s -> 17049.77s]  You know what I'm saying? It's like a
[17049.77s -> 17057.90s]  perfect trifecta.
[17057.90s -> 17059.90s]  It's like all three of those things
[17059.90s -> 17061.90s]  have to be happening at the same time.
[17061.90s -> 17065.29s]  Fucking Mario tennis.
[17065.29s -> 17067.29s]  The curve bullshit.
[17067.29s -> 17069.72s]  I never thought I was going to think
[17069.72s -> 17071.72s]  about it and now I'm twice as mad.
[17071.72s -> 17083.56s]  I'm going to have a nightmare tonight
[17083.56s -> 17085.56s]  that I'm playing Mario tennis
[17085.56s -> 17087.56s]  and ghost mode at the same time.
[17087.56s -> 17100.22s]  We've sent him into a
[17100.22s -> 17102.22s]  rage spiral. Call animal control.
[17102.22s -> 17104.78s]  Hey, don't ever bring it up
[17104.78s -> 17106.78s]  to me. Don't ever bring it up.
[17106.78s -> 17108.78s]  Animal control.
[17108.78s -> 17110.78s]  These are three things never to bring up
[17110.78s -> 17112.78s]  on one of these streams. Never bring up animal control.
[17112.78s -> 17114.78s]  Mario tennis or ghost mode.
[17114.78s -> 17116.78s]  Or skate 3.
[17116.78s -> 17129.26s]  Or Karazhan.
[17129.26s -> 17131.26s]  What's wrong with the first? Nothing.
[17131.26s -> 17134.46s]  Alright, that's it.
[17134.46s -> 17137.02s]  I will see you guys all tomorrow.
[17137.02s -> 17139.02s]  Devakitty gave $1 here right there right now.
[17139.02s -> 17141.02s]  German Jax, German Jax 2, German Comet, German Polito.
[17141.02s -> 17144.71s]  Thank you.
[17144.71s -> 17146.71s]  Double D with $1 right here. Anyway, what's the
[17146.71s -> 17148.71s]  update on the spider crab situation?
[17148.71s -> 17150.71s]  How many frogs have you put into each room?
[17150.71s -> 17152.71s]  There's a frog in every room.
[17152.71s -> 17155.34s]  We're good.
[17155.34s -> 17162.57s]  They have plenty of water. But
[17162.57s -> 17164.57s]  thanks everybody for watching. Here come the credits
[17164.57s -> 17167.64s]  for all the new subs. And old ones.
[17167.64s -> 17173.21s]  So I will see you all tomorrow
[17173.21s -> 17175.21s]  for the green screen stream.
[17175.21s -> 17180.71s]  It should be interesting.
[17180.71s -> 17186.28s]  I can promise you that.
[17186.28s -> 17188.28s]  Somewhere around
[17188.28s -> 17190.28s]  between 4 and 7 PM
[17190.28s -> 17192.28s]  Eastern time is when the stream will probably start.
[17192.28s -> 17195.10s]  If not, I will absolutely
[17195.10s -> 17197.85s]  let you know. It will be happening
[17197.85s -> 17199.85s]  tomorrow though, that's for sure.
[17199.85s -> 17210.46s]  Good night everybody.
[17210.46s -> 17213.27s]  Thanks again for watching. Oh, my
[17213.27s -> 17215.27s]  Hitman. Okay, so my rating
[17215.27s -> 17218.34s]  for Hitman is
[17218.34s -> 17220.34s]  all the new areas were fun.
[17220.34s -> 17222.34s]  I think the first area and the
[17222.34s -> 17224.34s]  last area were the best ones in
[17224.34s -> 17226.34s]  regards to how interesting I thought they
[17226.34s -> 17228.34s]  were for me. You can't really
[17228.34s -> 17230.34s]  racetrack like a
[17230.34s -> 17232.34s]  cult mansion.
[17232.34s -> 17234.34s]  Those are pretty amazing.
[17234.34s -> 17239.00s]  Seems like there's a lot of
[17239.00s -> 17244.25s]  content. I would say
[17244.25s -> 17246.25s]  give the multiplayer a try
[17246.25s -> 17248.25s]  if you really are into
[17248.25s -> 17251.26s]  pain
[17251.26s -> 17255.02s]  and stuff
[17255.02s -> 17261.03s]  that's not fun at all.
[17261.03s -> 17263.03s]  I brought it up again. Alright, alright.
[17265.03s -> 17267.03s]  The multiplayer mode is
[17267.03s -> 17269.53s]  good. I just didn't understand
[17269.53s -> 17271.53s]  it at first and when I finally understood it
[17271.53s -> 17273.53s]  I lost my mind because I was getting
[17273.53s -> 17275.53s]  fucking beat and then
[17275.53s -> 17277.53s]  it spiraled out of control after I shot that security
[17277.53s -> 17279.53s]  guard. Everything was just fine.
[17279.53s -> 17285.29s]  It was fun and
[17285.29s -> 17287.29s]  things were going well and then I started to
[17287.29s -> 17296.50s]  hate it. You still don't understand
[17296.50s -> 17298.87s]  it.
[17298.87s -> 17300.87s]  Am I supposed to understand how every
[17300.87s -> 17302.87s]  single thing that works in the first game
[17302.87s -> 17304.87s]  mode, first time I ever play it?
[17304.87s -> 17306.87s]  Watching a YouTube briefing
[17306.87s -> 17319.22s]  video about how to play it?
[17319.22s -> 17321.22s]  You rage quit both times.
[17321.22s -> 17324.10s]  That doesn't mean I will...
[17324.10s -> 17326.10s]  I mean I'm never going to play it again, but if I did
[17326.10s -> 17328.10s]  I would take it
[17328.10s -> 17333.03s]  slower and
[17333.03s -> 17335.59s]  hit the deck.
[17335.59s -> 17340.39s]  What is this?
[17342.39s -> 17345.46s]  Fuck you.
[17345.46s -> 17347.46s]  You guys suck.
[17349.46s -> 17351.90s]  That's for Dark Souls.
[17366.98s -> 17369.42s]  What the fuck was that?
[17369.42s -> 17372.04s]  Somebody links me that clip like every
[17372.04s -> 17374.04s]  couple of months here or every like...
[17384.65s -> 17386.65s]  Is that what I was doing during... Okay.
[17386.65s -> 17388.65s]  What was I doing?
[17388.65s -> 17390.65s]  Was I doing that during the
[17390.65s -> 17394.04s]  ghost mode? I don't remember
[17394.04s -> 17405.94s]  doing any. I just remember being angry.
[17405.94s -> 17407.94s]  Anybody have a clip during ghost mode? Was that
[17407.94s -> 17415.18s]  my worst? Because I will definitely
[17415.18s -> 17417.18s]  watch an embarrassing
[17417.18s -> 17425.88s]  meltdown right here.
[17425.88s -> 17427.88s]  You were going, oh my god.
[17427.88s -> 17433.06s]  You walk up into a food stand.
[17433.06s -> 17435.06s]  The woman running it looks at you...
[17438.71s -> 17448.57s]  I can even see the thumbnail for that one.
[17448.57s -> 17450.57s]  Like...
[17450.57s -> 17452.57s]  I don't know what that is at this point.
[17452.57s -> 17455.13s]  I can see the thumbnail.
[17468.95s -> 17472.41s]  Everything in this whole area.
[17472.41s -> 17475.22s]  Oh my god.
[17475.22s -> 17477.22s]  Oh my god. Look at how far away
[17477.22s -> 17479.22s]  I am.
[17479.22s -> 17481.78s]  Fuck this weapon.
[17481.78s -> 17484.22s]  This is Dark Souls again.
[17484.22s -> 17486.22s]  You swing over every...
[17486.22s -> 17488.22s]  Only use that weapon.
[17488.22s -> 17490.22s]  Only for a fucking boss. What a worthless fucking item.
[17490.22s -> 17492.22s]  Jesus Christ.
[17492.22s -> 17495.16s]  Oh my god.
[17495.16s -> 17497.16s]  I mean, that was probably what I did.
[17497.16s -> 17501.58s]  That's probably the same...
[17501.58s -> 17503.58s]  Is that the same clip? That could have been...
[17503.58s -> 17505.58s]  If you placed that on top of the ghost footage,
[17505.58s -> 17522.47s]  would it be the same thing?
[17522.47s -> 17524.47s]  I'm just like clicking...
[17524.47s -> 17529.90s]  Oh, this is the worst ever.
[17529.90s -> 17531.90s]  Oh my god.
[17540.58s -> 17542.58s]  Who ever said that in chat?
[17542.58s -> 17544.58s]  That started that.
[17544.58s -> 17546.82s]  You are fucking hilarious.
[17546.82s -> 17548.82s]  The Mario Tennis Link is legit.
[17548.82s -> 17550.82s]  You mean it's probably a gnome?
[17550.82s -> 17555.88s]  Let me check it.
[17557.88s -> 17564.34s]  This really is the Mario Tennis Link.
[17564.34s -> 17566.34s]  How did you get this so quickly?
[17573.48s -> 17577.13s]  Look at that shit.
[17577.13s -> 17587.82s]  What the fuck is this?
[17587.82s -> 17589.82s]  This guy's throwing a wiffle ball across the court.
[17589.82s -> 17593.08s]  Oh my lord.
[17593.08s -> 17605.10s]  That's not even the worst part.
[17605.10s -> 17610.22s]  Here it is.
[17610.22s -> 17615.46s]  I think I have to stop playing.
[17615.46s -> 17617.46s]  I have to stop playing.
[17617.46s -> 17619.46s]  Alright, I'm getting out of here.
[17619.46s -> 17621.46s]  I gotta go.
[17621.46s -> 17626.07s]  I gotta get out of here.
[17626.07s -> 17628.07s]  Anyways, thanks everybody for watching.
[17628.07s -> 17630.07s]  See you tomorrow. Have a great one.
[17630.07s -> 17632.07s]  I gotta get out of here. I'm not gonna be kidding.
[17632.07s -> 17636.68s]  Take care everybody. See you soon.
