[2.62s -> 23.53s]  Hello, how you doing? Welcome. The next big thing on Twitch. What's up everybody, how you doing?
[23.53s -> 31.11s]  Lagging? Sometimes when I, I don't know why, sometimes when I start my stream, I, it like
[31.11s -> 43.53s]  crashes. I'm gonna figure out why it's doing that. Hmm. Why did I crash? Yeah, that happened, this
[43.53s -> 53.80s]  happened last time. I'm live, right? Yeah, the stream crashes. That's really weird. I don't know
[53.80s -> 62.25s]  why that happens. Well, I think I'm back. I've got to like, reinstall something. All right. I
[62.25s -> 67.74s]  can't see the chat though. Hold on. Let me see if I can refresh it. That was a little bizarre.
[68.46s -> 78.26s]  I gotta pop out a new chat now. But anyways, hi. Welcome everybody. That's weird. Uh, gonna be
[78.26s -> 89.51s]  playing Battleship. The new Twitch meta. Lagging Larry here. That's me, Lagging Larry. We're gonna
[89.51s -> 99.85s]  play with, uh, Ludwig. I hope he doesn't even know who that is. Let me see. Huh, let me, I gotta pop
[99.85s -> 104.81s]  my chat back out. Why does my shit crash? What happened? I got a new computer. Maybe that's why.
[105.53s -> 111.35s]  I gotta pop out this chat. Hold on. Sorry. Technical difficulties already.
[113.67s -> 124.26s]  Barely are. Okay. Millionaire PC. I don't, I don't know what it is. I don't know why it keeps doing
[124.26s -> 130.09s]  it. You know, it's only for the first like five seconds that I'm like flooding my computer's DNS,
[130.09s -> 140.49s]  right? I don't even know what that means. Millionaire Barry. No, I hope you guys are doing
[140.49s -> 148.07s]  well. Uh, I'm very excited for today. I think this is going to be the best stream of the year.
[148.07s -> 150.71s]  Fuck, I shouldn't have said that. But like, you know what I mean? I'm just fucking around. But you
[150.71s -> 161.83s]  know, uh, let's go ahead. Let's see. Let's see if he's ready. Hey, hey, you there. Go ahead. My
[161.83s -> 168.57s]  stream crashed. I don't know. I don't know if you saw that. Yeah. Stream crashed, but I got it back.
[168.57s -> 171.69s]  We're back. We're good. Oh, you're back. Everyone's there. Everyone's happy.
[172.49s -> 176.81s]  Dude, my stream just crashes. I don't know why. Like I turn on OBS and my computer freezes.
[177.53s -> 184.89s]  Oh, wait. Is it, are you adjusting OBS when that happens? Um, no, I like, I'll just, I hit go live
[184.89s -> 191.62s]  and like my, I drop a ton of frames. Oh shit. Did my computer crash? I think you might have,
[192.34s -> 202.30s]  um, what is it called? Why is C cleaner running? I think of S C D bro. Why is C cleaner running?
[202.30s -> 208.30s]  You got shitty computer disorder over there. You need a better, I need to get you hooked up with
[208.30s -> 213.30s]  like a better computer. Your computer should not do that. I have a great computer though. I just
[213.30s -> 218.74s]  got like a new awesome computer with an extremely overpriced paid, like 30% premium 30 90 in it.
[219.38s -> 223.46s]  You have a 30 90? Yeah, dude. I paid like, it was, I paid for battleship.
[226.22s -> 230.70s]  Yeah. But I played other stuff besides, but you know what? This was not a fucking good
[230.70s -> 235.74s]  spending of money of me at my part. Not at all. Yeah. I played resonable eight is the only game
[235.74s -> 240.62s]  I've played that has 3d graphics. You should like be mining Bitcoin while you're live or something
[240.62s -> 246.97s]  with that card. You're wasting that. Uh, are you ready for battleship? You ready to do this?
[246.97s -> 251.69s]  I am ready for battleship. I have a bit of mutiny on my side already. Everyone's on team
[251.69s -> 256.17s]  German, my chat, which is concerning. Really? Are we in the same game? Did my internet crash?
[256.89s -> 262.41s]  No, it crashed. You're gone. Oh, okay. Yeah. I'll make a new room. That's all right though.
[263.29s -> 266.97s]  Yeah. I don't know what's going on. 30 90 for battleship. Well, it's not like you'll
[266.97s -> 273.80s]  play battleship a lot at least. I mean, you tell me this is like potentially a pretty big deal
[273.80s -> 280.30s]  from what I hear. What? What? Sorry. What? What's a big deal? The battleship is,
[280.30s -> 284.46s]  it could be really fun to play with people on stream, like with friends. Yeah. It'd be fun
[284.46s -> 288.14s]  for a bit for sure. Yeah, of course. That's what we're doing right now. That's like why we're
[288.14s -> 292.14s]  hanging out and playing it. It's yeah. Battleship is definitely fun for a little bit. Yeah. I agree
[292.14s -> 297.50s]  with you. It'd be good. It's like we'll have a good hour for it. Hour. Oh, or two. Yeah. Maybe
[297.50s -> 302.78s]  I was assuming like six. All right. I got a friend code for you, but I'm just going to say it.
[302.78s -> 306.78s]  I don't want. Should I just type it? I'll type it to you. You could say it really fast and then I
[306.78s -> 318.97s]  could try to join. No, I don't think I want to do that. I'm typing it to you in discord. Perfect.
[318.97s -> 322.33s]  There you are. All right. So does it show the room code anywhere or can I go over to the actual
[322.33s -> 328.57s]  stream? I don't see it anywhere, but I don't think there's another way for someone to join battleship.
[328.57s -> 334.14s]  I don't think so. All right. I think we're good. Just do all right. So those who don't understand
[334.14s -> 340.30s]  how battleship is played very, very complicated game you do is you get five ships. You place them
[340.30s -> 345.82s]  around and then each turn back and forth. Ludwig and I are going to try to kill each other. Sink
[345.82s -> 354.33s]  our ships. I'm sorry. Are you explaining battleship? Yeah. That makes sense. No, no bets already.
[355.29s -> 364.31s]  Oh, are you a bit of a gambling man? Let me just snap the camera on. Uh, yeah. All right. But now
[364.31s -> 367.99s]  we haven't even played one game though. You want to do this already. You want to bet all. What do
[367.99s -> 373.11s]  you want to bet? Well, we'll start. Let's just start off like casually, just like with a casual,
[373.11s -> 380.23s]  you know, let's just say five gifted, you know, just a casual breezy. I've gifted subs to the
[380.23s -> 385.18s]  other person's channel, just to the other person's channel or, or, or better yet. I thought you were
[385.18s -> 390.94s]  going to say like 500 bucks. I was like, Holy shit. We're like already going. No, we'll start.
[390.94s -> 396.71s]  I mean, it's the first match, you know, how about this? I imagine you're not tier three sub to me.
[396.71s -> 402.63s]  Is that right? That's that's incorrect. I I'm not, I'm not tier sub to tier three. Okay. I'm not
[402.63s -> 407.27s]  tier three sub to you. The loser tier three subs to the winner for just a month. All right. That
[407.27s -> 412.78s]  works. Game one. Let's go. Do you have any experience playing this? Well, let me tell you,
[412.86s -> 418.65s]  I'm using, uh, Fredrick Poitier, which try, try to click on him right now on your stream.
[418.65s -> 425.21s]  You bought this guy. Yeah. I spent money on this. Why did you buy this? It was three dollars.
[426.31s -> 429.91s]  It just changes. You're never gonna, you're never gonna open this game ever again.
[430.79s -> 436.07s]  Yeah. This is no, no, no. Yes, you are. Cause this is, yeah, this is a big deal coming on
[436.07s -> 440.70s]  Twitch soon. What, what, what? I'm sorry. What do you mean? It's a big deal coming on Twitch.
[440.70s -> 448.41s]  Like this, you're going to be playing this all the time. I think like battleship. Yeah.
[448.41s -> 452.52s]  Why are people spamming new meta in my chat? All right. You ready?
[453.08s -> 456.36s]  Here's three sub to the other person. Tier three sub to the other person.
[457.56s -> 464.42s]  Let's go. I was just press cancel. All right. So we don't tell each other where we're going,
[464.42s -> 468.18s]  right? Well, no, you're supposed to say the smallest ship where you put it.
[468.18s -> 471.70s]  You suppose you have to say the smallest ship where you put it. Yeah. You have to tell me where
[471.70s -> 477.40s]  you put your smallest ship. Okay. Small ships going bottom, right? Yeah. Mine's also going
[477.40s -> 502.54s]  the bottom, right? Okay. Can we rotate? Oh, okay. Yeah. Good luck. Oh, don't cheat. Don't look at
[502.54s -> 509.61s]  anybody's screens. No, of course not. Of course not. I'm not looking at any screens and I have my chat
[509.61s -> 516.33s]  just, just firmly out of my, out of my grip. I'm ready. You ready? I'm prepared. Yeah. Who goes
[516.33s -> 526.39s]  first? I don't even know who that is. I called heads in the air. All right, here we go. Okay.
[526.39s -> 532.25s]  You lied. You lied. Wait, did you say bottom right? I did say bottom right. Welcome to war.
[533.35s -> 541.66s]  So did I. Oh, you lied to me. It's more hurtful when you do it. Hey, here's, here's how I know
[541.66s -> 548.70s]  that this is going to be correct. He went up one square. Fuck with me. No, he didn't. Whatever.
[548.70s -> 551.50s]  Ah, maybe you're saying he went up one square because that's what you did.
[555.90s -> 563.37s]  A mirror match. He went up three squares. No, he didn't. You're, you're trying to fool me here.
[563.37s -> 570.34s]  You did not go up a square at all. You went left a square. So how do you win by sinking everything,
[570.34s -> 575.62s]  right? You got to, you got to sink my destroyer, my battleship, my star command. You got to sink
[575.62s -> 578.66s]  everything. All right. This is, this is for a tier three sub, right? I don't want to fuck around
[578.66s -> 587.00s]  anymore. This is a tier three. This is $25. Yeah. Come on. You don't do this like, you don't do this
[587.00s -> 592.38s]  like a puzzle where you do the edges first and then you go in the middle when you're like ready.
[592.38s -> 596.54s]  German, it's a, it's a children's game. You just click a random square and then occasionally you
[596.54s -> 602.38s]  hit. I mean, honestly, you'll probably do as well if you just don't even know what you're doing.
[602.38s -> 605.10s]  If you do it blind, if you get like a monkey to do it, you probably have more success.
[606.78s -> 610.46s]  I mean, you thought, you thought I was in like the edges there. You know, I thought you were
[611.10s -> 615.58s]  a corner Karen. Yeah. Oh, what do you think? I'm crazy. The way you do the thing where you
[615.58s -> 620.04s]  put all your ships in one corner. That's how you instantly lose this game. I know that at least
[620.76s -> 629.59s]  you got, well, you got one for the corner. Apparently you're a bit of a corner Karen,
[629.59s -> 633.99s]  but you get to go twice. What's this bullshit? You go until you miss. What?
[635.43s -> 639.19s]  There's no way I hated that shit. When I used to play basketball with people one on one,
[639.19s -> 642.79s]  it would be like, Oh, you go until you don't. And if whoever scored gets the ball back and I never
[642.79s -> 647.99s]  got the ball back, they just scored like 20 times in a row. Yeah. Winter winter stays is kind of
[647.99s -> 654.33s]  hard. Uh, but fortunately for you, it's not like shooting a jump shot here. I'm still shooting in
[654.33s -> 660.17s]  the dark. You're working your way up towards E 10. I'm a little nervous about my E 10 strategy.
[660.95s -> 673.22s]  E 10 eating this stick. What? It sounds like eating. Well, it's all right. You get one.
[674.90s -> 678.74s]  Oh yeah. You thought I was, you thought I was doing the thing. Yep. That's it. It was, it was
[678.74s -> 684.98s]  worth it. Yeah. I think you're in the same place. No thing about me is I'll never click where I am.
[688.28s -> 692.84s]  You're such a corner care. No, no, no, no, no, no. You just have to get the one,
[692.84s -> 706.22s]  you have to get the one that's over there. Oh God. This is your destroyer. Oh no. All right.
[707.02s -> 719.27s]  Wait, German. No, no, you didn't. It's a tier three. Oh, it's hard. You got one more. We're
[719.27s -> 725.43s]  sneaking with it. You're not going to fight. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe that last chip will save your day.
[726.30s -> 731.18s]  I have a feeling you put every ship in the bottom left except for your small one, which you put in
[731.18s -> 734.94s]  the top right. Yeah. But that would be a stupid strategy that you'd lose every time.
[739.80s -> 744.20s]  All right. I got it. It's a bit of a stupid strategy. I wouldn't recommend that.
[744.20s -> 747.88s]  Yeah. Well, it was, at least it wasn't for $2,500. It was for 25.
[748.92s -> 758.68s]  We get in there. We'll get there. Oh no. Oh, oh no. Excuse me. Somebody's right here in the middle.
[758.68s -> 765.18s]  Yeah. I went for a little, you know, a little middle play. Okay. All right. That's good for me.
[765.18s -> 774.44s]  This bottom left strategy. Would you have been so foolish? Everyone's calling you a middle Manny.
[774.44s -> 778.60s]  Yeah. Cause you got, you got stuff in the middle. I got a couple of things in the middle. I wouldn't
[778.60s -> 786.04s]  focus on it too much, which what is down here? Oh, that was your four. That was your four ship.
[786.04s -> 790.42s]  Yeah. It was my French four. I don't know what, I don't know the names of the ships. I just know
[790.42s -> 800.66s]  how many numbers there are. Okay. So I think you did. I think you, are you not as dumb as I am?
[801.38s -> 806.98s]  Did you not put anything right next to each other? No, I played this smart. I played this by the book.
[806.98s -> 813.88s]  I made a thing about me is, you know, I come up with strategies. I know you're a chess player,
[813.88s -> 822.60s]  right? Yeah. I'm a, I'm a chess player by trade. So, Oh, found you. Which way are you? I think this
[822.60s -> 832.63s]  is your little guy. Thank you. Nope. Phenomenal guess. Where did you hide this last one? This
[832.63s -> 843.05s]  is a bit devious. It's a, it's a four, right? Yeah. There's a bit of strategy involved here.
[843.05s -> 848.17s]  All I need to go is from this point diagonally upwards and then I'll eliminate every single
[848.17s -> 861.29s]  place. Oh, close. Very close. I don't trust you. I got up. It's a war of attrition right now. You
[861.29s -> 866.36s]  know what I mean? Like I just got to, you got to spend a million years finding this last one.
[866.36s -> 877.94s]  Well, I have my, my, my tugboat hidden pretty well. I only need to get one ship. Oh, all right.
[877.94s -> 886.60s]  Let's eliminate this. Everyone's screaming. Why? What do you mean? Why? They can only, there's
[886.92s -> 893.75s]  two ways it can go up or down. Oh, this is where, this is where your big guy is right here.
[893.75s -> 899.27s]  I did find my big guy. That's the easiest one to find though. Mathematically.
[899.27s -> 902.18s]  That's true. You won't find another ship for years.
[904.34s -> 907.38s]  Well, you did put them right next to you. You did the same thing I did. Didn't you?
[907.38s -> 911.38s]  Well, I had a gap. Yeah. But you saying there's a gap means that there's definitely another ship
[911.38s -> 919.16s]  right here. Yeah. You did the same thing I did. We have the same board. What?
[919.16s -> 926.76s]  What? This is really bad. This is really bad. No, it's not. This is really bad.
[927.32s -> 931.82s]  This is really bad. What do you, what do you wait? Did you do this?
[934.06s -> 937.90s]  What? How do you have two ships that are this big? You have two destroyers?
[940.06s -> 948.86s]  No. I'm so confused. I was just. You just got to keep shooting your shots captain.
[949.58s -> 958.58s]  Oh, wait a minute. Oh, they're all connected. Oh boy. You're in deep shit. Oh no.
[958.58s -> 963.38s]  Well, actually I have one last trick up my sleeve. Yeah. And I think I know where it is
[963.38s -> 971.11s]  because it's probably exactly where I put mine. You did the same thing, man. That's so funny.
[971.11s -> 978.52s]  Which way? How many are left? There's a one or two. There's only one three ship left and it's
[978.52s -> 983.72s]  either left or right here. And I don't know. Did you, did you, are you as compulsive enough?
[983.72s -> 990.84s]  Oh, that voice. I'm getting low. Were you as compulsive enough to make sure you created the
[990.84s -> 996.63s]  full Tetris line? Right? Like it has to be perfect. Or did you have? That's a good point.
[996.63s -> 1007.74s]  It is. Of course it is. That's such a good point. Where was yours? That's it. Oh, you're devious.
[1009.27s -> 1013.67s]  You won. I won the game. Yeah. The greatest comeback of all time.
[1014.63s -> 1019.11s]  But you did the same thing that I did and I just, I thought that you were so much smarter than me.
[1019.11s -> 1022.95s]  That was what I was hoping. That's what I coast off of in my life is that people think I'm smarter
[1022.95s -> 1028.31s]  than I am and then I'm not. I was hoping I would get there. All right. Well, uh, tier three, tier
[1028.31s -> 1036.79s]  three sub. It's a tier three sub. It's a tier three sub to you. I'm sending it over. There goes my
[1036.79s -> 1042.07s]  tier two. Here's where I, where, where I am kind of concerned about this. So I'm assuming we're
[1042.15s -> 1047.21s]  probably exponentially going to increase this number. Oh, did I really just blow it in the
[1047.21s -> 1054.89s]  first round? Like, Oh, I won. I won the first round. Yeah. You won the lowest stakes game.
[1054.89s -> 1059.61s]  Yeah. So when we get to like, Oh yeah, we're going to do this for $5,000, which I hope we
[1059.61s -> 1064.41s]  don't do that because I don't know if I have that, but you know, I don't win that one. I'm,
[1065.13s -> 1071.77s]  I leave the battleship casino with $4,995 in the hole, whatever it is.
[1073.46s -> 1077.78s]  That's exactly what's going to happen. Yeah. To a T. All right. You ready for the next one?
[1077.78s -> 1083.30s]  That was a good warmup. I I'm trying to subscribe. I I've found out that I can't now. I think,
[1085.98s -> 1093.98s]  I think someone gifted me a tier three, but that's been paid. I'm going to gift a tier three back
[1093.98s -> 1100.04s]  gift to tier three. Yeah. Cause I've been tier. Someone got there before I could get there.
[1100.04s -> 1106.63s]  That's so funny. All right. Let me make sure that the room codes are not here.
[1106.63s -> 1112.90s]  I imagine if we just hit rematch, it should be, okay. This was somebody, somebody just invited
[1112.90s -> 1119.05s]  me to a game. I've never heard of this name. Uh, is this a dumb question? Do you only have
[1119.05s -> 1126.41s]  one scene on your Twitch OBS? Well, I've, this is why I have multiple scenes, but what, who the,
[1126.41s -> 1132.57s]  who the fuck is Cleven? Are you, that's me. That's you. We just played a game together.
[1132.57s -> 1140.71s]  I'm Cleven. What? I thought this was like a steam user. Like, like, no, Cleven's my real name.
[1140.71s -> 1148.06s]  Wait, what? Cleven's my, it's, well, it's actually my middle name, but I went by it for a while.
[1148.06s -> 1155.21s]  I thought that was the name of your, your, your, like your guy. How did you know that?
[1155.21s -> 1159.48s]  I was hoping you wouldn't know that. Yeah. Cleven. I don't know where Cleven,
[1159.48s -> 1164.26s]  Cleven's a random name I made for a rust server eight months ago on my steam. And I've kept it
[1164.26s -> 1170.10s]  there ever since. Wait, what the fuck? I was like, who is Cleven? I'm Cleven Ballsworth.
[1170.10s -> 1176.20s]  Is that actually what you went by? Cleven Ballsworth? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I thought it
[1176.20s -> 1180.44s]  was somebody like was spammed Kevin really quickly. And they were like, I got to get in this game.
[1180.44s -> 1186.15s]  Like, Cleven. He's just trying to, they just got really like, just hastily fucked up the name
[1186.15s -> 1193.56s]  Kevin. What is, uh, hold on. I'm buying a, I'm buying a new one. You've, okay. Hold on. Wait,
[1193.56s -> 1197.24s]  wait, wait. You've spent, have you spent more money on the game than you have giving me a tier
[1197.24s -> 1203.29s]  three sub? I gifted you a tier three. Ah, you just got just buying shit. All right. I'm sticking
[1203.29s -> 1208.07s]  with, um, this guy. I don't know. Here's the thing. I was playing a Frenchman, which is just
[1208.07s -> 1217.85s]  brain dead in war. Oh, by the way, soda pop or tonic. Which one are you? Soda pop or tonic.
[1217.85s -> 1225.06s]  Soda. 100%. Okay. Yeah. Good. Good. I'd imagine where you're, so I'm from New Hampshire. Oh yeah.
[1225.06s -> 1233.66s]  All right. So I imagine we have similar. All right. Let's, let's do this. How do you say the area
[1233.66s -> 1239.90s]  where you, uh, like a, in a house, like a sectioned off area, R O O M. How do you say that?
[1239.90s -> 1247.43s]  It's a living room. And then just without the living part. Room. Me too. Yeah. I get a little
[1247.43s -> 1250.87s]  trash for that for not going room. Yeah. I don't know. But people always give me shit for saying
[1250.87s -> 1257.74s]  other stuff too. What are the, what are the other stuff? Room. Oh, okay. Wait, wait, wait. Um,
[1257.74s -> 1265.18s]  what do you put your clothes in? Dryer. Okay. You take them out of the, okay. Take them out. Okay.
[1265.18s -> 1269.42s]  You wash your clothes. You dry them. You take them out of the dryer and you put them in a.
[1271.50s -> 1276.78s]  I feel like this is a trivia test now in a, in a, are you looking for the word hamper? No, no, no.
[1276.78s -> 1279.98s]  That's what happens when your clothes are dirty. You've washed them. You've dried them. I've washed
[1279.98s -> 1285.38s]  them. I dried them. I put them away. Now you put them away in your. Well, usually in my, in my,
[1285.38s -> 1292.25s]  in my closet. Okay. But like, uh, how do I, what's the thing that you, what's the thing that you pull?
[1293.21s -> 1301.40s]  Oh, now you fucked it up. You say draw, draw, draw. It's a draw. You're not saying the full thing.
[1301.40s -> 1306.84s]  You're giving up halfway through. Oh, I gotta go to my draw. Open up, open up that draw.
[1307.80s -> 1309.88s]  But you're not, you're not, you know, you're not finishing the sentence.
[1311.59s -> 1321.77s]  Whatever. You're just saying draw. Draw. Yeah. My, my draw. How do you, do you say underwear like that?
[1321.77s -> 1327.86s]  Underwear. You don't go my drawers. Underwear. Underwear. Just underwear. Okay. Yeah. Underwear.
[1327.86s -> 1333.53s]  But it's not, but the thing though, it's not underwear. It's underwear. Right. Are we saying
[1333.53s -> 1342.15s]  it underwear? Underwear. Underwear. Am I saying it weird? Am I saying it weird too? You're making me
[1342.15s -> 1347.08s]  self-conscious about how I'm saying that now. Anyways, dude, New Hampshire, New Hampshire,
[1347.08s -> 1354.23s]  that's my fucking backyard. That's my backyard. Yeah. I, uh, I'm one of those New Hampshireites
[1354.23s -> 1358.55s]  that, you know, I'll just associate myself with Boston, even though I got no business.
[1358.55s -> 1363.14s]  Yeah. But New England, that's New England, New England, man. Red Sox nation. Yeah. That's what
[1363.14s -> 1367.30s]  I go for. I go for, I try to take all the teams, all the pride because we don't have much in New
[1367.30s -> 1371.14s]  Hampshire. So we take what we can get. I like New Hampshire. I think New Hampshire is nice.
[1371.94s -> 1376.34s]  It's good. You ever go up to pheasant lane mall and no sales tax to buy something?
[1376.34s -> 1381.96s]  I live in Vegas, man. We don't gotta worry about that here. I guess that's true. I guess that is
[1382.04s -> 1388.28s]  true. No sales tax. Yes, but the income tax. No. Yeah. I think there's no income tax in New Hampshire
[1388.28s -> 1392.49s]  as well. Oh, there's not. Yeah. Yeah. But you have to live in New Hampshire, which means you
[1392.49s -> 1400.46s]  probably develop a heroin addiction. Oh God. What's the mountains? Oh, by the way, I was just like
[1400.46s -> 1407.53s]  absentmindedly placing stuff. I think this is okay. I've placed, I feel like it's fine. All right. So
[1407.53s -> 1412.57s]  what is this for? Are we upping the stakes or are we lowering the stakes? Let's, let's do it. So
[1412.57s -> 1417.77s]  last time was a tier three. Let's, let's, let's, I feel warm right now. I'm ready for a,
[1417.77s -> 1424.41s]  you know, just like a, like a casual hundred gifted, a hundred gifted subs for this one. Oh God.
[1424.41s -> 1431.21s]  What's that? Okay. It's 500, but honestly with the, with the write-offs, you get it all back.
[1431.21s -> 1438.92s]  Vegas taxes, New Hampshire taxes. We can't go from, we can't go from $25 to 500. Okay. All right.
[1438.92s -> 1442.84s]  Well, then you give a suggestion. What's a, what's a better escalation and a better escalation would
[1442.84s -> 1449.24s]  be two X. So let's, let's do, let's do 50, 50, 50 bucks, which is what? All right. $50. What do
[1449.24s -> 1454.76s]  you mean? What is it? It's $50. How are we doing subs? Oh yeah. We can do like 10 subs. Okay. 10
[1454.76s -> 1469.53s]  subs. Wait. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. That works. I have a new strategy. You do. Oh, okay.
[1469.53s -> 1477.16s]  I, are you, okay. There's psychology here. Like, did you do the exact same layout? No. Oh, smart.
[1477.16s -> 1479.96s]  I thought you were going to do the exact same thing. That's it. There's no reason why I even
[1479.96s -> 1486.92s]  ever would aim down here. I'm going, I'm going to tell you right now from J one to a 10, just in a
[1486.92s -> 1491.18s]  diagonal line. It's going to take me too long to find that coordinate. So I'm just going to click
[1491.18s -> 1499.88s]  here. I'm, I'm marching up diagonally. All right. Like Petco stock prices in 2000. And you just have
[1499.88s -> 1503.64s]  to find me before I get to your ship. Cause I'm guaranteed to hit one on this path.
[1507.58s -> 1511.56s]  Fuck. All right. You found that quick. What do you, what is G three? What are you thinking?
[1512.36s -> 1515.90s]  I don't know. I G three was speaking to me. All right. All right. Well,
[1516.78s -> 1520.62s]  I'm sure you don't finish this off. You're going to go the wrong direction here. You think so?
[1520.62s -> 1529.27s]  Yeah. Why would you have her? I don't know. Cause I thought maybe you put them next to,
[1529.27s -> 1532.07s]  I was going to freak you out. I was going to freak out you and like you're insane.
[1532.71s -> 1540.52s]  It would have been insane, but it was just so, so bold. Oh, I found your super five, whatever
[1540.52s -> 1546.55s]  they're called. Destroyer. I think, or maybe it's, yeah, it's a destroyer. Look at that. Look at that
[1546.55s -> 1561.50s]  art. Very cool. So if, if I were you, I would be going right here. Nope. Okay. We're, we're,
[1561.50s -> 1567.05s]  you know, similar areas, but, oh, that's, but that strategy is unfair. Cause you're guaranteed
[1567.05s -> 1572.12s]  to hit something. Wait, what are you doing? I tried to be like you. I tried to be like you.
[1573.38s -> 1577.14s]  You get bold. Sometimes I thought I'd throw a little spice in it. You know, that was pretty
[1577.14s -> 1591.18s]  spicy. Oh, that was really close. That was, that means it wasn't close at all. Oh, he went the
[1591.18s -> 1601.13s]  wrong way. I hate going the wrong way. You got to wait for soda. Oh my God. That was actually
[1601.13s -> 1609.58s]  really close. Yeah, but that could all be really close. It's a 10 by 10 grid heads. I go right
[1609.58s -> 1615.00s]  tails. I go left. I'm going to get, I'm going to let you know, just fun, just for the sake of the
[1615.00s -> 1618.84s]  broadcast content quality. It didn't matter which way you went. And I literally told you,
[1618.84s -> 1624.20s]  I just actually told you, why did I do that? For some reason, I thought I got the control of the,
[1624.20s -> 1628.18s]  I thought I got control back. Why did I just tell you? I don't know. I would have kept going
[1628.74s -> 1639.11s]  left. Yeah. All right. Well, I feel good about that. I'm continuing my, my line. What are you
[1639.11s -> 1649.10s]  giggling at? I can't tell. I can't tell if you're trying to. No, dude, don't keep doing that. That's
[1649.10s -> 1653.58s]  like a dumb strategy. Don't do that. That's like stupid. Don't keep doing that. You're double
[1653.58s -> 1660.46s]  getting me. You don't like being an idiot. That's like not like, don't do it. They double get me.
[1661.37s -> 1671.66s]  All right. You'll never get the direction. Yeah. Well, obviously. Uh, here. No, I thought you were
[1671.66s -> 1678.86s]  laughing at something. You, you've really rattled me here. I think I've got you rattled. Oh, all
[1678.86s -> 1689.42s]  right. You went down with it. That's good. Yeah. I went down. I want, I want a little nuts of that.
[1689.42s -> 1695.34s]  My, if my strategy nets me one ship, this is the biggest waste of time ever. I was going to say
[1695.34s -> 1703.61s]  that's like a, that's a one for how many moves is it? Like 15. Yeah. All right. But how big is
[1703.61s -> 1711.91s]  this one? Oh, she's a big one. Keep clicking. Keep going. Oh man. Those are your two biggest ones.
[1712.55s -> 1718.39s]  Those are the easiest to find. This is good for me because where I have hid my tugboat, it will
[1718.39s -> 1725.88s]  take you years. Damn it. I thought it was that one. That would have been hard. All right. Last one.
[1725.88s -> 1732.20s]  And then I've done my line. Okay. Yeah. Well, you know what? Just go the other way. Do the other
[1732.20s -> 1739.91s]  diagonal. You'll probably get something. I'm sure. I feel like you've word played me a bit here.
[1739.91s -> 1746.52s]  Maybe you told me right. Cause there's something to the left. No, I think your strategy would work
[1746.52s -> 1756.14s]  if you did it the other way. Wait, like a one to J 10. You'd probably hit like five. Oh,
[1758.57s -> 1769.99s]  see too. Shit. Okay. Okay. You'll, you're going to fuck up the direction a couple of times here.
[1769.99s -> 1778.23s]  Ooh. Ooh. This is the lying better. I mean, yeah, kind of. I'll tell you right now. It's B2.
[1778.23s -> 1782.84s]  I'll tell you right now. It's B2. I don't think it is. You gotta go up. You gotta go up. Trust me.
[1783.42s -> 1789.03s]  I'm going to, I'm going to do it. I'm going to trust him. Oh, you got it down left, right.
[1789.03s -> 1797.72s]  Never eat soggy waffles. It wasn't even go B2. Trust me there. B2. All right. If it's not B2,
[1797.72s -> 1806.87s]  then I'm going to be. Oh my God. What the hell? Why did it work? It worked. Honesty. All right.
[1806.87s -> 1818.04s]  We'll go B seven. All right. Fuck you. All these information I've given for what feel like a bot
[1818.04s -> 1827.53s]  and spy lie lying warfare. All right. So where are your little, where's your little one? My little
[1827.53s -> 1830.57s]  one. I will. Do you want me to tell it to you? Cause I can't tell it to you. I can tell you the
[1830.57s -> 1838.82s]  row. I will not tell you the exact number. All right. Give me the, give me the row. It's G.
[1838.82s -> 1848.63s]  It's G. It has to be with this one. Wait, wait. But if it was two, it would have to be in the middle.
[1848.63s -> 1857.48s]  I played pick girls. I could go up down. It could go up down. They span because they got it. You
[1857.48s -> 1865.48s]  gotta have up down, you know, cause it could be G and F or G and H, you know, or I think you're
[1865.48s -> 1874.65s]  right here. You like, you like pairing things. I do. I like having things together. I like having
[1874.65s -> 1881.03s]  things paired up. I just realized I didn't shoot this ship last turn. No, you didn't. I feel like
[1881.03s -> 1897.72s]  you would do something like this. Oh, good call. But nope. So it looks like you, okay. You, you
[1897.72s -> 1903.61s]  actually made a pretty significant map here. You moved around, you have them all scattered out,
[1903.61s -> 1911.86s]  like, like, like an actual strategy. I did that too. And it is, it is not be fruited me much.
[1911.86s -> 1918.90s]  Well, I mean, we're still, I'm one ship ahead of you. That's, this can change in a second.
[1918.90s -> 1924.09s]  That is true. That is true. And I did get one of your threes. I feel good about that. It's
[1924.09s -> 1929.10s]  whoever's tugboat lasts the longest. This is going to keep escalate. It's going to keep,
[1929.10s -> 1932.54s]  doesn't dude, it doesn't matter who wins any of these right now, because whoever wins like the
[1932.54s -> 1937.50s]  $500 one, like just wins everything. Anyways, like that. Oh yeah. No, you're a hundred percent
[1937.50s -> 1942.26s]  right. I just went to Vegas. We were, I was doing like craps, you know, it's the game I like to play
[1942.26s -> 1948.02s]  with like a big group of people. And I was betting modestly the entire weekend. And then Sunday
[1948.02s -> 1952.02s]  rolled around and I was like, fuck it. I'm, I'm up a couple thousand. So I started betting just
[1952.10s -> 1956.74s]  nonsensically. I just started betting like 500. I lost everything. Nothing I did mattered because
[1956.74s -> 1960.98s]  I knew I was just going to escalate to a point where it was make or break and I broke everything.
[1960.98s -> 1967.26s]  It was gone. So, so wait, hold on. You were up with thousands of dollars. I was up $4,000.
[1968.54s -> 1973.35s]  Come on that you got to do. Come on. And then Sunday rolled around and I wanted to be up more
[1973.35s -> 1978.87s]  money. So I just put it, you know, the you play craps ever I've dabbled a few times. I just put
[1978.87s -> 1989.10s]  everything on the field, just $4,000, you know, just trying to run it up to a 25 grand. What are
[1989.10s -> 1992.94s]  you trying to do? Well, no, I have a, I have a goal because I think if you don't have a goal,
[1992.94s -> 1997.66s]  it's not stupid. Wait, you go, wait, hold on. You're going into Vegas gambling with a goal
[1997.66s -> 2003.80s]  of how much money you want of how much money, of what I want to win. Oh my God. That's, that's not,
[2003.80s -> 2009.08s]  that's, that's don't do that. I go in with a thousand and I want to leave with a really
[2009.08s -> 2018.28s]  nice watch. Oh my God. No, that's good. That's a good thing to do. I mean, if you, if you, if
[2018.28s -> 2022.60s]  you're going to give it to you for free because you like hit a jackpot and they go, how about this
[2022.60s -> 2028.04s]  watch instead of the 40 grand? I would be like, sign me up. Can I get two? Wait, you would take
[2028.04s -> 2034.28s]  the watch over 40 grand? Well, I, well, I get like a really nice roll. I'd get a $40,000 watch.
[2034.28s -> 2038.87s]  I don't know. Expensive watches always didn't do it for me. It was always just like somebody come
[2038.87s -> 2044.81s]  take this from me. I'm not a watch guy by any means. I just think that getting it for this
[2044.81s -> 2049.45s]  occasion would be, would be cool. Cause it'd be like my Vegas watch. And then people would be
[2049.45s -> 2054.14s]  like, where'd you get that watch? And I'll be like, do I got a story for you? I'd walk them
[2054.14s -> 2058.94s]  through every blackjack and craps table hand. The expensive watch on your wrist is like,
[2058.94s -> 2062.54s]  you remember in GTA online when somebody became like the bounty and they just showed up on the
[2062.54s -> 2067.08s]  mini map. Yeah. It's just like, you're just like showing up on everybody's mini map with this
[2067.16s -> 2072.76s]  gigantic, expensive, like $500,000 thing on your hand. Yeah. If I were to leave my house, sure. But
[2072.76s -> 2078.18s]  you know, it's probably not found. Look at all these empty spaces, these gaps. How have I not
[2078.18s -> 2084.65s]  found you? Oh, I miss clicked that. I don't understand where you could even be right here.
[2085.45s -> 2091.83s]  I'm eliminating all these one spaces. Yeah. I'm actually wasting my time up here because he's so
[2091.83s -> 2097.35s]  many places where you kind of hit your tugboat. It's almost frustrating. Yeah. You, you focus so
[2097.35s -> 2103.27s]  much on the top here. I'm clearing out the top completely because you could have hit it there.
[2103.27s -> 2109.69s]  And I'm going to be so sad. Like, look at this. Do you see a five and six? Yeah. If your tugboat
[2109.69s -> 2116.95s]  was there, I would lose my life going for the bottom. So I have to guess there. Is it possible
[2116.95s -> 2121.82s]  to fill the whole board and not, what happened? Okay. What happens if you miss everything and
[2121.82s -> 2128.33s]  like this still boats on like spaces? Does every bolt just lose? Wait, there's no way to, it's not
[2128.33s -> 2131.37s]  like you run out of bullets. Do you run out of bullets actually? I don't know. Do you run out
[2131.37s -> 2139.34s]  of the bullets? No, I, I imagine not. That would be shocking. All right. Now I'm going for the five
[2139.34s -> 2144.90s]  strap. Cause I know you're destroyers out there. I'm just, I'm just looking for a place where there
[2144.90s -> 2162.02s]  are two and I got it. Oh, no, no. Okay. Now I'm in trouble. I mean, do you mean I'm in trouble now?
[2162.02s -> 2166.66s]  That's, that's my battle. Look how nicely it was tucked in. You painted around it. Yeah. That it
[2166.66s -> 2170.98s]  was an actual, uh, like in a Looney Tunes cartoon where they fire the machine out of the person and
[2170.98s -> 2174.66s]  it just does like the lines around them. And then like the wall breaks behind them and they'd run
[2174.66s -> 2179.86s]  away. Yeah. Yeah. It just falls behind them and there's just that, that faint outline,
[2179.86s -> 2184.26s]  but then you still shot Bugs Bunny at the end, which was fucked up for a children's cartoon.
[2184.26s -> 2188.71s]  Yeah. You somebody say I'm used to like shoot at people to like dance. Like then that's kind
[2188.71s -> 2199.11s]  of fucked up, isn't it? It is fucked up, but also in a way art. Yeah. What did he'd be like,
[2199.59s -> 2205.80s]  well, wait, was it just an awful shot? No, I think it was like abusive. There was,
[2205.80s -> 2209.80s]  he was firing at them to like at their left, but why wouldn't he just shoot Bugs Bunny in the,
[2209.80s -> 2216.10s]  in the stomach? I don't understand. Why not simply murder Bugs Bunny? Because he was always like,
[2216.10s -> 2219.38s]  like, all right, you're right. You're right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right.
[2219.38s -> 2224.02s]  Right. He would do that. And then he would fire like 400 rounds at him. Yeah. I don't know. Like
[2224.02s -> 2233.66s]  missing almost all of them. I think he just fits the stereotype. Like the, like I get off my lawn.
[2233.66s -> 2240.12s]  I'm down. I'm never going to find this. That was a family guy joke. Whatever. You get that
[2240.12s -> 2244.14s]  problem. Family guy had good jokes. Oh, there it is. That's your destroyer. No, it's not.
[2245.02s -> 2248.54s]  That's your destroyer. No, it's not. It's not even a destroyer. You're going too,
[2248.54s -> 2259.22s]  it's too much. You're going to miss this last one. Heads I go right, tails I go left.
[2265.26s -> 2272.25s]  God damn it. The coin. God in his head. That was me. That was all me. Don't think
[2272.25s -> 2283.69s]  German is even good. You're just really bad. Okay. Look, can you be bad at like throwing a
[2283.69s -> 2288.17s]  handful of popcorn in the air and just like looking at the ground and picking up one or two
[2288.17s -> 2294.55s]  random pieces? Can you be bad at that? Not really. I mean, let's be real. I did stack all of my ship
[2294.55s -> 2299.13s]  into the bottom left last round. I think that's a bad strat. Oh, I did the same thing though.
[2299.13s -> 2303.77s]  Yeah. But even you had the, the, you know, the redundancies of throwing a tugboat in the top
[2303.77s -> 2307.69s]  right as a security measure. All right. All right. All right. Well, this is fine though,
[2307.69s -> 2314.84s]  because what I'm doing is hustling you. Cause if I lose a couple, you start to get a little confident.
[2314.84s -> 2318.76s]  That's true. You could be just pulling the hustle on me and then I strike.
[2321.32s -> 2325.88s]  So where, where, what? That was one tier one sub and then one 10 subs,
[2325.88s -> 2333.43s]  one tier three sub 10 subs. You won $75. All right. How much did you go into the casino with?
[2334.07s -> 2339.18s]  What do you mean? Walked like last and Vegas. How much did you, how much did you go in with?
[2339.18s -> 2342.94s]  I went in with $900. Okay. I'm going to try to get $900 from you.
[2344.92s -> 2351.91s]  Well, you're trying to fuck me like the casino did. Yeah. I'll give some back sometimes.
[2351.91s -> 2355.51s]  You should think about me. We'll do another game where it's like, oh, this one's for $200.
[2356.39s -> 2360.87s]  And you'll, I'll just lose on purpose and I'll just give you $200. And then you'll keep playing
[2360.87s -> 2367.16s]  and I'll make it way harder. I have a really good strategy where if I lose like, let's say
[2367.16s -> 2373.16s]  $500, I'll chase my losses and bet another 500 to win it back. And then if I lose that,
[2373.16s -> 2381.30s]  I'll bet like a thousand to chase those losses and win that back. Um, wait, what is this? Hold on.
[2381.30s -> 2387.74s]  Alone in the dark. Is this like a, is this an alone in the dark game? What, what are you looking
[2387.74s -> 2394.71s]  at? Is this named dev? Why don't I'm confused? Like in the, in the, is that, no, that's my way.
[2394.71s -> 2398.76s]  Is that, it's my profile picture. I think. Are you looking at your own profile picture getting
[2398.76s -> 2402.76s]  confused? Yeah. I thought, I thought this was like an alone in the dark dev made this or something.
[2402.76s -> 2407.62s]  It was like an ad for alone in the dark. Now I understand that. I remember I made it alone
[2407.62s -> 2411.14s]  in the dark because it's such like an unassuming profile picture. I used to hide when I played TF
[2411.14s -> 2415.06s]  two. So people wouldn't know it was me. So I could just play a game and like hide and like make my
[2415.06s -> 2418.74s]  name like fucking like vacuum cleaner and like make my profile picture, something just completely
[2418.74s -> 2422.42s]  unassuming. So that's what that is. It's been that long since you've changed your profile picture?
[2422.42s -> 2426.54s]  Probably. Yeah. It's probably been like two or three years. That's insane. It's like, when you
[2426.54s -> 2432.14s]  hold tab, it's like, I didn't have, oh, German, like German, NA five, the germ, the logo. Like
[2432.22s -> 2436.14s]  I didn't do that. Like if you saw alone in the dark, you'd be like, oh, I don't fucking know
[2436.14s -> 2439.90s]  anything about that guy. I don't care. Right. Cause then if someone saw a German, they might,
[2439.90s -> 2444.71s]  they might just chase you the whole time. Yeah. Cause I wouldn't, I wanted to like be able to play
[2444.71s -> 2449.83s]  without having like any like, oh, there's like the guy, let's go get him or like, let's help him. I
[2449.83s -> 2459.86s]  wanted to be like completely a natural environment. All right. That commander was not working out for
[2459.86s -> 2472.41s]  me. It's time to buy a new one. I'm going complete free to play. I'm purchasing Sir Philip Wade. Look
[2472.41s -> 2477.30s]  at my ships. They're beautiful. Yeah. They actually, the art does change. That's true.
[2477.30s -> 2482.66s]  That's the only thing I'm paying. It's $3 every time I've spent $9 on changing the art of my
[2482.66s -> 2486.90s]  ships. I think you just woke up like one of the devs of this game from like Hasbro because they
[2486.90s -> 2490.98s]  just got like a text on their phone because that probably happens so infrequently that they have a
[2490.98s -> 2495.13s]  tied to notifications on their, on their cell phone. They have, it's like a wolf blast. They
[2495.13s -> 2499.77s]  get a text, an email, a Twitter notification. All right. So what do we, what do we got going
[2499.77s -> 2504.17s]  here for this one? What's going on here? So look, we've, we've, we've escalated. You've,
[2504.17s -> 2509.86s]  you've won, uh, two of the money ones. How about we, how about we remove the money for this one?
[2509.86s -> 2517.40s]  I have, I have a bit of a fun idea. Okay. The loser gets to buy a shirt for the winner that
[2517.40s -> 2525.02s]  they have to wear on stream camera on, of course. Okay. So wait, but I buy a t-shirt that you have
[2525.02s -> 2532.62s]  to wear on stream. You buy a t-shirt and I'll wear it on stream. Yeah, exactly. Okay. All right.
[2533.10s -> 2542.81s]  T-shirt the loser wants. Now I will say it must follow TOS. No, but yeah, it's, it's any t-shirt
[2542.81s -> 2550.04s]  the loser wants. Oh, this is way more. This is way more than like $20. This is worth a lot more to
[2550.04s -> 2555.24s]  me. This actually is more about, we could go back to money and save this one because we can do this
[2555.24s -> 2569.45s]  at any point. No, I, I, I, I'm into it. Someone said to look at the battleship category.
[2571.10s -> 2578.87s]  No, come on. What is this? What, what, what, what is it? Look at the battleship category.
[2578.87s -> 2584.66s]  Look at the battleship category. Yeah. On Twitch. Look at the fucking battleship category on Twitch.
[2584.66s -> 2590.22s]  All right. Hold on. I'm like a joke. I'm a slow boomer. It takes me a while.
[2590.22s -> 2595.38s]  No, take your time. Take your time. I'm sure it'll stay there for a while. Okay. Back to Twitch.
[2596.82s -> 2605.26s]  Battleship category. I'm so slow. You did this in two seconds. I'm like category dashboard.
[2605.98s -> 2614.34s]  Okay. Battleship. Where is it? Fuck. I'm too old for this. I didn't need help.
[2615.38s -> 2619.83s]  I'm going to link it to you. You just click open my link. They changed it. Did you? Oh, there we go.
[2619.83s -> 2630.41s]  Browse. Okay. And then you just got to show it to your chat. Okay. Battleship. What the fuck is it?
[2632.36s -> 2637.72s]  I linked it to you on discord. You can click it. Oh, thank you, son. Appreciate it. No, no problem.
[2638.76s -> 2645.32s]  Respect. Oh, it's the directory. Right. Oh, thank you, son. Person losing. German one, Ludwig zero.
[2645.32s -> 2652.38s]  Person watching who's losing. Person who's watching. I want to screenshot this. Oh, it's
[2652.38s -> 2659.58s]  unnecessary to screenshot. This is amazing. This is terrible. No, this is incredible. It's slightly
[2659.58s -> 2667.21s]  defamatory. I took a screenshot. I need that later. It's just my stupid face. And then someone who's
[2667.21s -> 2672.54s]  pointing to me losing and then someone watching me losing. Oh, we do. Should we encourage this or not?
[2672.54s -> 2677.82s]  I feel like we shouldn't because now someone said refresh. Oh, okay. Yeah. All right. Did it get
[2677.82s -> 2682.46s]  worse? Yeah, it did get worse. It's person who's watching the person who's watching who's losing.
[2682.46s -> 2690.12s]  Oh, my God. You guys, you are blowing up the Hasbro guy's phone. Another person went live
[2690.12s -> 2694.20s]  playing Hasbro's battleship. Oh, my goodness. I can't wait to see what they're doing. We need to
[2694.20s -> 2701.48s]  make a sequel to Battleship. All right. We'll let that be for a little while. Yeah, let that
[2701.48s -> 2708.18s]  fester and we'll come back to 18 people watching me lose. I need to win is what I'm noticing. I need
[2708.18s -> 2713.77s]  to make a little bit of a comeback story. I can't look. I can't go on forever. I don't think I can
[2713.77s -> 2726.62s]  win free in a row. You saying that is so stressful for me. Okay, I've gone one less ship. There's too
[2726.62s -> 2739.02s]  many. I've gone for a stratagem. This might be stupid. This is so stupid. What a stupid thing
[2739.02s -> 2747.37s]  I'm doing. Hold on. Let me see if this works. There we go. For people watching my chat like,
[2748.01s -> 2760.30s]  I mean, all right. All right. I've I've developed the stratagem tails. Come on. First and get it
[2760.30s -> 2767.70s]  goes first has a huge advantage. Just inherently as if you land, then you want you pretty much can get
[2767.70s -> 2782.46s]  one. You don't know what direction is though. You're from East Coast. Why did you do that?
[2782.46s -> 2786.94s]  Why did you do that? I clicked wrong. I just actually misclicked. What the fuck?
[2788.86s -> 2797.02s]  Wait, what did I just stumble upon? Jerma? What have you? The game is bugging for me.
[2797.02s -> 2802.30s]  The game is the game bugging for you. Oh, yeah. Is it bugging? I specifically remember a phrase
[2802.30s -> 2808.84s]  that would watch what I'm doing here. Come on, give me that might have been the greatest
[2808.84s -> 2811.64s]  misclick of all time. All right. You went northbound on both of these then.
[2813.99s -> 2823.46s]  Oh, that's huge. You went northbound. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Parallel. Look at this.
[2825.21s -> 2834.89s]  That was a misclick of this entry. No, this is bad. This is bad. I don't know. I don't finish.
[2834.89s -> 2838.81s]  Oh, you forgot about the ship. I think I see what you're doing. You're trying to see if I went that
[2838.81s -> 2854.68s]  way. They did the same thing. I'm not that much of an idiot. I just don't buy the mega milk shirt.
[2854.68s -> 2859.72s]  That just that's my one request. Don't say that one more time. Don't buy the mega milk shirt.
[2859.72s -> 2864.20s]  That's like my one request. Just don't do that for you. When I win this,
[2864.20s -> 2869.37s]  don't buy you the mega milk shirt. Yes. So please don't do that. Could you tell me why
[2869.37s -> 2873.05s]  I should show you mercy here? Well, first of all, you got to win. Oh my what?
[2873.05s -> 2881.05s]  You're looking at my screen. You're cheating. I want to win this one. Everyone gets one cheat.
[2881.05s -> 2885.29s]  Come on. It's Twitch. You know, you're allowed to cheat on one game show on one on one battleship
[2885.29s -> 2892.02s]  game. Oh, no. But the thing is, though, I have something very hidden. He's not going to understand
[2892.02s -> 2900.49s]  where it is. Okay. You know, be wicked funny if you got me in the t shirt for the band that I
[2900.49s -> 2905.11s]  fucking hate more than anything. What is that? I don't know. I don't think I want to tell you
[2905.11s -> 2910.07s]  because if you buy it, then it's really embarrassing. I have a like it almost feels
[2910.07s -> 2914.23s]  the way you're posturing. This is that you like you love this band. No, I have a thing with my
[2914.23s -> 2918.15s]  chat where we talk a ton of shit about the gorillas. Like I just hate them. They're like the worst
[2918.15s -> 2922.39s]  really in the history. Yeah. It's just like me going. I would hate if you got me a signed Tom
[2922.39s -> 2928.63s]  Brady jersey like that would suck so much. Please don't do that. Where are your ships? They don't
[2928.63s -> 2936.06s]  exist. You're doing the the old the old rabbit you're shooting around. Yeah, I really am. I
[2936.06s -> 2950.82s]  have no rhyme or reason to this. Oh, I think you put a ship in G3. You don't think about the
[2950.82s -> 2958.62s]  letters of the numbers, do you? No, I just my brain just goes fired there. There's no point.
[2958.62s -> 2962.81s]  I don't think the numbers mean much. No, you're probably right. I think I'm putting too much
[2962.81s -> 2970.73s]  weight into them. So what is this mega milk shirt? I'm going to look this up right now.
[2970.73s -> 2974.81s]  Don't don't don't look it up. No, I'm serious. I'm actually serious. Like you probably shouldn't
[2974.81s -> 2980.01s]  look it up on stream. That's I would look it up off stream. Well, no, don't. No, no, no, no, no.
[2980.01s -> 2983.85s]  Don't look it up off stream either. Don't even look. There's no reason to look it. What the
[2983.85s -> 2988.73s]  hell is this? It's not like, oh, hey, off stream. Go look at this. No, people are freaking out.
[2988.73s -> 2992.01s]  It's it's just it's like I don't know. I don't know. I can't even explain it. Just
[2992.01s -> 2996.65s]  don't look it up ever. OK, I looked it up on Amazon and what I saw was this shirt that said
[2996.65s -> 3003.05s]  mega milk. They're very tame. But then one of the shirts has an anime character. Yeah, don't look
[3003.05s -> 3008.01s]  it up. Really? OK, yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry. Be careful. You're not talking about that, right?
[3008.01s -> 3012.28s]  Like, obviously, that's not related. It's just a separate. No, somebody like that. Yeah,
[3012.28s -> 3016.52s]  that's unrelated. And it's not. Yeah, that's a bet. It's not even worth looking at. OK,
[3016.52s -> 3023.16s]  yeah, it's not even worth looking up. That makes sense. I wore that shirt, by the way.
[3024.12s -> 3036.23s]  The on stream. No, no, I have this shirt that's like a blue, like a Toronto Blue Jays
[3036.23s -> 3041.99s]  S baseball tee. It's the blue sleeves and the white on the front. And every time I wear it,
[3041.99s -> 3046.07s]  people say I'm wearing the mega milk shirt. And I'm just like, leave me alone. I like this shirt.
[3046.07s -> 3052.79s]  I like the colors. Who is Blue Jays S like the same color? Yeah, it's like it's like that blue
[3052.79s -> 3058.15s]  and white baseball. It's just a color. OK, all right. Yeah, I see that. So like the sleeves
[3058.15s -> 3064.23s]  are different color from the body and it looks like the mega milk shirt just without the text
[3064.23s -> 3068.07s]  on it. The more you talk about this, I have to tell you, the funnier it is, the more I want to
[3068.07s -> 3079.38s]  do this. Would I get suspended if I wore the mega milk shirt? Oh, I mean, look, Twitch is I am I
[3079.38s -> 3083.06s]  don't know which one you're talking about. You'd have to link it to me for me to know because I've
[3083.06s -> 3092.10s]  worn a slew of bad things slew. It's it's numerous because I do an Amazon stream. I let chat buy
[3092.10s -> 3097.42s]  anything and I'll wear it. So, you know, I've worn shirts that say like come in me. I'm here for the
[3097.42s -> 3108.18s]  bukkake. I have a set of keycaps that are just gatchy keycaps, just abhorrent things. I have a
[3108.18s -> 3118.12s]  six hundred dollar statue of Nami from one piece. OK, the first one has got you got you got me a
[3118.12s -> 3125.35s]  little twisted on that one that you wore that on stream. The come in me shirt. Yeah. Oh, yeah. I
[3125.35s -> 3133.19s]  wore that. I wore that out. I were away. We wear this frequently. I wore it like because I don't
[3133.19s -> 3139.66s]  leave my house often. So I wore it like, you know, a pretty good amount in my home because I thought
[3139.66s -> 3145.82s]  it was funny. But unlike, you know, without thinking much, I went to Vegas one time and I was
[3145.82s -> 3152.34s]  wearing that and I and I didn't realize until someone pointed at my shirt and went that that's
[3152.34s -> 3157.70s]  insane. It's just like, oh, shit. And I was like, oh, shit. And I put it inside out. I was embarrassed.
[3157.70s -> 3163.88s]  And so it said Mucknee M for the rest of the day. That's the kind of shirt you have to make sure
[3163.88s -> 3168.60s]  is not available if you have to do laundry or something like it's the only shirt left. Yeah.
[3168.68s -> 3177.56s]  Yeah. Finally, I fucking land on you. I do feel in a in a great spot right now because I only have
[3177.56s -> 3184.09s]  your destroyer, which is a five X ship. Yeah. It can only be in so many locations. I'm in trouble.
[3184.09s -> 3209.48s]  Let's see. This should be it. Oh, I get to live another day. What? Oh, you're up. Once you see my
[3209.48s -> 3214.62s]  strategy, it's going to change the battleship meta. You think so? I genuinely think so. I went
[3214.62s -> 3219.86s]  for a Jack and the Beanstalk method. Wait, does that mean that you went just in a straight line
[3219.86s -> 3232.17s]  the whole way? No, no, no, no. Although that's a great strategy, I'm sure. And I almost get the
[3232.17s -> 3236.02s]  feeling that you're throwing on purpose because you want to wear this mega milk shirt. I want to.
[3236.02s -> 3239.88s]  I don't even know why you would have bought something like I have no idea why I said that.
[3239.88s -> 3243.48s]  Yeah, I would have never. There's no universe where I would have gotten. You know what? I'm
[3243.48s -> 3249.82s]  going to get you a mega milk shirt. It's a you brought it up like, oh, please don't do this to
[3249.82s -> 3256.87s]  me. I don't know why I get the feeling you know, maybe party wants to try it. Oh, no,
[3256.87s -> 3262.34s]  I might not get the opportunity. But I don't know what kind of shirt would I get you if I absolutely
[3262.34s -> 3268.38s]  probably know I'm not going to win. Let's let's not worry about that. I still I only need one.
[3268.38s -> 3276.41s]  You only need one. But if you happen to get it, OK, you're covering my Jack and the Beanstalk.
[3276.97s -> 3291.24s]  I am whiffing a lot, though. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. On a five ship. Oh, come on. Painting around it.
[3292.36s -> 3307.99s]  OK, it's a five X. It can be here. It can be up here. All right. There's a two,
[3308.63s -> 3316.14s]  a two and a four and a three and three. I'll give you a hint. I'll make it spicy.
[3316.14s -> 3319.88s]  What? It's not. You said Jack and the Beanstalk. That would be straight up.
[3319.88s -> 3327.27s]  I'll give you a hint right now. You might need to refresh your browser on Twitter,
[3327.27s -> 3330.07s]  like the channel. I'm watching your channel right now that you refresh your channel.
[3331.30s -> 3340.18s]  It's F5. It's a it's like a technical joke. You're right here. No, you're not.
[3341.62s -> 3346.76s]  Joe, I told you were. Oh, you were telling me where you were.
[3347.80s -> 3352.28s]  I was telling you. Oh, it's F5. I thought you were doing like a hit F5.
[3352.28s -> 3354.44s]  You're watching my stream. I know you're cheating. Ha ha.
[3356.46s -> 3361.58s]  No, I was trying to give you information. Oh, but I think that was the only place
[3361.58s -> 3367.94s]  it could have been there. Well, congratulations. I feel good. I don't know if you threw that on
[3367.94s -> 3375.64s]  purpose, but my strategy was pretty impeccable. No, I thought you were going up up. Well,
[3375.64s -> 3379.24s]  we don't know if he's going to buy the Mega Milk shirt or not. You know what I mean? Nobody knows
[3379.24s -> 3385.32s]  that he could find a favor might have something really funnier to do. If you could just link me
[3385.32s -> 3393.34s]  the Mega Milk shirt you're referencing, what happens if I look up Mega Milk Jerma? Oh,
[3393.34s -> 3397.18s]  I do not think you should do that. And I'm serious about that one. I'm dead serious.
[3397.18s -> 3401.67s]  I don't know if you should write that. This is fine. It's just that the text can't be there's
[3401.67s -> 3405.91s]  nothing wrong with the text, right? Does Mega Milk mean something I'm unaware of? I don't know. I
[3405.91s -> 3411.61s]  don't know what it means. I just know it's something that's like TOS. Look up Mega Milk on a wiki.
[3411.61s -> 3416.73s]  That's a website I can't pull up. I don't know. I just know that it's like a thing. It's like a,
[3417.29s -> 3422.25s]  I got some kind of potentially sexual thing. I don't know. Okay. I'm looking this up. You
[3422.25s -> 3428.47s]  said the shirt you like it, but you're you're just wearing it here. I mean, in broad daylight,
[3428.47s -> 3431.83s]  you are wearing. No, that's somebody photoshopped that. That's not real. No,
[3432.82s -> 3439.38s]  how would they Photoshop with the lanyard? No, I know that image. Yeah. No, that's a Photoshop
[3439.38s -> 3443.06s]  shirt that they like. You're telling me that's not real. It's not real. No, I didn't wear it in
[3443.06s -> 3449.72s]  public. I don't know if I buy that. It seems like an innocent enough shirt. It's just look,
[3449.72s -> 3455.72s]  how about this? You'll just you'll think of something really funny to make me wear. And it's
[3455.72s -> 3460.49s]  definitely not going to be that one. All right. All right. I'm going to just link you an option
[3461.13s -> 3467.02s]  and you just look at it. And then I want you to react to it and tell me what you think. Okay. So
[3467.02s -> 3475.00s]  I did you give it to me as an image, by the way, because I'm so stupid. I don't, I don't,
[3475.00s -> 3481.00s]  I don't want to wear that. You're not a fan of this one. Okay. This is like, I don't, I,
[3481.00s -> 3484.36s]  can I even wear this? How did you, how did you not get in trouble for this?
[3484.36s -> 3494.71s]  Wearing your shirt that says, come in me. Hold on. I have to show it.
[3494.71s -> 3511.82s]  JPG. What is this? Why is this saved? Can I show this? I don't want to show this. I have to wear
[3511.82s -> 3517.91s]  this. This is what you're deciding on. Okay. We saw it. I don't want that on this camera.
[3517.91s -> 3530.90s]  Oh, I just muted and deafened at the same time. Sorry. You've been deafened for like probably
[3530.90s -> 3535.34s]  two minutes. I'm sorry. I hit the wrong button. That's all right. Are we going to have more of
[3535.34s -> 3551.80s]  these? Okay. I'm just sending you a few shirts that I think this one's pretty good too. You look
[3551.80s -> 3559.05s]  soft. Are you showing your chat yet? Yeah. Each one that comes in, they're getting, they're getting
[3559.05s -> 3566.34s]  a view of it. All right. All right. This is one I wore, uh, quite a lot actually. My, my girlfriend
[3566.34s -> 3573.66s]  took it. She, she likes wearing it now because it's a pretty comfy shirt, but, but affirmed,
[3573.66s -> 3580.82s]  they have been worn on stream. Oh my God. You said your girlfriend, you said your girlfriend,
[3580.82s -> 3590.82s]  where's this now? Regularly. I mean, all right. People are going to screen cap this. I have to
[3590.82s -> 3605.38s]  go like, no, no, no, I am. That's not me. No. Yeah. You have to have your, uh, uh, what about
[3605.38s -> 3610.57s]  this one? I do not look forward to wearing these. Okay. What do you got? What do you got for me?
[3619.02s -> 3627.70s]  What's the one? All right. And this is, this is one that I think is great. Which one? Here's
[3627.70s -> 3638.68s]  the final one I have. All right. There it is. This is a fun one. Hold on. I'm saving them.
[3639.16s -> 3655.18s]  Oh, I am. I'm a hundred percent American, 75% Irish, 60% water, 50 cents, biggest fan, 40 pounds
[3655.18s -> 3659.10s]  overweight, seven years from retirement and five minutes from having to shit at this lows.
[3663.50s -> 3671.75s]  This shirt sucks. Yeah, it does suck. This looks like an old like webpage from 1995.
[3672.79s -> 3678.33s]  Yeah. Yeah. It'd be like the, like the banner for like some shitty ass, you know,
[3678.89s -> 3687.74s]  blog form or whatever. What is this one? So this, this is what you've narrowed it down to.
[3688.68s -> 3695.26s]  Oh, I mean, I'll, I'll mull over a bit. Uh, you know, maybe chat can inspire me some more.
[3695.26s -> 3698.78s]  A lot of people want you to have this one. I'll, I'll send it to you, but I, I wouldn't do this to
[3698.78s -> 3705.03s]  you. Cause I think this one's abhorrent. I think just even owning this is a bit of an atrocity.
[3705.03s -> 3710.63s]  What am I owning? If you like owned this, cause you'd wear it. Obviously you'd have to, I don't
[3710.63s -> 3715.75s]  want that one. I don't want this one. I know. That's why I'm saying I don't want, I don't want
[3715.75s -> 3721.43s]  this one. No, I know. Please spare me. Please spare me. I'll wear the cum shirt. I'll wear the
[3721.43s -> 3730.25s]  cum shirt. Okay. I'm serious. I'm not wearing this one. Where is it? I, I, I, no, no, no. Okay. All
[3730.25s -> 3736.18s]  right. I'll know. I would, anyone, but this one, if chat was to decide, that's what they would do.
[3736.18s -> 3740.92s]  They would put that one on your body, but I wouldn't do that to you. Cause I understand there's,
[3740.92s -> 3751.77s]  you know, there's lines, but I'll, I'll mull it over. I'll have to look at this mega milk a bit
[3751.77s -> 3757.61s]  more. I got, I got, I got $70 and you got to humiliate me in front of everybody. Yeah. It does
[3757.61s -> 3763.61s]  seem a bit imbalanced. Doesn't it? What's a monetary equivalent to how much you wear that
[3763.61s -> 3770.54s]  shirt on stream for 70 bucks. I've worn that shirt for free. I paid for it. Yeah. You've worn the
[3770.54s -> 3776.62s]  pizza, pizza one with the, yeah. So I do an Amazon stream and I, and I let them buy anything
[3776.62s -> 3782.06s]  and I only get three vetoes. So I could veto that shirt or I could veto like a $10,000 engagement
[3782.06s -> 3793.03s]  ring. So I, you know, I have to pick my battles. Hold on people. That's so funny, dude. They just
[3793.03s -> 3798.49s]  link whatever they want. And let me tell you that you buy cars on Amazon. You can, yes you can. You
[3798.49s -> 3807.22s]  can buy a Chevy, a Ford. That's so funny, dude. All right. That's amazing. The category of
[3807.22s -> 3814.34s]  battleship has blown up. Checking the battleship category. Let's see it. Oh, it's, it's, it's gone
[3814.34s -> 3819.62s]  off the deep end. It's there's, there's just someone with a mega milk shirt. You want to play
[3819.62s -> 3825.43s]  among us. These people, you're all going to get banned. You remember Bukaki 4k webcam.
[3825.91s -> 3833.91s]  You guys are all going to get your like channels banned. Look at this guy. It's a big Jerma
[3833.91s -> 3843.59s]  supporter. Go Jerma go. This dog's pretty cute. One of these guys has like a hundred viewers.
[3845.08s -> 3851.37s]  Yeah. The losing 50, 50. Yeah. The person playing among us says it's doing, doing well actually.
[3851.37s -> 3856.90s]  Yeah. They're, I think they're just playing among us. This one's just trying to get you to add an
[3856.90s -> 3867.78s]  emote. Jerma Sag. This person is jerking off on stream. Can you define zirking for me? It's from
[3867.78s -> 3871.86s]  that streamer simulator game where everything, everything had a Z replaced at the front of the
[3871.86s -> 3879.70s]  word. Right. That is a good game. It is pretty good. This is an auto emote. I can't keep track.
[3879.70s -> 3887.54s]  Chicken McNugget. I'm looking at you kissing, uh, Chuck E. Cheese. Did you ever hear the story of
[3887.54s -> 3892.94s]  that? Of you kissing Chuck E. Cheese? Yeah. Oh yeah. I'm not familiar with that. No. Chuck E.
[3892.94s -> 3899.45s]  Cheese raided the channel like last year. Oh, like the corporation. Like actually like Chuck E.
[3899.45s -> 3903.93s]  Cheese was streaming Fall Guys or something and he like raided a host of the channel and somebody
[3903.93s -> 3907.53s]  said, put this on stream. And I said, what is it? And I, and I, I didn't like really want to put it
[3907.53s -> 3910.41s]  on stream, but like, I just did it anyways. And like, I think I, I think I fucked up and put it
[3910.41s -> 3916.98s]  on twice. Um, it was me kissing Chuck E. Cheese, like on the lips and they had already had it made.
[3916.98s -> 3920.34s]  It was already, it was already ready. They had me kissing Chuck E. Cheese. But the funniest part
[3920.34s -> 3926.41s]  about it is the Chuck E. Cheese stock price tanked when the image showed up on stream.
[3926.41s -> 3932.60s]  Like actually like in real, like actually the real stock went down. Like when Cristiano Ronaldo said,
[3932.60s -> 3936.28s]  I don't drink Coke and the stock plummeted, you have the same effect on Chuck E. Cheese.
[3936.28s -> 3940.60s]  But like, I don't think that's what happened. I think they had like some kind of announcement
[3940.60s -> 3945.00s]  or some kind of news or somebody like sold for some reason. And like, it just happened to line
[3945.00s -> 3952.20s]  up to like the 10 minute window of me showing it on stream. I like to imagine the largest Chuck E.
[3952.20s -> 3958.68s]  Cheese shareholder just watches you, you know, for entertainment and then happened to see that
[3958.68s -> 3964.34s]  and thought, you know what, it's, it's time to pull out. It's time. I don't think it was related
[3964.34s -> 3970.95s]  at all though. It was like just some weird, hilarious coincidence. I think what is this?
[3970.95s -> 3975.88s]  So what, all right. So what are the stakes of the next one? If we're going to keep upping the stakes
[3975.88s -> 3980.57s]  here and then now what, how do we go from, how do we, how do we add to, to the stakes?
[3982.46s -> 3987.74s]  How do we add to the stakes? So look, we, we flipped off money. We can, we can go back to money.
[3989.19s -> 3993.86s]  You want to go, you want to go back to cash? We could do like, uh, I think it's time.
[3993.86s -> 4001.53s]  We could do the a hundred gifted match. Okay. Cause I think the, if we're escalating shirts,
[4001.53s -> 4008.98s]  that then it goes outfits. Then, then one of us is going to become a cat made for a day.
[4008.98s -> 4017.67s]  Have you worn a cat girl costume before? No, I haven't. You haven't?
[4020.23s -> 4026.28s]  Bugleberry, right? That's, that's my answer. If I looked up for instance, like cat boy,
[4027.00s -> 4034.95s]  you would find plenty of material. That's for sure. That is a lot of it. That's more fan art
[4034.95s -> 4040.02s]  than times you've worn it. Surely. Oh yeah. Probably by a hundred times. That's crazy.
[4040.02s -> 4048.30s]  Fan fiction goes a long way. Uh, are you, are you getting the rematch? Oh yeah. Sorry. I, uh,
[4049.34s -> 4055.10s]  Oh, there he is clubbing, but I'm happy to do a 100 gifted match. You want to do a hundred gifted
[4055.10s -> 4059.86s]  subs? I think that's a, that's a strategy. All right. All right. A hundred gifted subs. Let's do
[4059.86s -> 4067.42s]  it. Okay. Sir Philip Wade. He's never lost. This is really important. This is, this is for a lot
[4067.42s -> 4105.13s]  of money. Do this. I'm ready. I'm not ready. I'm not ready. Hold on. This is a bad strat.
[4105.77s -> 4126.38s]  Is that good everybody? That's weird, right? That's like a weird one that he won't ever figure it
[4126.38s -> 4140.97s]  out. No, you're throwing. No, I'm not. I don't think he's going to get this. I think this is
[4140.97s -> 4158.23s]  the winner right here. I really do. That's the winner. God. Are you happy with yours?
[4158.23s -> 4165.34s]  I am as happy as I think I could be. I think my chap bullied me out of my strategy, which was a
[4165.34s -> 4170.70s]  straight line up the middle. I, you probably would have won. That was a mistake. I I'm, I'm kind of
[4170.70s -> 4175.58s]  like a frog brain. I probably wouldn't have done it. Uh, I think you've gone back to being a corner
[4175.58s -> 4187.66s]  Karen. See what if you went, what if you did this though? What if you went right in the middle?
[4191.54s -> 4194.74s]  If you get this, okay. All right. Save. All right. I got this. I know where you are
[4195.96s -> 4211.51s]  living another day. I have a fine amount of time before you hit. I gotta make this count. Oh no.
[4211.51s -> 4218.15s]  Oh God. All right. All right. So here's your destroyer right here. Oh no, you went down. Yep.
[4218.15s -> 4231.29s]  Yep. I think, I think you try. I think you're avoiding all the edges. Corner Karen is this a
[4231.29s -> 4235.61s]  waste of my time. I feel like I'm wasting this. You're not a corner. Karen, maybe you avoid it.
[4235.61s -> 4239.53s]  Not in those corners, not in those corners. Oh, you're trying to get me to click the last
[4239.53s -> 4243.77s]  corner, but I'm, I'm too smart. I'm never going to click the last corner. Well, then I guess
[4243.77s -> 4254.17s]  you're never going to win the game. You've swayed me. You're a villain. What if I told you something
[4254.17s -> 4262.14s]  was right next to my destroyer? It probably is. I'll get there eventually. Don't worry. I'm just,
[4262.14s -> 4272.46s]  I'm just saying what if I told you not that I'm not telling you that. Okay. Oh, all right. All
[4272.46s -> 4279.54s]  right. But I mean, it could be anywhere. It would have been so bad ass if I had hit another ship.
[4279.54s -> 4284.50s]  Oh, you're just trying to be like, throw the, throw the ball behind your back and swish. Yeah.
[4284.50s -> 4290.74s]  I wanted to try to, that's, that was someone who has never seen basketball before. Try to explain
[4290.74s -> 4297.50s]  that. What? You said throw the ball behind the back and swish. It sounded like you'd never seen
[4297.50s -> 4302.38s]  the sport of basketball before. Oh no. I'm talking about like you, you like turn around and like face
[4302.38s -> 4307.18s]  away from the hoop and just throw it backwards and try and get a swish. Oh yeah. Just behind the
[4307.18s -> 4311.69s]  back. Yeah. Yeah. And absolute. It was a, it was a YOLO attempt. Oh, you thought I meant like,
[4311.69s -> 4315.21s]  oh yeah, the guy that like throws the ball around it back and goes into the hoop, that thing.
[4315.21s -> 4321.83s]  Like an announcer's first day on the job. Oh shit. Oh, all right. All right. I'll make a wager with
[4321.83s -> 4326.73s]  you. Oh wait, right now? No, no, no, no. I was going to say if you got the right direction,
[4326.73s -> 4333.13s]  I'd give you five subs. Oh shit. You, you got it. You got it. I feel good about that. I think,
[4333.85s -> 4339.24s]  if you land this next one right here, that just this next hit, it just has to be the next hit.
[4339.24s -> 4349.03s]  I'll wear the mega milk shirt tomorrow. Oh my God. Oh my God. I have a feeling your strategy
[4349.59s -> 4357.40s]  was having your ships go from the edge towards the center. So only one piece of it touches the edge.
[4357.40s -> 4365.08s]  I don't, I don't know. I don't think so right now by like my heart is like, oh, like kind of,
[4366.04s -> 4373.24s]  this is a bit stressful. Well, cause I, well, I didn't want to wear the mega milk shirt tomorrow.
[4373.24s -> 4377.08s]  Yeah. That would have been bad for you. It would have been. Oh, okay. Okay. Here, here, here.
[4377.08s -> 4381.56s]  All right. I will wager you five gifted. You don't know which direction I'm going here.
[4381.56s -> 4388.55s]  So if I hit, it's wrong. That's right. But if you miss, thank you. I'll get that. Yeah. I'll
[4388.55s -> 4396.60s]  get that right away. I do have to open your stream to give that though. Why don't we keep a tally so
[4396.60s -> 4400.98s]  that we can just remember later? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cause it is kind of like a, you have to like
[4401.46s -> 4405.62s]  this and then you're going to accept and then process and then I was saying, cause I would
[4405.62s -> 4414.52s]  see where you are. Oh, right. Yeah. Hey, don't do that. Hey, don't do that. Oh no. Are you
[4414.52s -> 4421.70s]  shitting me? Oh no. And it's right here. Are you shitting me? Oh no. You're in a lot of trouble.
[4421.70s -> 4427.91s]  I am in a lot of trouble. I think you've discovered my stratagem. Oh, you get another
[4427.91s -> 4432.95s]  one here. If you get at one right here, you're doing, you're doing like the, like the everybody's
[4432.95s -> 4439.93s]  facing in. No, no. I found you out. I was doing, it was a cross is, you know, like a,
[4439.93s -> 4447.58s]  like a Christian cross. Well, it's you're in a lot of trouble now. Well, you'll never get my two
[4447.58s -> 4457.22s]  boat. Imagine it's just in the center, linking everything that you were drawing. Uh, okay.
[4457.22s -> 4466.25s]  There we go. Oh, left, right. I'm actually, but oh no, maybe it's a tugboat going down.
[4466.25s -> 4470.33s]  So this, this might take me a while because it's just your two boat. That's the only thing.
[4470.73s -> 4475.88s]  It's just my two boat and it should realistically take you about 10 shots
[4475.88s -> 4489.83s]  to get here. Realistically. But it's too bad that it's right here. It's too bad that it's right
[4489.83s -> 4496.42s]  here. I thought you were going to do a thing where it's like up. That was a dangerous shot.
[4496.42s -> 4501.75s]  Oh, cause now you've left the corner open. Can you do it? Can you do it? Can you do it?
[4501.75s -> 4508.30s]  Toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat. Toy boat,
[4508.30s -> 4512.55s]  toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat. That's another time gift it's up.
[4512.55s -> 4515.77s]  You practice you're embarrassing me now. I
[4516.53s -> 4524.35s]  Have actually have I do that all the time. They have a lot of practice that was actually really good for a first-timer
[4524.35s -> 4525.89s]  I'll tell you
[4525.89s -> 4530.77s]  Yeah, you guys are like meet meetings you do meetups. Oh some people people can't even get past the second one
[4530.77s -> 4535.91s]  That was pretty good. That really was I'm serious. I appreciate that. I used to do when I was younger
[4536.15s -> 4539.22s]  There's some French tongue twisters. You could try
[4540.90s -> 4548.22s]  It's so it's um the the English translations if your uncle shaves your uncle
[4548.46s -> 4552.86s]  Uncle be shaved but in French it sounds like it's very literal
[4553.84s -> 4567.36s]  The French one is sit on m
[4567.36s -> 4570.51s]  Oh, say it again. Yeah, I want to hear that again.
[4571.51s -> 4572.49s]  On your pizzeria.
[4580.36s -> 4581.26s]  Say it again?
[4582.14s -> 4582.94s]  It's, so it's
[4583.62s -> 4584.60s]  that's yours.
[4585.80s -> 4586.76s]  That's how you say uncle.
[4588.10s -> 4589.48s]  Tom, which is shave
[4590.49s -> 4590.97s]  Tongue your
[4591.45s -> 4592.53s]  Tom Tom
[4596.04s -> 4596.82s]  will be shaved.
[4596.82s -> 4600.12s]  I feel like the Charlie Brown parents talking...
[4604.20s -> 4605.69s]  ...don't you.
[4605.69s -> 4607.69s]  We are now just the adults.
[4607.69s -> 4610.70s]  We can't communicate with the children anymore.
[4610.70s -> 4615.07s]  Uhhh...
[4615.07s -> 4617.43s]  Did you still have a destroyer somewhere?
[4617.43s -> 4618.82s]  There we go.
[4618.82s -> 4619.82s]  That wasn't a Family Guy joke.
[4619.82s -> 4620.42s]  That was literally...
[4620.42s -> 4623.70s]  He just said a thing in French.
[4623.70s -> 4625.20s]  They're calling my joke a Family Guy joke?
[4625.20s -> 4626.20s]  It just said Family Guy joke.
[4626.20s -> 4626.70s]  I know.
[4626.70s -> 4627.70s]  It's unbelievable.
[4627.70s -> 4628.78s]  I can't believe them.
[4628.78s -> 4629.68s]  Every...
[4629.68s -> 4632.38s]  Everything we try to do on this platform,
[4632.38s -> 4635.48s]  Peter fucking Griffin is already done.
[4635.48s -> 4636.88s]  I can't believe he's not in Fortnite.
[4636.88s -> 4638.98s]  I was so sad when he didn't get in.
[4638.98s -> 4640.74s]  Oh, you got him.
[4640.74s -> 4642.04s]  Wait, that's huge for me.
[4642.04s -> 4642.54s]  That actually...
[4642.54s -> 4643.58s]  That's very big.
[4643.68s -> 4648.79s]  This could be a comeback of epic proportions.
[4648.79s -> 4651.48s]  I'm actually kind of nervous because,
[4651.48s -> 4652.18s]  like you said,
[4652.18s -> 4655.08s]  I have to find just your little two guy.
[4655.08s -> 4655.38s]  Yeah.
[4655.38s -> 4658.22s]  And that could be anywhere.
[4658.22s -> 4662.52s]  I...
[4662.52s -> 4665.92s]  I do think you have a strategy that might be in my favor here.
[4665.92s -> 4672.06s]  Oh, it could be anywhere.
[4672.06s -> 4676.55s]  It's gonna take me forever to find this.
[4676.55s -> 4679.48s]  Alright, I just have to...
[4679.48s -> 4680.68s]  I have to rein it in.
[4680.68s -> 4684.74s]  Just focus.
[4684.74s -> 4690.38s]  It's gonna be, like, in a weird place, like...
[4690.38s -> 4704.48s]  I'm trying to clear every 5x area.
[4704.58s -> 4707.08s]  Why is everybody saying Aaron?
[4707.08s -> 4707.48s]  I'm not gonna do that.
[4707.48s -> 4708.08s]  Aaron?
[4708.08s -> 4708.98s]  No, I'm not gonna...
[4708.98s -> 4710.88s]  I'm not gonna embarrass myself in front of Ludwig.
[4710.88s -> 4711.66s]  No.
[4711.66s -> 4713.46s]  Wait, what's Aaron?
[4713.46s -> 4713.96s]  It's just...
[4713.96s -> 4717.51s]  It's this thing that people like that I say.
[4717.51s -> 4718.21s]  Do what?
[4718.21s -> 4718.81s]  Say it.
[4718.81s -> 4721.48s]  Okay, have you ever watched Attack on Titan?
[4721.48s -> 4722.08s]  Yeah, of course.
[4722.08s -> 4722.88s]  Okay, have you watched...
[4722.88s -> 4725.50s]  The dub of Attack on Titan or the sub?
[4725.50s -> 4728.80s]  I think I've watched both, but mostly the sub.
[4728.80s -> 4730.50s]  But I think my first season was dubbed.
[4730.50s -> 4734.68s]  So you've seen, like, the dubbed actors in the show?
[4734.68s -> 4735.38s]  Yes, yeah.
[4735.38s -> 4737.18s]  So if I were to go like this...
[4737.18s -> 4739.68s]  Aaron! Aaron! Aaron!
[4739.68s -> 4740.28s]  You would know what that was?
[4740.28s -> 4740.78s]  Yeah.
[4740.78s -> 4741.38s]  Okay.
[4741.38s -> 4746.80s]  I would imagine that's the blonde twerp.
[4746.80s -> 4747.60s]  You're...
[4747.60s -> 4748.10s]  What the fuck?
[4748.10s -> 4749.20s]  You just hit two.
[4749.20s -> 4751.97s]  What the hell's going on here?
[4751.97s -> 4753.53s]  Am I right?
[4753.53s -> 4755.87s]  Yes, that would be Armin Arlott.
[4755.87s -> 4758.42s]  Yeah, that's him.
[4758.42s -> 4759.12s]  I like that show.
[4759.12s -> 4760.02s]  Do you like that show?
[4760.02s -> 4761.35s]  I do.
[4761.35s -> 4762.75s]  Do you watch a lot of anime?
[4762.75s -> 4764.87s]  Do you consider yourself...?
[4764.87s -> 4765.47s]  Once a year.
[4765.47s -> 4767.37s]  I get myself one anime a year.
[4767.37s -> 4769.90s]  That's what I'm allowed to do.
[4769.90s -> 4773.48s]  That's just so you don't become a weeb or...?
[4773.48s -> 4776.78s]  It's just because at time and, you know, there's a million animes.
[4776.78s -> 4779.11s]  You get sucked in, you watch like a hundred of them.
[4779.11s -> 4780.28s]  You're right.
[4780.28s -> 4783.26s]  I get myself one anime a year.
[4783.26s -> 4785.96s]  I only watch...
[4795.33s -> 4797.83s]  No! No, he's got it.
[4797.83s -> 4798.53s]  He's got it.
[4798.53s -> 4800.03s]  Just one more and he's got it.
[4800.03s -> 4801.23s]  Oh, thank the Lord.
[4801.23s -> 4801.93s]  Now I have to find it.
[4801.93s -> 4805.24s]  Everything's on to this.
[4805.24s -> 4805.54s]  Right.
[4805.54s -> 4810.02s]  It would be the greatest comeback of all time if you get this.
[4810.02s -> 4813.46s]  There are two places where it could be.
[4813.46s -> 4816.66s]  Because I don't think that you would put it this close.
[4816.66s -> 4818.40s]  I don't.
[4818.40s -> 4825.90s]  You're either right here, right here, or here.
[4825.90s -> 4830.08s]  You want a hint?
[4830.08s -> 4831.80s]  Uh...
[4831.80s -> 4834.30s]  No, I don't trust your hints.
[4834.30s -> 4835.20s]  I think you're one of these two.
[4835.20s -> 4837.97s]  Give you a hint.
[4837.97s -> 4845.02s]  Because this would be like a perfect map if it was like one of these two.
[4845.02s -> 4856.08s]  I'll give you a simple hint and this is honest.
[4856.08s -> 4860.95s]  Dude, that little tugboat, it was right next to my destroyers to the left of it.
[4860.95s -> 4864.31s]  Oh, no!
[4864.31s -> 4869.00s]  Oh, now I have to give you a hundred subs?
[4869.00s -> 4870.60s]  Let me tell you, you were right.
[4870.60s -> 4871.74s]  You called it.
[4871.84s -> 4875.44s]  You were like, oh, I've won these petty games for $75.
[4875.44s -> 4880.34s]  And I have to wear the fucking cum t-shirt and pay you $500.
[4880.34s -> 4882.04s]  This is exactly what happened.
[4882.04s -> 4886.54s]  Taking you for all your worth, your pride, your dignity, and your wallet.
[4886.54s -> 4887.84s]  I won the two games.
[4887.84s -> 4889.74s]  This is like the pool shark.
[4889.74s -> 4890.24s]  You know what I mean?
[4890.24s -> 4892.94s]  Like, oh, hey, how about the first game for 20 bucks?
[4892.94s -> 4894.84s]  And it's like, oh, man, I missed.
[4894.84s -> 4896.24s]  I suck at pool.
[4896.24s -> 4898.91s]  And then you just clean me out before I leave.
[4898.91s -> 4902.25s]  That's exactly the plan.
[4902.25s -> 4903.85s]  All right, well, draw it down.
[4903.85s -> 4906.35s]  I'll get it to you at the end of the stream.
[4906.35s -> 4907.25s]  Yeah, yeah, no rush.
[4907.25s -> 4908.75s]  No rush.
[4908.75s -> 4909.05s]  All right.
[4909.05s -> 4914.05s]  So how much higher can we go with this one?
[4914.05s -> 4920.35s]  So we could, we're going to reach a point of power creep where we've gone too high.
[4920.35s -> 4920.85s]  Yes.
[4923.54s -> 4925.94s]  And here's the thing about me.
[4925.94s -> 4929.04s]  I live my life by the gambler's philosophy.
[4929.04s -> 4933.84s]  So once I start to lose a little money, I'll dump my net worth till I get it back.
[4933.84s -> 4935.84s]  I don't think I'm the right guy to guide this ship.
[4935.84s -> 4941.55s]  I'll let you make the next bet.
[4941.55s -> 4943.74s]  Well, that was a money one.
[4943.74s -> 4945.40s]  Yeah, that was.
[4945.40s -> 4949.53s]  So what if we up the stakes into a non-money one?
[4949.53s -> 4951.47s]  What would it look like?
[4951.47s -> 4953.97s]  I'll throw out a couple of things that work.
[4953.97s -> 4957.70s]  One is a tweet.
[4957.70s -> 4960.60s]  A tweet of the of the of the person's choosing.
[4960.60s -> 4960.90s]  Uh-huh.
[4960.90s -> 4961.60s]  Yeah.
[4961.60s -> 4962.10s]  That's pretty good.
[4962.10s -> 4966.26s]  I would get a tweet on your Twitter.
[4966.26s -> 4968.19s]  Oh, those are rare.
[4968.19s -> 4969.29s]  Those are rare.
[4969.29s -> 4971.99s]  But it's it's it's pretty equal value.
[4971.99s -> 4974.19s]  I would say because you rarely tweet.
[4974.19s -> 4974.69s]  That's true.
[4974.69s -> 4978.79s]  And I tweet pretty much all the time with my sponsored shit.
[4978.79s -> 4981.99s]  Yeah, you probably have like five times the followers that I have.
[4981.99s -> 4983.19s]  But I have a few more followers.
[4983.19s -> 4983.59s]  Exactly.
[4983.59s -> 4987.69s]  So it's about even because the rarity versus the just the followers.
[4987.69s -> 4989.46s]  Okay, I like this one.
[4989.46s -> 4991.96s]  Yeah, we get to you get to craft a tweet.
[4991.96s -> 4997.40s]  Wait, is this like a so like it would be as if it was me tweeting, but you wrote the tweet.
[4997.40s -> 4998.00s]  Exactly.
[4998.00s -> 5001.80s]  Yeah, you would never be able to explain because you know, we have a good amount of viewers here.
[5001.80s -> 5004.10s]  But you know, we have hundreds of thousands of followers.
[5004.10s -> 5008.90s]  You'd never be able to explain to those followers why that was tweeted or be like,
[5008.90s -> 5012.00s]  oh, I had to tweet this because of some dumb bet.
[5012.00s -> 5015.58s]  Oh, yeah, it has to be like you just this is you talking.
[5015.58s -> 5017.38s]  I'm going to show you an example of a tweet.
[5017.38s -> 5022.88s]  I had to do because I lost a bet against, you know, disguised toast.
[5022.88s -> 5025.94s]  Yes, I had lost a wager to him.
[5026.04s -> 5028.54s]  And maybe this isn't the best to pull up on stream.
[5028.54s -> 5033.18s]  But but here's the tweet regardless.
[5033.18s -> 5035.64s]  I'm not a picture or video.
[5035.64s -> 5040.84s]  Yes, but I would say I won't go as harsh as as as toasted.
[5040.84s -> 5041.84s]  Do you see the tweet?
[5041.84s -> 5044.44s]  Oh, let me see.
[5044.44s -> 5046.34s]  I saw the pizza thing.
[5046.34s -> 5049.59s]  What is this underwear?
[5049.59s -> 5051.29s]  Is this you?
[5051.29s -> 5052.39s]  This is my ass.
[5052.39s -> 5054.99s]  It's a picture of me in briefs with the caption.
[5054.99s -> 5060.01s]  Anyone want to sniff what the fuck?
[5060.01s -> 5065.47s]  Toast was not he was not exactly gracious and victory.
[5065.47s -> 5068.83s]  He was quite merciless.
[5068.83s -> 5071.75s]  Anyone want a sniff?
[5071.75s -> 5075.27s]  Yeah, and it's a picture of my butt in briefs.
[5075.27s -> 5078.57s]  Okay, because I was going to say I was going to like just have you take a picture of like
[5078.57s -> 5082.10s]  an apple core and just have the like the text over B.
[5082.10s -> 5084.16s]  What the fuck, dude?
[5084.16s -> 5087.60s]  And I mean, like something that like, yeah, that's what I was going to have you do.
[5087.60s -> 5089.30s]  No, that's that's what I would go for.
[5089.30s -> 5092.80s]  I would I would this this is, you know, toast went all out.
[5092.80s -> 5094.70s]  I'm showing you this is like this is a high end.
[5094.70s -> 5098.17s]  You know, it's probably like this is where it caps out.
[5098.17s -> 5101.07s]  I'm not expecting this or going to do this if I won.
[5101.07s -> 5104.27s]  And I don't I would hope, you know, you wouldn't do this to me if you won.
[5104.27s -> 5106.97s]  It's more so an example of a tweet in the past.
[5106.97s -> 5107.27s]  Okay.
[5107.27s -> 5107.67s]  Hold on.
[5107.67s -> 5108.97s]  I got to show this because it's important.
[5108.97s -> 5113.25s]  I didn't even show it yet.
[5113.25s -> 5120.38s]  There's maybe no eyebrows, but don't look at that one yet.
[5120.38s -> 5125.64s]  That's a great thing to have right there.
[5125.64s -> 5126.54s]  Just pull up your shoe.
[5126.54s -> 5127.34s]  That's a bit of a zoom.
[5127.34s -> 5130.24s]  Actually, that's going on.
[5130.24s -> 5131.14s]  This is your ass.
[5131.14s -> 5132.85s]  What what are you doing?
[5132.85s -> 5138.96s]  I'm staring at a portrait of myself.
[5138.96s -> 5141.16s]  By the way, I think that you have been the first person
[5141.16s -> 5145.06s]  to ever have me show the word of become on my screen, by the way.
[5145.06s -> 5147.76s]  Just want to make sure we're clear on that one.
[5147.76s -> 5151.32s]  Should I be ashamed or proud?
[5151.32s -> 5152.92s]  Probably probably both.
[5152.92s -> 5155.88s]  It's a mixture.
[5155.88s -> 5157.18s]  All right.
[5157.18s -> 5158.18s]  So I think that's it.
[5158.18s -> 5159.28s]  That's a fair wager.
[5159.28s -> 5160.58s]  Oh, that's fair.
[5160.58s -> 5163.33s]  Did you just purchase Sir Philip Wade?
[5163.33s -> 5165.51s]  No, I didn't buy anything.
[5165.51s -> 5168.71s]  It shows on my screen that you're playing a Sir Philip Wade.
[5168.71s -> 5169.31s]  Wait, what?
[5169.31s -> 5172.62s]  Yeah, what's going on?
[5172.62s -> 5176.22s]  What's this?
[5176.22s -> 5178.40s]  This is you?
[5178.40s -> 5179.90s]  Yeah, I think this is we're in the same game.
[5179.90s -> 5184.70s]  But for whatever reason, all right, I have a genius strategy
[5184.70s -> 5186.96s]  to line my ships here.
[5186.96s -> 5189.16s]  Can you give me a number between one and ten, please?
[5189.16s -> 5199.93s]  Three.
[5199.93s -> 5202.43s]  Now, are you under the impression that Battleship is somewhat
[5202.43s -> 5203.63s]  of a skilled game?
[5203.63s -> 5207.01s]  Yes, I think it's very I think this is going to be huge.
[5207.01s -> 5207.41s]  Okay.
[5207.41s -> 5208.57s]  Yeah.
[5208.57s -> 5210.07s]  Do you not think so?
[5210.07s -> 5211.97s]  No, it's not just asking questions.
[5211.97s -> 5215.98s]  Yeah, like we are.
[5215.98s -> 5218.78s]  This is like a this is a pre-show how everybody is going to
[5218.78s -> 5219.78s]  be playing this.
[5219.78s -> 5221.18s]  This is a huge deal, right?
[5221.18s -> 5222.38s]  Like everyone's going to love this game.
[5222.38s -> 5225.39s]  Everyone's going to get into it.
[5225.39s -> 5228.69s]  Roof to you that this is a game made for children that that,
[5228.69s -> 5233.62s]  you know, actual just trained monkeys would do better in.
[5233.62s -> 5238.42s]  I've randomly placed my ships and I'm using a random picker
[5238.42s -> 5245.14s]  to shoot your ships down randomized shot randomized placements
[5245.14s -> 5250.21s]  against your strategies.
[5250.21s -> 5257.30s]  So it will see if I was able to win with pure randomness that
[5257.30s -> 5258.10s]  I proved to you.
[5258.10s -> 5263.18s]  This is a game for little baby boy children.
[5263.18s -> 5265.28s]  My strategy is not good.
[5265.28s -> 5287.25s]  The best way to go about this is to do it twice, which is
[5287.25s -> 5288.85s]  there's no way.
[5288.85s -> 5291.65s]  I mean, no, there is no way you know where you can get it.
[5291.65s -> 5302.19s]  It's that yeah, that's one space.
[5302.19s -> 5306.88s]  That was another another bat behind the back swish attempt.
[5306.88s -> 5310.38s]  I'm random number generating every single hit you are.
[5310.38s -> 5314.40s]  Yeah, what?
[5314.40s -> 5315.71s]  Yes.
[5315.71s -> 5321.73s]  So every time I hit so you'd randomly generating the number
[5321.73s -> 5322.43s]  and the letter.
[5322.43s -> 5326.20s]  Yeah, I'm just basically doing to one through tens and then
[5326.20s -> 5333.04s]  just cow first down and then over well shit.
[5333.04s -> 5334.94s]  That's a huge advantage for me.
[5334.94s -> 5336.17s]  We'll see.
[5336.17s -> 5347.05s]  I have a feeling that this is an impeccable strategy and actually
[5347.05s -> 5351.08s]  might be very good in 95% of every game.
[5360.40s -> 5363.97s]  Are you committing to this the whole game?
[5363.97s -> 5370.64s]  I think I might follow up on some of the reds because random
[5370.64s -> 5372.54s]  number generators don't do well after a hit.
[5372.54s -> 5373.14s]  Mm-hmm.
[5373.14s -> 5380.82s]  Oh, no.
[5380.82s -> 5383.53s]  All right.
[5383.53s -> 5384.13s]  You're right here.
[5384.13s -> 5386.06s]  You always put one here.
[5386.06s -> 5387.06s]  Oh, no.
[5387.06s -> 5387.66s]  What?
[5387.66s -> 5388.46s]  That's your poker face.
[5388.46s -> 5389.66s]  You always discovered me.
[5389.66s -> 5390.36s]  Yeah.
[5390.36s -> 5391.16s]  All right.
[5391.16s -> 5392.36s]  Or North South East West.
[5392.36s -> 5395.16s]  That doesn't matter how many pairs of hoods and sunglasses
[5395.16s -> 5395.56s]  you put on.
[5395.56s -> 5396.56s]  I can see right through this.
[5396.56s -> 5397.66s]  I know you have one here every time.
[5397.66s -> 5404.73s]  All right.
[5404.73s -> 5408.26s]  North South East or West North North South East or West
[5408.26s -> 5408.86s]  North again.
[5409.70s -> 5410.20s]  There we go.
[5410.20s -> 5412.10s]  Oh, all right.
[5412.10s -> 5412.50s]  All right.
[5412.98s -> 5417.69s]  Let me do one more random and then I'm going to try following
[5417.69s -> 5417.99s]  up.
[5420.28s -> 5420.68s]  Yeah.
[5421.78s -> 5423.08s]  The longer this goes the worse.
[5423.08s -> 5424.28s]  I feel like my strategy is.
[5425.50s -> 5428.50s]  Okay, there goes your destroyer, but that's the easiest one.
[5428.70s -> 5429.50s]  I want to find you.
[5429.50s -> 5429.90s]  This one.
[5434.22s -> 5438.06s]  Oh, I still think you did something like that.
[5438.06s -> 5440.68s]  I'm bad at counting.
[5440.68s -> 5441.28s]  It turns out.
[5446.11s -> 5446.51s]  Hmm.
[5448.30s -> 5452.06s]  I think I think you did something like this.
[5452.06s -> 5452.86s]  I really do.
[5453.36s -> 5456.36s]  Well, you have to understand I'm not lying to you.
[5456.36s -> 5457.76s]  I randomized it.
[5460.20s -> 5460.80s]  Oh, okay.
[5460.80s -> 5461.70s]  All right for this one.
[5461.70s -> 5462.70s]  Oh wait, you didn't.
[5462.70s -> 5463.70s]  Oh, I see what you mean.
[5464.20s -> 5466.10s]  And the ships were randomly placed.
[5466.10s -> 5466.90s]  Oh, all right.
[5466.90s -> 5468.70s]  So that actually is an advantage for me.
[5468.80s -> 5471.70s]  Although you coincidentally did get my destroyer.
[5475.50s -> 5476.40s]  Oh my gosh.
[5476.50s -> 5479.20s]  Yeah, if you go to the right here, this is brutal.
[5484.45s -> 5486.95s]  I'm thinking somebody faces into my face cam like every time
[5486.95s -> 5490.59s]  like I click I turn I go like I'm just such a good fucking
[5490.59s -> 5491.49s]  YouTube face.
[5493.09s -> 5496.09s]  All right, whatever you got you good reactions destroyer.
[5496.49s -> 5496.99s]  Okay.
[5497.59s -> 5498.19s]  Yeah.
[5498.19s -> 5499.19s]  Yeah, whatever.
[5500.99s -> 5501.39s]  All right.
[5502.41s -> 5503.21s]  Seven six.
[5507.44s -> 5507.94s]  All right.
[5508.04s -> 5510.54s]  Well, whatever you got that one where we're even now.
[5510.74s -> 5514.04s]  It's perfectly even unless you happened to hit something
[5514.04s -> 5514.44s]  here.
[5514.74s -> 5517.01s]  Oh, you don't.
[5522.92s -> 5527.76s]  Oh, this would be a funny one funny one.
[5527.76s -> 5529.96s]  Why funny is there a Jason?
[5530.36s -> 5536.90s]  Yeah, that would be actually very funny humorous in a way.
[5537.60s -> 5538.80s]  That would be very funny.
[5539.67s -> 5543.71s]  I get it was randomly generated ships and it would be
[5543.81s -> 5546.01s]  it would freak me out if you actually did that that'd be
[5546.01s -> 5546.71s]  so funny.
[5548.09s -> 5548.49s]  Okay.
[5548.69s -> 5549.09s]  All right.
[5549.49s -> 5551.09s]  I might abandon my strategy here.
[5552.47s -> 5555.07s]  I'm realizing this this guy I might swing over to your
[5555.07s -> 5555.27s]  side.
[5555.27s -> 5556.27s]  This could be a game of skill.
[5556.37s -> 5558.07s]  It's incredibly frivolous what you're up to.
[5558.90s -> 5559.70s]  How are you not down there?
[5560.86s -> 5562.86s]  I don't know.
[5562.96s -> 5563.16s]  Okay.
[5563.16s -> 5564.26s]  You hate the edges.
[5564.26s -> 5578.09s]  You love the center fail again and for what right I left
[5578.09s -> 5583.98s]  the right you're right.
[5584.38s -> 5585.18s]  Yeah, this is it right here.
[5585.48s -> 5587.18s]  Oh, come on.
[5588.50s -> 5592.68s]  I tried to sway you with the left or right.
[5593.35s -> 5595.35s]  Yeah, I would I would say you're flailing right now.
[5595.35s -> 5603.45s]  If it were me what is on the line here a tweet a tweet what
[5603.45s -> 5607.52s]  I would love to tweet on your Twitter account for sure.
[5611.51s -> 5612.91s]  Finally, it's my turn.
[5618.51s -> 5620.11s]  I think the computer went that way.
[5622.41s -> 5624.21s]  You think the computer has rhyme or reason.
[5624.31s -> 5629.02s]  Oh fuck a phenomenal hit that was randomly generated.
[5629.52s -> 5633.99s]  Oh, did you did you t-bone yourself t-bone?
[5633.99s -> 5634.59s]  What does that mean?
[5635.22s -> 5639.60s]  Like did you put a ship going into your ship so that it
[5639.60s -> 5644.17s]  would be a collision that would be very unwise.
[5645.10s -> 5648.10s]  Oh, you connected it to you actually t-boned yourself.
[5650.26s -> 5652.36s]  There's no confirmation that that's what happened.
[5652.96s -> 5656.92s]  Well, if there's a what do you think the ship pulls a
[5656.92s -> 5658.12s]  last-second left turn?
[5658.12s -> 5659.32s]  It's an L-shaped ship.
[5659.80s -> 5660.00s]  All right.
[5660.00s -> 5661.50s]  I'm gonna have to freeze Ludwig.
[5663.96s -> 5668.80s]  I have a feeling did you grow up Catholic at all?
[5669.30s -> 5672.44s]  Yeah, okay.
[5672.91s -> 5675.21s]  I thought per chance there was a there was a cross of
[5675.21s -> 5681.22s]  David or that doesn't make any sense of Christ.
[5681.82s -> 5682.42s]  Come on.
[5682.42s -> 5683.32s]  How are you not there?
[5683.82s -> 5685.02s]  Okay, back to my strat.
[5687.26s -> 5688.86s]  What a oh, I already done it.
[5690.06s -> 5691.06s]  Then I'll just do my own.
[5694.48s -> 5699.27s]  What's your favorite animal favorite animal?
[5699.27s -> 5703.37s]  What's your favorite animal is a zebra zebra finds a frog.
[5704.48s -> 5710.93s]  Why I kind of just like word you the the reason it's your
[5710.93s -> 5712.43s]  favorite is because of the word.
[5712.43s -> 5714.43s]  I've enjoyed the word especially the letters.
[5717.02s -> 5718.22s]  I love that green frog.
[5721.92s -> 5731.74s]  Are you hinting at something could it be?
[5734.23s -> 5736.33s]  Does he need more tweets?
[5741.08s -> 5742.48s]  What did your computer do?
[5747.28s -> 5749.18s]  That was a terrible shot by the computer.
[5752.71s -> 5754.11s]  No, I'm all right.
[5754.21s -> 5754.81s]  It's right here.
[5755.69s -> 5756.69s]  How is it possible?
[5756.69s -> 5758.09s]  They all have probably up top.
[5760.21s -> 5767.81s]  I would never say you definitely there's no way you're
[5767.81s -> 5769.94s]  not up here somewhere.
[5770.24s -> 5772.04s]  This thing is statistically impossible.
[5772.34s -> 5778.28s]  I promise you that northbound will be in your your undoing
[5780.04s -> 5780.54s]  you think so.
[5780.54s -> 5781.84s]  There's no way you're here.
[5790.84s -> 5797.27s]  With these apps could a strategy be so simple that he's
[5797.27s -> 5799.77s]  trying to get me to go in the effort where nothing is.
[5806.76s -> 5807.76s]  Oh my God.
[5819.32s -> 5820.52s]  What are you up to over there?
[5820.52s -> 5822.02s]  Jerma nothing nothing.
[5826.22s -> 5830.86s]  I could really take this home, but I'm going in everything
[5830.86s -> 5833.66s]  that every place that you're not is impossible.
[5834.62s -> 5836.19s]  That's a re redo.
[5839.04s -> 5840.14s]  Is that random or was that you?
[5841.14s -> 5844.44s]  I had it had already been on that spot the one that it
[5844.44s -> 5844.84s]  selected.
[5844.84s -> 5847.42s]  So I went it's kind of my rule.
[5847.52s -> 5850.02s]  It's random unless it already had picked it picked one
[5850.02s -> 5850.92s]  that's already been shot.
[5861.47s -> 5861.77s]  All right.
[5861.77s -> 5863.67s]  You have just have little ones left right here.
[5864.47s -> 5866.17s]  I got a couple little ones.
[5866.17s -> 5866.97s]  Yeah, that's right.
[5867.17s -> 5869.37s]  I mean you have just a lot left.
[5869.37s -> 5871.07s]  I do have quite a bit ones currently.
[5871.07s -> 5872.17s]  You have right on this one.
[5875.34s -> 5877.75s]  Maybe you have a four somewhere.
[5877.75s -> 5877.95s]  All right.
[5877.95s -> 5879.35s]  This is this is me going here.
[5880.25s -> 5891.56s]  I could cover that was such a bad shot.
[5892.16s -> 5893.26s]  It was just a bad shot.
[5895.70s -> 5899.96s]  Oh, oh, come on.
[5900.26s -> 5900.86s]  There's no more.
[5900.86s -> 5902.36s]  How many more places can you be?
[5903.46s -> 5904.26s]  Three two.
[5909.74s -> 5915.04s]  I think well, you've you've left entire sections open.
[5916.67s -> 5919.70s]  Yeah, maybe a little bit or three.
[5919.70s -> 5922.70s]  What a terrible what a terrible follow-up.
[5922.70s -> 5925.80s]  There's this is the worst randomly generated shot of all
[5925.80s -> 5926.10s]  time.
[5926.10s -> 5929.90s]  It only hits a tugboat that just happens to be adjacent.
[5933.10s -> 5934.70s]  Maybe you are like right here.
[5936.93s -> 5941.93s]  No one three.
[5942.23s -> 5943.73s]  They're actually screwing me.
[5944.43s -> 5946.13s]  Look, you see I've done like a row.
[5946.53s -> 5948.23s]  I'm just cleaning out entire row.
[5951.84s -> 5955.14s]  I'm suddenly thinking the strategy is not impeccable.
[5956.67s -> 5957.97s]  I think that's we've already done that.
[5958.57s -> 5959.17s]  Yeah, we have.
[5959.17s -> 5959.57s]  Okay.
[5959.57s -> 5960.27s]  It's me again.
[5960.81s -> 5964.21s]  Do you let's let's let's clear out.
[5965.46s -> 5969.53s]  Let's clear out this one here covers up and down for three.
[5970.87s -> 5971.27s]  Hmm.
[5973.19s -> 5977.10s]  I have to assume that you're because you have a two, you know
[5977.10s -> 5980.30s]  what I like, but you have to understand this was not me.
[5980.84s -> 5981.64s]  This was not you.
[5981.64s -> 5982.24s]  That's right.
[5982.74s -> 5990.16s]  It doesn't matter if I'm a middle man in go in go.
[5991.84s -> 5992.14s]  All right.
[5992.14s -> 5996.41s]  There we go and eight.
[5996.41s -> 5997.41s]  We've already done that.
[6009.42s -> 6010.42s]  What are you laughing at?
[6010.92s -> 6014.30s]  Nothing just I mean, there's a bit of laughter.
[6014.40s -> 6016.70s]  It was a little bit of laughter, but it was kind of humorous
[6016.70s -> 6017.40s]  what just happened.
[6019.22s -> 6027.21s]  Me shooting was kind of humorous back back in this bullshit
[6027.21s -> 6027.41s]  again.
[6027.41s -> 6028.41s]  We're where your two is.
[6030.19s -> 6045.95s]  I mean, I guess you aren't random got one.
[6048.22s -> 6056.89s]  Is that the letter F was no what a terrible round to do
[6056.89s -> 6058.79s]  randomly generated shots on.
[6058.79s -> 6066.55s]  I know it's not over.
[6066.55s -> 6068.25s]  It's not even close to being over.
[6068.75s -> 6072.20s]  No, especially considering I found your two.
[6073.35s -> 6074.25s]  Well, good for me.
[6074.25s -> 6074.95s]  You did what?
[6075.25s -> 6084.76s]  No, it's not my two seven ten going in Shirley.
[6085.26s -> 6086.26s]  It has to be a three or two.
[6086.26s -> 6087.36s]  No, it's going up.
[6088.47s -> 6092.96s]  Damn it should have I shouldn't have talked myself out shit.
[6094.59s -> 6095.89s]  Okay, that you too.
[6096.19s -> 6098.25s]  No, no, this is a three.
[6098.25s -> 6099.05s]  It's up or down here.
[6099.55s -> 6099.95s]  Okay.
[6100.05s -> 6100.55s]  All right.
[6100.65s -> 6101.25s]  All right.
[6101.75s -> 6103.95s]  I got I got I got a nail this right now.
[6104.05s -> 6107.75s]  Okay, this you have struggled on twos before there are 3000
[6107.75s -> 6108.05s]  places.
[6108.05s -> 6115.12s]  This one could be there are but all right, you're going in.
[6116.30s -> 6117.40s]  I painted around this.
[6117.40s -> 6120.40s]  I've genuinely painted around this one the Lords.
[6120.70s -> 6121.00s]  All right.
[6121.00s -> 6122.20s]  You got a good shot here.
[6122.50s -> 6122.90s]  Okay.
[6123.79s -> 6124.39s]  And by good shot.
[6124.39s -> 6129.44s]  I mean it could be anywhere it could this could be B 10 C 10.
[6134.00s -> 6134.20s]  All right.
[6134.20s -> 6139.88s]  I'm going down now and that means the only ship left is a
[6139.88s -> 6140.78s]  three-man boat.
[6140.78s -> 6144.38s]  I don't think a randomly generated thing functions as well
[6144.38s -> 6144.88s]  anymore.
[6147.53s -> 6150.03s]  Cause there's there's three where is there a three is could
[6150.03s -> 6152.53s]  be this here doesn't places.
[6162.91s -> 6165.25s]  Yeah, that was a weird choice.
[6165.45s -> 6168.03s]  It was because you could have gotten left one and covered
[6168.03s -> 6168.33s]  more.
[6174.73s -> 6179.51s]  Okay, I'm a bit stressed out right now.
[6179.81s -> 6180.61s]  I am too.
[6188.64s -> 6190.34s]  This this covers a lot.
[6195.72s -> 6198.92s]  No, I have to think about this is no longer random surely
[6198.92s -> 6201.62s]  you didn't do anything to muddy the letter F.
[6201.82s -> 6205.80s]  So this must have been a displaced boat to have somewhat
[6205.80s -> 6213.58s]  of a coverage in case I found the F it could be like a J 3.
[6217.16s -> 6218.66s]  No, we should have done one more to the right.
[6219.59s -> 6221.59s]  It could be a really tall F.
[6222.70s -> 6225.81s]  I mean that would be interesting if I were to do something
[6225.81s -> 6226.61s]  like that, wouldn't it?
[6228.08s -> 6230.08s]  I can't tell if you're trying to convince me not to do it.
[6231.84s -> 6237.58s]  I guess I I thought the F was over but it could have just
[6237.58s -> 6238.38s]  been beginning.
[6240.00s -> 6241.40s]  I mean that was very interesting.
[6241.80s -> 6243.40s]  If I were you I would maybe take a shot.
[6246.28s -> 6247.48s]  Wait, you did do that.
[6247.48s -> 6252.28s]  Yeah, why don't you tell me that I was doing the psychology
[6252.28s -> 6253.78s]  thing where you're like, oh, why would you tell me?
[6255.98s -> 6258.58s]  I thought you're telling no, no have to tweet something.
[6260.18s -> 6266.55s]  What a tall F I was going to do the whole thing, but I figured
[6266.65s -> 6267.95s]  of course it was right there.
[6269.19s -> 6271.89s]  Yeah, the randomly generated was terrible.
[6271.89s -> 6274.39s]  I mean you didn't have the best stratagem for sure.
[6274.39s -> 6276.39s]  But I lost the last three in a row.
[6276.39s -> 6277.99s]  I won the first like two or three in a row.
[6279.14s -> 6279.94s]  You know what it is.
[6279.94s -> 6283.24s]  It's whoever gets the tugboat first almost just assuredly
[6283.24s -> 6283.74s]  wins.
[6283.74s -> 6288.14s]  Yeah, cuz finding the tugboat as the last thing is it's miserable.
[6289.98s -> 6290.88s]  It's the worst.
[6291.72s -> 6294.52s]  So I have a I have a I have a tweet now.
[6294.82s -> 6296.42s]  Yeah, you get to have a tweet.
[6296.96s -> 6298.76s]  This is this is valuable.
[6299.36s -> 6302.63s]  I mean, this is this is I tweet something maybe once every
[6302.63s -> 6303.73s]  like four months.
[6304.33s -> 6308.95s]  Yeah, you're not a the most avid Twitter user is a reason
[6308.95s -> 6309.45s]  for that.
[6310.24s -> 6312.54s]  Yeah, it's kind of you know, just don't care.
[6313.34s -> 6314.24s]  Yeah, sure.
[6315.74s -> 6318.04s]  You know, I think it is because I can never think of anything
[6318.04s -> 6320.74s]  to say I have somebody drafted tweets that is right and then
[6320.74s -> 6322.83s]  I just delete right.
[6323.13s -> 6326.23s]  See what I'll do is I'll send it and then I'll and I'll delete
[6326.23s -> 6331.50s]  it which I think is harder to do because sometimes after you
[6331.50s -> 6333.70s]  already said to you don't want to delete it which which makes
[6333.70s -> 6334.70s]  me tweet more often.
[6334.90s -> 6335.50s]  Exactly.
[6336.36s -> 6338.06s]  I'll read you my last two drafts.
[6338.46s -> 6339.06s]  Yeah, please.
[6339.86s -> 6342.86s]  Fortnite is starting to look a lot like those old Smash Brothers
[6342.86s -> 6345.96s]  character leak screens the ones with Heathcliff Pepper Anne
[6345.96s -> 6353.72s]  and Al Bundy on them in the other one if almonds are available
[6353.72s -> 6355.12s]  I'll eat them till I throw up.
[6363.00s -> 6363.60s]  All right.
[6364.86s -> 6365.96s]  Can you speak on that one?
[6368.42s -> 6370.12s]  I just I don't know if a bag of almonds is there.
[6370.12s -> 6371.62s]  I'm just going to keep eating him till somebody tells me
[6371.62s -> 6377.01s]  to stop eating them, but I didn't know those I did though
[6377.01s -> 6382.31s]  those I'm like, yeah, do you do you have the ability to
[6383.64s -> 6385.24s]  to protrude your stomach?
[6386.26s -> 6391.06s]  Yes, like in a pretty severe way that people would think,
[6391.06s -> 6392.46s]  you know, you're working on a baby.
[6392.94s -> 6396.44s]  Wait, you want you want a jokey stomach protruding like
[6396.44s -> 6399.94s]  in the okay, not just in a mirror like in the oven reflection
[6400.42s -> 6402.32s]  that you see and you go holy shit.
[6402.32s -> 6403.02s]  Is that me?
[6403.68s -> 6409.39s]  Yeah, is that something you're capable of doing?
[6409.96s -> 6411.66s]  Do you want a stomach protrusion picture?
[6411.66s -> 6414.62s]  Okay, how waste up full body?
[6415.16s -> 6419.06s]  I think a stomach protrusion picture with with your second
[6419.06s -> 6429.23s]  drafted tweet is you want that to be honest use you tweet
[6429.23s -> 6432.72s]  so rarely that anything is great here.
[6432.92s -> 6435.72s]  So you want if almonds are available.
[6436.02s -> 6438.72s]  I will eat them till I throw up and do the like I got a
[6438.72s -> 6440.12s]  big stomach picture.
[6440.22s -> 6444.40s]  Yeah, like, you know, kind of like how Twitter would be
[6444.40s -> 6446.90s]  used in like 2013.
[6448.20s -> 6448.80s]  God.
[6449.82s -> 6453.48s]  Okay, I'll do it.
[6454.02s -> 6457.32s]  Just I could eat almonds till I throw up and then you know,
[6457.32s -> 6459.82s]  your stomach so full because you've eaten so many almonds.
[6459.82s -> 6462.11s]  It's it's comical in a way.
[6464.83s -> 6465.23s]  All right.
[6465.63s -> 6466.43s]  This sounds good to me.
[6467.13s -> 6467.33s]  All right.
[6467.33s -> 6467.63s]  What do you want?
[6467.63s -> 6468.43s]  What do you want my hands?
[6469.62s -> 6472.62s]  Am I like like holding it like like underneath like it's
[6472.62s -> 6476.32s]  a big globe or like a big bug juggly or what am I doing?
[6476.76s -> 6481.28s]  I think you create creatively can can take this any direction
[6481.28s -> 6483.78s]  you want because I think you know what my sentiment what
[6483.78s -> 6487.58s]  my what my desire is here and you can you can get it done.
[6489.49s -> 6491.69s]  Somebody said this is literally fetish art.
[6494.11s -> 6499.26s]  It does feel like any time you even like any part of you
[6499.26s -> 6502.83s]  that you give out to your stream is just is just taken
[6502.83s -> 6504.33s]  and they just run with it.
[6504.53s -> 6506.73s]  There's going to be fan art for years on pregnant.
[6506.73s -> 6507.23s]  Germa.
[6510.48s -> 6511.68s]  I'll do my I'll do my best.
[6514.91s -> 6515.11s]  All right.
[6515.11s -> 6516.01s]  Can I go pee?
[6517.13s -> 6517.43s]  Yeah.
[6519.83s -> 6520.53s]  Yeah, please.
[6520.53s -> 6521.23s]  Please enjoy.
[6521.73s -> 6522.63s]  I'll be right back.
[6523.26s -> 6523.96s]  I'm going to go pee.
[6524.40s -> 6525.40s]  I'm looking forward to this.
[6526.07s -> 6526.87s]  Yeah, of course.
[6526.87s -> 6527.27s]  Of course.

[6763.10s -> 6763.60s]  I'm back.
[6766.70s -> 6768.30s]  It was one of those times where you pee.
[6768.40s -> 6773.76s]  It just doesn't stop.
[6773.96s -> 6774.46s]  You know what I mean?
[6780.56s -> 6781.86s]  Oh, did he just go afk?
[6785.48s -> 6785.78s]  All right.
[6785.78s -> 6786.58s]  Well, whatever we can wait.
[6786.58s -> 6795.28s]  We can have why you guys not playing the advanced game
[6795.28s -> 6795.88s]  mode.
[6799.72s -> 6804.84s]  I mean you play classic is an advanced game mode.
[6809.25s -> 6810.25s]  It will do that in a minute.
[6813.07s -> 6814.67s]  When we talked about doing the stream was just like,
[6814.67s -> 6816.37s]  oh, maybe we'll play this like 45 minutes.
[6816.77s -> 6817.57s]  Maybe do something else.
[6817.57s -> 6818.67s]  I'm very invested.
[6820.24s -> 6823.94s]  I have to try to at least make some what I may I got $70
[6823.94s -> 6825.44s]  the first like two or three games.
[6826.36s -> 6828.56s]  So let's let me get let's let's break this down a little bit.
[6828.96s -> 6832.96s]  So I won the first few games and I got 70 bucks.

[6839.13s -> 6840.93s]  and gets to make me wear a cum t-shirt.
[6843.70s -> 6844.40s]  This is fierce.
[6844.40s -> 6845.60s]  That's a little skewed.
[6848.60s -> 6850.10s]  I have to win one of the big ones.
[6850.10s -> 6851.20s]  I got to win a big one.
[6853.71s -> 6855.31s]  I actually got pool shark.
[6859.41s -> 6860.41s]  You get a free shirt though.
[6860.41s -> 6861.01s]  That's right.
[6864.43s -> 6865.43s]  Five gifted.
[6874.54s -> 6876.64s]  Why do you have such a hard time saying the word penis?
[6876.64s -> 6880.59s]  Please explain like that time.
[6880.59s -> 6881.49s]  You thought your zipper was down.
[6881.49s -> 6883.89s]  You almost said the word penis five times but stopped.
[6883.89s -> 6884.39s]  I don't know.
[6892.68s -> 6893.48s]  I said it there.
[6898.76s -> 6899.16s]  Hello.
[6900.32s -> 6901.12s]  How are you?
[6902.85s -> 6903.25s]  Good.
[6903.25s -> 6904.45s]  Just just pissed.
[6904.85s -> 6905.25s]  Yes.
[6905.25s -> 6905.65s]  Why?
[6906.85s -> 6907.35s]  Why?
[6908.76s -> 6909.66s]  Oh, you went to the bathroom.
[6909.66s -> 6910.16s]  You went pee.
[6910.46s -> 6912.46s]  I thought you meant that I'm just sitting here pissed like I took
[6912.46s -> 6913.26s]  too long or something.
[6913.56s -> 6914.16s]  No, no.
[6914.16s -> 6917.36s]  I had to go, you know, I had to go to the bathroom.
[6917.36s -> 6918.76s]  Do you pee sitting down by the way?
[6918.96s -> 6919.26s]  No.
[6920.19s -> 6921.39s]  Have you ever used a bidet?
[6922.25s -> 6924.15s]  No, I find them to be revolting.
[6924.95s -> 6925.45s]  What?
[6925.85s -> 6926.25s]  Yes.
[6927.15s -> 6928.15s]  Are you a bidet user?
[6930.20s -> 6933.70s]  This is going to fracture us in a way.
[6933.80s -> 6934.30s]  Are you sure?
[6934.90s -> 6935.80s]  I need to be enlightened.
[6935.80s -> 6936.30s]  Explain to me.
[6936.30s -> 6938.50s]  So let me let me tell you what I think when I think of a bidet.
[6939.60s -> 6942.14s]  So when you after you're done with the bathroom, if you go to
[6942.14s -> 6943.74s]  the bathroom, you finish just over.
[6944.66s -> 6946.66s]  Turning a water jet into your asshole.
[6947.20s -> 6950.20s]  Wouldn't you get shit and poop water all over your legs and
[6950.20s -> 6952.30s]  butt and stuff and have to make more work for yourself?
[6952.30s -> 6952.70s]  I don't understand.
[6952.70s -> 6953.30s]  Explain it to me.
[6953.30s -> 6953.80s]  I need it.
[6953.80s -> 6954.30s]  I need to know.
[6954.98s -> 6955.38s]  Right.
[6955.38s -> 6955.78s]  Okay.
[6955.78s -> 6956.08s]  All right.
[6956.08s -> 6959.58s]  That first of all, I'm not going to come at you.
[6959.58s -> 6962.58s]  You just seem to be a little bit ignorant on on all the
[6962.58s -> 6963.28s]  positives.
[6963.28s -> 6965.08s]  So I don't want to shame you.
[6965.81s -> 6971.15s]  Second of all, it's it's the greatest thing I've ever used
[6971.15s -> 6972.35s]  has changed my life.
[6972.35s -> 6973.75s]  I'm a bidet, not just a user.
[6973.75s -> 6975.95s]  I'm like a I'm like a salesman for bidets.
[6976.15s -> 6980.36s]  Okay, tell me so you can get you can get like a rinky-dink
[6980.36s -> 6980.96s]  one on Amazon.
[6980.96s -> 6981.96s]  It's like $30.
[6981.96s -> 6985.16s]  It blasts cold water at Mach 5 in your asshole.
[6985.16s -> 6986.56s]  And it's not comfortable.
[6987.55s -> 6989.85s]  I use a fancier bidet.
[6989.85s -> 6992.75s]  I use right now the Toto SW 2034.
[6993.61s -> 6994.01s]  Is that okay?
[6994.01s -> 6995.91s]  Is that like a AMD chip?
[6995.91s -> 6996.61s]  What was that?
[6997.21s -> 6999.91s]  This is about as expensive as a 3090.
[6999.91s -> 7001.01s]  All right, let's just put it that way.
[7001.01s -> 7001.51s]  Okay.
[7002.79s -> 7007.09s]  This has five different types of oscillating sprays 10
[7007.09s -> 7008.69s]  different pressure gauges.
[7009.40s -> 7014.74s]  All right, warm heated water also an air drying capability.
[7014.74s -> 7017.24s]  So you don't even need to use, you know, toilet paper if
[7017.24s -> 7021.64s]  you didn't want to comes with a deodorizer comes with white
[7021.64s -> 7022.34s]  noise maker.
[7022.34s -> 7023.94s]  So if you're if you're pooping and you don't want people
[7023.94s -> 7025.64s]  to know you're pooping they make it doesn't work.
[7025.64s -> 7027.64s]  That shit doesn't work about how loud your TV is.
[7027.84s -> 7032.48s]  Everyone's going to hear the like you've never you've never
[7032.48s -> 7036.19s]  used the Toto look it's it's just more hygienic.
[7036.49s -> 7040.79s]  You're you're cleaning a rug that has dirt on it with with
[7040.79s -> 7042.69s]  like, you know, sandpaper.
[7042.89s -> 7044.79s]  What kind of toilet paper are people using?
[7045.98s -> 7047.68s]  I'm just saying even you're using three-ply.
[7047.68s -> 7049.28s]  It's it's cleaning a rug with bounty.
[7049.58s -> 7051.18s]  That's not going to take it out of water.
[7051.18s -> 7052.38s]  What about the wet wipes, right?
[7052.38s -> 7056.48s]  What about like the wet wipes you they do not as they're
[7056.48s -> 7060.18s]  good, but they're not they're not as great for the environment
[7060.18s -> 7061.78s]  also need to keep re upping them.
[7063.27s -> 7065.17s]  You know that they're not always flushable.
[7065.37s -> 7067.57s]  Look, I understand it.
[7067.57s -> 7070.47s]  I will say it's it's a it's a concentrated spray.
[7070.47s -> 7071.57s]  It's not going to get on your legs.
[7071.57s -> 7072.67s]  That's absurd.
[7073.17s -> 7076.07s]  But isn't confined isn't your asshole wet?
[7076.17s -> 7078.87s]  How do you how do you go from like spraying your butt and
[7078.87s -> 7082.74s]  butthole with water to like now I'm putting my underwear
[7082.74s -> 7084.44s]  back on that always confused me.
[7084.88s -> 7088.28s]  So you use the bidet and then it's a it's a one wipe.
[7088.78s -> 7089.48s]  Here's my sales.
[7089.48s -> 7089.98s]  No way.
[7089.98s -> 7090.48s]  No way.
[7090.48s -> 7090.88s]  No way.
[7090.88s -> 7091.88s]  So I'm sorry.
[7091.88s -> 7093.48s]  I don't feel I that doesn't make me feel clean.
[7094.08s -> 7097.28s]  Let me tell you what if every poop for the rest of your
[7097.28s -> 7098.78s]  life was a one wiper.
[7099.61s -> 7100.21s]  It's impossible.
[7101.26s -> 7104.06s]  That's what a bidet does because I'm not normal though.
[7104.06s -> 7105.46s]  I have like colitis.
[7105.46s -> 7106.86s]  Like I don't think that would work for me.
[7107.16s -> 7108.16s]  It would be like messy.
[7108.76s -> 7110.86s]  No, it'll it will work for you.
[7110.86s -> 7111.76s]  Trust me.
[7112.06s -> 7112.66s]  Trust me.
[7112.66s -> 7113.76s]  Look, how about this?
[7113.76s -> 7114.36s]  How about this?
[7115.00s -> 7116.30s]  I'm going to get you bidet.
[7117.36s -> 7119.46s]  All right, you're going to buy me a bidet.
[7119.46s -> 7120.56s]  I'm going to buy you bidet.
[7120.56s -> 7120.96s]  I'll help.
[7120.96s -> 7122.16s]  I'll help you set it up.
[7122.36s -> 7123.83s]  You can try it.
[7124.03s -> 7127.14s]  If you don't like it, I'll take it out of your sight.
[7127.14s -> 7127.84s]  I'll burn it.
[7127.84s -> 7128.44s]  I'll destroy it.
[7128.44s -> 7130.24s]  We'll have you know, that scene in the office space where
[7130.24s -> 7131.54s]  they destroy the fax machine.
[7132.14s -> 7134.14s]  Yeah, we can do that with the bidet.
[7134.14s -> 7135.74s]  If you don't like it, it already did.
[7135.74s -> 7137.94s]  I already make this joke on my stream that like me having
[7137.94s -> 7140.44s]  a bidet, I would do the like laugh out loud Will Ferrell
[7140.44s -> 7142.24s]  skit where he like needs to take a drink out of water
[7142.24s -> 7144.88s]  and he like takes a drink out of the bidet fountain, right?
[7144.98s -> 7146.18s]  Like that's a Will Ferrell thing.
[7146.28s -> 7147.88s]  I already make that joke.
[7148.28s -> 7149.38s]  You haven't made that joke yet.
[7149.58s -> 7151.25s]  Okay, it's up for grabs.
[7151.35s -> 7152.05s]  I just made it.
[7154.00s -> 7155.24s]  Oh, sorry.
[7155.94s -> 7156.54s]  We can redo it.
[7158.54s -> 7158.74s]  All right.
[7158.74s -> 7159.54s]  Do you think that was funny?
[7160.34s -> 7161.14s]  Yeah, it was great.
[7161.14s -> 7162.94s]  Well, it's actually too close at home.
[7162.94s -> 7165.84s]  I've drank out of a bidet for $40 a couple years ago and
[7165.84s -> 7167.24s]  it was a big it was a big meme.
[7167.24s -> 7169.94s]  And then I did it again last month for $50.
[7171.24s -> 7173.54s]  Why are you drinking out of a bidet for $50?
[7174.34s -> 7176.34s]  Because 50 bucks is 50 bucks.
[7176.34s -> 7177.44s]  I mean you put that on a craft table.
[7177.44s -> 7178.54s]  You could walk out with a Rolex.
[7178.54s -> 7181.44s]  Why do I imagine you with like crooked sunglasses on like
[7181.44s -> 7182.34s]  eight drinks in?
[7183.93s -> 7186.83s]  Just like, yeah, man, I'll drink out of the bidet.
[7186.83s -> 7187.33s]  Fuck it.
[7187.33s -> 7188.63s]  You're gonna give me 60 bucks.
[7189.20s -> 7191.00s]  I'm just sitting in the bathroom and people are coming
[7191.00s -> 7191.20s]  in.
[7191.20s -> 7192.20s]  I'm just harassing them.
[7192.68s -> 7195.68s]  Oh, you think I won't you think I won't and they're like,
[7195.68s -> 7197.68s]  can we get can we get a little bit out of the bathroom?
[7197.68s -> 7198.88s]  He's just drinking out of the bidet.
[7198.88s -> 7199.48s]  He's annoying.
[7199.48s -> 7201.78s]  He said eight drinks get a load of this guy.
[7201.78s -> 7206.19s]  He thinks I won't like no, and I don't want you to I keep
[7206.19s -> 7209.59s]  lowering the amount of money that I'll do it for 40.
[7210.29s -> 7212.39s]  You think I won't pay you to drink out of this bidet right
[7212.39s -> 7212.59s]  now.
[7212.59s -> 7213.69s]  You think I won't do that.
[7214.39s -> 7215.89s]  You just don't you put your hands on it.
[7215.89s -> 7217.89s]  You do a headstand and like keg stand the bidet.
[7218.79s -> 7219.99s]  I'm way too adept at it.
[7219.99s -> 7221.49s]  I'm too skilled at drinking out of it.
[7221.49s -> 7222.59s]  People are weirded out.
[7224.16s -> 7226.34s]  Yeah, that's that's that's me.
[7226.54s -> 7227.74s]  No, they're amazing.
[7227.74s -> 7229.24s]  I'm gonna I'm going to do that.
[7229.24s -> 7231.54s]  I've done this before for a different friend of mine.
[7231.54s -> 7233.74s]  You've purchased bidets for multiple people.
[7234.58s -> 7236.58s]  Eventually, I'm not lying to you.
[7236.58s -> 7237.28s]  Eventually.
[7237.28s -> 7241.08s]  My goal is to create my own bidets and sell them.
[7241.28s -> 7243.78s]  Jesus, did you really want me to play World of Warcraft?
[7246.88s -> 7248.98s]  That's like the I need to get my friend to play World of
[7248.98s -> 7249.28s]  Warcraft.
[7249.28s -> 7250.48s]  Hey, I'll buy for the first month, man.

[7251.98s -> 7252.58s]  You need items.
[7252.78s -> 7254.18s]  Oh, let me tell you the lore of this place.
[7254.72s -> 7257.72s]  This gets me no there's no this is a selfless endeavor.
[7257.72s -> 7259.82s]  Oh well until I sell them then that's a selfish endeavor.
[7259.82s -> 7262.32s]  But for now, it's a selfless endeavor because I just think
[7262.32s -> 7264.12s]  it's such a great product.
[7264.12s -> 7265.82s]  You know, it's World of Warcraft because I'm trying to play
[7265.82s -> 7266.72s]  with you this.
[7266.72s -> 7269.02s]  I don't know what happens when you shit germ.
[7269.02s -> 7271.02s]  I've never I've never thought about it till today.
[7272.33s -> 7275.03s]  You just want me to have a much better experience.
[7275.53s -> 7279.33s]  Yeah, I want you to feel about shitting how I do which is
[7279.33s -> 7282.03s]  it's like a it's like a good experience pleasurable not well,
[7282.03s -> 7284.03s]  that's not it's not pleasure, but it's a good experience.
[7284.03s -> 7286.90s]  It's like a it's a good experience.
[7286.90s -> 7288.20s]  It feels good experience.
[7288.20s -> 7290.10s]  It's a positive experience is what I was looking for.
[7290.56s -> 7295.45s]  Okay, is it before we move on one final question does the
[7295.45s -> 7302.63s]  water hit you in the bag of you know what I'm saying?
[7306.50s -> 7310.20s]  I imagine I imagine like really cold water hitting me right
[7310.20s -> 7314.30s]  in the balls and it's like, oh, okay.
[7314.30s -> 7314.70s]  All right.
[7314.70s -> 7319.82s]  Well, look there there is much like a car seat when you get
[7319.82s -> 7322.52s]  in for the first time maybe you're a little too far up and
[7322.52s -> 7323.42s]  you need to crank it back.
[7323.42s -> 7326.42s]  But after you've done it, you should be fine unless you sit
[7326.72s -> 7330.12s]  in obtuse ways every time you get on the toilet, I said like
[7330.12s -> 7331.02s]  you get your mode.
[7331.32s -> 7331.72s]  You're good.
[7331.72s -> 7333.32s]  I said this is how I sit on the toilet.
[7333.32s -> 7335.76s]  You should have like a phone is usually like this.
[7338.38s -> 7338.98s]  I'm watching.
[7339.97s -> 7340.87s]  Yeah, that's that's fine.
[7340.87s -> 7342.07s]  That seems standard.
[7342.17s -> 7343.17s]  It seems like a standard.
[7344.12s -> 7346.72s]  Okay, that's oddly 45 degree.
[7346.72s -> 7347.42s]  It's still fine.
[7347.42s -> 7349.89s]  It's just you know, yeah, it's fine.
[7349.89s -> 7350.79s]  That's that's fine.
[7350.79s -> 7352.59s]  Do you have long balls or something?
[7352.79s -> 7357.09s]  Yes, I was okay.
[7357.39s -> 7357.89s]  Sorry.
[7361.24s -> 7362.24s]  Look, I'll tell you this.
[7362.24s -> 7364.64s]  It's it's not cold water as well as heated water.
[7364.64s -> 7366.24s]  Yeah, but you saw this different kinds.
[7366.24s -> 7368.44s]  Are you going to buy me like the all right?
[7368.44s -> 7371.34s]  Are you going to get me the Cadillac or are you going to
[7371.34s -> 7373.94s]  get me like the the used car?
[7373.94s -> 7375.94s]  I like I'm getting you the Ferrari.
[7377.53s -> 7379.03s]  Okay, walk into your bathroom.
[7379.03s -> 7381.63s]  You're going to think you walked into a SpaceX ship.
[7381.63s -> 7382.93s]  It's going to make noises.
[7383.86s -> 7385.66s]  It's gonna have like blue light emanating from it.
[7385.66s -> 7386.56s]  It's going to be amazing.

[7396.09s -> 7398.19s]  I come out of the bathroom like let me tell you about it.
[7398.19s -> 7400.19s]  Like is that what you want to like tell you exactly like
[7400.19s -> 7401.09s]  right after I use it.
[7401.56s -> 7404.46s]  I don't need to be gratified immediately.
[7404.56s -> 7408.94s]  I think I'm so confident in a bidet as a as a as a thing
[7408.94s -> 7412.94s]  as a product as an invention that I know long-term.
[7412.94s -> 7413.54s]  You'll love it.

[7441.36s -> 7442.46s]  in a backpack and put it?
[7442.46s -> 7443.36s]  I had to check that.
[7443.56s -> 7446.36s]  Yeah, I had to check that they were had to hide the whole
[7446.36s -> 7447.06s]  conversation.
[7447.06s -> 7449.86s]  They waited they put it in put the little ticker on it.
[7450.06s -> 7453.06s]  Why am I imagining you setting the bidet up in the airplane
[7453.06s -> 7455.93s]  bathroom because you like it and you want one in there.
[7457.16s -> 7459.26s]  Yeah, I just have like an extra everywhere.

[7467.33s -> 7467.93s]  Will Ferrell?
[7469.30s -> 7469.80s]  Well, you did well.

[7471.40s -> 7473.50s]  That's what will Smith will Smith.
[7473.50s -> 7473.80s]  Oh shit.
[7473.80s -> 7476.00s]  I thought you guys tell me Will Ferrell put a bidet in an
[7476.00s -> 7477.40s]  airplane bathroom and had a drink.
[7477.88s -> 7478.38s]  No, no, no.
[7478.38s -> 7480.48s]  I'm talking about Pursuit of Happiness with Will Smith,
[7480.78s -> 7484.32s]  you know where he buys all these medical equipment and
[7484.32s -> 7486.22s]  he has to he has to like sell them.
[7486.42s -> 7489.06s]  You know that movie I think I've heard of it.
[7489.98s -> 7492.88s]  Basically he goes into debt because he buys all these
[7492.88s -> 7495.38s]  medical equipment and he has to go door to door to every
[7495.38s -> 7496.48s]  hospital to sell them.
[7496.68s -> 7497.78s]  That's me with bidets.
[7497.78s -> 7501.58s]  Like I put my net worth into this product and now I'm just
[7501.58s -> 7504.86s]  desperately trying to sell them just going door to door
[7504.86s -> 7505.86s]  trying to get people.
[7506.56s -> 7508.06s]  People got to buy these bidets.
[7508.46s -> 7508.86s]  Yeah.
[7508.86s -> 7510.96s]  It's got so many of them bidets.
[7511.50s -> 7513.90s]  Yeah, just it's it's like floor to ceiling.
[7514.20s -> 7515.30s]  My girlfriend's pissed.
[7515.30s -> 7517.30s]  She can barely walk into the bedroom because there's so
[7517.30s -> 7518.10s]  many bidets.
[7518.64s -> 7521.04s]  Hey, I just have a long-term strategy long-term strategy.
[7521.04s -> 7523.52s]  You'll make 10% on each one.
[7523.96s -> 7525.76s]  We're going to make 10x if you just wait.
[7525.76s -> 7526.16s]  All right.
[7526.16s -> 7526.56s]  Yeah.
[7526.56s -> 7526.96s]  For now.
[7526.96s -> 7530.16s]  We have bidets everywhere around the house, but soon we'll
[7530.16s -> 7534.76s]  just have millions in an entire country adapted to the world
[7534.76s -> 7535.36s]  of bidets.
[7535.66s -> 7539.40s]  Put them on every sink instead of a brita.
[7539.40s -> 7543.36s]  It's just a bidet that you can drink from that's fucking
[7543.36s -> 7544.96s]  gross, but it's not even it's just like a piece of metal
[7544.96s -> 7546.46s]  that shoots water like you can shoot in your mouth.
[7546.46s -> 7547.36s]  It's not gross at all.
[7547.66s -> 7548.06s]  Whatever.
[7548.50s -> 7552.20s]  It's 0% gross because it doesn't you know, I mean the first
[7552.20s -> 7554.60s]  you can drinking out of a bidet on the first spray.
[7554.60s -> 7555.80s]  That's that's anything.
[7555.80s -> 7559.88s]  It's more hygienic, you know, 50 sprays in we got some problems.
[7559.88s -> 7560.48s]  I'm telling you.
[7560.48s -> 7561.58s]  I'm telling you after day one.
[7561.58s -> 7563.58s]  I ain't not drinking out of a bidet.
[7564.08s -> 7564.98s]  Not doing that.
[7564.98s -> 7565.48s]  That's fair.
[7565.48s -> 7568.38s]  But day zero you'd be like, yeah, it's just you know, okay.
[7568.38s -> 7570.78s]  I don't want to stay on bidet for a million years, but I
[7570.78s -> 7571.68s]  have another question.
[7572.08s -> 7572.68s]  Yeah, please.
[7572.68s -> 7573.48s]  Oh fuck.
[7573.48s -> 7573.88s]  All right.
[7576.18s -> 7577.88s]  Where is the nozzle?
[7577.88s -> 7579.38s]  Do you like shit on the nozzle?
[7579.38s -> 7580.18s]  Like where is it not?
[7580.18s -> 7580.68s]  Where's the point?
[7580.68s -> 7583.78s]  How is it pointed angle to not get like pissed and pooped on?
[7584.28s -> 7587.73s]  There are two nozzles and they retract.
[7587.83s -> 7590.13s]  I mean they were like like landing gear in a plane.
[7590.43s -> 7592.43s]  Yeah, exactly like a landing gear in a plane.
[7592.43s -> 7594.43s]  You can literally see it retract.
[7595.60s -> 7600.80s]  What yeah, it goes into itself and then to clean itself.
[7601.00s -> 7603.80s]  It will spray where it retracts to think of it as like an
[7603.80s -> 7607.90s]  enclosure and it'll just ricochet off of like its enclosure
[7607.90s -> 7608.90s]  to clean itself.
[7611.04s -> 7615.26s]  What this is I'm telling you the technology exists.
[7615.26s -> 7616.66s]  You just don't know about it yet.
[7618.66s -> 7619.66s]  I don't know man.
[7619.66s -> 7621.66s]  This is I know this is freaking me out, but I'll try it.

[7623.98s -> 7624.88s]  It'll be great.
[7625.59s -> 7626.59s]  I'm looking forward to it.
[7626.69s -> 7627.29s]  Let's do it.

[7648.49s -> 7648.89s]  All right.
[7650.97s -> 7654.92s]  How about okay, whoever the how are you?
[7654.92s -> 7655.62s]  How are you feeling by the way?
[7655.62s -> 7656.02s]  You good?
[7656.02s -> 7657.82s]  You are you still having fun with Battleship?
[7658.22s -> 7659.02s]  I'm feeling phenomenal.
[7659.02s -> 7660.52s]  I'm happy to switch gears at any time.
[7660.52s -> 7661.92s]  I'm so easy.
[7661.92s -> 7662.42s]  I'm easy.
[7662.72s -> 7665.82s]  Okay, there apparently is like an advanced super mode.
[7666.48s -> 7667.98s]  We're playing want to try that right now.
[7668.28s -> 7669.48s]  You want to try the advanced mode?
[7669.88s -> 7671.08s]  I'm happy to try the advanced mode.
[7671.08s -> 7671.78s]  I did see that.
[7671.78s -> 7672.38s]  I didn't know what it meant.
[7672.38s -> 7674.08s]  I don't know things.
[7674.08s -> 7674.88s]  I'm scared of them.
[7674.88s -> 7675.88s]  How about we speed run this one?
[7675.88s -> 7677.18s]  Let's do one speed run round.
[7677.88s -> 7680.18s]  Well, you cannot you cannot take more than two seconds to
[7680.18s -> 7680.98s]  click on a space.
[7681.72s -> 7682.12s]  All right.
[7682.12s -> 7682.52s]  All right.
[7682.52s -> 7686.80s]  How about how about also every ship has to connect in some
[7686.80s -> 7687.20s]  manner?
[7687.30s -> 7687.60s]  Sure.
[7688.66s -> 7688.86s]  All right.
[7688.86s -> 7690.96s]  Every ship has to connect and you have to take you can
[7690.96s -> 7692.56s]  now take more than two seconds to click.
[7693.26s -> 7694.36s]  Corner connecting is fine.
[7694.56s -> 7705.00s]  Okay, that should be good.
[7710.34s -> 7710.74s]  Shit.
[7710.74s -> 7711.04s]  I don't know.
[7711.04s -> 7712.84s]  This is like way more complicated than I thought it was.
[7713.34s -> 7717.58s]  Yeah, I find myself struggling a bit here.
[7718.58s -> 7720.08s]  It's actually a pretty good lineup.
[7723.32s -> 7724.62s]  No, I'm not going to do F again.
[7725.02s -> 7725.72s]  Why would I do that?
[7727.39s -> 7729.79s]  I think this is I think I think you might be mind-tricking
[7729.79s -> 7730.19s]  me here.
[7731.99s -> 7733.39s]  No, I was I was just doing it.
[7733.39s -> 7734.89s]  I was just moving ships around to make it enough.
[7735.19s -> 7740.16s]  What a terrible design.
[7743.12s -> 7745.02s]  But the design was so much better than this.
[7750.22s -> 7751.72s]  Why does it look so fucking wrong?
[7756.27s -> 7762.43s]  Is this supposed to look wrong?
[7762.43s -> 7763.83s]  It's just it's not bad.
[7763.83s -> 7765.03s]  How does it can't look wrong?
[7765.03s -> 7767.43s]  You can't do battleship wrong.
[7767.53s -> 7769.53s]  No, but I'm trying to be I'm connecting them wrong.
[7772.65s -> 7773.55s]  Adam already.
[7774.84s -> 7782.82s]  Oh, two seconds.
[7783.52s -> 7784.02s]  Oh shit.
[7784.02s -> 7784.42s]  Shit.
[7785.84s -> 7786.64s]  Oh my God.
[7793.49s -> 7794.89s]  What how are you not going down?
[7796.20s -> 7797.30s]  Oh, we didn't even bet anything.
[7797.30s -> 7798.10s]  We didn't bet anything.
[7798.50s -> 7800.40s]  Oh, yeah, we just said speed around so we could get to
[7800.40s -> 7800.90s]  the other thing.
[7800.90s -> 7801.40s]  That's right.
[7801.90s -> 7809.37s]  Let's just do a very casual very breezy one gifted sub.
[7809.67s -> 7815.36s]  Okay left.
[7815.36s -> 7816.66s]  Oh song.
[7817.24s -> 7817.44s]  All right.
[7817.44s -> 7822.79s]  So it has to connect in some way which that makes this game
[7822.79s -> 7823.39s]  somewhat easy.
[7823.39s -> 7824.89s]  Corners can connect to right?
[7825.29s -> 7825.59s]  Yeah.
[7825.59s -> 7833.98s]  Corners connects is nothing on the line.
[7833.98s -> 7835.58s]  You're going to win this miss clicked.
[7835.68s -> 7836.78s]  I literally miss clicked.
[7838.29s -> 7839.79s]  I don't actually think I win this one.
[7839.79s -> 7840.39s]  I think you do.
[7842.86s -> 7844.26s]  Give me that's all about sub.
[7845.99s -> 7846.99s]  How it's connected.
[7848.39s -> 7851.39s]  I actually would feel bad for you if you won this because
[7851.39s -> 7854.89s]  you just be winning all the low stakes matches for $80.
[7856.11s -> 7857.61s]  At least I got to participate.
[7857.71s -> 7858.21s]  It was fun.
[7858.21s -> 7858.61s]  Yeah.
[7860.79s -> 7862.39s]  Oh, you went corner.
[7862.69s -> 7862.99s]  You did.
[7862.99s -> 7863.99s]  I did go corner.
[7864.09s -> 7866.48s]  Well, I want a bit corner.
[7868.30s -> 7869.50s]  You went adjacent.
[7869.60s -> 7870.10s]  You did.
[7876.32s -> 7878.46s]  Oh, no, this is your destroyer.
[7880.77s -> 7881.17s]  Okay.
[7881.27s -> 7881.67s]  All right.
[7883.00s -> 7884.40s]  How would you have connected this?
[7884.40s -> 7885.20s]  I think a corner.
[7886.17s -> 7886.77s]  There we are.
[7891.10s -> 7893.70s]  Oh, you just made it like the letter I.
[7895.36s -> 7899.49s]  Hey, I think you might have made a perfect letter.
[7899.49s -> 7902.74s]  I what did you do though?
[7904.28s -> 7906.78s]  I went for a more refined strategy.
[7906.88s -> 7908.68s]  This is this seems pretty refined.
[7909.80s -> 7913.10s]  I wasn't thinking the letter L or anything.
[7913.10s -> 7913.40s]  Oh shit.
[7913.40s -> 7914.00s]  You didn't do that.
[7914.00s -> 7923.36s]  Okay, so must be here for now.
[7923.36s -> 7924.96s]  The question is you have a what?
[7925.46s -> 7926.36s]  Oh, no.
[7928.70s -> 7930.10s]  Oh, no.
[7931.17s -> 7932.07s]  Wait, okay.
[7932.47s -> 7934.27s]  Is it continued down here?
[7935.26s -> 7936.26s]  It is it's a letter.
[7936.26s -> 7937.16s]  I it's the letter.
[7937.16s -> 7939.56s]  I you just made the letter letter J.
[7939.56s -> 7940.46s]  I just did it wrong.
[7940.96s -> 7943.36s]  Wait, you didn't do the letter J.
[7943.36s -> 7945.16s]  If you that's supposed to be the letter J.
[7945.80s -> 7946.30s]  Right.
[7946.40s -> 7947.40s]  All right for Jerma.
[7947.50s -> 7947.90s]  Mm-hmm.
[7949.08s -> 7953.38s]  Now we're going to refine that is I went for at first.
[7953.38s -> 7956.38s]  I just did a really like a cross and I was like, no, I've done this.
[7957.44s -> 7957.64s]  All right.
[7957.64s -> 7959.34s]  Well, it was it was low stakes.
[7959.34s -> 7960.74s]  It was it was just a gifted.
[7960.74s -> 7961.34s]  So that's fine.
[7961.34s -> 7962.24s]  It's just a gifted.
[7962.24s -> 7962.74s]  It's all right.
[7962.74s -> 7966.71s]  And on top of the hundred hundred and one gifted subs actually 96.
[7966.71s -> 7968.31s]  I owe you five from our side bet.
[7968.31s -> 7969.11s]  Oh, that's right.
[7970.30s -> 7972.00s]  Okay, I'm going to create one.
[7972.00s -> 7973.40s]  It says commanders.
[7973.70s -> 7974.50s]  Whoa.
[7974.50s -> 7976.66s]  Yeah, this is I can hold this another game mode.
[7976.86s -> 7978.96s]  He there's like different maps.
[7980.91s -> 7981.91s]  Let's do one of the wacky ones.
[7982.38s -> 7985.18s]  Yeah, we're going to play at.
[7985.48s -> 7990.69s]  Oh, I can I can purchase this we can play at going to buy it.
[7991.32s -> 7994.42s]  Yeah, I'm going to buy I can buy the White Cliffs of Dover or the
[7994.42s -> 7997.95s]  Colossus Bay Colossus Bay.
[7998.42s -> 8005.51s]  Yeah, that's I think sounds somebody keeps saying don't bet on Jerma.
[8005.51s -> 8006.11s]  He sucks.
[8007.36s -> 8010.26s]  Well, I mean, look, you sometimes get into a streak and I was on
[8010.26s -> 8012.46s]  a winning streak in the beginning and now he's on a winning streak.
[8013.12s -> 8016.72s]  You were hot for a minute, but it can come back.
[8018.69s -> 8019.19s]  Okay.
[8019.49s -> 8019.69s]  All right.
[8019.69s -> 8021.69s]  You got a code sending you the code.
[8022.29s -> 8023.79s]  So I opened up our discord.
[8023.79s -> 8024.49s]  This is your ass.
[8025.39s -> 8025.89s]  Yeah.
[8026.09s -> 8026.29s]  Yeah.
[8026.29s -> 8027.39s]  Might be we didn't clear that.
[8027.39s -> 8029.29s]  It's just it's just written on your ass.
[8030.71s -> 8031.91s]  So here's the thing.
[8032.70s -> 8036.70s]  The boats are not all shaped like boats in this one.
[8036.90s -> 8039.08s]  Wait, what are you seeing this?
[8039.08s -> 8039.68s]  Yeah, this is weird.
[8040.18s -> 8041.18s]  I think you can show now.
[8042.77s -> 8046.73s]  But yeah, they're not all like well, this is weird.
[8046.73s -> 8047.53s]  This is different.
[8047.53s -> 8049.13s]  This is like a different arena too.
[8049.64s -> 8052.04s]  Do you think there are advantages for different commanders?
[8052.04s -> 8057.48s]  Should we do a Clone War here or torpedo airstrike bombardment
[8057.88s -> 8060.38s]  projectiles surgical strike?
[8061.24s -> 8062.44s]  So what does this mean?
[8062.81s -> 8063.91s]  I don't know what salvo means.
[8063.91s -> 8065.11s]  I've never even heard of that.
[8065.41s -> 8069.31s]  Salvo is like a four or five like six like kind of spread out
[8069.31s -> 8071.05s]  shooting a missile, huh?
[8072.64s -> 8073.74s]  I'm going to try this.
[8073.74s -> 8075.91s]  I think we have nearly the same shifts.
[8075.91s -> 8077.31s]  We'll have to remember the shapes here.
[8077.51s -> 8078.71s]  Yours seems really bad though.
[8078.71s -> 8079.41s]  I'm not going to lie.
[8079.41s -> 8080.21s]  Are you happy with that?
[8080.21s -> 8081.71s]  He's oh, maybe not.
[8082.11s -> 8082.91s]  Look at the far right.
[8082.91s -> 8089.06s]  It's just a giant for yeah, this is I'm happier with this guy,
[8089.06s -> 8090.66s]  but he's got but maybe he has a better I'm going to go with
[8090.66s -> 8091.76s]  this guy because he got torpedo.
[8092.30s -> 8092.60s]  All right.
[8092.60s -> 8092.90s]  All right.
[8092.90s -> 8094.40s]  I'm going to go with Sir Philip Wade.
[8094.40s -> 8096.40s]  He's doing well pay to win.
[8097.00s -> 8098.10s]  This is pay to win now.
[8099.30s -> 8099.50s]  Shit.
[8099.50s -> 8107.31s]  Do I have to buy these abilities mine sonar bomb torpedo?
[8110.13s -> 8113.53s]  What I'm seeing is that it's almost like set up to make me
[8113.53s -> 8118.36s]  put these really beautifully in the corners to get that urge.
[8118.36s -> 8120.16s]  I do have this urge to kind of Tetris this.
[8120.64s -> 8131.78s]  Yeah, and it's the worst idea possible.
[8131.98s -> 8132.78s]  I'm happy with that.
[8134.24s -> 8140.73s]  I almost think it's what if I do something like this would
[8140.73s -> 8141.73s]  be a little silly, huh?
[8146.17s -> 8146.87s]  I'm happy with this.
[8147.55s -> 8151.35s]  I feel good about where I'm at.
[8153.78s -> 8156.18s]  So when do we what decides if we get to use our abilities?
[8156.58s -> 8160.18s]  I have no idea how any of it works, but I guess we'll see
[8160.28s -> 8161.18s]  I'm starting us off.
[8161.18s -> 8161.78s]  Well, what's our bet?
[8161.78s -> 8162.38s]  What's our wager?
[8163.08s -> 8163.68s]  Another tweet.
[8164.44s -> 8164.74s]  Okay.
[8164.74s -> 8166.04s]  Oh, whoa.
[8166.83s -> 8168.73s]  Is this a double or nothing in the sense that your your
[8168.73s -> 8172.47s]  other tweets like gone or how do you know just just just
[8172.47s -> 8173.27s]  for another one?
[8173.57s -> 8174.37s]  Just a second tweet.
[8174.37s -> 8174.67s]  Okay.
[8174.77s -> 8175.07s]  All right.
[8175.07s -> 8176.27s]  Interesting interesting.
[8177.50s -> 8178.80s]  This is this is weird.
[8179.47s -> 8179.77s]  All right.
[8179.77s -> 8181.77s]  I have a single shot.
[8181.77s -> 8183.27s]  I got two lightning bolts.
[8184.39s -> 8185.49s]  You got two lightning bolts.
[8186.63s -> 8187.43s]  What is going on?
[8187.83s -> 8188.13s]  I don't know.
[8188.13s -> 8190.01s]  There's like a there's like abilities.
[8190.01s -> 8191.31s]  I don't know what's going on here.
[8192.04s -> 8197.08s]  It gave me two lightning when I what did I do just
[8197.08s -> 8197.88s]  dropped a mine.
[8198.94s -> 8199.84s]  What does that do?
[8199.84s -> 8200.34s]  I don't know.
[8201.39s -> 8203.19s]  Maybe if I click on it, it hurts me.
[8203.66s -> 8204.76s]  Do you know where my mind is?
[8205.24s -> 8206.04s]  No, I have no idea.
[8207.03s -> 8207.43s]  Okay.
[8207.53s -> 8208.13s]  I was going to shoot it.
[8208.13s -> 8209.33s]  That would have been a giveaway.
[8211.53s -> 8212.43s]  I thought that was a mine.
[8212.43s -> 8212.83s]  Okay.
[8213.47s -> 8213.87s]  No, no, no.
[8213.87s -> 8215.67s]  I put my mind somewhere.
[8216.07s -> 8218.87s]  I guess you get like ability points per turn.
[8218.87s -> 8219.67s]  Oh, all right.
[8220.34s -> 8220.84s]  I get it.
[8224.77s -> 8225.87s]  Oh, it shows you the pieces.
[8228.56s -> 8229.16s]  Oh, I get it.
[8229.16s -> 8229.36s]  Okay.
[8229.36s -> 8229.56s]  Yeah.
[8229.56s -> 8229.86s]  Yeah.
[8231.42s -> 8236.05s]  And I play some mine, but I can also just not do anything
[8236.05s -> 8237.25s]  and I think I save.
[8237.25s -> 8239.88s]  Oh, did you tuck it in?
[8240.08s -> 8241.68s]  Wait, that gave me a lightning bolt.
[8241.68s -> 8245.09s]  By the way, if you can still afford some abilities, you
[8245.09s -> 8246.39s]  can choose to save him.
[8246.69s -> 8248.19s]  I'm going to save my mind.
[8248.87s -> 8251.07s]  Wait, I should mine where my ship is, right?
[8253.56s -> 8254.46s]  Presumably.
[8258.90s -> 8259.50s]  You know what?
[8260.00s -> 8261.90s]  Oh, whoa.
[8262.20s -> 8266.00s]  What you bombs away and I didn't do anything.
[8266.00s -> 8267.70s]  This you don't have anything in the side.
[8267.90s -> 8268.80s]  It was a whiff.
[8269.10s -> 8270.50s]  No, not to say I have nothing over there.
[8270.50s -> 8272.70s]  You should you should keep your forces.
[8272.90s -> 8274.00s]  Keep your forces on the left.
[8274.00s -> 8275.40s]  You just missed you're close.
[8279.84s -> 8280.44s]  All right.
[8280.44s -> 8282.04s]  I reverse psychology you.
[8282.04s -> 8282.44s]  All right.
[8282.44s -> 8282.84s]  All right.
[8282.84s -> 8283.44s]  So where is it?
[8283.44s -> 8285.44s]  Where is this fucking scumbag?
[8288.10s -> 8288.60s]  Okay.
[8292.14s -> 8293.64s]  So I have so many points.
[8293.64s -> 8294.44s]  What does this do?
[8294.98s -> 8296.38s]  Oh, you used five point.
[8296.38s -> 8300.86s]  I'm going to save up for my my maximum surely you went to
[8300.86s -> 8301.46s]  the right here.
[8301.46s -> 8304.90s]  Like you do know damn it.
[8307.17s -> 8307.37s]  All right.
[8307.37s -> 8310.37s]  So I have to be careful because now you have like a super bomb
[8310.37s -> 8310.87s]  now, don't you?
[8310.87s -> 8312.47s]  Whatever your like ultimate ability is.
[8312.67s -> 8314.07s]  Yeah, I don't know what it is.
[8314.07s -> 8316.37s]  It's my salvo or whatever.
[8316.85s -> 8318.45s]  What are you feeding me right now?
[8319.88s -> 8320.68s]  I have a few.
[8320.68s -> 8320.98s]  Okay.
[8320.98s -> 8323.00s]  You have this still.
[8323.20s -> 8323.80s]  Oh my God.
[8323.80s -> 8324.40s]  How did you know?
[8324.40s -> 8325.30s]  I just figured it would be.
[8325.30s -> 8326.40s]  Oh wait, that's not even that one.
[8326.50s -> 8327.00s]  Which one is this?
[8327.00s -> 8327.70s]  No, it's not.
[8327.70s -> 8328.60s]  It's it's the other one.
[8329.46s -> 8329.76s]  What?
[8330.26s -> 8331.06s]  Oh, all right.
[8331.06s -> 8331.46s]  All right.
[8331.46s -> 8331.86s]  All right.
[8332.59s -> 8332.79s]  All right.
[8332.79s -> 8333.89s]  That's that's big for me.
[8335.93s -> 8336.43s]  Okay.
[8336.43s -> 8339.43s]  So you're you're just presumably wait, what does this do?
[8342.85s -> 8343.85s]  Does it just shoot?
[8345.16s -> 8345.56s]  Hold up.
[8345.56s -> 8345.96s]  Hold up.
[8345.96s -> 8346.86s]  Let me let me do this.
[8350.60s -> 8353.83s]  Oh, nothing you have goes.
[8353.83s -> 8355.03s]  This should probably be down here.
[8355.03s -> 8355.33s]  No.
[8357.98s -> 8359.58s]  Oh, what is this?
[8359.58s -> 8360.58s]  Is it a square one?
[8362.09s -> 8362.89s]  Oh, it is.
[8363.67s -> 8364.77s]  So where does this go?
[8364.77s -> 8365.47s]  Maybe here.
[8366.91s -> 8368.51s]  It's actually a lot harder because there could be so many
[8368.51s -> 8369.81s]  places where the tails can be.
[8370.67s -> 8370.87s]  All right.
[8370.87s -> 8371.97s]  Let's let's try this.
[8373.12s -> 8382.21s]  Oh, oh wait, somebody said use your cue.
[8385.20s -> 8386.20s]  I'm actually kind of scared.
[8386.20s -> 8388.40s]  Are you going to draw like a nuke on here?
[8391.80s -> 8393.60s]  Oh, what the fuck you actually got it.
[8394.00s -> 8394.30s]  Yeah.
[8394.30s -> 8396.40s]  Well, because it can only it could have only been there,
[8396.40s -> 8396.70s]  right?
[8396.70s -> 8398.90s]  Because if you flip it, it'll be the other direction and I
[8398.90s -> 8400.30s]  can also do this.
[8404.71s -> 8405.71s]  Oh my God.
[8406.31s -> 8406.91s]  What is that?
[8406.91s -> 8407.41s]  What did you do?
[8407.41s -> 8408.01s]  What does that do?
[8408.01s -> 8411.41s]  I just I sonar checked and I think there are two there's
[8411.41s -> 8412.81s]  two ships in that area.
[8416.81s -> 8419.91s]  Zero color zero zero torpedo fired across a row or a
[8419.91s -> 8420.31s]  column.
[8420.31s -> 8421.71s]  It stops when it hits a ship.
[8422.63s -> 8424.56s]  What what?
[8428.01s -> 8428.71s]  Oh shit.
[8428.71s -> 8429.61s]  That's awesome.
[8429.91s -> 8433.51s]  What is that's the best ability I've ever seen.
[8436.66s -> 8437.96s]  I wish I would I do with this.
[8439.08s -> 8440.98s]  Well, now, you know that there's a ship there.
[8440.98s -> 8442.28s]  No, I just put a mine down.
[8443.33s -> 8444.23s]  Oh, you put a mine down.
[8444.23s -> 8445.23s]  I put a mine down as well.
[8445.23s -> 8446.03s]  I don't know what happens.
[8446.03s -> 8448.23s]  I assume on when you hit it, it just ends your turn.
[8449.09s -> 8449.29s]  All right.
[8449.29s -> 8453.21s]  So there's two ships.
[8453.21s -> 8455.11s]  This is kind of cool area.
[8455.51s -> 8456.21s]  This is amazing.
[8456.21s -> 8458.87s]  Yeah, I think it has to be here.
[8460.05s -> 8461.55s]  Yeah, and then probably down.
[8461.55s -> 8463.62s]  No, no to the to the right.
[8463.62s -> 8465.12s]  It must have been you.
[8465.12s -> 8466.12s]  I know you got points.
[8467.04s -> 8469.24s]  Let me do one of I think I might.
[8474.46s -> 8476.76s]  Oh, you can't do that.
[8476.76s -> 8477.06s]  Okay.
[8477.06s -> 8478.16s]  I thought you okay.
[8480.88s -> 8482.48s]  What if I put something?
[8487.12s -> 8487.52s]  Okay.
[8488.62s -> 8489.22s]  You know what?
[8489.22s -> 8490.82s]  I was talking a lot of shit.
[8492.02s -> 8494.02s]  Jerma this this could be meta.
[8495.32s -> 8496.12s]  You think it is.
[8496.42s -> 8497.12s]  Oh nice.
[8497.12s -> 8497.92s]  It's your little one.
[8498.30s -> 8500.50s]  There's going to be like a character tier list.
[8504.48s -> 8505.78s]  You have two small ones.
[8505.78s -> 8507.28s]  You have two twos or what?
[8507.38s -> 8508.18s]  I have two twos.
[8508.18s -> 8509.98s]  Yeah, I don't know if that's like because I paid for this
[8509.98s -> 8511.38s]  character and I'm paying to win.
[8511.38s -> 8512.38s]  Oh fuck.
[8513.14s -> 8513.54s]  All right.
[8513.64s -> 8513.94s]  All right.
[8513.94s -> 8515.84s]  You must have some points built up.
[8515.84s -> 8516.14s]  No.
[8516.14s -> 8517.14s]  Oh, I got four.
[8518.88s -> 8520.48s]  Presumably it's here.
[8521.40s -> 8521.70s]  Yeah.
[8521.70s -> 8522.20s]  All right.
[8522.20s -> 8522.50s]  Yeah.
[8522.50s -> 8522.90s]  Yeah.
[8522.90s -> 8523.10s]  Yeah.
[8523.10s -> 8524.10s]  I suck your little guy.
[8524.10s -> 8525.20s]  That's a little guy.
[8525.20s -> 8525.90s]  That's big.
[8527.48s -> 8528.88s]  You also have another little guy.
[8530.04s -> 8530.44s]  Oh, I do.
[8530.44s -> 8530.74s]  You're right.
[8530.74s -> 8531.04s]  Yeah.
[8531.04s -> 8531.64s]  This is fair.
[8532.14s -> 8534.84s]  Let's let's let's scan this is a big area.
[8537.81s -> 8539.41s]  Oh, someone's in here.
[8539.81s -> 8542.01s]  But on the just on the outskirts of it.
[8542.01s -> 8550.22s]  So probably here and there's a comeback mechanic because
[8550.22s -> 8556.28s]  every time you get shot you just get a point and go.
[8557.11s -> 8557.81s]  Oh no.
[8558.57s -> 8558.77s]  All right.
[8558.77s -> 8559.57s]  What do you got twos?
[8560.94s -> 8563.54s]  I have a I've got quite a few.
[8563.84s -> 8564.04s]  All right.
[8564.04s -> 8565.04s]  So that what do you got left?
[8565.04s -> 8568.83s]  You get this one could go this one can continue.
[8568.83s -> 8569.53s]  I think it's this one.
[8570.14s -> 8571.34s]  No, I already got that one.
[8571.64s -> 8572.04s]  No, I didn't.
[8572.04s -> 8572.34s]  Yeah.
[8572.34s -> 8572.94s]  Oh fuck.
[8572.94s -> 8574.04s]  I did already get that one.
[8574.04s -> 8574.34s]  Oops.
[8574.34s -> 8577.48s]  What's funny is you just gave up on another ship.
[8577.58s -> 8579.28s]  I thought I was the three one, but I already got the three
[8579.28s -> 8579.48s]  one.
[8579.48s -> 8579.98s]  I'm an idiot.
[8580.46s -> 8580.86s]  Yeah.
[8582.69s -> 8583.19s]  Okay.
[8583.80s -> 8584.70s]  No, that wasn't the three one.
[8585.36s -> 8585.56s]  Oops.
[8585.56s -> 8586.06s]  Not yet.
[8586.36s -> 8586.76s]  Okay.
[8587.65s -> 8593.08s]  No, wait, I can just do I can do this.
[8594.74s -> 8596.70s]  No, Trevor.
[8596.70s -> 8597.80s]  Where is this ship?
[8597.80s -> 8601.98s]  Yes, there's only one inside my sonar area.
[8602.78s -> 8604.68s]  I'm painting a picture around this ship.
[8604.68s -> 8605.08s]  Aren't I?
[8606.13s -> 8612.49s]  Maybe wait, I think that might be one of the greatest.
[8613.12s -> 8613.92s]  Is it this?
[8614.91s -> 8616.81s]  Oh, yeah, it's it's my weird.
[8617.01s -> 8618.11s]  I don't even know what to call that.
[8620.83s -> 8621.13s]  All right.
[8621.13s -> 8621.93s]  I got to be careful there.
[8621.93s -> 8624.03s]  I don't I keep using my big one.
[8624.03s -> 8625.03s]  I don't want to use the big one again.
[8626.75s -> 8627.55s]  So you got another two.
[8627.55s -> 8628.35s]  It's probably here.
[8632.28s -> 8633.08s]  I'm saving points.
[8634.20s -> 8634.60s]  Okay.
[8634.60s -> 8635.00s]  All right.
[8635.00s -> 8637.10s]  I think that's a good strategy.
[8637.76s -> 8643.49s]  So you either have your two jutting out to the right my
[8643.49s -> 8643.79s]  God.
[8643.79s -> 8644.79s]  This is it.
[8644.79s -> 8646.59s]  There's only one spot 10 points now.
[8646.59s -> 8646.99s]  Don't you?
[8647.92s -> 8649.22s]  I have I have four now.
[8649.22s -> 8650.52s]  I've been using my sonar.
[8650.52s -> 8651.92s]  That's why I know that's right here.
[8655.04s -> 8658.54s]  I also have a couple of mines just lingering.
[8662.28s -> 8665.37s]  What where is this one going straight?
[8668.72s -> 8669.22s]  Okay.
[8669.32s -> 8669.52s]  All right.
[8669.52s -> 8670.72s]  I'm saving up my points here.
[8670.82s -> 8671.42s]  This is a hit.
[8671.90s -> 8672.50s]  There we go.
[8672.50s -> 8673.20s]  Finally.
[8673.20s -> 8678.88s]  It must be down snow there and to the left.
[8678.88s -> 8681.36s]  Wait, how does this work?
[8681.36s -> 8683.16s]  If it flips, it's the same.
[8683.16s -> 8688.73s]  So this can only go to the left.
[8688.73s -> 8689.13s]  You got it.
[8689.13s -> 8689.33s]  Okay.
[8689.33s -> 8689.73s]  You got it.
[8689.73s -> 8690.23s]  You got it.
[8691.24s -> 8695.34s]  This this other ship it's able to sneak in weird areas.
[8695.34s -> 8696.84s]  Let me let me try the barrage.
[8701.61s -> 8702.61s]  You have a barrage.
[8702.71s -> 8703.81s]  You have enough points for that.
[8704.25s -> 8708.55s]  Oh, I let me tell you I got barrage points over here.
[8708.75s -> 8710.85s]  You think we're not barrage and you're out of your mind.
[8720.03s -> 8721.53s]  Oh, come on.
[8722.10s -> 8723.10s]  That one's good.
[8723.83s -> 8734.85s]  It must be and then it has to go up.
[8735.45s -> 8738.45s]  I'm going to be able to like you feel I'm at so many points
[8738.45s -> 8738.95s]  now.
[8741.23s -> 8741.63s]  All right.
[8741.63s -> 8742.83s]  I need to win quick.
[8742.83s -> 8743.93s]  I'm a little nervous.
[8743.93s -> 8747.38s]  You only have a two bitch.
[8747.48s -> 8747.68s]  All right.
[8747.68s -> 8748.48s]  Let's just clear this.
[8751.58s -> 8751.98s]  All right.
[8752.48s -> 8754.18s]  This is I got I got to make something happen here.
[8755.36s -> 8757.56s]  Your torpedo is just such a weapon.
[8759.38s -> 8761.58s]  Well, you got to you got to clean up your food first.
[8765.09s -> 8765.49s]  Thank you.
[8765.49s -> 8766.29s]  Oh, no.
[8766.80s -> 8767.30s]  Okay.
[8769.82s -> 8771.22s]  Oh, it's not it's not worth using this.
[8771.32s -> 8779.45s]  Um, can I not move?
[8779.55s -> 8780.05s]  Where can I?
[8780.72s -> 8781.82s]  Oh, I get it.
[8782.12s -> 8782.52s]  Okay.
[8786.56s -> 8787.36s]  Oh, no.
[8789.24s -> 8792.54s]  What we need one one only one only one doesn't make any
[8792.54s -> 8793.04s]  sense.
[8793.34s -> 8794.34s]  One it's a lot of sense.
[8794.34s -> 8796.24s]  If you think about it, no way not too hard though.
[8796.34s -> 8796.94s]  Well, they go come on.
[8796.94s -> 8797.74s]  I have a two left.
[8798.88s -> 8801.28s]  Oh, I thought it was counting that one as the one.
[8801.95s -> 8805.29s]  No, no, no, no sonar.
[8805.29s -> 8807.29s]  There was a little crazy because you knew is connected.
[8807.39s -> 8808.79s]  Yeah, but I thought there would be something over here too.
[8809.23s -> 8809.63s]  Right.
[8809.63s -> 8810.33s]  That makes sense.
[8812.05s -> 8812.45s]  I like that.
[8812.45s -> 8814.15s]  You can only sonar where you shoot.
[8817.96s -> 8821.15s]  Whoa, that's not the what are you talking about?
[8821.82s -> 8823.42s]  I don't get I thought it was the one that was up in
[8823.42s -> 8824.02s]  the left.
[8825.01s -> 8827.38s]  Oh, oh, fuck.
[8827.98s -> 8831.89s]  You know, you're you have a one fatal flaw right now and
[8831.89s -> 8835.09s]  it's that you have started to ships and then just quit
[8835.09s -> 8835.49s]  on them.
[8835.59s -> 8836.69s]  But I don't want to give you the points.
[8836.79s -> 8838.29s]  I know where the I know where those are.
[8838.49s -> 8842.48s]  Oh, if I hit I get you get a point.
[8843.18s -> 8844.48s]  Oh, yeah, you're absolutely right.
[8844.48s -> 8844.98s]  I do.
[8847.31s -> 8854.62s]  Oh, I only shot that cut so I could sonar it.
[8856.24s -> 8867.95s]  Let's just want to I want to metal with your let's see
[8867.95s -> 8868.65s]  what happens here.
[8876.93s -> 8881.22s]  Why should I put this I can win this right now if I
[8881.22s -> 8882.42s]  actually do this, correct.
[8883.54s -> 8887.25s]  So you've got you've got a two left.
[8889.00s -> 8893.38s]  You've got a three which is either home and cancel this
[8893.58s -> 8896.67s]  it's either here or here.
[8897.07s -> 8899.70s]  Wait, no, it'd have to be I flipped out.
[8901.78s -> 8902.48s]  It has to be here.
[8905.64s -> 8907.34s]  I have to write this shit.
[8907.34s -> 8910.34s]  I'm stupid who tweets we talking about two tweets.
[8910.34s -> 8911.94s]  No, I'm gonna win right now.
[8911.94s -> 8913.04s]  I just think it's gonna take me a minute.
[8920.30s -> 8921.20s]  Wait, why does it say that?
[8921.50s -> 8921.90s]  Hold on.
[8923.19s -> 8923.59s]  What is this one?
[8923.59s -> 8926.38s]  Then is this one?
[8926.78s -> 8928.48s]  There's still a two hanging out somewhere.
[8928.48s -> 8932.38s]  It's this three one or this for one one, two, three, four.
[8934.37s -> 8934.87s]  I got it.
[8935.27s -> 8936.27s]  One, two, three, four.
[8936.27s -> 8937.17s]  That's the only thing it could be.
[8937.57s -> 8938.37s]  It couldn't be anything else.
[8938.37s -> 8941.27s]  It has to be here has to be it has to be here.
[8963.93s -> 8964.43s]  Fuck.
[8974.47s -> 8975.47s]  What's the end of your turn?
[8977.38s -> 8979.18s]  You got three choices here.
[8982.48s -> 8983.78s]  I don't think I have that few.
[8986.75s -> 8988.25s]  No, what do you mean?
[8990.12s -> 8990.72s]  How does that work?
[8990.72s -> 8991.32s]  I dropped a bomb.
[8991.32s -> 8992.42s]  Do I I hit your mind?
[8992.42s -> 8993.02s]  Is that fine?
[8994.08s -> 8994.98s]  Oh, it's fine.
[8995.08s -> 8996.68s]  I think it just ends your turn automatically.
[8996.98s -> 8999.38s]  Oh, oh, it went that way.
[8999.38s -> 9000.08s]  I thought it was.
[9001.84s -> 9002.54s]  Oh my god.
[9002.54s -> 9004.84s]  This I think this is a great game mode.
[9008.50s -> 9012.18s]  Jerma, I've thought of the tweet.
[9014.10s -> 9016.00s]  I'm actually very confident on this one.
[9016.86s -> 9018.66s]  I have to fucking win a game here.
[9019.46s -> 9020.56s]  You want to hear my idea?
[9020.56s -> 9021.56s]  What's what's the idea?
[9021.56s -> 9022.06s]  Let's hear it.
[9023.22s -> 9024.32s]  It's a combination.
[9025.02s -> 9026.22s]  I had that one one two.
[9026.22s -> 9029.72s]  I just went to I just you actually got every ship tagged.
[9029.72s -> 9031.12s]  It is just the wrong direction.
[9031.12s -> 9031.52s]  Yeah.
[9033.24s -> 9033.44s]  All right.
[9033.44s -> 9033.94s]  What's the idea?
[9033.94s -> 9034.44s]  Let's hear it.
[9035.04s -> 9041.17s]  Well, right now I have to I get one tweet and I also get a
[9041.17s -> 9041.77s]  shirt.
[9042.25s -> 9047.54s]  Yeah, you get a shirt so we could combine the two feasibly
[9049.21s -> 9051.91s]  where you wear a shirt and you have to tweet it out.
[9052.86s -> 9056.79s]  God and when I went to the bathroom earlier actually did
[9056.79s -> 9063.00s]  a bit of research and I'm really fond of this new merch
[9063.00s -> 9063.30s]  company.
[9063.30s -> 9065.92s]  I found called Mega Milk.
[9070.37s -> 9073.57s]  Yeah, I thought it'd be apt to get you a Mega Milk shirt
[9073.57s -> 9075.27s]  and then have you tweet it out.
[9076.51s -> 9078.41s]  Am I do I have to is this part of the almond thing?
[9079.95s -> 9081.95s]  Oh, it's just that because it's two tweets now the almond
[9081.95s -> 9083.05s]  thing totally separate.
[9083.92s -> 9087.22s]  Yeah, he just wanted a second wasn't even a just a second
[9087.22s -> 9094.26s]  tweet like a sex Twitter.
[9096.40s -> 9099.20s]  Yeah, you're gonna have to change it to 18 plus.
[9099.20s -> 9099.70s]  Let's go.
[9099.70s -> 9102.00s]  I'm I'm trying as hard as I can for this one.
[9102.00s -> 9104.40s]  I am gonna pull out all the stops for this one.
[9104.84s -> 9106.94s]  What I'm gonna I'm gonna try someone new.
[9106.94s -> 9111.32s]  I think because I like the the different strategies.
[9111.32s -> 9118.55s]  I'm gonna try we did a gamble is always lose.
[9118.65s -> 9119.75s]  He's a gambler too.
[9119.75s -> 9123.42s]  And he's winning over and over gamblers lose as long as
[9123.42s -> 9124.12s]  I keep sitting here.
[9124.12s -> 9127.82s]  I'll lose eventually but he's he's just has the special
[9127.82s -> 9130.02s]  awareness that I don't have.
[9131.39s -> 9133.09s]  I'm gonna try William Cars Lake.
[9134.98s -> 9136.88s]  All right, what are we doing for this one?
[9136.88s -> 9140.39s]  Yeah, we got a I'm open.
[9140.39s -> 9142.89s]  Look, you're the one who's down the most right now.
[9142.89s -> 9147.20s]  So I think it's it's only fair that you set the wager
[9147.20s -> 9150.60s]  where you want to about if I win I get to remove the
[9150.60s -> 9154.60s]  Mega Milk shirt tweet and hand it over to you.
[9155.36s -> 9157.86s]  You want me to tweet Mega Milk and you would have to
[9157.86s -> 9159.04s]  tweet the Mega Milk shirt.
[9159.24s -> 9160.24s]  I think that's reasonable.
[9160.24s -> 9163.34s]  But you understand that you're gambling here that this
[9163.34s -> 9165.04s]  is a more than a double or nothing.
[9165.04s -> 9166.34s]  What happens if I win?
[9166.64s -> 9171.16s]  What do you say you're getting rid of the tweet?
[9171.80s -> 9173.90s]  Do you are you getting rid of the shirt as well?
[9175.08s -> 9177.58s]  No, I still I will still wear that shirt.
[9177.58s -> 9179.28s]  All right, but that's not we don't know that we don't
[9179.28s -> 9181.88s]  we're not positive yet, you know, right?
[9181.88s -> 9184.98s]  Okay, I would agree with you that if if I didn't have
[9184.98s -> 9186.68s]  the tweet, I probably pick a different shirt.
[9188.78s -> 9193.08s]  I don't want to flood your Twitter like five tweets in
[9193.08s -> 9195.18s]  a row of like different weird things.
[9195.18s -> 9195.68s]  I'm doing.
[9196.08s -> 9198.78s]  Yeah, it would just be just insanely.
[9199.38s -> 9199.68s]  All right.
[9199.68s -> 9199.88s]  No.
[9199.88s -> 9200.88s]  Okay, so you reverse it.
[9200.88s -> 9201.48s]  You're just bent.
[9201.48s -> 9205.02s]  You're saying no you but if I win because I've already
[9205.42s -> 9216.79s]  earned the shirt and the tweet, give me just a moment.
[9217.71s -> 9219.91s]  I have to think this is this is difficult in the way.
[9225.28s -> 9226.38s]  I don't like these shapes.
[9227.94s -> 9232.08s]  I think what would be equivalent to that in my mind because
[9232.08s -> 9244.53s]  this is a full reversal is I would need for you to get
[9244.53s -> 9248.30s]  a full catboy costume.
[9250.96s -> 9259.66s]  Yeah tweet a picture in this cat made costume something
[9259.66s -> 9267.40s]  to the effect of I'm having a good time right meow.
[9272.86s -> 9275.66s]  So I'm removing the last tweet and giving you the
[9275.66s -> 9276.46s]  Mega Milk tweet.
[9277.64s -> 9281.44s]  But if I lose I have to let's just make sure I get this
[9281.44s -> 9281.94s]  correct.
[9282.94s -> 9285.24s]  I have to tweet a picture of me holding my stomach talking
[9285.24s -> 9285.84s]  about almonds.
[9285.84s -> 9286.54s]  I love eating almonds.
[9286.54s -> 9288.94s]  So I throw up and then I have to tweet a picture of me
[9288.94s -> 9290.84s]  in a Mega Milk shirt in the bathroom.
[9291.04s -> 9292.44s]  I was using the bidet or something.
[9292.92s -> 9293.22s]  Sure.
[9293.22s -> 9294.92s]  Yeah, and then I have to tweet a picture of me in a
[9294.92s -> 9297.62s]  catboy made outfit saying I'm having a good time right
[9297.62s -> 9298.02s]  meow.
[9298.02s -> 9299.72s]  That's what I stand to lose.
[9300.26s -> 9303.36s]  Yeah, because you have to understand this when you say
[9303.36s -> 9305.56s]  you're getting rid of yours and reflecting on me.
[9305.56s -> 9306.96s]  That's it's like twofold, right?
[9306.96s -> 9307.26s]  It's true.
[9307.26s -> 9309.86s]  It's almost like right now you owe me a hundred dollars
[9309.86s -> 9311.66s]  will just translate it to money and then I'm going to
[9311.66s -> 9312.26s]  owe you a hundred.
[9312.26s -> 9313.56s]  It's a $200 swing.
[9313.66s -> 9315.26s]  I would rather pay you thousand dollars right now.
[9316.46s -> 9319.90s]  Well money money has no no effect here.
[9326.63s -> 9328.52s]  I mean you're in wait.
[9328.52s -> 9329.52s]  No, no, no, not in a hole.
[9329.52s -> 9331.52s]  I want to make sure this is a good placement.
[9332.09s -> 9339.72s]  Yeah, I'm in you're sure about this.
[9341.73s -> 9342.13s]  Yes.
[9342.92s -> 9343.82s]  Wait, wait.
[9343.92s -> 9348.06s]  I sorry you need to you need to I I pulled up your
[9348.06s -> 9350.06s]  stream instinctively to see how your chat felt about
[9350.06s -> 9352.26s]  that and I just saw one of your ships placements on
[9352.26s -> 9352.86s]  the bottom.
[9353.37s -> 9355.27s]  You need you should change your ships.
[9356.28s -> 9358.08s]  I just accidentally cheated.
[9358.96s -> 9360.36s]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[9360.84s -> 9361.44s]  You might have been happy.
[9361.44s -> 9362.04s]  I close it out.
[9362.04s -> 9362.64s]  I close it out.
[9362.64s -> 9364.84s]  I just wanted to see what they thought about the Catboy.
[9364.84s -> 9366.24s]  But what if that was the game winner?
[9366.24s -> 9366.94s]  What if that was the one?
[9366.94s -> 9367.34s]  What was that?
[9367.34s -> 9368.14s]  That was the game winner.
[9368.14s -> 9368.54s]  Don't think of it.
[9368.54s -> 9369.74s]  It's it's battleship.
[9369.74s -> 9371.14s]  It could have been the game winner.
[9372.34s -> 9373.14s]  That was the game winner.
[9373.14s -> 9373.74s]  That could have been the game.
[9373.74s -> 9374.64s]  It was not the game winner.
[9374.74s -> 9376.74s]  I think I deserve you eating an almond for a tweet.
[9377.97s -> 9379.77s]  I'll eat an almond for a tweet on the house.
[9379.77s -> 9380.57s]  Yeah, that's fair.
[9383.54s -> 9385.14s]  Because you got the game winner.
[9388.40s -> 9391.16s]  I should have left it and you never would have clicked on
[9391.16s -> 9391.76s]  those faces.
[9392.16s -> 9393.86s]  You can still do all of that.
[9393.86s -> 9394.86s]  I don't know.
[9401.22s -> 9402.22s]  I'm not ready.
[9402.22s -> 9402.72s]  Oh my god.
[9402.72s -> 9404.62s]  I feel like I'm doing my hair in the mirror and it's just
[9404.62s -> 9405.32s]  not it does.
[9405.32s -> 9406.02s]  I don't like it.
[9408.05s -> 9410.55s]  I actually love my ships placement right now.
[9414.68s -> 9415.38s]  All right, let's go.
[9416.67s -> 9416.97s]  All right.
[9416.97s -> 9417.47s]  All right.
[9418.48s -> 9419.88s]  You still have torpedo man.
[9420.28s -> 9422.08s]  I choose a different person.
[9422.08s -> 9422.98s]  I chose airsprite.
[9422.98s -> 9423.38s]  You did.
[9424.14s -> 9425.44s]  Oh wait, we have the same man.
[9426.18s -> 9427.08s]  Oh, this is a mirror.
[9427.08s -> 9427.58s]  This is perfect.
[9427.58s -> 9427.88s]  Okay.
[9428.48s -> 9429.78s]  Oh, it's a nine.
[9430.58s -> 9431.78s]  Was it nine for the torpedo?
[9432.83s -> 9433.93s]  No, it was like six.
[9435.94s -> 9437.24s]  Okay, off rip.
[9437.78s -> 9438.68s]  Let's make this play.
[9440.57s -> 9442.17s]  No should say my money.
[9446.80s -> 9447.30s]  Oh my god.
[9448.32s -> 9449.32s]  It must be going up, right?
[9450.22s -> 9451.22s]  Oh, I thought you would have.
[9452.48s -> 9452.78s]  Okay.
[9452.98s -> 9453.38s]  All right.
[9459.14s -> 9465.99s]  Oh, oh, brutal.
[9465.99s -> 9468.99s]  Oh, that is really bad for me.
[9469.09s -> 9470.79s]  What a randomly place ship too, right?
[9470.79s -> 9474.62s]  It's it's, you know, as isolated as they could have made
[9474.62s -> 9474.82s]  it.
[9474.82s -> 9479.12s]  Unfortunately, that's that's oh no.
[9479.12s -> 9481.42s]  My Lord, no, please.
[9481.42s -> 9481.82s]  Please.
[9481.82s -> 9484.32s]  I know you're down bad, but cheating really.
[9484.72s -> 9488.42s]  Oh, no, no, you're in trouble.
[9488.82s -> 9489.62s]  Oh, no.
[9489.72s -> 9490.82s]  Well, I'm getting points.
[9490.82s -> 9492.12s]  I'm getting really rich.
[9492.12s -> 9492.72s]  There's a thing.
[9492.72s -> 9494.92s]  My brain has to take a second to think about where this is.
[9496.06s -> 9496.96s]  It's that way.
[9496.96s -> 9501.06s]  It's either or it could be anywhere, right?
[9504.90s -> 9506.10s]  I think you're a cheeky fuck.
[9507.30s -> 9507.70s]  Nope.
[9509.00s -> 9510.40s]  There's so many places it could be.
[9510.40s -> 9511.30s]  It's it's shocking.
[9512.77s -> 9512.97s]  Okay.
[9512.97s -> 9514.67s]  I am rich in points though.
[9516.70s -> 9519.40s]  Let's let's let's just do let's just chill.
[9519.40s -> 9523.44s]  Let's just do this is if it is anything, it could be the L
[9523.44s -> 9531.63s]  shape, but more realistically, I think this could be I could
[9531.63s -> 9532.63s]  secure the bag.
[9535.26s -> 9538.96s]  What's oh, yeah, yeah, let's do this because it's the L
[9538.96s -> 9539.26s]  shape.
[9539.26s -> 9540.46s]  It would be no, it doesn't.
[9540.84s -> 9541.24s]  Yeah.
[9542.64s -> 9542.94s]  Okay.
[9542.94s -> 9543.84s]  It is the L shape.
[9545.46s -> 9545.96s]  What?
[9548.02s -> 9548.42s]  Yeah.
[9548.72s -> 9550.62s]  Why fuck you fucking got it?
[9550.92s -> 9551.42s]  You got you.
[9551.42s -> 9552.12s]  What did I get?
[9552.12s -> 9554.52s]  You got you had you hit the wrong one.
[9556.52s -> 9558.82s]  I went for the bottom of the L so I could sonar.
[9559.39s -> 9560.99s]  Do I save my money for an airstrike?
[9561.86s -> 9562.06s]  Okay.
[9562.06s -> 9562.96s]  Yeah, let me do this though.
[9570.03s -> 9571.53s]  I've made a devious plot.
[9577.80s -> 9586.43s]  So it had if it's this then it has to be this way, right?
[9586.83s -> 9590.43s]  It has to be that way has to be it has to be this way
[9590.83s -> 9591.43s]  with this way.
[9591.73s -> 9593.53s]  If it's that which I don't know if it's that or not.
[9600.04s -> 9601.64s]  Well, this could be the big L.
[9604.71s -> 9605.81s]  I'm going to do something here.
[9608.00s -> 9609.20s]  You might think this is insane.
[9609.86s -> 9610.76s]  My God don't do it.
[9610.76s -> 9611.06s]  Come on.
[9612.69s -> 9613.19s]  Okay.
[9614.19s -> 9614.69s]  All right.
[9615.19s -> 9616.89s]  I have deduced what it is.
[9617.59s -> 9618.19s]  What is it?
[9619.44s -> 9619.84s]  I don't know.
[9620.28s -> 9620.88s]  I think it's the L.
[9626.63s -> 9627.33s]  It's the L.
[9627.70s -> 9628.60s]  Oh, it is the L.
[9628.80s -> 9629.40s]  Oh, which way?
[9638.84s -> 9639.84s]  He lives another day.
[9647.77s -> 9648.37s]  All right, let's go.
[9649.71s -> 9650.01s]  Okay.
[9650.01s -> 9656.54s]  I have I have an airstrike now fire at all cells.
[9656.94s -> 9658.34s]  What does it do?
[9659.26s -> 9660.86s]  Oh, it's it's it's like the torpedo.
[9666.61s -> 9686.72s]  Oh, that is the most OP thing I've ever seen in my life.
[9688.19s -> 9689.39s]  I gotta get one of those quick.
[9691.36s -> 9692.76s]  I gotta get one of those right now.
[9692.96s -> 9693.36s]  Damn it.
[9695.92s -> 9696.42s]  First of all,
[9696.42s -> 9697.52s]  Catboy Jerma.
[9698.96s -> 9699.96s]  What it's not the L.
[9699.96s -> 9700.96s]  It's not the L.
[9701.66s -> 9702.56s]  What are you talking about?
[9702.56s -> 9703.46s]  It's not the L.
[9703.46s -> 9704.26s]  What the hell is it then?
[9704.26s -> 9705.16s]  It's this little guy.
[9705.16s -> 9705.96s]  No, it's not.
[9705.96s -> 9707.06s]  What the fuck is happening?
[9707.06s -> 9708.06s]  It's this way.
[9711.89s -> 9713.49s]  The airstrike is so OP.
[9723.28s -> 9724.88s]  Like a baby having a tantrum.
[9731.06s -> 9731.36s]  All right.
[9732.26s -> 9736.77s]  Let's let's just keep it simple here.
[9737.17s -> 9740.10s]  So I this to right here.
[9741.08s -> 9745.30s]  Does it go down or does it go most likely here?
[9745.30s -> 9745.60s]  Right?
[9746.14s -> 9746.44s]  Right?
[9746.44s -> 9746.84s]  Yeah.
[9746.84s -> 9753.11s]  Which means this has to go and then that's I'm giving you
[9753.11s -> 9754.01s]  so many points.
[9755.50s -> 9755.90s]  That's right.
[9755.90s -> 9757.70s]  I think I've tagged every ship.
[9757.70s -> 9761.60s]  So I just need to I need to finish it out.
[9761.60s -> 9761.80s]  Now.
[9761.80s -> 9763.70s]  What is this one to the left down up?
[9763.70s -> 9764.40s]  I don't know.
[9765.42s -> 9767.62s]  Best odds are here, but it could be this one or this one.
[9772.04s -> 9773.44s]  Oh, so that must be this one.
[9774.57s -> 9774.97s]  What?
[9775.67s -> 9776.07s]  Wait, what?
[9777.27s -> 9778.17s]  Thank God.
[9778.47s -> 9780.07s]  It's down there.
[9780.57s -> 9781.37s]  You don't know where it is.
[9781.37s -> 9781.97s]  You have no idea.
[9782.57s -> 9783.37s]  It could be anywhere.
[9784.31s -> 9785.21s]  I do know though.
[9785.88s -> 9787.08s]  I do I do get it.
[9789.27s -> 9790.97s]  I shouldn't I shouldn't I should do this.
[9794.25s -> 9797.15s]  Are you you must be flush with points right now.
[9802.37s -> 9804.61s]  I am I got it.
[9804.61s -> 9806.41s]  I got to get the most amount of surface area here.
[9811.18s -> 9812.18s]  Oh, I got one.
[9812.28s -> 9812.98s]  That was your two.
[9814.35s -> 9815.75s]  You just suck it.
[9815.75s -> 9817.75s]  You literally just sunk it.
[9818.93s -> 9820.53s]  Oh no.
[9821.11s -> 9821.61s]  Oh God.
[9821.61s -> 9821.91s]  Okay.
[9821.91s -> 9822.31s]  All right.
[9822.31s -> 9822.71s]  All right.
[9822.71s -> 9823.21s]  All right.
[9823.71s -> 9823.91s]  All right.
[9823.91s -> 9824.81s]  This is bad.
[9825.01s -> 9826.31s]  This is now bad for me.
[9827.75s -> 9828.35s]  Okay.
[9828.95s -> 9831.65s]  Oh, I you're in trouble here, but so am I.
[9832.05s -> 9834.05s]  In a deep crock of shit.
[9836.20s -> 9837.90s]  This could be literally any one of these though.
[9838.20s -> 9840.27s]  I only have two ships left.
[9840.27s -> 9841.07s]  It can't be anything.
[9841.17s -> 9843.47s]  I mean, it's either it's either it's either this way or that way.
[9844.07s -> 9844.67s]  That is true.
[9844.77s -> 9845.37s]  And I got it.
[9846.08s -> 9848.38s]  Well, no, you didn't get it because there's a lot.
[9848.48s -> 9849.38s]  There's a lot that it could be.
[9849.38s -> 9849.98s]  That's right.
[9851.90s -> 9853.30s]  There is a lot that it could be.
[9854.78s -> 9859.22s]  Oh, wait, that's that's physically not possible for it to be that way.
[9859.32s -> 9863.65s]  What do you mean?
[9866.52s -> 9866.92s]  All right.
[9867.56s -> 9868.06s]  Okay.
[9871.23s -> 9873.43s]  So this this this has to be here.
[9874.26s -> 9876.26s]  We know that you do know that.
[9876.80s -> 9880.62s]  Oh, and so that that leaves me with a wait.
[9880.62s -> 9883.16s]  Am I am I still missing a ship?
[9884.01s -> 9885.51s]  I still haven't tagged one ship.
[9896.70s -> 9897.90s]  This is so nerve-wracking.
[9897.90s -> 9899.10s]  It's too nerve-wracking.
[9899.40s -> 9901.10s]  This has to be left or right.
[9914.02s -> 9915.42s]  I could put like my poker face.
[9915.42s -> 9916.02s]  I don't know what to do.
[9916.02s -> 9917.62s]  I just been hiding from the camera.
[9920.24s -> 9921.54s]  I don't I think an airstrike.
[9921.54s -> 9927.64s]  Here's a waste at this stage of the game.
[9927.64s -> 9935.38s]  The airstrike kind of you son of a bitch, you son of a bitch little bomb and it
[9935.38s -> 9939.08s]  just ends what happened when you get two counter shots.
[9939.18s -> 9939.98s]  What about that?
[9939.98s -> 9940.58s]  What just happened?
[9940.88s -> 9941.48s]  I don't know.
[9941.48s -> 9942.48s]  I have no idea what just happened.
[9942.48s -> 9944.88s]  I think since I hit it you get two counter shots or something.
[9944.88s -> 9946.38s]  I got two counter shots.
[9946.68s -> 9951.98s]  Yeah, I wouldn't even pay attention.
[9964.07s -> 9966.27s]  This tells me if it's a three or two ship.
[9967.20s -> 9968.50s]  Oh, it's a three ship.
[9984.14s -> 9987.10s]  You have some dastardly to somewhere.
[10010.08s -> 10011.18s]  No, you did not.
[10011.18s -> 10011.88s]  No way.
[10011.98s -> 10013.08s]  No way.
[10013.28s -> 10013.88s]  No way.
[10013.88s -> 10016.08s]  You got that this impossible.
[10016.28s -> 10017.78s]  It's not possible.
[10018.18s -> 10019.38s]  It's impossible.
[10020.28s -> 10028.24s]  Oh my God, why did you get that?
[10028.24s -> 10030.94s]  That was like a 4% chance to hit that one.
[10031.04s -> 10033.74s]  What I do is I flick my mouse and I click.
[10037.10s -> 10037.90s]  Oh my God.
[10037.90s -> 10040.30s]  That was the most stressful game.
[10044.07s -> 10048.16s]  Oh my God.
[10048.16s -> 10049.16s]  What the fuck?
[10049.66s -> 10050.76s]  That was insane.
[10050.76s -> 10052.06s]  Oh my God.
[10053.98s -> 10057.38s]  How do I even get anything shaved off of this?
[10057.38s -> 10057.88s]  Look at you.
[10057.88s -> 10059.18s]  Look at your guy's face.
[10059.18s -> 10060.48s]  He's so sullen.
[10061.55s -> 10063.85s]  Oh, that's this is okay.
[10063.95s -> 10064.55s]  At this point.
[10064.55s -> 10066.75s]  I almost own your Twitter account.
[10073.46s -> 10074.96s]  Even know what to do about this.
[10075.36s -> 10078.26s]  I want to keep playing to try to like get some of this back.
[10078.66s -> 10081.76s]  Yeah, but I can't like I can't even win a game.
[10082.36s -> 10082.96s]  No.
[10083.82s -> 10085.32s]  Okay, you know what?
[10085.62s -> 10086.72s]  You know what you could do.
[10087.97s -> 10092.77s]  We could make a what I owe you what it's it's three tweets three
[10092.77s -> 10095.17s]  tweets and like I feel I don't I feel like a shit in a bag
[10095.17s -> 10095.87s]  or whatever it was.
[10095.87s -> 10098.07s]  But what was it where shirt?
[10098.57s -> 10099.87s]  We have to wear a shirt.
[10100.57s -> 10101.57s]  It's three tweets.
[10101.57s -> 10103.17s]  It's 96 subs.
[10108.16s -> 10112.16s]  You know at this point I got a stream key $70.
[10117.63s -> 10118.23s]  Okay.
[10120.43s -> 10121.43s]  That's like the okay.
[10121.83s -> 10124.73s]  This is what happens to the person that gets last place in
[10124.73s -> 10125.63s]  Mario Party.
[10126.13s -> 10126.63s]  You know what I mean?
[10126.63s -> 10129.13s]  Oh, but you least we gave you fucking 10 coins.
[10129.33s -> 10131.93s]  Yeah, thanks in the final five turns.
[10131.93s -> 10133.73s]  They throw you a couple.
[10137.83s -> 10138.73s]  What is it?
[10138.73s -> 10139.43s]  What do you feel in your heart?
[10139.43s -> 10140.43s]  You want to win this back?
[10140.43s -> 10143.83s]  I can't imagine what to use the worst thing that you owe.
[10143.93s -> 10145.43s]  It's it's surely not the money.
[10145.97s -> 10149.47s]  No, it's it's it's it's definitely the last one.
[10149.47s -> 10151.84s]  You just said it's the cat made one.
[10151.84s -> 10152.64s]  That one's tough.
[10152.74s -> 10153.74s]  That one's tough.
[10154.04s -> 10159.38s]  Probably the last two last two tweets are rough but Twix the
[10159.38s -> 10160.48s]  cat in the milk.
[10160.58s -> 10164.90s]  Which one is worse both equal equally bad.
[10165.00s -> 10167.60s]  Equally well, I would have to get in and out going to outfit
[10167.60s -> 10167.80s]  it.
[10168.20s -> 10168.40s]  Okay.
[10168.40s -> 10172.37s]  Yeah, no, it's it's it's it's something it's it's surely
[10172.37s -> 10174.57s]  something but how do we how do we even give you an incentive
[10174.57s -> 10174.87s]  anymore?
[10174.87s -> 10175.67s]  You have ones.
[10175.87s -> 10176.97s]  Okay, you just won.
[10177.27s -> 10181.07s]  You sat at the blackjack table like 200 bucks and you have
[10181.07s -> 10182.97s]  like $15,000 in chips.
[10182.97s -> 10183.57s]  Like what do you care?
[10183.57s -> 10185.57s]  You know, I have I have my watch now.
[10186.20s -> 10188.00s]  Yeah, you have the watch or you don't even need to play.
[10188.00s -> 10189.40s]  You're like you're good.
[10189.88s -> 10191.48s]  This is I know I feel great.
[10191.48s -> 10195.78s]  I feel great about this, but I am I'm still a sucker.
[10195.98s -> 10197.78s]  For monetary investments.
[10197.88s -> 10203.54s]  Okay, so I'm willing to make you a wager you making me a
[10203.54s -> 10203.94s]  wager.
[10203.94s -> 10204.24s]  Okay.
[10204.24s -> 10207.62s]  What's the wager you right now?
[10208.92s -> 10211.42s]  Oh me a just a little under $500.
[10211.52s -> 10211.82s]  Sure.
[10213.71s -> 10222.65s]  Would you say that $500 is about how much one of those tweets
[10222.65s -> 10224.05s]  is milk boys worth?
[10229.11s -> 10232.01s]  Yeah, I would say so I would say $500 is probably what the
[10232.01s -> 10233.11s]  word that would be worth for me.
[10233.21s -> 10234.78s]  I think okay.
[10235.77s -> 10239.07s]  Here's what I'm going to do and you can decline this offer.
[10239.74s -> 10242.44s]  Because I think I'm more I'm willing to give up the Mega
[10242.44s -> 10244.84s]  Milk shirt tweet and stream.
[10244.84s -> 10246.34s]  I'm willing to give that up.
[10246.44s -> 10246.74s]  Wow.
[10246.74s -> 10252.65s]  Okay in exchange you already owe me $500.
[10253.68s -> 10258.48s]  Let's just say if you win, we'll just cut those.
[10259.14s -> 10259.54s]  All right.
[10259.54s -> 10260.74s]  They're just eliminated.
[10260.94s -> 10263.94s]  What so the two tweets with the costumes?
[10264.55s -> 10267.25s]  No, just well, let's not get in over our heads.
[10267.35s -> 10269.05s]  I'm trying to rewrite the contract here.
[10269.15s -> 10274.81s]  Yes, the milk boy tweet stream are gone.
[10275.60s -> 10281.77s]  Okay, in exchange if you win.
[10282.07s -> 10282.47s]  Okay.
[10282.87s -> 10283.17s]  All right.
[10283.17s -> 10287.90s]  If I win you still owe me all that but I need you because
[10287.90s -> 10293.72s]  you live in Vegas to take $1,000 go to the casino and put
[10293.72s -> 10295.13s]  it on black.
[10295.23s -> 10296.43s]  Oh my God.
[10296.73s -> 10300.63s]  And if I win that bet you have to give me $2,000.
[10303.78s -> 10304.98s]  It's a pretty good bet.
[10305.48s -> 10306.78s]  That's a thousand bucks though.
[10307.85s -> 10309.45s]  Well, you already owe me 500.
[10309.45s -> 10313.36s]  It's more like oh I know it's a $500 bet.
[10313.36s -> 10318.16s]  Basically, is this worth $500 to potentially erase now?
[10318.46s -> 10322.29s]  I will say if you lose you owe three tweets one stream
[10322.29s -> 10326.29s]  with a shirt on cat made outfit pregnant almond milk
[10326.29s -> 10326.79s]  boy.
[10327.09s -> 10330.09s]  You have to give me $1,000 to go to the casino with
[10330.09s -> 10330.29s]  it.
[10330.29s -> 10332.09s]  Put it on a roulette table on black.
[10332.80s -> 10333.50s]  It's a lot.
[10338.89s -> 10343.09s]  We we would you be willing to remove the cat made outfit
[10343.09s -> 10344.59s]  if we made this 1500.
[10346.16s -> 10351.25s]  Wow, that's how bad the cat made outfit is honestly like
[10351.75s -> 10353.35s]  tweeting in general.
[10353.93s -> 10359.80s]  It's like so like it's the tweets themselves.
[10360.10s -> 10362.90s]  Yeah, I could only dress up in any costume, but I have
[10362.90s -> 10368.24s]  to tweet like fuck the tweet is look I would almost be
[10368.24s -> 10372.24s]  creating enemies if I got rid of that for how just you
[10372.24s -> 10373.14s]  I mean look at your chat.
[10373.14s -> 10374.24s]  They're fervorish about this.
[10374.24s -> 10376.88s]  If I got rid of this they I mean they would be there
[10376.88s -> 10379.98s]  would be riots if they know what they're if they don't
[10379.98s -> 10380.58s]  let them fool you.
[10380.58s -> 10382.88s]  They already got something because you owe me 500.
[10382.88s -> 10385.58s]  You're saying it's basically a thousand dollars on this
[10385.58s -> 10389.28s]  game and I will literally I will literally like livecast
[10389.28s -> 10389.68s]  it to you.
[10391.62s -> 10392.82s]  I can't do that.
[10393.62s -> 10396.02s]  I can like I can I can take a picture before and after
[10396.02s -> 10398.92s]  and it's either gonna be like a picture of an audio
[10398.92s -> 10401.92s]  experience just do like your phone recording and you
[10401.92s -> 10404.22s]  can just audit auditorily bring me through it.
[10405.81s -> 10410.19s]  You know what look I I love catboy, but I would never
[10410.19s -> 10412.89s]  give I would never take away a man's opportunity to win
[10412.89s -> 10414.19s]  back his dignity.
[10415.01s -> 10415.41s]  So all right.
[10415.41s -> 10415.81s]  So hold on.
[10415.81s -> 10420.50s]  So if if so, this is all of if you lose this if I lose
[10420.50s -> 10423.87s]  this so we are just rid of the we are just going over
[10423.87s -> 10425.27s]  what happens at the end of this game.
[10426.00s -> 10429.98s]  So if if you win this game, yes, I have to do all of
[10429.98s -> 10432.58s]  that and I have to do the 1500 on black.
[10433.02s -> 10434.52s]  It's a lot you have to do a lot.
[10434.82s -> 10437.62s]  This is like an astronomical amount of stuff to do.
[10438.42s -> 10439.92s]  It's an insane list of errands.
[10439.92s -> 10442.62s]  It'll take you literally like weeks to accomplish
[10442.62s -> 10443.12s]  everything.
[10444.71s -> 10451.16s]  But if you win and you wipe out the two tweets, you
[10451.16s -> 10453.95s]  got to wipe you got to wipe out all three tweets all
[10453.95s -> 10454.95s]  three.
[10455.35s -> 10463.66s]  No, actually even though the almond one can stay really
[10463.66s -> 10464.86s]  there's so many terms of this contract.
[10464.86s -> 10466.06s]  We have to like write this down.
[10466.46s -> 10469.36s]  Oh, just to clarify you win.
[10470.09s -> 10474.83s]  You only have to go post the almond boy tweet.
[10474.83s -> 10476.23s]  Everything else is gone.
[10477.38s -> 10482.70s]  Yes, if I win, it's three tweets and hey, hold on.
[10482.70s -> 10483.80s]  I'll sweeten the deal.
[10483.80s -> 10484.70s]  I'll sweeten the deal for you.
[10486.01s -> 10490.75s]  If even if I win, I'll sweeten the deal you take you
[10490.75s -> 10492.65s]  get rid of those two tweets that the cat made out
[10492.65s -> 10496.02s]  for one and the mega milk tweet and I'll tell you
[10496.02s -> 10497.22s]  right now you delete those.
[10497.89s -> 10506.12s]  I'll do I'll do I'll do 250 on black with $250.
[10506.12s -> 10507.22s]  I'll do 250 on black.
[10508.04s -> 10511.45s]  That's that's lower than that's not sweeter.
[10511.85s -> 10513.55s]  Oh, that sweetens the deal because otherwise it
[10513.55s -> 10514.15s]  would have been wiped out.
[10514.15s -> 10514.85s]  I wouldn't have to do it.
[10515.64s -> 10518.94s]  Oh, you'll still do still do 250 for me.
[10519.04s -> 10520.62s]  Yeah, that's sweetening for you.
[10527.72s -> 10528.12s]  I'm in.
[10529.69s -> 10531.19s]  Oh, all right.
[10531.19s -> 10531.79s]  Let's go.
[10532.52s -> 10534.92s]  This is the final this is that we can't go past this
[10534.92s -> 10537.92s]  though because after this it's it's it's I mean,
[10537.92s -> 10540.42s]  it's it's it's like the deed to your home.
[10540.82s -> 10543.02s]  Yeah, I'm gonna start giving you like titles to cars
[10543.02s -> 10543.42s]  and stuff.
[10544.58s -> 10545.48s]  This is the last one.
[10545.48s -> 10545.88s]  Okay.
[10545.88s -> 10546.28s]  All right.
[10546.38s -> 10548.88s]  Oh gosh, I'm already nervous.
[10548.88s -> 10551.08s]  I can feel a lump forming in my throat.
[10553.06s -> 10553.56s]  All right.
[10553.86s -> 10556.16s]  I think I'm gonna keep it with William Cars Lake.
[10556.16s -> 10557.76s]  The airstrike seems pretty good.
[10558.39s -> 10558.99s]  I agree.
[10563.44s -> 10563.94s]  All right.
[10564.44s -> 10567.24s]  All right for everything really for everything here.
[10567.72s -> 10575.86s]  All these positions matter so much somebody said Fox
[10575.86s -> 10586.36s]  only from a lose lose lose.
[10586.36s -> 10588.46s]  I know you guys want me to lose cuz then I have that's
[10588.46s -> 10590.56s]  like two weeks of things that I have to do.
[10593.09s -> 10593.99s]  I have to win this.
[10593.99s -> 10595.29s]  I have to put on all the stops.
[10595.29s -> 10595.89s]  I've got to win.
[10599.12s -> 10601.52s]  What a difficult this is.
[10601.52s -> 10604.52s]  This is me taking like back shit that I have to do.
[10605.52s -> 10607.82s]  Honestly, even if I win I still lose.
[10607.92s -> 10609.22s]  I just don't lose as much.
[10610.23s -> 10612.93s]  Yeah, there's because there's there's zero risk for me,
[10612.93s -> 10613.23s]  right?
[10613.23s -> 10614.33s]  It's zero risk for you.
[10617.97s -> 10619.17s]  I'm clawing back.
[10619.17s -> 10623.71s]  You're you're getting more you're gonna lose now.
[10623.71s -> 10625.31s]  I like this.
[10637.99s -> 10638.89s]  Are you placing things?
[10639.56s -> 10640.46s]  I've placed everything.
[10640.46s -> 10640.66s]  Yeah.
[10640.76s -> 10643.06s]  Oh, I'm still on the waiting screen.
[10645.52s -> 10646.62s]  Oh, yeah, it does say waiting.
[10647.96s -> 10650.16s]  Do we do we need a real we may need a redo?
[10650.76s -> 10651.16s]  Okay.
[10651.16s -> 10651.66s]  All right.
[10653.76s -> 10656.26s]  Oh, yeah, I'm my games like frozen.
[10656.96s -> 10658.16s]  Let's let's reconnect.
[10658.16s -> 10660.86s]  I'll just try to remember this.
[10661.06s -> 10661.96s]  I'll just create a new one.
[10661.96s -> 10662.76s]  I'll send you the code again.
[10665.43s -> 10667.03s]  God is telling you not to do this.
[10667.86s -> 10670.86s]  Well, if God were telling me not to do this, he's got a weird
[10670.86s -> 10673.06s]  way of saying it because I have to literally dress up in three
[10673.06s -> 10677.56s]  different costumes and God wants you to dress up as a God.
[10677.56s -> 10682.86s]  I want me God wants this God is here with us on this battleship
[10682.86s -> 10683.26s]  board.
[10685.75s -> 10691.14s]  I've sent you the code Colossus Bay.
[10691.14s -> 10691.94s]  I am now in.
[10693.68s -> 10694.58s]  All right, should be good to go.
[10697.89s -> 10699.19s]  And here we go.
[10700.72s -> 10701.12s]  All right.
[10703.89s -> 10705.19s]  This is for all the marvels here.
[10707.14s -> 10708.14s]  I'm gonna have to do this.
[10708.54s -> 10713.34s]  There's swaths of people invested on my victory.
[10713.34s -> 10716.74s]  I almost have to turn my monitors off.
[10717.74s -> 10720.54s]  They're gonna like DM me on discord monitors off.
[10722.79s -> 10724.29s]  This is like an episode of schooled.
[10724.29s -> 10738.46s]  All right, I placed this one before it was here.
[10745.39s -> 10801.23s]  Remember you have to think I so I don't know what to do.
[10802.57s -> 10805.07s]  There's so many ways that this could go so wrong.
[10828.33s -> 10829.33s]  Okay, I'm done.
[10829.33s -> 10829.73s]  I'm done.
[10829.73s -> 10830.63s]  Oh my God.
[10834.27s -> 10834.97s]  Are you prepared?
[10837.43s -> 10837.93s]  Almost.
[10845.92s -> 10851.52s]  This is this is a preposterous amount of gambling on battleship.
[10855.57s -> 10857.47s]  I think it's you that's that must be you, right?
[10858.01s -> 10858.41s]  Yeah.
[10860.14s -> 10861.74s]  Okay, first shot is everything.
[10863.50s -> 10872.98s]  Oh no, it's two.
[10880.49s -> 10881.89s]  I thought it was the three.
[10881.89s -> 10883.89s]  I thought you put up I thought you put the three in a weird
[10883.89s -> 10884.39s]  place.
[10884.69s -> 10885.79s]  I'm not that cheeky.
[10885.79s -> 10886.79s]  I'm not that cheeky.
[10893.63s -> 10895.33s]  Let's let's play this strategically.
[10897.88s -> 10898.18s]  All right.
[10898.18s -> 10898.48s]  All right.
[10898.48s -> 10898.98s]  Now, whatever.
[10905.93s -> 10907.73s]  Don't remind at the very beginning.
[10911.80s -> 10912.90s]  This isn't a three.
[10914.06s -> 10917.21s]  It could I mean my best bet.
[10917.21s -> 10918.41s]  No, it's only one.
[10918.41s -> 10919.01s]  I should go here.
[10920.64s -> 10921.04s]  Yes.
[10923.59s -> 10923.99s]  Okay.
[10924.59s -> 10925.99s]  That's fucking phenomenal.
[10925.99s -> 10931.44s]  I mean, that's just oh my God.
[10933.99s -> 10935.79s]  Oh my God is doing this.
[10935.79s -> 10938.09s]  What the fuck Loki put the mask back.
[10938.89s -> 10940.59s]  What the fuck is this bullshit?
[10940.69s -> 10941.89s]  This is ridiculous.
[10941.99s -> 10944.69s]  There's no way no fucking way.
[10944.69s -> 10945.69s]  This is possible.
[10946.89s -> 10948.39s]  If I get the third one, I'm cheating.
[10950.74s -> 10954.64s]  No fuck that fuck that Poseidon throwing a goddamn trident
[10954.64s -> 10955.04s]  at me.
[10955.24s -> 10956.54s]  This is insanity.
[10956.74s -> 10957.54s]  This is insanity.
[10957.54s -> 10958.04s]  Okay.
[10958.34s -> 10959.34s]  Oh my God.
[10959.54s -> 10960.64s]  Oh my God.
[10962.08s -> 10963.08s]  Oh my God.
[10967.01s -> 10969.81s]  If you hit my if you hit my thing to me, let's just fucking
[10969.81s -> 10970.61s]  let's go.
[10971.51s -> 10973.81s]  Oh God, I love a God.
[10974.31s -> 10975.91s]  I'm a bomb fucking everywhere.
[10976.71s -> 10977.31s]  Over here too.
[10977.31s -> 10977.91s]  Let's go.
[10979.14s -> 10979.54s]  Okay.
[10982.36s -> 10984.16s]  My God, you just had so much money.
[10984.16s -> 10989.65s]  I didn't realize I just gave you the fucking Northrop gumption
[10989.65s -> 10990.15s]  supply.
[10990.15s -> 10992.75s]  I can't believe you just did like six in a row.
[10993.65s -> 10994.15s]  God.
[10995.05s -> 10995.85s]  Hey, is he going like this?
[10995.85s -> 10998.65s]  Is he like looking down like an iPhone that has like this
[10998.65s -> 10999.15s]  frame up?
[11001.39s -> 11002.09s]  I just have it.
[11002.19s -> 11002.59s]  All right.
[11003.59s -> 11004.29s]  I gotta think about this.
[11005.39s -> 11006.39s]  These are bigger than two.
[11007.49s -> 11014.86s]  So which means this could be the top one's hard because it
[11014.86s -> 11015.96s]  could be any of those four.
[11015.96s -> 11023.17s]  It could it's it's this one's gonna I bottom ones easier bottom
[11023.17s -> 11024.97s]  ones for the easiest one because it's literally you can go
[11024.97s -> 11025.57s]  one way or the other.
[11029.57s -> 11029.97s]  All right.
[11030.74s -> 11031.24s]  You know, it's good.
[11031.24s -> 11031.94s]  Well now it's hard.
[11046.18s -> 11047.18s]  Phenomenal guess.
[11047.38s -> 11047.68s]  All right.
[11049.52s -> 11050.02s]  That's good.
[11050.02s -> 11050.52s]  That was good.
[11050.92s -> 11052.22s]  But wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[11052.22s -> 11056.16s]  Not not quite as this could be this could be the Tetris
[11056.16s -> 11056.86s]  piece or the elf.
[11059.32s -> 11060.32s]  Yeah, that's fair.
[11077.44s -> 11078.74s]  Well, I know what it is now.
[11079.14s -> 11080.24s]  You do know what it is now.
[11080.24s -> 11083.79s]  Okay, I can't fucking believe what I'm looking at right here.
[11084.09s -> 11086.19s]  Oh, yeah, I just got three ships in a row.
[11086.69s -> 11090.92s]  I do.
[11093.93s -> 11094.33s]  All right.
[11094.63s -> 11096.83s]  The problem is you only have the good shit left.
[11097.80s -> 11098.40s]  That's true.
[11101.91s -> 11103.61s]  You son of a bitch.
[11103.61s -> 11104.21s]  That's huge.
[11105.27s -> 11106.27s]  That's actually huge.
[11108.42s -> 11110.22s]  Oh my god, you son of a bitch.
[11110.22s -> 11116.18s]  That's actually actually ignored the god.
[11116.18s -> 11117.28s]  This is this is bad.
[11117.28s -> 11118.38s]  This is really bad.
[11119.28s -> 11119.88s]  That's huge.
[11120.86s -> 11122.36s]  But can I capitalize on this?
[11122.86s -> 11125.36s]  I want a phenomenal start for that to happen.
[11125.46s -> 11127.06s]  Just a missed airstrike.
[11128.64s -> 11129.34s]  At the bottom.
[11129.84s -> 11130.14s]  All right.
[11130.14s -> 11138.18s]  Now I'm confused though, cuz is this the L go?
[11138.28s -> 11138.78s]  No.
[11139.08s -> 11140.58s]  Yeah, could the L go this way?
[11141.22s -> 11142.52s]  Can the L go that way?
[11142.52s -> 11145.94s]  I think it can to go like boom.
[11145.94s -> 11146.44s]  Boom.
[11148.55s -> 11151.67s]  I think the L could go that way as it goes boom.
[11151.67s -> 11152.07s]  Boom.
[11152.98s -> 11154.58s]  But that could also be the three.
[11155.41s -> 11156.11s]  I'm going for it.
[11157.82s -> 11158.22s]  All right.
[11158.22s -> 11159.12s]  I think I got you now.
[11159.22s -> 11159.72s]  I got you.
[11160.90s -> 11161.40s]  Wait, what?
[11161.98s -> 11162.98s]  Oh, no, you do not got me.
[11162.98s -> 11163.28s]  Okay.
[11163.28s -> 11163.98s]  What's what happened?
[11164.08s -> 11165.08s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[11165.48s -> 11166.28s]  Oh shit.
[11166.28s -> 11167.38s]  It's this way.
[11167.38s -> 11168.28s]  Oh, yeah.
[11175.82s -> 11176.32s]  Okay.
[11177.52s -> 11178.92s]  So it's just either up or down, right?
[11178.92s -> 11179.62s]  Simple enough.
[11184.89s -> 11185.99s]  Are you serious?
[11187.66s -> 11194.33s]  That's terrible.
[11194.43s -> 11197.03s]  I'm oh, I think I know where that is.
[11197.13s -> 11198.13s]  I think I know what you just did.
[11198.86s -> 11199.36s]  Oh, yeah.
[11199.56s -> 11200.06s]  I think so.
[11200.79s -> 11201.49s]  Take a try.
[11201.69s -> 11202.39s]  Take a gander.
[11213.34s -> 11214.04s]  I don't think you know.
[11215.34s -> 11219.50s]  I have abilities.
[11219.50s -> 11220.40s]  I'm saving the points.
[11220.40s -> 11221.40s]  It's gonna come in handy.
[11225.46s -> 11225.86s]  It's all right.
[11225.86s -> 11226.46s]  He's missing.
[11226.66s -> 11227.16s]  We're good.
[11232.82s -> 11233.22s]  All right.
[11236.67s -> 11241.98s]  Well, now at least I know what this is, right?
[11241.98s -> 11243.98s]  This is I'm not freaking myself out for no reason, right?
[11245.56s -> 11245.86s]  No.
[11245.86s -> 11246.06s]  All right.
[11246.06s -> 11253.66s]  I got you here now.
[11265.16s -> 11266.86s]  I think I'm gonna sonar this one here.
[11267.26s -> 11279.60s]  Why did I do that?
[11293.55s -> 11294.15s]  Why did I do that?
[11294.95s -> 11295.35s]  All right.
[11304.02s -> 11304.62s]  Two?
[11305.77s -> 11306.77s]  How could it be two?
[11309.46s -> 11310.76s]  I'm so confused.
[11310.86s -> 11311.56s]  What's going on?
[11312.23s -> 11314.13s]  This has to be the three.
[11315.25s -> 11316.25s]  But what the heck?
[11316.75s -> 11318.05s]  Why would it say there are two?
[11320.66s -> 11321.66s]  It's either this way or this way.
[11325.82s -> 11326.42s]  Wait a minute.
[11329.67s -> 11331.47s]  You got a motherfucker right here somewhere.
[11339.14s -> 11339.54s]  Yes.
[11344.41s -> 11345.51s]  Oh God.
[11346.62s -> 11347.82s]  The mines are terrifying.
[11363.79s -> 11364.49s]  What are you doing?
[11364.49s -> 11364.89s]  Are you placing a mine?
[11364.89s -> 11365.19s]  Fuck!
[11365.19s -> 11366.39s]  I'm freaking out.
[11366.39s -> 11366.79s]  All right.
[11367.87s -> 11368.17s]  All right.
[11368.17s -> 11368.37s]  All right.
[11368.37s -> 11368.77s]  All right.
[11369.24s -> 11369.94s]  I was placing a mine.
[11383.52s -> 11383.92s]  That's right.
[11383.92s -> 11384.42s]  That's a given.
[11384.62s -> 11385.22s]  It's pretty big.
[11387.78s -> 11389.38s]  A two and a three.
[11404.22s -> 11405.02s]  What's he up to now?
[11414.91s -> 11416.41s]  Another goddamn mine.
[11422.02s -> 11422.52s]  I'll just wait.
[11422.52s -> 11422.92s]  Patience.
[11422.92s -> 11423.52s]  Patience.
[11425.85s -> 11426.95s]  Well, wait.
[11426.95s -> 11428.85s]  Yeah, it has to be here.
[11429.15s -> 11430.65s]  No, but is that certain?
[11432.06s -> 11432.36s]  It is.
[11432.36s -> 11433.06s]  That's certain.
[11433.73s -> 11435.40s]  That's certain.
[11436.61s -> 11437.71s]  It's like Minesweeper.
[11437.71s -> 11439.01s]  This is it has to be here.
[11439.31s -> 11440.11s]  It is certain.
[11441.29s -> 11442.39s]  It's either here or here.
[11446.54s -> 11447.04s]  It's not certain.
[11447.04s -> 11471.44s]  I'll tell you that much.
[11473.34s -> 11475.44s]  So wait, does the sonar mean two ships?
[11475.44s -> 11477.64s]  Or does it mean two spaces where there are things?
[11479.12s -> 11480.82s]  I will I will grant you this.
[11481.12s -> 11488.26s]  It means there are two things in that area which includes mines.
[11488.46s -> 11495.98s]  A bunch of people in chat were saying it means there's two ships.
[11496.28s -> 11497.38s]  You fucked with me.
[11508.36s -> 11509.16s]  Oh, this could be anywhere.
[11522.43s -> 11522.93s]  Fuck.
[11522.93s -> 11523.13s]  Yes.
[11523.13s -> 11523.63s]  Fuck.
[11524.50s -> 11524.80s]  Come on.
[11524.80s -> 11525.40s]  Give me something good.
[11525.40s -> 11526.00s]  Something good.
[11527.37s -> 11527.87s]  Yes.
[11528.27s -> 11530.27s]  Dude, mines are the worst.
[11541.14s -> 11541.94s]  This is heating up.
[11541.94s -> 11542.14s]  All right.
[11542.14s -> 11544.64s]  So now so it has to be right here.
[11546.91s -> 11547.21s]  Right.
[11547.21s -> 11547.91s]  Of course.
[11548.11s -> 11548.51s]  Okay.
[11548.91s -> 11552.21s]  Now I just got two of your little shit ships.
[11552.21s -> 11553.71s]  My little shitters.
[11553.71s -> 11556.61s]  It's either on one side or the other.
[11556.91s -> 11558.11s]  So here's what I'm going to do.
[11558.82s -> 11560.02s]  I'm going to go like this.
[11564.33s -> 11567.93s]  Oh, what they'll get four shots for free.
[11567.93s -> 11568.33s]  Come on.
[11568.43s -> 11568.93s]  Come on, baby.
[11569.03s -> 11569.33s]  Come on.
[11569.33s -> 11569.73s]  Get me there.
[11569.73s -> 11570.23s]  Get me there.
[11570.53s -> 11571.03s]  Yes.
[11571.23s -> 11571.63s]  Yes.
[11575.05s -> 11575.55s]  Oh my God.
[11575.55s -> 11577.15s]  My mind strategy worked.
[11577.45s -> 11577.85s]  Wait a minute.
[11577.85s -> 11578.65s]  It's not over.
[11579.05s -> 11579.85s]  It's not over.
[11586.64s -> 11588.64s]  I flooded my field with mines.
[11600.53s -> 11601.63s]  Oh, I'm sweating.
[11624.95s -> 11625.45s]  Yes.
[11625.75s -> 11626.85s]  Oh no.
[11628.16s -> 11629.26s]  Oh, this is bad.
[11630.88s -> 11632.58s]  Oh, this is this is actually kind of bad.
[11636.13s -> 11637.33s]  I can't be so haphazard.
[11638.68s -> 11639.28s]  It ain't over here.
[11644.21s -> 11647.88s]  I think I think I got him right here.
[11650.12s -> 11651.32s]  I think I got him right here.
[11654.74s -> 11656.04s]  I think I got him right here.
[11657.26s -> 11660.42s]  It's either right here or it's right here.
[11662.18s -> 11663.58s]  Can I can I do it?
[11663.88s -> 11664.78s]  Did he do that?
[11664.78s -> 11666.58s]  Did he do it right in the middle?
[11687.48s -> 11687.88s]  You got it.
[11687.88s -> 11688.28s]  You got it.
[11688.28s -> 11689.88s]  But but but this could hit me.
[11689.88s -> 11690.48s]  This could hit me.
[11695.14s -> 11696.54s]  Oh, come on.
[11696.54s -> 11712.13s]  No, so it's here.
[11712.13s -> 11712.33s]  Here.
[11712.33s -> 11713.03s]  That's it, right?
[11735.52s -> 11736.02s]  All right.
[11736.02s -> 11736.52s]  All right.
[11736.52s -> 11738.72s]  So we're going to do one more.
[11739.02s -> 11748.30s]  We're going to do one more at this point.
[11749.10s -> 11752.04s]  Last one is more about.
[11754.34s -> 11755.94s]  Offer a man who has it all.
[11761.86s -> 11764.84s]  All right, so shit.
[11772.52s -> 11773.62s]  What do I even owe you?
[11773.62s -> 11778.59s]  I owe you like you won the showcase on the price is right.
[11778.59s -> 11780.39s]  There's nothing more I could even offer you.
[11781.69s -> 11784.99s]  I won the free trip to Hawaii from United Airlines.
[11785.19s -> 11787.39s]  I won the house in Malibu.
[11787.79s -> 11790.79s]  I won the entire Lexus car.
[11791.65s -> 11792.85s]  You got both showcases.
[11792.85s -> 11794.15s]  They don't even do that on the show.
[11794.76s -> 11799.26s]  I think I got I feel like James Holtz hour right now.
[11800.76s -> 11803.96s]  The most winning game show contestant of all time.
[11812.53s -> 11816.73s]  Well, that was that was a blast.
[11817.13s -> 11820.23s]  I'm glad I owe three weeks of content.
[11823.03s -> 11824.03s]  It's so much.
[11824.33s -> 11825.43s]  It's almost too much.
[11826.03s -> 11828.33s]  I will say does this make it easier?
[11830.09s -> 11833.79s]  We can space it out, you know, a payment plan.
[11833.79s -> 11836.99s]  So to speak a monthly payment plan.
[11837.39s -> 11841.29s]  Yeah, you know, we can't just do three tweets in a week or something.
[11841.29s -> 11842.49s]  That's a that's absurd.
[11842.79s -> 11844.19s]  I'm the ball by almonds.
[11845.56s -> 11846.46s]  You do need a ball.
[11846.46s -> 11848.53s]  That's that's the least of your concerns.
[11848.53s -> 11849.83s]  Almonds are easy to come by.
[11851.98s -> 11852.28s]  All right.
[11852.28s -> 11854.88s]  Can I can I consolidate this this internet?
[11854.88s -> 11856.08s]  Can I just consolidate this?
[11857.31s -> 11857.71s]  Yeah.
[11858.28s -> 11858.58s]  Okay.
[11859.08s -> 11859.88s]  Here's my offer.
[11860.38s -> 11864.98s]  Please one tweet in a catboy outfit with almonds in front of me looking
[11864.98s -> 11869.88s]  into the mirror of an oven with the stomach sticking out stomach.
[11869.88s -> 11871.08s]  Big big glow.
[11871.08s -> 11872.38s]  I eat too many almonds, whatever.
[11872.68s -> 11875.08s]  And like I have like a mega milk photo behind me.
[11878.22s -> 11884.00s]  I will I will allow you to consolidate two of the tweets into one.
[11884.40s -> 11887.81s]  Three is a bit.
[11888.83s -> 11892.53s]  It's a bit what the almond tweets your tweet, right?
[11893.39s -> 11894.59s]  Technically that technically.
[11894.59s -> 11894.79s]  Yeah.
[11894.99s -> 11895.29s]  Yep.
[11896.69s -> 11898.09s]  So I feel fine.
[11898.39s -> 11901.89s]  What if we just consolidate cat in milk into one?
[11909.97s -> 11912.27s]  I did not think I was going to be having this conversation.
[11913.92s -> 11916.42s]  Oh, let's combine cat and milk into one.
[11916.42s -> 11920.12s]  I'm just sitting there like we were going to play Battleship a mega milk
[11920.12s -> 11931.02s]  made if you will like you at some like a doorstep like an old with an
[11931.02s -> 11935.96s]  old-timey bag of milk, you know, like like a tree like you got all of
[11935.96s -> 11936.46s]  your six.
[11936.56s -> 11936.86s]  Okay.
[11936.86s -> 11938.86s]  Could I just have a huge thing of milk?
[11939.26s -> 11940.76s]  That's a that's a mega milk.
[11940.76s -> 11941.26s]  You know what I mean?
[11941.26s -> 11942.26s]  That's a lot of milk.
[11942.66s -> 11945.16s]  How much milk a huge amount?
[11945.56s -> 11947.86s]  It would need to be minimum like five gallons.
[11948.06s -> 11949.66s]  I don't know if I even get that much.
[11950.20s -> 11951.00s]  Well, that's what I'm saying.
[11951.00s -> 11951.80s]  Like how big is this?
[11951.80s -> 11956.17s]  Because a gallon of milk is like that's normal two gallons even somewhat
[11956.17s -> 11967.94s]  feasible, but standard what how about we consolidate it easily, right?
[11967.94s -> 11969.44s]  You so it's you, right?
[11970.48s -> 11976.68s]  Hey, it's me, Jerma and you're wearing a cat boy costume, but it's a
[11976.68s -> 11978.38s]  cat made outfit, right?
[11978.48s -> 11978.78s]  Okay.
[11979.08s -> 11983.38s]  And you're and you have like the milk delivery cartons and it's just
[11983.38s -> 11987.18s]  like like a perspective of someone opening their door to greet you.
[11987.48s -> 11991.58s]  And then the caption is mega milk made and you know, I feel like
[11991.58s -> 11993.58s]  that's a good consolidation there.
[11995.15s -> 11997.52s]  Oh, that's somehow worse.
[11997.82s -> 12001.95s]  So it's way worse it for that.
[12001.95s -> 12008.67s]  I I would almost be willing to just, you know, throw out the almond
[12008.67s -> 12011.10s]  tweet, you know, we for mega milk made.
[12011.80s -> 12015.40s]  That's just one big juicy tweet.
[12018.50s -> 12020.94s]  It needs to be almond milk.
[12021.84s -> 12022.44s]  Yeah.
[12022.74s -> 12024.34s]  Yeah, it's mega milk made.
[12024.54s -> 12030.13s]  You're not wearing a cat made outfit and and you have almond milk
[12030.13s -> 12033.13s]  that you're delivering with the caption mega milk made.
[12035.04s -> 12040.17s]  Can we play one more for what for me to look at me?
[12040.17s -> 12040.67s]  Look at me.
[12040.67s -> 12041.37s]  Do you see me?
[12044.67s -> 12046.87s]  Three hours and 20 minutes has changed you.
[12046.87s -> 12050.50s]  You do look concerned in a way.
[12050.60s -> 12052.60s]  Like I would be concerned if I walked by you.
[12052.70s -> 12053.00s]  All right.
[12053.00s -> 12053.40s]  All right.
[12053.40s -> 12058.30s]  His art is we're gonna do we're gonna do we're gonna do one more.
[12058.60s -> 12059.20s]  One more.
[12061.69s -> 12062.49s]  How do I even?
[12062.59s -> 12062.89s]  All right.
[12063.59s -> 12065.94s]  We're gonna fuck.
[12065.94s -> 12066.44s]  Okay.
[12066.44s -> 12068.71s]  So this is how it's uh-huh.
[12068.81s -> 12071.21s]  So I will accept your omega milk made.
[12071.79s -> 12072.29s]  Okay.
[12072.29s -> 12072.69s]  Okay.
[12073.09s -> 12074.09s]  I accept that offer.
[12074.56s -> 12074.96s]  Right.
[12077.81s -> 12084.93s]  So this next one is to I don't even know how I even all right.
[12084.93s -> 12086.53s]  This is to do a fuck.
[12086.63s -> 12087.03s]  Okay.
[12088.03s -> 12090.63s]  This next game because we already know the tweets happening, right?
[12090.63s -> 12092.23s]  Like I'm not going to be like, well, check that out.
[12092.23s -> 12093.53s]  But okay, sure.
[12093.63s -> 12095.73s]  This next game and this is the final game.
[12095.73s -> 12096.23s]  This is it.
[12096.33s -> 12099.53s]  This is the final game is it is by the way, it's been a blast.
[12099.53s -> 12100.13s]  It's been a pleasure.
[12100.53s -> 12101.83s]  I've had a great time today.
[12101.83s -> 12102.93s]  It's been absolutely fun.
[12102.93s -> 12103.83s]  Fantastically fun.
[12105.10s -> 12113.13s]  This is to solely if I win is to remove remove the cat costume.
[12115.04s -> 12118.64s]  So you would be delivering milk as a mega milk made but without
[12118.64s -> 12119.84s]  the cat costume in this picture.
[12119.84s -> 12123.12s]  Now, are you wearing the mega milk shirt?
[12125.17s -> 12129.91s]  Um, it's really nailed down the T's in the eyes here.
[12132.76s -> 12134.26s]  I think I'd probably rather just be the cat.
[12135.70s -> 12140.26s]  Well, let's pick a poison here because look you you're down bad.
[12140.26s -> 12143.06s]  But hey, I want to help you refinance restructure.
[12146.72s -> 12150.32s]  That laugh was just like that was such like a perfect evil laugh.
[12153.06s -> 12155.26s]  I would love to help you restructure this now.
[12155.26s -> 12157.26s]  Let's let's just talk brass tacks.
[12157.26s -> 12163.46s]  Are we more scared of the cat or the milk because we're going
[12163.46s -> 12164.56s]  to have to pick a poison here.
[12164.56s -> 12166.66s]  We got to go down a road Robert Frost style.
[12166.66s -> 12173.69s]  We got to pick one now, you know is is a the lesser of two
[12173.69s -> 12179.55s]  evils or the evil or I think it's the evil or you do you see
[12179.55s -> 12181.55s]  my my vision of this image of this tweet.
[12181.55s -> 12185.35s]  It's delivering milk as a mega milk made with a cat costume.
[12185.65s -> 12187.65s]  It's it's it's got to it's got to be up there.
[12188.45s -> 12190.85s]  I mean this thing's going to be downloaded, you know, let me
[12190.85s -> 12192.75s]  just say that this is how this is going to be downloaded.
[12192.75s -> 12195.85s]  So I mean the amount of fan art that will come from this will
[12195.85s -> 12197.35s]  teach artists for years.
[12198.28s -> 12200.98s]  It's just like this is going to be the modern-day scream.
[12200.98s -> 12205.47s]  It's going to be recreated so many times I am down to just
[12205.47s -> 12208.67s]  let's just remove the cat in this next wager.
[12208.67s -> 12211.87s]  Let's just get rid of the cat and you are now just you just
[12211.87s -> 12214.57s]  wear a shirt that happens to say mega milk which which could
[12214.57s -> 12215.37s]  mean anything.
[12217.55s -> 12218.95s]  All right delivering almond milk.
[12219.05s -> 12219.25s]  All right.
[12219.25s -> 12222.78s]  What if I lose this something else that you can add?
[12222.78s -> 12226.96s]  I you're just giving me like oats which I very much appreciate
[12226.96s -> 12227.56s]  by the way.
[12228.30s -> 12232.42s]  That's that's what happens if you want if you lose unfortunately
[12232.42s -> 12232.92s]  the cat.
[12233.49s -> 12236.59s]  How about this cat if I lose if I lose this no more like oh
[12236.59s -> 12238.79s]  double down remember if I lose it's over.
[12238.79s -> 12239.19s]  That's it.
[12239.69s -> 12240.59s]  It's locked in.
[12240.69s -> 12242.09s]  How about yeah, I am down.
[12242.19s -> 12243.19s]  That's what I win.
[12243.39s -> 12247.80s]  If I win this is that it just it's almost like I'm able to
[12247.80s -> 12251.44s]  walk away from the table and it has to be done.
[12251.44s -> 12255.98s]  It's like we'll we'll just nod at each other in passing knowing
[12255.98s -> 12258.38s]  that the deal has been done and it's it's been written in
[12258.38s -> 12258.78s]  ink.
[12258.98s -> 12260.74s]  Okay, it's over.
[12261.75s -> 12262.05s]  Yeah.
[12262.05s -> 12264.65s]  So it you you pressed and fake prices.
[12267.72s -> 12269.62s]  So what wait what what was the next part?
[12269.62s -> 12273.72s]  I said if if I win the deals over call it done.
[12273.72s -> 12274.22s]  That's it.
[12274.22s -> 12276.96s]  We're going to be you know, nodding as we pass and fake
[12276.96s -> 12277.46s]  breasts.
[12280.62s -> 12282.22s]  No, I'll walk away from the table right now.
[12284.20s -> 12284.60s]  I'm kidding.
[12284.80s -> 12285.30s]  I'm kidding.
[12285.30s -> 12285.70s]  I'm kidding.
[12285.70s -> 12286.10s]  Come on.
[12286.10s -> 12287.70s]  We we can joke around.
[12287.70s -> 12293.87s]  You know, this this these keep getting we're getting more
[12293.87s -> 12295.77s]  and more and more things added.
[12295.87s -> 12296.17s]  Eventually.
[12296.17s -> 12296.67s]  What are you going to?
[12296.67s -> 12298.27s]  I'm going to have to put like something on my head like a
[12298.27s -> 12299.17s]  crown or something.
[12299.17s -> 12300.17s]  What what's next?
[12300.17s -> 12303.17s]  SpaceX ship about to launch.
[12303.17s -> 12306.07s]  All right with your adding creative character shit bald
[12306.07s -> 12306.67s]  head.
[12308.29s -> 12316.12s]  No, no, I actually am happy to wager cat for for deal being
[12316.12s -> 12316.72s]  done.
[12319.28s -> 12322.30s]  And that and then just and that's good for me.
[12322.30s -> 12322.70s]  And that's it.
[12322.70s -> 12323.10s]  And that's it.
[12323.10s -> 12324.10s]  And then that's it's over.
[12324.48s -> 12328.56s]  Yeah, this is just this is more of a give really giving me
[12328.56s -> 12329.16s]  it out.
[12329.86s -> 12330.96s]  It's kind of giving you it out.
[12330.96s -> 12331.66s]  It's also like ball.
[12331.66s -> 12332.26s]  Don't lie.
[12332.26s -> 12332.76s]  You know what I mean?
[12333.86s -> 12336.06s]  You know, I'm shooting the extra shot.
[12336.06s -> 12337.56s]  We're contesting it ball.
[12337.56s -> 12338.06s]  Don't lie.
[12338.06s -> 12339.76s]  If I win this one, then I mean, it's true.
[12339.76s -> 12340.56s]  It's there's nothing else.
[12340.56s -> 12343.46s]  You're just giving me an extra life here to basically go back
[12343.46s -> 12347.49s]  one of the layers of onions, but I but also if I win it's
[12347.49s -> 12349.99s]  like it's so reaffirmed that you couldn't argue it, which
[12349.99s -> 12351.59s]  is which is this is no argument.
[12351.59s -> 12352.49s]  It's like this is yeah.
[12353.86s -> 12354.16s]  All right.
[12354.16s -> 12354.66s]  Let's do it.
[12357.18s -> 12359.48s]  There's almost a meta that's formed right now.
[12369.18s -> 12371.48s]  Yeah, I don't I don't know what to do here.
[12373.30s -> 12375.10s]  I have no idea how to place my ships.
[12407.62s -> 12409.22s]  Everything looks so wrong to me.
[12423.26s -> 12425.06s]  I mean everything just looks so wrong.
[12437.92s -> 12438.72s]  This is crazy.
[12463.26s -> 12464.16s]  This is crazy.
[12464.16s -> 12475.33s]  But I think I'm happy with this now.
[12475.33s -> 12475.63s]  I am.
[12475.73s -> 12477.23s]  No, now I am.
[12477.80s -> 12478.80s]  No, now I am.
[12482.29s -> 12482.89s]  I'm happy with this.
[12512.23s -> 12514.66s]  Go I am.
[12514.66s -> 12516.06s]  I am panicking over here.
[12516.06s -> 12516.46s]  Not ready.
[12546.63s -> 12547.73s]  So hard to avoid.
[12569.51s -> 12569.81s]  Fuck it.
[12569.81s -> 12570.21s]  Whatever.
[12578.08s -> 12578.38s]  All right.
[12578.38s -> 12578.68s]  Fuck it.
[12578.68s -> 12579.08s]  Fuck it.
[12579.08s -> 12579.38s]  Fuck it.
[12579.38s -> 12579.78s]  Let's go.
[12580.78s -> 12581.48s]  Oh God.
[12581.58s -> 12581.78s]  All right.
[12581.78s -> 12582.28s]  Come on, baby.
[12582.28s -> 12582.48s]  Come on.
[12582.48s -> 12582.88s]  Give me tails.
[12582.88s -> 12583.48s]  Give me tails.
[12586.14s -> 12587.14s]  That's both of us, isn't it?
[12587.88s -> 12589.18s]  Yeah, but I'm silver.
[12589.18s -> 12592.30s]  You're bronze, right?
[12592.30s -> 12597.66s]  What I found to be one of the best strategies is this.
[12601.62s -> 12603.12s]  Not as good of a start for sure.
[12604.22s -> 12607.02s]  I did have a godlike start and it was a close game too.
[12610.96s -> 12611.46s]  Oof.
[12611.46s -> 12611.96s]  Oof.
[12612.06s -> 12613.46s]  Bit of a mind war we have here.
[12613.46s -> 12614.86s]  This is more mind sweeper than battleship.
[12614.86s -> 12615.36s]  It is.
[12617.30s -> 12618.60s]  He's more man than machine.
[12618.80s -> 12619.20s]  Damn it.
[12628.32s -> 12628.82s]  Come on.
[12635.04s -> 12635.54s]  Do that.
[12637.04s -> 12638.44s]  Just a couple of mines.
[12638.44s -> 12638.84s]  All right.
[12638.94s -> 12641.04s]  So you go in mind strategy here.
[12641.64s -> 12643.54s]  Well, it gives you two hits.
[12643.94s -> 12648.04s]  So anytime you do an airfield sweep, it's just like game over.
[12661.38s -> 12662.18s]  More mines.
[12662.18s -> 12663.78s]  You're really going with the mines here.
[12664.18s -> 12664.68s]  Mm-hmm.
[12665.70s -> 12666.20s]  Hmm.
[12668.36s -> 12669.96s]  It also fucks up your sonar.
[12670.06s -> 12671.86s]  I mean, yeah, it does.
[12675.23s -> 12676.03s]  It truly does.
[12688.76s -> 12690.06s]  There's so much meta.
[12695.97s -> 12698.37s]  What are you thinking of doing?
[12700.18s -> 12701.38s]  Where did you put that?
[12701.38s -> 12702.58s]  You son of a bitch.
[12707.84s -> 12709.24s]  This is the most tense.
[12709.64s -> 12712.34s]  Somebody you're looking over with a stack of $100 bills.
[12712.64s -> 12716.15s]  I've got like 50 cents on the table and I want I just want you
[12716.15s -> 12718.25s]  wiped out and you're just like, oh boy.
[12718.25s -> 12719.35s]  That was tricky.
[12719.35s -> 12720.65s]  Wow, tricky for that one.
[12720.65s -> 12722.15s]  And I'm just like, yeah, it was really tricky.
[12722.15s -> 12723.65s]  I got 50 cents.
[12735.71s -> 12740.02s]  Well, well, well, well, what do we have here?
[12741.56s -> 12741.96s]  Not there.
[12745.88s -> 12747.18s]  I'm just copying him.
[12748.59s -> 12751.49s]  He's once five straight games in a row.
[12751.49s -> 12753.49s]  Why would I not want to do what he's doing?
[12758.42s -> 12758.82s]  Okay.
[12758.92s -> 12759.42s]  All right.
[12760.56s -> 12761.36s]  Where are you going now?
[12762.22s -> 12763.12s]  You put a bomb over here.
[12763.66s -> 12764.06s]  I did.
[12764.46s -> 12774.26s]  Did there it is God my God.
[12774.26s -> 12775.56s]  That is so huge.
[12775.66s -> 12787.32s]  That's blessed thinking about putting a mine over there.
[12790.02s -> 12790.92s]  I knew it.
[12791.52s -> 12793.12s]  Devious devious.
[12793.22s -> 12793.62s]  Okay.
[12793.72s -> 12794.12s]  All right.
[12794.63s -> 12795.23s]  Let's do this.
[12795.23s -> 12796.73s]  Let's let's sweep this here.
[12801.62s -> 12803.82s]  What did you do up here?
[12803.82s -> 12804.32s]  Nothing.
[12808.30s -> 12812.46s]  So that that's either your L or more realistically some
[12812.56s -> 12813.06s]  hug boat.
[12813.06s -> 12821.61s]  That's just been did I just find your L?
[12822.51s -> 12823.71s]  Oh, I just found it.
[12826.75s -> 12827.45s]  How are we?
[12829.82s -> 12833.72s]  Oh my God, I just found your L perfectly.
[12835.02s -> 12836.52s]  I thought that was a minefield for sure.
[12836.52s -> 12836.82s]  Okay.
[12836.92s -> 12837.12s]  All right.
[12837.12s -> 12837.82s]  You're rich now though.
[12837.82s -> 12844.86s]  That's concerning my best bet, right?
[12851.70s -> 12854.30s]  I still don't have anything of yours even uncovered.
[12855.29s -> 12858.02s]  Well, you have a sweep over there.
[12858.75s -> 12876.14s]  Yeah, but why just airstrike right down the middle or just
[12876.14s -> 12878.74s]  airstrike over here because I'll know those eventually.
[12884.01s -> 12884.91s]  I think that's the play.
[12886.54s -> 12887.04s]  That's the play.
[12892.64s -> 12894.24s]  Oh, that is that was one of your twos.
[12894.44s -> 12895.74s]  That was one of my twos.
[12899.96s -> 12900.76s]  Oh, why does that?
[12900.76s -> 12902.46s]  Why is that even a thing that can happen?
[12903.64s -> 12904.44s]  What is this?
[12904.54s -> 12905.34s]  What happened?
[12905.74s -> 12908.44s]  My my random missile.
[12909.14s -> 12912.34s]  My spot which triggered you hitting me which could just
[12912.34s -> 12913.74s]  be a forever chain.
[12913.94s -> 12914.84s]  Oh, that's funny.
[12915.96s -> 12916.26s]  All right.
[12916.26s -> 12921.98s]  Well, I you have the two you didn't put two twos up here.
[12921.98s -> 12929.83s]  Did you damn it?
[12930.30s -> 12932.30s]  It's really hoping you'd go for row three.
[12935.04s -> 12941.28s]  I think you did you didn't I thought you did like a one
[12941.28s -> 12943.48s]  two just trying to be a weirdo like I like I would have
[12943.48s -> 12945.28s]  like you would have freaked me out or something.
[12946.08s -> 12948.48s]  No, no, none of that none of that shenanigans are you
[12948.48s -> 12953.81s]  you must be here just have to be are you serious?
[12953.91s -> 12954.51s]  No, man.
[12955.66s -> 12955.86s]  All right.
[12955.86s -> 12956.46s]  Let's do this.
[12960.47s -> 12961.27s]  Oh, okay.
[12964.19s -> 12964.69s]  All right.
[12964.89s -> 12965.49s]  All right.
[12965.89s -> 12969.66s]  I'm narrowing it down bit by bit inch by inch.
[12970.96s -> 12978.62s]  Oh you all right.
[12978.82s -> 12979.32s]  There you are.
[12980.42s -> 12981.32s]  Did find me.
[12985.48s -> 12986.48s]  Here's the real question though.
[12986.48s -> 13001.48s]  Is this your L or is this your your three your three?
[13002.86s -> 13005.46s]  Oh, this is a tight war right now.
[13007.02s -> 13020.67s]  Now here you are.
[13022.59s -> 13023.19s]  Here you are.
[13024.51s -> 13025.71s]  Say like such a villain.
[13028.19s -> 13028.79s]  Okay.
[13031.90s -> 13038.54s]  They are this could be your Tetris shape in the top left.
[13039.11s -> 13040.31s]  No, it can't be bottom, right?
[13041.48s -> 13041.78s]  Thank you.
[13041.78s -> 13043.72s]  Fuck fuck.
[13044.02s -> 13044.42s]  Thank you.
[13045.05s -> 13046.65s]  I've wasted eight turns on this one.
[13050.72s -> 13051.22s]  Damn it.
[13051.98s -> 13053.18s]  Let's do one of these though.
[13071.23s -> 13072.83s]  I'm on a sonar meta right now.
[13072.83s -> 13075.03s]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
[13075.13s -> 13085.96s]  re re nice.
[13085.96s -> 13086.66s]  Nice.
[13089.05s -> 13089.35s]  Come on.
[13089.35s -> 13089.85s]  Give me something.
[13102.83s -> 13103.73s]  I know where you are now.
[13104.11s -> 13108.25s]  This is this is guaranteed all but lovely.
[13108.35s -> 13110.30s]  It's a good one to take down.
[13110.40s -> 13112.00s]  Now we have four over here.
[13112.00s -> 13116.26s]  So you placed a bomb up here did place a bomb up here.
[13116.36s -> 13119.90s]  But if we have three before that then it couldn't be here.
[13120.70s -> 13124.89s]  It would most likely have to have been four piece.
[13125.56s -> 13128.16s]  So this is guaranteed either way.
[13144.02s -> 13144.62s]  All right.
[13146.62s -> 13149.90s]  That happened to one of these.
[13151.45s -> 13151.95s]  All right.
[13153.45s -> 13156.35s]  Well, it's one of these two spaces because you just put a
[13156.35s -> 13157.45s]  bomb over here.
[13158.49s -> 13159.39s]  What could this even be?
[13167.08s -> 13167.68s]  That was stupid of me.
[13167.68s -> 13169.38s]  There's literally only one place I could have put the bomb.
[13170.48s -> 13171.48s]  But wait, hold on.
[13171.88s -> 13173.18s]  Could this just be it here?
[13173.48s -> 13173.98s]  I wonder.
[13189.08s -> 13189.48s]  Okay.
[13189.78s -> 13190.18s]  Fuck.
[13190.18s -> 13191.08s]  I gave it away.
[13191.08s -> 13191.68s]  I think I got you.
[13192.51s -> 13193.21s]  I think I got you here.
[13193.21s -> 13193.71s]  Hold on.
[13197.52s -> 13198.52s]  No, this could be anything.
[13198.52s -> 13199.32s]  This could be anything.
[13199.32s -> 13200.32s]  This could be your three.
[13200.32s -> 13201.02s]  This could be your two.
[13201.02s -> 13201.62s]  This could be anything.
[13203.95s -> 13204.35s]  Okay.
[13204.65s -> 13205.35s]  Is it the two?
[13205.45s -> 13205.85s]  Nope.
[13207.38s -> 13209.08s]  Now here's the tricky part though.
[13209.81s -> 13215.45s]  This could be your Tetris piece or could it not?
[13215.45s -> 13216.55s]  Is that I think this is your three.
[13219.66s -> 13221.06s]  Did you go this way or this way?
[13226.16s -> 13226.56s]  Mm-hmm.
[13228.31s -> 13232.01s]  The amount of stress I have right now is so unparalleled.
[13232.31s -> 13233.01s]  You went this way.
[13234.10s -> 13234.50s]  Okay.
[13235.50s -> 13235.90s]  Wait.
[13236.54s -> 13237.44s]  No, hold on.
[13237.54s -> 13239.04s]  I think this is your Tetris piece.
[13239.04s -> 13239.64s]  It's right here.
[13239.64s -> 13240.14s]  Isn't it?
[13240.84s -> 13241.34s]  Isn't it?
[13242.11s -> 13242.91s]  You can tell me.
[13243.21s -> 13244.81s]  My hair is crazy.
[13265.93s -> 13266.33s]  It is.
[13266.33s -> 13266.63s]  All right.
[13266.63s -> 13266.93s]  All right.
[13266.93s -> 13267.23s]  All right.
[13267.23s -> 13267.53s]  All right.
[13267.53s -> 13267.93s]  I got you.
[13268.03s -> 13268.43s]  I got you.
[13268.43s -> 13268.83s]  I got you.
[13268.83s -> 13269.23s]  I got you.
[13270.32s -> 13270.72s]  I got you.
[13270.72s -> 13271.02s]  Get me.
[13272.38s -> 13273.48s]  You did get me.
[13273.48s -> 13276.08s]  I'm now quite stressed.
[13277.61s -> 13279.31s]  You are in a good position though.
[13279.31s -> 13280.81s]  You've only you've got your two is.
[13281.61s -> 13282.81s]  Magically somewhere over here.
[13283.11s -> 13284.51s]  So let's see if I can do this.
[13291.50s -> 13291.90s]  Okay.
[13292.60s -> 13306.61s]  Shit really only one put your two right here.
[13318.24s -> 13318.94s]  That was the bomb.
[13318.94s -> 13320.14s]  There was three before.
[13321.61s -> 13323.11s]  There's a four piece remaining.
[13323.11s -> 13324.31s]  How are there three terrible?
[13324.31s -> 13325.71s]  Why people call me terrible one.
[13326.01s -> 13327.31s]  How are there three in here?
[13328.20s -> 13329.70s]  Did I I must have found two boats.
[13329.70s -> 13342.87s]  I must have pinged two boats because that's a two must
[13342.97s -> 13344.17s]  unless you put a bomb.
[13386.00s -> 13389.10s]  There was not a sound mind and Ludwig is taking advantage
[13389.10s -> 13389.60s]  of him.
[13390.30s -> 13391.00s]  What do you mean?
[13391.00s -> 13392.30s]  I thought that was stupid.
[13398.28s -> 13399.58s]  You just that was a lot of points.
[13400.88s -> 13403.18s]  Yeah, I think it's too late for the airstrike.
[13408.17s -> 13409.37s]  Where is this this?
[13409.37s -> 13415.09s]  Okay, this should have to be like over here.
[13424.62s -> 13427.22s]  I wonder if I wonder I wonder if it's down here.
[13429.83s -> 13432.93s]  On our and this is not maybe also not this one.
[13433.03s -> 13441.04s]  No, your two could just be anywhere.
[13441.04s -> 13441.74s]  That's the problem.
[13443.16s -> 13444.76s]  It could be anywhere.
[13444.76s -> 13450.26s]  Yeah, but the problem is if I'm gonna this I already hit
[13450.26s -> 13451.36s]  these two.
[13451.36s -> 13453.56s]  So I would realistically only be hitting like these three.
[13456.34s -> 13457.24s]  I'm going to sonar this one.
[13457.91s -> 13460.11s]  No, that's so no sonar this one.
[13462.71s -> 13463.51s]  Sonar this one.
[13463.51s -> 13467.45s]  No, I think I'm going to sonar this one.
[13467.55s -> 13468.55s]  I'm going for it bucket.
[13472.65s -> 13473.55s]  Oh bingo.
[13473.65s -> 13474.15s]  Okay.
[13474.92s -> 13478.22s]  So interestingly enough it ain't any of these ones.
[13481.03s -> 13481.83s]  Thank you down here.
[13489.28s -> 13489.78s]  All right.
[13490.08s -> 13492.58s]  Now is this the two or is this the Tetris piece?
[13513.56s -> 13514.56s]  What I do I fucked up.
[13514.66s -> 13515.26s]  How do I fuck up?
[13515.90s -> 13517.90s]  I thought there was a see you see he still has a two.
[13521.54s -> 13522.34s]  He still had a two.
[13561.66s -> 13564.06s]  If I think this through I might have it one.
[13564.16s -> 13564.66s]  Right here.
[13571.95s -> 13573.25s]  Is it right here?
[13575.52s -> 13578.72s]  Right because it has to be oh, this is a bomb.
[13578.82s -> 13581.72s]  This is either a bomb or it's right fucking here.
[13587.44s -> 13589.04s]  Well have it once bold you're so missing.
[13590.48s -> 13592.28s]  This is the sonar picks up bombs, right?
[13598.68s -> 13599.38s]  This is a bomb.
[13599.88s -> 13600.68s]  This is a bomb.
[13600.88s -> 13601.68s]  This is a bomb.
[13601.78s -> 13602.48s]  This is a bomb.
[13602.68s -> 13603.38s]  This is a bomb.
[13603.78s -> 13604.48s]  This is a bomb.
[13604.68s -> 13605.38s]  This is a bomb.
[13605.58s -> 13606.18s]  This is a bomb.
[13607.38s -> 13609.68s]  I fucking knew it was a bomb and I still clicked it.
[13613.21s -> 13614.01s]  Oh, no.
[13615.55s -> 13616.45s]  Oh, come on, please.
[13616.95s -> 13621.27s]  Oh, no.
[13621.27s -> 13622.47s]  That's fucking huge.
[13622.57s -> 13625.97s]  Yeah, how unlucky can you get?
[13627.54s -> 13628.84s]  Oh, that is so bad for me.
[13634.80s -> 13637.80s]  Oh, this is this is this is this is all down to this turn.
[13637.80s -> 13652.66s]  I think this is all just here we go.
[13653.52s -> 13654.52s]  Hmm.
[13654.82s -> 13655.22s]  Okay.
[13655.32s -> 13655.62s]  All right.
[13655.62s -> 13656.22s]  I need I need a win.
[13656.22s -> 13657.52s]  I need to win right now.
[13658.02s -> 13660.82s]  Now that this this this this has to be down.
[13660.82s -> 13717.10s]  It has to be oh, oh, I think there's only two possible locations.
[13717.10s -> 13720.72s]  No, I think there's only one.
[13722.92s -> 13726.11s]  I think it has to be here.
[13740.01s -> 13740.51s]  Jerma.
[13742.84s -> 13749.32s]  Oh, I will give you one last attempt.
[13749.42s -> 13751.52s]  What do we play another game?
[13752.09s -> 13754.31s]  No, that's not what I mean.
[13756.54s -> 13758.34s]  Wait, you're throwing on purpose.
[13758.34s -> 13765.37s]  I'm giving you one turn one turn one turn to save everything.
[13765.37s -> 13768.43s]  You cherish what a good luck.
[13768.43s -> 13769.43s]  What a good guy.
[13771.25s -> 13772.35s]  It's not going to be easy.
[13776.95s -> 13781.85s]  You have to guess right on which ship is where in what coordination
[13781.85s -> 13793.24s]  is it right here?
[13793.54s -> 13806.57s]  I'm going I'm going to the bottom right because if it's if it's
[13806.57s -> 13809.07s]  this is the I'll get good info, right?
[13809.07s -> 13809.97s]  This is info.
[13810.60s -> 13811.20s]  There's no info.
[13811.20s -> 13812.00s]  It's your last turn.
[13812.10s -> 13813.10s]  I know but this is info.
[13813.99s -> 13816.29s]  There's no oh unless you're doing like a major shot.
[13816.29s -> 13818.21s]  Yeah, that's this is info.
[13826.14s -> 13827.34s]  Oh, no, but you hit my thing.
[13827.44s -> 13838.58s]  What I got you.
[13838.58s -> 13838.98s]  I got you.
[13838.98s -> 13839.58s]  This is it.
[13839.58s -> 13843.38s]  I did it because you get me know because now all all the all
[13843.38s -> 13846.08s]  that's left is this is your Tetris piece, but which way is
[13846.08s -> 13846.78s]  it going?
[13846.98s -> 13847.98s]  Yeah, how do you know where it's going?
[13848.08s -> 13848.68s]  I don't know.
[13850.21s -> 13851.71s]  I have to sonar something.
[13851.71s -> 13853.11s]  I have to sonar this one here.
[13853.41s -> 13854.91s]  No, wait, take your time.
[13854.91s -> 13856.11s]  I don't want to mess with the cat.
[13858.07s -> 13859.47s]  So no this one or sonar this one.
[13863.41s -> 13864.61s]  I got a sonar the top right one.
[13868.83s -> 13870.33s]  This would be one two.
[13870.33s -> 13875.40s]  This would be three right or this one this one, right?
[13876.55s -> 13880.05s]  But this one because it was going down then it'd be one two.
[13880.55s -> 13883.65s]  It would be one if it was going this way if it was one two
[13883.65s -> 13884.35s]  bang bang.
[13884.55s -> 13888.14s]  That means this would just be one right.
[13892.94s -> 13893.64s]  That's that's this.
[13893.64s -> 13893.84s]  All right.
[13893.84s -> 13894.14s]  Here we go.
[13894.14s -> 13894.74s]  I'm going for it.
[13896.05s -> 13897.95s]  But could you flip it some weird way?
[13899.93s -> 13910.27s]  Oh, yeah, you can flip horizontally for what do you mean
[13910.27s -> 13918.58s]  for you have a bomb in every spot here.
[13918.98s -> 13923.56s]  It's one.
[13923.56s -> 13924.06s]  It's okay.
[13924.06s -> 13929.14s]  It's either one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four.
[13929.24s -> 13933.94s]  Oh my god bullet, but it has to be this one here has to has
[13933.94s -> 13937.94s]  to be guaranteed one below has to be this has to be it at
[13937.94s -> 13938.64s]  least this one.
[13939.64s -> 13940.64s]  It has to be.
[13941.14s -> 13944.98s]  At least it can't be a bomb here.
[13944.98s -> 13954.79s]  There's no way this would connect to anything but shit.
[13954.79s -> 13960.74s]  But what if it's these two as it could be this one in this
[13960.74s -> 13961.64s]  one, couldn't it?
[13964.69s -> 13966.29s]  Oh, no.
[13969.87s -> 13970.97s]  What would you have done?
[13972.83s -> 13974.53s]  I want you to trust yourself.
[13974.53s -> 13978.02s]  Maybe flip a coin, but you might have bombs here.
[13979.21s -> 13980.11s]  It could be one.
[13980.11s -> 13987.45s]  It could be bang bang or it could be just bang bang or or
[13987.45s -> 13988.25s]  it was rise.
[13989.17s -> 13989.97s]  Take a breath.
[13990.37s -> 13991.07s]  Take the shot.
[13993.40s -> 13994.60s]  I have a sonar here.
[13995.46s -> 13997.56s]  Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero.
[13997.56s -> 13998.06s]  I got you.
[13998.46s -> 13998.86s]  I got you.
[13998.86s -> 13999.36s]  I did it.
[14000.88s -> 14002.28s]  It's your zero IQ.
[14002.28s -> 14003.38s]  Gerber figured it out.
[14003.38s -> 14005.67s]  You're like God, right?
[14005.97s -> 14011.99s]  I'm so I don't know one, two, hold on zero, zero, zero,
[14011.99s -> 14013.89s]  zero, zero, zero, zero, zero.
[14014.09s -> 14015.39s]  So it has to be this one.
[14029.50s -> 14031.70s]  Thank you dad for letting me play the game.
[14032.20s -> 14037.60s]  Hey, look, I can't take $1,500 a catboy three tweets for
[14037.70s -> 14040.80s]  exclamation point seven houses on our first time hanging out.
[14040.80s -> 14041.80s]  That's that's too much.
[14041.80s -> 14042.00s]  All right.
[14042.00s -> 14043.60s]  We got to got to draw the line somewhere.
[14044.53s -> 14046.33s]  So what do I actually have to do now?
[14047.27s -> 14049.77s]  You owe one tweet, huh?
[14050.27s -> 14054.47s]  Where you are delivering almond milk in a mega milk costume.
[14054.57s -> 14055.07s]  Oh fuck.
[14055.07s -> 14056.07s]  That sucks.
[14056.47s -> 14058.37s]  And you also have to wear that on stream.
[14058.77s -> 14059.87s]  Oh, that sucks too.
[14060.60s -> 14067.98s]  And then you have to put I think $1,500 on a black at a
[14067.98s -> 14068.78s]  roulette table.
[14068.78s -> 14069.08s]  Oh my God.
[14069.08s -> 14069.88s]  That sucks.
[14070.18s -> 14070.98s]  I yeah.
[14071.48s -> 14071.88s]  Yeah.
[14071.88s -> 14074.38s]  So, you know today, what happened here?
[14077.19s -> 14080.29s]  So I don't I don't feel to the alternative would have just
[14080.29s -> 14081.29s]  the only thing you've won.
[14081.29s -> 14084.29s]  There is the removal of cat which which I feel I feel okay
[14084.29s -> 14084.69s]  with that.
[14084.69s -> 14085.19s]  Excuse me.
[14085.19s -> 14088.46s]  And like 70 bucks, 80 bucks, whatever it was.
[14088.96s -> 14089.46s]  That's true.
[14089.46s -> 14091.76s]  You did also win 80 bucks that you didn't wait.
[14091.76s -> 14092.96s]  What was how many subs of it?
[14093.44s -> 14094.54s]  Well, no, the subs are removed.
[14094.54s -> 14097.84s]  The subs are replaced with that with that with the with the
[14097.84s -> 14099.64s]  with the wager for the roulette.
[14100.14s -> 14100.94s]  So zero subs.
[14101.67s -> 14103.27s]  Wait, I thought I got no, no, it wasn't subs.
[14103.27s -> 14104.47s]  It was dollars, right?
[14104.87s -> 14110.08s]  $50 it was 96 subs and then it's been translated to the
[14110.08s -> 14110.98s]  casino bet.
[14111.08s -> 14111.88s]  Oh, okay.
[14112.08s -> 14113.38s]  So just give me a list of things.
[14113.38s -> 14116.08s]  I have to do I'll do I'll just I'll send you the list of
[14116.08s -> 14116.68s]  errands.
[14118.98s -> 14119.98s]  Look Ludwig.
[14119.98s -> 14120.88s]  What a hero.
[14120.88s -> 14122.88s]  What a streamer hero for me.
[14123.81s -> 14126.81s]  Yeah, let me tell you I've made enemies in both of our chats
[14126.81s -> 14127.31s]  from that.
[14128.41s -> 14129.61s]  Hey, but here's the thing though.
[14130.71s -> 14133.11s]  I could have really I could have fucked that up big time.
[14133.21s -> 14134.91s]  You could have easily fucked that up easily.
[14135.78s -> 14138.38s]  I think that that that explosion explosion you place in
[14138.38s -> 14139.98s]  the bottom right was that was a good explosion.
[14140.38s -> 14142.78s]  Because you could have decided to have placed that in the
[14142.78s -> 14144.78s]  top and that would have that would have been much tougher.
[14146.14s -> 14147.44s]  Well, that was fucking a lot of fun.
[14148.21s -> 14149.01s]  Yeah, I had a blast.
[14149.01s -> 14149.61s]  I had a blast.
[14149.61s -> 14150.71s]  Thanks for playing games.
[14150.71s -> 14152.31s]  I did not think we were going to do this for four hours,
[14152.31s -> 14153.11s]  but we did know.
[14153.11s -> 14155.11s]  Yeah, we were like we should get a list of games because
[14155.11s -> 14156.51s]  we're probably going to get a little bored.
[14159.16s -> 14160.16s]  No, absolutely not.
[14160.16s -> 14162.96s]  That was yeah, that was a pleasure and I'm glad you had
[14163.06s -> 14167.06s]  fun because even though I feel like we're leaving on a
[14167.06s -> 14170.86s]  note as if you had won you lost so much.
[14170.86s -> 14173.66s]  I very much lost a shitload.
[14174.26s -> 14177.54s]  Yeah, but I won the first like three games got really
[14177.54s -> 14179.94s]  overconfident and then lost five or six in a row.
[14180.24s -> 14184.44s]  It did feel for some reason like it was easier for me.
[14184.44s -> 14184.74s]  I don't know.
[14184.74s -> 14186.64s]  I think you just psych yourself out because even at the
[14186.64s -> 14189.14s]  end like it was mathematically proven with the sonar.
[14189.34s -> 14193.04s]  Yeah, I think just the stress your brain just melted.
[14193.44s -> 14198.12s]  Yeah, it does that but that was great.
[14198.12s -> 14201.42s]  That was a pleasure and I'll see you again Tuesday.
[14201.62s -> 14202.12s]  That's right.
[14202.12s -> 14205.02s]  I didn't even tell anybody I had nobody even knows what's
[14205.02s -> 14205.82s]  happening on Tuesday.
[14205.82s -> 14207.62s]  It is the first time I've streamed since last week.
[14208.02s -> 14208.42s]  Oh really?
[14208.42s -> 14210.12s]  Yeah, they don't know I've told my chat.
[14210.22s -> 14211.42s]  I don't think you've told your chat.
[14211.42s -> 14212.72s]  Would you like to go ahead and tell them what's going
[14212.72s -> 14213.42s]  to happen on Tuesday?
[14213.42s -> 14216.52s]  Oh, yeah, you want my words not your I can do my words.
[14216.52s -> 14218.02s]  Yeah, but if you do your event.
[14218.56s -> 14223.16s]  Yeah, this this Tuesday, I put $5,000 on the line for
[14223.16s -> 14226.46s]  a 12 streamer Mario Kart tournament.
[14226.96s -> 14229.26s]  It's going to be about two hours starting at 6 p.m.
[14229.26s -> 14232.86s]  Pacific and it features myself.
[14232.86s -> 14236.16s]  Jerma cutie Connor simply ms.
[14236.16s -> 14240.96s]  Kiff Clint mango XQC Northern Lion moist critical and in
[14240.96s -> 14241.96s]  a mystery guest meaning.
[14241.96s -> 14246.08s]  I just I haven't filled a slot yet, but but that's it.
[14246.08s -> 14247.08s]  That's that's this Tuesday.
[14247.08s -> 14249.08s]  It's a mar the switch Mario Kart.
[14249.38s -> 14250.68s]  It is the switch Mario Kart.
[14250.68s -> 14253.18s]  So you'll need a you'll need that game and to capture it
[14253.18s -> 14254.78s]  which I think you you got that already, right?
[14254.78s -> 14254.98s]  Yeah.
[14254.98s -> 14255.48s]  Yeah, I got it.
[14256.86s -> 14258.76s]  But yeah, that's that's that's Tuesday at 6.
[14258.76s -> 14263.19s]  It should be like a about a two hour session and then
[14263.49s -> 14264.39s]  then there'll be winners.
[14264.59s -> 14266.09s]  Yeah, I'm I'm ready to go.
[14266.09s -> 14267.99s]  I'm actually not very I'm not bad at that game.
[14268.88s -> 14270.78s]  I am pretty bad.
[14270.78s -> 14273.78s]  So I don't expect myself to place well, but I think the
[14273.78s -> 14276.96s]  the favorites going in are definitely Clint and Northern
[14276.96s -> 14279.76s]  Lion because all that man does is just win shit just wins.
[14279.76s -> 14281.36s]  He just he just wins things.
[14281.36s -> 14282.06s]  That's what he does.
[14282.46s -> 14283.16s]  He's a winner.
[14283.16s -> 14285.96s]  He's a winner in a in a bald man's body.
[14287.23s -> 14291.16s]  Hey, what was we talking about like, you know, just he's
[14291.16s -> 14293.71s]  a winner, but he took one out.
[14293.71s -> 14296.74s]  He just thought that you I mean your hair is looking great.
[14296.74s -> 14299.28s]  Like you're not on your I'm kidding.
[14299.28s -> 14300.28s]  I'm gonna know man.
[14300.28s -> 14300.58s]  It's good.
[14300.58s -> 14300.98s]  It's good.
[14300.98s -> 14301.78s]  I'm it's happening.
[14301.98s -> 14302.88s]  I'll be balded for you.
[14303.78s -> 14306.28s]  Do you think if it if you feel like it's coming you take
[14306.28s -> 14306.88s]  Propecia?
[14307.28s -> 14311.97s]  No, I'll just drink some extra green tea and I eat somebody
[14311.97s -> 14312.87s]  have some fish oil and shit.
[14312.87s -> 14313.37s]  You'll be fine.
[14313.87s -> 14315.37s]  Yeah, me.
[14315.37s -> 14317.67s]  I would have a existential crisis when it's coming because
[14317.67s -> 14318.67s]  both my grandparents are bald.
[14318.67s -> 14319.37s]  It is coming.
[14319.67s -> 14320.17s]  I know me too.
[14321.87s -> 14323.47s]  It's gonna happen in like the next probably three or four
[14323.47s -> 14323.87s]  years.
[14324.27s -> 14325.17s]  I'm gonna be 40.
[14325.17s -> 14326.97s]  I'll be 40 in like less than five years guys.
[14326.97s -> 14327.57s]  What are you talking about?
[14327.57s -> 14329.87s]  Yeah, five years is a long time.
[14329.87s -> 14330.47s]  All right.
[14330.47s -> 14334.37s]  And look, you know, this is 40 40 year old Virgin.
[14334.37s -> 14335.47s]  It's that's a hot year.
[14335.47s -> 14336.47s]  People like that year.
[14340.31s -> 14340.91s]  Excuse me.
[14341.31s -> 14341.91s]  What do you wrote?
[14342.21s -> 14342.71s]  Excuse me.
[14344.70s -> 14345.00s]  Yeah.
[14345.00s -> 14345.90s]  Yes 40.
[14348.04s -> 14349.84s]  You just call me a virgin.
[14350.54s -> 14352.84s]  No, I'm saying that like it's a popular like, you know,
[14352.84s -> 14355.54s]  how like when you turn 22, you're like, oh Taylor
[14356.04s -> 14357.64s]  I'm feeling 22 40.
[14357.64s -> 14360.54s]  It has so many exciting things that come along with it.
[14360.54s -> 14364.04s]  Like the movie the 40 year old Virgin is it omen to 40
[14364.04s -> 14370.82s]  year olds or who are virgins with the movies about it's
[14370.82s -> 14371.52s]  a footnote.
[14371.52s -> 14372.22s]  It's a footnote.
[14372.22s -> 14375.72s]  It's more so I think Virgin comes up 2000 times in the
[14375.72s -> 14376.22s]  script.
[14376.72s -> 14380.52s]  It's mostly just a vehicle for talking about the beauty
[14380.52s -> 14383.72s]  of aging more so than about virginity, which is which
[14383.72s -> 14384.52s]  is a beautiful thing.
[14384.52s -> 14385.62s]  And it's in its own, right?
[14386.12s -> 14388.58s]  For virginity.
[14391.19s -> 14391.79s]  All right, man.
[14391.99s -> 14393.09s]  It's been a fucking pleasure.
[14393.49s -> 14395.79s]  This is the first time we ever like hung out on stream.
[14396.29s -> 14397.29s]  Yeah, it's a blast.
[14397.39s -> 14400.49s]  And and now we've definitely set up one more hangout
[14400.49s -> 14402.69s]  and at some point I'm going to knock on your door
[14402.69s -> 14405.59s]  with far too expensive bidet for your asshole.
[14405.59s -> 14407.89s]  I can't wait to spray water into my ass.
[14410.03s -> 14410.63s]  It'll be clipped.
[14412.82s -> 14413.72s]  Not live though.
[14413.92s -> 14414.92s]  Oh God.
[14415.32s -> 14415.92s]  Oh God.
[14416.32s -> 14417.62s]  Yeah, I'll see you on Tuesday.
[14418.12s -> 14418.42s]  But all right.
[14418.42s -> 14418.92s]  Yeah, I'll see you.
[14418.92s -> 14419.22s]  I'll see you.
[14419.22s -> 14419.92s]  Have a good rest of your day.
[14420.02s -> 14420.82s]  Yeah, take care man.
[14420.82s -> 14421.32s]  Thanks for playing.
[14421.92s -> 14422.12s]  All right.
[14422.12s -> 14422.22s]  Bye.
[14422.22s -> 14422.42s]  Bye.
[14424.66s -> 14425.26s]  That was a lot of fun.
[14428.08s -> 14429.98s]  Yeah, when we first turned the stream on we were like,
[14429.98s -> 14431.88s]  oh yeah, maybe we'll play like Battleship for like,
[14431.88s -> 14432.08s]  I don't know.
[14432.08s -> 14433.18s]  We like 40 minutes.
[14434.28s -> 14436.58s]  We like 30 minutes maybe a tops.
[14437.08s -> 14437.88s]  That was a lot of fun.
[14440.70s -> 14441.70s]  Have to do a bunch of stuff.
[14441.70s -> 14442.90s]  Why does it always end up like this?
[14444.06s -> 14446.06s]  Anytime this competition I always like end up like
[14446.16s -> 14453.19s]  dressing up in a costume that happens every time I'll
[14453.19s -> 14454.99s]  figure out what the what how those tweets are going
[14454.99s -> 14455.49s]  to happen.
[14456.19s -> 14458.19s]  I have to like he's got to get this shirt.
[14458.19s -> 14459.89s]  If that's the shirt you want we got we got some
[14459.89s -> 14463.35s]  stuff to do but that's a perfect opportunity for me
[14463.35s -> 14463.75s]  to stop.
[14464.74s -> 14466.64s]  That was Ludwig if you don't know.
[14466.64s -> 14468.64s]  I mean, how could you not know Ludwig at this point?
[14469.73s -> 14474.01s]  He's hilarious fucking top 10 streamer.
[14474.01s -> 14476.51s]  He's probably probably in my top five at least of all
[14476.51s -> 14479.20s]  streamers will follow him if you don't which I don't
[14479.20s -> 14485.61s]  know how you don't but yeah, well, I'll see you guys
[14485.61s -> 14486.21s]  on Tuesday.
[14486.21s -> 14487.11s]  I'll be streaming on Tuesday.
[14487.51s -> 14489.21s]  I'll probably be streaming my perspective from the
[14489.21s -> 14490.31s]  Mario Kart Tournament.
[14491.28s -> 14493.28s]  I have some practicing to do so I'm going to be
[14493.28s -> 14496.78s]  streaming because I haven't I don't never streamed
[14496.78s -> 14497.48s]  Mario Kart.
[14498.08s -> 14499.08s]  So we'll see how that goes.
[14499.38s -> 14506.51s]  I need practice but is Ludwig still going to stream
[14506.51s -> 14515.91s]  or is he ending I think we're ending right?
[14522.70s -> 14523.20s]  That was a lot of fun.
[14523.20s -> 14523.70s]  Yeah, it was.
[14527.72s -> 14528.62s]  Thank you for the subs by the way.
[14528.62s -> 14530.72s]  I didn't really pay I would kind of locked in my
[14530.72s -> 14536.12s]  brain was kind of locked in to you know, everything
[14536.12s -> 14537.12s]  that going on on the screen.

[14562.71s -> 14563.41s]  go raid Joel.
[14563.71s -> 14564.61s]  He's playing Noita.
[14567.27s -> 14570.20s]  Oh, we all know how that's that's a no.
[14570.20s -> 14571.60s]  That's a notorious stream here.
[14573.90s -> 14575.10s]  Go say hello to Joel.
[14575.40s -> 14579.52s]  Barg Skelethor if you don't know he's a very very

[14594.17s -> 14594.87s]  tag on Twitch.
[14594.87s -> 14596.47s]  Yeah, what the fuck is going on there?
[14598.08s -> 14600.58s]  I feel like we gave that just enough attention to
[14600.58s -> 14601.28s]  be confused.
[14607.61s -> 14609.11s]  Let's get the raid going.
[14612.86s -> 14613.26s]  Goodbye.
[14613.26s -> 14613.76s]  Good night.

[14617.26s -> 14618.46s]  Bye stinking man.
