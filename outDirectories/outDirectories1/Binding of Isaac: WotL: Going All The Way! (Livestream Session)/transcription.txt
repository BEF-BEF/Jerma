[2.04s -> 11.82s]  Okay, so guys, welcome to Binding of Isaac, my playthrough, or my first one, I guess.
[11.82s -> 18.97s]  Ooh, I got the eye, the pinky eye. I forget what this thing does.
[22.98s -> 27.68s]  TF2 would not work. I couldn't get it to- I couldn't stream it for some reason.
[28.18s -> 31.38s]  It was all laggy and glitchy and crazy, and I couldn't do anything about it.
[31.70s -> 37.06s]  I'm gonna have to figure out why that's happening, because that's not good at all.
[37.86s -> 45.38s]  Not at all. You have nothing for me. I didn't really find anything besides the
[48.06s -> 53.03s]  chance to do poison. That's pretty sick. I don't have any bombs or anything. Looks like we're just gonna go fight the boss.
[53.67s -> 57.14s]  Kane versus Pin. All right, Pin, what you got?
[58.02s -> 66.45s]  You ain't got nothing on me, buddy. I see the one that just kind of jumps out. It's, uh, it's that agreement right there. Cool.
[66.45s -> 67.85s]  Cool, cool, cool.
[67.85s -> 71.37s]  Bully!
[71.37s -> 72.57s]  Ow!
[72.57s -> 79.88s]  No, I wish Burger Boy was in this game as a playable character.
[80.44s -> 84.10s]  Whoa!
[84.10s -> 90.31s]  Why am I not hitting him?
[90.43s -> 92.31s]  He just killed himself.
[92.31s -> 95.45s]  What a stupid bastard.
[96.76s -> 100.06s]  Ding ding, ding ding, ding ding ding ding ding, let's go.
[100.26s -> 107.34s]  The basement, too.
[108.06s -> 116.22s]  You know, how I'm not playing as Isaac? So I don't have the bomb, the luxury of having like, the bombs.
[117.00s -> 129.53s]  Get out of here. Get out of here! Boop boop boop. Actually, I gotta plug my headphones in. That's one thing I didn't do.
[130.39s -> 139.66s]  Headphones, you're in. And, oh, are you sure you want to do this? Yes, I'm sure. I'm as sure as I'm gonna be.
[140.36s -> 145.42s]  Aren't I? Let's go!
[145.42s -> 156.15s]  How do you record games with fraps? F9, I think, is by default.
[156.15s -> 166.04s]  The Book of Shadows, I love this thing. This gives you a shield when you hit space.
[166.04s -> 180.02s]  Any bombs? Envy! Oh, Envy.
[180.02s -> 187.27s]  Envy's got nothing on me. Envy's got nothing on you.
[187.27s -> 192.75s]  Oh, and for future reference, if you're watching this on YouTube,
[192.75s -> 197.75s]  and I'm responding to random questions on the stream.
[199.56s -> 202.56s]  So I'm not talking to Burger Boy, or he's not here with me.
[202.56s -> 204.56s]  Otto's not in the room with me.
[204.56s -> 208.56s]  So, Otto, what do you think about fraps, like in F9?
[208.56s -> 219.12s]  This is Wrath of the Lamb. Wrath of the Lamb DLC.
[219.12s -> 226.08s]  Excuse me, sir.
[227.08s -> 229.39s]  I love the noise those guys make.
[234.98s -> 238.98s]  TF2 is not going to start, unfortunately.
[238.98s -> 245.98s]  I have to do some bug fixes, or find out why the stream was lagging, like, incredibly.
[245.98s -> 250.28s]  X-Split, it was X-Split. I have no idea why.
[250.28s -> 252.28s]  It's something I have to spend some time with.
[252.28s -> 257.61s]  Question is, actually, can I put the Book of Shadows on and walk in here?
[257.61s -> 260.17s]  I bet I can, let's find out.
[260.17s -> 264.86s]  Oh, absolutely I can. Oh, baby, look at that.
[264.86s -> 267.86s]  And pills, I'm Kane, taking the pills would be good.
[268.86s -> 270.86s]  Tears up, hell yeah.
[270.86s -> 273.04s]  And what's this going to be?
[273.04s -> 276.04s]  Health up. Look, and you know what? I'm going to get hurt right here.
[276.04s -> 289.94s]  It was worth it. Totally worth it. Totally worth it.
[289.94s -> 294.82s]  Yeah, the YouTube chat is not really ideal.
[294.82s -> 300.82s]  When you write a message, let's say like five people write a message at the same time,
[300.82s -> 305.82s]  it kind of puts everything in a queue, and spams it after like two minutes.
[305.82s -> 313.50s]  It's very weird.
[314.50s -> 316.50s]  Da da da da da.
[320.96s -> 322.96s]  Secret room, baby.
[322.96s -> 324.96s]  Oh, that's a dime. That's a dime.
[324.96s -> 329.88s]  Okay, now I'm going to go in the coin room.
[329.88s -> 337.31s]  Going in that coin room.
[337.31s -> 339.48s]  Let's see.
[339.48s -> 343.62s]  Alright, this is a bunch of pills, I think, isn't it?
[343.62s -> 345.86s]  That's the coin purse.
[345.86s -> 350.02s]  I think that's the coin purse.
[350.02s -> 352.02s]  Yup, oh my god, and look at this.
[352.02s -> 355.02s]  I'm going to buy these pills over here, too.
[355.02s -> 357.84s]  This is going to be insane.
[357.84s -> 360.27s]  Bombs are key.
[360.27s -> 363.83s]  What's this one? Health up. Health up again.
[363.83s -> 366.07s]  Oh my god.
[366.07s -> 368.07s]  What is this?
[368.07s -> 370.07s]  Balls. Look at this, guys.
[370.07s -> 372.07s]  And I'm going to buy this, too.
[372.07s -> 374.07s]  Whatever this is, it's going to be good.
[374.07s -> 376.07s]  Oh, we're going to be teleport pills.
[376.07s -> 380.07s]  Yeah, Kane, if you have any pills when you're playing with Kane,
[380.07s -> 382.07s]  then you'll never get bad pills, ever.
[382.07s -> 385.14s]  There's health in that room, I want it.
[385.14s -> 387.14s]  And I want this, too.
[387.14s -> 390.34s]  What? What just happened?
[390.34s -> 393.33s]  What the hell was that?
[393.33s -> 395.33s]  Alright, I just put a bomb down right here,
[395.33s -> 398.33s]  moved over and put up, and then looked over at the chat,
[398.33s -> 400.33s]  and then I got hurt.
[400.33s -> 402.33s]  What just happened?
[402.33s -> 404.33s]  Did the bomb come up with me? Did the fly hit it?
[404.33s -> 406.70s]  What the hell was that?
[406.70s -> 409.90s]  Oh.
[409.90s -> 411.90s]  I looked over at the chat, like, what are people saying?
[411.90s -> 415.16s]  Dang, I get hurt.
[415.16s -> 417.16s]  I wanted to open this. Oh.
[417.16s -> 421.82s]  Come on, now.
[421.82s -> 423.82s]  The reason why I'm not streaming on Twitch anymore
[423.82s -> 426.82s]  is because I get 720 on YouTube.
[426.82s -> 429.25s]  I'm not partnered on Twitch.
[429.25s -> 433.48s]  Because I have a contract with Machinima
[433.48s -> 437.48s]  that makes it so I can stream on here.
[437.48s -> 440.42s]  I can't believe I didn't get that.
[440.42s -> 444.90s]  I can't believe I did not get that item.
[444.90s -> 448.61s]  I'm an idiot.
[448.61s -> 451.88s]  Get away from me.
[451.88s -> 453.88s]  Alright, so it looks like we got some fruit punch right here,
[453.88s -> 456.88s]  some Hi-C ecto cooler.
[456.88s -> 459.88s]  If anyone knows what that is, you get plus 20 German points.
[459.88s -> 464.10s]  Yeah, that right there,
[464.10s -> 466.10s]  that green stuff right here is ecto cooler.
[466.10s -> 468.10s]  Hi-C ecto cooler.
[468.10s -> 470.40s]  The rest is fruit punch.
[470.40s -> 476.72s]  Let's keep going.
[476.72s -> 482.04s]  Pinkie eye.
[482.04s -> 484.04s]  Oh, God.
[484.04s -> 486.04s]  Why do they have to have such big tears?
[486.04s -> 490.07s]  Okay, I got the book of shadow again.
[490.07s -> 494.48s]  I got the book of shadows.
[494.48s -> 500.12s]  I need bombs.
[500.12s -> 503.51s]  I need bombs bad.
[503.51s -> 507.03s]  Get away from me.
[507.03s -> 516.48s]  A nickel.
[516.48s -> 518.48s]  These guys can't do anything.
[518.48s -> 520.48s]  I don't want to get myself hurt.
[520.48s -> 522.98s]  Curve the bullet like in wanted.
[522.98s -> 525.16s]  Oh, come on.
[525.16s -> 527.40s]  You're better than this, Jerma.
[527.40s -> 529.40s]  I miss you every single time.
[529.40s -> 533.09s]  Oh, God.
[533.09s -> 535.09s]  Where's Boo?
[535.09s -> 537.33s]  Boo.
[537.33s -> 539.33s]  BooMan61 is my binding of Isaac.
[539.33s -> 542.53s]  My binding of Isaac buddy.
[542.53s -> 544.53s]  He tells me all these things I need to know.
[544.53s -> 550.16s]  Pinkie eye or match stick?
[550.16s -> 557.01s]  I think I'm going to stick with pinkie eye.
[557.01s -> 559.01s]  So wait, the 720 stream is bad?
[559.01s -> 561.01s]  Is that what you guys are saying?
[561.01s -> 563.19s]  The 720p stream is not good?
[563.19s -> 565.62s]  That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
[565.62s -> 567.62s]  I don't understand why.
[567.62s -> 570.69s]  Whole lot of weird stuff going on in today's stream.
[570.69s -> 572.69s]  I don't know what's going on here.
[572.69s -> 576.60s]  Boom.
[576.60s -> 579.59s]  Yeah, you got nothing, Sloth.
[579.59s -> 581.59s]  Sorry, Sloth.
[581.59s -> 584.85s]  But you dead.
[584.85s -> 592.90s]  Favorite class in TF2 is the engineer.
[592.90s -> 594.90s]  Yeah, I just want...
[594.90s -> 598.10s]  No, I don't want that.
[598.10s -> 600.10s]  The book of shadows, because the book of shadows is really good.
[600.10s -> 603.68s]  I got my fly buddy
[603.68s -> 605.68s]  flying with me.
[605.68s -> 607.68s]  He's going to bend the knee and...
[607.68s -> 609.68s]  Wait, where is he? Oh, yeah, that's right.
[609.68s -> 611.68s]  He comes out randomly when I shoot people.
[611.68s -> 615.97s]  That's an amazing item, by the way.
[615.97s -> 617.97s]  Me and my fly
[617.97s -> 620.53s]  going to fly away
[620.53s -> 624.05s]  to the end of time.
[624.05s -> 626.05s]  Oh, no, mini greens. Book of shadows.
[626.05s -> 628.05s]  I had to. I'm not losing all my money.
[628.05s -> 630.68s]  These guys are shooting at me.
[630.68s -> 632.68s]  Get out of my face.
[632.68s -> 638.36s]  Ha ha.
[638.36s -> 640.36s]  Well, the resolution has nothing to do with
[640.36s -> 642.36s]  the chat.
[642.36s -> 644.36s]  It's just the YouTube chat is
[644.36s -> 646.36s]  bad.
[646.36s -> 648.36s]  I'm not going to sugarcoat it.
[648.36s -> 650.36s]  The YouTube streaming chat
[650.36s -> 657.38s]  is not so good.
[657.38s -> 664.74s]  Ugh.
[664.74s -> 666.74s]  I hate these enemies. When you get in a room with these guys
[666.74s -> 668.74s]  and there's more than three or four of them,
[668.74s -> 670.74s]  say your prayers,
[670.74s -> 673.11s]  because they are so annoying.
[673.11s -> 676.95s]  I don't have any money.
[676.95s -> 678.95s]  Test tomorrow, dude. I forget your name.
[678.95s -> 680.95s]  I went by way too fast.
[680.95s -> 682.95s]  Good luck on your test. Anybody who has a test.
[682.95s -> 684.95s]  Good luck on your finals.
[684.95s -> 686.95s]  If you already had them, I hope you aced them.
[686.95s -> 688.95s]  And if you haven't had them yet, then
[688.95s -> 690.95s]  go in there and sack them silly.
[690.95s -> 693.64s]  Metaphorically.
[693.64s -> 698.56s]  I'm going in here.
[698.56s -> 701.76s]  Get me some items.
[701.76s -> 703.76s]  Ooh.
[703.76s -> 705.76s]  Oh, big problem.
[705.76s -> 707.76s]  Oh, big problem.
[707.76s -> 709.76s]  Triple shot, baby.
[709.76s -> 711.76s]  I killed plenty of birds.
[711.76s -> 714.84s]  Look at that.
[714.84s -> 716.84s]  This could be a good playthrough
[716.84s -> 721.06s]  if I'm not an idiot.
[721.06s -> 723.06s]  Oh, like that.
[723.06s -> 725.06s]  I thought I could hide behind the thing and move.
[725.06s -> 729.99s]  But there was a rock in front of me.
[729.99s -> 731.99s]  I need to open this.
[731.99s -> 734.29s]  There might be hearts in there.
[734.29s -> 739.60s]  I need to.
[739.60s -> 751.00s]  No, but there's a nickel.
[751.00s -> 753.00s]  Across the pond in Wales. That's a far away.
[753.00s -> 755.00s]  That's a far away away.
[755.00s -> 758.26s]  Ooh, the battery.
[758.26s -> 760.95s]  Look at it out of my head. How gruesome.
[760.95s -> 762.95s]  Alright, I got a lot of good items,
[762.95s -> 764.95s]  but not a whole lot of health right now.
[764.95s -> 766.95s]  I cannot screw this up.
[766.95s -> 768.95s]  I really need to, like, pay attention and not die.
[768.95s -> 770.95s]  Because that would be so bad.
[770.95s -> 775.17s]  Alright, I got everything I need.
[775.17s -> 777.67s]  Can't get to the secret room.
[777.67s -> 779.84s]  I don't have any bombs.
[779.84s -> 781.84s]  I am not going to do TF2 again today.
[781.84s -> 783.84s]  Because it's just...
[783.84s -> 785.84s]  I don't want to have to do the headache.
[785.84s -> 788.72s]  I'll have to try and test it out later.
[788.72s -> 792.18s]  Alright, husk.
[792.18s -> 794.18s]  This is not going to be easy.
[794.18s -> 797.57s]  Try hard mode.
[797.57s -> 800.39s]  Have to, like, pay attention to only the game.
[800.39s -> 802.39s]  Just for fun, I'm turning it on.
[802.39s -> 805.27s]  I don't want a chance to bump right into him.
[805.27s -> 807.57s]  Come on, bump across, baby.
[807.57s -> 813.20s]  Alright, we're good to go.
[813.20s -> 817.54s]  What is this? Eight ball?
[817.54s -> 819.54s]  Oh.
[819.54s -> 821.54s]  It gave me, like, a rag on my head.
[821.54s -> 824.55s]  What the hell?
[824.55s -> 828.13s]  I am the magician.
[828.13s -> 830.13s]  Alright, doesn't the magician take you to the secret room?
[830.13s -> 832.13s]  No, he doesn't.
[832.13s -> 836.10s]  No, he doesn't.
[836.10s -> 838.10s]  This game is not free.
[838.10s -> 843.91s]  It's pretty cheap, though.
[843.91s -> 845.91s]  This game is only
[845.91s -> 847.91s]  five dollars on Steam.
[847.91s -> 850.85s]  Actually, isn't there a sale going on for it right now?
[850.85s -> 856.48s]  Or is the sale over?
[856.48s -> 858.48s]  Yeah, the no damage achievements, I don't know, man.
[858.48s -> 860.48s]  I don't think I could ever get those.
[860.48s -> 863.68s]  Because you'll get so confident,
[863.68s -> 865.68s]  you'll get to the end of a level and be like,
[865.68s -> 867.68s]  I got this in the bag.
[867.68s -> 870.12s]  And then you just die.
[870.12s -> 872.12s]  Oh my god, I got rage now.
[872.12s -> 874.61s]  As long as I play this safe,
[874.61s -> 876.61s]  I will beat this whole game right now.
[876.61s -> 880.71s]  I can't be stupid about this, though.
[880.71s -> 882.71s]  I gotta be smart. I gotta be smooth.
[882.71s -> 885.78s]  Oh, god.
[885.78s -> 890.58s]  The liberty cap is a random
[890.58s -> 892.95s]  mushroom
[892.95s -> 894.95s]  every room.
[894.95s -> 896.95s]  And this is a chance to have poison.
[896.95s -> 898.95s]  I think I'm gonna stick with the mushroom, guys.
[898.95s -> 900.95s]  Because I want those random mushroom achievement thingies.
[900.95s -> 908.63s]  Achievement, what am I talking about?
[908.63s -> 910.63s]  Yeah, I see I got a massive, like, speed increase now.
[910.63s -> 912.63s]  And, like, I'm kinda just little.
[912.63s -> 915.00s]  Is my mind playing a trick on me?
[915.00s -> 917.62s]  Or is this just damage?
[917.62s -> 923.06s]  I think it's just damage. I'm not going in there.
[923.06s -> 927.09s]  Screw that.
[927.09s -> 929.09s]  Exam tips? Well, good luck on your exams.
[929.09s -> 931.09s]  I actually made an exam tip video.
[931.09s -> 933.52s]  Did you, uh,
[933.52s -> 935.52s]  did you check that out?
[935.52s -> 937.52s]  Look at how little I am.
[937.52s -> 940.53s]  Hey, look, I'm tiny.
[940.53s -> 942.53s]  Get away from me.
[942.53s -> 945.92s]  There we go.
[945.92s -> 950.21s]  That's what I'm talking about.
[950.21s -> 952.21s]  It was a spy video from, I think, like a month ago.
[952.21s -> 955.73s]  How you see damage? I wish you could see damage in this game.
[955.73s -> 957.73s]  It'd be an interesting feature.
[957.73s -> 960.87s]  Little numbers popping up over everybody's heads.
[960.87s -> 965.67s]  Oh, what's that?
[965.67s -> 967.67s]  What's that do? I don't know.
[967.67s -> 970.29s]  Whatever. I don't want it. Pride.
[970.29s -> 974.77s]  Get away from me, Pride.
[974.77s -> 976.77s]  Get away from me, Pride.
[976.77s -> 979.91s]  Oh!
[979.91s -> 981.91s]  He's doing it too often.
[981.91s -> 983.91s]  I can't, will you do the other move?
[983.91s -> 987.17s]  Wow, he didn't do the
[987.17s -> 989.17s]  he didn't do the other move once.
[989.17s -> 991.54s]  What a son of a bastard.
[991.54s -> 994.74s]  I forget what the Emperor card does.
[994.74s -> 996.74s]  Boo! Boo!
[996.74s -> 1000.84s]  I need your help, Boo!
[1000.84s -> 1002.84s]  Anytime I'm in a Skype call with Boo, I'll just say an item
[1002.84s -> 1004.84s]  and he'll go
[1004.84s -> 1006.84s]  Oh, that does
[1006.84s -> 1008.84s]  plus 25 damage.
[1008.84s -> 1012.48s]  And I'll go, thanks, Boo.
[1012.48s -> 1014.48s]  I don't know what it does.
[1014.48s -> 1021.57s]  But I'm gonna keep it.
[1021.57s -> 1023.57s]  I have faced Super Greed. He's a pain in the ass.
[1023.57s -> 1027.09s]  He's a super pain
[1027.09s -> 1029.09s]  How did I not get hit right there?
[1029.09s -> 1031.65s]  Don't ask me how I did not
[1031.65s -> 1033.65s]  get hit. I have no idea.
[1033.65s -> 1037.04s]  I need that heart.
[1037.04s -> 1044.98s]  Take that and I'm gonna get this
[1044.98s -> 1048.50s]  heart because I need it.
[1048.50s -> 1055.78s]  Woohoo!
[1055.78s -> 1057.78s]  Boo does have quite a sexy
[1057.78s -> 1059.78s]  voice, I will tell you. It is true.
[1059.78s -> 1064.32s]  I can't get these bombs!
[1064.32s -> 1068.48s]  Teleports you to the boss room.
[1068.48s -> 1070.48s]  Good to know. Thanks a lot, dude.
[1070.48s -> 1072.48s]  Good to know. Oh, I'm turning
[1072.48s -> 1079.08s]  this on because I need it. Do I have
[1079.08s -> 1081.32s]  enough money for anything? Let's find
[1081.32s -> 1084.39s]  out.
[1084.39s -> 1088.23s]  I'm gonna get it. It's always good to have.
[1088.23s -> 1090.23s]  And Steam Sale, I...
[1090.23s -> 1092.23s]  Probably should
[1092.23s -> 1094.23s]  have tried to find the secret room to get the
[1094.23s -> 1098.45s]  Steam Sale. I think it's gonna be
[1098.45s -> 1101.01s]  right here.
[1101.01s -> 1103.38s]  Oh!
[1103.38s -> 1105.62s]  Yeah!
[1105.62s -> 1109.40s]  99 bombs.
[1109.40s -> 1113.75s]  That makes me happy.
[1113.75s -> 1115.75s]  Now I'm gonna go blow up every
[1115.75s -> 1118.12s]  damn thing in
[1118.12s -> 1120.12s]  the item room down here.
[1120.12s -> 1122.87s]  Well, not the gambling room.
[1122.87s -> 1127.16s]  Hey, what's going on?
[1127.16s -> 1129.16s]  I love your little casino here. Everybody
[1129.16s -> 1131.16s]  is gonna...
[1131.16s -> 1135.32s]  I'm gonna kill myself.
[1135.32s -> 1137.32s]  I just tried to make a joke right there
[1137.32s -> 1139.32s]  and my brain is too dumb to be able to
[1139.32s -> 1141.32s]  make a joke and do my joke at the same
[1141.32s -> 1143.32s]  time.
[1143.32s -> 1149.64s]  Whatever.
[1149.64s -> 1154.48s]  Let's go boss room.
[1154.48s -> 1159.43s]  bossfight.com.edu.
[1159.43s -> 1165.51s]  Cain versus Fistula.
[1165.51s -> 1169.09s]  This can...
[1169.09s -> 1171.09s]  You know what? I need to start dropping some tactical
[1171.09s -> 1173.40s]  bombs. This guy can
[1173.40s -> 1177.68s]  be a real pain in the butt.
[1177.68s -> 1179.68s]  Oh god! That was some dodging
[1179.68s -> 1181.68s]  right there! Oh my god!
[1181.68s -> 1183.99s]  How did I do that?
[1183.99s -> 1185.99s]  Alright.
[1185.99s -> 1189.06s]  Okay.
[1189.06s -> 1193.41s]  Juicy juice. Jesus juice.
[1193.41s -> 1199.28s]  Pretty cool. I'm good to go.
[1199.28s -> 1201.97s]  Ah!
[1201.97s -> 1204.40s]  I apologize for the coughing.
[1204.40s -> 1209.52s]  I'm still sick. Full health.
[1209.52s -> 1212.08s]  You know what that means.
[1212.08s -> 1219.88s]  Oh, get away from me.
[1219.88s -> 1221.88s]  That was a collateral right there.
[1221.88s -> 1226.74s]  Oh god!
[1226.74s -> 1229.30s]  Thank you for saving me.
[1229.30s -> 1231.48s]  Book of Shadows. Appreciate it.
[1231.48s -> 1235.96s]  Okay.
[1235.96s -> 1237.96s]  That's another situation
[1237.96s -> 1239.96s]  where I hit E
[1239.96s -> 1241.96s]  right here to drop
[1241.96s -> 1243.96s]  the bomb. I moved over here, looked at
[1243.96s -> 1245.96s]  the chat, and I would have just gotten hurt
[1245.96s -> 1247.96s]  because I wasn't paying...
[1247.96s -> 1250.58s]  Alright, let's not do that again.
[1250.58s -> 1252.58s]  What? Oh.
[1252.58s -> 1255.20s]  Why did...
[1255.20s -> 1258.53s]  Why did that not work?
[1258.53s -> 1260.84s]  Okay, that's good to know that
[1260.84s -> 1263.46s]  that's here.
[1263.46s -> 1265.46s]  Why did that not work? Flies, get out of the way!
[1265.46s -> 1267.46s]  You're ruining everything.
[1267.46s -> 1274.29s]  Thank you.
[1274.29s -> 1276.29s]  If I find one of those blood donation machines, I'm going to
[1276.29s -> 1285.89s]  use the hell out of it.
[1285.89s -> 1287.89s]  There's nothing I can do to get away from that.
[1287.89s -> 1292.82s]  I hate...
[1292.82s -> 1295.89s]  I hate these enemies.
[1295.89s -> 1297.89s]  If there's one enemy I hate in the game...
[1297.89s -> 1299.89s]  Okay, I gotta be quiet. I need to try odd now.
[1299.89s -> 1306.55s]  Oh, I'll take it for sure.
[1306.55s -> 1320.61s]  It's a trap!
[1320.61s -> 1322.61s]  Let's go. Another room with these stupid
[1322.61s -> 1324.61s]  brain bastards. I hate
[1324.61s -> 1327.75s]  these guys. You know what?
[1327.75s -> 1329.75s]  Everyone just blow up right in here.
[1329.75s -> 1334.02s]  Thank you.
[1334.02s -> 1336.02s]  Some might call that a waste. I call it
[1336.02s -> 1348.29s]  a journey. Oh.
[1348.29s -> 1354.48s]  Okay.
[1354.48s -> 1356.48s]  I think the secret room is... Oh, no!
[1356.48s -> 1358.48s]  No!
[1358.48s -> 1361.30s]  You know what? Everyone, come here.
[1361.30s -> 1363.30s]  Let's all have a family picnic. Come stand
[1363.30s -> 1366.56s]  right next to me.
[1366.56s -> 1369.06s]  That's how I deal with those guys.
[1369.06s -> 1374.18s]  I got plenty of bombs. Oh, great.
[1374.18s -> 1377.51s]  Greed. It's alright.
[1377.51s -> 1381.80s]  It's just regular greed. He's a wuss.
[1381.80s -> 1383.80s]  It's just regular greed. Don't worry.
[1383.80s -> 1389.43s]  Give me that money, and give me your key.
[1389.43s -> 1398.44s]  Oh!
[1398.44s -> 1407.08s]  Get away!
[1407.08s -> 1409.38s]  I'm not going in there. Those rooms always
[1409.38s -> 1411.38s]  give me trouble. I always die.
[1411.38s -> 1414.32s]  How do you shoot at an angle?
[1414.32s -> 1416.32s]  So, when I hit up, and I move to the
[1416.32s -> 1418.32s]  left a little bit, it kind of like
[1418.32s -> 1420.32s]  curves it. So, if you hit left and up
[1420.32s -> 1422.32s]  kind of at the same time, you'll curve
[1422.32s -> 1424.82s]  your bullets. Like, bling, bling.
[1424.82s -> 1428.85s]  You can do it any direction, too.
[1428.85s -> 1430.85s]  It doesn't have to be up or down. See, I can do
[1430.85s -> 1441.92s]  it left and right, too.
[1441.92s -> 1443.92s]  I think I'm going to be alright. If I can get some more
[1443.92s -> 1445.92s]  health up, I should be able to kill Mom's
[1445.92s -> 1450.02s]  Heart. For sure.
[1450.02s -> 1452.02s]  Oh, oh, okay, okay, okay. I won't do
[1452.02s -> 1455.99s]  this. Don't worry.
[1455.99s -> 1460.02s]  I promise you, I'm not crazy.
[1460.02s -> 1462.02s]  This room, if you don't know, because this is Wrath of the Lamb.
[1462.02s -> 1464.02s]  This is Added in Wrath of the Lamb.
[1464.02s -> 1466.02s]  When I walk over this, it hurts me.
[1466.02s -> 1468.02s]  For a heart. But, it has a chance
[1468.02s -> 1470.02s]  that it's going to drop something good in the room.
[1470.02s -> 1472.02s]  So, I'm going to keep doing it.
[1472.02s -> 1474.02s]  Come on, keep hurting me.
[1474.02s -> 1478.88s]  I know you want to give me something.
[1478.88s -> 1482.15s]  Oh, fine.
[1482.15s -> 1484.15s]  Because now, I can just go all the way over here
[1484.15s -> 1486.15s]  and go back to that room where all those hearts were.
[1486.15s -> 1488.64s]  And...
[1488.64s -> 1493.44s]  I'm fine.
[1497.28s -> 1499.28s]  What? What? What?
[1499.28s -> 1501.28s]  What? What? What? What?
[1501.28s -> 1504.29s]  Okay.
[1504.29s -> 1506.29s]  Oh. I almost
[1506.29s -> 1508.29s]  just had a heart attack. I thought I could not get back
[1508.29s -> 1510.53s]  into this room.
[1510.53s -> 1512.53s]  I would have just been so bad
[1512.53s -> 1522.20s]  right there.
[1522.20s -> 1525.01s]  I don't have enough for the ladder.
[1525.01s -> 1531.80s]  I'll probably get it later. What is the Sword
[1531.80s -> 1533.80s]  Room? The Sword Room,
[1533.80s -> 1535.80s]  when you go in there, you can only go in there with full health.
[1535.80s -> 1538.04s]  And it's a...
[1538.04s -> 1540.04s]  You fight a wave of enemies.
[1540.04s -> 1542.04s]  Three waves of enemies.
[1542.04s -> 1544.04s]  And then after, you get to have the item that's in the room.
[1544.04s -> 1548.90s]  It's pretty cool. I don't...
[1548.90s -> 1550.90s]  I just never go into it because I always end up getting myself
[1550.90s -> 1554.87s]  killed in there. Troll Bomb,
[1554.87s -> 1557.68s]  get away. Now I can get the ladder
[1557.68s -> 1559.68s]  if I want it. No!
[1559.68s -> 1561.68s]  Stop it. You
[1561.68s -> 1564.50s]  bad pets.
[1564.50s -> 1566.50s]  I'll go get it. Might as well
[1566.50s -> 1570.53s]  have it, right? Might as well own
[1570.53s -> 1576.87s]  it. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go,
[1576.87s -> 1580.58s]  go, go. I'll have you.
[1580.58s -> 1582.58s]  Thank you very much.
[1582.58s -> 1584.58s]  Oh. I don't need the heart.
[1584.58s -> 1588.61s]  Because I can go up here.
[1588.61s -> 1590.61s]  Blue hearts are spirit hearts.
[1590.61s -> 1592.92s]  So when I pick up a spirit heart,
[1592.92s -> 1594.92s]  it lasts
[1594.92s -> 1596.92s]  only as long as it's there.
[1596.92s -> 1598.92s]  See how the red hearts are there pretty much
[1598.92s -> 1601.80s]  permanently? The spirit hearts
[1601.80s -> 1603.80s]  are only there until they get... If I get
[1603.80s -> 1605.80s]  hurt right now, it's going to take that spirit heart away and I don't
[1605.80s -> 1607.80s]  get it back. Even if I get health.
[1607.80s -> 1612.53s]  I'm playing Bomberman right now. I feel like
[1612.53s -> 1617.14s]  I'm like spelunking. Ooh,
[1617.14s -> 1620.15s]  the rock. Oh, I
[1620.15s -> 1622.15s]  must be doing max damage, am I?
[1622.15s -> 1624.15s]  Yeah, I'm doing the maximum amount
[1624.15s -> 1626.15s]  of damage you can do in the game.
[1626.15s -> 1628.15s]  So that's good. That's good.
[1628.15s -> 1630.15s]  I'm stuck.
[1630.15s -> 1632.84s]  Oh, I got
[1632.84s -> 1635.46s]  stuck on the rock.
[1635.46s -> 1640.26s]  I think I have my book of shadows.
[1640.26s -> 1643.59s]  Okay, that's Epikac.
[1643.59s -> 1645.83s]  I don't want it. Is that
[1645.83s -> 1647.83s]  Epikac or is that Chemical Peel?
[1647.83s -> 1650.07s]  I don't know. I don't want it.
[1650.07s -> 1652.07s]  I hate Epikac. Epikac
[1652.07s -> 1654.07s]  makes you shoot like those green balls and you can
[1654.07s -> 1656.07s]  hurt yourself with it. I always kill
[1656.07s -> 1658.07s]  myself, guaranteed, with it every time.
[1658.07s -> 1663.44s]  Cane versus war.
[1663.44s -> 1665.44s]  One of the four horsemen.
[1665.44s -> 1667.44s]  Oh my god, I am destroying
[1667.44s -> 1671.35s]  him. I am absolutely
[1671.35s -> 1673.78s]  destroying him. Wow.
[1673.78s -> 1675.78s]  Usually this guy takes a lot more hits than this.
[1675.78s -> 1678.34s]  Okay, see you later, man.
[1678.34s -> 1680.64s]  And I got a cube of meat.
[1680.64s -> 1682.64s]  And that's Chemical Peel? That's Chemical Peel?
[1682.64s -> 1686.80s]  Alright. No deal with the
[1686.80s -> 1688.80s]  devil. I don't want the deal with the devil.
[1688.80s -> 1690.80s]  Chemical Peel.
[1690.80s -> 1693.62s]  If that's Chemical Peel, then I will get it.
[1693.62s -> 1696.12s]  I'm so scared, but what if it's Epikac?
[1696.12s -> 1699.96s]  Alright.
[1699.96s -> 1701.96s]  At least a dozen people have said it's
[1701.96s -> 1704.32s]  not Epikac.
[1704.32s -> 1706.32s]  Oh, thank god.
[1706.32s -> 1711.51s]  This game is
[1711.51s -> 1713.51s]  so worth it.
[1713.51s -> 1715.68s]  Somebody just asked if it's a game worth it.
[1715.68s -> 1717.68s]  Yeah, it's worth it. Absolutely.
[1717.68s -> 1720.50s]  It is probably the best game
[1720.50s -> 1722.50s]  I've played for under
[1722.50s -> 1724.74s]  twenty dollars ever.
[1724.74s -> 1728.07s]  This game is only five bucks.
[1728.07s -> 1730.69s]  Without the sale,
[1730.69s -> 1733.12s]  the expansion and everything, I think
[1733.12s -> 1735.12s]  it's eight dollars with everything.
[1735.12s -> 1738.00s]  But, I mean, I've spent
[1738.00s -> 1740.24s]  more money on games
[1740.24s -> 1742.24s]  that I've never played than I have
[1742.24s -> 1744.61s]  on this. I bought Deus Ex
[1744.61s -> 1746.61s]  for sixty dollars, and I
[1746.61s -> 1748.61s]  played the game for an hour and ten minutes.
[1748.61s -> 1750.61s]  I didn't like it.
[1750.61s -> 1754.84s]  I never heard this music before.
[1754.84s -> 1757.14s]  Actually, no, I think I have. I hate
[1757.14s -> 1759.14s]  these enemies. These are the worst. You have to kill their hearts.
[1759.14s -> 1763.56s]  Die!
[1763.56s -> 1768.21s]  Oh, thank you. Yeah, this game
[1768.21s -> 1770.21s]  is four dollars and ninety-nine cents
[1770.21s -> 1773.03s]  to buy it.
[1773.03s -> 1775.03s]  I have the expansion, though, as well. I think the expansion
[1775.03s -> 1777.27s]  is three bucks. So it's going to
[1777.27s -> 1779.27s]  cost me eight dollars for everything. But
[1779.27s -> 1781.27s]  there's a Steam sale, I think,
[1781.27s -> 1783.27s]  still going.
[1783.27s -> 1785.27s]  You know what? I'm going to quench this once
[1785.27s -> 1787.27s]  and for all. I'm going to just look
[1787.27s -> 1789.27s]  and see how much this is.
[1789.27s -> 1791.51s]  View store page.
[1791.51s -> 1797.70s]  Binding of Isaac.
[1797.70s -> 1799.70s]  Okay, so, the Binding, yeah, so it is
[1799.70s -> 1802.32s]  four ninety-nine for the Binding of
[1802.32s -> 1804.32s]  Isaac, if you can see. And then
[1804.32s -> 1806.56s]  the Wrath
[1806.56s -> 1808.56s]  of the Lamb DLC is
[1808.56s -> 1811.00s]  three bucks. So there you go.
[1811.00s -> 1813.68s]  The Steam sale is over on it,
[1813.68s -> 1816.88s]  apparently. It was over a while ago, I think.
[1822.00s -> 1829.22s]  It's a very good price.
[1829.22s -> 1831.22s]  The last time I spent
[1831.22s -> 1833.78s]  less than five dollars on a game,
[1833.78s -> 1835.78s]  or five dollars on a game, and
[1835.78s -> 1837.78s]  I'm using this.
[1837.78s -> 1840.60s]  Under twenty dollars, last time
[1840.60s -> 1842.60s]  I spent that and actually, like, really enjoyed
[1842.60s -> 1844.60s]  it and played for a long time, was probably
[1844.60s -> 1847.73s]  Orcs Must Die.
[1847.73s -> 1849.73s]  Orcs Must Die, I got a lot of playtime
[1849.73s -> 1851.73s]  out of that and the game was only fifteen bucks.
[1851.73s -> 1855.51s]  So it's, yeah, I'd say
[1855.51s -> 1857.51s]  it's a steal at this price.
[1857.51s -> 1861.35s]  You'll put at least thirty to fifty hours
[1861.35s -> 1863.35s]  into this game. If you really enjoy it,
[1863.35s -> 1865.35s]  you'll put at least thirty hours into
[1865.35s -> 1871.94s]  it, at least. Oh,
[1871.94s -> 1874.50s]  Otto. Where is Otto?
[1874.50s -> 1881.16s]  My dog. And
[1881.16s -> 1883.16s]  oh, I didn't want to open that. I could have just blown it up.
[1883.16s -> 1885.97s]  I could have just blown the damn
[1885.97s -> 1889.04s]  thing up. Flatpenny.
[1889.04s -> 1891.28s]  No, I don't want that.
[1891.28s -> 1895.00s]  I do not want you.
[1895.00s -> 1897.94s]  Go! Ah!
[1897.94s -> 1899.94s]  Ah, what a bad place for these enemies.
[1899.94s -> 1903.27s]  At least I have this.
[1903.27s -> 1905.27s]  I would have taken so much damage right there.
[1905.27s -> 1907.27s]  It's not even funny. I would have taken
[1907.27s -> 1909.27s]  a thousand points. I would have died.
[1909.27s -> 1914.20s]  I probably would have died right there. Geez.
[1914.20s -> 1916.20s]  Oh, get away from me, you
[1916.20s -> 1918.20s]  jumping frog freaks.
[1918.20s -> 1925.92s]  Ah, damn it.
[1925.92s -> 1927.92s]  There we go. See you later.
[1927.92s -> 1930.87s]  Ah!
[1930.87s -> 1935.28s]  Yeah, you know, I looked, I was looking
[1935.28s -> 1937.91s]  at DayZ. DayZ
[1937.91s -> 1939.91s]  looks pretty cool. I just, I thought it was
[1939.91s -> 1941.91s]  a standalone mod
[1941.91s -> 1943.91s]  or a standalone game.
[1943.91s -> 1945.91s]  Arma 2 was like fifty dollars
[1945.91s -> 1948.60s]  for the whole package, isn't it?
[1948.60s -> 1950.60s]  I need to drop some
[1950.60s -> 1954.44s]  cash on that.
[1954.44s -> 1956.44s]  You need Arma 2 and then you need Arma 2,
[1956.44s -> 1958.44s]  one of Arma 2's expansion packs
[1958.44s -> 1960.44s]  or something to be able to play it.
[1960.44s -> 1962.44s]  I think Arma 2 was thirty-nine or forty
[1962.44s -> 1964.44s]  or something. When I saw that
[1964.44s -> 1970.32s]  I was like...
[1970.32s -> 1972.76s]  I'm going this way. So Arma 2 is thirty
[1972.76s -> 1974.76s]  and then you need an expansion too, don't you?
[1974.76s -> 1979.75s]  That expansion.
[1979.75s -> 1984.23s]  Let's go, you...
[1984.23s -> 1987.17s]  Oh, you egg burger.
[1987.17s -> 1989.17s]  You know what? Let's go.
[1989.17s -> 1991.17s]  Let's fight. Come stand next to me.
[1991.17s -> 1994.05s]  We'll talk.
[1994.05s -> 2003.00s]  I keep thinking
[2003.00s -> 2005.00s]  that...bad, bad. I can't even hit
[2005.00s -> 2007.00s]  this guy. Get out of the way, you son of a...
[2007.00s -> 2010.20s]  Ugh.
[2010.20s -> 2012.20s]  This guy is blocking the way of me shooting him.
[2012.20s -> 2014.20s]  Stupid son of a B-I.
[2014.20s -> 2016.20s]  I-I-I.
[2016.20s -> 2022.08s]  Capital I.
[2022.08s -> 2024.96s]  Everybody in this room blows up.
[2024.96s -> 2026.96s]  Arma 2 is free? What?
[2026.96s -> 2032.15s]  Arma 2 is...last time
[2032.15s -> 2034.15s]  I looked at it, Arma 2 was money.
[2034.15s -> 2043.24s]  Diablo 3's real money auction house,
[2043.24s -> 2045.24s]  I have not even used it.
[2045.24s -> 2047.60s]  I don't
[2047.60s -> 2051.00s]  even care. I was mad
[2051.00s -> 2053.00s]  about it at first and I was kind of like
[2053.00s -> 2055.00s]  that's a little weird, but
[2055.00s -> 2057.17s]  it's got to help
[2057.17s -> 2059.17s]  drive the game for years.
[2059.17s -> 2061.48s]  So I'm not really
[2061.48s -> 2066.72s]  all that concerned about it.
[2066.72s -> 2068.72s]  Open sesame. I think I'm going to fight mom
[2068.72s -> 2070.96s]  here in a second. Maybe this
[2070.96s -> 2072.96s]  next room. Number dime.
[2072.96s -> 2079.81s]  Alright, let's go fight...
[2079.81s -> 2082.05s]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I need to get some...
[2082.05s -> 2086.96s]  I get some coins.
[2086.96s -> 2092.60s]  I got coins.
[2092.60s -> 2095.60s]  Operation 2033
[2095.60s -> 2099.38s]  Metro.
[2099.38s -> 2101.38s]  That game's coming out with a sequel soon, aren't they?
[2101.38s -> 2105.14s]  I'll get the compass just cause I'm not
[2105.14s -> 2108.28s]  going to be able to buy anything later.
[2108.28s -> 2110.28s]  Alright, let's go fight. Let's go fight
[2110.28s -> 2112.28s]  mom's big, fat,
[2112.28s -> 2120.60s]  disgusting leg.
[2120.60s -> 2125.59s]  Follow me. I don't want
[2125.59s -> 2127.59s]  to go in the sword room. It scares
[2127.59s -> 2129.59s]  me. Cause if I lose health
[2129.59s -> 2131.59s]  and I die to mom,
[2131.59s -> 2133.59s]  I am going to be
[2133.59s -> 2137.36s]  PO'd. Let's go
[2137.36s -> 2140.88s]  mom. Oh, what do you say
[2140.88s -> 2142.88s]  mommy dearest? Come on,
[2142.88s -> 2144.88s]  step on yourself. Oh, she
[2144.88s -> 2146.88s]  is...I'm killing her so bad.
[2146.88s -> 2149.19s]  Ugh.
[2149.19s -> 2154.31s]  Alright, that's fine. Go ahead, swap me. I don't care.
[2154.31s -> 2157.00s]  And she's going to do it.
[2157.00s -> 2159.00s]  Isaac.
[2159.00s -> 2163.72s]  Hahaha.
[2163.72s -> 2167.30s]  Isaac.
[2167.30s -> 2170.88s]  Let's keep going. I only got
[2170.88s -> 2173.25s]  two more rooms. And then maybe
[2173.25s -> 2175.25s]  I can go...I don't know if I'm going to be able to go to Shoal.
[2175.25s -> 2177.25s]  I don't think I've beaten the game enough times to go
[2177.25s -> 2180.13s]  to Shoal every time.
[2180.13s -> 2182.13s]  Ugh. What's that?
[2182.13s -> 2186.16s]  What's that? I want to look at it.
[2186.16s -> 2188.16s]  Cursed skull. Oh, boo.
[2188.16s -> 2192.07s]  Boo, what does this do?
[2192.07s -> 2194.44s]  Ugh, I don't know.
[2194.44s -> 2196.44s]  What does a cursed skull do, guys? Does anybody
[2196.44s -> 2204.93s]  know? Does anybody know?
[2204.93s -> 2206.93s]  I need to know what it does.
[2206.93s -> 2208.93s]  Cause if it's good, I want to keep it.
[2208.93s -> 2210.93s]  Alright, we'll come back to it. I'll come back. It's going to
[2210.93s -> 2215.48s]  be there. Cursed skull is bad.
[2215.48s -> 2217.48s]  Okay. Alright, good to know.
[2217.48s -> 2220.10s]  Do not get this.
[2220.10s -> 2224.07s]  Okay.
[2224.07s -> 2226.07s]  Chest inside of a chest. Chestception.
[2226.07s -> 2229.78s]  Get away from me.
[2229.78s -> 2232.40s]  Health up. Exactly what
[2232.40s -> 2237.40s]  I was looking for. Oh, it's me.
[2237.40s -> 2239.40s]  Go get him, flies. Yeah.
[2239.40s -> 2244.90s]  The Book of Shadows is the thing that's
[2244.90s -> 2246.90s]  making this playthrough possible.
[2246.90s -> 2249.59s]  It really is.
[2249.59s -> 2251.59s]  Oh, go, go, go, go, go! Yes.
[2251.59s -> 2255.11s]  Um...
[2255.11s -> 2257.11s]  Lord have mercy on me. Geez.
[2257.11s -> 2260.31s]  Health up.
[2260.31s -> 2263.06s]  Health up again.
[2263.06s -> 2265.88s]  Oh my god. You're going to be
[2265.88s -> 2267.88s]  kidding me. Teleport pills. Let's just take
[2267.88s -> 2271.97s]  them. I'd like to thank
[2271.97s -> 2273.97s]  the Book of Shadows for making this possible
[2273.97s -> 2275.97s]  because without him, I wouldn't be
[2275.97s -> 2277.97s]  receiving this award and I want to thank
[2277.97s -> 2279.97s]  my mother and my father and my parents.
[2279.97s -> 2287.08s]  Alright, I'm not going in the secret room.
[2287.08s -> 2289.08s]  Let's take a look who's in there.
[2289.08s -> 2291.25s]  My buddy Greed.
[2291.25s -> 2294.32s]  The name's Greed.
[2294.32s -> 2299.57s]  Oh, gad.
[2299.57s -> 2306.02s]  See ya.
[2306.02s -> 2308.02s]  If Isaac's health is brought down to half
[2308.02s -> 2310.02s]  of a heart, Isaac is then teleported
[2310.02s -> 2312.02s]  to the last room completed.
[2312.02s -> 2314.69s]  Um, that sounds
[2314.69s -> 2317.32s]  pretty incredible. That sounds pretty
[2317.32s -> 2319.32s]  ridiculous. Actually, but to be
[2319.32s -> 2321.32s]  honest, even if you complete the last
[2321.32s -> 2323.32s]  room with half a heart, when you get to the next room
[2323.32s -> 2325.32s]  after the last room, you're
[2325.32s -> 2330.37s]  probably going to die.
[2330.37s -> 2332.55s]  That's still pretty cool though. If I did
[2332.55s -> 2334.55s]  not have the mushroom, I would absolutely be taking
[2334.55s -> 2340.82s]  that. Get out of here,
[2340.82s -> 2343.83s]  you spider.
[2343.83s -> 2346.13s]  I never liked spiders.
[2346.13s -> 2351.57s]  Creepy-crawly. You want to thank your
[2351.57s -> 2353.57s]  mother? She tried to kill you.
[2353.57s -> 2355.57s]  This is true. This is very true.
[2355.57s -> 2358.07s]  But I have a short
[2358.07s -> 2360.07s]  term memory loss. I forgot that.
[2360.07s -> 2362.88s]  I forgot those things.
[2362.88s -> 2364.88s]  Get. I hate these guys.
[2364.88s -> 2367.12s]  These guys are annoying. I stick
[2367.12s -> 2369.12s]  my head up and then, no, I joke, bye, you
[2369.12s -> 2372.84s]  don't hit me. Yes, I will take
[2372.84s -> 2376.29s]  that. Every single door is
[2376.29s -> 2378.29s]  now open down here.
[2378.29s -> 2384.69s]  What's the game from E3 you're looking forward
[2384.69s -> 2387.38s]  to the most? Um,
[2387.38s -> 2391.16s]  I, you know, the Wii U.
[2391.16s -> 2393.16s]  The Wii U is actually
[2393.16s -> 2396.29s]  really, really cool.
[2396.29s -> 2398.29s]  It's, it's very, very interesting.
[2398.29s -> 2400.29s]  It's kind of like when the Wii first came out.
[2400.29s -> 2402.29s]  It was like, what is that?
[2402.29s -> 2404.72s]  I think I might just get it.
[2404.72s -> 2406.72s]  It looks like it could be fun.
[2406.72s -> 2408.72s]  Because the coolest thing in the entire world
[2408.72s -> 2410.72s]  with the Wii U, let me, I'll explain this.
[2410.72s -> 2412.72s]  This is the coolest thing ever.
[2412.72s -> 2414.72s]  So if you're playing on a TV
[2414.72s -> 2416.72s]  that's, and then you're like, let's say you're in your
[2416.72s -> 2418.72s]  living room. And
[2418.72s -> 2420.72s]  somebody comes in and they say, oh,
[2420.72s -> 2422.72s]  I want to, I want to, I need the TV, I want, I want to use
[2422.72s -> 2424.72s]  the TV. And you're like, dude,
[2424.72s -> 2426.72s]  I'm playing a game. You want this?
[2426.72s -> 2428.72s]  No, no, you can't take the TV. And
[2428.72s -> 2430.72s]  sometimes, I mean, back when I was younger, it
[2430.72s -> 2432.72s]  didn't matter how much you complained.
[2432.72s -> 2434.72s]  Or how much you wanted to, oh my
[2434.72s -> 2436.72s]  god. Or how much you wanted to
[2436.72s -> 2438.72s]  stay in the room. You had to get kicked off the TV.
[2438.72s -> 2440.72s]  With the Wii U,
[2440.72s -> 2442.72s]  it's going, they're going to make it so
[2442.72s -> 2444.72s]  when somebody kicks you off the TV,
[2444.72s -> 2447.03s]  you can just, I'm using like
[2447.03s -> 2449.03s]  my hands right now. I'm not even like, my hands aren't even on the keyboard.
[2449.03s -> 2451.03s]  You can, it goes to the screen.
[2451.03s -> 2453.03s]  You have like a, it's a mini TV
[2453.03s -> 2455.03s]  on the screen.
[2455.03s -> 2457.40s]  So let's say you get kicked off, you can
[2457.40s -> 2459.40s]  just play on the Wii U pad screen.
[2459.40s -> 2461.40s]  Like, okay, fine, you can take it. I'll go in
[2461.40s -> 2463.76s]  my room and play the game. That's insane.
[2463.76s -> 2465.76s]  That's unbelievable.
[2465.76s -> 2467.76s]  That is one of the coolest things, I think, of that
[2467.76s -> 2469.76s]  system so far, is the fact that you
[2469.76s -> 2471.76s]  can like, take the system
[2471.76s -> 2473.76s]  with you around the house.
[2473.76s -> 2484.31s]  Go to this last room. And plus,
[2484.31s -> 2486.31s]  I mean, this might sound kind of like,
[2486.31s -> 2488.31s]  kind of disgusting, but
[2488.31s -> 2490.31s]  like, how, how awesome
[2490.31s -> 2492.31s]  would that be if you were just like, you know,
[2492.31s -> 2494.31s]  playing Super Mario 15,
[2494.31s -> 2496.31s]  whatever comes out.
[2496.31s -> 2498.31s]  You know, I gotta take like a dump.
[2498.31s -> 2500.31s]  You can just like, take it
[2500.31s -> 2502.98s]  into the bathroom.
[2502.98s -> 2504.98s]  I know, I know, I'm gross, I know.
[2504.98s -> 2507.67s]  But still, like, the possibilities
[2507.67s -> 2509.84s]  are, are endless.
[2509.84s -> 2515.41s]  Somebody should actually
[2515.41s -> 2517.41s]  grab those teleport pills.
[2517.41s -> 2519.84s]  I will. No, I, no,
[2519.84s -> 2521.84s]  I won't. I don't have any, I don't, I'm gonna hurt
[2521.84s -> 2528.56s]  myself if I go in there. Let's just go
[2528.56s -> 2533.88s]  fight the boss. Bang, bang.
[2533.88s -> 2537.33s]  Bang. The Wii U.
[2537.33s -> 2540.02s]  I don't like the name.
[2540.02s -> 2542.02s]  That's, I wish they would change the name.
[2542.02s -> 2547.97s]  Imagine if you dropped it
[2547.97s -> 2550.66s]  in the toilet.
[2553.73s -> 2557.00s]  I can imagine that would be one of the worst
[2557.00s -> 2559.00s]  things to possibly happen.
[2559.00s -> 2562.07s]  But I guess
[2562.07s -> 2564.07s]  why, how would you drop it in the
[2564.07s -> 2566.69s]  toilet? Like, oh, whoops!
[2566.69s -> 2568.69s]  Chup-plunk!
[2568.69s -> 2576.18s]  I just
[2576.18s -> 2578.18s]  thought of the noise they would make.
[2578.18s -> 2583.48s]  Chup-plunk!
[2583.48s -> 2585.48s]  It's a big thing, man. It's a pretty big device.
[2585.48s -> 2588.74s]  Let's go kill
[2588.74s -> 2590.74s]  Mom. Let's go fight Mommy Dearest.
[2590.74s -> 2594.24s]  Oh,
[2594.24s -> 2596.24s]  God.
[2596.24s -> 2600.53s]  Get away from me. You know, I'm not
[2600.53s -> 2602.53s]  even gonna go item hunting. I'm just gonna
[2602.53s -> 2604.53s]  try and kill Mom.
[2604.53s -> 2606.53s]  Ah, a heft!
[2606.53s -> 2611.14s]  A heft! Yeah, I'm
[2611.14s -> 2613.14s]  not going item hunting. I'm just gonna go try and
[2613.14s -> 2615.32s]  go for the kill, I think.
[2615.32s -> 2617.32s]  Tears up. I think I'm at max
[2617.32s -> 2619.94s]  tears, too. How am I not at max
[2619.94s -> 2625.38s]  tears? Does it make any sense?
[2625.38s -> 2627.38s]  Oh, you know what? You only live once.
[2627.38s -> 2631.09s]  Yeah, you're gonna kill me. Sorry, buddy.
[2631.09s -> 2633.72s]  Neither is your friend over here.
[2633.72s -> 2640.04s]  I live.
[2640.04s -> 2642.53s]  We you.
[2642.53s -> 2644.84s]  Oh, God!
[2644.84s -> 2647.91s]  The noises I make when I play
[2647.91s -> 2649.91s]  this game really surprises me.
[2649.91s -> 2654.32s]  I got back to 99 bombs. Are you kidding
[2654.32s -> 2657.65s]  me? Everybody blows up.
[2657.65s -> 2663.72s]  Boom, boom. Alright.
[2663.72s -> 2668.18s]  Good to go. No, I did
[2668.18s -> 2670.18s]  not take the brimstone from the devil.
[2670.18s -> 2672.18s]  For a very important reason.
[2672.18s -> 2674.55s]  Because brimstone,
[2674.55s -> 2676.55s]  that would have taken two hearts away. And if I
[2676.55s -> 2678.55s]  get to go to shoal,
[2678.55s -> 2681.17s]  I'm gonna want those two hearts.
[2681.17s -> 2683.17s]  And I'm doing so much damage
[2683.17s -> 2685.17s]  right now. It doesn't even matter at this point.
[2685.17s -> 2687.17s]  I have a very, very, very, very, very
[2687.17s -> 2689.17s]  good setup. So I think I'm okay.
[2689.17s -> 2692.82s]  I'll get hit by a big
[2692.82s -> 2699.48s]  rotten tooth. Double
[2699.48s -> 2702.42s]  gluttony. Double gluttony!
[2702.42s -> 2705.11s]  No! Get away from me!
[2705.11s -> 2708.63s]  Get away from me, gluttony!
[2708.63s -> 2710.63s]  Will you just die?
[2710.63s -> 2712.63s]  That's all I ask.
[2712.63s -> 2715.25s]  I just ask of you to be dead.
[2715.25s -> 2719.73s]  That's all I ask.
[2719.73s -> 2725.16s]  Get...
[2725.16s -> 2727.16s]  Oh, that guy. I almost got a tooth collateral.
[2727.16s -> 2729.33s]  Only in The Binding of Isaac can you say
[2729.33s -> 2731.33s]  the words tooth collateral.
[2731.33s -> 2733.33s]  And have it make sense.
[2733.33s -> 2737.68s]  You know what? I'm going the other way.
[2737.68s -> 2739.68s]  I'm ending this. I'm literally
[2739.68s -> 2741.68s]  ending this right now.
[2741.68s -> 2744.24s]  I'm going into the...
[2744.24s -> 2746.42s]  I'm ending this like I'm going into...
[2746.42s -> 2748.42s]  Oh god, I can't even talk.
[2748.42s -> 2754.24s]  Go! Go!
[2754.24s -> 2760.90s]  Alright, I'm not gonna go the other way.
[2760.90s -> 2762.90s]  I'm just going to fight her.
[2762.90s -> 2764.90s]  I'm going to fight her.
[2764.90s -> 2768.74s]  She's got nothing on me.
[2768.74s -> 2775.20s]  And... who's in here?
[2775.20s -> 2779.54s]  Get...
[2779.54s -> 2787.28s]  Dude, what's the Super Meat Boy challenge?
[2787.28s -> 2789.28s]  Ooh, I can...
[2789.28s -> 2791.28s]  Alright, the real goal here is to...
[2791.28s -> 2793.28s]  Oh god! No, I'm gonna kill him!
[2793.28s -> 2795.78s]  No!
[2795.78s -> 2797.78s]  I always do that, man.
[2797.78s -> 2799.78s]  I do that way too often.
[2799.78s -> 2801.78s]  Hold on, I gotta text.
[2801.78s -> 2812.58s]  Alright. Text complete.
[2812.58s -> 2819.36s]  Jerma, turn around. The treasure room
[2819.36s -> 2821.36s]  can only be one room away over there.
[2821.36s -> 2824.37s]  And... let's...
[2824.37s -> 2828.15s]  Oh, that has to be right here.
[2828.15s -> 2831.97s]  You are absolutely right, my friend.
[2831.97s -> 2833.97s]  Good eyes. But I guess at this point
[2833.97s -> 2835.97s]  if I kill Mom right here
[2835.97s -> 2838.21s]  then... and I don't go to Shoal
[2838.21s -> 2840.21s]  then it's over anyways.
[2840.21s -> 2842.21s]  What? What's this? What the hell is this?
[2842.21s -> 2844.21s]  What is that?
[2844.21s -> 2847.20s]  It lives?
[2847.20s -> 2849.20s]  Who is this guy?
[2849.20s -> 2851.89s]  What? What?
[2851.89s -> 2854.96s]  Is that like a different version of
[2854.96s -> 2856.96s]  Mom's heart?
[2856.96s -> 2859.72s]  Oh no.
[2859.72s -> 2861.72s]  Oh no, I can't fight those things.
[2861.72s -> 2864.34s]  Oh, okay, I'm good.
[2864.34s -> 2866.34s]  Oh, did you see that, like, ricochet?
[2866.34s -> 2870.68s]  Let's go, it lives.
[2870.68s -> 2872.68s]  Don't you know it's impolite to text during a live stream?
[2872.68s -> 2874.68s]  That's true, but...
[2874.68s -> 2876.68s]  Oh my god!
[2876.68s -> 2879.68s]  It was my mother!
[2879.68s -> 2881.68s]  Oh god! I'm so scared!
[2881.68s -> 2883.92s]  I'm freaking out!
[2886.55s -> 2888.55s]  I'm gonna do it! I did it!
[2888.55s -> 2890.55s]  I did it!
[2890.55s -> 2892.55s]  Yeah! Yeah, yeah.
[2892.55s -> 2895.24s]  Hey, yeah. It was my mother.
[2895.24s -> 2897.86s]  Alright, um...
[2897.86s -> 2899.86s]  Looks like I'm not gonna be able to go to Shoal.
[2899.86s -> 2902.68s]  A poop!
[2902.68s -> 2904.85s]  Oh, I finally
[2904.85s -> 2907.35s]  unlocked that guy.
[2907.35s -> 2909.91s]  Took me long enough. Cause I played
[2909.91s -> 2912.32s]  Isaac. What? What?
[2912.32s -> 2915.08s]  What's going on? What?
[2915.08s -> 2918.13s]  What? Oh dear
[2918.13s -> 2920.56s]  goodness. I made
[2920.56s -> 2922.87s]  it to heaven.
[2922.87s -> 2927.91s]  Okay.
[2927.91s -> 2931.75s]  Um...
[2931.75s -> 2933.75s]  Oh god, I am scared right now.
[2933.75s -> 2936.44s]  This is the first time I've ever done this.
[2936.44s -> 2938.93s]  No!
[2938.93s -> 2940.93s]  No, no, I gotta blow...
[2940.93s -> 2942.93s]  No! No, I'm freaking out way too much!
[2942.93s -> 2944.93s]  Slow down. Alright.
[2944.93s -> 2948.71s]  Oh my god, he's gonna kill me!
[2948.71s -> 2953.00s]  I gotta get rid of all this stuff in the room.
[2953.00s -> 2955.00s]  This is the problem right here.
[2955.00s -> 2958.71s]  God, what a mess.
[2958.71s -> 2965.09s]  I can't...
[2965.09s -> 2969.25s]  What's... There's no health bar
[2969.25s -> 2972.32s]  left. Get out of here. Get...
[2972.32s -> 2974.32s]  Get away from me!
[2974.32s -> 2978.10s]  Oh, a chest inside
[2978.10s -> 2982.90s]  of a chest. The citadel.
[2982.90s -> 2984.90s]  Give me whatever's in here.
[2984.90s -> 2989.57s]  Okay, I
[2989.57s -> 2991.57s]  have a feeling. Yeah, right.
[2991.57s -> 2993.57s]  Say goodbye, guys. This is it.
[2993.57s -> 2995.57s]  See you later. Oh,
[2995.57s -> 2997.57s]  if I did not have the book of shadows,
[2997.57s -> 3000.32s]  I would have been done.
[3000.32s -> 3002.32s]  Again, I'd like to thank the book of shadows for
[3002.32s -> 3005.97s]  making this all possible.
[3005.97s -> 3013.27s]  Geez. Again?
[3013.27s -> 3016.02s]  Again. Again.
[3016.02s -> 3018.96s]  Is every single room like a boss?
[3018.96s -> 3020.96s]  Oh, get that bomb
[3020.96s -> 3026.72s]  placement. Every single room
[3026.72s -> 3029.22s]  is a mini boss then, huh?
[3029.22s -> 3038.50s]  Wow. Oh my god.
[3038.50s -> 3042.21s]  Hmm...
[3042.21s -> 3045.14s]  Two sloths.
[3045.14s -> 3047.14s]  And a spirit heart. That's okay, I'll take it.
[3047.14s -> 3049.83s]  Oh my god. I'm actually...
[3049.83s -> 3051.83s]  I think I'm actually gonna be... I'm gonna do
[3051.83s -> 3053.83s]  this, guys, because I have the book of shadows.
[3053.83s -> 3055.83s]  I can... I can be incredibly
[3055.83s -> 3057.83s]  reckless because I have the book of shadows.
[3057.83s -> 3059.83s]  Look at how just reckless I'm being.
[3059.83s -> 3063.86s]  Ooh.
[3063.86s -> 3071.41s]  Okay. Red patch.
[3071.41s -> 3073.84s]  Don't remember what red patch does.
[3073.84s -> 3075.84s]  Stream? I need
[3075.84s -> 3077.84s]  your... I need your help.
[3077.84s -> 3084.50s]  I could go to the secret room.
[3084.50s -> 3091.60s]  Don't get too reckless.
[3091.60s -> 3093.60s]  That's a good... Good advice.
[3093.60s -> 3098.85s]  Red patch.
[3098.85s -> 3100.85s]  What does it do? I don't have
[3100.85s -> 3102.85s]  the time or the patience
[3102.85s -> 3106.50s]  to look it up.
[3106.50s -> 3109.96s]  I'll stick with it.
[3109.96s -> 3114.69s]  I'm gonna stick with it. Okay.
[3114.69s -> 3116.69s]  I gotta use this to my advantage.
[3116.69s -> 3119.06s]  Use the guard
[3119.06s -> 3122.32s]  to my advantage. It's just like shoot
[3122.32s -> 3124.32s]  mania. No, it's gone.
[3124.32s -> 3126.32s]  Oh my god.
[3126.32s -> 3130.28s]  Gotta get rid of one of them.
[3130.28s -> 3132.28s]  Go away! Get away!
[3132.28s -> 3135.67s]  How much life does this
[3135.67s -> 3137.67s]  one... Oh my god.
[3137.67s -> 3143.24s]  Really now?
[3143.24s -> 3145.24s]  It increases your attack when you get hit?
[3145.24s -> 3147.24s]  Okay, I don't want that because I have max damage
[3147.24s -> 3153.76s]  right now. I'm gonna take the
[3153.76s -> 3158.56s]  mushroom still. Let's go.
[3158.56s -> 3160.56s]  Hmm. Yeah.
[3160.56s -> 3162.56s]  Forget it. I'm going this way.
[3162.56s -> 3167.75s]  Give me that heart.
[3167.75s -> 3169.75s]  Secret room already was there.
[3169.75s -> 3171.75s]  I'm gonna go up and then down.
[3171.75s -> 3175.08s]  Oh, why did I waste that? I didn't
[3175.08s -> 3177.08s]  even need it. They just scared me.
[3177.08s -> 3180.53s]  Oh, Monstro, you ain't got nothing.
[3180.53s -> 3182.53s]  You ain't got nothing, Burger Boy Mastro.
[3182.53s -> 3188.42s]  Oh, get hit
[3188.42s -> 3191.62s]  with a tooth. Get hit with a tooth.
[3191.62s -> 3200.76s]  That was lucky.
[3200.76s -> 3203.83s]  Alright. Is there more than one
[3203.83s -> 3205.83s]  secret room? There could be one right over here.
[3205.83s -> 3210.93s]  Maybe? No.
[3210.93s -> 3213.24s]  You know what? I am not messing around
[3213.24s -> 3215.24s]  anymore. I'm going right. I'm going there.
[3215.24s -> 3217.24s]  I'm not gonna do any more bowl
[3217.24s -> 3219.92s]  snip. Going to fight
[3219.92s -> 3221.92s]  whoever's in this room down here. Oh
[3221.92s -> 3226.47s]  my god. Book of Shadows.
[3226.47s -> 3228.71s]  Can say it a million times.
[3228.71s -> 3234.96s]  Well, I just...
[3234.96s -> 3236.96s]  Might as well go in here. I opened the damn door.
[3236.96s -> 3241.62s]  I'm gonna use it. And...
[3241.62s -> 3243.62s]  Doesn't this do something though? That's the book of Balaam.
[3243.62s -> 3248.42s]  There is no max damage in this
[3248.42s -> 3250.42s]  game? Well, isn't
[3250.42s -> 3252.42s]  that an indication of how much damage you do?
[3252.42s -> 3255.43s]  I thought that's what it was.
[3255.43s -> 3260.92s]  And... Two Greeds.
[3260.92s -> 3264.12s]  It's gotta be
[3264.12s -> 3266.12s]  two. They gotta have two of everything, huh?
[3266.12s -> 3268.12s]  It's like double mint gum.
[3268.12s -> 3270.12s]  Double... I don't even... Money doesn't
[3270.12s -> 3272.12s]  matter. That doesn't matter.
[3272.12s -> 3279.03s]  Double your pleasure. Double
[3279.03s -> 3281.03s]  your fun. That's a statement of a
[3281.03s -> 3283.03s]  great mint. Double mint gum.
[3283.03s -> 3286.04s]  I'm doing it. Here we
[3286.04s -> 3288.92s]  go. Kain versus
[3288.92s -> 3292.76s]  Isaac?
[3292.76s -> 3295.51s]  Ah! Ah! He's...
[3295.51s -> 3298.95s]  God.
[3298.95s -> 3300.95s]  I gotta utilize this as best I can.
[3300.95s -> 3302.95s]  Come on. Come on. Come on.
[3302.95s -> 3304.95s]  Come on. I gotta use this as best I can.
[3304.95s -> 3308.53s]  Come on! Okay.
[3308.53s -> 3311.16s]  Book of Shadows. Come on.
[3311.16s -> 3313.16s]  I got the power. I gotta be quiet now.
[3313.16s -> 3323.08s]  Or else I'm really not gonna do this.
[3323.08s -> 3325.08s]  Damn! God!
[3325.08s -> 3339.35s]  God! No!
[3339.35s -> 3341.35s]  God damn it!
[3341.35s -> 3344.87s]  Oh!
[3344.87s -> 3348.52s]  Oh!
[3348.52s -> 3353.17s]  Oh!
[3353.17s -> 3355.41s]  Oh!
[3355.41s -> 3358.87s]  Oh!
[3358.87s -> 3363.22s]  Oh!
[3363.22s -> 3365.78s]  Oh!
[3365.78s -> 3368.72s]  Oh!
[3368.72s -> 3370.72s]  And I gotta text.
[3370.72s -> 3374.18s]  Oh!
[3374.18s -> 3377.70s]  I can't believe that.
[3377.70s -> 3379.70s]  He had
[3379.70s -> 3382.96s]  no health.
[3382.96s -> 3385.27s]  He had zero
[3385.27s -> 3388.40s]  health.
[3388.40s -> 3390.40s]  I should have placed bombs.
[3390.40s -> 3393.22s]  I know. I just...
[3393.22s -> 3396.61s]  Oh!
[3396.61s -> 3398.79s]  Oh! I
[3398.79s -> 3401.28s]  was so close!
[3401.28s -> 3403.28s]  I was so close
[3403.28s -> 3405.28s]  to beating this... the entire
[3405.28s -> 3407.28s]  game. Like, that's the end of the entire
[3407.28s -> 3409.28s]  game of Wrath of the Lam.
[3409.28s -> 3411.28s]  And I didn't do it.
[3411.28s -> 3413.91s]  Well, at least I tried.
[3413.91s -> 3417.36s]  Yeah, if I got
[3417.36s -> 3419.36s]  the 20-20 hindsight,
[3419.36s -> 3421.36s]  if I had done what I should have done,
[3421.36s -> 3423.36s]  I didn't know it was gonna
[3423.36s -> 3426.76s]  be like that, though. Oh, well.
[3426.76s -> 3429.06s]  That's gonna be pretty funny
[3429.06s -> 3431.06s]  video.
[3431.06s -> 3433.06s]  Hey, here's a full playthrough of Binding of Isaac,
[3433.06s -> 3435.06s]  except for the very end when
[3435.06s -> 3437.06s]  I die when the boss has one health.
[3437.06s -> 3441.86s]  Oh, man.
[3441.86s -> 3447.62s]  The death animation started.
[3447.62s -> 3450.63s]  Oh. Well,
[3450.63s -> 3452.63s]  at least I tried.
