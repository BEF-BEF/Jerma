[15.07s -> 28.56s]  How do you do? How are you? Yeah.
[28.56s -> 31.56s]  We don't have to do a survival mode or anything.
[31.68s -> 40.05s]  I just want to go see the new arcade. We're in coin game now.
[44.10s -> 55.23s]  Did you take a lap around the room to calm down? Yeah, kind of.
[61.98s -> 68.77s]  So I paced a little bit. All right, let me get into here. This looks good.
[72.95s -> 80.12s]  That looks good. All right. So where's the new arcade? I'm in birthday mode.
[85.33s -> 96.59s]  I'm going to need to add this. Oh, there it is. Okay.
[97.78s -> 104.73s]  So anyone know where the new arcade is? I have my map, right?
[108.81s -> 114.77s]  You drive cars now or no, just not really. He really did get filtered.
[114.81s -> 118.65s]  No, I went through the filter and I passed through as clean water.
[119.01s -> 123.15s]  I got through it. I beat that boss. Go look at the, just go rewind, rewind.
[123.15s -> 134.85s]  I know you didn't believe it. I know you don't think it's real. I beat it. Uh,
[134.85s -> 141.79s]  okay. So I think it's the mall. I'm looking for the mall. Uh, yep.
[141.83s -> 147.75s]  Happy birthday. There it is. The mall. Oh shit. We're just going in the limo.
[150.46s -> 155.48s]  Cool. Let's go. Can you tell us please what liquid reflexes mean?
[157.36s -> 159.97s]  I, you're going to have to ask the person that said that. I don't know.
[160.50s -> 165.22s]  Whoever said that to you. I don't know. We made it. All right.
[165.22s -> 181.30s]  We made it to the mall. You said that that's, that's not provable. All right.
[181.30s -> 186.14s]  So here's the new area. Cool. You said it. You did. That's not proof.
[186.18s -> 190.50s]  That's not proof. Prove it. Then it was on this stream. You're taking,
[190.54s -> 192.30s]  talk about something I said, like two, three years ago,
[193.41s -> 196.93s]  like and you're taking it out of context. Now, what the heck?
[202.53s -> 210.08s]  Yeah. It was literally 32 minutes ago. What the, what the hell dude?
[212.89s -> 217.51s]  Ah, Gary, I'm sorry. I can do better than that.
[225.26s -> 229.18s]  Pirate pizza. Jerry's gourmet. Sammy's vacant.
[230.23s -> 246.04s]  Let's go sit there. Let's go. Can I buy jewelry? Oh,
[246.04s -> 260.71s]  I'm trying to take them. How do I get those? Can I buy anything here?
[263.54s -> 267.66s]  Ask for price, gold, fronts, iced, anything, custom rings.
[268.69s -> 281.36s]  Can I ask? Can I just say, hold on. Yeah. I can't just break it.
[282.73s -> 290.95s]  Arcade arcade castle. Let's go. There's apparently some new stuff.
[295.90s -> 315.69s]  I have 300 bucks. I didn't make it. You gotta go.
[315.69s -> 317.85s]  You gotta get the spot and just do only hundreds.
[319.75s -> 324.03s]  I'm going to say red is lined up right at the bottom. Let's go all the way green.
[324.90s -> 328.58s]  No, I'll get it. And I'll do every single one.
[331.85s -> 336.95s]  Red lined up right here at the bottom or the edge. Go that many green.
[337.19s -> 361.79s]  A little bit more. Am I aiming too high? Okay. Yeah. I'm aiming too high.
[376.76s -> 382.80s]  You can't use them. You can't say filter in here. All right. What was that?
[384.86s -> 393.18s]  Red lined up right here. All the way green. Maybe one yellow.
[404.24s -> 405.60s]  I'm going to get all fifties. Here we go.
[425.51s -> 428.63s]  Do the top armored course streamer right now. I might as well be playing it.
[429.90s -> 452.17s]  This is just as hard. It's it's inconsistent. I think you have to move with it.
[456.61s -> 467.77s]  I'll take a hundred points. That's fine. That's bad. Isn't it? Hey, all right.
[467.77s -> 469.21s]  That was fun. I was never good at ski ball.
[477.74s -> 491.82s]  Add a mech cockpit overlay. Can somebody just give me one that has opacity?
[497.15s -> 515.94s]  Oh, I'm good at this one. I'm not going to mess it up. I'll get it.
[528.21s -> 534.46s]  I'm my finger got crushed. Ow, my finger got crushed.
[541.79s -> 545.61s]  Can we put the, can we put the, all right, here's what I want.
[546.09s -> 550.75s]  I want, I want the, the crosshair in the middle.
[551.19s -> 554.79s]  And I want all the HUD information. I don't want like the guns on the side.
[555.97s -> 556.81s]  I want,
[556.93s -> 579.02s]  I'm walking around at a mech with all the little UI information. The game lagged.
[579.94s -> 594.04s]  You actually saw that happen. I'm seeing a lot of copiums, but it really did.
[607.48s -> 617.78s]  The hell's going on here. It's hard mode. Makes the game just way harder.
[623.39s -> 642.49s]  I got lucky there, but it worked. Shit.
[648.17s -> 693.10s]  I was so waiting for it to lag that I was in my own head. The lag,
[693.14s -> 697.18s]  even with the lag, I still, I had it. The lag,
[699.46s -> 702.86s]  I was going to scream something. I was going to say like, what the, but no,
[703.50s -> 712.22s]  let's chill. I ended up being fine. Almost clutched it. Yeah. Almost.
[713.26s -> 747.86s]  Not quite though. I get it. Clutched it. Feel good about that one.
[749.01s -> 761.11s]  How many tickets was it? Ooh, that's a lot. How many? 2000 tickets. Holy shit.
[761.11s -> 770.41s]  That's a lot. What did I get for this one? 162. That's not bad. All right.
[770.41s -> 778.23s]  What is this? So this is like a coin thing. Coin pusher. All right.
[778.23s -> 784.98s]  What am I looking for? I want, um, yeah, I want 120 coins.
[789.10s -> 793.06s]  All right. I have 120. So what am I trying to do here?
[793.62s -> 803.40s]  I'm trying to just drop stuff. You got it. Load it up.
[810.22s -> 831.22s]  The blue are worth a hundred. So what do I get for points? All right.
[831.22s -> 835.76s]  Stomp the mermaids space. What is it? How do I get the bonus?
[847.15s -> 851.03s]  Play the one with the ball. I'll play the one with the ball. Give me one sec.
[852.31s -> 868.18s]  This is your best content. 50. I'm going for the,
[868.18s -> 870.50s]  I'm going with the 50 right here. It's a hundred tickets, right?
[873.80s -> 882.04s]  I don't have to pick these up, right? There we go. I got 50 points.
[884.24s -> 886.48s]  I tried it. I'm going to try to get one of the hundreds. This one's the closest.
[886.64s -> 916.34s]  We're going to spam over here. Hundred incoming. Here it is. Oh shit.
[916.34s -> 925.83s]  I'm out of money. Oh, it's my birthday. I'll be all right. It's a little bit loud.
[934.66s -> 938.96s]  Uh, I'll take care of that. Give me one sec. That should be better.
[944.15s -> 951.90s]  All right. Let's skillfully do this now. Happy birthday. Hey, thanks.
[961.16s -> 974.38s]  Just want the a hundred and I'm good. Just dangling. Come on. Wait, see,
[974.38s -> 982.43s]  stop. Oh, I get it. Maybe if I get five points in,
[985.10s -> 988.95s]  let's see what happens when that five goes in, will it move five paces?
[991.18s -> 1002.84s]  Come on, come on. All right. I need one more five. That'll do it right here.
[1006.89s -> 1019.41s]  That's two fives, but Oh, that's unfortunate.
[1029.42s -> 1032.80s]  All right. That five right there. That'll do it. Don't drop the 10,
[1032.80s -> 1043.45s]  drop the five right in this corner. Watch this. There it is. All right. Bonus.
[1044.73s -> 1052.81s]  I got a 237 tickets. Did you get the mech yet? Uh, there's one,
[1052.89s -> 1057.37s]  I have one in the mods have sent me, but that's more like,
[1058.33s -> 1080.88s]  I want like a spaceship. Look, look at all the tickets. I'm getting another bonus.
[1082.18s -> 1092.24s]  Whoa. 800 tickets. Oh, you've got 800 tickets there.
[1093.59s -> 1104.15s]  Oh, give it a spin. Oh, a thousand tickets. Yeah.
[1109.70s -> 1112.79s]  Okay. I know this one. I'm good at this one.
[1124.91s -> 1131.42s]  Let it go around once. Hmm. They may have patched this.
[1135.24s -> 1154.46s]  It's possible. This was patched. Shit. Shit. Shit.
[1158.82s -> 1175.30s]  Shit. Shit. Dude, dude, dude, I just,
[1175.34s -> 1182.30s]  I just got 385 tickets on that machine. Do you want to hang out? Hey, Hey,
[1184.06s -> 1184.82s]  Hey, do you want to hang out with me?
[1184.82s -> 1202.18s]  I just got 400 tickets on the machine to look. Don't for it again. Oh,
[1202.18s -> 1212.70s]  almost. Oh, Hey, two to eight, two in a row.
[1219.06s -> 1224.34s]  Hold on a second. This is, this is a kind of like, what is this?
[1225.75s -> 1229.82s]  Is this from fallout? Like what is this even from? What game is this from?
[1229.98s -> 1248.11s]  Hold on. Okay. There is a mask in here, so that's good. Okay.
[1250.49s -> 1261.49s]  So now here we go. What even is this from?
[1278.90s -> 1283.03s]  I have to act like a spacecraft, right? This is, this is mech warrior.
[1283.03s -> 1290.66s]  Let's go really, really organic limbs that this mech has weird.
[1293.40s -> 1305.30s]  It's not lined up that better. Shit.
[1307.01s -> 1310.09s]  Add a bunch of robot sounds in the background. Yeah, that has to be there.
[1321.82s -> 1326.14s]  Robot walking sound effects, giant robot walking. Oh, let me,
[1326.30s -> 1349.07s]  this might be loud. Hold on. The robot mic. Can I even do that here?
[1349.07s -> 1366.55s]  Hold on. Does this, uh, does this work? Does this work? How are we doing? Okay.
[1367.93s -> 1383.21s]  Okay. Let me just turn it around. Okay. Let's go for it. This one looks good.
[1389.82s -> 1393.96s]  It looks okay. Uh, now I will play this one.
[1396.04s -> 1401.48s]  We need tickets, tickets, tickets, tickets. Tickets.
[1410.88s -> 1415.42s]  Almost, almost a hundred. One more, one more, one more.
[1418.70s -> 1428.55s]  Almost a hundred. Is it loud? Oh, it is loud. Why is it so loud?
[1432.76s -> 1440.52s]  How did that get so loud? Is it better?
[1469.26s -> 1476.99s]  Candy, do you guys have Charleston shoes?
[1485.74s -> 1497.66s]  I'm not going to be able to see you. Okay. Was it really that loud?
[1499.12s -> 1510.46s]  That looked like it was kind of loud. Hopefully it wasn't too bad. It was okay.
[1513.73s -> 1518.88s]  Pick those up. Those are my tickets. It was incomprehensible.
[1521.91s -> 1531.08s]  What is this one? Oh, it's one of these. I know how to play these.
[1531.08s -> 1540.02s]  You have to like push them down, right? Oh, tickets to your right.
[1544.65s -> 1558.46s]  There's a thousand tickets on the ground where I don't see them. Oh, there they are.
[1564.05s -> 1576.18s]  That's not a thousand. That was 40. I want to get that cow.
[1576.54s -> 1594.26s]  There's more in there. Ooh, tickets. I want this cow. I've played these though.
[1594.26s -> 1597.06s]  You have to, you don't try to go for the grab. You try to push it over.
[1598.33s -> 1601.80s]  You don't actually want to pick it up. All right, there we go. That's good.
[1601.80s -> 1611.77s]  That's good. That's actually a big deal. Okay. Now we go from the behind here.
[1612.63s -> 1616.40s]  I just want to kind of nudge it. I don't want to pick it up.
[1618.99s -> 1624.79s]  Actually, it might be fine. I definitely got it. There it is.
[1626.85s -> 1637.54s]  I got the cow. Nice. Let me look at it.
[1647.92s -> 1651.59s]  I'd like to sell this for more coins.
[1656.79s -> 1662.70s]  I played this one before. This one's fun. Put it back in the machine.
[1663.02s -> 1666.15s]  I know there's another one. Oh, yes.
[1666.15s -> 1669.31s]  A hundred percent. This is the worst machine in the Intel.
[1669.31s -> 1682.90s]  I almost said casino. Woo. Woo. Woo. Woo. Woo.
[1693.47s -> 1717.67s]  What? Oh, shit. It lagged.
[1717.67s -> 1752.30s]  I want those headphones. Yay. Headphones.
[1756.59s -> 1761.65s]  I'll take that. I can definitely sell these for a lot of money.
[1765.82s -> 1768.18s]  All right. What's this one?
[1768.18s -> 1776.50s]  Ticket. Oh, I think you get tickets on your forty eight hundred.
[1781.77s -> 1783.93s]  I just a moment. What do you mean? Moment.
[1784.77s -> 1789.18s]  And they remove those.
[1789.18s -> 1796.42s]  I thought they got rid of moments.
[1796.42s -> 1798.47s]  Let me get the mega jackpot.
[1798.47s -> 1807.95s]  I'll take mystery ball to if he's good.
[1807.95s -> 1809.03s]  They didn't remove them yet.
[1809.03s -> 1818.11s]  Oh, I see. I just got the jackpot.
[1818.11s -> 1822.03s]  Oh, shit. Nice. OK.
[1822.03s -> 1829.26s]  I still have two balls.
[1829.26s -> 1831.22s]  Give us moments before they remove them.
[1834.03s -> 1837.90s]  I just wait. Bonus round.
[1837.90s -> 1840.76s]  I want that mega jackpot.
[1840.76s -> 1847.73s]  All right.
[1849.91s -> 1851.95s]  Yoshi, get in there.
[1851.95s -> 1855.34s]  I got another bonus round.
[1855.34s -> 1866.61s]  Yay. Yay. I think I did it.
[1866.61s -> 1867.53s]  That was fun.
[1867.53s -> 1869.77s]  That required no skill at all.
[1869.77s -> 1875.82s]  I just watched. Perfect game.
[1875.82s -> 1878.03s]  All right. There's another room over here.
[1878.03s -> 1880.80s]  I think there's a couple more games that we have not seen.
[1883.11s -> 1887.54s]  Otto. Oh, it's called Octo Swirl.
[1887.74s -> 1895.52s]  How does this one work?
[1895.52s -> 1899.09s]  Ah, right. I always hated these.
[1900.39s -> 1904.97s]  He's always felt so particular.
[1904.97s -> 1910.77s]  And I'll take 300 tickets, though.
[1910.77s -> 1921.37s]  All right. One more.
[1921.37s -> 1922.93s]  A jackpot is going to be really hard to hit.
[1922.93s -> 1930.34s]  2000. Pretty good.
[1930.34s -> 1935.10s]  Oh, there's a Halloween one over here.
[1935.10s -> 1936.87s]  Pumpkin pusher.
[1936.87s -> 1939.02s]  Ah, here it is.
[1939.02s -> 1941.20s]  Here it is.
[1941.20s -> 1946.78s]  This is probably the most popular thing in any arcade.
[1955.14s -> 1955.42s]  All right.
[1955.42s -> 1957.78s]  So the whole thing with this, you have to collect these pumpkin balls.
[1964.21s -> 1967.62s]  I've never heard of this one.
[1968.86s -> 1970.74s]  There are different things in different arcades.
[1970.74s -> 1973.02s]  There's a lot of different variety here.
[1973.02s -> 1974.70s]  I mean, I don't really go to the arcade that frequently,
[1974.70s -> 1977.99s]  but every time I've gone to the arcade, which is probably two or three times
[1977.99s -> 1982.90s]  in the last year or two, these were occupied.
[1982.94s -> 1990.70s]  All of them. These were all occupied.
[1990.70s -> 1991.79s]  What I get.
[1991.79s -> 2000.98s]  OK, I need to get I want another pumpkin.
[2000.98s -> 2004.24s]  All right. I want I need to get at least a few of those in there.
[2004.60s -> 2011.22s]  It's all about just spamming.
[2011.22s -> 2014.85s]  It looks like there's skill here, but it's just just throw dice in the air.
[2016.94s -> 2018.94s]  You can guide it a little. Not really.
[2020.50s -> 2021.30s]  All right. There's another one.
[2021.30s -> 2029.74s]  I think when you get to a few more, it should be the bonus of the pumpkin.
[2029.74s -> 2032.06s]  Yeah. You want to try to get in the middle there.
[2032.06s -> 2037.14s]  You can because that puts another pumpkin ball in.
[2037.76s -> 2040.04s]  Or if you do that, it just shoots other little balls in.
[2040.81s -> 2043.11s]  What's the what is it? Yellow.
[2043.11s -> 2045.82s]  Can't read. What is this going to do?
[2045.82s -> 2049.01s]  Oh, OK. How's my skin doing?
[2049.01s -> 2050.53s]  It's a it's very hydrated.
[2050.53s -> 2061.48s]  It's very healthy. All stuck.
[2061.48s -> 2064.72s]  All right. Here we go. Here comes one.
[2064.72s -> 2065.88s]  This is the stuck one. All right.
[2065.88s -> 2069.03s]  Push it down. Let's go.
[2069.03s -> 2071.47s]  I'll take another yellow.
[2071.47s -> 2080.46s]  Oh, it's OK.
[2080.46s -> 2086.65s]  All right. Get it down there.
[2086.65s -> 2092.37s]  I have two more credits.
[2092.37s -> 2093.05s]  All right.
[2093.05s -> 2095.35s]  Oh, that's all right.
[2095.35s -> 2098.24s]  I keep going.
[2098.24s -> 2100.28s]  What do you think? Should I just try to get as many of these as I can?
[2106.74s -> 2112.03s]  Yeah, we got to get the bonus. We have to.
[2112.03s -> 2119.76s]  I got to get the mega jackpot.
[2119.76s -> 2124.92s]  I got to get more orange balls.
[2124.92s -> 2126.28s]  So just wait till they are in the middle.
[2126.28s -> 2129.62s]  That's made the most sense.
[2129.62s -> 2131.90s]  You should do one more AC boss before bed.
[2133.33s -> 2137.61s]  That was a good idea.
[2137.61s -> 2140.65s]  Do you understand how long I was biting my tongue,
[2141.17s -> 2143.53s]  desperately wanting to just scream about the game?
[2143.53s -> 2146.67s]  And I knew that I was up against that bet.
[2146.67s -> 2150.87s]  So that kept me that kept my cool for a long time.
[2154.74s -> 2157.46s]  We should do that every single time
[2157.46s -> 2167.09s]  because that that keeps me honest.
[2167.09s -> 2168.77s]  Try it again with the mech overlay.
[2168.77s -> 2171.17s]  You want to put the mech overlay on top of the mech overlay
[2177.44s -> 2179.54s]  or was it the mega jackpot?
[2188.22s -> 2188.78s]  What did I say?
[2188.78s -> 2191.43s]  Has any human beaten this game yet?
[2191.43s -> 2193.83s]  And here's the thing I know that people have.
[2194.11s -> 2196.65s]  Look at this.
[2196.65s -> 2199.49s]  What's going on here? Look at this.
[2199.49s -> 2201.07s]  Look at this.
[2201.07s -> 2204.70s]  Oh, something's happening.
[2204.70s -> 2207.29s]  Did I do it?
[2207.49s -> 2216.86s]  It's pumpkin time.
[2216.86s -> 2226.04s]  Come on. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[2226.04s -> 2231.65s]  That's two balls and then a three going in.
[2231.65s -> 2234.77s]  All right. This is that was cool.
[2234.77s -> 2240.05s]  You broke the machine.
[2240.05s -> 2241.37s]  All right. Look at the yellow.
[2241.37s -> 2245.22s]  Yellow is 200.
[2245.22s -> 2248.07s]  Now what? Just fill them all up.
[2248.07s -> 2251.79s]  What happens if I get yellow again?
[2251.79s -> 2253.03s]  Oh, I got it. OK.
[2253.03s -> 2263.99s]  It was 250.
[2263.99s -> 2265.91s]  So if you fill one all the way to the top.
[2265.91s -> 2268.15s]  Oh, it's orange is the one I want.
[2268.15s -> 2269.81s]  We got a pumpkin party, though.
[2269.81s -> 2279.04s]  Hey, guys, we've got a pumpkin party.
[2279.04s -> 2291.30s]  Nobody even came to my birthday party.
[2291.30s -> 2293.02s]  I like this one. This one's fun.
[2293.02s -> 2295.46s]  You always go to 5000 every time.
[2309.62s -> 2312.02s]  All right. We're going to do 5000 three times in a row.
[2312.02s -> 2315.20s]  This is kid roulette. It really is.
[2315.20s -> 2317.40s]  I had one of these in a local arcade.
[2318.43s -> 2321.81s]  And I'm telling you right now,
[2321.81s -> 2324.41s]  I would just sit there and it'd be like, oh, come on, come on.
[2324.81s -> 2328.82s]  It's going to be green this time.
[2328.82s -> 2331.26s]  I may as well have had a cigar in my mouth just sitting there.
[2333.08s -> 2335.24s]  No, no, no. Everybody's got to go blue
[2335.60s -> 2337.60s]  or it's going to fuck it up for everybody here.
[2338.53s -> 2344.72s]  Everybody go blue.
[2344.72s -> 2348.72s]  Actually, I think in the old ones you could pick every color if you wanted to.
[2348.72s -> 2353.02s]  It just was a credit.
[2353.02s -> 2355.06s]  So you could effectively do every single one.
[2355.60s -> 2361.10s]  And I think just light up the whole thing.
[2361.10s -> 2367.92s]  Little green.
[2367.92s -> 2376.54s]  It had a similar soundtrack to this, too.
[2376.54s -> 2382.12s]  There it is. Oh, crap for kids.
[2395.38s -> 2400.30s]  Just have white come up once.
[2400.30s -> 2403.54s]  Remember, if you don't give us a baby green character, we will riot.
[2411.41s -> 2414.25s]  I mean, but you want a baby green.
[2420.67s -> 2430.04s]  Oh, OK. I feel like that's the movie deal that I got.
[2431.00s -> 2439.84s]  And I hate it.
[2439.84s -> 2441.32s]  No, we don't want you to be Mr.
[2441.32s -> 2443.32s]  Greens. We want you to be Mr.
[2443.32s -> 2445.82s]  Greens as a six year old.
[2449.07s -> 2452.51s]  Oh, OK. OK, I guess.
[2459.14s -> 2461.04s]  No, we don't want Bugleberry.
[2461.04s -> 2465.26s]  We want Bugleberry in college.
[2465.26s -> 2468.40s]  Oh, OK.
[2468.40s -> 2479.00s]  I don't really want to.
[2479.00s -> 2485.22s]  That sounds way better.
[2485.22s -> 2490.84s]  Oh, Bugleberry's backstory.
[2505.86s -> 2509.82s]  All right. I'm I'm walking.
[2509.82s -> 2511.34s]  Chat gets to press a button as a treat.
[2511.34s -> 2513.12s]  All right. Which one?
[2513.12s -> 2515.31s]  Which one you want to press?
[2515.31s -> 2519.18s]  Red, green, blue, yellow or white?
[2519.18s -> 2534.18s]  Which one? Better call Bugleberry.
[2538.82s -> 2543.18s]  How's it looking?
[2543.18s -> 2544.18s]  You're all saying white.
[2544.18s -> 2547.50s]  So it's I pressed yellow and I didn't mean to do that.
[2547.50s -> 2548.74s]  I clicked back in the window.
[2548.74s -> 2549.82s]  So hopefully it's not white.
[2549.82s -> 2551.34s]  If it is, I'm going to leave.
[2551.34s -> 2557.68s]  It's going to be sad.
[2557.68s -> 2565.67s]  All right. We all lose. So who cares?
[2565.67s -> 2567.71s]  All right. One more white for chat.
[2569.91s -> 2584.46s]  And then we're going to play the other game.
[2584.46s -> 2588.98s]  What did I say earlier? Cut the crap.
[2588.98s -> 2593.70s]  Oh, this one's fun, too.
[2593.70s -> 2613.97s]  I love this one.
[2613.97s -> 2615.33s]  Thousand. All right.
[2615.33s -> 2616.61s]  Can I? This is free.
[2616.61s -> 2628.47s]  Thousand tickets.
[2628.47s -> 2635.56s]  All right. I'm going to get 10,000 tickets next to me earlier.
[2647.66s -> 2649.26s]  The bonus is random.
[2649.26s -> 2660.22s]  That's weird. 1392.
[2660.22s -> 2661.99s]  Shit. You got to be.
[2661.99s -> 2667.50s]  I got to be more impressive than this.
[2667.50s -> 2670.73s]  Ah, where's Dizzy Bird?
[2670.73s -> 2674.34s]  I will play at least 30 games of Dizzy Bird before I leave.
[2679.38s -> 2683.85s]  All right. I promise I will play at least 40 games of Dizzy Bird
[2683.97s -> 2690.42s]  before I am done with the arcade.
[2690.42s -> 2691.94s]  That's a realistic number.
[2691.94s -> 2699.78s]  And that's one that I know I can hit.
[2699.78s -> 2702.21s]  Another 1400.
[2702.21s -> 2704.25s]  Dude, what does your stream title mean half the time?
[2705.18s -> 2707.46s]  I don't know, because I make a stream title
[2708.30s -> 2711.38s]  and then I have that window is over here and it's closed off.
[2712.55s -> 2715.28s]  And then my moderators take turns.
[2715.64s -> 2718.45s]  You're rating me in my title.
[2718.45s -> 2727.62s]  So I have no idea what it says right now.
[2727.62s -> 2735.56s]  What does it say now?
[2735.56s -> 2738.26s]  What does it say?
[2738.26s -> 2741.26s]  It's an automatic coin pusher game.
[2741.26s -> 2744.61s]  Pocket change at 50 percent.
[2745.26s -> 2746.66s]  Pocket change at 30 percent.
[2746.66s -> 2747.86s]  No tickets remaining.
[2747.86s -> 2752.89s]  I'm sorry, Raven.
[2752.89s -> 2755.10s]  Who's Raven?
[2755.10s -> 2755.98s]  Is that from Armored Core?
[2755.98s -> 2768.29s]  Oh, it's one of the Armored Core characters.
[2768.29s -> 2771.15s]  It's you.
[2771.15s -> 2778.98s]  Yeah, but it's me.
[2781.10s -> 2783.38s]  It's like you didn't even play Armored Core.
[2783.42s -> 2787.30s]  I you just saw me beat the hottest boss in the game.
[2791.61s -> 2810.55s]  Somebody else was playing.
[2810.55s -> 2813.27s]  Hey, you got what you wanted out of that.
[2813.27s -> 2816.94s]  You got at least three or four.
[2821.27s -> 2823.95s]  And then I complained about From Software for like 15 straight minutes.
[2831.14s -> 2836.47s]  You got what you wanted.
[2836.47s -> 2837.27s]  Actually, no, I didn't.
[2837.27s -> 2840.56s]  I didn't complain about From Software.
[2840.56s -> 2841.96s]  I don't think I complained very much at all.
[2841.96s -> 2847.85s]  Did I complain? Not really.
[2847.85s -> 2849.13s]  I don't think it was a complaint.
[2859.98s -> 2861.22s]  Is he talking to us?
[2861.22s -> 2866.49s]  No, no. The person behind you.
[2866.49s -> 2867.13s]  All right. One more.
[2867.13s -> 2870.34s]  And I'm going to do that.
[2870.62s -> 2883.07s]  What's it called? One more.
[2883.07s -> 2883.87s]  There we go. All right.
[2883.87s -> 2885.50s]  Now I can leave.
[2885.50s -> 2892.47s]  Probably about 10K, right?
[2892.47s -> 2893.83s]  Give the controller back to your wife.
[2893.83s -> 2896.71s]  She's way better at video games than you and has plus two RIS.
[2905.58s -> 2907.57s]  That's like five, six thousand.
[2907.57s -> 2911.14s]  Plus two RIS.
[2911.14s -> 2912.58s]  I didn't even see this thing.
[2912.58s -> 2914.46s]  What is this? I'm playing it.
[2914.46s -> 2917.14s]  Wait, there's other stuff here.
[2917.14s -> 2919.66s]  There's a ton of other shit here.
[2919.66s -> 2924.19s]  It's not time to go to Dizzy Bird yet.
[2924.19s -> 2950.90s]  I hate this one, but I'll play it.
[2950.90s -> 2951.90s]  I had it. I had it.
[2951.90s -> 2956.82s]  If it didn't freeze, if it didn't freeze, I had it freeze.
[2956.82s -> 2986.91s]  Messed it up.
[2986.91s -> 2996.56s]  I think that's when you walk away from this one.
[2996.56s -> 2999.97s]  Oh, was it basketball in the original game?
[2999.97s -> 3005.02s]  I don't remember that.
[3005.02s -> 3022.47s]  Let's do it.
[3022.51s -> 3025.91s]  Everybody knows the only real way to play this game is you
[3025.91s -> 3029.30s]  and two other friends just pick up all of them at the same time.
[3029.62s -> 3036.19s]  And then everybody just kind of drops them over there at the same time.
[3040.26s -> 3048.99s]  I got the bonus round, though.
[3048.99s -> 3051.36s]  That's hard. Six thousand tickets.
[3052.38s -> 3063.31s]  No, that's a this is one to play.
[3063.67s -> 3067.10s]  And then you're done. You don't play it again.
[3067.10s -> 3069.27s]  This one has a similar mindset to.
[3069.27s -> 3093.48s]  I wonder how does this work?
[3093.48s -> 3096.32s]  Oh, you have to hit the right.
[3096.32s -> 3123.33s]  I forgot about the hell.
[3123.33s -> 3125.37s]  I got the exact same score.
[3125.57s -> 3131.62s]  Quagmire.
[3134.39s -> 3173.04s]  I wish the trajectory on this one.
[3173.04s -> 3184.53s]  That was pretty good.
[3184.53s -> 3185.81s]  I think you play against another player.
[3185.81s -> 3186.97s]  All right, let's kick this person's ass.
[3196.19s -> 3197.03s]  I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
[3197.03s -> 3216.31s]  Let's play. Let's play.
[3216.31s -> 3217.79s]  Oh, don't laugh at that.
[3217.79s -> 3241.55s]  Oh, it's not going to tell you're trying really hard because I am, too.
[3260.18s -> 3266.09s]  Get it. Why did you get so good all of a sudden?
[3285.58s -> 3288.82s]  Dude, how are you still home?
[3288.82s -> 3299.83s]  I still in this.
[3299.83s -> 3315.70s]  What is going on?
[3315.70s -> 3318.14s]  We're going to hit the enrage timer and the air is going to turn off.
[3318.26s -> 3331.47s]  OK, good.
[3331.47s -> 3337.98s]  I think you can actually hit that, by the way.
[3337.98s -> 3341.60s]  Can't you tune the game to make it so so people don't just sit around,
[3342.43s -> 3349.06s]  just hit it back and forth all day?
[3349.06s -> 3352.91s]  Oh, that's right. You can buy scratch tickets.
[3352.91s -> 3354.83s]  I'll do a little. I'll do a few scratch tickets.
[3354.83s -> 3361.08s]  Why not? After we do this.
[3361.08s -> 3362.59s]  OK, that was good.
[3362.59s -> 3370.79s]  Oh, my God.
[3370.79s -> 3373.66s]  Do not come back and beat me.
[3382.98s -> 3383.54s]  What do you play?
[3383.54s -> 3385.90s]  This person got bored.
[3385.90s -> 3390.69s]  Is it to five or to seven?
[3390.69s -> 3392.66s]  Oh, I win.
[3392.66s -> 3399.30s]  Nice. 400. That's pretty good.
[3399.30s -> 3400.82s]  Have I played this one? Pile?
[3400.82s -> 3403.60s]  Does this one work?
[3403.60s -> 3413.08s]  Pile. Holy.
[3413.12s -> 3418.85s]  That's weird. This is weird.
[3418.85s -> 3431.22s]  This thing's very floaty.
[3431.22s -> 3437.56s]  OK, always start in the middle.
[3437.56s -> 3440.67s]  I got to get something on the left side, slightly on the left edge.
[3446.48s -> 3449.38s]  How was I ever supposed to do that?
[3449.38s -> 3450.26s]  Do it again. I get it now.
[3450.26s -> 3454.14s]  This feels like a jump scare is going to pop out any second.
[3460.35s -> 3461.67s]  All right. Now I get it.
[3461.67s -> 3462.67s]  I want to get at least.
[3462.67s -> 3469.48s]  Oh, that's kind of bad.
[3469.48s -> 3477.74s]  Hmm. It's OK.
[3477.74s -> 3485.62s]  OK, this last two were rough, but I'm good.
[3485.62s -> 3487.70s]  Hmm. A little too much on the left side.
[3492.66s -> 3503.94s]  Oh, that's bad.
[3503.94s -> 3509.79s]  I guess way too hard.
[3509.79s -> 3516.06s]  I guess too hard.
[3516.06s -> 3519.66s]  Well, I got all these saying spaghetti and garlic bread.
[3520.86s -> 3525.11s]  Oh, that sounds amazing.
[3525.11s -> 3528.58s]  Yeah, that sounds that that sounds like a great dinner.
[3530.02s -> 3541.31s]  Is that what we're doing?
[3541.31s -> 3542.47s]  I just I just beat it.
[3542.47s -> 3551.82s]  I'm done. Get that bonus right in the middle.
[3551.82s -> 3555.71s]  Do it. Do it.
[3555.71s -> 3570.66s]  Oh, what just happened?
[3570.66s -> 3571.50s]  Right in the middle.
[3571.50s -> 3580.63s]  Yeah, that's not a small amount of tickets.
[3580.63s -> 3585.20s]  That's actually really good.
[3585.20s -> 3592.20s]  All right. Snowball battle.
[3592.20s -> 3594.18s]  Get ready.
[3594.18s -> 3611.60s]  Oh, it's space invaders.
[3611.60s -> 3615.68s]  I get me out of this.
[3615.68s -> 3618.60s]  This always happens at any arcade I've ever gone to that has this cabinet.
[3619.74s -> 3621.90s]  Everybody points at it and everybody does like the
[3622.86s -> 3624.98s]  everybody has their mouth open pointing at space invaders.
[3625.38s -> 3627.26s]  One person puts a coin in to play it.
[3627.26s -> 3629.30s]  They die one time and walk away from the machine
[3629.30s -> 3636.55s]  because they don't want to play it a second time.
[3636.55s -> 3639.23s]  You realize, oh, I went, I've got I got two more lives.
[3640.39s -> 3643.79s]  Oh, anybody want to jump in?
[3643.79s -> 3646.58s]  It's like, no, not really.
[3646.58s -> 3664.01s]  All right, well, dude, I played the punch out arcade machine
[3668.34s -> 3670.62s]  and I was so bad at it.
[3670.62s -> 3675.07s]  I was I told I told everybody, oh, you guys, I'm so good to punch out.
[3675.07s -> 3676.95s]  Punch out my game.
[3676.95s -> 3679.35s]  The arcade version is so hard.
[3679.35s -> 3683.01s]  It's so much harder.
[3683.05s -> 3688.93s]  I just look like a total dickhead because I see the punch out arcade machine.
[3688.93s -> 3689.89s]  I'm going, that's awesome.
[3689.89s -> 3692.69s]  I punch out for NES, punch out for Super Nintendo, punch out for the Wii.
[3692.89s -> 3695.01s]  These are my games. I love them.
[3695.01s -> 3698.53s]  I could right now open up the Super Nintendo punch out
[3699.05s -> 3702.85s]  and not get hit one time, at least through all the three major circuits.
[3703.49s -> 3705.09s]  I could do it right now.
[3705.09s -> 3705.89s]  You know how I know that?
[3705.89s -> 3708.29s]  Because I did it like four days ago on the couch.
[3710.19s -> 3711.35s]  Do it right now.
[3711.35s -> 3721.51s]  That's not. No, I just know I can prove it.
[3721.51s -> 3725.05s]  Maybe I'll prove it next time I stream.
[3725.05s -> 3725.93s]  Maybe not. OK, maybe not.
[3725.93s -> 3728.45s]  No damage, but I won't I won't be knocked down once.
[3729.15s -> 3731.87s]  In the first three, like beating the regular game.
[3732.69s -> 3735.61s]  The special circuit is very hard.
[3748.57s -> 3752.47s]  That's a lot less impressive.
[3752.47s -> 3756.54s]  All right. So let me let me let me bait you guys with like a really awesome
[3756.54s -> 3758.80s]  potential gamer thing.
[3758.80s -> 3761.84s]  Get everybody excited and then change the rules right before it happens
[3761.84s -> 3766.64s]  to something that's moderately, slightly, intermediately impressive.
[3768.71s -> 3773.30s]  I'll take it. All right.
[3773.30s -> 3776.44s]  Am I missing anything that I didn't play?
[3776.44s -> 3778.76s]  Because it's time to go to dizzy, dizzy bird.
[3780.18s -> 3782.55s]  This game sucks. I hate this one.
[3782.55s -> 3786.07s]  In the regular arcade, I hate it, too.
[3786.07s -> 3789.52s]  Well, what is anything else in the mall?
[3789.52s -> 3796.38s]  This is all new content.
[3796.38s -> 3798.78s]  Candy. Can I actually use it?
[3798.78s -> 3816.12s]  Oh, you can. Oh, eat them.
[3816.12s -> 3828.35s]  Nice. Excuse me, sir.
[3828.35s -> 3829.43s]  What are you doing over there?
[3829.43s -> 3833.10s]  Fuck up. I'm making my own coin pusher.
[3854.82s -> 3862.78s]  Those are some stale jelly beans.
[3862.78s -> 3870.98s]  Gooey bears.
[3870.98s -> 3877.73s]  Gummy bears are not supposed to crunch.
[3877.73s -> 3884.52s]  Oh, here we go. Jawbreakers.
[3884.52s -> 3886.97s]  Oh, that hurts to hear.
[3886.97s -> 3889.34s]  That hurts to think about somebody doing that.
[3894.79s -> 3900.13s]  I buy new shoes.
[3900.13s -> 3907.18s]  What do you got? I play.
[3907.18s -> 3911.47s]  I can't shoot into the hoop.
[3911.47s -> 3920.45s]  Yes, I can.
[3920.45s -> 3923.02s]  You ignored the spiral game.
[3923.02s -> 3926.58s]  Oh, you mean this one over here?
[3926.58s -> 3935.74s]  I did. You're right.
[3935.74s -> 3940.58s]  Oh, first try.
[3940.58s -> 3941.10s]  I just beat it.
[3941.10s -> 3942.14s]  I don't do I need to play it again?
[3942.14s -> 3954.00s]  Not really.
[3954.00s -> 3959.42s]  It's another one, right?
[3959.42s -> 3961.82s]  You know what? I want to I want to play mini golf.
[3962.77s -> 3965.10s]  Is there a good mini golf game?
[3965.10s -> 3967.49s]  No bells and whistles. No bullshit.
[3967.49s -> 3973.43s]  Just mini golf.
[3973.43s -> 3977.13s]  There's a few.
[3977.13s -> 3979.41s]  I just want to play a standard mini golf course.
[3988.06s -> 3990.46s]  Golf it. Golf with friends.
[3990.46s -> 3993.82s]  I feel like I'm thinking back in the Super Nintendo N64 days.
[4002.18s -> 4004.08s]  Scratch tickets.
[4004.08s -> 4006.88s]  Oh, yeah. Let's go.
[4006.88s -> 4012.30s]  All right. I have.
[4012.30s -> 4016.93s]  All right. We're going to get a few of these.
[4016.93s -> 4026.36s]  And then we're taking this to Dizzy Bird.
[4026.36s -> 4036.98s]  Did I just buy? Where are they?
[4036.98s -> 4038.90s]  I got scammed.
[4038.90s -> 4049.84s]  No, I didn't. Let's scratch these.
[4049.84s -> 4052.20s]  And then I'm going to play 40 games of Dizzy Bird.
[4062.22s -> 4063.50s]  All right. Here we go.
[4063.50s -> 4068.46s]  Reveal three symbols.
[4068.46s -> 4073.88s]  Match three to win the fish.
[4073.88s -> 4076.00s]  All right. If I get one more four, it's 25, which I don't want.
[4077.26s -> 4086.27s]  I got my money back. Whatever.
[4086.27s -> 4087.43s]  All right. OK.
[4087.43s -> 4089.15s]  Oh, give me another car.
[4089.15s -> 4094.16s]  No, don't give me one.
[4094.16s -> 4102.86s]  Stop before it's too late.
[4102.86s -> 4108.61s]  I don't have any money left, so it is too late.
[4108.61s -> 4109.89s]  I'll take my money back here.
[4109.89s -> 4116.58s]  Give me another four.
[4116.58s -> 4117.82s]  Oh, no.
[4117.82s -> 4135.96s]  There better not be a one right here.
[4135.96s -> 4142.09s]  Wait, anything else in the mall?
[4142.09s -> 4143.05s]  Islandville Cinema.
[4143.05s -> 4147.32s]  I wonder if you can watch movies eventually.
[4147.32s -> 4148.16s]  That'd be kind of fun.
[4148.16s -> 4154.58s]  Credit union.
[4154.58s -> 4156.97s]  Wasn't there a food court or something?
[4167.51s -> 4168.69s]  How much is this?
[4168.69s -> 4170.77s]  All right. Make my wish.
[4170.77s -> 4173.85s]  Aim ramp at Zolbot's mouth.
[4174.60s -> 4177.63s]  Press red button to drop coin.
[4177.63s -> 4182.28s]  I got it.
[4182.28s -> 4188.36s]  Oh, is this? Did I win?
[4188.36s -> 4197.78s]  Wait, what did I just do?
[4197.78s -> 4198.54s]  What did you wish for?
[4198.54s -> 4206.85s]  I don't know. Nothing.
[4206.85s -> 4208.38s]  OK, I'll get it right this time.
[4208.38s -> 4210.10s]  All right. Here's my wish.
[4210.10s -> 4231.69s]  I have to hold it while I make my wish.
[4231.69s -> 4233.93s]  What does it say in the back?
[4233.93s -> 4235.77s]  Your wish is granted to.
[4235.97s -> 4236.73s]  Oh, nice.
[4236.73s -> 4255.74s]  I got a pirate pizza.
[4255.74s -> 4262.99s]  Just give me that one.
[4262.99s -> 4264.61s]  Let me make it. I'll do it.
[4264.61s -> 4272.61s]  Get out of the way.
[4272.61s -> 4273.41s]  How do I buy a pizza?
[4273.41s -> 4274.59s]  I want to buy one.
[4274.59s -> 4287.45s]  Oh, here we go. Seven bucks.
[4287.45s -> 4290.25s]  Didn't I sit here a few years ago and buy like 100 of these?
[4290.49s -> 4309.16s]  Is it done?
[4309.16s -> 4323.31s]  I just dumped that on myself.
[4323.31s -> 4327.28s]  Eat an entire pizza.
[4327.28s -> 4328.12s]  Ooh, tuna.
[4328.12s -> 4329.48s]  Ooh, tuna sandwich.
[4329.48s -> 4330.64s]  That sounds great.
[4330.64s -> 4332.84s]  Oh, man, that sounds amazing right now.
[4338.03s -> 4338.83s]  All right. Let's see.
[4338.83s -> 4342.91s]  I want a tuna sandwich.
[4342.91s -> 4345.86s]  And I want relish on it.
[4345.86s -> 4361.05s]  I want going to cook these like little plastic thing.
[4362.74s -> 4366.70s]  Look at that milk.
[4366.70s -> 4370.81s]  Oh, there it is.
[4370.81s -> 4377.31s]  I'm very satisfied.
[4377.31s -> 4381.46s]  Lemonista 450.
[4387.90s -> 4389.06s]  That sounds great.
[4389.06s -> 4401.98s]  Fresh squeezed lemonade.
[4401.98s -> 4407.05s]  That might be one of the best drinks.
[4407.05s -> 4410.13s]  Like when I think of a treat beverage, I think of fresh squeezed lemonade.
[4410.33s -> 4426.36s]  For sure. Yeah. Oh, yeah.
[4426.36s -> 4428.08s]  Now you can't play Dizzy Bird.
[4428.08s -> 4431.38s]  Yes, I can.
[4431.38s -> 4434.47s]  Yeah. Watch this. I get it.
[4434.47s -> 4437.33s]  All right. So I think that's all the mall.
[4437.33s -> 4438.57s]  Did I miss any stores?
[4438.57s -> 4439.65s]  We went to the jewelry store.
[4439.65s -> 4449.37s]  Wait, what's this? Nothing.
[4449.37s -> 4450.79s]  Spunkies.
[4450.79s -> 4452.15s]  Whoa, this.
[4452.15s -> 4456.01s]  All right. This is cool.
[4456.01s -> 4463.11s]  Spunkies.
[4463.11s -> 4470.32s]  Yep. Oh, yeah.
[4470.32s -> 4473.22s]  Hoverboards.
[4473.22s -> 4474.62s]  I have one of these.
[4474.62s -> 4477.51s]  I have two of these in real life.
[4483.92s -> 4485.48s]  Not the back.
[4485.48s -> 4488.72s]  Go to the back.
[4488.72s -> 4498.39s]  Not the back.
[4498.39s -> 4506.20s]  Light sword.
[4506.20s -> 4508.90s]  OK, you want to know what's crazy?
[4508.90s -> 4513.38s]  Think about this from here to here.
[4513.38s -> 4516.42s]  You are in a different store at Spunkies.
[4517.90s -> 4520.01s]  Do you know what I'm saying?
[4520.01s -> 4522.69s]  Like, it's crazy that it's just like, oh, yeah, come on in.
[4522.69s -> 4524.69s]  Look at all. There's like.
[4526.78s -> 4528.70s]  Oh, Luke Skywalker.
[4528.70s -> 4532.14s]  Oh, my God. Oh, look, there's a gorilla's T-shirt.
[4532.77s -> 4533.77s]  Oh, where is it?
[4533.77s -> 4537.22s]  This is a completely different store now.
[4537.22s -> 4538.66s]  This is a different store.
[4538.66s -> 4541.55s]  And I don't know if I should be in here.
[4550.50s -> 4552.38s]  Don't forget the mushroom posters.
[4552.38s -> 4556.82s]  That's right.
[4556.82s -> 4562.26s]  And there was always right here, right here, right here on a rack right here.
[4562.26s -> 4563.66s]  It would be right in front of me.
[4563.66s -> 4567.62s]  There'd be a book where a fart is coming out of some guy's ass.
[4568.50s -> 4569.70s]  It's just a little book.
[4569.70s -> 4573.18s]  And it's like, oh, there's like a smoke fart coming out of a guy's ass.
[4574.42s -> 4575.82s]  I don't even know what the product is.
[4575.82s -> 4577.02s]  I just know that it's here.
[4577.02s -> 4601.38s]  It's literally right here on capacitor, right next to the edible underwear.
[4601.38s -> 4611.04s]  Yep. And if you're wondering, this is definitely where.
[4611.69s -> 4614.93s]  Do you remember? This is like four years ago when I didn't I get in a fight
[4614.93s -> 4619.57s]  with everybody here saying that there was a product where like you put the coin in
[4619.57s -> 4621.61s]  and like the guy like shits his pants or something.
[4621.61s -> 4623.09s]  Somebody like farts.
[4623.09s -> 4624.82s]  It's like a toy.
[4624.82s -> 4626.34s]  And people were like, that's not real.
[4626.34s -> 4628.50s]  And I was like, yes, it is.
[4628.50s -> 4630.10s]  You put a coin. It's like a little bank.
[4630.10s -> 4631.54s]  You put a coin in and it's like
[4633.06s -> 4636.11s]  the guy like farts.
[4636.11s -> 4638.80s]  It's a real product.
[4638.80s -> 4641.12s]  And everybody told me, no way, dude, you're out of your mind.
[4641.12s -> 4642.20s]  And then people were like, no, it's real.
[4642.20s -> 4650.14s]  Actually, it is real.
[4650.14s -> 4653.75s]  This was such a weird store.
[4653.75s -> 4656.63s]  Yeah. And also make sure you go right here to grab.
[4657.73s -> 4662.19s]  They were always in the front of the store posters for movies
[4662.19s -> 4664.15s]  that have not been relevant in 10 years.
[4666.31s -> 4669.11s]  Well, I swear there's like an Indiana Jones two poster in here
[4671.54s -> 4679.26s]  and it's from 1990 old bands that broke up five years ago.
[4679.26s -> 4684.27s]  We're in here.
[4684.27s -> 4686.31s]  Yeah. Adam Sandler's click is in here.
[4686.31s -> 4689.01s]  Exactly. That's correct.
[4689.01s -> 4690.41s]  Hot tub time machine.
[4690.41s -> 4697.95s]  Yep. This step brothers posters in here.
[4704.34s -> 4708.63s]  What a wild store.
[4708.63s -> 4713.09s]  What a fucking crazy place that really is.
[4713.29s -> 4725.14s]  Spencer's like I can't imagine like being the person
[4725.14s -> 4727.64s]  that was responsible for like, oh, what's going to be in the store?
[4727.64s -> 4728.28s]  All right. Yeah.
[4728.28s -> 4731.00s]  Well, we're going to have Finding Nemo.
[4731.00s -> 4735.43s]  Stickers have to be over here.
[4735.43s -> 4738.83s]  And then, yeah, just fill up the back with all, you know,
[4738.99s -> 4741.60s]  the thing you put your hand on for the electricity.
[4741.60s -> 4743.56s]  But also we have to have the edible underwear,
[4744.52s -> 4746.68s]  some of the other fucking pornographic material.
[4751.40s -> 4753.72s]  Yeah, I think what's that book?
[4754.28s -> 4756.56s]  What's that book about all the sex positions?
[4756.96s -> 4759.22s]  What's it called?
[4759.22s -> 4761.63s]  Yeah, I want that over here.
[4761.63s -> 4764.63s]  Put that like 10 feet to the left of the of the silly string.
[4768.42s -> 4769.70s]  It was a wild place.
[4784.37s -> 4785.93s]  They had the boobie mugs, too.
[4785.93s -> 4800.22s]  Don't forget that. Yeah.
[4800.22s -> 4803.73s]  Yeah. What what an interesting thought.
[4803.73s -> 4806.81s]  No other store I can think of you could leave
[4807.78s -> 4810.38s]  with the funny science experiment.
[4810.38s -> 4814.35s]  Put your hand on the globe and a sex position book
[4814.55s -> 4828.83s]  in the same checkout counter.
[4828.83s -> 4832.89s]  They definitely had a thing of fake poop.
[4832.89s -> 4834.66s]  I'm sure they did.
[4834.66s -> 4847.02s]  Actually, I think I know what you mean. Yeah.
[4847.02s -> 4853.97s]  Wow. Memories.
[4853.97s -> 4854.61s]  Did I see all the mall?
[4854.61s -> 4866.20s]  Let me make sure I didn't miss anything.
[4866.20s -> 4867.48s]  How much longer are you going to be streaming for?
[4867.48s -> 4869.86s]  Um, probably not much longer.
[4869.86s -> 4872.97s]  I'm going to do Dizzy Bird and probably call it there.
[4872.97s -> 4874.95s]  Wait, I want to do this.
[4874.95s -> 4877.41s]  Oh, I need a dollar to do the thing.
[4877.41s -> 4882.81s]  I know where to get money.
[4882.81s -> 4884.47s]  No, no, no. Wrong.
[4884.47s -> 4886.35s]  I thought that was the arcade. Wrong.
[4894.14s -> 4895.82s]  How much longer do you think you're going to be alive?
[4895.82s -> 4899.81s]  I'm making it to 100.
[4899.81s -> 4900.65s]  I'm going to make it to 100.
[4900.65s -> 4901.37s]  They're going to interview me.
[4901.37s -> 4905.58s]  I'm going to have like garlic around my neck
[4905.58s -> 4909.38s]  and like vials of manuka honey that I swear by.
[4915.21s -> 4916.97s]  Where's the money thing?
[4916.97s -> 4942.93s]  Where is it?
[4942.93s -> 4945.30s]  100. No, I don't.
[4945.30s -> 4946.26s]  I don't know if I would.
[4946.26s -> 4954.06s]  I don't know if I'd want to be 100.
[4954.06s -> 4958.38s]  I think 100 is I think that's it's I don't know if I want to be honored
[4961.74s -> 4963.50s]  at 100. I'm not even sure.
[4963.50s -> 4966.91s]  I'm trying to think of how my body would be functioning at 100
[4968.03s -> 4970.11s]  because I know how it functions now, right now.
[4976.10s -> 4980.85s]  I feel like at 100, if I accidentally close my finger in a car door,
[4981.05s -> 4983.57s]  my whole body is going to explode into dust.
[4986.43s -> 4987.51s]  I just won't exist anymore.
[4987.51s -> 4991.64s]  It'll just be like, ah, just completely gone.
[4998.24s -> 5000.28s]  That's when you get I don't know when you get to be 100.
[5000.28s -> 5002.16s]  It's like that's remarkable.
[5002.16s -> 5004.12s]  That's unbelievable.
[5004.12s -> 5007.40s]  But that's when I start to see the person talking
[5008.24s -> 5013.44s]  and their teeth come out like that's what happens when you get to be 100.
[5014.13s -> 5016.26s]  I don't know if I want to do that.
[5016.26s -> 5016.86s]  I'm not sure.
[5016.86s -> 5019.58s]  I don't really want to experience that at any point.
[5020.86s -> 5023.10s]  I don't want to be mid-sentence and be like,
[5023.10s -> 5027.53s]  let me just ruin my teeth around and the teeth are just gone out.
[5028.34s -> 5030.18s]  I don't know if I don't know if I want that.
[5030.18s -> 5044.42s]  I don't know if I want to do that.
[5044.42s -> 5050.49s]  Don't buy shit teeth then.
[5050.49s -> 5057.52s]  That sounds like something you would actually love doing.
[5057.52s -> 5058.88s]  Actually, like, like, I don't know.
[5058.88s -> 5062.19s]  I think that is actually kind of funny.
[5062.19s -> 5062.75s]  All right.
[5062.75s -> 5064.88s]  Now, what do you everybody stop?
[5064.88s -> 5070.57s]  The next time that I am able to present, I'm presenting something.
[5071.51s -> 5073.75s]  I'm going to have fake teeth and and I'm going to they're going to
[5073.75s -> 5082.48s]  oh, they're going to come out.
[5082.48s -> 5091.36s]  OK, isn't Dizzy Bird's here somewhere?
[5091.36s -> 5093.46s]  Isn't Dizzy Bird here?
[5093.46s -> 5096.80s]  Dizzy Bird's in a few places.
[5096.80s -> 5113.11s]  Wait, I want to play this guy.
[5113.11s -> 5118.48s]  This guy's shit faced.
[5118.48s -> 5127.09s]  That's like a crayon.
[5127.09s -> 5128.65s]  We've done this before a few times.
[5128.65s -> 5131.29s]  Oh, it's in the regular arcade.
[5131.45s -> 5145.15s]  Just Larry's, right?
[5145.15s -> 5147.22s]  It's some carnival food.
[5147.22s -> 5152.38s]  Carnival food is so great.
[5152.38s -> 5157.45s]  What is the best food at a carnival?
[5157.45s -> 5160.34s]  Fried dough. That's easy.
[5160.34s -> 5161.82s]  Wait, that's not true.
[5161.82s -> 5164.36s]  No, that's not true.
[5165.96s -> 5167.64s]  Oh, I'm really late to this.
[5167.64s -> 5168.28s]  Sorry, everybody.
[5168.28s -> 5172.40s]  It's nine o'clock at night.
[5172.40s -> 5176.53s]  Oh, it's the it's the hot Italian sausages.
[5178.69s -> 5181.01s]  You know, the one, you know, you know, the kiosk.
[5181.82s -> 5185.44s]  It's that one.
[5185.44s -> 5186.88s]  I remember when I was.
[5186.88s -> 5189.04s]  Oh, man, this is such a long time ago.
[5191.14s -> 5192.10s]  I'm not making it up.
[5192.10s -> 5194.42s]  I ate I think I ate four of those in a row.
[5194.62s -> 5198.82s]  I had to have been like under.
[5198.82s -> 5202.48s]  I was probably like twenty nineteen maybe.
[5203.17s -> 5207.05s]  I ate four of those hot Italian sausages and it was such a bad.
[5207.13s -> 5207.73s]  It was awful.
[5207.73s -> 5208.41s]  And I knew it was.
[5208.41s -> 5209.21s]  But I was like, I have to.
[5209.21s -> 5211.81s]  This is only how many times do you come to like the carnival?
[5220.61s -> 5221.25s]  Not at once.
[5221.25s -> 5226.42s]  It was in a it was it was over the course of it was probably
[5226.42s -> 5228.38s]  over the course of a couple of hours, actually.
[5228.38s -> 5231.90s]  But it was in a row.
[5231.90s -> 5235.06s]  Guys, I'm also that person that makes sure there is a dole
[5235.06s -> 5240.00s]  whip in my hand for at least two thirds of the time I'm walking around Disneyland.
[5241.22s -> 5244.86s]  So I love my carnival food.
[5244.86s -> 5259.62s]  I love my theme park food.
[5259.62s -> 5261.50s]  Cotton candy is all right.
[5261.50s -> 5265.74s]  I think cotton candy.
[5265.74s -> 5270.42s]  I'm I kind of like taking a piece of somebody else's cotton candy, but a whole one.
[5273.44s -> 5275.40s]  I feel the same way about movie popcorn.
[5275.40s -> 5278.62s]  The way I do about cotton candy.
[5278.62s -> 5281.26s]  I'll take a handful from somebody else's popcorn,
[5281.75s -> 5283.11s]  but I don't want to buy a popcorn.
[5283.11s -> 5285.07s]  I don't want to buy my own cotton candy.
[5285.07s -> 5287.27s]  I'll have a piece of yours if you'll give it to me.
[5293.17s -> 5294.57s]  What about funnel cake?
[5294.57s -> 5296.65s]  Fried dough is funnel cake, right?
[5296.65s -> 5298.86s]  Or no, it's a wait. It's different.
[5298.86s -> 5301.44s]  Funnel cake is the one that it's kind of stringy.
[5301.80s -> 5303.86s]  Fried dough is in one piece.
[5305.61s -> 5308.49s]  That's right.
[5308.49s -> 5310.49s]  I think funnel cake is better than fried dough,
[5314.63s -> 5317.03s]  with one very, very important exception.
[5318.85s -> 5319.97s]  One piece.
[5319.97s -> 5323.51s]  What do you mean? It's in one.
[5323.51s -> 5325.73s]  Yeah. All right.
[5325.73s -> 5328.61s]  OK, fried dough is funnel cake, but it's one big.
[5329.09s -> 5330.29s]  It's like a big piece of bread.
[5330.29s -> 5335.41s]  It's like a giant loaf of bread.
[5335.41s -> 5338.37s]  Funnel cake is sort of stringy and swirly, right?
[5344.38s -> 5346.74s]  There's one part of a piece of fried dough,
[5347.20s -> 5352.38s]  the very middle that has the pool of cinnamon and oil.
[5353.71s -> 5354.83s]  You get it. It's right to the middle.
[5354.83s -> 5357.11s]  It is soaked up cinnamon, sugar and oil in the middle.
[5357.84s -> 5359.32s]  And it's it's heaven.
[5359.32s -> 5369.92s]  It's heavenly.
[5369.92s -> 5371.48s]  And you fill it with sugar.
[5371.48s -> 5374.56s]  That see that chat member knows exactly what's going on.
[5376.58s -> 5381.46s]  Yes. You make a little a little island in the middle
[5381.46s -> 5385.06s]  with cinnamon and sugar.
[5385.06s -> 5394.23s]  I can't even see it. Where is it?
[5394.23s -> 5396.75s]  Chat member, aka loser.
[5397.91s -> 5400.74s]  All right. Actually, time that person out.
[5400.74s -> 5401.70s]  All right. Time that person out.
[5401.70s -> 5409.85s]  Actually, that person should get a time out.
[5417.73s -> 5419.68s]  Wait, hold on.
[5419.68s -> 5423.65s]  Aren't you here, too?
[5423.65s -> 5427.29s]  You can't say chat member, aka fucking loser.
[5427.49s -> 5430.78s]  But you're in the chat.
[5430.78s -> 5432.55s]  Come on, man.
[5432.55s -> 5434.43s]  We're just hanging out here together.
[5434.79s -> 5445.26s]  We're just chilling.
[5445.26s -> 5446.78s]  It was in quotes, too.
[5446.78s -> 5448.14s]  That's what that was.
[5448.14s -> 5450.74s]  Fucking so funny.
[5450.74s -> 5467.57s]  Chat member was in quotes.
[5467.57s -> 5469.25s]  Hey, is this Baldur's Gate waiting room?
[5469.25s -> 5472.24s]  I don't know. You're going to play it.
[5472.24s -> 5473.80s]  What if you want to play?
[5473.80s -> 5490.14s]  Go for it.
[5490.14s -> 5491.94s]  Have you seen one piece on Netflix?
[5491.94s -> 5495.18s]  No, I have not.
[5495.18s -> 5498.35s]  And I'm sorry, guys.
[5498.35s -> 5503.78s]  I I don't have it in me to watch a thousand episodes of television.
[5504.72s -> 5506.45s]  I don't have it in me.
[5506.45s -> 5517.72s]  I just don't have it in me.
[5517.72s -> 5520.72s]  Can you imagine if the live action version was going to have the same
[5520.72s -> 5524.20s]  amount of episodes as the anime?
[5524.20s -> 5527.86s]  I hope those actors are ready to sign on for the next 30 years.
[5528.95s -> 5531.84s]  So it's going to take 30 seasons in a row.
[5540.28s -> 5542.34s]  It'll take so long.
[5542.34s -> 5544.42s]  It'll take like 70 years to get there.
[5545.08s -> 5549.52s]  They'll have to recast the actors five or six different times.
[5553.54s -> 5558.12s]  Soap opera one piece.
[5558.12s -> 5565.77s]  Yeah, that's it right there. I got it.
[5565.77s -> 5567.89s]  I have heard that the Netflix show is good, though.
[5568.41s -> 5570.37s]  I've heard, hey, actually, it's pretty good.
[5579.61s -> 5581.88s]  Who said that?
[5581.88s -> 5583.84s]  Oh, boy. What did I do?
[5584.12s -> 5589.66s]  Oh, boy. Oh, I shouldn't have said anything.
[5590.45s -> 5601.72s]  Oh, boy. That's it.
[5604.98s -> 5612.66s]  If you're a fan, it's OK.
[5612.66s -> 5615.30s]  I just don't know.
[5615.30s -> 5618.19s]  I don't I don't know if I'll watch it.
[5618.19s -> 5623.00s]  Not because I don't care about one piece, but I don't know.
[5623.00s -> 5625.82s]  I just what's a TV show that I really want to watch?
[5626.10s -> 5639.82s]  It's not one piece.
[5639.82s -> 5642.94s]  Bro, it's good. It's good.
[5642.94s -> 5645.50s]  People are saying Mob Psycho.
[5645.50s -> 5650.46s]  You know what?
[5650.46s -> 5653.81s]  I will watch Mob Psycho before I'm 40.
[5656.16s -> 5657.48s]  OK, I will watch Mob Psycho
[5657.48s -> 5661.59s]  and the Smurfs movie at the same time on different monitors.
[5676.74s -> 5678.22s]  Please watch. Oh, that's right.
[5678.22s -> 5679.96s]  I do have to watch.
[5679.96s -> 5681.04s]  I got a few movies to watch.
[5681.04s -> 5685.29s]  What's the best mini food like mini pizza, mini bagels?
[5687.26s -> 5697.14s]  That's mini food.
[5697.14s -> 5703.75s]  Um, do donut holes count?
[5708.02s -> 5716.33s]  That could be it.
[5716.33s -> 5719.31s]  Those are probably up there.
[5719.31s -> 5723.51s]  Powder donut donut holes or glazed donut donut holes.
[5729.55s -> 5730.47s]  Barry's a very good show.
[5730.47s -> 5733.67s]  I've seen the first season of Barry.
[5733.67s -> 5735.79s]  I just didn't ever turn it back on.
[5735.79s -> 5739.51s]  Kind of like what I did with Critical Soul, which I don't know why.
[5740.11s -> 5751.59s]  I really liked it.
[5751.59s -> 5752.67s]  All right. How many is this?
[5752.67s -> 5753.87s]  Did I do it 40 times?
[5753.87s -> 5761.26s]  Because it's time to go.
[5761.26s -> 5763.49s]  Oh, man.
[5763.49s -> 5769.11s]  I said 40, right?
[5769.11s -> 5771.39s]  This one, this is the easiest one to get.
[5771.39s -> 5775.55s]  It's like right here.
[5775.55s -> 5787.39s]  Oh, so close.
[5787.39s -> 5791.41s]  That's not going to make it.
[5791.41s -> 5795.63s]  Play till you win.
[5795.63s -> 5796.35s]  Ah, all right.
[5796.35s -> 5797.59s]  This is the one right now.
[5797.59s -> 5803.46s]  Here we go. Got it.
[5803.46s -> 5804.46s]  I mean, I got it. I got it.
[5804.46s -> 5806.14s]  I'm good. I beat it.
[5806.14s -> 5810.91s]  I beat it. All right.
[5810.91s -> 5812.03s]  Now, holy shit.
[5812.03s -> 5817.10s]  There's a lot of tickets here.
[5817.10s -> 5821.08s]  Go two in a row.
[5821.08s -> 5822.80s]  Oh, almost two in a row.
[5822.80s -> 5837.74s]  That was pretty good.
[5837.74s -> 5838.66s]  This is a cozy game.
[5838.66s -> 5841.86s]  I love this game.
[5841.90s -> 5871.86s]  Is there anything else I want to play last second before I'm done?
[5871.86s -> 5879.38s]  Damn, this one's a scam.
[5879.38s -> 5880.50s]  Yeah. What do they say?
[5880.50s -> 5883.68s]  If any of these have like Nintendo switches in them,
[5885.21s -> 5889.65s]  it's like your odds of winning are like incredibly horrible, right?
[5891.36s -> 5894.12s]  You're looking for the ones that have like the five dollar gift cards in them
[5894.62s -> 5897.22s]  because those ones typically are much easier to hit.
[5906.96s -> 5912.34s]  They are impossible.
[5912.34s -> 5914.54s]  Just buy a Nintendo switch at GameStop.
[5919.18s -> 5921.34s]  I've met people that have won these.
[5921.34s -> 5922.98s]  They're definitely possible.
[5922.98s -> 5926.09s]  Otherwise, nobody would play them.
[5926.09s -> 5928.73s]  But it's got to get really lucky that you get in there
[5928.73s -> 5932.49s]  when the machine is like, yep, it's time for you to for someone to win.
[5935.38s -> 5938.83s]  Although this one might be only skilled.
[5939.15s -> 5949.06s]  I don't know. I'm not sure how this one works.
[5949.06s -> 5951.62s]  I got stuck in one of these once.
[5951.62s -> 5957.91s]  What? I read that really like that was a very normal occurrence.
[5959.46s -> 5960.74s]  Apparently you got stuck.
[5960.74s -> 5962.30s]  All right. Well, I hope you're right.
[5962.30s -> 5966.89s]  I want to ask how, but I kind of don't.
[5967.46s -> 5974.03s]  I don't think I even need we don't even need the story.
[5974.03s -> 5979.75s]  Yeah, we don't need the story.
[5979.79s -> 6001.80s]  Oh, a glow stick.
[6001.80s -> 6017.38s]  I give my shit.
[6017.38s -> 6018.54s]  Yeah, I read it and weep.
[6018.54s -> 6021.42s]  Look at that. I got the ticket.
[6033.53s -> 6040.16s]  And I get a slingshot.
[6040.16s -> 6041.56s]  All right. Last game is it?
[6041.56s -> 6042.76s]  And then I'm going to call the stream.
[6042.76s -> 6045.08s]  I'm going to make sure I get another major prize. Let's go.
[6049.72s -> 6050.76s]  Thanks for watching, everybody.
[6050.76s -> 6057.08s]  This has been Sunday.
[6057.08s -> 6062.00s]  Hope you're having a good weekend.
[6062.00s -> 6067.15s]  I got a dragon armor correspond.
[6067.15s -> 6069.22s]  This is also fun.
[6069.22s -> 6071.30s]  I don't know what my plan is next week.
[6071.80s -> 6072.76s]  I would just keep an eye on the sauce.
[6072.76s -> 6075.56s]  Probably another later in the week stream.
[6076.31s -> 6078.31s]  I might I probably will do two streams at the end of the week.
[6084.06s -> 6092.19s]  We might double it up.
[6092.19s -> 6096.89s]  Maybe play Armored Core on one of those and go from there.
[6104.04s -> 6119.38s]  All right. I got to focus.
[6119.38s -> 6131.06s]  Go for it.
[6131.06s -> 6143.58s]  Yeah, I don't have enough coins.
[6154.60s -> 6155.60s]  Can I sell anything?
[6155.60s -> 6157.20s]  Can I see anybody?
[6157.20s -> 6159.60s]  Anyone want to buy a pair of headphones?
[6175.76s -> 6177.96s]  I'm never going to that piece of shit ever again.
[6179.10s -> 6180.98s]  All that place does is take your fucking money.
[6180.98s -> 6182.22s]  The slots don't even pay out.
[6182.22s -> 6183.38s]  Don't even go in there.
[6183.38s -> 6197.19s]  It's not even worth it.
[6197.19s -> 6199.05s]  I'll see you guys later.
[6199.05s -> 6199.65s]  Thanks for watching.
[6199.65s -> 6203.06s]  See you guys next week.
[6203.06s -> 6205.80s]  Probably like Saturday, Saturday, Sunday.
[6207.02s -> 6209.12s]  I'm liking the weekend stuff.
[6209.16s -> 6216.65s]  Weekend streams, I weekends are pretty open and it's nice, too.
[6216.65s -> 6219.50s]  It's nice to kind of wind down on the weekend and just play and hang out.
[6220.06s -> 6226.21s]  I like it a lot.
[6226.21s -> 6229.85s]  Expect more like Saturday, Sunday, sometimes Saturday, Sunday, both.
[6230.29s -> 6232.73s]  Sometimes maybe just one.
[6232.73s -> 6235.33s]  But I'm imagining next weekend I'll probably want to play
[6237.51s -> 6240.57s]  pretty a little bit further into Armored Core six than I already did.
[6241.51s -> 6242.71s]  That just scared the fuck out of me.
[6242.71s -> 6243.59s]  What just happened?
[6243.59s -> 6249.15s]  Oh, right.
[6249.15s -> 6249.79s]  Hope you had a good time.
[6249.79s -> 6251.05s]  I had a good time.
[6251.05s -> 6255.49s]  I'm glad that I got through the water filter release partially.
[6259.57s -> 6260.25s]  Take care of yourselves.
[6260.25s -> 6261.58s]  Have a good rest of your weekend.
[6261.58s -> 6264.58s]  I know it's pretty much over, but see you next week.
[6264.58s -> 6266.62s]  Probably Saturday or Sunday or maybe both.
[6266.98s -> 6273.87s]  I would say at least Saturday.
[6273.87s -> 6277.23s]  Take care of yourselves and call your mother.
[6279.89s -> 6282.58s]  What about Darken Darker?
[6282.58s -> 6285.58s]  I'm going to do some serious looking into Darken Darker
[6285.78s -> 6288.02s]  because I keep getting the urge to play it.
[6288.78s -> 6295.07s]  I just want to play it.
[6295.07s -> 6296.67s]  Yeah, you keep the sus pretty vague.
[6296.67s -> 6304.18s]  Just say this coming weekend.
[6304.18s -> 6305.58s]  I also want to play browser games.
[6305.58s -> 6306.14s]  I just want to do.
[6306.14s -> 6307.98s]  Yeah, we'll do two streams this coming weekend.
[6307.98s -> 6309.80s]  That makes sense to me.
[6309.80s -> 6310.84s]  At the very least, we'll do it.
[6310.84s -> 6312.84s]  We'll just put the sus for Saturday.
[6316.05s -> 6317.92s]  Maybe. Hmm.
[6317.92s -> 6322.51s]  Just say at the end of the week, pick one.
[6322.51s -> 6326.35s]  I want to make sure I'm not thinking, overthinking this.
[6327.53s -> 6329.09s]  They might have something going on on Saturday.
[6329.09s -> 6336.82s]  But let's see.
[6336.82s -> 6348.10s]  What did I just click on?
[6348.10s -> 6352.11s]  Yeah, definitely at the end of the week, though.
[6352.11s -> 6357.62s]  See you guys later. See you soon.
[6357.62s -> 6360.50s]  Actually working on a lot of really, really fun stuff for Offbrand.
[6361.53s -> 6367.02s]  I'm imagining that very soon here, be able to kind of maybe share
[6367.02s -> 6373.35s]  some of that stuff, because I've been kind of supplementally involved
[6373.35s -> 6378.38s]  in a lot of Offbrand's stuff that you've seen, but not really like in it,
[6378.38s -> 6382.05s]  in it like I'm going, I'm going for it.
[6382.05s -> 6384.39s]  Because when I joined the company,
[6384.39s -> 6388.53s]  you know, obviously there was stuff that there was going on
[6388.53s -> 6392.30s]  that I wasn't really on yet.
[6392.30s -> 6394.42s]  But supplementally, you've seen a couple of shows
[6395.44s -> 6398.14s]  that I had some stuff to do with, but not really.
[6399.23s -> 6403.66s]  The stuff I'm working on now, that is I'm very, very involved in.
[6403.70s -> 6404.98s]  So I'm looking forward to it.
[6404.98s -> 6417.47s]  Let's see how it plays out.
[6417.47s -> 6419.11s]  What's my game of the year for 2023?
[6419.11s -> 6423.20s]  Well, 2023 isn't over.
[6423.20s -> 6426.10s]  Pizza Tower, Resident Evil 4 Remake.
[6429.58s -> 6431.22s]  I've been I've been writing them down.
[6431.22s -> 6433.38s]  My throat is so weird lately.
[6433.38s -> 6445.22s]  I have been writing them down.
[6445.22s -> 6450.94s]  I wrote Dark and Darker on here.
[6450.94s -> 6456.46s]  I think right now it's probably a Resident Evil 4 Remake or Pizza Tower.
[6458.21s -> 6460.13s]  Although I haven't played Baldur's Gate 3.
[6465.23s -> 6472.07s]  I know that's probably going to change my mind.
[6472.07s -> 6473.71s]  Although we'll see.
[6473.71s -> 6477.55s]  I'm not a huge fan of top down,
[6477.97s -> 6482.54s]  more kind of turn based action adventure type games.
[6483.71s -> 6487.58s]  But just what I've heard and seen or what you can do in Baldur's Gate 3
[6487.58s -> 6490.02s]  and how stuff happens in Baldur's Gate 3.
[6491.51s -> 6492.19s]  What about Sorcery?
[6492.19s -> 6494.35s]  Sorcery was more of a book to me than a game.
[6496.70s -> 6497.70s]  I read Sorcery.
[6497.70s -> 6503.10s]  I don't really play Sorcery.
[6503.10s -> 6507.53s]  I probably will like it.
[6507.53s -> 6514.44s]  It's a lot like Sorcery.
[6514.44s -> 6516.24s]  Baldur's Gate 3 has actual porn in it.
[6519.38s -> 6521.69s]  OK, whatever.
[6521.69s -> 6526.65s]  How about Starfield?
[6526.65s -> 6529.71s]  Starfield is on Game Pass right now.
[6529.71s -> 6532.82s]  And I have to I've got to tell you the truth, because all I can be.
[6532.82s -> 6535.42s]  I want to be truthful.
[6535.42s -> 6537.70s]  I opened up Starfield on Game Pass.
[6538.97s -> 6542.45s]  I fell asleep within, I want to say, an hour.
[6545.87s -> 6550.90s]  Now, that does not necessarily mean I thought that Starfield wasn't a good game.
[6550.90s -> 6552.50s]  I may have been very tired.
[6552.50s -> 6556.25s]  I was I was very sleepy.
[6556.41s -> 6564.15s]  It put him to sleep.
[6564.15s -> 6566.94s]  It wasn't a bad experience.
[6566.94s -> 6567.26s]  All right.
[6567.26s -> 6573.03s]  I got to the point when, OK, you you get off the ship,
[6575.76s -> 6579.12s]  you touch that thing and I don't want to spoil anything.
[6579.12s -> 6586.22s]  But like you get off the ship, the guy says,
[6586.97s -> 6589.21s]  Oh, hey, you must be new here.
[6589.21s -> 6592.37s]  Hey, you can sell items over there on the right at that kiosk.
[6592.74s -> 6595.02s]  Welcome to the city.
[6598.42s -> 6599.78s]  That's the first 10 minutes, dude.
[6599.78s -> 6603.75s]  That's New Atlantis. Yeah.
[6603.75s -> 6605.39s]  And then I don't OK.
[6605.39s -> 6606.54s]  Listen to me.
[6606.54s -> 6612.58s]  I like accidentally attacked somebody and I had to I had to redo a whole save file
[6612.82s -> 6614.94s]  because I accidentally hit somebody in the face with something.
[6615.81s -> 6618.21s]  And then the whole city starts fucking attacking me.
[6622.46s -> 6625.96s]  And even after dying, they still come after you.
[6627.18s -> 6629.79s]  And I remember Holly was sitting right next to me on the couch.
[6629.79s -> 6634.18s]  I'm like, what do I do if I like attack somebody in a city
[6634.70s -> 6636.30s]  and the whole city is attacking me now?
[6636.30s -> 6638.22s]  And when I die, they all still attack me.
[6639.83s -> 6648.26s]  What do I do?
[6648.26s -> 6654.78s]  You have to save scum.
[6654.78s -> 6656.10s]  Oh, no, the actions of my own cons.
[6656.10s -> 6660.26s]  Put away your weapon and let the cops take you.
[6667.43s -> 6669.51s]  Maybe you should think harder about your violence.
[6670.94s -> 6673.50s]  You can leave the city for 24 hours to calm most people down,
[6673.50s -> 6686.58s]  but you'll still have a bounty.
[6686.58s -> 6689.90s]  I feel like streaming Starfield would be really fun,
[6690.26s -> 6692.62s]  but unbearable for everybody.
[6694.54s -> 6695.98s]  I just won't ever get anything done.
[6695.98s -> 6701.34s]  I'll just be throwing rocks at people and get arrested and stuff in the game.
[6701.34s -> 6708.20s]  And I'll just never get anything done.
[6708.20s -> 6710.80s]  People would be so pissed at the way that I would play that game.
[6712.62s -> 6720.31s]  I'm also, by the way, I'll tell you, just walking around in Bethesda games
[6720.87s -> 6727.06s]  and just picking up all the cups and newspapers and paperclips on every table.
[6727.34s -> 6729.46s]  I'm sick of doing that.
[6729.46s -> 6738.07s]  I don't I don't want to do that anymore.
[6738.07s -> 6742.02s]  And then you can't you can't move.
[6742.02s -> 6745.02s]  And I know it's like, don't then don't do it. Impossible.
[6746.63s -> 6748.79s]  When there's so many things highlighted in the room,
[6748.99s -> 6756.66s]  I'm going to pick up some of them in Skyrim and Oblivion.
[6757.06s -> 6759.22s]  Dude, I would just walk into the weapons merchant place
[6759.66s -> 6761.74s]  and just take every single thing from the counter
[6761.74s -> 6763.46s]  and just never come back to that town ever again.
[6763.46s -> 6776.54s]  I can't play these games.
[6776.54s -> 6782.78s]  Hoarder. It's the same thing in Baldur's Gate three.
[6782.78s -> 6787.44s]  Oh, no, you're too evil to play them.
[6788.07s -> 6792.07s]  Now, I play the game as a good character.
[6792.07s -> 6797.03s]  Anytime you guys see me play games like RPGs, I try to make good decisions,
[6797.81s -> 6805.01s]  but I do bad things like I will just throw the rock at the fucking wall.
[6805.01s -> 6807.63s]  I will just punch the guy in the face.
[6808.38s -> 6811.84s]  But I'm going to divert the laser from hitting Earth.
[6812.20s -> 6818.06s]  Do you know I'm saying I will go in the back and take every single item
[6818.06s -> 6820.46s]  from the armor merchant,
[6820.46s -> 6823.70s]  and then I'm going to go help the old lady walk across the street outside.
[6826.46s -> 6828.90s]  What is that chaotic good?
[6828.90s -> 6838.36s]  I don't know. Is it that's chaotic neutral?
[6842.77s -> 6843.57s]  I don't know.
[6843.57s -> 6848.72s]  Ball of yarn with a knife.
[6848.72s -> 6850.90s]  Oh, the Joker. That's right.
[6850.90s -> 6854.74s]  It's called balancing karma.
[6854.74s -> 6860.40s]  I usually do the good storyline, but in the good storyline,
[6862.82s -> 6866.17s]  I don't roundhouse kick somebody in the head at some point.
[6872.45s -> 6877.18s]  Chaotic. Good. That's chaotic.
[6877.18s -> 6885.07s]  Neutral. Dear God, dot, dot, dot.
[6890.03s -> 6891.19s]  Sometimes you just got to do it.
[6891.19s -> 6892.83s]  Sometimes you just have to roundhouse kick somebody.
[6892.83s -> 6897.97s]  Yeah. Chaotic. Stupid.
[6897.97s -> 6900.05s]  Please play Breath of the Wild again.
[6900.05s -> 6903.92s]  All right. OK, OK, OK.
[6905.32s -> 6907.88s]  Oh, here's what's going to happen.
[6909.11s -> 6910.87s]  You you guys have to be good, though.
[6910.87s -> 6913.15s]  You have to be good on.
[6913.15s -> 6919.15s]  You have to be good because I haven't played Breath of the Wild months.
[6919.71s -> 6921.79s]  So I it's I'm going to be like the control.
[6921.83s -> 6923.95s]  Oh, yeah, I can't believe you have to press X to jump.
[6923.95s -> 6925.47s]  But I have to press Y to jump.
[6925.47s -> 6926.83s]  This game's stupid.
[6926.83s -> 6928.79s]  Just just bear with my bullshit for a little bit.
[6929.78s -> 6932.34s]  Just just be like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know it's stupid.
[6932.34s -> 6933.54s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's fine.
[6933.54s -> 6941.76s]  Just play it and I'll play it this weekend.
[6941.76s -> 6945.48s]  What do you want to play?
[6945.48s -> 6946.92s]  I want to finish it.
[6946.92s -> 6950.94s]  I can't just not that I this one guardian left and Ganon.
[6950.94s -> 6951.70s]  That's it.
[6951.70s -> 6955.29s]  I'm almost at the end of the game.
[6955.29s -> 6956.57s]  I have to beat Breath of the Wild.
[6956.57s -> 6957.77s]  I have to at least complete that game.
[6957.77s -> 6959.81s]  I can't just let it sit there at two thirds completion.
[6960.22s -> 6961.38s]  There's no I can't do that.
[6961.38s -> 6976.32s]  Not going to happen.
[6976.32s -> 6977.32s]  Final Fantasy 16.
[6977.32s -> 6983.68s]  I actually played Final Fantasy 16 yesterday, so I have played it.
[6984.58s -> 6986.77s]  I really do like it.
[6986.77s -> 6990.45s]  I have a feeling, depending on how I feel about that game
[6992.29s -> 6998.29s]  in a few months, if I actually get to the end, that could be up there pretty high.
[7002.02s -> 7011.44s]  I might just turn that on, too, and just stream it.
[7011.44s -> 7012.98s]  All right. So here's the deal.
[7012.98s -> 7015.90s]  We're going to play Breath of the Wild, Armored Core six,
[7017.14s -> 7026.68s]  and maybe a little bit of I'm not going to play Final Fantasy 16 this weekend.
[7030.86s -> 7033.38s]  I want like an open your mouth and just sit there game.
[7034.05s -> 7038.12s]  You know, I mean, Armored Core six is intense.
[7038.56s -> 7040.78s]  Breath of the Wild is intense.
[7040.78s -> 7043.58s]  I want to I want just to open my mouth, just mouth open,
[7044.06s -> 7047.81s]  just eyes completely glazed over, just punch out.
[7048.13s -> 7051.91s]  Maybe that's not a bad idea.
[7051.91s -> 7054.07s]  Hey, that's a good idea. Yeah. All right.
[7054.07s -> 7055.70s]  All right. That's the plan.
[7055.70s -> 7057.70s]  The plan for this weekend is we're going to do Breath of the Wild
[7058.02s -> 7064.51s]  super punch out, not getting hit once.
[7064.51s -> 7068.49s]  Well, not getting downed once.
[7068.49s -> 7070.30s]  And then maybe some Armored Core.
[7070.30s -> 7077.98s]  I think that's a good plan this coming weekend.
[7077.98s -> 7084.30s]  And also, I'm going to try to beat Breath of the Wild this weekend.
[7085.55s -> 7090.34s]  So wherever we are in the game, I'm going to try to finish it up.
[7099.14s -> 7100.22s]  We will see the end.
[7100.22s -> 7108.94s]  Sure, sure, sure, surely, surely.
[7111.25s -> 7115.33s]  I'll see you guys later.
[7115.33s -> 7117.10s]  Take care of yourself. Thanks for watching.
[7117.10s -> 7120.60s]  And we'll we'll figure it out this weekend.
[7121.99s -> 7128.00s]  We'll get it all figured out this weekend.
[7128.00s -> 7130.48s]  I think that's a fairly good plan.
[7133.15s -> 7134.43s]  Good night. Goodbye.
[7134.43s -> 7140.34s]  Take care of yourselves. See you soon. Bye bye.
