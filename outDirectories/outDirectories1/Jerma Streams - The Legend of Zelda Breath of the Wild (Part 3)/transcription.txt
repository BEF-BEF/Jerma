[5.05s -> 16.95s]  I am back. Decided to take the opportunity to make another tea. Refill the beverage a little bit
[16.95s -> 29.50s]  here. And now we're going to play Breath of the Wild. It looks like the switch... I don't think
[29.50s -> 47.45s]  the switch even turned off, if I'm completely honest. Let me see here. Yeah, I don't think the
[47.45s -> 55.43s]  switch even turned off. Is this the... this is the exact screen that I was on, right? Did I just go
[55.43s -> 63.00s]  to sleep or something? I don't know. That's weird. All right, bear with me for a second because I have
[63.00s -> 79.80s]  to do some audio changes here. I have to delay my voice and the camera. Give me one second. Like this.
[80.44s -> 104.78s]  Hello, hello, hello! Okay. Okay, that should do it. Now, should I delay? I gotta delay the switch
[104.78s -> 117.14s]  audio by a little bit, right? We'll do a test. It's not working. It's not ready yet. One second,
[117.14s -> 123.74s]  hold on. I gotta refresh the camera. Gotta plug in headphones. Are you losing viewers? That's all
[123.74s -> 131.06s]  right. No, that doesn't matter. That's fine. I don't care. I mean, people want to watch Breath
[131.06s -> 134.10s]  of the Wild. They want to watch Breath of the Wild. They don't watch any fart trombone game. They
[134.10s -> 139.58s]  don't want to watch this. That's up to them. That's fine. Hey, don't worry about the view count. It's
[139.58s -> 160.95s]  all right. I don't care. Why didn't they stay? Why did they fucking stay? They should have stayed.
[161.67s -> 184.10s]  Whatever. Okay. Headphones are in. I believe I am ready to play Breath of the Wild. Change the input
[184.10s -> 195.94s]  on my screen. All right, let's go. Let's do a test here really quickly. If I go like this,
[196.34s -> 211.96s]  one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, five. We good? Seems pretty good. All right.
[211.96s -> 217.74s]  I'm going to turn this up a little for you guys because it's a little low for me.
[217.74s -> 229.93s]  How do I do that? There we go. Okay. I'm ready. So what was the last thing I did?
[233.83s -> 248.98s]  Is it too loud? Is it just right? I had a bunch of shit marked. All right, we can do this thing.
[248.98s -> 259.70s]  Audio is good. Is it fine? Okay. Oh, the face cam has to move too, yo. That's right. How's
[259.70s -> 266.86s]  this in a good spot? Turn this down. I feel like this is bright as hell. Why is this so bright?
[268.14s -> 282.33s]  Too bright. How come you look like the Hulk? It's actually kind of a compliment. All right,
[282.33s -> 290.86s]  let's go. So I wanted to kill one of the guardians, wherever that is, but maybe I'll do the Zora thing.
[290.86s -> 304.82s]  Oh, that's right. I'm never around the horse. The horse is never available.
[305.38s -> 332.84s]  Zora quest is related. Okay. So let me fast travel over here then. Look at the motorcycle.
[332.84s -> 349.16s]  There's an instant horse TP item near the second stable. Maybe one day I'll get it. Chat, shut up.
[350.20s -> 361.90s]  Wait, I... Oh, oops. Chat, shut up. Don't tell them that. Well, sorry. I got that info now,
[361.90s -> 375.66s]  don't I? This is not Shadow of Mordor, which by the way, what a great game. I was about to just
[375.66s -> 385.21s]  jump off and I thought for some reason it was going to be like... No, that's not how it works.
[388.92s -> 396.31s]  Isn't... Monolith is making a Wonder Woman game, right? I can't wait for a new Monolith game.
[397.18s -> 403.53s]  That's going to be so good. Okay. So how do I get down from here without... Oh, wait, I have
[403.53s -> 418.33s]  the glider. It's been like a week. What am I talking about? You say who cares? I mean,
[419.13s -> 425.94s]  Monolith made the two Shadow of War and Shadow of Mordor. That'll be their first game since Shadow
[425.94s -> 438.62s]  of War. All right, let's move. What do I have for weapons equipped right now? Look at all this cool
[438.62s -> 453.19s]  shit I have. I don't know when to use it. Did you like Shadow of War? I streamed Shadow of War
[454.33s -> 460.09s]  for like three or four hours. I think I streamed it one day. I honestly don't think it was more
[460.09s -> 496.28s]  than four hours. That was just odd. That was very odd. I dropped it? How do I throw this?
[500.71s -> 512.23s]  What the fuck just happened? How do I throw... I... All right, I got to get back into this.
[513.03s -> 525.59s]  It's like all the buttons are different. Yeah, that's right. The throw button. Okay.
[526.31s -> 558.74s]  All the buttons are different. Oh, my God. There's so many of them. I can't just sit on
[558.74s -> 595.83s]  these forever. I have to use these now. I use the spear. Jesus. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out.
[596.47s -> 620.81s]  All right, that's two down. You idiot. I want a bow. Do I have any arrows? How do I not have any
[620.81s -> 648.84s]  arrows? I got the frame rate. All right, that's good. Only one more. I'm good. We got it. That's
[648.84s -> 660.04s]  a good bow. Are they protecting an unlocking chest or something? I don't see anything. I saw
[660.04s -> 683.08s]  one earlier. Oh, you cannot point blank me, right? It's broken. Fuck. This shit's broken.
[683.08s -> 688.95s]  I don't want to use these weapons. I need something else. Did they drop anything else?
[696.26s -> 706.17s]  Shock arrow. Yeah, well, that's better. What the fuck is going on?
[706.17s -> 729.72s]  This happened before. I don't know what it did. What does this do? Does this respawn every enemy?
[729.72s -> 742.94s]  It respawns to every single one. I just went through all this bullshit
[743.66s -> 760.20s]  and I have to do this again. Oh, come on. All right, I'm getting the hell out of here.
[760.58s -> 763.38s]  I'm just getting out. There was a chest here, but I don't even want it anymore.
[764.02s -> 779.61s]  I don't. I don't want this. All right, we're good. There's like a warthog or something there,
[779.61s -> 793.14s]  but I don't care. Head over here. He's learning the wrong way. What do you mean?
[793.94s -> 810.47s]  I'm trying to go here. Oh, this turned out to be actually the wrong way. You're right.
[812.17s -> 822.20s]  Don't fall off and die in the waterfall, please. Is there any way to? I can get up there. It's
[822.20s -> 836.87s]  raining, but it's okay. Let me try getting up there. I think there's enough places for me to stop.
[837.43s -> 845.59s]  Yeah, I should be fine. Move this microphone a little bit closer to my mouth.
[846.23s -> 873.38s]  I think I'm all right. Impatient. You dope. Wait, the Blood Moon is sort of a memory clear
[873.38s -> 876.98s]  for the Switch. It basically resets all enemies and areas that you've affected in gameplay,
[876.98s -> 886.87s]  so the Switch doesn't have to keep storing that info in RAM. Really? That's kind of wow. Okay.
[893.66s -> 898.10s]  I can't climb this because it just rains here permanently. There's got to be a place I can get
[898.10s -> 920.02s]  up here. Even just to jump up there and then stop. I'll try it. I'll try it once. This is
[920.02s -> 930.15s]  impossible. I was going to go the other way. I was going to go around the whole thing. All right.
[930.15s -> 935.67s]  Fine. I thought I could just be a skip Andy and just jump over that and climb it and jump over.
[940.17s -> 964.02s]  Okay. You missed. No, this is plus plus. We just want regular. Okay. This one's just regular.
[973.51s -> 993.88s]  No skipping. One of those little dudes. The frog got away too. Come on. Radish. Where does
[993.88s -> 1011.18s]  this person even come from? Fuck. Okay. This is defense boost. I think I'm just going to eat this
[1011.18s -> 1020.15s]  or maybe this is just the steak. I'll be all right. Radish is a really, this is great. These are
[1020.15s -> 1028.33s]  awesome. You did a circle. I know, but I know, but I just trying to skip. I was trying to skip.
[1037.94s -> 1050.25s]  Okay. Just stay on the road. I was trying to skip. Don't eat those radishes. Don't eat them. Why not?
[1052.54s -> 1058.62s]  I'm a raw radish guy. I don't want cooked radishes. I want them raw. I want them rinsed.
[1058.62s -> 1061.90s]  Then I want to just cut the ends off and I want to put the whole, just crunch the whole thing.
[1062.62s -> 1088.02s]  Okay. Now I can skip like a moron. What's wrong with the raw radishes? Okay. A raw radish is
[1088.02s -> 1108.65s]  my favorite vegetable without a doubt. Anybody under here? No, they're good. They are. They're
[1108.65s -> 1114.68s]  amazing. You're a freak. I don't, I don't know. I think that raw radishes are the best. Call me
[1114.68s -> 1120.47s]  weirdo if you want. What about pickled radishes? Those are S tier. I think anything radishes are
[1120.47s -> 1136.79s]  S tier. A pretty bush. All right. What's in the way here? Is it going to fall? All right. So now
[1136.79s -> 1142.41s]  it's going to stay on the road. No, I don't want to watch the, I don't want to watch the hero
[1142.41s -> 1179.26s]  playthrough. We'll watch that later. What is this? What the fuck? This is boomerang. I just,
[1179.26s -> 1192.44s]  I'm standing. Get out of the water. Get out of the water, out of the water, out of the water,
[1192.44s -> 1201.62s]  out of the water, out of the water, stuff sliding down the mountain. Oh my God. What just fucking
[1201.62s -> 1219.00s]  hit me? I dropped something. What was it? I dropped a shield. I severely overestimated how
[1219.00s -> 1267.08s]  far I had to shoot that. These guys suck. All right. Hold on. I don't. Ooh, that's a good boomerang.
[1267.08s -> 1292.46s]  All right. Where's my bow? Well, I was going to say where's the ding? All right. Give me all this
[1292.46s -> 1314.44s]  shit back. All right. Do not stand in water. 24. Okay. That's actually really good. Don't throw
[1314.44s -> 1347.61s]  this. Okay. We're good. Floaty dusty thing over here. All right. Hold on. Ooh, nice. A shield. The
[1347.61s -> 1352.62s]  shield is great. This thing's got like 28 or something, right? Okay. I gotta go that way.
[1353.26s -> 1362.38s]  I'm imagining I probably have to cross the bridge, right? So no skip Andy here.
[1368.42s -> 1374.42s]  Tom Scott. This water is electrified. It will kill you if you stand within five feet of it.
[1378.68s -> 1397.67s]  Good callback from a few hours ago. All right. I'm across the bridge.
[1397.67s -> 1408.84s]  I'm physically incapable of backseating. Oh, look. Look below. Look down here.
[1410.49s -> 1421.43s]  They're everybody's favorite character. You're pretty far off. I was sure you'd be passing over
[1421.43s -> 1426.44s]  this bridge. So I've been waiting for you. You will be in Zora's domain before you know it.
[1427.00s -> 1433.91s]  In fact, I'm going to head that way to meet you there. Whoa, link. Beware warrior. A monster
[1433.91s -> 1473.75s]  approaches from behind you. Wait, would you we're doing this? Okay. Annihilated. I haven't seen a
[1473.75s -> 1494.81s]  shrine pop up. Like my favorite part of the whole game. Staying on the road. There isn't one here.
[1494.81s -> 1508.55s]  Oh, that's all right. I have to cook some food. All I have is food that doesn't heal me. It just
[1508.55s -> 1593.77s]  gives me 10 minutes of buzzing around. Oh, nice. This is a deer. I mean, I got Hyrule herb. This
[1593.77s -> 1604.14s]  healthy herb grows abundantly in the plains of Hyrule. Cook it. So where's the first guardian?
[1604.14s -> 1637.54s]  First guardian was up here, right? This kind of general area. I'll do that after. Do I have a
[1637.54s -> 1649.16s]  health potion or something? Drink the milk. Eat the raw meat. I think I was to eat one of these.
[1649.16s -> 1656.10s]  I mean, I cooked them for this very purpose. Mid-level resistance to electricity. All right,
[1656.10s -> 1664.92s]  I'm going to drink that and then I'm going to eat something that has. I mean, I cooked it for a
[1664.92s -> 1686.87s]  reason. I'm going to eat it. I cooked it for a reason. Oh, I'll take the lightning rod. That
[1686.87s -> 1710.74s]  sounds fucking awesome. Oh, all right. This is fun. Cool. I want to use. I got to keep going.
[1710.74s -> 1736.65s]  I got to utilize this. I got to take the look at this fucking road. You just use the direct path.
[1736.65s -> 1752.68s]  I don't like direct paths. I want to be able to climb a wall and jump over. I like to climb over
[1752.68s -> 1761.88s]  a wall, jump and fall and take 80% of my HP and skip five minutes of walking. I've been. I'm like
[1761.88s -> 1789.00s]  that in every game. You miss something? What did I miss? I don't see anything. Big shiny wall.
[1790.26s -> 1793.62s]  I looked at that the first one. I didn't think anything was significant with it.
[1793.62s -> 1805.53s]  I thought I could climb it. Did I look at it? Didn't I look at the other one?
[1813.88s -> 1821.03s]  Okay, I didn't want to click it again. I just whatever. All right. So a hundred years ago,
[1821.03s -> 1826.23s]  King Dorofan ascended to the throne. A stray guardian crossed Upland Zorana into our domain.
[1826.23s -> 1831.77s]  The guardian seemed unstoppable. It was then that our King Dorofan, without a thought for his own
[1831.77s -> 1836.60s]  safety, came out to face the guardian himself. With supernatural strength, he lifted the guardian
[1836.60s -> 1842.04s]  and hurled it into a ravine. The impact of the fall left the guardian pieces and was never to
[1842.04s -> 1846.44s]  trouble another Zora ever again. Citizens celebrated the king's valor from then on. Their trust and
[1846.44s -> 1851.72s]  respect for him grew beyond compare. You can still see the scar he earned that day in his forehead.
[1851.72s -> 1862.94s]  A token of his triumph. What are you reading? There's a lot of people here, right? There's a
[1862.94s -> 1870.95s]  lot of people here. I'll read the lore for the people that are here. Harry Potter? No.
[1879.86s -> 1889.74s]  You skipped all that boring shit. I'm gonna just tell you right now. Um, you be careful
[1890.46s -> 1902.95s]  saying boring and Zelda in the same sentence. I don't, I don't think I would do that. Headshot.
[1903.59s -> 1925.54s]  Headshot. Well, I mean, it's just not true. Okay. Cricket. I don't play Zelda games.
[1925.54s -> 1932.02s]  This is the first Zelda game I played in a two, almost two decades. I think this is really fun.
[1932.02s -> 1940.60s]  All right. What do I have for weapons? What do I need? Okay. I've got, what's this crap?
[1940.60s -> 1967.80s]  Yeah, drop this. There we go. That's better. All right. Can I do this? Yeah, I can. Shrine?
[1967.80s -> 1978.54s]  I thought you guys said there wasn't a shrine here. To be fair, text-based lore in most games is
[1978.54s -> 1985.34s]  boring. Put it in dialogue or something. Um, text-based lore is interesting for extra,
[1986.71s -> 1991.74s]  right? It's cool to be like, oh, you know, I could read this if I wanted to. I'll read it if I feel
[1991.74s -> 2000.82s]  like it. I never, I genuinely never read, um, text-based lore. I just kind of don't. It's not
[2000.82s -> 2017.06s]  that I don't appreciate it. It's just I, my brain just wants to move. I've been waiting for you,
[2017.06s -> 2024.10s]  Link. Welcome. Behold the pride of my people, Zora's Domain. Now I shall introduce you to the king.
[2024.82s -> 2038.73s]  Hurry this way. I tried to not have the cam come on before I like the hard
[2038.73s -> 2044.74s]  blink, but I caught it because the cam is delayed by like a thousand milliseconds. So I caught it
[2044.74s -> 2059.26s]  at the wrong time. So you saw it. The shrine's right in front of me. I don't care about anything
[2059.26s -> 2084.84s]  else but this. He loves his shrines. I really do. I like the shrines because they're these complete
[2084.84s -> 2094.41s]  just total episodes of content. Just go in, do the task. It's a small area and then leave.
[2094.41s -> 2125.91s]  I like it. Interesting. Pushing power. So what's the goal? I can walk up here? Okay.
[2125.91s -> 2160.94s]  What am I trying to do? Zora's Spear. How much damage does this thing do? Oh my god. Get rid of
[2160.94s -> 2180.71s]  this. All right. Push. Push stuff. The goal is to get the balls. I don't know. I'm going to check
[2180.71s -> 2186.47s]  this place out first. There it is. Okay. So I got to get that ball into Link. You can definitely
[2186.47s -> 2266.07s]  climb that. I think there is, Link, there is no way you can't get up there. How do I turn this on?
[2266.07s -> 2270.47s]  Oh, I have to get one of these. Okay. All right. All right. I get it. For some reason,
[2270.47s -> 2352.20s]  I thought I had to get that one in there and not any of these ones. No! Give me that. Give me that.
[2352.20s -> 2373.66s]  Give me that. Give me that. Give me that. Give me that fucking thing. What the fuck are you doing?
[2373.66s -> 2405.02s]  Why does this hurt? Defense. Does this have to come to a complete stop? It has to come to a
[2405.02s -> 2412.70s]  complete stop before I don't get hurt. I mean, this is going to work. It's going to go in there
[2412.70s -> 2536.52s]  and it's going to work. I could have just done this. Why did it explode? Why did it explode?
[2536.52s -> 2551.83s]  No, no, no. I know. But hold on. No, you fucking idiot. Get out of the way. There it is.
[2562.63s -> 2568.92s]  I'm just trying to whatever this I'm doing this the wrong way. But okay. I don't care if you
[2568.92s -> 2573.88s]  backseat, but confirm. I have to get one of those balls in there to drop the other ball. Or is it
[2573.88s -> 2584.33s]  just get the ball at the top that's orange in there? The ball that at the top and orange,
[2584.33s -> 2587.61s]  the only one that's supposed to go in there. Is that correct? Or do I have to get one in there
[2587.61s -> 2631.40s]  to make the ball drop? I don't know what you're saying. Yes, too. I got it. Okay. So you have to
[2631.40s -> 2661.08s]  get this out of her. This shit is stuck in now. Do not free chat. Keep them. Keep them locked in
[2661.08s -> 2680.94s]  here. Thank you. All right. Get the fuck out of there. I definitely have to block this with ice.
[2680.94s -> 2693.88s]  That's very clear. That's blocked. How do I move that? You know, what would have been a smart idea
[2693.88s -> 2704.86s]  was to just walk up here. I didn't even check to see if I could even go up here. I should just
[2704.86s -> 2710.46s]  walked up here. I looked up and I was like, Oh, yeah, I don't know about that. That's true. Yeah.
[2710.46s -> 2718.73s]  I think I have to do what am I doing? Just go with walk up and look. Okay. How do I actually
[2718.73s -> 2771.94s]  move this though? Dude with like an arrow? Move the fucking thing. What the fuck can I move this
[2771.94s -> 2802.42s]  for? Link, stop getting glued to every object that's around you. Okay. So I thought that was
[2802.66s -> 2844.97s]  just like a nice like spa entrance. I didn't know that I could whatever. Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit.
[2844.97s -> 2921.98s]  Oh shit. I'm fine. Oh, no, no, no. This way, this way, this way. Okay. That should be fine,
[2921.98s -> 3017.80s]  right? Oh, shut up. All right. So the issue here is I did it too hard, but I'm trying to just get
[3017.80s -> 3026.26s]  it to drop here instead. I have to move it over this. Okay. That's what I'm doing. That's the
[3026.26s -> 3061.24s]  plan. I'm making it go that way. All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. If I want it to go that
[3061.24s -> 3092.54s]  way, how? I got to block this. Block this shit right now. Now it's not going to go. All right.
[3092.54s -> 3099.77s]  That's it. It's going to end up down here. But get the, get rid of this fucking thing. Get out of
[3099.77s -> 3208.25s]  here. You're going to mess up everything. Get out of here. All right. Let him out. This person's like,
[3210.01s -> 3216.90s]  that shrine took me three times as long as it should have. That was painful.
[3216.90s -> 3246.20s]  That took an ungodly amount of time. All right. What's the score IGN? You don't know what you're,
[3246.20s -> 3263.77s]  you don't know what you're talking about. All right. That was fun. You're a, you're a
[3263.77s -> 3278.63s]  Germaniac today. So this is, okay. So now we're here. So we're in the Zora domain. Very cool. Yeah.
[3278.63s -> 3283.11s]  Some puzzles are harder than others for people. Some, look, maybe I'm better at the combat stuff
[3283.11s -> 3288.20s]  than you. Maybe I'm better at some of the other puzzles than you. Maybe you're better than me at
[3288.20s -> 3306.86s]  some of the other puzzles. But you aren't though. That's you saying that. I literally did this a
[3306.86s -> 3315.29s]  week or two ago during the 14 hour stream. That's what I did at that 10 hour mark.
[3315.85s -> 3323.80s]  I did that. Remember? That's what I did. Oh, you don't have any fins. Are you Hylian?
[3324.60s -> 3337.91s]  I'm the president of Prince Sidon's fan club. My name is Tula. Do you know Prince Sidon?
[3337.91s -> 3343.85s]  Oh, I see. Ah, Prince Sidon. Just thinking of you turns me to mush. On the other hand,
[3343.85s -> 3351.14s]  if that pack of geezers shows up again, I swear. Oh, I'm sorry. Anyway, Prince Sidon is a man with
[3351.14s -> 3355.30s]  magnificent ideas. Oh, I know. Why don't you go and have a chat with Prince Sidon? Yes, do.
[3355.94s -> 3397.61s]  I just lapped you three times. Oh, stuff! Is this a pool? You're sleeping in the pool.
[3398.81s -> 3414.95s]  That's bad, isn't it? Oh wait, aren't they, they have gills. Okay, never mind. They're fish. Yeah,
[3414.95s -> 3438.17s]  I know. I just was, I don't know, I saw the Z's pretty up top singing. That first is freaking me
[3438.17s -> 3465.59s]  out. Ah, you must be the Hylian that Sidon brought here, correct? You did well to come all the way
[3465.59s -> 3473.94s]  here. I am King Dorofan, ruler of the Zora. Hmm, that object upon your waist. Is that not a Sheikah
[3473.94s -> 3482.49s]  slate? Hmm, now that I've gotten a good look at you, it's too clear who you are. You are the Hylian
[3482.49s -> 3489.75s]  champion, Link. They're not telling me you've forgotten me. The Hylian champion? You can't mean
[3489.75s -> 3495.61s]  the Link? That champion? So that's where I've heard your name before. What a fateful coincidence that
[3495.61s -> 3501.14s]  we should cross paths. I cannot believe it. The Hylian champion, Link, has appeared before us.
[3501.70s -> 3507.51s]  We have met numerous times, I'll have you know. Ah, so many memories. My mind is overflowing with
[3507.51s -> 3514.63s]  nostalgia, my friend. I had heard a terrible rumor that you had fallen in combat, but it appears you
[3514.71s -> 3525.72s]  managed to survive extraordinary. I've been sleeping. Oh, come again? Sleeping, you say. Hmm,
[3525.72s -> 3531.26s]  is that why you do not seem to remember me? Surely you must remember my precious daughter,
[3531.26s -> 3542.78s]  Mipha, yes? You do, do you not? Mipha who? I cannot believe it. You've truly forgotten my dear Mipha
[3542.78s -> 3549.10s]  as well. You and Mipha were close, yet you do not remember her. Young hero, please look upon the
[3549.10s -> 3554.78s]  beauty of Zora's domain. Do you see that statue? Was gazing upon Mipha's immortalized form still
[3554.78s -> 3564.63s]  to not jog your memory? Well, perhaps your memory will return in time. I dearly hope so. Father,
[3564.63s -> 3570.20s]  I do not believe discussing my sister is helping matters at the moment. Link sees confused. Oh,
[3570.76s -> 3576.23s]  yes, of course. But first, is it worth noting how remarkable is that to see you? I can't,
[3576.23s -> 3588.60s]  I can never say your name right. Sidon. That's quite a feat, my boy. That's a good one. Link,
[3588.60s -> 3594.41s]  I doubt not that you have endured a great many trials. Still, I must ask you to hear my plea.
[3594.41s -> 3597.77s]  Now then, hero, I must inform you that Zora's domain is in danger of vanishing because of
[3597.77s -> 3604.33s]  divine beast Fa-Ruto. I shall do you the courtesy of speaking bluntly. We are alone,
[3604.33s -> 3615.50s]  and we can't stop it alone. Will you lend us your strength? What? King Dorven, my liege,
[3615.50s -> 3621.08s]  please do not speak so. Ask a Hylian for help. Why, the very thought of it curls my fins.
[3622.34s -> 3628.74s]  Muzu, I expected more of you. How can you still protest? Muzu, it's rude to speak that way to
[3628.74s -> 3634.55s]  your king and his guest. Link is here because I invited him. With such unprecedented rainfall,
[3634.55s -> 3639.62s]  we have no choice but to rely on the aid of a trustworthy Hylian. Have we not already
[3639.62s -> 3644.86s]  discussed this and arrived at that very conclusion? He's the key to saving Zora's domain. I have no
[3644.86s -> 3650.73s]  doubt in my mind. Indeed, Link is a champion, through and through. As things now stand in Zora's
[3650.73s -> 3656.52s]  domain, nay, perhaps all of Hyrule is doomed to be swallowed by the sea. This is bigger than all of
[3656.52s -> 3660.76s]  us, my friend. Zora and Hylian's alike. We must put aside our differences and band together.
[3661.24s -> 3667.02s]  Have you forgotten already, my king? We cannot trust these lowly Hylians. A hundred years ago,
[3667.02s -> 3670.86s]  they abused the power of an ancient civilization and turned Hyrule into what it is today.
[3671.82s -> 3683.40s]  And that is not the least of it. It is their fault that Lady Mipha was lost to us.
[3683.40s -> 3692.41s]  Took a long time for him to figure that out. Oh, Link. Divine Beast of Avrunda has great power.
[3692.41s -> 3697.48s]  It has the unique ability to create an endless supply of water. Of late, it has been mercilessly
[3697.48s -> 3701.48s]  spouting water into the air. As a result, this area has been plagued by heavy rains.
[3702.94s -> 3709.21s]  Can I flip them? I'm gonna flip them. They think it makes more sense to me to flip these.
[3709.21s -> 3715.75s]  For us Zora, water and air are as water. So you would not think this would be quite so critical
[3715.75s -> 3722.62s]  of a problem. Sadly, the rains have filled the eastern reservoir nearly to the point of flooding.
[3722.62s -> 3729.06s]  If the reservoir bursts, as it soon will, I fear immense damage will befall not only Zora's domain,
[3729.62s -> 3735.22s]  but also the area downstream from us. There, Hylian lives are in very grave danger.
[3742.62s -> 3771.80s]  Divine... oops. What is this place? It's like Bill Clinton. Whoa, look at this thing.
[3787.50s -> 3795.82s]  Divine Beast of Avrunda, your Princess Zelda, often studied the Divine Beasts. That is in the
[3795.82s -> 3802.17s]  time before the Great Calamity. According to her research, the orbs located on Avrunda's shoulders
[3802.73s -> 3807.77s]  are mechanisms that can control the water it generates. However, they require electricity
[3807.77s -> 3812.87s]  to work. These orbs are clearly out of control now because there's no electricity cursing through
[3812.87s -> 3819.35s]  to stop them. Now second, it was quite shock resistant for Zora. Hit one with a shock arrow,
[3819.35s -> 3825.80s]  sure enough, it slowed the water down a bit. Unfortunately, as an aquatic race, we Zora are
[3825.80s -> 3830.90s]  terribly vulnerable to the power of electricity. Perhaps because we could not safely strike it
[3830.90s -> 3836.02s]  with enough electricity at once, the water soon returned to its full force. That is why I went in
[3836.02s -> 3840.76s]  search of a Hylian who could help us. Link, I'm certain you have already figured this out, but
[3841.64s -> 3846.94s]  we need you to use shock arrows to get those orbs working properly again. I will aid you in any way
[3846.94s -> 3852.78s]  that I can, of course. Please, Hero, I beg of you, help me stop Brutus' rampage of destruction.
[3856.58s -> 3862.86s]  What? Princess Zelda herself instructed you to board a Divine Beast and if he's from within?
[3862.86s -> 3870.66s]  So then Princess Zelda is still alive? Yes, in Hyrule Castle. I don't have a voice for Link.
[3870.66s -> 3875.40s]  I do not believe it. She was alive this whole time, just as you were. The events of a hundred
[3875.40s -> 3880.62s]  years ago cannot be altered if it is true, but if we can regain control of the Divine Beasts,
[3880.62s -> 3886.82s]  they may yet prove useful in sealing Calamity Ganon once and for all. I did not know they had
[3886.82s -> 3893.14s]  such grand ambitions, Link. Wondrous. Naturally, I shall help too. Once it has stopped rampaging,
[3893.14s -> 3900.12s]  you can easily climb inside it. Come, Link, let us appease Ruta together. Thank you, Link.
[3900.12s -> 3905.88s]  Truly, we are in your debt. Our goal is the same. That means our meeting was nothing short of
[3905.88s -> 3914.18s]  destiny. Now then, allow me to offer you this gift of a sure fate. Zora Arbor! Custom arbor,
[3914.18s -> 3919.29s]  painstakingly crafted by each generation Zora Princess for her future husband. Wearing it will
[3919.29s -> 3925.37s]  give you the ability to swim up waterfalls. As long as you wear this, you can swim up waterfalls.
[3925.45s -> 3931.80s]  Just like I said, please take care of it. King Dorfen! Surely you do not really
[3931.80s -> 3936.55s]  intend to give this outsider a Zora armor. Countless generations of Zora Princesses have
[3936.55s -> 3941.96s]  gifted that armor to the one they have sworn to marry. Princess Mipha made that one there with
[3941.96s -> 3951.64s]  her own hands. It is far too important to entrust to a shady Hylian. He may be champion, but Mipha
[3951.64s -> 3957.29s]  had no such relationship with him, so why should he receive such an honor? This is just too much,
[3957.29s -> 3963.98s]  my liege. I do not understand it one bit. That ruseur is not easily swayed when his mind is set.
[3964.70s -> 3970.02s]  You must understand he was in charge of educating my dear daughter Mipha. Naturally,
[3970.02s -> 3977.27s]  she means a lot to him. Just as she means a lot to me and the world, too. Ever since we lost her to
[3977.27s -> 3985.27s]  the Calamity, he has grown despising. He grew up and he despised Hylians. I hope we can forgive
[3985.27s -> 3992.90s]  his rudeness. But what shall we do now? I tasked Muzu with finding the shock arrows we need to
[3992.90s -> 4003.96s]  appease Varuta. Now he has rushed off in a huff. Link, do not let his words concern you. I will
[4003.96s -> 4013.90s]  work this out with Muzu. I shall return shortly. Oh, here we go. Okay. I'm gonna head downstairs
[4013.90s -> 4021.10s]  real quick. There we are. These are steep stairs. Sidon, I suppose that means you are going to tell
[4021.10s -> 4029.94s]  him. Link Muzu is most likely at the square down below. Do you mind going down there? I would
[4029.94s -> 4044.06s]  like you to try to speak with him. Somebody said down there was like a SpongeBob episode?
[4045.03s -> 4070.84s]  What? Awful joke. Oh, hold on. You came all the way here, but it was in vain. I have no desire
[4070.84s -> 4077.08s]  to speak with you. Listen well, Muzu. There's something you need to know. He who stands here,
[4077.08s -> 4083.40s]  the man called Link, is the one who my sister Mipha had feelings for. I was only a child,
[4083.40s -> 4088.94s]  so I did not know it myself at the time, but it is so. I grew up hearing my father tell stories,
[4089.50s -> 4092.94s]  some of which were about my sister's undying love for a Hylian named Link.
[4094.90s -> 4105.42s]  What? No! You cannot fool me with such a fanciful lie, not Miss Sora. How could Lady Mipha possibly
[4105.42s -> 4111.30s]  have feelings for a Hylian like him? The facts are clear. He remembers nothing. Even when he looks
[4111.30s -> 4118.46s]  upon Princess Mipha's statue. It's the truth, Muzu, though you never knew it. He was ever in Mipha's
[4118.46s -> 4162.86s]  heart. I was thinking. This reminds me of the time. Well, I can't do it, but I'll show up.
[4162.86s -> 4171.29s]  You were just a reckless child, always getting yourself hurt at every turn. Every time,
[4171.29s -> 4182.34s]  I would heal you, just as I'm doing right now. Funny how, being a Hylian, you looked grown up
[4182.34s -> 4206.73s]  so much faster than I did. I was always willing to heal your wounds, even back then. So if this
[4206.73s -> 4214.09s]  Calamity Ganon does in fact return, what can we really do? We just don't seem to know much
[4214.09s -> 4222.01s]  about what we'll be up against. But know this, that no matter how difficult this battle night gets,
[4222.81s -> 4231.61s]  if you, if anyone ever tries to do you harm, then I will heal you. No matter when,
[4232.17s -> 4238.46s]  or how bad the wound, I hope you know that I will always protect you.
[4239.42s -> 4246.49s]  Once this whole thing is over, maybe things can go back to how they used to be when we were young.
[4247.45s -> 4258.63s]  You know, perhaps we could spend some time together. All I'm saying is, I mean,
[4258.63s -> 4263.35s]  you give me a full suit of armor, a dagger, and three grenades, and I would do it. I'd be fine.
[4266.60s -> 4281.14s]  And like five bologna and cheese sandwiches, and I would, I would save the day here. I would do it
[4282.10s -> 4290.22s]  in three days. Okay.
[4319.08s -> 4330.81s]  Sorry, that was a long cutscene. I just need to run around the circle for a second. All right,
[4330.81s -> 4337.53s]  so I need to bring you proof that I know who this is. Step in fool lucky for us, we have proof.
[4337.53s -> 4341.61s]  Link, go ahead and show Muzu the Zora armor my father gave you. Wasn't he in the room?
[4342.41s -> 4348.55s]  Wait, wasn't this guy in the room when I got the armor? I want you to prove to me that you have,
[4348.55s -> 4355.58s]  that you knew who we are. Link, here's the armor. How would you get that? Oh, I like you. Wait,
[4355.58s -> 4373.16s]  I don't get it. I have to put it on? You were in the room when you want, when he gave it to me.
[4373.16s -> 4379.11s]  Oh, it has to activate. I get it. Okay. You really think changing your clothes is going to make me?
[4384.78s -> 4390.22s]  That's the Zora armor from before. It even made that by hand and it fits you perfectly.
[4390.94s -> 4398.78s]  What's the meaning of this? Now you understand, do you not? Now you know who her heart belonged
[4398.78s -> 4406.46s]  to and who she made this special armor for. Oh my goodness. How could it be another men's small?
[4406.46s -> 4416.33s]  No way. It's impossible. I don't know how. Now the fact that this armor fits Link perfectly should
[4416.33s -> 4422.33s]  be made proof that Mipha made it for him and him alone. You've always disliked Hylians even
[4422.33s -> 4428.66s]  before the Great Calamity. That is why Mipha never told you. Now that you know, you must promise to
[4428.66s -> 4434.65s]  help him save us all. Please, tell us where we can find the shock arrows we need. Knowing you,
[4434.65s -> 4439.30s]  I bet you have already figured it out. Never would have imagined she would make that special
[4439.30s -> 4453.86s]  armor for someone such as her. I do not approve of asking for help from a Hylian,
[4453.86s -> 4458.82s]  but I suppose it is our only option at this point. I am a proud Zora. That means I must take
[4458.82s -> 4463.54s]  responsibility for my unwarranted behavior towards you. As promised, I shall tell you
[4463.54s -> 4472.73s]  where you can collect as many shock arrows as you will ever need. That tall mountain over yonder,
[4472.73s -> 4478.44s]  it's called Floymus Mountain, and there you will find Shatterback Point. A terrifying creature has
[4478.44s -> 4483.90s]  made its home up there. This awful beast shoots volley after volley of shock arrows. Even a single
[4483.90s -> 4493.35s]  one could be fatal to a Zora. Aha! You must mean that...Lino. He is a man-beast, that one.
[4493.35s -> 4499.48s]  That beast does indeed wield shock arrows. Certainly one way to collect them. He's vicious,
[4499.48s -> 4504.76s]  to be sure, but I am certain Link will rise to the challenge. In order to reprove the divine beast,
[4504.76s -> 4507.96s]  I estimate that you will need at least 20 shock arrows. Do you think you can gather that many
[4507.96s -> 4515.69s]  shock arrows? Why do you still doubt him? I know Delta would be triumphant. Okay, Link, let's go.
[4516.65s -> 4521.06s]  Fastest way to Plyymus Mountain is to ascend the waterfall east of the domain,
[4521.06s -> 4526.46s]  and Zora armor should come in handy. Just swim up the waterfall, and then go up to the waterfall.
[4528.22s -> 4533.98s]  I'll wait at East Reservoir Lake, right by the divine beast. Gather at least 20 shock arrows,
[4533.98s -> 4540.20s]  then come join me. Okay, wonderful. Together we shall stop that divine beast's onslaught.
[4540.76s -> 4562.82s]  Just made the most scrumptious cake. All right, let's do it. You guys remember like three years
[4562.82s -> 4572.74s]  ago when I would do the Neelix impression every two streams? I was on that for a long time. I did
[4572.74s -> 4576.58s]  it every two or three streams. I said it like five times a stream. I was obsessed with it.
[4577.38s -> 4589.26s]  Good morning. Welcome to Marot Mart. This is where you'll find our general store. Okay, cool.
[4589.82s -> 4612.74s]  Cool. Let's look at the store. Wait, this is not the store? This is the store. What do you got?
[4614.39s -> 4630.84s]  Violet? Salt? Oh, I think I need some salt. I'll take them all. 48 rupees. Excuse me? 48 rupees?
[4639.42s -> 4654.50s]  I don't have to pay for that, right? Hey, you're a Hylian, aren't you? It's rare to see your kind
[4654.50s -> 4663.88s]  around here. As for me, I was roaming nearby during my travels when Prince
[4664.52s -> 4668.84s]  Sidon recruited me and brought me here. That's because I can touch shock arrows,
[4669.40s -> 4675.32s]  but I also weigh you well a lot, so there's no way I'll be able to carry you on my back.
[4676.20s -> 4680.36s]  That's what Prince Sidon said to me. That's kind of rude of him, doesn't it?
[4683.00s -> 4690.58s]  Voice acting! How about this one? If I'm going to do some voice acting, why not? Let's do
[4690.58s -> 4696.22s]  how about this one? I told her the Hylian who stole Lady B for a way things. She can just come
[4696.30s -> 4701.21s]  wandering in here like nothing happened. What business do you have after all these years?
[4703.54s -> 4711.14s]  Oh, it's the weapons workshop. Oh, cool. Okay. What are you doing? Well, I tried maintenance,
[4711.14s -> 4721.48s]  you know. Oh, nice. Okay. Well, good night. See you. What other voices can I do? Oh, how about
[4721.48s -> 4726.28s]  you? I got to do the voice acting. I don't know. Pardon me. Could you please get out of the way?
[4729.43s -> 4739.29s]  Oh, good morning. Who are you? I'm a Hylian. Oh, sorry. If you're a Hylian,
[4739.93s -> 4749.10s]  did you come from far away? I asked because. Oh, never mind. My dad told me not to talk to strangers.
[4749.10s -> 4761.80s]  I can do one thing. I can literally do one thing. Oh, it's you. Oh, wait. There's a quest here. Hold
[4761.80s -> 4779.27s]  on. Okay. You need materials. What kind? Luminous stone. I think I already have these, don't I?
[4783.67s -> 4786.31s]  If you have 10 of them, that would be a big help. I think I already have that.
[4786.87s -> 4797.05s]  Here are the stones. Thank you. All right. Is this like, should I not do this?
[4799.32s -> 4824.87s]  And a one and a two and a three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. What a bunch of
[4824.87s -> 4834.71s]  bullshit. Okay. All right. So I need to, this is where we go. Collect arrows. What's the fastest
[4834.71s -> 4846.02s]  way to get up here? I imagine from where I am, right? I want to cook some food though.
[4846.90s -> 4859.24s]  I'm not just going there. I need to cook some food. Where's the chef? What do you have to say?
[4859.24s -> 4868.34s]  What was it again? I'm just kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Go to the waterfall.
[4868.98s -> 4881.69s]  I should get some more arrows. I'll buy some of these. These are useful. The fish too. Yeah.
[4882.25s -> 4906.18s]  Take the whole thing. XD. Oh my God. You're such a kidder. I know. I think I'm going to buy all the
[4906.18s -> 4914.33s]  regular arrows. How much is it for everything? Yeah. I'll take them all. Swim up the waterfall.
[4915.46s -> 4920.47s]  Yeah. I want to cook food first though. Make some cold elixir things or something.
[4921.11s -> 4977.30s]  How do you cook food here? In? Top left. Top right. Right. West. Hello. You are Link, right?
[4977.30s -> 4986.15s]  What do you ask? Prince Sidon ran off through the eastern gate. He was shouting something like,
[4986.71s -> 4990.76s]  I'm off to stop the divine beast. Link the Hylian is coming with me.
[4991.32s -> 4996.36s]  I assume that means you're going up Ploymus Mountain in search of shock arrows. Yes.
[4997.08s -> 5008.38s]  I have a request. What is it? There's a red maned monster called a Lionel that lives on Ploymus
[5008.38s -> 5016.07s]  Mountain. I really need a picture of a Lionel. Any of any red maned Lionel. Not just the one on
[5016.07s -> 5028.50s]  the mountain. What do you say? Can you give me a picture? Sure. Okay. There's this fool in the
[5028.50s -> 5033.22s]  domain who goads people into jumping off Shatterback Point on Ploymus Mountain.
[5033.22s -> 5036.82s]  It's an incredibly dangerous jump and this guy pressures people into jumping off by questioning
[5036.82s -> 5041.30s]  their courage. He's a real bottom feeder. If this keeps up, someone is surely going to wind up
[5041.30s -> 5046.36s]  horribly injured. I need a picture of a Lionel to show everyone how scary they are. Maybe people
[5046.36s -> 5050.76s]  will stop going up there. Does that answer your question? I'll leave the details to you. Just
[5050.76s -> 5060.62s]  bring me a picture. I mean, I don't want to keep my own horn or anything, but how about I leave
[5060.62s -> 5065.98s]  the camera with you? I go on the top of the mountain and I'm going to dive off that mountain.
[5065.98s -> 5095.85s]  You get a picture of me halfway down. I'll do a flip. Go to the inn. What happened? No! Please climb
[5095.85s -> 5130.54s]  it. Nobody saw that. How do I? I'm just teleporting back up here. What the fuck, dude? Title update?
[5130.54s -> 5153.66s]  Oh shit, the title is the same. I want to cook. Read the clothing. Swim up waterfalls. Okay. Yeah,
[5153.66s -> 5167.21s]  I know. Yeah, I know. I just want to cook. So somebody said go to the inn. All right. Is there
[5167.21s -> 5178.65s]  a chef pot here? There's a chef pot right there. All right. Nice. Here we go. I got a lot of shit
[5178.65s -> 5191.94s]  to make. So long lasting flame for using your firewood. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Elixir
[5191.94s -> 5204.74s]  ingredient. I make elixirs. Okay. Cook dishes that will allow you to endure the cold. So let
[5204.74s -> 5220.34s]  me hold this with these. Um, cook it with monster part. Oh, let me do that. Um, stop holding.
[5220.34s -> 5229.86s]  Monster parts. This is a monster part, right? So if I do, how many of these should I put in together?
[5229.86s -> 5236.47s]  So this is technically a monster part. So what is the, what's, what's the ratio I should do?
[5236.47s -> 5252.26s]  So, okay. How many bat wings, how many monster parts do I need to have? Why'd you just make me
[5252.26s -> 5260.71s]  press Y? Now I don't know where the fuck I just was. What the heck. Okay. So should I just do one
[5260.71s -> 5267.56s]  in one? What would happen if I did two bat wings and one lizard? What's the difference? What happens?
[5267.56s -> 5276.44s]  Always do 50-50. One-to-one is fine. There were two huge raids that just, that came in. Granny came
[5276.44s -> 5284.49s]  in with a thousand people and then lots of monster parts. Okay. And then Ramola. That was, that's
[5284.49s -> 5294.71s]  how, those are monster raids. Welcome everybody. Ramola? Am I saying that right? What's up? Thanks
[5294.71s -> 5304.44s]  to the raids guys. Everybody. Welcome. Welcome guys. Raid song. There you go. No, we need to
[5304.44s -> 5308.38s]  kill that meme. No more of that. I don't want you guys doing that. I don't want you guys singing
[5308.38s -> 5315.77s]  that. We're killing that meme today. But no, thanks. Thanks for the raids. Hope you had a good stream,
[5315.77s -> 5322.62s]  whatever you're doing. We're playing Breath of the Wild and I'm trying to figure out how to cook food
[5322.62s -> 5328.02s]  because I don't get it. I mean, I do get it, but I don't. All right. I'm going to do two bat wings
[5328.02s -> 5353.37s]  and two lizards. That makes sense to me. Okay. Two bat wings and two lizards. What does it do?
[5353.37s -> 5361.16s]  420. Boost your movement speed while running. Wasn't it cold? Okay. Now let me cook some other
[5361.16s -> 5366.79s]  shit too. When cooked into a dish, temporarily increases your maximum hearts. All right. Let's
[5366.79s -> 5395.50s]  put that in here. So I only do one effect. Some salt and that's it. All right. Nice. That's awesome.
[5395.50s -> 5415.40s]  Okay. I need to make some more. What's this? Electrical resistance. A fucking apple, two
[5415.40s -> 5436.70s]  mushrooms and a third mushroom. Four minutes of electricity resistance. Okay. Now what? Cook one
[5436.70s -> 5456.60s]  radish and see what happens. Jesus. What? Why would you ever make another food? Would you ever
[5456.60s -> 5479.46s]  make another food for any reason? Radish it out. Yeah. Okay. What about meat? Double meat and I have
[5479.46s -> 5511.74s]  too much stealth bullshit. Meat, herbs. Oh, and electricity mushroom and banana. Two mushrooms.
[5511.74s -> 5544.28s]  No, some salt. Whatever. Electro mushroom skewer. All right. This one's cold. Three of these. Okay.
[5544.28s -> 5550.36s]  Mushrooms. This is going to be cool. So things that increase cold resistance. This is a guava.
[5550.36s -> 5566.95s]  I need more cold resistance. Heat resistance. Oh, okay. This is going to be fished. This is going
[5566.95s -> 5583.66s]  to be crazy. It's going to be like 40 minutes. 10 minutes. That's a big one. All right. Hold on.
[5583.66s -> 5614.74s]  Just truffles individually here too. Yeah. That's pretty good. Cook one pepper. Too many. Don't eat
[5614.74s -> 5622.07s]  these because it's not going to, you don't have that many hearts. Make an electro mushroom risotto.
[5622.07s -> 5637.27s]  What does milk do? Okay. Let's do, I didn't want to eat that. I wanted to pull. I don't know why I did
[5637.27s -> 5653.26s]  that. Eating raw wheat, whatever this is, rice. Okay. So then I need, what else do I got? Attack
[5653.26s -> 5674.44s]  power. Double banana. This is going to be gross. Ooh. Four minutes of attack power. Increases defense.
[5674.44s -> 5686.50s]  Oh, check this out. This is defense, right? What about a crab? This is going to be,
[5686.50s -> 5723.51s]  this is a high level defense boost of four minutes. Two and a half minutes of low level. That's all
[5723.51s -> 5742.15s]  right. Movement speed. All right. What if I do three of these? A little dash of salt. Not very
[5742.15s -> 5773.30s]  much. Not very much. Kind of running out of food to mix here. Purple mushroom. Oh my goodness. All
[5773.30s -> 5779.03s]  right. Yeah. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Back up. Stop holding. Let's do this again
[5779.03s -> 5798.81s]  because let's do two of these and three of these. Okay. Cook it with monster parts to draw out its
[5798.81s -> 5811.38s]  speed boost effect. I don't think that works. All right. Let's try this. Honey mushroom. All
[5811.38s -> 5818.31s]  right. This is five minutes of high level movement speed. It does it just in elixirs, not in food.
[5818.31s -> 5851.02s]  Okay. Okay. Rice, milk, salt, bitter cold. Why don't we just make, why don't we do all five? Wait,
[5851.02s -> 5861.42s]  what's the, isn't there a crab or something that has cold resistance? Stamina. Attack power.
[5861.42s -> 5868.95s]  Silently. Fish here. And salt. Let's go. I mean, I have so much food. It doesn't go bad, right?
[5868.95s -> 5881.75s]  11 minutes of mid-level cold. All right. Uh, VR Josh has a good point. I should make stuff that
[5881.75s -> 5921.99s]  heals for like four or five so I don't just have a bunch of omega food. That's good. What about
[5921.99s -> 5941.13s]  just cooking one fish? This is a waste. Kind of a waste. What about this? Five snails. Whatever
[5941.13s -> 5957.21s]  this is. 10 minutes of low level stealth boost. I'm, I can, let's make some elixirs. All right.
[5957.21s -> 5982.63s]  Frog. Uh, monster parts. Tail and horn. Let's try it. That was a good one, I guess.
[5982.63s -> 6021.88s]  Oh, it says healing on it too. Okay. Stamina recovery elixir. That was a good one too,
[6021.88s -> 6048.94s]  apparently. All right. I think I'm good. Heat resistance. Attack power. Stamina. Stealth.
[6048.94s -> 6077.82s]  Defense. Stealth. Okay. Defense. Defense. Stamina. That's good, right? What else was defense?
[6077.82s -> 6100.28s]  Something else was here, right? Salt. Salt. And the crab. The one that, it'll, uh, it'll negate
[6100.28s -> 6120.42s]  the other thing, right? Make it extra salty? Okay. I'm gonna hold off the rest. I have a lot of food.
[6120.42s -> 6133.21s]  Look at all this food. That fits so much. Yeah, look at all this. How about a tree nut, two milks,
[6133.21s -> 6151.53s]  a rice, and a mushroom. Here's your mushroom risotto. I think I got enough food and I have,
[6151.53s -> 6161.05s]  I have plenty of really good items. I'm kind of decked out right now. I got plenty of food.
[6161.05s -> 6178.54s]  So now go swim up the waterfall. How far away is this waterfall?
[6178.54s -> 6212.54s]  Where's this waterfall that it's talking about? Save the game. Good call. East. Is that it right
[6212.54s -> 6246.73s]  there? Yeah, that's it right there. Oh, God damn it. Can we please get a Zoinks? Fine.
[6273.99s -> 6280.04s]  Like, Zoinks, Scoob. I fucking banned that person. I actually banned that person for like an hour
[6280.04s -> 6284.90s]  because they just made me do that and I fucking hated it. I want that person banned for an hour.
[6284.90s -> 6292.54s]  That's what I'm saying. That was like not good. It was like kind of annoying and it looked bad
[6292.54s -> 6298.70s]  and like I did it wrong. I want that person timed over an hour. I genuinely want that person banned.
[6299.26s -> 6316.01s]  It was good. No time that okay, maybe not an hour, but at least five minutes.
[6316.01s -> 6360.17s]  Hold on. So I need to get up there and walk across this bridge. One thing you can say about
[6360.17s -> 6368.47s]  Germa is he moisturizes. You get over 35 and you tell me if it's time to start moisturizing.
[6369.03s -> 6401.19s]  But I had this equipped. Actually, I need those arrows. That's good. I started moisturizing
[6401.19s -> 6407.93s]  because of you. You know, there is one thing that I will say. If there's a few things that
[6407.93s -> 6415.96s]  people will take from this stream, don't forget about anything else, right? Drink more water.
[6416.92s -> 6420.12s]  Don't drink too much water though. It's like you don't have to be sitting there chugging it.
[6421.48s -> 6426.84s]  Moisturize when you get out of the shower. Just a light moisturizer for your face. Just put it on.
[6426.84s -> 6432.98s]  It takes two seconds. It takes two seconds. When you get out of the shower, dry your face,
[6432.98s -> 6438.04s]  get a nice face moisturizer. It takes just a little bit and just smear it on. That's it.
[6438.04s -> 6480.54s]  You're done. Okay, so I can swim up this. Whoa, that's interesting. Cool. Damn, 37. How do you
[6480.54s -> 6487.02s]  deal with getting older? Honestly, you just do. You just, everyone gets older. That's it.
[6490.14s -> 6493.90s]  There is no, oh, I have to like, you know, you just, everyone's going to get older.
[6493.90s -> 6501.22s]  Eventually you get old, but as long as you just keep a good mindset,
[6501.86s -> 6506.42s]  moisturize, drink some water, eat, eat okay. I don't eat the best, right?
[6513.02s -> 6516.94s]  I know that food pyramid thing I did the other, like a year ago was a meme, but you know,
[6520.10s -> 6526.55s]  you know, just take care of yourself. Take care of yourself enough because honestly,
[6526.55s -> 6532.07s]  like taking care of yourself so much to the point where it almost becomes like a job on its own too.
[6533.62s -> 6538.10s]  Right? Like paying attention to how healthy you are, what you're eating. No, I can't eat that.
[6538.10s -> 6545.14s]  I don't want to eat that. It's bad for me. It can be kind of hard, but just take care of yourself
[6545.14s -> 6553.37s]  as, as well as you can. But enjoy life too. Enjoy shit. You want to eat a triple cheeseburger one
[6553.37s -> 6567.98s]  day? Do it. Don't do it every day. Just do it whenever you feel like it. Turning 30 in a week,
[6567.98s -> 6573.02s]  you have any wise words? No, you'll be fine. You'll be fine. Just once you get over 30,
[6573.66s -> 6579.16s]  you're going to, you kind of, you, I don't know, you kind of unplug from the matrix and you're just
[6579.16s -> 6584.62s]  like, Oh, whatever. Wait, that's a bad reference. That means that that's okay. Hold on. Let me redo
[6584.62s -> 6619.42s]  that. Who is this? That's good, right? They're going to find this on my dead body. Oh my goodness.
[6619.42s -> 6627.30s]  You almost killed me in one fucking hit defense. I'm going to do defense. Where's my defense food?
[6630.38s -> 6633.58s]  Health. This is, which one is he's a defense? This one here, right?
[6634.39s -> 6660.46s]  All right. Two and a half minutes of mid-level defense boost. Let's go. I got it. It can't do
[6660.46s -> 6678.94s]  anything. I feel like that didn't even negate any damage. I got the picture, right? That one is
[6678.94s -> 6710.65s]  actually better. Can I at least get one hit? Let me try to get one swing on this guy. Don't fight.
[6710.65s -> 6734.10s]  Why not? So is it a horizontal or vertical swing? Okay. Okay. I can fight this. I can kill this for
[6734.10s -> 6746.04s]  sure. This is a dodge better. I have to dodge better. It's two horizontal swings. That's it.
[6746.04s -> 6829.38s]  He's standing in water. Are you kidding me? Shut up. What was that? What are you doing?
[6830.42s -> 6851.35s]  I'm going to break every weapon on this guy. This is actually bad, isn't it? These are all my cool
[6851.35s -> 6915.16s]  weapons. What if every single one of them breaks? Whatever. Let's go. No, thanks. I'm all right. I'm
[6915.16s -> 6934.76s]  okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. I don't want to eat the high-level one. I think I just want to heal.
[6934.76s -> 6981.11s]  Just heal. That's it. Everything is so good. I'm going to eat this. Let's go. Got him. It's
[6981.11s -> 6992.47s]  larger and heavier than a horse's hoof. It's useful for making elixirs. Wait. Look what I did,
[6992.47s -> 7003.38s]  right? I have to prove that I did this. Otherwise, I don't think that she'll believe me. Wait. Yeah.
[7003.38s -> 7015.24s]  I don't know. It's going to be a selfie. Otherwise, how can I prove? Wait. Well,
[7015.24s -> 7030.36s]  you didn't even kill it. Yes, I did. Lionel's sword. 24. Oh, man. I'm going to hide. Oh, shit.
[7030.36s -> 7043.16s]  What is 10 times three? Three arrows? This thing's almost broken. Just get rid of it.
[7046.62s -> 7065.64s]  I can't throw this away. Whatever. Oh, it's a bow. I'm an idiot. And then Lionel's shield.
[7066.28s -> 7083.24s]  I can really only... Okay. Wait a minute. Which one of these is better? Am I just wasting the
[7083.24s -> 7088.98s]  get rid of one of the guardian shields? That feels terrible. It's only the number that matters. Okay.
[7089.91s -> 7095.10s]  Just jest the number that it's only the ma... It's only the number that matters.
[7095.10s -> 7100.62s]  Oh, look at how cool this is though. All right. I'll get rid of it.
[7101.18s -> 7126.95s]  What is it? Keep the phrenic bow. What should I get rid of instead? The Lysal bow? Soldier's bow?
[7127.51s -> 7134.89s]  Phrenic is good. Phrenic is good for long range. Okay. Should I get rid of the
[7135.77s -> 7148.92s]  soldier's bow? Soldier's bow sucks. Okay. Well, that was cool. I killed it and I got the
[7148.92s -> 7158.50s]  sword and shit. Let's see what it looks like. 24. Very cool. All right. Let's go.
[7159.14s -> 7189.51s]  Here are the shock arrows. I need 20 of these. Shock arrow. Oh, what am I doing? Okay. Take a
[7189.51s -> 7253.80s]  picture of it and then set the beep beep for it. That's what I should be doing. Go. Okay. I didn't
[7253.80s -> 7259.83s]  do this at all in my playthrough. I am going to tell you I probably won't do it that much in mine
[7259.83s -> 7306.20s]  either because I will forget it exists. Okay. How many do I have now? Oh shit. There's a million
[7306.20s -> 7330.06s]  up here. What's this? Oh, this is the jump point. Wait, that's the guardian right there.
[7330.06s -> 7364.98s]  That's the guardian right there. I'm not ready. I need 20. I have 18. I need 20, right? Where are
[7364.98s -> 7386.65s]  they? Oh, they're up. They're not just in the base of the trees. All right. There's 20 right here.
[7386.65s -> 7403.72s]  All right. I have 20 arrows. It wasn't 25, right? Save, save, save, save, save, save, save. 20,
[7403.72s -> 7453.16s]  but the more the better. Well, I might as well be prepared, right? Take it, man. Take it.
[7454.20s -> 7512.20s]  Take it. I think I got them all. I believe that. Oh, no. Is it once in this tree higher? Oh, sorry.
[7512.20s -> 7518.58s]  All right. I think that's good. I'm ready. I'm going to go fight the first divine beast of the
[7518.58s -> 7597.86s]  game. The divine, um, elephant, I think. Let's go jump at your own risk. Um, what was that? What's
[7597.86s -> 7696.07s]  your problem into the, um, steam or something? I'm not losing those two hearts. Not happening.
[7696.07s -> 7708.17s]  Okay. Well, the quest marker is over here. So I'm imagining maybe I have to go to like the dock or
[7708.17s -> 7737.77s]  something. Is there a dock over here? Oh, okay. Sidon is right here. There we go. All right. So I
[7737.77s -> 7748.04s]  have my shock arrows equipped. I have, I want my strong bow and Knight's bow equipped. I'm ready
[7748.04s -> 7762.58s]  to do this. Let's go. Glad to see you ready to go, Link. Are you ready for this? Do you have your
[7762.58s -> 7771.13s]  Zora armor and enough shock arrows? Let us go and appease that divine beast. Here we go.
[7779.24s -> 7797.62s]  Gaze now upon the divine beast's back. Shoot the glowing pink orbs with a shock arrow. Okay.
[7799.80s -> 7803.16s]  I shall take you right up to the side of the divine beast. And from there, you can swim and
[7803.16s -> 7813.45s]  take aim. I know you can do it. I believe in you. Hurry up and get on my back. Good answer. Here we
[7813.45s -> 7833.62s]  go. Full speed. It's up to you. Ward off the attacks. Are you ready? Divine beast Varuna will
[7833.62s -> 7839.08s]  undoubtedly use its ancient laser and that includes hurling giant ice blocks.
[7841.27s -> 7852.60s]  Let's go. He talks. How am I going to watch that ice? How do I, how do I stop the ice?
[7860.86s -> 7892.76s]  Sidon, I haven't blocked one. Hey, how do I stop the ice? Okay. I made him hit his head.
[7893.56s -> 7901.94s]  Oh, fuck. I think I'm missing something here. Oh, I can shatter it. I can shatter them.
[7907.19s -> 7940.58s]  Shatter it. Oh my God. I'm restarting. Yeah. Get up there. Oh, help. Help. Help.
[7949.22s -> 7981.32s]  You let me drown, dude. What the hell? Okay. All right. That's it. Sidon, where are you?
[7989.98s -> 7993.75s]  Stop swimming around and stop doing this.
[7999.54s -> 8061.32s]  Bro, there ain't nothing here. Oh, I got it. Get this fucking blue shell out of here.
[8061.40s -> 8101.54s]  Ready. Got them all. Now it's time. What an absolute thrill. Oh, that was the rain. Okay.
[8101.54s -> 8112.60s]  That's cool. Floating higher. You wanted to venture inside of it, right? I'll bring you close.
[8112.60s -> 8127.02s]  Counting on you. Do good work in there. I have to go inside. This is not just a boss.
[8130.68s -> 8134.07s]  Here we are. Looks like this is where the real work starts.
[8135.03s -> 8139.94s]  Best of luck. Nice job cutting off the water flow from this divine beast.
[8140.66s -> 8162.04s]  Show the enemy no fear. I'll see you back at Zora's domain. Farewell. This thing's pissed.
[8184.63s -> 8194.07s]  Do I have my five bologna sandwiches? Three grenades and a dagger. Oh, and I got an iPod.
[8194.07s -> 8201.11s]  Just give me an iPod with like the entire Bill Burr podcast on it.
[8201.67s -> 8203.78s]  Arrow's every episode. I'll be good.
[8262.02s -> 8278.66s]  All right. So this is just a big shrine. Okay. If you hit the eye, the eye closes.
[8290.66s -> 8317.58s]  Interesting. Cool. Okay. Okay. So an eye right here. Shock arrow.
[8319.85s -> 8344.06s]  I can't electrify the water. I'm standing in, right? This is the first real dungeon. Good luck.
[8345.80s -> 8368.81s]  So would you say that these dungeons are more traditional Zelda? Divine beast controls have
[8368.81s -> 8377.62s]  been enabled. Yes. Okay. No. A lot more yeses than nos. Good. You've obtained the map of the
[8377.62s -> 8383.58s]  divine beast. You will see several glowing points on your map, which represent the terminals that
[8383.58s -> 8397.30s]  control Ruta. Take Ruta back by activating all of the terminals. Be careful. Okay. Whoa.
[8401.64s -> 8411.64s]  That's very interesting. Okay. So where am I? All right. There's a thing down here. I can manipulate
[8411.64s -> 8465.19s]  move trunk. Wait, wait, what? Okay. What's in here? Okay. Use my Sheikah tablet. Remember,
[8465.19s -> 8474.68s]  this is the first playthrough. Yeah, it is. Okay. So this is where the main control unit is. So I
[8474.68s -> 8481.46s]  gotta remember that where his butt is, right? This is where the main control valve is. Please
[8481.46s -> 8488.66s]  remember that because I won't. All right. So I am here. I'm going to bang a right.
[8488.66s -> 8507.27s]  I need to go this way. Oh, wait, what's this? Oh, this can, this, this can be manipulated. Oh,
[8507.27s -> 8538.57s]  this can be manipulated. It's going to fall, isn't it? Thank you. You fucking idiot. Okay.
[8543.58s -> 8583.86s]  This one. So now I gotta go. It's like I gotta go up a level this way. So they were preparing
[8583.86s -> 8600.39s]  me for this fight. Oh, these things probably drop like crazy now. Right. All right. Cool.
[8600.95s -> 8612.06s]  I love the way these look. I'm buying one of these off Etsy. You bet your ass I am. Okay.
[8613.02s -> 8632.70s]  So now I got this thing here. Well, the room, they're going to make this thing turn. What
[8632.70s -> 8657.29s]  if I stopped this? Can I? It's on Etsy right now. It's on it. Nobody buy that. There's only one of
[8657.29s -> 8688.38s]  them left. Don't buy that one. That thing looks awesome. Only one left. No one buy that. What
[8688.38s -> 8695.37s]  about out here? Maybe I can't do anything with it yet. Do I have to get inside? Oh, I know what to
[8695.37s -> 8718.31s]  do. Now you're thinking of a gas. I don't know why I went like this. Now you're working with gas.
[8718.31s -> 8756.50s]  Why did I like tilt my head this way? Hmm. How do I move this though? Well, I'm going to get this
[8762.14s -> 8777.94s]  hundred rupees. All right. I'll take it. I try to stop the flow of water. What can I even manipulate
[8777.94s -> 8792.62s]  here? I can manipulate this shit. Wait a minute. Can I just get in here? I don't think I can just
[8792.62s -> 8814.92s]  get in there. Shit. I know I said, give me three grenades. What would I do? What would I use them
[8814.92s -> 8820.38s]  for? I would go through all five sandwiches and just be starving in here and be like, I should
[8820.38s -> 8826.90s]  have asked for more sandwiches. Why don't I bring the grenades? I would be desperately asking for
[8826.90s -> 8832.89s]  one or two more sandwiches. What was the point of the grenades? I don't even know why. I don't
[8832.89s -> 8864.68s]  even need to dagger. Okay. I think I can do this. All right. So now, um, is this stupid what I'm
[8864.68s -> 8963.46s]  doing? Oh, look at that. Where am I? Put that down. I need to stop this from moving. Can I? Oh,
[8963.46s -> 8977.48s]  look at that. All right. Cool. I didn't know you could do that. Uh, okay. That's the way it goes
[8977.48s -> 8996.58s]  all the way. I have to stop it when it gets to be right here. Like right now. Is that good enough?
[8996.58s -> 9028.26s]  Is it draining the water? It is. Okay. Well, I didn't think it was going to drain the water.
[9028.26s -> 9032.09s]  It's draining the water. I didn't. Okay. I didn't think it was going to drain the water.
[9036.81s -> 9055.90s]  We had a frame drop. Whoa, we did. Holy shit. Why? That was weird. But that was a bad one. There we
[9055.90s -> 9080.55s]  go. I'm going to try. Okay. Now that being said, what do I do with this? I mean, what is this shit
[9080.55s -> 9109.21s]  all over there? This is, um, junk right here. What are you trying to communicate? Octopus arm? What
[9109.21s -> 9134.74s]  are you communicating here? Maybe I should just keep going. What are you communicating? An octopus
[9134.74s -> 9178.47s]  arm. Octopus arm slug. L omega lull octopus arm face. Octopus arm fish. Wait a minute.
[9178.47s -> 9192.52s]  Is that what you mean when you go in like this? That's not what you meant? Oh, it is? But how come
[9192.52s -> 9294.26s]  it didn't work? Oh shit. I did it. I didn't do it. Okay. I get it now though. I understand.
[9347.70s -> 9410.02s]  Ancient. Oh, ancient core. I'm all right. Shit's upside down.
[9462.54s -> 9473.93s]  Can I make it go faster? How do I make it go the other way? Can I, can it turn the other way?
[9473.93s -> 9538.92s]  Go the other way. How do I make it go the other way? Why is everybody going like this? All right.
[9538.92s -> 9605.82s]  This is open. I'll be able to see it. Wait, wait, stop, stop, stop. I'm not ready. I want to just
[9605.82s -> 9624.92s]  shoot water down this way. Hold on. Um, wait, shoot. How do I make it go further? Can I make,
[9624.92s -> 9649.86s]  can I, how do I do this? I think maybe I can block it with the ice. What is this? What does
[9649.86s -> 9710.39s]  that mean? What's this? Oh, I get it. I get it. Nice. Okay. Now I see what that is. That was pretty
[9710.39s -> 9772.02s]  cool. How do I get up? I guess now I can ride it that way. Ooh. Twinkie. We're good. Right. Okay.
[9777.98s -> 9793.37s]  Another shortcut shortcut back down. Cool. Very nice. Well, I got to check over here.
[9818.42s -> 9825.94s]  Um, well, okay. Is that a secret or anything? Chest or something? I could have thought there
[9825.94s -> 9867.74s]  would be a chest or something. Oh well. I got the shortcut. I'm fine. Here we go. Nice halberd.
[9867.74s -> 9904.39s]  Very good. I'll equip that right now. No, let's use the regular guardian spear. All right. All
[9904.39s -> 9920.39s]  right. So that's gone. What does that really do for me though? I think I need to keep it moving.
[9920.39s -> 9951.58s]  Can I just climb this? Never be that easy with it. Maybe. Hold on. Somebody made a gift of you
[9951.58s -> 9967.93s]  farting out the front door. No, it's not. All right. This is just, I can see this in my peripheral.
[9967.93s -> 10002.10s]  I just got to go. Can I swim up that first try? No, you can't see the fire. Okay. This fire. I
[10002.10s -> 10026.94s]  got to probably put the fire out, but how do I do that? Hold on. What if I go put it all the way
[10026.94s -> 10068.25s]  down? Because now can I stand on that? Excuse me. What the fuck are you doing here? Okay. 10 fire
[10068.25s -> 10138.90s]  arrows. Nice. Shit. No, wrong way. What the fuck is this? Wait, where am I? Oh, okay. It was right
[10138.90s -> 10325.30s]  underneath. Okay. I screwed up. Whoa. Okay. Very cool. Ancient shaft. I think I got it. Where is
[10325.30s -> 10497.69s]  this fucking thing? Whoa. What is that? All right. Where, where's, how do I get up here?
[10523.06s -> 10594.38s]  But how do I? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know what yeah means. Can I make it from here?
[10594.38s -> 10616.04s]  I made it. I made it. I'm on top. I'm on top. All right. Now what? Now what?
[10626.26s -> 10653.34s]  Fine. Let's go. I got it. There it is. Oh yeah. Hey, remember the person that said C in five hours?
[10653.34s -> 10674.90s]  It was actually one hour. Sorry. So this last one is in his head. The real question is,
[10675.62s -> 10691.86s]  how do I get in there? It's right in the center of his head. Do I just drop straight down? I'm
[10691.86s -> 10696.07s]  kind of afraid to go anywhere. Straight down right there. I think that's what I need to do.
[10696.63s -> 10729.10s]  And I think that's it. This is definitely it. This is it. All right. Got it. Okay. I just spin
[10729.10s -> 10761.56s]  this. All right. I mean, that's pretty self-explanatory. Missed it, but that's
[10761.56s -> 10817.10s]  all right. The water. I did it. Let them out. They can be free. That was really cool. That really
[10817.10s -> 10856.68s]  was just sort of a super shrine. I should probably heal. The music does not sound like I just won
[10856.68s -> 10869.98s]  maybe defense food or something. I think I'm going to do defense food. Sounds good. High level
[10869.98s -> 10878.22s]  defense food or low level defense food. Well, let's just see what it is first. I'm going to
[10878.22s -> 10903.64s]  heal with just regular ass food. This is plus five hearts. I'm doing this. All right. Whatever
[10903.64s -> 10910.57s]  this is, it's time to fight it. So I'm going to use my guardian sword and I'm going to use this
[10910.57s -> 10915.91s]  cool shield. Let's get rid of one of these. All right. Let's do it. Let's go. All right.
[10915.91s -> 10964.79s]  Fuck you. Whatever you are. Fuck you. You fucking bloomin' onion. Let's go. Oh, God. Water Blight
[10964.79s -> 10992.42s]  Ganon. I thought that was Water Blight Ganon talking. All right. Leave me a voicemail because
[10993.62s -> 11026.22s]  I'm going to be busy here in a sec. Electricity. Electricity. I didn't jump over it. Oh, shit.
[11026.22s -> 11093.46s]  Where'd he go? Whoa. Oh, my God. Can you even dodge that? Why are you taking a picture of me?
[11093.46s -> 11102.02s]  What? Oh, take a picture. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's a terrible photo of that. I mean,
[11102.02s -> 11125.42s]  that's kind of cool though. Try to keep the water. No. Yes. That's still counted, right?
[11125.42s -> 11146.14s]  In a mod chat. Help me here. I think I got a picture of it. I think I'm fine.
[11150.17s -> 11165.53s]  I got a photo. I got a photo already. Get up. He's supposed to torch the water.
[11171.64s -> 11204.57s]  Link, stop being such a slug. Get up. I already took a picture. Wait. They're doing it because
[11204.57s -> 11238.41s]  the frame lag. What? Stop talking. Fucking backseat Andy over here. My bow is broken.
[11238.97s -> 11280.81s]  Oh, no. Give me a bow. Take this calamity again. Yeah, I am dropping frames. You're right.
[11284.02s -> 11287.14s]  I thought you were saying take a picture. I thought I got the photo wrong.
[11292.71s -> 11300.70s]  Pretty good cleric beast. I thought it was like, hey, dude, what the fuck? You take a picture.
[11300.70s -> 11312.01s]  Take a picture. Just dropping a shitload of frames. They were doing. Yeah, I see. Okay.
[11314.44s -> 11325.70s]  What a bad time for frames to drop. It was horrible. Well, I beat the boss.
[11326.34s -> 11335.13s]  Hold on. PowerPoint. Let me just see what this looks like. What was the viewer experience?
[11343.72s -> 11359.82s]  Oh my god. Can you even dodge that? Okay. Well, that's unfortunate, but whatever.
[11366.28s -> 11388.89s]  Very cool. All right. So now what? I'll take my heart container. That was really fun. Wait,
[11388.89s -> 11399.21s]  once you activate, you cannot go back in. So I didn't miss anything important, right? I think
[11399.21s -> 11410.39s]  I got pretty much everything important, I think, right? You're good. All right, let's go. So that's
[11410.39s -> 11423.29s]  one of four. This is probably the easier of the four bosses. It doesn't have to be, you know,
[11423.29s -> 11433.00s]  it doesn't have to be incredibly difficult to be fun. I think it was fun. It was perfect.
[11440.63s -> 11443.70s]  Just in case you didn't know who that was.
[11444.18s -> 11453.66s]  Since I am now a spirit, my healing power would be wasted on me.
[11453.66s -> 11466.06s]  So therefore, I would like you to have it. Please accept Mipha's grace.
[11470.50s -> 11486.78s]  What does that do? Yesterday, I was awash in a pool of tears. I had nearly given up hope
[11486.78s -> 11495.00s]  and resigned myself to being trapped here as a spirit for the rest of eternity. But now you're
[11495.08s -> 11503.53s]  here. All this time, my hope was to see you once more. Promise me that you will not hesitate to
[11503.53s -> 11511.03s]  call upon my power if you ever find yourself in need. A summon? Knowing that will let my spirit
[11511.03s -> 11523.27s]  rest in peace. I must go. Ruta and I have our roles to fulfill. We are both honored to be able
[11523.27s -> 11531.30s]  to play the role of support. We'll annihilate Ganon together. Farewell. See ya.
[11542.76s -> 11546.44s]  Oh, that's cool. It's an instant revive on cooldown. That's really cool.
[11547.00s -> 11565.43s]  I feel like I could probably use that. So this thing is now back under our control.
[11566.31s -> 11629.77s]  Friendly elephant. Oh, you think Calamity Ganon is looking out the window right now?
[11630.41s -> 11633.27s]  Oh, no, fuck.
[11673.02s -> 11674.94s]  Ganon's gonna be in the tower and just be looking out.
[11675.34s -> 11678.28s]  Then we can restore peace to Hyrule.
[11678.28s -> 11682.52s]  You'll never get another three. You need four. You'll never get three more.
[11699.54s -> 11700.74s]  That's a cool looking tower.
[11715.03s -> 11726.46s]  Dude, you need to shut up. This is an emotional scene. You don't care at all.
[11728.22s -> 11738.50s]  What are you talking about? Yeah, I do. Cool. Oh, that's so awesome.
[11738.50s -> 11992.38s]  I was hard to hold that because he's doing the doggy paddle.
[11995.03s -> 12012.47s]  What is this? All right, hold on. Okay, that's it.
[12012.47s -> 12017.75s]  And that's also going to be the end of the stream.
[12017.75s -> 12025.05s]  I think that's a good place to stop right after that.
[12028.31s -> 12047.40s]  No, what do you mean? Oh, I'm sorry. No, you can't. No. Finish. At least,
[12047.40s -> 12051.78s]  okay, I'll at least finish the quest. That makes sense.
[12051.78s -> 12058.79s]  Honestly, the reason why I had to stop doing that stupid routine
[12058.79s -> 12060.97s]  is I actually had no fucking idea where I was going.
[12061.29s -> 12064.09s]  Like, okay, I can't see on the map and I'm not going to go back to the...
[12064.73s -> 12071.64s]  How would you even know where you were going?
[12071.64s -> 12077.83s]  All right, I'll finish this quest and then I'm going to call it.
[12077.83s -> 12081.19s]  And then I'll be live again. What's today? Sunday?
[12081.83s -> 12086.17s]  How's Wednesday look? I think Wednesday is good.
[12093.32s -> 12095.00s]  Same time around three o'clock Pacific.
[12103.16s -> 12108.04s]  All right, get back up here. Finish the quest. Get my shit in here.
[12108.04s -> 12109.88s]  All right, before I'm going to get it. It's another cut scene.
[12109.88s -> 12114.12s]  Whatever. It's cool. 3 p.m. Pacific. Yep. On Wednesday.
[12117.32s -> 12118.44s]  Thanks for watching, though. Appreciate it.
[12127.46s -> 12130.52s]  Same game. Now, that is a good question.
[12132.02s -> 12137.77s]  I'm going to ask everybody here. Do you want...
[12138.41s -> 12144.38s]  Let's get a poll. Do you want more Breath of the Wild on Wednesday?
[12145.02s -> 12152.89s]  I'm going to need a very large amount of people saying yes.
[12162.86s -> 12163.90s]  Saved Zora's Domain.
[12171.26s -> 12173.50s]  Link sincerely apologized for my harsh treatment of you.
[12174.30s -> 12177.90s]  You were thinking Hyrule's and Lady Mipha's well-being just like the rest of us.
[12181.96s -> 12183.64s]  Something else. All right, you know what?
[12183.64s -> 12186.68s]  I mean, this is a 90% again, which is shocking.
[12187.32s -> 12193.99s]  It seems like you don't like the game. What?
[12196.46s -> 12198.54s]  I'm telling you right now, the amount...
[12198.54s -> 12201.42s]  Okay, the percentage that is voting yes right now
[12201.42s -> 12203.82s]  is at least what I feel about this game for a score.
[12206.95s -> 12209.11s]  At the very least. I think this is great.
[12210.60s -> 12211.40s]  I'm having a great time.
[12215.99s -> 12218.15s]  I just want to make sure you guys are having a good time still.
[12219.77s -> 12224.25s]  I'm usually three stream Andy with a game besides Elden Ring.
[12228.14s -> 12229.90s]  If you're still liking it, I'm still liking it.
[12229.90s -> 12230.94s]  Let's keep doing it.
[12230.94s -> 12233.18s]  Maybe I'll play some Splatoon on Wednesday.
[12234.50s -> 12235.38s]  That sounds good, right?
[12240.79s -> 12242.07s]  Maybe open up with some Splatoon.
[12242.07s -> 12243.75s]  Mess around for like an hour or two.
[12243.75s -> 12245.26s]  Jump back into Breath of the Wild.
[12249.58s -> 12250.70s]  Yeah, we'll do that.
[12250.70s -> 12257.26s]  The switch is hooked up.
[12257.26s -> 12258.22s]  It's ready.
[12258.22s -> 12259.10s]  It's being captured.
[12261.51s -> 12263.91s]  Okay, so there's a cool chest over here.
[12265.38s -> 12268.02s]  By the way, Link, I see you are without your trusty blade.
[12268.02s -> 12269.70s]  The sword that seals the darkness.
[12270.78s -> 12272.78s]  Did you perhaps lose it when you lost your memory?
[12274.17s -> 12274.67s]  Maybe.
[12278.78s -> 12280.70s]  Yeah, so we'll do Splatoon 3.
[12281.42s -> 12283.50s]  And Breath of the Wild again on Wednesday.
[12283.50s -> 12291.15s]  Okay.
[12291.53s -> 12302.09s]  As your father, I am proud of you for fighting the Divine Beast alongside Link.
[12302.09s -> 12304.68s]  You've grown much recently.
[12305.24s -> 12307.56s]  I know you'll be a worthy heir when your time comes.
[12308.20s -> 12310.25s]  Mother, thank you.
[12310.89s -> 12314.39s]  The heavy rains have stopped and the Divine Beast is our ally once again.
[12316.49s -> 12317.45s]  Truly splendid.
[12318.41s -> 12319.13s]  This is wonderful.
[12319.13s -> 12319.63s]  Cool.
[12320.09s -> 12321.14s]  All right, what's on the chest?
[12332.12s -> 12334.44s]  Top tier expression of gratitude.
[12334.44s -> 12340.36s]  All right, we're gonna have a party?
[12352.46s -> 12356.71s]  All right, so what is in the chest?
[12357.43s -> 12364.55s]  Light scale trident.
[12372.26s -> 12372.90s]  Cool.
[12372.90s -> 12376.01s]  Does this do anything cool?
[12378.63s -> 12379.67s]  This can be repaired.
[12379.67s -> 12381.35s]  It's a unique weapon and can repair.
[12384.54s -> 12385.42s]  Save this weapon.
[12385.42s -> 12386.62s]  Do not use it.
[12386.62s -> 12387.18s]  Okay.
[12387.18s -> 12390.70s]  I mean, I wasn't planning on it.
[12390.70s -> 12395.30s]  All these ones like this 60, this plus plus plus plus.
[12395.30s -> 12396.74s]  I'm gonna hoard so many of these items.
[12399.11s -> 12399.99s]  I'll use the default.
[12402.26s -> 12403.14s]  Okay, cool.
[12403.14s -> 12403.94s]  All right, guys.
[12403.94s -> 12405.22s]  I'll see you on Wednesday.
[12405.22s -> 12411.70s]  Thanks for watching.
[12411.70s -> 12412.66s]  Have a good rest of your night.
[12414.55s -> 12415.67s]  I'm gonna save it right here.
[12415.91s -> 12429.00s]  This is exactly where we're gonna open back up.
[12429.00s -> 12430.36s]  What about the photo?
[12430.36s -> 12431.96s]  We'll do that right when I get up.
[12431.96s -> 12434.20s]  When I start again on Wednesday.
[12434.20s -> 12450.07s]  It looks like all the last part of the Stream of Conscious Charity is going on still.
[12450.07s -> 12452.31s]  Yeah, I'll send you guys there.
[12452.31s -> 12453.51s]  Sent you there last night, too.
[12453.51s -> 12456.57s]  I think it's Vinny's doing something right.
[12456.57s -> 12460.84s]  Go say hello.
[12460.84s -> 12465.29s]  Go support the charity stream, obviously.
[12465.29s -> 12467.45s]  And I'll talk to you guys later.
[12467.45s -> 12468.09s]  See you Wednesday.
[12468.09s -> 12468.81s]  Take care of yourselves.
[12468.81s -> 12469.29s]  Good night.
[12469.29s -> 12469.93s]  Goodbye.
[12469.93s -> 12471.78s]  Say what?
[12471.78s -> 12490.66s]  I almost forgot.
[12490.66s -> 12491.46s]  Yeah, call your mother.
[12491.46s -> 12491.96s]  Come on.
