[1.34s -> 11.09s]  Ugh, I'm not gonna lie. This coffee tastes like somebody flouted in my face.
[13.10s -> 26.72s]  I'm currently trying to get this guy to punch this lady in the face accidentally. He's trying to punch me in the face.
[26.72s -> 30.52s]  I'm trying to get him to hit this old lady, and he's going to eventually.
[30.52s -> 42.48s]  Oh, the germa laugh.
[42.48s -> 44.48s]  Come on, do it again. Do it again.
[44.48s -> 47.43s]  Knock the lady out again.
[47.43s -> 51.43s]  Hold on, this cop, this cop is shooting him.
[51.43s -> 61.54s]  I'm moving in.
[61.54s -> 66.45s]  There's the guy.
[66.45s -> 71.17s]  I'll see you later.
[71.17s -> 75.52s]  How did he get up here?
[75.52s -> 77.52s]  Here come more people.
[77.52s -> 86.72s]  Oh, there's stairs.
[86.72s -> 88.72s]  Here comes another one.
[88.72s -> 91.16s]  Come on, come on down.
[91.16s -> 96.58s]  You can make it.
[102.00s -> 104.56s]  Did you think you were gonna make that?
[104.56s -> 106.56s]  Suspect down there.
[106.56s -> 108.56s]  Don't worry, I'm going in boys.
[108.56s -> 112.56s]  Cover me. It's only like a 200 foot drop.
[119.64s -> 123.86s]  Where was it?
[123.86s -> 128.15s]  Come down here.
[128.15s -> 131.54s]  No, no, please. I don't want to get in here.
[131.54s -> 133.54s]  No, shoot like the fence down for me or something useful.
[133.54s -> 135.84s]  What the heck?
[135.84s -> 147.24s]  I'm gonna wait.
[147.24s -> 153.30s]  Again.
[153.30s -> 156.88s]  What was he accomplishing by doing that?
[156.88s -> 160.88s]  You called that guy to help protect you.
[160.88s -> 164.88s]  That guy just gave his life to save yours.
[164.88s -> 166.88s]  What happened?
[166.88s -> 168.88s]  You better be grateful.
[168.88s -> 171.51s]  I was still clueless.
[171.51s -> 176.64s]  Okay, let the headache pass for a second.
[176.64s -> 179.78s]  Okay, I was...
[179.78s -> 187.01s]  Oh my god, there's a whole bunch of...
[187.01s -> 189.01s]  Oh my god, here they come.
[189.01s -> 192.98s]  Oh my god, that's terrifying.
[192.98s -> 195.92s]  This is the scariest thing ever.
[195.92s -> 197.92s]  Let's go, let's go.
[197.92s -> 199.92s]  Where are they shooting at?
[199.92s -> 201.92s]  Are they shooting at me or you?
[201.92s -> 203.92s]  They're shooting at me probably.
[203.92s -> 205.92s]  Why are my bodyguards not helping me?
[205.92s -> 212.12s]  Oh, here we go.
[212.12s -> 215.19s]  They're probably shooting at me.
[215.19s -> 217.19s]  What are they doing?
[217.19s -> 219.88s]  Why are your bodyguards going crazy?
[219.88s -> 221.88s]  No, seriously, leave me alone.
[221.88s -> 224.12s]  Are they chasing me?
[224.12s -> 226.12s]  Jerma, you better run.
[226.12s -> 228.12s]  Because I'm coming for you.
[228.12s -> 230.36s]  No, I was on your side.
[230.36s -> 234.82s]  I can't go that way either.
[234.82s -> 236.82s]  I cannot go either way.
[236.82s -> 241.43s]  You guys are chasing me down.
[241.43s -> 243.43s]  I think they stopped.
[243.43s -> 245.43s]  No, they didn't, they're sprinting.
[245.43s -> 247.43s]  They stopped, Jerma.
[247.43s -> 249.67s]  There better be.
[249.67s -> 254.92s]  I don't trust the one in the back that's crouching.
[254.92s -> 256.92s]  Take a screenshot.
[256.92s -> 262.29s]  We're going to use this for my album cover.
[262.29s -> 264.79s]  This guy back here, I don't trust him.
[264.79s -> 267.22s]  The one that's sitting back here.
[267.22s -> 269.22s]  I don't see one.
[269.22s -> 271.22s]  He's crouched, he's permanently crouched.
[271.22s -> 273.40s]  One just fell.
[273.40s -> 276.92s]  Let's go.
[276.92s -> 279.16s]  I want to go make sure all these guys are dead.
[279.16s -> 281.16s]  We can't have any more Unsullied on the streets.
[288.04s -> 294.37s]  Get in, quick.
[294.37s -> 296.37s]  This is too much.
[296.37s -> 299.64s]  This is too much.
[299.64s -> 301.64s]  You went too fast, too quick.
[324.72s -> 326.96s]  I'm going to die.
[326.96s -> 329.46s]  I'm going to die.
[329.46s -> 331.46s]  I'm going to die.
[335.76s -> 337.76s]  You were just dragging around a magnet.
[343.72s -> 345.72s]  Hello bus driver.
[345.72s -> 347.72s]  How are you?
[347.72s -> 349.72s]  It's 7th and 24th street, please.
[349.72s -> 351.72s]  I would appreciate it if you were on the double, by the way.
[354.66s -> 356.66s]  I have a kid's birthday party I'm going to.
[356.66s -> 358.66s]  Thank you.
[358.66s -> 360.66s]  This looks good right here.
[360.66s -> 362.66s]  I think I'm going to get out right at this moment.
[372.07s -> 374.07s]  The second your character stepped out of the bus,
[374.07s -> 376.31s]  it was all a hell.
[376.31s -> 378.31s]  Everything was controlled until that moment.
[378.31s -> 384.20s]  Like the very tip?
[384.20s -> 386.20s]  Yes. Enjoy.
[386.20s -> 392.52s]  I'm going to be fine.
[392.52s -> 394.52s]  I'm going to land right in the water and be completely fine.
[394.52s -> 397.52s]  Wow, that was amazing.
[397.52s -> 399.52s]  You have to do that again.
[399.52s -> 402.28s]  That was unbelievable.
[402.28s -> 405.80s]  Hey, this is a good boat view.
[405.80s -> 407.80s]  Look at the birds up there.
[407.80s -> 414.84s]  I'm in the boat holder.
[414.84s -> 416.84s]  It's the perfect size to be a boat holder.
[418.84s -> 421.52s]  Let's put this up on the shelf, Ma.
[421.52s -> 423.96s]  I'm in the boat holder.
[423.96s -> 425.96s]  I'm in the boat holder.
[425.96s -> 427.96s]  I'm going to take my boat out today, guys.
[440.31s -> 442.31s]  This guy's a fat fuck.
[444.31s -> 446.31s]  Is that the funniest thing you've ever seen?
[446.31s -> 448.31s]  I've never seen a guy in GTA that was this gross.
