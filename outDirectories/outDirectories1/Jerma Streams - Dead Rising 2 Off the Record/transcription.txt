[1.08s -> 8.54s]  Oh hi guys. Do you want to see... I'm a little irritated.
[8.54s -> 11.98s]  You want to see something that I cannot believe.
[11.98s -> 16.22s]  I'm trying to figure out how this is even possible.
[16.22s -> 19.42s]  First of all, sorry I'm a little bit late. I had some controller input issues
[19.42s -> 23.02s]  because Dead Rising 2 does not actually have native
[23.02s -> 26.70s]  controller support built into the PC version. So I had to
[26.70s -> 29.82s]  get an emulator for that and wow what a pain in the ass. But
[29.82s -> 34.95s]  even worse than that. Somehow. Just skip the intro.
[34.95s -> 43.85s]  Give me a scenario, any scenario, where at the at the menu screen having
[43.85s -> 50.17s]  art gallery, downloadable content, and import games for windows live is
[50.17s -> 57.91s]  more important than the options menu. You gotta go
[57.91s -> 65.43s]  into the fucking game, into the actual video game to change settings.
[65.43s -> 71.16s]  Why is this here? Imagine getting this shown.
[71.16s -> 76.09s]  You're a boss, you're the boss, okay? You're the boss of a video game company.
[76.09s -> 79.78s]  You make video games and this is what you're presented for the
[79.78s -> 89.98s]  the the menu for the game? I'd be like go back and redo this whole fucking thing.
[89.98s -> 93.82s]  This is like advertisements.
[93.82s -> 98.97s]  Give me the options menu so I can like check to see if my controller works.
[98.97s -> 105.34s]  Can we change the graphic settings? What?
[105.34s -> 109.58s]  Yeah import games for windows live. That's more important.
[109.58s -> 115.62s]  I'm surprised there's a goddamn quit button here. Anyways how you doing?
[115.62s -> 123.66s]  The game's 10 years old. The first one had it.
[123.66s -> 129.78s]  The first game had this. Every game has this. It's not just 10 years.
[129.78s -> 132.90s]  Every fucking video game. Every video game has an
[132.90s -> 141.77s]  options menu before you start the video game.
[141.77s -> 145.77s]  Downloadable content? That's got to be hidden in the options menu.
[145.77s -> 153.72s]  Put these in the options menu. Would you run out of time?
[153.72s -> 157.40s]  Anyways hi guys we're gonna play Dead Rising 2 off the record today.
[157.40s -> 161.80s]  Why am I not playing the original game? Well we had a
[161.80s -> 167.53s]  a lot of deliberation in the chat room and hold on you can't even hear this.
[167.53s -> 172.38s]  We had a lot of deliberation in the chat room about which one
[172.38s -> 176.44s]  I should play because I thought they were different games but they're not.
[176.44s -> 181.29s]  There was a lot of fighting. You have no idea. I'm sitting here trying to set up
[181.29s -> 184.65s]  my controller, emulate my goddamn xbox one controller.
[184.65s -> 190.52s]  I look over here and there's a fight. Like a brawl in the chat about
[190.52s -> 193.96s]  which version of the game should I play and it was just like
[193.96s -> 199.27s]  people would throw and shit tables are flipped over.
[199.27s -> 203.19s]  But it came to my realization that they are in fact the same
[203.19s -> 207.69s]  video game told from different perspectives. The bosses and the
[207.69s -> 211.51s]  items, everything's the same. This one has some extra content is what
[211.51s -> 218.10s]  I've been told. By like 70% of the people in the chat.
[218.10s -> 232.68s]  This is not true. Literally not true. This one's not canon though.
[232.68s -> 238.49s]  This is a DLC. No it's not. No it's not because I
[238.49s -> 243.77s]  listen to me. I downloaded Dead Rising 2. This is a separate purchase on Steam.
[243.77s -> 248.82s]  It's a separate video game. I made that mistake.
[248.82s -> 253.70s]  This is not a DLC for Dead Rising 2. This is a full standalone video game.
[253.70s -> 266.23s]  Dead Rising 2 again. He bought the wrong one. No this is the
[266.23s -> 269.19s]  right one because I want to use the camera too and we're playing with Frank.
[269.19s -> 287.99s]  Still no options menu by the way. This is Dead Rising 2 too.
[287.99s -> 292.68s]  So what I could do, I was thinking about doing both anyways.
[292.68s -> 301.11s]  Going back and playing as Chuck. This is why like constant conflict in
[301.11s -> 304.87s]  this chat. I may as well open up a Barbie game after
[304.87s -> 311.78s]  talking about all this. Do a poll. I did three of them before
[311.78s -> 315.94s]  the stream started. Unanimously it was this game. We're going.
[315.94s -> 324.60s]  Don't care. Like it was 80 percent. It was like 75 percent.
[324.60s -> 329.77s]  I clawed my way out of Willamette. I fought hard
[329.77s -> 333.21s]  to uncover the truth of what happened at that mall.
[333.21s -> 341.80s]  This is really loud. Turn your speakers down for a few minutes
[341.80s -> 348.39s]  because I can't alt tab. Things were good.
[348.39s -> 361.06s]  Real good. It was an options aisle.
[363.46s -> 368.58s]  Then I let things get to me. I let things
[368.66s -> 374.18s]  get out of control. Dead Rising 2. The original has options.
[374.18s -> 378.90s]  Are you fucking kidding me? How is it possible to have this?
[378.90s -> 384.90s]  I think deep down I knew I hadn't uncovered what was really going on.
[384.90s -> 416.74s]  Fighting never ends. This is a fight. Things got pretty dark. I'm like dad at
[416.74s -> 419.78s]  the dinner table while the whole family argues.
[419.86s -> 425.62s]  To get back at game. I got a huge family. I'm at the very end of the table just
[425.62s -> 429.30s]  slowly cutting my steak and I hear people yelling about their days and
[429.30s -> 432.42s]  screaming at each other about what's better and I'm just like god damn it.
[432.42s -> 436.42s]  How do I keep this fucking family together? I just take a bite.
[436.42s -> 470.46s]  Excuse me sir. What is it kid? I signed your waiver.
[470.46s -> 473.98s]  You got my next of kin. Are the vultures circling already?
[473.98s -> 479.26s]  Everybody settle down. Yeah sorry sir. It's just paperwork.
[479.26s -> 482.86s]  They want it from everyone. Oh I've lost control. Would you mind if I got your
[482.86s -> 492.04s]  autograph? This spoils too but this this is too.
[492.04s -> 495.32s]  Isn't it? It's isn't the same game. Sorry about that.
[495.32s -> 498.98s]  What's going on? Everybody sit up. It's been a while.
[498.98s -> 502.58s]  Eat your peas Jeffrey. You've always been a big hero. You never eat your peas.
[502.58s -> 507.51s]  I was really bummed when your show went off the air.
[507.51s -> 512.41s]  Wow thanks. So I guess this would be worth quite a bit if anything happened
[512.41s -> 520.10s]  to you out there tonight. Uh yeah I guess so. Good luck out there.
[520.10s -> 528.95s]  Maybe this wasn't such a bad idea after all.
[528.95s -> 538.76s]  TK has a very special surprise for you. He is the original zombie killer himself.
[538.76s -> 544.84s]  No I'm not. I'm the DLC killer. The one, the only,
[544.88s -> 547.88s]  Frank Weiss.
[551.37s -> 560.02s]  So Fortune City. Now for a show. I know it's really loud but I
[560.02s -> 563.70s]  don't have access. Showing options. That's an awesome
[563.70s -> 567.30s]  scepter microphone. That scepter microphone is
[567.30s -> 572.26s]  unbelievable. Bigger than payoffs. Especially if you use those corner
[572.26s -> 577.46s]  grinders. I do like a good grinding.
[577.46s -> 584.18s]  But first TK has got a personal message just for you Frank Weiss.
[584.18s -> 588.42s]  You gotta be willing to risk it all if you're ever
[588.42s -> 606.17s]  really gonna win. That's so loud. Okay. Hi guys.
[606.17s -> 613.61s]  Okay kill zombies win money. You got it. Stop. Stop. Oh.
[613.61s -> 617.46s]  Would have been really nice if this was available.
[617.46s -> 638.89s]  Fuck a DLC game. Can you guys hear me? God I'm back. Subtitles it's fine.
[638.89s -> 651.26s]  Uh nope. PC settings. That's all right. Controller. Yes.
[651.26s -> 659.00s]  Blur effects. No. High. High. Forex. Save those changes.
[659.00s -> 663.58s]  Keep these changes. Yes. It's at 60 hertz right now.
[663.58s -> 672.33s]  Oh give me a break. Why did it? Visual. PC settings. Uh oh.
[672.33s -> 675.29s]  If this crashes. If this crashes the game I'm gonna put a halt from my
[675.29s -> 693.06s]  monitor and I'm ending the stream. Okay we're good. All right you ready?
[693.06s -> 709.94s]  Let's go. Why am I not playing two? Because there was a huge fight at the
[709.94s -> 714.18s]  dinner table before the stream started. And like 70% of the people told me to
[714.18s -> 716.90s]  play this one. Clip that and and
[716.90s -> 719.94s]  clip that fucking thing I just said.
[720.02s -> 753.94s]  And if anybody asks. Oh shit. They were wrong. I don't know man.
[753.94s -> 758.74s]  I haven't played these games before. I thought I was under the impression that
[758.74s -> 762.18s]  this was they like redid two and made it with another character and added
[762.18s -> 765.22s]  features. This is two again but it's not the same. Everybody hates Chuck.
[765.22s -> 768.34s]  Nobody likes Chuck. I don't even know who that is. They just don't like that
[768.34s -> 783.26s]  person. Jump on the corner. Oops I wasn't looking.
[783.26s -> 797.24s]  All right I'm gonna get as many people up here as I can. Go!
[797.24s -> 803.13s]  Grind him up. Oh the fire comes out. Right.
[803.13s -> 816.33s]  Almost at 15. Look I'll like speedrun the fucking first game okay?
[816.33s -> 851.50s]  No jump off. Dammit. 25,000. Why is he not freaking going up?
[851.50s -> 872.89s]  3,000. 4,000. 5,000. 25,000. They have to be in the ring?
[872.89s -> 874.81s]  They gotta be in the ring. Gotta be in the ring. Gotta be in the ring. Somebody
[874.81s -> 887.19s]  get in the ring. No!
[924.30s -> 931.54s]  I'm so I said every cutscene is fucking pre-rendered and pre-loaded and you
[931.54s -> 936.09s]  can't do anything about it. Use volume mixer and windows. Well I
[936.09s -> 940.01s]  have to that I have to I have to alt tap and the game fucking breaks if you alt
[940.01s -> 943.61s]  tab. Video games suck okay? Can we just be
[943.61s -> 956.55s]  very clear? These things are being held together with
[956.55s -> 962.25s]  like Elmer's glue especially on PC like 10 years ago.
[962.25s -> 1006.09s]  Is that Chuck? I can't believe I just did that. I feel like such a sellout.
[1006.09s -> 1011.16s]  Hey do you know how I can get the hell out of here? Yeah take the elevator up a
[1011.16s -> 1012.84s]  floor and then straight down the hallway.
[1012.84s -> 1019.10s]  You can't miss it. All right now imagine my shock
[1019.10s -> 1024.49s]  when I put a poll in chat that has three or four hundred votes on it
[1024.49s -> 1028.17s]  and 70 percent of those people say this is the one you should play.
[1028.17s -> 1031.69s]  Now imagine my shock when I turn the stream on and in comes the flood of
[1031.69s -> 1035.42s]  people that say that it was completely wrong.
[1035.42s -> 1042.84s]  It was like 70 percent. What about the other three thousand votes?
[1042.84s -> 1067.18s]  Imagine my fucking shock. I did a poll three times.
[1067.18s -> 1070.78s]  It's over. Well I just this is just this is you want to talk about not canon
[1070.78s -> 1092.23s]  stories? Here's a not canon story for you. Here's
[1092.23s -> 1110.95s]  some here's some non-canon for you. The fuck? How could this be different?
[1110.95s -> 1119.98s]  It's the same audience. What? You guys are doing this just just out of
[1119.98s -> 1141.14s]  spite right now. Even still for god damn it. Is he fatter?
[1141.14s -> 1143.86s]  Frank wants to use the guide arrow to find a way to the exit. The guide arrow
[1143.86s -> 1155.69s]  will always point towards Frank's current objective.
[1155.69s -> 1159.13s]  No the mistake I made was playing a game that's more than 10 years old that has
[1159.13s -> 1179.42s]  a lot of fans. That's the biggest mistake of all.
[1179.42s -> 1182.62s]  60 percent. How many of those people did that just to be a dick?
[1182.62s -> 1188.04s]  I wonder. We're doing this. We're doing this because I'm already here and I
[1188.04s -> 1191.48s]  already set up the stupid emulator to use the controller.
[1191.48s -> 1194.98s]  I'm gonna go back you know just to spite everything.
[1194.98s -> 1200.57s]  I'm gonna play through two again as chuck when I'm done with this.
[1200.57s -> 1217.61s]  All right save the game visit a bathroom. You can save as often as
[1217.61s -> 1221.37s]  as you'd like and it's a good idea to do so. Find the closest bathroom by looking
[1221.37s -> 1235.29s]  for the save icon on the map. Okay I just walked away from it. Okay me
[1235.29s -> 1239.93s]  and Frank have the same body. That's I mean at least ass wise. Yes
[1239.93s -> 1242.17s]  I did just say that. You know it's all out the window at this
[1242.17s -> 1288.84s]  point. Who cares? God damn it. All right let's go.
[1288.84s -> 1293.16s]  Non-canon spoilers. I never thought I'd get to do something so important.
[1293.16s -> 1302.39s]  What the hell are you up to TK?
[1302.55s -> 1306.55s]  Frank West is back complete with his photo journalistic skills. Ready the
[1306.55s -> 1308.63s]  camera by holding down left trigger? Yeah.
[1308.63s -> 1312.94s]  And tapping right bumper. Release left trigger to put the camera away.
[1312.94s -> 1317.67s]  Erotica, horror, outtake, drama, and brutality.
[1317.67s -> 1322.22s]  That's from the last one right? Take photos when you see the yellow pp icons.
[1322.22s -> 1327.32s]  They will get you even more pp. Lock in your favorite pictures in the
[1327.32s -> 1331.53s]  picture viewer. Yeah I remember that. New photos automatically overwrite
[1331.53s -> 1340.78s]  unlocked photos. Ready camera by holding
[1340.86s -> 1348.52s]  LT and tapping right bumper. Right.
[1349.90s -> 1364.07s]  Got you. What is that?
[1364.07s -> 1378.87s]  Got it. All right I got what I needed. That's TK and Brandon. Don't look.
[1378.87s -> 1397.27s]  That's a special special. Better angle up here.
[1397.27s -> 1400.07s]  Is that a bomb?
[1419.21s -> 1442.49s]  Dead Rising 2 spoils off the record. Got him. All right this is it. I got the
[1442.49s -> 1452.60s]  briefcase switch. How could they ignore me doing this?
[1452.60s -> 1458.20s]  Not good. I gotta zoom in. Jump down to get a better shot. I don't
[1458.20s -> 1467.27s]  count. I think I can jump down. Got it. You're playing for Super Mario
[1467.31s -> 1473.75s]  2 as Luigi. Oh all right. I'm all right with that.
[1473.75s -> 1492.95s]  Gotta get back to my show. Well looky here. Hey you're a little late for
[1492.95s -> 1497.13s]  the autographs. I was just looking for the men's room.
[1497.13s -> 1506.90s]  Story of my life. No. Dude that is so funny.
[1506.90s -> 1520.70s]  Is it like a dodge roll or something? Third run?
[1520.70s -> 1526.86s]  He just spit on me. I know that technique from the last game.
[1536.79s -> 1547.29s]  This guy's the same size.
[1550.07s -> 1562.47s]  Wait it's scripted. It's scripted. I think you've overstayed your welcome a bit
[1562.47s -> 1575.61s]  Frankie. Call me if you're for a photo shoot.
[1575.61s -> 1588.38s]  Who is that? Chuck is a man of god and doesn't have scenes like this.
[1588.38s -> 1592.52s]  You must have to take pills for that at your age.
[1592.52s -> 1597.24s]  Dude I'm sorry the stream pre-orders had me thinking a completely different
[1597.24s -> 1605.75s]  thing. Well good night ladies.
[1605.75s -> 1629.53s]  This is a sex game. Blood suckers. There's a 45 minute long sex scene.
[1629.53s -> 1639.98s]  Imagine how imagine trying to get that into a game.
[1639.98s -> 1684.18s]  It would never happen. It's unskippable.
[1684.82s -> 1689.99s]  Gotta get one. Horror horror horror horror horror.
[1689.99s -> 1702.86s]  Oh Tom Terry. That was quick. Alice is dead. Well I can't save
[1702.86s -> 1708.65s]  everybody. All right well let's go.
[1708.65s -> 1724.46s]  Anything in here? There's food in here. Not saving anybody. Omega lull. We can't.
[1724.46s -> 1731.78s]  All right fire axe. No keep fire axe. He's so
[1731.78s -> 1746.25s]  red. This actually got a little stupid.
[1746.25s -> 1769.51s]  Why how did it get on my back? Go in here.
[1769.51s -> 1779.83s]  Yep that's pretty good. No what are you doing?
[1779.83s -> 1786.12s]  Hey there handsome. Take off those shoes now.
[1786.12s -> 1790.97s]  This first second I'm able to the shoes are coming off. Anything else in here?
[1790.97s -> 1793.96s]  No let's go.
[1795.64s -> 1812.94s]  Is there this throwing in this game right? Dale.
[1812.94s -> 1818.90s]  Dale's dead. I just triple tapped that guy.
[1818.90s -> 1822.94s]  Is this money on the ground? Wait what is this? Keys?
[1822.94s -> 1836.57s]  Security box? Wait Jeremiah.
[1837.85s -> 1853.80s]  Did he like run his head into a spike? All right I'm coming to think that you
[1853.80s -> 1857.24s]  can't actually do anything. Pat and Lucas.
[1857.24s -> 1863.06s]  They just keep coming. I can't do anything about it.
[1863.06s -> 1872.95s]  Oh fuck.
[1873.75s -> 1876.57s]  It's decent.
[1878.25s -> 1891.29s]  Andrea can I do anything? Why are there grenades everywhere?
[1891.29s -> 1910.92s]  Don't use grenades in close proximity guys. We have five community subs coming
[1910.92s -> 1928.12s]  from Kazoo. One of these is Chuck.
[1928.68s -> 1946.36s]  There's Chuck. All right get in the safe house.
[1946.36s -> 1973.46s]  Chuck. Do I make it into the elevator? We'll find out.
[1973.54s -> 1984.98s]  Sort of jogged right in. Time to break the bank Vegas style.
[1984.98s -> 1996.58s]  By the way this is Vegas. I can't get a signal. Why?
[1996.58s -> 2000.28s]  Why can't I get a signal? It's because you don't have Verizon.
[2000.28s -> 2003.48s]  She was looking right at me and they found her and I couldn't do anything.
[2003.48s -> 2007.56s]  She went down without a sound and I had to get out of there. I just
[2007.56s -> 2033.58s]  ran. He does look like Dan Aykroyd. Whoa whoa.
[2033.58s -> 2041.58s]  Name's Frank. Frank West. Oh you're the big shot from Willamette.
[2041.58s -> 2047.80s]  Yeah. I seen you on tv. I don't take this the wrong way but
[2047.80s -> 2052.97s]  ain't you affected? Hey don't worry.
[2052.97s -> 2058.26s]  It's under control. Zombrex. You better have three days work.
[2058.26s -> 2063.83s]  You seem real nice. I'd hate to have to put a bullet in your head.
[2063.83s -> 2069.21s]  Uh thanks. We ain't got these Zombrex here.
[2069.21s -> 2072.89s]  Military have to quarantine first. They'll enter the city at first light
[2072.89s -> 2079.62s]  three days from now to get all of us. That's the standard procedure. So we're
[2079.62s -> 2082.98s]  stuck here. Where is he keeping that Zombrex?
[2082.98s -> 2087.30s]  Not out there. What you think? Probably down the front of his pants.
[2087.30s -> 2123.77s]  Damn it. I'm already out of coffee. What a disaster.
[2123.77s -> 2130.55s]  Orange juice. I've already seen it. Didn't he just say we don't have any
[2130.55s -> 2139.02s]  Zombrex? I know where you can get some Zombrex.
[2139.02s -> 2144.97s]  Collie Brady thanks for the five subs. Thanks for the five community subs.
[2144.97s -> 2148.82s]  I figured you were infected. Though I don't remember you saying anything about that in your book.
[2148.82s -> 2156.84s]  Well it's not exactly something I'd go around. There's a pharmacy
[2156.84s -> 2161.72s]  in the royal flesh mall. Back to the mall. I'm Stacy Borsig by the way.
[2161.72s -> 2167.16s]  I'm Frank. Frank. Frank West. Plenty of people know you.
[2167.16s -> 2171.98s]  Do you know a way out of here? No but if you find one
[2171.98s -> 2176.30s]  I suggest you take this. That way we can keep in touch.
[2179.82s -> 2184.73s]  There's closed circuit cameras all over the city. These monitors are playback only.
[2184.73s -> 2188.73s]  But I'll keep an eye on them. Bluetooth headset. Those must have just come out
[2188.73s -> 2192.41s]  right? Frank, if you find anyone alive out there.
[2192.41s -> 2206.76s]  I've got experience rounding up survivors. Hello?
[2206.76s -> 2211.40s]  Okay got the map. Find Zombrex. Here we go. You've just reached a checkpoint. These
[2211.40s -> 2214.84s]  occur throughout Fortune City. Whenever you see checkpoint reached you
[2214.84s -> 2221.10s]  have reached a checkpoint. Right. Save often if you quit your current
[2221.10s -> 2228.04s]  game or power off you will lose your checkpoint.
[2228.04s -> 2234.22s]  Okay. The military will arrive in three days to contain the zombie outbreak.
[2234.22s -> 2237.26s]  Of course. Keep track of how much time is left. Press
[2237.26s -> 2242.01s]  the select to check the watch right? Always remember that Frank needs
[2242.01s -> 2248.31s]  Zombrex every 24 hours. Oh shit. The transceiver will let you
[2248.31s -> 2252.68s]  receive co-op calls. Well we're not going to be doing that.
[2252.68s -> 2256.36s]  People can drop in for a co-op game at any time. You can restrict who joins in
[2256.36s -> 2260.54s]  the gameplay options. Explore Fortune City with a friend and
[2260.54s -> 2266.34s]  slaughter even more undead. Me and Star played this like five years
[2266.34s -> 2269.85s]  ago. But we only made it about an hour or two
[2269.85s -> 2279.03s]  into the game I think. All right so uh where are we at?
[2279.03s -> 2283.30s]  I should check out Roy's Mart in Royal Flush Plaza.
[2283.30s -> 2286.90s]  Right. That's the destination I've got until
[2286.90s -> 2292.41s]  uh 8 a.m. You got it. How do I pick up the uh
[2292.41s -> 2296.73s]  how do I put up the watch?
[2299.94s -> 2306.44s]  8 a.m. Eastern time? Sounds like it. All right. Give it this flashlight.
[2306.44s -> 2310.12s]  Just give me like a give me a palette. No. Give me a piece of wood.
[2310.12s -> 2320.82s]  All right. How do I throw? What's the throw object?
[2320.82s -> 2325.61s]  It's not right trigger. Left bumper? Right bumper?
[2325.61s -> 2333.62s]  Right trigger? How do you throw?
[2334.34s -> 2338.70s]  All right. Fuck. Who cares? You can't throw inside the safe room. Okay. Right.
[2338.70s -> 2351.22s]  Right. How many safe slots do I get? I have to be really careful then. I have
[2351.22s -> 2359.80s]  I get three slots. I had like 10 in Dead Rising.
[2359.80s -> 2368.65s]  At least six. Right. I remember being down here and just throwing shit at each
[2368.65s -> 2381.18s]  other. You get 12 slots in original Dead Rising
[2381.18s -> 2384.15s]  too. Sounds like a much better game. You can't
[2384.15s -> 2406.65s]  keep Frank West bottled up. All right. What is it with me and Vince?
[2406.65s -> 2413.29s]  Zombrex. So I need to go to here. So we go straight out. Bang a left.
[2413.29s -> 2420.42s]  Just make our way over there. I guess. I got nothing else to do. So that. Okay.
[2420.42s -> 2426.14s]  There it is. Saw blades. What's in the box?
[2426.14s -> 2434.82s]  Just more saws. Can they stack in this game? No they don't. All right. Let's go.
[2434.82s -> 2438.18s]  Oh there's a shovel though. I'm gonna replace flashlight with. No. Handbag with
[2438.18s -> 2442.10s]  shovel. That's much. Does it have a super punch?
[2442.18s -> 2455.08s]  Yep. How do I bring up the watch? Isn't it? Wasn't it left on the d-pad?
[2455.08s -> 2459.00s]  Stacy will send you messages about the interesting things she sees happening
[2459.00s -> 2462.50s]  around Fortune City. Each mission has a time limit. Right.
[2462.50s -> 2465.54s]  You can track the time limits on the mission queue
[2465.54s -> 2469.94s]  on the HUD or in the watch screen. Right. Messages will lead you to survivors of
[2469.94s -> 2472.50s]  the zombie outbreak scattered around the city. Yes they will.
[2472.50s -> 2484.17s]  And that's urgent. Frank. I flush Plaza. Royce Mart is on the other side of the mall.
[2484.25s -> 2493.11s]  Blast. Things that I don't say on a. There's slot machines in this game.
[2493.11s -> 2496.23s]  Welcome to Fortune City where money is king. People come to Fortune City to win
[2496.23s -> 2498.39s]  big. You'll never know when you'll need some
[2498.39s -> 2501.82s]  money. Smashing ATMs and slot machines can earn

[2514.18s -> 2520.62s]  box keys. They can lead you to big cash rewards if you see one. Grab it.
[2520.62s -> 2526.52s]  So there's money in this game. Okay. What's that? I have like two of these.
[2526.52s -> 2537.75s]  Okay. Can I see how many of these I have? All right. Let's do it. Shoes. Off.
[2537.75s -> 2545.83s]  In closet. My favorite place to be. All right. We'll just let a brick. This is
[2545.83s -> 2561.02s]  bricks in this game. I want a brick. You can throw bricks? Yeah.
[2561.02s -> 2569.08s]  I think I've had the same reaction. What a pathetic throw. He threw that
[2569.16s -> 2578.02s]  like it weighed 10 times more than it does.
[2578.74s -> 2589.11s]  I have to hit somebody in the face with this. Got it. Okay. I can move on.
[2589.11s -> 2596.04s]  What else is in here? Vinyl records. Large soda.
[2596.04s -> 2599.72s]  Register. Smash the register.
[2605.78s -> 2619.48s]  Wow. You actually do collect money. Gun. Get the foam finger. Red spray paint.
[2619.48s -> 2624.41s]  I need a big game. Okay. I gotta go. How do guns work in this game?
[2624.41s -> 2629.51s]  Are they just as horrible? They're pretty good. They're not bad.
[2629.51s -> 2642.46s]  All right. Let's go find. Let's just do this because I'm here.
[2642.46s -> 2665.85s]  You can walk and aim. You can walk and aim. What's that? Sporting Good Store?
[2665.85s -> 2688.44s]  Come on. It's my turn. What? I need the hammer. Any hammers in here?

[2696.84s -> 2705.08s]  Boxing gloves. Do I get experience for this?
[2705.08s -> 2750.39s]  Holy shit. I actually did. Thousand. Come on. Break. Two completely different
[2750.39s -> 2765.19s]  recorded voice lines for the same thing. That's Spider-Man PS4 levels of awesome.
[2765.19s -> 2774.70s]  Okay. All right. Get out of my way. Orange juice is way better than soda.
[2774.70s -> 2784.57s]  The truck only has three recorded voice lines.
[2784.57s -> 2794.76s]  Does it only have one? That kind of sucks.
[2795.00s -> 2805.99s]  It's a giant craps table. This game is cool. Can I actually do this?
[2805.99s -> 2818.23s]  Can I actually play craps? Come on. What do I get? Four.
[2818.23s -> 2833.38s]  I have to bet. How do I bet? I gotta put a bet down.
[2833.38s -> 2843.77s]  Oh shit. That's outside of the playing area. I have to go get chips.
[2843.77s -> 2847.61s]  Okay. I'm gonna get addicted to some stuff in here. It's gonna be crazy.
[2847.61s -> 2860.47s]  I like the the feedback on that gun. We got jewelry store.
[2860.47s -> 2867.45s]  Money. Gems. Can I just like convert this into money?

[2878.18s -> 2889.59s]  Shopping boxes. All right. I don't want to run out of time.
[2889.59s -> 2893.75s]  There's a car. There's a car in the mall. And this is a drivable car.
[2893.83s -> 2902.50s]  In the mall. They're already. Oh come on.
[2902.50s -> 2910.01s]  I need shit that exists. It actually exists.
[2910.01s -> 2931.35s]  I just won 1200 bucks. All right. I'm done. Oh god. He's addicted. I just won
[2931.35s -> 2946.71s]  1200 dollars and got him walked away. Here. Am I going the right way?
[2946.71s -> 2960.70s]  Uh yes. It's right here. You sprayed on yourself first.
[2960.70s -> 2965.10s]  I want some more. I want some more coffee. Shit.
[2965.10s -> 2994.81s]  I just got like a little one. Hey. You have something better to do.
[2994.81s -> 2998.20s]  Why don't you mind your own business old man?
[2998.20s -> 3001.72s]  Just looking for some meds. No need to get ugly.
[3001.72s -> 3006.36s]  Well you're definitely gonna need some painkillers when I'm done with you.
[3006.36s -> 3010.36s]  Well talking to you is giving me a headache. Crowbar is not a great weapon.
[3010.36s -> 3014.20s]  What say you? Hard to swing. It's heavy. And I'll go get some for you.
[3014.20s -> 3022.30s]  Yeah. Give us some money grandpa. We'll help you.
[3022.62s -> 3029.18s]  Just a block of wood. It's actually. Do you know how heavy a crowbar actually is?
[3035.46s -> 3038.98s]  It turned your fucking friends green. Completely green.
[3051.26s -> 3069.32s]  Why did I call me grandpa? I'm like 41. I've had enough. I thought he was gonna drink it.
[3069.32s -> 3071.40s]  I thought he was gonna drink it. I was gonna let him take a sip.
[3087.50s -> 3091.18s]  Psycho. I was gonna let him get a nice swig before he died.
[3099.53s -> 3107.22s]  Crowbar. Double crowbar and hatchet. Oh shit. You're alive. All right hold on.
[3108.55s -> 3119.35s]  Do you mind if I take all this? Okay. I thought they were gonna kill me.
[3120.84s -> 3125.59s]  It's okay. You're safe now. Are you hurt? I think I'm okay. Thank you so much.
[3125.59s -> 3131.06s]  You got here before they. Before they. Listen. There's a safe house.
[3131.06s -> 3133.14s]  Well you'll be safe. Follow me and I'll take you there.
[3138.46s -> 3145.03s]  Dense? Is it Denise? Dense. There are survivors of the outbreak scattered through a fortune city.
[3146.42s -> 3151.13s]  Escort anyone you find back to the safe house. Though some might not come with you willingly.
[3152.65s -> 3157.29s]  Why is to call a survivor? Or you can press left trigger and y to send them to a location, right?
[3158.09s -> 3167.99s]  Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay. Follow me. Agreed. Hurry it up. Let's get the Zombrex. Anybody else here?
[3171.02s -> 3181.37s]  Zombrex. Frank will need a Zombrex at 8 a.m. It is high in demand, expensive, and hard to find.
[3181.45s -> 3188.66s]  The new and improved Zombrex formula lasts 24 hours. Zombrex overdoses are deadly. Oh no.
[3188.66s -> 3198.25s]  Users must never take it earlier than prescribed. I'm gonna have to save all the time.
[3198.81s -> 3202.65s]  The Zombrex counter on your HUD shows how much you have at all times.
[3203.29s -> 3208.25s]  Frank needs Zombrex every day between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m. If he doesn't get it, he will die.
[3209.58s -> 3215.54s]  So every day at 7 a.m. to 8 a.m. just scream at me. Check your watch to see if it's time
[3215.54s -> 3226.63s]  for your next dose. Okay. I have Zombrex. It's too early to inject myself. I can only inject
[3226.63s -> 3240.39s]  myself between 7 and 8 a.m. Give me that orange juice. Oh, I remember the computer. The computer
[3240.39s -> 3256.49s]  joke. It's all coming back to me. A defib. You alive? Now you're extra alive. All right. Let's
[3256.49s -> 3261.91s]  go. Quick. Follow me. Oh, there's orange juice everywhere, but I don't really need it. Actually,
[3261.91s -> 3272.02s]  you know what? Yeah, I'm gonna take another one. Let's go. So I need to take that Zombrex.
[3272.90s -> 3281.34s]  Actually, I should. Can you have the weapon? Here, come here. Give item. Here. I mean, like,
[3281.34s -> 3293.21s]  you're the doctor, so you take this. What? You're the doctor. You'll take an axe, but you won't take
[3293.21s -> 3307.27s]  a defib? All right. Okay. Uh, guide arrow. I need to go back to the safe house. Uh, is it already
[3307.27s -> 3319.86s]  guiding me? Or is this just, I have to take Zombrex at 7 a.m.? I swing. I swing down. Holy
[3319.86s -> 3332.25s]  shit. She's actually attacking zombies. All right. Um, where's the safe house from here?
[3332.25s -> 3340.66s]  Can I not move around? There we go. So, uh, safe house is, what is it? It's the green one.
[3341.86s -> 3348.84s]  Can I zoom out a little bit? It was back here, wasn't it? All right. I'm gonna set a waypoint
[3348.84s -> 3361.56s]  to here. Let's go back to the safe house. You all right? All right, let's move. We gotta go.
[3364.55s -> 3377.02s]  The bare feet can be accessed through the locker in the safe house. I love how that's being spammed.
[3377.98s -> 3381.18s]  Jeremy, bare feet. Is that available? Bare feet available.
[3391.50s -> 3404.54s]  What are you talking about? I feel like I'm superhero from Mystery Men.
[3406.65s -> 3423.72s]  I'm the defense. He's a wrestler. All right. Come on. Come on. Come on. This is one of the,
[3423.72s -> 3426.84s]  this is one of the people that they passed on during that whole montage. They're trying
[3426.84s -> 3441.29s]  to find superheroes. Look like Deadpool 2. Pick one. Come on. Speed it up. Keep up. Hey, I'm
[3441.29s -> 3451.43s]  waiting on you. Yeah. Deadpool 2 for zoomers. Mystery Men for boomers. I'm, I can, I make sure
[3451.43s -> 3472.04s]  that I address all audiences. She's like dead. Don't die. I can't lose the first survivor.
[3476.06s -> 3489.35s]  Right through there. Maybe get an actual weapon. I'm fine. Don't die. Don't die. Don't die.
[3497.58s -> 3512.50s]  I thought she just had a giant syringe for a second. Did somebody just say Monka S bare feet?
[3514.23s -> 3544.22s]  Why is that? Firecrackers. Dance. Look, those guys were stealing everything. Thanks for saving my
[3544.22s -> 3561.29s]  life. Where on earth did you find them? Nevermind. I don't want to know. We can't afford to have any
[3561.29s -> 3568.17s]  more infected in here. One's enough. Okay. Hey, any, where can I change into bare feet around here?
[3568.73s -> 3575.19s]  What the fuck are you talking about, Frank? Just take off your damn shoes and socks. What are you
[3575.19s -> 3580.76s]  talking about? Earned PP by killing zombies. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Let's you level up. Yep. Leveling
[3580.76s -> 3584.20s]  up, up, up, up. Let's you gain new skills, attributes, and even combo cards. Yes, it does.
[3589.67s -> 3610.39s]  New skill. Roundhouse kick. Hold right trigger and hold A. Drill bucket? Wait, what do you mean
[3610.39s -> 3630.52s]  combo cards? Pylon and spray paint is a bullhorn. Okay. Uh, status. Skills. Jump kick. Yeah.
[3631.48s -> 3637.74s]  Dodge roll. Click left stick. Good to know. Roundhouse. Hold right trigger and hold A.
[3638.38s -> 3649.69s]  All right. So what's the problem? Hold right trigger and hold A. I'm in the safe house. Nevermind.
[3649.69s -> 3659.05s]  All right. So, um, what time is it? I got to inject myself. It is 6 17 a.m. I have to take
[3659.05s -> 3681.51s]  an injection in like 15 minutes. This is fine. Safe house fun. Just chilling before an injection.
[3681.51s -> 3703.37s]  That's right. All right. What is that? Which one is it? This one here? The locker? Sweet.
[3703.85s -> 3720.97s]  Okay. Oh, I just put on like tap shoes. Oh, whatever. All right. Time check. It is 6 30.
[3720.97s -> 3725.38s]  Time to take an injection in a few minutes. Just going here. There's probably a cut scene here
[3725.38s -> 3736.30s]  after as well. Glad you found some zombricks, but it's not time to take it yet. I need my daily dose
[3736.30s -> 3752.30s]  between 7 and 8 a.m. I'll take it then. Can you take this anywhere? Can you hear me? Can anyone
[3752.30s -> 3763.99s]  hear somebody? Somebody. Don't run with scissors. This is a zombie outbreak. All right. 6 35 a.m.
[3764.79s -> 3774.57s]  Give me the fire extinguisher too. And okay. Cool. Hey, is the Star Wars game any good?
[3776.38s -> 3785.24s]  Anyone like know anything about it? The one, the one just coming out like in three days,
[3785.24s -> 3800.15s]  four days, whatever it is. Is it good? Anybody know? That's a lot of orange juice. All right.
[3800.15s -> 3809.46s]  Few minutes. I can take it. How the fuck are we supposed to know? I don't know. Have you guys been
[3809.46s -> 3814.98s]  paying attention to it? I don't know. Did anybody like play it? Any, any journalists in here?
[3816.14s -> 3818.94s]  Although that you can't even tell me anyways because you're probably under like an NDA.
[3825.35s -> 3831.46s]  The previews look good. I don't know. I just know it's coming out in a few days. I don't know if
[3831.46s -> 3835.14s]  some games, the review copies have already been out for a while. Maybe I just didn't know if
[3835.14s -> 3848.28s]  those views are out or who's there? All right, we go. 651 incoming. Reviews come out on Thursday.
[3848.28s -> 3872.15s]  All right. 653 incoming. Drama. Go do stuff. I feel like I'm gonna have to be right here. All
[3872.15s -> 3886.70s]  right. I've got only got like an hour. I'm done. It's time to take it. You can do it anywhere.
[3886.70s -> 3896.71s]  Oh, okay. Okay. Well, it says destination safe house and that doesn't know the destination is
[3899.90s -> 3917.40s]  7 a.m. That's it. Okay. So now what? Start at 8 a.m. Nothing to do now. But wait, Stacey will call me.
[3918.30s -> 3941.38s]  Fuck. All right. Well, let's set a waypoint to, um, let's go out to, is it a gas station?
[3941.38s -> 3954.76s]  That's a car. Whatever. Just go this way. Go out and try the sweet roundhouse kit. Get the scissors
[3954.76s -> 3966.58s]  suck. Just don't gamble for an hour. No, I'm not. I'm just gonna go kill stuff
[3966.58s -> 3985.21s]  and go find some more costume stuff. Okay. Well, I can. Hey, I can take you right now.
[3987.40s -> 3992.12s]  Lady, it's Sandra Dawkins and hell no, I ain't all right. My good-for-nothing husband left me out
[3992.12s -> 3998.58s]  here. I remember this part. Don't you have to? Okay. I've played the first couple hours of this
[3998.58s -> 4008.54s]  game. Okay. Watch out behind you. Watch out behind you. Watch out behind you. Watch out behind you.
[4009.50s -> 4023.82s]  All right, let's go. All right. What did you say? Oh, you got a weapon. Oh, yeah. You got like a
[4023.82s -> 4040.70s]  wrench. Oh, my. I'm hitting her in the head over and over again. All right. Um, I didn't, I, where
[4040.70s -> 4062.57s]  was it? Was it right here? It's like right here, isn't it? Cafe. Casual gals.
[4067.99s -> 4079.30s]  Keep up. Here. Take some orange juice. Here. Take orange juice. I'm trying to stop. I know. You're
[4079.30s -> 4099.14s]  locked in. Like aggression is taking over. Come here. No. Gordon Dawkins. There you are.
[4109.62s -> 4114.97s]  All right. Come here. Come here. I hate to break up this lovely reunion, but this is not safe out here.
[4114.97s -> 4129.30s]  Take this. He's right. Let's go. Yes, dear. Gordon has joined. Here. Take. Drink it. Okay, you have
[4129.30s -> 4138.26s]  this back. No, no, no. Come back. Come back. No. Take this back. Take this back. Take this back.
[4139.06s -> 4149.62s]  Yes, use that. Take it. No, I didn't want to. Okay. Okay. Well, we've all been well fed.
[4150.58s -> 4160.54s]  Take this. Okay. Let's move. You want orange juice or what? All right. Back to the safe house.
[4164.55s -> 4185.42s]  Let's go. That way. Let's go. Roundhouse kick. It's a pretty shitty roundhouse kick. It's really,
[4185.42s -> 4209.93s]  it's too low. Let's go. Frank is my age. How old is Frank in this game? 50. Follow me. You guys
[4209.93s -> 4220.14s]  making it? Yeah. Can I have, give me your stuff back? I want that back. Sorry. Why does nobody
[4220.14s -> 4236.70s]  want this? I want to throw them. Keep up. It's because it sucks. Urgent. Frank, they're starting
[4236.70s -> 4243.78s]  to report the outbreak on the news. You should come back and watch this. All right. Well, let's
[4243.78s -> 4252.15s]  go back to the safe house. Two more people. It's all that we have received a broadcast from our
[4252.15s -> 4259.54s]  Phil Kachang who is inside Fortune City. Don't tease me like that.
[4264.74s -> 4269.14s]  I wish I could drink that right now. I love just shitty dirty
[4269.14s -> 4271.14s]  coffee pot coffee. It's like my favorite thing.
[4277.70s -> 4283.62s]  Okay. This is how fucked up my brain is. I was about to like just send Kim a text.
[4285.86s -> 4289.70s]  Hey, could you throw on a pot of coffee for me? And I opened up Twitter
[4289.70s -> 4292.50s]  and was about to write, Hey, can you throw a pot of coffee on for me?
[4293.06s -> 4310.68s]  That the man is reality as their complete no statement of response has been received.
[4310.68s -> 4315.40s]  This horrible act of terror appears to be an escalation of violence for the protest
[4315.40s -> 4331.54s]  group. This is the picture on that screen. Where the hell did that come from? Liar. It came from
[4331.54s -> 4339.22s]  the security cameras, lady. What the hell were you thinking? Your group's got a reputation,
[4339.22s -> 4346.25s]  but come on. Cure had nothing to do with this. It's pretty easy to say that, isn't it? You're
[4346.25s -> 4355.16s]  going to need more than that. Better start talking, right? I'm telling you, we're being set up. We've
[4355.16s -> 4358.60s]  been accused of things before, but we don't believe in violence. Did I just send that to the wrong
[4358.60s -> 4362.52s]  fucking person? It's someone's convenient excuse. No, really. What am I going to say? What is wrong
[4362.52s -> 4365.72s]  with me? It's not the first time members of Cure have been falsely accused of being involved with
[4365.80s -> 4377.46s]  an outbreak. I've got to find whoever leaked that tape. Like an old real estate agent or something.
[4378.34s -> 4388.78s]  Hey, can you put a pot of coffee on for me? What's going on with this game?
[4388.78s -> 4395.48s]  Where is she? She said she was in the hotel. I know this could end up being a big chance for
[4395.48s -> 4400.60s]  your career. It's not internet related. It's just... This could mean my life. Video game
[4400.60s -> 4412.81s]  hardware reception. Level up. New skill move acquired. All right. Case one two engaged.
[4413.53s -> 4423.56s]  I need to find out what that Rebecca Chang knows. We got it. Would you like to save your progress?
[4423.56s -> 4442.18s]  Sure, I would. Dead rising for the switch. Pretty great, actually. You found yourself caught in the
[4442.18s -> 4445.70s]  Fortune City outbreak. Track down clues to uncover the truth about what happened.
[4446.34s -> 4454.66s]  Restore your name and escape from the city. Okay. Time until the military comes 72 hours 56 minutes
[4454.66s -> 4469.61s]  55 seconds. Leveled up. All right. Back to exploring. All right. That's really cool.
[4469.61s -> 4475.29s]  What move did I just learn? Find the reporter in the Fortune City hotel. I need to find that
[4475.29s -> 4483.08s]  reporter in the hotel lobby. You got it. But for now, but first front kick. Hold R T and press A.
[4486.90s -> 4492.71s]  I got... I'm good. Get out of my way. Maintenance room key acquired.
[4495.48s -> 4501.30s]  Maintenance room key acquired. Promise everyone. Maintenance room key lets you access all maintenance
[4501.30s -> 4504.82s]  rooms in Fortune City. Maintenance rooms will let you make powerful combo weapons.
[4505.46s -> 4509.70s]  Maintenance rooms are located throughout Fortune City. Bright red doors and neon signs are easily
[4509.70s -> 4515.24s]  visible from a distance. Good. Maintenance room is always within reach. Just check your maintenance
[4515.24s -> 4520.90s]  rooms map. They're always marked with the wrench icon. Cool.
[4528.17s -> 4541.11s]  Take it. It's yours. Thanks. Okay. So they have... Oh, they all have little things on them.
[4541.11s -> 4543.83s]  There's a guy playing the slots. Okay. You don't have to read it.
[4547.78s -> 4550.10s]  I'll go check on him. I'll go sit down with him and join him.
[4553.34s -> 4564.97s]  Know when to fold them. I'm going to go join this guy. So that means it can be combined. That's
[4564.97s -> 4598.04s]  cool. All right. Let's craft. Yeah, let's do it. Know when to fold the slots. Spiked Bat is
[4598.04s -> 4603.16s]  baseball bat in box of nails. Combo cards give you the recipe to build powerful combo weapons.
[4603.72s -> 4608.28s]  Cards you have found are all in the combo card screen. Killing with combo weapons gives you
[4608.28s -> 4615.40s]  bonus PP. You can level up faster and kill more zombies. So that's like... I want to make that
[4615.40s -> 4620.60s]  thing. That's like Barney the dinosaur eating a bunch of rocket pops. Whatever that thing does.
[4620.60s -> 4624.60s]  Explosions. Fireworks. Try building more combo weapons using items from around the city. They're
[4624.60s -> 4632.31s]  easy to spot. They all have a wrench. Speaking of which, I want one of those bad. All right.
[4632.31s -> 4661.24s]  Let's see what I got. DFib. Baseball bat and DFib. They only combo if they blow. Oh. All right.
[4661.24s -> 4675.06s]  Well, can I do anything with this? DFib and bucket. DFib and cone. How about cone and bucket?
[4676.68s -> 4689.42s]  What would that make? A bigger bucket? All right. I got my spiked bat. Wait. Oh, thousands.
[4692.02s -> 4697.14s]  How many gallons of milk do I have in my fridge right now? I don't like, I don't have like none.
[4697.14s -> 4702.92s]  I don't have like regular milk. Regular milk gives you diarrhea. It does to me.
[4705.16s -> 4709.58s]  What you got? One of those looters. Looks like one of those looters has set up a pawn shop inside
[4709.58s -> 4716.81s]  Moe's imaginations. He might have something for you. Okay. Well, I need to, we gotta go because
[4717.77s -> 4737.58s]  just trying to get pp with poor Grace. Nice shitty weapon. They can only be combined. I'll
[4737.58s -> 4752.14s]  figure out the combinations. What? Holy shit. Oh man. They have different, oh that's awesome.
[4753.43s -> 4764.12s]  They don't got this shit in the base game, do they? Yes, they do. I know.
[4765.08s -> 4788.49s]  I know. I know. Is it a wheelchair? Wait. Funny costume stuff. Can I put it on? Kids superhero
[4788.49s -> 4808.66s]  boots. This is like Santa wakes up at 3 a.m. to drink milk out of the fridge. Which by the way,
[4808.66s -> 4820.81s]  gross. And what's the point of having, all right, I, this button's at the top. But what on earth
[4820.81s -> 4824.65s]  are the buttons on the back for? Is that to change, is that to change like a diaper or something?
[4824.65s -> 4836.82s]  I don't know. I've never known what that is for. This is to poo. Why we, that's disgusting.
[4837.46s -> 4857.86s]  What the hell was that? Who's talking? I hear somebody talking. It's a onesie. Look at the top.
[4857.86s -> 4860.42s]  It buttons all the way down to the, to the, to like the crockery area.
[4861.86s -> 4882.26s]  Shit, this is ridiculous. Okay. Somebody's in it. Get out of the way. Wait, this is a whole casino.
[4882.26s -> 4885.22s]  Oh no, I'm never going to get out of here. I'm never going to be able to leave.
[4891.80s -> 4904.68s]  Oh shit. Okay. I got to find this guy. Don't play any of these machines. It's a waste of money.
[4905.50s -> 4908.78s]  This roulette, you can actually play roulette. No, you can't.
[4913.14s -> 4916.42s]  Damn it. I thought I had the big one for sure. Oh well, I'll go again.
[4917.69s -> 4930.39s]  Bill, Bill, we got to talk. Bill, buddy, you doing okay? I like slots too, but you might want to
[4930.95s -> 4935.43s]  wait things out the safe house. That's a nice idea. But I got money to win back. I ain't leaving
[4935.43s -> 4945.80s]  without it. Might not be the best time with all these zombies around. Hang on there sweetie. Good
[4945.80s -> 4952.28s]  things come to those who wait. You can gamble. Why don't you just break them? Just smash them.
[4954.65s -> 4958.57s]  You can run along to your safe house and be like, I'm down $20,000 and I'm not going
[4958.57s -> 4967.53s]  anywhere until I have made that money back. Oh my, I have to give you $20,000? What if I break
[4967.53s -> 4984.02s]  his machine? How about another $5,000? Bill, a little advice for you. There's some pretty
[4984.02s -> 4995.90s]  greedy folks here in Fortune City. Might do well to keep some cash handy. Bill, here. Okay. Well,
[4998.46s -> 5011.58s]  take the knife. All right. Now watch out. Let me show you how it's done. Hey, back up.
[5023.46s -> 5053.02s]  Come on. One more. I didn't mean to drink the fucking orange juice. I meant to switch to the
[5053.02s -> 5064.36s]  bad. I got it all back. Don't worry. Okay, let's go. Bill, come with me. Case one, two. Not yet.
[5065.24s -> 5070.04s]  One man's trash. We're close. Not that close, but see if we can do it. This is the pawn shop.
[5070.76s -> 5104.12s]  Holy shit, there's a bolt. Ride the thunder. What do I win? $2,000. Oh shit. I'm wasting all my money.
[5105.24s -> 5116.06s]  $5,000.
[5134.36s -> 5138.78s]  It's like just my sweat covered hands is what happened. All right, Bill, let's go.
[5142.92s -> 5165.10s]  Drinking all the drinks. No. Let's go to the pawn shop. Bill, are you good?
[5165.82s -> 5182.17s]  It's time for the casino later. Who cares about Bill? I'm going to get the PP from Bill. He was
[5182.17s -> 5206.39s]  $25,000. 70 hours. All right, let's get this pawn shop. The knife sucks. I need to combine
[5206.39s -> 5226.86s]  this to make a better knife. This thing's terrible. No. I gotta get Bill some food.
[5231.00s -> 5252.89s]  You can do it. Snacks over here probably, right? $100 for snacks? Quick, eat, eat, eat.
[5262.25s -> 5278.71s]  No, I'm trying to pick up the bat. Bill. Bouncing beauty. Propane tank and rocket fireworks.
[5283.45s -> 5303.03s]  Eat these. All right, I need to get that fucking bat. Here, take this. Keep moving.
[5307.06s -> 5317.56s]  All the health you just gained is gone. How do you not? He's lost more HP. Bill's gonna die.
[5317.56s -> 5347.58s]  You were $20,000, Bill. My chest. God damn it. Shit. Loot him. He had a gun this whole time?
[5354.06s -> 5373.32s]  Holy shit, he had multiple guns. Bill, I just want the gun. Get away from me. Go. All right, out.
[5373.80s -> 5397.69s]  Save scum? No, I can't save scum. No save scumming. It's my own damn fault. Holy, I just got that
[5397.69s -> 5401.93s]  guy from across the world. All right, one man's trash. Here we go. Stuff for sale.
[5403.93s -> 5410.98s]  See what I just did? Wait a minute, you. You're one of those punks that tried to jump me in Roy's
[5410.98s -> 5418.39s]  Mart. Whatever. Might have been one of my pals, grandpa. We're just businessmen seeking out
[5418.47s -> 5424.65s]  merchandise for our shop. Feel free to browse any of our four pawn shops set up around Fortune
[5424.65s -> 5429.85s]  City. There's this one here and the others. We've got lots of valuable merchandise, pal. I wouldn't
[5429.85s -> 5442.90s]  turn your nose up at it. We can really help you out if a GM will do it. Let's go. Wacky hammer?
[5443.54s -> 5462.50s]  Okay, I'll take a wacky hammer, please. Is this costing money? Soldier goggles. $2 million.
[5462.50s -> 5471.74s]  $1,000 bucks. 15,000. Zombrex. 50 grand. I need that. Hey, any leads? I can see two guys.
[5476.94s -> 5494.15s]  Can I wear this? What? Can I please wear this? How do I get on? How do I pedal?
[5498.76s -> 5504.97s]  Okay, yeah, I remember this. All right, let's see what we got. Welcome to the family. Let's do
[5504.97s -> 5524.41s]  welcome to the family. Welcome to the family, son. This is slower than walking. This cannot
[5524.41s -> 5532.71s]  go upstairs. That's next level. That deserves at least 2,000 pub champs in the chat, I think.
[5547.86s -> 5565.75s]  Upgrade. All right, welcome to the family. Is everybody in the casino? I can't take this with
[5566.71s -> 5572.12s]  me. Oh, you guys are in the casino. Oh, damn it.
[5576.57s -> 5586.87s]  Excuse me. Is it downgrade if you ask me? I know. What was the new move? Just a kick. Nice. It's
[5586.87s -> 5615.29s]  pretty good. Atlantica. What's that on ground? Beer? I'll take a beer. It's the same thing
[5615.29s -> 5624.28s]  because it was a dolphin this time instead of a bull. How did I miss you? I have to drink beer now.
[5625.08s -> 5650.55s]  You can combine it with Molotov, I'm assuming, right? Yeah. Treasure chest. Money. I'm just using
[5650.55s -> 5655.27s]  my wrist to try to break that. That's not going to happen. I don't want to break this. I'm going to
[5655.27s -> 5692.92s]  play them later. Get off of me. Dude, go on the pirate ship. Eventually. Pirate ship now. No,
[5692.92s -> 5708.25s]  not yet. We'll get on the pirate ship in 15 minutes from now. We've got dynamic lighting in here and
[5708.25s -> 5725.67s]  it's making me drop down to like 50 fps. You're a shit PC. That's where you're wrong. I have
[5726.86s -> 5762.23s]  a intermediate level PC. This is nice. Come on. All the way out. Whipped cream can?
[5767.10s -> 5789.14s]  What? Oh, wow. Really? Oh, I want to eat this. Why is there a chainsaw back here and a key?
[5794.63s -> 5797.27s]  Use blenders to mix food items together and to mix drinks. Yep.
[5798.31s -> 5802.94s]  I have special bonuses. There are different types of mixed drinks. Each one with its own special
[5802.94s -> 5834.33s]  power. Yep. I gotta move. Where is this? In the corner? I dropped the chainsaw. How the
[5834.33s -> 5855.77s]  fuck did I do that? Get that dang thing off your head. I'm here. I brought the wheat cutter.
[5855.77s -> 5867.35s]  All right. Kenneth and Jack. Is that Proto Man? Is it Zero? Proto Man? Who is this? Are they all
[5867.35s -> 5873.46s]  gone? I hate those things. We gotta get out of here. They're more coming. I can get you to safety.
[5873.46s -> 5881.26s]  Why is he looking at me like that with a knife out? What's he doing? What is he doing? I really
[5881.26s -> 5889.16s]  love my wife, but it's like he doesn't like me at all. Can you help? Thanks stranger. The name's
[5889.16s -> 5893.64s]  Kenneth. Me and my loser for a son-in-law are trying to bond as my daughter says.
[5894.20s -> 5900.52s]  Follow me back to the safe house. It's too dangerous out here. Sounds good, but my daughter
[5900.52s -> 5904.92s]  Casimina would probably kill me if something happened to her dimwit poker fiend of a husband.
[5904.92s -> 5911.11s]  Better see if he's up to leaving. He's the fool over there in the helmet. All right. We're all
[5911.11s -> 5929.78s]  going. Let's go. He's trying to kill me. I'm not like a snake, man. Stop. Let's go. I want to play
[5929.78s -> 5939.30s]  a little poker. Let's go. Jack is joined. Kenneth is joined. Okay. Bowie knife. Here. You need this.
[5941.96s -> 5953.32s]  What else we got in here? Cleaver. Here. Stop like taunting at ringside. Here. Take this.
[5960.55s -> 5963.35s]  There's food. Anything else back here? There's like french fries and shit. Hold on.
[5964.15s -> 5999.48s]  All right. Let's move back to the safe house. Take the bow and fucking arrow. This thing sucks.
[5999.96s -> 6018.81s]  That was a headshot. I have french fries and bow and arrows. The side. No, I'm taking the side.
[6018.81s -> 6040.86s]  This thing sucks. Take the claymore. Oh god damn it. Claymore? Where's a claymore? Oh fuck. There's
[6040.86s -> 6056.23s]  a giant sword in here. Somebody open this. Where's the claymore? This is the claymore. I thought you
[6056.23s -> 6060.55s]  meant a bomb. I thought you meant like an explosive like plastic claymore thing.
[6062.23s -> 6073.58s]  Okay. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. He's played too much cod.
[6074.22s -> 6092.02s]  Kenneth. God damn it. Holy shit. People die so much quicker in this game. Take some french fries
[6092.02s -> 6105.43s]  before you die. Take some french fries quick please. All right. Let's go. Right. Take a lot.
[6105.43s -> 6117.86s]  There's a large soda here too. I can't man. I don't want to swing. Get them soda. Get the large soda.
[6123.24s -> 6129.85s]  I look like I'm trying to be a Mega Man character by and saving money while doing so. All right.

[6329.16s -> 6348.81s]  in that. See people not nice. This is really did I walk into a boss fight?
[6351.46s -> 6358.87s]  I have to fight a tiger. The last time I saved was so long ago.

[6376.84s -> 6384.47s]  Dude. That was fucking easy.
[6394.07s -> 6406.26s]  The tiger sprinted away and then he stood there and got stun locked. No loyalty apparently.
[6443.08s -> 6449.14s]  Wait was was this person not going to attack me?
[6457.75s -> 6465.10s]  The cat is uh fucking running around back there. Gems and leaf blower.

[6500.58s -> 6516.38s]  Oh no please. Motherfucker. You opportunist asshole. I don't have any food.
[6525.05s -> 6533.40s]  Oh shit. I was supposed to save the game. Oh my god. I have to fucking. Give me a beer.
[6533.40s -> 6539.32s]  Somebody. Do it. Fight something. Cat come. Can the cat come downstairs? Just beer on the ground.
[6549.83s -> 6576.47s]  Meat on bone. Yeah they take so much more damage than this one. Jack dead. Jack dead. Feed the
[6576.47s -> 6586.95s]  tiger. Um I think I got more of a problem on my hands here. Feed tiger. Go tame the tiger. I'm
[6587.35s -> 6603.42s]  dead. And so are these two guys that I'm with. They're both dead. How the fuck am I supposed to.
[6609.53s -> 6614.66s]  Wait is it food? Holy shit. I thought these. I thought this was meat. I thought it was meat.
[6614.66s -> 6640.74s]  It's foam hands. He's puking. He's dead man. It's over. Holy shit. This is a disaster.
[6641.70s -> 6648.60s]  Oh I'm gonna die too. I'm just trying to save the damn game and I walk into a tiger.
[6660.71s -> 6671.38s]  Shit. Oh well. I gotta get in there. Uh Frank there seems to be a dancer throwing up in there.
[6673.88s -> 6705.78s]  So? What do you. The janitor. Somebody puked in the uh by the uh you know by the where's the gold
[6705.78s -> 6738.41s]  slot machine. Uh I guess I'll take. Well sure. Very cool. All right. Wait what time is it?
[6739.13s -> 6747.66s]  So this is find the reporter which is straight ahead here. How much time do I have? Not very
[6747.66s -> 6752.86s]  much but that's not that far away. The save point's right in the mill. I'm so sad right now.
[6754.78s -> 6755.74s]  I'm so sad.
[6761.91s -> 6778.52s]  I wanted to save those too. There's a weed whacker right here. There's a maintenance room in here.
[6778.52s -> 6796.84s]  Oh shit. Hold on. Excuse me. Goodbye. All right. So wait. Hold on. Place item. Wait. Knife and
[6796.84s -> 6816.79s]  battery? Wait a minute. Knife and. Knife and weed whacker. Holy shit. Okay. Um what can I do with
[6816.79s -> 6826.23s]  bow and arrow? Bow and arrow and battery? Can I make like electric bow? Damn it. Lawnmower
[6827.27s -> 6836.07s]  and knife? Lawnmower and battery? Lawnmower and board of wood.
[6836.71s -> 6862.09s]  Oh yeah. A port of mower. Scratch cards let you know what you need to make a combo weapon
[6862.09s -> 6868.36s]  but they're not as good as combo cards. Scratch cards mean less pp from combo weapons. You also
[6868.36s -> 6874.20s]  cannot perform strong attacks. Replace your scratch cards with real combo cards as soon as you can.
[6876.04s -> 6886.70s]  You can find combo cards everywhere. Scratch cards? Okay. Shit. I can only bring one
[6887.34s -> 6901.77s]  which is better. Oh I gotta go. All right. Where's that save point right there?
[6902.49s -> 6916.44s]  That's a lot of pp. Just in case I run into a huge problem.
[6923.91s -> 6936.92s]  Okay let's go. Game is saved. You just have to bump into people with this.
[6936.92s -> 6954.25s]  Exactly. These things are actually great. You don't even need to use it. You're not killing them? I
[6954.25s -> 6980.58s]  know but it's just I'm just trying to get through. Now what? Cat is back.

[7397.18s -> 7399.90s]  nice i need a different weapon
[7402.30s -> 7408.55s]  but no what i said earlier but what i was saying is it so it doesn't matter what happens
[7409.35s -> 7416.63s]  luigi if it's scary if it's exciting luigi always has the same reaction
[7418.97s -> 7437.13s]  oh yeah oh oh it happens every 15 to 20 seconds can you do something about this guy
[7439.45s -> 7445.66s]  i didn't say i didn't like it it's a really fun game
[7461.30s -> 7478.87s]  journalism school could have fooled me hey bro what a mess well this just gets better and better
[7478.87s -> 7483.59s]  going to school for journalism lol it looks like somebody didn't like the show much you should get
[7483.59s -> 7492.79s]  this on video you guys the internet may have changed a lot of things they didn't want us to
[7492.79s -> 7506.22s]  see what really went down but like 15 20 years ago you couldn't do it on a computer zombies don't
[7506.22s -> 7513.16s]  use guns not so sure here's not involved but it definitely proves someone's covering up what
[7513.16s -> 7521.80s]  really happened not a bad lead kiddo those pictures frank frank those are laptop motherboards
[7522.68s -> 7534.26s]  what is it stacy yeah he saw the report can you get back here wait who is that just a friend
[7534.82s -> 7543.93s]  the leader of cure gotta go i gotta get out of here he can't ditch me for long that's what the
[7543.93s -> 7562.15s]  lag i have no idea someone's destroyed the security room well i lose the game um okay so
[7562.15s -> 7574.60s]  i lose i have to go out i need heels i'm dead why did i break that i need the fucking

[7604.10s -> 7606.50s]  so something that i didn't have to do in the last dead rising
[7607.64s -> 7609.08s]  uh but i'm probably gonna have to do here is
[7611.38s -> 7617.35s]  you realistically replay dead rising like three or four times we might have to do that
[7631.14s -> 7637.69s]  let's go 100 bucks for cheetahs yeah that's kind of insane
[7637.69s -> 7641.29s]  but i i don't know exactly how much time i have left it's not very much
[7641.29s -> 7673.59s]  yes it's sort of possible it is it's maybe remotely possible how far away am i
[7675.98s -> 7685.30s]  it's gonna be it's gonna be impossible but we'll see i might actually be able to do it if i just
[7685.30s -> 7699.94s]  haul ass at the last save that i had use a wheelchair i'm about to lose yes damn it
[7703.54s -> 7711.00s]  it might be possible if i can there's a money machine well this just became one of my favorite

[12479.82s -> 12487.64s]  looks like this in industrial fashion i don't think i can do this i think i just have to go back
[12487.64s -> 12500.70s]  so far away look at this across the whole damn game all right um the fastest way is to just go
[12500.70s -> 12518.65s]  through just bang a left and just go across through the uh fortune park let's go everybody
[12518.65s -> 12524.73s]  has a weapon let's go let's just try to make it happen just stick together stick on stay on the

[13076.17s -> 13087.59s]  okay why do i have to go across the whole fucking game why and it's broken oh this is a disaster
[13088.47s -> 13108.47s]  this is a trillion zombies fire bomb i
[13115.88s -> 13122.49s]  all right so half the comments say just run the other half say

[13174.38s -> 13197.18s]  man there's no way you gotta be fucking kidding me i can't fucking believe it are you serious
[13202.42s -> 13208.57s]  so you're telling me that if i just run like this and just don't stop they'll find a way to go
[13208.57s -> 13223.14s]  through the zombies but that doesn't make any sense because sometimes they do get caught
[13230.94s -> 13238.70s]  they just break free it's not like the first game
[13259.06s -> 13282.31s]  i can't believe it i can't believe it you just have to run and don't look at them
[13283.21s -> 13302.33s]  and they'll make it through thank you man he won the comedy trophy but he didn't win his life
[13303.05s -> 13318.14s]  okay that's pretty awesome all right i gotta do this case i gotta save the game do the case

[15246.01s -> 15252.44s]  although hold on let me be fair here for a second i'm gonna be really fair because i'm being very
[15252.44s -> 15261.19s]  unfair i tried to make them get hit by the pirate ship like five to ten times each this is very
[15261.19s -> 15270.17s]  unfair so that's a completely incorrect statement what i just said like i trying to get a photo of
[15270.17s -> 15286.66s]  them dying so i killed them okay um i'm accepting my my fault there and the picture wasn't even very
[15288.34s -> 15308.70s]  we're gonna go right in the middle just in case i get sad was the uh the picture viewer case file
[15309.34s -> 15343.96s]  no the other one was so much better unfortunately it was so good oh well you can pull it from the
[15343.96s -> 15352.76s]  stream yeah all right let me look at my combo cards okay machine gun and wheelchair
[15357.74s -> 15366.39s]  so case three one has a lot of time i need the zombrex pawn shop then there's also industrial
[15366.39s -> 15371.53s]  fashion which that's kind of far away tastes like chicken i gotta get a better view of this let me
[15371.53s -> 15383.46s]  let me get the zombrex first and put a waypoint checking moves yeah okay snapshot hold take a
[15383.46s -> 15390.46s]  picture with your new buddy zombies hold right trigger and press right bumper so is that a selfie
[15391.35s -> 15397.93s]  while the camera is out grab the head of a zombie and smash it into the floor
[15398.73s -> 15402.25s]  otis would hate to have to clean this up hold the right trigger and press b
[15403.77s -> 15405.85s]  so wait it's i can't do it in here
[15409.10s -> 15422.52s]  i guess hey rare pepe body lotion thank you for the five subs all right let's get the map out
[15422.52s -> 15433.67s]  uh i want to zoom this out we need to go here no pawn shop there's a pawn shop
[15435.51s -> 15440.92s]  like this closest one probably right here yeah it's probably the closest one
[15443.08s -> 15460.86s]  let's go that axe isn't there orange juice and shit yeah there is change outfit um i'm not sure
[15460.86s -> 15470.41s]  i can i do have these moon shoes on so i agree it does look pretty stupid all right i got
[15470.41s -> 15499.80s]  let's go oh second floor right here okay let's move when do we get a health upgrade
[15500.52s -> 15508.89s]  would you care what someone did i have literally i'm not going to read the rest of that
[15509.69s -> 15518.15s]  well i'll read the second part what would somebody would do with your body in general after you're
[15518.15s -> 15526.22s]  gone like organ stuff yeah if i like died and they like somebody needed my liver then fucking
[15526.30s -> 15544.31s]  take it i gotta be dead though you get it when i was like alive
[15554.06s -> 15568.60s]  oh okay i have fifty seven thousand dollars i also need to find an atm
[15569.96s -> 15583.29s]  it's up i'm here to buy that zombrex it's a lot of money well there goes my retirement fund
[15584.01s -> 15599.24s]  um what the fuck is going on what is happening to me are they killing me
[15606.33s -> 15613.70s]  where am i i'm not in the vent there's just bombs being thrown
[15643.88s -> 15645.24s]  oh
[15648.15s -> 15666.87s]  give me a weapon give me a fucking weapon can i take a picture
[15669.19s -> 15681.58s]  what who is taking this photo wait wait wait wait don't kill me no i'm trying to get the
[15681.58s -> 15701.48s]  camera in the face the other way what do i do now take a picture of my own ass
[15701.88s -> 15713.00s]  oh zoom in i can't zoom in
[15724.33s -> 15756.15s]  um i'm outside no i'm not turn left left some more left turn left a little bit more i'm almost
[15756.15s -> 15806.87s]  outside i'm outside i think i just jumped off the balcony oh do i have a checkpoint after buying
[15807.67s -> 15844.87s]  the zombrex you didn't even get it yeah i did it's okay let's try this again so i'm trying to think
[15844.87s -> 15851.27s]  of how that may have i'm trying to think how that may have happened and the one thing i can think of
[15851.27s -> 15859.58s]  is when i bought the zombrex at the same exact time somebody tried to grab me and the game
[15859.58s -> 15867.74s]  freaked out one of those thieves tried to grab me right because that's what happens
[15867.74s -> 15876.25s]  and see what happens if we do this again because it was immediately right when i pressed the button
[15876.89s -> 15896.33s]  snacks all right up the stairs maybe it probably put me on the table that the zombrex is on
[15896.33s -> 15901.29s]  that's also another good theory atms here we go all right let's hope this doesn't happen again
[15901.29s -> 15931.66s]  because i'm about to get money out of the atm 40 grand okay this time here we are just wait a
[15931.66s -> 15945.46s]  second okay here he comes he made it in here much faster battle axe he's got one of those
[15945.46s -> 15954.42s]  devices too another one i'll take it um i how many how many he's getting
[15960.10s -> 15962.58s]  really he was these three
[15965.70s -> 15967.22s]  am i really that far away
[15967.62s -> 15973.83s]  so um
[15977.83s -> 15998.52s]  that's what this does items you fucking asshole what did he take oh god i just want to buy the
[15998.52s -> 16026.28s]  zombrex leave me alone hi oh no what is going on with this and i can't i can't change any
[16026.28s -> 16044.04s]  way weapons or anything go in the vent try a selfie so it's right holding right trigger and
[16044.04s -> 16056.04s]  then right bumper say before buying go to the other store how do you do a selfie is it left
[16056.04s -> 16080.38s]  trigger right trigger right no it's right trigger right bumper right well time to die again um do
[16080.38s -> 16093.27s]  i have it do i have doing i don't have the zombrex it's just on the ground there it is
[16093.27s -> 16106.42s]  is um i'm afraid to buy anything else the sports car keys a million dollars

[16119.29s -> 16126.06s]  what time is it right now it's 5 a.m all right industrial fashion i might have time to do this
[16126.78s -> 16157.51s]  game yeah that's also part of the plan that's also part of the plan atm show this evil people
[16170.76s -> 16177.08s]  bunch more money i could buy another one all right well not yet see if i can do this
[16180.49s -> 16198.10s]  i gotta save the game too let me eat some shit all right save game we're gonna go down
[16199.62s -> 16204.25s]  and then there's a save behind us
[16232.58s -> 16258.41s]  okay save the game uh i'm gonna end up triggering the cutscene i don't want to fight him right now
[16258.41s -> 16266.41s]  i'm gonna lose i mean should i just fight him how do i i don't have anything i got nothing to

[17089.90s -> 17107.85s]  pretty good i just can't put it down just don't let it go let's see if i can do it go ahead cut
[17107.93s -> 17122.04s]  scene okay okay i never put it down except for when you have to lock him into the wall

[17179.27s -> 17220.22s]  way katie katie katie okay you're safe now i can't imagine what i would do if anything

[17827.72s -> 17846.02s]  you look always borrow money from a pessimist he won't expect it back when was the last time
[17846.02s -> 17857.06s]  i saved the game i i was assuming i was gonna get like 50 000 p or something i saved it okay
[17857.06s -> 17863.54s]  let's see what the next one is you're prestigious and your actions great and small all right that's
[17863.54s -> 17879.82s]  a lot but how much was the next one 50 000 that's not worth doing somebody kill me

[24651.27s -> 24656.39s]  thanks for the 250 bits jerma i'm sick of arguing about this the cookie sitting in the milk is
[24656.39s -> 24661.67s]  objectively bad it doesn't mix like cereal it just sits in the bottom and gets gross if you drink all
[24661.67s -> 24676.87s]  of the milk it's still there it's of course it's gross um yes it's gross do you know what else is
[24677.75s -> 24686.36s]  mcdonald's i still eat that and i go oh that was pretty good the greasy pizza from
[24687.24s -> 24699.72s]  7-eleven is disgusting but i've eaten it and like all right whatever this is not a bad argument
[24699.72s -> 24706.65s]  they weird gross things they still are it tastes good they're still edible if it's there i'm gonna
[24706.65s -> 24716.10s]  eat it your burgers aren't on the bottom of a glass of milk oh are you sure about that are you sure
[24716.10s -> 24734.98s]  about the preparations of your pristine big mac that you ordered who has any idea it's all the
[24734.98s -> 24742.81s]  same in the stomach somebody somebody gets it sad vega you get it eating is kind of a pain in the
[24742.81s -> 24750.54s]  ass don't you guys ever think that sometimes i'll be like in the middle of something and it's just
[24751.48s -> 24758.60s]  i just i just want to continue to do that thing and you got to take an hour plus sometimes to
[24758.60s -> 24763.48s]  prepare and eat food even if you get fast food it's still it's like a significant portion of
[24763.48s -> 24775.88s]  every single day we probably spend like three to four hours plus eating every day it's like
[24775.88s -> 24784.63s]  that's too much not time it next time the next even okay if you go no no seriously it takes
[24784.63s -> 24791.64s]  about it takes at least two to three hours to eat every meal it's not yeah it depends sometimes
[24791.64s -> 24798.36s]  if you okay if you like buy if you buy food from the grocery store and you make it that it takes
[24798.36s -> 24804.36s]  like 40 to 50 minutes sometimes to make food what if do you do you do you guys make food
[24808.04s -> 24817.21s]  half an hour this ain't rachel ray some of that shit works that's cooking not eating yeah but the
[24817.21s -> 24832.20s]  the act of eating requires the cooking so that's time that's added guys even craft macaroni and
[24832.20s -> 24844.89s]  cheese the orange box shit takes like 25 minutes to make to make it right what do you mean it does
[24846.57s -> 24852.58s]  how long does it take to boil water i think you guys don't understand time management skills
[24853.30s -> 24863.00s]  i play dead rising i know these things it takes like five to ten minutes to even boil a pot of
[24863.00s -> 24876.23s]  water you boil the water you put the macaroni in there let's see craft mac and cheese directions
[24881.85s -> 24886.09s]  you boil you make it doesn't take you three minutes to make craft mac and cheese
[24886.65s -> 24895.38s]  uh-huh bring six cups of water to a boil cook the macaroni for seven to eight minutes drain
[24895.38s -> 24899.14s]  the water from the macaroni that's another 20 30 40 seconds spinning on hot it is
[24900.10s -> 24904.98s]  place macaroni margarine milk and cheese sauce into the saucepan stir it up takes about two or
[24904.98s -> 24913.32s]  three minutes to stir that up and get it ready and then guess what you eat it out of that pot
[24914.04s -> 24924.30s]  so the second that it comes off the stove you go oh oh oh my mouth what you let it sit there for
[24924.30s -> 24930.62s]  like a few minutes so it cools down it takes like fucking 20 fucking it takes like fucking 20 fucking
[24930.62s -> 24939.29s]  minutes mate and then you have to sit there after eating like a whole a whole carton of craft mac
[24939.29s -> 24949.37s]  and cheese and you have to you do like the oh oh you said you did that for about 15 minutes
[24949.37s -> 24955.90s]  before you can even go back to work that's a 30 minute ordeal yeah that's just mac and cheese
[24956.54s -> 24967.21s]  20 minutes equals three hours that's how long it takes to make macaroni and cheese out of the box
[24968.58s -> 24976.82s]  is that what you eat every day three meals a day that's a side you you make others don't just
[24976.82s -> 24992.98s]  eat mac and cheese i hope you don't do that i went to college so did i i know that life
[24993.62s -> 25002.09s]  just eat it raw and don't even get me started if you make us i've got a casserole or something if
[25002.09s -> 25009.03s]  you're baking like a turkey in the oven or like a ham see you in an hour you guys have a slow
[25009.03s -> 25014.81s]  cooked before that shit takes like six to eight hours in a slow cooker am i being really told
[25014.81s -> 25025.24s]  that it doesn't take more than a couple hours to make food for a day an hour for a turkey this
[25025.24s -> 25033.34s]  takes wait it takes like three hours who bakes a turkey every week oh okay that gets me thinking
[25033.34s -> 25037.10s]  that gets me to think about this turn the music off this is actually fucking funny so today
[25038.71s -> 25046.12s]  so today i was uh i was pulling out of my i was pulling out of my spot right and i'm like pulling
[25046.12s -> 25051.48s]  out into the road and i noticed oh there's um just like oh and like in like the neighborhood
[25051.48s -> 25055.88s]  there's like there's like people outside there's like kids playing oh cool okay and like they were
[25055.88s -> 25059.56s]  playing uh like wiffle ball or something these they went probably six years old or something
[25059.56s -> 25064.68s]  right so i'm out there and i see okay everyone like watch out here comes the car everyone gets
[25064.68s -> 25069.96s]  out of the way and i'm like okay everyone's safe and they're the parents were out there and it was
[25069.96s -> 25076.60s]  just like a very quick like oh hello like neighbor kind of thing i was like hey how are you and i go
[25076.60s -> 25085.03s]  playing and they go yep we're playing and i go hey who's winning and they go everyone because it
[25085.03s -> 25091.45s]  was like 10 kids i was like oh hey who's winning and i was thinking to myself like oh i look like
[25091.45s -> 25094.57s]  a fucking asshole like i'm saying like who's winning the game that's what i care about
[25097.61s -> 25100.57s]  and then i just get they were like no everyone's winning haha and i'm like yeah
[25101.53s -> 25106.17s]  yeah that's great that's exactly what it should be and then i kind of was like okay bye and i'm
[25106.17s -> 25110.01s]  sitting the driving away going like i look like a fucking dick that only cares about winning
[25110.01s -> 25115.75s]  to like six-year-olds that's not what i meant though but it's like that's how i looked
[25120.92s -> 25129.26s]  you know i didn't slam the accelerate that's a normal thing to say i don't know i was like
[25129.34s -> 25133.74s]  really thinking about that that does not sound like normal when i think about it like a million
[25133.74s -> 25152.30s]  times in a row who's winning six-year-olds is it normal how does this relate to turkeys
[25152.30s -> 25156.02s]  because somebody said you're eating a turkey every week like what are you some kind of like
[25156.02s -> 25169.45s]  rich asshole hey who's winning turkey done yet like i bake a turkey three times a week
[25169.45s -> 25180.36s]  like i know i don't i don't do any of these things that's that's kind of a stretch well i
[25180.36s -> 25194.76s]  really wanted to tell that story uh seven hours ago what about the kids answer everyone yeah
[25194.76s -> 25200.71s]  that's fine you don't want like a little kid to like be losing what did you want them to do
[25200.71s -> 25209.34s]  be like oh yeah well uh jeffrey uh and caroline they're winning uh stacy's losing right now and
[25209.34s -> 25222.12s]  losing yep oh i thought i was and i was playing that would be bad all right moral the story is
[25223.58s -> 25230.20s]  it takes more than 20 minutes to eat three and cook and prepare and eat three to four meals a day
[25230.20s -> 25233.16s]  and i know some of you guys eating once a day and you're like what are you talking about it takes
[25233.16s -> 25241.54s]  me 10 minutes i eat one giant piece of meat don't do that anymore spread it out you should be eating
[25241.54s -> 25254.62s]  like three four plus meals a day snacks sometimes in the middle smaller portions you could eat the
[25254.62s -> 25264.39s]  same thing but just spread it out put it in the fridge it's really hard i know it's real hard
[25264.47s -> 25269.83s]  because i know exactly what you mean by that because when you buy the steak and cheese sub
[25269.83s -> 25274.54s]  you get the large and it's in front of you and you're hungry and you get through half of the
[25274.54s -> 25283.40s]  large and you're just like i have to eat the rest of this i have to i know that i shouldn't i just
[25283.40s -> 25289.40s]  just put it away and eat it later and have something else no you house the whole thing
[25290.04s -> 25298.47s]  it's like 1800 calories of food and then you're slow for the next four hours and then you don't
[25298.47s -> 25304.42s]  even you're not even hungry for dinner because you acted like a goddamn camel and you eat like
[25304.42s -> 25315.19s]  you ate that one large steak and cheese for breakfast and now you're not even hungry at dinner
[25315.19s -> 25327.45s]  over encumbered yeah i i i still do this and it's bad you shouldn't be doing it the most recent
[25327.45s -> 25331.53s]  science does not support that conclusion and has more than a decade intermittent fasting is the
[25331.53s -> 25341.94s]  healthiest thing you can do one meal a day is actually the best for you please google uh hold
[25341.94s -> 25352.25s]  on a second here one meal a day a huge meal is that's how you like that's how you gain a bunch
[25352.25s -> 25370.98s]  of weight well you're not eating like a 2000 calories and then going to bed right yes as
[25370.98s -> 25381.45s]  long as it's under 2000 calories what one meal a day i'm gonna look this up the one meal a day
[25381.45s -> 25390.50s]  diet is a weight loss plan that requires a person to only eat one meal per day is it safe to eat one
[25390.50s -> 25405.21s]  meal a day this is called okay this is called the oh mad diet the this is called the you mad diet
[25405.21s -> 25415.82s]  what the fuck is this fasting from food for 23 hours a day and eating whatever you want for one
[25415.82s -> 25423.35s]  meal this sounds like a scam you can just eat whatever you want as long as you eat once that
[25423.35s -> 25428.87s]  meal can range from a double cheeseburger and fries to a what the fuck is this is this real
[25429.51s -> 25443.22s]  the you mad diet i tried the extreme fasting oh mad diet here's what happened to me let's see
[25443.22s -> 25453.93s]  what happened you could eat pizza and burgers every day drink beer and still lose weight
[25456.20s -> 25466.26s]  now this is like this i've seen this commercial as long as you eat less than 2000 calories a day
[25466.26s -> 25476.49s]  you can eat whatever you want one but i would don't if you ate 1999 calories in one sitting
[25476.57s -> 25494.78s]  i feel like i would want to fucking puke i feel like i would be so full and i would it would hurt
[25494.78s -> 25499.40s]  what does the science say like a lot of health trends just because people do it doesn't mean
[25499.40s -> 25503.00s]  it's good for you the research is mixed when it comes to whether or not it's safe to eat one meal
[25503.00s -> 25509.83s]  a day one 2007 study connects eating once a day to an increase in blood pressure and cholesterol
[25511.02s -> 25516.46s]  yeah because people were told you can eat anything you want frank oh really and they eat
[25516.46s -> 25535.30s]  fucking four mcdoubles fasting can improve the body's resistance to diseases yeah i know like
[25535.30s -> 25547.53s]  fast but but well i would never be able to do that i did it for a year in college it's just
[25547.53s -> 25554.62s]  calorie counting for idiots people who binge on these diets typically can't maintain
[25554.62s -> 25559.02s]  low calories and eat shitty food if you don't binge and aren't exercising
[25559.58s -> 25569.14s]  you it's fine just take a multivitamin i guess that makes sense because if you eat this one
[25569.14s -> 25575.94s]  meal a day you just have to be like okay uh just eat once and i hope i didn't eat a whole fucking
[25575.94s -> 25593.93s]  pantry worth of food an entire 100 pack of pizza rolls yeah i would get too hungry i don't know if
[25593.93s -> 25600.04s]  fuck me up i feel like i already have like enough problems with like foods and shit i like all of
[25600.04s -> 25609.08s]  the intestinal bullshit if i did this i would probably like i would go into a coma you'd be
[25609.08s -> 25615.46s]  doing it would be like the wake up jeremy in real life what happened well he was eating once a day
[25616.44s -> 25621.08s]  and he was trying he was so desperately trying to get a pizza roll sponsorship so that's all he
[25621.08s -> 25626.26s]  ate he saw supersize me and then thought he could do that with pizza rolls and then maybe get like
[25626.26s -> 25633.61s]  somebody would pay him he actually he actually may have been dead for the last like four days
[25634.25s -> 25643.67s]  i don't know intermittent fasting would probably be good for me yeah but here's the thing about
[25643.67s -> 25651.08s]  fasting for me when i had my colonoscopy you can't eat solid food for three straight days
[25652.50s -> 25664.10s]  that was un fucking bearable that was the worst thing ever even by day one or day two
[25668.14s -> 25675.40s]  no i wouldn't be able to handle it i don't think i'd be able to do it and yeah you'd get used to
[25675.40s -> 25681.83s]  it i don't think i would my brain my brain is so misfires in every direction somebody would open
[25681.83s -> 25687.34s]  a jar of pickles at day one day two and i'd just be like give me those pickles and i'd just start
[25687.34s -> 25697.53s]  eating them and i'd be like i don't care it's over but anyways that's really interesting i
[25698.09s -> 25707.78s]  don't think i could ever do that but let's keep going let's do the uh this thing in fact
[25708.50s -> 25725.34s]  let's switch it on over oh shit do it again hey look at that thanks for all the subs guys
[25726.06s -> 25736.57s]  appreciate it we'll see you tomorrow only a few more bits to do what's doing we got on that
[25736.57s -> 25741.45s]  because somebody talked about the cookie and the milk thing right okay sad vegan thanks to the 500
[25741.45s -> 25745.85s]  bits i'm at a loss for words i seriously expect you to be faster and better that you are killing
[25745.85s -> 25749.93s]  more people this time around when they have a smarter ai you're amazing i truly mean that in a
[25749.93s -> 25758.76s]  good way they die quicker in this game and you have to go further distances in this game they
[25758.84s -> 25776.97s]  die five times faster i don't think the ai is smarter yeah they lose hp much faster
[25778.58s -> 25782.98s]  in the first one somebody could get grabbed and just sit there for a full probably 30 seconds
[25786.31s -> 25789.99s]  they die quicker here than in dead rising 2 i don't know why but off the record is weird is
[25789.99s -> 25802.30s]  that real you need to clear paths and strategize all right well you need you need to like get in
[25802.30s -> 25806.86s]  a fight with the other people that are in this chat that tell me that that's the worst idea
[25808.49s -> 25818.01s]  just you just say you guys should have seen this pre-stream chat it was like people fighting i've
[25818.01s -> 25836.66s]  never seen such division fight fight fight fight constant conflict i still think it's a lot of fun
[25836.66s -> 25857.43s]  no i think it's great if i wasn't having fun i wouldn't play it that simple i love it germa
[25857.43s -> 25862.31s]  also as a pro tip knife and mop got me through a lot of this game early on it's a deadly weapon
[25862.31s -> 25870.47s]  mop have you even seen a mop it's a spear it's the most combat superior weapon known to man
[25870.47s -> 25877.54s]  throughout history now that i agree with yeah we've talked about the spear before it's just a long
[25877.54s -> 25885.90s]  stick that has a knife at the end you can kill somebody before they even come near you how was
[25885.90s -> 25891.96s]  the spear ever fair if you knew that you were going up against spears wouldn't you also bring
