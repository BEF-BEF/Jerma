[1.34s -> 19.98s]  Hey. I'm strapped in. I can't get out now. My arms are tied to the chairs. My back is tied to
[19.98s -> 33.13s]  the back of the chair and I have to beat Sekiro today. No. Welcome guys. He's strapped in all
[33.13s -> 87.34s]  right. I'll be right back. I forgot one thing. A tweet and a coffee. See you in a sec. I got
[87.34s -> 98.12s]  an LOL title. What's wrong with an LOL title every now and then? This is the worst thing.
[98.12s -> 106.07s]  Okay. I'm going to give you some insight on a streamer insight. Okay. So I just had to
[106.07s -> 113.59s]  grab like two things. So I had to go up the stairs. Down the stairs. Auto. You good? Okay.
[113.59s -> 118.15s]  Auto's been up. Back up the stairs. And then I just sat here and I forgot that I'm like,
[119.03s -> 131.26s]  Hey guys, how are you? Hey, welcome to the broadcast. Somebody said, wouldn't you have
[131.26s -> 135.42s]  finished any Dark Souls by now? Dark Souls 3 took me like four or five streams, didn't it?
[136.14s -> 141.77s]  And this game is harder than Dark Souls in my opinion. I think it's more difficult
[142.57s -> 153.38s]  than any of the Dark Souls games. Somebody said, no, you're bad. I beat Owl first try
[153.38s -> 158.39s]  and I beat Double Gorilla first try, but I'm terrible at the game though. You know,
[158.39s -> 162.95s]  just awful. I mean, he's just terrible at this game. Everything about he's terrible at the game.
[163.59s -> 181.24s]  I mean, he's just so bad. I can't even understand how awful he is. The Double Gorilla
[181.24s -> 184.36s]  where you fight two Gorillas at the same time. One of them has that and he beat it first try.
[184.36s -> 188.28s]  I mean, he's so awful at games like this. I just can't, I, I, I can't even watch him.
[194.81s -> 224.33s]  Yeah. I give it a rest. Never. No, I, uh, I just, if you're just joining us for the first
[224.33s -> 229.80s]  time and you haven't seen Sekiro ever, uh, I'm going to tell you just, I'll leave now
[230.44s -> 238.47s]  because we're going to talk about major things that just happened. Okay. Are you here?
[239.03s -> 246.81s]  Are we all good? All right. Uh, so I, that was your chance. I just killed my dad.
[247.69s -> 250.23s]  This is in this room, but literally the last thing I did last night.
[250.79s -> 265.14s]  I don't know what happens next. All I know is that people were in this room, right?
[266.10s -> 280.06s]  Yes. Okay. So I think I got to come down here. I don't have any seeds, right?
[281.42s -> 286.76s]  Shit. Well, I just made a choice to protect him, right?
[303.74s -> 304.70s]  This is the tree branch.
[316.44s -> 326.97s]  Yes. That's right. Yeah. I killed my father for a stick. Yeah. I could have just gone outside
[327.61s -> 331.53s]  to any tree out there. I could have just, okay, I could have like sneezed over here
[331.53s -> 334.97s]  and he was like, what was that? Could have walked over, grabbed a branch from here,
[334.97s -> 339.50s]  just snapped it off and been like heritage. And he would have been like, Oh, thanks.
[341.22s -> 347.21s]  What's so special about that branch? We don't have all the ingredients.
[347.69s -> 349.29s]  That it is the mortal blade.
[353.26s -> 357.58s]  Yes. It was given to me by the divine child of the rejuvenating waters.
[358.30s -> 359.58s]  Do we have all the ingredients?
[362.62s -> 367.74s]  The monks at Sempo temple abandoned the ways of their faith in pursuit of immortality.
[367.74s -> 371.26s]  The result is those who have false dragons heritage
[371.26s -> 374.78s]  known as the divine children of the rejuvenating waters.
[374.78s -> 382.50s]  A false dragon's heritage. I never would have thought. Wait, divine children?
[382.50s -> 387.32s]  Yes. Many were created, but one survived.
[387.32s -> 393.32s]  Further proof of the corruption this power brings to man with the mortal blade in hand.
[393.32s -> 399.32s]  I can now be made to bleed. We are one step closer to creating a fountainhead infant.
[399.32s -> 402.12s]  The ties of immortality must be severed.
[402.12s -> 403.00s]  Yes, my lord.
[404.73s -> 408.26s]  Okay. Well, you didn't really give me any more info.
[408.98s -> 413.38s]  I didn't really look at, let me look at the items too.
[414.50s -> 417.72s]  Cause I got, I got like two new things, right?
[421.34s -> 422.54s]  Didn't I get like something to read?
[423.26s -> 426.79s]  I'm trying to think of what the last thing we did was,
[426.79s -> 428.39s]  or the last piece of information here.
[434.46s -> 437.61s]  What about you? You got anything for me?
[437.61s -> 444.42s]  I'm glad you've come, Master Wolf. It looks as if your brow is less fur.
[444.42s -> 447.30s]  Oh, right, right, right. I was going to kill the tutorial guy.
[448.02s -> 457.88s]  Right. I was going to go kill Mr. Tutorial.
[468.23s -> 477.22s]  I could clear the essence as well. He's ready.
[477.78s -> 487.98s]  You're certain of this?
[487.98s -> 490.95s]  Yes. I want you to kill me.
[490.95s -> 491.99s]  As you wish.
[491.99s -> 497.37s]  Go on.
[497.37s -> 500.01s]  How do I do it? Can I do it any way I want?
[500.57s -> 503.05s]  Like can I get up there and drop a piano on him?
[503.05s -> 511.56s]  Oh no, he has to die by this sword, right?
[511.56s -> 513.56s]  Whoa, there's a centipede inside of him.
[516.70s -> 520.60s]  What? Oh, why the fuck does he have that inside of his body?
[521.32s -> 532.54s]  Oh, false tooth loaded with a secret shinobi drug.
[532.54s -> 534.38s]  Blue in color can be used repeatedly.
[535.74s -> 540.38s]  Crush the blue nostrum between the back teeth to die as often as one pleases.
[543.75s -> 548.87s]  What? All right, I'm just figuring out people that can't die have
[549.59s -> 551.75s]  the centipede worm inside them.
[552.55s -> 555.38s]  That's fucked up.
[556.89s -> 558.33s]  That's a cyanide tooth.
[558.89s -> 560.82s]  That's like some CIA shit.
[564.98s -> 566.50s]  Wait, do I have one of those inside of me?
[568.46s -> 569.26s]  I probably do.
[570.95s -> 572.23s]  Imagine figuring that out.
[573.22s -> 574.74s]  Imagine seeing that.
[574.74s -> 576.66s]  That's what makes people stay alive forever.
[579.69s -> 582.01s]  I would be like, how am I going to get a CT scan?
[582.01s -> 582.81s]  Don't kill me yet.
[582.81s -> 585.61s]  But just like, I just want to know if it's in there.
[592.26s -> 594.18s]  Well, that was, I got the tooth.
[594.18s -> 596.09s]  How much money do I have?
[596.65s -> 597.54s]  360.
[600.20s -> 600.92s]  I can't breathe.
[603.40s -> 606.76s]  All right, I got to, I'm going to cleanse the dragon rut.
[606.76s -> 607.48s]  Let's just do it now.
[621.11s -> 621.99s]  Everyone's been healed.
[627.11s -> 628.15s]  All right, clean slate.
[629.11s -> 629.59s]  Good to go.
[630.79s -> 631.75s]  Hey, I'm fine.
[633.29s -> 640.34s]  Now I want to, I mean, he's got two of these, so I can always have at least one.
[644.76s -> 645.48s]  What about pellets?
[645.48s -> 647.16s]  Maybe I should just buy a shitload of pellets.
[650.01s -> 650.73s]  How many do I have?
[653.16s -> 654.60s]  No, I have 24 of these.
[656.28s -> 657.72s]  When did I get so many pellets?
[660.09s -> 661.53s]  I don't even remember getting this many.
[661.53s -> 663.85s]  When did I get, oh yeah, I did go on like an item run, didn't I?
[668.57s -> 670.17s]  Are you going to try to kill headless today?
[670.17s -> 671.37s]  I don't even want to hear that name.
[672.94s -> 674.70s]  I don't even want to know that character exists.
[675.34s -> 677.10s]  It'll automatically make me upset.
[680.71s -> 682.47s]  In fact, I'm already mad now.
[682.47s -> 683.43s]  I don't even want to think about it.
[685.08s -> 686.04s]  I'm going to say we'll see.
[694.06s -> 694.94s]  I'm just preparing.
[694.94s -> 697.42s]  I'm just getting, make sure I'm ready to play because we got this.
[697.42s -> 701.18s]  We're in like the last, we're in like the final act of the game, I think.
[702.46s -> 705.66s]  From what happened last night, this has to be the final act.
[705.66s -> 713.91s]  I still need, okay, what can I, what can I get?
[714.63s -> 718.87s]  Let me see, sparkling, long spark.
[721.83s -> 725.03s]  Long spark and increased proportion of black eye over the effect can be prolonged
[725.03s -> 725.75s]  in the average fire.
[725.75s -> 728.07s]  I like the firecrackers, purple fumes spark.
[734.14s -> 734.86s]  Oh shit.
[735.94s -> 738.02s]  I want this, I want this so bad.
[740.70s -> 743.18s]  Oh man, I want this, I want this right now.
[743.18s -> 744.62s]  How do I get this right now?
[744.62s -> 749.54s]  That's a lot of money.
[750.26s -> 751.54s]  I'm going to, how much money do I have?
[751.54s -> 752.26s]  Do I have any things?
[752.90s -> 757.58s]  I don't think I have any of those pouches, do I?
[758.22s -> 758.94s]  I do.
[758.94s -> 760.46s]  Yeah, I have to, I'm buying it.
[761.02s -> 764.34s]  What was it, six?
[764.98s -> 770.41s]  I use the firecrackers so much.
[770.41s -> 771.45s]  It's like my favorite item.
[772.01s -> 773.21s]  I might as well just do it.
[773.21s -> 774.25s]  If that's the thing I'm going to use.
[775.21s -> 783.38s]  Because I have the materials to go from here to here.
[789.88s -> 791.24s]  I need two.
[792.68s -> 796.20s]  Okay, let's just start it.
[796.20s -> 797.00s]  What does this one do?
[797.56s -> 801.16s]  Forcing enemies caught in the last turn around.
[801.16s -> 802.84s]  This is the one that makes them turn around.
[802.84s -> 803.88s]  Okay, I can do it twice.
[804.84s -> 809.82s]  And then that leads me to here.
[810.62s -> 815.27s]  Oh my god, dude, do I have to go?
[816.07s -> 819.53s]  Do I have to get this as well?
[820.84s -> 826.07s]  Shit, this really is Monster Hunter.
[826.07s -> 827.19s]  God damn it.
[827.19s -> 828.55s]  I have to get all these?
[829.19s -> 830.39s]  Oh no.
[831.59s -> 833.11s]  All right, well, I have to get this.
[845.56s -> 846.44s]  I need more money.
[853.58s -> 855.34s]  What was it, I didn't see it.
[855.34s -> 857.18s]  I think it was like 500 or 600.
[866.39s -> 867.27s]  Just get more money.
[867.27s -> 868.55s]  Well, at least I'm upgrading these.
[869.27s -> 872.97s]  Okay, then that gives this to me.
[872.97s -> 875.77s]  I need 600 more, which leads to here.
[875.77s -> 879.98s]  This is improve Sabumaru.
[880.78s -> 882.70s]  So let's just get, I have a little bit more money.
[882.70s -> 883.18s]  Let's do it.
[890.57s -> 892.09s]  Two, three, four, five.
[892.09s -> 892.65s]  God damn it.
[893.21s -> 905.64s]  Hold on.
[913.10s -> 914.14s]  Play a different game?
[914.14s -> 915.66s]  No, I have to, come on.
[915.66s -> 916.78s]  Well, you want me to stop now?
[921.42s -> 922.70s]  Imagine stopping now.
[924.15s -> 928.06s]  All right, I'm going to sell like fucking four of these.
[932.81s -> 935.05s]  Imagine playing this game to this point
[935.05s -> 936.33s]  and then being like, well, that was fun.
[936.33s -> 937.85s]  First impressions, it's really hard.
[937.85s -> 938.41s]  It's really good.
[939.96s -> 940.52s]  That's it.
[941.48s -> 942.84s]  I'll see you next time.
[942.84s -> 947.34s]  Okay, so this brings me down here.
[951.50s -> 958.34s]  Okay, that, all right.
[958.34s -> 961.70s]  Okay, I am now ready to go from that in a straight line now.
[963.93s -> 965.21s]  So I have improved stuff.
[970.25s -> 971.85s]  That's what you do with most games you stream.
[971.85s -> 977.61s]  Well, if a game has, I mean, it really depends, right?
[978.41s -> 980.01s]  Okay, like a game like Kenshi, right?
[980.01s -> 982.65s]  That's like a 200 hour game, right?
[982.65s -> 985.37s]  I'm not going to play that like 30 streams in a row.
[986.01s -> 990.09s]  A game like Resident Evil 2, I'll play through the whole thing.
[990.09s -> 991.69s]  It's like a one and done kind of experience.
[992.25s -> 994.57s]  A game like this, it's just all the way through, one and done.
[999.56s -> 1004.12s]  Games that require like potentially 10 to 20 streams
[1004.20s -> 1006.12s]  to even get to the meat and potato of the game.
[1006.84s -> 1011.53s]  It's a lot different.
[1011.53s -> 1013.94s]  Okay, so I have some better stuff.
[1013.94s -> 1014.82s]  Let's see.
[1014.82s -> 1015.62s]  That's already there.
[1016.34s -> 1042.04s]  I think I'm ready to go.
[1043.37s -> 1045.29s]  That was 50 bucks just came in right now.
[1046.01s -> 1048.02s]  Who just gave 50 dollars?
[1049.56s -> 1050.92s]  It was Fitty.
[1050.92s -> 1057.82s]  Thank you so much, Fitty, for the 50 dollars.
[1060.95s -> 1061.75s]  Hey, money.
[1061.75s -> 1062.63s]  They said, also, just so you know,
[1062.63s -> 1064.95s]  your chat's being monitored and recorded 24-7.
[1065.51s -> 1066.74s]  This is the internet.
[1069.16s -> 1071.16s]  If you don't think that everything you've ever typed
[1071.16s -> 1073.24s]  in this chat could be pulled up somewhere.
[1073.32s -> 1074.52s]  We're in 2019, man.
[1074.52s -> 1075.08s]  It's the internet.
[1075.64s -> 1082.90s]  You know what?
[1082.90s -> 1086.34s]  That's just the nature of where we are right now as humans.
[1092.86s -> 1094.38s]  Hey, future people.
[1094.38s -> 1095.90s]  Chat is just learning this.
[1099.19s -> 1101.67s]  Yeah, so when you told me like two weeks ago
[1103.06s -> 1104.74s]  to suck a fart out of your ass,
[1107.10s -> 1108.86s]  somebody can just find you saying that.
[1109.82s -> 1110.86s]  I hope everyone's aware of this.
[1114.30s -> 1115.34s]  Like when you told chat
[1115.34s -> 1117.02s]  that you ate a booger out of your nose
[1117.02s -> 1118.54s]  and you liked how it tasted,
[1118.54s -> 1119.58s]  and you were like, fuck, man.
[1119.58s -> 1121.26s]  It's like weird, but I don't know why I like that.
[1122.30s -> 1125.18s]  Five years from now, someone can look at that.
[1125.18s -> 1134.47s]  It's the internet, man.
[1135.03s -> 1136.07s]  You got to be careful.
[1141.10s -> 1142.70s]  He just admitted it on stream.
[1144.06s -> 1145.34s]  All right, where the fuck am I going?
[1147.22s -> 1149.86s]  I got, okay, I can dive.
[1150.58s -> 1153.69s]  Where do I want to go?
[1153.69s -> 1168.30s]  I've said some pretty dopey stuff, to be honest.
[1169.38s -> 1170.26s]  Yeah, whatever, though.
[1172.14s -> 1175.74s]  It was like, your future employer
[1175.74s -> 1177.34s]  going to go to your Twitch chat log
[1177.34s -> 1178.14s]  and see what you wrote.
[1179.19s -> 1185.27s]  It says here that, was your username ShitEater106?
[1188.60s -> 1188.92s]  Yeah.
[1190.62s -> 1193.82s]  But what about this one that's ShitEater107?
[1193.82s -> 1195.90s]  108, 109, and 110.
[1195.90s -> 1198.06s]  Those are all tied to the same IP address.
[1198.06s -> 1200.30s]  Is that also you?
[1200.30s -> 1202.23s]  Yep, it is.
[1202.23s -> 1206.49s]  Oh, any reason why you made five ShitEater usernames?
[1206.49s -> 1208.09s]  I'm just curious.
[1208.17s -> 1211.05s]  Well, you see, when I was 18,
[1212.07s -> 1214.23s]  I was in this guy, Jerma985's chat,
[1214.23s -> 1216.57s]  and I got banned four times
[1216.57s -> 1220.25s]  for writing I love eating shit in his chat.
[1220.25s -> 1222.25s]  And I got banned four times
[1222.25s -> 1224.89s]  over the course of six months.
[1224.89s -> 1227.93s]  So I just kept making new usernames
[1227.93s -> 1229.30s]  to say that again.
[1229.30s -> 1231.38s]  And I would get removed again.
[1231.38s -> 1232.34s]  And then finally, I was removed
[1232.34s -> 1233.46s]  from the whole website.
[1233.46s -> 1237.86s]  And, excuse me, what?
[1238.86s -> 1242.54s]  I don't think we at Johnson & Johnson
[1242.54s -> 1244.14s]  can have somebody like that around here.
[1244.14s -> 1245.10s]  You have to be careful, guys.
[1259.05s -> 1260.81s]  We here at Johnson & Johnson
[1260.81s -> 1266.47s]  baby tier free shampoo formula company 107,
[1266.47s -> 1270.23s]  105 through, 100 through 106 got banned
[1270.79s -> 1272.15s]  because we were putting formaldehyde
[1272.15s -> 1273.11s]  in baby shampoo.
[1273.11s -> 1275.35s]  We got banned five times as a company.
[1275.35s -> 1283.74s]  Let's go.
[1293.27s -> 1294.79s]  You know too much.
[1298.62s -> 1299.10s]  Yes.
[1299.10s -> 1300.70s]  What am I just like fucking started
[1300.70s -> 1301.66s]  to slash it up?
[1305.35s -> 1306.23s]  Use your eyes.
[1306.23s -> 1307.03s]  Is that what he just said?
[1315.10s -> 1315.98s]  Use your eyes.
[1315.98s -> 1318.57s]  Is the wound I just made
[1318.57s -> 1321.85s]  a small cut on my chest.
[1321.85s -> 1326.98s]  So this an infant.
[1326.98s -> 1331.26s]  It's so extraordinarily nostalgic.
[1332.22s -> 1332.38s]  Yeah.
[1332.38s -> 1333.98s]  Like the new Ghostbusters movie,
[1333.98s -> 1335.18s]  Ghostbusters 3 coming up.
[1341.67s -> 1349.70s]  Okay.
[1354.95s -> 1357.67s]  A sweetly scented bridal offering
[1357.67s -> 1359.11s]  that was written on the altar
[1359.11s -> 1361.27s]  where the fragrant stone was placed.
[1361.27s -> 1361.59s]  Yes.
[1362.31s -> 1363.99s]  You now carry the aroma
[1363.99s -> 1366.07s]  of the Fountainhead incense.
[1366.07s -> 1367.83s]  I believe the path leading
[1367.83s -> 1369.35s]  to the Fountainhead palace
[1369.35s -> 1370.95s]  will open before you.
[1370.95s -> 1373.43s]  If you go to the shrine within the cave,
[1373.43s -> 1375.59s]  immortality shall soon be severed.
[1376.23s -> 1377.35s]  A shrine and cave.
[1377.99s -> 1378.63s]  As you wish.
[1380.07s -> 1382.23s]  So the shrine, where was that?
[1383.11s -> 1388.23s]  Am I drinking?
[1388.23s -> 1390.42s]  No, I got a coffee here.
[1392.30s -> 1392.70s]  All right.
[1392.70s -> 1396.55s]  So that was, which one?
[1396.55s -> 1397.43s]  I see a cave.
[1397.43s -> 1397.91s]  What was it?
[1397.91s -> 1398.79s]  Cave.
[1398.79s -> 1400.39s]  I forget where it was.
[1400.39s -> 1401.59s]  Was that the misty place?
[1402.55s -> 1413.38s]  That was here somewhere.
[1413.38s -> 1414.34s]  Wedding cave door.
[1416.41s -> 1416.81s]  I think.
[1417.45s -> 1425.69s]  Somebody wrote egg.
[1427.38s -> 1429.46s]  Mod that guy for like 30 seconds.
[1435.45s -> 1435.77s]  All right.
[1435.77s -> 1437.69s]  I think this is obviously the place.
[1440.50s -> 1441.70s]  So go in this cave.
[1441.70s -> 1442.98s]  And now I smell like
[1443.78s -> 1445.29s]  I have a certain scent to me.
[1445.29s -> 1446.33s]  So now I'll be able to
[1448.09s -> 1449.37s]  open the secret door.
[1453.78s -> 1454.42s]  Maybe.
[1454.42s -> 1454.74s]  No.
[1456.92s -> 1457.72s]  Shelter stones.
[1457.72s -> 1458.76s]  Is this okay?
[1459.56s -> 1463.82s]  Do I have to get on this?
[1464.46s -> 1472.30s]  Or do I maybe dive?
[1472.30s -> 1473.42s]  Well, no.
[1473.42s -> 1476.14s]  This is, this is just a prayer outhouse.
[1478.52s -> 1478.92s]  Well, hold on.
[1478.92s -> 1480.12s]  Let me dive down here.
[1480.12s -> 1480.68s]  Is there enough?
[1485.69s -> 1486.97s]  Is there a pool I can dive in?
[1487.53s -> 1489.64s]  Is there?
[1489.64s -> 1490.28s]  There has to be.
[1490.28s -> 1490.68s]  Come on.
[1490.68s -> 1492.36s]  This is like a standing water somewhere.
[1495.53s -> 1495.77s]  Yeah.
[1495.77s -> 1496.49s]  Diving in puddles.
[1496.49s -> 1497.37s]  If I dive in a puddle,
[1497.37s -> 1498.57s]  I'll just break my teeth.
[1499.29s -> 1504.82s]  No, there's no pool here.
[1505.72s -> 1506.84s]  I thought maybe there'd be like
[1506.84s -> 1508.20s]  a little pool back here or something.
[1508.20s -> 1508.36s]  All right.
[1508.36s -> 1508.76s]  Let's go.
[1509.56s -> 1512.79s]  Somebody said small break.
[1512.79s -> 1513.83s]  I'm going to go in here.
[1518.34s -> 1518.74s]  God.
[1519.67s -> 1520.63s]  The impatience.
[1524.86s -> 1526.46s]  The instant gratification.
[1526.46s -> 1527.58s]  Instant gratification.
[1528.66s -> 1530.18s]  I want to look around the trees.
[1531.08s -> 1531.40s]  Okay.
[1534.14s -> 1535.66s]  Has it been a giant goat foot?
[1543.02s -> 1544.94s]  It's not somebody's playing the claw game.
[1547.27s -> 1547.91s]  I got it.
[1558.23s -> 1559.03s]  Okay.
[1559.03s -> 1560.07s]  This just got weird.
[1560.71s -> 1565.03s]  That's Mojo from Chrono Cross.
[1568.06s -> 1569.18s]  Odd reference, I know.
[1569.18s -> 1569.66s]  But it is.
[1570.46s -> 1589.24s]  Where is he delivering me to?
[1590.28s -> 1595.56s]  Uh, well, apparently he hasn't walked in a while.
[1596.36s -> 1599.40s]  I severely overestimated.
[1599.40s -> 1601.32s]  I was lying down for too long.
[1601.32s -> 1603.00s]  I have some sort of lactic acid built up.
[1603.00s -> 1604.04s]  I'll just let him go here.
[1604.04s -> 1605.08s]  That's just, this is fine.
[1605.72s -> 1610.46s]  He ended with a dab.
[1610.46s -> 1611.34s]  Oh, don't say that.
[1618.47s -> 1619.67s]  Your uber is here.
[1624.38s -> 1627.16s]  Oh, you guys.
[1627.16s -> 1628.04s]  Whoa, this is cool.
[1628.84s -> 1639.93s]  I kind of would have liked to have
[1639.93s -> 1642.09s]  traveled a little bit longer on Mr.
[1643.48s -> 1648.14s]  Siercaro, just in case.
[1657.06s -> 1658.02s]  That was fun.
[1658.02s -> 1662.14s]  That's the coolest thing in the game so far.
[1662.14s -> 1663.82s]  I hope he gets up when he's, I have to fight him.
[1663.82s -> 1664.86s]  Please let me fight this guy.
[1671.64s -> 1672.28s]  Hey, what was it?
[1672.28s -> 1674.12s]  Well, we ended last night at an 8.6.
[1675.05s -> 1676.33s]  This makes it an 8.7.
[1678.12s -> 1678.76s]  Not that much.
[1678.76s -> 1680.12s]  I only, it was like 15 seconds.
[1694.10s -> 1695.22s]  He's pretending he just moved.
[1697.11s -> 1697.75s]  This is pretty.
[1698.55s -> 1699.19s]  Wait, items.
[1701.22s -> 1702.42s]  From Software always does this thing
[1702.42s -> 1705.16s]  where they put an item directly to the left
[1705.16s -> 1706.76s]  or directly to the right behind something.
[1711.99s -> 1712.95s]  Like back here.
[1712.95s -> 1714.55s]  Oh, come on, there would be one right here.
[1714.55s -> 1716.39s]  If this was any other game, it would be right here.
[1717.11s -> 1720.42s]  You know I'm right.
[1720.42s -> 1720.74s]  All right.
[1720.74s -> 1723.22s]  Well, whatever.
[1723.22s -> 1724.90s]  Theory immediately debunked.
[1724.90s -> 1725.30s]  It's fine.
[1732.90s -> 1733.88s]  Didn't I fight this guy?
[1733.88s -> 1735.80s]  I fought like the illusion version of this guy.
[1739.16s -> 1741.72s]  Okay, I guess we're doing this.
[1743.18s -> 1745.34s]  Damn, that posture damage is fucking terrible.
[1746.06s -> 1747.66s]  Oops.
[1750.34s -> 1757.90s]  Oh, fuck, I thought he didn't know
[1757.90s -> 1758.54s]  he was going to keep going.
[1759.90s -> 1763.16s]  He's got three health bars.
[1771.02s -> 1772.06s]  Whoa, that hurts.
[1773.02s -> 1785.11s]  I'm not fucking with that.
[1787.10s -> 1800.28s]  Oh, no, no, no.
[1801.32s -> 1808.63s]  Damn it, I'm getting too greedy.
[1810.54s -> 1815.82s]  What's he going to do now?
[1819.40s -> 1820.04s]  Different, same.
[1820.68s -> 1821.48s]  All right, this is different.
[1824.76s -> 1826.44s]  I think I'm just going to jump up here.
[1827.40s -> 1828.44s]  Whoa, he can go up.
[1828.44s -> 1829.32s]  What the fuck?
[1830.60s -> 1830.92s]  What?
[1832.20s -> 1834.28s]  He has an extra long sword now.
[1835.00s -> 1836.44s]  Okay, maybe not a good idea.
[1837.24s -> 1860.31s]  Wowee.
[1861.51s -> 1867.45s]  Back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up.
[1867.45s -> 1868.33s]  Back, back, back, back, back.
[1869.29s -> 1870.49s]  Fuck, I didn't time it right.
[1871.45s -> 1884.06s]  All right, let's go, let's go.
[1884.86s -> 1888.90s]  I think I figured, I think I know what he's going to do.
[1889.62s -> 1891.93s]  Uh-oh, here comes a centipede.
[1892.65s -> 1895.00s]  Is he going to do the mist again?
[1895.64s -> 1904.46s]  Whoa, that didn't work.
[1904.86s -> 1905.26s]  Whoa.
[1906.06s -> 1907.50s]  Okay, all right, all right, all right.
[1907.50s -> 1908.14s]  Slow it down.
[1908.94s -> 1913.05s]  Whoa.
[1915.21s -> 1918.14s]  He does, it's all slides.
[1918.94s -> 1921.18s]  I got to get the fuck away from him.
[1925.16s -> 1926.36s]  It's, it's slashes.
[1927.08s -> 1928.25s]  Let's go.
[1928.73s -> 1935.91s]  That's a grab.
[1935.91s -> 1936.47s]  No, it's not.
[1936.47s -> 1937.11s]  Is it terror?
[1938.70s -> 1940.30s]  I have no fucking idea what that is.
[1942.02s -> 1942.50s]  Curious.
[1943.14s -> 1944.10s]  That's terror, isn't it?
[1944.82s -> 1949.32s]  He's curious.
[1959.96s -> 1960.36s]  Faster.
[1960.92s -> 1971.85s]  It's not even worth blocking these because it takes too much.
[1971.85s -> 1972.65s]  Whoop, that's far.
[1973.61s -> 1976.66s]  Didn't jump fast enough.
[1977.94s -> 1981.59s]  You know what?
[1981.59s -> 1983.35s]  Posture candy, I think, is what I got to use here.
[1994.76s -> 1995.08s]  Damn it.
[1995.72s -> 1996.28s]  That was quick.
[1997.32s -> 2003.19s]  I ain't giving up yet.
[2003.19s -> 2003.91s]  I ain't giving up yet.
[2003.91s -> 2004.31s]  Hold on.
[2009.10s -> 2009.90s]  So what's this?
[2009.90s -> 2011.98s]  Posture bites, I need, I need posture candy.
[2020.70s -> 2021.02s]  Shit.
[2024.50s -> 2024.98s]  Not good.
[2025.54s -> 2043.94s]  Back it up, back it up.
[2125.10s -> 2128.86s]  Don't you forget about me.
[2130.71s -> 2136.79s]  That's, that's the wrong thing equipped.
[2136.79s -> 2139.19s]  That's the wrong thing.
[2139.99s -> 2141.27s]  Wrong thing.
[2142.23s -> 2195.38s]  Berry bush, berry bush, berry bush, berry bush, berry bush.
[2210.47s -> 2212.31s]  Oh, it's okay.
[2212.31s -> 2212.95s]  It's okay.
[2214.39s -> 2214.79s]  Fire.
[2217.83s -> 2218.23s]  Fire.
[2219.19s -> 2221.16s]  I bring you fire.
[2222.04s -> 2247.85s]  I am the god of hell fire and I bring you fire.
[2247.85s -> 2260.04s]  I'm telling you, I got locked in the wall there.
[2260.04s -> 2261.88s]  That was very bad.
[2261.88s -> 2273.45s]  That was so scary.
[2273.45s -> 2277.03s]  Without that, without the firecrackers, I'm dead.
[2277.03s -> 2279.88s]  That was a last-ditch effort to cracker them.
[2281.24s -> 2291.72s]  Dragon's tally board.
[2291.72s -> 2295.43s]  That's an iced coffee, huh?
[2295.43s -> 2303.00s]  Possessing this increased the stocks that can be purchased in merchant shops.
[2303.38s -> 2305.78s]  Such a tally board is highly prized by the merchant class.
[2306.50s -> 2310.66s]  Old custom dictates that those of dragon rank are recognized as supreme merchants
[2311.46s -> 2313.08s]  by the imperial palace.
[2314.41s -> 2316.31s]  So what does that mean?
[2319.14s -> 2320.74s]  That means that I can buy more?
[2320.74s -> 2322.18s]  They just have increased stock, I guess.
[2323.38s -> 2323.86s]  Interesting.
[2324.58s -> 2330.57s]  That was a fun fight.
[2333.30s -> 2338.58s]  The last three, they've done like, the last three fights have just been awesome.
[2339.14s -> 2342.81s]  Let's get that power up.
[2344.26s -> 2345.14s]  True monk.
[2350.36s -> 2350.84s]  Uh-huh.
[2350.84s -> 2353.24s]  The corrupted monk was among the infested.
[2353.24s -> 2355.00s]  Standing over the fountainhead palace,
[2355.00s -> 2360.04s]  indeed, immortality would seem a fitting quality for eternal watcher of the palace.
[2360.84s -> 2362.84s]  Her true name is Priestess Yao.
[2366.39s -> 2367.83s]  He hated the guardian ape.
[2368.70s -> 2370.22s]  No, guardian ape was fucking cool.
[2371.10s -> 2378.70s]  It was just, that secret second boss fight was just fucking hard as shit.
[2379.26s -> 2383.06s]  Okay, attack power's been enhanced.
[2385.43s -> 2386.95s]  So I have a please backseat me.
[2387.59s -> 2389.91s]  This is a please backseat me chat, okay?
[2392.34s -> 2392.98s]  What do these do?
[2393.93s -> 2395.45s]  I feel like I've been holding on to both of these.
[2399.42s -> 2403.99s]  I mean, raise in prayer between one's palms to restore a node of res-
[2403.99s -> 2405.43s]  Do I get to only just do this once?
[2406.07s -> 2411.54s]  It just refills a resurrection node.
[2412.18s -> 2415.78s]  So it doesn't add another resurrection, it just refills one.
[2420.06s -> 2420.94s]  Does it consume it?
[2421.50s -> 2422.94s]  If I do this, that's it.
[2422.94s -> 2423.98s]  I just get to do it once.
[2424.95s -> 2425.43s]  One use.
[2427.27s -> 2429.83s]  So let's say I was having like an intense boss fight and I died,
[2429.83s -> 2432.87s]  and I had the black bar down there, and I took one of those.
[2433.43s -> 2434.87s]  I would be able to do it again.
[2434.87s -> 2440.62s]  You could do that, yes.
[2441.82s -> 2442.62s]  Exactly, yes.
[2443.42s -> 2444.14s]  I don't think so.
[2448.42s -> 2449.30s]  I love that.
[2449.30s -> 2450.90s]  You can use it after your res, all right.
[2457.96s -> 2458.60s]  Let's rest.
[2459.24s -> 2461.72s]  Dude, I- it was like two or three part-
[2463.74s -> 2465.90s]  When I had the poison equipped wrong,
[2465.90s -> 2467.66s]  and I thought that was gonna throw me off, that was gonna-
[2467.66s -> 2468.30s]  This is beautiful.
[2468.86s -> 2472.25s]  Fountainhead Palace.
[2478.01s -> 2478.33s]  Points.
[2482.92s -> 2484.20s]  All right, I've hit five.
[2487.82s -> 2488.86s]  I have that skill.
[2489.66s -> 2491.62s]  I've neglected this so much.
[2492.26s -> 2495.05s]  I just don't know where to go.
[2495.93s -> 2498.74s]  This is gonna increase it by one.
[2498.74s -> 2499.54s]  I don't think it's worth it.
[2505.64s -> 2506.44s]  Maybe one of these.
[2507.00s -> 2507.64s]  What do these do?
[2507.64s -> 2508.44s]  Shouldn't it be eyes?
[2510.82s -> 2514.68s]  Ooh, I'm fairly good at countering those.
[2515.32s -> 2524.10s]  I'd do the Makiri counter like six out of ten times.
[2528.63s -> 2529.67s]  Yeah, I'm gonna get this.
[2537.08s -> 2538.44s]  So now I have run and slide.
[2542.15s -> 2544.82s]  And, oh, I gotta get this one too.
[2545.78s -> 2546.98s]  No, wait, what?
[2551.64s -> 2552.84s]  I do have to get this, do I?
[2553.40s -> 2554.54s]  I guess so.
[2556.74s -> 2563.03s]  KDKD945, thanks for the five community subs.
[2563.03s -> 2567.14s]  Thank you so much for the five subs.
[2568.15s -> 2569.35s]  So, look at how close I am.
[2569.35s -> 2570.71s]  I just gotta kill like a couple people.
[2576.26s -> 2577.38s]  Damn, all right.
[2577.38s -> 2577.86s]  I'm ready.
[2577.86s -> 2579.54s]  I told you I was gonna come ready to play today.
[2580.18s -> 2581.35s]  I told you that.
[2581.35s -> 2584.55s]  Last night, owl gone in a fucking try.
[2584.55s -> 2585.59s]  Today, let's go.
[2585.59s -> 2586.31s]  I'm ready to game.
[2586.87s -> 2597.00s]  I've got my caramel macchiato from Starbucks.
[2597.00s -> 2597.56s]  It sucks.
[2598.12s -> 2600.68s]  It's really not that good, but I still have it.
[2601.40s -> 2609.27s]  This thing too.
[2612.63s -> 2615.11s]  Another five community subs from KDK.
[2616.70s -> 2621.00s]  Damn, five more subs from KDK.
[2621.00s -> 2621.40s]  Thank you.
[2622.12s -> 2624.01s]  All right, let's go.
[2624.01s -> 2624.41s]  Let's go.
[2624.41s -> 2624.89s]  Let's game.
[2628.22s -> 2629.26s]  So let's head out here.
[2630.79s -> 2631.75s]  Wait, one last thing.
[2632.39s -> 2635.98s]  Which one of these is the best?
[2636.54s -> 2640.90s]  What's the puppeteer one?
[2643.96s -> 2645.24s]  Maybe this one sounds interesting.
[2650.46s -> 2650.78s]  All right.
[2653.45s -> 2657.10s]  I don't know if anybody else gets like this
[2657.10s -> 2657.98s]  when they play these games,
[2658.70s -> 2662.70s]  but after like an intense fight that you win,
[2665.46s -> 2667.14s]  I don't know why this doesn't happen when you lose.
[2667.78s -> 2670.50s]  Maybe it's because your body doesn't have any time to relax,
[2671.69s -> 2673.93s]  but after killing that guy,
[2674.57s -> 2676.17s]  I was like this.
[2676.17s -> 2681.45s]  Like, and I need a second to just fucking relax.
[2682.41s -> 2682.73s]  Okay.
[2683.45s -> 2685.38s]  It doesn't happen when I lose.
[2687.77s -> 2690.09s]  I think it's your body just unwinding
[2690.89s -> 2692.97s]  because you still wound up the whole time.
[2692.97s -> 2698.15s]  I just gotta look at this.
[2698.71s -> 2700.60s]  Where's the selfie camera?
[2700.60s -> 2701.48s]  Just take a pic.
[2701.48s -> 2704.28s]  Take a note from the spider man.
[2704.28s -> 2705.08s]  Whatever.
[2705.08s -> 2707.51s]  I'm too busy looking.
[2707.51s -> 2708.31s]  This is beautiful.
[2708.31s -> 2709.11s]  This is the part that I like.
[2709.11s -> 2710.79s]  This is my favorite zone so far.
[2710.79s -> 2716.97s]  I could get hurt by falling here.
[2716.97s -> 2722.47s]  Oh, I guess we didn't even hurt.
[2730.90s -> 2732.10s]  Yeah, this is lovely.
[2732.82s -> 2744.87s]  Let me see.
[2753.66s -> 2754.16s]  Ooh.
[2756.14s -> 2761.02s]  KDK again is on like a five sub every 30 second interval.
[2762.54s -> 2767.91s]  Thank you KDK again for the five community subs.
[2767.91s -> 2768.71s]  That's...
[2768.71s -> 2771.78s]  Is that a dog?
[2773.78s -> 2774.82s]  No, it's got like a...
[2774.82s -> 2777.22s]  No, it's one of those weird alien people.
[2797.00s -> 2797.88s]  He's my friend.
[2799.61s -> 2800.49s]  See, I didn't kill him.
[2800.49s -> 2804.92s]  I just brought him back as a close friend of mine.
[2804.92s -> 2805.56s]  What do you want to do?
[2806.52s -> 2807.85s]  I don't know.
[2807.85s -> 2808.65s]  Finally, have a go...
[2808.65s -> 2809.69s]  Okay, you can co-op now.
[2810.17s -> 2812.49s]  This is how you do co-op in Sekiro.
[2813.13s -> 2815.24s]  You have to control their minds.
[2815.24s -> 2816.04s]  KDK again.
[2819.14s -> 2820.18s]  KDK added again.
[2823.83s -> 2824.47s]  Yeah, okay.
[2824.47s -> 2826.15s]  Those of you that are concerned about co-op,
[2826.15s -> 2827.27s]  just get this ability
[2828.07s -> 2829.51s]  and then pretend that your friend's over.
[2838.78s -> 2839.98s]  Oh, god damn it, dude.
[2839.98s -> 2840.62s]  Really?
[2840.62s -> 2842.22s]  You got hit by the fucking arrow there.
[2842.22s -> 2844.22s]  Now we have to go back to the beginning.
[2844.22s -> 2845.50s]  I have to reload the game.
[2847.37s -> 2848.49s]  Just try not to die.
[2849.13s -> 2853.75s]  From Software is like the worst making co-op parts of video games.
[2854.31s -> 2858.10s]  Let me go back and put my soapstone down again.
[2858.10s -> 2858.74s]  God damn it.
[2868.10s -> 2869.54s]  I didn't even know what that was.
[2869.54s -> 2870.66s]  I don't know what happened.
[2870.66s -> 2871.54s]  Fucking god damn it.
[2871.54s -> 2873.70s]  Yeah, I'll see you in 22 more minutes.
[2881.62s -> 2883.14s]  My game just had crashed.
[2883.14s -> 2894.26s]  I'm a funny streamer.
[2895.22s -> 2895.78s]  Thanks.
[2897.32s -> 2897.96s]  I tried.
[2898.60s -> 2900.76s]  We do like jokes and comedy here.
[2900.76s -> 2901.80s]  I'll give you a routine.
[2901.80s -> 2902.04s]  Ready?
[2902.04s -> 2903.16s]  Like, hey, it's me.
[2904.20s -> 2905.96s]  Playing on the drum.
[2905.96s -> 2906.84s]  Not anymore.
[2906.84s -> 2907.24s]  Got you.
[2907.24s -> 2909.88s]  Oh, my livelihood.
[2911.08s -> 2920.17s]  Another five subs from KDK.
[2920.17s -> 2921.61s]  Are you going to do this like the whole time?
[2922.65s -> 2924.33s]  Five more subs from KDK.
[2928.87s -> 2931.35s]  This is just going to keep going.
[2931.35s -> 2932.47s]  This guy's 43.
[2932.47s -> 2933.19s]  Not even close.
[2933.83s -> 2937.77s]  I kind of just want to look around.
[2937.77s -> 2938.41s]  I like this place.
[2944.14s -> 2944.94s]  He's 60.
[2944.94s -> 2947.50s]  I sound 60 at the moment.
[2953.53s -> 2955.83s]  Well, there's a guy over here.
[2958.20s -> 2959.72s]  This place is huge.
[2959.72s -> 2963.59s]  Ooh, all right.
[2964.63s -> 2968.68s]  Oh, these are the treasurers.
[2968.68s -> 2969.88s]  These are the treasurers.
[2969.96s -> 2973.96s]  Um, somebody just threw a toaster in here.
[2973.96s -> 2974.76s]  How do I get out of here?
[2975.80s -> 2982.60s]  It's okay.
[2982.60s -> 2985.67s]  This get out of the water.
[2985.67s -> 2986.47s]  Get out of the water.
[2989.00s -> 2990.28s]  That guy has lightning.
[2990.28s -> 2991.08s]  I told you.
[2991.72s -> 2993.40s]  Do you guys remember when I played Hitman?
[2994.34s -> 2995.78s]  And I made the reference.
[2995.78s -> 2998.90s]  I threw like a fucking piece of electrical equipment into the ocean.
[3001.14s -> 3005.30s]  And everyone laughed at me because I said I was going to electrocute everybody
[3005.30s -> 3006.98s]  that was currently in the Atlantic Ocean.
[3009.21s -> 3011.29s]  You tell me that I'm I'm I'm bullshit now.
[3016.49s -> 3021.21s]  That guy just threw a little bit of electricity in a gigantic lake and killed me.
[3024.06s -> 3025.02s]  That wouldn't happen with that.
[3025.02s -> 3027.02s]  Okay, seriously myth busters.
[3028.87s -> 3032.71s]  If I was in a, um, if I was in a lake this big
[3033.86s -> 3037.30s]  and somebody just put an electrical current into the water, what would happen?
[3037.86s -> 3039.14s]  Would I be fine?
[3042.41s -> 3044.49s]  No, nothing.
[3048.22s -> 3049.34s]  Okay, how small?
[3049.34s -> 3051.34s]  Okay, what myth buster level?
[3052.06s -> 3056.14s]  How small would the body of water have to be if you put like 10,000 watts
[3056.14s -> 3056.78s]  into the water?
[3059.78s -> 3062.70s]  Are we talking like a large swimming pool?
[3062.70s -> 3064.46s]  A bathtub?
[3069.93s -> 3071.21s]  A kiddie pool?
[3073.98s -> 3075.18s]  Let's go with lightning.
[3075.18s -> 3076.86s]  KDK just gave 10 more subs.
[3080.49s -> 3083.45s]  The electrodes would dissipate after 20 feet.
[3083.45s -> 3083.77s]  What?
[3083.77s -> 3088.38s]  Okay, so if I was in like a swimming pool
[3088.38s -> 3092.54s]  and you threw like a supercharged toaster into the swimming pool plugged in,
[3092.54s -> 3093.10s]  I'd be fine.
[3093.82s -> 3095.69s]  Are we sure?
[3095.69s -> 3107.58s]  Or maybe let's test it.
[3108.70s -> 3111.86s]  No, I just don't know.
[3111.86s -> 3112.82s]  Like I'm curious.
[3113.62s -> 3115.94s]  Okay, if like if you, that's why they say get out of the water.
[3115.94s -> 3117.78s]  If like there's a thunderstorm, right?
[3119.42s -> 3123.10s]  I remember when I was a kid, when I was like fucking 10, I had a pool
[3123.82s -> 3125.98s]  and it was always like the second that you'd hear like
[3128.14s -> 3130.86s]  my father would fucking rip open the sliding door.
[3132.14s -> 3134.30s]  Everybody get the fuck out of the pool right now.
[3135.64s -> 3136.76s]  Dad, what are you talking about?
[3137.56s -> 3139.96s]  He was like reaching and like trying to grab us like get out.
[3140.60s -> 3146.30s]  If lightning struck inside the pool.
[3152.12s -> 3156.82s]  I'm going to move on from this conversation because it's fucking stupid.
[3156.82s -> 3160.50s]  Okay, if lightning struck the Atlantic Ocean while there are people swimming.
[3163.98s -> 3165.02s]  Okay, I'm done.
[3165.02s -> 3165.98s]  I have to concentrate.
[3175.48s -> 3179.48s]  KDK, KDK, I think you have like, I think you're on auto by.
[3182.86s -> 3184.38s]  Ow, ow, ow.
[3184.38s -> 3185.58s]  No, not into the lightning water.
[3186.14s -> 3186.86s]  What, no.
[3186.86s -> 3189.50s]  Oh, where's my heel?
[3189.50s -> 3191.42s]  What the fuck is happening with my heel?
[3201.06s -> 3206.41s]  All right, I took, I took it off the bar because I was in the middle of heated,
[3206.97s -> 3208.57s]  heated exchange.
[3208.57s -> 3214.50s]  Okay, all right.
[3214.50s -> 3215.94s]  Hey, look at how beautiful this is.
[3215.94s -> 3216.42s]  Remember this?
[3221.53s -> 3222.09s]  Thank God.
[3226.58s -> 3227.22s]  All right, let's go.
[3227.78s -> 3229.05s]  I don't need to go in the house.
[3231.22s -> 3234.14s]  I need to go on top of the house though,
[3234.14s -> 3236.14s]  because that's where these guys are throwing shit at me from.
[3236.78s -> 3240.38s]  Why would there be stealth grass here?
[3241.02s -> 3247.22s]  I don't think I've ever aggroed one of these guys.
[3247.94s -> 3253.05s]  He's just like, snorting.
[3253.05s -> 3253.61s]  What is that?
[3261.56s -> 3262.20s]  The magic?
[3264.18s -> 3266.02s]  He's just throwing punches at nothing.
[3266.98s -> 3273.45s]  I don't know what that thing is.
[3275.19s -> 3277.03s]  What bar, okay, what is he doing from me?
[3277.03s -> 3278.39s]  Is he sucking souls from me?
[3279.91s -> 3285.08s]  All right, let's go back and kick this guy's ass.
[3286.12s -> 3288.04s]  Do they guys just have 200 fucking dollars?
[3288.76s -> 3291.85s]  Am I reading that right?
[3292.41s -> 3299.34s]  Why don't I just grind these guys?
[3300.06s -> 3308.97s]  Okay, let's go around here, get the guy up top.
[3320.73s -> 3321.21s]  Ahem.
[3321.21s -> 3323.21s]  But KDK, you've given so many subs.
[3323.21s -> 3323.93s]  Thank you so much.
[3331.48s -> 3332.12s]  Oops.
[3332.12s -> 3333.64s]  Well, it's okay.
[3333.64s -> 3334.92s]  Will he shoot arrows for me?
[3341.11s -> 3341.59s]  Go get him.
[3344.18s -> 3345.38s]  Will we go get him?
[3350.34s -> 3352.02s]  Go, go do something.
[3353.96s -> 3355.24s]  They're both just looking at each other.
[3355.24s -> 3356.12s]  What is that guy doing?
[3369.11s -> 3370.79s]  All right, well, there goes that one.
[3372.89s -> 3374.57s]  I just have this one more somewhere.
[3378.81s -> 3381.19s]  Check for items.
[3381.19s -> 3382.31s]  Holy shit, okay.
[3383.82s -> 3394.38s]  Well, you know what?
[3394.38s -> 3397.18s]  Okay, I'll tell you one gripe that I have with the game.
[3397.18s -> 3397.98s]  Are you ready?
[3397.98s -> 3398.70s]  Are you ready for it?
[3398.70s -> 3399.82s]  Not a complaint, a gripe.
[3399.82s -> 3400.78s]  It's different.
[3400.78s -> 3402.14s]  So I'm in stealth right now, right?
[3402.70s -> 3403.50s]  I'm in sneak mode.
[3403.50s -> 3403.90s]  Here we go.
[3403.90s -> 3405.34s]  I'm going to backstab you.
[3405.34s -> 3406.46s]  Okay, I can't do it now.
[3409.00s -> 3411.16s]  All right, what I was going to say was that was bad.
[3411.80s -> 3415.24s]  Listen, when you backstab somebody in stealth,
[3415.24s -> 3417.64s]  you are automatically like standing up.
[3417.64s -> 3419.80s]  I wish you would just stay crouching
[3421.48s -> 3423.40s]  because if I sneak up and backstab somebody,
[3423.40s -> 3424.36s]  you're just like this.
[3424.36s -> 3425.16s]  Then you kind of just stand.
[3426.44s -> 3427.96s]  That's a little minor gripe.
[3428.60s -> 3441.56s]  Oh, you want to go again?
[3442.20s -> 3449.99s]  How would you stab somebody without standing up?
[3451.03s -> 3452.95s]  Yeah, but I mean, like this is a video game.
[3452.95s -> 3453.99s]  All right, I got the Grape Wax.
[3453.99s -> 3455.51s]  I need, actually really do need these.
[3456.23s -> 3459.14s]  This is a Nintendo game, guys.
[3459.70s -> 3465.10s]  I didn't get that item, whatever it is.
[3465.82s -> 3469.42s]  There's different rules.
[3470.06s -> 3474.89s]  How do I get in?
[3474.89s -> 3477.21s]  Oh, this whole little area over here.
[3497.69s -> 3498.57s]  What's that guy doing?
[3498.57s -> 3500.01s]  Oh, he's sucking my life up.
[3500.01s -> 3501.13s]  That guy's sucking my life up.
[3502.17s -> 3503.29s]  Oh God, what happened when this fills up?
[3504.09s -> 3505.22s]  What's wrong with me?
[3518.49s -> 3521.85s]  The only way this guy's from stage right.
[3528.17s -> 3530.65s]  All right, I think I should just keep going forward.
[3534.46s -> 3536.06s]  So it makes you enfeebled.
[3536.78s -> 3538.14s]  By the way, the one guy in chat,
[3539.48s -> 3541.32s]  I did look over there and see somebody said,
[3541.32s -> 3542.04s]  let it fill up.
[3542.04s -> 3543.72s]  You get a flute, not a joke.
[3545.21s -> 3548.49s]  Very clearly that turned out to be a fucking total bunch of horse shit.
[3549.21s -> 3552.73s]  I didn't like do that on purpose, but still like what dog shit.
[3553.98s -> 3555.98s]  Never reading chat ever again, by the way.
[3556.78s -> 3563.59s]  Like coins.
[3563.59s -> 3565.51s]  There's good, there's items here that I want.
[3566.31s -> 3567.86s]  I don't want to just disappear.
[3572.68s -> 3573.88s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[3573.88s -> 3574.36s]  Don't do it.
[3575.00s -> 3577.38s]  I think it's just line of sight.
[3577.38s -> 3588.74s]  How could you win that?
[3589.70s -> 3597.26s]  All right.
[3597.26s -> 3607.70s]  Can you, if you read this, suck a fart out of my ass.
[3607.70s -> 3609.46s]  You're gonna regret that in like five years.
[3610.34s -> 3628.14s]  Oh, there's the slide.
[3628.14s -> 3629.42s]  That's the first time I've seen that.
[3630.06s -> 3645.75s]  He's gonna regret that one in five years.
[3646.87s -> 3651.98s]  Any more items?
[3655.86s -> 3657.14s]  Uh, shitload of items over here.
[3657.86s -> 3667.64s]  Apparently somebody can still, oh, there's archers up there.
[3674.38s -> 3676.14s]  Item surrounded by dogs.
[3679.11s -> 3680.39s]  Two guys up here.
[3682.12s -> 3686.06s]  Where is, can I get up here without being seen by that one?
[3686.62s -> 3687.02s]  Yep.
[3687.02s -> 3687.82s]  See if I can get them both.
[3696.86s -> 3698.14s]  Oh, that's not a backstab.
[3698.14s -> 3699.18s]  Yes, it is in every book.
[3712.10s -> 3713.70s]  You're only an hour in right now.
[3713.70s -> 3714.58s]  Don't go too crazy.
[3714.58s -> 3715.54s]  You're gonna burn out.
[3718.01s -> 3720.41s]  I am the brightest star you've ever seen.
[3721.45s -> 3723.29s]  No, no way.
[3723.93s -> 3727.21s]  He's going to take the entire full brunt of a star.
[3728.01s -> 3730.89s]  I laughed out loud when that line went up, by the way.
[3731.85s -> 3733.13s]  No, he's crazy.
[3733.13s -> 3736.49s]  There's no way he can take the full brunt of a star.
[3737.21s -> 3740.44s]  I was the guy in the theater going.
[3741.56s -> 3761.05s]  Peek-a-boo.
[3761.05s -> 3761.69s]  That's how you do it.
[3761.69s -> 3762.65s]  I want you to fucking clip that.
[3762.65s -> 3764.41s]  I want you to fucking read into that.
[3764.41s -> 3765.61s]  When you talk about games,
[3765.61s -> 3767.37s]  gamers that you should pay attention to.
[3767.37s -> 3769.85s]  Top 10 gamers you should bet you pay attention to in 2019.
[3770.41s -> 3771.29s]  Look at that for a clip.
[3772.01s -> 3772.89s]  Keep that one.
[3772.89s -> 3788.25s]  Who's over here?
[3788.73s -> 3794.44s]  Okay, we have two dogs.
[3800.52s -> 3813.88s]  That thing got in the way.
[3814.44s -> 3815.46s]  These things are good.
[3816.10s -> 3816.98s]  Dog t-shirts.
[3820.92s -> 3821.40s]  Hydrate?
[3821.40s -> 3821.96s]  Yeah, okay.
[3835.48s -> 3835.96s]  Yeah, I don't know.
[3835.96s -> 3837.96s]  I think there's something wrong with them.
[3837.96s -> 3840.47s]  I don't know.
[3840.47s -> 3842.71s]  Like, I was watching earlier and I keep...
[3842.71s -> 3844.39s]  I feel like he was just kind of talking
[3844.39s -> 3845.59s]  like to somebody in his own head.
[3845.59s -> 3846.71s]  It was really fucking weird.
[3846.71s -> 3848.55s]  It was kind of maybe uncomfortable.
[3848.55s -> 3849.75s]  I don't think I'll be watching again.
[3859.94s -> 3860.44s]  Same.
[3861.14s -> 3863.19s]  All right, don't rest here.
[3865.24s -> 3867.24s]  You know, you have to play together and not over each other.
[3867.64s -> 3878.55s]  How many times are you gonna make the disillusioned viewer joke
[3878.55s -> 3880.79s]  as many times as I deem necessary?
[3884.34s -> 3887.14s]  Disillusioned viewer joke.
[3893.74s -> 3895.26s]  I do use it a lot, don't I?
[3900.39s -> 3908.28s]  Oh, every other streamer beat this game.
[3908.28s -> 3909.24s]  Are you taking your time?
[3909.24s -> 3910.04s]  Are you just bad?
[3910.84s -> 3911.78s]  I tag.
[3913.75s -> 3916.23s]  Yeah, did they beat the fucking true monk first try?
[3916.23s -> 3917.35s]  You showed me somebody that did.
[3917.99s -> 3923.67s]  I...
[3923.67s -> 3925.99s]  I took two days off in the middle of this playthrough.
[3926.55s -> 3927.35s]  Who the hell is that?
[3929.82s -> 3931.42s]  I first tried two bosses in a row.
[3931.42s -> 3933.42s]  You want to find me a streamer that is capable
[3933.42s -> 3934.54s]  or something like that?
[3935.18s -> 3938.06s]  I think this is just an NPC.
[3938.62s -> 3948.26s]  This is gonna be...
[3948.82s -> 3950.98s]  I've seen Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.
[3951.54s -> 3952.79s]  I'm not gonna eat that.
[3974.73s -> 3975.23s]  Okay.
[3976.73s -> 3978.41s]  The courtyard is cursed.
[3979.37s -> 3983.05s]  Ooh!
[3985.19s -> 3985.91s]  That was a big one.
[3992.39s -> 3993.91s]  They went up on two wheels for that one.
[3994.71s -> 4000.66s]  There's a bite down.
[4000.66s -> 4001.78s]  I don't even need to bite down anymore.
[4001.78s -> 4002.50s]  I have the tooth.
[4009.10s -> 4010.22s]  Uh, I need more information.
[4010.78s -> 4011.82s]  Don't go through the courtyard.
[4011.82s -> 4013.10s]  Why are you telling me this?
[4033.13s -> 4033.85s]  The Great Carp.
[4047.13s -> 4047.63s]  Alright.
[4047.93s -> 4048.89s]  This boss is a fish.
[4049.45s -> 4053.37s]  Wouldn't wish for an eternity like that.
[4053.37s -> 4054.95s]  The Great Carp.
[4056.41s -> 4056.91s]  Uh.
[4057.21s -> 4059.77s]  The courtyard is an accursed place.
[4059.77s -> 4062.17s]  And if you please, keep my heart.
[4062.17s -> 4063.77s]  I really hope this is not an underwater fight.
[4063.77s -> 4065.21s]  They gave me the dive capability.
[4065.21s -> 4066.49s]  Don't put an underwater fight here.
[4066.49s -> 4067.53s]  That's the worst thing they could do.
[4070.23s -> 4070.73s]  No.
[4071.19s -> 4073.43s]  If there really is like an underwater boss fight or something.
[4074.71s -> 4075.48s]  This guy...
[4075.48s -> 4076.12s]  I...
[4076.12s -> 4077.08s]  I already know what's gonna happen.
[4077.08s -> 4077.72s]  I'm gonna...
[4077.72s -> 4079.96s]  In like a year I'm gonna be reading
[4079.96s -> 4081.24s]  and watching YouTube videos.
[4082.28s -> 4085.32s]  Of top ten from software bosses.
[4085.32s -> 4086.28s]  And this is gonna be number one.
[4092.39s -> 4093.83s]  It wasn't the fight that was hard.
[4093.83s -> 4095.35s]  It was dealing with being underwater.
[4095.35s -> 4096.23s]  And it was unbearable.
[4096.23s -> 4096.95s]  Oh no.
[4102.47s -> 4102.97s]  Uh.
[4104.79s -> 4105.91s]  I'm not ready for this.
[4112.06s -> 4113.74s]  Go fight the giant fish.
[4113.74s -> 4114.24s]  Alright, well.
[4114.94s -> 4119.38s]  Can I like shot him up by throwing something?
[4119.38s -> 4129.48s]  That's a tactic right there.
[4129.48s -> 4137.30s]  The giant fish boss.
[4137.30s -> 4137.80s]  Oh.
[4138.34s -> 4139.50s]  Is that a boss?
[4139.50s -> 4140.14s]  No.
[4140.14s -> 4140.70s]  Mini boss?
[4141.26s -> 4153.84s]  Watch it.
[4157.52s -> 4158.02s]  No!
[4159.92s -> 4160.48s]  I can't...
[4160.48s -> 4161.52s]  I can't get, get, get, get, get.
[4161.52s -> 4162.48s]  How do I do something about this?
[4162.48s -> 4162.98s]  What do I do?
[4163.76s -> 4164.26s]  I don't know how to...
[4173.15s -> 4174.43s]  That happened so fast.
[4174.43s -> 4175.95s]  I thought I had at least a second or two.
[4178.25s -> 4178.57s]  That...
[4178.57s -> 4179.85s]  Why did that go so fast?
[4180.65s -> 4182.94s]  Dude, that...
[4184.06s -> 4187.02s]  That bar filled so much faster than it ever has.
[4194.54s -> 4195.50s]  Mad because bad.
[4195.50s -> 4196.54s]  Mad because bad.
[4196.54s -> 4197.66s]  Mad because bad.
[4197.66s -> 4198.46s]  Mad because bad.
[4200.00s -> 4201.04s]  I'm not mad at all.
[4202.00s -> 4202.50s]  I...
[4202.50s -> 4203.04s]  Look.
[4203.04s -> 4204.72s]  There's no way you saw me through there.
[4205.44s -> 4208.27s]  Stupid.
[4208.27s -> 4209.60s]  Dumb.
[4209.60s -> 4211.04s]  Nothing about it is fun.
[4211.04s -> 4212.08s]  Nothing about this is fun.
[4212.72s -> 4221.13s]  My god.
[4221.69s -> 4225.24s]  Alright, I have an indicator here.
[4225.24s -> 4225.56s]  What is it?
[4225.56s -> 4226.92s]  Is it a slash?
[4226.92s -> 4228.04s]  Is it a dash?
[4228.04s -> 4229.24s]  Is it a crash?
[4229.24s -> 4229.72s]  I don't know.
[4230.68s -> 4233.98s]  I have the indicator for what?
[4236.12s -> 4237.80s]  What is the indicator for if I can't do anything?
[4238.52s -> 4241.13s]  It's a grab, but I can't dodge.
[4241.13s -> 4245.52s]  I thought maybe you could time it and stop it.
[4252.08s -> 4256.19s]  Well, this went from my favorite area to being
[4257.15s -> 4261.93s]  my least favorite area in any From Software game that they've ever done.
[4262.65s -> 4265.40s]  And I'm talking worse than Lost Izalith.
[4265.96s -> 4273.90s]  I mean, but did you not finish this one too?
[4274.83s -> 4276.04s]  God damn.
[4276.04s -> 4277.00s]  Unbelievable.
[4277.00s -> 4277.64s]  Unbelievable.
[4280.65s -> 4281.29s]  Not even fun.
[4284.88s -> 4285.12s]  What?
[4285.12s -> 4286.48s]  What was it hitting the wall?
[4286.48s -> 4287.36s]  What was it hitting?
[4288.16s -> 4288.48s]  What?
[4289.90s -> 4290.86s]  What was it hitting?
[4296.38s -> 4297.26s]  Why was...
[4297.26s -> 4298.70s]  I couldn't do the shuriken.
[4303.63s -> 4306.27s]  Like, I threw two shurikens and it hit the thing.
[4306.35s -> 4316.99s]  It hit the fucking fence.
[4316.99s -> 4317.63s]  Don't do it again.
[4328.25s -> 4328.97s]  Give me a break.
[4341.64s -> 4342.44s]  Don't, don't, don't!
[4344.28s -> 4345.56s]  Oh my god!
[4345.56s -> 4346.52s]  I have to turn the...
[4346.52s -> 4347.24s]  Why?
[4347.24s -> 4347.56s]  Why?
[4350.35s -> 4351.47s]  I have to swing at him.
[4361.36s -> 4366.67s]  Oh my god.
[4366.67s -> 4367.79s]  Yeah, one of the only...
[4367.79s -> 4373.24s]  One of like the two stealth sections in this whole game.
[4373.24s -> 4374.20s]  Activision threw...
[4374.20s -> 4375.56s]  Activision made him do that.
[4375.56s -> 4377.64s]  Activision told him to put a stealth mechanic in.
[4378.20s -> 4381.47s]  Wait, wait, this is Activision.
[4381.47s -> 4383.23s]  We need to stealth in our video games
[4383.23s -> 4385.15s]  and all of our third-person adventure games.
[4402.30s -> 4404.30s]  Look, slow them down!
[4404.30s -> 4408.76s]  I want them to progress through this area.
[4409.32s -> 4412.88s]  That snail's fucking face.
[4412.88s -> 4415.48s]  And then they're expected to parry
[4415.48s -> 4419.48s]  like 200 fucking times in two seconds.
[4419.48s -> 4424.67s]  I don't care if they're gonna kill me.
[4424.67s -> 4425.39s]  I'll keep smoking.
[4426.11s -> 4534.92s]  What is that noise?
[4534.92s -> 4536.44s]  One, two, three...
[4538.04s -> 4549.26s]  That's not safe.
[4549.26s -> 4560.03s]  That's not safe over there.
[4560.03s -> 4561.07s]  Eel liver, cool.
[4561.07s -> 4561.79s]  It can go that way.
[4561.79s -> 4562.27s]  Let's check.
[4562.91s -> 4570.30s]  I'm just fucking around, guys.
[4570.30s -> 4578.11s]  This is faux outrage.
[4578.11s -> 4579.31s]  I'm faux angry.
[4584.67s -> 4600.03s]  Don't you guys know the true meaning of when I'm angry?
[4600.03s -> 4601.23s]  My voice gets shorter.
[4602.81s -> 4604.25s]  I don't announce the words.
[4604.25s -> 4606.78s]  I say things fast like this.
[4606.78s -> 4608.83s]  My voice drops down like this.
[4608.83s -> 4609.71s]  No, it's fucking stupid.
[4609.71s -> 4610.67s]  It's fucking dumb.
[4610.67s -> 4612.70s]  I don't fucking...
[4612.70s -> 4613.98s]  It's fucking not even fun.
[4613.98s -> 4615.07s]  That's how you can tell.
[4615.07s -> 4618.03s]  When I do like impressions of Activision fucking suits,
[4618.03s -> 4618.91s]  I'm not...
[4618.91s -> 4619.55s]  This is fun.
[4619.55s -> 4620.35s]  I'm having a good time.
[4621.80s -> 4632.00s]  Wait, why would they put this?
[4632.00s -> 4632.40s]  Of course.
[4636.99s -> 4638.27s]  Oh my god.
[4642.11s -> 4643.23s]  Please tell me they turn this way.
[4643.79s -> 4644.59s]  Did they go down there?
[4645.87s -> 4646.11s]  Why?
[4646.11s -> 4646.51s]  Did they just...
[4646.51s -> 4647.71s]  This is scripted.
[4647.71s -> 4648.75s]  This is a scripted event.
[4663.18s -> 4663.82s]  Dumb.
[4663.82s -> 4666.67s]  Okay, where do they go though?
[4679.23s -> 4680.11s]  Okay, I need to get this item
[4680.11s -> 4681.39s]  because they're gonna come back right now.
[4681.39s -> 4684.36s]  Confetti, I need that.
[4684.36s -> 4686.57s]  Oh, oh no.
[4686.57s -> 4688.01s]  Oh no, oh no, oh no.
[4688.65s -> 4689.05s]  Oh no?
[4690.57s -> 4697.39s]  They don't know where I am.
[4697.39s -> 4700.43s]  Oh fuck, I gotta kill that motherfucker right now.
[4703.76s -> 4726.33s]  Where is he?
[4726.33s -> 4727.21s]  It's Shito.
[4732.43s -> 4733.07s]  That's right.
[4733.63s -> 4734.99s]  All right, this is the strategy.
[4734.99s -> 4735.39s]  You ready?
[4735.39s -> 4737.44s]  It's saying a head has to work.
[4737.44s -> 4739.93s]  This has to work.
[4739.93s -> 4742.73s]  Okay, strategy is firecrackers.
[4743.37s -> 4746.60s]  Firecrackers kill guy.
[4746.60s -> 4749.13s]  One, two, three.
[4766.59s -> 4767.92s]  All right, I gotta shut up.
[4777.61s -> 4778.49s]  Is there anybody in here?
[4778.49s -> 4781.12s]  No, I almost just fucking died.
[4781.12s -> 4784.27s]  Okay, so I can go here.
[4785.47s -> 4787.31s]  Question is, is this the only guy in here?
[4787.31s -> 4788.44s]  I don't know.
[4788.44s -> 4793.76s]  I think that's the only guy here.
[4793.76s -> 4796.00s]  If it's not, then I'm fucking jumping right back up.
[4796.56s -> 4822.81s]  Okay, I don't think there's very...
[4822.81s -> 4824.17s]  There's only a couple guys on the bridge.
[4824.73s -> 4833.50s]  I wanna jump back up here.
[4836.00s -> 4838.16s]  I, I can't, I can't get up there.
[4838.72s -> 4841.60s]  I just came from here.
[4841.60s -> 4857.05s]  All right, there's that, that's done.
[4857.61s -> 4860.32s]  What about over here?
[4860.32s -> 4863.24s]  Anybody?
[4863.24s -> 4865.05s]  I don't think, I think I got him.
[4865.05s -> 4866.57s]  All right, I'm just gonna keep going around.
[4866.57s -> 4875.34s]  All right, what about this way?
[4875.90s -> 4877.47s]  What do we got?
[4877.47s -> 4882.52s]  We got a guy on bridge over here, right?
[4882.52s -> 4883.08s]  No.
[4883.08s -> 4884.72s]  Two guys over there.
[4884.72s -> 4888.16s]  God damn it.
[4888.16s -> 4904.75s]  Is there a way to hide up there?
[4905.31s -> 4906.59s]  Yep, can I?
[4906.59s -> 4909.20s]  I'm not sure where to go.
[4909.20s -> 4918.86s]  Is this that?
[4918.86s -> 4920.30s]  I can't go that way yet.
[4920.30s -> 4921.42s]  I mean, I guess I could.
[4921.42s -> 4922.22s]  I could backstab that.
[4922.22s -> 4923.90s]  No, the guy across the way, we'll see.
[4924.70s -> 4932.41s]  I mean, there's stealth grass right here.
[4933.05s -> 4938.17s]  Is this stealth grass?
[4938.17s -> 4939.13s]  I don't know.
[4939.13s -> 4944.65s]  Oh, God damn it.
[4948.54s -> 4950.54s]  This is a real stealth section.
[4950.54s -> 4952.84s]  They're like, you know what?
[4952.84s -> 4954.68s]  We're like 24 hours into the game.
[4954.76s -> 4957.32s]  Throw a real actual stealth section into the game.
[4962.96s -> 4965.92s]  I just, that guy not gonna turn around and see this shit.
[4967.18s -> 4969.66s]  If he does, I'm gonna be in fucking trouble.
[4974.65s -> 4975.13s]  Why?
[4976.89s -> 4977.39s]  No.
[4978.41s -> 4979.29s]  Wait, get in the water.
[4980.01s -> 4983.24s]  Oh my God, there's a guy here.
[4983.24s -> 4983.64s]  Who is it?
[4983.64s -> 4984.12s]  Who is it?
[4994.30s -> 4995.42s]  What's with the indicators?
[4996.46s -> 4997.26s]  No, don't.
[4998.06s -> 4998.62s]  Get out.
[4998.62s -> 4999.18s]  Get out.
[4999.18s -> 4999.68s]  Run.
[5000.22s -> 5008.01s]  I don't even know where that guy came from.
[5008.57s -> 5009.37s]  Oh, fuck.
[5012.43s -> 5013.79s]  Okay, I can deal with him here.
[5014.43s -> 5026.19s]  What's with the fucking, all those indicators, man?
[5027.07s -> 5028.09s]  You're killing me.
[5032.00s -> 5033.04s]  Oh, you're killing me.
[5033.84s -> 5034.88s]  It's like the president.
[5035.92s -> 5037.84s]  It's the president of the Whistle Club.
[5037.84s -> 5038.48s]  What do I do?
[5039.20s -> 5039.70s]  Is he?
[5042.56s -> 5043.92s]  It's Gandalf.
[5043.92s -> 5046.00s]  It's the Albus Dumbledore.
[5046.00s -> 5047.76s]  How many more jokes can I make before I kill him?
[5047.76s -> 5048.26s]  Let's see.
[5065.13s -> 5065.63s]  Okay.
[5067.92s -> 5069.60s]  How much more is left of this section?
[5069.60s -> 5070.72s]  I don't like this place.
[5071.76s -> 5072.56s]  I don't like this place.
[5072.56s -> 5074.24s]  It's too, if I fuck up anything.
[5075.44s -> 5076.24s]  Imagine right now.
[5076.24s -> 5077.76s]  Imagine just fucking up now.
[5078.48s -> 5080.16s]  And having to do the whole section over again.
[5080.80s -> 5082.72s]  I don't care if I look like a coward.
[5082.72s -> 5086.72s]  I'm going to do this as slow and as meticulously and stupid as I possibly can.
[5096.73s -> 5097.21s]  All right.
[5097.21s -> 5098.57s]  There's two on the bridge.
[5099.88s -> 5100.68s]  There's a guy.
[5100.68s -> 5101.88s]  There's two guys over here.
[5101.88s -> 5102.20s]  Yep.
[5102.20s -> 5104.84s]  I don't even know where the fucking president wizard came from.
[5106.57s -> 5107.69s]  I don't know.
[5107.69s -> 5109.13s]  I think he saw me from across the game.
[5110.64s -> 5137.60s]  So now, oh, how effective is this though?
[5137.60s -> 5139.12s]  Will he see me if I walk out here?
[5140.08s -> 5158.46s]  Oh my God, it works.
[5159.10s -> 5159.98s]  It works.
[5159.98s -> 5162.30s]  Holy shit, it works.
[5164.14s -> 5167.80s]  Is there any more?
[5167.80s -> 5168.20s]  I don't know.
[5168.20s -> 5168.84s]  Who's over there?
[5171.53s -> 5172.17s]  Is there a guy?
[5172.17s -> 5173.77s]  I don't, it's a position.
[5180.96s -> 5181.52s]  Slow down.
[5182.24s -> 5192.76s]  Just stay back here.
[5192.76s -> 5193.64s]  No one will know I'm here.
[5194.28s -> 5211.90s]  Man, that would have been such a nightmare.
[5211.90s -> 5213.42s]  He keeps crawling around the corner.
[5214.06s -> 5219.71s]  This is harder than a boss.
[5219.71s -> 5221.47s]  It's not, it's not that it's hard.
[5221.47s -> 5223.47s]  It's just take, oh, I found a thing.
[5230.14s -> 5230.62s]  Thank God.
[5232.20s -> 5232.84s]  Thank God.
[5234.19s -> 5235.39s]  Wait, I hear something moving.
[5236.03s -> 5242.16s]  There's going to be one right here.
[5242.16s -> 5243.68s]  I'm not going to be able to commune with this.
[5250.46s -> 5251.18s]  Oh, yes.
[5258.81s -> 5262.46s]  Oh, oh, I feel so much better.
[5262.46s -> 5263.42s]  I have money though.
[5264.14s -> 5271.90s]  I got like, I have money.
[5271.90s -> 5273.18s]  I got to go back and spend this.
[5273.98s -> 5277.72s]  What was I going to get here?
[5277.72s -> 5278.12s]  This, right?
[5278.76s -> 5281.61s]  Increases damage inflicted posture.
[5281.61s -> 5282.49s]  Successful in the cure.
[5282.49s -> 5283.05s]  I wanted this.
[5283.69s -> 5287.05s]  That one's really good.
[5287.61s -> 5289.76s]  I land that pretty frequently, so.
[5292.84s -> 5295.64s]  And I have money that I need to spend.
[5301.76s -> 5302.72s]  Why did I rest?
[5303.04s -> 5303.76s]  It's probably, I don't know.
[5303.76s -> 5304.56s]  I'm just paranoid.
[5305.12s -> 5306.56s]  And I just did it.
[5306.56s -> 5307.76s]  Muscle memory, just press the button.
[5313.55s -> 5317.32s]  Okay, let's see how much further I can go down here.
[5320.32s -> 5326.36s]  I need, I got the money, but I need gunpowder.
[5327.58s -> 5328.86s]  Does somebody sell gunpowder?
[5336.88s -> 5338.16s]  I don't think this guy does.
[5338.16s -> 5339.36s]  Who sells gunpowder?
[5342.84s -> 5347.45s]  Okay, how many do you have?
[5347.45s -> 5347.85s]  Just one?
[5350.75s -> 5353.71s]  Oh, damn, I can just buy you up 10 of them.
[5354.27s -> 5357.29s]  I need two for now, right?
[5357.29s -> 5358.09s]  Was it four or five?
[5367.80s -> 5368.36s]  What was it?
[5368.36s -> 5368.92s]  Four or five?
[5368.92s -> 5370.04s]  I think it was four.
[5370.04s -> 5370.60s]  Yeah.
[5370.60s -> 5372.84s]  All right, so this is, I'm upgrading my favorite item in the game.
[5374.03s -> 5374.75s]  Long spark.
[5375.47s -> 5379.04s]  The effect to be prolonged for longer than the average firecracker.
[5379.04s -> 5381.68s]  And the flames bloom for a short time.
[5381.68s -> 5382.00s]  Nice.
[5383.44s -> 5386.17s]  We're getting there.
[5386.17s -> 5395.18s]  Let's put it on.
[5395.18s -> 5397.42s]  So I got spring loaded firecracker.
[5398.06s -> 5399.34s]  Shinobi firecracker.
[5400.67s -> 5405.45s]  Wait, am I stupid?
[5406.01s -> 5410.30s]  No, it's got long.
[5410.30s -> 5411.18s]  Okay, I already had one.
[5411.18s -> 5412.30s]  Okay, I was like, wait a minute.
[5412.30s -> 5413.74s]  Yeah, long spark.
[5413.74s -> 5421.07s]  Let's try it.
[5421.63s -> 5429.02s]  I didn't even look at what this does.
[5430.68s -> 5433.72s]  One can fluidly swap between two separate sets of attacks as desired.
[5434.28s -> 5436.16s]  That's cool.
[5437.76s -> 5438.72s]  Spring loaded axe.
[5439.60s -> 5444.11s]  I mean, it's pretty default of me, but I really do like these the most.
[5444.75s -> 5445.71s]  Let's see how this looks.
[5449.02s -> 5450.94s]  Call me a default streamer, but that's fine.
[5452.22s -> 5454.83s]  Whoa.
[5455.47s -> 5457.63s]  Well, that takes a little longer to do, but that's,
[5464.57s -> 5465.85s]  I wonder how much different that is.
[5467.80s -> 5469.48s]  That's a long cast time.
[5471.48s -> 5471.88s]  We'll see.
[5477.13s -> 5477.61s]  No, okay.
[5477.61s -> 5478.57s]  I don't have to hold it.
[5478.57s -> 5478.81s]  All right.
[5478.81s -> 5480.17s]  That's that's looks better.
[5480.81s -> 5487.13s]  All right.
[5487.13s -> 5489.87s]  So we ended up fountainhead palace.
[5489.87s -> 5490.99s]  One, two, three.
[5493.48s -> 5497.55s]  Wait, wait, I need my money.
[5497.55s -> 5506.56s]  I got to store my money in sacks because I got 600 bucks.
[5506.56s -> 5507.92s]  I can store it.
[5517.66s -> 5519.26s]  Money is stored in the balls.
[5526.84s -> 5527.48s]  That's an old one.
[5527.48s -> 5528.20s]  That's very old.
[5528.76s -> 5536.08s]  I can buy one of these, which leaves me with 80 bucks.
[5536.08s -> 5538.56s]  So I might as well just buy a pellet for fun.
[5539.36s -> 5541.24s]  Just have a ton of them in my inventory.
[5542.12s -> 5546.19s]  And speaking of which, okay, okay, okay.
[5547.07s -> 5549.47s]  I'm ready to dish out the pain.
[5550.19s -> 5565.23s]  I've never watched you until now and heard of you from Joel,
[5565.23s -> 5567.71s]  but you good sir have me moderately entertained.
[5568.97s -> 5569.45s]  Well, welcome.
[5570.01s -> 5573.10s]  Can we get a welcome in the chat for BenRick, please?
[5573.74s -> 5577.23s]  That's what we do to all new viewers.
[5577.23s -> 5578.35s]  We welcome them.
[5578.35s -> 5582.83s]  Let me look over here.
[5585.34s -> 5585.90s]  Moderately.
[5586.38s -> 5587.82s]  Moderately entertained.
[5588.54s -> 5589.56s]  Well, that's good.
[5590.20s -> 5594.44s]  Hey, first impressions are the most important thing.
[5595.16s -> 5602.36s]  I feel like I've given a bad first impression this stream.
[5605.76s -> 5611.16s]  Ooh, more divine confetti.
[5615.26s -> 5619.58s]  Ooh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[5619.58s -> 5620.06s]  Look at this.
[5620.70s -> 5622.22s]  Something over here.
[5622.22s -> 5622.78s]  Yes, there is.
[5622.78s -> 5623.18s]  Look it.
[5625.93s -> 5628.46s]  All right.
[5634.56s -> 5635.06s]  Go.
[5636.14s -> 5636.94s]  Up, up, up, up, up.
[5636.94s -> 5637.82s]  Go up, up and jump.
[5637.82s -> 5638.78s]  Oh, jump.
[5638.78s -> 5640.22s]  Jump when he throws the toaster.
[5640.22s -> 5640.72s]  Quick.
[5642.56s -> 5643.92s]  Jesus, that saved me.
[5643.92s -> 5644.40s]  Did you see?
[5644.40s -> 5645.20s]  I've done that too.
[5645.84s -> 5646.80s]  What the fuck is that?
[5648.62s -> 5649.50s]  Was that the lightning?
[5650.22s -> 5651.42s]  What just crashed through the bridge?
[5652.22s -> 5654.57s]  What the hell was that?
[5655.93s -> 5657.29s]  What just went in the water?
[5663.55s -> 5666.09s]  Uh, okay.
[5666.89s -> 5672.19s]  I thought that was a lightning bolt.
[5672.91s -> 5674.36s]  I'm going to rest.
[5675.77s -> 5677.21s]  If I rest, the bridge will be back, right?
[5680.35s -> 5680.91s]  God damn it.
[5680.91s -> 5682.11s]  This is Mario World.
[5682.11s -> 5683.23s]  This is the fish from Mario.
[5683.23s -> 5684.19s]  It's the same colors too.
[5684.91s -> 5688.30s]  This is the gigantic fish from Super Mario World.
[5688.30s -> 5689.34s]  Level three, six.
[5689.98s -> 5700.99s]  Dear God.
[5704.94s -> 5706.70s]  Well, I made it across the bridge.
[5707.34s -> 5708.83s]  Is he just in there?
[5710.96s -> 5713.28s]  It's a water boss fight.
[5713.28s -> 5715.04s]  It's an underwater boss fight.
[5715.04s -> 5716.56s]  Oh, I'm not happy about this.
[5717.84s -> 5720.24s]  No, I'm so bad underwater in every game.
[5721.44s -> 5723.36s]  I'm terrible under pressure.
[5724.00s -> 5725.52s]  Literally by the water pressure.
[5725.52s -> 5726.32s]  I can't do it.
[5730.75s -> 5731.55s]  Oh no.
[5731.55s -> 5732.75s]  I'm panicking already.
[5732.75s -> 5734.43s]  I'm like psyching myself up.
[5768.68s -> 5769.48s]  I want to get up there.
[5770.20s -> 5771.42s]  Because there's an item.
[5776.76s -> 5779.12s]  Can I make this jump from here?
[5779.76s -> 5780.88s]  I don't think I can make this jump.
[5784.51s -> 5785.87s]  Well, let's take care of this first.
[5786.67s -> 5793.49s]  Hey.
[5794.03s -> 5799.69s]  Aggressive.
[5799.69s -> 5800.25s]  Aggressive.
[5800.25s -> 5800.75s]  Aggressive.
[5801.61s -> 5806.76s]  Can I get up top?
[5806.76s -> 5807.26s]  Maybe.
[5808.51s -> 5809.23s]  I can go there.
[5814.19s -> 5815.31s]  And then over here.
[5816.11s -> 5816.91s]  Oh, come on.
[5816.91s -> 5817.41s]  No.
[5819.39s -> 5820.80s]  Wait.
[5820.80s -> 5821.20s]  Stop.
[5821.20s -> 5821.60s]  Stop.
[5821.60s -> 5821.92s]  Stop.
[5821.92s -> 5822.16s]  Stop.
[5822.16s -> 5823.04s]  Just where am I?
[5823.60s -> 5827.36s]  Where the fuck did I end up?
[5829.13s -> 5831.40s]  Uh, the hell?
[5833.24s -> 5833.88s]  I'm-
[5833.88s -> 5840.03s]  I can get back up.
[5840.03s -> 5841.23s]  I just heard a fucking burp.
[5841.95s -> 5843.36s]  That was a burp?
[5849.74s -> 5850.14s]  All right.
[5850.14s -> 5851.10s]  Let's get back over here.
[5851.74s -> 5857.40s]  All right.
[5857.40s -> 5859.07s]  Takes us down here.
[5860.03s -> 5863.37s]  God, I'm just gonna have to jump from here, right?
[5864.17s -> 5865.92s]  Am I gonna make this?
[5866.56s -> 5868.25s]  There's nowhere to grab.
[5883.36s -> 5884.56s]  Guys, I scream in real life.
[5885.04s -> 5887.16s]  Okay, when something like that happens.
[5887.72s -> 5889.29s]  Okay.
[5889.29s -> 5890.09s]  What am I doing here?
[5890.09s -> 5890.33s]  Just-
[5890.33s -> 5890.81s]  I forget it.
[5890.81s -> 5891.21s]  Forget it.
[5891.21s -> 5891.61s]  Forget it.
[5891.61s -> 5892.25s]  I don't even want it.
[5893.44s -> 5894.24s]  Yeah, I do.
[5894.24s -> 5894.64s]  No, I don't.
[5894.64s -> 5896.00s]  I don't even want it.
[5896.00s -> 5899.69s]  I should change my title too.
[5899.69s -> 5901.93s]  When I get hit, I pretend to get hurt in the game.
[5902.97s -> 5905.23s]  Ha ha ha.
[5906.19s -> 5912.01s]  Did you see that?
[5913.74s -> 5915.98s]  What was with that spawn thing?
[5915.98s -> 5917.58s]  Did you see the spawns here?
[5925.87s -> 5926.19s]  What?
[5927.79s -> 5933.47s]  All right.
[5933.47s -> 5934.11s]  Guy over there.
[5934.67s -> 5938.54s]  I'm just trying to cover all my bases here, guys.
[5945.08s -> 5946.92s]  I don't want any bullshit to come kill me.
[5946.92s -> 5950.44s]  Somebody to fly and gonzo me or something.
[5950.44s -> 5951.24s]  We're taking care of-
[5951.24s -> 5952.44s]  Oh, I can get through from here.
[5952.44s -> 5952.76s]  I win.
[5953.64s -> 5963.55s]  Figured it out.
[5963.55s -> 5964.92s]  No, I can't.
[5966.28s -> 5966.92s]  Really?
[5966.92s -> 5968.44s]  There's no way for me to get any-
[5968.60s -> 5969.56s]  Grab anything from here?
[5971.60s -> 5972.64s]  How do I get this item?
[5976.51s -> 5977.55s]  How do I get that item?
[5982.94s -> 5983.66s]  There's a bridge.
[5984.60s -> 5985.72s]  I can't cross the bridge.
[5986.36s -> 5988.97s]  Do you not see the bridge broken in half?
[5988.97s -> 5989.93s]  I can't make that jump.
[5992.94s -> 5994.22s]  Cross the bridge?
[5994.22s -> 5995.50s]  That's a forehead comment, right?
[6002.83s -> 6003.95s]  Just cross the bridge.
[6003.95s -> 6004.67s]  Forehead.
[6004.67s -> 6005.31s]  It has to be.
[6005.87s -> 6007.47s]  There's no bridge.
[6011.95s -> 6013.07s]  Rebuild it.
[6016.64s -> 6017.04s]  All right.
[6017.04s -> 6018.40s]  Are you ready for this one?
[6018.40s -> 6018.88s]  No.
[6018.88s -> 6019.44s]  Just kidding.
[6022.46s -> 6023.26s]  I have a feeling.
[6023.74s -> 6027.88s]  Let's just keep moving.
[6027.88s -> 6028.36s]  Whatever.
[6028.36s -> 6029.80s]  That item is probably the best item in the game,
[6029.80s -> 6030.60s]  and I'm not going to get it.
[6031.48s -> 6034.96s]  Whatever.
[6042.54s -> 6044.38s]  There's an equally as cool item down here.
[6048.14s -> 6048.46s]  Wait.
[6051.20s -> 6052.96s]  No secret waterfall entrance?
[6053.68s -> 6055.87s]  Is there?
[6055.87s -> 6064.17s]  Okay.
[6064.17s -> 6064.65s]  What about-
[6064.65s -> 6065.13s]  Let me just check.
[6065.77s -> 6067.48s]  Okay.
[6067.48s -> 6068.68s]  I can go up from there.
[6069.56s -> 6072.19s]  I want to get that, whatever it is, though.
[6072.99s -> 6074.43s]  And then I can get back up, right?
[6075.23s -> 6079.40s]  Is that a water dog?
[6080.38s -> 6081.26s]  Two water dogs.
[6084.59s -> 6086.24s]  Three water dogs.
[6086.24s -> 6087.12s]  Four water dogs?
[6089.29s -> 6089.85s]  Oh, fuck!
[6090.09s -> 6091.29s]  It's an electricity dog!
[6091.85s -> 6092.41s]  Kill it quick.
[6093.37s -> 6094.33s]  Oh, my god.
[6096.49s -> 6097.85s]  Wouldn't that kill the dog?
[6098.73s -> 6099.85s]  It would kill the dog.
[6100.91s -> 6102.35s]  Um, where?
[6103.66s -> 6104.22s]  Where are-
[6104.22s -> 6104.78s]  Where?
[6112.78s -> 6114.62s]  Just because you have electricity coming out of you
[6114.62s -> 6116.46s]  doesn't mean you're immune to electricity.
[6117.26s -> 6117.58s]  Okay?
[6118.38s -> 6123.24s]  That was lucky.
[6123.96s -> 6125.34s]  Don't you know?
[6125.34s -> 6127.98s]  Even when Pikachu gets struck by lightning,
[6127.98s -> 6129.90s]  it still does like 5% damage.
[6130.70s -> 6131.90s]  It's just not very effective.
[6132.54s -> 6133.56s]  It still hurts.
[6136.96s -> 6137.28s]  Even-
[6137.28s -> 6140.64s]  Okay, if you put yourself in a suit of armor
[6141.72s -> 6143.24s]  and then you jumped in front of a train,
[6144.20s -> 6144.92s]  you're gonna be fine.
[6144.92s -> 6145.80s]  It's gonna hurt, though.
[6153.34s -> 6153.98s]  That was a baby.
[6155.88s -> 6162.22s]  No, no, no!
[6162.22s -> 6163.34s]  No, no, no!
[6163.34s -> 6164.38s]  No, no, no!
[6164.38s -> 6165.42s]  Oh, no!
[6165.42s -> 6166.46s]  Oh, no!
[6166.46s -> 6171.36s]  Nooooooooooooo!
[6171.36s -> 6173.08s]  He has a laser!
[6176.56s -> 6178.16s]  The laser can shoot through the wall!
[6179.04s -> 6181.92s]  He has a laser that shoots through walls.
[6193.61s -> 6194.57s]  Fuck that.
[6194.65s -> 6195.85s]  I don't want to fight you.
[6195.85s -> 6196.33s]  I don't care.
[6198.56s -> 6199.52s]  Okay, get me up.
[6199.52s -> 6200.00s]  Jump!
[6200.00s -> 6200.64s]  Grab it!
[6200.64s -> 6200.88s]  No!
[6202.28s -> 6203.56s]  No, get me away!
[6203.56s -> 6205.08s]  Is he gonna shoot me through the wall?
[6205.08s -> 6207.64s]  How far does his, like, smite ultimate beam go?
[6209.05s -> 6209.55s]  Ugh!
[6210.99s -> 6211.71s]  Okay.
[6211.71s -> 6212.27s]  We're alright.
[6220.86s -> 6221.42s]  Jesus.
[6222.97s -> 6226.03s]  Um, I think I gotta go into that building.
[6226.67s -> 6227.63s]  If I were taking a guess.
[6228.27s -> 6231.85s]  Could deal with these, too.
[6233.79s -> 6234.75s]  I still have plenty of health.
[6234.75s -> 6235.71s]  I got out of there quick.
[6235.71s -> 6236.43s]  That was lucky.
[6236.99s -> 6241.34s]  Let me deal with one of these.
[6241.42s -> 6242.62s]  Yeah, let's...
[6242.62s -> 6243.26s]  Oh, man.
[6243.26s -> 6243.98s]  That's too many.
[6247.21s -> 6247.53s]  Uh...
[6248.25s -> 6249.96s]  What's this way?
[6250.60s -> 6255.29s]  I think I have to.
[6256.57s -> 6257.21s]  I don't...
[6257.21s -> 6257.61s]  I don't know.
[6262.80s -> 6263.20s]  Fuck it.
[6273.36s -> 6275.92s]  Okay, watch out for the guy playing soccer!
[6275.92s -> 6277.28s]  Alright, where do I go?
[6277.28s -> 6277.92s]  Where do I go?
[6278.80s -> 6279.44s]  Where do I go?
[6280.91s -> 6281.79s]  Where's progression?
[6284.17s -> 6285.45s]  I think I'm going over this way.
[6286.25s -> 6287.53s]  Yep, I found progression.
[6288.60s -> 6290.04s]  There's no way I can do that.
[6290.04s -> 6290.44s]  I'm sorry.
[6290.44s -> 6291.08s]  I'm not gonna...
[6291.08s -> 6292.28s]  I'm not stupid.
[6292.28s -> 6302.92s]  He's a lightning dog.
[6303.88s -> 6305.32s]  Be prepared!
[6305.32s -> 6306.20s]  Be prepared for the lightning!
[6311.58s -> 6315.84s]  Progression.
[6318.06s -> 6326.59s]  Litecoin is down like seven or eight hundred percent since last year.
[6330.72s -> 6332.08s]  More electricity dogs.
[6345.29s -> 6346.41s]  That's a new enemy there.
[6346.41s -> 6347.77s]  That's a big guy.
[6347.77s -> 6349.29s]  It's a big bearded octopus person.
[6351.44s -> 6351.76s]  Um...
[6365.44s -> 6369.36s]  Does he have two bars?
[6369.36s -> 6369.68s]  That's a...
[6369.68s -> 6373.07s]  Is that a mini boss or is that an NPC?
[6373.07s -> 6373.95s]  I don't know.
[6373.95s -> 6375.72s]  I'm gonna keep going around this way.
[6375.72s -> 6376.28s]  I'm gonna progress.
[6378.04s -> 6379.24s]  Go fight it just to hold on.
[6379.96s -> 6381.40s]  I'm not gonna go fight that right now.
[6381.40s -> 6382.52s]  I need a new stone.
[6384.33s -> 6386.17s]  If I die, I have to go all the way.
[6386.17s -> 6388.09s]  You can't even see how far away I have to go.
[6388.09s -> 6388.73s]  All the way down there.
[6391.71s -> 6393.71s]  This is like 35 minutes of progression.
[6394.86s -> 6395.82s]  I ain't gonna blow this.
[6408.94s -> 6411.34s]  Oh, what the fuck are you talking about, man?
[6411.34s -> 6412.83s]  Are you serious?
[6413.47s -> 6414.57s]  There's another one.
[6416.04s -> 6418.28s]  Why is there another one here?
[6418.28s -> 6419.24s]  Do I have to go?
[6422.72s -> 6423.04s]  I...
[6423.04s -> 6423.52s]  I don't...
[6423.52s -> 6424.40s]  I don't believe it.
[6424.40s -> 6425.44s]  I'm not going over there.
[6426.24s -> 6426.88s]  I have to though.
[6427.68s -> 6428.44s]  I have to...
[6431.52s -> 6432.56s]  That's the same one?
[6433.36s -> 6434.08s]  No, it's not.
[6434.88s -> 6435.20s]  There was...
[6435.20s -> 6436.56s]  The other one was down that way.
[6437.36s -> 6439.16s]  Is there any way I can go up from there?
[6439.16s -> 6439.80s]  I just need to look.
[6441.02s -> 6441.66s]  I think I can.
[6442.56s -> 6442.88s]  Dodge.
[6442.88s -> 6443.20s]  I could...
[6443.20s -> 6443.44s]  I have to...
[6443.44s -> 6444.80s]  Dodges have to be on point right now.
[6451.98s -> 6453.50s]  Yeah, call that one in sick.
[6457.16s -> 6457.72s]  Yeah.
[6457.72s -> 6458.12s]  Yeah.
[6458.12s -> 6458.44s]  Oh.
[6461.48s -> 6462.60s]  What am I doing?
[6463.16s -> 6464.20s]  Hope this is not a bad idea.
[6465.50s -> 6465.82s]  Um...
[6469.95s -> 6470.19s]  Uh...
[6472.12s -> 6472.44s]  Uh...
[6472.44s -> 6472.60s]  Uh...
[6474.27s -> 6474.67s]  Um...
[6475.39s -> 6476.67s]  I'm actually terrified.
[6477.39s -> 6484.62s]  Is there a beach?
[6484.62s -> 6485.10s]  A house?
[6487.42s -> 6487.82s]  Come on.
[6487.82s -> 6488.86s]  Give me a thing to grab.
[6490.86s -> 6491.90s]  Come on, please.
[6493.02s -> 6494.22s]  No, don't do it like this.
[6494.22s -> 6495.18s]  Don't do it like this.
[6496.14s -> 6497.55s]  Something to grab.
[6499.04s -> 6499.44s]  I can't...
[6499.44s -> 6500.24s]  Nothing to grab?
[6501.82s -> 6502.70s]  Oh, come on.
[6503.42s -> 6504.38s]  You got to be kidding me.
[6504.38s -> 6505.42s]  Not like this, man.
[6508.41s -> 6509.05s]  I can make it.
[6509.69s -> 6512.54s]  I can make it.
[6546.11s -> 6547.21s]  Fuck.
[6547.21s -> 6547.53s]  Uh...
[6550.91s -> 6551.79s]  Oh, no.
[6552.83s -> 6553.79s]  Kill that guy first.
[6553.79s -> 6555.07s]  I don't even know where that guy is.
[6555.07s -> 6555.95s]  He's like up here.
[6573.56s -> 6575.40s]  I just killed probably the least dangerous guy.
[6589.26s -> 6591.02s]  He just double tapped me.
[6591.02s -> 6592.62s]  No, that's not fair.
[6593.74s -> 6596.70s]  I was on the ground and it bounced on my head.
[6598.06s -> 6598.38s]  What?
[6599.34s -> 6600.22s]  Oh, fuck off.
[6600.78s -> 6601.58s]  Fuck off with this.
[6601.58s -> 6602.22s]  I'm out of here.
[6604.64s -> 6605.44s]  There's no way...
[6605.44s -> 6606.48s]  I don't know where to go.
[6607.04s -> 6608.00s]  There's no way to go.
[6612.03s -> 6615.20s]  There's an item.
[6615.20s -> 6618.72s]  Oh, shit.
[6618.72s -> 6619.44s]  There's two items.
[6619.44s -> 6619.76s]  Nice.
[6620.32s -> 6636.17s]  And there's that guy over here, too.
[6644.76s -> 6646.52s]  There's got to be one path to get back...
[6646.52s -> 6647.40s]  To get up this way.
[6649.18s -> 6649.42s]  Right?
[6649.42s -> 6649.74s]  Like, look.
[6649.74s -> 6650.78s]  It's over there.
[6650.78s -> 6652.30s]  I can't get up from here.
[6658.76s -> 6660.04s]  There's the bad guy.
[6660.04s -> 6662.04s]  It appears as an illusion.
[6662.76s -> 6664.20s]  What about behind the waterfall?
[6664.20s -> 6664.84s]  I'm going for it.
[6664.84s -> 6665.16s]  Let's see.
[6665.96s -> 6666.20s]  Nope.
[6669.55s -> 6670.51s]  That ain't going to happen.
[6670.51s -> 6671.79s]  That just ain't going to happen.
[6671.79s -> 6673.53s]  That's not going to happen.
[6673.53s -> 6683.72s]  It's just that ain't going to happen.
[6684.36s -> 6685.48s]  I have to get the terror potion.
[6685.48s -> 6686.76s]  Anybody that has the terror buildup
[6686.76s -> 6688.52s]  that takes five seconds for the terror to kill you?
[6690.38s -> 6691.42s]  You've got to get confetti
[6691.42s -> 6693.34s]  and you have to get the terror potion shit.
[6710.75s -> 6711.95s]  You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[6712.83s -> 6714.59s]  Did you really just hit me from that far away?
[6715.39s -> 6716.35s]  What game is this?
[6717.53s -> 6718.97s]  What video game is this?
[6721.02s -> 6723.26s]  I was a homing missile from across the game.
[6723.26s -> 6725.10s]  What game is this?
[6744.30s -> 6745.42s]  Kill the streamer.
[6746.14s -> 6759.04s]  I just don't...
[6759.04s -> 6760.56s]  I'm maybe on the roof?
[6761.44s -> 6762.08s]  Like, up here?
[6763.12s -> 6764.32s]  I got from behind.
[6767.02s -> 6767.98s]  Oh my god.
[6768.86s -> 6769.36s]  Why?
[6770.38s -> 6770.88s]  Why?
[6775.12s -> 6776.88s]  I have to go all the way around this.
[6781.90s -> 6783.66s]  I'm trying to just skip.
[6783.66s -> 6784.86s]  Thanks for the unforeseen aid.
[6785.42s -> 6786.14s]  Appreciate it.
[6786.14s -> 6786.70s]  No, fuck it.
[6786.70s -> 6787.18s]  I'm just gone.
[6790.48s -> 6790.98s]  Go.
[6791.93s -> 6792.43s]  Go.
[6801.90s -> 6802.86s]  Fuck off.
[6802.86s -> 6805.66s]  Can I make this from here?
[6808.01s -> 6808.49s]  I don't know.
[6808.49s -> 6808.99s]  Let me try.
[6820.36s -> 6821.64s]  What's the ultimate goal?
[6822.81s -> 6824.41s]  To go back around this way?
[6825.21s -> 6833.26s]  Like, up there?
[6833.26s -> 6834.14s]  But I...
[6834.14s -> 6835.58s]  How the fuck do I get over there?
[6835.58s -> 6861.90s]  I can grab it from here, but there's no grabbing point.
[6863.02s -> 6864.54s]  Like, underneath and then up?
[6864.54s -> 6865.82s]  That's kind of what I did before.
[6866.86s -> 6868.54s]  Because there's no grabbing point here.
[6897.74s -> 6898.46s]  Oh, thank god.
[6899.02s -> 6900.33s]  I found it.
[6900.33s -> 6900.83s]  Okay.
[6900.83s -> 6902.01s]  Slow down, slow down, slow down.
[6902.57s -> 6909.66s]  There's a door.
[6909.66s -> 6910.16s]  Come.
[6910.94s -> 6911.44s]  Who?
[6921.77s -> 6922.97s]  No, I don't dare.
[6922.97s -> 6927.15s]  Of course not.
[6927.15s -> 6927.65s]  Ah.
[6933.50s -> 6935.58s]  Everybody's still alive, so this is bad.
[6936.22s -> 6948.32s]  I'll take one at a time.
[6950.01s -> 6950.65s]  Come on, let's go.
[6950.65s -> 6950.97s]  Fight.
[6950.97s -> 6951.93s]  Let's go, let's go, let's go.
[6951.93s -> 6953.29s]  Come on, I can take two.
[6953.29s -> 6954.17s]  I've done it before.
[6954.17s -> 6954.97s]  I'm scum good.
[6970.75s -> 6971.71s]  You too, come on.
[6971.71s -> 6986.78s]  Goff.
[6995.12s -> 6997.92s]  Anybody else up here?
[6997.92s -> 6999.52s]  Anybody, anybody, anybody?
[6999.52s -> 7003.82s]  I just don't want to have a problem later.
[7009.88s -> 7012.60s]  Video games, video games, video games, video games, video games.
[7012.60s -> 7014.81s]  All right, maybe I shouldn't have any more caffeine.
[7021.28s -> 7025.21s]  What's wrong with you?
[7025.21s -> 7026.33s]  I'm just happy.
[7026.33s -> 7027.37s]  I'm just having a good time.
[7029.45s -> 7031.53s]  Now, this is where I'm going to make a major mistake.
[7033.60s -> 7035.92s]  Can I jump from here and grab something over there?
[7040.32s -> 7041.44s]  No, I'm going to go that way.
[7046.65s -> 7048.57s]  Because there's a place I haven't gone down there.
[7049.45s -> 7051.10s]  And we're going to do it.
[7051.10s -> 7052.54s]  Don't get stuck in a wall.
[7053.88s -> 7055.40s]  I'm going to do it the correct way,
[7055.40s -> 7058.20s]  which is like stuff my body in here
[7058.20s -> 7059.32s]  and glitch into the wall
[7059.32s -> 7061.16s]  and to a point where I can fall down those stairs.
[7064.78s -> 7066.46s]  I fucking, I hate myself so much.
[7067.02s -> 7068.22s]  I fucking can't believe it.
[7068.22s -> 7069.50s]  There's an invisible wall there.
[7069.50s -> 7070.38s]  I can't fucking believe it.
[7070.38s -> 7071.10s]  I cannot believe it.
[7071.10s -> 7072.06s]  I can't believe it.
[7072.06s -> 7073.34s]  I can't believe it.
[7073.34s -> 7079.00s]  I can't fucking believe it.
[7079.96s -> 7087.49s]  Skip.
[7089.55s -> 7091.23s]  I'm so disappointed in myself.
[7093.31s -> 7094.43s]  I'm so disappointed.
[7095.07s -> 7107.48s]  Oh, the disappointment is unreal down here.
[7107.48s -> 7109.56s]  Like typically I would be mad about
[7109.56s -> 7111.48s]  like the bad grade I got on my report card.
[7112.28s -> 7113.40s]  None of my parents would be.
[7114.12s -> 7116.20s]  My parents would be upset with what I just brought home.
[7116.20s -> 7118.20s]  I'm actually more upset than they are.
[7119.08s -> 7130.57s]  Why does that keep happening?
[7130.57s -> 7131.29s]  All right, let's go.
[7131.93s -> 7142.25s]  Line of sight.
[7142.25s -> 7143.77s]  I can't hit anything through a goddamn wall.
[7163.16s -> 7163.66s]  Stupid.
[7165.61s -> 7166.73s]  You're almost as dumb as me.
[7176.52s -> 7177.48s]  There's an idol right there.
[7192.19s -> 7193.07s]  Is this a mini boss?
[7194.08s -> 7194.80s]  Target him so I...
[7194.80s -> 7195.76s]  No, it's not a mini boss.
[7196.64s -> 7199.20s]  I just have to deal with this.
[7199.20s -> 7199.84s]  Sit down.
[7199.84s -> 7200.64s]  Don't stand up.
[7200.64s -> 7201.14s]  Hey, guy.
[7234.68s -> 7236.28s]  The nightmare is over.
[7236.28s -> 7236.68s]  For now.
[7246.25s -> 7246.89s]  For now.
[7246.89s -> 7248.64s]  How much money do I have?
[7248.64s -> 7249.52s]  I got a lot of money.
[7253.39s -> 7255.23s]  I'm going back and buying a gift.
[7255.23s -> 7256.03s]  What the hell they are.
[7260.54s -> 7261.10s]  500...
[7261.10s -> 7262.14s]  It's a lot of money in this game.
[7272.64s -> 7275.95s]  You guys don't think 500 dollars is a lot of money?
[7275.95s -> 7277.07s]  What are you talking about?
[7277.63s -> 7278.59s]  Buy 50.
[7278.59s -> 7280.43s]  Oh, shit.
[7280.43s -> 7281.87s]  Okay, I'll sell a couple of dumb things.
[7286.38s -> 7290.25s]  Where's my large amount of ashes?
[7290.25s -> 7291.05s]  Yeah, whatever.
[7291.53s -> 7300.54s]  Next time.
[7305.34s -> 7305.82s]  Continue.
[7310.48s -> 7312.32s]  Great Sakura.
[7312.32s -> 7325.32s]  Jerma's afraid of headless?
[7325.32s -> 7325.72s]  Yeah, I am.
[7327.55s -> 7328.67s]  But I can admit that.
[7329.39s -> 7330.59s]  I'm terrified of finding that.
[7330.59s -> 7332.27s]  I'm terrified of finding any of the magical people.
[7334.91s -> 7336.51s]  Let me just try to kill this guy for fun.
[7337.07s -> 7349.56s]  Dragon...
[7349.56s -> 7350.28s]  Oh, Gatsaki.
[7350.92s -> 7357.07s]  That didn't hit him.
[7358.43s -> 7372.14s]  That's not gonna work.
[7372.14s -> 7374.59s]  Somebody else is hitting him now.
[7375.23s -> 7376.43s]  That was a bad idea.
[7376.43s -> 7377.55s]  Um, that was fun.
[7377.55s -> 7378.43s]  I'm gonna go this way now.
[7379.84s -> 7381.28s]  Oh, there's a mini boss.
[7382.33s -> 7382.89s]  Under pressure.
[7382.89s -> 7383.93s]  That's how I work.
[7383.93s -> 7384.41s]  What is that?
[7385.21s -> 7386.64s]  Okay, he kicks balls.
[7387.60s -> 7388.48s]  That's a lightning ball.
[7388.48s -> 7388.80s]  I got...
[7388.80s -> 7390.88s]  Okay, I got these idiots over here like fighting me.
[7390.88s -> 7391.28s]  Just die.
[7392.32s -> 7395.58s]  Like, I've got five people throwing rocks at me from behind me.
[7399.69s -> 7400.57s]  Come on.
[7400.57s -> 7406.46s]  Let's go.
[7406.46s -> 7407.02s]  You and me.
[7407.02s -> 7407.90s]  Lightning balls?
[7407.90s -> 7408.40s]  Fine.
[7409.10s -> 7410.22s]  Just get up on him right now.
[7413.10s -> 7413.82s]  But that hit me.
[7417.04s -> 7417.60s]  That's okay.
[7417.60s -> 7418.80s]  You have to long wind up.
[7419.52s -> 7424.75s]  Long is even longer than that.
[7431.10s -> 7431.58s]  Wait, didn't I...
[7431.58s -> 7433.34s]  Don't I have a move to stop that from happening?
[7433.34s -> 7433.82s]  Okay, what...
[7434.46s -> 7438.04s]  Don't I...
[7438.04s -> 7439.16s]  I thought I could, like...
[7439.16s -> 7443.56s]  Oh, that guy...
[7443.56s -> 7444.04s]  You suck.
[7444.68s -> 7447.15s]  I'm gonna pray for that, though.
[7447.87s -> 7451.42s]  Yeah, it's attack while you're in the air.
[7451.42s -> 7451.98s]  Don't just...
[7451.98s -> 7453.10s]  Fucking my god.
[7453.10s -> 7454.06s]  I know how to do it.
[7454.06s -> 7455.74s]  You don't have to, like, demonstrate.
[7456.38s -> 7457.34s]  Oh, thank god.
[7458.06s -> 7458.83s]  Oh, yeah.
[7458.83s -> 7459.31s]  At first sight.
[7459.31s -> 7459.87s]  At first speed.
[7459.87s -> 7460.51s]  At first sound.
[7461.07s -> 7465.85s]  I gotta breathe.
[7479.16s -> 7479.48s]  Nice.
[7479.48s -> 7480.12s]  Thousand bucks.
[7480.68s -> 7481.48s]  All right.
[7481.48s -> 7482.76s]  There's no more electricity.
[7483.92s -> 7484.32s]  Except that...
[7484.32s -> 7485.28s]  Is that guy electricity?
[7487.84s -> 7488.48s]  Electricity?
[7488.48s -> 7488.80s]  Gone.
[7489.52s -> 7492.57s]  I gotta kill this guy.
[7495.55s -> 7496.83s]  He's facing the other way.
[7496.83s -> 7501.23s]  You don't even know I'm here.
[7509.13s -> 7509.37s]  Oh.
[7510.33s -> 7511.37s]  It's this lady.
[7511.37s -> 7518.54s]  I was supposed to backstab this lady.
[7528.91s -> 7530.11s]  You got these great directions.
[7530.99s -> 7536.36s]  Large cave.
[7542.75s -> 7543.07s]  No.
[7545.18s -> 7545.90s]  Here it comes.
[7545.90s -> 7547.98s]  I've been trying to avoid having to do this.
[7552.19s -> 7553.39s]  Open the door to the palace.
[7554.35s -> 7558.12s]  It's under water and it's through a cave that's down here under the water.
[7559.00s -> 7561.15s]  And by the way, fight the fish boss.
[7568.92s -> 7570.36s]  Well, it begins.
[7572.86s -> 7574.06s]  See you guys in, like, four hours.
[7574.62s -> 7589.68s]  Lump of wax.
[7590.81s -> 7591.37s]  Okay.
[7591.37s -> 7597.68s]  So, is the palace this way or is the palace under here?
[7598.40s -> 7600.24s]  Let's just take a look under water.
[7600.96s -> 7607.50s]  It's over here.
[7607.58s -> 7608.70s]  The great carp.
[7608.70s -> 7611.26s]  Ah, I'm not an underwater boss.
[7612.76s -> 7614.92s]  No, they can't do it to us like this.
[7614.92s -> 7616.60s]  They can't do this to us like this.
[7632.24s -> 7633.28s]  God damn it.
[7635.74s -> 7637.55s]  Fuck.
[7637.55s -> 7638.99s]  It's a giant goldfish.
[7639.63s -> 7652.35s]  Whatever this is, just let me have it.
[7652.35s -> 7652.99s]  Coin purse.
[7653.71s -> 7655.47s]  Oh my God.
[7659.39s -> 7659.87s]  He's dead?
[7660.43s -> 7660.91s]  He's dead.
[7661.72s -> 7662.68s]  He's dead.
[7662.68s -> 7663.32s]  I killed him.
[7664.70s -> 7674.32s]  I killed him.
[7674.32s -> 7678.48s]  He rolled over like he was in somebody's tank.
[7679.04s -> 7679.36s]  What?
[7681.36s -> 7684.01s]  Why did he do that?
[7684.73s -> 7686.67s]  Just get me out.
[7694.35s -> 7695.84s]  Am I safe in here?
[7696.48s -> 7699.52s]  But where is the...
[7699.52s -> 7700.00s]  How do I get...
[7700.64s -> 7703.76s]  Is there a hole up there?
[7703.76s -> 7713.84s]  Oh my God.
[7713.84s -> 7714.96s]  Jeremy, get in the hole, please.
[7722.14s -> 7732.11s]  He seriously rolled over like he was dead.
[7732.11s -> 7733.55s]  Like that was his final breath.
[7734.27s -> 7746.51s]  I made it.
[7746.51s -> 7749.39s]  He smashed his head into a rock.
[7753.47s -> 7754.75s]  His last dash.
[7755.95s -> 7757.23s]  That's so funny.
[7757.23s -> 7758.51s]  I wish that were the case.
[7762.12s -> 7764.52s]  Well, waterfall.
[7765.08s -> 7765.87s]  I guess.
[7766.43s -> 7769.74s]  What's up here?
[7774.16s -> 7775.48s]  Wait, I'm gonna...
[7775.48s -> 7776.36s]  Let me examine first.
[7776.92s -> 7779.10s]  You never know.
[7779.10s -> 7779.98s]  There might be something hidden.
[7785.60s -> 7786.08s]  No.
[7786.08s -> 7786.96s]  It was worth a shot.
[7795.04s -> 7795.68s]  Up.
[7795.68s -> 7801.63s]  Hmm.
[7801.63s -> 7803.64s]  I think I found the back door to the palace.
[7807.80s -> 7809.96s]  This really is a pretty, pretty, pretty zone.
[7810.60s -> 7812.76s]  The fish.
[7812.76s -> 7813.56s]  That fish is cool.
[7814.36s -> 7816.91s]  Thank God I don't have to fight it right now.
[7817.63s -> 7820.30s]  Hopefully it's just like the snake from earlier.
[7820.30s -> 7822.70s]  And it's just a giant annoying obstacle.
[7823.42s -> 7832.92s]  I'm missing a ton of hidden shit.
[7832.92s -> 7836.20s]  Yeah, look, I can go back there any time I want.
[7836.84s -> 7838.52s]  I have a new sculpture here.
[7839.58s -> 7840.30s]  I am safe.
[7854.68s -> 7857.42s]  Let's see what's in here.
[7861.28s -> 7862.88s]  This is a room full of those people.
[7863.68s -> 7868.40s]  I'm getting bloodborne vibes from these people.
[7875.64s -> 7876.36s]  Door.
[7876.36s -> 7884.81s]  Where's your flute?
[7884.81s -> 7893.72s]  I have flutes.
[7896.78s -> 7898.54s]  Well, what's behind the door?
[7898.54s -> 7899.34s]  Is this a shortcut?
[7906.28s -> 7908.20s]  Yes, this is the door from earlier.
[7909.48s -> 7911.00s]  But this is not really a shortcut.
[7911.24s -> 7915.42s]  Because this, I just had an idol right here.
[7916.06s -> 7916.86s]  You know what I mean?
[7916.86s -> 7924.75s]  Why would I use that shortcut?
[7925.47s -> 7926.27s]  That's a chest.
[7932.49s -> 7933.61s]  It's like a coffin.
[7933.61s -> 7935.23s]  Is there a dead body in here?
[7936.19s -> 7936.99s]  Bunch of dead coins.
[7938.43s -> 7940.88s]  Well, I know I'm going back right now.
[7941.68s -> 7942.88s]  Oh, the lady wanted me to open that.
[7942.88s -> 7946.54s]  Right, okay.
[7946.54s -> 7947.66s]  What the hell is this?
[7950.60s -> 7951.40s]  Let's go.
[7959.12s -> 7960.40s]  I'd go back and talk to the lady.
[7960.40s -> 7961.52s]  Is she still in the same place?
[7962.24s -> 7963.28s]  Oh, she's you.
[7968.44s -> 7971.56s]  Well, that's a stab.
[7972.28s -> 7973.24s]  Don't embarrass me here.
[7975.68s -> 7976.64s]  Don't embarrass me here.
[7977.93s -> 7978.65s]  Standard enemy.
[7978.65s -> 7979.45s]  I knew that was coming.
[7980.17s -> 7981.21s]  You see me block that shit?
[7981.21s -> 7982.09s]  Didn't even know it was happening.
[7984.72s -> 7985.52s]  Okay, bye.
[7985.52s -> 7986.24s]  Goodbye.
[7986.24s -> 7987.28s]  I just want to talk to the lady.
[7989.02s -> 8011.16s]  Oh, I picked the worst fucking possible place to jump down.
[8011.16s -> 8013.84s]  Hey, I opened the door.
[8015.52s -> 8016.64s]  What item do I get?
[8016.64s -> 8017.20s]  Prayer bead.
[8027.52s -> 8028.08s]  I just did it.
[8030.16s -> 8030.88s]  Come on.
[8030.88s -> 8039.48s]  Well, now that I'm over here, let me just look around.
[8039.48s -> 8042.84s]  Because there's a bunch of shit that's underneath the water here.
[8042.84s -> 8049.79s]  I have to rest at an idol, didn't I?
[8050.35s -> 8053.48s]  I need to go.
[8053.48s -> 8056.04s]  All right, I have a lot of these scales.
[8056.04s -> 8057.32s]  I have at least eight.
[8057.32s -> 8059.52s]  I got to go back to the guy.
[8059.52s -> 8060.88s]  That weird guy in the bucket.
[8061.60s -> 8062.32s]  Remember that, dude?
[8084.09s -> 8088.33s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[8089.13s -> 8090.01s]  What this two?
[8090.01s -> 8091.77s]  Why is there one of these guys down here?
[8092.33s -> 8096.57s]  The fucking most hated enemy in the whole game is down here.
[8100.33s -> 8101.45s]  Just give me the item.
[8104.78s -> 8105.90s]  Why is he down here?
[8106.46s -> 8107.82s]  Are there two down here?
[8108.46s -> 8111.37s]  I just want everyone to be aware.
[8111.37s -> 8113.45s]  There's two headless in the water down here.
[8123.26s -> 8124.94s]  No, I'll never see the end of that content.
[8128.83s -> 8130.27s]  And I'm fine with that.
[8130.27s -> 8136.43s]  I will never get the 100% steam achievement.
[8137.37s -> 8137.77s]  That's fine.
[8138.57s -> 8141.07s]  I could give a shit lesson.
[8143.36s -> 8144.88s]  I can't believe these motherfuckers are down there.
[8153.69s -> 8154.09s]  Two?
[8154.09s -> 8154.97s]  There's two?
[8154.97s -> 8155.61s]  Headless?
[8155.61s -> 8155.85s]  Two?
[8156.65s -> 8158.76s]  Watch that be three.
[8158.76s -> 8163.64s]  Now it's down here?
[8163.64s -> 8164.36s]  Yep.
[8164.36s -> 8169.08s]  That's fucking crazy though.
[8169.80s -> 8177.31s]  They're really not messing around at all.
[8177.31s -> 8189.36s]  Okay, let's go back up.
[8190.00s -> 8195.39s]  I don't think you can drown.
[8204.41s -> 8208.99s]  Anybody else?
[8208.99s -> 8209.87s]  I've these guys have.
[8211.55s -> 8214.27s]  Well, I think that's not these are the treasure ones.
[8214.99s -> 8216.91s]  All right, I got all that's down here.
[8219.64s -> 8220.44s]  Really?
[8220.44s -> 8221.76s]  That's fine.
[8221.76s -> 8222.00s]  Just.
[8225.60s -> 8239.69s]  Ah, I almost had it here.
[8239.69s -> 8241.13s]  These carps are everywhere.
[8244.94s -> 8246.86s]  I need to go in to see what I can buy.
[8248.38s -> 8250.04s]  What a bait.
[8250.04s -> 8258.08s]  I'm here.
[8258.08s -> 8259.12s]  This is so huge.
[8259.12s -> 8262.00s]  It's like almost feels like a waste if I don't go get everything.
[8263.36s -> 8269.10s]  I'll forget it this way.
[8275.00s -> 8276.12s]  All right, I think that's good.
[8276.76s -> 8278.67s]  Maybe one or two more things under these.
[8287.52s -> 8288.16s]  Scrap.
[8288.16s -> 8288.40s]  Good.
[8289.52s -> 8295.21s]  It's just bees.
[8295.21s -> 8296.09s]  They can't get you under water.
[8306.25s -> 8307.85s]  All right, I'm done fishing.
[8307.85s -> 8309.61s]  I got pretty much all the things I wanted.
[8309.61s -> 8319.12s]  Look at all that stuff.
[8320.09s -> 8321.69s]  Even if I died, how much money do I have?
[8322.41s -> 8325.92s]  There's so much.
[8325.92s -> 8327.20s]  Look at these four items here.
[8334.12s -> 8335.24s]  What the fuck is under here?
[8338.62s -> 8339.74s]  Oh, it's a fish.
[8343.90s -> 8346.62s]  Okay, one, two, three, go.
[8353.72s -> 8354.20s]  Worth it.
[8363.28s -> 8363.52s]  Okay.
[8392.59s -> 8392.91s]  Sweet.
[8394.22s -> 8395.26s]  So now I've rested.
[8395.26s -> 8396.70s]  Now I should talk to the lady.
[8397.34s -> 8398.46s]  Is this what we're doing?
[8399.02s -> 8404.97s]  That's technically a rest.
[8405.69s -> 8408.36s]  Try that.
[8408.36s -> 8408.76s]  Let's see.
[8410.52s -> 8410.84s]  Lady.
[8411.64s -> 8413.13s]  Hello.
[8414.60s -> 8415.16s]  Front door.
[8415.16s -> 8415.72s]  Did you make it?
[8429.15s -> 8430.27s]  She's still standing over there.
[8443.47s -> 8444.27s]  That's not her.
[8444.27s -> 8445.55s]  That's just a piece of metal.
[8447.87s -> 8449.66s]  Did I run by her?
[8450.22s -> 8455.77s]  Did I just have the blinders on and go right by that lady?
[8455.77s -> 8456.41s]  Really?
[8456.41s -> 8457.61s]  Well, the room is dark.
[8457.61s -> 8459.13s]  It's a pitch black room.
[8459.13s -> 8461.69s]  And you're telling me that, like, I can't believe you didn't see the lady
[8461.69s -> 8462.97s]  that's hunched over in the corner.
[8463.53s -> 8468.57s]  You didn't even look?
[8468.57s -> 8471.44s]  Yeah, because I thought she was just, I don't know.
[8471.44s -> 8482.40s]  Okay, guys, why would I know that that was the case here?
[8483.04s -> 8486.86s]  You don't even, like, look at, okay.
[8487.66s -> 8489.31s]  Look at this room.
[8489.95s -> 8492.11s]  Those guys are just eating people.
[8492.11s -> 8493.79s]  So I'm just going to fucking go this way.
[8493.79s -> 8494.83s]  Like, I, what?
[8510.27s -> 8511.07s]  No, you're blind.
[8512.03s -> 8512.43s]  Shut up.
[8512.43s -> 8512.83s]  Shut up.
[8512.83s -> 8513.15s]  Shut up.
[8513.15s -> 8513.55s]  Shut up.
[8513.55s -> 8513.87s]  Shut up.
[8513.87s -> 8514.27s]  Shut up.
[8514.27s -> 8514.59s]  Shut up.
[8514.59s -> 8529.88s]  Shut up.
[8529.88s -> 8533.53s]  Um, was that one even worth doing?
[8534.41s -> 8535.93s]  You didn't give me anything.
[8535.93s -> 8540.36s]  Not even, like, a little icon popping up.
[8540.36s -> 8541.00s]  Prayer beads.
[8541.80s -> 8549.37s]  Now, let's turn in the seed.
[8554.81s -> 8557.69s]  Oh, she was stabbing herself in the stomach.
[8559.10s -> 8563.52s]  I thought she was stabbing the body over and over again.
[8566.72s -> 8572.30s]  I thought she was, she was stabbing herself in the chest.
[8572.30s -> 8572.94s]  She wasn't.
[8572.94s -> 8573.98s]  She was stabbing the body.
[8573.98s -> 8575.10s]  Well, then, never mind.
[8575.10s -> 8575.82s]  Where's my item?
[8576.70s -> 8586.68s]  How do you know that?
[8586.68s -> 8587.16s]  You didn't see.
[8597.44s -> 8599.47s]  Um, I gotta go.
[8599.47s -> 8600.99s]  That lady goes from place to place.
[8600.99s -> 8602.43s]  She teleports as much as I do.
[8603.15s -> 8604.59s]  How much money do I have?
[8604.59s -> 8607.10s]  I got cash now.
[8607.10s -> 8608.38s]  Hmm, wait.
[8614.84s -> 8615.79s]  What can I do?
[8615.79s -> 8616.75s]  Oh, here.
[8616.75s -> 8617.71s]  Dragon Spring sake.
[8617.71s -> 8618.35s]  Give me a story.
[8636.81s -> 8638.97s]  I've given all sake to this guy.
[8640.57s -> 8644.17s]  With Dogen, Emma would keep our cups filled.
[8644.17s -> 8645.77s]  Have you known Lady Emma for long?
[8649.34s -> 8651.50s]  I found her on a battlefield.
[8651.50s -> 8652.83s]  A field?
[8652.83s -> 8655.31s]  She crept up slowly towards me.
[8655.31s -> 8659.95s]  Her eyes fixed, unwavering on the rice I held in my hand.
[8659.95s -> 8660.75s]  I got some of that, too.
[8660.75s -> 8661.31s]  You want some?
[8662.19s -> 8663.63s]  So I gave it to her.
[8663.63s -> 8666.51s]  Then she just started following me.
[8666.51s -> 8675.20s]  After that, Ashina became a dangerous place for the both of us.
[8675.20s -> 8678.64s]  Around then, Dogen adopted her as his daughter.
[8680.60s -> 8681.24s]  Wait, what?
[8681.24s -> 8684.20s]  I suppose it didn't really matter where she ended up.
[8684.20s -> 8684.68s]  Hold on.
[8684.68s -> 8686.12s]  One thing's for sure.
[8686.12s -> 8690.76s]  So he's happier for the fact she wasn't raised by a shinobi.
[8691.88s -> 8702.89s]  I've never seen this guy's face.
[8703.93s -> 8716.17s]  That's the person that raised Emma.
[8716.17s -> 8717.93s]  And Emma said she was raised by monkeys.
[8725.71s -> 8726.27s]  Yeah.
[8726.27s -> 8730.51s]  Let's go and talk to Emma about her really elaborate,
[8730.51s -> 8732.27s]  truth-stretching Facebook post.
[8732.99s -> 8744.04s]  Yeah, I was raised by wolves.
[8744.04s -> 8745.96s]  Were you?
[8745.96s -> 8763.28s]  No, you don't get that.
[8763.28s -> 8763.76s]  It's mine.
[8763.76s -> 8766.00s]  Master Wolf, it looked your brow.
[8766.00s -> 8767.44s]  Yeah, we've heard about my brow.
[8767.44s -> 8767.94s]  Goodbye.
[8769.34s -> 8769.90s]  We're just up here.
[8769.90s -> 8771.26s]  I might as well just get some more dialogue.
[8771.26s -> 8771.98s]  Anything?
[8771.98s -> 8776.01s]  I hope he's all right.
[8776.01s -> 8778.97s]  Oh, are you unhurt?
[8778.97s -> 8779.95s]  My lord.
[8779.95s -> 8781.64s]  Ah, this is for you.
[8783.16s -> 8784.36s]  Sweet Rice Balls.
[8784.36s -> 8785.96s]  A sweet sticky rice ball made by Kuro.
[8786.52s -> 8790.68s]  Slowly grants medium vitality recovery and constant posture recovery over a time.
[8791.32s -> 8795.96s]  Wolf senses it was crafted with feelings of resolve and a reluctance to part ways.
[8796.60s -> 8798.01s]  Okay.
[8798.01s -> 8800.52s]  So this is just a big...
[8800.52s -> 8801.40s]  I need to use.
[8801.40s -> 8802.52s]  I will obtain them.
[8802.52s -> 8803.64s]  Heal over time.
[8803.64s -> 8804.44s]  Yes.
[8804.44s -> 8805.72s]  I'm counting on you, Wolf.
[8813.82s -> 8814.54s]  So many items.
[8818.11s -> 8819.31s]  Number held one and a one.
[8820.03s -> 8821.47s]  I think this is just a one and done.
[8822.11s -> 8832.60s]  Well, thanks for the extra gourd.
[8839.32s -> 8839.96s]  I'm ready.
[8841.48s -> 8842.28s]  Palace grounds.
[8845.20s -> 8846.16s]  Eat it in front of him.
[8846.16s -> 8846.96s]  Eat it in front of him.
[8847.52s -> 8849.12s]  No, I need that for like a boss fight.
[8850.00s -> 8852.22s]  I'm not just gonna eat that in front of him.
[8853.44s -> 8854.24s]  He's not a boss.
[8862.30s -> 8863.26s]  I gotta go back and...
[8864.64s -> 8868.48s]  I gotta upgrade my stuff.
[8868.48s -> 8870.64s]  I think I have enough materials to do another one.
[8871.44s -> 8878.76s]  Oh, the fat guy that wanted the flower.
[8878.76s -> 8879.16s]  You're right.
[8879.80s -> 8880.60s]  I have that too.
[8884.11s -> 8884.59s]  You need...
[8885.15s -> 8887.96s]  All right.
[8887.96s -> 8889.48s]  Can I upgrade anything here?
[8891.84s -> 8894.16s]  I need more stuff.
[8894.16s -> 8894.96s]  I can't do it yet.
[8895.68s -> 8898.81s]  I need three more gunpowder which I could buy
[8898.81s -> 8900.65s]  and one more of that...
[8900.65s -> 8901.69s]  Is that iron scrap?
[8901.69s -> 8902.01s]  Let me see.
[8902.01s -> 8902.65s]  Does he sell that?
[8915.44s -> 8916.32s]  He does.
[8916.32s -> 8917.36s]  Okay, I can get that.
[8918.08s -> 8919.34s]  So I need...
[8919.34s -> 8919.82s]  How many do I need?
[8919.82s -> 8921.02s]  I need three of these, right?
[8921.74s -> 8926.22s]  Let me use my coin purse things.
[8936.72s -> 8937.76s]  So one more of these.
[8938.40s -> 8940.48s]  And then was it two of these that I needed?
[8940.48s -> 8941.20s]  It's two, right?
[8941.76s -> 8943.28s]  Two and then 600.
[8943.28s -> 8944.00s]  How much money do I have?
[8951.32s -> 8956.35s]  So now I need to take three of these.
[8957.23s -> 8965.66s]  Let's go upgrade this and then get close to the ultimate firecracker.
[8966.70s -> 8973.98s]  That's a thousand.
[8973.98s -> 8974.30s]  Shit!
[8974.30s -> 8975.10s]  It's a thousand?
[8975.66s -> 8976.46s]  That's so much.
[8977.18s -> 8991.07s]  Come here.
[8994.14s -> 8997.61s]  So what does this axe do though?
[8997.61s -> 8998.65s]  Is it worth putting on?
[8998.65s -> 8999.69s]  This is pretty deep in here.
[9001.02s -> 9001.98s]  Sparking axe.
[9002.62s -> 9005.60s]  Attach percussion hammer to create flame.
[9008.16s -> 9010.72s]  So bring a flaming axe down from above to strike an enemy.
[9010.72s -> 9013.44s]  Destroy shields made of wood and creates a roar of flames on hit.
[9014.00s -> 9017.13s]  Cool.
[9017.13s -> 9017.45s]  All right.
[9018.17s -> 9019.95s]  And then purple fume spark.
[9020.59s -> 9022.52s]  Here we go.
[9024.78s -> 9026.46s]  Final tier has been revealed.
[9026.46s -> 9027.26s]  It is...
[9027.26s -> 9028.46s]  Oh, it looks like...
[9029.02s -> 9031.80s]  Lazulite axe.
[9032.44s -> 9037.79s]  The hefty Lazulite blade inflicts damage even on guarding enemies.
[9041.88s -> 9043.00s]  It's like the super...
[9043.96s -> 9044.68s]  Minecraft.
[9045.40s -> 9047.50s]  What's the stuff from Minecraft?
[9049.88s -> 9050.84s]  Blue Lapis?
[9050.84s -> 9051.40s]  What's it called?
[9051.88s -> 9056.68s]  What about...
[9056.68s -> 9057.48s]  What's it...
[9057.48s -> 9058.12s]  Oh, the fuck.
[9058.12s -> 9059.00s]  Oh, man.
[9059.80s -> 9062.70s]  Oh, that's actually not that cool.
[9062.70s -> 9063.58s]  Never mind.
[9063.58s -> 9065.37s]  It's all Lazulite.
[9065.37s -> 9066.17s]  No Lazulite...
[9067.37s -> 9068.67s]  Sparks?
[9069.31s -> 9073.28s]  Phantom Kunai.
[9073.28s -> 9074.48s]  All right.
[9074.48s -> 9077.76s]  So now we need two of an item I have not seen yet.
[9077.76s -> 9078.72s]  It's like some kind of salt.
[9080.32s -> 9081.60s]  And then 1500 bucks.
[9082.24s -> 9094.20s]  I'm going to get rid of this and put on the better axe.
[9095.77s -> 9096.73s]  Sparking axe.
[9097.45s -> 9099.56s]  Better shurikens and long spark.
[9100.51s -> 9101.31s]  Combat arts.
[9103.63s -> 9106.99s]  I don't really use this that often, but it's useful sometimes.
[9108.03s -> 9109.39s]  This is the stealth one.
[9111.85s -> 9112.41s]  I'll keep it.
[9113.05s -> 9121.00s]  Can I help you with your essay?
[9121.88s -> 9122.92s]  Hey there, friend.
[9123.72s -> 9124.76s]  I don't think you'd want me to do that.
[9126.81s -> 9127.61s]  I'm going to buy...
[9128.65s -> 9131.88s]  I'm going to buy one of the...
[9131.88s -> 9132.12s]  Yeah.
[9132.84s -> 9134.27s]  I feel like I'm going to need these.
[9138.03s -> 9138.35s]  All right.
[9138.35s -> 9138.83s]  It's time.
[9146.00s -> 9147.12s]  The question is where...
[9148.08s -> 9149.52s]  Where is the barrel guy?
[9152.46s -> 9153.74s]  He's over here.
[9154.46s -> 9155.48s]  I don't remember.
[9156.12s -> 9162.91s]  It's either here or...
[9163.55s -> 9164.51s]  I think it's here.
[9165.07s -> 9169.02s]  Because this is...
[9169.02s -> 9170.46s]  He was very early in the game.
[9174.38s -> 9175.50s]  How early was he, though?
[9176.38s -> 9177.10s]  Oh, here it is.
[9177.74s -> 9178.83s]  This is it, right?
[9181.66s -> 9182.86s]  Please help with the essay.
[9184.91s -> 9185.95s]  No, I don't...
[9185.95s -> 9186.43s]  I can't.
[9187.07s -> 9190.22s]  Is this it?
[9192.01s -> 9195.15s]  Yeah.
[9195.15s -> 9195.71s]  Help him!
[9196.59s -> 9197.55s]  You don't want my help.
[9197.55s -> 9198.19s]  You'll get an F.
[9198.83s -> 9200.96s]  You know what?
[9200.96s -> 9201.76s]  No, I'll help.
[9201.76s -> 9202.00s]  Fine.
[9202.00s -> 9202.96s]  You want me to help you?
[9202.96s -> 9203.52s]  Listen.
[9203.52s -> 9203.92s]  Here you go.
[9203.92s -> 9204.72s]  Here's the advice.
[9206.09s -> 9207.69s]  Eat a good breakfast tomorrow.
[9208.33s -> 9213.69s]  I'm talking like two eggs, maybe one piece of bacon, some fruit, like a peach.
[9215.02s -> 9217.18s]  Sit on the couch for like 30 minutes, digest it,
[9217.18s -> 9219.34s]  make it get into your bloodstream, into your brain for brain power.
[9220.70s -> 9222.62s]  And then start.
[9223.26s -> 9225.56s]  That's my advice.
[9227.53s -> 9229.45s]  You need good brain power to do anything.
[9231.08s -> 9232.04s]  Like, for instance, today.
[9232.76s -> 9234.36s]  Good quality brain power food.
[9234.36s -> 9235.80s]  You've got to feed your brain.
[9235.80s -> 9237.88s]  And your brain is the most important organ.
[9238.75s -> 9241.47s]  It takes from any of the foods you eat.
[9241.47s -> 9242.99s]  How do you think you can, like, think?
[9242.99s -> 9244.91s]  Is you need good, high quality foods.
[9245.63s -> 9252.17s]  So I went to Burger King today and had a double whopper and two large fries.
[9252.73s -> 9255.04s]  I almost shit my pants before the stream.
[9255.04s -> 9269.60s]  I had so much time, I just fucked it up.
[9269.60s -> 9270.64s]  Oh, I need to look around.
[9271.84s -> 9275.28s]  Because there's got to be something under here.
[9275.28s -> 9276.72s]  Why would there not be something here?
[9277.52s -> 9278.72s]  The essay's due tonight.
[9282.30s -> 9283.98s]  Well, why did you wait so long?
[9285.88s -> 9288.04s]  You should have, you should have done it earlier.
[9292.25s -> 9295.52s]  All right.
[9295.52s -> 9296.16s]  Purchase items.
[9296.16s -> 9300.35s]  So I have 13 floating passage.
[9300.35s -> 9302.91s]  This is five, seven for the mask fragment.
[9305.05s -> 9306.09s]  Divine grass.
[9306.09s -> 9307.21s]  Does he have more than one of these?
[9307.77s -> 9309.05s]  I'll just buy 13 of these.
[9309.69s -> 9320.67s]  Skill unlocked upon requiring this item.
[9320.67s -> 9322.51s]  Unleash attacks in a flowing dance-like form,
[9322.51s -> 9324.59s]  overwhelming enemies in a furore of graceful aggression.
[9325.23s -> 9329.37s]  This technique belongs to the Ashina Sword School,
[9329.37s -> 9331.77s]  though it has been deemed heretical due to its foreign origin.
[9333.66s -> 9334.46s]  Red gourd.
[9338.27s -> 9341.23s]  Reduces burn buildup and slightly increases burn resistance.
[9341.87s -> 9346.00s]  It cannot heal the burn status abnormality, however.
[9346.00s -> 9346.50s]  Okay.
[9347.20s -> 9348.41s]  That sounds pretty good.
[9348.41s -> 9349.85s]  So this is just another drink.
[9349.85s -> 9351.29s]  How many, does he get five uses?
[9352.17s -> 9354.06s]  Oh, damn.
[9354.78s -> 9356.81s]  Give me that.
[9358.73s -> 9360.17s]  There's like three of these pieces.
[9360.17s -> 9361.69s]  I don't know if I'm going to be able to get all these.
[9362.73s -> 9364.17s]  I'm not sure if it's worth buying this.
[9364.89s -> 9370.91s]  How many pieces do I need?
[9370.91s -> 9372.27s]  Like two, three, four?
[9375.37s -> 9376.73s]  Mask fragment right.
[9376.73s -> 9377.77s]  I mean, I have the money.
[9379.45s -> 9380.49s]  There are three pieces.
[9382.48s -> 9383.36s]  It's really useful,
[9383.36s -> 9385.92s]  but I don't even know where to even start for that.
[9385.92s -> 9386.72s]  I know I saw the other one,
[9386.72s -> 9388.08s]  but there's apparently another one somewhere.
[9388.80s -> 9394.48s]  How many of these does he have?
[9395.12s -> 9398.12s]  He only had one.
[9398.12s -> 9398.36s]  Okay.
[9398.36s -> 9399.48s]  Well, that's worth it.
[9399.48s -> 9407.53s]  Well, I got the useful stuff.
[9409.80s -> 9411.08s]  I know where it is, right?
[9412.80s -> 9413.60s]  I know it's here.
[9422.20s -> 9432.22s]  You want to be the fish?
[9432.22s -> 9432.86s]  Holy shit.
[9433.58s -> 9434.86s]  Great Canadian fuck club.
[9434.86s -> 9436.06s]  20 community subs.
[9439.39s -> 9441.39s]  20 community subs from great Canadian.
[9441.95s -> 9442.67s]  Oh my God.
[9444.83s -> 9445.95s]  That's a shitload of subs.
[9449.84s -> 9451.52s]  That is a shitload of subs.
[9456.54s -> 9456.94s]  Thank you.
[9457.58s -> 9467.02s]  Damn.
[9468.57s -> 9469.69s]  What a great Canadian.
[9470.33s -> 9478.49s]  So you go, that's actually really good.
[9481.48s -> 9482.68s]  That comes up quick.
[9486.49s -> 9487.69s]  I like this better than the other one.
[9487.69s -> 9489.13s]  And then the other thing I have is slow.
[9490.01s -> 9495.50s]  You could like do a dodge or like dodge around and bang and then get out.
[9496.14s -> 9500.30s]  Maybe I'll try it.
[9502.04s -> 9502.84s]  Hey there.
[9502.84s -> 9503.80s]  Want me to just kill this guy?
[9503.80s -> 9506.35s]  No, I'm just kidding.
[9506.35s -> 9506.59s]  Cool.
[9506.59s -> 9508.03s]  So I have the gourd now.
[9508.03s -> 9508.43s]  Let's see.
[9509.15s -> 9514.88s]  Reduces burn buildup.
[9517.85s -> 9521.77s]  So I feel like I should have had this a long time ago.
[9521.77s -> 9524.41s]  There's been at least three or four bosses that were fire based.
[9525.52s -> 9527.60s]  I hope this is still worth using
[9527.60s -> 9529.04s]  because it took me a long time to get it.
[9541.02s -> 9542.46s]  717 subs.
[9546.12s -> 9546.36s]  Yeah.
[9547.00s -> 9553.69s]  You guys remember when we were talking like a few months ago
[9553.69s -> 9555.69s]  or two months ago, three months ago about crossing
[9556.83s -> 9559.71s]  like the thousands of subs that are on this channel?
[9562.09s -> 9562.33s]  Yeah.
[9564.56s -> 9568.48s]  Great Canadian has and had more than that I think earlier.
[9575.98s -> 9577.18s]  That's a shitload of money.
[9577.82s -> 9581.72s]  All right, let's go.
[9581.72s -> 9582.28s]  Time to fight.
[9584.43s -> 9585.95s]  No one actually is subscribing.
[9585.95s -> 9587.79s]  He's just giving everybody subs.
[9590.35s -> 9592.11s]  I never wouldn't see that surprising.
[9592.83s -> 9595.18s]  And here comes Kairatobi with 10.
[9595.82s -> 9599.66s]  217 from Kairatobi.
[9599.66s -> 9602.14s]  A lot of 17, 717, 217.
[9602.86s -> 9604.19s]  Interesting.
[9604.19s -> 9616.80s]  Got any tips for the Genichiro fight?
[9617.44s -> 9620.16s]  I'm about to lose my fucking mind with how hard it is.
[9621.79s -> 9624.70s]  Um, honestly with...
[9624.70s -> 9626.94s]  Okay, Splarg, five community subs.
[9626.94s -> 9627.66s]  Thanks a lot.
[9627.66s -> 9628.30s]  Thank you, Splarg.
[9630.72s -> 9633.60s]  I'll tell you with all the fights that are on the boss platform,
[9635.72s -> 9635.96s]  it's...
[9637.88s -> 9638.36s]  Everyone's...
[9639.96s -> 9642.12s]  I've read a lot of people talking about
[9642.12s -> 9644.36s]  be aggressive, aggressive, aggressive, going and go hard.
[9645.64s -> 9646.52s]  I'm not sure I agree.
[9647.64s -> 9649.08s]  At least for the fights that are up there.
[9650.56s -> 9654.08s]  I like to take a more parry, learn their moves
[9654.08s -> 9656.64s]  and just kind of block, block, block, parry, parry, parry, parry.
[9657.88s -> 9660.52s]  Sometimes when you go in, you can cross your brain up
[9660.52s -> 9663.40s]  with whether to swing or to block or to swing or to parry.
[9664.28s -> 9670.03s]  The deflect is so useful and it's so good
[9671.61s -> 9673.61s]  that it's, I think, at least on some of the fights
[9673.61s -> 9675.05s]  that when you fight a guy with a sword
[9675.93s -> 9679.45s]  to try and get the parry down for the moves.
[9680.09s -> 9681.61s]  And then there was another thing that...
[9681.61s -> 9683.13s]  Bebraham gave 10 community subs.
[9685.45s -> 9689.93s]  10 subs, 20 subs, 5 subs, 25, 5, 5, 10, 5, 5 from Freudian Weapon.
[9694.30s -> 9696.38s]  You guys trying to put me in another tax bracket?
[9696.94s -> 9698.09s]  Holy shit.
[9701.50s -> 9705.61s]  Here's the door.
[9708.43s -> 9710.59s]  Thank you for the tons of community subs, guys.
[9711.23s -> 9712.91s]  I have a feeling this is a boss.
[9712.91s -> 9713.87s]  Let's see what it is.
[9713.87s -> 9718.28s]  Maybe not.
[9718.28s -> 9725.71s]  Another zone.
[9725.71s -> 9726.67s]  I'm going to sneeze, I think.
[9728.40s -> 9732.62s]  Yeah, but ooh, item.
[9732.62s -> 9734.00s]  Just get it.
[9734.64s -> 9735.36s]  It is right here.
[9736.00s -> 9745.98s]  I need to use these.
[9746.86s -> 9749.90s]  I just never have the opportunity to go and do it.
[9750.78s -> 9752.91s]  Dude, if I could make a script.
[9752.91s -> 9757.05s]  Well, if I could have a script
[9757.05s -> 9759.61s]  that would automatically activate one of those.
[9759.61s -> 9761.61s]  Every like 30 minutes, I would have it work.
[9762.33s -> 9765.98s]  It's something like hanging on the tree.
[9766.78s -> 9772.56s]  What is it?
[9776.52s -> 9778.20s]  Oh, it's just a lizard.
[9782.91s -> 9783.87s]  Thank you, Jiber.
[9784.83s -> 9785.55s]  Jiber is 7.
[9786.97s -> 9788.01s]  5 more community subs.
[9790.44s -> 9792.52s]  Sub train, after sub train, after sub train.
[9792.52s -> 9793.40s]  Sub, sub, subs.
[9794.04s -> 9798.09s]  I like this little spot, though.
[9798.73s -> 9801.90s]  He was just chilling.
[9801.90s -> 9803.98s]  Yeah, but look, his anger meter is there.
[9812.00s -> 9812.88s]  Maybe?
[9812.88s -> 9815.07s]  Because back up here is the...
[9815.79s -> 9821.50s]  No, I guess we're going this way.
[9821.50s -> 9823.66s]  Dear Meaty, 5 community subs.
[9826.46s -> 9827.42s]  Thank you, guys.
[9827.42s -> 9827.98s]  5 more.
[9832.76s -> 9833.88s]  Looks like I can get up there.
[9843.02s -> 9845.10s]  So many subscriptions.
[9845.74s -> 9855.12s]  Come on, I can't reach the...
[9855.12s -> 9856.32s]  Jump from tree to tree, maybe?
[9857.69s -> 9858.97s]  The Zinger Slinger.
[9858.97s -> 9860.09s]  5 community subs.
[9861.84s -> 9863.76s]  Subs, subs, even more of them.
[9864.97s -> 9866.49s]  They just don't stop coming.
[9867.13s -> 9868.83s]  They are just here.
[9869.71s -> 9870.21s]  Forever.
[9871.29s -> 9872.33s]  Sub train.
[9872.33s -> 9872.83s]  Forever.
[9874.11s -> 9875.07s]  Thank you, Zinger Slinger.
[9877.52s -> 9878.02s]  All right.
[9878.64s -> 9881.53s]  Is that an enemy or is it just somebody angry
[9881.53s -> 9882.25s]  that I'm coming up here?
[9882.81s -> 9890.73s]  No, somebody's just powering up.
[9890.81s -> 9891.93s]  Spliceable Spleen.
[9891.93s -> 9893.05s]  5 community subs.
[9894.01s -> 9894.51s]  Thank you.
[9898.04s -> 9898.54s]  Subs.
[9899.61s -> 9900.41s]  Holy shit.
[9900.41s -> 9900.91s]  All right.
[9903.07s -> 9904.35s]  That's too many.
[9904.35s -> 9907.07s]  Too, too many lightning bolts.
[9908.81s -> 9909.61s]  You didn't even do it.
[9913.63s -> 9914.13s]  God.
[9915.50s -> 9916.30s]  No, stop!
[9916.30s -> 9916.80s]  Just...
[9920.00s -> 9920.96s]  I gotta pull you down here.
[9932.60s -> 9933.10s]  Get it!
[9933.80s -> 9934.84s]  Oh my God!
[9934.84s -> 9935.34s]  Die!
[9937.92s -> 9941.85s]  Honest to God.
[9941.85s -> 9943.13s]  I can't believe that guy's still alive.
[9943.93s -> 9944.65s]  I'm shocked.
[9951.63s -> 9952.27s]  Damn it!
[9952.27s -> 9952.77s]  No!
[9962.88s -> 9963.44s]  Damn it.
[9963.44s -> 9964.16s]  Oh my goodness.
[9964.16s -> 9965.44s]  These guys are so irritating.
[9966.56s -> 9967.52s]  Uh, Krusty!
[9967.52s -> 9969.12s]  Thank you, Krusty, for 5 community subs.
[9970.16s -> 9973.29s]  All right, look at the health.
[9973.29s -> 9974.01s]  Like, give me a break.
[9976.20s -> 9977.64s]  What are you doing?
[9977.64s -> 9982.17s]  I feel like I'm not doing
[9982.17s -> 9983.85s]  even remotely enough damage right now.
[9983.85s -> 9984.25s]  How?
[9984.25s -> 9985.93s]  I just upgraded my sword.
[9985.93s -> 9986.43s]  What?
[9987.84s -> 9988.80s]  That feels so wrong.
[9997.87s -> 9998.59s]  I, I even...
[10004.04s -> 10004.92s]  Just kidding.
[10004.92s -> 10007.00s]  Fucking God, come on!
[10008.04s -> 10008.54s]  Why?
[10011.21s -> 10012.65s]  I'm not using the other resurrect.
[10015.82s -> 10016.32s]  Huh?
[10026.70s -> 10028.04s]  I probably didn't do, like...
[10028.70s -> 10029.90s]  80% of my health.
[10030.46s -> 10035.45s]  All right, let's go.
[10049.55s -> 10051.07s]  Just hard to deal with more than one enemy.
[10051.71s -> 10053.84s]  When you fight more than one person, you just...
[10054.97s -> 10056.01s]  Just fucking...
[10056.01s -> 10056.51s]  Chaos.
[10057.21s -> 10061.68s]  Can I go around this way and kill one of them?
[10062.24s -> 10064.32s]  Deal with two of them.
[10064.32s -> 10065.52s]  Oh, three of them at the same time.
[10065.52s -> 10067.12s]  It's just, that's not gonna happen.
[10070.08s -> 10070.72s]  I guess not.
[10070.72s -> 10071.76s]  You just have to do it.
[10072.56s -> 10082.86s]  Well, I got none of these.
[10106.22s -> 10106.72s]  Fuck.
[10106.72s -> 10112.42s]  As long as we're far enough away.
[10112.42s -> 10138.77s]  Damn it!
[10138.77s -> 10140.77s]  This is such a massive delay.
[10140.77s -> 10146.95s]  WHAAAAAAAT?
[10223.80s -> 10225.80s]  Wait, hold on. Let me read the message here.
[10225.80s -> 10228.90s]  Try backstab.
[10228.90s -> 10229.90s]  Hull.
[10230.90s -> 10232.20s]  Right? Right, guys?
[10232.20s -> 10235.27s]  Oh, they're dead. Nevermind.
[10235.27s -> 10238.37s]  Sorry, nevermind.
[10238.37s -> 10239.61s]  Should I pray?
[10239.61s -> 10251.28s]  Right?
[10251.28s -> 10252.28s]  This is Dark Souls game.
[10252.28s -> 10254.28s]  You have to write the funny line everywhere.
[10254.28s -> 10255.28s]  Behind every enemy.
[10255.28s -> 10256.28s]  Behind every person.
[10256.28s -> 10264.98s]  Is there an enemy that's facing over a balcony?
[10264.98s -> 10266.98s]  There's just a standard enemy.
[10266.98s -> 10268.22s]  It better be there.
[10268.22s -> 10287.12s]  This is coming from the man who talks about diapers and puke every stream.
[10288.87s -> 10289.87s]  Hold on.
[10289.87s -> 10290.87s]  Just wait.
[10290.87s -> 10292.87s]  I gotta defend myself on that one.
[10292.87s -> 10299.50s]  I'm not writing it down and putting it in front of every enemy.
[10299.50s -> 10302.81s]  I don't go behind every enemy in the game and say,
[10302.81s -> 10303.81s]  Look at his diaper!
[10303.81s -> 10306.26s]  That...
[10306.26s -> 10307.26s]  Every enemy?
[10307.26s -> 10308.26s]  Every NPC?
[10308.26s -> 10312.06s]  I don't do that.
[10312.06s -> 10314.56s]  Alright, what the hell is this?
[10314.56s -> 10315.56s]  This is like...
[10315.56s -> 10322.00s]  This is clearly a boss.
[10322.00s -> 10330.00s]  Old Dragons of the...
[10330.00s -> 10334.20s]  Oh god, they're just gonna cough on me?
[10334.20s -> 10337.46s]  No, no, it's like being at PAX!
[10337.46s -> 10338.46s]  I don't want to be...
[10338.46s -> 10340.46s]  It's like going on an airplane!
[10348.02s -> 10352.80s]  Well, okay.
[10352.80s -> 10354.80s]  They're just like puking.
[10354.80s -> 10357.80s]  Alright, let's go ahead and put on the antidote.
[10363.65s -> 10375.25s]  Yeah, From Software has such a massive, massive, massive hard-on
[10375.25s -> 10379.25s]  for fight like a hundred of the same enemy in a boss fight.
[10379.25s -> 10380.25s]  Really.
[10380.25s -> 10383.96s]  Bloodborne, it was the spider boss.
[10383.96s -> 10386.96s]  Deacons, like why do they have to do this?
[10386.96s -> 10397.99s]  I wonder if there's something like...
[10397.99s -> 10398.99s]  Let's see, hold on.
[10398.99s -> 10401.38s]  I mean that's kind of...
[10401.38s -> 10402.38s]  That actually is pretty effective.
[10402.38s -> 10403.38s]  Then I'm gonna get poisoned.
[10403.38s -> 10405.56s]  What else do I have here?
[10405.56s -> 10408.63s]  What the fuck?
[10408.63s -> 10410.63s]  Oh no.
[10410.63s -> 10414.94s]  Do I fight it?
[10414.94s -> 10416.94s]  Do I fight the tree?
[10416.94s -> 10417.94s]  I don't know.
[10417.94s -> 10424.73s]  Ooh, that's actually pretty good.
[10424.73s -> 10431.73s]  I'm poisoned.
[10431.73s -> 10444.87s]  No, it's not worth it.
[10444.87s -> 10446.87s]  It takes too long.
[10446.87s -> 10457.24s]  Can I like hurt the tree?
[10457.24s -> 10459.25s]  No.
[10459.25s -> 10465.26s]  Let's go back bread and butter.
[10465.26s -> 10487.30s]  Use axe on tree like in Minecraft.
[10487.30s -> 10501.57s]  Wait, what's this?
[10501.57s -> 10503.13s]  That was a different one.
[10503.13s -> 10512.47s]  That one's different.
[10512.47s -> 10515.48s]  Is this just the deacons?
[10515.48s -> 10542.49s]  What was that?
[10542.49s -> 10561.20s]  All right, I can re-come out this time.
[10561.20s -> 10563.20s]  This can't be it, right?
[10563.20s -> 10578.94s]  I mean that's satisfying to do, but...
[10578.94s -> 10591.36s]  All right, that's it.
[10591.36s -> 10592.36s]  Is that it?
[10592.36s -> 10596.07s]  No, of course that's not it.
[10596.07s -> 10602.88s]  Oh, I can't wait to fight the real boss
[10602.88s -> 10604.88s]  and then have to do that, what I just did again
[10604.88s -> 10605.88s]  because I'm gonna get killed by the guy
[10605.88s -> 10607.88s]  that swings like 300 times a second
[10607.88s -> 10610.88s]  because he's like one of the later game bosses.
[10610.88s -> 10612.89s]  They're gonna all transform
[10612.89s -> 10614.89s]  into a fucking monster or something.
[10614.89s -> 10628.82s]  Let's see if I can get this done.
[10628.82s -> 10632.02s]  I have to take a break after this.
[10632.02s -> 10633.02s]  I'm gonna lose.
[10633.02s -> 10635.02s]  I gotta grab a little drink.
[10635.02s -> 10643.08s]  Man, that's so cool.
[10643.08s -> 10645.26s]  Wow.
[10645.26s -> 10651.57s]  Oh, divine dragon.
[10651.57s -> 10661.46s]  Okay, so that's a sweep.
[10661.46s -> 10663.46s]  That's just a big sweep.
[10663.46s -> 10665.60s]  What else do you do?
[10665.60s -> 10667.60s]  I guess I can go like this.
[10668.60s -> 10670.90s]  Ow, that hurt.
[10670.90s -> 10681.91s]  Okay, he strikes you with lightning
[10681.91s -> 10682.91s]  and then you strike...
[10682.91s -> 10684.91s]  Oh, God, where's he going?
[10684.91s -> 10687.91s]  Oh, my God, what the fuck is he doing?
[10687.91s -> 10690.69s]  Wow.
[10690.69s -> 10696.38s]  Wow, this is really cool.
[10696.38s -> 10702.10s]  I love this fight.
[10702.10s -> 10705.10s]  Holy shit, that hurt.
[10705.10s -> 10710.67s]  I'm gonna die.
[10710.67s -> 10720.34s]  Bang.
[10720.34s -> 10721.34s]  Oh, fuck.
[10721.34s -> 10727.70s]  I gotta wait longer than that.
[10727.70s -> 10731.95s]  Damn.
[10731.95s -> 10734.95s]  Maybe I should just jump around to the trees.
[10734.95s -> 10746.34s]  I can't.
[10746.34s -> 10747.90s]  You wait.
[10747.90s -> 10749.90s]  I can parry the sword.
[10749.90s -> 10751.90s]  I'm so far away.
[10751.90s -> 10759.71s]  That seems like I shouldn't be able to do that.
[10759.71s -> 10777.30s]  It's kind of delayed.
[10777.30s -> 10780.58s]  Do again?
[10780.58s -> 10783.87s]  Lightning?
[10783.87s -> 10784.87s]  Nope.
[10784.87s -> 10785.87s]  Grab it, grab it.
[10785.87s -> 10796.58s]  Aw.
[10796.58s -> 10800.06s]  All right.
[10800.06s -> 10801.06s]  Fuck.
[10801.06s -> 10808.77s]  I'm dead.
[10808.77s -> 10817.66s]  When does he do the electricity?
[10817.66s -> 10818.66s]  All right.
[10818.66s -> 10822.08s]  Well, hold on.
[10822.08s -> 10823.08s]  Okay.
[10823.08s -> 10824.08s]  Oh, right.
[10824.08s -> 10828.08s]  Okay, so let's just do that again.
[10832.33s -> 10836.33s]  All right, well, that makes it a little easier knowing that.
[10836.33s -> 10837.33s]  Okay.
[10837.33s -> 10842.28s]  Oh, God.
[10842.28s -> 10843.28s]  Don't die here.
[10843.28s -> 10850.00s]  Give me some more trees.
[10850.00s -> 10864.17s]  Tree, give me a tree.
[10864.17s -> 10865.17s]  Holy shit.
[10865.17s -> 10866.17s]  What the fuck?
[10866.17s -> 10868.05s]  What the fuck?
[10868.05s -> 10872.82s]  Where's the trees?
[10872.82s -> 10881.02s]  Oh, my God.
[10881.02s -> 10882.02s]  So all right.
[10882.02s -> 10884.02s]  That fight is a total joke.
[10884.02s -> 10888.02s]  And then he randomly just goes crazy for like 10 straight seconds.
[10888.02s -> 10890.47s]  Okay.
[10890.47s -> 10892.47s]  Well, now we're going to do the deacons again.
[10892.47s -> 10902.26s]  It's just a cinematic boss.
[10902.26s -> 10904.26s]  Died to the cinematic boss.
[10904.26s -> 10906.26s]  Whoa, who gives a shit?
[10906.26s -> 10908.26s]  It's the first time I've even seen it.
[10908.26s -> 10910.82s]  I can't believe you didn't beat that.
[10910.82s -> 10913.82s]  I mean, like, this is the first time you've ever seen this.
[10913.82s -> 10914.82s]  How did you not know that?
[10914.82s -> 10915.82s]  I can't...
[10915.82s -> 10918.82s]  No, you should have known that you need to jump on the tree.
[10918.82s -> 10922.13s]  Were you, like, looking at the boss and how cool the boss was?
[10922.13s -> 10926.13s]  You didn't beat it the first fucking try like you did the last three bosses?
[10926.13s -> 10927.13s]  I'm something.
[10927.13s -> 10943.79s]  No, do it.
[10943.79s -> 10944.79s]  Why did I fall?
[10944.79s -> 10955.53s]  Oh, it disappeared.
[10955.53s -> 10973.66s]  Hi.
[10973.66s -> 10979.13s]  All right.
[10979.13s -> 10980.13s]  Let's do this again.
[10980.13s -> 10987.09s]  That's really not even that bad of a deal.
[10987.09s -> 10988.09s]  Hi, King.
[10988.09s -> 10989.09s]  Thanks for the 10 community subs.
[10989.09s -> 10991.80s]  All right.
[10991.80s -> 10993.62s]  Here we go.
[10993.62s -> 10994.62s]  Lightning trees.
[10994.62s -> 10995.62s]  And then he goes crazy.
[10995.62s -> 10996.62s]  This is so cool.
[10996.62s -> 10997.62s]  It really is like an awesome fight.
[10997.62s -> 11004.55s]  That still hit me.
[11004.55s -> 11005.55s]  All right.
[11005.55s -> 11009.86s]  Which one's lit up?
[11009.86s -> 11011.86s]  None of them so far?
[11011.86s -> 11025.65s]  Fly around.
[11025.65s -> 11028.81s]  Which one?
[11028.81s -> 11034.70s]  He's going to knock me back?
[11034.70s -> 11042.98s]  Hello.
[11042.98s -> 11044.66s]  Hello.
[11044.66s -> 11046.54s]  I see it.
[11047.54s -> 11065.90s]  What the fuck are you doing, game?
[11065.90s -> 11066.90s]  Oh, shit.
[11066.90s -> 11067.90s]  He was ducking.
[11067.90s -> 11078.01s]  I thought I was just going to go right into his body.
[11078.01s -> 11083.22s]  All right.
[11083.22s -> 11084.22s]  Here we go.
[11084.22s -> 11086.80s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[11086.80s -> 11087.80s]  Just lock on.
[11087.80s -> 11088.80s]  I don't matter.
[11088.80s -> 11097.85s]  He can go under.
[11097.85s -> 11098.85s]  All right.
[11098.85s -> 11110.39s]  Go.
[11110.39s -> 11119.68s]  Any more?
[11119.68s -> 11120.68s]  Over there.
[11120.68s -> 11121.68s]  Here we go.
[11121.68s -> 11122.68s]  Time for him to do a bunch of stupid moves.
[11122.68s -> 11127.50s]  Let's do it.
[11127.50s -> 11128.50s]  Come on.
[11128.50s -> 11151.81s]  What do you got?
[11151.81s -> 11152.81s]  Oh, I was trying to.
[11152.81s -> 11154.43s]  I was trying to parry.
[11154.43s -> 11155.43s]  Fuck, man.
[11155.43s -> 11156.67s]  He's not.
[11156.67s -> 11157.67s]  All right.
[11157.67s -> 11161.66s]  Here are the trees.
[11161.66s -> 11162.66s]  I win.
[11162.66s -> 11163.66s]  What?
[11163.66s -> 11169.77s]  Whoa.
[11169.77s -> 11171.33s]  You're alive?
[11171.33s -> 11172.33s]  What's that?
[11172.33s -> 11175.23s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[11175.23s -> 11177.82s]  Get it.
[11177.82s -> 11178.82s]  Get it.
[11178.82s -> 11179.82s]  Get it.
[11179.82s -> 11180.82s]  Grab it.
[11180.82s -> 11181.82s]  Grab it.
[11181.82s -> 11185.36s]  Do it.
[11185.36s -> 11186.36s]  Grab it.
[11186.36s -> 11196.75s]  Grab it.
[11196.75s -> 11197.75s]  Oh, shit.
[11197.75s -> 11198.75s]  Okay.
[11198.75s -> 11206.78s]  That was really cool.
[11206.78s -> 11212.94s]  Gracious gift of tears.
[11212.94s -> 11213.94s]  I kind of feel bad.
[11213.94s -> 11214.94s]  Well, that was definitely the coolest boss fight.
[11214.94s -> 11219.32s]  Divine dragon.
[11219.32s -> 11223.84s]  Commiem with the sculptor's idol and confront memories of a battle to permanently increase
[11223.84s -> 11224.84s]  attack power.
[11224.84s -> 11233.18s]  Tutorial boss.
[11233.18s -> 11234.18s]  Give it a rest.
[11234.94s -> 11244.78s]  Give it a rest.
[11244.78s -> 11248.59s]  Like, give it a rest.
[11248.59s -> 11249.59s]  Like this guy.
[11249.59s -> 11254.66s]  Lord Isshin, what happened?
[11254.66s -> 11255.66s]  That's impossible.
[11255.66s -> 11256.66s]  I've been curing it.
[11256.66s -> 11258.03s]  I see.
[11258.03s -> 11265.75s]  I'm sure you, the central forces, have taken this opportunity.
[11265.75s -> 11272.70s]  The key to the secret passage that leads out of Isshin Castle.
[11272.70s -> 11276.94s]  The secret passage can be found at the end of the moat in the Isshin Reservoir,
[11276.94s -> 11282.03s]  not far from the Moonview Tower.
[11282.23s -> 11285.23s]  So this is the same place we were at the beginning of the game?
[11285.23s -> 11288.47s]  Yes, Master Wolf.
[11288.47s -> 11293.47s]  The secret passage can be found along the moat in the Ashina Reservoir,
[11293.47s -> 11296.48s]  not far from the Moon.
[11296.48s -> 11300.48s]  Lord Kuro escaped the castle through that secret passage
[11300.48s -> 11304.48s]  and should be waiting for you in the Silvergrass Field.
[11304.48s -> 11305.48s]  Understood.
[11305.48s -> 11310.81s]  The Nightjar have left smoke signals under Lord Isshin's orders.
[11310.81s -> 11312.98s]  The smoke should lead the way to order.
[11313.18s -> 11318.61s]  Okay, so I have the key.
[11318.61s -> 11321.77s]  Cool.
[11321.77s -> 11322.77s]  Tutorial complete.
[11322.77s -> 11323.77s]  Now the new...
[11323.77s -> 11324.77s]  All right.
[11324.77s -> 11329.35s]  Anyone that says the word tutorial and boss in the same sentence?
[11329.35s -> 11332.35s]  I mean, you can write that, but if there's an LOL there,
[11332.35s -> 11335.30s]  or like a Kappa or something,
[11335.30s -> 11337.30s]  I want them permanently removed from my chat room.
[11337.30s -> 11342.73s]  If I see tutorial boss and only if there's an LOL in there too,
[11342.73s -> 11344.73s]  because you could just write,
[11344.73s -> 11347.97s]  hey, I died on the tutorial boss.
[11347.97s -> 11348.97s]  Right?
[11348.97s -> 11351.59s]  Or, the tutorial was really fun.
[11351.79s -> 11354.79s]  I really enjoyed fighting against the guy that couldn't die,
[11354.79s -> 11356.79s]  but the first boss was tough, right?
[11356.79s -> 11358.35s]  That's okay.
[11358.35s -> 11361.35s]  But tutorial boss LUL, or tutorial boss,
[11361.35s -> 11362.35s]  like, fuck you.
[11362.35s -> 11363.53s]  You're gone.
[11363.53s -> 11368.29s]  Forever.
[11368.29s -> 11369.29s]  All right, I gotta pee.
[11369.29s -> 11372.00s]  I'm very fat.
[11372.00s -> 11373.00s]  I gotta pee.
[11483.36s -> 11486.33s]  Look here, my logs.
[11489.66s -> 11490.66s]  Okay.
[11490.66s -> 11492.02s]  So there are...
[11492.02s -> 11495.02s]  There's over 2,700 people here.
[11495.02s -> 11498.02s]  Just checking up and doing a search keyword,
[11498.22s -> 11501.66s]  Control F for tutorial boss LUL.
[11501.66s -> 11502.66s]  Okay.
[11502.66s -> 11508.29s]  So 1,700 people are gone when I press Enter.
[11512.92s -> 11521.98s]  So I'm willing to accept an apology before I press this.
[11521.98s -> 11523.98s]  I'm sitting right here.
[11523.98s -> 11528.23s]  Sorry.
[11528.23s -> 11529.23s]  Somebody said not sorry.
[11529.23s -> 11535.91s]  Okay.
[11535.91s -> 11536.91s]  No LOL.
[11536.91s -> 11537.91s]  You suck.
[11537.91s -> 11538.91s]  Tutorial boss.
[11538.91s -> 11540.41s]  Coward.
[11540.41s -> 11541.65s]  Do it.
[11541.65s -> 11542.65s]  Not sorry.
[11542.65s -> 11546.32s]  Coward.
[11546.32s -> 11547.32s]  No balls.
[11547.32s -> 11548.32s]  Snap him.
[11548.32s -> 11551.42s]  You suck.
[11551.62s -> 11552.62s]  You suck.
[11552.62s -> 11557.54s]  You're fat in real life.
[11557.54s -> 11558.54s]  Snap now.
[11558.54s -> 11561.32s]  Ban.
[11561.32s -> 11562.32s]  Sorry, dude.
[11562.32s -> 11563.32s]  Okay, there it is.
[11563.32s -> 11564.94s]  Sorry, dude.
[11564.94s -> 11566.12s]  Yep.
[11566.12s -> 11567.12s]  No, I accept it.
[11567.12s -> 11568.12s]  I accept the apology.
[11570.96s -> 11571.96s]  Thanks, guys.
[11571.96s -> 11574.96s]  I like when you guys understand how you're being a little mean
[11574.96s -> 11575.96s]  and then somebody, you know,
[11575.96s -> 11577.96s]  you collectively can come to an agreement.
[11577.96s -> 11579.96s]  That makes me happy.
[11579.96s -> 11584.78s]  All right.
[11584.78s -> 11587.02s]  So let me...
[11587.02s -> 11588.02s]  Do I have beads?
[11588.02s -> 11591.35s]  All right.
[11591.35s -> 11593.35s]  Divine dragon attack power plus.
[11593.55s -> 11595.11s]  You hear that?
[11595.11s -> 11596.11s]  That's a fresh one.
[11596.11s -> 11602.64s]  I didn't even read it.
[11602.64s -> 11603.64s]  Whatever.
[11603.64s -> 11605.07s]  I gotta go read that.
[11605.07s -> 11607.63s]  I'm interested in the lore.
[11607.63s -> 11615.72s]  Where is it?
[11615.72s -> 11619.37s]  The divine dragon of the Everblossom
[11619.37s -> 11621.37s]  came from the west long ago,
[11621.37s -> 11623.37s]  eventually making its way to this land.
[11623.37s -> 11628.32s]  I got it.
[11628.32s -> 11631.01s]  Some parts of Ashina are exceedingly old,
[11631.01s -> 11633.01s]  water coursing through her ancient rocks
[11633.01s -> 11635.01s]  and so will allow the dragon to take root.
[11635.01s -> 11636.01s]  Okay.
[11636.01s -> 11642.43s]  Cool.
[11642.43s -> 11643.43s]  All right.
[11643.43s -> 11645.74s]  So I'm looking over at the chat
[11645.74s -> 11647.74s]  and I'm getting spammed.
[11647.94s -> 11649.94s]  Just spammed.
[11649.94s -> 11650.94s]  About how...
[11650.94s -> 11651.94s]  Don't!
[11651.94s -> 11653.94s]  Don't!
[11653.94s -> 11654.94s]  Don't go there!
[11654.94s -> 11655.94s]  Wait!
[11656.94s -> 11657.94s]  Wait!
[11657.94s -> 11660.94s]  So what do you want me to do?
[11660.94s -> 11666.64s]  Is it apparently an optional area
[11666.64s -> 11676.56s]  from where?
[11676.56s -> 11683.02s]  Just like from here.
[11683.02s -> 11693.99s]  There's a kite.
[11693.99s -> 11694.99s]  Okay.
[11694.99s -> 11706.30s]  This is the dungeon.
[11706.30s -> 11708.30s]  All these are locked up again.
[11708.30s -> 11712.02s]  So from the dungeon entrance
[11712.02s -> 11723.11s]  it's just from here.
[11723.11s -> 11724.11s]  No way!
[11724.11s -> 11726.76s]  Don't!
[11726.96s -> 11736.26s]  Can I get out of this way?
[11736.26s -> 11737.26s]  No, there's another window, right?
[11737.26s -> 11741.36s]  Let me rest first.
[11741.36s -> 11744.82s]  Turn on smart clicks.
[11745.82s -> 11751.64s]  There's an idol up there.
[11751.64s -> 11752.82s]  All right.
[11752.82s -> 11753.82s]  Here we go.
[11753.82s -> 11754.82s]  There's a door.
[11754.82s -> 11756.18s]  All right.
[11756.18s -> 11759.92s]  Find the...
[11759.92s -> 11761.16s]  All right.
[11761.16s -> 11763.16s]  Well, there's a guy spraying all kinds
[11763.16s -> 11764.16s]  of weird shit down there.
[11764.16s -> 11769.56s]  Hello?
[11769.56s -> 11770.56s]  Where?
[11770.56s -> 11778.20s]  So I'm apparently...
[11778.20s -> 11780.95s]  They're just fighting.
[11780.95s -> 11787.25s]  Oh, look.
[11787.25s -> 11791.34s]  I found the thing that people were yelling about
[11791.34s -> 11792.34s]  and screaming.
[11792.34s -> 11795.54s]  My ears are bleeding.
[11795.74s -> 11798.11s]  Because of how loud the screams were.
[11798.11s -> 11806.58s]  So it's down there.
[11806.58s -> 11810.62s]  Hey-o!
[11810.62s -> 11812.94s]  Just wait until them to fight.
[11812.94s -> 11813.94s]  You kill each other.
[11813.94s -> 11814.94s]  I don't care.
[11814.94s -> 11823.16s]  Why are they fighting each other?
[11823.16s -> 11829.26s]  All right.
[11829.26s -> 11830.26s]  Well, I don't know
[11830.26s -> 11831.26s]  if I wanted you to win or not.
[11831.26s -> 11840.25s]  Okay.
[11840.25s -> 11841.55s]  So...
[11841.55s -> 11850.73s]  Did I...
[11850.73s -> 11851.73s]  Was I supposed to hold on to it?
[11851.73s -> 11859.56s]  I did it.
[11859.56s -> 11861.31s]  Okay.
[11861.31s -> 11864.83s]  Yo, we are perfect!
[11864.83s -> 11867.90s]  Well, let me go get this idol.
[11867.90s -> 11884.25s]  Perfect streamer.
[11884.25s -> 11885.25s]  Okay.
[11885.25s -> 11887.58s]  So then from here
[11887.58s -> 11892.38s]  just go down this way?
[11892.58s -> 11895.54s]  Okay.
[11895.54s -> 11900.82s]  Who just...
[11900.82s -> 11901.82s]  How did...
[11901.82s -> 11905.14s]  Did everybody just see me?
[11905.14s -> 11906.14s]  Which way are they facing?
[11906.14s -> 11907.14s]  No.
[11907.14s -> 11912.93s]  This is just a fight.
[11912.93s -> 11913.93s]  My God.
[11913.93s -> 11914.93s]  Um...
[11914.93s -> 11916.93s]  I'm just gonna hang on the ledge
[11916.93s -> 11918.93s]  and just shimmy across.
[11918.93s -> 11919.93s]  Oh, there's items here.
[11919.93s -> 11922.58s]  Wait.
[11922.58s -> 11924.46s]  What?
[11929.05s -> 11930.05s]  All right.
[11930.05s -> 11931.05s]  Whatever.
[11931.05s -> 11936.06s]  You're killing him.
[11936.06s -> 11937.06s]  Stop.
[11937.06s -> 11939.84s]  All right.
[11939.84s -> 11944.66s]  I've had enough.
[11944.66s -> 11947.29s]  I've had just about enough.
[11947.29s -> 11969.07s]  Die!
[11969.07s -> 11970.07s]  The only guy fighting me!
[11970.27s -> 11971.27s]  It's a fair!
[11971.27s -> 11972.27s]  The guy shooting me!
[11972.27s -> 11978.80s]  If you didn't have a buddy
[11978.80s -> 11992.20s]  I'll not fire from your birthday.
[11992.20s -> 11993.20s]  Happy birthday!
[11993.20s -> 11995.95s]  Hope you have a good one.
[11995.95s -> 12002.99s]  Mystery dowsing powder.
[12002.99s -> 12004.36s]  It heals, burn status.
[12004.36s -> 12005.36s]  Burn, burn, burn, burn.
[12005.36s -> 12007.36s]  Fire, fire, fire, fire.
[12007.36s -> 12008.36s]  Mystery fear to her eyes.
[12008.36s -> 12010.36s]  The bloodshot, the waters of the fire.
[12010.36s -> 12012.36s]  Use this if you don't want to die from fire.
[12012.36s -> 12013.36s]  I got you.
[12013.36s -> 12014.36s]  Great.
[12014.36s -> 12015.36s]  Come on down.
[12015.36s -> 12017.05s]  Remember we talked about
[12017.05s -> 12018.05s]  how I need a fire thing?
[12018.05s -> 12020.05s]  Well, good thing I have it.
[12023.43s -> 12027.17s]  Man.
[12027.17s -> 12051.69s]  These guys have the two blades.
[12051.69s -> 12052.69s]  Really?
[12052.69s -> 12054.57s]  Like what?
[12054.57s -> 12067.22s]  Why do you have a trillion posture?
[12067.22s -> 12070.90s]  Like you have a million posture.
[12070.90s -> 12080.91s]  I got to bring your health down
[12080.91s -> 12081.91s]  to something like this.
[12081.91s -> 12083.47s]  This is fucking ridiculous.
[12083.47s -> 12085.47s]  Look at my posture.
[12085.47s -> 12086.47s]  This is the fucking hardest
[12086.47s -> 12090.98s]  enemy in the game.
[12090.98s -> 12094.79s]  They should upgrade you to boss.
[12094.79s -> 12097.18s]  Fuck off.
[12097.18s -> 12098.18s]  All right.
[12098.18s -> 12099.18s]  This is a big guy killing me.
[12099.38s -> 12110.29s]  Fuck off.
[12110.29s -> 12121.96s]  All right.
[12121.96s -> 12122.96s]  There's a big guy down here.
[12122.96s -> 12126.99s]  There's another one of these
[12126.99s -> 12130.74s]  goddamn dual welders
[12130.74s -> 12137.59s]  with the bane of my existence.
[12137.59s -> 12138.59s]  All right.
[12138.59s -> 12139.59s]  You had your friend
[12139.59s -> 12140.59s]  or your brother
[12140.59s -> 12141.59s]  or your colleague.
[12141.59s -> 12142.59s]  I don't even know
[12142.59s -> 12143.59s]  who the fuck it was.
[12143.59s -> 12144.83s]  Compare the two of you.
[12144.83s -> 12145.83s]  You don't deserve
[12145.83s -> 12146.83s]  to be down there.
[12146.83s -> 12153.28s]  Oh man.
[12153.28s -> 12154.28s]  All right.
[12154.28s -> 12156.42s]  Well, grab.
[12156.42s -> 12161.50s]  Interesting.
[12161.50s -> 12165.23s]  Drinking?
[12165.23s -> 12181.23s]  That's a slo-
[12181.23s -> 12182.23s]  Ah, that's a slo-
[12182.23s -> 12183.23s]  I thought it was a grab.
[12183.43s -> 12189.92s]  Ah.
[12189.92s -> 12204.10s]  Stop spamming block.
[12204.10s -> 12206.54s]  I need to know what he's doing.
[12206.54s -> 12209.54s]  You want me just to let him hit me?
[12209.54s -> 12210.84s]  Or do you want me to block
[12210.84s -> 12212.84s]  and see what he does for a move?
[12212.84s -> 12214.08s]  Ah, just let him hit me.
[12214.08s -> 12215.08s]  That sounds good.
[12215.08s -> 12232.74s]  Oh, this is going to be painful.
[12232.74s -> 12241.22s]  Because I got to go through
[12241.22s -> 12243.22s]  that whole goddamn camp again.
[12243.22s -> 12248.04s]  Fuck.
[12248.04s -> 12249.04s]  I got to go through this whole-
[12249.04s -> 12250.04s]  I can't-
[12250.04s -> 12251.04s]  Can I just sneak in here?
[12251.04s -> 12253.04s]  Ah, shit.
[12253.04s -> 12256.84s]  This is going to be awful.
[12256.84s -> 12257.84s]  I got to go through
[12257.84s -> 12258.84s]  this whole thing again.
[12258.84s -> 12267.50s]  I wonder what happened.
[12267.70s -> 12268.70s]  Okay, wait.
[12268.70s -> 12269.70s]  Hold on.
[12269.70s -> 12270.70s]  Can I, like, listen to you talk now?
[12270.70s -> 12273.01s]  I'm still Ashina Will-
[12273.01s -> 12278.02s]  Okay.
[12278.02s -> 12279.02s]  Um.
[12279.02s -> 12283.14s]  I wonder if I can find
[12283.14s -> 12284.14s]  a way to get around here
[12284.14s -> 12285.14s]  without having to do this every time.
[12285.14s -> 12296.32s]  I'm not in the right place.
[12296.32s -> 12297.88s]  Well, I wonder.
[12297.88s -> 12298.88s]  Is the entire camp
[12298.88s -> 12299.88s]  going to follow me?
[12299.88s -> 12300.88s]  Let's see.
[12300.88s -> 12301.88s]  Let's see how great
[12301.88s -> 12302.88s]  this area is.
[12302.88s -> 12306.40s]  I'm going to aggro the whole camp.
[12306.40s -> 12315.26s]  He's waiting for me?
[12315.26s -> 12316.26s]  Oh, that's not going to work out.
[12316.26s -> 12318.26s]  No way.
[12318.26s -> 12319.26s]  Oh, no way.
[12319.26s -> 12320.26s]  That's no way.
[12320.46s -> 12321.46s]  Everybody here.
[12321.46s -> 12327.50s]  What if I just run by everybody?
[12327.50s -> 12333.92s]  What else is here?
[12333.92s -> 12341.51s]  Is there something else here?
[12341.51s -> 12342.51s]  I guess this-
[12342.51s -> 12343.51s]  I don't have to do this.
[12343.51s -> 12355.48s]  Yeah, I remember this area,
[12355.48s -> 12356.48s]  the pan guy.
[12356.48s -> 12358.36s]  I'm going to just see
[12358.36s -> 12362.48s]  what's over here.
[12362.48s -> 12363.48s]  Oh, shit.
[12363.48s -> 12366.90s]  Okay, that's-
[12366.90s -> 12367.90s]  I need that item.
[12367.90s -> 12370.93s]  Oh, my God.
[12370.93s -> 12374.79s]  Jesus Christ.
[12374.79s -> 12375.79s]  This is crazy.
[12375.79s -> 12376.79s]  The way it does
[12376.79s -> 12379.18s]  is an idol up there.
[12379.18s -> 12380.18s]  Get up there.
[12380.18s -> 12381.18s]  Come on.
[12381.18s -> 12386.94s]  Oh, my God.
[12386.94s -> 12387.94s]  I can do it.
[12392.73s -> 12397.62s]  And I fell off.
[12397.62s -> 12398.62s]  I wonder if this
[12398.62s -> 12407.54s]  is an optional area.
[12407.54s -> 12408.54s]  I didn't-
[12408.54s -> 12409.54s]  How the fuck
[12409.54s -> 12410.54s]  am I supposed to know
[12410.54s -> 12411.54s]  you're up there?
[12411.54s -> 12412.54s]  Where is this-
[12412.54s -> 12413.54s]  Why am I locked onto this guy?
[12413.54s -> 12426.70s]  Oh, fuck this place.
[12426.70s -> 12440.74s]  Okay.
[12440.74s -> 12448.06s]  So, what the fuck
[12448.06s -> 12449.06s]  am I supposed to do now?
[12449.06s -> 12453.24s]  Well, I didn't mean
[12453.24s -> 12454.24s]  to do that.
[12454.24s -> 12457.21s]  Well, that was-
[12457.21s -> 12458.21s]  All right, I'm going to
[12458.21s -> 12459.21s]  go this way.
[12459.21s -> 12477.41s]  That's not an item.
[12477.41s -> 12497.72s]  Wait, where?
[12497.72s -> 12513.42s]  Oh, God.
[12513.42s -> 12518.14s]  Where did you come from?
[12518.14s -> 12530.70s]  Okay.
[12530.90s -> 12535.43s]  That wasn't terrible, but-
[12535.43s -> 12547.27s]  Oh, there's a lot over here, huh?
[12547.27s -> 12548.27s]  One guy on the road.
[12548.27s -> 12555.40s]  Ah.
[12555.40s -> 12559.26s]  I look over here.
[12559.26s -> 12560.26s]  Jeremiah, I think you're
[12560.26s -> 12561.26s]  making a very
[12561.26s -> 12562.26s]  prognitorial boss
[12562.26s -> 12563.26s]  can be challenging.
[12563.26s -> 12564.26s]  Take your time
[12564.26s -> 12565.26s]  and have fun with the game.
[12565.26s -> 12566.26s]  I'm glad you're trying
[12566.26s -> 12567.26s]  out your first
[12567.26s -> 12568.26s]  Soulsborne game.
[12568.26s -> 12569.26s]  It's-
[12569.26s -> 12570.26s]  We're still on-
[12570.26s -> 12571.26s]  All right, now you got me
[12571.26s -> 12572.26s]  all fucked up
[12572.26s -> 12574.26s]  because I had to read that.
[12574.26s -> 12578.34s]  Oh, God damn it.
[12578.34s -> 12581.05s]  I fucked it all up,
[12581.05s -> 12582.05s]  because I-
[12582.05s -> 12583.05s]  All right, I'm never reading
[12583.05s -> 12584.05s]  chat ever again.
[12590.63s -> 12591.63s]  I got the whole fucking
[12591.63s -> 12599.12s]  village after me now.
[12599.12s -> 12600.12s]  Oh, man.
[12600.12s -> 12601.12s]  Oh, there's no-
[12601.12s -> 12602.12s]  Nowhere is safe.
[12602.12s -> 12609.93s]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[12609.93s -> 12611.94s]  Oh, my God.
[12611.94s -> 12612.94s]  There's a chest.
[12612.94s -> 12614.43s]  No.
[12614.43s -> 12615.43s]  Nowhere is safe.
[12615.43s -> 12616.43s]  Nowhere is safe.
[12616.43s -> 12619.40s]  Whoa.
[12619.40s -> 12632.74s]  Oh, no way.
[12632.74s -> 12633.74s]  Oh.
[12633.74s -> 12634.74s]  Is there a
[12634.74s -> 12635.74s]  chained ogre here?
[12635.74s -> 12636.74s]  Are you sure that
[12636.74s -> 12637.74s]  they're not just
[12637.74s -> 12638.74s]  spawning in random
[12638.74s -> 12639.74s]  enemies of this zone?
[12639.74s -> 12640.74s]  That guy didn't even
[12640.74s -> 12641.74s]  try to fight me.
[12641.74s -> 12642.74s]  He just fucking
[12642.74s -> 12643.74s]  walking around.
[12643.74s -> 12646.90s]  That wasn't even-
[12646.90s -> 12647.90s]  That guy didn't even
[12647.90s -> 12648.90s]  try to fight me.
[12648.90s -> 12654.17s]  This is just an
[12654.17s -> 12655.17s]  optional war zone.
[12655.17s -> 12656.17s]  I don't-
[12656.17s -> 12657.17s]  I don't know-
[12657.17s -> 12658.17s]  I don't know
[12658.17s -> 12664.46s]  where I'm going.
[12664.46s -> 12665.46s]  Um, it's-
[12665.46s -> 12666.46s]  In there?
[12666.46s -> 12667.46s]  What is in there?
[12667.46s -> 12670.30s]  This is where I
[12670.30s -> 12671.30s]  fought the bull, right?
[12671.30s -> 12673.95s]  Oh, my God.
[12673.95s -> 12674.95s]  Wait, there's an
[12674.95s -> 12675.95s]  idol right here.
[12675.95s -> 12681.67s]  What-
[12681.67s -> 12687.46s]  Wait, where am I going?
[12687.46s -> 12688.46s]  Wait, what the fuck
[12688.46s -> 12689.46s]  is going on?
[12689.46s -> 12701.96s]  Are they-
[12701.96s -> 12702.96s]  There's random
[12702.96s -> 12703.96s]  enemies in here.
[12703.96s -> 12704.96s]  There's random
[12704.96s -> 12726.78s]  monster in here.
[12726.78s -> 12730.66s]  Demon of hatred.
[12733.31s -> 12736.31s]  He's got three bars.
[12736.31s -> 12737.31s]  Oh, boy.
[12737.31s -> 12738.31s]  Here we go.
[12738.31s -> 12741.38s]  All right.
[12741.38s -> 12742.38s]  You look like a
[12742.38s -> 12743.38s]  Dark Souls-
[12743.38s -> 12744.38s]  Souls-born
[12744.38s -> 12745.38s]  boss.
[12745.38s -> 12746.38s]  What do you got?
[12746.38s -> 12747.62s]  That's
[12747.62s -> 12748.62s]  pretty good.
[12748.62s -> 12749.99s]  You got a
[12749.99s -> 12750.99s]  firearm.
[12750.99s -> 12758.50s]  Okay.
[12758.50s -> 12759.50s]  I can-
[12759.50s -> 12760.50s]  I get you in the
[12760.50s -> 12763.73s]  hand.
[12763.73s -> 12764.73s]  Definitely-
[12764.73s -> 12765.73s]  I don't know if I want
[12765.73s -> 12766.73s]  to parry his
[12766.73s -> 12767.73s]  fire-like
[12767.73s -> 12782.47s]  swirly arm.
[12782.47s -> 12783.47s]  That's a-
[12783.47s -> 12784.47s]  Okay, that's
[12784.47s -> 12785.47s]  classified as a sweep.
[12786.47s -> 12787.47s]  Holy shit.
[12787.47s -> 12788.47s]  What the hell am I
[12788.47s -> 12789.47s]  supposed to do about
[12789.47s -> 12790.47s]  that?
[12790.47s -> 12791.47s]  I wonder if I should
[12791.47s -> 12805.70s]  just dodge.
[12805.70s -> 12807.07s]  If I
[12807.07s -> 12808.07s]  not, though.
[12808.07s -> 12816.34s]  Grab him.
[12816.34s -> 12817.34s]  Show me your
[12817.34s -> 12818.34s]  moves, please.
[12818.34s -> 12819.34s]  I want to see if
[12819.34s -> 12826.02s]  you can-
[12826.02s -> 12827.02s]  Good thing there's an
[12827.02s -> 12840.61s]  idol right here.
[12840.61s -> 12841.61s]  Is he-
[12841.61s -> 12842.61s]  Wow, that's an
[12842.61s -> 12843.61s]  enormous hitbox.
[12843.61s -> 12844.61s]  Holy shit.
[12844.61s -> 12851.90s]  Oh, my
[12851.90s -> 12852.90s]  goodness gracious.
[12852.90s -> 12853.90s]  Okay.
[12853.90s -> 12854.90s]  Well, a couple of
[12854.90s -> 12856.14s]  things that are very
[12856.14s -> 12863.34s]  clear here.
[12863.34s -> 12864.34s]  No, this is only
[12864.34s -> 12865.34s]  magnetic.
[12865.34s -> 12866.34s]  Red.
[12866.34s -> 12867.83s]  So it was-
[12867.83s -> 12868.83s]  No.
[12868.83s -> 12869.83s]  Uh, fire
[12869.83s -> 12870.83s]  gourd.
[12870.83s -> 12872.14s]  There is it.
[12872.14s -> 12873.14s]  Reduces burn
[12873.14s -> 12874.14s]  buildup.
[12874.14s -> 12875.70s]  Is he gonna
[12875.70s -> 12876.70s]  drink it
[12876.70s -> 12877.70s]  whenever it's
[12877.70s -> 12882.97s]  available?
[12882.97s -> 12883.97s]  Alright.
[12883.97s -> 12897.24s]  Let me try-
[12897.24s -> 12898.24s]  Let me just
[12898.24s -> 12899.24s]  get-
[12899.24s -> 12900.24s]  Let me just see
[12900.24s -> 12901.24s]  it again.
[12901.24s -> 12907.02s]  Let me fight you
[12907.02s -> 12908.02s]  like a-
[12908.02s -> 12909.02s]  Let me fight you
[12909.02s -> 12910.02s]  like a fucking
[12910.02s -> 12911.02s]  dark soul boss.
[12911.02s -> 12912.02s]  Jesus!
[12912.02s -> 12925.17s]  He just does it-
[12925.17s -> 12926.17s]  Wow!
[12926.17s -> 12928.94s]  Wow!
[12928.94s -> 12929.94s]  That's a
[12929.94s -> 12930.94s]  one-hit kill.
[12930.94s -> 12934.87s]  That-
[12934.87s -> 12935.87s]  Look at that
[12935.87s -> 12937.24s]  hitbox.
[12937.24s -> 12938.24s]  Did you see how
[12938.24s -> 12939.24s]  big that hitbox was?
[12939.24s -> 12940.24s]  There could have
[12940.24s -> 12949.61s]  been seven of us
[12949.61s -> 12952.26s]  lined up there.
[12952.26s -> 12953.26s]  Ooh.
[12953.26s -> 12954.26s]  Hey, this is
[12954.26s -> 12955.26s]  the only-
[12955.26s -> 12956.26s]  Let's just
[12956.26s -> 12961.85s]  keep getting
[12961.85s -> 12962.85s]  harassed kicked.
[12962.85s -> 12973.30s]  Let's go.
[12973.30s -> 12974.30s]  Let's try to
[12974.30s -> 12975.30s]  take it slow this
[12975.30s -> 12976.30s]  time.
[12976.30s -> 12977.30s]  You gotta run
[12977.30s -> 12980.34s]  underneath that.
[12980.34s -> 12981.34s]  Once he queues up
[12981.34s -> 12982.34s]  that, you gotta
[12982.34s -> 12983.34s]  run.
[12983.34s -> 12984.34s]  Oh, boy.
[12984.34s -> 12985.34s]  That-
[12985.34s -> 12986.34s]  The arm is
[12986.34s -> 12987.34s]  so weird
[12987.34s -> 12988.34s]  because it's so
[12988.34s -> 12989.34s]  squiggly.
[12989.34s -> 12992.43s]  That's the
[12992.43s -> 12993.43s]  problem, man.
[12993.43s -> 12994.43s]  Look at this
[12994.43s -> 13003.10s]  thing.
[13003.10s -> 13004.10s]  Maybe-
[13004.10s -> 13005.10s]  I'm just gonna-
[13005.10s -> 13006.10s]  Maybe just
[13006.10s -> 13008.04s]  run behind him
[13008.04s -> 13009.04s]  to stay all the
[13009.04s -> 13010.04s]  way behind him.
[13010.04s -> 13011.04s]  Don't even
[13011.04s -> 13012.04s]  let him give him a
[13012.04s -> 13013.04s]  chance to, like,
[13013.04s -> 13014.41s]  touch you.
[13014.41s -> 13015.41s]  He's gonna try
[13015.41s -> 13020.55s]  to do it, but
[13020.55s -> 13021.55s]  maybe-
[13021.55s -> 13032.71s]  Can I get in there
[13032.71s -> 13039.65s]  quickly?
[13039.65s -> 13040.65s]  I can't go
[13040.65s -> 13041.65s]  through his
[13041.65s -> 13047.62s]  legs.
[13047.62s -> 13048.62s]  What is this?
[13048.62s -> 13054.34s]  Jesus.
[13054.34s -> 13055.34s]  Oh-ho-ho.
[13055.34s -> 13056.34s]  Damn.
[13056.34s -> 13057.34s]  All right.
[13057.34s -> 13058.90s]  I'm gonna-
[13058.90s -> 13059.90s]  This is crazy.
[13059.90s -> 13060.90s]  Oh,
[13060.90s -> 13064.00s]  leave the fuck away.
[13064.00s -> 13065.00s]  Like that.
[13065.00s -> 13066.00s]  Not good.
[13066.00s -> 13068.58s]  Come on.
[13068.58s -> 13069.58s]  I can't attach
[13069.58s -> 13070.58s]  to him.
[13070.58s -> 13071.58s]  See, when he-
[13071.58s -> 13072.58s]  When he gets in front
[13072.58s -> 13073.95s]  of you, that's, like,
[13073.95s -> 13079.61s]  the worst part.
[13079.61s -> 13080.61s]  You gotta stay
[13080.61s -> 13081.61s]  with him.
[13081.61s -> 13082.61s]  Jesus.
[13082.61s -> 13083.61s]  He gets so
[13083.61s -> 13087.22s]  much range on you,
[13087.22s -> 13088.22s]  and then it's, like,
[13088.22s -> 13090.03s]  silly spring on him.
[13090.03s -> 13091.03s]  See you later.
[13091.03s -> 13092.03s]  There's gotta be a
[13092.03s -> 13093.03s]  way I can get
[13093.03s -> 13094.03s]  the fucker right.
[13094.03s -> 13095.03s]  Guess not.
[13095.03s -> 13097.68s]  What the fuck are
[13097.68s -> 13098.68s]  you supposed to do
[13098.68s -> 13099.68s]  against those?
[13099.68s -> 13105.85s]  Shit.
[13105.85s -> 13115.66s]  They take up, like,
[13115.66s -> 13116.66s]  the whole screen.
[13116.66s -> 13121.10s]  Jesus.
[13121.10s -> 13122.10s]  Run straight through,
[13122.10s -> 13123.10s]  I'm thinking.
[13123.10s -> 13131.06s]  I'm thinking run
[13131.06s -> 13132.06s]  straight through those.
[13132.06s -> 13139.58s]  All right.
[13139.58s -> 13140.58s]  Run straight.
[13140.58s -> 13141.58s]  He's gonna throw
[13141.58s -> 13142.58s]  the fireballs.
[13142.58s -> 13143.58s]  I think I can go
[13143.58s -> 13144.58s]  right underneath him.
[13144.58s -> 13145.94s]  Yup.
[13145.94s -> 13146.94s]  All right.
[13146.94s -> 13147.94s]  It's just figuring it out.
[13147.94s -> 13148.94s]  It's just figuring
[13148.94s -> 13162.09s]  that shit out.
[13162.09s -> 13173.12s]  We go again.
[13173.12s -> 13174.12s]  Oh, yeah.
[13174.12s -> 13175.12s]  At least I didn't get hit.
[13175.12s -> 13176.12s]  All right.
[13176.12s -> 13184.53s]  First phase is kind of-
[13184.53s -> 13185.53s]  I'm figuring
[13185.53s -> 13186.53s]  this shit out.
[13186.53s -> 13188.34s]  Ooh, that hurts a lot.
[13188.34s -> 13189.34s]  Damn it.
[13189.34s -> 13190.52s]  Oh, my God.
[13190.52s -> 13191.52s]  That does so much damage.
[13191.52s -> 13192.52s]  Oh, that's, like,
[13192.52s -> 13193.52s]  almost-
[13193.52s -> 13195.59s]  That's, like,
[13195.59s -> 13196.59s]  almost 80 percent
[13196.59s -> 13197.59s]  of your whole health bar.
[13197.59s -> 13198.83s]  Fuck.
[13198.83s -> 13208.71s]  Oh.
[13208.71s -> 13209.71s]  Slowly but surely,
[13209.71s -> 13210.71s]  I'm figuring it out.
[13210.71s -> 13215.92s]  You know what I mean?
[13215.92s -> 13216.92s]  Let's get an
[13216.92s -> 13217.92s]  actual attempt with
[13217.92s -> 13218.92s]  me not getting
[13218.92s -> 13219.92s]  hit by the fireballs.
[13219.92s -> 13221.48s]  That's a-
[13221.48s -> 13237.70s]  That's a big deal.
[13237.70s -> 13238.70s]  Here comes fireballs.
[13238.70s -> 13254.02s]  Oh, fuck.
[13254.02s -> 13255.02s]  I thought it was
[13255.02s -> 13256.02s]  a little bit longer
[13256.02s -> 13257.02s]  than that.
[13257.02s -> 13258.19s]  That's all right.
[13258.19s -> 13259.19s]  That's not good.
[13259.19s -> 13260.19s]  Yeah, I was
[13260.19s -> 13261.19s]  fucked there.
[13261.19s -> 13262.19s]  So I thought,
[13262.19s -> 13263.19s]  in my brain,
[13263.19s -> 13264.19s]  when he does the belly
[13264.19s -> 13265.19s]  flop, I thought
[13265.19s -> 13266.19s]  maybe I could
[13266.19s -> 13267.19s]  hold onto it.
[13267.19s -> 13268.19s]  But last time,
[13268.19s -> 13269.19s]  it still hit me.
[13269.19s -> 13274.98s]  That right there,
[13274.98s -> 13275.98s]  that right there,
[13275.98s -> 13276.98s]  that,
[13276.98s -> 13277.98s]  that little, like,
[13277.98s -> 13278.98s]  whip.
[13278.98s -> 13279.98s]  He does, like,
[13279.98s -> 13280.98s]  a tiny little jab,
[13280.98s -> 13281.98s]  and it's a massive,
[13281.98s -> 13282.98s]  fucking awful thing
[13282.98s -> 13283.98s]  you have to avoid.
[13283.98s -> 13289.12s]  If I'm going to try
[13289.12s -> 13290.12s]  to stay next to that leg,
[13290.12s -> 13296.99s]  then I've got to
[13296.99s -> 13297.99s]  be ready to
[13297.99s -> 13298.99s]  dodge straight through that.
[13298.99s -> 13312.90s]  Bro?
[13312.90s -> 13313.90s]  Oh, this is
[13313.90s -> 13320.46s]  a bad place to be.
[13320.46s -> 13321.46s]  This-
[13321.46s -> 13322.46s]  This, I couldn't
[13322.46s -> 13323.46s]  pick a worse place
[13323.46s -> 13324.46s]  to be right now.
[13324.46s -> 13325.46s]  Fuck it.
[13325.46s -> 13326.46s]  Of course he has to-
[13326.46s -> 13327.46s]  Of course he goes
[13327.46s -> 13328.46s]  all the way back here.
[13328.46s -> 13329.46s]  Like, look at him.
[13329.46s -> 13330.46s]  Like, get out of here.
[13330.46s -> 13331.46s]  Like, why?
[13331.46s -> 13332.46s]  Get the fuck out of there.
[13332.46s -> 13333.46s]  Because if I-
[13333.46s -> 13334.46s]  I have to run over there
[13334.46s -> 13335.46s]  to make him do anything,
[13335.46s -> 13336.46s]  and now he's going to
[13336.46s -> 13337.46s]  throw the fire at me.
[13337.46s -> 13341.26s]  It's such a huge,
[13341.26s -> 13342.26s]  open area.
[13342.26s -> 13343.26s]  How do you get stuck
[13343.26s -> 13344.26s]  in the wall?
[13344.26s -> 13346.26s]  This is the biggest area
[13346.26s -> 13348.26s]  of any Souls game.
[13348.26s -> 13349.26s]  Besides maybe Orphan.
[13349.26s -> 13378.66s]  And you go into the corner.
[13378.66s -> 13380.66s]  Oh my goodness.
[13380.66s -> 13389.83s]  Two steps.
[13389.83s -> 13419.10s]  There we go.
[13419.10s -> 13425.66s]  Nah, I'll get
[13425.66s -> 13426.66s]  me the fuck out of here.
[13426.66s -> 13427.66s]  No corner, no corner,
[13427.66s -> 13428.66s]  no corner, corner, corner.
[13428.66s -> 13429.66s]  Here comes.
[13429.66s -> 13432.50s]  See?
[13432.50s -> 13433.50s]  I have to jump twice.
[13433.50s -> 13434.50s]  There he is.
[13434.50s -> 13442.20s]  He does it twice,
[13442.20s -> 13443.20s]  and the step.
[13443.20s -> 13444.20s]  Oh.
[13444.20s -> 13445.20s]  Damn, he does like
[13445.20s -> 13446.38s]  four moves in a row there.
[13446.38s -> 13447.38s]  Fuck.
[13447.38s -> 13448.38s]  This fucking silly string.
[13448.38s -> 13449.38s]  Oh my god, please.
[13449.38s -> 13454.01s]  Dude, I don't even know
[13454.01s -> 13455.01s]  what he-
[13455.01s -> 13456.01s]  What the fuck
[13456.01s -> 13457.01s]  he's even doing for moves.
[13457.01s -> 13460.30s]  He's kind of just
[13460.30s -> 13461.30s]  ripping his body in circles.
[13461.30s -> 13462.30s]  And his arm is doing
[13462.30s -> 13463.30s]  the rest of the work.
[13463.30s -> 13464.30s]  Not very good telegraph,
[13464.30s -> 13465.30s]  so.
[13465.30s -> 13466.30s]  What's this?
[13466.30s -> 13467.30s]  Well, I got him down
[13467.30s -> 13468.30s]  to his lowest point,
[13468.30s -> 13469.30s]  and he's like,
[13469.30s -> 13472.20s]  oh my god.
[13472.20s -> 13473.20s]  Oh my god.
[13473.20s -> 13474.20s]  Oh my god.
[13474.20s -> 13477.55s]  Oh my god.
[13477.55s -> 13478.55s]  I got him down
[13478.55s -> 13479.55s]  to as low as I've got him ever.
[13479.55s -> 13507.10s]  It's that,
[13507.10s -> 13508.10s]  it's the close swipe it is.
[13508.10s -> 13510.23s]  Well, it's not gonna die.
[13510.23s -> 13511.23s]  That's gonna happen, man.
[13511.23s -> 13512.23s]  This is,
[13512.23s -> 13513.23s]  this boss has got,
[13513.23s -> 13514.23s]  so I got three phases
[13514.23s -> 13515.23s]  with this dude.
[13515.23s -> 13524.73s]  Let me see if I can just get,
[13524.73s -> 13525.73s]  I wanna try to get him down
[13525.73s -> 13526.73s]  by two and one.
[13526.73s -> 13527.73s]  See what he does
[13527.73s -> 13528.73s]  in the next phase.
[13528.73s -> 13529.73s]  Like, I'll get in here.
[13529.73s -> 13552.73s]  Let's go.
[13552.73s -> 13553.73s]  When you get
[13553.73s -> 13554.73s]  a certain amount of range,
[13554.73s -> 13555.73s]  he does that crazy
[13555.73s -> 13556.73s]  move set there.
[13556.73s -> 13568.40s]  To the corner again.
[13568.40s -> 13569.40s]  God, what's this?
[13569.40s -> 13570.40s]  What's my luck?
[13570.40s -> 13571.40s]  Come on.
[13571.40s -> 13575.97s]  Back it up.
[13575.97s -> 13576.97s]  I ain't gonna have that happen.
[13576.97s -> 13579.36s]  Fuck, I thought he
[13579.36s -> 13580.36s]  was throwing balls.
[13580.36s -> 13582.05s]  Fuck.
[13582.05s -> 13591.54s]  Oh my god.
[13591.54s -> 13593.54s]  Of course he does it there.
[13593.54s -> 13594.54s]  Really?
[13594.54s -> 13611.64s]  No way.
[13611.64s -> 13612.64s]  That's the first time
[13612.64s -> 13613.64s]  that's happened.
[13613.64s -> 13614.64s]  It's because I was coming
[13614.64s -> 13615.64s]  down an incline.
[13615.64s -> 13616.64s]  Oh my lord.
[13616.64s -> 13619.22s]  It's because I've
[13619.22s -> 13620.22s]  gone down an incline.
[13620.22s -> 13626.71s]  Yeah.
[13626.71s -> 13627.71s]  All right.
[13627.71s -> 13634.18s]  One more try.
[13634.18s -> 13635.18s]  And then I'm gonna go,
[13635.18s -> 13636.18s]  come back.
[13636.18s -> 13638.13s]  I want new items.
[13638.13s -> 13639.13s]  And I still got hit by it.
[13639.13s -> 13640.13s]  Oh, that's helpful.
[13640.13s -> 13645.27s]  Like, what?
[13645.27s -> 13646.27s]  Really?
[13646.27s -> 13647.27s]  I still got hit by that?
[13647.27s -> 13648.27s]  What was that?
[13648.27s -> 13649.27s]  It was like a fucking
[13649.27s -> 13650.27s]  two second residual hitbox?
[13650.27s -> 13651.27s]  This guy may as well
[13651.27s -> 13652.27s]  be hitting me with a fucking
[13652.27s -> 13653.27s]  giant square.
[13653.27s -> 13654.27s]  He's got a giant flaming
[13654.27s -> 13663.18s]  square on his head.
[13663.18s -> 13664.18s]  Oh.
[13664.18s -> 13665.18s]  There it is.
[13665.18s -> 13666.18s]  There's a twice.
[13666.18s -> 13667.18s]  And he stomps.
[13667.18s -> 13668.18s]  Fuck.
[13668.18s -> 13669.18s]  Oh.
[13669.18s -> 13688.40s]  Two stomps.
[13688.40s -> 13700.46s]  He's got such
[13700.46s -> 13701.46s]  a difficult move set
[13701.46s -> 13702.46s]  to fucking telegraph.
[13702.46s -> 13703.46s]  It really is ridiculous.
[13703.46s -> 13704.70s]  Sometimes he stomps twice.
[13704.70s -> 13711.25s]  Oh yeah, yikes.
[13711.25s -> 13712.25s]  I'll get it though.
[13712.25s -> 13714.19s]  It'll take me a while.
[13715.19s -> 13716.19s]  I didn't jump?
[13716.19s -> 13717.19s]  I mean, I'm in the air.
[13717.19s -> 13718.19s]  I was...
[13718.19s -> 13719.19s]  You guys saw that.
[13719.19s -> 13720.19s]  I'm in the fucking
[13720.19s -> 13721.19s]  goddamn air.
[13721.19s -> 13722.19s]  Back up.
[13722.19s -> 13723.19s]  Two stomps.
[13723.19s -> 13724.19s]  Fuck.
[13724.19s -> 13725.19s]  I thought it was the balls.
[13725.19s -> 13739.81s]  Oh, man.
[13739.81s -> 13740.81s]  What?
[13740.81s -> 13741.81s]  No.
[13741.81s -> 13742.98s]  Come on.
[13742.98s -> 13743.98s]  What the fuck?
[13743.98s -> 13744.98s]  Do I have five more
[13744.98s -> 13775.02s]  seconds?
[13775.02s -> 13776.26s]  No.
[13776.26s -> 13777.26s]  Fuck.
[13777.26s -> 13781.70s]  Fuck.
[13781.70s -> 13782.70s]  Fuck.
[13782.70s -> 13784.33s]  Fuck.
[13784.33s -> 13785.33s]  Fuck.
[13785.33s -> 13786.33s]  Fuck.
[13786.33s -> 13789.68s]  Fuck.
[13789.68s -> 13790.68s]  Fuck.
[13790.68s -> 13791.68s]  Fuck.
[13791.68s -> 13792.68s]  Fuck.
[13792.68s -> 13794.82s]  Fuck.
[13794.82s -> 13795.82s]  Fuck.
[13795.82s -> 13799.17s]  Fuck.
[13799.17s -> 13800.17s]  Do I have 500 ping?
[13800.17s -> 13817.73s]  That's actually fucking
[13817.73s -> 13818.73s]  infuriating.
[13818.73s -> 13819.73s]  The dream of maybe
[13819.73s -> 13820.73s]  taking him down
[13820.73s -> 13821.73s]  is still possible.
[13821.73s -> 13835.13s]  Oh, fuck.
[13835.13s -> 13836.13s]  Here it comes.
[13836.13s -> 13837.13s]  He's gonna throw it.
[13837.13s -> 13852.32s]  Oh, he's so close to one.
[13852.32s -> 13854.32s]  Firecrack is worthless here.
[13854.32s -> 13856.32s]  What items could I possibly
[13856.32s -> 13857.32s]  use right now to make this
[13857.32s -> 13858.32s]  easier on me?
[13858.32s -> 13859.32s]  Maybe...
[13859.32s -> 13860.32s]  What about this?
[13860.32s -> 13861.32s]  I'm curious.
[13861.32s -> 13866.34s]  Let's just see something.
[13866.34s -> 13869.69s]  Finger whistle.
[13869.69s -> 13870.69s]  I'm just throwing darts
[13870.69s -> 13871.69s]  here.
[13871.69s -> 13881.95s]  Hold on.
[13881.95s -> 13882.95s]  Oh, come over there.
[13882.95s -> 13883.95s]  Hi.
[13883.95s -> 13893.90s]  You wanted my attention?
[13893.90s -> 13894.90s]  Well, I'm here.
[13894.90s -> 13895.90s]  I poisoned him with this?
[13895.90s -> 13896.90s]  No, I got the wrong thing
[13896.90s -> 13900.31s]  equipped.
[13900.31s -> 13907.57s]  Just kill me.
[13907.57s -> 13908.57s]  Do it again.
[13908.57s -> 13926.10s]  He's weak to the AK.
[13926.10s -> 13928.59s]  I would hope so.
[13928.59s -> 13929.59s]  Defense sugar.
[13929.59s -> 13930.59s]  Yeah, I mean,
[13930.59s -> 13931.59s]  here's the thing though.
[13931.59s -> 13932.59s]  I want to...
[13932.59s -> 13933.59s]  If I use those now,
[13933.59s -> 13934.59s]  I'll just waste them.
[13934.59s -> 13935.59s]  You know, I want to get
[13935.59s -> 13936.59s]  in a position where
[13936.59s -> 13942.20s]  I'm confident in at least
[13942.20s -> 13943.20s]  dodging or blocking or
[13943.20s -> 13944.20s]  moving away from...
[13944.20s -> 13945.20s]  They're already moved.
[13945.20s -> 13946.20s]  Just look right there.
[13946.20s -> 13947.20s]  Like, oh,
[13947.20s -> 13948.20s]  I get the candy.
[13948.20s -> 13949.20s]  It's gone.
[13949.20s -> 13950.20s]  And this guy will use
[13950.20s -> 13952.40s]  them all.
[13952.40s -> 13953.40s]  He'll take every
[13953.40s -> 13954.40s]  single thing from me.
[13954.40s -> 13963.77s]  I guess some of the ones
[13963.77s -> 13964.77s]  that are huge telegraphs
[13964.77s -> 13965.77s]  like this stomp.
[13965.77s -> 13966.77s]  Maybe I'll try to deflect
[13966.77s -> 13967.77s]  it.
[13967.77s -> 13973.42s]  Let me see if it's
[13973.42s -> 13974.42s]  possible.
[13974.42s -> 13975.42s]  Let's see if I can get him
[13975.42s -> 13980.31s]  to do it.
[13980.31s -> 13982.51s]  What?
[13982.51s -> 13991.75s]  He has so much time
[13991.75s -> 13992.75s]  on that move.
[13992.75s -> 13993.75s]  You've got to time that
[13993.75s -> 14002.03s]  move perfectly.
[14002.03s -> 14003.03s]  You're going to get hit
[14003.03s -> 14004.03s]  by it every time.
[14004.03s -> 14006.17s]  Stomp.
[14006.17s -> 14007.17s]  Let me see if it's even
[14007.17s -> 14008.17s]  possible, man.
[14008.17s -> 14009.17s]  Come on.
[14009.17s -> 14012.18s]  Well, he didn't get me.
[14012.18s -> 14013.18s]  Somehow.
[14013.18s -> 14019.28s]  What?
[14019.28s -> 14020.28s]  No.
[14020.28s -> 14021.28s]  Like, really,
[14021.28s -> 14022.28s]  really,
[14022.28s -> 14023.28s]  realistically speaking,
[14023.28s -> 14025.28s]  why did I not dodge that?
[14025.28s -> 14026.28s]  I...
[14026.28s -> 14027.28s]  Realistically speaking,
[14027.28s -> 14028.28s]  let's be real about that.
[14028.28s -> 14029.78s]  I can't jump that?
[14029.78s -> 14030.78s]  Or am I just too close?
[14030.78s -> 14031.78s]  I feel like it's half
[14031.78s -> 14032.78s]  the time that move I can
[14032.78s -> 14036.19s]  get away from.
[14036.19s -> 14037.19s]  That's not, like,
[14037.19s -> 14038.19s]  technically a sweep
[14038.19s -> 14051.27s]  movement.
[14051.27s -> 14052.27s]  Well, I did it.
[14052.27s -> 14053.27s]  I'm not even sure
[14053.27s -> 14077.70s]  what I'm doing here.
[14077.70s -> 14078.70s]  It looked like
[14078.70s -> 14079.70s]  it was doing something.
[14079.70s -> 14080.70s]  Fucking gigantic box.
[14080.70s -> 14081.70s]  Fuck you.
[14081.70s -> 14082.70s]  No, he's jumping!
[14082.70s -> 14090.02s]  Oh!
[14090.02s -> 14091.02s]  Phase one.
[14091.02s -> 14092.02s]  Done.
[14092.02s -> 14093.02s]  Phase two.
[14093.02s -> 14117.62s]  Incoming.
[14117.62s -> 14122.00s]  Attack.
[14122.00s -> 14123.00s]  Oh, now what?
[14123.00s -> 14124.00s]  Now what do I have to do?
[14124.00s -> 14128.82s]  Same?
[14128.82s -> 14129.82s]  More of the same?
[14129.82s -> 14136.70s]  A little more of the same.
[14136.70s -> 14137.70s]  What the fuck happened there?
[14137.70s -> 14138.70s]  You have to stay...
[14138.70s -> 14143.78s]  You've got to just
[14143.78s -> 14144.78s]  run the fucking way
[14144.78s -> 14145.78s]  when you go to that move.
[14145.78s -> 14146.78s]  You just run the fucking way
[14146.78s -> 14147.78s]  when you go to that move.
[14147.78s -> 14158.55s]  You just run the fucking way
[14158.55s -> 14159.55s]  when you go to that move.
[14159.55s -> 14164.12s]  You just run the fucking way
[14164.12s -> 14174.51s]  when you go to that move.
[14174.51s -> 14175.51s]  You just run the fucking way
[14175.51s -> 14176.51s]  when you go to that move.
[14176.51s -> 14177.82s]  You just do.
[14177.82s -> 14178.82s]  There's no way
[14178.82s -> 14179.82s]  you can dodge those.
[14179.82s -> 14180.82s]  Like right now,
[14180.82s -> 14182.18s]  I've got to come out of there.
[14182.18s -> 14183.18s]  Hold on.
[14183.18s -> 14186.02s]  Itchy eye.
[14186.02s -> 14187.02s]  This is not eye...
[14187.02s -> 14201.58s]  Why would I even use that?
[14201.58s -> 14202.58s]  Oh!
[14202.58s -> 14204.97s]  Sorry.
[14204.97s -> 14211.07s]  Uh...
[14211.07s -> 14224.28s]  Um...
[14224.28s -> 14225.28s]  Let's go.
[14225.28s -> 14226.28s]  Let's try it again.
[14226.28s -> 14227.28s]  I don't know.
[14227.28s -> 14228.28s]  My eye, my right eye
[14228.28s -> 14230.93s]  is so irritated right now.
[14230.93s -> 14231.93s]  Why?
[14231.93s -> 14232.93s]  Do you have like
[14232.93s -> 14233.93s]  allergies or something?
[14233.93s -> 14234.93s]  Fuck.
[14234.93s -> 14236.87s]  Just kill me.
[14236.87s -> 14237.87s]  I've got to start over.
[14237.87s -> 14238.87s]  Ugh.
[14238.87s -> 14244.98s]  I've got this like
[14244.98s -> 14248.07s]  extreme eye itchy eye
[14248.07s -> 14249.07s]  irritation.
[14249.07s -> 14250.07s]  Ugh.
[14250.07s -> 14251.07s]  What the fuck
[14251.07s -> 14252.07s]  is happening right now?
[14252.07s -> 14253.07s]  This is like
[14253.07s -> 14260.65s]  unbearable.
[14260.65s -> 14261.65s]  My right eye
[14261.65s -> 14262.65s]  is like going crazy.
[14262.65s -> 14263.65s]  Ugh.
[14263.65s -> 14265.27s]  Ugh.
[14265.27s -> 14266.27s]  This is a problem.
[14266.27s -> 14267.27s]  I'm trying to deflect it.
[14267.27s -> 14270.11s]  It's a mistake.
[14270.11s -> 14272.76s]  Honest to God,
[14272.76s -> 14273.76s]  I just did keep doing
[14273.76s -> 14288.44s]  what I was doing.
[14288.44s -> 14289.44s]  So much to happen.
[14289.44s -> 14290.44s]  I need to at least
[14290.44s -> 14291.44s]  get to like
[14291.44s -> 14292.44s]  the second or third phase.
[14292.44s -> 14294.32s]  Maybe if you...
[14294.32s -> 14296.14s]  I wonder if you deflected
[14296.14s -> 14297.14s]  if you like
[14297.14s -> 14298.14s]  toss them backwards
[14298.14s -> 14299.14s]  or something.
[14299.14s -> 14300.89s]  Going off.
[14301.89s -> 14302.89s]  You get him to do that,
[14302.89s -> 14303.89s]  you get a good
[14303.89s -> 14318.12s]  bunch of hits on him.
[14318.12s -> 14323.58s]  Here he goes.
[14323.58s -> 14330.46s]  He's going up.
[14330.46s -> 14340.85s]  Get me away from
[14340.85s -> 14341.85s]  the wall here, man.
[14341.85s -> 14342.85s]  We've got to get away
[14342.85s -> 14349.27s]  from the wall.
[14349.27s -> 14350.27s]  Away from the wall.
[14350.27s -> 14355.10s]  Away from the...
[14355.10s -> 14356.10s]  Just come over here.
[14356.10s -> 14361.50s]  But if you go too far away,
[14361.50s -> 14362.50s]  he might throw that shit at you.
[14362.50s -> 14363.80s]  You know what I'm saying?
[14363.80s -> 14364.80s]  He might throw
[14364.80s -> 14365.80s]  that shit at you.
[14365.80s -> 14367.49s]  Hey.
[14367.49s -> 14368.49s]  Throw.
[14368.49s -> 14369.49s]  Throw.
[14369.49s -> 14370.49s]  Throw.
[14370.49s -> 14371.49s]  Throw.
[14371.49s -> 14403.19s]  I'm far away.
[14403.19s -> 14404.82s]  Got it.
[14404.82s -> 14405.82s]  Eight.
[14405.82s -> 14406.82s]  Nine.
[14406.82s -> 14407.82s]  Nine.
[14407.82s -> 14411.10s]  Ten.
[14411.10s -> 14412.10s]  Got it.
[14412.10s -> 14413.10s]  Eight boards.
[14413.10s -> 14420.10s]  Let's go.
[14420.10s -> 14421.10s]  He does that
[14421.10s -> 14425.42s]  explosion.
[14425.42s -> 14431.95s]  Get it.
[14431.95s -> 14432.95s]  Wait just a minute.
[14432.95s -> 14433.95s]  Oh.
[14433.95s -> 14434.95s]  He fucking did
[14434.95s -> 14460.00s]  something different.
[14460.00s -> 14461.00s]  Oh.
[14461.00s -> 14462.56s]  That was
[14462.56s -> 14463.56s]  a weird angle.
[14463.56s -> 14475.92s]  Oh.
[14475.92s -> 14476.92s]  I hate that move.
[14476.92s -> 14477.92s]  It's so hard to get
[14477.92s -> 14478.92s]  around.
[14478.92s -> 14480.61s]  Oh.
[14480.61s -> 14481.61s]  It really is.
[14481.61s -> 14482.61s]  Just fucking takes up
[14482.61s -> 14483.61s]  so much real estate.
[14483.61s -> 14484.61s]  He's got more
[14484.61s -> 14485.61s]  moves and shit now.
[14485.61s -> 14486.61s]  This motherfucker
[14486.61s -> 14487.61s]  is adding moves.
[14487.61s -> 14506.13s]  That's new.
[14506.13s -> 14507.13s]  That's...
[14507.13s -> 14508.13s]  Oh my God.
[14508.13s -> 14509.13s]  There's so many
[14509.13s -> 14510.13s]  things to learn.
[14510.13s -> 14511.13s]  What the fuck
[14511.13s -> 14512.13s]  is this?
[14512.13s -> 14515.42s]  Jesus Christ,
[14515.42s -> 14516.42s]  man.
[14516.42s -> 14517.42s]  We got like
[14517.42s -> 14518.42s]  another...
[14518.42s -> 14519.42s]  We got like
[14519.42s -> 14520.42s]  a 25 minute boss fight
[14520.42s -> 14521.42s]  if you do everything right.
[14521.42s -> 14522.42s]  Oh my
[14522.42s -> 14527.62s]  goodness.
[14527.62s -> 14528.62s]  Is this Warcraft?
[14528.62s -> 14529.62s]  Am I playing
[14529.62s -> 14530.62s]  World of Warcraft
[14530.62s -> 14531.62s]  or is this
[14531.62s -> 14535.10s]  an action game?
[14535.10s -> 14536.10s]  Yeah.
[14536.10s -> 14537.10s]  We got him down
[14537.10s -> 14538.10s]  to five percent.
[14538.10s -> 14539.10s]  Yeah.
[14539.10s -> 14540.10s]  Two percent.
[14540.10s -> 14541.10s]  DPS hard.
[14541.10s -> 14542.10s]  Okay.
[14542.10s -> 14543.10s]  Here comes phase two.
[14543.10s -> 14544.10s]  All right.
[14544.10s -> 14545.10s]  This is where...
[14545.10s -> 14546.10s]  The mages
[14546.10s -> 14547.10s]  and the warlocks
[14547.10s -> 14548.10s]  It's been...
[14548.10s -> 14549.10s]  It's been 18 minutes.
[14549.10s -> 14550.10s]  Yup.
[14550.10s -> 14551.10s]  Okay.
[14551.10s -> 14552.10s]  Still fighting.
[14552.10s -> 14591.42s]  One percent.
[14591.42s -> 14592.42s]  Come on.
[14592.42s -> 14593.42s]  You can do it.
[14593.42s -> 14607.02s]  I haven't seen him
[14607.02s -> 14608.02s]  do that.
[14608.02s -> 14624.04s]  I'm already
[14624.04s -> 14625.04s]  not a great start
[14625.04s -> 14626.04s]  but I'll try it.
[14626.04s -> 14638.80s]  Fuck.
[14638.80s -> 14639.80s]  You got too many
[14639.80s -> 14644.24s]  like hairs.
[14644.24s -> 14645.24s]  That was
[14645.24s -> 14646.24s]  an instant kill.
[14646.24s -> 14650.94s]  What?
[14650.94s -> 14652.37s]  In the name of fucking
[14652.37s -> 14654.50s]  God, man.
[14654.50s -> 14665.98s]  Instant kill.
[14665.98s -> 14666.98s]  We got...
[14666.98s -> 14667.98s]  This is optional?
[14667.98s -> 14668.98s]  Well, I've been here
[14668.98s -> 14669.98s]  for long enough.
[14669.98s -> 14670.98s]  I have to do it.
[14670.98s -> 14671.98s]  I know this is probably...
[14671.98s -> 14672.98s]  This is probably
[14672.98s -> 14673.98s]  like this.
[14673.98s -> 14674.98s]  And it's...
[14674.98s -> 14675.98s]  Here it is.
[14675.98s -> 14676.98s]  So, I'm...
[14676.98s -> 14677.98s]  I'm going for it, man.
[14677.98s -> 14678.98s]  I'm already here.
[14678.98s -> 14679.98s]  I got...
[14679.98s -> 14680.98s]  I got him down
[14680.98s -> 14681.98s]  to one bubble.
[14681.98s -> 14701.08s]  I can't just leave.
[14701.08s -> 14702.08s]  Again with this.
[14702.08s -> 14713.82s]  Oh, God damn it.
[14713.82s -> 14714.82s]  Not again.
[14714.82s -> 14721.75s]  Oh, my God.
[14721.75s -> 14726.75s]  It's the bane of my whole existence.
[14726.75s -> 14728.75s]  It is the guaranteed to die
[14728.75s -> 14729.75s]  if it touches you.
[14729.75s -> 14732.75s]  Oh, it's the worst.
[14732.75s -> 14734.75s]  It's the worst.
[14734.75s -> 14735.75s]  It's the worst.
[14735.75s -> 14736.75s]  It's the worst, man.
[14736.75s -> 14737.75s]  It's the worst.
[14737.75s -> 14738.75s]  It's so hard to tell
[14738.75s -> 14739.75s]  when he's going to do it too
[14739.75s -> 14746.56s]  because you got to stay close.
[14746.56s -> 14747.56s]  This motherfucker
[14747.56s -> 14748.56s]  can just pull that
[14748.56s -> 14750.44s]  like a deck of...
[14750.44s -> 14751.44s]  He can just throw it up there
[14751.44s -> 14752.44s]  whenever he wants.
[14752.44s -> 14753.44s]  Let's go.
[14753.44s -> 14754.44s]  I'm doing something.
[14754.44s -> 14769.31s]  Kind of in the ball though.
[14769.31s -> 14779.96s]  At least he hit me a couple of times.
[14779.96s -> 14780.96s]  Balls, right?
[14780.96s -> 14781.96s]  I'm getting the fuck out of here
[14781.96s -> 14790.69s]  when he does this shit, man.
[14790.69s -> 14791.69s]  I honestly cannot believe
[14791.69s -> 14796.70s]  that the stomp hit me.
[14796.70s -> 14797.70s]  This guy is an earth-sized hitbox.
[14797.70s -> 14803.17s]  He...
[14803.17s -> 14804.17s]  He...
[14804.17s -> 14805.17s]  She's so...
[14805.17s -> 14808.07s]  She's so...
[14808.07s -> 14809.07s]  She's so...
[14809.07s -> 14810.07s]  She's so...
[14810.07s -> 14812.08s]  She's so...
[14812.08s -> 14813.08s]  She's so...
[14813.08s -> 14814.08s]  She's so...
[14829.85s -> 14830.85s]  He...
[14830.85s -> 14831.85s]  She stands there
[14831.85s -> 14833.34s]  and he's got
[14833.34s -> 14834.34s]  a hitbox the size
[14834.34s -> 14835.34s]  of a goddamn Jupiter
[14835.34s -> 14841.19s]  around him.
[14841.19s -> 14842.19s]  Holy shit.
[14842.19s -> 14855.13s]  Well,
[14855.13s -> 14856.13s]  do I have anything
[14856.13s -> 14859.22s]  I can do here?
[14859.22s -> 14860.22s]  Is this guy dead?
[14860.22s -> 14865.37s]  Wait, now...
[14865.37s -> 14866.37s]  Why can't I do this?
[14866.37s -> 14869.63s]  I should know how to do this.
[14869.63s -> 14880.94s]  I don't think I have anything, guys.
[14880.94s -> 14882.94s]  Prevents damage from fire attacks,
[14882.94s -> 14883.94s]  but man, I got to go...
[14883.94s -> 14884.94s]  I can't get that right now.
[14884.94s -> 14888.53s]  I got to go from all the way up here
[14888.53s -> 14892.90s]  to get this.
[14892.90s -> 14908.71s]  Let's see what I can do for skills.
[14908.71s -> 14914.34s]  That guy is fucking crazy.
[14914.34s -> 14918.98s]  Well, there had to be one, right?
[14918.98s -> 14919.98s]  Or two?
[14919.98s -> 14923.58s]  Um...
[14923.58s -> 14924.58s]  No, no, no.
[14924.58s -> 14928.45s]  Skills, skills, skills.
[14928.45s -> 14930.62s]  I got six points.
[14930.62s -> 14931.62s]  What am I...
[14931.62s -> 14937.47s]  What do I need here?
[14937.47s -> 14938.47s]  Uh...
[14938.47s -> 14940.84s]  This is less sound.
[14940.84s -> 14944.86s]  It's just more...
[14944.86s -> 14956.25s]  Spirit emblems.
[14956.25s -> 14965.62s]  Fang and blade.
[14965.62s -> 14967.62s]  Midair prosthetic tool.
[14967.62s -> 14981.95s]  I'm not sure what the hell I should buy.
[14981.95s -> 14995.01s]  Well, I'm going to do this.
[14995.01s -> 15003.78s]  Because that will...
[15003.78s -> 15004.78s]  That seems good.
[15004.78s -> 15008.66s]  Forward dash.
[15008.66s -> 15009.66s]  After you use prosthetic,
[15009.66s -> 15010.66s]  you can get close.
[15010.66s -> 15013.89s]  Then these.
[15013.89s -> 15014.89s]  Midair prosthetic.
[15014.89s -> 15018.54s]  Tools while in midair.
[15018.54s -> 15025.64s]  That sounds kind of good, actually.
[15025.64s -> 15037.18s]  What was the other one?
[15037.18s -> 15038.87s]  It was like another...
[15038.87s -> 15039.87s]  It was deflection, right?
[15039.87s -> 15040.87s]  Yeah.
[15040.87s -> 15041.87s]  This one.
[15041.87s -> 15047.46s]  You can deflect in the air.
[15047.46s -> 15048.46s]  That's a huge deal.
[15048.46s -> 15050.46s]  I don't know how the hell I didn't have this.
[15050.46s -> 15056.61s]  And leads to...
[15056.61s -> 15059.55s]  Combat arts while in the air.
[15059.55s -> 15061.56s]  Uh...
[15061.56s -> 15064.02s]  This is kind of good.
[15064.02s -> 15070.10s]  I'm going to hold on to the points, though.
[15070.10s -> 15072.46s]  Because I don't think there's anything else
[15072.46s -> 15073.46s]  I really want here.
[15073.46s -> 15084.92s]  HR slash.
[15084.92s -> 15087.72s]  Living force.
[15087.72s -> 15088.72s]  Shadow rush.
[15088.72s -> 15092.24s]  Unleash a long-range powerful thrust
[15092.24s -> 15094.24s]  and use the impaled opponent as a platform
[15094.24s -> 15096.24s]  to vault into the sky.
[15096.24s -> 15108.15s]  Hmm.
[15108.15s -> 15109.15s]  I don't know.
[15109.15s -> 15110.15s]  I'm not sure.
[15110.15s -> 15118.60s]  I mean, I have to spend them somewhere.
[15118.60s -> 15129.54s]  Attack with the sword and tool simultaneously.
[15129.54s -> 15130.54s]  That's pretty good.
[15130.54s -> 15133.13s]  Midair tool.
[15133.13s -> 15134.13s]  Eh.
[15134.13s -> 15142.98s]  I like this.
[15142.98s -> 15151.56s]  Let me take a look at it.
[15151.56s -> 15154.70s]  Special sword attacks can be performed
[15154.70s -> 15156.70s]  immediately after using prosthetic.
[15156.70s -> 15158.70s]  I can trigger it right afterward to a follow-up attack.
[15158.70s -> 15161.70s]  Actually, I use the firecracker so often.
[15161.70s -> 15169.70s]  What do we got here?
[15169.70s -> 15171.38s]  Floating passage.
[15171.38s -> 15172.38s]  I like it.
[15172.38s -> 15175.39s]  I just took it off.
[15175.39s -> 15183.16s]  Jerma lied about Minecraft VR.
[15183.16s -> 15185.16s]  Thanks for the five community subs.
[15185.16s -> 15187.87s]  Thank you.
[15187.87s -> 15189.43s]  Welcome back.
[15189.43s -> 15191.44s]  All right.
[15191.44s -> 15192.44s]  Where's the...
[15192.44s -> 15193.44s]  Where the hell is the blacksmith?
[15193.44s -> 15198.14s]  I don't have any money.
[15198.14s -> 15200.14s]  I died like ten times.
[15200.14s -> 15208.02s]  But thank you so much, Jerma lied about Minecraft VR.
[15208.02s -> 15214.04s]  Talk to Kuro again.
[15214.04s -> 15218.39s]  Try to talk with the immortal training dude.
[15218.39s -> 15231.73s]  He's dead.
[15231.73s -> 15234.03s]  Secret passage.
[15236.03s -> 15237.03s]  Yeah.
[15243.42s -> 15244.42s]  Give Gord seed.
[15244.42s -> 15245.42s]  Why would I...
[15245.42s -> 15246.42s]  Oh.
[15246.42s -> 15247.42s]  Flug Boy.
[15247.42s -> 15248.42s]  Five community subs in Flug Boy.
[15248.42s -> 15251.43s]  Thank you so much, Flug Boy.
[15259.10s -> 15262.49s]  Single-minded search for strength entered
[15262.49s -> 15263.49s]  and taking the machine for his own.
[15263.49s -> 15266.49s]  This is the result of combining techniques from the styles he encountered.
[15272.67s -> 15273.91s]  Lord Isshin.
[15273.91s -> 15279.05s]  If Sekiro is able to master these, I'd like to duel him.
[15279.05s -> 15280.05s]  Oh, he's dead.
[15280.05s -> 15282.31s]  Please.
[15282.31s -> 15287.80s]  I'll give him this book.
[15287.80s -> 15288.80s]  Wait, so did I...
[15288.80s -> 15294.37s]  He died before we could fight.
[15294.37s -> 15299.36s]  I still haven't beaten Lord Genichiro.
[15299.36s -> 15301.36s]  I just want you to know there are bite marks in my controller
[15301.36s -> 15303.36s]  and I hope you're having a good night.
[15303.36s -> 15305.36s]  This game's rough, man.
[15305.36s -> 15308.75s]  It really is.
[15308.75s -> 15311.18s]  It's a lot of fun, but it is fucking brutal.
[15311.18s -> 15313.18s]  It is super sharp.
[15313.18s -> 15317.51s]  It's like eating the most delicious thing you've ever thought of.
[15317.51s -> 15320.51s]  Think of the most delicious hamburger you could ever eat.
[15320.51s -> 15321.51s]  Oh, my God.
[15321.51s -> 15322.51s]  I love it.
[15322.51s -> 15323.51s]  It's a perfect flavor.
[15323.51s -> 15325.51s]  But the burger's made out of glass.
[15325.51s -> 15329.80s]  That's kind of how this is.
[15340.55s -> 15342.62s]  Jesus.
[15342.62s -> 15346.08s]  Empowered mortal draw.
[15346.08s -> 15347.08s]  How do I even get these?
[15347.08s -> 15348.08s]  Not available.
[15348.08s -> 15351.86s]  Five skill points.
[15351.86s -> 15362.33s]  One can draw, riddling a longer range, more powerful slash attack.
[15362.33s -> 15365.33s]  Draw the sword that cannot be drawn and unleash its devastation.
[15365.33s -> 15366.33s]  Ooh.
[15367.57s -> 15372.52s]  All right.
[15372.52s -> 15375.34s]  Well, I'm not sure.
[15375.34s -> 15376.34s]  I'm not sure what to do.
[15376.34s -> 15379.34s]  Should I keep smashing my head against the wall and try to beat this boss?
[15379.34s -> 15382.34s]  Or should I continue to progress the story in the game?
[15382.34s -> 15398.40s]  Yeah, there was a...
[15398.40s -> 15399.40s]  You know what?
[15399.40s -> 15400.40s]  Here's what we're going to do.
[15400.40s -> 15403.78s]  For the sake of...
[15403.78s -> 15407.34s]  I went by like a few different...
[15407.34s -> 15414.42s]  There's at least two mini bosses that I know that I can fight.
[15414.42s -> 15417.62s]  There's at least a few.
[15417.62s -> 15419.62s]  There's the drunk guy that was out...
[15419.62s -> 15421.62s]  There's like two drunk guys.
[15421.62s -> 15423.24s]  Go kill headless...
[15423.24s -> 15424.24s]  No.
[15424.24s -> 15425.42s]  No.
[15425.42s -> 15426.42s]  No, I can't.
[15426.42s -> 15427.42s]  I can't.
[15427.42s -> 15433.62s]  I can't do it.
[15433.62s -> 15434.93s]  I can't.
[15434.93s -> 15435.93s]  I don't remember where it is.
[15435.93s -> 15441.71s]  So I can't do it.
[15441.71s -> 15442.71s]  It's like here, right?
[15442.71s -> 15448.54s]  Oh, I can't do it.
[15448.54s -> 15449.54s]  Was it hidden forest?
[15449.54s -> 15451.86s]  All right.
[15451.86s -> 15453.86s]  No, this is going to make me so mad.
[15453.86s -> 15456.86s]  Do you see how many times I died at that boss?
[15456.86s -> 15460.06s]  Those of you that were here last night.
[15460.06s -> 15463.30s]  I died like three or four times to this guy.
[15463.30s -> 15466.30s]  And it drove me fucking mental.
[15466.30s -> 15467.30s]  I was so angry.
[15467.30s -> 15472.30s]  I just died like 10 to 15 times to that giant flaming monster.
[15472.30s -> 15474.30s]  And I'm like still fine learning.
[15474.30s -> 15475.30s]  Oh, this is crazy.
[15475.30s -> 15476.30s]  Wow.
[15476.30s -> 15477.61s]  What a move.
[15477.61s -> 15482.43s]  This is going to ruin the stream.
[15482.43s -> 15483.43s]  This is going to ruin the stream.
[15483.43s -> 15484.43s]  And I know it.
[15484.43s -> 15485.43s]  Okay.
[15485.43s -> 15487.43s]  I'm going to preemptively make sure that it doesn't ruin the stream.
[15487.43s -> 15491.08s]  You hear me talking right now?
[15491.08s -> 15494.08s]  I'm going to make sure that I'm preemptively making sure this is not going to ruin the stream.
[15494.08s -> 15497.22s]  I'm going to be positive about this.
[15497.22s -> 15499.93s]  I'm just going down.
[15499.93s -> 15501.23s]  I'm going to fight him.
[15501.23s -> 15502.23s]  Fuck items.
[15502.23s -> 15503.23s]  We're just going to fight him.
[15503.23s -> 15504.23s]  All right.
[15504.23s -> 15505.23s]  I'm ready.
[15505.23s -> 15506.60s]  I'm not going to get angry with this guy.
[15533.74s -> 15544.15s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[15544.15s -> 15548.78s]  Where is it?
[15548.78s -> 15549.78s]  I have it.
[15549.78s -> 15550.78s]  It's right here.
[15550.78s -> 15553.24s]  I have five of these.
[15553.24s -> 15554.24s]  No, I can't do this yet.

[16546.07s -> 16550.27s]  the terror otherwise this is just a no-go
[16551.27s -> 16582.11s]  I thought he swings again as long as you keep moving it's really not that
[16582.11s -> 16587.75s]  big of a deal but I could use some of those pacifying agents
[16587.75s -> 16617.42s]  yeah the big ones that turned midway through hitting that ball curved in
[16617.42s -> 16631.70s]  the air twice take a while but
[16631.70s -> 16639.06s]  well I know what he does I was scared last time I was here if I come here
[16639.06s -> 16669.04s]  prepared watch out watch out let's go I don't want to use a confetti not
[16669.08s -> 16673.76s]  yet I could just use it and get screwed
[16677.55s -> 16706.91s]  nice relaxing but whoa big one let's get the items that's a scrap metal

[16746.84s -> 16762.36s]  this is I need a place to save myself here
[16766.36s -> 16775.69s]  that was a mistake it was a huge mistake I just came in here completely
[16775.69s -> 16778.85s]  unprepared and thought I could kill him somehow but he moved I for some
[16778.85s -> 16781.33s]  reason I didn't think he was gonna move and I had that like little
[16781.33s -> 16786.52s]  cheese strat no all right well I'm not gonna do it again until I have
[16786.84s -> 16800.06s]  some pacifying things or something to stop that the umbrella upgrade I don't
[16800.06s -> 16808.57s]  have I don't think I have the umbrella upgrade confetti will kill him in like
[16808.57s -> 16812.09s]  six hits yeah but the problem is just if I get touched by anything it just
[16812.09s -> 16816.37s]  instantly died that terror just get dead I'd rather have at least the
[16816.37s -> 16829.90s]  papers there was a somebody sold one of those where is it when they're a
[16829.90s -> 16842.98s]  guy me boo me boo village me boo manor village there was a guy that sold a

[16859.90s -> 16864.50s]  yeah there it is model purple gourd reduces terror buildup and increases
[16864.50s -> 16874.37s]  terror resistance and he sells confetti okay what I got for money how
[16874.37s -> 16885.16s]  much was it 1800 buck man that's so much am I really gonna spend every
[16885.16s -> 16898.84s]  cent I own to get this and then some and we sell on it so I need to sell
[16898.84s -> 16908.38s]  some like ash or something too this is really good put me over there can I'm

[16998.81s -> 17004.62s]  twenty nine thirty thirty thirty seconds that's a lot longer than I
[17004.62s -> 17020.64s]  thought it was sure let's go let me just see how much does it reduce it's
[17020.64s -> 17026.46s]  pretty it's pretty decent it's pretty decent
[17026.58s -> 17032.57s]  that's actually great all right so now I'm just making sure I have confidence
[17032.57s -> 17044.19s]  to use the confetti because really I can just get in there and just beat the shit out of me right there like right there like he'd be
[17044.19s -> 17060.16s]  dead yeah who cares maybe well let's you know do it let's go say let him
[17060.16s -> 17102.59s]  land you didn't like that again he's gonna do the blast again is me all

[17123.42s -> 17129.44s]  hill to converts vitality into spirit emblems originally this time to was
[17129.44s -> 17132.08s]  used in a ritual offering at the dragon in which an emblem will be cut from
[17132.08s -> 17142.02s]  one's own life force okay so that's that's the self-harm for pellets in
[17142.02s -> 17157.94s]  bloodborne okay so the other one is down in I really would rather have
[17157.94s -> 17166.77s]  prayer beads to be honest yeah well I got another confetti and I have
[17166.77s -> 17180.00s]  another I have plenty of gourds so what does the other one drop let's go
[17180.00s -> 17186.21s]  kill the other one he's like right here right what's a good place to go
[17186.21s -> 17214.06s]  over here because it's another one of these guys back this way okay he's
[17214.06s -> 17224.50s]  under here
[17224.74s -> 17229.58s]  in the waterfall right he's like right here all right let's make sure I
[17229.58s -> 17264.38s]  don't get chased the spawns are right in here it is I think I even have that

[18779.53s -> 18790.41s]  tricky across the game I mean it's possible maybe to pull just him if I
[18790.41s -> 18793.13s]  cleared these guys first which I mean it's like four people though it's not
[18793.13s -> 18809.74s]  different it's actually maybe these guys have cannons and shit too

[21761.89s -> 21774.68s]  reason I found it I found it that's what they're talking about the whole game I
[21774.68s -> 21777.92s]  found it there it is this the thing that I can walk through I can go
[21777.92s -> 21783.83s]  through that door that's the painted door thing I can go through there

[21917.28s -> 21923.12s]  the Bell strengthening enemies around them the Bell demon confers hardship
[21923.12s -> 21926.40s]  but perhaps also slightly better spoils using this item is no particular effect
[21926.40s -> 21934.07s]  the second causing the demon to leave wait this is this is this everything's
[21934.07s -> 21943.88s]  just harder what wait a minute strengthening enemies around them gives
[21943.88s -> 21957.61s]  so you make the game harder but there's a hard mode for secure holy

[24660.61s -> 24702.93s]  everywhere the fuck Jesus anything else what's this all right get this monster
[24702.93s -> 24711.04s]  away from me get out of here these guys are just sitting in here all game
[24711.04s -> 24722.56s]  where is he oh god this stupid fish is here too
[24722.56s -> 24737.39s]  no stop diving out of the water just get everything he's gonna he only has
[24737.39s -> 24775.14s]  one bar I hope that was a terrible place to drink and I know it goes
[24775.14s -> 24793.28s]  keep doing the wave your hair move grab that's the easiest thing to
[24793.32s -> 24795.32s]  dodge
[24795.56s -> 24819.40s]  greedy okay that was so much easier than the other ones no fog wall with no
[24819.40s -> 24832.65s]  dodging consume okay this is just another one of these reduces vitality
[24832.65s -> 24835.21s]  damage taken from physical attacks consume spirit of those to use
[24835.21s -> 24843.08s]  repeatedly so these are just candies that I can use whenever I want but
[24843.08s -> 24849.24s]  that's not really what I'm looking for I wanted beads I've killed like
[24849.28s -> 24853.88s]  okay since the demon I've killed like four or five mini bosses and I'm only
[24853.88s -> 24866.51s]  got one beat nothing else down here did I beat the red demon no I stopped
[24866.51s -> 24872.35s]  fighting against the red demon and I started doing other content to take a
[24872.35s -> 24881.56s]  break from it I was hopefully going to get some more stats but doesn't
[24881.56s -> 24891.66s]  seem like that's the case at the moment I got you got the jump on you
[24892.22s -> 24933.10s]  yet the elbow drop all right opportunity comes knocking no I couldn't get a
[24933.10s -> 24939.19s]  stealth been a while since I fought you what the hell you got like grabs and
[24939.19s -> 24952.46s]  shit right I remember this guy you don't pair you just kind of dance
[24952.46s -> 24960.64s]  around it goes over these grabs take the item that's not good he lost the
[24960.64s -> 24987.82s]  lock on there all right so far so good do something do something do something
[24987.82s -> 25003.12s]  do something do something do something fine I will still going I'm still flying
[25003.12s -> 25015.35s]  I'm still going what am I gonna end up here swimming and he's dead he
[25015.35s -> 25027.36s]  speared me through the mouth I went through it he just like that was
[25027.36s -> 25037.52s]  fucking bullshit I had that going to just fine all right well now that's
[25037.52s -> 25041.28s]  kind of the nail in the coffin for me I think no it's not let me kill that
[25041.28s -> 25080.96s]  guy I thought I could sneak up on finish the game today I don't know
[25080.96s -> 25104.14s]  that's gonna be tricky man so I don't think that's possible
[25104.18s -> 25130.02s]  crack here boom boom well it does have a little funky of a hitbox and I remember
[25130.02s -> 25150.83s]  Wow that was damn too funky with it just kill him I'm trying to be too
[25150.83s -> 25154.87s]  fancy with it like just fucking it's a tiny room and I'm it's but just

[25557.90s -> 25562.15s]  just kind of feudal behavior what I'm doing right now I'm right back
[25562.15s -> 25744.18s]  gonna pee and we'll fight the demon again we'll try I had to get a glass of
[25744.18s -> 25757.90s]  water too all right I'm ready to give it a couple solid tries so let's just go
[25757.90s -> 25775.01s]  let me change this one three of these although what about some of these
[25775.01s -> 25791.29s]  things this is now this is stealth this is vitality damage I might be
[25791.29s -> 25800.91s]  worth using these if they take spirits but all my tools are although
[25800.91s -> 25807.90s]  what my finger whistle didn't I get something I got like a new thing for
[25807.90s -> 25820.50s]  the didn't I get a finger whistle upgrade or something what was it wasn't
[25820.50s -> 25832.58s]  it like oh do this to a beast and always a ring okay is it one of those
[25832.58s -> 25854.85s]  scenarios where I have to upgrade it let's do this first that's a lot more
[25854.85s -> 25873.38s]  health and vitality okay great this is five not available why oh I need
[25873.38s -> 25899.90s]  this to let me go let me go to look at the upgrade screen how am I doing I'm
[25899.90s -> 25918.10s]  doing good hope you're doing good how are you yeah okay so you actually have
[25918.10s -> 25931.79s]  to upgrade it through the tree shit I mean I can get it I can actually get
[25931.79s -> 25946.98s]  this it's gonna cost some money buy three of these thousand bucks and
[25947.02s -> 25955.97s]  then I can do it can be used to drive beasts mad into torment apparition type
[25955.97s -> 25964.50s]  enemies I wonder how much that is for materials though if that's but that
[25964.50s -> 25971.00s]  doesn't seem like that much I can still do this I'm gonna go for it so
[25971.00s -> 25977.08s]  it's six hundred sixteen hundred twenty seven three that's a lot of
[25977.08s -> 25990.60s]  money do I have that money what do I have for money right now two thousand
[25991.04s -> 26002.28s]  I got the money hmm I got the money let's do it how much do I need exactly I
[26002.28s -> 26017.26s]  need 18 let's see let's do the actual math here so I need this and then
[26017.26s -> 26032.90s]  this what does this do so this actually I could have used this an hour ago so
[26032.90s -> 26039.08s]  I need to buy three gunpowders which you should have them over here
[26039.08s -> 26047.60s]  protects from terror that would have been great
[26055.60s -> 26064.54s]  no not a state don't go anywhere I need you here to sell me things so it was I
[26064.54s -> 26076.36s]  know it's iron so I needed three of these please notice me hey how are you
[26076.56s -> 26096.38s]  so that's three 450 I think I should still have enough money panic okay I
[26096.38s -> 26106.30s]  need another 200 bucks you're killing me here you're killing me whatever I
[26106.30s -> 26119.85s]  need to do this anyways we go now I need $1,200
[26119.85s -> 26138.66s]  twelve hundred so that's a thousand five ten fifteen I'm just gonna have to sell
[26138.66s -> 26152.49s]  some shit because I can do no I don't need to it's gonna ease into the pack
[26152.49s -> 26164.64s]  whatever else I'll buy something else too here it is I hope this is worth it
[26164.64s -> 26171.94s]  drive beast mad into torment apparition type enemies I hope this
[26171.94s -> 26177.81s]  horse doing this is a lot of money and there's a lot of resources it's
[26177.81s -> 26207.16s]  done malcontent mal-cun-tent so if it was worth it I wonder how it works
[26207.16s -> 26220.46s]  and how much I got some money let's go back here I'm gonna buy I'm just gonna
[26220.46s -> 26224.90s]  buy like I'm gonna buy one of these just in case for some reason this guy
[26224.90s -> 26228.66s]  goes away what else do I have antidote powder five I got plenty
[26228.66s -> 26236.78s]  antidote pacify let's get another one of these in fact I think yeah I'm you
[26236.78s -> 26239.26s]  know just because I'm just gonna do it I you might think I'm fucking
[26240.26s -> 26255.22s]  you mean you think he's crazy but I I want like more of these I know I have
[26255.22s -> 26266.54s]  the potion but I still I think they're so useful now it's time for an attempt
[26266.54s -> 26275.10s]  let me look at the upgrade screen one more time I want this I can do this I
[26275.10s -> 26279.66s]  just need 1,500 and I need one more of those salt packets it's my
[26279.66s -> 26288.32s]  favorite item in the game over here is this is the fire attack one but I can't
[26288.32s -> 26295.71s]  even get this even if I wanted to I'm apparently missing a prosthetic tool
[26295.71s -> 26300.47s]  which I would have to go one two three four five and then it unlocks
[26300.47s -> 26311.94s]  this so I can't get this we're gonna have to go for it with what I got I
[26311.94s -> 26317.94s]  don't have that tool I don't know what it is I don't know where it is
[26317.94s -> 26323.74s]  let's see what I like I'm gonna scream it's not gonna be that much longer I'm
[26323.74s -> 26335.19s]  just gonna try we'll go again tomorrow try to clean it up finish it all up so
[26335.19s -> 26357.60s]  it was what was it flames of hatred let's see I'm I there was a list was
[26357.60s -> 26364.76s]  a lot of money I want to see what this does demon of hatred what does it
[26364.76s -> 26380.30s]  do pretty useful pretty useful how often can I do that I wonder if it's
[26380.30s -> 26396.46s]  gonna cool down what's the how far away I can do from pretty far away and it's
[26396.46s -> 26416.82s]  alright it's not bad can I do it again immediately can okay so just want to
[26416.82s -> 26437.98s]  see what did wasting spirit emblems I got plenty of spirit I've been
[26437.98s -> 26441.86s]  collecting them the whole game haven't I all right here we go let's go
[26441.90s -> 26456.75s]  oh thanks unseen aid then go oh it's just random shit here guys we're just going through some weird shit
[26456.75s -> 26497.05s]  thought I blocked it ah shit a little rusty a little rusty
[26497.05s -> 26518.80s]  going uphill though I don't like this
[26518.80s -> 26571.55s]  just gonna back it up, back it up, throw him, touch out, it's a cocky pun
[26591.10s -> 26605.90s]  that was close man god damn it fucking hell come on it's that one move that
[26605.90s -> 26622.02s]  sucks it just does that move sucks that's an undeniably fucking shit
[26622.02s -> 26655.10s]  should have waited
[26655.50s -> 26681.93s]  you got next level man on phase two he doesn't throw the balls anymore he
[26681.93s -> 26720.83s]  does that weird I don't know how to get the first two I got to get the first
[26720.83s -> 26740.29s]  phase down a long way to go like it's like that move is it just lingers for
[26740.29s -> 26746.62s]  the hitbox lingers for so long even when he's even if you dodge it so if
[26746.62s -> 26751.74s]  you dodge it even with i-frames for like a tenth of a second two tenths
[26751.74s -> 26762.63s]  of a second after it hits you it's almost like you should maybe even just run to
[26762.63s -> 26768.06s]  his right I don't think that movie I don't think you can dodge parry I don't
[26768.06s -> 26770.46s]  think you have to just get away from that move it's so hard to determine
[26770.46s -> 26774.42s]  what's gonna happen because it takes a not even a second to do it he's
[26774.42s -> 26780.05s]  just like yeah so you can be just you brain decides in a second and you
[26780.05s -> 26800.66s]  have to dodge it just because it happens so quickly there it is again
[26800.66s -> 26815.21s]  see what I mean it's just so quickly it's hard to react to and that was
[26815.21s -> 26915.35s]  with the fire resistance fuck I don't like it there it is all right no he
[26915.35s -> 26936.17s]  doesn't both ways I don't know man you gotta run left it I can you know I feel
[26936.17s -> 26962.12s]  like I don't I'm not sure I can the jump it might be a jump over that there
[26962.12s -> 26968.17s]  might be dead I just barely got to heal up
[26970.03s -> 26996.90s]  unforgiving I can't I can't stop for a second fucker there it is again the
[26996.90s -> 27005.63s]  unfucking bearable move that is one of the only things I take damage to I'm
[27005.63s -> 27012.93s]  thinking I dodged backwards I'm gonna try dodging back to see if doesn't
[27012.93s -> 27029.45s]  it I guess you can jump in the grab I wanted to do the moves I can just try
[27029.45s -> 27037.39s]  to dodge backwards
[27037.47s -> 27060.94s]  I'm gonna try to parry it let's see what happens let's see if I can trigger him
[27060.94s -> 27074.21s]  to do it do it
[27079.03s -> 27139.02s]  waiting for him to do it Barry all right can't all right it's I can do
[27139.02s -> 27145.66s]  it all I can walk it all but in like game time scenario though that I guess
[27145.66s -> 27152.31s]  that's better than me dodging and fucking dying I feel like game time
[27152.31s -> 27164.94s]  scenario it's he does it so fast I should practice it right
[27164.94s -> 27200.18s]  I really want to crack at that it's worth it but man the timings are so odd
[27200.18s -> 27204.22s]  it's like here punch
[27206.62s -> 27223.74s]  that's just such odd timing okay how did I not get hit by that
[27223.74s -> 27243.98s]  the ultimate ultra hitbox got me that other time
[27244.26s -> 27261.04s]  this guy's rough I wonder I wonder what my official orphan of cost was the
[27261.04s -> 27266.09s]  hardest boss if ever played in a video game I wonder how many attempts
[27270.18s -> 27284.53s]  I wonder how many it's gonna take for this I remember when I I remember me and
[27284.53s -> 27291.13s]  star could not be orphaned together we tried dozens of times to be orphan
[27291.33s -> 27297.58s]  I finally did it by myself and it was like holy shit it's the
[27297.58s -> 27304.26s]  hardest thing but I'm starting to get that vibe of this might be that from
[27304.26s -> 27311.06s]  this game this guy's just so it's so easy to die he's got so many
[27311.06s -> 27317.45s]  interesting moves he's got three full ball bubbles this dude is no joke
[27317.45s -> 27331.85s]  and I definitely probably beat orphan by this without a doubt because this
[27331.85s -> 27366.25s]  has to be upwards of like 20 to 30 attempts on this guy right
[27366.33s -> 27372.06s]  three or just four swings there
[27377.73s -> 27389.45s]  mainly just use this practice down to try to block those four times it's a
[27389.45s -> 27392.73s]  sponginess that makes him this heart yeah he's got a dickload of health I
[27392.73s -> 27408.70s]  can do this three times I've also seen people say hey just get get the
[27408.70s -> 27414.34s]  flame I don't have it and like I have to go get an item that I don't
[27414.90s -> 27420.78s]  what I have with my I didn't get that item so I got a fight of the way that I
[27420.78s -> 27445.62s]  know how also I mean I got I'm gonna have to come back stronger this is this
[27445.62s -> 27449.18s]  is one of the hardest bosses in the game and I'm like eight hours what
[27449.18s -> 27456.02s]  seven hours eight hours playing the whole day I gotta come back fresh
[27457.34s -> 27477.62s]  because at some point you know you get used to get sloppy and this this
[27477.62s -> 27482.06s]  dude optional probably top three bosses in the game has to be top all right
[27482.06s -> 27487.75s]  I'll tell you I've how many bosses are after this guy they can't be more than
[27487.75s -> 27492.11s]  like it I'm almost I have to be at the end of the game I have to be nobody
[27492.11s -> 27497.80s]  gave me this much trouble I think I'm gonna I'm it's gonna be tricky for me
[27497.80s -> 27506.67s]  to do this now haven't even fought any of the bosses they're all still
[27506.67s -> 27517.93s]  alive practice it kind of all right
[27517.93s -> 27529.85s]  a little bit there and also maybe don't even be afraid to now the chip damn
[27529.85s -> 27580.15s]  just too much bye last one sucks ha ha ha fucking drive me crazy the issue
[27580.15s -> 27582.95s]  with this boss is that it's a Dark Souls boss in a game with a shitty
[27582.95s -> 27589.35s]  role yeah yeah that's true but technically can
[27589.35s -> 27595.23s]  parry everything that he does so it is like a Dark Souls I'm the like
[27595.23s -> 27602.24s]  cleric beast boss but it can be beaten by the tools they give you it's just
[27602.24s -> 27606.60s]  really hard to get yourself in that brain especially considering the
[27606.60s -> 27641.62s]  obvious that you want to fight this guy like Dark Souls boss that time I
[27641.62s -> 27647.53s]  still taking damage though so I took a lot of damage doing that I guess
[27647.53s -> 27666.95s]  it's better than dying all right I'll do I'll try now this this would be it

[28241.85s -> 28249.49s]  playing minecraft on times five speed for three days straight but that's the
[28249.49s -> 28257.48s]  nature of the game gonna fuck I'm gonna be I'm gonna beat him eventually who is

[28945.46s -> 28949.26s]  excited about playing this game and then they click on the stream and they

[29036.32s -> 29039.92s]  around in an old Volvo wearing your dressing gown in a pine park in vacant
[29039.92s -> 29048.63s]  parking lots while eating Big Macs and laugh at Garfield comics probably yeah
[29048.63s -> 29055.91s]  whole of one zombie thanks for the 250 and he says I kept this for some
[29055.91s -> 29072.48s]  reason what I don't understand why look at that first like look at the
[29072.52s -> 29077.28s]  okay stop it at like three or four frames in I've got like a people's
[29077.28s -> 29092.94s]  eyebrow thing going here with the gets crazed face terrible thank you
[29092.94s -> 29097.62s]  whole of one's army I don't know why he kept that either thank you
[29097.62s -> 29110.16s]  schwarzer rid for the five dolls haha you're so awkward ha ha but that
[29110.16s -> 29116.04s]  wasn't an ad that wasn't a ha ha that was just an ha ha that wasn't the
[29116.04s -> 29125.92s]  emote one that was just ha ha but thank you Schwartz hey effect tater thanks
[29125.92s -> 29130.69s]  to the ten bucks effect tater hey chat did you know that you can get 2500 bits
[29130.69s -> 29135.49s]  for $25 until the 31st twitch ain't taking any cuts from it so if you use
[29135.49s -> 29145.44s]  bits hop on it that's pretty cool wish it was that good of a deal
[29145.44s -> 29150.88s]  always that is the one thing that I really don't like about bits one
[29150.88s -> 29158.83s]  thing it's just if you buy less than like 20 30 dollars of bits it's
[29158.87s -> 29162.43s]  like it you have to pay like a 20 30 percent premium for like anything less
[29162.43s -> 29169.35s]  than five bucks that just shouldn't be like that I really don't in my opinion
[29169.35s -> 29176.56s]  I don't believe that that should be like that it's actually you're paying
[29176.56s -> 29180.83s]  money to pay money you know you get you pay it's it's like a it's like
[29180.83s -> 29190.99s]  currency trading a dollar is like a dollar thirty it's weird then allow
[29190.99s -> 29196.21s]  PayPal I don't want to do PayPal PayPal's messy donations of messy I
[29196.21s -> 29200.90s]  see so many horror stories so many people and like tax purposes it's
[29200.90s -> 29211.77s]  really hard to it's just strange you see these people that stream they get like
[29211.77s -> 29216.82s]  a $500 donation and they transfer the money to their bank account well they
[29216.82s -> 29220.34s]  use it and then there's a chargeback and they have to come up with 500
[29220.34s -> 29224.72s]  bucks and they may have already spent it so it's just I don't really I
[29224.72s -> 29229.02s]  don't want to even deal with it and then the idea is well just wait like
[29229.02s -> 29238.04s]  90 days so you can use the money no I'd rather just not have to worry
[29238.04s -> 29248.35s]  about it but I do wish it was a little less I don't I wish it wasn't 30% or 20
[29248.35s -> 29263.29s]  was a 28% for a dollar Bitcoin I tried Ethereum we don't talk about that
[29263.29s -> 29272.08s]  anymore remember when I had an Ethereum link down there two people
[29272.08s -> 29275.54s]  used it you can even go on you can go on the blockchain if you have that
[29275.54s -> 29280.78s]  old address go on the blockchain and see like the two or three people one
[29280.78s -> 29284.90s]  person gave me like four dollars and one person gave me like a dollar it
[29284.94s -> 29291.72s]  was there for months and months nobody used it so I just got rid of it and then
[29291.72s -> 29302.80s]  obviously the cryptocurrency took a nosedive that's very sweet of them yeah
[29302.80s -> 29307.08s]  it was cool it was cool to see like oh look that came in through like the
[29307.08s -> 29317.39s]  Ethereum blockchain that's so cool hey smelly boy thanks to the 250 you
[29317.39s -> 29320.15s]  took a fight from a fair but challenging boss fight that you were
[29320.15s -> 29324.07s]  getting better at each time to try and fight a bullshit many boss that
[29324.07s -> 29330.20s]  you knew would get you tilted no you took a break from a fair but
[29330.20s -> 29334.48s]  challenging boss fight that you're getting better at to fight the bullshit
[29334.48s -> 29344.04s]  mini boss and I killed him yeah but I was I really prepared for it though
[29344.04s -> 29349.09s]  during that I got the two snake hearts which I don't know what the hell to
[29349.09s -> 29351.77s]  do with those but I still have them and that's interesting got to see
[29351.77s -> 29356.65s]  that content right I wouldn't have probably done that and bless I went
[29356.65s -> 29360.45s]  if I had just beat that boss like let's say I spent like two three
[29360.45s -> 29365.85s]  hours straight while I was still not succumbing to gamer fatigue I was
[29365.85s -> 29369.09s]  still doing that and I beat eventually and I did it I wouldn't have seen the
[29369.09s -> 29376.38s]  snake stuff I would have kept going to the final part of the game so I'm glad
[29376.38s -> 29379.46s]  I got to I got some more beads I got some more items I got to see more stuff
[29379.46s -> 29388.16s]  but yes that did happen you're right show wars are read thanks for the
[29388.16s -> 29392.63s]  five dollars by the way that's awkward for non boomers there's a lot of

[29433.91s -> 29438.36s]  reddit everybody does all of you do it you were just on like our games
[29438.36s -> 29442.48s]  fucking ten minutes ago looking at the latest trailer and you're gonna like you
[29442.48s -> 29452.84s]  guys because some of you guys are gonna ha ha me on that it's reddit it's like
[29452.84s -> 29457.48s]  one of the most viewed sites on earth that's like saying I checked Facebook
[29457.48s -> 29463.65s]  before the stream and it's like yeah Facebook really haha haha that's how it
[29463.65s -> 29472.38s]  goes right but I it's okay whatever don't let it get to you don't let it
[29472.38s -> 29480.61s]  get to you but thank you peek a banana for the five dollars I'm so
[29480.61s -> 29483.19s]  glad I was able to catch the tail end of the stream after missing most of it
[29483.19s -> 29489.53s]  looking forward to watching you beat the final boss term heart me too I'm
[29489.53s -> 29493.45s]  looking forward to it but I'm I'm I might be dragging the secure of
[29493.45s -> 29498.12s]  streams out a little bit maybe there's this one at the end and I you know
[29498.12s -> 29501.44s]  that gamer depression you guys know I'm talking about when there's a new
[29501.44s -> 29505.80s]  great insanely difficult fun title like this only comes around once every
[29505.80s -> 29510.42s]  three four years and I can see the tunnel the light at the end of the
[29510.42s -> 29517.78s]  tunnels there and I know it's gonna end and it I just I don't want it to end I
[29517.78s -> 29524.06s]  know it's going to and then when it's done that's it and that was fun it was
[29524.06s -> 29533.91s]  fun because a game like this there's not very many reasons to play it more
[29533.91s -> 29541.93s]  than a couple times because there's no character progression right but there's
[29541.93s -> 29545.33s]  no character oh I'm gonna use this weapon this time and they do this
[29545.33s -> 29552.99s]  build there's the skills but you can get most of them anyways that I think there
[29552.99s -> 29556.75s]  might be a couple of optional things you can do maybe with a second
[29556.75s -> 29563.55s]  playthrough no multiplayer so no PvP no PvP builds no building a character
[29563.55s -> 29569.04s]  and playing through the game again it's not there so with this one in
[29569.04s -> 29572.22s]  particular there's the replay abilities not there that much so it's
[29572.22s -> 29576.29s]  kind of hard to attempt to do like a second or third even play for
[29576.29s -> 29582.98s]  anyways so that's the sad part about the end of security is it really is
[29582.98s -> 29592.54s]  just the end of playing securo so I'm taking my time with it you know all good
[29592.54s -> 29597.17s]  things have to come to an end yeah that's true but this one comes to an
[29597.17s -> 29605.22s]  end much quicker than like for instance let's say Dark Souls 3 eyes for I saw
[29605.22s -> 29610.12s]  myself even when we did Dark Souls 3 and I got to the end I knew I knew it
[29610.12s -> 29613.60s]  immediately I was gonna play through with a sorcerer I was gonna play
[29613.60s -> 29618.00s]  through with a strength weapon I was gonna try to do PvP like I had like
[29618.00s -> 29620.56s]  at least three or four more reasons to play through the whole I played through
[29620.56s -> 29625.40s]  the game like three or four five times I'm not getting that I'm not gonna do
[29625.40s -> 29633.68s]  that again here I might play through this one more time to see if I missed
[29633.68s -> 29646.99s]  anything but I you know what I'm saying you got a full VOD to look
[29646.99s -> 29652.92s]  forward to okay well thank you oh you missed you missed some strange
[29652.92s -> 29660.38s]  stuff tonight I got taken I got possessed by fucking gamer demon I got
[29660.38s -> 29670.35s]  taken over I went fucking nuts I was screaming and Chad and shit I mean I
[29670.35s -> 29673.72s]  don't know if you guys weren't here but Kibo if you weren't here I was
[29673.72s -> 29678.84s]  screaming at Chad I was making I was making all these horrible accusations I
[29678.84s -> 29681.88s]  was at a ten at a ten of anger we were fucking screaming at each other I
[29681.88s -> 29687.97s]  lost like fucking 22,000 followers tonight I kept saying unfollow me
[29687.97s -> 29692.97s]  unfollow me I said it like ten times in a row I started smashing my
[29693.01s -> 29698.68s]  fucking hands on my desk unfollow me somebody said like you suck at this boss
[29698.68s -> 29702.44s]  and I fucking banned him I started banning people every time somebody said
[29702.44s -> 29705.32s]  that I wasn't good at the game I would I banned them and I said unfollow me
[29705.32s -> 29709.82s]  fuck you it went off for like 45 straight minutes it's terrible I'm
[29709.82s -> 29735.89s]  embarrassed about this who is this streamer even for anyways let's put
[29735.89s -> 29738.98s]  the credits on we only have a couple more bits to go through this is the
[29738.98s -> 29743.66s]  most neurotic I've ever been let's listen to it this is when I started
[29743.66s -> 29746.34s]  banning people yeah let's watch this this is when I started going unfollow
[29746.34s -> 29754.04s]  me unfollow me ban ban ban unfollow me fuck you I was screaming it it was

[29856.42s -> 29865.65s]  know I'm surprised you didn't have that part in the clip you get
[29865.65s -> 29869.09s]  self-conscious hearing yourself now it's been too long it's been too many
[29869.09s -> 29874.88s]  years maybe originally it was kind of like yeah I don't really yeah nobody
[29874.88s -> 29878.40s]  likes the sound of their own voice when it's playback and recording
[29878.40s -> 29884.50s]  they've done studies on that shit but nah whatever at this point it's been
[29884.50s -> 29892.94s]  like eight years I did it's just kind of there anyway here come the credits
[29892.94s -> 29896.14s]  and we only have a few more there was a lot of subs tons of community subs

[29966.28s -> 29977.61s]  the next game and if it sucks monster rancher 2 is on backup I'm
[29977.65s -> 29982.94s]  feeling that's gonna be a nice relaxing stream after all this madness at VR
[29982.94s -> 29989.00s]  Josh 250 thank you VR Josh few minutes ago I started my own secure Oh
[29989.00s -> 29991.72s]  playthrough and I'm kind of in awe at how well you've handled some of these
[29991.72s -> 29995.44s]  bosses on another note when's the next VR stream plan do you have a list
[29995.44s -> 30001.57s]  of games ready or you still looking for recommendations I have first of
[30001.57s -> 30009.10s]  all thank you secure oh is very very hard but as long as you can take
[30009.14s -> 30014.61s]  the pain you will push through eventually as long as you just relax you take a
[30014.61s -> 30019.96s]  break like for me right you guys just go you have to leave I can't just sit
[30019.96s -> 30024.42s]  there and fucking bash my head against the desk you got to come back you
[30024.42s -> 30028.40s]  got to leave and come back stronger take a break come back the next day
[30028.40s -> 30032.32s]  these are games that are not designed for you to beat in one sitting and
[30032.32s -> 30036.12s]  yes I know that there's people that play these games and they beat it in
[30036.12s -> 30040.00s]  like 45 minutes they're exceptionally talented video game players and they
[30040.00s -> 30046.32s]  are not even human with their reaction times and with their memorization but
[30046.32s -> 30060.01s]  that ain't me I don't claim to be that I do envy it sometimes because it's
[30060.01s -> 30064.39s]  remarkable what some of these guys are able to do but you got to take a
[30064.39s -> 30076.70s]  break here come back again those are real gamers yeah I know these it's
[30076.70s -> 30083.30s]  tough but okay it's like playing these from software games okay there's
[30083.30s -> 30089.26s]  gonna be like a Boy Scouts Sekiro badge I get I get to wear the Boy Scout
[30089.26s -> 30102.72s]  Sekiro badge when I get to the end right it's gonna be right next to you
[30102.72s -> 30108.03s]  ready here's I got like the whole thing here I got my flair Minecraft 4
[30108.03s -> 30114.06s]  Horseman in VR I got that one flame lurker first try that one's gold I
[30114.06s -> 30119.50s]  had that one embroidered beating Sekiro simply completing Sekiro that's
[30119.50s -> 30133.06s]  worth it doing the bonus round in point blank incredibly defied that's that
[30133.06s -> 30149.46s]  one's all that one's silver I wear these every day but for a moment these
[30149.46s -> 30152.34s]  these games are so popular within you know who's this game for right we
[30152.34s -> 30158.20s]  made that was funny and that that joke was was great or even if it wasn't a
[30158.20s -> 30163.08s]  joke when you eventually get to the end you do get to say I got to the
[30163.08s -> 30168.74s]  end and it was crazy it was fucking insanely difficult but I'm I did it I
[30168.78s -> 30175.46s]  made it they should have a t-shirt that you can buy only if you have a Steam
[30175.46s -> 30179.66s]  achievement that you completed the final encounter and it unlocks a t-shirt you
[30179.66s -> 30184.10s]  can buy that's like Sekiro got good right they would make so much money
[30184.10s -> 30195.70s]  think about the amount of people that would buy that shirt I got good and
[30195.70s -> 30198.86s]  it's like a cool design of Sekiro swinging his sword in a circle
[30198.86s -> 30209.47s]  do another hour of stream please no I'll be I'll be left tomorrow I'll be
[30209.47s -> 30214.93s]  like before you know it it's almost almost tomorrow anyways I got good at
[30214.93s -> 30219.52s]  Sekiro and all I got is this lousy t-shirt people would just put the
[30219.52s -> 30227.08s]  shirt on eBay it's not 1940 anymore grandpa everyone can make t-shirts
[30227.08s -> 30231.32s]  yeah but if it's officially licensed with an officially licensed tag from
[30231.32s -> 30251.87s]  software this game I'm looking forward to tomorrow kind of I'm also not
[30251.87s -> 30255.51s]  looking forward to tomorrow it's like this weird angel and devil scenario I
[30255.99s -> 30261.51s]  have to beat the demon I have to and I could see the wall I'm looking up as
[30261.51s -> 30267.86s]  high and I could climb it I got to get good and get the t-shirt I'll be ready
[30267.86s -> 30270.82s]  I'm gonna I'm good to go I'm gonna get a nice fucking caramel macchiato
[30270.82s -> 30277.26s]  from Starbucks they're gross don't order those and then I'm gonna return
[30277.26s -> 30281.10s]  that order and just get a fucking coffee we're gonna get up and we're
[30281.10s -> 30289.16s]  gonna go coming in fresh tomorrow and with that that's my time here but
[30289.76s -> 30294.84s]  thank you for those of you that have stuck through this playthrough I know
[30294.84s -> 30298.16s]  that a bunch of people probably don't want to see it they don't want to see
[30298.16s -> 30302.28s]  the end of the game or they don't want to see potentially somebody get the
[30302.28s -> 30305.76s]  rass kicked right so thank you for sticking through the whole thing I
[30305.76s -> 30314.35s]  look forward to seeing you tomorrow and the completion of the game take
[30314.35s -> 30319.90s]  care much love to you see you real soon
