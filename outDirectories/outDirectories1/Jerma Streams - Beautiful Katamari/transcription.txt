[1.78s -> 26.54s]  And I have to... This beautiful kafamari. Can you see it? No, you can't. But why? Oh, there we go.
[30.38s -> 60.22s]  I think it's working. Ears are be noticed. That's really loud, sorry. Hold on. Almost ready!
[63.58s -> 68.55s]  Make my audio delayed. Just watch the video.
[68.55s -> 84.57s]  My flash? No? You guys are gonna tell me it's in sync though. But I'm not gonna really tell.
[89.42s -> 90.30s]  It should be pretty close.
[95.80s -> 105.29s]  Be updated. All right, let's start.
[105.85s -> 138.54s]  I'm sorry, I just skipped. I do have the DLC for this game too. Why? Because I just did. Painfully
[138.54s -> 161.05s]  low on data. There we go. The ball flew open away into the depths of the great cosmos,
[161.05s -> 180.04s]  leaving a great hole in the sky. Oh dear. King made a black hole playing tennis. Consumed the
[180.04s -> 204.76s]  whole planet. All suffered the same fate. They all got sucked in. That's not good. Have I played this
[204.76s -> 214.65s]  one before? Maybe. I don't remember. I've just... I don't remember. I never played this game enough
[214.65s -> 226.70s]  to remember anything about it. Well, this is a pickle. Daikon, dill, and cabbage. Sorry.
[230.18s -> 239.43s]  Most of the stars in the cosmos are gone. This is where we come in. We always save the day.
[241.02s -> 255.06s]  Side by side, we'll save the cosmos. But you're the sidekick. Just so that's clear. Do you want to
[255.06s -> 267.21s]  cape bunny ears and wings? Anyhow, we want you to assist us with this one. By a stroke of luck,
[267.21s -> 281.21s]  Earth is still there. So go roll lots and lots of ginormous katamaris. We'll do the hard work
[281.21s -> 294.70s]  of turning them into stars. We'll take care of that pesky black hole too. Ready to turn out some
[294.70s -> 316.50s]  colossal katamaris? Okay, time to get going. The cosmos needs our help. Yeah, this is not the
[316.50s -> 323.58s]  remake. This is... This is like katamari three or four, isn't it? Maybe even five. What does this
[323.58s -> 332.81s]  sit in release? Three? Four? Four. Okay. Rolling practice. You know the basics. Yes, I actually do.
[333.37s -> 343.69s]  That's all right. We can teach you Wii moon brain. Roll! Katamari 101. Presenting the
[343.69s -> 348.89s]  astonishing katamari. Sleek! Roll it. Pick it up stuff. Grow bigger. Repeat. If you do well,
[348.89s -> 355.85s]  this katamari will become a moon. Profound, yes. We have that effect on everyone. Give it a spin
[355.85s -> 367.50s]  and pop it on top of that platform. You ready? Roll. Roll. Roll. Roll backwards. Roll sideways.
[369.86s -> 377.40s]  Roll up and over object. There we are. All right. Not hideous at all. Enjoy yourself.
[378.04s -> 383.00s]  And now there's a big mess of stuff all around. Such odd shapes they have downright disturbing.
[383.00s -> 387.72s]  Anywho, roll them up with the katamari, please. The katamari will start to get bigger and bigger.
[387.72s -> 401.45s]  It's all very strangely satisfying. Who knew? Yes, I remember. It feels so wonderful.
[402.57s -> 419.42s]  This is as satisfying as pulling up chest hairs with a tweezer. Did I just say that out loud?
[429.83s -> 436.23s]  Holy hornbeam! That box you rolled up is a present. From us to you with love. We know you need a
[436.23s -> 444.62s]  treat. Thanks for the present. Picking up the puzzles now. Now we can start taking over this.
[445.58s -> 456.14s]  What 10 centimeters you say? Getting bigger. Do a dash. Quick turn is the middle portion of
[456.14s -> 465.03s]  the buttons. This is you can go really, really, really fast. There we are. Look. I can move around
[465.03s -> 472.74s]  with the royal look. Let's see what you look like. Cool. And then there's looking from the prince's
[472.74s -> 488.20s]  perspective. Apparently out the door. Got it. I want to get all the pink puzzles. All useful and
[488.20s -> 499.77s]  necessary. So practice, practice, practice. Oh, nice and big. That'll make a nice moon.
[499.77s -> 504.89s]  And now the finishing touch. Roll up Marcy. What have you seen? That's weird or not.
[504.89s -> 511.83s]  Marcy is just hiding somewhere as usual. My money is on that big ball thing. Difficult word.
[512.79s -> 532.62s]  Once you roll up Marcy, you're done with practice. Let's get Marcy. Marcy. Did I get you?
[539.62s -> 545.72s]  Got you. You're done with practice. Marcy is rolled up. Remember how to roll now,
[545.72s -> 558.82s]  come and practice anytime. Back to the prince-dom now. Royal rainbow. These games are so fun.
[568.63s -> 574.46s]  Welcome home. So we got you to roll this moon for practice. Was it crazy hard? Not so much. Ah,
[574.46s -> 581.18s]  hubris. Hey, this Katamari is regular size. It's the wrong one too. Boo. We ordered a large.
[581.42s -> 590.23s]  Envelope, please. Points total time. Let's see. 63 points. Such an ordinary score. Was that
[590.23s -> 597.43s]  Kalasari? It's okay. Normal is back in vogue. It's the new black. Inside sources reveal.
[598.79s -> 608.54s]  Prince has a penchant for weird things. Back up, we see. A present. An ambiguous accessory for you
[608.54s -> 615.32s]  to make your own. We'll keep it safe in the cake in the prince-dom. There should be lots more
[616.60s -> 625.69s]  accoutrements, so enjoy. A dazzle of color Marcy and none other. Lost again. The Pantone party is
[625.69s -> 637.29s]  in the prince-dom. Yay for a star. Uhuru. That one piece sticking out the top is annoying me.
[638.25s -> 654.87s]  That was barely worth it. Here's an idea you can do better. Are you the chat? That's a chat saying.
[655.59s -> 680.04s]  Okay, so I can walk around. Are we good?
[683.40s -> 688.84s]  Alrighty, here we are. This is the prince-dom. Your not-so-secret base. Are you thrilled? Dizzy?
[688.92s -> 694.52s]  It's okay to throw up. We made it just for you, a custom tailored star. It's small and precious,
[694.52s -> 701.00s]  just like you are to us. We'll keep adding to it more places to play. When your cousins come over,
[701.00s -> 708.28s]  they can live here. We made you houses too, so go inside each one, yes? Explore and play our little
[708.28s -> 716.57s]  prince. The prince-dom is where wishes come true. This just in. The prince-dom is now bigger. Check
[716.57s -> 721.85s]  out the new places. There's a photo album, presents, and other things. We also added a totally
[721.85s -> 728.73s]  fab place for you to play. We gave it the best name, the big tripper. Takes you on a voyage of
[728.73s -> 736.65s]  light and sound. See? Now you can make new stars again. Twinkle twinkle. Extra extra. A new area
[736.65s -> 743.10s]  has opened up in the prince-dom. A place of icy beauty called Sub-Zero. Watch your step, it's very
[743.10s -> 750.14s]  slippery. You can make new Katamaris there, so roll away. Attention shoppers! There's a new area
[750.14s -> 756.70s]  in the prince-dom. It's called the Tropic Quasar. So pretty and warm, just stuffed with flowers.
[756.70s -> 762.06s]  There's fun new things to play with too. It's the prince-dom 2.0. Go have a launch party.
[763.34s -> 771.27s]  Excuse us. Seems to be more colonies. Oh, did you go shopping Xbox Live Marketplace, yes?
[771.91s -> 776.63s]  Fabulous! Now you can make new stars again. Go pop into a colony and get a star maker.
[777.43s -> 782.79s]  Remember the present you rolled up just now? Those gifts you find are all in the presents.
[783.43s -> 788.95s]  It's that house shaped like a yummy cake. We'll pop all the presents in there from now on.
[789.59s -> 815.59s]  But right now you should try on your new gift. Let me try it on. How do I try it on? Does it
[815.59s -> 829.94s]  have to be like on a certain run? It says I have it, maybe it's just on. Is it on me? I got scammed.
[833.10s -> 839.02s]  Oh. All right, Xbox Live Marketplace. I already bought everything you can buy,
[839.02s -> 845.02s]  except for all the stupid shitty things. All right, save and load. Let's save it.
[849.16s -> 853.24s]  No, I'm not going to buy the cousins. They're like a dollar fifty each and they don't do anything.
[853.24s -> 866.78s]  Sound and vibration. Actually, turn off vibration. I hate vibration.
[869.75s -> 882.57s]  Collection. Oh man. Well, that's a lot of data. And then here is a photo album.
[882.57s -> 898.39s]  I don't have any photos. Wait, is that the camera? No. Unable to edit photo data. No great new photo
[898.39s -> 909.19s]  data. This music is freaking me out. I don't have any photos though. How do I take a photo? Pick up.
[909.99s -> 922.47s]  Maybe I have to take pictures. I love the giraffes. Okay, let's go. That's multiplayer.
[924.23s -> 927.67s]  And then this is online battle. I don't, that don't exist no more. What's this?
[929.77s -> 939.16s]  This is Fancy and Schmancies. Create a space station within the budget. This is DLC.
[948.78s -> 960.04s]  Egg School. Learn the basic controls. No. Munchies Manor. Roll up food to make
[960.76s -> 968.44s]  Cetus. All right, so this is this is DLC. No. All right, so where's like the regular just game?
[969.24s -> 976.23s]  One of these little huts over here. Just go to the cosmos. Oh, okay.
[977.27s -> 986.84s]  Fly to the cosmos. Welcome to the cosmos is an existence delish. Here you can look at all the
[986.84s -> 993.88s]  stars you made. Use a left stick then a A button to look closer. You can look at all the leaderboards
[994.84s -> 997.16s]  The queen wrote us a note about it. So here we go.
[997.96s -> 1002.76s]  Hello, darling king. Hello, sweet Marcy. Here's a quick sketch of the leaderboards for you. I don't
[1002.76s -> 1010.04s]  want to see the leaderboards. For each star you make, Katamarius gets the data. But only if you
[1010.04s -> 1015.80s]  have an online connection. Data from all over the world comes to Katamarius. So who made the
[1015.80s -> 1021.64s]  loveliest star of them all? The leaderboards will tell you. Close look at each star shows its score too.
[1022.36s -> 1027.80s]  Simple. Sure. She sends us kisses. Great. Play around with it. It's the best way to learn. Sure.
[1027.80s -> 1035.35s]  Oh, and press the B button to go back to Princeton. Sure. Okay. Moon. Everyone's Katamari.
[1036.15s -> 1059.40s]  What is this? Everyone's Katamari. Okay. What's that? That's like a password hash. I got like
[1059.40s -> 1065.51s]  scared for a second. I was like, does that make my personal identifier? Um, I don't think I have to
[1065.51s -> 1074.46s]  be here. Oh, right here. Dangerous colony. Roll up dangerous objects. No, that's DLC.
[1078.14s -> 1087.83s]  Is this not DLC? Lovers loom. Roll up fabric to make Vega. DLC? I don't know. I'm just gonna
[1087.83s -> 1103.88s]  go on this one. This is also DLC. Um, how do I play just the regular game? Go to the first island.
[1104.84s -> 1114.26s]  Hubble horoscope? Does it matter? Well, I think it's meant to be played after, right? This is
[1114.26s -> 1132.78s]  DLC? What is this? Mechanical colony. That's DLC. Am I gonna ever find this? The green island? This
[1132.78s -> 1142.30s]  one here. It's all DLC. Delightful dribble next to egg skull is not DLC. Okay. All right, all right,
[1142.30s -> 1160.65s]  all right, all right, all right. Munchies manor. Here it is. Delightful dribble. Go. That's all
[1160.65s -> 1170.26s]  DLC, man. This is DLC. Oh, who cares? Welcome to the thrilling delightful dirigible. Roll a great
[1170.26s -> 1179.69s]  Katamari here and you get a satellite. We require lots of stuff that has to do with play, like toys
[1179.69s -> 1185.56s]  and dolls and games and balls. May as well make it a fun satellite. You have to go to Cosmos?
[1186.20s -> 1200.74s]  This is fucking DLC. He's doing it out of order. That's why I didn't want to do the DLC.
[1205.38s -> 1216.54s]  This is not DLC. This one isn't DLC. I'm just gonna do this one. All right, roll time. Candy store
[1216.54s -> 1224.70s]  full of sweets and toys and everything. Delish. Maybe we'll get a treat. Yeah, this is the first
[1224.70s -> 1231.35s]  level. Okay, this, yeah, yeah. Oh, the Katamari. If you roll up this big in this much time in
[1231.35s -> 1236.79s]  20 centimeters in three minutes, then it's a lolly good job. Roll up playfully. Today's challenge is
[1236.79s -> 1251.08s]  to make a playful satellite. We'll be back if you need us. Be good and play nice. Let's go. 20
[1251.08s -> 1263.03s]  centimeters. All right, get off the screen. One yen coin. Hmm, very encouraging. Yes.
[1263.99s -> 1287.13s]  I'm gonna try with the rats. I can pick up the crayons. Oh, I can't climb that yet. Oh, shit.
[1288.01s -> 1299.05s]  Come on, get me in this. I can't climb all the way in? Ooh, red crayon. Your inaugural crash
[1300.09s -> 1342.57s]  from E20. I have like one minute to do this. Shit. Pick it all up. 10 centimeters. All the way up.
[1342.57s -> 1355.21s]  Come on, there's gotta be something up here. All right, here we go. Into the fridge. All right,
[1355.21s -> 1368.20s]  just get off. Get off this and just start rolling on the ground. Under one minute remaining.
[1372.42s -> 1389.42s]  Get all the rats. Come on. Over to the toys. There we go. Hurry, hurry, hurry. I'm going.
[1393.42s -> 1410.73s]  I'm going. I only have like another one centimeter. Go. Oh, shit. I'm stuck. Oh, 18, 19. Come on.
[1411.37s -> 1428.78s]  No. No. I'm gonna lose. Go in there. Yes. Kind of fast. There's still time. Plump it up now.
[1429.50s -> 1434.54s]  This is like your first real achievement, yeah? The first time you met our size time request.
[1435.50s -> 1440.06s]  We are so proud. Maybe we'll bronze this one. You can return to the Princeton
[1441.35s -> 1445.11s]  by pressing start. From there, we'll make the Katamari into a slug.
[1445.91s -> 1450.31s]  You can also continue rolling to make even bigger Katamari. The choice is yours.
[1451.03s -> 1475.74s]  We're going back anyway. It's really soon here. Dang it, chat. What is this dang it, chat? Oh,
[1475.74s -> 1492.46s]  whatever. Hello again. Sputter Nick. Feeling orbital. Is the satellite a go? Did you get a
[1492.46s -> 1499.70s]  lot of play things like we asked? Space toys, you know. Got a Katamari to show us? Bring it out.
[1500.50s -> 1506.42s]  This is 20 centimeters and eight millimeters. Here's what's in there.
[1507.22s -> 1514.02s]  Playtime, snacks, and rich. The top ingredients are play things. Yes, looks like you managed to
[1514.02s -> 1521.19s]  get some stuff. So we asked you to roll a playful sort of stuff. Hello. There's no play in there.
[1521.19s -> 1528.10s]  All work. Playtime is number one and snacks is number two. Let me see with dull boy, doesn't it?
[1528.82s -> 1536.62s]  Were you even listening? Such a killjoy. Now for a bonus bean count. Well, let's see.
[1538.20s -> 1543.56s]  14 points. Is this on purpose? Like for a documentary? If you don't shape up,
[1543.56s -> 1550.47s]  we'll ask Prince for help instead. Is this for a documentary? What a dick.
[1552.38s -> 1573.51s]  Doesn't take up that much space. You're a party pooper. Learn to roll better. All right, that one's
[1573.51s -> 1580.02s]  done. What about over here? Nothing else over here?
[1586.33s -> 1603.64s]  The tea kettle? Oasis Cafe. All right, roll up drinks to make mercury. Welcome to Oasis Cafe,
[1603.64s -> 1609.58s]  a rest for the wicked. For you, more work. Help us make mercury. We need lots and lots of things to
[1609.66s -> 1614.62s]  drink. Like water, juice, tea, milk. Mercury should be plump and juicy.
[1615.82s -> 1627.53s]  Like peeled grapes. Mmm. What skin tastes weird. Off to Earth. See you later. Now connecting to
[1629.42s -> 1646.38s]  Seoul, Beijing. I didn't even see the last one. They did surgery on a grape. Time to roll. We're
[1646.38s -> 1651.90s]  in a candy store. Love mom and pop places. They're yummy and cheap. Are you going to eat that because
[1651.90s -> 1657.10s]  if you aren't? Oh yeah, right. The Katamari. If you're old to be this big, 50 centimeters
[1657.10s -> 1665.05s]  in five minutes. A little juice. Lots of drinks. Water, tea, juice. Don't drink too much. There's
[1665.05s -> 1676.22s]  no bathroom. All right, let's get every piece up here. Or at least 50, 60 percent of them.
[1677.10s -> 1696.06s]  It's a really good early game. Turn the music up. I don't know. Nobody even said that, but I assume
[1696.06s -> 1721.26s]  they did. All right, I need drinks. Okay, what about over here? That's a good start. Except
[1721.26s -> 1726.79s]  there's weird, there's like animals up here. What the hell is this thing? Frogs?
[1736.63s -> 1753.70s]  Present. Let's make our way down. It's a present. So what's in it? Do we know? I gotta get all those
[1753.70s -> 1768.60s]  drinks. 15 plus. All right, there we go. Can I get in there? That's a chunk.
[1778.63s -> 1786.79s]  I got like four minutes. You can relax. Bigger Katamari means you can leave the shop.
[1788.57s -> 1800.87s]  Does, but not yet. Not big enough to get that. Of course not. I need drinks. I gotta pick up
[1800.87s -> 1817.70s]  every pallet of drink. All right, let's get up. We asked you to bake. All right, King, can you like
[1817.70s -> 1827.59s]  fucking come through like the PlayStation 4 controller speaker? Not big enough. Loading eggs
[1827.59s -> 1840.34s]  give you. I need more drinks. Back in the store. Or at least over here. Does that really even matter?
[1841.46s -> 1858.92s]  I don't think it does. Water. Nope. All right, back in the store. Wait, there's like a grocery store
[1858.92s -> 1883.26s]  right here. Holy shit, that's a lot. Up on the shelf. Get it. I'm almost there. Am I on the grill?
[1884.30s -> 1897.75s]  Yeah, I'm rolling over the grill. Back outside. I'm gonna go back in here. No.
[1903.50s -> 1914.60s]  50. All right, all right. Back in the store. I want to get back in here. Can I get in there anymore?
[1914.60s -> 1930.81s]  I'm not sure I can even go in here. Ah, whatever. Not a strike. Reset the whole thing.
[1936.81s -> 1955.10s]  Eat the kid. You can't. I'm not big enough. All the candy apples. Check this out. Come on, I need those.
[1957.69s -> 1990.44s]  Yeah. 65. Your Katamari is as big as 6,000 squids. Let me do you a favor here. Turn the volume up.
[1990.44s -> 2001.19s]  You need that mercury. You managed to get lots of things to drink.
[2001.91s -> 2006.09s]  Mercury fluid. A quick silver planet. Got a Katamari to show us.
[2006.81s -> 2014.07s]  Oh, bring it out. This is the Katamari. A mere 65 centimeters. Snacks, drinks, food.
[2015.83s -> 2022.97s]  Top ingredients are snacks. Looks like you managed to get some stuff. Hardly any drinks.
[2023.77s -> 2033.32s]  I'm gonna do this on purpose. 10 minutes.
[2043.16s -> 2052.60s]  A trace of earnestness. Aha, master of puni hero. All packed and labeled for a trip to the
[2052.60s -> 2059.38s]  prince. Yay for a star. Uhuru. I think that's kind of cool, isn't it?
[2060.86s -> 2074.73s]  Your party pooper learned to roll better. Two for ten gold.
[2081.58s -> 2085.58s]  All right, where's that other, where's the weirdo? I know they're called cousins,
[2085.58s -> 2095.59s]  but I just, I'm going to reference some of the weirdos. That's bad. New place?
[2096.23s -> 2108.95s]  Okay, so that's on. Looks pretty cool.
[2112.79s -> 2120.55s]  Game is so loud. Sorry. All right, where's the next, what's progression?
[2120.55s -> 2127.67s]  Is it that? Oh, this is Cafe. It's this one. This is DLC.
[2139.77s -> 2160.76s]  Ain't nothing over here. Maybe the outside? Oops, noob.
[2164.15s -> 2180.49s]  Lady Luck Casino. There we go. This is DLC. I don't think it is. Doesn't it have a planet if it's DLC?
[2180.49s -> 2187.37s]  Roll a winning catamari and planet Venus arises. For that we need a lot of expensive stuff.
[2187.93s -> 2193.35s]  Metals, jewels, money. Are we right or are we not?
[2203.94s -> 2219.27s]  Yeah, the Saturn icon is DLC. Yeah, that's true. These games are just so relaxing.
[2223.11s -> 2231.43s]  Dead Rising 2 end game to this is like, there's one extreme to another. I'm just chilling right
[2231.43s -> 2241.51s]  now. It has a glam vibe. It's totally simpatico with us. Oh yes, the catamari. If you roll this
[2241.51s -> 2252.79s]  big 60 and 50. Let's go. Five minutes. Going straight for the cards, what do you think? Yeah.
[2252.79s -> 2291.40s]  Hmm, almost there. I felt that one in my chest.
[2313.98s -> 2319.34s]  Can I get the scraperies? Yeah.
[2319.34s -> 2323.34s]  Wait, ship. Yep, I can get them.
[2333.99s -> 2337.99s]  When you run to something and you go, can I get that, can I get that, can I get that,
[2337.99s -> 2341.99s]  the answer is yes. It takes a whole day and a day.
[2352.94s -> 2361.08s]  Wait, the game's allowed? Did he say something? There, I got you.
[2366.54s -> 2378.31s]  Is this guy talking? I can't hear him. He's kind of behind.
[2400.87s -> 2409.10s]  A bigger catamari means you go outside now. I don't think I want to do that yet. Maybe I have to.
[2411.82s -> 2416.71s]  Yeah, I'm gonna go outside.
[2422.76s -> 2429.45s]  Is this technically outside? No, this is just a weirder wind inside.
[2442.81s -> 2443.31s]  Shit.
[2457.61s -> 2461.05s]  Uh oh, I gotta make something happen really, really, really soon here.
[2463.26s -> 2468.90s]  Oh, crap.
[2472.02s -> 2484.84s]  This is so itchy. I can't pick up the bearded dragon.
[2496.02s -> 2497.86s]  One minute. I'm almost, actually, that's just...
[2503.83s -> 2504.63s]  Going back in the house.
[2504.63s -> 2520.65s]  Right here. Holy shit. Wow. Well, uh, I found a way to make that happen immediately.
[2530.30s -> 2534.22s]  Oh, go up the stairs quick. Go up the stairs. Look at that thing. I can't get it.
[2536.38s -> 2539.83s]  Oh, get upstairs. Look at all the stuff.
[2540.63s -> 2541.63s]  Yes!
[2542.63s -> 2553.80s]  And this shit just run in the direction and you'll get something. Oh, stuck.
[2555.08s -> 2572.28s]  Nice. Now you know why the game is so satisfying? Yeah, because you can go from
[2574.34s -> 2583.16s]  40 centimeters to like 100 in 12 seconds. Well, there's the expensive thing you wanted.
[2583.80s -> 2600.20s]  Gold bars, right? All right, this is from Venus. 90 centimeters. What do you got?
[2601.69s -> 2607.05s]  Games, rich, and snacks. Games. Yes, looks like you made it to get some stuff.
[2608.17s -> 2613.05s]  Hardly any expensive stuff. I just, that's like 50 million dollars worth of gold in there, man.
[2614.17s -> 2622.63s]  43 points. Stop pretending.
[2631.64s -> 2642.97s]  That's nothing to a king. Doesn't take up much space. First cheat code Venus. Cheat code.
[2651.37s -> 2668.94s]  All right. Sunrise Castle. I'm making a comet now. If you roll the right, the cosmos gets a comet.
[2669.58s -> 2676.86s]  But you need a lots of Japanese things. Ninja, sushi, sukiyaki, bullet trains, and kimonos.
[2677.66s -> 2682.94s]  They have a fancy for a classic kind of comet. Give us Katamari to write home about, please.
[2683.74s -> 2692.36s]  After the Rugrats. Yeah, there is a Rugrats vibe from that music.
[2698.26s -> 2713.58s]  Hold on. I need to hear it. Rugrats bop music. Rugrats. What are they called?
[2715.11s -> 2727.67s]  Rugrats weird music. Rugrats theme. No, no, no, no, no. It's, it's like, it's not just the theme.
[2727.67s -> 2736.92s]  The theme doesn't do it. No, that's not, that happens during episodes when they're walking
[2736.92s -> 2749.94s]  around. What you're referring to is that like happens way more often like this in the episodes.
[2750.58s -> 2763.21s]  Like Tommy will get up and start walking and it'll be like bop bop bop bop bop bop bop. Here we go.
[2764.79s -> 2777.26s]  And we need that chocolate.
[2780.15s -> 2790.94s]  I know I'm going slow, but sometimes you have to. I gotta get all the chocolates.
[2804.23s -> 2808.55s]  Got the tops and I can move back this way. Let's clear this whole rack. What do you say?
[2809.67s -> 2815.80s]  Am I already big enough to pick this up?
[2817.38s -> 2827.61s]  These things? Yep. I got a decent amount of time too.
[2839.02s -> 2844.41s]  Cookie dough. I can't feel like this is just gonna get to the grocery store.
[2845.29s -> 2851.98s]  He's like, I want that. I give me that too. I want that. I want all that. Let's get four cookie doughs.
[2852.70s -> 2857.37s]  We don't really, I think we need one cookie dough. No, we should get four.
[2861.72s -> 2867.86s]  Why? Because we're gonna, we'll make like, we'll make like 80 cookies.
[2868.58s -> 2875.91s]  I did the same shit when I ordered pizza. How many of you guys have ever ordered pizza before?
[2876.71s -> 2881.59s]  And you're sitting there going, all right, pizza. Anybody want pizza? No, I don't want one.
[2881.59s -> 2886.31s]  Do you want any pizza? You other person that's here? No. Okay, well I'm going to get two large
[2886.31s -> 2893.18s]  pizzas and eat like four or five slices and that's it. And then it goes in the fridge.
[2894.14s -> 2899.77s]  You can reheat pizza? Yeah, but it's never the same. I know some people love it, but
[2900.81s -> 2910.73s]  did I miss a present? Was I talking? Cold pizza? Yeah, but the grease like solidifies
[2911.61s -> 2918.74s]  and it turns into this weird blanket. I mean, I'm not saying I won't heat it up and eat it.
[2919.94s -> 2929.51s]  I also feel the same way about, for instance, like a steak and cheese sub.
[2930.47s -> 2936.07s]  It does not matter what the circumstances. I've tried a million times. There's no way.
[2936.07s -> 2939.43s]  And I think I brought this up like maybe a week or two ago. Someone brought up like eating and
[2939.43s -> 2945.91s]  eating one meal a day or whatever. If there's a steak and cheese in front of me, it's going to
[2945.91s -> 2953.94s]  be gone. I'm not going to have any leftovers. This thing could be like 16 inches long and it's,
[2953.94s -> 2958.90s]  I'm going to eat the whole thing. I never have a leftover when I have a
[2958.90s -> 2971.00s]  hero or like a grinder. Ever. It's never happened. Come on, get up there. Come on,
[2971.00s -> 2976.89s]  get the stuff on the top. Come on, look at how much stuff there is up here.
[2977.69s -> 2981.56s]  Come on, climb it. Don't look here as you go. I'm going outside.
[2981.56s -> 3000.47s]  Didn't you eat a grinder from your car a while back?
[3003.53s -> 3007.37s]  All right. You're making that sound like I opened up the hood and cooked it on the engine.
[3009.53s -> 3020.31s]  Technically, no. It was, I bought it and left it in the car and it was a turkey sandwich.
[3020.87s -> 3026.26s]  And I, it wasn't very good. I did not eat it.
[3029.54s -> 3036.50s]  Hey, don't do that. Disgusting. Yes, it was. That's why I didn't want to eat it.
[3046.14s -> 3060.25s]  You did it. You're a liar. You're fucking with my image, right?
[3064.33s -> 3088.60s]  It's been one minute. How big is it going to be? Back in the house. Is it going to be 100?
[3098.79s -> 3124.39s]  It's got to be 200. No, it does not. 200. Oh, this ain't happening. I'm going to do it again.
[3124.39s -> 3136.58s]  Nope. Wasted too much time inside. I messed around too much in the shop. Can someone please
[3136.58s -> 3142.18s]  explain this to us? Why do we always get our heart broken? What is with Kunihiro? Two little
[3142.18s -> 3147.78s]  self-esteem too much. We hear that common entitlement. Wait, we get it. It's a slacker
[3147.78s -> 3153.94s]  thing. What next? Video store clerk? Screenwriter? Whatever it is, we are not paying for it. Poor
[3153.94s -> 3162.28s]  Poro stuck with a loser. But if you make it big, we want the swag. This game is fucking crazy.
[3163.32s -> 3170.42s]  All right. Let's do it again. Yeah, I didn't, I spent too much time dicking around in the shop.
[3177.99s -> 3188.20s]  All right. Uh-huh. Two meters. I'm just going right down. Started me in a different spot.
[3189.00s -> 3208.34s]  Can't climb over that? I guess I can. Let's go. A wall up against a wall. Get them all. Can I pick
[3208.34s -> 3245.46s]  up those things? They're killing me right now. Milk bottles. Can't get a cookie dough. I still
[3245.46s -> 3259.19s]  can't. Go this way. I gotta get outside ASAP. Get to two meters. That's not gonna happen
[3259.19s -> 3281.29s]  unless I get the hell out of here. That was a good grab, but not enough. Let's get out there.
[3287.86s -> 3293.29s]  Wait. Not yet. I know. Stop dicking around the shop. I know. I know. But look at all this.
[3294.09s -> 3320.18s]  I don't even need to do that. I can't get the flowers. I can't get that. I can't get that either.
[3320.82s -> 3331.58s]  I can't get any of this shit. I gotta grow now.
[3346.70s -> 3352.22s]  There we go. Can I actually pick up these? Oh, this stuff takes so spread out.
[3352.70s -> 3361.14s]  Cars.
[3372.82s -> 3380.39s]  Move, pro. Please. Not stuck in a wall.
[3388.15s -> 3407.70s]  Get it. Go around the city. Yes. I know, but I want the cake. Ugh. Okay, city, city, city, city, city.
[3408.66s -> 3432.94s]  Two meters. I gotta, I got two, three minutes to do it. Faster, faster, faster, faster. I'm trying.
[3435.93s -> 3460.94s]  I don't wanna go in the water. Okay. Here we go. It's so slow. Move. Ah. I'm not gonna make it.
[3461.90s -> 3472.54s]  Guess I hit the people. I'm too small. I need to be a little bit, like, even for the kids.
[3473.18s -> 3485.88s]  All right, I'm at one meter. This is where, this is where it's steam rolls.
[3487.32s -> 3515.16s]  All right, big enough for people. Get it. 40 seconds. Come here. 1.5. What am I running into?
[3518.79s -> 3523.91s]  Consume. I'm not big enough. I'm gonna fail it again, I think. It's gonna be tough. No, it's not.
[3523.91s -> 3533.50s]  I can steam roll right now. Just go pick up everything. Get all these TVs. 1.8. No! People!
[3533.50s -> 3554.63s]  1.8, 1.8, 1.8, 1.8, 1.8, 1.8. All these kids. Oh. That was close. Off to Princeton.
[3563.58s -> 3568.62s]  I want Derma to be my sleep paralysis demon. You don't want any sleep paralysis demon.
[3570.10s -> 3585.19s]  It's scary. Do we get a little Japanese stuff? Two meters. Hey, Japan.
[3585.91s -> 3589.72s]  Ingredients are Japanese things. Yes, looks like you managed to get it.
[3590.68s -> 3619.02s]  What about our big Japanese wish list? I think he just is mean to you every time. That's bad.
[3622.15s -> 3641.19s]  Comet. All right, Japan unlocked two for 10G. That pasta sucks. I can't even read it.
[3645.59s -> 3653.40s]  Okay, where to? How about? Do I want to do presents? What about this train?
[3659.40s -> 3663.00s]  Hey, look at a new place.
[3665.56s -> 3671.32s]  Cloud nine forest. Roll up plants to make Jupiter. Let's see it.
[3679.32s -> 3688.07s]  This is your chance at a majestic Jupiter. King has never been more right in his life.
[3689.83s -> 3696.49s]  It's all Jupiter's bottoms. Yeah, what's going on here? I've seen like one.
[3697.29s -> 3717.50s]  This is unbelievable. Can you guys get one? Almost. No. No. Oh, it's not going to happen.
[3719.72s -> 3732.15s]  Some of you guys have usernames that are way too long that you're pushing them. I've seen some
[3732.15s -> 3746.74s]  sloppy Jupiters. I've not seen a complete true Jupiter though. Can't do it because of slow mode.
[3746.74s -> 3753.88s]  That means you have to work together harder. There we go. It pretty much happens. Yeah.
[3756.28s -> 3763.40s]  All right, we may be the glitziest star in the sky, but this is so yes. Five meters
[3764.44s -> 3771.86s]  in six minutes. This is a big one. I got to pay attention for this one.
[3771.86s -> 3790.25s]  Can I get cheating? Get them all. What are we? Candy corn? We are not speaking to you.
[3790.25s -> 3814.68s]  What? I don't even know what's happening. Why do you guys get so angry? Look out. Ayaya. Ayaya.
[3814.68s -> 3831.34s]  Why are we doing ayaya? Get that shit out of here. I'm just kidding. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
[3831.34s -> 3850.63s]  I'm kidding. It was a joke. You can say ayaya if you want. He was serious.
[3862.28s -> 3865.24s]  All right, I got to pay attention. I think it was six meters. I'm not even close.
[3865.88s -> 3873.67s]  The whole, like, rabbit seance.
[3891.18s -> 3896.82s]  All right, I gotta go. Six meters. That's not gonna happen.
[3902.71s -> 3917.29s]  All those crabs. Ooh, Ashley. You got the cat? I did.
[3923.11s -> 3925.11s]  Ooh.
[3934.31s -> 3937.91s]  I can't break the glass and get the angel hair pasta with a sprinkle of olive oil and salt?
[3938.87s -> 3955.82s]  That's right. That's what's in there. Who sung this? I don't know. I think it says it in the beginning.
[3955.82s -> 3967.11s]  Rewind. This person just destroyed me. I got roped over five times by that same person. All
[3967.11s -> 3981.13s]  right, three minutes. Get rid of all the radishes. Strawberry plant, actually. Cool.
[3984.94s -> 3990.50s]  My favorite Ed Sheeran song. That's not even how you say it. Okay.
[4001.13s -> 4010.47s]  Can I get the bikes? Not yet. Get all the fruit. I think it was inside of this person's restaurant.
[4016.26s -> 4035.66s]  Two meters. I just ruined somebody's party. Can I get the little frogs? Yep, I can get those now.
[4036.62s -> 4048.38s]  All right, I need to steamroll this now. Here we go.
[4058.47s -> 4067.26s]  Almost in one minute. Banger right. I got the... Is it a clown?
[4068.22s -> 4094.28s]  I can get to the roof. I'm going to the roof. Get up there!
[4107.40s -> 4123.27s]  No! I'm not big enough. I'm not big enough.
[4125.19s -> 4148.81s]  Yes, restarted. Oh, four. I need six. Well, can someone please explain this to us?
[4149.77s -> 4154.65s]  Why do we always get our heart broken? What's with this guy? Too much is titled slacker,
[4154.65s -> 4163.69s]  loser, idiot, stupid. Is this more or less stressful than Dead Rising?
[4164.25s -> 4180.50s]  They may as well just be the same game. You're right. I know. More clocks to worry about.
[4182.47s -> 4204.86s]  Crap? No. That kind of started me out in a weird spot here. Oh no, here's this song again.
[4213.53s -> 4234.92s]  One in chat if you hate this song. Two in chat if you love it. I gotta hurry up. Go!
[4239.67s -> 4276.84s]  All right, end. Oh, oh, shit. The bunnies. They keep forever to turn on.
[4300.41s -> 4322.97s]  He passed. I passed? What do you mean I passed? What's with those bricks?
[4328.98s -> 4344.97s]  All right, I gotta pay attention. Good, good, good, good. I got a cousin!
[4346.01s -> 4367.98s]  I gotta get out of here. Please, just get me out of here. Congratulations.
[4395.35s -> 4399.51s]  I'm trying to get the pitch right. I'm stuck in a fucking wall.
[4400.63s -> 4412.42s]  All right, I have... Oh, this is hard. All the shocks. All right, get all these in a row.
[4417.32s -> 4446.97s]  Better than last time. Let me in, let me in, let me in. Oh, come on, I'm mostly free!
[4447.85s -> 4471.64s]  Turn around. Up. No, no, no! Oh, I'm so... In the water. I'm so fucking angry right now.
[4471.64s -> 4495.62s]  We're gonna lose again. We're gonna lose again. How do I get to the fucking city center?
[4496.58s -> 4513.83s]  I lose. This again. There's not enough time. I feel like I need like extra time. What? It's like
[4513.83s -> 4567.83s]  too long. It's possible. Hold on. It's possible. Fucking giraffe. Stop. I don't care. I have to
[4567.83s -> 4620.66s]  get out of this world. Old face to itch. Oh, all right. Just go outside already. I'm not going to
[4620.66s -> 4672.70s]  sing it again. If there's anyone that's curious. Move out of my fucking way. Those trophies.
[4673.74s -> 4703.69s]  Watching you do this actually aggravates me. You literally go pick up the smallest stuff where you,
[4703.69s -> 4707.53s]  German, NA5. Watching you do this actually aggravates me. You literally go pick up the
[4707.53s -> 4711.21s]  smallest stuff to where you could be getting larger. Try harder, German, the Cosmos, Daddy,
[4711.21s -> 4728.17s]  plus Spanky. Good thing I read that whole thing. Stop distracting me! All right, I'm distracted.
[4728.17s -> 4739.91s]  That's not good. All right, it's already, you've already fucked it all up. Oh, you've fucked it
[4739.91s -> 4755.19s]  all up already. There's lots of gold back there. All right, out. Two centimeters. I need to get,
[4755.27s -> 4771.75s]  just not much more. I've got three minutes. Get out of there. All the stuff with the water.
[4785.19s -> 4789.54s]  I'm going up.
[4807.80s -> 4818.01s]  Yes, I know. All right, three minutes. Two minutes. Bye. All right, now I gotta go up here.
[4838.42s -> 4846.44s]  What do I keep hitting? The umbrellas? Fuck off. You're gonna make me mad. Watch out for the
[4846.44s -> 4854.31s]  umbrellas. I swear. I thought that was a breakdown for the song. I was about to start singing.
[4859.13s -> 4896.55s]  Go! Get up. Pog. Pog. Pog. Pog. Pog. Pog to the chat. Pog to the chat. Pog to the chat.
[4909.75s -> 4927.11s]  Down the road. Pick up everybody. Every car. Every truck. Ducks. Might as well. Q.
[4928.07s -> 4972.28s]  Oh yeah. Game's pretty sick. You guys are so mean. Let me do this. Daddy's gonna be mad at you.
[4973.16s -> 4988.41s]  I want to hear this song again. I can't. I'm not gonna do it. Plants, flowers, aquarium. That's
[4988.41s -> 5003.14s]  what you wanted. There are hardly any plants in here. It's all of them. But there is a present
[5003.14s -> 5017.64s]  accessory. A little flower. Never good enough daddy. All right, that's enough. That's enough.
[5018.20s -> 5064.33s]  Spaghetti, aglio e olio. It's the essence of Italy. In case anyone was wondering.
[5065.69s -> 5087.10s]  Oh, fuck. Oh, my chest. Okay, that hurt. Okay.
[5089.34s -> 5100.62s]  Were you here like an hour ago? Oh, fire. Looks like fireman.
[5115.48s -> 5121.53s]  Welcome to the red hot roller coaster. Out of this crystal will rise the new planet Mars.
[5122.33s -> 5129.93s]  You can guess what you need. Hot, hot, hot stuff. Heaters. Kotatsu. Campfires. Cork buns.
[5129.93s -> 5133.93s]  The red planet should be piping hot. Freshly baked. Be warm. Be generous. And roll a big
[5133.93s -> 5156.94s]  Katamari up. This thing's probably going to be like 10 meters. We've come to roll in this store.
[5156.94s -> 5163.18s]  Kind of hot. Yes. Ew. Someone remind us why exactly we're here. Oh, yes. Katamari. We need
[5164.14s -> 5167.98s]  a nice hot Katamari. For that, you need to roll up the piping hot stuff.
[5169.78s -> 5173.30s]  We'll time you until the Katamari is 10,000 degrees Celsius.
[5175.56s -> 5180.10s]  What? It's not about size. Cold things will lower your temperature.
[5190.26s -> 5200.97s]  All right. Sausage. Bowl of soup. This one is the Katamari song with dogs and cats. All right,
[5201.05s -> 5223.10s]  this is all hot. We'll get the sodas. Baby milk. Why is baby milk so hot? I mean, maybe warm. Oh,
[5223.90s -> 5236.63s]  shit. I think 10,000 degrees. Hot soup. Oh, slow down. Hot buns. Hot coffee.
[5240.09s -> 5250.84s]  Hot tea. I can't see what the hell I'm getting. Okay. Bags of hot. I don't even know what they are.
[5251.96s -> 5261.02s]  Salmon. Does it hold? There's like steak dinner and shit over there. Something warm. It's miso.
[5261.98s -> 5275.26s]  We asked you to go feed the star ponies. The king is hungry. Every day. Let's go outside.
[5281.27s -> 5296.65s]  What's with the screen? Is it a roast pig? No, that's cold. Of course, they put the pig right here
[5297.77s -> 5320.52s]  next to all the freezer shit. Pizzas, cheeses, pizzas. Watch out. Is it dervishes? Yep.
[5321.24s -> 5336.26s]  Pairns. Fire extinguisher. Don't touch. Let me get the pig now. Forget about the pig.
[5341.13s -> 5361.50s]  Those are sodas. Don't go in the water. What are you thinking? Don't go in the fucking water.
[5373.69s -> 5387.59s]  5,000. Halfway there. What that is. This shit is absolutely real fire coming out. All right,
[5387.59s -> 5406.73s]  present. Slow down. That's ice cream. Don't touch it. Is that snowmen? This
[5406.73s -> 5420.46s]  sheep in the background is fucking with my head. Pick up the flames. All right, 10,000.
[5427.21s -> 5436.39s]  Nobody can listen to that. All right, I'm gonna go across the water just for a second.
[5454.47s -> 5460.44s]  I'm gonna pick up. Shit, it's so hard to see what I'm picking up. I just dropped.
[5462.10s -> 5481.46s]  Dropping fucking viewers, man. Dropping viewers like crazy. Dude, turkeys and shit. Oh, look at
[5481.46s -> 5494.57s]  this. It's done. It's over. 9,000 degrees. 97, 98, 99. Viewers increasing. Oh, shit. Viewers
[5494.57s -> 5519.38s]  decreasing. I won. I won. Imagine a viewer count was that volatile. I mean, maybe if it was
[5519.94s -> 5536.89s]  ants or something. The amount of ants that tuned in. He sees this as ants. No, I'm talking about
[5536.89s -> 5543.88s]  like just ants. I don't know, man. I have to stop laughing at my fucking side.
[5545.88s -> 5552.97s]  You don't just roll, Mars. You broil and braise it.
[5553.69s -> 5582.46s]  It's big from far away. Let's see. Food, cooking drinks. Lollipop. Nice. And a new, is it just the
[5582.46s -> 5605.59s]  same person I am with clothes on? 57 is not a passing grade. That's enough. Anything under 60
[5606.79s -> 5615.59s]  is a failing grade. Unless they've changed schools in the last 20 years, which they may have.
[5619.14s -> 5636.81s]  Have they? I'm gonna save. Should I get the lollipop? No, I don't want to get on the fucking train.
[5637.21s -> 5650.70s]  Get out of here. Oh, it's just in my mouth. That's sort of strange.
[5660.17s -> 5682.86s]  Under 65 unless it's a purge. What? No way. Anything new down here? DLC. What is dentist in my mouth?
[5683.34s -> 5695.99s]  Oh, I miss someone. Maybe to the right.
[5705.61s -> 5709.13s]  Go, go, go, go. Yes, there is.
[5713.43s -> 5727.58s]  Seadome. This is to make Neptune. The Tide Palace. Roll with distinction and the cosmos gets a new
[5727.58s -> 5733.50s]  Neptune. What you need are things from the big blue sea. Yachts, boats, fishies, maelstroms.
[5734.14s -> 5738.78s]  Neptune should be briny and wild and free. Yes, make a big catamaran and surf with the tribe.
[5742.52s -> 5747.32s]  For classes in your discipline you need to have usually 80 or higher or in an equal of credits to
[5747.32s -> 5752.28s]  offset a grade under 70. You usually can do that for like eight credits. What have they done to
[5752.28s -> 5773.74s]  our schools? What have they done to us? I don't know. Whoever is in charge. What do they do? In
[5773.74s -> 5783.59s]  my college everybody would, there would be no grades. There'd be no attendance record and there'd
[5783.59s -> 5792.97s]  be no grading. Everybody gets a B. People just show up and there's zero students in class.
[5793.69s -> 5811.94s]  All right, how big is it after 25 meters? No, but once a week I would have like a weird like
[5811.94s -> 5820.82s]  minute to win a contest for grading. I'm just describing. There's like a TV show on ABC that
[5820.82s -> 5825.62s]  is that right now. It's AP Bio with Glenn Howard. Yeah, like that's like what I'm describing.
[5826.66s -> 5842.49s]  Oh my god. It's a TV show. The guy that, Dennis from Always Sunny. Do I have to explain this or
[5842.49s -> 5856.42s]  am I about to get livid that you guys don't know who that is? This thing's gonna be huge.
[5858.04s -> 5871.99s]  Watches TV. Oh megalal. Well you don't think you watch TV? That's interesting. Everybody
[5871.99s -> 5877.03s]  has said they do not watch TV. I can get you with a got you right now. Would you like to hear it?
[5880.50s -> 5891.27s]  Where do you consume the Olympics? You know, the Olympics.
[5895.99s -> 5901.88s]  That's the Star Wars theme, but it's it's almost exactly the same.
[5902.60s -> 5919.56s]  The Olympics theme is almost the exact same as that Star Wars song. See, I just had to think
[5919.56s -> 5933.35s]  about it for a second. It's just the same song for a long time. The Olympics app is free.
[5942.28s -> 5963.82s]  They have like a table subscription. Here's about sports. I don't know. We'll see. It's
[5963.82s -> 5974.92s]  gonna be interesting because the the younger crowd, with me included, I'm the one. We're
[5974.92s -> 5979.64s]  not watching as much sports I don't think as our older relatives are.
[5989.02s -> 6015.94s]  Am I making this up? No, I don't think I am. Having like sports attendance
[6016.98s -> 6024.23s]  like the last five years or something. I can't be making this up. There's no way this is wrong.
[6024.79s -> 6045.80s]  My sources, there's just some drunk guy at a bar one time. NFL viewership is rising. Okay, I've
[6045.80s -> 6059.90s]  been hit by every car that came down the road. Am I going to be clear about that? I'm just gonna
[6059.90s -> 6077.75s]  get some houses here. You only put one in the road. If you hit one more car, I'm gonna leave.
[6078.71s -> 6096.23s]  Does it count if I crush it? That's what happened. Oh, look at this.
[6098.71s -> 6115.98s]  Almost there. That last one was so much harder. The islands. Go to the circus.
[6117.10s -> 6141.88s]  Pick it up. No, this is where it gets crazy here. All the cars. Yep. Out of the way.
[6142.76s -> 6158.78s]  Something round. You got Marnie. Yes. Am I big enough for the boats? We'll find out.
[6164.94s -> 6170.30s]  Not quite the boats, but big ducks. These ducks are huge.
[6171.10s -> 6183.51s]  And yes, they're boats. I know. Oh, almost. One more and I can pick up all the buildings.
[6199.35s -> 6200.95s]  13. I don't want 13.
[6202.79s -> 6227.67s]  Biggest one yet. The RVs up there. You can't get up there. I can get some of the houses.
[6227.67s -> 6288.47s]  Not all of them. I go back around. Come on and get the dog. It's stuck and over. But wait,
[6288.47s -> 6293.10s]  there's more over there. Stop picking up small things. Don't pick up small things. Stop, stop,
[6293.10s -> 6314.34s]  stop, stop, stop. You want to know how I read that coffee pasta? Watching you do this is so
[6315.06s -> 6324.28s]  aggravating. You continue to pick up small items and it's not. What's the king doing?
[6326.90s -> 6348.65s]  Resignation? Put that silly ball down and come over here. Oh, I failed? What did I need? It was 25.
[6350.01s -> 6358.49s]  I thought it was, oh, I thought it was 20. That's why. I was picking up the small items.
[6359.45s -> 6379.88s]  It was 25? Oh, that's not good. Well, I thought it was 20. Shit. I would have taken that a lot more
[6379.88s -> 6387.30s]  seriously. Damn it. Eight minutes. All right. No fucking around. Let's go.
[6401.62s -> 6410.23s]  Anyone notice this? I really like when Jerma like starts to understand like he has to really try
[6410.23s -> 6415.83s]  and go get through to the game. I always think it's so like inspiring when he just like starts
[6415.83s -> 6426.73s]  to do so well because he knows he has to win. First comment. Me too. I love that when he really
[6426.73s -> 6430.33s]  needs to get to the end of that. I actually have beaten Dead Rising 2 a bunch of times
[6431.94s -> 6437.14s]  and I can't believe he didn't restart. He played through just one and done. That's pretty,
[6437.22s -> 6445.00s]  that's pretty remarkable, if I would say so. New thread. Anyone just fucking loves him?
[6448.52s -> 6463.59s]  Okay, that's a wide, I thought he was like, is that a urinal? What is he riding?
[6467.13s -> 6475.10s]  All right. Okay. Let's put the image of him pissing himself.
[6475.58s -> 6488.97s]  Fuck. Bad timing here. I'm just doing so poorly.
[6515.98s -> 6540.63s]  Hello? Over here. I can't pick him up. Now I gotta actually really pay attention.
[6544.52s -> 6546.68s]  Now that I can get pretty much all this stuff in one time.
[6547.40s -> 6552.09s]  Greasy. Not there yet.
[6559.06s -> 6571.11s]  Holy moly. What? What happened? I gotta turn?
[6571.99s -> 6591.45s]  Let's get all the people sitting over here and then I'm gonna go over the ledge.
[6592.73s -> 6605.59s]  What am I listening to? That's pretty big Katamari. I know, I just said Katamari. I know.
[6608.58s -> 6661.46s]  Stay here. No. Now I gotta really string it together. Every road. Every car.
[6665.61s -> 6673.10s]  Traffic right here. I gotta go one more up. Up one more. Up one more. Oh, maybe do it again.
[6674.73s -> 6692.68s]  25, right? All this shit over here. Yes.
[6694.60s -> 6707.91s]  We're turning around. We're going back the same way. Ready? Buses. Can I not get the buses?
[6708.79s -> 6709.98s]  No, not yet.
[6739.02s -> 6742.95s]  That's really possible, actually. It's very possible.
[6764.86s -> 6782.52s]  Freeze. Help. I don't have to leave here.
[6783.48s -> 6812.44s]  18. Come on. Give me the big ones. Give me the big red ones. I'm stuck. Fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.
[6813.24s -> 6818.33s]  Give me the whales. I got them all.
[6836.76s -> 6842.81s]  There's a lot of concentrated shit over here.
[6845.85s -> 6860.33s]  No, not choking. No choke this time. That's for another time.
[6860.49s -> 6899.80s]  Move steady. Oh, save. Jerma, you're huge. I don't know. Ocean. Plants. Yay.
[6911.32s -> 6919.03s]  I would love to see King of Cosmos and Smash Brothers. That'd be pretty great, actually.
[6920.23s -> 6939.72s]  He's too big. He's too big. Too big. That's the, that's the Ridley argument. Yay for a star.
[6944.47s -> 6982.06s]  Neptune. He's planet size. Something of a stage. There's a rainbow. Oh, it goes nowhere. What's the next level?
[6985.66s -> 6998.70s]  Egg school. I see one. I see two, actually. Interesting. Cool house. Maybe I have to go here.
[6999.42s -> 7047.56s]  Well, this one is just like the hot one is the cold one. Pluto. Honey, there are lots of cold, cold things like snow, ice, icebergs, fridges, and a cold Pluto for what we need to cool off. A wet washcloth planet, a dark room of a star. Anywho, slip, shy, can, can. Look at all those Xbox controllers. Oh, this place again.
[7048.82s -> 7075.06s]  Kunihiro. Remember this place. Yes, we have been here many times before. That's right. It's the money dimension. We understand that money can't buy everything, but it's nice to have a lot. Yes. So, anywho. One meter in three minutes. That seems hard.
[7080.33s -> 7096.49s]  One of the best controllers ever made. Picking it up right now. Can I get the ice creams that are on the...
[7097.37s -> 7104.79s]  What's going on? Hey, give me those. You dick. What?
[7114.54s -> 7121.02s]  Look at all these Xboxes. Oh, so this is where they keep all the ones at red rank.
[7122.70s -> 7128.07s]  I mean, that's an average household amount of Xboxes that you had to send back.
[7128.07s -> 7182.25s]  Alright. No, here's the sponsoring stage. I get to roll up cool things. The Xbox. That's really cool, huh? Can I get the Xboxes? Not yet.
[7182.25s -> 7194.31s]  I'm going to have to punch into this, because... I'm going to get to one meter. Here. Kunihiro.
[7204.50s -> 7240.92s]  Xbox, for death. Got an Xbox. I got multiple Xboxes. Did it! Lost. I got to get most of these.
[7242.04s -> 7266.10s]  Should I go back to the red ring room? It's too late. The Xbox 360. I mean, the hardware was dog shit.
[7267.62s -> 7284.76s]  But it was a good console. You must be freezing from rolling all the icy bits.
[7285.56s -> 7304.17s]  And I just got the Xboxes. It was cold? Weird. I wonder what I would actually say is the worst console
[7304.89s -> 7312.89s]  of the last three generations to count this one. You know, so like Xbox One, Xbox 360, Xbox.
[7313.85s -> 7330.15s]  It's probably the Wii U. Yeah. The Wii U was terrible. It's funny because
[7331.03s -> 7339.42s]  immediately after that, they have one of the best consoles they've ever made. The Switch is awesome.
[7346.55s -> 7360.47s]  Saturn. I don't even know the Ouya. The Ouya does not even count.
[7361.27s -> 7376.39s]  I don't. It doesn't. No, that's not. I think you only count as a console in a generation
[7376.39s -> 7385.50s]  if more than 200 people owned you. Because I could probably make a box that played like one shitty
[7385.50s -> 7403.69s]  game and it would probably have more people that owned it than the Ouya. I remember seeing them on
[7403.69s -> 7409.53s]  shelves and it was like dust was on top of them because none of them had been taken. You could
[7409.53s -> 7423.42s]  run your finger across the top of the 25 they had stacked. This is a stylish city. Lots of
[7423.42s -> 7429.78s]  pretty people here. Lots to see and do. This Katamari has a special rule. Go collect lots of
[7429.78s -> 7439.05s]  ring-shaped stuff. You have this much time to collect lots of rings. Bicycle wheels, car wheels.
[7443.94s -> 7451.22s]  Okay. How many do I need? It's not about size, but don't be tiny.
[7465.35s -> 7485.16s]  Are you mad at me? Pires, skateboards, before rings.
[7489.21s -> 7499.26s]  Power place. You guys like this one? Donut, score. Oh, it's Van Van.
[7500.38s -> 7515.26s]  We asked you to put the cozy on. Oh, that's a new character. I like that one. Get the bike.
[7515.90s -> 7530.50s]  Get people around. Cars. Yes.
[7543.26s -> 7556.25s]  I'm vibing with this one. How does that pick up all those people?
[7558.89s -> 7572.22s]  That counts. Dropping carts. What does that mean? Vibing. I see it all the time. At least day
[7572.22s -> 7593.08s]  of the day. Fun fact, this track is written by Avril Lavigne. What are these strange things and
[7593.08s -> 7630.04s]  why? You know what I want to do? Does the thing exist to keep your vocabulary up? You know those
[7630.04s -> 7639.51s]  things? Brain games. Brain age. Is there one where I can do vocabulary? I need to have my
[7639.67s -> 7652.47s]  vocabulary checked out. I'm talking about a little game I can play in bed. It has to be a game I can
[7652.47s -> 7668.34s]  play on my iPad or I refuse to download. No, no, no. Not a book. I don't want a story. I want a game
[7668.34s -> 7677.70s]  that I can play that gives me a word. For instance, let's say the word is fast and it has like five
[7677.70s -> 7681.70s]  other words that mean fast and you have to say which one is the right one and it tells you if
[7681.70s -> 7697.35s]  you're correct. Were it a crossword? No, no, a crossword is a thesaurus. A thesaurus game.
[7698.15s -> 7730.46s]  How do we gamify this? I need a thousand rings or I'm going to quit live streaming.
[7732.14s -> 7735.34s]  I'll go on camera and I'll say, ladies and gentlemen, this is the last one.
[7735.34s -> 7776.92s]  Thanks for everything. We're all the rings. We're just a bunch of like dead animals.
[7776.92s -> 7791.66s]  Like, no, no. Okay. I got to do this. These circles? These aren't rings.
[7797.16s -> 7807.54s]  Guys, guys, this is bad. How will anybody ever trust a single thing I say ever again?
[7808.50s -> 7832.50s]  I know his career is over. His career is over. His career is actually over.
[7834.10s -> 7845.67s]  What did I say? 800? Hold on. Hold on. What did I say? 800?
[7894.34s -> 7898.47s]  It's okay. Within five. If you're within five, that means you did it.
[7899.93s -> 7902.81s]  If you're within five miles per hour for the speed limit, you know, if you give the speed
[7902.81s -> 7923.48s]  limits 30 and you go like 31 or 28, 32, you're fine. You rounded up. Guys, I say that like,
[7924.12s -> 7930.20s]  I say that like five times a month. No, I don't. Not that much. I say that like three times a year.
[7930.20s -> 7942.17s]  I say that a lot. I believe in you from the beginning. Hey, it's been really good.
[7944.38s -> 7952.90s]  You've done that four times this stream. You know, you're right. I can't keep getting away
[7952.90s -> 7965.43s]  with that. How could I ever trust him again? I know. Seriously, you can't trust me anymore.
[7966.31s -> 7978.90s]  I'm definitely going to be the donut person. Make a montage of every time I've lied. I've actually
[7978.90s -> 7986.52s]  asked for that. That would take a long time though. Not because I lie all the time, but because
[7987.16s -> 7990.68s]  just think about the amount of time you need to go through and find every time that I lied
[7991.64s -> 7997.16s]  in at least the last five years. That's probably hundreds of times.
[8003.51s -> 8018.39s]  This is not possible. The video would be hours long. Oh, I would just, that video would be so
[8018.39s -> 8022.47s]  long that I would have to just play that video and mute my microphone and just sit there silently.
[8023.83s -> 8035.62s]  All right, I want to be the donut. Come here. All right, I'm going to be Ban Ban.
[8036.58s -> 8041.91s]  And I want to try the new clothes. With the camera on, yep. Just shaking my head.
[8043.91s -> 8059.70s]  Is the game audio too loud? I'm sorry. Yep, the horn and a backpack.
[8067.29s -> 8074.81s]  All right, we'll do, we'll do one more and we'll finish it up tomorrow.
[8075.61s -> 8086.14s]  See, we're on this trend the last couple streams of beating a game, getting halfway through another
[8086.14s -> 8090.14s]  one and you need to start at the next stream, beating that game, starting something else.
[8105.16s -> 8115.03s]  Always half a game behind, yeah. Is there a new one? I don't see anything new. Did I miss one?
[8116.15s -> 8122.17s]  When am I going to do NGU Idol? You're going to have to fight through a sea of people
[8123.13s -> 8126.09s]  who will do anything it takes to not see that on stream again.
[8127.05s -> 8133.10s]  So I don't have, I, what am I going to do about that? Roll up energy to make the sun.
[8133.10s -> 8155.06s]  Actually, this is a good one to stop on, I think. Dinaville. No, I can't do NGU anymore.
[8156.42s -> 8167.02s]  The game is cool. I love those little games like that. They're not stressful. They're just,
[8167.74s -> 8178.57s]  they're just there. Oh, also, I know that the feature sucks and it's a stupid shitty feature
[8178.57s -> 8186.33s]  right now, but I was thinking about just putting on a random TV show to watch with the Amazon
[8186.33s -> 8201.21s]  watch party when it comes out. Those of you that don't know, you can't talk and I just have to
[8201.21s -> 8211.67s]  type in chat. This thing, it has to be huge, by the way. That's enormous. I have 10 minutes to do
[8211.67s -> 8222.18s]  this. Why don't I do my own Amazon watch party where I go get royalty-free old movies and we
[8222.18s -> 8227.37s]  just watch one. Stuff that's just in public domain. That doesn't even matter.
[8235.00s -> 8243.10s]  Can you do that? Can I just watch like a shitty public domain movie from like the 30s?
[8250.78s -> 8254.14s]  That would either be a really funny fun stream or a terrible stream.
[8255.10s -> 8266.18s]  We both. Maybe we'll try it. What do you guys, all right, what do you guys,
[8269.30s -> 8275.30s]  the problem is, here's my problem. You gotta commit to that because if halfway, if like,
[8275.46s -> 8280.90s]  after like 20 minutes of that movie, I'm just like, I, this sucks. I don't want to do this anymore.
[8281.70s -> 8304.33s]  You can't, I can't leave. What am I gonna pause, cut the movie off after like 45 minutes? If it
[8304.33s -> 8318.97s]  sucks, just play Fortnite on your phone or something. Something about watching a kind of
[8318.97s -> 8326.66s]  current TV show though, it actually might be kind of fun to just sit in chat and just be one of you,
[8326.66s -> 8341.50s]  you know what I mean? Just experience it with you guys. We'll have to see. How does it work?
[8342.46s -> 8350.71s]  I don't think I even have access to it. It's like a beta right now, right?
[8359.77s -> 8372.15s]  Just recreate a public domain movie. That would take a lot of work. Can we do that right now? I
[8372.15s -> 8376.71s]  don't think I have access to it. Like a beta right now. I could probably request access to it.
[8378.15s -> 8382.66s]  But I would, I really wish I could at least talk over the movie.
[8385.82s -> 8392.47s]  I, okay, I understand that. I understand that that, oh, it's like a thing with copyright and
[8392.47s -> 8398.70s]  they don't want to have like the movie be shown or replicated again with it. What, what, how,
[8398.70s -> 8405.03s]  why does that matter? You guys ever watched a movie with your mother? My mother talks over every movie.
[8405.75s -> 8416.63s]  Why is that bad? What, I think people don't talk during movies? When you go to the movie
[8416.63s -> 8420.55s]  in the movie theater, there's somebody talking. They're like having a full-on conversation.
[8421.51s -> 8430.01s]  What's the difference? I mean, the face cam thing, maybe. All right. Okay. So because you're,
[8430.65s -> 8433.69s]  you're like not in the movie. You're not, you're not supposed to be part of the movie.
[8434.73s -> 8438.01s]  It's licensed out. It's the movie. You're not in it, but just talking.
[8439.37s -> 8456.87s]  You can't even talk over the movie. No, from my understanding, you cannot talk.
[8458.15s -> 8475.80s]  Like there's no microphone and you can't be on camera and ever whoever is viewing needs
[8475.80s -> 8486.97s]  to have Amazon Prime. Yeah, that's true. Broadcast the show to your channel or the movie. I mean,
[8486.97s -> 8490.17s]  that, that isn't that the quickest way for me to get like my channels suspended.
[8491.45s -> 8520.38s]  Now what do we need? Like 500 meters. Can I get houses yet? I get it. If they ban you,
[8520.38s -> 8536.66s]  just ban them back. Uh, that didn't work. All right. I only have like four more minutes to do this.
[8537.62s -> 8556.60s]  I'm not going up there yet. Let me get all this shit first. You're going to get banned
[8556.60s -> 8567.38s]  and then imagine that. Oh, why'd you get banned? Uh, well, I streamed the nutty professor
[8568.18s -> 8572.34s]  to my chat and we hung out and watched it and now I can't stream ever again.
[8578.90s -> 8594.44s]  That's too bad. It was fun though. All right, we're getting there straight ahead. Super fast
[8594.44s -> 8608.04s]  motion. Hit the plane. Copyrights only last 75 years. Yeah. Ain't Mickey Mouse going to be
[8608.04s -> 8619.10s]  up for a copyright soon. That's going to be really, really crazy. Imagine your local car
[8619.10s -> 8625.29s]  dealership having Mickey Mouse in the commercial and the guy that owns the dealership is doing
[8625.29s -> 8636.14s]  the voice. You're going to have to deal with that. Oh, come on down to Paul's, Paul's uh,
[8636.14s -> 8641.98s]  employee of all of land vehicles. Oh yes, it's me, Mickey Mouse. Come on down and just save
[8641.98s -> 8651.96s]  20% on the neck on your first purchase. That's going to be horrendous. Oh, welcome to Michael's
[8651.96s -> 8657.00s]  furniture store. Oh, it's me, Mickey Mouse. Thanks for joining us and I have you come in
[8657.00s -> 8676.38s]  by a sectional. You guys ready for that? I don't think you are. Oh jeez Rick. And some of them
[8676.38s -> 8681.29s]  aren't even going to give a shit. They're not even going to try. Mickey Mouse will be on screen
[8682.17s -> 8703.96s]  animated. That's right. With two purchases, you get the third one for free. Tell them Bob sent you.
[8706.42s -> 8731.08s]  All right. I need to, I need to get to 500 meters. I'm going to lose. It's going to be a
[8731.08s -> 8738.65s]  15 second pause. There might be. This is some cool shit though. Too bad we're never, too bad
[8738.65s -> 8755.85s]  we're not going to be able to see very much of it. It's still kind of possible. Maelstrom.
[8756.49s -> 8767.83s]  Not big enough for the maelstrom. What the fuck is going on in my chest?
[8773.19s -> 8813.27s]  Come on. I spent too much time talking about Mickey Mouse. 230, 220, 230. Halfway there.
[8814.97s -> 8838.42s]  I fucking lost. I swear. Didn't even make it halfway. Yeah. How the fuck did I do that?
[8839.06s -> 8846.44s]  This is Matthew from the other streaming platform team. We're reaching out to you for a rat pack.
[8847.16s -> 8855.45s]  We're reaching out to your rat pack. We're fans. I can't even read this. We're prepared to offer you
[8855.45s -> 8867.38s]  $5,000 a sleeve full of Oreos in a backpack. Free present. Am I not big enough to get this?
[8868.66s -> 8874.74s]  This is terrible. Bad RNG. What a bad place to start.
[8879.62s -> 8885.42s]  Backpack. Imagine changing platforms for a backpack.
[8886.14s -> 8908.84s]  I'll tell you, that thing better be made out of gold. Imagine selling backpacks.
[8910.12s -> 8926.90s]  What a bad idea. Did you guys buy a backpack? No, by the way, there's $79.99. Dude is right.
[8940.62s -> 8949.78s]  Sell a briefcase? Dude, you know what I would, you know what I should sell? Fucking not. Hey,
[8950.42s -> 8972.55s]  luggage. Everybody needs luggage. Yes, other cities. I know.
[8973.43s -> 8981.11s]  Let's go get the stuff that I didn't get over here. We're out. Which way is it? Straight left?
[8983.51s -> 9004.81s]  Like a lug? Yeah, like just like luggage. Luggage. Suitcase. Stuck. Where the hell am I going? I gotta
[9004.81s -> 9016.90s]  go this way. You don't get it. Just suitcase. You know what you can take on an airplane or on a bus?
[9042.39s -> 9058.01s]  Nice spot where I can probably do this.
[9067.43s -> 9083.58s]  Why is he not talking? I mean, I am. I'm just trying to focus. I think I have to get
[9083.58s -> 9086.46s]  500 beaters in seven and a half minutes. Six and a half minutes.
[9086.62s -> 9106.25s]  I'm still not big enough to get these. Mike is not muted.
[9129.56s -> 9142.68s]  Don't be cool. My girlfriend is watching. I got you. Does anybody know when, um, I think
[9144.04s -> 9149.86s]  as long as I go up this, I can't fake a voice crack. So I'm fucking cool, man. So I'm gonna tell you.
[9169.69s -> 9181.90s]  All right. 48, five minutes remain. Holy, holy, a present.
[9187.80s -> 9231.48s]  Okay. Better spot than I was the last time. Let's go get this city. Okay. Now where?
[9236.97s -> 9256.81s]  Really? I can't get any of those? What? 100. All right. Start picking up everything.
[9257.77s -> 9262.30s]  You listen carefully. You can hear him scream. Or you can hear the dust scream.
[9263.82s -> 9305.03s]  What was that? Am I big enough to start picking up islands? I'll be there in a second.
[9305.83s -> 9358.44s]  All right. Islands. To the mountain. Oh, this way. Dinosaurs. Here. 250. I'm fucking close.
[9359.88s -> 9373.61s]  Okay. What are you doing?
[9375.85s -> 9379.86s]  Maybe at 300. This will stop to. All right. Now the islands.
[9380.98s -> 9399.69s]  I can start picking up most things now. Just move. Flag. It's so hard to turn it. I can't even
[9399.69s -> 9433.83s]  control it. Oh, no. I don't want to be this way. Why would you move? I'm just moving. Get to a
[9433.83s -> 9445.56s]  thousand. Get the giant dragon. Dragon. No. If I don't get to a thousand, I will quit screaming.
[9446.60s -> 9492.01s]  Here's your new thousand. Career saved yet again. C-A-R-E-O-M-E-G-A-L-L. No, there's no O.
[9492.73s -> 9504.36s]  It's not career or. You want fries with that? Career. I'm kidding. I know how to spell career.
[9505.08s -> 9539.14s]  I'm not like from the fourth grade. Energy. Present. Pancakes. Sandwiches. Another cousin.
[9539.14s -> 9571.34s]  Another cousin. Peso. The sun. That's a new one, though, for a lot of people is,
[9571.34s -> 9584.14s]  are you pretending to be bad for a documentary? Cool. All right. I think it's a good time to call
[9584.14s -> 9594.84s]  it. Just under the seven hour mark. We will. I'll ride the train. We'll see you tomorrow.
[9596.49s -> 9602.74s]  I'll finish this tomorrow. We'll do the DLC levels and then, I don't know,
[9602.74s -> 9620.90s]  fucking mystery stream. We'll find out tomorrow. The Nutty Professor. We're not going to be watching
[9620.90s -> 9633.34s]  The Nutty Professor, unfortunately. Thanks for coming out, guys. See you tomorrow. Let us go
[9633.34s -> 9643.11s]  to bits and hopefully the sub credits thing is fixed. It was screwed up before. Remember the
[9643.11s -> 9647.14s]  credits from last time? They just didn't get pulled through. Maybe they fixed it. We'll find
[9647.14s -> 9688.55s]  out. Let's go over here. Might as well check it. It was worth a check. Dermavurb noun. Immortalized
[9688.55s -> 9700.36s]  in the bits and the insane gifted subs. Yeah, pretty much. But special thanks to Dark Soul.
[9700.36s -> 9708.18s]  Thanks to the 250, they say. I hope you're getting to the bottom of your doctor stuff and feel top
[9708.18s -> 9713.30s]  soon. You haven't even said your famous catchphrase. Have a Jerma 985 day in a while.
[9713.94s -> 9724.74s]  Get well soon. Yeah, I'm going to have, I'm going to know, I think, what's going on soon here. It's
[9724.74s -> 9732.38s]  been a real pain in the ass, but, you know, do what you got to do. We'll see. But thank you,
[9732.38s -> 9737.40s]  Dark Soul. Appreciate that. For real, though, thanks to the 250, Jerma, have you ever considered
[9737.40s -> 9742.20s]  to do a one-off stream of a Paradox game like Stellaris? I know they can be hard to fully
[9742.20s -> 9750.79s]  grasp, but I think they'd be some good RP and bit opportunities. Probably not. Games like that,
[9751.43s -> 9756.15s]  they sort of, they require, correct me if I'm wrong, don't they require a pretty large time
[9756.15s -> 9762.71s]  commitment before you can really get into the game and care about it? And you all know me when it
[9762.71s -> 9774.44s]  comes to reading. I get distracted and I lose interest really quickly with stuff like that.
[9776.20s -> 9790.90s]  Not just on stream, just in general, too. No books. I'm more of a run zombie over with car.
[9792.39s -> 9811.26s]  Kind of guy, you know? He's our illiterate streamer. That was a pretty good time rumor. Yeah.
[9812.78s -> 9819.13s]  But no, probably not. The last time I played, I mean, I don't, Mountain Blade is one of those
[9819.13s -> 9822.33s]  games that you have to kind of sit down and actually care about and play and learn and
[9822.33s -> 9828.36s]  there's a learning curve to it. And that kind of didn't turn out. That was all right. It was fun
[9829.00s -> 9840.73s]  for a while. It gets good $500 in. I'm sure it is. Just not really for me.
[9841.45s -> 9852.18s]  But thanks. Thank you, Doc, for the, whoa, almost just read one under the threshold. That's my bad.
[9852.82s -> 9860.71s]  If you don't know, we have, there's a threshold on the channel. Anything above 250 bits
[9862.12s -> 9874.89s]  is the ones that are read. And I fucked it up right there. I'm going to let this one slide,
[9874.89s -> 9885.61s]  though. This is from we ran or why ran. Thanks for the 249 bits. But hold on. I'm a dummy and
[9885.69s -> 9896.92s]  I used one bit to talk in sub mode chat. So that's okay. Whatever. That's like funny to me. So I'm
[9896.92s -> 9903.96s]  going to read this. Anyways, any plans of playing the MCC halo games or any other rhythm games?
[9904.92s -> 9916.55s]  I have Buster group. That's kind of waiting in the wings for some random day. But halo,
[9918.39s -> 9926.36s]  we're going to have to, we will enjoy the halo games together. I have never played a halo game.
[9927.08s -> 9933.30s]  I have only played halo to multiplayer, just sitting in a room with some friends.
[9934.10s -> 9938.26s]  I have never played halo ones campaign, never played halo to never played halo. I don't,
[9938.26s -> 9950.54s]  I've never played them. So I have the string of that series. Whenever I feel like doing it,
[9951.26s -> 9964.62s]  we'll see. I'm looking forward to it. Thank you. MGS fan for the $30 3000 bits. No message.
[9964.62s -> 9977.35s]  There's a lot of money. Thank you. MGS fan. Appreciate it. Hydra. Thanks for the 500 bits.
[9977.91s -> 9997.21s]  Please watch Joel's 3d movie maker movie. No link. You don't have a link here. How long is it?
[9997.93s -> 10021.27s]  It's 26 minutes long. There's a full episode of TV. We're going to set like a whole day to
[10021.27s -> 10028.87s]  watch this one. It's like 30 minutes. Well, there's your TV show. Maybe we'll watch that.
[10029.86s -> 10037.99s]  Not right now. I thought you many made like a little bar that I have to check. I wonder how
[10037.99s -> 10047.05s]  those are you that will anybody watch? Anybody watch his 3d movie maker streams? Did he have
[10047.05s -> 10061.37s]  fun playing in a 800 by 600 window in the middle of his desktop? It took him 60 hours to make it.
[10062.09s -> 10070.60s]  Yeah, my game takes time. Halfway through his files. Yeah, you have to mod it. Otherwise,
[10070.60s -> 10080.04s]  it's unbearable. I'm not even sure you can play it without the new tools. It's been a long time
[10080.04s -> 10085.37s]  since I've really gone in there and played with it. Talk about 3d movie maker.
[10088.41s -> 10105.45s]  Well, maybe we'll watch it one day. We'll have to watch it in chunks. It's legendary. Yeah,
[10105.45s -> 10112.60s]  rat movie two took like three weeks to make. And it was like nine minutes. There's like at least
[10112.60s -> 10117.00s]  two or three weeks to like it sit down and do it for a few hours didn't to get away from it. Sit
[10117.00s -> 10121.24s]  down for like three, four hours to long fucking time. That program is not meant to make stuff
[10121.24s -> 10133.98s]  like that. So I can imagine a 30 minute short movie. It had it had to have taken like months
[10134.78s -> 10144.44s]  of actually sitting down and like sitting working on it. But that's really cool.
[10146.10s -> 10151.14s]  I knew that they were I knew he was he was doing it. I know he was doing 3d movie maker at one
[10151.14s -> 10159.82s]  point. But I'm glad other people know that that exists and use it. Because it's a untapped gold
[10159.90s -> 10170.38s]  mine. It's good to see people playing with it. But that was from that was the
[10172.23s -> 10177.75s]  that was just a chat. That wasn't even a bit message. No, it was it was Hydra. Hydra 500
[10177.75s -> 10184.30s]  bits. Thank you Hydra 725. Dino pulse thanks for the 500 bits. Just the thought I'd ask what's
[10184.30s -> 10190.60s]  your experience been with Street Fighter accidentally putting 50 cents into the machine in the arcade
[10191.80s -> 10200.95s]  losing so badly that I've never played ever again. I don't I don't do fighting games.
[10203.66s -> 10211.16s]  You know when I just get really angry when a zombie grabs me in Dead Rising. That's the feeling
[10211.16s -> 10217.00s]  that I feel every time somebody gets a combo off on me. It's like God fucking damn it. No,
[10217.00s -> 10232.54s]  stupid. No games fucking not even that happens every match. Stupid fucking idiot fucking down
[10232.54s -> 10241.38s]  fucking idiot. Those games can be kind of fun. When you just have a few drinks and you just act
[10241.38s -> 10245.83s]  like a dickhead with some of your friends. But you always end up with the one friend that actually
[10245.83s -> 10254.39s]  knows how to do everything. And nobody wants to play against them. Because you gotta you gotta
[10254.39s -> 10260.58s]  room for four or five people. Four of you have no idea what you're doing. You've learned one move
[10260.58s -> 10266.66s]  and trying one small combo. And this this other this other dude can do like a 40 hit combo with
[10266.66s -> 10277.42s]  smoke. By the way I'm talking about me. That was me. Mortal Kombat 3. I decimated with smoke.
[10278.92s -> 10293.61s]  Cyborg smoke. That's the one. I love being the guy that knows the stuff. That's actually kind of fun
[10293.61s -> 10297.34s]  because you can tell everybody what to do. And then they look at their controller and they look
[10297.34s -> 10301.58s]  at their hands. And they slowly do the move you just told them to do. And they did it so wrong
[10302.14s -> 10307.74s]  that you're just mad in the chat. Because the streamer didn't go the way that you told them to.
[10307.74s -> 10310.94s]  And you just can't believe that they would miss the thing that they missed.
[10311.66s -> 10314.95s]  And then you do you watch as they crumble.
[10324.09s -> 10327.69s]  We struck a nerve. I'm sorry what were we talking about Street Fighter?
[10330.01s -> 10341.78s]  I respect those games but I can't play them. You played you played Divekick. Yeah but that's
[10342.42s -> 10352.66s]  it was just me and Star just dicking around. I respect them I can't play them. They're fun to
[10352.66s -> 10358.97s]  watch. VictionIshius thanks for the 300 bits. After this can you do a Simpsons hit and run
[10358.97s -> 10366.63s]  speed run? I would probably never play that game again. It's in the vault. I've closed the door.
[10368.31s -> 10375.61s]  I put Simpsons hit and run in the bank vault. I closed it spun the thing and then when it said
[10375.61s -> 10380.97s]  please create a password I just smushed my fucking hand all over the keypad. I don't even know what
[10380.97s -> 10396.62s]  the password is. Don't ever let me open that door. But thank you for the 300 bits. Hole of one zombie
[10396.62s -> 10400.94s]  thanks for the 500 bits. I think you mentioned some of your comedy influences before or perhaps
[10400.94s -> 10405.66s]  it was a voice actor. Did growing up in Boston shape that at all? From what I heard there was
[10405.66s -> 10411.02s]  a large stand-up comedy scene back in the day. Also what's up with Providence? Why if I ever
[10411.02s -> 10415.82s]  watch a film set in Boston is there a scene where some guy's brother coming down from Providence?
[10416.54s -> 10420.78s]  Like it's Mickey he's coming down from Providence. Maybe I'm just a lunatic thanks for the streams.
[10422.14s -> 10433.19s]  Because Providence is in Rhode Island and it's really close. It's just a state away. It's just
[10433.19s -> 10438.44s]  like another state for them to say you know you know when you go and watch a movie and they say
[10438.44s -> 10446.34s]  the name of your city it's for that's why. And you sit in the chair and you're like oh and you look
[10446.34s -> 10450.02s]  back up back to the people that are with you and you're like that's they said the name of the city
[10450.02s -> 10456.84s]  that we live in. Did you hear you guys heard that all of us heard that. Cool cool they said the name
[10456.84s -> 10470.63s]  of a town. I guys I do that now even with Vegas. Anytime I oh yeah yo uh give him a call yeah he's
[10470.63s -> 10483.03s]  down in Vegas. Oh I that's me that's where I live. I just watched the hangover movie and I'm
[10483.03s -> 10490.10s]  constantly going oh fuck I know what that is. Hold on where's that camera pin I yep yep I've been
[10490.10s -> 10499.00s]  there I've been there I stood there. Cool oh you guys see this I do it with my city yeah everybody
[10499.00s -> 10508.14s]  does. I don't know why I guess it's just cool to see it in like 35 millimeter film. It's all digital
[10508.14s -> 10525.34s]  now. German lied about 35 millimeter being films. It's still cool though. But um I'm not sure if
[10525.34s -> 10531.58s]  being around Boston is what shaped. I just watched a lot of cartoons and a lot of tv.
[10532.62s -> 10543.74s]  I was just a huge fan of just weird cartoons. I was a huge Jim Carrey fan. They're just animated
[10543.74s -> 10554.70s]  fun interesting people. But with the weird cartoons running stimpy pretty much anything on
[10554.70s -> 10566.46s]  Nickelodeon from 1992 to 1996. Thoughts on Jim Carrey in the Sonic movie? Um I don't I don't know
[10566.46s -> 10573.50s]  I've just seen like the trailer. He's getting older too. You know you see he's like he's something
[10573.50s -> 10582.71s]  he's like almost what he's 60. He's old. He's getting older. Yeah he's pretty old. Let's see
[10582.71s -> 10600.47s]  how old is Jim Carrey. Jim Carrey is he's 57. I mean he's still doing what he's still able to do
[10600.47s -> 10612.49s]  right. But yeah I just a lot of Saturday morning cartoon stuff. A lot of Nicktoon stuff. There are
[10612.49s -> 10618.44s]  others that I could definitely think of that have just shaped the way that I think things are funny
[10618.44s -> 10624.22s]  or interesting. There's probably I could probably go rifle off a bunch if I sat here and thought
[10624.22s -> 10639.16s]  about it. But yeah there you go. Thanks for the message. Thank you uh Lights Noton for the 250.
[10639.16s -> 10644.28s]  Hey Jerma love the Dead Rising streams. I really commend you on the all-in-one-go approach. Keep up
[10644.28s -> 10651.18s]  the great work. You're a treasure. Turn cam on. Turn the streams over. Turn cam on. Don't work.
[10651.74s -> 10656.70s]  Yeah I told you I get I get the the the Boy Scout badge that says I did it in one go.
[10657.88s -> 10662.12s]  You may have restarted. I didn't. I get that the stapler comes over and just
[10662.68s -> 10673.03s]  onto my chest. It says you did Dead Rising and Dead Rising 2 true endings in one go without
[10673.03s -> 10680.84s]  restarting the game. And it hurts a lot. And then I turned it and you're sitting there behind me.
[10680.84s -> 10684.12s]  You're about to get your badge but your badge is not that. I turned you and I just go
[10684.68s -> 10689.46s]  I stick my tongue out. Quick enough where the adults don't see me do it.
[10691.19s -> 10714.55s]  And I turn back. Oh yeah thank you. There's that Nicktoons influence. Dexter's lab. Yeah that was
[10714.55s -> 10721.59s]  the same kind of era. Early 2000s, late 90s. I know it's so easy to be like ooh 90s.
[10721.75s -> 10727.98s]  I'm a 90s kid. Oh 90s. But there were some really great great
[10728.78s -> 10742.22s]  cartoons and pieces of media and actors and comedians. It was awesome. So many incredible
[10742.22s -> 10752.55s]  shows and and were just airing during that period. I know everybody looks fondly down
[10752.55s -> 10756.55s]  on when they grew up when they were a kid and everything and I don't know some of you guys that
[10756.55s -> 10762.31s]  might be a decade younger than me right now in this chat probably have those same fond memories
[10762.95s -> 10771.08s]  of something. I'm trying to think of something that was like Minecraft. Think about that for
[10771.08s -> 10778.86s]  a second right. Imagine if you imagine if you were like 12, 13, 14 when Minecraft released.
[10782.12s -> 10787.72s]  Dad it's kind of a that's a huge thing. That was a really really cool thing. If you were younger
[10789.16s -> 10794.28s]  imagine 10 years go by and you look back on everything that's me talking about running
[10794.28s -> 10813.22s]  Stimpy. So everybody looks fondly back on the cool shit that they had. I was in my 20s in my
[10813.22s -> 10820.98s]  late 20s and I thought that Minecraft was one of that first alpha. I remember specifically saying
[10820.98s -> 10829.78s]  holy shit if I was a kid right now if I was 10, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 years old
[10833.16s -> 10838.52s]  that would have been with me. This multiplayer you can build your own communities and houses and go
[10838.52s -> 10844.23s]  on adventures with your friends. I cannot even possibly imagine what it was like for some of
[10844.23s -> 10854.71s]  you guys to be able to do that when it came out and you tried to cash in with grandpa.
[10855.27s -> 10866.12s]  I used to carry a copy of Minecraft on a USB stick so I could play it at school.
[10867.34s -> 10874.82s]  That's so ridiculous. But then you think about what's the what's the new thing? What's everybody
[10874.82s -> 10881.93s]  going to get into now? If you look back fondly on how awesome Minecraft was for the years that
[10881.93s -> 10890.18s]  you played it when you were a kid. What is that now? Is it Fortnite? Is it? I don't think it is.
[10890.18s -> 10905.19s]  You know why? Because Fortnite is a battle royale game. Fortnite is not Minecraft. It's really,
[10905.19s -> 10911.02s]  really popular. But if the Fortnite if Fortnite is the Minecraft for the kids right now
[10911.58s -> 10924.09s]  and is the Ren and Stimpy for me. I don't I'm not so sure I like that. It's just a BR is not
[10928.97s -> 10935.53s]  need to wait a few more years. I wonder what the next big thing will be. Once BRs are done and gone
[10935.53s -> 10942.86s]  it was mobis for a little while. What's it gonna be next? Maybe the next iteration of VR
[10943.58s -> 10952.15s]  might actually do it. Because imagine you picking up a VR headset that's like a Vive 3 or whatever
[10952.15s -> 10957.35s]  the hell it would be. And you put it on you're like holy shit this is insane. This is this is
[10957.35s -> 10962.15s]  way better than the original vibe. This is like genre defining. And there's like a 12 to 13 year
[10962.15s -> 10974.36s]  old that's putting it on for the first time. We'll see. Just wait for Minecraft 2. Didn't
[10974.36s -> 10980.33s]  it already come out? It's Minecraft in real life right? I actually was gonna download it. I couldn't
[10980.33s -> 10992.86s]  all of my devices aren't good enough. I tried. Yeah Minecraft Earth. My iPad's not good enough
[10992.86s -> 10998.14s]  and my iPhone. They're both not good enough to run the game. I can't even download it. It
[10998.14s -> 11013.37s]  won't let me. I was a little disappointed. Yeah I have an iPhone 6. I want. You ready for me to
[11013.37s -> 11018.41s]  explode right now? Have I ever talked about this? It's the end of the stream. Who cares?
[11019.13s -> 11029.62s]  Have I talked about the iPhone SE? You ever heard me go off on that before? I don't think so. No.
[11029.62s -> 11043.88s]  This is fresh. Why is the only phone that's not a gigantic brick not only discontinued
[11043.96s -> 11052.42s]  but they're never gonna make one ever again. That iPhone 4 case, the iPhone SE was this iPhone
[11052.42s -> 11060.41s]  special edition. It was small. It was that iPhone 4 chassis. Small enough to fit in your hand.
[11060.41s -> 11069.27s]  Easy to go in your pocket. And they deleted them. They discontinued the SE. Why? And apparently the
[11069.27s -> 11077.34s]  rumors that the SE 2 is gonna be as big as a regular iPhone. Nobody make, they're all huge.
[11077.34s -> 11085.08s]  Nobody makes a phone anymore that's a 4 to 6 inch screen. That iPhone 4 size, everyone's just
[11085.08s -> 11095.27s]  making huge ass phones. Nobody, nobody is making a fucking phone that is a, I'm gonna say it,
[11095.91s -> 11105.16s]  but you know, I'm gonna say it. Compact. It's compact phone. I don't want a huge phone. I want
[11105.16s -> 11111.19s]  a small phone that I can easily get in my pocket and get out and put, I don't like this big phones.
[11111.19s -> 11118.30s]  And the SE was perfect. I am not kidding. Kim can literally corroborate this story.
[11118.30s -> 11128.50s]  I was going to get an SE and they discontinued it two days before I went in to go buy one.
[11128.50s -> 11134.06s]  We actually went into the iPhone store. I was like, oh, let's get an SE. Oh, we don't have those
[11134.06s -> 11140.04s]  anymore. And it was because I was like, I got on stage once every fucking seven months and goes,
[11140.04s -> 11147.26s]  hey, we're putting out new phones now that are all 1500 bucks each. And we're deleting
[11147.26s -> 11159.30s]  the last generation. Why do they have to delete, what is this, Hearthstone? Why do I have to go
[11159.30s -> 11168.97s]  back like two generations and delete them? Well, that's not in our standard decks anymore. The
[11168.97s -> 11172.25s]  SE was so different that I don't know why they didn't keep them around and everybody loves them.
[11172.25s -> 11178.41s]  It's not like I'm some weirdo that's making a big stink about the SE. If you type in like SE,
[11178.49s -> 11187.38s]  new SE, please God new, you get threads. People fucking want it so bad, but no, please scan my
[11187.38s -> 11197.42s]  face with the fucking 17 inch screen on my phone. I want my camera to be as good as like a film
[11197.42s -> 11206.97s]  camera. I don't give a shit. I want to be able to take my phone out of my pocket and it's so huge
[11206.97s -> 11211.61s]  and heavy and it makes a loud noise and I drop it on my desk. So everybody has to hear it and look
[11211.61s -> 11227.40s]  over here and they see my cool case. If you could kill somebody with your phone, it's too big. Just
[11227.40s -> 11238.44s]  saying. I don't know why they don't make him anymore. And I looked up other companies too.
[11238.44s -> 11246.14s]  There's a, uh, there's the, the, the, the razor, right? The Motorola, Motorola razor,
[11246.14s -> 11250.84s]  but there's a new razor coming out. It's a, it folds. It's a foldable phone. Well, that's really
[11250.84s -> 11255.56s]  cool. What's his, what is, what, what did you say? What did you say about that? You said that it was,
[11255.56s -> 11272.82s]  it was more than 15, $1,600 for that phone. Oh, okay. The iPhone SE was like 300 bucks.
[11274.50s -> 11294.01s]  I don't want a like $1,700 phone, but it folds. Is that worth 1,500 bucks? Sooner or later,
[11294.01s -> 11296.81s]  they're going to, you're going to have to start financing your phone like a car.
[11300.17s -> 11305.53s]  Now I got, yeah, I got a great interest rate on my phone. How much was it? It was 8,100 bucks,
[11306.09s -> 11312.09s]  but I found financing it over 40 years. Yeah. I have a 12% annual interest rate on it. It's,
[11312.09s -> 11315.45s]  it's pretty good. Pretty good. It would have been 15. Good thing my credit's so good.
[11316.17s -> 11331.66s]  I just want a goddamn telephone that can text and can play Minecraft Earth. You could buy a
[11331.66s -> 11341.62s]  trash phone to say, but I don't want a trash phone. I don't want a trash phone. I want a small
[11342.34s -> 11349.91s]  screen that has like apps, like small, doesn't have a big process, a long battery. I don't want
[11349.91s -> 11357.98s]  to go into Walmart and buy the $39 like poo poo wireless, whatever the hell the things are,
[11360.54s -> 11367.10s]  like prepaid, like $30 phone that is made. It's like a toy. It's like a baby phone.
[11367.10s -> 11378.12s]  I know it sucks even worse. Rip the whole, rip the covers off this conversation.
[11379.06s -> 11387.45s]  Rip the covers off. You know that they still make the SE, but it's for prepaid phones. So if you
[11387.45s -> 11395.40s]  want a SE, you got to go to get one of these prepaid fucking poo poo wireless phones and you
[11395.40s -> 11403.80s]  can't unlock them. They don't, you can't use them on another carrier. Just give me the phone and
[11403.80s -> 11417.54s]  just unlock it. Stop doing my best buys filing for bankruptcy. Well, give me my phone and maybe
[11417.54s -> 11430.22s]  we'll see. But like I'm going to help them. And then it has to be off of the right carrier.
[11430.22s -> 11434.38s]  Well, that, if you, that would, if you unlock that one, well, hold on a second here. That one only
[11434.38s -> 11443.34s]  works on the, uh, the Verizon and AT&T networks. That's not going to work on T-Mobile. Why? Uh,
[11443.34s -> 11452.97s]  because this is the way that I don't know. I can't tell you either, sir. And then you got the people
[11452.97s -> 11461.35s]  that bought a bunch of SEs. They went to, I just wanted to, I just wanted an SE. They went to the
[11461.35s -> 11467.51s]  Apple store when they heard about the discontinuation and they bought 10 of them and they keep them in
[11467.51s -> 11476.63s]  the seal. And then they sell them for like 500, 600 bucks, 700 bucks. It's sealed. I just want the
[11476.63s -> 11486.06s]  SE. It should be one per customer in the store. But then they buy them all. I don't even, where
[11486.06s -> 11492.76s]  do they even get these? Okay. Welcome to the, welcome to Apple store. How can I help you, sir?
[11492.76s -> 11509.32s]  I'd like to buy 15 iPhone SEs. Sure. Right this way. The 200 bucks new on eBay. That's a lie.
[11510.04s -> 11515.42s]  Those, those have like tracking devices in them. The person opened it up and like put a bunch of
[11515.42s -> 11525.32s]  viruses on them and they closed it back up. You wouldn't complain if they were buying 15 of your
[11525.32s -> 11549.85s]  shirts. You don't need my shirt to make a phone call. And my shirts also aren't $300. My carrier
[11549.85s -> 11555.51s]  is glue. All right, let's get out of here. Just so you know, where the fuck is the SE2? If the SE2
[11555.51s -> 11566.26s]  comes out and it's not a compact phone, I will leave Apple. Oh, wait, I don't care. I don't give
[11566.26s -> 11575.21s]  a shit what phone I have. I know that's like a way to pull. I'm going to take that seriously.
[11575.77s -> 11584.33s]  Jeremy, your phone is a tracking device. Yeah, I know my phone is a tracking device, but it's not,
[11584.33s -> 11608.36s]  it doesn't have a direct bug to like Larry's apartment. The guy that put it on there. It's
[11608.36s -> 11611.40s]  constantly recording. How do you think voice activation works? I don't have any of that stuff
[11611.40s -> 11634.92s]  turned on. Siri off, tracking off. They don't know where I am. All right. I just,
[11635.88s -> 11643.70s]  I'm just thinking of somebody turning off Siri and then being like, all right,
[11643.70s -> 11664.98s]  now I can go to Pornhub. Siri's off. It's the greatest surveillance device that the police
[11664.98s -> 11678.97s]  state could have wished for. Not if you turn off Siri. Don't you have to actively go into
[11678.97s -> 11682.09s]  like Windows 10? I remember doing this when I first go Windows 10. Don't you have to go into
[11682.09s -> 11704.89s]  Windows 10's settings and just click like, like, please leave me the fuck alone. It's crazy
[11704.89s -> 11711.78s]  because as much as this is a joke, I don't like being in a room that has an Alexa in it.
[11711.78s -> 11717.18s]  It's almost like I want to talk in a different room. It's like, Hey man, what'd you do yesterday?
[11717.18s -> 11723.77s]  Well, you know what? Well, you have an Alexa. I mean, nothing I say is going to be bad.
[11724.33s -> 11727.56s]  You're like, can we go, like, can we go in the other room? Like I just come up here,
[11727.56s -> 11744.25s]  like when I whisper into your ear, you should choose your words more carefully.
[11744.25s -> 11749.37s]  That's the freaks me out. I don't like Alexa. I don't like Siri. I don't like the Google
[11749.37s -> 11761.29s]  Assistant. I don't like them. I don't want them. I don't want them. I'll tell you the convenience
[11761.29s -> 11772.81s]  factor for being like, Hey, Alexa. Yes. Order 10 more cases of ocean spray pineapple juice.
[11773.86s -> 11782.81s]  Okay. It'll be here tomorrow. Thank you. But I don't, I don't like them. They freak me out.
[11787.56s -> 11797.70s]  Stop, Jerma. You just ordered that. Why are you scared to talk around Alexa when you tell us so
[11797.70s -> 11802.66s]  much about, too much about your life on stream anyways? Yeah. But that's me choosing to tell you
[11803.48s -> 11808.36s]  if I shit my pants, like I did three days ago and I was in my bed and I was like,
[11808.36s -> 11825.98s]  I just shit my pants. I don't want Alexa to know that. I tell my Alexa everything you tell me.
[11831.08s -> 11838.78s]  Anybody playing telephone? Oh, I shit my pants yesterday. Hey, Alexa. Yes, Roger.
[11838.78s -> 11840.22s]  Jerma shit his pants yesterday.
[11844.38s -> 11860.65s]  What is it? I don't get it. All right, we gotta get through this. No, it's different. When I like,
[11860.65s -> 11865.69s]  when I'm in a conversation with somebody, here's the difference. I am broadcasting to you right
[11865.69s -> 11872.95s]  now. I'm choosing to broadcast to you. If I go to dinner with Kim, that I'm not broadcasting the
[11872.95s -> 11879.34s]  dinner to you guys. I'm not broadcasting the dinner to my mother. If I'm sitting at the dinner table
[11879.34s -> 11884.90s]  and we're having a dinner conversation, that's not me doing a live stream. That's me and Kim
[11884.90s -> 11896.36s]  eating dinner. I don't want Alexa to just fucking lean in and listen to me. But why not? I don't want
[11896.36s -> 11903.35s]  somebody just like listening to me. If somebody opened my front door while I was eating dinner
[11903.35s -> 11908.76s]  and just sat in a chair and just that's what they did. They just sat there. Hey, who the fuck are
[11908.76s -> 11917.74s]  you? My name is Alex. Oh, hi, Alex. Can I help you? No, I'm just listening to everything you say.
[11920.33s -> 11926.17s]  Okay. And like Kim comes home from work and we just start to, you know, I don't want to have Kim,
[11926.17s -> 11931.38s]  can we go another? This guy is sitting in the corner and he just has his hand put up cupped
[11931.38s -> 11949.24s]  around his ear leaning forward. That's freaking me out. Can we go upstairs and talk? He hates Joel's
[11949.24s -> 11955.85s]  movie. What? He's writing everything down. That's what I'm saying. I don't want anyone just to
[11955.85s -> 11960.81s]  listen to me. People have like private conversations. I don't want like some random
[11960.81s -> 11968.25s]  Alexa sitting there hounding me. And you can always tell because if you talk too loud around one of
[11968.25s -> 11972.73s]  those things or if you like you're in the middle... Okay, let's say I was talking to the doctor. I'm
[11972.73s -> 11978.39s]  on the phone with the doctor and we're going over some very sensitive information. Yeah, okay,
[11978.39s -> 11982.47s]  that sounds good. So we're going to come in next week. I'll come in next week. We'll do that other
[11982.47s -> 11985.99s]  test. Yeah, thanks for all the information. Thanks for all my medical records that we just talked
[11985.99s -> 11995.96s]  about over the phone. Next week, adding to your calendar. What the fuck did you just do? No, no,
[11995.96s -> 12004.02s]  what? Or, or... I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say? I wasn't talking to you. I'm
[12004.02s -> 12018.81s]  plugging it from the wall. I'm not having one. Joke's on you. We're all Alexa. All right, how
[12018.81s -> 12031.32s]  do we even get on Alexa? I don't know. I'm going to tell Google Home you're scared of them. Sooner
[12031.32s -> 12042.15s]  or later, there's gonna be a service in the dystopian future where it is a it is a phone
[12042.15s -> 12050.01s]  booth that is padded and you go in and it's called the monologue box and it's just a spot for you to
[12050.01s -> 12057.00s]  go in and talk without anybody fucking being able to hear you. You go in there and vent,
[12057.00s -> 12066.97s]  but then it comes out that the boxes were bugged and they were being sold to Facebook and that's
[12066.97s -> 12076.50s]  how you're getting your targeted ads. Monologue box. That's my bathroom. Thank you. Thank you.
[12076.50s -> 12084.79s]  Thank you. Thank you. You're right. Thank you. I go off on full like theatrical monologues in front
[12084.79s -> 12095.78s]  of my bathroom mirror or the shower. It sucks when you get caught doing that though. Well,
[12095.78s -> 12103.46s]  this happened recently. A week ago, I was I was on like a full-on just like just like theatrical
[12103.46s -> 12111.56s]  monologue just talking into the mirror in like a towel and I and Kim walked in the room and when
[12111.56s -> 12119.21s]  you have that scenario with you're just monologuing somebody comes in the room you have you you have
[12119.21s -> 12128.18s]  that one second panic ability where you either pretend you were talking to them pretend you were
[12128.18s -> 12138.04s]  singing a song or pretend that you are on the phone pick one and it better be quick. I didn't
[12138.12s -> 12144.82s]  have it. I just simply said you caught me just monologuing. Yeah, I got nothing and she's laughing
[12144.82s -> 12151.14s]  so that I was she says like that you're a weirdo or pretend it just didn't know you can't pretend
[12151.14s -> 12166.66s]  it didn't happen. I'm a talker though. I will tell you I am a monologuer. I even like go over like
[12166.66s -> 12174.82s]  just just scenarios into the mirror that aren't even real. I have to constantly be in communication.
[12174.82s -> 12179.30s]  Why do they got live live streaming so much? I just love just being in constant stream of
[12179.30s -> 12188.92s]  conscious communication even when it's with a fake person that's just me in the mirror.
[12188.92s -> 12194.86s]  Also fun tip if you if you want to get even weirder before you monologue into a mirror
[12194.86s -> 12199.29s]  lean forward put your fingernail up and make sure that your fingernails aren't touching
[12199.29s -> 12203.21s]  because if they're touching that's a two-way mirror and you're monologuing to somebody behind
[12203.21s -> 12225.13s]  there. Fun tip that's not true it is if you put your fingernail up to a mirror and your fingernails
[12225.13s -> 12236.79s]  are touching each other touching no space in between it is a two-way mirror. Why do I know
[12236.79s -> 12244.30s]  that? Because I don't know it wasn't like a book of fun facts. I don't know where I don't know.
[12244.30s -> 12252.15s]  I don't know it wasn't like a book I read. It was a book I read called avoiding the government.
[12252.15s -> 12267.22s]  It was from a reddit post probably. I don't know where do you do you guys remember every small
[12267.22s -> 12272.55s]  little random tidbit of information you've ever been told in your life? You just you just know
[12273.27s -> 12289.43s]  never monologue when there's a bird on your windowsill. That's a government surveillance drone.
[12289.43s -> 12294.57s]  Birds are government surveillance drones now? That actually wouldn't surprise me.
[12298.07s -> 12304.65s]  Birds are weird. Maybe they're just constantly just bugged out. It's just old technology that
[12304.65s -> 12321.69s]  we don't even know about. Birds are not real. Birds are dinosaurs. Speaking of dinosaurs I
[12321.69s -> 12333.26s]  can't wait to get my monitor lizard. I'm not getting a monitor they're huge they're too big.
[12335.10s -> 12341.69s]  I can't no I can't. Although I have been doing a lot of research and it does seem like
[12342.25s -> 12348.41s]  for a large lizard the the Argentine tegu is probably the best large lizard you could get
[12348.41s -> 12358.42s]  in regards to how social and and just chill they are. If you're in the market for a very large
[12358.42s -> 12367.72s]  lizard. What do you guys don't think what do you guys think I do when I lie in bed? I've watched
[12369.08s -> 12379.94s]  like probably 50 reptile related videos just I'm looking at snakes and shit but I don't
[12379.94s -> 12390.02s]  I don't want a snake. They're cool but I don't think I could do it. Clint's reptiles that's yeah
[12390.02s -> 12411.80s]  yep I've seen some Clint's reptiles videos. I'm cultured. I'm gonna do it one day one day soon.
[12414.54s -> 12422.39s]  I don't think I'm gonna get like a tegu. I'd probably get something small.
[12422.39s -> 12428.15s]  I would never I would want to make sure I was prepared for that. What if your reptile doesn't
[12428.15s -> 12434.70s]  vibe with Otto? Then they just they would be separated. They're not gonna be together.
[12435.42s -> 12447.35s]  Anyways we got a little bit more to go. Let's go. Thank you to where are we? Crispin3day thanks for
[12447.35s -> 12459.00s]  the 400 bits. Jerma lied about not streaming for two months. Thank you daddy. How do you still have
[12459.00s -> 12466.31s]  this username? This this feels like a username that would get automatically declined when you
[12466.31s -> 12479.69s]  make your warcraft character. How is this still here? Uh thanks for the 1500 bits. Dad they say
[12479.69s -> 12494.71s]  wubba lubba dub dub. Excellent excellent contribution. Daddy again thanks for the
[12494.71s -> 12501.90s]  thank you dad for the 1500 bits. 30 dollars total here. I really like the cough and puke mechanics.
[12501.90s -> 12517.16s]  Super epic that's talking about dead rising. We've got a video here. We have a video of ducks.
[12518.04s -> 12526.17s]  This is from anonymous. Thanks for the 500 bits anonymous. Hey it's the animal rescue guy here.
[12526.17s -> 12529.13s]  The duck you named and the duck italics named had some babies.
[12530.01s -> 12533.77s]  Here's a short 30 second video of it. Feel free to share it with chat if you want.
[12535.08s -> 12550.30s]  Oh yeah let's take a look. Baby ducks. Let's see. Uh they say also go back to
[12550.30s -> 12554.46s]  Resident Evil 2. It was top in your discord poll of games people want you to revisit.
[12555.18s -> 12564.36s]  What do the Claire storyline? Let me get this on screen. How am I going to get this on screen?
[12564.36s -> 12576.18s]  Well we're going to move to here because we're almost done. Oh that's how. Okay can I get this
[12576.18s -> 12591.19s]  on here? Let's go browser source. Nah fuck I have to do it in chrome. That's why I forgot.
[12593.27s -> 12612.50s]  I have to do it in chromegalelome. Actually no I don't. Uh what the fuck is going on?
[12619.34s -> 12630.36s]  Can you guys see this? I hate computers. You know I like toasted marshmallow jelly beans.
[12631.08s -> 12636.31s]  Why can't this be more like a toasted marshmallow jelly bean? You know what I mean?
[12636.31s -> 12662.66s]  Can just open please. Open. Is it this? Let me try this. Oh finally. It only took you like three
[12662.66s -> 12677.61s]  years. It only took you three years. There we go. All right let's watch a baby duck hatch. What are
[12677.61s -> 12686.12s]  you gonna say? Oh here we go. Oh my god that's what's happening right now. Oh there we go. It
[12686.12s -> 12707.61s]  just got its fold job. Yeah. There we go. Hi. I did it. He's trying to keep his head up.
[12708.33s -> 12717.13s]  The miracle of life. This is just like Jurassic Park. Did that fit you? Oh here we go. Oh my god
[12717.21s -> 12725.32s]  that's what's happening right now. Oh there we go. It just got its fold job. Wow. That was awesome.
[12726.33s -> 12734.73s]  Cool duck. Duck's name. The duck's name. What's the doctor's name from um
[12735.69s -> 12741.05s]  Jurassic Park? Doctor what? Doctor starts with an H. Come on give it to me. I need it. That's the name
[12741.05s -> 12747.32s]  of the duck. No not Dr. Schmikeson. It starts with an H. Uh the doctor from Jurassic Park. Dr. Ham.
[12747.32s -> 12757.70s]  What's it called? Not Dr. Henry. Dr. Hammond. There you go. That duck's name is Hammond. Hammond?
[12757.70s -> 12763.56s]  Little baby Hammond. Took you guys a long time to tell me that. You guys are usually quick.
[12765.62s -> 12777.22s]  Hammond's the old guy. Yep sounds good. All right good. Yeah little Hammond. That's good
[12777.22s -> 12790.79s]  shit though. Thanks for sharing that. Hey Kai. Thank you Kai for the 500 bits. A few months late
[12792.01s -> 12796.17s]  but still glad the birthday card brightened your birthday. It was incredible to see the pages
[12796.17s -> 12802.66s]  filled with art and messages from discord, reddit and chat in a week. It was insane. But I agree
[12802.66s -> 12806.90s]  with your thoughts on birthdays. Becomes a number in another day. Spent yesterday just hanging out
[12806.90s -> 12811.24s]  with friends and family but cheers to being 28. Hoping to continue drawing more stuff from this
[12811.24s -> 12822.46s]  community. That makes me ask what the heck am I doing? Take it easy. Much love. Hell yeah. Anybody
[12822.46s -> 12832.71s]  that contributed to that card. Thank you. It was overwhelming. And yeah yeah once you cross the
[12832.71s -> 12840.62s]  you can rent a car and you can be in a hotel room. They just sort of keep happening every year. That
[12840.62s -> 12850.68s]  doesn't mean you shouldn't celebrate it. At least in a nominal sense right? But thank you.
[12851.50s -> 12854.70s]  Man boy thanks for the thousand bits. Hey Jerma just wanted to share that after a pretty long
[12854.70s -> 12864.20s]  time of trying I finally found my first job in a theater. Theater? Like a movie theater or a
[12864.20s -> 12873.37s]  theater? Like a theater production. The pay isn't the best but everyone here is nice and I couldn't
[12873.37s -> 12878.12s]  ask for a better first job. It was pretty hard and my mental health wasn't the best for most of the
[12878.20s -> 12881.72s]  time but your streams always gave me a reason to be happy and laugh thank you.
[12882.36s -> 12895.86s]  That's awesome. He's on the screen right now. What do you mean? Oh there he is.
[12898.76s -> 12916.38s]  That's great though. First job. That's a pretty good first job to have. Nice work. Hope you make
[12916.38s -> 12926.09s]  some cash. And thanks for the 10 bucks. Take care of yourself. My first job was at a bowling alley.
[12926.17s -> 12944.30s]  That's a good first job. It sucked. Still though, it's still experience. Thank you Vilemi for the
[12944.30s -> 12948.94s]  2000 bits. Jerma I still don't see Jerma Psycho. I'm beginning to suspect you have lied to us about
[12948.94s -> 12957.24s]  it. I may have lied about it but it's gonna happen. I gotta find the right image. All right let's test
[12957.24s -> 12964.42s]  the credits. Do they work? Please? They do finally. It got reconfigured. Thanks to all the subs,
[12964.42s -> 12972.57s]  community subs, old subs, new subs, all of you. Thanks for being the oil and moves the stream
[12972.57s -> 12984.23s]  forward. Thanks guys. And thank you Vilemi for the 2000 bits. And again with for 300 here. I can't
[12984.23s -> 12988.47s]  believe Jerma is a weeb now. That was when I was singing the song. I wasn't singing the song. I was
[12988.47s -> 12995.85s]  just getting the pitch right. I don't even know how the song goes. He's grinding us into oil.
[13002.12s -> 13007.88s]  Hey Al Stora H2O thanks for the 250. Hey Jerma my birthday was last week but I finally have the
[13007.88s -> 13020.01s]  cash to send a message. Could I possibly get a QRS for the occasion? Yep. Yep. Oh I can't.
[13020.73s -> 13033.03s]  I can't do it. I have to be like shit faced. I got I gave you three Qs. I can only do that when I have
[13033.03s -> 13048.62s]  had like four glasses of wine. You got you got Q Q Q. Why do you back away from the mic so it doesn't
[13048.62s -> 13065.45s]  hurt your ears? If I went like yeah it would be so harsh. I only unintentionally hurt your ears.
[13065.53s -> 13075.66s]  Not intentionally. He backs away from the mic to breathe. Yep. But happy birthday Al Stora. Hope
[13075.66s -> 13080.95s]  you had a good one. Enjoy those Qs. Stinky Beaver thanks for the 250. Unfortunately I had to work
[13080.95s -> 13084.63s]  all night tonight and missed all of Dead Rising. I was feeling kind of bummed out until I saw you
[13084.63s -> 13091.29s]  alive. Thanks for making my night better. Yeah we finished Dead Rising. It was great. I got a little
[13091.29s -> 13094.49s]  angry at the end but that's how it happens in video games. You just sometimes you just get
[13094.49s -> 13097.93s]  frustrated and it's all good. That's what I tell myself in the mirror when I monologue tomorrow
[13097.93s -> 13110.46s]  morning. Thanks for sticking around. Avery dropped dead thanks to the 500 bits. Hi Jeremy
[13110.46s -> 13114.06s]  I just got off from work and I'm happy to see you playing Katamari again. It's one of my favorites.
[13115.22s -> 13119.86s]  It's very good. I don't know what to say in this message but I love you and your content spreading
[13119.86s -> 13124.66s]  good vibes and much love to you and everyone in chat. Also can you say hi to my discord server
[13124.66s -> 13144.87s]  who also watches you. They're called poop shitters. That better be real. Thank you. Thank you Keith
[13144.87s -> 13147.99s]  King Crimson for the 250. Really happy that you're playing more Katamari. It's my favorite game
[13147.99s -> 13153.11s]  series. Also if you do a public domain movie night you should set up a green screen face cam
[13153.67s -> 13156.71s]  and a movie see graphic so it looks like mystery science theater.
[13162.76s -> 13171.59s]  At the back of my head that would be so dumb. Or just I'm at the movie theater.
[13174.73s -> 13181.66s]  Make it a whole bit about it. Like throw shit at the screen. Get angry. Stand up. Like cause like
[13181.66s -> 13192.30s]  a problem. Yeah that sounds like fun. Maybe I'll do that. But thank you Keith. Hey hoops thanks for
[13192.30s -> 13198.02s]  the 500 bits. Have you considered playing bombastic the dice puzzle game. Keep up the fun content by
[13198.02s -> 13209.26s]  the way. Love watching you. I don't know what that is. Bombastic. I'm not sure. Mostly lost.
[13209.26s -> 13211.82s]  Thanks for testing the bits. I'm not going to read your message but thanks for the test.
[13212.54s -> 13220.42s]  Test works. Apple shift thanks for the 250. Hey have you had any wild dreams lately? I have wild
[13220.42s -> 13224.92s]  dreams all the time. I just don't remember them and I always tell myself I'm going to make a
[13224.92s -> 13229.40s]  dream journal where I get up and just turn over and write. But the one or two times I've tried
[13229.40s -> 13236.09s]  to do that I've woken up from a dream and then immediately want. All right do you guys do this
[13236.09s -> 13242.81s]  too? Some of you have to. Right when a dream is over you go holy shit that was fucking crazy.
[13243.37s -> 13248.41s]  That was so weird and interesting. I'm gonna go back to sleep and rewind and go over everything
[13248.41s -> 13263.62s]  that happened. And then you fall back asleep. And then you get up and forget everything. Yeah
[13263.86s -> 13270.28s]  okay. So I do every time I do that I don't turn over and write. I want to I want to re-watch it.
[13273.54s -> 13280.58s]  So my first thought is not to pick up like a notebook or a iPhone or something and write
[13280.58s -> 13289.70s]  something. I have some really weird dreams too. It's too bad. But yeah I do. Hey Zeg heart thanks
[13289.70s -> 13294.25s]  for the 250. I recently discovered that my 14 year old cat is seriously ill and I'll probably
[13294.25s -> 13298.54s]  have to say goodbye to him soon. I've been feeling completely heartbroken so thank you for cheering
[13298.54s -> 13309.80s]  me up a bit with your streams. Sorry to hear that. 14 is a nice long life though. Always remember
[13309.80s -> 13323.46s]  that. Hopefully you still have a good amount of time left. I'm really sorry to hear that. Thanks
[13323.46s -> 13338.12s]  for hanging out. Remember the time that you did have. More than a decade is such a long time.
[13338.68s -> 13351.00s]  The memories don't matter. Thank you for sharing. Thanks for the 250. Gnarly thanks for the 250.
[13352.01s -> 13356.97s]  As much as I'd love to watch you revisit Dead Rising 3 after playing the first two,
[13357.69s -> 13361.37s]  what if you went back to that Rome game you abandoned that was the sort of inspiration
[13361.37s -> 13368.22s]  for Dead Rising with the green blood enabled because my mommy won't let me watch without it?
[13371.19s -> 13379.91s]  Probably not. It's good to see the inspirations but sometimes the inevitable end product is just
[13379.91s -> 13387.67s]  way better than the prototype I guess beforehand. This is kind of one of those scenarios where
[13389.32s -> 13393.88s]  I play Dead Rising and Dead Rising 2. I wouldn't want to go super super backwards
[13393.88s -> 13403.40s]  to play their original game there. Interesting thought though. The shadows of Rome is by the
[13403.40s -> 13409.67s]  same people that made Dead Rising. I think it's by the same group of big directors or something.
[13411.70s -> 13419.82s]  Something like that. But yeah. Thank you Gia Norv for the 500 bits. German my first stream here.
[13421.19s -> 13426.31s]  What's up? Been watching your stream highlights on YouTube more so. Glad I subscribed. Seen a
[13426.31s -> 13435.98s]  couple people ask but if you haven't answered are you gonna play Code Vein? I wanted to. It just ended
[13435.98s -> 13442.25s]  up being one of those things that I got it, I bought it, and then it just ran out of gas before
[13442.25s -> 13452.25s]  I even left the parking lot. I want to get in that car but I have to walk gas from the gas station
[13452.25s -> 13460.04s]  to that car. There's just so much stuff, so many games, so many things I would want to stream.
[13461.69s -> 13467.61s]  But there's going to be a lull in stuff that I don't ever think that a game will never show
[13467.61s -> 13474.06s]  up on this stream because once we hit those times where two, three, four months go by and
[13474.06s -> 13487.18s]  there's nothing new to do, stuff like this would make an appearance. I play everything on this
[13487.18s -> 13496.50s]  stream. There's not very many things that I would not do. Maybe like a full game of Civilization,
[13497.22s -> 13504.09s]  something you would never see on this stream. Or strategy games. But even still, I don't think
[13504.09s -> 13516.62s]  that's even true though. Joel's movie is another one that comes to mind. Yeah. But welcome to your
[13516.62s -> 13526.38s]  first stream. I hope you liked it. Heroes of Might and Magic 3. I know, but that's a little
[13526.38s -> 13538.06s]  different. Heroes of Might and Magic 3 is like different than like FTL. It is. Or like Civilization.
[13543.94s -> 13561.82s]  Salty? He's fucking salty. What the fuck are you talking about? Fucking goddamn fucking thing. No,
[13561.82s -> 13568.02s]  I can't do that. Half of the people here right now may not have been here like eight hours ago.
[13568.74s -> 13573.67s]  I can't do like the stupid fucking dumb fucking dumb fucking stupid. I can't do that right now.
[13574.23s -> 13590.34s]  There's a huge amount of context to that. Not really though, but still. But thank you Geonov.
[13591.37s -> 13597.18s]  Geornov. Welcome to the stream. Hope you enjoyed it. Modest Narcissist, thanks for the 500 bits. Hey
[13597.18s -> 13601.26s]  Jerm, I'm trying to lose weight for my first attempt at cosplay in May for a convention.
[13601.82s -> 13605.19s]  I've already made some small progress, but I was wondering if you had any fitness or diet advice
[13605.19s -> 13614.54s]  that you could impart on to me? Thanks in advance and have a good night. First of all,
[13617.21s -> 13624.57s]  it's a great first step to try to lose a little bit of weight. Hopefully your cosplay in May
[13624.57s -> 13632.50s]  turns out great. In regards to losing weight, I unfortunately cannot give you much advice
[13632.50s -> 13639.08s]  because I've been the opposite. My whole life has been I need to try to gain as much as I can
[13639.64s -> 13646.68s]  and keep and maintain weight, not lose it. So I don't really have very much advice to give you
[13646.68s -> 13657.88s]  on the losing weight front. Do not eat tahini if you're trying to lose weight. Do not listen to
[13657.88s -> 13665.00s]  anybody in this chat. Tahini, if you weren't here, tahini paste is the most high dense caloric food
[13665.00s -> 13674.82s]  in the world. Do not eat that. But the real easy shit is just don't drink. It's just liquids take
[13674.82s -> 13680.70s]  up so many calories people don't even understand. Even shit like drinking orange juice, juices,
[13680.70s -> 13686.87s]  sodas. If you just cut out sugary drinks, somebody already said it, but I'm going to
[13686.87s -> 13695.27s]  parrot it because this is the way it is. If you start replacing all your high sugar drinks with
[13695.27s -> 13699.91s]  water or tea or even coffee, if you drink coffee, that's fine. Just don't put a bunch of junk in it.
[13701.75s -> 13706.54s]  You know, you can get a coffee from like a Dunkin Donuts or even a brew to the house.
[13707.26s -> 13713.29s]  You can put a sugar in there. You can put like a flavor pump in there, but just don't overdo it.
[13713.29s -> 13722.87s]  Don't go like six pumps. Cutting out soda and only drinking something like water.
[13726.22s -> 13733.82s]  There are, that is hundreds and hundreds of calories a day that you're not taking in. Diet
[13733.82s -> 13739.90s]  soda. No, I don't drink diet soda. Diet soda may not have sugar, but it still causes an insulin
[13739.90s -> 13745.02s]  response. It's just as bad as normal soda. I don't, I don't, I don't know the science on all that,
[13745.02s -> 13753.29s]  but I just know that diet soda is, you know, you're not really doing anything for yourself.
[13754.25s -> 13758.41s]  If you're drinking diet soda because you want to lose weight or because you want to drop calories,
[13759.86s -> 13770.98s]  you're still drinking soda though. You're not like solving that problem. Diet soda
[13770.98s -> 13778.23s]  fucks up your system. Yeah, but, but more so you're still drinking soda and it's so easy to
[13778.23s -> 13784.23s]  just go back to drinking a regular soda because you still drink soda. It's like snorting coke,
[13784.23s -> 13792.50s]  but it's healthy. Coffee's terrible for dieting because the caffeine messes with your dietary
[13792.50s -> 13804.52s]  instincts and appetite and it triggers insulin. Yeah, drink tea, but that's, it's rough to say
[13804.52s -> 13814.70s]  that to somebody though, because coffee is so, I love coffee. I love coffee. And if somebody told
[13814.70s -> 13821.11s]  me, dude, you can't drink coffee anymore, I'd be like, you can fuck off. I'd be like, nope,
[13824.78s -> 13835.32s]  but sometimes you have to do what you have to do. I just love coffee. And eventually here,
[13835.32s -> 13838.76s]  probably soon I'm going to have, I'm going to probably have to change my diet a lot
[13838.76s -> 13850.12s]  because I'm getting older. You can't just like pound coffees and fucking creamers. I don't drink
[13850.12s -> 13859.72s]  cream, but you know what I mean? It's like not good for you. If you drink a bunch of coffee,
[13859.72s -> 13864.36s]  it's just, I don't want to have like hypertension or something later on in life,
[13869.69s -> 13873.37s]  but unfortunately I can't give you that much besides general stuff like drink more water.
[13873.37s -> 13880.63s]  And that's so basic. You could find that on any blog post. I unfortunately can't help you with
[13880.63s -> 13884.95s]  weight loss. And I don't want to tell somebody, well, here's what you do to lose weight when I
[13884.95s -> 13892.38s]  have no idea. I can't do that, but I wish you luck. There's tons of great literature out there
[13893.10s -> 13905.85s]  for losing weight healthy. Good luck in your, for your convention cosplay. Hope it's a good one.
[13905.85s -> 13912.34s]  Thank you, modest narcissist. Reaper, thanks for the 250, Jerma. I have an old S E. Do you want
[13912.34s -> 13919.13s]  to buy it? Now you've bugged it. Nope. It doesn't matter. You could have that. I could have that
[13919.13s -> 13925.29s]  cleared by like a tech that it's not bugged. It's still bugged. You bugged it. Thanks for the offer
[13925.29s -> 13933.42s]  though. And then finally we have anonymous. Thanks for the 300 bits. Hey Jerma meant to mention that
[13933.42s -> 13938.22s]  those baby ducks will be combating an invasive bug species that's arrived on the East coast.
[13938.86s -> 13943.93s]  The duck you named will have thousands of offspring to help the environment.
[13944.81s -> 13948.49s]  Also, if you ever want to know a good reptile, ask me. I've owned everything and I have over
[13948.97s -> 13958.57s]  7,000 gallons in reptile enclosures alone. Holy shit. That's a pretty crazy couple of sentences.
[13961.16s -> 13969.11s]  Prepare the ducks for battle. Also, when's metal gear revengeance DLC?
[13991.10s -> 13994.06s]  Well, to be fair though, did I ever say I was going to play? Yeah, I probably did,
[13996.70s -> 14000.78s]  but I don't know. Like, Hey, I just finished the game. Will you play DLC? Maybe. Yeah, maybe.
[14001.50s -> 14014.89s]  No, you can be floaty and aloof with DLC in my opinion. He promises too many things.
[14019.38s -> 14025.86s]  You don't have to complete DLC because it's added content. You can be floaty with it. You can.
[14028.78s -> 14038.14s]  He just hates video games. I think I did say that like three times during the Dead Rising stream.
[14039.02s -> 14048.47s]  Oh well. Just like Dead Rising 2. What's the plan for tomorrow? We're going to finish Katamari
[14048.71s -> 14055.74s]  Beautiful. And then after that, Mystery stream. We'll see. Got a few things we can do.
[14061.75s -> 14068.71s]  And I'll see you tomorrow. Same time, same place. Take care guys. Thanks for watching as always.
[14068.71s -> 14075.27s]  Thanks for sticking around. For someone who makes a lot of wild references, he sure doesn't want to
[14075.27s -> 14083.56s]  make the classic guild he promised us. Yeah, but I opened up Warcraft and I got to like level seven
[14083.56s -> 14089.67s]  and I said, fuck this game. I'm not doing this again. I just didn't want to do it and it was
[14089.67s -> 14101.19s]  like a lot and it takes a lot of time. It takes a huge amount of time. It's a fun idea. I tried and
[14101.19s -> 14113.46s]  then I said no. So that was a lie. No, that was an attempt. I downloaded WoW Classic. I paid for a
[14113.46s -> 14120.02s]  subscription. I opened the game and I had the intention to make a guild and I got to level
[14120.02s -> 14125.86s]  seven and I said, I'm not doing this. I didn't lie. I gave up. There's a difference.
[14135.30s -> 14144.84s]  Bring back the polygraph. Polygraph stream two. Giving up is worse than lying.
[14150.92s -> 14156.44s]  Well, whatever. So what do you want me to do? You want me to force myself to play WoW Classic
[14157.08s -> 14163.85s]  to get to level 60? So I can open a guild bank and we can what? So we can just
[14164.57s -> 14173.75s]  put like 500 stacks of thorium in there? I'll get to 60 and I probably won't play the game anymore.
[14176.70s -> 14180.94s]  You know what would happen? I would have put a bunch of time in and got to level 60 in WoW.
[14180.94s -> 14185.26s]  All right, level 60. Let's go guild. And then I would have just fucking flaked and never
[14185.26s -> 14191.42s]  played the game anymore. I would have just quit. Is that worse than giving up at level seven?
[14192.82s -> 14203.46s]  I think so. You would have 5,000 people carry you through it on a golden carriage.
[14205.22s -> 14210.42s]  I don't want to do that. I don't want to do that. That sounds like so not fun.
[14211.14s -> 14220.94s]  What do I do? Watch people kill mobs and like hand me items? I don't want to do that.
[14221.66s -> 14227.38s]  I would just be like, all right, guys, I got to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to log off.
[14231.21s -> 14240.28s]  Just carry him around. I wouldn't even want to stream that. Oh, that would be so.
[14241.24s -> 14250.58s]  What would I even do? What would I even talk about? We could just fan you with giant leaves
[14252.18s -> 14258.87s]  and feed you grapes. The highest bit donator gets to be the one you slash follow.
[14259.83s -> 14278.68s]  That would be the dumbest stream ever. It wouldn't even work because if I,
[14281.62s -> 14287.14s]  if there was a quest I was doing and there was like 100 people, 200 people around me,
[14288.10s -> 14291.86s]  I would never complete a quest. All the mobs would be dead and people would just be like
[14291.86s -> 14302.73s]  trolling and killing mobs. I would never complete a quest. Please just do a carry me around stream.
[14304.12s -> 14309.16s]  Are there any other games where I could just be like carried around and just do nothing and
[14309.16s -> 14323.11s]  just get stuff? What other games exist that could do that? I just don't have to do anything.
[14328.22s -> 14331.66s]  The MMO streams. Yeah, they were a mess. They were fucking hilarious.
[14333.46s -> 14351.48s]  Rust. All right. Get in the Discord. Let's wrap our brains around this. If you can find me a game
[14352.36s -> 14361.74s]  where I can just be the sultan that just sits on a throne and just doesn't do anything and has the
[14361.74s -> 14384.39s]  game played for him and everything is given to me, everything, the title of that stream would
[14384.39s -> 14404.33s]  just be called the sultan. The title of the stream should just be called Lazy Fuck.
[14417.56s -> 14426.17s]  The Lazy Fuck. Does anyone really want to watch that stream? I know I'm sitting here laughing,
[14427.13s -> 14430.81s]  but I don't think very many people want to watch the Lazy Fuck stream.
[14431.69s -> 14443.14s]  And by the way, if I die, the stream ends. No bullshit. I will turn the stream off if I die.
[14443.14s -> 14463.29s]  If I have to even exert any fucking force. All right. Let's look into it. That sounds like fun.
[14464.33s -> 14472.70s]  We need a game where people could assassinate you. Okay. Somebody mentioned rust. If I buy
[14472.70s -> 14491.82s]  like a 500 person rust server, is that possible? No, this is so stupid. All right. Let me look into
[14492.30s -> 14507.29s]  this. Floats of my ideas in the discord. It could be Minecraft, Roblox. Yeah, I'm actually
[14507.29s -> 14513.37s]  going to look into it. Just do Dark Souls 3 with phantoms. No, I would want there to be at least
[14513.37s -> 14521.14s]  a hundred people on screen. All like just doing everything for me. I want people whose sole job
[14521.14s -> 14529.54s]  is to like chop wood and bring it to me. Even if they don't even need it. The Lazy, the fucking
[14529.54s -> 14544.76s]  Lazy Sultan stream. How many people can you have on Minecraft server? Can you have like
[14544.76s -> 14555.98s]  a thousand people on a Minecraft server? Okay. How much is a 1,000 slot Minecraft server?
[14566.78s -> 14590.49s]  It's like 300 bucks a month. It would be for one day. Oh my God. I need to
[14590.49s -> 14592.73s]  think about this a little more. This sounds really funny.
[14595.48s -> 14608.52s]  Multiple rounds. We could even do multiple games. Planet side too. No, I ain't doing that again.
[14609.40s -> 14614.12s]  If you die in the first 10 minutes, that would be such a waste.
[14615.69s -> 14621.13s]  And I'm not even saying bye. The second I die, the streams off. Like you killed me and like I'm dead
[14621.13s -> 14628.42s]  in real life. You guys need to work together to make sure that does not happen. The second that
[14628.42s -> 14646.30s]  my HP is zero. Oh, off. See you next time. He's going to jump in the lava for fuck's sake.
[14647.66s -> 14650.62s]  All right. I'll see you guys tomorrow. Sleep on this idea. It's fun.
[14651.58s -> 14658.15s]  Yeah, no bits or no just the stream will be offline if I go to zero.
[14660.17s -> 14665.27s]  See you guys tomorrow. Have a nice sleep. Good night.
