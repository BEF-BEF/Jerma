[24.82s -> 38.01s]  Why, hello there. How's it going? What's up? He's speaking. I, it's always a minute and 30
[38.01s -> 44.65s]  seconds after I turn the stream on. Have you noticed that? It is 90 seconds when I talk.
[49.58s -> 60.42s]  Usually, what about Golem part two? No, we're not going to play Golem today. I don't think we're
[60.42s -> 68.09s]  going to play Golem again. Uh, I gave it a fair score of, what did I give it? I thought it was
[68.09s -> 74.55s]  pretty good. I gave it like a 7.6. I thought it was fine. I like the, um, the ending cut scene
[74.55s -> 79.19s]  was really cool when you shoot the lightning out of your hands at Sauron. That was a good touch.
[79.19s -> 87.29s]  I think a 7.6 or something. I, although I don't, I'm not like a big fan of the, uh, over the
[87.29s -> 91.69s]  shoulder kind of 3d sonic levels type shit they were doing when you run really fast up and down
[91.69s -> 95.53s]  the hills and you go over the loop to loops and stuff. It was kind of weird that they put it in
[95.53s -> 98.97s]  the last. The last section was probably my most favorite, but also the kind of weirdest.
[102.33s -> 111.40s]  Um, I think it was a 7.6. Hey, what's up? All right. Today we're just going to hang out.
[112.04s -> 119.11s]  I like the crafting. The crafting system was good. Yeah. I'm going to stream for like only a few
[119.11s -> 124.38s]  hours today. I woke up with a fucking headache and it's just one of those headaches. It just
[124.38s -> 132.20s]  doesn't go away. So kind of annoying. When are you going to play SpongeBob Battle for Bikini Bottom?
[134.17s -> 151.86s]  He's lying. That was a lie. It was not. He's lying. Only a few hours. I mean, I, I typically
[151.86s -> 158.12s]  stream for like five to seven, but yeah, we'll just, we'll hang out for a little while.
[158.84s -> 168.58s]  I want to play this game called, uh, it's called Q Remastered. Seeing some people play this seems
[168.58s -> 175.90s]  like a good, uh, fun puzzle experience. It's a, it is a physics based puzzle game. So what you have
[175.90s -> 183.02s]  to do is you have, there's a ball you have to get into a hole and you have to use your imagination
[183.90s -> 187.82s]  to get it there. They don't give you any of the tools besides your imagination.
[189.58s -> 200.36s]  So I'm just going to hang out and play. Will you stream for 16 hours? That's never going to happen.
[203.80s -> 210.68s]  I don't, I don't think I could ever do a real 24 hour stream or more than like 15.
[211.48s -> 221.27s]  I don't think it's possible. My energy levels burn out completely after I want to, I mean,
[221.27s -> 226.39s]  maybe like six hours of being on stream. I'm kind of like, I, I, I have to leave within an hour or
[226.39s -> 237.61s]  two. Usually eight hours is like the end. I don't know how, I don't know what superpowers some
[237.61s -> 243.13s]  people have where they can just be completely normal and fine on stream for like 20 plus hours.
[243.85s -> 252.55s]  I just can't do it. It sucks to be old. Is that what it is you think? Am I just, am I just old?
[253.35s -> 267.37s]  When are you going to play tears of the kingdom? I don't know. I don't know. I have to be really
[267.37s -> 272.42s]  honest with you. Should I be really upfront? I don't know if I'm ever going to play tears of
[272.42s -> 282.58s]  the kingdom. I just don't know. Right. I don't, I can't say the answer is yes. I know everyone's
[282.58s -> 290.18s]  very upset now and everyone's very unhappy with me, but I just, maybe eventually there's other
[290.18s -> 297.83s]  things I want to do first. And in the priority list, it sounds really stupid and I, I get it,
[298.79s -> 306.01s]  but Gollum was higher on the priority list than tears of the kingdom. That sounds crazy.
[306.65s -> 313.34s]  But do you, do you understand the priorities that I have here? You know what I'm saying? Like Gollum
[313.34s -> 320.10s]  was higher on the priority list, not because Gollum is a better game. Where is the priority
[320.10s -> 327.96s]  for project Zomboid? Uh, okay. It's underneath street fighter six. It's okay. Street fighter
[327.96s -> 335.75s]  six is essentially, okay. I like that. I think I'm going to stream that again. Yeah. It's comedy
[335.75s -> 344.74s]  priorities. Exactly. Where is sorcery on the list? Where's Hilux two on the list? Where's Yakuza zero
[344.74s -> 354.71s]  on the list? Bucko. Ooh, that was a bucko on that one. Yeah. What's that? We can keep talking. Let's
[354.71s -> 365.77s]  get going. He's pandering. No, I'm pandering. Don't you think pandering would be a month of
[365.77s -> 371.93s]  tears of the kingdom only for you guys. And I'm going to dress his link every day. And I'm also
[371.93s -> 384.25s]  going to go, yeah, skip, skip. Okay. That just sounded like I didn't go all in on it. You can't
[384.25s -> 391.38s]  do that voice unless you go all in and I didn't fucking go all in. That was, that's, I fucking was
[391.86s -> 399.06s]  telling myself go all in or it's going to be embarrassing. And I didn't, you have to go all
[399.06s -> 404.02s]  in because then nobody can make fun of you. Cause it's like, Whoa, you went all in for that. Nice
[404.02s -> 412.02s]  actual effort there. Going scuts, scascute is not what he does. And it's not enough effort.
[412.58s -> 420.89s]  I need to do more. I try harder. But what if your voice cracks during that? Well, that's a risk you
[420.89s -> 433.10s]  have to take anyways. Welcome back. I'm going to play this fun game. See how it goes. But yeah,
[433.10s -> 438.54s]  I pandering would be if I were to be, Hey, I'm going to stream tears of the kingdom until I beat
[438.54s -> 445.10s]  it. And Hey guys, how about an encore? And I play the whole game again for like another month.
[445.90s -> 461.51s]  No, I'm not pandering. If anything, I'm probably I'm anti pandering. See who are you calling out
[461.51s -> 465.91s]  here? I'm not calling out anybody. I haven't seen one second of tears of the kingdom footage.
[466.63s -> 471.66s]  Zero. Well, that's not, that's not accurate. I've seen people, I've seen people of like
[471.66s -> 479.96s]  sharing like the weird stuff that they're making on Twitter. I don't, I don't want to get spoiled.
[481.82s -> 489.35s]  I haven't even beat breath of the wild. I haven't seen any footage of tears of the kingdom.
[491.29s -> 496.65s]  Okay. I've seen somebody make like a ball sack, right? Every, you've all seen it. Okay. I'm not
[496.65s -> 508.71s]  going to pretend I haven't seen it. What do you mean? What? Oh, working. What? You haven't seen
[508.71s -> 513.00s]  that? I haven't seen it. I haven't seen it. What do you mean? You guys haven't seen, you haven't
[513.00s -> 525.30s]  seen the ball sack from tears of the kingdom? Hold on. I mean, honey, you're a ball sack image
[525.30s -> 535.75s]  that I've seen. Have I seen a ball sack image on Twitter from tears of the kingdom? She said no.
[537.86s -> 548.49s]  Is there like a book, a ball sack? I need to look at something. Hold on a second.
[555.86s -> 564.55s]  I can't, I don't want, no, I'm not writing this. I'm not going to type this in. Can't you, you can
[564.55s -> 573.53s]  like make any object in tears of the kingdom, right? Isn't that like, Oh, look, the joke I made. Look,
[573.53s -> 591.42s]  I made like a bunch of crazy stuff. Kind of. Yeah. That's what I'm saying. God damn it. I'm hallucinating.
[598.30s -> 604.94s]  I swear to God, I didn't have a dream that, that people were making. Oh, look, I can combine any
[604.94s -> 611.82s]  object. And look, I made, I made a penis. Am I making that up? Did I have a dream that this
[611.82s -> 626.28s]  happened? Tell me the truth. I'm not making this up. Unless I had a dream that this happened.
[629.51s -> 636.15s]  You said ball sack. Yeah. You said, yeah, but that's why I meant the same, like kind of the
[636.15s -> 657.06s]  same kind of bullshit. All right. Anyways, Vinny made a flaccid penis on stream. Okay. So that,
[657.06s -> 661.06s]  so I know what I'm talking about. This is exactly what I was talking about. Sorry. I used,
[661.06s -> 667.22s]  I used the term ball sack. I used this. I said ball sack instead of, Oh, you didn't say flaccid
[667.22s -> 674.10s]  penis. Oh, those are not the same category. That was, I was talking about the category of,
[674.10s -> 683.26s]  of things that people are making. Sorry. I wasn't super specific. All right. You guys ready to
[683.26s -> 699.88s]  chill out on a chill stream today? You're weird, man. No, you're weird. You're the weird one. Okay.
[701.46s -> 705.54s]  Not super, you were super specific. You were just wrong. No, I'm just saying like, Oh,
[706.34s -> 711.46s]  I made a ball sack. I made a penis. I made a flaccid penis. It's there. They're in the same
[711.46s -> 719.06s]  category of comedic, comedic, phallic shaped object stuff that people can make in video games
[719.06s -> 723.69s]  with the right tools. And that can like, well, look what I did. Okay. There we go. I made my
[723.69s -> 736.97s]  statement. You said ball sack exclusively for so long. Yeah. But why do we have to pick out every
[736.97s -> 743.85s]  little, you said this and you said that and you didn't use it. You said that. Let's go.
[744.57s -> 755.30s]  You're digging yourself into a hole. I guys, I told you how I literally shit my pants like three
[755.30s -> 769.94s]  weeks ago. I did. I'm not, I'm, I'm very unbothered. All right. So how does this work? What do you mean?
[769.94s -> 775.54s]  Huh? Oh, they weren't here. Yeah. Let them go find it in the FOD somewhere. You know what I mean?
[776.73s -> 783.14s]  Okay. Draw something in the space below the cursor by moving the mouse, draw a line. We'll press.
[783.14s -> 792.42s]  Okay. So there we go. There it is. Draw something and have it touch the red ball.
[793.06s -> 809.72s]  That is not a red ball. That is a purple ball. Oh no. Hey everybody. I have the proper tools
[809.72s -> 813.80s]  to be able to make something really interesting here. Don't I?
[813.88s -> 829.82s]  I, it's eyes and here are the eyebrows. Oh shit. How do I clear this? What is it?
[833.42s -> 837.50s]  How do I kind of clear this? I have to change this right now. I have to change this right now
[837.50s -> 849.77s]  before I get in trouble. All right. Touch the left wall with the ball. Oh, oops. That. Okay.
[850.89s -> 857.94s]  You're a Reddit gamer. What does that even mean? Like I just, what do you mean by that?
[857.94s -> 863.94s]  Just like this is a game where you draw lines and push a ball to the other side of the,
[863.94s -> 871.27s]  what do you, why does it have to be a Reddit game? Okay. That's the left wall with your drawing.
[871.27s -> 876.87s]  Draw a stick and let it drop. Draw a slope and let something roll on it. The choice is yours.
[876.87s -> 893.27s]  Touch the left wall with your drawing. Oh, okay. Cool. New questions appeared. What is going on
[893.27s -> 906.10s]  here? There's a lot. Everyone. Hell. If you solve seven out of 10 questions, the next 10 questions
[906.10s -> 913.51s]  will appear. Oh, okay. I get it. Let's keep going. Touch the left wall with your drawing. Oh,
[913.51s -> 921.46s]  wait. I already did it. I got it. All right. So it's the next one here. Take the ball out.
[921.46s -> 927.45s]  All right. We're going to make a, how do I take the ball out? All right. We're going to go like
[927.45s -> 937.34s]  this and we're going to put, we're going to weigh it down, right? I mean, that was all right. I said
[937.34s -> 963.66s]  to do a little bit more. Get the ball out. I'm just going to fucking launch it with this like
[963.66s -> 1005.26s]  5,000 pound brick. What's fucking happening? This is not, it's not a mobile game ad. Quiet.
[1006.63s -> 1017.62s]  It's not a mobile game ad. You're wrong. Cause you haven't heard this yet. So you're wrong.
[1021.38s -> 1061.64s]  Take the ball out. Why can I not do this? I'm going to be honest. Did you take shrooms today?
[1061.64s -> 1079.48s]  We use more, you need more velocity? Is there actual velocity? Dude, I didn't know there was
[1079.48s -> 1084.86s]  actual velocity. I thought it was like based on, all right. Well, I was doing the right thing.
[1086.87s -> 1094.76s]  Make the ball touch the left wall. All right. Let's go. Watch this shit. Ready? All right.
[1094.76s -> 1100.49s]  We wanted to push it this way. So we're going to go like this. I'm just going to build this up
[1100.49s -> 1132.06s]  until we can get it to push stacks. Can I like prop stuff up? Hold on. What if I do this? Okay.
[1132.06s -> 1169.14s]  Ready? No, go this way. How would that have possibly gone that going that way? Is this a bit?
[1169.14s -> 1203.05s]  No, it's a physics based puzzle game. Now push that. Can I add weight? Okay. I'm starting to
[1203.05s -> 1219.90s]  understand that you can actually do long pieces. I'm trying to, I'm trying to make like a hook.
[1219.90s -> 1240.79s]  Why is it so heavy? But wait on the end of it. It has to hit the left wall. Oh, that was it.
[1240.79s -> 1264.63s]  Almost. Your IQ is going down so fast. You don't even, do you have no idea how IQ even works?
[1264.63s -> 1271.64s]  You don't even know how it works. Do it at the bottom. That was like making like,
[1271.64s -> 1287.67s]  make it like a, like a crowbar, like bend it. I don't think I can do that. This is a left brain
[1287.67s -> 1300.82s]  game. That's fine. I mean, I'll, I'll, I'll figure it out. I got it. Got it. Okay. There it goes.
[1303.67s -> 1325.11s]  All right. Now what do I do? Now we crushed this. Um, this is too long. What the fuck? I want to
[1325.11s -> 1335.14s]  put, can I like push it from this way instead? Not really. Chat, you're losing it. Chat's losing
[1335.14s -> 1341.00s]  it right now. Yeah. Let me tell you something about chat. They can sit there and eat their popcorn
[1341.00s -> 1345.64s]  and scream about how I'm not doing this right. But when they get to level seven on their own time,
[1345.64s -> 1351.02s]  they're going to go, thank fucking God. Nobody's watching me do this. Wait, is he still on chat?
[1351.02s -> 1361.19s]  Is he still on six? Fucking idiot. You're a fucking stupid idiot. All right. I'm thinking
[1361.75s -> 1372.74s]  just a bunch of weight here and then connect it like this shit. Or like, can I just like go
[1372.74s -> 1390.33s]  like this and just punch it, but wait on the other end. So there is weight. All right. I'm
[1390.33s -> 1395.29s]  starting. All right. All right. I know that there's real weight. I know. All right. I didn't,
[1395.29s -> 1414.81s]  I didn't really know that. Now check this out. Will this stick to walls? Oh, all right. I have
[1414.81s -> 1423.32s]  to have, this has to touch the left wall. Is it possible that I can make noise? So I can't attach
[1423.32s -> 1447.99s]  things, right? Okay. I can catch them like that. Not really though. How do I get this to, all right.
[1447.99s -> 1472.25s]  It's got to be, catch it all like that. But then how do I, your A, let me tell you something. If
[1472.25s -> 1479.98s]  you write the same thing a thousand times, it's not going to help me. It's like you guys, you guys
[1479.98s -> 1485.74s]  are at like the zoo right now. Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid. Hey, can you hear me boy? Hey,
[1485.82s -> 1491.35s]  can you hear me behind the glass? You're stupid. I just wait to one of the, wait to one of the zoo
[1491.99s -> 1498.23s]  fucking workers comes out there and throws you out. Don't tap on the glass. I'm busy.
[1498.23s -> 1514.50s]  Okay. I need to work backwards. So if I were to go like this, I'm just,
[1514.50s -> 1521.85s]  I'm just curious what happens here. And there it is. Now I just have to very carefully try to make,
[1521.93s -> 1548.15s]  Oh, fuck you. Not you. Shit. I almost did it. Wait. Shit. Damn it.
[1550.07s -> 1576.78s]  But how do I get the ball to move? I feel like it's, I can just have a ball hit it like this,
[1576.78s -> 1593.19s]  but it bounces too fucking high. Chill stream. Relax. All right. That should be fine. That'll
[1593.19s -> 1610.60s]  do it right there. Yes. Now everybody sit down. Finally. Hey, finally. Hey, excuse me. Zoo
[1610.60s -> 1617.18s]  attendant. Yes. Hey, am I allowed to throw stuff? No, no, you've, you've never been allowed to do
[1617.18s -> 1625.46s]  that. Oh, too bad. Too bad. I could scream at him though, right? Well, technically no. Oh, okay.
[1625.46s -> 1628.66s]  Can you get a picture of me in front of, uh, giving the peace sign and like the middle finger.
[1629.30s -> 1646.89s]  Can I get a picture of that? Two years supporting this clown. Well, that's accurate. Thanks though.
[1649.10s -> 1656.01s]  You need to be studied because I didn't figure out a physics based open-ended puzzle
[1656.25s -> 1664.54s]  level in the time that you have allocated for me to do so. This guy had trouble with a physics
[1664.54s -> 1683.88s]  based puzzle. Study his brain. Okay. All right. Watch this one. What? Oh, I can't draw in the blue.
[1683.88s -> 1700.14s]  Okay. So I can, can I just go like this? Draw something and touch the red area. Can I build
[1700.14s -> 1713.21s]  just like, like a staple tower? I think that makes sense. And then just kind of from here, I guess
[1715.00s -> 1727.10s]  make like a little bridge and then study him. Study his brain. Study his brain. Oh no.
[1727.10s -> 1736.78s]  Put five balls in the plate below can be done heavily if drawn persistently at the same point.
[1736.78s -> 1756.09s]  Put five balls in the plate. Uh, how do I get them out of here? All right. Can I just drop like a
[1756.09s -> 1763.11s]  huge, like, can I just like a big like grenade? I think I can do a big grenade. Okay. That's what
[1763.11s -> 1772.36s]  I'm going for here. Yep. All right. I'm thinking big, big grenade. And then once I get them up here,
[1773.32s -> 1816.94s]  they're going to go like this. I need them to go like this. Fuck. Um, okay. How do I undo? Okay.
[1816.94s -> 1867.06s]  How do I get them to get out of here? I win. What? I don't know. You didn't say what balls need to go
[1867.06s -> 1881.37s]  in there. I win. That should work. I have balls in the plate, but how do I get them to get out of
[1881.37s -> 1911.75s]  here? I need to scoop them. Can I like drag them out? Let me scoop one. Can be done heavily
[1914.06s -> 1918.92s]  if drawn persistently at the same point. I don't even know what that's telling me to do.
[1927.93s -> 1948.36s]  You need a big scoop. Hold for more weight. Actually real. Wait, are you serious? Hold on.
[1948.36s -> 1963.40s]  Are you actually kidding? Hold the mouse down in the same spot. That doesn't work. Hold. I,
[1963.40s -> 1972.36s]  what do you think I'm doing? I'm holding it right now. You liars. Please read heavily. I don't know
[1972.36s -> 1990.78s]  what that can be done heavily if drawn persistently at the same point. What are they talking about?
[1990.78s -> 1999.59s]  Bigger ball is more weight. Yeah. I figured that out. It didn't really do anything though.
[1999.59s -> 2010.82s]  I tried this already. Wait, if I miss me filling it in like this actually doing stuff,
[2010.82s -> 2023.61s]  like spending more time like this. Well, okay. That's good to know. I thought it was just make
[2023.61s -> 2029.59s]  a ball and it would be heavier, but apparently I have to like go like this inside of it too.
[2030.15s -> 2046.62s]  It's literally not how it works. All right. That has to do it right.
[2077.82s -> 2101.54s]  Make a triangle. Make it point this way. Hey, that kind of looks like Nevada. That's where I live.
[2118.94s -> 2125.45s]  Dude, you can't fit it in there. Make it smaller. You can't. I can't make it smaller. This is as
[2125.45s -> 2148.14s]  big as I can make it. I can't fit anything down here. Do it from the ceiling. I can't put it
[2148.14s -> 2218.34s]  higher than this. Get in there. Yes. All right. I got one. No, I don't. Okay. I'm thinking have a
[2218.34s -> 2223.42s]  big flat top like this. So there's a ton of weight because I can't go higher than this
[2223.42s -> 2237.91s]  and it'll just smash right through. It'd be like a nail driving in. I mean that didn't really work,
[2237.91s -> 2263.58s]  but I might be okay. It was too close. All right. So that I need more velocity. I this is,
[2263.58s -> 2282.38s]  I can't go higher than this. Make a true wedge. I'm going back here and I'm going to make it a
[2282.38s -> 2297.91s]  big ball with a point right here. I can't make it heavier than this, but there's no way for me to
[2297.91s -> 2304.07s]  make this heavier. I just have to get lucky and get it to actually hit balls out like that.
[2304.07s -> 2310.58s]  And there it was. I apparently, apparently this was the right object. This like
[2310.58s -> 2314.90s]  fucked up piece of shit that I made. It was the right one. So I was going to remember that.
[2314.90s -> 2376.94s]  There it is. One, two, three. I can get these. God damn it. One, two, one, two, three. We're good
[2376.94s -> 2408.57s]  right here. I wish that just, it wasn't this high because you can't get any real weight or leverage
[2408.57s -> 2439.02s]  from this. Don't even say skill issue. I'll tell you about personally. One, two, three.
[2439.02s -> 2463.22s]  Fuck you. Come on. Right here. All right. I need literally one more. There it is. Get out of here.
[2463.22s -> 2498.28s]  Arrow dynamic Andy. Arrow dynamic Andy. Take the ball out. You got it. That was embarrassing. Well,
[2498.28s -> 2505.86s]  here's the thing. It wasn't embarrassing for me. So you are putting, you are putting on embarrassment
[2505.86s -> 2536.55s]  on me that I do not have. I'm fine. I feel great. I feel good. Why did I think that was going to
[2536.55s -> 2579.61s]  happen? Pull it down. Come on. Check this out. All backwards. Oh, why is it falling forwards?
[2579.61s -> 2597.00s]  All backwards. This guy does not get physics. Neither do you. Neither do you. What do you know?
[2597.00s -> 2601.64s]  You don't know. What do you know? What do you know about physics? Huh? Did you write a paper on it?
[2601.64s -> 2624.65s]  What do you know? Hey, what do you know about aerodynamics? I have an idea. All right. Wait
[2624.65s -> 2665.53s]  a minute. Hold on. Somebody just said they laughed out loud. Stop question marking me.
[2665.53s -> 2682.22s]  I didn't do anything wrong. I didn't do anything wrong. Pull it back. Pull it back. What are you
[2682.22s -> 2688.28s]  doing? That's not, that's not how you fly a plane. Are you out of your mind? What are you doing?
[2688.92s -> 2696.42s]  There it is. I got it. I actually got it. That's definitely, that's it right there.
[2696.42s -> 2705.35s]  I win. Oh, question marks, question marks. Over that. This is not a chance in hell that I didn't
[2705.35s -> 2710.90s]  just take that from mod chat. No way. Not actually physically possible that I, that I
[2710.90s -> 2719.21s]  took that directly from a mod who drew that exact thing to do. Um, make the ball touch the left
[2719.21s -> 2761.18s]  wall. You got it. I want to see, I want to be able to freak out. I want to make it so it can't go
[2761.18s -> 2770.20s]  down. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Like this. I want to, why can I draw where I want to draw?
[2771.66s -> 2786.04s]  All right. So now it can't go this way. So it has to just go, looks in the right spot.
[2786.04s -> 2794.52s]  Like I'm playing a claw machine. There it is. You question marking. I just beat it.
[2805.19s -> 2832.30s]  I don't know. I have no idea. I almost need to see this burst. I need to, because it needs to be
[2832.30s -> 2839.80s]  heavy here to fall this way hard to launch this up. But how do I get that to actually do like,
[2839.80s -> 2849.14s]  do I have to do, I need to draw it. I wish there was a, like a paint mode. Because if I go like
[2850.57s -> 2882.14s]  this, will it like, no, I need to like a thing to just launch it up. Oh,
[2891.24s -> 2931.56s]  Oh, what do you know about that? Huh? Oh shit. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I don't,
[2931.56s -> 2937.13s]  I don't know how this works. I don't have a physics degree. Okay. I don't,
[2938.07s -> 2942.95s]  do you understand like where leverage points are to pick up a toy on the ground?
[2942.95s -> 2963.50s]  It needs to be further out like here. What are you, I didn't want to hit space idiot.
[2979.72s -> 2983.50s]  This end on the right side, this side has to be longer than this side. How the fuck am I going
[2983.50s -> 2999.62s]  to do that? Hold on. No, I need to, it's so funny going over and looking at the chat here.
[2999.62s -> 3005.10s]  It's just people screaming their interpretation of what they think I should do. You tap them on the
[3005.10s -> 3016.54s]  glass right now. Like how am I supposed to read any of this? How did I graduate? I didn't go to
[3016.54s -> 3030.71s]  college for physics. I didn't go to school for physics. Huh? Bro, I can't believe you graduated
[3030.71s -> 3070.98s]  from your physics math college. I didn't. That's it right there. Come on, grab them. No, I'm just
[3070.98s -> 3082.39s]  too much. You got, that can't be, it's got to be like a bow in the middle right there. Bang.
[3082.39s -> 3144.63s]  Don't forget about the counterweight. I almost had it. Okay. Shh. Where am I sir? Shit. I can't
[3144.63s -> 3178.74s]  make him stand up. All right. That's going to be bigger. No, I didn't want to hold stuff a little
[3178.74s -> 3205.43s]  too long. Yeah. Oh, that's going to be way easier. Why did I not, why would I do not, this is going
[3205.51s -> 3232.65s]  to work in only like a couple of tries. Why did I overcomplicate this? This is so much easier.
[3232.65s -> 3260.23s]  Oh my God. I just heard it. Okay. I heard that from across the whole fucking, I heard that from
[3260.23s -> 3289.22s]  far away. I was really far away. There it is. Don't fall forward. Have, no. Stop this shit at once.
[3295.26s -> 3300.04s]  Ooh, wait. No, no, no. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.
[3300.92s -> 3332.41s]  Just stay right there. We're fine. Draw something and touch the red area. You got it. Yeah. Don't
[3332.41s -> 3340.86s]  worry. I know how to get up there. I've played Tetris before and lost every time. I have an idea.
[3340.86s -> 3363.91s]  I have an idea. Watch this. Take this out. Oh, you guys are going to fucking freak out when you see
[3363.91s -> 3410.31s]  this. That's the right idea. The ball was just too big. See you. Make the ball touch the ground.
[3410.31s -> 3414.22s]  All right. This is going to, this is going to take us a little while. I think you ever heard of a
[3414.22s -> 3420.82s]  square. I want that person permanently banned and then I want you to unban them. And I want,
[3420.82s -> 3426.44s]  I want them to give a paragraph as to why they think this should be allowed back.
[3426.44s -> 3449.43s]  Okay. All right. Let's just like fuck the whole thing up. How does this sound? Oh man. Okay. Is
[3449.43s -> 3467.62s]  this like stupid? No, almost not really. Hold on. Almost not really. Wait a second. Wait a second.
[3468.36s -> 3494.22s]  Wait a second. There it is. I just got to weigh this down. There it is. Oh, what happened? Okay.
[3494.22s -> 3505.96s]  Cool. Oh, wait a minute. Okay. We're at, where are we? Primary one. Okay. Yeah. I'm not ready
[3505.96s -> 3511.72s]  for that. Make the ball touch the weight. I already did this. Didn't I already do this one?
[3511.72s -> 3532.20s]  How's this one different? Make the ball touch the left wall. I did it already. Yes, I did. Oh,
[3532.20s -> 3567.26s]  it's just to get it out before. Oh shit. That's okay. That is different. I just, just wait
[3567.26s -> 3607.50s]  before you do your question marks. Just wait a second. I'm fucking up and oh, it's really heavy.
[3607.50s -> 3698.26s]  Come on. That's gotta be it. Yay. Oh, not yet. Wait, you're doing the same thing over and over
[3698.26s -> 3706.73s]  again. That's what I'm trying to. Yeah. Well, you have to, I'm deducing what's going on.
[3706.73s -> 3723.67s]  Turn the music off. Yeah. Let's get it. Let's get our own soundtrack in here because this is,
[3723.67s -> 3738.18s]  yeah. How about, give me an OST. Did it again. Guys, that's what you do. Hold on. I'm not quite
[3738.18s -> 3756.07s]  ready yet. Can I even save this? How about, what do you guys think? How you guys doing?
[3756.07s -> 3761.03s]  You could turn off music and then just play, we could play our own. That's a really smart way to
[3761.03s -> 3767.40s]  do this. Um, people will get mad if it's not coming through my stream. That's a very smart
[3767.40s -> 3776.68s]  thing to do though. All right. How about, um, pizza tower? Yeah. I love that so much, but
[3780.46s -> 3785.10s]  animal crossing. Yeah. Animal crossing is pretty damn good. Celeste is really good too. How about,
[3785.10s -> 3795.29s]  um, yeah, let's go with animal crossing. Which one though? Super Mario world. Oh,
[3795.29s -> 3800.50s]  that's a good one too. I'm doing that first. Super Mario world for the S N S O S T.
[3801.06s -> 3832.81s]  And let me turn this off. Uh, what is it? There we go. Uh, here it is. Is it? Yep. Yeah. That sounds
[3832.81s -> 3898.50s]  good to me. Shit. This is too big. What are you doing? Damn it. Hold on. I'll get it. You need
[3898.50s -> 3903.22s]  enough weight to pull it back and then you need the support here to really give it the leverage
[3903.22s -> 3976.01s]  that like, but then what the hell? Hold on. I think I actually just did it. No. Now what needs to
[3976.01s -> 3993.21s]  happen? Fulcrum fulcrum fulcrum. What is a fulcrum fulcrum fulcrum? That's the first time I've ever
[3993.21s -> 4005.14s]  heard that word. I don't know what that is. I'm telling you right now. I've never heard that word
[4005.14s -> 4014.34s]  said out loud point on which a lever rests or is supported and on which it pivots the pivot point.
[4014.34s -> 4019.98s]  Pivot point sounds way better than fulcrum. Fulcrum actually sounds pretty cool though.
[4019.98s -> 4024.89s]  Fulcrum is actually now I'm going to start using that because I actually kind of like that. Nice,
[4025.05s -> 4032.58s]  dude. All right. All right. So the pivot point, I need a different pivot point. Don't use words
[4032.58s -> 4044.71s]  that I don't understand. Oh my goodness. Okay. I'm almost there. I just have to fix this and it's
[4044.71s -> 4057.02s]  good. Watch this. This is stupid and it's really bad idea, but I'm going to go for it. I've ruined
[4057.02s -> 4064.92s]  it. I didn't have the fulcrum in the right spot. I still think I can do this though. Watch this.
[4064.92s -> 4087.61s]  I didn't want to click again. I got the fulcrum point in the right spot. That was much better.
[4087.61s -> 4121.64s]  So it needs to like pivot here, but how you can't change the width of your lines. That's why it's
[4121.64s -> 4130.47s]  kind of hard to do this. Push it down from the right side. That's actually not a bad idea. It's
[4130.47s -> 4138.84s]  going to just wedge it in there. Let's actually do something. Hold on. I didn't actually win.
[4138.84s -> 4148.17s]  So that music doesn't make sense. You're getting mocked by the music. Oh, wait a minute. Hold on.
[4148.17s -> 4162.79s]  Why do I think it has to be in one piece? Right? I got to put the fulcrum down here.
[4168.65s -> 4195.18s]  All right. Now what happens? Got it. Almost. Almost. Fulcrum's got to go right here. Okay.
[4195.18s -> 4221.53s]  I didn't want to do that. Now just smash the whole thing with a rock and it'll fix itself.
[4221.53s -> 4239.42s]  Pull it. Oh, shit. It's almost there. I can't. I think I got it though. If I knock this down,
[4239.42s -> 4258.04s]  uh, fulcrum is too high. We're going to do double fulcrum. I think that works.
[4258.04s -> 4286.31s]  Double fulcrum into pull, grab. I just freaked out. I almost had it though. Bro, are you, I'm tweaking?
[4286.31s -> 4302.17s]  What? Is it going to do anything? I'm just doing this to make it look like I'm, I'm doing better.
[4302.17s -> 4366.95s]  Wait, weigh him down. Fuck. Let's do it again. Shit. One or two is fine. Is that in a good spot?
[4366.95s -> 4379.10s]  It's hard to tell. No, it keeps hitting it. Stop doing the claw. Well, how do I get it to pull down?
[4379.10s -> 4404.82s]  The claw works. You just got to make sure it's small. How big should I make the fulcrum? I feel
[4404.82s -> 4410.34s]  like the fulcrum needs to be further in. I can't color the fulcrum in. And I did learn a new word
[4410.34s -> 4427.96s]  today. So I'm going to use it many more times tonight. It's not heavy enough. Make it wider.
[4427.96s -> 4454.62s]  This is the one right here. This is it. It's got to be in tighter, like here. Why can I not color
[4454.62s -> 4468.81s]  this in? Stop doing the triangles. All right. I got to pull it over this. I got it. That's the one
[4468.81s -> 4487.83s]  done pretty much. But now I can, can I, I can, I, I, can I, can I fix it? I almost need to make,
[4487.83s -> 4493.88s]  okay. Hold on. Let me draw this out. Here's the fulcrum point, which is where it's going to tip.
[4493.88s -> 4499.48s]  It's going to hit this, pull it tip. So it's going to tip. So let's weigh it down here
[4499.48s -> 4509.51s]  and let's make a line. The point of this fulcrum. See what I'm saying? So now when it pulls down,
[4510.15s -> 4516.17s]  it can't get all screwed up. So now what's going to happen is I'm going to pull it down. It's going
[4516.17s -> 4554.58s]  to go over here. Ball's going to fall out. What do I do? What do I do? Okay. I'm going for it.
[4554.58s -> 4590.22s]  Yeah. Right when we got to Bowser's castle. All right. Take the ball out. Okay. That's the
[4590.22s -> 4630.94s]  right idea. Hit it with a bowling ball. It is a little extra weight Alex in the container. Okay.
[4630.94s -> 4648.26s]  Let's go. I'm going to do a mini one. Okay. Now the idea is to hit this, hit them, hit them right
[4648.26s -> 4678.28s]  in the bottom of the chin, fly them up. He's getting in. Where'd he go? Okay. Well, I guess
[4678.28s -> 4688.38s]  he's gone. Is it too high? Is he eventually going to fall down? I don't know. That's definitely the
[4688.38s -> 4704.20s]  right idea though. It's supposed to be a little bit smaller, not as powerful. Well, it went the
[4704.20s -> 4750.18s]  wrong way. Perfect. God damn it. No, no, no. Just wait. I should have gone from up here. I got him.
[4750.18s -> 4797.64s]  I'm going to pull him in. Hook strat. I fucking ruined it. You better come back down. I'm going
[4797.64s -> 4838.74s]  to be pissed. No, wrong way. This is it. This is the one right here. Okay. I'm not going to
[4838.74s -> 4851.78s]  mess around. Not huge, but big enough to get the weight. There he goes. And thank you. Clutch at
[4851.78s -> 4862.68s]  the end there. That was clutch at the end there. I think I can take that one. That's pretty clutch.
[4862.68s -> 4884.20s]  Make the ball touch the red area. First try. First try. I just made a tank. Suma wrestler,
[4884.20s -> 4900.66s]  touch the left wall. Got it. Check this out. You might've thought that was a mistake. If I wasn't
[4900.66s -> 4906.09s]  talking, it would have been fine. I was, I was villain monologuing and lost when I had the whole
[4906.09s -> 4920.95s]  fucking thing one. All right. Make the ball touch the left wall. All right. This is going to be
[4920.95s -> 4930.25s]  interesting. Okay. Let's go with the tank strat with the long stick hanging out. And then we're
[4930.25s -> 4937.42s]  going to add to that. I'm going to put a little bit more weight down here. Boom. Now we're going
[4937.42s -> 4961.19s]  to restart. Just like scrape it with just with your weird like finger. The idea is to have the ball
[4962.07s -> 4969.74s]  right here. Be the thing that smashes into the side with my physics based technology
[4969.74s -> 4986.66s]  with patented physics based ball creation technology. Patented physics based ball
[4986.66s -> 5039.78s]  weight technology. Make the shape face right. You got it. You know exactly what I'm doing here.
[5039.78s -> 5053.78s]  I don't know anything besides rock smash something. You know it's happening. I know how to do a
[5053.78s -> 5093.99s]  see-saws. Oh, we've got a little bit of a counterweight problem. Fulcrum. We take fulcrum
[5093.99s -> 5114.74s]  in a big good spot. Bit by poisonous snake. Feel face scaling numb. Oh, good thing we have continuous.
[5114.74s -> 5126.49s]  This is the one right there. There's a little saliva in my mouth. You know, it's the real one.
[5126.49s -> 5188.94s]  Fucking thing. What are you talking about? It's stuck on the wall. There it is. Oh, how was it?
[5188.94s -> 5202.71s]  Why is the face the other way? My family is in my living room watching you play this for an hour
[5202.71s -> 5206.95s]  straight and my dad has been getting pissed at you not knowing what a fulcrum is and now he's
[5206.95s -> 5213.85s]  yelling at the screen because you're hook strats. Hold on a second, dad. First of all, I appreciate
[5213.85s -> 5220.30s]  the constructive feedback on how I'm playing this game. I appreciate the constructive feedback.
[5222.26s -> 5227.48s]  But, I don't know. I was about to just like start screaming at whoever this is.
[5230.58s -> 5241.67s]  But then, I don't know. I feel like whoever the son or daughter is in this case, I feel like they'd
[5241.67s -> 5246.09s]  be like, oh my God, I got to switch to somebody else like right now. Quick, quick, quick,
[5246.09s -> 5255.53s]  switch to somebody else. And who else is streaming right now? I don't care who it is. Okay, I'm going
[5255.53s -> 5267.51s]  to be fine. I have an idea. My idea is very simple. See, what we have to do is we make the
[5267.51s -> 5279.69s]  fulcrum point here, add the seesaw bit right here, and very easy. We get Batman to show up
[5279.69s -> 5288.98s]  and we crush him. We kill the Batman. Oh, Joker, you have no idea what you're doing.
[5289.94s -> 5297.38s]  You can't complete this puzzle game. We're going to have any characters show up on Jerma's stream.
[5300.31s -> 5319.45s]  Shut up. Dad just laughed out loud. I heard it. I could hear it through the television.
[5319.45s -> 5327.14s]  I heard dad laugh at the television after that one, and I'm not happy about it.
[5351.11s -> 5385.90s]  What was the point of drawing these? I'm just going to do the hook again. What? What am I doing?
[5385.90s -> 5392.31s]  I don't know. Stop the hook bullshit. Stop the hook bullshit. I'm doing it the other way.
[5392.31s -> 5405.37s]  I had a good idea. I need a way better fulcrum like that. Now see this. Now hear this. See this.
[5405.37s -> 5415.77s]  You seeing this? Watch this. This is going to be unbelievable. Dad, hold on to the couch
[5415.77s -> 5444.38s]  because here it comes. Hold on to something. Hey, hey, it's very funny. Hey, son or daughter,
[5444.38s -> 5449.00s]  come and give me a hug. What a great bonding experience this was between us.
[5449.00s -> 5453.82s]  Exactly what I'm looking for. That's what I'm looking for. What a bonding experience
[5454.14s -> 5460.14s]  you had over this. That's great. I'm glad. I hope the strength of your family is stronger now.
[5460.14s -> 5504.55s]  What the hell is this? What is this? Still Mario? This is not Mario anymore. Any mods in here that
[5504.55s -> 5526.84s]  can give me a hand with this? That's a good idea. I think it's a combination of hook strategy
[5526.84s -> 5535.38s]  and ball strategy. Two of my favorite things in the game. Now that's going to work. That's
[5535.38s -> 5553.27s]  a combination of hook and ball strategy. Maybe up a little higher. Make a scooper like that.
[5553.27s -> 5579.62s]  Kind of. It needs to be small. Even smaller than that? Really? This will do it. That's it
[5579.62s -> 5586.65s]  right there. Oh my god. Make the ball heavier, not bigger. I don't, I don't know what that means
[5586.65s -> 5594.90s]  because I don't, I don't get what you mean. Was that actually a thing in the game or were people
[5594.90s -> 5613.35s]  making that up? It's real. So if I just sit here and hold the button down like this, this will be
[5613.35s -> 5622.97s]  much heavier. Give it a point. That's the one right there. All right. All right. We're halfway
[5622.97s -> 5630.81s]  there. I now I'm thinking hook strategy here. I just have to push this over. Here's my idea.
[5630.81s -> 5645.85s]  I don't think it's going to work, but I could try. I'm thinking make a long road and just drop a
[5645.85s -> 5657.05s]  boulder down here, but I don't think that's going to do it. Put a hook on the hook. Why did I even
[5657.05s -> 5663.75s]  listen to that person? Why did I listen to that person? But make, hold on, make like one of these.
[5663.75s -> 5720.79s]  Will that like help kind of move it? Come on, stop. Maybe that little dip will be enough. Smash.
[5720.79s -> 5729.50s]  All right. This is not horrible, but it kind of is horrible. It's too long. It needs to be way shorter.
[5729.50s -> 5738.68s]  But this needs to be longer and this needs to be shorter. This needs to be barely right there.
[5741.13s -> 5747.08s]  Now we're going to make a first hook. Is this too big? You think this is too big?
[5747.08s -> 5773.88s]  That's my favorite item from Costco. Um, uh, I don't know. Cheese. I do like the point though.
[5773.88s -> 5782.07s]  Make this sort of like a triangle. Have a point that just smushes right onto that line. I want
[5782.07s -> 5790.47s]  this thing to flip. It's upright. All right. It's upright, but how do I get it to go all the way?
[5790.47s -> 5847.53s]  Cause I can't delete anything. It'd be a fulcrum. I need something to wedge under it as it flips.
[5847.53s -> 5880.20s]  Something over here. Maybe if I go like this, will it push this? I don't know. Oh, no.
[5880.76s -> 5901.11s]  Flip it the other way. Can I flip it? Hold on. Let me cook for a second. Watch this.
[5901.11s -> 5966.86s]  Didn't even think about that. Did we? Didn't think about this. Did we? My dad is screaming at me.
[5966.86s -> 6004.79s]  Hurry, dude. You're evolving backwards. Please. You don't have to do every level, but I'm,
[6004.79s -> 6013.08s]  I want to see, I want to try. He needs a recipe book. VOD watchers skip an hour. You know,
[6013.08s -> 6018.71s]  when I'm watching a VOD and I look over a chat and I see some, and I'm just hanging out with my,
[6018.71s -> 6025.11s]  you know, sandwich and my, you know, my large turkey sandwich, lettuce, mustard, mayo mix,
[6025.11s -> 6030.82s]  tomato, one thin sliced tomato. Just kidding. Take that off. Don't put that on any food.
[6030.82s -> 6041.35s]  Lettuce, mayo with some turkey stalling. I don't like looking over and people going,
[6041.35s -> 6047.77s]  Hey, skip for an hour. I don't, I don't tell me what to do. You just spoiled that the stream,
[6047.77s -> 6051.88s]  the streamer didn't, you know, I don't tell me what to do. You shouldn't be telling the
[6051.88s -> 6058.41s]  VOD watchers what to do. VOD watchers skip an hour. That's their decision. They just did,
[6058.41s -> 6105.34s]  but at least it was their call, not yours. Insecure Andy. I'm just fucking, I need to see how it
[6105.34s -> 6167.16s]  bounces. Okay. You need a fulcrum. Make Alex touch the right wall. You got it. Okay. When in doubt,
[6167.16s -> 6179.98s]  when in doubt, you just, just use the hook. I don't think I can do anything with the tail,
[6179.98s -> 6214.26s]  this stuff on the way. Right wall. Okay. So if I go like this, what music is playing?
[6214.26s -> 6304.46s]  A club penguin, I guess. Uh, what else? Use a hammer. Okay. That's an ax. What? No, wrong.
[6311.69s -> 6334.22s]  Really? What do you mean? Touch the ground with the red object. A little bit of a claw strategy
[6334.22s -> 6377.98s]  will work pretty good. Shit. Pull it off. Just have to touch the ground. All right. Now I need
[6377.98s -> 6406.52s]  to knock this over. Touch the ground. Touch the ground. Oh my God. Uh, yes. That's the red area
[6406.52s -> 6425.32s]  with your drawing. You can't draw in the blue area. Um, don't need a fulcrum on that one. Make
[6425.32s -> 6443.72s]  the ball touch the left wall. What do you think? Oh, let me talk about Gen loss for a little bit.
[6443.72s -> 6450.78s]  So those who didn't see, uh, generation loss, it was Rambo's show. It's a three day event. It was
[6450.78s -> 6454.73s]  really, really cool. I'll just give you a, I know that, um, there's been a lot of behind the scenes
[6454.73s -> 6464.36s]  stuff you may have seen, but, uh, I don't know how much anybody was paying attention or knows or
[6464.36s -> 6471.02s]  the second day, uh, Rambo and I came up with a lot of that stuff together. So it was really fun.
[6471.02s -> 6483.50s]  That was a long time ago too. The hook longer on the left side. Yeah. I'm thinking like this.
[6483.50s -> 6495.37s]  That's not a hook. Now it is. I was really excited because obviously Rambo had this incredible
[6495.37s -> 6504.34s]  passion project and it was kind of just like, Hey, do you want to do this? And then originally
[6504.34s -> 6513.96s]  I was potentially going to be in a mask. Uh, Rambo was like, Hey, what if we just put you in
[6513.96s -> 6520.46s]  a bunch of prosthetics? Cause that mass that I had was going to be, Oh, what are we going to, I guess
[6520.46s -> 6524.54s]  try to speed a mass. Should I have like makeup on? Should I, you know, should we make me look,
[6524.54s -> 6530.20s]  how do we do it? And it gave me this great excuse to get into all that prosthetics,
[6530.20s -> 6550.57s]  touch the left wall. And I do, I have this mold. It is a one-to-one complete replica of my face.
[6551.13s -> 6564.25s]  Like I said earlier, down to every pore. It is better than HD. Show it. I'll show it one day.
[6564.25s -> 6569.08s]  You need to smash that. You're repeating yourself. I know cause I'm thinking and I can't do,
[6569.08s -> 6585.98s]  I can't talk and think at the same time, but it was really cool to be a part of it. I remember,
[6587.72s -> 6594.18s]  so that, that Wonka kind of like candy room. I remember I was writing it down and I'm just
[6594.18s -> 6600.10s]  sitting there going, is this like, is this going to be in the show? Is this going to like make it?
[6601.37s -> 6612.49s]  And it did. I was really happy about it. I hung out with a lot of really cool people,
[6612.49s -> 6616.73s]  got to meet a lot of new people and a lot of people that I've never communicated with
[6616.73s -> 6627.53s]  like ever before. Obviously it was really cool to, to see Vinny. That's the first time me and Vinny
[6627.53s -> 6638.92s]  have seen each other since like PAX 2015 or something. So that was really, really awesome.
[6638.92s -> 6668.28s]  I'm not doing this right. This is making me irrationally angry. Well, at, at least you're
[6668.28s -> 6673.85s]  aware of that. You know what I mean? Like this is making me irrationally angry. It's actually
[6673.85s -> 6678.81s]  really important for you to kind of decipher that this is a rational anger. It's a rational what
[6678.81s -> 6684.38s]  you're saying, right? You've been being mindful of that. That's really, really important. Time
[6684.38s -> 6707.59s]  that person up for an hour. Shit. Can I have some help? Can anybody help me? I know what I have to
[6707.59s -> 6718.07s]  do, but I can't visualize it. Yeah. Walking around those sets. That was absolutely the biggest
[6718.07s -> 6734.98s]  project I've ever been a part of, ever been on. There were so many individual sets. Now, you know,
[6734.98s -> 6744.90s]  honestly hats off to Rambo for having the, you know, having the ability to want to put on something
[6744.90s -> 6749.99s]  like that and to be able to be that passionate about something. I'd love to see that stuff
[6749.99s -> 6759.82s]  because that's, it's not easy. It really isn't. So honestly hats off to Rambo and everybody else,
[6759.82s -> 6766.17s]  obviously that was working on the project too. It was really, really, it was, it was exciting.
[6766.17s -> 6775.72s]  It was fun. I got to go in prosthetics and be a fucking weirdo for like six hours. And I think,
[6775.72s -> 6780.68s]  I think he wants to do more. I think there's, I think that's, I don't know, he seemed pretty
[6780.68s -> 6791.86s]  excited to like kind of keep doing more stuff. It's like, hell yeah. That's, I love it. What
[6791.86s -> 6803.94s]  about your ass breaking the door? Yeah. I mean, I, my ass didn't break the door. I broke the door
[6803.94s -> 6811.16s]  with my body and then I kind of, at the very end, my ass was sort of the jokey part that I could say
[6811.16s -> 6818.36s]  broke it. I didn't actually break the door with my ass. It, it was perceived that way because I
[6818.36s -> 6823.00s]  mean, obviously that's what exactly what it looked like. And then I'm seeing a lot of copium and
[6823.00s -> 6833.74s]  CAPAs. I, all right, I stopped making a long hook over and over again and do it right. Were you
[6833.74s -> 6841.94s]  actually stuck? Kind of, I kind of, because those doors were made, were not, they were not operational.
[6841.94s -> 6846.78s]  It was like, there were people that were opening and closing those two doors. Like they were
[6846.78s -> 6851.74s]  opening them and closing them. And I kind of just pushed it, going through it too fast.
[6851.74s -> 6862.06s]  This, yeah, they were like Star Trek doors. The reveal of the two foot long revolver.
[6866.92s -> 6882.95s]  At least we're making music. I'm sorry about this. Draw the weight on the left side. All right,
[6882.95s -> 6903.61s]  I can pay attention again. How do I get the ball over there? Terma straight up murders someone. Yeah.
[6904.33s -> 6915.24s]  I remember when we were talking about that scene, I was like, okay, so I'm, I, I, I'm gonna shoot her.
[6918.10s -> 6922.18s]  Whoever it is. Because the way that that was going to work out was it was always going to have to be
[6922.18s -> 6929.78s]  somebody, right? There were only two or three people that could have been in there. So it was
[6929.78s -> 6934.02s]  like, okay, who could it even be? Who is the, who are the possible candidates that could be in this
[6934.02s -> 6939.14s]  room? Because obviously that was the chat interaction and stuff too. So as we're going through, it's
[6939.14s -> 6945.90s]  like, okay, so it could be you. It could be you. It could be, all right. So now how, so I have to
[6945.90s -> 6971.22s]  shoot someone. How do I move this? This is a mobile ad. I know it's a mobile ad. I'm skipping this one.
[6971.22s -> 6975.46s]  Also, if you wanted something interesting, let me talk about this because this is, and let me turn
[6975.46s -> 6984.23s]  this music down because this is weird. So during the first three rooms, so the, the surgery room,
[6984.23s -> 6990.89s]  the carousel room and the electric zap key room, I didn't have any direction in my ear.
[6992.65s -> 7000.73s]  So if you're wondering why I didn't pick the right person on the carousel is because I had,
[7000.73s -> 7004.57s]  I did not know who it was because we didn't, I didn't have it in my ear because I had,
[7006.06s -> 7013.14s]  it was a technical problem. So for the first three rooms, I was just like, oh, oh, fuck. I need to,
[7013.86s -> 7017.78s]  I need to pay close attention to everything going on because I have no direction in my ear.
[7017.78s -> 7029.85s]  So it was, there was an internal moment as we were starting that third kind of carousel scene
[7029.85s -> 7037.10s]  where I was just going, all right, man, this is a good luck because I don't know what's really
[7037.10s -> 7043.66s]  going on. I kind of just went in there and it was like, all right, I'm just going to have fun.
[7043.66s -> 7049.59s]  And that's exactly what it was. It was such a fun time to just put on that, those prosthetics.
[7053.74s -> 7061.21s]  I loved that. I loved every second of doing that. I think I even said to Rambo, I was like, oh man,
[7061.21s -> 7065.13s]  imagine, imagine we had like three more rooms to do. I feel like we were just, you know,
[7065.69s -> 7073.61s]  we were just getting right into it. Yeah, there's a point where Slimesicle, because I think Slimesicle
[7073.61s -> 7079.72s]  had direction in his ear. And there's a point where he's just like, hey, uh, don't, I mean,
[7079.72s -> 7084.52s]  if I was somebody picking, I think I would probably, you know, I may have, you know, maybe pick,
[7084.52s -> 7090.26s]  uh, pick her. And I was like, oh, what do you, yeah, that's really you. Is that what you,
[7090.34s -> 7103.93s]  is that what you think? Okay. All right. You. Oh yeah. I, Slimesicle saved my ass so bad.
[7103.93s -> 7108.73s]  I had absolutely no idea who, who got the audience poll. So I'm just sitting there going,
[7108.73s -> 7115.96s]  oh, okay. If you go back and watch it, I just, I just start stalling. I start stalling for time
[7116.52s -> 7121.74s]  because I just start doing duck, duck, goose. That is, that is the moment in the show when
[7121.74s -> 7127.34s]  you can know somebody got picked and I have no fucking idea who it is. I have not a single
[7127.34s -> 7135.56s]  solitary clue. So duck, uh, duck, I don't fucking know how I'm going to get through this one.
[7135.56s -> 7140.28s]  I don't know. I guess I was going to be like a weirdo with this prosthetics on and let me
[7140.28s -> 7156.52s]  walk around in a circle. Okay. I got this one. I know how to do it. We can put these back.
[7156.52s -> 7164.17s]  And that was, uh, uh, Valkyrae and Psychuno were the rats. They were a lot of fun to work with.
[7164.17s -> 7183.53s]  Valkyrae was super into that. It was awesome. Yeah. Super, super nice. They were really,
[7183.53s -> 7188.01s]  really cool. Just kind of hanging out and talking about random stuff. All right. How
[7188.01s -> 7197.94s]  do the, how are the rats going to act? Let's see. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it.
[7197.94s -> 7214.33s]  That's it right there. Now, come on, come on, come on, come on. This is a hook scenario, right?
[7227.91s -> 7234.73s]  What are your children's names? Yeah. Just, just walking up to Austin, just like, you know,
[7234.73s -> 7240.54s]  fluffing up his shirt a little, come here, you, let me, come here. What are your children's names?
[7240.54s -> 7251.88s]  It's just like, oh, fuck. Uh-oh. He is so goddamn fucking funny, by the way. I love
[7251.88s -> 7263.61s]  working with Austin. He is so fucking funny. Maybe I could just grab this one too. Let me,
[7263.61s -> 7270.89s]  let me try the grab. You know what I'm saying? The grab worked pretty well on the other one.
[7270.89s -> 7287.48s]  Why wouldn't it work well on this one? All right. We're getting somewhere. What about your runway
[7287.48s -> 7299.99s]  walk? Yeah. I've seen that pop up here and there. I love that cartoon villain shit, you know, going
[7299.99s -> 7303.75s]  into the, to the, the candy room, like that Willy Wonka inspired room being like, oh, hey,
[7303.75s -> 7307.67s]  can you hold this for a sec? Oh, the detonator and, and, you know, the, all the things that
[7307.67s -> 7314.86s]  you could get out with. I love the loony tunes bullshit. It's just, it just does it for me so
[7314.86s -> 7347.91s]  much. Is this going to do it? It needs to be really, really heavy shit with the walls flavored. I
[7347.91s -> 7356.66s]  don't, I don't think so. The goal with that room was to show people like, well, you do other shit
[7356.66s -> 7365.85s]  here. What do you, why? What? There was a bit that didn't get used that I really wanted to do,
[7365.85s -> 7371.02s]  but I guess there was just not enough time or not enough space or whatever. So here's what I
[7371.02s -> 7375.34s]  wanted to have happen. And it was, it was close to happening, but it just kind of didn't work.
[7375.34s -> 7382.10s]  When we were initially doing concept stuff, I thought it would have been funny if the,
[7382.10s -> 7385.30s]  so one of the rooms seems like a bit of room to room to room. Okay. We're in this room. Okay.
[7385.30s -> 7389.54s]  I made it out of this one. I'm on the next room. So take the party through the new room and they
[7389.54s -> 7395.22s]  open the door. Okay. What's the next one? What's the next weird saw inspired crazy puzzler weird
[7395.22s -> 7401.29s]  room. Right. And it's just a living room. It's just a regular living room with nothing weird.
[7401.29s -> 7405.69s]  And I just say, well, um, you know, I run an Airbnb out of here sometimes too. And actually
[7405.69s -> 7408.89s]  they're going to be here in about 20 minutes. So just, this is, there's nothing in here actually.
[7408.89s -> 7417.64s]  Just go to the next one and they just walk through it. And it's, it's a nice normal room,
[7417.64s -> 7432.30s]  but all that to just do one, like 15 to 22nd routine. Yeah, I get it. I think we need a folk
[7432.30s -> 7443.29s]  room or the other thing was, uh, it kind of started growing from there was what if there was just a
[7443.29s -> 7449.43s]  family in the room, like on vacation and show people like getting towels and like,
[7449.43s -> 7457.45s]  oh, we're going to the beach really soon here. Oh, we're right. We're like, as if we're getting
[7457.45s -> 7477.72s]  ready to like at the hotel, what is the cheesecake shit about? You want to know what the cheesecake
[7477.72s -> 7482.42s]  shit is about? What do you want me to tell you? Has Rambo talked about the cheesecake shit?
[7482.42s -> 7489.03s]  Has anybody talked about the cheesecake thing? Cause it was, it was literally not for anybody,
[7489.03s -> 7500.33s]  but for five people that were at dinner the night before. Okay. So they did. They have people have.
[7500.33s -> 7503.77s]  Okay. So let me, for those that have not heard the story, and I'm just going to do it really
[7503.77s -> 7508.01s]  quickly. Cause you may have heard it like three or four times already. So, and I'm not going to
[7508.01s -> 7513.74s]  play the game. So don't just relax. So at dinner, uh, there was a big dinner where there was, you
[7513.74s -> 7519.94s]  know, cast and crew. And we all kind of just went to dinner at this nice restaurant, right?
[7519.94s -> 7526.39s]  And one of the desserts was cheesecake. So one of the producers and they, we had a lot of people at
[7526.39s -> 7535.59s]  this table. So there had to have been at least, at least 15 plus people at this dinner. So at the
[7535.59s -> 7539.67s]  end, we got this big package where, okay, we have to feed all these people. We're doing a big group
[7539.67s -> 7544.74s]  thing. We got a bunch of desserts and it was probably like, Hey, I mean, it's 15, 20 people
[7544.74s -> 7548.98s]  sharing desserts. You have a bunch of different desserts. You've got like, I think we had like
[7548.98s -> 7555.99s]  eight to 10 cheesecake slices. They were just cheesecake everywhere. And one of the producers
[7555.99s -> 7560.87s]  kind of just looks over, we took a few bites. Oh, this is so good. Wow. It's so delicious.
[7560.87s -> 7567.26s]  And he kind of just looks over and he goes, wow, it's a bad day to be a cheesecake. And we were all
[7567.26s -> 7573.86s]  like, what the fuck was that? He's like, man, it's a bad day to be a cheesecake, isn't it?
[7573.86s -> 7583.50s]  And the whole kind of table is just like, it was like funny, but at the same time it was like,
[7583.50s -> 7587.18s]  all right, yeah, that's like, yeah. Cause it is kind of a bad day to be a cheesecake. Like
[7587.26s -> 7595.69s]  we're eating a fucking lot of them right now. And Nikki, who was sitting on the other side
[7595.69s -> 7604.82s]  of the table, she was laughing her ass off at this, just laughing her ass off. And we kept
[7604.82s -> 7611.14s]  saying it and kept kind of going over it. And at the table, we were kind of sitting around going,
[7611.14s -> 7618.31s]  all right, we know we're going to be on camera tomorrow. I'm going to do everything I can to
[7618.31s -> 7623.11s]  try to make as many people break on camera as possible. I'm going to say that tomorrow.
[7623.51s -> 7629.58s]  I'm going to find a way to say this. And people like, dude, please don't do that. You're going to
[7629.58s -> 7632.79s]  fuck up the whole show. You're going to ruin the whole show. Cause everyone's going to start
[7632.79s -> 7639.74s]  laughing. And it's that it's don't do that. Like should you do that? So I just like waiting for
[7639.74s -> 7646.22s]  the opportunity to be like, Oh, so you know that in joke that everybody's like, don't be careful.
[7646.78s -> 7650.86s]  Oh, I had pasta today. And that's how I told him I knew it was coming. The people knew it was
[7650.86s -> 7655.02s]  coming. The five or six, like seven people at that table knew it was coming when I started
[7655.02s -> 7663.72s]  talking about what I ate. So I'm like, Oh yeah. I felt pretty bloated after that. But for dessert.
[7663.72s -> 7673.80s]  Oh, let me just tell you it's a bad day to be a cheesecake. All right. Yeah. And that's the
[7673.80s -> 7687.18s]  fucking story. The goal was to try to make somebody just desperately fight with trying not to laugh
[7687.18s -> 7697.16s]  and fuck up that scene. It was, it was just like a good time. And you know, okay, you know,
[7697.16s -> 7702.84s]  whenever you do an event or a show or something, this is what, how I really believe and how I
[7702.84s -> 7707.66s]  really feel. No, like jokes are fucking around or anything right now. If people are having a good
[7707.66s -> 7714.76s]  time, then I feel like everything is better. The whole show from cast and crew. Everyone's like
[7714.76s -> 7718.84s]  actually having a great time. People like laughing. People are really into it. People have just,
[7718.84s -> 7722.76s]  you know, this is a fun time that we're all enjoying together. That's the most important
[7722.76s -> 7731.50s]  thing. And you look directly at Nikki as well. Yeah. I was going, I was like, okay, I, I know
[7731.50s -> 7740.22s]  you're, you're probably going to laugh. You're probably going to break. Um, I don't know. I
[7740.22s -> 7763.58s]  don't think I can do this one. What's this one? Make the robot sit on the chair. Wait, what? Can
[7763.58s -> 7806.07s]  it be my chair? How do I move this fast enough for, hold on. Should I push his legs? That's not going
[7806.07s -> 7828.92s]  to work. How do I make something happen here? I need a fulcrum. Big triangle. You mean for him
[7828.92s -> 7836.90s]  to sit on and get like launched? I'm not going to care about this right now. I'm just going to try
[7836.90s -> 7850.15s]  to figure out how to move this well. Okay. I don't have much time. I wish I could, there we go. It's
[7850.15s -> 7872.50s]  got to be much faster than that. How am I going to make that faster? Okay. Hold on. Wait, wait,
[7872.50s -> 7911.08s]  wait. This is hard. Can I just like box him in for a second? Okay. Upside down triangle behind
[7911.08s -> 7925.90s]  the chair and then push it forward. Yeah. But I'm upside down, but I feel I wanted to try it the
[7925.90s -> 7966.26s]  right way. How do you do this fast enough before he sits down? That's close. Go. It's not heavy
[7966.26s -> 8003.94s]  enough. It's not heavy enough. This is very, very hard. Wider, wider. I can't go much wider.
[8003.94s -> 8014.86s]  Otherwise it'll just hit the top and not do anything. It's close. Can I like weigh it down?
[8014.86s -> 8057.77s]  I think this is still possible from here. Block the guy's ass. I thought I tried last time,
[8057.77s -> 8084.06s]  but he's kind of just, hmm. He weighs too much. That doesn't help. You need to move the chair to
[8084.06s -> 8095.10s]  the guy. No, I don't. What are you talking about? There's nothing. I can't make anything weigh fast.
[8095.10s -> 8099.46s]  I can't, nothing can weigh enough before he's sitting down. See what I mean? Like I could make
[8099.46s -> 8123.51s]  it heavier, but you have to do it instantly. Like, can I like just box him in for now? I can't
[8123.51s -> 8154.07s]  unless it's, I didn't, what the hell did that do? I wonder if I can, no, you can't just slide back.
[8154.07s -> 8170.26s]  I don't get it. Like the sumo wrestler touched the ground? You had it? It's a pain in the ass. I
[8170.26s -> 8173.94s]  don't want to do it. I don't like being, I don't like time limits like that. Let me just do it.
[8173.94s -> 8177.85s]  I don't want a time limit. I don't want a one second time limit. I mean, I want to be able
[8177.85s -> 8197.35s]  to do it at my own pace. I don't want a one and a half second time limit. Oh, this is going to be
[8197.35s -> 8205.06s]  fucking hell. Okay. So I kind of need to just go like this, but it needs to weigh. Well, actually
[8205.06s -> 8214.79s]  this won't be that bad. Just make it really heavy. You got to touch the ground though. So that
[8214.79s -> 8328.46s]  actually might, close. Oh, nice turd. It's not heavy enough. Touch the ground. This weighs a
[8328.46s -> 8359.37s]  million pounds. You're saying make a big M or big W? What do you mean? Like how would a W work?
[8359.37s -> 8366.50s]  Weigh it down, then draw more above it. Let's go with, or are we going to go with the claw technique?
[8366.50s -> 8404.14s]  Hook technique is good. Keeps steady. This thing just needs to weigh a shitload. We're just going
[8404.14s -> 8428.57s]  to squish. Do you know what I mean? Just weigh this whole thing down. If this doesn't work, I,
[8428.57s -> 8453.19s]  I don't know what I have to do to get it to be perfect. All right, you ready? Let's let it go.
[8453.19s -> 8478.31s]  I didn't know this was part of the universe. The hand is part of the universe. Right. Make sure it
[8478.31s -> 8490.06s]  doesn't grab because it'll hook on. I like, they like this music. What is it? Is it still Club Penguin?
[8490.06s -> 8511.91s]  I like it. I should put on, I want to put on Smash Brothers music. You know, the one that goes,
[8515.11s -> 8530.14s]  it's actually getting stuck on the, this is actually the way to do it too. I just keep having to get
[8530.14s -> 8559.48s]  caught on stuff. I'm an idiot. Like an idiot. Don't go too close to the edge because it'll get stuck.
[8559.48s -> 8595.11s]  How do I, nothing is heavy enough. Nothing's heavy enough. It needs velocity. Put it up higher. I,
[8595.11s -> 8608.46s]  I can't. There's a hand in the way. I cannot do anything here. So the highest I can drop this from
[8608.46s -> 8682.71s]  is right here. Go from the ground up. How does that work? That's kind of close. Get it. I mean,
[8682.71s -> 8694.82s]  I could, I could sit here and grab this all day, but that's just not going to happen. That's what
[8694.82s -> 8713.45s]  I wanted to do in the beginning. All right. All right. Hold on. Hold on. Kind of was doing it.
[8713.45s -> 8744.60s]  Come on, do it. Is there a refund timer going? I'm way past that. All right. Let me think if I were
[8744.60s -> 8754.71s]  to, it needs to go boom, boom. So I mean, once you start drawing, it just drops. So there's,
[8754.71s -> 8759.40s]  I wish I could freeze stuff. I wish I could like hold something here, but I can't. So it has to,
[8759.40s -> 8768.39s]  when you start a drawing, you got to go from the ground up. So like, what if I do this?
[8768.39s -> 8776.63s]  Like just block it so it can only go to this area here and then just knock it somehow. And what if
[8776.63s -> 8781.54s]  I just drop a, what if I just dropped this on here? Like just go poink. Not going to help.
[8784.01s -> 8802.49s]  We can't hear the music again. Right there. I mean, I just, I just don't, I, I don't know.
[8802.49s -> 8823.58s]  There's no dodge roll in this game. I can't play it. Um, what is this? Make the balloon touch the
[8823.58s -> 8852.87s]  left wall. I think that's what they want me to do. Maybe just little bits. I hate this game and I'm
[8852.87s -> 8864.06s]  not even playing it. We're fine. Make the balls touch the red areas. These have to spin. Let's
[8864.06s -> 8872.65s]  just see what happens if I go right in the middle. Well, that's how you get it done.
[8872.65s -> 8887.62s]  Give the girl the balloon. Oh, you mean a crusher with a rock. Oops. Uh, can I,
[8887.62s -> 8934.76s]  I can't put anything in here. Oh, I can. Oh, I did it. What's going on? Pick, touch,
[8934.76s -> 8948.09s]  pick up the balloon. What's happening? What is going on? What, what the hell was that?
[8948.09s -> 9001.00s]  Why won't you stay? Stay. There we go. All right. Make the ball touch both red areas.
[9001.51s -> 9019.90s]  Ex, excuse me. Somebody said lower the game volume. Is it allowed? Make the ball touch both.
[9019.90s -> 9069.27s]  Excuse me. Looks like it's time for a fulcrum. That's right. Good call.
[9084.10s -> 9108.78s]  I'm fine. I'm in trouble. I'm in trouble. How do I get this to bounce? There it is.
[9108.78s -> 9131.24s]  Do that quick thinking right there. Make the balloons fly away. Just wait probably, right?
[9131.24s -> 9146.71s]  I imagine it's probably something like that. Yeah, there it goes. This game is addicting.
[9146.71s -> 9187.69s]  Release the balloon. Make the red ball touch the left wall. Why does it keep saying red?
[9187.69s -> 9203.56s]  Nice fulcrum, bro. I got it. Okay. Pull the bottle cap out. Easy. That's when I got this one done.
[9203.56s -> 9232.49s]  This one's in completely cashed. I didn't know the bottle was going to fall. Study this guy's brain.
[9232.49s -> 9242.01s]  Someone's trying to beat you in a race of the game. I'm not racing anybody. I'm playing
[9242.01s -> 9252.65s]  casually on my own time. This does not say, Hey, there's a, I'm, I'm racing right now. Red ball.
[9252.73s -> 9283.30s]  Okay. I got an idea with this one. Have your thirties been better than your twenties?
[9283.30s -> 9292.49s]  Um, that's a good question because I feel like in your twenties, you're kind of figuring out
[9292.49s -> 9301.82s]  who you are. And in your thirties, you kind of know who that is. I got an idea here. Hold on.
[9301.82s -> 9308.38s]  Watch this. Ready? This is going to be like a golf club. That's the right idea. Hold on.
[9308.38s -> 9323.98s]  Well, that was dumb. I think the rock has to be bigger and then this has to go all the way.
[9323.98s -> 9364.50s]  And then that's it right there. Keep pulling it. Close. Yeah. I mean, I honestly, I feel like since
[9364.50s -> 9374.04s]  I turned say like 35 or so, you kind of, I kind of just know exactly what I'm, what I want to do
[9374.04s -> 9379.56s]  and who that person is and who I am. In your twenties, you're really kind of still figuring
[9379.56s -> 9386.73s]  out like, Hey, what exactly am I doing with myself? I've said this before. It's, it's not a race. So
[9386.73s -> 9393.58s]  I know a lot of people in this channel are in their twenties. Um, it's not a race. Don't think
[9393.58s -> 9400.79s]  it is. I didn't figure out shit until I was well into my late twenties, early thirties. And still,
[9400.79s -> 9404.49s]  I'm still figuring out. I mean, look, I don't know how to do the f*****g Thagorean theorem here.
[9404.49s -> 9436.22s]  That's it right there. Oh, this needs to be so much heavier. Yeah. Maybe it's too heavy.
[9436.22s -> 9451.69s]  Maybe this needs to be heavier. Wait a minute. Hold on. Watch this. Now, theoretically,
[9451.69s -> 9519.11s]  I don't have a theory at all. S**t. S**t. It's right there. God damn it. Do it already. All right.
[9519.11s -> 9524.22s]  That pulls it. I think I got it. I think that's the one. I remember what that looks like.
[9529.18s -> 9543.24s]  Go like this up right here and then that here and then boot it. I think that's it. It wasn't,
[9543.24s -> 9566.17s]  that's too long, but all right. That's the right idea. S**t. Still too long. Have a big exam next
[9566.17s -> 9577.06s]  week. Wish me luck. I studied. Good luck. I've learned since the last time somebody said little
[9577.06s -> 9582.66s]  bro can't just say good luck to somebody. He has to go on a 15 minute rant about like pot pies and
[9582.66s -> 9599.18s]  stuff. I heard it. So I'm, I'm doing it differently now. F**k. It needs to be like a bend. I don't know
[9599.18s -> 9607.02s]  anything about this. We all do different things. Okay. If you're like, Oh, I know how to do this and
[9607.02s -> 9633.21s]  do that. That's good. I'm glad you know how to do it. I'm a tinkerer. There's a difference. You want
[9633.21s -> 9638.57s]  the thing to fall to the right, but keep building it up against the right wall. Dude. I know this
[9638.57s -> 9653.37s]  just at the zoo right now. I need to like bend it. I don't know. Move the ball first. I mean,
[9653.37s -> 9738.92s]  I guess I could move the ball first. Oh my God. No, stop. Move. Finish breath of the wild. Do you
[9738.92s -> 9742.36s]  suck at this game? You just added it three more weeks to when I'm going to play breath of the
[9742.36s -> 9798.50s]  wild. Remember that I need to remember this exact thing that I just did. I already forgot it. I
[9798.50s -> 9822.81s]  forgot it already. I wasn't even paying attention. Object permanence. I just not burning anything into
[9822.81s -> 9829.66s]  short term memory because I'm about to put a hole through my monitor. It's really hard before,
[9829.66s -> 9833.74s]  you know, before you like, you know, put your head, but the monitor, it's hard to be like,
[9833.74s -> 9853.13s]  Oh yeah. I like just like pay attention more. Why don't you ever headbutt a monitor? Oh,
[9853.13s -> 9859.86s]  I can't believe I'm up against. I'm up against. Oh, what's the character from League of Legends?
[9859.86s -> 9873.77s]  I can't even name one rise. What's his name? Oh shit. What's the, what's the, what's the
[9873.77s -> 9884.97s]  character's name? Oh yeah. It is rise. Oh fuck. I'm going against rise mid. Fuck dude. It's over.
[9884.97s -> 9919.99s]  I'm going to lose. Not from the music. All right. First of all, do this first.
[9919.99s -> 9931.45s]  I had it. Then it's like here and then like dip. And then I did this. I think that's what I did.
[9931.45s -> 9937.86s]  Did I not do it like that? That was a career ending joke. I've done like a thousand of those.
[9938.58s -> 9958.41s]  So I don't think so. I wish I could draw more than once and not have everything just start to move
[9958.41s -> 9962.01s]  when I'm done painting. I wish it was a button I could press that was like, okay, start the physics
[9962.01s -> 9988.10s]  now. I don't care. You can't have everything. Have your brother Dave do it for you. I would bet
[9988.10s -> 9992.60s]  that half of you guys wouldn't be able to do even a third of the ones that I'm doing. Is that,
[9992.60s -> 9996.68s]  do you think that's correct? I would bet that. I bet a third of the people there probably couldn't
[9996.68s -> 10011.66s]  do even half of these. What do you think? Are this a third? Do you think 30% of 20,000 people?
[10011.66s -> 10018.63s]  Probably a few thousand, right? And who cares? All right. Let's release. Let's do that. I got
[10018.63s -> 10047.21s]  an idea already. You know what's going on. He's free. Okay. Let's put on pizza. Pizza.
[10051.66s -> 10065.74s]  Pizza tower. Why not? Hook the balloon on the dot. Hmm. Well, how the heck do I do that?
[10065.74s -> 10087.30s]  This is a great soundtrack. Yeah, there it is. Turn it up. It can be kind of low.
[10087.30s -> 10093.96s]  Doesn't have to be super loud. What the hell is that? I lost everything. I lost my chat.
[10101.18s -> 10107.10s]  There we go. Does anybody know how to turn off that feature of windows, which I don't,
[10107.10s -> 10114.06s]  I don't understand why it was ever implemented. You ever have like, I've got like eight windows open
[10114.95s -> 10120.31s]  and then like I for some reason clicked and dragged and moved to a spot on one of the monitors
[10120.95s -> 10128.50s]  that just minimizes every fucking single window. What, what were they doing when they made that a
[10128.50s -> 10134.23s]  thing? Oh, Hey, I'm just like moving a wind. I'm moving one of my windows. Uh, maybe a little too
[10134.23s -> 10145.45s]  close to the stop. Just minimize every single window you were working on. Oh, this is a good
[10145.45s -> 10190.60s]  idea. No, I didn't want to let go. Whoops. I've skirted out. I want to freeze it here because
[10190.60s -> 10203.66s]  when I let go, it's just everything falls. Actually, this is probably the way to do it.
[10203.66s -> 10233.21s]  Now I have to turn it on first. Why would you get stuck here? Of all places, you were just moving
[10233.21s -> 10274.62s]  up the line. What stopped you? That, well, I thought, okay, it has to stay on there. Oh,
[10274.62s -> 10287.10s]  this is going to be fucking hard. This actually will be very difficult. Oh man. Okay. How tall is
[10287.10s -> 10317.38s]  this? I'm trying to make it so it doesn't fly away. Okay. Can I do anything now that I did this? The
[10317.38s -> 10348.94s]  hook has collision. I mean, the goal now is I'm trying to like that. Oh, do it already. It's too
[10348.94s -> 10376.73s]  low. I think it should get it right there. Latch, latch. Oh, no, it's too low. You're right. Damn it.
[10376.73s -> 10403.93s]  Okay. All right. We're good. Now I got to figure out how to just knock it this way. You fucking
[10403.93s -> 10425.98s]  idiot. You idiot. You idiot. I've uninstalled games for fewer less than this. That's why I
[10425.98s -> 10445.88s]  want to let you know. It's in the right spot. Should I just like make a, just go like this
[10445.88s -> 10483.21s]  and like drag it this way? No. Wait, it's going, it's going. Shit. It's right here. Come on. Oh my
[10483.21s -> 10498.22s]  God. Fucking asshole. Get on there. Dude, I look, there is plenty of space. This is absolute
[10498.22s -> 10518.02s]  bullshit. Why can I not draw here? It's fucking me up. Big time. I'm going to get this. It's so
[10518.02s -> 10533.24s]  close. It's right here. This hurts to watch. This hurts to play. Just in case you're wondering.
[10533.24s -> 10562.50s]  Shit. No, I want it to stay there. Actually might work out. You can solve this with one line.
[10562.50s -> 10568.47s]  You're talking about like, do this. You have to activate it and then go like this. So it floats
[10568.47s -> 10574.20s]  over and gets hooked on it. But the problem is the balloon doesn't want to move anymore.
[10574.20s -> 10591.46s]  Do a ramp with a hook. Have it go through the string. I mean like this. So we'll drag it up.
[10591.46s -> 10599.13s]  No. Stir beat every level. You're going to let him win. Stir did not beat 1200 levels.
[10600.84s -> 10619.96s]  I stir probably played this for 20 minutes and then just left and moved on. I'm going to duck.
[10619.96s -> 10661.30s]  All that matters. I don't care. Oh, that moves. Okay. Hold on. I quit. I'm taking the IQ test
[10661.30s -> 10685.45s]  instead. Use the mouse to draw shapes. Click on the, don't judge me based on what you're about to
[10685.45s -> 10696.26s]  see because it's not fair. It's actually completely, it's going to be completely unfair. Okay. Click
[10696.26s -> 10704.70s]  on the IQ icon for a comprehensive diagnosis. It is recommended that as many of the 20 tasks
[10704.70s -> 10711.06s]  be completed as possible. Okay. All right. Put your drawing into the beaker. You cannot draw
[10711.06s -> 10745.90s]  in the blue area. Okay. So we're going to make a, we're going to make like a bridge. Oh, I was
[10745.90s -> 10751.05s]  trying to, can I restart it? Cause I was trying, I was, I was, I was trying to make it. I, this is
[10751.05s -> 10761.61s]  why I want, I wish I could just fucking like, you know what I was trying to do here? That's what I
[10761.61s -> 10776.49s]  was trying to do, but like I, it fucked up. Get in there. All right. There it is. I, I, this should
[10776.49s -> 10788.50s]  have been two tries. Make the red ball touch the red area. Let me think about this for a second
[10788.58s -> 10799.94s]  before everybody screams. You got an 80. That's 80 IQ. No, no, that's, we have to wait for the
[10799.94s -> 10807.66s]  assessment. By the way, you're taking time away from my IQ test. I need to touch the red area.
[10807.66s -> 10822.55s]  Okay. Oh, I thought this thing just saying I was an idiot. All right. So let's think about it.
[10822.55s -> 10831.67s]  I'm going to have to knock this forward. It is not to go in here. It's to go here. So let's start
[10832.12s -> 10848.70s]  by going like this. It's got to be steep enough where it can make it like that. Okay. I also need
[10848.70s -> 10884.66s]  to go. I need a ramp here. So it goes, I think that should do it. Like, you know what I was going for
[10884.66s -> 10891.62s]  that is my, is my IQ bad because drawing with a mouse sucks. No, that's not intelligence. That's
[10891.62s -> 10912.97s]  drawing with a mouse sucks. You might get there. You've had practice though, two hours of practice.
[10912.97s -> 10919.42s]  You need to do 10,000 hours of something to be a fucking good at it. I'm not even close to being
[10919.42s -> 10943.98s]  there. Here we go. How was that better than the first one? Draw something and touch the red area.
[10943.98s -> 10978.78s]  Okay. So it's got a drop over here. So it's going to make a, like a little tower, right? There we go.
[10978.78s -> 11035.00s]  What's that? 130 IQ. What's yours? Make the red square touch the left wall. Come on. I didn't mean
[11035.00s -> 11097.69s]  to do that. I, how do I, that's what the fulcrum was. I would have had it this one. I'm going to
[11097.69s -> 11123.00s]  get like two IQ on this one. I didn't, why did I even make that thing? Fucking smash this thing.
[11123.00s -> 11171.48s]  Push it all the way. Come on. What did I get? That's fine. I'm not doing my IQ assessment yet.
[11171.48s -> 11199.10s]  Go already. I did this one first try before. Shit. 130. Red ball, touch the red area. Watch this.
[11199.10s -> 11212.73s]  First try. Whoa. I forgot that it doesn't stay. That's my fault for not remembering. I think I
[11212.73s -> 11275.18s]  still might be all right. Play Street Fighter. Um, no, I fucked it up. That's too big. That's
[11275.18s -> 11292.89s]  got to be it. Hey, 110 IQ. Get out of here. Draw something and touch the red area. Oh,
[11292.89s -> 11311.94s]  I see what's going on here. Uh, I don't got it. Oh, not like this. What do you think I was doing?
[11311.94s -> 11318.97s]  I made the T specifically for that. Have only one snowflake in the container. Um, we, I didn't know
[11318.97s -> 11335.74s]  that's what you, whoa. I think I just got it. Oh, come on. Get over there. Oh, 170 IQ. Lower the
[11335.74s -> 11381.53s]  coat hanger. Retry. Where are the fulcrums? I don't need them right now. I'm fine as we are.
[11381.53s -> 11403.05s]  Lower the coat hanger. All right. So I wanted, I needed to spin this way. I got an idea. Really?
[11403.05s -> 11449.29s]  The momentum is not going to work. I think I hate him. You wouldn't do this in the, you would not
[11449.29s -> 11453.85s]  do this in the amount of time I'm doing it. You wouldn't do this. You wouldn't do this in the same
[11453.85s -> 11458.65s]  amount of time. You wouldn't do it. You wouldn't be able to do it in the same amount of time.
[11458.73s -> 11506.30s]  You wouldn't do it. You wouldn't be able to do it. Get off, dude. Are you kidding me?
[11506.30s -> 11522.74s]  There are engineers and architects in chat. Unlatch it. That's technically unlatched.
[11522.74s -> 11530.90s]  There it is. There actually might be. That was 130. That one was a hard one.
[11530.90s -> 11543.10s]  The yellow ball will start moving when something touches it. Put the balls in the cup.
[11543.10s -> 11620.76s]  Salvageable. Oh my God. What the fuck? Are you trolling, dude? I don't, do you really think I
[11620.76s -> 11626.58s]  would be able to do that if I tried? If I really tried, do you think I would be able to put pixel
[11626.58s -> 11651.42s]  perfect capture that ball where it was? Stop trolling, dude. Two lines, dude. I'm begging you.
[11651.42s -> 11659.74s]  I got it right here. See, I didn't know. Okay. I didn't know they had collision. I thought that
[11659.74s -> 11664.33s]  they could go through each other. I did it. And that one was a hundred IQ. So I'll take the
[11664.33s -> 11671.40s]  complaints. Throw Alex up 10 meters. I know how to do that. I did it accidentally like five times
[11671.40s -> 11704.73s]  already. I guess that's 25 meters. I got, that's not even 20 IQ. What? How was it? That's a worse
[11704.73s -> 11739.05s]  one so far. Take the ball out. Play new music. The music's playing right now. You can definitely
[11739.05s -> 11765.18s]  hear it. I'm almost done with my IQ test. This will be it right here. 120. Almost done. Don't
[11765.18s -> 11833.18s]  let the cup touch the ground. What cup? Don't let the cup touch the ground. Oh, I have to turn this
[11833.18s -> 11949.46s]  up. Okay.
[12000.14s -> 12065.38s]  Let's go. Come on. Does that work? There it is. Make the beaker touch the red area. You know what
[12065.38s -> 12103.66s]  we're doing. You know what we're doing. You ready? Shit. Oh, he's fucking laughing. That's like,
[12104.22s -> 12145.93s]  dude, your fulcrum sucks. Hey, leave my fulcrum alone. There we go. This is it. Yeah. Yeah.
[12165.98s -> 12232.68s]  Oh, come on. Really? Oh, 40, 40. This thing is heavy. This thing is heavy.
[12233.24s -> 12252.49s]  Bang. Got to place the ball on the other side of the. Okay. Check this out.
[12370.60s -> 12390.28s]  I have to like whack it over there. You're the most interesting mind in the world.
[12390.28s -> 12396.30s]  I have to whack it through here. You need a fucking fulcrum already.
[12396.30s -> 12403.54s]  Don't tell me when I do and do not need to fulcrum. Hey, this is a conversation between
[12404.44s -> 12409.08s]  A and B you're talking. Seize the next letter and fucking get out of here.
[12409.08s -> 12439.94s]  You know what I'm saying? I keep winning apparently. What do I keep winning? Okay.
[12439.94s -> 12470.63s]  I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing this for.
[12470.63s -> 12476.23s]  I was trying to make a ceiling to fuck. I don't know why I made this.
[12489.35s -> 12492.07s]  Ceiling for what? So it didn't launch? I don't know. To guide it.
[12494.50s -> 12497.38s]  You literally had the idea. The right idea for the wrong side.
[12498.82s -> 12532.14s]  I get a good fulcrum here. Why do you keep doing that? I don't know how you get this ball to go
[12532.14s -> 12540.39s]  in this hole. You know, it would be okay. Let it do it. Go. It's the line's too thick. I mean,
[12540.39s -> 12577.22s]  I don't know. I have to like get it to hit this way. How big does this gotta be better than that?
[12577.22s -> 12581.46s]  Catapult, catapult, catapult. Yeah, I know. So it has to be launched from this side.
[12581.46s -> 12591.50s]  But how the fuck? You can make it with one line. The line is the fulcrum.
[12593.10s -> 12595.90s]  Don't let these clowns bully you. Just do your best.
[12596.62s -> 12602.14s]  If they were still VIPs, I would VIP you for five. You know what I mean? All right.
[12602.94s -> 12610.62s]  So it needs to, the ball needs to fall here and needs to launch from this side that way.
[12611.26s -> 12615.67s]  That's gonna be such a, this is gonna be impossible. Just make a half pipe.
[12622.60s -> 12639.26s]  That didn't even want it to go that way. I don't think this is ever gonna work like this.
[12640.06s -> 12713.69s]  Maybe like support beams. I'll just make a hook at some point, right? Oh, what? That actually kind of
[12713.69s -> 12778.97s]  worked. Fall that way. The weight is on the right side. There's no weight over here. Look at how
[12778.97s -> 12785.21s]  heavy this fucking thing is. I don't know anything about leverage. Because I don't even know how to
[12785.21s -> 12802.39s]  change a tire. I have no idea how to do that. Guess what? None of you do either. None of us do.
[12805.14s -> 12818.81s]  It's a, that's a big problem, isn't it? The best part about this is if I can't do something,
[12818.81s -> 12834.57s]  just say everybody else can either. That's how I get, how I feel better. This is the kind of
[12834.57s -> 12840.47s]  shit that you go to like school for eight years to do all this. So you can fucking figure out this
[12840.47s -> 12869.80s]  puzzle correctly. It's closer. How is this not weigh so much more? Like the weight thing,
[12869.80s -> 12879.96s]  I don't understand. I made a ball and it does, it's not heavy. This ball is fucking massive.
[12879.96s -> 12899.29s]  How is this not pulling down so hard? Get in there. Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me.
[12899.85s -> 12924.20s]  I can bump it in there, can't I? Yes. Make the ball touch the left wall. Uh, okay. Seems kind
[12924.20s -> 12966.63s]  of easy. Thought this would be kind of a hard one. Okay. Hold on. So I have to touch this. I guess I
[12966.63s -> 12969.75s]  could just touch it with something that never hits the ground over here. So I go like this,
[12970.55s -> 12978.46s]  but it's not like this is going to be a big, right? Like who cares? Well, I had it just hook this,
[12979.26s -> 13012.57s]  have it go like this. Is it going to stand? All right. Wait a second. What are you doing?
[13012.57s -> 13032.44s]  I'm listening to pizza tower. What happens if I fill this? What will this do? I just want to see
[13032.44s -> 13049.45s]  what happens. Okay. So you're only 18 in, in three and a half hours, bro. This is like the
[13049.45s -> 13071.83s]  fourth game mode I've played. You got to go back and watch the fog. Okay. Hold on a second.
[13072.39s -> 13103.96s]  How's this for some fucking IQ? How's that for a little bit of IQ? How's that going to work?
[13105.78s -> 13147.24s]  Two more. That did not work. I forgot it falls. Um, I have to like, okay. So here's the weird part.
[13147.88s -> 13153.48s]  I have to activate it first because it won't pull it when I, uh, I have to turn it on first.
[13154.20s -> 13177.72s]  I can do that. I mean, could I effectively just put balls in here and pump it that way? Okay. So
[13177.72s -> 13186.46s]  I got an idea. We're just, we're just hooking for a second. Hold on. I said that needs to go the
[13186.46s -> 13233.88s]  other way. Okay. Got to go all the way around. Boom. Shit. Right idea, but the wrong placement.
[13236.81s -> 13246.49s]  I almost think I could make a ramp. I go, what if I go like this and then what if I go like that
[13248.30s -> 13272.78s]  then like this? Nevermind. Actually might help. Hold on a minute. Not at all. So how do I get
[13272.78s -> 13282.65s]  this to spin completely almost 180 degrees this way or this way? Well, I can't, it's not going
[13282.65s -> 13299.42s]  to be able to ever go this way. So it has to go flip to the left. It has to wait a minute. Okay.
[13299.42s -> 13340.50s]  Hold on. Okay. That's kind of cheating, but that kind of works. Oh, we're almost there. Look now.
[13340.50s -> 13373.70s]  I just have to go like that and it's gotta be like harsher. It's gotta be like a sharp point,
[13373.70s -> 13407.61s]  maybe lower. There it is. Let's knock it this way and I'm done. It'll bounce back. It'll bounce back.
[13407.61s -> 13430.15s]  Ah, all right. Now we just wait. He didn't read chat. Surely the chat, but I was just talking to
[13430.15s -> 13447.91s]  my mom. I know this is bad. This is salvageable. Okay. Now we just have to pull it back this way
[13447.91s -> 13501.78s]  and it should be good. You know what we're doing. It's definitely high enough where I can. No,
[13501.78s -> 13520.94s]  I can't. All right. Now cut the shit and just move it. Just pull it this way. Grab this and hook it
[13520.94s -> 13540.09s]  over here. Finally. Now just move that. Oh, this'll do it. All right. This is the last one. And then
[13540.09s -> 13632.44s]  we'll see what my actual IQ is. Wolfram Frank. This is it. This is going to be it right here.
[13632.44s -> 13711.13s]  Check it out. This is it. Just flip it. That's what I was trying to do.
[13711.13s -> 13824.73s]  I think it's close enough. There it is. All right. Let's go. So I'm there. I'm right there.
[13824.73s -> 13851.38s]  This is an AI learning program. Yeah. And guess what? That AI does this shit like 50 million times
[13851.38s -> 13866.23s]  before it understands it. Dude, you're poisoning the data right now. I'm fine. I just, I don't,
[13866.31s -> 13873.59s]  I don't know. Anytime, anytime the word pulley lever or hook is in the conversation,
[13874.31s -> 13879.05s]  I'm talking about Star Wars with three or four other people in the room. You know what I'm saying?
[13880.39s -> 13889.00s]  Like I very much enjoy gardening. You know what I mean? I like a garden. I can tell you about
[13889.00s -> 13898.78s]  gardening. Fertilize, how to fertilize. Well, I don't, I don't know about pulleys. I don't know
[13898.78s -> 13907.27s]  about weight distributions, forklift things. I don't know that. That's a skill. That's a skill.
[13907.67s -> 13920.97s]  That's a really, that's a skill that you have to learn. What is the perfect pH value in water
[13920.97s -> 13926.47s]  for cannabis plants? I don't grow cannabis, but I can't answer that question. Nice. Gotcha though.
[13927.03s -> 13974.76s]  All right. We're doing it my way. I really expect us to believe you just grow in sunflowers and
[13974.76s -> 13986.28s]  never delved into the devil's plant. Um, I like marijuana. I don't grow marijuana. How do I,
[13986.28s -> 13993.00s]  how do I get out of here? How do I figure this out? I can't figure out how to do all the shit to
[13993.00s -> 14000.94s]  twist and pull and grab and what about like this? This is stupid. It's like a dumb idea.
[14007.22s -> 14018.82s]  What if I just do this and then drop a ball here and just flip it? Does that work? It grips it
[14018.82s -> 14024.26s]  correctly. Theoretically should. I think radically. My hypothesis is this looks like it's going pretty
[14024.26s -> 14108.50s]  well. Okay. Deduction. Deduced. Pick it up with your hand. Let's do some sess with focrums. Um,
[14110.73s -> 14117.14s]  I did this one before. I don't, it's like grabbing it, having it be like up, left,
[14117.14s -> 14123.46s]  down, up, weight, counterweight, counterweight this way. No, I don't, I don't, I have no idea.
[14124.02s -> 14155.13s]  I just want to just tip it, but it won't do it because I'm trying to make a hook,
[14155.13s -> 14161.05s]  but eventually it's too big because I can only draw a certain size. All right. Well, hold on.
[14161.69s -> 14181.91s]  Is it now possible for me to pull this and I just whack this now? This is it. This has to be it.
[14188.92s -> 14218.95s]  Everybody say a prayer because this is it. This is question 20. Fuck you. Ha, you can't make it
[14218.95s -> 14252.25s]  small enough for it to dip. Dip the shit. I didn't, I didn't even mean to do it, but I just solved it.
[14252.25s -> 14278.31s]  I just made a makeshift fulcrum. I didn't even mean to solve it. I don't know. Okay. What about
[14278.31s -> 14315.16s]  this? Like, no, I wish I could just change how big the painter is. All right. What the fuck?
[14315.16s -> 14323.42s]  Why is your chat so toxic? Um, I don't, are you guys toxic? Yes or no. This is a yes or no question.
[14325.05s -> 14329.13s]  Are you guys toxic? Yes or no. And I want you to be honest.
[14330.68s -> 14338.81s]  Knows you saying yes. Work on that. Work on that. I ain't going to say it again. Work on that.
[14339.37s -> 14354.98s]  It kind of looks like a nose. Okay. So what a big stick in a box at the end.
[14355.70s -> 14372.63s]  That might work. Work on being even more toxic. Now you got me angry. I've been hanging out,
[14372.63s -> 14377.11s]  just chilling, playing this game. Now you've really, really pissed me off. Are you ready?
[14377.91s -> 14409.69s]  I'm going to beat this on the next try because of that. I just, I just don't get it. I know a lot of
[14409.69s -> 14416.52s]  people will probably get it. And they're like, dude, I get it. I don't get it. I would get it
[14416.52s -> 14433.14s]  if I could shrink the paint brush. I don't get it. Have you seen the new butt hole emoji? No,
[14433.14s -> 14480.17s]  I haven't. I hope it makes you happy. You do you. How do I do this? Actually, I'm like completely
[14480.17s -> 14486.89s]  stumped. I don't, I don't, I don't get how you can make a hook that can pull it down without
[14486.89s -> 14497.02s]  hitting the ground and have it go all the way over. I guess that's kind of correct. Maybe just
[14497.02s -> 14518.14s]  hold on and try that again. It's too big. Everything's too big. I can't make it smaller.
[14518.78s -> 14542.60s]  If I could make the hook part smaller, it's kind of correct. What if I, is this a stupid idea?
[14543.32s -> 14560.90s]  Kind of. Go the other way with the weight facing the other side. I don't know how far out I should
[14560.90s -> 14574.17s]  go. How far should I do it? Oh, that's kind of an idea. It's not a bad idea. I think I'll get it
[14574.17s -> 14615.42s]  doing this. Is that enough space? Oh, it's almost like it needs that gap there. It's close. It's so
[14615.42s -> 14656.82s]  close, but it's not going to do it. Can I just bump it? I'm going back to this. This is like a brace
[14656.82s -> 14678.18s]  for it and then maybe it'll just flip over. Wait, fulcrum, left side fulcrum. I need to lift the
[14678.18s -> 14696.54s]  left one. What if I do it thin? Look at how thin that is. All right. All right. You got a thin crust
[14696.54s -> 14701.32s]  or thicker crust for pizza. Get them distracted so they stop, you know, making fun of me.
[14701.32s -> 14733.90s]  Okay. And now let's really get at some momentum. Go. Oh my God. There it is. I don't want to freak
[14733.90s -> 14760.50s]  out, but I think I'm in trouble. I kind of need to hit it again. Yes. It was correct. All right.
[14760.50s -> 14792.66s]  It's time to get the results. My IQ is, you ready? What's the song I need? What's this? What's the
[14792.66s -> 14798.10s]  song? I'm going to drag this out. What's the song when Saitama is going to punch somebody
[14798.10s -> 14799.30s]  in One Punch Man and it goes,
[14804.66s -> 14814.02s]  what's it called? I'm going to do the thing where I play an epic song and reveal it. What's it called?
[14814.02s -> 14839.66s]  Saitama's theme. Is this it? I don't hear anything. I don't hear it. I don't hear anything.
[14839.66s -> 14857.67s]  That's weird. Do you think it's over or under a hundred? Oh, there we go. Now I can hear.
[14857.67s -> 14862.07s]  All right. Is it over or under a hundred? You guys ready? Here comes the epic thing.
[14862.07s -> 14879.93s]  So I took an IQ test today and it made me understand that it doesn't matter if you're good
[14879.93s -> 14882.81s]  at puzzles. It doesn't matter if you can dodge a battle X. It doesn't matter if you can fight
[14882.81s -> 14893.58s]  anybody. We're all strong inside. We all have what it takes. Whatever is underneath this,
[14893.58s -> 14897.42s]  it doesn't matter what it is. It could be 50. It could be a hundred. It could be 150,
[14897.42s -> 14903.02s]  which would make me better than all of you. Way better. But even if it does say that,
[14903.66s -> 14911.62s]  it could be 20, but it's not going to be. It's time to reveal the IQ. And again,
[14911.62s -> 14937.94s]  don't be discouraged when you see this number. Really? All right. I'll take it.
[14939.37s -> 14952.66s]  That's better than average. Nice radio station. That's my name. Well, it was under a hundred.
[14954.38s -> 14973.51s]  Oh, I did. You guys didn't. Oh, okay. Oh, shit. All right. But, uh, okay. Here we go.
[14973.51s -> 15009.32s]  I wanted this one. Is this this one? There it is. All right. So that's nine, nine, eight, five.
[15009.32s -> 15015.58s]  Cool. That was fun. So what efficiency? That's okay. Let's go over it. Comprehension.
[15015.58s -> 15020.06s]  The ability to understand where to apply force to control the position and angle of an object.
[15020.06s -> 15031.13s]  I know how to fucking punch really, really fucking hard. You understand? Insight. Wise
[15031.13s -> 15044.79s]  enough to see that it is actually simple. That's all right. That's fine. I just like choked.
[15044.79s -> 15053.72s]  Inspiration. Eye-opening thinking. That's all right. Aggressive sensations that generate
[15053.72s -> 15060.98s]  large movements with strong force. Efficiency. The shrewdness of having multiple functions in
[15060.98s -> 15071.21s]  one object. You give me a stick and that's that I use that stick to swing at people
[15071.21s -> 15079.86s]  in the caveman lands. I'm not going to make it a tool, but I'll tell you,
[15079.86s -> 15097.85s]  I can comprehend what I can comprehend a stick. It's so funny. All right. I'm right at the top
[15097.85s -> 15104.97s]  of the curve. This is normal. This is normal. Humans are here. Okay. I'm very, it's average.
[15105.53s -> 15113.62s]  I never told you I was a super intelligent person. I mean, I feel like I think it used to be over.
[15113.62s -> 15121.98s]  This is not a real IQ test. Why am I acting like it is? The number is your username. Yeah.
[15121.98s -> 15136.98s]  German985. You're one point below average. Whatever. You said it was going to be higher
[15136.98s -> 15165.18s]  than all of us. Don't be discouraged. I'm 128. No, that's good. 130 is better, but 28 is all right.
[15165.18s -> 15178.18s]  I want to see a couple other things though. That chatter is a genius. All right. What is this?
[15178.18s -> 15186.02s]  The blue ball will shrink when touched. Make it go touch the ground. That's when you have 100 IQ.
[15186.02s -> 15199.67s]  That's how you figure it out real fast. Make them fit. We need some more music. Man, I love that
[15199.67s -> 15210.12s]  Saitama song. Don't you? I don't even like, you know what I mean? Oh, you know what I mean, Vern?
[15210.12s -> 15218.74s]  Don't bat-chest me. No, actually don't bat-chest me. That song is great. That's an amazingly composed
[15218.74s -> 15227.75s]  song. The composition in that. I know composition. You just saw that I do. It's phenomenally crafted.
[15227.75s -> 15251.74s]  I know how to crap things. All right. So you got to go quick. I need a new OST. Did you put your IQ
[15251.74s -> 15265.10s]  in your username? That's cringe. German98.5. Ocarina of Time. I did say I was going to do
[15265.10s -> 15280.58s]  Animal Crossing. That's right. You guys having fun? You having fun? Hey, you having a good time?
[15280.58s -> 15310.15s]  How did that not fit? That was a bug. I like this one. Orange objects will disappear when touched.
[15310.15s -> 15327.30s]  Make the balloon touch the left wall. Come on. IQ under pressure is probably a lot different than
[15327.30s -> 15336.30s]  sitting quietly in a testing room by yourself. Yeah. Water balloon. Put every drop in the beaker.
[15336.30s -> 15372.78s]  Ah, interesting. Interesting. Interesting. Nice. Where's my water level? That's an old one. That's
[15372.78s -> 15385.14s]  a really old one. Do you know what's crazy about iPad games and mobile games now? I don't know if
[15385.14s -> 15395.45s]  they were like this before. Holy shit. If you go to the, what the app is tracking and the privacy
[15395.45s -> 15402.98s]  stuff that Apple has in the Apple store, it is unbelievable. What you need to know about me,
[15402.98s -> 15412.42s]  for me to play your match three video game. It's fucked. I remember looking at one. It was like,
[15412.42s -> 15420.70s]  oh, like, I don't want to say a wrong game, but one of them wanted, it was going to like email,
[15420.70s -> 15429.34s]  like location, precise location, purchase ID, device ID. It was literally every single possible
[15429.34s -> 15436.39s]  thing. Every single possible thing. It was just like, why do you need all this information? And
[15436.47s -> 15439.99s]  sometimes you'll go to one, it'd be on the app store and you're like, all right, what do they
[15439.99s -> 15445.35s]  want from me now? Let me guess. You want like my fucking credit card number and everything. You
[15445.35s -> 15449.67s]  want to know like who I am and everything about me. And then you scroll down. It's like this app
[15449.67s -> 15457.29s]  does not collect any information. Sometimes I just buy those. Sometimes I just buy them. I just buy
[15457.29s -> 15470.42s]  them because like, yup, you're, I get you. And you're fucking, you thank you. Billionaire,
[15470.42s -> 15478.47s]  millionaire rich. I mean, a lot of these are like $2 guys. And I play them. If I'm
[15478.47s -> 15482.95s]  on the fence for a mobile game and mobile game developers, I'm talking to you directly.
[15482.95s -> 15487.75s]  If I'm on the fence about a mobile game, if I'm looking at it like, hmm, all right, this is like,
[15487.75s -> 15494.10s]  this is like two, three bucks. Okay. Well, this is like a game. I go right down there and I go,
[15494.10s -> 15500.25s]  you taking anything? If the answer is no, I'm not on the fence anymore. I'm going to try it out.
[15500.25s -> 15505.00s]  I'm going to check it out. I'm talking to you. What about that family guy game? I don't know.
[15505.00s -> 15512.09s]  That was like, it was like eight years ago. I don't know. I have no idea. This feature
[15512.09s -> 15527.06s]  wasn't available in like iOS two or whatever it was. And, and also sometimes you go to that,
[15527.06s -> 15531.86s]  the privacy thing and it's like, oh yeah, it's collecting, you know, like device information.
[15531.86s -> 15536.58s]  Okay. Like you, you know, bugs and stuff. All right. We need to know what kind of device this
[15536.58s -> 15543.93s]  is to make sure I'm all right with that. I'm okay with device kind of information. That's fine.
[15543.93s -> 15556.25s]  That is fine. But once it's like, Hey, um, what are your emails? I don't, what are you,
[15556.25s -> 15576.09s]  what are you talking about? Oh, that was close. Oh, that's close. I like in behind the knee
[15576.09s -> 15593.32s]  and then right there. And then a little bit of fulcrum action and let's go for it. I actually
[15593.32s -> 15627.90s]  just hit my hands on my thing. Don't do it. You have a home alone IQ. What does that? I,
[15627.90s -> 15632.12s]  what does that mean? I think I know what that means. That means that like in a scenario where
[15632.12s -> 15636.28s]  I'm going to be dropping paint cans on strings to hitch people in the face. Is that what you mean?
[15636.28s -> 15644.20s]  Like that's what I can do when it comes to deducing problems. Hey, Jerma, we have this
[15644.20s -> 15648.60s]  complicated problem that we need to, uh, uh, for, you know, customer information and, uh,
[15648.60s -> 15656.87s]  can you give us a hand here? Yeah. How about you put some paint cans on some string and then when
[15656.87s -> 15663.91s]  they walk in, you let go of the paint can holding it in a pendulum fashion and it'll break their
[15663.91s -> 15673.53s]  nose and shatter their fucking face. Well, this is a, this is a marketing call in which
[15673.53s -> 15687.05s]  I was trying to figure out marketing stuff. Oh, just call me when you need me. The home alone
[15687.05s -> 15692.63s]  movies are some of my favorite movies ever as one of the specific reasons why is because it lives
[15692.63s -> 15701.38s]  in a cartoon world, but it's supposed to be like real life Chicago. If you took a paint can to the
[15701.38s -> 15713.30s]  face, you might die. It might kill you. The, the second that one of those dudes falls down the
[15713.30s -> 15738.06s]  stairs and there's like nails sticking out. They're dead. I do love, uh, the Joe Pesci psych.
[15742.38s -> 15747.66s]  Nobody does that anymore. When was the last time you heard of razza frazza?
[15747.66s -> 15754.57s]  They don't do it anymore. Oh, there's also the, yeah, this is one of my favorite parts of the
[15754.57s -> 15765.61s]  movie. Marv literally throws a brick at this kid. Like he's trying to hit this kid with a brick
[15765.61s -> 15777.37s]  and like he's trying to, it's, it's, it's unbelievably throws it as hard as he can.
[15777.37s -> 15792.02s]  The brick is going very fast. I, that's one of my favorite scenes. That was quick. They're
[15792.02s -> 15801.11s]  legitimately trying to kill him in that movie. They really are. How do, how do we do this?
[15803.26s -> 15815.54s]  You need to touch the bottom one. Well, Oh, look at that. Hey, I know what we got to do.
[15815.54s -> 15827.98s]  What are your thoughts on cheddar checks? I'm going to have to recommend you a far superior
[15827.98s -> 15840.41s]  product. The far superior product is the cheese it mix. The cheese it mix is the best one of all.
[15840.41s -> 15848.38s]  The cheese it mix is cheez-its, which are phenomenal. They're pretzels, which are phenomenal.
[15848.38s -> 15856.54s]  It's the little breads, which are phenomenal. And it's the little white puffs, which are phenomenal.
[15856.54s -> 15862.84s]  Ain't no bullshit in there that you want. There's nothing you're going to skip over there.
[15862.84s -> 15871.10s]  It's only the best part of every single mixed, uh, snack mix up thing. And it's got a lot of
[15871.10s -> 15877.74s]  little breads in there. You just know complaints when you take a handful because sometimes you
[15877.74s -> 15884.01s]  don't, the checks ones are fine, but sometimes I get to the point where there's kind of too
[15884.01s -> 15891.13s]  many checks left and I don't really want to eat checks anymore. That does not happen at all when
[15891.13s -> 15974.94s]  eating the cheese it one. So that answers your question. What the fuck? Really? What is going
[15974.94s -> 16019.61s]  on here? What is happening? Oh, I get it. I need to like swing it. How am I going to do that? I
[16019.61s -> 16110.66s]  got to yank it. Wait, what if I do this? This might be kind of weird. Leave only one. That's easy.
[16125.05s -> 16205.69s]  Make the ball touch all the red area. That ball? Shoot. I'm sorry. Yeah. Uh, I don't know. All I
[16205.69s -> 16248.65s]  know how to do is make seesaws and fulcrums and hooks that don't work. Make a hammer and have a
[16248.65s -> 16321.86s]  pivot around the center. Is it? Oh, I did it. Yes. New quest. Let me tell you something.
[16321.86s -> 16330.36s]  Quasimodo. Quasimodo. No, you should not. Don't ever feel like you can't talk to me. Quasimodo.
[16330.36s -> 16414.97s]  Keep your drawing in the red area. Three, two, three, two, one. Put all the blue balls in the
[16414.97s -> 16450.74s]  beaker. I think I can handle that. I think I can handle it. Quasimodo. We get it. You watched that
[16450.74s -> 16468.26s]  movie like a week ago. Yeah. So what? Can you please say stones the way that you do? I don't
[16468.26s -> 16496.92s]  know. How many subs came in today? The stones. What the fuck did I think that was going to do?
[16496.92s -> 16581.30s]  It kind of worked. Yay. The springs actually do that? Can I make these? Make all the yellow
[16581.30s -> 16605.03s]  balls touch the red area. Ooh. Well, uh, how do I do this? It's time for a fulcrum. It might be.
[16605.03s -> 16634.49s]  I think you're right. I don't know how to do this. Make the ball touch the ground.
[16634.49s -> 16727.13s]  Just fill it with packing peanuts. Son of a gun. I think you're onto something. Yeah.
[16727.13s -> 16762.81s]  Make the balloon touch the left wall. How is this going to get through? How the fuck is this going
[16762.81s -> 16846.50s]  to get through? I mean, can the ball even fit through there? Put all the red balls in the box.
[16846.50s -> 16897.45s]  It's an easy task. Just got to get a little bit of wedge action in here. Make the balloon touch
[16897.45s -> 16920.82s]  the left wall. Wait, I have to pop that. How am I going to pop this? Oh, I know. Displacement.
[16920.82s -> 16978.47s]  Fucking touch it already. Touch it. It was never going to work, was it? Maybe it will. Oh, wait a
[16978.47s -> 17001.43s]  minute. Okay. I can do it with displacement. What are you? What? Touch that wall. Oh, I didn't think
[17001.43s -> 17056.22s]  about what I was doing. It's all right. I'll get it with displacement. Shit. All right. Just touch
[17056.22s -> 17095.50s]  the left wall. Hurry up. Touch the wall. This shit is fucking hard. It's just like, it makes me want
[17095.50s -> 17102.87s]  to just get up and run a lap. I just want to get up and run a lap. I just need to move. You know,
[17102.87s -> 17107.21s]  do you know what I mean? You know what I'm saying? You know what I mean, Vern? I said that like
[17107.21s -> 17174.55s]  thousand times tonight. Got it. Got it. Put more than five blue balls in the beaker. Oh, displacement.
[17174.55s -> 17233.14s]  How would you ever make this work? How would I scoop? Make a spoon? That's not how a spoon goes.
[17233.14s -> 17284.25s]  I don't. I mean, how do I make it scoop? Like, how? How would I make it? All it does is fall down.
[17284.25s -> 17321.88s]  How do I? How the hell do I make a wedge? Make it pointing down. I don't. I love his brain. Just
[17321.88s -> 17326.28s]  make it straight like just like a knife just falling straight down the middle. But how am
[17326.28s -> 17354.63s]  I going to scoop them into the thing? That doesn't help me at all. More than five, by the way. I don't
[17354.63s -> 17373.64s]  think that's going to happen. Where is it? Remember how a shovel works? Yes. A shovel works by me
[17373.64s -> 17382.01s]  digging down and then lifting up. All I can do is let go of the shovel in my hands and drop it on
[17382.01s -> 17406.65s]  the ground. See what I'm saying? So here's your shovel. These are my fingers grabbing it, right?
[17406.65s -> 17426.62s]  So I'm grabbing onto the shovel here, my arms, and this is we're not going to finish that drawing.
[17426.62s -> 17433.78s]  Oh, that's one too. I think I can just do it. I'll just get it. Ready? We're just driving a nail
[17433.78s -> 17494.65s]  into this. Put one of the balls on the ground. That's fun. What was this one? No, OK, I did a
[17494.65s -> 17502.87s]  lot of these already. What about this one? Touch all the orange balls. The orange balls will explode
[17502.87s -> 17555.11s]  when touched. Why would you do it any other way? Make the red bar touch the ground. This is going
[17555.11s -> 17595.27s]  to be really hard. Oh, still possible. That right side. Get in there. It's right there.
[17599.77s -> 17631.27s]  Yeah, that's annoying. It might wedge in. This is my like, how annoying can I be in one day stream?
[17631.27s -> 17662.82s]  We're getting our limit. OK, I think I can just drop it from here. Just don't get rid of area.
[17662.82s -> 17677.29s]  Why would I get rid of everything though? Make the red ball touch the red area. This is moving.
[17677.29s -> 17692.84s]  It's not something weird. Like, hold on. I just want to see what happens. Oh, I can't even. Wait,
[17692.84s -> 17714.12s]  what? Oh, I see. OK, you have to blow into your mic for this one. It's interactive. What was that
[17714.12s -> 17730.54s]  on the DS? DS game. Um, I think I'm just going to make a big one. Does that work? Oh, keep going.
[17730.54s -> 17776.38s]  There it is. Oh, no, it's not. Oh, keep going. Keep going. It's almost there. There it is. Yes.
[17776.38s -> 17799.99s]  Oh, OK, this shouldn't be that bad. It's not that bad. And I've even made him do a front flip.
[17799.99s -> 17831.86s]  Uh, what? Come on, do it. That should be good. Uh, no, just a little too much. I think I got to
[17831.86s -> 17836.30s]  queue another one up. Yep. Just like that. Got to do one and then drop this one from a little bit
[17836.30s -> 17867.56s]  higher. Uh, I can't draw in this circle. So for when yelling at me. I just had it too. One chat
[17867.56s -> 17898.89s]  never got in my head. I just beat it. Why did I let it go? Really stopped it perfectly in his foot.
[17898.89s -> 17932.01s]  All right, don't move. Very nice. Very nice. Make the red areas touch each other. My goodness. This
[17932.01s -> 17967.42s]  kind of hurts my head. Make all the red squares fly out of the screen. Drop some big balls on it.
[17967.42s -> 17989.93s]  I think that's probably correct. What else we got? Did this one? Did that one? Make the rabbit touch
[17989.93s -> 18018.79s]  the flag. It's slippery. That'll be enough. Is it too much? Just a little. How gentle do I have to
[18018.79s -> 18062.57s]  be? OK, it'll get there. Let's give it a second. Move the red thing into the screen. Move the
[18062.57s -> 18135.14s]  red thing into the screen. Wait, I got an idea. Well, that was bad, but whatever. It was bad. OK,
[18135.14s -> 18193.83s]  I'll get it right. All right. Inched out a little. Come on. Yep. Oh, I blocked it. Pull it? Like,
[18193.83s -> 18248.76s]  I don't know. What am I supposed to pinch it out? Does that help? Way too far. You know what I'm
[18248.76s -> 18290.52s]  doing. Let's fucking go. Oh, almost worked. Almost worked. You know what I'm doing. Going for it again.
[18296.31s -> 18307.90s]  Would you guys allow me one more Quasimodo? Can I do one more? Can we do a poll, please? Can I say
[18307.90s -> 18358.84s]  Quasimodo as that character one more time? Let's do a poll. It's going to work. It's your stream,
[18358.84s -> 18413.02s]  man. Quasimodo. I don't know. I can't grip it, though. That's not a bad idea. Wait a minute.
[18413.02s -> 18443.34s]  We'll use displacement. Yes, 83% said I could do it again. Yeah, I'm not very good at this.
[18443.34s -> 18453.06s]  It's OK, though. I'm just having fun. You mean like this part here? That's actually, if that's
[18453.06s -> 18484.70s]  what you mean, then that's definitely a great idea. Can I weigh in the end down? Can I weigh it down?
[18484.70s -> 18520.65s]  I think it's too heavy. Grab top and slide to lock it in. I don't know. I don't know how you
[18520.65s -> 18542.71s]  do a pulling action. I don't know. Someone's smart to figure it out. Pour it out. Oh, I did it.
[18542.71s -> 18600.15s]  I did it. I did it. I kind of did it. I did it. Did I do it? Did I do it? Didn't do it. I had a
[18600.15s -> 18639.83s]  lot of momentum on it. Just rip it down. No. All right, now get out of the way. That was perfect.
[18639.83s -> 18680.44s]  Oh, more. That has to be it. I don't think so. It went back in. Yeah, I wish we'd just stop moving.
[18680.44s -> 18690.44s]  It's hard to actually hook onto it. All right, now it's coming out, but now it's going back.
[18690.44s -> 18698.09s]  No, there it is. God damn it. Does this have to be longer maybe? I don't know how much longer
[18698.09s -> 18707.14s]  I'd want to make it till I pull it there, like pull it back. Oh, yes. All right, now keep going,
[18707.14s -> 18725.98s]  please. Come on, do it. No, it got to the end and screwed up. Oh, don't do this to me right now,
[18725.98s -> 18762.02s]  please. Oh, my God. What is even happening right now? Wouldn't it have to go out this way?
[18762.02s -> 18792.10s]  You have to get it to go on its own. I think that will weigh it down enough and then fall off and
[18792.10s -> 18815.00s]  then fall off and then fall off. All right, it fell off. Fall off. All right, now do it naturally.
[18815.00s -> 18822.63s]  There it is. Get it out. Should be perfect now. It's look at it. And then look, it bugged out again.
[18822.63s -> 18828.54s]  No, I think it's good. Good. Almost. No shit. What the hell's going on here?
[18828.54s -> 18876.14s]  Fuck. It's too wide. I don't want to make it this wide. Can I pull it down? Spin it. A physics
[18876.14s -> 18886.68s]  puzzle where the physics fall out of the hole. All right, so the thing's going and then it just
[18886.68s -> 18918.86s]  like detaches. Like, why does it pull out and start going in a random direction? What just happened?
[18918.86s -> 18937.99s]  Like, I'm not even allowed to do what I just did and I just did it. All right, start. All right,
[18937.99s -> 18965.50s]  it's going to have momentum. Right, go. All right, now can I stop it? It's still kind of going.
[18965.66s -> 18999.37s]  See, it's all fucked up again. What's happening here? What is going on? Shouldn't it be going like
[18999.37s -> 19006.04s]  this still? Like, how would it be stuck here? Like, falling out of the back? Why does it
[19006.04s -> 19049.34s]  keep doing that? So what's the play here? I don't get it. Hook it again. I'm blocking it now. It
[19049.34s -> 19080.23s]  doesn't weigh enough to keep going. Can I just try to, I don't know, just pull it off. Push it
[19080.23s -> 19087.50s]  out with balls. I don't want to get any stuck in here. I feel like it's so close. I just want to
[19087.50s -> 19097.06s]  drag it off. I guess I could go like this. Can I like just pull it down from here? There it is.
[19097.06s -> 19100.66s]  And that should be, ah, all right. We're getting there. We're getting somewhere. We're getting
[19100.66s -> 19126.95s]  somewhere. I'm afraid to hook it, but I'm gonna. All right, we're, oh, is it in the perfect spot
[19126.95s -> 19140.62s]  to just fucking ruin everything? Come on, dude. Really? No, it's not. You hooked it too deep.
[19140.62s -> 19149.02s]  I think I can still do it though. Hold on. I think I can do it if I go like this and just have it
[19149.02s -> 19183.86s]  drag it a little. I'm going to grab the whole thing and like spin it. Do it. No, it's happening.
[19183.86s -> 19192.36s]  Pull it down. Pull it down. You can do it. I, it's not over. It's not over yet. This just needs to
[19192.36s -> 19196.90s]  a little bit more weight has to be up here. I'm going to wait till it gets to here and then let
[19196.90s -> 19215.06s]  it go. I'm going the other way. Okay. All right. There's a little bit of progress. At least I moved
[19215.06s -> 19250.33s]  it. Drag it down with my last try and I'm done. Okay. That was a good pull. Very good. That was
[19250.33s -> 19262.92s]  a great start. Okay. And now what do I do? Good start. Phenomenal start. I'm just going to pull
[19262.92s -> 19289.40s]  it down like this. I'm not putting anything in there yet. I'm so afraid to hook this wrong.
[19289.40s -> 19305.82s]  Do an L. You mean, okay. So you mean like this, like that, like that hook with L do a seven hook
[19305.82s -> 19326.23s]  hook an L and L will fall. Yeah. No, no, no. Go all the way, please. Okay. It's almost there.
[19326.95s -> 19370.74s]  I'm so scared to fuck this up. Oh, it's so close. That's it right there. I went. Yep. There it is.
[19370.74s -> 19386.54s]  Thank God. Roll the thing out to the left side. Roll the thing out to the left side. I don't get
[19386.54s -> 19436.15s]  it. I'm so glad that that went completely off screen. I don't even know what it was. I got it.
[19436.15s -> 19485.80s]  Okay. So I just got to pull it now. How can I pull it from here? I have an idea. See if it works.
[19485.88s -> 19560.89s]  You got to pull it off screen. Come on. Crunch it. Oh, yanked. Uh oh. What was wrong with that?
[19560.89s -> 19572.63s]  How did I not yank it? Let's pull it all the way to the left. All right. This is the last one.
[19572.63s -> 19577.80s]  And I'm going to call it for tonight. This game is fun though. If you're, if you have a brain
[19577.80s -> 19584.74s]  and it works and you have it, I would say at least like, you know, like a seventh grade education,
[19584.74s -> 19606.20s]  you'd probably have a good time playing it. I wonder should it be bigger here in the middle?
[19606.20s -> 19632.50s]  Oh, I'll do. I'll try the hell levels. That's a good idea. It didn't even grip. I wish there
[19632.50s -> 19657.82s]  was a fill tool. I would use it right now. Oh, I got it. I got it. Um, pull it down. How far?
[19657.82s -> 19708.30s]  Wow. How big is this thing? I yanked it. It's a, it's a, I won. Keep going. We'll get it already.
[19708.30s -> 19746.52s]  I wonder if it's stuck more at the top. I just dragged it more ramp. I don't think I can get it.
[19746.52s -> 19788.86s]  Inch it in the middle. I don't think I can. All right. I'm done. Wait, look at how many levels
[19788.86s -> 19796.23s]  there are. This is ridiculous. Let the red ball touch the ground. Okay. I can't make anything up
[19796.23s -> 19839.59s]  there. Can't make anything down here. I have an idea. I'm curious. It's too bouncy. Jeremy,
[19839.59s -> 19888.97s]  you're crazy, dude. Uh, I'm all right. Okay. All right. So I effectively made a exit to have a new
[19888.97s -> 19975.08s]  idea. Okay. It doesn't weigh enough. I apologize. I looked up the IQ 130 speed run record and it's
[19975.08s -> 19983.35s]  all hooks with balls attached to them. I should have not slandered you. Thank you. I really
[19983.35s -> 20012.17s]  appreciate it. Okay. This one's crazy. Keep 10 or more drawing objects on the screen. Uh, what?
[20012.17s -> 20026.33s]  10 or more objects? I guess like the only way to do this is to click a million times. All right.
[20026.33s -> 20045.91s]  God. You have to move the, I can't do it in the same spot. It's, it's too hard because you have
[20045.91s -> 20074.34s]  to move the mouse too. That's fucking impossible. Hold on. Let me get in the right mindset here.
[20074.34s -> 20117.13s]  I'm just gonna, I'm gonna take the music out. I'm just gonna go. I'm in like a shitty position
[20117.13s -> 20158.65s]  here. I need to like be, I need to get leverage on them on the ground. I almost had it. It's just,
[20158.65s -> 20206.66s]  it's the, it's having to drag the mouse too. It's like fucking impossible. Hold on. Oh,
[20216.41s -> 20244.58s]  let's go. I get it. How many is that? This is actually really fucking hard. One, two, three,
[20244.58s -> 20280.42s]  four, five, six, seven, eight. Okay. This is good. This is a good way to do it. This is,
[20280.42s -> 20301.43s]  how many is that? One, two, three, four, five, six. No, hold on. I gotta get like five or six
[20301.43s -> 20349.27s]  out. Shit. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. Hey, fucking hand hurts.
[20384.22s -> 20407.66s]  Why did I do it the other way? My whole body hurts now. Okay. That's one, two, three, four,
[20407.66s -> 20440.62s]  five, six, seven, eight, nine. Aye. Game is like crashing. Look at us. Something's wrong. Hold on.
[20440.62s -> 20466.36s]  Oh shit. I can't. It hurts. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,
[20467.50s -> 20543.27s]  10. Aye. Go left and right instead of, that's a good idea. Nine every time. Fuck you. Damn it.
[20543.99s -> 20580.47s]  I can't. It's so hard. It just like hurts to do. Where's the actual game area? Okay. Like look at
[20580.47s -> 20611.99s]  this. Not even the right area. I can't click up here. Stupid. Two, three, four, five, six. That's
[20611.99s -> 20618.60s]  10 objects on the screen. Where's the, what are you talking about? One, two, three, four, five,
[20618.60s -> 20653.02s]  six, seven, eight, nine. This is 10, right? No, it's not. You gotta be fucking kidding me. No,
[20653.02s -> 20659.66s]  the lag just ruined everything. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. You gotta be
[20659.66s -> 20704.15s]  fucking kidding me, dude. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. I got five here.
[20704.15s -> 20730.44s]  Six, seven, eight, nine, 10. Holy shit. This is a good one. Look at this idea. Watch this idea.
[20730.44s -> 20770.74s]  Watch this shit. Ready? This is the one right here. Guaranteed. It's coming. You know it is.
[20770.74s -> 20841.77s]  That's it right here. What? It's a finicky fucking game. Okay. It's finicky. I'm gonna fucking eat
[20841.77s -> 20874.71s]  my hand in a second. Oh my God. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. I'm going to
[20874.71s -> 20905.61s]  bite my fingernails. I did it. All right. I'll see you guys later. That was fun. That was crazy.
[20905.61s -> 20914.90s]  All right, guys. See you soon. I will see you guys in a couple days. Friday. We'll do Friday.
[20914.90s -> 20931.08s]  Maybe Friday, Saturday. Friday, Saturday. Friday, Sunday. Thanks for hanging out. The game, by the
[20931.08s -> 20937.85s]  way, is called Cue Remastered, if you're wondering. Play this again sometime. I think I've gotten out
[20937.85s -> 20943.96s]  of all the beginner and intermediate levels to a point where you actually have to really, really
[20943.96s -> 20953.21s]  be very intricate. You can't just draw hooks and seesaws anymore, but it's fun. It's a cool game.
[20953.21s -> 20974.84s]  I like it a lot. It's a good idea. I had fun with it. Multiplayer would be cool with this. It would be.
[20974.84s -> 20980.41s]  Yeah. I'll see you guys Friday at four o'clock. Pacific. That's the next time I plan on streaming.
[20980.41s -> 20993.42s]  Keep an eye on the sus. Thanks for watching. Anything else I wanted to talk about today?
[20993.42s -> 21010.33s]  I don't think so. Are you going to show the video that you're working on when it's done?
[21010.33s -> 21020.81s]  Yeah. I'm working on a video. You'll see it. It's not a big deal. It really isn't. It's just a
[21020.89s -> 21028.62s]  stupid... This video is probably going to be like seven minutes long. It's like a six to eight minute
[21028.62s -> 21038.94s]  video, but I need to make sure I'm in the right mindset because it's going to be... It's one of
[21038.94s -> 21051.93s]  my favorite videos. Is it going to go on the main channel, German985? It'd be kind of funny if this
[21051.93s -> 21058.81s]  was the video that I uploaded and you'll see why when you see it. Because if you don't know that
[21058.81s -> 21063.30s]  I moved over to Twitch pretty much permanently, if you don't know that and you just thought I
[21063.30s -> 21075.19s]  disappeared, you're going to think I sold the channel because this video would just... I mean,
[21075.19s -> 21080.17s]  it's going to be me in it. I'm going to be talking, but you're going to think that I sold the channel.
[21080.17s -> 21094.57s]  Like, there's going to be no way. It's going to be so jarring for so many people. I can't... Actually,
[21094.57s -> 21110.95s]  maybe I will just do it. It'll be funny. Yeah. Yeah. You'll see it. You'll see it. It's coming
[21110.95s -> 21116.22s]  out in about two weeks. Maybe earlier. It depends if I really just want to go for it.
[21117.75s -> 21123.83s]  All right. Good night. Goodbye. See you soon. Thanks for watching. Thanks for hanging out,
[21123.83s -> 21131.22s]  obviously. Have a great night. Call your mother. See you soon. See you Friday. Four o'clock Pacific.
[21131.22s -> 21152.82s]  Have a great night, everybody. See you soon. Okay. Hold on. Somebody said,
[21152.82s -> 21159.93s]  can you please confirm that it's not another Spider-Man update video? No, it is not. This is a
[21159.93s -> 21169.85s]  video. This is a real video. It's not a Spider-Man update video. Good guess, though, because that
[21169.85s -> 21214.09s]  would have been a really good guess. All right. See you later. Somebody said,
[21214.09s -> 21222.47s]  Jeremy, I know you're still here reading chat. Yeah. Yeah, I am. Usually do until the video turns
[21222.47s -> 21261.98s]  off. I see the shit, you guys, right? I'm watching. All right. Goodbye. Hey, it's me again. I'm really
[21261.98s -> 21269.29s]  trying to get this to end at five, five, five, five, five. Five hours, 55 minutes, 55 seconds.
[21269.29s -> 21279.91s]  See if I can get it. You guys remember that? I would... All right. I have 10 seconds to say this.
[21279.91s -> 21285.27s]  Do you guys remember, like, seven years ago, I used to end a bunch of my streams with me
[21285.27s -> 21292.97s]  just screaming and then hitting end stream? That was like a joke for a while. All right.
