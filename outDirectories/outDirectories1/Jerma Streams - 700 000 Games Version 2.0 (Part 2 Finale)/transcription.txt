[1.02s -> 7.90s]  Welcome to the new year. Welcome to the new year.
[7.90s -> 13.18s]  To the new year. Welcome to the new year, right? It's kind of how I just said that.
[13.18s -> 38.57s]  No, that wasn't even- I wasn't making a joke. All right, hold on.
[38.57s -> 45.78s]  One second. Still with the road stream. Ah, eh, eh. Hold on a minute. I gotta stop the road.
[45.78s -> 56.22s]  Let's start in a minute. Slowly turning into the emote that I truly, truly am.
[57.42s -> 59.66s]  I'll be right back. Just gonna grab one more thing.
[60.30s -> 121.13s]  Hey, only like 382,000 more games left to play. See you in a moment. Okay.
[122.23s -> 127.58s]  I'm sitting here trying to clear my throat. Sinuses, my nasal passages.
[129.18s -> 134.26s]  There's Vegas air. Some of the cleanest in the world.
[134.26s -> 140.04s]  I kind of get this frog throat. After like an hour it goes away.
[144.20s -> 150.25s]  But yeah, today the plan- I could, you know, I could probably today- oh man,
[150.25s -> 155.21s]  I could probably do a pretty good Dutch right now with this kind of Vegas nose and Vegas throat.
[155.93s -> 161.34s]  Arthur, I've got a plan, Arthur. Just stick to the plan.
[162.62s -> 163.42s]  No, not deep enough.
[165.82s -> 172.63s]  You, Arthur, need to have a little faith, Arthur.
[172.63s -> 188.97s]  That wasn't bad. He's making that face right now.
[188.97s -> 192.01s]  I make that face every single morning when I get up.
[193.64s -> 197.72s]  That's the first image that you see when you see me in bed.
[199.91s -> 203.70s]  In fact, that image was taken. Kim took that picture.
[205.67s -> 208.31s]  I got up. We both sat up at the same time.
[208.31s -> 211.51s]  So I, you know, Undertaker rose and made that face.
[211.51s -> 218.50s]  She snapped a picture and right after that I said, oh, my back is killing me.
[225.27s -> 229.45s]  In bed? O-W-O? Why did I read that out loud?
[231.18s -> 234.14s]  So who did the filter thing? What filter?
[239.43s -> 243.51s]  What filter? I don't know what you mean.
[245.18s -> 247.26s]  I've never taken a photo with a filter in my life.
[247.82s -> 252.30s]  That's not real. I want to show people reality.
[252.30s -> 258.44s]  The real me. No dog noses on this streamer, I'll tell you that much.
[259.56s -> 261.24s]  All right, so here's what we're doing.
[262.34s -> 264.26s]  We're going to do the rest of the 700,000 games.
[264.26s -> 269.53s]  Last night got to a point where it was- I was a little- I was kind of exhausted,
[270.17s -> 272.07s]  so I figured we'd just close it out today.
[272.87s -> 275.67s]  And I'm not sure what's going to happen after.
[276.55s -> 282.33s]  Because this might actually take us like at least three, maybe four hours to do this.
[283.37s -> 288.81s]  So I- this might be another full stream because there are a lot left.
[289.53s -> 297.18s]  And then we could probably maybe take the things that we were going to do
[297.18s -> 299.90s]  afterwards and just do them another time.
[300.70s -> 302.54s]  I never like to just rush into shit, you know?
[302.54s -> 306.36s]  I'd like to take my time. Like right now.
[306.36s -> 309.88s]  I've been live for five minutes, and we're at the starting soon screen.
[311.67s -> 313.83s]  And the Spaz just gave five community subs.
[315.03s -> 316.79s]  Coming in going, boom!
[318.28s -> 319.24s]  Dropping some community subs.
[319.24s -> 320.12s]  Thank you so much, Spaz.
[323.69s -> 325.61s]  My husband listens to you more than me.
[328.71s -> 330.87s]  Uh, you listening right now?
[331.51s -> 335.03s]  Communication is so important in a relationship.
[337.27s -> 340.15s]  Listening to each other's needs and wants, and making sure that
[340.87s -> 341.83s]  you're both taken care of.
[342.55s -> 345.64s]  It's very important, Rick.
[346.36s -> 353.26s]  German never listens to me.
[359.14s -> 360.74s]  All right, that's enough of the intro screen.
[360.74s -> 361.30s]  What do you say?
[361.30s -> 362.50s]  Here it is.
[362.50s -> 365.70s]  That- okay, look, it looks like a lot of X's, but trust me, it's not.
[366.42s -> 366.82s]  It isn't.
[368.15s -> 371.51s]  That may look like a lot of X's, but when you take the X's away,
[373.80s -> 375.32s]  we got like half the games here.
[375.96s -> 377.08s]  It's an optical illusion.
[377.08s -> 381.64s]  Speaking of optical illusions, I want to make sure I bring this up before we go and even start here.
[382.62s -> 384.46s]  Um, how do I look today?
[385.18s -> 387.82s]  No, that's not what I- that's not the thing that I want to talk about, but
[389.69s -> 391.21s]  let's see how bad this is.
[391.21s -> 393.46s]  I'm gonna look like such shit.
[393.46s -> 394.10s]  Let's find out.
[394.10s -> 394.74s]  Ready?
[394.74s -> 396.74s]  You want to be the big face reveal for today?
[403.48s -> 404.44s]  Not that bad.
[404.44s -> 405.96s]  What's wrong with the camera, though?
[405.96s -> 414.78s]  Do I look like weird to anybody else today?
[416.57s -> 418.09s]  What- do I have eyebrows?
[418.09s -> 419.13s]  What happened to my eyebrows?
[419.69s -> 423.51s]  No, they're there.
[426.54s -> 428.38s]  I forgot to pencil in my eyebrows.
[430.23s -> 434.71s]  You look shattered.
[434.71s -> 436.63s]  I think I'm just- I am actually just getting old.
[438.20s -> 439.56s]  I look at- yeah, look at this.
[440.36s -> 442.52s]  I'm gonna have to start wearing, like, makeup.
[445.32s -> 445.82s]  Ugh.
[448.52s -> 449.64s]  Aging rapidly.
[449.64s -> 451.00s]  Yeah, it's been one day.
[451.00s -> 451.80s]  No, it's the lighting.
[451.80s -> 452.28s]  Hold on.
[452.28s -> 454.60s]  Let me- let me- Phil- Philips Hue!
[454.60s -> 455.56s]  Philips Hue!
[455.56s -> 456.92s]  Oh, you- no, you don't speak to it.
[456.92s -> 457.72s]  It's not like Alexa.
[458.28s -> 458.84s]  It's the lights.
[458.84s -> 459.34s]  Hold on.
[466.84s -> 468.84s]  You look like Draco Malfoyle.
[470.98s -> 473.14s]  Well, my house is Slytherin, does that make sense?
[478.46s -> 479.58s]  Let's make this better.
[485.50s -> 486.00s]  No.
[487.22s -> 487.72s]  No.
[490.14s -> 492.54s]  No, cause- I don't like this because I feel like I'm in a movie theater.
[493.74s -> 494.78s]  Now, let me- let me ask you.
[494.78s -> 497.10s]  This is very important before we get to the- before we get to the thing,
[497.10s -> 499.26s]  before getting to the thing, before getting to the thing I originally wanted.
[499.26s -> 499.76s]  To talk about.
[500.46s -> 502.86s]  Does anybody else here hate going to the fucking movies during the day?
[503.50s -> 504.00s]  I do.
[504.82s -> 505.86s]  I fucking despise it.
[506.82s -> 507.32s]  Ugh.
[509.32s -> 510.36s]  No, yeah, cause the lights.
[511.58s -> 513.66s]  It- it- it's like one o'clock in the afternoon.
[513.66s -> 514.38s]  A day movie.
[514.38s -> 515.66s]  You- okay, you hear me out on this.
[516.22s -> 517.26s]  One o'clock in the afternoon.
[517.90s -> 519.10s]  Oh, yeah, let's go see a movie.
[519.10s -> 520.94s]  You get in there and it's like, oh, yeah, that'll go.
[520.94s -> 523.66s]  It's like- it's bright summertime sunshine right now.
[523.66s -> 525.18s]  It's like 95 degrees out.
[525.18s -> 526.38s]  Let's get in that movie theater.
[527.02s -> 529.96s]  No, that was just the right one.
[532.09s -> 532.59s]  Here.
[532.89s -> 536.58s]  The whole- I can't-
[536.58s -> 537.78s]  It's light out right now.
[537.78s -> 539.54s]  So this is not- this reference isn't gonna work in-
[539.54s -> 541.06s]  I'm just gonna have to describe it to you, okay?
[542.10s -> 543.30s]  It's currently light out right now.
[543.30s -> 545.06s]  And I'm turning the lights off in the room like it's gonna do anything.
[545.96s -> 547.40s]  I- I hate going to the movies.
[547.40s -> 548.84s]  When it's, uh, when it's light.
[548.84s -> 551.00s]  Because you get in there and it's pitch black
[551.00s -> 552.76s]  and you have this beaming light in your face.
[552.76s -> 555.00s]  It's as if you're holding a fucking iPad in front of your face.
[555.64s -> 557.72s]  And then it's like for two hours you come out, you're like,
[559.40s -> 560.92s]  oh, and it's like so bright.
[560.92s -> 563.24s]  You feel- I need to go to bed after a movie.
[563.24s -> 564.25s]  Greasy hair?
[564.25s -> 568.14s]  No, it's shower.
[568.14s -> 571.58s]  I feel like it needs to be dark outside to see a movie.
[571.58s -> 575.54s]  That's at any time.
[575.54s -> 576.26s]  No, at night.
[576.82s -> 577.78s]  At night it's- it's-
[578.42s -> 579.70s]  The sky is- is black.
[580.26s -> 584.62s]  Coming out of a movie at two o'clock in the afternoon,
[584.62s -> 587.42s]  it's like- it's like drinking during the day.
[587.42s -> 590.30s]  Like that- that- ah, uh-uh.
[590.30s -> 592.22s]  No, it's like the same feeling.
[592.22s -> 595.27s]  I feel like I'm just like, I don't like any of this.
[597.54s -> 599.06s]  At the- yeah, the sky is black.
[599.06s -> 599.86s]  Yeah, it is.
[600.58s -> 604.06s]  It's a scientific little Elon Musk thing for you.
[604.06s -> 607.02s]  The sky is scientific, as Tesla taught me that.
[607.02s -> 608.22s]  The sky is blue and black.
[611.77s -> 612.97s]  He's stalling.
[612.97s -> 615.37s]  Well, I- I'm not stalling.
[621.37s -> 622.49s]  He's stalling.
[628.15s -> 629.83s]  Spaz gave another five community subs.
[630.39s -> 634.30s]  You guys wouldn't believe how much light actually fucks with you.
[636.41s -> 638.65s]  Light gets inside and fucks with your brain.
[638.65s -> 642.87s]  You know why it's- it's so hard to fall asleep sometimes at night?
[643.43s -> 644.63s]  Because you got that light.
[645.98s -> 647.90s]  Humans are all just made out of light.
[647.90s -> 657.16s]  You know, you're 70% light.
[657.16s -> 658.76s]  So which one are we going to?
[662.30s -> 663.02s]  What would you guys say?
[663.58s -> 666.46s]  If you were to make a choice here.
[666.46s -> 668.86s]  And by choice, I mean click on the screen.
[676.58s -> 678.66s]  14-year-old philosopher.
[678.66s -> 682.74s]  Well, we're not- we're definitely not going to do, uh, check- uh, I keep calling it checkers.
[685.32s -> 687.88s]  Oh, the- I forgot, yeah, right, the- the optical illusion.
[687.88s -> 689.08s]  All right, so here, hang me out on this.
[689.08s -> 690.12s]  This is for real, while you're voting.
[691.27s -> 694.79s]  Can- can- can I just see a shitload of the German old emote, please?
[695.96s -> 697.24s]  And I want you to look at it.
[697.24s -> 700.36s]  When it's next to other German old emotes, at least three or four of them.
[703.91s -> 705.75s]  It looks like a different emote.
[705.75s -> 706.47s]  It changes.
[706.47s -> 707.51s]  The face changes.
[708.23s -> 711.03s]  It's a fucked up optical illusion that I did not intend.
[713.50s -> 714.86s]  Some of them are, like, smirking.
[714.86s -> 716.22s]  Some of them have a frown.
[716.22s -> 717.02s]  It's really weird.
[721.00s -> 722.60s]  Well, that's- actually, this is impossible.
[722.60s -> 724.76s]  Because this too- the chat is going way too fast.
[727.66s -> 729.10s]  Some of them look older than others.
[730.68s -> 732.52s]  All right, how- how do I turn the chat off for a second?
[732.52s -> 733.00s]  Because I'll do it.
[734.86s -> 736.54s]  Any mods know how to just turn off the chat?
[738.25s -> 742.17s]  Like, can- can I just turn the chat off for, like, two minutes or something?
[742.17s -> 749.37s]  Is there a way to do that?
[750.01s -> 753.82s]  Is this- does this do anything?
[753.82s -> 754.78s]  Oh my fucking god.
[755.98s -> 756.78s]  Just scroll up.
[760.70s -> 762.78s]  Streamer bans 3,000 people.
[766.60s -> 767.64s]  You can't stop us.
[768.28s -> 773.85s]  Well anyways, okay, when you have some free time,
[774.49s -> 778.65s]  just do the German old emote a shitload of times and look at them.
[778.65s -> 779.45s]  They start moving.
[779.45s -> 780.25s]  They start talking.
[780.25s -> 781.37s]  They start talking to you.
[782.01s -> 784.18s]  I had a whole conversation with three of them.
[785.58s -> 786.46s]  All right, so we're going to...
[788.33s -> 789.61s]  Distinct Worlds.
[789.61s -> 790.41s]  I don't know what that is.
[790.41s -> 791.37s]  Distinct Worlds?
[792.01s -> 800.58s]  What is that?
[800.58s -> 801.14s]  What is it called?
[805.16s -> 806.92s]  Robotic Worlds.
[806.92s -> 808.94s]  Okay, cross your fingers.
[808.94s -> 809.58s]  Let's hope it works.
[812.46s -> 813.42s]  It works.
[813.42s -> 815.90s]  Now, but it's going to be an issue, but hopefully I can even open...
[819.66s -> 823.80s]  That was fucking loud.
[825.00s -> 826.55s]  Just give me a second.
[828.71s -> 836.73s]  Ah, yay, yay.
[836.73s -> 838.97s]  Uh, I have no idea.
[838.97s -> 840.49s]  I can't even see what I'm selecting.
[845.26s -> 846.30s]  What am I even clicking on?
[846.94s -> 849.58s]  I don't know what I just did.
[850.22s -> 851.66s]  It's just- the music stopped.
[851.66s -> 852.38s]  That's all that happened.
[853.02s -> 854.15s]  I'm going to reopen this.
[854.71s -> 857.03s]  What the fuck?
[857.03s -> 857.43s]  All right.
[857.43s -> 858.23s]  No more votes.
[858.23s -> 858.95s]  Thank you for voting.
[858.95s -> 859.91s]  I appreciate the votes.
[861.08s -> 863.72s]  Yeah, I turned it off because it was just so loud and so horrible,
[865.08s -> 866.04s]  but it's going to happen again.
[866.04s -> 867.72s]  So I'm going to go like this.
[867.72s -> 868.92s]  Let's see if you guys can see it.
[869.56s -> 872.50s]  Let's try it again.
[873.14s -> 874.74s]  This time I'm going to have to not move.
[878.34s -> 879.38s]  Robotic Worlds.
[880.10s -> 880.66s]  Incoming.
[887.29s -> 887.93s]  What?
[887.93s -> 888.89s]  That's it.
[888.89s -> 890.09s]  That's Robotic Worlds.
[890.09s -> 890.89s]  What a great game.
[892.58s -> 893.70s]  It's fantastic.
[895.54s -> 908.78s]  Okay.
[908.78s -> 910.26s]  That was Robotic Worlds.
[915.05s -> 915.45s]  Rigged.
[917.90s -> 920.46s]  Uh, oh, there's nothing I can do about that one.
[920.46s -> 920.78s]  Thank you.
[920.78s -> 922.94s]  Thanks for voting for it because they don't- it don't work.
[930.55s -> 931.35s]  Where- where is this?
[932.33s -> 932.89s]  Where am I?
[932.89s -> 933.85s]  Robotic Worlds.
[935.78s -> 939.14s]  It seems like all the interesting ones just are the ones that don't work.
[941.72s -> 942.60s]  Try again.
[942.60s -> 943.96s]  Don't click on a red X.
[943.96s -> 948.62s]  Don't click on a red X or it might ball up the tiles around it.
[948.62s -> 962.14s]  Okay, people are liking the, uh,
[962.38s -> 962.86s]  Riverboat.
[964.33s -> 964.81s]  Mermaid.
[966.92s -> 969.08s]  Uh, Nasty Diamonds.
[972.22s -> 976.98s]  And there, you know, there's always going to be 10 to 15% of every person that's going
[976.98s -> 980.39s]  to click on Connect 4.
[980.39s -> 982.47s]  Even when explicitly told.
[982.47s -> 983.67s]  This is my fair part.
[983.67s -> 985.35s]  Even when explicitly told.
[985.35s -> 986.87s]  This is the human mind at work.
[987.51s -> 992.31s]  Explicitly told that that I'm not going to play it.
[992.31s -> 993.35s]  I'm not going to click that.
[993.35s -> 994.15s]  It's not going to happen.
[994.15s -> 996.90s]  I'm going to do it anyways.
[1002.84s -> 1004.20s]  Nasty Diamonds.
[1004.20s -> 1005.56s]  Sounds like a strip club.
[1013.96s -> 1015.32s]  Chaotic Neutral Chat.
[1022.49s -> 1024.41s]  No, uh, 50%.
[1024.41s -> 1027.85s]  How many- how many fucking chaotic doofuses are in here right now?
[1028.41s -> 1030.20s]  That's what I wonder.
[1032.02s -> 1033.14s]  Well, it's this one up here.
[1033.14s -> 1035.54s]  It's, uh, Aquamaria.
[1035.54s -> 1036.50s]  I don't know what that is.
[1036.50s -> 1036.90s]  Let's see.
[1036.90s -> 1038.34s]  Aqua- what's it called?
[1038.34s -> 1039.22s]  Aquamania.
[1046.26s -> 1047.46s]  Awful stupid.
[1047.46s -> 1048.18s]  Lawful stupid.
[1048.18s -> 1049.14s]  I remember that whole thing.
[1049.14s -> 1049.70s]  That was fun.
[1050.95s -> 1052.39s]  Okay, let's see if this one works.
[1052.39s -> 1053.19s]  Aquamania.
[1057.88s -> 1058.44s]  It's opening.
[1059.00s -> 1059.64s]  It's closing.
[1060.20s -> 1060.92s]  Aquamania.
[1065.45s -> 1067.29s]  Okay, two in a row.
[1067.29s -> 1068.97s]  Is strike three going to happen?
[1068.97s -> 1077.62s]  Let's strike two.
[1078.90s -> 1083.80s]  Okay, really- we're really picking great ones.
[1084.60s -> 1086.12s]  And it's not even anybody's fault.
[1086.12s -> 1088.92s]  It's- it's this video game's fault.
[1089.64s -> 1094.60s]  I really am curious as to- we have to keep an eye on which ones don't work.
[1095.24s -> 1099.10s]  All right, aqua- aqua- there it is.
[1102.38s -> 1103.10s]  Uh, try again?
[1104.81s -> 1106.25s]  Strike three ends the stream.
[1107.99s -> 1108.71s]  No.
[1108.71s -> 1109.59s]  I just turned it on.
[1116.62s -> 1119.50s]  I- all I hear is a faint slap when that picture comes up.
[1121.24s -> 1122.68s]  Jerma, just play the game.
[1123.88s -> 1125.00s]  I just tried.
[1125.00s -> 1127.32s]  I just tried to do two different games.
[1132.30s -> 1135.26s]  All right, we're gonna do- looks like, uh, riverboat?
[1137.10s -> 1137.74s]  Riverboat.
[1138.89s -> 1141.21s]  Extreme riverboat challenge or something.
[1141.21s -> 1142.01s]  Whatever the hell it is.
[1142.57s -> 1149.22s]  That is over there on that second pack.
[1149.86s -> 1151.61s]  All right, riverboat.
[1152.87s -> 1156.95s]  I'm not gonna do connect four.
[1158.31s -> 1160.07s]  Extreme riverboat racing.
[1164.49s -> 1165.29s]  Well, it opens.
[1165.93s -> 1167.82s]  What a good sign.
[1169.18s -> 1178.94s]  The question is, can I get this in a window?
[1178.94s -> 1179.42s]  You got me.
[1179.42s -> 1186.47s]  You know, you don't- oh, what?
[1186.47s -> 1187.75s]  Wait, why?
[1193.29s -> 1198.57s]  You don't have 1920 by 1080, but you have 2048 by 1536.
[1202.41s -> 1205.29s]  What resolutions are you even attempting here?
[1208.14s -> 1209.66s]  What monitor size is this?
[1209.66s -> 1214.81s]  Is this like a- is this like a vertical 28 inch monitor?
[1214.81s -> 1219.93s]  I don't get it.
[1219.93s -> 1222.09s]  Run riverboat again to change resolution.
[1222.09s -> 1224.41s]  Okay, well, let's run riverboat again.
[1231.18s -> 1232.22s]  Five by four.
[1232.22s -> 1236.71s]  No, that's like a five by two vertical riverboat.
[1236.71s -> 1237.51s]  Let's open it again.
[1237.51s -> 1239.19s]  Let's see if this hopefully makes it better.
[1239.19s -> 1241.59s]  Hopefully it's not just like a fucking cube in the corner of your screen.
[1242.31s -> 1251.03s]  Are you trying to tell me that I made it unopenable?
[1255.66s -> 1256.38s]  No fucking way.
[1262.57s -> 1263.13s]  I made it.
[1263.69s -> 1267.45s]  I've made the game unopenable by changing its resolution.
[1274.15s -> 1275.43s]  I didn't do anything.
[1277.06s -> 1277.38s]  Why?
[1281.42s -> 1281.90s]  Hold on.
[1281.90s -> 1283.90s]  Let me like- oh my god.
[1283.90s -> 1285.10s]  Why is this happening?
[1286.65s -> 1288.49s]  I'm gonna have to go edit the INI file.
[1288.49s -> 1290.17s]  Yeah, if I don't- does it even have one?
[1298.02s -> 1304.66s]  Oh my god, this is fucking ridiculous.
[1304.66s -> 1306.02s]  Okay, what the hell is this thing called?
[1306.66s -> 1307.86s]  Riverboat challenge?
[1308.50s -> 1316.30s]  I'm shocked that this is three in a row here.
[1318.84s -> 1320.52s]  This is not even on a list.
[1321.54s -> 1323.46s]  Best game hits five and six.
[1324.50s -> 1325.54s]  It's not even here.
[1325.54s -> 1327.78s]  It deleted itself when I changed the resolution.
[1331.54s -> 1332.50s]  Yeah, that's what happened.
[1333.45s -> 1337.85s]  The game deleted its own folder when I changed its resolution.
[1349.08s -> 1349.64s]  No, there it is.
[1349.64s -> 1354.52s]  Okay, extreme- it's extreme riverboat racing, not just riverboat racing.
[1355.08s -> 1355.80s]  Okay, here we go.
[1356.87s -> 1357.98s]  Data.
[1357.98s -> 1358.54s]  Graphics.
[1359.94s -> 1360.42s]  Menu.
[1361.98s -> 1363.18s]  D3E.
[1363.18s -> 1365.18s]  No, this is none of- there's no INI.
[1365.18s -> 1365.90s]  There's nothing here.
[1370.47s -> 1371.11s]  No, it's over.
[1371.11s -> 1374.39s]  I can't- I can open it in safe mode, but this is a batch file.
[1374.39s -> 1376.07s]  I'm not double clicking a batch file.
[1378.41s -> 1379.37s]  Oh, what the fuck.
[1379.37s -> 1387.34s]  Hold on.
[1387.34s -> 1390.22s]  All right, maybe- okay, what if I just run it in 640x430?
[1390.22s -> 1396.39s]  I can do it- okay, I can run- I can force the game into 640x480 in the compatibility tab.
[1397.85s -> 1398.57s]  Let's see what happens.
[1399.21s -> 1409.35s]  Did it work?
[1409.35s -> 1409.91s]  Nope.
[1409.91s -> 1431.70s]  I don't understand what would be causing something like that.
[1432.34s -> 1435.06s]  That's such a- that's such a specifically awful bug.
[1438.47s -> 1443.03s]  That changing the resolution of the game makes the game no longer able to open ever again,
[1443.03s -> 1443.99s]  even if you change it back.
[1445.70s -> 1449.14s]  Holy shit, this is unbelievable.
[1454.90s -> 1456.18s]  I don't even know what to say.
[1459.51s -> 1459.99s]  Can I like-
[1463.56s -> 1464.60s]  Did you hear that little laugh?
[1466.04s -> 1469.62s]  I'm gonna be honest with you here though.
[1469.62s -> 1476.39s]  I don't- oh boy, this joke again.
[1476.39s -> 1477.27s]  What? Which one?
[1477.99s -> 1479.34s]  What did I do?
[1480.71s -> 1481.43s]  What did that do?
[1482.07s -> 1487.67s]  I should just be a country singer by the amount of times my voice cracks, seriously.
[1499.99s -> 1501.75s]  Bring back Super Frog.
[1503.08s -> 1503.32s]  No.
[1505.42s -> 1506.70s]  Terma is such a millennial.
[1506.70s -> 1507.50s]  I am a millennial.
[1508.06s -> 1508.86s]  Oh, I get what you're doing.
[1508.86s -> 1510.46s]  You're doing like the reverse boomer thing.
[1510.46s -> 1511.66s]  Okay, thanks.
[1511.66s -> 1514.14s]  All right, we're gonna go to Fantasy Island.
[1518.41s -> 1519.21s]  36%.
[1522.09s -> 1523.29s]  Fantasy Island.
[1526.33s -> 1528.01s]  Rollerball Fantasy Island.
[1528.01s -> 1530.57s]  Okay, are we going 4 for 4?
[1532.89s -> 1536.01s]  Is it possible to go 4 for 4 with games that don't work?
[1536.57s -> 1545.69s]  It's opening it in the other window.
[1549.75s -> 1550.95s]  Oh my god, it's-
[1551.43s -> 1553.67s]  Don't open in the other window.
[1553.67s -> 1555.11s]  Open in this window.
[1555.11s -> 1557.11s]  The one that's right here at my main monitor.
[1562.02s -> 1562.98s]  What the fuck?
[1566.34s -> 1567.22s]  Where is it gonna open?
[1567.78s -> 1569.91s]  Rollerball Fantasy Island.
[1569.91s -> 1570.47s]  Start game.
[1570.47s -> 1572.47s]  No, now it's opening in the main window.
[1580.52s -> 1581.40s]  Not doing that again.
[1583.59s -> 1585.27s]  I'm not doing that to you guys again.
[1585.27s -> 1598.06s]  I changed the resolution.
[1598.70s -> 1601.40s]  The phrase changed resolution.
[1602.04s -> 1603.80s]  All right, we're gonna change the resolution to
[1604.76s -> 1607.56s]  1152 by 864.
[1609.00s -> 1610.78s]  But look at how bad that-
[1610.78s -> 1613.08s]  All right, cartoon style.
[1613.08s -> 1613.64s]  Oh, I get it.
[1613.64s -> 1615.16s]  It's like fucking it's in the newspaper.
[1634.36s -> 1635.24s]  All right, it worked.
[1635.24s -> 1638.36s]  But you still can't see it over here.
[1638.36s -> 1640.65s]  I need to like make it-
[1640.65s -> 1642.33s]  I need to drag it to the left at least.
[1643.05s -> 1647.93s]  Probably be all right.
[1653.67s -> 1654.79s]  There we go.
[1654.79s -> 1655.67s]  I got it.
[1655.67s -> 1657.42s]  How bad is this?
[1657.42s -> 1658.86s]  This is so loud too.
[1658.86s -> 1667.66s]  There's only so much of the same five second loop
[1667.66s -> 1669.10s]  and it's speech volume.
[1669.18s -> 1672.14s]  Oh, you're a booter.
[1672.14s -> 1672.86s]  Wow.
[1672.86s -> 1674.86s]  Oh, it was funny.
[1676.44s -> 1677.40s]  Don't do it again.
[1678.28s -> 1679.08s]  Why is this here?
[1679.08s -> 1681.24s]  Sorry, but he's dead now.
[1681.24s -> 1683.32s]  Oh, it was awful.
[1685.91s -> 1686.95s]  You lost him.
[1690.44s -> 1691.88s]  Oh, you're a booter.
[1691.88s -> 1694.04s]  Wow, it was funny.
[1694.76s -> 1695.88s]  All right, I like this one.
[1695.88s -> 1697.24s]  I like this one because of that guy's voice.
[1697.24s -> 1698.36s]  It's the only good part about this.
[1701.16s -> 1701.72s]  All right, let's go.
[1702.44s -> 1707.42s]  Original levels, lost levels.
[1707.42s -> 1708.94s]  Like anyone's going to click this.
[1710.54s -> 1712.06s]  Snowland, Greenland, Fantasyland.
[1712.06s -> 1712.22s]  Which-
[1712.22s -> 1714.46s]  Okay, which Sonic the Hedgehog level should I start at?
[1715.42s -> 1717.96s]  I'm going to say green hill zone.
[1720.38s -> 1720.62s]  Oh.
[1725.00s -> 1727.40s]  Normal, hard, easy.
[1727.40s -> 1728.28s]  So what's the difference?
[1728.84s -> 1731.80s]  It just adds more like fucking sprinkles.
[1731.80s -> 1732.52s]  That's all it does.
[1733.08s -> 1735.82s]  I'm just going to do normal.
[1747.77s -> 1749.69s]  Level is complete.
[1751.42s -> 1752.22s]  Oh my God.
[1753.10s -> 1755.42s]  This guy, I turned him up louder than everything else.
[1756.38s -> 1757.42s]  Ready, go.
[1763.64s -> 1765.00s]  You know, all right.
[1765.00s -> 1767.96s]  So listen, I figured out what all these-
[1767.96s -> 1773.34s]  These games are the preloaded after school games.
[1774.14s -> 1776.33s]  Is that just Facebook?
[1780.60s -> 1784.20s]  This is what is allowed on your eighth grade school computer.
[1784.20s -> 1785.56s]  It's just the after school games.
[1785.56s -> 1786.20s]  Did I miss one?
[1787.34s -> 1788.30s]  Pass all the gates.
[1789.74s -> 1790.46s]  I did that, right?
[1791.91s -> 1795.35s]  Congratulations, level is complete.
[1795.35s -> 1797.51s]  The guy didn't scream at me, so I didn't do it.
[1798.71s -> 1801.91s]  Ready, go.
[1802.87s -> 1808.14s]  Should I keep cartoon style on?
[1808.14s -> 1808.78s]  What do you guys think?
[1819.61s -> 1819.93s]  No.
[1820.95s -> 1821.43s]  Get them all.
[1829.26s -> 1830.70s]  Tonight we go on a rock.
[1830.70s -> 1832.22s]  Tonight we gonna rock.
[1832.94s -> 1834.50s]  I need to get that one.
[1834.50s -> 1840.12s]  How do I get the secret one?
[1840.12s -> 1842.12s]  Is this one even humanly possible to get?
[1842.76s -> 1845.14s]  You can't get that one.
[1852.73s -> 1853.05s]  Jump?
[1856.38s -> 1857.26s]  What do you mean jump?
[1869.30s -> 1869.78s]  I can't-
[1870.50s -> 1872.66s]  Guys, I can't go this way.
[1872.66s -> 1873.78s]  It's an invisible wall.
[1881.77s -> 1882.33s]  What the-
[1882.33s -> 1883.05s]  All right.
[1883.05s -> 1886.25s]  No, you saw me try that like five times.
[1886.25s -> 1887.69s]  Ready, go.
[1887.69s -> 1894.76s]  It's the hit boxes that are the problem.
[1894.76s -> 1896.60s]  Not me and my big brain.
[1897.16s -> 1909.18s]  Okay, let's try that again.
[1909.91s -> 1918.66s]  Ready, remember.
[1918.66s -> 1921.06s]  Remember guys, Jeremy's stupid.
[1921.06s -> 1922.34s]  That's why I couldn't do that.
[1923.06s -> 1925.22s]  Remember, always remember.
[1926.39s -> 1929.35s]  It's always Mr. Jeremy's fault.
[1930.07s -> 1933.78s]  Flag.
[1933.78s -> 1950.44s]  Congratulations level is complete.
[1950.44s -> 1951.88s]  Ready, go.
[1951.88s -> 1953.32s]  All right, how much more of this can you guys take?
[1955.56s -> 1966.92s]  Congratulations level is complete.
[1968.68s -> 1969.96s]  Ready, go.
[1969.96s -> 1971.64s]  I was trying to get the other coins, man.
[1984.65s -> 1986.01s]  Doing this with the mouse just-
[1986.01s -> 1988.09s]  Okay, why was I doing it with the mouse?
[1988.09s -> 1989.37s]  What the fuck am I thinking?
[1990.25s -> 1992.54s]  It's so much easier with the keyboard.
[1993.18s -> 2006.79s]  Congratulations level is complete.
[2010.42s -> 2011.38s]  Ready, go.
[2012.10s -> 2020.39s]  I just want to make sure I get around there.
[2029.06s -> 2029.46s]  I don't-
[2029.46s -> 2030.98s]  Who cares if I don't get all the coins?
[2030.98s -> 2031.94s]  Does it really matter?
[2031.94s -> 2032.90s]  Don't do it again.
[2033.62s -> 2035.22s]  Ready, go.
[2035.22s -> 2038.63s]  Does it really matter if I don't get all the coins in this sloppy game?
[2044.17s -> 2046.81s]  I've eaten fucking sloppy joes that were easier to handle.
[2046.81s -> 2059.18s]  Congratulations level is complete.
[2059.74s -> 2062.73s]  This game's like Tommy Wiseau's dad.
[2063.69s -> 2064.86s]  This game-
[2064.86s -> 2065.98s]  Ready, go.
[2065.98s -> 2067.90s]  This game is Tommy Wiseau's dad.
[2068.46s -> 2068.70s]  What?
[2069.74s -> 2070.30s]  I don't-
[2070.30s -> 2072.30s]  Maybe that went too fast for me to see what you wrote.
[2074.82s -> 2080.74s]  What's happening?
[2080.74s -> 2081.14s]  I'm stuck.
[2085.35s -> 2087.50s]  Oh, stop it.
[2087.50s -> 2088.86s]  Oh, troll level.
[2088.86s -> 2089.58s]  Kaizo block.
[2090.30s -> 2092.73s]  Ready, go.
[2111.42s -> 2114.86s]  Congratulations level is complete.
[2114.86s -> 2115.42s]  Ready, go.
[2115.42s -> 2117.50s]  How are you bad at the game this easy?
[2118.54s -> 2119.58s]  I don't think you understand.
[2120.54s -> 2124.68s]  This game is very hard to control.
[2126.46s -> 2127.58s]  Have you seen my ball?
[2129.19s -> 2130.15s]  Ready, go.
[2133.18s -> 2136.22s]  It looks like it's based on physics but it's not I can assure you.
[2136.22s -> 2137.18s]  It's based off of-
[2138.06s -> 2139.50s]  I don't know.
[2139.50s -> 2147.99s]  Something else.
[2147.99s -> 2148.79s]  Got out.
[2148.79s -> 2153.98s]  Got out again.
[2159.16s -> 2159.48s]  This is-
[2165.08s -> 2165.32s]  No.
[2166.28s -> 2172.23s]  I'm fucked.
[2172.23s -> 2173.11s]  It's over.
[2173.11s -> 2182.78s]  There's no way to get up but there's no way for the player to be able to get back up.
[2183.34s -> 2184.54s]  There was a skip over there.
[2184.54s -> 2185.34s]  Oh, not again.
[2186.70s -> 2187.66s]  Ready, go.
[2198.23s -> 2200.07s]  Sorry but he's dead now.
[2200.07s -> 2200.95s]  Ready, go.
[2202.47s -> 2203.27s]  It's not easy.
[2203.91s -> 2204.55s]  It's not easy.
[2204.55s -> 2205.91s]  Trust me when I say it's not easy.
[2208.15s -> 2213.75s]  I understand that this is Serial Game number 460 but you don't-
[2215.67s -> 2219.19s]  That guy actually fell down and hit something.
[2223.11s -> 2223.83s]  Well, that was fun.
[2225.22s -> 2225.72s]  Oops.
[2226.26s -> 2226.76s]  Oops.
[2242.01s -> 2244.34s]  That was Boomer Ball.
[2244.98s -> 2246.18s]  I don't know what it was called actually.
[2246.18s -> 2246.74s]  You have no idea.
[2247.62s -> 2255.14s]  I'm not going to do the Lost Levels.
[2256.18s -> 2256.74s]  Oh come-
[2256.74s -> 2258.02s]  You want me to do the Lost Levels?
[2259.30s -> 2259.70s]  I-
[2259.70s -> 2260.10s]  Watch.
[2260.10s -> 2260.90s]  I'm going to open that.
[2260.90s -> 2263.06s]  I'm not going to be able to do it because he's going to say-
[2264.18s -> 2264.68s]  No!
[2265.06s -> 2265.54s]  No, it was-
[2265.54s -> 2266.04s]  Oops!
[2267.40s -> 2268.20s]  Fine, I'll prove it.
[2268.20s -> 2270.20s]  I'll just click on Lost Levels and he's going to say no.
[2270.76s -> 2271.72s]  Just to make sure nobody-
[2272.36s -> 2273.96s]  Because guess what's going to happen if I don't do this.
[2275.37s -> 2281.13s]  50% are going to click on Connect 4 and 50% are going to click on Lost Levels game again.
[2281.13s -> 2285.53s]  And there's going to be like four guys that actually vote for another game.
[2285.53s -> 2286.73s]  So I have to do this.
[2287.29s -> 2293.67s]  Let's go.
[2293.67s -> 2314.50s]  This is not the Lost Levels.
[2316.54s -> 2317.18s]  It's the same thing.
[2317.18s -> 2318.38s]  Ready, go.
[2318.38s -> 2319.34s]  It's the same thing.
[2320.14s -> 2321.42s]  It's not a Lost Level.
[2323.42s -> 2325.18s]  Oh, it was awful.
[2325.18s -> 2326.06s]  Ready, go.
[2327.02s -> 2344.52s]  Get the amount of space that I have to get this.
[2347.22s -> 2348.26s]  You have to do it like that.
[2355.32s -> 2356.28s]  Even one pixel.
[2356.28s -> 2376.55s]  I don't- why do you guys want me to be in this one?
[2376.55s -> 2377.11s]  Actually, you know what?
[2377.11s -> 2377.67s]  I know why.
[2377.67s -> 2381.51s]  Because it's the only one that has worked since the stream has turned on.
[2381.51s -> 2382.39s]  So I get it.
[2382.39s -> 2383.67s]  No, I do understand.
[2383.67s -> 2385.19s]  But I want to get Cartoon Mode off.
[2386.23s -> 2394.12s]  Never mind.
[2394.12s -> 2402.44s]  Graphics-wise, I really do appreciate the cell-shaded technology.
[2402.44s -> 2403.24s]  How do I get those?
[2404.20s -> 2404.84s]  Is there a jump?
[2415.19s -> 2415.69s]  Oh.
[2417.29s -> 2418.65s]  Congratulations.
[2418.65s -> 2420.57s]  Level is complete.
[2420.57s -> 2421.77s]  Ready, go.
[2421.77s -> 2422.65s]  Just jump.
[2422.65s -> 2425.35s]  Flag's over there.
[2426.63s -> 2427.91s]  Do the Lost Level.
[2427.91s -> 2434.33s]  How are these the Lost Levels?
[2436.57s -> 2438.01s]  Congratulations.
[2438.01s -> 2439.93s]  Level is complete.
[2441.61s -> 2443.13s]  Ready, go.
[2443.13s -> 2446.89s]  In my opinion, they're not lost if they're a clickable menu
[2447.61s -> 2450.33s]  in the first- when you click on Start Game.
[2452.39s -> 2454.55s]  Shouldn't this be like a sequence of events you have to do
[2454.55s -> 2456.87s]  before you get to see the Lost Levels?
[2456.87s -> 2457.99s]  They're very much found.
[2457.99s -> 2458.71s]  They're right in front of you.
[2459.67s -> 2468.01s]  It took Nintendo like 32 years to unleash the Lost Levels for Mario 1.
[2468.01s -> 2468.89s]  Congratulations.
[2468.89s -> 2469.93s]  Level is complete.
[2472.31s -> 2473.35s]  Ready, go.
[2476.34s -> 2477.78s]  Oh, you're a butcher.
[2477.78s -> 2480.34s]  Well, ready, go.
[2480.34s -> 2490.10s]  Congratulations.
[2490.10s -> 2492.10s]  Level is complete.
[2492.10s -> 2493.22s]  1048, I counted.
[2493.22s -> 2496.42s]  It's still currently- that was currently at the 10-second mark.
[2505.40s -> 2506.20s]  Oh, no.
[2508.90s -> 2509.94s]  Ready, go.
[2509.94s -> 2548.81s]  Actually, a good game.
[2548.81s -> 2550.01s]  Yeah, it was.
[2550.01s -> 2556.10s]  It's too bad it's never going to be seen again ever from this channel.
[2556.66s -> 2558.82s]  Maybe some other channel might play it and be like, nice.
[2559.54s -> 2559.94s]  Not me.
[2560.50s -> 2564.60s]  Who the hell was that?
[2564.60s -> 2565.64s]  I don't even know what that was.
[2568.12s -> 2573.00s]  One through four was right there.
[2573.00s -> 2575.56s]  Now, I appreciate the joke to try to get me to open it again.
[2576.36s -> 2578.04s]  There, look at everybody.
[2579.82s -> 2581.50s]  A full quadrant.
[2582.65s -> 2584.49s]  A full math class quadrant.
[2586.04s -> 2587.48s]  Still clicking on connect four.
[2592.78s -> 2595.34s]  Okay, now you almost got a full- you obviously had a measuring cup there.
[2595.34s -> 2597.18s]  You had a full measuring cup.
[2597.18s -> 2606.46s]  So where are we going?
[2607.26s -> 2609.88s]  Elf bowling.
[2609.88s -> 2611.00s]  Cosmic elf bowling.
[2611.00s -> 2618.30s]  Let's try it.
[2618.30s -> 2621.34s]  Cosmic- Cosmo Alley bowling.
[2623.10s -> 2624.54s]  Didn't I try this one last night?
[2624.54s -> 2625.10s]  It didn't work.
[2629.29s -> 2630.81s]  Did I forget to put one on here?
[2632.25s -> 2633.05s]  This one doesn't work.
[2634.57s -> 2635.85s]  I didn't put an X on this one.
[2641.06s -> 2641.56s]  Okay.
[2643.18s -> 2643.90s]  What's next?
[2644.46s -> 2650.09s]  Put an X on every game.
[2655.58s -> 2667.67s]  Uh, none of them have worked.
[2667.67s -> 2669.59s]  Except for the Super Monkey Ball game.
[2671.16s -> 2672.60s]  Yeah, we must have.
[2672.60s -> 2674.20s]  We're getting all landmines today.
[2675.08s -> 2677.16s]  We avoided a lot of landmines yesterday.
[2677.88s -> 2683.00s]  Surprisingly, Mega Pinball is coming up.
[2683.00s -> 2685.35s]  Let's see if it turns on.
[2685.35s -> 2690.74s]  Hey dude, you know what works, dude?
[2690.74s -> 2691.54s]  Connect four.
[2692.68s -> 2693.48s]  You're right, it does.
[2693.48s -> 2694.60s]  Connect four does work.
[2703.69s -> 2708.33s]  Okay, that's just like somebody's
[2708.33s -> 2715.53s]  engineered TF2 profile picture.
[2715.53s -> 2717.21s]  High color, true color.
[2718.97s -> 2720.33s]  Oh no, what have I done?
[2721.13s -> 2726.95s]  I clicked on true color.
[2726.95s -> 2728.15s]  Oh, I think I'm gonna blue screen.
[2728.79s -> 2729.59s]  Don't blue screen.
[2730.23s -> 2745.78s]  Damn it.
[2745.78s -> 2747.62s]  This is, okay, this is what this means.
[2748.89s -> 2750.65s]  You guys thought that this was
[2750.65s -> 2752.25s]  maximize or minimize window?
[2752.25s -> 2754.09s]  No, there are two windows.
[2754.09s -> 2756.01s]  See, there's one and then one in front,
[2756.01s -> 2757.53s]  one in front, one behind.
[2757.61s -> 2759.05s]  This is just putting the window
[2759.05s -> 2760.25s]  that's behind up front.
[2761.88s -> 2763.48s]  So it's just shuffling the two windows.
[2764.04s -> 2765.64s]  You guys thought that was minimize, maximize?
[2765.64s -> 2766.44s]  I'm sorry, you're just wrong.
[2770.82s -> 2771.70s]  Let me try to fix this.
[2771.70s -> 2773.38s]  So I need to just stretch it out a little.
[2773.94s -> 2780.95s]  So I'm gonna stretch it out
[2781.96s -> 2785.43s]  and then down like that.
[2785.43s -> 2786.55s]  Let's see if that does anything.
[2792.52s -> 2793.64s]  A little, almost.
[2797.03s -> 2798.71s]  Pinball version 1.0.
[2798.71s -> 2799.27s]  That's horseshit.
[2799.27s -> 2800.71s]  That should be 2.0
[2800.71s -> 2804.31s]  because this is version two of 700,000 games.
[2805.18s -> 2822.20s]  Oh, I got it.
[2822.20s -> 2822.44s]  I got it.
[2822.44s -> 2822.68s]  I got it.
[2822.68s -> 2822.76s]  I got it.
[2822.76s -> 2823.00s]  I got it.
[2823.00s -> 2823.32s]  I got it.
[2823.32s -> 2824.12s]  I got it.
[2824.12s -> 2825.72s]  No, that's Cosmo Alley Bowling.
[2825.72s -> 2826.20s]  Wrong one.
[2826.20s -> 2826.92s]  Mega Pinball.
[2827.64s -> 2837.61s]  That's as good as I'm gonna get it.
[2837.61s -> 2838.97s]  I can't fucking around with it anymore.
[2839.53s -> 2845.14s]  Is that even a pinball machine?
[2845.14s -> 2846.02s]  Name player one.
[2850.22s -> 2852.30s]  Damn, what's with the suit?
[2855.48s -> 2858.28s]  Pinball Mania 3D and oh,
[2858.28s -> 2860.28s]  but here's like a James Bond tuxedo.
[2860.84s -> 2863.51s]  All right, we're gonna go with this one.
[2863.51s -> 2865.27s]  This one looks like a circus one or something.
[2865.27s -> 2865.43s]  Go.
[2873.85s -> 2874.65s]  I don't, what is,
[2877.02s -> 2879.02s]  even your grandmother likes Mega Pinball.
[2879.02s -> 2879.98s]  Okay, well, how do I play?
[2880.94s -> 2888.10s]  What's flipper?
[2899.34s -> 2900.14s]  Z and X?
[2901.88s -> 2903.40s]  Oh, it's Z and,
[2905.14s -> 2906.26s]  it's Z and slash.
[2908.25s -> 2909.85s]  That sound is fucking horrible.
[2910.57s -> 2911.77s]  That's a sound I don't want to hear.
[2914.66s -> 2915.30s]  You know what I'm saying?
[2915.30s -> 2916.50s]  I don't like that sound at all.
[2916.50s -> 2917.54s]  Everybody hates that sound.
[2923.50s -> 2925.83s]  The ball is at like nine FPS.
[2928.14s -> 2928.46s]  Really?
[2929.90s -> 2940.01s]  This whole thing is a slideshow of PNGs.
[2940.49s -> 2941.45s]  There's no animation here.
[2944.49s -> 2946.25s]  Where'd it go?
[2946.25s -> 2947.05s]  Now you must, oh.
[2952.74s -> 2954.38s]  All right, listen.
[2955.72s -> 2959.08s]  When the Windows 95 space pinball machine is better
[2960.20s -> 2961.00s]  than your pinball,
[2962.23s -> 2963.51s]  that's a huge problem.
[2966.33s -> 2967.77s]  That makes me just want to play that one.
[2972.70s -> 2984.71s]  And that's, that's the Diablo 2.
[2984.71s -> 2987.03s]  I know I made a Diablo 2 reference yesterday,
[2987.03s -> 2988.55s]  but this is all about references.
[2988.55s -> 2990.23s]  These last two streams are just referencing
[2990.23s -> 2991.43s]  anything I can reference.
[2991.43s -> 2992.63s]  That's the patch.
[2993.62s -> 2994.50s]  Where's the ball?
[2994.50s -> 2997.30s]  Did the ball go down?
[2997.30s -> 2998.26s]  Was that not paying attention?
[3001.46s -> 3002.10s]  Did it go through?
[3009.59s -> 3010.39s]  Where is it?
[3010.39s -> 3028.97s]  The ball is, now it is safe to turn off your monitor.
[3028.97s -> 3029.69s]  That's scary.
[3030.25s -> 3031.53s]  That's a scary piece of text.
[3031.53s -> 3032.41s]  Is there like a tilt?
[3032.97s -> 3035.21s]  Don't some of these games have like a push or shove button?
[3035.21s -> 3035.85s]  There it is, okay.
[3036.57s -> 3043.37s]  What does it say?
[3043.37s -> 3043.85s]  What does it say?
[3043.85s -> 3045.83s]  I can't read it.
[3045.83s -> 3048.39s]  You've been warned the movie.
[3048.39s -> 3048.89s]  What?
[3049.51s -> 3051.51s]  You've been warned the, what does it say?
[3052.55s -> 3053.67s]  You've been warned.
[3056.90s -> 3059.38s]  You've been gnomed.
[3059.38s -> 3061.38s]  Move your mouse, but don't forget to play the game.
[3064.57s -> 3065.61s]  I can't do anything.
[3075.00s -> 3076.44s]  I want to see the other machine.
[3086.17s -> 3087.53s]  I love that face so much.
[3088.50s -> 3090.97s]  Uh, all right, what's next?
[3090.97s -> 3091.77s]  What do we have?
[3091.77s -> 3092.49s]  What about this one?
[3092.49s -> 3094.25s]  This is like Swampland.
[3094.25s -> 3098.36s]  This one's an alligator.
[3102.36s -> 3103.96s]  Is this one a higher, move your mouse?
[3104.60s -> 3105.80s]  I know, I know.
[3105.80s -> 3106.36s]  Shut up.
[3106.36s -> 3107.32s]  Shut up, guy.
[3108.60s -> 3110.76s]  Uh, cuckoo clock.
[3111.48s -> 3115.13s]  Anyways, what I was saying before,
[3115.93s -> 3120.89s]  if you spam the germa old emo enough times, it looks like I'm just kidding.
[3129.03s -> 3130.60s]  Does it give me a fart sound?
[3131.69s -> 3132.41s]  Better.
[3132.41s -> 3133.05s]  Yeah, it does.
[3134.09s -> 3138.82s]  I want to get it in the alligator mouth.
[3140.34s -> 3145.40s]  Get it in the alligator mouth.
[3145.40s -> 3145.90s]  Come on.
[3147.30s -> 3148.34s]  What happened?
[3148.34s -> 3153.51s]  What's this going on?
[3154.15s -> 3154.65s]  Hello?
[3156.71s -> 3157.27s]  What is it?
[3157.27s -> 3157.77s]  Now what?
[3158.63s -> 3160.63s]  Sorry, but it's your last Dan.
[3164.04s -> 3164.54s]  What?
[3175.75s -> 3177.59s]  It kicked it back into this.
[3178.15s -> 3178.65s]  How?
[3184.76s -> 3186.20s]  Oh, that was bullshit.
[3187.32s -> 3189.00s]  It actually can give you a square ball.
[3189.00s -> 3197.83s]  What?
[3197.83s -> 3199.58s]  Uh, press escape.
[3199.58s -> 3200.46s]  I'm out of here.
[3200.46s -> 3206.46s]  That was atrocious.
[3207.02s -> 3210.57s]  That was the worst game.
[3210.57s -> 3212.01s]  I don't even care the ones that don't work.
[3212.01s -> 3213.53s]  That was worse than the ones that don't work.
[3214.09s -> 3219.27s]  I'm going to keep the screen there for now.
[3226.02s -> 3226.90s]  Mega pinball.
[3227.54s -> 3243.10s]  Here we go.
[3243.10s -> 3246.94s]  Make my desktop background tiles of the snort witch.
[3247.66s -> 3249.96s]  Now that's going to give me a headache.
[3249.96s -> 3252.28s]  You don't think that'll give you a headache after like 20 minutes?
[3256.57s -> 3257.53s]  Tuxedo level.
[3257.53s -> 3258.97s]  I can't select the tuxedo.
[3258.97s -> 3260.81s]  The tuxedo is unselectable.
[3260.81s -> 3263.05s]  It's just there for flair and for fluff.
[3268.49s -> 3271.82s]  All right, so why do some of these not have percentages?
[3274.31s -> 3275.19s]  Magic Spears.
[3275.75s -> 3284.49s]  Jerma can't even beat the first level of Starcraft.
[3285.70s -> 3286.26s]  Yes, I can.
[3288.89s -> 3289.69s]  You start out.
[3290.25s -> 3291.85s]  You're in the castle.
[3292.73s -> 3295.77s]  And I got to cleanse all the grain.
[3295.77s -> 3298.65s]  The grain is all dirty and it's making people get the plague.
[3298.65s -> 3300.33s]  So you got to cleanse the people from the plague.
[3303.02s -> 3305.34s]  The culling of Stratholme.
[3306.07s -> 3306.71s]  I remember that.
[3306.71s -> 3307.51s]  It's the first level.
[3307.51s -> 3313.43s]  I know it.
[3313.43s -> 3315.19s]  That's not a WoW reference.
[3315.19s -> 3317.03s]  That is a Warcraft reference.
[3317.03s -> 3318.95s]  Not a World of Warcraft reference.
[3318.95s -> 3321.19s]  It's a Warcraft reference.
[3321.19s -> 3322.07s]  All right, this one works.
[3328.54s -> 3329.26s]  Always check.
[3329.90s -> 3336.17s]  Are you kidding me?
[3336.17s -> 3337.21s]  It's the first game ever.
[3337.21s -> 3338.65s]  Oh, and it's got full screen?
[3338.65s -> 3339.21s]  Kidding me.
[3339.77s -> 3340.25s]  Kidding me.
[3349.94s -> 3351.06s]  You got to be kidding me.
[3351.06s -> 3351.62s]  Thank God.
[3353.11s -> 3356.87s]  The only game in the goddamn pack that allows you to do this.
[3357.51s -> 3365.86s]  And it's got sliders.
[3366.58s -> 3367.46s]  It's got a gamma.
[3368.10s -> 3368.98s]  Landscape quality.
[3369.78s -> 3372.28s]  What is this even changing?
[3373.32s -> 3379.37s]  Well, I don't understand what that's doing.
[3381.99s -> 3382.79s]  Fog type.
[3382.79s -> 3384.15s]  Table or vertex.
[3385.83s -> 3388.71s]  On some old video cards, table fog may look strange.
[3388.71s -> 3390.07s]  Switching to vertex fog.
[3395.00s -> 3395.72s]  Turn up the mute.
[3395.72s -> 3396.84s]  That's just render distance.
[3397.48s -> 3398.36s]  All right, we're ready.
[3399.32s -> 3400.68s]  Welcome to Magic Spheres.
[3401.88s -> 3403.32s]  I'm actually really excited for this.
[3403.32s -> 3404.60s]  Start adventure.
[3404.60s -> 3405.48s]  Screen saver.
[3406.20s -> 3410.42s]  The one I didn't do this.
[3411.30s -> 3416.73s]  I don't like this.
[3416.73s -> 3417.93s]  I don't like how this is doing this.
[3417.93s -> 3419.13s]  This is fucking scaring me.
[3420.25s -> 3426.09s]  This is the best game so far.
[3427.93s -> 3432.33s]  Once upon a time in the blessed country of Tyroding.
[3432.97s -> 3435.53s]  Good and evil locked horns in eternal combat.
[3436.17s -> 3437.85s]  The evil wizard, Catalyne,
[3437.85s -> 3441.69s]  Stolen and imprisoned in fragile magical spheres.
[3441.69s -> 3442.81s]  Souls of the righteous.
[3443.62s -> 3446.34s]  If they're not released before the hour of the wolf,
[3446.34s -> 3449.14s]  the souls will become subjected to the mighty villain
[3449.14s -> 3452.02s]  and Tyroding will vanish into oblivion.
[3452.66s -> 3456.66s]  There's only one sorcerer who's equal in strength to Carolyte.
[3456.66s -> 3458.49s]  Young player.
[3458.49s -> 3462.81s]  Luckily, player dared to throw out a challenge to the wicked magician
[3462.81s -> 3465.69s]  and Carolyte offered to play the game.
[3465.69s -> 3469.93s]  In which souls are the tokens and the Tyroding is the game board.
[3469.93s -> 3470.49s]  So be it.
[3471.13s -> 3473.53s]  The battle will take place atop squally mountains
[3474.09s -> 3477.45s]  and the stake in the game is the future of our magical world.
[3481.32s -> 3482.28s]  Oh, come on.
[3482.28s -> 3482.68s]  No.
[3482.68s -> 3482.92s]  What?
[3483.64s -> 3483.88s]  No.
[3484.92s -> 3487.72s]  Ah, it's this.
[3492.04s -> 3493.96s]  I'm actually, like, upset about this.
[3499.26s -> 3501.58s]  Such an epic journey we just went on.
[3502.30s -> 3508.38s]  Of the imprisoned souls, people that play Candy Crush every day
[3508.38s -> 3510.38s]  and we have to, like, fucking take their iPads from them.
[3511.90s -> 3516.76s]  This is what happens when you play Candy Crush.
[3516.76s -> 3519.56s]  For, like, fucking 12 hours a day and you spend, like, four grand.
[3520.20s -> 3521.64s]  You turn into a cube
[3521.64s -> 3525.16s]  and then you have to get sucked up from a marble vacuum.
[3526.12s -> 3540.97s]  Release all souls before the timer.
[3540.97s -> 3542.01s]  All right, I can get this shit.
[3543.45s -> 3546.68s]  Close.
[3549.29s -> 3550.65s]  This ain't a real match three game.
[3550.65s -> 3553.13s]  Square always works and it turns into a fucking bomb.
[3555.43s -> 3572.55s]  What have I got?
[3573.43s -> 3575.21s]  Got it.
[3575.21s -> 3579.99s]  That's its thermometer.
[3579.99s -> 3581.03s]  That's how odd I was.
[3581.99s -> 3584.60s]  Souls released.
[3584.60s -> 3585.24s]  Click anywhere.
[3585.88s -> 3589.59s]  For each level completed, you've received one upgrade point.
[3589.59s -> 3591.03s]  You can spend it on upgrades.
[3591.91s -> 3595.45s]  Click the plus button to purchase an upgrade
[3595.45s -> 3597.13s]  to sell an upgrade and get upgrade points back.
[3597.13s -> 3598.17s]  Click the minus button.
[3599.13s -> 3602.95s]  This every will allow up to five souls on the screen at one time.
[3602.95s -> 3603.91s]  It's now only four.
[3603.91s -> 3605.03s]  This is a skill tree.
[3606.34s -> 3607.06s]  Low level bonus.
[3607.06s -> 3610.50s]  Make a row of four spheres to get this bonus.
[3610.50s -> 3612.74s]  When activated, this bonus destroys nearby spheres.
[3613.70s -> 3617.37s]  Yeah, that's what I was talking about.
[3619.96s -> 3621.08s]  Well done.
[3621.16s -> 3624.44s]  Don't forget that the stake in this game is the innocent souls.
[3624.44s -> 3626.52s]  Break the spell of carolite.
[3626.52s -> 3628.76s]  The earth is too small for magic.
[3628.76s -> 3633.80s]  Carolite's black serpent and your white swan have soared skyward.
[3633.80s -> 3635.88s]  The wizard has placed the first game board
[3635.88s -> 3638.04s]  with souls above a peaceful meadow,
[3638.04s -> 3640.20s]  smelling of honey and white flowers.
[3641.96s -> 3645.24s]  All that Great Britain dialogue for this.
[3649.21s -> 3650.41s]  Yeah, see, it makes a bomb.
[3651.13s -> 3659.46s]  Now this is what I'm talking about.
[3662.20s -> 3665.42s]  The next time I do it, bingo.
[3666.14s -> 3667.90s]  We got another row of four.
[3667.90s -> 3668.78s]  Boom.
[3668.78s -> 3669.18s]  Bomb.
[3669.18s -> 3669.82s]  Explode.
[3669.82s -> 3670.22s]  Bomb.
[3670.22s -> 3670.70s]  Explode.
[3671.66s -> 3673.40s]  Go ahead and do it at this one.
[3673.40s -> 3673.72s]  Boom.
[3675.64s -> 3683.88s]  Pretty good, huh?
[3685.08s -> 3686.76s]  Let's see.
[3686.76s -> 3687.16s]  Let's see.
[3689.59s -> 3693.77s]  How many souls do I have?
[3700.42s -> 3702.26s]  I don't feel like I'm going to play this one for a little while.
[3702.98s -> 3703.86s]  This one's like fun.
[3705.30s -> 3718.12s]  The halos of the souls.
[3718.12s -> 3719.08s]  Okay, I need two more.
[3719.96s -> 3722.44s]  Each successful move fills up your status bar.
[3723.24s -> 3725.32s]  You need to fill the bar to activate perfect mode.
[3726.28s -> 3734.34s]  I need one insane strung together moment
[3734.34s -> 3736.34s]  where I get like a hundred thousand points.
[3737.46s -> 3749.60s]  Yeah!
[3750.30s -> 3750.80s]  Yeah!
[3752.20s -> 3752.76s]  I was...
[3752.76s -> 3754.12s]  No, don't scream.
[3754.12s -> 3754.44s]  Come on.
[3754.44s -> 3755.24s]  You're too old for that.
[3756.28s -> 3768.52s]  Got two minutes left?
[3772.22s -> 3773.18s]  Oh, check this out.
[3773.18s -> 3773.68s]  Ready?
[3775.85s -> 3779.05s]  I couldn't catch it.
[3780.28s -> 3780.60s]  All right.
[3781.56s -> 3782.84s]  Oh, we're getting a double here.
[3782.84s -> 3783.40s]  Watch this.
[3783.40s -> 3783.96s]  Oh, I'm ready.
[3783.96s -> 3784.28s]  I'm ready.
[3784.28s -> 3784.60s]  I'm ready.
[3784.60s -> 3784.92s]  I'm ready.
[3784.92s -> 3785.16s]  Ready.
[3785.16s -> 3785.56s]  Check it out.
[3785.56s -> 3785.80s]  Ready.
[3785.80s -> 3786.60s]  Bang.
[3786.60s -> 3787.32s]  Bang.
[3787.32s -> 3787.80s]  Bang.
[3787.80s -> 3788.20s]  Oh, wait.
[3788.20s -> 3817.02s]  There's a halo.
[3817.58s -> 3819.88s]  I need green down here.
[3823.56s -> 3824.28s]  Come on.
[3824.28s -> 3827.16s]  Come on, chat.
[3827.16s -> 3827.96s]  Give me your energy.
[3829.40s -> 3829.96s]  Watch this.
[3839.05s -> 3840.41s]  65 degrees Celsius.
[3840.41s -> 3841.13s]  That's pretty cool.
[3845.21s -> 3845.93s]  Lightning sequence.
[3845.93s -> 3848.17s]  Make rows of spheres of the same type,
[3848.17s -> 3850.33s]  one after another to activate a special effect.
[3851.05s -> 3854.10s]  To get a high level bonus,
[3854.10s -> 3856.10s]  you have to make a row of five spheres.
[3856.74s -> 3857.24s]  Yeah.
[3858.81s -> 3859.31s]  Uh-huh.
[3860.01s -> 3862.63s]  Bless it is your way, young wizard.
[3862.63s -> 3863.91s]  Do one more good deed.
[3863.91s -> 3866.07s]  Save 15 souls in prison here.
[3867.83s -> 3871.67s]  Is this too loud?
[3872.23s -> 3875.00s]  The five.
[3875.00s -> 3877.16s]  I remember the five makes like the rainbow sphere
[3877.16s -> 3879.00s]  and it takes away all the same color.
[3880.71s -> 3883.96s]  Yep.
[3883.96s -> 3884.46s]  Yep.
[3885.24s -> 3887.56s]  Get all the gray ones.
[3887.56s -> 3889.11s]  That's a terrible bonus.
[3889.91s -> 3892.39s]  This shit's too loud.
[3893.19s -> 3896.89s]  So don't fuck with that.
[3897.45s -> 3900.98s]  I like this one.
[3900.98s -> 3901.30s]  All right.
[3901.30s -> 3901.94s]  How many souls?
[3901.94s -> 3902.42s]  15.
[3902.42s -> 3903.54s]  15 souls is what we need.
[3904.34s -> 3906.04s]  Oh, my God.
[3906.92s -> 3911.61s]  Okay.
[3911.61s -> 3912.33s]  How many more do I need?
[3912.33s -> 3912.73s]  15.
[3912.73s -> 3913.21s]  15.
[3913.21s -> 3913.71s]  Get it.
[3914.43s -> 3922.65s]  You might, it might sound crazy,
[3922.65s -> 3924.65s]  but I would pay like $1.50 for this one.
[3928.22s -> 3928.86s]  Perfect mode.
[3929.42s -> 3934.67s]  Come on.
[3934.67s -> 3935.63s]  This is perfect mode.
[3939.76s -> 3940.32s]  Holy shit.
[3941.12s -> 3948.09s]  Oh, dude.
[3948.81s -> 3949.31s]  Dude.
[3955.34s -> 3956.94s]  You paid $11 for it.
[3956.94s -> 3958.22s]  Yeah, but I'd pay a dollar like,
[3958.22s -> 3961.26s]  I pay like two, probably like $6 for this one.
[3961.26s -> 3976.88s]  What do I have right now?
[3976.88s -> 3982.16s]  I need that five in a row.
[3984.75s -> 3985.39s]  It was worth it.
[3985.39s -> 3986.03s]  It was worth it.
[3986.03s -> 3986.91s]  Look, I'm telling you,
[3986.91s -> 3988.27s]  I'm gonna get a cube one eventually here.
[3990.43s -> 3990.93s]  Got it.
[3995.40s -> 3998.72s]  You are what's wrong with kids today.
[4001.39s -> 4001.89s]  What?
[4002.43s -> 4002.93s]  Why?
[4003.63s -> 4007.84s]  How could I be what?
[4009.52s -> 4011.12s]  I'm playing like an old game.
[4011.84s -> 4012.75s]  All right.
[4012.75s -> 4013.31s]  What's this one?
[4014.49s -> 4016.33s]  Make a row of four to get this bonus.
[4016.33s -> 4017.21s]  It calls it so that you need,
[4017.21s -> 4018.41s]  this is a row of four.
[4021.36s -> 4022.56s]  No, wait.
[4022.56s -> 4024.16s]  They're both rows, not columns.
[4025.80s -> 4026.76s]  Mining sequence.
[4029.20s -> 4032.32s]  Yeah.
[4032.32s -> 4033.28s]  I think I want, hmm.
[4038.01s -> 4039.69s]  I'm gonna, I want more spirits on the screen.
[4039.69s -> 4040.65s]  Why is this so in-depth?
[4040.65s -> 4042.89s]  Do you want to take a break after this brilliant success?
[4043.37s -> 4045.13s]  Draw a deep breath and continue.
[4045.13s -> 4047.13s]  20 souls are waiting for you to release them.
[4048.64s -> 4050.64s]  Even, people are gonna get mad if I don't finish this.
[4050.64s -> 4052.96s]  Even though the mountains are snow-capped,
[4052.96s -> 4055.60s]  the struggle for the innocent souls of the future of
[4055.60s -> 4057.76s]  Tiroding becomes even hotter.
[4057.76s -> 4059.36s]  I told you I was talking about how hot I was.
[4061.98s -> 4062.62s]  Level two, one.
[4062.62s -> 4064.30s]  I'm gonna beat this game on stream.
[4065.98s -> 4078.78s]  Please actually win this one.
[4079.58s -> 4084.16s]  I actually beat this one?
[4085.76s -> 4086.32s]  It's fun.
[4086.32s -> 4087.20s]  I'm having a good time.
[4088.64s -> 4090.20s]  It's such a simple game.
[4091.56s -> 4092.12s]  Come on.
[4092.12s -> 4092.36s]  Come on.
[4092.36s -> 4094.20s]  I need that, I need that perfect bonus.
[4096.27s -> 4096.99s]  Did I fuck it up?
[4096.99s -> 4097.39s]  Not yet.
[4097.39s -> 4098.19s]  Hold on.
[4098.19s -> 4099.47s]  Oh wait, it's a one, two, three, four.
[4100.43s -> 4101.96s]  It's all right.
[4103.08s -> 4104.12s]  Perfect bonus incoming.
[4111.61s -> 4112.73s]  This is so exciting.
[4113.84s -> 4114.56s]  Uh-oh.
[4114.56s -> 4115.04s]  Uh-oh.
[4116.64s -> 4116.80s]  Fine.
[4116.80s -> 4123.40s]  Give me some blue.
[4125.00s -> 4130.91s]  Um.
[4130.91s -> 4137.71s]  Uh.
[4137.71s -> 4139.69s]  Uh, this way.
[4139.69s -> 4141.60s]  Activate this.
[4142.32s -> 4142.80s]  Check it out.
[4143.52s -> 4144.16s]  Activate that.
[4145.60s -> 4152.72s]  The red one's bad.
[4155.42s -> 4162.51s]  It's like, why don't I just play Bejeweled?
[4162.51s -> 4163.31s]  That's like the good one.
[4164.03s -> 4164.51s]  This one's good.
[4164.51s -> 4165.95s]  Bejeweled doesn't have upgrade points.
[4177.74s -> 4178.78s]  Bad move.
[4178.78s -> 4179.50s]  Bad move.
[4189.66s -> 4191.18s]  Okay, I'm gonna try to get rid of as many
[4192.38s -> 4192.70s]  soul.
[4192.70s -> 4194.14s]  I got four more souls to free.
[4195.18s -> 4199.40s]  I'm kind of getting
[4200.12s -> 4200.52s]  over here.
[4202.04s -> 4203.55s]  Go right here.
[4203.55s -> 4203.87s]  Five.
[4203.87s -> 4204.19s]  Got it.
[4205.47s -> 4205.87s]  Do it.
[4207.79s -> 4210.68s]  Come on.
[4211.48s -> 4213.00s]  Ah, I had an opportunity to do that.
[4213.00s -> 4214.68s]  I'm just, it's perfect mode, so I'm freaking out.
[4226.00s -> 4227.28s]  Just five, five, five, five, five.
[4235.32s -> 4236.52s]  Two more souls in a minute.
[4237.08s -> 4255.72s]  Come on, upgrade point.
[4255.72s -> 4258.62s]  Where's it going?
[4258.62s -> 4259.34s]  Time shift.
[4259.90s -> 4262.54s]  Two rows of spheres of the same type, one after another.
[4263.42s -> 4265.26s]  That gives you 45 additional seconds.
[4266.14s -> 4267.98s]  This is the, make a row of four.
[4267.98s -> 4268.94s]  This is the vertical one.
[4270.64s -> 4273.28s]  Or do I want, yeah, I want the vertical one.
[4274.24s -> 4276.24s]  Vertical one's good.
[4281.95s -> 4284.19s]  Anybody else find it funny that every single level
[4284.83s -> 4288.67s]  going forward, the text gets smaller and smaller?
[4289.47s -> 4293.02s]  That was a huge bunch of stuff to read.
[4293.02s -> 4295.82s]  And then it's like, oh, and then a little bit of that.
[4295.82s -> 4297.66s]  One more problem to solve, but the villain is tireless.
[4297.66s -> 4298.94s]  You need to release 25 souls.
[4299.58s -> 4303.71s]  They had an elaborate, the problem over the
[4303.71s -> 4308.11s]  snowy mountain caps and through the treacherous dirt.
[4308.11s -> 4309.55s]  No, I don't care anymore.
[4325.42s -> 4326.62s]  I like this one.
[4326.62s -> 4329.34s]  I unironically think this game is fun.
[4329.90s -> 4332.03s]  I really do.
[4332.75s -> 4333.55s]  It's weird to say.
[4334.35s -> 4338.24s]  Let me think about this.
[4338.24s -> 4339.20s]  I got a minute.
[4339.20s -> 4343.63s]  It's because you're a casual.
[4345.15s -> 4350.68s]  Oh, this would be the last one.
[4350.68s -> 4351.64s]  I'll do this one off stream.
[4351.64s -> 4352.76s]  I'll play this one for like an hour.
[4358.01s -> 4359.61s]  It's Candy Crush with upgrade points.
[4364.04s -> 4368.28s]  Here's the difference though.
[4368.28s -> 4373.20s]  Candy Crush is a total horseshit video game.
[4374.16s -> 4377.76s]  And all the iPad match three games follow the same formula.
[4377.76s -> 4380.64s]  And that formula is the games are free to download.
[4381.60s -> 4384.88s]  But after about 25 levels, the levels become
[4384.88s -> 4386.56s]  nearly impossible to complete.
[4388.81s -> 4391.29s]  Unless you buy their little booster upgrades
[4391.29s -> 4394.09s]  to blow up a row that you could not get before.
[4394.09s -> 4397.29s]  So you have to spend like a dollar per little
[4397.29s -> 4399.69s]  axe that you can knock one of those blocks out with.
[4400.97s -> 4406.36s]  And every level after that is the same way.
[4408.73s -> 4419.82s]  Oh, we're in perfect mode.
[4419.82s -> 4420.32s]  Hold on.
[4420.94s -> 4431.60s]  Like anybody actually cares that we're in perfect mode right now.
[4432.24s -> 4434.84s]  Like, I'm going to look over here and see everybody going like,
[4434.84s -> 4435.88s]  oh, nice.
[4435.88s -> 4436.28s]  Whoa.
[4436.28s -> 4436.84s]  Cool, man.
[4443.16s -> 4444.12s]  I'm missing so many.
[4444.12s -> 4445.08s]  It's because I started talking.
[4459.96s -> 4460.44s]  Blow it up.
[4462.20s -> 4464.54s]  Fiver right there.
[4466.36s -> 4467.96s]  Oh, and it's a fiver into a four.
[4469.00s -> 4472.84s]  Into another four.
[4476.17s -> 4481.32s]  Bring it.
[4481.32s -> 4491.21s]  Oh, let's see what the text is like this time.
[4491.21s -> 4492.65s]  And I will move on after this one.
[4492.65s -> 4493.05s]  All right.
[4493.05s -> 4494.25s]  I have two upgrade points.
[4495.29s -> 4508.16s]  My magic book says you'll need to deliberate 30 souls.
[4508.16s -> 4510.80s]  But don't forget to use the magic gifts such as adding time.
[4515.08s -> 4516.04s]  I have to stop.
[4516.92s -> 4518.12s]  I have to stop doing this.
[4519.42s -> 4519.66s]  Right?
[4524.41s -> 4525.13s]  You have initiated.
[4529.05s -> 4530.09s]  So the same color.
[4531.53s -> 4533.77s]  And then I get plus 1500.
[4533.77s -> 4534.89s]  That's a lot of points.
[4548.22s -> 4550.22s]  You have hundreds of games to play.
[4550.22s -> 4551.02s]  That's true.
[4551.02s -> 4552.78s]  We can't get addicted to one of these.
[4553.58s -> 4554.08s]  What's this?
[4554.62s -> 4555.64s]  What does it want me to do?
[4556.60s -> 4557.56s]  How do you match this one?
[4557.56s -> 4559.16s]  You just match in between?
[4560.12s -> 4567.39s]  All right.
[4567.39s -> 4567.95s]  This will be the last.
[4567.95s -> 4570.35s]  Could we do have like another 150 games to play?
[4570.35s -> 4571.31s]  So this will be the last one.
[4572.11s -> 4573.16s]  That's it.
[4573.16s -> 4573.66s]  One more.
[4586.57s -> 4587.13s]  Time slow.
[4588.41s -> 4588.91s]  Nice.
[4590.01s -> 4591.45s]  There's a double angel here.
[4593.45s -> 4594.25s]  Don't worry about it.
[4594.25s -> 4594.89s]  Just get what you need.
[4595.69s -> 4596.49s]  Yeah, we need to get out.
[4605.79s -> 4611.79s]  I need to get like a huge explosion.
[4611.79s -> 4615.15s]  Where it's just like a string of like 30 things happening.
[4617.79s -> 4621.98s]  It's close.
[4633.82s -> 4636.03s]  Come on.
[4636.49s -> 4637.68s]  Let's see it.
[4637.68s -> 4638.18s]  Come on.
[4642.08s -> 4642.58s]  No!
[4642.58s -> 4643.60s]  That was supposed to go the other way.
[4643.60s -> 4644.10s]  Damn it.
[4644.72s -> 4645.52s]  What an idiot.
[4656.43s -> 4656.99s]  Blew it again.
[4656.99s -> 4657.55s]  No, I didn't.
[4657.55s -> 4659.07s]  I was perfectly thought out.
[4661.39s -> 4661.89s]  God.
[4669.04s -> 4677.87s]  Why did I do that?
[4682.38s -> 4685.90s]  We're never going to get to see the crazy sequence, are we?
[4686.70s -> 4688.88s]  That's all I care about.
[4690.43s -> 4691.63s]  It just scratches my brain.
[4702.84s -> 4703.96s]  All right, we have four.
[4703.96s -> 4709.32s]  Four into six more.
[4709.32s -> 4710.04s]  Where are they?
[4710.04s -> 4710.68s]  Two down here.
[4712.20s -> 4712.92s]  Two blues.
[4712.92s -> 4714.20s]  That should line it up nicely.
[4714.20s -> 4715.40s]  That should line it up nicely.
[4717.44s -> 4718.16s]  Not really though.
[4718.16s -> 4718.66s]  Hold on.
[4740.33s -> 4741.05s]  I blew it.
[4745.02s -> 4745.82s]  He blew it.
[4746.62s -> 4747.18s]  Did I though?
[4755.79s -> 4756.43s]  They're down here.
[4757.31s -> 4759.29s]  Just got to bring some grays down there.
[4759.85s -> 4760.73s]  And some yellows.
[4761.37s -> 4761.77s]  And what?
[4761.77s -> 4762.33s]  I got a minute?
[4762.33s -> 4763.85s]  I got a minute to figure this out.
[4763.85s -> 4764.35s]  All right.
[4796.65s -> 4796.97s]  Nice.
[4796.97s -> 4797.45s]  More money.
[4804.49s -> 4804.99s]  All right.
[4805.37s -> 4806.70s]  That's it.
[4806.70s -> 4808.54s]  It isn't time to admire the scenery.
[4808.54s -> 4811.02s]  35 souls is what it's going to keep going up.
[4811.02s -> 4811.58s]  So this is it.
[4811.58s -> 4812.08s]  That's it.
[4814.65s -> 4815.45s]  This is the last one.
[4825.95s -> 4826.27s]  Five.
[4826.27s -> 4826.75s]  Got it.
[4828.27s -> 4829.15s]  Come on.
[4829.15s -> 4830.27s]  I got to keep it stringing together.
[4831.63s -> 4832.27s]  Five again.
[4832.27s -> 4832.83s]  Got it again.
[4832.83s -> 4834.27s]  Two fives on the board now.
[4834.27s -> 4835.47s]  Two fives on the board, ladies and gentlemen.
[4835.47s -> 4836.35s]  You see what's happening here?
[4836.91s -> 4839.07s]  I'm queuing up like five fives.
[4839.07s -> 4840.75s]  And it's going to explode the whole thing.
[4840.75s -> 4842.75s]  And I can finally move on from this addiction.
[4842.75s -> 4843.79s]  I can finally get out of here.
[4849.04s -> 4849.54s]  One.
[4852.14s -> 4852.62s]  No.
[4852.62s -> 4853.34s]  I fucked it up.
[4858.17s -> 4859.37s]  Why do I keep doing this?
[4862.08s -> 4863.36s]  Resident sleeper.
[4864.00s -> 4864.72s]  I know.
[4864.72s -> 4865.20s]  Trust me.
[4865.20s -> 4868.72s]  I'm very well aware of how resident sleeper this is probably.
[4869.44s -> 4871.28s]  But I need to follow through.
[4873.92s -> 4881.00s]  You guys see what's happening here?
[4881.00s -> 4882.35s]  You guys see what's happening?
[4889.39s -> 4893.97s]  Reds.
[4894.51s -> 4907.50s]  Up to 35 yellows right here.
[4909.66s -> 4919.76s]  All right.
[4919.76s -> 4920.26s]  Good.
[4922.04s -> 4922.68s]  Had it before.
[4930.48s -> 4931.68s]  Perfect mode activated.
[4938.32s -> 4939.04s]  Oh, got it.
[4948.56s -> 4950.08s]  Zeus is taking over my body right now.
[4950.08s -> 4950.96s]  He's making all these plays.
[4952.64s -> 4963.21s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[4963.21s -> 4973.68s]  Come on.
[4973.68s -> 4974.18s]  Get.
[4979.37s -> 4985.26s]  I have to do it.
[4985.26s -> 4986.38s]  I don't want it, but I have to get it.
[4988.06s -> 4988.54s]  There we go.
[4988.54s -> 5000.25s]  That's exactly what I'm looking for.
[5000.25s -> 5003.37s]  I didn't even do the thing that it wanted me to do.
[5005.29s -> 5016.94s]  What's next?
[5016.94s -> 5017.26s]  Up here.
[5018.06s -> 5018.70s]  Not anymore.
[5018.70s -> 5019.74s]  13 more?
[5027.52s -> 5028.02s]  Double.
[5042.08s -> 5049.74s]  Sure.
[5049.74s -> 5068.27s]  Take double time, bro.
[5068.27s -> 5068.91s]  All right.
[5068.91s -> 5069.55s]  I'll stop.
[5069.55s -> 5070.91s]  I promise.
[5070.91s -> 5071.87s]  After this, I'm done.
[5081.23s -> 5088.09s]  Which one?
[5088.09s -> 5088.57s]  This one?
[5088.57s -> 5089.07s]  Yep.
[5091.37s -> 5094.59s]  Ended on a good note.
[5103.90s -> 5105.10s]  Do I even have any halos?
[5105.90s -> 5106.64s]  I don't.
[5107.34s -> 5112.96s]  Where's the last halo?
[5112.96s -> 5114.00s]  What's over here?
[5114.00s -> 5119.95s]  Complete the whole game.
[5120.75s -> 5121.55s]  I can't do that.
[5122.43s -> 5130.12s]  Why is it not ending?
[5130.12s -> 5131.00s]  Oh, there we go.
[5131.00s -> 5139.37s]  All right.
[5139.37s -> 5141.77s]  So your wisdom is years beyond your age.
[5141.77s -> 5142.25s]  Use it to...
[5142.25s -> 5142.57s]  All right.
[5142.57s -> 5144.41s]  Let's do this.
[5144.41s -> 5145.37s]  It's a joke.
[5145.37s -> 5145.85s]  I'm kidding.
[5146.49s -> 5155.26s]  That was really good.
[5155.26s -> 5156.46s]  That was really fun.
[5156.46s -> 5160.91s]  It's the longest we spent in one the whole entire time.
[5160.91s -> 5173.42s]  Oh, no.
[5177.61s -> 5179.69s]  53, 54% of you guys
[5180.80s -> 5182.00s]  are going up and down here.
[5186.32s -> 5192.57s]  Gems of Amazon is currently in first place,
[5192.57s -> 5193.93s]  but not by very much.
[5195.13s -> 5195.69s]  All right.
[5195.69s -> 5197.61s]  What is that one over there?
[5198.33s -> 5206.70s]  This is just another match three game.
[5207.50s -> 5208.22s]  Oh, I'm like...
[5208.94s -> 5211.00s]  It's all right.
[5211.00s -> 5218.43s]  Gems of the Amazon is on here twice.
[5219.07s -> 5223.60s]  Okay.
[5223.60s -> 5225.68s]  Well, here's Gems of the Amazon.
[5226.24s -> 5228.94s]  Thank you for voting.
[5236.08s -> 5238.32s]  Oh, that's unfortunate.
[5239.04s -> 5240.44s]  Gems of the Amazon doesn't...
[5240.44s -> 5248.41s]  Oh, it doesn't open.
[5248.41s -> 5248.89s]  Saved.
[5249.45s -> 5265.29s]  Click on the other one.
[5270.25s -> 5271.77s]  I can't find it too.
[5273.08s -> 5273.48s]  All right.
[5273.48s -> 5274.28s]  I'll try it.
[5274.28s -> 5275.24s]  Let's try the other one.
[5283.92s -> 5294.24s]  Gems of the Amazon also does not open.
[5299.13s -> 5301.61s]  Both Gems of the Amazon don't open.
[5301.61s -> 5315.48s]  If you're going to have it on there twice,
[5315.48s -> 5318.28s]  at least have one of them open.
[5318.28s -> 5319.56s]  Well, one of them work.
[5319.56s -> 5325.45s]  What the hell is that?
[5325.45s -> 5325.69s]  Okay.
[5325.69s -> 5326.65s]  I already got it.
[5326.65s -> 5337.12s]  What is this one?
[5337.12s -> 5339.47s]  I don't know what you guys are looking at here.
[5340.46s -> 5341.18s]  Something popper?
[5344.32s -> 5345.76s]  35% for...
[5346.48s -> 5348.48s]  Which one is that?
[5348.48s -> 5351.92s]  That's Teapot Poppers.
[5355.08s -> 5357.48s]  Let's give Teapot Poppers a try.
[5357.48s -> 5369.48s]  Here we go.
[5369.48s -> 5374.12s]  See if I can fix the video settings.
[5378.59s -> 5379.71s]  Yeah, this is Teapot Poppers.
[5379.71s -> 5381.15s]  A lot of people have been waiting for this one.
[5381.15s -> 5392.76s]  This music.
[5410.76s -> 5428.08s]  This is a regular Nintendo song.
[5428.08s -> 5428.48s]  Let's try it.
[5428.48s -> 5429.12s]  I'll restart it.
[5429.76s -> 5433.21s]  That's Snake, Rattle, and Roll's theme song.
[5433.21s -> 5436.25s]  I've said that like 12 times over the last seven years,
[5436.25s -> 5437.29s]  and it never is the case.
[5442.84s -> 5443.56s]  All right.
[5443.56s -> 5443.88s]  Nice.
[5444.60s -> 5445.50s]  We're good.
[5446.14s -> 5447.58s]  And it opens in full screen.
[5447.58s -> 5448.22s]  Would you look at that?
[5460.32s -> 5460.88s]  Let's hear it.
[5461.44s -> 5466.03s]  What's the music?
[5471.69s -> 5472.41s]  Where's the sound?
[5473.21s -> 5496.96s]  Oh, okay.
[5498.83s -> 5500.19s]  Your cannon is near the camera,
[5500.19s -> 5503.39s]  so you scan, shoot anywhere.
[5504.92s -> 5506.36s]  Bounce your ball off of objects
[5506.36s -> 5508.12s]  to reach balls that are otherwise inaccessible.
[5508.12s -> 5510.60s]  This is just a snood, right?
[5511.72s -> 5515.71s]  Buster Balls.
[5515.87s -> 5516.35s]  What's it called?
[5516.99s -> 5522.65s]  Oh, the ball.
[5522.65s -> 5523.53s]  This is just power-ups.
[5526.89s -> 5527.61s]  All right.
[5527.61s -> 5528.09s]  Sure thing.
[5528.81s -> 5535.45s]  What the hell am I looking at here?
[5535.45s -> 5536.81s]  I don't know what you're eating,
[5536.81s -> 5538.33s]  but it's definitely burnt.
[5539.64s -> 5541.80s]  You left it in the oven for a little too long, I think.
[5542.91s -> 5544.75s]  That may have been a casserole at one point.
[5550.60s -> 5552.28s]  No, it is just Zuma.
[5552.28s -> 5558.19s]  That wasn't right.
[5558.83s -> 5571.02s]  No, it's because the objects.
[5571.02s -> 5574.86s]  This is not just there for fun.
[5575.58s -> 5583.84s]  Careful, guys.
[5585.26s -> 5588.46s]  These might start talking and singing songs about the house.
[5589.50s -> 5591.34s]  Like, really, at least.
[5592.14s -> 5597.44s]  It's horrible.
[5608.38s -> 5609.18s]  I'll do the sounds.
[5609.18s -> 5609.68s]  Fine.
[5673.52s -> 5677.45s]  I gotta get a string.
[5678.01s -> 5692.64s]  Awesome.
[5693.74s -> 5704.85s]  Cool.
[5713.50s -> 5714.38s]  Failure.
[5714.38s -> 5761.98s]  Working.
[5761.98s -> 5769.92s]  This music overlapping itself.
[5770.56s -> 5793.12s]  No, no, no.
[5795.48s -> 5820.12s]  Where we going?
[5820.12s -> 5826.11s]  Cool.
[5828.27s -> 5828.77s]  Frenzy.
[5839.71s -> 5840.67s]  It's pretty even.
[5840.67s -> 5843.37s]  What's up there?
[5843.37s -> 5845.21s]  I don't know how to play solitaire,
[5845.21s -> 5846.25s]  so I'm gonna veto that one.
[5846.25s -> 5847.05s]  I can't veto all.
[5847.05s -> 5848.49s]  I have to play all of them.
[5848.49s -> 5849.60s]  I'm gonna veto.
[5850.16s -> 5857.77s]  So that is...
[5859.05s -> 5860.97s]  Actually, it's kind of a fight between the two of them.
[5864.78s -> 5867.82s]  Crystal ice quest or crystal ice quest is...
[5867.82s -> 5868.62s]  No, it's not.
[5868.62s -> 5869.50s]  What's going on here?
[5870.30s -> 5872.70s]  Oh, it's because people can just spam click it.
[5872.70s -> 5875.18s]  Sometimes it just makes that happen for some reason.
[5877.12s -> 5879.12s]  Now you can't do that.
[5879.68s -> 5881.16s]  Go ahead and do it again.
[5884.89s -> 5885.45s]  What do I do?
[5885.45s -> 5886.33s]  Just click what you want.
[5886.33s -> 5886.65s]  Yep.
[5886.65s -> 5889.13s]  Just click the screen over a game
[5889.13s -> 5893.34s]  that does not have an X on it that you would like to see.
[5893.34s -> 5897.07s]  It's not working.
[5898.16s -> 5901.04s]  You might have to activate or click on this.
[5901.04s -> 5901.84s]  It's an extension.
[5902.56s -> 5904.64s]  So you might have to refresh the page.
[5904.64s -> 5906.88s]  There's probably a button there that you can press on the screen.
[5906.88s -> 5908.80s]  Maybe that's like, oh, he's got an extension going.
[5910.64s -> 5911.36s]  You're on mobile.
[5911.36s -> 5914.73s]  Oh, oh, it probably doesn't work on mobile then.
[5915.37s -> 5917.32s]  All right.
[5917.32s -> 5919.32s]  Looks like we're gonna play a crystal ice quest.
[5926.91s -> 5931.63s]  What are you linking me here?
[5931.63s -> 5932.75s]  Yeah, what about it?
[5932.75s -> 5933.87s]  What do you want me to do about this?
[5937.92s -> 5942.16s]  See, now the real joke would be if you were to put that onto one of the witch's faces.
[5942.16s -> 5955.55s]  I mean, that would have been well, that's what I would have done.
[5956.62s -> 5958.14s]  Anyways, let's go ahead and move back over here.
[5958.78s -> 5961.88s]  So we're going to go.
[5961.88s -> 5963.64s]  It was what was it?
[5963.64s -> 5964.52s]  Ice crystal ice.
[5965.16s -> 5969.40s]  This one is in its own window.
[5969.40s -> 5969.88s]  Thank God.
[5970.52s -> 5975.96s]  So hard.
[5975.96s -> 5977.32s]  I'm not touching any of these.
[5985.31s -> 5988.67s]  Get in a better spot for you to actually see what's going on.
[5991.08s -> 5992.52s]  Sound volume too high.
[5993.56s -> 5997.18s]  All right, let's play.
[6002.33s -> 6005.37s]  Uh, why does it stop here?
[6009.23s -> 6010.43s]  You have such a huge map.
[6011.64s -> 6012.20s]  This is it.
[6015.58s -> 6016.06s]  The link.
[6016.94s -> 6020.52s]  Click the link.
[6020.52s -> 6021.16s]  Click the link.
[6028.16s -> 6028.56s]  Hold on.
[6028.56s -> 6029.12s]  That is.
[6032.48s -> 6033.44s]  All right, let's go.
[6033.44s -> 6034.08s]  Let's take a look.
[6043.28s -> 6044.24s]  Oh, my God.
[6045.63s -> 6046.35s]  That was fast.
[6047.55s -> 6050.60s]  All right, level one crab.
[6052.94s -> 6054.86s]  This is, I don't want to play this too much for my brain.
[6054.86s -> 6056.30s]  I already don't think I know how to do this.
[6056.30s -> 6058.94s]  Move a piece of ice using the left mouse button.
[6058.94s -> 6060.62s]  Use the right mouse button for rotation.
[6061.26s -> 6063.74s]  You can throw unnecessary pieces of ice into the fire.
[6064.70s -> 6066.94s]  You can light the fire by using wood.
[6066.94s -> 6069.98s]  Each amplification reduces time of flaming up by 20 percent.
[6070.94s -> 6073.82s]  When the water is filled with pieces of ice, you lose the level.
[6074.78s -> 6075.66s]  Bonus purchasing.
[6075.66s -> 6076.86s]  Left click to bonus purchase.
[6076.86s -> 6077.90s]  Make pieces.
[6077.90s -> 6079.82s]  Press to make the next piece of ice appear.
[6089.29s -> 6093.21s]  Disaster has fallen upon the inhabitants of tropical islands everywhere.
[6093.21s -> 6095.69s]  A relentless frost has crept over everything.
[6096.33s -> 6097.77s]  Palm trees are iced over.
[6097.77s -> 6099.53s]  Fish are frozen solid in the seas.
[6100.09s -> 6101.77s]  Birds cannot take flight.
[6101.77s -> 6106.17s]  The Snow King has chosen a new location for the capital of his icy domain.
[6106.73s -> 6111.13s]  Only he and some penguins are happy about the frozen wasteland the world has become.
[6111.77s -> 6114.57s]  But fire still burns on your island.
[6114.57s -> 6116.97s]  You still have a glimmer of hope in your heart.
[6117.69s -> 6120.81s]  To return life to these once-blessed places.
[6120.89s -> 6123.37s]  Reach the palace of the Snow King.
[6143.76s -> 6147.12s]  Oh no, this is gonna take extra brain power.
[6147.12s -> 6149.52s]  This piece of ice contains a bonus fish.
[6153.56s -> 6155.72s]  Okay, I got a fish.
[6156.28s -> 6179.16s]  Okay, let's go, let's go.
[6181.92s -> 6183.44s]  Uh-oh, now I got it.
[6190.04s -> 6193.56s]  Press for use of the exempted bonus animal.
[6193.56s -> 6195.56s]  What the fuck are you talking to me for?
[6196.60s -> 6197.64s]  Part of fish.
[6197.64s -> 6197.88s]  Click.
[6197.88s -> 6198.44s]  The game crashed.
[6199.08s -> 6200.56s]  No it didn't.
[6200.56s -> 6201.76s]  What? I didn't, I couldn't even read it.
[6201.76s -> 6202.32s]  What did it say?
[6203.12s -> 6207.55s]  What did it say?
[6208.11s -> 6208.51s]  I don't know.
[6208.51s -> 6209.15s]  I have no idea.
[6213.90s -> 6214.62s]  Nope.
[6214.62s -> 6227.55s]  Oh my god, that's all it does.
[6228.27s -> 6229.47s]  What a piece of shit.
[6230.43s -> 6237.79s]  Throw unnecessary pieces into the fire.
[6239.63s -> 6240.83s]  Oh, the fire's gone now though.
[6240.83s -> 6241.47s]  I think I lost.
[6242.19s -> 6242.83s]  I think I lose.
[6243.79s -> 6246.86s]  I've only done diamonds over here.
[6246.86s -> 6248.06s]  I haven't done anything else.
[6248.78s -> 6254.49s]  Shit.
[6254.49s -> 6271.90s]  Uh-oh, where are the other pieces?
[6271.90s -> 6272.22s]  Come on.
[6272.86s -> 6275.15s]  Give me one more piece.
[6275.15s -> 6276.75s]  Burn it in the fire and that's a perfect score.
[6277.55s -> 6290.28s]  Level two is turtle.
[6291.08s -> 6294.35s]  Okay, this fills the grid, adds extra points.
[6294.35s -> 6295.55s]  I can't sit here and read that.
[6296.27s -> 6301.47s]  What?
[6301.47s -> 6302.27s]  What does the snail do?
[6302.27s -> 6303.39s]  Slows down time.
[6303.39s -> 6305.07s]  Oh, now they're introducing different pieces.
[6306.19s -> 6308.20s]  No, I gotta save these.
[6308.92s -> 6309.72s]  Nope.
[6309.72s -> 6310.52s]  No.
[6310.52s -> 6310.84s]  Nope.
[6311.64s -> 6320.11s]  See what I mean?
[6320.11s -> 6321.39s]  Those have to go in here.
[6329.10s -> 6335.58s]  Fuck.
[6335.58s -> 6336.08s]  Shit.
[6336.70s -> 6339.60s]  What does this do with these?
[6347.32s -> 6349.16s]  Oh, then none of these are ever gonna fit ever again.
[6350.59s -> 6352.43s]  Press to make the next piece of ice appear.
[6352.43s -> 6354.51s]  Why would I do that when I'm already so far behind?
[6358.19s -> 6358.59s]  Oops.
[6358.59s -> 6359.39s]  I fucked that one up.
[6359.95s -> 6403.90s]  This one's fun.
[6406.35s -> 6408.19s]  I actually truly believe this one's fun.
[6408.99s -> 6410.28s]  What did I do that for?
[6410.28s -> 6412.12s]  That was such a not funny fucking thing to do.
[6412.12s -> 6414.44s]  Get it all in one go before they all fall in the fucking water.
[6415.24s -> 6416.12s]  All in one go.
[6428.57s -> 6429.05s]  Watch this.
[6429.61s -> 6431.28s]  It's my attempt.
[6432.22s -> 6432.72s]  Ready?
[6472.11s -> 6473.47s]  I don't like the individual pieces.
[6474.43s -> 6479.02s]  It hurts to try to do them one at a time like that.
[6479.02s -> 6480.14s]  Why did I do them like that?
[6480.86s -> 6490.25s]  All right.
[6490.25s -> 6490.65s]  We're good.
[6491.45s -> 6530.81s]  I'm gonna throw up.
[6531.53s -> 6532.51s]  I might.
[6532.51s -> 6534.27s]  I'm gonna slow down.
[6534.27s -> 6569.37s]  We can do that more than once.
[6569.37s -> 6570.97s]  I should have thought I didn't know what it was doing.
[6571.77s -> 6578.36s]  All right.
[6578.36s -> 6608.04s]  I'm not gonna lose.
[6608.04s -> 6608.52s]  I'm fine.
[6609.56s -> 6614.33s]  All right.
[6614.33s -> 6616.73s]  This one's fun, but I gotta move on.
[6617.69s -> 6618.41s]  That was interesting.
[6619.21s -> 6622.01s]  This game's actually cool.
[6623.53s -> 6625.05s]  One of the only interesting mechanics.
[6626.01s -> 6630.28s]  All these new pieces to bring in.
[6630.28s -> 6631.16s]  What a cool game.
[6635.29s -> 6635.93s]  I fucked it up.
[6636.49s -> 6641.16s]  That was interesting.
[6641.16s -> 6641.88s]  What was that one called?
[6642.44s -> 6648.78s]  That was called Crystal Ice Quest.
[6648.78s -> 6650.14s]  Drop that one down if you want to play it.
[6650.78s -> 6652.92s]  All right.
[6652.92s -> 6665.68s]  Let's.
[6665.68s -> 6666.48s]  All right.
[6666.48s -> 6667.20s]  I gotta pee.
[6670.14s -> 6672.78s]  Every time the stream has been up for two hours, I have to pee.
[6674.22s -> 6676.06s]  I need to get a urinal in this room.
[6676.88s -> 6679.04s]  Just mute the microphone and just go piss into the wall.
[6679.68s -> 6683.12s]  I wonder if I ever had a million dollars,
[6683.92s -> 6688.32s]  I would install a urinal in the closet behind me.
[6688.32s -> 6690.43s]  Think about that.
[6690.43s -> 6691.55s]  Think about how easy that would be.
[6692.35s -> 6694.83s]  So we're gonna play Solitaire, it looks like.
[6694.83s -> 6696.43s]  So thanks for the votes.
[6697.15s -> 6699.36s]  But honest to God, right?
[6700.24s -> 6702.72s]  Imagine if there was in that closet right there,
[6702.72s -> 6703.92s]  there was just a urinal.
[6704.48s -> 6706.48s]  And I could just slide it open and just go in there
[6706.48s -> 6709.92s]  and just the whole back wall would just be a porcelain.
[6710.56s -> 6713.12s]  And just all the way down in a giant drain in the bottom.
[6713.12s -> 6715.36s]  I just piss directly into the back of the closet.
[6717.08s -> 6717.40s]  Great.
[6718.81s -> 6719.77s]  Or just the floor.
[6721.53s -> 6724.01s]  If right here underneath me was just porcelain
[6724.73s -> 6726.01s]  and just it was a drain.
[6726.97s -> 6728.81s]  I think we've already said this before.
[6728.81s -> 6731.53s]  Yeah, we have.
[6731.53s -> 6732.49s]  We have talked about this.
[6733.13s -> 6735.63s]  Imagine you could just piss directly into your floor
[6735.63s -> 6737.15s]  and it would just go down into your plumbing.
[6743.24s -> 6746.84s]  Who wants to get up and walk down the stairs?
[6755.58s -> 6756.94s]  That's revolting, please stop.
[6757.50s -> 6759.26s]  What's revolting about going pee?
[6763.29s -> 6764.33s]  That's revolting?
[6768.20s -> 6769.56s]  Pee is revolting.
[6772.67s -> 6773.79s]  All right, Solitaire it is.
[6775.24s -> 6777.16s]  Spider Gold Solitaire.
[6777.16s -> 6779.80s]  This is going to be fun because I don't have any idea how to play this.
[6780.44s -> 6782.12s]  I don't know how to play Solitaire.
[6784.83s -> 6786.19s]  Not a single clue.
[6786.19s -> 6793.68s]  This is this image is fucking going to haunt me.
[6798.57s -> 6802.09s]  And it doesn't even matter because Solitaire does not open.
[6802.09s -> 6805.77s]  So we get to save ourselves about 15 straight minutes of me
[6805.77s -> 6809.13s]  clicking on random cards and asking if I'm doing it right.
[6811.40s -> 6814.44s]  And just for the sake of everyone thinks, well, he's a liar.
[6815.08s -> 6816.20s]  We've got a liar here.
[6817.32s -> 6818.36s]  Solitaire Gold.
[6819.24s -> 6819.56s]  Click.
[6820.20s -> 6821.84s]  You see the spinning wheel?
[6822.40s -> 6826.12s]  I don't see it anymore.
[6826.12s -> 6826.92s]  We don't got a game.
[6827.56s -> 6828.48s]  No game.
[6834.94s -> 6836.22s]  Still a liar.
[6836.22s -> 6844.25s]  We just cover that up and go again.
[6845.29s -> 6847.21s]  I will see you guys in two seconds.
[6847.21s -> 6850.73s]  I'm just going to go pee into my closet directly into the back of the porcelain wall.
[6851.96s -> 6853.80s]  And please vote for something that you'd like to see.
[6989.37s -> 6990.81s]  That's a nice traffic light.
[6994.06s -> 6995.26s]  Is this streamers choice?
[6995.26s -> 6995.74s]  It must be.
[6996.38s -> 7010.09s]  You just made that's just a train symbol thing.
[7010.09s -> 7012.56s]  The train sign.
[7012.80s -> 7013.76s]  There's a train here.
[7013.76s -> 7015.04s]  Railroad crossing.
[7015.04s -> 7017.52s]  I think that's what that is.
[7018.16s -> 7023.96s]  All right, so I'm going to play because people don't want to have
[7025.00s -> 7030.17s]  anything besides a long shape with two circles on the ends of it.
[7033.07s -> 7034.51s]  Not everything we draw is a dick.
[7034.51s -> 7035.79s]  Are you sure about that?
[7035.79s -> 7040.86s]  To me, this looks like it looks like people were drawing a very long shape.
[7041.74s -> 7044.54s]  And then other people came in to try to save this.
[7045.26s -> 7054.65s]  That's what I think happened.
[7054.65s -> 7056.41s]  What kind of a dick has six balls?
[7057.13s -> 7059.82s]  You know what?
[7059.82s -> 7061.66s]  How about we just move on from this topic?
[7062.30s -> 7064.30s]  And I'm going to play the pyramid of gold.
[7070.92s -> 7071.72s]  Now the train.
[7073.85s -> 7074.33s]  Good job.
[7074.33s -> 7076.17s]  This is this is a solitaire.
[7076.17s -> 7078.49s]  This is salt pyramid solitaire.
[7078.49s -> 7081.74s]  All right, let's see if it opens.
[7106.30s -> 7109.15s]  Oh, well, all right.
[7109.15s -> 7111.07s]  It's it's time for streamers choice.
[7112.08s -> 7117.10s]  I want to play the pinball game up there.
[7117.10s -> 7121.00s]  Ace's pinball wacky worlds streamers choice.
[7139.80s -> 7145.90s]  You know, this is really bright and painful.
[7150.52s -> 7151.08s]  This hurts.
[7151.08s -> 7154.36s]  Oh, Jeremy, we know your name.
[7172.24s -> 7176.49s]  Reset its transformation and just go like this.
[7178.08s -> 7178.96s]  That looks good.
[7182.88s -> 7189.48s]  So I'm punching you guys in the face.
[7190.12s -> 7190.68s]  I'm sorry.
[7202.04s -> 7202.52s]  All right.
[7202.52s -> 7204.44s]  So this is score is health options.
[7204.44s -> 7205.56s]  Let's just start.
[7205.56s -> 7206.20s]  It's pinball.
[7207.16s -> 7210.27s]  How is this pinball?
[7211.07s -> 7215.76s]  Oh, it's one of these.
[7215.76s -> 7218.88s]  That is one that's never that ball is never coming back down here.
[7226.94s -> 7227.74s]  Where is the ball?
[7227.74s -> 7228.54s]  Look, do you see this?
[7228.54s -> 7235.34s]  Which is too many balls.
[7236.14s -> 7242.78s]  This is too distracting.
[7242.78s -> 7243.90s]  So it's this one.
[7243.90s -> 7256.72s]  It was balls of bread.
[7257.68s -> 7269.36s]  Seriously, in a game where you have to catch the ball,
[7269.36s -> 7278.22s]  having all these other tiny balls throw off at the same time is just very distracting.
[7278.22s -> 7278.70s]  I hate it.
[7284.36s -> 7285.00s]  Multi ball.
[7285.64s -> 7287.98s]  What the fuck?
[7287.98s -> 7305.61s]  I got it.
[7305.61s -> 7307.45s]  I got them both the same time.
[7307.45s -> 7320.40s]  Thumbs up.
[7320.96s -> 7323.37s]  Hey, if you like what you see,
[7325.50s -> 7328.06s]  give the channel a fucking four out of 10.
[7328.78s -> 7333.74s]  This is kind of cool.
[7333.74s -> 7335.10s]  I'm getting a picture up back there.
[7339.77s -> 7340.81s]  This is cool.
[7340.81s -> 7342.25s]  It's not, but it is.
[7342.25s -> 7342.89s]  It's all right.
[7343.69s -> 7347.88s]  You get rid of these falling down crystal ball things
[7347.88s -> 7349.80s]  and I think you got yourself with a pretty solid,
[7350.84s -> 7352.12s]  let's break out type game.
[7352.12s -> 7359.61s]  This is where I get a shine here.
[7360.65s -> 7362.78s]  Oh, nevermind.
[7363.34s -> 7364.30s]  I got a bad one.
[7364.94s -> 7373.31s]  Those lemons wasted.
[7376.44s -> 7390.81s]  Small ball.
[7390.81s -> 7401.16s]  I've been holding on to this for days.
[7401.16s -> 7403.02s]  It's been like three days, two days.
[7403.02s -> 7404.38s]  I've been, remember what I was going to say?
[7405.34s -> 7406.62s]  Oh, thank God.
[7407.87s -> 7410.27s]  That's been trying to happen for like two straight days.
[7413.15s -> 7414.43s]  I feel so much better.
[7415.95s -> 7421.20s]  If you watched the stream yesterday,
[7421.20s -> 7423.04s]  that's tried to happen twice,
[7423.04s -> 7424.56s]  three, four times during that stream.
[7425.69s -> 7427.68s]  Man, I feel great.
[7428.48s -> 7447.39s]  That was fun.
[7447.39s -> 7448.59s]  I don't want to sit there and play it.
[7449.15s -> 7460.22s]  What was that?
[7460.22s -> 7461.90s]  That was, that was a streamer's choice.
[7462.62s -> 7465.50s]  It was a wacky pinball.
[7475.50s -> 7477.42s]  So we got another Solitaire game.
[7477.42s -> 7485.63s]  I hope it doesn't open and we'll find out.
[7485.63s -> 7493.84s]  This is Klondike Solitaire.
[7493.84s -> 7495.52s]  I don't think any of the Solitaire games are going to open.
[7497.34s -> 7506.72s]  Nope, none of them.
[7506.72s -> 7509.24s]  Might as well just get them out of the way now
[7509.24s -> 7516.62s]  because they're not going to open.
[7516.62s -> 7520.08s]  What would you do to play Klondike Solitaire?
[7520.08s -> 7521.12s]  Would you quack like a duck?
[7521.84s -> 7522.08s]  No.
[7522.81s -> 7523.53s]  Are you sure?
[7524.17s -> 7526.57s]  What about the delicious chocolate crispy filling?
[7527.21s -> 7528.09s]  I don't know about that.
[7528.65s -> 7530.00s]  Would you bark like a dog?
[7532.81s -> 7534.57s]  God, those commercials made me fucking.
[7535.29s -> 7545.24s]  Oh, go watch the Klondike Bar commercials
[7545.24s -> 7546.36s]  and just be like, damn,
[7546.92s -> 7551.80s]  I wouldn't do that for a fucking 39 cent brick of ice cream.
[7554.68s -> 7555.96s]  All right, cover that one up.
[7566.81s -> 7569.77s]  What would you do for a Klondike Bar?
[7577.53s -> 7578.01s]  Where is it?
[7590.01s -> 7591.77s]  I know the last three might cover this up.
[7591.77s -> 7593.53s]  I know it's a joke.
[7595.02s -> 7595.58s]  Where are we going?
[7602.43s -> 7603.55s]  Solitaire.
[7603.55s -> 7605.63s]  All right, Solitaire doesn't gold.
[7605.63s -> 7606.27s]  I'm clicking it.
[7607.72s -> 7608.92s]  It's not opening.
[7608.92s -> 7610.68s]  None of the Solitaire games work.
[7610.68s -> 7612.36s]  We might as well just skip them all.
[7613.56s -> 7614.52s]  Nope, it doesn't open.
[7614.52s -> 7615.96s]  I just clicked it out of.
[7616.60s -> 7618.56s]  No, try again.
[7621.00s -> 7622.04s]  Liar, liar.
[7625.18s -> 7626.54s]  Solitaire doesn't gold.
[7630.44s -> 7630.92s]  Nothing.
[7631.48s -> 7643.29s]  None of them are going to open.
[7643.29s -> 7644.33s]  It's because I've run.
[7644.33s -> 7646.41s]  I've, I've, don't listen.
[7646.41s -> 7648.09s]  I've run as administrator.
[7648.09s -> 7649.77s]  The whole thing is running as administrator.
[7649.77s -> 7651.13s]  And when I go in and do administrator
[7651.13s -> 7653.37s]  and compatibility, it does the same thing.
[7653.37s -> 7655.21s]  And force it to 640 by 480
[7655.21s -> 7657.29s]  and take away the DPI settings
[7657.29s -> 7662.84s]  and reduce arrow and all of it.
[7662.84s -> 7674.01s]  What is that one?
[7674.01s -> 7674.97s]  Fairy Tail Quest.
[7682.64s -> 7683.92s]  Fairy Tail Quest.
[7683.92s -> 7686.92s]  Let's see how bad this one smells.
[7688.83s -> 7689.95s]  Thank you for voting.
[7689.95s -> 7697.13s]  Let's give it a go.
[7697.13s -> 7697.93s]  Fairy Tail Quest.
[7701.44s -> 7702.08s]  It opens.
[7702.72s -> 7705.44s]  Hooray.
[7705.44s -> 7707.28s]  But, okay, it is.
[7707.28s -> 7711.28s]  It's going to be a match three game, isn't it?
[7728.96s -> 7729.44s]  I maybe.
[7731.60s -> 7732.32s]  No, okay.
[7732.32s -> 7733.04s]  Okay, hold on.
[7733.04s -> 7734.16s]  No, I know what's going on here.
[7734.80s -> 7735.28s]  No, I don't.
[7750.28s -> 7750.76s]  Adventure.
[7751.96s -> 7754.24s]  Wait, let me fix this.
[7762.43s -> 7762.91s]  Start here.
[7763.87s -> 7765.07s]  I get to read something in that.
[7765.95s -> 7769.15s]  Medieval fantasy voice that I do all the time.
[7770.03s -> 7778.86s]  Rotate chips to combine three or more bottles.
[7779.50s -> 7780.14s]  Yeah.
[7780.14s -> 7785.08s]  The game board clockwise.
[7785.08s -> 7787.24s]  Click them to the right of the board.
[7787.24s -> 7787.88s]  Oh, no.
[7788.92s -> 7789.72s]  I don't like this.
[7791.00s -> 7801.53s]  Yo, you have to open the...
[7802.73s -> 7803.93s]  Yo, you got to open the chests.
[7804.73s -> 7805.13s]  Okay.
[7806.73s -> 7808.89s]  To beat the level, you must open all trunks.
[7808.89s -> 7809.39s]  Okay.
[7810.25s -> 7867.12s]  Bottles in a line against...
[7867.12s -> 7868.48s]  Oh, my God.
[7868.48s -> 7873.05s]  Do your own sound effects.
[7873.05s -> 7873.53s]  Again.
[7873.53s -> 7874.17s]  You want me to do that?
[7874.17s -> 7874.67s]  Again.
[7875.21s -> 7879.72s]  I need the music at least.
[7884.33s -> 7893.90s]  Okay.
[7894.92s -> 7902.90s]  Go.
[7903.28s -> 7906.36s]  I've delayed sound.
[7906.36s -> 7907.48s]  What the fuck was that?
[7907.48s -> 7908.36s]  The game like fucked up?
[7921.18s -> 7927.85s]  That one goes too fast.
[7927.85s -> 7928.41s]  I can't do that.
[7934.80s -> 7935.36s]  What was this one?
[7937.28s -> 7938.56s]  Adventure or something.
[7938.56s -> 7939.52s]  Fairy tale adventure.
[7941.45s -> 7949.63s]  There it is.
[7949.63s -> 7951.26s]  Go on.
[7951.26s -> 7951.76s]  Go on.
[7957.88s -> 7959.24s]  You guys just going through all the ones
[7960.35s -> 7962.35s]  that have quest in the title.
[7962.35s -> 7963.63s]  No, that's the same one.
[7964.43s -> 7965.55s]  That's the same one.
[7965.55s -> 7971.20s]  They just put it there twice.
[7971.20s -> 7972.48s]  Why is it here twice?
[7974.38s -> 7980.32s]  I hope it doesn't open.
[7980.32s -> 7981.04s]  No, it's the same thing.
[7981.04s -> 7981.60s]  It opened again.
[7981.60s -> 7982.08s]  It's fine.
[7982.24s -> 7982.72s]  Here it is.
[7986.40s -> 7987.76s]  It's not a different game.
[7987.76s -> 7994.00s]  But here's the crazy part.
[7994.56s -> 7995.68s]  If it is a separate game
[7995.68s -> 7996.64s]  with a separate folder,
[7996.64s -> 7998.40s]  why would it still have Jay here?
[7999.04s -> 8007.96s]  I just opened it up again
[8007.96s -> 8008.92s]  from where I just was.
[8009.80s -> 8017.52s]  It reads your system name.
[8017.52s -> 8018.96s]  My system name is not Jay.
[8019.68s -> 8020.48s]  It's Jeremy.
[8040.12s -> 8041.40s]  My system name is not Jeremy.
[8041.40s -> 8043.96s]  My system name is marriage
[8043.96s -> 8045.24s]  because it's Jeremy backwards
[8045.24s -> 8046.44s]  and nobody would know that it was me.
[8047.16s -> 8062.56s]  You have to move the key.
[8063.92s -> 8064.42s]  I...
[8068.08s -> 8069.36s]  Why would I even begin?
[8070.08s -> 8071.63s]  It was the same thing we just did.
[8072.19s -> 8079.52s]  Restart.
[8079.52s -> 8079.92s]  Let's go.
[8080.56s -> 8095.21s]  Are you making fun of my username?
[8096.88s -> 8097.52s]  Your marriage.
[8097.52s -> 8098.80s]  Or should I say Jeremy?
[8107.24s -> 8108.60s]  Fast food.
[8108.60s -> 8112.76s]  I wonder what this one's going to be about.
[8112.76s -> 8114.36s]  Fast food mania.
[8114.36s -> 8115.64s]  It's got french fries on it.
[8115.64s -> 8116.68s]  This one looks kind of fun.
[8119.61s -> 8120.49s]  It is one of those games
[8120.49s -> 8122.01s]  that's stuffed in the corner
[8122.01s -> 8123.29s]  at 640 by 480 though.
[8123.93s -> 8133.10s]  This one could be pretty good.
[8133.10s -> 8135.66s]  Yep, there is a window log.
[8135.66s -> 8136.30s]  So that's good.
[8137.34s -> 8137.98s]  Right off the bat.
[8139.18s -> 8144.00s]  What the fuck are you doing?
[8144.40s -> 8150.78s]  I can't see where it is.
[8151.74s -> 8152.94s]  You're going to minimize when I do this?
[8156.19s -> 8156.99s]  Get back here.
[8158.27s -> 8169.12s]  Oh god.
[8169.12s -> 8169.92s]  It's scared.
[8171.85s -> 8172.97s]  It's just running away.
[8174.25s -> 8175.52s]  All right, hold on.
[8175.52s -> 8176.16s]  Almost there.
[8177.45s -> 8178.41s]  That's as good as it's going to get.
[8178.41s -> 8178.81s]  I'm sorry.
[8178.81s -> 8179.77s]  I'm not doing that anymore.
[8181.80s -> 8182.12s]  All right.
[8182.84s -> 8188.36s]  Looks good.
[8189.31s -> 8189.87s]  Play game.
[8190.59s -> 8192.41s]  Do you want to continue your last game
[8192.41s -> 8193.53s]  that you've never started?
[8196.43s -> 8197.39s]  One, six.
[8197.39s -> 8198.51s]  I can start on six.
[8198.51s -> 8199.71s]  One, six or eleven.
[8202.48s -> 8203.36s]  Why would you be able to do this?
[8203.36s -> 8203.84s]  Start.
[8203.84s -> 8204.48s]  Start on one.
[8208.65s -> 8209.29s]  Greenville.
[8210.33s -> 8210.81s]  Day one.
[8211.61s -> 8213.45s]  Today is my last day of high school.
[8213.45s -> 8215.21s]  Finally, my life can begin.
[8215.21s -> 8217.13s]  College, new friends, a great job.
[8217.13s -> 8218.09s]  Life's going to be good.
[8219.21s -> 8219.77s]  Day two.
[8220.49s -> 8221.45s]  Unbelievable.
[8221.45s -> 8223.13s]  My parents spent my college fund
[8223.13s -> 8224.09s]  on their new business.
[8225.77s -> 8228.17s]  The girl of my dreams, Nancy,
[8228.17s -> 8229.37s]  had agreed to go with me
[8229.37s -> 8230.57s]  to our graduation party
[8230.57s -> 8232.25s]  but now she's with Daryl.
[8232.97s -> 8235.05s]  A zeal upstart.
[8235.05s -> 8236.01s]  Life is over.
[8236.01s -> 8237.93s]  Goodbye, dreams.
[8240.99s -> 8242.67s]  In one day, this happens.
[8244.22s -> 8245.66s]  What a fucking journal.
[8247.79s -> 8249.55s]  Not even 24 hours go by.
[8258.64s -> 8258.96s]  All right.
[8258.96s -> 8260.48s]  You can't even have that be day
[8260.48s -> 8264.08s]  like seven or eight or like day four.
[8264.08s -> 8265.52s]  You can't have like this progress.
[8267.79s -> 8268.59s]  Oh my god.
[8270.28s -> 8271.08s]  Okay, it is.
[8271.08s -> 8271.72s]  Day three.
[8272.44s -> 8274.36s]  I need money but what can I do to earn it?
[8275.52s -> 8278.16s]  Next day, I'll work for a delivery service.
[8278.16s -> 8279.36s]  The most important thing is for me
[8279.36s -> 8281.04s]  to work fast and stay alert.
[8281.04s -> 8282.16s]  Plus if I do a good job,
[8282.16s -> 8283.36s]  the boss will pay me extra.
[8288.75s -> 8292.49s]  No, it's not a match three game.
[8292.49s -> 8293.53s]  Click on the product.
[8294.17s -> 8295.90s]  Click on the order.
[8301.47s -> 8302.67s]  This is horrendous.
[8303.47s -> 8308.54s]  This is barely a video game.
[8314.51s -> 8316.03s]  I need to see how the story plays out though.
[8316.03s -> 8316.83s]  Don't you guys want to know?
[8317.47s -> 8329.10s]  I mean, when does it end?
[8329.90s -> 8334.04s]  I need to...
[8334.04s -> 8334.76s]  Hold on a minute.
[8334.76s -> 8335.56s]  First of all, this...
[8335.56s -> 8337.72s]  I got a really important question for you guys.
[8339.84s -> 8340.48s]  This guy make...
[8340.48s -> 8344.00s]  This guy make $2,400 in one day?
[8345.42s -> 8346.78s]  Why the aliens invaded?
[8353.18s -> 8355.18s]  What does that have to do with anything?
[8355.18s -> 8356.54s]  I just made $4,100.
[8357.42s -> 8367.32s]  Okay.
[8368.27s -> 8370.43s]  On day five, I buckled down and worked hard.
[8370.43s -> 8374.17s]  Today I learned that if I deliver several orders
[8374.17s -> 8376.17s]  of the same kind in a row, I'll be paid extra.
[8376.97s -> 8378.97s]  Deliver several orders the same kind in a row
[8378.97s -> 8379.93s]  to earn extra money.
[8380.89s -> 8389.98s]  I did that, right?
[8389.98s -> 8394.86s]  You can queue them up.
[8399.00s -> 8399.80s]  Shit.
[8399.80s -> 8402.72s]  That pop-up was like a fucking troll pop-up.
[8411.15s -> 8412.67s]  Do aliens invade every day?
[8413.31s -> 8416.35s]  That's a real question.
[8417.07s -> 8418.32s]  That we should be having.
[8421.48s -> 8424.20s]  That person gave me a $2,200 tip.
[8426.52s -> 8427.72s]  Holy shit.
[8427.72s -> 8438.57s]  It's 10 grand in one day.
[8441.26s -> 8442.30s]  Delivering donuts.
[8445.63s -> 8448.67s]  And for my night job, I'm part of the Earth Defense Force.
[8449.31s -> 8451.66s]  We're not getting more lore?
[8459.50s -> 8460.22s]  600 bucks.
[8461.02s -> 8465.44s]  Just wait till it's french fries.
[8465.44s -> 8465.92s]  Who cares?
[8467.60s -> 8468.40s]  Oh, you have...
[8476.28s -> 8476.92s]  French fries?
[8479.80s -> 8480.36s]  Nah.
[8480.36s -> 8485.40s]  That's a donut double.
[8492.57s -> 8493.61s]  No, no, yeah.
[8494.49s -> 8495.80s]  I'll look at the donuts.
[8496.60s -> 8506.99s]  Don't get the UFO thing, but I'll get it 100% every time.
[8507.79s -> 8515.21s]  This is more fun than the actual video game.
[8515.93s -> 8523.95s]  So I made 20 grand in four days.
[8524.59s -> 8525.15s]  Here we go.
[8525.15s -> 8525.79s]  Day six.
[8525.79s -> 8527.55s]  Our mechanic says he could upgrade my truck
[8527.55s -> 8529.47s]  so it could go faster for short periods of time,
[8529.47s -> 8530.91s]  but he needs money for the improvements.
[8531.63s -> 8531.95s]  Okay.
[8532.83s -> 8533.31s]  Speed up.
[8534.88s -> 8535.84s]  That's four grand.
[8536.56s -> 8544.17s]  I know how to make my truck faster.
[8544.17s -> 8545.85s]  Click on the bonus icon to activate it.
[8550.73s -> 8551.45s]  No, geez.
[8558.59s -> 8558.99s]  Come on.
[8560.72s -> 8561.04s]  Got it.
[8561.85s -> 8562.33s]  Come on.
[8562.89s -> 8563.21s]  What?
[8563.77s -> 8572.28s]  I hate this.
[8572.28s -> 8578.16s]  You guys could still click on the screen that whole time.
[8578.88s -> 8586.11s]  I mean, that was just getting to be kind of mind-numbingly painful.
[8588.62s -> 8589.42s]  But what happened?
[8589.42s -> 8593.98s]  What happened is I played the game for another three or four levels in a row
[8593.98s -> 8595.98s]  and made like a hundred thousand dollars.
[8600.52s -> 8603.02s]  And then did everything that I wanted to do.
[8603.58s -> 8613.64s]  What is that one?
[8617.36s -> 8618.56s]  Montezuma's Quest.
[8624.62s -> 8626.70s]  We can't click on the last row.
[8627.34s -> 8628.22s]  Yeah, I know.
[8628.22s -> 8629.82s]  You can't click on the top row either.
[8629.82s -> 8631.10s]  I wonder why.
[8631.10s -> 8636.64s]  Is it really a surprise that the top and bottom row is pretty open?
[8637.28s -> 8644.78s]  We're going to have to just do them in a row.
[8646.30s -> 8646.62s]  All right.
[8646.62s -> 8647.50s]  Montezuma's Quest.
[8648.06s -> 8650.17s]  Let's take a look.
[8650.17s -> 8655.92s]  What up?
[8655.92s -> 8656.24s]  What up?
[8656.24s -> 8656.88s]  What up, Jerma?
[8656.88s -> 8657.12s]  Hey.
[8657.68s -> 8658.24s]  What up?
[8658.24s -> 8661.40s]  It's just, is it going to be Zuma?
[8661.40s -> 8663.28s]  It probably will be.
[8663.28s -> 8675.80s]  Okay, the slide screen is selected.
[8697.36s -> 8698.72s]  Alt F4.
[8698.72s -> 8700.72s]  What kind of game encourages Alt F4?
[8702.00s -> 8704.48s]  All right, instructions.
[8704.48s -> 8704.80s]  Yes.
[8705.36s -> 8706.16s]  Oh, God.
[8720.99s -> 8721.71s]  I don't want to read this.
[8723.07s -> 8726.22s]  They have their one piece of lore and then the game starts
[8726.22s -> 8727.58s]  and then it's just a match three game.
[8728.54s -> 8729.82s]  Oh, I missed it.
[8729.82s -> 8730.78s]  Just pretend like I read it.
[8730.78s -> 8731.34s]  Oh, go back.
[8731.34s -> 8731.90s]  Can I go back?
[8733.66s -> 8747.79s]  Archaeological Museum, Cancun, Mexico, 1935.
[8748.75s -> 8752.11s]  Graduate student Emily Jones didn't know what she was getting into when she accepted
[8752.11s -> 8756.75s]  to some position at the catalog exhibits at the Archaeological Museum in Cancun.
[8757.47s -> 8760.75s]  We heard the job provided an opportunity to study some of the most amazing artifacts
[8760.75s -> 8764.51s]  of the ancient cultures that had resided in the land known now as Mexico.
[8765.39s -> 8769.47s]  While elbow deep and dull paperwork, she was drawn to a mysterious stone,
[8769.47s -> 8771.87s]  her edifice, in the center of the museum's library.
[8771.87s -> 8776.75s]  Ancient notes penned by a Spanish monk who had served as a missionary to the Aztec
[8776.75s -> 8779.23s]  tribes mentioned a similar structure.
[8779.87s -> 8782.83s]  He claimed it was a map pointing out to a secret Aztec city.
[8784.11s -> 8788.11s]  Numerous legends said that the city was resting place of Martezuma's calendar,
[8788.11s -> 8791.63s]  a supernatural relic that granted its possessor a long life.
[8792.51s -> 8796.43s]  The monk's notes said that sun stones that could be acquired in a game of magic threes
[8797.15s -> 8802.11s]  would show up on your iPad on a week to week basis, at least 10 of them a week.
[8802.75s -> 8805.47s]  But the stone construction bore no instructions for playing the game.
[8806.03s -> 8809.31s]  Undaunted, Miss Jones searched for the museum for clues to eventually
[8809.31s -> 8813.47s]  found a dusty box of colored tokens in a forgotten corner of the repository.
[8814.27s -> 8816.67s]  Noting that some of the tokens were adorned with gems,
[8816.67s -> 8821.15s]  the young woman began stealing them and got real rich real real fucking quick.
[8821.87s -> 8825.21s]  As each one of those gems is worth about 250,000 pounds.
[8826.49s -> 8828.89s]  When she found the correct order, the tokens disappeared though.
[8829.53s -> 8832.65s]  Leaving the gems behind, even more incredible new tokens appeared in their place.
[8879.58s -> 8885.34s]  I can't sit there, you know, if it's the same thing we did before, I don't think it's like
[8885.34s -> 8899.72s]  a waste of time at that point. That's a waste of time to sit there and play.
[8899.72s -> 8902.68s]  I found the good one, which was the bubblegum crystal ball one.
[8905.40s -> 8907.88s]  Now we're going to the hidden object collection.
[8909.90s -> 8914.38s]  I'm going to laugh my ass off if this is just all of them that are in the game
[8915.18s -> 8918.20s]  that are on the disk in one spot. Let's find out.
[8927.08s -> 8952.75s]  Pirates, Egypt, Zoo, Haunted. Let's see if we can find the witch.
[8953.87s -> 8962.76s]  That's all that matters. Where's the witch? That doesn't count.
[8980.80s -> 8981.92s]  There she is. Where?
[8989.84s -> 8995.12s]  That's great. The people that are actually playing the game. That's not the witch.
[9002.86s -> 9004.54s]  How is that face not a witch?
[9007.48s -> 9017.96s]  Might be. That's not the witch either. Can somebody find the vase, please?
[9021.40s -> 9053.37s]  There's a more button. Anybody see a mug? Or a mug and a roll?
[9058.17s -> 9066.19s]  Yeah, this mug doesn't work. That's a squash. That's a hamburger.
[9068.19s -> 9076.08s]  That's a noose. That has a foot.
[9098.92s -> 9102.43s]  It's just this one spot. That's unbelievable. Okay.
[9103.55s -> 9105.39s]  Well, what else? Okay, what do you want to do now?
[9105.39s -> 9107.55s]  We're only doing one more of these. I'm not opening all of them.
[9110.27s -> 9123.68s]  Pirates? Click the X. No, we're doing pirates.
[9136.09s -> 9136.65s]  Can you get it?
[9136.65s -> 9142.33s]  It's the same song too. Oh, it's...
[9155.85s -> 9160.09s]  These are all wrong. What are you clicking on here?
[9161.05s -> 9163.53s]  Why is everybody... a bunch... what's with the parrot?
[9163.53s -> 9180.41s]  Fish? You got a spider on your screen. All right, that was fun.
[9190.38s -> 9194.14s]  No, no, we didn't finish it. No, no, no.
[9219.07s -> 9224.19s]  Imagine this is what the zoo looks like. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on,
[9224.19s -> 9226.83s]  before anybody does anything. Look at how fucked up this is.
[9228.59s -> 9233.96s]  This is the zoo when all the cages get let open. You're not going here.
[9235.00s -> 9237.56s]  Imagine how fucking dangerous and horrible this is.
[9238.44s -> 9247.88s]  It's like centipedes. The entrance to the zoo is right there.
[9249.24s -> 9261.39s]  They're all already escaped. They have a fence. Oh yeah? Mr. Alligator and Mr. Elephant
[9261.39s -> 9266.27s]  have a lot to say to you about that. And the elephant, by the way, is carrying
[9266.99s -> 9271.07s]  a giraffe inside of this basket and a cat and a megaphone.
[9273.18s -> 9282.49s]  And there's a tuba. Where is the tuba? This is the people that they've eaten.
[9283.21s -> 9292.03s]  You know, like a band came in here. Some lawyer, a witch was here, a farmer.
[9292.03s -> 9294.43s]  These are all people that have been eaten or killed here.
[9304.16s -> 9308.04s]  They even brought the witch in. The witch couldn't do shit.
[9308.04s -> 9338.94s]  There's nothing up here.
[9354.32s -> 9384.49s]  He's been so long. Get a hint. What did the hint do? Hint. Brush. Help. Monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey. What?
[9415.37s -> 9421.55s]  There's nothing here. There's a piece of wire or there's a hose over here.
[9421.55s -> 9446.35s]  Right. Okay. I get it. I understand. That was hidden objects for fun.
[9447.07s -> 9464.43s]  No, we don't have to finish it. Finishing it is not necessary. Did you have fun? Yeah?
[9465.07s -> 9474.96s]  Those of you that are curious, after we pick this. So it looks like, I'm not sure.
[9476.36s -> 9491.79s]  Is that Builder Bob or is that Adventure Tales? Probably Bob. Okay. It's Bob.
[9494.59s -> 9497.79s]  So those of you that are curious. Yes, we have this and all the X's around it.
[9498.35s -> 9517.18s]  Uh, there's also these. There is this one. Builder Bob incoming. If it opens.
[9517.82s -> 9528.52s]  That is Builder Bob. Builder Bob. Builder Bob. Where is it? It should be the right one.
[9530.49s -> 9537.21s]  There it is. It's Bulldozer Bob, not Builder Bob. No, that's what.
[9537.21s -> 9548.70s]  All right, come on. Open. Nice. Oh my god, this looks terrible.
[9551.82s -> 9567.68s]  I feel like my video card in my computer is just in physical pain right now.
[9568.32s -> 9576.88s]  The amount of resolution changes that my computer's had to go through.
[9583.55s -> 9594.14s]  Version 3.5. The best version, from my understanding. All right, Bulldozer Bob.
[9594.78s -> 9601.69s]  Your terrible crackling audio needs to be reduced. It's all right. Game speed, that's fine.
[9602.57s -> 9611.95s]  Start. Classic, advanced, or metal pack? This is going to be a Pac-Man clone.
[9621.58s -> 9624.38s]  So don't collect the bags of money. The bags of money kill you.
[9629.05s -> 9636.67s]  In what game does that happen? The bags of money are too heavy.
[9637.87s -> 9641.39s]  So I have to collect the bags after I crush them on the ground.
[9642.91s -> 9658.75s]  All right, let's kill this. Did he just take the money? He just took the money.
[9659.63s -> 9675.10s]  I feel like it's steal the money. That's kind of bullshit. Right here. Up, up, up, up. No,
[9675.10s -> 9680.46s]  don't come over this way. He's coming to get me. His AI might just be going in a random
[9680.46s -> 9688.99s]  direction though. I may be spitballing here, but I'm pretty sure that's not what a Bulldozer
[9688.99s -> 9698.06s]  does. Eat dirt? Oh god, fucking damn it. That's it. I'm not doing that one anymore.
[9708.81s -> 9717.47s]  Why does the Bulldozer have hair? I don't know. Why does Tom with the tank engine have a face?
[9721.60s -> 9737.63s]  There is no explaining it. All right, what's that one? Flybot? No, that's not the one we're
[9737.63s -> 9745.95s]  doing. Something Champ? Something Champ. It's hard to read. Billiards Champ 3D. It's got
[9745.95s -> 9752.12s]  3D in the title. So you can imagine it probably won't open. Let's give it a shot.
[9752.12s -> 9779.61s]  Is it going to open? Nope. I think more. I'm going to sneeze again.
[9782.04s -> 9788.12s]  Wait, why would I turn that on? I should turn that off, not on. What was the point of that?
[9788.68s -> 9800.16s]  Why would I? Why don't I want you guys to see me sneeze? There's no reason for that.
[9801.44s -> 9822.80s]  I'm getting excited so you guys can watch me sneeze. Now we're going to Flybot.
[9822.80s -> 9832.76s]  That's a huge amount of clicks. Flybot. You can tell this one's going to be good.
[9833.40s -> 9842.49s]  I'll show you why. Because Flybot, I don't have any idea what the guy next to Flybot is.
[9843.60s -> 9856.35s]  Take a look. Flybot is on the cover. I'm not sure what's going on here. Or what this is.
[9857.68s -> 9880.80s]  We've seen monster doors. But that's Flybot. He's the mascot. Thank god I was supposed to
[9881.12s -> 9881.60s]  get so angry.
[9893.15s -> 9904.70s]  Down. Turn it down. It's still too loud. I have to do this one at a time.
[9905.66s -> 9935.32s]  Now. I have to. Okay, so it's got to go down to the right. So we got down to the right.
[9936.04s -> 9939.40s]  I'm going to say like right there. Let me know if it's right.
[9949.18s -> 9960.00s]  It's a little off. It needs to be up. Go up like half an inch. Like that. It should be okay.
[9960.56s -> 9970.03s]  Just as good as it's going to get. Start game.
[9970.75s -> 9977.53s]  Frozen hands planet. Be careful. This is a very cold and snowy place.
[9978.09s -> 9984.01s]  The hands that inhabit this planet are frozen. Hence they are not dangerous. The
[9984.01s -> 9988.73s]  aliens on this planet are studying flies behavior in cold conditions. Your objective
[9988.73s -> 9996.92s]  is to save the flies from becoming icicles with rocket launchers, grenades, and guns.
[9997.48s -> 10011.04s]  Right. This is a first platformer of the whole package. Free all the flies.
[10011.52s -> 10027.58s]  Free flies. It's just raining hell at all times. Alright, let's go jump. Hints. Z, X, C, V. Choose
[10027.58s -> 10038.28s]  weapon. Alright. I only got one. V. I need to sit down on it. Okay. X is. Do you kill things
[10038.28s -> 10053.66s]  or is it just knock them out? I think he's dead. Did I free the fly? I want to save
[10060.94s -> 10070.78s]  that shit. Oops. What is the music that's playing?
[10074.84s -> 10085.26s]  I have plenty of energy. 99 energy. What does that guy up there for?
[10099.72s -> 10109.71s]  Box right on top is the worst. Alright, that's three flies. I got it. That's it, right?
[10109.71s -> 10141.28s]  Wait for transport platform. Alright. Impatient, but it's fine. I win. We just go again. Don't stop.
[10143.84s -> 10147.92s]  Oh, okay. Shoot at the switcher.
[10166.57s -> 10175.55s]  Alright, I'm gonna get there and then I'm gonna turn this game on.
[10177.95s -> 10191.71s]  Speedrunner, let's go. Look. Oh yeah, I died. Mission failed. The Earth is left
[10191.71s -> 10200.09s]  without flies. Click here again. That's good. That's a good thing. Flies are fucking horrible.
[10200.09s -> 10215.53s]  I'm glad. That's great that they're gone. Year 2009. April 38th. Monday. Yeah, the 38th day
[10215.53s -> 10222.25s]  of April in 2009. That was real fucked up. Remember that? No fly with any insect
[10222.25s -> 10226.73s]  dignity will ever forget this day. Yeah, that was the day when hordes of alien scum
[10226.73s -> 10233.45s]  attacked our little green planet. These monstrous green freaks had harassed three grasshoppers,
[10234.25s -> 10240.89s]  stolen spots from the ladybug's wings, but most importantly kidnapped all flies from planet
[10240.89s -> 10247.21s]  Earth. Some say they took a bug with them, but that information was later reputed by two
[10247.21s -> 10256.12s]  stampeds that insist it was a bear, not a bug. We can only guess. This is a writing assignment
[10256.12s -> 10263.69s]  for a third grader. This is a writing assignment. Talk about, give a story of how the aliens came
[10263.69s -> 10270.12s]  and took the bugs. The British intelligence sources have proof that the reason all flies
[10270.12s -> 10274.92s]  were awarded to the alien spacecraft is because of their brains, or lack thereof to be exact.
[10275.48s -> 10279.32s]  The aliens wanted to know how flies managed to think without having this important neural
[10279.32s -> 10284.12s]  organ. So far the aliens have performed one surgical brain removal to one of their own.
[10284.76s -> 10289.80s]  The experiment was deemed to be a failure. Right now all flies from planet Earth are packed inside
[10289.80s -> 10295.00s]  one gallon glass jugs and are hidden on five different plants. But the flies called John
[10295.00s -> 10300.36s]  and Hans got lucky. They managed to befriend the alien who had his brain removed. He turned
[10300.36s -> 10305.80s]  out to be a real groovy dude and let the flies out. In the room next door, John and Hans
[10305.80s -> 10309.88s]  have stumbled upon the latest model of the alien combat robot. Hans turned out to be a
[10309.88s -> 10316.36s]  great mechanic. He got inside and started the robot. John used to live near the pilot's
[10316.36s -> 10320.44s]  cafeteria before he managed to learn robots navigation system. They called their robot
[10320.44s -> 10325.16s]  Flybot. Now with such powerful weapon at their arsenal, they've rushed to save their
[10325.16s -> 10344.11s]  fellow insects. May the force be with them. May the force be with you. That was, I was,
[10344.11s -> 10360.41s]  I was a joy to read that. That was better than the game. Hold on. Don't click yet. Don't
[10360.41s -> 10380.97s]  click yet. I was looking for this game for ages. Well it's Flybot. Where are you guys going? I
[10380.97s -> 10384.65s]  can't tell if this is another checkers joke or if this is the one above checkers and it's a
[10384.65s -> 10398.09s]  hundred percent. Why? You guys that hell bent on the one that's above there. What is it?
[10401.32s -> 10417.16s]  This is Mystic Store. Mystic Store. I'm gonna have to change this if it opens.
[10417.16s -> 10425.10s]  Let's hope it does. Oh wait a minute. I spoke too soon. It's opening
[10428.38s -> 10466.57s]  and it's already in a perfect spot. Player one. These are shotgun sounds. Yeah they are.
[10467.87s -> 10474.75s]  They really are. I wonder what Mystic Store is going to be about. I'm actually excited.
[10476.80s -> 10484.46s]  All right let's go. To make an artifact for the guests, pick up magic elements.
[10485.18s -> 10489.10s]  You can cheer up a guest with the help of potions that finish the level.
[10489.10s -> 10491.18s]  Pick up magic elements and use them. Okay.
[10493.42s -> 10498.14s]  Once upon a time the wise elf L'Oreal built a store where he created magic artifacts with
[10498.14s -> 10502.86s]  the help of ancient spells. Soon after he left his shop and moved to distant lands.
[10503.66s -> 10509.90s]  Many sages and magicians have tried in vain to master L'Oreal's art. Since those times
[10509.90s -> 10514.22s]  the shop is empty and does not please the visitors with magic goods. But it is likely
[10514.22s -> 10519.66s]  you'll be able to master the magic of L'Oreal and become the owner of the Mystic Snort.
[10523.52s -> 10529.12s]  Day one of 25. Click a group of three or more similar elements to collect them. Look at that.
[10534.06s -> 10547.82s]  Make an artifact. Over time a guest becomes impatient. Oh I need to give you what? What do
[10547.82s -> 10570.38s]  you want? Wand of water. Sound effects are pretty good. He didn't get what he wanted?
[10571.02s -> 10590.40s]  Wand of water. Number two where's the second guest? I don't know this one's just kind of dull.
[10591.04s -> 10595.53s]  Sounds are all right but the game itself is just click on groups of three or more.
[10596.09s -> 10614.33s]  It's not that thinkable. Just the giant color on the screen. The door knocking made me go outside.
[10615.77s -> 10638.27s]  PSVR. Hey enjoy that man. Spend rubies. Buy the secrets of the artifacts of the rubies you've
[10638.27s -> 10661.21s]  collected. Who cares? I need 60 rubies. What's wand of fire? I got it. Wand of gnomes.
[10665.02s -> 10669.42s]  If I had the wherewithal I would take a one second clip of the
[10671.10s -> 10675.10s]  and cue it up so when I clicked right here it would do it. But I'm not going to do that.
[10675.10s -> 10690.88s]  I'm just going to click the X and save everybody's pain. I'm surprised that one actually
[10690.88s -> 10704.80s]  opened. Click away. Where are the clicks? What happened? What's going on with this pole?
[10704.80s -> 10729.64s]  Is it broken? Where is it? I thought it was not there. What the hell? I think it's screwed up.
[10732.43s -> 10736.27s]  No it's there. Maybe it took a second. Maybe I did it too many times that I broke it.
[10740.01s -> 10754.57s]  We already picked all the good games except for cubic frenzy. We were thinking about
[10754.57s -> 10771.02s]  our choices. All right cubic frenzy. Boy this is going to be interesting. Do I have
[10771.02s -> 10777.02s]  logic slider cubie groups? Click three. I need to change. Hold on. There is no options menu or
[10777.02s -> 10790.62s]  anything. Uh a second. I gotta drag it down to the right. Let's see how good that is.
[10791.42s -> 10802.96s]  How does that look? Eh close. Almost. Close enough. No it's not. I can do better. It's
[10802.96s -> 10818.24s]  just a little bit more. All right that's fine. All right what does click three mean? Click
[10818.24s -> 10823.84s]  three cubie groups or logic slider. Click three. Flood puzzle arcade flood.
[10824.80s -> 10834.70s]  Normal. It's the same thing I just did. All right I'm going for a full page of blue.
[10837.74s -> 10872.48s]  Only blue. I want a full stack of blue. Oh kids mode. It just turns into strawberries.
[10873.20s -> 10896.59s]  And now we gotta get all pandas. What happened? Have you used the combos?
[10897.47s -> 10945.42s]  Am I supposed to be moving them? No it's happening. It was coming.
[10948.38s -> 10956.41s]  Play the monster game. I already did the monster game and I didn't like it. Actually yeah I did.
[10956.41s -> 10967.96s]  Did I? I don't even remember liking it. Where was that one? Oh monster village is what you're
[10967.96s -> 10974.25s]  talking about. Monster village. Not monster doors. It's the village where the doors are.
[10974.81s -> 10986.27s]  You get to actually go in their houses now. Where the hell was this? I don't even remember
[10986.43s -> 11004.27s]  what. Oh it's cubic frenzy. Okay monster village. Let's check it out. Island maze escape has a rat.
[11006.96s -> 11015.40s]  Well we'll have to check that out another time. Monster village does open.
[11031.16s -> 11048.60s]  Private player. Play game. In a small town by a bridge lived a group of
[11049.16s -> 11055.80s]  hobsters. A whimsical race of inventors. They created an earthly paradise called monster town.
[11056.36s -> 11061.24s]  Word of the settlement spread across the land. Envious the evil monsters banded together in
[11061.24s -> 11067.48s]  a desperate campaign against the good-hearted villagers. Luckily Zach and Jack learned about
[11067.48s -> 11074.54s]  the plot and prepared for the assault. Surrender or we'll tear your town apart. We'll never give
[11074.54s -> 11094.40s]  in. Taste our bullets. What? Why is it only two monsters? Why are you only attacking with
[11094.40s -> 11109.88s]  one fish? Hold down left boss button. The guy on the top is doing all the work. Can I speed this
[11109.88s -> 11125.92s]  up? Catch it. Machine gun. This is actually kind of good. Bonuses and red circles have a
[11125.92s -> 11139.52s]  negative effect. Avoid them. This game. Good choice. Who picked this? Excellent choice.
[11140.32s -> 11156.17s]  Avoid bullets or hit me. I need to up the difficulty. That's the super weapon and then
[11156.17s -> 11171.13s]  you right click to activate a super weapon. Very effective. This machine is harmless but
[11171.13s -> 11184.89s]  soap bubbles it launches will hinder you. It's not harmless. Your rank is private.
[11206.46s -> 11210.41s]  I could hear the audible gasp in the audience there when I didn't get that.
[11216.46s -> 11230.94s]  Five. This game had upgrades. I could see myself playing this on like mini clip
[11231.58s -> 11240.33s]  three or four hours straight. Shitty games with banging soundtracks.
[11240.33s -> 11263.32s]  The stream. Not necessarily wrong. Rename the stream. Shitty games. Well, bad games
[11263.32s -> 11289.82s]  with banging soundtracks. I'm pretty much already done. I want a boss though. I'm
[11289.82s -> 11301.02s]  gonna say level one. Location one level five is gonna be the boss. I have to see
[11301.02s -> 11310.43s]  the first boss. Mute this one and do the sound effects. There's no way. I'm
[11310.43s -> 11352.46s]  not. I'm only human. I don't have to overlap sound effects. Not fast enough.
[11362.25s -> 11364.49s]  All right. There's the boss. I'm ready. I'm ready for the boss. I'm ready.
[11369.21s -> 11386.01s]  That's the guy from the cover. We just saw the ears monster. Now I can end this happily.
[11394.49s -> 11424.12s]  Incoming large enemy. I thought that was it. Two gumbos. Art. Art's not bad.
[11426.75s -> 11446.75s]  Game's relatively fun. It's a little easy. It's kind of a fun game. I can't click the X.
[11447.79s -> 11471.76s]  What happens if I get bite? Can you lose? They're just... holy shit. That was
[11472.72s -> 11498.49s]  Let's cover it up. I hate this wallpaper. Well, I'm sorry. I'll change it if I get a good one.
[11499.05s -> 11516.65s]  This next one is either pyramid escape or island maze escape. That looks like pyramid.
[11520.06s -> 11534.14s]  I can see the bottom of that. That's pyramid escape. Give it a whirl. Please wait a bit.
[11534.14s -> 11540.28s]  This window won't appear again is what this says. Why is there a countdown? What do you
[11540.28s -> 11552.75s]  mean? What are you doing? Why? Oh, all right. Hold on. The way to the treasure is shown on this
[11552.75s -> 11559.08s]  map. This road might lead there. Full speed ahead. Have you seen that? Oh my god. You
[11559.08s -> 11580.12s]  got to see this. It's fucking outrageous. I knew what was waiting for him ahead. No one
[11580.12s -> 11585.24s]  managed to avoid our trap to escape alive. We'll have a real cool time.
[11585.24s -> 11607.20s]  I remember this one. Remember? I remember.
[11607.20s -> 11642.86s]  Prize on his back. Just fine. Look at the game world. This game world has been created
[11642.86s -> 11648.30s]  especially for novices and kids. This game world has been created for more professional players.
[11656.84s -> 11706.33s]  Gameplay demonstration. That was a pretty good move. Can I get it?
[11708.28s -> 11715.26s]  Got that one. Two more? I think I can drop these guys down.
[11718.57s -> 11720.49s]  Right through here and then grab this last one. That's it.
[11735.39s -> 11742.83s]  Shift Z X. Move the cursor. Dig a hole. Why didn't you do this in the gameplay
[11742.83s -> 11789.63s]  demonstration for me? What the hell is that? I can't move. Just dig down. I can't.
[11813.07s -> 11823.08s]  Try this one. Supposed to be the easy one.
[11844.11s -> 11850.99s]  You got to be kidding me. Lost to pyramid escape. Yeah, I did. But that doesn't embarrass
[11850.99s -> 11870.32s]  me at all. Oh no, I lost to pyramid escape. Suck and what? Oh no, that's seek.
[11872.86s -> 11883.48s]  I thought it said something else. Because my window is a lot smaller because I'm not
[11883.48s -> 11891.85s]  full-screened over here on OBS. That's why I'm reading these so incorrectly.
[11894.36s -> 11905.20s]  Seek and find collection. We're getting close to the end here. Seek and find. Oh no,
[11905.20s -> 11924.01s]  is that not seek and find? No, it is. That's seek and find. Oh, where the hell is that
[11924.01s -> 11928.81s]  though? Game one. Is that on? Because I had to chop up a couple of them because they were
[11928.81s -> 11948.84s]  too big. There it is. Seek and find collection one. Let's go. All right, what clicking for
[11948.84s -> 11968.08s]  now? Old bedroom. Southwestern room. Flower riot. We're gonna do flower riot. Click anywhere
[11968.08s -> 11977.05s]  on either image where you spot a difference. Find all seven before time runs out. Yep,
[11977.05s -> 11990.81s]  that's green. Look at all these chatters here. Rioting. Um, there's too many colors.
[11990.81s -> 11999.16s]  I can't do it. Yeah, I see that one. This is horrible. I feel like if I lean
[11999.16s -> 12021.32s]  in and cross my eyes, I'm gonna see a magic eye image. This is a jump scare game. Yeah,
[12021.32s -> 12024.76s]  it is. It's the same kind of... All right, you guys do it. I can't look at it anymore.
[12027.20s -> 12031.12s]  I can't. My brain... Do you find them please so we can get out of this?
[12036.04s -> 12043.02s]  Nice, good job. Nice, good work. I already got that one. All right, which one over here?
[12043.02s -> 12047.82s]  What are you trying to get over here? I already got that one. We only have 224 seconds.
[12048.54s -> 12073.96s]  Doesn't this the one that boos at you if you don't do it? All right, come on. Help me. I honestly,
[12073.96s -> 12079.74s]  I think I broke the extension. I've used this. I've restarted it and turned it back on so many
[12079.74s -> 12084.38s]  times that I may have destroyed it. I might have to reinstall the extension after this.
[12089.66s -> 12104.00s]  Nice work. Power riot mirror. Oh my god, that's even worse. No, thank you.
[12106.33s -> 12136.68s]  Sitting room. No, I don't want to. No. Thirsty. Anybody else here thirsty? I need like more drink.
[12137.40s -> 12144.78s]  I need like a tall glass of water. I'm gonna go. I need to hydrate. You guys vote. I'll be
[12144.78s -> 12149.34s]  right back. Sorry this is the second break in like less than three or four hours, but I'm
[12149.34s -> 12153.18s]  gonna go grab the water because I had like a Coke and I don't want that anymore. I want
[12153.18s -> 12256.11s]  like a tall glass of cold water. Be right back. Okay, all right. I'm hydrated. I'm good to go.
[12256.83s -> 12271.10s]  Where are we going? I don't know where this is being clicked on. I'm gonna say that's
[12271.10s -> 12295.21s]  island escape. If I were to take a guess, island maze escape. Good luck. I mean I got a screen
[12295.21s -> 12328.22s]  here. Oh, it wanted to work. No, it didn't. V-sync. Be very careful because this one is
[12329.31s -> 12340.04s]  on the edge. Go ahead and do this. Drag it down. This one's so cute. Wait till you guys see this.
[12347.79s -> 12370.88s]  Island maze escape. I just fucking ruined it. No, I didn't. Let's go. Kids play or standard?
[12372.16s -> 12380.62s]  One. I tried to solve. What am I solving?
[12381.50s -> 12425.64s]  What do you solve? Solve it. I'm not sure what I'm solving here. So why can't I not walk?
[12425.64s -> 12429.16s]  Is it because of the different shapes? I can't walk backwards now.
[12431.50s -> 12446.36s]  Fucked up here. Walk back this way. The clicks don't register.
[12455.96s -> 12465.84s]  60% of every click doesn't work. All right. You saw that like how many times did I click
[12465.84s -> 12480.78s]  that? Two. One. One. What the fuck was that? Two. Three. Three clicks. One. One. One. Two. Three.
[12482.84s -> 12490.91s]  What? Why is it randomizing the amount of clicks it takes me to go?
[12493.88s -> 12512.41s]  Do it. I'm just gonna spam it. That's how you do it. I have to click as fast as I can.
[12512.41s -> 12538.62s]  Click and hold. It's not doing anything. Literally. Literally. Why? Get over there. Go! Oh, my fingers!
[12542.40s -> 12562.91s]  I need to listen. Get it in this bright spot. Mute the fucking audio. You ready?
[12577.37s -> 12603.23s]  I can't get back there now. I can't do it anymore. I can't do it. I'm sorry.
[12604.51s -> 12620.97s]  I guess he wasn't lying. That's a first. We think I'm just making up this shit all the time.
[12623.07s -> 12627.39s]  What do you mean he's not lying? If I say something's happening, I'm not going to pretend
[12627.39s -> 12651.84s]  that it's not like it's happening. For what? Why would I do that? Oh, it was left click. It
[12651.84s -> 12680.78s]  was left click. Yeah. All right. Where is that? That was called click between three and seven
[12680.78s -> 12689.85s]  times to get the character to move one space. Mind numbing. No, don't click on that. It's
[12689.85s -> 12711.32s]  not what's going on. I see 29% over here. 29% currently on garden land tycoon. Okay. Let's
[12711.32s -> 12728.94s]  give it a try. I'm going to have to change this. Casual Force Entertainment is the name of this
[12728.94s -> 12738.24s]  company. Cool. It's been over 24 hours and he's still going. Yeah, the stream has not turned
[12738.24s -> 12759.92s]  off. I know everybody wants to meet it, but it's one of those things where it sneaks away
[12759.92s -> 12777.74s]  when I click. That's not bad right there. All right. I'm ready. This what is called
[12777.74s -> 12792.76s]  garden land tycoon. You didn't hear the music. Harvest five bags of sunflower seeds to complete
[12792.76s -> 12797.64s]  this level. This is the number of points you'll earn for completing the level minus 100 points.
[12797.64s -> 12801.80s]  Okay. You will also earn bonus points depending on how fast you complete the level.
[12801.80s -> 12807.88s]  Click on the close button. Planning spot. Sunflower seeds. Now click on the sunflower
[12807.88s -> 12816.56s]  seeds to get an action menu. Water. The watering level of your sunflower can earn an additional
[12816.56s -> 12820.72s]  heart. The more hearts you earn, the more produce you'll harvest. Watering levels decrease
[12820.72s -> 12835.88s]  over time so keep an eye on them. Do the dirt thing. Mute the music. Why? I hate games like
[12835.88s -> 12857.68s]  this. Please clap along with the music. Why? Is it desynced? I don't know why it's always
[12857.68s -> 12901.16s]  desynced. Is that not synced? What is the delay coming from? Some weird OBS delay going on.
[12905.21s -> 12928.83s]  Here are your points. That's weird track that's taking the game. Remember this is
[12928.83s -> 12938.64s]  literally a quake ripoff. What the fuck? Play something else. You're right. I don't want to
[12938.64s -> 12958.81s]  give time to a game that's a quake ripoff. That was boring. Boring. We're getting real close.
[12959.53s -> 12970.03s]  There's only like 15 more. I think it might be that time to start opening them. They're
[12970.03s -> 12973.87s]  just blowing through them. Does it open? Yes or no? And yes? All right. Let's go.
[12974.51s -> 12989.04s]  All right. Where we going? Right in the middle. Flower garden tycoon. Oh my fucking
[12989.04s -> 13002.83s]  god. This is the same game? Flower land tycoon. Flower garden tycoon. It hurts my ears. I'm going
[13002.83s -> 13010.44s]  to mute that because it's going to hurt yours too. This hurts very badly. Holy shit. This is
[13010.44s -> 13037.07s]  terrifying. Hold on. That's why everybody wanted me to play this so badly. I wonder if this
[13037.07s -> 13041.87s]  one's any different. The lady is more scary than anything. All right. Audio should be fine.
[13042.75s -> 13066.01s]  My gardens. New garden. This one. Clean the screen. What's going on? Oh, it's actually just
[13066.01s -> 13294.56s]  a garden simulator. Give me one second. Oh, I forgot to talk. I haven't been talking for like
[13294.56s -> 13313.13s]  two or three straight minutes. I was too locked in here. Wait. It's worth it. Trust me.
[13313.85s -> 13340.28s]  I'm going to mute a bunch of stuff for now. Just wait one second. No, it's going to take too long.
[13340.28s -> 13345.82s]  It's going to take too long. I was going to have like 30 gnomes looping this loop and then
[13345.82s -> 13395.58s]  like fucking like, nevermind. It's going to take so long. All right. Here we go. You guys
[13395.58s -> 13453.61s]  right. I don't want to get gnomed anymore. Okay. No more of that. That was that was that was a
[13453.61s -> 13462.97s]  telling. That was that was every time I've ever been gnomed. This should be just throwing it
[13462.97s -> 13488.67s]  hitting the X button. All right. Where are we going? I think I just I just caused my internet
[13489.23s -> 13502.28s]  have a problem from that one. Like dropping frames now. I angered the fucking gnome gods
[13504.16s -> 13518.04s]  sacrificing every gnome joke. Stop doing it. Dick. All right. Where was the where was it?
[13518.04s -> 13530.59s]  I don't even know where the hell this is. No. Oh, it's right here. Okay.
[13531.98s -> 13541.21s]  Where was that gnome? I don't know the hell it is. It was called garden mania or something.
[13541.21s -> 13551.85s]  Garden fun. All right. It's time for streamers choice. Put the fire on instead of the X.
[13553.95s -> 13568.28s]  My computer will crash. I don't even know where it is. Where is it? It's right here.
[13568.28s -> 13572.89s]  All right. There you go. That one's currently on fire. You guys are real funny.
[13572.89s -> 13577.47s]  This is hysterical stuff. I mean, we're talking just like talk. All right. It's time
[13577.47s -> 13589.52s]  for streamers choice. I'm just going to go through them. There's only like 10 or 15 more.
[13590.24s -> 13597.55s]  All right. You've lost it. Privilege is gone. Somebody said I legit want mystic diamonds.
[13598.11s -> 13616.60s]  So that's what I'm going to click on mystic diamonds. Sure. I wonder the internet is kind
[13616.60s -> 13620.25s]  of having a problem. Sometimes it does this maybe once every couple of weeks.
[13621.23s -> 13628.89s]  Since the when it was fixed permanently, we drop a few thousand frames usually fixes itself.
[13629.45s -> 13639.20s]  So all right. Where is that? What was it called? I don't even remember what it was. Help me out
[13639.20s -> 13677.90s]  here. What was it called? All right. There it is. Mystic diamonds. Mystic diamonds. All right.
[13677.90s -> 13704.80s]  Options. Can I full screen it? I can. I'm getting into a fit here and I got to get myself.
[13707.88s -> 13716.16s]  I have to get myself. Okay. Quest. Pirate ship is mission one. Whoa.
[13717.12s -> 13735.69s]  Wow. There's a lady flying. Whoa. I can. Hold on. You can drag it. This is a match three with
[13735.69s -> 13756.00s]  hacks. This is no clip match three. Tetris. No clip match three. This is cool. What have
[13756.00s -> 13777.23s]  you said to play this? Good job. Good work. There is no limit. There are actually no limits.
[13777.79s -> 13782.27s]  I can go as far as I want or as short as I want or as small as I want or as big as I want.
[13786.06s -> 13819.36s]  No limitations. I just pogchamped myself into a headache. How did that happen?
[13820.48s -> 13840.33s]  I pogchamped too hard. What's that? Slow down. Wait. Watch this row. That's a problem if it
[13840.33s -> 13845.36s]  comes up here. Come on. All right. Now I think it's safe for me to be able to go like this.
[13854.11s -> 13869.24s]  Uh oh. Wait. Come on. There are no limitations. That's what I keep forgetting.
[13870.04s -> 13881.90s]  Just drag it from anywhere. All right. I gotta stop doing that. I'm actually going to give myself
[13881.90s -> 13897.31s]  fucking migraine. What? I can hear him. I can hear him. Pogchamping.
[13898.03s -> 13916.59s]  Like all these little breathing and mouth noises. Oh my god. Oh, that was, that joke was funny,
[13916.59s -> 13942.83s]  but that one wasn't. Minus. I didn't even get it. Yes. Again. Again. Again. We'll do it
[13942.83s -> 14009.82s]  again. We'll do it again. Wait. Wait. I get him. Nice. No. No, no. I gotta take, I gotta
[14009.82s -> 14013.10s]  take a break. I gotta take a break from physical comedy after what happened yesterday. I was
[14013.10s -> 14016.94s]  about to just fly back in the chair as hard as I could with an open mouth and I would have
[14016.94s -> 14020.14s]  got hurt and it would have been another one of those, oh wow, you'd like hit yourself.
[14020.78s -> 14072.20s]  I'm taking a physical comedy break after yesterday. Stuck in laughing. What's happening
[14072.20s -> 14119.16s]  here? Oh, I got it. I missed it. Gotta love that 10 second loop. Yeah, that was a good one.
[14119.16s -> 14135.00s]  Actually kind of fun game. That was that one called enchanted squares, mystic diamonds.
[14135.00s -> 14140.16s]  Gold runner? Yeah. Let's just go. I mean, are you really going to vote on like another,
[14140.16s -> 14148.80s]  there's like eight on the board. Gold runner. Let's just go. Let's do it. Where is it? You
[14148.80s -> 14177.60s]  guys just have to help me find them. There it is. Thank you. Gold runner. It's not gold
[14177.60s -> 14207.45s]  runner. There it is. I know, I don't even know what the song is. Is that a, is that snake
[14207.45s -> 14224.88s]  rattle and roll? I can't even, what the fuck? Bricks legends. Is it supposed to look like that?
[14226.38s -> 14230.62s]  That's her bricks legends. I think this game might be a little bit broken.
[14233.32s -> 14279.26s]  I don't think that one works. Gold runner. What else is here? We've got a hunt for treasure.
[14279.26s -> 14297.44s]  Might as well give hunt for treasure a try. Cash games. Probably hidden object.
[14300.94s -> 14324.97s]  If it's going to be. Did he notice? Did I notice what? What was I supposed to notice?
[14332.62s -> 14339.95s]  All right. Welcome graphics. Play relaxed mode. Complete the tutorial and learn the basics.
[14339.95s -> 14343.23s]  Find all the items on the list. There's more, somebody like burnt something.
[14344.03s -> 14349.07s]  Uh-huh. Find all the items in the scene. Look closely as they might be well concealed.
[14349.71s -> 14357.21s]  You can also find coins. Don't tell, what's going on? What are you talking about?
[14364.52s -> 14372.20s]  700,000 pre-recorded streams. You guys just play. I don't fucking care. I mean, let's be real.
[14389.80s -> 14399.48s]  Yes. Click dog. All right. Stop giving me tips. It's not the parrot.
[14400.83s -> 14406.54s]  Parrot. It's getting darker. Why are we blacking out?
[14406.54s -> 14447.28s]  Oh, diary. You click on the diary. None of you have found one item. Really? Moon out window.
[14449.44s -> 14460.11s]  I'm clicking on the spots you guys clicked on. There's nothing here. Click dog. I already did.
[14470.20s -> 14478.20s]  Why do you have an umbrella in your fridge? This person's fucked. This person. All right,
[14478.20s -> 14481.08s]  get the dick off the screen for a second and realize what we're looking at here.
[14481.64s -> 14490.44s]  This person has, they have an umbrella, a bowling pin, and a fire extinguisher in their
[14490.60s -> 14500.16s]  fridge, a mousetrap, a microphone, and they have poison.
[14507.26s -> 14511.34s]  This person has got so many issues. I don't even know where to start.
[14516.81s -> 14527.76s]  Imagine putting some of this shit in a full watermelon.
[14535.39s -> 14540.28s]  Two cooked lobsters in a balloon. Oh, this is slaying me.
[14549.21s -> 14555.28s]  One huge carrot. A fucking giant carrot. A live chicken.
[14579.84s -> 14590.25s]  The ice cream has a shell. There's so, there's so much in here that's worthy of dissecting.
[14590.25s -> 14594.01s]  This does not belong in the fridge. This belongs on the counter. It's a salt shaker.
[14594.09s -> 14605.90s]  A full birthday cake. All this stuff in here probably stinks. Imagine storing a cooked crab
[14605.90s -> 14609.18s]  next to a birthday cake and none of them are in any type of storage.
[14609.90s -> 14622.48s]  This cake is going to taste like dead salty crab fish. Oh, I can't handle that anymore.
[14622.48s -> 14637.85s]  I gotta go back. Oh my god. I don't even know. There's a baseball in the fridge, isn't
[14637.85s -> 14646.83s]  there? I need to stay here because there might be another scenario where there's another
[14646.83s -> 14663.18s]  fridge with stuff in it. I need a truck and a pencil. I didn't, I accidentally just clicked
[14663.18s -> 14684.80s]  on that. Where's the truck? Can anybody see a truck? Okay, keys. Are they keys?
[14695.39s -> 14696.83s]  I don't care. Just give it to me.
[14698.75s -> 14721.95s]  All right. Items to use. Puzzles to solve. Items to use. It's flying the plane.
[14746.36s -> 14751.08s]  My name is Gordon Jones. I'd like to come in. I called you about your grandfather's
[14751.08s -> 14754.44s]  disappearance. His plane vanished and stormed over the Pacific Ocean.
[14755.32s -> 14760.46s]  His dialogue options. Was he alone on the plane? Yes, your grandfather was a great pilot
[14760.46s -> 14766.19s]  and had rented a light plane for a day trip. How did he get caught up in the storm? I
[14766.19s -> 14770.99s]  don't know. He had access to the local weather report before he left. By the way,
[14770.99s -> 14776.03s]  do you know his company specializes in treasure hunting? Of course. Grandpa loves stories
[14776.03s -> 14784.35s]  about lost treasure. I want you to meet Dick Robinson. A German character name. His assistant.
[14803.95s -> 14807.39s]  I had the honor of working with your grandfather. He told me a lot about you.
[14809.48s -> 14811.96s]  Which treasure was grandpa seeking when he disappeared?
[14812.60s -> 14817.96s]  Our last quest ended in failure. We spent a year looking for an empty tomb.
[14818.68s -> 14825.37s]  I bet grandpa was upset. He was. Someone found the tomb and raided it right when we got there.
[14826.83s -> 14830.27s]  Shortly before his disappearance, he asked me to draw up his will.
[14830.27s -> 14833.87s]  According to this document, if he dies, the company is yours.
[14834.83s -> 14842.35s]  I'm his only heir? Correct. However, the will includes the condition you must satisfy,
[14842.35s -> 14848.78s]  and I admit it's quite unusual. That's just like grandpa. I'd be surprised if
[14849.42s -> 14854.96s]  all I needed to do was sign it. You'll have a limited amount of time in which to find the
[14854.96s -> 14861.04s]  items mentioned in the will. Do you agree to its conditions? Sure, this is going to be fun.
[14861.76s -> 14865.76s]  If time runs out, the company gets a new owner or is put up for sale.
[14874.64s -> 14878.88s]  Hey, that's Fang. He's from South America. During one of my trips there,
[14878.88s -> 14882.32s]  he clamped onto my boots so hard we had no choice but to adopt him.
[14883.42s -> 14891.77s]  Thanks. I got time. Let's go. Help. We're staying in this one. This one's great.
[14893.31s -> 14896.75s]  And grandpa, you sure were fucked up putting paintings on the ceiling.
[14897.39s -> 14906.97s]  Okay, why? Why are these paintings up here? They're all crooked. Grandpa took a baseball
[14906.97s -> 14910.81s]  bat to his house and just started putting like command strips on the ceiling.
[14914.35s -> 14923.79s]  Horse. We've got a skull. That's not it. That's not it.
[14923.79s -> 14933.87s]  Net tortoise on stairs. Yeah, but I can't click it. Net key butterfly.
[14934.91s -> 14956.16s]  What are you guys looking? Horse. Refresh. Net horse butterfly key. How much time is left?
[14959.77s -> 14963.85s]  I can't go in a key at the bottom of an aquarium guarded by a piranha. That's grandpa
[14963.85s -> 14979.12s]  for you. It must be hungry. We can't go in there. The time. Guys, guys, I'm about
[14979.12s -> 14989.77s]  to lose the company. I'm about to lose the company. That's a golf club. Why are you clicking
[14989.77s -> 15012.32s]  on the golf club? None of these are right. It's locked. Nobody clicked on the thermostat.
[15012.32s -> 15031.16s]  That's not even. What? Why? Oh, I get it. You guys are clicking on the bullseye.
[15036.11s -> 15042.27s]  This is fucking stupid. Where is a net? I already clicked on the horse. Give me another
[15042.27s -> 15048.91s]  one. What? Sometimes the dark hides important things. It looks like there's something behind
[15048.91s -> 15061.20s]  the plant. Use the net on the piranha. All right. Get out of here. I can do it myself. I can.
[15063.47s -> 15070.89s]  Net on piranha. Great. Now we can get the key without losing an arm. Get the key. Key goes
[15070.89s -> 15077.45s]  into the cabinet. Key on cabinet. Great. Now let's look inside. Might contain the items we
[15077.45s -> 15091.21s]  need. God, what a disaster. Okay. Got the calendar. Ruler, butterfly, horse, eraser.
[15093.13s -> 15098.59s]  Horse. I don't even know what it's bubble tape. Okay. Horse, ruler, eraser.
[15102.30s -> 15118.91s]  Uh oh. Uh oh. Horse, ruler, eraser, butterfly. Horse, ruler, horse, eraser, butterfly.
[15118.91s -> 15125.53s]  Horse, ruler. Coin. Horse, ruler, eraser, butterfly.
[15128.57s -> 15132.46s]  Grandpa taking his wedding ring off. What the fuck is up with that?
[15133.42s -> 15150.88s]  Eraser. Top left corner. Re. All right. Got it. Butterfly. Horse, butterfly. Behind.
[15163.37s -> 15167.37s]  That's a picture of a horse. That doesn't count. That's a picture of a horse.
[15172.44s -> 15189.10s]  Okay. Where's the butterfly? You fucking gotta be kidding me. Okay. Got it.
[15190.30s -> 15193.68s]  Found all the items. Where's Chad?
[15193.68s -> 15198.88s]  Chad. Now what?
[15222.86s -> 15250.96s]  Is there something we need to be doing? By the clue. I don't have a map. I'm going...
[15253.66s -> 15258.00s]  A dry plant? No one's been in here for a long time. No one has entered your
[15258.00s -> 15267.58s]  grandfather's office since he disappeared. It's a watering can. Bell number.
[15268.38s -> 15276.35s]  And the ship. That's a ship right there. Fuck off. That's a ship.
[15284.44s -> 15289.48s]  Here comes a blue screen of death. Click the link. Click the link. Wait. Hold on.
[15289.48s -> 15313.69s]  What do you want to click? That's a new background.
[15315.07s -> 15319.10s]  Oh god. I think the internet just died. Are we still alive?
[15319.82s -> 15325.23s]  I just like dumped out on the internet. I think we're still alive.
[15325.87s -> 15328.33s]  We're going to be running into another problem.
[15332.00s -> 15343.79s]  Yeah. I gotta make this right. Hold on. No. Just keep it where it was. It was fine where it was.
[15344.51s -> 15370.81s]  Uh oh. We're going through hell right now. Hold on to your hats. I'm currently trying
[15370.81s -> 15374.89s]  to wait out this latest internet hiccup. All right. Let's see what we got.
[15376.09s -> 15378.41s]  How is that a ship? But that isn't. Up there.
[15380.57s -> 15394.44s]  Huh? That makes no sense. That's a ship up there. Zoom in. I should try spinning it and
[15394.44s -> 15401.05s]  inspecting it from all sides. It looks like something is written on this side of the globe.
[15401.61s -> 15405.29s]  Five. Oh my god. This is going to be unbearable.
[15405.85s -> 15411.32s]  Just so I thought it's locked. I need to open this safe. Classic model made in 1957.
[15411.32s -> 15413.64s]  Unfortunately, your grandfather was the only person who knew the code.
[15414.44s -> 15426.12s]  All right. Are you guys going to behave? Come on. Help me out here. This is a tough game.
[15426.84s -> 15436.57s]  All right. There's a watering can. You found a large watering can. Water the dried plant.
[15438.49s -> 15441.45s]  That's not how that works. I just sat in this room for like three months.
[15442.49s -> 15448.65s]  I'm probably fucking starving right now. Is that a ship? Oh, it's a bell.
[15449.29s -> 15461.85s]  It's not the piggy bank. Flower, weight, bell, and number. Bell? That's a number. Holy fuck. How
[15461.85s -> 15479.87s]  did you see that? Bell. Nice catch on the bell there. Shit. Coin. There's a coin right there.
[15480.83s -> 15510.08s]  Alligator. I need a flower and a weight and a boomerang. Flower. Click the flower.
[15513.72s -> 15519.48s]  Oh it's the plant did that. I would that that was whatever. I was thinking of like another
[15519.48s -> 15523.40s]  I don't know. I thought that was part of the game world. Not part of the actual thing to click
[15523.40s -> 15548.59s]  on. Knight's glove. Not down there. Bell. Looks like it but it's not.
[15551.15s -> 15555.53s]  Nothing in that bottle. Uh-oh. It's going dark.
[15555.85s -> 15562.11s]  That's it right there. Give me a break. I know it. That's a hand.
[15565.31s -> 15580.65s]  What? Is that not a hand? That's not a glove. Somehow. Where's the knight's glove then?
[15583.66s -> 15604.91s]  That's a fork. I need to enhance. Click on the curtain. This computer is blue screened.
[15608.41s -> 15617.10s]  Dude's computer has just been blue screened forever. That's not a knight's glove.
[15620.36s -> 15634.70s]  God damn it. None of this is working. There it is. What is this?
[15638.97s -> 15649.66s]  No that's a boxing glove. Boxing glove. Where's a bell?
[15655.16s -> 15658.44s]  Oh everyone's freaking out and clicking over here. Where's the bell?
[15664.68s -> 15678.51s]  I clicked that like three times. There's the boomerang. Number bell and a weight.
[15679.07s -> 15706.72s]  Grandpa why did you make this so horrible? That's not a bell that's a pawn. Bell on the chandelier
[15706.72s -> 15713.48s]  but is there though? I keep clicking here and it's not doing anything. Why are we still playing
[15713.48s -> 15722.14s]  this? Because I need another fridge scenario. That looks like a weight doesn't it? All right
[15722.14s -> 15727.10s]  what the fuck are they talking about? It was the number two. Two six one five.
[15731.26s -> 15735.10s]  Yes I thought it's locked. Two six. I know. Two six one five. Open the safe.
[15738.68s -> 15745.40s]  Let's try one six one five. Abracadabra. And it didn't open because that's not what this says.
[15748.38s -> 15749.50s]  You got it wrong.
[15753.98s -> 15754.94s]  Abracadabra.
[15758.94s -> 15772.48s]  That's so funny. Diary. Let's say grandpa's social security number. Key bell and weight.
[15772.48s -> 15776.08s]  There's another bell and there was a weight in here somewhere probably right?
[15776.08s -> 15803.15s]  I don't see a weight. I don't need those car keys. Wait a minute. iPhone. Coin. Two coins.
[15811.31s -> 15811.95s]  Top left.
[15811.95s -> 15840.04s]  In front of the gold statue. That's a gun. All right help me out here.
[15840.04s -> 15880.68s]  Oh look who it is. Wait. Wait. How is this my desktop background but I don't have the image?
[15881.24s -> 15899.37s]  I have to get these ready to have them come up when they pop up.
[15901.84s -> 15909.50s]  I'm gonna add image. These are fucking perfect. But the hell am I even saving these to?
[15910.14s -> 15912.99s]  Save to the... Does this one have an alpha channel?
[15913.63s -> 15936.96s]  Now we're gonna get these set up. So they're always right here.
[15949.84s -> 15953.84s]  And then make sure that he is in the right spot. He is. Okay.
[15954.72s -> 15988.64s]  I'm gonna add the other guy. Okay. All right. I'm ready. Let's go.
[15989.76s -> 15996.16s]  What the fuck is this? It's another person. No there are two people. Two.
[15997.13s -> 16005.92s]  Oh Gordon Jones I presume. Yes. My name is Richard Rosenberg. I have a business proposal
[16006.00s -> 16013.24s]  for you. Do we talk in private? Sure. Let's go to my grandfather's. I mean to my office.
[16015.31s -> 16019.31s]  As I said I have a business proposal in which you might be interested.
[16019.31s -> 16021.31s]  I'd like to purchase your grandfather's company.
[16026.24s -> 16028.40s]  Why didn't you approach my grandfather with this proposal?
[16029.56s -> 16033.40s]  I approached your grandfather several times but he didn't want to hear anything about
[16033.40s -> 16037.85s]  selling his business. I assume he had a reason for turning you down.
[16039.12s -> 16044.32s]  Only his stubbornness. Had he agreed he would have been living in a mansion right then.
[16044.32s -> 16048.08s]  But who knows where he is. What are you saying?
[16049.45s -> 16054.81s]  Nothing. I'm stating the facts. Now will you excuse me? I have urgent business to attend to.
[16055.53s -> 16073.00s]  How'd it go? He seemed to be a very unpleasant person. I'd rather step on a poisonous snake
[16073.00s -> 16079.42s]  than talk to him. Is he dangerous? Let me put it this way. He tends to engage in foul play
[16079.42s -> 16086.49s]  and do whatever he takes. It does whatever it is to achieve his goals. Who's that girl?
[16088.03s -> 16091.87s]  Catherine Queen. She's the leading treasure specialist in Rosenberg's company.
[16092.43s -> 16098.35s]  By the way she's a professor of archaeology. She majored in ancient cultures and graduated
[16098.35s -> 16104.75s]  with honors. So that's who we're competing against. I have a rather tactless question
[16104.75s -> 16109.80s]  to ask. What did he say to his proposal? I said I'd think about it but now I have
[16109.80s -> 16115.66s]  a feeling he didn't tell me the whole truth. Take my advice. Don't believe in a single word
[16115.66s -> 16121.66s]  he says. Then I'll definitely say no. At least until I figure out what this whole treasure
[16121.66s -> 16127.12s]  hunting thing is about. Besides, where else could I find such an exciting job?
[16127.84s -> 16135.37s]  Glad to hear it Mike. Welcome aboard. He needs to be off the screen.
[16135.37s -> 16145.18s]  And then he really turns... visit the museum and collect all known information
[16145.18s -> 16154.14s]  about the expedition. Oh nothing. Sometimes you can find very useful things in museums.
[16154.78s -> 16164.36s]  Let's start here. Can we find any treasures from the sunken ships in a museum?
[16164.36s -> 16168.86s]  Of course not. But we can find a clue that will lead us to them.
[16170.60s -> 16173.72s]  I had a more romantic picture of what a treasure hunting would be like.
[16175.00s -> 16178.44s]  I know. The treasure map of a spade and a chest full of gold.
[16179.69s -> 16184.68s]  A chest full of gold would be perfect right about now. What are you looking for?
[16186.72s -> 16190.32s]  Anything that relates to the archaeological expedition and the sunken ship.
[16203.61s -> 16210.81s]  Please. Please do not touch the exhibits. This is a museum after all.
[16210.81s -> 16213.13s]  Oh sorry about that. I didn't mean any harm.
[16214.72s -> 16220.32s]  Please be careful. Some of these items are so fragile a single touch can damage them.
[16221.44s -> 16227.53s]  The only problem with this museum is it doesn't allow anyone to use the exhibits
[16227.53s -> 16230.49s]  for personal reasons. That includes treasure hunters.
[16233.95s -> 16238.35s]  What do we do now? We distract the guards using the fire alarm.
[16239.07s -> 16241.79s]  What? How's that supposed to help?
[16243.28s -> 16248.00s]  They're instructed to evacuate all visitors and leave the premises when the fire alarm goes off.
[16250.67s -> 16252.99s]  Well we have to find a way to stay in the museum so...
[16253.71s -> 16257.84s]  We could get lost in here. There are so many nooks and crannies.
[16259.18s -> 16268.30s]  I know. Look at the guy back here.
[16269.42s -> 16285.71s]  Um excuse me. How do we get to the hall where they keep the artifacts from Greece?
[16294.52s -> 16305.16s]  Gordon. Gordon we can t look for anything in the museum as long as the attendant is watching us.
[16305.80s -> 16309.56s]  Let s activate the fire alarm to get rid of him.
[16309.56s -> 16311.56s]  Help me search for something that would help with that.
[16312.44s -> 16330.30s]  Alright let's go. Why am I still in this one?
[16334.04s -> 16340.72s]  Is there a reason why I'm still in this? What are you guys clicking?
[16341.44s -> 16352.75s]  I can't click anything unless it's the thing that you need to smoke?
[16352.75s -> 16356.32s]  Have a cigarette. Oh the fire alarm.
[16357.04s -> 16369.66s]  The museum s heat detector which is connected to the fire alarm.
[16369.66s -> 16386.46s]  Use a small flame to activate it. A lighter or cigarettes or something?
[16386.46s -> 16407.50s]  A lamp? I don't know how to do anything.
[16408.14s -> 16420.70s]  Trust this. Why did you just link this to me?
[16424.33s -> 16428.17s]  It's me like sucking on swallowing hot dogs.
[16429.20s -> 16431.92s]  This is not relevant at all to what we're doing.
[16432.56s -> 16436.72s]  Not even remotely close to anything going on on the screen right now.
[16437.36s -> 16451.60s]  I clicked on the wrong one. This one.
[16452.16s -> 16456.67s]  Oh my god. This one.
[16461.21s -> 16463.53s]  We have like 30 more games to play.
[16464.17s -> 16474.49s]  Alright I'm just gonna do the cheat code.
[16482.25s -> 16487.07s]  I already did this. I know I already clicked on that one.
[16487.07s -> 16498.62s]  I need something that makes heat. Heat.
[16499.58s -> 16513.47s]  Heat. There are matches on the ground.
[16513.47s -> 16514.35s]  I mean that's a necklace.
[16515.07s -> 16518.20s]  I'm using these hints. I know. I get it.
[16518.92s -> 16521.32s]  I have to buy some more coins.
[16521.96s -> 16526.38s]  Do I need to go back to the map?
[16527.18s -> 16539.87s]  Hold on. So wait you're telling me that I have to go back into grandpa's cabinet?
[16544.84s -> 16546.84s]  Cigarette. Cigarette. Cigarette.
[16548.75s -> 16550.11s]  Spider on glow.
[16551.23s -> 16552.35s]  Is it backtracking?
[16554.80s -> 16556.00s]  There is backtracking.
[16556.72s -> 16557.28s]  No it's not.
[16559.05s -> 16559.69s]  Yes there is.
[16560.65s -> 16562.17s]  Unfucking believable.
[16562.17s -> 16566.32s]  You're getting shit in me.
[16574.52s -> 16577.48s]  Attention! Do not panic! Everyone leave the building!
[16578.04s -> 16586.38s]  Hiding inside this sarcophagus was a great idea but aren't you worried about the curse of the pharaohs?
[16587.95s -> 16590.19s]  Don't worry. This is just a replica.
[16590.67s -> 16593.23s]  If you knock on it you can hear it's made of plastic.
[16594.19s -> 16596.11s]  It sounds like stone to me.
[16597.15s -> 16598.19s]  Sounds real to me.
[16598.83s -> 16600.99s]  But there's no point in worrying about that now.
[16600.99s -> 16602.27s]  We're already inside of it.
[16603.47s -> 16606.48s]  When was the last time you saw my grandfather?
[16607.52s -> 16608.80s]  Week before he disappeared.
[16609.44s -> 16611.20s]  Do you remember what you talked about?
[16612.00s -> 16614.27s]  He said he found something really big.
[16617.31s -> 16618.03s]  Something what?
[16618.91s -> 16622.65s]  He didn't tell me. I only know he was going to Paris after his vacation.
[16626.28s -> 16629.72s]  I never realized how uncomfortable and dusty the inside of our sarcophagus can be.
[16631.90s -> 16634.94s]  I haven't heard any mummies complaining.
[16635.66s -> 16639.10s]  Now come on. We don't have much time before the fire department gets here.
[16639.10s -> 16644.57s]  No that was just a match.
[16648.32s -> 16649.68s]  The door has a code lock.
[16649.68s -> 16650.96s]  I wonder what's behind it.
[16651.52s -> 16655.47s]  We only have to pick matching pairs of numbers to open it.
[16655.47s -> 16656.75s]  So we'll know soon enough.
[16657.31s -> 16675.45s]  We'll definitely find something useful in here.
[16709.93s -> 16710.33s]  Spider.
[16710.89s -> 16711.37s]  Film reel.
[16711.37s -> 16711.93s]  Sea compass.
[16711.93s -> 16712.65s]  Police helmet.
[16713.69s -> 16714.65s]  I mean that's a...
[16714.65s -> 16716.01s]  How is that not a police helmet?
[16719.95s -> 16721.87s]  Is that just a regular bike helmet?
[16721.87s -> 16722.19s]  How?
[16734.19s -> 16735.23s]  Film reel.
[16735.23s -> 16741.36s]  I know there's a scary cat in there.
[16741.36s -> 16741.84s]  I see it.
[16742.48s -> 16745.20s]  I need spy glasses.
[16750.52s -> 16751.16s]  A bottle?
[16751.16s -> 16752.80s]  I know those two are outside.
[16756.62s -> 16757.18s]  Lighthouse.
[16757.82s -> 16760.59s]  Let's get these out of the way.
[16760.59s -> 16761.31s]  They're both right here.
[16762.11s -> 16765.76s]  This is all wrong now.
[16765.76s -> 16766.40s]  Let me change it.
[16772.46s -> 16772.78s]  I know.
[16772.78s -> 16773.50s]  Don't click this.
[16773.50s -> 16775.10s]  I know everyone's going to go...
[16775.10s -> 16776.38s]  Cat! Click on the cat!
[16776.38s -> 16777.18s]  Click on the cat!
[16777.90s -> 16781.37s]  Why is it 100% up here?
[16781.37s -> 16782.78s]  There's nothing here.
[16782.78s -> 16791.61s]  Glass.
[16792.41s -> 16796.08s]  Lighthouse.
[16796.08s -> 16796.64s]  Sea compass.
[16796.64s -> 16797.36s]  Police helmet.
[16797.36s -> 16797.92s]  Sea compass.
[16799.29s -> 16800.01s]  Sea compass.
[16802.91s -> 16803.87s]  Sea compass.
[16803.87s -> 16805.55s]  A lot of S sound in that.
[16806.11s -> 16816.14s]  What are you looking at over here?
[16816.94s -> 16820.70s]  Why click on lady?
[16822.68s -> 16824.68s]  Well, that's a painting of a lighthouse.
[16824.68s -> 16825.32s]  Good work, guys.
[16826.04s -> 16832.40s]  I need three more spy glasses,
[16832.40s -> 16833.68s]  a sea compass, and a police helmet.
[16839.24s -> 16840.84s]  Everyone wanted me to go in here apparently.
[16841.72s -> 16848.08s]  Spy glass.
[16851.47s -> 16851.79s]  Coin.
[16853.16s -> 16856.40s]  Spy glasses.
[16856.40s -> 16858.08s]  Looking for spy glasses.
[16858.88s -> 16864.54s]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[16864.54s -> 16866.54s]  People are freaking out about the police.
[16866.54s -> 16866.86s]  Okay.
[16867.82s -> 16869.69s]  I don't...
[16869.69s -> 16871.53s]  I don't live in England.
[16871.53s -> 16871.77s]  Okay.
[16872.57s -> 16874.81s]  That's not what a police helmet looks like.
[16876.62s -> 16881.10s]  Where I am.
[16881.10s -> 16888.19s]  It didn't say click glasses.
[16890.06s -> 16890.62s]  Spy...
[16890.62s -> 16891.18s]  No.
[16891.18s -> 16892.38s]  Those are glasses, guys.
[16892.38s -> 16894.14s]  Those aren't spy glasses.
[16894.14s -> 16894.94s]  There's a difference.
[16899.18s -> 16899.90s]  Sea compass.
[16900.94s -> 16905.40s]  That doesn't do anything.
[16905.40s -> 16923.45s]  Go back to the cabinets.
[16924.33s -> 16926.19s]  Cabinet.
[16926.19s -> 16927.87s]  I can't believe I have to go back in a cabinet.
[16930.01s -> 16930.33s]  Wall.
[16930.33s -> 16931.21s]  No, this isn't even right.
[16931.21s -> 16932.17s]  This is all different now.
[16936.28s -> 16937.48s]  This is just the bonus level.
[16938.04s -> 16953.37s]  This equipment might be new, but it's not new.
[16953.93s -> 16954.89s]  It's still reliable.
[16955.45s -> 16956.51s]  Let's watch the movie.
[16957.31s -> 16957.55s]  Great.
[16957.55s -> 16958.35s]  We can watch the movie.
[16959.47s -> 16965.13s]  And 20 years ago when Grandpa Stevenson went down to the pyramids,
[16965.13s -> 16967.69s]  he found himself trapped underneath.
[16969.21s -> 16971.69s]  After 25 hours of nearly starving,
[16971.69s -> 16974.89s]  Grandpa ate his way out of the pyramids with a spoon.
[16975.77s -> 16977.53s]  The pyramids, if you did not know,
[16977.53s -> 16979.53s]  funnily enough, I made out of cinnamon sugar.
[16980.41s -> 16983.13s]  What the fuck is this supposed to be?
[16983.13s -> 16983.45s]  Okay.
[16983.45s -> 16984.09s]  Found the camel.
[16989.63s -> 16990.91s]  I was waiting for something to happen.
[16990.91s -> 16991.79s]  I was filling air there.
[17003.68s -> 17008.08s]  You motherfuckers clicking on this every time.
[17008.08s -> 17014.36s]  The fish is dead.
[17014.92s -> 17016.20s]  There's no reason to click this.
[17016.20s -> 17016.92s]  The fish is gone.
[17021.98s -> 17022.62s]  Golden egg.
[17023.42s -> 17026.88s]  I don't need to be here.
[17026.88s -> 17028.24s]  This is not progression.
[17028.24s -> 17029.98s]  This is not progressing the story.
[17030.62s -> 17039.26s]  I'm going back.
[17039.26s -> 17042.06s]  I need a sea compass and two spy glasses.
[17042.94s -> 17045.28s]  Get on it.
[17056.14s -> 17056.46s]  Nice.
[17057.18s -> 17060.56s]  Spy glass.
[17060.56s -> 17060.96s]  Come on.
[17061.60s -> 17062.16s]  Get on it.
[17091.37s -> 17092.97s]  Everyone does the same fucking thing.
[17094.16s -> 17096.00s]  You click on the cat eyes.
[17096.00s -> 17097.04s]  The glasses.
[17106.52s -> 17108.68s]  I just want to just find it.
[17111.61s -> 17112.73s]  There's nothing here.
[17112.73s -> 17113.37s]  Just buy one.
[17114.09s -> 17117.77s]  What is it telling me to click on?
[17117.77s -> 17118.57s]  There was nothing here.
[17119.45s -> 17119.69s]  Huh?
[17123.15s -> 17123.55s]  Fuck.
[17123.55s -> 17124.35s]  The last one's in here.
[17124.99s -> 17128.56s]  Got it.
[17128.56s -> 17141.63s]  I don't have to do this.
[17142.27s -> 17172.25s]  How do I get back to the fridge?
[17174.81s -> 17179.66s]  It had to be done.
[17180.22s -> 17181.52s]  I'm sorry.
[17181.52s -> 17182.16s]  That had to be done.
[17183.04s -> 17184.19s]  It did.
[17186.57s -> 17188.17s]  We were trapped in that one.
[17188.73s -> 17190.56s]  That was very fun.
[17191.36s -> 17192.96s]  But we were stuck there.
[17192.96s -> 17205.87s]  I know it was the only one that we liked.
[17206.43s -> 17208.80s]  But we gotta get through them.
[17211.98s -> 17212.62s]  What was that called?
[17212.62s -> 17213.98s]  A hunt for treasure.
[17213.98s -> 17218.86s]  Finished another stream.
[17219.42s -> 17223.80s]  I might just open it up one day.
[17223.80s -> 17227.13s]  All right.
[17227.13s -> 17227.77s]  Next.
[17227.77s -> 17232.06s]  What's the Tahiti hidden pearls?
[17232.14s -> 17233.98s]  It's the one that's right next to it.
[17233.98s -> 17234.62s]  Don't worry, guys.
[17234.62s -> 17235.26s]  You're gonna get to do it.
[17235.26s -> 17235.90s]  We're gonna do it again.
[17235.90s -> 17238.06s]  Because this is absolutely by probably the same company.
[17238.62s -> 17240.22s]  And it's probably just another version of it.
[17240.22s -> 17240.46s]  It is.
[17240.46s -> 17241.02s]  It has to be.
[17241.82s -> 17253.71s]  Okay.
[17254.35s -> 17255.15s]  This needs to be bigger.
[17264.12s -> 17264.44s]  Okay.
[17275.18s -> 17275.58s]  All right.
[17275.58s -> 17275.98s]  Let's go.
[17276.62s -> 17282.56s]  The legend of Princess Papith starts a long time ago.
[17282.56s -> 17287.60s]  On a beautiful day, King Pamir went to a magical place that was hidden deep inside
[17287.60s -> 17289.04s]  the Tahiti island.
[17289.04s -> 17290.72s]  There he discovered a magical pearl.
[17291.68s -> 17295.20s]  It was shining bright like the sun and blue like a clear sky.
[17295.92s -> 17299.76s]  He showed the magical pearl to his daughter, Papith, proudly,
[17299.76s -> 17302.48s]  who was intrigued by gems and pearls alike.
[17302.48s -> 17307.60s]  The pearl possessed a magical glance and the kingdom of Tahiti perished in its presence.
[17308.32s -> 17309.76s]  We are in need of your help, traveler.
[17309.76s -> 17313.36s]  In Tahiti, there are many tokens of mystery and magical items
[17313.36s -> 17315.92s]  to be found that will help you unravel the legend of Papith.
[17317.20s -> 17320.62s]  The hidden pearls of Tahiti contain the essence of Princess Papith.
[17321.82s -> 17324.22s]  Finding them and bringing them back together will help her.
[17324.22s -> 17327.02s]  You will travel to many locations and encounter many obstacles,
[17327.02s -> 17330.54s]  but the truth awaits those brave enough to endure the full journey.
[17331.10s -> 17334.22s]  Let us guide you in discovering the Tahiti hidden pearls.
[17336.24s -> 17337.52s]  Welcome to Tahiti.
[17337.52s -> 17339.28s]  I heard you are in need of a tour guide.
[17339.28s -> 17340.96s]  You wish to embark on a special journey.
[17341.60s -> 17343.92s]  I'd like to introduce you to a female tour guide, Ma'eva.
[17343.92s -> 17345.04s]  She takes care of adventures and
[17345.84s -> 17349.92s]  and seekers of mystical tales and lost fortune.
[17354.40s -> 17355.44s]  Hello, stranger.
[17355.44s -> 17357.92s]  I am one of the Tahiti tour guides and would love to show you around.
[17359.12s -> 17359.92s]  Since this is your first day,
[17359.92s -> 17361.68s]  I would like you to get familiar with the surroundings.
[17361.68s -> 17362.32s]  We will go.
[17362.32s -> 17363.52s]  It's just a hidden object, ma'am.
[17363.52s -> 17364.16s]  Hey, listen.
[17364.16s -> 17367.20s]  If it seems one of our guests has lost their guitar,
[17368.16s -> 17370.08s]  but I have to get back to the hotel.
[17370.08s -> 17371.36s]  Perhaps you could spot it.
[17371.36s -> 17372.88s]  You get an extra hint.
[17372.88s -> 17374.64s]  Find four hidden pearls in each level.
[17379.37s -> 17380.09s]  I'm not doing that.
[17380.73s -> 17383.07s]  If you click on the wrong thing,
[17383.07s -> 17384.67s]  it actually takes control of your computer.
[17396.62s -> 17397.66s]  There's a bike.
[17397.66s -> 17398.94s]  I didn't even click on a bike.
[17401.34s -> 17418.01s]  I don't want to do it.
[17418.01s -> 17419.61s]  We just did that too bad.
[17425.31s -> 17426.83s]  Seek and find collection two.
[17429.69s -> 17431.69s]  It's going to be a piece of shit just like the first one.
[17431.69s -> 17432.73s]  So don't worry.
[17432.73s -> 17433.85s]  You're not going to be missing much.
[17433.85s -> 17437.29s]  This one is paint sewing shop kids at play.
[17438.09s -> 17440.54s]  Let's do kids at play mirror.
[17440.54s -> 17455.53s]  Wait, wait, wait a second.
[17455.85s -> 17456.49s]  Wait a second.
[17458.88s -> 17459.68s]  What in the name?
[17466.68s -> 17468.12s]  What does the regular image look like?
[17478.65s -> 17479.29s]  What is this?
[17485.37s -> 17506.36s]  I don't...
[17506.36s -> 17508.36s]  So this is scary in one image.
[17508.36s -> 17510.20s]  One of these kids is missing.
[17521.56s -> 17530.40s]  That was a whole lot wrong.
[17530.96s -> 17533.28s]  That was something wrong there.
[17533.28s -> 17534.72s]  I don't want to play that one.
[17539.53s -> 17540.49s]  So where are we?
[17541.37s -> 17546.51s]  We have super staircase invaders,
[17550.86s -> 17552.22s]  star cosmic invaders.
[17552.22s -> 17553.34s]  Sorry, let me get that right.
[17557.87s -> 17566.46s]  Help you guys here.
[17567.66s -> 17574.14s]  Just terrible space invaders.
[17575.10s -> 17576.30s]  And it's so loud.
[17581.23s -> 17582.27s]  I got to be one level.
[17582.91s -> 17585.56s]  And then I'll be proud of myself.
[17585.56s -> 17586.20s]  Happy and done.
[17594.64s -> 17596.16s]  What's the big turtle ship dropping?
[17596.80s -> 17614.08s]  You can't play that for more than 30 seconds.
[17614.08s -> 17614.80s]  I don't think you can.
[17615.44s -> 17620.94s]  So then we got star...
[17620.94s -> 17622.14s]  Oh, it's by the same company.
[17622.14s -> 17625.34s]  Star cosmic invaders, star cosmic bust out.
[17626.06s -> 17635.18s]  Star cosmic bust out does not open.
[17635.90s -> 17641.69s]  How do you have one working out the other?
[17642.25s -> 17644.62s]  I don't know.
[17644.62s -> 17645.74s]  That seems impossible.
[17649.63s -> 17650.51s]  So what is left?
[17652.43s -> 17654.91s]  Let's give you a little bit of a tally here.
[17656.12s -> 17678.84s]  We've got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 14 remaining.
[17682.48s -> 17692.70s]  Only 14 remain, except for these.
[17692.78s -> 17696.86s]  Now, I'm going to give you guys a little bit of an insight here.
[17697.50s -> 17699.60s]  Two of these we've already done.
[17700.86s -> 17702.06s]  But these are...
[17703.20s -> 17704.56s]  There's not much in here.
[17704.56s -> 17705.44s]  Trust me.
[17705.44s -> 17706.56s]  None of these are worth opening.
[17711.28s -> 17712.72s]  Going from top to bottom.
[17715.53s -> 17719.13s]  This one is just Zuma, but like 500 levels.
[17719.93s -> 17723.45s]  This one is just a Zuma again, but with like a thousand levels.
[17723.45s -> 17726.25s]  This is also Zuma, but like 20,000 levels.
[17727.37s -> 17729.77s]  This is just Mahjong again.
[17729.77s -> 17731.77s]  There's like a hundred levels in Mahjong.
[17733.55s -> 17734.03s]  I'll do this one.
[17734.03s -> 17735.31s]  This is super crossword games.
[17735.31s -> 17736.19s]  That's kind of interesting.
[17738.24s -> 17739.44s]  Chess brain teasers.
[17739.44s -> 17740.64s]  There's a hundred thousand of them.
[17740.64s -> 17741.44s]  This stupid...
[17741.44s -> 17743.96s]  Why do I want to do that?
[17743.96s -> 17746.62s]  Mahjong, chess, solitaire.
[17746.62s -> 17748.46s]  Solitaire, solitaire, solitaire, solitaire.
[17751.07s -> 17756.32s]  Some of these aren't even worth opening.
[17756.32s -> 17764.25s]  2002 games is like, okay, maybe we'll click that one.
[17764.25s -> 17765.29s]  Giving an excuse.
[17765.29s -> 17766.41s]  Well, I'm just saying.
[17766.41s -> 17769.45s]  Let's just see where we are when we get done with these.
[17769.93s -> 17771.21s]  We still have 14 of these.
[17771.93s -> 17777.80s]  You have to at least open them.
[17777.80s -> 17778.91s]  I will.
[17778.91s -> 17780.75s]  Each one of those is getting 30 seconds.
[17781.47s -> 17782.03s]  I'm serious.
[17782.59s -> 17787.95s]  So that leaves us with...
[17788.51s -> 17789.71s]  Let's start the countdown here.
[17790.65s -> 17792.01s]  Well, not yet because we're at 14.
[17792.57s -> 17797.20s]  We're looking for down here in the lower left.
[17797.20s -> 17799.98s]  Let's get some of these done.
[17799.98s -> 17801.58s]  Volcanic blocks.
[17801.58s -> 17809.85s]  The game is being optimized for quick download.
[17809.85s -> 17812.73s]  This happens only at the first game start.
[17812.73s -> 17817.20s]  What was it downloading?
[17817.20s -> 17818.48s]  I already have it installed.
[17826.01s -> 17826.49s]  Virus.
[17837.26s -> 17837.98s]  Full screen.
[17837.98s -> 17839.18s]  Let's get it off full screen.
[17844.12s -> 17844.76s]  It is 3D.
[17845.40s -> 17858.19s]  I think this is a 3D version of Mahjong.
[17861.69s -> 17862.89s]  All right, play.
[17866.62s -> 17880.11s]  Oh, okay.
[17880.11s -> 17882.27s]  To throw a rune, click left mouse button.
[17883.47s -> 17886.11s]  You can only throw a rune when there's another rune in the way.
[17887.31s -> 17893.05s]  Combine three or more runes of the same color to destroy them.
[17893.05s -> 17895.45s]  Your task is to destroy all kinds of runes.
[17896.41s -> 17904.00s]  Yeah, it's just Zuma.
[17904.00s -> 17907.28s]  I told you we're at the point of the 700,000 games
[17907.92s -> 17909.68s]  where every game is now Zuma.
[17910.48s -> 17911.36s]  All of them.
[17911.36s -> 17913.88s]  Just different versions.
[17924.75s -> 17925.95s]  30, 3, 40.
[17926.59s -> 17927.47s]  Best throw.
[17927.47s -> 17927.97s]  Cool.
[17928.67s -> 17938.27s]  We should just end this with Skate 3.
[17938.83s -> 17941.07s]  I'm not going to play Skate 3.
[17941.07s -> 17942.19s]  What are you talking about?
[17943.55s -> 17946.03s]  I don't have an Xbox here.
[17946.99s -> 17948.03s]  A Skate 3.
[17948.75s -> 17952.41s]  How do I go up?
[17953.21s -> 17955.00s]  I don't think I can.
[17961.85s -> 17962.41s]  What did I say?
[17962.41s -> 17963.05s]  30 seconds?
[17964.35s -> 17965.07s]  How long has it been?
[17966.04s -> 17966.54s]  20?
[17967.08s -> 17969.72s]  Spam this chip to help...
[17970.44s -> 17970.94s]  What?
[17971.32s -> 17973.79s]  What the hell is that?
[17974.43s -> 17984.16s]  It's a PS3 version.
[17984.16s -> 17984.66s]  I don't...
[18002.01s -> 18003.05s]  What the fuck was this called?
[18009.21s -> 18010.73s]  Volcanic blocks.
[18010.73s -> 18013.21s]  And right above that, flowers in bloom.
[18014.17s -> 18014.67s]  Check it out.
[18017.05s -> 18018.49s]  What is this spam here?
[18018.49s -> 18019.13s]  What does that mean?
[18019.77s -> 18029.61s]  Someone want to enlighten me here?
[18033.55s -> 18035.39s]  He said yesterday this would take 30 minutes.
[18035.39s -> 18036.99s]  Can you imagine if I had kept going yesterday?
[18037.95s -> 18041.48s]  If I had continued to play?
[18057.53s -> 18059.13s]  Because that was seven and a half hours.
[18060.16s -> 18061.60s]  So you're talking seven and a half.
[18065.74s -> 18066.46s]  Yeah, that would have been...
[18067.90s -> 18069.58s]  That would have been like a 13...
[18069.58s -> 18070.86s]  Almost 13 to 14 hours.
[18070.86s -> 18073.10s]  It's like going on essentially because it's been five, right?
[18074.97s -> 18075.47s]  12?
[18076.01s -> 18079.36s]  Flowers in bloom.
[18080.08s -> 18081.79s]  Let's check this one out.
[18082.43s -> 18088.28s]  Hello, sweetheart.
[18088.28s -> 18089.48s]  I want a trip to Paris.
[18089.48s -> 18090.20s]  Imagine that.
[18090.92s -> 18092.04s]  Are you going there alone?
[18094.14s -> 18095.58s]  Yes, it's a trip for one.
[18096.52s -> 18097.64s]  But what about me?
[18099.26s -> 18101.42s]  But honey, it's only for one month.
[18102.51s -> 18103.71s]  No, I miss you too much.
[18103.71s -> 18106.03s]  But I can't pass up this opportunity.
[18106.03s -> 18107.15s]  I won't let you go.
[18107.15s -> 18108.03s]  But honey, please.
[18109.60s -> 18110.72s]  No, you can't go alone.
[18110.72s -> 18111.12s]  I will.
[18111.12s -> 18112.24s]  I don't need your permission.
[18112.24s -> 18113.44s]  What the fuck is happening?
[18117.10s -> 18117.60s]  I...
[18120.27s -> 18121.39s]  I reacted horribly.
[18121.39s -> 18123.07s]  I need to do something special.
[18123.07s -> 18124.59s]  I could decorate her house with flowers.
[18124.59s -> 18125.63s]  I have time to arrange everything.
[18125.63s -> 18127.23s]  Before she returns, I even...
[18127.23s -> 18128.19s]  Why would you put them...
[18135.66s -> 18138.94s]  You have a month to trash her house and ruin it
[18138.94s -> 18140.78s]  and put flowers all in places they're not...
[18141.66s -> 18142.54s]  What wonderful weather.
[18142.54s -> 18143.98s]  This day seems ready-made for work.
[18147.93s -> 18151.93s]  What's that sequence in the beginning?
[18161.05s -> 18162.33s]  Oh, who cares?
[18164.28s -> 18165.64s]  The image of the house...
[18167.63s -> 18168.11s]  It's like...
[18169.15s -> 18170.75s]  It's not a gingerbread house.
[18172.86s -> 18174.30s]  That's how it was being treated.
[18181.58s -> 18182.62s]  You have a month.
[18182.62s -> 18185.18s]  You're going to spend a month fucking up somebody's house?
[18185.90s -> 18188.35s]  She's going to come back and be like,
[18188.35s -> 18188.85s]  Um...
[18189.55s -> 18191.26s]  Can you...
[18191.26s -> 18192.76s]  Can you do leave?
[18193.48s -> 18199.93s]  I got to...
[18199.93s -> 18200.33s]  Hold on.
[18200.33s -> 18201.45s]  I got to complete level one.
[18201.45s -> 18202.73s]  I got to see if there's some more lore.
[18203.37s -> 18206.27s]  Because that was just a tease of lore.
[18208.96s -> 18209.92s]  Is there anything else?
[18210.48s -> 18221.79s]  Do I get to decorate the house?
[18222.43s -> 18223.56s]  That's important to know.
[18224.20s -> 18235.64s]  I'm making good progress.
[18236.20s -> 18237.40s]  If I keep doing this well,
[18237.40s -> 18240.04s]  everything will be ready for my girlfriend's return.
[18240.04s -> 18244.76s]  Click on the highlighted plant to decorate the place you'd like to most.
[18245.72s -> 18255.45s]  I ordered these plants from the botanical garden for my girlfriend.
[18255.45s -> 18257.21s]  No one in the city will have more flowers.
[18258.17s -> 18262.08s]  Honey, why the fuck did you put them on the roof?
[18266.64s -> 18267.04s]  That's it.
[18267.60s -> 18269.04s]  I don't even want to see it.
[18269.04s -> 18269.92s]  I just needed to know.
[18270.56s -> 18275.77s]  That was called Flowers and Bloom.
[18277.24s -> 18280.76s]  And right next to that is Deep Sea Marble Pup.
[18282.62s -> 18284.14s]  But what happens next?
[18284.14s -> 18307.88s]  Can you go more than that, Cameraman?
[18307.88s -> 18314.30s]  Screen is fucked always.
[18314.30s -> 18315.58s]  Screen is fucked every time.
[18317.60s -> 18321.28s]  Each one of these is a separate game that opens in a separate window
[18321.28s -> 18323.52s]  that opens its own separate game options.
[18324.70s -> 18327.10s]  And there are 700,000 of them.
[18327.10s -> 18333.48s]  Fuck hints.
[18333.48s -> 18333.88s]  Let's go.
[18335.16s -> 18336.59s]  Classic.
[18338.83s -> 18341.63s]  That's the most roundabout way to get from here to there.
[18341.63s -> 18343.15s]  I don't even know where we start.
[18344.11s -> 18344.67s]  Where's the end?
[18345.47s -> 18347.37s]  Is this the start?
[18347.37s -> 18348.73s]  So, okay.
[18352.06s -> 18352.70s]  Zuma?
[18352.70s -> 18353.26s]  Yes, it is.
[18353.26s -> 18353.66s]  I told you.
[18355.36s -> 18356.24s]  Yeah, it's Zuma.
[18356.88s -> 18359.04s]  The fish just died.
[18381.39s -> 18384.06s]  What else we got?
[18384.06s -> 18385.74s]  Power pipes are right here.
[18402.54s -> 18406.30s]  Yes, I'd like to use my GTX 1080 video sync.
[18406.30s -> 18408.46s]  I don't even know what the fuck is going to happen when I press play.
[18416.91s -> 18418.67s]  GTX 1080 leaked.
[18431.47s -> 18432.43s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[18432.43s -> 18433.79s]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[18433.87s -> 18436.43s]  We need to, I gotta back.
[18437.39s -> 18438.19s]  This is important.
[18438.99s -> 18445.76s]  We need to turn the music down.
[18445.76s -> 18446.56s]  I want to hear this guy.
[18446.56s -> 18447.28s]  Everything he says.
[18448.00s -> 18453.23s]  I gotta drag this down a little bit.
[18453.23s -> 18454.83s]  You let me know when it's in a good spot.
[18454.83s -> 18461.12s]  It's gotta be bigger.
[18464.62s -> 18466.86s]  Bigger and a little bit to the top right.
[18466.86s -> 18470.44s]  So, I'd say like that much bigger and then like up there.
[18471.00s -> 18471.72s]  Let's give that a go.
[18476.44s -> 18477.32s]  Not even fucking close.
[18477.32s -> 18481.04s]  Come down.
[18488.88s -> 18498.27s]  I mean, that's, we can fix it one more time.
[18499.07s -> 18507.56s]  This should be good.
[18508.92s -> 18509.24s]  Got it.
[18509.24s -> 18509.56s]  Perfect.
[18509.56s -> 18510.20s]  Okay.
[18510.20s -> 18512.99s]  I don't know what color off.
[18518.28s -> 18520.20s]  That's cursor.
[18520.20s -> 18521.64s]  It's not color on and off.
[18525.53s -> 18526.49s]  All right, let's, let's go.
[18528.73s -> 18529.13s]  Action.
[18529.13s -> 18529.85s]  Time trial.
[18529.85s -> 18530.97s]  Action.
[18530.97s -> 18534.19s]  It's just like a game.
[18534.19s -> 18536.11s]  Okay, buddy.
[18536.11s -> 18537.07s]  Listen up.
[18537.07s -> 18538.83s]  We have only two batteries.
[18538.83s -> 18543.15s]  You have to charge up the left one while the right battery feed the city.
[18543.15s -> 18546.99s]  To do this, connect both sides of the playing field by wires.
[18547.63s -> 18551.31s]  Then I'll swap the batteries, but be careful.
[18551.31s -> 18555.39s]  If the clips fill up the playing field, oh, you will lose.
[18586.81s -> 18592.94s]  Incoming air ball, air ball two.
[18592.94s -> 18593.98s]  Sorry, air ball two.
[18598.12s -> 18636.78s]  All right, this is called air ball two.
[18637.58s -> 18638.14s]  I'm ready.
[18638.14s -> 18638.54s]  New game.
[18639.58s -> 18640.06s]  This one.
[18640.62s -> 18641.79s]  We already played this one.
[18641.79s -> 18643.39s]  It's just another version of the same exact game.
[18643.79s -> 18645.15s]  No, it is the same game, isn't it?
[18645.95s -> 18650.28s]  Is there a difference?
[18652.60s -> 18653.40s]  Size minus.
[18654.20s -> 18658.81s]  If I can get it up there, that'd be actually pretty awesome.
[18660.75s -> 18661.79s]  Let me try to get it in the corner.
[18662.59s -> 18671.58s]  You know, you sneak it up there.
[18672.22s -> 18672.94s]  Get it stuck.
[18673.82s -> 18677.92s]  Get it stuck in there.
[18677.92s -> 18678.40s]  Come on.
[18678.40s -> 18679.60s]  Get in there and get stuck.
[18680.48s -> 18693.42s]  Noise.
[18693.42s -> 18703.24s]  Get stuck.
[18703.24s -> 18712.17s]  Get stuck.
[18712.17s -> 18712.97s]  Rare loot.
[18714.30s -> 18715.26s]  That was so distracting.
[18715.26s -> 18716.38s]  It just made me almost lose.
[18717.26s -> 18717.90s]  Give me the bonus.
[18719.26s -> 18719.66s]  Rocket.
[18720.94s -> 18727.84s]  Holy shit, look at all that loot.
[18728.64s -> 18732.30s]  Magnet.
[18733.50s -> 18734.06s]  Power ball.
[18747.88s -> 18748.68s]  Extra score.
[18749.56s -> 18754.33s]  All right, I'm going to try to do this with my eyes closed.
[18755.13s -> 18755.93s]  Ready?
[18755.93s -> 18768.75s]  I got it.
[18768.75s -> 18778.72s]  Let me try to do it with my eyes closed again.
[18778.72s -> 18784.51s]  You guys don't believe me?
[18784.51s -> 18784.75s]  Fine.
[18785.47s -> 18786.89s]  No, that's not going to work.
[18788.88s -> 18789.20s]  Ready?
[18793.10s -> 18796.22s]  You have to, I have to prove that I do it.
[18796.22s -> 18797.79s]  So here we go.
[18797.79s -> 18798.11s]  Ready?
[18798.91s -> 18820.60s]  I got it.
[18820.60s -> 18822.36s]  I wasn't peeking.
[18822.36s -> 18823.24s]  I was not peeking.
[18824.04s -> 18830.06s]  Do it with no hands.
[18831.92s -> 18836.56s]  You can't even see the game.
[18852.84s -> 18869.04s]  100 levels.
[18869.04s -> 18873.72s]  We're in the final 10, aren't we?
[18873.72s -> 18876.33s]  Break ball time travel.
[18876.33s -> 18876.97s]  Let's see it.
[18876.97s -> 18878.01s]  Rapid fire.
[18878.01s -> 18885.29s]  Not going to open?
[18887.32s -> 18891.61s]  Break ball time travel also does not open.
[18891.61s -> 18902.83s]  So what do we got left?
[18905.45s -> 18906.09s]  Arc pinball.
[18906.09s -> 18910.62s]  Wait, we already did arca pinball, didn't we?
[18910.62s -> 18912.62s]  Arca pinball neo worlds.
[18912.62s -> 18913.18s]  No, we didn't.
[18913.18s -> 18914.46s]  This one looks terrifying.
[18925.71s -> 18926.43s]  It's another one.
[18926.43s -> 18927.23s]  It's the same thing.
[18927.95s -> 18933.31s]  It's the same exact thing that we just did.
[18935.07s -> 18944.00s]  This looks like Stardew Valley.
[18944.64s -> 18947.68s]  I can assure you it's not going to be like Stardew Valley.
[18958.96s -> 18961.68s]  If it is the same thing, it's instantly getting X'd.
[18961.68s -> 18978.24s]  Oh wait, it looks like it's the same.
[18978.24s -> 18979.84s]  How is this pinball?
[18979.84s -> 19004.22s]  It's a unique take on the breakout genre.
[19004.22s -> 19008.41s]  But who wants a, who wants a breakout game?
[19012.43s -> 19017.07s]  Is it just because they can make 500 randomly generated levels
[19017.07s -> 19019.07s]  and say it's 500 different video games?
[19023.28s -> 19027.69s]  I can't think of any person that wants this.
[19028.80s -> 19029.76s]  Not even old people.
[19029.76s -> 19030.80s]  Old people don't play these.
[19031.68s -> 19034.48s]  Your grandmother doesn't give a shit about this kind of game.
[19035.12s -> 19036.16s]  It's too hard for her.
[19052.81s -> 19054.17s]  Little breakdown.
[19056.92s -> 19058.28s]  Where was that?
[19058.28s -> 19060.28s]  Grandma pinball.
[19060.28s -> 19072.41s]  Is this one?
[19072.41s -> 19074.49s]  We've got Chinese chess.
[19075.05s -> 19077.13s]  I have no idea how to play this.
[19077.13s -> 19078.89s]  I don't have, I have no idea.
[19078.89s -> 19085.60s]  I don't know what any of this means.
[19086.24s -> 19107.58s]  Is it the pawns or can my cannon shoot his cannon?
[19108.22s -> 19131.92s]  Is there like a kill button?
[19131.92s -> 19134.32s]  What's the, what's the kill button?
[19134.32s -> 19173.10s]  Well, we both lost because green.
[19174.24s -> 19178.25s]  That is green.
[19178.25s -> 19182.60s]  It looks like black.
[19182.60s -> 19183.40s]  GG.
[19183.40s -> 19184.12s]  Idiot.
[19184.12s -> 19194.28s]  This whole side is almost done.
[19194.28s -> 19199.16s]  We just have fairy flower vines and vogue tails.
[19199.16s -> 19206.91s]  Fairy flower vines.
[19206.91s -> 19213.79s]  What the fuck?
[19215.21s -> 19217.85s]  You were holding the controller upside down.
[19217.85s -> 19219.13s]  I hope that was on the screen.
[19237.82s -> 19241.34s]  Match three or Zuma related.
[19241.34s -> 19248.16s]  What do you think?
[19248.16s -> 19252.24s]  Enclosed by mysterious mist, the magic flower land exists.
[19253.04s -> 19257.36s]  Above the ridge there's Lumendor, the famous castle made to soar.
[19258.88s -> 19266.14s]  One day an old prediction said, a day of whitening mignonette.
[19267.02s -> 19269.74s]  An elven girl will come to land in water,
[19269.74s -> 19273.18s]  Lily's leaf shall learn the magic of wildlife,
[19273.18s -> 19275.42s]  will solve new quests like playing the thief.
[19276.22s -> 19279.90s]  The mist will cover the earth no more and she will enter Lumendor.
[19280.54s -> 19284.70s]  And she was born and here she is and here's her fairy mentor Liz.
[19288.56s -> 19289.44s]  What the fuck?
[19292.54s -> 19294.70s]  Yeah, yeah, it's the pipe game again.
[19319.60s -> 19332.20s]  I'm going to turn the camera on because this is exactly the position I've been in for like
[19332.20s -> 19333.00s]  the last two minutes.
[19351.47s -> 19352.03s]  Fuck.
[19352.03s -> 19352.83s]  Oh, fuck.
[19353.79s -> 19354.75s]  Holy fuck.
[19368.92s -> 19370.12s]  Vogue tails.
[19370.12s -> 19377.87s]  Come on, vogue tails.
[19377.87s -> 19378.19s]  Let's go.
[19378.99s -> 19380.92s]  I don't know God all day.
[19380.92s -> 19402.73s]  Yeah, 3D mode is fine.
[19408.40s -> 19411.20s]  I just jump scared myself with my own face because it minimized.
[19412.08s -> 19425.44s]  Too much, too much, too much, too much.
[19425.44s -> 19426.00s]  There we go.
[19426.00s -> 19427.44s]  That looks fine.
[19427.44s -> 19429.36s]  Yeah, yeah.
[19433.58s -> 19434.78s]  I thought that just said Hillary.
[19434.78s -> 19435.66s]  No, hi Gary.
[19435.66s -> 19436.30s]  Okay, play.
[19439.02s -> 19440.22s]  Somewhere in the suburbs.
[19440.94s -> 19442.70s]  I wonder who else remembered.
[19443.42s -> 19446.14s]  One more present from grandma.
[19446.14s -> 19448.62s]  Top priority, open on 18th birthday.
[19449.58s -> 19452.86s]  She promised to give me her mastery secrets.
[19452.86s -> 19454.38s]  Oh well, I'll wait till the morning.
[19458.11s -> 19462.24s]  That night, the dummies woke up from an unusual noise.
[19462.24s -> 19463.04s]  The dummies?
[19464.20s -> 19465.80s]  Holy moly, a robbery.
[19467.68s -> 19468.88s]  Give it back.
[19471.37s -> 19472.81s]  Oh my, the secrets.
[19472.81s -> 19473.21s]  Wrong.
[19474.01s -> 19476.41s]  They went to London after them.
[19476.41s -> 19478.33s]  But where are we going to get money for tickets?
[19478.89s -> 19479.37s]  Wendy.
[19482.83s -> 19484.51s]  Was the guy running out of the house going like,
[19484.51s -> 19486.91s]  I'll see you in London, you pieces of shit.
[19487.71s -> 19490.97s]  How would they know that?
[19491.53s -> 19503.87s]  Well, now I'm completely broken and the tickets are expensive.
[19503.87s -> 19504.35s]  To work.
[19506.89s -> 19507.13s]  What?
[19507.85s -> 19509.93s]  Let's learn to make clothes.
[19509.93s -> 19511.77s]  Take a pattern sketch from the table.
[19512.41s -> 19515.28s]  And it's one of these walk back and forth,
[19515.28s -> 19516.64s]  diner dash fucking games.
[19517.36s -> 19526.24s]  Please wait while the sleeves are being steamed.
[19527.04s -> 19536.33s]  You want a green dress.
[19540.64s -> 19541.52s]  Look at the magazine.
[19541.52s -> 19543.04s]  Who is on this magazine?
[19543.92s -> 19546.16s]  Did she just eat it?
[19546.88s -> 19553.00s]  She's eating these clothes.
[19553.72s -> 19555.39s]  Excellent.
[19555.39s -> 19556.19s]  You have your first sale.
[19556.19s -> 19557.23s]  Click on the money to take it.
[19557.23s -> 19558.43s]  If you complete the orders quickly,
[19558.43s -> 19560.03s]  just like now, you'll get a tip.
[19561.15s -> 19562.43s]  $27 tip.
[19563.07s -> 19566.67s]  Throw it out the window.
[19567.47s -> 19568.59s]  You threw the dress in the trash.
[19568.59s -> 19569.63s]  You couldn't just put that on sale.
[19569.63s -> 19570.35s]  Somebody would have bought it.
[19574.80s -> 19575.44s]  Open the store.
[19577.08s -> 19578.20s]  Green dress.
[19578.20s -> 19581.42s]  What a waste of materials.
[19582.14s -> 19585.69s]  And a blue coat.
[19586.65s -> 19594.76s]  That's closer to the uh-oh one that I was talking about before.
[19595.64s -> 19600.94s]  Same lady, you're back.
[19602.30s -> 19606.70s]  Could I have another one of those green dresses again, dear?
[19609.93s -> 19610.41s]  Steam it.
[19618.38s -> 19653.24s]  Oh, marvelous.
[19653.24s -> 19654.04s]  That was...
[19655.23s -> 19655.79s]  It was.
[19656.51s -> 19658.01s]  I don't remember.
[19658.01s -> 19658.57s]  What was it called?
[19660.94s -> 19662.38s]  Oh, Vogue Tail.
[19664.97s -> 19667.13s]  Oh, we are down to the last...
[19668.89s -> 19669.45s]  Where are we?
[19669.45s -> 19671.85s]  We've got Astro Color Twist.
[19675.44s -> 19675.68s]  And...
[19676.83s -> 19677.23s]  Okay.
[19679.37s -> 19680.81s]  Astro Color Twists.
[19681.53s -> 19686.91s]  Oh, there's also one more.
[19686.91s -> 19687.31s]  There's...
[19687.31s -> 19687.79s]  What is it?
[19688.35s -> 19689.24s]  Something...
[19689.24s -> 19690.20s]  I can't even read what it says.
[19690.76s -> 19691.92s]  Let's see.
[19691.92s -> 19692.24s]  Okay.
[19692.24s -> 19693.12s]  Oh, that one right now.
[19696.17s -> 19698.17s]  That is Lovely Kitchen.
[19698.17s -> 19699.60s]  Let's do Lovely Kitchen.
[19700.16s -> 19715.72s]  Powered by TGV Blam Games and Selectsoft.
[19717.74s -> 19731.50s]  Free recorded stream.
[19732.14s -> 19734.88s]  Ah, it's not.
[19734.88s -> 19740.65s]  Nah, it ain't.
[19740.65s -> 19741.37s]  All right.
[19741.37s -> 19742.17s]  Hello.
[19742.17s -> 19743.21s]  Simulation mode.
[19743.21s -> 19743.93s]  Casual...
[19743.93s -> 19744.89s]  This is...
[19744.89s -> 19746.73s]  This is Diner Dash.
[19746.73s -> 19747.69s]  Yes, it is.
[19747.69s -> 19752.04s]  It's just Diner Dash again.
[19752.04s -> 19753.80s]  But just called something else.
[19754.84s -> 19756.88s]  Hi, my name is Mary.
[19759.66s -> 19762.30s]  I'll tell you an exciting story about myself.
[19762.30s -> 19765.34s]  When I was a child, I dreamed about opening my own restaurant.
[19765.34s -> 19766.94s]  I wanted to become a famous cook.
[19767.58s -> 19771.02s]  I played for hours imagining I'd make tasty dishes in my restaurant.
[19771.42s -> 19772.86s]  And give them to my friends and relatives.
[19772.86s -> 19775.74s]  You would feed your friends sand cakes.
[19775.74s -> 19777.02s]  And you made them have indigestion.
[19777.02s -> 19779.58s]  And you caused them a lot of fucking digestive problems.
[19779.58s -> 19781.58s]  Thanks to my mom, I mastered the basics of cooking.
[19783.31s -> 19784.11s]  It's more sand.
[19784.75s -> 19786.35s]  That's all we eat here, is sand.
[19788.16s -> 19791.28s]  I've grown up and entered the culinary academy for a restaurateur.
[19791.84s -> 19792.88s]  There's sand under there.
[19794.48s -> 19797.52s]  After graduating the academy, I decided to make my dream come true.
[19797.52s -> 19799.28s]  So I started to look for suitable premises.
[19799.28s -> 19809.90s]  I love this image so much.
[19811.26s -> 19812.38s]  My dream has come true.
[19812.94s -> 19816.01s]  Hello, opening.
[19816.01s -> 19816.81s]  Now we finally met.
[19816.81s -> 19817.53s]  My name is Mary.
[19817.53s -> 19818.49s]  This is our first working day.
[19818.49s -> 19819.93s]  Our clients are waiting for the restaurant.
[19819.93s -> 19820.57s]  Good luck.
[19822.01s -> 19823.13s]  Don't start the tutorial.
[19824.17s -> 19826.03s]  I know what to do.
[19829.28s -> 19831.28s]  Wiping your brow with sweat and you're gonna touch food.
[19846.97s -> 19849.77s]  Do you and your four twins care if you sit together?
[19850.49s -> 19855.20s]  Did everybody want cupcakes?
[19856.00s -> 19873.72s]  All right, I got two cupcakes.
[19873.72s -> 19874.22s]  You.
[19876.11s -> 19876.61s]  Coffee.
[19878.00s -> 19879.44s]  And you want, what is that?
[19880.64s -> 19881.70s]  Tomatoes?
[19882.66s -> 19884.21s]  What are you, what is that?
[19884.85s -> 19890.03s]  I don't know what that item is.
[19890.03s -> 19890.51s]  It's not here.
[19892.51s -> 19894.27s]  Just, well, it's just baloney.
[19894.27s -> 19895.23s]  He just wants baloney.
[19901.26s -> 19902.06s]  Give me some baloney.
[19905.92s -> 19908.72s]  Microwaving and your dream restaurant.
[19909.28s -> 19911.60s]  You gotta be fucking kidding me, mate.
[19914.69s -> 19916.69s]  You just opened the fucking place.
[19917.41s -> 19920.45s]  And you're already microwaving frozen fucking food.
[19921.25s -> 19922.05s]  Oh my God.
[19922.85s -> 19924.80s]  I can't even put this shit down.
[19924.80s -> 19925.92s]  How do I put this in the trash?
[19926.88s -> 19929.86s]  But I mean, that's absolutely fucking, that's a disgrace.
[19931.14s -> 19934.91s]  Microwave.
[19935.63s -> 19942.83s]  Where's my fucking microwave baloney?
[19942.83s -> 19943.79s]  This is bullshit.
[19947.65s -> 19951.73s]  I want four slices of baloney on a piece of white bread.
[19952.45s -> 19954.53s]  And I am living that I don't have it.
[19955.25s -> 19961.98s]  I'm gonna give your restaurant two stars.
[19962.70s -> 19964.53s]  I don't know how to, I can't do this.
[19965.33s -> 19966.45s]  I fucked it all up.
[19966.45s -> 19967.25s]  Can I leave?
[19967.25s -> 19968.29s]  Can I close?
[19968.29s -> 19969.33s]  That's it, I'm outta here.
[19969.89s -> 19970.93s]  Can I just, can I deck him?
[19971.49s -> 19991.62s]  Holiday Rush.
[19991.62s -> 19993.17s]  Sounds fun.
[19993.17s -> 19996.16s]  Let's give it a try.
[20001.20s -> 20002.88s]  Rule of thumb, these games are right next to each other,
[20002.88s -> 20006.30s]  which means it's gonna be a reskin of that game.
[20006.30s -> 20007.18s]  But Christmas time.
[20015.60s -> 20016.88s]  Maginmon?
[20016.88s -> 20017.76s]  Maginmons.
[20018.48s -> 20019.42s]  Yeah, I see it.
[20020.06s -> 20021.22s]  What am I gonna do?
[20021.22s -> 20022.10s]  You think I'm just gonna skip it?
[20022.66s -> 20048.98s]  Holiday Rush.
[20048.98s -> 20050.66s]  Career or survival?
[20051.78s -> 20052.58s]  Survival.
[20058.83s -> 20059.79s]  I don't get it.
[20059.79s -> 20061.07s]  How do you survive that?
[20061.87s -> 20074.40s]  Please select starting episode.
[20074.40s -> 20075.20s]  Episode one.
[20076.24s -> 20076.80s]  Start game.
[20077.44s -> 20082.38s]  Another job search.
[20083.26s -> 20085.82s]  Looking for waiter, looking for janitor, looking for salesman.
[20086.70s -> 20088.30s]  It's time to start my own business.
[20089.66s -> 20092.24s]  Something that would be profitable and also make people happy.
[20092.24s -> 20093.04s]  What it could be.
[20094.08s -> 20094.64s]  That's enough.
[20095.20s -> 20096.64s]  Tired of working for somebody else.
[20097.28s -> 20098.96s]  These people need a good vacation.
[20101.12s -> 20102.24s]  Oh, a travel agency.
[20103.04s -> 20104.40s]  No sooner said than done.
[20104.40s -> 20105.36s]  Here's my office.
[20106.16s -> 20109.02s]  Well, it's nothing special, but you have to start somewhere.
[20109.02s -> 20110.94s]  Now everyone start working.
[20110.94s -> 20112.38s]  Don't keep the customers waiting.
[20113.10s -> 20117.58s]  Hold on.
[20117.58s -> 20122.88s]  So Guy, Guy is actively talking about how he's
[20123.76s -> 20125.68s]  looking for a salesman, waiter.
[20125.68s -> 20127.12s]  Like, I don't want to work for somebody else.
[20127.12s -> 20129.36s]  And like, I want to make somebody fucking happy.
[20130.00s -> 20131.36s]  How could I make somebody happy?
[20131.36s -> 20133.92s]  And not be like a shitty boss, work for someone else.
[20134.96s -> 20137.28s]  Get to fucking work and don't keep people waiting.
[20139.14s -> 20140.50s]  You flipped real quickly, man.
[20140.50s -> 20142.50s]  You went through the evil villain arc.
[20143.38s -> 20145.06s]  It's less than fucking one panel.
[20145.86s -> 20150.93s]  Welcome to the travel agency.
[20150.93s -> 20153.90s]  It's time to learn the basics of the tourist business.
[20153.90s -> 20156.06s]  Get ready to help our first customers.
[20156.06s -> 20159.62s]  First.
[20166.66s -> 20167.16s]  Okay.
[20168.42s -> 20169.70s]  This is your first customer.
[20169.70s -> 20171.70s]  Click on her to find out what kind of vacation she wants.
[20172.42s -> 20175.31s]  Please wait while she considers her choices.
[20176.67s -> 20179.68s]  It's a very odd place.
[20179.68s -> 20180.80s]  She wants a resort tour.
[20180.80s -> 20183.28s]  Now take the blank paper sheet from the stand.
[20185.55s -> 20188.59s]  And give it to a worker responsible for resort tours.
[20189.47s -> 20192.51s]  Wait until she completes her work while you stand there.
[20192.51s -> 20193.55s]  She's just angry.
[20193.55s -> 20195.47s]  Look at how fucking mad they are already.
[20198.58s -> 20200.42s]  This is a hellish work environment, apparently.
[20200.42s -> 20201.22s]  What the fuck was that?
[20201.94s -> 20209.87s]  After receiving his order, now take the customer's order.
[20210.43s -> 20213.55s]  If you pick up the incorrect item, you can dump it into a trash can.
[20214.51s -> 20224.06s]  What did I do wrong?
[20233.87s -> 20234.91s]  Oh, the paper, right.
[20235.79s -> 20277.50s]  It's for $420.
[20277.50s -> 20279.82s]  Excellent work at Cheaty Legs, this is guaranteed.
[20283.06s -> 20284.74s]  New service discount tours.
[20284.74s -> 20285.78s]  And it's just another desk.
[20287.10s -> 20288.54s]  My whole computer just locked up.
[20288.54s -> 20289.42s]  Hopefully we're still live.
[20290.30s -> 20295.27s]  We are.
[20297.01s -> 20297.51s]  Okay, good.
[20299.78s -> 20300.82s]  That was holiday rush.
[20301.38s -> 20306.88s]  I don't know why that's not called travel rush or agency rush.
[20306.88s -> 20308.00s]  Why holiday?
[20308.00s -> 20309.92s]  Well, holiday is English.
[20309.92s -> 20312.88s]  It's a European term for going on vacation, right?
[20313.44s -> 20314.96s]  I thought it was going to be like Christmas presents.
[20318.53s -> 20319.09s]  All right.
[20319.17s -> 20324.00s]  That leaves us with only one or two that remain.
[20330.86s -> 20331.98s]  Astro color twist.
[20332.78s -> 20334.46s]  But that's all, hold on a minute here.
[20334.46s -> 20335.66s]  That's also, that's part of this.
[20336.38s -> 20340.08s]  So we have magic, magic mons.
[20342.51s -> 20343.07s]  Here we go.
[20343.07s -> 20344.27s]  Everyone's been waiting for this one.
[20352.96s -> 20355.28s]  People have actually been waiting for this one.
[20382.03s -> 20389.39s]  Doesn't open.
[20389.39s -> 20392.35s]  Hold on, let me try a different tactic.
[20392.35s -> 20394.83s]  Let me try, let me see if I can do what I can in the folder.
[20395.71s -> 20397.07s]  Every time we try to do this, it doesn't work.
[20397.07s -> 20400.83s]  But maybe the one time for the last one here, it might work.
[20401.63s -> 20402.85s]  I'm willing to give it a shot.
[20403.57s -> 20410.38s]  There it is.
[20411.02s -> 20414.83s]  Let's make sure we got this in full compatibility mode.
[20416.91s -> 20418.35s]  Administrator, it's on.
[20422.21s -> 20424.08s]  We've done this before.
[20424.08s -> 20425.36s]  Let's see, is it going to work?
[20436.11s -> 20441.10s]  Sorry, let me hold and change.
[20441.10s -> 20442.54s]  Maybe let me change one thing.
[20442.54s -> 20443.02s]  Hold on.
[20443.66s -> 20452.14s]  What about disable full screen optimizations and reduce color mode?
[20453.17s -> 20455.17s]  And actually, I don't want to do that.
[20455.17s -> 20456.18s]  Let's try this.
[20458.16s -> 20467.42s]  Not going to happen.
[20474.08s -> 20475.28s]  I was waiting for so long.
[20476.32s -> 20482.96s]  And just like that, all of the actual video games have been opened or lack thereof.
[20485.33s -> 20486.37s]  Did the fire crash?
[20486.93s -> 20492.16s]  The fire crashed.
[20492.72s -> 20496.10s]  It's not even running.
[20496.10s -> 20502.98s]  What a journey.
[20502.98s -> 20504.66s]  Thanks everybody for joining me on that journey.
[20504.66s -> 20505.94s]  Now we have a few more to open.
[20506.98s -> 20510.82s]  This one, by the way, is going to be rapid fire crystal caverns.
[20511.62s -> 20518.46s]  Crystal caverns of Amon Ra.
[20522.32s -> 20524.16s]  Astro color twist is on this list.
[20525.81s -> 20526.77s]  Don't worry, don't worry.
[20529.84s -> 20530.64s]  Oh, look it.
[20530.64s -> 20531.44s]  It's Zuma.
[20532.72s -> 20533.52s]  Can you believe it?
[20536.05s -> 20536.55s]  Wow.
[20537.65s -> 20539.09s]  I'm glad we opened this one.
[20540.53s -> 20541.03s]  Glad.
[20541.73s -> 20542.61s]  Very glad.
[20542.61s -> 20543.89s]  Very, very glad.
[20543.89s -> 20544.77s]  Let's start.
[20547.89s -> 20548.69s]  Enter your name.
[20549.73s -> 20550.23s]  Dick.
[20551.17s -> 20555.54s]  Okay, Zuma, Zuma, Zuma.
[20556.18s -> 20587.63s]  But this one, can I please just put the X on that one?
[20588.77s -> 20589.73s]  It's the same one.
[20590.29s -> 20591.81s]  It even shows the balls.
[20591.81s -> 20593.65s]  It shows the balls flying down.
[20593.65s -> 20595.47s]  It's the same one.
[20595.47s -> 20596.91s]  You're not going to let me skip this one.
[20597.55s -> 20599.55s]  I really have to click dynasty of Egypt.
[20606.62s -> 20609.74s]  This line of the next three or four are all Zuma's.
[20614.34s -> 20616.10s]  It's actually the same thing.
[20616.10s -> 20617.14s]  Look, start.
[20617.14s -> 20618.74s]  I wonder what's going to happen when I press start.
[20619.78s -> 20620.66s]  Oh, enter your name.
[20622.72s -> 20623.60s]  Saint Font.
[20624.56s -> 20625.76s]  Yeah, yup, yup.
[20625.76s -> 20627.20s]  Oh, this one's a little different though.
[20627.20s -> 20628.00s]  This one.
[20628.00s -> 20628.48s]  Take a look.
[20637.68s -> 20640.16s]  Buy Maginmon's on Amazon.
[20641.65s -> 20647.01s]  If it doesn't work in this game pack, why would it work if I bought it standalone?
[20649.49s -> 20651.17s]  Fuck, I wanted to end this before this happened.
[20651.17s -> 20651.67s]  Okay, good.
[20652.45s -> 20654.37s]  I almost just clicked on the X on OBS.
[20655.25s -> 20656.66s]  I hope you guys understand that.
[20657.86s -> 20660.42s]  I moved my mouse up to click on the X on OBS.
[20661.14s -> 20668.69s]  Just get it on the Wii.
[20670.66s -> 20671.94s]  Buy Magin...
[20671.94s -> 20673.09s]  Hold on.
[20679.07s -> 20680.11s]  Let me just look this up.
[20680.11s -> 20680.99s]  Maginmon's.
[20685.78s -> 20687.46s]  Maginmon's Electronics.
[20688.10s -> 20700.61s]  Everyone unlock the power of the Maginmon's and a faraway kingdom live the Maginmon's,
[20700.61s -> 20705.33s]  magic pets that help the good wizards keep the forces of the world in equilibrium.
[20705.33s -> 20709.81s]  But that stability is threatened when a powerful evil sorcerer captures the Maginmon's
[20709.81s -> 20711.49s]  and hides them in his dark catacombs.
[20712.05s -> 20716.05s]  Without their influence, the imbalance of magical energy could tear the whole kingdom apart.
[20716.05s -> 20719.73s]  The great council of wizards has chosen you as their companion.
[20719.73s -> 20723.01s]  Now you must travel deep in the labyrinths of the dark wizard.
[20723.01s -> 20725.57s]  Bring back the mighty Maginmon's and restore the natural balance.
[20726.93s -> 20727.89s]  Over 30 levels.
[20738.75s -> 20745.01s]  There is not one single result under videos for Maginmon's.
[20745.01s -> 20745.65s]  Not even one.
[20746.29s -> 20747.73s]  How is that possible?
[20763.57s -> 20765.09s]  No one on earth has done this.
[20765.81s -> 20768.67s]  But it's going to be a match three game.
[20770.19s -> 20771.47s]  We don't know what this is.
[20771.47s -> 20773.47s]  It's going to be match three, guys.
[20773.47s -> 20775.15s]  It's not going to be anything spectacular.
[20780.78s -> 20781.58s]  Corner the market.
[20781.58s -> 20784.22s]  Be the world's first Maginmon's streamer.
[20784.86s -> 20787.58s]  There's a free demo.
[20795.17s -> 20799.79s]  This shit's Zuma.
[20799.79s -> 20800.19s]  Look at it.
[20800.19s -> 20801.39s]  Is this Pac-Man or Zuma?
[20801.39s -> 20801.87s]  I don't want it.
[20801.87s -> 20802.43s]  Look at that.
[20802.43s -> 20803.07s]  Look at the image.
[20803.71s -> 20808.05s]  No, that's a Pac-Man like Zuma game.
[20808.05s -> 20809.33s]  I don't care.
[20809.33s -> 20817.49s]  It's just another Zuma game.
[20823.71s -> 20825.39s]  We have so many other ones to play.
[20826.59s -> 20828.43s]  Oh, jewels of the Nile.
[20828.43s -> 20831.07s]  I remember when I had the Nile River.
[20832.58s -> 20834.10s]  I remember when I went there.
[20834.74s -> 20835.54s]  I've seen it.
[20835.54s -> 20848.75s]  When I got there, as you see, there's these red, orange, and green balls.
[20849.79s -> 20870.99s]  I'm happy that I'm opening all these.
[20871.71s -> 20873.31s]  I missed it.
[20873.31s -> 20873.81s]  Fuck.
[20874.51s -> 20881.25s]  Gives the credits every time.
[20881.97s -> 20885.54s]  You might want to see a doctor.
[20885.54s -> 20886.04s]  For what?
[20886.74s -> 20887.70s]  What's wrong?
[20887.70s -> 20890.55s]  Mahjong.
[20891.79s -> 20892.75s]  Hexagon.
[20892.75s -> 20893.25s]  Mahjong.
[20893.95s -> 20897.81s]  I actually am looking forward to Super Word games.
[20897.81s -> 20898.93s]  I feel like that's going to be sick.
[20906.90s -> 20912.70s]  So here are the thousands of games here.
[20930.61s -> 20931.25s]  Seagull.
[20931.25s -> 20931.75s]  Yep.
[20974.72s -> 20975.92s]  Magic Mons are riot.
[20975.92s -> 20977.20s]  Magic Mons are riot.
[20977.84s -> 20979.86s]  It's not going to happen.
[20979.86s -> 20981.06s]  You're going to be so disappointed.
[20981.06s -> 20983.22s]  I'd rather you think it's good.
[20983.94s -> 20986.34s]  So in your mind, it'll always be good.
[20987.06s -> 20998.82s]  This is the part I'm talking about here.

[21014.08s -> 21016.74s]  Economics.
[21016.74s -> 21018.26s]  And we're going to do economics three.
[21018.26s -> 21021.90s]  What the fuck does that do?
[21021.90s -> 21026.72s]  I choose hang man.
[21026.72s -> 21027.68s]  Play click.
[21027.68s -> 21030.00s]  Play click here.
[21030.00s -> 21030.96s]  And choose mode.
[21032.08s -> 21033.04s]  Choose category.
[21033.04s -> 21034.96s]  Mode is just levels mode.
[21034.96s -> 21035.68s]  Press play.
[21035.68s -> 21036.32s]  Economics.
[21036.88s -> 21037.38s]  No.

[21044.08s -> 21046.74s]  Can't take much more of that music.
[21046.74s -> 21048.42s]  All right, so this is economics.
[21050.02s -> 21050.52s]  A.
[21051.30s -> 21052.34s]  It's got an A in there.
[21053.78s -> 21054.28s]  R.

[22328.31s -> 22362.65s]  Slippralo, Sirloin, Sirlplue, the Swirlpool, the Swirlpool,
[22362.65s -> 22370.60s]  Swirlpool, single reed instrument, I don't have any idea what a single reed
[22370.60s -> 22404.70s]  instrument is, clarinet, there's no C, tuba, got it, what else you got,
[22404.70s -> 22438.92s]  vacant, vacuum, octave, kazoo, kebab, cabal, from Mortal Kombat,
[22438.92s -> 22456.27s]  what, so this is all single reed instruments, I got us out of there,
[22456.27s -> 22461.64s]  we had to do it, chess, Sudoku, I don't know how to play Sudoku,
[22461.64s -> 22464.64s]  I have no idea, that's loud and I'm very sorry it is, no it's not,
[22464.64s -> 22467.64s]  it's already turned down, I have no idea how to do Sudoku,
[22467.64s -> 22471.64s]  not a single clue, I've never played it before, I don't fucking know,
[22471.64s -> 22477.83s]  no idea, this is probably really cool,
[22477.83s -> 22482.84s]  somebody would think this is really fun maybe, I did it, solved it,
[22482.84s -> 22492.16s]  I win, I don't know, I don't want to do that, I clicked it,
[22492.16s -> 22497.73s]  you can't say I didn't, chess, solitaire, more chess bullshit,
[22497.73s -> 22500.73s]  this one's just bigger, this one's just a bigger version,
[22500.73s -> 22512.85s]  this one's just huge, what happened, I mean I did it fucking easily,
[22512.85s -> 22524.20s]  I had soap on my hands for that one, I got like slipped on it,
[22524.20s -> 22539.23s]  chess, reversey, it's got reversey, oh my fucking god,
[22539.23s -> 22556.84s]  chess brain teasers, I wonder what it's going to be, can you guess,
[22556.84s -> 22585.03s]  the fucking balls, the balls, look at this, do you understand the balls,
[22585.03s -> 22588.20s]  let me show you some balls here, look at the balls,
[22588.20s -> 22592.76s]  just look at these balls, put your face on the screen,
[22592.76s -> 22605.81s]  100,000, 100,000, 100,000, 350,000 games on this disc
[22605.81s -> 22613.04s]  are levels in those stupid chess brain teaser games,
[22613.04s -> 22621.09s]  this is half of every game on this whole entire collection,
[22621.09s -> 22636.62s]  are chess brain teasers, the balls, now let's do mahjong, 25,000,
[22636.62s -> 22661.95s]  what the fuck does that mean, I don't know what that was,
[22661.95s -> 22669.83s]  that was, okay, that was scary current gen computer horror movie shit,
[22669.83s -> 22675.24s]  that probably happens in unfriended, I wouldn't be surprised,
[22675.24s -> 22713.20s]  chess magic 30,000, sorry it's not 350,000, it's 380,000,
[22713.20s -> 22722.83s]  380,000 games, this is 2002 games, very, very, very vague,
[22722.83s -> 22732.49s]  let's see what it is, oh my god,
[22732.49s -> 22737.49s]  I wonder how a different animal herder one is going to be
[22737.49s -> 22748.41s]  the animal herder six, this is alien ship shoot,
[22748.41s -> 22757.81s]  oh my fucking god, it opened a virus window,
[22757.81s -> 22768.26s]  what, oh, nice pop out window, no, I can't even play it like this,
[22768.26s -> 22796.44s]  what the fuck is happening, I got it,
[22796.44s -> 22819.32s]  they were making better games 30 fucking years ago,
[22819.32s -> 22836.68s]  this is uncalled for, faster, faster, faster, faster,
[22836.68s -> 22841.03s]  I got it, no I didn't,
[22841.03s -> 22846.15s]  aliens are taking over the world, game over, hold on,
[22846.15s -> 22849.15s]  use your rocket to shoot the evil alien spaceships,
[22849.15s -> 22851.15s]  hit space bar, button, I can get this,
[22851.15s -> 22855.73s]  I'm so used to how fast it was going before,
[22855.73s -> 22888.97s]  oh man, I got it, that hit box, got it,
[22888.97s -> 22902.47s]  I can't get past 22, oh, I got to get past 22,
[22902.47s -> 22907.78s]  no, get out, get out, there are, alien shoot one,
[22907.78s -> 22909.78s]  that's not even the right one, this is the correct one,
[22909.78s -> 22916.92s]  one, two, three windows, let's go, alien ship one,
[22916.92s -> 22922.53s]  the difference is that the rocket is a different image,
[22922.53s -> 22928.86s]  I bet you 100 million dollars that alien ship two
[22928.86s -> 22941.70s]  is going to have a different college ship, 21,
[22941.70s -> 22957.24s]  oh no, I don't think it's possible to go past 22,
[22957.24s -> 22973.35s]  I don't think it is, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27,
[22973.35s -> 22981.37s]  oh, it's alright, X, alien ship two,
[22981.37s -> 22992.94s]  I definitely have a virus, see, look, who cares,
[22992.94s -> 22997.25s]  just look at the thumbnails, yep, that's a different ship,
[22997.25s -> 22999.25s]  that's a different ship, that's a different ship,
[22999.25s -> 23002.25s]  that's a different ship, this is alien snipe show,
[23002.25s -> 23005.25s]  boy, this is going to be fun, no audio either on any of these,
[23005.25s -> 23010.01s]  instructions, the objective of sniper is to take down
[23010.01s -> 23012.01s]  as many armed opponents as possible,
[23012.01s -> 23015.01s]  to shoot an enemy, use the mouse to position the crosshair
[23015.01s -> 23017.01s]  over the enemy and the left mouse button to fire,
[23017.01s -> 23021.01s]  for each enemy you shoot, you will be awarded 15 points,
[23021.01s -> 23023.01s]  but watch out, the enemy shoots back,
[23023.01s -> 23025.25s]  your health meter will decrease when you're hit,
[23025.25s -> 23027.25s]  every 30 enemies killed will progress you to the next level,
[23027.25s -> 23029.25s]  but be careful every time the level progresses,
[23029.25s -> 23031.25s]  the enemies get a little bit smarter,
[23031.25s -> 23033.25s]  and the weapons get a little bit stronger,
[23033.25s -> 23035.25s]  as you play you will encounter power-ups,
[23035.25s -> 23042.04s]  health packs, and shields, I'm ready,
[23042.04s -> 23058.50s]  this such severe lag here on this mouse,
[23058.50s -> 23063.21s]  am I walking forward, you'd get an F in a game design class
[23063.21s -> 23087.06s]  if you fucking presented this, I can't do it anymore,
[23087.06s -> 23089.06s]  oh my god, I deleted everything,
[23089.06s -> 23092.06s]  sorry, we can get right back into 2002 games,
[23092.06s -> 23097.18s]  okay, the difference is they're robots,
[23097.18s -> 23099.18s]  they're a different kind of alien,
[23099.18s -> 23101.18s]  they're an animal herder one,
[23101.18s -> 23104.18s]  which one do you want to play the most,
[23104.18s -> 23107.18s]  lions, tigers, chickens and donkeys,
[23107.18s -> 23113.12s]  cats, donkeys and shih tzus,
[23113.12s -> 23117.88s]  foxes, bears and hyenas,
[23117.88s -> 23122.12s]  or gorillas, or dinosaurs, elephants,
[23122.12s -> 23125.12s]  and birds, I guess this one,
[23125.12s -> 23137.53s]  move your cursor to herd the animals into their correct pen,
[23137.53s -> 23139.53s]  your cursor will repel the animals,
[23139.53s -> 23141.53s]  so you have to maneuver them from behind,
[23141.53s -> 23143.53s]  if all animals are correctly navigated,
[23143.53s -> 23145.53s]  okay, I think I get it,
[23145.53s -> 23153.40s]  the first sound, Jesus Christ,
[23153.40s -> 23155.40s]  what was that noise,
[23155.40s -> 23162.23s]  what the fuck is that noise,
[23162.23s -> 23165.62s]  oh god, they're falling,
[23165.62s -> 23167.62s]  they're falling out off the planet,
[23167.62s -> 23175.24s]  good try, you got six animals,
[23176.24s -> 23178.24s]  I don't think I will,
[23178.24s -> 23182.83s]  asteroid fight,
[23182.83s -> 23187.37s]  there's ten of these,
[23187.37s -> 23190.00s]  I'm going to pick this random one,
[23190.00s -> 23194.16s]  this one has audio,
[23194.16s -> 23197.23s]  asteroid fight, click here to start game,
[23197.23s -> 23201.96s]  this hurts my eyes,
[23201.96s -> 23206.12s]  I'm not playing any of these,
[23206.12s -> 23208.30s]  baby beaver,
[23208.30s -> 23220.74s]  the stork is dropping a bunch of baby beavers,
[23220.74s -> 23223.74s]  earn points by catching them with a time bonus for every ten items,
[23223.74s -> 23225.74s]  catch the clocks for extra time,
[23225.74s -> 23236.24s]  did I just kill one,
[23236.24s -> 23242.00s]  oh, I'm killing them,
[23242.00s -> 23249.02s]  oops, I don't know what that was,
[23249.02s -> 23257.21s]  okay, this bounce out,
[23257.21s -> 23259.21s]  I'm not playing it,
[23259.21s -> 23261.21s]  bows and arrows,
[23261.21s -> 23266.84s]  this one doesn't even have a starting screen,
[23266.84s -> 23270.04s]  press F to fire,
[23270.04s -> 23274.78s]  oh, I don't even need to do it again,
[23274.78s -> 23276.78s]  that was fucking beautiful,
[23276.78s -> 23278.78s]  bubble bugs,
[23278.78s -> 23288.57s]  click and drag with a bubble wand to blow a bubble,
[23288.57s -> 23290.57s]  around a bug,
[23290.57s -> 23292.57s]  the more bugs you capture in a bubble,
[23292.57s -> 23340.43s]  the more points you get,
[23340.43s -> 23342.43s]  this bounce out,
[23342.43s -> 23344.43s]  I'm not gonna play any of these,
[23344.43s -> 23348.20s]  next one is called car dodge,
[23348.20s -> 23352.04s]  gotta find the right car,
[23352.04s -> 23354.04s]  I'm gonna say this one,
[23354.04s -> 23360.70s]  car dodge,
[23360.70s -> 23372.33s]  okay, ready,
[23372.33s -> 23379.23s]  I don't even understand how,
[23379.23s -> 23381.23s]  I feel like I could make this game,
[23381.23s -> 23385.32s]  I think I could,
[23385.32s -> 23388.52s]  I think I could,
[23388.52s -> 23399.72s]  chicken cross,
[23399.72s -> 23404.33s]  are we at the point where it breaks the computer?
[23404.33s -> 23406.33s]  chicken cross don't open,
[23406.33s -> 23430.25s]  I broke it,
[23430.25s -> 23432.25s]  I don't understand how that's possible,
[23432.25s -> 23444.48s]  I'm doing this the fastest anyone's ever done this,
[23444.48s -> 23469.37s]  no, no,
[23469.37s -> 23516.38s]  I,

[23564.68s -> 23576.08s]  you can't, it's not possible to win,
[23576.08s -> 23578.25s]  it's not possible to win,
[23578.25s -> 23580.25s]  even with superhuman fucking strength,
[23580.25s -> 23592.67s]  I can't beat it,
[23592.67s -> 23594.67s]  the headphones out, I'm gonna get on the ground for this,
[23594.67s -> 23601.39s]  I gotta get on the ground,
[23601.39s -> 23633.50s]  I'm still here,
[23633.50s -> 23635.50s]  it's not possible to win,

[23666.81s -> 23668.81s]  you just said that I'm just bad,
[23668.81s -> 23670.81s]  no human clicks as fast,

[23975.58s -> 23977.95s]  1, 2, 3,
[23977.95s -> 23988.64s]  go, what's happening,
[23988.64s -> 24000.35s]  oh no, it's happening too fast,
[24000.35s -> 24007.52s]  uh oh, how do I stop it,
[24007.52s -> 24009.52s]  F6, F6,
[24009.52s -> 24018.78s]  got it, okay, we're fine, where's my mouse,
[24018.78s -> 24024.28s]  so, it's too fast,
[24024.28s -> 24028.38s]  too fast, 1 millisecond,
[24028.38s -> 24034.01s]  2 milliseconds,
[24034.01s -> 24038.43s]  1 millisecond should be fine, okay,
[24038.43s -> 24040.86s]  pick a location, again,
[24040.86s -> 24043.04s]  start game, ready,
[24043.04s -> 24058.96s]  here we go,
[24058.96s -> 24060.96s]  it's not gonna register a thousand clicks a second,
[24060.96s -> 24063.20s]  I mean it is, look,
[24063.20s -> 24096.41s]  switch it to current location,
[24096.41s -> 24115.08s]  I mean it's on,
[24115.08s -> 24117.08s]  it's still too fast, how about,
[24117.08s -> 24119.08s]  how about 200 milliseconds,
[24119.08s -> 24124.08s]  current location, start,
[24124.08s -> 24139.29s]  500 milliseconds,
[24139.29s -> 24147.53s]  start, hold it, I mean, I am holding it,
[24147.53s -> 24157.45s]  click type single,
[24157.45s -> 24165.84s]  there's only single or double,
[24165.84s -> 24169.16s]  click type, there's no hold,
[24169.16s -> 24176.14s]  it doesn't work, repeat,
[24176.14s -> 24178.14s]  repeat 50,000 times,
[24178.14s -> 24180.14s]  25 milliseconds,
[24180.14s -> 24182.14s]  single click,
[24182.14s -> 24185.28s]  current location, start,
[24185.28s -> 24205.23s]  I need a hotkey then,
[24205.23s -> 24207.23s]  alright, this music's gotta shut the fuck up, I can't even handle it right now,
[24207.23s -> 24209.98s]  hotkey setting,
[24209.98s -> 24218.68s]  it's F6, so if I hit
[24218.68s -> 24223.23s]  F6 right here, F6,
[24223.23s -> 24225.60s]  current location,
[24225.60s -> 24227.60s]  25 milliseconds, 50,000 times,
[24227.60s -> 24256.78s]  F6, maybe the repeat is too high,
[24256.78s -> 24260.41s]  use the
[24260.41s -> 24262.41s]  razor tool,
[24262.41s -> 24265.55s]  restart the application,
[24265.55s -> 24267.55s]  I mean, it's very clear that we were just doing that
[24267.55s -> 24269.55s]  correct, like every other time,
[24269.55s -> 24282.03s]  unplug it, alright, I'm gonna try
[24282.03s -> 24286.12s]  a different auto clicker,
[24286.12s -> 24288.12s]  the game is gonna only register hardware
[24288.12s -> 24290.12s]  clicks, it probably doesn't register software clicks,
[24290.12s -> 24293.71s]  that's probably what's happening,
[24293.71s -> 24297.42s]  different auto clicker,
[24297.42s -> 24301.64s]  I'll give you a fucking auto clicker,
[24301.64s -> 24308.11s]  this is for all the fucking marbles,
[24308.11s -> 24356.75s]  mouse click to
[24356.75s -> 24358.75s]  scroll wheel,
[24358.75s -> 24361.12s]  that's not gonna happen, mouse
[24361.12s -> 24363.12s]  click to scroll wheel,
[24363.12s -> 24371.44s]  but I can't even do
[24371.44s -> 24377.00s]  that, how the fuck
[24377.00s -> 24392.88s]  do I do that, let me try,
[24392.88s -> 24397.10s]  hold on a second, repeat
[24397.10s -> 24399.79s]  until stopped, 10 milliseconds,
[24399.79s -> 24402.84s]  current location,
[24402.84s -> 24404.84s]  hotkey, make it like fucking
[24404.84s -> 24406.84s]  D, or like 6,
[24406.84s -> 24408.84s]  who cares, just regular 6,
[24408.84s -> 24414.65s]  G,
[24414.65s -> 24416.65s]  okay, it's currently set to G,
[24416.65s -> 24419.53s]  100 milliseconds,
[24419.53s -> 24425.29s]  let's open it up,
[24425.29s -> 24427.79s]  this fucking music is going to
[24427.79s -> 24435.53s]  drive me insane, okay,
[24435.53s -> 24443.77s]  so this is perfect,
[24443.77s -> 24445.77s]  so you're saying, get right here,
[24445.77s -> 24452.94s]  do 1 millisecond, it works,
[24452.94s -> 24456.20s]  350 milliseconds is perfect,
[24456.20s -> 24458.20s]  I'm gonna just double click type,
[24458.20s -> 24464.60s]  tab into the game,
[24464.60s -> 24475.74s]  alt tab into the game,
[24475.74s -> 24480.92s]  what does that even matter,
[24480.92s -> 24482.92s]  single click,
[24482.92s -> 24484.92s]  alright, I'm gonna have to tell you right now,
[24484.92s -> 24486.92s]  if everyone's trying to help me,
[24486.92s -> 24490.44s]  I've been told like 6 or 7 different things,
[24490.44s -> 24492.44s]  minimize the clicker,
[24492.44s -> 24495.20s]  look Jerm, look, let me see,
[24495.20s -> 24499.16s]  what am I looking at here,
[24499.16s -> 24501.16s]  free chili time, be the best,
[24501.16s -> 24503.16s]  you win, yeah, that's a lie,
[24503.16s -> 24505.34s]  you cheated,
[24505.34s -> 24507.34s]  do you see how unbelievably
[24507.34s -> 24516.17s]  fast I was clicking the screen,
[24516.17s -> 24518.17s]  yeah, you watch that clip
[24518.17s -> 24520.17s]  of me pressing the mouse like
[24520.17s -> 24523.63s]  400 times a second,
[24523.63s -> 24525.63s]  alright, that's it, I'm candidate,
[24525.63s -> 24545.08s]  that's it, I'm out,
[24545.08s -> 24547.08s]  I can't alt back into the game, it's clicking,
[24547.08s -> 24577.08s]  do the online version,
[24577.08s -> 24579.90s]  okay, let's see,
[24579.90s -> 24581.90s]  I'm curious, where's the online version,
[24581.90s -> 24586.83s]  somebody uploaded a YouTube video
[24586.83s -> 24596.30s]  of them beating this,
[24596.30s -> 24598.30s]  yeah, good job, you have your auto
[24598.30s -> 24600.30s]  clicker, you have auto clicker set up to
[24600.30s -> 24604.27s]  500,000 times a second,
[24604.27s -> 24606.27s]  nobody can fucking do that, no human can do that,
[24606.27s -> 24610.17s]  I was trying to beat it as a human,
[24610.17s -> 24613.56s]  and look, you can't even hear it,
[24613.56s -> 24622.91s]  look at this shit, that's bullshit,

[25664.88s -> 25676.91s]  B and N, I can't do it like this,
[25676.91s -> 25678.91s]  the keys are too close,
[25678.91s -> 25702.14s]  it's too hard to do this with my hands like this,
[25702.14s -> 25710.72s]  it's hard to do that,
[25710.72s -> 25714.36s]  ah, ah, ah,
[25714.36s -> 25716.36s]  yeah, animal, slow down,
[25716.36s -> 25724.49s]  this is just racing in LA,
[25724.49s -> 25731.26s]  no,
[25731.26s -> 25736.25s]  shill game, basketball,
[25736.25s -> 25745.90s]  okay, keep an eye on it,
[25745.90s -> 25762.73s]  just want to let you guys know that I
[25762.73s -> 25764.73s]  might be like a fucking 10,000
[25764.73s -> 25773.63s]  frames a second eyes,
[25773.63s -> 25783.04s]  now you missed one, it's okay,
[25783.04s -> 25785.04s]  follow that diamond queen, queen, queen,
[25785.04s -> 25787.04s]  snake shooter, it looks fun but I know
[25787.04s -> 25790.56s]  it's going to be bad, it wasn't rigged,
[25790.56s -> 25793.37s]  really, yeah, no, I can do that, the diamond
[25793.37s -> 25795.37s]  queen one was, the guy was doing all kinds of
[25795.37s -> 25797.74s]  tricks,
[25797.74s -> 25799.74s]  I win,
[25799.74s -> 25802.62s]  snowball elves, nope,
[25802.62s -> 25805.44s]  I don't think we're going to do this, space battle,
[25805.44s -> 25807.44s]  space out, no,
[25807.44s -> 25812.73s]  I don't think so, oh dear,
[25812.73s -> 25816.19s]  well, this is where they gave up,
[25816.19s -> 25826.60s]  okay, there's still
[25826.60s -> 25831.08s]  140, whoever was
[25831.08s -> 25833.39s]  designing this, spaced
[25833.39s -> 25835.39s]  the fuck out, space out, there's the original,
[25835.39s -> 25837.76s]  well, here's space shot,
[25837.76s -> 25839.76s]  I'm going to, probably 50 of these,
[25839.76s -> 25841.76s]  star fight, tomato
[25841.76s -> 25852.32s]  bounce, sure,
[25852.32s -> 25869.52s]  that other noise threw
[25869.52s -> 25874.19s]  me off pretty badly, so what
[25874.19s -> 25876.19s]  happened there is, those of you that would
[25876.19s -> 25878.19s]  flash, they just went off the
[25878.19s -> 25880.19s]  stage, kind of, and then
[25880.19s -> 25882.19s]  had to come back around here and they were
[25882.19s -> 25884.19s]  loading up this way into the, back from
[25884.19s -> 25886.19s]  the stage,
[25886.19s -> 25888.19s]  that was very interesting, UFO shootout,
[25888.19s -> 25890.19s]  don't want to play it, why'd the chicken cross the road, this,
[25890.19s -> 25892.19s]  the character art's fucking crazy,
[25892.19s -> 25895.90s]  why did two load,
[25895.90s -> 25900.44s]  pretty good art, ow,
[25906.06s -> 25915.60s]  where's the, oh, I gotta,
[25915.60s -> 25918.60s]  what,
[25918.60s -> 25930.11s]  pinball
[25930.11s -> 25932.11s]  one, ai ai ai,
[25932.11s -> 25935.05s]  oh no, it's opening a command
[25935.05s -> 25937.05s]  prompt, no, no, no,
[25937.05s -> 25939.29s]  don't you, don't, okay, hold on,
[25939.29s -> 25972.32s]  are we good, okay,
[25972.32s -> 25974.56s]  card and casino, bingo,
[25974.56s -> 25976.56s]  poker, jackpot slots,
[25976.56s -> 25978.56s]  got my
[25978.56s -> 25980.56s]  attention, let's see what we got here,
[25980.56s -> 25983.12s]  jackpot slots, 400 credits,
[25983.12s -> 25985.74s]  this is so blurry,
[25985.74s -> 25987.74s]  I can't even tell what the denomination
[25987.74s -> 25989.74s]  is, 25 cents,
[25989.74s -> 25991.74s]  it doesn't even spin,
[26014.94s -> 26017.12s]  this many, spot the card,
[26017.12s -> 26020.44s]  super slots,
[26020.44s -> 26022.44s]  ooh, I like this one, this has got some
[26022.44s -> 26028.01s]  art to it, alright,
[26028.01s -> 26031.02s]  so, max bet,
[26031.02s -> 26033.02s]  it's 100, I have, I have 100 credits,
[26033.02s -> 26035.02s]  and spin it one time,
[26035.02s -> 26041.55s]  super slots,
[26041.55s -> 26043.55s]  4th of July, super slot, it's just
[26043.55s -> 26047.39s]  the same, everything's the same,
[26047.39s -> 26049.39s]  bank robbery,
[26049.39s -> 26052.46s]  it's the same clown,
[26052.46s -> 26054.46s]  the same clown,
[26054.46s -> 26056.46s]  is there anybody that has a different, is it,
[26056.46s -> 26064.59s]  it's always a clown, I don't wanna open this one,
[26064.59s -> 26066.59s]  this is definitely one of those
[26066.59s -> 26069.98s]  fucking command prompt ones,
[26069.98s -> 26071.98s]  guess the color, guess more or less,
[26071.98s -> 26079.72s]  puzzle and board,
[26079.72s -> 26082.03s]  jigsaw puzzles,
[26082.03s -> 26087.66s]  matches, no,
[26087.66s -> 26090.22s]  sports, bow and arrows,
[26090.22s -> 26092.22s]  one, darts,
[26092.22s -> 26094.70s]  no, they got baseball,
[26094.70s -> 26097.13s]  go-karts, no,
[26097.13s -> 26099.13s]  hot, okay, this is what I
[26099.13s -> 26101.44s]  want to see, that's what I
[26101.44s -> 26103.87s]  wanted,
[26110.86s -> 26117.39s]  take at least 10 baskets,
[26117.39s -> 26138.68s]  that sucked,
[26138.68s -> 26140.68s]  is it all the same exact game,
[26140.68s -> 26142.99s]  ping pong bounce,
[26142.99s -> 26144.99s]  shooting range, what,
[26144.99s -> 26146.99s]  the fuck is this,
[26146.99s -> 26148.99s]  don't open a command prompt, it's shitty enough where it would,
[26164.33s -> 26167.21s]  how is that sports,
[26167.21s -> 26169.77s]  wacky bird hunter,
[26169.77s -> 26171.77s]  squid hunter, speedway,
[26171.77s -> 26177.72s]  how,
[26177.72s -> 26179.72s]  look at how many versions of
[26179.72s -> 26182.03s]  wacky bird hunter,
[26182.03s -> 26184.03s]  there's almost as many wacky bird hunters,
[26184.03s -> 26187.02s]  oh, uh-oh,
[26187.02s -> 26189.58s]  no, that's not good,
[26189.58s -> 26194.76s]  uh-oh,
[26194.76s -> 26196.76s]  this is the time where I feel like somebody took over the computer,
[26196.76s -> 26199.90s]  press enter to begin,
[26199.90s -> 26232.41s]  I don't have a mind right now for this,
[26232.41s -> 26234.65s]  I don't,
[26234.65s -> 26236.65s]  this is probably really fun, that's it,
[26236.65s -> 26247.85s]  1001
[26247.85s -> 26252.97s]  tangrams, does it
[26252.97s -> 26257.76s]  open, it does,
[26257.76s -> 26261.02s]  oh, it's just, I don't wanna do that,
[26261.02s -> 26264.35s]  that's pretty, that's pretty much
[26264.35s -> 26267.93s]  the end,
[26267.93s -> 26269.93s]  it's taken us more than 14
[26269.93s -> 26272.56s]  hours to go through this shit,
[26272.56s -> 26277.74s]  we're so close,
[26277.74s -> 26280.67s]  we've got, I don't know what
[26280.67s -> 26283.10s]  pentaminos are, but there's
[26283.10s -> 26289.88s]  2000 of them here, okay, it's just like
[26289.88s -> 26291.88s]  windows, dos,
[26291.88s -> 26294.89s]  3.1,
[26294.89s -> 26296.89s]  archaic, no,
[26296.89s -> 26302.96s]  not doing that one either,
[26302.96s -> 26304.96s]  500 solitary games, we already
[26304.96s -> 26306.96s]  know I'm gonna skip this one immediately,
[26306.96s -> 26314.83s]  mini golf, I know, I know,
[26314.83s -> 26316.83s]  I don't know how to play solitaire, so I'm gonna take a,
[26316.83s -> 26318.83s]  I'm gonna tell you guys what
[26318.83s -> 26320.83s]  I think solitaire is, and you can,
[26320.83s -> 26322.83s]  I'm gonna, chat's turning off,
[26322.83s -> 26325.39s]  I'm not looking at chat, solitaire
[26325.39s -> 26327.39s]  is you have a series of rows,
[26327.39s -> 26329.39s]  right, columns, and you have
[26329.39s -> 26331.39s]  to put, uh, down
[26331.39s -> 26333.39s]  or up for like
[26333.39s -> 26335.39s]  a suite, right, a suite,
[26335.39s -> 26337.39s]  suite, what?
[26337.39s -> 26339.39s]  Denomination, so if it's king,
[26339.39s -> 26341.39s]  you need to put a queen,
[26341.39s -> 26343.39s]  a jack, or a ten, it's gonna go down
[26343.39s -> 26345.82s]  in a line like this, so I don't
[26345.82s -> 26347.82s]  have anything, so I have to flip over here, so
[26347.82s -> 26349.82s]  ten, nine,
[26349.82s -> 26352.00s]  right, ten, nine, eight,
[26352.00s -> 26354.62s]  then you can move this one over here,
[26354.62s -> 26358.59s]  so then I have, now I need a
[26358.59s -> 26360.59s]  seven, or I need a jack,
[26360.59s -> 26363.71s]  there's an eight, that doesn't,
[26363.71s -> 26365.71s]  that didn't help me though, I got a
[26365.71s -> 26367.71s]  six here, I can go five,
[26367.71s -> 26373.98s]  six, you go
[26373.98s -> 26375.98s]  down or up, right, and
[26375.98s -> 26382.57s]  suites match, and
[26382.57s -> 26384.57s]  you can hold, so I can go
[26384.57s -> 26389.24s]  king, there's a
[26389.24s -> 26391.24s]  seven, I got my seven, that's what I needed,
[26391.24s -> 26406.73s]  puzzle board champion,
[26406.73s -> 26411.92s]  all right, you guys, come on, give me a little bit of slack
[26411.92s -> 26414.16s]  here, guys, I
[26414.16s -> 26417.04s]  just clicked my mouse,
[26417.04s -> 26419.40s]  maybe, maybe four
[26419.40s -> 26422.99s]  to five hundred thousand times,
[26422.99s -> 26424.99s]  I gotta get a little bit of slack here,
[26424.99s -> 26427.23s]  queens, chess, words,
[26427.23s -> 26429.23s]  bingo, battleship, knight,
[26429.23s -> 26431.40s]  checkers,
[26431.40s -> 26433.40s]  reversey, jigsaw, turns,
[26433.40s -> 26435.40s]  what is, what's battleship, I know battleship,
[26435.40s -> 26438.92s]  no, you don't even,
[26438.92s -> 26442.64s]  tokens, there's no tokens,
[26442.64s -> 26447.56s]  if there are no tokens, this is bullshit,
[26447.56s -> 26449.56s]  well, it doesn't even load, so, well, maybe it does,
[26449.56s -> 26457.88s]  I mean, no,
[26457.88s -> 26464.48s]  you don't even have graphics,
[26464.48s -> 26471.07s]  just lines, what the hell was that,
[26471.07s -> 26473.07s]  that was puzzle and board,
[26473.07s -> 26475.07s]  crystal mazes, actually,
[26475.07s -> 26477.31s]  this one, I'm actually intrigued
[26477.31s -> 26479.31s]  with what crystal mazes would be,
[26479.31s -> 26482.57s]  what is a crystal maze?
[26482.57s -> 26528.06s]  well, I was supposed to
[26528.06s -> 26530.06s]  put them into the
[26530.06s -> 26532.30s]  gold, is that what it was?
[26532.30s -> 26539.79s]  Kakuro games?
[26539.79s -> 26541.79s]  I don't know what Kakuro is,
[26541.79s -> 26550.24s]  wait, what did somebody say?
[26550.24s -> 26556.89s]  what did somebody say?
[26556.89s -> 26558.89s]  I'm seeing somebody being quoted and tell how funny
[26558.89s -> 26560.89s]  that was, what did you say?
[26560.89s -> 26614.17s]  what did they say?
[26614.17s -> 26616.17s]  I've actually seen those before and that they're
[26616.17s -> 26618.54s]  interesting, I mean,
[26618.54s -> 26620.54s]  like, Picross or
[26620.54s -> 26622.84s]  GTFO, as the kids say,
[26622.84s -> 26626.88s]  I'm a big fan of
[26626.88s -> 26634.49s]  Picross, Japanese
[26634.49s -> 26638.91s]  crosswords, and
[26638.91s -> 26641.21s]  I think, I think we got
[26641.21s -> 26645.50s]  ourselves exactly what I wanted,
[26645.50s -> 26647.50s]  one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
[26647.50s -> 26649.50s]  eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, has to be
[26649.50s -> 26651.93s]  the, yeah, this is Picross right there,
[26651.93s -> 26655.77s]  I could sit here all day and do this,
[26655.77s -> 26660.89s]  this is Picross,
[26660.89s -> 26662.89s]  I can't believe it, this is great,
[26662.89s -> 26664.89s]  one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
[26664.89s -> 26666.89s]  eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, third, the whole
[26666.89s -> 26669.20s]  thing is thirteen, it's gotta be
[26669.20s -> 26672.59s]  at least the middle, it's gotta be in here too,
[26672.59s -> 26674.59s]  so this is twelve,
[26674.59s -> 26676.59s]  twelve, it's kinda hard to gauge that,
[26676.59s -> 26678.89s]  nine, eight, three,
[26678.89s -> 26680.89s]  that's the only one, so we can go like this,
[26680.89s -> 26685.18s]  there's two here,
[26685.18s -> 26687.42s]  so it's either gonna be one,
[26687.42s -> 26689.42s]  two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,
[26689.42s -> 26691.42s]  nine, ten, eleven, twelve, that's exactly what it is,
[26691.42s -> 26693.42s]  so now we can cross
[26693.42s -> 26698.86s]  these out, so
[26698.86s -> 26700.86s]  I'll give you a quick little rundown of how
[26700.86s -> 26702.86s]  I love these, I do these all the time,
[26702.86s -> 26705.16s]  I had
[26705.16s -> 26707.16s]  two of these for the Minotenno DS a long time ago,
[26707.16s -> 26709.16s]  so, essentially,
[26709.16s -> 26711.16s]  Picross is you make a picture,
[26711.16s -> 26713.16s]  and you're given a bunch of
[26713.16s -> 26715.16s]  numbers on the edges and the top,
[26715.16s -> 26717.16s]  and what you're supposed to do is,
[26717.16s -> 26719.16s]  whatever the number is on the left side,
[26719.16s -> 26721.16s]  that's how many filled in squares are
[26721.16s -> 26723.16s]  in this area here,
[26723.16s -> 26726.11s]  in this row, it doesn't tell you where,
[26726.11s -> 26728.11s]  they just, hey, twelve of these are filled in,
[26728.11s -> 26730.92s]  hey, ten of these are filled in,
[26730.92s -> 26732.92s]  you have to figure out with logic
[26732.92s -> 26735.61s]  and your mind where they go,
[26735.61s -> 26737.79s]  also, you know why, what's going on with the
[26737.79s -> 26739.79s]  eight and the two here, what is that, what the heck is this,
[26739.79s -> 26741.79s]  that means that there is a space between
[26741.79s -> 26743.79s]  these two, so for instance, let's
[26743.79s -> 26745.79s]  say the eight was here, so one, two, three,
[26745.79s -> 26747.79s]  four, five, six, seven, eight,
[26747.79s -> 26749.79s]  or because it's here, let's just
[26749.79s -> 26751.79s]  do it this way, let's say it was one, two,
[26751.79s -> 26753.79s]  three, four, five, six, seven, eight,
[26753.79s -> 26756.48s]  this two has to be at least
[26756.48s -> 26758.48s]  one space open, that's what that
[26758.48s -> 26762.44s]  means, so, that means that there's
[26762.44s -> 26766.16s]  a space, sounds real, oh it is real,
[26766.16s -> 26768.16s]  this is one of my favorite damn things
[26768.16s -> 26772.44s]  in the world, so, thirteen was
[26772.44s -> 26774.44s]  easy because it was, there are
[26774.44s -> 26776.44s]  thirteen spaces, so it has to be thirteen,
[26776.44s -> 26781.24s]  so where it gets tricky, so this is
[26781.24s -> 26784.12s]  three, so, here's
[26784.12s -> 26786.12s]  the thing, because it's three here, it could be here,
[26786.12s -> 26789.56s]  or it could also be here,
[26789.56s -> 26791.56s]  there's really no way for me to know that right this second,
[26791.56s -> 26793.56s]  because this row is also three,
[26793.56s -> 26796.44s]  so it would have to be, let's say if the three
[26796.44s -> 26798.44s]  was this way, it would have to be one, two, three,
[26798.44s -> 26800.75s]  which would fuck this whole row up, so it is
[26800.75s -> 26803.44s]  not there, that is not where that is,
[26803.44s -> 26805.44s]  I'm gonna go ahead and put an X,
[26805.44s -> 26807.44s]  because I know that this is just a three,
[26807.44s -> 26809.87s]  nothing else is here besides
[26809.87s -> 26811.87s]  a two, and three is in the end, so
[26811.87s -> 26818.40s]  this whole side is gone, because
[26818.40s -> 26820.40s]  it's two space and then three, therefore
[26820.40s -> 26828.46s]  there can't be anything here, so it's like
[26828.46s -> 26830.76s]  Minesweeper put better, yes, way better,
[26830.76s -> 26833.77s]  in my opinion, it's actually kind of cool,
[26833.77s -> 26835.77s]  it is very cool, some pit crosses
[26835.77s -> 26838.89s]  are
[26838.89s -> 26841.07s]  hundreds of squares,
[26841.07s -> 26843.63s]  and they have insanely elaborate,
[26843.63s -> 26845.63s]  it's not just, oh a starfish, it's like a whole
[26845.63s -> 26852.59s]  picture, they're awesome, but I mean,
[26852.59s -> 26854.59s]  I don't want to bore everybody
[26854.59s -> 26859.76s]  and do it, because I'll just sit here,
[26859.76s -> 26863.64s]  no fun allowed, this sounds sweet, it is,
[26863.64s -> 26866.40s]  so we've got five, I'll do
[26866.40s -> 26868.96s]  it, fine, so five, this row has
[26868.96s -> 26870.96s]  to have five, and there are two here, so
[26870.96s -> 26874.09s]  it's very possible
[26874.09s -> 26876.09s]  this could be down here at five, because we got four,
[26876.09s -> 26878.09s]  but then space one, two, this might be part
[26878.09s -> 26881.16s]  of the eight, so if this is part of the eight,
[26881.16s -> 26883.16s]  which it is, I mean one, two, three, four,
[26883.16s -> 26885.40s]  five, six, seven, eight,
[26885.40s -> 26887.40s]  it has to go this way, has to,
[26887.40s -> 26890.86s]  because I don't think there's
[26890.86s -> 26892.86s]  any possible way that you could have the eight go this way
[26892.86s -> 26896.51s]  without the two getting screwed up there,
[26896.51s -> 26898.51s]  it's really easy to count, so there's
[26898.51s -> 26900.51s]  thirteen spaces, right, one, two, three,
[26900.51s -> 26902.51s]  four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
[26902.51s -> 26905.00s]  one, two, three, four,
[26905.00s -> 26907.00s]  five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
[26907.00s -> 26909.44s]  like they have to be here,
[26909.44s -> 26917.76s]  at least, fill a random
[26917.76s -> 26923.26s]  square, though this is twelve, but remember
[26923.26s -> 26925.26s]  this is three down here, so you have to be
[26925.26s -> 26928.65s]  careful, five and then four,
[26928.65s -> 26930.65s]  this could be the four, it's definitely
[26930.65s -> 26934.11s]  the four, three, again, this is just
[26934.11s -> 26937.24s]  three, we can mark these, nothing in here,
[26937.24s -> 26939.87s]  and nothing here,
[26939.87s -> 26943.13s]  because it has to be either
[26943.13s -> 26946.59s]  one way or the other, so they're going to keep deducing,
[26946.59s -> 26950.54s]  it's all about deduction, so that way,
[26950.54s -> 26952.54s]  six, one, two, three, four, five,
[26952.54s -> 26954.54s]  six, one, two, three, four,
[26954.54s -> 26961.07s]  five, six, can't really tell at this moment, so
[26961.07s -> 26963.69s]  I bet you it's going to go
[26963.69s -> 26965.69s]  one, two, three, four, five, six,
[26965.69s -> 26968.25s]  seven, eight, nine, ten, which that
[26968.25s -> 26970.25s]  would be the three there, and it kind of makes sense,
[26970.25s -> 26972.56s]  I'm going to go for it, so then this is three,
[26972.56s -> 26976.25s]  there has to be a space,
[26976.25s -> 26978.25s]  three is actually the end, so there has to be
[26978.25s -> 26985.16s]  a space here, two in the top row,
[26985.16s -> 26989.31s]  so there can't be anything there,
[26989.31s -> 26991.31s]  so we've got three somewhere, there's a one,
[26991.31s -> 26994.76s]  so six there, four, one, two,
[26994.76s -> 26996.76s]  three, four, five, six, one,
[26996.76s -> 26998.76s]  two, three, four, five, six, it's kind of tricky,
[26998.76s -> 27001.26s]  but I'm pretty sure you can go like this,
[27001.26s -> 27003.26s]  because that would be one, two, three, four,
[27003.26s -> 27005.26s]  five, six, one, two,
[27005.26s -> 27007.26s]  three, four, five, six, so they have to be
[27007.26s -> 27010.46s]  in the middle here somewhere, so that means
[27010.46s -> 27016.09s]  this is part of the eight as well,
[27016.09s -> 27018.97s]  looks good, I don't know where the one is,
[27018.97s -> 27020.97s]  one, two, three, four, five,
[27020.97s -> 27022.97s]  six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven,
[27022.97s -> 27025.79s]  twelve, one, two, three,
[27025.79s -> 27027.79s]  four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,
[27027.79s -> 27031.37s]  ten, eleven, twelve, very possible,
[27031.37s -> 27040.27s]  has voted to play this game
[27040.27s -> 27042.27s]  for one hour,
[27042.27s -> 27049.69s]  what, do a full
[27049.69s -> 27051.69s]  pick-cross stream one day, it would be fun
[27051.69s -> 27057.45s]  to start off slow, that would be kind of
[27057.45s -> 27062.12s]  fun, nine, six, just depends,
[27062.12s -> 27065.00s]  because this six is part of the
[27065.00s -> 27067.00s]  eight, this is three, one, two, three,
[27067.00s -> 27069.50s]  space, one, two, three, not quite,
[27069.50s -> 27072.19s]  has to be, okay, so yeah, this has,
[27072.19s -> 27074.62s]  so there we go, there it is, there's your six
[27074.62s -> 27077.37s]  right there, six is done, I
[27077.37s -> 27080.32s]  like how a lot of
[27080.32s -> 27082.32s]  pick-cross games, when you actually fill
[27082.32s -> 27084.32s]  a row or a column,
[27084.32s -> 27086.32s]  it will gray out the number, so you're not looking
[27086.32s -> 27088.32s]  at it, I wish this did it too, but
[27088.32s -> 27090.81s]  this is kind of one of a, this is one
[27090.81s -> 27092.81s]  of the more bare bones
[27092.81s -> 27094.81s]  pick-cross games I've seen,
[27094.81s -> 27098.91s]  I mean, I've seen quite a few, so again,
[27098.91s -> 27101.66s]  three, we've got two
[27101.66s -> 27104.09s]  positions here, this could be four,
[27104.09s -> 27106.09s]  and that would be one, two, three, four, five,
[27106.09s -> 27110.83s]  it could be like this, it might be,
[27110.83s -> 27116.19s]  what a gamer, no, this is just
[27116.19s -> 27118.19s]  relaxing stuff, I just used to sit here
[27118.19s -> 27122.54s]  and play these all the time, so this is three
[27122.54s -> 27124.54s]  and then two, which it could be one, two, here,
[27124.54s -> 27130.28s]  this feels like a joke,
[27130.28s -> 27135.53s]  it's not, it's
[27135.53s -> 27138.28s]  not a joke, so there has to be two,
[27138.28s -> 27143.02s]  therefore, no, this is done, so you just
[27143.02s -> 27152.48s]  mark this, it's so relaxing, I mean,
[27152.48s -> 27154.97s]  at some point you have to make a good
[27154.97s -> 27158.17s]  educated guess, so let's just
[27158.17s -> 27160.17s]  say one, two, three, four, five, six,
[27160.17s -> 27162.17s]  seven, eight, nine, one, two, three,
[27162.17s -> 27164.17s]  four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,
[27164.17s -> 27166.60s]  I'm already kind of pushing it, three,
[27166.60s -> 27170.25s]  it would, it's probably this,
[27170.25s -> 27172.25s]  but it might be the bottom, no, but
[27172.25s -> 27174.25s]  one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,
[27174.25s -> 27182.68s]  I don't know about that, what about over here?
[27182.68s -> 27186.89s]  one, three, nine, twelve,
[27186.89s -> 27192.01s]  eight, two, five,
[27192.01s -> 27194.01s]  and then, well, it could be here,
[27194.01s -> 27196.01s]  because that would be one, two, three, four, five,
[27196.01s -> 27198.01s]  and then one, two, three, four,
[27198.01s -> 27203.13s]  let's just see what that looks like, therefore,
[27203.13s -> 27212.41s]  one, two, three, four, five, six,
[27212.41s -> 27214.41s]  oh shit, one, two, three, four,
[27214.41s -> 27216.41s]  five, six, one, two, three, four,
[27216.41s -> 27219.55s]  five, six, alright, alright,
[27219.55s -> 27221.55s]  alright, hold on, one, two, three, four,
[27221.55s -> 27226.80s]  five, six, seven, it has to be
[27226.80s -> 27228.80s]  here, that's nine, one, two,
[27228.80s -> 27230.80s]  three, four, five, six, seven,
[27230.80s -> 27237.39s]  five, six, starfish
[27237.39s -> 27242.96s]  Jupiter, which way does this go,
[27242.96s -> 27255.24s]  because it could go either way, it probably
[27255.24s -> 27257.24s]  is, well, if you take a look at the
[27257.24s -> 27263.20s]  just got her in and confused, ah, I'm just
[27263.20s -> 27265.88s]  dicking around, well, you know what, here it is,
[27265.88s -> 27268.51s]  it can't go this way, there's no three
[27268.51s -> 27270.51s]  it can be here, because there's no space,
[27270.51s -> 27272.68s]  so this is one, two, three, four,
[27272.68s -> 27277.23s]  five, six, seven, eight, has to be
[27277.23s -> 27279.23s]  the three, this has to be three,
[27279.23s -> 27281.79s]  either up here or down here, there's no space,
[27281.79s -> 27288.76s]  that's it, which then we may have just got
[27288.76s -> 27295.53s]  ourselves the one, mmm,
[27295.53s -> 27300.59s]  the one might be here, it's not that hard, no,
[27300.59s -> 27302.59s]  it's not that hard, it just kind of
[27302.59s -> 27308.41s]  takes a minute to look at it, peacocks,
[27308.41s -> 27310.41s]  oh, why, did cocks come in
[27310.41s -> 27316.81s]  and delete some frames, three,
[27316.81s -> 27319.69s]  two, if that's the case,
[27319.69s -> 27324.60s]  then one, two, three, four,
[27324.60s -> 27327.10s]  five, six, seven, eight, nine,
[27327.10s -> 27330.04s]  it's probably this, I'm going to go for it,
[27330.04s -> 27334.57s]  if I'm wrong, I'm wrong,
[27334.57s -> 27336.57s]  because then that would be one, two, three, four,
[27336.57s -> 27339.52s]  five, six, seven, eight, I'll be wrong
[27339.52s -> 27342.46s]  if I need to be, which would then be one,
[27342.46s -> 27344.46s]  two, one, two, three,
[27344.46s -> 27347.02s]  space, one, two,
[27347.02s -> 27350.22s]  three, let's see if that focks anything up,
[27350.22s -> 27352.22s]  one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
[27352.22s -> 27354.46s]  eight, one, two, three, one, two, three, let's
[27354.46s -> 27360.41s]  just see, because then that lets,
[27360.41s -> 27362.41s]  that's one, two, three,
[27362.41s -> 27364.41s]  four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,
[27364.41s -> 27367.23s]  ten, eleven, twelve, that's it for this,
[27367.23s -> 27373.88s]  there's two somewhere here,
[27373.88s -> 27383.68s]  I think this comes out too, because that,
[27383.68s -> 27385.68s]  it's the way the image looks here,
[27385.68s -> 27389.50s]  so this looks correct, so I'm definitely
[27389.50s -> 27391.50s]  going to need, let's see,
[27391.50s -> 27393.87s]  because now it has to be one, two, three,
[27393.87s -> 27395.87s]  four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,
[27395.87s -> 27397.87s]  uh-oh, wait a minute here, one, two,
[27397.87s -> 27399.87s]  three, four, five, six, seven, eight,
[27399.87s -> 27402.62s]  nine, something's wrong,
[27402.62s -> 27423.98s]  I focked it up, restart,
[27423.98s -> 27431.40s]  I don't think I need to restart,
[27431.40s -> 27433.64s]  that'd be one, two, three, four, five, see if that helps,
[27433.64s -> 27445.34s]  five, six, seven, eight, nine, well that's one,
[27445.34s -> 27452.64s]  I mean it's a little janky over here, but I can fix it,
[27452.64s -> 27464.40s]  this might be, no, no,
[27464.40s -> 27466.40s]  has to be there, one, two, three, four, five,
[27466.40s -> 27472.48s]  six, seven, eight, nine, right,
[27472.48s -> 27478.56s]  it has to be there, ah,
[27478.56s -> 27480.56s]  is it though? Because then this might
[27480.56s -> 27482.86s]  have to be down here, one,
[27482.86s -> 27484.86s]  two, three, four, five, six, seven,
[27484.86s -> 27490.81s]  eight, that's focking wrong,
[27490.81s -> 27492.81s]  I think the three column is correct,
[27492.81s -> 27501.13s]  yeah, it's the perspective,
[27501.13s -> 27507.79s]  what is the two,
[27507.79s -> 27513.04s]  two would have to be like
[27513.04s -> 27516.30s]  here, here,
[27516.30s -> 27522.89s]  the nine has eight filled now, yeah,
[27522.89s -> 27524.89s]  I know, I'm just trying to figure like how I
[27524.89s -> 27528.28s]  focked this up, if the nine
[27528.28s -> 27530.28s]  can't be like that, then the threes must be down
[27530.28s -> 27536.94s]  there, yeah, bad
[27536.94s -> 27539.37s]  version of this game, no,
[27539.37s -> 27541.37s]  it's just kind of a sloppy version,
[27541.37s -> 27543.80s]  it really, I really like it when you
[27543.80s -> 27545.80s]  can actually see in real time, it helps
[27545.80s -> 27547.80s]  with being able to see,
[27547.80s -> 27549.80s]  some of them actually have it so you have like
[27549.80s -> 27551.80s]  two X's, you can do a one X that you can actually
[27551.80s -> 27560.00s]  screw up, threes, yeah, the threes
[27560.00s -> 27576.38s]  aren't identical, like that,
[27576.38s -> 27578.38s]  cause then that would be one, two, three,
[27578.38s -> 27580.38s]  four, five, six, seven, eight,
[27580.38s -> 27583.77s]  and that's based on two,
[27583.77s -> 27587.29s]  one, two, three, one, two,
[27587.29s -> 27589.29s]  one, two, one, two,
[27589.29s -> 27591.29s]  one, two, three, four, five, six,
[27591.29s -> 27593.29s]  seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven,
[27593.29s -> 27596.36s]  twelve, that's not right,
[27596.36s -> 27598.99s]  you would have to go,
[27598.99s -> 27602.83s]  it's almost there, it's almost
[27602.83s -> 27605.71s]  done, cause the starfish goes like
[27605.71s -> 27607.71s]  this, it's like the legs come down,
[27607.71s -> 27611.55s]  like this one, so almost like
[27611.55s -> 27618.20s]  this is wrong, two, three
[27618.20s -> 27620.20s]  can't be filled with it, yeah,
[27620.20s -> 27633.24s]  three, that'll be one,
[27633.24s -> 27635.24s]  two, three, four, five, six, seven,
[27635.24s -> 27638.83s]  eight, nine,
[27638.83s -> 27642.28s]  hmm, these are easy,
[27642.28s -> 27644.65s]  yeah, I know, I haven't done
[27644.65s -> 27646.65s]  them in a long time though, this is the first time I've done it
[27646.65s -> 27648.65s]  in probably like a couple of years,
[27648.65s -> 27660.68s]  and sometimes when I play these, I mean, I'm obviously
[27660.68s -> 27662.68s]  my, I'm very fucking tired,
[27662.68s -> 27664.86s]  my brain is like
[27664.86s -> 27668.25s]  a little slow at the moment,
[27668.25s -> 27671.71s]  yeah, I could do it if I sat
[27671.71s -> 27673.71s]  better, I know I could, and like I could do it,
[27673.71s -> 27677.21s]  but there it is,
[27677.21s -> 27679.21s]  I had it pretty close, I don't want
[27679.21s -> 27681.21s]  to sit here for like another twenty minutes,
[27681.21s -> 27683.96s]  it was close,
[27683.96s -> 27686.65s]  I see, right here, yeah,
[27686.65s -> 27690.30s]  I had this right the second time,
[27690.30s -> 27693.95s]  yeah, it was down here, this is what was screwing me up,
[27693.95s -> 27696.51s]  I had it correct before,
[27696.51s -> 27699.26s]  oh well, but no, seriously though,
[27699.26s -> 27701.26s]  I'll be completely honest, P-Cross
[27701.26s -> 27703.95s]  Nanograms, they are,
[27703.95s -> 27705.95s]  they are a ton of fun,
[27705.95s -> 27708.51s]  and if you are like, what the fuck are you guys
[27708.51s -> 27710.51s]  even talking about, you can start out
[27710.51s -> 27712.51s]  with like a tiny cube,
[27712.51s -> 27718.72s]  that is like this big,
[27718.72s -> 27721.28s]  hold on, can I go back, select
[27721.28s -> 27726.72s]  puzzle, as you see here,
[27726.72s -> 27729.47s]  right, they get kind of
[27729.47s -> 27738.43s]  wild, I'm looking for one that's
[27738.43s -> 27743.93s]  just a tiny one,
[27743.93s -> 27745.93s]  I can't sort by
[27745.93s -> 27748.24s]  size,
[27748.24s -> 27753.68s]  that's kind of annoying, size
[27753.68s -> 27755.68s]  nine by thirty,
[27755.68s -> 27757.68s]  just looking for like a really small one,
[27757.68s -> 27763.69s]  ten by twenty,
[27763.69s -> 27771.05s]  ten by ten is usually
[27771.05s -> 27774.96s]  very very easy,
[27774.96s -> 27776.96s]  five by five is just
[27776.96s -> 27778.96s]  absolutely impossible to fill,
[27778.96s -> 27780.96s]  but it teaches you how to do it,
[27780.96s -> 27784.60s]  twenty five by ten, that's not terrible,
[27784.60s -> 27786.60s]  one, two, three, four, five, six,
[27786.60s -> 27788.60s]  I think this is, yeah, it's twenty by twenty, so,
[27788.60s -> 27793.98s]  you can sit there and
[27793.98s -> 27795.98s]  like here, like watch,
[27795.98s -> 27800.01s]  see, do the house
[27800.01s -> 27804.43s]  tube, and this
[27804.43s -> 27806.43s]  is very,
[27806.43s -> 27808.43s]  yeah, and it's zoomed out too,
[27808.43s -> 27810.80s]  but you're probably looking at this like, oh, that's kind of crappy
[27810.80s -> 27812.80s]  looking, I guess it looks like a fish,
[27812.80s -> 27815.61s]  kind of, there are some very
[27815.61s -> 27817.61s]  very loud, especially the one for the DS was awesome,
[27817.61s -> 27823.24s]  if you search Picross in Google,
[27823.24s -> 27825.24s]  you can get a bunch of five by five ones, yeah,
[27825.24s -> 27827.55s]  they're a lot of fun,
[27827.55s -> 27830.48s]  highly recommend, they're good for
[27830.48s -> 27834.44s]  just hanging out, and hey, there you go, there's
[27834.44s -> 27837.52s]  your thousand and one
[27837.52s -> 27839.76s]  crosswords, two thousand
[27839.76s -> 27841.76s]  and two space out games, I don't want
[27841.76s -> 27843.76s]  to play it, I know what it is, I'll open it,
[27843.76s -> 27849.84s]  it's mini golf time,
[27849.84s -> 27851.84s]  oh, look, a thousand
[27851.84s -> 27853.84s]  and one space out,
[27853.84s -> 27858.57s]  so we have to go to a thousand,
[27858.57s -> 27860.57s]  wait, hold on, there's more, two thousand
[27860.57s -> 27862.57s]  and two space out games, there's twenty four
[27862.57s -> 27871.08s]  hundred of them, there's more games
[27871.08s -> 27887.15s]  on the disc, we're almost done,
[27887.15s -> 27890.03s]  we're almost done,
[27890.03s -> 27892.03s]  two days, and
[27892.03s -> 27894.33s]  fifteen hours of time,
[27894.33s -> 27896.33s]  I can't fucking believe it's almost
[27896.33s -> 27899.08s]  done, oh, don't get,
[27899.08s -> 27901.08s]  don't jump the gun that quickly,
[27901.08s -> 27903.08s]  hold on, you got Sudoku
[27903.08s -> 27912.62s]  mania,
[27912.62s -> 27917.87s]  Sudoku mania, doesn't open,
[27917.87s -> 27922.28s]  gone, I knew I should have
[27922.28s -> 27927.21s]  yeah,
[27927.21s -> 27929.77s]  are you sure about that, I don't,
[27929.77s -> 27933.93s]  there's nothing open,
[27933.93s -> 27937.00s]  my computer's
[27937.00s -> 27939.00s]  starting to slow down, it's lagging out,
[27939.00s -> 27951.10s]  no, they're multiplying,
[27951.10s -> 27958.91s]  get them up, you gotta cut the head off the snake there,
[27958.91s -> 27963.00s]  jigsaw,
[27963.00s -> 27971.20s]  three thousand jigsaw puzzles,
[27971.20s -> 27976.25s]  new, oddness,
[27976.25s -> 27978.56s]  number of tiles,
[27978.56s -> 27981.63s]  animals three,
[27981.63s -> 27985.15s]  animals three, are there any in here?
[27985.15s -> 28002.35s]  what?
[28002.35s -> 28004.35s]  porn, porn,
[28004.35s -> 28006.35s]  okay, I'm not,
[28006.35s -> 28008.35s]  I can't even open it, none of those folders
[28008.35s -> 28014.11s]  had anything in them, you
[28014.11s -> 28016.28s]  fucking psychos,
[28016.28s -> 28018.28s]  no, no, I'm getting off
[28018.28s -> 28020.28s]  that immediately,
[28020.28s -> 28032.89s]  one thousand and one mini golf games,
[28032.89s -> 28034.89s]  this is what you waited for, you guys waited this long
[28034.89s -> 28041.92s]  for this stuff,
[28041.92s -> 28045.18s]  start, where do I want to go?
[28045.18s -> 28047.68s]  more golf courses, no, this one's fine,
[28047.68s -> 28051.71s]  let's play it one,
[28051.71s -> 28064.06s]  course one, hole one,
[28064.06s -> 28066.06s]  there's a thousand and one levels apparently,
[28066.06s -> 28099.39s]  albatross,
[28099.39s -> 28101.88s]  ooh, this is gonna be fun, watch this one,
[28101.88s -> 28107.77s]  full power, straight ahead, I'm not sure
[28107.77s -> 28111.04s]  how you did that any better, how, well, how is that different?
[28111.04s -> 28125.88s]  how was that an albatross, Jeremy,
[28125.88s -> 28128.06s]  you took forever, that was like a par eight,
[28128.06s -> 28159.53s]  really, fans?
[28159.53s -> 28163.48s]  you can't even get a hole in one on this game,
[28163.48s -> 28187.79s]  uh oh, what?
[28187.79s -> 28191.18s]  I don't, you can play a better version of the game
[28191.18s -> 28193.55s]  you just watched right now for free,
[28193.55s -> 28196.56s]  it's like eleven or twelve different websites,
[28196.56s -> 28200.20s]  we already did mahjong,
[28200.20s -> 28202.51s]  we already opened this one, remember,
[28202.51s -> 28205.71s]  I did actually open that one already,
[28205.71s -> 28208.59s]  two left, we've got
[28208.59s -> 28211.53s]  the lost mine,
[28211.53s -> 28215.44s]  a thousand and one treasures,
[28215.44s -> 28217.44s]  the lost memes, somebody said,
[28217.44s -> 28219.68s]  sorry I just flashed you,
[28219.68s -> 28221.68s]  alright, challenge mode, this is gonna be match
[28221.68s -> 28223.68s]  three probably, this is a very odd
[28223.68s -> 28233.28s]  match three,
[28233.28s -> 28238.84s]  we've come down to the end,
[28238.84s -> 28242.17s]  I've opened, I've done it again,
[28242.17s -> 28245.63s]  every single one of these
[28245.63s -> 28247.63s]  fucking games has been at least attempted
[28247.63s -> 28252.36s]  to be opened, another
[28252.36s -> 28254.92s]  medjooled, so thanks
[28254.92s -> 28256.92s]  for everybody for watching this behind the scenes
[28256.92s -> 28258.92s]  stream,
[28258.92s -> 28260.92s]  three years later,
[28260.92s -> 28262.92s]  for the 700,000 games video,
[28262.92s -> 28264.92s]  because they are all
[28264.92s -> 28276.38s]  the fucking same,
[28276.38s -> 28278.38s]  end of the stream voice, yeah,
[28278.38s -> 28280.68s]  it is, it's getting there, eight hours,
[28280.68s -> 28283.69s]  little more for the bits
[28283.69s -> 28285.69s]  and the subs, it's probably like a nine
[28285.69s -> 28291.77s]  or ten hour stream, I've had
[28291.77s -> 28296.32s]  enough, changed background, I don't even know
[28296.32s -> 28299.52s]  what I'm looking at here, that one's kinda cool,
[28299.52s -> 28301.82s]  I like that one, no, dumb,
[28301.82s -> 28303.82s]  dumb, dumb,
[28303.82s -> 28306.00s]  dumb, dumb,
[28306.00s -> 28308.49s]  dumb, that was kinda cool,
[28308.49s -> 28321.04s]  astro color twist is
[28321.04s -> 28326.09s]  the final thing to open,
[28326.09s -> 28328.09s]  let's see what we have in store,
[28328.09s -> 28330.09s]  for the final click,
[28330.09s -> 28337.96s]  please play through that museum hunting
[28337.96s -> 28339.96s]  game with a story later,
[28339.96s -> 28343.42s]  if you guys really think that that was
[28343.42s -> 28345.42s]  fun, we could come back to some of these that were
[28345.42s -> 28351.31s]  more elaborate and do them,
[28351.31s -> 28353.31s]  and what do you know, 700,000
[28353.31s -> 28355.31s]  games, here you go,
[28355.31s -> 28357.31s]  final click, it doesn't do anything,
[28357.31s -> 28359.31s]  astro color twist does not even turn
[28359.31s -> 28361.93s]  on, it has been conquered
[28361.93s -> 28365.13s]  on stream, 700,000
[28365.13s -> 28371.02s]  games, what a way to
[28371.02s -> 28373.02s]  end it out, let's take a look, oh yeah,
[28373.02s -> 28376.03s]  nothing I missed, right,
[28376.03s -> 28378.03s]  that's the same, by the way that is the same
[28378.03s -> 28380.03s]  astro color twist,
[28380.03s -> 28382.03s]  I just moved it over here because I wanted to have
[28382.03s -> 28384.33s]  some extra space,
[28384.33s -> 28386.33s]  there are not two clickable
[28386.33s -> 28388.33s]  astro color twists,
[28388.33s -> 28401.05s]  welcome to hell, thank you
[28401.05s -> 28403.05s]  for joining me, everybody,
[28403.05s -> 28406.12s]  I would call that an adventure that was
[28406.12s -> 28408.12s]  about 15 hours, two days in a row,
[28408.12s -> 28412.78s]  missed one, middle
[28412.78s -> 28417.88s]  one, what, where,
[28417.88s -> 28419.88s]  what are you talking about, what did I miss,
[28419.88s -> 28426.33s]  middle, in the middle,
[28426.33s -> 28428.33s]  no that's on fire,
[28428.33s -> 28431.47s]  yeah that one's on fire,
[28431.47s -> 28436.40s]  that was the gnome one, yeah that's it,
[28436.40s -> 28440.49s]  the one with no X is the one
[28440.49s -> 28442.49s]  that's on fire, yeah,
[28442.49s -> 28448.11s]  we burnt that one, on the left
[28448.11s -> 28450.11s]  I don't see any, I think
[28450.11s -> 28452.86s]  we did them all, no we did
[28452.86s -> 28457.34s]  them all, yeah I see, we did them all,
[28457.34s -> 28460.41s]  alright guys, so
[28460.41s -> 28462.41s]  I will see you again,
[28462.41s -> 28464.59s]  today is, what is today,
[28464.59s -> 28471.31s]  today's Friday,
[28471.31s -> 28473.31s]  for me,
[28473.31s -> 28476.32s]  probably really late, so I will see
[28476.32s -> 28478.32s]  you guys again on
[28478.32s -> 28480.32s]  Saturday sun, I'll see you guys on Monday,
[28480.32s -> 28485.50s]  I'm going to
[28485.50s -> 28487.50s]  take the next couple days off,
[28487.50s -> 28491.15s]  have a fantastic weekend everybody,
[28491.15s -> 28493.58s]  thank you for sitting
[28493.58s -> 28495.58s]  through this,
[28495.58s -> 28498.97s]  this last two streams,
[28498.97s -> 28502.17s]  was this three days in a row,
[28502.17s -> 28505.18s]  yeah it was, because we did the,
[28505.18s -> 28507.18s]  was this, did I do
[28507.18s -> 28509.18s]  three streams three days in a row, I think so,
[28509.18s -> 28513.21s]  I had a lot of fun,
[28513.21s -> 28517.50s]  yeah we're going to get to the bits and we'll do the subs as well,
[28517.50s -> 28519.50s]  speaking of subs, WWW Memers
[28519.50s -> 28524.17s]  Club just gave
[28524.17s -> 28526.48s]  five community subs,
[28526.48s -> 28532.86s]  thank you so much,
[28532.86s -> 28535.29s]  what rating would I give the game,
[28535.29s -> 28538.68s]  a zero, a zero,
[28538.68s -> 28547.39s]  ten,
[28547.39s -> 28551.23s]  was this better or worse than the previous one,
[28551.23s -> 28553.23s]  it was the same one,
[28553.23s -> 28555.60s]  I don't, there was
[28555.60s -> 28557.77s]  maybe a half
[28557.77s -> 28562.19s]  dozen differences,
[28562.19s -> 28564.19s]  give out the game keys,

[28585.71s -> 28589.48s]  time waster,

[28663.29s -> 28665.29s]  look, anytime a company tries to do
[28665.29s -> 28667.29s]  something, it's an interesting idea,
[28667.29s -> 28669.29s]  to hey there's 700,000
[28669.29s -> 28672.30s]  get, but I,
[28672.30s -> 28674.30s]  you gotta, you gotta at least,
[28674.30s -> 28677.44s]  they have to work,
[28677.44s -> 28679.44s]  and if you're going to sell them, if it's going to be on
[28679.44s -> 28681.44s]  store shelves, you could buy this
[28681.44s -> 28683.44s]  game at like fucking target a couple years
[28683.44s -> 28687.02s]  ago, I mean if like half the games
[28687.02s -> 28689.02s]  on the disk don't work, at least have the
[28689.02s -> 28691.02s]  games work, and make sure that they
[28691.02s -> 28695.95s]  work, magic sphere was
[28695.95s -> 28699.53s]  really good,
[28699.53s -> 28705.72s]  super frog, always
[28705.72s -> 28711.55s]  a pleasure, that's it,
[28711.55s -> 28720.32s]  actually Jeremy, each level is a game,
[28720.32s -> 28722.32s]  so there are way more than 700,000
[28722.32s -> 28727.37s]  games, I like
[28727.37s -> 28729.37s]  the idea, I don't like the execution,
[28729.37s -> 28732.89s]  but I mean am I really giving
[28732.89s -> 28734.89s]  a rating to 700,000
[28734.89s -> 28736.89s]  games,
[28736.89s -> 28738.89s]  you can't, it's timeless, it's a classic,
[28738.89s -> 28740.89s]  it's a classic compilation
[28740.89s -> 28743.96s]  of games
[28743.96s -> 28745.96s]  that were made probably
[28745.96s -> 28747.96s]  20 years ago, that
[28747.96s -> 28750.33s]  somebody kept on a thumb drive,
[28750.33s -> 28752.33s]  and over the years they had a company
[28752.33s -> 28754.33s]  and they built it up and built it up and just kept putting them on
[28754.33s -> 28758.04s]  disks, give it a rating,
[28758.04s -> 28760.73s]  one out of 700,000,
[28760.73s -> 28764.30s]  41,
[28764.30s -> 28766.30s]  40, yeah,
[28766.30s -> 28768.30s]  410, 410,
[28768.30s -> 28775.53s]  listen, hear me out,
[28775.53s -> 28777.96s]  it's a great experience,
[28777.96s -> 28780.20s]  I had a bunch of fun, did you have
[28780.20s -> 28784.49s]  fun, I had fun,
[28784.49s -> 28786.49s]  imagine a scenario,
[28786.49s -> 28789.16s]  first of all, imagine
[28789.16s -> 28791.16s]  a scenario where this compilation
[28791.16s -> 28793.40s]  doesn't exist,
[28793.40s -> 28796.54s]  and never existed, we wouldn't
[28796.54s -> 28798.54s]  have gotten the immense joy
[28798.54s -> 28802.49s]  from fucking around with it,
[28802.49s -> 28808.96s]  and I wouldn't have the immense joy
[28808.96s -> 28811.58s]  of reinstalling windows,
[28811.58s -> 28814.78s]  because that's why I'm taking two days
[28814.78s -> 28824.56s]  off, anyway,
[28824.56s -> 28832.81s]  let's get to the bits, thank you so much
[28832.81s -> 28838.32s]  everybody for participating and watching,
[28838.32s -> 28840.32s]  next time use a virtual machine,
[28840.32s -> 28843.45s]  boomer boy, I've used
[28843.45s -> 28845.45s]  virtual machines before and I always have problems
[28845.45s -> 28847.95s]  with them, I'm too much of a
[28847.95s -> 28851.34s]  boomer, but let's go back,
[28851.34s -> 28853.34s]  let's teleport ourselves back
[28853.34s -> 28855.34s]  8 plus hours ago,
[28855.34s -> 28857.90s]  see you guys on Monday,
[28857.90s -> 28861.66s]  we'll have some fun on Monday,
[28861.66s -> 28863.66s]  got some stuff, plus
[28863.66s -> 28865.66s]  the date, the 23rd is coming up,
[28865.66s -> 28867.66s]  so, gotta prepare for that one,
[28867.66s -> 28870.03s]  hey, one key on, thanks for the one dollar,
[28870.03s -> 28872.03s]  quick, I need a pancake recipe, two eggs,
[28872.03s -> 28874.03s]  bowl of flour, bucket of
[28874.03s -> 28876.03s]  panko, breadcrumbs, sugar,
[28876.03s -> 28878.03s]  maple syrup,
[28878.03s -> 28880.03s]  use your hands, just get the fuck
[28880.03s -> 28882.20s]  in there, and then that's it,
[28882.20s -> 28884.20s]  and then don't cook that,
[28884.20s -> 28886.96s]  don't eat it either, don't make
[28886.96s -> 28889.71s]  any of that, hey, divas, thanks
[28889.71s -> 28891.71s]  for the three dollars, divas,
[28891.71s -> 28894.78s]  thank you norman games for the one dollar,
[28894.78s -> 28896.78s]  for 30 minutes of connect 4,
[28896.78s -> 28900.04s]  no, we can play connect 4 another day,
[28900.04s -> 28902.92s]  it's getting late, hey,

[28912.81s -> 28914.81s]  thanks, and you also say pride, 100,
[28914.81s -> 28919.28s]  thank you, Barney,
[28919.28s -> 28921.28s]  bake me home, thanks for one dollar,
[28921.28s -> 28923.28s]  lumpo, thanks for three dollars,
[28923.28s -> 28925.28s]  congratulations, new subsound,
[28925.28s -> 28928.73s]  I'm not sure what it was, but I'm sure it was
[28928.73s -> 28931.74s]  strange, kitty,
[28931.74s -> 28933.74s]  skinny time, thanks
[28933.74s -> 28935.74s]  for the one dollar, I'm watching
[28935.74s -> 28937.74s]  this in the bath and I laughed and dropped my laptop
[28937.74s -> 28939.74s]  in the water, thank you,
[28939.74s -> 28941.74s]  be fucking careful with electronics
[28941.74s -> 28943.74s]  near a big body of
[28943.74s -> 28949.63s]  water, oh my god,
[28949.63s -> 28953.45s]  be careful, thank
[28953.45s -> 28955.45s]  you C4G for the one dollar, hey, Jerma,
[28955.45s -> 28957.45s]  do you remember that stream
[28957.45s -> 28959.45s]  teacher noise, do you remember what it's from?
[28959.45s -> 28961.45s]  does anyone in chat have a clip?
[28961.45s -> 28964.52s]  the teacher noise stream was one of
[28964.52s -> 28966.52s]  the last streams I did from Massachusetts,
[28966.52s -> 28968.52s]  I remember because I had
[28968.52s -> 28970.52s]  one of those bulb microphones
[28970.52s -> 28972.52s]  that was like right in my mouth,
[28972.52s -> 28974.52s]  it was at some point in
[28974.52s -> 28982.14s]  late September, I'm pretty sure that
[28982.14s -> 28984.14s]  may have been the last stream, or one of the last
[28984.14s -> 28988.17s]  streams from Massachusetts, hey
[28988.17s -> 28990.54s]  it's time for SLAM, thanks for the one dollar,
[28990.54s -> 28992.54s]  it is the background that we had
[28992.54s -> 28994.84s]  the image with the slap
[28994.84s -> 28996.84s]  and the weird glowing eyes face
[28996.84s -> 28998.84s]  from earlier, thank you,
[28998.84s -> 29002.86s]  that's fucking god,
[29002.86s -> 29004.86s]  I can't even look at it,
[29004.86s -> 29007.55s]  Norman, thanks again for one dollar, please go to
[29007.55s -> 29009.55s]  rehab Jeremy,
[29009.55s -> 29012.60s]  what, why, what did I do?
[29012.60s -> 29019.07s]  thank you Ocean Gun for the ten dollars,
[29019.07s -> 29021.07s]  I find myself always looking
[29021.07s -> 29023.07s]  for your videos on a daily basis,
[29023.07s -> 29025.07s]  and honestly you're the only streamer I ever watch,
[29025.07s -> 29027.07s]  thanks for the laughs and I hope you have a
[29027.07s -> 29029.31s]  great evening, you too,
[29029.31s -> 29032.83s]  thank you for
[29032.83s -> 29034.83s]  watching, thanks for hanging out,
[29034.83s -> 29037.45s]  and always looking for my videos on a daily
[29037.45s -> 29040.20s]  basis, that, that means a lot,
[29040.20s -> 29042.20s]  I don't even know what to say, thank you,
[29042.20s -> 29045.21s]  I'm just glad you enjoy them,
[29045.21s -> 29048.67s]  and thank you again Ocean Gun for the
[29048.67s -> 29052.44s]  ten dollars,
[29052.44s -> 29054.44s]  Yaku Sai, thanks for the
[29054.44s -> 29056.44s]  one dollar, hey Gerald,
[29056.44s -> 29058.44s]  was watching your Marge Simpson stream
[29058.44s -> 29060.44s]  VOD the other day, he was thinking how much
[29060.44s -> 29062.44s]  I think you'd like Psychonauts,
[29062.44s -> 29064.44s]  I'm sure you'd appreciate the humor and charm and
[29064.44s -> 29066.44s]  think you'd have a lot of fun, it's not a
[29066.44s -> 29068.44s]  brain quiz game, by the
[29068.44s -> 29070.62s]  way, yeah I know
[29070.62s -> 29072.62s]  what Psychonauts is, I've seen it,
[29072.62s -> 29074.62s]  I've played pieces of it,
[29074.62s -> 29078.20s]  for like ten seconds,
[29078.20s -> 29080.20s]  hope you had fun with the 700,000 viruses by the way,
[29080.20s -> 29082.64s]  yeah, they were great,
[29082.64s -> 29086.09s]  it was a lot of fun, it was a journey,
[29086.09s -> 29088.09s]  if people didn't think that Psychonauts
[29088.09s -> 29090.09s]  would be that boring, maybe I would do it,
[29090.09s -> 29093.16s]  is that something that,
[29093.16s -> 29095.16s]  is that a streamable kind of game
[29095.16s -> 29097.16s]  that people would be engaged in and have fun with?
[29097.16s -> 29099.16s]  I'm all for it,
[29099.16s -> 29105.18s]  I found the teacher clip,
[29105.18s -> 29107.18s]  oh there you go, teacher clip is going
[29107.18s -> 29109.93s]  into the chat,
[29109.93s -> 29111.93s]  Kelly Dinas, thanks for the one dollar,
[29111.93s -> 29113.93s]  hey Gerald, I'm a big fan of Monster Hunter World here,
[29113.93s -> 29115.93s]  I was curious if you kept playing the game last year, and if you might
[29115.93s -> 29117.93s]  ever stream it again,
[29117.93s -> 29120.94s]  cheers, cheers to you,
[29120.94s -> 29122.94s]  I did continue playing,
[29122.94s -> 29124.94s]  I completed the whole game,
[29124.94s -> 29126.94s]  well that's not, I mean the whole game is not real,
[29126.94s -> 29128.94s]  I beat the campaign,
[29128.94s -> 29133.10s]  I went through the whole storyline,
[29133.10s -> 29135.72s]  and a little bit past it,
[29135.72s -> 29137.72s]  but I don't think I would stream Monster
[29137.72s -> 29139.72s]  Hunter World again,
[29139.72s -> 29141.72s]  I got everything I wanted out of it, I think,
[29141.72s -> 29143.96s]  I put at least,
[29143.96s -> 29145.96s]  probably 70 to 100 hours into the game,
[29145.96s -> 29147.96s]  something like that, over the course of
[29147.96s -> 29150.46s]  four weeks, I thought it was fun,
[29150.46s -> 29153.02s]  it was great,
[29153.02s -> 29156.35s]  but I'm not sure I would want to go back
[29156.35s -> 29162.62s]  and do it all over again,
[29162.62s -> 29164.62s]  what about God of War? God of War is
[29164.62s -> 29166.62s]  one of those games that's on the list currently, still,
[29166.62s -> 29168.62s]  that I need to play,
[29168.62s -> 29170.62s]  and streaming it is
[29170.62s -> 29173.50s]  very possible,
[29173.50s -> 29175.50s]  hey Timmy Timtan, thanks for the one dollar, another poor soul
[29175.50s -> 29177.50s]  lost to the evils of match three games,
[29177.50s -> 29179.50s]  wow, just play Slime Rancher,
[29179.50s -> 29181.93s]  that's another one that I've heard
[29181.93s -> 29185.07s]  is really fun, smelly boy, thanks
[29185.07s -> 29187.07s]  for the one dollar, this is a Jax Creepypasta,
[29187.07s -> 29192.19s]  Jax Creepypasta
[29192.19s -> 29194.62s]  Captain Wargon,
[29194.62s -> 29196.62s]  thanks for one dollar, Jerma NG
[29196.62s -> 29198.62s]  is more scary than BF Bugleberry
[29198.62s -> 29203.93s]  ever will be, Sir
[29203.93s -> 29205.93s]  Feline, thanks for the one dollar, the virgin Jerma
[29205.93s -> 29207.93s]  versus the Chad Daryl,
[29207.93s -> 29212.01s]  smelly boy,
[29212.01s -> 29214.01s]  thanks for the one dollar, this is melting my brain,
[29214.01s -> 29216.19s]  all of them
[29216.19s -> 29218.19s]  melted my brain, I'm pretty
[29218.19s -> 29220.19s]  brain melted, honestly it was the chili
[29220.19s -> 29223.39s]  speed clicker,
[29223.39s -> 29225.39s]  that took probably two or three years off my life,
[29225.39s -> 29228.65s]  if I was going to live to be like
[29228.65s -> 29230.65s]  140, which I mean,
[29230.65s -> 29232.65s]  come on, I'm probably going to live to be like
[29232.65s -> 29234.65s]  134
[29234.65s -> 29239.58s]  now, but
[29239.58s -> 29241.58s]  thank you, thank you FGWGWF
[29241.58s -> 29243.58s]  for the one dollar, Jerma, thank goodness he gave me another
[29243.58s -> 29245.58s]  chance to live, just whatever you do, don't read
[29245.58s -> 29250.19s]  this, call back to yesterday,
[29250.19s -> 29252.19s]  smelly boy, thanks for one dollar,
[29252.19s -> 29254.19s]  honestly can't tell who's the shitty or new character
[29254.19s -> 29256.19s]  Jerma Witch or Jerma Goggle,
[29256.19s -> 29260.78s]  so combine them, why
[29260.78s -> 29262.78s]  can't they be like a Goggle Witch,
[29262.78s -> 29268.16s]  hey space bread, thanks for the one dollar,
[29268.16s -> 29270.16s]  I played this game like 10 years ago and thought
[29270.16s -> 29272.16s]  it was just a fever dream, thank you for reviving
[29272.16s -> 29275.23s]  this memory, my pleasure,
[29275.23s -> 29277.98s]  hey RFLSA,
[29277.98s -> 29279.98s]  thanks for the two dollars,
[29279.98s -> 29281.98s]  no message, just cheer 100
[29281.98s -> 29285.24s]  twice, thank you, mandum
[29285.24s -> 29287.24s]  requiem, thanks for the one dollar, two dollars actually
[29287.24s -> 29292.88s]  from mandum,
[29292.88s -> 29294.88s]  Jerma Woggle,
[29294.88s -> 29298.08s]  Goggle Witch, Witch
[29298.08s -> 29303.39s]  Goggle, memory or
[29303.39s -> 29306.33s]  thank you Jess for the one dollar,
[29306.33s -> 29308.33s]  can you show us the capacity of your beatboxing
[29308.33s -> 29310.33s]  talent, maybe when
[29310.33s -> 29312.33s]  you originally gave this message five hours ago
[29312.33s -> 29314.33s]  maybe, I'm a little drained
[29314.33s -> 29316.33s]  right now, I'm not sure I could give you a proper
[29316.33s -> 29318.57s]  performance, but I do it from
[29318.57s -> 29321.20s]  time to time, there are people that are way
[29321.20s -> 29323.20s]  way better than me at
[29323.20s -> 29325.20s]  doing that, but sometimes it's fun
[29325.20s -> 29328.33s]  to do, hey compact viewer,
[29328.33s -> 29330.33s]  thanks for the five dollars, hey it's
[29330.33s -> 29332.33s]  me again, I don't know if you like Star Wars
[29332.33s -> 29334.33s]  games or not, but I think you should check out Star Wars
[29334.33s -> 29336.33s]  Republic Commando, it's a tactical
[29336.33s -> 29338.33s]  FPS shooter
[29338.33s -> 29340.33s]  and he links the
[29340.33s -> 29342.33s]  trailer, anyway, enjoy
[29342.33s -> 29344.33s]  the rest of the night and keep being you
[29344.33s -> 29347.72s]  I will definitely watch the trailer
[29347.72s -> 29349.72s]  let me just skim through it now
[29349.72s -> 29354.40s]  I think I've played this game
[29354.40s -> 29360.80s]  before, I feel like I've played this
[29360.80s -> 29371.16s]  I think I've, I swear to God
[29371.16s -> 29374.94s]  I've played this before
[29374.94s -> 29377.24s]  I'm not sure I would stream it
[29377.24s -> 29379.68s]  but, definitely an older one
[29379.68s -> 29381.92s]  right, it was 20
[29381.92s -> 29384.22s]  when it came out
[29384.22s -> 29386.59s]  yeah yeah yeah
[29386.59s -> 29388.59s]  thank you for the five dollars though compact viewer
[29388.59s -> 29390.83s]  I do love Star Wars
[29390.83s -> 29392.83s]  well, I do
[29392.83s -> 29395.77s]  I'm not a big fan of Star Wars
[29395.77s -> 29397.77s]  games though
[29397.77s -> 29400.59s]  maybe like, I'm trying to
[29400.59s -> 29402.59s]  think of a Star Wars game that I truly
[29402.59s -> 29408.35s]  really really loved, but I can't think
[29408.35s -> 29413.21s]  of one, but I never played The Force Unleashed
[29413.21s -> 29415.96s]  never played the Lego Star Wars
[29415.96s -> 29417.96s]  games, I played a lot of the older ones
[29417.96s -> 29419.96s]  Bounty Hunter comes to mind
[29419.96s -> 29423.23s]  I didn't play the Battlefront Star Wars
[29423.23s -> 29432.38s]  games, but thank you Alec
[29432.38s -> 29434.38s]  for the one dollar, why are you doing a gnome
[29434.38s -> 29436.62s]  what, am I killing the gnomes
[29436.62s -> 29443.40s]  look, the
[29443.40s -> 29445.40s]  gnome portion of the stream tonight
[29445.40s -> 29447.40s]  was I was
[29447.40s -> 29449.40s]  metaphorically putting every
[29449.40s -> 29451.40s]  gnome that I've had
[29451.40s -> 29454.54s]  in a gnome circle
[29454.54s -> 29456.97s]  and then
[29456.97s -> 29458.97s]  my clicking X
[29458.97s -> 29460.97s]  fire on the corner
[29460.97s -> 29470.25s]  of the screen of justice
[29470.25s -> 29477.23s]  Return of the Jedi arcade version
[29477.23s -> 29479.23s]  I metaphorically
[29479.23s -> 29486.25s]  killed the gnomes
[29486.25s -> 29489.45s]  is the Google witch in chat now?
[29489.45s -> 29493.93s]  holy shit
[29493.93s -> 29495.93s]  that's too many, that's
[29495.93s -> 29502.52s]  too many things going on
[29502.52s -> 29504.52s]  that's wrong
[29504.52s -> 29508.17s]  that's all wrong
[29508.17s -> 29510.17s]  that's a reference
[29510.17s -> 29512.17s]  to a reference, that is also a reference
[29512.17s -> 29514.99s]  to another reference, it's too much
[29514.99s -> 29522.54s]  at some point to get lost
[29522.54s -> 29524.54s]  thank you Unclean
[29524.54s -> 29526.54s]  or Unclean
[29526.54s -> 29528.54s]  for the two dollars
[29528.54s -> 29530.54s]  it's a YouTube link, let's mute just to make sure
[29530.54s -> 29533.61s]  this is not a gnome
[29533.61s -> 29535.61s]  it is, it's a gnome on a phone
[29535.61s -> 29553.58s]  is this recent?
[29553.58s -> 29562.80s]  this feels like recent
[29562.80s -> 29570.99s]  did this guy, did somebody tell
[29570.99s -> 29572.99s]  this guy that his video was famous and now
[29572.99s -> 29574.99s]  he's gonna cash the
[29574.99s -> 29584.33s]  fuck in, I don't blame him
[29584.33s -> 29586.33s]  oh man, I would
[29586.33s -> 29588.51s]  he's gonna make like 400 million
[29588.51s -> 29590.51s]  dollars from that
[29590.51s -> 29592.51s]  gnome phone app
[29592.51s -> 29598.78s]  thank you for
[29598.78s -> 29602.43s]  phone gnoming me
[29602.43s -> 29604.43s]  C4G, thanks for the one dollar, I'm sure you've answered this somewhere
[29604.43s -> 29606.43s]  but have you played the
[29606.43s -> 29608.43s]  Spider-Man DLC campaigns yet?
[29608.43s -> 29610.43s]  or have you considered them for streams? I have not
[29610.43s -> 29614.08s]  I have not considered
[29614.08s -> 29616.08s]  Spider-Man return
[29616.08s -> 29618.70s]  for a stream? I don't know
[29618.70s -> 29621.39s]  are they good?
[29621.39s -> 29623.39s]  ET phone gnome, I was gonna say that but I didn't
[29623.39s -> 29625.39s]  I was afraid we were gonna get
[29625.39s -> 29629.55s]  minus twos in the chat
[29629.55s -> 29631.55s]  I was thinking it and I was gonna say it, but you said it
[29631.55s -> 29633.55s]  so therefore you get the minus two, not me
[29633.55s -> 29641.93s]  but I don't have any plans to go back to
[29641.93s -> 29645.07s]  Spider-Man, and I haven't played the campaigns
[29645.07s -> 29648.27s]  off stream or anything, so
[29648.27s -> 29652.30s]  don't think so
[29654.30s -> 29662.24s]  how many more terrifying images of me
[29662.24s -> 29664.24s]  exist on the internet, I wonder
[29664.24s -> 29669.48s]  my fucking grandkids are gonna
[29669.48s -> 29675.69s]  see these, somehow
[29675.69s -> 29677.69s]  thank you, the only guy ever for the
[29677.69s -> 29679.93s]  one dollar
[29683.93s -> 29685.93s]  now I see why, I asked around there
[29685.93s -> 29687.93s]  and I got a word that you make your living playing children's games
[29687.93s -> 29689.93s]  and making an entity out of yourself
[29689.93s -> 29691.93s]  live on camera, so I just had to check myself out
[29691.93s -> 29693.93s]  check out for myself
[29693.93s -> 29695.93s]  glad to see you're still a loser like you always were, little guy
[29695.93s -> 29697.93s]  I also remember
[29697.93s -> 29699.93s]  I just want to let you know that we're engaged
[29699.93s -> 29701.93s]  and she's chilling with me
[29701.93s -> 29708.33s]  later, okay
[29708.33s -> 29710.33s]  that was four hours ago, where did that
[29710.33s -> 29714.75s]  come up?
[29714.75s -> 29716.75s]  at what point was that put here?
[29716.75s -> 29723.79s]  I wonder, what was I doing?
[29723.79s -> 29725.79s]  I know it's a meme, I know it's like a copy
[29725.79s -> 29727.79s]  Chad pasta
[29727.79s -> 29730.67s]  but, I mean, but
[29730.67s -> 29733.10s]  I don't even remember when that was
[29733.10s -> 29735.10s]  why?
[29735.10s -> 29738.17s]  oh, my stomach
[29738.17s -> 29740.17s]  Artium, thank you Artium for the one dollar, yo
[29740.17s -> 29742.17s]  check this sick filth out
[29742.17s -> 29771.85s]  thank you

[29776.22s -> 29778.22s]  it's not your name, but I'm gonna say it
[29778.22s -> 29780.22s]  because of today, thanks for the dollar 90
[29780.22s -> 29782.22s]  oh my god, all the photoshopped monstrosities
[29782.22s -> 29787.53s]  in this game are so good
[29787.53s -> 29790.22s]  they are, they're very good
[29790.22s -> 29792.22s]  it's probably the best part of the whole compilation
[29792.22s -> 29794.97s]  uh, thank you Jen Pendulum
[29794.97s -> 29796.97s]  for the 10 dollars
[29796.97s -> 29798.97s]  I'm so glad that I get
[29798.97s -> 29800.97s]  I'm so glad that I get on the stream as soon as
[29800.97s -> 29802.97s]  Jerma pulled out a troll face
[29802.97s -> 29808.40s]  troll face?
[29808.40s -> 29810.40s]  I made a contender for the 25 dollars
[29810.40s -> 29814.75s]  there's no
[29814.75s -> 29816.75s]  way in hell
[29816.75s -> 29818.75s]  that image is going to be an emo
[29818.75s -> 29820.75s]  no way in hell, I'm not gonna
[29820.75s -> 29825.74s]  ever click that image again
[29825.74s -> 29832.33s]  oh, that one
[29832.33s -> 29834.33s]  but thank you for
[29834.33s -> 29836.33s]  thank you Jen Pendulum for the 10 dollars

[29846.64s -> 29852.91s]  my grandkids are gonna be like
[29852.91s -> 29855.40s]  what was wrong with grandpa Jeremy
[29855.40s -> 29859.31s]  uh
[29859.31s -> 29861.31s]  heampixel, thanks for the one dollar
[29861.31s -> 29863.31s]  how many of these games do you think will make your best
[29863.31s -> 29865.31s]  games of 2019 list
[29865.31s -> 29868.56s]  um, probably
[29868.56s -> 29871.05s]  nearly zero
[29871.05s -> 29873.05s]  nearly zero cause it's possible
[29873.05s -> 29876.38s]  that one might make it
[29876.38s -> 29878.38s]  goldenfoxy, thanks for the one dollar, hey Jerma long time fan
[29878.38s -> 29883.05s]  hey can you unban my other account
[29883.05s -> 29885.42s]  uh, you say you were banned
[29885.42s -> 29889.13s]  for no reason
[29889.13s -> 29891.63s]  well, I'll tell you
[29891.63s -> 29893.63s]  account bans on the channel
[29893.63s -> 29896.06s]  are discussed by the mobs
[29896.06s -> 29899.52s]  people uh, don't get just banned
[29899.52s -> 29903.29s]  for no reason
[29903.29s -> 29905.29s]  that goes through about whether or not someone should be actually banned or not
[29905.29s -> 29911.69s]  so I don't know
[29911.69s -> 29913.69s]  I can't just be like you know what here
[29913.69s -> 29915.69s]  unban
[29915.69s -> 29917.69s]  I have no idea what the context is
[29917.69s -> 29920.19s]  can you unban
[29920.19s -> 29928.70s]  my mother
[29928.70s -> 29930.70s]  without context I can't really help you out there
[29930.70s -> 29933.71s]  but that's something that
[29933.71s -> 29935.71s]  you could probably hit a
[29935.71s -> 29937.71s]  mod up on the channel
[29937.71s -> 29943.77s]  and figure out what happened
[29943.77s -> 29945.77s]  sorry that it happened but I don't really have any context for you
[29945.77s -> 29948.40s]  and you'll say long time fan
[29948.40s -> 29950.40s]  how's it going, it's going great
[29950.40s -> 29952.40s]  hopefully you're doing well as well

[29976.83s -> 29979.77s]  yeah
[29979.77s -> 29981.77s]  I should have been more careful
[29981.77s -> 29984.72s]  unclean, thank you for the one dollar
[29984.72s -> 29986.72s]  again, good job

[30030.19s -> 30032.19s]  ended up doing
[30032.19s -> 30035.45s]  well you're talking about the
[30046.22s -> 30048.22s]  hey zeets, thanks for the one dollar, not quite my tempo

[30056.30s -> 30066.59s]  there's an image
[30066.59s -> 30068.59s]  I don't even know where that picture
[30068.59s -> 30074.99s]  that image is from
[30074.99s -> 30076.99s]  thank you himpixel for the one dollar, I can't believe a boomer
[30076.99s -> 30078.99s]  doesn't know how to play solitaire
[30078.99s -> 30082.83s]  well, you found him
[30082.83s -> 30086.22s]  korbiter, thanks for the one dollar
[30086.22s -> 30088.22s]  hey Jerma I caught a rare glimpse of the ghost that lurked
[30088.22s -> 30090.22s]  in your closet last night, I'll give you a funny story about that
[30092.97s -> 30094.97s]  so last night, here's the image
[30094.97s -> 30097.15s]  last night I turned
[30097.15s -> 30100.09s]  my webcam on
[30100.09s -> 30102.09s]  and everyone kept saying
[30102.09s -> 30104.09s]  the closet, the closet, the closet
[30104.09s -> 30106.09s]  so I put my phone in the closet
[30106.09s -> 30108.09s]  with the flashlight on facing out
[30108.09s -> 30110.09s]  with the brb screen up
[30110.09s -> 30112.09s]  and it stayed there
[30112.09s -> 30114.27s]  funny story, part two, the phone
[30114.27s -> 30116.27s]  died up there, I forgot
[30116.27s -> 30118.27s]  about it, I think like maybe
[30118.27s -> 30120.27s]  an hour and a half after I put it up there
[30120.27s -> 30122.27s]  the light is off, phone died
[30122.27s -> 30125.08s]  fast forward to today
[30125.08s -> 30127.84s]  where's my phone, where is it
[30127.84s -> 30137.56s]  oh right, I forgot
[30137.56s -> 30140.38s]  I put it up there last night
[30140.38s -> 30146.65s]  gg, idiot
[30146.65s -> 30153.63s]  thank you korbiter
[30153.63s -> 30155.87s]  hey bet3, thanks for five dollars
[30155.87s -> 30157.87s]  it's really fun watching you do p-cross games like that
[30157.87s -> 30160.04s]  I like hearing your narration
[30160.04s -> 30162.04s]  and seeing the picture take form, it's just very relaxing
[30162.04s -> 30165.31s]  don't be surprised if one day
[30165.31s -> 30167.31s]  I turn this stream on
[30167.31s -> 30170.19s]  and I got a really high quality
[30170.19s -> 30172.19s]  version of that game
[30172.19s -> 30174.68s]  and we just sit back and just sip on
[30174.68s -> 30176.68s]  some fucking tea
[30176.68s -> 30178.68s]  and just play that for like five hours
[30178.68s -> 30182.33s]  I'll be surprised
[30182.33s -> 30185.28s]  but thank you for the five dollars, bet3

[30191.76s -> 30193.76s]  Germanius
[30193.76s -> 30202.33s]  what do you mean Germanius
[30202.33s -> 30204.33s]  we have a survivor, it was a gnome
[30204.33s -> 30206.33s]  hey Logan, thank you Logan for the five dollars
[30206.33s -> 30208.33s]  hey love you germa
[30208.33s -> 30210.33s]  don't know if you saw that or not but my friends and I
[30210.33s -> 30212.33s]  cooked coffee and cheeto
[30212.33s -> 30217.84s]  styled chicken
[30217.84s -> 30219.84s]  oh my god
[30219.84s -> 30222.27s]  the quintessential germa joke needed
[30222.27s -> 30224.27s]  the quintessential meal, we made coffee, chicken and
[30224.27s -> 30226.27s]  sauce, cheeto chicken
[30226.27s -> 30228.27s]  and sauce, and finally a mixed coffee
[30228.27s -> 30230.27s]  cheeto chicken, the cheeto chicken was the best
[30230.27s -> 30233.47s]  by far
[30233.47s -> 30235.47s]  oh my fucking lord
[30235.47s -> 30244.30s]  that's fucking hilarious
[30244.30s -> 30246.99s]  I love that

[30248.99s -> 30251.16s]  sauce spoon drag
[30251.16s -> 30253.16s]  that you have in that picture
[30253.16s -> 30256.11s]  that's high quality shit

[30281.63s -> 30283.63s]  just want to say how you've helped me throughout the harsh times
[30283.63s -> 30285.87s]  I watch your VODs every day
[30285.87s -> 30287.87s]  when I come back from college
[30287.87s -> 30289.87s]  and they cheer me up every time
[30289.87s -> 30291.87s]  cheers for you and to the chat
[30291.87s -> 30293.87s]  PS please play

[30301.18s -> 30303.18s]  that's that old school FPS
[30303.18s -> 30305.18s]  doomer, boomer, whatever
[30305.18s -> 30307.18s]  that's what they call, the boomers that play doom
[30307.18s -> 30315.12s]  that was definitely, I was checking it out
[30315.12s -> 30320.17s]  thank you so much

[30329.68s -> 30331.98s]  don't be surprised
[30331.98s -> 30333.98s]  thank you jack for the one dollar
[30333.98s -> 30337.24s]  end the stream by watching the old video
[30337.24s -> 30339.24s]  the old video
[30339.24s -> 30342.62s]  oh the 700,000 video
[30342.62s -> 30344.62s]  we'll save that for monday
[30344.62s -> 30346.62s]  we'll compare the two just because
[30346.62s -> 30348.62s]  I'm fading here, I need to get some food in me
[30348.62s -> 30353.08s]  the old vid
[30353.08s -> 30355.08s]  because that's like a full ten
[30355.08s -> 30357.58s]  we'll start on monday by
[30357.58s -> 30359.58s]  just going very briefly
[30359.58s -> 30361.88s]  over, kind of
[30361.88s -> 30363.88s]  I need a couple days to compress from what we just did
[30363.88s -> 30366.19s]  are you going to forget?
[30366.19s -> 30368.19s]  I won't forget because I got
[30368.19s -> 30371.58s]  700,000 chatters
[30371.58s -> 30374.59s]  that will remind me
[30374.59s -> 30380.80s]  so don't worry, remind me to do that first thing we do
[30380.80s -> 30382.80s]  hey jenvy thanks for the one dollar, is this better than the uya?
[30382.80s -> 30385.87s]  oi, the uya
[30385.87s -> 30391.37s]  I forgot about that
[30391.37s -> 30394.38s]  fastest just
[30394.38s -> 30398.41s]  skydive into the ground
[30398.41s -> 30400.41s]  the thing about the uya is, it's probably going to be worth a shitload of money
[30400.41s -> 30403.61s]  in like 25 years
[30403.61s -> 30407.45s]  just because it existed
[30407.45s -> 30409.45s]  hey, yes is online, thanks for the five dollars
[30409.45s -> 30411.69s]  yes, I went to a bar and got shitfaced
[30411.69s -> 30414.12s]  and you were still playing the shovelware
[30414.12s -> 30416.12s]  any plans on playing the resident evil 2 remaster
[30416.12s -> 30418.12s]  yes, by the way the storyboards
[30418.12s -> 30420.12s]  for when my crew shoots with the green screen footage
[30420.12s -> 30422.12s]  in boston are almost complete and we've got a production
[30422.12s -> 30424.12s]  company that did a super bowl commercial helping
[30424.12s -> 30430.40s]  holy shit
[30430.40s -> 30433.21s]  that's
[30433.21s -> 30435.21s]  really, really, that's wild
[30435.21s -> 30439.18s]  but, resident evil 2 remaster
[30439.18s -> 30441.18s]  yes, I'm going to, day one
[30441.18s -> 30443.18s]  I'll be
[30443.18s -> 30445.18s]  one of the 500 million people streaming that game
[30445.18s -> 30448.12s]  day one
[30448.12s -> 30450.12s]  just seems like a lot of fun, I love resident evil 4
[30450.12s -> 30453.32s]  I love resident evil 5
[30453.32s -> 30455.32s]  and they're kind of doing that, they're going back and
[30455.32s -> 30457.32s]  remastering it in that style
[30457.32s -> 30459.32s]  except not really, but kind of
[30459.32s -> 30461.32s]  third person over the shoulder
[30461.32s -> 30464.27s]  I'm sure I'll love it
[30464.27s -> 30466.27s]  and the demo is already out, that's true
[30466.27s -> 30468.27s]  but I don't want to play it because I want to experience the whole thing
[30468.27s -> 30470.57s]  and I think giving myself a 30 minute demo
[30470.57s -> 30473.13s]  would just tease me
[30473.13s -> 30478.76s]  but thank you
[30478.76s -> 30480.76s]  and yes, expect that on day one
[30480.76s -> 30483.13s]  golden foxy, thanks for the one dollar
[30483.13s -> 30485.44s]  been a fan since 2012
[30485.44s -> 30489.53s]  I have something important
[30489.53s -> 30498.16s]  what is it
[30498.16s -> 30500.16s]  you say there's something important and you don't say what the important thing is
[30500.16s -> 30502.16s]  is it the band thing?
[30502.16s -> 30508.11s]  as if it is
[30508.11s -> 30510.11s]  and I talked about it about 15 minutes ago
[30510.11s -> 30514.40s]  hey Lars, bloodaxe, thanks for the five dollars
[30514.40s -> 30516.40s]  google doesn't even sound like a word anymore
[30516.40s -> 30519.40s]  good stream
[30519.40s -> 30521.40s]  goggle doesn't sound like a word anymore
[30521.40s -> 30525.61s]  not google, goggle
[30525.61s -> 30527.61s]  if you say a word enough times in a row
[30527.61s -> 30531.00s]  it doesn't sound like a real word
[30531.00s -> 30533.00s]  hey siroc, thanks for the dollar eleven
[30533.00s -> 30535.00s]  like zoinks, germa, there's a g-g-g-g-g-g-ghost
[30535.00s -> 30537.00s]  in your closet, man, you should like
[30537.00s -> 30539.00s]  call the fire department
[30539.00s -> 30541.00s]  I sent this at the beginning of the stream
[30541.00s -> 30543.00s]  but for whatever reason you-
[30543.00s -> 30545.00s]  I don't need to do it anymore, but for whatever reason you missed it
[30545.00s -> 30551.15s]  also add germaengi as an emote
[30551.15s -> 30553.15s]  fg, wg, wf, thanks for the one dollar
[30553.15s -> 30555.15s]  I wish some movie studio would just give you a budget
[30555.15s -> 30557.15s]  and tell you to make whatever the movie you want
[30557.15s -> 30559.15s]  I feel like that might be the funniest movie ever
[30559.15s -> 30561.15s]  so I guess I'll put this dollar towards the live action
[30561.15s -> 30563.15s]  death and life of
[30563.15s -> 30565.15s]  harold straight saint
[30565.15s -> 30567.15s]  sludge foundation
[30567.15s -> 30572.70s]  I mean I would
[30572.70s -> 30574.70s]  if I had a million dollars or like 10 million
[30574.70s -> 30578.28s]  dollars to make a movie
[30578.28s -> 30580.28s]  I don't even know there's so many things that I would think would be fun to make
[30580.28s -> 30582.65s]  I don't think I'd even want to make a movie
[30582.65s -> 30584.65s]  I think I just want to make a series
[30584.65s -> 30586.65s]  of like 25 different
[30586.65s -> 30588.65s]  videos and just upload them
[30588.65s -> 30591.60s]  I'm not sure a movie
[30591.60s -> 30593.60s]  there are too many things I'd like to do with that money
[30593.60s -> 30598.46s]  but thank you
[30598.46s -> 30602.43s]  golden foxy, thanks for the one dollar
[30602.43s -> 30604.43s]  do you still have your playstation 2? yes I do
[30604.43s -> 30606.92s]  it's currently in the ghost closet
[30606.92s -> 30609.87s]  it's ready to go for another night
[30609.87s -> 30612.43s]  when it's deemed necessary
[30612.43s -> 30615.05s]  hey trotter, thanks for the one dollar
[30615.05s -> 30617.05s]  saw this in chat a minute ago, thought
[30617.05s -> 30625.63s]  I'd get your eyes on it
[30625.63s -> 30627.63s]  hey germaengi, I'm planning on proposing to my lady friend
[30627.63s -> 30629.63s]  that I would love to have you officiate the wedding
[30629.63s -> 30631.63s]  from me and my loved one
[30631.63s -> 30634.19s]  I'll pay for your licensing
[30634.19s -> 30636.19s]  and we will fly to you
[30636.19s -> 30642.14s]  is that legal?
[30642.14s -> 30646.68s]  is that legal for me to do that?
[30646.68s -> 30650.14s]  officiate a wedding
[30650.14s -> 30652.14s]  oh it would be bad
[30652.14s -> 30654.14s]  it would be bad
[30654.14s -> 30656.32s]  I could stand in front
[30656.32s -> 30658.32s]  of a hundred thousand people
[30658.32s -> 30660.32s]  and do a bit
[30660.32s -> 30662.32s]  but you put me in front of like
[30662.32s -> 30664.32s]  a couple hundred of your closest
[30664.32s -> 30666.32s]  friends and family members and I'm officiating
[30666.32s -> 30668.32s]  your wedding, I'm going to turn
[30668.32s -> 30673.95s]  purple
[30673.95s -> 30675.95s]  oh my god, I would
[30675.95s -> 30681.84s]  I wouldn't know what to do
[30681.84s -> 30686.06s]  that makes it better
[30686.06s -> 30688.43s]  oh my god
[30688.43s -> 30690.43s]  imagine officiating a wedding
[30690.43s -> 30692.43s]  I don't know really either
[30692.43s -> 30699.92s]  one of the two people
[30699.92s -> 30701.92s]  we're getting the pre-recorded wedding joke scene
[30701.92s -> 30706.33s]  it's a perfect stream
[30706.33s -> 30708.33s]  oh god
[30714.52s -> 30717.66s]  well first of all
[30717.66s -> 30720.35s]  to answer that
[30720.35s -> 30722.35s]  I would really need to really think about that
[30722.35s -> 30726.51s]  the joke is you don't
[30726.51s -> 30730.22s]  know anyone
[30730.22s -> 30732.22s]  a lot of wedding officiate
[30732.22s -> 30739.58s]  orators don't know the bride or groom
[30739.58s -> 30741.58s]  it would be so hard for me to do
[30741.58s -> 30744.78s]  I could dress up in a clown costume
[30744.78s -> 30746.78s]  and fucking ride a tricycle
[30746.78s -> 30748.78s]  across the stage and have
[30748.78s -> 30750.78s]  fifty thousand people in that crowd just
[30750.78s -> 30752.78s]  pointing and laughing at me
[30752.78s -> 30754.78s]  but you give me like a bible
[30754.78s -> 30756.78s]  and stand there at the front
[30756.78s -> 30758.78s]  in like grandmas in the front row
[30758.78s -> 30761.53s]  I would
[30761.53s -> 30771.58s]  be very nervous
[30771.58s -> 30773.58s]  fly to you
[30773.58s -> 30778.57s]  you coming down to Vegas?
[30778.57s -> 30780.57s]  we are Christians so it would be in a church
[30780.57s -> 30782.57s]  just want to give you a fair warning
[30782.57s -> 30787.10s]  Vegas
[30787.10s -> 30790.24s]  make sure like
[30790.24s -> 30792.24s]  old grandma Esther is aware
[30792.24s -> 30803.12s]  that you're in like Las Vegas
[30803.12s -> 30805.12s]  that's fucking
[30805.12s -> 30807.12s]  all jokes aside
[30807.12s -> 30809.36s]  that's really really
[30809.36s -> 30811.36s]  incredibly like humbling and
[30811.36s -> 30813.36s]  grounding and that somebody would actually
[30813.36s -> 30815.36s]  want me to do that if it's not just like a joke
[30815.36s -> 30817.60s]  if it's for real
[30817.60s -> 30819.60s]  that is so I can't even fucking believe that
[30819.60s -> 30821.60s]  that is so
[30821.60s -> 30823.60s]  that's so
[30823.60s -> 30825.60s]  it's equal parts unbelievable
[30825.60s -> 30827.60s]  and equal parts
[30827.60s -> 30831.37s]  the word I want to say is
[30831.37s -> 30836.30s]  just interesting
[30836.30s -> 30838.30s]  lots of people get married in Vegas not just shotgun weddings
[30838.30s -> 30840.30s]  yeah I know
[30840.30s -> 30846.00s]  I'm just kidding around
[30846.00s -> 30851.12s]  but seriously though
[30851.12s -> 30853.12s]  if that's for real
[30853.12s -> 30855.12s]  then I would have to think about that and figure out how I would want to do that
[30855.12s -> 30857.12s]  and I'd have to like
[30857.12s -> 30859.12s]  muster up the courage to be able to do something like that
[30859.12s -> 30871.02s]  so at the moment
[30871.02s -> 30873.02s]  I'm going to have to think about that but I'm going to have to kind of
[30873.02s -> 30876.54s]  respectfully decline
[30876.54s -> 30879.04s]  just for the sake of
[30879.04s -> 30881.04s]  I don't know
[30881.04s -> 30884.56s]  if the wedding happens
[30884.56s -> 30890.38s]  invite chat
[30890.38s -> 30892.38s]  waiting for the wedding stream in five months
[30892.38s -> 30903.39s]  thank you so much
[30903.39s -> 30905.39s]  message even if it's not real then it's not real
[30905.39s -> 30907.39s]  we just spent about
[30907.39s -> 30909.39s]  10-15 straight minutes talking about it
[30909.39s -> 30914.44s]  and if it is
[30914.44s -> 30916.81s]  then that's something I would really have to think about
[30916.81s -> 30920.27s]  I'm absolutely floored
[30920.27s -> 30922.27s]  that you would even want that to happen in the first place
[30922.27s -> 30930.91s]  thank you the Jewish bro
[30930.91s -> 30932.91s]  for the one dollar do you keep Kim
[30932.91s -> 30935.98s]  up with your streams yeah
[30935.98s -> 30945.00s]  she watches them sometimes
[30945.00s -> 30947.37s]  and you know when I'm done streaming
[30947.37s -> 30949.37s]  she's usually like oh how'd it go
[30949.37s -> 30951.37s]  what'd you do
[30951.37s -> 30953.37s]  10 minutes and we just kind of move on
[30953.37s -> 30957.79s]  but yeah
[30957.79s -> 30959.79s]  thank you Ike Turtle for the one dollar I made a contender
[30959.79s -> 30961.79s]  for the 25 dollar sub emote

[30963.79s -> 30965.79s]  that was the one that was the hot dog
[30965.79s -> 30967.79s]  hot dog in the mouth
[30967.79s -> 30970.35s]  I'm just going to do this right now just to make sure
[30970.35s -> 30972.35s]  I show this right now because this will never be
[30972.35s -> 30974.35s]  an emote I'm never going to have that as an emote
[30974.35s -> 30977.74s]  just want everyone

[31212.16s -> 31214.16s]  if they add enough
[31214.16s -> 31216.16s]  where I could justify turning the

[31356.72s -> 31359.15s]  the movie night stream were
[31359.15s -> 31361.15s]  were all good they were all worth watching
[31361.15s -> 31363.64s]  some of them were
[31363.64s -> 31365.64s]  incredibly elaborate and had a lot
[31365.64s -> 31367.64s]  of work put into but that doesn't mean that the other ones weren't
[31367.64s -> 31369.64s]  worth watching and weren't fun
[31369.64s -> 31373.74s]  so no absolutely
[31373.74s -> 31375.74s]  every single one of those that was on stream
