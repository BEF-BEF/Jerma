[1.46s -> 12.30s]  Holy shit, Nightbot caught that. I didn't even press the button yet. Nightbot had my tweet come up
[12.94s -> 22.15s]  before it was pushed through to Twitter. That's kind of odd. Hey, but how are you?
[23.30s -> 36.33s]  How are you? How are you doing? Good. I'm good too. Hearthstone, are you sure about this?
[37.83s -> 44.98s]  I bet you didn't fucking think you could see this. It's alright. We actually talked last
[44.98s -> 52.87s]  night. Hold on, there's a story here. A long one. This will take about 40 seconds. It's a long
[52.87s -> 67.51s]  story. Okay, you ready? Just making sure you're ready. The story is, people were making fun
[67.51s -> 71.27s]  of me last night because of how bad I am at the game. We talked about how Hearthstone I
[71.27s -> 76.63s]  played in bed and they said, you suck. You're so bad. And I was like, fucking, I know.
[78.02s -> 88.95s]  So I figured it'd be fun if you helped me. So that's what we're gonna do. The new expansion
[88.95s -> 98.52s]  came up and chat is going to be my smart click lifeline. This is completely, yeah,
[98.52s -> 108.09s]  this is totally legal backseating. I am at chicken league. I'm going to reach out to
[108.09s -> 114.84s]  you guys like a bunch of times during games and we're gonna get to rank like 21. That's
[114.84s -> 120.28s]  all I care about. I just want to get to, I want to get to like rank like 18 or something,
[120.28s -> 134.22s]  or rank like 22. How hard is that? That's, how can you, can I do that in like a couple hours?
[135.18s -> 142.95s]  And I want, I wanted to, this is a mistake. It's, it's alright though. Cooking Simulator
[142.95s -> 152.33s]  was supposed to be today, but unfortunately I got the release date wrong and it comes
[152.41s -> 157.53s]  up tomorrow. So tomorrow we're going to play Cooking Simulator. I get, I thought it was the 5th,
[158.89s -> 164.65s]  it's the 6th. I swear to God that the release date changed. It was the 5th, I swear,
[167.48s -> 171.22s]  but whatever. We're doing it tomorrow. I'm streaming tomorrow too. So
[172.10s -> 180.49s]  it's releasing tomorrow. Cooking Simulator is tomorrow. Tonight is it going to be,
[180.49s -> 184.86s]  this is, I'm going to just give you a fair warning. I'm not going to start until I give
[184.86s -> 193.80s]  you this complete disclaimer. You are going to get frustrated on this stream. You're going
[193.80s -> 200.44s]  to be mad at me. You're going to yell at me. You're going to call me names and I'm going to
[200.44s -> 216.60s]  puff my chest out and be like, yeah, right. I'm already mad. No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
[218.09s -> 222.01s]  Here's, I've got smart clicks ready to go. I've got, look at here, I'll show you.
[222.65s -> 231.27s]  Are you ready? Here's Hearthstone. I got $45. I, yes, I did. I know. Oh, he's going to open
[231.27s -> 239.69s]  card packs on stream. He is, he, he's a normie. I know you're going to scream. I know that,
[239.69s -> 247.13s]  I already told you you're going to be mad. I fucking knew it. I told you. I, I saw it.
[247.13s -> 253.02s]  I could smell it. I had to do this because if we're going to make, you guys are going to
[253.02s -> 259.82s]  make me a deck. Look at this. I got Arena 2. You don't think I'm ready to go? You guys
[259.82s -> 264.71s]  are going to pick all this shit and then it's your fault. Don't you understand the long game
[264.71s -> 272.65s]  I'm playing here? I involve chat picking all these cards so then it doesn't matter if I lose.
[273.21s -> 282.49s]  Even if I do bad plays, this is your fault, not mine. You know, a, you got to blame the
[282.49s -> 288.98s]  tools sometimes. And if you guys are the tools, you know, if you give me a, if you give me
[288.98s -> 294.34s]  a dull hammer, how am I going to use it? I made a dull sword. How am I going to cut through
[294.42s -> 303.64s]  steel with it? It's not going to happen. All right. And there's also the solo adventure stuff.
[303.64s -> 312.74s]  I'm ready just to play, but a new expansion came out. I've been playing this in bed.
[312.74s -> 316.26s]  Let's open the fucking packs just because that's what you're here for. And then everyone's going
[316.26s -> 325.29s]  to leave and enable the clicking. Well, not right now. What do you need to enable this
[325.29s -> 335.59s]  for card packs? I got the bundle, which you get 10 of each. I was asking in chat before
[335.59s -> 344.34s]  the stream started how many of these I was going to need. I thought I was saying three,
[344.34s -> 347.37s]  but I think I need a hundred, but it doesn't matter. We're going to do,
[347.37s -> 353.74s]  we're going to, I already have a lot of fucking cards. Let us click the packs.
[353.74s -> 357.58s]  No, I'm doing it right now. This is like a big deal for me. I've never done this before
[357.58s -> 366.78s]  on stream. Only 20. Which one do I open first? This one? I'm not going to spend like
[366.78s -> 372.14s]  a fucking hundred dollars on this game. I'm going to get run out of town here. I'm
[372.14s -> 375.18s]  going to get so embarrassed on this stream. I'm not going to open this again. You think
[375.18s -> 382.38s]  I'm going to buy like $200 worth of card packs? Here we go. I better get a legendary.
[382.38s -> 398.15s]  I just opened up a card pack and got 25 subs. Holy shit. That's what was in here.
[398.15s -> 405.75s]  KDK945, 20 community subs. I should open more of these. And C4G, thanks for five
[405.75s -> 415.94s]  community subs. No, thank you. That's a lot. Thank you. Here comes a normie stream.
[416.98s -> 421.05s]  I'm going to put a disclaimer. I'm going to put a disclaimer on the screen.
[421.69s -> 426.33s]  Like here comes a normie stream. No, that's, this is a fun fucking game. I mean the game,
[426.33s -> 429.21s]  you know, what's happening to me right now. I don't know why this is happening,
[430.33s -> 434.92s]  but it was. All right. We've got, but seriously guys, thank you so much for the subs.
[435.56s -> 445.26s]  Ooh, look at that. We got blue. Are these good? Oh, I know this is good.
[445.26s -> 452.81s]  I've seen this one played before. A fight. Let me see. That's 20 more community subs.
[452.81s -> 467.03s]  This is just trash. 20 more subs from KDK. This is bad. He goes, hey everyone, let me see.
[468.18s -> 472.55s]  Oh my fucking God. Everyone's giving so, I should play Hearthstone every day.
[472.55s -> 486.09s]  That's 50 fucking dollars from Great Canadian. Is it this easy? This can't be this easy.
[486.09s -> 493.59s]  Use it to buy more packs. Thank you Great Canadian for the 50 fucking dollars.
[496.65s -> 506.60s]  Oh, okay. I'm, this is turning into a normie stream. I'm not supposed to be screaming.
[508.34s -> 511.78s]  I'm supposed to shut up today. Thanks for five. Oh, I got five subs out of this one.
[517.90s -> 521.58s]  All right. And I have to be really slow at my card pack opening, right?
[521.58s -> 524.86s]  Thank you Gnarly for the five subs. This is how you do it, right?
[524.86s -> 528.54s]  You open up a card pack and you spend like six minutes in here.
[528.54s -> 535.85s]  All right. What's in that one? I don't care what this is. I'm using it.
[535.85s -> 539.90s]  Do I have to be a shaman? Can we make an all-frog deck?
[540.46s -> 545.45s]  Can we be first to legendary with an all-toed deck, all-frog deck?
[545.45s -> 553.24s]  What class should I be? Okay, here we go. I'm so, I'm so fucking nervous right now.
[554.04s -> 556.68s]  My heart rate is like fucking 10,000 beats per second.
[559.05s -> 567.69s]  Captain Hooktusk, summon three pirates from your deck and give them rush.
[567.69s -> 572.28s]  Is that good? That's pirates. That's not good.
[575.42s -> 581.70s]  I mean, six through eight mana. This seems not very good.
[582.66s -> 585.54s]  That's not going to be the only legendary. I got 18 packs left.
[588.07s -> 591.83s]  What's in this one? Besides five community subs.
[593.99s -> 601.58s]  KDK five more subs. Oh my god. No, nothing in here.
[607.40s -> 610.20s]  I can't, I need to like look at these. Does this even matter?
[610.20s -> 618.42s]  I just, I'm looking for the good cards. Soup?
[619.94s -> 623.54s]  Soup vendor, whenever you restore three or more health to your hero, draw a card.
[623.54s -> 628.09s]  Priest? Just use a net deck. Ah, that's no fun.
[631.80s -> 634.28s]  Another 50 fucking dollars came in right now.
[637.43s -> 641.19s]  Why is the Hearthstone stream already the most profitable stream I've done
[641.75s -> 646.86s]  in the last like six weeks and it's been live for 12 minutes?
[648.46s -> 656.33s]  What? Ten more community subs. The most profitable.

[666.70s -> 671.02s]  Why is he doing this? There is a reason.
[672.89s -> 680.26s]  Oh, chicken! This thing sucks. How do you overkill something?
[680.26s -> 686.46s]  With one, is it good? This one's all right.
[686.46s -> 694.15s]  He's doing like the Care Bear thing. Oh my god, more subs.
[694.15s -> 702.54s]  Five more subs from KDK. Oh, come on.
[702.54s -> 711.34s]  Five more. What was it? 60? I got two of these now.

[798.71s -> 803.90s]  That looks all right. That's a good card.
[808.31s -> 810.79s]  Come on, give me another legendary besides that bad one that I got.
[814.28s -> 816.92s]  Recommend a good whiskey? All right, hack it fast.

[830.70s -> 833.42s]  Destroy minion costs one less for each minion you control.

[947.96s -> 949.16s]  I was like under the assumption.
[949.16s -> 952.60s]  Okay, here, before I turned the stream on, I was like, I don't know.
[952.60s -> 954.20s]  Are people gonna like this?

[1021.53s -> 1022.89s]  This is a boomer card?
[1022.89s -> 1024.54s]  That doesn't make any fucking sense.
[1024.54s -> 1026.62s]  This game came out like six years ago.

[1131.82s -> 1132.94s]  opening up card packs.

[1198.70s -> 1199.02s]  Thank you.
[1199.66s -> 1201.58s]  Stream sucks from 1914.
[1201.58s -> 1202.54s]  Thanks for 50 dollars.
[1209.83s -> 1211.11s]  I opened him in the wrong order.
[1211.11s -> 1212.79s]  I'm fucking delete the stream.
[1212.79s -> 1213.67s]  I'm never coming back.
[1218.86s -> 1221.26s]  Shadowy figure, transform into a 2-2 copy.
[1221.26s -> 1221.76s]  Trash.
[1229.94s -> 1231.22s]  Bye, thanks for the stream.
[1235.16s -> 1236.28s]  Ooh, another golden.
[1236.92s -> 1238.66s]  50 dollars.
[1239.46s -> 1240.42s]  Press space bar.
[1240.42s -> 1242.34s]  No, because that opens it all immediately.
[1242.34s -> 1243.94s]  I like to drag it over like it's in my hand.
[1248.09s -> 1248.81s]  What's a good card?
[1248.81s -> 1251.96s]  This.
[1251.96s -> 1253.00s]  The lackeys are good, right?
[1253.88s -> 1260.44s]  Bala koala, 50 dollars.
[1260.44s -> 1261.48s]  I've never played Hearthstone.
[1261.48s -> 1262.28s]  I just want to fit in.
[1268.58s -> 1274.55s]  Uh, get like another 50 packs.
[1274.55s -> 1275.35s]  I'm not doing that.
[1281.21s -> 1282.01s]  Boo, boo.
[1282.57s -> 1284.89s]  Boo, you got to click on the screen and help me win games.
[1286.36s -> 1288.78s]  He's gone full normie mode.
[1288.78s -> 1289.66s]  Alert.
[1289.66s -> 1290.94s]  Normie levels are rising.
[1292.38s -> 1301.21s]  We got to get him to like click on like people puking on YouTube before he gets to normie.
[1314.31s -> 1318.38s]  This stuff sucks.
[1319.02s -> 1320.26s]  Ray of frost.
[1321.08s -> 1322.04s]  All right, twin spell.
[1322.04s -> 1324.04s]  That means so you can cast it twice.
[1324.60s -> 1326.84s]  So twin spell is just echo for spells.
[1327.48s -> 1328.92s]  I need a reaction face cam.
[1328.92s -> 1330.20s]  No, I'm not doing that.
[1331.32s -> 1332.04s]  Ray of frost.
[1332.04s -> 1333.24s]  This is this is kind of good.
[1333.24s -> 1333.88s]  Freeze a minion.
[1333.88s -> 1335.72s]  It's very frozen to one mana.
[1337.26s -> 1339.86s]  I I'm not.
[1339.86s -> 1340.42s]  No, I'm not.
[1340.42s -> 1341.62s]  I can't put a webcam on.
[1343.51s -> 1344.71s]  I physically can't turn it on.
[1344.71s -> 1345.83s]  I will get banned from Twitch.
[1351.50s -> 1353.74s]  I got three fucking legendaries.
[1355.58s -> 1356.14s]  I haven't.
[1356.14s -> 1356.94s]  Okay, you know what?
[1356.94s -> 1358.70s]  This is really has to be waited.
[1359.77s -> 1360.49s]  You know what I'm saying?
[1361.13s -> 1363.53s]  There's no way I haven't like opened.
[1363.53s -> 1366.01s]  I haven't bought card packs in probably three to four years.
[1366.65s -> 1366.97s]  Maybe.
[1367.98s -> 1373.91s]  I mean, this has got to be like Diablo three when you didn't play for long enough.
[1373.91s -> 1375.67s]  They just gave you legendaries, right?
[1375.67s -> 1377.14s]  We go.
[1378.94s -> 1380.62s]  Let's play some fucking hype music.
[1380.62s -> 1382.33s]  Like, what's that?
[1382.33s -> 1384.25s]  What's that one that everybody always says to play?
[1384.25s -> 1384.97s]  Fucking who cares?
[1390.70s -> 1396.17s]  Is any good?
[1401.30s -> 1403.94s]  Add a copy of each of the battle cry minion.
[1404.50s -> 1406.33s]  Now he's turning into a YouTuber.
[1407.13s -> 1409.62s]  That's a lot of dust.
[1414.26s -> 1415.22s]  Five, four, five.
[1416.02s -> 1417.86s]  Add a copy of each of the best.
[1417.86s -> 1419.22s]  The game's gotten so confusing.
[1420.02s -> 1420.66s]  Battle cry.
[1420.66s -> 1422.90s]  Add a copy of each of your battle cry minions to your like.
[1423.78s -> 1428.50s]  What have I happened to like the two, three alligator and like deal two damage?
[1429.06s -> 1430.90s]  This is too much for me.
[1430.90s -> 1439.18s]  That was in 2015.
[1444.60s -> 1445.24s]  Double rare.
[1445.88s -> 1450.18s]  Destroy minions, summon two minions at the same cost to replace it.
[1450.18s -> 1451.62s]  You guys are going to just fucking have to help me here.
[1451.62s -> 1452.10s]  Look at this one.
[1453.90s -> 1454.62s]  Death destroy.
[1454.62s -> 1456.22s]  This looks, this is really good.
[1456.86s -> 1459.72s]  This is like the best card I think I've ever seen.
[1459.72s -> 1465.06s]  There's a two, six taunt that when it's destroyed, it kills a random minion.
[1465.06s -> 1466.74s]  This is like the best card in the whole game.
[1474.60s -> 1475.80s]  Is it, am I, is this correct?
[1475.80s -> 1477.00s]  Is this the best card in the game?
[1477.00s -> 1478.20s]  Because it has to be.
[1478.20s -> 1481.16s]  If there are better cards than this, the power creep has gotten too much.
[1488.30s -> 1488.94s]  Yeah, yeah.
[1488.94s -> 1491.82s]  You're asking chat for, of course I'm asking chat for advice
[1491.82s -> 1494.30s]  because I'm going to be having click maps on this whole time.
[1494.30s -> 1496.30s]  And just, we're going to make our arena deck too.
[1496.30s -> 1496.78s]  Last pack.
[1498.98s -> 1500.66s]  Come on, give me your energy.
[1500.66s -> 1501.70s]  Give me your energy.
[1502.58s -> 1507.34s]  Legendary, legendary, legendary, legendary, legendary.
[1514.86s -> 1520.62s]  Whenever you play a one cost minion, draw a spell from your deck.
[1520.62s -> 1520.86s]  Cool.
[1521.66s -> 1524.30s]  I don't feel complete though.
[1524.30s -> 1531.43s]  I like feel like I don't feel, was it connection interrupted?
[1531.43s -> 1532.79s]  What the hell did that say?
[1532.79s -> 1534.94s]  What was that?
[1538.26s -> 1538.98s]  More packs.
[1538.98s -> 1540.42s]  I'm not buying more packs.
[1540.42s -> 1546.23s]  Try get another pack.
[1547.11s -> 1550.02s]  How much is one pack?
[1550.02s -> 1550.90s]  No, no, no, no.
[1550.90s -> 1551.86s]  Let me make, hold on.
[1551.86s -> 1554.58s]  No, I'm not just sitting here and make opening fucking cards.
[1555.30s -> 1558.94s]  Can't you, you know, you can get packs.
[1558.94s -> 1564.34s]  By the way, don't look at this because this is like from 2013.
[1565.30s -> 1569.85s]  And Boo played like 600 of these games.
[1572.49s -> 1575.85s]  Like Boo like played these games for me.
[1575.85s -> 1577.05s]  I swear to God, that's for real.
[1577.85s -> 1580.97s]  See, look, I can get like money.
[1581.61s -> 1583.98s]  All right, you guys ready?
[1583.98s -> 1585.54s]  We're not doing this yet.
[1585.54s -> 1588.42s]  I'm not, no, Boo's really good.
[1588.42s -> 1589.78s]  Boo was like legend.
[1589.78s -> 1591.78s]  Boo got to legend like at least twice or something.
[1591.78s -> 1592.58s]  He's really good.
[1595.66s -> 1597.82s]  So I have it, I have this queued up.
[1597.82s -> 1599.50s]  You've been waiting a long time for this.
[1599.50s -> 1601.50s]  I know you desperately want to click on the screen.
[1601.50s -> 1602.94s]  You want to spam the screen.
[1605.66s -> 1621.37s]  It's time for you guys to pick fucking hero back.
[1621.37s -> 1622.25s]  Why would I click back?
[1623.45s -> 1625.21s]  Those votes are not being counted.
[1625.21s -> 1631.22s]  Straight from opening decks to building decks.
[1633.48s -> 1634.12s]  I got to milk it.
[1634.12s -> 1634.60s]  You know what I mean?
[1639.26s -> 1640.22s]  Garrosh is hot.
[1641.46s -> 1642.98s]  Like as in he's really good.
[1644.62s -> 1645.90s]  All right, let's go.
[1646.70s -> 1649.18s]  That's by a pretty overwhelming majority at this point.
[1649.18s -> 1661.03s]  It's going to be warrior.
[1661.03s -> 1665.24s]  Now what?
[1665.24s -> 1668.23s]  See, I'm thinking, I'm thinking,
[1669.29s -> 1670.33s]  I'm not going to tell you what I think.
[1675.67s -> 1677.11s]  Why are you clicking down here?
[1677.11s -> 1678.55s]  Stop clicking down here.
[1678.55s -> 1679.43s]  I'm not going to click this.
[1681.32s -> 1683.48s]  I'm going to refer, this sucks.
[1685.38s -> 1691.03s]  This sucked back in 2013.
[1691.03s -> 1692.07s]  You don't want to do this.
[1692.07s -> 1694.92s]  This looks fun.
[1694.92s -> 1698.22s]  I'm wrong.
[1698.22s -> 1699.02s]  Actually wrong.
[1699.02s -> 1699.34s]  Okay.
[1699.98s -> 1713.70s]  If I were me, actually, I don't know.
[1713.70s -> 1714.74s]  I don't know what I would do for me.
[1725.48s -> 1727.08s]  You guys are too split here.
[1727.08s -> 1728.28s]  Don't click this.
[1731.69s -> 1733.93s]  This is going to take so long.
[1735.93s -> 1739.93s]  All right, we're going to, no.
[1740.97s -> 1742.01s]  It's going to happen real quick.
[1742.01s -> 1744.28s]  Divine shield.
[1744.28s -> 1747.78s]  Let's go.
[1747.78s -> 1749.70s]  By the way, I'm going to pick the next five cards.
[1750.26s -> 1754.01s]  Pick right.
[1754.01s -> 1754.57s]  Wow.
[1754.57s -> 1755.85s]  28, 28, 28.
[1755.85s -> 1756.73s]  Holy shit.
[1756.73s -> 1768.09s]  Gain five armor, draw a card.
[1768.09s -> 1769.05s]  You guys sure?
[1769.05s -> 1769.53s]  Are you sure?
[1775.91s -> 1782.34s]  Shield block?
[1782.34s -> 1782.66s]  Okay.
[1787.91s -> 1790.31s]  Each player gets a two, three weapon and six armor.
[1790.31s -> 1792.79s]  You're holding a spell that costs five more to four damage.
[1792.79s -> 1796.41s]  It's a seven, seven dragon.
[1796.97s -> 1802.94s]  Don't you have to pay to play in this game mode?
[1802.94s -> 1803.66s]  Yes.
[1803.66s -> 1804.86s]  Or you just use coins.
[1805.42s -> 1808.66s]  All right, we're going to go weapons project.
[1809.22s -> 1815.90s]  This is going to take like an hour.
[1817.18s -> 1818.22s]  This is going to be worth it.
[1824.23s -> 1826.31s]  I click on the pretty cards.
[1827.67s -> 1831.21s]  Horse rider?
[1831.21s -> 1833.38s]  You know, what about the guy?
[1833.38s -> 1835.30s]  Look, you guys aren't going to want to click the guy getting zapped?
[1835.94s -> 1836.18s]  Deal.
[1836.18s -> 1836.82s]  One damn statement.
[1836.82s -> 1838.10s]  If it survives, add a lackey.
[1838.10s -> 1838.82s]  That's awesome.
[1842.57s -> 1843.85s]  That's so cool.
[1843.85s -> 1847.26s]  This is boring.
[1847.26s -> 1850.22s]  It's just a two, one attack.
[1850.22s -> 1851.61s]  Fine.
[1852.25s -> 1863.66s]  Another 50 fucking dollars came in.
[1863.66s -> 1865.66s]  50 dollars from some guy.
[1866.62s -> 1867.74s]  Some guy nine.
[1867.74s -> 1873.80s]  More packs plus doom OST or fucking riot.
[1873.80s -> 1875.86s]  Golden force tank.
[1875.86s -> 1876.74s]  Oh, nice.
[1877.64s -> 1878.36s]  I agree.
[1878.36s -> 1887.35s]  I would have picked that one too.
[1887.35s -> 1888.47s]  It's riot time.
[1888.47s -> 1890.87s]  I'm not doing 50 dollars in card packs.
[1892.78s -> 1893.42s]  Gain four.
[1893.42s -> 1894.31s]  Yep.
[1894.31s -> 1895.03s]  Definitely.
[1895.03s -> 1895.83s]  You guys are smart.
[1900.66s -> 1903.06s]  I'm not going to do 50 dollars in card packs.
[1903.06s -> 1905.30s]  That's going to take like 40 minutes.
[1911.27s -> 1913.91s]  Oh, it kind of juries out on this one.
[1918.25s -> 1920.01s]  Has plus one attack while damage.
[1920.01s -> 1923.27s]  And then, I mean, always knife juggler, right?
[1923.27s -> 1929.27s]  All right, we're almost a third of the way there.
[1929.27s -> 1932.92s]  Okay, I'm going to pick after this,
[1932.92s -> 1934.28s]  I'm going to pick the next five cards.
[1935.02s -> 1938.86s]  And you guys are going to have to work with what I pick because I'm not,
[1938.86s -> 1941.34s]  this is, this is taking like, no, what do you mean no?
[1941.98s -> 1944.90s]  Just open packs until people stop donating.
[1946.50s -> 1952.90s]  Mechanically, yeah, he's really good.
[1954.06s -> 1955.42s]  I remember, who told me that?
[1958.74s -> 1961.06s]  This one, I don't even need your guy's opinion on this.
[1961.06s -> 1962.42s]  It's always this one, right?
[1962.42s -> 1962.82s]  Always.
[1963.38s -> 1964.90s]  Every single time, right?
[1964.90s -> 1973.27s]  This is the one that goes, and then has like 40 damage, right?
[1973.83s -> 1980.68s]  Yeah, I like this one because it's just going like,
[1991.99s -> 1994.49s]  see, I just said that, now everyone's clicking on it.
[1997.40s -> 2003.08s]  Armorsmith, two more seconds.
[2004.30s -> 2011.86s]  Two, one, okay, come on.
[2011.86s -> 2013.30s]  Come on, give me a good one.
[2013.30s -> 2014.34s]  Make me a good deck, guys.
[2017.85s -> 2021.05s]  This deck looks awful, by the way.
[2021.05s -> 2024.41s]  Terrible, you failed.
[2030.66s -> 2031.54s]  Oh, look at this one.
[2033.30s -> 2034.66s]  I had to click that one, look at it.
[2043.83s -> 2055.29s]  Okay, your turn.
[2055.29s -> 2056.25s]  Wow, so cool.
[2056.25s -> 2057.13s]  Hearthstone's so cool.
[2057.13s -> 2058.09s]  Open more packs.
[2058.09s -> 2058.65s]  Dumbass.
[2063.26s -> 2067.03s]  All right, this shuffle a bomb into your opponent's deck,
[2067.03s -> 2067.83s]  when yeah, this one's cool.
[2068.47s -> 2072.70s]  You guys are dealing with a toddler right now, you understand?
[2072.70s -> 2074.06s]  Like, if I see something that I think is cool,
[2074.06s -> 2075.10s]  I mean, I'm about to click it.
[2075.96s -> 2077.88s]  I'm close to clicking this just because of this.
[2078.52s -> 2084.36s]  All right, each player gets two, three weapons, six armor.
[2084.36s -> 2085.16s]  Each player?
[2085.80s -> 2090.02s]  Why would I want to give somebody some six armor
[2090.02s -> 2092.10s]  and a two, three weapon to the other player?
[2092.10s -> 2104.04s]  I don't want to give that person anything so I can destroy them.
[2109.96s -> 2111.56s]  I'm not clicking back.
[2111.56s -> 2113.24s]  We have to make with complete this.
[2113.24s -> 2115.32s]  I'm not going to get halfway through and then not do this.
[2119.99s -> 2121.99s]  I mean, I'm pretty biased on this one.
[2121.99s -> 2123.03s]  This is an original card.
[2124.02s -> 2124.58s]  Yeah, I agree.
[2125.46s -> 2127.93s]  Some of you guys are really smart.
[2128.92s -> 2131.00s]  No epics or legendaries or anything?
[2131.00s -> 2132.52s]  How many rares have we even seen?
[2132.52s -> 2133.02s]  One?
[2136.74s -> 2140.84s]  These votes are not counted.
[2140.84s -> 2144.36s]  Five more community subs from Austin Atlantis.
[2145.08s -> 2147.72s]  Thank you so much for the five community subs.
[2148.44s -> 2148.84s]  Steel?
[2148.84s -> 2152.39s]  I thought this was the worst card in the game.
[2152.39s -> 2153.19s]  Play single player?
[2153.19s -> 2153.91s]  I am, don't worry.
[2154.87s -> 2156.87s]  This ain't going to be like a two-hour long stream.
[2156.87s -> 2158.23s]  This is going to be a long one.
[2158.23s -> 2160.38s]  This is going to be at least three hours.
[2160.38s -> 2161.08s]  I'm kidding.
[2161.08s -> 2164.33s]  It's going to be like eight.
[2164.33s -> 2164.83s]  Okay.
[2166.17s -> 2169.72s]  Guys, you got to make me the deck first before you do anything.
[2169.72s -> 2170.84s]  Hopefully these cards are good.
[2176.54s -> 2178.30s]  We have too many two and three drops.
[2181.46s -> 2183.62s]  My whole deck is going to be two drops.
[2184.57s -> 2185.93s]  Give your weapon plus one attack?
[2193.94s -> 2196.34s]  Am I going to even beat one person with this?
[2196.98s -> 2200.76s]  Two drop OP in Arena.
[2200.76s -> 2201.56s]  Is it?
[2201.56s -> 2204.36s]  More shield block?
[2209.02s -> 2210.78s]  Not the like ninja turtle enemy?
[2211.77s -> 2212.49s]  All right.
[2212.49s -> 2219.11s]  You have bad two drops.
[2219.67s -> 2224.78s]  Do I even have any taunts?
[2227.48s -> 2227.96s]  No, I don't.
[2227.96s -> 2230.20s]  I think this is the only taunt card that's showed up.
[2230.20s -> 2234.41s]  I have a really bad mana curve.
[2234.97s -> 2239.35s]  All right, we're getting close.
[2239.91s -> 2240.71s]  Final ten here.
[2249.98s -> 2250.70s]  Mad bomber.
[2253.59s -> 2255.99s]  Big clicks coming in on giggling inventor.
[2263.00s -> 2263.56s]  This is going to be...
[2264.12s -> 2268.10s]  I got to weight this one up.
[2268.10s -> 2269.46s]  Inventor sucks?
[2269.46s -> 2271.67s]  That's okay.
[2272.23s -> 2273.59s]  I didn't even look at the mana.
[2273.59s -> 2276.57s]  I thought this was like a two or three drop card.
[2276.57s -> 2277.85s]  It's seven fucking mana?
[2280.33s -> 2280.97s]  That's two.
[2280.97s -> 2282.41s]  That's kind of not good.
[2284.02s -> 2284.98s]  It used to be five.
[2288.71s -> 2289.91s]  It got nerfed.
[2289.91s -> 2290.71s]  Well, here we go.
[2291.27s -> 2299.40s]  All right.
[2299.40s -> 2300.60s]  That's how good it is.
[2300.60s -> 2302.14s]  Oh, I see.
[2302.14s -> 2303.50s]  Three mana, four, five.
[2303.50s -> 2304.46s]  Okay, Jerma.
[2305.10s -> 2308.22s]  Someone has seven, seven mechanical dragon.
[2308.78s -> 2311.42s]  Okay.
[2311.42s -> 2324.10s]  Anoyotron is like, is the best, all right?
[2324.10s -> 2324.90s]  I'm about to click it.
[2325.54s -> 2327.38s]  Just so I can hear him do his voice line.
[2333.75s -> 2335.03s]  Snake Jupiter?
[2335.03s -> 2337.32s]  All right, here we go.
[2341.45s -> 2344.58s]  Oh, yeah.
[2344.58s -> 2348.20s]  This is the best card in a ring up.
[2348.20s -> 2350.28s]  Behold the might of storm.
[2351.32s -> 2354.44s]  Storm, storm wind.
[2354.44s -> 2354.76s]  I got it.
[2354.76s -> 2355.16s]  Here we go.
[2355.96s -> 2360.97s]  You must have to sing when you do these cards.
[2362.70s -> 2374.44s]  Ah, ah, another zoo.
[2374.44s -> 2377.82s]  I got rid of two zoos.
[2377.82s -> 2378.54s]  Fine.
[2378.54s -> 2391.26s]  Who clicked that?
[2391.90s -> 2392.92s]  Gain four armor.
[2392.92s -> 2393.96s]  Someone ran a four cost minion.
[2393.96s -> 2395.00s]  That's pretty good.
[2395.00s -> 2400.04s]  I don't have any zero or one drops and I have no late game.
[2400.04s -> 2405.74s]  Can I get any cards?
[2405.74s -> 2407.50s]  I need some like epics and some legendaries.
[2407.50s -> 2408.78s]  Two ironforged portals.
[2409.34s -> 2412.25s]  Can we make it three ironforged portals?
[2418.02s -> 2418.74s]  Armorsmith.
[2422.18s -> 2422.90s]  All right.
[2422.90s -> 2423.46s]  Crowd favorite.
[2423.46s -> 2426.18s]  Whenever you play a card with battlecry, gain plus one, one.
[2430.10s -> 2430.98s]  Oh, look.
[2430.98s -> 2431.86s]  A one drop.
[2435.69s -> 2437.45s]  At least I'll have something to play.
[2442.04s -> 2442.44s]  All right.
[2442.44s -> 2443.08s]  Only two more.
[2445.11s -> 2445.83s]  We're almost done.
[2451.13s -> 2452.41s]  Rarity does not mean good.
[2452.41s -> 2453.21s]  Yeah, that's true.
[2453.21s -> 2454.17s]  Another one drop.
[2454.17s -> 2454.73s]  They hurt us.
[2460.36s -> 2460.68s]  All right.
[2461.32s -> 2461.88s]  What do we got?
[2464.63s -> 2465.91s]  Omega Devastator.
[2466.47s -> 2469.85s]  If you have 10 mana crystals, deal 10 damage to a minion.
[2470.81s -> 2471.77s]  Super Collider.
[2471.77s -> 2474.65s]  After you attack a minion, force it to attack one of its neighbors.
[2475.37s -> 2477.91s]  What?
[2486.28s -> 2487.96s]  That's like unfair.
[2491.93s -> 2492.41s]  All right.
[2495.08s -> 2496.66s]  All right.
[2496.66s -> 2499.93s]  I'm ready.
[2499.93s -> 2500.73s]  Let's try one.
[2500.73s -> 2501.45s]  Let's try two.
[2501.45s -> 2502.01s]  Let's go.
[2502.01s -> 2507.02s]  Are you ready?
[2507.02s -> 2507.98s]  I'm ready to go.
[2507.98s -> 2510.58s]  What do you guys think?
[2510.58s -> 2511.34s]  Hold on.
[2511.34s -> 2514.12s]  Let me just make sure this is...
[2514.12s -> 2515.08s]  Is this working?
[2515.08s -> 2515.64s]  All right, there we go.
[2515.64s -> 2517.70s]  Okay.
[2517.70s -> 2518.66s]  All right, let's go.
[2518.66s -> 2522.07s]  Oh, wait.
[2522.07s -> 2522.55s]  It's not on.
[2522.55s -> 2524.47s]  Is it on screen?
[2524.47s -> 2527.59s]  Oh, by the way, for all the stream snipers, get fucked.
[2538.62s -> 2546.98s]  Get it off.
[2546.98s -> 2548.02s]  Oh, shit.
[2548.02s -> 2548.10s]  What?
[2548.10s -> 2548.66s]  That's my name.
[2548.66s -> 2549.46s]  I don't want anybody to see that.
[2549.46s -> 2554.31s]  I will.
[2554.31s -> 2555.03s]  All right, here we go.
[2555.03s -> 2556.15s]  I don't need any help this game.
[2556.15s -> 2556.47s]  Ready?
[2557.21s -> 2557.45s]  Bang.
[2558.01s -> 2558.49s]  Hold this.
[2562.68s -> 2573.85s]  Oh, I got a one drop right off the bat.
[2573.85s -> 2575.05s]  Cover up your name.
[2575.05s -> 2575.29s]  Why?
[2580.22s -> 2582.58s]  Come on.
[2582.58s -> 2583.22s]  Come on.
[2583.22s -> 2583.62s]  Let's go.
[2589.03s -> 2590.55s]  Cover your name.
[2590.55s -> 2590.95s]  Why?
[2590.95s -> 2591.43s]  What's wrong?
[2595.14s -> 2596.50s]  People know that's my name.
[2596.50s -> 2599.16s]  Oh, he got a legendary.
[2599.16s -> 2600.12s]  He automatically wins.
[2603.42s -> 2603.74s]  All right.
[2603.74s -> 2606.06s]  So he's got a golden portrait, too.
[2606.06s -> 2607.42s]  This means that he plays.
[2607.42s -> 2612.39s]  When does this minion take damage?
[2612.71s -> 2613.27s]  Okay, here we go.
[2613.27s -> 2613.91s]  Ready?
[2613.91s -> 2619.64s]  What?
[2619.64s -> 2621.16s]  I got roped off.
[2621.16s -> 2621.40s]  What?
[2621.96s -> 2622.44s]  Hold on.
[2622.44s -> 2624.20s]  I want to get roped.
[2624.20s -> 2625.72s]  I was like five seconds.
[2626.28s -> 2633.96s]  That just like hurt me.
[2637.37s -> 2640.94s]  Oh, what the fuck do I do?
[2641.66s -> 2646.23s]  The rope is early.
[2646.23s -> 2648.55s]  Each player equips two, three weapon and gains six armor.
[2648.55s -> 2649.35s]  And then I'm going to hit him.
[2664.57s -> 2665.21s]  Pretty good play.
[2665.77s -> 2671.66s]  What do you mean order?
[2671.66s -> 2671.90s]  What?
[2675.27s -> 2680.84s]  What is this one?
[2680.84s -> 2681.96s]  Shuffle the bomb into your opponent's neck.
[2681.96s -> 2683.48s]  When drawn, it explodes for five damage.
[2687.02s -> 2687.58s]  That's not bad.
[2699.48s -> 2700.76s]  You're B.M.ing this person.
[2700.76s -> 2701.32s]  No, I'm not.
[2701.32s -> 2706.50s]  What are you talking about?
[2706.50s -> 2708.66s]  Add two 4-4 dragons to your hand.
[2713.91s -> 2714.23s]  Okay.
[2714.23s -> 2714.71s]  Well, you can see.
[2716.01s -> 2716.25s]  All right.
[2716.25s -> 2716.57s]  Help me.
[2716.57s -> 2717.29s]  What do you want me to do?
[2720.79s -> 2721.27s]  Quick, quick.
[2721.27s -> 2722.07s]  I don't have much time.
[2724.23s -> 2725.67s]  What are you clicking on?
[2725.67s -> 2726.98s]  I don't have much time.
[2739.80s -> 2740.84s]  This is not going to work.
[2745.50s -> 2746.46s]  Are you serious?
[2749.05s -> 2757.27s]  There's no way you play the game.
[2757.27s -> 2758.55s]  I told you that I was not going to.
[2758.55s -> 2760.55s]  I just go back to the single player.
[2760.55s -> 2762.41s]  Okay.
[2762.41s -> 2768.76s]  Actually, I just do this.
[2769.32s -> 2771.67s]  I'm just going to portal up.
[2774.54s -> 2774.86s]  Come on.
[2774.86s -> 2775.42s]  That sucks.
[2775.98s -> 2776.86s]  That sucks.
[2777.50s -> 2789.38s]  He's just going to kill that right now.
[2789.38s -> 2793.46s]  People are coming and expecting good Hearthstone gameplay.
[2793.46s -> 2795.70s]  I'm going to have to make a disclaimer.
[2797.72s -> 2798.84s]  He's got good cards.
[2799.64s -> 2801.34s]  All right.
[2801.34s -> 2802.22s]  Well, I'm going to kill that.
[2802.22s -> 2804.62s]  And then I'm going to mad bomber first.
[2804.62s -> 2805.34s]  Well, now, wait a minute.
[2805.34s -> 2806.78s]  Hold on here.
[2806.78s -> 2807.26s]  Wait a minute.
[2807.26s -> 2813.21s]  Hold on here.
[2813.21s -> 2814.01s]  Super Collider.
[2815.51s -> 2816.63s]  Kill the dragon.
[2816.63s -> 2821.62s]  Oh, check this shit up.
[2828.92s -> 2829.40s]  Hit this.
[2829.40s -> 2829.64s]  Okay.
[2830.20s -> 2831.08s]  I'm going to kill this guy.
[2831.08s -> 2831.72s]  I'm going to hit this guy.
[2831.72s -> 2832.44s]  I'm going to kill the dragon.
[2835.22s -> 2835.70s]  Bingo.
[2837.32s -> 2837.88s]  Oh, fuck.
[2837.88s -> 2838.60s]  I forgot.
[2838.60s -> 2838.84s]  Okay.
[2838.84s -> 2839.24s]  I forgot.
[2839.24s -> 2841.24s]  I thought I just did the damage that he...
[2841.24s -> 2850.38s]  I got it.
[2850.38s -> 2850.70s]  What?
[2851.82s -> 2852.86s]  I don't have one of those.
[2853.50s -> 2859.99s]  All right.
[2859.99s -> 2863.26s]  I'm going to mad bomber and annoy-a-tron.
[2865.14s -> 2868.81s]  Or I could mechanical whelp and annoy-a-tron.
[2868.81s -> 2869.13s]  No.
[2869.13s -> 2870.25s]  Mad bomber, annoy-a-tron.
[2882.57s -> 2883.45s]  I just have to last.
[2884.09s -> 2885.61s]  I have no draw either.
[2885.61s -> 2890.82s]  Is this my serious boomer tactics?
[2890.82s -> 2892.90s]  Guys, I'm not even going to look at this chat anymore.
[2893.62s -> 2900.39s]  What do you mean attack him?
[2905.58s -> 2905.82s]  No.
[2905.82s -> 2906.22s]  What?
[2906.22s -> 2907.02s]  I can...
[2907.02s -> 2909.90s]  Now I'm going to attack Illidan because he's going to kill two people.
[2915.94s -> 2916.50s]  Okay.
[2916.50s -> 2917.62s]  Watch this shit.
[2917.62s -> 2919.46s]  He's going to kill both these people.
[2919.46s -> 2927.10s]  Let me see.
[2927.10s -> 2927.90s]  Divine Charge.
[2927.90s -> 2928.22s]  Hold on.
[2928.22s -> 2928.62s]  I could do...
[2929.34s -> 2933.98s]  Wait.
[2933.98s -> 2934.94s]  It doesn't hit both people?
[2935.50s -> 2937.02s]  Force attack one of its neighbors.
[2937.02s -> 2937.66s]  Oh, fuck.
[2937.66s -> 2938.86s]  Well, here comes the RNG.
[2938.86s -> 2939.18s]  Ready?
[2940.94s -> 2941.50s]  Check this out.
[2945.82s -> 2946.54s]  Left.
[2946.54s -> 2946.94s]  Left.
[2947.66s -> 2948.14s]  Yes.
[2949.02s -> 2955.91s]  Oh, what was that?
[2955.91s -> 2956.39s]  A secret?
[2957.11s -> 2957.67s]  Doesn't matter.
[2968.23s -> 2969.67s]  Okay.
[2969.67s -> 2970.47s]  I got to settle down.
[2971.11s -> 2982.26s]  Guaranteed victory.
[2982.26s -> 2982.74s]  Guaranteed.
[2985.82s -> 2993.78s]  No, that's not good.
[2993.78s -> 2995.30s]  Your deck sucks and you're bald.
[2996.26s -> 2996.66s]  All right.
[2998.20s -> 2998.68s]  Here we go.
[2998.68s -> 2999.00s]  Ready?
[2999.56s -> 3001.16s]  Whack into this guy.
[3002.54s -> 3004.70s]  They've been kind to me before.
[3004.70s -> 3008.26s]  They've been kind to me before.
[3008.26s -> 3009.38s]  They'll be kind to me again.
[3009.94s -> 3017.43s]  Let me see.
[3017.43s -> 3018.63s]  I could go right in the middle here.
[3045.40s -> 3046.52s]  I'm not going to rope him.
[3046.52s -> 3047.32s]  I'm just trying to...
[3048.28s -> 3049.24s]  I'm trying.
[3049.32s -> 3049.72s]  It's like...
[3058.46s -> 3059.18s]  Holy shit.
[3059.90s -> 3070.38s]  I forgot that comes out.
[3070.38s -> 3071.10s]  I'm in a good position.
[3076.07s -> 3079.59s]  This guy has two legendaries in his fucking deck.
[3083.43s -> 3084.47s]  Is that even possible?
[3090.34s -> 3091.94s]  Oh, get out of here.
[3091.94s -> 3092.34s]  I can't...
[3092.98s -> 3101.70s]  Do I just get rid of these?
[3115.77s -> 3116.57s]  I'm still all right.
[3116.57s -> 3122.22s]  I mean, he has more cards, but he's going to melt down?
[3122.22s -> 3124.78s]  No, I'm about to freeze up.
[3124.78s -> 3131.45s]  What are you going to do?
[3131.45s -> 3131.93s]  What are you going to do?
[3131.93s -> 3132.89s]  I'm going right...
[3133.61s -> 3134.89s]  Better write this down.
[3134.89s -> 3135.62s]  Don't matter.
[3135.62s -> 3136.42s]  He's on the ropes.
[3136.42s -> 3137.22s]  No, I'm going right to the face.
[3139.58s -> 3140.22s]  Oh, yeah.
[3140.22s -> 3140.78s]  Excuse me.
[3147.98s -> 3149.26s]  You got to rush me down here.
[3149.26s -> 3162.74s]  Hammer the face with one damage?
[3162.74s -> 3163.70s]  Why would I do that?
[3185.88s -> 3188.12s]  This guy's got amazing cards.
[3188.68s -> 3196.57s]  I'm going to have to hit this.
[3198.68s -> 3199.32s]  So, I mean...
[3201.11s -> 3201.59s]  RNG.
[3201.59s -> 3203.10s]  Here we go.
[3203.10s -> 3203.82s]  It's going to hit him.
[3204.46s -> 3205.10s]  It's going to do it.
[3210.57s -> 3213.38s]  I almost busted that up.
[3214.02s -> 3214.34s]  All right.
[3214.34s -> 3214.82s]  Here we go.
[3215.77s -> 3217.29s]  I need to get people out here.
[3217.29s -> 3223.21s]  It's not over.
[3223.21s -> 3224.65s]  I'm going to top deck something.
[3224.65s -> 3230.36s]  He had two legendaries.
[3230.36s -> 3230.92s]  Remember that.
[3237.51s -> 3238.07s]  Three legendaries.
[3238.07s -> 3239.51s]  He had three legendaries.
[3239.51s -> 3241.67s]  How do you even get three legendaries in a Reno?
[3245.00s -> 3247.00s]  My whole deck is two drops.
[3249.16s -> 3249.72s]  It's all right.
[3249.72s -> 3250.20s]  Here we go.
[3250.20s -> 3250.68s]  Top deck.
[3250.68s -> 3251.48s]  That's the best one.
[3252.04s -> 3253.48s]  You guys got mad at me for picking this.
[3253.48s -> 3256.94s]  Give a friendly demon one...
[3256.94s -> 3257.42s]  It's over.
[3258.38s -> 3270.47s]  Concede?
[3270.47s -> 3271.27s]  I don't concede.
[3271.91s -> 3273.34s]  They have to earn it.
[3278.01s -> 3279.21s]  No, it's well played.
[3280.09s -> 3280.41s]  Thanks.
[3281.42s -> 3281.98s]  It's all right.
[3281.98s -> 3283.10s]  That was unfair.
[3285.21s -> 3285.77s]  Unfair.
[3286.49s -> 3324.42s]  Here we go.
[3324.42s -> 3325.46s]  Your deck sucks.
[3326.34s -> 3328.07s]  What am I doing?
[3328.07s -> 3331.83s]  I'm pretending to click the button so I can avoid stream snipers.
[3331.83s -> 3338.65s]  All right.
[3338.65s -> 3340.30s]  This is a better start.
[3340.30s -> 3341.26s]  Dump it all.
[3341.26s -> 3345.22s]  Does it matter?
[3345.22s -> 3346.02s]  No, not really.
[3346.02s -> 3347.06s]  Who cares?
[3347.06s -> 3348.04s]  Told you to dump it all.
[3348.04s -> 3348.36s]  Look at that.
[3348.36s -> 3349.08s]  I got a good start here.
[3349.64s -> 3352.02s]  And I get the coin.
[3352.02s -> 3353.06s]  Coin Anoyotron.
[3353.70s -> 3354.18s]  First thing.
[3356.81s -> 3358.49s]  Coin Anoyotron.
[3358.49s -> 3374.74s]  Oh, I got a Rager too.
[3374.74s -> 3376.02s]  Maybe just delete that from the game.
[3376.02s -> 3377.70s]  It's like too easy to hurt people.
[3377.70s -> 3378.02s]  All right.
[3378.02s -> 3378.50s]  Now look.
[3378.50s -> 3379.30s]  We got options here.
[3379.30s -> 3379.46s]  All right.
[3379.46s -> 3383.10s]  So like Anoyotron or Armor Up.
[3383.66s -> 3389.42s]  I'm going to say Anoyotron.
[3389.42s -> 3398.34s]  On the ropes here.
[3398.34s -> 3398.82s]  What do you got?
[3399.62s -> 3400.66s]  Draw a mech from your deck.
[3402.76s -> 3404.92s]  I think this is a coin Rager opportunity here.
[3404.92s -> 3405.24s]  Oh, no.
[3405.24s -> 3406.44s]  This is not a coin Rager.
[3406.44s -> 3410.04s]  This is a divine shield charge horse rider.
[3410.04s -> 3411.99s]  Or it's a Rager.
[3411.99s -> 3412.55s]  Just get rid of it.
[3418.39s -> 3419.51s]  Coin Rager.
[3419.51s -> 3434.50s]  Did I do that wrong?
[3435.77s -> 3436.97s]  That was that wrong?
[3436.97s -> 3438.79s]  That wasn't wrong, right?
[3438.79s -> 3450.06s]  Well, what would you do in this scenario?
[3450.06s -> 3450.78s]  Quick, quickly.
[3451.50s -> 3452.38s]  I don't have much time.
[3452.38s -> 3454.38s]  I'm not going to click end turn.
[3454.38s -> 3455.26s]  All right.
[3455.26s -> 3455.50s]  Okay.
[3455.50s -> 3456.70s]  I see what you guys want me to do.
[3456.70s -> 3457.50s]  I see it.
[3457.50s -> 3457.98s]  14%.
[3459.46s -> 3460.58s]  18% want me to do.
[3460.58s -> 3460.74s]  Okay.
[3460.74s -> 3479.22s]  Got it.
[3479.22s -> 3479.78s]  What?
[3479.78s -> 3481.75s]  I had to get...
[3481.75s -> 3482.47s]  I don't want...
[3482.47s -> 3483.67s]  It's a hunter.
[3483.67s -> 3484.79s]  Hunters have tons of minions.
[3485.99s -> 3487.18s]  You missed the lethal.
[3492.62s -> 3494.14s]  Let's go get those card packs.
[3494.78s -> 3495.58s]  I'm good at that.
[3495.58s -> 3496.62s]  I'm good at doing that.
[3497.34s -> 3505.37s]  Well, here's a mech, right?
[3505.37s -> 3506.41s]  It's in this...
[3506.41s -> 3508.49s]  Give a random friendly beast dragon and murloc.
[3508.49s -> 3508.97s]  Plus I don't...
[3508.97s -> 3509.29s]  I only have...
[3509.29s -> 3509.85s]  I have a beast.
[3510.57s -> 3513.78s]  Do the weapon here.
[3513.78s -> 3521.83s]  That's not bad.
[3531.45s -> 3532.25s]  Yeah, pretty good.
[3538.57s -> 3539.53s]  You're delaying the stream.
[3539.53s -> 3540.89s]  What if you're getting stream sniped?
[3540.89s -> 3541.69s]  I mean, everybody...
[3541.69s -> 3542.17s]  If you...
[3542.17s -> 3542.89s]  Okay.
[3542.89s -> 3545.37s]  If you were stream sniping, you watched me build the deck.
[3545.37s -> 3547.61s]  So you already know all my cards anyway.
[3547.61s -> 3548.25s]  It don't matter.
[3549.85s -> 3557.96s]  Let's see.
[3557.96s -> 3558.84s]  What do I got here?
[3558.84s -> 3559.88s]  That's not a bad idea.
[3562.90s -> 3563.70s]  Just go for it.
[3563.70s -> 3564.58s]  Four cost minion.
[3565.22s -> 3567.83s]  I think that's what I'm going to do.
[3570.74s -> 3571.46s]  Come on, something big.
[3572.02s -> 3572.66s]  That's...
[3572.66s -> 3573.22s]  All right.
[3573.22s -> 3573.94s]  I'm okay with that.
[3573.94s -> 3574.66s]  That's pretty good.
[3586.97s -> 3598.89s]  God damn it.
[3598.89s -> 3599.69s]  There's the reaper.
[3603.14s -> 3603.62s]  Reaper.
[3603.62s -> 3604.58s]  I'm just going to reaper.
[3615.53s -> 3616.33s]  Time to reap.
[3621.77s -> 3622.41s]  Oh, come on.
[3623.13s -> 3623.69s]  Three, six.
[3624.76s -> 3625.64s]  What is that thing?
[3625.64s -> 3626.92s]  Your death arrows trigger twice.
[3633.35s -> 3636.23s]  I think I got to get out the force tank.
[3638.42s -> 3639.22s]  No.
[3639.22s -> 3645.29s]  Taunt and kill the dark iron dwarf.
[3646.94s -> 3648.06s]  Taunt and kill the dwarf.
[3648.87s -> 3650.23s]  And then get some armor.
[3674.78s -> 3675.50s]  Hey, it's all right.
[3675.50s -> 3680.70s]  When you get to 0-2, you play all the other chumps that are 0-2, right?
[3680.70s -> 3695.53s]  And then they go face with their spells.
[3695.53s -> 3696.25s]  You are the chump.
[3696.25s -> 3697.53s]  I'm not saying I'm not the chump.
[3697.53s -> 3699.05s]  I'm just saying I'll go up against...
[3699.05s -> 3701.93s]  If you're 0-2, we're in the 0-2 chump class.
[3704.97s -> 3706.25s]  I don't really have any options.
[3715.50s -> 3717.66s]  I don't have any options.
[3728.44s -> 3729.96s]  Bottom right is the best option.
[3730.60s -> 3733.90s]  He's thinking.
[3734.46s -> 3735.58s]  He's thinking right now.
[3735.58s -> 3736.38s]  He's not sure what to do.
[3743.98s -> 3746.06s]  This thing has been here the whole game.
[3746.06s -> 3747.74s]  Well, I can't get rid of it.
[3747.74s -> 3749.42s]  I don't have any way to get rid of it.
[3754.02s -> 3758.26s]  Smart click doesn't work because people just click everywhere and it confuses me.
[3758.26s -> 3759.06s]  I'm still in this.
[3768.86s -> 3770.30s]  Oh, what a godsend.
[3772.60s -> 3774.76s]  Mad bomber weapons project.
[3786.38s -> 3786.94s]  Oh, fuck.
[3786.94s -> 3787.98s]  I can do this.
[3787.98s -> 3788.46s]  Whatever.
[3788.46s -> 3788.94s]  Don't matter.
[3793.29s -> 3794.09s]  God damn it.
[3794.65s -> 3799.10s]  I'm going to go 0-3 and then uninstall the game.
[3799.74s -> 3815.24s]  This is not a meltdown.
[3815.24s -> 3815.88s]  This is not...
[3815.88s -> 3816.68s]  What the fuck?
[3827.77s -> 3830.17s]  It's not a meltdown unless I say it is.
[3833.08s -> 3833.80s]  You know, let's just...
[3835.64s -> 3864.84s]  He's probably like, holy fuck, I didn't know he had that many.
[3864.84s -> 3866.52s]  This deck is not very good.
[3866.52s -> 3867.32s]  Look at this deck.
[3867.32s -> 3868.12s]  What is this deck?
[3869.77s -> 3872.09s]  I got three legendaries in the first game.
[3872.09s -> 3874.01s]  I haven't played this game in like four years.
[3874.01s -> 3876.41s]  Got three legendaries in the first game.
[3876.41s -> 3878.65s]  Second game, I made a little bit of an oops.
[3878.65s -> 3879.53s]  You know, I did it...
[3879.53s -> 3882.17s]  I accidentally did a little oops and then it cost me the game.
[3882.17s -> 3882.81s]  That's what happens.
[3883.69s -> 3909.90s]  All right, it's your guys' turn.
[3909.90s -> 3912.42s]  You got to pull me out of 0-3 here.
[3922.42s -> 3923.78s]  What happened to cooking simulator?
[3923.78s -> 3924.82s]  It's not out.
[3924.82s -> 3927.46s]  It releases tomorrow.
[3927.46s -> 3928.50s]  I got the date wrong.
[3930.70s -> 3935.67s]  So I was supposed to do that today.
[3936.31s -> 3939.45s]  Let's just dump everything here.
[3946.46s -> 3948.06s]  Add another oopsie to the pile.
[3948.78s -> 3950.22s]  All right, it's your turn.
[3950.22s -> 3951.90s]  Whatever the highest percentage is, is what I'm doing.
[3951.90s -> 3952.70s]  And you got to be quick.
[3952.70s -> 3954.22s]  And we have one turn for you to figure it out.
[3954.78s -> 3976.18s]  Okay, go.
[3976.18s -> 3977.38s]  Nice job.
[3977.38s -> 3978.42s]  Nice thinking.
[3978.42s -> 3994.30s]  Okay, go.
[3994.30s -> 4004.14s]  Why would you end turn again?
[4004.14s -> 4006.78s]  No, I'm not going to fucking end turn again.
[4006.78s -> 4012.10s]  Is that what you were clicking on?
[4012.10s -> 4013.46s]  I think that's what you were clicking on.
[4013.46s -> 4014.42s]  And then you want me to hit, right?
[4014.42s -> 4015.30s]  Yes, you do.
[4015.30s -> 4031.88s]  Funny man bad at card games.
[4035.90s -> 4036.70s]  It's just like...
[4036.70s -> 4038.54s]  It's just too much for me to have to do.
[4038.54s -> 4040.30s]  Like, I can't do this on stream.
[4040.30s -> 4041.18s]  I just can't.
[4043.22s -> 4046.34s]  When I sit there with my fucking mouth open in my bed,
[4046.34s -> 4046.98s]  it doesn't matter.
[4046.98s -> 4048.42s]  I just play whatever I'm going to play.
[4049.22s -> 4049.86s]  I can't.
[4049.86s -> 4050.50s]  I'm gonna.
[4050.50s -> 4051.46s]  The stream's not over.
[4053.96s -> 4054.60s]  You know what?
[4054.60s -> 4056.01s]  I'm doing this.
[4056.01s -> 4056.89s]  I'm doing this on my own.
[4056.89s -> 4057.37s]  I'm going to win.
[4058.74s -> 4059.70s]  I'm not going to look at the chat.
[4059.70s -> 4060.34s]  Are you ready for this?
[4060.90s -> 4069.91s]  I'm not going to look.
[4069.91s -> 4073.19s]  I know there's going to be people that have dissenting opinions.
[4073.19s -> 4074.79s]  Oh, I'm going to beat this.
[4074.79s -> 4075.91s]  Check this out.
[4075.91s -> 4083.99s]  I already got it.
[4083.99s -> 4084.63s]  I already know Flynn.
[4093.51s -> 4120.31s]  This is a fun game.
[4120.31s -> 4120.63s]  It is.
[4121.75s -> 4129.85s]  This is just a warm-up game.
[4129.85s -> 4130.91s]  All right.
[4174.18s -> 4175.75s]  I'm going to be quiet.
[4176.55s -> 4179.82s]  See, that's why I did that.
[4180.14s -> 4181.34s]  That's the reason why I did that.
[4181.34s -> 4184.22s]  Because now he had to kill that minion on this character.
[4184.22s -> 4185.02s]  That's why I did that.
[4185.66s -> 4186.78s]  I need to explain myself.
[4186.78s -> 4188.30s]  You guys know the fucking strategies.
[4208.33s -> 4210.89s]  But I have seven, seven, four.
[4219.83s -> 4220.55s]  No, I can't.
[4221.35s -> 4222.23s]  I hate doing this.
[4223.67s -> 4226.94s]  I fucking hate attacking and dying into nothing.
[4231.67s -> 4232.55s]  It's fine.
[4232.55s -> 4238.38s]  And then I can do.
[4239.26s -> 4239.74s]  All right.
[4239.74s -> 4240.70s]  I can take care of this.
[4240.70s -> 4244.60s]  See, make him do it.
[4244.60s -> 4251.13s]  This is bad.
[4251.13s -> 4251.85s]  This is not good.
[4259.72s -> 4261.08s]  Gain five armor draw.
[4261.08s -> 4268.31s]  I can draw, but this is not going to do anything.
[4270.33s -> 4271.85s]  Just drop every card.
[4274.79s -> 4276.31s]  Worst deck ever.
[4282.54s -> 4283.34s]  Oh, damn it.
[4283.34s -> 4284.14s]  I don't have a coin.
[4290.73s -> 4291.93s]  I don't want to put this down.
[4305.72s -> 4307.00s]  Just buy more packs.
[4307.56s -> 4316.44s]  Is this arena?
[4316.44s -> 4317.56s]  This is arena.
[4317.56s -> 4319.46s]  This is the first thing I'm playing.
[4320.50s -> 4324.26s]  After four years of not playing against another human being in this game,
[4324.26s -> 4328.34s]  I decided that I was going to play arena and have Twitch pick the cards
[4328.34s -> 4331.94s]  and they gave me fucking shitty cards on purpose for like a joke.
[4342.18s -> 4347.99s]  I'm going to go 0-3.
[4347.99s -> 4348.95s]  Fucking on stream.
[4348.95s -> 4349.83s]  I'm going to go 0-3.
[4355.32s -> 4356.12s]  I can't go 0-3.
[4356.12s -> 4356.92s]  I'm going to go 0-3.
[4356.92s -> 4357.40s]  No, I'm not.
[4368.66s -> 4369.30s]  It's not bad.
[4370.26s -> 4371.14s]  And then Berserker.
[4388.34s -> 4388.84s]  Damn it.
[4390.25s -> 4392.81s]  Right when I have an opportunity to like pull this back.
[4395.19s -> 4397.51s]  Does this deck just suck or am I like
[4398.31s -> 4401.27s]  the stupidest Hearthstone player on Twitch?
[4421.42s -> 4422.70s]  I can't go 0-3.
[4423.34s -> 4426.01s]  No, it can't start like this.
[4426.01s -> 4429.93s]  I'm just going to go play with the funny cards in single player mode.
[4446.50s -> 4447.54s]  Nothing even matters.
[4450.60s -> 4451.08s]  Whatever.
[4452.12s -> 4453.24s]  Thanks for the extra damage.
[4453.24s -> 4454.36s]  It's not going to do anything for me.
[4455.24s -> 4457.24s]  I don't even need to do that.
[4458.04s -> 4462.92s]  I'm just going to go to the funny cards after this.
[4473.74s -> 4475.74s]  I got like the extension for this.
[4476.30s -> 4477.91s]  Let's go.
[4479.34s -> 4484.06s]  No, it's because it's because we got bad calls.
[4484.06s -> 4485.98s]  We got bad draw from the arena choice.
[4495.67s -> 4497.03s]  We went to arena first.
[4497.03s -> 4498.95s]  Don't let the sour your opinion of me.
[4534.33s -> 4546.84s]  Nice.
[4546.84s -> 4553.78s]  Do you even get a key or do they send you like home?
[4553.78s -> 4556.90s]  Do they send you home with like a needs improvement?
[4556.90s -> 4559.22s]  Have your parents sign the report card?
[4559.22s -> 4560.57s]  Piece of paper.
[4575.22s -> 4577.22s]  Oh, I got a card pack out of that.
[4579.03s -> 4579.43s]  Nice.
[4579.99s -> 4584.58s]  Come on, give me something like pity legendaries.
[4590.07s -> 4591.19s]  Two rares.
[4591.19s -> 4599.75s]  Well, let's start with arena.
[4599.75s -> 4601.67s]  I shouldn't have started with arena.
[4601.67s -> 4603.75s]  Arena is like people are very good at it.
[4603.75s -> 4607.19s]  They play it and they one of those guys had the gold characters,
[4607.19s -> 4609.27s]  which means he has like 5,000 wins.
[4609.27s -> 4614.74s]  I didn't even look at the cards that I opened.
[4622.20s -> 4623.72s]  I played these are fun.
[4623.72s -> 4624.60s]  I've done these already.
[4628.30s -> 4631.42s]  I'm going to do the solo thing.
[4633.21s -> 4634.49s]  See, I've been doing this.
[4634.49s -> 4639.27s]  It's fun because this you don't have to pay cards.
[4639.27s -> 4640.55s]  They just do it for you.
[4641.27s -> 4643.45s]  It's great.
[4643.45s -> 4645.61s]  Heroic or I can't do heroic.
[4652.46s -> 4653.26s]  Heroic.
[4653.26s -> 4653.98s]  I can't do that.
[4663.29s -> 4663.93s]  Baby mode.
[4664.65s -> 4668.25s]  Let me just see if I have the confidence to be able to play this game.
[4668.25s -> 4669.69s]  I've already done it a bunch.
[4669.69s -> 4671.83s]  I'll let you pick this.
[4672.63s -> 4674.55s]  If you don't know what this is, it's a lot of fun.
[4674.55s -> 4674.95s]  Okay.
[4674.95s -> 4677.19s]  I started with arena and what a mistake that was.
[4677.19s -> 4679.51s]  Who should I play?
[4679.51s -> 4684.62s]  I got to build my confidence back up.
[4690.73s -> 4691.77s]  I hate fun.
[4696.68s -> 4699.96s]  Oh, also another funny little tidbit here of information.
[4700.76s -> 4707.35s]  You know how I said that cooking simulator launches tomorrow.
[4707.35s -> 4708.55s]  I thought it launched today.
[4709.50s -> 4715.13s]  Well, I was under the assumption that the new week was today,
[4716.38s -> 4722.25s]  but that's also apparently tomorrow too.
[4722.25s -> 4727.77s]  I thought this was going to be open today.
[4727.77s -> 4733.13s]  It's tomorrow.
[4733.13s -> 4734.17s]  Week four is tomorrow.
[4736.79s -> 4739.43s]  Yeah, fourth week of like the new part of the adventure.
[4739.67s -> 4741.85s]  We're going to do rogue.
[4745.94s -> 4749.24s]  Tomorrow at 10 a.m.
[4749.24s -> 4750.44s]  You're going to do an early stream.
[4752.78s -> 4754.62s]  No, I'm doing cooking simulator tomorrow.
[4754.62s -> 4760.57s]  Because I've fucking beaten 19 people.
[4761.80s -> 4763.56s]  See, I've done this.
[4763.56s -> 4764.84s]  This is my number.
[4764.84s -> 4768.66s]  All right, which one?
[4768.66s -> 4772.26s]  The dagger, the random card from another class,
[4772.26s -> 4773.94s]  or two damage to an undamaged minion.
[4776.68s -> 4777.88s]  You've only done 19.
[4778.84s -> 4779.96s]  Don't be mean to me.
[4779.96s -> 4780.92s]  I just play this in bed.
[4781.56s -> 4785.24s]  Okay, we'll do that one.
[4788.33s -> 4794.25s]  And which deck would you like to do?
[4794.25s -> 4795.37s]  We don't have to pick on this one.
[4796.73s -> 4805.75s]  Random, a random deck.
[4805.75s -> 4813.02s]  All right, that's the way it's going to be.
[4815.35s -> 4815.83s]  Let's go.
[4816.63s -> 4821.43s]  So it's kind of like a rogue-like.
[4821.43s -> 4823.43s]  You start at the beginning and you fight bosses.
[4823.43s -> 4824.95s]  It's eight bosses.
[4824.95s -> 4826.39s]  If they go down, you complete the run.
[4826.39s -> 4827.43s]  If you don't, if you lose,
[4827.43s -> 4828.79s]  you have to go back to the very beginning.
[4830.52s -> 4831.72s]  You get upgrades along the...
[4836.42s -> 4837.54s]  Fine, we'll just go.
[4845.30s -> 4847.14s]  For a second, I was about to play this,
[4847.22s -> 4849.54s]  but nobody can scream snipe me.
[4860.42s -> 4861.38s]  You know, okay, I'll give you...
[4863.22s -> 4864.98s]  If I was in bed right now, this would be...
[4864.98s -> 4865.78s]  I wouldn't even mind.
[4865.78s -> 4866.58s]  It doesn't matter.
[4866.58s -> 4867.14s]  I would just be like,
[4867.14s -> 4868.26s]  oh, I want to shoot this thing.
[4868.26s -> 4869.38s]  I want to play with this one.
[4870.10s -> 4878.17s]  There are 3,600 people in my bed and I don't like it.
[4878.17s -> 4882.01s]  You know, I feel like this is my bedtime thing.
[4886.39s -> 4888.71s]  All right, so every single
[4890.17s -> 4894.58s]  turn, we're going to do a, you know,
[4895.78s -> 4896.58s]  equivalent exchange.
[4896.58s -> 4898.50s]  Swap a random card in each player's hand.
[4898.50s -> 4899.62s]  This is just clown shit.
[4899.62s -> 4900.26s]  It doesn't matter.
[4900.26s -> 4901.06s]  So who cares?
[4908.15s -> 4910.15s]  See, like this is just clown shit.
[4910.15s -> 4911.03s]  It doesn't matter.
[4911.03s -> 4913.43s]  Nobody can like say it was a bad move
[4913.43s -> 4914.23s]  because like that was...
[4915.19s -> 4916.15s]  What am I supposed to do about that?
[4916.15s -> 4916.87s]  I can't stop that.
[4917.75s -> 4921.88s]  Draw a card that has Deathrattle cast.
[4921.88s -> 4922.60s]  This again.
[4922.60s -> 4924.52s]  I don't think I even have any Deathrattle cards.
[4924.52s -> 4925.48s]  Let's just steal something.
[4927.62s -> 4930.74s]  See, look, it's a total just dog shit mode.
[4931.75s -> 4932.71s]  I'm not supposed to have this.
[4933.43s -> 4941.29s]  Click the funny sound buttons.
[4941.29s -> 4941.53s]  Okay.
[4942.25s -> 4953.08s]  I don't have any Deathrattle cards.
[4953.08s -> 4953.40s]  We need to...
[4953.40s -> 4954.76s]  Okay, we need to pick Deathrattle cards
[4955.32s -> 4956.36s]  because they can't even attack.
[4957.00s -> 4959.27s]  I'm just gonna steal another card.
[4959.27s -> 4959.75s]  What does this do?
[4960.89s -> 4961.85s]  Four health to each hero.
[4964.63s -> 4966.71s]  I don't have any silences either.
[4968.23s -> 4969.18s]  Give me another one.
[4971.45s -> 4973.85s]  Give all dragons into our hand.
[4973.85s -> 4974.57s]  Three, three.
[4982.57s -> 4987.74s]  If I had a dragon, that'd be fucking incredible.
[4988.46s -> 4992.50s]  All right, let's get some board here.
[4993.14s -> 4995.72s]  Just to get it out there.
[4995.72s -> 4996.60s]  I mean, it can't attack
[4996.60s -> 4997.56s]  but the computer's stupid
[4997.56s -> 4999.24s]  so the computer will probably like attack it.
[5000.39s -> 5001.19s]  And there's the shark.
[5001.91s -> 5003.24s]  Eat a minion in your deck
[5003.24s -> 5004.28s]  and it gains its stats.
[5004.28s -> 5005.64s]  Add it to your hand if it dies.
[5012.95s -> 5015.59s]  Look, the computer is like as dumb as me.
[5017.91s -> 5023.80s]  Pack opening.
[5023.80s -> 5024.52s]  Waiting room.
[5025.80s -> 5028.18s]  All right, we got some cool here.
[5031.22s -> 5035.18s]  Uh, this deck is so bad.
[5035.82s -> 5036.94s]  Deal two damage.
[5036.94s -> 5038.94s]  Give your C'Thun to...
[5038.94s -> 5040.94s]  I don't even fucking have a C'Thun.
[5040.94s -> 5047.32s]  I think I should put out the...
[5047.96s -> 5049.16s]  Add a random potion to your hand.
[5051.66s -> 5053.02s]  Lethal, I can't attack with this.
[5059.93s -> 5061.93s]  Deal five damage to all characters.
[5061.93s -> 5064.07s]  Well, let's just do...
[5066.71s -> 5073.56s]  Minus three attack this turn.
[5075.37s -> 5076.17s]  I just did that.
[5080.09s -> 5081.13s]  All right, now we're gonna do shark.
[5085.43s -> 5086.63s]  Five damage to all characters.
[5086.63s -> 5087.35s]  No, I don't wanna do that.
[5088.46s -> 5090.30s]  Deal one damage to all other minions.
[5091.62s -> 5093.06s]  I mean, I think I'm gonna do shark.
[5097.11s -> 5097.91s]  No, let's do shark.
[5105.13s -> 5106.17s]  I don't have any more minions.
[5106.17s -> 5107.77s]  I only have one card.
[5114.52s -> 5116.02s]  Fucking God.
[5125.26s -> 5126.38s]  All right, it's time to win.
[5127.50s -> 5131.42s]  So that's five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[5133.30s -> 5133.86s]  I win.
[5137.43s -> 5139.19s]  I beat level one on normal.
[5148.18s -> 5149.85s]  Okay.
[5149.85s -> 5151.05s]  What treasure do you want me to pick?
[5151.05s -> 5154.01s]  Should I pick, like, give me advice?
[5155.69s -> 5156.81s]  Don't click that one.
[5158.01s -> 5159.45s]  That one is so stupid.
[5159.45s -> 5160.17s]  Don't do that.
[5164.31s -> 5166.15s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[5166.15s -> 5167.51s]  I'm gonna lose in the last...
[5167.51s -> 5168.79s]  If I get far enough.
[5174.09s -> 5175.61s]  Look at how good these other ones are.
[5179.80s -> 5180.68s]  All right, I need to...
[5180.68s -> 5181.56s]  What box?
[5181.56s -> 5183.16s]  What creature box am I gonna do?
[5191.10s -> 5191.66s]  I don't even...
[5191.66s -> 5192.14s]  What the hell?
[5192.14s -> 5192.54s]  What are we...
[5194.97s -> 5196.89s]  It's such a random amount of cards.
[5196.89s -> 5199.21s]  It actually just truly is random nonsense.
[5200.09s -> 5202.17s]  Cold blood three times.
[5202.81s -> 5212.09s]  These guys are just trying to give it a lose.
[5216.46s -> 5217.58s]  Four, I guess, like...
[5218.38s -> 5219.18s]  Four, eight...
[5220.38s -> 5224.74s]  Do you have a weapon?
[5224.74s -> 5225.86s]  I don't even think I have a weapon.
[5226.50s -> 5228.95s]  All right, coming up next is...
[5230.84s -> 5231.56s]  What?
[5231.56s -> 5241.43s]  We have to do...
[5241.43s -> 5242.55s]  We have to fight Wendy again.
[5249.69s -> 5250.19s]  Uh-huh.
[5254.41s -> 5256.01s]  This is the same thing?
[5256.01s -> 5256.41s]  It's the same...
[5260.09s -> 5260.65s]  Oh, no.
[5261.61s -> 5264.34s]  Uh, yeah.
[5264.34s -> 5265.46s]  Game one, one for each other.
[5265.46s -> 5266.02s]  Pirate yet?
[5266.02s -> 5267.54s]  Well, I don't have any other pirates.
[5271.30s -> 5273.14s]  Oh, Wendy stream sniped me.
[5274.02s -> 5276.55s]  All right, give helpful advice.
[5280.38s -> 5280.88s]  What?
[5283.99s -> 5285.27s]  Wait, why did I just get these?
[5285.27s -> 5286.15s]  That's not advice.
[5286.15s -> 5286.95s]  That's cheating.
[5298.44s -> 5299.64s]  Cheating is advice.
[5299.64s -> 5300.36s]  No, it's not.
[5300.36s -> 5301.40s]  How many of these do I...
[5301.40s -> 5303.00s]  I can't even play these.
[5307.64s -> 5309.56s]  I have to, like, get a fucking minion out here.
[5317.86s -> 5320.10s]  Well, I'll be able to do all kinds of fun stuff.
[5321.30s -> 5323.30s]  Divine Shield, draw a card.
[5326.90s -> 5330.74s]  I mean, should I just give him a fucking shitload?
[5331.38s -> 5333.06s]  I think I'm going to do Divine Shield,
[5334.28s -> 5338.18s]  or should I do Prep and then...
[5340.49s -> 5342.33s]  Prep double cold blood.
[5360.31s -> 5360.95s]  See, this is what...
[5360.95s -> 5361.35s]  This is...
[5361.35s -> 5361.99s]  I like this.
[5364.52s -> 5365.32s]  No pressure.
[5366.92s -> 5368.20s]  No stream snipers.
[5370.89s -> 5373.32s]  Um, I don't fucking have deathrattle.
[5373.32s -> 5374.20s]  Yes, I do, I guess.
[5378.30s -> 5379.58s]  Yeah, beat it.
[5379.58s -> 5386.09s]  Restore 12 health through a friendly character.
[5389.80s -> 5391.96s]  This is our town, Scruff.
[5391.96s -> 5393.00s]  Yeah, beat it.
[5393.96s -> 5394.52s]  I'm sure...
[5394.52s -> 5395.40s]  Okay, if you could...
[5395.40s -> 5396.68s]  If you could friendly fire,
[5396.68s -> 5398.12s]  I would have just killed myself.
[5400.33s -> 5401.13s]  Deal one day and hold...
[5401.13s -> 5401.77s]  Let me look at these.
[5403.29s -> 5406.38s]  Divine Shield, magnetic rush.
[5406.38s -> 5406.86s]  Let me see.
[5406.86s -> 5407.66s]  What do we got here?
[5425.48s -> 5426.76s]  Didn't even need anybody's help.
[5428.22s -> 5429.18s]  Yes, I'm a newbie.
[5429.18s -> 5429.58s]  I know that.
[5429.58s -> 5432.63s]  I'm aware of that.
[5432.63s -> 5433.91s]  I'm so fucking good.
[5436.68s -> 5437.56s]  All right, pick a box.
[5441.21s -> 5442.73s]  You're doing really good.
[5442.73s -> 5443.85s]  Carried by Khadgar.
[5443.85s -> 5444.33s]  That's fine.
[5446.14s -> 5447.10s]  More combo.
[5447.90s -> 5456.68s]  Deal two damage.
[5456.68s -> 5457.88s]  Summon a Jade Golem.
[5457.88s -> 5458.92s]  An evil miscrant.
[5458.92s -> 5460.28s]  Add two random lackeys.
[5461.00s -> 5461.32s]  All right.
[5462.12s -> 5462.92s]  Who's next?
[5467.75s -> 5468.95s]  Soothe saver Zoe.
[5468.95s -> 5469.67s]  At the start of your turn,
[5469.67s -> 5471.75s]  restore two health to all friendly minions.
[5473.35s -> 5475.03s]  That's fucking insane.
[5476.26s -> 5478.02s]  How are we ever going to be able to beat this?
[5478.90s -> 5488.22s]  Did you just mute Dr. Boom?
[5488.22s -> 5489.26s]  That's not Dr. Boom.
[5500.31s -> 5501.03s]  All right, I want...
[5502.47s -> 5503.27s]  I mean, that's...
[5503.27s -> 5504.47s]  Two damage is two damage.
[5505.11s -> 5506.87s]  By the way, if you're curious,
[5506.87s -> 5509.75s]  everybody's attack and health have swapped.
[5509.75s -> 5510.79s]  You probably already knew that.
[5514.10s -> 5514.74s]  Let me keep this.
[5521.34s -> 5521.98s]  All right, Khadgar.
[5521.98s -> 5523.10s]  Give me some more free shit.
[5528.06s -> 5529.34s]  Is there any circumstance
[5529.34s -> 5535.99s]  where you would ever play this card?
[5535.99s -> 5537.03s]  Yes, there is.
[5537.03s -> 5539.11s]  What the fuck is the scenario?
[5540.71s -> 5542.31s]  Draw the rest of your deck.
[5543.11s -> 5545.83s]  Let me adjust the cost of that for you.
[5545.83s -> 5549.98s]  I mean, that didn't really help, but thanks.
[5556.50s -> 5558.74s]  Silver hand recruit you control.
[5561.19s -> 5564.20s]  If you have an empty hand and 10 cards left.
[5564.20s -> 5564.84s]  Yeah, I guess.
[5565.64s -> 5567.32s]  I guess it is just a huge draw,
[5567.32s -> 5571.13s]  but so many crazy things that they've added.
[5572.09s -> 5575.05s]  Well, here's the two damage.
[5585.10s -> 5586.06s]  Causes zero.
[5586.06s -> 5587.02s]  Okay, what do we got?
[5587.02s -> 5587.98s]  I got some damage here.
[5589.50s -> 5590.46s]  Deal two damage.
[5591.75s -> 5593.43s]  Oh, no, I can't do that.
[5594.07s -> 5595.05s]  I could do...
[5595.77s -> 5598.28s]  I could do this.
[5598.28s -> 5598.68s]  I could do...
[5599.40s -> 5600.20s]  What's more important?
[5600.76s -> 5604.44s]  Oh, I don't know.
[5604.44s -> 5605.16s]  What's more important?
[5605.72s -> 5606.92s]  This is all combos.
[5609.99s -> 5616.31s]  Two damage into bandit into hit or two damage into...
[5629.80s -> 5630.36s]  That works.
[5633.96s -> 5635.96s]  One into two into three into one into two.
[5635.96s -> 5637.32s]  How many fingers do you see?
[5640.38s -> 5644.57s]  Oh, I hate combo cards.
[5645.69s -> 5646.49s]  Because I like...
[5647.21s -> 5647.85s]  It's too many...
[5647.85s -> 5649.21s]  It's too many problems to deal with.
[5649.21s -> 5650.41s]  It's too many, like, chains.
[5651.29s -> 5654.04s]  All right, so that's two, three, four.
[5655.22s -> 5658.42s]  Or we could do two and then three.
[5660.02s -> 5661.74s]  It could be you.
[5661.74s -> 5662.46s]  It's going to be you.
[5663.88s -> 5665.40s]  I'm not going to draw my whole deck.
[5667.51s -> 5668.31s]  Here's what we're going to do.
[5669.32s -> 5669.82s]  You ready?
[5684.79s -> 5690.07s]  Add a toxin to your hand.
[5690.07s -> 5690.57s]  Nice.
[5696.76s -> 5697.88s]  Plus one attack and rush.
[5698.28s -> 5699.24s]  Discover a spell.
[5700.68s -> 5704.26s]  Now you draw a card and then...
[5705.06s -> 5709.54s]  I got three draw.
[5709.54s -> 5711.06s]  I'm not going to draw the rest of the deck.
[5712.17s -> 5713.21s]  That's going to kill me.
[5714.01s -> 5715.77s]  I'm going to start taking fatigue damage.
[5718.71s -> 5719.67s]  One attack, let's say it will be...
[5722.82s -> 5723.78s]  Here's what I'm going to do.
[5760.33s -> 5761.13s]  Oh, that's nice.
[5764.87s -> 5766.23s]  You shouldn't have cleared.
[5766.23s -> 5767.03s]  Well, that was scary.
[5767.99s -> 5768.63s]  Okay, now he's...
[5768.63s -> 5769.83s]  Look, what are you going to do?
[5772.12s -> 5774.33s]  This is...
[5774.33s -> 5775.13s]  I can take care of this.
[5777.69s -> 5783.82s]  Set the attack of all minions to one.
[5783.82s -> 5784.54s]  Preparation.
[5785.43s -> 5786.23s]  Find shield.
[5786.95s -> 5787.67s]  Let's see.
[5789.61s -> 5791.45s]  So everyone has one attack.
[5791.45s -> 5792.25s]  And that's not going to help.
[5795.03s -> 5796.79s]  Prep and draw the deck.
[5800.31s -> 5800.95s]  Are you happy?
[5801.85s -> 5802.41s]  Are you happy?
[5803.05s -> 5806.87s]  Do I have lethal?
[5809.93s -> 5811.88s]  Hold on.
[5811.88s -> 5814.57s]  That's four, eight.
[5817.26s -> 5818.22s]  Cold blood.
[5824.70s -> 5825.50s]  So let me see.
[5825.50s -> 5825.82s]  Hold on.
[5825.82s -> 5827.66s]  Two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[5828.38s -> 5830.46s]  Do I have lethal?
[5831.02s -> 5835.45s]  Eight, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty...
[5835.45s -> 5836.01s]  I got lethal.
[5843.59s -> 5845.43s]  Holy shit, a ton of subs just came in.
[5845.43s -> 5846.39s]  I don't have lethal!
[5847.03s -> 5851.83s]  Why did I just think I had lethal?
[5857.61s -> 5859.85s]  Why did somebody tell me I had lethal?
[5859.85s -> 5861.45s]  I'm not supposed to be looking at the chat room.
[5866.18s -> 5867.22s]  Oh, god damn it.
[5867.22s -> 5868.02s]  It's all right, I'm going to win.
[5868.66s -> 5871.62s]  Uh, twenty community subs just came in.
[5873.48s -> 5875.48s]  Thank you for the twenty community subs.
[5875.48s -> 5877.16s]  Great Canadian fuck club.
[5878.78s -> 5879.50s]  Thank you so much.
[5884.15s -> 5884.71s]  Oh, no.
[5889.21s -> 5890.01s]  Oh, this is perfect.
[5908.71s -> 5910.26s]  What are you gonna do about that?
[5910.98s -> 5921.27s]  Ow!
[5933.82s -> 5935.90s]  Big brain, big brain, big brain.
[5945.70s -> 5948.04s]  Oh, nice card you got.
[5948.60s -> 5954.52s]  I've never played this game before.
[5954.52s -> 5955.88s]  I have no idea what the fuck is happening.
[5958.31s -> 5961.27s]  Well, I can probably join that boat with you.
[5961.27s -> 5964.47s]  But anyways, the great Canadian brick club Cersei gave.
[5964.47s -> 5965.27s]  That's a lot of money.
[5965.27s -> 5967.27s]  Thank you for the twenty community subs.
[5967.27s -> 5972.63s]  There was also fifty dollars earlier from Toxray.
[5972.63s -> 5974.79s]  Thank you for the fifty fucking dollars.
[5975.59s -> 5978.31s]  And they said, play against Stirr at least once.
[5978.31s -> 5979.91s]  No, he plays this game all the time.
[5979.91s -> 5980.63s]  That would be a mistake.
[5981.35s -> 5982.07s]  Which one?
[5985.30s -> 5991.06s]  Master Scheme Super Simeon Sphere and Flyby.
[5996.28s -> 5998.68s]  Shuffle a Kaboom bot into your opponent's deck when joined.
[5998.68s -> 5999.56s]  It explodes for a fit.
[5999.56s -> 6001.00s]  So you just instantly kill somebody.
[6008.15s -> 6009.91s]  If they draw that, you just win.
[6009.91s -> 6013.40s]  That seems, I mean, that seems pretty cool.
[6015.94s -> 6016.50s]  This is cool.
[6016.50s -> 6017.30s]  Summon King Moogle.
[6017.30s -> 6019.70s]  I give it immune and can't be targeted by spells and hero powers.
[6022.14s -> 6026.46s]  Seems like the indecisive some of you guys.
[6030.66s -> 6035.43s]  But gonna have to click on the one that has the most votes.
[6042.57s -> 6043.29s]  What just happened?
[6044.62s -> 6045.58s]  Oh, God damn it.
[6045.58s -> 6046.70s]  We have to do this again.
[6046.70s -> 6048.54s]  For some reason, it reset itself.
[6049.98s -> 6051.74s]  Anybody could click it an infinite amount of times.
[6051.74s -> 6052.46s]  You ready?
[6052.46s -> 6053.42s]  Here it comes.
[6053.42s -> 6060.60s]  This one's for real.
[6060.60s -> 6063.32s]  I looked over, there was like ten thousand clicks.
[6063.32s -> 6075.69s]  People were just like, maybe I'll press that.
[6075.69s -> 6077.67s]  Maybe I'll press this one.
[6078.79s -> 6082.55s]  Super Simeon Sphere is looks like it's gonna win.
[6082.55s -> 6092.18s]  That is the one you get.
[6092.18s -> 6093.14s]  Don't worry, don't go anywhere.
[6093.14s -> 6093.86s]  You get to pick again.
[6105.88s -> 6107.88s]  I don't want more combo card.
[6108.52s -> 6116.95s]  There's like a legendary over here.
[6116.95s -> 6129.30s]  How many cold bloods am I gonna have?
[6129.30s -> 6130.02s]  All right.
[6130.02s -> 6134.66s]  Eviscerate, cold blood, and then Vile Spine slowly destroy a minion for combo.
[6134.66s -> 6135.54s]  I guess we can take it.
[6139.35s -> 6140.47s]  Oh, this is this thing, right?
[6141.27s -> 6143.21s]  So this is a friendly encounter.
[6143.21s -> 6145.45s]  We get to pick something or change something.
[6145.45s -> 6146.41s]  You guys can pick this too.
[6154.26s -> 6155.54s]  You get to modify the deck.
[6156.10s -> 6156.50s]  Let's see.
[6163.83s -> 6164.63s]  All right.
[6164.63s -> 6172.46s]  So we got the shark, the Disciple of C'thun, the skater bot, and the Vile Spine.
[6172.46s -> 6175.54s]  And then these up here.
[6175.54s -> 6179.78s]  Lotus Agents, Malygos, and Lower Walker Cho.
[6179.78s -> 6183.98s]  Choose a friendly minion that always starts in your hand.
[6183.98s -> 6186.22s]  So I can get one of these to always be in the hand.
[6186.22s -> 6188.06s]  Discover a legendary and add it to the deck.
[6188.62s -> 6193.98s]  Or look at four spells from your deck and reduce the cost by one of their cost by three for the whole run.
[6193.98s -> 6203.19s]  Always have the shark or all add everybody and give them all one one.
[6203.19s -> 6207.78s]  Which one do you want me to do?
[6207.78s -> 6209.62s]  I can do two of these.
[6209.62s -> 6210.82s]  Well, the ones that cost.
[6213.13s -> 6214.89s]  I don't think this is going to work without a zoom in.
[6215.85s -> 6222.34s]  Yeah, I don't think this is going to work without me zooming in.
[6223.88s -> 6225.00s]  Hold on just a second here.
[6235.85s -> 6236.41s]  Try it again.
[6246.36s -> 6257.48s]  Add all or choose a friendly minion and remove it from the deck.
[6257.48s -> 6258.60s]  Looks like we're going to do this one.
[6260.42s -> 6264.26s]  Add all these enemy minions and give them all plus one plus one.
[6264.26s -> 6269.21s]  Here we go.
[6274.23s -> 6274.55s]  Okay.
[6278.47s -> 6283.16s]  Now what?
[6283.16s -> 6283.96s]  What should I do now?
[6284.60s -> 6292.78s]  Discover a legendary.
[6292.78s -> 6295.08s]  People want me to get rid of...
[6295.08s -> 6296.36s]  What do you want me to get rid of?
[6301.21s -> 6302.25s]  Let's discover a legendary.
[6302.25s -> 6303.53s]  I mean, everyone's going to want me to do that.
[6303.53s -> 6303.93s]  Of course.
[6304.98s -> 6305.30s]  Why?
[6305.30s -> 6306.50s]  You know, why the heck not?
[6306.50s -> 6308.50s]  Well, you can't go wrong with that one.
[6308.50s -> 6309.46s]  They're a regular.
[6309.46s -> 6310.15s]  Okay.
[6310.15s -> 6311.67s]  Let's zoom out for a second.
[6316.33s -> 6317.29s]  Can you zoom out, please?
[6322.97s -> 6326.17s]  Tack, gnaws, whisker, ysera, or mogre the ogre.
[6331.99s -> 6333.83s]  Mogre the ogre is terrible.
[6340.70s -> 6342.46s]  Nobody wants tack.
[6347.26s -> 6348.22s]  Not one person.
[6348.22s -> 6349.74s]  All right, ysera.
[6351.50s -> 6354.30s]  Anything else you guys would like me to do or is time to end?
[6354.30s -> 6358.81s]  Remember, if you click down there,
[6358.81s -> 6366.68s]  there's only one thing I can do.
[6366.68s -> 6367.40s]  Dismiss.
[6367.40s -> 6368.44s]  All right.
[6368.44s -> 6368.92s]  Dismiss?
[6369.72s -> 6371.98s]  Who would you like me to dismiss?
[6371.98s -> 6378.74s]  Thank you, Dora.
[6378.74s -> 6379.54s]  Oh, fuck.
[6379.54s -> 6381.59s]  Hold on.
[6381.59s -> 6382.07s]  Hold on.
[6382.07s -> 6382.39s]  No.
[6382.39s -> 6382.87s]  Oops.
[6383.59s -> 6400.22s]  Do it again.
[6400.22s -> 6401.34s]  Skaterbot.
[6401.34s -> 6402.78s]  Disciple Cthulhu and the shark.
[6402.78s -> 6403.66s]  Dismiss the shark.
[6405.70s -> 6406.42s]  Skaterbot.
[6406.42s -> 6406.82s]  Okay.
[6406.82s -> 6407.54s]  Interesting choice.
[6407.54s -> 6408.50s]  Interesting choice.
[6409.06s -> 6410.26s]  I'm not sure I would have done that.
[6410.26s -> 6413.18s]  Get him out of here.
[6413.18s -> 6415.16s]  Let's go.
[6415.16s -> 6421.45s]  That's what you say, Jerma.
[6421.45s -> 6423.05s]  That's why you're chicken league.
[6423.05s -> 6427.22s]  But you can't stay here.
[6427.94s -> 6429.38s]  Because you suck.
[6430.02s -> 6431.21s]  But it's still fun.
[6433.48s -> 6435.48s]  Okay, so this lady.
[6435.48s -> 6438.44s]  Both players summon a minion from their deck and they fight.
[6439.00s -> 6440.81s]  Pretty cool.
[6441.45s -> 6447.16s]  Why are we trying to win?
[6449.94s -> 6451.62s]  I don't know, because sometimes winning is fun.
[6457.66s -> 6459.18s]  I do have both of those dragons.
[6460.94s -> 6462.78s]  13-5 because they're swapped.
[6463.50s -> 6465.26s]  You can't hold them, ysera.
[6467.18s -> 6467.98s]  No, that's not how it goes.
[6467.98s -> 6469.74s]  You can't hold on to a nine cost.
[6469.74s -> 6471.10s]  You gotta get somebody in here.
[6473.82s -> 6474.30s]  No, I can't.
[6474.30s -> 6475.50s]  I gotta get rid of...
[6475.50s -> 6476.78s]  No, I can't do that.
[6476.78s -> 6477.58s]  Not this early.
[6478.46s -> 6479.58s]  I need, like, a minion.
[6483.45s -> 6484.49s]  Hold it or die.
[6485.45s -> 6486.01s]  Wow.
[6486.01s -> 6486.73s]  That was...
[6486.73s -> 6487.29s]  There we go.
[6487.29s -> 6487.93s]  There's Cho.
[6489.24s -> 6498.41s]  Immediately play Cho.
[6498.41s -> 6500.81s]  A 5-1 Lorewalker Cho.
[6502.92s -> 6504.28s]  Thank god I did the 1-1.
[6504.28s -> 6505.48s]  Otherwise he would just be dead.
[6505.48s -> 6506.36s]  He wouldn't be able to play him.
[6512.25s -> 6513.82s]  Perfect.
[6513.82s -> 6514.22s]  Let's go.
[6515.82s -> 6521.86s]  I'll take it.
[6531.06s -> 6532.42s]  He's immediately dead.
[6534.07s -> 6534.71s]  Okay.
[6534.71s -> 6536.87s]  So, um, I could do that to him.
[6541.64s -> 6542.36s]  Or I could do...
[6543.24s -> 6548.47s]  Maybe I should just put out...
[6548.47s -> 6548.71s]  No.
[6549.35s -> 6552.57s]  Just combo, eviscerate.
[6554.58s -> 6555.14s]  I could just...
[6556.02s -> 6556.66s]  Yeah, I could.
[6557.46s -> 6560.89s]  Yeah, fuck it.
[6560.89s -> 6561.13s]  Wait.
[6562.18s -> 6562.42s]  Yeah.
[6563.06s -> 6565.69s]  Check this out.
[6566.25s -> 6578.15s]  What the hell was that?
[6582.23s -> 6583.03s]  What just happened?
[6584.76s -> 6586.04s]  She played her thing in two...
[6586.04s -> 6586.28s]  Okay.
[6587.34s -> 6590.14s]  Oh, deal three damage to all minions is the thing that plays.
[6590.78s -> 6593.02s]  Okay, that was all over the place.
[6593.02s -> 6593.34s]  All right.
[6593.34s -> 6594.06s]  Let's go with...
[6602.47s -> 6605.18s]  I'm just gonna steal and then put out this monkey.
[6611.90s -> 6612.46s]  That's...
[6612.46s -> 6613.26s]  I can handle that.
[6613.26s -> 6613.58s]  Don't worry.
[6617.58s -> 6618.22s]  Two damage.
[6618.22s -> 6618.46s]  Oh.
[6636.07s -> 6636.87s]  Holy shit.
[6640.46s -> 6641.26s]  Are you serious?
[6643.80s -> 6644.12s]  Wow.
[6646.09s -> 6647.13s]  All right.
[6647.13s -> 6647.61s]  Hold on.
[6648.41s -> 6650.28s]  That's a lot of damage.
[6653.98s -> 6655.66s]  Go for face or do I...
[6656.46s -> 6657.54s]  Let me see.
[6657.54s -> 6657.86s]  Hold on.
[6664.23s -> 6666.12s]  Deal two damage to a friendly character.
[6666.12s -> 6667.40s]  Discover a demon.
[6667.40s -> 6669.42s]  Let's get this out here.
[6679.78s -> 6681.06s]  Oh, you're screwed.
[6681.62s -> 6682.90s]  I'm gonna make you draw your whole deck.
[6686.84s -> 6687.93s]  I think I have lethal.
[6688.97s -> 6691.75s]  Yeah, I do.
[6691.75s -> 6692.47s]  Three.
[6692.47s -> 6693.19s]  Yeah, I got lethal.
[6714.90s -> 6716.18s]  It's just fun to do this.
[6721.64s -> 6722.20s]  I'm V...
[6722.20s -> 6723.00s]  I am V-aiming.
[6723.00s -> 6723.40s]  That's fine.
[6727.83s -> 6728.71s]  Pretty good.
[6728.71s -> 6729.19s]  In there.
[6730.23s -> 6731.51s]  See, aren't you guys having fun?
[6732.31s -> 6734.15s]  It's fun just to play these little games.
[6739.46s -> 6740.18s]  Who says no?
[6743.86s -> 6744.42s]  Remove them.
[6754.90s -> 6756.81s]  Oh, what do you think?
[6756.81s -> 6758.73s]  Should I get two more eviscerates?
[6758.73s -> 6764.52s]  There are too many to ban.
[6764.52s -> 6765.32s]  They're rising up.
[6765.88s -> 6766.84s]  It's the mutiny.
[6766.84s -> 6767.56s]  It's this stream.
[6771.34s -> 6772.46s]  That's a lot of vanquish.
[6773.02s -> 6777.37s]  And we get a Sneeds too.
[6777.37s -> 6778.09s]  That's pretty good.
[6778.81s -> 6779.29s]  I agree.
[6786.66s -> 6787.94s]  Uh, passive hero power.
[6787.94s -> 6791.94s]  You choose one cards and powers have both effects combined.
[6792.50s -> 6800.31s]  What's going on here?
[6805.18s -> 6815.35s]  So how much more difficult is heroic from here?
[6824.78s -> 6826.54s]  It's really, really hard, right?
[6827.34s -> 6829.06s]  I don't think I can handle that.
[6838.70s -> 6839.82s]  It's baby mode.
[6839.82s -> 6842.14s]  Heroic is very easy and much harder than this.
[6849.62s -> 6850.74s]  What does that mean?
[6850.74s -> 6850.98s]  What?
[6852.73s -> 6855.13s]  Uh, let's just get a minion out.
[6861.59s -> 6861.91s]  No!
[6863.03s -> 6865.85s]  May as well just concede.
[6868.98s -> 6870.18s]  It's like you were saying last night.
[6870.18s -> 6872.82s]  This is baby mode Captain Crunch Hearthstone.
[6874.10s -> 6874.98s]  But that's all right.
[6875.70s -> 6877.00s]  There's nothing wrong with that.
[6878.81s -> 6880.41s]  Um, I think I have to just get rid of this.
[6894.95s -> 6897.19s]  Preparation into...
[6897.19s -> 6898.31s]  Oh, yeah.
[6898.31s -> 6900.15s]  Preparation into Jade Shuriken.
[6904.89s -> 6906.17s]  Preparation draw deck.
[6906.17s -> 6917.30s]  I'm not doing that.
[6917.30s -> 6918.26s]  I couldn't even do that.
[6924.54s -> 6928.25s]  Ooh, okay, hold on.
[6928.25s -> 6931.59s]  No, nope, nope.
[6931.59s -> 6933.67s]  Um, no.
[6934.63s -> 6937.34s]  Corrupt every minion.
[6937.34s -> 6939.18s]  Destroy them at the start of your next turn.
[6939.18s -> 6949.38s]  Oh, I can't.
[6949.38s -> 6950.34s]  Why would I do that right now?
[6951.14s -> 6953.98s]  Destroy them at the start of my next turn.
[6955.75s -> 6956.63s]  That is really good.
[6968.47s -> 6969.67s]  See, now I would use it.
[6970.39s -> 6971.43s]  Because that thing's stealth.
[6972.23s -> 6974.42s]  Click the towers.
[6975.06s -> 6982.95s]  Oh, Futurama theme.
[6982.95s -> 6983.27s]  Nice.
[6984.94s -> 6986.70s]  Okay, uh, I'm gonna do this.
[6987.42s -> 6988.46s]  And then I'm gonna put out...
[6989.18s -> 6992.07s]  I don't know, maybe I shouldn't do that.
[6992.07s -> 6994.39s]  Is the Earth Mother listening?
[6994.39s -> 6994.71s]  Yeah.
[6997.83s -> 6998.31s]  Where's the...
[6999.83s -> 7002.92s]  He's just gonna end up killing it.
[7003.48s -> 7007.08s]  Let's just get the fucking shark out here.
[7011.64s -> 7012.12s]  Pretty good.
[7024.58s -> 7025.22s]  He's not...
[7025.22s -> 7027.14s]  Okay, just going for face?
[7027.14s -> 7027.86s]  What's up with that?
[7031.99s -> 7035.00s]  Well, now that changes things.
[7040.18s -> 7040.74s]  Kill this.
[7041.86s -> 7042.34s]  And then...
[7042.98s -> 7044.02s]  I don't want to corrupt though.
[7049.05s -> 7050.33s]  Oh my god, yes.
[7051.88s -> 7052.36s]  Thank you.
[7053.16s -> 7053.88s]  Appreciate it.
[7081.05s -> 7081.29s]  What?
[7081.93s -> 7082.17s]  What?
[7085.29s -> 7086.81s]  Oh, the death rattle.
[7086.81s -> 7087.45s]  Oh, fuck.
[7088.25s -> 7091.14s]  It's all right.
[7091.14s -> 7093.06s]  I get plenty of good cards.
[7093.06s -> 7096.02s]  All right, we got one.
[7096.02s -> 7097.06s]  Uh, I can just...
[7097.06s -> 7097.54s]  Hold on.
[7097.54s -> 7098.58s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[7098.58s -> 7100.26s]  Summoner Empt two cost minion.
[7101.40s -> 7101.96s]  Combo.
[7103.00s -> 7105.26s]  Could do a couple combos here.
[7105.98s -> 7110.04s]  I don't think this is not lethal.
[7112.92s -> 7114.52s]  Six, ten, eleven.
[7117.61s -> 7119.93s]  Twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen.
[7119.93s -> 7120.81s]  That is nineteen.
[7121.53s -> 7125.93s]  Or eighteen.
[7125.93s -> 7127.86s]  I'm just gonna do this.
[7148.86s -> 7149.26s]  Damn.
[7149.26s -> 7150.22s]  I wish I could do that.
[7159.38s -> 7160.50s]  I'm gonna spread it out.
[7160.50s -> 7161.46s]  I'm gonna spread it out a little.
[7193.40s -> 7193.80s]  Fuck.
[7193.80s -> 7194.52s]  Why did I do that?
[7199.66s -> 7201.18s]  I can do one damage to somebody, right?
[7202.04s -> 7203.24s]  One damage to all of the minions.
[7203.80s -> 7207.10s]  All right, get out there, you motherfucker.
[7213.58s -> 7215.02s]  And I can do bang.
[7217.90s -> 7219.02s]  Freeze this idiot.
[7233.29s -> 7234.49s]  What a huge play.
[7235.61s -> 7237.03s]  Pretty standard.
[7241.99s -> 7243.11s]  I think he's dead this turn, right?
[7243.83s -> 7248.15s]  You're just gonna heal over and over again?
[7248.15s -> 7248.63s]  Never mind.
[7251.32s -> 7252.12s]  All right, hold on.
[7252.12s -> 7252.44s]  I'm...
[7252.44s -> 7253.08s]  Hold on a minute.
[7254.62s -> 7255.34s]  I think I have it.
[7255.34s -> 7256.14s]  Six, eight...
[7256.14s -> 7256.62s]  No, I got it.
[7256.62s -> 7256.94s]  I got it.
[7257.66s -> 7259.34s]  I need to do this correct.
[7259.34s -> 7261.58s]  Six, twelve, eighteen, nineteen, twenty.
[7262.46s -> 7264.14s]  Twenty-one, twenty, two.
[7265.02s -> 7265.66s]  I need to...
[7265.66s -> 7265.90s]  Yeah.
[7278.18s -> 7281.66s]  He doesn't know?
[7281.66s -> 7282.14s]  I saw it.
[7286.23s -> 7287.67s]  It's not BM if you're against the computer.
[7287.67s -> 7288.87s]  The computer doesn't have any feelings.
[7289.51s -> 7295.93s]  The computer does not have feelings.
[7295.93s -> 7298.23s]  It's mathematical code.
[7298.79s -> 7307.38s]  All right, what do we want?
[7307.38s -> 7308.58s]  You hurt my feelings.
[7309.14s -> 7312.04s]  You have permanent stealth.
[7314.41s -> 7317.21s]  At the start of your turn, give a random minion a hand plus one plus one,
[7317.21s -> 7319.05s]  or you start with an extra mana crystal.
[7319.05s -> 7320.97s]  That one's good, but boring.
[7321.61s -> 7326.63s]  This one seems broken.
[7327.27s -> 7331.61s]  I think that's what we're doing.
[7332.17s -> 7335.80s]  You minions have permanent stealth.
[7337.27s -> 7337.83s]  What?
[7337.83s -> 7338.81s]  Creature box.
[7339.37s -> 7348.49s]  And I'm the number three Hearthstone streamer?
[7351.82s -> 7356.14s]  Well, I really might put a disclaimer up that I'm not very good.
[7356.14s -> 7357.26s]  I'm just having fun.
[7358.14s -> 7363.14s]  Two of Thoris?
[7363.14s -> 7364.90s]  That makes three Vancleeps.
[7365.46s -> 7367.58s]  The title already explains it.
[7367.58s -> 7368.38s]  Yeah, I guess it does.
[7369.02s -> 7375.78s]  I remember when Emperor Thoris seemed unbearable.
[7378.02s -> 7379.66s]  He was so good.
[7384.92s -> 7386.36s]  Is he still in every single deck?
[7396.78s -> 7397.50s]  Okay, what do we got?
[7398.54s -> 7399.98s]  Always starts in your hand.
[7399.98s -> 7401.90s]  I could do Vancleef to always start.
[7402.46s -> 7405.82s]  Reduce the cost of a random card in your deck to zero.
[7410.66s -> 7412.90s]  Oh my god, what the hell is this?
[7413.62s -> 7416.15s]  2020?
[7418.26s -> 7419.22s]  Starts dormant.
[7419.22s -> 7419.78s]  Battle cry.
[7419.78s -> 7422.42s]  Shuffle three candles into the enemy deck when drawn.
[7422.42s -> 7423.38s]  This awakens.
[7429.38s -> 7429.62s]  What?
[7432.02s -> 7436.36s]  Okay, so that's insane.
[7437.61s -> 7438.89s]  It never happens.
[7438.89s -> 7441.05s]  Four mana, zero, zero.
[7443.83s -> 7445.59s]  Yeah, you just spend four mana.
[7446.33s -> 7448.81s]  It's just a coin that doesn't do anything, but it's four.
[7451.50s -> 7455.22s]  All right, well, you know what to do.
[7471.19s -> 7472.63s]  You're all fired.
[7472.63s -> 7479.06s]  Is that what you guys are clicking on?
[7479.06s -> 7479.38s]  Is that?
[7479.38s -> 7479.78s]  No.
[7479.78s -> 7480.10s]  Is it?
[7480.10s -> 7480.50s]  It is.
[7481.06s -> 7484.14s]  Don't you know we want a bunch of Vancleefs?
[7487.32s -> 7489.99s]  We need to, we might need to enhance this again.
[7495.86s -> 7497.14s]  Yeah, I need to enhance it again.
[7498.10s -> 7508.07s]  Go for it.
[7508.07s -> 7509.75s]  Okay, I was about to throw everybody away.
[7511.26s -> 7516.33s]  All right, so we're going to take them all into the enemy deck.
[7516.33s -> 7517.77s]  All right, yeah, let's go for it.
[7517.77s -> 7518.41s]  Take everybody.
[7521.98s -> 7522.78s]  All right, now what?
[7523.58s -> 7526.81s]  That thing's really interesting though.
[7526.81s -> 7534.18s]  Four mana, zero, zero.
[7535.11s -> 7535.91s]  Unfortunately.
[7541.26s -> 7542.30s]  All right, that's that one.
[7547.34s -> 7548.46s]  Okay, let's see what it is.
[7549.98s -> 7556.30s]  The thing that we just got.
[7559.14s -> 7560.34s]  All right, are we good?
[7560.90s -> 7565.59s]  That was four mana, right?
[7570.39s -> 7570.95s]  That's not bad.
[7578.60s -> 7579.24s]  All right, let's go.
[7582.02s -> 7582.50s]  Here we go.
[7583.06s -> 7584.58s]  I'm fucking excited.
[7584.58s -> 7588.82s]  Is anybody else like just absolutely boiling with excitement right now?
[7588.82s -> 7593.99s]  And if you're not, then that's pretty normal.
[7596.01s -> 7599.21s]  Okay, so I'm going to 2-2 Treant with Taunt.
[7599.85s -> 7606.79s]  Is that two mana?
[7607.35s -> 7615.21s]  This boss is overpowered.
[7623.19s -> 7624.63s]  Oh, fuck yeah.
[7624.63s -> 7627.35s]  Guaranteed win right here is zero, four, five.
[7627.35s -> 7629.27s]  Deal two damage to all undamaged enemy minions.
[7630.23s -> 7630.95s]  Instantly going to win.
[7638.36s -> 7639.56s]  Only hard and heroic.
[7645.19s -> 7646.23s]  Save it for clear.
[7647.69s -> 7650.25s]  But it's so easy just to throw them out there right now.
[7650.25s -> 7651.61s]  But zero mana.
[7653.34s -> 7655.34s]  Okay, I will hold off.
[7659.05s -> 7666.54s]  Okay, steal or draw Deathrattle?
[7667.10s -> 7678.76s]  I went with my gut.
[7678.76s -> 7679.64s]  That was the wrong idea.
[7680.36s -> 7684.98s]  Okay, now I'm going to have to play this.
[7685.62s -> 7687.94s]  Oh shit, this is bad.
[7693.13s -> 7693.69s]  Not yet.
[7694.89s -> 7695.77s]  It's killing me.
[7696.79s -> 7699.91s]  Oh, not yet, but they're getting this too many on the board.
[7706.39s -> 7708.79s]  Do a Chad move and draw the deck.
[7708.79s -> 7709.91s]  No, not yet.
[7712.66s -> 7713.38s]  Oh, fuck.
[7717.86s -> 7718.66s]  Now I'm going to use it.
[7719.22s -> 7723.53s]  Here we go.
[7730.76s -> 7732.36s]  That is so good.
[7732.36s -> 7734.52s]  That is just ridiculous.
[7740.10s -> 7744.63s]  Deal two damage to a minion if it survives.
[7744.63s -> 7745.67s]  Give it poisonous.
[7746.31s -> 7748.63s]  I could do that to somebody on my team.
[7755.38s -> 7756.10s]  What did that do?
[7757.06s -> 7761.30s]  Convert your mana into minions and gain an empty mana crystal.
[7765.30s -> 7768.41s]  Okay, deal.
[7768.41s -> 7769.21s]  No, that's not enough.
[7773.88s -> 7774.52s]  That's bad.
[7780.02s -> 7782.42s]  I think I'm going to just put out minions.
[7787.13s -> 7789.69s]  Or yeah, let's just go with the shark.
[7798.94s -> 7799.66s]  That sucks.
[7803.37s -> 7804.17s]  Can I eat this?
[7804.17s -> 7805.85s]  How many turns can I eat this?
[7814.90s -> 7815.54s]  Never mind.
[7816.10s -> 7816.74s]  Never mind.
[7817.30s -> 7818.02s]  That's all good.
[7818.66s -> 7822.70s]  So now, yeah, it's just a DPS race.
[7822.70s -> 7823.02s]  Let's see.
[7823.02s -> 7823.90s]  Give me something crazy.
[7825.27s -> 7825.59s]  Damn it.
[7838.07s -> 7839.03s]  DPS race.
[7839.03s -> 7839.51s]  Let's go.
[7840.47s -> 7844.47s]  I want to get 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12.
[7846.78s -> 7847.74s]  Did he just go twice?
[7850.10s -> 7850.74s]  Okay, hold on.
[7850.74s -> 7856.46s]  4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.
[7871.34s -> 7872.94s]  Oh, no, I thought that was a pick.
[7872.94s -> 7874.46s]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[7874.46s -> 7875.10s]  Can I have it back?
[7882.36s -> 7885.40s]  I thought that was a combo.
[7885.40s -> 7885.64s]  It's all right.
[7885.64s -> 7886.52s]  I'm going to win.
[7886.52s -> 7888.97s]  We shall block your path.
[7888.97s -> 7895.02s]  God damn it.
[7895.02s -> 7896.86s]  That was such a bonehead move.
[7899.99s -> 7900.63s]  All right, I win.
[7902.49s -> 7909.80s]  Let me think about 4, 5, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.
[7909.80s -> 7910.44s]  I got it.
[7910.44s -> 7910.92s]  It's over.
[7925.51s -> 7929.03s]  Thank you, Khadgar, for the 17 health for no reason.
[7938.06s -> 7939.02s]  Where to?
[7939.02s -> 7947.54s]  Look at all these wins.
[7948.50s -> 7949.06s]  I know.
[7949.06s -> 7951.30s]  Isn't it nice to win and not go 0-3 in Arena?
[7952.10s -> 7961.54s]  So we got this is the one.
[7961.54s -> 7966.74s]  Unearthed Raptor, Anub'arak, and N'zoth the Corruptor.
[7967.46s -> 7971.82s]  All these are so new.
[7971.82s -> 7973.26s]  I've never even seen half of these.
[7975.22s -> 7976.10s]  More death rattles.
[7978.57s -> 7980.17s]  All right, Oxana.
[7982.66s -> 7985.46s]  After minion attacks, you deal 2 damage to it.
[7986.02s -> 7991.35s]  So just every time somebody attacks with Cho.
[7992.23s -> 8000.52s]  We haven't seen Cho in...
[8001.24s -> 8002.04s]  I don't want to play him.
[8009.82s -> 8010.86s]  So many of these.
[8010.86s -> 8011.82s]  That's too many of these.
[8018.28s -> 8020.28s]  He died last game, but yeah, thank God.
[8022.34s -> 8023.54s]  All right, should I hold it?
[8031.99s -> 8033.83s]  I love how he's so nice and helpful.
[8034.47s -> 8039.21s]  All right, not yet.
[8042.30s -> 8046.14s]  If your deck has only odd cost cards, draw a card.
[8050.55s -> 8054.07s]  Do people build their decks around having odd costs?
[8054.71s -> 8057.80s]  That seems just strange.
[8060.26s -> 8061.14s]  Not anymore.
[8061.14s -> 8062.50s]  It was overpowered before.
[8063.46s -> 8063.78s]  Damn.
[8067.86s -> 8069.86s]  Well, I would put it out, but maybe...
[8069.86s -> 8072.66s]  Is this the opportunity just to get control right here?
[8073.22s -> 8077.90s]  Or do I just send the cat out to die?
[8077.90s -> 8080.66s]  Let's get it right now.
[8082.38s -> 8083.90s]  And then let's get Vancleef out there too.
[8084.46s -> 8085.10s]  You know what I mean?
[8085.10s -> 8086.22s]  Like, fuck it.
[8099.54s -> 8100.34s]  And then here we go.
[8100.34s -> 8104.98s]  Rush into the bandits.
[8104.98s -> 8110.57s]  This is a good run.
[8111.21s -> 8115.67s]  Cold blood on...
[8128.98s -> 8129.78s]  Do I have any heals?
[8130.82s -> 8133.75s]  Should I pull your hand into your deck?
[8133.75s -> 8134.79s]  Draw that many cards.
[8134.79s -> 8135.27s]  What the...
[8135.27s -> 8136.39s]  Wait, you can do that?
[8137.19s -> 8138.87s]  You just throw your hold hand away and...
[8143.03s -> 8144.31s]  All right, let me think about this.
[8144.31s -> 8144.87s]  I need to...
[8145.51s -> 8146.47s]  I can just get rid of this.
[8147.19s -> 8147.99s]  I might just...
[8147.99s -> 8148.87s]  Hold on, let me think.
[8152.86s -> 8155.50s]  I could just get rid of this and then face again.
[8155.50s -> 8159.42s]  Or get rid of this and then do another cold blood.
[8160.38s -> 8162.87s]  I could pull something.
[8163.43s -> 8164.89s]  Let me pull something.
[8166.49s -> 8166.89s]  Damn it.
[8167.53s -> 8169.22s]  All right, well now I have to do that.
[8189.74s -> 8190.78s]  Oh, I could have killed it.
[8190.78s -> 8191.18s]  It's okay.
[8191.18s -> 8191.58s]  Don't worry.
[8192.46s -> 8195.67s]  I could have killed it.
[8196.55s -> 8197.11s]  It's all right.
[8197.11s -> 8197.59s]  I still can.
[8197.59s -> 8198.15s]  Everything's fine.
[8202.04s -> 8202.92s]  Two lackeys.
[8203.72s -> 8205.90s]  All right, let's do the stupid cat.
[8205.90s -> 8211.50s]  And then the lackey or...
[8211.50s -> 8212.86s]  Yeah, I want the lackeys.
[8215.96s -> 8216.52s]  All right, now...
[8217.32s -> 8219.08s]  Is it worth doing eight damage to face?
[8219.08s -> 8221.56s]  Or should I just hold this forever?
[8221.56s -> 8222.44s]  No, I have to do it.
[8222.44s -> 8223.32s]  I have to go to the face.
[8224.36s -> 8230.74s]  Plus one attack and rush.
[8230.74s -> 8231.70s]  Plus one attack and rush.
[8231.70s -> 8232.42s]  I still have this.
[8233.46s -> 8235.19s]  That's not fair.
[8243.03s -> 8244.31s]  Restart your computer.
[8245.51s -> 8246.87s]  Maybe that'll fix it.
[8246.87s -> 8258.20s]  I don't think I want to do any of this.
[8259.00s -> 8264.54s]  I can't play this.
[8270.14s -> 8271.10s]  This just is a dead card.
[8271.10s -> 8271.66s]  It just dies.
[8272.62s -> 8275.66s]  All right, so lackey and then we'll do the bandits.
[8276.38s -> 8289.18s]  And then I'm gonna give cold blood to somebody.
[8289.98s -> 8293.94s]  Who should I give this to?
[8295.32s -> 8295.56s]  You.
[8297.83s -> 8299.91s]  And then I'm gonna trade you to you.
[8302.90s -> 8304.90s]  And everything's gonna be fine.
[8305.54s -> 8309.00s]  But that's the thing I was talking about.
[8309.00s -> 8319.88s]  All right, well, that's gone immediately.
[8323.14s -> 8323.78s]  I mean, right?
[8326.02s -> 8333.90s]  I feel like I'm gonna get rid of that too.
[8333.90s -> 8337.82s]  I have to get rid of this.
[8338.46s -> 8339.90s]  This thing's gonna keep doing this forever.
[8343.62s -> 8348.02s]  Face is good damage, but he's gonna keep bringing everybody in here.
[8348.58s -> 8359.54s]  If this minion survives damage, I'm gonna copy.
[8359.54s -> 8360.58s]  Don't do the spin thing.
[8361.22s -> 8365.26s]  Combo, destroy a minion.
[8365.26s -> 8365.66s]  Perfect.
[8366.60s -> 8367.08s]  Lackey.
[8368.01s -> 8368.49s]  Into.
[8368.49s -> 8369.37s]  Yeah, lackey.
[8370.33s -> 8373.05s]  Destroy the five, three.
[8376.01s -> 8378.97s]  And then we're gonna go like this.
[8382.70s -> 8383.42s]  Bye, you.
[8385.35s -> 8386.71s]  And then we hold.
[8386.71s -> 8387.35s]  What?
[8387.35s -> 8393.02s]  Yeah, because they'll just die.
[8402.68s -> 8412.74s]  Play the totem.
[8413.94s -> 8415.54s]  The totem dies.
[8415.54s -> 8416.26s]  It doesn't do anything.
[8418.52s -> 8419.24s]  Well, here we go.
[8420.04s -> 8420.94s]  Give me something good.
[8423.83s -> 8425.35s]  That's really fucking good.
[8426.07s -> 8432.89s]  Here we go.
[8436.36s -> 8437.72s]  Oh, damn it.
[8437.72s -> 8450.68s]  What's going on?
[8471.37s -> 8476.28s]  Hey, hey, there it is.
[8476.28s -> 8477.72s]  Summon King Mukla.
[8477.72s -> 8480.44s]  Give it immune and can't be targeted by spells or hero powers.
[8483.70s -> 8484.74s]  Thanks, Khadgar.
[8484.74s -> 8485.30s]  Appreciate it.
[8485.30s -> 8486.74s]  Now it doesn't even matter.
[8486.74s -> 8493.67s]  If I have, I think I win.
[8500.17s -> 8501.05s]  What is he doing?
[8503.99s -> 8506.23s]  Why did he just do all that at the very end here?
[8506.23s -> 8508.87s]  Thanks for nothing for the first like 12 turns.
[8509.59s -> 8517.96s]  What do you guys think?
[8526.82s -> 8528.02s]  How am I this good?
[8529.43s -> 8530.79s]  Well, it takes a lot of practice.
[8531.51s -> 8538.60s]  All right, shuffle five random treasures into your deck.
[8538.60s -> 8540.12s]  I don't think I've ever even seen what this does.
[8540.76s -> 8543.69s]  Take an extra turn.
[8543.69s -> 8545.37s]  Your opponent takes an extra turn after.
[8546.01s -> 8548.90s]  That kind of sucks.
[8549.46s -> 8550.74s]  This one's pretty good.
[8550.74s -> 8553.78s]  Draw this every turn at the start of every game you draw this.
[8553.78s -> 8559.13s]  It has taunt and it gets plus one plus one every turn it's in my hand.
[8564.22s -> 8564.70s]  Taking this.
[8565.34s -> 8569.34s]  What do you think?
[8569.34s -> 8573.11s]  We're getting close to the last like two or three.
[8573.11s -> 8575.27s]  Usually the last two or three are usually pretty hard.
[8576.38s -> 8580.10s]  They're just so just random all over the place.
[8580.10s -> 8584.82s]  It's hard to beat them sometimes and I don't this is kind of split here.
[8585.46s -> 8587.82s]  58, 20.
[8587.82s -> 8589.77s]  There we go.
[8589.77s -> 8590.65s]  Draw!
[8590.65s -> 8592.49s]  You want me to start getting some draw?
[8596.20s -> 8597.08s]  Is this the last one?
[8600.50s -> 8602.18s]  We got some pretty good shit though.
[8602.18s -> 8607.59s]  Okay, now this is it.
[8614.47s -> 8617.19s]  Code a minion and blast powder when it takes damage destroyed.
[8617.19s -> 8617.91s]  I remember this.
[8619.35s -> 8622.07s]  There's something, there's some wires and stuff.
[8622.07s -> 8622.95s]  I'm gonna fuck this up.
[8629.53s -> 8633.29s]  Yeah, if these two wires touch you take five damage at the beginning of the turn or something.
[8633.93s -> 8637.83s]  But the stealth is just so overpowered.
[8643.19s -> 8649.83s]  Permanent stealth against this character.
[8652.30s -> 8653.74s]  It will never activate.
[8655.42s -> 8657.42s]  It's never gonna activate when I get him out there.
[8659.26s -> 8660.14s]  That's so funny.
[8663.19s -> 8664.15s]  He's not gonna be able to do it.
[8664.39s -> 8674.14s]  Wait, did I give you the wire?
[8676.52s -> 8677.16s]  All right, well let's...
[8678.82s -> 8681.86s]  The only time that this card has ever been useful is right now.
[8682.42s -> 8684.71s]  Well, I can't really do anything so...
[8686.97s -> 8688.49s]  And I got Ragnaros.
[8688.49s -> 8690.17s]  Random Ragnaros Lightlord.
[8690.17s -> 8692.57s]  I'm not, it's impossible for me to lose.
[8695.30s -> 8695.86s]  It just isn't.
[8696.58s -> 8697.54s]  I, there's no way.
[8697.54s -> 8698.66s]  It's impossible.
[8698.66s -> 8704.42s]  It used to be about the explosions man.
[8704.42s -> 8705.14s]  What happened?
[8710.95s -> 8711.67s]  Okay, but hold on.
[8711.67s -> 8714.47s]  Don't get too overconfident because I still have to like do this.
[8718.55s -> 8720.15s]  I still have to get here.
[8720.15s -> 8723.67s]  So this is actually a really terrible start.
[8729.21s -> 8729.85s]  Four, one.
[8736.09s -> 8736.73s]  This is bad.
[8740.68s -> 8743.00s]  If I play the miscreen I'm not gonna get the combo though.
[8743.00s -> 8743.72s]  And he's just gonna...
[8746.09s -> 8746.97s]  I guess it makes sense.
[8754.54s -> 8757.98s]  He's starting to load up to a point where I actually might lose.
[8763.08s -> 8765.24s]  I'm getting way too high cost cards.
[8765.80s -> 8766.68s]  This is very bad.
[8768.41s -> 8769.85s]  All right, four, who's...
[8769.85s -> 8770.73s]  Okay, I gotta get rid of you.
[8772.68s -> 8774.20s]  So I gotta take out you.
[8775.00s -> 8779.43s]  So I'm gonna do that with an cold blood.
[8785.18s -> 8787.10s]  That will give me able to clear it.
[8787.10s -> 8787.98s]  Okay, that's what I'm doing.
[8788.62s -> 8800.23s]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[8800.23s -> 8801.08s]  It's okay.
[8811.37s -> 8812.15s]  It's fine.
[8812.15s -> 8812.63s]  Everything's good.
[8812.63s -> 8813.03s]  It's all right.
[8813.03s -> 8815.83s]  I can, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right.
[8815.83s -> 8820.22s]  I'm just gonna get the darkness out there and everything seems fine.
[8830.41s -> 8832.49s]  Oh no, should I do King Wukla?
[8832.49s -> 8833.85s]  Maybe I should just do King Wukla.
[8837.90s -> 8838.40s]  Or...
[8841.56s -> 8843.16s]  It doesn't work like that?
[8843.16s -> 8843.96s]  That won't work?
[8846.22s -> 8848.14s]  Oh, it spawns over here.
[8848.14s -> 8849.34s]  Oh, Jesus.
[8849.34s -> 8849.84s]  Okay.
[8856.20s -> 8857.32s]  Does this count as a minion?
[8857.32s -> 8858.76s]  Okay, at the first second I dump...
[8858.76s -> 8859.96s]  Does this count as a minion?
[8859.96s -> 8869.67s]  I just gotta make it to round eight.
[8870.86s -> 8871.98s]  All right, this is how we do this.
[8873.43s -> 8875.10s]  We go.
[8875.10s -> 8875.60s]  Bang.
[8879.34s -> 8879.98s]  Knuckles?
[8879.98s -> 8881.10s]  No, I need to get rid of...
[8884.15s -> 8885.75s]  I'm just gonna shuriken the zombie.
[8888.55s -> 8890.87s]  And then I'm gonna eviscerate him.
[8900.25s -> 8900.89s]  And then steal.
[8901.53s -> 8904.92s]  What the hell happened?
[8906.50s -> 8907.38s]  Oh, come on.
[8918.46s -> 8919.74s]  Thank God, nobody was stealthed.
[8919.74s -> 8920.70s]  That's no stealth card.
[8928.22s -> 8932.50s]  All right, now we've got King Wukla now.
[8933.40s -> 8933.90s]  Or...
[8935.59s -> 8951.46s]  Yeah, that's time for Wukla.
[8951.46s -> 8953.74s]  What?
[8953.74s -> 8954.70s]  Why are you doing this?
[8954.70s -> 8956.62s]  Oh my God, this is so bad for him.
[8958.30s -> 8959.90s]  That was so bad.
[8959.90s -> 8961.74s]  Holy shit, that was terrible.
[8961.74s -> 8963.18s]  That's the...
[8963.18s -> 8963.90s]  Hey, is that...
[8963.90s -> 8966.30s]  Hey, is that Jermadonite V playing on the other team?
[8968.38s -> 8975.37s]  But hold on.
[8975.37s -> 8976.25s]  Ragnaros time.
[8977.37s -> 8978.57s]  No, I can't lose!
[8979.61s -> 8980.57s]  That was a voice crack.
[8980.57s -> 8981.07s]  It's okay.
[8988.87s -> 8990.55s]  Yeah, now I guess I'm fine.
[9007.99s -> 9014.39s]  How do I take care of that?
[9014.39s -> 9015.27s]  What do I do about this?
[9016.07s -> 9016.57s]  Hold on.
[9018.84s -> 9019.88s]  I can't be...
[9019.88s -> 9021.80s]  I can't have him taunting because he has permanent stealth.
[9027.05s -> 9028.65s]  Nobody can taunt because they're stealthed.
[9039.69s -> 9040.25s]  I lose.
[9040.89s -> 9053.78s]  I'm actually gonna lose because I can't put on the weapon.
[9057.30s -> 9057.94s]  Play Edwin.
[9059.93s -> 9061.85s]  Just attack with it, but he's...
[9062.94s -> 9063.98s]  I'm in trouble.
[9066.92s -> 9090.54s]  Yeet him!
[9090.54s -> 9092.86s]  Seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven!
[9092.86s -> 9094.68s]  It's not...
[9094.68s -> 9095.24s]  I got it.
[9095.24s -> 9096.78s]  What?
[9096.78s -> 9111.53s]  Is this gonna counterspell me?
[9111.53s -> 9112.90s]  All right.
[9112.90s -> 9113.78s]  We're okay.
[9113.78s -> 9131.69s]  We're back to normal.
[9131.69s -> 9136.65s]  So I'm like scared.
[9136.65s -> 9138.17s]  Can you draw a candle already, please?
[9138.81s -> 9141.50s]  Thank you for that.
[9141.50s -> 9142.06s]  I'll take it.
[9142.78s -> 9145.35s]  Shuffle five random treasures into your deck.
[9146.73s -> 9147.77s]  All right, give me these.
[9147.77s -> 9150.89s]  I have 28 cards in my deck.
[9150.89s -> 9156.92s]  I'm never gonna see those.
[9156.92s -> 9158.92s]  I can't even kill this!
[9158.92s -> 9159.96s]  Four, five, six...
[9159.96s -> 9160.36s]  I'm gonna...
[9160.92s -> 9166.54s]  Where's the...
[9166.54s -> 9168.78s]  Discover a druid, rogue, or shaman card.
[9172.63s -> 9173.03s]  Let's see.
[9173.75s -> 9177.26s]  Deal two damage to the enemy hero.
[9177.26s -> 9179.18s]  If you control a treant, discover a spell.
[9179.18s -> 9180.46s]  When you overload, I don't...
[9182.14s -> 9183.74s]  Headcrack is the only thing I can do.
[9187.02s -> 9192.78s]  And then just get out the raptor?
[9201.69s -> 9202.49s]  Well, give me the heal.
[9212.98s -> 9215.72s]  Now draw the fucking candles.
[9219.53s -> 9221.37s]  What did I just get?
[9221.37s -> 9222.01s]  What's going on?
[9222.65s -> 9226.17s]  Your opponent summoned a minion from their deck and I got...
[9226.17s -> 9226.65s]  Sneed!
[9228.12s -> 9228.52s]  All right.
[9228.52s -> 9228.92s]  Hold on.
[9229.56s -> 9235.45s]  Do I have like one damage?
[9235.45s -> 9238.94s]  Is this thing gonna get...
[9238.94s -> 9239.26s]  Sneed?
[9244.14s -> 9244.78s]  Give me the shit.
[9245.90s -> 9249.54s]  Okay.
[9249.54s -> 9253.62s]  What?
[9253.62s -> 9254.90s]  Go dormant?
[9254.90s -> 9256.34s]  Play four cards?
[9256.34s -> 9257.94s]  What's with all this dormant shit?
[9260.15s -> 9261.43s]  I need to make space.
[9261.43s -> 9261.91s]  Oh, right.
[9261.91s -> 9262.63s]  I have to make space.
[9263.27s -> 9264.31s]  Let's kill this guy.
[9266.23s -> 9267.83s]  And then you die here.
[9268.71s -> 9269.83s]  So now there's enough space.
[9270.71s -> 9274.78s]  And then Thor is sent.
[9281.78s -> 9283.06s]  I'm in a pretty good spot now.
[9283.06s -> 9283.54s]  I'm pretty...
[9283.54s -> 9284.34s]  This should be it.
[9288.39s -> 9290.09s]  Free and real.
[9290.73s -> 9291.29s]  Holy fuck.
[9291.29s -> 9292.01s]  That would have been awesome.
[9292.73s -> 9298.79s]  All right.
[9298.79s -> 9301.45s]  So now just give me that.
[9306.30s -> 9310.31s]  Now we're gonna just load him up.
[9311.11s -> 9324.31s]  What happened?
[9326.18s -> 9331.50s]  Doesn't matter, motherfucker.
[9332.62s -> 9333.66s]  It doesn't matter.
[9334.70s -> 9335.69s]  Hey.
[9336.71s -> 9346.15s]  Draw two minions from your deck.
[9346.95s -> 9348.71s]  Set their attack health and cost to one?
[9349.67s -> 9353.35s]  This is baby shit.
[9353.35s -> 9353.85s]  Uh-oh.
[9354.63s -> 9355.59s]  No, he's not scary.
[9356.39s -> 9359.96s]  All right.
[9359.96s -> 9361.08s]  Do I win with an extra turn?
[9364.20s -> 9365.88s]  That's seven.
[9365.88s -> 9366.44s]  Fourteen.
[9367.50s -> 9368.14s]  No.
[9368.14s -> 9370.49s]  I don't win with an extra turn.
[9371.13s -> 9372.65s]  I gotta clear this though,
[9372.65s -> 9373.61s]  because he has no cards.
[9375.83s -> 9376.87s]  I gotta play this right.
[9377.59s -> 9378.31s]  Three damage.
[9379.11s -> 9381.19s]  So get your text off the screen.
[9381.19s -> 9381.91s]  I'm trying to focus.
[9385.58s -> 9386.22s]  Headcrack.
[9386.22s -> 9387.34s]  I don't win with a headcrack.
[9388.68s -> 9390.04s]  Two turns of 26...
[9390.04s -> 9390.52s]  Head...
[9390.52s -> 9390.84s]  What do you mean?
[9390.84s -> 9391.32s]  Wait, what?
[9398.10s -> 9398.98s]  It is lethal.
[9400.44s -> 9401.00s]  Seven.
[9401.00s -> 9401.56s]  Fourteen.
[9403.19s -> 9403.67s]  Nineteen.
[9404.63s -> 9405.27s]  Twenty-four.
[9406.92s -> 9407.24s]  Twenty...
[9428.54s -> 9433.85s]  What happened?
[9433.85s -> 9435.14s]  What happened?
[9435.14s -> 9435.62s]  Oh, okay.
[9446.90s -> 9447.46s]  Oh, fuck.
[9447.46s -> 9449.22s]  Oh, I'm miss-clicking.
[9454.92s -> 9456.60s]  I thought I had to do it afterwards.
[9461.18s -> 9461.66s]  Tuber.
[9463.99s -> 9464.55s]  LOL.
[9464.55s -> 9465.19s]  So funny.
[9465.19s -> 9466.15s]  Hey, run complete.
[9466.15s -> 9467.03s]  I did it with the rogue.
[9468.22s -> 9468.86s]  This is fun.
[9473.83s -> 9477.58s]  Hooray.
[9477.58s -> 9478.14s]  Alright.
[9478.14s -> 9478.46s]  Again.
[9485.22s -> 9486.26s]  Now do that on heroic.
[9487.14s -> 9488.18s]  I'm not ready for heroic.
[9495.64s -> 9496.76s]  I'm not ready for heroic.
[9496.76s -> 9497.16s]  You are?
[9498.04s -> 9499.08s]  Alright, I'll try it once.
[9515.75s -> 9516.07s]  Okay.
[9516.07s -> 9517.19s]  Chapter one, heroic.
[9518.58s -> 9520.98s]  I'm not going to be able to do this.
[9520.98s -> 9521.94s]  I'm not ready for this.
[9522.66s -> 9531.77s]  Play anomaly mode?
[9531.77s -> 9532.89s]  What is anomaly mode?
[9533.85s -> 9540.65s]  Alright, we got druid.
[9541.29s -> 9545.61s]  Looks like people want to see druid.
[9546.25s -> 9548.90s]  Anomaly is more random rules.
[9548.90s -> 9549.54s]  That's cool.
[9550.34s -> 9553.96s]  Alright, we're going to do druid.
[9554.76s -> 9555.56s]  I'm going to pee.
[9558.54s -> 9560.70s]  So, you guys can pick.
[9562.57s -> 9564.25s]  There's nothing for you to pick, so never mind.
[9565.21s -> 9567.40s]  And there's just this.
[9568.12s -> 9568.60s]  Okay.
[9571.38s -> 9572.50s]  Well, I'm not going to pee.
[9572.50s -> 9573.46s]  Well, I'm not going to pee yet.
[9573.46s -> 9575.22s]  Let me see if I can get through the first person.
[9581.11s -> 9586.55s]  Okay, so this is swap the leftmost card in each player's hand with one in their deck.
[9587.27s -> 9591.42s]  So, you just everybody on the left swaps out.
[9591.42s -> 9593.02s]  Let's see if I can even do the first level.
[9599.29s -> 9600.97s]  I'm not embarrassed if I can't do this on heroic.
[9609.42s -> 9609.90s]  Do I pee?
[9609.90s -> 9610.22s]  I will.
[9611.02s -> 9611.42s]  After this.
[9617.32s -> 9618.44s]  He's going to get embarrassed.
[9618.44s -> 9618.76s]  Maybe.
[9619.56s -> 9622.57s]  This is the one with the coins in the middle.
[9625.50s -> 9626.54s]  Alright, what do you think?
[9626.54s -> 9628.86s]  After this minion attacks a hero, add a copy of it to your hand.
[9628.86s -> 9629.58s]  That's not bad.
[9630.54s -> 9632.14s]  Add two 1-1 squirrels.
[9632.94s -> 9633.74s]  Yeah, definitely this.
[9638.22s -> 9638.78s]  Oh, shit.
[9638.78s -> 9639.90s]  You're going to pull that.
[9639.90s -> 9640.38s]  That's alright.
[9646.10s -> 9649.22s]  Give a friendly minion 1-1 and gain armor equal to its attack.
[9656.60s -> 9656.92s]  Shit.
[9665.85s -> 9666.65s]  I need to play this.
[9667.61s -> 9669.21s]  Because this is going to disappear.
[9676.04s -> 9677.48s]  I already lost.
[9679.02s -> 9684.14s]  And then give this the 1-1 so it can't die from here.
[9688.55s -> 9690.07s]  Yeah, let's try it.
[9690.07s -> 9690.95s]  I'm not going to attack.
[9696.01s -> 9697.69s]  That's actually really good.
[9697.69s -> 9698.73s]  I'm happy that just happened.
[9699.69s -> 9702.98s]  Minus two attack until your next turn.
[9702.98s -> 9703.70s]  What the fuck.
[9704.50s -> 9711.98s]  After you summon a minion, give it plus one plus one.
[9712.78s -> 9717.82s]  Shit.
[9718.38s -> 9722.34s]  I'm just going to have to...
[9727.19s -> 9728.90s]  Do I even attack?
[9729.70s -> 9734.04s]  This is going to kill me.
[9741.48s -> 9741.80s]  Shit.
[9745.48s -> 9746.68s]  Okay, that's not horrible.
[9749.80s -> 9755.66s]  Gain six armor, recruit a minion that costs four or less.
[9756.84s -> 9759.08s]  Or do I shapeshift into this?
[9773.26s -> 9773.98s]  Because then they'll get...
[9773.98s -> 9774.70s]  Okay, and then...
[9780.60s -> 9781.40s]  That's pretty good.
[9783.08s -> 9783.88s]  Should I do them all?
[9784.52s -> 9790.47s]  All right, this is where it gets to be...
[9794.25s -> 9795.21s]  I have to get rid of that.
[9807.24s -> 9809.72s]  Value trade 3-2 in face of 2-1.
[9811.24s -> 9811.48s]  Yeah.
[9814.47s -> 9814.79s]  Yeah.
[9816.33s -> 9817.53s]  Thank you, guy in the chat.
[9818.33s -> 9821.29s]  Appreciate all that good stuff that you just told me.
[9826.50s -> 9828.02s]  You know, it's heroic, so I'm just...
[9828.74s -> 9830.26s]  I don't know why my brain is like,
[9830.26s -> 9831.86s]  no, no, no, everything needs to be...
[9831.86s -> 9833.46s]  Be careful, I need help.
[9833.46s -> 9835.30s]  I think that's it.
[9835.30s -> 9835.70s]  Yeah, that's it.
[9837.54s -> 9844.38s]  That was easy.
[9844.38s -> 9845.26s]  It was.
[9845.26s -> 9846.38s]  I'm overthinking things.
[9846.38s -> 9846.94s]  All right, I'm going to pee.
[9848.14s -> 9848.94s]  Well, you vote for the...
[9849.66s -> 9850.46s]  So difficult.
[9851.50s -> 9854.22s]  There you go.
[9855.10s -> 9856.06s]  Let's see what it's going to be.
[9856.94s -> 9861.08s]  Draw two cards at the start of the game.
[9861.72s -> 9863.48s]  Gain two armor when somebody dies.
[9864.55s -> 9867.11s]  Or your death rattles trigger twice.
[9867.75s -> 9874.36s]  How many death rattles do I have?
[9875.24s -> 9877.35s]  I think one or two.
[9879.72s -> 9879.96s]  Two.
[9883.86s -> 9884.18s]  Three.
[9893.00s -> 9894.44s]  All right, yeah, I mean, if we're going to pick this,
[9894.44s -> 9896.28s]  then we're going to go straight up death rattle.
[9899.53s -> 9900.65s]  Is there a death rattle here?
[9906.65s -> 9907.05s]  Gruul.
[9907.85s -> 9908.81s]  Well, there is one.
[9913.62s -> 9915.30s]  The mulch muncher?
[9922.30s -> 9923.26s]  Big friends.
[9926.31s -> 9928.71s]  Summon a minion from your hand with five or more attack.
[9930.25s -> 9932.73s]  Yeah, that doesn't do anything for us, unfortunately.
[9934.26s -> 9935.78s]  But Gruul is just Gruul.
[9938.15s -> 9938.95s]  Yeah, that sucks.
[9938.95s -> 9941.11s]  Summon five minions with five or more attack.
[9941.59s -> 9944.55s]  And we have to start working on this shit, too.
[9950.46s -> 9953.08s]  Well, the people want Gruul.
[9953.72s -> 9957.35s]  So they're going to get Gruul.
[9957.99s -> 9958.89s]  All right, OEP.
[9959.45s -> 9960.60s]  I'll be right back.
[9963.64s -> 9965.64s]  Haven't been playing Hearthstone for three hours.
[9965.64s -> 9966.44s]  Damn.
[9966.44s -> 9969.11s]  I'm having fun, though.
[9969.11s -> 9969.75s]  It's a fun game.
[9971.43s -> 9976.79s]  When you have 3,500 people help you make decisions on every play.
[9977.59s -> 9978.07s]  It's fun.
[9978.63s -> 9979.19s]  I'll be right back.
[10182.06s -> 10185.96s]  Okay, sorry I was going for a little bit longer.
[10185.96s -> 10191.86s]  I wanted to get a drink because it's been like four hours
[10191.86s -> 10193.30s]  and I haven't really had anything to drink.
[10193.30s -> 10195.86s]  So I had coffee sitting here.
[10196.58s -> 10202.02s]  But I needed something a little more substantial.
[10202.66s -> 10203.22s]  All right, let's go.
[10207.86s -> 10208.50s]  What's the drink?
[10208.50s -> 10210.42s]  It is just a sparkling water.
[10211.06s -> 10216.46s]  It's not anything too interesting.
[10223.99s -> 10225.27s]  Just a little bit of bubbles.
[10225.27s -> 10226.55s]  All right, so do I even play this shit?
[10227.51s -> 10229.90s]  I don't think I even have these in my deck.
[10230.62s -> 10244.04s]  Pineapple juice is going to kill you, you know.
[10244.04s -> 10244.76s]  Ooh, that's good.
[10245.40s -> 10247.00s]  All right, what does he do?
[10247.80s -> 10253.74s]  All right, add a random magical feat to your hand.
[10254.30s -> 10256.52s]  All right, so he puts feet in his hand.
[10257.24s -> 10260.06s]  So death rattles trigger twice.
[10260.06s -> 10260.78s]  Let's get the...
[10261.42s -> 10262.30s]  Let's get him out there.
[10274.97s -> 10275.37s]  Get that.
[10277.86s -> 10281.00s]  Ooh, give me millions.
[10281.00s -> 10281.56s]  One, one.
[10282.78s -> 10283.74s]  Well, this thing is free.
[10283.74s -> 10284.70s]  So here, just play it.
[10285.86s -> 10286.66s]  All right, summon two.
[10290.58s -> 10294.86s]  Or, yeah, let's just get rid of this.
[10294.86s -> 10297.51s]  Do I want the one, one?
[10297.51s -> 10298.79s]  No, because it's a twin spell.
[10298.79s -> 10299.75s]  Did it bring out the trance?
[10300.47s -> 10303.38s]  Just bring them all out.
[10307.50s -> 10308.22s]  I'm going for it.
[10309.18s -> 10311.93s]  I'm going for a kill immediately.
[10324.33s -> 10325.37s]  All right, that was a good outcome.
[10328.01s -> 10328.49s]  Jesus.
[10328.49s -> 10330.73s]  Give a friendly mini one, one, then gain attack equal...
[10330.73s -> 10332.41s]  The armor equal to its attack.
[10334.31s -> 10336.15s]  So I gotta think about this here.
[10338.14s -> 10344.52s]  So we get two, two.
[10347.00s -> 10348.12s]  And then I could get rid of that.
[10350.86s -> 10352.38s]  All right, so hold on.
[10353.02s -> 10354.60s]  I can...
[10356.94s -> 10360.79s]  Two fucking goddamn math.
[10361.77s -> 10362.73s]  I can't do math.
[10362.73s -> 10363.21s]  Yes, I can.
[10376.06s -> 10395.45s]  Was that wrong?
[10398.33s -> 10399.77s]  That was okay.
[10400.41s -> 10402.01s]  That wasn't completely wrong, was it?
[10403.78s -> 10404.42s]  Was it wrong?
[10404.42s -> 10405.22s]  No, it was right.
[10410.10s -> 10411.06s]  It was a little bit wrong.
[10411.06s -> 10411.78s]  Wasn't that wrong?
[10411.78s -> 10412.34s]  It was okay.
[10413.30s -> 10417.77s]  All right, I can do this twice.
[10418.65s -> 10419.21s]  Again.
[10419.21s -> 10425.99s]  So we're going to one, one onto six armor.
[10425.99s -> 10426.79s]  That's insane.
[10428.07s -> 10428.47s]  I think I...
[10428.47s -> 10429.43s]  Do I have it?
[10430.41s -> 10434.41s]  Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[10436.54s -> 10443.82s]  No, I don't have it.
[10443.82s -> 10445.66s]  Oh, it's all minions.
[10445.66s -> 10448.06s]  Oh, I thought it was give a minion.
[10448.46s -> 10450.97s]  Minion.
[10450.97s -> 10456.64s]  All right.
[10466.73s -> 10474.71s]  Three mana, give a minion, one, one.
[10474.71s -> 10477.03s]  Yeah, that would be absolute dog shit.
[10477.03s -> 10478.71s]  What the hell am I talking about?
[10478.71s -> 10483.26s]  Look at how desperate he is right now.
[10483.26s -> 10484.38s]  He's trying so hard.
[10484.38s -> 10485.10s]  He's going to lose.
[10498.89s -> 10499.93s]  Am I going to get to play?
[10501.51s -> 10501.91s]  Jesus.
[10502.55s -> 10518.74s]  Get that squirrel BM.
[10518.74s -> 10519.38s]  Not a big deal.
[10522.57s -> 10523.37s]  All right.
[10523.37s -> 10525.42s]  What do you guys think?
[10529.43s -> 10532.15s]  Do you not need to kill the gold treasure thing?
[10532.15s -> 10535.94s]  No, what it does is it gives both players two coins.
[10537.11s -> 10539.72s]  So, you know, you could...
[10540.44s -> 10544.44s]  Time for arena.
[10545.08s -> 10546.97s]  Now that was so embarrassing.
[10546.97s -> 10547.93s]  That just was so...
[10548.73s -> 10550.42s]  I can't.
[10550.42s -> 10551.86s]  I can't do that again.
[10551.86s -> 10553.94s]  All right, we got big friends.
[10554.66s -> 10559.35s]  Should we try it one more time before I stop?
[10559.99s -> 10562.46s]  I have to redeem myself.
[10562.46s -> 10562.78s]  Yeah.
[10562.78s -> 10563.18s]  All right.
[10563.18s -> 10564.06s]  I'll try it.
[10564.06s -> 10564.46s]  Not now.
[10565.64s -> 10566.84s]  After like another run or two.
[10568.70s -> 10569.66s]  I'm still having fun.
[10571.18s -> 10572.54s]  It's just fun just to...
[10572.54s -> 10574.46s]  I'm not very good.
[10574.46s -> 10576.38s]  How many times is he going to say he's not good?
[10577.34s -> 10577.58s]  All right.
[10577.58s -> 10578.14s]  We'll take this.
[10585.22s -> 10586.18s]  The Amazing Boomer.
[10586.74s -> 10590.52s]  Cast a random spell that was cast this game
[10590.52s -> 10592.44s]  chosen randomly on targets.
[10593.08s -> 10594.44s]  Okay.
[10594.44s -> 10595.77s]  Cool.
[10595.77s -> 10596.25s]  Interesting.
[10615.66s -> 10616.14s]  All right.
[10616.14s -> 10617.98s]  I still don't have enough.
[10618.78s -> 10619.58s]  Maybe I do now.
[10622.41s -> 10625.05s]  How many minions do I have over five attack?
[10625.77s -> 10628.95s]  I think I have it now.
[10630.66s -> 10632.90s]  But they're all late game cards.
[10639.54s -> 10640.98s]  What happened to Cooking Simulator?
[10640.98s -> 10642.82s]  Unfortunately, I had the release date wrong.
[10643.62s -> 10645.62s]  The game doesn't actually launch until tomorrow.
[10646.84s -> 10653.08s]  So I figured, hey, I'm just going to play Hearthstone for some reason.
[10654.89s -> 10656.73s]  Odd that that's the thing that decided...
[10656.73s -> 10658.17s]  I just felt like it.
[10658.97s -> 10661.40s]  And on this channel, we just do anything.
[10662.97s -> 10665.93s]  Even if it's to the detriment of my channel.
[10665.93s -> 10666.89s]  It doesn't matter.
[10669.26s -> 10671.02s]  Let's go with the...
[10671.02s -> 10671.66s]  What are you doing?
[10681.10s -> 10689.59s]  I used to be my favorite card in the game.
[10690.95s -> 10691.75s]  I still love that thing.
[10692.78s -> 10693.98s]  Doesn't seem like a detriment.
[10693.98s -> 10695.26s]  No, I'm just kidding around.
[10696.14s -> 10696.70s]  I'm just kidding.
[10699.72s -> 10700.60s]  One, one.
[10700.60s -> 10702.12s]  And then gain his attack and armor.
[10702.12s -> 10703.24s]  Maybe I should do it to you.
[10704.12s -> 10705.56s]  And get the coins and then do...
[10707.32s -> 10708.12s]  That's what I'm going for?
[10708.84s -> 10709.72s]  Could be the wrong play.
[10711.16s -> 10712.12s]  Might be the wrong play.
[10713.00s -> 10713.80s]  But it's what I'm going to do.
[10727.74s -> 10732.04s]  We have many secrets.
[10736.09s -> 10736.89s]  Have you ever played...
[10736.89s -> 10737.21s]  Tried...
[10738.57s -> 10739.37s]  What is...
[10739.37s -> 10739.85s]  I don't know.
[10739.85s -> 10740.17s]  What's it?
[10741.75s -> 10742.31s]  Hearthstone?
[10742.31s -> 10743.67s]  A good way to win at Hearthstone?
[10745.18s -> 10746.30s]  I feel like that's a...
[10746.30s -> 10747.02s]  Is it a thing?
[10747.02s -> 10747.98s]  I'm not saying that.
[10747.98s -> 10748.62s]  I don't know about it.
[10750.06s -> 10750.46s]  What am I...
[10752.09s -> 10752.81s]  I'm not reading that.
[10758.68s -> 10759.24s]  It's...
[10759.24s -> 10760.28s]  Talk to the S.
[10760.28s -> 10760.68s]  Okay.
[10760.68s -> 10761.48s]  I don't know what that is.
[10761.48s -> 10762.60s]  And I almost said I don't know what it is.
[10763.80s -> 10766.36s]  Well, that's a perfect exact mana cost card.
[10766.92s -> 10772.90s]  With a mage secret.
[10772.90s -> 10773.46s]  Oh, shit.
[10777.70s -> 10778.58s]  What is it?
[10778.58s -> 10780.02s]  It's going to be like Vaporize, right?
[10780.66s -> 10781.38s]  It's Vaporize.
[10792.65s -> 10793.53s]  So many squirrels.
[10795.05s -> 10796.25s]  It's not a beast?
[10796.97s -> 10797.37s]  Damn.
[10798.33s -> 10801.62s]  Twin spell?
[10801.62s -> 10802.26s]  No, I can't do that.
[10809.42s -> 10810.14s]  All squirrels?
[10812.18s -> 10813.22s]  And then get Vaporized?
[10814.81s -> 10815.93s]  All squirrels and then...
[10817.26s -> 10817.66s]  Wait a minute.
[10819.10s -> 10820.54s]  And I'm loving it!
[10820.54s -> 10821.26s]  Holy shit.
[10821.26s -> 10821.74s]  Calm down.
[10822.38s -> 10828.17s]  Let's see what this is.
[10831.00s -> 10831.32s]  Three...
[10831.96s -> 10832.52s]  Hold on.
[10832.52s -> 10832.92s]  Hold on.
[10833.80s -> 10834.44s]  Four?
[10834.44s -> 10835.08s]  Five?
[10835.08s -> 10835.48s]  Four?
[10835.48s -> 10835.96s]  Five?
[10835.96s -> 10836.20s]  Six.
[10836.92s -> 10840.01s]  So then should I get twin spell twice on the squirrel?
[10871.27s -> 10872.39s]  Oh, shit!
[10872.39s -> 10873.75s]  You motherfucker!
[10873.75s -> 10875.19s]  You just ruined everything!
[10875.19s -> 10875.69s]  Why?
[10879.64s -> 10880.14s]  No!
[10880.52s -> 10881.00s]  It's all right.
[10881.00s -> 10881.56s]  I can do it next...
[10881.56s -> 10882.84s]  I can twin spell it next turn.
[10882.84s -> 10883.72s]  He's not going to kill all this.
[10893.67s -> 10894.31s]  Yeah, coining...
[10895.27s -> 10897.99s]  This is bad now.
[10898.63s -> 10903.34s]  At least I get two of them.
[10905.88s -> 10907.72s]  Actually, it's a good thing I didn't do this.
[10907.72s -> 10908.76s]  Although, man, it sucks.
[10910.22s -> 10911.10s]  Too bad I still...
[10911.10s -> 10912.62s]  I wish I had that fucking other coin.
[10912.62s -> 10913.90s]  I could have done Gruul this turn.
[10913.90s -> 10920.49s]  Oh, that's not a beat.
[10920.49s -> 10922.33s]  I just get the tiger out there again and then...
[10927.96s -> 10931.38s]  Oh, look at this loser.
[10931.38s -> 10932.02s]  What did you say to me?
[10939.75s -> 10941.30s]  I got lots of armor.
[10942.10s -> 10946.10s]  None of these beasts.
[10950.26s -> 10950.66s]  All right.
[10950.66s -> 10952.74s]  Coin Gruul or Coin Chromagus?
[10953.38s -> 10956.87s]  I'm going to say Coin Gruul.
[10962.58s -> 10967.30s]  And then I...
[10967.30s -> 10967.94s]  Ah, hold on.
[10968.66s -> 10976.95s]  Can I get rid of the Sorcerer's Apprentice
[10976.95s -> 10978.79s]  or get rid of the Karantor Mage?
[10979.67s -> 10980.55s]  I'm going to say Mage.
[10985.40s -> 10986.68s]  Or I could just hit him.
[10986.68s -> 10987.48s]  Hopefully that was right.
[10988.36s -> 10990.18s]  I didn't trade.
[10993.26s -> 10995.06s]  Not good.
[10996.66s -> 10997.30s]  Should have traded.
[11000.12s -> 11001.72s]  I was supposed to trade,
[11001.72s -> 11003.96s]  and now it's going to come back and bite me.
[11003.96s -> 11009.82s]  Chromagus is gone.
[11009.82s -> 11010.78s]  I didn't get to do it once.
[11011.58s -> 11018.04s]  You control three menus of seven health
[11018.04s -> 11019.96s]  and deal seven damage to all enemies.
[11020.52s -> 11023.77s]  Well, it's time for Gruul.
[11031.66s -> 11032.16s]  Ouch.
[11043.56s -> 11044.84s]  This is so bad.
[11047.83s -> 11049.51s]  Put SP in the title.
[11049.51s -> 11050.95s]  Or, I mean, this is not...
[11050.95s -> 11056.97s]  Nobody gets sponsored to play Hearthstone.
[11056.97s -> 11057.47s]  What?
[11058.97s -> 11061.90s]  I think I'm just going to go with the 777.
[11063.67s -> 11064.39s]  That's a lie?
[11064.39s -> 11067.35s]  Do people actually get sponsored by Blizzard?
[11067.99s -> 11070.82s]  I'm just going with seven.
[11072.50s -> 11076.71s]  Blizzard pays people to play this game.
[11077.70s -> 11078.50s]  Not like tournaments,
[11078.50s -> 11079.94s]  like actually just to stream it.
[11079.94s -> 11093.40s]  Oh, it means single player.
[11100.14s -> 11104.06s]  I just jumped immediately to conclusions on that one.
[11104.62s -> 11111.08s]  Did you use the Twitch bounty?
[11111.08s -> 11112.84s]  No, no, I don't, I don't, I don't.
[11112.84s -> 11115.80s]  No, I did this because I'm a fucking moron.
[11115.80s -> 11118.76s]  And this is my own dumb decision.
[11118.76s -> 11120.60s]  I'm going to own my own shitty decisions.
[11121.16s -> 11122.20s]  This is a good decision.
[11122.84s -> 11124.42s]  Plus, I win.
[11124.42s -> 11126.74s]  The game's over.
[11126.74s -> 11128.76s]  Eight, nine, not yet.
[11129.40s -> 11132.71s]  Is that a beast?
[11136.71s -> 11137.99s]  Do the bounty now.
[11137.99s -> 11138.79s]  There is no...
[11138.79s -> 11140.63s]  I don't have a bounty for Hearthstone.
[11144.02s -> 11146.10s]  How does that not have a bounty for Hearthstone?
[11166.86s -> 11170.06s]  Yeah, I don't have a bounty, a bounty for Hearthstone.
[11170.06s -> 11181.90s]  Well, I can't do this yet.
[11181.90s -> 11182.86s]  Oh, we get to do this.
[11191.38s -> 11195.66s]  Next turn, we get to win.
[11203.66s -> 11204.38s]  Quest?
[11204.38s -> 11205.18s]  That's going to be too late.
[11206.60s -> 11207.32s]  Why not now?
[11209.56s -> 11214.17s]  Nobody died?
[11214.81s -> 11215.61s]  Freeze an enemy?
[11225.45s -> 11226.57s]  Well, now I'm going to do this.
[11232.52s -> 11233.08s]  Never mind.
[11239.58s -> 11240.62s]  Shuffle it back in.
[11242.20s -> 11242.92s]  Twin spell?
[11243.86s -> 11244.98s]  Quest now.
[11244.98s -> 11245.78s]  Twin spell.
[11245.78s -> 11246.82s]  Make it so I stay alive.
[11267.50s -> 11268.86s]  No, that's too much spell damage.
[11268.86s -> 11269.74s]  You don't have anything in your hand.
[11272.81s -> 11273.91s]  Nothing.
[11273.91s -> 11274.15s]  Yes.
[11275.27s -> 11275.67s]  All right.
[11276.31s -> 11281.10s]  Oh, come on.
[11281.10s -> 11282.78s]  Hit me in the face fucking five times.
[11286.87s -> 11287.83s]  That was so dumb.
[11288.79s -> 11289.35s]  Oh, God.
[11290.55s -> 11292.07s]  Your minions cost one.
[11292.07s -> 11293.03s]  Now, well, that's good.
[11293.59s -> 11294.23s]  I'm glad.
[11305.96s -> 11307.48s]  Yeah, it's a guaranteed victory.
[11309.96s -> 11311.80s]  Unless you pyroblast me or something, somehow.
[11316.04s -> 11316.92s]  Am I going to lose?
[11316.92s -> 11317.16s]  No.
[11318.04s -> 11318.76s]  I just won.
[11324.39s -> 11331.45s]  Oh, yeah.
[11332.33s -> 11334.57s]  I always have to do the BN on the computer because it doesn't matter.
[11339.29s -> 11340.33s]  Heroic isn't that bad.
[11341.85s -> 11346.49s]  The enemy's fatigued because he's so slow.
[11346.49s -> 11347.37s]  But I play slow.
[11347.93s -> 11349.45s]  What are we thinking?
[11353.56s -> 11358.12s]  50 damage to guaranteed win and a random one out of 30 chance.
[11359.56s -> 11363.08s]  Or add three random cards to your hand and they all cost zero.
[11363.08s -> 11364.44s]  That's fucking incredible.
[11365.24s -> 11368.62s]  Deal four damage to all minions and you shuffle it back in.
[11368.62s -> 11369.34s]  These are all good.
[11370.06s -> 11372.38s]  But you're going to make me pick the meme card.
[11372.38s -> 11381.26s]  So all enemy minions.
[11381.26s -> 11382.94s]  And it's a death rattle and we get it twice.
[11382.94s -> 11384.86s]  You really want me to do the joke card?
[11386.06s -> 11387.58s]  We're not going to see that the whole rest of the run.
[11388.70s -> 11396.42s]  Oh, goddamn it.
[11396.42s -> 11397.62s]  Why do the clicks do this?
[11402.57s -> 11404.01s]  There's been like five...
[11404.01s -> 11405.29s]  I'm not changing any settings.
[11405.29s -> 11407.45s]  There's been like 5,000 clicks.
[11407.45s -> 11408.09s]  You can't...
[11408.09s -> 11408.49s]  No.
[11408.49s -> 11409.85s]  Ah, whatever.
[11409.85s -> 11420.68s]  That's all right.
[11420.68s -> 11421.40s]  Elder won.
[11422.04s -> 11422.68s]  Yeah.
[11422.68s -> 11423.64s]  Elder is still winning.
[11425.27s -> 11427.19s]  I mean, that's amazing.
[11429.82s -> 11431.26s]  Or that, too, is so good.
[11432.06s -> 11432.62s]  All right.
[11432.62s -> 11433.98s]  The people have spoken.
[11433.98s -> 11438.76s]  The muscle is probably the best card here.
[11439.48s -> 11440.44s]  But Elder, that...
[11441.16s -> 11442.63s]  I mean, come on.
[11442.63s -> 11443.67s]  That's unbelievable.
[11444.47s -> 11450.68s]  Please continue to make your selection.
[11450.68s -> 11452.36s]  Big friends, pharaoh, bite, or legends?
[11456.95s -> 11457.99s]  Two avianas.
[11458.55s -> 11460.18s]  Aviana?
[11460.18s -> 11461.78s]  I don't really like aviana.
[11461.78s -> 11463.83s]  You have to wait till the very end of the game
[11465.06s -> 11469.05s]  to be able to throw up shit all over your board.
[11469.05s -> 11470.33s]  You already lost at that point.
[11472.22s -> 11473.34s]  Big bad arc mage.
[11474.14s -> 11478.17s]  That's pretty good.
[11478.81s -> 11483.62s]  Some of the five, five ironhide runt.
[11484.26s -> 11486.62s]  Two bites.
[11486.62s -> 11487.42s]  That's not bad either.
[11487.42s -> 11489.59s]  These are all good.
[11489.59s -> 11490.55s]  Cenarius is good.
[11490.55s -> 11491.75s]  Lowethep is really good.
[11491.75s -> 11492.47s]  I remember Lowethep.
[11492.47s -> 11493.51s]  He was like one of the best cards.
[11494.15s -> 11495.40s]  All right.
[11495.40s -> 11497.40s]  We're going to go with big friends.
[11503.45s -> 11504.25s]  Bite sucks.
[11508.97s -> 11509.85s]  Is bite bad?
[11515.03s -> 11515.83s]  Hey, welcome.
[11516.39s -> 11517.19s]  I can do better than that.
[11517.19s -> 11517.83s]  No, that's...
[11517.83s -> 11518.87s]  I shouldn't even...
[11518.87s -> 11519.35s]  Just stop.
[11520.15s -> 11520.55s]  Just stop.
[11520.55s -> 11521.03s]  You gotta...
[11521.03s -> 11522.39s]  Sometimes you gotta take the fucking loss.
[11523.11s -> 11527.32s]  What do you guys think?
[11527.96s -> 11532.04s]  I only get to do...
[11532.04s -> 11532.28s]  What?
[11533.16s -> 11534.68s]  I can only do...
[11535.40s -> 11540.58s]  Oh, it's because it's heroic.
[11541.70s -> 11544.49s]  Choose an enemy minion and add it to your deck
[11544.49s -> 11546.65s]  or give a friendly minion plus two plus two.
[11546.65s -> 11547.29s]  Just do them both.
[11547.85s -> 11548.41s]  Doesn't matter.
[11550.42s -> 11552.02s]  Or remove somebody from the deck.
[11552.58s -> 11556.66s]  I think you guys are clicking in the middle.
[11559.40s -> 11560.36s]  No, you're not.
[11560.36s -> 11561.72s]  You're doing recruit.
[11562.36s -> 11564.89s]  I mean, we can do them all.
[11565.69s -> 11566.94s]  All right.
[11566.94s -> 11567.10s]  Let's...
[11567.10s -> 11567.82s]  I'll make this easier.
[11567.82s -> 11568.94s]  Let me start from the left.
[11568.94s -> 11571.02s]  Because I mean, we're gonna probably do them all.
[11571.02s -> 11573.50s]  So forget about this.
[11574.06s -> 11575.02s]  Be easier this way.
[11577.72s -> 11577.88s]  So...
[11580.44s -> 11583.56s]  Who do you want me to recruit?
[11583.56s -> 11586.25s]  We've got giant anaconda.
[11586.25s -> 11587.61s]  Duskfallen Aviana.
[11587.61s -> 11589.61s]  Aviana, like evil Aviana.
[11589.86s -> 11590.82s]  That's like dark pit.
[11591.94s -> 11593.86s]  Kel'thuzad and then Ragnaros.
[11593.86s -> 11595.38s]  So who would you like me to do that to?
[11595.94s -> 11598.71s]  That's a better question.
[11598.71s -> 11600.47s]  How to beat you?
[11600.47s -> 11608.14s]  And no, I cannot take the innkeeper.
[11608.14s -> 11622.47s]  Seems to be a split between Kel'thuzad and Ragnaros
[11622.47s -> 11625.40s]  and the innkeeper because I said the word.
[11625.40s -> 11630.58s]  I said the word innkeeper and everyone's like hand
[11630.58s -> 11638.17s]  just Ouija board over to his face.
[11638.17s -> 11639.61s]  So it looks like it's gonna be Kel'thuzad.
[11640.57s -> 11641.05s]  All right.
[11641.93s -> 11643.96s]  Thank you for voting.
[11644.60s -> 11649.77s]  Kel'thuzad is coming with us.
[11650.41s -> 11654.81s]  All right.
[11654.81s -> 11656.81s]  Now, who do you want me to give?
[11656.81s -> 11661.86s]  Plus one, plus one, two.
[11661.86s -> 11664.25s]  Well, plus...
[11664.25s -> 11665.05s]  No, who do you want to get?
[11665.05s -> 11667.21s]  Plus two, plus two, two.
[11667.21s -> 11680.55s]  Who do you want me to give plus two, plus two, two?
[11680.55s -> 11681.83s]  Feral gib?
[11682.39s -> 11683.78s]  Astral tiger.
[11683.78s -> 11685.54s]  I mean, that's three, three, one drop.
[11685.54s -> 11686.26s]  That's pretty good.
[11686.90s -> 11695.62s]  That would also be a five, seven astral tiger,
[11695.62s -> 11696.34s]  which is insane.
[11702.04s -> 11702.92s]  Three, three, one drop.
[11702.92s -> 11704.20s]  That multiplies.
[11704.20s -> 11704.76s]  Yeah, that's true.
[11704.76s -> 11705.40s]  That's really good.
[11706.63s -> 11707.27s]  All right.
[11707.27s -> 11711.75s]  For the story before, it's a good one.
[11711.75s -> 11712.78s]  Okay.
[11713.58s -> 11714.78s]  Do you want me to remove anyone?
[11715.34s -> 11720.06s]  Do we still want to do that?
[11722.73s -> 11723.21s]  You know, let's...
[11723.21s -> 11723.69s]  Okay, click.
[11723.69s -> 11724.09s]  You know, who...
[11725.13s -> 11726.09s]  Are we removing anybody?
[11728.57s -> 11729.29s]  I don't think so.
[11729.93s -> 11730.65s]  I don't think so.
[11732.81s -> 11734.73s]  I think these, they all have a place here.
[11735.29s -> 11736.58s]  The death rattles.
[11736.58s -> 11737.22s]  No, we can't...
[11737.22s -> 11738.66s]  No, I'm not getting rid of any of these.
[11739.91s -> 11742.07s]  I'm not gonna remove me.
[11743.03s -> 11745.19s]  Replace the streamer with a better streamer.
[11750.60s -> 11751.16s]  No, we're good.
[11751.80s -> 11752.92s]  These are all death rattles.
[11754.89s -> 11755.85s]  Why won't it work?
[11756.49s -> 11760.14s]  Let's go.
[11768.31s -> 11770.95s]  Once you say it, Twitch repeats it.
[11776.22s -> 11779.34s]  Whenever a player plays a coin, draw a card.
[11779.98s -> 11783.13s]  I'm gonna forget about that.
[11783.13s -> 11784.57s]  I'm gonna give him so much money.
[11785.29s -> 11798.22s]  I just realized...
[11798.86s -> 11805.64s]  These kobolds just look like human skin alligators.
[11806.12s -> 11814.01s]  It's weird, right?
[11814.01s -> 11816.28s]  All right, I don't want that.
[11818.49s -> 11820.65s]  We're gonna actually hold on to the quest this time.
[11820.65s -> 11822.33s]  Give me some low cost, please.
[11831.19s -> 11831.75s]  That's okay.
[11833.29s -> 11834.17s]  All right.
[11834.17s -> 11836.98s]  Whenever a player plays a coin, draw a card.
[11837.62s -> 11842.98s]  So I'm assuming he's gonna give me coins.
[11846.66s -> 11847.46s]  Definitely gonna do this.
[11851.46s -> 11854.90s]  I think I popped the treasure once.
[11860.90s -> 11862.90s]  Is this guy gonna play a card?
[11866.78s -> 11867.34s]  There it is.
[11868.06s -> 11870.42s]  Why would you play that now?
[11871.46s -> 11871.86s]  It's gone.
[11875.96s -> 11876.20s]  Right?
[11877.00s -> 11877.64s]  Why would you do that?
[11889.19s -> 11889.51s]  Shit!
[11898.31s -> 11899.67s]  He's gonna give me two coins.
[11905.29s -> 11905.85s]  Send it back.
[11908.09s -> 11908.73s]  I'll take the coins.
[11908.73s -> 11909.53s]  I don't give a shit.
[11909.53s -> 11910.09s]  Send it back.
[11911.82s -> 11915.96s]  I gotta get two of them.
[11915.96s -> 11921.51s]  Look at all that.
[11931.16s -> 11931.96s]  No, I'm not gonna coin.
[11935.80s -> 11939.99s]  This guy's dead right now.
[11941.75s -> 11942.71s]  It's all right.
[11943.82s -> 11945.42s]  I'm gonna coin out Gruul.
[11945.42s -> 11946.62s]  I'm putting Gruul out right now.
[11951.34s -> 11956.14s]  Or coin out bone mare and give the taunt to the astral tiger.
[11963.05s -> 11963.61s]  I like that.
[11964.49s -> 11965.21s]  That sounds fun.
[11967.10s -> 11968.54s]  I can still kill questing adventure.
[11971.72s -> 11973.88s]  The coins are gonna grow questing.
[11973.88s -> 11974.20s]  Fuck.
[11986.65s -> 11987.13s]  They don't?
[11992.18s -> 11993.14s]  I was the one guy.
[11993.14s -> 11994.18s]  I was listening to the one guy.
[11995.06s -> 11996.14s]  Let's do this.
[12000.52s -> 12002.36s]  And I can kill questing and be fine.
[12003.24s -> 12003.56s]  All right.
[12003.56s -> 12004.44s]  Now we're in a good spot.
[12013.19s -> 12018.62s]  I'll take two tigers.
[12021.32s -> 12022.04s]  Overkill.
[12022.92s -> 12026.10s]  Well there's the big bad archmage.
[12030.84s -> 12036.26s]  I could do scribe or I could hit and kill
[12042.10s -> 12043.54s]  or bring out the direhorm.
[12049.64s -> 12050.92s]  Yeah, let's direhorm face.
[12051.56s -> 12063.93s]  And we get a coin.
[12065.13s -> 12066.01s]  Oh, fuck you.
[12069.24s -> 12069.56s]  Okay.
[12073.75s -> 12076.42s]  I think I gotta bring out Gruul.
[12076.42s -> 12077.38s]  I think I have to.
[12078.76s -> 12079.56s]  Or the scribe.
[12080.28s -> 12089.26s]  I can kill that with this, but then...
[12090.46s -> 12092.44s]  Yeah, we'll do this.
[12094.44s -> 12098.57s]  I have too many coins.
[12098.57s -> 12099.53s]  I need to get rid of these.
[12110.23s -> 12111.27s]  What did you just do?
[12111.27s -> 12111.91s]  What did he just do?
[12111.91s -> 12112.55s]  Did he vanish?
[12112.55s -> 12113.43s]  Why did you vanish?
[12113.99s -> 12114.87s]  This is heroic.
[12117.99s -> 12119.75s]  This is on heroic.
[12119.75s -> 12121.11s]  Oh, please.
[12121.11s -> 12122.15s]  Oh, please.
[12123.86s -> 12125.22s]  Oh, please.
[12126.02s -> 12127.06s]  I don't even care.
[12137.03s -> 12138.31s]  And here comes Barnum.
[12145.21s -> 12151.72s]  I didn't even know what was happening.
[12153.24s -> 12154.20s]  He summons...
[12154.20s -> 12156.12s]  Oh, he summons six cost minions.
[12163.06s -> 12164.74s]  Uh-oh, you had to get rid of Aviana.
[12165.46s -> 12168.54s]  It doesn't matter.
[12170.70s -> 12172.86s]  Reduce the cost of your minions in your deck to zero.
[12173.58s -> 12175.10s]  That's so stupid.
[12178.26s -> 12179.06s]  I mean, like, let's...
[12179.70s -> 12180.02s]  Okay.
[12186.94s -> 12187.66s]  Do I just win?
[12188.70s -> 12189.34s]  I just win.
[12189.98s -> 12191.90s]  But I want to see that, though.
[12191.90s -> 12192.38s]  That's fun.
[12193.30s -> 12194.58s]  I'll take him down to one health.
[12201.56s -> 12207.08s]  Yeah, that's dangerous.
[12207.08s -> 12207.56s]  Never mind.
[12210.38s -> 12211.66s]  Yeah, this is heroic.
[12212.46s -> 12212.78s]  I can't...
[12212.78s -> 12213.58s]  I don't want to fuck around.
[12214.46s -> 12219.38s]  That was awesome.
[12220.47s -> 12221.19s]  Just like that.
[12221.19s -> 12223.19s]  Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
[12223.19s -> 12224.07s]  That's what you live for.
[12232.76s -> 12233.32s]  Roar.
[12233.32s -> 12234.92s]  Beasts and buffs are big friends again.
[12235.48s -> 12242.87s]  Another Dire Horn.
[12242.87s -> 12244.73s]  Malorne.
[12244.73s -> 12246.09s]  That's just double.
[12246.89s -> 12248.17s]  Rush, overkill.
[12248.17s -> 12249.29s]  Summon a beast from your hand.
[12249.29s -> 12250.49s]  I don't really have any beasts.
[12250.49s -> 12251.37s]  I mean, I guess maybe.
[12256.02s -> 12258.74s]  Adapt means that every turn you get to do something else, right?
[12258.74s -> 12259.46s]  Or every...
[12259.46s -> 12263.14s]  You just change it to, like, divine shield, taunt, rush, right?
[12263.70s -> 12268.68s]  I do have a ton of beasts.
[12268.68s -> 12269.40s]  I guess I do.
[12269.40s -> 12269.80s]  All right.
[12269.80s -> 12270.36s]  Sounds good.
[12277.13s -> 12278.41s]  Banker Biggs.
[12279.29s -> 12282.52s]  Return a friendly minion to your hand.
[12282.52s -> 12285.88s]  Then give it plus four, plus four, and copy it.
[12288.84s -> 12290.52s]  That sounds kind of ridiculous.
[12291.32s -> 12301.54s]  How the hell are you supposed to deal with that?
[12317.98s -> 12318.54s]  Just play it.
[12321.80s -> 12322.04s]  Shit.
[12323.00s -> 12325.00s]  Oh, that's a disgusting, awful start.
[12328.74s -> 12329.70s]  Oh, yuck.
[12329.70s -> 12330.10s]  I lose.
[12338.42s -> 12341.30s]  I want to start really making money.
[12341.30s -> 12342.66s]  I'm calling security.
[12344.15s -> 12344.47s]  What?
[12344.47s -> 12344.79s]  What?
[12344.79s -> 12345.11s]  I didn't...
[12345.11s -> 12346.23s]  Why would you call security on me?
[12346.23s -> 12346.79s]  I didn't do anything.
[12346.79s -> 12347.35s]  This is bad.
[12352.71s -> 12353.51s]  I need these coins.
[12354.39s -> 12355.67s]  If I have my stand any chance.
[12363.50s -> 12364.22s]  I don't stand a chance.
[12364.22s -> 12365.18s]  I need the coins right now.
[12366.65s -> 12366.97s]  Die.
[12367.61s -> 12377.69s]  It's invader zoom.
[12383.32s -> 12383.64s]  All right.
[12385.05s -> 12386.01s]  Two and one.
[12386.01s -> 12386.97s]  No, that's bad.
[12386.97s -> 12387.85s]  That's not gonna work.
[12387.85s -> 12388.97s]  I have to just get the coins.
[12392.50s -> 12393.06s]  Or I could...
[12399.80s -> 12400.92s]  Tiger's not terrible here.
[12401.56s -> 12403.32s]  This is a gamble, but it might be all right.
[12431.16s -> 12432.76s]  Literally, what did that accomplish?
[12432.76s -> 12433.16s]  I don't...
[12434.52s -> 12435.24s]  Nothing.
[12435.24s -> 12436.28s]  I don't know why.
[12436.28s -> 12437.24s]  I just...
[12437.24s -> 12437.48s]  Some...
[12437.48s -> 12439.24s]  I looked over and I saw somebody say it.
[12439.96s -> 12440.44s]  No, I don't...
[12440.44s -> 12441.40s]  I can't use the coins enough.
[12441.40s -> 12442.20s]  Fuck.
[12442.20s -> 12444.14s]  I have to put something out here.
[12451.37s -> 12452.09s]  It was me.
[12453.45s -> 12454.17s]  What the fuck?
[12455.38s -> 12458.98s]  I forgot there's people that are writing things specifically.
[12458.98s -> 12460.50s]  So I'll look at it and then they'll go.
[12460.50s -> 12461.70s]  You might do it.
[12461.70s -> 12463.78s]  Oh, I need to focus on me.
[12467.61s -> 12469.77s]  Literally, what did that accomplish?
[12469.77s -> 12470.49s]  You're right.
[12470.49s -> 12470.97s]  Damn it.
[12472.12s -> 12472.44s]  Okay.
[12473.99s -> 12474.39s]  This is...
[12475.75s -> 12477.99s]  That's the best card in the whole game, right?
[12479.46s -> 12481.46s]  Isn't that the best current card?
[12481.46s -> 12482.82s]  Like the broken meta card?
[12486.95s -> 12488.39s]  Okay, I have two coins.
[12489.59s -> 12490.07s]  Seven.
[12490.07s -> 12494.60s]  I could do four and then twin spell them.
[12494.60s -> 12495.16s]  No.
[12495.16s -> 12496.04s]  I could do tiger.
[12496.84s -> 12506.20s]  Come on.
[12507.00s -> 12510.33s]  Was I gonna like draw that next?
[12510.33s -> 12511.61s]  Why do I keep pulling this?
[12512.25s -> 12521.22s]  I have to like coin and hit this.
[12523.86s -> 12525.99s]  Right?
[12525.99s -> 12527.51s]  I mean like this is horrible.
[12537.27s -> 12540.58s]  No, I mean just it takes the shield off.
[12540.58s -> 12542.42s]  So I don't get guaranteed.
[12545.10s -> 12545.82s]  I would do that.
[12546.94s -> 12547.74s]  That's what I would do.
[12548.62s -> 12549.26s]  That's what you would do.
[12549.26s -> 12550.46s]  I think that's what I would do as well.
[12555.85s -> 12556.41s]  Go face.
[12556.41s -> 12556.97s]  I don't...
[12556.97s -> 12557.53s]  I can't.
[12557.53s -> 12558.57s]  Oh, this is so bad.
[12560.33s -> 12560.81s]  Uh-oh.
[12566.76s -> 12568.60s]  Anonymous five community subs.
[12568.60s -> 12569.00s]  Thank you.
[12570.15s -> 12573.99s]  There were an insane amount of community subs tonight.
[12573.99s -> 12575.75s]  And somebody else just gave five more.
[12578.58s -> 12580.26s]  Thank you so much for the subs.
[12583.24s -> 12584.68s]  What the hell am I gonna do about this?
[12585.32s -> 12587.35s]  Chromagus?
[12588.07s -> 12596.52s]  Chromagus is probably the best thing I can do.
[12604.90s -> 12605.86s]  Or I could do...
[12605.86s -> 12607.94s]  I could wait, but I'm gonna take so much damage.
[12609.69s -> 12610.89s]  Next turn bring this out.
[12610.89s -> 12612.81s]  Kill somebody and summon Chromagus.
[12615.34s -> 12616.78s]  I'm just gonna have to pop the shield.
[12619.96s -> 12620.76s]  Pop shield.
[12622.63s -> 12623.19s]  Kill you.
[12624.58s -> 12625.70s]  Bring out the tiger.
[12626.42s -> 12632.54s]  Should I maybe just...
[12632.54s -> 12632.78s]  No.
[12637.56s -> 12638.04s]  That's the...
[12638.04s -> 12639.16s]  That's the dream right there.
[12639.16s -> 12639.72s]  If I can get it.
[12644.10s -> 12645.22s]  I need to draw that.
[12645.94s -> 12646.34s]  Right now.
[12646.90s -> 12648.42s]  That clears up everything.
[12656.04s -> 12656.44s]  Draw it.
[12656.44s -> 12656.76s]  Come on.
[12657.40s -> 12658.92s]  Top deck that cra...
[12658.92s -> 12660.12s]  Top deck the elder right now.
[12660.76s -> 12662.52s]  Top deck elder right now and I still have a chance.
[12663.32s -> 12667.80s]  Does that change things?
[12667.80s -> 12668.28s]  That might.
[12669.24s -> 12669.74s]  Ugh.
[12670.97s -> 12672.17s]  Coin bone mare?
[12674.39s -> 12681.40s]  Or coin coin rush into like you pull out...
[12681.80s -> 12690.14s]  Astro Rat.
[12690.14s -> 12691.90s]  I'll get Chromagus or Ironhide.
[12692.46s -> 12705.80s]  Just looking up your account number.
[12717.00s -> 12717.96s]  Who do I kill with this?
[12718.68s -> 12721.90s]  The 2-4 or the 4-3?
[12721.90s -> 12723.30s]  What?
[12723.30s -> 12724.18s]  Just go face.
[12724.18s -> 12725.22s]  You can't go face with the rush.
[12725.78s -> 12740.82s]  All right.
[12740.82s -> 12741.62s]  I got a chance.
[12741.62s -> 12742.98s]  Next turn I do...
[12742.98s -> 12743.70s]  This is all right.
[12754.54s -> 12757.10s]  Now we pull out bone mare and we go face.
[12757.82s -> 12758.89s]  Oh shit.
[12758.89s -> 12760.01s]  That thing's gonna have 4-4.
[12760.01s -> 12761.05s]  That's just gonna be horrible.
[12761.05s -> 12761.61s]  I gotta...
[12761.61s -> 12762.81s]  I have to start doing something now.
[12770.23s -> 12771.11s]  I mean, uh...
[12774.60s -> 12775.80s]  I gotta just go for the win.
[12776.36s -> 12777.16s]  And then I can do...
[12777.72s -> 12778.52s]  I can do this.
[12779.56s -> 12781.56s]  Oh no!
[12783.56s -> 12784.84s]  That's not good.
[12784.84s -> 12786.04s]  This is not good.
[12786.04s -> 12786.84s]  What can I get from this?
[12792.63s -> 12794.71s]  All right.
[12794.71s -> 12795.43s]  12, 13...
[12796.15s -> 12801.96s]  I can get a shitload of armor.
[12813.03s -> 12817.82s]  11, 12, 13, 14, 15.
[12819.80s -> 12820.52s]  Is it lethal?
[12843.22s -> 12844.10s]  3, 6.
[12847.62s -> 12849.06s]  I have to put chromagus out now
[12849.06s -> 12850.42s]  because I fucking didn't do it right.
[12851.30s -> 12864.58s]  That's 3, 6, 9, twin spell.
[12864.58s -> 12865.94s]  I have to clear somebody.
[12870.23s -> 12871.51s]  No, I can do it.
[12871.51s -> 12872.15s]  I can do it.
[12877.19s -> 12879.11s]  6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[12879.11s -> 12879.35s]  Don't...
[12880.15s -> 12880.39s]  No!
[12881.43s -> 12881.99s]  Hold on!
[12882.55s -> 12883.03s]  Hold on!
[12887.11s -> 12887.51s]  All right.
[12887.51s -> 12888.23s]  Now draw.
[12889.96s -> 12893.64s]  Can I do it?
[12893.64s -> 12895.32s]  Oh, you motherfucker.
[12895.32s -> 12897.00s]  If only he was the elder.
[12897.00s -> 12897.48s]  Hold on.
[12898.79s -> 12902.44s]  6, 7, 8, 9...
[12904.54s -> 12904.94s]  9...
[12905.98s -> 12906.46s]  No!
[12906.46s -> 12907.34s]  It's not enough.
[12916.66s -> 12917.54s]  Go for the roll.
[12929.06s -> 12929.46s]  Shit!
[12932.15s -> 12933.51s]  Oh no!
[12933.51s -> 12934.39s]  I had a chance.
[12934.95s -> 12935.51s]  You know what?
[12935.51s -> 12937.59s]  Fuck the RNG I got in the beginning.
[12937.59s -> 12939.11s]  I pulled the elder twice.
[12954.89s -> 12955.37s]  Wait a minute.
[12955.37s -> 12956.01s]  Wait a minute.
[12956.01s -> 12956.41s]  Wait a minute.
[12956.41s -> 12956.97s]  Do I get...
[12956.97s -> 12957.21s]  Hold on.
[12957.21s -> 12957.69s]  Do I live?
[12958.25s -> 12959.61s]  Do I live one more turn?
[12961.48s -> 12963.64s]  6, 12, 18...
[12963.64s -> 12964.52s]  Fuck you, game.
[12965.16s -> 12970.41s]  Oh, there he is.
[12971.13s -> 12971.85s]  Wait.
[12971.85s -> 12972.73s]  What?
[12972.73s -> 12975.02s]  I need him to die.
[12975.02s -> 12978.89s]  Maybe he'll be an idiot.
[12978.89s -> 13001.40s]  Maybe he won't kill me.
[13001.40s -> 13002.04s]  Damn it.
[13002.04s -> 13003.64s]  It was this thing that screwed me.
[13003.64s -> 13004.60s]  That's why I had to get rid of him.
[13004.60s -> 13005.00s]  Oh well.
[13016.66s -> 13018.42s]  Oh, I have to beat it.
[13018.42s -> 13019.14s]  I have to do it.
[13019.86s -> 13027.64s]  No, wait.
[13027.64s -> 13028.52s]  What's the tavern roll?
[13038.94s -> 13040.14s]  Nefarion Rises?
[13041.48s -> 13042.04s]  Oh no.
[13056.78s -> 13057.90s]  All right, let's do Anomaly.
[13058.62s -> 13060.18s]  Where is it?
[13060.74s -> 13061.46s]  Oh.
[13061.46s -> 13063.82s]  Which one of these is it?
[13065.14s -> 13066.10s]  Is it this one?
[13066.10s -> 13069.27s]  Which one of these is Anomaly?
[13069.27s -> 13072.70s]  Oh, it's above go.
[13074.94s -> 13075.74s]  Anomaly mode.
[13075.74s -> 13078.46s]  Gain a random effect for this run.
[13078.46s -> 13081.42s]  Minions gain plus 1 plus 1 at the end of their owner's turn.
[13082.14s -> 13085.94s]  So it was just random every time?
[13086.58s -> 13091.26s]  That makes it easy, right?
[13091.26s -> 13092.62s]  Ah, I don't want to do that.
[13092.62s -> 13101.75s]  It's random every run.
[13102.31s -> 13103.53s]  Anomaly is a little easier.
[13104.25s -> 13108.10s]  It works for them.
[13108.10s -> 13109.46s]  All minions get it.
[13109.46s -> 13110.26s]  Oh shit.
[13110.26s -> 13110.76s]  Okay.
[13116.20s -> 13116.76s]  Let's try...
[13117.88s -> 13119.88s]  Let's try that.
[13119.88s -> 13121.64s]  Let's do Heroic on here.
[13121.64s -> 13123.51s]  Let's pick a new class.
[13148.28s -> 13149.08s]  Mage.
[13150.81s -> 13152.17s]  Sounds good to me.
[13152.17s -> 13155.93s]  Gonna be Fireman.
[13155.93s -> 13159.64s]  Okay.
[13159.64s -> 13160.20s]  Easy enough.
[13160.20s -> 13168.78s]  Thank you.
[13168.78s -> 13169.50s]  Fire Blast.
[13170.82s -> 13172.02s]  Can only do Apprentice.
[13172.58s -> 13175.51s]  What's my favorite class?
[13175.51s -> 13178.55s]  It was Paladin when I played years ago.
[13179.19s -> 13184.49s]  All right, Alchemist Wendy.
[13184.49s -> 13185.29s]  We did this already.
[13192.06s -> 13195.35s]  The deck that I used to play when I attempted...
[13195.99s -> 13202.04s]  ...was the Silverhand Knight deck.
[13203.48s -> 13207.48s]  Where you had that guy that gave everybody 3-3 and it was pretty fun.
[13209.30s -> 13209.62s]  All right.
[13210.66s -> 13211.62s]  This is different stuff.
[13215.98s -> 13216.54s]  Sickening.
[13218.12s -> 13219.40s]  Yeah, it was Agro Pally, right?
[13220.04s -> 13225.43s]  So this one, this was in there.
[13226.87s -> 13228.15s]  Your Murlocs cost 1.
[13230.71s -> 13232.14s]  Draw two cards.
[13232.46s -> 13234.30s]  Uh, destroy it.
[13237.56s -> 13238.04s]  That's fine.
[13244.41s -> 13247.61s]  Was that the deck that was so used that bots could get a high rank with it?
[13247.61s -> 13248.17s]  I don't know.
[13254.63s -> 13255.11s]  It was.
[13257.61s -> 13258.09s]  Whatever.
[13261.00s -> 13262.04s]  Deal 2 damage.
[13262.04s -> 13263.56s]  Add a 1-1 elemental.
[13263.56s -> 13264.84s]  I'm gonna say we just get the...
[13265.72s -> 13267.82s]  Could just kill it.
[13267.82s -> 13269.54s]  Or bring out the Fairy Dragon.
[13271.21s -> 13273.69s]  I would put out the Fairy Dragon right here.
[13276.58s -> 13277.70s]  Or I would do that and skip.
[13278.42s -> 13281.62s]  No, it was Secret Paladin.
[13281.62s -> 13282.26s]  Yeah.
[13282.26s -> 13283.06s]  That wasn't that one.
[13284.49s -> 13285.69s]  Uh...
[13285.69s -> 13296.98s]  Chaos.
[13296.98s -> 13297.38s]  Chaos.
[13297.38s -> 13298.26s]  Why are you saying chaos?
[13299.54s -> 13307.22s]  Oh, because of Jebel.
[13308.58s -> 13310.94s]  One more turn and I get Scargill.
[13311.58s -> 13317.83s]  Well, I can do...
[13323.45s -> 13324.17s]  Eh.
[13324.17s -> 13325.26s]  Eh.
[13329.64s -> 13330.92s]  I would just kill him and hit him in the face.
[13332.44s -> 13334.04s]  Or you could do Salus to Secret and...
[13335.08s -> 13336.52s]  I can whack him, you know?
[13356.38s -> 13361.21s]  Thanks for the dubs.
[13362.01s -> 13363.05s]  Thanks for the doubles.
[13365.46s -> 13366.18s]  Stupid.
[13367.22s -> 13370.31s]  Now that gets me this for free.
[13371.11s -> 13381.05s]  Free 2 damage, but does that really do much for me?
[13381.05s -> 13382.73s]  I got my dubs!
[13382.73s -> 13383.37s]  Doubles!
[13384.01s -> 13389.80s]  That didn't really do much for me, though.
[13399.16s -> 13400.52s]  I mean, like, fucking die.
[13400.52s -> 13401.00s]  Who cares?
[13405.45s -> 13406.33s]  Checked.
[13406.33s -> 13407.88s]  Check him.
[13407.88s -> 13409.00s]  What does checked mean?
[13410.04s -> 13410.84s]  Like, checkmate?
[13412.12s -> 13412.36s]  Yeah.
[13413.50s -> 13414.62s]  Checkmate, motherfucker.
[13415.26s -> 13417.21s]  Does that suck?
[13420.17s -> 13422.68s]  Am I gonna lose?
[13423.48s -> 13428.20s]  No.
[13428.20s -> 13428.76s]  Earthen Ring.
[13446.49s -> 13446.97s]  What's that?
[13447.61s -> 13450.76s]  Whenever your spells deal damage, restore that much health to your hero.
[13457.64s -> 13462.22s]  Okay.
[13462.22s -> 13466.84s]  Well, we're gonna polymorph you.
[13467.80s -> 13469.85s]  And then we're gonna kill you.
[13471.34s -> 13472.54s]  Just like this, I'll show you.
[13472.54s -> 13473.90s]  It's gonna be so easy.
[13476.22s -> 13477.18s]  What am I doing?
[13477.18s -> 13477.98s]  Yeah, that's what I want to do.
[13492.22s -> 13492.54s]  Freeze.
[13492.54s -> 13501.66s]  I can do it too.
[13502.38s -> 13502.62s]  See?
[13504.71s -> 13505.35s]  I'm gonna lose.
[13506.23s -> 13510.07s]  No, I'm not.
[13510.07s -> 13516.70s]  It's Calcigos!
[13517.34s -> 13519.26s]  Your first spell each turn costs zero.
[13521.14s -> 13522.26s]  Uh, I want this.
[13522.26s -> 13526.02s]  It's impossible to lose at this point.
[13527.67s -> 13528.87s]  Let me tell you something.
[13533.11s -> 13533.75s]  It's possible.
[13541.88s -> 13543.29s]  It's possible.
[13543.29s -> 13544.81s]  It's very possible now.
[13545.85s -> 13551.00s]  Well, actually not anymore.
[13551.00s -> 13552.44s]  Yeah, it's not possible anymore.
[13565.02s -> 13565.74s]  You can't hurt me.
[13565.74s -> 13566.38s]  I'm immune.
[13570.87s -> 13572.39s]  Wait, I want him to die.
[13572.39s -> 13572.87s]  Watch this.
[13573.67s -> 13583.64s]  Level up.
[13583.64s -> 13585.32s]  And I got a golden mirror image.
[13585.32s -> 13592.07s]  Cool.
[13592.07s -> 13592.95s]  Some good ones here.
[13593.59s -> 13601.82s]  Play Classic WoW.
[13601.82s -> 13603.86s]  I don't have access to it.
[13603.86s -> 13607.85s]  I told you guys that eventually when I got access to it,
[13609.45s -> 13612.01s]  I was gonna try to just beat Molten Core with Chat.
[13612.65s -> 13615.70s]  But I mean, that would take months.
[13616.42s -> 13618.84s]  Where are you guys clicking?
[13618.84s -> 13625.30s]  Your minions that cost five or more cost five.
[13625.30s -> 13626.74s]  You can use your hero power twice each turn.
[13626.74s -> 13628.82s]  It costs one or death rattles.
[13629.38s -> 13632.50s]  So all the minions that are five or more just cost five.
[13633.22s -> 13639.48s]  Dude, you're never even gonna get to level 60.
[13639.48s -> 13640.12s]  Who are you kidding?
[13640.76s -> 13645.30s]  All right.
[13645.30s -> 13646.42s]  We need big minions now.
[13653.18s -> 13654.70s]  Babbling book we got.
[13654.70s -> 13655.66s]  What do we got for minions?
[13657.02s -> 13657.66s]  Calcigos.
[13669.98s -> 13671.58s]  Where do you want me to go here?
[13672.90s -> 13673.46s]  Can I ask?
[13675.30s -> 13678.50s]  24% of everybody that's clicking the screen.
[13678.50s -> 13679.64s]  Where do you want me to go?
[13685.27s -> 13685.99s]  Quit the game?
[13694.47s -> 13695.43s]  No, this is what we're doing.
[13697.21s -> 13698.81s]  Cooking simulator tomorrow.
[13698.81s -> 13700.87s]  Because it actually releases.
[13700.87s -> 13707.19s]  No, I'm not going to start here as it might magic through now.
[13708.62s -> 13712.12s]  No, this is a Hearthstone comfortable stream.
[13712.12s -> 13713.21s]  Didn't I just?
[13713.21s -> 13714.57s]  Dude, why am I doing this twice in a row?
[13719.77s -> 13720.65s]  Play Constructed?
[13723.50s -> 13724.46s]  I can't do that.
[13728.74s -> 13729.54s]  After Arena.
[13729.54s -> 13732.50s]  It was it was an absolute disaster.
[13732.50s -> 13734.02s]  I will try Arena one more time.
[13739.38s -> 13741.54s]  Getting deja vu, but I don't mind this start.
[13742.66s -> 13754.55s]  Should I start doing Bane?
[13755.59s -> 13757.83s]  But to get chat under control?
[13759.48s -> 13760.44s]  Do viewer games?
[13761.00s -> 13765.37s]  Can you do viewer games?
[13766.41s -> 13768.90s]  Wouldn't I have to like add a bunch of people on battle net?
[13769.78s -> 13770.66s]  I don't think you can do that.
[13770.66s -> 13770.98s]  Can you?
[13775.99s -> 13777.43s]  I have to add everybody on battle net.
[13777.99s -> 13785.11s]  All right, what do I want to do?
[13786.07s -> 13790.15s]  I want to after you cast a spell do one damage to a random enemy minion.
[13790.95s -> 13797.16s]  That sounds pretty good.
[13797.16s -> 13798.60s]  Make a guild in Classic WoW.
[13798.60s -> 13799.32s]  I was thinking about it.
[13804.50s -> 13811.18s]  What do I think about Magic Gathering?
[13811.18s -> 13812.70s]  It's too complicated for me.
[13813.42s -> 13814.70s]  It's just too much for me.
[13814.70s -> 13816.06s]  I can barely handle Hearthstone.
[13816.70s -> 13818.87s]  All right, so here we go.
[13818.87s -> 13819.19s]  Ready?
[13819.19s -> 13819.83s]  I'm going for it.
[13823.88s -> 13824.20s]  Yep.
[13825.83s -> 13826.55s]  It worked.
[13838.84s -> 13839.72s]  Too complicated.
[13839.72s -> 13840.84s]  Yeah, it just kind of is.
[13850.79s -> 13855.59s]  So a game like Hearthstone I can obviously just
[13855.59s -> 13857.11s]  dick around and play it like once in a while.
[13858.15s -> 13864.68s]  But yeah, you kind of know what you're doing in Magic the Gathering.
[13865.40s -> 13866.76s]  You need to know a lot, don't you?
[13869.50s -> 13870.54s]  Should I bring out?
[13870.54s -> 13871.82s]  Let's just get a magic trick.
[13872.78s -> 13880.74s]  I mean, just do that now.
[13880.74s -> 13882.34s]  Maybe I'll get another free one.
[13883.06s -> 13897.42s]  You have to learn the basics, but Magic Gathering Arena is autopilot.
[13897.42s -> 13898.30s]  Just autopilot.
[13903.35s -> 13906.63s]  You're not going to attack me, huh?
[13909.94s -> 13911.22s]  Well, there's Kelsagos.
[13913.98s -> 13914.30s]  I can.
[13914.30s -> 13914.86s]  All right, here we go.
[13914.86s -> 13915.42s]  Watch this.
[13915.42s -> 13917.18s]  Your first spell each turn causes zero.
[13924.44s -> 13925.08s]  Three damage.
[13925.08s -> 13927.48s]  Freeze the character if I was to freeze the minion if it's already frozen.
[13927.48s -> 13927.88s]  Destroy it.
[13927.88s -> 13928.28s]  This one.
[13929.00s -> 13934.36s]  And then we're going to sheep you and face.
[13936.12s -> 13941.88s]  Thanks for the free spells, Kelsagos.
[13952.09s -> 13955.94s]  Yeah, for the most part, the last couple of streams have really just been
[13958.63s -> 13960.07s]  I needed low-key stuff.
[13960.07s -> 13961.91s]  And I mean, we've been dicking around and I've been making
[13962.79s -> 13965.91s]  fucking loud noises, but I really was supposed to take it easy.
[13968.02s -> 13971.37s]  So tomorrow we're going to be doing cooking simulator.
[13972.01s -> 13975.85s]  So don't worry.
[13975.85s -> 13976.65s]  I think I win.
[13977.88s -> 13979.64s]  Four, five, six, seven, eight.
[13983.37s -> 13984.01s]  Nine, ten.
[13984.01s -> 13985.29s]  I could get good RNG here.
[13985.85s -> 13986.73s]  Here we go.
[13986.73s -> 13987.99s]  I'm just going to, who cares?
[13994.38s -> 13994.94s]  Is that it?
[13995.50s -> 13997.26s]  Four, five, six, seven, eight.
[13997.26s -> 13997.76s]  Ah!
[14013.13s -> 14014.25s]  Am I going to play Dreams again?
[14016.39s -> 14020.49s]  Yeah, I'll probably play Dreams once I hook up the PS4 again.
[14022.82s -> 14025.30s]  Because at that point, oh, he just goes for his first spell.
[14025.86s -> 14030.70s]  Um, once we have something else to do on PS4.
[14030.70s -> 14033.82s]  Because by this point, I think there's a lot more stuff in Dreams.
[14034.70s -> 14035.20s]  So yeah.
[14036.78s -> 14037.42s]  I think so.
[14038.30s -> 14048.34s]  Yeah, we've played it a few times already.
[14048.90s -> 14050.50s]  It's really, really fun.
[14050.50s -> 14053.34s]  It's really interesting.
[14053.34s -> 14054.38s]  It's fun just to channel surf.
[14061.16s -> 14064.28s]  Well, yeah, we kind of have to go big because these will all be five cost.
[14068.54s -> 14069.50s]  Go big.
[14069.50s -> 14071.02s]  100% click.
[14071.02s -> 14071.58s]  Look at that.
[14076.36s -> 14083.42s]  Oh, I also have to check on my, um, I'm going to check on the, um, what is it though?
[14085.18s -> 14087.58s]  Didn't I release the worm to the public?
[14088.30s -> 14089.98s]  I wonder if anybody did anything with it.
[14089.98s -> 14091.18s]  All healing is doubled.
[14092.22s -> 14096.92s]  What's wrong?
[14101.64s -> 14103.86s]  Hey, what's wrong?
[14103.86s -> 14104.50s]  What's going on here?
[14106.68s -> 14107.16s]  You all right?
[14108.92s -> 14112.25s]  That was weird.
[14112.25s -> 14118.84s]  They having server trouble?
[14125.83s -> 14126.47s]  The worm.
[14134.71s -> 14135.67s]  Ban for BM.
[14135.67s -> 14136.07s]  Who, me?
[14136.07s -> 14138.79s]  Who are you referring to?
[14139.51s -> 14147.06s]  Try to say 3095C because I was supposed to delete that at a thousand.
[14150.07s -> 14151.19s]  I need a new number now.
[14152.97s -> 14157.88s]  Do I have any elementals?
[14162.82s -> 14164.74s]  I don't think there's any elementals even in the whole deck.
[14165.38s -> 14169.18s]  I guess the flame geyser will make one or two.
[14184.02s -> 14185.46s]  Double healing.
[14186.02s -> 14186.82s]  Not going to play a card.
[14186.82s -> 14188.02s]  All right, I'll just take it.
[14188.02s -> 14188.52s]  Fine.
[14189.06s -> 14194.18s]  All right, let me, let me summon an elemental.
[14195.85s -> 14197.05s]  That's an elemental, isn't it?
[14197.69s -> 14200.79s]  This is an elemental, right?
[14202.55s -> 14203.03s]  It's not.
[14204.23s -> 14204.95s]  Oh, shit.
[14210.30s -> 14211.18s]  This is an elemental.
[14211.18s -> 14211.90s]  Arcane Anomaly.
[14211.90s -> 14212.94s]  Should I just get it out there?
[14218.12s -> 14218.84s]  Read the card.
[14218.84s -> 14220.92s]  Well, I know, I just saw like the fucking goo.
[14235.94s -> 14237.38s]  Eight health to all minions.
[14240.73s -> 14242.97s]  All right, I'm going to have a pretty big hand for this.
[14243.77s -> 14249.14s]  I'm just going to go face and then next turn have like a huge minion
[14260.47s -> 14261.11s]  because that will be
[14263.48s -> 14265.32s]  one, two, three, four, five, six.
[14265.32s -> 14266.60s]  It'll be a seven cost minion.
[14272.41s -> 14276.18s]  Do I get this?
[14276.18s -> 14276.90s]  No, yeah, next turn.
[14276.90s -> 14277.62s]  What is it?
[14277.62s -> 14278.18s]  It's a taunt.
[14279.35s -> 14279.99s]  All right, here we go.
[14280.63s -> 14281.99s]  Seven cost minion incoming.
[14287.66s -> 14288.86s]  Oh, damn it.
[14291.51s -> 14293.67s]  Oh, they're going to kill it right now too.
[14293.67s -> 14294.07s]  Shit.
[14294.07s -> 14294.47s]  Oh well.
[14306.02s -> 14310.02s]  What does he get from this?
[14316.95s -> 14318.15s]  I know you're going to kill it.
[14318.15s -> 14319.75s]  Yeah, I don't get to see the fun thing.
[14321.78s -> 14323.54s]  I get a taunt now and we can do it again.
[14324.42s -> 14327.59s]  Give me something else.
[14331.30s -> 14331.62s]  All right.
[14347.02s -> 14348.14s]  Maybe I don't even do anything.
[14350.62s -> 14351.90s]  What is the rewards thing?
[14352.78s -> 14353.90s]  Freudian weapon.
[14353.90s -> 14354.38s]  Cheer.
[14354.38s -> 14356.46s]  Shared rewards to three others in chat.
[14356.46s -> 14357.02s]  What happened?
[14361.64s -> 14362.44s]  What does that actually do?
[14373.78s -> 14374.66s]  Share rewards.
[14375.22s -> 14376.58s]  I have no idea.
[14376.58s -> 14387.16s]  Oh, he's going to inspire.
[14388.12s -> 14390.42s]  I get two of these things, man.
[14391.46s -> 14392.98s]  Really?
[14396.49s -> 14398.41s]  Well, now we fire lands.
[14399.21s -> 14408.68s]  God, kill somebody.
[14409.40s -> 14416.20s]  Any elementals in the hand?
[14416.20s -> 14416.44s]  No.
[14422.01s -> 14422.33s]  Six.
[14425.13s -> 14426.09s]  What is this game?
[14436.15s -> 14438.71s]  All right, got a taunt restore eight health to your hero.
[14438.71s -> 14439.43s]  That's pretty good.
[14439.43s -> 14441.19s]  We can just take one damage at a time.
[14442.07s -> 14444.15s]  I can cast a spell.
[14444.15s -> 14445.75s]  We get one damage to a random enemy.
[14449.02s -> 14450.47s]  We're just going to go with the face.
[14451.11s -> 14455.77s]  Whenever this attacks and kills a minion,
[14455.77s -> 14456.89s]  summon two murlocs for me.
[14456.89s -> 14458.57s]  I don't have any murlocs in my deck.
[14458.57s -> 14464.12s]  I mean, just do this.
[14470.92s -> 14471.72s]  I don't want that here.
[14472.44s -> 14473.00s]  Murlocs?
[14473.80s -> 14474.52s]  No, I don't have any.
[14476.20s -> 14480.54s]  What's my voice?
[14480.54s -> 14481.34s]  Am I eating something?
[14481.34s -> 14482.30s]  No, I was just going like this.
[14484.30s -> 14493.67s]  Oh, fuck.
[14523.27s -> 14524.15s]  You don't have two of those.
[14524.15s -> 14524.95s]  You're not going to do that again.
[14533.42s -> 14534.30s]  Good, good.
[14534.30s -> 14534.86s]  Okay, we're good.
[14535.74s -> 14538.07s]  Deal two damage.
[14538.07s -> 14539.83s]  Add a one, two, uh-huh.
[14545.50s -> 14547.26s]  And you, whenever a friendly minion is healed,
[14547.26s -> 14550.74s]  summon a three, three whelp.
[14550.74s -> 14551.46s]  I don't think so.
[14552.26s -> 14552.66s]  Sorry.
[14557.46s -> 14560.28s]  Did I miss lethal?
[14562.12s -> 14563.00s]  Oh, God damn it.
[14563.00s -> 14565.16s]  He's going to do this fucking four times.
[14575.08s -> 14582.42s]  Remember I was talking about this last night?
[14582.42s -> 14597.22s]  I mean, that's an elemental, but who cares?
[14597.94s -> 14602.47s]  I have to kind of, what do I do?
[14603.19s -> 14606.76s]  I might just go face.
[14606.76s -> 14607.72s]  I kind of have to, right?
[14607.72s -> 14609.24s]  No, but he's going to heal everything.
[14622.81s -> 14623.77s]  Oh, my God.
[14624.81s -> 14657.66s]  I mean, uh, three, eight, seven, six, five, four.
[14657.66s -> 14658.38s]  What do you mean?
[14658.38s -> 14658.94s]  What did I do?
[14661.85s -> 14662.25s]  What was it?
[14662.25s -> 14666.38s]  What was the other one?
[14666.38s -> 14668.38s]  Didn't get shatter?
[14668.38s -> 14669.10s]  Oh, that's right.
[14669.10s -> 14670.38s]  This thing freezes people.
[14670.38s -> 14671.58s]  Oh, fuck.
[14671.58s -> 14672.46s]  I forgot.
[14672.46s -> 14674.86s]  It should be called ice water elemental.
[14674.86s -> 14675.66s]  I forgot.
[14675.66s -> 14677.58s]  I haven't seen this card in four years.
[14678.22s -> 14682.71s]  Aye, I'm going to lose this anyways.
[14690.23s -> 14692.49s]  I think I'm just screwed.
[14692.49s -> 14694.78s]  What am I going to do about this?
[14694.78s -> 14695.18s]  Let's see.
[14697.26s -> 14711.22s]  Oh, my chest.
[14714.10s -> 14721.56s]  Hey, how about this one?
[14722.28s -> 14723.32s]  Oh, whatever.
[14748.44s -> 14792.07s]  Didn't get very far on that one.
[14792.07s -> 14792.79s]  Do arena.
[14793.96s -> 14797.05s]  I don't have any coins for arena.
[14797.05s -> 14799.74s]  I have to buy arena.
[14799.74s -> 14809.61s]  I'm not doing that.
[14809.69s -> 14820.36s]  I got I got you want me to spend $1.99 to go into the arena.
[14820.36s -> 14820.76s]  Do it.
[14821.64s -> 14823.40s]  Don't buy arena.
[14823.40s -> 14825.64s]  You never buy arena.
[14825.64s -> 14829.45s]  You really don't ever purchase arena.
[14829.45s -> 14831.93s]  Purchasing arena is what a grandmother would do.
[14832.57s -> 14836.65s]  Like an addicted grandmother would be buying arena over and over again
[14836.65s -> 14837.93s]  and losing oh and three.
[14837.93s -> 14839.29s]  Oh, that was really fun.
[14839.29s -> 14842.94s]  Now they're going to do that again.
[14842.94s -> 14844.54s]  No, I just have to do some quests.
[14844.54s -> 14847.70s]  Hunter, pirates, and weapons.
[14847.70s -> 14852.06s]  I'm going to play hunter and I'm going to play weapons.
[14852.62s -> 14860.89s]  So play 20 hunter cards and use six weapons.
[14861.45s -> 14867.08s]  Is there such thing as pirate hunter?
[14867.08s -> 14883.26s]  Okay, pirate.
[14886.98s -> 14889.14s]  Draw two card overkill taunt.
[14889.14s -> 14919.42s]  Okay, now we need hunter, just hunter cards.
[14926.89s -> 14953.24s]  Okay, let's do um, I'm sure I didn't rank.
[14954.04s -> 14963.85s]  Rank 25.
[14963.85s -> 14964.33s]  Let's go.
[14964.33s -> 14965.21s]  I'll show you.
[14965.21s -> 14968.65s]  Oh, this person has a cool portrait.
[14968.65s -> 14969.53s]  That means that they're good.
[14970.01s -> 14986.30s]  All right, I need to play pirates and hunter cards and weapons.
[14986.30s -> 15002.14s]  This is only to get to arena so I can embarrass myself again.
[15002.14s -> 15002.62s]  Thank you.
[15003.42s -> 15004.94s]  I can get the pirates out even faster.
[15014.23s -> 15017.66s]  Okay, has Charger and weapon equipped?
[15018.46s -> 15019.98s]  Well, let's just play it smart.
[15019.98s -> 15022.94s]  Let's get the weapon on and then let's put these guys out next turn.
[15023.66s -> 15030.14s]  No, I'm not gonna idiot.
[15036.65s -> 15052.12s]  Okay, I mean like let's go.
[15056.78s -> 15058.14s]  That was wild.
[15058.14s -> 15059.34s]  Get six mana.
[15059.34s -> 15060.86s]  Let's see what you're gonna put down.
[15060.86s -> 15070.31s]  Dead three damage.
[15078.06s -> 15079.50s]  This is you're playing against a baby.
[15079.50s -> 15080.54s]  This is a kid's game.
[15080.54s -> 15081.58s]  No, it's not a kid's game.
[15081.58s -> 15082.62s]  This is a family game.
[15097.69s -> 15098.57s]  Attack with weapon.
[15098.57s -> 15099.45s]  No, not yet.
[15099.45s -> 15102.25s]  No, if you put something down it needs to I need to be able to kill it.
[15103.62s -> 15107.19s]  See that needs to be I need to be able to kill that.
[15112.44s -> 15115.38s]  Oh, look at that.
[15115.38s -> 15116.42s]  No, I don't need to use that.
[15118.98s -> 15119.78s]  Well, maybe I should.
[15144.98s -> 15146.02s]  Why do I keep saying that?
[15152.22s -> 15157.10s]  Three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[15157.10s -> 15170.30s]  Don't get me.
[15180.78s -> 15181.42s]  Come on.
[15181.42s -> 15204.06s]  You want to see what that secret is, don't you?
[15204.06s -> 15206.79s]  Give me I'm gonna do it again.
[15207.99s -> 15209.59s]  I'm gonna freezing trap again.
[15211.22s -> 15213.58s]  Oh, yeah.
[15213.58s -> 15223.59s]  How's that sound?
[15223.59s -> 15224.95s]  Rank 25.
[15227.64s -> 15228.14s]  This.
[15229.32s -> 15230.44s]  God damn it.
[15230.44s -> 15232.84s]  I can't like just get rid of these.
[15239.22s -> 15240.02s]  Somebody came in.
[15242.10s -> 15243.14s]  Somebody just gave me a road.
[15243.70s -> 15245.70s]  Pirate hunter with a question mark.
[15245.70s -> 15246.34s]  It's bucket.
[15246.34s -> 15251.59s]  That's so funny.
[15251.59s -> 15252.79s]  Oh, this is it.
[15255.14s -> 15257.14s]  Five, six, seven, eight.
[15258.46s -> 15259.02s]  This is it.
[15259.82s -> 15268.31s]  I'm gonna win.
[15280.12s -> 15281.08s]  Yeah, I know.
[15281.08s -> 15282.04s]  Don't heal to full health.
[15284.07s -> 15285.67s]  We're gonna be rich.
[15285.67s -> 15287.11s]  No, it's all right.
[15290.95s -> 15291.67s]  Five out of five.
[15291.67s -> 15293.43s]  Oh, you have to restore five health.
[15293.43s -> 15293.83s]  What?
[15293.83s -> 15294.71s]  Oh, fuck.
[15294.71s -> 15295.11s]  It's all right.
[15295.11s -> 15307.90s]  I can get four, five, six, seven, eight.
[15308.54s -> 15310.55s]  Should I release the hounds?
[15311.19s -> 15321.80s]  Okay, come on.
[15322.36s -> 15324.55s]  Discover friendly death rental minion.
[15324.55s -> 15326.31s]  When an enemy attacks your heroes,
[15326.31s -> 15327.75s]  it attacks another random character.
[15327.75s -> 15330.84s]  Just misdirection or explosive trap.
[15330.84s -> 15332.04s]  The explosive trap, I think.
[15336.44s -> 15340.31s]  And then put it on and release the hounds.
[15340.31s -> 15355.05s]  If I release the hounds.
[15358.62s -> 15359.26s]  Oh, shit.
[15359.82s -> 15361.26s]  If I release the hounds, then I can...
[15378.92s -> 15380.04s]  Well, that shouldn't be trade.
[15380.04s -> 15380.68s]  But I need to trade
[15380.68s -> 15382.12s]  because now he doesn't have any minions.
[15385.91s -> 15388.23s]  Why do you have so many of these?
[15389.11s -> 15396.10s]  I swear to God, I've seen this seven times.
[15396.10s -> 15396.90s]  Freezing trap?
[15401.61s -> 15404.09s]  I'm the top Hearthstone streamer on Twitch right now.
[15404.09s -> 15405.69s]  Oh, no, no.
[15420.66s -> 15421.78s]  Three, six, seven.
[15422.42s -> 15422.98s]  It's over.
[15427.02s -> 15429.02s]  This is not a sponsored stream.
[15429.98s -> 15430.78s]  Oh, just...
[15431.50s -> 15446.58s]  This is so embarrassing.
[15453.26s -> 15454.54s]  Wait a minute, did you screw up?
[15456.28s -> 15456.92s]  I just won.
[15458.22s -> 15459.18s]  No, fuck.
[15460.79s -> 15462.39s]  No, stop healing.
[15465.48s -> 15467.16s]  He's gonna get these two again.
[15475.91s -> 15476.55s]  Why?
[15476.55s -> 15478.76s]  Oh, shit.
[15479.80s -> 15482.87s]  What else do I even have in here?
[15498.79s -> 15499.83s]  Now I'm gonna rope him.
[15514.01s -> 15515.37s]  Stuck in chicken league forever.
[15519.85s -> 15520.25s]  All right.
[15520.25s -> 15521.69s]  We just have to do this a couple more times.
[15521.69s -> 15522.09s]  I'm gonna...
[15522.97s -> 15526.22s]  Six pirates to play as...
[15526.22s -> 15527.42s]  We're just doing this to get to arena.
[15542.47s -> 15544.71s]  Unironically stuck at 25.
[15544.71s -> 15545.51s]  Yeah, but we just...
[15546.15s -> 15550.07s]  This deck is awful.
[15550.07s -> 15550.55s]  It's just...
[15550.55s -> 15553.43s]  I just put pirates together just to throw them in here and give...
[15554.23s -> 15555.83s]  Until we get to play arena.
[15555.83s -> 15557.83s]  Pirate hunter.
[15557.83s -> 15558.55s]  You think I'm...
[15561.14s -> 15562.82s]  He's buying more packs.
[15565.40s -> 15566.76s]  Maybe in some other lifetime.
[15580.41s -> 15580.89s]  If I...
[15580.89s -> 15581.37s]  Yeah, I haven't...
[15581.37s -> 15583.37s]  No, I haven't played Cal Drogo yet.
[15583.37s -> 15585.62s]  Let's go.
[15595.51s -> 15597.59s]  Buy packs with your sponsorship money.
[15599.80s -> 15602.04s]  Put the pack opening on your main channel.
[15610.76s -> 15612.28s]  Oh, you got this guy on the ropes.
[15614.26s -> 15615.06s]  Two turkeys.
[15615.06s -> 15616.50s]  Who's gonna make it out on top?
[15617.06s -> 15617.70s]  I wonder.
[15618.34s -> 15624.04s]  Oh, no.
[15624.04s -> 15624.52s]  Don't do that.
[15624.52s -> 15625.16s]  That...
[15625.16s -> 15625.72s]  I could like...
[15626.86s -> 15628.70s]  I was gonna just kill Commandment's face.
[15637.51s -> 15639.27s]  It has ranked 25.
[15641.70s -> 15642.90s]  Hold on, it says...
[15642.90s -> 15646.42s]  It has ranked 25 next to his name on the stream link.
[15647.61s -> 15649.05s]  What do you mean the stream link?
[15654.31s -> 15655.19s]  Wait, what?
[15656.79s -> 15661.77s]  Why does it say that?
[15665.98s -> 15668.39s]  Ranked 35.
[15672.50s -> 15674.02s]  That's fucking ridiculous.
[15676.39s -> 15677.91s]  Why would it say my rank?
[15677.91s -> 15679.75s]  I don't want it to say what rank I am.
[15681.82s -> 15682.62s]  What did he just do?
[15693.72s -> 15696.73s]  Uh, I'm just gonna put on freezing trap.
[15704.22s -> 15705.43s]  This is the...
[15705.43s -> 15708.47s]  Oh, Jesus.
[15719.13s -> 15721.53s]  Everyone on Twitch knows now.
[15721.53s -> 15724.87s]  Yeah, people are gonna scroll by and they're gonna know.
[15725.59s -> 15726.39s]  Everyone knows now.
[15726.39s -> 15727.11s]  I can't hide it.
[15735.29s -> 15738.46s]  I can't get over that in the tags.
[15738.46s -> 15739.02s]  It knows.
[15746.92s -> 15748.52s]  Ranked 25 is the best rank yet.
[15748.52s -> 15751.48s]  Ranked 25 is the highest rank you can be.
[15753.67s -> 15755.59s]  You can't get higher than 25.
[15756.07s -> 15756.87s]  You can go...
[15759.66s -> 15760.30s]  What happened?
[15769.40s -> 15770.36s]  I'm confused.
[15770.36s -> 15770.76s]  Hold on.
[15771.32s -> 15780.89s]  Can I get someone besides spells?
[15784.25s -> 15785.77s]  Yeah, no, you can't be...
[15785.77s -> 15787.21s]  This is the highest rank you can be.
[15788.01s -> 15788.41s]  You can...
[15788.41s -> 15790.34s]  Sure, you can go lower.
[15790.34s -> 15792.98s]  You can drop lower in rank.
[15792.98s -> 15807.16s]  But I'm the highest rank in Hearthstone.
[15807.16s -> 15809.56s]  Why do I have all these fucking spells?
[15816.14s -> 15816.62s]  Just get...
[15816.62s -> 15817.66s]  I don't want them anymore.
[15817.66s -> 15818.30s]  Just get them out.
[15818.94s -> 15828.87s]  Because you auto-completed your deck.
[15829.82s -> 15830.78s]  Oh yeah, I forgot.
[15831.42s -> 15832.78s]  We were just doing this to get to Arena.
[15837.46s -> 15842.09s]  Whenever this minion takes the...
[15842.09s -> 15842.49s]  What is that?
[15844.36s -> 15845.88s]  Summon a 2-3 mech with taunt.
[15845.88s -> 15846.68s]  He's waiting for that one.
[15847.32s -> 15869.91s]  This is the kind of shit you can experience
[15870.47s -> 15873.51s]  on the number one Hearthstone stream on Twitch.
[15874.79s -> 15883.46s]  Number one.
[15883.46s -> 15884.98s]  Ranked 25 plays.
[15885.78s -> 15898.14s]  This guy's pretending to be a noob
[15898.14s -> 15902.06s]  and he's going to pull out an OTK combo?
[15902.06s -> 15904.87s]  Like, dead in one turn?
[15906.97s -> 15908.73s]  I will laugh my fucking ass off
[15908.73s -> 15910.09s]  if I lose in one turn.
[15910.09s -> 15912.25s]  If I get one turn super comboed,
[15912.81s -> 15913.37s]  one turn...
[15914.81s -> 15916.01s]  I will cry laughing.
[15924.54s -> 15926.14s]  No, there's nothing wrong with this.
[15926.14s -> 15927.74s]  You know, the game is free
[15927.74s -> 15929.34s]  and anybody can just get it and play it.
[15929.34s -> 15931.82s]  And you've got to start somewhere.
[15958.22s -> 15959.26s]  Yeah, but you didn't just start.
[15960.30s -> 15961.42s]  Yeah, I have prob...
[15961.42s -> 15962.30s]  I'm not going to lie.
[15962.30s -> 15963.02s]  I'll be honest with you.
[15964.78s -> 15968.06s]  I absolutely have like 400 hours in this game.
[15969.40s -> 15971.08s]  I mean, maybe like 200 hours
[15971.08s -> 15972.36s]  of those are opening packs.
[15973.16s -> 15975.00s]  But this is like back in 2013.
[15977.45s -> 15978.65s]  Oh yeah, what a trade.
[15981.82s -> 15982.32s]  What?
[15991.94s -> 15992.90s]  What's happening?
[15992.90s -> 15993.40s]  Oh, the...
[16003.64s -> 16004.36s]  Get out, leave.
[16004.36s -> 16005.72s]  Don't come to this stream.
[16005.72s -> 16007.40s]  This stream is not one you want to watch.
[16008.33s -> 16010.81s]  The viewers have gone up by like 240.
[16010.81s -> 16013.05s]  You don't want to be here.
[16026.18s -> 16028.42s]  There's a stream like right there
[16028.42s -> 16030.60s]  that you should probably watch instead.
[16030.60s -> 16031.56s]  It's like over there.
[16032.12s -> 16036.42s]  Am I having fun?
[16036.42s -> 16036.92s]  Yeah.
[16040.15s -> 16041.83s]  He just got this game for father's day.
[16041.83s -> 16043.75s]  Yeah, my son told me to try this on.
[16043.75s -> 16045.03s]  It's called Hearthstone.
[16045.59s -> 16050.12s]  What do you got here?
[16050.12s -> 16051.80s]  Shuffle a bomb into your opponent's deck.
[16054.66s -> 16055.78s]  Well, I need a fucking minion.
[16057.70s -> 16069.06s]  Anybody die this turn?
[16069.62s -> 16078.07s]  Can we get a professional hand cam?
[16081.43s -> 16081.93s]  No.
[16086.06s -> 16087.50s]  A fucking hand cam?
[16090.42s -> 16091.14s]  Oh my God.
[16100.79s -> 16103.14s]  We need to see the inputs.
[16107.26s -> 16108.14s]  Oh my God.
[16108.14s -> 16109.98s]  Did I actually just get echoed here?
[16110.78s -> 16112.46s]  Deal three damage, overkill.
[16112.46s -> 16114.06s]  So I'm gonna five-five Devilsaur.
[16114.06s -> 16114.70s]  That's all I need.
[16115.58s -> 16117.78s]  What is this?
[16118.98s -> 16125.45s]  Here comes a bomb.
[16126.17s -> 16132.98s]  Put on a professional foot cam.
[16132.98s -> 16139.42s]  What does that even...
[16139.42s -> 16139.92s]  What?
[16141.21s -> 16142.73s]  I'm not playing like the drums.
[16143.45s -> 16154.01s]  I think it is one.
[16154.98s -> 16155.78s]  No, God damn it.
[16160.01s -> 16160.51s]  Overkill.
[16161.37s -> 16161.87s]  Come on.
[16162.49s -> 16168.04s]  That's not it.
[16168.04s -> 16169.88s]  Three, four, five.
[16170.52s -> 16180.82s]  I need to kill something.
[16184.06s -> 16184.94s]  I didn't lose yet.
[16184.94s -> 16185.44s]  Not yet.
[16192.49s -> 16192.99s]  We lost.
[16192.99s -> 16193.69s]  No, not yet.
[16193.69s -> 16194.19s]  It's not over.
[16201.27s -> 16202.47s]  Oh God, here it comes.
[16208.60s -> 16210.92s]  No, I just need to get a damage card and I can do it.
[16237.34s -> 16245.02s]  I think it's still possible.
[16245.02s -> 16245.52s]  No, it's not.
[16258.30s -> 16258.86s]  Oh, oops.
[16258.86s -> 16260.30s]  I didn't mean to do that.
[16260.30s -> 16262.90s]  There's a couple of chicken league plays.
[16262.90s -> 16276.28s]  Not a big deal.
[16276.28s -> 16276.68s]  I'm dead.
[16276.68s -> 16277.72s]  He just has to click on me.
[16288.97s -> 16290.41s]  I'm getting BM'd, aren't I?
[16303.96s -> 16305.59s]  This is great.
[16305.59s -> 16307.27s]  Concede before he kills you.
[16307.27s -> 16307.77s]  No.
[16308.33s -> 16310.57s]  I'm gonna concede right when he's about to hit me.
[16311.13s -> 16331.40s]  50 gold, 50 gold, 50 gold.
[16331.40s -> 16333.40s]  Let's go to arena, boys and girls.
[16333.40s -> 16348.54s]  Where we going?
[16348.54s -> 16348.94s]  Who?
[16348.94s -> 16356.80s]  You want me to be Uther the Lightbringer?
[16356.80s -> 16370.41s]  Uther it is?
[16370.41s -> 16372.97s]  All right, we got the last arena deck.
[16372.97s -> 16374.73s]  You can call me terrible all you want, right?
[16374.73s -> 16377.29s]  Like obviously I was playing pirate fucking hunter,
[16377.29s -> 16378.09s]  but this is important.
[16378.83s -> 16382.11s]  The last arena deck was not very good.
[16382.11s -> 16382.99s]  It was very bad.
[16385.39s -> 16387.71s]  It was maybe like a one and a half out of 10.
[16388.36s -> 16393.61s]  So, I mean, you've seen me play heroic single player.
[16393.61s -> 16395.07s]  I was, I did all right.
[16395.07s -> 16397.07s]  I went through a couple runs of the normal one.
[16397.63s -> 16402.27s]  You've seen me play with the right cards.
[16402.27s -> 16403.79s]  I think we can accomplish something here.
[16403.79s -> 16404.59s]  Come on.
[16404.59s -> 16405.39s]  Give me some good ones.
[16405.95s -> 16419.04s]  Flame Juggler, you died on heroic.
[16419.04s -> 16422.08s]  Yeah, but I got to like the eighth boss or seventh boss.
[16423.04s -> 16425.20s]  Splog just gave five community subs.
[16425.20s -> 16433.77s]  Thank you, Splog.
[16433.77s -> 16434.27s]  All right.
[16435.32s -> 16437.48s]  Can I get banned for people playing on,
[16438.12s -> 16440.36s]  well, picking cards is I don't think is,
[16441.08s -> 16442.76s]  it's not like people have control of the game.
[16443.40s -> 16455.42s]  What are you doing?
[16455.42s -> 16457.18s]  Why are so many people clicking on this?
[16466.00s -> 16466.56s]  62%?
[16467.52s -> 16475.68s]  That's such a monster amount of people.
[16475.68s -> 16477.12s]  That what's wrong?
[16477.12s -> 16484.64s]  What is wrong?
[16487.71s -> 16489.79s]  70% of every person just clicked.
[16489.79s -> 16491.39s]  There has to be something going on.
[16491.39s -> 16496.36s]  What is it?
[16496.36s -> 16506.28s]  I'm not buying cards.
[16511.45s -> 16514.97s]  When two thirds of every person clicks on back,
[16514.97s -> 16516.57s]  I think that there's something wrong.
[16516.57s -> 16521.60s]  I'm not buying card packs.
[16521.60s -> 16530.76s]  Choose one of these.
[16531.80s -> 16533.56s]  I'm already opening card packs.
[16533.56s -> 16537.79s]  Every time you click on one of these,
[16537.79s -> 16540.67s]  you get to see another pack of three and you pick one.
[16540.67s -> 16548.22s]  All right.
[16548.22s -> 16551.42s]  So the only card you want me to pick is this one.
[16551.42s -> 16553.58s]  It sounds like a fucking plan, guys.
[16558.30s -> 16559.42s]  What are you doing?
[16561.93s -> 16566.40s]  I'm not actually going to click on lowly squire.
[16566.40s -> 16573.53s]  I'm not actually clicking on this.
[16573.53s -> 16574.25s]  Really?
[16574.25s -> 16584.00s]  This deck already has got trouble written all over it.
[16584.00s -> 16596.35s]  Hold on.
[16596.35s -> 16596.75s]  Hold on.
[16596.75s -> 16597.15s]  Hold on.
[16597.15s -> 16598.43s]  This can be influenced here.
[16598.43s -> 16599.23s]  Hold on.
[16599.23s -> 16600.67s]  Try it again.
[16600.67s -> 16607.23s]  That's better.
[16607.23s -> 16611.24s]  He's being disobedient.
[16613.61s -> 16623.18s]  I'm not clicking on the shop.
[16623.18s -> 16624.22s]  Scribe is the best one.
[16624.22s -> 16625.34s]  It's not even close.
[16625.34s -> 16628.16s]  You know, I wish I could click on it,
[16628.16s -> 16633.15s]  but I have to work with what I'm given.
[16648.19s -> 16651.13s]  Just for anyone that's curious,
[16651.13s -> 16655.63s]  this is the worst card in Hearthstone.
[16655.63s -> 16659.66s]  So I would veto if you even picked this.
[16666.46s -> 16668.06s]  Just pretend this one's not here.
[16668.06s -> 16672.06s]  People are voting for manor rate.
[16672.62s -> 16680.08s]  I feel like the people that are clicking on manor rate
[16680.89s -> 16682.89s]  and the people that are clicking on manor rate,
[16682.89s -> 16684.33s]  especially not manor rate,
[16684.33s -> 16687.45s]  especially the one in the middle there,
[16687.45s -> 16691.32s]  I think they were just doing it to make like a laugh.
[16691.32s -> 16691.88s]  You know what I mean?
[16695.69s -> 16696.97s]  You can't believe I paid for arena.
[16696.97s -> 16699.37s]  How much am I going to get there?
[16700.01s -> 16704.80s]  All right, this amoeba is starting to get together.
[16704.80s -> 16706.72s]  All right, so little exorcist, taunt, battle cry.
[16706.72s -> 16707.36s]  That's pretty good.
[16716.19s -> 16717.31s]  We have too many of these.
[16721.44s -> 16722.72s]  This is the best card in arena.
[16728.06s -> 16729.42s]  I know everyone's clicking on this.
[16730.62s -> 16731.26s]  Hey, what?
[16731.26s -> 16731.90s]  Oops.
[16731.90s -> 16734.49s]  Everyone was clicking on it.
[16734.49s -> 16735.05s]  I know you were.
[16735.61s -> 16736.73s]  Everybody clicked it.
[16738.40s -> 16740.00s]  By the way, guys, can we get a...
[16740.00s -> 16740.56s]  Excuse me.
[16741.20s -> 16742.40s]  If you're going to click,
[16742.40s -> 16745.04s]  please click like in the middle of the cards,
[16745.04s -> 16746.48s]  not like here or here.
[16747.12s -> 16747.92s]  You're making it...
[16747.92s -> 16749.20s]  You're making a big balloon.
[16749.92s -> 16752.41s]  Okay, now that we've had the discussion, go for it.
[16770.19s -> 16771.07s]  93...
[16771.71s -> 16774.70s]  What?
[16781.45s -> 16782.41s]  Oh, I guess I'm...
[16786.00s -> 16790.01s]  Okay, that was a...
[16790.57s -> 16795.95s]  All right, go for it.
[16795.95s -> 16810.89s]  I guess I'm just going to pick this one.
[16813.07s -> 16814.59s]  I'm going to say it's going to be...
[16817.40s -> 16818.44s]  How about...
[16818.44s -> 16821.53s]  I think it's going to be...
[16821.53s -> 16832.01s]  I need some one drops and it's going to be Glowtron.
[16832.01s -> 16834.86s]  Wrong choice.
[16834.86s -> 16847.04s]  I'm sorry, but I'm going by what I see on the screen.
[16847.04s -> 16852.56s]  Always Yeti.
[16852.56s -> 16853.92s]  Oh my fucking God.
[16853.92s -> 16855.04s]  I'm just going to pick the cards.
[16855.60s -> 16857.36s]  I'm just going to fucking pick them.
[16857.36s -> 16858.32s]  I'm just going to pick them.
[16866.49s -> 16869.32s]  He's literally crying.
[16869.32s -> 16871.96s]  You're doing this because you want me to open packs.
[16871.96s -> 16883.45s]  Is that what you really are saying right now?
[16883.45s -> 16893.26s]  Try it again.
[16893.26s -> 16894.70s]  Oh, fucking God damn it.
[16895.26s -> 16896.22s]  It doesn't matter.
[16896.22s -> 16897.42s]  I see you.
[16897.42s -> 16898.62s]  I see you guys right here.
[16899.18s -> 16902.72s]  I was going to pick the Yeti anyways.
[16902.72s -> 16906.36s]  Yeah, I got you.
[16906.36s -> 16910.52s]  You want Spellbreaker?
[16914.43s -> 16916.99s]  It's splitting up a little bit here.
[16916.99s -> 16931.50s]  Spellbreaker it is.
[16931.50s -> 16933.02s]  Always Antique Healbot.
[16933.02s -> 16965.80s]  You have to zoom in more.
[16965.80s -> 16967.08s]  Why are you clicking up here?
[16967.08s -> 16968.12s]  What are you guys doing?
[16969.08s -> 16972.28s]  Have I lost all faith in this right now?
[16995.95s -> 17000.83s]  Webinize Pinata.
[17000.83s -> 17004.43s]  I'm going to go 0-3 again because of this.
[17004.43s -> 17014.52s]  I'm about to step in here.
[17014.52s -> 17016.92s]  Choose a card equals Jerma's Choice.
[17016.92s -> 17017.48s]  Oh, nice.
[17017.48s -> 17018.44s]  That's a good idea.
[17018.44s -> 17019.74s]  Not like it matters.
[17020.30s -> 17022.06s]  12 of these cards have been awful.
[17022.06s -> 17024.83s]  You're going to go 0-3 because you're bad.
[17024.83s -> 17042.80s]  Now I'm going to go 0-3 because I just picked Weaponized Pinata.
[17042.80s -> 17049.53s]  Light's Justice.
[17049.53s -> 17066.11s]  Now I know you guys are just fucking with me.
[17066.11s -> 17066.75s]  What a joke.
[17066.75s -> 17069.24s]  This is worse than the last one.
[17069.24s -> 17082.86s]  This deck actually might be worse than the first one.
[17082.86s -> 17084.38s]  All right, we don't have very much.
[17084.38s -> 17086.54s]  We got like 13 more to do.
[17086.54s -> 17093.28s]  This is a tough one.
[17093.28s -> 17094.40s]  Actually, all these are good.
[17094.40s -> 17101.04s]  People are just clicking the golden card.
[17109.90s -> 17112.38s]  Three, two, one.
[17112.38s -> 17115.42s]  You gave us this power?
[17115.42s -> 17117.66s]  Yeah, and I'm going to try to at least win one game.
[17117.66s -> 17123.66s]  If I can go like two and two or two and three, I'll be happy.
[17123.66s -> 17129.96s]  Do three damage to all minions.
[17129.96s -> 17141.20s]  Jesus, this is close.
[17141.20s -> 17144.64s]  Say the name out loud of whichever card you want them to click.
[17144.64s -> 17145.52s]  It's not that hard.
[17148.92s -> 17156.20s]  I think you underestimate this community, okay?
[17156.20s -> 17156.76s]  I'll show you.
[17161.66s -> 17170.12s]  Please everybody click on Muster for Battle.
[17170.12s -> 17170.92s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[17170.92s -> 17172.76s]  Click on any other card.
[17172.76s -> 17173.32s]  Any other card.
[17173.32s -> 17174.20s]  I don't want that.
[17174.20s -> 17184.67s]  I want Minibot or...
[17184.67s -> 17196.57s]  Hey, please click on Shielded Minibot.
[17196.57s -> 17197.21s]  See?
[17197.21s -> 17198.25s]  Only 9%.
[17198.25s -> 17198.81s]  Hold on.
[17198.81s -> 17200.88s]  We're doing this again.
[17200.88s -> 17204.86s]  Everyone click on True Silver Champion.
[17204.86s -> 17210.19s]  If True Silver Champion does not have at least 40% of the vote,
[17210.19s -> 17211.31s]  the stream is turning off.
[17229.39s -> 17229.95s]  See, look at this.
[17232.72s -> 17236.75s]  Look at these anarchists over here.
[17236.75s -> 17238.91s]  15% just want this to turn off.
[17239.55s -> 17241.63s]  38% are just like, is he bluffing?
[17241.63s -> 17263.23s]  We got 47% good boys and good girls.
[17263.23s -> 17264.11s]  Hurry up.
[17264.11s -> 17272.24s]  This is part of the experience.
[17272.24s -> 17275.63s]  Bomblobber or Argent Protector?
[17278.25s -> 17282.30s]  This is very mid-heavy.
[17282.30s -> 17283.74s]  This experience is boring.
[17283.74s -> 17286.65s]  Hey, what?
[17292.25s -> 17292.89s]  It's boring.
[17292.89s -> 17298.86s]  It is.
[17298.86s -> 17303.02s]  Well, it won't be long now until it's over.
[17303.02s -> 17303.66s]  Which one was it?
[17303.66s -> 17313.53s]  Argent Protector, right?
[17313.53s -> 17314.65s]  We can't see the deck.
[17317.07s -> 17320.35s]  Well, if you had not been goofing around so much,
[17320.35s -> 17322.11s]  we wouldn't be so zoomed in.
[17322.11s -> 17332.96s]  You guys were goofing around.
[17332.96s -> 17336.32s]  All right, only like seven more cards to pick up.
[17336.32s -> 17345.52s]  You're the kind of person that punishes one person,
[17345.52s -> 17347.36s]  the whole class for one person's mistake.
[17349.85s -> 17352.16s]  I'm fairly certain it would be...
[17352.16s -> 17352.80s]  Okay, hold on.
[17352.80s -> 17355.39s]  I don't know if I don't agree with that.
[17355.39s -> 17358.27s]  It was like 38% of people in the classroom
[17358.27s -> 17360.19s]  were all throwing coins at me.
[17364.67s -> 17365.55s]  I'm going to keep everybody
[17365.55s -> 17367.07s]  and we're going to have a long discussion about it.
[17370.24s -> 17371.76s]  It was like more than 40%.
[17378.51s -> 17379.47s]  Sun River Spy.
[17380.03s -> 17383.12s]  Do we even have a secret?
[17383.12s -> 17385.07s]  I'm just being sabotaged.
[17397.39s -> 17398.75s]  We can't see the deck.
[17400.30s -> 17402.06s]  Okay, hold on.
[17402.06s -> 17407.88s]  You guys have learned your lesson.
[17407.88s -> 17408.36s]  Secrets.
[17409.00s -> 17409.64s]  Sacrifice.
[17410.28s -> 17411.84s]  All right, let me pull...
[17411.84s -> 17414.03s]  Hold on, let me pull this back.
[17414.03s -> 17414.51s]  There you go.
[17414.51s -> 17416.68s]  Now you can see the deck.
[17416.68s -> 17418.22s]  So, see?
[17418.22s -> 17419.34s]  This is what we got to work with.
[17419.34s -> 17420.70s]  Pretty balanced so far.
[17420.70s -> 17422.64s]  I almost just instantly clicked the zoom up.
[17433.10s -> 17435.26s]  I mean, why are you punishing all of us
[17435.26s -> 17436.94s]  for the mistake of one person?
[17437.50s -> 17442.41s]  Oh, but yeah, I threw a rock into the blackboard.
[17442.41s -> 17444.33s]  And so did the person next to me,
[17444.33s -> 17446.01s]  to the right and next to me to the left.
[17446.01s -> 17447.21s]  And two people behind me.
[17447.21s -> 17448.73s]  And three people in the front.
[17448.73s -> 17451.00s]  How many people are in the classroom?
[17452.11s -> 17453.95s]  There's like 26 people in the classroom.
[17454.67s -> 17457.71s]  Like 13 or 14 of us threw rocks.
[17457.71s -> 17458.75s]  Why are you punishing me?
[17459.39s -> 17460.11s]  One person.
[17460.67s -> 17472.67s]  These last ones got a count.
[17476.92s -> 17477.56s]  Kick out...
[17477.56s -> 17478.68s]  Yeah, half you guys are getting
[17478.68s -> 17480.52s]  going to the principal's office.
[17480.52s -> 17489.02s]  Jeremy, we all hate you.
[17489.02s -> 17491.66s]  This deck is fucking terrible.
[17495.58s -> 17497.58s]  This is randomized cards.
[17498.54s -> 17499.82s]  I'm taking the crocodile.
[17500.78s -> 17501.90s]  I'm picking the next ones.
[17501.90s -> 17503.26s]  I'm going to try to salvage this.
[17503.26s -> 17503.98s]  It's over.
[17503.98s -> 17514.40s]  All right, you can pick this a lot.
[17514.40s -> 17514.88s]  I don't know.
[17514.88s -> 17515.44s]  I have no idea.
[17515.44s -> 17516.24s]  I don't know half these do.
[17520.57s -> 17521.45s]  This one's...
[17521.45s -> 17525.84s]  Murloc Knight is like really, really good.
[17525.84s -> 17527.36s]  50-50 split.
[17527.36s -> 17530.12s]  True Silver Champ.
[17530.12s -> 17531.00s]  Consecration.
[17531.00s -> 17532.94s]  All right, we're good.
[17532.94s -> 17534.70s]  Boys and girls, it's time.
[17535.34s -> 17538.75s]  Check hero portrait.
[17538.75s -> 17539.68s]  What about it?
[17545.32s -> 17547.40s]  You took the last three expansions
[17547.40s -> 17548.36s]  through dice in the air.
[17548.36s -> 17550.68s]  Like 200 dice and just gave random cards.
[17550.68s -> 17551.56s]  None of these work together.
[17554.89s -> 17556.17s]  I'm going to go 0 and 3 again
[17556.17s -> 17557.69s]  or like 1 and 3.
[17557.69s -> 17559.29s]  And everyone's going to make fun of me.
[17559.29s -> 17561.36s]  This is what I...
[17561.36s -> 17562.16s]  We're going to have to work with.
[17562.16s -> 17563.68s]  I have to bake a cake with cement
[17564.49s -> 17565.69s]  and feed it to people.
[17565.69s -> 17571.76s]  Let's go.
[17571.76s -> 17582.54s]  Quick retire to redo the deck.
[17582.54s -> 17582.94s]  I'm not.
[17583.90s -> 17584.94s]  You're not going to get me with that one.
[17595.50s -> 17596.14s]  I'm not going to sit here
[17596.14s -> 17597.34s]  and get berated by a teacher
[17597.34s -> 17600.14s]  who picked Steel Ranger.
[17602.86s -> 17603.74s]  We'll be alone.
[17604.78s -> 17608.01s]  I'm going for it.
[17608.01s -> 17608.89s]  And you know what?
[17608.89s -> 17610.25s]  Even if I make bogus plays,
[17610.25s -> 17611.69s]  I'm going to trust myself
[17611.69s -> 17612.49s]  and I'm going to play.
[17613.29s -> 17614.73s]  This deck is so bad.
[17615.45s -> 17616.17s]  So bad.
[17616.81s -> 17617.77s]  It is the worst deck
[17617.77s -> 17619.45s]  I think I've ever seen in the game.
[17619.45s -> 17622.51s]  I mean, you guys have truly outdone yourselves.
[17626.56s -> 17629.24s]  I picked this one.
[17629.24s -> 17629.96s]  But I'm, you know,
[17629.96s -> 17631.96s]  I'm going to block out all the negative energy.
[17631.96s -> 17633.48s]  I'm going to just play
[17633.48s -> 17635.00s]  even if I make mistakes.
[17635.00s -> 17636.28s]  You guys aren't even here with me.
[17636.28s -> 17636.76s]  I'm here.
[17636.76s -> 17638.44s]  I'm just looking at the screen by myself.
[17638.44s -> 17640.44s]  It's just me and this guy in a room together
[17640.44s -> 17641.64s]  with a chess board in front of us.
[17642.36s -> 17643.80s]  So with that being said,
[17651.92s -> 17653.76s]  I'm just, it's just me in the game.
[17653.76s -> 17654.48s]  Me in the cards.
[17655.12s -> 17657.39s]  I got the sunglasses on.
[17659.72s -> 17663.21s]  All right, that's fine.
[17663.77s -> 17666.00s]  Let me take a look here.
[17666.00s -> 17666.96s]  Okay, bingo.
[17671.32s -> 17672.36s]  Don't silence that.
[17685.72s -> 17686.36s]  Don't listen to that.
[17686.36s -> 17686.92s]  I can hear them,
[17686.92s -> 17690.12s]  but I can't, I can see their mouths moving,
[17690.12s -> 17690.84s]  but I can't hear them.
[17693.64s -> 17694.44s]  Wrong, wrong.
[17695.00s -> 17695.64s]  Not going to get it.
[17697.44s -> 17699.76s]  Absolutely fucking fantastic.
[17699.76s -> 17700.24s]  Keep it up.
[17710.52s -> 17711.96s]  I'm not in reading chat.
[17711.96s -> 17714.40s]  I'm playing this as if it was me in the bed.
[17715.12s -> 17723.15s]  Let me see what you guys say.
[17732.72s -> 17734.08s]  Let's all leave.
[17734.08s -> 17736.88s]  Oh, no, I'm not supposed to be looking at you.
[17737.60s -> 17741.82s]  I'm going to silence that.
[17743.58s -> 17745.50s]  No, give each player a spare part.
[17745.50s -> 17746.06s]  I want one.
[17753.00s -> 17754.28s]  I don't think there are any secrets
[17754.28s -> 17754.84s]  in the whole deck.
[17769.47s -> 17770.43s]  Miss, hit the 1-1.
[17771.07s -> 17771.85s]  Do it again.
[17773.05s -> 17773.77s]  That's perfect.
[17773.77s -> 17774.65s]  I'm fine with that.
[17774.65s -> 17776.25s]  I got avenging wrath coming up here.
[17782.43s -> 17784.91s]  This is a, like when you take a picture
[17785.47s -> 17786.99s]  of an avenging wrath turn,
[17787.47s -> 17788.19s]  it's this one.
[17788.99s -> 17813.37s]  I'm not looking.
[17813.37s -> 17814.25s]  I'm not looking over there.
[17839.07s -> 17843.04s]  Okay, now I think I'm going to taunt up this.
[17843.84s -> 17846.73s]  Or no.
[17846.73s -> 17848.41s]  Um, no, get it up.
[17848.41s -> 17848.81s]  Get more.
[17851.61s -> 17859.63s]  I'm going to fucking 100 all.
[17859.63s -> 17860.51s]  I'm busy.
[17860.51s -> 17861.23s]  I'm busy.
[17862.35s -> 17862.91s]  I can't.
[17864.52s -> 17865.40s]  I'm busy.
[17870.70s -> 17872.46s]  Mom, mom, I'm in the bathroom.
[17874.91s -> 17875.87s]  Mom just comes over
[17875.87s -> 17878.35s]  and slides a hundred dollar bill under the bathroom.
[17878.35s -> 17880.99s]  I've been in the toilet for like fucking 45 minutes
[17880.99s -> 17883.23s]  and mom slides a hundred under the bathroom door.
[17884.03s -> 17884.83s]  Mom, stop it.
[17884.83s -> 17885.55s]  Get out of here.
[17890.19s -> 17891.87s]  Uh, no, that was flutters.
[17891.87s -> 17894.75s]  Thank you so much for the fucking hundred dollars flutters.
[17895.31s -> 17898.08s]  Been a fan of you and stir
[17898.08s -> 17899.60s]  for the better part of six years.
[17899.60s -> 17900.80s]  I love your content and keep it up.
[17900.80s -> 17901.92s]  Thank you so much.
[17901.92s -> 17902.96s]  Glad to have you.
[17902.96s -> 17904.48s]  You've been around for a long time.
[17904.48s -> 17905.85s]  What do I do?
[17905.85s -> 17914.40s]  And then I'm going to taunt.
[17914.96s -> 17916.08s]  Which one do I taunt though?
[17917.15s -> 17918.11s]  I'm itching my head.
[17918.11s -> 17919.31s]  I'm turning fucking crazy.
[17919.87s -> 17922.75s]  Taunt the storm and I think that's what I would do.
[17927.80s -> 17928.20s]  I win.
[17929.36s -> 17930.32s]  You said it couldn't be done.
[17931.04s -> 17932.84s]  It's one game.
[17932.84s -> 17933.32s]  Relax.
[17933.96s -> 17958.27s]  Melanie is okay.
[17959.07s -> 17960.80s]  He's getting a little desperate.
[17963.63s -> 17963.95s]  Okay.
[17964.75s -> 17965.47s]  We're so close.
[17965.47s -> 17966.35s]  Here comes the murloc.
[17967.79s -> 17980.48s]  I ran him a legendary minion to your hand.
[17980.48s -> 17981.12s]  I can do them both.
[17995.26s -> 17995.82s]  Job done.
[18010.43s -> 18011.23s]  Greed is good.
[18011.23s -> 18012.11s]  Greed is good.
[18012.11s -> 18012.83s]  Greed is good.
[18013.87s -> 18023.63s]  1 and 0.
[18023.63s -> 18024.11s]  Oh fuck!
[18024.11s -> 18025.23s]  That did 25 damage!
[18033.60s -> 18034.40s]  Not 0 and 3.
[18037.64s -> 18038.68s]  1 and 0 actually.
[18043.29s -> 18044.89s]  This deck is giving me the middle finger.
[18045.92s -> 18047.20s]  You guys didn't even try to do that
[18047.20s -> 18048.40s]  and that's what you've done.
[18048.40s -> 18064.11s]  It's going to be 1 and 3.
[18066.52s -> 18067.48s]  Not yet.
[18067.48s -> 18067.96s]  1 and 0.
[18070.12s -> 18072.04s]  Let the hunt begin.
[18072.04s -> 18074.41s]  Night with honor.
[18074.41s -> 18076.12s]  See this is to trust myself.
[18076.12s -> 18077.96s]  Even if the plays are not perfect.
[18078.94s -> 18080.54s]  This is 2, 3, 4, 5.
[18081.50s -> 18082.54s]  I shouldn't do anything.
[18083.10s -> 18087.23s]  I get a perfect mana curve every turn.
[18087.23s -> 18106.91s]  I was gonna say if that was a 1.
[18107.71s -> 18114.41s]  All right.
[18114.41s -> 18114.97s]  Again.
[18114.97s -> 18115.37s]  Focus.
[18116.25s -> 18123.04s]  Coin out the exorcist.
[18124.16s -> 18124.40s]  No.
[18133.88s -> 18134.60s]  Good.
[18134.60s -> 18136.83s]  Play the curve.
[18136.83s -> 18138.51s]  I'm not looking at you guys.
[18138.51s -> 18138.91s]  Hold on.
[18139.47s -> 18144.68s]  I'm just gonna play the curve.
[18144.68s -> 18153.87s]  That's okay.
[18154.59s -> 18160.76s]  Although I could true silver this.
[18166.94s -> 18174.51s]  I got my steel rager.
[18174.51s -> 18176.35s]  The thing that everyone was laughing at me for.
[18177.07s -> 18178.35s]  We'll see if they're laughing now
[18178.35s -> 18181.23s]  when he drops a fucking thick 2, 5 right now.
[18186.11s -> 18186.83s]  They're not laughing.
[18188.51s -> 18197.36s]  Let's see.
[18200.70s -> 18208.25s]  I'm just gonna taunt.
[18210.41s -> 18212.17s]  Let me taunt and kill this.
[18226.38s -> 18227.58s]  I don't want him to have any minions.
[18227.58s -> 18228.86s]  I don't care if he kills this.
[18228.86s -> 18229.90s]  He's a hunter.
[18230.46s -> 18238.91s]  I got boulder frisk coming up here
[18238.91s -> 18240.99s]  and I've got jouster.
[18240.99s -> 18242.11s]  I got jouster right now.
[18242.75s -> 18243.71s]  Oh, that's not good.
[18256.41s -> 18258.01s]  I mean if it is snipe then
[18259.85s -> 18267.80s]  will this trigger it?
[18268.75s -> 18269.39s]  If it is snipe.
[18276.75s -> 18277.07s]  Come on.
[18277.07s -> 18277.95s]  Give me that health.
[18277.95s -> 18278.27s]  Yes.
[18284.60s -> 18285.00s]  Wait.
[18285.00s -> 18287.00s]  Somebody say snipe is not in arena.
[18289.92s -> 18293.96s]  I'm gonna go with this.
[18300.27s -> 18302.99s]  It's not.
[18305.15s -> 18307.24s]  What's going on?
[18307.24s -> 18307.48s]  All right.
[18307.48s -> 18307.88s]  Here we go.
[18307.88s -> 18325.79s]  Okay.
[18325.79s -> 18326.43s]  We're good.
[18326.43s -> 18326.83s]  We're good.
[18347.82s -> 18348.62s]  Was he being mean?
[18348.62s -> 18349.50s]  Was that mean?
[18349.50s -> 18350.73s]  No.
[18350.73s -> 18352.01s]  I get the minions out of here.
[18352.01s -> 18353.13s]  I gotta get rid of those minions.
[18363.61s -> 18364.41s]  Oh never mind.
[18364.41s -> 18365.77s]  We gave it rush.
[18365.77s -> 18371.48s]  I was gonna say the steel erasure
[18371.48s -> 18373.24s]  seems pretty good right now doesn't it?
[18373.24s -> 18377.76s]  I'm gonna do bear into silver moon portal.
[18386.56s -> 18387.36s]  Excellent.
[18387.36s -> 18404.12s]  So what is this secret then?
[18404.12s -> 18405.64s]  I'm not familiar with some of the newer secrets.
[18416.12s -> 18417.56s]  Is rat trap the one where if you play
[18417.56s -> 18421.76s]  too many cards in a hand return
[18421.76s -> 18425.12s]  it'll summon like a big rat.
[18425.12s -> 18425.76s]  Three cards.
[18425.76s -> 18426.00s]  Okay.
[18430.27s -> 18431.31s]  He's thinking.
[18431.31s -> 18436.24s]  There's another one.
[18445.71s -> 18445.87s]  All right.
[18445.87s -> 18446.91s]  So we're gonna test.
[18446.91s -> 18448.19s]  I'm gonna send him straight in.
[18448.91s -> 18451.02s]  All right.
[18451.02s -> 18452.70s]  And it is explosive.
[18453.34s -> 18455.29s]  Bring out the rager.
[18457.45s -> 18458.57s]  Rager gets rid of this guy.
[18465.77s -> 18466.17s]  Uh oh.
[18466.81s -> 18467.85s]  It's snake trap.
[18468.41s -> 18469.96s]  Interesting.
[18470.52s -> 18476.68s]  I thought it was rat trap.
[18488.38s -> 18494.97s]  Why did it have to be snakes?
[18495.61s -> 18510.64s]  You don't get to do that twice do you?
[18514.33s -> 18517.32s]  All right.
[18517.32s -> 18519.48s]  I got I still have some pretty great minions here.
[18519.48s -> 18521.96s]  I got ogre and uh and stalker coming up next.
[18535.87s -> 18536.83s]  Silence the snake.
[18537.47s -> 18538.99s]  Why I'm not gonna do that.
[18538.99s -> 18547.36s]  A lot of rush.
[18552.65s -> 18553.21s]  Well all right.
[18553.21s -> 18553.77s]  Let's see here.
[18555.08s -> 18557.80s]  I could just flood the board and just go face and win.
[18567.90s -> 18574.54s]  That makes more sense.
[18576.46s -> 18584.30s]  Let's see.
[18584.30s -> 18585.02s]  Got anything else?
[18593.04s -> 18594.32s]  Or did I did I win?
[18594.32s -> 18594.96s]  You got a taunt?
[18594.96s -> 18595.76s]  You got a spell?
[18596.40s -> 18597.68s]  Are we two and oh?
[18601.23s -> 18601.63s]  All right.
[18602.67s -> 18603.15s]  All right.
[18603.15s -> 18603.47s]  Okay.
[18604.03s -> 18605.47s]  Um game over.
[18605.47s -> 18618.99s]  Let's well play.
[18618.99s -> 18624.49s]  Two and oh.
[18624.49s -> 18627.45s]  Now he's gonna go two and three right?
[18627.45s -> 18628.65s]  That's what you're gonna say.
[18628.65s -> 18629.37s]  Yeah there it is.
[18634.92s -> 18636.76s]  Even if I get to like 11 and oh.
[18637.40s -> 18638.70s]  It's not gonna happen.
[18647.88s -> 18656.94s]  Well there's the squire.
[18657.50s -> 18663.02s]  Here comes a mirror match.
[18663.74s -> 18664.96s]  That's not good.
[18665.52s -> 18670.73s]  Oh that was a juicy one.
[18670.73s -> 18689.02s]  Juicy one buddy.
[18689.02s -> 18691.45s]  Coin taunt.
[18691.45s -> 18696.70s]  That's oh there's only it's supposed to one attack.
[18696.70s -> 18713.64s]  Okay I'm not paying attention.
[18713.64s -> 18715.00s]  I know they're probably making fun of you right now.
[18715.00s -> 18715.96s]  But don't let them make fun of you.
[18716.84s -> 18718.76s]  It was the right call.
[18738.32s -> 18739.48s]  It's okay.
[18741.76s -> 18742.56s]  Gotta get in there.
[18743.60s -> 18744.48s]  All right hold on.
[18745.04s -> 18746.00s]  Hold on just a second.
[18746.56s -> 18750.43s]  I mean let's not be hasty here.
[18755.23s -> 18756.35s]  Not the time for equality.
[18759.71s -> 18761.71s]  Why is this so much mana?
[18761.71s -> 18762.91s]  Did it just be two mana?
[18783.98s -> 18785.02s]  Uh do I hit?
[18785.02s -> 18785.50s]  I don't.
[18786.30s -> 18787.58s]  No don't do anything.
[18788.14s -> 18792.36s]  He's gonna get greedy.
[18792.36s -> 18793.16s]  He's gonna hit me in the face.
[18801.93s -> 18804.40s]  Okay not greedy.
[18805.12s -> 18806.32s]  I have a consecration in here.
[18807.04s -> 18807.60s]  Where is it?
[18812.91s -> 18814.43s]  Oh fuck I forgot what that thing did.
[18825.29s -> 18830.52s]  Um do I kill this or do I let him kill it?
[18830.52s -> 18830.84s]  Maybe.
[18833.50s -> 18840.17s]  All right now just attack me in the face with that 5-1.
[18845.55s -> 18848.43s]  I'm in a good spot but it's not a terrible spot.
[18849.23s -> 18850.04s]  Could be worse.
[18857.44s -> 18859.20s]  Why is everyone doing the flat liner?
[18861.56s -> 18863.72s]  Oh you're saying here the flat liners.
[18875.42s -> 18877.42s]  If I get a consecration right here this is...
[18878.46s -> 18881.04s]  I remember you could do the quality consecrate.
[18882.32s -> 18883.04s]  That's not good.
[18887.37s -> 18889.13s]  I mean this is the only play is this.
[18889.93s -> 18902.38s]  2-1.
[18903.96s -> 18905.64s]  You guys aren't very supportive are you?
[18908.30s -> 18908.80s]  Shit.
[18911.79s -> 18913.15s]  I need consecration.
[18913.15s -> 18913.79s]  It's in here.
[18925.44s -> 18932.16s]  That's not consecration but it can at least take out the mechanical yeti.
[18946.68s -> 18947.80s]  How did this happen?
[18951.47s -> 18953.47s]  I started out with bad plays.
[18954.11s -> 18955.31s]  I started out with bad cards.
[18956.52s -> 18958.52s]  This is not over yet.
[18958.52s -> 18960.28s]  I just have to draw a consecration.
[18960.92s -> 18962.20s]  We're back to square one.
[18968.27s -> 18971.31s]  If I draw a consecration right now the board is empty.
[18976.16s -> 18978.68s]  That's not consecration.
[18978.68s -> 18979.16s]  That's it.
[18996.56s -> 19001.92s]  2-1.
[19001.92s -> 19003.12s]  Sometimes you lose them.
[19003.12s -> 19003.68s]  It's all right.
[19003.68s -> 19004.24s]  We'll get it back.
[19010.46s -> 19011.42s]  We'll get them next time.
[19011.42s -> 19011.82s]  We will.
[19015.53s -> 19017.21s]  Yeah we have exponentially improved.
[19018.78s -> 19020.54s]  This was a 0-3 stream.
[19020.54s -> 19022.06s]  It's now a 2-1 stream.
[19023.18s -> 19026.86s]  Imagine improving by 2-300%.
[19028.14s -> 19029.66s]  Over the course of five hours.
[19030.67s -> 19032.11s]  That's a large increase.
[19032.83s -> 19056.64s]  200% of zero is zero.
[19056.64s -> 19058.32s]  Now the zero and three was like...
[19059.87s -> 19061.23s]  It wasn't actually zero.
[19061.23s -> 19062.67s]  It was like zero point...
[19062.67s -> 19063.47s]  What the hell was that?
[19065.88s -> 19066.38s]  Oh.
[19075.12s -> 19080.30s]  It was like 0.4-3.
[19081.26s -> 19083.26s]  So 200% of that is like...
[19083.26s -> 19084.06s]  We're doing fine.
[19091.32s -> 19094.01s]  That's the wrong one.
[19094.01s -> 19095.53s]  You picked the wrong one to do that too.
[19097.53s -> 19106.16s]  Mathematically it was zero but emotionally it was a bigger number.
[19106.16s -> 19106.66s]  Yes.
[19107.36s -> 19118.62s]  Okay.
[19118.62s -> 19121.82s]  I think I'm gonna just throw out the weaponized pinata.
[19121.82s -> 19124.91s]  In fact I am.
[19127.79s -> 19136.44s]  This is a good Fortnite reference.
[19137.08s -> 19140.43s]  Have you guys even ever played Fortnite?
[19140.43s -> 19143.15s]  I see so many references but I don't think you guys even play it.
[19152.92s -> 19153.64s]  Ooh.
[19153.64s -> 19154.52s]  All right.
[19154.52s -> 19155.32s]  What's more important?
[19156.12s -> 19159.16s]  Two and two and a two cost minion or getting a taunt out and hitting the face?
[19161.21s -> 19161.93s]  That's cooler to me.
[19162.81s -> 19170.00s]  Things are looking up.
[19175.29s -> 19176.81s]  A good bolderfist ogre coming out next.
[19177.53s -> 19187.77s]  Do I get these next turn?
[19187.77s -> 19192.25s]  My remedies are all natural.
[19193.61s -> 19194.81s]  No he has to trade.
[19195.61s -> 19196.72s]  He's gonna lose both.
[19199.50s -> 19201.50s]  I mean yeah he can draw all he wants.
[19201.50s -> 19204.62s]  He's dead next turn.
[19209.69s -> 19211.29s]  Where did he get this like synergy from?
[19212.01s -> 19228.62s]  This is a pretty good spot.
[19229.18s -> 19238.32s]  He drew a bunch of cards.
[19238.32s -> 19247.13s]  Right now he's thinking oh fuck he's got big damage.
[19247.13s -> 19248.73s]  See I'm all right with that.
[19248.73s -> 19250.17s]  We're getting the legendary out of this.
[19250.81s -> 19252.80s]  He had to take a lot of hits for that.
[19252.80s -> 19253.28s]  What do we got?
[19256.67s -> 19257.95s]  Varian Rin.
[19258.67s -> 19263.85s]  Hahaha that could be the victory right there.
[19267.32s -> 19270.68s]  I mean we're gonna obviously we're gonna divine shield the ogre right?
[19270.68s -> 19271.96s]  I mean we got a good play here.
[19273.48s -> 19277.90s]  Divine shield the ogre taunt or taunt divine shield the taunt.
[19287.79s -> 19289.39s]  And then get it out here.
[19299.53s -> 19300.57s]  Next we got Varian.
[19318.01s -> 19320.97s]  That's that don't matter because you ready for this?
[19323.84s -> 19324.88s]  You still have to get through that.
[19325.44s -> 19330.46s]  I'm not gonna I'm not no no no no that's a mistake.
[19331.10s -> 19332.51s]  I'm not gonna play Varian.
[19332.51s -> 19333.63s]  No we're just gonna go face.
[19334.27s -> 19336.38s]  You gotta get through and I got I got the quality.
[19341.02s -> 19343.63s]  Six get rid of you.
[19357.50s -> 19359.66s]  That's there's too many people on the board.
[19360.78s -> 19361.58s]  No I'm not playing it yet.
[19362.72s -> 19363.28s]  I'm not gonna play it.
[19363.28s -> 19364.08s]  No no I'm not playing it.
[19364.08s -> 19365.76s]  There's four there's gonna be I've just draw.
[19366.40s -> 19369.98s]  Should I play it?
[19369.98s -> 19371.42s]  Next turn next turn I'm doing next turn.
[19390.24s -> 19390.96s]  God damn it.
[19393.44s -> 19393.92s]  It's all right.
[19399.45s -> 19400.25s]  Check this shit out.
[19400.25s -> 19401.13s]  You ready?
[19401.13s -> 19405.37s]  I'm gonna I'm gonna equality right now and kill everything.
[19405.37s -> 19407.45s]  And then I'm gonna play Varian next turn.
[19407.45s -> 19415.07s]  Don't do it now.
[19415.07s -> 19417.44s]  I'm doing it right now.
[19425.56s -> 19426.06s]  Good.
[19427.98s -> 19428.46s]  Not good.
[19429.18s -> 19430.89s]  Pretty good.
[19430.89s -> 19433.53s]  All right now we just go face and fucking win the game.
[19446.76s -> 19449.00s]  I got too much with this too much going on here.
[19449.00s -> 19465.82s]  It's too overwhelming and I still have equality.
[19465.82s -> 19466.94s]  16 what's he got?
[19467.82s -> 19468.86s]  What the fuck is this?
[19469.58s -> 19471.42s]  How did you get two of these?
[19471.42s -> 19473.18s]  Hold on what do I have for health?
[19473.98s -> 19479.05s]  How much does this cost?
[19479.05s -> 19480.49s]  That's a six cost minion.
[19481.53s -> 19493.26s]  All right so we've got three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven.

[19559.52s -> 19560.80s]  Oh god give me a break.

[19586.48s -> 19588.72s]  Four five six seven eight nine.

[19686.64s -> 19688.70s]  Oh my consecration and I win.
[19689.58s -> 19695.56s]  He forgot about the dragons.
[19696.12s -> 19697.93s]  Oh and then you get equality.
[19701.12s -> 19702.00s]  Equality.
[19702.00s -> 19702.72s]  Dead.
[19702.72s -> 19703.36s]  Two dragons.

[19711.76s -> 19712.96s]  Noble sacrifice and fuck it.
[19737.95s -> 19740.91s]  I can't like play this with people like watching.
[19740.91s -> 19742.27s]  I seriously.
[19743.71s -> 19746.83s]  I look over I just like I can't focus on the game.
[19749.68s -> 19751.60s]  It's like I need to like concentrate.
[19763.45s -> 19764.41s]  Well there it is.
[19764.41s -> 19766.97s]  Thanks for it fucking five turns late.
[19766.97s -> 19786.28s]  I should have even used the equality.
[19786.28s -> 19787.96s]  Now we're just topdecking against each other.
[19787.96s -> 19788.52s]  I could have won.
[19800.67s -> 19805.71s]  Yeah and I'm also playing with like fucking anvils on my back.
[19805.71s -> 19807.31s]  Look at this guy's deck.

[19809.15s -> 19813.44s]  I've I've like dragon anvils with this deck.
[19814.08s -> 19832.01s]  I finally played the goblin.
[19832.01s -> 19832.81s]  Oh well.
[19832.81s -> 19847.71s]  I think he's healed like 14-15 times this game.
[19848.75s -> 19856.04s]  Does it still be impossible?
[19857.08s -> 19864.33s]  Why do I have coins?
[19864.97s -> 19881.80s]  What else do I have in here?
[19882.36s -> 19883.82s]  I really could have won too.
[19883.82s -> 19885.50s]  Just I get too overwhelmed.
[19886.14s -> 19891.40s]  This is why I don't play this game.

[19908.56s -> 19909.84s]  Hey it ain't over yet.
[19931.84s -> 19935.53s]  It's this this turned into a top deck war.
[19935.53s -> 19937.77s]  Because I didn't play the goblin and half lethal.
[19945.72s -> 19957.29s]  One of us gets something big it's over.

[20086.54s -> 20087.71s]  He's gonna hit me twice.
[20087.71s -> 20088.19s]  I need to heal.

[20115.93s -> 20117.61s]  I have to trade everything.
[20120.75s -> 20121.47s]  Use the coin.
[20121.47s -> 20122.83s]  The coin doesn't do anything.
[20123.47s -> 20141.44s]  This is the most clown dog shit fucking game ever.
[20141.44s -> 20147.04s]  I need something I need something ridiculous.

[20207.82s -> 20209.18s]  I'm so sad right now.
[20209.82s -> 20214.70s]  This is like watching a car crash in slow motion.
[20214.70s -> 20217.02s]  This is like watching a car crash in fast motion.
[20224.97s -> 20227.85s]  All right I'm gonna throw five and three.
[20232.80s -> 20233.76s]  Coin croc-a-lisk.

[20401.36s -> 20406.91s]  The cars that I played with don't even exist anymore.
[20406.91s -> 20408.28s]  I remember this one.

[20531.85s -> 20534.81s]  He's going to clear everything.
[20535.37s -> 20538.56s]  I mean I just have to do this right?

[20624.89s -> 20628.11s]  Somebody got to fuck you in right before it happened.
[20636.01s -> 20637.37s]  You don't deserve my cake.
[20638.09s -> 20642.68s]  What's what's going on?
[20643.24s -> 20645.26s]  He just released a house?
[20645.98s -> 20651.40s]  Well that's all right because I got bang bang.

[20736.73s -> 20740.83s]  He has to kill something and I've got doctor blast.
[20741.39s -> 20746.70s]  He has to get rid of everything.
[20749.04s -> 20750.08s]  That's a fucking mech.
[20750.08s -> 20750.88s]  Did I just lose?
[20751.60s -> 20752.72s]  No I didn't just lose.
[20752.72s -> 20753.92s]  I can't fucking believe it.
[20755.85s -> 20756.81s]  Oh my god.
[20756.81s -> 20757.85s]  I can't fucking believe it.
[20761.40s -> 20762.52s]  That's great synergy.
[20762.52s -> 20765.80s]  I don't have a single fucking synergy card in the entire deck.
[20766.60s -> 20767.80s]  In the whole deck.
[20779.58s -> 20781.26s]  I don't whatever it's over.
[20791.74s -> 20792.22s]  No I won.
[20793.50s -> 20794.62s]  I just won the game.
[20794.62s -> 20798.11s]  I just won the game with one health.
[20803.34s -> 20804.70s]  Wait wait wait just make sure I have it.
[20811.08s -> 20811.96s]  There you go guys.
[20811.96s -> 20814.28s]  Oh yeah okay he's not even very good at the video game.
[20814.28s -> 20815.80s]  He's not even I don't think he's very good at this.
[20816.52s -> 20820.33s]  All right take it off emote only they're behaving.
[20839.92s -> 20840.80s]  You guys.
[20840.80s -> 20842.56s]  Would you like some of my cake?
[20842.56s -> 20848.46s]  I made it special for you.
[20848.46s -> 20849.74s]  I made it special for you guys.
[20850.54s -> 20866.78s]  My stream was crashing because of the emotes.
[20868.03s -> 20869.31s]  See I'm saving you.
[20869.31s -> 20872.97s]  I'm okay with three and three that's even.
[20872.97s -> 20874.09s]  No that's not hello.
[20874.97s -> 20876.33s]  I tried to say where's hello.
[20879.39s -> 20881.39s]  That's like ultimate ultra BM.
[20881.39s -> 20899.58s]  Like I but I did not turn one coin.
[20899.58s -> 20905.40s]  That's right not gonna really okay.
[20911.61s -> 20912.41s]  I can do that too.
[20913.13s -> 20921.56s]  Am I gonna get absolutely fucked if I start playing this game without spending money?
[20924.35s -> 20928.51s]  No they give you they give you packs.
[20928.51s -> 20939.98s]  They do you get like five to ten packs.
[20942.09s -> 20943.13s]  I mean you could do a Reno.
[20950.14s -> 20952.14s]  Actually rank 50 is pretty fair.
[20957.48s -> 20958.92s]  Let's keep the control up here.
[20961.21s -> 20963.21s]  I wonder do you think he's got like a polymorph?
[20963.21s -> 20964.81s]  Should I get this out there right now?
[20964.81s -> 20967.21s]  Or should I throw out the herald and face?
[20967.85s -> 20975.58s]  I'm gonna herald and face or spell word and haste.
[20977.02s -> 20982.28s]  Go back to Mario Yahtzee.
[20982.28s -> 20985.48s]  I already dominated that game to a point where I don't even care anymore.
[20985.96s -> 20995.36s]  I'm gonna bring in a gurubashi berserker.
[20998.32s -> 21003.93s]  Now this is a scenario where I'm gonna potentially equality this.
[21004.57s -> 21005.85s]  No I could.
[21006.49s -> 21007.80s]  It wouldn't be that bad.
[21008.52s -> 21011.21s]  I'm not sure that would be the worst thing.
[21013.39s -> 21014.91s]  Or to get the tuskar out here.
[21033.24s -> 21045.47s]  Okay next turn with murloc and hero power.
[21058.46s -> 21061.68s]  Next spell we got oh that's not good playing cannon.
[21061.68s -> 21061.92s]  Fuck.
[21067.61s -> 21083.07s]  No okay I could do sword and I could do sword and equality and kill this.
[21084.80s -> 21085.84s]  That keeps me alive.
[21091.39s -> 21098.04s]  Or sword and oh fuck equality's four mana.
[21101.24s -> 21102.44s]  Shit I don't know what to do.
[21103.08s -> 21108.22s]  I think I'm just gonna have to do murloc and hit hero power.
[21116.36s -> 21117.88s]  I'm itching my head again.
[21125.50s -> 21131.84s]  It is sending just stuff to die but I need to put I have to have something here.
[21131.84s -> 21133.60s]  Otherwise he's just gonna start to destroy me.
[21134.16s -> 21138.70s]  And it is a terrible murloc but at least it's not terrible.
[21138.70s -> 21139.58s]  Still plenty of cards.
[21148.43s -> 21150.51s]  Interesting.
[21151.61s -> 21153.77s]  He wants to keep this alive so he can do that.
[21155.56s -> 21155.80s]  Okay.
[21162.91s -> 21163.55s]  All right.
[21177.79s -> 21180.35s]  Ogre and gloatron I think is the only thing I can do.
[21187.26s -> 21189.23s]  You have to get rid of it.
[21192.51s -> 21194.59s]  I'm happy I'm here for Jeremy to teach the game.
[21194.59s -> 21196.43s]  Yeah I've got some strategies here.
[21197.15s -> 21199.52s]  He lost every game.
[21199.52s -> 21200.16s]  That's a lie.
[21200.16s -> 21201.04s]  Don't listen to that.
[21201.04s -> 21202.40s]  I'm three and two right now.
[21203.36s -> 21206.24s]  At least be truthful about it.
[21207.20s -> 21214.72s]  He thought about it.
[21214.72s -> 21215.44s]  He's not trading.
[21216.32s -> 21218.33s]  Huh.
[21221.64s -> 21227.95s]  So just get some minions on the board and fucking what does this do?
[21227.95s -> 21232.03s]  Whenever you cast dispel summon random three cost beast that's not good.
[21232.03s -> 21240.09s]  I think it is time for equality.
[21244.32s -> 21245.76s]  It's time for equality.
[21257.08s -> 21257.80s]  Trade first.
[21259.55s -> 21261.39s]  I mean doesn't it does not matter.
[21264.57s -> 21264.97s]  I guess.
[21271.87s -> 21276.99s]  Not that one.
[21278.46s -> 21279.18s]  Wrong trade.
[21287.26s -> 21290.46s]  You guys saying the robot and I thought it was the rope.
[21291.42s -> 21291.90s]  Whatever.
[21292.46s -> 21297.45s]  I'm gonna stick to peeing my pants on stream.
[21297.45s -> 21298.33s]  That's probably easier.
[21302.62s -> 21303.10s]  That's it.
[21303.10s -> 21303.50s]  I lose.
[21304.22s -> 21326.75s]  Should have drawn I wish I drew consecration in six games.
[21326.75s -> 21327.39s]  That would be fun.
[21344.44s -> 21345.40s]  All right.
[21345.40s -> 21345.96s]  That's it.
[21357.00s -> 21358.12s]  No no more arena.
[21358.12s -> 21362.68s]  Arena just like I was like happy and chipper when we were playing
[21363.32s -> 21368.76s]  in the solo adventure and then I go to arena and I play against players that have cards
[21368.76s -> 21379.20s]  and it becomes a disaster.
[21379.20s -> 21382.30s]  No actually I had a lot of fun.
[21382.30s -> 21386.62s]  I'm so happy that I streamed this game for one reason for the comedic purpose
[21387.26s -> 21391.82s]  of being the number one Hearthstone streamer on Twitch for like 45 minutes
[21392.38s -> 21396.60s]  or like a couple hours or something and having ranked 25 next to my name.
[21396.60s -> 21398.20s]  That was just worth it completely.
[21400.51s -> 21401.23s]  It just was.
[21414.30s -> 21419.64s]  I was in the number one spot for like what 20 minutes or 30 minutes or something
[21422.01s -> 21423.76s]  but that's gonna be it.
[21423.76s -> 21427.04s]  That brings us right to like a nice perfect clean six hours.
[21438.01s -> 21439.85s]  It's fun to do this every once in a while.
[21439.85s -> 21443.60s]  Play like the game that a lot of people play.
[21446.84s -> 21451.24s]  Even if I wasn't playing that well and it was just kind of all over the place.
[21451.24s -> 21452.12s]  I still had a lot of fun.
[21452.12s -> 21452.92s]  It was fucking great.
[21457.48s -> 21460.44s]  So tomorrow we are never going to see this again.
[21461.32s -> 21461.88s]  I'm gonna get...
[21462.60s -> 21463.56s]  Good night everybody.
[21463.56s -> 21464.28s]  See you next time.
[21464.28s -> 21465.00s]  See you tomorrow.
[21465.00s -> 21466.84s]  I'm gonna play Cooking Simulator tomorrow.
[21466.84s -> 21467.64s]  Have a great day.
[21467.64s -> 21468.84s]  Have a great night guys.
[21468.84s -> 21471.16s]  This dream is gonna turn up and I'm just gonna scream into my hands.
[21475.04s -> 21475.28s]  No.
[21477.18s -> 21478.70s]  Tomorrow we're gonna come back.
[21478.70s -> 21481.42s]  I was supposed to play Cooking Simulator today but it wasn't out.
[21482.22s -> 21490.36s]  So tomorrow is gonna be even more probably of a shitshow
[21490.36s -> 21492.28s]  but the game actually releases tomorrow.
[21492.28s -> 21493.96s]  It's the only reason why I'm not playing it today.
[21493.96s -> 21498.35s]  Do you have any plans to play...
[21499.31s -> 21501.79s]  Okay, I'm gonna give you my actual classic wild plan.
[21503.29s -> 21506.22s]  I probably am just gonna play it off stream.
[21506.22s -> 21509.10s]  And on stream maybe sometimes when we do something fun.
[21510.17s -> 21514.09s]  Maybe we'll try to like raid Ogramar or something with like 50 people.
[21514.73s -> 21517.93s]  Just try to take over the capital or something for like certain streams.
[21517.93s -> 21518.73s]  Might be fun to do.
[21523.05s -> 21527.61s]  But off stream I plan on just kind of casually playing it.
[21527.61s -> 21528.57s]  I'll probably make a guild.
[21529.69s -> 21532.17s]  I'll let everybody know the server I'm on if you guys want to play it.
[21532.65s -> 21535.53s]  Just have like a group of people that just play it off and on.
[21535.53s -> 21544.59s]  Should be fun.
[21545.23s -> 21546.03s]  Looking forward to it.
[21547.93s -> 21552.01s]  Try to actually take down like Onyxio or something on stream with chat.
[21554.16s -> 21560.38s]  Whatever the guild is try to do it without any voice over IP and like no communication.
[21560.38s -> 21562.09s]  It would be fucking hilarious.
[21568.22s -> 21570.06s]  But I'll see you tomorrow if you take it up.
[21570.06s -> 21572.54s]  I'm gonna go just take a quick pee break.
[21572.54s -> 21573.18s]  I'll be right back.
[21574.25s -> 21576.73s]  And we'll do the bits and the subs and everything.
[21576.73s -> 21577.85s]  There was a shitload of subs.
[21577.85s -> 21579.21s]  There was a ton of fucking money.
[21579.21s -> 21582.17s]  I know it was like a little like sub train and stuff in the beginning.
[21582.17s -> 21583.87s]  And we were making jokes about it.
[21583.87s -> 21588.54s]  But that was a lot of subs and a lot of fucking money in the beginning of the stream.
[21588.54s -> 21589.26s]  Hope you enjoyed it.
[21589.26s -> 21590.62s]  As always, I had a blast.
[21590.62s -> 21593.72s]  At least I got to three wins.
[21593.72s -> 21595.88s]  Thank you for watching.
[21595.88s -> 21600.30s]  I'll see you tomorrow for Cooking Simulator.
[21600.30s -> 21602.59s]  Don't miss it.
[21602.59s -> 21603.87s]  I will be right back.
[21603.87s -> 21771.90s]  See you soon.
[21771.90s -> 21772.70s]  All right.
[21772.70s -> 21777.15s]  Hey, what is this mic peak?
[21780.88s -> 21781.28s]  Save it.
[21782.32s -> 21783.76s]  I've been a manual save in a while.
[21787.37s -> 21788.57s]  That kind of wasn't mic peak.
[21788.57s -> 21788.97s]  You're right.
[21790.89s -> 21791.69s]  Angry chat.
[21793.60s -> 21794.32s]  What are these clips?
[21794.96s -> 21798.46s]  You are going to get frustrated on this stream.
[21799.18s -> 21800.62s]  You're going to be mad at me.
[21800.62s -> 21801.98s]  You're going to yell at me.
[21801.98s -> 21803.34s]  You're going to call me names.
[21804.78s -> 21805.42s]  Anything else?
[21805.42s -> 21808.22s]  And I'm going to puff my chest out and be like, yeah, right.
[21809.18s -> 21810.70s]  I kind of did that a few times.
[21819.72s -> 21819.96s]  All right.
[21819.96s -> 21820.76s]  Let me get off like that.
[21830.54s -> 21833.58s]  Let's get the correct screen on.
[21833.58s -> 21834.22s]  Why not, right?
[21839.08s -> 21841.56s]  Let's go over the bits from earlier.
[21843.42s -> 21844.94s]  We had so many...
[21844.94s -> 21846.62s]  Just wait till you see the subs fly by.
[21847.42s -> 21848.88s]  They are going to...
[21849.44s -> 21850.32s]  Oh, my God.
[21851.84s -> 21852.96s]  This is ridiculous.
[21855.18s -> 21858.46s]  I'm scrolling fucking forever.
[21858.46s -> 21861.02s]  How many subs there were today for community sub?
[21864.17s -> 21864.49s]  Wow.
[21870.75s -> 21871.23s]  Yeah.
[21871.23s -> 21873.15s]  When you see the credits, just wait till you see these fly by.
[21873.79s -> 21877.02s]  Anyways, let's start back here.
[21877.02s -> 21878.94s]  About six plus.
[21878.94s -> 21880.70s]  A little six over six hours ago or so.
[21882.06s -> 21885.34s]  We had a cut tag for the $8.
[21885.34s -> 21886.62s]  Thank you for eight bucks.
[21887.72s -> 21888.44s]  Whoa, dude.
[21888.44s -> 21889.08s]  Nice card.
[21889.08s -> 21891.56s]  I got like three legendaries and 20 packs.
[21891.56s -> 21892.92s]  That's actually really fucking good.
[21892.92s -> 21893.72s]  That's really good.
[21894.84s -> 21901.93s]  But thank you.
[21901.93s -> 21902.41s]  Cut tag.
[21903.05s -> 21903.69s]  Oh, gee.
[21903.69s -> 21904.17s]  Jeff Durr.
[21904.17s -> 21904.89s]  Thanks for the $10.
[21906.65s -> 21908.65s]  Says he doesn't want to get hyped and energetic,
[21908.65s -> 21910.89s]  but then today he is screaming in the first 30 minutes.
[21914.24s -> 21916.80s]  Yeah, but like my brain is hyped up, but my body isn't.
[21916.80s -> 21917.60s]  I get to just kind of...
[21920.20s -> 21920.52s]  Whatever.
[21920.52s -> 21921.16s]  The other way around.
[21926.14s -> 21926.78s]  It's comfy.
[21929.71s -> 21931.71s]  I'm comfortable, you know?
[21932.75s -> 21933.95s]  Even if I yell a little bit,
[21933.95s -> 21935.95s]  I use my nasal patches just for the air to come out,
[21935.95s -> 21936.99s]  not my stomach, so I'm fine.
[21937.55s -> 21943.36s]  Hopefully he did well in Hearthstone.
[21943.36s -> 21944.08s]  Nobody tell him.
[21945.53s -> 21946.57s]  Nobody tell him.
[21946.57s -> 21952.30s]  But thank you, OG Jeff Durr for the 10 bucks.
[21953.02s -> 21955.20s]  Really appreciate it.
[21957.95s -> 21961.68s]  And then I think I missed this earlier.
[21961.68s -> 21963.84s]  Some guy gave another $50 earlier.
[21964.40s -> 21966.24s]  It's a Doom OST or Riot.
[21966.80s -> 21968.88s]  Thank you for the huge amount of money.
[21968.88s -> 21970.72s]  It was $150, I think, today.
[21970.72s -> 21972.80s]  Yeah, just look at the fucking board.
[21975.02s -> 21975.74s]  My god.
[21978.91s -> 21982.35s]  There was hundreds of dollars just running in at the same time.
[21984.17s -> 21985.53s]  I'm sorry I missed something if I did.
[21986.49s -> 21987.45s]  But thank you nonetheless.
[21990.36s -> 21991.64s]  So many community subs.
[21992.68s -> 21995.00s]  Thank you dot me.
[21995.00s -> 21996.20s]  Dot is me.
[21996.20s -> 21998.28s]  Dot see me for the $5.
[21999.56s -> 22001.00s]  And they just say hype.
[22003.00s -> 22003.32s]  Hype.
[22004.06s -> 22004.78s]  Yes.
[22004.78s -> 22005.50s]  Yes, yes, yes.
[22006.06s -> 22009.64s]  They also say pride 100.
[22009.64s -> 22015.61s]  Thank you for the $5.
[22015.61s -> 22017.29s]  Thank you hack it fast for $10.
[22018.57s -> 22019.69s]  Hack it fast.
[22019.69s -> 22021.05s]  Recommend me a good whiskey.
[22021.05s -> 22022.25s]  Also, I eat ass.
[22023.68s -> 22024.88s]  Oh, I got that earlier.
[22024.88s -> 22025.52s]  Yeah.
[22025.52s -> 22027.84s]  If you want to spend a lot of money, Johnny Walker Blue.
[22027.84s -> 22031.44s]  If you want to spend a little bit about like $30, $40 a bottle,
[22031.44s -> 22033.44s]  Johnny Walker Black, Johnny Walker Red.
[22033.44s -> 22036.32s]  Johnny Walker is just good if you like whiskey.
[22037.36s -> 22039.08s]  Mike said about E3.
[22039.08s -> 22040.20s]  I'm going to come covering E3.
[22040.20s -> 22042.44s]  We're getting a full on professional coverage from me.
[22044.67s -> 22045.87s]  Don't suggest red.
[22047.95s -> 22048.67s]  No, it depends.
[22048.67s -> 22049.79s]  You know, some people just want to,
[22050.51s -> 22054.75s]  you want to spend like, you know, 25, 30 bucks on a bottle of alcohol.
[22058.62s -> 22061.50s]  Johnny Walker is like saying to drink Budweiser if you like lagers.
[22061.50s -> 22061.74s]  What?
[22063.23s -> 22065.23s]  Johnny Walker Blue is really good.
[22072.84s -> 22075.64s]  Johnny Walker Blue is a very, very high quality alcohol.
[22083.10s -> 22085.02s]  I mean, it's not like Jack Daniels.
[22085.74s -> 22087.58s]  The dude that does two different kinds of,
[22087.58s -> 22088.78s]  those two different things, but.
[22094.75s -> 22097.23s]  Jack Daniels is the Budweiser of whiskey.
[22097.95s -> 22099.31s]  I'm going to have to disagree with you on that.
[22102.41s -> 22103.37s]  It's all the same shit.
[22103.37s -> 22106.01s]  Just go get a jug of vodka for five bucks.
[22108.09s -> 22118.70s]  You could, but thank you.
[22118.70s -> 22119.90s]  Hack it fast.
[22119.90s -> 22128.62s]  Also, Glen Fetich is another great one if you like whiskey.
[22133.13s -> 22134.57s]  Whiskey tastes like a house fire.
[22145.98s -> 22148.46s]  Hey, quats or cats.
[22148.46s -> 22149.74s]  Thanks for $5.
[22150.54s -> 22150.86s]  Sorry.
[22150.86s -> 22154.54s]  I'm just a, just a common $500 bit donation in that pack.
[22155.26s -> 22162.72s]  If you were here in the beginning of the stream,
[22162.72s -> 22165.92s]  when I was opening the packs, $50 would come out.
[22166.56s -> 22170.04s]  I would open a card pack and like 20 community subs would show up.
[22171.29s -> 22174.25s]  Sorry, just a common 500 bit donation in that one.
[22176.64s -> 22178.56s]  $5 is still a lot of money to give anybody.
[22179.12s -> 22180.48s]  Thank you for $5.
[22181.12s -> 22184.44s]  I'm honored to accept it.
[22184.44s -> 22188.92s]  Oh, I hear a little barking auto.
[22191.10s -> 22193.10s]  Thank you also to cats again for $5.
[22193.10s -> 22194.62s]  They say pride 500 and then.
[22195.50s -> 22202.03s]  Uh, beater, beater, auto.
[22202.03s -> 22202.75s]  What are you barking at?
[22202.75s -> 22207.32s]  He never barks like this.
[22212.43s -> 22213.07s]  Listen to him.
[22213.07s -> 22213.47s]  He doesn't.
[22213.47s -> 22214.91s]  I've never heard him bark like that.
[22215.63s -> 22216.84s]  Hold on.
[22216.84s -> 22217.40s]  Can you hear that?
[22218.04s -> 22220.17s]  He never barks.
[22222.73s -> 22223.05s]  Hold on.
[22223.05s -> 22223.45s]  Let me go.
[22224.41s -> 22225.21s]  Hold on.
[22225.21s -> 22225.77s]  Let me go see.
[22225.77s -> 22226.57s]  Let me go investigate it.
[22226.57s -> 22226.97s]  We're back.
[22227.61s -> 22267.58s]  Yeah, it's just, it was an intruder.
[22267.58s -> 22269.50s]  I just like, I fucking punched him all the way.
[22269.50s -> 22271.82s]  He flew all the way to the police station and they put him in handcuffs.
[22279.37s -> 22280.49s]  That was Kim.
[22280.49s -> 22284.04s]  She was just, uh, she was outside.
[22284.28s -> 22285.16s]  Now she's back inside.
[22285.72s -> 22293.15s]  I got my Hearthstone sponsor check.
[22293.15s -> 22296.01s]  I, no, I did not.
[22298.83s -> 22300.27s]  No, I did not.
[22300.91s -> 22302.11s]  No, no, no, no.
[22302.11s -> 22302.91s]  All right.
[22302.91s -> 22304.11s]  Thank you for the bits.
[22304.11s -> 22304.67s]  Here we go.
[22307.71s -> 22310.19s]  Uh, we got $19.50.
[22310.19s -> 22312.27s]  50, it was $50 so many times.
[22312.27s -> 22313.63s]  You guys are fucking so generous.
[22313.63s -> 22314.03s]  Thank you.
[22316.19s -> 22317.47s]  Jamie, 2803.
[22317.47s -> 22318.43s]  Thanks for the $10.
[22318.43s -> 22319.71s]  They say, Jerome Hart.
[22320.27s -> 22321.60s]  Thank you for the 10 bucks.
[22327.24s -> 22328.52s]  There's a little room right there.
[22329.84s -> 22331.20s]  A flair pancake.
[22331.20s -> 22332.40s]  Thanks for the $2.75.
[22333.28s -> 22336.28s]  Hey, Jerome, I'm back from my trip to the Philippines.
[22336.28s -> 22341.16s]  I had a great time, but the whole time I was worried that without my constant attention,
[22341.16s -> 22343.08s]  you'd turn into some normie streamer.
[22343.88s -> 22345.80s]  Sorry, Jerome, I won't let this happen again.
[22346.60s -> 22358.80s]  It didn't happen.
[22358.80s -> 22359.52s]  It was you.
[22360.32s -> 22362.28s]  It didn't happen.
[22362.92s -> 22363.72s]  It didn't come true.
[22367.63s -> 22368.03s]  Whatever.
[22368.03s -> 22369.79s]  I played Hearthstone on one stream.
[22370.59s -> 22373.44s]  Oh, what's the big deal?
[22373.44s -> 22378.96s]  I played Hearthstone for like fucking five and a half hours, one time.
[22379.60s -> 22380.97s]  I just wanted to do it.
[22380.97s -> 22383.77s]  We just fucking throwing the feelers out, guys.
[22384.49s -> 22387.10s]  I had a good time.
[22387.74s -> 22399.15s]  No, you did.
[22399.15s -> 22399.63s]  Yes, I did.
[22403.90s -> 22404.86s]  I thought it was fun.
[22408.51s -> 22409.55s]  I had a lot of fun too.
[22411.28s -> 22413.28s]  This is definitely not the worst stream.
[22413.28s -> 22413.76s]  Yeah, what?
[22413.76s -> 22416.56s]  You're going to put this in the 2019 worst stream category?
[22417.28s -> 22420.30s]  No, I call bullshit on that one.
[22430.52s -> 22434.75s]  Worse than days gone?
[22434.75s -> 22436.67s]  I'm sorry, but that is not correct.
[22437.23s -> 22443.42s]  Days gone was fun too.
[22443.42s -> 22447.26s]  There hasn't even been a candidate for 2019 worst stream.
[22447.26s -> 22450.30s]  I'm on a roll this year.
[22450.30s -> 22451.10s]  What was that?
[22451.10s -> 22452.38s]  There really hasn't been.
[22452.38s -> 22456.38s]  Has there been like a worst of 2019 stream?
[22462.16s -> 22464.48s]  We are going into the middle of June.
[22465.12s -> 22470.49s]  I did.
[22470.49s -> 22472.25s]  I played Mario Tennis last year.
[22472.25s -> 22486.60s]  I'm on a roll this year.
[22487.68s -> 22491.44s]  I could give you at least two or three by the time we got to March last year.
[22492.16s -> 22496.73s]  Must be that fucking fresh Vegas air.
[22497.55s -> 22500.51s]  Vegas air quality is like some of the worst in the country.
[22500.51s -> 22506.97s]  I think it's up there somewhere.
[22508.80s -> 22509.76s]  Air is overrated.
[22510.40s -> 22512.94s]  But anyways, I have a lot of fun.
[22512.94s -> 22513.26s]  I did.
[22513.98s -> 22515.32s]  I really did.
[22515.32s -> 22517.72s]  You can tell that I'm not having fun because I'm not like engaging
[22517.72s -> 22518.84s]  and I'm just sitting there like whatever.
[22519.80s -> 22524.96s]  Okay, so yeah, I think I'm going to move on.
[22524.96s -> 22525.84s]  I'm going to do something else.
[22527.37s -> 22530.56s]  Great fucking time with all of you.
[22530.56s -> 22530.88s]  Okay.
[22543.48s -> 22545.24s]  There was a moment where you screamed at chat.
[22545.24s -> 22546.36s]  Are you excited?
[22548.64s -> 22550.24s]  Yeah, like I was excited.
[22550.24s -> 22552.72s]  I was just checking to see if you were also excited too.
[22552.72s -> 22554.24s]  And at least 40 people wrote it.
[22561.79s -> 22564.51s]  But anyways, let's get closer to the end here.
[22566.81s -> 22568.41s]  But welcome back.
[22568.41s -> 22570.17s]  That was FlarePancake for $2.75.
[22570.97s -> 22573.84s]  Hope you had fun on your trip to the Philippines.
[22574.48s -> 22577.50s]  And we also had Tingy.
[22577.50s -> 22578.78s]  $2.50 from Tingy.
[22578.78s -> 22581.10s]  I'm sorry this is a little too low effort.
[22581.10s -> 22582.94s]  I did only a couple minutes to make it.
[22582.94s -> 22584.46s]  This is your chat in a nutshell.
[22585.90s -> 22586.70s]  Chat in a nutshell.
[22586.70s -> 22587.02s]  Let's see.
[22588.83s -> 22591.07s]  Doesn't it seem a little harsh to kill someone over a crown?
[22591.23s -> 22592.51s]  You don't understand.
[22592.51s -> 22595.55s]  My crown is a symbol of my king-like authority.
[22595.55s -> 22599.87s]  And between you and me, my hair is thinning a bit.
[22599.87s -> 22600.91s]  Oh, your highness.
[22600.91s -> 22602.35s]  I'm sure it's not that noticeable.
[22622.89s -> 22624.73s]  I'm not even fucking bald.
[22635.12s -> 22639.52s]  All right.
[22639.52s -> 22643.28s]  I can understand if I had like a fryer tuck on the top of my head.
[22649.64s -> 22650.28s]  Thank you, Tingy.
[22650.28s -> 22651.88s]  That was funny.
[22651.88s -> 22654.03s]  Show the hairline right now.
[22654.03s -> 22654.35s]  I can't.
[22654.35s -> 22654.83s]  I'm naked.
[22656.35s -> 22657.71s]  Your deck sucks and you're bald.
[22657.71s -> 22658.11s]  Oh, yeah.
[22658.11s -> 22658.51s]  I forgot.
[22658.51s -> 22664.51s]  Somebody wrote that.
[22664.51s -> 22665.71s]  So vicious.
[22665.71s -> 22666.83s]  So mean.
[22666.83s -> 22667.87s]  So vicious.
[22668.67s -> 22672.11s]  How did I raise such vicious children?
[22672.67s -> 22682.28s]  We've learned it from you.
[22682.28s -> 22683.00s]  No, you didn't.
[22683.00s -> 22685.16s]  I said, have a great night.
[22685.16s -> 22687.80s]  Hope you have a good time and take care, guys.
[22687.80s -> 22693.23s]  How did I raise such vicious, vicious children?
[22693.23s -> 22704.33s]  Am I going to get a Death Stranding stream?
[22707.47s -> 22708.35s]  Maybe.
[22708.35s -> 22709.58s]  Probably.
[22710.46s -> 22711.26s]  Looks interesting.
[22716.25s -> 22720.97s]  There are a couple of big games that are coming out that I know I'll be playing.
[22721.61s -> 22726.36s]  We talked about Cyberpunk 2077 last night.
[22726.36s -> 22728.36s]  And whenever that comes out, absolutely.
[22729.00s -> 22732.80s]  Can we get a Pac-Man stream?
[22732.80s -> 22739.20s]  I'd love to just go back and play that Super Nintendo Pac-Man is a moron game
[22739.20s -> 22744.25s]  and try to actually beat it.
[22744.81s -> 22747.52s]  It would be hell on earth, but I would try.
[22747.52s -> 22753.12s]  But yeah.
[22758.66s -> 22771.58s]  Uh, Tom, Tom York's sleazy eye dot.
[22771.58s -> 22772.94s]  Why is this all in lowercase?
[22773.66s -> 22776.14s]  I'm just going to say Tom.
[22782.59s -> 22784.03s]  Thank you, Tom, for the five dollars.
[22788.69s -> 22792.29s]  I can't wait to, like, have the update where I can see actual capital letters.
[22792.93s -> 22796.00s]  But thank you for the five dollars.
[22796.00s -> 22797.20s]  And they say Pride 500.
[22797.20s -> 22797.52s]  Thank you.
[22798.32s -> 22800.08s]  Slade King, thanks for five dollars.
[22800.08s -> 22802.40s]  Also says Pride 100.
[22802.40s -> 22803.44s]  Pride 100.
[22803.44s -> 22805.39s]  Thank you, Slade King, for the five dollars.
[22805.95s -> 22807.54s]  Both of you back to back there.
[22807.54s -> 22808.34s]  Thank you.
[22808.34s -> 22810.14s]  Oh, the music's not on.
[22810.14s -> 22810.94s]  Fine.
[22810.94s -> 22817.31s]  And we also had a Heartache Cubed ten dollars.
[22817.87s -> 22820.74s]  Jerma, I was the guy with the healing deck.
[22820.74s -> 22821.70s]  GG.
[22821.70s -> 22825.62s]  Good game.
[22828.86s -> 22830.54s]  That deck was fucking pretty good.
[22830.54s -> 22831.42s]  You're a pretty good player.
[22832.22s -> 22833.84s]  Hey, nice job.
[22834.72s -> 22836.08s]  See you on the field.
[22836.08s -> 22842.45s]  But Heartache Cube, thanks for the ten dollars.
[22842.45s -> 22845.01s]  Jerma, it's my birthday in two days.
[22845.01s -> 22846.21s]  Please be my dad.
[22847.39s -> 22850.99s]  I can wish you a happy birthday, but I cannot be your father.
[22854.45s -> 22855.89s]  Thank you for the ten dollars.
[22855.89s -> 22859.87s]  And happy birthday in exactly two days from now.
[22862.46s -> 22862.94s]  Please.
[22864.19s -> 22865.55s]  All right, dad for a minute.
[22865.55s -> 22866.11s]  Here you go.
[22866.11s -> 22867.55s]  You got ten seconds of dead.
[22870.11s -> 22873.55s]  Son, nice work.
[22874.42s -> 22876.67s]  You played good out there.
[22876.67s -> 22878.43s]  See you on the field.
[22878.43s -> 22883.17s]  And then a little, like, just a little, like, I put my fist down,
[22883.17s -> 22884.37s]  and I give you, like, we bumped.
[22884.37s -> 22886.78s]  And it's just, there you go, son.
[22886.78s -> 22892.82s]  But I got a motherfucking one.
[22892.82s -> 22894.42s]  See how tall that grass has gotten?
[22896.94s -> 22898.46s]  And I got a call from your teacher.
[22898.94s -> 22901.71s]  You fell asleep in class, and then when you woke up,
[22901.71s -> 22903.31s]  you made a fart noise with your mouth.
[22903.87s -> 22904.83s]  Go to your room.
[22908.75s -> 22910.43s]  I mean, with my Johnny Walker blue.
[22911.15s -> 22915.71s]  How did I raise such a vicious son?
[22916.90s -> 22933.63s]  How did I raise such a vicious son?
[22933.63s -> 22935.31s]  Go back to the wall, dad.
[22937.10s -> 22938.62s]  No, I'm not going back in there.
[22938.62s -> 22939.58s]  It smells in there.
[22940.14s -> 22946.30s]  Hey, but hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[22946.30s -> 22947.98s]  And you look over your shoulder.
[22947.98s -> 22950.13s]  And I give you a wink, and I go,
[22950.13s -> 22952.74s]  you're my one and only.
[22952.74s -> 22965.89s]  And then we both nod.
[22965.89s -> 22967.41s]  Let's go get hot dogs tomorrow.
[22972.86s -> 22974.94s]  I think I just, yeah, somebody just said,
[22974.94s -> 22975.98s]  is that a coming-of-age movie?
[22975.98s -> 22977.58s]  I think that was, like, a movie.
[22979.71s -> 22982.75s]  I think that's every movie that has, like, a dad in it.
[22987.66s -> 22988.94s]  That was a long 10 seconds.
[22988.94s -> 22990.14s]  Yes, it was.
[22990.14s -> 22991.58s]  Okay, but happy birthday.
[22992.14s -> 22996.43s]  It was a pleasure being your dad for 10 seconds,
[22996.99s -> 22998.91s]  which was actually like four minutes.
[22998.91s -> 23003.73s]  But no, seriously, thank you so much for 10 bucks.
[23003.73s -> 23005.41s]  Freudian weapon, thanks for five dollars.
[23005.41s -> 23006.93s]  Maybe it's because I think you're insanely cool,
[23006.93s -> 23009.01s]  but I always have the uncanny need to play games
[23009.01s -> 23010.37s]  that you streamed.
[23010.37s -> 23012.77s]  I played Hearthstone once five years ago.
[23013.57s -> 23014.85s]  Didn't care for it then,
[23014.85s -> 23017.89s]  yet now I found my cursor gliding toward the download button.
[23018.45s -> 23018.95s]  Uh-oh.
[23019.49s -> 23020.69s]  But seriously, keep doing your thing.
[23020.69s -> 23021.97s]  Have a good night, Jermaheart.
[23023.55s -> 23024.19s]  Yeah, I don't know.
[23024.19s -> 23026.03s]  I just got, like, bit by the bug for some reason.
[23028.82s -> 23030.82s]  A few old games that I used to play
[23032.10s -> 23033.70s]  more than, like, three, four, five years ago,
[23033.70s -> 23035.30s]  I've started to creep up into my brain again.
[23036.11s -> 23037.87s]  And I'm like, yeah, I remember that was fun.
[23038.51s -> 23041.38s]  Don't be surprised if you see some more of it
[23041.38s -> 23055.41s]  thinking about downloading Hearthstone again.
[23056.05s -> 23059.49s]  I really do like their, this solo stuff.
[23060.83s -> 23062.03s]  It's so replayable.
[23062.03s -> 23063.95s]  The other ones, the first, like, two or three years
[23063.95s -> 23065.31s]  of the game when they made those adventures,
[23065.87s -> 23066.43s]  they were cool.
[23067.23s -> 23068.96s]  But these new adventures,
[23068.96s -> 23070.56s]  you can just play them a million times.
[23073.41s -> 23077.89s]  You just ignored a wave of, uh, something in the chat.
[23077.89s -> 23078.53s]  I don't know what it was.
[23079.09s -> 23082.32s]  The fuck?
[23082.32s -> 23085.04s]  People saying, like, the fuck, like, what the fuck, two?
[23085.76s -> 23089.90s]  Like, times, like, plus two, minus two?
[23089.90s -> 23090.40s]  I don't know.
[23090.94s -> 23100.77s]  I don't know.
[23100.77s -> 23101.49s]  Whatever that is.
[23102.21s -> 23104.18s]  I think it seems like it might be fun.
[23107.07s -> 23108.67s]  But thank you, Freudian, for the five dollars.
[23109.95s -> 23112.27s]  I guess when you see somebody just doing anything,
[23112.91s -> 23116.35s]  you kind of remember the time that you also did it.
[23116.35s -> 23118.99s]  And then maybe you weren't even thinking about Hearthstone today.
[23118.99s -> 23120.51s]  And I just happened to put it in your brain.
[23121.23s -> 23123.44s]  And then you're like, yeah, why not?
[23123.44s -> 23124.40s]  Happens to me all the time.
[23126.08s -> 23127.92s]  Thank you, Trampston, for the five dollars.
[23127.92s -> 23128.64s]  Game sucks.
[23128.64s -> 23129.68s]  I'm going to bed.
[23129.68s -> 23130.32s]  Have a good night.
[23130.32s -> 23131.36s]  I hope you have a good rest.
[23133.10s -> 23134.70s]  Thank you for the five dollars.
[23134.70s -> 23137.87s]  Freudian Weapon, thanks for two dollars and 50 cents.
[23137.87s -> 23139.47s]  By the way, I can't wait for Cooking Simulator.
[23139.47s -> 23140.03s]  Neither can I.
[23140.03s -> 23141.23s]  I've been waiting a long time for it.
[23143.66s -> 23148.80s]  I am very, very excited for tomorrow.
[23148.80s -> 23150.64s]  Hey, Smelly Boy, thanks for the two fifty.
[23150.64s -> 23152.40s]  Imagine being a Hearthstone stream watcher,
[23152.40s -> 23154.48s]  clicking the most watched Hearthstone stream,
[23154.48s -> 23157.44s]  and seeing the TF2 Spie guy from four years ago
[23157.44s -> 23159.44s]  getting his ass kicked constantly.
[23163.49s -> 23165.17s]  Wait, hold on.
[23165.17s -> 23171.74s]  First of all, you make that sound like the TF2 Spie guy.
[23171.74s -> 23173.98s]  You know, I made more than one video.
[23173.98s -> 23182.56s]  Oh, hey, oh, that's the TF2 Spie guy.
[23182.56s -> 23184.32s]  I have like a thousand uploads.
[23193.02s -> 23194.86s]  You are the TF2 Spie guy.
[23195.90s -> 23197.26s]  No, that's not what I am.
[23199.70s -> 23200.98s]  I'm so many other things.
[23202.77s -> 23203.57s]  I'm so many.
[23203.57s -> 23205.33s]  I'm so much more than that.
[23205.33s -> 23208.96s]  I'm going to go delete them.
[23208.96s -> 23210.32s]  It's time to delete those videos, yeah.
[23215.47s -> 23216.91s]  But yes, thank you for the two.
[23216.91s -> 23217.87s]  That was so funny.
[23221.65s -> 23223.17s]  I hope people save those screenshots
[23223.17s -> 23227.26s]  because that'll get a good laugh out of me
[23227.26s -> 23228.70s]  in the future when I forget about it.
[23230.61s -> 23232.21s]  Podcast Listener, thanks for ten dollars.
[23232.21s -> 23234.69s]  Back at it again with the bits, boys.
[23235.41s -> 23236.13s]  Germa checks.
[23236.85s -> 23238.19s]  There were a lot of them tonight.
[23238.99s -> 23239.87s]  I highly appreciate it.
[23239.87s -> 23245.76s]  You guys hand over huge amounts of money
[23245.76s -> 23248.48s]  and I fucking graciously accept.
[23249.04s -> 23249.36s]  Thank you.
[23252.96s -> 23256.83s]  Also, and then a couple hours ago
[23256.83s -> 23258.35s]  was a hundred dollars from Flutters.
[23258.35s -> 23258.99s]  We touched upon it,
[23258.99s -> 23260.75s]  but Flutters has been around for a long fucking time.
[23263.82s -> 23265.18s]  More than six years.
[23265.18s -> 23266.78s]  So thanks for being around.
[23268.61s -> 23271.25s]  Glad you still think it's interesting enough to watch
[23271.25s -> 23271.97s]  and be a part of.
[23276.21s -> 23278.85s]  Invader Z, thanks for the 250.
[23278.85s -> 23281.25s]  Hey, Germa, have you ever played Magic the Gathering?
[23281.25s -> 23283.39s]  I've been playing Commander a lot recently with friends.
[23283.39s -> 23284.83s]  I was wondering if you played it
[23284.83s -> 23286.67s]  since you're playing Hearthstone, which is similar.
[23287.31s -> 23288.83s]  I think I touched upon it a little bit,
[23288.83s -> 23290.67s]  but just in case you weren't here when I did.
[23292.75s -> 23294.67s]  I'm not really that into card games.
[23295.23s -> 23298.05s]  I don't really play a lot of card games.
[23298.05s -> 23304.54s]  Hearthstone is just very easy to just do random stuff
[23304.54s -> 23306.78s]  and have fun and open up minions
[23306.78s -> 23309.10s]  and have random acts.
[23309.10s -> 23314.10s]  And I don't know if I would be able to get into Magic.
[23323.06s -> 23324.74s]  Lives in Vegas, doesn't like cards.
[23324.74s -> 23326.10s]  No, that's a different kind of card.
[23328.83s -> 23330.43s]  MTG is definitely more involved.
[23330.43s -> 23333.54s]  Yeah, and I mean, obviously Hearthstone stream,
[23333.54s -> 23335.30s]  us hanging out and me dicking around
[23335.30s -> 23337.70s]  and going three and three and like oh and three
[23337.70s -> 23339.70s]  and like losing on heroic and just hanging out.
[23340.62s -> 23341.18s]  That's fine.
[23341.18s -> 23342.22s]  And it's fine.
[23342.22s -> 23346.32s]  And obviously, I don't think I'd want to do that
[23346.32s -> 23347.36s]  with like Magic the Gathering
[23347.36s -> 23350.24s]  because I'm not sure if there's any opportunities to do that.
[23351.86s -> 23354.10s]  Can you just like open up a game of Magic the Gathering
[23354.10s -> 23356.18s]  and just like not know every card
[23356.18s -> 23358.88s]  and try and get destroyed?
[23358.88s -> 23364.37s]  Would that be as interesting as Hearthstone?
[23364.37s -> 23373.33s]  Because I don't know anything about MTG, zero.
[23373.33s -> 23375.49s]  MTG might give you a heart attack,
[23375.49s -> 23377.89s]  but probably not.
[23377.89s -> 23382.72s]  You need to be really good at to have much fun with.
[23383.60s -> 23386.08s]  Yeah, and Hearthstone is right at that kind of layer
[23386.08s -> 23389.78s]  of casual and fun,
[23389.78s -> 23392.98s]  but still has like a good skill ceiling in it
[23392.98s -> 23394.58s]  in various ways.
[23394.58s -> 23396.42s]  There's still a meta in the game.
[23396.42s -> 23397.86s]  There's lots of things you need to know,
[23397.86s -> 23398.90s]  but not like Magic.
[23401.01s -> 23403.17s]  It's got a Magic has a lot more going on
[23403.17s -> 23406.53s]  that I wouldn't even be able to comprehend for a second,
[23406.53s -> 23411.49s]  but probably not.
[23411.49s -> 23414.37s]  And I still got destroyed in Hearthstone.
[23414.37s -> 23415.09s]  Yeah, that's what I mean.
[23415.09s -> 23416.69s]  That's kind of kind of what I'm saying.
[23421.30s -> 23422.42s]  Tingy, thanks for the 250.
[23422.42s -> 23423.06s]  I'm sorry, Dad.
[23423.06s -> 23423.54s]  We love you.
[23423.54s -> 23424.74s]  Jerma Pluto.
[23424.74s -> 23425.86s]  I'll be sorry, son.
[23426.50s -> 23427.81s]  You're a good boy.
[23428.37s -> 23432.02s]  You're just such a smart young lad.
[23436.61s -> 23437.01s]  Thank you.
[23440.40s -> 23442.08s]  M Weldo, thanks for the three dollars.
[23442.08s -> 23444.48s]  Think we all know what happened on that phone call yesterday.
[23444.48s -> 23445.60s]  Keep up the funny bits.
[23446.40s -> 23448.83s]  What happened on the phone call yesterday.
[23449.39s -> 23451.84s]  All right.
[23451.84s -> 23453.20s]  We'll put my agent on the line then.
[23453.20s -> 23453.68s]  I don't know why.
[23453.68s -> 23455.68s]  Is this like, is this Dr. Disrespect?
[23455.68s -> 23456.40s]  Why do I have to go?
[23457.28s -> 23459.44s]  Yeah, I don't know why, ladies and gentlemen.
[23459.44s -> 23461.28s]  I don't know why I have to go through his secretary
[23461.28s -> 23462.16s]  every single time.
[23462.88s -> 23472.37s]  Hello?
[23472.37s -> 23473.81s]  Hey, yeah.
[23473.81s -> 23476.13s]  So, hey, I got some inside knowledge.
[23476.13s -> 23479.09s]  Shroud's trying to tease me about potential revenue share,
[23479.81s -> 23481.41s]  some sort of battle royale experience.
[23481.41s -> 23483.01s]  You got any inside info?
[23483.97s -> 23485.50s]  No, I'm at a movie.
[23486.46s -> 23487.50s]  You still driving that Prius?
[23488.94s -> 23492.14s]  I just like spit all over the screen.
[23494.59s -> 23494.83s]  All right.
[23494.83s -> 23495.31s]  This isn't new.
[23495.31s -> 23496.27s]  Hold on.
[23496.27s -> 23499.98s]  You still driving that Prius?
[23500.54s -> 23503.01s]  It's like.
[23503.01s -> 23506.69s]  What was that?
[23506.69s -> 23507.57s]  Oh, no, I'll call you back.
[23515.01s -> 23516.05s]  I'm going to put it on the screen.
[23520.69s -> 23521.65s]  That's fucking funny.
[23528.80s -> 23529.92s]  No, I'm at a movie.
[23533.25s -> 23533.89s]  I'm going, I'm going.
[23533.89s -> 23534.61s]  I'm getting it on screen.
[23534.61s -> 23535.33s]  I'm getting it on screen.
[23535.33s -> 23535.89s]  Look.
[23535.89s -> 23536.45s]  All right.
[23536.45s -> 23537.81s]  We'll put my agent on the line then.
[23537.81s -> 23538.45s]  I don't know why.
[23538.45s -> 23539.25s]  Like, why do I have to go?
[23540.13s -> 23540.37s]  Yeah.
[23541.09s -> 23542.29s]  I don't know why, ladies and gentlemen.
[23542.29s -> 23544.13s]  I don't know why I have to go through his secretary
[23544.13s -> 23545.01s]  every single time.
[23553.78s -> 23555.20s]  Hello?
[23555.20s -> 23556.64s]  Hey, yeah.
[23556.64s -> 23559.04s]  So, hey, I got some inside knowledge.
[23559.04s -> 23562.00s]  Shroud's trying to tease me about potential revenue share,
[23562.72s -> 23564.32s]  some sort of battle royale experience.
[23564.32s -> 23565.76s]  You got any inside info?
[23565.76s -> 23566.40s]  Why would I?
[23567.68s -> 23569.38s]  No, I'm at a movie.
[23569.38s -> 23570.34s]  You still driving that Prius?
[23572.34s -> 23572.98s]  Yeah, that's like.
[23576.51s -> 23577.15s]  What was that?
[23577.15s -> 23578.03s]  Oh, no, I'll call you back.
[23585.86s -> 23587.86s]  Oh, a Team Fortress Classic with Star.
[23587.86s -> 23588.66s]  Fucking hell, yeah.
[23590.58s -> 23592.74s]  Oh, you got any inside intel on that?
[23592.74s -> 23594.10s]  And am I the secretary?
[23594.66s -> 23597.38s]  I got to go through his secretary and it's me.
[23604.51s -> 23606.51s]  Here's a link for those of you that want it.
[23606.51s -> 23607.76s]  That was funny.
[23608.32s -> 23613.87s]  That was M Weldo.
[23613.87s -> 23614.67s]  Thanks for the three bucks.
[23615.23s -> 23619.74s]  And thanks for the video.
[23621.79s -> 23625.31s]  And what do you say we get the credits on the screen?
[23625.31s -> 23626.83s]  This is going to be pretty wild.
[23627.55s -> 23630.98s]  You ready?
[23631.23s -> 23634.67s]  Here are all the subs from this stream.
[23635.31s -> 23644.32s]  As a rumor right there.
[23644.96s -> 23649.36s]  Jesus.
[23653.33s -> 23656.29s]  It had to have been at least a few, like more than a few hundred.
[23660.53s -> 23662.21s]  Opening Hearthstone card packs.
[23669.25s -> 23674.46s]  It's going so fast that it's lagging the plugin.
[23677.09s -> 23678.85s]  I'm losing, I'm dropping frames.
[23678.85s -> 23680.29s]  My frame rate is being dropped here.
[23682.72s -> 23683.52s]  But thank you all of you.
[23683.52s -> 23685.04s]  Thank you to all the community subs.
[23685.60s -> 23688.98s]  There was a shit loader in that first 30, 40 minutes.
[23689.54s -> 23691.60s]  You guys are too kind.
[23691.60s -> 23692.00s]  Thank you.
[23692.72s -> 23699.15s]  What do I say in the phone?
[23699.15s -> 23701.15s]  Somebody's screaming, put the phone down.
[23705.86s -> 23713.84s]  Well, it's me screaming it, but thank you to all of you.
[23714.77s -> 23716.21s]  We do have two more bits that came in.
[23716.21s -> 23718.05s]  We have Spooge for three dollars.
[23718.77s -> 23720.85s]  Hey, Germo, still nine months sub.
[23720.85s -> 23721.65s]  Where's the baby?
[23722.21s -> 23724.53s]  Also, what are some games you're looking forward to seeing at E3?
[23725.09s -> 23728.61s]  I know you had a rough time with Mountain Blade, but was that 2019?
[23732.03s -> 23732.83s]  It was, wasn't it?
[23734.67s -> 23734.99s]  Okay.
[23735.55s -> 23737.55s]  Yeah, we have a candidate.
[23737.55s -> 23738.51s]  Yeah, we have a candidate.
[23744.42s -> 23746.51s]  Yeah, well.
[23746.51s -> 23751.17s]  But, uh, give multiplayer a chance because that's where it really shines
[23751.17s -> 23753.57s]  and keeps an eye out for its sequel.
[23753.57s -> 23756.29s]  Or keep an eye out for its sequel, Bannerlord, if it ever comes out.
[23760.50s -> 23762.26s]  I can't, this is still going this fast.
[23765.71s -> 23767.07s]  Yeah, this mod's for two.
[23767.79s -> 23773.52s]  I just got so soured on it because I just, it was, I don't know.
[23773.52s -> 23775.76s]  It was half of me trying to figure out what to do
[23775.76s -> 23780.58s]  and the other half of trying to, you know, having people telling me things
[23780.58s -> 23782.26s]  and what to do and where to go.
[23783.06s -> 23784.82s]  It's kind of a perfect storm of things.
[23785.70s -> 23793.20s]  There's a lot of systems in that game that you have to pay attention to.
[23793.92s -> 23797.44s]  Bannerlord 2040.
[23797.44s -> 23800.24s]  Yeah, something like that.
[23805.18s -> 23808.06s]  Allmu said, I have surgery coming up and they're going to put me under.
[23808.70s -> 23811.71s]  It is my first time, so I can get some support.
[23812.27s -> 23815.90s]  Yeah, hopefully it goes well.
[23816.54s -> 23818.32s]  Hopefully your surgery goes well.
[23820.18s -> 23824.59s]  Anesthesia is a lot scarier the way that it seems rather than the way that it is.
[23825.15s -> 23829.33s]  So don't worry about that.
[23829.97s -> 23835.86s]  When I was put under, it was really comfortable.
[23838.05s -> 23839.57s]  I just kind of fell right asleep.
[23839.57s -> 23841.97s]  You don't really even, you don't really even know.
[23845.18s -> 23847.42s]  You're just lying there wherever you are
[23848.22s -> 23851.10s]  and somebody's like, okay, hey, you comfortable?
[23851.10s -> 23851.50s]  You good?
[23851.50s -> 23852.46s]  And it's like, yeah, I'm all right.
[23852.46s -> 23852.86s]  I'm okay.
[23853.95s -> 23855.87s]  And they, you know, slowly give it to you
[23856.59s -> 23863.39s]  and you, it just kind of, not in like a weird, scary way or anything,
[23863.39s -> 23867.02s]  but you just kind of, almost like you just kind of wake up.
[23868.46s -> 23871.97s]  You just wake up.
[23871.97s -> 23875.25s]  It's strange because you'll feel, you'll have the,
[23875.25s -> 23880.58s]  if you have an anesthesia in an IV, you just start to drift a second
[23880.58s -> 23890.58s]  and one, two, you're awake in the recovery room.
[23890.58s -> 23892.66s]  So that's kind of the way that it's happened to me
[23892.66s -> 23894.90s]  the last one or two times that I've had it.
[23894.90s -> 23898.46s]  You'll get some food if you can eat,
[23898.46s -> 23899.74s]  depending on what you have in for surgery.
[23902.80s -> 23905.98s]  But it's a lot, and they all know this,
[23906.62s -> 23908.83s]  these people are pros, right?
[23910.29s -> 23911.57s]  They know that people are nervous.
[23911.57s -> 23913.81s]  They know that, you know, it's kind of stressful.
[23914.45s -> 23915.73s]  You've got like five people.
[23916.29s -> 23918.69s]  When I had my colonoscopy this past week,
[23918.69s -> 23921.01s]  it was, you know, there's like four or five people
[23921.01s -> 23922.61s]  in the room all have masks on.
[23922.61s -> 23925.44s]  Like, okay, like, come over here.
[23925.44s -> 23927.44s]  And it's just like, oh, okay, all right, all right.
[23927.44s -> 23929.10s]  How are we doing?
[23929.10s -> 23932.43s]  But they're all, they want to take really good care of you.
[23932.43s -> 23937.89s]  They care about it.
[23937.89s -> 23941.95s]  Then most surgeons, most doctors and most anesthesiologists,
[23941.95s -> 23942.99s]  they've been doing it for a long time.
[23943.55s -> 23952.27s]  They know exactly what to do.
[23952.27s -> 23953.55s]  So I wouldn't worry about it at all.
[23955.63s -> 23956.43s]  You're going to get up
[23956.43s -> 23964.18s]  and you're not even going to realize it happened.
[23964.18s -> 23965.06s]  But I wish you luck.
[23968.10s -> 23973.71s]  All the love and support to you for real.
[23973.71s -> 23974.67s]  And let us know how it goes.
[23978.03s -> 23980.67s]  And finally, we have potato trapdoor
[23980.67s -> 23982.03s]  for $5 come in right now.
[23983.25s -> 23984.77s]  Six years of watching German on YouTube
[23984.77s -> 23986.21s]  and I finally watch a stream.
[23986.21s -> 23986.93s]  Glad to be here.
[23986.93s -> 23987.73s]  Welcome.
[23987.73s -> 23989.31s]  Hope you had fun.
[23989.31s -> 23990.27s]  Hope you enjoyed the stream.
[23990.27s -> 23992.67s]  And thanks for being around for six years.
[23994.51s -> 23995.39s]  Time flies.
[23997.31s -> 24000.22s]  Flies, flies, flies.
[24000.22s -> 24005.97s]  I will see you all tomorrow.
[24005.97s -> 24006.85s]  Same time.
[24006.85s -> 24010.21s]  Well, we started a little on the earlier side today.
[24013.20s -> 24015.20s]  Yeah, between three and four, same normal time.
[24016.26s -> 24017.22s]  Cooking simulator.
[24017.78s -> 24021.76s]  It's going to get rowdy in here tomorrow.
[24022.40s -> 24023.66s]  I can tell you that.
[24023.66s -> 24025.74s]  I'll do some stream legends for those of you that want it.
[24026.38s -> 24029.60s]  See you tomorrow.
[24029.60s -> 24031.66s]  Get some sleep.
[24031.66s -> 24034.75s]  Have a great rest of the night.
[24034.75s -> 24036.75s]  Goodbye, everybody.
[24038.14s -> 24038.54s]  Take care.
[24039.70s -> 24048.35s]  Ta-ta.
