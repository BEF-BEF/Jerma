[0.31s -> 23.90s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with, hold on a second. Oh yeah. Oh, that could have been really bad.
[23.90s -> 34.14s]  Welcome to Facecam Fortress 2. My name is Jerma. This is Saturday's edition. Hope you're having a fantastic Saturday playing as the soldier right now. Why do I have this loadout?
[34.14s -> 44.66s]  It works. What, what the, what just happened? That guy just turned into a spy. Did you guys see that? So he was disguised as a demo man.
[44.66s -> 60.46s]  Well, that's one way to die. Playing, why do I have this loadout? Playing as the soldier I said previously. Oh, the server you were playing on has lost connection to the item server. As a result, your loadout will now be available for this server.
[60.46s -> 79.72s]  Okay. We'll go with straight up default. I'm cool with that. Let me fill the rest of this up before I get it all over myself. So we are getting absolutely rolled right now. Get him off the cart, fellas.
[79.72s -> 105.12s]  I'm good at rocket jumping. Look. Oh, that was a crit. He doesn't know I'm in here. Come on. Oh, get rid of all of them. I got the shotgun. I got the shotgun. I'm good to go. Up from above. Here we go, ladies and gentlemen. Oh, that's a double kill.
[106.12s -> 129.18s]  Anybody else? Another sniper. Oh, come here. I've got to be careful here. I don't want to get myself killed. Ooh, spy soldier. What? Oh my God. Oh, I also want to tell you guys what I did.
[129.18s -> 148.18s]  I got a lot of comments on that video I did yesterday, the crazy 50,000 milestone, and people were saying, oh, I wasted a ton of food, which I did. I do say that I did waste a bunch of that ice cream, but to make up for it, I donated $50 to my local food bank.
[148.18s -> 156.36s]  So I think that might help with the wasteful food that I did in the previous day.
[156.36s -> 167.36s]  So I just want to let you guys know that I did that because a lot of people were concerned. They were like, oh, man, you wasted so much food. There's so many people that would have probably eaten that. And I do. I do agree with you. So I donated some money to my food bank.
[167.36s -> 186.49s]  So somebody could have an ice cream party, but we are going to lose right now. No, no, no. Come on. Come on. Don't kill me. Please don't kill me.
[186.49s -> 205.02s]  Got to go. Got to go. Got to go. Got to go. Come here. Don't die. It's all about the medic. Now we just have to defend this for nine and a half minutes. Good thing that's going to happen. It could. It could.
[205.02s -> 236.16s]  I think I'm overreacting here. We can do this. Come here, you son of a. He's stuck on the door. Run away. Oh, two seconds. One seconds. Come on. Oh, it's another roll. It's another. I'm staying back here for a little bit. I need to get some over here.
[236.16s -> 261.66s]  Oh, my God. That exploded. Oh, just go. Come here, heavy. Come here. That's what you got to do in these situations. You just got to be a psycho. No. Come here. Get over here. Come here. Good. Yeah. Oh, it worked. It worked.
[261.66s -> 289.04s]  They didn't get it. Oh, there's a heavy now. Get him off, Pyro. Come on, Pyro. Come on, Pyro. What are you? What are you guys AFK for? Hey, we still got it. We still got it. Just get down here. You are definitely a spy. Like, I guarantee it. Somebody come down here with me.
[289.04s -> 308.78s]  Drop down. Drop down on the cart, man. Overheels. Overheels. Overheel. Overheel. Overheel. I don't want to get backstabbed. Oh, I didn't get back. I got frontstabbed. It's over. It's over.
[308.78s -> 337.38s]  That same Pyro, man, is a legend. He keeps stopping them. Oh, well. I tried to go in there with the Chaos Medic. You can always try to get. We'll do one more. I got a feeling this one is going to be the real wow factor. I think I got the loadout back. Oh, yeah.
[337.38s -> 374.51s]  Kritzkrieg it is. Hey, why did you do that? Setup time? Well, that's not how you come back from setup time. I accidentally stopped recording. It's okay, though. It's okay. We didn't miss much. You just missed them capping the first point in like two seconds. Oh, my God. It's so terrifying. Come here. Come here. No, that's everyone's a spy. Everybody's a spy. Medic on Medic action. Oh, no. Oh, we are just getting absolutely crushed.
[375.51s -> 415.54s]  There's got to be something we can do here. Nope. That is a spy for sure. You are definitely a spy. No, stay alive. Don't get burned. Oh, there's nothing I can do here. Same Pyro again. You know what? Going heavy. Rage heavy. Let's go. Rage heavy. With all the rage and all the strength I have as a heavy, I'm going to just hold the button down in somebody's face. Rage heavy. Oh, yeah. Enemies have received additional time, huh?
[416.54s -> 457.14s]  We'll see what happens when they come around this corner and I rage heavy their ass. Like you. Get raged on. Oh, what's that? Rage heavy. Oh, hey, what's going on, everybody? What's going on, everybody? Oh, my God. I don't have the sandwich. Oh, crap. Don't have the sandwich. Don't have the sandwich. Somebody's going to come from right here and kill me. Oh, that's the guy that's dominating me. No, no. I was going to get my revenge. Oh, I got it anyway.
[457.14s -> 511.75s]  I got my revenge anyways. We are getting so crushed right now. This is so bad. Even the Dr. Pepper can't give me the strength. What a world we live in. I think that's a spy. No, it's not. Come here, you. Come here, you. Where is he? Oh, my God. He's right there. Damn it. I need health. I don't want to make myself known yet. Yikes. I need like a big health kit. There we go. There's a medic. There's a medic. Medic, heal me.
[511.75s -> 563.03s]  I just heard him. Where is he? Dead. Kill the other one. Get rid of the other medic. Get rid of him. Yes. All right. Anybody? Anybody? Any spies? Any spies? You could be a spy. You could be. You're not, though. I'm good. Don't let him get to the top. Don't let him get to the top. Give me the health. Oh, I got to get up here. Got to get up here. Come on, medic. Let's do it. No. Oh, they're going to win. That's going to be three losses in a row. Crap. It's all right. Set it to granary? Sure.
[563.03s -> 599.17s]  I don't. We'll go to granary. At least I'll get this one guy. Yay. My thing leveled up. He's taunting. He's taunting. They're taunting. Get on there. Get on it. Blow up. What? Oh, I didn't get to see everybody blow up. That was what I wanted to stand there and watch for. Oh, well. Well, that's going to wrap up this Facecam Fortress 2, Saturday's edition, guys. Thank you so much for watching. I really do appreciate it. And of course, take care, everybody.
