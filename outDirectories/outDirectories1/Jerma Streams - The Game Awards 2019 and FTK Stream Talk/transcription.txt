[0.70s -> 20.94s]  I was here. For the game awards? I was here. Hi everybody. Welcome to the game awards pre-show.
[23.54s -> 31.11s]  And the game awards pre-show, I thought the game awards started at 5 30. No, it actually starts at
[31.11s -> 43.54s]  six. So I mean, I guess we could see what's gonna happen before the show starts. But I think we'll
[43.54s -> 49.58s]  probably just talk about Minecraft for like a half an hour. Because I was gonna do that anyways.
[53.38s -> 58.58s]  Now people probably going, why would you talk about Minecraft for a half an hour? This is a
[58.58s -> 61.62s]  perfect opportunity to do it. But I want to make sure a lot of people are here to see it.
[65.11s -> 72.41s]  We have a lot of important things to discuss. Because the fuck the king stream is very, very,
[72.41s -> 81.98s]  very rapidly approaching. We're going to go over it. We'll talk about it. We'll see it. Well,
[81.98s -> 86.65s]  actually, what are they? What do they do? They start on time? That's a better question. Did
[86.65s -> 93.13s]  they start on time? No, it's a black screen. No, that's like an ad. What is this? What's this?
[93.13s -> 99.13s]  What's this an ad for? I can't even hear it. What is this? To the Twitch partner program.
[101.29s -> 108.79s]  We got partner boys. Twitch ad. Should I not be showing this? Who just gifted like a thousand subs?
[109.27s -> 114.95s]  Wow. Thank you so much for the 10,000 bits. Thank you so much. All right, we're gonna
[115.83s -> 123.99s]  let's go back to this. Wait, hold on. The whole purpose for that was to see what was going on
[124.71s -> 134.86s]  on their stream. Don't do it again. They're late. They're late. It's supposed to start at 5 30. It's
[134.86s -> 143.34s]  going to start at like 5 36. See? See? Even like a multi-million dollar production is six to seven
[143.34s -> 159.80s]  minutes late. So come on. Their broadcast probably costs like five million bucks. Right now,
[159.80s -> 165.32s]  Jeff Keely is about to write in his chat. Oh, gosh. There's internet problems here, guys.
[166.52s -> 176.34s]  Cox is fucking up. I gotta let Otto up. Hold on. I'll be back. I forgot to go to the bathroom today,
[176.34s -> 182.78s]  guys. Give me like another 10 minutes. Have I eaten food today? No, I haven't. I ate a
[182.78s -> 197.29s]  microwave burrito three days ago. I have to eat. Facecam, please. Everybody wants the facecam
[197.29s -> 211.53s]  turned on for some reason. We got three minutes to the game awards. Oh, we gotta talk about
[211.53s -> 217.75s]  Minecraft. Right. All right. Minecraft. I gotta get something on the screen. Forget about the game.
[217.75s -> 224.86s]  The pre-show. It's like the it's going to the movies. Okay. If you've been to the movies more
[224.86s -> 233.03s]  than once or twice in a month, you've seen all the previews. So, but the third movie you go to
[233.03s -> 235.99s]  in the month of December is going to be the same previews that you saw two weeks ago. You know,
[235.99s -> 243.00s]  who cares? You've already seen it. You've already seen the trailer for Gemini Man 15 times. You
[243.00s -> 251.14s]  don't need to see it again. So we're going to talk about Minecraft. Yes, I do. No, you don't.
[257.00s -> 260.78s]  I got to turn off actually. No, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. This is important.
[261.70s -> 267.34s]  This is really actually important to me. What time is it? I'm sitting here for two minutes.
[267.34s -> 271.78s]  I want to see if they start in two minutes. I hope the counter goes up. I hope the counter
[271.78s -> 278.86s]  goes up like another three minutes. I'm going to sit here for two minutes. We're not going to
[278.86s -> 286.22s]  watch like a second of the pre-show just to make sure we're clear on this. Why is everybody calling
[286.22s -> 292.86s]  me a villain? Because I decided that today I was going to relax today. But that makes me a villain.
[298.74s -> 307.14s]  Oh, you want to just like take a load off and relax. Don't comb your hair back. It's it sets
[307.14s -> 316.87s]  there. I like the way that it sets. It's this. This is what I do on my days off. Listen to this
[316.87s -> 324.39s]  epic music. People are giving subs and shit. Splarg gave five community subs. And, and,
[325.35s -> 329.91s]  and something else happened too. What else happened? Right now something happened.
[329.91s -> 332.63s]  I don't have notifications on because this is a video game award. So I'm just going to give
[332.63s -> 336.87s]  a hundred dollars. Uh, Freddie Dredd, 10,000 bits. Thank you, Freddie Dredd.
[337.67s -> 346.46s]  A hundred fucking, uh, 10,000 bits. Can I be in that ad? 10,000 bits.
[347.66s -> 352.41s]  What? Uh, no, but seriously, that's a lot of fucking money. Thank you, Freddie.
[357.24s -> 360.84s]  40 seconds. Thanks for the hundred dollars. We haven't even gotten started yet. There's
[360.84s -> 364.52s]  nothing on the screen yet. All right. Here are my predictions for game of the year.
[365.59s -> 369.75s]  Game of the year. I got to say it now before we, before everybody else comes on the camera,
[369.75s -> 374.79s]  that's not me and tells you their predictions. Game of the year. Resident Evil 2. If Resident
[374.79s -> 380.86s]  Evil 2 does not win game of the year this year, games, gaming is dead. Video games are dead.
[381.58s -> 395.21s]  It's over. If Resident Evil 2 does not win. That's a fact. Okay. Let's see. It's five,
[395.21s -> 419.77s]  it's five 36 right now. Here it comes. Oh, it's not ready. What's going on?
[419.77s -> 425.37s]  Host for the game awards 2019 pre-show. The game awards will begin at the top of the hour
[425.37s -> 432.09s]  featuring musical performances by Green Day. Green Day's here? And brand new looks at ghosts
[432.09s -> 437.61s]  of Tsushima and Gears tactics. But while the Microsoft feature fills in behind me and the
[437.61s -> 443.29s]  world gets their popcorn ready, we've got 30 minutes of awards, special guests, and world
[443.29s -> 450.17s]  premieres of our own right here in the pre-show, including a brand new trailer for Final Fantasy
[450.17s -> 458.70s]  VII Remake. Haven't they shown a new trailer for this game like the last five years? By handing
[458.70s -> 464.22s]  out our first trophy of the night. And this is a special one. The game awards have a new category
[464.22s -> 468.78s]  this year to honor the teams that honor their community. The best community support award goes
[468.78s -> 474.70s]  to a game that listens, reacts, and responds to its players with respect and transparency.
[474.70s -> 485.22s]  The nominees for best community support are Apex Legends. Best community? Oh, okay. This is the
[485.22s -> 495.27s]  company that patches their game the most. But what if the game is broken and fucked up from the
[495.27s -> 500.95s]  beginning? And the winner is? Does that make you, I guess, what patches? It's gonna be Fortnite
[500.95s -> 512.12s]  season two. Destiny 2. They were right, they were right there. Congratulations. Thank you very much.
[512.12s -> 517.40s]  This is a, this is really an honor. I gotta acknowledge the people at Bungie who've worked
[517.40s -> 521.56s]  so hard to, you know, support our community, starting with our community team, who are on
[521.56s -> 527.48s]  the front lines every day interacting with our fans, the core development team, our operations folks,
[527.48s -> 532.44s]  like, everyone up and down just cares so much about this game, and I just, I gotta acknowledge
[532.44s -> 535.64s]  all their hard work. I don't play it, no. The only thing I'd add is everyone here creates
[535.64s -> 539.24s]  entertainment, and what use is creating entertainment if you don't have awesome fans, so
[539.32s -> 544.84s]  special thanks to our fans. That's amazing. Well, congratulations again. Thank you so much. Thank
[544.84s -> 551.40s]  you. What, was Reggie playing Destiny 2? I didn't know it won. Huge congratulations to Destiny 2
[551.40s -> 556.36s]  for winning our first ever best community support award. I'm sure it's no coincidence they are also
[556.36s -> 562.52s]  up for the best ongoing game later tonight. Now, the game awards is a show about celebrating all
[562.52s -> 566.28s]  of gaming. I haven't paid any attention so far. Throughout the night, you'll see unexpected
[566.28s -> 571.80s]  additions to games you love, check-ins on games you're anticipating, and reveals you never saw
[571.80s -> 584.71s]  coming. Here's the first of many world premieres. First preview. I can sense a great cosmic
[584.71s -> 590.31s]  disturbance. We must be prepared for the worst. Time to change history for the better.
[593.26s -> 602.44s]  Oh my god, that was so fucking loud, and it was all my fault. I'm so sorry guys, that was all my
[602.44s -> 610.36s]  fault. I turned it up by turning something up over there. That was seriously like somebody just
[610.36s -> 617.72s]  punched you in the face. Like, I just punched you in the face. Oh my god, I'm so sorry.
[620.10s -> 631.75s]  Our first world premiere. Didn't this game already come out? I thought this game already came out.
[631.91s -> 641.13s]  I will blend things. Rise of the feast. Oh, there's no Marvel Ultimate Alliance. Right,
[641.13s -> 645.54s]  right, right, right, okay. Oh, I gotta turn the camera off when that happens.
[646.26s -> 652.02s]  In 2018, the game awards teamed up with Facebook Gaming to honor global gaming citizens. People
[652.02s -> 657.38s]  from all areas of gaming who use the power of games to create a positive influence. Tonight,
[657.38s -> 662.90s]  I'm joined by one of the global gaming citizens we met last year who has a new project to show us.
[662.90s -> 669.78s]  Please welcome Luol Mayen. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Yeah. So Luol, what have you
[669.78s -> 675.14s]  been working on? Yeah, for sure. You know, as someone from Africa and also as a refugee,
[675.14s -> 679.46s]  I want to thank everybody that has been supporting me to come up with a game today.
[679.46s -> 685.06s]  Facebook Gaming, Eisenbeck, and Luol Deng. I've been working on a game that actually put a player
[685.06s -> 690.58s]  in the shoes of a refugee. It's a game that actually talk about journey and helping people
[690.58s -> 695.22s]  to understand their empathy and this is something that video game can be able to do around the world.
[695.22s -> 699.94s]  We can be able to change the world and help people around the world and see what whatever
[699.94s -> 704.50s]  they're going through through playing video game. So it's a game really that put a player in the
[704.50s -> 710.18s]  shoes of refugees and bridging the reality world and what is actually happening on the ground.
[710.18s -> 714.26s]  So I'm really so excited about the project. Incredible. Well, let's take a look. Yeah,
[714.26s -> 717.86s]  sure. We got a trailer? Why would I turn the camera on for the trailer? Because games are
[717.86s -> 722.66s]  very powerful to create empathy and to help people understand a journey of a refugee.
[722.66s -> 727.86s]  Growing up in a refugee camp, my mother spent three years looking for $300 to buy a computer.
[728.90s -> 734.02s]  Then I taught myself how to create a video game. My mission in creating Salam is to let the world
[734.02s -> 739.30s]  know what it's like to be a refugee. When you buy medicine and food in the game, it goes to real
[739.30s -> 745.70s]  refugees, refugees like me. Together, we can take small steps to make a big difference.
[746.58s -> 754.09s]  What is Facebook Instant Games? It's so great to show you games like Salam. We have such a unique
[754.09s -> 759.05s]  opportunity here at the Game Awards to shine our spotlight on games big and small. Look forward
[759.05s -> 764.57s]  to seeing some more interesting Indies later tonight. This next Game Awards category also
[764.57s -> 770.01s]  demonstrates this kind of diversity in gaming. The nominees represent completely different budgets,
[770.01s -> 776.01s]  nationalities, and genres, but they all share one thing, excellent music. Here are the nominees
[776.01s -> 782.09s]  for best score in music. Cadence of Hyrule. They're really running. They're really sprinting.
[782.97s -> 787.45s]  Death Stranding. It's going to be Kingdom Hearts 3 because of like, it's going to be Kingdom Hearts 3.
[787.45s -> 792.17s]  Devil May Cry 5. It's going to be Kingdom Hearts 3. Kingdom Hearts 3.
[793.45s -> 796.89s]  Right. Listen to that. Listen to me. And Sayonara Wild Hearts.
[798.01s -> 806.38s]  And the winner is... This is unfair though. See, even she's like, yeah. Death Stranding.
[806.38s -> 816.92s]  Oh shit. I was going to say it's like Disney songs. You can't compete with Let It Go.
[816.92s -> 820.04s]  I don't know what to do. I like your colors. Oh my gosh. Thank you so much. I like your colors
[820.04s -> 824.28s]  as well. How are you feeling? I've been nervous this whole week and I can't believe this is
[824.28s -> 830.12s]  happening right now. I just want to say big thanks and shout out and also a congratulations
[830.12s -> 835.32s]  to Low Roar Churches and Southern Poets for helping us. I'm talking about Minecraft. All right.
[837.08s -> 840.60s]  Why am I talking about Minecraft? I'm just super happy to be here and I'm super thankful
[841.16s -> 845.72s]  for all the fans who inspired us to do something super weird and I hope we can
[845.72s -> 850.30s]  keep on doing weird shit going forward. All right. We'll do it after.
[850.30s -> 854.70s]  I think we all hope that. We only got like 16 minutes. I needed like 30 to talk about this.
[856.95s -> 861.83s]  For the past two E3s, there's been one game featured in the PC gaming show that continues
[861.83s -> 867.67s]  to fill our imagination with endless possibilities. I'm talking, of course, about Maneater,
[867.67s -> 872.39s]  the game where you are a killer shark that eats people. If you're hungry for more Maneater,
[872.39s -> 877.19s]  here's a new world premiere. What is Maneater? This is the first time I've ever heard anyone
[877.19s -> 885.54s]  talk about this. Hey, gamers. You know that thing that we've never spoken about? Here it is.
[887.86s -> 894.42s]  But only five humans are killed by sharks. It's time to even the score.
[894.98s -> 907.93s]  Isn't this game on Newgrounds right now? It's a Newgrounds game.
[926.28s -> 931.16s]  Can I evolve legs? I'll play it if I can get legs to walk around and I get in a car and drive
[931.16s -> 948.97s]  around. All right. Stephen Curry will be here tonight to award the best esports player of 2019,
[948.97s -> 954.25s]  but for now, I have the honor of acknowledging the winners for some esports categories.
[954.25s -> 967.00s]  For best esports coach, the nominees are Adrian, Kane, Koma, Soksha, and Zonic.
[967.64s -> 979.18s]  And the winner is Zonic. So do we only use handles now? The nominees are the 2019
[979.34s -> 999.48s]  League of Legends World Championships. I based this on which one of these I actually watched,
[999.48s -> 1004.76s]  and I didn't watch any of them. I think, no, no, no, I caught like maybe two hours of EVO.
[1016.10s -> 1018.18s]  How many, how many fans does this game have?
[1028.12s -> 1034.12s]  I wish they would show what they're like in brackets their name. And for best esports team,
[1034.12s -> 1043.06s]  the nominees are Astralis, G2 Esports. I'm so removed from this. I have, I don't know any of
[1043.06s -> 1048.26s]  these things. You know when like the older generation gets old enough and then they look
[1048.26s -> 1053.70s]  back and they go, I don't, I don't know what this is. I'm in that moment now. I mean, I think this
[1053.70s -> 1059.46s]  is cool as shit, but I don't know any of these things. I don't know any of these things. I think
[1059.46s -> 1065.22s]  it's cool shit though. He's a boomer.
[1065.46s -> 1069.38s]  Where the game awards are part of a special double feature with Jumanji the next level.
[1070.34s -> 1074.74s]  We're about to take a short break, but first here's a little message from a couple of the
[1074.74s -> 1081.38s]  stars of Jumanji the next level. Jumanji? What's up game awards? What's up PlayStation?
[1081.38s -> 1089.70s]  We checked out dreams. Oh boy. It was trippy. We're in a game. Yeah, no kidding. Especially
[1089.78s -> 1097.38s]  your face. That was sculpted in dreams by the way. You can be the judge when you see it for
[1097.38s -> 1102.26s]  yourself. Oh, that's crazy. We can't wait for you to see Jumanji the next level. That's actually
[1102.26s -> 1108.44s]  insane. I can't say this enough. We're in a video game. I'm not gonna watch this movie, but wait,
[1108.44s -> 1137.16s]  this is Jumanji single. What's coming up next? What's the next, what's the next preview? Now,
[1137.16s -> 1141.48s]  these are video games. That's, now this one was good. I actually really liked that one.
[1142.97s -> 1169.83s]  That one was, not so good. I'm sorry. He hated it. I didn't hate it. What's next? Tell me so much.
[1187.93s -> 1194.66s]  Back to the game awards pre-show. This summer, I had the pleasure of joining Jeff to co-host
[1194.66s -> 1200.26s]  Gamescom opening night live. And one of the games we revealed that night was Amplitude Studios
[1200.26s -> 1205.30s]  Humankind. Here to unveil a new gameplay feature and the first trailer with gameplay,
[1205.30s -> 1213.30s]  please welcome Jeff Spock. Hey Jeff. Hi, thanks Cindy. I'm very excited and kind of terrified
[1213.30s -> 1218.18s]  to be here. I'm here to answer a question we've been hearing constantly since we announced the
[1218.18s -> 1223.22s]  game this summer. And the question is, who am I playing? Am I playing a king, a queen, a historical
[1223.22s -> 1226.58s]  figure, leader of a civilization? He knows we're talking about Minecraft. Tonight we can announce
[1226.58s -> 1232.10s]  that you are going to play you. The idea is that you're going to create a highly customizable
[1232.10s -> 1237.54s]  avatar that will evolve visually as you play the game. So as you make gameplay decisions,
[1237.54s -> 1243.22s]  as you win achievements, as you select cultures and that sort of thing, you'll see that evolve
[1243.22s -> 1248.02s]  on the avatar itself, which means that at the end of the game you'll have sort of a record
[1248.02s -> 1254.98s]  and a trophy of how you changed humankind. We have tons of ideas of where the avatar system can go.
[1254.98s -> 1259.94s]  We're very excited about it. But if I talk about them, the programmers will literally disembowel me
[1259.94s -> 1268.26s]  when I get home. So in order to avoid that, we put together a trailer. So we have a game experience
[1268.26s -> 1273.78s]  and gameplay trailer to showcase the human avatar system. Beautiful. Why don't we take a look?
[1273.78s -> 1276.74s]  All right, here we go. I'm ready for this. This actually sounds like it could be good.
[1276.74s -> 1294.89s]  It all started way back. Back to basics. Ah, days. Gathering, hunting, and well,
[1294.89s -> 1302.41s]  back to gathering. We switched from a cold to a cool place to settle. And I found the perfect
[1302.41s -> 1307.77s]  spot for my people. At first it was just a few walls to keep the bears out and the pigs in.
[1307.77s -> 1313.93s]  But you know how it is. One district led to another and it kind of snowballed.
[1314.81s -> 1319.77s]  Now the problem was the neighbors thought the grass was greener on my side of the fence.
[1320.49s -> 1326.57s]  But we saw them disembowel me. All I had to do was give the order. It really hurt. Their first
[1326.57s -> 1334.73s]  mistake, bringing infantry to a cavalry fight. Next, losing the high ground. Final mistake,
[1334.73s -> 1344.33s]  not keeping up in the arms race. But eventually peace prevailed. They surrendered and I let them
[1344.33s -> 1352.07s]  live. It turns out we had a lot to learn from them. And together we became more than the sum of our
[1352.07s -> 1358.47s]  parts, a unique mix of cultures and beliefs. So yeah, I would say I left my mark on humankind
[1358.47s -> 1361.67s]  and I'm just getting started. Is this civilization?
[1362.87s -> 1368.18s]  That's just my story. Tell me, what will yours be?
[1370.42s -> 1376.14s]  Oh by the way, what the fuck's going on with the Apple Arcade? I bought Apple Arcade and it's like
[1376.14s -> 1380.70s]  a hundred games and we add, they haven't added anything. It's been like three and a half weeks
[1380.70s -> 1384.94s]  since they've added a new game to the Apple Arcade. What's going on there? I keep checking
[1384.94s -> 1389.42s]  it and it says nothing there. It's the same like 80 games. They honestly haven't even told me what
[1389.42s -> 1395.26s]  it is yet. So I am just as in the dark as all of you right now. And I got to say it's pretty
[1395.26s -> 1399.26s]  exciting. I really have no clue what to expect right now, but we're all in this together. So
[1399.26s -> 1406.14s]  let's all kick back and enjoy this one. Another world premiere. Oh, look at all these world,
[1406.14s -> 1422.01s]  go ahead and world premiere, world premiere, world premiere. I thought that was Eric Cartman. For one
[1422.01s -> 1436.20s]  second. I was like, that's Eric Cartman speaking. What? What the fuck? 20 years he's back and he's
[1436.20s -> 1448.46s]  here to take over the world. He's back to take over. Who? You? Damon. I love you. Do it. These
[1448.46s -> 1460.17s]  superheroes are popular and they're gonna jump on that. What are you? I'm a goddamn superhero.
[1468.82s -> 1471.22s]  Good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[1484.73s -> 1489.53s]  Okay. So I'm glad they're actually making that game and not like that weird top down VR fake
[1489.53s -> 1494.97s]  reality. Ghostbusters top down game. I don't even know why they did that.
[1506.01s -> 1514.49s]  If you're on TikTok, get off now. Get off now and secure your data. Change all your passwords.
[1528.65s -> 1531.45s]  Fortnite VR? Why is there Fortnite VR?
[1536.01s -> 1549.90s]  I talked a lot of shit about this game like last year. Let's see if I'm proven wrong.
[1578.98s -> 1593.77s]  You've seen this. They keep re-editing the same footage three years straight.
[1604.98s -> 1609.86s]  What if this never comes out? What if we keep getting re-edits of trailers for the next like
[1609.86s -> 1616.74s]  six years to keep Square Enix's stock up? This is an earnings call thing, guy.
[1617.54s -> 1636.41s]  This is an earnings call thing. This is never coming up. All right, it's coming up tomorrow.
[1646.01s -> 1647.45s]  Best fighting game? Mortal Kombat 11.
[1658.65s -> 1667.46s]  Samurai Showdown and Super Smash Brothers Ultimate. And we're gonna get the final DLC
[1667.46s -> 1670.34s]  character. The gentleman right here, they're gonna reveal the final DLC character. It's gonna be
[1670.34s -> 1685.50s]  Scorpion. Super Smash Brothers Ultimate. Congratulations. It's heavy. It is, isn't it?
[1685.50s -> 1690.38s]  They're just right there. Thank you Game Awards and thank you everyone out there very, very much.
[1690.38s -> 1695.42s]  You know, Super Smash Brothers Ultimate is really more than just a fighting game. It's an experience
[1695.42s -> 1701.66s]  that brings people together. It's also a showcase for some of the most famous characters, music,
[1702.46s -> 1708.38s]  game worlds, and video game history. And the fact that all of this comes together so seamlessly and
[1708.38s -> 1714.70s]  so beautifully is really a testament to the dedication, to the hard work, and to the skill
[1714.70s -> 1719.58s]  of Mr. Sakurai and the development team. This award is for them. Thank you very, very much.
[1719.58s -> 1727.80s]  I like them. I like them. I want to see the other, I want to see the camera pull out.
[1727.80s -> 1732.84s]  We are now just seconds away from the start of the big show. How excited is everybody?
[1733.64s -> 1740.60s]  There's just like a queue up to the stage. The Game Awards orchestra is prepared. Jeff Keely
[1740.60s -> 1746.84s]  is buttoning up his tux. They pull back. Everyone here in the live audience seems ready to go.
[1746.84s -> 1755.54s]  Fuck, this is a long line. Yeah, let's hear it. It's going to be such a special show. Green Day,
[1755.54s -> 1761.22s]  churches, and Grimes will all be performing. There are a bunch of world premieres that are
[1761.22s -> 1767.86s]  going to amaze everyone and I honestly have no idea who is going to win Game of the Year.
[1768.50s -> 1773.86s]  But that's a wrap on our pre-show. I'm Sydney Goodman. Have fun and enjoy the show.
[1774.82s -> 1779.54s]  The Game Awards starts right now. Yeah, that's it. I'm going to get up and leave the theater now.
[1780.10s -> 1783.06s]  I just bought my ticket to see the previews. That's all I care about. I'm just gone.
[1784.26s -> 1822.26s]  When the movie starts, I leave. Gemini Man is still in theaters? Why? Tell me something.
[1822.26s -> 1832.01s]  Why is it so hard for you to kill this man? Every move of mine before I made it.
[1832.49s -> 1853.48s]  What a cool trailer. What a good trailer. That's all you need. Wait, what is this?
[1854.20s -> 1882.12s]  Is it raining? Well, this isn't accurate. Let me make this accurate for you. All that equipment is
[1882.12s -> 1901.85s]  destroyed. I always feel fucking weird when I'm sitting. You know what I mean? Like, ready?
[1902.81s -> 1913.82s]  Like, it's cool to do this when you're in the audience, but you let me here just like...
[1913.82s -> 1920.52s]  Look, I'm a much bigger audience member. I take up more space than anybody here.
[1921.16s -> 1928.87s]  I'm just a huge fucking audience member. I'm doing what everybody else is doing.
[1929.35s -> 1941.50s]  The show is for me.
[1972.58s -> 2011.64s]  Pay attention. Pay attention to what? The tuba? Pay attention to the tuba.
[2012.52s -> 2025.03s]  Listen. You listen to music. You can listen to music.
[2025.91s -> 2039.45s]  Where's my reaction commentary? That's what I'm saying. When you go to a concert,
[2039.45s -> 2044.89s]  you're not sitting there going, awesome show. Very cool work. No, no, no. This is your
[2044.89s -> 2051.85s]  commentary. That's what you get. This is what commentary is at a show. You applaud. You say,
[2051.85s -> 2058.65s]  good. Cheer. Yeah, excellent work. During the performance, you're not going, cool.
[2059.85s -> 2066.97s]  I love this show. I'm a big fan of this show. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, you're doing good. You're
[2066.97s -> 2072.95s]  doing it. That'll get removed from the audience. How about that you're a heckler? What is this?
[2072.95s -> 2093.74s]  Death Stranding 2? Oh, by the way, there's like 10 years of Warcraft spoilers right there,
[2094.46s -> 2096.62s]  so don't tell me I'm spoiling a movie for you.
[2118.71s -> 2128.23s]  Jeff Keighley. Yeah, Jeff. Woo. Yeah. Woo. Yes. Go for it. That's what's acceptable commentary
[2128.23s -> 2138.12s]  right now. I'm Jeff Keighley. Go for it. Woo. Shut up. I can't believe this is the fifth
[2138.12s -> 2142.12s]  anniversary of the show, and it's so great to have all of you here. We've got so many amazing
[2142.12s -> 2149.32s]  special guests, Mr. Kojima, Reggie, Mr. Miyazaki. It's so exciting to have everyone here with us
[2149.32s -> 2154.20s]  tonight to celebrate games. First of all, let's give it up again for Churches and the Game Awards
[2154.20s -> 2160.20s]  Orca Show. What's not beautiful? Ninja's sitting right behind Reggie. You know, tonight, one of
[2160.20s -> 2163.64s]  the things that really amazes me about this show is how we connect the world around games.
[2163.64s -> 2169.08s]  Do you like at some point during this thing when you're getting up to go to the bathroom?
[2171.80s -> 2175.40s]  I'm having to get back to my seat. Reggie, I'm a huge fucking fan.
[2175.40s -> 2181.80s]  And then you sit back down. How do you come together all to celebrate video games? Now,
[2181.80s -> 2187.56s]  our show tonight, yes, we're going to have awards. Yes, we're going to have a lot of brand new game
[2187.56s -> 2194.74s]  announcements and surprises for you. So stay tuned for that. We know you like those. And we've also
[2194.74s -> 2205.35s]  got performances by Green Day and Grind. So stay tuned. It's been an outstanding year for games.
[2205.35s -> 2208.71s]  But to kick things off, let's get to our first award. And right now,
[2208.71s -> 2212.23s]  let's bring out our first presenter. He is a screenwriter and producer known for The Dark
[2212.23s -> 2220.49s]  Knight and also the co-creator of Westworld. Please welcome Jonathan Nolan. What? Why is
[2220.49s -> 2230.31s]  Jonathan Nolan here? Good evening. I'm here to present the award for Best Narrative.
[2231.19s -> 2235.67s]  We talk a lot about narrative in Westworld, where our guest characters choose their own paths with
[2235.67s -> 2240.63s]  branching storylines that change based on their actions. It's an idea that we invented all by
[2240.63s -> 2246.47s]  ourselves. You're welcome. By the way, I could write circles around everybody here. Just wait
[2246.47s -> 2252.71s]  till I make my game. I saw that year was my answer as often as not isn't a movie. It's not a show.
[2252.71s -> 2258.55s]  It's a game. Games like Fallout, Bioshock, Half Life, Red Dead Redemption,
[2260.79s -> 2264.71s]  all hugely influential on our work. And you can see the echoes of those games
[2264.71s -> 2270.87s]  in our show. Everett Rachel Wood's character, Dolores, has more than a little in common with
[2270.87s -> 2275.75s]  Elizabeth in Bioshock Infinite. James Marsden's character, Teddy, was, of course, based on
[2275.75s -> 2282.76s]  James Marsden's character in Sonic the Hedgehog. And of course, I'd be remiss if I failed to
[2282.76s -> 2287.00s]  mention the debt of honor that Ed Harris's character, the Man in Black, owes to Kuber.
[2287.88s -> 2293.24s]  So it's a true honor for me to be here tonight to recognize the amazing, thoughtful, and
[2293.24s -> 2297.40s]  groundbreaking work in narrative this year. Here are the nominees.
[2325.30s -> 2333.35s]  Everyone. And the winner is Disco Elysium.
[2334.39s -> 2342.92s]  Tonight, Disco Elysium always wins the Game Award for Best Role Playing Game.
[2344.04s -> 2349.37s]  Imagine if one of the tech directors actually just leaked every award nomination to everyone.
[2352.89s -> 2363.86s]  It's absolutely surreal to be here. And honestly, it makes me really speechless.
[2363.86s -> 2368.74s]  But I definitely want to thank everyone who believed that this game exists when we first
[2368.74s -> 2374.90s]  started talking about it, because a lot of people didn't. And I want to thank the industry
[2374.90s -> 2382.02s]  for welcoming us. It's been absolutely amazing. And of course, I want to thank our fans who
[2382.90s -> 2391.22s]  really proved that these kinds of narrative games have their place in this industry.
[2391.86s -> 2396.82s]  And yeah, thanks a lot. This game's good, right? Would I like this game?
[2397.78s -> 2402.18s]  Those of you that know this channel and you're welcome. Would I like this game?
[2403.38s -> 2413.96s]  Congratulations, guys. All right. We have such a big show ahead. Now I wanted to mention right
[2413.96s -> 2419.00s]  now on Twitch, we've got over 900,000 concurrent viewers watching the show right now, including
[2419.00s -> 2423.48s]  co-streamers. So sounds like you guys are excited about what we have going on. And of course,
[2424.20s -> 2436.04s]  6,000 people here. I'm like 2% of that. What? Wait, where is it?
[2442.36s -> 2443.56s]  Where is that?
[2443.80s -> 2448.04s]  World premieres are a big part of this show. And you guys have a lot of expectations on
[2448.04s -> 2455.48s]  the internet for things or lots of rumors, lots of leaks. And then sometimes there's surprises that
[2455.48s -> 2458.20s]  I don't I don't know. I don't know any I don't know any of these people.
[2460.04s -> 2478.47s]  I can't I can't I don't know. Let's suppose that you were able every night to dream any
[2478.47s -> 2486.06s]  dream you wanted to dream. And then you could have the power within one night to dream.
[2488.54s -> 2500.92s]  And what if you died naturally as you began your adventure of dreams? Would you still do it?
[2502.04s -> 2511.06s]  But now let's um, let's have a surprise. Let's have a dream which isn't under control.
[2513.78s -> 2518.41s]  We'll get more adventurous.
[2521.74s -> 2524.38s]  Further and further out gambles as to what you would dream.
[2525.18s -> 2528.22s]  You guys are telling me to be quiet. And finally you will dream.
[2528.38s -> 2537.10s]  I knew this wasn't a fucking reveal. There's another ad for xbox. Wait, that's the console.
[2547.16s -> 2559.64s]  The xbox dell inspiron. The xbox all the way to the left at best buy pc.
[2559.64s -> 2581.64s]  So it's just a computer. He's the head of xbox. Please welcome Bill Spencer. Is it just a computer?
[2582.52s -> 2586.52s]  That's a computer. That's right guys. It's a computer. It's a computer.
[2586.84s -> 2594.50s]  It's a computer. For 18 years and three generations, we've designed xbox consoles
[2594.50s -> 2600.98s]  to power your dreams. We see a future where you're instantly absorbed in your games.
[2601.70s -> 2607.38s]  Where worlds are even more like-like, immersive, responsive, and surprising.
[2608.90s -> 2612.02s]  Where you are at the center of your gaming experience.
[2612.82s -> 2618.50s]  Next holiday, xbox series x will lead us into the future of console gaming.
[2618.98s -> 2626.58s]  Our fastest, most powerful xbox will set a new bar for performance, speed, compatibility.
[2627.70s -> 2634.34s]  Developers around the globe are already hard at work building games for xbox series x.
[2634.34s -> 2636.26s]  You've revealed the console at a game award.
[2636.66s -> 2643.30s]  Our 15 xbox game studios are developing the largest and most creatively diverse lineup
[2643.30s -> 2651.70s]  of exclusive games in our history. Tonight, I'm proud to reveal a project early in development
[2652.34s -> 2657.78s]  from an incredibly talented creative team who are no strangers to the game awards.
[2658.74s -> 2664.74s]  What you're about to see was all captured in engine as being built
[2665.38s -> 2675.26s]  to take full advantage of xbox series x. Conquer's bad for day two.
[2737.53s -> 2781.45s]  Is that game any good? I didn't play the first one. Do I play video games? I don't play any
[2781.45s -> 2785.78s]  fucking video games. Who should I vote for? Oh, I missed the voting period.
[2797.85s -> 2802.09s]  All right, the fun is just beginning. Let me assure you, we've got some other great surprises
[2802.09s -> 2806.09s]  coming up here at the game awards. Now we just ran a poll on twitch to see who you think is
[2806.09s -> 2811.37s]  going to be recognized as the best esports player and the results are in. Twitch community picked
[2811.37s -> 2820.02s]  Faker. All right. 40% of the vote. Did you guys put that? You guys can do that, right?
[2820.02s -> 2823.86s]  You guys called it correctly. And still to come in the show, we've got performances by Green Day
[2823.86s -> 2828.42s]  and Grimes. More amazing music from the game awards orchestra. Special announcements from
[2828.42s -> 2833.78s]  League of Legends, Fortnite, and Apex Legends. Norman Reedus is here. Gotta make it count.
[2833.78s -> 2839.46s]  Reggie's in the house, of course. And we've got a lot more surprises that is all coming up.
[2839.54s -> 2844.10s]  But first, last year, we started a new initiative with Facebook to spotlight unique stories about
[2844.10s -> 2849.70s]  the gaming community around the world. This year, we've got three new amazing stories about global
[2849.70s -> 2855.06s]  gaming citizens. I'm so proud to have these in the show. And I just can't wait to share them
[2855.06s -> 2859.54s]  with you tonight. Here's our first gaming system. I'm not talking. I told you to shut up. I didn't
[2859.54s -> 2869.16s]  say anything. I was born an Afghan refugee. Growing up with the fear of am I going to be able to go
[2869.16s -> 2874.60s]  to school or not was always with me. I'm not able to go back to my country.
[2876.76s -> 2883.96s]  Afghanistan is a very traditional country. There is a huge problem here for women accessing
[2883.96s -> 2892.14s]  education. So I decided enough is enough. And I thought about coding. Code to Inspire is the first
[2892.14s -> 2898.46s]  computer coding school for girls in Afghanistan. We've developed so far more than 20 games.
[2898.54s -> 2904.06s]  Our students told me we are very tired of playing games that the men are superheroes.
[2904.06s -> 2909.58s]  And it's always pretty white men. So I was like, then why are you just going to create your own game?
[2912.70s -> 2919.10s]  When they see the game that they are playing, I'm made by women. That's an empowerment itself.
[2919.82s -> 2923.98s]  They understand that they have a voice and they should be heard.
[2931.11s -> 2933.99s]  Is it possible that the past and future are colliding?
[2935.67s -> 2940.46s]  This thing's sick, by the way, but just don't touch it. Be careful.
[2955.21s -> 2956.49s]  Up to 50% off.
[2962.09s -> 2966.89s]  Wait, the Joker and Harley Quinn.
[2971.37s -> 2973.13s]  And aren't you just as creepy as?
[2974.09s -> 2984.14s]  Don't they have their own game made by the same company? Rated M for Mature.
[3014.63s -> 3016.07s]  That guy just destroyed her.
[3017.03s -> 3019.51s]  To play any time, anywhere.
[3040.30s -> 3057.00s]  Somebody in chat did real good. What is this? I'm interested in this.
[3057.96s -> 3072.49s]  Wait, it's only for Oculus? No, it's not.
[3079.10s -> 3085.34s]  Do you exclude VR exclusives? Come on, the thing's like 700 bucks.
[3086.62s -> 3101.11s]  Some of these headsets and peripherals, it's like 800 bucks. The Rift is 400. I could buy two PS4s.
[3101.99s -> 3115.27s]  PS4 is 299. I could buy like one and a half PS4s.
[3131.77s -> 3138.09s]  Can I have your half PS4? What's going on? No, it's mine.
[3142.76s -> 3148.20s]  As some of you may know, I have my own gaming related injury recently.
[3150.07s -> 3155.99s]  I went for that triangle button and next thing you know, I'm on the floor hot and
[3157.03s -> 3166.10s]  2k is no joke. So once again, esports is the fastest growing sport on the planet
[3166.10s -> 3173.30s]  and still breaking records with massive multimillion dollar prize, uh, prize pools and
[3173.30s -> 3179.30s]  the award for best esports player recognizes both outstanding play regardless of the game
[3179.86s -> 3182.82s]  and also good sportsmanship. So here are the nominees.
[3185.45s -> 3186.97s]  Best esports player.
[3187.53s -> 3191.53s]  Your Fortnite world champion, Boogaloo.
[3194.86s -> 3202.78s]  You got a huge throat. No, I don't. My throat is normal. I have a normal throat.
[3204.14s -> 3217.91s]  Best esports. All right, I'm going to say what's the highest skill ceiling? What game has the
[3217.91s -> 3226.04s]  highest skill ceiling? And the game award for best esports player goes to Boogaloo.
[3254.34s -> 3258.34s]  Thank you guys so much. How do you think I can do all these powerful voices?
[3260.50s -> 3267.62s]  I have extra thick airway. My family, my friends, my team sentinels, and most importantly,
[3267.62s -> 3272.74s]  Epic Games for making any of this possible. And I'm so glad to be a part of this community
[3272.74s -> 3275.78s]  and I can't wait to see what the future holds. Thank you guys so much.
[3276.90s -> 3288.41s]  Those patrols are actually kind of cool. Ninja sitting back there going like,
[3288.41s -> 3307.30s]  should have been. It don't really matter though, because ninja is at that spot in celebrity status
[3307.30s -> 3311.46s]  where you don't have to win anymore in anything. You just, you just participate in everything.
[3312.18s -> 3313.70s]  You know what I mean? Like he doesn't, it doesn't matter.
[3335.54s -> 3342.33s]  What is this? Beautiful, deadly, right in our way. That's about right.
[3342.97s -> 3357.14s]  Destiny 2. Destiny 2 again? It blends together guys. It does. It just blends together. No,
[3357.14s -> 3363.93s]  it's something else. It's, you know, it's the same like lights, the same like blue and pink,
[3364.49s -> 3371.78s]  bright, like refracting lights. I feel like, like the armor and the lights, it's the blue
[3372.74s -> 3378.92s]  neon and blue and red and green neon refracting lights. It's something about it. I don't know
[3378.92s -> 3385.74s]  what it is. It's in every game now. Oh, you noticed that. Yeah. PlayStation 5. All right.
[3385.74s -> 3390.06s]  This show is on fire. I'm here with Keith Lee, the CEO of Counterplay and Steve Gibson,
[3390.06s -> 3396.38s]  the president of Gearbox Publishing. Guys, brand new announcement, brand new IP new game.
[3396.38s -> 3402.70s]  What is Godfall? Godfall is a brand new IP set in a brand new fantasy universe
[3402.70s -> 3408.54s]  filled with heroic knights and mysterious magic. We call it a looter slasher. All right. So,
[3408.54s -> 3413.26s]  looter slasher. Tell us a bit about like, how is this going to play? So, we're here to reinvent
[3413.26s -> 3418.86s]  combat for loot driven action RPGs. We'll have third person real-time melee combat as you hunt
[3418.86s -> 3424.06s]  for awesome loot. You can also play the game in solo as well as in co-op. It's going to be
[3424.06s -> 3427.82s]  fun for everyone. Well, it looks absolutely incredible. That was all in-engine. You know,
[3427.82s -> 3431.74s]  you can see the game that we're going to get to play there. Steve, you know, from Gearbox's
[3431.74s -> 3434.78s]  point of view, you guys nominated tonight, obviously, Borderlands. Congrats on that.
[3434.78s -> 3438.46s]  Thank you. But how do you guys fit into this picture with Sony and with Counterplay?
[3438.46s -> 3444.78s]  Oh, man. You know we love our co-op and our gear at Gearbox. So, here we are, man. And when Keith
[3444.78s -> 3451.10s]  showed us Godfall, it was so amazing to us. We had to call our friends over at Sony, our friends
[3451.10s -> 3456.22s]  over at Epic, say, hey, help us make this work on your technology and your hardware. Keith,
[3456.22s -> 3460.06s]  we're going to do everything we can for you, man. And we're excited. We're so excited. Announce
[3460.06s -> 3463.50s]  this is going to be announced. This is launched exclusively on the PlayStation 5 and Epic Game
[3463.50s -> 3471.42s]  Store this holiday. Holiday 2020. I didn't say anything. Shut up. This is amazing. Well,
[3471.42s -> 3476.54s]  guys, congratulations. I was molding my face like it was clay. You sure will. Awesome. All right.
[3476.54s -> 3480.14s]  Congrats on the announcement. Awesome, guys. All right. Well, we'd like to welcome some,
[3480.14s -> 3483.74s]  we'd like to recognize some other of our winners tonight. I got something bored. All right, get
[3483.74s -> 3488.86s]  up. The category of best audio design for best in-game audio and sound design, those nominees are
[3489.50s -> 3494.70s]  Call of Duty Modern Warfare. It's the neon green and red neon lights. Best stranding.
[3496.06s -> 3504.17s]  Here's five. Resident Evil 2. Okay, fan favorite. And Sekiro Shadows die twice.
[3505.61s -> 3510.01s]  I mean, Mr. Rex walking around. If it's not Resident Evil 2, the game's dead. Call of Duty
[3510.01s -> 3514.57s]  Modern Warfare. No, no, no, the game's dead. The game is dead. Call of Duty Modern Warfare.

[3523.13s -> 3530.54s]  Fire Emblem Three Houses. Total War Three Kingdoms. Tropico Six and Wargroove.
[3531.34s -> 3540.94s]  And the game award in that category goes to Fire Emblem Three Houses. All right. In the category of
[3540.94s -> 3546.46s]  content creator of the year, content creator who made an important and positive impact on
[3546.46s -> 3554.14s]  the industry this year. The nominees are Courage, who's in the house here, Dr. Lupo, Ewok,
[3555.10s -> 3566.89s]  Gref, and Shroud. And the game award goes to Shroud. Fortnite. The game award goes to Fortnite.
[3566.89s -> 3570.89s]  World premieres and announcements to start off the show. And we've talked about Xbox,
[3570.89s -> 3575.93s]  we've talked about PlayStation, another platform we probably should talk about now.
[3575.93s -> 3581.61s]  We have another world premiere, brand new game announcement that I don't think you guys are
[3581.61s -> 3584.97s]  expecting, but we're really excited to share with you here on the Game Awards. Check this out.
[3596.30s -> 3605.98s]  Hitman Switch. It is time to choose. Accept your fate and await oblivion.
[3607.38s -> 3616.34s]  Or make a stand and fight for survival. Step into the light, young hero. Be brave.
[3616.34s -> 3621.43s]  During the movie you can't, you can't, you can't go to the bathroom during the movie.
[3636.09s -> 3644.01s]  I like the 3D on top of 3D on top of 3D. Looks cool.
[3648.81s -> 3659.00s]  I think people probably gonna, new poll has started. What's the poll?
[3660.74s -> 3665.30s]  What poll? Who do you think should win the 2019 best play on Twitch?
[3668.62s -> 3670.94s]  Best play on, what was the play?
[3673.26s -> 3673.82s]  What was the play?
[3673.82s -> 3678.22s]  My fellow Canadian, Rebecca Ford, live operations and community director at Digital Extremes.
[3678.22s -> 3681.34s]  Is that for Canada or for Rebecca? For both of them. All right,
[3681.34s -> 3686.30s]  Rebecca, welcome to the Game Awards. You've been up here before. Warframe. Tell us,
[3686.30s -> 3687.58s]  what's the latest on Warframe?
[3687.58s -> 3690.86s]  You know, we've been making this game for seven years and each year we update it with
[3691.18s -> 3695.02s]  space ninja flair, but we think it's time to go space pirate and this whole
[3695.02s -> 3697.82s]  Empyrean thing is what our community wants to know about.
[3697.82s -> 3701.02s]  Yes, I know you guys have teased that. What can you tell us about it?
[3701.02s -> 3701.82s]  What's gonna come out?
[3701.82s -> 3703.98s]  Well, we were thinking on PC.
[3703.98s -> 3704.62s]  What is this?
[3704.62s -> 3705.50s]  Right now.
[3705.50s -> 3709.42s]  Oh, okay. Here we go. So I'm here live right now. All right. That's fantastic.
[3709.42s -> 3711.74s]  And people will get their hands on it tonight.
[3711.74s -> 3713.58s]  Anything else that we should be keeping in mind?
[3713.58s -> 3715.74s]  Yeah. Our PlayStation 4 and Xbox one 10.
[3715.74s -> 3718.06s]  Oh, have the rising tide update, which means we are now
[3718.22s -> 3724.86s]  following anyone. Yes, I do. I follow Vinny. I follow Vinesauce. That's bullshit.
[3727.10s -> 3728.70s]  I don't follow literally anyone.
[3730.54s -> 3731.34s]  Where's my stream?
[3733.66s -> 3736.06s]  Where's my stream? All right. Who cares about my stream?
[3740.98s -> 3741.78s]  I am coast.
[3758.71s -> 3759.43s]  I do though.
[3760.87s -> 3764.23s]  Oh, it's because I'm not logged in to this. I'm not logged in.
[3764.23s -> 3766.23s]  This is just a browser plugin. Okay, I get it.
[3767.11s -> 3807.98s]  Stop it.
[3808.84s -> 3812.68s]  Tonight, we're happy to welcome Samsung as a new partner of the Game Awards.
[3812.68s -> 3815.64s]  And throughout the night, you'll be hearing from my fellow Canadian,
[3815.64s -> 3819.88s]  lots of Canadians tonight, Linus Tech Tips about Samsung's QLED TVs,
[3819.88s -> 3823.16s]  which are optimized for the best gaming experience. Take a look.
[3825.02s -> 3828.38s]  I'm Linus from Linus Tech Tips, and I'll be talking about some of the ways living
[3828.38s -> 3835.42s]  room gaming is better than ever. When I was a kid, my first gaming TV was about this big.
[3835.50s -> 3837.66s]  And it had a VHS player built into it.
[3837.66s -> 3838.06s]  Me too.
[3838.06s -> 3843.42s]  Not very immersive. With a Samsung QLED TV, not only can you see more than ever before,
[3843.42s -> 3847.02s]  but at 4K resolution with sizes of up to 82 inches.
[3847.02s -> 3848.62s]  Linus, you're sitting too close.
[3848.62s -> 3849.42s]  Unbelievable.
[3849.42s -> 3852.30s]  Linus, sit back. You're going to hurt your eye.
[3852.30s -> 3853.74s]  You can game without worry.
[3853.74s -> 3854.62s]  That's too close.
[3856.46s -> 3860.14s]  See, that just hurt me. And I'm like far away. This is like a 25 inch TV.
[3860.14s -> 3862.70s]  And I play Fortnite and I'm 14.
[3863.50s -> 3865.82s]  Linus, you're sitting too close to the TV, man.
[3865.82s -> 3867.34s]  A very small following.
[3868.94s -> 3874.54s]  In the past 14 months, everything's really taken off and it's been absolutely incredible.
[3875.18s -> 3877.66s]  I mean, I've become the first woman in Faze Clan.
[3879.02s -> 3885.69s]  My goal is to see many more females playing and considered at an equal level.
[3885.69s -> 3889.37s]  And I really want to see that explode in the gaming world.
[3889.37s -> 3890.81s]  I think that would be really nice.
[3891.53s -> 3899.96s]  And he walks here with us tonight. We're so glad to have her with us.
[3899.96s -> 3900.52s]  All right.
[3900.52s -> 3902.12s]  Oh, I can vote on this one.
[3902.12s -> 3904.76s]  He's the senior art director for Magic the Gathering.
[3904.76s -> 3906.20s]  Dan, welcome to the Game Awards.
[3906.20s -> 3906.76s]  Thank you.
[3906.76s -> 3907.88s]  Probably no more Heroes 3.
[3907.88s -> 3909.32s]  You're our brand. What's next?
[3909.96s -> 3913.56s]  Well, Jeff, I'm excited to tell you that in January,
[3913.56s -> 3917.00s]  Magic will be returning to one of our most beloved worlds.
[3917.80s -> 3922.28s]  So the last time we went to Theros, a world of gods, myths, and monsters,
[3922.28s -> 3926.12s]  we saw our hero, Elspeth Tyrell, my favorite planeswalker,
[3926.76s -> 3929.80s]  betrayed by the gods and banished to walk the underworld.
[3929.80s -> 3933.72s]  But now our hero is ready to defy death and escape her fate.
[3934.44s -> 3937.48s]  And I'm here to give you a sneak peek at what's in store for her.
[3938.36s -> 3940.76s]  Now with music by Ramin Jawadi.
[3940.76s -> 3944.20s]  This is the trailer for Theros Beyond Death.
[3944.20s -> 3944.84s]  All right, check it out.
[3944.84s -> 3946.68s]  Watch this trailer. I'm going to run and pee and be right back.
[4054.18s -> 4062.31s]  This is probably why I lean into my friend.
[4062.31s -> 4063.43s]  I'm sitting next to the movie and go,
[4064.39s -> 4065.34s]  what happened?
[4065.34s -> 4066.86s]  Something fucking major happened.
[4066.86s -> 4068.62s]  And your friend is just sitting there going,
[4068.62s -> 4073.26s]  I, the guy with the green hat came in and there was a firefight.
[4073.26s -> 4077.58s]  And I don't know, I couldn't, it was fast.
[4077.58s -> 4078.46s]  New game announcements.
[4078.46s -> 4079.66s]  Just keep rolling here at the Game Awards.
[4079.66s -> 4081.34s]  Eventually we'll get some games you already know about,
[4081.34s -> 4083.18s]  but let's keep going with things you haven't seen before.
[4083.18s -> 4084.46s]  Here's another world premiere.
[4104.79s -> 4105.51s]  Why do they do this?
[4107.26s -> 4109.98s]  Yes, we know it's a big movie screen.
[4111.29s -> 4112.25s]  Why do we have to pull out?
[4112.81s -> 4117.94s]  It's almost like to prove how big the screen is.
[4120.44s -> 4123.02s]  What?
[4123.02s -> 4124.06s]  What the fuck was that?
[4124.70s -> 4129.42s]  She's a creative director and the lead art designer from the Evil Within series.
[4129.42s -> 4132.14s]  Please welcome Ikumi Nakamura.
[4136.90s -> 4139.06s]  What was the, what was the last thing?
[4140.55s -> 4141.59s]  There was some dogs barking.
[4141.59s -> 4145.11s]  Please bear bear with my English.
[4146.55s -> 4152.07s]  Okay, good art can change over time.
[4152.95s -> 4155.51s]  But great art stays great.
[4156.55s -> 4164.70s]  Great art, great art sparks joy in our brains
[4164.70s -> 4168.54s]  and helps us to change the way we think.
[4170.62s -> 4175.34s]  Because sometimes we need to change to survive.
[4176.70s -> 4180.86s]  This year I had a big change in my life
[4181.66s -> 4183.98s]  and it's been a crazy year.
[4184.46s -> 4189.94s]  Is it Evil Within 2?
[4190.98s -> 4193.67s]  Evil Within 2?
[4193.67s -> 4194.95s]  But I'm alive.
[4195.67s -> 4197.91s]  Was it a crazy year for you?
[4202.02s -> 4204.98s]  You are not alone because I'm here.
[4206.65s -> 4211.53s]  And we have great games with great art.
[4212.49s -> 4217.69s]  But here are the nominees for Best Art Direction are...
[4218.33s -> 4218.89s]  Look at it!
[4221.32s -> 4223.00s]  Best Art Direction.
[4223.00s -> 4225.40s]  Best Art Direction presented by Samsung QLED.
[4226.12s -> 4227.80s]  Samsung, you didn't make any of this stuff.
[4227.80s -> 4228.30s]  Please.
[4229.40s -> 4246.97s]  Yeah, Sekiro was.
[4246.97s -> 4248.49s]  Sekiro did look pretty great.
[4248.49s -> 4249.69s]  It was pretty good.
[4249.69s -> 4250.19s]  Yeah.
[4251.61s -> 4253.37s]  I would say it was probably Sekiro.
[4255.37s -> 4257.93s]  As you know, I am a fortune teller.
[4261.34s -> 4270.31s]  I can see, and the winner is...
[4270.31s -> 4271.11s]  Did you just show it?
[4271.99s -> 4272.49s]  Control!
[4285.72s -> 4303.48s]  Control is amazing.
[4303.48s -> 4304.20s]  I didn't play it.
[4308.55s -> 4309.51s]  This is incredible.
[4309.51s -> 4312.71s]  Trying to avoid any explicit language right now.
[4312.71s -> 4313.75s]  Instead of being Sekiro.
[4316.39s -> 4320.23s]  I think the big thank you goes to the art director,
[4320.23s -> 4321.67s]  Janne Polkinen.
[4321.67s -> 4323.51s]  He is an amazing person.
[4323.51s -> 4324.55s]  Was the art director not there?
[4324.55s -> 4326.31s]  He's worked at Remedy for a long while.
[4326.31s -> 4331.03s]  And he had this crystal clear vision of what he wanted to achieve with Control.
[4331.75s -> 4335.03s]  And he did amazing things together with his team.
[4335.03s -> 4338.23s]  Also I have to thank Stuart MacDonald, who is the world design director,
[4338.23s -> 4339.99s]  and Aunty Boomi who handled the characters,
[4339.99s -> 4342.95s]  and all the creepy monsters that existed in this game.
[4344.07s -> 4348.15s]  And I can't imagine a better group of artists,
[4348.15s -> 4350.47s]  intelligence, creative people to work with.
[4350.47s -> 4351.99s]  And this is thanks to you guys.
[4352.79s -> 4354.71s]  Thank you so much for your work.
[4356.60s -> 4357.56s]  Does Control look good?
[4358.60s -> 4359.10s]  They're...
[4360.04s -> 4362.44s]  I don't even know what Control is.
[4362.44s -> 4365.24s]  I know it's like you can manipulate the world with your hands
[4365.24s -> 4366.52s]  and you have all the superpowers, right?
[4366.52s -> 4368.36s]  You have all the superpowers, you can probably climb the walls.
[4369.80s -> 4370.60s]  Something like that.
[4370.60s -> 4372.84s]  Congratulations to the guys at Remedy.
[4372.84s -> 4374.20s]  We've got lots more words coming up.
[4374.20s -> 4375.96s]  But right now I'm here with Donald Mustard,
[4375.96s -> 4378.36s]  worldwide creative director for Epic Games.
[4378.36s -> 4379.48s]  Donald, welcome back to the game.
[4379.48s -> 4380.68s]  It's a yearly thing, I feel like.
[4380.68s -> 4382.12s]  Here we go, season three Fortnite.
[4382.12s -> 4382.68s]  Here it comes.
[4382.68s -> 4386.04s]  Well, you guys have built quite a franchise in Fortnite.
[4386.04s -> 4389.72s]  And the last couple years have just been so crazy for you guys.
[4389.72s -> 4392.52s]  But what I love is that you're constantly innovating with this game.
[4392.52s -> 4393.48s]  That's what we're trying to know.
[4393.48s -> 4398.04s]  It's, you know, we think we're all just trying to make stuff that we think is fun,
[4398.04s -> 4399.32s]  that we think is cool.
[4399.32s -> 4404.36s]  And you never quite expect something to take off the way that Fortnite did, right?
[4404.36s -> 4407.88s]  But once that momentum happened, we're just like, man, how do we just...
[4407.88s -> 4408.92s]  We've got to lean in.
[4408.92s -> 4413.56s]  And how do we find ways to really just push the idea of what
[4413.56s -> 4416.28s]  a persistent virtual place can be?
[4416.28s -> 4417.40s]  And so that's why even this year...
[4417.40s -> 4418.44s]  A Marshal concert wasn't...
[4418.44s -> 4419.48s]  The concert, yeah.
[4419.48s -> 4422.04s]  We start the year off with a concert that has, you know,
[4422.68s -> 4423.96s]  over 10 million people in it.
[4423.96s -> 4428.04s]  You know, we roll into huge monster fights.
[4428.04s -> 4431.24s]  And we've got a thing we've been fighting forever to like,
[4431.24s -> 4436.52s]  how do we find a way to suck the entire world into the zero point black hole
[4436.52s -> 4438.92s]  and turn the game off and like all this stuff?
[4438.92s -> 4440.92s]  But that all in some ways, I think,
[4440.92s -> 4443.48s]  pales in comparison to what's about to happen this weekend.
[4443.48s -> 4443.98s]  Right.
[4444.52s -> 4449.00s]  Yeah, something pretty cool is gonna happen in a few hours, you know, and on Saturday.
[4449.00s -> 4452.52s]  On Saturday, you guys probably have seen teasing a little bit about
[4452.52s -> 4457.16s]  something that's happening at Risky Reels tied to Star Wars.
[4457.16s -> 4457.88s]  Yeah.
[4457.88s -> 4460.12s]  If you do Fortnite VR, isn't it just gonna be like this?
[4460.12s -> 4461.24s]  Yes, and it's pretty cool.
[4461.24s -> 4462.28s]  What can you tell us about it?
[4462.28s -> 4463.40s]  Like, don't you have to like look down at it?
[4463.40s -> 4465.56s]  You know, I probably can't tell you much.
[4465.56s -> 4467.96s]  But I have a friend who can.
[4467.96s -> 4469.96s]  Okay, let's take a look.
[4469.96s -> 4471.16s]  How do you do Fortnite VR?
[4472.12s -> 4472.92s]  Thanks, Donald.
[4472.92s -> 4476.36s]  Hey, everyone, it's JJ Abrams, director of The Rise of Skywalker.
[4476.36s -> 4480.12s]  Join me in Fortnite on Saturday for an exclusive look at the movie.
[4480.12s -> 4481.48s]  To see the whole thing in the game.
[4481.48s -> 4484.28s]  So I'll see you in Fortnite on Saturday.
[4484.28s -> 4484.78s]  Thanks.
[4487.74s -> 4490.78s]  Yeah, I see you Saturday for Fortnite.
[4490.78s -> 4492.46s]  And I think, you know, some people online are like,
[4492.46s -> 4494.06s]  oh, you're just running a clip or whatever.
[4494.06s -> 4495.02s]  And I don't know how much you want to reveal,
[4495.02s -> 4497.10s]  but you and I have been talking all year about, you know,
[4497.10s -> 4498.54s]  building a live experience around this.
[4498.54s -> 4500.62s]  I'm excited. I'm going to get to actually be in the game as well.
[4500.62s -> 4503.02s]  Kind of interacting with JJ.
[4503.02s -> 4504.54s]  And I don't know how much you want to tell us about it,
[4504.54s -> 4507.82s]  but it's going to be a live participatory experience, right?
[4507.82s -> 4512.22s]  I think it's going to be like something that no one's ever seen before, ever.
[4512.22s -> 4514.62s]  I mean, JJ and Jeff, we're going to be live.
[4517.74s -> 4519.90s]  Oh, and that's the glider we're going to get, I think.
[4519.90s -> 4520.86s]  There's also going to be that.
[4520.86s -> 4521.26s]  Exactly.
[4521.26s -> 4521.90s]  Wait, so hold on.
[4524.86s -> 4527.78s]  That's what happens when you do it live.
[4528.50s -> 4529.30s]  So you never know.
[4529.30s -> 4530.18s]  There's an attack happening.
[4530.18s -> 4533.38s]  Everyone who shows up, like as you drop out of the battle bus,
[4533.38s -> 4534.74s]  you're all going to pop those out.
[4534.74s -> 4537.46s]  Like everyone that shows up is going to get Thai whispers.
[4537.46s -> 4538.02s]  It's awesome.
[4538.02s -> 4542.58s]  You're flying around and JJ and Jeff will be there live in the game.
[4542.58s -> 4545.94s]  And we're going to see this awesome clip from Star Wars.
[4545.94s -> 4549.30s]  It's a brief, but I've seen it many times.
[4549.30s -> 4549.94s]  From Star Wars.
[4549.94s -> 4550.82s]  Very, very good.
[4550.82s -> 4552.42s]  What clip from Star Wars?
[4552.42s -> 4553.38s]  And then some other crazy stuff is going to happen.
[4553.38s -> 4555.14s]  It's my favorite part of Star Wars.
[4555.22s -> 4557.22s]  It's when Han Solo said Boba Fett.
[4557.22s -> 4559.78s]  I'm really excited about sort of what this means, I think, for sort of
[4559.78s -> 4560.74s]  programming inside of games.
[4560.74s -> 4561.38s]  That's better.
[4561.38s -> 4561.86s]  Use that one.
[4561.86s -> 4563.22s]  Shared experiences like the Game Awards.
[4563.22s -> 4564.90s]  People all coming together watching this.
[4564.90s -> 4566.50s]  But this is inside the game world.
[4566.50s -> 4568.66s]  I'm really excited about what is going to happen on Saturday.
[4568.66s -> 4570.82s]  So right from the Game Awards to that.
[4570.82s -> 4575.06s]  But before then, I know you've got some other, some cool things that people can
[4575.06s -> 4575.94s]  pick up in Fortnite.
[4575.94s -> 4576.34s]  We do.
[4576.34s -> 4577.70s]  So there's one more thing.
[4577.70s -> 4583.94s]  So right now you can go to Fortnite and these are now available in the game.
[4583.94s -> 4585.78s]  And they're some of my favorite characters of all time.
[4585.78s -> 4588.10s]  Rey and Finn and the awesome new Sith Trooper.
[4588.10s -> 4590.34s]  And they're in the game right now.
[4590.34s -> 4593.22s]  You're going to get loaded up for Saturday.
[4593.22s -> 4593.78s]  Amazing.
[4593.78s -> 4597.78s]  Well, I got to say, we are really excited about what you guys have put together with
[4597.78s -> 4600.90s]  you, Lucas and Disney, to have this come together.
[4600.90s -> 4603.38s]  So the Sith Troopers are just never easy to pull off.
[4603.38s -> 4604.74s]  Dairy Queen Cherry Dip.
[4604.74s -> 4605.78s]  I'm really excited about what it's going to be.
[4605.78s -> 4606.98s]  So Saturday.
[4606.98s -> 4608.90s]  Saturday, 2 p.m. Eastern.
[4608.90s -> 4609.86s]  And it's live.
[4609.86s -> 4611.30s]  Like we're doing it live.
[4611.30s -> 4613.46s]  And it's going to be amazing and crazy.
[4613.46s -> 4614.26s]  Just like this.
[4614.26s -> 4616.98s]  I was going to say, we'll be there and there'll probably be TIE fighters.
[4616.98s -> 4618.66s]  There'll be other crazy things going on.
[4618.66s -> 4621.38s]  Donald, thanks as always for coming by the Game Awards.
[4621.38s -> 4621.70s]  Good luck.
[4621.70s -> 4623.46s]  I know you guys are up for a bunch of awards tonight as well.
[4624.18s -> 4626.34s]  And we've got much more Game Awards coming up.
[4626.34s -> 4626.82s]  Thank you.
[4626.82s -> 4628.58s]  So where's the Star Wars clip?
[4628.58s -> 4630.02s]  I want to see the clip from Star Wars.
[4630.02s -> 4630.34s]  All right.
[4630.34s -> 4632.82s]  Well, we've got a lot of brand new game announcements tonight.
[4632.82s -> 4634.18s]  Where was the Star Wars clip?
[4634.18s -> 4634.90s]  Did they not show it?
[4634.90s -> 4637.62s]  The next one comes from a team up in my home country of Canada.
[4637.62s -> 4641.62s]  I keep mentioning Canada, but this is a game that I think you'll be surprised by.
[4641.70s -> 4643.94s]  I thought he was going to show his favorite Star Wars clip.
[4643.94s -> 4644.98s]  It's a pretty cool thing to announce at the Game Awards.
[4644.98s -> 4646.02s]  So am I stupid?
[4657.00s -> 4659.83s]  Yep.
[4659.83s -> 4672.79s]  I don't want to live forever.
[4672.79s -> 4673.35s]  Demons.
[4687.70s -> 4688.20s]  What?
[4710.57s -> 4718.20s]  Is that a demon?
[4742.26s -> 4747.06s]  Sons of the Forest.
[4749.29s -> 4754.42s]  Sons of the Forest coming out end night tonight.
[4757.35s -> 4758.31s]  Sons of the Forest.
[4758.31s -> 4759.59s]  We got some cool stuff tonight.
[4759.91s -> 4763.59s]  Well, one of the most played games in the world is League of Legends.
[4763.59s -> 4768.15s]  And tonight we're happy to have Riot and its new Riot Forge division with us to
[4768.15s -> 4772.07s]  reveal their first single player experience for the franchise.
[4772.07s -> 4773.59s]  What happened to the one that they were making?
[4773.59s -> 4776.15s]  What happened to that Monster Hunter game they were making?
[4777.99s -> 4778.63s]  Is that still going on?
[4778.63s -> 4779.35s]  Did they can that?
[4781.83s -> 4797.83s]  My king, long time has come for revenge.
[4799.00s -> 4812.42s]  My master, Azmogand, away with the prey.
[4840.26s -> 4843.14s]  Ruin King, Airship Syndicate, I'm here with Joe Mad.
[4843.14s -> 4846.50s]  Joe, you guys have made some amazing games over the years.
[4847.06s -> 4851.06s]  First of all, congratulations on working with Riot to reveal you guys making the first game,
[4851.06s -> 4851.62s]  what it is.
[4852.26s -> 4854.18s]  Tell us more about what we just saw on that teaser.
[4854.18s -> 4855.78s]  How do you do single player League of Legends?
[4855.78s -> 4858.34s]  I'm so excited we can finally talk about this.
[4858.34s -> 4860.34s]  I was sure I would leak it before now.
[4860.34s -> 4864.02s]  But we are doing the first ever Riot Forge game.
[4865.14s -> 4869.22s]  And as you saw, it is the Ruin King, a League of Legends story.
[4870.34s -> 4875.78s]  We're basically building on our experience making Battle Chasers and Darksiders
[4875.78s -> 4880.18s]  to create a story-driven turn-based RPG.
[4880.18s -> 4882.98s]  We have a new take on turn-based combat that's really cool.
[4883.62s -> 4887.62s]  Obviously the visual, the art and visuals that our studio is known for.
[4888.42s -> 4891.62s]  And the story takes place after Burning Tides.
[4892.26s -> 4894.34s]  So everyone believes Gangplank is dead.
[4895.22s -> 4896.82s]  Bilgewater is in chaos.
[4896.82s -> 4900.98s]  And you'll actually play as some League champions and explore Bilgewater,
[4901.62s -> 4904.82s]  the Shadow Isles, and we have a lot of other surprises as well.
[4904.82s -> 4905.54s]  And Poros.
[4905.54s -> 4906.98s]  They're mandatory, apparently.
[4906.98s -> 4907.22s]  All right.
[4907.22s -> 4909.86s]  Well, it sounds like this is something you've been working on for a little while, too, right?
[4910.98s -> 4911.54s]  We have.
[4911.54s -> 4912.74s]  We have, yes.
[4912.74s -> 4914.02s]  And I can't say any more.
[4914.02s -> 4914.50s]  Okay.
[4914.50s -> 4915.78s]  That's all you're allowed to say.
[4915.78s -> 4915.94s]  All right.
[4915.94s -> 4919.54s]  Well, it's so exciting to have Riot with us here at the Game Awards for the first time.
[4919.54s -> 4920.34s]  That's all I can say.
[4920.34s -> 4924.82s]  Do you like the green swooshes in that voice actor?
[4924.82s -> 4925.94s]  Well, thanks so much for announcing with us.
[4925.94s -> 4927.38s]  I really love the green swooshes.
[4927.38s -> 4930.74s]  I know all the League of Legends fans around the entire world who are tuned in tonight.
[4930.74s -> 4931.94s]  So, Joe, I can't wait.
[4931.94s -> 4932.66s]  I don't get this.
[4932.66s -> 4933.22s]  I don't.
[4933.22s -> 4935.14s]  And it's an indie-free weapon.
[4935.14s -> 4935.54s]  I will.
[4935.54s -> 4936.50s]  I'm good right now.
[4936.50s -> 4937.54s]  Thank you very much, Joe.
[4937.54s -> 4939.86s]  Great announcement, League of Legends.
[4939.86s -> 4940.34s]  Fantastic.
[4940.66s -> 4942.50s]  Talks over, like, 12 seconds ago.
[4944.98s -> 4948.10s]  When we come back, a performance by Grimes.
[4948.10s -> 4953.06s]  The award for best action game with Norman Reedus and a special announcement from an
[4953.06s -> 4955.86s]  Apex legend still to come.
[4955.86s -> 4960.18s]  Ninja presents best multiplayer game and an extended look at Ghost of Tsushima.
[4960.74s -> 4962.66s]  This is the Game Awards.
[4962.66s -> 4963.62s]  Don't go anywhere.
[4966.84s -> 4967.64s]  What is the break?
[4968.36s -> 4977.83s]  Chat, because tonight is the Game Awards.
[4977.83s -> 4978.33s]  Hold on.
[4982.82s -> 4984.66s]  You have got to be kidding me.
[4984.66s -> 4985.46s]  Is that great?
[4985.46s -> 4986.02s]  Courage?
[4986.02s -> 4986.58s]  I said no.
[4986.58s -> 4987.94s]  Come on, Harley.
[4987.94s -> 4990.18s]  We've been here training for weeks.
[4990.18s -> 4992.02s]  Don't take this the wrong way or nothing.
[4992.02s -> 4993.70s]  Okay, that's pretty good.
[4993.70s -> 4994.10s]  Hold on.
[4994.10s -> 4995.38s]  That's pretty good.
[4995.38s -> 4996.42s]  But I love you.
[5005.35s -> 5007.03s]  Wait, didn't they delete this?
[5008.25s -> 5010.49s]  I thought that Suicide Squad was what they did.
[5010.49s -> 5011.13s]  They deleted it.
[5013.80s -> 5017.10s]  Something hit someone.
[5017.74s -> 5021.59s]  Tensions like violence.
[5029.22s -> 5039.85s]  Then the very end, right when it says coming 2020, you hear, ah, where is it?
[5039.85s -> 5040.81s]  What did I just save it to?
[5054.54s -> 5056.86s]  Wait, you want to, like, see what's going on on the screen.
[5069.75s -> 5072.07s]  Over 75 awards and nominations.
[5083.13s -> 5084.41s]  Oh, this is Doom Doom.
[5085.45s -> 5094.79s]  A lot of stuff coming out in March, huh?
[5107.90s -> 5108.62s]  Ditch vape.
[5117.90s -> 5119.18s]  I'm vaping right now.
[5119.18s -> 5120.94s]  You need to cut that shit up.
[5120.94s -> 5122.14s]  Stop doing that.
[5122.14s -> 5123.74s]  I'm looking right in the eyes.
[5123.74s -> 5124.46s]  Stop doing that.
[5126.79s -> 5127.75s]  What are you doing that for?
[5129.67s -> 5130.47s]  Don't eat a banana.
[5133.05s -> 5133.85s]  Just eat a banana.
[5134.41s -> 5135.77s]  Don't do anything else.
[5135.77s -> 5136.73s]  You could eat bananas.
[5136.73s -> 5137.93s]  You could eat banana for every meal.
[5138.81s -> 5140.49s]  And then smear some peanut butter.
[5140.49s -> 5143.61s]  Spoon side up just on the roof of your mouth and swallow it.
[5143.61s -> 5144.17s]  You'll be fine.
[5145.29s -> 5154.20s]  I remember that level.
[5154.20s -> 5155.32s]  That level sucked.
[5155.32s -> 5162.31s]  Back to the game awards.
[5162.31s -> 5162.71s]  All right.
[5162.71s -> 5164.87s]  Music is a big part of games.
[5164.87s -> 5170.39s]  And Cyberpunk 2077 is one of the most anticipated games coming out next year.
[5172.39s -> 5173.43s]  You shouldn't have given me that image.
[5174.31s -> 5176.07s]  Working hard to finish the game.
[5176.07s -> 5178.39s]  But right now, we've got a behind-the-scenes look.
[5178.39s -> 5181.51s]  I have to stop talking in mute because people will literally scream at me if they...
[5182.95s -> 5189.24s]  Even in the dystopian future, hard rap lives on.
[5189.24s -> 5191.96s]  We want to provide you with the soundtrack to fucking shit up.
[5193.80s -> 5195.48s]  I mean, we're not here as refuse.
[5195.48s -> 5196.52s]  We're here as samurai.
[5196.52s -> 5198.92s]  It's a very interesting thing to be part of.
[5198.92s -> 5202.12s]  We really work on these songs, trying to make them as good as possible.
[5202.12s -> 5206.12s]  I think my music fits with my city because both are scary and pretty at the same time.
[5207.08s -> 5210.44s]  My music will be featured in Cyberpunk 2077.
[5210.44s -> 5211.40s]  I'm super excited.
[5213.00s -> 5215.96s]  It's quite rebellious and it's quite noisy and aggressive.
[5215.96s -> 5217.32s]  I think industrial is the word.
[5218.76s -> 5221.64s]  I can't wait to see how the two worlds actually meet.
[5221.64s -> 5223.80s]  I mean, it's been a lot of fun playing these beats.
[5224.36s -> 5226.52s]  It's very punk rock in a way in its approach.
[5226.52s -> 5230.20s]  They're building these systems to make really rough, edgy music.
[5230.20s -> 5234.04s]  Psychedelic, trippy, yet plifting and engaging.
[5234.52s -> 5238.68s]  And you can see a lot of kind of industrial stuff and revolution happening.
[5238.68s -> 5243.16s]  Sort of mixing punk music and like what electronic music could be in the future.
[5243.16s -> 5245.96s]  So we have some tracks that are super dirty, super heavy.
[5245.96s -> 5248.60s]  And then we have some tracks that are very beautiful and ambient.
[5249.64s -> 5252.20s]  That was just a glimpse of what we have in store for you.
[5252.20s -> 5253.08s]  See you in Night City.
[5255.08s -> 5262.50s]  I promise I won't do it again.
[5262.50s -> 5263.14s]  Oh, I gotta say it.
[5264.10s -> 5300.98s]  I'm deleting it off my OBS.
[5332.12s -> 5339.67s]  Oh, it's Cyberpunk.
[5340.63s -> 5341.69s]  Right.
[5342.57s -> 5354.18s]  Wait, you're doing the Wolverine?
[5354.18s -> 5355.62s]  Are you gonna get in and do Wolverine?
[5355.62s -> 5356.98s]  This is how Wolverine was created.
[5358.10s -> 5359.22s]  Don't do it.
[5359.22s -> 5359.70s]  Don't do it.
[5360.50s -> 5370.98s]  X.
[5373.37s -> 5375.05s]  Into the Faith Coffin.
[5378.42s -> 5380.18s]  Into the Faith Coffin.
[5384.62s -> 5386.94s]  This is the future of Cyberpunk 2020.
[5387.66s -> 5391.18s]  You put on your gamer headset and your gamer glasses and your VR
[5391.18s -> 5393.26s]  and you lie down in a fucking fake chamber.
[5394.22s -> 5400.18s]  And you have an IV of like gamer fuel and Doritos and shit.
[5400.74s -> 5410.86s]  I love it.
[5410.86s -> 5412.06s]  I'd love that.
[5412.06s -> 5413.18s]  I'd love the Vape Coffin.
[5413.98s -> 5422.76s]  And every time you sneeze, blood fucking shoots out of your nose.
[5422.76s -> 5424.20s]  And that's what it's gonna be like.
[5424.20s -> 5425.64s]  People are like, oh, the future.
[5425.64s -> 5426.60s]  It's gonna be so interesting.
[5426.60s -> 5427.40s]  No, no, no.
[5427.40s -> 5429.48s]  Every sneeze blood's gonna spray.
[5429.48s -> 5431.64s]  Blood spray out of your nose every time in the future.
[5433.00s -> 5437.85s]  Shut up.
[5437.85s -> 5439.53s]  I'm trying to hear the subcar music.
[5445.19s -> 5446.15s]  Why is he standing?
[5446.71s -> 5448.15s]  Why is he standing?
[5448.15s -> 5449.03s]  What is going on?
[5451.88s -> 5453.56s]  The camera's on me.
[5453.56s -> 5458.92s]  And now, he's the star of The Walking Dead and the best performance nominee tonight for his
[5458.92s -> 5461.64s]  role as Sam Porter Bridges in Death Stranding.
[5462.68s -> 5463.80s]  He was so torn.
[5463.80s -> 5464.76s]  He was like, do I stand?
[5464.76s -> 5465.96s]  I don't know why would I be standing?
[5465.96s -> 5466.76s]  I guess I'll stand.
[5468.36s -> 5468.86s]  Hello.
[5470.50s -> 5471.22s]  He did that thing.
[5471.22s -> 5472.10s]  He did that face.
[5472.10s -> 5472.60s]  Hi.
[5473.14s -> 5473.54s]  All right.
[5473.54s -> 5476.42s]  It's time to present the award for best action game.
[5477.14s -> 5480.18s]  These games are all wildly, wildly different.
[5480.18s -> 5485.22s]  Some new franchises, some beloved sequels, all with their own unique adversaries and
[5485.22s -> 5485.86s]  objectives.
[5486.66s -> 5491.86s]  But the one thing that they have in common is that they set the bar for lively combat
[5491.86s -> 5492.58s]  and thrills.
[5493.30s -> 5493.86s]  All right.
[5493.86s -> 5494.36s]  Ready?
[5495.38s -> 5497.05s]  All right, all right, all right.
[5497.05s -> 5497.93s]  Here's the nominees.
[5499.14s -> 5501.46s]  But that's, that's, that's like hair game.
[5501.46s -> 5502.58s]  No, those, that's hair goals.
[5502.58s -> 5502.98s]  You're right.
[5502.98s -> 5503.48s]  Keep up.
[5506.47s -> 5506.97s]  How am I doing?
[5507.83s -> 5515.53s]  Kick some ass.
[5517.37s -> 5518.97s]  Jeremy, you didn't play this game.
[5519.61s -> 5521.21s]  Yeah, you didn't play that.
[5521.21s -> 5521.71s]  All right.
[5526.73s -> 5533.19s]  This is heavy.
[5533.19s -> 5536.63s]  And the winner is Devil May Cry 5.
[5536.63s -> 5537.11s]  All right.
[5537.11s -> 5541.21s]  That's actually, that was good one.
[5541.21s -> 5543.21s]  That was, that was the best one on that list.
[5556.17s -> 5557.29s]  Boomer May Cry.
[5558.49s -> 5560.01s]  You're being snubbed.
[5560.01s -> 5561.21s]  I didn't play this game.
[5563.74s -> 5564.62s]  I didn't play the game.
[5564.62s -> 5565.34s]  I know it was good.
[5568.86s -> 5582.12s]  Thank you so much for all the fans who've been supporting us.
[5582.12s -> 5585.64s]  And thank you so much for waiting 11 years for the sequel.
[5594.02s -> 5599.78s]  I was really happy to stick with my roots and try to make as pure of an action game as possible.
[5601.96s -> 5603.00s]  Say no.
[5603.00s -> 5604.84s]  DMC is back.
[5604.84s -> 5605.34s]  Thank you.
[5610.22s -> 5613.50s]  Yeah, it's uh, I, I, I can say that again.
[5615.66s -> 5617.10s]  Congrats to DMC guys.
[5617.10s -> 5617.34s]  All right.
[5617.34s -> 5622.62s]  I'm now joined by Jeff Hadam, the studio lead and founder of two games from Canada.
[5622.62s -> 5625.82s]  I don't know how it all works out that way, but a lot of cat crimes, Canadian, Jeff.
[5625.82s -> 5626.06s]  All right.
[5626.06s -> 5628.54s]  Anyways, uh, tell us what you're working on up at two.
[5628.54s -> 5629.18s]  Thanks, Jeff.
[5629.18s -> 5631.90s]  I'm super excited to be here with the world, the air of the game.
[5631.90s -> 5633.66s]  We've been working on up in Montreal.
[5633.66s -> 5634.46s]  Salut tout le monde.
[5635.02s -> 5640.46s]  Um, when we started working on this game, we, we had the idea to put action back in action
[5640.46s -> 5647.18s]  RPG and what better place than in dungeons and dragons, forgotten realms, less action.
[5647.18s -> 5649.50s]  Am I fucking crazy together with your friends?
[5649.50s -> 5651.42s]  I want less action in my action RPGs.
[5651.42s -> 5653.02s]  Too much shit happens on this one.
[5653.02s -> 5654.14s]  Dark Alliance.
[5654.70s -> 5655.82s]  Check it out.
[5655.82s -> 5658.30s]  I don't, I don't want like a bunch of shit on the screen.
[5658.30s -> 5661.02s]  A bunch of explosions in action every second.
[5661.02s -> 5662.54s]  I like it when it's slowed down a little.
[5662.54s -> 5665.45s]  I don't want more action.
[5665.45s -> 5666.49s]  I want less action.
[5677.62s -> 5682.18s]  Why do they have the like fear factor cameras when they're in the haunted house?
[5702.68s -> 5705.00s]  I'm going to put the action back in action RPG.
[5705.00s -> 5707.64s]  We're also going to put the camera somewhere else too.
[5709.00s -> 5713.08s]  We want the, we want you to be right up in their faces, right in the action, right in their face.
[5723.56s -> 5723.88s]  All right.
[5723.88s -> 5727.16s]  Up next is the award for the absolute best.
[5729.56s -> 5733.96s]  It's the most wonderful time of the year.
[5734.76s -> 5735.00s]  Wow.
[5735.00s -> 5736.04s]  It's a little pitchy on that one.
[5736.04s -> 5736.92s]  I should keep practicing.
[5738.76s -> 5740.12s]  Looks like it's mirage.
[5740.12s -> 5740.52s]  Everybody.
[5740.52s -> 5740.84s]  What's up?
[5740.84s -> 5741.72s]  Mirage suction.
[5741.72s -> 5744.20s]  Hey, Keely, my man, what's going on?
[5744.20s -> 5746.52s]  Well, we're kind of in the middle of the game awards right now.
[5746.52s -> 5748.44s]  But this guy like attached to walls.
[5748.44s -> 5749.48s]  Oh, is that tonight?
[5749.48s -> 5750.44s]  Tell me, tell me.
[5750.44s -> 5754.60s]  Did they already win for best all around competitor in a battle royale based on skills?
[5754.60s -> 5756.04s]  But mostly good looks.
[5756.68s -> 5758.68s]  That is such a specific award.
[5758.68s -> 5762.44s]  And as I told you on Twitter, I'm sorry.
[5762.44s -> 5763.56s]  Oh, okay.
[5763.56s -> 5763.88s]  Okay.
[5763.88s -> 5764.84s]  I see what you're doing.
[5764.84s -> 5766.76s]  Keeping the mystery alive for the audience.
[5766.76s -> 5767.24s]  I get it.
[5767.24s -> 5768.60s]  It's a secret award.
[5768.60s -> 5769.40s]  I get later.
[5770.28s -> 5771.00s]  Wink.
[5771.00s -> 5773.16s]  It's not like I haven't been practicing my acceptance speech.
[5773.80s -> 5774.60s]  Wow.
[5774.60s -> 5775.56s]  These things are really heavy.
[5776.20s -> 5779.80s]  I'd like to thank my mother for my exceptional good looks.
[5779.80s -> 5781.24s]  Mirage, we have a show.
[5781.24s -> 5782.84s]  We've got lots of announcements to get to.
[5783.40s -> 5785.16s]  Is there a purpose of today's call?
[5785.16s -> 5785.72s]  Oh, right.
[5785.72s -> 5790.52s]  Well, I know everybody's always asking for more Mirage content because obviously.
[5790.52s -> 5794.20s]  And I think I speak for everyone when I say we've all had enough of crypto.
[5794.20s -> 5797.08s]  So Keely, I'm here tonight to just give the people what they want.
[5797.08s -> 5800.84s]  Oh, a decentralized way to have a mutual credit system.
[5803.00s -> 5803.96s]  I'm a captain.
[5805.56s -> 5807.64s]  The captain of what exactly?
[5807.64s -> 5810.04s]  The Mirage Voyage.
[5810.04s -> 5810.76s]  Oh, yeah.
[5810.76s -> 5813.32s]  It's my big holo day bash.
[5813.32s -> 5813.80s]  You get it?
[5813.80s -> 5817.16s]  Holo days because the and I do holograms.
[5817.16s -> 5819.32s]  And anyway, can I put you down for a plus one?
[5820.60s -> 5820.84s]  Fine.
[5822.84s -> 5823.64s]  Oh, that's the best.
[5823.64s -> 5824.28s]  What game is this?
[5824.28s -> 5827.64s]  This party starts right now.
[5834.50s -> 5835.06s]  Oh, I see.
[5835.06s -> 5836.42s]  They really they tap it into the court.
[5836.42s -> 5839.38s]  And I've got presents for everyone at the awards.
[5839.38s -> 5841.46s]  And all you beautiful people watching at home.
[5841.46s -> 5844.10s]  Join me at the party and you all get this free.
[5844.10s -> 5844.74s]  Makes sense.
[5844.74s -> 5849.06s]  Exclusive legendary skin of my matching G7.
[5849.06s -> 5849.78s]  Sexy, huh?
[5850.34s -> 5852.10s]  And the gun doesn't look bad either.
[5853.38s -> 5855.94s]  Yeah, extremely generous of you, Mirage.
[5855.94s -> 5856.42s]  Thank you for that.
[5856.42s -> 5857.78s]  What can I say, Jeff?
[5857.78s -> 5859.14s]  I am a giver.
[5859.78s -> 5860.18s]  All right.
[5860.18s -> 5861.06s]  Well, listen up.
[5861.06s -> 5864.58s]  We do have a show to get back to.
[5864.58s -> 5865.46s]  So thanks, Mirage.
[5865.46s -> 5865.94s]  OK.
[5865.94s -> 5866.66s]  OK, best buddy.
[5866.66s -> 5869.62s]  Can't wait to see you and everybody else at the biggest
[5869.62s -> 5871.62s]  celebration in the outlands.
[5871.62s -> 5872.74s]  It's party time.
[5885.38s -> 5886.98s]  This is a big holiday update.
[5891.86s -> 5897.34s]  You'll warm up in the respawn chamber quicker than you think.
[5898.06s -> 5899.82s]  I enjoy the winter months.
[5912.01s -> 5913.21s]  Is he gonna fart on him?
[5913.21s -> 5913.77s]  What was that?
[5914.41s -> 5919.51s]  What was that?
[5924.68s -> 5926.34s]  Let's do this.
[5926.90s -> 5927.62s]  Hog train?
[5932.84s -> 5934.44s]  Things called the hog train?
[5945.03s -> 5946.07s]  Why are you looking at me that way?
[5960.50s -> 5965.30s]  Up next, Dr. Bunsen, Honeydew and Beaker present games for impact.
[5965.86s -> 5966.90s]  Oh, yes.
[5966.90s -> 5968.90s]  Reggie is here and he is ready.
[5968.90s -> 5970.66s]  Oh, that's gonna be great.
[5971.46s -> 5973.54s]  We're getting a Bunsen and Beaker presentation.
[5973.54s -> 5974.50s]  The Game Awards.
[5978.33s -> 5979.93s]  We're getting a Muppets present.
[5979.93s -> 5980.49s]  All right.
[5980.49s -> 5981.53s]  I'm gonna be quiet for this one.
[5988.04s -> 5989.08s]  Is this in Fortnite?
[5990.92s -> 5992.52s]  Adding every sport to Fortnite?
[6002.23s -> 6002.87s]  Sport night.
[6003.51s -> 6016.71s]  Yeah, no, we really decided we wanted to add a full 9v9 baseball.
[6029.13s -> 6029.69s]  There you go.
[6029.69s -> 6031.85s]  Apple Arcade at the Game Awards for the first time.
[6031.85s -> 6032.89s]  Ultimate Rivals.
[6032.89s -> 6033.13s]  All right.
[6033.13s -> 6035.53s]  We have so much more show coming up.
[6035.53s -> 6039.53s]  I don't like that service because I bought it.
[6039.53s -> 6043.29s]  And there's only, okay, this is gonna sound withered and fucked up and pretentious and shitty.
[6044.57s -> 6045.85s]  I can't talk because we have...
[6046.97s -> 6076.90s]  Holy shit, they added Ori and the Blind Forest to Fortnite.
[6076.90s -> 6077.46s]  That's pretty cool.
[6078.58s -> 6080.70s]  How many players are on each map?
[6081.90s -> 6105.08s]  Play it with Xbox Game Pass.
[6107.42s -> 6111.90s]  My favorite thing about being a game designer is I didn't have to pick one subject to specialize in.
[6113.66s -> 6119.66s]  I'm able to just follow my interests and spend lots of time studying galactic evolution
[6120.14s -> 6123.34s]  or urban planning or psychology, whatever it is.
[6124.78s -> 6127.66s]  And then I just kind of turn that into a toy, into a game.
[6127.66s -> 6131.34s]  Part of my job is just enjoying exploring the world
[6131.34s -> 6133.74s]  and letting my interest take me wherever they go.
[6133.74s -> 6135.90s]  And there are not too many jobs that I think let you do that.
[6136.94s -> 6138.86s]  This is like a...
[6141.02s -> 6142.54s]  When it comes to upping your competition...
[6142.54s -> 6143.90s]  This is a Gary Larson comic.
[6143.90s -> 6146.86s]  Warframes per second makes a measurable difference.
[6146.86s -> 6147.50s]  Trust me.
[6147.50s -> 6151.98s]  That's why Samsung's latest QLED TVs feature native support for games,
[6151.98s -> 6156.38s]  running it up to 120 frames per second with very low input lag
[6156.38s -> 6159.66s]  and this sweet auto game mode that detects when you're gaming
[6159.66s -> 6162.46s]  and turns off any extra image processing.
[6162.46s -> 6166.62s]  They've even got AMD FreeSync for smoother animations when the frame rate dips.
[6166.62s -> 6167.82s]  Edit it onto the screen.
[6170.63s -> 6173.67s]  The war had just started when I arrived to Iraq.
[6173.67s -> 6174.47s]  We did our thing.
[6175.03s -> 6176.55s]  We had some experiences.
[6176.55s -> 6178.79s]  And when we came back, when we got off that plane,
[6179.59s -> 6181.67s]  before we can even embrace our loved ones,
[6182.55s -> 6183.83s]  our fire team leader says,
[6183.83s -> 6185.83s]  do not tell anybody what happened to you
[6186.47s -> 6189.11s]  or what you saw or what you experienced.
[6189.91s -> 6193.59s]  That starts the stigma of mental health.
[6195.27s -> 6199.67s]  StackUp is a military charity supporting US and allied veterans' mental health and gaming.
[6200.31s -> 6204.47s]  Overwatch is our newest program and it is simply having a chat client up.
[6204.47s -> 6208.79s]  Somebody comes in and says they need to talk or they're interested to get into a game.
[6208.79s -> 6210.23s]  We have somebody available for them.
[6212.63s -> 6217.99s]  They may not want to come out there and see a counselor for an hour once a week,
[6217.99s -> 6220.47s]  but they may come out there and play a video game
[6220.47s -> 6223.59s]  and start talking about their experiences of war
[6223.59s -> 6226.07s]  or the struggles that they're having right now.
[6226.87s -> 6230.31s]  It has become my passion to end the stigma of mental health.
[6231.27s -> 6240.39s]  Please welcome two of the most innovative visionaries in the history of gaming.
[6240.39s -> 6241.27s]  I can't wait to see this one.
[6241.27s -> 6243.11s]  And just about everything else.
[6243.11s -> 6246.71s]  From Muppet Labs, Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and Beaker.
[6247.83s -> 6248.55s]  How are we?
[6248.55s -> 6250.39s]  Oh, we are eight on each other's TVs.
[6250.39s -> 6251.19s]  Thank you.
[6251.19s -> 6253.43s]  Greetings, fellow gaming enthusiasts.
[6253.43s -> 6256.23s]  It's great to be here at the Game Awards.
[6256.23s -> 6259.75s]  I am Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and this is my assistant Beaker.
[6261.27s -> 6262.87s]  Beaky, where did you go?
[6264.01s -> 6267.53s]  Oh, I guess he's stuck in the lobby.
[6270.09s -> 6270.49s]  Nothing?
[6272.49s -> 6276.81s]  In just a few moments, we will reveal the winner of Games for Impact.
[6276.81s -> 6278.65s]  But first, I was hoping to...
[6278.65s -> 6280.25s]  Oh, here's Beaky now.
[6280.25s -> 6281.13s]  He's in VR.
[6282.25s -> 6282.97s]  Good to see you.
[6285.05s -> 6287.35s]  I forgot we have a basement.
[6288.71s -> 6291.99s]  Beaky, I'm so glad you're here wearing VR goggles
[6291.99s -> 6294.15s]  to demonstrate our brand new game.
[6295.99s -> 6300.71s]  Yes, as you can see, Beaker is wearing Muppet Labs proprietary
[6300.71s -> 6304.95s]  next generation technology, VR super gluey goggles.
[6305.75s -> 6308.63s]  You can put them on, but you can't get them off.
[6314.30s -> 6318.14s]  And now we will premiere the exciting new Muppet Labs game.
[6318.14s -> 6320.62s]  Oh, Beaker, that's not funny.
[6320.62s -> 6321.42s]  That's terrifying.
[6322.22s -> 6323.02s]  What are we calling it?
[6323.98s -> 6330.28s]  Of course, the Untitled Beaker game.
[6331.88s -> 6333.00s]  Excellent choice.
[6333.00s -> 6334.04s]  Let the game begin.
[6349.00s -> 6349.64s]  Let's play this.
[6371.30s -> 6372.66s]  Where does Norman Reed us off the thing?
[6378.02s -> 6380.42s]  Here are the nominees for Games for Impact,
[6380.42s -> 6384.58s]  recognizing socially conscious and progressive games in the industry.
[6385.30s -> 6386.34s]  Roll the nominees.
[6386.66s -> 6387.86s]  Games for Impact.
[6389.86s -> 6393.18s]  Me to hate this whole town.
[6394.30s -> 6412.34s]  Why is it so dark?
[6414.34s -> 6416.70s]  I find Life is Strange.
[6416.70s -> 6418.70s]  Life is Strange 2 has like magic in it.
[6418.70s -> 6420.30s]  And the winner is...
[6420.30s -> 6421.10s]  Wait, that's it, don't...
[6423.10s -> 6425.06s]  What are you doing outside the game?
[6426.10s -> 6428.50s]  You just please, hey, hey, give that back to me.
[6428.50s -> 6430.26s]  Beaker, get him, get him, Beaker.
[6431.30s -> 6433.46s]  Oh, no, that's me, that's me, Beaker.
[6434.42s -> 6435.30s]  Where did he go?
[6435.30s -> 6436.26s]  Where did he go?
[6436.26s -> 6436.82s]  Where did he go?
[6437.78s -> 6438.34s]  Where is he?
[6438.90s -> 6439.94s]  Get him, he's behind you.
[6444.55s -> 6445.05s]  There.
[6445.99s -> 6447.03s]  You've got him under control?
[6447.91s -> 6448.79s]  All right.
[6448.79s -> 6449.59s]  Okay, okay.
[6450.31s -> 6451.03s]  Thank you, Beaker.
[6453.50s -> 6454.86s]  I don't care if I'm a two-year-old.
[6454.86s -> 6455.82s]  This is cute.
[6455.82s -> 6456.70s]  Hold his beak sharp.
[6457.66s -> 6459.18s]  Hold his beak, Beaker, that's it.
[6459.18s -> 6460.30s]  Get him, get him.
[6460.30s -> 6460.80s]  Good.
[6461.66s -> 6462.70s]  Sorry about that, folks.
[6463.42s -> 6465.26s]  The award for Games for...
[6468.26s -> 6468.98s]  Would you...
[6468.98s -> 6470.28s]  Have you got it?
[6470.28s -> 6471.64s]  Fight his nose, fight his nose.
[6472.68s -> 6473.40s]  Fight his nose.
[6475.05s -> 6475.55s]  Stop it.
[6476.84s -> 6477.34s]  All right.
[6478.94s -> 6481.90s]  The award for Games for Impact goes to...
[6483.56s -> 6484.60s]  No, not...
[6484.60s -> 6485.10s]  He's...
[6486.04s -> 6486.54s]  Breeze.
[6488.76s -> 6496.52s]  I really wanted this, really.
[6496.52s -> 6500.12s]  I wanted to start fighting Beaker's like, neck and face and shit.
[6501.08s -> 6505.72s]  I hope...
[6506.74s -> 6507.46s]  Wonderful.
[6507.46s -> 6509.14s]  It's gonna honk, thank you, it's gonna honk.
[6509.14s -> 6510.02s]  Thank you to the Muppets.
[6514.49s -> 6519.93s]  I shared this award with, first of all, Conrad, our creative director,
[6519.93s -> 6521.77s]  with all the team back at home.
[6521.77s -> 6524.89s]  We made a really good team and we could have never made it without them.
[6524.89s -> 6528.41s]  We have to thank Devolver for allowing us to do the game we wanted to make.
[6530.01s -> 6532.01s]  Yes, well, first of all, I mean, I would like to thank,
[6532.01s -> 6535.05s]  especially to all those people that share their stories with us.
[6535.05s -> 6538.57s]  They send really, really moving stories when they were playing Greece.
[6538.57s -> 6540.49s]  That's something that, obviously, when you create a game,
[6540.49s -> 6544.01s]  you try to do these kind of things, but you never know if you're gonna get to someone.
[6544.01s -> 6547.85s]  And we, pretty much, are so moved when we receive this story.
[6547.85s -> 6550.49s]  So, please keep sharing it with us because it's amazing.
[6550.49s -> 6552.33s]  And thank you, everybody, that play and support Breeze.
[6552.33s -> 6552.97s]  Thank you very much.
[6564.46s -> 6565.98s]  Thanks to Bunsen and Beaker.
[6565.98s -> 6568.14s]  Lifelong dream to have them here at the show.
[6568.14s -> 6568.78s]  That was a good bit.
[6569.50s -> 6569.90s]  I like that.
[6569.90s -> 6571.82s]  I also want to mention something called the Game Festival.
[6571.82s -> 6573.02s]  I don't know if you heard about that online,
[6573.02s -> 6575.58s]  but we're launching a new thing tied to the game where it's called the Game Festival.
[6575.58s -> 6579.34s]  And the vision for that is to give all of you around the world who watch the show,
[6579.42s -> 6582.54s]  you watch trailers, you love games, a chance to play a bunch of games.
[6582.54s -> 6584.54s]  And this year, we're partnering with Steam.
[6584.54s -> 6586.62s]  And if you head to Steam for the next 48 hours,
[6586.62s -> 6588.30s]  a little bit less than that since it started this morning,
[6588.30s -> 6593.50s]  we have first look demos of over a dozen upcoming games that you can play for free on Steam.
[6593.50s -> 6595.34s]  And I think that's kind of the future where this all goes.
[6595.34s -> 6596.06s]  Bringing demos back?
[6596.06s -> 6598.94s]  Not necessarily these local events where you have to travel somewhere to play a game,
[6598.94s -> 6604.22s]  but actually bringing games into your homes and the places you work and live to play.
[6604.22s -> 6605.50s]  So, play all those games.
[6605.50s -> 6608.54s]  The Game Festival concludes Saturday at 10 a.m. Pacific.
[6608.54s -> 6610.06s]  And next year, we're going to do it across all the platforms.
[6610.06s -> 6611.34s]  I don't know why they went away in the first place.
[6611.34s -> 6611.90s]  A big thing.
[6611.90s -> 6613.42s]  So, we're looking forward to doing more with that.
[6614.14s -> 6614.38s]  All right.
[6614.38s -> 6616.86s]  Well, now we're going to present some more awards.
[6616.86s -> 6619.34s]  And let's get into the best family game.
[6619.34s -> 6622.94s]  The nominees for that category are Luigi's Mansion 3,
[6623.98s -> 6628.22s]  Ring Fit Adventure, Super Mario Maker 2, Super Smash Brothers Ultimate.
[6628.22s -> 6629.82s]  They're all Nintendo games.
[6630.46s -> 6632.94s]  And Yoshi's Crafted World.
[6632.94s -> 6634.62s]  It's just best Nintendo game.
[6634.62s -> 6635.90s]  Kind of like Nintendo's chances in this category.
[6636.86s -> 6640.78s]  And the game award goes to Luigi's Mansion 3.
[6640.78s -> 6642.06s]  Why even have this category?
[6642.78s -> 6647.74s]  Why don't you just have an ad up here that just says buy Nintendo games for families?
[6656.46s -> 6657.10s]  Just have a Nintendo ad.
[6661.10s -> 6661.74s]  Have to close my eyes.
[6662.54s -> 6668.06s]  And the game award goes to FIFA 1 Crash Team Racing Nitrofuel.
[6669.02s -> 6677.13s]  And for the best mobile game, the nominees are Call of Duty Mobile, Grindstone,
[6677.13s -> 6683.05s]  Sayonara Wild Hearts, which we announced last year, Sky, Children of the Light, and What the Golf.
[6683.69s -> 6688.33s]  And the game award in that category goes to Call of Duty Mobile.
[6688.33s -> 6689.45s]  Congratulations, guys.
[6691.53s -> 6692.09s]  All right.
[6692.17s -> 6696.65s]  Well, now I'd like to welcome the co-creators of Dishonored and Prey.
[6696.65s -> 6697.85s]  Raph and Julian are here.
[6697.85s -> 6701.05s]  You may have seen online that they've just announced their brand new studio.
[6701.05s -> 6702.89s]  Wolfi and Seth here at the Game Awards.
[6702.89s -> 6705.13s]  They're going to reveal their first game.
[6705.13s -> 6706.65s]  So guys, welcome to the Game Awards.
[6706.65s -> 6708.81s]  You've been here before, but you've got this new studio.
[6708.81s -> 6710.81s]  So tell me a bit about Wolfi.
[6710.81s -> 6711.77s]  What's different about it?
[6711.77s -> 6716.33s]  So, well, we took a long break, but it looks like we can't stay away from making a game for very long.
[6716.33s -> 6718.01s]  So we're just back at it now with Wolfi.
[6718.65s -> 6719.21s]  Yeah.
[6719.21s -> 6720.89s]  Well, what can you tell us about the game?
[6720.89s -> 6721.61s]  We know the studio.
[6721.61s -> 6723.69s]  We don't know anything about the game, but that's going to change now, right?
[6723.69s -> 6724.09s]  Yeah.
[6724.09s -> 6728.09s]  So you've mentioned Dishonored and Prey as some of our past games.
[6728.89s -> 6732.41s]  We have passion for interesting worlds to explore.
[6732.97s -> 6735.37s]  We have passion for depth of interactivity.
[6736.01s -> 6738.73s]  And of course, we have passion for simulation in general.
[6738.73s -> 6741.37s]  So this new game has all of these values.
[6741.37s -> 6743.77s]  But this time, we have a bit of a different approach.
[6744.81s -> 6748.81s]  We brought a glimpse to show you through a teaser.
[6748.81s -> 6749.93s]  I'm pretending.
[6749.93s -> 6750.81s]  It's amazing.
[6750.81s -> 6752.33s]  One of my favorite programs to show tonight.
[6752.33s -> 6753.37s]  That was pretty incredible.
[6753.37s -> 6755.21s]  You're going to see the real game here, guys.
[6755.21s -> 6756.41s]  We can't wait to hear more about this.
[6756.41s -> 6757.29s]  Let's take a look.
[6757.29s -> 6757.85s]  What do you do?
[6757.85s -> 6759.37s]  First look at the first project.
[6759.37s -> 6759.85s]  Nice.
[6760.97s -> 6761.61s]  I was pretending.
[6761.61s -> 6762.65s]  That was, you can call me out on that.
[6764.01s -> 6776.07s]  The West, the land of opportunity.
[6777.85s -> 6784.73s]  A place where you can be a hero, a scoundrel, and anything in between.
[6786.95s -> 6789.43s]  This ain't quite the Wild West as you know it.
[6790.73s -> 6793.29s]  There are ancient powers that war with each other.
[6794.17s -> 6798.65s]  Strange entities lurking in the dead of night with their own rules
[6798.65s -> 6801.05s]  and their own peculiar motives.
[6803.21s -> 6805.37s]  Welcome to the weird West.
[6807.13s -> 6808.25s]  Weird West.
[6819.08s -> 6819.96s]  Wacky West.
[6820.92s -> 6838.52s]  All right, action.
[6838.52s -> 6839.16s]  Action RPG.
[6839.16s -> 6842.20s]  The only out here could be the best thing that ever happened to you.
[6843.00s -> 6845.08s]  If you can survive, that is.
[6847.08s -> 6848.92s]  What's with the on the phone late at night?
[6849.88s -> 6851.08s]  Talking that that was.
[6851.08s -> 6856.36s]  All right, up next, a brand new MMO action RPG game from a legendary franchise.
[6856.36s -> 6857.32s]  Check out this announcement.
[6880.23s -> 6896.55s]  Firefists.
[6898.71s -> 6899.69s]  Spiders.
[6901.10s -> 6901.66s]  What else?
[6902.94s -> 6920.92s]  Magic Legends.
[6924.47s -> 6926.23s]  Magic, Firefox?
[6926.95s -> 6927.59s]  What was that?
[6927.59s -> 6928.55s]  Magic Legends.
[6928.55s -> 6933.11s]  Coming up, the first look at a brand new game from an exciting new studio.
[6933.11s -> 6936.71s]  And Ninja is here to hand out the award for best multiplayer game.
[6937.35s -> 6941.27s]  And still to come, more premieres, more awards,
[6941.27s -> 6947.03s]  an extended preview from Ghost of Tsushima and Green Day performs live.
[6947.03s -> 6949.19s]  The game awards will be right back.
[6949.19s -> 6950.55s]  I want the Muppets to come back.
[6951.35s -> 6954.39s]  Can the Muppets just present every award?
[6955.83s -> 6960.49s]  Hi, I'm looking for...
[6960.49s -> 6961.05s]  Stadia?
[6962.34s -> 6962.74s]  What?
[6962.74s -> 6963.54s]  What's Stadia?
[6964.26s -> 6969.46s]  Stadia is only the newest, most logic-defined, mind-bending, absurd gaming platform on Earth.
[6969.46s -> 6973.54s]  I'll take conversations that will never happen for 100 plays.
[6975.54s -> 6978.98s]  And this electric air is Stadia.
[6979.86s -> 6982.74s]  Unlike console, Stadia doesn't take up any space.
[6984.34s -> 6985.91s]  It makes no noise.
[6985.91s -> 6987.19s]  It has no smell.
[6987.19s -> 6987.75s]  Watch.
[6987.75s -> 6988.87s]  Go find Stadia, boy.
[6989.59s -> 6990.07s]  Don't worry.
[6990.79s -> 6992.71s]  You'll never find it.
[6992.71s -> 6993.27s]  Okay.
[6993.27s -> 6995.27s]  You can play Stadia with this.
[7000.55s -> 7004.34s]  What games are on there?
[7005.70s -> 7010.01s]  With Stadia, you can go virtually anywhere.
[7011.05s -> 7016.65s]  Unless you want to play Tomb Raider or NBA 2K18.
[7016.65s -> 7019.93s]  Stadia is gaming for free-range humans.
[7020.89s -> 7022.89s]  Stadia travels across screens.
[7024.65s -> 7026.04s]  No downloads.
[7026.04s -> 7027.00s]  No updates.
[7027.00s -> 7027.72s]  No waiting.
[7027.72s -> 7030.68s]  Stadia bends time and space to take you straight to your game.
[7030.68s -> 7033.72s]  So, Stadia is the platform.
[7033.72s -> 7035.88s]  Technically, this is Stadia.
[7035.88s -> 7039.00s]  Stadia's streaming pipeline leverages decades of Google research.
[7039.00s -> 7039.56s]  Is that a dog?
[7042.46s -> 7043.66s]  He actually found it.
[7046.38s -> 7048.38s]  But so does every other platform.
[7048.38s -> 7049.58s]  It doesn't matter.
[7049.58s -> 7053.10s]  As I don't get, Stadia has the games you're looking for.
[7053.10s -> 7054.14s]  So does PlayStation 4.
[7054.14s -> 7056.22s]  So does PlayStation 5, Xbox, PC.
[7058.54s -> 7063.42s]  I can download a game on Switch and it won't have like 0.4 seconds of input delay.
[7064.30s -> 7066.30s]  I don't understand why this is here.
[7066.30s -> 7070.54s]  And I actually have a theory that the Stadia, they know that it's not good enough.
[7071.34s -> 7076.62s]  But in 10 years, maybe the internet will get to a point where they'll be the first movers
[7076.62s -> 7078.22s]  when everything is like 7G.
[7078.22s -> 7078.94s]  They'll be here.
[7084.06s -> 7085.42s]  That's a 10-year play.
[7085.42s -> 7086.14s]  But I don't like that.
[7103.18s -> 7104.14s]  PUBG Mobile?
[7113.10s -> 7118.30s]  Why not just PUBG?
[7118.30s -> 7120.14s]  PUBG Mobile only.
[7130.78s -> 7131.90s]  Fight for the Amazon.
[7144.17s -> 7147.21s]  Oh, by the way, I played Luigi's Mansion for like an hour or two.
[7147.21s -> 7148.65s]  I could never play that game for more.
[7148.65s -> 7149.21s]  I can't do it.
[7149.21s -> 7150.17s]  I can't play it.
[7150.17s -> 7152.17s]  I will never play Luigi's Mansion for more.
[7152.97s -> 7154.25s]  And I really don't talk about this.
[7154.25s -> 7155.29s]  I'll try to go as quick as I can.
[7157.85s -> 7160.04s]  Luigi's Mansion 3.
[7161.24s -> 7162.84s]  The vacuum cleaner mechanic.
[7162.84s -> 7164.44s]  I have to suck up everything.
[7164.44s -> 7168.36s]  I cannot leave a single room unless every single fucking object is in that vacuum.
[7169.24s -> 7170.20s]  I can't play the game.
[7177.21s -> 7178.17s]  It takes me hours.
[7178.89s -> 7180.41s]  I played the game for probably two and a half hours.
[7181.45s -> 7183.53s]  And I got through maybe the first five rooms.
[7188.17s -> 7190.65s]  Fitness or just taking control of their health in general.
[7190.65s -> 7193.21s]  And if one of your goals is to quit vaping,
[7193.21s -> 7194.57s]  Truth has a program that can help.
[7194.57s -> 7195.93s]  It's called This Is Quitting.
[7195.93s -> 7200.17s]  It's free, anonymous, text-based, available any time of day right on your phone.
[7200.17s -> 7202.09s]  And it's already helping as thousands of people quit.
[7202.09s -> 7204.65s]  All you have to do is text DITCHJUEL to 888-799.
[7204.65s -> 7205.85s]  And then it texts you.
[7205.85s -> 7207.53s]  It texts you to stop.
[7207.53s -> 7208.97s]  But you don't have to do it alone.
[7208.97s -> 7211.67s]  Visit the Truth information and enjoy the game of words.
[7218.33s -> 7219.13s]  Vape coffin.
[7219.13s -> 7222.33s]  All right, now here's a brand new game announcement from Oculus Studios.
[7222.33s -> 7222.81s]  Check it out.
[7224.17s -> 7225.93s]  Hey, it's Jeremy here with the vape coffin.
[7254.36s -> 7257.32s]  I feel like the bar fighting game was like a better version of that somehow.
[7257.32s -> 7259.64s]  ...is one of the most watched streamers alive
[7259.64s -> 7263.40s]  and the winner of last year's game award for content creator of the year.
[7263.40s -> 7265.11s]  Please welcome Ninja.
[7267.58s -> 7268.22s]  What's this for?
[7268.78s -> 7269.34s]  What's this for?
[7272.46s -> 7274.54s]  Thank you guys so much for obviously being here.
[7274.54s -> 7276.62s]  I've been playing video games my entire life.
[7277.26s -> 7279.98s]  And there's something magical about a solo player experience.
[7280.62s -> 7281.98s]  And the only way to enhance that
[7282.62s -> 7284.14s]  is to play games with your friends.
[7285.10s -> 7288.86s]  I've literally defined my entire career by playing online multiplayer games.
[7289.50s -> 7292.22s]  And here are the nominees for the best multiplayer game of the year.
[7318.81s -> 7322.50s]  If you did like the Coke and Pepsi test with me
[7322.50s -> 7324.58s]  and you put me in half of those games on this list,
[7325.46s -> 7326.98s]  blindfold and just put me in.
[7326.98s -> 7329.06s]  I don't know if I'd be able to tell you what one I was playing.
[7329.06s -> 7331.70s]  The game award for best multiplayer game goes to
[7332.74s -> 7335.69s]  it's a lot more difficult to open up than you think.
[7337.64s -> 7338.52s]  Apex Legends.
[7341.35s -> 7341.91s]  Tetris.
[7342.63s -> 7343.51s]  All right, blindfold me.
[7343.51s -> 7344.47s]  Let's see.
[7344.47s -> 7345.11s]  I don't know.
[7345.11s -> 7347.03s]  I could be in a this is like a VR.
[7348.15s -> 7356.68s]  Tetris lost.
[7359.59s -> 7360.47s]  Wow.
[7360.47s -> 7362.55s]  But Tetris is also like 60 years old.
[7362.55s -> 7365.03s]  The last four years has been transformative for Respawn.
[7365.67s -> 7367.83s]  They didn't have game awards when Tetris came out.
[7367.83s -> 7369.19s]  That's the real sad part.
[7369.19s -> 7371.83s]  They should do a retroactive game award.
[7371.83s -> 7373.11s]  Thank you to the fans.
[7373.11s -> 7373.99s]  Thank you so much.
[7375.35s -> 7380.26s]  I'd just like to thank the team at Respawn of crazy, passionate,
[7380.26s -> 7384.18s]  super talented individuals for going with us on this crazy journey.
[7384.18s -> 7385.54s]  We changed our genre.
[7385.54s -> 7386.82s]  We changed our business model.
[7386.82s -> 7389.86s]  We made our first character based game and we changed IPs
[7389.86s -> 7391.94s]  while we were shipping a AAA shooter.
[7391.94s -> 7393.06s]  So thank you.
[7393.06s -> 7393.94s]  I love you guys.
[7406.02s -> 7407.78s]  At the end of that, all he had to do was go like this.
[7407.78s -> 7409.30s]  Congratulations to Respawn.
[7409.94s -> 7412.82s]  Great to see Apex winning best multiplayer game now.
[7412.82s -> 7415.54s]  This year, TikTok has swept the nation with its hashtag challenges.
[7415.54s -> 7416.10s]  No, no, no.
[7416.10s -> 7419.22s]  The past few weeks, fans have been celebrating gaming on TikTok
[7419.22s -> 7423.70s]  with over 450 million views so far.
[7423.70s -> 7427.22s]  Tonight, you can use the hashtag to join the celebration of gaming
[7427.22s -> 7429.62s]  and esports biggest night in the contest.
[7429.62s -> 7431.06s]  Cheesy C64.
[7431.06s -> 7432.90s]  He's the guy that wanted right there.
[7432.90s -> 7434.58s]  So congratulations to him.
[7434.58s -> 7435.38s]  All right.
[7435.38s -> 7437.62s]  We've got so much more game awards coming up.
[7437.70s -> 7440.10s]  The gaming on TikTok contest will continue for the next few days.
[7440.10s -> 7441.30s]  Cheesy C64.
[7441.30s -> 7444.34s]  The next Twitch poll is open for best ongoing game.
[7444.34s -> 7447.14s]  You can go vote now and we'll see who you think is going to take home
[7447.14s -> 7449.22s]  the game award in just a bit.
[7449.22s -> 7453.46s]  But right now, let's talk about a big PlayStation 4 title
[7453.46s -> 7456.42s]  that's coming next year from the guys at Sucker Punch.
[7457.06s -> 7458.34s]  Ghost of Tsushima.
[7458.34s -> 7460.26s]  You probably saw this teased earlier this week.
[7460.26s -> 7464.02s]  I am so excited about this game and what Sucker Punch is bringing to life.
[7464.02s -> 7466.42s]  We have our longest world premiere on the show tonight,
[7466.42s -> 7469.70s]  as I've been saying, a true cinematic look in joy.
[7469.70s -> 7471.94s]  Why is it not coming out in the PS5?
[7471.94s -> 7473.46s]  Why is it not coming out in the PS5?
[7479.27s -> 7481.51s]  It's been developing for like seven years, guys.
[7539.80s -> 7562.90s]  That was a really powerful...
[7568.10s -> 7568.66s]  Some say.
[7570.74s -> 7579.88s]  Others say he is a storm made flesh.
[7581.96s -> 7589.02s]  When the wind freshens their tents and boats, they know he is coming.
[7610.68s -> 7616.41s]  Okay, as a weapons expert, half of this stuff is not even possible.
[7624.71s -> 7665.74s]  Are we getting Final Fantasy VII here?
[7665.74s -> 7666.70s]  I feel like I've seen this.
[7667.90s -> 7690.07s]  The leaves are...
[7690.07s -> 7691.35s]  Oh, that's a bad idea.
[7691.35s -> 7693.83s]  The leaves are gonna stop blowing around and like hitting people in the face.
[7694.47s -> 7696.07s]  People are gonna find him in their hair.
[7701.78s -> 7705.14s]  Right now somebody has a big like 7-up.
[7705.14s -> 7706.26s]  No, 7-11.
[7706.26s -> 7709.06s]  A big 7-11 big gulp and one's gonna fall right in it.
[7709.94s -> 7711.58s]  It could be 7-up in there.
[7712.30s -> 7735.98s]  Imagine drinking a big gulp at the VGAs.
[7737.93s -> 7739.05s]  What's so wrong with that?
[7739.85s -> 7742.76s]  Guys, I got news for you.
[7742.76s -> 7745.08s]  If I ever go to the VGAs, I'm going like this.
[7745.64s -> 7749.16s]  And I'm gonna have a fucking like 47 ounce big gulp.
[7753.38s -> 7755.62s]  And I'm gonna have big sunglasses on.
[7755.62s -> 7757.30s]  Like I just got out of the eye doctor.
[7757.30s -> 7758.82s]  And I'm gonna be sitting there like...
[7758.82s -> 7759.94s]  The Game Awards Orchestra.
[7759.94s -> 7762.10s]  Let's give it up for our incredible conductor tonight.
[7762.10s -> 7763.94s]  Max Arouge, the Game Awards Orchestra.
[7766.57s -> 7772.09s]  They'll be back later for an incredible montage celebrating our Game of the Year nominees.
[7772.09s -> 7774.49s]  And Game of the Year will be presented by some very special guests.
[7774.49s -> 7775.05s]  Are you sleeping?
[7775.05s -> 7775.53s]  Surprise guests.
[7775.53s -> 7776.73s]  So stay tuned for that.
[7776.73s -> 7779.13s]  No, just like go cool.
[7779.13s -> 7780.97s]  A look at Gears Tactics.
[7780.97s -> 7781.45s]  Check it out.
[7788.70s -> 7792.22s]  The game for us invaded every part of our world.
[7793.80s -> 7795.96s]  So we did the only thing we could.
[7795.96s -> 7799.37s]  We set the world on fire.
[7802.49s -> 7808.58s]  The war begins against the monster that created these monsters.
[7808.58s -> 7810.02s]  Come in the beast.
[7810.02s -> 7811.38s]  The mon- the mon- the monstars.
[7811.38s -> 7812.34s]  That's the monstars.
[7812.98s -> 7814.90s]  And it's time to go hunting.
[7814.90s -> 7815.94s]  I thought that was them.
[7817.06s -> 7820.60s]  Oh, gentlemen, get shitheads.
[7827.42s -> 7835.10s]  My newest creation thinks of your little plan.
[7835.10s -> 7840.52s]  It's a long ass time.
[7857.14s -> 7860.82s]  Just once I want a game company to just blatantly fall on.
[7860.82s -> 7864.50s]  Fucking lie in their text as much as they lie in their gameplay footage.
[7867.67s -> 7869.27s]  600 hour long campaign.
[7870.15s -> 7882.41s]  Let's turn back to Twitch.
[7882.41s -> 7886.57s]  We asked Twitch to predict the winner for the best ongoing game category.
[7886.57s -> 7889.13s]  And they chose Final Fantasy XIV.
[7889.13s -> 7892.17s]  We will find out when we present that award in a little bit.
[7892.17s -> 7894.97s]  That's not a- that's only 27%.
[7894.97s -> 7896.89s]  That must have been close.
[7896.89s -> 7900.17s]  A performance that's going to rock the house by Green Day.
[7901.37s -> 7905.53s]  The award for best game direction and of course, game of the year.
[7905.53s -> 7909.61s]  Right now, here's a world premiere of a brand new game from a team in China.
[7909.61s -> 7913.69s]  It's a multiplayer melee combat game that you're seeing for the first time.
[7913.69s -> 7915.69s]  Multiplayer melee combat game.
[7919.85s -> 7920.97s]  I feel like that's every game.
[7945.00s -> 7947.08s]  All footage captured at Gary's house.
[7947.96s -> 7975.99s]  Or all footage will be deleted.
[7980.94s -> 7985.10s]  Or do not re-upload this copyright, you know, anything like that.
[8008.84s -> 8010.20s]  Welcome to Magic School.
[8011.00s -> 8015.08s]  Now that we've covered flying, let's talk about giant angels.
[8015.96s -> 8018.60s]  Not to be confused with bird people.
[8018.60s -> 8020.04s]  Bird people are their own thing.
[8020.76s -> 8022.60s]  Play Magic the Gathering with me.
[8022.60s -> 8023.40s]  Download free.
[8024.04s -> 8024.36s]  Free?
[8026.01s -> 8027.45s]  A masterpiece.
[8027.45s -> 8030.97s]  How many years have I waited for this moment?
[8030.97s -> 8032.95s]  Walmart of excellence.
[8032.95s -> 8035.83s]  For the one that stood alone against the storm.
[8036.71s -> 8045.03s]  For the one they of light.
[8045.03s -> 8050.38s]  Is this the one that won?
[8051.58s -> 8060.22s]  This tragedy, greater even than the Seventh Umbral Calamity, must be undone.
[8061.50s -> 8063.50s]  I- I- I- I know people- I'm late.
[8063.50s -> 8064.30s]  This tree must be-
[8064.30s -> 8065.42s]  I don't- whatever, I'm just gonna say it.
[8066.46s -> 8068.38s]  Just drop the numbers from Final Fantasy.
[8068.38s -> 8069.82s]  It's getting so fucking confusing.
[8070.78s -> 8071.90s]  Just drop the numbers.
[8071.90s -> 8073.10s]  It was- Final Fantasy VIII.
[8073.10s -> 8073.82s]  It's not coming up.
[8073.82s -> 8074.54s]  Just drop the numbers.
[8075.90s -> 8077.42s]  Just start doing colons.
[8078.70s -> 8084.22s]  Final Fantasy XIX, X1V2214.
[8084.22s -> 8086.54s]  Just- just start making up other fucking titles.
[8087.42s -> 8093.21s]  I made this tweet, like, five years ago.
[8093.21s -> 8096.89s]  But, like, eat- like, when you have more numbers than the Jason movies.
[8097.45s -> 8099.64s]  Like, it's time to change it.
[8099.64s -> 8103.40s]  My game's called Let's Be Well and it's made with the Roblox Studio game engine.
[8104.04s -> 8106.44s]  It starts off all grey.
[8106.44s -> 8108.76s]  This guy, it says he's depressed.
[8109.40s -> 8113.08s]  As he plays the obstacle course, he learns about the depression.
[8113.08s -> 8116.60s]  So this is to get people talking so they don't bottle their feelings up.
[8117.72s -> 8126.57s]  I was pregnant with our youngest son and my late husband got very, very sick.
[8127.21s -> 8129.77s]  The doctors call it a major depressive episode.
[8129.77s -> 8132.89s]  His mental illness overtook him by way of suicide.
[8132.89s -> 8135.93s]  And so we lost him when Luke was two years old at the time.
[8136.49s -> 8139.14s]  It's kind of hard to explain.
[8139.14s -> 8141.86s]  Like, how my dad died when I was very young.
[8141.86s -> 8147.70s]  I just wanted to spread a positive message that it's okay to talk about mental illness.
[8147.70s -> 8149.14s]  I hope I've helped people.
[8156.52s -> 8159.80s]  Now, she's a host and producer for IGN.
[8159.80s -> 8161.72s]  Please welcome Sydney Goodman.
[8166.42s -> 8172.41s]  To present the award for best ongoing game.
[8172.41s -> 8173.13s]  Recognizing that-
[8173.13s -> 8173.77s]  Final Fantasy.
[8174.33s -> 8175.53s]  Final Fantasy.
[8175.53s -> 8181.13s]  Year after year and acknowledging the teams that keep these massively popular franchises
[8181.13s -> 8185.61s]  fresh with new content, more experiences and evolving ways to play.
[8186.33s -> 8187.61s]  Here are the nominees.
[8188.25s -> 8189.45s]  I thought we just did this.
[8189.45s -> 8190.81s]  Best ongoing game.
[8198.78s -> 8201.10s]  I feel like we're seeing the same category.
[8202.38s -> 8211.85s]  Destiny 2, Fortnite Call of Duty.
[8212.25s -> 8213.69s]  Am I going nuts?
[8214.49s -> 8217.85s]  And the game award for best ongoing game goes to...
[8220.02s -> 8220.82s]  Fortnite.
[8220.82s -> 8222.57s]  You don't know.
[8222.57s -> 8224.89s]  She was just immediately like, you don't know.
[8225.85s -> 8226.57s]  I know.
[8227.53s -> 8228.49s]  But yeah, it's Fortnite.
[8228.49s -> 8229.85s]  You got it. You got it right.
[8230.49s -> 8231.69s]  What's that one that goes like this?
[8231.69s -> 8233.37s]  This is amazing.
[8233.37s -> 8236.97s]  Thank you.
[8236.97s -> 8237.69s]  What's that one?
[8237.69s -> 8238.65s]  One that goes like this?
[8239.37s -> 8251.03s]  So...
[8251.03s -> 8251.67s]  I don't know.
[8251.67s -> 8253.82s]  I don't know.
[8253.82s -> 8254.54s]  I don't know.
[8254.54s -> 8255.10s]  I don't know.
[8255.10s -> 8255.66s]  I don't know.
[8255.66s -> 8256.22s]  I don't know.
[8256.22s -> 8256.78s]  I don't know.
[8256.78s -> 8257.50s]  I don't know.
[8258.14s -> 8263.82s]  So like last year, we represent just like the teeniest portion of the...
[8264.54s -> 8269.02s]  Now over a thousand people who work to make Fortnite.
[8269.02s -> 8269.74s]  What does that mean?
[8269.74s -> 8272.14s]  It's like a thousand players every single day.
[8273.10s -> 8278.54s]  We'd like to thank all the thousand people that are spending millions of dollars on the store
[8278.54s -> 8282.86s]  to have the opportunity to even make something like Fortnite.
[8283.58s -> 8284.30s]  It's incredible.
[8285.10s -> 8289.50s]  I think that, you know, as I was saying earlier, right?
[8289.50s -> 8294.62s]  Like this idea that we need to lean into what a persistent virtual place can be.
[8294.62s -> 8297.82s]  And the more that we're trying to experiment with stuff and try different things,
[8299.50s -> 8304.38s]  we're finding more and more that our goal is to try to create a metaverse.
[8304.38s -> 8306.14s]  To create a place, right?
[8306.14s -> 8309.50s]  Where all IP can live together.
[8309.50s -> 8312.22s]  Where all kinds of experiences can happen.
[8312.22s -> 8315.34s]  Where we can create a thing that is totally new.
[8315.34s -> 8319.34s]  A totally new emergent type of media, really.
[8319.90s -> 8323.66s]  And we are so inspired by everything you're doing.
[8323.66s -> 8326.46s]  I'm just blown away by what we see here tonight.
[8326.46s -> 8329.10s]  It's truly astounding and incredible.
[8331.82s -> 8333.66s]  Thank you for all the work you do.
[8333.66s -> 8336.54s]  Thank you for all the people who play Fortnite.
[8336.54s -> 8341.26s]  For who come up to all of us all the time and give us your incredible ideas and your feedback.
[8341.74s -> 8343.90s]  We just can't wait to keep making more.
[8345.26s -> 8348.78s]  I'd be remiss if I didn't take one little personal note to thank my wife,
[8348.78s -> 8351.10s]  my daughter, my family, my party people.
[8352.06s -> 8352.94s]  We love you.
[8352.94s -> 8353.82s]  Thank you so much.
[8355.50s -> 8357.77s]  See you guys Saturday.
[8357.77s -> 8359.61s]  And you got to do, you got to get credit for credit.
[8362.17s -> 8367.45s]  They took a game that was a like third person plants versus zombies,
[8367.45s -> 8368.97s]  like dumb third person shooter.
[8368.97s -> 8371.77s]  And they made it a BR that every single human role.
[8371.77s -> 8381.19s]  The developers who worked on Max Payne, Quantum Break, Armor 3, World of Danks.
[8381.19s -> 8384.47s]  And they did that pursuit mobile.
[8386.55s -> 8402.95s]  But it's because of.
[8410.54s -> 8412.06s]  Intel is located.
[8412.06s -> 8412.86s]  Okay.
[8412.86s -> 8414.06s]  Thanks, Jane.
[8414.06s -> 8416.06s]  But the competition is sending their team.
[8416.78s -> 8417.90s]  As expected.
[8417.90s -> 8418.94s]  Let's get this job done.
[8421.02s -> 8429.53s]  What have they even shown?
[8430.49s -> 8430.89s]  There you go.
[8430.89s -> 8431.93s]  That's nine to five.
[8431.93s -> 8432.89s]  And I'm here with Red Hill Games.
[8432.89s -> 8437.05s]  They spent more time on the fake trailer than they did at the video game that they made.
[8437.05s -> 8437.77s]  What can we expect?
[8437.77s -> 8438.09s]  Thank you.
[8438.09s -> 8439.13s]  I'm glad to be here.
[8439.13s -> 8442.97s]  Nine to five is a new first person tactical shooter.
[8442.97s -> 8445.61s]  It's set in a world where corporations rule everything.
[8445.61s -> 8447.61s]  And being a mercenary is just another job.
[8447.61s -> 8450.97s]  Now a lot of modern shooters can be a little bit chaotic.
[8450.97s -> 8453.77s]  And that's kind of what makes nine to five special.
[8453.77s -> 8458.57s]  We really put a lot of focus on the strategic gameplay of the team and playing together.
[8459.45s -> 8462.41s]  Making your changes and your tactics from round to round.
[8462.41s -> 8465.85s]  And obviously all that triumphs over brute force at the end.
[8465.85s -> 8466.17s]  All right.
[8466.17s -> 8467.53s]  Well, when can we expect to hear more?
[8467.53s -> 8468.41s]  Next year or?
[8468.41s -> 8470.81s]  So 2020 we're launching the alpha.
[8470.81s -> 8474.57s]  But you can actually sign up today at nine to five dot game.
[8474.57s -> 8475.69s]  So go ahead.
[8475.69s -> 8477.05s]  Enjoy and download.
[8477.05s -> 8477.37s]  All right.
[8477.37s -> 8478.33s]  A little bit of a tease.
[8478.33s -> 8479.21s]  Nine to five.
[8479.21s -> 8479.45s]  All right.
[8479.45s -> 8480.49s]  Thanks very much for being here.
[8480.49s -> 8480.73s]  Thanks.
[8480.73s -> 8481.29s]  Appreciate it.
[8481.29s -> 8481.45s]  All right.
[8481.45s -> 8486.97s]  We're going to hand out some more awards right now in the category of esports game of the year.
[8486.97s -> 8495.69s]  The nominees are Counter-Strike Global Offensive, Dota 2, Fortnite, League of Legends, and Overwatch.

[8516.10s -> 8518.18s]  and Trover Saves the Universe.
[8519.54s -> 8522.90s]  And the game award goes to Beat Saber.
[8522.90s -> 8524.42s]  Congratulations to Beat Games.
[8525.30s -> 8527.94s]  Why is Trover Saves the Universe?

[8552.09s -> 8556.81s]  And the game award goes to Mads Mikkelsen for Death Stranding.
[8556.81s -> 8558.01s]  Congratulations, Mads.
[8559.05s -> 8563.13s]  This year he also added a fan category over the past few days.
[8563.13s -> 8567.13s]  He's going to get told he won that tomorrow by somebody that works with him in an office or
[8567.13s -> 8567.45s]  something.
[8567.45s -> 8568.33s]  Your favorite game.
[8568.33s -> 8570.81s]  This was 100% in control of the fans.
[8571.45s -> 8576.01s]  And the winner of the fan vote is Fire Emblem Three Houses.
[8576.01s -> 8576.97s]  Congratulations.
[8578.01s -> 8578.81s]  All right.
[8578.81s -> 8583.69s]  Well, throughout the show, you've heard incredible stories about global gaming citizens.
[8583.69s -> 8586.89s]  And we're so honored to have them here with us tonight.
[8586.89s -> 8591.85s]  Please join me in recognizing this year's class of global gaming citizens.
[8592.41s -> 8593.77s]  We joke, but that's not even true.
[8593.77s -> 8598.01s]  Because didn't Mads Mikkelsen actually say that he was like excited for like where the
[8598.01s -> 8599.05s]  medium is going?
[8599.05s -> 8600.49s]  And that's not that's unfair.
[8600.49s -> 8601.37s]  That's unfair.
[8601.37s -> 8602.01s]  That's unfair.
[8603.29s -> 8604.49s]  Congratulations, guys.
[8611.40s -> 8611.90s]  Beautiful.
[8612.52s -> 8613.16s]  A selfie.
[8613.16s -> 8613.96s]  All right.
[8613.96s -> 8615.08s]  We're so proud of that program.
[8615.08s -> 8616.60s]  We intend to continue that year after year.
[8616.60s -> 8621.48s]  I love telling all these stories of amazing people around the world who I think represent
[8621.48s -> 8622.44s]  gaming at its best.
[8622.44s -> 8622.92s]  All right.
[8622.92s -> 8625.48s]  Up next, we've got music from Green Day.
[8625.48s -> 8627.48s]  Reggie's in the house to present.
[8627.48s -> 8628.92s]  Reggie's in the house.
[8628.92s -> 8630.76s]  We've got more world premieres.
[8630.76s -> 8631.96s]  Reggie's still here.
[8631.96s -> 8633.16s]  I thought I laughed my ass off.
[8634.04s -> 8635.80s]  Actually, they're like, Reggie's here.
[8635.80s -> 8636.44s]  Reggie's here.
[8636.44s -> 8638.36s]  And the show's charity's just gone.
[8638.36s -> 8639.08s]  But he's left.
[8639.08s -> 8641.96s]  Black Desert has only been available for PC and console.
[8641.96s -> 8643.08s]  Oh, Reggie left.
[8643.80s -> 8645.00s]  What the fuck are we doing now?
[8645.00s -> 8649.64s]  You can download it tonight and get a true MMORPG at your fingertips.
[8649.64s -> 8650.12s]  Check it out.
[8669.13s -> 8673.29s]  Somebody just said, I can't believe they actually showed the Xbox.
[8674.01s -> 8675.05s]  The new Xbox.
[8676.79s -> 8677.83s]  That's insane.
[8678.39s -> 8679.59s]  I haven't even processed that.
[8686.15s -> 8689.35s]  There's somebody at E3 right now that organizes E3
[8690.15s -> 8693.43s]  that did a double hand on the desk go through the center of the table.
[8694.39s -> 8695.59s]  It's just bent in half.
[8718.42s -> 8720.50s]  At E3, we've decided.
[8721.62s -> 8723.38s]  They already talked about the Xbox.
[8723.38s -> 8725.46s]  And the PS5 is leaked already.
[8725.46s -> 8726.18s]  Shit, what do we do?
[8726.98s -> 8728.74s]  All right, we're going to come up with a console.
[8728.74s -> 8730.10s]  The E3 console.
[8731.99s -> 8733.67s]  Make sure it's more powerful than the Xbox.
[8734.23s -> 8737.22s]  We can run our own damn show.
[8742.36s -> 8743.32s]  The EEB.
[8744.04s -> 8745.80s]  The Electronic Entertainment Box.
[8747.06s -> 8747.46s]  Launch it.
[8778.41s -> 8780.94s]  I wonder.
[8781.82s -> 8786.14s]  I wonder who paid the most money on this particular game awards.
[8788.07s -> 8789.43s]  Can't be magic together.
[8793.83s -> 8794.95s]  Joe, back to back.
[8795.91s -> 8796.55s]  Back to back.
[8797.27s -> 8798.95s]  HDR is where it's at.
[8799.51s -> 8800.87s]  Quantum dot technology.
[8800.87s -> 8802.95s]  These two paid for half this fucking show.
[8802.95s -> 8808.39s]  Full array local dimming allows the brightest and darkest parts of the scene to look their best.
[8808.39s -> 8814.95s]  Features like these are why Samsung QLED TV was a Best of Innovation honoree for gaming at CES 2019.
[8814.95s -> 8815.51s]  He's so good.
[8815.51s -> 8817.83s]  And they're nominated again for 2020.
[8817.83s -> 8820.95s]  I just wanted to turn around and face the camera, but it's just like.
[8821.99s -> 8829.50s]  Play this game.
[8829.50s -> 8834.38s]  Letters written in the first couple months.
[8834.38s -> 8836.46s]  Which is just we were not prepared.
[8836.46s -> 8840.41s]  Words is a game about writing nice letters to people.
[8840.41s -> 8845.53s]  All real people anonymously online sharing their worries and making each other feel better.
[8847.51s -> 8851.03s]  Pushing the definition of games is something that I really get excited about.
[8860.63s -> 8861.83s]  Endless world.
[8865.11s -> 8867.03s]  Endless heroes.
[8867.03s -> 8868.47s]  This music is perfect.
[8869.27s -> 8872.71s]  You'll never stop spending money in our fucking endless game.
[8873.75s -> 8874.87s]  You're gonna try.
[8875.59s -> 8877.11s]  But once you run out of gems.
[8877.91s -> 8879.35s]  You're gonna have to pay money.
[8879.91s -> 8882.31s]  Or wait 25 minutes to continue playing.
[8885.99s -> 8889.74s]  Oh, it says it's free.
[8889.74s -> 8891.58s]  But you and I both know it's not.
[8893.37s -> 8894.65s]  WD Black.
[8894.65s -> 8898.25s]  Fine tuned for performance.
[8898.25s -> 8900.81s]  Purpose built for gaming to play without limits.
[8901.77s -> 8906.57s]  Storage solutions with the capacity, speed, and reliability to win.
[8907.37s -> 8909.29s]  WD Black.
[8910.01s -> 8910.89s]  Drive your game.
[8919.02s -> 8920.38s]  The Undertaker will take your money.
[8920.38s -> 8924.38s]  We are excited to welcome WD Black to the Game Awards as the official storage sponsor.
[8924.38s -> 8928.22s]  All of tonight's world premieres have been safely stored on WD Black.
[8928.22s -> 8931.10s]  And is Reggie still in the audience?
[8931.10s -> 8935.82s]  For a chance to win a decked out gaming rig and WD Black products.
[8935.82s -> 8936.54s]  All right.
[8936.54s -> 8939.98s]  Now I'm very excited to introduce our next performance.
[8940.62s -> 8942.94s]  One of my passions outside of gaming is live music.
[8942.94s -> 8947.26s]  Whenever I go to a show, I'm always thinking about who would be perfect here for the Game Awards.
[8952.06s -> 8952.46s]  Here it comes.
[8960.86s -> 8962.06s]  Am I allowed to stream this part?
[8963.82s -> 8964.86s]  Is this Vaude getting immuted?
[8983.86s -> 8985.06s]  Do I have to mute my Vaude?
[8986.02s -> 8989.00s]  I have to, I can't, I can't stream this part.
[8990.46s -> 8991.90s]  I actually can't stream this part.
[8999.14s -> 9000.10s]  Can I?
[9000.10s -> 9010.68s]  Live stream.
[9010.68s -> 9011.24s]  Just sing it.
[9011.24s -> 9049.93s]  Oh, he's standing up for the first time all the way on the warm show.
[9050.65s -> 9052.44s]  Get the glasses.
[9053.08s -> 9117.03s]  Oh, a lot of people are just like, they keep going.
[9118.07s -> 9121.43s]  I forgot the words to the song.
[9122.31s -> 9125.19s]  Somebody come, somebody go to the mic.
[9125.19s -> 9125.91s]  I don't remember the song.
[9150.25s -> 9154.10s]  Everybody loves Green Day.
[9155.06s -> 9158.92s]  How could you not like it?
[9158.92s -> 9159.80s]  Everything's different.
[9159.80s -> 9160.60s]  What do you mean?
[9160.60s -> 9161.80s]  Yeah, how could you?
[9161.80s -> 9162.36s]  I mean, no.
[9165.80s -> 9168.44s]  There's at least one Green Day song that you actually like.
[9168.44s -> 9169.00s]  I know there is.
[9172.36s -> 9173.96s]  You added it to your Spotify playlist.
[9175.08s -> 9175.64s]  At least one.
[9185.86s -> 9193.54s]  And I know this because almost every single high school commencement ceremony ends with a Green Day song.
[9194.89s -> 9196.49s]  And you nodded your head to it.
[9214.42s -> 9216.50s]  Please bring Bunsen and Beaker out here.
[9217.40s -> 9224.86s]  Please get Bunsen and Beaker out here.
[9224.86s -> 9234.89s]  Look for it, look for it.
[9234.89s -> 9236.57s]  This one, it's the one, you know what I'm talking about.
[9236.57s -> 9239.37s]  It's gonna be like elbows in, out, out, bend, bend, bend.
[9239.93s -> 9240.25s]  Watch.
[9241.45s -> 9241.93s]  We'll see.
[9243.14s -> 9243.86s]  Follow my finger.
[9246.41s -> 9247.13s]  Follow my finger.
[9247.93s -> 9248.78s]  You watch.
[9251.02s -> 9253.46s]  There it comes.
[9253.46s -> 9257.24s]  It's the, and you bend up, down, that one.
[9258.70s -> 9259.34s]  No, fuck.
[9263.83s -> 9264.39s]  Somebody doing it.
[9273.56s -> 9284.26s]  I don't even give a shit about the song going on.
[9284.26s -> 9286.42s]  I'm like looking for the Fortnite dancer.
[9287.46s -> 9339.35s]  I'm the only one doing it.
[9339.91s -> 9343.40s]  I'm the only person doing this.
[9344.20s -> 9345.72s]  Now, do I have to put them down?
[9345.72s -> 9348.60s]  But I can't because that means that I've been admitting defeat.
[9349.48s -> 9367.02s]  Nobody did it.
[9367.02s -> 9384.89s]  I was, I was.
[9384.89s -> 9385.61s]  How about that?
[9385.61s -> 9386.65s]  Green Day, everybody.
[9387.61s -> 9391.13s]  The world's virtual reality and rock just collided like never before.
[9391.13s -> 9394.57s]  Beat Saber and Green Day, the collab we've always wanted.
[9394.57s -> 9396.33s]  And you don't have to wait long.
[9396.33s -> 9400.33s]  The music pack drops tonight on all platforms.
[9400.33s -> 9403.29s]  Soon to be able to play six of the band's iconic hits
[9403.29s -> 9405.69s]  and brand new singles from the album, Father of All,
[9405.69s -> 9407.69s]  which is out on February 7th.
[9407.69s -> 9411.13s]  Thank you so much to Green Day for playing the Game Awards.
[9411.85s -> 9413.53s]  We have a lot of shows still coming up.
[9413.53s -> 9415.53s]  Of course, we've got the award for best game direction.
[9415.53s -> 9416.97s]  You got, all right, game of the year.
[9416.97s -> 9419.45s]  And yes, we've still got some announcements and surprises for you guys.
[9419.45s -> 9421.61s]  He's trying to, at gaming's biggest night.
[9421.61s -> 9422.81s]  It just gets bigger and bigger.
[9422.81s -> 9424.41s]  He's trying to make this a big deal.
[9424.41s -> 9426.89s]  I, you gotta, you gotta give it a try.
[9426.89s -> 9427.61s]  He's trying.
[9427.61s -> 9428.11s]  Yes.
[9430.25s -> 9433.61s]  No, they're not leaving.
[9433.61s -> 9435.29s]  They're going back to their seat.
[9435.29s -> 9441.75s]  It is an eternal island of legend.
[9441.75s -> 9445.35s]  Place of unimaginable beauty.
[9450.89s -> 9453.77s]  Where the forces of death and life.
[9454.97s -> 9457.48s]  Constant conflict.
[9463.61s -> 9464.11s]  Listen!
[9470.02s -> 9470.52s]  What?
[9470.74s -> 9474.42s]  For centuries, many have come in search of power.
[9474.42s -> 9475.22s]  I'm not doing this.
[9479.05s -> 9479.85s]  Am I doing this?
[9481.88s -> 9484.12s]  Only to fall to its corruption.
[9484.12s -> 9485.00s]  I'm not playing this, right?
[9485.64s -> 9495.34s]  I'm not, it's not, the video's not open.
[9511.34s -> 9511.84s]  It's real.
[9512.70s -> 9531.93s]  To this place, lured by the promise of power and immortality.
[9533.61s -> 9535.90s]  This will claim you.
[9537.18s -> 9545.82s]  Do you really want to live?
[9545.82s -> 9546.62s]  Oh, I love it.
[9548.14s -> 9549.02s]  That's New World.
[9549.02s -> 9552.54s]  And I was just down at Irvine at the studio visiting the devs a couple months ago.
[9552.54s -> 9553.90s]  Had a great time playing it.
[9553.90s -> 9554.54s]  Looks really cool.
[9554.54s -> 9556.94s]  And you can get more info at newworld.com.
[9557.66s -> 9558.06s]  All right.
[9558.06s -> 9562.38s]  Well, now please welcome to the stage a good friend of the Game Awards.
[9562.38s -> 9567.10s]  He's been here every year since the first show with a perfect attendance record.
[9567.10s -> 9569.90s]  Of course, he's the former president of Nintendo of America.
[9569.90s -> 9570.70s]  A friend to all of us.
[9570.70s -> 9571.20s]  Let's go!
[9572.54s -> 9573.04s]  Bring him on!
[9573.04s -> 9575.04s]  Give it up for Reggie Fesemek!
[9580.65s -> 9582.09s]  Got the cool glasses.
[9582.81s -> 9584.73s]  And he's got the cool glasses.
[9593.36s -> 9594.88s]  You all made fun of me for that?
[9599.02s -> 9600.78s]  Fesemek is in the house.
[9604.40s -> 9606.80s]  Thank you, thank you, thank you for that warm welcome.
[9608.27s -> 9613.63s]  It was just over 16 years ago that I joined this industry as an executive.
[9614.83s -> 9621.63s]  But truth be told, I've been around as a fan and as a player for so much longer.
[9622.84s -> 9627.24s]  Like you, I've witnessed the growth of our favorite form of entertainment.
[9628.20s -> 9631.56s]  And now video games are bigger than the movie industry.
[9634.67s -> 9635.79s]  Bigger than music.
[9635.79s -> 9637.71s]  Can he just be the president of all video games?
[9637.71s -> 9642.00s]  Bigger than television.
[9642.00s -> 9645.92s]  But most importantly, video games continue to innovate.
[9646.88s -> 9652.88s]  Not only as entertainment, but also into areas far more profound.
[9653.84s -> 9660.48s]  Experiences with their foundation in video game technology are being used to help surgeons
[9660.48s -> 9662.72s]  practice before a difficult procedure.
[9663.76s -> 9670.24s]  And to enable college students to simulate business situations and develop real-world skills.
[9671.20s -> 9674.86s]  I may no longer be an executive in this industry,
[9675.58s -> 9681.98s]  but I'll always be an ambassador for video games as a force for good and a force for fun.
[9682.94s -> 9688.57s]  He's quitting?
[9689.93s -> 9690.97s]  Don't think you got the memo.
[9692.11s -> 9694.99s]  In this category, fresh indie game,
[9695.71s -> 9700.19s]  you can see how games are continuing to evolve as entertainment.
[9701.60s -> 9704.56s]  I think this is the most important award of the night.
[9705.44s -> 9711.12s]  Because I believe indie developers are the most important creators in this industry.
[9716.38s -> 9716.94s]  Why?
[9716.94s -> 9718.54s]  Why, who wrote that?
[9718.54s -> 9725.66s]  Because every nominee this year and every year at one time was an indie developer.
[9726.91s -> 9733.23s]  In the same sense that everyone was once a kid sketching a superhero in the middle of class.
[9734.44s -> 9740.52s]  Or lying in bed at night thinking of worlds and challenges that no one had ever dreamed of before.
[9741.40s -> 9749.95s]  For my friend, Shigeru Miyamoto, those ideas began around the woods near his house in Kyoto.
[9750.99s -> 9753.55s]  And for my dear departed friend, Satoru Iwata,
[9754.36s -> 9761.48s]  those ideas led him to invent his first video game on a portable calculator while he was still in high school.
[9765.34s -> 9767.18s]  These guys fucking made everything.
[9768.06s -> 9772.38s]  They both became fixtures in the history of video games.
[9773.26s -> 9775.42s]  But first, they were dreamers.
[9776.14s -> 9778.54s]  And they began with their imagination.
[9779.50s -> 9784.22s]  So like everyone else, at the start, they were true indie developers.
[9785.72s -> 9790.52s]  Any awards event is, by definition, a look backwards.
[9791.24s -> 9793.88s]  Who's done something great in the preceding year?
[9795.21s -> 9797.93s]  But in this category, you can look forward.
[9799.20s -> 9804.24s]  If you want to see the incubator where future game greatness is evolving,
[9805.20s -> 9809.04s]  it resides right here in this indie category,
[9809.04s -> 9815.28s]  recognizing brand new independent studios who released their first game this year.
[9815.92s -> 9816.42s]  Really?
[9818.14s -> 9820.62s]  Fresh indie game presented by Subway.
[9823.29s -> 9824.49s]  Oh shit, this is really?
[9849.53s -> 9850.17s]  They're all good.
[9851.96s -> 9854.44s]  And the game award goes to...
[9857.18s -> 9858.38s]  Disco Elysium.
[9859.34s -> 9865.90s]  Disco Elysium also wins Best Independent Game.
[9865.90s -> 9869.18s]  Tonight, they're taking home a total of four game awards.
[9879.36s -> 9885.36s]  So I'd like to thank all the great people that came before us.
[9885.36s -> 9886.16s]  Ilya Repin,
[9887.04s -> 9887.92s]  Ilya Repin,
[9888.56s -> 9889.92s]  Vladimir Mayakovsky,
[9890.96s -> 9891.76s]  Viktor Tsoi,
[9892.96s -> 9896.80s]  and Marks and Engels for providing us the political education.
[9896.80s -> 9897.28s]  Thank you.
[9898.48s -> 9909.40s]  Well, come here.
[9910.28s -> 9918.54s]  I've been looking back, looking back my whole life.
[9919.26s -> 9922.14s]  Back to my family, my friends,
[9923.48s -> 9924.12s]  my son.
[9924.92s -> 9930.27s]  They say you can't change a person, but a person can change with time.
[9932.36s -> 9934.12s]  Change a mind, change a heart.
[9937.82s -> 9939.90s]  Yeah, that might be good enough for you.
[9939.98s -> 9947.71s]  But I can change anything.
[9952.60s -> 9958.20s]  Is that a game?
[9958.20s -> 9960.92s]  Is this another single player League of Legends game?
[9961.96s -> 9962.84s]  Alright, surprise.
[9962.84s -> 9965.64s]  There's a second League of Legends announcement tonight.
[9965.64s -> 9968.60s]  I'm joined by the creative director of Double Stallion Games, Lee Thomas.
[9968.60s -> 9971.32s]  Lee, why don't you tell us a bit about what we just saw?
[9971.32s -> 9971.72s]  Sure.
[9971.72s -> 9973.80s]  Well, that was quite an experience.
[9974.92s -> 9975.72s]  So yeah, we're here.
[9975.72s -> 9977.72s]  It's been an amazing time keeping this secret,
[9977.72s -> 9981.64s]  but we are working with Riot Forge making Convergence, a League of Legends story.
[9982.44s -> 9983.16s]  So what is it?
[9983.16s -> 9986.36s]  It's a single player action platformer where you play Echo.
[9986.36s -> 9990.60s]  Echo is a young inventor who has created a device that can manipulate time.
[9990.60s -> 9994.04s]  And we're going to send you down into Zorn, into the depths of the sump.
[9994.04s -> 9998.04s]  And we're going to deliver a rich story experience about perils and consequences of
[9998.04s -> 10004.28s]  League of Legends has so many fans and people really, really love these characters.
[10004.36s -> 10009.00s]  They wouldn't just like Disney style, just make like eight different Mickey Mouse shows.
[10009.00s -> 10009.24s]  All right.
[10009.24s -> 10013.24s]  In just a moment, five of the nominees are going to go head to head in the best game
[10013.24s -> 10014.28s]  direction category.
[10014.28s -> 10015.32s]  We'll see who wins that one.
[10015.32s -> 10017.08s]  And we've still got some surprises left.
[10017.08s -> 10018.68s]  The game awards will be right back.
[10020.28s -> 10023.40s]  So they've like how many no stadium?
[10023.40s -> 10024.76s]  No, I'm sorry.
[10024.76s -> 10025.48s]  I am talking.
[10028.01s -> 10029.85s]  How many champions are in League of Legends?
[10029.85s -> 10030.97s]  Like 250.
[10031.87s -> 10034.51s]  That's 250 different separate TV shows they could make.
[10043.02s -> 10045.26s]  Stadia is a gift that won't ever stop growing.
[10046.22s -> 10047.98s]  A gift that doesn't take up any space.
[10049.66s -> 10059.44s]  The gift of a gift that gives you games anywhere and everywhere and anywhere
[10059.44s -> 10062.48s]  and any everywhere with Wi-Fi.
[10062.48s -> 10065.84s]  You can even ask yourself for Stadia and give it to yourself.
[10066.80s -> 10070.16s]  Get the unthinkable, multi-screenable, no downloads, no updates,
[10070.16s -> 10072.56s]  self-giftable gift of Stadia.
[10073.36s -> 10076.08s]  One place for all the ways we play.
[10080.89s -> 10083.05s]  When are you ever going to do that on an iPhone screen?
[10085.76s -> 10087.20s]  Be real with me for a minute.
[10087.20s -> 10089.76s]  Why would you just bring it to you and take a shit?
[10090.80s -> 10092.16s]  But then you have to have the controller.
[10092.88s -> 10096.64s]  So you have the controller in your hand, but then you have an iPhone that you hold in your mouth.
[10098.00s -> 10102.67s]  I go, gee, can you use the iPhone to do it?
[10102.67s -> 10103.63s]  Is the iPhone a controller?
[10104.35s -> 10113.68s]  Do you have to take the phone and do a thing?
[10114.48s -> 10124.99s]  No, I don't want to just put that.
[10124.99s -> 10127.55s]  I don't want to feel like a big AAA game on the toilet.
[10128.11s -> 10133.47s]  When I sit down to play a game, I sit there for like fucking two hours sometimes.
[10134.27s -> 10135.79s]  I'm not going to sit on the toilet for two hours.
[10135.79s -> 10136.83s]  I've done it before.
[10138.67s -> 10152.19s]  Oh, that's actually kind of cool.
[10152.83s -> 10155.64s]  I would play that.
[10155.64s -> 10158.92s]  Nintendo Switch has worlds to explore and adventures to conquer.
[10162.89s -> 10165.93s]  But that trailer was kind of bizarre.
[10167.29s -> 10168.41s]  I would probably play that game.
[10169.53s -> 10180.83s]  Find your adventure on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch Lite.
[10181.79s -> 10183.71s]  I forgot that came out.
[10184.35s -> 10186.19s]  We heard you may want to quit vaping.
[10186.19s -> 10187.63s]  But we can't help you.
[10187.63s -> 10189.31s]  We can barely hold these protest signs.
[10189.31s -> 10191.55s]  But we can tell you about this is quitting.
[10191.55s -> 10193.23s]  An easy text to quit service.
[10193.23s -> 10193.95s]  It's the least.
[10193.95s -> 10195.31s]  And most we can do.
[10198.88s -> 10199.68s]  I don't need to say it.
[10201.20s -> 10203.28s]  Oh, it's back.
[10203.28s -> 10206.72s]  Look at all the information on the screen.
[10208.56s -> 10210.08s]  Did I count four health bars?
[10213.04s -> 10220.80s]  This is like when you go to someone's house that has a World of Warcraft.
[10221.52s -> 10223.44s]  And they have like 30 mods installed.
[10224.48s -> 10229.12s]  And you can't even physically log in with your character because everything is so fucking strange.
[10229.12s -> 10230.40s]  The UI is so different.
[10230.40s -> 10232.00s]  And they have like a million things on the screen.
[10232.56s -> 10240.40s]  I played all games like that with no, uh, you probably can't hear what I'm saying.
[10251.39s -> 10261.77s]  Never mind.
[10261.77s -> 10262.73s]  What's going on, everybody?
[10262.73s -> 10265.13s]  I'm professional esports host and commentator Goldenboy.
[10265.13s -> 10271.93s]  And since 2017, Samsung and Xbox have worked together to deliver amazing experiences for all gamers.
[10271.93s -> 10276.09s]  That's why I teamed up with them to create something special for the fans.
[10276.09s -> 10278.57s]  The ultimate FTW sweepstakes.
[10278.57s -> 10284.01s]  And I want to give a huge shout out to our winner, Isaiah Yanez, also known as Buddy Roy.
[10284.01s -> 10287.13s]  You are the winner of the upgrade FTW sweepstakes.
[10287.13s -> 10295.29s]  You won this killer Samsung 75 inch Q70R QLED TV, a Q70 soundbar, an Xbox One X,
[10295.29s -> 10298.01s]  and 12 months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.
[10298.01s -> 10299.37s]  Safe to say that's a lot of nuts.
[10299.37s -> 10300.17s]  Congrats.
[10300.17s -> 10302.01s]  And thank you so much for joining us here tonight.
[10302.01s -> 10304.25s]  Now, everyone, let's just enjoy the game award some more.
[10304.89s -> 10305.61s]  I would.
[10305.61s -> 10306.09s]  I did it.
[10306.97s -> 10308.09s]  Thank you, Goldenboy.
[10308.09s -> 10312.17s]  And now it's time for a world premiere, a re-announcement that I think you'll be excited about.
[10312.17s -> 10313.13s]  A re-announcement.
[10313.13s -> 10313.69s]  Elden Ring.
[10315.13s -> 10316.81s]  All right, if it's Elden Ring, I'd be real happy.
[10317.37s -> 10317.93s]  Elden Ring.
[10320.27s -> 10326.75s]  There was a time when you were heartless, brutal monster.
[10330.49s -> 10332.89s]  And I'm proud of you for changing all that.
[10332.89s -> 10342.41s]  But I'm here to ask you to be those things once more for them.
[10342.41s -> 10347.72s]  For me, can I count on you?
[10347.72s -> 10349.48s]  Who the fuck is making this game?
[10349.48s -> 10349.98s]  Bigby.
[10350.92s -> 10352.20s]  Can I count on you?
[10355.42s -> 10367.21s]  Is that Ghost Written by Telltale?
[10367.21s -> 10371.45s]  Now, she's an Emmy-winning writer and an accomplished voice actor.
[10371.45s -> 10373.61s]  Please welcome Ashley Birch.
[10377.74s -> 10380.70s]  Didn't say somebody bought Telltale, right?
[10380.70s -> 10381.58s]  Hello, everyone.
[10382.62s -> 10383.74s]  They purchased Telltale.
[10385.18s -> 10389.34s]  The best games start with a single person asking a single question.
[10389.90s -> 10390.38s]  What if?
[10391.34s -> 10395.02s]  And when that question excites other people and they start asking what if,
[10395.02s -> 10397.58s]  it's a snowball of creativity and passion
[10397.58s -> 10400.14s]  that pushes games to be the best they can possibly be.
[10401.10s -> 10403.74s]  These are the nominees for the Best Game Direction.
[10405.26s -> 10406.06s]  Best Game Direction.
[10406.06s -> 10407.42s]  Who's making that game?
[10407.42s -> 10408.14s]  I can't get over it.
[10409.84s -> 10410.56s]  Who's making it?
[10413.52s -> 10415.36s]  So hard to pull a connection.
[10416.88s -> 10435.00s]  Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup.
[10435.64s -> 10437.96s]  Resident Evil 2, hands down, is the best one.
[10437.96s -> 10439.00s]  Hands down.
[10439.00s -> 10440.20s]  If it loses, Alex will be mad.
[10440.20s -> 10440.92s]  Death Stranding.
[10440.92s -> 10443.88s]  All right, that makes me actually, I'm actually upset about that.
[10443.88s -> 10448.20s]  I never get invested in this shit, but that actually makes me irritated.
[10448.20s -> 10449.72s]  I'm actually irritated by that.
[10449.72s -> 10450.22s]  I am.
[10454.80s -> 10460.40s]  Resident Evil 2, from start to finish, was close to perfectly paced.
[10464.81s -> 10467.90s]  Thank you.
[10467.98s -> 10468.70s]  Thank you so much.
[10479.56s -> 10481.96s]  It was a start from zero four years ago,
[10481.96s -> 10484.52s]  but I'm very happy to come back to this stage tonight.
[10498.84s -> 10520.76s]  I really want to thank a lot of people who started the ship going.
[10520.76s -> 10526.36s]  Sony started out with us and also Guerrilla for providing the game engine.
[10526.36s -> 10531.16s]  And also, it was a small boat, but all the cast came on board,
[10531.16s -> 10533.88s]  the musicians, the artists, the people who collaborated.
[10533.88s -> 10534.92s]  Thank you so much.
[10534.92s -> 10538.20s]  Konami right now is crying somewhere in slot machine revenue.
[10539.08s -> 10540.68s]  Came to work together.
[10540.68s -> 10545.08s]  I would really like to thank them and also my family.
[10545.88s -> 10549.08s]  And best of all, the fans who waited four years.
[10549.08s -> 10549.88s]  Thank you so much.
[10551.08s -> 10557.84s]  Konami looked at their balance sheet and said,
[10557.84s -> 10565.04s]  hey, we made more money in one day with our slot machines than in a decade of video game revenue.
[10565.04s -> 10567.44s]  We've got some very special surprise guests here to do the honors.
[10567.44s -> 10570.32s]  Over on Twitter, you guys voted for the gaming tweet of the year.
[10570.32s -> 10571.36s]  We've got the winning tweet.
[10571.36s -> 10571.84s]  Check it out.
[10571.84s -> 10574.48s]  And we'll be right back with game of the year.
[10575.12s -> 10575.68s]  It's over?
[10576.24s -> 10576.64s]  This is it.
[10576.64s -> 10577.04s]  It's coming up.
[10577.04s -> 10577.52s]  This is the end.
[10580.72s -> 10582.08s]  Resident Evil 2 has got to come.
[10582.08s -> 10582.72s]  It's got something.
[10583.92s -> 10585.44s]  Mr. X is like the best.
[10585.44s -> 10585.92s]  Mr. X.
[10586.88s -> 10597.90s]  Mr. X is the best video game antagonist for very, very, very long.
[10608.83s -> 10628.17s]  I think it's the masks because this is not Destiny 2,
[10628.17s -> 10630.89s]  but it's the Destiny 2 mask with the blue lights in it.
[10632.52s -> 10633.56s]  Yes, that's the problem.
[10633.56s -> 10638.76s]  Is there every game has the mask with the lights in it, the green or blue lights in the mask?
[10640.92s -> 10641.40s]  What is this?
[10642.36s -> 10654.65s]  It literally said it was ESO.
[10674.52s -> 10676.04s]  Is there a best VR game?
[10676.04s -> 10676.44s]  Why?
[10676.44s -> 10678.20s]  Why is that strangely absent?
[10679.16s -> 10680.73s]  Is that not here?
[10684.68s -> 10685.40s]  It already happened?
[10690.01s -> 10691.53s]  Why was super hot VR not on it?
[10692.41s -> 10699.95s]  Oh, super hot VR came out in 2017.
[10705.44s -> 10706.00s]  Excuse me.
[10715.32s -> 10716.60s]  Room temperature IQ.
[10717.40s -> 10719.26s]  Have you guys heard of Magic the Gathering?
[10719.98s -> 10721.10s]  Check it out.
[10721.98s -> 10725.42s]  Play right now.
[10743.24s -> 10743.96s]  All right.
[10743.96s -> 10744.52s]  What was that?
[10745.48s -> 10746.75s]  That looked cool.
[10746.75s -> 10747.79s]  Is it a Predator game?
[10764.73s -> 10766.01s]  No, I see the honeycomb.
[10766.01s -> 10766.73s]  I'm not interested.
[10767.37s -> 10773.20s]  You can guarantee I won't play a game if it has the honeycomb on it.
[10773.92s -> 10774.96s]  That's just personal preference.
[10774.96s -> 10775.36s]  I'm sorry.
[10801.66s -> 10802.94s]  Download a bunch of free games.
[10802.94s -> 10803.82s]  I keep them forever.
[10807.58s -> 10810.46s]  Now she's an actress and producer.
[10810.46s -> 10812.86s]  Please welcome Michelle Rodriguez.
[10813.98s -> 10815.82s]  That's how we add a game of the year.
[10815.82s -> 10820.73s]  How y'all doing today?
[10821.93s -> 10822.89s]  I've invested in this.
[10822.89s -> 10823.53s]  How are you?
[10823.53s -> 10826.54s]  I'm happy to be here.
[10827.92s -> 10831.44s]  There's one last game announcement to share with you tonight.
[10831.44s -> 10833.04s]  And I'm really excited about it.
[10834.24s -> 10839.68s]  Allow me to present the world premiere of our latest expansion to the Fast and Furious saga.
[10853.61s -> 10854.49s]  I'm inflated.
[10856.81s -> 10857.93s]  Is it a movie?
[10857.93s -> 10858.73s]  I'm going to split.
[10859.45s -> 10861.21s]  It's the only way to keep you both safe.
[10862.57s -> 10864.70s]  I think I know someone who can help.
[10868.86s -> 10869.82s]  You ready to ride?
[10870.70s -> 10874.96s]  I'm hunting anybody.
[10874.96s -> 10883.57s]  Revenge.
[10884.91s -> 10886.11s]  We want justice.
[10886.11s -> 10888.27s]  Vin Diesel did not voice act in this game.
[10888.27s -> 10891.31s]  They just pulled samples from the last 10 movies.
[10892.67s -> 10893.96s]  You know how many times he says that?
[10897.48s -> 10899.06s]  Let's go.
[10901.52s -> 10902.02s]  For sure.
[10902.80s -> 10903.88s]  Come on.
[10903.88s -> 10906.30s]  When in doubt, do what I do.
[10906.30s -> 10906.86s]  See?
[10906.86s -> 10907.98s]  I've seen what you do.
[10908.94s -> 10913.31s]  That's why I'm kind of terrified.
[10913.31s -> 10914.67s]  And I don't need a finish line.
[10914.67s -> 10921.82s]  I'm in my own lane.
[10921.82s -> 10924.62s]  Vin Diesel will live off of royalties that people are using.
[10930.33s -> 10935.29s]  Vin Diesel will live forever with his just generic free sentences that he said.
[10939.45s -> 10942.83s]  He will be collecting just revenue forever.
[10942.83s -> 10944.19s]  I'm excited for that one.
[10946.43s -> 10947.47s]  Everyone wants to live forever.
[10949.47s -> 10954.27s]  From a little article in a newspaper to a movie to a video game.
[10954.27s -> 10955.07s]  It's pretty cool.
[10955.87s -> 10963.13s]  I'd like to now introduce a surprise guest and also one of my friends for life.
[10963.69s -> 10964.41s]  Is it Vin Diesel?
[10964.41s -> 10965.13s]  Vin Diesel.
[10966.17s -> 10980.19s]  I hope he just speaks in one-liners.
[10980.19s -> 10980.75s]  It would be great.
[10981.63s -> 10984.41s]  I want him to speak in one-liners.
[10985.05s -> 10985.55s]  Do it.
[10996.81s -> 11003.12s]  Michelle, we are in our crowd.
[11005.20s -> 11006.88s]  We have been gamers.
[11006.88s -> 11008.96s]  We have been gamers forever.
[11008.96s -> 11010.56s]  And we are at an award show.
[11011.20s -> 11012.08s]  Of our people.
[11012.08s -> 11013.60s]  Why is he leaning down sideways?
[11013.60s -> 11014.24s]  Literally.
[11014.24s -> 11015.04s]  Literally.
[11015.04s -> 11018.64s]  Me and Vin used to just like literally spend all night playing like
[11018.64s -> 11021.12s]  Tekken Fighter games or Street Fighter.
[11025.84s -> 11031.60s]  Yeah this is uh it's amazing to see that that trailer finally.
[11035.18s -> 11036.30s]  I didn't tell you before.
[11037.26s -> 11041.18s]  Yesterday I saw the four-minute trailer to Fast Night.
[11041.18s -> 11042.22s]  What is he doing?
[11042.22s -> 11043.02s]  Turn this way.
[11043.98s -> 11048.40s]  Why is this back to the audience?
[11048.40s -> 11050.40s]  Back to you guys.
[11050.40s -> 11053.08s]  Um I love all of you.
[11053.08s -> 11055.08s]  Uh okay so.
[11055.08s -> 11059.52s]  Like at this point Vin just grabbed the mic and lifted up from the base.
[11059.52s -> 11061.52s]  Here to pay tribute to all of the nominees.
[11061.52s -> 11064.52s]  Game of the year once again.
[11064.52s -> 11066.52s]  The Game Awards Orchestra.
[11068.52s -> 11071.08s]  Is it nailed down?
[11071.08s -> 11083.05s]  Just her reaction was awesome.
[11083.05s -> 11086.57s]  She's just like.
[11086.57s -> 11092.20s]  That little like yeah.
[11092.20s -> 11094.20s]  I am not certain of very many things.
[11094.20s -> 11096.20s]  But I am certain of this.
[11096.20s -> 11099.52s]  More than anything.
[11099.52s -> 11103.95s]  The Outer Worlds is not going to win Game of the Year.
[11103.95s -> 11116.25s]  I have never been more certain of something in my entire life.
[11116.25s -> 11118.25s]  It just will not.
[11118.25s -> 11126.40s]  Does that make me a villain for saying that?
[11126.40s -> 11128.40s]  That's not going to win Game of the Year.
[11130.40s -> 11132.40s]  That makes me a villain.
[11132.40s -> 11150.25s]  Apparently.
[11150.25s -> 11166.01s]  I mean but like Smash is like a pretty big achievement.
[11166.01s -> 11168.01s]  There's so much stuff in Smash.
[11168.01s -> 11170.01s]  There's so much in it.
[11170.01s -> 11172.01s]  There's like a thousand characters.
[11172.01s -> 11174.01s]  They keep adding them.
[11174.01s -> 11178.30s]  I've seen some.
[11181.82s -> 11183.82s]  That kind of startled me.
[11183.82s -> 11204.68s]  I mean it could be that too.
[11204.68s -> 11206.68s]  But I don't think so.
[11206.68s -> 11209.63s]  That wasn't it.
[11209.63s -> 11211.63s]  Sekiro was a really polarizing game.
[11211.63s -> 11213.63s]  It was very polarizing.
[11213.63s -> 11216.44s]  There's like a you either really liked it or you hated it.
[11216.44s -> 11218.44s]  For Sekiro.
[11218.44s -> 11223.44s]  Or a lot of people.
[11223.44s -> 11226.51s]  That was pretty polarizing.
[11226.51s -> 11232.72s]  I liked it.
[11232.72s -> 11234.72s]  Yeah.
[11234.72s -> 11236.72s]  And which game on this list.
[11236.72s -> 11238.72s]  Had no polarizing.
[11238.72s -> 11240.72s]  I mean besides this guy.
[11240.72s -> 11243.02s]  I don't know what.
[11243.02s -> 11252.99s]  Where did he come from?
[11252.99s -> 11254.99s]  He's the only one on that list that makes sense to me.
[11254.99s -> 11265.60s]  Come on.
[11265.60s -> 11267.60s]  Sekiro is good. It was. It was very good.
[11267.60s -> 11270.41s]  Smash Brothers.
[11270.41s -> 11272.41s]  Really good achievement in video games.
[11272.41s -> 11274.41s]  But Resident Evil.
[11274.41s -> 11276.41s]  The remake.
[11276.41s -> 11278.97s]  What remakes can be.
[11278.97s -> 11280.97s]  They keep telling me don't lean down.
[11280.97s -> 11284.56s]  As my daughter would say.
[11284.56s -> 11286.56s]  Dad.
[11286.56s -> 11288.56s]  But it's not.
[11288.56s -> 11290.56s]  It's very good.
[11290.56s -> 11292.56s]  The game of the year award.
[11292.56s -> 11298.32s]  Goes to.
[11298.32s -> 11305.55s]  Sekiro.
[11305.55s -> 11307.55s]  Tonight Sekiro Shadows Die Twice.
[11307.55s -> 11309.55s]  Also wins best action adventure game.
[11320.17s -> 11329.77s]  The knife just hit behind me.
[11329.77s -> 11331.77s]  Boom.
[11331.77s -> 11333.77s]  The tomahawk just hit the fucking wall.
[11333.77s -> 11343.10s]  I agree.
[11343.10s -> 11345.10s]  He's very moved.
[11345.10s -> 11347.10s]  He's very moved.
[11347.10s -> 11349.10s]  He's very moved.
[11349.10s -> 11351.10s]  If it wasn't Resident Evil.
[11351.10s -> 11353.10s]  I agree.
[11353.10s -> 11355.10s]  If it wasn't Resident Evil.
[11355.10s -> 11357.10s]  I agree.
[11357.10s -> 11359.10s]  If it wasn't Resident Evil.
[11359.10s -> 11361.10s]  I agree.
[11361.10s -> 11363.10s]  I agree.
[11363.10s -> 11365.10s]  So Sekiro
[11365.10s -> 11367.10s]  has a lot of difficult
[11367.10s -> 11369.10s]  and complex elements that made us a little
[11369.10s -> 11371.10s]  unsure.
[11371.10s -> 11373.10s]  When it was about to come out.
[11373.10s -> 11375.10s]  And we were both surprised
[11375.10s -> 11377.10s]  and overjoyed at the reaction
[11377.10s -> 11379.10s]  that we saw.
[11379.10s -> 11381.10s]  So I'd like to share
[11381.10s -> 11383.10s]  the joy of receiving this award
[11383.10s -> 11385.10s]  with the staff at From Software
[11385.10s -> 11387.10s]  who pulled out all the stops to make it happen
[11387.10s -> 11389.10s]  as well as the team at Activision
[11389.10s -> 11391.10s]  for their ongoing support throughout.
[11391.10s -> 11393.10s]  It was good.
[11393.10s -> 11395.10s]  We're sad that Resident Evil
[11395.10s -> 11397.10s]  didn't win anything.
[11412.08s -> 11414.08s]  And finally, I'd like to
[11414.08s -> 11416.08s]  give out a huge thank you
[11416.08s -> 11418.08s]  to our players.
[11418.08s -> 11420.08s]  We couldn't have done it without you
[11420.08s -> 11422.08s]  and it was a huge honor to make.
[11422.08s -> 11424.08s]  So we will continue to try and make
[11424.08s -> 11426.08s]  the best games we possibly can.
[11426.08s -> 11428.08s]  Thank you.
[11428.08s -> 11430.08s]  Congratulations from Software, Miyazaki-san.
[11430.08s -> 11436.80s]  Game of the Year for Sekiro.
[11436.80s -> 11447.74s]  Alright guys, well that's going to do it for the Game Awards 2019.
[11447.74s -> 11449.74s]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[11449.74s -> 11451.74s]  We'll see you again next time.
[11451.74s -> 11453.74s]  Thank you.
[11455.74s -> 11457.74s]  It's December, to keep celebrating games.
[11457.74s -> 11459.74s]  Have a great night. Thank you very much.
[11459.74s -> 11461.74s]  Good night everybody.
[11494.14s -> 11506.41s]  Here are my thoughts.
[11506.41s -> 11520.24s]  I don't remember any of the games.
[11520.24s -> 11522.67s]  I don't remember anything.
[11522.67s -> 11525.29s]  I remember
[11525.29s -> 11529.07s]  No More Heroes 3.
[11529.07s -> 11531.07s]  And then I remember the Gemini Man trailer.
[11531.07s -> 11535.61s]  So if that means anything,
[11535.61s -> 11537.61s]  that means
[11537.61s -> 11540.24s]  that No More Heroes 3 is probably
[11540.24s -> 11542.24s]  going to be cool, I think.
[11542.24s -> 11547.92s]  That's what that means.
[11547.92s -> 11549.92s]  Constant conflict.
[11549.92s -> 11551.92s]  We did get a constant conflict, you're right.
[11551.92s -> 11553.92s]  The Muppets came out, yeah.
[11553.92s -> 11555.92s]  They were there.
[11555.92s -> 11562.32s]  And The Goose was there too.
[11562.32s -> 11569.36s]  What else happened?
[11569.36s -> 11573.18s]  I don't know.
[11573.18s -> 11575.18s]  We saw a bunch of MMOs
[11575.18s -> 11577.18s]  and some mobile games.
[11577.18s -> 11582.56s]  Reggie was there, Green Day was there.
[11582.56s -> 11586.52s]  Magic the Gathering.
[11586.52s -> 11588.52s]  I'm kind of sad that
[11588.52s -> 11590.52s]  Resident Evil 2 didn't win anything.
[11590.52s -> 11593.02s]  The time that I had...
[11593.02s -> 11595.02s]  Let me get the headphone out of here.
[11595.02s -> 11598.28s]  I don't want anyone talking to me.
[11598.28s -> 11600.91s]  The feeling of real dread.
[11600.91s -> 11619.40s]  It was a remake.
[11619.40s -> 11622.60s]  So what?
[11622.60s -> 11626.76s]  It was a remake from 1998.
[11626.76s -> 11628.76s]  It was a really, really
[11628.76s -> 11630.76s]  good game.
[11630.76s -> 11632.76s]  It was the feeling of dread
[11632.76s -> 11634.76s]  going around corners.
[11634.76s -> 11636.76s]  It was brilliantly paced.
[11636.76s -> 11638.76s]  It was the revitalization of Capcom as a company.
[11638.76s -> 11640.76s]  They came out with Monster Hunter World.
[11640.76s -> 11642.76s]  That was great.
[11642.76s -> 11645.77s]  And then they had Resident Evil 2, and now they're coming out with Resident Evil 3.
[11645.77s -> 11650.44s]  You said that already.
[11650.44s -> 11652.44s]  Don't you know that when you lose,
[11652.44s -> 11654.44s]  you just go on repeat until you
[11654.44s -> 11662.32s]  go to sleep that night?
[11662.32s -> 11664.32s]  When the stream's over, I'm going to be in the mirror going,
[11664.32s -> 11666.32s]  the sense of dread that I had.
[11666.32s -> 11668.32s]  Turning the corners, Mr. X
[11668.32s -> 11670.32s]  was so brilliantly, brilliantly
[11670.32s -> 11673.52s]  cast. And then I'm going to
[11673.52s -> 11675.52s]  turn the shower on, like lean backwards
[11675.52s -> 11677.52s]  and have cold water just hit me right in my eyes.
[11677.52s -> 11682.57s]  Sekiro won. I know, I know.
[11682.57s -> 11684.57s]  But I think Resident Evil 2 deserves something.
[11684.57s -> 11686.57s]  Even if it was just like
[11686.57s -> 11688.57s]  they brought him on stage and gave him a fucking
[11688.57s -> 11690.57s]  like, you got a shot lollipop.
[11690.57s -> 11693.13s]  I thought it was Game of the Year. I thought it was.
[11693.13s -> 11695.13s]  I thought it was, but you know, whatever.
[11695.13s -> 11697.13s]  You can't win them all. You can't win them all.
[11697.13s -> 11699.13s]  Because I obviously had something to do with that game.
[11699.13s -> 11701.13s]  So I'm so invested.
[11701.13s -> 11708.17s]  You know, you can't win them all.
[11708.17s -> 11716.94s]  Alright, let's talk about Minecraft.
[11716.94s -> 11718.94s]  He's a 10 on the German scale. No, it was a fuck chill.
[11718.94s -> 11723.04s]  They're trying.
[11723.04s -> 11727.64s]  Alright, you guys ready?
[11727.64s -> 11729.64s]  Talking about constant conflict. I don't even know if that game was.
[11729.64s -> 11731.64s]  I just know it exists.
[11731.64s -> 11735.85s]  Okay, so
[11735.85s -> 11738.54s]  those of you that don't know what we're about to talk about
[11738.54s -> 11740.97s]  I actually have to change to just chatting.
[11740.97s -> 11743.60s]  If you just stuck around for the game awards
[11743.60s -> 11745.60s]  thanks for sticking around.
[11745.60s -> 11747.90s]  Those of you that are still here
[11747.90s -> 11749.90s]  we're going to spend a little bit of time going over what's going to happen
[11749.90s -> 11751.90s]  this weekend.
[11751.90s -> 11757.08s]  I never played the Claire campaign.
[11757.08s -> 11759.08s]  I didn't stream the Claire campaign.
[11759.08s -> 11761.64s]  What? I'm not allowed to play something?
[11761.64s -> 11763.64s]  I didn't, I did not play it off stream.
[11763.64s -> 11774.32s]  I'm lying to you.
[11774.32s -> 11776.32s]  No, I'm kidding.
[11776.32s -> 11778.32s]  My god. You think I would say something to Game of the Year
[11778.32s -> 11780.32s]  if I didn't do it all? I played half the game.
[11780.32s -> 11783.32s]  Hey, I played all of Sekiro
[11783.32s -> 11785.56s]  and I played half of Resident Evil 2
[11785.56s -> 11787.56s]  and I thought, uh oh, that's bad.
[11787.56s -> 11789.56s]  Somebody's going to be like, what the fuck did he just say?
[11789.56s -> 11795.64s]  Anyways,
[11795.64s -> 11797.64s]  take a look at your screen here.
[11797.64s -> 11804.68s]  We're going to do some drawing.
[11804.68s -> 11811.34s]  Take a look at your screen. We are going to talk about
[11811.34s -> 11813.34s]  what's happening this weekend.
[11813.34s -> 11815.34s]  What are you doing this weekend? What do you mean this weekend?
[11815.34s -> 11817.34s]  This weekend we're going to play a little game
[11817.34s -> 11819.34s]  called Fuck the King.
[11819.34s -> 11822.54s]  I didn't even change category. That's my bad.
[11822.54s -> 11826.57s]  I'll just keep it as obnoxious audience member.
[11826.57s -> 11836.17s]  That's fine.
[11836.17s -> 11838.67s]  So on Sunday,
[11838.67s -> 11840.67s]  there'll be, you'll, uh,
[11840.67s -> 11843.16s]  that's the next stream that's going to happen.
[11843.16s -> 11846.62s]  So you will not see me
[11846.62s -> 11850.20s]  until Sunday.
[11850.20s -> 11852.20s]  About an hour before the stream starts on Sunday
[11852.20s -> 11854.20s]  because there's a lot of stuff that we still need to do.
[11854.20s -> 11856.20s]  We will begin the process
[11856.20s -> 11858.20s]  of putting people into the server.
[11858.20s -> 11862.62s]  Show your Resident Evil 2 achievements.
[11862.62s -> 11867.10s]  No, I don't have to do that.
[11867.10s -> 11869.10s]  So, what is going to happen?
[11869.10s -> 11872.62s]  First and foremost, let's start drawing.
[11872.62s -> 11875.24s]  On Sunday, if you are
[11875.24s -> 11878.32s]  a two month
[11878.32s -> 11880.32s]  long subscriber,
[11880.32s -> 11882.32s]  why am I doing this?
[11882.32s -> 11893.96s]  The only way that you will have
[11893.96s -> 11895.96s]  access to this game
[11895.96s -> 11897.96s]  is if you have been subbed to the channel for two months straight.
[11897.96s -> 11901.61s]  The reason why this had to happen
[11901.61s -> 11903.79s]  is because of very obvious things.
[11903.79s -> 11906.54s]  We're trying to protect the server
[11906.54s -> 11908.54s]  from getting
[11908.54s -> 11910.54s]  just overloaded with people.
[11910.54s -> 11912.84s]  We're trying to protect the server from
[11912.84s -> 11914.84s]  insane amounts of connections.
[11914.84s -> 11917.66s]  And we do already have things in place
[11917.66s -> 11919.66s]  to help with that.
[11919.66s -> 11921.66s]  There's a lot of stuff that these guys are pros.
[11921.66s -> 11926.08s]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[11926.08s -> 11928.08s]  You have to be subbed for two months to play.
[11928.08s -> 11930.70s]  Now what does playing mean?
[11930.70s -> 11935.12s]  Playing is
[11935.12s -> 11937.48s]  opening up your Minecraft client,
[11937.48s -> 11939.48s]  going to the server,
[11939.48s -> 11941.48s]  and starting
[11941.48s -> 11943.85s]  in our little town.
[11943.85s -> 11947.76s]  Our little town is going to look like this.
[11947.76s -> 11953.13s]  Our little town
[11953.13s -> 11955.13s]  is going to look like this.
[11955.13s -> 11957.56s]  There's going to be a castle here.
[11957.56s -> 11961.98s]  Like this.
[11961.98s -> 11963.98s]  And down here there'll be some houses.
[11963.98s -> 11967.12s]  Probably, you know, just random little town houses.
[11967.12s -> 11970.38s]  There'll be a little garden over here.
[11970.38s -> 11974.92s]  No.
[11974.92s -> 11979.52s]  It's an apple.
[11979.52s -> 11981.52s]  It's a spider.
[11981.52s -> 11984.20s]  Will you guys just relax?
[11984.20s -> 11986.20s]  Alright, I can't look at chat. You guys are making me laugh.
[11988.64s -> 11990.64s]  So in this town,
[11990.64s -> 11992.64s]  there's a castle, right?
[11992.64s -> 11994.64s]  Ooh, look, the castle was here.
[11994.64s -> 11996.64s]  Inside of this castle is going to be
[11996.64s -> 11999.32s]  me. I am
[11999.32s -> 12004.64s]  the king of this kingdom.
[12004.64s -> 12006.64s]  The goal that you guys have, by the way,
[12006.64s -> 12008.64s]  there are, I gotta write this down too because I want as much
[12008.64s -> 12012.67s]  info as I can.
[12012.67s -> 12014.67s]  The server holds just about
[12014.67s -> 12016.67s]  just over 500 people.
[12016.67s -> 12020.38s]  Can be on this Minecraft server.
[12020.38s -> 12022.38s]  That's important. Two months substrate.
[12022.38s -> 12024.38s]  500 people can play at once.
[12024.38s -> 12028.09s]  And it's going to cycle out all the time.
[12028.09s -> 12030.27s]  Because we have a
[12030.27s -> 12032.27s]  some code and an API in place.
[12032.27s -> 12034.27s]  For, if you are a sub,
[12034.27s -> 12036.27s]  if you are a two month plus sub,
[12036.27s -> 12038.44s]  you just simply have to log into the server
[12038.44s -> 12040.44s]  and authenticate your, with Twitch.
[12040.44s -> 12042.44s]  That's how the whitelisting
[12042.44s -> 12046.09s]  is going to work. There's going to be a
[12046.09s -> 12048.09s]  separate little site that you're going
[12048.09s -> 12050.09s]  to link into.
[12050.09s -> 12052.09s]  And you'll get a code. And it'll verify
[12052.09s -> 12054.09s]  that you are subbed for two months.
[12054.09s -> 12056.33s]  And then you can join the server.
[12056.33s -> 12058.33s]  When you join the server,
[12058.33s -> 12062.11s]  you are going to be
[12062.11s -> 12065.24s]  zero years old.
[12065.24s -> 12069.66s]  Now what does that mean? That means
[12069.66s -> 12072.28s]  there's an aging system in the game.
[12072.28s -> 12074.28s]  It takes, as of right now,
[12074.28s -> 12077.15s]  ten hours
[12077.15s -> 12079.71s]  for you to die. This is, by the way,
[12079.71s -> 12081.71s]  it is a hardcore server. If you die
[12081.71s -> 12086.12s]  you're out. If you die
[12086.12s -> 12090.22s]  you cannot come back in. You start
[12090.22s -> 12092.22s]  at zero, you're going to age, it's going to take
[12092.22s -> 12094.22s]  ten hours. You have ten hours of time.
[12094.22s -> 12098.06s]  When you are zero,
[12098.06s -> 12101.64s]  you can't talk.
[12101.64s -> 12104.14s]  You're essentially a baby.
[12104.14s -> 12112.00s]  You can't talk.
[12112.00s -> 12117.18s]  You can't build. And you can't hold
[12117.18s -> 12121.28s]  a weapon. How could you?
[12121.28s -> 12126.91s]  And, by the way, you walk
[12126.91s -> 12128.91s]  at minus
[12128.91s -> 12130.91s]  probably, we're trying to still figure out how
[12130.91s -> 12132.91s]  fast, probably like minus a hundred percent speed.
[12132.91s -> 12138.80s]  All players
[12138.80s -> 12141.04s]  I'm going to like make this smaller.
[12141.04s -> 12149.29s]  The age from zero
[12149.29s -> 12151.66s]  to, probably like zero
[12151.66s -> 12153.66s]  to two, zero to three, is
[12153.66s -> 12155.66s]  going to take probably about twenty
[12155.66s -> 12159.37s]  minutes. Because you age
[12159.37s -> 12162.25s]  zero to a hundred. So let me
[12162.25s -> 12168.33s]  add this here. Start at zero
[12168.33s -> 12170.33s]  and die at a hundred.
[12170.33s -> 12180.19s]  At about ninety years
[12180.19s -> 12182.88s]  old, you
[12182.88s -> 12184.88s]  slow down.
[12184.88s -> 12187.82s]  You can't craft that many
[12187.82s -> 12189.82s]  materials anymore. You can't
[12189.82s -> 12191.82s]  swing a weapon as fast as you used
[12191.82s -> 12195.53s]  to. And you're probably saying
[12195.53s -> 12197.53s]  wait a minute, why are you doing this? Well
[12197.53s -> 12200.09s]  if you start at zero and can't
[12200.09s -> 12202.09s]  talk, and can't do anything
[12202.09s -> 12204.78s]  that prevents you from being
[12204.78s -> 12206.78s]  able to just try
[12206.78s -> 12208.78s]  to come kill me immediately. You could.
[12208.78s -> 12210.78s]  You could.
[12210.78s -> 12212.78s]  You can still punch.
[12212.78s -> 12214.78s]  You're just not going to do very much damage.
[12214.78s -> 12218.94s]  Good luck. By the way, if you die you can't
[12218.94s -> 12225.08s]  come back. So
[12225.08s -> 12228.41s]  I would be careful if I were you.
[12228.41s -> 12231.48s]  A baby rush.
[12231.48s -> 12233.48s]  I'm not going to tell you how to play this
[12233.48s -> 12236.04s]  game because this is an experiment.
[12236.04s -> 12238.22s]  Baby rush the castle.
[12238.22s -> 12240.22s]  Well, if you do that
[12240.22s -> 12242.22s]  just be known that
[12242.22s -> 12244.22s]  you can't come back and you are going to
[12244.22s -> 12246.22s]  get all new players.
[12246.22s -> 12248.22s]  I already wrote this. All
[12248.22s -> 12250.22s]  new players.
[12250.22s -> 12252.22s]  All new players.
[12252.22s -> 12254.22s]  I'm going to outline this.
[12254.22s -> 12256.40s]  All new players.
[12256.40s -> 12259.72s]  Start at zero. There's going
[12259.72s -> 12261.72s]  to be a separate lobby where people
[12261.72s -> 12263.72s]  can hang out. Potentially even a separate server
[12263.72s -> 12266.48s]  that you're going to connect to.
[12266.48s -> 12268.84s]  Whoever dies, the next
[12268.84s -> 12270.84s]  person in line is going to come in
[12270.84s -> 12276.80s]  that has a connected Twitch account.
[12276.80s -> 12278.80s]  So let's say that there is five hundred people in the
[12278.80s -> 12280.80s]  server and a hundred and fifty
[12280.80s -> 12282.80s]  of you decide to communicate with each other
[12282.80s -> 12284.80s]  somehow and do a baby rush.
[12284.80s -> 12286.80s]  And all of you just don't make it.
[12286.80s -> 12288.80s]  A hundred people that were next in line that have their
[12288.80s -> 12290.80s]  Twitches connected that are in the lobby will be put into
[12290.80s -> 12299.05s]  the game at zero. Do these
[12299.05s -> 12301.05s]  rules apply to you?
[12301.05s -> 12306.11s]  No. The king, which is
[12306.11s -> 12308.11s]  me, has double
[12308.11s -> 12311.12s]  health and
[12311.12s -> 12314.11s]  double armor because I'm
[12314.11s -> 12321.15s]  the fucking king. Oh, sorry.
[12321.15s -> 12323.15s]  Forgot to mention something else. Very, very,
[12323.15s -> 12325.15s]  very important. Let's put it over here.
[12325.15s -> 12327.32s]  There is a stamina
[12327.32s -> 12329.76s]  bar. You have to eat, guys.
[12329.76s -> 12331.76s]  And you have to sleep.
[12331.76s -> 12334.70s]  You have a stamina bar. It's going to be
[12334.70s -> 12339.24s]  in replace of the experience bar.
[12339.24s -> 12341.42s]  If you get to zero stamina, well
[12341.42s -> 12343.42s]  you're going to be very useless because that
[12343.42s -> 12349.95s]  means you haven't eaten. All
[12349.95s -> 12352.51s]  actions, and again,
[12352.51s -> 12354.51s]  all actions
[12354.51s -> 12356.51s]  require stamina.
[12356.51s -> 12358.88s]  That's putting a block down.
[12358.88s -> 12360.88s]  That's swinging a weapon. That's
[12360.88s -> 12363.31s]  walking. That's running.
[12363.31s -> 12368.94s]  If you do not eat,
[12368.94s -> 12376.92s]  you're not going to be able to do shit.
[12376.92s -> 12380.76s]  I have to eat, but I have
[12380.76s -> 12382.76s]  the three or four caches
[12382.76s -> 12384.76s]  of steaks in my trunk behind me.
[12384.76s -> 12391.29s]  What do I care? How are you going to eat his babies?
[12391.29s -> 12393.29s]  Don't worry.
[12393.29s -> 12403.28s]  There'll be ways to eat. Poison the
[12403.28s -> 12408.27s]  king. There is going to
[12408.27s -> 12411.08s]  be another spot.
[12411.08s -> 12413.08s]  So this is all, we'll slow down here for a second
[12413.08s -> 12416.28s]  here. When you join the
[12416.28s -> 12419.87s]  game, when you join the server,
[12419.87s -> 12421.87s]  like I said, you're going to have to connect to your Twitch, see if you have two
[12421.87s -> 12423.87s]  months up, you can come in. We're going to spend about an hour
[12423.87s -> 12425.87s]  before the stream truly
[12425.87s -> 12427.87s]  begins, just getting everybody
[12427.87s -> 12434.01s]  connected. So once everybody's
[12434.01s -> 12436.01s]  in place, and we have
[12436.01s -> 12438.01s]  commands, and we have plugins, we're just going to
[12438.01s -> 12440.01s]  keep you, we're going to keep you staying put.
[12440.01s -> 12442.96s]  Outside of these
[12442.96s -> 12445.45s]  walls is the wilderness.
[12445.45s -> 12448.78s]  Outside here, right?
[12448.78s -> 12450.78s]  Let's just like a million
[12450.78s -> 12452.78s]  meters outside.
[12452.78s -> 12455.60s]  The real important shit happens inside
[12455.60s -> 12457.60s]  the town. Outside
[12457.60s -> 12459.60s]  the town, you are free
[12459.60s -> 12461.60s]  to go get resources.
[12461.60s -> 12463.60s]  You can do whatever you want. You can go build
[12463.60s -> 12465.60s]  whatever you want. This is kind of like
[12465.60s -> 12467.60s]  out of play. But you can
[12467.60s -> 12472.65s]  use it to get resources.
[12472.65s -> 12474.65s]  We are actually still toying with the idea of having
[12474.65s -> 12476.65s]  a couple of different servers.
[12476.65s -> 12479.21s]  That the town is one server,
[12479.21s -> 12481.21s]  the wilderness is another
[12481.21s -> 12483.21s]  instance, right?
[12483.21s -> 12489.02s]  Who's going to protect the babies?
[12489.02s -> 12492.80s]  Kind of rot in the wild.
[12492.80s -> 12494.80s]  Can babies kill babies?
[12499.98s -> 12504.27s]  What you guys
[12504.27s -> 12507.08s]  are doing in this game,
[12507.08s -> 12509.08s]  remember, if I die,
[12509.08s -> 12513.12s]  it's over. You have to
[12513.12s -> 12515.12s]  remember,
[12515.12s -> 12517.12s]  these two age groups here are
[12517.12s -> 12519.12s]  really only in place to
[12519.12s -> 12521.42s]  prevent people from just
[12521.42s -> 12523.42s]  like detonating the whole server
[12523.42s -> 12527.52s]  instantly. So
[12527.52s -> 12529.52s]  if you have 10 hours to be
[12529.52s -> 12531.82s]  in the server, realistically
[12531.82s -> 12533.82s]  only about 30 or 40 minutes of that
[12533.82s -> 12535.82s]  time, if you stay alive, is
[12535.82s -> 12537.82s]  going to be at these more constrained
[12537.82s -> 12545.82s]  parts of your life. People who are
[12545.82s -> 12547.82s]  age 3 are just going to slaughter people
[12547.82s -> 12549.82s]  who come in.
[12549.82s -> 12551.82s]  Well, it's funny you say that.
[12551.82s -> 12553.82s]  Because we're also toying with the idea
[12553.82s -> 12556.12s]  of having a
[12556.12s -> 12558.12s]  tag on people's heads that kill
[12558.12s -> 12560.12s]  innocent people for no reason.
[12560.12s -> 12566.14s]  I'm the king. And I'm
[12566.14s -> 12568.14s]  going to have a bunch of kingsguard.
[12568.14s -> 12570.14s]  And a bunch of loyal people.
[12570.14s -> 12573.92s]  If there is a crime that's committed that needs
[12573.92s -> 12575.92s]  to be brought to my attention, I will go investigate
[12575.92s -> 12580.46s]  this. I'm going to have a team
[12580.46s -> 12582.46s]  of people that are going to be keeping the peace.
[12582.46s -> 12588.99s]  I'm not just going to let my kingdom
[12588.99s -> 12590.99s]  fall into total ruin. Why would
[12590.99s -> 12596.24s]  I do that? I'm going to, I will
[12596.24s -> 12598.24s]  come out and I will solve problems. I will
[12598.24s -> 12600.24s]  teleport the perpetrator into
[12600.24s -> 12602.24s]  the throne room and we will have a little
[12602.24s -> 12605.76s]  trial. Well, you're going to be
[12605.76s -> 12607.76s]  teleporting a bunch of people into that throne room
[12607.76s -> 12609.76s]  because nobody's going to stop killing
[12609.76s -> 12611.76s]  zero aged people.
[12611.76s -> 12623.02s]  It's going to be very, very fun.
[12623.02s -> 12625.02s]  For a lot of different reasons.
[12625.02s -> 12628.35s]  I kind
[12628.35s -> 12630.35s]  of want to just see how this
[12630.35s -> 12632.35s]  plays out. When is this happening on
[12632.35s -> 12636.25s]  Sunday? Do the kingsguard
[12636.25s -> 12638.25s]  age at the same rate that you do?
[12638.25s -> 12644.46s]  Yes. When I kill
[12644.46s -> 12646.46s]  your guards, will they respawn? No.
[12646.46s -> 12648.64s]  Nobody respawns.
[12648.64s -> 12651.90s]  How's it going to be streamed?
[12651.90s -> 12653.90s]  So, there's going to be a separate
[12653.90s -> 12655.90s]  mobile studio that is made
[12655.90s -> 12658.78s]  that is going to be
[12658.78s -> 12660.78s]  streaming the event
[12660.78s -> 12662.78s]  and we're going to have like three or four different
[12662.78s -> 12664.78s]  cameras, free cam flying around to
[12664.78s -> 12666.78s]  cut to, and my perspective.
[12666.78s -> 12673.76s]  Because I want to be able to see what
[12673.76s -> 12675.76s]  some of the other shit that's happening. I want you, for a viewer
[12675.76s -> 12678.57s]  perspective, right? It's more
[12678.57s -> 12680.57s]  interesting if you guys
[12680.57s -> 12682.57s]  get to see a ton of different perspectives. If you're playing
[12682.57s -> 12684.57s]  the game, sure, just you're playing the game and you're
[12684.57s -> 12686.57s]  participating in the little experiment, right?
[12686.57s -> 12688.57s]  But you won't just see
[12688.57s -> 12692.73s]  my point of view. You'll
[12692.73s -> 12694.73s]  hear me talk and I'll be
[12694.73s -> 12696.73s]  going over the things that need to be
[12696.73s -> 12701.02s]  going over with my kingdom.
[12701.02s -> 12703.58s]  How do you join? When this
[12703.58s -> 12706.01s]  server launches, like I said,
[12706.01s -> 12708.01s]  there's going to be just a little lobby that you can
[12708.01s -> 12710.64s]  just be in. You then
[12710.64s -> 12712.64s]  connect your Twitch with a separate, there's going to be a
[12712.64s -> 12714.64s]  separate website that you're going to
[12714.64s -> 12716.64s]  use, that you're going to connect your Twitch API to
[12716.64s -> 12718.64s]  it. It just pulls
[12718.64s -> 12720.64s]  how many months you've been subscribed to
[12720.64s -> 12722.64s]  my channel. That's it. Doesn't do anything else.
[12722.64s -> 12729.23s]  Can the guards betray you?
[12729.23s -> 12738.88s]  No. Jeremy,
[12738.88s -> 12741.18s]  you're trying to get my data.
[12741.18s -> 12743.18s]  No, let me be very, very clear
[12743.18s -> 12745.18s]  about something. This
[12745.18s -> 12747.36s]  is not, oh yeah,
[12747.36s -> 12749.36s]  I'm just like running a server.
[12749.36s -> 12751.72s]  There's a lot of resources
[12751.72s -> 12753.72s]  put into this to make sure it works.
[12753.72s -> 12756.41s]  There's a lot of protection,
[12756.41s -> 12758.41s]  there's a lot of servers.
[12758.41s -> 12760.41s]  It is not just
[12760.41s -> 12765.92s]  running in my basement.
[12765.92s -> 12767.92s]  This stupid experiment
[12767.92s -> 12769.92s]  is really important
[12769.92s -> 12772.41s]  to me. I don't care
[12772.41s -> 12774.41s]  if I die in the first five minutes
[12774.41s -> 12776.41s]  by falling down the fucking
[12776.41s -> 12778.91s]  stairs. I don't care.
[12778.91s -> 12782.80s]  By the way, this
[12782.80s -> 12784.80s]  first iteration
[12784.80s -> 12787.04s]  of, it's called FTK, it's called
[12787.04s -> 12789.60s]  Fuck The King, FTK. The first
[12789.60s -> 12791.60s]  iteration is very much going to be
[12791.60s -> 12793.60s]  an alpha beta.
[12793.60s -> 12801.08s]  We're just trying to see if it works.
[12801.08s -> 12803.08s]  After we do one, we'll have
[12803.08s -> 12805.45s]  a lot of, we'll have
[12805.45s -> 12810.00s]  a lot of info. I want to do
[12810.00s -> 12812.00s]  this more than once. I want to
[12812.00s -> 12814.00s]  add more stuff to it. I want to make it more interesting.
[12814.00s -> 12816.36s]  I want to add more, I want to add
[12816.36s -> 12818.36s]  like quests and shit eventually. I want to
[12818.36s -> 12820.36s]  do a bunch of random shit with this server.
[12820.36s -> 12825.23s]  And going back and forth with
[12825.23s -> 12827.23s]  some of the developers and the people that are making the
[12827.23s -> 12829.23s]  plugins and the server and everything,
[12829.23s -> 12831.23s]  they're excited too. They want to do
[12831.23s -> 12833.23s]  more stuff on top of this as well.
[12833.23s -> 12836.62s]  But the first one is just to see
[12836.62s -> 12838.62s]  if we can do it and how long
[12838.62s -> 12840.62s]  I can last and how
[12840.62s -> 12842.62s]  democratically this whole thing can
[12842.62s -> 12844.62s]  play out or not. And it's just chaos.
[12844.62s -> 12846.62s]  And 500 of you
[12846.62s -> 12848.62s]  rush the front door.
[12848.62s -> 12850.62s]  And die.
[12850.62s -> 12852.62s]  And then the next 500 people will
[12852.62s -> 12854.62s]  then know that that cannot
[12854.62s -> 12856.62s]  be accomplished.
[12856.62s -> 12858.62s]  Maybe it can. Maybe you can
[12858.62s -> 12860.62s]  sneak into the window in
[12860.62s -> 12862.62s]  my bathroom and break in and
[12862.62s -> 12864.62s]  shoot me with a bow and arrow. Which,
[12864.62s -> 12866.62s]  by the way, let's go over another thing.
[12866.62s -> 12868.62s]  I'm not even going to write this down because I can't.
[12868.62s -> 12870.62s]  I'm useless.
[12870.62s -> 12873.12s]  Weapons. Oh, Jerma, I'm just going
[12873.12s -> 12875.12s]  to make an enchantment table and I'm going to make
[12875.12s -> 12877.12s]  an enchanted bow and you're going to die in one click.
[12877.12s -> 12879.29s]  Nope. The only
[12879.29s -> 12881.29s]  available weapons are bows
[12881.29s -> 12886.80s]  and swords.
[12886.80s -> 12888.80s]  You cannot do that.
[12888.80s -> 12893.53s]  TNT is something we're still fighting
[12893.53s -> 12895.53s]  with to figure out if we're going to
[12895.53s -> 12897.53s]  do it immediately. Probably not immediately.
[12897.53s -> 12907.45s]  Just melee weapons
[12907.45s -> 12909.45s]  that make sense and ranged
[12909.45s -> 12911.45s]  weapons that make sense.
[12911.45s -> 12919.20s]  I might walk out the front door and get
[12919.20s -> 12922.78s]  exploded by a creeper. It's very
[12922.78s -> 12934.43s]  possible. Potions? Not yet.
[12934.43s -> 12936.43s]  No. Like I said, the first
[12936.43s -> 12938.43s]  stream of this is going to see
[12938.43s -> 12940.60s]  what happens when
[12940.60s -> 12942.60s]  500 plus people are told,
[12942.60s -> 12944.60s]  hey, you live in a kingdom now and there's a
[12944.60s -> 12947.29s]  king in there. Go get him.
[12947.29s -> 12951.95s]  Or don't. Or don't.
[12951.95s -> 12955.28s]  Good luck. It's going to
[12955.28s -> 12960.27s]  be fucking calamity.
[12960.27s -> 12963.34s]  Can you live in the wilderness?
[12963.34s -> 12970.64s]  Do whatever you want. Is there voice chat?
[12970.64s -> 12972.64s]  There's not going to be voice chat. That would be
[12972.64s -> 12976.41s]  impossible with 500 people.
[12976.41s -> 12978.41s]  This is very important. What Minecraft version?
[12978.41s -> 12980.65s]  The Minecraft version
[12980.65s -> 12982.65s]  is going to be 1.8.
[12982.65s -> 12988.48s]  It is not going to be on the new
[12988.48s -> 12992.89s]  Minecraft. I was told there's
[12992.89s -> 12994.89s]  a lot of, for having this many
[12994.89s -> 12999.12s]  people in a server, it's just
[12999.12s -> 13001.12s]  not possible to have like 500
[13001.12s -> 13003.12s]  to 1,000 people in the same spot.
[13003.12s -> 13006.12s]  It's just impossible.
[13006.12s -> 13010.40s]  We could have done maybe like
[13010.40s -> 13012.40s]  30 people, 50 people maybe.
[13012.40s -> 13015.98s]  What's your plan to get 500 people to sleep
[13015.98s -> 13017.98s]  at the same time? You don't have to sleep at the same time.
[13017.98s -> 13025.47s]  And also, let me, I got to make
[13025.47s -> 13027.47s]  sure that I'm saying this correctly. I think
[13027.47s -> 13029.47s]  once the server is live, it
[13029.47s -> 13031.47s]  won't matter what version you have. You'll just
[13031.47s -> 13033.47s]  connect to the server and it'll just run it
[13033.47s -> 13035.47s]  from what I've been told. So
[13035.47s -> 13037.47s]  I think it's going to be running on 1.8
[13037.47s -> 13039.47s]  but I don't think you need to have
[13039.47s -> 13042.80s]  somehow
[13042.80s -> 13044.80s]  1.8 something.
[13044.80s -> 13048.32s]  Doesn't work like that. I'm
[13048.32s -> 13053.12s]  completely wrong. Is there safe
[13053.12s -> 13056.64s]  areas? No. Can you
[13056.64s -> 13061.23s]  be guards? No.
[13061.23s -> 13063.23s]  Is chat going to be localized? Yes.
[13063.23s -> 13065.23s]  That's another thing. When you
[13065.23s -> 13067.23s]  talk, it is only going to be the
[13067.23s -> 13069.23s]  people that you are in the exact
[13069.23s -> 13071.23s]  vicinity of.
[13071.23s -> 13074.68s]  There is not a complete and total
[13074.68s -> 13078.59s]  always global chat. Can you be
[13078.59s -> 13080.59s]  promoted? Yes. I have the capability
[13080.59s -> 13082.59s]  to make anyone in the server anyone I want.
[13082.59s -> 13088.99s]  Does the hardcore death bar you from future
[13088.99s -> 13090.99s]  streams? Yes.
[13090.99s -> 13093.68s]  But, this is a very, very
[13093.68s -> 13095.68s]  large, huge in quotations
[13095.68s -> 13100.99s]  but, we're going
[13100.99s -> 13102.99s]  to see how many people
[13102.99s -> 13104.99s]  are trying to join the server.
[13104.99s -> 13109.85s]  So, let's say for instance
[13109.85s -> 13112.35s]  after we do this once or twice
[13112.35s -> 13114.65s]  it's very clear that
[13114.65s -> 13116.65s]  there are no more players that can even
[13116.65s -> 13119.15s]  queue up. That's when we can be like
[13119.15s -> 13121.15s]  alright, it's from scratch, let's do
[13121.15s -> 13123.64s]  it again. But for the first stream or
[13123.64s -> 13125.64s]  two, no, it's permanent.
[13125.64s -> 13127.82s]  Because remember, here's another thing.
[13127.82s -> 13129.82s]  I might not die in the first stream.
[13129.82s -> 13133.34s]  We keep going. We keep going.
[13133.34s -> 13136.86s]  We'll do it again next week. And
[13136.86s -> 13138.86s]  this is not a persistent server.
[13138.86s -> 13140.86s]  This is not a 24-7.
[13140.86s -> 13142.86s]  It's just on. No, no, no, this
[13142.86s -> 13144.86s]  server is only turned on when the stream
[13144.86s -> 13146.86s]  exists. Everything is
[13146.86s -> 13148.86s]  saved. Everything is locked in.
[13148.86s -> 13151.29s]  This is not a 24-hour
[13151.29s -> 13153.29s]  just Minecraft server that's going to exist. It's only
[13153.29s -> 13160.97s]  going to happen on the streams. How long
[13160.97s -> 13162.97s]  is the first stream going to be? I don't know.
[13162.97s -> 13166.24s]  It's up to, because
[13166.24s -> 13168.24s]  of how many people are involved, because remember
[13168.24s -> 13170.24s]  there's three or four cameramen.
[13170.24s -> 13172.24s]  There's two or three server
[13172.24s -> 13174.24s]  admins. And there's a lot
[13174.24s -> 13176.24s]  of people that are in a lot of moving parts.
[13176.24s -> 13178.24s]  So I would say this stream would be like
[13178.24s -> 13180.24s]  up to probably two to four hours.
[13180.24s -> 13182.24s]  It's not going to be
[13182.24s -> 13184.24s]  more than the first one. We'll do it in like
[13184.24s -> 13186.48s]  three to four hour chunks.
[13186.48s -> 13188.48s]  Potentially like I'd say up to four plus maybe
[13188.48s -> 13190.48s]  five hours total.
[13190.48s -> 13192.48s]  Because there's a lot of people involved and there's obviously
[13192.48s -> 13197.60s]  a lot of their time. So how do you
[13197.60s -> 13199.60s]  replace AFK players? That's a great question.
[13199.60s -> 13201.60s]  I'll bring that up with the, for the next
[13201.60s -> 13203.60s]  three days, this is all I'm doing.
[13203.60s -> 13206.22s]  So I, like, this is the only
[13206.22s -> 13208.22s]  thing I'm doing for the next two, three straight days until
[13208.22s -> 13210.22s]  the stream. So I will
[13210.22s -> 13212.22s]  bring that up and it will probably have a certain time limit when
[13212.22s -> 13214.22s]  they get booted and it brings another person in.
[13214.22s -> 13221.71s]  Feeling you can die in the first hour?
[13221.71s -> 13224.51s]  Possible. Very possible.
[13224.51s -> 13226.51s]  Do I die at a hundred? Yes.
[13226.51s -> 13231.37s]  I could just die in the throne
[13231.37s -> 13235.15s]  room at old age. I could
[13235.15s -> 13237.15s]  just be sitting in the throne room and be ninety-nine.
[13237.15s -> 13241.05s]  You didn't get me.
[13241.05s -> 13243.05s]  You'll never kill me. And then I'm just going to start
[13243.05s -> 13245.05s]  burning like money and food
[13245.05s -> 13248.19s]  and shit. I'm going to be buried with
[13248.19s -> 13250.49s]  the stakes. No, no, no. I don't want to give up
[13250.49s -> 13252.49s]  funny, funny fucking scenarios.
[13252.49s -> 13263.63s]  How are you, are you a
[13263.63s -> 13265.63s]  zero-year-old baby king? No.
[13265.63s -> 13267.80s]  I start, I age
[13267.80s -> 13269.80s]  slower. Not by very much, but I do
[13269.80s -> 13272.24s]  age slower. But I do
[13272.24s -> 13274.24s]  start at a normal, like
[13274.24s -> 13276.24s]  twenty, twenty-five.
[13276.24s -> 13278.24s]  Something like that. Just so I can actually move around. I'm not going to be
[13278.24s -> 13280.24s]  a baby king.
[13280.24s -> 13282.24s]  Who's going to take care of the babies?
[13282.24s -> 13284.67s]  I don't know. Maybe you.
[13284.67s -> 13286.97s]  Maybe you'll take care of the babies.
[13286.97s -> 13290.43s]  Maybe you should make that your thing
[13290.43s -> 13294.52s]  that you do. But
[13294.52s -> 13296.52s]  Jerma, we're going to kill you in five minutes.
[13296.52s -> 13298.83s]  Sure you're not just going to kill each other?
[13298.83s -> 13303.50s]  Jerma's going to die in ten minutes.
[13303.50s -> 13312.46s]  You think so?
[13312.46s -> 13314.46s]  This, I already know
[13314.46s -> 13316.46s]  it's going to happen. And I don't
[13316.46s -> 13318.46s]  even need to say it because you all know. The first
[13318.46s -> 13320.46s]  ten minutes of this is happening.
[13320.46s -> 13323.47s]  Two hundred of you are just
[13323.47s -> 13325.47s]  going to be as zero-year-olds.
[13325.47s -> 13328.67s]  Just go storm the gate. And
[13328.67s -> 13331.79s]  we, and then we just freed up
[13331.79s -> 13333.79s]  two hundred more spots on the server. So
[13333.79s -> 13335.79s]  just be aware.
[13335.79s -> 13337.79s]  You're going to zero-rush.
[13337.79s -> 13339.79s]  Maybe it'll work.
[13339.79s -> 13344.27s]  If you leave the server
[13344.27s -> 13352.33s]  or you crash, we'll use the, yeah, it's
[13352.33s -> 13354.33s]  not tied to me.
[13354.33s -> 13357.21s]  Every time we stream this, there's going
[13357.21s -> 13359.21s]  to be a couple people who are going to be running
[13359.21s -> 13361.21s]  the show in the background that are running
[13361.21s -> 13363.21s]  the server. And they can help with problems.
[13363.21s -> 13365.21s]  They can fix things that happen if I crash.
[13365.21s -> 13367.21s]  It doesn't just, if I, oh, the stream
[13367.21s -> 13369.21s]  crashed. Oh, it's over.
[13369.21s -> 13371.77s]  Like, it'll still exist.
[13371.77s -> 13373.77s]  We can pause it. I can come back.
[13373.77s -> 13375.77s]  There'll be somebody on call that's taking
[13375.77s -> 13385.63s]  care of it. If you live for ten hours
[13385.63s -> 13387.63s]  and there's three hour streams, then you can do it
[13387.63s -> 13389.63s]  for three streams. There's also,
[13389.63s -> 13392.44s]  it might
[13392.44s -> 13394.44s]  not be ten hours. We can make that whatever
[13394.44s -> 13396.88s]  we want. I can make that six,
[13396.88s -> 13398.88s]  right? You make that six, seven, five.
[13398.88s -> 13401.05s]  If a player crashes, can they
[13401.05s -> 13403.05s]  reconnect? Yes. There's going to
[13403.05s -> 13405.05s]  be a certain time frame when you can come back.
[13405.05s -> 13410.30s]  Do you have to worry about dying as a baby
[13410.30s -> 13420.73s]  from an older player? Yes.
[13420.73s -> 13428.91s]  But, just be aware,
[13428.91s -> 13430.91s]  if you are just causing
[13430.91s -> 13433.85s]  problems, it's real
[13433.85s -> 13436.54s]  easy to get rid of you.
[13436.54s -> 13438.54s]  I am going to have at least a
[13438.54s -> 13440.54s]  dozen people that are in the
[13440.54s -> 13442.54s]  best armor times two
[13442.54s -> 13445.36s]  in the whole game and are
[13445.36s -> 13447.79s]  stronger than you.
[13447.79s -> 13449.79s]  They're coming
[13449.79s -> 13458.49s]  for you. We've also,
[13458.49s -> 13460.49s]  there's also the idea
[13460.49s -> 13462.49s]  that maybe, for the
[13462.49s -> 13464.49s]  first five, the first
[13464.49s -> 13466.49s]  year of your life, maybe you're in
[13466.49s -> 13468.49s]  invincible to other players.
[13468.49s -> 13471.76s]  That's another idea that I'm
[13471.76s -> 13473.93s]  going to throw out to them. That maybe
[13473.93s -> 13475.93s]  for almost like a spawn
[13475.93s -> 13478.56s]  protection kind of way.
[13478.56s -> 13480.56s]  So the first fifteen, twenty minutes
[13480.56s -> 13482.56s]  that you're in the game, you can't be killed
[13482.56s -> 13484.56s]  by another player. You can still
[13484.56s -> 13486.56s]  die from the environment maybe, but I don't know.
[13486.56s -> 13488.56s]  We might just see what happens.
[13488.56s -> 13490.56s]  I want to do this more than once. I want to do this more than
[13490.56s -> 13492.56s]  twice. I want to do this at least
[13492.56s -> 13494.56s]  a few times. I think it's a really, really
[13494.56s -> 13496.56s]  just fun idea. I do.
[13496.56s -> 13504.17s]  Baby Rush with invincibility.
[13504.17s -> 13509.23s]  Will you be okay with people streaming
[13509.23s -> 13511.98s]  it?
[13511.98s -> 13514.86s]  I guess. I don't
[13514.86s -> 13517.42s]  see why not.
[13517.42s -> 13519.85s]  The thing about
[13519.85s -> 13521.85s]  if you were to like play and stream,
[13521.85s -> 13523.85s]  the camera angles will be
[13523.85s -> 13525.85s]  that would just be your perspective.
[13525.85s -> 13528.46s]  Yes, it's the Java
[13528.46s -> 13530.46s]  Minecraft. It's the Java Minecraft.
[13530.46s -> 13536.03s]  Not the Microsoft one.
[13536.03s -> 13538.33s]  Is there a reward for someone that kills you?
[13538.33s -> 13540.33s]  Yes, you turned off the stream.
[13540.33s -> 13544.04s]  That's your reward. If we all start as
[13544.04s -> 13546.04s]  babies, who takes care of us?
[13546.04s -> 13548.22s]  I don't know.
[13548.22s -> 13550.40s]  Ask the cavemen.
[13550.40s -> 13556.48s]  How did they do it?
[13556.48s -> 13558.48s]  How did the first man? I don't know.
[13558.48s -> 13564.56s]  Figure it out. You have to take care
[13564.56s -> 13568.46s]  of each other.
[13568.46s -> 13570.46s]  Here's another thing that I was thinking.
[13570.46s -> 13572.46s]  Remember, this is all not set in stone.
[13572.46s -> 13574.46s]  The other thing that I was thinking is
[13574.46s -> 13577.02s]  have some designated
[13577.02s -> 13579.02s]  community members
[13579.02s -> 13581.02s]  that are not just
[13581.02s -> 13583.02s]  going to kill everybody.
[13583.02s -> 13585.02s]  That can be trusted.
[13585.02s -> 13587.02s]  That will just be
[13587.02s -> 13589.02s]  like 10,
[13589.02s -> 13593.37s]  15.
[13593.37s -> 13596.32s]  And that's it. But you can still eat
[13596.32s -> 13598.32s]  and move.
[13598.32s -> 13600.32s]  Remember, when you see
[13600.32s -> 13602.32s]  like the, oh, I'm zero years old.
[13602.32s -> 13604.32s]  That's just essentially your time
[13604.32s -> 13606.32s]  in the server.
[13606.32s -> 13609.32s]  So you can still do things.
[13609.32s -> 13611.32s]  You can still move around, but you just can't talk.
[13611.32s -> 13613.32s]  It actually scrambles your
[13613.32s -> 13615.32s]  text like it does in games like
[13615.32s -> 13617.32s]  World of Warcraft. If you are a baby
[13617.32s -> 13619.32s]  and you write something for the first 20 minutes,
[13619.32s -> 13621.32s]  it literally is ineligible.
[13628.04s -> 13634.57s]  So it's basically one hour.
[13634.57s -> 13637.07s]  I would like it to be more than five hours
[13637.07s -> 13639.07s]  in server, in game, for a whole
[13639.07s -> 13641.07s]  life. Between five and ten, we're still trying to
[13641.07s -> 13650.99s]  figure it out. But there'd be a thing that hides
[13650.99s -> 13654.25s]  player name tags. Not sure
[13654.25s -> 13656.25s]  yet. Not sure yet. There's going to
[13656.25s -> 13658.25s]  be a HUD. There's going to be a little HUD
[13658.25s -> 13660.25s]  that'll show you your current
[13660.25s -> 13662.25s]  title, your current name, your
[13662.25s -> 13664.25s]  your current health. You'll
[13664.25s -> 13666.25s]  have a little HUD in the corner.
[13666.25s -> 13671.95s]  When is the server going to become available?
[13671.95s -> 13675.40s]  It is not
[13675.40s -> 13677.40s]  ready. The town
[13677.40s -> 13679.40s]  is still being built right now.
[13679.40s -> 13681.84s]  So it's not going to be ready
[13681.84s -> 13683.84s]  till the day that we do it.
[13683.84s -> 13686.46s]  But
[13686.46s -> 13688.46s]  for testing purposes,
[13688.46s -> 13691.15s]  obviously, I might
[13691.15s -> 13693.15s]  pull in some people, like a few.
[13693.15s -> 13695.15s]  Maybe like the day before
[13695.15s -> 13697.15s]  or like the day of,
[13697.15s -> 13699.39s]  like in the morning. We don't get to build?
[13699.39s -> 13702.59s]  Yes, you can. There's
[13702.59s -> 13704.59s]  a whole town that's being
[13704.59s -> 13708.49s]  built right now. It looks awesome.
[13708.49s -> 13715.15s]  It looks unbelievable. Where do you guys
[13715.15s -> 13718.41s]  see this town? Do we own property?
[13718.41s -> 13721.16s]  Not immediately.
[13721.16s -> 13723.16s]  Remember, this is a very
[13723.16s -> 13725.16s]  this whole thing is just a
[13725.16s -> 13727.16s]  alpha like 0.5.
[13727.16s -> 13729.60s]  It's very much an experiment
[13729.60s -> 13731.60s]  in work in progress right now.
[13731.60s -> 13734.16s]  What is available right now
[13734.16s -> 13736.16s]  is getting all the people there, having the
[13736.16s -> 13738.16s]  age system in place, having the
[13738.16s -> 13740.16s]  people, the amount of people that we want,
[13740.16s -> 13742.16s]  having the stamina bar in the food,
[13742.16s -> 13744.16s]  and having the town.
[13744.16s -> 13746.16s]  And having the outside.
[13746.16s -> 13748.16s]  Those of you saying, well, can I like
[13748.16s -> 13750.16s]  own property outside
[13750.16s -> 13752.16s]  the town? Yeah, this is going to be just a whole
[13752.16s -> 13754.16s]  area that's kind of just
[13754.16s -> 13756.16s]  to whatever. It's going to be, you can do
[13756.16s -> 13758.16s]  whatever you want. But it's also going to take
[13758.16s -> 13760.16s]  more materials
[13760.16s -> 13762.16s]  to build. When I say materials, you have a stamina bar,
[13762.16s -> 13764.16s]  right? So you can't just
[13764.16s -> 13766.16s]  build dirt everywhere.
[13766.16s -> 13768.16s]  You can't just, oh, I'm going to pick this up and make a
[13768.16s -> 13770.16s]  giant like dirt dick.
[13770.16s -> 13772.16s]  That's impossible because you'd have
[13772.16s -> 13777.72s]  to have stamina to build.
[13777.72s -> 13779.72s]  It costs stamina for you to place a block.
[13779.72s -> 13782.86s]  Let's just put it that way. So you guys are going to
[13782.86s -> 13784.86s]  have to work together to build houses. You can't
[13784.86s -> 13786.86s]  just make a dirt dick. It's not going to happen.
[13786.86s -> 13788.86s]  You could, I guess,
[13788.86s -> 13790.86s]  you could pick your little spot in the wilderness and make a dirt
[13790.86s -> 13792.86s]  dick. But that's going to take you
[13792.86s -> 13794.86s]  like your whole life.
[13794.86s -> 13805.79s]  Don't give them ideas.
[13805.79s -> 13807.79s]  It's worth it.
[13807.79s -> 13809.79s]  My whole life
[13809.79s -> 13811.79s]  was dedicated to making a dirt
[13811.79s -> 13813.79s]  dick.
[13813.79s -> 13815.79s]  I can rest peacefully now.
[13815.79s -> 13826.92s]  There's ideas to eventually
[13826.92s -> 13828.92s]  add. And pretty much what you see
[13828.92s -> 13831.29s]  on the screen right now
[13831.29s -> 13833.29s]  is what the stream will be
[13833.29s -> 13835.79s]  at first. Once we get one
[13835.79s -> 13837.79s]  under the belt, there's going to be so much data
[13837.79s -> 13839.79s]  that we'll have to do it
[13839.79s -> 13841.79s]  again. We'll learn
[13841.79s -> 13843.79s]  so much from the first one.
[13843.79s -> 13847.12s]  We'll just keep it moving forward.
[13847.12s -> 13849.80s]  There's nothing for us to install.
[13849.80s -> 13852.24s]  Nope. There, you do not have
[13852.24s -> 13854.24s]  to get any mods. You do not have to get
[13854.24s -> 13856.24s]  anything special. You just have to
[13856.24s -> 13864.56s]  go in the server. Entering
[13864.56s -> 13866.56s]  the server will be putting in the
[13866.56s -> 13869.05s]  server IP.
[13869.05s -> 13871.72s]  Right? Like always.
[13871.72s -> 13874.09s]  Once you get in, you will be
[13874.09s -> 13876.59s]  in a separate little lobby, which you
[13876.59s -> 13878.59s]  will then have. It isn't going to be
[13878.59s -> 13880.59s]  a separate website that's going
[13880.59s -> 13882.59s]  to generate a code for you. It's going to check
[13882.59s -> 13884.59s]  to see how many months you've been subbed
[13884.59s -> 13887.53s]  to the channel. Completely separated.
[13887.53s -> 13890.41s]  It'll see.
[13890.41s -> 13892.41s]  You'll get a code. Put it in.
[13892.41s -> 13894.41s]  Very simple.
[13894.41s -> 13899.34s]  There you go. Can we make our own kingdom
[13899.34s -> 13901.34s]  next door? Sure, but I'll just come destroy
[13901.34s -> 13905.24s]  it. Does it have to be an active
[13905.24s -> 13909.98s]  sub? Yes. If you guys
[13909.98s -> 13911.98s]  go make your own kingdom, are you going to make your own
[13911.98s -> 13914.41s]  kingdom? I don't think so. There's only
[13914.41s -> 13916.41s]  one kingdom here. Me.
[13916.41s -> 13920.12s]  I will squash this
[13920.12s -> 13922.12s]  rebellion. If you do one, I will just
[13922.12s -> 13931.60s]  squash it. We're going to rise
[13931.60s -> 13935.12s]  up. Are you though? Because
[13935.12s -> 13937.12s]  there, I'm not going to be a bad king.
[13937.12s -> 13939.68s]  I'm going to come
[13939.68s -> 13941.68s]  out and talk to the people
[13941.68s -> 13944.81s]  and there'll be events. There are going
[13944.81s -> 13946.81s]  to be events planned where, you know, we
[13946.81s -> 13948.81s]  go and check out the garden that's being built
[13948.81s -> 13953.16s]  and created. You just said
[13953.16s -> 13955.16s]  I'm going to be a very fair king.
[13955.16s -> 13957.16s]  Are you going to get poisoned? No, I will
[13957.16s -> 13959.16s]  not. There's going to be ten people in front of me that will eat
[13959.16s -> 13967.23s]  before I do. I'm going
[13967.23s -> 13969.23s]  to have a stash of a hundred steaks.
[13969.23s -> 13971.40s]  The first ten are going to be eaten
[13971.40s -> 13973.40s]  by my royal kingsguard
[13973.40s -> 13975.40s]  and then I'll eat the eleventh one
[13975.40s -> 13977.40s]  to make sure it's not poisoned.
[13977.40s -> 13986.09s]  How's sleeping going to work?
[13986.09s -> 13988.33s]  So, sleeping,
[13988.33s -> 13990.89s]  you can refill your stamina by sleeping
[13990.89s -> 13992.89s]  and also eating. You'll be
[13992.89s -> 13995.13s]  doing it mostly by eating.
[13995.13s -> 13997.13s]  But if you lie down in a bed,
[13997.13s -> 14000.91s]  you will recharge at a very fast rate.
[14000.91s -> 14002.91s]  But you have to lie there
[14002.91s -> 14004.91s]  for at least a minute or two.
[14004.91s -> 14006.91s]  You have to lie facing up to the ceiling
[14006.91s -> 14008.91s]  for like a full sixty seconds.
[14008.91s -> 14011.92s]  Potentially up to two minutes.
[14011.92s -> 14015.37s]  Just lie down
[14015.37s -> 14018.25s]  for like two years.
[14018.25s -> 14027.47s]  You have to determine what you want
[14027.47s -> 14032.14s]  to do for time. No, not everyone
[14032.14s -> 14034.14s]  has to sleep at once. It can be tied
[14034.14s -> 14036.14s]  to just the person's ID. That's not
[14036.14s -> 14039.02s]  a problem. Until we're strong enough
[14039.02s -> 14046.83s]  to kill. Just sleep your whole
[14046.83s -> 14048.83s]  life. You could do that if you wanted to.
[14048.83s -> 14050.83s]  You could spawn in
[14050.83s -> 14053.58s]  as a baby, slowly
[14053.58s -> 14055.58s]  with four or five other babies, build
[14055.58s -> 14057.58s]  a small baby house,
[14057.58s -> 14059.58s]  make a bed, and lie
[14059.58s -> 14069.05s]  in it until you die. You can
[14069.05s -> 14071.80s]  sleep at any time. It's just simply
[14071.80s -> 14073.80s]  a way to make you have to
[14073.80s -> 14076.94s]  not participate.
[14076.94s -> 14079.31s]  You know what I'm saying?
[14079.31s -> 14081.31s]  If you lie down, if a bunch of people
[14081.31s -> 14083.31s]  have to lie down for sixty seconds,
[14083.31s -> 14085.31s]  two minutes, that's not time that you're
[14085.31s -> 14087.31s]  storming the front gates
[14087.31s -> 14089.31s]  with your knives.
[14089.31s -> 14091.61s]  You've got to play by the rules.
[14091.61s -> 14093.61s]  If you have zero stamina,
[14093.61s -> 14095.61s]  you can still move around. That's fine.
[14095.61s -> 14098.11s]  You can still walk, you can still
[14098.11s -> 14100.11s]  punch, you can still grab, you can still
[14100.11s -> 14102.11s]  build. You just do it at a
[14102.11s -> 14104.11s]  times five slower rate.
[14104.11s -> 14106.41s]  You could be walking on at zero stamina
[14106.41s -> 14108.41s]  and you swing at minus two hundred percent speed.
[14108.41s -> 14117.24s]  What's the point of the server of when you die
[14117.24s -> 14119.24s]  within the first hour? That's not going to
[14119.24s -> 14121.74s]  happen. You guys don't know the things
[14121.74s -> 14124.30s]  that I know. I know a lot of things.
[14124.30s -> 14127.05s]  That's not going to happen.
[14127.05s -> 14130.44s]  There is no chance in hell
[14130.44s -> 14132.44s]  that I die in the first hour of the stream.
[14132.44s -> 14134.44s]  Not a chance in hell.
[14134.44s -> 14137.20s]  You guys are going to be babies.
[14137.20s -> 14140.78s]  What, you're going to surround me?
[14140.78s -> 14142.78s]  Five hundred babies are going to surround
[14142.78s -> 14144.96s]  the castle? That's not
[14144.96s -> 14146.96s]  going to happen. I can
[14146.96s -> 14148.96s]  see it. I could look out my window
[14148.96s -> 14150.96s]  and see
[14150.96s -> 14152.96s]  the baby zerg rush
[14152.96s -> 14167.68s]  and know what's going to happen.
[14167.68s -> 14169.68s]  Is it going to be a two beat?
[14169.68s -> 14171.68s]  I don't know what that style queue. I don't know what that means.
[14171.68s -> 14173.68s]  This, the queue system,
[14173.68s -> 14175.68s]  the server, it's being handled by
[14175.68s -> 14177.68s]  incredibly competent people.
[14177.68s -> 14180.30s]  So there, they know exactly
[14180.30s -> 14182.30s]  what they're doing. This
[14182.30s -> 14184.30s]  is not the first time they've done large
[14184.30s -> 14186.30s]  scale servers.
[14186.30s -> 14188.30s]  They have a lot of experience. So
[14188.30s -> 14190.30s]  they, I'm assuming, if it's something
[14190.30s -> 14193.24s]  that would be good,
[14193.24s -> 14197.60s]  it's there. They actually are very,
[14197.60s -> 14199.60s]  very highly qualified. We'll just put
[14199.60s -> 14208.43s]  that way. Imagine the lag.
[14208.43s -> 14210.43s]  That's another thing that we've already talked about, that we've
[14210.43s -> 14212.60s]  already figured out. There is
[14212.60s -> 14214.60s]  going to be selective rendering.
[14214.60s -> 14216.91s]  So if you are
[14216.91s -> 14218.91s]  standing in your house,
[14218.91s -> 14220.91s]  you are not going to render
[14220.91s -> 14223.72s]  what's happening at the castle
[14223.72s -> 14225.72s]  because you don't have to.
[14225.72s -> 14234.81s]  Do the kings go get fancy outfits? Of course
[14234.81s -> 14239.61s]  they do. That's default to
[14239.61s -> 14241.61s]  Minecraft. Yeah, see?
[14241.61s -> 14255.63s]  How will redstone work? I don't think there's going to be redstone.
[14255.63s -> 14264.65s]  There's actually
[14264.65s -> 14266.65s]  talk of being able to not render
[14266.65s -> 14268.65s]  people that are under two or three years
[14268.65s -> 14271.92s]  old, if the server
[14271.92s -> 14274.80s]  load gets too big. There's a lot
[14274.80s -> 14276.80s]  of stuff, and these are very powerful
[14276.80s -> 14282.94s]  servers too. Like I said,
[14282.94s -> 14284.94s]  this is, this is not,
[14284.94s -> 14286.94s]  I didn't just go to servers.com
[14286.94s -> 14289.82s]  and buy one.
[14289.82s -> 14291.82s]  They're very, very, very powerful servers.
[14291.82s -> 14300.08s]  Invisible ghost
[14300.08s -> 14302.96s]  baby rush. Is there a
[14302.96s -> 14304.96s]  currency? No. That's something that we might
[14304.96s -> 14307.64s]  want to do eventually though. Remember,
[14307.64s -> 14309.64s]  it has to work
[14309.64s -> 14311.64s]  first. It has to work.
[14311.64s -> 14313.64s]  And this was just based off of
[14313.64s -> 14315.64s]  some just stupid idea
[14315.64s -> 14317.64s]  about World of Warcraft and not doing
[14317.64s -> 14319.64s]  anything and just having people play the game around
[14319.64s -> 14322.33s]  me. And it just, it
[14322.33s -> 14325.02s]  became a stream. This is just
[14325.02s -> 14327.02s]  we, I gotta, I gotta paddle
[14327.02s -> 14329.02s]  right now. And I'm just kind of
[14329.02s -> 14331.02s]  paddling around somewhere in water that I've
[14331.02s -> 14337.61s]  never been in. I think this is
[14337.61s -> 14344.52s]  going to be a lot of fun. And expect
[14344.52s -> 14346.70s]  after the first one,
[14346.70s -> 14348.70s]  for some of the, I see a lot of people saying,
[14348.70s -> 14350.70s]  hey, what about this? What about
[14350.70s -> 14352.70s]  the currency? What about, what
[14352.70s -> 14355.64s]  are the titles going to do? In the
[14355.64s -> 14357.64s]  future we will have lots of things.
[14357.64s -> 14361.42s]  It does have a lot of potential.
[14361.42s -> 14364.17s]  Okay, I will just say this.
[14364.17s -> 14366.17s]  It will be worth,
[14366.17s -> 14368.80s]  it will be worth doing once.
[14368.80s -> 14370.80s]  Just to see what happens.
[14370.80s -> 14375.20s]  And that's worth it to me.
[14375.20s -> 14377.20s]  Regardless of how
[14377.20s -> 14379.20s]  time intensive, how many people are
[14379.20s -> 14381.20s]  involved, how much money or resources,
[14381.20s -> 14383.20s]  I think it's just worth trying. It should
[14383.20s -> 14391.26s]  be fun. I'm pogging
[14391.26s -> 14398.56s]  so fucking hard right now.
[14398.56s -> 14400.56s]  I refuse to let this die after one
[14400.56s -> 14408.49s]  attempt. What's the kingdom's
[14408.49s -> 14410.49s]  name? That's something I haven't
[14410.49s -> 14413.95s]  even thought of. I don't know.
[14413.95s -> 14418.04s]  I have to think about that.
[14418.04s -> 14422.97s]  Germacraft. We'll figure that out.
[14422.97s -> 14428.80s]  But the next thing that you need to hear
[14428.80s -> 14431.42s]  is, when Sunday
[14431.42s -> 14434.11s]  comes along, the
[14434.11s -> 14436.11s]  stream is going to be starting, I believe, at about
[14436.11s -> 14439.05s]  4pm Pacific. We
[14439.05s -> 14441.05s]  still haven't locked that down 100%, but
[14441.05s -> 14443.05s]  it doesn't really matter, because
[14443.05s -> 14445.05s]  the first
[14445.05s -> 14447.05s]  at least
[14447.05s -> 14449.68s]  two to three hours
[14449.68s -> 14451.68s]  before it, and the first hour
[14451.68s -> 14453.68s]  of the stream being live, we're
[14453.68s -> 14455.68s]  going to be getting people in position to start.
[14455.68s -> 14458.24s]  This is not going to be a case of
[14458.24s -> 14460.24s]  okay, the stream is on,
[14460.24s -> 14462.60s]  okay, let's go, get in the server, let's go.
[14462.60s -> 14465.29s]  Are you guys ready? No,
[14465.29s -> 14467.29s]  this is going to be at least an hour
[14467.29s -> 14471.84s]  of getting people in.
[14471.84s -> 14480.35s]  This is on Sunday, Sunday afternoon Pacific.
[14480.35s -> 14482.78s]  Sunday the 15th,
[14482.78s -> 14485.47s]  that's the next time you will see me live.
[14485.47s -> 14487.47s]  I will be around
[14487.47s -> 14489.47s]  in the Discord. If you are very interested
[14489.47s -> 14492.35s]  in this, hang out in the Discord
[14492.35s -> 14494.35s]  over the next couple of days, because I'm going to be
[14494.35s -> 14496.35s]  around for three days straight here.
[14496.35s -> 14498.35s]  I'll give updates, I will tell you guys
[14498.35s -> 14500.35s]  more things that are being added, maybe some
[14500.35s -> 14502.35s]  things that might have to change last second.
[14502.35s -> 14505.04s]  If you would like to keep up to date with
[14505.04s -> 14507.34s]  that, I'm just going to make another
[14507.34s -> 14509.71s]  channel. It's just going to be
[14509.71s -> 14511.71s]  FTK, and it's just going to be
[14511.71s -> 14513.71s]  just info, and if there's
[14513.71s -> 14515.71s]  any server info and stuff like that,
[14515.71s -> 14518.65s]  it'll be there. You're going to
[14518.65s -> 14522.24s]  leak the plans.
[14522.24s -> 14524.24s]  What is this?
[14524.24s -> 14527.74s]  Here's the attack plan.
[14527.74s -> 14531.20s]  Let's see what the attack plan is.
[14531.20s -> 14533.20s]  Swordsman and Archer's attack
[14533.20s -> 14535.20s]  term. Baby sword blocks retreat path.
[14535.20s -> 14543.84s]  Hold on a minute.
[14543.84s -> 14545.84s]  Let's go over this incredibly flawed
[14545.84s -> 14552.68s]  plan. What do you say? Okay, let's see.
[14552.68s -> 14561.13s]  Dermal walk path,
[14561.13s -> 14563.13s]  bait location. Swordsman are hiding
[14563.13s -> 14565.13s]  in the house as Archer is at the top.
[14565.13s -> 14567.13s]  Swordsman and Archer's attack term
[14567.13s -> 14569.13s]  of baby sword blocks retreat path and attack
[14569.13s -> 14571.13s]  run behind. Base of operation.
[14571.13s -> 14576.57s]  Yeah,
[14576.57s -> 14578.57s]  guys, do it. Do it.
[14578.57s -> 14583.36s]  Form alliances.
[14583.36s -> 14585.53s]  Make plans. Do it.
[14585.53s -> 14587.84s]  I really, really want you to.
[14587.84s -> 14593.21s]  Good luck.
[14593.21s -> 14601.66s]  You're going to need it. Dirt-dick alliance.
[14605.12s -> 14607.42s]  But, that's the plan.
[14607.42s -> 14610.24s]  Any other questions,
[14610.24s -> 14612.99s]  we will go over them in the
[14612.99s -> 14614.99s]  Discord. I just wanted to give a basic
[14614.99s -> 14618.38s]  understanding of how this is going to work. Is there a
[14618.38s -> 14620.38s]  jail? No. Not yet. Not on the first one.
[14620.38s -> 14625.05s]  Think of the first one as an
[14625.05s -> 14627.05s]  experiment, like I said before. It's
[14627.05s -> 14629.05s]  the first iteration of an alpha
[14629.05s -> 14633.34s]  essentially. And I'll see you guys
[14633.34s -> 14636.73s]  on Sunday. Good luck.
[14636.73s -> 14644.33s]  See you in the Discord possibly.
[14644.33s -> 14648.11s]  And that's going to be it for me. Be
[14648.11s -> 14650.11s]  prepared. Oh, I've been preparing
[14650.11s -> 14652.11s]  for the last three,
[14652.11s -> 14655.88s]  four weeks. You don't, what, you don't
[14655.88s -> 14658.06s]  think that I,
[14658.06s -> 14660.06s]  you don't think that I have
[14660.06s -> 14662.06s]  some tricks up
[14662.06s -> 14664.06s]  my sleeve? What, I'm just,
[14664.06s -> 14666.06s]  I'm just going to die?
[14666.06s -> 14668.06s]  You don't think I have things
[14668.06s -> 14670.06s]  in place? You don't think I
[14670.06s -> 14672.06s]  have my own plans?
[14672.06s -> 14674.06s]  You don't think I know these things?
[14674.06s -> 14676.06s]  I ain't just going to let you
[14676.06s -> 14678.06s]  walk in the front door.
[14678.06s -> 14680.06s]  I ain't going to let you just come in the
[14680.06s -> 14683.32s]  back door. Not
[14683.32s -> 14687.72s]  going to happen. Good luck.
[14687.72s -> 14689.72s]  But I'll see you on Sunday. We'll give it
[14689.72s -> 14691.72s]  a try. That's the next time you'll see
[14691.72s -> 14696.27s]  me. Thanks for hanging out for the game awards.
[14696.27s -> 14699.66s]  Let's get some music on here, huh?
[14699.66s -> 14712.01s]  He's going to play self-destruct buttons.
[14712.01s -> 14721.53s]  Maybe. Thank you for watching.
[14721.53s -> 14725.76s]  See you Sunday. 4pm Pacific.
[14725.76s -> 14728.38s]  Great Canadian Fuck Club
[14728.38s -> 14730.38s]  thanks to the five community subs right now.
[14730.38s -> 14732.38s]  There was also, I think I saw,
[14732.38s -> 14734.38s]  yeah, Great Canadian Fuck Club gave 5000
[14734.38s -> 14736.38s]  bits on top of the subs.
[14736.38s -> 14738.56s]  $50 from
[14738.56s -> 14740.56s]  Great Canadian. Jerma, King of the Andals,
[14740.56s -> 14742.56s]  The Royner, and The Short Men.
[14742.56s -> 14748.00s]  Thank you,
[14748.00s -> 14750.00s]  Great Canadian, for your massive
[14750.00s -> 14752.00s]  contribution here. Thank you.
[14752.00s -> 14754.00s]  10, 20, 15
[14754.00s -> 14756.00s]  community subs at least.
[14756.00s -> 14765.77s]  And $50.
[14765.77s -> 14769.55s]  He's short. Splard, thanks
[14769.55s -> 14771.55s]  for the five community subs. I think we got it.
[14771.55s -> 14773.55s]  Freddy Dread gave $100 at the beginning of the stream.
[14773.55s -> 14776.17s]  Huge thank you.
[14776.17s -> 14780.01s]  Sad Vega, thanks for the 300 bits.
[14780.01s -> 14782.01s]  Death Stranding's soundtrack was comparable to Hipster
[14782.01s -> 14784.01s]  Kitchen Music. My God, they are going to win
[14784.01s -> 14786.01s]  so many undeserved rewards.
[14786.01s -> 14788.64s]  What is Hipster Kitchen
[14788.64s -> 14791.52s]  Music? I don't know, Kitchen
[14791.52s -> 14794.91s]  Music was its own genre. The Dirt
[14794.91s -> 14800.48s]  Dick Alliance is coming for you.
[14800.48s -> 14804.38s]  Alright, well, fine.
[14804.38s -> 14809.82s]  Thank you, Maddie, for the
[14809.82s -> 14811.82s]  $5.30.
[14811.82s -> 14814.19s]  530 bits. Jerma, you're always going
[14814.19s -> 14816.19s]  to be my content creator of the year. There's no doubt
[14816.19s -> 14818.19s]  you make the world a brighter place. Thank you for
[14818.19s -> 14820.19s]  all the laughs. We all appreciate it more than you may think.
[14820.19s -> 14822.43s]  Love you.
[14822.43s -> 14826.27s]  Thank you, Maddie. I don't need any awards.
[14826.27s -> 14835.29s]  Appreciate that.
[14835.29s -> 14840.16s]  Thank you, Teypan,
[14840.16s -> 14842.16s]  for the 300 bits. 300 bits.
[14842.16s -> 14844.16s]  No message, just
[14844.16s -> 14846.16s]  three dollars. Thank you.
[14846.16s -> 14848.16s]  Sad Vega, thanks for 300 bits. My heart
[14848.16s -> 14850.16s]  broke hearing you say you will never play Luigi's Mansion 3.
[14850.16s -> 14853.04s]  My ADHD
[14853.04s -> 14855.04s]  and obsessive compulsive
[14855.04s -> 14857.04s]  nature makes me unable
[14857.04s -> 14863.24s]  to complete that game.
[14863.24s -> 14865.24s]  Malto, thanks for the 500 bits.
[14865.24s -> 14868.32s]  Thank you, Malto69.
[14868.32s -> 14870.32s]  Imagine a game so big it actually sells
[14870.32s -> 14872.32s]  as its own console to fit all its
[14872.32s -> 14877.82s]  content.
[14877.82s -> 14883.00s]  That would have to be...
[14883.00s -> 14885.24s]  That would have to be a very big game.
[14885.24s -> 14892.35s]  VR.
[14892.35s -> 14894.65s]  Well, the VR was only
[14894.65s -> 14896.65s]  doesn't live in your house simulator.
[14896.65s -> 14901.64s]  Thank you, Platadonius
[14901.64s -> 14903.64s]  Platadenius, thanks for the 500 bits.
[14903.64s -> 14905.64s]  Vin Diesel had to lean down to
[14905.64s -> 14907.64s]  speak into the microphone because he's tall.
[14907.64s -> 14909.64s]  Jerma, that's just how it is for people over
[14909.64s -> 14911.64s]  six feet tall. That microphone was
[14911.64s -> 14913.64s]  probably four and a half feet off the ground.
[14913.64s -> 14919.53s]  Vin Diesel is 5'10".
[14919.53s -> 14923.69s]  Okay.
[14923.69s -> 14925.69s]  Thank you, Castelion
[14925.69s -> 14928.19s]  for the 300 bits.
[14928.19s -> 14930.19s]  Hey, Jerma, I hope this TGA show, though awful,
[14930.19s -> 14932.19s]  convinces you to try Disco
[14932.19s -> 14934.19s]  Elcium in future. I'd love to see you
[14934.19s -> 14936.19s]  as a terrible degenerate detective
[14936.19s -> 14938.19s]  in this very little conflict.
[14938.19s -> 14940.19s]  Really? Well, it is not a constant
[14940.19s -> 14942.19s]  conflict. Why would I even want to play it?
[14942.19s -> 14949.87s]  I even said the name wrong.
[14949.87s -> 14954.67s]  Thank you, though. I'll have to
[14954.67s -> 14957.16s]  give it a real look.
[14957.16s -> 14959.66s]  Gnarly, thanks for the 250.
[14959.66s -> 14961.66s]  Sekiro was my game of the year, so I'm glad it won.
[14961.66s -> 14963.66s]  Also, I guess I'm the only League of Legends player
[14963.66s -> 14965.66s]  here because I'm super hyped for the new
[14965.66s -> 14967.66s]  League of Legends platformer and RPG
[14967.66s -> 14969.66s]  games, but no one else in
[14969.66s -> 14971.66s]  chat is. Still was an
[14971.66s -> 14980.94s]  underwhelming show, though.
[14980.94s -> 14982.94s]  I don't even have an opinion. I don't
[14982.94s -> 14984.94s]  play League. I don't really know the characters. I don't
[14984.94s -> 14986.94s]  connect with the world. I don't know anything about it, so.
[14986.94s -> 14991.74s]  Thank you, Nearshrew, for the five
[14991.74s -> 14995.90s]  community subs. And again,
[14995.90s -> 14997.90s]  great Canadian come in with a huge amount of money. Thank you,
[14997.90s -> 15002.76s]  Canadian. 25
[15002.76s -> 15004.76s]  Dr. Pepper, thanks for the 250 bits.
[15004.76s -> 15006.76s]  Fuck the king. That's treason.
[15006.76s -> 15008.76s]  I want to be the king's friend.
[15008.76s -> 15010.76s]  You are the exact reason
[15010.76s -> 15012.76s]  why I think people are very seriously overestimating
[15012.76s -> 15014.76s]  how quickly I'm going to die.
[15014.76s -> 15019.56s]  Remember, you've only got
[15019.56s -> 15021.56s]  like six-ish plus hours
[15021.56s -> 15023.56s]  in the server total.
[15023.56s -> 15026.00s]  You don't want to enjoy those six hours.
[15026.00s -> 15028.00s]  Six plus maybe
[15028.00s -> 15030.00s]  hours. You want to come kill you, but
[15030.00s -> 15032.00s]  if you're just going to die, you can't come back in.
[15032.00s -> 15034.00s]  You want to protect that person
[15034.00s -> 15036.00s]  that keeps that going. You want to protect
[15036.00s -> 15038.00s]  my kingdom and me.
[15038.00s -> 15040.24s]  You get to stay around.
[15040.24s -> 15046.51s]  You rush the front door in the first
[15046.51s -> 15048.51s]  20, 30 minutes of the game, then
[15048.51s -> 15050.51s]  you're just throwing away your game time
[15050.51s -> 15052.51s]  and you can't come back.
[15052.51s -> 15058.01s]  Think about it before you choose
[15058.01s -> 15069.66s]  these things. What happens if
[15069.66s -> 15071.66s]  everyone dies except the king?
[15071.66s -> 15073.90s]  It's just going to pull the next people
[15073.90s -> 15075.90s]  that are in the queue.
[15075.90s -> 15079.55s]  Let's say, because let's say there's 500 people
[15079.55s -> 15081.55s]  that are allowed in the server, and
[15081.55s -> 15083.55s]  three, four, five
[15083.55s -> 15085.55s]  thousand people all want to sign up
[15085.55s -> 15088.11s]  at the same time. They'll always just
[15088.11s -> 15090.11s]  be somebody else that can replace.
[15090.11s -> 15096.06s]  And like I said previously, if it gets to a point
[15096.06s -> 15098.06s]  where we're out of potential players,
[15098.06s -> 15100.06s]  we can wipe the slate clean
[15100.06s -> 15107.61s]  and just do it again.
[15107.61s -> 15109.61s]  If there's no more people left in the queue, then we'll just
[15109.61s -> 15116.40s]  refresh it.
[15116.40s -> 15119.02s]  We may even
[15119.02s -> 15121.02s]  it really just depends on how many people actually try.
[15121.02s -> 15123.20s]  1.8. Version of Minecraft is 1.8.
[15123.20s -> 15127.23s]  Is there going to be a queue
[15127.23s -> 15129.53s]  waiting room? Yes.
[15129.53s -> 15131.53s]  It'll be separate from the actual server.
[15131.53s -> 15143.82s]  Is it going to replace normal streams?
[15145.82s -> 15148.64s]  I don't, I mean, I don't know
[15148.64s -> 15150.64s]  what you mean by the word replace.
[15150.64s -> 15155.05s]  It's just a stream.
[15155.05s -> 15161.32s]  Is there an age limit?
[15161.32s -> 15163.32s]  A hundred, and you die.
[15163.32s -> 15168.70s]  I imagine this would be something I would want to do at least
[15168.70s -> 15170.70s]  once a week. For the first
[15170.70s -> 15173.52s]  do it three or four times and see how
[15173.52s -> 15178.64s]  good. Even if I die.
[15178.64s -> 15181.26s]  Do you age when offline? No.
[15181.26s -> 15184.51s]  You do not.
[15184.51s -> 15186.51s]  And we're going to make sure,
[15186.51s -> 15188.51s]  just to add to what we were saying before,
[15188.51s -> 15190.51s]  in that initial queue lobby system,
[15190.51s -> 15192.51s]  I'm going to make sure that there are a
[15192.51s -> 15194.51s]  shitload of rules that are just
[15194.51s -> 15196.51s]  put there for you to read
[15196.51s -> 15198.51s]  and kind of
[15198.51s -> 15200.51s]  compress them in at your own pace.
[15200.51s -> 15206.78s]  What happens when I die?
[15206.78s -> 15208.78s]  When I die, it's over and we do it again next week.
[15208.78s -> 15213.20s]  Now there are some
[15213.20s -> 15215.20s]  rules where if I die certain ways,
[15215.20s -> 15217.20s]  then I would just
[15217.20s -> 15219.20s]  come back and reset it. Because
[15219.20s -> 15221.63s]  if there is a weird
[15221.63s -> 15223.63s]  disconnect issue, or if something happens
[15223.63s -> 15225.63s]  to my game, or if there's an actual
[15225.63s -> 15227.63s]  glitch or something and I shouldn't have died,
[15227.63s -> 15229.63s]  then I come back.
[15229.63s -> 15232.43s]  If I disconnect
[15232.43s -> 15234.43s]  and I die because I was disconnected for too long,
[15234.43s -> 15236.43s]  then no, the king isn't dead because he
[15236.43s -> 15246.35s]  DC'd. He's going to get
[15246.35s -> 15248.35s]  crystal killed. No, there's no crystals.
[15248.35s -> 15251.42s]  There's no crystals.
[15251.42s -> 15253.42s]  There's only bows and swords
[15253.42s -> 15255.42s]  and small melee weapons. You can't
[15255.42s -> 15257.42s]  create magic fucking potion
[15257.42s -> 15268.04s]  bombs. We're going to
[15268.04s -> 15278.54s]  drop an anvil on him. Summon
[15278.54s -> 15280.54s]  a wither on him. That doesn't
[15280.54s -> 15283.10s]  exist. Only
[15283.10s -> 15285.10s]  creepers, skeletons, and zombies
[15285.10s -> 15287.10s]  are the only
[15287.10s -> 15289.10s]  enemies that will exist in the world.
[15289.10s -> 15293.39s]  No endermen,
[15293.39s -> 15295.39s]  no magicians,
[15295.39s -> 15297.39s]  no teleporting monsters. Oh yeah, spiders,
[15297.39s -> 15299.95s]  yes, yes, yes. Just the
[15299.95s -> 15301.95s]  basic enemies that don't have
[15301.95s -> 15303.95s]  a special mechanic
[15303.95s -> 15305.95s]  that instantly kills you in shit.
[15305.95s -> 15309.92s]  None of that. Because we don't give a shit
[15309.92s -> 15312.60s]  about that anyways. It's us
[15312.60s -> 15314.60s]  that we care about, not what monsters
[15314.60s -> 15322.86s]  are spawnable. Let's keep going though.
[15322.86s -> 15327.40s]  And again, questions,
[15327.40s -> 15330.22s]  comments. I'm going to be around
[15330.22s -> 15332.22s]  all day for the next few days
[15332.22s -> 15334.22s]  jumping back and forth. I'll be
[15334.22s -> 15336.22s]  in the discord. I'll make a separate channel. We can talk.
[15336.22s -> 15339.10s]  Go check it out.
[15339.10s -> 15342.56s]  I want a graffiti of your castle. We'll give you buckets.
[15342.56s -> 15349.72s]  Probably not immediately.
[15349.72s -> 15351.72s]  But thank you gooberry juice.
[15351.72s -> 15354.99s]  Why am I ruling a city of just babies?
[15354.99s -> 15356.99s]  Whose babies are we? Did you
[15356.99s -> 15358.99s]  kidnap us? Are you employing babies?
[15358.99s -> 15363.47s]  No, it's not. It's just
[15363.47s -> 15365.47s]  the time that you're in the server.
[15365.47s -> 15367.47s]  And it's in place
[15367.47s -> 15369.47s]  to prevent
[15369.47s -> 15371.47s]  immediate griefing.
[15371.47s -> 15373.84s]  Of the immediate nature.
[15373.84s -> 15376.01s]  I spawn, turn,
[15376.01s -> 15378.01s]  and kill the guy
[15378.01s -> 15380.01s]  standing next to me in five seconds
[15380.01s -> 15386.60s]  of spawning. That's why it's
[15386.60s -> 15391.85s]  there. It's battle royale.
[15391.85s -> 15393.85s]  I don't want this to turn into a br.
[15393.85s -> 15395.85s]  I don't want this to be baby br.
[15395.85s -> 15400.59s]  The first 10 to 20 minutes
[15400.59s -> 15402.59s]  of your time in the game, you're almost
[15402.59s -> 15412.44s]  100% useless.
[15412.44s -> 15415.39s]  This is just br. Kind of.
[15415.39s -> 15419.29s]  Thank you sly161 for the
[15419.29s -> 15421.29s]  250. Really looking forward to this minecraft stream.
[15421.29s -> 15423.29s]  Let me know if you need a royal food taste tester.
[15423.29s -> 15430.40s]  Yeah, we just gotta get one off the ground
[15430.40s -> 15432.40s]  first. And then this can progress
[15432.40s -> 15434.40s]  in a million ways.
[15434.40s -> 15436.40s]  Hey, Phil White, thanks for the thousand bits, Phil.
[15436.40s -> 15438.40s]  I'm really excited to see what I can
[15438.40s -> 15440.40s]  do to serve my king till I'm old of age.
[15440.40s -> 15442.40s]  But in reality, I'm probably
[15442.40s -> 15444.40s]  just going to be one of the bludgeoned
[15444.40s -> 15446.40s]  babies during the dark age.
[15453.69s -> 15455.69s]  Alright, let's talk about
[15455.69s -> 15458.06s]  something else real quick.
[15458.06s -> 15460.36s]  The first few hundred people
[15460.36s -> 15462.36s]  that come into the server,
[15462.36s -> 15464.36s]  you're the pioneers.
[15464.36s -> 15466.36s]  It is the dark times. It is the pioneering
[15466.36s -> 15468.36s]  stage of this game.
[15468.36s -> 15471.37s]  Because you
[15471.37s -> 15474.64s]  are the first. Whoever
[15474.64s -> 15476.64s]  comes after you
[15476.64s -> 15478.64s]  is going to have seen what happened
[15478.64s -> 15481.90s]  to you. And they
[15481.90s -> 15483.90s]  are going to have to maybe change their game plan
[15483.90s -> 15489.21s]  a little. Everyone in that first
[15489.21s -> 15492.99s]  wave, I don't know
[15492.99s -> 15497.02s]  what's going to happen. It is not going to be
[15497.02s -> 15499.26s]  a persistent server. We're going
[15499.26s -> 15501.26s]  to save state the server when the stream turns off
[15501.26s -> 15503.26s]  and turn it on the next time.
[15503.26s -> 15516.76s]  Are there going to be secrets?
[15516.76s -> 15520.16s]  Yeah, I, yes, yes.
[15520.16s -> 15522.16s]  I want to, eventually,
[15522.16s -> 15524.16s]  this is all eventually stuff.
[15524.16s -> 15527.10s]  I want to add little missions that people
[15527.10s -> 15530.04s]  can go on. Any way
[15530.04s -> 15536.25s]  that I can distract you.
[15536.25s -> 15540.09s]  This is called Fuck the King. But what
[15540.09s -> 15542.09s]  if things are more interesting than
[15542.09s -> 15546.89s]  Fuck the King? We'll see.
[15546.89s -> 15550.99s]  Distracting us from the
[15550.99s -> 15559.31s]  slaughter. Hey Sad Vega, thanks
[15559.31s -> 15561.31s]  again for the thousand bits. I cannot wait to watch
[15561.31s -> 15563.31s]  this shit show play out. Here's
[15563.31s -> 15565.31s]  some more bits to the cause. Hope when
[15565.31s -> 15567.31s]  I can get out on this. Do you plan to do other games
[15567.31s -> 15569.31s]  for FTK?
[15569.31s -> 15571.31s]  I'd love to see a
[15571.31s -> 15575.08s]  Conan version. The idea
[15575.08s -> 15577.08s]  is there. Minecraft was just
[15577.08s -> 15579.08s]  the easiest to have a bunch of people in.
[15579.08s -> 15582.35s]  You're aware this is going to be an
[15582.35s -> 15585.36s]  unmitigated disaster, correct?
[15585.36s -> 15588.17s]  Yeah, I wouldn't have this any other way.
[15588.17s -> 15594.57s]  That's sort of intentional,
[15594.57s -> 15596.57s]  I think. I think that's part of the plan.
[15596.57s -> 15602.01s]  If it goes completely smoothly
[15602.01s -> 15604.01s]  and it's
[15604.01s -> 15606.25s]  almost unexpected at this point.
[15606.25s -> 15611.24s]  All babies move north to build
[15611.24s -> 15613.24s]  a dirt dick city. We will create an opposing civilization.
[15613.24s -> 15615.24s]  Gain strength, improving our weapons
[15615.24s -> 15617.24s]  and armor. Then we will come commence
[15617.24s -> 15619.24s]  the assault on the kingdom.
[15619.24s -> 15624.04s]  You're going to tell what your plan is.
[15624.04s -> 15630.24s]  Again,
[15630.24s -> 15632.24s]  I don't know what you guys are doing.
[15632.24s -> 15634.24s]  There's going to be a bunch of cameras that we're
[15634.24s -> 15636.24s]  cutting to that are showing the world.
[15636.24s -> 15638.24s]  Zooming in on stuff, seeing any interesting
[15638.24s -> 15640.24s]  thing happening in the town or outside in the wilderness.
[15640.24s -> 15642.24s]  I don't know those things. I'm
[15642.24s -> 15644.41s]  playing the game with you.
[15644.41s -> 15647.42s]  If you guys made a new civilization
[15647.42s -> 15649.42s]  that I didn't know about,
[15649.42s -> 15651.42s]  how would I ever know it existed in the first place?
[15651.42s -> 15654.11s]  If I find out about it,
[15654.11s -> 15670.36s]  oh, you're fucked.
[15670.36s -> 15673.12s]  Is the town destructible?
[15673.12s -> 15675.12s]  I don't think so.
[15675.12s -> 15677.12s]  Not immediately.
[15677.12s -> 15680.12s]  I think certain things can be
[15680.12s -> 15682.30s]  destroyed.
[15682.30s -> 15684.30s]  We're not sure yet. We're trying to see how that would all work.
[15684.30s -> 15688.27s]  I don't think you can
[15688.27s -> 15690.27s]  build in the city.
[15690.27s -> 15692.70s]  We decided to do that to keep it
[15692.70s -> 15694.70s]  pretty clear.
[15694.70s -> 15696.70s]  The out of bounds area
[15696.70s -> 15699.39s]  is more designed for you to kind of make
[15699.39s -> 15701.39s]  your own little houses and have your own little communities
[15701.39s -> 15704.84s]  and stuff.
[15704.84s -> 15706.84s]  The actual town with the castles
[15706.84s -> 15708.84s]  and the little shops and the walkways,
[15708.84s -> 15710.84s]  that's more for
[15710.84s -> 15713.34s]  participating in the game.
[15713.34s -> 15721.66s]  What does the king do? Whatever I want.
[15721.66s -> 15725.88s]  Survive. Exist.
[15725.88s -> 15727.88s]  Participate.
[15727.88s -> 15729.88s]  Play. Engage.
[15729.88s -> 15735.56s]  All things.
[15735.56s -> 15737.56s]  We're talking about the capital.
[15737.56s -> 15743.26s]  To give you an idea,
[15743.26s -> 15745.26s]  the actual capital, the town,
[15745.26s -> 15747.26s]  is I believe
[15747.26s -> 15750.91s]  2000 by 2000.
[15750.91s -> 15752.91s]  And then outside of that is a much larger
[15752.91s -> 15771.77s]  area. It's pretty big.
[15771.77s -> 15773.77s]  I just want to make a house and live with the Germanites.
[15773.77s -> 15780.56s]  I don't think that many
[15780.56s -> 15782.56s]  players can play on that, on your idea.
[15782.56s -> 15784.56s]  It is.
[15784.56s -> 15790.70s]  Like I said, the people that are running
[15790.70s -> 15792.70s]  this have a ton of experience
[15792.70s -> 15794.70s]  with very large scale servers.
[15794.70s -> 15805.13s]  And there are plans for us
[15805.13s -> 15807.13s]  to beat the ever living
[15807.13s -> 15809.13s]  shit out of these servers
[15809.13s -> 15811.13s]  before we even try to have any players
[15811.13s -> 15813.13s]  come on them. So there are things we're going to
[15813.13s -> 15816.33s]  be doing. And somebody just kind
[15816.33s -> 15818.33s]  of wrote it, this is the stress
[15818.33s -> 15820.76s]  test. Right.
[15820.76s -> 15835.04s]  That's also true. Am I gonna play
[15835.04s -> 15837.04s]  a game? No, not tonight. This is
[15837.04s -> 15840.24s]  the end of the stream here. I'm
[15840.24s -> 15842.24s]  literally, I'm literally
[15842.24s -> 15844.24s]  I'm gonna get off stream and just go
[15844.24s -> 15846.24s]  right back to what I was doing before the stream started.
[15846.24s -> 15851.42s]  Shitty viewbot, thanks for the 300 bits.
[15851.42s -> 15853.42s]  I'm buying and installing Minecraft for the first time
[15853.42s -> 15855.42s]  just for this occasion. You better not
[15855.42s -> 15857.72s]  fuck this up.
[15857.72s -> 15862.65s]  Jesus. Smelly boy, thanks for the
[15862.65s -> 15864.65s]  250. If I make a nice
[15864.65s -> 15866.65s]  Minecraft farm, will the king come out and
[15866.65s -> 15868.65s]  look at it and tell me how good of a farmer I am?
[15868.65s -> 15872.17s]  Probably.
[15872.17s -> 15874.17s]  Better not have any landmines under the corn.
[15874.17s -> 15876.17s]  I'll be checking.
[15876.17s -> 15885.13s]  He's gonna destroy it.
[15885.13s -> 15889.36s]  Oh man.
[15889.36s -> 15891.36s]  Hey, permanent marks, thanks for the 250. Can I
[15891.36s -> 15893.36s]  exchange these bits for bald coin currency in
[15893.36s -> 15896.68s]  Minecraft? No, I'm sorry.
[15896.68s -> 15899.05s]  Gromicus, thanks for the 300
[15899.05s -> 15901.05s]  bits. Hey, Jerma, my little nephew Tucker is your
[15901.05s -> 15903.05s]  biggest fan. Can you please shout him out as
[15903.05s -> 15919.42s]  Tucker?
[15919.42s -> 15923.96s]  It's, there's a
[15923.96s -> 15925.96s]  I think this is a different language. I don't know what
[15925.96s -> 15930.12s]  is it. I don't know. Is this
[15930.12s -> 15935.44s]  He's searching right
[15935.44s -> 15940.94s]  now what this is. It says
[15940.94s -> 15942.94s]  please shout him out as
[15942.94s -> 15944.94s]  this the this.
[15944.94s -> 15951.28s]  Why can't I, I can't. Okay, let me see who this is.
[15951.28s -> 15965.16s]  This the this.
[15965.16s -> 15967.16s]  He can't. Alright, it's T
[15967.16s -> 15969.16s]  T-U-C-E
[15969.16s -> 15971.16s]  space
[15971.16s -> 15981.52s]  What's that? And then
[15981.52s -> 15984.27s]  D-D-E
[15984.27s -> 15990.09s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. What is that? What is that?
[15990.09s -> 15999.24s]  Why you guys, why you guys writing that?
[15999.24s -> 16007.18s]  Why you guys writing that? Okay, yep.
[16007.18s -> 16011.60s]  Thank you Gromicus for the 300 bits.
[16011.60s -> 16014.92s]  You see those questions, people write in the
[16014.92s -> 16016.92s]  question marks, what's he talking about? What's he doing?
[16016.92s -> 16021.72s]  You understand.
[16021.72s -> 16027.23s]  Thank you Panda Poploin for the
[16027.23s -> 16029.23s]  500 bits. I made a YouTube playlist of
[16029.23s -> 16031.23s]  all Jerma videos and streams and called it JermaTV.
[16031.23s -> 16033.23s]  It's got
[16033.23s -> 16035.23s]  805 videos
[16035.23s -> 16037.23s]  and a total run time length of
[16037.23s -> 16039.23s]  2916 hours
[16039.23s -> 16044.35s]  or 121
[16044.35s -> 16046.35s]  days. If you were to
[16046.35s -> 16048.35s]  start that playlist as it is now and
[16048.35s -> 16050.35s]  leave it running, it would finish on April
[16050.35s -> 16052.35s]  11th, 2020.
[16052.35s -> 16056.83s]  Holy shit.
[16056.83s -> 16058.83s]  That's an interesting bunch of facts here.
[16058.83s -> 16064.97s]  3000 hours
[16064.97s -> 16066.97s]  pretty much. Well, here it is if anyone's curious.
[16066.97s -> 16069.66s]  Just start that and then
[16069.66s -> 16071.66s]  finish it on the cyberpunk release day.
[16071.66s -> 16077.74s]  Yeah, that's right.
[16077.74s -> 16083.23s]  Just in time.
[16083.23s -> 16085.23s]  Thank you that Panda. That's actually
[16085.23s -> 16087.23s]  really cool. I've never seen
[16087.23s -> 16089.23s]  that data presented to me before.
[16089.23s -> 16092.11s]  Interesting to think about that.
[16092.11s -> 16094.11s]  121 and a half days
[16094.11s -> 16096.11s]  of video footage.
[16096.11s -> 16103.45s]  Very cool.
[16103.45s -> 16105.45s]  Socktrot, thanks for 500 bits. Please help.
[16105.45s -> 16107.45s]  I don't know what Pog or Jebaited is and no
[16107.45s -> 16109.45s]  one will tell me. I can help you.
[16109.45s -> 16111.45s]  Pog is
[16111.45s -> 16113.45s]  holy shit and Jebaited is
[16113.45s -> 16117.55s]  we got him laughing.
[16117.55s -> 16122.35s]  That's all you need to know. Apple Shift
[16122.35s -> 16124.97s]  thanks for the 250. Hey man,
[16124.97s -> 16126.97s]  today I quit my shitty job, which is kind of bittersweet
[16126.97s -> 16128.97s]  since I'll miss my coworkers.
[16128.97s -> 16130.97s]  But hey, here's 250 to
[16130.97s -> 16132.97s]  new beginnings. If I also be able to catch
[16132.97s -> 16134.97s]  more streams now, which is great.
[16134.97s -> 16136.97s]  PS, I've got to go to a thing on Sunday
[16136.97s -> 16138.97s]  so I won't be able to make the Minecraft stream.
[16138.97s -> 16140.97s]  But I'll be there for the next one for sure.
[16140.97s -> 16142.97s]  Godspeed, good sir. Best of
[16142.97s -> 16144.97s]  luck to you. Best of luck to you.
[16144.97s -> 16147.72s]  Seems like a pretty major change.
[16147.72s -> 16151.36s]  Best of luck to you.
[16151.36s -> 16159.23s]  Godspeed to you as well.
[16159.23s -> 16162.49s]  Thanks for the 250. Let's hope you
[16162.49s -> 16164.49s]  start something else soon here.
[16164.49s -> 16166.92s]  Something that you're more
[16166.92s -> 16170.76s]  happy with. Thanks again for the 250.
[16170.76s -> 16174.60s]  CadBTV
[16174.60s -> 16176.60s]  thanks for the 500 bits. I cannot wait to cut down
[16176.60s -> 16178.60s]  murderous babies in defense of my king.
[16178.60s -> 16182.06s]  Yes, you have to protect me at
[16182.06s -> 16187.18s]  all costs. Murderous
[16187.18s -> 16197.55s]  babies. This streamer
[16197.55s -> 16201.20s]  is fucked. Hey, the Dinkster.
[16201.20s -> 16203.20s]  Thanks for the 500 bits. I like this
[16203.20s -> 16205.82s]  man. I'm happy you do.
[16205.82s -> 16209.53s]  Thank you. That's
[16209.53s -> 16214.72s]  the end, guys. No, it's not.
[16214.72s -> 16216.72s]  I forgot about the credits. What am I thinking?
[16216.72s -> 16226.12s]  I'm too caught up with all the other stuff going on.
[16226.12s -> 16229.64s]  Ow, ow, ow.
[16229.64s -> 16237.13s]  Holy shit, there were a lot of subs.
[16237.13s -> 16239.13s]  I'm looking over at how
[16239.13s -> 16241.13s]  many people subbed today. That's a lot.
[16241.13s -> 16245.87s]  It's because of the server.
[16245.87s -> 16247.87s]  Yeah, but you, there's no, you need
[16247.87s -> 16250.30s]  to be subbed for, for the first
[16250.30s -> 16252.30s]  one, you have to be subbed for two months.
[16252.30s -> 16256.65s]  That might pull back
[16256.65s -> 16262.41s]  when we do another one. Are there going to be baby
[16262.41s -> 16264.41s]  player models or are we just going to be the same size?
[16264.41s -> 16266.41s]  I believe it's going to be a different
[16266.41s -> 16268.97s]  model for the first
[16268.97s -> 16270.97s]  30, 40 minutes of your life.
[16270.97s -> 16278.01s]  That was still tentative when we talked earlier,
[16278.01s -> 16282.68s]  so I'm not sure. People didn't realize
[16282.68s -> 16284.68s]  the event was in three days.
[16284.68s -> 16300.04s]  Two months in a row or total? Two months in a
[16300.04s -> 16304.20s]  row. Yeah, I had that on,
[16304.20s -> 16306.20s]  I had that on screen. I had that on screen
[16306.20s -> 16308.20s]  for like 40 minutes.
[16308.20s -> 16310.20s]  They said two plus months
[16310.20s -> 16314.49s]  in a row.
[16314.49s -> 16330.67s]  Barely made it.
[16330.67s -> 16332.67s]  Did it have to be an active sub?
[16332.67s -> 16335.42s]  Yeah, remember, the whole purpose
[16335.42s -> 16337.42s]  of doing it, we've talked about it
[16337.42s -> 16339.42s]  three or four times already here.
[16339.42s -> 16341.42s]  The point of having it be two plus
[16341.42s -> 16343.42s]  subs is because if somebody
[16343.42s -> 16345.42s]  catches the stream
[16345.42s -> 16347.42s]  and they say, oh
[16347.42s -> 16349.42s]  wait, you're telling me I can just,
[16349.42s -> 16351.42s]  I could pay five dollars
[16351.42s -> 16353.42s]  and try to ruin a server?
[16353.42s -> 16356.36s]  That's the point.
[16356.36s -> 16358.36s]  To make it so nobody
[16358.36s -> 16360.36s]  can, at least on the first
[16360.36s -> 16362.73s]  one, it's a preventative measure.
[16362.73s -> 16370.80s]  You know what I'm saying? They need to pay
[16370.80s -> 16372.80s]  ten dollars for two
[16372.80s -> 16375.80s]  straight months. So
[16375.80s -> 16377.80s]  good, alright. In two months
[16377.80s -> 16380.56s]  from now, if you
[16380.56s -> 16382.56s]  wanted to pay five bucks and try
[16382.56s -> 16390.04s]  to ruin the server,
[16390.04s -> 16392.04s]  we're also still working on that too.
[16392.04s -> 16399.13s]  It just had to be in place.
[16399.13s -> 16401.13s]  It's just too, it's too exploitable.
[16401.13s -> 16403.13s]  It just is, I really didn't want to do it
[16403.13s -> 16417.15s]  but it had to be done.
[16417.15s -> 16419.15s]  I honestly would have done six months.
[16419.15s -> 16422.48s]  I think that's too much.
[16422.48s -> 16430.54s]  Guys, remember,
[16430.54s -> 16432.54s]  the subs have to exist
[16432.54s -> 16434.54s]  and I'm not even sure there's that many
[16434.54s -> 16436.54s]  six month straight subs.
[16436.54s -> 16447.10s]  At that point it would be six months total.
[16447.10s -> 16450.62s]  But I'm not sure,
[16450.62s -> 16452.62s]  it might be hard to pull that
[16452.62s -> 16455.37s]  data. But as it stands right now
[16455.37s -> 16457.37s]  it's just, you have to have been subbed for two
[16457.37s -> 16459.37s]  months. Like the last
[16459.37s -> 16469.16s]  sixty days essentially. I'm a
[16469.16s -> 16471.16s]  seventeen month sub repeat sub but it doesn't
[16471.16s -> 16473.16s]  count because it's prime?
[16473.16s -> 16482.62s]  That's not true. Yeah,
[16482.62s -> 16484.62s]  of course, yeah, prime subs count. Of course they do.
[16484.62s -> 16492.68s]  Yeah, yeah, no,
[16492.68s -> 16494.68s]  prime counts.
[16494.68s -> 16497.82s]  You just had to have been subscribed.
[16497.82s -> 16499.82s]  It doesn't, it's not.
[16499.82s -> 16507.42s]  Yeah, that's fine. Uh oh, the babies
[16507.42s -> 16512.28s]  have doubled. So if it says my
[16512.28s -> 16514.28s]  current streak is nine months even though I missed
[16514.28s -> 16516.28s]  my last sub by a few days, I'm fine.
[16516.28s -> 16519.04s]  Yeah, it should be fine. It's just
[16519.04s -> 16521.04s]  pulling what Twitch is reporting
[16521.04s -> 16533.13s]  out, right? The streak window
[16533.13s -> 16535.13s]  is like forty days.
[16535.13s -> 16537.13s]  Yeah, so that's fine.
[16537.13s -> 16544.81s]  People are gonna be really salty
[16544.81s -> 16547.63s]  in chat when they die.
[16547.63s -> 16549.63s]  Yeah, but that's kind of inevitable though.
[16549.63s -> 16551.63s]  Alright, look.
[16551.63s -> 16556.09s]  You're, look,
[16556.09s -> 16558.09s]  listen, you're gonna die.
[16558.09s -> 16560.09s]  Okay? It's just
[16560.09s -> 16562.27s]  gonna happen. You're
[16562.27s -> 16564.27s]  gonna die. If you join
[16564.27s -> 16566.27s]  the server, you're
[16566.27s -> 16568.27s]  dead. If you're
[16568.27s -> 16570.27s]  maybe not, but you have to
[16570.27s -> 16572.27s]  go in with
[16572.27s -> 16574.27s]  wow, really? No, I'm just saying
[16574.27s -> 16576.64s]  this is chaos.
[16576.64s -> 16578.64s]  This is, you
[16578.64s -> 16580.64s]  can't go into the server and be like,
[16580.64s -> 16582.64s]  I can't wait to live a long, fruitful life
[16582.64s -> 16584.64s]  in here. It's gonna be anarchy.
[16584.64s -> 16586.94s]  It's gonna be controlled anarchy.
[16586.94s -> 16588.94s]  But it's,
[16588.94s -> 16590.94s]  I can't guarantee you that you'll last
[16590.94s -> 16592.94s]  ten seconds or you'll last five
[16592.94s -> 16595.82s]  hours. I don't know. I don't
[16595.82s -> 16601.84s]  know. You need to have a grave
[16601.84s -> 16603.84s]  keeper for all the deaths.
[16603.84s -> 16609.28s]  So I hope you
[16609.28s -> 16611.28s]  don't get upset if
[16611.28s -> 16613.28s]  you spawn in and within twenty
[16613.28s -> 16615.28s]  minutes you haven't been fed
[16615.28s -> 16617.28s]  and somebody kills you.
[16617.28s -> 16619.28s]  I'm sorry.
[16619.28s -> 16628.11s]  I'm gonna do my best to run the kingdom
[16628.11s -> 16632.72s]  as well as I can.
[16632.72s -> 16634.72s]  And that's, if you're watching
[16634.72s -> 16636.72s]  the stream, I know, oh,
[16636.72s -> 16638.72s]  I wish I could participate, but it might
[16638.72s -> 16640.72s]  even be more fun if you just watch.
[16640.72s -> 16643.34s]  This is gonna be an absolute joke
[16643.34s -> 16645.52s]  of the stream. Potentially more than
[16645.52s -> 16654.54s]  three or four times. See you Sunday,
[16654.54s -> 16658.19s]  though. Join the Discord. There'll be a channel
[16658.19s -> 16662.41s]  there soon about this stream.
[16662.41s -> 16666.88s]  Have fun, because that's all I care about.
[16666.88s -> 16689.32s]  See you soon.
