[1012.54s -> 1017.26s]  Uh, all right. Yeah. No, no, we're good moving on to symbols. Okay, let's move on. Let's move on. All right
[1017.50s -> 1019.50s]  symbols the the symbols with like the
[1020.06s -> 1026.46s]  Omega symbol thing that I couldn't do. Okay. Okay. Okay. Just just just tell me how they mirrored k mirrored k. Okay
[1026.94s -> 1031.42s]  Uh three that somebody fell asleep in the middle of doing like a three that they they fucked up at the end
[1032.46s -> 1034.46s]  Okay, um a
[1034.62s -> 1036.30s]  uh
[1036.30s -> 1039.05s]  a um
[1039.05s -> 1042.73s]  the a big a bum a big a bum with like a
[1043.53s -> 1045.13s]  comma at the top
[1045.13s -> 1047.45s]  Does it look like a like a bum scrote?
[1048.33s -> 1050.33s]  Yes. Okay a ball sack
[1050.73s -> 1052.73s]  Okay, i'm on board now
[1054.82s -> 1060.34s]  Okay, uh, and then the last one is is a uh looks almost like the like a currency symbol
[1060.66s -> 1064.26s]  It's like a uh, it's like a uh, it's it's like a currency symbol
[1064.82s -> 1066.82s]  It's like a upside down v
[1067.06s -> 1068.66s]  It's like a
[1068.66s -> 1070.66s]  It's got like a line at the top
[1070.66s -> 1074.90s]  It's like a triangle triangle triangle with like a little thing on top
[1076.34s -> 1078.34s]  Triangle with a little okay. Okay
[1078.92s -> 1080.92s]  It looks like a we like a currency
[1082.04s -> 1086.68s]  It's a triangle. It's got like a little tail through on the right side. It's like a triangle without a bottom
[1086.92s -> 1088.92s]  It's just like upside down. It's like upside down v
[1090.15s -> 1092.31s]  Are you talking about the lambda symbol?
[1094.06s -> 1097.35s]  Yes
[1097.35s -> 1099.13s]  All right. Um
[1099.13s -> 1101.13s]  Well, uh, you will be going, uh
[1102.55s -> 1104.73s]  ball sack
[1104.73s -> 1106.73s]  Good weird x
[1106.73s -> 1110.33s]  Okay, he fell asleep on the three
[1110.89s -> 1111.93s]  Okay
[1111.93s -> 1116.49s]  And dumb fuck has never played half life. All right. Yeah dumb. Fuck. Oh my god. It's the half life symbol
[1118.86s -> 1123.10s]  Okay, we got a button. So we have a button. I just it's a it is a blue button
[1123.99s -> 1129.43s]  Are you sure there's nothing on the back there? Okay, there's nothing on the back, but there is a there's a serial number here
[1130.07s -> 1134.07s]  Okay, let's not worry about that. Let's let's let's get to the point here. Okay. What color is the button?
[1134.23s -> 1136.71s]  The button is blue and it says press
[1137.27s -> 1139.51s]  That's a blue button that says press
[1141.03s -> 1143.35s]  How many batteries do we have? We have any batteries?
[1144.07s -> 1146.55s]  There are no there are one battery
[1147.69s -> 1149.69s]  There's one battery. There's one battery
[1150.09s -> 1151.93s]  There are three batteries
[1151.93s -> 1153.61s]  The three. Okay
[1153.61s -> 1155.61s]  And the bottom said set abort
[1155.86s -> 1157.86s]  Uh, the button says press
[1157.86s -> 1159.78s]  Okay, uh
[1159.78s -> 1164.50s]  Three batteries the button says press and it is blue. Does it say frk somewhere on the bomb?
[1165.14s -> 1167.86s]  Uh, does it say it says there's frq on the bottom
[1169.13s -> 1171.93s]  There is no it says frk. No, there's no frk
[1174.31s -> 1177.77s]  Just just hold down the button. Just hold on the button for me. Hold the button down. Okay
[1178.41s -> 1183.75s]  What button what color it's just blue and there's a thing on the right that's blinking just blue blink
[1183.91s -> 1189.61s]  Okay, release it when it says four four in any position we did
[1191.42s -> 1193.93s]  There was a four at the beginning
[1193.93s -> 1199.00s]  All right, good. I can't believe I didn't do the half-life thing. I can't believe it. I sat there for so long
[1199.08s -> 1203.93s]  I cannot fucking believe it. See it's it's it's we learn we learn through
[1204.65s -> 1209.53s]  Uh, we're learning we're learning about things, you know, i'm learning about
[1210.15s -> 1213.77s]  Bostonians and you're learning about half-life. I can't believe it. That's worse than omega
[1214.31s -> 1217.03s]  I just don't I just get locked out. I get locked out of my own brain. All right
[1218.06s -> 1224.02s]  All right, we're doing we're doing it. We'll keep we'll go we'll go from here. We're gonna do w money
[1224.02s -> 1228.42s]  All right this left. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay, that sounds good half-life symbol. What an embarrassment
[1228.42s -> 1232.10s]  All right, double your money. You're ready to go. Just keep it rolling. I'm ready to go man. I'm ready to go
[1232.50s -> 1236.94s]  All right, i'm gonna be ready this time. No, i'm not gonna i'm gonna do this lightning in
[1238.06s -> 1239.59s]  all right
[1239.59s -> 1241.00s]  You can do this, man
[1241.00s -> 1243.88s]  You have to we have to trust each other and we i'm i'm not gonna do any
[1244.73s -> 1249.98s]  Bullshit because that leaves explosions. We have to do this. Here we go three wires
[1251.46s -> 1257.38s]  There is three wires. All right, one yellow one blue one red yellow blue red. That's it
[1258.39s -> 1263.26s]  So the the we do have a red buyer. Uh, there's one red is the last wire white
[1263.66s -> 1270.58s]  The last wire is red cut the last wire good symbols
[1271.94s -> 1277.72s]  Omega symbol looking at omega symbol ae. Yes. Okay
[1278.04s -> 1285.74s]  Uh, somebody had stitches everybody had stitches and they have a cut. It's like a frankenstein stitches and then a um
[1286.38s -> 1292.30s]  Like a h but the line is going from top right to bottom left. It's like it's like an h
[1293.26s -> 1303.99s]  Gotcha. Gotcha. Uh, we will be looking at uh stitches ae weird as h omega
[1304.49s -> 1311.51s]  Okay, now we have we have two buttons. There are two blue buttons. They both are the same exact button
[1311.67s -> 1316.95s]  It's a blue button that says press both of them are the same two blue buttons that say press
[1317.59s -> 1319.11s]  Gotcha. Gotcha
[1319.11s -> 1321.03s]  There's going to be some things that factor into this though
[1321.03s -> 1324.71s]  So we've got to be careful, but i'm gonna look through the manual here and see what we can deduct from this
[1325.29s -> 1326.97s]  um
[1326.97s -> 1329.21s]  How many batteries do we have on this bomb? There are
[1330.57s -> 1336.26s]  One there is one battery on this bomb only one only one bomb
[1336.26s -> 1337.53s]  Okay
[1337.53s -> 1345.53s]  Um, and the it said press on it. Yeah, both buttons say press. They're both blue. Okay
[1346.17s -> 1354.74s]  Okay, here we go. We're gonna be holding this down. Okay, hold the button down. Mm-hmm. Okay. I have a red
[1355.22s -> 1362.58s]  Blink it's blinking red. It's one in any position one in any position one in any position. Okay, you got it
[1362.74s -> 1369.59s]  Yes, I have to wait because I have to wait until it gets to a one. Okay. What about the second button?
[1370.31s -> 1375.27s]  If this yeah, it doesn't completely duplicate do the same procedure. Okay red again
[1375.67s -> 1385.94s]  Is this one in any position one in any position? Okay. All right, wait 10 seconds. I hope I hope I did this right
[1386.02s -> 1388.68s]  What's your favorite piece?
[1388.68s -> 1391.16s]  All right now
[1391.16s -> 1394.12s]  We have there. Okay. We got we got more symbols
[1395.24s -> 1400.84s]  Okay, okay. That's fine. That's fine. We can do symbols. Okay, we've got uh backwards p smiley face of the tongue sticking out
[1401.32s -> 1408.70s]  Uh upside the t the t up tb thing and then a trident. Okay
[1408.86s -> 1415.75s]  Uh tv thing tv thing smiley face trident tb and backwards tb, okay in that order
[1416.97s -> 1419.53s]  No, no, no, no, no. No. Okay. Uh, the order will be
[1420.26s -> 1423.94s]  Uh trident. Yep. Mr. Smiley. Yep
[1425.69s -> 1431.77s]  Uh weird tb weird tb got it. Yes, and then yes the last one. Okay, cool final module. We have plenty of time
[1431.77s -> 1434.49s]  So don't worry. Just relax. Okay. Okay. It's another wire module
[1435.67s -> 1439.51s]  We have one two, three four. There are five wires
[1440.57s -> 1442.57s]  Two of those wires are yellow
[1442.73s -> 1446.81s]  Two of those wires are red. One of them is white two yellow
[1447.37s -> 1450.17s]  Two red one white there are five of them
[1452.58s -> 1458.84s]  Um, is there any black wires here? There are no black wires and we have a total of five here
[1458.92s -> 1463.80s]  There are five wires two yellow two red one white cut the first wire
[1464.84s -> 1473.62s]  That was incorrect. Um, we're even them real quick again. I got really stressed. I'm sorry. All right, two yellow two red
[1474.10s -> 1480.86s]  One white there are five two yellow wires there are two red wires one white wire
[1481.02s -> 1484.38s]  That's it cut the second wire my bad my bad. We got it. Look at that
[1485.94s -> 1488.42s]  I I started freaking out like here come here comes the
[1489.42s -> 1493.90s]  The the the bomb demons in my head like come on dude. Just tell them anyway. I'm like no we have to commit to this
[1495.69s -> 1499.46s]  All right. I I think we're doing all right. We're doing all right. We're doing all right
[1499.94s -> 1507.10s]  But that's because I disciplined myself before the stream and I said, okay, maybe maybe I shouldn't be devolving the streaming too. It's like, uh,
[1508.26s -> 1511.54s]  Making fun of uh, jerma's lack of Greek symbols for like three hours. So
[1513.99s -> 1517.75s]  Well, we didn't know what we were doing last time. All right last you gotta give us some credit
[1518.47s -> 1521.75s]  The last time we played this that was the first time we've ever even seen the manual
[1522.31s -> 1525.19s]  And the first we didn't know how the game even worked. We had two
[1526.47s -> 1536.62s]  Be honest, we probably put both the stream for 10 fucking years now. Do we know what we're doing still? No next level
[1537.48s -> 1541.16s]  All right, this one how did it take us this long to do this last time?
[1542.95s -> 1547.27s]  Here we go. I think it was because I was screaming and uh, we had some issues
[1547.35s -> 1551.35s]  But anyway, um, let's go man. This one we gotta be careful. This one is three minutes
[1552.65s -> 1556.23s]  All right, but that that as long as we coordinated and we're not
[1557.09s -> 1564.55s]  Screaming. All right, relax. Just relax. We're just having a good time here. Relax. Relax. It's just a bomb
[1565.78s -> 1575.14s]  And you know 3 000 people screaming at you. It's okay. It's fine. Are you ready? I'm ready
[1575.94s -> 1577.00s]  We have
[1577.00s -> 1583.51s]  Uh, I believe this is simon says with colors. Okay, that's fine. That's fun. We have red it blinked red
[1584.86s -> 1588.62s]  Okay, read me the whatever. Let's let's do simon says first. All right, i've never
[1589.58s -> 1594.38s]  Okay, so, um, what are we looking at here? We're looking at it's uh, it's red
[1595.02s -> 1600.60s]  Red is the first one it blinked red before we do this. We need to check if there's a vowel on the bomb
[1601.00s -> 1607.32s]  Okay vowel on the bomb you got it. Uh, there is not wait vowel on the serial number or just on the bomb in general
[1607.88s -> 1609.88s]  Uh the the serial yes
[1609.88s -> 1620.81s]  Okay, there is not a vowel on this bomb. Let's go back to simon says, okay. Okay red, uh
[1621.37s -> 1628.26s]  You're gonna go blue red
[1628.26s -> 1641.94s]  Green blue green red green green blue green green
[1648.97s -> 1662.30s]  Red green green red blue green green red. Sorry. Sorry blue green green blue. Sorry. Jesus. Okay
[1665.78s -> 1672.34s]  Red green green red blue blue green green
[1672.98s -> 1680.22s]  Blue yellow, was it red green green red blue red green green red blue
[1683.29s -> 1689.59s]  So red green green red blue then you'd be looking at no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I was I was like reading that
[1689.59s -> 1697.19s]  Okay, let's stop freaking out. Okay. Hang on. You'll be looking at blue green green blue yellow that solution. What's happening?
[1698.65s -> 1700.49s]  blue
[1700.49s -> 1706.39s]  Oh my god, germa. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I just realized something if we get a strike on the simon
[1707.03s -> 1709.59s]  That means the equation is totally different so
[1710.70s -> 1712.94s]  I'm sorry. This is the first time i'm fucking reading. Okay
[1714.54s -> 1717.78s]  We're going we're going we're going we're going
[1717.78s -> 1723.14s]  Okay, look learning process learning process. My bad. That was totally on me. It gets tricky. It gets hard. Okay
[1723.14s -> 1727.30s]  Here we go. Ready? Okay. This time it's it's a little different this time. We have okay
[1727.86s -> 1732.58s]  A okay, it's the number four. It's the screen with it's a screen of the number and then four numbers underneath
[1734.12s -> 1736.36s]  Okay, so uh
[1736.44s -> 1741.64s]  Okay, it's the it's basically memory essentially, yeah, yes, it's a memory game and then you have to do this five times
[1741.64s -> 1743.32s]  I remember this one
[1743.32s -> 1747.32s]  All right. So when I did this I had a lot of problem. Yeah, it's your turn now. Ready?
[1747.48s -> 1753.94s]  All right inside the screen is the number four press the button in the fourth position
[1754.34s -> 1762.89s]  The number is now one press the button labeled for labeled for
[1766.31s -> 1775.61s]  One again press the button with the same label is just pressed in stage two the same label in stage two
[1776.60s -> 1780.20s]  Mm-hmm that was same label instead same label. Okay, that was four
[1782.74s -> 1789.18s]  Now the number is three press the button in the same position as it pressed in stage two
[1790.38s -> 1791.82s]  four, okay
[1791.82s -> 1795.96s]  finally four
[1795.96s -> 1800.87s]  Press the button with the same label as it pressed in stage three. It was also four
[1801.59s -> 1806.79s]  Done. Good. Okay. Awesome. Now we've got we have got a it's the word
[1806.87s -> 1811.85s]  It's there's a word in the box and then the six other words. So the word is red
[1813.96s -> 1817.64s]  Okay, hang on this car contraption is something like out of a sketch comedy routine
[1817.72s -> 1821.08s]  I'll tell them about it, which might be funny if you weren't connected to a bomb
[1821.48s -> 1822.52s]  I'll keep this brief
[1822.52s -> 1822.76s]  Okay
[1822.76s -> 1828.04s]  So read the display in a step one to determine which button label to read using the button label you step you step two
[1828.04s -> 1831.88s]  Determine which button to push repeat until the model has been disarmed. Okay, so what?
[1832.60s -> 1834.76s]  Word do we have in the thing? The word is
[1835.40s -> 1836.46s]  red
[1836.46s -> 1841.98s]  Inside of the box the word it's the word reading what is on in the middle button to the right middle to the right
[1841.98s -> 1851.10s]  The word is right. Okay, right. Let me see here. Uh, uh
[1853.82s -> 1859.02s]  Okay, i'm gonna spout i'm gonna spout these out and you just until you see some okay. So here we go. Yes
[1859.58s -> 1861.58s]  Nothing ready press
[1862.46s -> 1871.37s]  I see ready ready is on here. It's the bottom right slot first one ready. Okay, Joel
[1871.69s -> 1878.14s]  I don't want to alarm you but all right, uh, the word is no. Okay. What does it say?
[1878.78s -> 1883.90s]  Uh, you are next uh, uh sure done hold no, no, no, no, give me the word. Give me the word
[1884.46s -> 1887.32s]  Word is no the word is no
[1887.32s -> 1889.80s]  Okay, uh
[1889.80s -> 1891.80s]  Blank, uh three letters, uh
[1892.36s -> 1903.46s]  Wait, uh, uh, what this word y'all get down fuck that
[1909.32s -> 1913.80s]  Okay. Well, uh now we deducted how we should do simon sess and we do that quickly
[1914.28s -> 1921.00s]  We're quickly learning now that uh, you know with this reading thing. Don't worry. Don't worry. These are growing steps
[1921.08s -> 1925.24s]  We did great at the first tier. Let's just let's just keep going and hammer this in and eventually we'll be
[1925.72s -> 1930.76s]  Experts, but i'm just telling you something it's gonna be next bomb. We're gonna actually be treating as we'll die. Yes
[1931.40s -> 1937.08s]  Next one is so serious. Yeah, we will actually be dying. Okay, i'm gonna take this as if we were gonna die
[1938.04s -> 1940.04s]  We are going to die in there. Okay
[1940.52s -> 1941.91s]  All right
[1941.91s -> 1943.91s]  Like your life we are going to die
[1944.63s -> 1947.19s]  Okay
[1947.19s -> 1948.98s]  Okay, let's go
[1948.98s -> 1954.26s]  Here we go for treat this like it was real

[2150.73s -> 2152.73s]  Honestly, don't don't worry about it because now
[2153.83s -> 2155.83s]  That simon says thing was fine
[2156.39s -> 2158.39s]  we're quickly learning that the uh
[2159.13s -> 2162.25s]  The it's called who's on first that one is a little difficult for us
[2162.33s -> 2166.25s]  It is because we have to be very specific because i'm noticing a lot like here's the thing
[2166.25s -> 2173.53s]  That's very important about this some of these you are there's three variations on you are there's you are without you space are
[2174.89s -> 2176.89s]  You know, whatever, uh
[2177.78s -> 2179.22s]  There's possessive
[2179.22s -> 2185.30s]  Like your pizza. Yeah, why oh you are right? Why oh you are and then there's there then there is
[2186.10s -> 2189.30s]  You are a pizza as in you apostrophe re, you know
[2190.10s -> 2191.54s]  Oh shit
[2191.54s -> 2192.66s]  Okay
[2192.66s -> 2200.58s]  All right. So i'm gonna start saying apostrophe i'm gonna say possessive apostrophe or space on the you and there's also this different variations on
[2201.86s -> 2207.86s]  Right. There's not just uh, there's uh, yeah and okay h h h so there's gonna be a lot of
[2208.82s -> 2212.82s]  Specifics here and we have to be super fucking like talking about this
[2213.22s -> 2218.26s]  So, uh, this is this is very bad for me because not i'm not an english speaker. You know, I don't speak english
[2218.26s -> 2219.06s]  Yeah
[2219.06s -> 2221.06s]  Neither do I so uh
[2222.38s -> 2223.34s]  well
[2223.34s -> 2226.22s]  We're just gonna have to do the best. All right, but here's the thing. Here's the thing
[2227.43s -> 2228.65s]  coordination
[2228.65s -> 2233.37s]  Let's not screw it any every second special for us is vital. So now
[2234.33s -> 2237.14s]  The problem was and all right
[2237.22s -> 2240.66s]  I burnt like 20 seconds during the simon says because I tried to do it too fast
[2241.14s -> 2242.26s]  You can't do okay
[2242.26s -> 2247.54s]  For instance, it was like it was like green red red and you were like, oh blue like yellow yellow
[2247.62s -> 2252.26s]  And I did blue yellow yellow, but it doesn't register. You have to go slow. Okay. Okay. No, I get it

[2675.99s -> 2686.87s]  We did it. That was good. My soul escaped my butthole. I was my heart was fucking beating on my chest
[2690.09s -> 2695.21s]  So what what happened to chimo man? Oh nice bomb defusing 101. We we passed the tutorial
[2699.83s -> 2705.99s]  All right, well that proves that we can do this. I think honestly this sounds ironic, but I think me being an idiot
[2706.07s -> 2708.07s]  I'm actually reading better than actually playing
[2708.87s -> 2710.87s]  I think we found our groove
[2711.34s -> 2714.54s]  Yeah, I think so which will shake up later on the string mind you so
[2715.26s -> 2717.66s]  That's gonna be fun
[2717.66s -> 2719.53s]  Okay
[2719.53s -> 2721.53s]  This one. Okay. Now they're getting harder
[2722.25s -> 2724.73s]  Okay, this one is called a hidden message
[2725.45s -> 2727.75s]  Oh, yeah, this is now moderate difficulty
[2728.63s -> 2730.63s]  Okay, we do have five minutes
[2731.67s -> 2739.02s]  Information can be obscured in ways that are time consuming to decode in the world of bomb defusing. That's a bad thing
[2739.75s -> 2742.47s]  Information can possibly mean it's weird with five minutes
[2743.59s -> 2751.90s]  Okay, but that's fine. Listen, the last one was so hard because we were at like two minutes. I think yeah, that was three minutes
[2751.90s -> 2756.28s]  Yeah, that's a little all right. Okay. Well, that's fine. Let's just try it out
[2756.28s -> 2767.78s]  Let's try it out and see what we got. Let's give it up. Let's give it a whirl. Let's go. I'm so fucking nervous
[2768.34s -> 2769.54s]  I know
[2769.54s -> 2771.54s]  I think there's only three modules though
[2771.54s -> 2773.06s]  All right, you ready?
[2773.06s -> 2775.99s]  Yep, do a hard blink. Here we go
[2776.79s -> 2782.39s]  Uh, we have a new module here. It is a game boy looking thing that has five letters on it
[2783.29s -> 2788.09s]  It's a five letters. Okay, five letters looks like a game boy and there's arrows on the top and bottom
[2788.09s -> 2793.77s]  I can switch I can change the letters. It's five. Okay. Well, here's what i'm gonna i'm gonna start writing down
[2794.17s -> 2796.17s]  I think I yeah, I see this module
[2796.73s -> 2799.77s]  This is gonna be impossible because i'm gonna have to deduct a word from this. All right
[2800.09s -> 2802.17s]  So just give me the first letters. Okay
[2802.81s -> 2804.95s]  The letter is a
[2804.95s -> 2806.94s]  Okay, a
[2806.94s -> 2808.74s]  oh
[2808.74s -> 2810.26s]  Okay. No, no, no, no
[2810.26s -> 2812.57s]  so so so
[2812.65s -> 2819.21s]  I'm not saying what's on screen. I'm saying cycle through them. Oh, okay. The first letter has potential to be a
[2820.31s -> 2821.75s]  okay
[2821.75s -> 2825.75s]  Oh, yeah h or v or j x o
[2826.66s -> 2830.74s]  A x o h v j
[2832.07s -> 2832.87s]  Okay
[2832.87s -> 2835.14s]  second ones
[2835.14s -> 2837.14s]  o i b m
[2837.70s -> 2845.93s]  R q so we're looking o i m q almost the two letter ones. Oh, oh
[2846.49s -> 2849.26s]  Oh
[2849.26s -> 2851.82s]  Oh then oh then oh then what?
[2852.78s -> 2854.78s]  What do you want the third one?
[2855.42s -> 2859.58s]  Cycle through the the the second one. Okay, the second one has o i
[2860.22s -> 2861.10s]  b
[2861.10s -> 2861.90s]  m
[2861.90s -> 2867.30s]  r and q okay. Here we go. Um, read me the third ones k

[2872.74s -> 2874.74s]  k n y
[2875.46s -> 2877.46s]  o s m

[3082.50s -> 3084.50s]  Okay, three modules
[3084.90s -> 3089.54s]  And it says do these wires look different to you? Does this bomb look exploded to you?
[3091.24s -> 3093.24s]  Great. All right. Well, let's uh
[3094.04s -> 3096.04s]  Well, see bar you've got a good ham here
[3101.03s -> 3109.48s]  Okay, let's go i'm fucking nervous
[3111.29s -> 3120.36s]  We're gonna die german. Oh, I need a second. I just like farmed a bad joke for fun
[3120.84s -> 3122.84s]  All right. We got a simon says
[3124.04s -> 3126.92s]  Okay. First of all, do we have a vowel or do we not have a vowel?
[3128.76s -> 3130.76s]  there is
[3130.84s -> 3132.84s]  No vowel on this
[3133.48s -> 3135.48s]  There's no vowel. Okay
[3135.48s -> 3138.12s]  Uh, so what what is the color sim blue?
[3140.07s -> 3141.50s]  yellow
[3141.50s -> 3144.86s]  Okay, blue green
[3146.87s -> 3152.06s]  yellow green
[3152.06s -> 3154.06s]  blue green blue
[3155.48s -> 3157.16s]  yellow green yellow
[3157.16s -> 3163.32s]  blue green blue red
[3164.92s -> 3166.92s]  yellow green yellow blue
[3167.16s -> 3171.61s]  final one
[3171.61s -> 3174.81s]  blue green blue red red
[3176.07s -> 3178.63s]  You're gonna make fun of this. But uh, do they have a
[3179.27s -> 3183.03s]  What's my trade of thought? What what what happened? Hold on. Wait, what are you waiting for a vowel?
[3184.82s -> 3187.54s]  What did we have a vowel? Yes or no, sorry. No, no
[3188.10s -> 3194.26s]  Hold on. Okay. Okay. It's making sure. Okay, so read me them again. Sorry, but it's quick. Um, it was
[3194.82s -> 3198.02s]  blue green blue red red
[3199.66s -> 3203.10s]  Yellow green yellow blue and the last one was red. Yes
[3204.06s -> 3206.22s]  Yeah, hold on. Let's just refresh
[3207.02s -> 3208.63s]  Okay
[3208.63s -> 3209.83s]  Yes
[3209.83s -> 3213.19s]  blue green blue red red
[3214.73s -> 3216.97s]  yellow green yellow blue
[3218.06s -> 3221.26s]  No, no, no, sorry my bad. No, no, that's green. That's yellow
[3222.52s -> 3229.29s]  Did we do it? What it was red red? What what i have a suggestion
[3229.85s -> 3234.76s]  All right, we clock out of this one now and repeat it immediately. There's no need for this time waste
[3237.26s -> 3243.93s]  Let's just let's just redo this one. Let's just leave the room back out of the situation and redo this mission
[3244.41s -> 3247.05s]  All right, because I lost my track just walk away
[3247.61s -> 3250.07s]  Walk away walk away from this one
[3253.06s -> 3255.06s]  You don't have to kill us
[3255.70s -> 3259.22s]  Go out of the fucking room. You have to like blow me off. It was quicker to do that
[3259.54s -> 3264.39s]  I was quicker to do it that way. All right, let's
[3265.69s -> 3269.05s]  It's sorry that was totally on me. Do you see how easy it is to just throw
[3269.37s -> 3273.77s]  It's so easy to throw everything off because it was like, okay blue green blue blue
[3273.85s -> 3276.57s]  Do we have a serial number? Do we have to do a vowel? It's like, hey
[3277.45s -> 3281.61s]  It's super embarrassing but the problem the problem with that is like it's like riding a bike
[3281.69s -> 3286.17s]  Like, you know how to do it, but somebody just like throws a stick in the wheel and you're like, okay
[3286.33s -> 3292.22s]  Yeah, like all right. Let's just cut our shit. Yeah, was there no there was no vowel. I don't remember
[3294.58s -> 3296.58s]  Okay. Okay. Don't worry about this. We can do this. Here we go
[3297.70s -> 3300.02s]  All right. I'm going to talk very clearly and very slowly
[3300.90s -> 3304.98s]  Okay. All right. We're going to do this wires here. We have six wires
[3305.78s -> 3311.54s]  And they're in this order four blue two red blue blue blue red red
[3312.26s -> 3314.26s]  Last digit of the serial number is odd
[3314.74s -> 3319.42s]  Is the last digit of the serial number odd it is even? Okay
[3320.30s -> 3327.29s]  Uh, it's exactly one yellow wire. There is it's only blue and red four blue two red
[3329.48s -> 3332.20s]  If there are no red wires cut the last wire, but you do have red bars
[3332.20s -> 3332.44s]  Yeah
[3332.44s -> 3341.26s]  Two red wires the last wire is red two red wires the fourth wire cut the fourth wire wire done. Okay. Okay, we have
[3341.90s -> 3348.54s]  Um some different looking wires. These are strange looking wires. They go they go they're they're they're different. They're vertical not horizontal
[3348.62s -> 3350.62s]  Are they are are they? Uh
[3351.74s -> 3354.14s]  Do they have a star and a light on them? Um
[3355.10s -> 3357.34s]  Yes, they they did they did for a second
[3357.34s -> 3361.42s]  But we're gonna go to go with simon says because the lights just turned off simon says, okay
[3361.98s -> 3363.98s]  Simon says holy shit. Okay. Yes
[3364.46s -> 3366.46s]  Uh, yeah, I know
[3366.70s -> 3367.58s]  Okay
[3367.58s -> 3369.58s]  No, I just I I still on that page
[3369.90s -> 3376.78s]  So so read me this serial, um serial number. No, no, no serious. No, no, no. There's a vowel. Okay. So, uh,
[3377.18s -> 3382.30s]  Here we go. Okay. Let's go first flash blue red
[3385.98s -> 3388.82s]  blue yellow
[3388.82s -> 3390.34s]  red green
[3391.14s -> 3393.61s]  good
[3393.61s -> 3395.61s]  blue yellow blue
[3397.06s -> 3402.10s]  Red green red
[3402.10s -> 3408.55s]  Uh, hold on shut up. Not you. All right back to the wires. That was it. We're done
[3409.27s -> 3411.27s]  We have uh, five wires
[3411.83s -> 3415.30s]  Well, that was almost this we're done with it. Yeah, that's it. That's it. It's green light
[3416.10s -> 3421.30s]  Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. So relax. We have three full minutes to figure this out. So just okay. Okay, here we go
[3421.78s -> 3425.14s]  we're gonna be looking at something called uh, uh, it's saying the
[3426.10s -> 3430.33s]  These wires are not like the others some have stripes this makes them completely different
[3430.33s -> 3432.89s]  The good news is that we found a concise set of instructions
[3433.45s -> 3435.45s]  so this is what it's referred as a
[3436.55s -> 3441.21s]  M diagram, okay. Oh, I just gotta align this. Okay. So what is the first one?
[3442.17s -> 3445.45s]  Okay, so from left to right it is white. Yes
[3446.63s -> 3448.63s]  Okay. Um, no, no, no, no, okay
[3449.11s -> 3453.43s]  That doesn't matter the instructions said that doesn't matter. Okay. It's like I line these so we have does it have a star?
[3454.07s -> 3456.15s]  Yeah, okay. There are three stars on the bottom
[3457.35s -> 3465.19s]  Okay, the first second and third wire are on a star. Okay. Uh, okay that won't matter then. Okay, so
[3466.84s -> 3468.84s]  You would need to uh
[3469.24s -> 3474.04s]  Let me let me read you the wires. Let me cut the first one cut the first wire first
[3474.04s -> 3481.54s]  Like all like like left the leftmost wire. Yes. Okay. Uh, there's more to do. Yes
[3482.26s -> 3486.98s]  So, uh, what's the what's the what's the second one? So these wires are red
[3487.70s -> 3490.90s]  And then blue and red striped that's the two different that's it
[3490.90s -> 3494.50s]  So there's two blue and red striped and then there's two red
[3494.74s -> 3499.22s]  Does it have a light? Does it have a light the blue and red stripe has a light and it's on a star?
[3500.87s -> 3504.39s]  Okay, that's a star. Uh, don't cut that one. Next one
[3504.63s -> 3511.64s]  The next one is a red wire on a star with no light red wire with a star. No light
[3520.31s -> 3526.65s]  Cut that one. Yes, there's more to do. Okay. Yeah, keep going. Keep going
[3526.73s -> 3531.53s]  The next wire is no star with a light and it is a red and blue striped wire
[3532.54s -> 3536.38s]  So just the light on this no, no, no, no star light. Just the light no star
[3537.70s -> 3549.77s]  It's the last serial number even is the serial number even? Uh, yeah, the number is is even cut it cut that wire
[3550.57s -> 3558.04s]  Okay, there are two wires that remain the last wire is they have a star the last wire does not have a star
[3559.29s -> 3566.39s]  Okay, so that's nothing on it. Not just red. Let's have a star. Nothing. Nothing. Just red. It's the last even it
[3566.39s -> 3569.53s]  It was even right? It was even it was even last year lumber cut it
[3571.82s -> 3579.75s]  Somebody said hello cut it. Hello. Just cut it. Hello. What do you mean? I don't want to fuck it up
[3581.45s -> 3589.62s]  Okay, so do you know what a venn diagram is? I'm gonna pretend to yes. Uh, okay, so it's like a giant
[3590.46s -> 3591.98s]  um
[3591.98s -> 3598.78s]  It's like a bunch of circles circles with different colors essentially inside of each circle. Yes. Yes. I know that spells the solution. Yes
[3599.50s -> 3601.02s]  Except these are colorless in the manual
[3601.02s -> 3607.18s]  So you're gonna have to really like squint your fucking eyes. The only way of reading this is if the colors spell out
[3608.22s -> 3614.46s]  Uh, if they're striped or dotted it's bullshit, but don't worry about it. I feel like you're doing a lot of good work here
[3616.47s -> 3621.35s]  NA education, um, well here's the thing about my NA education. Uh, Joel, I gotta ask you this
[3621.99s -> 3626.07s]  Uh people people like oh, I can't believe you didn't know you didn't know what what that symbol was
[3626.07s -> 3628.07s]  You didn't know what that math problem was
[3628.07s -> 3630.07s]  When was the last time you sat in a math class?
[3630.87s -> 3636.04s]  Like what's the time you were sitting in a math class in a chair in a math class
[3637.00s -> 3639.56s]  I feel like i'm in a math class every fucking stream with these people
[3643.75s -> 3649.75s]  Uh 100 years. I don't know. Uh, it's been a while. So it's been 20 years since i've been in a math class
[3650.82s -> 3653.38s]  So yeah, I don't know what the omega symbol is. You're 60
[3657.21s -> 3660.55s]  No, i'm I turned I turned 25 next week
[3661.43s -> 3667.78s]  This one's gonna be hard
[3667.78s -> 3669.78s]  Okay, uh, this one is four modules
[3670.74s -> 3674.18s]  And it says 60 percent of the time this bomb explodes every time
[3675.22s -> 3677.22s]  Okay, I don't know what that's supposed to mean
[3677.22s -> 3680.98s]  Does this mean that we have a 60 percent chance to lose? It means nothing good. It means nothing good
[3683.54s -> 3689.22s]  All right, let's just are you good. I'm ready to rock and roll man. All right. I'm ready. I'm feeling 100 about this
[3690.42s -> 3694.42s]  Did you take a hundred percent? I'm sure that is I took a multivitamin last time it helped
[3695.56s -> 3696.60s]  It helped
[3696.60s -> 3701.88s]  Yeah, yeah, but I don't need performance enhancing drugs to do this all I need is the the skill of a gamer. All right
[3702.52s -> 3706.94s]  Yeah, if uh, all those guys that got in trouble when they did took vitamin b12
[3708.63s -> 3710.63s]  All those athletes
[3710.63s -> 3712.95s]  Yeah
[3712.95s -> 3719.19s]  It's about honor. It's about honor. Yeah, I i'm low on vitamin d. I'm not gonna i'm not gonna like drink any milk
[3719.99s -> 3721.88s]  All right, you good
[3721.88s -> 3722.92s]  I'm good
[3722.92s -> 3727.61s]  Here we go. We have a different module this module
[3727.77s -> 3732.81s]  Uh has a megahertz on it and it's a blinking light with with almost like a radio, uh dial
[3733.29s -> 3736.41s]  I can change the the amount of megahertz and there's a button that says tx
[3738.23s -> 3743.03s]  We have a blinking light up top and then we have something with megahertz. It's it's drama 3.5
[3743.75s -> 3745.93s]  Is this morse code?
[3745.93s -> 3747.93s]  I mean morse code. I don't hear anything
[3749.18s -> 3754.22s]  Is there a light going beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep if it was morse code?
[3754.86s -> 3756.86s]  It's wouldn't be able to hear it
[3757.45s -> 3763.69s]  No, it's a visual because that's how people communicate with flashlights in like world wars. Okay. All right. Yes, there is a light up here
[3764.09s -> 3770.73s]  And I uh, okay. Uh, yeah, do you know how to read morse code jerma? No, absolutely not zero knowledge. I know that like I know
[3773.64s -> 3784.03s]  What's that that's that's sos right that's sos
[3784.97s -> 3787.21s]  jerma
[3787.21s -> 3789.21s]  You can't read morse code
[3791.59s -> 3793.59s]  Why the fuck do I know why would I know morse code?
[3796.33s -> 3800.65s]  That's basic school knowledge. No, it's not what is this 1910?
[3800.89s -> 3805.05s]  What do you mean basic school knowledge? This is like 1840. All right, ready
[3805.93s -> 3809.29s]  Jerma, I can't read morse code either. I'm fucked too. Oh god. Okay. So here we go
[3810.25s -> 3812.73s]  this
[3812.73s -> 3816.09s]  All right. Listen, listen, we wasted a lot of time on this. Can you hear my screen?
[3819.38s -> 3822.26s]  I can okay, you ready listen to my stream for just i'm gonna be quiet
[3829.90s -> 3853.34s]  No, hold on let me hold on. Okay, jerma. I have a better solution to this
[3854.06s -> 3857.38s]  Is that helping a better solution to this? No, absolutely not
[3858.02s -> 3861.86s]  This is going to practice right? It doesn't matter if this explodes or not this we have to hammer this in
[3862.26s -> 3864.26s]  Uh, we I have to teach you morse code
[3864.82s -> 3866.50s]  or rather
[3866.50s -> 3870.42s]  I gotta complain about something. It's dots and dashes. I know I know the basics is dots and dashes
[3871.86s -> 3873.86s]  I just gotta complain with something chat
[3874.18s -> 3878.26s]  Yeah, yeah, let me let me just explain something to both chats here. So
[3879.54s -> 3881.46s]  Two weeks ago
[3881.46s -> 3883.46s]  I read the manual and it said
[3883.70s -> 3885.38s]  morse code
[3885.38s -> 3887.46s]  And i've been telling chat for two weeks that
[3888.34s -> 3893.94s]  Chat i'm going to learn morse code off stream so they can snitch on me and tell jerma beforehand
[3894.10s -> 3896.98s]  Joel has been practicing off stream in reality
[3897.30s -> 3902.02s]  I did not practice at all because I wanted you guys to just see how much of a snitch you guys were to jerma
[3903.05s -> 3908.73s]  Um, so I didn't practice at all. So you guys that have been going around talking to jerma saying hey, by the way
[3908.81s -> 3910.33s]  Joel's been cheating
[3910.41s -> 3912.57s]  You guys fucked up, I know who you guys are
[3912.97s -> 3919.53s]  I'm gonna tell you on sos and fucking morse codes because i'm coming over there and i'm gonna tell you something snitches get stitches
[3919.61s -> 3925.37s]  All right, so fuck you. All right. Anyway, but that doesn't deduct from the problem here. We have to learn this
[3925.61s -> 3931.77s]  So I propose this morse code is relatively simple. It's a it's a matter of taking it slow and easy
[3931.93s -> 3934.41s]  So what I propose here, you're going to be reading me again
[3934.57s -> 3939.29s]  I know that there's a clock here, but don't worry about it exploding. We have to learn this so again
[3940.47s -> 3942.47s]  I have a diagram
[3943.03s -> 3946.79s]  Okay, so here's what i'm saying. This is going to be a repeating pattern essentially, right? Yes
[3948.04s -> 3950.60s]  And we're not going to be we don't need to read the full letter
[3950.84s -> 3957.94s]  So for example, uh, if the word will be shell there will be a frequency at 3505 do that
[3958.18s -> 3962.25s]  That's a test just ask anyway press tx
[3963.94s -> 3967.38s]  Okay, I just want to make a make a see if it worked anyway, but that doesn't matter
[3967.78s -> 3971.86s]  Uh, so here's what we're gonna do again. I know that the clock is ticking, but this is just a practice round
[3972.34s -> 3977.72s]  Um, so, um, let me read this. Here we go. Okay
[3978.44s -> 3985.24s]  interpret the signal from the flashing light using the morse code chart to spell one of the words in the table the signal will loop with a
[3985.24s -> 3992.12s]  Long gap between repetitions once the word is identified set the corresponding frequency and press the transmit tx button
[3992.76s -> 3994.15s]  so
[3994.15s -> 3997.51s]  Essentially what we're going to be looking at here is um
[3998.31s -> 4003.27s]  It's it's going to be actually quite simple. Um, it's it's it's a you are going to be rating me
[4003.59s -> 4009.45s]  Yeah, yeah, you're gonna be reading you're gonna say dot dash, right? Yeah to spell out something
[4009.45s -> 4012.97s]  Yes, and there's going to be a space in between these when the spaces happen
[4013.05s -> 4017.62s]  I propose that you say dot dash comma dot dot dash comma
[4017.86s -> 4018.26s]  Yes
[4018.26s -> 4024.42s]  And that's going to spell out a word for me to like deduct and then we take that word and then we transpose that into a frequency
[4025.22s -> 4028.04s]  so, uh
[4028.04s -> 4034.18s]  German did that and any of that register? I was repeating the last three words you were saying and nodding my head. Uh,
[4034.82s -> 4038.06s]  No, no, I get it. I get it. Yeah, it's dot dot dash
[4039.53s -> 4041.77s]  dots and dashes and then in between
[4042.57s -> 4046.81s]  Like for instance like dot dot dash if it was dot dot dash
[4047.29s -> 4051.85s]  That's a letter so dot dot dash that will actually let me see if that actually means something
[4052.25s -> 4057.14s]  Dot dot dash would be you as in the letter you yes, and after you say that
[4057.62s -> 4062.34s]  Make sure you say comma so you don't say dot dot dash dash dot dot like that would fuck me up
[4062.58s -> 4068.02s]  Yeah, add a little comment between this. I know where to separate the letters. I think we're good to go
[4068.18s -> 4068.98s]  I think I get it
[4068.98s -> 4071.78s]  Okay, uh, but keep in mind if there's misspellings here
[4071.78s -> 4074.82s]  We're gonna have to do this all over again and this could lead to a lot of fucking problems
[4074.82s -> 4078.66s]  But i'm gonna be very look. I promise i'm known for my noises, right?
[4078.82s -> 4084.17s]  Like I mean that's good. I'm known to be able to get correct noises. If there's one thing i'm confident
[4084.17s -> 4087.27s]  It's making noise. Okay, i'm ready
[4089.38s -> 4092.82s]  I'm known for like literally if you type in german on h5 into google
[4092.98s -> 4096.58s]  The first thing that pops up is probably like the mini century noise so like i'm good
[4097.30s -> 4103.03s]  Uh, we don't have to do that this one. All right, we got the um, we got the
[4103.75s -> 4106.49s]  We have a new module. It is three wires
[4107.54s -> 4114.10s]  On horizontal and there's one two, three abc. It's a new module. Oh, we're looking at a wire sequence here
[4114.10s -> 4116.02s]  We're looking at a wire. Yeah, it's a wire sequence
[4116.02s -> 4121.06s]  The wires are horizontal and they and there are there's one two three abc on the left and right
[4121.14s -> 4125.94s]  Let me let me read this see what the fuck this is within this model. There are several panels with okay
[4125.94s -> 4131.38s]  So basically this can also be a practice round because this is also going to be something completely fucking
[4132.98s -> 4135.78s]  Within this module there are several panels with wires with them
[4135.94s -> 4141.06s]  But only one panel is visible at a time switch to the next panel by using the down button and the previous panel
[4141.06s -> 4143.69s]  By using the up button. Okay
[4143.69s -> 4146.81s]  Jerma, okay, press the down button to go to a new panel and it said
[4148.60s -> 4150.60s]  Don't don't don't touch no touch
[4151.69s -> 4156.01s]  Do not switch to the next panel until you're sure that you have cut all the necessary wires on the current panel
[4156.41s -> 4164.25s]  Jerma, anyway cut the wires as directed by the following table wire occurrences are cumulatively all over the panels within the module and
[4165.03s -> 4168.98s]  Okay. So the first one here you have to tell me
[4170.68s -> 4177.98s]  One goes to what and what color? Okay. So one for instance one is black and it goes one to a
[4180.12s -> 4188.98s]  One to a okay cut it. Okay. The next wire is blue and it goes two to b
[4192.46s -> 4197.98s]  Do not cut that one. Oh, actually does it go to b? Yes
[4199.51s -> 4201.27s]  Sorry cut that one
[4201.27s -> 4205.19s]  That was my mistake. I'm so sorry. I'm so glad that there's like a lot of audio in the background
[4205.19s -> 4207.35s]  Because that was like a bullfrog noise that I made
[4209.21s -> 4213.29s]  All right, so then three goes to c and that's the last one to cut anyways, so I cut it. Yes
[4213.53s -> 4219.50s]  Yes, and then go down. Okay. I see. All right. I get you. All right, so we got four five six
[4219.66s -> 4224.06s]  There is no wire on four. We have a black wire five b
[4227.03s -> 4229.03s]  Uh skip to the next one
[4229.03s -> 4234.41s]  Black wire six c. Yeah. Yeah, just skip the next one. I I think this will work. Okay
[4235.30s -> 4243.80s]  Uh, it's seven eight nine and then a b c eight. Okay, so uh, eight goes to c blue wire
[4244.82s -> 4252.39s]  Cut cut cut the blue one. Okay, nine now goes to c black wire and then we'll take it will be
[4253.35s -> 4254.79s]  in terms of like
[4254.79s -> 4258.79s]  Occurrences like how many blacks this will be only black wire will be
[4260.65s -> 4263.85s]  So this will be the second right? Oh, we have to keep track of how many wires there were
[4265.43s -> 4271.27s]  Okay, and then we'll be so the sec this will be the second one go up go up go up. Oh you can go up
[4271.35s -> 4275.08s]  Okay, so wait, then now is okay. So this there are two
[4275.64s -> 4281.19s]  Black wires here on this one and then on the one before that there's one black wire on the one before that
[4282.23s -> 4289.99s]  So we're looking at four four in total now. So this is the fourth black wire. Okay. Uh, does it go to c? Yes
[4291.03s -> 4295.45s]  Cut it. That's it. Next one is
[4296.01s -> 4301.40s]  Uh 10 11 12 a b c 10 is a blue wire 10 b
[4301.80s -> 4308.06s]  So the blue one will be in terms of occurrence. We've been looking at the this would be
[4308.70s -> 4314.07s]  One this would be this would be the third blue wire. Does it go to a?
[4314.73s -> 4316.89s]  Uh, it does not it goes to b
[4319.30s -> 4323.86s]  Uh, don't okay. So second one second one is a red wire 11 c
[4326.26s -> 4328.26s]  Okay, and that will be I think the second one
[4328.74s -> 4329.98s]  Yeah
[4329.98s -> 4332.71s]  um, I don't know
[4332.71s -> 4334.47s]  Yeah, probably
[4334.71s -> 4337.35s]  Just go next. Just go next. You can't say probably
[4338.07s -> 4340.86s]  Yeah, probably. I don't know. Oh my god
[4341.90s -> 4347.50s]  Listen, it's a completely new fucking log to me and I I don't I don't it's hard to like decipher
[4347.50s -> 4352.70s]  What the fuck these mean, but whatever whatever listen if we refresh now and we get a morse code one
[4353.26s -> 4357.18s]  I I think I think we're we're good. All right, we've learned we've learned these two
[4357.98s -> 4365.43s]  We've learned these two now maybe the bomb. Okay, let's just let's just get some ass in absolutes if you're a bomb diffuser
[4365.51s -> 4371.83s]  Okay, okay. No, you got it. You got it. You got it man. You got it. Here we go. Ready? Yes. Yes restart in go
[4373.61s -> 4378.38s]  Simon says okay, but are you sure it's just simon says though?
[4378.86s -> 4383.26s]  What do uh, no, I mean the Simon says that we have morse code on this one and one of the new wire ones
[4383.98s -> 4385.50s]  but there's
[4385.50s -> 4388.62s]  Simon says how about how about this another practice round it here?
[4388.70s -> 4389.98s]  Because here's what I want to do
[4389.98s -> 4392.94s]  I want to get this morse code shit down here so we can do this in the future, right?
[4392.94s -> 4393.82s]  You got it. All right
[4393.82s -> 4397.82s]  So, uh, you remember what I said about saying like comas and all that shit. Yep
[4398.06s -> 4402.38s]  I I got you. I got you. All right, so let me let me wait till let's wait till we get a big break here
[4402.62s -> 4411.94s]  Okay, hold on. Mm-hmm dot dot dot dot that's h
[4412.34s -> 4428.30s]  Okay, so we have dot dot dot germa. I already know the answer. It's three five. Oh five dot three five
[4428.30s -> 4433.42s]  Oh five three five. Oh five is a solution. No, it's not three five. Oh five three five
[4433.90s -> 4435.90s]  three point five oh three point five oh five
[4436.54s -> 4437.98s]  three five
[4437.98s -> 4440.14s]  One five three five one five
[4440.78s -> 4442.78s]  That's correct, sorry my bad
[4442.94s -> 4444.94s]  All right. Now we've got the wires
[4445.10s -> 4447.82s]  I'll tell you i'll tell the solution for this and this is going to be a strategy for us
[4447.82s -> 4451.02s]  All right, I know we probably can't do this. It's another practice round here do this quick
[4451.02s -> 4453.82s]  Okay, so basically I have all these words that correspond to the letter
[4454.30s -> 4457.50s]  And basically if the letter or there's words there's words
[4457.82s -> 4459.58s]  There's all of these words
[4459.58s -> 4462.38s]  But this one was unique because it was the only one that started with an h
[4462.62s -> 4467.82s]  That means I can deduct and immediately know the answer beforehand so I can immediately spit out the code at you. So
[4469.14s -> 4470.58s]  That's
[4470.58s -> 4474.10s]  All right. All right. We got we got the the wire when we practiced last time here it comes
[4474.66s -> 4477.22s]  All right. We have okay two red wires
[4477.70s -> 4479.70s]  one two three a b c
[4480.42s -> 4487.00s]  One b red. Okay, you're gonna have to repeat that because I got lost in the manual here. I'm so sorry
[4487.56s -> 4489.80s]  We have this now now now
[4491.08s -> 4493.08s]  Okay, so we have two red wires. That's correct
[4494.49s -> 4496.49s]  Okay, so uh the first one
[4497.26s -> 4499.26s]  uh does it go to
[4499.74s -> 4504.14s]  C now you said a right one goes from one to b red wire
[4505.08s -> 4509.96s]  Okay, do not cut that one. The second one goes to to a two to a red wire
[4511.00s -> 4516.41s]  Skip all of these just go to the next one. The next one we have four five six a b c
[4517.29s -> 4522.57s]  The first wire is a black wire four to b second wire is a blue wire
[4524.73s -> 4527.85s]  Okay, the next wire is a blue wire five to c
[4527.85s -> 4531.24s]  Skip to the next
[4533.24s -> 4536.76s]  This next one is seven eight nine a b c
[4538.12s -> 4542.44s]  The two wires that are present on this module are red and do we have
[4543.40s -> 4545.40s]  Okay, if there's a red wire
[4545.40s -> 4546.60s]  Cut it right now
[4546.60s -> 4547.64s]  Okay
[4547.64s -> 4550.20s]  The next one is a black wire nine a
[4551.88s -> 4556.76s]  Okay, and this would be the the third black wire. Yeah, that's okay. This would be the one
[4557.72s -> 4559.72s]  This would be the second black wire
[4560.12s -> 4562.84s]  Okay, and that goes to a a you said
[4563.80s -> 4565.40s]  uh cut it
[4565.40s -> 4570.76s]  Got it. Okay last one. We have three wires. It's 10 11 12 a b c
[4570.92s -> 4573.64s]  This is a black wires the first one it goes to b
[4574.68s -> 4576.68s]  Cut that cut the black wire
[4576.92s -> 4579.32s]  Okay. Now we have two red wires
[4579.94s -> 4582.42s]  11 b
[4582.42s -> 4585.78s]  okay, and in terms of occurrences this this one will be the
[4587.34s -> 4590.38s]  Third or fourth one. Yeah, this would be the one two
[4593.22s -> 4595.69s]  three
[4595.69s -> 4597.85s]  This would be the fourth red wire
[4598.49s -> 4600.25s]  that is dust dust
[4600.25s -> 4602.49s]  Does the fourth one here go to a?
[4603.05s -> 4604.41s]  It goes to b
[4604.41s -> 4609.64s]  Okay, do not cut that one and the last one was a red wire as well. It's 12 a
[4611.40s -> 4614.68s]  Skip to the next one done. Okay. Oh, we have symbols you ready?
[4615.80s -> 4619.80s]  Uh, yeah, uh ae trident stitches h or n
[4620.87s -> 4621.75s]  uh
[4621.75s -> 4624.50s]  Batman symbol batman symbol
[4624.58s -> 4633.48s]  What batman I heard the fucking music. I know we would be fucked. There's no fucking way. I could spit out that much shit
[4635.00s -> 4637.53s]  Maybe aquaman
[4637.53s -> 4640.73s]  All right, we got we got we're getting that done. So we got to keep tracking the amount. Okay. I got it
[4641.29s -> 4645.78s]  Mm-hmm. I got it. All right, so more morse code is not a problem for us now
[4645.78s -> 4648.90s]  I I think I think we got that down and the occurrence wires
[4648.98s -> 4654.10s]  I think we got two the thing we've got to be watching out watching out for though is we got those complicated wires
[4654.74s -> 4659.46s]  But I think I got that down with the venn diagram. So, all right, I I think we're we're we're these new
[4659.76s -> 4661.76s]  Complicated wires that have been you know
[4662.63s -> 4665.67s]  Generated for it. I think we're good. So next one. Here we go. I think we can do this
[4665.83s -> 4668.95s]  I think we're good. I think we got it this time. Yeah, I think we're so yeah. Yeah, absolutely
[4669.03s -> 4670.63s]  All right. Are you guys ready?
[4670.63s -> 4676.01s]  Are you ready? Are you ready? I'm ready, man. I'm ready, man. All right game boy with a word to spell
[4677.03s -> 4679.67s]  Okay, we're gonna be spelling out a word here. So we're gonna looking at the
[4680.31s -> 4684.22s]  This is called a uh, this is called the subject of password
[4684.22s -> 4687.74s]  So i'm gonna be writing down all the first ones in the first column, right? So get ready
[4687.98s -> 4691.66s]  I okay, here we go. Ready first first letter in the first column b
[4692.46s -> 4694.46s]  j b c
[4694.62s -> 4695.66s]  t
[4695.66s -> 4698.74s]  e d
[4698.74s -> 4700.74s]  So we're looking at bj ted
[4703.18s -> 4707.83s]  Yes, yes bj ted, correct. Okay bj ted second row
[4708.55s -> 4709.51s]  c
[4709.51s -> 4710.47s]  e
[4710.47s -> 4711.51s]  h
[4711.51s -> 4712.31s]  n
[4712.31s -> 4716.31s]  w s
[4716.31s -> 4723.51s]  So c e h n w s that's correct. Okay, so and the third ones are s
[4724.23s -> 4726.65s]  l n b
[4727.29s -> 4728.25s]  i
[4728.25s -> 4734.04s]  K. Okay. So the first one let's see here. Uh c b t ted
[4736.71s -> 4740.71s]  Uh t is anyone start with t
[4742.68s -> 4750.15s]  The word is think. Mm-hmm. I think so would make sense. Wouldn't it? No
[4750.63s -> 4758.23s]  Yes, it is. Nope work. It could be thing with the word is thing. The word is thing
[4758.39s -> 4763.61s]  All right, we got okay. What's code? Okay, we got morse code. All right, you ready now now keep in mind
[4763.69s -> 4768.49s]  I want you to like remember these so like and say comma in between so here we go
[4778.34s -> 4783.50s]  So we got a v yeah, yeah
[4785.86s -> 4787.76s]  Try putting in
[4787.76s -> 4796.28s]  3595 as a solution three five nine five. Okay
[4796.76s -> 4802.36s]  Uh, now we have the word game where like the there you uh, what? Huh? Okay. We I got that
[4802.44s -> 4805.72s]  So are you prepared? Huh? Okay. The first word is there
[4806.44s -> 4808.98s]  It is there like as in like
[4814.18s -> 4816.18s]  Okay, so middle right middle right
[4817.14s -> 4825.46s]  What with a question mark what what would the question work? Uh, so we got uh with three h's we got what four letters
[4825.94s -> 4826.90s]  left
[4826.90s -> 4832.39s]  Nothing ready. What is on here? But it's what I just asked. It's what I just said to you though
[4832.47s -> 4838.66s]  What with a question mark? Oh, yeah. No, no, no. What what is the word here? Okay. Oh, no, no, no
[4838.74s -> 4840.74s]  Okay, I got okay. Uh
[4841.85s -> 4847.91s]  Wait, okay. The word is there their pizza in the middle right sex spot is what you
[4848.63s -> 4854.07s]  Hold your with an apostrophe like what kind of single you or you you like you a person
[4855.67s -> 4863.45s]  Uh us in like three letters. Yes. Okay. It's there. Okay next next word. Okay, we have you it is y-o-u
[4863.61s -> 4865.75s]  You as a person you
[4865.75s -> 4870.22s]  Okay, uh, let's see here you are looking at uh, you
[4870.94s -> 4872.94s]  Middle right middle right no
[4874.39s -> 4875.27s]  blank
[4875.27s -> 4877.27s]  Uh three h's wait
[4877.91s -> 4886.52s]  First got it final final word is you again y-o-u you so we're looking at middle right again
[4887.00s -> 4892.76s]  You y-o-u the person you sure you are with a space in between
[4893.32s -> 4898.68s]  You're possessive you're with an apostrophe next. Okay. Yeah, we got it. All right. We got
[4899.16s -> 4904.36s]  Uh, we got one more and it's just it's the symbols like the half-life symbol thing right half-life symbol
[4905.00s -> 4907.16s]  All right, we have half-life symbol mirrored k
[4907.94s -> 4916.30s]  Sleepy three and a not filled in star. Okay, uh the x looking weird thing
[4918.46s -> 4920.30s]  we're looking at the uh
[4920.30s -> 4923.96s]  The three half-life and the weird star
[4924.92s -> 4931.94s]  sleepy three sleepy three
[4935.08s -> 4939.16s]  Yeah, it's like somebody just like was doing three and then they just fell asleep when they got to the end
[4941.67s -> 4945.27s]  We had a minute left to go that's about our best time by the way, that's good
[4945.67s -> 4949.51s]  You know, you know what though I think the morse code is really easy the problem with the morse code though is
[4949.83s -> 4951.83s]  Sometimes I can't do that logical
[4952.55s -> 4955.67s]  What is it called when you elimination where you're like, you know
[4957.11s -> 4962.47s]  Basically, the word was vector right? There's only one word like that. That's one v in it
[4962.63s -> 4966.07s]  So why I chose to do was just go v and then it's got to be vectors
[4966.07s -> 4968.07s]  I correspond with the frequency on it
[4968.07s -> 4970.79s]  But there might be several ones that start with t for example
[4971.03s -> 4974.07s]  That means I have to also get the second letter so I can't do up
[4974.31s -> 4979.19s]  I think it's process of elimination. I think it's called so uh, it's it's gonna the channels will ramp up
[4979.19s -> 4983.90s]  But don't don't worry. I think we got this this next one is called fair game
[4983.98s -> 4989.88s]  It's called no more hand holding remember everything you've learned because anything can appear on the bump. This is a big one
[4990.28s -> 4998.86s]  This is the uh, this is the gear check. This is five modules. It's five minutes. This is the this is the dps check
[4999.86s -> 5002.82s]  Dude, let me tell you i've been so nervous. I've been holding in this p I I
[5003.62s -> 5008.74s]  Now that I can relax like the the the the pp instincts are kicking. I gotta I gotta go i'm i'm sorry
[5010.46s -> 5013.11s]  You want to take p? All right. All right. We'll take it. Yes
[5013.51s -> 5017.27s]  Wait, are you are you like sprinting to go p or is this like let's take a break for two minutes?
[5017.75s -> 5029.80s]  Yes, which one? Yeah, you you are you you're or you're yes or yeah, which one i'm fucking pissing head on
[5033.19s -> 5039.56s]  Go pee with them now. No, i'm i'm i'm gonna take a long it's gonna take a lot longer for me guys
[5039.56s -> 5044.57s]  I take my time when I pee I I like arch my back. I like crack the neck
[5045.53s -> 5051.26s]  I like roll my shoulders a little bit. I look directly into the bowl for a full
[5052.14s -> 5054.14s]  10 seconds and I go. All right
[5054.81s -> 5057.40s]  That's that's where it's going right there
[5059.61s -> 5065.56s]  And then they're okay. I take my time. I don't I don't rush pee
[5072.18s -> 5074.18s]  Where else is it going?
[5074.42s -> 5076.98s]  Where else is it gonna go? You know what today?
[5077.62s -> 5081.06s]  Today I think i'm going right at the back wall. I think that's where i'm going today
[5088.58s -> 5098.09s]  No one wanted to know that this is how germa paints his house
[5099.86s -> 5105.08s]  Do the sentry noise?
[5105.08s -> 5107.80s]  I don't need to do the sentry noise right now. It's not necessary
[5123.53s -> 5127.77s]  This was like when you when you go somewhere with somebody and you don't have to pee but they do
[5128.81s -> 5130.81s]  And you just want to get to where you're going?
[5131.53s -> 5132.57s]  and
[5132.57s -> 5134.65s]  It's like hey man, let's get to go pee. You're like, all right
[5161.32s -> 5169.42s]  Whoa?
[5169.42s -> 5171.42s]  Why did it take you that long?
[5171.42s -> 5173.42s]  Why did it take you that long to start?
[5176.81s -> 5182.06s]  What are you doing? All right. All right. There we go. There we go. Did you pee into the corner?
[5182.46s -> 5185.66s]  Wait, did you did you go like a snack and then pee in the corner of your room?
[5186.70s -> 5191.18s]  No, I I didn't go I didn't go right. No, I didn't go pee. Anyway, uh, let's uh
[5192.22s -> 5194.60s]  Let us uh
[5194.60s -> 5196.60s]  Let's let's play some games. Uh
[5199.82s -> 5202.06s]  All right. Well now I uh now I gotta go pee
[5203.91s -> 5205.43s]  No, no, you don't
[5205.43s -> 5211.18s]  Let's go. This one's gonna be hard focus
[5212.06s -> 5217.26s]  Use everything you've learned. Um, I am yes you are you got it. You are
[5218.55s -> 5221.19s]  So smart and you've been a big my reading beast
[5221.91s -> 5223.88s]  Here we go
[5223.88s -> 5227.00s]  Uh, we're gonna do we have uh, what's the word game boy edition?
[5228.04s -> 5233.24s]  All right. What's the word? Here we go. We're gonna start kicking ass here. So tell me what uh, what is the first letter?
[5233.80s -> 5234.76s]  x
[5234.76s -> 5236.36s]  u w
[5236.36s -> 5238.36s]  y s i
[5240.76s -> 5244.36s]  Okay, let's see here. Um, second row v b
[5245.08s -> 5245.88s]  o
[5245.88s -> 5247.88s]  q y f
[5248.68s -> 5252.52s]  Okay, let's see here. Uh
[5252.52s -> 5254.52s]  See if anyone at starboard s
[5254.76s -> 5259.80s]  Okay, uh, does the third row have a u in it the third row?
[5260.60s -> 5262.60s]  Does not have a u in it
[5263.48s -> 5265.48s]  shit, okay, uh shit
[5268.34s -> 5271.86s]  Did the second row have a p in it second row?
[5272.02s -> 5274.02s]  No, i'm not making a joke
[5274.42s -> 5277.62s]  What the second row does not have those?
[5278.82s -> 5280.82s]  Okay, it does not have a p. Uh
[5281.22s -> 5288.65s]  Shit, this is gonna be really hard one
[5289.05s -> 5292.25s]  Uh, there's no t's either. Uh, does anyone start with w?
[5293.13s -> 5295.21s]  Yes. Yes, it's true. That could be could be that
[5295.77s -> 5300.97s]  I got it. I'll be you the word was world. Okay. Uh, Simon says what the fuck? Okay, Simon says
[5301.69s -> 5308.06s]  Uh ready Simon says, okay, whatever. I have to deduct that later on whatever. Yeah, so serial serial serial number is
[5309.02s -> 5311.02s]  Serial number is uh
[5311.58s -> 5313.67s]  What are you looking for a vowel?
[5313.67s -> 5315.94s]  Yes, no vowels
[5315.94s -> 5318.50s]  No vowel. Okay. So well what the color sequence is
[5321.13s -> 5323.74s]  green
[5323.74s -> 5327.82s]  green
[5327.82s -> 5331.54s]  green
[5331.54s -> 5333.54s]  That's the solution. Sorry what?
[5333.78s -> 5335.54s]  Oh, that's the solution
[5335.54s -> 5347.40s]  Okay, green green green green green green green green green green
[5347.96s -> 5350.97s]  What the fuck's going on? Okay done
[5351.45s -> 5353.05s]  Now we got okay, uh
[5353.05s -> 5354.81s]  We got the wire scenario. No, no, no
[5354.89s -> 5358.65s]  We've got the the the box with the number in it with the sequence you gotta remember the sequences
[5358.65s -> 5363.69s]  Okay, that that shit's easy because you you you're like an elephant. You remember everything anyway, uh, sorry
[5363.69s -> 5367.77s]  I want to say that but whatever let's just do occurrences or whatever. It's called right the complicated wires
[5368.33s -> 5371.61s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[5371.77s -> 5375.53s]  We're doing this is just the number with the the sequence the number in the in the box
[5375.85s -> 5378.89s]  You want to do the complicated wires? Yes, because that's hard one
[5381.74s -> 5383.02s]  Okay
[5383.02s -> 5385.02s]  Tell me which ones do we have?
[5385.34s -> 5386.14s]  we have
[5386.14s -> 5388.54s]  Uh, it's one two three a b c
[5389.70s -> 5391.70s]  And okay black red
[5392.26s -> 5393.38s]  Cut it
[5393.38s -> 5395.30s]  What cut it?
[5395.30s -> 5397.54s]  Cut the black wire. Okay, what else?
[5398.65s -> 5401.37s]  Red what else do we have red two c?
[5402.17s -> 5404.22s]  Cut that one, too
[5404.22s -> 5411.91s]  Next we have one black wire four to b four five six a b c four to b black wire skip skip skip
[5412.31s -> 5415.99s]  Next we have seven eight nine a b c blue red black
[5416.55s -> 5420.63s]  Blue seven goes to a this is the first this is the first blue one first blue wire of the game
[5421.11s -> 5424.36s]  Okay, skip that one. Don't skip the full thing. Don't skip that one
[5424.92s -> 5429.08s]  Like did you skip the thing? I did not skip it. I I I clicked it. It was a strike
[5430.26s -> 5432.26s]  Okay, shit now, okay
[5432.50s -> 5435.78s]  Okay, so when I say skip it, I didn't mean like skip the full whatever
[5436.74s -> 5440.66s]  So that was the blue one, right? Okay. So that this is the second red one second red one, right? No
[5441.62s -> 5447.78s]  Yep, second red wire second red wire and it's from a to eight to a
[5448.82s -> 5451.70s]  Okay, don't cut that one sen and then it will be the
[5452.84s -> 5455.24s]  Third black wire the second one. Sorry black third
[5455.88s -> 5461.40s]  It's the last wire is a black wire and it is the third black wire of the video game
[5462.44s -> 5464.44s]  Okay, what does that go to b?
[5465.59s -> 5468.65s]  Good that it
[5469.88s -> 5477.88s]  Final one is 10 11 12 a b c two blue wires one red blue blue red 10 a 11 b 12 b
[5478.44s -> 5481.80s]  But in terms of occurrences the blue one, this will be the third one
[5482.36s -> 5485.72s]  This would no this be the yes, this would be one two three
[5486.44s -> 5488.20s]  No
[5488.20s -> 5490.76s]  This would be the third two and three of blue wires. Yes
[5492.06s -> 5494.06s]  Okay, so uh third one. It doesn't go to b
[5495.82s -> 5497.50s]  It goes to a
[5497.50s -> 5499.50s]  Okay, don't cut that one
[5501.91s -> 5508.49s]  I we had three seconds. I had them. I we had three seconds. I was trying to guess
[5511.05s -> 5513.67s]  No guessing
[5513.67s -> 5517.75s]  How the fuck did you deduct that that member? Uh, what do you call it?
[5518.31s -> 5521.91s]  I just saw how do you just how I just saw w and just went with it
[5522.87s -> 5525.67s]  There was like there was like four fucking different ones
[5525.91s -> 5529.91s]  You had a 25 chance of winning and you you won. I think it was just on oh
[5529.99s -> 5532.87s]  I saw like the or and then I saw there was a w so I was like it's world
[5533.67s -> 5534.95s]  I guess man
[5534.95s -> 5539.83s]  Okay, i'm just telling you that's my don't do a cowboy move like that again. We we don't know what's gonna happen
[5541.26s -> 5543.26s]  Oh my god. All right. I won't do it again
[5543.82s -> 5544.70s]  Okay
[5544.70s -> 5545.58s]  Okay
[5545.58s -> 5550.30s]  So this one we're starting with we've got a new module, but it's remember we pick it up
[5550.78s -> 5554.70s]  Uh, it's the pac-man module thing with the with the red triangle and the lights
[5555.74s -> 5560.70s]  Okay, I remember when we did this last time. Okay, so we're gonna be referring to this as a b c d e f g
[5561.18s -> 5564.22s]  Right. Do you understand what I mean there? So when i'm saying numbers here
[5564.86s -> 5571.74s]  Uh, i'm saying like the the uh, the vertical ones i'm saying like alpha one you'll be in the first position if i'm saying
[5572.86s -> 5574.86s]  b2 that will be uh
[5575.66s -> 5580.78s]  Like yeah, like one over and down like one over and down. Yeah one over and down
[5581.18s -> 5585.18s]  So where did you spawn here? I spawned in alpha two
[5587.82s -> 5589.82s]  alpha two, okay, um
[5591.37s -> 5595.29s]  Okay, uh, and then um, we have two dots here. We have two dots here
[5595.45s -> 5599.53s]  Yes, where are they located? The two circles are located in
[5600.17s -> 5601.05s]  um
[5601.05s -> 5602.57s]  beta one
[5602.57s -> 5604.57s]  and beta six
[5605.06s -> 5608.98s]  Okay, beta one and beta six and you spawn in a two a two
[5611.13s -> 5616.17s]  Okay, and the light the light is in a b c is in
[5617.37s -> 5619.85s]  There was a delta delta six
[5621.03s -> 5623.03s]  Okay, then go down one
[5624.81s -> 5631.38s]  Uh, did it work? What's going on? I just went down. Why am I not moving? Did I go I did down twice?
[5632.10s -> 5634.79s]  What's going on? Why is it not moving?
[5635.43s -> 5639.48s]  Did you do this correctly?
[5639.48s -> 5642.20s]  You didn't you didn't confuse the red and white did you? I did
[5644.62s -> 5646.62s]  Oh, so we're
[5646.78s -> 5652.94s]  drama restarted I I didn't know I thought I thought that was us because it's everything every video game that's ever existed
[5653.26s -> 5659.34s]  You are the fucking triangle pointing in every single game. You're the triangle that's pointing. You're the triangle on the minimap every time
[5660.06s -> 5662.06s]  All right, just scratch it just go
[5662.38s -> 5664.14s]  Scratch it
[5664.14s -> 5668.46s]  You ready scratch it new. Let's kick ass. Let's kick ass. Let's kick its ass
[5669.18s -> 5673.02s]  We have a blue button that button says detonate on it
[5674.10s -> 5676.58s]  It says detonate. All right, so let's see here
[5677.22s -> 5678.82s]  uh
[5678.82s -> 5682.02s]  How many batteries do we have on this one? The amount of batteries are
[5682.74s -> 5684.74s]  We have one
[5685.91s -> 5688.33s]  battery one battery
[5688.33s -> 5690.49s]  And it says detonate detonate blue
[5692.46s -> 5696.46s]  Okay, but the problem is there is not more than one. There's just one not more than one
[5696.46s -> 5699.58s]  There is only one button here. It's a blue button that says detonate
[5702.14s -> 5705.18s]  It's a lit indicator on this one. There is it's on the right
[5707.00s -> 5709.00s]  Okay, does it say frk?
[5710.17s -> 5712.92s]  No, it says trn
[5713.00s -> 5714.33s]  Okay
[5714.33s -> 5718.57s]  Well, we're gonna be holding down this button. Okay yellow flashing light
[5719.70s -> 5724.42s]  Well five in any position. Okay, good. Very good five in any position. Let it go
[5725.06s -> 5728.10s]  Okay. Now we have a game boy find the word
[5728.82s -> 5730.82s]  Word scrambler. All right. Here we go
[5731.30s -> 5733.38s]  So i'm gonna be starting writing this down. So here we go
[5734.50s -> 5735.70s]  r
[5735.70s -> 5736.82s]  t
[5736.82s -> 5737.78s]  z
[5737.78s -> 5739.38s]  v s
[5739.38s -> 5740.18s]  i
[5740.18s -> 5741.69s]  Okay
[5741.69s -> 5743.45s]  next one p u
[5744.25s -> 5746.09s]  y t
[5746.09s -> 5748.09s]  m i
[5749.21s -> 5751.61s]  Okay, before we do that one, let's see here. Um
[5752.49s -> 5755.61s]  V v v v it's not a v words. No s s s s
[5756.25s -> 5758.33s]  Uh, bring me the third ones bring me the third ones
[5761.43s -> 5762.87s]  The word is study
[5762.87s -> 5768.55s]  Done. Okay. We have uh, we have we have symbols the the weird symbols with like the the t b and the k and the
[5769.11s -> 5774.47s]  Okay. Okay. Yeah, we we go. I got it. I gotta go for you. All right. Holy shit. You're really good at this
[5775.03s -> 5776.39s]  Okay, uh
[5776.39s -> 5780.71s]  So, uh, what are we looking at here? We're looking at the uh, the mirrored k
[5781.93s -> 5783.93s]  Uh the backwards p
[5785.10s -> 5789.48s]  Um, it's dark mirrored k backwards. What is dark?
[5790.12s -> 5794.04s]  uh, the lights turn off mirrored k backwards p t b and then um
[5795.32s -> 5800.20s]  An octopus holding a okay. I I I got I got I got you the what the fuck. Okay
[5800.68s -> 5807.00s]  Uh, do the backwards p do t b. Yep weird x
[5808.60s -> 5813.00s]  No, that's reverse and then that will be a spider with spear and then okay. Sorry. Okay. Okay. Okay
[5813.24s -> 5814.76s]  We got we got plenty of time
[5814.76s -> 5819.16s]  Uh, it's the it's the number with the thing in the middle the number of the big box with the number
[5819.48s -> 5822.12s]  Okay. Okay. No, no, no, no problem. No problem. The number is
[5823.00s -> 5824.81s]  four
[5824.81s -> 5826.41s]  fourth position
[5826.41s -> 5827.37s]  Okay
[5827.37s -> 5836.01s]  The number is two press the button the same position as pressing stage one same position same position
[5837.11s -> 5838.15s]  uh
[5838.15s -> 5839.91s]  Fuck I think it was four
[5839.91s -> 5844.95s]  I think yep. Okay. All right. Next number you're making me nervous is one. All right
[5847.94s -> 5853.14s]  Same label it same label as the president stage two same label as there's a stage two got it. Okay
[5853.94s -> 5855.94s]  The number is one again
[5856.42s -> 5859.06s]  Press the button the same position as the president stage one
[5860.02s -> 5865.54s]  Same position or the same position position position as state one. Yes, uh final number is one
[5866.26s -> 5870.04s]  Press the same button with the same label as the president stage one same label
[5870.92s -> 5875.24s]  Okay, we got one more module. This is the complicated wire is going to go horizontal one two three abc
[5875.48s -> 5880.20s]  Okay, okay. Let me let me talk into this one. Here we go. Here we go. All right, so we we got what?
[5880.84s -> 5882.12s]  black wire
[5882.12s -> 5884.34s]  only from two to see
[5884.34s -> 5886.97s]  Good. Okay next
[5886.97s -> 5889.85s]  We've got uh, this would be the second and third black wire
[5889.85s -> 5892.97s]  So we have two black wires one red four five six abc
[5893.69s -> 5899.53s]  Where's the second one go to the second black wire is going to a the second wire is going to be and it's red
[5901.43s -> 5905.59s]  So the first okay, so don't cut the first wire. Do not cut the first wire
[5906.39s -> 5907.35s]  Okay
[5907.35s -> 5910.71s]  The okay, so give me the give me the there was another second black one, right?
[5910.71s -> 5914.31s]  It's the second black wire is going to a it's in the third. It's it's it's six to eight
[5914.79s -> 5917.27s]  Skip that skip skip that one skip this whole thing and then we got what?
[5917.59s -> 5921.51s]  Okay. Now we have one red wire two blues red blue blue
[5922.31s -> 5928.39s]  And the current in current this will be uh, the the second would be this would be the second red wire
[5929.19s -> 5931.35s]  Does that go to a or c this one goes to a?
[5932.50s -> 5933.62s]  Cut it
[5933.62s -> 5935.62s]  That's not correct. Um, that's okay
[5936.02s -> 5938.02s]  We have two blue wires. Oh
[5942.82s -> 5945.30s]  Just getting hard now son. Oh, that was it too
[5946.10s -> 5949.46s]  That was close
[5949.46s -> 5950.50s]  Okay
[5950.50s -> 5952.90s]  Well, i'll tell you what man the word scrambler thing
[5953.62s -> 5960.26s]  I you're a fucking genius at it. Like unironically you are amazing at this. I I don't I I think I think i think i'm
[5960.26s -> 5962.26s]  I think i'm just a little strange
[5962.26s -> 5964.34s]  You know, you know, you got that one thing that you can do
[5965.46s -> 5969.54s]  I'm writing this down like, okay, let's see here. Uh w like and you're fucking
[5969.94s -> 5971.05s]  Like
[5971.05s -> 5974.17s]  Going through it. I don't know if I could do that every time look you're amazing, man
[5974.97s -> 5976.97s]  I think I think it's just a little strange
[5977.37s -> 5982.25s]  Dude, i'll tell you what man. I'll tell you what if if nasa needs like a word scrambling man
[5982.81s -> 5984.41s]  This streaming shit
[5984.41s -> 5986.41s]  Ben, all right, you're going to space buddy
[5987.13s -> 5988.87s]  Thanks
[5988.87s -> 5989.91s]  Wow
[5989.91s -> 5991.91s]  Word scrambler. Don't worry. I'll take care of this
[5994.86s -> 5997.03s]  If you actually do this
[5997.03s -> 6001.35s]  Tell me i'm not gonna help you this time because you are so good at this friend. You're so good at this
[6008.89s -> 6010.65s]  Isn't he amazing guys?
[6010.65s -> 6022.81s]  It's probably fucking solving it in any fucking second. What watch this five
[6023.45s -> 6024.41s]  four
[6024.41s -> 6025.37s]  three
[6025.37s -> 6026.25s]  two
[6026.25s -> 6027.13s]  one
[6027.13s -> 6032.65s]  germa
[6032.65s -> 6035.13s]  Here we go. Five four
[6035.69s -> 6036.65s]  three
[6036.65s -> 6039.69s]  Two one germa moss moss
[6047.02s -> 6050.54s]  God, this is one like the guinness book world record shows up at your house and you can't do it
[6051.26s -> 6055.02s]  You're you're the master at this and everyone realizes that he wasn't real
[6056.95s -> 6058.95s]  No, you can do this you're really good at this
[6059.51s -> 6079.27s]  Germa, what are you doing? Keep from uh
[6083.05s -> 6085.94s]  time
[6085.94s -> 6091.96s]  Oh good. Uh, I I it was like a full minute and a half that we just threw away
[6091.96s -> 6093.96s]  All right, let's do it again again again again

[6104.71s -> 6108.31s]  Okay, we've got double pac-man double pac-man game with the thing
[6109.27s -> 6113.75s]  Give me two dots. Give me two dots the two. All right, we've got two circles are in a two
[6114.47s -> 6115.51s]  and then
[6116.42s -> 6118.07s]  F3
[6118.07s -> 6120.95s]  Okay, gotcha. Okay. Where do you spawn? I spawned in
[6121.99s -> 6123.74s]  D6
[6123.74s -> 6128.06s]  And the light okay, and the goal is the goal is in e1
[6128.78s -> 6134.63s]  So you spawned in did you spawn in d6? I spawned in d6
[6136.34s -> 6139.70s]  D6, okay, correct. So you want to go up? Yep
[6141.78s -> 6143.46s]  And you want to go, uh
[6143.46s -> 6147.69s]  Up. Yep. Nope. We spawned in d6
[6148.47s -> 6149.93s]  a b c d
[6149.93s -> 6152.17s]  1 2 3 4 5 6 d6

[6162.39s -> 6163.75s]  a 2
[6163.75s -> 6165.75s]  and f3 for the circles
[6166.31s -> 6168.66s]  and
[6168.66s -> 6180.70s]  E1 for the goal something's wrong here. What's wrong? Something is wrong here. Uh,
[6181.34s -> 6183.10s]  E1 is the goal
[6183.10s -> 6188.78s]  A2 okay, uh bottom bottom bottom. Tell fucking redo this redo this one redo this one. Okay

[6211.83s -> 6214.87s]  they were just the guy was sitting there like with a pen in his mouth just like
[6217.70s -> 6219.86s]  You won't be part of the academy and they left
[6220.94s -> 6222.94s]  Well, you're going to space with your fucking
[6223.18s -> 6226.30s]  Password solving skills, man. I hope so one day
[6226.94s -> 6229.50s]  Okay, here we go
[6229.50s -> 6232.54s]  We have a pat was pac-man game. Let's get this right
[6233.56s -> 6237.40s]  Okay. Okay, let's go. So what do we have the dots on are these little like green?
[6237.88s -> 6240.44s]  little green circles, okay, we have d4
[6241.56s -> 6245.24s]  Mm-hmm and f4 d4. Okay f4
[6246.18s -> 6248.90s]  Gotcha and you are spawning in I am an a6
[6250.49s -> 6255.37s]  a6 okay, and you want to go to the goal at the goal that I would like to go to is an e1
[6258.20s -> 6260.60s]  Okay, so you want to go right right right
[6261.93s -> 6273.69s]  Yep, go as long as bottom as you can. Okay, go right

[6399.02s -> 6400.84s]  uh
[6400.84s -> 6404.12s]  The candy cane wires the vertical wires with the stars and lights and the
[6404.68s -> 6406.84s]  Okay, not not a problem man. Not a problem here. Uh
[6407.48s -> 6409.48s]  Let's see here. So we're looking at uh
[6411.29s -> 6416.12s]  There's six wires shit. Okay. Let me let me read this. We have time

[6647.34s -> 6653.34s]  Hold hold hold you are with a space in between the letter. There it is done
[6653.74s -> 6656.34s]  Okay, next word the next word is
[6657.06s -> 6664.47s]  Blank b-l-a-n-k blank so blank. Okay, here we go. Uh, where is this one?
[6666.49s -> 6670.81s]  Okay, we're look middle right middle right read me the letter u just the letter u
[6671.82s -> 6677.35s]  Uh-huh. Yeah on space, huh on space, huh? Yes. Yes. Yes
[6679.40s -> 6686.02s]  Okay, now we have the it's read like you're reading a book r-e-a-d read, okay, uh read read
[6686.10s -> 6692.47s]  Okay, middle right middle right blank. Okay blank blank blank. Here we go
[6695.13s -> 6696.89s]  Wait, right
[6696.89s -> 6698.89s]  Okay, four letters got a metal
[6699.37s -> 6705.77s]  Okay, gotcha got it. Next we have uh, the sequence of of the annoying wires the horizontal ones the ones are like, oh black
[6706.73s -> 6711.91s]  Red, okay. So first one first red one first red one. So red is going to see cut it
[6712.55s -> 6715.91s]  Okay, second wire is red also going to be cut it
[6716.47s -> 6719.45s]  The last wire is a black wire going to c cut it
[6719.93s -> 6721.45s]  Okay
[6721.45s -> 6725.45s]  Next we have a black wire going to a and a blue wire going to c
[6725.85s -> 6730.25s]  Four to a the black wire cut the black wire. Okay blue wire is going to c six c
[6730.25s -> 6734.49s]  It's the third slot and that is the first one we've seen that's the first blue wire
[6735.70s -> 6738.74s]  And do not cut that one skip to the next round next round
[6739.14s -> 6744.79s]  We have two blue wires going from seven to c and then nine to a two blues
[6744.87s -> 6749.03s]  The first cut the uh, wait, this is the this is the first blue wire. Yes
[6749.19s -> 6754.52s]  No, this would be these these would be the second third blue wire second. This would be the second, right?
[6754.76s -> 6760.54s]  This one here would be the second blue wire. Okay. Does that go to c? Yes cut that one
[6761.27s -> 6765.75s]  Next is the third blue wire and it's going it's going to a skip that one
[6766.38s -> 6769.74s]  Okay, finally, we have a fourth blue wire going to b
[6770.30s -> 6777.59s]  And then we have fourth occurrence blue wire fourth occurrence blue wire. Does that go to b? Yes cut it
[6778.23s -> 6780.23s]  At this incorrect, okay
[6781.27s -> 6786.95s]  So we have a black and red wire next both going to c black c so the black wire
[6787.80s -> 6790.60s]  Occurrence for black wire would be that would be the
[6791.56s -> 6794.25s]  Sec the third black wire
[6794.25s -> 6797.93s]  Does that go to b does that go to b that third black wire goes to c?
[6798.33s -> 6803.19s]  Let's get that one and the red one will be what occurrence the red wire is also going to c
[6803.75s -> 6805.45s]  And it would be
[6805.45s -> 6812.01s]  The third occurrence of red skip that one skip that one skip it all. Okay, that should be it. Yes, it's done
[6812.90s -> 6817.54s]  Okay. Now we just have we just have a word a word jumbler. You do it. You are the master
[6817.70s -> 6825.22s]  You are the master jerma go activate go. That's not goofy. The word's not goofy. I thought it was goofy

[6903.80s -> 6905.80s]  Let's be slow and just you know
[6908.06s -> 6909.10s]  All right
[6909.10s -> 6910.38s]  Here we go
[6910.38s -> 6917.78s]  Morse code we got a morse code. All right, let me let me get in position for this one. All right. All right, so
[6918.42s -> 6922.50s]  Uh, we are going to do some morse coding. All right, so here we go. Uh, you're ready to read

[7483.86s -> 7485.86s]  Uh, does the second one go to b? Yes
[7487.03s -> 7489.91s]  Uh skip that one and uh the third one
[7490.79s -> 7493.91s]  Skip this one skip the one go to the next one. Okay, we have two black wires
[7495.40s -> 7497.40s]  Okay, uh, first one goes to c
[7497.40s -> 7501.96s]  Okay, uh the third go to a no third one goes to b two black wires third one goes to b skip that
[7501.96s -> 7504.92s]  Okay, it's a fourth fourth one goes that's go to c. It's all three
[7506.04s -> 7516.47s]  Okay, skip this one. Skip this one. Fuck it. Last one is to c black wire in the middle to c
[7517.75s -> 7536.68s]  How many seconds we're left point two eight. Oh god
[7537.42s -> 7541.74s]  I don't know if I fucking nerves can take this point point two eight, uh, three tenths of a second
[7544.50s -> 7547.58s]  Holy shit
[7547.58s -> 7549.58s]  That was um, that was a
[7550.76s -> 7553.32s]  That was tricky, you know, you know what you just fucking did
[7554.04s -> 7559.72s]  Jerma wild guest until I got it, right you you you made a hollywood move like you did some sort of like
[7560.20s -> 7564.44s]  Hollywood shit where you're like you're sweating sweat coming on your face. You're like what fucking wire is it?
[7564.60s -> 7566.68s]  Just fucking rip them all out, you know
[7568.49s -> 7569.45s]  Oh
[7569.45s -> 7572.41s]  That was wild. Hey, we beat we beat the gear check though
[7573.37s -> 7574.89s]  No, that's true
[7574.89s -> 7579.98s]  So what are we looking at now? Uh, that's why that's that's why that's the gear check because the next one
[7580.86s -> 7583.98s]  Uh is also five modules, but here's the difference
[7585.02s -> 7587.74s]  It's two minutes and 30 seconds instead of five minutes
[7591.98s -> 7594.87s]  uh, so the exact same thing we just did but
[7595.75s -> 7597.27s]  we have
[7597.27s -> 7599.67s]  50 we have a full 50 percent less time
[7600.76s -> 7603.16s]  I wonder how the modules i'll tell you i'll tell you what though
[7604.04s -> 7605.56s]  Before we do that one
[7605.56s -> 7609.96s]  Can we do another practice round by ie instead of doing the mission here?
[7609.96s -> 7614.68s]  How about we do a free play and we clock up the time a little bit or something like that not a bad idea
[7615.96s -> 7619.16s]  Because I feel like if we're gonna tackle a challenge like that. We need a little bit
[7619.80s -> 7621.64s]  You know extra
[7621.64s -> 7629.40s]  That's too much. Um, what do these mean? Well people saying it's easier. Let me see. Um, oh, it's easier modules
[7629.56s -> 7634.09s]  It's not hard modules. Apparently apparently it's like a bunch of really easy ones
[7636.52s -> 7639.40s]  Yeah, they say it's not it's not hard ones. It's easy modules
[7640.12s -> 7645.00s]  Okay, well I think we can do that one I think we can do that one see if it just simon says shit fine
[7645.08s -> 7650.36s]  But when it comes down to like the wire ones the horizontal wires the occurrences fuck me up
[7651.08s -> 7653.08s]  the occurrences fuck me up because uh
[7654.10s -> 7656.10s]  Basically, i'm unsure of myself because I have to do
[7657.28s -> 7660.42s]  Definitive answers. I can't just say eh and I have to be like, okay
[7660.42s -> 7663.38s]  What was it what was it and I have to just like manually think you know
[7663.38s -> 7670.63s]  So actually hilarious that it took us about an hour and a half to do the first two or three missions in the game
[7671.66s -> 7673.50s]  And it's been two hours
[7673.50s -> 7675.18s]  and we have done
[7675.18s -> 7680.79s]  What like eight missions? Well, uh, you know, I think we found what I really
[7681.51s -> 7683.99s]  Uh, yeah, I think I think me being the the reading man
[7683.99s -> 7687.83s]  Are you being the fucking cowboy here with the bruce willis the bomb defusal shit? Yes
[7688.23s -> 7700.79s]  I think I think it works. All right, you ready to try this one five modules two minutes 30 seconds. All right
[7701.66s -> 7705.19s]  I'm ready. Okay. Hopefully they're easy. Okay
[7710.44s -> 7715.40s]  Regular wires there are six regular wires. How many do we have? It's six wires six wires. It's sick
[7715.40s -> 7718.44s]  It's mcdonald's so it's four red two yellow
[7719.32s -> 7722.20s]  Yellow is in the first slot red is in the last one. How many yellow do we have?
[7722.36s -> 7727.08s]  We have two yellows. The first wire is yellow. The last wire is red four red two yellow
[7727.80s -> 7730.55s]  So we have okay, uh

[8041.67s -> 8047.75s]  It's not they're not gonna have like the girls in the in like the hooters out like shirts and like sneakers and stuff
[8048.63s -> 8049.91s]  Okay
[8049.91s -> 8052.79s]  Uh, who told you this?
[8052.79s -> 8054.79s]  it's i'm just curious because uh
[8055.35s -> 8059.27s]  You know, I I see these american brands and i'm thinking what do americans think?
[8059.35s -> 8062.55s]  Okay, now that we played american football my good friend
[8062.71s -> 8067.19s]  Let us hit up hooters and eat some chicken wings with buffalo sauce my good friend
[8067.77s -> 8070.97s]  Well, I mean that's that's kind of like a cartoon way to look at an american
[8071.37s -> 8073.61s]  uh, but no, no, no
[8074.65s -> 8084.28s]  We roll our sandwiches out with rolling pins and um, and then we eat them covered in mayonnaise. So it's not wrong
[8084.44s -> 8086.28s]  It's that's wrong
[8086.28s -> 8088.28s]  That is wrong. I I
[8088.76s -> 8094.71s]  Uh, I don't go to hooters. In fact, they're closing them. No, they're closing them all down
[8095.94s -> 8101.46s]  Okay. Well, what is what is your favorite? Uh chain restaurant in america? I'm asking this for for cultural
[8102.18s -> 8112.92s]  Culinary knowledge exchange. That's not that's not funny in america best fast food in america. Uh, I don't know
[8114.36s -> 8117.70s]  I I love mcdonald's I really do
[8118.26s -> 8124.52s]  I actually really love mcdonald's. What's what's your favorite thing at mcdonald's? Uh, that's simple mcchicken
[8124.68s -> 8127.94s]  Just a plain just a plain mcchicken
[8128.26s -> 8134.66s]  Or hot or mcdoubles the mcdoubles is the fuck. How do you how do you feel? How do you feel about those sesame seed?
[8134.82s -> 8138.57s]  Uh regular cheeseburgers the small ones for like a dollar sure. Yeah
[8139.91s -> 8144.95s]  Okay, here's the thing. Those are less than a dollar sometimes when I buy games on steam on stream stuff like that
[8144.95s -> 8152.63s]  And it's a waste. It's a waste time and whatever I equate my losses in what how many cheeseburgers could have gotten at mcdonald's
[8152.87s -> 8158.68s]  Versus buying this game. So standard mcdonald's cheeseburger is like probably the best one. Yeah for sure
[8160.47s -> 8166.70s]  Well, why the fuck are we talking about? We should be solving. Sorry. Well, it's a nice little segue mcdonald's is I guess but it's good
[8167.98s -> 8174.31s]  But i'll tell you what i'll tell you what, um, what is the worst place to go if you're hungry on a fast food situation
[8174.71s -> 8179.90s]  Burger king is terrible. Really burger king is dog shit like taco bell. Somebody said taco bell
[8180.38s -> 8183.26s]  Taco bell is like one of my favorite places but burger king sucks
[8184.22s -> 8190.06s]  Doesn't burger king have that like, you know, they had a commercial with return of the mac, you know burger king mac and cheetos
[8190.14s -> 8193.34s]  Whatever. Um, yeah, but you eat one and then you go
[8193.34s -> 8195.18s]  That was kind of good and you eat a second one and you go
[8195.18s -> 8200.92s]  I don't want these ever again and you don't order them ever again burger king has this thing where they make a menu item
[8200.92s -> 8205.10s]  That you will order once and never fucking order ever again. It's half their menu
[8205.91s -> 8207.91s]  I got like the chicken cheetos
[8207.91s -> 8213.83s]  The chicken fries the cheetos fries the cheese the mac and cheese bombs you eat it once and you never fucking order it again
[8213.83s -> 8217.64s]  Half the menu goes uneaten germa germa. I just thought of something amazing
[8218.12s -> 8223.93s]  I've been talking about something on stream for years hard attack grill. You live in vegas now
[8224.09s -> 8230.39s]  Yes, do you know about this do you weigh over 350 pounds do I sound like I do I don't know
[8231.03s -> 8237.34s]  No, if you eat if you weigh over 350 pounds
[8238.14s -> 8241.90s]  You eat everything for free at the hard attack grill in las vegas
[8242.63s -> 8246.31s]  It is free germa your meal is have you ever been there? Have you ever been there?
[8246.39s -> 8251.51s]  I have never been to I have walked by it many times, but I have never been inside the restaurant
[8252.39s -> 8254.39s]  I'll tell you what i'll tell you what
[8254.86s -> 8259.42s]  Uh, this is this is a question you come to vegas you want you want to get weighed and go to the hard attack grill
[8260.18s -> 8264.82s]  No, no, this is a question more for germa's chat right now. I i'm out i'm reading my chat right now
[8264.82s -> 8266.70s]  But i'll ask you guys a question
[8266.70s -> 8269.50s]  Would it not be the best thing ever to see germa?
[8269.90s -> 8275.27s]  Just go and eat at a hard attack grill put him in one of those like surgical dresses and just like
[8275.67s -> 8279.43s]  Eat onion rings until he has a coma, you know, I can eat I can eat a lot though
[8279.43s -> 8283.43s]  That's the thing people get surprised whenever they whenever I eat food around people. Okay, mr
[8283.43s -> 8287.51s]  Big shove i'll tell you what let's put your your your your money where your mouth is
[8287.91s -> 8290.79s]  Let's head down to hard attack grill and let's obliterate
[8291.51s -> 8296.71s]  15 plates of fries and let's see who truly is a gamer you ready?
[8298.12s -> 8302.76s]  Maybe not now, but I at some point I can eat a lot of food. I can eat a lot of food
[8302.84s -> 8305.72s]  I told you my order everybody everybody in my chat knows the order
[8306.22s -> 8308.86s]  They know my order and they think it's a joke and i've told it's
[8309.66s -> 8315.90s]  A big mac number one like two mcchickens and two double cheeseburgers and I eat it every time in a large fry and a large soda
[8318.49s -> 8323.11s]  And the large soda. Yes an extra dip extra dip. Anyway
[8324.39s -> 8327.67s]  Don't worry about it. Anyway, my point being i'll tell you what do you want to do?
[8327.91s -> 8331.19s]  Uh a wager here. Do you want to do a little bet? You don't want to do this?
[8331.19s -> 8334.55s]  I'm telling you i'm just trying to be honest with you. Don't want to do this. You really don't know
[8335.35s -> 8340.47s]  Germa germa, how about this here's a proposal you made the friends of mine call me friends of mine call me the bird
[8341.43s -> 8345.11s]  Because they can't understand how I eat like six times my body weight
[8345.43s -> 8348.95s]  They're like you fucking bird and I i'm like what are you talking about?
[8349.43s -> 8353.51s]  I I I just pictured you like vomiting into your friend's mouth after you've been eating so much
[8354.23s -> 8358.55s]  I don't know why the fuck whatever the point being I have a bet for you. I have a bet for you
[8358.63s -> 8363.70s]  Okay, uh, i'll hear it and you may decline and there's nothing nothing bad about it
[8364.02s -> 8368.33s]  That if we can solve the next bomb even though we've been challenged at this
[8369.26s -> 8373.98s]  You will at some point as a joke or whatever it is go to heart attack grill
[8374.06s -> 8376.78s]  You don't have to overeat just go there and be like
[8377.34s -> 8381.90s]  Just be a patron of the heart attack grill just show them the world
[8383.26s -> 8385.26s]  Do I have to stream going to the heart attack grill?
[8385.90s -> 8391.90s]  No, you can film it or do whatever you want just just to be like I have the privilege of living in in elvist town

[8407.54s -> 8413.88s]  This sounds like a losing scenario. Like if you lose you have to do this. Okay. Well, okay
[8414.20s -> 8420.07s]  But here's the thing we are guaranteed to lose i'm saying if by some chance we and we have to play
[8422.36s -> 8426.28s]  Okay, but if we win you have to just eat an elvis burger

[9339.59s -> 9344.87s]  But do I have to keep eating four of those? I can't eat four of those that I just said that out of anger
[9346.06s -> 9350.06s]  Well, okay. How about this? How about this? I have a proposal you go to heart attack real

[9541.18s -> 9546.62s]  So it's four numbers that you have to remember out of order and then like the position in the labels
[9547.10s -> 9548.06s]  I can't do it
[9548.06s -> 9551.82s]  I ate captain crunch every day when I was like from eight to fucking 14

[10156.98s -> 10159.98s]  We have eight modules and it's gonna take eight minutes.
[10159.98s -> 10161.34s]  It says, take your time, relax.
[10161.34s -> 10162.74s]  Then it says, don't relax.
[10162.74s -> 10167.56s]  If we can do this in one minute each, no problem.
[10167.56s -> 10168.80s]  The bomb tend to stream.
[10169.86s -> 10170.98s]  There's no stakes here.
[10170.98s -> 10171.82s]  It's just a matter of,
[10171.82s -> 10174.30s]  can we clear this monstrosity, you know?
[10174.30s -> 10175.70s]  All right, if we beat this,
[10176.78s -> 10178.94s]  if we beat this first try,
[10178.94s -> 10186.11s]  then all we have to do is when you visit Las Vegas,
[10186.11s -> 10187.19s]  we have to take a picture
[10187.19s -> 10189.67s]  in front of like the Bellagio fountain.
[10189.67s -> 10190.99s]  You're cutting out what?
[10190.99s -> 10193.43s]  I said, okay, if we do this one first try,
[10193.43s -> 10195.27s]  then when you come to Vegas,
[10195.27s -> 10197.07s]  all we have to do is take a picture
[10197.07s -> 10200.27s]  in front of the Bellagio fountain.
[10200.27s -> 10201.59s]  The Bellagio fountain, what?
[10201.59s -> 10204.36s]  Yeah, it's like a tourist place.
[10205.16s -> 10207.32s]  There's a big, big, big connotation here.
[10207.32s -> 10209.04s]  When I come?
[10209.04s -> 10210.44s]  Yeah.
[10210.44s -> 10212.26s]  When I come?
[10212.26s -> 10214.21s]  You don't wanna come?
[10214.21s -> 10215.61s]  I'd love to come.
[10215.61s -> 10216.77s]  I'd love to come.
[10216.77s -> 10217.61s]  There he's going.
[10217.61s -> 10220.37s]  But, but, but, all right, okay, I was,
[10220.37s -> 10224.38s]  okay, yeah, I'll go to the fountain, man.
[10224.38s -> 10226.47s]  You gotta beat the first try, though.
[10226.47s -> 10228.71s]  All right, yeah, absolutely, absolutely, man.
[10228.71s -> 10232.72s]  Yeah, I'm brockin' raw McDonald's.
[10232.72s -> 10235.04s]  Eight modules, let's go.
[10235.04s -> 10239.51s]  We have Morse code.
[10239.51s -> 10241.63s]  Morse code, all right, let's see here.
[10241.63s -> 10242.51s]  We gotta quickly do this.
[10242.51s -> 10243.63s]  Let's not fuck around for this one.
[10243.63s -> 10244.95s]  All right, so the first letter is,
[10244.95s -> 10246.87s]  let me, you know, the usual shit.
[10246.87s -> 10248.58s]  Usual shit, okay.
[10248.58s -> 10256.95s]  And he's like dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dash.
[10256.95s -> 10261.09s]  So dot, dot, dot, dot, dash.
[10261.09s -> 10266.50s]  So the first one, dot, dot, dot, comma, dot, dash.
[10266.50s -> 10267.62s]  No, it can't be that.
[10267.62s -> 10269.86s]  Then it would be sa, sa.
[10269.86s -> 10273.24s]  I don't have any sas, do I?
[10273.24s -> 10274.56s]  No, that can't be right, man.
[10274.56s -> 10276.70s]  Is that a correct call?
[10276.70s -> 10285.78s]  No.
[10285.78s -> 10291.59s]  Dot, dot, dot, dot, dash, dot, dot, okay.
[10291.63s -> 10295.65s]  Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dash, dot, dot.
[10295.65s -> 10303.47s]  So dot, dot, dot, comma, dot, dash, dot, dot.
[10303.47s -> 10311.29s]  Dot, dot, dot, comma, dot, dash, dot, dot.
[10311.29s -> 10315.14s]  It's three, five, two, two.
[10315.14s -> 10318.14s]  All right, we have the horizontal cut the wires thing.
[10318.14s -> 10318.98s]  We're gonna do this twice in a row.
[10318.98s -> 10319.82s]  Complicated bullshit.
[10319.82s -> 10321.62s]  Complicated bullshit, we have plenty of time to do this,
[10321.62s -> 10322.46s]  but we're gonna do this two of them.
[10322.46s -> 10324.47s]  Okay, let's go, here we go.
[10324.47s -> 10325.43s]  So what are we lookin' at?
[10325.43s -> 10331.46s]  Two blue wires, blue, blue, both going into A.
[10331.46s -> 10332.86s]  Those two go to A.
[10332.86s -> 10334.19s]  Yes.
[10334.19s -> 10335.59s]  Cut that one.
[10335.59s -> 10336.78s]  Cut it?
[10336.78s -> 10338.44s]  Next one.
[10338.44s -> 10340.50s]  Okay, we have another blue wire.
[10340.50s -> 10344.06s]  This one is going to A in the third slot.
[10344.06s -> 10346.02s]  Okay, is there any more wires on this one?
[10346.02s -> 10348.69s]  It's only blue.
[10348.69s -> 10350.65s]  Skip to the next round.
[10350.65s -> 10355.82s]  Okay, so this would be the fourth and fifth blue wire here,
[10355.82s -> 10357.22s]  so blue, blue, red.
[10357.22s -> 10359.94s]  So what current is on the red wire here, sorry.
[10359.94s -> 10362.94s]  The red wire is, yeah, this red is first,
[10362.94s -> 10364.94s]  and it goes to C.
[10364.94s -> 10366.29s]  Cut that one.
[10366.29s -> 10369.55s]  Okay, we also have the fourth and fifth blue wires,
[10369.55s -> 10371.68s]  both are going to A.
[10371.68s -> 10373.00s]  So fourth is going to A.
[10373.00s -> 10374.57s]  Yes.
[10374.57s -> 10375.41s]  Cut that one.
[10375.41s -> 10377.58s]  Okay.
[10377.58s -> 10379.98s]  And this is the fifth one, and it's going to where?
[10379.98s -> 10381.44s]  A.
[10381.44s -> 10383.66s]  Next round.
[10383.66s -> 10386.66s]  So we have a sixth blue wire here, it's the last one,
[10386.66s -> 10388.98s]  but we also have a black and red wire.
[10388.98s -> 10391.52s]  Black is first, it's going to C.
[10391.52s -> 10392.36s]  Cut the blue wire.
[10392.36s -> 10394.02s]  Is that it?
[10394.02s -> 10395.58s]  What occurrence is the red wire at?
[10395.58s -> 10399.34s]  The red wire is second, and it is going to A.
[10399.34s -> 10400.54s]  Okay, don't bother with it.
[10400.66s -> 10401.90s]  And the black one is at?
[10401.90s -> 10404.26s]  It's going to C.
[10404.26s -> 10405.10s]  First spot.
[10405.10s -> 10407.22s]  Okay, and the current is first ever.
[10407.22s -> 10409.10s]  That's the first ever black wire, yes.
[10409.10s -> 10410.70s]  Cut the black wire.
[10410.70s -> 10411.71s]  Done?
[10411.71s -> 10412.55s]  Next one, next one.
[10412.55s -> 10413.37s]  Okay, that's it.
[10413.37s -> 10414.39s]  All right, next one.
[10414.39s -> 10416.27s]  Same deal, we're gonna start it over.
[10416.27s -> 10418.11s]  Completely fresh, same module.
[10418.11s -> 10419.71s]  Whenever you see the first ever,
[10419.71s -> 10421.63s]  just cut the black one.
[10421.63s -> 10425.34s]  Okay, so we have black, black, blue.
[10425.34s -> 10427.46s]  Yep, cut that one, cut the first one.
[10427.46s -> 10429.44s]  Cut the first black wire?
[10429.44s -> 10433.16s]  Okay, now we have a black wire going from two to B.
[10433.72s -> 10434.56s]  Don't bother with that.
[10434.56s -> 10435.38s]  Blue?
[10435.38s -> 10437.63s]  Blue, yes, going to A.
[10437.63s -> 10440.15s]  Don't cut that one, next one.
[10440.15s -> 10442.39s]  This is the third and fourth black wire.
[10442.39s -> 10444.43s]  Only black wires, there's two of them.
[10444.43s -> 10446.07s]  One is going to C, one's going to B.
[10446.07s -> 10447.53s]  Skip the first one,
[10447.53s -> 10449.65s]  and this will be the fourth one, right?
[10449.65s -> 10452.20s]  This would be the fourth one going to B.
[10452.20s -> 10453.82s]  Okay, skip that one too.
[10453.82s -> 10457.30s]  Okay, only one wire on this one.
[10457.30s -> 10459.67s]  It is red, it's going to A.
[10459.67s -> 10461.71s]  And that will be our first one too.
[10461.71s -> 10464.11s]  That will be, that's the first red wire.
[10464.11s -> 10464.99s]  Yes, that's correct.
[10464.99s -> 10466.83s]  Okay, and that's going to?
[10466.83s -> 10468.34s]  A.
[10469.71s -> 10473.27s]  Okay, the last panel here is the fifth and sixth black wire
[10473.27s -> 10474.15s]  and then a blue wire.
[10474.15s -> 10477.03s]  So it's black, black, blue, fifth and sixth black wire.
[10477.03s -> 10478.51s]  Blue is going to B.
[10478.51s -> 10479.35s]  Is sixth going to B?
[10479.35s -> 10480.17s]  Is sixth going to B?
[10480.17s -> 10482.69s]  The last black, yes, it's going to B.
[10482.69s -> 10483.77s]  Cut that one.
[10483.77s -> 10485.43s]  Okay.
[10485.43s -> 10487.71s]  And the blue one was the first one we had.
[10487.71s -> 10491.91s]  The blue one is, the first wire here is black going to A.
[10491.91s -> 10495.03s]  The blue wire here is the third one going to B.
[10495.03s -> 10496.83s]  Okay, and it's going to B.
[10496.83s -> 10498.27s]  Yes, and this is, by the way,
[10498.27s -> 10499.87s]  this is the second blue wire.
[10500.39s -> 10502.91s]  So the last one is blue, cut that one.
[10502.91s -> 10504.19s]  Last one is blue.
[10504.19s -> 10505.59s]  That was incorrect, but it's okay.
[10505.59s -> 10507.59s]  Just go, just go, man.
[10507.59s -> 10510.05s]  That's it, all right, all right, Simon says.
[10510.05s -> 10513.14s]  Okay, Simon says, all right, here we go.
[10513.14s -> 10515.67s]  We have one strike, we have one strike.
[10515.67s -> 10516.79s]  One strike, vowel.
[10516.79s -> 10517.63s]  And there is a vowel.
[10517.63s -> 10520.22s]  We have a vowel and one strike.
[10520.22s -> 10522.10s]  Okay, colors.
[10522.10s -> 10524.66s]  What the fuck, I thought I wasn't even clicking on the,
[10524.66s -> 10526.87s]  you have two strikes now, sir.
[10526.87s -> 10528.01s]  I didn't know I was in the module.
[10528.01s -> 10528.85s]  Two strikes.
[10528.85s -> 10531.46s]  Whatever.
[10531.46s -> 10534.00s]  Yellow.
[10534.00s -> 10539.43s]  Let's go, blue.
[10539.43s -> 10541.72s]  Yellow, blue.
[10541.72s -> 10546.32s]  Red.
[10546.32s -> 10550.47s]  Yellow, blue, red.
[10550.47s -> 10557.90s]  That will be blue, red, green.
[10557.90s -> 10561.91s]  Yellow, blue, red, red.
[10561.91s -> 10564.89s]  Yellow, blue, red, red.
[10564.89s -> 10571.32s]  Blue, red, green, green.
[10571.32s -> 10572.40s]  Okay, next one.
[10572.40s -> 10574.96s]  Now we've got a, we just got regular wires.
[10574.96s -> 10577.40s]  There are three wires.
[10577.40s -> 10578.22s]  Okay.
[10578.22s -> 10581.26s]  Two white, one yellow, that's it, three wires.
[10581.26s -> 10582.22s]  Are there no red wires?
[10582.22s -> 10583.59s]  No red wires.
[10583.59s -> 10585.09s]  Cut the second wire.
[10585.09s -> 10588.24s]  Okay, we have a white detonate button.
[10588.24s -> 10589.36s]  Okay, hang on, hang on.
[10589.36s -> 10593.54s]  There are more, there are two batteries.
[10593.54s -> 10594.98s]  Press and immediately release the bomb.
[10594.98s -> 10595.82s]  Press and immediately release.
[10595.82s -> 10598.26s]  Okay, we have Pac-Man.
[10598.26s -> 10603.00s]  Pac-Man, the circles, by the way, are A2 and F3.
[10603.00s -> 10609.04s]  And then we start in A2, and we are going to B5.
[10609.04s -> 10614.66s]  Okay, go up, right, right.
[10614.66s -> 10616.12s]  Yep.
[10616.12s -> 10617.57s]  Down.
[10617.57s -> 10620.31s]  Yep.
[10620.31s -> 10621.15s]  Left, down.
[10621.15s -> 10622.60s]  Yep.
[10622.60s -> 10624.38s]  Right.
[10624.38s -> 10625.22s]  Yep.
[10625.22s -> 10626.73s]  Down.
[10626.73s -> 10629.92s]  Yep.
[10629.92s -> 10630.76s]  Right.
[10630.76s -> 10631.58s]  Oh shit, I'm sorry.
[10631.58s -> 10633.17s]  Left, up, left.
[10633.17s -> 10635.58s]  Left, up.
[10635.58s -> 10636.40s]  Left, up, left.
[10636.40s -> 10638.57s]  Yep.
[10638.57s -> 10639.41s]  Up, right.
[10641.48s -> 10642.32s]  Up.
[10642.32s -> 10643.58s]  Up.
[10643.58s -> 10644.42s]  Left, left, left.
[10644.42s -> 10645.26s]  Left, left, left.
[10645.26s -> 10647.36s]  All the way to the bottom.
[10647.36s -> 10648.20s]  Okay, we got up.
[10648.20s -> 10652.97s]  Oh.
[10652.97s -> 10654.29s]  How many models do we have left?
[10654.29s -> 10656.05s]  One after that, and it was the symbols.
[10656.05s -> 10656.89s]  Oh, fuck.
[10656.89s -> 10659.21s]  Oh, I was supposed to go guess.
[10659.21s -> 10660.29s]  It could have been good.
[10660.29s -> 10661.13s]  Oh, that was close.
[10661.13s -> 10661.97s]  That was so close.
[10661.97s -> 10663.29s]  I got confused there for a second.
[10663.29s -> 10665.85s]  No, I fucking, no, it was because when I clicked,
[10665.85s -> 10667.33s]  I thought I wasn't clicked in a module,
[10667.33s -> 10669.48s]  and I made it speed up faster.
[10669.48s -> 10671.44s]  I was like trying to click into the module,
[10671.44s -> 10673.96s]  and I thought I was already in there.
[10673.96s -> 10675.44s]  All right, let's go, let's go, we got it.
[10675.64s -> 10679.16s]  That was, you know, possibilities are there, you know.
[10679.16s -> 10681.40s]  We're good, we almost had it, first try.
[10681.40s -> 10684.48s]  Too bad you're not coming to make it.
[10684.48s -> 10688.48s]  Okay, we got a word, just a jumbler thing.
[10688.48s -> 10690.00s]  Okay, first one, what do we have?
[10690.00s -> 10695.91s]  B-R-G-C-I-E.
[10695.91s -> 10697.39s]  B-R-J-C.
[10697.39s -> 10701.12s]  B-R-G-C-I-E.
[10701.12s -> 10704.85s]  C-I-G.
[10704.85s -> 10705.69s]  Okay, second ones.
[10705.69s -> 10707.93s]  Yeah, B-R-G-C-I-E.
[10707.93s -> 10712.93s]  Second one is V-U-P-K-M-I-V.
[10716.65s -> 10723.92s]  Let's see, I got it, that's right.
[10723.92s -> 10728.42s]  Okay, Pac-Man, Pac-Man.
[10728.42s -> 10730.06s]  Okay, we got Pac-Man, Pac-Man, let's all fuck this up.
[10730.06s -> 10731.44s]  Okay, so what do we got?

[11334.04s -> 11335.04s]  Cut the fourth wire.
[11336.51s -> 11337.35s]  Done.
[11337.35s -> 11339.51s]  Okay, now we've got a complicated one.
[11339.51s -> 11342.23s]  It's the sidewards horizontal complex wires one.
[11342.23s -> 11343.67s]  Okay, let's kick some ass at this one.
[11343.67s -> 11344.51s]  Let's kick some ass.
[11344.51s -> 11345.43s]  Here we go.
[11345.43s -> 11348.55s]  All right, so red, red, first one is going to.
[11348.55s -> 11351.77s]  Red, red is the first wire, it's going to C.
[11351.77s -> 11352.83s]  Cut it.
[11352.83s -> 11354.43s]  Blue is the second wire, it's going to B.
[11354.43s -> 11356.79s]  It's in the third slot, so three to B.
[11357.47s -> 11358.31s]  Cut it.
[11358.31s -> 11359.15s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[11359.15s -> 11360.83s]  I just, I did, I cut it.
[11360.83s -> 11362.40s]  Okay, sorry.
[11362.40s -> 11363.24s]  Good, go.
[11363.24s -> 11364.08s]  Next one, next one, next one.
[11364.08s -> 11364.92s]  Okay, next one.
[11364.92s -> 11367.56s]  We have our second red wire and second blue wire
[11367.56s -> 11368.88s]  but our first black wire here.
[11368.88s -> 11371.60s]  So the first red wire is going to C.
[11371.60s -> 11372.66s]  Cut the black wire.
[11372.66s -> 11373.76s]  Cut the black wire, okay.
[11373.76s -> 11376.32s]  The blue one, the blue one is the second one, right?
[11376.32s -> 11377.60s]  Or the first one, first one, right?
[11377.60s -> 11380.68s]  The blue one is the second wire.
[11380.68s -> 11381.96s]  No, no, no, the blue one.
[11381.96s -> 11383.88s]  The blue one is the third wire, I believe,
[11383.88s -> 11385.52s]  of this sequence here.
[11385.52s -> 11387.56s]  Okay, is it the first occurrence we see in blue?
[11387.56s -> 11388.38s]  It's the first blue we see.
[11388.38s -> 11390.06s]  No, this is the second time we've seen a blue wire.
[11390.06s -> 11390.90s]  It's going from five to C.
[11390.90s -> 11391.72s]  Is it going to C?
[11391.72s -> 11392.56s]  Yes, it is.
[11392.56s -> 11393.38s]  Is it going to C?
[11393.38s -> 11394.22s]  Cut it.
[11394.22s -> 11395.50s]  Yes.
[11395.50s -> 11396.42s]  Yes.
[11396.42s -> 11397.62s]  Keep going?
[11397.62s -> 11398.50s]  Yes.
[11398.50s -> 11403.44s]  Okay, here we have our third blue wire and two black wires.
[11403.44s -> 11406.64s]  Is it going to B or A?
[11406.64s -> 11408.96s]  It's going to C, the blue wire is going to C.
[11408.96s -> 11409.80s]  Third time we see.
[11409.80s -> 11411.12s]  Ignore that, ignore that one, ignore that one.
[11411.12s -> 11413.56s]  Two black wires, one going to B, one going to C.
[11414.40s -> 11416.04s]  And this will be the second black wire, right?
[11416.04s -> 11418.68s]  This would be the, let's see.
[11418.68s -> 11421.02s]  This is the second and third black wire here.
[11422.70s -> 11423.54s]  Okay, so the first-
[11423.54s -> 11424.38s]  One's going to C, one's going to B.
[11424.38s -> 11426.87s]  The first one's going to C.
[11426.87s -> 11429.15s]  Cut the one that goes to C.
[11429.15s -> 11430.62s]  Okay.
[11430.62s -> 11434.87s]  And does the third one go to B?
[11434.87s -> 11435.71s]  Yes, it does.
[11435.71s -> 11436.55s]  Okay, cut that one too.
[11436.55s -> 11437.71s]  Okay.
[11437.71s -> 11440.71s]  Last one, we have a black wire and a blue wire.
[11440.71s -> 11442.19s]  11 to C, both going to C.
[11442.19s -> 11443.63s]  11 and 12, both going to C.
[11443.63s -> 11444.71s]  Blue wire and black wire.
[11445.39s -> 11447.67s]  Blue wire will be what in terms of occurrence?
[11447.67s -> 11452.67s]  So this would be the one, two, three, fourth blue wire.
[11454.39s -> 11455.23s]  Does it go to A?
[11455.23s -> 11456.69s]  Goes to C.
[11456.69s -> 11458.11s]  Skip it.
[11458.11s -> 11458.95s]  Nope.
[11458.95s -> 11460.83s]  Oh, cut the black wire, cut the black wire.
[11460.83s -> 11462.03s]  Done?
[11462.03s -> 11463.03s]  Yes.
[11463.03s -> 11465.91s]  Woo, we did it.
[11465.91s -> 11467.55s]  Oh, we have plenty of time, we have plenty of time.
[11467.55s -> 11468.39s]  42 seconds.
[11468.39s -> 11470.23s]  We have plenty of time?
[11470.23s -> 11471.83s]  Yeah, we have the 42 seconds.
[11471.83s -> 11473.67s]  That felt like fucking 25 minutes.
[11473.67s -> 11476.35s]  Yeah, I thought we had like 10 seconds left.
[11476.35s -> 11478.11s]  Jesus.
[11478.11s -> 11480.24s]  Oh my God.
[11480.24s -> 11481.98s]  Nice work.
[11481.98s -> 11484.11s]  That was good.
[11484.11s -> 11486.48s]  Dude, I'm fucking exhausted.
[11486.48s -> 11488.45s]  That was fucking wild.
[11488.45s -> 11489.65s]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[11489.65s -> 11492.69s]  I can't imagine how much more difficult this game gets.
[11492.69s -> 11494.25s]  Dude, I tell you one thing.
[11495.13s -> 11497.69s]  We sure got way better at this in the fucking first stream.
[11497.69s -> 11498.53s]  Yes.
[11498.53s -> 11500.44s]  My God.
[11500.44s -> 11502.60s]  Wow.
[11502.60s -> 11503.42s]  That was fucking-
[11503.42s -> 11506.56s]  Dude, I'm like, it feels like I'm running a marathon.
[11506.56s -> 11507.76s]  Like, I'm physically exhausted.
[11508.12s -> 11510.92s]  I've been sitting down, but it's been like a,
[11510.92s -> 11512.20s]  I've actually been nervous this time.
[11512.20s -> 11514.72s]  Like, holy shit, man.
[11514.72s -> 11516.12s]  Yeah, I'm like sweating.
[11516.12s -> 11517.84s]  Somebody said this would be funny.
[11517.84s -> 11518.72s]  Do you want to preview the next one?
[11518.72s -> 11519.56s]  Just to see what the fuck is ahead of us.
[11519.56s -> 11521.00s]  Yeah, what is needy?
[11522.16s -> 11524.12s]  This is like a, this is a new mechanic.
[11524.12s -> 11525.40s]  Something is different about this bomb
[11525.40s -> 11527.89s]  and it demands attention.
[11527.89s -> 11529.97s]  Plus, yeah, apparently this bomb is needy.
[11531.96s -> 11533.12s]  Somebody said we should hook ourselves
[11533.12s -> 11535.72s]  up to small electric devices that give us small shocks
[11535.72s -> 11536.80s]  if we blow it.
[11538.04s -> 11540.20s]  That would be like death penalty.
[11540.20s -> 11541.88s]  That's electrical chair, man.
[11541.88s -> 11543.40s]  That's like TOS.
[11543.40s -> 11544.84s]  You ever seen the green mile?
[11546.70s -> 11548.54s]  Yes, I have.
[11548.54s -> 11549.38s]  All right, what's this?
[11549.38s -> 11550.66s]  Okay, so what the fuck are we looking at?
[11550.66s -> 11553.14s]  Okay, so apparently there's a new module here
[11553.14s -> 11554.62s]  that has like a bop it.
[11554.62s -> 11557.06s]  There's like a pull it, twist it, measure it.
[11557.06s -> 11557.90s]  Okay.
[11561.50s -> 11564.54s]  It says discharge the capacitor before it overloads
[11564.54s -> 11566.96s]  by holding down the lever.
[11566.96s -> 11570.01s]  So if I hold this down, okay.
[11571.22s -> 11574.36s]  I don't know what any of this means.
[11574.36s -> 11577.88s]  I think, and the word is needy, right?
[11577.88s -> 11579.76s]  I mean, needy is just the name of the bomb.
[11579.76s -> 11581.24s]  No, it's like the type of bomb it is.
[11581.24s -> 11583.68s]  I think this means that when we were gonna do this
[11583.68s -> 11585.84s]  next string question mark, I don't fucking know.
[11585.84s -> 11588.80s]  I think this is gonna build up a danger factor
[11588.80s -> 11590.36s]  and we have to like keep on being like,
[11590.36s -> 11592.88s]  no, go down, go done, you know?
[11592.88s -> 11593.72s]  We can't.
[11595.32s -> 11598.12s]  I think we have to like discharge it or something.
[11598.12s -> 11598.96s]  Oh, okay.
[11598.96s -> 11601.08s]  Well, I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what.
[11601.08s -> 11603.44s]  I think, how long have we been streaming?
[11603.44s -> 11604.28s]  Just curious.
[11604.28s -> 11606.20s]  Like three hours, 15 minutes.
[11606.20s -> 11608.24s]  I am fine with that.
[11608.24s -> 11610.32s]  I think we can call it here.
[11610.32s -> 11611.48s]  Okay.
[11611.48s -> 11613.52s]  Any more than this and I would have been like,
[11613.52s -> 11616.28s]  dude, just blow it up, we're fucked.
[11616.28s -> 11618.12s]  But here's-
[11618.12s -> 11620.60s]  Oh, is this not, oh, actually that's how.
[11620.60s -> 11622.36s]  Let me see what you're doing on screen, hang on.
[11622.36s -> 11623.20s]  Okay, you ready?
[11623.20s -> 11624.68s]  Can you imagine doing this?
[11626.06s -> 11627.90s]  Start, press start, press start.
[11627.90s -> 11630.89s]  Oh, would you, is this even possible?
[11630.89s -> 11631.73s]  Let's find out.
[11637.40s -> 11642.46s]  All right, let's go.
[11642.46s -> 11645.02s]  Quick, three, five, nine, five.
[11645.02s -> 11647.56s]  Three, five, nine, five on the Morse.
[11647.56s -> 11648.40s]  The word is,
[11648.40s -> 11652.68s]  th, th,
[11652.68s -> 11654.12s]  see,
[11654.12s -> 11655.98s]  sex.
[11655.98s -> 11656.82s]  Sex.
[11656.82s -> 11657.90s]  No, no, no, back, back, back, back.
[11657.90s -> 11661.24s]  It's sex.
[11661.24s -> 11663.96s]  No, no, no, sex.
[11663.96s -> 11665.16s]  Sex queue.
[11665.16s -> 11670.72s]  Sex queue.
[11670.72s -> 11672.41s]  Winsage.
[11672.41s -> 11674.41s]  Sorry, I lost you there.
[11674.41s -> 11675.25s]  Thicc.
[11678.53s -> 11679.37s]  Let's try that,
[11679.49s -> 11680.89s]  insane mode one more time.
[11682.56s -> 11685.04s]  Wait, we can't, we can't do that.
[11685.04s -> 11687.40s]  I know, but let's see if we can solve one
[11687.40s -> 11688.24s]  completely randomly.
[11688.24s -> 11689.32s]  Do you want to just try to solve one?
[11689.32s -> 11690.16s]  All right, let's try to solve.
[11690.16s -> 11692.16s]  If we solve one, then I'll eat for,
[11693.24s -> 11694.08s]  I'll eat something.
[11694.08s -> 11694.92s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[11694.92s -> 11696.92s]  Listen, we have enough Salmonella for a lifetime.
[11696.92s -> 11697.76s]  All right, here we go.
[11697.76s -> 11703.18s]  Ready?
[11703.18s -> 11704.26s]  Okay, symbols.
[11704.26s -> 11705.10s]  Just look at the very first symbol.
[11705.10s -> 11705.92s]  Omega.
[11705.92s -> 11706.76s]  Oh shit.
[11706.76s -> 11707.60s]  Omega.
[11707.60s -> 11708.42s]  Okay, hang on.
[11708.42s -> 11709.26s]  Omega.
[11709.82s -> 11710.66s]  Hang on.
[11710.66s -> 11712.12s]  Omega.
[11712.12s -> 11712.96s]  Trident.
[11712.96s -> 11713.80s]  AE.
[11713.80s -> 11717.77s]  And then Microsoft staple mascot.
[11717.77s -> 11719.21s]  Okay, you want to go,
[11719.21s -> 11723.75s]  you want to go staple mascot.
[11723.75s -> 11725.21s]  Yep.
[11725.21s -> 11726.03s]  AE.
[11726.03s -> 11727.37s]  Yep.
[11727.37s -> 11728.64s]  Trident.
[11728.64s -> 11729.48s]  Omega.
[11729.48s -> 11730.30s]  Got it, got it.
[11730.30s -> 11731.32s]  Okay.
[11731.32s -> 11732.64s]  All right, we solved one.
[11732.64s -> 11733.48s]  I was just trying to guess.
[11733.48s -> 11740.13s]  We got it.
[11740.13s -> 11741.17s]  Holy shit.
[11741.17s -> 11742.01s]  How would anybody,
[11742.01s -> 11743.29s]  there are probably speed runners that can do this shit
[11743.29s -> 11744.93s]  in five, 10 seconds.
[11744.93s -> 11746.49s]  Dude, imagine getting so fucking good at this.
[11746.49s -> 11748.13s]  You don't even depend on somebody.
[11748.13s -> 11749.65s]  You just remember from just like,
[11749.65s -> 11750.49s]  You just do it.
[11750.49s -> 11753.77s]  Algorithmic, like, you know.
[11753.77s -> 11755.17s]  Somebody, oh, by the way,
[11755.17s -> 11756.01s]  I forgot about this.
[11756.01s -> 11757.59s]  Somebody emailed me,
[11757.59s -> 11761.76s]  there is a mod for this game called Speed.
[11761.76s -> 11762.60s]  Speed?
[11762.60s -> 11763.92s]  It's a multiplayer mod.
[11763.92s -> 11766.16s]  You've seen the movie Speed?
[11766.16s -> 11767.62s]  Uh-huh.
[11767.62s -> 11769.30s]  Somebody modded in that someone,
[11769.30s -> 11772.66s]  you have to drive the bus with A and D
[11772.66s -> 11775.50s]  and always go around 80 miles per hour
[11775.50s -> 11776.34s]  or else it explodes.
[11776.34s -> 11777.38s]  Why didn't we do this?
[11777.38s -> 11778.62s]  Why didn't we do this one?
[11778.62s -> 11781.51s]  This looks awesome.
[11781.51s -> 11782.35s]  I'll tell you what.
[11782.35s -> 11783.57s]  I'll tell you what.
[11783.57s -> 11784.41s]  Next one.
[11784.41s -> 11785.25s]  Next time.
[11785.25s -> 11786.91s]  Next one.
[11786.91s -> 11788.71s]  And I'll tell you what.
[11788.71s -> 11790.35s]  Let's get a bunch of mods next time.
[11790.35s -> 11791.99s]  Let's download a, you know.
[11791.99s -> 11792.83s]  You want to fuck it up the whole,
[11792.83s -> 11793.67s]  you want to fuck the whole thing up?
[11793.67s -> 11796.14s]  A bunch of crap.
[11796.14s -> 11798.10s]  Well, I'll tell you what, man.
[11798.10s -> 11799.22s]  This was a lot of fun.
[11799.22s -> 11800.94s]  And I think the stream went way better
[11800.94s -> 11802.38s]  now that we're like sitting down
[11802.38s -> 11804.78s]  and we're like, let's be very serious.
[11805.86s -> 11807.12s]  But this was a lot of fun, man.
[11807.12s -> 11808.54s]  This was a very fun stream
[11808.54s -> 11811.02s]  and I can breathe now,
[11811.02s -> 11812.54s]  but a lot of fun, man.
[11812.54s -> 11813.38s]  A lot of fun.
[11814.64s -> 11815.48s]  Yeah.
[11815.48s -> 11816.92s]  Well, we'll probably see you again soon.
[11816.92s -> 11819.04s]  Thanks for hanging out, Joel.
[11819.04s -> 11821.72s]  We're squad stream so people can just look to the right
[11821.72s -> 11824.00s]  and see your channel, so.
[11824.00s -> 11824.92s]  Absolutely.
[11824.92s -> 11826.48s]  Always give Joel a follow.
[11826.48s -> 11830.02s]  He's a fucking great dude.
[11830.02s -> 11831.74s]  And we'll see you again.
[11831.74s -> 11832.58s]  Whenever.
[11832.58s -> 11833.42s]  Yeah, absolutely.
[11833.42s -> 11835.42s]  Whenever you want to do this again.
[11835.42s -> 11838.38s]  Hit me up and I'll wake up at 3 a.m.
[11838.38s -> 11842.50s]  and have sand in my ass and be like,
[11842.50s -> 11843.34s]  knocking over cans.
[11843.34s -> 11845.78s]  Like, I got a diffuse mumps.
[11847.22s -> 11848.54s]  You got cans in your room too?
[11848.54s -> 11849.58s]  Wow.
[11849.58s -> 11851.10s]  Look at how similar we are, guys.
[11851.10s -> 11852.38s]  Look at us.
[11852.38s -> 11853.50s]  But what are you saying?
[11853.50s -> 11855.06s]  What are you guys saying?
[11855.06s -> 11856.82s]  Except one of us is funny.
[11856.82s -> 11858.70s]  But that's not me, by the way.
[11858.70s -> 11860.10s]  But which one?
[11860.10s -> 11861.10s]  No, you are.
[11861.10s -> 11861.94s]  Okay, listen.
[11863.02s -> 11864.70s]  No.
[11864.70s -> 11866.70s]  Anyway, my point being,
[11866.70s -> 11867.94s]  my point being,
[11870.30s -> 11871.34s]  I had a blast
[11871.34s -> 11874.66s]  and now that we know how all these modules work.
[11874.66s -> 11875.50s]  Now we can drive a car.
[11875.50s -> 11880.10s]  And yeah, the only thing we have to be a little better at
[11880.10s -> 11881.38s]  is we have to,
[11883.65s -> 11885.81s]  I have, well, you don't need any practice
[11885.81s -> 11888.01s]  on the password module, but I'll say this.
[11888.01s -> 11890.49s]  The memory shit is really difficult.
[11890.49s -> 11893.02s]  And I suggest maybe next stream,
[11893.02s -> 11896.94s]  get like a note thing or something to just be like,
[11896.94s -> 11897.98s]  yeah, that's not cheating.
[11897.98s -> 11901.46s]  Cause it's, you know, fucking,
[11901.46s -> 11903.26s]  when I do math in real life, I'm like, I had to write shit.
[11903.26s -> 11904.74s]  You know what, I'm going to get the thing.
[11904.74s -> 11907.46s]  I have this thing where I can draw on my screen.
[11907.46s -> 11908.30s]  I'm just going to get that.
[11908.30s -> 11909.14s]  Me too.
[11909.14s -> 11909.98s]  Me too.
[11909.98s -> 11910.82s]  Hang on, hang on.
[11910.82s -> 11911.66s]  Check this bad boy out.
[11911.66s -> 11913.30s]  Hang on.
[11913.30s -> 11914.22s]  You got one?
[11914.22s -> 11916.38s]  Yeah, they're pretty, they're awesome.
[11916.38s -> 11922.12s]  I've used them before.
[11922.12s -> 11923.12s]  A pencil.
[11923.12s -> 11923.96s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[11923.96s -> 11925.72s]  Like the pen that you can just draw on the screen.
[11925.72s -> 11930.25s]  So I can be like, okay, one and then two, three, four.
[11930.25s -> 11933.93s]  You should race desert bus with Joel.
[11933.93s -> 11938.26s]  Oh, that's, how do you race desert bus?
[11938.26s -> 11950.48s]  When you just go the same speed on the same road.
[11950.48s -> 11957.50s]  It's a race.
[11957.50s -> 11959.40s]  It's like my stream, man.
[11959.40s -> 11960.24s]  Oh, let me see.
[11960.24s -> 11963.18s]  Let me see what you're doing.
[11963.18s -> 11964.02s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[11964.02s -> 11965.78s]  You can draw kind of well.
[11965.78s -> 11968.44s]  You know how to draw.
[11968.44s -> 11971.11s]  It's a photo, dude.
[11971.11s -> 11977.88s]  You didn't just draw that?
[11977.88s -> 11979.52s]  I'll see you next week.
[11979.52s -> 11983.12s]  Hopefully whenever we, whenever we,
[11983.12s -> 11984.96s]  whenever we cross paths again,
[11984.96s -> 11988.20s]  but once again, thank you for having me on the stream.
[11988.20s -> 11993.56s]  I hope, I hope that, or us playing this a little bit better
[11993.80s -> 11996.88s]  add a little more quality to the stream, but you know.
[11996.88s -> 11998.72s]  Hey, the last one was quality too.
[11999.56s -> 12000.40s]  We were learning.
[12000.40s -> 12003.52s]  The last one was quality, but with 15 quotation marks.
[12003.52s -> 12006.00s]  But now we're in a little different league, I think.
[12006.00s -> 12007.88s]  But regardless, thank you so much for having me, man.
[12007.88s -> 12010.88s]  And you know, I hope next time we can,
[12010.88s -> 12013.12s]  we can breeze through it even more in an accelerated pace.
[12013.12s -> 12014.04s]  So.
[12014.04s -> 12014.88s]  That was a lot of fun.
[12014.88s -> 12015.72s]  Absolutely.
[12015.72s -> 12016.56s]  Yeah, absolutely.
[12016.56s -> 12017.40s]  We'll see you later, dude.
[12018.36s -> 12019.20s]  See you later and.
[12019.20s -> 12020.04s]  Have a good sleep.
[12020.04s -> 12023.13s]  Well, actually, you know, you just woke up, didn't you?
[12023.13s -> 12025.57s]  Yeah, but you know, I'll probably eat two raw eggs later on
[12025.57s -> 12027.69s]  and I'll fucking have salmonella on my clock out for a week.
[12027.69s -> 12030.45s]  But anyway, yeah, speaking about that,
[12031.85s -> 12034.73s]  you, listen, that's not my prerogative anymore.
[12034.73s -> 12036.21s]  You check out whenever you are gonna go
[12036.21s -> 12038.49s]  on a heart attack grill and eat onion rings
[12038.49s -> 12039.65s]  that will give you like.
[12040.65s -> 12041.77s]  I'm looking forward to it.
[12041.77s -> 12043.65s]  Biblical, biblical diarrhea.
[12043.65s -> 12045.29s]  So, you know.
[12045.29s -> 12046.89s]  I don't know, I, yeah, probably.
[12048.57s -> 12050.65s]  But regardless, thank you for having me, man.
[12050.65s -> 12052.13s]  And.
[12052.13s -> 12052.97s]  You as well.
[12052.97s -> 12053.89s]  Thanks for having me too.
[12053.89s -> 12056.21s]  Thanks for you having me, having you having me.
[12056.21s -> 12057.05s]  Right?
[12057.05s -> 12057.89s]  Yeah, absolutely.
[12057.89s -> 12058.73s]  Thank you, Jerma.
[12058.73s -> 12063.29s]  And thank you, Jerma Chat for calling me a turnip.
[12063.29s -> 12064.13s]  I'll see you.
[12065.71s -> 12070.12s]  All right, get deleted.
[12070.12s -> 12071.16s]  Yeah, get deleted.
[12072.99s -> 12073.83s]  See ya.
[12075.27s -> 12078.58s]  All right.
[12078.58s -> 12080.06s]  All right, guys.
[12080.06s -> 12083.75s]  What we're gonna do is
[12083.83s -> 12088.24s]  I, I am going to be,
[12088.24s -> 12091.04s]  I just was talking to Kim.
[12091.04s -> 12095.64s]  And I think we're gonna go to dinner.
[12095.64s -> 12096.48s]  We're gonna go out to dinner.
[12096.48s -> 12097.64s]  It's Diablo and you know it.
[12097.64s -> 12104.45s]  It's not.
[12104.45s -> 12109.82s]  Oh, I see how it is.
[12109.82s -> 12111.64s]  You hate us.
[12111.64s -> 12113.52s]  A three and a half hour stream.
[12113.52s -> 12115.59s]  Get it.
[12115.59s -> 12120.85s]  We're going to the heart attack grill.
[12120.85s -> 12122.73s]  No, that's probably a good place.
[12122.73s -> 12124.29s]  I don't, I don't wanna,
[12124.29s -> 12126.81s]  I don't wanna know Diablo II tonight.
[12126.81s -> 12134.74s]  No Diablo II tonight.
[12134.82s -> 12139.03s]  It's time for the water filter stream and you know it.
[12139.03s -> 12141.71s]  Now, I'm gonna give you guys kind of how the,
[12141.71s -> 12144.65s]  the way that the streams are gonna work for a while.
[12144.65s -> 12150.41s]  I have a very, very, very busy, busy February.
[12150.41s -> 12151.25s]  Real wink.
[12151.25s -> 12157.17s]  Well, all right, well fucking let's go to the wink.
[12157.17s -> 12158.77s]  So how, let me, let's go.
[12158.77s -> 12160.45s]  This actually will take like probably a few minutes
[12160.45s -> 12161.29s]  to go over.
[12161.29s -> 12164.63s]  Let's go over this.
[12164.63s -> 12165.83s]  Let's go.
[12165.83s -> 12169.49s]  I'm gonna just give you a bunch of money.
[12169.49s -> 12174.98s]  Dry Ski just gave 5,000 bits.
[12174.98s -> 12177.96s]  Thank you, Dry Ski.
[12177.96s -> 12181.60s]  50 fucking dollars.
[12181.60s -> 12182.80s]  Yeah, no, we're still gonna do the end of the stream.
[12182.80s -> 12187.21s]  We're still gonna hang out.
[12187.21s -> 12189.17s]  5,000 bits.
[12189.17s -> 12192.76s]  Let me just pull up my bit device here.
[12192.76s -> 12195.84s]  Here it is.
[12195.84s -> 12196.76s]  It's Dry Ski.
[12196.76s -> 12199.16s]  They say, hey, Jerma, it's my birthday today.
[12199.16s -> 12200.32s]  Wanna say you've made it so much better
[12200.32s -> 12201.68s]  with the laughs tonight.
[12201.68s -> 12203.28s]  Love the idea of you, buddy.
[12203.28s -> 12204.80s]  Have a great time.
[12204.80s -> 12206.75s]  Thank you, Dry Ski.
[12206.75s -> 12209.24s]  Happy birthday.
[12209.24s -> 12210.52s]  Not sure where you are in the world,
[12210.52s -> 12212.12s]  but hopefully it stays your birthday
[12212.12s -> 12213.69s]  for a little while longer.
[12213.69s -> 12217.74s]  The idea of you.
[12217.74s -> 12221.19s]  Taking ice cream was on its way, yeah.
[12221.19s -> 12222.03s]  Thank you.
[12222.03s -> 12222.87s]  Have a great birthday.
[12222.87s -> 12226.44s]  Phil's birthday, man.
[12226.44s -> 12228.04s]  Jerma induced a heart attack.
[12229.61s -> 12231.13s]  I love the idea of Jerma,
[12231.13s -> 12233.09s]  but the execution is just, you know,
[12233.09s -> 12234.61s]  it gets lacking sometimes.
[12234.61s -> 12235.45s]  It's lacking.
[12236.29s -> 12239.63s]  No, thanks a lot, man.
[12239.63s -> 12241.23s]  But let's go over.
[12241.23s -> 12242.07s]  Let's go.
[12242.07s -> 12243.59s]  Let's put the cam on for this.
[12243.59s -> 12245.55s]  Just so, cause, you know, obviously
[12245.55s -> 12247.67s]  not really playing the exploding game anymore,
[12247.67s -> 12249.39s]  but I'll just go right in the middle.
[12249.39s -> 12250.83s]  So there you go.
[12250.83s -> 12251.99s]  You guys are right here.
[12253.76s -> 12258.59s]  So over the course of the next couple of weeks,
[12258.59s -> 12260.99s]  I have some doctor's appointments
[12260.99s -> 12263.27s]  and I also have some old friends,
[12263.27s -> 12267.46s]  some hometown friends that are coming up to visit Vegas
[12267.46s -> 12269.86s]  and they're going to spend some time here.
[12269.86s -> 12273.78s]  So we're going to do a few kind of one day off,
[12273.78s -> 12277.98s]  one day on, two day, but here's, hear me out on this one.
[12277.98s -> 12281.99s]  So I will be back on Sunday.
[12281.99s -> 12284.35s]  I will be back on Sunday.
[12284.35s -> 12285.39s]  We're going to stream on Sunday.
[12285.39s -> 12286.87s]  So that's the 26th.
[12286.87s -> 12290.11s]  And then I'm going to be off on the 20th.
[12290.11s -> 12290.95s]  What just happened?
[12290.95s -> 12291.77s]  Oh, okay.
[12291.77s -> 12294.68s]  I'm going to be off on the 27th.
[12294.68s -> 12300.56s]  And then we are going to go five days in a row.
[12301.23s -> 12303.59s]  We are going to do Tuesday, Wednesday,
[12303.59s -> 12305.19s]  Thursday, Friday, Saturday.
[12305.19s -> 12307.34s]  We're doing five days in a row
[12307.34s -> 12311.73s]  because the week after that, the next week,
[12311.73s -> 12313.59s]  that first, second week of February,
[12313.59s -> 12315.67s]  I'm not going to be live for more
[12315.67s -> 12319.25s]  than probably once, twice a week.
[12320.09s -> 12322.78s]  So we are going to do five days in a row
[12322.78s -> 12323.86s]  as of this coming Tuesday.
[12323.86s -> 12328.19s]  But again, you'll see me again on Sunday,
[12328.19s -> 12330.27s]  nothing on Monday, and then five days in a row
[12330.27s -> 12332.67s]  until I take some time off.
[12332.67s -> 12335.01s]  It's not going to be Diablo.
[12335.01s -> 12336.37s]  No, we have a lot of games to play.
[12336.37s -> 12337.89s]  It's not going to be fucking Diablo.
[12337.89s -> 12340.49s]  What's wrong with my hair?
[12340.49s -> 12343.64s]  It's painted on.
[12343.64s -> 12349.83s]  I mean, it's a little bit of this, yeah.
[12349.83s -> 12351.51s]  When's community content night part two?
[12351.51s -> 12353.27s]  That's actually a really, really great question.
[12353.27s -> 12354.91s]  That's a great question.
[12354.91s -> 12360.56s]  That's going to happen on probably Sunday
[12360.56s -> 12362.28s]  because that's when I said I was going to have
[12362.28s -> 12363.84s]  this coming weekend, right?
[12363.84s -> 12365.16s]  So we'll do that on Sunday.
[12365.16s -> 12367.52s]  That'll be part two of community content night.
[12369.42s -> 12370.46s]  That will be a quick one.
[12370.46s -> 12372.34s]  So we'll do something else.
[12372.34s -> 12373.70s]  We'll do community content night
[12373.70s -> 12377.55s]  and then we'll bleed into something else.
[12377.55s -> 12379.51s]  But that's the schedule for the next couple of weeks
[12379.51s -> 12381.11s]  because I'm taking a lot of time off
[12381.11s -> 12382.51s]  that first week of February.
[12383.82s -> 12384.94s]  Don't point at me.
[12384.94s -> 12387.50s]  I told you I'm like a fucking,
[12387.50s -> 12389.42s]  I like cast spells when I talk.
[12393.38s -> 12394.86s]  That's it for tonight.
[12394.86s -> 12398.53s]  See you guys in a couple of days on Sunday.
[12398.53s -> 12400.60s]  And that's it.
[12400.60s -> 12401.68s]  Shorter stream tonight, I know,
[12401.68s -> 12403.76s]  but my brain is a little,
[12403.76s -> 12407.84s]  I mean, he was right when he said that after doing that,
[12407.84s -> 12409.84s]  it's almost like I need to go eat
[12409.84s -> 12411.48s]  and just relax for a while.
[12413.09s -> 12414.05s]  Signing off.
[12414.05s -> 12416.80s]  I'll see you guys on Sunday.
[12416.80s -> 12418.08s]  But let's do the end of the stream.
[12418.08s -> 12420.24s]  Let's hang out for a little bit, as always.
[12420.24s -> 12423.88s]  I'm not just going to leave.
[12423.88s -> 12424.88s]  When's the rumble?
[12424.88s -> 12427.76s]  Yes, there's going to be a charity rumble.
[12427.80s -> 12429.00s]  I haven't talked that much about it,
[12429.00s -> 12431.68s]  but I've talked enough about it for you guys to know.
[12431.68s -> 12437.56s]  The next rumble is going to be a charity rumble.
[12437.56s -> 12441.40s]  It's going to be to sponsor one of my closest friends,
[12441.40s -> 12444.21s]  Boston Marathon Run.
[12444.21s -> 12445.73s]  All the money that comes in during that stream,
[12445.73s -> 12449.17s]  there's going to be a special link to donate
[12449.17s -> 12455.76s]  to raise the money to sponsor his run.
[12455.76s -> 12456.60s]  That should be really fun.
[12456.60s -> 12459.18s]  And that's probably going to happen
[12459.18s -> 12463.99s]  somewhere in February into March.
[12463.99s -> 12467.00s]  That's when it's planned, at least.
[12467.00s -> 12472.28s]  Because obviously the marathon is in April,
[12472.28s -> 12474.44s]  so we kind of have to do it before then,
[12474.44s -> 12477.80s]  because obviously he needs to be sponsored before then.
[12477.80s -> 12485.95s]  Yo Joel, why you eating chips?
[12485.95s -> 12489.12s]  Why though?
[12489.12s -> 12491.16s]  Why what?
[12491.16s -> 12496.33s]  Why do a charity stream?
[12496.33s -> 12500.46s]  I don't know, I don't follow you.
[12500.46s -> 12501.98s]  But why though?
[12501.98s -> 12509.50s]  Hey, but why though?
[12509.50s -> 12512.01s]  But yeah, now that's the plan.
[12512.01s -> 12514.57s]  Let's rewind the clock a little bit.
[12514.57s -> 12518.70s]  Let's do the bits.
[12518.70s -> 12521.42s]  Thank you to E-WordTorteyWordTort for the 250.
[12521.50s -> 12523.54s]  It's been a while since I've said that name out loud,
[12523.54s -> 12525.42s]  one of my favorite names.
[12525.42s -> 12527.90s]  I love saying it, E-WordTorteyWordTort.
[12527.90s -> 12532.49s]  It's 250.
[12532.49s -> 12534.61s]  We had 10 community subs from SuperBruce.
[12534.61s -> 12542.27s]  I caught it, but again, thank you, Bruce.
[12542.27s -> 12543.39s]  Much love to you.
[12543.39s -> 12547.61s]  Again, E-WordTorteyWordTort gave 250 bits.
[12547.61s -> 12549.93s]  Remember, please play Halo M when it comes out on PC,
[12549.93s -> 12552.37s]  or I'll fly to America and sign a petition to ban you.
[12552.37s -> 12561.60s]  Why do you have to fly to America to ban me?
[12561.60s -> 12562.84s]  There's a clip here.
[12562.84s -> 12565.20s]  I know what this clip says, but I did it.
[12565.20s -> 12566.88s]  And it...
[12566.88s -> 12568.88s]  E-WordTorteyWordTort, thanks for the $5.
[12568.88s -> 12572.88s]  Jerma, play Halo on PC, please, thank you.
[12572.88s -> 12574.40s]  Probably.
[12574.40s -> 12575.72s]  I did.
[12575.72s -> 12577.20s]  I don't see why not, probably.
[12577.20s -> 12578.48s]  I did.
[12578.48s -> 12581.05s]  Not the next day, probably not.
[12581.05s -> 12583.43s]  On legendary mode.
[12583.43s -> 12584.27s]  I did that too.
[12584.27s -> 12585.45s]  Delete that.
[12585.45s -> 12586.81s]  Demons V, thanks for the...
[12586.81s -> 12594.27s]  I did that too.
[12594.27s -> 12596.59s]  You call what you did playing.
[12596.59s -> 12601.59s]  Yes, I had, I controlled the character and moved around.
[12607.11s -> 12608.11s]  Fucking Halo.
[12608.11s -> 12610.11s]  That's so funny to me.
[12610.11s -> 12613.97s]  It's all good though, whatever.
[12613.97s -> 12617.13s]  All right, he's gonna ban you in real life.
[12617.13s -> 12620.28s]  You know, how do you get banned in real life?
[12620.28s -> 12624.45s]  Thank you, E-WordTorteyWordTort, appreciate it.
[12624.45s -> 12628.68s]  Oh my God, how did I miss $100 from Freddy Dredd?
[12628.68s -> 12629.52s]  How did I miss this?
[12629.52s -> 12632.71s]  This is like the most important message ever.
[12632.71s -> 12634.71s]  Freddy Dredd gave 10,000 bits earlier,
[12634.71s -> 12636.91s]  and they said, I'm at Hash House right now.
[12636.91s -> 12638.11s]  I'm gonna order.
[12638.11s -> 12640.52s]  That was like three hours ago.
[12640.52s -> 12641.36s]  God damn it.
[12647.35s -> 12652.10s]  I need to know, I have to know.
[12652.14s -> 12654.46s]  You got the blue cheeseburger?
[12654.46s -> 12657.56s]  He's waiting for you.
[12657.56s -> 12660.32s]  He's been waiting for you for three hours.
[12660.32s -> 12664.82s]  You were supposed to go to dinner.
[12664.82s -> 12666.14s]  That's the most important because of the money?
[12666.14s -> 12669.11s]  No, it's the most important because
[12669.11s -> 12671.68s]  they went to Hash House or GoGo at the link.
[12671.68s -> 12676.11s]  That's why.
[12676.11s -> 12681.96s]  Literally there, they kicked him out.
[12681.96s -> 12682.80s]  Freddy, if you're still here
[12682.80s -> 12683.76s]  or if you check back in again,
[12683.76s -> 12688.04s]  thanks so much for the fucking $1,100, $1,200 now.
[12688.04s -> 12689.83s]  Over two days.
[12689.83s -> 12691.19s]  Hope you liked it.
[12691.19s -> 12696.00s]  It's one of my favorite places.
[12696.00s -> 12697.20s]  He wouldn't notice, Freddy,
[12697.20s -> 12705.36s]  if he just typed in chat normally.
[12705.36s -> 12706.20s]  But thanks, Freddy.
[12706.20s -> 12708.58s]  Thank you so much.
[12708.58s -> 12710.22s]  Seriously, I hope you liked it.
[12710.22s -> 12711.06s]  I'm gonna, I'm so sad.
[12711.06s -> 12711.90s]  I'm kind of nervous.
[12711.90s -> 12713.46s]  What if he comes back and he's like,
[12713.46s -> 12717.39s]  dude, that was like a six out of 10 at best.
[12717.39s -> 12721.98s]  In fact, like two of my friends are sick.
[12721.98s -> 12725.40s]  I'm gonna be like, oh shit.
[12725.40s -> 12726.64s]  No, impossible.
[12726.64s -> 12729.32s]  Not possible if you go to Hash House or GoGo at the link.
[12729.32s -> 12732.04s]  Not possible.
[12732.04s -> 12738.59s]  It's just a fact, but thanks a lot.
[12738.59s -> 12739.43s]  Thank you.
[12739.43s -> 12741.59s]  I'd ever agree.
[12741.59s -> 12744.41s]  I'd ever agree.
[12744.41s -> 12746.01s]  Thanks to Five Dolls.
[12746.01s -> 12747.05s]  Jerma, so me and my friends
[12747.05s -> 12749.09s]  were doing a hunger game simulator.
[12749.09s -> 12750.29s]  We added you in as a joke,
[12750.29s -> 12752.05s]  but unfortunately you ended up killing everyone
[12752.05s -> 12759.59s]  and you won the hunger games.
[12759.59s -> 12774.11s]  Is this my, the winner is Jerma from District 10.
[12774.11s -> 12778.55s]  People add me as a joke to things and I just win.
[12778.55s -> 12781.95s]  Is the image, apparently.
[12781.95s -> 12783.43s]  Well, Adam is a joke.
[12783.43s -> 12785.57s]  Well, you know, now you guys know,
[12785.57s -> 12790.60s]  I take shit dead seriously.
[12790.60s -> 12791.80s]  I'm not, I don't fuck around.
[12791.80s -> 12792.80s]  You add me to something like that.
[12792.80s -> 12798.10s]  I'm gonna go for it.
[12798.10s -> 12805.65s]  I'm saying.
[12805.65s -> 12809.81s]  I can't just be jokey, add it in
[12809.81s -> 12811.25s]  and not win the whole thing.
[12812.81s -> 12813.97s]  But thanks.
[12813.97s -> 12817.86s]  I'm honored to have won.
[12817.86s -> 12818.94s]  Hey, Noodle is bad at gaming.
[12818.94s -> 12819.90s]  Thanks to the five for the bits.
[12819.90s -> 12821.62s]  Hey, Jerma, I made a funny video.
[12826.55s -> 12830.53s]  Why is there, oh, sorry.
[12830.53s -> 12831.97s]  Someone's talking.
[12831.97s -> 12833.73s]  That was like a poker tournament going on
[12833.73s -> 12834.97s]  on the front page of Twitch repair.
[12835.65s -> 12836.49s]  I don't know.
[12836.49s -> 12837.81s]  I just like, I hit the back button
[12837.81s -> 12839.97s]  and I'm on my Twitch homepage.
[12839.97s -> 12842.28s]  Sorry about that.
[12842.28s -> 12845.16s]  That's not the funny video, I guess.
[12845.16s -> 12849.86s]  There's another one.
[12849.86s -> 12853.04s]  It says here comes another bad Jerma video.
[12853.04s -> 12855.08s]  Last one is to see.
[12855.08s -> 12856.48s]  Black wire in the middle to see.
[12856.48s -> 12859.15s]  What number, what number?
[12859.15s -> 12860.35s]  Which time was left?
[12860.35s -> 12861.79s]  You don't wanna know.
[12872.22s -> 12873.42s]  That's a halo spoiler.
[12884.16s -> 12886.36s]  Okay, this is, I'm gonna,
[12886.36s -> 12887.76s]  here comes a halo spoiler.
[12888.76s -> 12890.20s]  Those of you that have ever seen halo,
[12890.20s -> 12891.24s]  here comes a spoiler.
[12899.39s -> 12901.47s]  Last one is to see.
[12901.47s -> 12902.87s]  Black wire in the middle to see.
[12902.87s -> 12905.35s]  What number, what number?
[12905.35s -> 12906.71s]  How much time was left?
[12906.71s -> 12918.81s]  You don't wanna know.
[12918.81s -> 12920.69s]  That's the first level in Halo 2.
[12920.69s -> 12922.05s]  I've never seen Halo 2
[12922.05s -> 12923.57s]  before you spoiled the whole game.
[12923.57s -> 12925.57s]  I can't even play it now.
[12925.57s -> 12927.69s]  Autumn Dragons, thanks for the 250
[12927.69s -> 12932.97s]  and they say, this is Morse code.
[12932.97s -> 12933.81s]  Let me just like put this
[12933.81s -> 12937.42s]  into like a Morse code translator.
[12937.46s -> 12938.26s]  Make sure this is not something
[12938.26s -> 12949.30s]  that I was gonna say something fucked up.
[12949.30s -> 12954.70s]  Okay, this is what they wrote.
[12954.70s -> 12955.82s]  I can't even write this.
[12955.82s -> 12963.53s]  Why?
[12963.53s -> 12966.89s]  So that's Morse code for Jerma sucks.
[12970.10s -> 12976.62s]  Cool, thanks.
[12976.62s -> 12977.46s]  Hey, appreciate that.
[12977.46s -> 12981.30s]  Hey, Meaty Patty, thanks for the 500 bits.
[12981.30s -> 12985.04s]  Thanks a lot.
[12985.04s -> 12989.39s]  Agent Dark Booty, thanks for the 500 bits.
[12989.39s -> 12991.47s]  Jerma, I've only been watching you since 2017
[12991.47s -> 12993.15s]  but you're giving me more wheezy laughs
[12993.15s -> 12996.58s]  than any other E-clown.
[12996.58s -> 12999.19s]  Thanks.
[12999.19s -> 13000.59s]  They say, I hope you don't take chat
[13000.59s -> 13001.47s]  ribbing you seriously.
[13001.47s -> 13004.17s]  We all love you and it's all in good fun.
[13004.17s -> 13005.69s]  Yeah, I hope you don't take some of the things
[13005.69s -> 13007.66s]  that I say seriously either.
[13007.66s -> 13008.66s]  I'm not talking about putting a hamburger
[13008.66s -> 13010.12s]  down my underwear.
[13010.12s -> 13010.96s]  You know what I mean?
[13010.96s -> 13011.80s]  That's not real.
[13011.80s -> 13013.32s]  We both say things, we're just kidding around.
[13013.32s -> 13015.04s]  Also, I have ADHD and have trouble
[13015.04s -> 13016.12s]  with motivation sometimes.
[13016.12s -> 13016.96s]  Do you experience this
[13016.96s -> 13018.80s]  or have you had any tips regarding it?
[13018.80s -> 13019.72s]  Keep it up, dude.
[13022.19s -> 13025.46s]  Yeah, all the time.
[13025.46s -> 13027.58s]  The thing that helps for me the most
[13027.58s -> 13031.46s]  is trying just to focus on one thing at a time
[13031.58s -> 13033.46s]  because I can get so spread out
[13033.46s -> 13034.78s]  and have so many things that I care about
[13034.78s -> 13039.78s]  that I care about, I have 100% of my brain that cares
[13039.98s -> 13042.26s]  and if there's 10 things that I wanna do,
[13042.26s -> 13045.46s]  each one of those things will get 10% of my brain
[13045.46s -> 13046.82s]  which just, that sucks.
[13046.82s -> 13048.50s]  It fucks everything up.
[13048.50s -> 13054.40s]  You gotta do one thing at a time, 100% of your brain power.
[13054.40s -> 13056.96s]  It's easy to be like, well, this, that, that, that, that
[13056.96s -> 13058.32s]  and then you spread yourself out so much
[13058.32s -> 13061.25s]  that you're all over the place.
[13061.25s -> 13063.29s]  So I've tried to, at least recently,
[13063.29s -> 13065.81s]  in the last probably three, four plus years,
[13065.81s -> 13068.73s]  is just to do one thing at a time
[13068.73s -> 13071.78s]  and just get it done and do that first
[13071.78s -> 13074.22s]  because there are, especially if we're talking about
[13074.22s -> 13076.90s]  just even for streaming, the stuff that I wanna do,
[13076.90s -> 13079.70s]  I have things that I'm starting to want to plan out
[13079.70s -> 13082.14s]  that are gonna be three, four, five plus months
[13082.14s -> 13083.94s]  from now in 2020,
[13083.94s -> 13086.58s]  but there's other stuff that takes precedence first
[13086.58s -> 13089.10s]  that's happening now or sooner
[13089.10s -> 13093.20s]  and you gotta do it one step at a time.
[13093.20s -> 13094.28s]  It's really easy to get overwhelmed
[13094.28s -> 13099.82s]  when you overwhelm yourself, one at a time.
[13099.82s -> 13101.97s]  But thanks a lot.
[13101.97s -> 13106.27s]  Thanks for the 500 bits.
[13106.27s -> 13108.23s]  Xwar2, thanks for the 300 bits.
[13108.23s -> 13109.83s]  Enjoy the dinner date with Kim Germa.
[13109.83s -> 13111.67s]  This is like my third ever Twitch stream of yours.
[13111.67s -> 13118.08s]  Also, it's pronounced Xwar2.
[13118.08s -> 13122.73s]  All right, but I think I said Xwar2, Xwar2.
[13122.73s -> 13125.02s]  Thank you.
[13125.02s -> 13126.46s]  Welcome, hope you like it.
[13126.46s -> 13128.10s]  This is the third time you've ever seen a stream.
[13128.10s -> 13130.06s]  I'm not sure if you've ever seen anything else,
[13130.06s -> 13132.67s]  but what's going on?
[13132.67s -> 13137.87s]  Thanks for stopping by.
[13137.87s -> 13141.08s]  We'll see you again.
[13141.08s -> 13146.77s]  Beck Ali, thank Beck Ali or Beck Ali for the 400 bits.
[13146.77s -> 13147.97s]  Thanks a lot.
[13147.97s -> 13149.29s]  They say, hey Germa, watching your videos
[13149.29s -> 13151.61s]  really helps with my depression and shit.
[13151.61s -> 13153.13s]  I wanna say thank you.
[13153.13s -> 13154.89s]  Also, I used to have pet rats
[13154.89s -> 13160.02s]  and they're amazing like little dogs.
[13160.02s -> 13164.64s]  Yeah, and they're insanely smart too.
[13164.64s -> 13169.10s]  They're very, very smart animals.
[13169.10s -> 13169.92s]  But whatever you're going through,
[13169.92s -> 13175.93s]  I'm sorry to hear that.
[13175.93s -> 13177.69s]  Hopefully you can go day by day
[13177.69s -> 13181.54s]  and start feeling a little better.
[13181.62s -> 13182.82s]  Rats are fucking awesome.
[13186.30s -> 13187.70s]  Year of the rat too.
[13187.70s -> 13190.43s]  Year of the rat, pet rats.
[13190.43s -> 13193.57s]  Gotta get two though.
[13193.57s -> 13195.09s]  Otto is a rat terrier.
[13195.09s -> 13199.66s]  That's also not, that's not, I didn't make that up.
[13199.66s -> 13205.81s]  He's rat terrier.
[13205.81s -> 13209.81s]  He's 40% dachshund, 40% rat terrier,
[13209.81s -> 13213.69s]  10% Shetland sheepdog and 10% Chihuahua.
[13215.02s -> 13219.14s]  We got the real data.
[13219.14s -> 13223.74s]  He's an actual rat.
[13223.74s -> 13225.86s]  But thank you, Beck Ali.
[13225.86s -> 13228.62s]  Appreciate it.
[13228.62s -> 13232.16s]  We also have 300 bits from Gray the Color.
[13232.16s -> 13235.25s]  Thank you, Gray.
[13235.25s -> 13236.09s]  Great stream tonight.
[13236.09s -> 13238.89s]  Would like to see more co-op with you and Joel.
[13238.89s -> 13239.85s]  A lot of people recommended it,
[13239.85s -> 13242.53s]  but will you be playing SWAT 4 anytime in the future?
[13242.53s -> 13244.49s]  Also, do you ever finish that petition
[13244.49s -> 13246.65s]  to get Burger Boy to permanently wear a bib?
[13246.65s -> 13254.13s]  Permanently.
[13254.13s -> 13260.71s]  Oh, that's so fucking stupid.
[13260.71s -> 13263.19s]  Yeah, this bit, there's so many games
[13263.19s -> 13267.09s]  that I just wanna play co-op or not.
[13267.09s -> 13269.41s]  They just go in a line and then you do one
[13269.41s -> 13271.21s]  and then one gets put behind you,
[13271.21s -> 13273.48s]  you see it, you wanna do it.
[13273.48s -> 13278.92s]  Well, I'll give you just a perfect example of this.
[13278.92s -> 13281.52s]  The SWAT series.
[13281.52s -> 13286.59s]  Me and Star were going to play SWAT,
[13286.59s -> 13288.27s]  like SWAT 3, SWAT 4.
[13289.43s -> 13291.84s]  There's no online anymore.
[13291.84s -> 13295.30s]  We were going to do this like five years ago.
[13295.30s -> 13297.94s]  We just, it was just too much for pain in the ass.
[13297.94s -> 13301.50s]  We've been talking about that for like fucking every year.
[13301.86s -> 13304.34s]  Star and I are just like, oh yeah, we'll do it.
[13304.34s -> 13307.36s]  It was always just a pain in the ass to do.
[13307.36s -> 13309.48s]  But that was a conversation that we would have
[13309.48s -> 13315.69s]  over almost a half decade.
[13315.69s -> 13317.65s]  SWAT 4 multiplayer still works.
[13317.65s -> 13319.33s]  You just have to get it from GOG.
[13322.97s -> 13327.22s]  Is that for real?
[13327.22s -> 13329.58s]  I always thought you had to get in a server
[13329.58s -> 13332.02s]  and you had to make a server or something.
[13332.02s -> 13338.03s]  I'll have to look into that.
[13338.03s -> 13340.06s]  I'll have to look into that.
[13340.06s -> 13340.90s]  He doesn't know.
[13340.90s -> 13348.84s]  No, I don't know.
[13348.84s -> 13350.20s]  It's super easy.
[13350.20s -> 13351.92s]  All right, I'll figure it out.
[13351.92s -> 13354.91s]  All right, well, add it to the list
[13354.91s -> 13358.61s]  after beautiful Joe one and two.
[13358.61s -> 13360.85s]  So many games I want to play now.
[13360.85s -> 13366.00s]  Oh, too many games.
[13366.00s -> 13367.04s]  But thank you, Gray the Cutler.
[13367.04s -> 13369.03s]  Thanks for the 300 bits.
[13369.03s -> 13372.20s]  Stephunky Chicken, thanks for the 400 bits.
[13372.20s -> 13373.36s]  The best root beer is mug.
[13373.36s -> 13375.20s]  That's a weird way to say A and W.
[13375.20s -> 13376.44s]  Well, I didn't say it was the best.
[13376.44s -> 13379.04s]  I just said it was the one, I said it was really good.
[13379.04s -> 13382.96s]  Did I say it was the best?
[13382.96s -> 13384.76s]  I didn't say it was the best, did I?
[13384.76s -> 13389.22s]  I did.
[13389.22s -> 13390.74s]  Oh, well, I probably shouldn't have said that.
[13390.74s -> 13392.47s]  I misspoke.
[13392.47s -> 13393.31s]  I misspoke.
[13400.83s -> 13403.26s]  But thank you, Stephunky Chicken.
[13403.26s -> 13406.10s]  Mehdi Marin, thanks for the 500 bits.
[13406.10s -> 13407.66s]  Hey, Germo.
[13407.66s -> 13408.74s]  Yeah.
[13408.74s -> 13410.26s]  Were you ever considering returning the games
[13410.26s -> 13412.18s]  in the Monster Hunter series?
[13412.18s -> 13413.86s]  The Switch has a couple games in world recently
[13413.86s -> 13415.78s]  got the Iceborne expansion.
[13415.78s -> 13417.98s]  And was there any reason you never returned?
[13420.01s -> 13421.17s]  I just think that after a while,
[13421.17s -> 13425.83s]  it's almost like streaming an MMO in a way.
[13425.83s -> 13427.19s]  You know the thing that you're going to do.
[13427.19s -> 13430.79s]  You're gonna go do the same thing at least.
[13430.79s -> 13432.23s]  Well, we're gonna kill this monster
[13432.23s -> 13433.63s]  like three or four times.
[13433.63s -> 13436.91s]  I think I got most of what I wanted out of it on stream.
[13438.58s -> 13440.70s]  Grind, not necessarily like the grind,
[13440.70s -> 13450.16s]  but when I turn on a stream, I'd rather do that off stream.
[13450.16s -> 13451.36s]  Not that I don't think the game would be,
[13451.36s -> 13453.96s]  I think it's boring, that's not the right word.
[13453.96s -> 13461.12s]  But it just takes a long time to do stuff in Monster Hunter.
[13464.21s -> 13466.49s]  There's a lot of setup and then there's a lot,
[13466.49s -> 13469.85s]  oh, you're just kind of going for that one weapon.
[13469.85s -> 13470.69s]  I need that tail.
[13470.69s -> 13471.53s]  I need that tail.
[13471.53s -> 13472.37s]  I need that tail.
[13472.37s -> 13473.21s]  I need that tail.
[13473.21s -> 13474.03s]  I need that tail.
[13474.03s -> 13474.87s]  I need that tail.
[13474.87s -> 13475.71s]  I need that tail.
[13475.71s -> 13476.53s]  I need that tail.
[13476.53s -> 13477.37s]  I got the tail.
[13477.37s -> 13478.21s]  I need that claw.
[13478.21s -> 13479.03s]  I need that claw.
[13479.03s -> 13479.87s]  I need that claw.
[13479.87s -> 13482.46s]  I need that claw.
[13482.46s -> 13484.02s]  I need that claw.
[13484.02s -> 13485.99s]  I need that claw.
[13485.99s -> 13489.58s]  I need that tail.
[13489.58s -> 13491.02s]  I need that tooth.
[13491.02s -> 13492.70s]  And it ends up going something like this.
[13492.70s -> 13493.52s]  I need that claw.
[13493.52s -> 13494.36s]  I need that tooth.
[13494.36s -> 13495.18s]  I need that tail.
[13495.18s -> 13496.02s]  I need that tooth.
[13496.02s -> 13496.86s]  I need that tail.
[13496.86s -> 13497.70s]  I need that tail.
[13497.70s -> 13498.52s]  I need that tooth.
[13498.52s -> 13501.78s]  I need that tail.
[13501.78s -> 13505.85s]  I need that tail.
[13505.85s -> 13506.69s]  I need that tail.
[13506.69s -> 13507.53s]  I need that tail.
[13507.53s -> 13509.06s]  I need that tail.
[13509.06s -> 13509.88s]  I need that tail.
[13509.88s -> 13512.30s]  I need that tail.
[13512.30s -> 13513.14s]  I need that tail.
[13513.64s -> 13514.46s]  I need that claw.
[13514.46s -> 13515.30s]  I need that tail.
[13515.30s -> 13519.00s]  I need that claw.
[13519.00s -> 13523.35s]  And then I kind of just give up.
[13523.35s -> 13524.63s]  Sans, hold on.
[13540.91s -> 13544.70s]  I didn't know I could even do that.
[13544.70s -> 13549.00s]  I need that claw.
[13549.00s -> 13551.10s]  I didn't even know I could do that shit.
[13551.10s -> 13553.96s]  Wow, that's kind of fun.
[13553.96s -> 13554.96s]  Cool assisted improv.
[13554.96s -> 13559.82s]  I didn't know I could even do that.
[13559.82s -> 13560.84s]  Now I'm quieter?
[13563.01s -> 13566.23s]  There we go, there we go.
[13566.23s -> 13567.92s]  But probably the answer is no.
[13567.92s -> 13571.17s]  I don't have a reason to release stream it.
[13571.17s -> 13573.53s]  Lost 100 to me is more fun
[13573.53s -> 13575.77s]  if I can just sit with my mouth open
[13575.77s -> 13581.46s]  and I need that tail for like four hours straight.
[13581.46s -> 13582.65s]  Thank you though.
[13582.65s -> 13584.57s]  Let's get the credits on screen.
[13584.57s -> 13586.85s]  Credits, credits, credits, credits, credits, credits,
[13586.85s -> 13600.01s]  credits, credits, credits, credits, credits.
[13600.01s -> 13600.85s]  Are they actually gonna show up?
[13600.85s -> 13604.44s]  I hope so.
[13604.44s -> 13605.60s]  These are all the subs and all the bits.
[13605.60s -> 13607.16s]  No, they're not all the subs.
[13607.16s -> 13610.60s]  There's no bit credits.
[13610.60s -> 13615.63s]  Play Mortal Kombat 11 on stream, shaking my head.
[13615.63s -> 13618.30s]  But why would I play Mortal Kombat 11
[13618.30s -> 13626.73s]  if I can get diarrhea'd on by people that know how to play?
[13626.73s -> 13634.88s]  Thank you for the subscription guys.
[13634.88s -> 13638.23s]  Have a fantastic rest of your night.
[13638.23s -> 13642.59s]  Thanks for subbing all of you.
[13642.59s -> 13644.59s]  Please do the Kylo Ren voice.
[13644.59s -> 13647.91s]  I can't do the fucking Kylo Ren voice.
[13647.91s -> 13661.81s]  I.
[13661.81s -> 13665.62s]  That's the thing.
[13665.62s -> 13670.82s]  Sometimes you have to do what you're saying to do.
[13670.82s -> 13682.66s]  I know I can feel it.
[13682.66s -> 13685.34s]  That's just Bugleberry with a megaphone on.
[13690.81s -> 13693.45s]  That's a warehouse announcer voice?
[13693.49s -> 13694.33s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[13694.33s -> 13707.53s]  100 spaces down.
[13707.53s -> 13708.61s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[13708.61s -> 13718.03s]  It's full glass of salsa.
[13718.03s -> 13722.46s]  That was shattered in aisle number four.
[13722.46s -> 13739.41s]  Jerry, if you could.
[13739.41s -> 13741.35s]  I can do this.
[13741.35s -> 13742.75s]  Check this out, ready?
[13742.75s -> 13743.75s]  I.
[13743.75s -> 13745.10s]  Hold on.
[13745.10s -> 13748.20s]  I.
[13748.20s -> 13750.45s]  I.
[13750.45s -> 13751.29s]  I.
[13751.29s -> 13755.76s]  Wait.
[13755.76s -> 13757.57s]  I.
[13757.57s -> 13759.85s]  Do you know, oh, oh.
[13759.85s -> 13760.85s]  Wait, why is it not working?
[13760.85s -> 13763.50s]  Oh, it's not even on.
[13763.50s -> 13766.44s]  I.
[13766.48s -> 13770.64s]  Oh, it's so much fun to sing.
[13770.64s -> 13771.64s]  This exists too.
[13776.73s -> 13778.37s]  Why would there be a button for this?
[13778.37s -> 13780.13s]  Why would there be a, I'm sorry, guys.
[13780.13s -> 13781.73s]  I'm so nervous.
[13781.73s -> 13783.37s]  I didn't think I was gonna get,
[13783.37s -> 13785.65s]  I didn't think I was gonna have to come up on stage
[13785.65s -> 13786.57s]  and tell you guys anything.
[13786.57s -> 13791.21s]  But seriously, I am so excited for this,
[13791.21s -> 13793.08s]  winning this award.
[13793.08s -> 13795.68s]  And thank you, everybody.
[13795.68s -> 13797.36s]  Thank you for all the support and everything.
[13797.36s -> 13798.20s]  Good night.
[13802.62s -> 13805.04s]  Bye.
[13805.92s -> 13809.56s]  All right, I gotta go.
[13809.56s -> 13810.40s]  I gotta go.
[13810.40s -> 13811.24s]  I gotta get out of here.
[13811.24s -> 13812.08s]  I gotta go.
[13812.08s -> 13812.92s]  I gotta get out of here.
[13812.92s -> 13813.76s]  I gotta go.
[13813.76s -> 13814.60s]  I gotta get out of here.
[13814.60s -> 13815.44s]  I gotta go.
[13815.44s -> 13816.56s]  I gotta get out of here.
[13816.56s -> 13819.75s]  We're gonna raid Box Box tonight.
[13819.75s -> 13825.18s]  Box Box did a double raid over the last few days.
[13826.62s -> 13829.50s]  It was, I think there was a coordinated raid.
[13829.50s -> 13832.40s]  It was two people.
[13832.40s -> 13836.56s]  Go say hello to Box Box.
[13836.56s -> 13837.44s]  I missed a donation.
[13837.44s -> 13839.56s]  What the fuck did he do?
[13839.56s -> 13840.60s]  I did, I missed two.
[13840.60s -> 13843.33s]  Thanks, 300 Bits for Wilcorn.
[13843.33s -> 13844.17s]  Thank you, Wilcorn.
[13845.17s -> 13846.13s]  This is my first donation to anyone.
[13846.13s -> 13847.25s]  I've seen your streams for a while,
[13847.25s -> 13854.68s]  and I've wanted to say thanks for the laughs and good feels.
[13854.68s -> 13859.09s]  That thanks for even considering giving me money.
[13859.09s -> 13859.93s]  Thanks for watching.
[13859.93s -> 13862.67s]  Thanks for being here.
[13862.67s -> 13866.79s]  And then finally, it was one more thousand bit donation
[13866.79s -> 13872.89s]  from Xwar2, thanks to 10 bucks.
[13872.89s -> 13878.23s]  Say, I feel like I'm really bad at Twitch messages.
[13878.23s -> 13879.71s]  I've been enjoying your VODs from Twitch,
[13879.71s -> 13880.79s]  randomly started watching you
[13880.79s -> 13884.11s]  after the first don't talking or you'll explode stream
[13884.11s -> 13886.27s]  because of Twitter.
[13886.27s -> 13887.75s]  I don't really watch Twitch,
[13887.75s -> 13889.11s]  but I've really been enjoying your content.
[13889.11s -> 13890.91s]  You're obviously an inspired and passionate guy,
[13890.91s -> 13892.27s]  and I dig that.
[13892.27s -> 13894.27s]  The bits are for conquering my childhood game,
[13894.27s -> 13896.39s]  Simpsons Hit and Run.
[13896.39s -> 13898.32s]  I'll definitely be sticking around.
[13898.32s -> 13900.71s]  Possibly any more Mountain Blade.
[13900.71s -> 13901.75s]  If I were to go back to Mountain Blade,
[13901.75s -> 13903.43s]  it would have to be with this shitload of VODs.
[13903.43s -> 13909.17s]  Just like a total joke stream.
[13909.17s -> 13910.01s]  But thanks.
[13911.24s -> 13917.91s]  Yeah, Simpsons Hit and Run is a wild experience.
[13917.91s -> 13918.75s]  Play the new one.
[13918.75s -> 13920.51s]  Yeah, Bannerlord's coming out.
[13920.51s -> 13922.19s]  But hasn't Bannerlord been coming out
[13922.19s -> 13923.23s]  for like four years?
[13925.36s -> 13931.60s]  Is it, is that actually gonna come out?
[13931.60s -> 13932.44s]  Sadly, it has.
[13932.44s -> 13935.52s]  Hasn't it been in development for like five plus years?
[13935.52s -> 13936.84s]  Or is it 10 years actually?
[13936.84s -> 13939.20s]  Okay, it's been 10 years.
[13939.20s -> 13940.72s]  Now, but now it has a steam page.
[13940.72s -> 13941.96s]  Really? Okay.
[13941.96s -> 13947.12s]  Now you got me interested.
[13947.12s -> 13951.96s]  See, now I'm interested.
[13951.96s -> 13957.44s]  Yeah, we're gonna go send some love to Boxbox.
[13957.44s -> 13961.16s]  Got a lot of raids from Boxbox recently, like I said.
[13961.16s -> 13966.78s]  Continues to show tons of love to the stream.
[13966.78s -> 13969.25s]  Go say hello.
[13969.25s -> 13970.49s]  See you guys on Sunday.
[13970.49s -> 13974.91s]  Have a good couple nights.
[13974.91s -> 13977.25s]  That was the wrong button.
[13977.25s -> 13980.14s]  That was the right button.
[13980.14s -> 13982.33s]  See you guys Sunday.
[13982.33s -> 13983.95s]  Goodbye.
[13983.95s -> 13984.79s]  Let's raid.
[13986.07s -> 13988.60s]  I will not be participating in the raid.
[13988.60s -> 13992.25s]  I'm going to go out to dinner.
[13992.25s -> 13993.17s]  Give my best.
