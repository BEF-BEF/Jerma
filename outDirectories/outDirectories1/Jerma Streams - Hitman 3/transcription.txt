[0.89s -> 3.13s]  No, no, I'm not late and I'm not canceling.
[6.33s -> 11.32s]  I'm not late and I'm not canceling. Look what you made me do.
[11.32s -> 15.56s]  Look what you made me do. I just tried to take a sip of my coffee.
[15.56s -> 20.01s]  I stabbed my mouth right into the front of my lip. Look what you made me do.
[20.01s -> 26.74s]  Hi guys. How are you? Hope you're doing well.
[29.18s -> 36.46s]  I had a little bit of a surprise. I was kind of, I forgot that Hitman 3 came out yesterday.
[37.10s -> 40.90s]  I forgot. And here it is.
[41.70s -> 46.73s]  I have a few things to talk about with you for a little while before we go anywhere.
[48.78s -> 53.26s]  There is a very certain stream that some of you have been maybe waiting for the last week.
[54.22s -> 57.02s]  Not the Catboy one. Don't worry. That's being worked on too.
[57.02s -> 60.54s]  All of you Catboy enthusiasts. Just hold on.
[62.39s -> 70.02s]  So the Bionicle movie, interestingly enough, I cannot stream that to Twitch.
[71.10s -> 79.18s]  I need the rights to it. That's something that I cannot do.
[79.18s -> 86.54s]  But hold on a second. Hold on a minute. Reach out and see if they'll let me do it.
[87.42s -> 90.14s]  So right now we're reaching out to see if that's something I can do.
[90.70s -> 95.53s]  We're in the process of reaching out. Probably going to get instantly denied.
[96.17s -> 99.13s]  But you know, we're probably going to get denied.
[99.13s -> 101.37s]  Look, there's like all kinds of music and shit in there.
[102.81s -> 106.73s]  I don't have the distribution rights to show that even though it's free on YouTube.
[108.81s -> 111.53s]  There's a lot of legal gray area there.
[112.25s -> 116.49s]  So that's currently being worked on. Something else is being worked on too.
[118.90s -> 126.76s]  There are four major, major things happening stream-wise over the next probably three months.
[128.71s -> 132.78s]  I'm just going to give you a quick little hint. I'm not going to tell you what it is.
[133.34s -> 136.06s]  If you haven't even heard me talk about this. What's going on here?
[136.62s -> 140.55s]  There's like a floating thing of dust right here. Get out of here.
[141.77s -> 144.33s]  I'm going to say two words. That's all I'm going to say.
[145.05s -> 147.69s]  You will see this within the next couple of months.
[149.51s -> 156.26s]  The archaeologist stream. Maybe work your brain around what that means.
[163.96s -> 171.03s]  The first word was not even a word. It was a beginning. A preposition? What is it?
[172.18s -> 180.55s]  What's a the? It's not a noun. It's not a verb. What is it? It's an article.
[183.18s -> 187.42s]  Oh, okay. Whatever. Yeah, the title's bad. Whatever.
[188.14s -> 195.32s]  What is a preposition? It's an article adjective.
[195.32s -> 197.72s]  Yeah, what's a preposition though? What does that do? What does that mean?
[202.73s -> 207.05s]  You see, you should what? You should see if you can get on the coliseum.
[207.05s -> 214.94s]  I don't even know what that is. The location or time. Okay, cool.
[215.90s -> 221.26s]  Yeah, there's also there's a lot. This is the baseball stream is happening.
[223.75s -> 228.62s]  Every like 20 to 30 days here, as of like the 1st of February,
[229.90s -> 236.46s]  this is going to be something else. 2020 got destroyed for big streams.
[237.18s -> 239.99s]  Two of them were pretty much already paid for and ready to go.
[239.99s -> 244.23s]  One of them in particular had to be cancelled. So we had to move a bunch of stuff from 2020
[244.23s -> 254.06s]  into 2021. So 2021 is going to be stacked. It's going to be loaded with potentially fun stuff to
[254.06s -> 266.49s]  do. Is this going to be the best year ever on the channel? I've refused to say that because
[266.49s -> 270.33s]  if I say that, then it might be the worst year on the channel. I'm not going to do that.
[272.26s -> 277.18s]  No, this might be some fun things to do. I can't say that if you say that all of a sudden,
[277.18s -> 286.42s]  it's become something. It's now if it's not, then Oh, every year is better than the last year
[286.42s -> 299.99s]  until it's not muck. It's year of the cat boy. Are you peddling fried chicken to people? I saw
[299.99s -> 306.71s]  that. What am I supposed to do about it? You want to see how far that meme has left this community?
[306.71s -> 311.83s]  Like we talked about two or three weeks ago, look no further than the Kentucky fried chicken
[312.39s -> 323.80s]  account on Twitter. KFC underscore es. It's the it's the it's the it's Espanol, right? It's the
[323.80s -> 330.73s]  Spain version. Yeah. The Spanish Kentucky fried chicken. They made me Colonel Sanders with the
[330.73s -> 335.53s]  sus face thing. That's just how you know it's out of our control anymore. And I can't I can't
[335.53s -> 347.21s]  control it anymore. What's that thing? I'm gonna tell my kids that this was Colonel Sanders.
[349.24s -> 362.20s]  I mean, that's that's funny. I think it could be. So what do you mean? What am I supposed to do?
[364.28s -> 367.80s]  Do you think the Kentucky fried chicken Twitter account made any money on that post?
[368.36s -> 377.03s]  But should I like claim that post? What does that get me?
[377.67s -> 389.18s]  Do you see a them? No, I don't I don't care. If I'm not going to go after the people that used me
[389.18s -> 394.38s]  in a porn ad, am I going to go? Am I going to try to go after Kentucky fried chicken Spain?
[394.94s -> 407.88s]  Are you guys out of your minds? I mean, what? What? What? What? I don't know. Is it? You guys
[407.88s -> 411.56s]  weren't around for that? That wasn't that long ago. That was only like a few months ago. It was like
[411.56s -> 421.96s]  six months ago. No, I don't think it's funny. Whatever. If people want to have fun with that
[421.96s -> 429.64s]  image, that what do you want me to say? It's okay. Does. Let me ask you this. Does bad luck Brian
[429.64s -> 444.63s]  like sue somebody for using the bad luck Brian image? What do you want me to say? He should.
[447.37s -> 454.82s]  You are no bad luck, Brian. Um, I didn't say I was. I just just saying that like
[455.54s -> 458.82s]  once it's kind of on the internet, it goes out there. What am I going to do about it?
[460.76s -> 467.67s]  You are no bad luck, Brian. Oh, let me just dump an entire bottle of detergent on the ground real
[467.67s -> 480.38s]  quick. Almost done. There it is. Gotta clean my room. Gotta clean my room. Gotta clean my room.
[481.26s -> 485.86s]  Little horse today for some reason strized end effect for exposure.
[486.58s -> 493.83s]  What was that? That was a fucking fresh. Let's hey, let's let's let's get let's open it. Let's
[493.83s -> 502.74s]  see what it sounds like. Yeah, that's as a fresh fuel. Let's get a good sip of this berry fuel.
[512.26s -> 516.90s]  No soy in that. Shut that mouth of yours. We're gonna play the hitman three today.
[518.33s -> 526.09s]  There's no soy in it. There's no soy in this bottle. I like this shit and I'm not sponsored
[526.09s -> 542.06s]  by them. I was kind of cool, you know? No, I'm kidding. I actually this helped me gain weight,
[542.06s -> 546.30s]  helped me put on some weight back when I was having some trouble. So no, they get a they get
[546.30s -> 554.17s]  a stamp of approval from me. They're peanuts. They're peanuts and heal. They're peanuts and
[554.17s -> 557.53s]  heal. They're peanuts and heal. They're peanuts and heal. They're peanuts and heal. Okay. Oh,
[557.53s -> 562.49s]  okay. Did I say gross to that? What are you able to say? That's fine. What's wrong with that?
[563.29s -> 571.59s]  Where are the peanuts? Contains tree nuts, coconut. So you were wrong. This coconut,
[571.59s -> 579.61s]  there's tree nuts in this. It's like probably made in the same plant that produces nuts or something.
[579.61s -> 592.70s]  Free nuts equal peanuts. Free nuts are unshelled soy. What the fuck are you talking about?
[592.70s -> 602.26s]  Oh, that's you're ridiculous. All right, hold on. Uh, where am I going here? I need to put this up.
[602.82s -> 609.99s]  Yeah, apparently, from what I've heard, guys, I heard Hitman three is like unbelievable.
[610.63s -> 621.30s]  Thanks to the 10 subs. Watch Meister. I've heard this is the best one yet. Very excited. Those of
[621.30s -> 628.74s]  you that know this channel, we are, we are Hitmen enthusiasts. Hitman two was one of my favorite
[628.74s -> 634.98s]  games that came out a couple of years ago. The new kind of re-handled. I'm sorry. I've read
[634.98s -> 643.43s]  somebody that said 1080 can't handle it and you just threw me off completely. Um, what was I doing?
[643.43s -> 653.37s]  Anyways, uh, well, I did, I think it'd be fine. If it's not, then whatever. I heard it's very good.
[653.37s -> 660.65s]  So I'm looking forward to it. We're just going to play it. I have no set. Uh, I want to do the VR,
[661.37s -> 670.15s]  but it's PSVR only. I was serious. I, I, all right. I had a PSVR and I gave it away. I just,
[670.15s -> 674.38s]  I gave it to somebody because I was like, I'm never going to fucking use this ever again,
[674.38s -> 679.64s]  ever. It was not a single reason in my mind where that would ever turn on ever again.
[679.64s -> 690.23s]  Because I had the Vive. If you buy a Vive and you have a PSVR, what's the point of having the PSVR
[690.23s -> 706.04s]  at that point? The VR is really bad though. Okay. I didn't break it. Stop. I'm procrastinating.
[706.04s -> 711.75s]  Stop procrastinating. Wait, did you just, I've read that wrong. I think the title is bad. I don't
[711.75s -> 717.90s]  care. It's just hit, man. That's all it is. That's what you came here for. My headphones,
[722.94s -> 727.98s]  stop stalling. I haven't seen you guys in like four or five, six days or something. I can't just
[727.98s -> 735.86s]  hang on and say, what's up. I can't like, I can't turn on the fucking webcam. I can't turn the
[735.86s -> 746.57s]  webcam on and I can't, what? I'm not allowed to turn on the webcam and I can't turn the webcam on.
[746.57s -> 752.71s]  Was I naked for a frame? I hope not. I can't turn the webcam on and show you this scrumptious cake.
[752.71s -> 769.93s]  What do you think about that? That's a 2021 Rice Krispie Treat planetary cake. This was supposed
[769.93s -> 774.60s]  to be shown on, hold on. How's the hair look? This was supposed to be shown on New Year's,
[774.60s -> 784.73s]  but I didn't have it. 2021. Let's go. You're a comical British villain. You guys want to
[784.73s -> 812.23s]  see something funny? That bed was like $200. That bed was like 30. Who made the cake? My mother did.
[812.87s -> 829.24s]  My mother made the cake. I'm not going to bite it. I want to preserve it. $200 dog fed. Yeah,
[829.24s -> 833.32s]  my, my, by the way, my mother's the one that made the shoe as well. Remember we talked about that?
[835.82s -> 839.34s]  Bite the cake like it's an apple. I'm not going to bite. No, I want to preserve it.
[839.34s -> 845.78s]  I want to put it in the freezer and like keep it frozen. This dude's a millionaire.
[845.78s -> 852.12s]  No, I wanted my dog to be incredibly comfortable. I wanted my dog to be incredibly comfortable.
[852.12s -> 858.36s]  Is there something wrong with that? And I'm going to spend money on my special boy.
[858.36s -> 867.37s]  He's worth spending the money on even though he doesn't even like the bed. In fact, he like
[867.37s -> 874.73s]  refuses to sleep in it now because the $30 circle bed is this is so much better. Apparently your mom
[874.73s -> 888.06s]  puts up with a lot of your shenanigans. I love my mother. Come on. She participates. Sleep on it.
[888.06s -> 898.31s]  You sleep on that one. You just keep him around for YouTube revenue. Let's get this fucking bath
[898.31s -> 906.14s]  robot because it's hot and I can just be naked like I was the way I should be. Make sure I don't
[906.14s -> 912.50s]  accidentally turn the camera on because no, that would be very bad. Okay. This game is so good. I
[912.50s -> 924.31s]  know. I'm so looking forward to it. IO interactive just gets so much credit from me so much. I want
[924.31s -> 930.90s]  you to think of a company that is made that has like a franchise like this. They, they bought out
[930.90s -> 935.22s]  their assets. They bought them out. They pulled away from Square Enix. They, they were like,
[935.22s -> 940.63s]  you know, fuck it. We're buying you out. We're buying out our shit from you. They went over.
[940.63s -> 945.35s]  They made Hitman, Hitman 2, this one Hitman 3. They know what they can do. They know what they're good
[945.35s -> 958.34s]  at and they just do it. And all of these have been very, very, very good. Nobody talks about this.
[958.34s -> 962.42s]  Nobody talks about how Square, I almost said Square Enix. That was wrong. Nobody, does anybody
[962.42s -> 966.84s]  talk about how good of like how great IO interactive is with their releases? It's been like every,
[966.92s -> 970.01s]  they just, they know what they're doing. How do we talk? But people are always like,
[970.01s -> 980.50s]  I love Bethesda. No, no, no. Love IO interactive. That's better. You said, you already said that.
[980.50s -> 990.87s]  So what? This might be like one of my favorite game companies. Okay. Are you guys ready? I'm excited.
[990.87s -> 1007.13s]  God damn it. I should, whatever. God. Great. Is my, turn the cam on. No. Wait, I gotta make a pasta.
[1007.13s -> 1017.03s]  You, I, it's 4 PM Pacific. You had time? Stop stalling. Stop stalling. This is like my favorite
[1017.03s -> 1022.62s]  game of the year. This is going to be my favorite release of the year. I play like four new games
[1022.62s -> 1028.25s]  a year. This is definitely going to be, just watch, clip this. I'm going to be sitting there
[1028.25s -> 1032.86s]  at the game awards this time next year. Hitman 3 is going to be on that list. And I'm going to be
[1032.86s -> 1036.92s]  like, Oh, I'm going to be pursing my lips, leaning back, leaning back in the bathrobe, pointing.
[1036.92s -> 1043.29s]  There it is. That's the one. And it's going to lose. It's not going to win. And I'm going to be
[1043.29s -> 1048.78s]  like, you know, I really wish I hitman 3 would have won. I'm going to be like, that's my boy.
[1048.78s -> 1057.02s]  Right. Look at this shit. You can just, I can play them all. I can play every single one of these.
[1057.02s -> 1067.43s]  Is agent 47 the super Mario of PC gaming now that we haven't seen Gordon Freeman in a long time?
[1067.43s -> 1083.58s]  Okay. Should we get like a previously on the next game of Thrones? Let's do it. All right.
[1083.58s -> 1091.48s]  We're going to do previously on the next game of Thrones. Agent 47 are the world's top assassins
[1091.48s -> 1097.70s]  working for the ICA. Unknowingly, they have been hired by a shadow client to target a number of
[1097.70s -> 1104.10s]  operatives of Providence, a secret organization working so excited. I love this game. I'm already
[1104.10s -> 1108.42s]  going to love it. I can't wait to throw a plate. The first person I see approaches Diana and makes
[1108.42s -> 1118.36s]  her eliminate the shadow client. 47 asked my past, but when my past was that the shadow client is
[1118.36s -> 1126.87s]  Lucas gray lost childhood friend. He and Diana switch sides to fulfill an old pact, destroy
[1127.83s -> 1130.63s]  louder. We need more fuel. Hold on.
[1134.07s -> 1141.26s]  The three Providence partners eliminate them and the war would be over. I took my headphones out. I
[1141.26s -> 1147.42s]  have to like, however, the constant has an ace up his sleeve. I don't even need to pay attention to
[1147.42s -> 1156.90s]  the story. I know how to play hitman. Throws plates, shoes, strangle people in the bathroom
[1156.90s -> 1163.43s]  and you have a barcode on your head. That's all I know. That's all I really need to know.
[1163.43s -> 1167.19s]  Holy shit. Do you actually go in a plane in this one on top of the world?
[1171.27s -> 1175.51s]  47. This is Diana here. Come on, do it, do it, do it, do it so I can fucking just move on.
[1175.51s -> 1184.55s]  Look close. No, that's not you in the shadows behind the everyday world,
[1184.55s -> 1187.27s]  beyond the headlines and the seats of power.
[1188.62s -> 1196.36s]  Why? All right.
[1203.62s -> 1206.34s]  You get to drive a car. Did they finally let you do that in hitman?
[1206.34s -> 1211.30s]  We were just please. Do you drive a car and hitman three and throw away,
[1211.30s -> 1220.04s]  do the unthinkable, the unforgivable. And it never gave us a second thought.
[1220.04s -> 1226.07s]  Okay. If it's a full letter grade, if I can drive a car, what if it's an A after decades in the
[1226.07s -> 1238.02s]  shadows? We are fighting because the S me and 47 much has been lost, but we are closer than ever.
[1239.67s -> 1246.07s]  We trapped the constant Providence is chief control and finally learned the names.
[1246.07s -> 1256.42s]  Don't see very much water in their downfall, asked to rest and just maybe.
[1258.15s -> 1263.67s]  Look, they must've had plenty of heel on them. I'm not. Okay. I'm done doing this.
[1263.67s -> 1283.96s]  I'm not sponsored by this company. Hitman hitman pause button, not an Xbox control.
[1284.84s -> 1300.47s]  This is the Xbox version. You know, I never planned this far ahead.
[1301.35s -> 1309.03s]  You never do. I just got his memory back. Wait, is that a beacon?
[1309.99s -> 1314.23s]  Is it? Whoa, pull it, pull it, pull it, pull the wire.
[1324.18s -> 1328.42s]  I would laugh so hard if it's, if I took control now and the first mission was to kill the guy in
[1328.42s -> 1337.35s]  the helicopter, the pilot fly over there. And I think I know why the constant has escaped.
[1337.43s -> 1341.91s]  He persuaded one of the sailors into setting him free. And since then he's been seizing
[1341.91s -> 1347.03s]  control of Providence assets and resources. I can only assume Carlisle is rushing to contain
[1347.03s -> 1353.11s]  the damage. If she slips away again, we'll keep track of her. Make sure she doesn't make sure
[1353.11s -> 1358.47s]  she doesn't get away and stays the same. Your destination is the sector. The world's tallest
[1358.47s -> 1362.87s]  building where the partners are laying low. Throw people off the building, right? Come on.
[1362.87s -> 1368.95s]  Carl Ghazali. Marcus Stuyvesant is fifth generation old money. His family made its fortune
[1368.95s -> 1374.79s]  in real estate and banking and were at one point the chief landowners in New York. Carl Ingram is
[1374.79s -> 1378.87s]  a powerful Washington kingmaker. I thought that was the one ring for a second. I'm like, holy
[1378.87s -> 1384.15s]  shit. During the American civil war and later established a globe spanning empire in oil,
[1384.15s -> 1390.07s]  coal and steel. Both families long since retreated from public view, but their quiet dominance
[1390.07s -> 1396.95s]  endures to this day. Now, the partners likely suspect that we're coming. So Mr. Gray will
[1396.95s -> 1402.39s]  infiltrate building controls and disable all electronic doors and elevators. Stuyvesant and
[1402.39s -> 1410.42s]  Ingram are about to find they have nowhere left to run. Lockdown is this one. How tall is this
[1410.42s -> 1417.00s]  building? This is our moment, 47. Providence ruined our lives with a flick of a pen. Today
[1417.96s -> 1426.44s]  we return the faith. Happy hunting. Mission active. Oh god, IO Interactive just fucking nails it
[1426.44s -> 1439.46s]  every time. All right, we got a target is Carl Ingram and Marcus Stuyvesant. Okay, kill conditions.
[1440.76s -> 1443.96s]  Any method, any disguise. We're not doing any weird mischief. That's gonna play.
[1445.11s -> 1453.03s]  Difficulty is on, uh, yeah, just professional. That's fine. Unlimited saves. We can just,
[1453.03s -> 1456.23s]  story missions are there. I'm not playing on master. I just like walking around and strangling
[1456.23s -> 1467.29s]  people. All right, we just gotta kill these guys. You ready? Now I know what to say. Stuy?
[1467.29s -> 1473.46s]  Professionals have standards. He's bad at the game. I haven't even pressed play yet.
[1474.42s -> 1482.73s]  I haven't even started playing. What are you talking about? All right, here's the real test.
[1482.73s -> 1488.31s]  Uh, is because my computer play this game and a big lead up leading to it. Let's see if I can
[1488.31s -> 1500.46s]  stream the game. Welcome to Dubai. 47. Oh, look at those hot air balloons. Today is the inauguration
[1500.46s -> 1508.87s]  of the scepter and the ceremony is well underway. You will find me near the building's signature
[1508.87s -> 1516.31s]  art installation. Well, apparently Carl Ingram has ensconced himself in his penthouse suite
[1516.31s -> 1523.46s]  security on highest alert. Let's do like an alley hoop with a grenade, a floor under done. What?
[1523.46s -> 1532.42s]  Good luck. 47. Wait, what? 47. Oh my God. 47. Do you copy? I'm here. I will be shitting my
[1532.42s -> 1544.79s]  pants right now. Okay. Wait, I forget how to play hitman though. How do you play hitman?
[1545.43s -> 1562.14s]  How do you play hitman? I don't even remember how to play. Can I climb this? You're a fake fan.
[1562.14s -> 1572.84s]  I needed like a, uh, I'll get it. No harness. No, why'd you? I have a parachute. What's in here?
[1573.48s -> 1581.19s]  That's a long way to go. Just do the joke already. I'm not gonna hold on. Oh, it's control. Right.
[1581.19s -> 1601.18s]  Control. You can see I snipe that guy. How do I stand up? X is climb. It's not C. Hang. All right.
[1601.18s -> 1610.42s]  And then scale. It's X is scale and climb and everything. Okay. I thought I missed. 47. Use
[1610.42s -> 1615.64s]  your camera and scan the lock, will you? I think I can override them. Use your camera? How do I
[1615.64s -> 1624.92s]  stand up? Oh, C. Okay. You guys weren't lying. Equip your camera. Press or I to open your inventory.
[1626.12s -> 1637.18s]  Camera. Aim at the camera. Are you fucking kidding me? No, they didn't. Did they, did they, did they
[1637.18s -> 1648.36s]  add this? They added a little like best buy all the way to the left camera. Are you serious? Holy
[1648.36s -> 1658.92s]  shit. That's unbelievable. Okay. Can I do a, can you take a selfie? I hope you can take a selfie.
[1658.92s -> 1674.47s]  Oops. Hide menu. How do I navigate? Cancel. Z and X. Oh shit. Look at this one. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[1679.80s -> 1696.26s]  All right. Hold on. Let's do every single wedding invitation you've ever seen. And then of the top
[1696.26s -> 1708.68s]  left here, there's like a photo of them like kissing at a movie theater. If it were me, if it
[1708.68s -> 1713.67s]  were me, they'd be like a guy in a groom outfit falling out of this balloon on the right. Just
[1713.67s -> 1718.15s]  like I'm falling out of the balloon and, and the whatever the bride would be. It's like screaming,
[1718.15s -> 1724.47s]  yelling like, oh, with like this terrified face and I'm falling. I'm like, at least what happened?
[1724.47s -> 1739.26s]  Did it upload that? Stop. What are you doing? What? What happened? It just went up to your Twitter.
[1740.81s -> 1748.89s]  I get the camera out of here. There we go. Fiber wire. That's a sprint button. I'm in position. 47.
[1748.89s -> 1754.73s]  The inauguration is taking place close by. Stop taking photos of shit. I'm sure there must be
[1754.73s -> 1760.09s]  floor plans somewhere. Understood. We need absolute focus on this one. If Ingram and
[1760.09s -> 1764.25s]  Stuyvesant are alerted to our presence, we may lose them for good. Oh, there's a coin over here.
[1764.25s -> 1778.14s]  We are so close, 47. Don't worry. I had to just see what it was like. Dude, you know what? I owe
[1778.14s -> 1782.94s]  interactive. I love you. You're like the best video game company. But let me do like, no, I don't want
[1782.94s -> 1787.08s]  to do that. I want to throw the coin to be able to throw people's eyes. I want to just be able to
[1787.08s -> 1790.76s]  baseball complete pitchers, throw this into somebody's head and try to hit him in the eye.
[1790.76s -> 1801.54s]  All right. That's what I would add. OK, here we go. But there's got to be a costume over here,
[1801.54s -> 1812.42s]  right? Oh, his drinks. That's typically might be a little too high. This is normal for a guy to be
[1812.42s -> 1842.30s]  walking in like this. Oh, OK. OK, I'm sorry. Restart the mission. Did it not save? Yeah,
[1842.30s -> 1861.05s]  this is for you. No, it didn't save, right? So I just restarted. Wait, just how do I die? Somebody
[1861.05s -> 1893.96s]  kill me. Somebody kill me. Somebody kill me. Kill me. Kill me. Thank you. OK, here we go. Load.
[1896.81s -> 1902.28s]  There we are. OK, let's go. You have to just punch somebody when you first. It's like GTA.
[1902.28s -> 1908.73s]  The first 45 minutes that anybody plays Hitman, it's the first 45 minutes that you play GTA.
[1909.45s -> 1913.85s]  Don't lie to me. You run over the first person you see, you punch the first person in the face
[1913.85s -> 1919.37s]  and you just shoot a rocket into the sky. That's what it hit, man. The first thing you do,
[1919.37s -> 1924.04s]  punch the first person in the face, strangle the first person in the bathroom position.
[1925.40s -> 1930.04s]  And then you play the game close by. Once you've infiltrated it, get your bearings.
[1930.04s -> 1935.72s]  I'm sure there must be floor plans somewhere. Understood. We need. You're a psychopath.
[1937.08s -> 1944.39s]  No, and we all are. We may lose them for good. We are so close. 47. Don't worry. You're telling
[1944.39s -> 1949.35s]  me the first thing you did in GTA 5 was not immediately punch the first pedestrian you
[1949.35s -> 1960.70s]  find the first one immediately. No, would you would you stop at every red light?
[1960.70s -> 1972.57s]  All right, here we go. It's time. All right. So now we go. Here we go. What's this quicksave?
[1973.29s -> 1995.38s]  What's quicksave? Is there no quicksave? Is it F5? I don't see it on here. It's F5 is there.
[1995.38s -> 2014.68s]  There is none. F5. It's not F5. Okay, here we go. Eliminate. Thank you. This is cool. All right.
[2014.68s -> 2028.26s]  Hold on. I need to change sensitivity. Way too high. Let's go with the 45. My most importantly.
[2028.26s -> 2038.76s]  All right. Bright light. Holy shit. So we drink. You've served drinks. I'm trying to get a drink.
[2039.40s -> 2070.63s]  You have a tray of drinks. Was this weird if I come up to try to get one? What? Whoa. Sorry.
[2074.15s -> 2078.95s]  It's been. Look, it's been a couple of years. I need to. I'm going to do this. Welcome to the
[2078.95s -> 2104.55s]  next like fucking six hours, guys. That wasn't the target. The bit rate is fucked. Is it? Oh,
[2104.55s -> 2107.59s]  because of the sun. I see. All right. So let's I'm going to I'm going to I have to be a good
[2107.59s -> 2113.69s]  at Hitman. I brought this up before. Playing Hitman the right way is like driving and stopping
[2113.69s -> 2149.03s]  at every red light in GTA. It's very hard to do. Okay. Very cool. Thank you. All right.
[2149.03s -> 2155.88s]  Where we're looking for we're looking for an opportunity. Okay, back here. Let me just I'm
[2155.88s -> 2170.17s]  going to schmooze for a little bit. You'll breathe one. Looking for an opportunity. Anybody have an
[2170.17s -> 2177.54s]  opportunity for me? What are they? What can I do with these? Can I walk up here? Is it allowed?
[2185.99s -> 2189.42s]  Who's talking?
[2196.01s -> 2205.99s]  This guy? I don't know. I don't know who is just talking. The guy in the jacket.
[2206.71s -> 2218.17s]  Okay, this guy is looking for private access to the guy's penthouse upstairs.
[2218.17s -> 2223.59s]  I'm going to follow this guy around for a little bit. You have to subdue this guy.
[2223.59s -> 2231.16s]  Hold on. I have to know what the plan is. Kill him now. I'm not going to kill him now. I'm looking.
[2231.16s -> 2244.71s]  You need I need an opportunity. Wait, so Whipple just guessed at the party. So he doesn't have
[2244.71s -> 2254.20s]  like special access to anything. Upstairs. Do you by any chance know who's staying here?
[2254.20s -> 2261.11s]  You smoking here? I hear it's not just the world. Ask you politely to move along.
[2261.11s -> 2279.42s]  Is this guy a hitman too? We're both hitmen. Is this another player? 47. I would like to address
[2279.42s -> 2287.11s]  the Providence partners directly. What's this? Them to know why this is happening. And I have
[2287.11s -> 2293.13s]  an idea. But it requires you finding a map terminal. Wait, I can't just I was just about
[2293.13s -> 2296.89s]  to just hold right trigger and just shoot a like I was gonna shoot that guy in the red dragon.
[2299.66s -> 2307.67s]  Listen, I want to talk to the partners directly. Make them understand why all of this is happening.
[2307.67s -> 2314.95s]  And that terminal gives me an idea. Okay, there's a server room personal reception. If you can gain
[2314.95s -> 2320.07s]  access to it, we might server room useful Intel from it. Okay, we'll have to work together to
[2320.07s -> 2325.35s]  hack the system. But it's our best. Is this person actually in my ear? Should I follow this one?
[2326.15s -> 2345.16s]  Okay, we have bird of prey. Here we go. Let's follow this one. Let's do it. Interact with the
[2345.16s -> 2358.33s]  map. Didn't I push button? Oh, it looks like the staff area could provide you with a viable route
[2358.33s -> 2368.60s]  to the server. Push it harder. Okay, staff area. What do you got on yours? What iPad game do you
[2368.60s -> 2394.50s]  have? Why can I? How do I get up? Get up? I can't get up. I can't get up. I can't get up.
[2403.40s -> 2422.81s]  Here it comes. No, I'm fine. I infiltrate the staff area. Wait, an apple. I eat it. It might
[2422.81s -> 2425.77s]  be an opportunity that presents itself right there. Oh, you can throw an apple in somebody's
[2425.77s -> 2442.49s]  face. Oh my god. Okay, I'm just gonna, I'm gonna bring an apple. I'm gonna go this way. Staff room
[2442.49s -> 2447.94s]  I probably need a staff coat. There's a keypad lock on the doors to the staff area. That's the
[2447.94s -> 2460.68s]  staff right there. One moment. All right, try this. 4706. 47. What are you doing? 47. Yeah,
[2460.68s -> 2470.12s]  I have the code. 47. I don't know why you're doing this. I have the code. It's four. Okay.
[2471.82s -> 2482.46s]  You go to staff outfit. Nice job. Where's your code again? It's four. Uh, 47. What was the code?
[2483.02s -> 2510.47s]  That's not it. How do I? What are the, what's the code? 47 something? 4708. It's not right. 4706.
[2511.27s -> 2517.82s]  That's not it. Oh, it is. Okay, I have to press okay. There's quite a bit of security here.
[2519.13s -> 2524.54s]  One moment. You ready for some more fresh air? 47. I got this cool costume now.
[2530.92s -> 2535.88s]  Wait, we have an opportunity. His highness has everyone working triple shifts. There's so much
[2535.88s -> 2540.76s]  going on here of a full staff update meetings already. And now that crazy manager called us
[2540.76s -> 2545.64s]  into another meeting. So now we've got to memorize new lists of guest names, new passwords for the
[2545.64s -> 2551.32s]  terminals and new special dietary needs. Yep. What else? To the amount of information the human
[2551.32s -> 2558.28s]  brain can contain. What else? Pretty sure I've hit it. And to top it off. Don't forget that.
[2558.28s -> 2564.01s]  We wouldn't be getting overtime payment because we're just expected to be here. Can you believe this?
[2564.01s -> 2571.13s]  Got a wrench over here? You got, you have to have a wrench in there, right? Oh, they don't,
[2571.13s -> 2575.38s]  do they care? What if I, okay, they're not going to care, right? What if I need this for something?
[2577.32s -> 2582.74s]  Just throw a cigarette on the ground. You just littered a cigarette. How do I like to,
[2582.74s -> 2589.32s]  how do I go stop? You violated the law. Littering. That'll be 400 coin.
[2590.74s -> 2599.58s]  Fuck you, guard. You were just watching. Oh my God. That was horrible.
[2620.63s -> 2624.79s]  Don't mind me. I'm just getting a can. Oh, bathroom. Pog. Pog bathroom.
[2625.43s -> 2636.54s]  Toilet control panel. Oh shit. What is malfunctioning? Is there a camera in the
[2636.54s -> 2654.47s]  bathroom? I think that's stuck. I think that's going to be stuck there for a very long time.
[2655.43s -> 2661.21s]  Can I plunge somebody? What? Wait, do you have a card? Oh, he's got something. What's this?
[2661.93s -> 2676.38s]  He has some other stuff on him. I don't know why I was just trying to flush him down the toilet.
[2679.64s -> 2718.78s]  Wait, people won't come in here now. Put it down. Good enough. No, no, no. Just, like I say, repent?
[2720.49s -> 2736.92s]  Repent! Give me the axe. Wait, a pair of scissors too. I want those. All right,
[2736.92s -> 2773.16s]  get in the server room. Fringe browsing. Okay. Well, would that just use the coin to do that?
[2773.72s -> 2779.61s]  I think I can open that window remotely. Cool. All right, to do it with your camera and I'll have a
[2779.61s -> 2798.68s]  try. Camera, you got it. What is it? What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?
[2803.51s -> 2826.62s]  Okay. How do I get? How close can I get? Flash right in the face. How do I save this photo?
[2828.86s -> 2830.47s]  How do I save this photo?
[2833.98s -> 2844.01s]  What kind of system is that? That all sounds pretty harmless.
[2844.01s -> 2855.83s]  Wait, do they care that I'm doing this? They must not care, right? All right, they don't care.
[2860.33s -> 2864.54s]  They're gonna watch me go out the window. I have to stop this from happening. Try to give them the...
[2865.10s -> 2879.43s]  All right, leave, leave, leave, leave. Get out of here. Throw them out. No. Why would I do that?
[2879.99s -> 2896.22s]  Because I'm not doing that. I don't need to. I want that axe though. What the fuck? Give me the axe.
[2897.02s -> 2902.92s]  Cheek Al-Ghazali is reaching out to his worldwide network of lawyers and financial contacts,
[2903.48s -> 2907.96s]  attempting to restore the lost power base of the Providence partners. How do I turn this on?
[2908.60s -> 2913.72s]  If Ingram and Stuyvesant were asked to a meeting, thinking they'll be told of new developments,
[2914.36s -> 2918.36s]  I suspect they'd jump at the chance. Is there ray tracing? I don't have a 10... I have a...
[2918.36s -> 2924.04s]  I have 1080. It can be sealed off for private conversations. If we lure the targets there,
[2924.68s -> 2939.24s]  they'll be trapped. Okay. Got it. I can't take it with me, so I might as well throw it over there.
[2939.80s -> 2969.80s]  Okay, take the scenic route. Holy shit, he's right there. All right. Shit. Whatever. What am I
[2969.80s -> 2986.14s]  supposed to do on this ledge over here? Get... What am I supposed to do? I can't get on this ledge?
[2987.00s -> 2996.09s]  Use the camera. I don't have to go down there? What am I... What's the point of this?
[2997.75s -> 3019.82s]  What? What's the point of this? What... I... What was the point of doing this? Other ledge? Use camera.
[3019.82s -> 3026.81s]  Use camera. On the other one? Use camera on the... Oh, shit. Neanderthals just came in with a raid.
[3026.81s -> 3034.68s]  What's going on, Neanderthals? It's me, German985. I hope you had a good stream, Neanderthals.
[3034.68s -> 3052.36s]  Maybe go the right way. Hold on. Apology raid? Why is there an apology raid? Apology raid? I hope
[3052.36s -> 3059.77s]  you had fun in whatever you're doing. Always... Always a welcome... Welcome presence, Neanderthals.
[3059.77s -> 3078.39s]  Sing the raid song. Uh-oh. This is like the part of the live concert where the singer, like,
[3078.39s -> 3083.77s]  is just waiting for the time to come in, and they kind of forget the fucking lyrics,
[3083.77s -> 3087.78s]  and the whole band is playing the intro, and the singer's just kind of dancing around.
[3092.87s -> 3094.07s]  It's like, come on, do it!
[3100.10s -> 3106.06s]  The singer goes over to the fucking guitarist and starts, like, hamming his head back and forth,
[3106.06s -> 3109.98s]  and the guy's just fucking doing a crazy riff, and he's just begging. He leans back and he
[3109.98s -> 3111.74s]  whispers, like, fucking, come on, man, this is killing me.
[3123.67s -> 3139.54s]  It's always... Where do I go? Where do I go? Where do I go? I don't know what to do. I'm so stupid.
[3140.66s -> 3155.08s]  Vault? I know, but I can't... I'm trying to grab this ledge over here.
[3155.80s -> 3160.34s]  Wouldn't this be the scenic route over here? I can't grab this ledge.
[3161.58s -> 3175.00s]  Viewers gone? Oh, whatever. I can't drop here. Look up. I shouldn't be able to... What the fuck?
[3178.52s -> 3197.50s]  What? Why can I not figure this out? So, I don't... Why can I not do this? Just keep going left?
[3197.50s -> 3203.21s]  I can't. Tell me about that, right? I would assume to climb that and grab that and shimmy.
[3204.01s -> 3226.44s]  Climb this and shimmy this way? Okay. He did it. Well, we got a raid came in, too. I'm sorry.
[3227.40s -> 3244.20s]  A raid came in. I had to sing the raid song. Oh, my God. That's horrible. Look at this zonked brain.
[3244.84s -> 3250.94s]  So, it's the raid's fault. I didn't say that. I just said I had to sing the raid song.
[3250.94s -> 3270.68s]  I can't save on the pole. All right. Scan it. Shit. I didn't get it. I want to save point right here.
[3277.21s -> 3283.70s]  Blend in. Okay. Server room is behind... We got a guy over there that can see through my disguise,
[3283.70s -> 3294.97s]  though. Do I have... We got two guys over here. We got toilet three. I don't have to do that.
[3297.62s -> 3306.06s]  Okay. Toilet in here. Turn on the sink and seal. No, I don't... What do I have for items? Oh,
[3306.06s -> 3314.06s]  I have a soda. What the... What's that? What's that? What's that green stuff? There's a camera
[3314.06s -> 3321.62s]  right there, isn't there? Does it matter if I get seen on the camera? Oh, shit. All right. Hold on.
[3326.55s -> 3337.86s]  What? Oh, shit. What? It was full? I thought it was an empty can. Are you serious? Okay. Well,
[3338.42s -> 3373.66s]  who's in here? Oh, all right. Hold on. I can... Where do I put him? He was thinking. Oh, janitor key.
[3373.66s -> 3378.84s]  So now I'm the janitor. All right. We're going to find that server room is not... This is not... Oh,
[3378.84s -> 3390.78s]  it's right here. Nice. Okay. Save it. Terminal is locked. Can he do it? Can he do anything about
[3390.78s -> 3397.86s]  this? Hmm.
[3404.82s -> 3415.35s]  Okay. Pull one of the racks. How about this one? Wait. This is sabotage on 1080. Let's go.
[3415.99s -> 3430.52s]  People hear this? Who hears this? Oh, thanks. Where am I supposed to hide? I can't even hide
[3430.52s -> 3467.40s]  in here. What? What? How do you not know? How does he not know? How did he not know? What?
[3467.40s -> 3528.63s]  What? Let me see how the gunplay is in this one. Where'd he go? Okay. I got to clean this
[3528.63s -> 3535.82s]  up a little. This is a little too much. Clean this up. Just dump them. Is there a party still
[3535.82s -> 3563.22s]  going on here? He's still falling? How far is that? How did he land? He landed right on the
[3563.22s -> 3574.01s]  crown of his head and stayed that way? Oh, I got the penthouse card. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh,
[3574.01s -> 3576.57s]  shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
[3576.57s -> 3594.57s]  Over here. Over here. Over here. Hey. I don't think I will. I don't think I will drop the scissors.
[3595.21s -> 3613.99s]  Oh, shit. My stomach. I just let him punch me in the face as hard as he could.
[3614.39s -> 3625.74s]  Oh, shit. I flinched a little too. Oh, my God. It's time to drop the scissors. Oh, that was
[3625.74s -> 3636.34s]  fucking funny. I love this game. All right. Let's go. I'm going to try. Okay. Let's pull this out.
[3636.34s -> 3660.74s]  Oh, get me out. Get me out. How do I hide? How am I supposed to hide? Fuck. There's no cabinet
[3660.74s -> 3732.70s]  or anything. Oh, I'm putting my hands up. No shit. They're gone. Oh, wait. Is this going to kill him?
[3747.91s -> 3766.23s]  What? Oh, my God. I can't be trusted. Just pull the server out. All right. I'm playing the game for
[3766.23s -> 3775.16s]  real now. I'm not. I'm playing the game for real. Let's go. Play the game for real. Leave the room.
[3777.40s -> 3780.78s]  I'm going to play the game for real. No more fucking around. I promise. I'm going to get to
[3780.78s -> 3785.10s]  the end of this. I'm going to get to the end of this mission. I promise. Yes. 47. Pull one of them.
[3785.10s -> 3785.74s]  And I'm going to run out.
[3794.38s -> 3798.46s]  A silent alarm has been tripped. Security is on its way. Hide 47.
[3834.02s -> 3846.97s]  Nice stormtrooper aim. Did he look in the toilet? You looked in the toilet. You looked in the toilet.
[3846.97s -> 3853.61s]  Like he could be in the toilet. I mean, they probably heard a ton of stories about this guy.
[3853.61s -> 3859.35s]  He can be anybody. He can be anything. He can be any object. They probably think I can be objects.
[3859.99s -> 3875.69s]  Okay. Am I good? He's down there. All right. Hold on. I got to get the penthouse key.
[3876.25s -> 3884.18s]  I got to get one of these guys in this room. Get out before they come. Wait, what?
[3884.90s -> 3912.78s]  Oh, get back in. Get back in. Get back in. Check the toilet again. Was it too late?
[3912.78s -> 3940.92s]  There's a guy. Who's that guy in there? Fuck. Did I? Yes. Sorry about that, 47. Let's try again,
[3940.92s -> 3948.97s]  shall we? I think I've got it. We'll need a key card to gain access. Someone in maintenance should
[3948.97s -> 3960.17s]  have one we can borrow first. I have one. Don't I have one? I don't have a card. I am maintenance.
[3964.86s -> 4005.37s]  I'm compromised though. I need to reload the safe. No, not yet. He doesn't hear this. Come here.
[4005.37s -> 4023.61s]  All right. We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good. Put him in here. Take his gun. Body
[4023.61s -> 4030.52s]  hidden. All right. I'm good. Let me take the gun. Does he have a card too or anything? All right.
[4030.52s -> 4041.69s]  We got the gun. How do you holster? Okay. H. Save it. All right. Into the maintenance room.
[4041.69s -> 4051.94s]  Get a maintenance key. Do not throw this guy off the edge. It was an insane idea to start with.
[4051.94s -> 4059.38s]  Come on. Exploding golf ball. I've never taken things to such an extreme before.
[4059.38s -> 4076.28s]  Let's see. I, but no, but I know I have it. Fuck this guy too. No, I need his key. I need his key.
[4077.16s -> 4094.84s]  Oh, I got it. All right. We're good. All right. The people down on the first floor right now
[4094.84s -> 4100.60s]  are probably just like, um, this is a really nice party, but people keep coming, keep falling from
[4100.60s -> 4105.08s]  second floor. I think that's something we should probably look into. That must have done something.
[4105.08s -> 4120.47s]  Can you see anything different in the room? Um, is it the letters? The letters lit up. R. O. A. D.
[4120.47s -> 4147.06s]  Road. It's the screens or the A. M. M. Row. Rome. More. M. O. A. R. More. O. M. A. R. Okay. We're
[4147.06s -> 4190.20s]  doing it in this order, right? Oh, I'm a guard too. Fuck it. I can keep going. I can't. Oh, A. M.
[4191.61s -> 4201.94s]  A. M. R. More. Look at the screens. Video feed. Downloading video feed. Monitoring server disabled.
[4201.94s -> 4220.87s]  Body. Monitoring server disabled. Did I do it? What about this screen? Open.
[4221.03s -> 4229.26s]  Reinforcements are incoming. More guards on their way. Look on top. Yeah. Is it the letters?
[4229.98s -> 4243.67s]  Central processing unit. Oh, do I have to spell somebody's name? M. O. A. R. More. Guards are on
[4243.67s -> 4263.51s]  their way. Spell Andy. A. N. D. Y. More guards. Get reload on that. Nice. Okay. Okay. There we are.
[4267.19s -> 4272.66s]  One of the screens. This screen is different. It's this one. It's this one. The screen is
[4272.66s -> 4291.98s]  different. It's this one. Pre-order the schedule. Oh, shit. Rearrange the meetings. Meeting time
[4291.98s -> 4304.73s]  updated. When? Oh, shit. Really? Wait. Turn all the cameras off too. Andy?
[4306.17s -> 4318.70s]  What? Open all the doors. And deposit emergency funds. What happened? A bunch of gold bars just
[4318.70s -> 4325.43s]  came out of that. What happened? Did I just make a frenzy at the first floor? All right. Wait. I gotta
[4325.43s -> 4345.86s]  go to the meeting. Save it. Save it. Save it. Save it. Okay. Go to the meeting. Shit. I gotta get in
[4345.86s -> 4359.61s]  there. Shit. Conference room. These guys see through my disguise. Oh, fuck. Okay. We're good.
[4359.61s -> 4374.15s]  You don't have to search me, right? Oh, thank God. Oh, my God. There he is. There he is. Get a
[4374.15s -> 4394.25s]  chainsaw and cut the tree down and drop the tree on his head. Save it here. Nice. Hey, I'm with him.
[4394.81s -> 4412.74s]  We're together. I'm his personal bodyguard. Martin, would you like an apple? I know you love the
[4412.74s -> 4420.86s]  golden delicious. I do too. We'll just wait for the partners to be alone. Then you can activate
[4420.86s -> 4427.02s]  the room's lockdown feature. I can? How do I? Wait, both of them are in the same room.
[4427.02s -> 4434.25s]  The partners are alone now. Activate the panel controlling the room. That doesn't matter. The
[4434.25s -> 4439.93s]  panel doesn't matter, dude. The panel doesn't matter. Use it to start the show. I don't care
[4439.93s -> 4444.49s]  about the panel. I just want to. No, no, no, no, no, no. I want to drop the chandelier on his head.
[4445.05s -> 4470.92s]  In any other way. Come on, hurry. How do I drop that? At this time in particular,
[4470.92s -> 4476.87s]  we need a solid foundation to rebuild from and someone to help us hit that traitor, Edward.
[4478.12s -> 4486.60s]  Shoot it? Oh, he'll get coming to him. You know, Marcus, my father taught me many things throughout
[4486.60s -> 4501.43s]  my life. Oh, what happened? Are you guys all right down there? Oh, this. This shaky building. New
[4501.43s -> 4517.83s]  construction. Brand new. Oh, quick. Play the piano before anybody figures it out. Carry on
[4517.83s -> 4553.06s]  with the meeting. I'll take care of the rest. Nice family guy joke. Wait. That's just at my mercy?
[4558.90s -> 4586.30s]  I can't just stand up from behind this vertical video. Really, Carl? You're making us look real
[4586.30s -> 4612.17s]  shitty here. Can't even save it. Zoom call. I kind of want to hit him with the apple and then let
[4612.17s -> 4626.46s]  him get up and go. He turned off the video. OK, right now, he threw the apple at him. Why did
[4626.46s -> 4639.03s]  you throw that apple at me? That was ridiculous. He's dead. Oh, I just skipped it. Does he fight
[4639.03s -> 4653.99s]  back? Hey, it's me, 47. You're trapped in here with me. I'll tell you what happened. He is dead.
[4658.87s -> 4673.80s]  Touch that. Oh, shit. He touched it. Get rid of the exit quick. Give me the exit.
[4682.18s -> 4691.43s]  I thought I locked it. I thought I had it locked down. Oh, Jesus. All it took was for him to kick
[4691.51s -> 4719.30s]  it and all the panels come back up. Tell me what to fucking do. Why did I do that?
[4720.98s -> 4757.85s]  Just go to the meeting already. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're so bad at
[4757.85s -> 4766.98s]  this. I just need to press buttons and throw things. All right, let's go. Agent 47 IQ.
[4771.83s -> 4783.11s]  You have a monkey brain. Yeah, I know. You guys know this. So I can do this cleanly by just
[4783.11s -> 4801.35s]  dropping the chandelier on them. Are they going to shimmy around? Fuck. Don't get spotted. How
[4801.35s -> 4809.38s]  you doing? There's a chef. There's a chef over here. Hold on. There's a chef over there, dude.
[4830.46s -> 4836.82s]  Inhale sharply and you're gonna lose consciousness because of your proximity
[4836.82s -> 4840.74s]  to me. There won't be enough oxygen within this square meter in order. I just want a bottle of
[4840.74s -> 4849.54s]  water. Who do you want to serve? Am I playing Skyrim? Why am I just taking everything in this
[4849.54s -> 4877.80s]  guy's room? Okay, I got what I wanted. Just keep calm. It's a busy day for surely we can get.
[4879.16s -> 4898.02s]  What's this? Do that. I certainly did. What's the meaning of this? You. You are the one
[4898.02s -> 4906.18s]  responsible for all this. And the layer meat on the chandelier meat on the chandelier.
[4909.35s -> 4924.84s]  Just wait. Wait, wait, wait. Drop the chandelier. But oh, do it now. What is this?
[4927.72s -> 4939.03s]  Model of the scepter. That's a meat. Shoot it. But I don't want to activate the. Won't they hear
[4939.03s -> 4945.82s]  this? What the fuck? No,
[4967.80s -> 4987.56s]  what do you mean reset? I disguised as him. It hasn't been noticed. Shoot the chandelier. Yeah,
[4987.64s -> 4991.66s]  I did. And it didn't do anything. It just like bounced off the metal. I wanted to hit him with
[4991.66s -> 5008.58s]  a bone too. Damn it. We meant the string. Yeah, I didn't know if it was the hit box would be on
[5008.58s -> 5015.86s]  the actual chandelier part too. Oh, let me drink some of that whiskey. Drop them behind the TV.
[5016.50s -> 5024.89s]  Okay, I have to get out of here. Will they see the blood on the ground? What if I turn that?
[5024.89s -> 5033.29s]  Wait, I didn't even get to use this. All right, I'll hold it. I can't save it. How do I get out of
[5033.29s -> 5094.74s]  here? I'm okay. No, just go. Oh shit. I'm close. Almost there. Nobody over here, right? Oh, I open
[5094.74s -> 5135.26s]  the elevator. That's right. Nice. Okay, cool. Did I go too far? Oh, I did it wrong floor.
[5135.26s -> 5155.26s]  This one here. Oh, it's right here. Wait, what? Wait, why is this right here? It's right here,
[5155.26s -> 5167.16s]  right? That's the button. You have to press the elevator button. The elevator is already open.
[5167.16s -> 5192.97s]  What? The elevator is open. I have to press the elevator button. Oh my god. He didn't even know.
[5192.97s -> 5208.39s]  How did you? It was you. Give me a break. I thought I just have to walk in. Really? I walked in there.
[5208.39s -> 5219.59s]  I had to hold G on the elevator button. I thought I was going to be just to walk in and it would be
[5219.59s -> 5234.62s]  like, oh, you did it with the cut scene. Yeah, that's my name. I've never played Fortnite even
[5234.62s -> 5256.10s]  for one minute. Not one single fucking minute. Nice. All right, that was fun. A new melee. A
[5256.10s -> 5273.99s]  hidden stash in the kitchen. A man behind the curtain. That's your winning face. I'd hate to
[5273.99s -> 5281.11s]  see you lose. We underestimated the constant. Now he's a glorified desk clerk. He's not just after
[5281.11s -> 5287.90s]  the money. He wants it all. Anyone's feeling they eventually keep her supplement is going to replace
[5287.90s -> 5297.24s]  him. Well, we're not the ones who let him escape. You still don't trust her. I don't like executive
[5297.24s -> 5308.20s]  decision makers. Look, you don't have to follow her. You know, soon this will be over. This is
[5308.20s -> 5312.92s]  2021 game. Maybe it's time to think about the future. Get out of here. You have to face the
[5312.92s -> 5319.88s]  possibility that what a way to ruin a cut scene. The ICA knows what you did. She'll make it right.
[5320.60s -> 5328.82s]  Oh my god, dude. Okay, that's the same exact thing. It just completely pulls you out.
[5329.46s -> 5334.26s]  We're at like a fast food restaurant and they have one of those digital menus and the Windows
[5334.26s -> 5341.29s]  update restart. Please continue thing is in the middle. It's just that's not supposed to be there.
[5341.29s -> 5348.94s]  You just completely remove me from my fast food environment. Okay, well, whatever. This is death
[5348.94s -> 5377.64s]  and the family. It's time to put the scissors down. I can't even. I keep thinking about that.
[5378.28s -> 5389.53s]  You tend to be reminded of what truly matters. So the end of the line. You ready for this?
[5391.00s -> 5400.50s]  Are you who will you be without a score to settle? I guess the world's most wanted fugitive
[5400.50s -> 5412.10s]  will have to do Alexa Christine Carly see Alexa Carlisle is dead. According to the funeral
[5412.10s -> 5417.54s]  invitation that is so naturally it caused quite a stir when the late matriarch turned up at the
[5417.54s -> 5423.30s]  breakfast table alive and kicking. So now we have to kill her. Why is that a number is up
[5423.38s -> 5427.38s]  has emerged from exile to tie up loose ends and secure the Carlisle legacy.
[5428.02s -> 5434.42s]  She may be a monster, but you have to admire her due diligence. Carlisle descends from an ancient
[5434.42s -> 5439.70s]  line of warrior aristocrats. Her great grandfather made a killing in the second opium war and
[5439.70s -> 5445.54s]  established an empire and shipping railroads and newspaper publishing while largely unknown to the
[5445.54s -> 5451.62s]  public. The family still asserts its quiet dominance over global transport and logistics, media and
[5451.62s -> 5459.54s]  technology. Most senior of the partners, Alexa Carlisle is cold as ice, tough as nails and sharp
[5459.54s -> 5465.22s]  as a razor. But an apple will do as always father who first brought the three families together
[5465.22s -> 5471.62s]  after the end of world war two at this very house. Meaning that this gentleman is the birthplace of
[5471.70s -> 5472.34s]  Providence.
[5473.62s -> 5480.18s]  Why is it on fire? It began here and it ends here. Manch, we're doing like a big mansion mission.
[5481.35s -> 5487.27s]  One more thing. According to our intel, Carlisle keeps a case file on the constant information that
[5487.27s -> 5492.47s]  may be helpful in his recapture. So eliminate the estate without it. Alexa Carlisle. Right.
[5493.51s -> 5496.71s]  Happy hunting 47. See you on the other side.
[5496.71s -> 5516.90s]  Hmm. Cool. Alexa Carlisle. Find the case file and eliminate Alexa Carlisle. Hmm. Okay. Hmm.
[5518.81s -> 5529.93s]  I want coins. Coins. Smuggled item. I want I don't have any unlocks. Classic outfit.
[5532.89s -> 5544.92s]  Oats. Yeah. Listen, I like that. I like the way it looks. Let's go. It's a spooky mansion.
[5546.10s -> 5555.66s]  Like the spooky mansion atmosphere. This looks fun. I like when they're self-contained in one
[5555.66s -> 5562.62s]  spot. Give me that fucking motorcycle please. The revenant Alexa Carlisle and her three adult
[5562.62s -> 5568.14s]  children. You skipped a mission. What? Grandson and daughter-in-law are all gathered to conduct
[5568.14s -> 5575.26s]  Carlisle's sham funeral. How? Curiously, Carlisle summoned a famous London PI soon after arriving
[5575.26s -> 5581.26s]  this morning. But his purpose at Thornbridge is yet unclear. Now, the target knows that you're
[5581.26s -> 5586.22s]  coming and her guard detail is top- Hmm. Cause she knows I'm on the way. So Mr. Gray will secure
[5586.22s -> 5592.22s]  their nearby field HQ and intercept all calls going in and out of the estate. Any appeal for
[5592.22s -> 5599.48s]  backup is going to fall on very deaf ears. Good luck, gentlemen. No. Give me that motorcycle.
[5600.36s -> 5623.08s]  Please. Please. Oh, no. Please. Oh, this is gorgeous. This is beautiful. This is really,
[5623.08s -> 5634.62s]  really pretty. All right. The PI. Is he going to come take a piss or something?
[5641.53s -> 5646.73s]  So disguises as Carlisle this morning. Take the car disguise and like walk through the gate
[5646.73s -> 5662.23s]  and just be like, interesting. Okay. A famous private investigator summoned by Alexa.
[5662.23s -> 5667.51s]  It's all the mystery. Has arrived at Thornbridge Manor. If you take his place, it may be an
[5667.51s -> 5675.06s]  opportunity to get close to Madam Carlisle. Okay. I like that. But, oh, okay. I'm going to go. I'm
[5675.06s -> 5689.27s]  going to get him. Excuse me. Excuse me. Uh, Tom. Tom. I'm such a huge fan of your work.
[5692.01s -> 5697.78s]  Oh, fuck. I'm trying to get. Oh, don't come. Don't come over here.
[5697.78s -> 5704.89s]  Don't come over. Where's my coin? I need a coin. Oh, come on, dude.
[5722.17s -> 5733.40s]  Just like, come on. Where? I didn't get a safe slot. Whatever. I can't walk across the water.
[5733.40s -> 5737.24s]  I can't like step into the little river. I can't. Why can I not walk in that?
[5737.96s -> 5746.17s]  It's an invisible wall. I can't walk in the water. What do you mean? Jesus. No, I'm talking about
[5746.17s -> 5749.94s]  dunking. I can't like dunk in here. I can't walk in here and dunk in this.
[5749.94s -> 5762.57s]  Why? All right. Let me get in front of him. All right. Two guards over there. Let me save that
[5762.57s -> 5779.18s]  right here. Check this out. What have we got? These guys over here. Famous. Yeah. I'm going to try
[5779.18s -> 5811.38s]  to get his autograph. He's famous. Okay. Save it right here. What just happened? You can see
[5811.38s -> 5838.98s]  me right now? Fuck. Hold on. I mean, you. Both of you should go. What the fuck? I can cross the
[5838.98s -> 5854.39s]  river? What? I tried to do that earlier. What the fuck? All right. The hedge guy. Hedge bushers.
[5854.39s -> 5868.62s]  The hedge trimmer. Come over here. You can see through the bushes? Just like scoop them up?
[5869.58s -> 5874.52s]  Oh, shit. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[5874.52s -> 5911.27s]  Is that guy going to see? Grab him. No. Oh, I'm fine. Maybe the hedges. Where are the trimmers?
[5911.83s -> 5917.50s]  Where are the trimmers? Where are they? He had hedge trimmers on him. Where are they?
[5917.50s -> 5923.66s]  No, I need to be you. I need to be you. I need to be you. I need to be you. I need to be that guy.
[5929.91s -> 5948.78s]  Nice work. I work here, though. Okay. That was very, very. Okay.
[5950.20s -> 5955.06s]  That was extreme change in. I guess we have a history.
[5960.06s -> 5965.58s]  But don't go in the window. It's right over here. Open. Complete fucking security hole.
[5974.68s -> 5985.35s]  What are you looking at? Who's looking at me? Shut the fuck up. Oh, my God. He saw.
[5987.35s -> 5991.62s]  Was it a butler? It was the butler. It was the butler. It was the butler. It was the butler.
[5991.62s -> 5995.62s]  It was the butler. We're good. We're good. We're fine. We're fine. We're fine. Oh, shit.
[5995.62s -> 6007.94s]  It was the mother of worker or something. I don't know. What? My computer's hard crashing.
[6007.94s -> 6011.54s]  My computer's hard. I think my computer's turning off. My computer's turning off.
[6019.90s -> 6030.81s]  What the hell happened? Everything just crashed. My computer did. What the fuck?
[6031.45s -> 6045.14s]  You ripped too big of a hole. Oh, okay. Let me restart it. I couldn't even see an indicator
[6045.14s -> 6053.03s]  on my screen. I have a thing where it shows my mic level. My mic level shows up, right?
[6055.58s -> 6069.05s]  That wasn't even visible anymore. Everything turned off. Okay. Well, let's try that again.
[6069.61s -> 6081.82s]  You are online. I don't want to be online. Sign up. Don't ever ask me again.
[6087.58s -> 6101.03s]  Death and family. Okay, let's go. Load game, right? Just load game. What the hell is load game?
[6114.38s -> 6124.62s]  Age up? Oh, okay. How far away was this? Oh, okay. Now it's right here. We're fine.
[6125.42s -> 6138.06s]  Oh, that was the lady. I thought that was another worker at the hotel or the mansion. I thought it
[6138.06s -> 6169.48s]  was a worker. Idiot. What does he have on him? What do you have on you? Anything? No. All right.
[6169.48s -> 6173.91s]  Where do I hide him? In that little closet? Somebody's going to see over here. What's in
[6173.91s -> 6188.68s]  here? Can I dump him in here? I'm going to dump you in here. Come here. Where can I put him?
[6188.68s -> 6201.16s]  Break open the... No, no, no. Where can I dump him? Does anybody come in here for any reason?
[6201.24s -> 6225.05s]  Whoa. All right. Well, window, window, window. No, not window. There's a guy right here. This
[6225.05s -> 6253.77s]  is the only guy. Won't he see? Okay. I think I'm all right. I can't walk around with a saber,
[6253.77s -> 6262.81s]  but I feel like if I was like a really esteemed private eye, I probably would. Can I just pretend
[6262.81s -> 6282.54s]  to be Indiana Jones or something? Meet Alex in the foyer. Oh, wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[6282.54s -> 6300.41s]  I'm here. Sure. Whatever you need, I can do it.
[6300.73s -> 6320.38s]  I am Mr. Fernsby the butler. Hello, Fernsby.
[6323.10s -> 6326.86s]  How are you? Mr. Whitmer, I understand that you've traveled to London.
[6326.86s -> 6365.38s]  Do I care? I am Mr. Fernsby the butler. Madam Carlisle has asked me to assist you in any way.
[6365.38s -> 6370.25s]  I could have just followed her up. I understand that you've traveled from London. Would you care
[6370.25s -> 6373.21s]  for some refreshments? I didn't have to listen to her. Would you prefer to go straight to Mr.
[6373.21s -> 6380.95s]  Zachary's sleeping quarters? Hmm. I would. I prefer to get started as you wish. If you'll
[6380.95s -> 6399.40s]  follow me, sir. Wait, like I was going up here anyways. I feel obliged to point out the current
[6399.40s -> 6404.18s]  affairs surrounding Madam Carlisle are of a delicate nature. Are these her kids?
[6404.18s -> 6409.21s]  You may be familiar with the recent announcement. Are these you? You'll probably learn that the
[6409.21s -> 6415.42s]  stage show is scheduled to take place tomorrow. Adam's children were not informed until this
[6415.42s -> 6423.05s]  morning at all. Wow. So please bear with them if they seem affected by the situation.
[6423.05s -> 6434.92s]  Are they in the house? Wences gets out of them. Consider her dead when I leave.
[6436.47s -> 6441.83s]  And I nudge him really fucking hard into his waist and I wink a shitload of times.
[6441.83s -> 6452.09s]  The case concerns the death of Mr. Zachary. He was found dead in his bed this morning.
[6452.09s -> 6457.21s]  Really? The door was locked from the inside and a suicide letter was found in his room.
[6458.73s -> 6465.18s]  Interesting. Madam Carlisle suspects Fowl did not accept that he took his own life.
[6465.18s -> 6468.78s]  Sure. I've prepared some information for you. I have to do some detective work. So please do come
[6468.78s -> 6473.98s]  and see me when you've finished your investigation of the crime scene. This is Mr. Zachary's room,
[6473.98s -> 6486.02s]  to my right. Okay. Holy shit, I was gonna say disappeared. A locked room murder mystery 47.
[6486.02s -> 6489.30s]  Hmm. I trust you'll get to the bottom of this. It's a murder mystery?
[6490.70s -> 6496.78s]  If it don't, I end up being the murderer at the end anyways. I'm the killer. Oh, what a twist.
[6496.78s -> 6503.62s]  Somebody in here. Why don't you use your camera to scan the dead body? Oh, this person's dead.
[6509.74s -> 6518.17s]  Tell me what happened to him. Throat markings indicate a rare short-lived spread shows time
[6518.17s -> 6525.91s]  of death at around this night. Do you know your poisons 47? Okay. We're looking for poison.
[6525.91s -> 6533.90s]  There it is right here. He must have drank out of that. Just check that for poison. Whiskey glass
[6533.90s -> 6539.22s]  and bottle found on Zachary Carlisle's bedside table. What else is down here?
[6541.83s -> 6547.90s]  Oh, there's a fresh fire. This is very recent. There's a fresh fire over here.
[6548.46s -> 6564.44s]  It's fresh wood. Computer. Yep. What was the last email he sent? Zachary was shopping for
[6564.44s -> 6570.60s]  new Wellingtons last night. Not exactly what you would expect from someone suicidal. Interesting.
[6570.60s -> 6585.50s]  Okay. Interesting. Very interesting. How much is his horn tabs? Who's this? Who's this person?
[6585.50s -> 6599.50s]  Are you supposed to be the one that's like guarding this guy all night? Who are you? What about out
[6599.50s -> 6605.08s]  here? A lot of booze. That's pretty much. Oh, that's pretty. That's really pretty.
[6605.80s -> 6621.46s]  Get me out of here before I do something stupid. What else is there? Oh, this looks like it
[6621.46s -> 6635.70s]  can be opened. Let me tell you guys something. Let me give you guys a little bit of advice.
[6636.58s -> 6646.31s]  If your Tinder profile is all this, delete them all now. Right now. Delete them all. You're going
[6646.31s -> 6657.43s]  to need a few different photos. This is a swipe. This is a swipe left. It just is. Set it up. Take
[6657.43s -> 6665.85s]  a photo. Take a selfie. The camera in the mirror is just. There's an immediate swipe left. I don't
[6665.85s -> 6669.45s]  have to tell you that. You should know that by now. Especially if it looks like this too.
[6679.18s -> 6701.03s]  You'd be a really bad wingman. Hold on. Wait. Wait. Let's get this right. Perfect. I don't even know
[6701.03s -> 6709.58s]  what the hell you look like. Bad wingman? That's a good tip. That's a good tip. That's a good tip.
[6709.58s -> 6722.52s]  Okay. What else we got? All right. Get this stupid filter up. Investigate the room. But what else is
[6722.52s -> 6730.42s]  there? The blood stains? Shoes. He was looking for those. Wait. Something hidden under here.
[6731.06s -> 6746.22s]  Anything else in this bed? Telephone. Can anything be interacted with? Wait.
[6746.22s -> 6761.40s]  We're at the computer again? Oh, there's a note here. Zachary's suicide note. It's a handwriting
[6761.40s -> 6766.33s]  sample. Suicide note found on Zachary Carlisle's bedroom. It reads, I am haunted by horrible past
[6766.33s -> 6771.37s]  choices and their all-consuming consequences. Alexa was the raft keeping me afloat. With that
[6771.37s -> 6788.23s]  I cannot go on. Goodbye. Oh, we see if it's a forged signature. Okay. I get it. Forged signature.
[6788.23s -> 6805.62s]  What else is in here? Does he have a pair of shoes in here? I don't see anything else to interact
[6805.62s -> 6831.11s]  with. A climb? Wait. There's a lemon over here. That's a kitchen knife. Is he my trolling? No.
[6831.67s -> 6847.40s]  What am I supposed to be looking for? Turn around. There's a big book over here. Bookshelf.
[6848.20s -> 6857.35s]  Go to the bookshelf. Bookshelf next to the ladder. Oh, the ladder was like blocking this.
[6858.15s -> 6870.81s]  It's a secret passage. This could explain how the door was locked from the inside.
[6870.81s -> 6889.22s]  Peep? Oh, this is... Can somebody see my eyeball? Let's just stop pretending. Okay, we got another
[6889.22s -> 6898.87s]  note. Floor plan. A photocopy of the floor plan. Floor plan of Thornbridge Manor detailing several
[6898.87s -> 6903.37s]  hidden rooms and passages. One which connects to Zachary Carlisle's bedroom. Somebody's been
[6903.37s -> 6908.65s]  researching the secret ins and outs of Thornbridge Manor. This is a two-way mirror. I believe you've
[6908.65s -> 6914.97s]  done a thorough search of the crime scene 47. Maybe it's time to see the butler. I'm curious
[6914.97s -> 6923.67s]  about the information he's prepared for you. Oh, close that. I want people to know I know what this
[6923.67s -> 6940.63s]  is. Mystery switch. Save it. All right. You got info. This is cool. A little investigation.
[6941.19s -> 6954.41s]  This is fun. All right. What do you got for me? I got some info for you. The signature was forged.
[6954.49s -> 6960.30s]  Mr. Furnsby? Hello there, sir. I'm done. I'm seen. Did you establish a time of death? Zachary died
[6960.30s -> 6967.14s]  around last night. Well, that means the staff were off duty and Carlisle and her security didn't arrive
[6967.14s -> 6973.46s]  until this morning. Hidden passages, though. Madam's family and myself as the only persons here when
[6973.46s -> 6982.66s]  he died. I don't have to bring you in? No, I do not have. Well, I was alone. Let's investigate that.
[6982.66s -> 6987.21s]  Here's the material that I prepared for you. It's a list of the possible... No, I was... I don't have that
[6987.21s -> 6994.01s]  out of my... I was in Zachary's bedroom murdering him with poison. Oh, don't... Oops, sorry.
[6998.47s -> 7007.21s]  This is very useful information, 47. Okay, very useful. Who's this? Gregory Carlisle,
[7008.20s -> 7012.28s]  the oldest child of Alexa Carlisle. Gregory is a suspect in the murder of Zachary Carlisle.
[7013.34s -> 7019.40s]  Rebecca Carlisle, the youngest child of Alexa Carlisle. Rebecca is a suspect. Emma Carlisle,
[7020.26s -> 7027.53s]  the wife of Gregory, Patrick, the son of Emma, and Mr. Fernsby. Butler at Thornbridge Manor,
[7027.53s -> 7038.17s]  Mr. Fernsby is a suspect in the murder of Zachary Carlisle. Hmm, okay. Suspects. Hmm.
[7044.81s -> 7060.38s]  Am I supposed to be killing the lady? This is cool. Wait, I hear somebody talking.
[7063.69s -> 7070.62s]  Okay, there's the son. Let's do it.
[7098.98s -> 7099.78s]  Okay, let's question him.
[7099.78s -> 7110.02s]  Kill this guy. Where were you yesterday evening?
[7116.46s -> 7116.78s]  Kill.
[7116.78s -> 7118.78s]  Kill.
[7128.12s -> 7129.00s]  Shit, I was trying to close all the doors.
[7134.36s -> 7148.33s]  Okay. The library is... Sure, but what happened? What do you think about Zachary?
[7151.51s -> 7155.35s]  Or do you think about shoes? Boots, specifically? Size 10.
[7170.09s -> 7170.65s]  Just kill them all.
[7170.65s -> 7181.43s]  Interesting.
[7185.75s -> 7200.23s]  Just kill all the suspects. Kill all the suspects. That's how you get it? That's brute
[7200.23s -> 7234.98s]  forcing. Patrick, it was me. Okay, bye. Who else is here? Targets. Am I allowed to go upstairs,
[7234.98s -> 7253.80s]  right? Why are you dressed as a bad guy from, like, wait, Mr. X? It is kind of Mr. X, isn't it?
[7256.01s -> 7262.71s]  Can I just go... Wait, hold on. Should I solve the mystery or should I just go in and shoot the lady
[7262.71s -> 7283.80s]  and then leave? Where are they? Are they underneath me? Where are they? I can hear them talking
[7283.80s -> 7295.72s]  through the wall. Solve it. Solve it. All right, I'll solve the puzzle. Let me see who actually did
[7295.72s -> 7303.03s]  the killing and then we're gonna get them all in a room and I'm just gonna just throw axes at them.
[7303.03s -> 7310.66s]  I don't know. You know what I do. You know how I do it. I'm the private... I'm the private
[7310.66s -> 7323.70s]  investigator. I can't... I can't go up here? Why not? Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god.
[7323.70s -> 7343.45s]  Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. No, no, no, no, no. Okay. Let me solve
[7343.45s -> 7349.06s]  the mystery. I gotta find... Where are the other people? Where are... I've questioned you. Questioned
[7349.06s -> 7355.59s]  you. You were, like, with a girl somewhere, right? All right, where are you? I'm looking for Emma.
[7355.59s -> 7364.62s]  This is a big ass house.
[7377.18s -> 7382.14s]  Where were both of you? Oh, wait, you're not... I thought you had kids.
[7382.70s -> 7392.46s]  Somebody in the garden? Is that a brick? Holy shit. Best item in the game, thank god.
[7393.10s -> 7407.64s]  I thought they were... I thought they were, like, the... I don't know. I thought they were the kids.
[7410.46s -> 7426.65s]  Like, her kids? The people that could be killers? Give somebody... Give somebody a brick massage.
[7426.65s -> 7440.12s]  What does that even mean? All right, I'm looking for more people to talk to.
[7440.12s -> 7451.54s]  Somebody else in the garden? I have to investigate. I can't just have things given to me.
[7470.47s -> 7470.97s]  Okay.
[7476.31s -> 7498.41s]  Ohhhh, the butler! So the butler and Rebecca have half of a key. That's good to know,
[7498.41s -> 7508.02s]  and that's how you get into the safe trophy room. Oo, hello there. Rebecca.
[7508.02s -> 7512.80s]  I see. What's your story?
[7530.88s -> 7531.38s]  Lye.
[7535.16s -> 7536.12s]  Lye, how would you know that?
[7538.64s -> 7540.64s]  He snuck away to hang out with a girl.
[7540.64s -> 7541.60s]  Lye, how would you know that?
[7550.80s -> 7551.30s]  Oh, nine?
[7551.30s -> 7552.40s]  That's- we're Pacific time.
[7553.72s -> 7555.04s]  10-12, did you talk to somebody at 12am?
[7556.92s -> 7558.76s]  All those- all those offices are closed. Lye.
[7558.84s -> 7561.53s]  She did act a bit strange.
[7561.93s -> 7569.74s]  You know, I bet she was making lists for changes needing to be done once she gets her hands on Thornbridge Manor.
[7570.30s -> 7573.67s]  Quite the shock she had when mother arrived during breakfast.
[7573.67s -> 7574.43s]  That's a lie too.
[7575.79s -> 7579.75s]  Tell me about Zachary. Did he act strange last night?
[7579.75s -> 7583.43s]  You know, now you mention it. He was a lot more chatty than usual.
[7583.43s -> 7583.93s]  Hmm.
[7584.23s -> 7588.23s]  He wanted to know about my connections in the publishing business.
[7588.23s -> 7588.73s]  Where'd you get these?
[7588.97s -> 7592.17s]  Apparently, a friend of his is writing a book.
[7592.17s -> 7593.17s]  Where'd you get those?
[7593.17s -> 7596.17s]  Which strikes me as very peculiar. I didn't think he had any friends.
[7596.17s -> 7597.57s]  Is that everything, Mr. Whitmer?
[7597.57s -> 7598.57s]  Where'd you get those?
[7598.57s -> 7599.57s]  I do have a lot to see to.
[7599.57s -> 7602.90s]  Where'd you get them?
[7602.90s -> 7604.90s]  Anything else you feel like mentioning?
[7604.90s -> 7612.90s]  I may be wrong, but I saw Mr. Fernsby, the butler, leave Zachary's room early this afternoon.
[7612.90s -> 7616.90s]  And he seemed a bit startled when he saw me in the hallway.
[7616.90s -> 7618.90s]  It's probably nothing.
[7618.90s -> 7619.90s]  Oh, and one more thing.
[7621.36s -> 7625.54s]  Please be kind to Edward. He can only take so much.
[7625.54s -> 7631.88s]  Keep your distance, sir.
[7631.88s -> 7634.05s]  Okay. Thank you for the help.
[7634.05s -> 7636.05s]  Now we know we need to talk to Edward.
[7636.05s -> 7647.40s]  I'm probably just going to get fed up that I'm trying to talk to people that I need to find.
[7647.40s -> 7649.40s]  And I'm going to not find one family member, and I'm just not going to care.
[7649.40s -> 7651.40s]  I'm just going to go up and shoot her in the head.
[7651.40s -> 7654.47s]  Ooh, a garden fork. Nice.
[7654.47s -> 7665.67s]  Alright, somebody else down here.
[7665.67s -> 7676.47s]  Revealing a mission?
[7676.47s -> 7680.37s]  What?
[7681.21s -> 7683.21s]  So, Madame Carlisle wants a picture taken.
[7683.21s -> 7689.21s]  If you were to assist with this refuse, I'm sure the portrait would be one for the audience.
[7689.21s -> 7691.71s]  Bring the whole family together?
[7691.71s -> 7695.36s]  And just explode the camera?
[7695.36s -> 7702.40s]  Oh, that's...
[7702.40s -> 7705.15s]  Shit.
[7705.15s -> 7708.48s]  Okay, hold on.
[7708.48s -> 7710.48s]  But I'm supposed to be investigating a murder right now.
[7710.48s -> 7715.98s]  Hold on. There's too many things to do.
[7715.98s -> 7719.76s]  Who's in here?
[7719.76s -> 7726.28s]  Solve the murder. I want to take a picture of people.
[7726.28s -> 7731.02s]  Believing his sister was dead.
[7731.86s -> 7735.86s]  I'd say worried about how things would be handled with Gregory and Emma taking over.
[7735.86s -> 7737.86s]  I said they'd let him stay here.
[7737.86s -> 7739.86s]  But Ethel was sure Emma would throw him out.
[7739.86s -> 7741.86s]  First chance she got.
[7741.86s -> 7743.86s]  And now we'll never know.
[7743.86s -> 7745.86s]  You're taking this hard, aren't you?
[7745.86s -> 7750.40s]  Okay.
[7750.40s -> 7752.96s]  Solve the murder.
[7752.96s -> 7754.96s]  I will solve the murder.
[7754.96s -> 7760.79s]  I'm going to solve the murder.
[7760.79s -> 7762.79s]  Can I at least kill the photographer?
[7762.79s -> 7765.78s]  You guys...
[7765.78s -> 7767.78s]  Holy shit.
[7772.44s -> 7779.10s]  Alright, where's the map? I want to see where people are.
[7779.10s -> 7782.11s]  I need...
[7782.11s -> 7786.72s]  What's this? Area undiscovered.
[7786.72s -> 7788.72s]  Alright, I'm going to go back in.
[7788.72s -> 7790.96s]  I have two or three more people to talk to.
[7790.96s -> 7794.52s]  Hey.
[7794.52s -> 7797.02s]  What's going on, bro?
[7808.38s -> 7812.16s]  I'm sure it is.
[7812.16s -> 7817.21s]  I want to question some more.
[7817.21s -> 7820.35s]  I questioned you.
