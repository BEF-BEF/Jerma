[1.66s -> 7.77s]  Oh, this is a disaster. I don't even have my lip balm. This is a disaster. Give me one second.
[7.77s -> 54.09s]  This is a disaster. One sec. This is like the weirdest tweet I think I've ever made.
[56.12s -> 65.91s]  Fucking weird tweet. You laugh, you lose in baby sensory videos today. I've come a long way from
[67.56s -> 82.09s]  I'm playing Spy on Upward today. What's going on here? Okay, my mic's in a weird place. I got
[82.09s -> 87.35s]  some new monitors and I'm in the process of making them, getting them set up in a good spot.
[87.99s -> 95.59s]  And I messed up where my microphone is. I can't even stream yet. I can't even stream today. I'm
[95.59s -> 107.34s]  gone. This is too much. This is too much for me. I'm gonna go. Okay, I gave you some updates on
[107.34s -> 111.10s]  some things because I think you deserve them. It's been four or five days since I've said hello to
[111.10s -> 120.87s]  you. An update on the New Year's Eve stuff. I, the, this dominations obviously have been closed for
[120.87s -> 125.75s]  about a week. Going through the process of eliminating a bunch of these
[125.75s -> 131.11s]  nominees has been ridiculous considering, if I'm accurate, I believe there were,
[132.23s -> 137.59s]  and this is going after going through a first pass through, right? So everybody nominates shit.
[137.59s -> 142.95s]  We do a first pass through of, okay, duplicates and stuff that just really doesn't belong there
[142.95s -> 147.50s]  in that category. It doesn't belong here. No, no, no, not this one. After the first pass through,
[147.50s -> 155.96s]  there's like, I think like 50 best noise nominees that are still there. So I, it's gonna, I have to,
[155.96s -> 164.73s]  I have to do a lot of reducing. If I can get it down to like 20, have I really, I don't,
[164.73s -> 177.37s]  have I made that many? I remember somebody said, what's your official comment on the egg stream?
[179.67s -> 185.11s]  I streamed myself eating like hard boiled eggs or something as an incentive of like dying in
[185.11s -> 187.91s]  Team Fortress. I don't know, it was like, it was like eight, it was like nine years ago.
[195.72s -> 213.98s]  Make a best noise, do it again. No, please hurry. Let me get some updates. Updates, updates, updates,
[213.98s -> 217.66s]  updates, updates. You peaked on the egg stream. Well, that's weird considering I think there were
[217.66s -> 224.92s]  like 40 people on that stream. Interesting that I thought I had a little bit, a little bit higher
[224.92s -> 234.66s]  view numbers than that now. Okay. So here's what we're going to do. What? I didn't even update you.
[234.66s -> 239.06s]  Okay. So I'm going to say something that might sound a little,
[240.34s -> 245.54s]  there might be some shocked faces here, but the nature of how many nominees have come in,
[246.26s -> 251.51s]  I'm not saying this yet. I have not said this yet. So don't quote me on this, but just like put it
[251.51s -> 260.79s]  in brackets and then quote it. I might not do it on New Year's Eve. We might be one of those like
[260.79s -> 265.03s]  January, like there for, there's a dead pixel on this monitor. I just got it.
[266.46s -> 279.22s]  What is it? I got a dead pixel right in front of me. It's just a green dot. Come on. Oh, that sucks.
[281.88s -> 292.25s]  That actually sucks. Maybe. I mean, okay. Come on. Really? I didn't see it. I didn't see it here
[292.25s -> 302.50s]  before. You mad about one pixel. Yeah. I mean, when you, when you spend the money on one of these
[302.50s -> 309.45s]  monitors, reset it. Sometimes dead pixels kind of just out of there. And then they,
[309.45s -> 317.26s]  they just kind of flicker out, right? That's annoying. All right. The monitor is a, I got a
[317.26s -> 324.25s]  predator. I don't know the company. I actually don't even remember the company's name. I don't
[324.25s -> 332.49s]  know. Is it a Zeus? Asus? I don't know. I don't know what, what, who made this Acer is an Acer
[332.49s -> 339.46s]  predator. And it's, I turned it on. It was pretty good, but whatever. We'll, we'll, I won't complain
[339.46s -> 349.88s]  about that right now. Asus. Yeah. No, they don't. I don't know. So, all right. So I don't know. I'm
[349.88s -> 353.32s]  not sure if I want to move it like a few days just to make sure we have everything good. I have not
[353.32s -> 357.32s]  said that yet. I might just do double time here in the next few days to make sure that that actually
[357.32s -> 364.12s]  happens. Cause there's also rumble too. So we'll see if I get it on New Year's Eve, but don't be
[364.12s -> 369.93s]  surprised if it's like two or three days into the new year. We'll see. I have not committed to that
[369.93s -> 376.55s]  yet. I'm going to try. I'm not canceling it. No, no way. So what we're doing today is something
[376.55s -> 383.10s]  I've been talking about for a long time. It is a, let me turn my light on. So this stream is going
[383.10s -> 389.24s]  to be a, you laugh, you lose. I've never done it before. There's been a list of meme videos and
[389.24s -> 393.88s]  there's a, there's a playlist that I'm about to watch. It's got like 200 videos on it or something.
[394.76s -> 401.72s]  And it's just memes and funny shit. And we'll see if it gets me. If I laugh, we have a few incentives
[404.06s -> 409.42s]  next summer. I do. I, I think I just read that completely wrong. My microphone's in the wrong
[409.42s -> 413.74s]  place. And there's a dead pixel on my monitor. This is too much for me. I think I'm done.
[414.78s -> 422.30s]  Okay. So eat an egg sandwich. No, no, no. Then I'm not doing like incentives where if I laugh three
[422.30s -> 430.78s]  times, I have to do a headstand and drink a glass of milk. No. I am, I am like the uncle on Christmas
[430.78s -> 437.59s]  that doesn't buy presents for anybody. He just shows up with cash. Here you go. Here you go.
[437.59s -> 445.14s]  And here you go. That's $50 for each of you. So here's what we're going to do. Uh,
[446.04s -> 452.12s]  I'm going to make a pool of money every time I laugh and it has to be an audible laugh. It can't
[452.12s -> 463.38s]  be, I know look smiling. You're the best uncle ever. Yeah. No smiling, no smirks, no like,
[466.46s -> 468.62s]  you know what I'm talking about? None of that. It has to be like,
[472.38s -> 478.50s]  that's what we're talking about. We could do, we could change these rules a little bit out when
[478.50s -> 481.78s]  we get closer. Cause I have, I get, I'm going to pause it. I get to pause it at least a few times.
[483.93s -> 488.26s]  I don't think, no belly laugh only. I don't think so. It doesn't have to be a belly laugh.
[488.26s -> 495.27s]  It just has to be very clearly. I have like, I'm like, I've laughed. I will accept, um,
[495.99s -> 502.28s]  like if my mouth opens and a bunch of air comes out and it's like, that counts.
[502.28s -> 509.91s]  Face cam. Well, of course I'm going to do a face cam. So, but after that, we're going to watch a
[509.91s -> 517.53s]  few baby sensory videos. Um, I have found some, I've got about like half dozen, I think or so.
[517.53s -> 522.31s]  They're all, they're all pretty long and I don't know how this can play out. They look
[522.31s -> 529.32s]  fucking really weird. I am also considering, uh, activating what I would call hard mode.
[530.60s -> 537.24s]  Um, for myself, I'm going to just kind of hang out for a little bit and hard mode might activate
[537.80s -> 544.36s]  and, uh, it'll be hard to do this. It's, I might activate hard mode.
[548.60s -> 551.72s]  Well, I will see. I don't know if I'm going to activate hard mode.
[553.13s -> 563.61s]  Difficulty difficulty. What the fuck? So I, let's switch it over here because
[563.61s -> 570.44s]  let's see what's going on now. I have it ready. I know the title and that this is a playlist.
[570.44s -> 575.32s]  So this is just going to go, by the way, for every time that I laugh or like the first,
[575.32s -> 579.85s]  we'll go with the first, maybe 30 minutes. I don't have like a brand necessarily a plan,
[580.41s -> 584.23s]  but we're going to have a pool of money. And every time I laugh,
[584.23s -> 591.35s]  a hundred dollars is going to get added to that pool. Once the pool has been filled
[591.35s -> 598.46s]  at the end of the stream, I'm going to decide what is going to happen with that money.
[601.98s -> 611.91s]  A hundred dollars every time I laugh. I've never, yes, I'm, I'm like copy,
[611.91s -> 615.19s]  copy cat Andy. All right. I've never done this before. It seemed like fun.
[615.99s -> 625.26s]  Yeah, there's this charity. There's yeah, I probably will. A majority of it will go to charity.
[625.98s -> 632.07s]  I have a few things that I've in mind, a few places in mind, so we'll figure it out.
[632.07s -> 639.80s]  But a hundred bucks gets added to that pool. So are you, are you ready? Am I? Well,
[639.80s -> 648.86s]  hold on. The better question is, am I ready? I, I don't know. We'll find out. And I know I might
[648.86s -> 651.82s]  look like, I might look like a little weird today because I have this like thing here.
[652.68s -> 657.77s]  I've got this light. Do I look like I'm looking like a low, but I've tried. You need to be able
[657.77s -> 666.90s]  to see my face today. I don't care how shitty it looks. It's like a candle lit stream. Yeah.
[666.90s -> 672.66s]  It's very warm. And you see me well, right? You need to be able to see my face because if I go
[672.66s -> 681.59s]  like, then you need to be able to pick it up. Is the cam too small? I don't want the cam to be
[681.59s -> 689.69s]  because we're about to put the playlist on. I think there's 200 videos in this playlist.
[689.69s -> 706.10s]  Well, I said charity pool, but we're just going to call it pool just for now. Pool. Okay. A hundred
[706.10s -> 714.04s]  bucks. If I, all right, can I get it out of my system right now? Like when, when does it start?
[714.04s -> 723.30s]  I do look fucking evil. He's high. I've not activated hard mode. Hard mode is not going
[723.30s -> 735.78s]  to activate as soon as I click play. Okay. What if I lose immediately? What happens? Oh, I had money.
[735.78s -> 740.12s]  Okay. What can you make an incentive where if you laugh, you kiss the camera?
[745.88s -> 754.26s]  That is so weird. That's so fucked up. All right. That's the first incentive. If I laugh,
[754.26s -> 762.46s]  I'll kiss the camera. You ready? Make sure you guys can, can you guys hear this? Don't spoil this.
[763.80s -> 769.05s]  It doesn't count yet. I haven't really started. Some of these might be loud. Just be aware of
[769.05s -> 786.14s]  that. I don't know. Okay. Here we go. Your wicked parasocial. What? I always tell people don't do
[786.14s -> 789.98s]  that because I'm just a fucking weirdo that you don't know on the internet. You don't know me.
[789.98s -> 801.18s]  You don't even like me in real life. I guarantee it. All right. Here we go. One, two, three.
[818.41s -> 823.26s]  Yeah. Holy shit. Wow.
[829.26s -> 831.42s]  Um, there's some Scottish people that kind of say
[831.42s -> 864.31s]  the
[864.31s -> 869.93s]  I wasn't expecting Vince McMahon to show up. I put a hundred dollars in here. Oh no, it's kiss the
[869.93s -> 888.41s]  camera. How do I do this without being weird? This is, I don't want to do this. I don't want
[888.41s -> 901.21s]  to do this. Oh no. No, I don't think so. I was weird, isn't it? Okay. How about this?
[904.41s -> 908.49s]  All right. I got it. I did it. I'm not doing that. Something like that again.
[908.49s -> 920.36s]  Oh, son of a bitch. Me, Austin. It was me all along, Austin.
[946.55s -> 953.62s]  That was cute.
[989.59s -> 991.51s]  I thought this was a baby sensory video. I was about to laugh.
[1011.88s -> 1041.56s]  Armand Christophe. Don't worry. We'll get him. Can I help you? We'll get him. What's he doing
[1041.56s -> 1067.24s]  over there? That was closer than it was besides the Austin one. Oh, I am not drunk. I am not
[1067.24s -> 1078.55s]  fucking drunk. Can you tell the time? Yes. I am not fucking drunk.
[1089.75s -> 1091.11s]  This one's very interesting.
[1095.03s -> 1113.40s]  I almost, I almost laughed at this because it was weird. Cover all 9,000 taste buds,
[1115.14s -> 1122.74s]  aerate it, warm it up, driving up that top note, that cream, pure vanilla,
[1123.70s -> 1133.91s]  sweeteners. That's a 10. I've seen this video a million times. I love it. Not this one in particular,
[1133.91s -> 1138.57s]  but
[1145.37s -> 1148.33s]  I ain't never seen no muzzles on there, but it might be good though. My dad didn't know
[1148.33s -> 1152.17s]  about it. I'm out of here to him all around and then I'm going to rub it smooth everywhere.
[1152.17s -> 1156.33s]  Mustard. Come on, man. I don't put no mustard. You need to put a little seed on that thing.
[1157.61s -> 1162.33s]  What? Man, come on. Get that pep off there. Come on. Somebody come get this, man. Come on,
[1162.81s -> 1168.01s]  come on. Get that pep off. That's just too much dog on pep. I don't really want to see this no more.
[1168.01s -> 1172.49s]  That's really all you look for brisket. Oh my God.
[1182.44s -> 1185.24s]  We're good. We're good. We're good.
[1185.24s -> 1210.52s]  Twitter stinks. I'm leaving.
[1212.12s -> 1218.09s]  That just scared the shit out of me. That was weird. We saw people in the streets ready to put
[1218.09s -> 1224.41s]  2018 in the rear view mirror and say hello to 2019. We also saw this dog with a banana.
[1224.41s -> 1228.81s]  A festive atmosphere in the heart of downtown Orlando is what it's all about.
[1229.77s -> 1233.99s]  From the skyline, would you like to try our new chicken tendie and french fry combo?
[1233.99s -> 1253.06s]  Hell no. Can I get a chicken tendie combo, please? That was so stupid.
[1255.46s -> 1262.34s]  What the fuck was that? That was just bizarre. Can I get a chicken tendie combo, please?
[1263.14s -> 1283.06s]  That was you working the drive-through. That was just weird. It was just like,
[1283.06s -> 1294.68s]  why would somebody ever do something like that? Are you sitting in front of a fireplace? All right,
[1294.68s -> 1309.88s]  let me add it. What do they even say? You have the angel filter on. Okay, that's $100.
[1310.44s -> 1320.98s]  I want to see this one again. Some of these I've seen. Some of these I've never seen before.
[1327.54s -> 1330.50s]  Hell no. Can I get a chicken tendie combo, please?
[1343.58s -> 1350.84s]  Okay, all right, all right, all right. Again? Does that count? That shouldn't count twice.
[1353.82s -> 1359.16s]  No, no, it doesn't count twice. We were paused. What the fuck? It counts? Should it actually count,
[1359.16s -> 1369.67s]  though? Oh, move the camera. Where should I move it? Either 200 or fine. Now it counts. All right.
[1369.67s -> 1381.13s]  Yeah, I can't. I'm usually, here's the thing, like, I'm usually pretty immune to most kind of like
[1381.13s -> 1389.53s]  memes, but sometimes they get me. I, sometimes they work. We're getting a lot of community subs.
[1392.07s -> 1397.78s]  Okay, here we go. Back to it. Holy fuck. I'm so sorry.
[1401.96s -> 1407.48s]  That's me. I was laughing at that. That was fucking disgusting. That doesn't count if I laugh at my
[1407.48s -> 1423.03s]  own stupid bullshit. No, I didn't laugh at this. That doesn't count, right? Did you guys hear that?
[1423.03s -> 1428.33s]  That was an audible disgusting burp and I did like the old man thing. All right,
[1428.33s -> 1435.69s]  stop. Stop making me fucking laugh. I'm not looking at chat anymore. You didn't hear it?
[1435.69s -> 1439.13s]  Okay, thank God. It was, thank God my noise gate didn't pick it up. All right.
[1453.58s -> 1462.70s]  It doesn't count. You're going to cheapen the real ones. Yeah. All right. So stays at 300.
[1462.70s -> 1470.63s]  I thought this was going to be really easy. Like the first 10 or 15 videos were just like,
[1470.63s -> 1479.38s]  ah, these are humors. You suck at this. This is why I don't do these. I'm such a fucking like,
[1479.38s -> 1484.02s]  I'm one of the weasels from Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Guys, I laugh when like my car gets
[1484.02s -> 1495.43s]  bumped in GTA. Do you think I'm going to laugh? It's going to be like fucking 50 grand. All right,
[1495.43s -> 1505.69s]  I'll add it. No more. I guarantee it for at least the next 10 videos. Guaranteed. One, two, three.
[1513.86s -> 1516.26s]  That was just, they just put a bunch of weird shit in the video.
[1524.98s -> 1530.74s]  Necromancy may be legal in Cyrodiil, but few will openly admit to practicing it now that
[1530.74s -> 1549.43s]  the Major's Guild has banned it. Farewell. Classic. Rest in peace. Forgot about that part.
[1550.07s -> 1553.91s]  Richie. What? I might be stuck in the bathroom. I don't care.
[1557.59s -> 1571.11s]  That was small. Yeah. Can I get a sausage and mushroom pizza? Hey, how you doing? Can I get a
[1571.11s -> 1578.55s]  sausage and mushroom pizza? How you doing? Can I get a sausage and mushroom pizza? How you doing?
[1578.55s -> 1594.74s]  Oh, my head.
[1615.83s -> 1635.61s]  I love this. Ship my pants. Right here. Ship my pants. You're kidding. You can ship your pants
[1635.61s -> 1640.89s]  right here. You hear that? I can ship my pants for free. Wow. I just may ship my pants. Yeah,
[1640.89s -> 1645.29s]  ship your pants. Billy, you can ship your pants too. I can't wait to ship my pants, dad. I just
[1645.29s -> 1651.69s]  ship my pants. It's legal. It's very convenient. Very convenient. I just ship my drawers. I just
[1651.69s -> 1656.33s]  ship my nighties. She's saying shit. I just shipped my pants. They're actually saying shit. If you can't
[1656.33s -> 1660.97s]  find what you're looking for in store, we'll find it at kmart.com right now and ship it to you for
[1660.97s -> 1670.73s]  free. What is it, citizen? If you've got to travel, by the nine divines, stay on the roads. It's the
[1670.73s -> 1680.90s]  digra, you see. By the nine divines. Assault. Assault. You elves are all the same. All flash
[1680.90s -> 1687.67s]  and no fear. Let me tell you, I gotta pause it. I tell you right now, all the Skyrim and Oblivion
[1687.67s -> 1693.10s]  memes don't do anything to me. Zero. Because I've only played those games with like Kermit the Frog
[1693.10s -> 1698.62s]  fucking mods and like Thomas the Tank Engine engine and shit and like huge monsters and stuff. It does
[1698.62s -> 1705.32s]  nothing to me. Because that by comparison is like nothing to like Kermit the Frog chasing you with
[1705.32s -> 1721.45s]  a fucking battle axe. I've never played those games normally. Ever. Oh. I found some wild blizzies.
[1727.22s -> 1736.47s]  Hi, my name is Carla Shaw. You can stop at five or six stores or just one. I don't need friends.
[1736.47s -> 1745.75s]  They disappoint me. Hi, I'm Todd Le Roux. You could stop at five or six stores or just one.
[1745.75s -> 1749.75s]  I feel like a deer in the headlights of love. I feel like I probably have a video like this.
[1750.55s -> 1758.97s]  Like I've like auditioned for things before. You could stop at five or six stores or just
[1758.97s -> 1766.65s]  one. You could stop at five or six stores or just one. I would kill it, by the way. Can I ask you
[1766.65s -> 1782.54s]  kind of a weird question? You could stop at five or six stores or just one. I am the queen of the
[1782.54s -> 1788.70s]  universe. The waves part. Cry it? And they engulf me and the water is warm. You think I'd do a better job?
[1791.30s -> 1796.17s]  Or just one. I can see the Statue of Liberty from here.
[1801.46s -> 1812.68s]  You could stop at five or six stores. This fucking guy. I swear to God. The only reason why I laughed at that
[1813.24s -> 1818.20s]  is because like I just like seeing like weirdly into the future. I'm seeing like a thousand years
[1818.20s -> 1825.02s]  into the future or whatever. That's way too long. That's like gonna be me. Like the movements and shit.
[1828.17s -> 1845.24s]  Reenact one. You're gonna undie. All right. You want me to try it? I have, okay. I can't stand up.
[1845.24s -> 1861.03s]  I'll do it right here. I have to stand up. All right. Well, I got like shorts on. Just fucking
[1861.03s -> 1865.59s]  relax. Hold on. I might, I gotta tie this. I have to like tie my little, I don't count.
[1869.94s -> 1884.26s]  I have like pajama shorts on. Okay. So it's, you could stop at five or six stores or just one
[1884.90s -> 1892.22s]  and then say like a weird Bible quote or something, right? Okay. Here we go. Turn off the room.
[1892.22s -> 1919.77s]  You could stop at, how do you do that? You could stop at five or, you could stop at five or six
[1919.77s -> 1930.28s]  different stores. Just one. That's what gets you to fucking roll. They know you got emotion.
[1947.32s -> 1959.38s]  I actually jumped. I'm so far away. I'm all the way back here. I went like, yeah. How loud was
[1959.38s -> 1966.52s]  that? Was that loud? It got me. It did. What did I do? You were coming for us. Was that really that
[1966.52s -> 1974.47s]  bad? That actually made me jump. You charged at us. I don't know. It was that bad. I think it was okay.
[1975.19s -> 1984.73s]  It was loud. It was loud. All right. All right. I'm not doing that ever again. Let's go.
[1988.68s -> 2000.90s]  You scared the shit out of me. I jumped. Oh, sorry. I scared you. Your, your jump was disjointed.
[2005.14s -> 2013.08s]  Let me see it. How was it really that loud? Hold on. Let me, let me, hold on. Let me watch it.
[2013.08s -> 2037.56s]  I can't hear it. You could stop it. Oh, here we go. Okay. You see it? Right. Wait, that's freaking me
[2037.56s -> 2079.30s]  out. You could stop at five or six different stores. Just one. Just one. Wild eyes. That's how
[2079.30s -> 2088.07s]  you scare the coyotes away. Yeah. That's like, there, there are like bears in your backyard.
[2089.70s -> 2103.27s]  There are animals in your backyard and you're like, hey, hey. All right. Let's go.
[2103.27s -> 2111.35s]  Just for just one. I can't stand it when she touches me. People say that time heals all wounds.
[2119.24s -> 2124.87s]  I love this song. I'm going to say something to you right now that I've never said to an
[2124.87s -> 2147.53s]  all loving soul in my life. No. Stand. Stand. And then there's Chunky. He's dead. That's my
[2147.53s -> 2159.70s]  favorite video on YouTube. Chunky's dead. He's dead. I sneezed. Oh, I'm not allowed to sneeze.
[2160.66s -> 2179.14s]  I love all these videos. Why are there so many captions?
[2182.97s -> 2202.76s]  Why are captions turned on? It counts. I laughed at both of them in a row.
[2203.32s -> 2212.26s]  The only reason why I laughed at the second one was because the captions were on the screen.
[2214.55s -> 2219.43s]  What happened here? It was just so alarming. Is that Daffy?
[2221.35s -> 2232.10s]  He's fucking dead. Like he's dead. That kills somebody. Look at his face. He's so fucked up.
[2232.10s -> 2248.97s]  He has a gun. I don't know. Something about that is just, I don't understand the second one, but it
[2248.97s -> 2257.38s]  was. Did you know we've come? You want to fight? Why? This is not going to make me laugh. I did it.
[2259.86s -> 2290.63s]  Yes. All right, sir. Good one, sir. Good one. He's got the package.
[2290.63s -> 2321.37s]  Bomb, sir. The bomb. Defusing. Defuse. Bomb site secure. Bomb site secure.
[2321.93s -> 2326.33s]  Ready for you to defuse the bomb. Bomb site secured. Bomb site under control.
[2326.33s -> 2338.33s]  Where's the bomb? Where's the bomb? Where's this, sir? The time is running out.
[2388.33s -> 2411.14s]  The title. What's this title, man? The title is Zoomer Humor. I can't help it. It's like I'm,
[2411.86s -> 2418.82s]  okay. Jeez. It's just, it's too much going on. Zoomer humor. I don't know. You know what it is?
[2418.82s -> 2424.60s]  It's the fact that there are just so many sound effects. And so it's so fast. Like that, like,
[2424.60s -> 2428.76s]  no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's just like your brain doesn't know what else
[2428.76s -> 2434.09s]  to do besides laugh because there's no other emotion that makes any sense at all. Nothing else
[2434.09s -> 2447.98s]  makes sense. It's just like all the different images. Okay, I feel like when you close your
[2447.98s -> 2451.83s]  eyes, right, when you're going to sleep, let me know if anybody else has this happen to them.
[2451.83s -> 2456.63s]  When you close your eyes and you're sleeping and you're just about to hit that place where you're,
[2456.63s -> 2464.49s]  all right, I've gone unconscious and I'm falling asleep. There's this moment where your mind just
[2464.49s -> 2472.25s]  kind of goes wherever it just races. You'll go to random places. You'll be sitting at a restaurant
[2472.25s -> 2477.21s]  opposite side like Obama, just sitting there and having a conversation. All of a sudden you'll
[2477.21s -> 2481.61s]  feel or hear like the wind will blow. The door will open and there is snow outside and I'm going
[2481.61s -> 2486.38s]  to go outside. There's snow out there. There's a hamster in the snow. Our minds do this weird
[2486.38s -> 2492.92s]  thing right before falling asleep. That's what this is. And having, and having it be in a conscious
[2492.92s -> 2500.73s]  state and seeing it rather than kind of feeling it while you're sleeping is just, I can't do it.
[2500.73s -> 2516.41s]  It's too much. Okay, so that was by far the biggest one for sure. I can't imagine if this is on hard
[2516.41s -> 2533.93s]  mode. All right, let me update this. The fact that like somebody made this like specifically
[2533.93s -> 2541.42s]  and they titled it this weird title. All right, you have to go back and do it again.
[2541.42s -> 2552.76s]  Where are we? Okay, here. I'm going to lose, I think it's going to, I'm going to fuck it up again.
[2553.40s -> 2563.18s]  Yeah, it's just surreal. It's just so, everything is so odd. Okay, I'm fine.
[2587.77s -> 2598.01s]  Okay, I got through it. That was cute. That was really cute. That wasn't even funny. It was cute.
[2614.52s -> 2616.20s]  See, you motherfuckers are going to think this is funny.
[2619.10s -> 2621.58s]  You may got the honey, but I got the sugar.
[2625.58s -> 2627.50s]  Croissant.
[2631.32s -> 2632.92s]  Beans.
[2636.92s -> 2641.72s]  Let's see. Cream and mushrooms. Bro, she might have made beans, but you forgot about the
[2642.60s -> 2651.62s]  macaroni and cheese. What do you want? Creamy Italian cheddar cheese.
[2653.30s -> 2656.02s]  Well, you may have the cheddar cheese, but I've got
[2671.29s -> 2720.38s]  Oh, so it's just scary. What are you eating? I miss my wife tails. I miss her a lot. I'll be back.
[2723.02s -> 2746.14s]  I was doing this. Oh, it's on 720p. This is adorable. This is so cute. I just like this
[2746.14s -> 2762.46s]  little hamster. Hey, does anybody want coffee? Who wants coffee? I've seen this guy. Anybody
[2762.86s -> 2772.22s]  want coffee? Who wants coffee? Do you want coffee? I just made coffee. Do
[2772.22s -> 2779.74s]  anybody want coffee? Who want coffee? I just make coffee. Who wants coffee?
[2779.74s -> 2781.74s]  Anybody want coffee?
[2781.74s -> 2783.74s]  Who wants coffee?
[2783.74s -> 2785.74s]  Does anybody want coffee?
[2785.74s -> 2787.74s]  Does anybody want coffee?
[2787.74s -> 2789.74s]  Who wants coffee?
[2789.74s -> 2791.74s]  Does anybody want coffee?
[2791.74s -> 2793.74s]  Do you want coffee?
[2793.74s -> 2795.74s]  Who wants coffee?
[2795.74s -> 2802.58s]  Does anybody want coffee?
[2802.58s -> 2819.53s]  Is it that bad?
[2819.53s -> 2828.49s]  Oh, that was close.
[2828.49s -> 2830.49s]  Howdy, y'all. This here's Mike.
[2830.49s -> 2833.43s]  Down at Mike's Golf.
[2833.43s -> 2839.00s]  Ugh.
[2839.00s -> 2841.50s]  It was just the transition between these two.
[2841.50s -> 2844.44s]  It was the howdy.
[2844.44s -> 2852.63s]  It just goes from XQC
[2852.63s -> 2854.63s]  blowing out his microphone
[2854.63s -> 2856.63s]  to howdy. I don't know.
[2856.63s -> 2858.63s]  It was like the transition here.
[2858.63s -> 2871.86s]  Whatever.
[2871.86s -> 2876.02s]  Howdy, y'all. This here's Mike. Down at Mike's Golf.
[2876.02s -> 2878.02s]  Are the capsules supposed to be on?
[2878.02s -> 2880.58s]  Where we buy golf. That's right.
[2880.58s -> 2882.58s]  We buy golf clubs.
[2882.58s -> 2884.58s]  Mike's Golf Shop.
[2884.58s -> 2887.34s]  Come on over here. We buy
[2887.34s -> 2889.34s]  golf clubs.
[2889.34s -> 2892.47s]  Over at Mike's Golf Shop.
[2892.47s -> 2894.47s]  Come on down here. We buy golf
[2894.47s -> 2896.47s]  clubs. That's right.
[2896.47s -> 2898.47s]  We buy golf clubs.
[2898.47s -> 2900.47s]  We buy golf clubs.
[2900.47s -> 2902.47s]  We buy golf
[2902.47s -> 2904.47s]  clubs. We buy
[2904.47s -> 2906.47s]  golf clubs.
[2906.47s -> 2908.47s]  We buy golf clubs.
[2908.47s -> 2910.97s]  That muffin is looking awfully
[2910.97s -> 2912.97s]  like a hamster. Someone
[2912.97s -> 2914.97s]  baked a hamster into my
[2914.97s -> 2925.64s]  muffin. What is that?
[2925.64s -> 2930.44s]  He's not going to turn and eat the frog, right?
[2930.44s -> 2966.26s]  Oh! Oh!
[2966.26s -> 2980.98s]  I'm safe on this one, I think.
[2980.98s -> 2985.53s]  I like these movements, though.
[2985.53s -> 3003.13s]  It's loud. It's very loud.
[3003.13s -> 3008.25s]  That was just scary.
[3008.25s -> 3014.76s]  That was scary.
[3014.76s -> 3016.76s]  Freezing my nuts off.
[3016.76s -> 3018.76s]  Freezing my nuts off.
[3018.76s -> 3020.76s]  Freezing my nuts off.
[3020.76s -> 3022.76s]  Freezing my nuts off.
[3022.76s -> 3024.76s]  Perfect. Thank you.
[3024.76s -> 3026.76s]  Brahma. Freezing my nuts off.
[3026.76s -> 3028.76s]  That's just cute.
[3032.76s -> 3034.76s]  No, not this one.
[3044.76s -> 3046.76s]  Not this one.
[3075.70s -> 3077.70s]  I forgot about this video.
[3077.70s -> 3080.58s]  I forgot about this video.
[3080.58s -> 3082.58s]  I forgot about this video.
[3082.58s -> 3084.58s]  I forgot about this video.
[3084.58s -> 3090.79s]  I forgot about this video.
[3090.79s -> 3092.79s]  Why would they do that?
[3092.79s -> 3096.50s]  Aren't bits of sweaty? What are you talking about?
[3096.50s -> 3098.68s]  You're laughing.
[3098.68s -> 3100.68s]  It's fucking crazy.
[3100.68s -> 3102.68s]  It's just so stupid.
[3102.68s -> 3107.93s]  It's the fact that
[3107.93s -> 3109.93s]  Oh, look, I'm sitting there, funny picture of me
[3109.93s -> 3111.93s]  with a cap on or whatever, and it's
[3111.93s -> 3116.47s]  just like this car.
[3116.47s -> 3119.80s]  Alright, whatever.
[3119.80s -> 3121.80s]  I haven't seen this video in a long time.
[3121.80s -> 3123.80s]  That's how I knew I was fucking screwed.
[3123.80s -> 3127.82s]  It's always...
[3127.82s -> 3133.45s]  Okay, I have to start it over.
[3133.45s -> 3138.50s]  We got a thousand bucks in the pool right now.
[3138.50s -> 3141.13s]  It's just this
[3141.13s -> 3143.13s]  photo...
[3143.13s -> 3145.13s]  Whatever. You know, I don't have to say it again.
[3145.13s -> 3147.13s]  I fail. Let's go.
[3147.13s -> 3149.37s]  I'm gonna get
[3149.37s -> 3151.37s]  fucking locked here.
[3158.17s -> 3160.17s]  I have to get over it.
[3160.17s -> 3162.17s]  It's the... You've done a lot together.
[3162.17s -> 3164.17s]  It's just... I can't...
[3164.17s -> 3166.17s]  It's... Fuck.
[3166.17s -> 3168.17s]  This is bad.
[3168.17s -> 3170.17s]  Once I get stuck, I get stuck for a while.
[3170.17s -> 3179.19s]  Okay. You're insane.
[3179.19s -> 3181.19s]  You're gonna get stun locked here.
[3181.19s -> 3183.19s]  I'm gonna try... Okay.
[3183.19s -> 3190.04s]  Why are you laughing? It's fucking crazy.
[3190.04s -> 3192.28s]  I'm gonna try...
[3192.28s -> 3201.18s]  I'm gonna try...
[3201.18s -> 3204.57s]  I'm gonna try...
[3204.57s -> 3206.57s]  I'm gonna try...
[3206.57s -> 3208.57s]  Why are you laughing? It's fucking crazy.
[3208.57s -> 3210.57s]  It's so stupid.
[3241.37s -> 3246.36s]  No!
[3246.36s -> 3249.30s]  If any of the videos...
[3249.30s -> 3251.67s]  I have to... I need to take a minute.
[3251.67s -> 3258.01s]  I can't... You can't skip it.
[3258.01s -> 3264.09s]  That's not how this works.
[3264.09s -> 3266.09s]  We're at $1,200 now.
[3266.09s -> 3268.09s]  I'm gonna get through this one. I'm gonna get through it.
[3268.09s -> 3270.09s]  I just have to hide. Everybody relax.
[3278.92s -> 3280.92s]  It's the music, too.
[3280.92s -> 3282.92s]  The music is so... And this photo in the very beginning.
[3311.90s -> 3313.90s]  No!
[3313.90s -> 3315.90s]  I can't. I'm sorry.
[3315.90s -> 3317.90s]  Okay. Skip it for $500?
[3317.90s -> 3319.90s]  No. I can get it.
[3319.90s -> 3322.14s]  I swear to God, I can get it.
[3322.14s -> 3327.56s]  It's a... Oh, remember this?
[3327.56s -> 3340.86s]  Like, we just remembered it.
[3340.86s -> 3342.86s]  You don't make us remember this again. It's horrible.
[3342.86s -> 3347.53s]  I don't want to remember this. I don't even want to think of this again.
[3347.53s -> 3349.53s]  Alright. Last try.
[3349.53s -> 3351.53s]  And then I'm skipping it for $100.
[3351.53s -> 3353.53s]  Okay.
[3353.53s -> 3355.53s]  Okay.
[3355.53s -> 3358.47s]  Okay.
[3358.47s -> 3362.50s]  Try. And then I'm skipping it for $100.
[3362.50s -> 3364.50s]  I'm gonna get through it this time. I have to have seen it enough time.
[3364.50s -> 3369.18s]  God damn it.
[3369.18s -> 3373.53s]  I remember this video, too.
[3373.53s -> 3376.98s]  And I have just spent so long.
[3376.98s -> 3379.67s]  Okay. This is it. This is the one.
[3379.67s -> 3382.87s]  Thank you for watching!
[3415.83s -> 3417.83s]  Thank you for watching!
[3417.83s -> 3419.83s]  Thank you for watching!

[3442.18s -> 3444.18s]  Thank you for watching!
[3444.18s -> 3446.18s]  Thank you for watching!
[3447.18s -> 3449.18s]  Get it off! Turn it off! Turn it off! I've done it too many times.
[3449.18s -> 3452.64s]  Oh my god, my head hurts.
[3452.64s -> 3455.01s]  I'm good. Uh, let's do Ocarina of Time.
[3455.01s -> 3457.87s]  Ocarina of Time.
[3458.87s -> 3465.45s]  Hello. Two tickets, please.
[3465.45s -> 3467.45s]  For what? Moving.
[3467.45s -> 3470.71s]  Hey, Tony, what's going on?
[3470.71s -> 3473.85s]  Tony, what the fuck is this?
[3473.85s -> 3476.15s]  What the fuck? Tony!
[3476.15s -> 3478.15s]  Tony, what the fuck is this, Tony?
[3478.15s -> 3480.15s]  Tony, I did what I thought was best for the family, motherfucker!
[3480.15s -> 3482.15s]  You gotta believe me, Tony!
[3482.15s -> 3484.15s]  Please don't shoot the fucking gun, Tony!
[3484.15s -> 3486.15s]  Oh my god!
[3486.15s -> 3488.15s]  This is cute.
[3515.75s -> 3517.75s]  Not even real.
[3517.75s -> 3520.57s]  This one's a piece of cake.
[3520.57s -> 3524.41s]  Not even real.
[3524.41s -> 3537.06s]  You motherfuckers.
[3537.06s -> 3539.06s]  Turn camera!
[3539.06s -> 3541.82s]  102, take one.
[3541.82s -> 3547.96s]  With overlap. Action, please.
[3547.96s -> 3549.96s]  I'm gonna get locked on this one too.
[3549.96s -> 3552.46s]  Action, awesome, please.
[3552.46s -> 3554.46s]  It doesn't do anything?
[3554.46s -> 3557.08s]  No, sorry, cut.
[3557.08s -> 3560.09s]  102, take two.
[3560.09s -> 3566.09s]  Ah, the French Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[3566.09s -> 3570.09s]  There is a California Champagne by Paul Masson.
[3570.09s -> 3572.09s]  So drunk.
[3572.09s -> 3576.09s]  Inspired by that same French excellence.
[3576.09s -> 3580.09s]  It's fermented in the bottle and like the best French Champagne.
[3580.09s -> 3582.09s]  It's vintage dated.
[3582.09s -> 3584.09s]  Cut.
[3584.09s -> 3586.09s]  So Paul Masson.
[3586.09s -> 3588.09s]  102, take three.
[3588.09s -> 3590.09s]  I think I'm gonna be alright.
[3590.09s -> 3592.09s]  Action, please.
[3592.09s -> 3596.09s]  Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[3596.09s -> 3600.09s]  There is a California Champagne by Paul Masson.
[3600.09s -> 3604.52s]  Inspired by that same French excellence.
[3604.52s -> 3608.52s]  It's fermented in the bottle and like the best French Champagne.
[3608.52s -> 3610.52s]  It's vintage dated.
[3610.52s -> 3612.52s]  So Paul Masson.
[3612.52s -> 3614.52s]  Alright, we're good.
[3614.52s -> 3616.52s]  We're good, we're good, we're good.
[3616.52s -> 3620.52s]  Orson Welles right there is as drunk as you are.
[3620.52s -> 3622.52s]  As you are.
[3622.52s -> 3626.52s]  When you get to that point where you have to put your phone up like this.
[3626.52s -> 3633.13s]  And hold one eye open to like see if the lift driver is there.
[3633.13s -> 3639.66s]  Not fun.
[3639.66s -> 3641.66s]  I love this video.
[3641.66s -> 3644.09s]  I'm not even gonna laugh at this.
[3644.09s -> 3648.18s]  This video is just a good video.
[3648.18s -> 3650.81s]  Let me move some of this stuff out of the way.
[3650.81s -> 3662.36s]  This is a great video.
[3662.36s -> 3664.60s]  I don't think I'm gonna laugh.
[3664.60s -> 3667.67s]  La la la la la.
[3667.67s -> 3669.67s]  La la la la la.
[3669.67s -> 3671.67s]  La la la la la.
[3671.67s -> 3673.67s]  La la.
[3673.67s -> 3676.41s]  La la la.
[3676.41s -> 3678.84s]  La la la la.
[3678.84s -> 3681.66s]  La la la.
[3681.66s -> 3684.92s]  La la.
[3684.92s -> 3686.92s]  It's so weird.
[3686.92s -> 3688.92s]  La la.
[3688.92s -> 3691.16s]  La la.
[3691.16s -> 3693.16s]  Alright, I'm gonna freak people out.
[3693.16s -> 3695.16s]  La la la la la.
[3695.16s -> 3697.16s]  La la la la la.
[3697.16s -> 3699.16s]  La la.
[3699.16s -> 3701.16s]  La la.
[3701.16s -> 3703.16s]  Trump dog?
[3703.16s -> 3705.16s]  La la la la la.
[3705.16s -> 3707.16s]  I played this on stream already.
[3707.16s -> 3709.53s]  La la la la la.
[3709.53s -> 3711.77s]  La la.
[3711.77s -> 3714.07s]  If that was you on the phone and you on the bus.
[3714.07s -> 3718.31s]  Then who was flickering the lights?
[3718.31s -> 3722.73s]  It's me Austin!
[3722.73s -> 3724.73s]  Oh son of a bitch!
[3724.73s -> 3732.66s]  You already got me with that one.
[3732.66s -> 3775.10s]  Oh god!
[3775.10s -> 3778.74s]  Why did you come by train today?
[3781.37s -> 3783.61s]  Very excited about my new fridge.
[3783.61s -> 3787.00s]  Look.
[3787.00s -> 3789.00s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[3789.00s -> 3793.10s]  Where's the water?
[3793.10s -> 3797.00s]  That just sucks. What happened?
[3797.00s -> 3801.61s]  Fuck.
[3801.61s -> 3805.96s]  I'm staying up extra late tonight
[3805.96s -> 3807.96s]  to see a test train pull into Brighton station.
[3807.96s -> 3809.96s]  One of my favorite locomotives
[3809.96s -> 3811.96s]  might be on it so we'll just have to wait and see.
[3813.96s -> 3815.96s]  There's 73962!
[3815.96s -> 3817.96s]  Oh it's it!
[3817.96s -> 3819.96s]  It's it!
[3819.96s -> 3823.03s]  Oh quick, I've got to get around.
[3823.03s -> 3825.03s]  I've got to get around to see it.
[3827.03s -> 3829.03s]  This is beautiful 73962.
[3829.03s -> 3831.03s]  Dick my butt.
[3831.03s -> 3833.03s]  What?
[3833.03s -> 3835.03s]  What a beautiful locomotive she is.
[3835.03s -> 3837.03s]  Check out all the gear in there.
[3837.03s -> 3839.03s]  That's not real!
[3839.03s -> 3841.98s]  Marvelous loco.
[3841.98s -> 3843.98s]  I'm glad I stayed up late for this.
[3843.98s -> 3845.98s]  This is a treat.
[3849.88s -> 3851.88s]  That's a real train?
[3873.94s -> 3875.94s]  In the beaning.
[3875.94s -> 3879.00s]  In the in
[3879.00s -> 3881.00s]  the beaming.
[3881.00s -> 3883.75s]  Yeah.
[3888.17s -> 3890.17s]  Listen properly.
[3890.17s -> 3892.17s]  In the beaming.
[3892.17s -> 3894.17s]  Yeah.
[3894.17s -> 3896.60s]  In the beaming.
[3896.60s -> 3898.97s]  The beaming.
[3898.97s -> 3901.46s]  I n.
[3901.46s -> 3907.20s]  In- in the be- in the beeninging. In the beeninging.
[3907.20s -> 3910.52s]  Three, two, one.
[3910.52s -> 3915.65s]  Fast, sharp right. Fast, sharp right. Sharp right.
[3915.65s -> 3949.43s]  Sammy, fall, Sammy, please. Medium left, watching out the-
[3949.43s -> 3953.78s]  Sammy, you have to stay on the road, Sammy. Otherwise-
[3953.78s -> 3965.92s]  Sammy, you're gonna break the car.
[3965.92s -> 3970.67s]  Can you just imagine, like, somebody sitting behind Donkey Kong just yelling all this shit to him?
[3970.67s -> 3980.27s]  Ugh. You need to stay- when they go up and they do the gliding-
[3980.27s -> 3982.27s]  Holy shit, I'm sweating my ass off!
[3983.03s -> 3986.53s]  Ugh. It's always cars, I know!
[3986.53s -> 3993.71s]  Something about vehicles, just cars, I don't know why, they're just so-
[3993.71s -> 3999.13s]  Something about it just does it to me. I don't get it.
[3999.13s -> 4007.06s]  1400. It's alright. I don't- it's just like the way he's turning and it-
[4007.06s -> 4012.97s]  The car's bump- you don't even go- that doesn't even happen to you in Mario Kart.
[4012.97s -> 4016.21s]  Okay. You're admitting it. I'm just finding out what I think is-
[4016.21s -> 4020.77s]  Is it just big, bulky machines that we just drive around?
[4020.77s -> 4024.65s]  It's so weird that we do this in the first place.
[4024.65s -> 4027.65s]  Don't you guys think it's just bizarre that we drive around in cars anyways?
[4027.65s -> 4029.82s]  Like, it's such a weird object.
[4029.82s -> 4033.82s]  We have this machine that we all just sit in and it just goes fast.
[4033.82s -> 4041.42s]  It's just like a- what a fucking weird device.
[4041.42s -> 4045.06s]  Okay. Let's update it.
[4045.06s -> 4047.43s]  And- alright, I'm gonna try this one again.
[4047.43s -> 4055.39s]  He's got the notepad to- ugh.
[4055.39s -> 4058.27s]  I'm gonna try this one more time. I think I can get through it.
[4058.27s -> 4062.27s]  It was just this part here when he's yelling at him to stay on the road because they're flying.
[4062.27s -> 4069.47s]  Here we go! Do hard mode? Maybe. Let's go.
[4070.47s -> 4074.36s]  You didn't laugh at the train.
[4074.36s -> 4076.36s]  That was more unusual to me than funny.
[4076.36s -> 4078.82s]  Go.
[4111.60s -> 4113.60s]  Shut up, too.
[4141.49s -> 4146.25s]  I'm good. I'm good. That was rough.
[4151.84s -> 4155.84s]  What do you mean? They're for everybody but only for you?
[4155.84s -> 4157.84s]  Granny, they're dog treats.
[4157.84s -> 4159.84s]  No! No!
[4159.84s -> 4163.04s]  Oh, that was close. Just her- they only-
[4163.04s -> 4166.04s]  Squish that cat. All you need to know is to squish that cat.
[4166.04s -> 4168.04s]  And you just gently squish them.
[4168.04s -> 4171.04s]  That's not comfortable for the cat or that's safe to be honest with you.
[4171.04s -> 4174.04s]  You can just throw a towel on the cat again, squish her with a towel.
[4174.04s -> 4177.04s]  What you can do is scoop her up, a little football carry, just like that.
[4177.04s -> 4179.04s]  Butt in your hand and just squish her tight to your body.
[4179.04s -> 4181.04s]  Just squish him really tight to your body.
[4181.04s -> 4183.04s]  You don't have to worry about hurting a cat.
[4183.04s -> 4185.04s]  Just squish him against your body.
[4185.04s -> 4187.04s]  And there we go. We just made friends with this wonderful little cat.
[4187.04s -> 4189.04s]  Look at that face.
[4189.04s -> 4191.04s]  Squishing is your best friend when you're dealing with a cat.
[4191.04s -> 4194.04s]  You basically just lean forward, squish him nice and tight.
[4194.04s -> 4196.04s]  And again, I'm just squishing them into myself.
[4196.04s -> 4198.04s]  We always squish that cat.
[4198.04s -> 4201.60s]  I'm just confused by that one. Squish?
[4207.02s -> 4264.41s]  Why do I feel like this is an edited video from like four different scenes of this movie but it's not?
[4267.41s -> 4292.86s]  The end. The scream at the end.
[4292.86s -> 4298.06s]  I've seen so many of those breathing videos but it doesn't matter.
[4298.06s -> 4304.90s]  I think I just missed one.
[4304.90s -> 4316.22s]  How much longer? I don't know. I don't want to look.
[4316.22s -> 4327.11s]  Macho Man Randy Savage had some classic breathing videos too.
[4327.11s -> 4329.35s]  Alright, let me add it.
[4329.35s -> 4333.91s]  I feel like I don't have to watch that one again because I got to the very end and I laughed after the video ended.
[4333.91s -> 4339.42s]  30k viewers, what's up?
[4339.42s -> 4343.59s]  Welcome to the stream. This is a You Laugh You Lose slash Baby Sensory stream.
[4343.59s -> 4346.28s]  Uh, this is fun.
[4346.28s -> 4350.49s]  What's going on? What's up everybody?
[4350.49s -> 4352.49s]  Okay. I didn't laugh at this one. Let's start this one over.
[4352.49s -> 4358.37s]  What is Baby Sensory? I might go hard mode for that one. We'll find out.
[4358.37s -> 4363.53s]  Please cut the ringing. It sounds kind of like a...
[4371.55s -> 4374.55s]  I know what I have to do but I don't know if I have the strength to do it.
[4377.69s -> 4382.26s]  Jesus!
[4382.26s -> 4387.26s]  Even the babies are one of the most dangerous animals in the world so I built this cage to keep them secure so there's no possible...
[4387.26s -> 4389.26s]  Oh my god.
[4395.94s -> 4407.08s]  You know what I'm saying? If I miss this joke, I'm low key. If I miss this joke, I'm gay as hell. I'm gay as hell if I miss this joke.
[4408.08s -> 4410.08s]  Yo, Baba, how's the food tasting?
[4414.71s -> 4416.71s]  Yo, Baba, how's the food tasting?
[4416.71s -> 4422.71s]  Oh, this stuff is buzzing. Respectfully. No kidding.
[4422.71s -> 4424.71s]  Oh, what about you Abuji?
[4441.94s -> 4446.94s]  I knew he was going to say it too. That's the worst part. He just screamed it.
[4446.94s -> 4449.94s]  Whatever. I have Zoom or humor. I don't care.
[4449.94s -> 4451.94s]  I don't give a shit. Whatever.
[4451.94s -> 4455.39s]  Make a well-crafted joke.
[4455.39s -> 4460.39s]  No, I don't think it's funny. I don't care. You give a whole story of something funny that happened.
[4460.39s -> 4463.39s]  Get an old guy to say sheesh on camera and I'm gone.
[4463.39s -> 4469.81s]  It's just the first part. The first part of the Zoom or humor is funny.
[4469.81s -> 4476.25s]  I think they're quick. That's something I think Zoomers don't get a lot of credit for. Zoomers are quick.
[4476.25s -> 4481.13s]  Now, a lot of Zoom or humor I think falls. It just goes right off my head.
[4481.13s -> 4484.43s]  But man, they're quick. They're quick.
[4484.43s -> 4486.38s]  They're quick.
[4486.38s -> 4493.38s]  The best part about Zoom or humor is because it's so quick, even if it sucks, it's over in three seconds.
[4493.38s -> 4503.54s]  If I don't like a boomer or like older person's joke or something, I might have to sit there for four minutes while they tell me.
[4503.54s -> 4505.54s]  Shit's over in two seconds if you're a Zoomer.
[4505.54s -> 4510.15s]  Alright, I just want to see it again because I like it.
[4510.15s -> 4513.15s]  We're getting so many subs too. This is ridiculous. Thanks everybody.
[4513.15s -> 4516.15s]  25 from you.
[4516.15s -> 4519.33s]  Well, OK, I think it's time to do a hard one.
[4519.33s -> 4522.33s]  Unionize your workplace. Thanks for 25 community subs.
[4522.33s -> 4525.70s]  And then we had 10 from David Shower. Thank you.
[4525.70s -> 4528.94s]  OK, I just want to see it again.
[4528.94s -> 4530.94s]  Oh, Baba, how's the food tasting?
[4530.94s -> 4533.94s]  Oh, this stuff is buzzing.
[4533.94s -> 4535.94s]  You can tell he's waiting his turn to do the joke.
[4535.94s -> 4536.94s]  No.
[4536.94s -> 4537.94s]  It gets me too.
[4537.94s -> 4538.94s]  What about you, Abuji?
[4538.94s -> 4541.78s]  Shit!
[4541.78s -> 4564.89s]  Do you know why he's called Colonel Sanders?
[4564.89s -> 4565.89s]  No, why?
[4565.89s -> 4566.89s]  Because he is...
[4573.69s -> 4576.59s]  Hello, America.
[4611.22s -> 4612.22s]  What?
[4618.33s -> 4619.33s]  Hi.
[4619.33s -> 4621.33s]  The easy way to say
[4623.33s -> 4624.33s]  is to say
[4627.57s -> 4630.79s]  Hold the yogurt?
[4635.42s -> 4649.18s]  Fuck.
[4651.18s -> 4661.38s]  Fuck.
[4665.38s -> 4667.38s]  This guy's fucking crazy.
[4671.50s -> 4673.50s]  Who is this guy? This guy's fucked up.
[4679.06s -> 4682.06s]  Heart of Darkness is about a young boy named Andy.
[4682.06s -> 4683.06s]  Skipping. I'm skipping it.
[4683.06s -> 4685.06s]  I don't...
[4685.06s -> 4686.06s]  We don't watch those videos.
[4686.06s -> 4695.54s]  If we got to add 100, oh shit, I'll get it.
[4695.54s -> 4701.17s]  An embarrassing video.
[4701.17s -> 4703.56s]  Cheater?
[4703.56s -> 4707.36s]  Well, I don't think I'm going to...
[4707.36s -> 4709.36s]  All right, here we go. Listen to me.
[4709.36s -> 4713.37s]  I don't think I'm going to laugh at my own streams, if I'm honest.
[4713.37s -> 4715.99s]  Because, like, I was there.
[4715.99s -> 4721.24s]  No rules, Andy.
[4721.24s -> 4725.21s]  400 subs? What?
[4725.21s -> 4726.58s]  Oh, you just made that up, Art.
[4726.58s -> 4730.54s]  Well, it's because they're not funny.
[4730.54s -> 4738.29s]  No, you can have that opinion.
[4738.29s -> 4740.53s]  If you don't think I'm funny, then that's fine.
[4740.53s -> 4741.53s]  I'm not going to tell you you're wrong.
[4741.53s -> 4745.24s]  Be sad for a minute.
[4745.24s -> 4748.67s]  And then curse you out when I'm in the shower.
[4770.59s -> 4772.59s]  I like a height. I like a climb.
[4772.59s -> 4774.59s]  But, like, she stepped on a church.
[4774.59s -> 4777.28s]  I mean, a knee building, really.
[4777.28s -> 4779.28s]  Because, legally, they're not supposed to be able to ask you about that
[4779.28s -> 4782.28s]  on, like, your homeowners' association application.
[4782.28s -> 4784.28s]  But they'll ask. They'll look it up.
[4784.28s -> 4787.28s]  If she doesn't exist in the same physical timeline as I am...
[4787.28s -> 4791.04s]  What's the poster in the back?
[4791.04s -> 4792.04s]  I'm not doing that again.
[4792.04s -> 4800.22s]  Is it Nightmare Before Christmas?
[4800.22s -> 4810.05s]  Hi, this is Tommy Weasel, creator of The Room.
[4810.05s -> 4814.05s]  Let me introduce you to the new Joker.
[4814.05s -> 4818.66s]  Hi.
[4863.41s -> 4865.41s]  Can we laugh, please?
[4869.06s -> 4886.78s]  Dude, the only thing that's making me laugh is the fact that we dress...
[4886.78s -> 4889.78s]  He's dressed in baby clothes, like, human baby clothes.
[4889.78s -> 4892.96s]  It's just so... What are we doing?
[4892.96s -> 4914.05s]  Don't talk about this.
[4914.05s -> 4926.98s]  This edible ain't shit.
[4936.38s -> 4938.38s]  Can you tell me where I'm on this?
[4938.38s -> 4940.38s]  I'll add it. I'll add it. I almost laughed at the GTA one,
[4940.38s -> 4943.38s]  not because it was a car, but because of something very specific.
[4943.38s -> 4946.38s]  Hit F2 to save clip in the corner.
[4946.38s -> 4949.38s]  You know that motherfucker was like...
[4949.38s -> 4951.38s]  That's what they hit F2.
[4951.38s -> 4962.06s]  I have to go back?
[4962.06s -> 4964.06s]  I said I wouldn't laugh at myself.
[4964.06s -> 4969.28s]  But that was just so fucking weird.
[4969.28s -> 4971.28s]  It was so outrageously strong.
[4971.28s -> 4974.16s]  All right. I'll get through it. I'll get through it.
[4974.16s -> 4976.16s]  I'll get through it. I'll get through it.
[4976.16s -> 4979.87s]  This edible ain't shit.
[4979.87s -> 4981.87s]  I just look like a different person. Okay.
[4981.87s -> 4989.53s]  Can you tell me where Armand Kristoff is hiding?
[4989.53s -> 4991.53s]  He's not going to do shit.
[4991.53s -> 4994.28s]  I'm in hiding from the Imperial watch.
[4994.28s -> 4996.28s]  It's funny, but it's not Thomas the Tank Engine.
[4996.28s -> 4998.28s]  I just punched him, sorry.
[4998.28s -> 5002.95s]  No, dude. What are you doing?
[5008.61s -> 5037.02s]  This is fucking gross!
[5037.02s -> 5045.34s]  I'm not even going to laugh.
[5045.34s -> 5047.34s]  What the... All right. I'm getting it off.
[5047.34s -> 5049.34s]  Get it off. Get it off. Get it off. I don't want to listen to it anymore.
[5049.34s -> 5051.34s]  I don't want to listen to it anymore.
[5051.34s -> 5053.34s]  I don't want to listen to it anymore.
[5053.34s -> 5070.24s]  I don't want to listen to it anymore. Get it off.
[5070.24s -> 5072.99s]  Hey, hold on a second. I don't want to be late.
[5072.99s -> 5075.87s]  Let me finish this.
[5075.87s -> 5077.87s]  Fuck.
[5081.87s -> 5100.11s]  Holy shit.
[5106.15s -> 5108.15s]  That was insane.
[5112.50s -> 5119.86s]  You're sick right there.
[5167.80s -> 5172.79s]  Oh, my God.
[5172.79s -> 5181.18s]  That was just cool.
[5181.18s -> 5186.30s]  I love refrigerator.
[5190.54s -> 5192.54s]  I've seen this one.
[5196.54s -> 5198.54s]  It's classic.
[5200.54s -> 5207.90s]  It's classic, but it's not going to get me.
[5216.14s -> 5220.14s]  This is actually real. It can't be.
[5227.74s -> 5230.11s]  It's real.
[5246.80s -> 5248.80s]  It's uncanny, Lisa.
[5260.80s -> 5262.80s]  It's classic.
[5262.80s -> 5264.80s]  It's a real sketch.
[5274.80s -> 5276.80s]  I'm trying to...
[5276.80s -> 5278.80s]  Okay, I'm good. I'm safe.
[5278.80s -> 5281.04s]  Oh, shit.
[5295.10s -> 5298.04s]  We're going to go viral with this one.
[5304.60s -> 5306.60s]  I've seen this video about two or three hundred times in the last six months.
[5306.60s -> 5308.60s]  It's not going to get me, but it's my favorite.
[5308.60s -> 5310.60s]  One of my favorite videos ever.
[5310.60s -> 5312.60s]  I'm not going to reenact this. I'll die.
[5320.58s -> 5322.58s]  That sock dog shooter.
[5322.58s -> 5329.24s]  Slimer, it is.
[5329.24s -> 5346.57s]  Do we already see this one?
[5346.57s -> 5357.90s]  Oh, he just walked by.
[5357.90s -> 5367.42s]  This is bromine.
[5367.42s -> 5369.98s]  No, wait, sorry.
[5369.98s -> 5372.98s]  That was soy sauce.
[5372.98s -> 5374.98s]  This is bromine.
[5374.98s -> 5378.25s]  Duke, do you want the ball?
[5400.94s -> 5402.94s]  What is happening in this photo?
[5402.94s -> 5406.20s]  I don't understand.
[5406.20s -> 5410.87s]  What?
[5410.87s -> 5417.98s]  What?
[5417.98s -> 5419.98s]  He turned...
[5419.98s -> 5422.22s]  Is it upside down?
[5422.22s -> 5425.10s]  It's not a filter.
[5425.10s -> 5427.10s]  I think he's upside down in this photo.
[5427.10s -> 5432.28s]  Jesus.
[5432.28s -> 5434.28s]  God damn it.
[5434.28s -> 5437.54s]  That was stupid.
[5437.54s -> 5439.54s]  RTX on.
[5439.54s -> 5441.91s]  I think he's hanging upside down.
[5441.91s -> 5443.91s]  He's upside down.
[5443.91s -> 5447.75s]  Fucked up upside down photo.
[5447.75s -> 5454.41s]  Is that 18? Did I do it twice?
[5454.41s -> 5464.84s]  It's because he's flexing.
[5464.84s -> 5467.53s]  That's 18. We'll go back.
[5467.53s -> 5474.50s]  This one was crazy, too.
[5474.50s -> 5489.66s]  I'm doing it one more time.
[5494.01s -> 5496.01s]  Okay, I'm over.
[5498.01s -> 5500.01s]  I've seen this a million times.
[5530.20s -> 5532.20s]  Where's my lip balm?
[5548.65s -> 5551.59s]  Oh, Jesus.
[5551.59s -> 5566.38s]  What the hell is going on?
[5566.38s -> 5585.69s]  Why is it two?
[5585.69s -> 5587.69s]  It's two people.
[5587.69s -> 5591.38s]  Oh, it's the dog.
[5591.38s -> 5597.53s]  Okay, they swapped out the dog.
[5597.53s -> 5599.70s]  That's so weird.
[5599.70s -> 5606.74s]  He's not going to piss, is he?
[5606.74s -> 5614.17s]  I think I'm okay.
[5614.17s -> 5636.62s]  I think I'm all right.
[5636.62s -> 5655.50s]  I think I'm going to be okay.
[5655.50s -> 5658.38s]  Cute.
[5658.38s -> 5660.38s]  Holy shit.
[5662.38s -> 5677.80s]  That was...
[5686.55s -> 5688.55s]  Could any human do that?
[5688.55s -> 5691.94s]  If somebody practiced that enough,
[5691.94s -> 5695.94s]  would it even be possible to do even the first part of that?
[5695.94s -> 5698.82s]  It's a lucky thing I had my pieces.
[5698.82s -> 5701.96s]  Your pieces?
[5701.96s -> 5703.96s]  My guns.
[5703.96s -> 5705.96s]  Anyway, I started blasting.
[5705.96s -> 5707.96s]  I don't see so good, so I missed.
[5707.96s -> 5709.96s]  Then they ran away.
[5709.96s -> 5711.96s]  I ran after them.
[5711.96s -> 5713.96s]  I tried to shoot them in the back,
[5713.96s -> 5715.96s]  but I don't know if it's so good either.
[5715.96s -> 5717.96s]  I don't play video games,
[5717.96s -> 5752.20s]  so I don't know what that's a reference to.
[5752.20s -> 5772.36s]  I've seen it, but it's good.
[5772.36s -> 5778.12s]  Siri, take a note.
[5778.12s -> 5781.00s]  What's the note?
[5781.00s -> 5784.26s]  Inside the cave.
[5784.26s -> 5786.26s]  Sharing two sticks with a guy,
[5786.26s -> 5788.95s]  some homeless guy, threw up in his mouth.
[5788.95s -> 5791.58s]  Mickey Mouse comes in
[5791.58s -> 5794.52s]  and drains all my battery from my iPod.
[5794.52s -> 5800.54s]  I kiss him.
[5800.54s -> 5803.99s]  I knew it was coming.
[5803.99s -> 5805.99s]  Drains all my battery from my iPod.
[5805.99s -> 5812.39s]  I kiss him.
[5812.39s -> 5814.63s]  What the fuck?
[5814.63s -> 5816.63s]  I'm so weird. I swear to God I'm not high right now.
[5816.63s -> 5818.81s]  I thought I was blocking the face cam.
[5818.81s -> 5822.52s]  I actually thought I was blocking this face cam.
[5822.52s -> 5824.52s]  I was like, oh shit, I gotta get out of the way.
[5824.52s -> 5827.78s]  There's another face cam.
[5827.78s -> 5831.62s]  I swear to God I'm not on hard mode.
[5831.62s -> 5836.86s]  What the fuck?
[5836.86s -> 5839.42s]  That was really good.
[5839.42s -> 5841.42s]  Let me take some inventory here.
[5841.42s -> 5843.42s]  Let me see where we're at.
[5843.42s -> 5845.66s]  And I gotta pee.
[5845.66s -> 5847.66s]  Let's see.
[5847.66s -> 5850.60s]  1,900 bucks is in the pool?
[5850.60s -> 5853.80s]  Let me see. I don't wanna spoil anything.
[5853.80s -> 5855.80s]  We are getting close.
[5855.80s -> 5858.23s]  We're getting close.
[5858.23s -> 5860.73s]  I'm gonna go pee. I'll be right back.
[5860.73s -> 5862.73s]  We've got about 50 or 60 more videos
[5862.73s -> 5865.86s]  until we get to the baby sensory shit.
[5865.86s -> 5870.65s]  Which I have no idea how that's gonna go.
[5870.65s -> 5872.65s]  I have no idea.
[5872.65s -> 5878.54s]  And by the way,
[5878.54s -> 5880.54s]  well I'm not gonna say this yet because I'm not done.
[5880.54s -> 5883.61s]  I could watch another compilation.
[5883.61s -> 5885.61s]  I'm into that. This is fun.
[5885.61s -> 5889.32s]  This actually is fun to do.
[5889.32s -> 5891.32s]  I'm having a great time.
[5891.32s -> 5893.32s]  I'll be right back. I'm just gonna go pee.
[5893.32s -> 5896.31s]  And we'll keep going. See you guys in a minute.
[5896.31s -> 6188.31s]  Hello. I've returned.
[6188.31s -> 6195.67s]  I found my lip balm. Thank God.
[6195.67s -> 6197.67s]  Alright. Let's keep going.
[6197.67s -> 6199.67s]  We've got about 60 videos left in this playlist
[6199.67s -> 6201.67s]  and then we're gonna move to the baby sensory.
[6201.67s -> 6205.75s]  It is Burt's Bees.
[6205.75s -> 6214.26s]  Why'd I say hello like that?
[6214.26s -> 6218.79s]  I don't know.
[6218.79s -> 6220.79s]  This is a lot of fun though.
[6220.79s -> 6223.35s]  I've been doing this and didn't do it for a long time.
[6223.35s -> 6225.35s]  Because I was like, I don't even know how to do that
[6225.35s -> 6227.35s]  or where to start or how would I even
[6227.35s -> 6234.50s]  do I even really care. It's fun.
[6234.50s -> 6236.50s]  I'm not gonna do this every single stream.
[6236.50s -> 6239.83s]  Did I find my vape?
[6239.83s -> 6243.91s]  Normie?
[6243.91s -> 6246.66s]  I'm not a normie.
[6246.66s -> 6254.33s]  Alright, let's go.
[6254.33s -> 6256.89s]  There we go.
[6256.89s -> 6264.74s]  Let us continue.
[6264.74s -> 6268.97s]  This needs to be like over here or something.
[6268.97s -> 6270.97s]  Let me brighten this up.
[6270.97s -> 6285.94s]  It looks like I'm sitting in front of a campfire.
[6285.94s -> 6294.26s]  Oh, that looks worse.
[6294.26s -> 6296.26s]  Look at how much more handsome I look when it's up here.
[6296.26s -> 6299.91s]  Lighting is just
[6299.91s -> 6303.11s]  matters so much. Look at this.
[6303.11s -> 6305.48s]  This is with a light directly in my face.
[6305.48s -> 6308.41s]  Look at that.
[6308.41s -> 6311.16s]  Look at the difference. It's just so much better.
[6311.16s -> 6314.04s]  Down here, that's why.
[6314.04s -> 6316.04s]  It's because I have a big brow bone. Can I make it stay up here?
[6316.04s -> 6322.74s]  It actually might stay up here.
[6322.74s -> 6325.48s]  Dude, look at that.
[6325.48s -> 6327.48s]  I have like a real light in my face now.
[6327.48s -> 6335.42s]  Okay. I just can't move that much.
[6335.42s -> 6338.04s]  Actually, that's dangerous for it to be up there.
[6338.04s -> 6343.74s]  Alright, let's go.
[6343.74s -> 6345.74s]  Back to it. Did I scam?
[6345.74s -> 6348.68s]  Is it 2000?
[6348.68s -> 6350.98s]  He zonked.
[6350.98s -> 6361.59s]  Not yet!
[6361.59s -> 6364.34s]  Is it 19? Okay. I'm making sure I didn't scam.
[6364.34s -> 6366.90s]  Here we go. I am ready.
[6366.90s -> 6378.15s]  Can you see it?
[6378.15s -> 6385.82s]  Volume back up.
[6385.82s -> 6392.60s]  Let's go.
[6412.17s -> 6414.17s]  No!
[6425.11s -> 6427.11s]  Okay, so my GoPro setup isn't perfect yet.
[6427.11s -> 6429.11s]  And I'm glad you guys are getting a kick out of it.
[6429.11s -> 6431.11s]  But, I really want it to be better.
[6431.11s -> 6433.11s]  This video
[6433.11s -> 6435.11s]  exemplifies why
[6435.11s -> 6437.11s]  I need to work on this so much.
[6437.11s -> 6439.11s]  It's really hard to keep that
[6439.11s -> 6441.11s]  long, stiff street pole
[6441.11s -> 6443.11s]  all the way out there that you need
[6443.11s -> 6445.11s]  for the 360 cam to work right.
[6445.11s -> 6448.25s]  He's got a lawnmower
[6448.25s -> 6450.25s]  and he's like a little kid right there.
[6450.25s -> 6482.62s]  Just scary.
[6482.62s -> 6484.62s]  I love this game.
[6484.62s -> 6501.30s]  At the end I almost got me.
[6536.62s -> 6538.62s]  That was really cool. I wouldn't say that was funny. That was cool.
[6538.62s -> 6562.28s]  What?
[6564.28s -> 6566.28s]  Why? Do you see anything else?
[6570.71s -> 6572.71s]  Kids nowadays.
[6574.71s -> 6576.71s]  My baby must be sending letters.
[6576.71s -> 6578.71s]  I'll be back in a hurry, great grandma.
[6578.71s -> 6580.71s]  Always in a hurry.
[6586.71s -> 6588.71s]  Isn't that what Santa does?
[6588.71s -> 6590.71s]  It was from my heart.
[6594.71s -> 6596.71s]  She doesn't get it.
[6600.71s -> 6602.71s]  What's going on?
[6602.71s -> 6605.91s]  How? I feel so bad.
[6616.25s -> 6618.25s]  We can always work things.
[6618.25s -> 6620.25s]  Great grandma, you always know
[6620.25s -> 6622.25s]  just what to say.
[6628.25s -> 6634.46s]  That was cute. I like how cute that one is.
[6659.59s -> 6661.59s]  How to save people in the elevator in Black Mesa.
[6661.59s -> 6685.45s]  What?
[6685.45s -> 6687.45s]  Can you actually get them out?
[6687.45s -> 6693.66s]  Oh shit.
[6693.66s -> 6697.88s]  Goodbye.
[6703.59s -> 6705.59s]  This is your content, Jerma.
[6713.59s -> 6715.59s]  Bright.
[6721.59s -> 6727.54s]  This is why I can't play Oblivion.
[6727.54s -> 6729.54s]  Ever.
[6729.54s -> 6731.54s]  985.
[6745.54s -> 6747.54s]  Just auto fill on your iPhone.
[6755.54s -> 6757.54s]  What's happening? That was weird.
[6757.54s -> 6764.84s]  No.
[6778.84s -> 6781.46s]  What?
[6781.46s -> 6783.46s]  Is jellyfish a herb?
[6783.46s -> 6790.38s]  That was close.
[6790.38s -> 6796.65s]  Is it 3am?
[6796.65s -> 6802.54s]  Oh don't.
[6802.54s -> 6805.80s]  So is it any wonder people are afraid
[6805.80s -> 6807.80s]  of technology?
[6807.80s -> 6811.90s]  Have you ever had a dream
[6811.90s -> 6813.90s]  that
[6813.90s -> 6815.90s]  you had
[6815.90s -> 6817.90s]  you could
[6817.90s -> 6819.90s]  you want
[6819.90s -> 6821.90s]  you could do so
[6821.90s -> 6823.90s]  you could
[6823.90s -> 6825.90s]  you want him to do
[6825.90s -> 6827.90s]  you so much you could do anything?
[6827.90s -> 6829.90s]  That's a great video.
[6829.90s -> 6832.33s]  It's just a good video.
[6832.33s -> 6834.33s]  Pay no attention, it's fine.
[6834.33s -> 6836.33s]  You want me to go up there?
[6836.33s -> 6838.33s]  Trick or treating at my house?
[6838.33s -> 6845.56s]  I think I've seen this.
[6845.56s -> 6851.69s]  Hey look.
[6855.45s -> 6857.45s]  Thanks Jerma.
[6857.45s -> 6859.45s]  So weird.
[6871.02s -> 6873.02s]  I'm so pale.
[6873.02s -> 6875.02s]  I look like a fucking
[6875.02s -> 6879.69s]  look at how weird I look.
[6919.03s -> 6923.26s]  I've never seen this.
[6923.26s -> 6925.69s]  I just did not expect that at all.
[6925.69s -> 6934.90s]  You know why
[6934.90s -> 6936.90s]  this is so surprising to me?
[6936.90s -> 6938.90s]  I've never seen Rocky 2.
[6938.90s -> 6941.53s]  I just know that Rocky's a guy
[6941.53s -> 6943.53s]  and he wears like pajamas and works out
[6943.53s -> 6945.53s]  and then fights people.
[6945.53s -> 6947.53s]  I've only seen like an hour of Rocky total.
[6993.40s -> 6998.97s]  Hey Brad.
[6998.97s -> 7000.97s]  I bet you can't laugh without
[7000.97s -> 7003.91s]  smiling.
[7003.91s -> 7006.47s]  What are you talking about?
[7006.47s -> 7008.47s]  Oh, seriously.
[7008.47s -> 7010.47s]  It's not even that hard. Watch.
[7029.64s -> 7034.95s]  This is freaking me out.
[7034.95s -> 7052.98s]  That was freaking me out. Loud.
[7052.98s -> 7059.58s]  23 in the chamber.
[7059.58s -> 7061.58s]  They ain't found me yet, but when they do
[7061.58s -> 7063.58s]  they're gonna be surprised.
[7103.50s -> 7121.78s]  It's the zoomed in
[7121.78s -> 7126.07s]  close up. He hit that
[7126.07s -> 7128.07s]  hard. You can see his whole
[7128.07s -> 7130.76s]  body like jiggles.
[7130.76s -> 7132.76s]  Hold on. I've never seen some of these videos before.
[7132.76s -> 7136.09s]  Jeez.
[7136.09s -> 7138.09s]  Just look at this.
[7140.09s -> 7142.09s]  Let us have a moment of silence for this man's
[7142.09s -> 7144.09s]  fallen brothers as you see.
[7144.09s -> 7146.09s]  It's, okay.
[7146.09s -> 7148.09s]  It's the fact that it's just, it's not necessarily the commentary.
[7148.09s -> 7150.09s]  It's just the, oh my god.
[7150.09s -> 7152.09s]  How? That would be so awful.
[7152.09s -> 7154.65s]  Okay.
[7154.65s -> 7159.38s]  What do we add? Is it 22 or 23?
[7159.38s -> 7164.17s]  Alright.
[7164.17s -> 7166.34s]  I actually gotta relax.
[7166.34s -> 7168.34s]  Because this still is in place in Baby Sensory
[7168.34s -> 7170.34s]  and I don't think I'm gonna be able to handle, I can't handle Baby Sensory.
[7170.34s -> 7172.90s]  I don't think I'll be able to handle it.
[7172.90s -> 7177.82s]  Let's go.
[7177.82s -> 7198.14s]  All
[7198.14s -> 7200.14s]  the
[7200.14s -> 7207.96s]  All the
[7207.96s -> 7209.96s]  Shouldn't
[7209.96s -> 7213.22s]  have
[7213.22s -> 7217.64s]  Packed
[7217.64s -> 7219.64s]  you kill the child.
[7219.64s -> 7221.64s]  Amazing mission complete.
[7221.64s -> 7223.64s]  That right there is why you are the best.
[7223.64s -> 7225.64s]  Everyone knows her
[7225.64s -> 7227.64s]  father is a lunatic. He was in here
[7227.64s -> 7229.64s]  tonight. Raven.
[7229.64s -> 7232.90s]  Mm-hmm.
[7232.90s -> 7261.14s]  Um, is it what a mint julep? Okay. What the fuck just holy shit. Okay, that was scary
[7262.90s -> 7266.10s]  Wait, wait, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, I got
[7266.50s -> 7271.38s]  Six I gave points for the tattoo reveal. I thought that was completely unique
[7271.70s -> 7274.58s]  I also gave points because she had delicious barbecue
[7274.66s -> 7277.94s]  I took points away because I was stung by a bee for the first time
[7278.34s -> 7282.98s]  And I think that is attributed to the 50 000 bees that are kept on the premises
[7294.04s -> 7296.04s]  Oh, look at them they're having so much fun
[7299.85s -> 7304.57s]  It's all right. You know, here's what's happening here. They both want the other one to chase them
[7306.20s -> 7311.56s]  So when they're realizing that they're getting stuck in like a math loop of like their ai won't do it
[7315.75s -> 7325.45s]  They keep resetting
[7325.45s -> 7333.96s]  Like why have you not chased me yet? I'm supposed to you sit. Well, why are you not chasing me? That was fun. That was cute
[7335.78s -> 7338.18s]  Hey, guess what i'm having today. Fuck man
[7339.30s -> 7341.30s]  Fucking steak, baby. Yeah
[7342.02s -> 7344.02s]  the ribeye mashed potatoes

[7390.17s -> 7393.62s]  What the fuck
[7393.70s -> 7397.03s]  Can you imagine that happening to you?
[7433.80s -> 7435.80s]  That was really close
[7439.03s -> 7448.81s]  What was what what was this one titled protocols not banished in origin it's
[7449.93s -> 7468.11s]  Sturdier than I expected. I don't play halo. I don't get it cortana
[7468.51s -> 7484.76s]  No problem
[7487.34s -> 7508.73s]  I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm all right
[7537.44s -> 7540.64s]  I knew it was coming. I love this video
[7543.79s -> 7553.00s]  Look at how pissed this cat gets. This cat is so angry that the dog farted god
[7556.14s -> 7559.10s]  The end of that that ad went on a very long time
[7559.58s -> 7563.20s]  What how why do you laugh at this laughed at nothing?
[7565.44s -> 7569.44s]  Because I because I know i'm gonna laugh at this video and the thanos one was holy shit
[7569.44s -> 7572.40s]  It was a miracle. I was able to hold through that one and then oh my god
[7572.40s -> 7575.36s]  Here comes like one of my favorite funny cat hits the dog for farting videos
[7576.00s -> 7614.76s]  Nope. Okay. I got it 24. It's fake. I just it's still funny
[7616.01s -> 7618.01s]  No, no more thanos shit
[7647.28s -> 7652.25s]  That's so annoying. What a bunch of fucking assholes. What a bunch of dicks
[7655.12s -> 7657.12s]  This is the last video in this playlist
[7659.45s -> 7662.97s]  Just okay, it wouldn't be funny to me if it was anywhere else, but he's at like the airport
[7663.68s -> 7667.04s]  He has to show his id and the fact that they're like very far away
[7667.04s -> 7673.93s]  That's the only reason why it was funny if they were anywhere else. We are at
[7675.35s -> 7683.63s]  $2,500 this playlist is over. That does not mean that this is over
[7685.02s -> 7687.02s]  Coming up next is hard mode
[7687.26s -> 7689.74s]  And baby sensory videos and after that
[7690.78s -> 7697.90s]  We might actually do a few more just compilations. Maybe some of the mods can um, I don't want to say this because I don't want a fucking
[7698.78s -> 7706.06s]  Five trillion people to hit up the mods, but maybe another compilation or so get a couple maybe one or two more
[7706.22s -> 7710.24s]  What's the pool for?
[7710.24s -> 7714.16s]  So at the end of this stream i'm going to divvy this up and we're going to give it to charity
[7714.92s -> 7720.92s]  So I have a charity in mind that I might just give the whole thing to find out. Well, not not a charity necessarily
[7721.24s -> 7730.20s]  But an organization, so this is fun 2,500 so far. All right, let me let's watch this last one and see if it's going to work
[7730.20s -> 7732.20s]  Work
[7740.88s -> 7744.41s]  Okay, we're good
[7744.41s -> 7747.42s]  Tell what the pool is for in your title
[7747.42s -> 7759.88s]  Uh, okay. Yeah, i'll update the title because now we're nice lighting that wasn't in the playlist. This was just autoplay
[7760.12s -> 7772.59s]  What are you serious? Okay. All right. Give me one second. Let me uh,
[7774.17s -> 7777.93s]  Let me just instead of putting in the title. It's probably easier to do this
[7778.33s -> 7785.42s]  I'll make it a little smaller too. So it's not
[7785.50s -> 7793.50s]  Okay, uh getting a lot of community subs too. Uh, thank you. Kiki lime pie for the 10
[7794.36s -> 7798.76s]  Uh, thank you oi pmc for the 10 vessel for the five and then sarah ryan
[7799.48s -> 7806.46s]  Saran ocean for the 25 community subs. I don't I don't know if I can handle this. This is gonna be really weird. Um
[7807.32s -> 7809.72s]  I was gonna have a notepad open where I write my feelings down
[7809.72s -> 7814.83s]  But I think that you laugh you lose shit still is fine. So let me get that on
[7814.99s -> 7826.56s]  Let's get the first one on here. So this one is oh god
[7828.41s -> 7834.27s]  This is still you laugh you lose by the way. I just found these on youtube. I don't know how they are
[7835.16s -> 7837.96s]  I don't know anything really about them. I have no idea
[7838.58s -> 7856.32s]  Absolutely, no clue here comes a baby early learning sensory video three two one
[7858.40s -> 7861.53s]  Hello, baby
[7864.70s -> 7869.63s]  Circle
[7874.97s -> 7894.01s]  Okay, it's like breathing i'm just thinking about the fact that i'm doing this right now i'm actually watching these and it's it's making
[7903.12s -> 7905.76s]  This is scary. It's kind of scary for adults
[7913.82s -> 7930.36s]  So what this supposed to be high contrast is a clockwork orange. I'm about to veto this
[7932.59s -> 7935.28s]  all gone
[7935.84s -> 7937.84s]  I think I have to veto this whole thing
[7948.49s -> 7956.08s]  Fucking cloud music in the background is it is it circle? What is it? It's a circle. It's a circle
[7961.50s -> 7963.34s]  Okay, um
[7963.34s -> 7966.22s]  I'm gonna i'm gonna just go ahead and uh say this
[7967.45s -> 7969.58s]  um
[7969.58s -> 7971.58s]  Feed your babies a well-balanced diet, please
[7971.98s -> 7972.94s]  and
[7972.94s -> 7977.10s]  Like you have like objects in your house like keys and stuff. You can play like peekaboo
[7977.18s -> 7979.90s]  I don't know if I want I don't know if i'd want a baby to sit down
[7980.38s -> 7984.38s]  This is 22 minutes. I don't think I want a baby sit down and like get we'll see this
[7985.26s -> 7989.18s]  I want to like draw this in a notebook and be like that's a look that's a circle
[7989.58s -> 7996.49s]  I feel like if you have this on autoplay do it on times two speed
[7997.05s -> 8001.85s]  All right, maybe there's a bunch of science about it that like this is like developed like it's okay
[8001.85s -> 8004.81s]  You know like um when adults play a brain age for the ds
[8005.37s -> 8020.32s]  Maybe that maybe this is literally just brain age for an infant. I have no idea. Okay
[8027.64s -> 8029.24s]  Shit is for babies
[8029.24s -> 8031.48s]  It's it is i'm getting scared
[8031.96s -> 8065.55s]  I have to put it like a warning here because it's gonna be um, this is times two
[8065.71s -> 8077.18s]  But what in the meantime, uh, if we if there's any more you laugh you lose compilations
[8078.27s -> 8081.55s]  I'd love to watch them. Maybe just we can get them vetted quickly or something
[8081.55s -> 8085.07s]  But um, I ain't watching i'm done after this. This is fucking what a shit idea
[8085.31s -> 8088.51s]  This is one of the worst ideas i've ever had
[8088.51s -> 8090.91s]  Well ever one of the worst ideas i've ever had
[8093.85s -> 8095.85s]  Uh, so i'm gonna put a warning here first
[8095.85s -> 8110.59s]  Okay, there we go. I'm not doing all 22 minutes. We're going to another you laugh you lose
[8111.71s -> 8130.89s]  Okay, here we go
[8130.89s -> 8146.12s]  crazy
[8154.44s -> 8156.44s]  I forgot it was in times two speed
[8156.84s -> 8161.48s]  I forgot it was in times two speed man. I thought like what the fuck is what is this alien video?
[8161.48s -> 8170.43s]  We're watching I was like, why is it like this? I forgot it was times two
[8170.91s -> 8179.68s]  But yeah, if a mod has another good compilation
[8180.38s -> 8182.38s]  Uh, is it just even when you find?
[8183.10s -> 8220.03s]  Okay, here we go. I'm doing this up to up to five to ten minutes and that's it. I gotta turn that off
[8220.03s -> 8233.31s]  It's too much. This is horrifying. Okay, i'm done
[8244.84s -> 8249.88s]  No, i'm not gonna keep it up and keep it times two. Okay, there are 30 000 people here
[8251.40s -> 8254.52s]  What a weird like it would I feel like if I clicked on this stream
[8255.52s -> 8262.91s]  They're watching a times two speed baby sensory video. Why are they doing this? What's wrong with them?
[8265.90s -> 8270.78s]  This is cultish at this point if I was just sitting here like two times baby sensory videos
[8272.14s -> 8275.82s]  I this is getting I don't know. It's freaking me out. I don't think I can do
[8278.46s -> 8281.82s]  All right, i'll do times two for for 10 more seconds ready

[8360.04s -> 8367.34s]  Okay, best one guy moment. All right. Let me give me one second
[8367.34s -> 8369.34s]  Let me just look at to see if we have any more compilations to do
[8382.81s -> 8390.80s]  Do we do we have any more wario where?

[8700.20s -> 8708.76s]  Go back did I miss one? Sure, please, uh, get a better playlist. This is 2013
[8709.16s -> 8717.36s]  Well, we're off the original playlist. I've been here for two and a half hours doing this. Holy shit
[8720.84s -> 8725.29s]  Damn. All right. I'm not going back to baby sensory
[8726.27s -> 8736.25s]  No, all right. I'm gonna finish this one out and we'll get another one. Okay. Here we go
[8736.57s -> 8747.23s]  Cheeseburger hand pies are a fun twist on a classic meal in a large
[8749.69s -> 8755.13s]  Fun hold on
[8755.21s -> 8758.25s]  Let's get oh man that hurts
[8769.68s -> 8777.36s]  Holy shit
[8784.36s -> 8786.36s]  Oh that sounds like his teeth
[8801.71s -> 8830.78s]  I don't get it
[8830.78s -> 8844.86s]  Yeah, these are too quick for me to react to my brain like moves on the baby video was better
[8852.99s -> 8855.31s]  When's auto's birthday auto's birthday is
[8856.19s -> 8858.19s]  Uh, we don't know probably somewhere around march
[8859.72s -> 8861.72s]  Because auto's a rescue. So I don't know exactly when
[8862.36s -> 8864.80s]  But they think march somewhere between march and may
[8864.96s -> 8872.96s]  What happened to the what happened to the tv resolution burning guy? It was a joke. We got had
[8873.79s -> 8878.35s]  Uh, he sent another video that was that was him doing a rick roll. So
[8879.55s -> 8890.75s]  That was the ultimate one guy for sure. We're on animal videos. All right, let's let's let's let's get this one out
[8890.99s -> 8908.01s]  And then i'm gonna take one more break and we'll see if we get another one coming up. What's up house?
[8908.96s -> 8915.08s]  All right, it's so hot
[8916.91s -> 8918.91s]  I could feel that all the way over here
[8918.99s -> 8924.73s]  What on america's money's home videos do we just watch an old episode of america's money's home videos
[8926.59s -> 8933.74s]  That actually sounds awesome
[8933.74s -> 8938.06s]  I'm just realizing what this poor guy just did that you what what just happened the whole tree fell apart
[8962.06s -> 8969.63s]  Hold on I need to see what you're talking about somebody said they thought that this was a
[8970.27s -> 8972.27s]  Teller was like this guy was a dog
[8973.79s -> 8977.68s]  It is a dog
[8977.68s -> 8986.08s]  What are you talking about? I thought that guy was a dog
[8987.15s -> 9009.80s]  Yeah, because it was a dog
[9009.80s -> 9013.08s]  Oh
[9013.08s -> 9015.72s]  I was waiting for like the chandelier to fall
[9015.72s -> 9022.08s]  Like I thought it was gonna be like the chandelier was gonna go like in the background or something
[9022.48s -> 9032.64s]  I was like, what the hell is this video?
[9032.64s -> 9042.06s]  Watch how it's made. Are we going just full react andy today? Is that what it is? All right. Let me go pee
[9042.62s -> 9048.46s]  We'll get we'll let me get like two or three more ready to go. I'll be right back
[9050.49s -> 9052.49s]  Do how it's made on times 10 speed
[9053.05s -> 9057.93s]  Dude, my favorite part is the zoomer sensory videos
[9058.86s -> 9062.86s]  Ah, that's so fun. I'll be right back. You just peed
[9064.80s -> 9265.21s]  I've been drinking water. Somebody said do a baby sensory stream where you treat us like babies. I don't think so
[9265.45s -> 9282.20s]  All right. Here's what we're gonna do. I only really planned on this stream being about three hours
[9283.04s -> 9290.80s]  So we will watch maybe one or two little things here and then I was gonna be live tomorrow
[9291.44s -> 9293.44s]  with monster rancher
[9295.10s -> 9299.07s]  End of the stream voice not yet
[9299.07s -> 9304.91s]  I mean, there's only somebody like hours in a row of of just meme content that your brain can accept that like
[9305.45s -> 9307.45s]  Facebook video
[9307.55s -> 9311.63s]  Where I got locked and had and that added a thousand dollars to the pool
[9314.03s -> 9317.23s]  Yeah, I I mean after three hours of this you kind of funny it out
[9319.21s -> 9321.21s]  But I want to finish monster rancher
[9328.17s -> 9330.17s]  And what else what else?
[9333.48s -> 9336.92s]  I don't think we'll be in monster ranch for that much longer. I don't think so
[9337.72s -> 9348.03s]  You but I can't the baby sensory thing was a fun idea and then in practice
[9348.83s -> 9352.03s]  Was just way too much that's way too much for me and way too much for you
[9353.05s -> 9355.37s]  Especially at times two speed. Oh, no way
[9358.94s -> 9368.16s]  It was horrible
[9368.16s -> 9383.90s]  Yeah, I don't think I can put on america's funnystone videos like the one that's the current season. It was perfect
[9384.88s -> 9387.52s]  I mean, I think it was funny once I realized I had to leave
[9388.16s -> 9395.45s]  So let me let me go over this real quick too though
[9399.15s -> 9402.35s]  We want more we want more watch the dancing fruits one
[9405.02s -> 9408.70s]  All right, i'll put on the dancing fruit one and then after that i'm probably just gonna go
[9410.38s -> 9412.38s]  And we'll be live tomorrow with video games
[9418.24s -> 9422.27s]  It's too much
[9422.27s -> 9424.83s]  You know those like three plus hour long
[9425.47s -> 9429.82s]  the meme compilations
[9429.82s -> 9431.82s]  after hour number two of that
[9432.75s -> 9435.47s]  I kind of I kind of want to go like eat a sandwich
[9439.74s -> 9445.34s]  All right. What was it going over here? Okay, let's put on the baby sensory dancing fruit one
[9448.72s -> 9454.27s]  Uh, let me break down where this money's gonna go by the way. There is a dancing fruit one. You're right
[9468.54s -> 9470.46s]  Please peep the horror
[9470.46s -> 9475.87s]  Um, I think I did that for like five straight minutes on the sensory stream. I don't think you need me to do that again
[9477.74s -> 9479.26s]  All right, let's break this down
[9479.26s -> 9484.84s]  Coming back. I don't think that's even accurate anymore the flashing lights thing
[9486.27s -> 9495.72s]  Hey, who knows but i'm this maybe this stuff isn't like very engaging to a child's brain. I don't know just in case
[9496.36s -> 9515.12s]  Okay, uh, okay fruit fruit salad dance party. Hey, you just peeped the horror for 20 minutes. Yeah
[9515.76s -> 9528.17s]  I can say I kind of like this video
[9542.60s -> 9546.56s]  This this ain't bad this one's not bad
[9547.20s -> 9554.08s]  How do you guys feel right now?
[9554.08s -> 9557.04s]  Like this very second if I asked you and I had a piece of paper and I wrote it down
[9557.52s -> 9563.90s]  How do you feel good chill groovy?
[9565.38s -> 9569.69s]  Stimulated. Yep mind controlled
[9577.21s -> 9580.81s]  Hungry
[9580.81s -> 9586.52s]  How long does this go for?
[9586.52s -> 9588.52s]  Oh my it's just it's this for 20 minutes
[9589.08s -> 9598.01s]  Does the song change?
[9598.01s -> 9607.87s]  Don't spoil the video
[9607.87s -> 9609.56s]  Somebody just came in
[9609.56s -> 9612.84s]  and said
[9612.84s -> 9616.84s]  Dude, what do we do here? Is this guy just opening up and watching baby videos?
[9620.51s -> 9623.31s]  This is exactly what I told you was going to happen
[9624.03s -> 9628.96s]  Oh shit
[9629.04s -> 9630.00s]  No
[9630.00s -> 9634.96s]  What the fuck? Oh, well, is it all right?
[9644.86s -> 9647.39s]  Is it turning on?
[9647.39s -> 9651.23s]  Okay. No, no, it's all right. It's all right
[9651.23s -> 9652.75s]  so anyways
[9652.75s -> 9657.31s]  Uh, that's exactly what I told you. I told you exactly that's what was gonna happen and it exactly did
[9661.61s -> 9666.49s]  Okay, so uh, no, this is not what we do here. This is one of many things that happen on this channel
[9671.07s -> 9683.96s]  You were vibing. All right, let's vibe for another 30 seconds. What's wrong with your lighting? I've been here for two hours
[9685.36s -> 9688.24s]  This is like a lamp. I have that's just right here. It's like a little
[9689.12s -> 9699.55s]  digital lamp thing
[9699.55s -> 9702.27s]  All right, if the next fruit is a banana
[9702.91s -> 9704.67s]  I will add a hundred dollars
[9704.67s -> 9730.11s]  Somebody said oh wow, man. It's a bunch of little dancing fruits just for me. Oh, no. Yeah, it didn't change you, right?
[9731.07s -> 9740.08s]  Uh banana, right?
[9740.08s -> 9758.00s]  I'm not even kidding. This is your worst stream of the year two bad nominations are closed. Oh, yeah
[9768.96s -> 9775.24s]  Uh strawberry. Oh, well, this is your worst stream for next year
[9776.44s -> 9781.24s]  Oh, I see what you're doing. I didn't pre-watch. What are you talking about?
[9781.88s -> 9787.96s]  Holy shit. Wait, this just keep
[9787.96s -> 9796.83s]  Oh, there's banana. Okay. What'd you say? This is one
[9797.15s -> 9801.87s]  Remember, this is this is the first time i've seen you live. Is this what it's always like?
[9801.95s -> 9803.95s]  No, that's you you said what the last person said
[9807.86s -> 9810.44s]  Spoilers. All right. Let me take baby sensory out of the title
[9811.74s -> 9820.48s]  Because I when I all right, there's no more there's no more baby sensory. I'll give you 60 more seconds
[9821.04s -> 9839.92s]  Somebody said put on animal sensory like dogs cats birds. I don't I think the same shit's gonna happen
[9844.17s -> 9850.56s]  Just stand still and stare at the video. No, I mean we I about 7 000 people have already left
[9851.40s -> 9859.29s]  When baby sensory turned on so I don't want to get the rest of you gone
[9861.95s -> 9870.22s]  Okay, let me do this
[9870.22s -> 9872.22s]  the weakest 7 000
[9875.05s -> 9876.99s]  Do master chef
[9876.99s -> 9881.80s]  No, you've seen it a million times you've seen that a million times
[9885.02s -> 9889.71s]  So let me let me get this out of the way first if you came for the you laugh you lose
[9890.96s -> 9892.96s]  I've never done that before it was really fun
[9893.96s -> 9896.36s]  Uh, i'm gonna update this because there was at least a few more
[9897.92s -> 9901.07s]  so
[9901.07s -> 9902.81s]  That takes us to
[9902.81s -> 9905.21s]  3,500 dollars
[9905.21s -> 9916.49s]  This is not a beginner germa stream. Well, this is a react andy for three hours stream. I'm gonna i'll be left tomorrow though
[9916.73s -> 9922.04s]  This is not just a one stream here this week. I'll be left tomorrow
[9923.45s -> 9925.85s]  All right, so 3,500 dollars is going to go
[9926.99s -> 9930.83s]  Uh to the I think I want to send it to the that science center nevada
[9935.04s -> 9939.36s]  So I will be able to have uh, if you remember from the bugleberry hot tub stream
[9940.30s -> 9946.44s]  There was about I think 7 500 bucks came in so to science center nevada
[9947.23s -> 9950.04s]  That actually makes it perfect
[9950.04s -> 9957.72s]  Because that would be well, i'll just round it out. That'd be five. I was gonna do 5 000 to science center
[9958.56s -> 9960.32s]  So then plus 3,500
[9960.32s -> 9964.59s]  So here's what i'll here's what i'm gonna do i'm gonna send
[9966.23s -> 9971.61s]  $10,000 to the nevada science center to kind of make sure that was combined with the other one, too
[9973.40s -> 9976.44s]  So that is going to go to the their center
[9978.11s -> 9991.58s]  I'm really really can't wait to send that so it'll be 11k. Well, I was gonna round out from the bugleberry stuff
[9991.98s -> 9996.40s]  Somebody said i'm an oaf. I know it's your hardship, but
[9996.96s -> 10000.88s]  I want to can you fund my interest in yo-yos? Why did I read that comment?
[10004.44s -> 10010.27s]  Well, I had a good time I I knew this wasn't going to last very long and especially when baby sensory is like
[10010.75s -> 10024.33s]  That takes a turn off the road and I'm no not gonna have him. He's a philanthropist. Well, I here's the thing I promised
[10025.05s -> 10027.93s]  Back in like july or august or something
[10028.49s -> 10031.77s]  That um that money was actually going to get used and sent to these places
[10031.77s -> 10045.05s]  So want to get that in there? What if you did a yo-yo trick stop with the yo what's with the yo-yos?
[10052.56s -> 10059.34s]  All right, that's it. I'll see you guys tomorrow. I could pivot to monster rancher, but
[10060.78s -> 10064.81s]  I'd rather just do a whole day of it tomorrow because I think we're pretty much near the end
[10066.96s -> 10072.24s]  Let me let me let me type this so people know the final. So it'd be 35
[10072.96s -> 10086.51s]  No, no, you say yeah, you're right. So it'd be it'd be 11.5. It's dirt. Yeah, because I was gonna do five
[10087.74s -> 10093.18s]  And then oh, no, I'll split it. I'll send some to another place, too
[10093.90s -> 10095.66s]  I was gonna do one of the um
[10095.66s -> 10108.67s]  Humane societies out here. All right. There you go
[10114.30s -> 10117.34s]  Uh 10 000 bucks to the science center in nevada nevada science center
[10118.09s -> 10122.73s]  If you don't know who that is and you're wondering why uh, you might be if you're a new viewer or not
[10123.52s -> 10129.37s]  They helped out to do the geology archaeology stream and they were really really really nice people
[10129.85s -> 10143.13s]  So hopefully they can use it for something cool. Oh, I need an end and that'll wrap up today
[10143.13s -> 10145.10s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow
[10145.10s -> 10148.06s]  I'll do a full probably six plus hours of monster rancher tomorrow
[10148.62s -> 10151.58s]  And then what happened when we were adding no more monster rancher, what am I gonna do?
[10153.10s -> 10161.74s]  That's been my game for like two or three weeks. I have to find something else to do. I'm gonna go watch baby sensory
[10165.61s -> 10172.22s]  What you guys bet you guys bet earlier over or under 5 000. Oh man. Okay
[10177.77s -> 10182.19s]  Now have a great night. I'll see you guys tomorrow. There were a lot of gifted subs, too
[10192.36s -> 10198.03s]  I appreciate it. Thank you guys a lot. That was more fun than I will I
[10198.59s -> 10200.03s]  That was more fun than I thought
[10200.03s -> 10204.16s]  I think the next time I would want to do it
[10204.16s -> 10208.08s]  I would want to if if I was going to spend more than two three hours for doing that
[10209.21s -> 10212.09s]  Most of these compilations people kind of do it for like an hour, right?
[10217.15s -> 10226.27s]  All right. Yeah, hope you had a good time. I did have a wonderful rest of the night. Thanks everybody. See you tomorrow
[10226.99s -> 10237.16s]  Monster rancher two have a great night. Sorry. I screamed at you earlier, too. Just trying to scare you
[10237.40s -> 10246.09s]  I'll see you tomorrow put sensory on the credits
[10248.14s -> 10250.03s]  No
[10250.03s -> 10264.64s]  It wasn't actually scary. Yeah, I know I was messing around. I was just having fun. All right, go say hello to nianers
[10268.28s -> 10285.82s]  What is what is what you doing? Let's take a look. Okay, let me get it going first of all
