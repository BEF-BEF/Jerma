[1.46s -> 11.06s]  Hello, good afternoon. How have you been? I'm on a mystery stream today.
[11.06s -> 21.98s]  I don't know, can you hear my Xbox in the background? I can. This looks like a spaceship.
[25.50s -> 32.10s]  The mystery stream is Viva Pinata for the Xbox 360. Mystery stream!
[34.94s -> 40.38s]  Only going to be live for a few hours today. I got a lot of stuff to do today into this weekend,
[41.10s -> 46.30s]  so I gotta get on it. But I did want to stream because I like streaming.
[48.02s -> 53.06s]  I had the demo disc. Well, let's see if the demo is as good as the real game.
[53.86s -> 119.03s]  I'll just tweet this out. I'll be right back. Okay. Also, I'm gonna be really honest.
[119.99s -> 126.98s]  I have no idea what this game is. I was gonna play it until I get bored. I've never played it.
[126.98s -> 134.52s]  I know this is one of the most beloved new, rare franchises, right? I don't even know what it is.
[135.40s -> 143.46s]  Every commercial I ever saw was just pinata animals walking around and you feed them candy
[144.66s -> 153.30s]  right up my alley. So I got them. I got them all. I have every... Don't ask me why I do these things,
[154.18s -> 163.91s]  but I own every Viva Pinata game. I don't know why. I just do. What if we get bored?
[165.32s -> 179.13s]  Well, read a book. Why? Because when I was buying them, they were like $3 each. These were not more
[179.13s -> 192.31s]  than like $2 to $4 each. It's not like I spent a lot of money on these games. But I got a few
[192.31s -> 202.66s]  hours, so I figured let's throw in Viva Pinata. Viva Pinata! Here it comes. Oh, no, no, no, no. I
[202.66s -> 206.02s]  don't wanna get spoiled. Look, there's like little snakes and stuff. This is gonna be great.
[206.90s -> 217.80s]  Do you get to pick the animal? This game is my childhood. I know it's like... Look, we're on
[217.80s -> 223.80s]  childhood week. Chibi-Robo. Holy fuck, that was incredible. What an amazing game. That's my
[223.80s -> 230.28s]  childhood. Viva Pinata. This is my childhood, Jerma. Cooking Mama. That was my childhood,
[230.28s -> 239.51s]  Jerma. I played them all. I was very good at chopping. This is childhood week. Are we ready?
[239.51s -> 246.46s]  I'm just gonna go. No Viva Pinata save game profile has been found. Do you want to create one?
[246.46s -> 260.34s]  Of course I do. Oh, no, no, no. I don't want him to see. Hello. Yes. Sign in successful. Welcome
[260.34s -> 266.42s]  to Viva Pinata. Warning. Viva Pinata uses an auto-save feature. And removing an Xbox 360
[266.42s -> 272.18s]  memory unit or powering down your 360 while that-ish displayed can result in loss of your data.
[272.18s -> 277.14s]  Additionally, removing an Xbox 360 memory unit at any time will return into the title screen.
[279.80s -> 285.56s]  All right. I thought that was a Wii mode. All right. Learn about online safeguards. Why would
[285.56s -> 296.41s]  I do that? I want to play a garden, right? That's all I can do. New garden. You make a garden?
[300.86s -> 305.74s]  Enter a name for your garden. It's gonna be secret. I want this to be a secret.
[305.74s -> 348.17s]  All right. Yeah. You guys are gonna laugh. It's good. It's good suggestions. I'm seeing
[348.17s -> 359.56s]  there. Yes. Put it on the hard drive. That was your joke. That wasn't mine. You guys have-
[359.56s -> 365.48s]  That was your joke. You guys all wrote that and I was taking your suggestions. So what-
[365.48s -> 370.47s]  Mine is to yourself. I'm just- I'm a man of the people. All right. Let's go in the garden.
[375.86s -> 383.51s]  Deeds. Stop showing my fucking name. I- You get to pick what animal you- I get to be-
[383.51s -> 389.42s]  Set for Viva Piñata, an ever-changing world full of endless possibilities.
[389.42s -> 393.02s]  Really? Because this is a world where you get to call the shots.
[393.02s -> 399.02s]  Yeah. The piñata creatures and plant life that inhabit this land are all determined by you.
[399.02s -> 404.30s]  From the minute you dig your first hole and plant your first seed, go well on your way to
[404.30s -> 410.06s]  attracting your first piñata visitors. If they like what they see, these piñatas may-
[410.06s -> 418.30s]  Piñata frog? Oh my god. As your piñata collection grows, you can choose which to collect
[418.30s -> 424.30s]  and which to train. Life on Piñata Island is never all daisies and apertures. When illness
[424.30s -> 427.90s]  or danger threatens, you'll need to be the one who comes to the rescue.
[427.90s -> 436.49s]  What? You can fight? YouTuber voice. He's a narrator.
[447.22s -> 452.10s]  This is called presenting. Of course, it's going to be like an E3 voice. It's a guy presenting a
[452.10s -> 465.90s]  video. Does this like- Do I have to clean all this up? Wow. More cleaning. I love it already.
[466.54s -> 478.62s]  That's all we do on this stream now. It's clean. All right. So I move around with the left stick.
[480.92s -> 485.00s]  Talk. To Leifos. Oh, hello. I was hoping someone would come and help.
[485.56s -> 489.08s]  I was hoping someone would come and help and tidy up this mess.
[490.04s -> 495.69s]  You must be the new owner. I'm Leifos and I'm here to help you.
[496.25s -> 502.06s]  All right. Tutorial. Is she a piñata? Everything's a piñata here, right?
[502.94s -> 516.31s]  Why do I feel like this is a Kinect game that I don't have the Kinect on? What was that?
[516.31s -> 521.43s]  I've given you the journal. When you finish talking to me, press X to open the menu.
[521.43s -> 526.95s]  All right. Then I'll tell you what to try next. Cool. Oh, I can't wait for this kids game.
[528.18s -> 538.33s]  All right. We're done. So now we have- Welcome to the menu. Close this alert with A and then
[538.33s -> 543.05s]  you can move the left stick and the leaf in the middle will point to the different things that
[543.05s -> 551.08s]  you can do. Point the leaf at the journal, then select it with A. Oh, okay. I don't. I don't.
[551.64s -> 563.16s]  This is the journal. It stores all the information that you discover when you are playing the game.
[563.16s -> 568.28s]  The journal is split up into different parts to make it easier to find what you need.
[568.28s -> 573.48s]  It works just like the menu. There's not much to see yet. So have a quick look and let's get
[573.48s -> 580.70s]  back to the garden. Okay. Let's get back to the garden. All right. Good. Louder? Why would I make
[580.70s -> 591.99s]  it louder than this? Oh, garden area, encyclopedia, how to, player awards. I mean, we can- what's this?
[591.99s -> 597.27s]  Encyclopedia? This just shows characters, garden constructions. We don't need any of this info.
[598.07s -> 604.15s]  I know what I'm doing. Point and laugh at funny creature that walks into screen. I already know.
[617.48s -> 631.62s]  Down there. Is that a mask or is that her face? Alerts explanation.
[632.42s -> 636.66s]  Alerts will wait down here. This is pretty cool. This is a Zelda character. This is a cool
[636.66s -> 642.90s]  Zelda character. The alert will open automatically. If you have more than one alert, you can choose
[642.90s -> 648.34s]  which one to open by moving the cursor over alerts with the left stick. Okay. When you finish with
[648.34s -> 655.46s]  the alert bar, press up on the D pad to put the cursor back into the garden. Cool. Time for another
[655.46s -> 668.30s]  present. It's something you can't manage without. An animal. An animal. A broken shovel.
[668.30s -> 677.74s]  You can't- you can't afford a regular shovel? Grab your shovel from the menu and turn this mess
[677.74s -> 683.10s]  into your dream garden. This is not going to work. Why are there bite marks?
[686.86s -> 692.10s]  Why are there bite marks in the shovel? You have to start from the bottom, friend.
[692.58s -> 699.91s]  Well okay. Menu. There's the shovel. The buttons in the top right of the screen tell you what you
[699.91s -> 706.63s]  can do with the shovel. I have three bits of advice. One, you can clear the hard soil more
[706.63s -> 713.99s]  quickly if you hold down A. Two, the shovel is old but it won't break. And three, if you hit
[713.99s -> 719.37s]  pinatas, they can become ill. If you'd like more advice- Wait, don't hit any pinatas with a shovel?
[722.62s -> 729.29s]  So this is one, you can clear hard soil more quickly. Two, the shovel is old but it won't break.
[729.29s -> 757.38s]  Three, don't hit animals. Okay, don't hit animals with shovel. Oh! Oh my god, it's perfect.
[757.38s -> 772.89s]  Oh my god, it's a perfect game. Oh my god, it's a perfect game. Chocolate? What's that little thing?
[772.89s -> 779.93s]  Worm? Worm.
[779.93s -> 785.05s]  Well done. You attracted a worm. The worm has turned up because you have-
[785.05s -> 797.11s]  Crush. I'm not gonna crush the worm. Worm first sighting. Well, where is he? All right, smash the
[797.11s -> 813.03s]  junk. Smash it. Money. Explanation. Do I need to- do I really need to explain what money is?
[813.83s -> 827.16s]  Where's the worm? Is this a mobile game? No. Sorry, this predates mobile games. This is what
[827.16s -> 835.50s]  mobile games wish they were. In fact, this is what mobile games exploit. All right, pick up the
[835.50s -> 845.06s]  money. How do I get the money? Mobile games took this idea and removed the actual video game from
[845.06s -> 854.41s]  it. Where are the pinatas? I don't know. You have a new worm visitor. Where is he?
[854.89s -> 865.21s]  The new one needs. If there's a big enough patch of soil or grass, it will want to visit.
[865.21s -> 880.17s]  Oh, all right. Oh, I got grass? I have to attract pinatas. But where's my like pinata attraction
[880.17s -> 895.42s]  spray? Then press X for the menu. Choose your new grass seed packet from there. Okay, let's- no spray.
[896.74s -> 901.06s]  Well, I'm going to clear this whole thing first, right? I don't want to leave any trash. They're
[901.06s -> 914.26s]  not going to like this. How big is my area? Okay, I got into the white line there. Did I
[914.26s -> 926.12s]  just become a Viva pinata streamer? I may have. It depends. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Don't hit.
[926.68s -> 939.08s]  No, get out of the way. Get out of the way. I don't want to hurt you. Whack pinata. Poke pinata.
[939.80s -> 950.31s]  Is that health? Wait, why can I do this? Why can I golf swing?
[955.72s -> 959.40s]  I don't know. That's my first friend. Do you think I'm going to kill my first friend? What
[959.40s -> 964.44s]  are you guys crazy? I want to clear this. There's so much- look at all this trash.
[975.34s -> 987.11s]  Kill. Chat's the psycho now. Yeah, you guys calling me a psycho. All right. Yeah, this is easier.
[987.11s -> 999.74s]  Just hold it down. Clear it all. Hey, do I get to expand? I get to pay money and expand, right?
[1000.46s -> 1013.66s]  All right. How's that? That's not bad. I have to plant grass. You missed a spot, did I? Where? No,
[1013.66s -> 1033.26s]  I didn't. No, I didn't. People- right there? Where? People coming in from stir? Hi, guys.
[1034.74s -> 1044.09s]  We're playing an intense game called Viva Pinata. There's a ton- there's a shitload of blood in this
[1044.09s -> 1052.65s]  game. You're going to want to stick around. Yeah, in the settings, there was a gore setting and I
[1052.65s -> 1069.43s]  kept it on. All right. Am I wasting time or is this actually what I'm supposed to be doing?
[1069.43s -> 1073.51s]  Am I- I should just do this, right? Just get it over with? Am I going to have all grass? This is
[1073.51s -> 1089.40s]  a problem. Am I doing this wrong? Because if- I don't just want the field of grass. Okay, I just
[1089.40s -> 1107.29s]  broke the dog house. The dog house is gone. I'm just leveling everything. Don't hit the slug. All
[1107.29s -> 1124.97s]  right. How do I get the slug to move? Move. Move. Move. Move. You're taking up all- I need to clear
[1124.97s -> 1135.50s]  that. Hold on, there's some spots that I missed. I can't- can I get them? All right, we're good.
[1135.50s -> 1144.63s]  Let's plant some grass. What should I plant it just down? We'll start at the front. All right.
[1145.27s -> 1153.66s]  Grass packet. The grass seed packet is simple to use. Press A to go back to the game and look at
[1153.66s -> 1158.30s]  the buttons in the top right of the screen. They'll tell you what to do with the packet.
[1158.86s -> 1163.32s]  If you'd like to know more, press 1 now. Let's plant the whole thing. I mean, I- it's grass.
[1163.88s -> 1166.86s]  All right, start pouring. Start pouring.
[1180.39s -> 1202.04s]  He loves it. Get over there. Are you angry? Oh, here comes a snake. That snake looks like Otto.
[1209.34s -> 1218.38s]  Oh, okay. The orange means resident?
[1218.38s -> 1223.98s]  Resident. Name the new resident. Okay.
[1232.60s -> 1245.64s]  What's the- what's the name? Wait, let me get some more- does this cost money? Oh shit, there's
[1245.64s -> 1254.20s]  another one! This doesn't even cost money? Those who said this was a mobile game, now you know it's
[1254.20s -> 1263.64s]  not. What I just did right here would have taken three to five days and probably fifteen dollars.
[1263.64s -> 1271.11s]  All right, come here. Worm 1. Well, that's not your name.
[1275.83s -> 1276.71s]  Weeks, you mean.
[1284.33s -> 1291.53s]  Okay, but I want to name this worm. Name. No, direct? Oh, I can tell him to go. All right,
[1291.61s -> 1298.33s]  information. You can get information on almost anything by putting the cursor on it and pressing
[1298.33s -> 1306.34s]  Y. Let's have some fun. Have some fun. Oh, nice. Then press the left stick to select basic info.
[1306.34s -> 1312.34s]  Comic Sans. Now you can change your pinata's name, which helps you to find it in the garden
[1312.34s -> 1324.10s]  and keep track of its pinata life. Name it Harvey? Name him Bait. I have ten- okay.
[1324.82s -> 1333.99s]  Romance requirements. One out of two. Condition status. All right, let's have ten square
[1334.63s -> 1339.59s]  pinometers of soil or grass. What the hell is that? There's a worm house in the garden.
[1339.59s -> 1351.32s]  Nope, not yet. All right, let's name him. Basic info. Age zero days. Travel- what is-
[1352.04s -> 1365.93s]  Worma. Hold on. What do I want to name him? Uh, Worma? No, that's so easy.
[1366.73s -> 1381.43s]  Worma or else. Oh my god. Fine, fine, fine, fine. There's gonna be like a hundred of these.
[1382.15s -> 1388.81s]  Should it be Worma 1? There's gonna be a dozen of these. We'll run around.
[1389.37s -> 1403.99s]  Ooh, I got an achievement. Okay, cool. Let's go back. Can I pick more grass? There's another one.
[1404.55s -> 1415.94s]  All right, so this is- this is via pinata. There's no point in this game
[1416.82s -> 1420.98s]  where they- they hang from a ceiling and you hit them with baseball bats, right? That doesn't
[1421.06s -> 1435.11s]  happen. That doesn't happen, right? I shouldn't be preparing for that. It does. I mean, it's called
[1435.11s -> 1440.76s]  pinata. Do- do they actually like hang from a string on the ceiling and you go with like a pool
[1440.76s -> 1455.18s]  cue and smash them? No, okay. You've attracted a sparrow mid. Sparrow mids can hear a worm wiggling
[1455.18s -> 1464.47s]  from miles away and will come to take a look. Are they gonna get scooped up? Wait, another one?
[1466.89s -> 1475.37s]  Come check out the grass. Look. Yeah. How do you like it? Do you love it? Do you love it here?
[1476.84s -> 1495.32s]  Do you love it here? Where's your best friend, Snuffleufagus? Who's this? Willy? Uh, just some
[1495.32s -> 1501.53s]  normal guy. Thanks to the five community subs. Thanks a lot. Uh, I'm Willy the- so where's the
[1501.53s -> 1506.49s]  voice acting? So you're the new owner. Pleased to meet you. I'm Willy Builder and I put up all
[1506.49s -> 1512.89s]  the buildings around here. I can see you have two warmas as residents. You'll probably need a few
[1512.89s -> 1519.05s]  more. All pinata need a house before they will romance. Since you're new here, I'll build you
[1519.05s -> 1525.26s]  a worm house on the house. Close this alert and show me where to put the building site. If you'd
[1525.26s -> 1530.70s]  like some advice on how to choose a site, press Y now. All right, I need to know this. Seems
[1530.70s -> 1537.24s]  important. You want to build a house, the cursor changes to carry the building site. Move around
[1537.24s -> 1541.16s]  the garden to find a good spot. You can't put it down if there isn't real more analog objects in
[1541.16s -> 1548.78s]  the way. Okay. Spin it around with X to spin the site. Hold it and left stick you can spin it even
[1548.78s -> 1558.38s]  more. All right. Just put a block on the ground. I- yeah, but I mean I didn't- this is a huge house!
[1559.56s -> 1572.04s]  Oh my- Jesus! This is for a worm? This is bigger than some apartments. Well, how can I tell where
[1572.12s -> 1581.61s]  the entrance is? I need grass over there. It's as far in the corner as I can get it.
[1582.17s -> 1603.11s]  Is it going? Holy shit, this place sucks. All right, I need grass. I want to put more grass.
[1604.39s -> 1609.58s]  Award for having a sparrow visit. All right, we need grass.
[1614.06s -> 1614.86s]  I can't see the line.
[1621.74s -> 1625.26s]  Oh, he comes and builds it, I was gonna say. This is a terrible house.
[1627.34s -> 1645.13s]  Oh, there he is. Oh, he has a hammer for a head. You're making it out of skin.
[1650.84s -> 1657.34s]  New visitor. Oh, here comes a snake. There's a sparrow. I see it. I see it. It's over there.
[1661.75s -> 1663.99s]  Do they eat each other? They don't eat each other, right?
[1675.46s -> 1676.18s]  All right, what happened?
[1685.42s -> 1692.87s]  Wake. Okay, let's smash the building. Where do you stand back? I don't want any splinters.
[1702.87s -> 1704.31s]  You mean a McDonald's play place?
[1716.66s -> 1727.21s]  Okay, so put the cursor over the worms. Hey, that's not your house. Get off.
[1728.17s -> 1739.42s]  Do not your house. Okay, select. Now that you have the cursor on a worm, close this alert.
[1740.94s -> 1746.79s]  All right, we're on two and Wormo. Wait, we need, hold on. I told you this was gonna happen.
[1747.82s -> 1761.88s]  I knew this was gonna happen. Just different versions of Wormet, Wormo, Worma, Worma,
[1779.78s -> 1788.34s]  Worma and Worma. Okay, Worma and Worma.
[1800.22s -> 1804.54s]  Okay, Worma and Worma. The snake is coming over here.
[1815.98s -> 1840.89s]  Okay, secrets. Okay, they're in love. Are they gonna have worm babies?
[1849.77s -> 1855.77s]  Poor minigame.
[1860.97s -> 1889.59s]  Okay, let's go. So I have to get from here to there. Come get me. I will. Oh, he didn't even
[1889.59s -> 1905.70s]  get the fucking secret coin. All right, goodbye. Well, one of you seems to be more excited
[1905.70s -> 1930.26s]  than the other. All right. Yeah, let's make some more grass. Grass time. Wait, and you have to
[1930.26s -> 1964.46s]  watch them. For kids, this is how, this is how these babies are born. Oh, a new piñata. Oh, it's
[1964.46s -> 1975.38s]  Storkos. Your piñatas have made an egg. Your piñatas have done the romance dance. A new baby
[1975.38s -> 1987.72s]  piñata is brought to the garden, safely packed in a patterned egg. Welcome to kids week. Welcome
[1987.72s -> 2001.42s]  to kids week, guys. Let me just get enough grass. Missed a spot. I can, I'll fill it in.
[2006.63s -> 2010.63s]  Oh, right. I have to, I know there's a spot right here. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. I'll get it. I'll
[2010.63s -> 2025.38s]  get it. I'll get it. Wink. All right. Your egg's been delivered safely. Can they not be delivered
[2025.38s -> 2045.00s]  safely? Oh, there's an egg. Hey, smash the egg. You can change your label by using the label designer
[2045.00s -> 2060.28s]  from the main menu. Wait, I can make like a Call of Duty emblem? Yeah. Hold on. I gotta,
[2060.28s -> 2068.62s]  hold on. Wait, wait, wait. I, let me just plant the grass first. No, no, put it that way.
[2071.86s -> 2076.57s]  Grass. Uh oh.
[2076.89s -> 2082.89s]  Are you looking for romance? What? We need more birds?
[2086.73s -> 2091.94s]  He's burning up in the sun. Get out of the sun. Oh, no, that means he's a resident.
[2098.95s -> 2116.92s]  Oh, there's another one. We're gonna have romance again. Let me do this first. What's going on here?
[2117.88s -> 2125.59s]  Baby piñata is ready to grow up. The baby goes into a cocoon where it grows to its adult side.
[2125.59s -> 2129.03s]  If you get impatient, you could give the cocoon some encouragement with your shovel.
[2130.07s -> 2134.71s]  If you get impatient, you could give the cocoon some encouragement with your shovel.
[2140.55s -> 2148.01s]  That's, that's like things you don't want to hear a mob boss say. Okay. Um,
[2154.28s -> 2167.96s]  there's a spot right here that I can't get. I still have to make my emblem.
[2172.68s -> 2177.88s]  You either live or you die.
[2182.68s -> 2185.72s]  Leave some soil. Don't do the whole thing. Leave some soil.
[2186.52s -> 2189.00s]  All right for the worms. Okay. Well, let's just make it look nice.
[2190.76s -> 2193.56s]  It's a little too, it's a little too rigid. Here, a little patch.
[2195.80s -> 2196.76s]  Just, it looks rigid.
[2199.08s -> 2201.72s]  It's more natural. It's more natural look. Here we go.
[2203.37s -> 2207.37s]  If you've raised a baby worm, I feel like I can really trust you.
[2207.93s -> 2212.01s]  I have two seeds that are ideal for someone starting a new garden.
[2212.01s -> 2217.69s]  You can have either one. Please choose a seed from either hand by moving the left stick.
[2217.69s -> 2222.89s]  All right. What seed do I want to take? The purple pill or the yellow pill?
[2225.86s -> 2235.54s]  Which one of these wakes me up connected to a toaster? This one, right?
[2236.34s -> 2245.85s]  Ah, yes. A good choice. When you get back to the garden, your cursor will be holding the seed.
[2246.41s -> 2252.09s]  You need to plant this type of seed in soil. Look at the buttons displayed in the top right
[2252.09s -> 2256.81s]  of the screen to help you with the seed. Or you can press Y now.
[2256.81s -> 2259.45s]  Now I know. I can plant it. Seed choice. Let's go. Where's it going?
[2260.17s -> 2263.27s]  Where should I plant this? This is important, right?
[2265.69s -> 2273.48s]  Uh, how about over here? Like right over here?
[2273.48s -> 2276.81s]  It's going to go right here, right? It'll make this look nice.
[2296.78s -> 2300.01s]  Okay. So we can water the plants?
[2307.61s -> 2310.41s]  Die.
[2320.89s -> 2337.75s]  Kill. Die. This is a kid's game. You're supposed to say defeat or lose. Destroy. Yeah.
[2338.47s -> 2339.45s]  This thing looks cool.
[2339.45s -> 2348.34s]  Donut. I thought it was a terrier.
[2362.55s -> 2366.12s]  Why is the watering can so dirty?
[2374.30s -> 2375.34s]  I don't need information.
[2376.06s -> 2382.68s]  All right. So here we go. Short pour. Plant is overwatered.
[2384.44s -> 2389.16s]  You just gave it to me. You don't say, here, take the watering can and go water the plant.
[2389.16s -> 2390.04s]  You did too much.
[2401.74s -> 2406.84s]  All right. Get them to romance. Let's see the current status.
[2407.56s -> 2418.47s]  Okay. After two worms have romanced, they are ready. What about you?
[2421.38s -> 2439.08s]  Has eaten one worm. You have to eat one. Who do we eat? Worma? Worma? Or worm? Are you going
[2439.08s -> 2442.81s]  for worm three? Here. Have some food.
[2470.44s -> 2475.80s]  Douse it with water. Whack it with your shovel or keep it away from dinner.
[2488.06s -> 2510.41s]  What? I thought I was just going to eat it. Cheering. It just exploded. A bunny comb.
[2511.05s -> 2518.54s]  Did you see that bunny comb appear? You can smell the carrot?
[2523.82s -> 2532.86s]  Oh, shit. He's eating them. Oh, wait. That was right. That was there.
[2533.90s -> 2537.50s]  He's eating them in front of the parents. This is the last of them.
[2538.30s -> 2545.75s]  All right. Where's the carrot? Have you eaten carrot? Oh, it was a carrot. That's what it was.
[2546.55s -> 2568.60s]  It was a carrot. Okay. Are you ready to breed? A lot of new animals coming in. Well done.
[2571.48s -> 2575.32s]  When the sun goes down, the moth drop will look for a suitable garden.
[2576.60s -> 2592.60s]  Okay. I gotta build some more stuff. They sleep. Okay. Hold on. They sleep. I need to...
[2592.60s -> 2600.98s]  Where's the builder? Label. Oh, yeah. Label designer. Big bits from phylactery lich.
[2602.42s -> 2611.19s]  Holy shit. There was 5,000 bits, actually. 50 more dollars from phylactery. They say,
[2611.19s -> 2614.15s]  Jeremiah, I found this picture of you browsing around last night. Explain yourself.
[2615.03s -> 2618.95s]  Oh, it's the penis shirt. I've shown this. It's the penis shirt thing.
[2620.84s -> 2624.84s]  Four fucking years ago, somebody made this image. I don't know. I'm just showing it on screen.
[2629.37s -> 2634.09s]  It's the penis picture with the smoking camel guy, whatever his name is.
[2634.89s -> 2643.35s]  All right. How do I use this? What am I supposed to say? That's... That was like my first t-shirt
[2643.35s -> 2660.18s]  sale like five years ago. Somebody photo... That's your explanation. No, I'm not gonna show... I've
[2660.18s -> 2673.11s]  shown it already. I've shown it like a thousand times. What is going on right now? Wait, wait.
[2673.11s -> 2696.39s]  Customize... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. How do I get like a... Okay. I don't want this. It's gotta
[2696.39s -> 2709.29s]  be... My... It's gotta be like the germa colors, right? Don't randomize the colors. Randomize the
[2709.29s -> 2723.26s]  shapes. No. Here. The castle. The lightning bolt. The octagon. The puzzle piece. I like the puzzle
[2723.26s -> 2729.43s]  piece. The mail. I'm not... I don't want this one because I'll think I'll just... I just have mail.
[2730.23s -> 2735.88s]  I'll just think that this... I have to click on something. The controller. The Xbox controller.
[2744.50s -> 2759.26s]  Gamer land. But seriously, five lakhs for it. Thanks for the fucking thousands of dollars.
[2759.26s -> 2775.61s]  I want to change the colors of the other one. I don't like this purple. Actually, that's fine.
[2776.57s -> 2785.72s]  All right. That's the one I want. And then I want to change this to
[2790.81s -> 2808.42s]  Nickelodeon colors. I'm gonna be too bright. That's fine. I like it. It hurts my eyes. It's good.
[2809.46s -> 2819.14s]  Would you like to save? Yes, I would. Was there a wink? No fucking way. By the way, Tuesday
[2820.10s -> 2823.78s]  is the final day for winks and they're going to be very, very significantly reduced in price.
[2826.38s -> 2848.47s]  Significantly. By a huge amount. All right. How's the flower? Can I water the carrot? What do you
[2848.47s -> 2859.58s]  do at night? Oh, I need to name you guys? Okay. Has eaten what... You've eaten a worm. What are
[2859.58s -> 2866.33s]  you talking about? Was it the wrong person? Oh shit. I think that was the wrong person.
[2866.33s -> 2873.22s]  Wrong bird.
[2877.30s -> 2880.42s]  Some gardeners use their clock to predict which pinata shows up.
[2881.14s -> 2898.18s]  Okay. They both have to eat a worm. Name him Sperma. That would be really funny.
[2898.90s -> 2911.27s]  What's the building menu? Do I have access to it? Journal? I can't. No, all these animals that
[2911.27s -> 2917.61s]  are here right now are going to die. Let's be completely honest. Be upfront with all of this.
[2917.61s -> 2925.42s]  Everybody here. They're all going to get eaten. These birds are going to eat the worms and then
[2925.42s -> 2929.34s]  the snake is going to eat the birds and then the rhino is going to eat the snake.
[2930.50s -> 2944.06s]  And then we end up with our character. That's what happens. What can I do at night? Just hang out?
[2944.62s -> 2958.02s]  Do we just keep the original worms alive and have the... That's so fucked up though.
[2958.82s -> 2970.26s]  We need to have... We need to breed, breed, and breed. All right. Well, how do I get the bunny
[2970.26s -> 2981.66s]  to come over here? Come on. Come on. Why is that universal for any animal to come say hello to you?
[2981.66s -> 2987.14s]  They probably have no idea what the fuck we're talking about. Come here. What are you... What
[2987.14s -> 2997.50s]  are you doing? Oh, listen. Come here. Come on. Get over here. Should I pick it up and give it to him?
[2997.50s -> 3013.83s]  All right. You. You. Let's go. Don't eat him. Hold on. You. Yep. Let's go. Oh, bunny combs.
[3014.47s -> 3019.90s]  It's a bunny. All right. What do you need? Okay. I got a lot of grass. He needs to eat three carrots
[3019.90s -> 3037.74s]  and he'll stay. All right. Let's get some extra money. Where do I get the seeds from? What the
[3037.74s -> 3060.55s]  fuck was that movement? Go. You unlock the seed NPC later. All right. Are you going for the carrot?
[3061.69s -> 3070.68s]  Whatever. You're just going to eat it, I guess. Do you like it? Okay. I need two more of those.
[3071.93s -> 3085.34s]  All right. Cool. Good. Please show Otto I need my endorphins. What are you talking about?
[3086.97s -> 3093.37s]  Here are the experience petals. I need my endorphins. When you do something to help the
[3093.37s -> 3099.69s]  garden, the petals will turn blue. If you'd like some more information about the experience petals,
[3099.69s -> 3114.33s]  press Y or level up experience petals. Where you going? Okay. You've filled the
[3114.33s -> 3121.05s]  pastels around the clock, which means you've taken a step closer to becoming a truly great gardener.
[3122.09s -> 3129.98s]  You shop new items, new pinatas. Good. All right. Level up. Do I pick points?
[3130.94s -> 3136.62s]  You've filled the pastels around the clock, which means you've taken a step closer to becoming a
[3136.62s -> 3144.84s]  truly great gardener. Okay. Level up. You've filled the pastels around the clock. All right.
[3147.26s -> 3155.85s]  Here comes Seedos. I didn't expect the mouse to move. I thought it was a mask. They're not masks.
[3155.85s -> 3159.93s]  These are obsessed with gathering seeds. You should try talking to him.
[3164.98s -> 3182.04s]  All right. Seedos. Egg delivered. All right. There's the egg. Hey, you too. Do it again.
[3182.92s -> 3196.42s]  Pick up the egg. Um, didn't it say I can hit the egg? This game is too cute. It's disgusting.
[3196.98s -> 3216.41s]  All right. I don't care about the coin. I just want children. All right. So put it down.
[3216.41s -> 3248.66s]  Come on. Here it comes. Worm four. He's looking. He's so cute. Yes. I want to talk to you too.
[3248.66s -> 3255.46s]  Come here. Hey, Seedos. What do you got? Hello. I'm Seedos. Take a seed and don't hit me with your
[3255.46s -> 3268.52s]  spade. Don't tell me not to do it. I'm going to do it. Have a seed. Carrots. Let's put it over here.
[3274.34s -> 3295.11s]  Beat his ass. Jesus. All right. Wada. All right. Do not hit him. Worm four. All right. Here comes an egg.
[3296.71s -> 3301.82s]  All right. What just happened? Why did worm four just explode?
[3304.79s -> 3326.82s]  Eat this. Don't you want to eat this? The builder shop is now open. Okay. Good. Okay. My menu. Okay.
[3327.22s -> 3330.18s]  Good. All right. Fine.
[3364.28s -> 3368.20s]  Where's the seed, dude? You said you dropped one. I was just kidding.
[3369.64s -> 3379.64s]  Keep hitting him. No. There's a wink. I get it. Why would I keep hitting the guy that just told
[3379.64s -> 3385.46s]  me he was going to come back and put weeds in my garden if I hit him? All right. It's time. We've
[3385.46s -> 3393.91s]  got to feed. Worm four. Nope. It's all right. It's time to. We need info here. Put this away.
[3396.06s -> 3405.50s]  Okay. How old are they? Age one day old. Okay. So that's not that big of a deal. Call the guy's
[3405.58s -> 3424.20s]  bluff. All right. Sparrow, come here. We need to. You eat a worm. You. Now let's build a birdhouse.
[3428.78s -> 3436.28s]  Willy builder. He wants the worm. You roll a slot machine.
[3436.60s -> 3441.64s]  Established 20 years. Regional award winner for services to island housing.
[3441.64s -> 3448.12s]  You need some work done. Pinata and helper accommodation. A specialty. I know my trade.
[3448.12s -> 3460.73s]  Don't you worry. I have to roll for a building. Buy items. Okay. Sparrow home. Price. 165. Place
[3460.73s -> 3466.73s]  the work shed down where you want the building. Then I can get started. Payment up front though,
[3466.73s -> 3478.60s]  if you please. Why would I not pay you up front? I'm going to keep the birds away from the worms.
[3481.54s -> 3486.09s]  Yeah. I'm going to put them over here. We don't want any fighting.
[3491.67s -> 3495.51s]  If I could just ask you to pay the balance. All right. Didn't I already do that?
[3496.31s -> 3506.87s]  We had a raid come in. Why malicious welcome everybody from why malicious is a
[3507.83s -> 3516.36s]  raid playing pinata. The game's fucked up. It likes flowers. Any kind. That's all I got.
[3517.48s -> 3532.54s]  That's all I got. Here's a taffy. It likes flowers. Any kind will do a taffy. I think there's
[3532.54s -> 3546.49s]  too many animals to keep track of, but thanks a lot. Welcome guys. Congratulations. You have
[3546.49s -> 3552.57s]  attracted. I already got it. I got it. Sometimes they are attracted by the noises of other animals
[3552.57s -> 3557.98s]  and sometimes the scent of flowers brings them. All right. Flowers and smell.
[3560.70s -> 3568.97s]  How many new characters are there? You should all know my store's open again.
[3568.97s -> 3573.21s]  I expect to see you in here very soon. Just bring lots of cash.
[3574.33s -> 3579.13s]  Nobody likes the taste of chocolate coins more than Lottie, I can tell you. Shop get.
[3579.85s -> 3581.13s]  Okay. All right. Can I?
[3588.49s -> 3593.29s]  They're chocolate coins? It's not even real money.
[3601.21s -> 3608.66s]  Everything is candy. So the currency here, what's the US dollar equivalent? A bag of
[3608.74s -> 3616.42s]  30 of those little chocolate coins is like 80 cents, isn't it? Oh boy. Okay.
[3618.20s -> 3624.68s]  Now cost a loss is open. You can buy romance sweets. If you have romance, the pinata species
[3624.68s -> 3631.40s]  before you could replace all their requirements, except their house with a romance suite. Buy a
[3631.40s -> 3638.68s]  suite and direct a pinata to it. They should eat it and instantly they will have to show they are
[3638.68s -> 3644.52s]  ready to romance. This should make romancing pinata easier. You need to feed pinatas.
[3647.16s -> 3654.22s]  Romance candies. All right. Can I open this thing now? Or is there anything else you'd like to
[3654.22s -> 3677.54s]  traffic jam tutorial me with? All right. That's gone. Have you eaten? What about you? You have
[3677.54s -> 3683.64s]  eaten. I need to spare a house and then you need to eat a worm. Don't eat him.
[3692.20s -> 3697.59s]  The happy meter tells you about your pinata's mood. Every time something happens to the pinata,
[3697.59s -> 3702.95s]  orange or blue, turn orange or turn blue. The more orange triangles a pinata has,
[3702.95s -> 3708.47s]  the happier it is. And you can see this on the face in the middle. Okay. Let's see. How happy are you?
[3710.22s -> 3731.10s]  You're all right. Eat. Who is this? Worm five. Eat worm five. Go for it. This is sad. Wait,
[3731.10s -> 3736.22s]  is the snake going to come over and get free candy? Look at the snake. What does the snake eat?
[3737.74s -> 3761.82s]  No, no. That was your brother. Oh, okay. Well, what does the snake need? It needs to eat a mouse
[3761.82s -> 3782.30s]  mallow. You got it. All right. Open it up. They will now live here. Oh, that was horrible. All
[3782.30s -> 3792.38s]  right. There you go, guys. We need more breeding. Okay. I'm going to make another worm. Should I
[3792.94s -> 3818.50s]  make another worm discovery zone? Should I do that? No. I need another egg. We need to have a
[3818.50s -> 3830.42s]  ton of worms because there's going to be a bunch of sparrows. The dumb birds won't even sleep in
[3830.42s -> 3853.70s]  the bed. Oh, no. He's going to die. Screamer sucks at kids' games. It's not a kids' game.
[3853.78s -> 3864.57s]  I keep getting corrected. Builder back at the store. All right.
[3864.57s -> 3871.67s]  Pretz tail? There's so many animals.
[3882.31s -> 3889.77s]  Bro, you're fucked. What? Is a pretz tail going to... What's wrong with the pretz tail?
[3892.90s -> 3904.04s]  Wait. Oh, I got to water this. I need to buy some seeds too. More?
[3904.04s -> 3926.07s]  Good. More? Kill the pretz tail. You're not selecting it. Make those birds have sex. I will.
[3926.07s -> 3948.42s]  I'm going to buy some seeds. Oh, was it an onion? It's a mystery seed. All right. We're going to
[3948.42s -> 3957.29s]  put plants over here. Put it right here. The egg. Oh, I don't know why I thought that eggs were
[3957.29s -> 3968.47s]  going to grow on that. Okay. Talk more? Come on. I can't leave. I'm confined to this space. What is it?
[3977.56s -> 3984.17s]  Big one. All right. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop,
[3984.17s -> 3999.05s]  pouring. Where do I get water? Hold on. There's a... Come on, get in here. I'm going to get this big
[3999.93s -> 4005.62s]  monarch butterfly, whatever it is. Get in here. All right. What do you want? How do I get you to
[4005.62s -> 4017.26s]  stay? You're beautiful. Has a light in the garden. Oh, I need a light. I need a lamp. Build me a lamp.
[4031.94s -> 4037.18s]  Stop ad-libbing, Jerma. Don't ad-lib. Read the script. Case in point, what you just saw right
[4037.18s -> 4047.27s]  there. There's no, I can't do one yet. Can I buy from the other store?
[4057.08s -> 4058.36s]  From this store here?
[4061.75s -> 4067.91s]  If it isn't the new gardener in town, you're guaranteed a warm welcome at Costalot's store.
[4067.91s -> 4073.35s]  Whether you're here to buy or sell, which will it be today? It's sell. Highlight and select one and
[4073.35s -> 4083.40s]  let's get those coins flowing. Happy shopping. All right. What we got? Buy items, seeds, candy,
[4083.40s -> 4093.70s]  vegetables, fence, lamp, firebrand. That's a lamp, right? Give me that lamp.
[4099.67s -> 4107.88s]  All right. I'm going to put it right over here. Right here. Hey, look what I got.

[4144.30s -> 4155.27s]  no, I don't want the birds to start having kids. The more birds that, why they don't have a tag?
[4155.27s -> 4162.55s]  If there's a bunch of bird kids, they're going to eat. Sell them. You can sell the kids. What?
[4165.56s -> 4184.60s]  We need more worms first. I'm not comfortable having three birds. Okay, here comes another one.
[4193.40s -> 4203.27s]  They don't need to eat. They only have to eat if you want to breed them. Oh, well, there's going to
[4203.27s -> 4211.29s]  be, all right. Well, they'll be, they're going to be quite a few of these. All right. You two,
[4211.29s -> 4227.99s]  it's time to make a bird child. You, come here. Where's the other one? Come on, stop going out.

[4263.94s -> 4269.46s]  There's nothing more valuable than a seed.
[4272.09s -> 4285.11s]  Me? Thank you. And put it right here. Hey, you, come here. Talk to me again.
[4285.99s -> 4291.35s]  All the seeds are mine, but I'm kind so other people can borrow them.
[4292.73s -> 4307.94s]  Me another one? Oh man, he's throwing them out like crazy. Wait, what? Hold on. What, what does
[4307.94s -> 4321.29s]  this weird elephant be? Hold on. What the hell are you? A taffy has eaten one flower. So the
[4321.29s -> 4338.81s]  taffy wants to live here now. How do I make it? This thing's cool. That is really cute. Yeah,
[4338.81s -> 4346.57s]  I like this thing. Okay. So now what? Has eaten one poppy. I need a taffy house in the garden.
[4347.37s -> 4350.76s]  I'm thinking, do I have any poppies? So this is a carrot, right?
[4350.76s -> 4384.71s]  Okay. Nice. What about this? Are these two both carrots? Don't eat that. Hey. All right. Do they
[4384.71s -> 4402.87s]  have a kid yet? Look inside. You can go into the house. This is kind of cool. You can just say,
[4402.87s -> 4415.74s]  put your eye up and look. All right. How's everybody doing? Lots of worm kids. Still need
[4415.74s -> 4424.50s]  to find out how to get you here. I need you guys to read. I need the bunny to come back.
[4424.50s -> 4435.34s]  Come here. Breed. I can't select you. If you're just going to stand up on top there.
[4435.98s -> 4445.32s]  Do I just make sure? I'm just going to give him a breed candy. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Look inside.
[4445.96s -> 4470.34s]  Oh, that was cute. All right. Can we? He's eating another flower.
[4472.23s -> 4479.77s]  Don't eat that. Not yet. I need more flowers. Have to fly, fly into the fire and he'll turn into a
[4479.77s -> 4493.30s]  new... Can I make him do that? Wait, have him fly into the fire. Why would I do that?
[4494.26s -> 4502.12s]  Is that like a huge spoiler for the game? Oh, I thought you guys were just being dicks.
[4502.84s -> 4519.13s]  I'm not doing that yet. I'm not doing that yet. I want to go buy some more stuff.
[4520.01s -> 4532.42s]  Well, can I make it more buildings? Afternoon, come on in. Big spenders welcome. All right.
[4532.42s -> 4539.58s]  Fertilizer, seeds, paving, fences, garden items, produce, vegetables. How much money do I have?
[4542.65s -> 4549.93s]  Seeds. Oh, these are cheap. Buttercup, daisy, turnip, carrots. All right. I'm going to buy
[4549.93s -> 4574.26s]  a ton of carrots. Let's put carrots over here. Point two, three. They're cheap. They're really
[4574.26s -> 4593.40s]  cheap. I'm going to have like a whole section. I want that bunny rabbit to come back. Shitload
[4593.40s -> 4609.50s]  of carrots. Okay. That's it. Buttercup, daisy, thistle. All right. I'm going to hold off for
[4609.50s -> 4617.99s]  now. Go back. Produce. I can just buy this shit. Wait, honey. That's a lot of money.
[4618.87s -> 4624.87s]  It's going to be a bunny invasion. Carrot. These are too expensive. Why would I buy these?
[4626.90s -> 4639.72s]  Garden items, pile of leaves, ornamental stones. All right. How about an ornamental stone? All
[4639.72s -> 4648.22s]  right. Ornamental stone is going to go. I just want it. I want it. I want an ornamental stone.
[4648.22s -> 4682.31s]  What's wrong with that? See? Look at how much they love it. Pile of leaves. All right. How about a
[4682.31s -> 4704.04s]  pile of leaves? Pile of leaves is going to go right over here. Good. Okay. Omega Lo, no money.
[4708.68s -> 4723.24s]  I want fun stuff for them to do. This is grass right now. This is just grass. Time to start
[4723.24s -> 4741.21s]  selling your piñatas for money. Sell. I can sell them for 100 bucks? Two snakes. All right. I need
[4741.21s -> 4748.28s]  to make the snakes happy. All right. No, no. I'm not going to do this yet. I don't need to do this.
[4751.27s -> 4753.75s]  So my chocolate coins. Thank you. Come again.
[4758.47s -> 4765.48s]  All right. I got the carrots. I want a bunch of, uh, these all good to go. I've got a seed here.
[4766.12s -> 4773.22s]  A carrot seed. All right. Where are the bunnies? And you?
[4773.86s -> 4787.96s]  Where the? I need a mouse. How do I attract a mouse? Let me know the seed.
[4789.82s -> 4799.59s]  If you like seeds, smile. I don't think you're. I need tall grass. What is this?
[4800.55s -> 4810.58s]  And what is this? The daisy. Is it bloomed? No, it's got to go more than that, right?
[4811.22s -> 4831.86s]  It's only worth $10. It's a dead flower. No, it's not. All right. Should I go to the
[4831.86s -> 4837.78s]  information? It's already grown. All right. Everyone's sleeping in their houses, except
[4837.78s -> 4842.66s]  for the snakes. The snakes just leave during the day. This is looking like a pretty nice little
[4842.66s -> 4863.83s]  ecosystem. What's over here? Oh, look at this place. Oh, butterflies back. I need a butterfly
[4863.83s -> 4877.58s]  containment zone. Ego maniac makes ego system. Quick look in the houses. Oh shit. That's right.
[4877.58s -> 4891.83s]  I don't want to wake them up though. Nice. They need to have some children. You can make
[4891.83s -> 4897.10s]  worms happy if you water them. I don't think that that I don't think that's accurate. Look
[4897.10s -> 4911.99s]  at this. This is a big family in here. It's a sleepover. What's the painting of a squirrel?
[4921.21s -> 4934.98s]  Worma, Worma and Worm 7, Worm 4, Worm 6. All right. Give me those rabbits. I want you to stick
[4934.98s -> 4957.35s]  around. You need to make a little moth house. Hey, Cito, give me the seed now. I'll swap you
[4957.35s -> 4973.03s]  a seed for 10 chocolate coins. This person is weird. Oh yeah. You like it? Yeah. All right.
[4973.03s -> 4987.14s]  I think we have a resident. We do. New resident. Yes. All right. Has eaten one thistle and then a
[4987.14s -> 5000.28s]  mystery. Let's rename this to Jermoff. I would have been so into this when I was younger.
[5004.86s -> 5011.24s]  Imagine coming home from school every day and opening this. Oh, it's so good. It would have
[5011.24s -> 5022.49s]  been so fun. What is this thistle? What are you? Daisy? I need a thistle. Back to the store. That's
[5022.49s -> 5034.07s]  a fox. I need a rabbit. Is the rabbit gone? No. Come on. Where's the rabbit? I need some thistle.
[5039.24s -> 5042.60s]  All right. I'm going to buy like four or five thistles. Put them in the corner.
[5043.32s -> 5051.48s]  The rabbit is resident sleeper. Good morning. Right eyed, bushy tailed, and ready to spend.
[5052.84s -> 5069.21s]  What about fertilizer? Do I just do this? Orange fertilizer? Bonus growth. I don't want to do that
[5069.21s -> 5075.53s]  right now. You know, this could start to get annoying. Yeah, like you every time I open the
[5075.53s -> 5086.74s]  store. No, no, no. Not fertilizer. Seeds. I need thistle down here. All right. The 13 bucks.
[5086.74s -> 5098.57s]  So that's your. He's sleeping. Oh, that's so cute. All right. You're when the thistle is
[5098.57s -> 5113.70s]  going to be over here by the fire because they love this shit. I'm going to do thistle. Nice try.
[5113.70s -> 5117.78s]  Cheapskate. You don't have enough money. You don't have the cash for that. Spend what you do. Okay.
[5117.78s -> 5130.06s]  Finish shopping. All right. Now. No credit or refund. All right. Now it's time to sell some
[5131.50s -> 5131.90s]  children.
[5142.02s -> 5155.22s]  Water these thistles. Very good. Oh, yes. Right this way. The carrot buffet is waiting for you.
[5159.83s -> 5170.86s]  Ew. Funny comb. Has eaten a daisy or has eaten a buttercup? You don't eat carrots? Wait, why
[5170.86s -> 5188.86s]  don't you eat carrots? There's so many carrots. What the fuck is happening? Kind of scary. You
[5188.86s -> 5206.54s]  don't eat carrots? Carrots are the ginger vegetable. This doesn't put pinatas up and you'll
[5206.54s -> 5218.26s]  have to look out for them or they'll be eaten. Somebody has to eat these, right?
[5220.50s -> 5241.48s]  Do you eat carrots? A squazzle. You guys were talking shit about me putting the leaves in
[5241.48s -> 5262.47s]  the stones. Now we've got a squazzle. Are you guys still having kids? Someone warn him please. What?
[5269.56s -> 5292.78s]  The ground is overflowing with worms. All right. We're good. He doesn't know. Pepe left. Pepe left.
[5292.78s -> 5310.15s]  I don't know either. He doesn't know. I don't either. All right. Can we? The birds have to
[5310.15s -> 5321.21s]  breed. Get over here. Bird. Stop perching up so I can't select you if you're up that high. Move.
[5322.09s -> 5346.30s]  The gardening is improving. All right. Move. Get off. Off. Off. Get off. Get off. Out. Whoa.
[5346.94s -> 5363.10s]  There's a bunny spider? A raise ant. That thing's crazy. The longer you work in the... Oh no. People
[5363.10s -> 5379.13s]  of far and wide are hearing about how awesome the garden is. Okay. We got... Look. Another one.
[5381.53s -> 5389.72s]  Another one. Keep eating. Eat as much as you want. All right. Now give me this. What is that thing?
[5390.28s -> 5415.34s]  Sour Shelly bean. It eats seeds? Why does he look evil? A seed feast? So a hit with shovel.
[5419.66s -> 5420.30s]  What is going on?
[5425.58s -> 5427.50s]  Ha, ha, ha.
[5487.80s -> 5503.94s]  Okay. I'm sorry. It's a seed feast. All right. Where is he? Oh. A new resident. All right. Give
[5503.94s -> 5509.78s]  me my shovel. We're gonna hit this thing right in the face. Come on over here. Why don't you come
[5509.78s -> 5530.52s]  over here? Come on. Oh, I want you over here too. Look at this. All right. I have children. No.
[5530.52s -> 5545.59s]  You're always so far away from each other. Yep. Go over here. Throw it in the fire. I want you to
[5545.59s -> 5554.70s]  get down. I'm trying to breed. I am. I have children. I'm... More worms. I think I have enough
[5554.70s -> 5587.78s]  worms. What is this? Oh. Fanny Franker? This is a base for a mailbox? What? Well, this doesn't
[5587.78s -> 5617.43s]  exist anymore. Another cocoon hatched. Good. More worms. Okay. This is... I'm done with worms after
[5617.43s -> 5622.31s]  this and I'm going to do everything I can possible to get those sparrows. You're not worming your...
[5622.31s -> 5639.10s]  Oh, there's a hand. I'm so sick of this worm minigame. All right. Finally. Land. You and you
[5640.06s -> 5671.37s]  go. You know what to do. Here it comes. Come and get me. It's just free money. It's the same
[5671.37s -> 5685.14s]  minigame. Just a little different. I'm coming. I'm coming. Get ya. Yes. You got me. You found me.
[5685.78s -> 5695.93s]  Do we get to see their fun dance thing? All right. Here we go. It's the moment we've all been waiting
[5695.93s -> 5750.04s]  for. This is kind of weird. I'm like, all right, let me look. All right. Now do it again. No. We
[5750.04s -> 5757.48s]  can't. What's wrong with you? What's going on? Why are you on fire? Is this on fire? Are you on fire?
[5758.20s -> 5776.90s]  What's going on? It's on fire? How do I... Why are you on fire? He's gonna die. He's not gonna die. All
[5776.90s -> 5793.61s]  right. Give me a seed. What is this? Is this a seed? This is more cube than seed. Where should it go?
[5794.33s -> 5816.87s]  Over here? How's everything else look? How the thistles look? Go eat those carrots.
[5817.51s -> 5821.50s]  That's what they're there for. We fell asleep eating. It's okay. When you wake up in the morning,
[5821.50s -> 5827.75s]  you eat them. Anything else need watering? Over here. Oh, shit. I think these are dying.
[5828.31s -> 5852.71s]  No, these are fine. What is in here? Stop. Stop. Stop. You're gonna kill it. Okay. A baby?
[5854.89s -> 5862.55s]  Oh, yeah. Look, a little baby. That's not your house. Get out of here. He thinks he's a sparrow.
[5862.55s -> 5880.49s]  Hi, sparrow. No, you're not. Get out of here. Eat a daisy or a buttercup. Okay.
[5888.30s -> 5900.18s]  Shovel upgrade. Nice. It actually is intact. This is progress, but it's very slow.
[5900.74s -> 5904.02s]  Let's see if a better shovel will make you a better gardener.
[5904.66s -> 5909.46s]  This is the seed shovel. You can dig seed holes with it by pressing A.
[5910.34s -> 5917.06s]  I'm sure you'll work out what seed holes are for. So this is to make them grow better, faster.
[5918.02s -> 5936.22s]  That makes sense. Okay. How's everybody doing? Another baby. The carrots are gonna rot.
[5937.10s -> 5948.58s]  I just sell them? How much is the reward for growing corn? Ten bucks to sell. Okay. Sell.

[12752.09s -> 12763.69s]  i'm gonna make everybody real sad though because people thought it was a baby game
[12769.18s -> 12787.62s]  glasses cat is cool too well if you're you're allergic get out of here i have to leave i thought
[12787.62s -> 12799.59s]  this was a game from moms have to get apples i have i have responsibilities they need to be
[12799.59s -> 12812.92s]  taken care of i have to do them tap the tree holy fuck that's a lot of apples how much does an apple
[12812.92s -> 12818.82s]  sell for that's pretty good all right next time i'm gonna have a bunch of apple trees
[12819.62s -> 12833.96s]  i'll leave a couple my shop is what moms would play before getting picking up the kids from school
[12834.92s -> 12843.32s]  move to the second game yeah what we'll do is what's the what is the second game this is like
[12843.32s -> 12852.70s]  two more right those shoes i feel like they're a hindrance trouble in paradise is the second
[12852.70s -> 12862.70s]  game so why do they not call like view of pinata 2 party animals is the one that i played all right
[12862.70s -> 12867.90s]  i feel like i'm just starting to unlock the reason why this game is fun so here's what's

[12877.22s -> 12892.78s]  off stream for an hour or two to get just through the tutorial no no don't no why i refuse what
[12892.78s -> 12897.75s]  did just to get it started because we've already kind of seen the beginning that's unacceptable
[12897.75s -> 12902.60s]  let's say i think that's acceptable to just say you don't have to so you guys don't have to see
[12902.60s -> 12914.97s]  that this is how you clear a dirt with a shovel all right oh well we want to watch all right we

[13309.72s -> 13315.29s]  basically true i did play it i played the cues of zero and i got i got i just didn't give enough
[13315.29s -> 13338.82s]  time i got bored that was awesome that wouldn't even hurt though that's the best part about this
[13340.36s -> 13353.74s]  that's the softest fluffiest head in the world and it makes this thud on wood sound holy shit
[13354.30s -> 13387.06s]  is he darth raidering this guy well now i need to watch the whole movie so that was a good little
[13387.06s -> 13404.63s]  taste turned into a metronome yeah what the hell was that i think you'd like yakuza zero i got
[13404.63s -> 13410.63s]  through the first four or five hours of yakuza zero and i just stopped why did i stop i streamed
[13410.63s -> 13426.57s]  it what was the point of me stopping why did i stop i gave a reason right people were getting
[13426.57s -> 13439.83s]  bored i got annoyed with it because there was a hundred hours left there's a lot of dialogue
[13439.83s -> 13444.39s]  you had to read you hate good games i just played chibi rubble yesterday i said it was one of my

[13591.91s -> 13606.34s]  anymore speaking of not making things anymore what does rare even do now there's like a whole
[13606.34s -> 13627.19s]  rare office at microsoft they made sea of thieves yeah i heard sea of thieves is actually kind of
[13627.19s -> 13633.99s]  fun i'm not gonna say oh my god everyone rare used to make good games rare i mean i've heard
[13633.99s -> 13648.28s]  sea thieves is actually kind of fun i don't know how fun it's fun with friends but anyways uh yeah
[13648.28s -> 13657.42s]  you can get it for five to six bucks thanks hailey for the stupid they're doing battle toads oh
[13657.42s -> 13663.77s]  that's really cool i hope it's good when they redid uh the teenage mutant ninja turtles beat
[13663.77s -> 13673.90s]  them up it was absolutely fucking atrocious so old beat them ups they they try to translate them into
[13673.90s -> 13679.61s]  3d and they try to translate them into the kind of 2020 i haven't played one that i thought was
[13679.61s -> 13684.25s]  any good that was supposed to be some kind of reimagining a remake of an old classic
[13685.05s -> 13696.42s]  sure there have been some beat them ups that have come out that are 2d they made the original
[13696.42s -> 13707.80s]  battle toads so it should be good i hope so looks cool making a breath of the wild clone
[13707.80s -> 13716.26s]  really look into that hey lucas or lucius thanks for the 500 bits hey german just want to show
[13716.26s -> 13720.34s]  some appreciation i know this was a while back but i really loved your outer world stream so
[13720.34s -> 13725.56s]  i'm thinking of playing it myself i don't usually play scary games but i think having what you play
[13725.56s -> 13733.24s]  at first is going to help anyway have a good night that game is only as scary as you make it
[13733.72s -> 13742.58s]  it's more exploration than it is scary like if you fly a thousand miles per hour into a planet
[13742.58s -> 13750.25s]  you'll scream that's scary i did it a lot is that it was actually terrifying but the game itself is
[13752.98s -> 13759.98s]  the anglerfish are kind of terrifying and i guess you can't just avoid that place
[13760.62s -> 13764.57s]  you know what i mean like it's not just like oh i just won't do that part well you have to
[13764.57s -> 13768.89s]  you know what i mean you have to like do you have to go to like that all the planets like you can
[13768.97s -> 13778.68s]  skip it but yeah hope you have fun with it it was a great game it was very very very fun
[13783.05s -> 13794.20s]  a grave embrace thanks to the 360 three dollars and 60 cents uh they linked up an image it says
[13794.20s -> 13799.48s]  for safety reasons we recommend you to use a special password that you don't use anywhere
[13799.48s -> 13811.48s]  in the internet reliability level tall password must consistent what is this i don't i don't know
[13811.48s -> 13825.72s]  what this is i don't get it because i because i'm short or something pre-stream joke oh
[13826.68s -> 13840.26s]  phylactery thanks for the hundred bucks actually more than that 150 bucks because of the last
[13840.26s -> 13850.50s]  message thanks a lot dude you continue to give stupid amounts of money to the stream it's a lot
[13850.50s -> 13865.98s]  of fucking money and you give it all the time so thank you again thanks a lot the stalker guy is
[13865.98s -> 13870.46s]  going to give you a million dollars no i made it really clear i don't i don't i don't take bribes
[13871.18s -> 13883.22s]  but thanks a lot sam freelance police thanks for the 500 bits hey germa i turned 20 on monday
[13883.94s -> 13892.97s]  happy 20th birthday hope you had a good one what did you eat what did you eat on your birthday
[13893.53s -> 13908.46s]  corned beef hash what was it is it corned beef hash corned beef hash all right nice
[13909.26s -> 13916.58s]  this one i always have to make sure people are eating that i'm having a mild crisis though i'm
[13916.58s -> 13921.22s]  studying game design in university but i also recently got into music production i had a lot
[13921.22s -> 13926.74s]  more fun working on a song i sent you than any game design project and i've been spending my
[13926.74s -> 13931.54s]  semester break learning and doing more music stuff i feel like i'm going to pursue this
[13931.54s -> 13936.98s]  professionally i don't know what to focus on now for a future career if i should switch courses
[13936.98s -> 13945.05s]  or stay have you got any advice the best advice that i could possibly give for something like this
[13948.36s -> 13958.18s]  is i would try to do them both now i don't know how far into game design you are
[13958.74s -> 13968.07s]  because you say i'm studying game design at university how far into game design university
[13968.07s -> 13976.90s]  are you just do both well what i mean by that is you can make music in your free time but also
[13976.90s -> 13987.83s]  study to do something like game design and like i said before i don't know how many years or so
[13987.83s -> 14000.86s]  you've been pursuing a game design degree that's literally what i'm going to do yeah you're making
[14000.86s -> 14008.57s]  progress learning music on your own keep studying game design work on music as a passion yeah now
[14008.57s -> 14014.09s]  one of the arguments against that would be well i can't dedicate my time to both the same time
[14014.09s -> 14018.89s]  and put the passion i want to put into my music projects because of all the stuff i have to put
[14018.89s -> 14026.76s]  into my game design schoolwork and projects but that's how you try to make a balance just
[14026.76s -> 14038.02s]  for your life in general and it is hard to do that it is hard to work and do a passion at the
[14038.02s -> 14045.83s]  same time it is hard to have two passions that you equally care about and give them both the
[14045.83s -> 14055.27s]  same amount of attention it's hard to do that but i would say for as long as you can and depending
[14055.27s -> 14059.75s]  on like i said how long you've been in school for i would try to keep up getting your degree in game
[14059.75s -> 14076.38s]  design while doing music on the side but also i am not you if i really really cared about music
[14076.38s -> 14081.66s]  production and that's i that i know it now i this is all i fucking care about it's all i want to do
[14083.30s -> 14086.10s]  there's also that scenario where you'll finish your game design degree
[14088.06s -> 14094.06s]  and you'll be like well i don't even want to do this now it actually that that's not
[14095.93s -> 14101.50s]  unfortunately that's not necessarily an uncommon thing that happens in college
[14101.50s -> 14105.18s]  a lot of people will go to school for something and then just decide that it's not something they
[14105.18s -> 14119.91s]  wanted to do so it can be tricky and i unfortunately i don't have the right answer for you i think you
[14119.91s -> 14139.61s]  already might know the answer i think you might already know the answer i don't feels good man
[14140.89s -> 14151.11s]  but i wish you luck whatever you do whether you pursue music or you pursue game design or you try
[14151.11s -> 14160.07s]  to do them both i wish you luck some people switch their major several times it's more
[14160.07s -> 14172.55s]  common to switch than your major than not right that's true feels amazing man i don't know
[14173.35s -> 14185.66s]  but i wish you luck thanks for the five bucks gave the idiot thanks for the five dollars as well
[14186.22s -> 14189.58s]  there must want to let you know i forgive you for how you treated me in the mcdonald's
[14189.58s -> 14194.14s]  drive-through last weekend the coke you threw at me stained my shirt but i understand
[14194.14s -> 14206.82s]  you were just drumpy grumpy because your uh mcnuggets were late love you stripes beast
[14206.82s -> 14211.30s]  thanks with five dollars stripes beast germa i decoded your message on tuesday and i can't

[14234.04s -> 14243.00s]  be fun hey zip flow thanks for the 500 bits thanks for all the streams lad you've helped me get

[14378.14s -> 14381.82s]  lemmy says hey germa been a while since i've been able to watch one of your streams
[14381.82s -> 14385.82s]  and i can't help but notice there's still no germa psycho emote would you like to explain yourself
[14389.98s -> 14398.95s]  yeah i know i know i have to sit on i just i've enabled more bt tv emotes than my own emotes
[14398.95s -> 14406.38s]  that you pay for in the last 30 days i'm gonna i'm gonna dump a ton of new emotes on you guys
[14406.38s -> 14411.69s]  randomly you're gonna get a shitload of them and i'm not even gonna tell it's just gonna happen
[14412.41s -> 14433.38s]  don't worry i will i will i will i will i will a 50 part bugleberry emote uh spiritual hog thanks
[14433.38s -> 14439.56s]  for the 400 bits check out amazing island for the game cube might be a good stream game i think i
[14439.56s -> 14450.30s]  was looking at that i didn't buy it though i was looking at it i think amazing island yeah i was
[14450.30s -> 14463.61s]  looking at this maybe i'll get it and finally blueberry juice with 250 thanks to the 250 they
[14463.61s -> 14469.05s]  say hey germa chan i also very much agree on you streaming the yakuza games again although i would
[14469.05s -> 14475.88s]  recommend one of the games with less mini game grinding like the businesses in yakuza zero okay
[14475.96s -> 14480.92s]  some other good starters are yakuza four or three those two are way more straight to the point
[14481.72s -> 14487.32s]  plus they're really easy they're really easy to get invested into yakuza zero is the meme one so
[14487.32s -> 14510.68s]  that's a bummer here's a clip of some of the chaos you might see all right all right all right okay
[14510.68s -> 14518.70s]  all right i might just play it all right i know they're fucking funny and they're crazy i know i
[14518.70s -> 14526.47s]  know i know i know i know i really should play them just for some i got i probably shouldn't
