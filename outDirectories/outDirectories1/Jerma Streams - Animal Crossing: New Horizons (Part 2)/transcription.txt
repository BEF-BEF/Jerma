[9.53s -> 22.89s]  Welcome back to Animal Crossing. This would be day 2 of Animal Crossing.
[22.89s -> 24.89s]  What do you mean it was real? I told you we were doing this yesterday.
[24.89s -> 28.28s]  Garbage game.
[28.28s -> 30.28s]  In the middle of like a bunch of pogs.
[30.28s -> 32.28s]  Garbage game.
[32.28s -> 34.28s]  God damn it. It's alright. Don't worry.
[34.28s -> 39.78s]  Let me just change one or two small things.
[39.78s -> 46.95s]  Have...eh...
[46.95s -> 48.95s]  That's good. It's gonna probably flash for a second.
[48.95s -> 53.02s]  Looks alright. I do have to change this.
[53.02s -> 59.54s]  There we go. So this is day 2.
[59.54s -> 64.51s]  Let me change the title.
[64.51s -> 66.51s]  Micro games 500% hurry.
[66.51s -> 68.51s]  This makes sense.
[68.51s -> 73.76s]  I mean this is like micro gaming, isn't it?
[73.76s -> 75.76s]  Animal Crossing. New Horizons.
[75.76s -> 80.50s]  Is this on the GameCube? No, it is not.
[80.50s -> 87.07s]  Not.
[87.07s -> 89.07s]  So the question is, am I gonna keep a facecam on for this?
[89.07s -> 94.62s]  Fuck. I mean I turned it on already.
[94.62s -> 99.66s]  Fuck. I'm gonna have to.
[99.66s -> 107.01s]  Fuck. Alright, let's go.
[107.01s -> 109.01s]  Are you gonna get negative viewers? That's alright.
[109.01s -> 114.56s]  Whatever.
[114.56s -> 123.95s]  We're just playing Animal Crossing, man.
[123.95s -> 126.38s]  What's going on here? Is it Donald Duck?
[126.38s -> 128.56s]  Why is Donald Duck in the game?
[128.56s -> 141.79s]  Why is Donald Duck in this game?
[141.79s -> 143.79s]  Testing, testing, test, test, test.
[143.79s -> 145.79s]  Hello, every...
[145.79s -> 147.79s]  Oh dear, so sorry about that.
[147.79s -> 150.22s]  The volume's a little loud there.
[150.22s -> 154.38s]  Fix the screen?
[154.38s -> 161.23s]  What's wrong with the screen?
[161.23s -> 164.69s]  What do you mean the screen?
[164.69s -> 168.59s]  Make it bigger.
[168.59s -> 170.59s]  What are you guys doing? Oh dear, so sorry about that.
[170.59s -> 173.34s]  The volume's a little loud.
[173.34s -> 175.34s]  Hello. Starting today, I'll be doing an island-wide
[175.34s -> 177.34s]  broadcast full of island updates going on and such.
[181.40s -> 183.40s]  I'll go over some things that are very important to island life,
[183.40s -> 185.40s]  so lend me your island ears for a short time.
[185.40s -> 188.92s]  It's the only thing that we kick off this daily ritual
[188.92s -> 190.92s]  with a doozy of an island announcement.
[190.92s -> 192.92s]  The Saltcrest Airport is now
[192.92s -> 197.72s]  open for business.
[197.72s -> 199.72s]  Starting today, you can use online or local communication
[199.72s -> 201.72s]  to fly to other islands for a visit.
[201.72s -> 203.72s]  That's not all. No, no, no. The airport counter now offers
[203.72s -> 205.72s]  a postal service as well.
[205.72s -> 209.88s]  And just like the Resident Service Center,
[209.88s -> 211.88s]  the airport is open 24 hours a day, so please drop by
[211.88s -> 214.31s]  for a look.
[214.31s -> 216.31s]  I do have one other item to share, and it too is a whopper.
[217.31s -> 219.31s]  As this very day, a brilliant fellow by the name of Blathers
[219.31s -> 221.31s]  will be joining us at Saltcrest.
[221.31s -> 223.49s]  That's the, uh, that's the...
[223.49s -> 227.01s]  Let Us In.
[227.01s -> 229.01s]  I'm not fucking giving you guys my Nintendo Switch address.
[229.01s -> 231.01s]  That's a mistake.
[231.01s -> 233.89s]  As this very day, Blathers will be joining us
[233.89s -> 235.89s]  at Saltcrest.
[235.89s -> 237.89s]  He has a keen interest in biology,
[237.89s -> 239.89s]  past and present, and he's here to study Saltcrest.
[239.89s -> 242.19s]  Still, I hope everyone lends their cooperation.
[242.19s -> 244.19s]  Yes, this is the museum guy.
[244.19s -> 246.19s]  Alright, let's go pick up weeds and shit.
[246.19s -> 249.78s]  Let Us In.
[249.78s -> 251.78s]  I'm not, no, I'm not letting you guys in.
[251.78s -> 256.06s]  There are streamer codes.
[256.06s -> 259.97s]  I just want to pick up fucking weeds and stuff
[259.97s -> 261.97s]  and hit rocks with shovels for like an hour.
[263.97s -> 265.97s]  Oh, that's gotta change.
[265.97s -> 267.97s]  I forgot about this guy.
[267.97s -> 269.97s]  Uh, that looks bad. I don't want to look like this.
[269.97s -> 273.30s]  Whoa!
[273.30s -> 275.30s]  Look at all this mail.
[275.30s -> 277.30s]  Happy Home Academy.
[277.30s -> 279.30s]  Greetings from the Happy Home Academy, our goal
[279.30s -> 281.73s]  is to make your home the best.
[281.73s -> 287.04s]  Alright, gimme it.
[287.04s -> 289.04s]  The Nook Mileage Program
[289.04s -> 291.04s]  wishes to express our gratitude for your continued use
[291.04s -> 293.04s]  of the Nook Stomp and Nook Mileage Program.
[293.04s -> 295.04s]  The item you claim via our redemption is attached
[295.04s -> 297.34s]  to this message.
[297.34s -> 299.90s]  Oh, right, didn't I buy a bunch of shit yesterday?
[299.90s -> 304.06s]  Hold on.
[304.06s -> 309.82s]  We got a lot of crap in here.
[309.82s -> 314.82s]  Wooden mini table.
[314.82s -> 316.82s]  Sweet, I learned it. Oh, DIY wooden table.
[316.82s -> 318.82s]  Wait, I got a house now!
[318.82s -> 320.82s]  This isn't a tent anymore, this is a house.
[320.82s -> 328.82s]  Hold on.
[328.82s -> 330.82s]  Important.
[330.82s -> 333.70s]  What are the tips?
[333.70s -> 335.70s]  Turn lights on in our decorating mode and open storage.
[335.70s -> 338.26s]  That's good to know.
[338.26s -> 340.94s]  Make the room brighter or dimmer.
[340.94s -> 343.12s]  This feature lets you easily make design changes.
[343.12s -> 345.12s]  And open storage.
[345.12s -> 347.12s]  When in your home, you can open your pocket,
[347.12s -> 349.12s]  select furniture or other items. Yeah.
[349.12s -> 352.88s]  I like that better.
[352.88s -> 354.88s]  Okay, what about decorating?
[354.88s -> 357.50s]  Oh, I don't have anything.
[357.50s -> 363.18s]  I don't have shit.
[363.18s -> 368.82s]  Okay, well, let's pick this up. Put this in the corner.
[368.82s -> 372.40s]  I'm so glad you don't have to push this
[372.40s -> 378.86s]  and pull this and all that crap.
[378.86s -> 382.82s]  Switch. Right here.
[382.82s -> 385.63s]  And then the radio. Put this over here.
[385.63s -> 387.63s]  This house is pretty bad.
[387.63s -> 390.32s]  Radio in the middle so we can both listen to our favorite tunes.
[390.32s -> 392.32s]  And then the switch so we can both watch TV in bed.
[392.32s -> 398.00s]  Looks good.
[398.00s -> 403.44s]  No, that's the same thing.
[403.44s -> 407.34s]  Do I have anything else? No.
[407.34s -> 409.34s]  Alright, let's go get the elephant slides that I had.
[409.34s -> 414.83s]  Let's go put them in here.
[414.83s -> 416.83s]  I've got lots of mail and all this stuff.
[416.83s -> 421.12s]  Alright, hold on. What's this one?
[421.12s -> 425.28s]  Oh, eyes!
[425.28s -> 427.28s]  It's fucking 3D glasses.
[427.28s -> 429.28s]  Alright, where should I put my slides?
[429.28s -> 434.85s]  Change clothes.
[434.85s -> 437.73s]  My dear Jeremy,
[437.73s -> 439.73s]  how is your new life treating you?
[439.73s -> 441.73s]  Are you eating well, brushing your teeth, washing behind your ears?
[441.73s -> 443.73s]  Oh dear, I'm all worked up.
[443.73s -> 445.73s]  Here's a little something to help out.
[445.73s -> 447.73s]  Eat it or plant it, but think of me, says mom.
[447.73s -> 450.16s]  This is nice. This is sweet.
[450.16s -> 454.70s]  Alright, elephant slide. Get it.
[454.70s -> 458.86s]  I gotta go sell a bunch of crap.
[458.86s -> 462.38s]  Alright, hold on. Elephant slide.
[462.38s -> 466.40s]  Hell yeah.
[466.40s -> 468.83s]  It's just so good.
[468.83s -> 471.33s]  Alright, what did mom give me?
[471.33s -> 473.33s]  Apples. Ooh, thanks mom.
[473.33s -> 483.62s]  Should I turn it this way?
[483.62s -> 491.28s]  Spin it. There we go.
[491.28s -> 493.58s]  Can I get on it? If I can't slide this,
[493.58s -> 495.58s]  this is not worth 4,000 fucking bells.
[495.58s -> 500.96s]  I can't slide on the slide.
[500.96s -> 508.82s]  You've gotta be shitting me.
[508.82s -> 518.67s]  Put away the net?
[518.67s -> 520.67s]  How do you just put it away completely?
[520.67s -> 524.13s]  Tap A, don't hold.
[524.13s -> 529.63s]  How do you put something down? Down on D-pad?
[529.63s -> 534.82s]  Okay. I can't get on the slide.
[534.82s -> 543.12s]  Bring it.
[543.12s -> 545.12s]  Alright, shopping. I got the loafers.
[545.12s -> 552.85s]  Can I store this? No.
[552.85s -> 554.85s]  ZL to check your nook miles.
[554.85s -> 559.26s]  Are those the same?
[559.26s -> 562.27s]  Slip on loafers?
[562.27s -> 564.27s]  What's the difference?
[564.27s -> 566.94s]  It's green. It's not a big difference.
[566.94s -> 568.94s]  Alright, I gotta get rid of some stuff.
[568.94s -> 572.45s]  I can't even open my mail.
[572.45s -> 574.45s]  I gotta go talk to the museum guy.
[574.45s -> 581.47s]  Dream house.
[581.47s -> 586.14s]  How many miles is it? 500, that's pretty good.
[586.14s -> 588.70s]  Put it in the house storage.
[588.70s -> 598.43s]  This is relaxing now.
[598.43s -> 602.14s]  I'm like, this is good.
[602.14s -> 604.14s]  This is where I want to be.
[604.14s -> 606.45s]  Okay, how do I put this in here?
[606.45s -> 610.86s]  Put it in storage.
[610.86s -> 612.86s]  Am I gonna hang it on the wall?
[612.86s -> 616.45s]  I can hang the sneakers on the wall.
[616.45s -> 618.82s]  Why would I do that?
[618.82s -> 622.46s]  Alright, let's put...
[622.46s -> 624.90s]  I'll keep everything else.
[624.90s -> 631.62s]  In Back to the Future 3,
[631.62s -> 633.62s]  what profession did Doc Brown have?
[633.62s -> 637.71s]  He was a scientist.
[637.71s -> 645.01s]  Oh, they're blooming, that's cool.
[645.01s -> 647.01s]  Good. All the mail has been looked at.
[647.01s -> 649.76s]  Right?
[649.76s -> 651.76s]  Wait, where's my...
[651.76s -> 654.77s]  Alright, I got everything.
[654.77s -> 662.50s]  Alright, water this shit.
[662.50s -> 664.50s]  These are gonna be beautiful the next time we play.
[664.50s -> 668.08s]  Oh, shit.
[668.08s -> 670.70s]  I just realized something.
[670.70s -> 672.70s]  So, those of you that weren't here at the beginning of the stream,
[672.70s -> 674.70s]  I am not gonna be here
[674.70s -> 676.94s]  for at least a few days.
[676.94s -> 678.94s]  I will be gone for probably four or five
[678.94s -> 680.94s]  days.
[680.94s -> 682.94s]  I don't like to say that.
[682.94s -> 684.94s]  But,
[684.94s -> 686.94s]  I have a lot of shit to do
[686.94s -> 689.38s]  in my personal life.
[689.38s -> 691.38s]  So, a lot of things going on
[691.38s -> 693.38s]  that has to be taken care of.
[693.38s -> 706.94s]  What am I gonna do about Animal Crossing?
[706.94s -> 708.94s]  Play offline and then update us.
[708.94s -> 712.34s]  Alright, what if I don't?
[712.34s -> 715.54s]  What if I just like, don't do that?
[715.54s -> 717.54s]  Just play it off stream and update you guys?
[717.54s -> 719.54s]  Is that okay?
[719.54s -> 721.54s]  Alright, that sounds fun.
[721.54s -> 723.54s]  I'm not gonna play that much, only like an hour or so a day.
[723.54s -> 725.54s]  I might not even play it.
[725.54s -> 729.82s]  I'm gonna be so fucking busy.
[729.82s -> 731.82s]  Those of you that are curious,
[731.82s -> 733.82s]  I'm moving.
[733.82s -> 736.06s]  Staying in Vegas.
[736.06s -> 738.06s]  But I didn't want to make a big deal about it because obviously
[738.06s -> 740.06s]  many people hear that word.
[740.06s -> 742.06s]  And it's really, really bad timing too
[742.06s -> 744.06s]  because just everything is getting set here.
[744.06s -> 746.06s]  But,
[746.06s -> 748.06s]  staying in Vegas, just going to a different spot.
[748.06s -> 750.24s]  And,
[750.24s -> 752.24s]  I didn't want to really talk that much about it because obviously
[752.24s -> 754.24s]  when people hear the word moving, they go,
[754.24s -> 756.24s]  wait a minute, what, he's moving? He's fucking moving?
[756.24s -> 758.24s]  What's wrong? And so I don't want to, you know, make a big deal about it.
[758.24s -> 760.24s]  Staying in Vegas.
[760.24s -> 763.25s]  Somebody want to link the,
[763.25s -> 765.25s]  there's a link, there's a hashtag
[765.25s -> 767.25s]  exclamation point
[767.25s -> 769.25s]  thing that explains why
[769.25s -> 771.25s]  you read it,
[771.25s -> 773.25s]  read it,
[773.25s -> 775.25s]  it's right there, it's a few sentences.
[775.25s -> 777.55s]  Somebody's got it, right?
[777.55s -> 781.46s]  No, no, no, no, nothing,
[781.46s -> 783.46s]  the exclamation point, there you go, somebody's got it, there you go.
[783.46s -> 786.14s]  Why isn't that one working?
[786.14s -> 788.14s]  So you see, since the number of hormones is increasing, I agree that we need
[788.14s -> 790.14s]  Oh, there's like a person face down with me.
[790.14s -> 792.70s]  Hold on.
[792.70s -> 794.70s]  I should probably do that.
[794.70s -> 799.06s]  I have every confidence that
[799.06s -> 801.06s]  you'll find a way to handle this little puzzle.
[801.06s -> 803.06s]  Holy shit, he's fucking
[803.06s -> 805.06s]  moving? See, this is what I'm talking about.
[805.06s -> 808.62s]  This is what I was talking about.
[808.62s -> 810.62s]  Uh, the two of you have been training under me for how many
[810.62s -> 813.57s]  years now? Hmm.
[813.57s -> 817.02s]  This should be a piece of cake.
[817.02s -> 819.39s]  No more of rumor.
[819.39s -> 821.39s]  I don't, I don't know.
[821.39s -> 823.39s]  I don't think that's possible in Las Vegas to not
[823.39s -> 826.40s]  have a rumor. I don't think that's possible.
[826.40s -> 829.34s]  Are you happy with your home?
[829.34s -> 831.34s]  Is it meeting your expectations that you'll
[831.34s -> 833.34s]  be a lot more comfortable now?
[833.34s -> 835.34s]  Houses are so different from tents.
[835.34s -> 837.34s]  You can freely change up the flooring and wallpaper.
[837.34s -> 839.34s]  You've got some
[839.34s -> 841.34s]  built-in storage so you can put away the furniture you aren't
[841.34s -> 843.34s]  using.
[843.34s -> 845.78s]  There's more! There's more.
[845.78s -> 847.78s]  All homeowners are automatically
[847.78s -> 849.78s]  registered with the Happy Home Academy.
[849.78s -> 851.78s]  Uh, and evaluate your
[851.78s -> 853.78s]  home on a regular basis to send you helpful advice.
[853.78s -> 855.78s]  Are you going to evaluate my house?
[857.78s -> 859.78s]  No more streams for another season?
[859.78s -> 861.95s]  No, no.
[861.95s -> 863.95s]  The move from Vegas to
[863.95s -> 865.95s]  Vegas is not the same as
[865.95s -> 867.95s]  the move from Boston to Vegas.
[867.95s -> 870.13s]  One of them is across the country.
[870.13s -> 872.94s]  The other one's in the same city.
[872.94s -> 875.18s]  So, I will be back
[875.18s -> 877.49s]  within
[877.49s -> 879.49s]  four or five days. It won't, it's not going to
[879.49s -> 884.67s]  take that long. Trust me.
[884.67s -> 886.67s]  Yeah, the mileage on a hot air balloon,
[886.67s -> 888.67s]  I'll get there in like four, six,
[888.67s -> 890.67s]  seven days, something like that.
[890.67s -> 893.55s]  Four to five years.
[893.55s -> 895.55s]  Not four to five decades!
[895.55s -> 897.55s]  Am I even going to be alive in five
[897.55s -> 901.82s]  decades? How old am I?
[901.82s -> 903.82s]  I'll be like 85!
[903.82s -> 905.82s]  Am I going to be alive when I'm like 90?
[905.82s -> 907.82s]  I don't even, that's like a long
[907.82s -> 916.66s]  fucking time. Why do I like
[916.66s -> 919.41s]  Vegas? Well, we,
[919.41s -> 921.41s]  I mean, you're talking about a conversation
[921.41s -> 923.41s]  we had dozens and dozens
[923.41s -> 925.41s]  of times almost two years ago.
[925.41s -> 927.58s]  I'm here. I love it here.
[927.58s -> 929.82s]  I love this city.
[929.82s -> 932.51s]  I want to stay in this city. Pretty much it.
[932.51s -> 935.14s]  Oh, that
[935.14s -> 937.14s]  98,000 bells.
[937.14s -> 939.14s]  Can I pay in miles?
[939.14s -> 942.27s]  Can you pay in miles?
[942.27s -> 946.03s]  Oh, no.
[946.03s -> 948.34s]  What's going to have to do with Tallix?
[948.34s -> 950.34s]  I think Tallix is staying here. I think
[950.34s -> 952.77s]  Tallix is staying in Vegas too. That's the
[952.77s -> 955.58s]  plan. So,
[955.58s -> 957.95s]  look, the last couple
[957.95s -> 959.95s]  years has been
[959.95s -> 961.95s]  sort of a trial period if
[961.95s -> 964.26s]  it was something that we wanted to even do.
[964.26s -> 967.14s]  You know, I remember this,
[967.14s -> 969.14s]  I've never done anything like this before.
[969.14s -> 971.14s]  I lived in Massachusetts my entire life.
[971.14s -> 973.38s]  So, coming out across
[973.38s -> 975.38s]  the whole country was like, you know, obviously
[975.38s -> 977.38s]  I wanted to spend a year or two years
[977.38s -> 979.38s]  or so to find out
[979.38s -> 981.74s]  is this something I actually want to do? Do I
[981.74s -> 983.74s]  actually want to be here more than a year or two?
[983.74s -> 985.74s]  That was for everybody involved.
[985.74s -> 987.98s]  And the answer is yes.
[987.98s -> 990.72s]  And wherever,
[990.72s -> 992.72s]  you know, wherever
[992.72s -> 994.72s]  Tallix ends up wanting to be, that's where he wants to be.
[994.72s -> 997.47s]  I'm pretty sure he's
[997.47s -> 999.90s]  staying in Vegas. That's at least the plan.
[999.90s -> 1003.74s]  But that's kind of what,
[1003.74s -> 1006.24s]  that's the way it is, right?
[1006.24s -> 1008.24s]  I forgot about the nightbot command. Oh, no.
[1008.24s -> 1012.53s]  Enter the gamer hubs.
[1012.53s -> 1014.53s]  No, he's not staying with me. No, not anymore.
[1014.53s -> 1017.65s]  Not after this week.
[1017.65s -> 1019.65s]  Is Kim? Yes, Kim is coming with me.
[1019.65s -> 1021.65s]  Him and I will be moving and so will
[1021.65s -> 1025.30s]  Tallix as well. But I can't,
[1025.30s -> 1027.54s]  this is, I obviously
[1027.54s -> 1029.54s]  don't want to make a big deal about moving
[1029.54s -> 1031.54s]  because I'm not going very far.
[1031.54s -> 1033.90s]  I'm staying in the city of Las Vegas.
[1033.90s -> 1035.90s]  So you, honestly, I'll be honest with you,
[1035.90s -> 1038.08s]  you probably won't even really see a
[1038.08s -> 1040.08s]  difference for stream downtime
[1040.08s -> 1043.71s]  because
[1043.71s -> 1046.21s]  the plan is by this
[1046.21s -> 1049.54s]  weekend to be done. We'll see.
[1049.54s -> 1053.82s]  What about Otto? Do you honestly
[1053.82s -> 1055.82s]  think that my dog is not coming with me?
[1055.82s -> 1058.45s]  What, how, what
[1058.45s -> 1063.06s]  are you talking about? Yeah,
[1063.06s -> 1065.06s]  we're gonna keep it going. Otto, you know, Otto's
[1065.06s -> 1067.06s]  gonna go get his own place, I think.
[1067.06s -> 1069.06s]  Otto's thinking about going and checking out some places.
[1069.06s -> 1072.26s]  He was apartment hunting the other day.
[1072.26s -> 1074.26s]  No, he's, he's my dog.
[1074.26s -> 1078.21s]  Anyways, uh,
[1078.21s -> 1080.21s]  again, don't want to make a big deal about it because it's not a big deal at all.
[1080.21s -> 1082.51s]  Not a big deal.
[1082.51s -> 1087.57s]  Not a big deal. Are you and Otto still
[1087.57s -> 1091.79s]  friends? Payments can be made using
[1091.79s -> 1093.79s]  the ABD feature of the Nook Stop.
[1093.79s -> 1095.79s]  I think that's everything I need to tell you about homes
[1095.79s -> 1099.18s]  today.
[1099.18s -> 1102.58s]  Otto is coming with me. I've said it like
[1102.58s -> 1105.84s]  five times. I have a nice surprise
[1105.84s -> 1108.02s]  for you. You ready for this?
[1108.02s -> 1110.02s]  It's a premium miles redemption,
[1110.02s -> 1112.51s]  a Nook Miles ticket.
[1112.51s -> 1114.51s]  Pretty sick. What is a Nook Miles
[1114.51s -> 1119.76s]  ticket?
[1119.76s -> 1121.76s]  It's a conundrum. We want to improve our island
[1121.76s -> 1123.76s]  but still hold on to that deserted island magic.
[1123.76s -> 1126.38s]  Well, now you can do both.
[1126.38s -> 1128.38s]  You can use one of these tickets
[1128.38s -> 1130.38s]  to do some island hopping adventuring. But yes, just
[1130.38s -> 1132.38s]  go anytime you want. If you're looking to meet
[1132.38s -> 1134.38s]  some new characters and gather materials for DIY projects,
[1134.38s -> 1136.38s]  excellent. Answer what question?
[1136.38s -> 1138.38s]  Answer the question. What, what question?
[1138.38s -> 1140.69s]  What question do you have? What are you talking about?
[1140.69s -> 1142.69s]  I just did. What question do you have?
[1142.69s -> 1144.69s]  You got me, you got me for 10 seconds. What question?
[1144.69s -> 1150.96s]  What do you got? What about Cheeto?
[1150.96s -> 1153.26s]  Yes. Are you and Otto
[1153.26s -> 1158.00s]  friends? Yes. Do you eat
[1158.00s -> 1161.78s]  ass? I plead with it!
[1161.78s -> 1168.48s]  Anything else?
[1168.48s -> 1170.91s]  No, she's not. I'm not even going to say it out loud.
[1170.91s -> 1172.91s]  Are you still
[1172.91s -> 1175.79s]  friends with Otto? Yes. Is Otto
[1175.79s -> 1177.79s]  a dog? Yes. You got four more seconds.
[1177.79s -> 1180.35s]  What about Chad? You guys don't, you guys
[1180.35s -> 1182.35s]  don't live in my house.
[1182.35s -> 1184.35s]  No, you won't be coming with me in my house.
[1184.35s -> 1190.74s]  Any plans to...
[1190.74s -> 1192.74s]  We don't, you don't, you don't live in
[1192.74s -> 1194.74s]  my, no, you don't live in, you don't
[1194.74s -> 1198.64s]  live here. You don't,
[1198.64s -> 1200.64s]  none of you guys are here in this house.
[1200.64s -> 1203.46s]  So how can I bring you to the new,
[1203.46s -> 1205.46s]  a new place when you don't occupy
[1205.46s -> 1207.46s]  this house, this room here?
[1207.46s -> 1210.66s]  Alright, fine. I'm turning the fucking
[1210.66s -> 1212.66s]  digital vacuum on. No, this is weird.
[1212.66s -> 1214.66s]  This is weird. This is going to get weird. I don't want to do that.
[1214.66s -> 1217.15s]  Alright, you got me for two more seconds.
[1217.15s -> 1222.72s]  I'm not doing like a fucking, Jerma sucks
[1222.72s -> 1224.72s]  you up in a digital vacuum thing.
[1224.72s -> 1227.79s]  That's fucking weird. I don't like
[1227.79s -> 1229.79s]  that. You like the Olive Garden? Of course I do.
[1229.79s -> 1231.79s]  I especially love...
[1231.79s -> 1233.79s]  Out of all the things there, my favorite part
[1233.79s -> 1235.79s]  about going to the Olive Garden has to be...
[1243.79s -> 1245.79s]  Smoked mozzarella chicken.
[1247.79s -> 1250.35s]  I'm actually fucking just doing ads for
[1250.35s -> 1252.35s]  Olive Garden this whole stream.
[1252.35s -> 1255.04s]  I didn't even pay me any money or anything.
[1255.04s -> 1257.54s]  I'm doing this for no reason.
[1257.54s -> 1259.54s]  I am like shouting out the fuck
[1259.54s -> 1261.54s]  out of the Olive Garden for
[1261.54s -> 1263.54s]  almost two straight hours.
[1263.54s -> 1266.80s]  This is just for free.
[1266.80s -> 1277.47s]  Whatever.
[1277.47s -> 1279.47s]  That's for breadsticks. By the way,
[1279.47s -> 1281.65s]  they're endless. If you didn't know.
[1281.65s -> 1284.59s]  Alright, I could...
[1284.59s -> 1286.59s]  I could play a game.
[1286.59s -> 1288.59s]  Get the camera off.
[1288.59s -> 1290.59s]  I could play a game. I'm playing a video game
[1290.59s -> 1294.56s]  right now. I'll have to take it to the counter
[1294.56s -> 1296.56s]  to use it whenever you have travel strikes.
[1301.06s -> 1304.83s]  Wait, don't they have recycle?
[1304.83s -> 1309.42s]  Alright, let's go. Camera on.
[1309.42s -> 1311.42s]  No, no, it's late. It's getting late.
[1314.30s -> 1316.30s]  No, I don't... I do not want to
[1316.30s -> 1318.30s]  put the camera on. I think it's time
[1318.30s -> 1320.30s]  to just kind of hang out and chill.
[1320.30s -> 1322.48s]  Take a... I don't...
[1322.48s -> 1324.48s]  The camera doesn't have to be on anymore.
[1324.48s -> 1326.48s]  What's the point of the camera? What does the camera have to be on for
[1326.48s -> 1330.19s]  every day? Doesn't have to be.
[1330.19s -> 1333.52s]  What's the point? I can just not have the camera on
[1333.52s -> 1348.48s]  when I don't feel like it. Alright, here we go.
[1348.48s -> 1350.48s]  Let's play. What are some chores
[1350.48s -> 1352.48s]  I can do today? Oh, somebody's like
[1352.48s -> 1354.48s]  on the ground over there, right? Wait.
[1354.48s -> 1359.20s]  I gotta go down here. Oh, the fucking
[1359.20s -> 1362.02s]  game sound is muted.
[1362.02s -> 1364.02s]  I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
[1364.02s -> 1368.30s]  Alright, where's that person that was on the
[1368.30s -> 1375.92s]  beach? Get the bottle? I don't have
[1375.92s -> 1379.70s]  any room for the bottle. I don't have any room.
[1379.70s -> 1381.70s]  Oh, my pockets are full already.
[1381.70s -> 1384.00s]  I just put it down. I don't have any
[1384.00s -> 1387.78s]  room. I don't have any fucking room.
[1387.78s -> 1389.78s]  What is this? Elephant slide.
[1389.78s -> 1396.18s]  You know what? Just... What is this?
[1396.18s -> 1401.22s]  Ooh. There's someone out there
[1401.22s -> 1403.22s]  somewhere. The latest trend to
[1403.22s -> 1405.22s]  hit the waves is a little something I call self-care.
[1405.22s -> 1407.22s]  And how can you do that if you can't see yourself?
[1407.22s -> 1409.22s]  Take a little you time to make
[1409.22s -> 1411.22s]  this and any other recipe that floats
[1411.22s -> 1413.22s]  to shore. Cool.
[1413.22s -> 1415.39s]  Wooden full-length
[1415.39s -> 1422.43s]  mirror. That's cool.
[1422.43s -> 1425.38s]  Alright, okay.
[1425.38s -> 1430.50s]  Let's go talk to the
[1430.50s -> 1436.62s]  new guy. Donald Duck.
[1436.62s -> 1438.62s]  The waves. The waves are good. Already the
[1438.62s -> 1440.62s]  pool noodles.
[1440.62s -> 1446.51s]  I've asked storms to come and brace yourselves,
[1446.51s -> 1449.78s]  lads. Hard to starboard,
[1449.78s -> 1451.78s]  tough to port, stern to stern.
[1451.78s -> 1459.25s]  Oh, it's not Donald Duck.
[1459.25s -> 1461.25s]  It's Donald Pelican.
[1461.25s -> 1463.42s]  Blur. Do you have my
[1463.42s -> 1465.42s]  pickled herring pizza? I already tipped
[1465.42s -> 1467.42s]  online, so...
[1467.42s -> 1469.42s]  Wait, I don't see a pizza. Where am I? Where are you? Who am I?
[1469.42s -> 1471.92s]  Oh, hang on. I know that one.
[1471.92s -> 1473.92s]  I'm none other than Gulliver, a seafaring
[1473.92s -> 1476.80s]  seagull of the seven seas.
[1476.80s -> 1478.80s]  Were you the one who kept nudging me just now?
[1478.80s -> 1480.80s]  Thanks for the wake-up call.
[1480.80s -> 1482.80s]  Those hasty hallucinations tend to sneak
[1482.80s -> 1484.80s]  up on me. You find it
[1484.80s -> 1486.80s]  hard to forgive this waterlogged bird brain?
[1486.80s -> 1488.80s]  I'm reading your vacant expression
[1488.80s -> 1490.80s]  as a yes, you.
[1490.80s -> 1492.80s]  As I dozed off and tumbled overboard
[1492.80s -> 1494.80s]  again. That's an endearing
[1494.80s -> 1496.80s]  character trait of mine. My crewmates love
[1496.80s -> 1498.80s]  it when I slip over the bow. Ha!
[1498.80s -> 1500.80s]  Don't worry, the fellas
[1500.80s -> 1502.80s]  will be here to rescue me in no time. Got an ace
[1502.80s -> 1504.80s]  up my wing, you see.
[1504.80s -> 1506.80s]  I'll just call for help using my handy
[1506.80s -> 1509.17s]  dandy, uh...
[1509.17s -> 1511.17s]  Oh my. Oh my
[1511.17s -> 1513.17s]  gosh. My handy dandy communicator is
[1513.17s -> 1515.17s]  broken. This isn't handy OR dandy!
[1515.17s -> 1517.17s]  Oh, sardines. It's all cracked and busted.
[1517.17s -> 1519.17s]  Looks like it's missing a few communicator
[1519.17s -> 1521.47s]  parts. That means
[1521.47s -> 1523.47s]  I'll have to wait for my crew to find me
[1523.47s -> 1525.47s]  on their own.
[1525.47s -> 1527.47s]  That could take a while. I've only got enough
[1527.47s -> 1529.47s]  nautical puns to last a couple more hours.
[1529.47s -> 1531.47s]  I'm begging you, will you look for my
[1531.47s -> 1533.47s]  communicator parts, please?
[1533.47s -> 1538.27s]  Sure.
[1544.27s -> 1546.27s]  Communication parts are probably buried in the sand somewhere.
[1546.27s -> 1548.27s]  I'm just missing five parts.
[1548.27s -> 1550.27s]  Find them, I'll try to clear.
[1550.27s -> 1552.27s]  Get them back together again.
[1552.27s -> 1554.27s]  I'm sure my crewmates are looking for me, so
[1554.27s -> 1556.27s]  I better stay here and watch for the boat.
[1556.27s -> 1558.27s]  I'll leave the searching to you!
[1558.27s -> 1560.27s]  I believe in you, partner. I don't have much of a choice.
[1560.27s -> 1563.22s]  But let me get this straight.
[1563.22s -> 1565.22s]  Um, this character is
[1565.22s -> 1567.46s]  not in your game. But he's in mine.
[1567.46s -> 1570.51s]  Right?
[1570.51s -> 1580.30s]  Is this possible?
[1580.30s -> 1582.54s]  He shows up in everybody's.
[1582.54s -> 1584.54s]  This one everyone gets.
[1584.54s -> 1587.42s]  Oh, okay. There you are.
[1587.42s -> 1590.75s]  Okay, let's give him some creatures.
[1590.75s -> 1593.38s]  Ooh, a pleasure to meet you.
[1593.38s -> 1595.38s]  My name is Blathers.
[1595.38s -> 1597.38s]  I'm exceedingly interested in the ecosystem of this island.
[1597.38s -> 1599.38s]  Thus I have come to conduct research,
[1599.38s -> 1602.13s]  if you will. Could you be
[1602.13s -> 1604.13s]  that you are Jeremy, the personage
[1604.13s -> 1606.13s]  who chose the location for this tent?
[1606.13s -> 1608.13s]  I am.
[1608.13s -> 1610.37s]  Splendid job indeed, thanks to you, I was able to
[1610.37s -> 1612.37s]  uh, I thought they said
[1612.37s -> 1614.37s]  I'd. I was able to
[1614.37s -> 1616.37s]  I'd. I was able to get on here.
[1616.37s -> 1618.61s]  Now regarding the aforementioned research,
[1618.61s -> 1620.61s]  truth be told, I am determined
[1620.61s -> 1622.61s]  to open a museum and henceforth dwell on this
[1622.61s -> 1624.61s]  island amongst you.
[1624.61s -> 1626.78s]  If you discover any new types of inspector fish, come
[1626.78s -> 1628.78s]  bring it here. I will exhibit
[1628.78s -> 1630.78s]  them, as well as those you gave to Tom Nook.
[1630.78s -> 1633.34s]  Now there's one small problem.
[1633.34s -> 1635.65s]  I lack the number of exhibits needed to secure
[1635.65s -> 1637.65s]  permission to open a museum proper.
[1637.65s -> 1639.65s]  Empty display cases will not do, I'm told.
[1639.65s -> 1641.65s]  Display cases with something to display? That is another matter.
[1641.65s -> 1643.89s]  Where are you coming? Allow me
[1643.89s -> 1645.89s]  to explain.
[1645.89s -> 1647.89s]  I need insects. It's not just insects
[1647.89s -> 1649.89s]  and fish. I want fossils.
[1649.89s -> 1652.64s]  This is a substantial stretch of land
[1652.64s -> 1655.84s]  beyond the river. I would bet my pin
[1655.84s -> 1657.84s]  feathers. This primitive plot is flushed
[1657.84s -> 1661.30s]  with the fossils I require. On the river you say
[1661.30s -> 1663.30s]  I can't just go over it? Well, it's a boat.
[1663.30s -> 1666.67s]  Get on one. Pardon me, Jeremy,
[1666.67s -> 1668.67s]  while I transmit the vital data to your Nook phone.
[1668.67s -> 1675.95s]  I want to drink out of that.
[1675.95s -> 1677.95s]  Anybody else want to drink out of that thing?
[1677.95s -> 1679.95s]  There you see, with wood
[1679.95s -> 1681.95s]  gathered from salt, Chris one can
[1681.95s -> 1683.95s]  make a legendary pole vault.
[1683.95s -> 1685.95s]  This pole can be used to propel
[1685.95s -> 1687.95s]  oneself across the river. Up and over you go. Hooty
[1687.95s -> 1690.58s]  hoo. I sent DIY
[1690.58s -> 1692.75s]  schematics for a shovel. I dig
[1692.75s -> 1694.75s]  fossils from the ground as well, which brings me to my
[1694.75s -> 1696.75s]  point. Please,
[1696.75s -> 1698.75s]  Jeremy, cross the river and seek out these ancient
[1698.75s -> 1701.12s]  relics. My feathers have
[1701.12s -> 1703.81s]  lathered on for too long, but let me leave you with this.
[1703.81s -> 1705.81s]  Time to open the museum. I must acquire more items
[1705.81s -> 1708.43s]  to exhibit 15. I hope
[1708.43s -> 1715.14s]  you do it. What do I got? I have things
[1715.14s -> 1717.63s]  to donate.
[1717.63s -> 1720.19s]  Okay, so I have...
[1720.19s -> 1724.93s]  Take this moth. I got a bunch of shit outside
[1724.93s -> 1728.32s]  too. Repugnance.
[1728.32s -> 1730.32s]  What happens if I miss-maintain my composure?
[1730.32s -> 1732.32s]  I beg your pardon. Bugs I do detest
[1732.32s -> 1735.14s]  them. Wait, aren't you...don't you want them?
[1735.14s -> 1738.59s]  Still, there's much I can tell you about the
[1738.59s -> 1740.90s]  insect you apprehended. If you insist that is.
[1740.90s -> 1744.85s]  No. I know what a moth is.
[1744.85s -> 1746.85s]  That's the joke.
[1746.85s -> 1750.43s]  Bugs are the bane of my existence.
[1750.43s -> 1753.50s]  Rest assured the wretched thing will get the best of care here.
[1753.50s -> 1755.81s]  It's supposed to be funny, Jeremy.
[1755.81s -> 1758.30s]  It was!
[1758.30s -> 1761.06s]  By the way, I wonder if you have anything else
[1761.06s -> 1763.94s]  that could be donated. I do.
[1763.94s -> 1767.82s]  Here, take this.
[1767.82s -> 1772.35s]  Prussian carp.
[1772.35s -> 1774.35s]  Any facts
[1774.35s -> 1777.10s]  about the carp you want to know? No.
[1777.10s -> 1779.73s]  It's a fish.
[1779.73s -> 1786.62s]  It fucking eats algae. Cool.
[1786.62s -> 1793.34s]  13 more. This dude's going feral?
[1793.34s -> 1797.42s]  Why am I going feral?
[1797.42s -> 1799.42s]  Okay, I will get plenty. You know what?
[1799.42s -> 1801.60s]  I want...oops, don't do that.
[1801.60s -> 1805.87s]  Look at all these animals that I have out here.
[1805.87s -> 1810.35s]  I was going to clean up...okay, let's go.
[1810.35s -> 1820.21s]  We will get the lore of the hermit crab, I promise.
[1820.21s -> 1824.94s]  Why am I not an animal?
[1824.94s -> 1832.91s]  Hermit crab.
[1832.91s -> 1836.24s]  Hermit crab, ugh, what a wretched thing.
[1836.24s -> 1838.24s]  I don't like bugs. Hermit crab's not a bug?
[1838.24s -> 1841.68s]  Hold on. Hermit crab is not
[1841.68s -> 1845.46s]  a bug. It's like crustacean.
[1845.46s -> 1848.08s]  It's like a crab. It's not a bug?
[1848.08s -> 1853.31s]  Tell me about it. In that case,
[1853.31s -> 1856.38s]  ugh. Hermit crab is not an insect.
[1856.38s -> 1858.38s]  Well, it most certainly resembles one,
[1858.38s -> 1860.38s]  bleh. It looks much like a spider
[1860.38s -> 1862.38s]  with its creepy eyes and crawly legs,
[1862.38s -> 1864.94s]  but it is in fact a crustacean.
[1864.94s -> 1866.94s]  That sucks. The hermit crab has ten legs and also
[1866.94s -> 1868.94s]  wears a shell, but it doesn't grow this shell itself.
[1868.94s -> 1871.44s]  It slips its soft body...I mean, we're reading
[1871.44s -> 1873.44s]  a Wikipedia article about...that took the first
[1873.44s -> 1875.44s]  four lines of hermit crab
[1875.44s -> 1878.37s]  entry. We don't need to do this.
[1878.37s -> 1883.10s]  I know what a hermit crab is. Talk about a strange
[1883.10s -> 1885.10s]  way to make it. Anywho, thanks for the donation.
[1885.10s -> 1891.50s]  Any more donations? I think I have one more, yeah?
[1891.50s -> 1895.28s]  Yeah, take this.
[1895.28s -> 1899.74s]  Bag worm.
[1899.74s -> 1901.74s]  Let him do the job. He loves it.
[1901.74s -> 1904.11s]  No, he hates it apparently, because
[1904.11s -> 1906.99s]  he doesn't like any of these things.
[1906.99s -> 1911.71s]  Alright, you can read it. Here. It's caterpillar.
[1911.71s -> 1914.32s]  It uses silk.
[1914.32s -> 1919.04s]  It's very cute. It dangles.
[1921.04s -> 1923.04s]  They hide their bug bodies in
[1923.04s -> 1925.04s]  leaves. They eat trees.
[1925.04s -> 1927.04s]  They're villains.
[1927.04s -> 1931.44s]  Let me go.
[1931.44s -> 1954.78s]  Let me in.
[1954.78s -> 1956.78s]  Let me in.
[1956.78s -> 1959.79s]  Blathers, I've got more things for you.
[1959.79s -> 1962.86s]  Is Jerma's character the Joker?
[1962.86s -> 1974.58s]  I got a lot of stuff.
[1974.58s -> 1979.06s]  All I have are bugs and shit.
[1979.06s -> 1981.06s]  Alright, here's another centipede.
[1987.38s -> 1992.61s]  Sure, let's find out.
[1992.61s -> 1994.61s]  The centipede's name means one hundred
[1994.61s -> 1996.61s]  legs, but I tell you now, that's a lie.
[1996.61s -> 1998.61s]  These ugly bugs can have as few
[1998.61s -> 2000.61s]  as fifteen pairs, or as many
[2000.61s -> 2002.61s]  as a hundred and seventy-one.
[2002.61s -> 2004.85s]  Because of how their bodies are segmented,
[2004.85s -> 2006.85s]  they never have exactly a hundred.
[2006.85s -> 2008.85s]  Ooh, it's true.
[2008.85s -> 2010.85s]  You know what else is true? Centipedes are
[2010.85s -> 2012.85s]  carnivorous, aggressive, and venomous.
[2012.85s -> 2014.85s]  Their bite is quite painful too.
[2014.85s -> 2016.85s]  Horrible.
[2016.85s -> 2018.85s]  Anywho, my sincerest thanks
[2018.85s -> 2021.15s]  for your donation.
[2021.15s -> 2023.15s]  No bugs are the bane of my existence. Thank you.
[2023.15s -> 2025.15s]  Fun fact about centipedes.
[2025.15s -> 2027.15s]  If you see
[2027.15s -> 2029.78s]  a centipede,
[2029.78s -> 2031.78s]  you're supposed to leave it alone. The centipede
[2031.78s -> 2033.78s]  is such an aggressive psycho, it
[2033.78s -> 2035.78s]  will eat and kill all the other awful bugs
[2035.78s -> 2040.19s]  that are even near your property.
[2040.19s -> 2042.19s]  A centipede is like the ultimate
[2042.19s -> 2044.19s]  ultimate hunter.
[2044.19s -> 2046.43s]  And they kill like scorpions and shit,
[2046.43s -> 2048.43s]  and spiders, and just leave
[2048.43s -> 2050.43s]  those motherfuckers alone. Let them just
[2050.43s -> 2052.43s]  wreck havoc
[2052.43s -> 2054.43s]  on the pests that inhabit your house.
[2054.43s -> 2067.73s]  No one cares about centipedes.
[2067.73s -> 2069.73s]  I mean, I didn't tell you
[2069.73s -> 2071.73s]  to touch your tongue on it.
[2071.73s -> 2074.93s]  Just leave it alone.
[2074.93s -> 2076.93s]  If it's in your house, just get it out of your house.
[2076.93s -> 2078.93s]  But if you see one around your house, I don't know, just leave it alone.
[2078.93s -> 2083.66s]  I gotta bring most stuff.
[2083.66s -> 2087.70s]  Is this a fossil? Wait.
[2087.70s -> 2091.66s]  That's another fossil?
[2091.66s -> 2093.66s]  I need to get a shovel. Alright, back to the...
[2093.66s -> 2102.88s]  I gotta go sell. It was one in my room
[2102.88s -> 2105.31s]  last week. Man, it probably
[2105.31s -> 2107.31s]  wiped out the scary
[2107.31s -> 2109.31s]  spider collection that may have been
[2109.31s -> 2112.70s]  in your house. So you should just be thankful
[2112.70s -> 2121.02s]  of the centipede.
[2121.02s -> 2123.02s]  Hello. What would you like to talk to me about?
[2123.02s -> 2126.98s]  No, no, no. I'm good. Other person.
[2126.98s -> 2131.33s]  Team Spider.
[2131.33s -> 2136.26s]  Did I tell you? I saw
[2136.26s -> 2138.26s]  the... I said the
[2138.26s -> 2140.26s]  other day, but this is horseshit.
[2140.26s -> 2143.14s]  It was probably like six months ago.
[2143.14s -> 2145.14s]  I saw a
[2145.14s -> 2147.14s]  fake widow. Whatever they're called.
[2147.14s -> 2149.44s]  They're called like fraud widows.
[2149.44s -> 2151.94s]  They look like black widows.
[2151.94s -> 2153.94s]  They're big. Their legs are so terrifying.
[2153.94s -> 2156.37s]  It was terrifying. It was just outside.
[2156.37s -> 2159.50s]  Those things are
[2159.50s -> 2164.56s]  scary.
[2164.56s -> 2166.56s]  It's a fraud. Yeah, it's actually called like
[2166.56s -> 2172.00s]  fraud widow.
[2172.00s -> 2174.00s]  Proposal?
[2174.00s -> 2178.22s]  Proposal. Sure.
[2204.85s -> 2206.85s]  There it is.
[2210.85s -> 2214.35s]  False widow spider. There it is.
[2214.35s -> 2216.35s]  I'm getting drunk.
[2216.35s -> 2218.78s]  We'll need a lot of materials for proper
[2218.78s -> 2220.78s]  shops. So bring in wood and
[2220.78s -> 2222.78s]  stuff. Yeah, well, we'll do it.
[2222.78s -> 2228.86s]  Here's the items.
[2228.86s -> 2232.00s]  30 pieces of wood.
[2232.00s -> 2235.71s]  Wait, 90? 30 iron
[2235.71s -> 2237.71s]  uggets and 90 pieces of different wood.
[2237.71s -> 2241.68s]  Okay.
[2241.68s -> 2245.07s]  Holy shit, man.
[2245.07s -> 2248.72s]  All right. Well, here, I want to sell stuff.
[2248.72s -> 2250.72s]  Here, take this. I want to sell.
[2250.72s -> 2254.29s]  Let's get rid of
[2254.29s -> 2256.29s]  these.
[2256.29s -> 2259.36s]  These.
[2259.36s -> 2264.21s]  What else
[2264.21s -> 2270.21s]  should I get rid of?
[2270.21s -> 2273.34s]  I don't know what else to sell. Sell the weed?
[2273.34s -> 2275.34s]  Oh, I'm going to keep the weed.
[2275.34s -> 2277.34s]  Sell the nest too.
[2277.34s -> 2281.42s]  I guess so.
[2281.42s -> 2284.56s]  1,400 bills.
[2284.56s -> 2286.80s]  I got money in the
[2286.80s -> 2291.54s]  bank. Look, I got money in the bank.
[2291.54s -> 2301.90s]  I've got $5,500
[2301.90s -> 2304.14s]  in the bank. Loan payment.
[2304.14s -> 2306.38s]  Pay from savings. Let's do
[2306.38s -> 2308.38s]  $2,000 onto our loan.
[2308.38s -> 2316.77s]  When am I going to play Odama next?
[2316.77s -> 2320.14s]  I don't...
[2320.14s -> 2322.14s]  I'm not playing that game again.
[2322.14s -> 2328.22s]  You'll never see that game again.
[2328.22s -> 2335.89s]  Not happening.
[2335.89s -> 2337.89s]  Okay, so I need to find... I need to make
[2337.89s -> 2341.15s]  a shovel. Let's take and make a shovel.
[2341.15s -> 2343.71s]  Let's collect some stuff first.
[2343.71s -> 2345.71s]  There's a rock down here. Let me hit the rock.
[2345.71s -> 2348.27s]  I need a bunch of wood too.
[2348.27s -> 2351.02s]  Each tree has three wood.
[2351.02s -> 2353.02s]  Is that three wood a day?
[2353.02s -> 2357.95s]  I might be able to do the shop thing today.
[2357.95s -> 2368.94s]  I should probably not.
[2368.94s -> 2370.94s]  The wood's the easy part. Oh, I need the
[2370.94s -> 2380.48s]  iron. Should I talk to Phoebe?
[2380.48s -> 2384.37s]  Yo, Jeremy!
[2384.37s -> 2386.37s]  Hold on. I'll have time for you in a minute.
[2386.37s -> 2389.70s]  Get out of my way! Get out!
[2389.70s -> 2394.11s]  Stop! Get the fuck
[2394.11s -> 2396.11s]  out of my way. I've got stuff to do.
[2396.11s -> 2398.11s]  Oh my god, you've ruined everything.
[2398.11s -> 2404.32s]  Cool. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2404.32s -> 2406.32s]  Nice. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Cool. Thanks for the lunch.
[2406.32s -> 2408.32s]  I figured out how to make a lunch.
[2408.32s -> 2410.32s]  Okay, cool. You can make a shovel
[2410.32s -> 2412.32s]  now. Thank you. There's gold over there.
[2412.32s -> 2421.15s]  Okay, thank you.
[2421.15s -> 2423.15s]  I'm rude? I only have about five
[2423.15s -> 2425.15s]  seconds to hit this stuff. Thanks for the...
[2425.15s -> 2428.61s]  Thanks for that. I'm so rude.
[2428.61s -> 2430.61s]  No! I'm clearly working and they
[2430.61s -> 2432.61s]  got in my way. You don't go walk into a
[2432.61s -> 2434.61s]  guy swinging an axe and go, hey, I have a question
[2434.61s -> 2436.61s]  for you. Is my face too close to your
[2436.61s -> 2438.98s]  backswing? Get out of here.
[2438.98s -> 2454.59s]  I was rude.
[2454.59s -> 2457.79s]  I just gave you a shovel. Be more fucking
[2457.79s -> 2460.03s]  grateful.
[2460.03s -> 2462.03s]  Hey, now you're being rude
[2462.03s -> 2466.70s]  to me. It's a never
[2466.70s -> 2468.70s]  ending cycle of rudeness.
[2468.70s -> 2478.50s]  I'll see you guys next week for the City of Heroes
[2478.50s -> 2481.06s]  stream. That'll be fun.
[2481.06s -> 2484.58s]  We're gonna work together.
[2484.58s -> 2486.58s]  We're gonna have a superhero group of like
[2486.58s -> 2488.58s]  4,000 of us.
[2488.58s -> 2491.84s]  It'll be really cool. It'll be fun.
[2491.84s -> 2500.42s]  Gold nugget. Nice.
[2500.42s -> 2505.39s]  Alright, what does it take to make a shovel?
[2505.39s -> 2507.39s]  Here, I'll talk to you. I'm sorry.
[2507.39s -> 2511.04s]  Am I being pranked? Is there a hidden camera?
[2511.04s -> 2513.04s]  Let's talk.
[2513.04s -> 2516.11s]  That game is dead.
[2516.11s -> 2521.87s]  Omega lol.
[2521.87s -> 2523.87s]  Wait, the game doesn't even turn on.
[2523.87s -> 2526.56s]  Is the server gone?
[2526.56s -> 2529.18s]  The servers are gone. I can't even play it.
[2529.18s -> 2534.30s]  He's a
[2534.30s -> 2539.23s]  fan server. Okay.
[2539.23s -> 2541.23s]  There's a fan server. Well, I don't want to
[2541.23s -> 2543.23s]  diarrhea all over somebody's
[2543.23s -> 2545.23s]  fan server with like
[2545.23s -> 2547.23s]  5,000 fucking accounts made on it.
[2547.23s -> 2549.41s]  I'm not gonna do that.
[2549.41s -> 2552.74s]  You better invite me over soon.
[2552.74s -> 2562.72s]  Did I learn the shovel?
[2562.72s -> 2566.30s]  DIY? Play Champions Online?
[2566.30s -> 2578.78s]  Here we go.
[2578.78s -> 2580.78s]  It's hardwood. Shovel!
[2580.78s -> 2586.48s]  Let's have a sleepover.
[2586.48s -> 2591.79s]  Ooh, wait. I can make all this stuff.
[2591.79s -> 2594.93s]  I'm gonna make a little table.
[2594.93s -> 2602.91s]  And we're gonna make a mirror.
[2602.91s -> 2614.69s]  I have to have furniture in my house.
[2614.69s -> 2619.34s]  Alright, that's good for now. Okay.
[2619.34s -> 2621.34s]  Nook miles. What did I get?
[2621.34s -> 2624.10s]  I actually have a lot of miles.
[2624.10s -> 2629.92s]  5,000 is the inventory upgrade, right?
[2629.92s -> 2637.73s]  Furniture. Flower tender.
[2637.73s -> 2642.02s]  I almost set the inventory upgrade.
[2642.02s -> 2646.80s]  Very cool.
[2646.80s -> 2652.30s]  Okay. I need to make another axe.
[2652.30s -> 2655.31s]  Do I have enough for an axe?
[2655.31s -> 2657.62s]  That's a net. That's not an axe.
[2665.33s -> 2668.90s]  Okay. Do the pole.
[2668.90s -> 2673.63s]  Oh yeah, the pole vault, right?
[2673.63s -> 2677.02s]  New vaulting pole.
[2677.02s -> 2679.46s]  Pockets are too full. Shit.
[2679.46s -> 2683.68s]  I gotta get, hold on.
[2683.68s -> 2696.80s]  I gotta get this stuff in my house.
[2696.80s -> 2700.00s]  I gotta deposit some shit.
[2700.00s -> 2714.21s]  Okay, so mirror.
[2714.21s -> 2717.54s]  Turn the lights back on.
[2717.54s -> 2720.54s]  Wooden full length mirror.
[2720.54s -> 2722.54s]  Nice.
[2722.54s -> 2724.78s]  What can I do with it?
[2724.78s -> 2727.66s]  Can I change up my look?
[2727.66s -> 2731.12s]  What do you mean change up my look?
[2731.12s -> 2733.94s]  Oh, you can change your haircut and stuff?
[2733.94s -> 2739.18s]  That's kinda cool.
[2739.18s -> 2741.68s]  Alright.
[2741.68s -> 2744.37s]  A little table.
[2744.37s -> 2746.37s]  Nice.
[2746.37s -> 2748.37s]  And a elephants slide.
[2748.37s -> 2763.15s]  Put the elephants slide down here.
[2763.15s -> 2766.42s]  I'll plant an apple.
[2766.42s -> 2769.23s]  Actually, I'll plant two apple trees.
[2769.23s -> 2776.34s]  Why not?
[2776.34s -> 2778.34s]  Alright, this looks like a fucking temple.
[2778.34s -> 2782.62s]  World of slides.
[2782.62s -> 2784.62s]  Alright, now...
[2784.62s -> 2786.62s]  I wanna go back.
[2786.62s -> 2788.62s]  Make the pole and go across the river.
[2788.62s -> 2798.99s]  The people want 30 minutes slow mode.
[2798.99s -> 2802.45s]  I don't think they do.
[2802.45s -> 2805.39s]  I'm not sure they do.
[2805.39s -> 2813.74s]  Okay.
[2813.74s -> 2817.20s]  It begins.
[2817.20s -> 2819.20s]  So, I wanna go help Donald Duck first.
[2819.20s -> 2823.30s]  I'll head down there.
[2823.30s -> 2826.24s]  Wait.
[2826.24s -> 2845.10s]  Come on.
[2845.10s -> 2851.38s]  That kinda was a bad haul.
[2851.38s -> 2856.75s]  Suboptimal grinding.
[2856.75s -> 2858.75s]  I'm not gonna do 30 minutes slow mode.
[2858.75s -> 2860.75s]  No, why would I do that?
[2860.75s -> 2863.12s]  Flimsy shovel and shovel.
[2863.12s -> 2879.18s]  Okay, so I have to do
[2879.18s -> 2881.18s]  look for holes, things to dig on the beach?
[2881.18s -> 2883.62s]  Oh, the bird gave me the shovel.
[2883.62s -> 2886.11s]  Didn't you say my stuff's on the beach?
[2886.11s -> 2889.76s]  Pole vault over here?
[2889.76s -> 2894.99s]  How do you pole vault?
[2894.99s -> 2904.53s]  Use the shovel on the rock.
[2904.53s -> 2919.76s]  Use the shovel on the rock.
[2919.76s -> 2927.74s]  Damn. Wow.
[2927.74s -> 2929.74s]  Holy shit, that one had like 4000.
[2929.74s -> 2945.23s]  Dig a hole behind you
[2945.23s -> 2948.75s]  so you don't get recoiled.
[2948.75s -> 2950.75s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[2950.75s -> 2970.32s]  I'm back here.
[2970.32s -> 2977.22s]  That thing was huge.
[2977.22s -> 2979.22s]  How do I use the pole vault?
[2979.22s -> 2991.17s]  It has to be equipped?
[2991.17s -> 2996.16s]  Oh, hold it.
[2996.16s -> 3000.64s]  Alright, nice. Here we go.
[3000.64s -> 3003.65s]  Here we go.
[3003.65s -> 3010.18s]  Oh, I'll plant apple trees over here.
[3010.18s -> 3013.76s]  Yeah, I'm gonna plant some trees here.
[3013.76s -> 3027.25s]  Okay. Apples. Plant.
[3027.25s -> 3031.09s]  Cool.
[3031.09s -> 3033.39s]  And then we do
[3033.39s -> 3035.39s]  how far apart do they have to be?
[3035.39s -> 3037.39s]  Does it matter? How far apart can I do whatever?
[3037.39s -> 3040.08s]  Will this work? Can I do it here?
[3040.08s -> 3045.12s]  I can do it right there, right?
[3045.12s -> 3047.12s]  It doesn't matter? It just does? Okay, cool.
[3047.12s -> 3055.17s]  I'm gonna have an apple garden.
[3055.17s -> 3057.17s]  Just at least one space.
[3057.17s -> 3067.26s]  Do I have to water them?
[3067.26s -> 3072.83s]  I would assume, right?
[3072.83s -> 3080.70s]  Trees don't need water. Oh, okay.
[3080.70s -> 3082.70s]  Am I gonna play Smite after this?
[3082.70s -> 3087.31s]  That's something I haven't heard in a very, very, very long time.
[3087.31s -> 3094.29s]  Dude, you're gonna play
[3094.29s -> 3102.22s]  Smite after this?
[3102.22s -> 3104.85s]  Alright, I'm gonna
[3104.85s -> 3106.85s]  make, okay, I've got three apple trees.
[3106.85s -> 3110.43s]  Oh shit, there's a lot of stuff over here.
[3110.43s -> 3113.49s]  Crap. I already have one of those
[3113.49s -> 3118.99s]  though. I don't even want it.
[3118.99s -> 3121.49s]  That's a huge fish. Huge fish.
[3121.49s -> 3124.54s]  I don't have any money.
[3124.54s -> 3127.36s]  I gotta get that space upgrade.
[3127.36s -> 3129.36s]  Alright, do I have enough for the upgrade?
[3129.36s -> 3133.26s]  I think I do. It's 5,000, right?
[3133.26s -> 3143.55s]  Come on. Come on. 500.
[3143.55s -> 3151.66s]  Ugh. What do I need to get there?
[3151.66s -> 3154.93s]  I need...
[3154.93s -> 3158.18s]  That's an easy one. Just take a...
[3158.18s -> 3160.18s]  Just take a picture. Alright, just take any photo.
[3160.18s -> 3171.06s]  Alright, I'm gonna go get the inventory upgrade.
[3171.06s -> 3179.31s]  That's the plan.
[3179.31s -> 3191.20s]  Boomer selfie.
[3191.20s -> 3193.20s]  I don't know why I'm laughing at that because I don't even know what that means.
[3193.20s -> 3196.40s]  Take the bulletin board. What's this?
[3196.40s -> 3198.64s]  Free stuff tomorrow only at Tom Nook's house.
[3198.64s -> 3200.64s]  Just go in. It's fine. Take anything.
[3200.64s -> 3202.64s]  Sign Tom Nook.
[3202.64s -> 3204.64s]  Well, that's...
[3204.64s -> 3208.29s]  That's still valid?
[3208.29s -> 3222.50s]  Is it still open?
[3222.50s -> 3227.68s]  5,000 miles.
[3227.68s -> 3229.68s]  A pocket organization guide.
[3229.68s -> 3231.86s]  I will take it.
[3231.86s -> 3236.27s]  Thank you.
[3236.27s -> 3238.27s]  Are we actually on 30 minute slow mode? Why?
[3238.27s -> 3240.58s]  We should not be on
[3240.58s -> 3244.99s]  30 minute slow mode.
[3244.99s -> 3246.99s]  I don't want to be on 30 minute slow mode.
[3246.99s -> 3252.69s]  I learned some tricks for organizing
[3252.69s -> 3254.69s]  my belongings. I can carry a bit more stuff.
[3254.69s -> 3256.99s]  Holy shit, that's
[3256.99s -> 3260.00s]  so much better.
[3260.00s -> 3263.01s]  I can actually breathe.
[3263.01s -> 3265.01s]  Is it an almond or Wi-Fi?
[3265.01s -> 3275.12s]  It's Wi-Fi.
[3275.12s -> 3283.12s]  Wait, it was actually on.
[3283.12s -> 3285.94s]  Alright, now I have some room for this shit.
[3285.94s -> 3287.94s]  And then I want to store
[3287.94s -> 3291.97s]  the other things.
[3291.97s -> 3297.73s]  I need storage.
[3297.73s -> 3305.90s]  What do I do? Put it back.
[3305.90s -> 3308.46s]  You have the ability
[3308.46s -> 3310.46s]  to speak now and you want it taken away
[3310.46s -> 3312.46s]  from you? Why do you want that?
[3312.46s -> 3317.20s]  You don't actually want that.
[3317.20s -> 3319.20s]  You sound like a cam girl
[3319.20s -> 3322.98s]  when she reads messages.
[3322.98s -> 3324.98s]  What the fuck does that even mean?
[3324.98s -> 3334.19s]  What?
[3334.19s -> 3337.14s]  I don't even know what that means.
[3337.14s -> 3339.82s]  What are you talking about?
[3339.82s -> 3344.75s]  True though, that's true.
[3344.75s -> 3347.44s]  What the fuck
[3347.44s -> 3350.19s]  are you talking about?
[3350.19s -> 3352.19s]  I don't even know what that reference is.
[3352.19s -> 3355.71s]  I know what
[3355.71s -> 3357.71s]  it is. I don't know what
[3357.71s -> 3362.51s]  what did I say?
[3362.51s -> 3379.98s]  It's so true. It's true. What are you talking about?
[3379.98s -> 3389.01s]  I think it's just how people read messages
[3389.01s -> 3394.45s]  in general. I got dressed for this shit.
[3394.45s -> 3396.82s]  What does that mean?
[3396.82s -> 3401.68s]  Earlier, I don't want to use
[3401.68s -> 3407.06s]  face cam.
[3407.06s -> 3409.62s]  Look at me.
[3409.62s -> 3413.26s]  Naked frame. Play Smite.
[3413.26s -> 3421.26s]  The people have spoken. The people
[3421.26s -> 3423.26s]  have spoken. Play Nancy Drew
[3423.26s -> 3425.26s]  while you swallow a disc
[3425.26s -> 3427.26s]  of smite. Installation disc
[3427.26s -> 3440.00s]  one of four.
[3440.00s -> 3442.00s]  I didn't store my items.
[3442.00s -> 3448.14s]  Store your shit. I know, I'm being
[3448.14s -> 3450.14s]  distracted by people saying
[3450.14s -> 3452.14s]  things about me. They're saying
[3452.14s -> 3454.45s]  things about me.
[3454.45s -> 3461.36s]  They're saying things about me.
[3461.36s -> 3465.58s]  Store this. Store this.
[3465.58s -> 3471.07s]  Store the clay. Store the stones.
[3471.07s -> 3475.41s]  Stones. Yes, I'll
[3475.41s -> 3479.94s]  get the stones.
[3479.94s -> 3483.84s]  Yes, my lord, I will.
[3483.84s -> 3494.02s]  I will get the stones.
[3494.02s -> 3505.41s]  Do I need any of this other shit? Can you
[3505.41s -> 3507.41s]  imagine
[3507.41s -> 3509.41s]  not seeing a bunch of movies and not
[3509.41s -> 3511.41s]  knowing what the fifth element is? Imagine
[3511.41s -> 3513.41s]  not seeing a bunch of movies. You took the Universal
[3513.41s -> 3515.41s]  fucking Studios quiz. You don't
[3515.41s -> 3528.59s]  know movies? Imagine?
[3528.59s -> 3534.54s]  It's a great movie. All right, so
[3534.54s -> 3538.13s]  I need to go on
[3538.13s -> 3541.26s]  a flash. I need to watch
[3541.26s -> 3543.26s]  more movies. German walk.
[3543.26s -> 3550.50s]  What's a stack of
[3550.50s -> 3553.63s]  fruits? It's one stack of fruits.
[3553.63s -> 3555.63s]  10, 20, 30.
[3555.63s -> 3561.46s]  Oh, look at those up
[3561.46s -> 3564.14s]  there. Rock
[3564.14s -> 3570.02s]  40. I feel like that's different from the last
[3570.02s -> 3573.15s]  one. All right, here's somebody.
[3573.15s -> 3575.15s]  This is a strategy, right? You do one behind
[3575.15s -> 3577.15s]  you so you can't be bounced back. Is this the strategy?
[3577.15s -> 3579.52s]  It is.
[3579.52s -> 3585.28s]  Oh, you fucking can't be serious.
[3585.28s -> 3596.16s]  I got some iron, though.
[3596.16s -> 3604.66s]  Watched it.
[3604.66s -> 3606.66s]  What's over here? Lots of stuff.
[3606.66s -> 3611.20s]  No, stop it. I want to just shake it.
[3611.20s -> 3613.63s]  Two diagonally by two holes.
[3613.63s -> 3621.12s]  Okay.
[3621.12s -> 3624.70s]  Whole back seating. I distinctly
[3624.70s -> 3626.70s]  saw three peaches drop
[3626.70s -> 3628.70s]  and only one of them was collectible.
[3628.70s -> 3636.69s]  What's that?
[3636.69s -> 3638.93s]  I dug up a fossil.
[3638.93s -> 3642.00s]  Oh, cool.
[3642.00s -> 3652.50s]  Any fish in here? This is worth 20.
[3652.50s -> 3656.91s]  That's rare. Everything is rare
[3656.91s -> 3662.74s]  in this game, don't you know? I make a lot of money
[3662.74s -> 3674.38s]  from peaches. It's worth $90,000.
[3674.38s -> 3679.57s]  What?
[3679.57s -> 3689.17s]  That's pretty cool. This time
[3689.17s -> 3695.30s]  I'm ready. Got you.
[3695.30s -> 3697.30s]  Don't touch it.
[3697.30s -> 3699.30s]  I caught a tarantula. The situation just got hairy.
[3699.30s -> 3704.10s]  Let's get some more fish
[3704.10s -> 3706.10s]  to bring to the guy.
[3706.10s -> 3727.20s]  I caught a loach
[3727.20s -> 3733.09s]  looking at me with reproach.
[3733.09s -> 3735.33s]  What about this one?
[3735.33s -> 3737.33s]  What else is on this little island?
[3737.33s -> 3741.87s]  Two more spots. Nice.
[3741.87s -> 3745.52s]  Fossil.
[3745.52s -> 3747.82s]  Fossil and
[3747.82s -> 3754.10s]  two more fossils.
[3754.10s -> 3756.10s]  This game is terrible for joke
[3756.10s -> 3760.19s]  stunks.
[3760.19s -> 3763.14s]  Yeah, but we've got to remember
[3763.14s -> 3765.57s]  sometimes it's not about the jokes.
[3765.57s -> 3769.02s]  Sometimes it's about shaking trees.
[3769.02s -> 3771.52s]  Picking up apples on the ground.
[3771.52s -> 3773.82s]  Sometimes it's not about the jokes.
[3773.82s -> 3777.15s]  Sometimes it's about sending
[3777.15s -> 3779.71s]  a message.
[3779.71s -> 3781.71s]  Why did you make me do that?
[3781.71s -> 3784.34s]  It's always about the jokes.
[3784.34s -> 3786.34s]  It's not always about the jokes. Sometimes it's about
[3786.34s -> 3788.34s]  just, it's not always
[3788.34s -> 3793.39s]  about the joke. Look, if it was only
[3793.39s -> 3795.39s]  joke, I could get joke exhaustion.
[3795.39s -> 3810.05s]  Alright, well I got a bunch of stuff.
[3810.05s -> 3812.05s]  Let's go talk to the, uh, wait.
[3812.05s -> 3822.29s]  Is he sentient rock?
[3822.29s -> 3835.97s]  Wouldn't that be something?
[3835.97s -> 3838.78s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[3838.78s -> 3840.78s]  No, no, no, no, no. Can you eat the grass?
[3840.78s -> 3860.48s]  I'm going to blathers.
[3860.48s -> 3862.48s]  Balloon present. Balloon present. Balloon alert.
[3862.48s -> 3881.55s]  Attention streamer. I wasn't looking.
[3881.55s -> 3883.55s]  What's in it? Hopefully it's a fossil.
[3883.55s -> 3886.69s]  Bunch of clay. Eh, that's pretty good.
[3886.69s -> 3889.06s]  I only had one.
[3889.06s -> 3910.03s]  Rare clay? Alright blathers
[3910.03s -> 3912.03s]  I got some fossils for you.
[3912.03s -> 3914.91s]  I do.
[3914.91s -> 3922.24s]  Take this. Does he dust it off?
[3922.24s -> 3924.24s]  Let me know that this is a fossil.
[3924.24s -> 3926.24s]  Incredible. Wonderful. Remarkable. My intuition
[3926.24s -> 3928.24s]  was impeccable. There are fossils
[3928.24s -> 3930.61s]  on this island. Back to
[3930.61s -> 3932.61s]  the matter at Wing. I must assess your
[3932.61s -> 3934.61s]  fabulous find. Let me see here. Hmm.
[3934.61s -> 3938.19s]  I can declare
[3938.19s -> 3940.19s]  this to be a left
[3940.19s -> 3944.16s]  Magello slide. My feathers.
[3944.16s -> 3946.16s]  What a fabulous fossil. This left
[3946.16s -> 3948.16s]  Magello side would be a sizable
[3948.16s -> 3950.16s]  step toward opening the museum.
[3950.16s -> 3952.46s]  I wonder, would you perhaps consider donating this
[3952.46s -> 3954.46s]  to the cause?
[3954.46s -> 3958.94s]  Yes. I'll add this to the collection.
[3958.94s -> 3960.94s]  I wouldn't add your light shapes to my collection.
[3960.94s -> 3963.25s]  I never thought I'd
[3963.25s -> 3965.25s]  say I'd lay eyes on this bunch of
[3965.25s -> 3967.25s]  preserved left Magello
[3967.25s -> 3969.25s]  side.
[3969.25s -> 3971.42s]  Dear me, I might have to give you a short
[3971.42s -> 3973.42s]  presentation on the topic. Ah, no.
[3973.42s -> 3976.54s]  Uh, sure.
[3976.54s -> 3979.10s]  Wonderful.
[3979.10s -> 3981.10s]  It's fascinating stuff. I assure you. Now, where to begin?
[3981.10s -> 3983.79s]  The Megalosaurus
[3983.79s -> 3985.79s]  was a relative of the deer that
[3985.79s -> 3987.79s]  lived during the Ice Age, long after
[3987.79s -> 3989.79s]  the dinosaurs. It was also known as
[3989.79s -> 3991.79s]  Megaloceros giganteos,
[3991.79s -> 3993.79s]  which just means deer with
[3993.79s -> 3995.79s]  large horns. True to their name,
[3995.79s -> 3997.79s]  they were deer with antlers spanning roughly 10
[3997.79s -> 4000.99s]  feet across. Imagine the majesty.
[4000.99s -> 4002.99s]  While smaller than many dinosaurs, they were
[4002.99s -> 4004.99s]  nonetheless a very charismatic example of
[4004.99s -> 4008.06s]  megafauna. And that is what I have to say
[4008.06s -> 4010.06s]  about that. Anywho, I'll take it.
[4010.06s -> 4012.88s]  He's doing it on purpose.
[4012.88s -> 4014.88s]  He has to be doing it on purpose.
[4014.88s -> 4019.68s]  He has to be.
[4019.68s -> 4024.16s]  Oh, Megalosaurus.
[4024.16s -> 4026.16s]  Only a specialist can appraise a newly
[4026.16s -> 4030.19s]  discovered fossil.
[4030.19s -> 4032.75s]  Whether you choose to donate is up to
[4032.75s -> 4034.75s]  you. I will assess it.
[4034.75s -> 4038.14s]  Okay.
[4038.14s -> 4046.26s]  What about this bug?
[4046.26s -> 4049.31s]  A tarantula.
[4049.31s -> 4052.94s]  Let's learn. In that case,
[4052.94s -> 4054.94s]  as spiders go, the tarantula is said to
[4054.94s -> 4056.94s]  be quite docile. But have you ever seen
[4056.94s -> 4058.94s]  such foul fuzziness?
[4058.94s -> 4064.83s]  They're barbed, I tell you.
[4064.83s -> 4066.83s]  These awful arachnids let
[4066.83s -> 4068.83s]  loose their spiky, itchy hairs to protect themselves
[4068.83s -> 4070.83s]  from predators. But seeing how
[4070.83s -> 4072.83s]  tarantulas also prey on frogs, mice, and even
[4072.83s -> 4074.83s]  birds, one must ask,
[4074.83s -> 4077.20s]  who needs protecting from whom?
[4077.20s -> 4079.38s]  Who, indeed?
[4079.38s -> 4081.62s]  Anywho, my serious thanks.
[4081.62s -> 4083.62s]  They eat frogs. That's what they do. That's fucked up.
[4083.62s -> 4098.06s]  I got this thing. A loach.
[4098.06s -> 4101.58s]  I don't care.
[4101.58s -> 4103.58s]  So hold on, the fossil that I dug up, that
[4103.58s -> 4105.58s]  the Magellan stone,
[4105.58s -> 4107.58s]  whatever it was called,
[4107.58s -> 4109.58s]  can I now sell that?
[4109.58s -> 4112.53s]  I don't have to give it to him anymore?
[4112.53s -> 4129.94s]  You can sell it off and get it again.
[4129.94s -> 4131.94s]  Place it.
[4131.94s -> 4135.97s]  Place the fossil.
[4135.97s -> 4142.67s]  He's donating. Why do you have
[4142.67s -> 4144.91s]  Why do I place it?
[4144.91s -> 4151.76s]  Place it, like, up here?
[4151.76s -> 4154.45s]  Outside. On the ground?
[4154.45s -> 4164.67s]  I already donated it.
[4164.67s -> 4166.67s]  I keep giving him fossils, but I couldn't select it.
[4166.67s -> 4170.96s]  If you get it again. No, you did not.
[4170.96s -> 4172.96s]  What?
[4172.96s -> 4174.96s]  All the fossils were grayed out when I just talked to him.
[4174.96s -> 4180.66s]  What are you talking about?
[4180.66s -> 4182.66s]  Wait, he has to assess the fossil first, then you can donate it.
[4182.66s -> 4193.54s]  Assess fossils? Okay.
[4195.71s -> 4198.91s]  Here, look at this.
[4198.91s -> 4201.86s]  Take them both. Sometimes it's automatically
[4201.86s -> 4203.86s]  donated.
[4203.86s -> 4208.34s]  What do we got?
[4208.34s -> 4215.06s]  These are rare fossils.
[4215.06s -> 4227.26s]  What are they? What are they?
[4227.26s -> 4235.58s]  T-Rex skull. How did I bring this in here?
[4235.58s -> 4238.02s]  T-Rex skull?
[4238.02s -> 4240.64s]  I never thought I'd say it. Wait a minute.
[4240.64s -> 4242.64s]  Hear me, I might give you a short presentation.
[4242.64s -> 4244.64s]  How much can I sell a T-Rex skull for?
[4244.64s -> 4249.06s]  I know what a T-Rex is.
[4249.06s -> 4251.06s]  I'm busy.
[4251.06s -> 4257.31s]  Don't put it outside.
[4257.31s -> 4259.31s]  Hold on. Put it outside?
[4259.31s -> 4261.31s]  Wait, it's a hundred thousand bells
[4261.31s -> 4271.68s]  to sell it?
[4271.68s -> 4280.77s]  Place it down.
[4280.77s -> 4284.59s]  Where is it?
[4284.59s -> 4287.73s]  Oh.
[4287.73s -> 4289.73s]  It doesn't show up on the ground.
[4305.46s -> 4307.46s]  No, I know it's not the right one.
[4307.46s -> 4310.34s]  Alright, this is the Archaopteryx.
[4310.34s -> 4313.54s]  Archaopteryx.
[4313.54s -> 4315.84s]  Archaopteryx.
[4315.84s -> 4318.02s]  Archaopteryx.
[4318.02s -> 4322.80s]  Take it.
[4322.80s -> 4324.80s]  Could it be? It is an Archaopteryx.
[4324.80s -> 4328.58s]  It's so preserved. Thank you.
[4328.58s -> 4331.26s]  What is this thing?
[4331.26s -> 4333.26s]  A skull of a dinosaur. Cool.
[4337.54s -> 4341.10s]  I only need five more.
[4341.10s -> 4343.10s]  So I need to give...
[4343.10s -> 4352.77s]  Let's go back out and explore.
[4352.77s -> 4354.77s]  I still need to do your thing.
[4354.77s -> 4356.77s]  Hey, communicative parts.
[4356.77s -> 4358.77s]  Come out, wherever you are.
[4358.77s -> 4360.77s]  I'll answer what it is. It's like they've all clammed up all of a sudden.
[4360.77s -> 4364.29s]  Buried their heads in the sand.
[4364.29s -> 4369.34s]  Am I responding to him?
[4369.34s -> 4372.35s]  Right.
[4372.35s -> 4376.77s]  What am I typing this for?
[4376.77s -> 4386.86s]  Buried in the sand.
[4386.86s -> 4391.41s]  What was that?
[4391.41s -> 4394.42s]  Excuse me.
[4394.42s -> 4405.66s]  Communicator part.
[4405.66s -> 4409.12s]  Communicator part.
[4409.12s -> 4418.00s]  5G chip.
[4418.00s -> 4421.46s]  And the others.
[4421.46s -> 4425.68s]  The little water spouts.
[4425.68s -> 4435.07s]  I need five, right?
[4435.07s -> 4440.83s]  The profit is infected with 5G.
[4440.83s -> 4443.58s]  No more.
[4443.58s -> 4451.14s]  Other beach, yeah.
[4451.14s -> 4463.09s]  Go this way.
[4463.09s -> 4465.09s]  Okay, give me more of these clams.
[4465.09s -> 4468.67s]  I want that fish too. Yeah, give me this fish.
[4468.67s -> 4481.28s]  Good guy.
[4481.28s -> 4483.52s]  I caught a red snapper.
[4483.52s -> 4495.49s]  It looks pretty dapper.
[4495.49s -> 4498.56s]  Come on, little water spout.
[4498.56s -> 4506.22s]  No?
[4506.22s -> 4525.15s]  Come on.
[4525.15s -> 4543.57s]  Nothing.
[4543.57s -> 4550.91s]  Bug spotted.
[4550.91s -> 4552.91s]  That's okay.
[4552.91s -> 4554.91s]  Go get the bugs.
[4554.91s -> 4568.91s]  Bugs, bugs, bugs.
[4568.91s -> 4579.84s]  Hey, no bug?
[4579.84s -> 4596.27s]  Hey, I see a tinted rock.
[4596.27s -> 4609.38s]  Come on.
[4609.38s -> 4636.05s]  Come on.
[4636.05s -> 4647.22s]  Get it. Here it comes.
[4647.22s -> 4649.22s]  That's going to float out right in front of him, really?
[4649.22s -> 4655.04s]  I fucking can't believe
[4655.04s -> 4657.47s]  that just happened.
[4657.47s -> 4659.71s]  My sweaty ass hand just hit the button.
[4659.71s -> 4661.71s]  It was there.
[4661.71s -> 4663.71s]  Again,
[4663.71s -> 4665.71s]  I'm going to say this again and I know people are going to be like,
[4665.71s -> 4667.71s]  I know here it comes again.
[4667.71s -> 4669.71s]  You can press every single switch button with your thumb.
[4669.71s -> 4671.95s]  Every single one.
[4671.95s -> 4673.95s]  Every single button on the switch controller
[4673.95s -> 4688.54s]  is going to be pressed with one thumb.
[4688.54s -> 4690.98s]  All right, bug on rock.
[4690.98s -> 4692.98s]  He's not using the pro controller.
[4692.98s -> 4699.18s]  I'm not a pro.
[4699.18s -> 4701.18s]  Where's this bug on rock, as you were describing down?
[4701.18s -> 4719.71s]  Hey, look at that.
[4719.71s -> 4724.00s]  Middle of the island on the big black rock.
[4724.00s -> 4729.18s]  I'll get the net out preemptively.
[4729.18s -> 4731.18s]  Up left, big rock.
[4731.18s -> 4740.14s]  Up here? I don't see any bugs.
[4740.14s -> 4762.53s]  He's fishing in really weird spots.
[4762.53s -> 4772.70s]  It's right next to his turn.
[4772.70s -> 4774.70s]  North bug.
[4774.70s -> 4782.83s]  Bug on chair.
[4782.83s -> 4801.58s]  Of course he turns to the left the second I do that shit.
[4801.58s -> 4805.30s]  The horse mackerel, of course.
[4805.30s -> 4810.10s]  The bug is behind you.
[4810.10s -> 4812.46s]  Looking for another bug.
[4812.46s -> 4821.30s]  Found him. Bugs.
[4821.30s -> 4823.30s]  Yes, I got a wharf roach.
[4823.30s -> 4827.82s]  Wow.
[4827.82s -> 4838.11s]  Wow. Whoa.
[4838.11s -> 4841.70s]  That was nice. That's cool.
[4841.70s -> 4843.70s]  All right, one more and then we're going to go donate.
[4858.67s -> 4861.30s]  Yes. Yes, I finally got it.
[4861.30s -> 4864.11s]  I got it. I finally got it.
[4864.11s -> 4866.61s]  Thank God it took so long.
[4866.61s -> 4869.81s]  That took so long.
[4869.81s -> 4871.81s]  Yes.
[4871.81s -> 4888.58s]  Yes.
[4888.58s -> 4890.58s]  Oh, I'm never going to delete that. That's going to stay there forever.
[4890.58s -> 4899.34s]  How do I get up there?
[4899.34s -> 4911.49s]  New sub zone.
[4911.49s -> 4921.86s]  Big guy.
[4921.86s -> 4925.18s]  Come back. Put the pole in your
[4925.18s -> 4928.64s]  pool ring.
[4928.64s -> 4936.90s]  I knew you could do that.
[4936.90s -> 4958.08s]  All right, let's go give Donald Duck his
[4958.08s -> 4972.54s]  communicator parts. My pockets are full.
[4972.54s -> 4981.38s]  Uh oh. Drop it.
[4981.38s -> 4983.38s]  Drop the fucking sea snail.
[4983.38s -> 4985.55s]  I don't even want this thing.
[4985.55s -> 4989.71s]  Uh oh.
[4989.71s -> 4992.72s]  Come on.
[4992.72s -> 4994.72s]  Uh oh. I want to say it, but I
[4994.72s -> 4996.72s]  don't want to.
[4996.72s -> 4999.86s]  Do you know what I mean? I want to say it,
[4999.86s -> 5001.86s]  but I don't want to. I don't even want to.
[5001.86s -> 5003.86s]  Uh oh.
[5003.86s -> 5005.86s]  I don't know why I feel like saying this
[5005.86s -> 5007.86s]  right now. I hate that word.
[5007.86s -> 5009.86s]  The way that he says it,
[5009.86s -> 5011.86s]  it's fucked up.
[5011.86s -> 5017.94s]  It's fucking me up.
[5017.94s -> 5019.94s]  What did I just bury?
[5019.94s -> 5022.54s]  I'm begging you.
[5022.54s -> 5026.69s]  I'm going to turn off the mic
[5026.69s -> 5028.99s]  and I'm going to do it for me.
[5028.99s -> 5030.99s]  I had to do that for me.
[5030.99s -> 5037.84s]  I don't want this.
[5037.84s -> 5041.10s]  It was a private one.
[5041.10s -> 5063.06s]  Please watch it.
[5063.06s -> 5065.06s]  I've seen the video by now.
[5065.06s -> 5067.23s]  I don't live under a rock.
[5067.23s -> 5069.23s]  I've seen it.
[5069.23s -> 5071.23s]  Talk to Blathers.
[5071.23s -> 5077.63s]  He watches it every day.
[5077.63s -> 5097.41s]  I've got something for you to
[5097.41s -> 5100.35s]  assume.
[5100.35s -> 5102.35s]  I have something that I want you to
[5102.35s -> 5106.13s]  assume.
[5106.13s -> 5112.98s]  Poop guy not in chat
[5112.98s -> 5114.98s]  anymore. No, he's not. He got like banned.
[5114.98s -> 5117.60s]  Like the Poopoo BLT
[5117.60s -> 5119.60s]  guy is gone. I don't think you'll be seeing
[5119.60s -> 5122.80s]  him in chat again. Oh, it's a
[5122.80s -> 5124.80s]  Megasero torso.
[5124.80s -> 5126.98s]  You can have it.
[5126.98s -> 5146.18s]  Listen to the description, please.
[5146.18s -> 5151.87s]  I don't know.
[5151.87s -> 5153.87s]  I wonder if you have anything else. Do I? I don't think I do.
[5153.87s -> 5156.88s]  I actually, yeah,
[5156.88s -> 5159.38s]  I do. I got bugs and shit.
[5159.38s -> 5161.62s]  Fucking roach.
[5161.62s -> 5166.98s]  Tell me about the roach.
[5166.98s -> 5168.98s]  I see, in that case.
[5168.98s -> 5170.98s]  Wharf roach is an omnivore, which is merely a polite way of
[5170.98s -> 5172.98s]  saying it will eat almost anything.
[5172.98s -> 5175.92s]  This skittering scavenger
[5175.92s -> 5177.92s]  and its uncouth
[5177.92s -> 5179.92s]  appetite help keep beaches clean.
[5179.92s -> 5181.92s]  It's said.
[5181.92s -> 5183.92s]  I dare say their long antennae and bulging
[5183.92s -> 5185.92s]  eyes burn my stomach.
[5185.92s -> 5187.92s]  Unappetizing indeed.
[5187.92s -> 5189.92s]  What is the Poopoo bit? Somebody came in here
[5189.92s -> 5191.92s]  and said that they were eating a BLT
[5191.92s -> 5193.92s]  shit sandwich or something and they
[5193.92s -> 5195.92s]  made everybody lose their fucking minds.
[5195.92s -> 5197.92s]  Chat went nuts. I went nuts. It was a huge
[5197.92s -> 5200.74s]  problem. We're calling it
[5200.74s -> 5202.74s]  the BLT shit sandwich scenario
[5202.74s -> 5204.74s]  of fucking 2020.
[5204.74s -> 5220.03s]  Can I do multiple donations?
[5220.03s -> 5224.70s]  I can't do multiple donations at the same time.
[5224.70s -> 5229.38s]  This is a horse mackerel.
[5229.38s -> 5233.47s]  Do you want some facts?
[5233.47s -> 5236.93s]  I almost have enough for the museum.
[5236.93s -> 5239.36s]  Three more? Two more?
[5239.36s -> 5244.34s]  And
[5244.34s -> 5247.73s]  ooh, this big guy. Red snapper.
[5247.73s -> 5254.05s]  We'll get the facts on the snapper.
[5254.05s -> 5256.05s]  Give us some facts. Hit us with the facts.
[5256.05s -> 5259.25s]  Red snapper is the common name of dozens of
[5259.25s -> 5261.25s]  fish species and I wonder why it's so popular.
[5261.25s -> 5263.25s]  There's so many types of fish that are
[5263.25s -> 5265.25s]  both a shade of red and have a tendency to
[5265.25s -> 5268.32s]  snap? Were there no other names?
[5268.32s -> 5270.32s]  What about...
[5270.32s -> 5272.32s]  What about...
[5272.32s -> 5274.32s]  What about...
[5274.32s -> 5276.50s]  Uh, garnet...
[5276.50s -> 5278.86s]  Brasper? Fuse? Pinscher?
[5278.86s -> 5282.90s]  There you have it. Fascinating
[5282.90s -> 5286.98s]  stuff.
[5286.98s -> 5288.98s]  Once the museum is complete, there you go.
[5288.98s -> 5293.20s]  One more donation.
[5293.20s -> 5301.38s]  And that's it. The crack stream.
[5301.38s -> 5304.64s]  They're all crack streams.
[5304.64s -> 5307.39s]  Hey, uh,
[5307.39s -> 5315.78s]  look what I did.
[5315.78s -> 5321.78s]  I'm gonna click on it.
[5321.78s -> 5323.78s]  Yeah, sure.
[5323.78s -> 5335.15s]  There it is.
[5335.15s -> 5337.15s]  And you don't think
[5337.15s -> 5339.15s]  that person should have
[5339.15s -> 5341.15s]  received the 25 minute timeout.
[5341.15s -> 5343.15s]  For something like that.
[5343.15s -> 5345.15s]  And I'm the bad guy?
[5345.15s -> 5348.10s]  I'm the bad guy?
[5348.10s -> 5350.10s]  You don't think that that deserves
[5350.10s -> 5352.10s]  like a 20 minute fucking timeout?
[5352.10s -> 5354.10s]  Like, just relax and go over your life
[5354.10s -> 5365.17s]  for a little bit?
[5365.17s -> 5367.17s]  Alright, pieces of cram back in here. Let's see if this thing can send a message.
[5367.17s -> 5370.75s]  Hi there crew, it's me.
[5370.75s -> 5372.75s]  Your brother from another
[5372.75s -> 5374.75s]  rudder.
[5374.75s -> 5376.75s]  So, listen. It happened again. Can you swing by
[5376.75s -> 5378.75s]  to pick me up? Send me my coordinates now.
[5378.75s -> 5380.75s]  Gulliver. Over and out.
[5380.75s -> 5384.90s]  That should do it.
[5384.90s -> 5386.90s]  You're the best. Thanks for all your help. I promised to return the favor.
[5386.90s -> 5388.90s]  Make sure to check your mail in a few days.
[5388.90s -> 5390.90s]  I'm gonna send you something that'll knock your flippers up.
[5390.90s -> 5403.70s]  Look at this dude.
[5403.70s -> 5405.70s]  Fireman. Yeah.
[5405.70s -> 5408.90s]  Fireman's in a lot of games.
[5408.90s -> 5410.90s]  Nothing to do now but pace back and forth the next few hours.
[5410.90s -> 5413.97s]  I'm gonna play Doom Eternal.
[5413.97s -> 5419.58s]  I don't know, maybe.
[5419.58s -> 5421.58s]  I had a choice to play Doom
[5421.58s -> 5423.58s]  or this and I chose this.
[5423.58s -> 5434.53s]  Wait, I still have
[5434.53s -> 5438.11s]  two more Gulliver requests?
[5438.11s -> 5441.44s]  What about Resident Evil 3?
[5441.44s -> 5443.81s]  Absolutely. Without question,
[5443.81s -> 5445.81s]  I will play Resident Evil 3. Resident Evil 2 Remake was
[5445.81s -> 5447.81s]  my favorite game of last year so I will absolutely.
[5447.81s -> 5454.78s]  Alright, so I got yours.
[5454.78s -> 5456.78s]  Yours only said a few days.
[5456.78s -> 5458.78s]  I need one more
[5458.78s -> 5461.73s]  thing to donate. Which, let's see.
[5461.73s -> 5463.73s]  I don't really have very much.
[5463.73s -> 5466.93s]  Let's go sell these peaches.
[5466.93s -> 5477.94s]  Let's go sell all this crap.
[5477.94s -> 5480.37s]  What about Half-Life Alyx? I can't
[5480.37s -> 5482.74s]  do it. I can't do it right now.
[5482.74s -> 5486.13s]  Not only am I moving
[5486.13s -> 5488.13s]  I still have this
[5488.13s -> 5490.13s]  fucking chest and back problem.
[5490.13s -> 5492.13s]  I'm not gonna be able to play that at launch.
[5492.13s -> 5501.34s]  He's moving? Alright.
[5501.34s -> 5503.34s]  I forgot, like, every hour there's another, like, new
[5503.34s -> 5505.34s]  thousand people. I forget that sometimes.
[5505.34s -> 5507.34s]  Um, yes.
[5507.34s -> 5509.52s]  Yes. Uh, staying in Vegas.
[5509.52s -> 5512.85s]  Staying in Las Vegas.
[5512.85s -> 5514.85s]  Let me get the hashtag
[5514.85s -> 5516.85s]  What the fuck is he talking about? Why is he moving?
[5516.85s -> 5521.26s]  Look what they've done.
[5521.26s -> 5525.94s]  Uh, yeah, sometimes
[5525.94s -> 5527.94s]  I forget there's a lot of
[5527.94s -> 5529.94s]  If there's 5,000 people that
[5529.94s -> 5531.94s]  are here right now, that means
[5531.94s -> 5534.18s]  that 5 to 600
[5534.18s -> 5536.18s]  every 10 to 20 minutes are cycling
[5536.18s -> 5538.18s]  through. It's a very remarkable piece of data
[5538.18s -> 5542.27s]  if you ever get a chance to look at it.
[5542.27s -> 5551.94s]  Sell all this stuff. I'm gonna make some money
[5551.94s -> 5554.11s]  here, right? With clams.
[5554.11s -> 5556.11s]  Zelda. Kauris.
[5556.11s -> 5559.50s]  Very remarkable data. LOL
[5559.50s -> 5561.50s]  Who the fuck is this guy?
[5561.50s -> 5566.05s]  I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
[5566.05s -> 5570.27s]  Hey! Look at me!
[5570.27s -> 5573.66s]  Yadadadadada!
[5573.66s -> 5575.66s]  Sorry. I got a little
[5575.66s -> 5577.66s]  smart there. Let me, like, back it up a little.
[5577.66s -> 5584.51s]  Sorry. That's what I meant to say.
[5584.51s -> 5586.88s]  Sorry.
[5586.88s -> 5590.08s]  What is this one?
[5590.08s -> 5592.96s]  Got it. What is this one?
[5592.96s -> 5596.29s]  What is it saying? What is this one saying?
[5596.29s -> 5600.05s]  Got it. Got it. I can't hear it. Got it.
[5600.05s -> 5602.99s]  Got it. Got it. Got it.
[5602.99s -> 5605.74s]  Got it. Got it.
[5605.74s -> 5608.05s]  Got it. Oh, right. From
[5608.05s -> 5614.38s]  WariWare. Okay. I really
[5614.38s -> 5616.38s]  should. Oh, this is, I'm so
[5616.38s -> 5618.94s]  happy I have this recorded. Because
[5618.94s -> 5621.50s]  randomly, I'm just gonna play that.
[5621.50s -> 5623.68s]  And people are gonna think it was a real sneeze. And I'm not gonna
[5623.68s -> 5625.68s]  be funny or anything. I'm just gonna be
[5625.68s -> 5627.68s]  sitting there going, like, I'll make noise beforehand too.
[5627.68s -> 5630.82s]  I'll be like, and done! I can buy these
[5630.82s -> 5632.99s]  from you for a total of
[5632.99s -> 5635.74s]  seven thousand...
[5635.74s -> 5638.80s]  God! Sorry. And then just keep
[5638.80s -> 5642.38s]  going with my deck.
[5642.38s -> 5644.38s]  I'm gonna do that all the fucking time. Prepare.
[5644.38s -> 5647.65s]  And done. I can buy these from you. Seven
[5647.65s -> 5651.23s]  thousand bells is a lot. It sounds so
[5651.23s -> 5654.24s]  real. It was real. It was real.
[5654.24s -> 5657.06s]  Two, three in a row.
[5657.06s -> 5665.04s]  Okay. Here we go. Ready? I want
[5665.04s -> 5667.79s]  you guys to start writing. Like, what the fuck
[5667.79s -> 5670.22s]  is wrong with them? Like, that's too many in a row.
[5670.22s -> 5672.22s]  Like, dude, do you have allergies? Like, start writing
[5672.22s -> 5682.11s]  that. Hold on. Ready?
[5682.11s -> 5686.00s]  Ugh. God.
[5686.00s -> 5688.93s]  Ugh. No, no, no.
[5688.93s -> 5693.01s]  Another one.
[5693.01s -> 5698.43s]  Fuck. How many is that in a row? Ah, my nose
[5698.43s -> 5700.43s]  is so tingly. It sucks.
[5700.43s -> 5703.42s]  You know when you get...
[5703.42s -> 5707.44s]  Geez. Oh, I think
[5707.44s -> 5709.44s]  the room is kind of
[5709.44s -> 5711.87s]  dusty.
[5711.87s -> 5714.05s]  The room is so fucking dusty.
[5714.05s -> 5717.82s]  I'm sorry. I shouldn't have opened up the
[5717.82s -> 5720.00s]  bag of flour in here. That was a mistake.
[5727.52s -> 5729.52s]  What happens if you sneeze?
[5729.52s -> 5731.52s]  Does anybody know what happens?
[5731.52s -> 5733.52s]  Does anybody know what happens if you sneeze
[5733.52s -> 5735.52s]  like ten times in a row?
[5735.52s -> 5737.76s]  What happens if you sneeze like ten times
[5737.76s -> 5740.45s]  in a row?
[5747.36s -> 5749.36s]  Twenty.
[5753.36s -> 5755.92s]  Ugh.
[5755.92s -> 5757.92s]  Ugh.
[5757.92s -> 5759.92s]  Fuck.
[5759.92s -> 5762.16s]  Oh, no. Is that better anymore?
[5762.16s -> 5764.16s]  Ugh.
[5764.16s -> 5767.49s]  This is the most time I've sneezed in my
[5767.49s -> 5769.49s]  entire life.
[5769.49s -> 5774.59s]  Ugh. Okay. I think
[5774.59s -> 5778.11s]  they're gone. I think they're gone. I think that's it.
[5778.11s -> 5784.56s]  I don't think there are any more in here.
[5784.56s -> 5788.46s]  Jesus. Okay.
[5788.46s -> 5791.41s]  So, what I was saying was
[5791.41s -> 5793.41s]  I saw the Star Wars movie and it
[5793.41s -> 5795.65s]  was fucking... I mean, it was okay.
[5795.65s -> 5798.13s]  If you...
[5798.13s -> 5800.13s]  Ugh.
[5800.13s -> 5802.13s]  Ugh.
[5802.13s -> 5804.13s]  Ugh.
[5804.13s -> 5811.23s]  Fuck.
[5811.23s -> 5816.29s]  I'm okay now, I think.
[5816.29s -> 5821.79s]  Star Wars movie. Very topical.
[5821.79s -> 5823.79s]  You lost 150 viewers. It's alright.
[5823.79s -> 5826.48s]  I'll be back tomorrow.
[5826.48s -> 5838.26s]  I'm a fucking psycho. I gotta relax.
[5838.26s -> 5842.22s]  Okay. What's next?
[5842.22s -> 5844.59s]  Am I out of stuff to do?
[5844.59s -> 5846.59s]  Oh, wait a minute.
[5846.59s -> 5848.59s]  I need one more fossil. One more.
[5848.59s -> 5854.67s]  Fish. And then the airport. Yeah.
[5854.67s -> 5856.91s]  Let me get this last fish
[5856.91s -> 5858.91s]  and then we can figure that out.
[5858.91s -> 5860.91s]  Where's my fishing rod? God, this game is
[5860.91s -> 5864.82s]  so good.
[5864.82s -> 5867.25s]  Alright, I took it off.
[5867.25s -> 5869.25s]  Can I... How do I put it on my thing?
[5869.25s -> 5873.66s]  Register.
[5873.66s -> 5884.67s]  That just sneezes were real?
[5884.67s -> 5888.13s]  Well, that's not worth anything.
[5888.13s -> 5890.13s]  Put a...
[5890.13s -> 5892.13s]  That old tire could be repurposed. I've got an idea for a DIY
[5892.13s -> 5894.13s]  project?
[5894.13s -> 5898.85s]  Wait. That's kind of cool.
[5898.85s -> 5911.07s]  Really? Be a fish I haven't seen.
[5911.07s -> 5917.09s]  No, I've already seen this.
[5917.09s -> 5935.58s]  I probably need to go this way
[5935.58s -> 5937.58s]  and go to the river.
[5937.58s -> 5942.83s]  I want a rare fish.
[5942.83s -> 5944.83s]  It's weird. He does that sometimes
[5944.83s -> 5946.83s]  when I'm watching the streams.
[5946.83s -> 5948.83s]  He does that fake Boston accent, almost like
[5948.83s -> 5950.83s]  he's pretending that he's from the area that he's
[5950.83s -> 5953.26s]  actually from.
[5953.26s -> 5955.26s]  Does anybody know why he's doing that?
[5955.26s -> 5979.38s]  Enter. Question mark.
[5979.38s -> 5981.38s]  Ooh, it's a flounder. I caught a dab.
[5981.38s -> 5985.09s]  Not bad. Name of the fish.
[5985.09s -> 5990.85s]  Well, there's the last thing to give to the
[5990.85s -> 5994.43s]  museum.
[5994.43s -> 5998.91s]  Looking for bugs? Okay, no bugs?
[5998.91s -> 6001.73s]  Alright, let's do the museum.
[6001.73s -> 6003.73s]  And then I'm going to do the airline ticket thing.
[6003.73s -> 6008.53s]  Actually, it's called a nose wipe.
[6008.53s -> 6010.53s]  Yeah, sorry. I misspoke.
[6010.53s -> 6025.95s]  Wait, did I do this one? Yeah, I did.
[6025.95s -> 6028.77s]  It's a pretty fucking cool looking house.
[6028.77s -> 6038.11s]  I wonder who's that is.
[6038.11s -> 6040.11s]  I don't know if you're nominating this for the worst joke
[6040.11s -> 6042.11s]  taking more than five minutes.
[6042.11s -> 6045.06s]  I see the title a little that way.
[6045.06s -> 6047.06s]  You don't think I can see what clips are being made?
[6047.06s -> 6051.28s]  I can see it over there.
[6051.28s -> 6061.18s]  Assess this.
[6061.18s -> 6063.42s]  Wait, I don't have any policies, do I?
[6063.42s -> 6066.11s]  I'd like to make a donation.
[6066.11s -> 6068.42s]  I'd like to make a donation.
[6068.42s -> 6070.42s]  And then the museum can
[6070.42s -> 6073.74s]  open.
[6073.74s -> 6077.26s]  Probably tomorrow.
[6077.26s -> 6079.26s]  This is a dab.
[6079.26s -> 6083.68s]  Actually, let's get some facts.
[6083.68s -> 6085.68s]  The dab is a flatfish that bears some
[6085.68s -> 6087.68s]  resemblance to the olive flounder.
[6087.68s -> 6089.68s]  The olive flarden.
[6089.68s -> 6091.68s]  Though their mouths are different.
[6091.68s -> 6093.68s]  Personally, I'm more really fascinated by each
[6093.68s -> 6095.68s]  fish's eye placement.
[6095.68s -> 6097.68s]  The dab's eyes are both on its right side,
[6097.68s -> 6099.68s]  while the olive flounder's are on the left.
[6099.68s -> 6102.56s]  These fish spend
[6102.56s -> 6104.56s]  lots of time lying on their sides in the sands.
[6104.56s -> 6106.56s]  The odd eye placement makes some sense.
[6106.56s -> 6108.56s]  But it's not going to be this creepy.
[6108.56s -> 6110.56s]  Incredibly disturbing.
[6110.56s -> 6112.56s]  Profoundly upsetting to fans.
[6112.56s -> 6114.56s]  And there you have it.
[6114.56s -> 6116.56s]  Grasping stuff. Bravo.
[6116.56s -> 6118.56s]  Once the museum is complete, it should be displayed
[6118.56s -> 6122.78s]  with the utmost dignity. I do believe this
[6122.78s -> 6124.78s]  means, yes, we have acquired the number as
[6124.78s -> 6126.78s]  specimens required. I'm fed as I am a loss
[6126.78s -> 6128.78s]  for words. Never would I have imagined
[6128.78s -> 6130.78s]  we could reach our donation goal
[6130.78s -> 6132.78s]  on this, my very first day on the island.
[6132.78s -> 6134.78s]  The generosity that made this possible,
[6134.78s -> 6136.78s]  the passion I am humbled by, the spirit
[6136.78s -> 6138.78s]  of Salt-Bressed
[6138.78s -> 6141.09s]  Mountain.
[6141.09s -> 6143.09s]  Now we can submit our application to build a proper museum.
[6143.09s -> 6145.09s]  Oh, I'm, I'm, I must
[6145.09s -> 6147.09s]  make haste. I gotta prepare all this shit,
[6147.09s -> 6149.09s]  dude. I gotta, there's an opening that I gotta
[6149.09s -> 6151.09s]  be ready to open tomorrow. There's so much to do. Let's go.
[6151.09s -> 6157.74s]  Thank you so much, Jeremy.
[6157.74s -> 6166.05s]  All right. Done. Done.
[6166.05s -> 6168.22s]  Both tasks completed.
[6168.22s -> 6170.66s]  In record time.
[6170.66s -> 6172.66s]  Now we go to the airport.
[6172.66s -> 6177.46s]  Holy shit, he's chasing me!
[6177.46s -> 6179.89s]  Oh, oh!
[6179.89s -> 6182.06s]  What do I do? How do I? Okay, I'm gonna turn around.
[6182.06s -> 6184.06s]  Phoebe, do something! Phoebe!
[6184.06s -> 6190.08s]  Phoebe, do you have any? Get the fuck out of
[6190.08s -> 6192.08s]  here. That was bait the whole time. I had
[6192.08s -> 6196.56s]  confidence the entire time. Now I'm gonna
[6196.56s -> 6199.38s]  sell this little fuck.
[6199.38s -> 6208.02s]  It's mean. Wait, can I just have,
[6208.02s -> 6220.43s]  what if I just keep it in my house?
[6220.43s -> 6226.13s]  I have a pet spider now. Can I play?
[6226.13s -> 6228.13s]  Oh my god, it's a friend. It's a friend.
[6228.13s -> 6230.13s]  His friend showed up.
[6230.13s -> 6233.78s]  Oh my god, I'm so scared. Oh my god.
[6233.78s -> 6235.78s]  Oh my god, what do I do? What do I?
[6235.78s -> 6241.86s]  Fuck, I was trying to go for a two.
[6241.86s -> 6247.23s]  It didn't work twice. It's okay.
[6247.23s -> 6256.56s]  But, here
[6256.56s -> 6259.18s]  we go. So, Mirantula,
[6259.18s -> 6263.07s]  show it off. Ah!
[6263.07s -> 6267.60s]  Place. There's no, wait, what do you mean
[6267.60s -> 6269.60s]  there's no room? I can't put it on the table?
[6269.60s -> 6274.53s]  Yes!
[6274.53s -> 6283.79s]  Wow! It's just you
[6283.79s -> 6292.18s]  and me. This is so cool.
[6292.18s -> 6300.48s]  Right, here. Okay.
[6300.48s -> 6302.66s]  Come on. What do you want to watch?
[6302.66s -> 6311.30s]  Oh, you can watch it on Switch, whatever you want.
[6311.30s -> 6321.34s]  Put on anything. Small.
[6321.34s -> 6323.34s]  He's gonna binge Rocket Power.
[6323.34s -> 6325.78s]  I come back in
[6325.78s -> 6330.24s]  and watch history is like
[6330.24s -> 6332.24s]  every single fucking season,
[6332.24s -> 6334.24s]  every single episode of like
[6334.24s -> 6337.38s]  Doctor Who has just been watched.
[6337.38s -> 6340.00s]  Of all like
[6340.00s -> 6349.41s]  20 years of the series. Okay.
[6349.41s -> 6351.41s]  So now, go just, do I just go to the airport?
[6351.41s -> 6357.42s]  What a mediocre show.
[6357.42s -> 6359.42s]  I'm, I think
[6359.42s -> 6361.42s]  what you just said right there.
[6361.42s -> 6363.42s]  I'm 99% certain that
[6363.42s -> 6365.42s]  somebody's going to scream in your face because you said that.
[6365.42s -> 6369.58s]  You know what I'm saying? Like I would
[6369.58s -> 6371.58s]  someone's probably gonna scream at you.
[6371.58s -> 6374.78s]  Where am I going? Where's the
[6374.78s -> 6376.78s]  airport? Down here.
[6376.78s -> 6388.62s]  So what can I do? I can go to a mystery
[6388.62s -> 6394.64s]  island? Doctor Who bad.
[6394.64s -> 6400.08s]  Doctor Who bad. Hey, welcome
[6400.08s -> 6402.08s]  to your one and only gateway to the skies.
[6402.08s -> 6404.08s]  Soft Crest Airport. Nice to meet you.
[6404.08s -> 6406.08s]  I'm Orville, ground crew for Dodo Airlines.
[6406.08s -> 6408.08s]  Dodo Airlines, the crew may be flightless.
[6408.08s -> 6410.38s]  That doesn't mean you have to be.
[6410.38s -> 6412.38s]  If you want to visit another island, invite friends
[6412.38s -> 6414.38s]  this one. Or go on a mystery tour, this is the place
[6414.38s -> 6416.38s]  to be. Oh, we've also got a mail
[6416.38s -> 6418.38s]  service at this airport. Sometimes a letter
[6418.38s -> 6420.38s]  is just better, you know?
[6420.38s -> 6422.38s]  If you want to send somebody a note, take a gander
[6422.38s -> 6424.62s]  to your right. Got all kinds of cards
[6424.62s -> 6427.38s]  at the card stand. By the way,
[6427.38s -> 6430.06s]  you're Jeremy, right?
[6430.06s -> 6432.06s]  It's a small island. Word gets around.
[6432.06s -> 6434.50s]  I just got a Nook Miles ticket
[6434.50s -> 6436.50s]  from Tom Nook with Jeremy written
[6436.50s -> 6438.50s]  on it, which makes it yours.
[6438.50s -> 6440.50s]  So if you want to use this ticket,
[6440.50s -> 6442.50s]  you just got to say the magic words.
[6442.50s -> 6446.53s]  I want to fly. Got it? So,
[6446.53s -> 6448.53s]  Jeremy, you got anything
[6448.53s -> 6451.66s]  to tell me? Thank you, Guy on
[6451.66s -> 6453.66s]  Fiverr for your voice acting that I paid
[6453.66s -> 6455.66s]  for. It was like $14.
[6455.66s -> 6458.61s]  Appreciate it. I want visitors.
[6458.61s -> 6460.61s]  I want to fly. Wait,
[6460.61s -> 6462.61s]  I want to send some cards
[6462.61s -> 6467.20s]  in the mail.
[6467.20s -> 6469.20s]  They have a card stand here. Looks like I can send a
[6469.20s -> 6472.53s]  message on a card with 200 bells.
[6472.53s -> 6476.99s]  Send a letter? Sure.
[6476.99s -> 6478.99s]  I want to go to Mystery Island.
[6478.99s -> 6480.99s]  I'm not letting chat join this.
[6480.99s -> 6482.99s]  I will ruin my whole game.
[6482.99s -> 6488.29s]  I want to fly. People are going to come
[6488.29s -> 6490.46s]  out here and just start throwing grass on
[6490.46s -> 6492.46s]  the ground. They're going to do like the Dark Souls
[6492.46s -> 6494.46s]  thing, where they just drop fucking humanity
[6494.46s -> 6503.81s]  everywhere until your game crashes. I want
[6503.81s -> 6505.98s]  to visit someone. I want...what should I do?
[6505.98s -> 6507.98s]  Do I use the Nook Miles ticket?
[6507.98s -> 6512.34s]  You want to use your Nook Miles ticket?
[6512.34s -> 6515.09s]  Roger. In that case, I'll just take this ticket
[6515.09s -> 6517.46s]  I got from Tom Nook.
[6517.46s -> 6519.46s]  Ready to get you in the sky right this minute, but let's just check.
[6519.46s -> 6523.49s]  Are you all packed? Tools already?
[6523.49s -> 6525.66s]  Wait, not yet.
[6525.66s -> 6527.66s]  Do I have any...wait, actually, I'm good.
[6530.53s -> 6533.92s]  Okay, hold on. Okay, I got a lot of crap in my inventory.
[6533.92s -> 6540.70s]  Hold on. I'll visit somebody from chat.
[6540.70s -> 6545.12s]  No, I don't want anyone to...I don't want to
[6545.12s -> 6547.12s]  visit somebody from chat. They can like reverse fucking
[6547.12s -> 6549.12s]  Google Image search my game and find my game.
[6549.12s -> 6560.37s]  I'm not doing...no. True.
[6560.37s -> 6562.37s]  He knows.
[6562.37s -> 6564.37s]  He's paranoid.
[6564.37s -> 6569.94s]  Hey, what are you watching? He's fucking
[6569.94s -> 6571.94s]  scary. I would never be able
[6571.94s -> 6573.94s]  to have a Tarantula for a pet, never, in a
[6573.94s -> 6584.30s]  million years. They're just scary.
[6584.30s -> 6587.04s]  I'll be honest.
[6587.04s -> 6589.04s]  I know they're not, and I know that's me just
[6589.04s -> 6591.34s]  being...that's bullshit.
[6591.34s -> 6593.90s]  I know, but they're scary.
[6593.90s -> 6595.90s]  They're terrifying to me. They
[6595.90s -> 6616.26s]  terrify the fuck out of me. Alright, what do I
[6616.26s -> 6619.46s]  need to bring? I need
[6619.46s -> 6622.27s]  I don't need the watering can. Shovel, net,
[6622.27s -> 6624.58s]  pole vault, slingshot,
[6624.58s -> 6628.74s]  I don't need the umbrella. Axe?
[6628.74s -> 6634.18s]  I need a fishing rod. Yeah. Alright.
[6634.18s -> 6642.54s]  Go visit italics? People say visit
[6642.54s -> 6650.61s]  Vinnie? Where did my rod go?
[6650.61s -> 6659.44s]  But they like playing their games.
[6659.44s -> 6664.56s]  I'm not going to go invade anybody.
[6664.56s -> 6670.77s]  I don't want to be like a fucking Dark Souls
[6670.77s -> 6679.79s]  invader. Another Dark Souls
[6679.79s -> 6686.38s]  reference. There it is. Didn't Vinnie say
[6686.38s -> 6688.38s]  multiple times he didn't want to do online?
[6688.38s -> 6690.38s]  Yeah, that's what I'm saying. It's not like
[6690.38s -> 6693.50s]  Okay, listen.
[6693.50s -> 6695.68s]  If a bunch of...
[6695.68s -> 6697.68s]  Let's say somebody was in their house
[6697.68s -> 6699.68s]  just sitting down like on their bed
[6699.68s -> 6701.86s]  and hanging out with some people. And then
[6701.86s -> 6703.86s]  there's like a whole group of people in another house
[6703.86s -> 6705.86s]  that want one person to
[6705.86s -> 6707.86s]  go over to that other person's house.
[6707.86s -> 6710.86s]  Dude, go to that person's house. Go
[6710.86s -> 6713.23s]  check out that person's house.
[6713.23s -> 6715.23s]  Alright, I'm going. And I'm like, I go over there and I fucking
[6715.23s -> 6717.23s]  start climbing up the window and knock on the window.
[6717.23s -> 6719.23s]  Hey, man. Hey, can I come in your
[6719.23s -> 6721.60s]  house? It's like, dude, I don't want anybody
[6721.60s -> 6723.60s]  over here right now. I know, but that's me.
[6723.60s -> 6725.60s]  That's me, man. I'm coming over, right?
[6725.60s -> 6728.93s]  No, I don't want
[6728.93s -> 6730.93s]  anybody over. Hey, okay, just come in.
[6730.93s -> 6732.93s]  Yeah, that's right. I'm on the window.
[6732.93s -> 6734.93s]  And I fucking slide in. What are we doing?
[6734.93s -> 6736.93s]  What are we doing? Can I drink these beers?
[6736.93s -> 6739.94s]  Thanks, man.
[6739.94s -> 6741.94s]  Oh, that's a good one. You got any food?
[6741.94s -> 6744.94s]  I don't know what to say.
[6744.94s -> 6746.94s]  If we want to do it, then
[6746.94s -> 6750.66s]  we'll do it. We'll set it up.
[6750.66s -> 6753.22s]  Sorry.
[6753.22s -> 6755.22s]  Oh, sorry.
[6755.22s -> 6757.22s]  Well, what? Are you going to get mad at me?
[6757.22s -> 6759.22s]  I see your face right there. You're looking at me with a mad face.
[6759.22s -> 6761.22s]  You've got a buffet-style fucking
[6761.22s -> 6764.29s]  party here. What do you want me to do?
[6764.29s -> 6773.38s]  You don't have a sneeze guard.
[6773.38s -> 6780.80s]  I visited my
[6780.80s -> 6782.80s]  drunken gerba at 3 a.m.
[6785.94s -> 6792.85s]  Oh, that's so stupid.
[6792.85s -> 6794.85s]  That's unfucking believable. All right.
[6794.85s -> 6797.41s]  Put the fire out. No!
[6797.41s -> 6799.41s]  No! No!
[6799.41s -> 6801.41s]  YouTube! Whoa!
[6801.41s -> 6811.26s]  Now it's not even scented.
[6811.26s -> 6813.89s]  All right. I'm going to the mystery
[6813.89s -> 6817.28s]  island. I got my tools.
[6817.28s -> 6819.28s]  Wait, no, I don't. I need a fishing
[6819.28s -> 6821.71s]  rod. Build it.
[6821.71s -> 6823.71s]  I did that joke yesterday. I'm not going to do
[6823.71s -> 6825.71s]  it again. I know. I mean, we're going to repeat
[6825.71s -> 6827.71s]  the same thing we just did. I'm
[6827.71s -> 6829.71s]  going to go the I am to set it. And then I'm going to
[6829.71s -> 6831.71s]  do the re thing.
[6831.71s -> 6833.71s]  But he spins. We already did that yesterday.
[6833.71s -> 6843.82s]  It's been less than 24 hours since I did that.
[6843.82s -> 6845.82s]  Remember, we just saw a frame of nudity.
[6845.82s -> 6849.34s]  So what is this?
[6849.34s -> 6851.90s]  Tire toy? Oh, cool.
[6851.90s -> 6855.10s]  All right. What does a fishing rod take?
[6855.10s -> 6857.54s]  Three branches.
[6857.54s -> 6871.30s]  Shake, shake, shake, shake.
[6871.30s -> 6874.10s]  What is that? Shake, shake, shake,
[6874.10s -> 6876.46s]  shake, shake, shake.
[6876.46s -> 6878.46s]  That's from Mystic Makers for the Nintendo 64.
[6878.46s -> 6880.46s]  I'll be playing that at some point.
[6880.46s -> 6896.02s]  Just farm tarantulas.
[6896.02s -> 6898.58s]  Just have a house of tarantulas.
[6898.58s -> 6904.78s]  Can I just have like every
[6904.78s -> 6906.78s]  tile in my house be tarantulas?
[6906.78s -> 6914.78s]  Just ride the rides in the amusement
[6914.78s -> 6919.65s]  park level. Go to the new island
[6919.65s -> 6921.65s]  already. I got to have a fishing rod, man.
[6921.65s -> 6924.08s]  And you're going to throw it in all caps
[6924.08s -> 6943.34s]  to me? A little annoyed by this.
[6943.34s -> 6946.54s]  OK, so we got, we just need
[6946.54s -> 6948.54s]  to get rid of these. Sell the twigs.
[6948.54s -> 6950.54s]  Who cares? Who even cares?
[6950.54s -> 6954.06s]  Sell. Fuck you,
[6954.06s -> 6956.06s]  Jerema. You rock. Kind of a weird
[6956.06s -> 6958.24s]  statement to make back to back
[6958.24s -> 6964.64s]  there. No, I want to sell.
[6964.64s -> 6967.14s]  Not B-A. Oh, fuck it.
[6967.14s -> 6969.14s]  I just dropped on the ground. I'm going to go on the plane
[6969.14s -> 6975.22s]  now. Good job, Jerema.
[6975.22s -> 6977.97s]  Nice one, dude. I'm sitting in my
[6977.97s -> 6979.97s]  chair right now leaning back.
[6979.97s -> 6990.45s]  Nice one, dude.
[6990.45s -> 6993.14s]  B'day. Fuck this guy. Fuck this
[6993.14s -> 6995.14s]  guy. Fuck this guy. Fuck this guy. Fuck this guy.
[6995.14s -> 6997.14s]  God, he sucks.
[7014.48s -> 7038.27s]  Who would have guessed that he would use that clip?
[7038.27s -> 7040.27s]  You may think I might be overdoing it, but do you
[7040.27s -> 7042.27s]  and if you haven't been here for a while, you might not know.
[7042.27s -> 7044.27s]  I've been waiting so long to get
[7044.27s -> 7046.27s]  that real sneeze recorded on
[7046.27s -> 7048.27s]  this stupid fucking thing. It's been
[7048.27s -> 7050.51s]  at least four or five months.
[7050.51s -> 7053.14s]  I'm sorry. I'm going to use
[7053.14s -> 7055.14s]  it. I've been waiting. I got my new toy.
[7055.14s -> 7057.14s]  I'm going to use it. Sorry.
[7057.14s -> 7059.14s]  It's the way it is. It's just the way it is.
[7059.14s -> 7062.78s]  Saltcrest
[7062.78s -> 7064.78s]  airport.
[7064.78s -> 7067.92s]  I want to fly.
[7067.92s -> 7074.56s]  Let's go to
[7074.56s -> 7077.12s]  Mystery Island.
[7077.12s -> 7080.38s]  Loop the sneeze for three hours.
[7080.38s -> 7082.38s]  People would leave. They really would.
[7082.38s -> 7084.38s]  I mean, we make jokes, but people would actually be like,
[7084.38s -> 7086.38s]  I'm never coming back again.
[7086.38s -> 7091.04s]  Time for takeoff.
[7091.04s -> 7093.04s]  Did you delete almond or Wi-Fi? Yes, I did.
[7093.04s -> 7100.91s]  Dodo one. This is Dodo tower.
[7100.91s -> 7102.91s]  Wilbert. You copy? Got a walker
[7102.91s -> 7105.41s]  who needs wings. Roger.
[7105.41s -> 7107.41s]  Roger.
[7107.41s -> 7109.41s]  There you go.
[7109.41s -> 7111.41s]  How much time do I have on here?
[7111.41s -> 7113.41s]  Is this a limited amount of time here?
[7121.86s -> 7123.86s]  We're two down and docked at the
[7123.86s -> 7125.86s]  target. First time getting
[7125.86s -> 7127.86s]  your pontoons wet on
[7127.86s -> 7129.86s]  floor. Let me brief you on the Mystery Island.
[7129.86s -> 7131.86s]  First, we run the finder's keepers
[7131.86s -> 7133.86s]  protocol here. Lumber, root,
[7133.86s -> 7135.86s]  fish, whatever. Yours if you can carry it.
[7135.86s -> 7137.86s]  Next up, break a tool. Forget one.
[7137.86s -> 7139.86s]  I can requisition or you will replacement.
[7139.86s -> 7141.86s]  Got to charge you miles though.
[7141.86s -> 7143.86s]  There's one red line item you need
[7143.86s -> 7145.86s]  to memorize like your favorite leotard order.
[7145.86s -> 7147.86s]  Anything you leave behind stays here. We don't
[7147.86s -> 7149.86s]  come back to these places.
[7151.86s -> 7153.86s]  Actually burn the flight plans afterwards. Security
[7153.86s -> 7155.86s]  reasons. Can't explain that.
[7155.86s -> 7157.86s]  Kylo Ren.
[7168.02s -> 7171.86s]  No.
[7171.86s -> 7174.80s]  Go catch some bees.
[7174.80s -> 7176.80s]  Oh, wow. Holy shit. Look at these flowers.
[7176.80s -> 7179.74s]  What? What?
[7179.74s -> 7185.42s]  I can just take them?
[7185.42s -> 7187.42s]  Why can I just take everything?
[7187.42s -> 7197.28s]  Holy shit. It's all free.
[7197.28s -> 7214.43s]  Let me get this right.
[7214.43s -> 7245.20s]  Okay, that's good. Use the shovel on
[7245.20s -> 7253.90s]  the flowers. What's the difference?
[7253.90s -> 7258.38s]  Oh, it's like the actual plant.
[7258.38s -> 7264.85s]  Use the shovel. I know
[7264.85s -> 7266.85s]  I see the cow. I'm trying not to get that
[7266.85s -> 7269.34s]  excited about it. Trying to stay
[7269.34s -> 7277.98s]  grounded.
[7277.98s -> 7286.37s]  I just take them all? No, I don't want this
[7286.37s -> 7290.98s]  theft. Well, is it theft if
[7290.98s -> 7292.98s]  they just told? The guy just told me on the dock.
[7292.98s -> 7294.98s]  Take everything you can carry.
[7294.98s -> 7296.98s]  I see a stink bug.
[7296.98s -> 7300.24s]  I missed it and I'm bucking
[7300.24s -> 7303.63s]  furious. How could I
[7303.63s -> 7305.63s]  be so stupid? How could I
[7305.63s -> 7307.63s]  mess that up?
[7307.63s -> 7313.90s]  I can sell this stuff, can't I?
[7313.90s -> 7329.63s]  Sneeze alert. What do you mean
[7329.63s -> 7331.94s]  sneeze alert? Wait, okay,
[7331.94s -> 7333.94s]  hold on. So you're talking about I just need to do
[7333.94s -> 7335.94s]  this.
[7335.94s -> 7337.94s]  Like that? Is this gonna work?
[7337.94s -> 7359.36s]  Cool. Very cool.
[7359.36s -> 7369.79s]  He gets it. He gets it. He gets it. I do know.
[7369.79s -> 7372.22s]  Are those coconuts?
[7372.22s -> 7374.78s]  Fresh coconuts.
[7374.78s -> 7376.78s]  Can I plant a coconut tree?
[7376.78s -> 7380.80s]  I hope so.
[7380.80s -> 7382.80s]  No, those are dumb. I don't want those.
[7382.80s -> 7388.18s]  Actually, I'm running out
[7388.18s -> 7390.48s]  of space.
[7390.48s -> 7392.48s]  They don't stack.
[7392.48s -> 7396.13s]  These don't stack. Do they?
[7396.13s -> 7407.26s]  No, bury it.
[7407.26s -> 7413.66s]  Oh, shit. Okay.
[7413.66s -> 7426.06s]  Let's talk to Muriel.
[7426.06s -> 7428.06s]  Great to meet you. How are you?
[7428.06s -> 7430.06s]  I'm Patty. Welcome to my
[7430.06s -> 7432.06s]  Hype-tastic island getaway.
[7432.06s -> 7434.06s]  It's not my island, but it will be.
[7434.06s -> 7436.06s]  I want to be a pop star in all pop stars
[7436.06s -> 7438.06s]  on island.
[7438.06s -> 7440.06s]  To your Germans who salt-crest fab, I love meeting new
[7440.06s -> 7442.06s]  folks, aka new fans.
[7442.06s -> 7445.89s]  Nothing better than
[7445.89s -> 7447.89s]  kicking back and chilling on an island would be
[7447.89s -> 7449.89s]  to do it forever.
[7449.89s -> 7451.89s]  Spending time on an island is the best way to find your inner calm
[7451.89s -> 7453.89s]  and hug it as hard as you
[7453.89s -> 7455.89s]  can. If I lived on an island,
[7455.89s -> 7457.89s]  how now? I'd be the
[7457.89s -> 7459.89s]  calmest, most relaxed, cow-pop star I've ever met.
[7459.89s -> 7462.45s]  Do you want to live on
[7462.45s -> 7464.82s]  my
[7464.82s -> 7467.82s]  island?
[7467.82s -> 7469.82s]  Move to Saltcrest? Oh my
[7469.82s -> 7471.82s]  gosh, yes.
[7471.82s -> 7473.82s]  I could move to any old island, but this is way better
[7473.82s -> 7476.51s]  since you'll be there.
[7476.51s -> 7478.51s]  You hear that, world? I'm moving
[7478.51s -> 7482.16s]  to Saltcrest.
[7482.16s -> 7484.16s]  Yay.
[7484.16s -> 7486.16s]  That's sarcastic.
[7486.16s -> 7488.16s]  Oh my gosh, moving. Hey, guys, so stressful. So much to do.
[7488.16s -> 7490.16s]  Gotta calm down. Center yourself,
[7490.16s -> 7492.16s]  hug it. Find your
[7492.16s -> 7494.16s]  happy place. Calm down.
[7494.16s -> 7496.16s]  How better? So all I gotta do is
[7496.16s -> 7498.16s]  get this train going and just talk to Tom Nook.
[7498.16s -> 7500.16s]  Easy. I cannot
[7500.16s -> 7502.16s]  wait to have a cheek
[7502.16s -> 7504.16s]  Saltcrest zip code.
[7504.16s -> 7506.66s]  Welcome.
[7506.66s -> 7510.80s]  See you when you get there.
[7510.80s -> 7522.50s]  Ooh, there's another rock. I see a
[7522.50s -> 7525.06s]  rock. Uh-oh.
[7525.06s -> 7527.06s]  Okay. Drop this? I gotta replant some
[7527.06s -> 7529.06s]  shit. So let me...
[7529.06s -> 7531.06s]  Okay, we're gonna do
[7531.06s -> 7550.88s]  one of each. Plant.
[7550.88s -> 7554.27s]  And then, plant, no.
[7554.27s -> 7566.29s]  Plant.
[7566.29s -> 7568.29s]  I have so many yellow ones.
[7568.29s -> 7572.58s]  Plant this, too.
[7572.58s -> 7575.95s]  I get it.
[7575.95s -> 7577.95s]  Stupid. What do you mean stupid?
[7577.95s -> 7581.54s]  Don't plant next to rock.
[7581.54s -> 7584.03s]  Why? What's going on?
[7584.03s -> 7586.03s]  Just eat the peaches.
[7586.03s -> 7588.78s]  You don't have to dig.
[7588.78s -> 7608.54s]  I don't have to dig.
[7608.54s -> 7610.54s]  Oh, I see what you're saying. I get it now.
[7610.54s -> 7612.54s]  Now I understand.
[7612.54s -> 7615.42s]  Oh, fuck it, it's already ruined, I'm curious.
[7615.42s -> 7616.78s]  Anything's already broken in front of me.
[7616.78s -> 7617.62s]  What am I gonna do?
[7617.62s -> 7624.45s]  I don't know, it's over.
[7624.45s -> 7632.22s]  Well, coconut's giving me 2,000 nook miles wasted.
[7632.22s -> 7633.86s]  No, it's not, it's not.
[7633.86s -> 7635.90s]  It's my first time on Nook Island.
[7636.86s -> 7648.88s]  It's okay, I accidentally brought home too many plants.
[7648.88s -> 7651.63s]  And I, I wasn't even looking.
[7651.63s -> 7668.88s]  Can I dig up the tree?
[7668.88s -> 7676.35s]  Do I take a coconut tree with me?
[7676.35s -> 7677.71s]  Zero out of 10.
[7677.71s -> 7680.81s]  Okay, now I can, can I, do I take this with me?
[7683.46s -> 7687.35s]  Oh my God.
[7687.35s -> 7690.58s]  Let's get a, let's take all of them.
[7690.58s -> 7699.58s]  Eat another one.
[7699.58s -> 7701.06s]  Fruits are steroids.
[7701.06s -> 7702.82s]  Wait, why is it one out of 10?
[7702.82s -> 7704.02s]  What happens if I eat 10?
[7713.60s -> 7718.27s]  10, you'll die.
[7718.27s -> 7719.11s]  That's bad.
[7720.35s -> 7726.41s]  I'll take, I'll take like three of them.
[7726.41s -> 7727.25s]  It's a charge.
[7727.25s -> 7728.41s]  Oh, okay.
[7732.96s -> 7741.94s]  These have to be planted on the beach?
[7741.94s -> 7744.02s]  Yeah, well, oh wait, what about my problem
[7744.02s -> 7751.31s]  with having beach real estate?
[7751.31s -> 7753.51s]  Fuck are you all, you, they're following me around.
[7753.51s -> 7754.35s]  I swear to God.
[7755.58s -> 7758.18s]  They're following me everywhere.
[7758.18s -> 7769.97s]  They just, they're everywhere.
[7769.97s -> 7774.72s]  Got you.
[7774.72s -> 7777.22s]  Yeah, swap it.
[7777.22s -> 7783.72s]  Swap it with these two stones, who cares?
[7783.72s -> 7789.86s]  Okay, anything else that I can do?
[7789.86s -> 7796.82s]  I got a lot of stuff.
[7796.82s -> 7804.29s]  Peaches are not stacked.
[7804.29s -> 7807.26s]  Eat the tarantula.
[7807.26s -> 7815.21s]  I'm not gonna eat the tarantula.
[7815.21s -> 7822.04s]  Shake the pine tree.
[7822.04s -> 7822.88s]  Oh, nothing.
[7841.06s -> 7842.14s]  Come on.
[7842.14s -> 7852.92s]  Come on, fish.
[7852.92s -> 7854.80s]  How do you keep getting tarantulas?
[7857.66s -> 7864.39s]  I don't know, just check my seed.
[7864.39s -> 7866.61s]  Oh, worthless.
[7868.78s -> 7869.62s]  Throw it back in.
[7889.43s -> 7890.51s]  I caught a boot.
[7891.96s -> 7894.92s]  Swap it, can I turn this into something?
[7894.92s -> 7898.30s]  Swap it with like a tree branches.
[7900.75s -> 7902.59s]  I could wear these if I found another one
[7902.59s -> 7913.22s]  and got a recipe.
[7913.22s -> 7914.82s]  You get two boots, you can make a pair of shoes.
[7914.82s -> 7923.02s]  It's funny.
[7923.02s -> 7929.02s]  Come on.
[7929.02s -> 7930.02s]  What is it, a tadpole?
[7930.98s -> 7931.82s]  Tadpole.
[7935.48s -> 7939.14s]  There's another fish over here.
[7939.14s -> 7939.98s]  A couple.
[7939.98s -> 7941.42s]  Oh, look it, there's a lot of fish in here.
[7956.78s -> 7958.50s]  I caught a carp.
[7958.50s -> 7960.78s]  I had another one, I could do a carpool.
[7960.78s -> 7961.86s]  Sure, swap it with.
[7968.93s -> 7974.02s]  I'm out of room.
[7974.02s -> 7983.08s]  Oh, I'm gonna get all the peaches and it's time to go.
[7983.08s -> 7985.52s]  I can grab the flowers.
[7985.52s -> 7990.51s]  Just actually pick them up, yeah.
[7990.51s -> 7992.03s]  Plant those goddamn flowers.
[7992.03s -> 7995.29s]  When I get back, I will.
[7995.29s -> 7997.49s]  Drop them, why?
[7997.49s -> 8000.01s]  Why would I do when you don't need peaches?
[8003.30s -> 8008.28s]  Can't I just, what's the point though?
[8008.28s -> 8009.20s]  Plant them in here.
[8011.18s -> 8013.02s]  Wait, aren't I just like leaving?
[8013.02s -> 8013.86s]  This is the mystery island.
[8013.86s -> 8020.26s]  You only just like leave after this and who gives a shit?
[8020.26s -> 8027.18s]  Wait, I come back here is what you're saying.
[8027.18s -> 8037.69s]  Oh, no you don't.
[8037.69s -> 8039.29s]  Oh, you never do, okay.
[8039.29s -> 8044.25s]  I want these flowers, I wanna keep them.
[8044.25s -> 8048.66s]  Plants are useless, aren't they?
[8048.66s -> 8052.98s]  The islands are just random.
[8052.98s -> 8054.18s]  You don't need so many.
[8058.66s -> 8068.13s]  All right, I need to make another hole.
[8068.13s -> 8073.87s]  I've already expelled that one for the cow.
[8073.87s -> 8077.18s]  I already got the cow, the cow's coming with me.
[8077.18s -> 8079.10s]  Keep plants, drop flowers.
[8095.18s -> 8113.50s]  Okay, so what should I pick up instead?
[8113.50s -> 8119.02s]  There's a centipede in here.
[8119.02s -> 8119.86s]  I hate it.
[8122.68s -> 8125.40s]  Another couple of fish?
[8125.40s -> 8126.84s]  I'll try to get another fish.
[8126.84s -> 8137.69s]  Every island has a piece of furniture in the trees.
[8137.69s -> 8140.65s]  Really?
[8140.65s -> 8146.34s]  Are you kidding?
[8146.34s -> 8149.69s]  Did I just get it?
[8149.69s -> 8151.53s]  What the hell was that?
[8151.53s -> 8154.48s]  Rattan wardrobe?
[8154.48s -> 8158.22s]  Well, okay.
[8158.22s -> 8160.96s]  Time to go.
[8160.96s -> 8161.96s]  But that's it.
[8161.96s -> 8164.02s]  I got everything I want.
[8164.02s -> 8172.69s]  Time to move.
[8172.69s -> 8174.94s]  Fun.
[8174.94s -> 8177.14s]  All right, let's go home.
[8177.14s -> 8178.30s]  What about the fish?
[8178.30s -> 8179.14s]  Huge fish.
[8181.09s -> 8184.47s]  All right, I'm gonna try to get the huge fish.
[8184.47s -> 8185.63s]  Huge fucking fish.
[8185.63s -> 8205.26s]  I'm going for it.
[8205.26s -> 8212.26s]  Come here.
[8212.26s -> 8222.87s]  Get it.
[8222.87s -> 8234.44s]  Whoa, I caught a koi.
[8234.44s -> 8236.50s]  Swap it with the mackerel.
[8236.50s -> 8242.20s]  I don't want the mackerel.
[8242.20s -> 8244.22s]  I got a koi.
[8244.22s -> 8252.37s]  There's another big one right here.
[8252.41s -> 8253.45s]  Koi is very rare.
[8253.45s -> 8256.34s]  Is it really?
[8256.34s -> 8257.18s]  Nice.
[8257.18s -> 8258.02s]  Is it really?
[8258.02s -> 8266.02s]  That's so cool.
[8266.02s -> 8267.50s]  It actually is.
[8267.50s -> 8268.34s]  Kind of.
[8268.34s -> 8274.73s]  Cool.
[8274.73s -> 8275.57s]  No!
[8275.57s -> 8290.60s]  It's okay.
[8290.60s -> 8293.50s]  Koi number two.
[8293.50s -> 8305.90s]  Okay.
[8305.90s -> 8309.36s]  Oh, should I get rid of the clay?
[8309.36s -> 8316.21s]  Should I throw my hat in the river?
[8316.21s -> 8317.61s]  Throw away the boot?
[8317.61s -> 8323.94s]  Okay, I'll throw the boot away.
[8323.94s -> 8324.78s]  Well, that was fun.
[8324.78s -> 8328.37s]  Time to go back.
[8328.37s -> 8329.33s]  No!
[8329.33s -> 8330.17s]  Get the boot.
[8330.17s -> 8331.09s]  Wait, get rid of the shovel.
[8331.09s -> 8334.06s]  Oh, I have a flimsy shovel, don't I?
[8334.06s -> 8338.02s]  Yeah, I can just drop this.
[8338.02s -> 8343.72s]  I'll pick the boot up.
[8343.72s -> 8344.92s]  I'm ready to leave.
[8344.92s -> 8345.76s]  That was fun.
[8349.04s -> 8350.12s]  I'm ready to go home.
[8356.46s -> 8357.54s]  I'm ready.
[8370.19s -> 8372.69s]  It is at this time in the stream
[8372.69s -> 8374.77s]  that I'm going to go appraise some of the stuff
[8374.77s -> 8375.61s]  and move stuff around,
[8375.61s -> 8377.65s]  but we're going to start doing the bits
[8377.65s -> 8385.60s]  as we're getting to the end of the stream.
[8385.60s -> 8389.49s]  We're going to hang out still.
[8389.49s -> 8392.25s]  It's time to say our goodbyes.
[8392.33s -> 8397.02s]  Probably four and a half days or so.
[8397.02s -> 8398.02s]  I'll see you guys very soon.
[8398.02s -> 8398.86s]  Hey, what's up?
[8398.86s -> 8401.01s]  Do you want to talk?
[8401.01s -> 8402.49s]  Are you getting stuff together to build us a shop?
[8402.49s -> 8403.69s]  Good, hustle.
[8403.69s -> 8404.77s]  I found something to help my things.
[8404.77s -> 8406.17s]  Here you go.
[8406.17s -> 8408.49s]  I can't carry this right now.
[8408.49s -> 8409.97s]  I was going to make that iron nugget
[8409.97s -> 8411.37s]  into an extra heavy free weight,
[8411.37s -> 8412.77s]  but having a shop's fine.
[8415.77s -> 8424.72s]  Okay.
[8424.72s -> 8426.28s]  So I'm going to put something on the screen
[8426.28s -> 8428.52s]  just so people realize that this is like kind of the end.
[8428.52s -> 8433.08s]  That people just know what's going on.
[8433.08s -> 8445.38s]  Text on the screen.
[8445.38s -> 8446.22s]  There.
[8446.22s -> 8452.52s]  So it says end of the stream, wind down.
[8452.52s -> 8461.91s]  So you know.
[8461.91s -> 8463.75s]  Library stream, please be quiet.
[8463.75s -> 8465.51s]  All right, so I got a bunch of stuff
[8465.51s -> 8468.72s]  and we're going to start going over the bits now.
[8468.72s -> 8471.38s]  Hey, that guy tag.
[8471.38s -> 8472.22s]  This is a long time ago.
[8472.22s -> 8475.25s]  This is like six and a half hours ago.
[8475.25s -> 8477.85s]  Thanks to the 1500 bits tag.
[8477.85s -> 8480.85s]  Newer USB 3.0 capture cards have no delay
[8480.85s -> 8484.38s]  so you don't have to do audio syncs with them.
[8484.38s -> 8486.18s]  Yeah, I'm just a fucking loser.
[8486.18s -> 8488.46s]  And I just, I'm using the same equipment
[8488.46s -> 8490.42s]  from like 2014.
[8492.42s -> 8493.94s]  That's pretty much all there is to it.
[8493.94s -> 8495.14s]  That's really what it is.
[8496.87s -> 8497.99s]  That's pretty much what it is.
[8497.99s -> 8499.19s]  I'm using the same equipment
[8499.19s -> 8502.56s]  from like six and a half years ago.
[8502.56s -> 8505.90s]  It is a true statement, but thanks tag.
[8505.90s -> 8509.42s]  Hey, new place after the move.
[8510.74s -> 8514.02s]  I'm going to be professional streamer, okay?
[8514.02s -> 8519.76s]  New place resolution, new year's resolution.
[8519.76s -> 8521.44s]  Thanks a lot tag, appreciate it.
[8521.44s -> 8524.64s]  Ooh, I can make sloshers, whatever they're called.
[8527.03s -> 8530.00s]  That's cool, but thanks a lot.
[8530.00s -> 8532.66s]  That's $15 from tag.
[8532.66s -> 8534.58s]  S10W update.
[8534.58s -> 8535.62s]  I know your name is slow update,
[8535.62s -> 8537.24s]  but I like saying it that way.
[8537.24s -> 8538.08s]  Thanks to the 250.
[8538.08s -> 8539.32s]  Hey, Jerm, I happen to be donating again.
[8539.32s -> 8542.00s]  Glad to see you in at least functioning condition.
[8542.00s -> 8542.92s]  Hope you're living your best life
[8542.92s -> 8545.86s]  and can't wait for the Jermania whenever that will happen.
[8545.86s -> 8546.86s]  Peace and love.
[8548.52s -> 8550.70s]  Hopefully at some point in the fall
[8550.70s -> 8553.20s]  is what it's going to be.
[8553.20s -> 8555.67s]  In the fall, that'll happen.
[8555.67s -> 8556.51s]  Wait, are you moving again?
[8556.51s -> 8558.14s]  Yes.
[8558.14s -> 8559.26s]  Staying in Las Vegas.
[8560.18s -> 8561.50s]  You can get a exclamation point
[8561.50s -> 8564.72s]  while you're moving, whatever the fuck the thing is.
[8564.72s -> 8570.69s]  I'm going to keep one of these toys.
[8570.69s -> 8572.49s]  But the game and the theater screen,
[8574.16s -> 8575.04s]  I don't really want to do that
[8575.04s -> 8577.28s]  because I'm kind of still playing it.
[8577.28s -> 8580.89s]  All right, can I make it like a fish pond?
[8580.89s -> 8583.38s]  Place item.
[8589.46s -> 8594.24s]  Oh, that's not enough room.
[8594.24s -> 8597.78s]  This needs to be like five times bigger.
[8597.78s -> 8599.10s]  Push table up against the wall.
[8599.10s -> 8600.50s]  I can't.
[8600.50s -> 8602.40s]  It's so small.
[8602.40s -> 8609.08s]  Well, I'm donating one to the museum.
[8609.08s -> 8612.12s]  But yeah, hopefully the Derma Rumble stuff.
[8612.12s -> 8613.92s]  That'll happen in the Boston Marathon.
[8613.92s -> 8618.75s]  If you don't know, it got pushed to hopefully in September.
[8618.75s -> 8621.75s]  So that's the whole point of having the stream there.
[8621.75s -> 8624.71s]  We've been sponsoring one of my friend's runs
[8624.71s -> 8625.55s]  in the Boston Marathon.
[8625.55s -> 8630.22s]  So let me go donate some of these things.
[8630.22s -> 8631.06s]  Thanks to the 250.
[8631.06s -> 8633.26s]  Thank you, GooBerry Juice of the 250.
[8633.26s -> 8635.06s]  Mini games for the mini streamer.
[8635.06s -> 8636.50s]  That's a laugh out loud moment.
[8636.50s -> 8641.25s]  Can't watch the stream tonight as I got work to do.
[8641.25s -> 8643.41s]  I hope you had fun nonetheless.
[8643.41s -> 8645.73s]  I hope your move goes well and you like your new place.
[8645.73s -> 8647.39s]  Me too.
[8647.39s -> 8649.39s]  Also make sure to give the Talics a can of beans
[8649.39s -> 8654.21s]  before you drive them out of the forest.
[8654.21s -> 8655.05s]  Thanks for the 250.
[8655.05s -> 8661.30s]  Oh, I can't donate anymore.
[8665.51s -> 8668.05s]  Wait, can I not donate anymore?
[8668.05s -> 8669.25s]  Until the museum's open?
[8670.60s -> 8671.44s]  Shit, okay.
[8671.44s -> 8676.18s]  Well, I guess that'll wait.
[8676.18s -> 8677.66s]  GooBerry Juice, thanks again for 250.
[8677.66s -> 8680.94s]  Also, I found your nudes, idiot.
[8680.94s -> 8682.10s]  Yeah, that was an accident.
[8682.10s -> 8682.94s]  That was an accident.
[8682.94s -> 8685.86s]  One accidental frame of my like bare shoulders.
[8685.86s -> 8688.54s]  Oh well.
[8688.54s -> 8689.70s]  You all know the photo.
[8689.70s -> 8692.24s]  It's okay.
[8692.24s -> 8693.80s]  Should I sell this other?
[8693.80s -> 8694.72s]  What else do I have?
[8694.72s -> 8696.72s]  Wait, I wanna plant these.
[8696.72s -> 8698.44s]  All right, I'm gonna plant.
[8698.44s -> 8700.94s]  Donald Duck, get out of the way.
[8700.94s -> 8709.62s]  I wanna plant those coconut trees.
[8709.62s -> 8711.10s]  I can't plant with other players in nearby.
[8711.10s -> 8716.85s]  Well, how do I chew them off here?
[8716.85s -> 8718.13s]  But thank you, GooBerry Juice.
[8718.13s -> 8719.70s]  Appreciate it.
[8719.70s -> 8722.30s]  I appreciate my nudes, I guess.
[8722.30s -> 8724.70s]  What?
[8724.70s -> 8727.71s]  Get out of the way.
[8727.71s -> 8732.50s]  Lizard Amiibo, thanks to the 250.
[8732.50s -> 8733.34s]  Lizard Amiibo says,
[8733.38s -> 8735.22s]  I'm sure it's my birthday on Wednesday.
[8735.22s -> 8736.94s]  Happy birthday on Wednesday.
[8738.88s -> 8742.94s]  Oh, there's plants on there.
[8742.94s -> 8745.46s]  Happy Wednesday birthday.
[8745.46s -> 8746.78s]  Not excited to spend it at home,
[8746.78s -> 8749.18s]  but I guess I'll just have to make the most of it.
[8749.18s -> 8750.38s]  Anyway, it's been a great stream already.
[8750.38s -> 8752.50s]  It's hard to go wrong with WarioWare.
[8752.50s -> 8754.10s]  The luck with whatever that stuff
[8754.10s -> 8757.99s]  you got going on this week and stay healthy.
[8757.99s -> 8759.74s]  I'm gonna try.
[8759.74s -> 8761.58s]  I tapped Donald.
[8761.58s -> 8763.22s]  Accidentally, I just touched him.
[8763.22s -> 8765.74s]  I just like poked him with the...
[8765.74s -> 8768.42s]  He got like the stick just like...
[8768.42s -> 8771.98s]  I'm trying not to poke him in the eye.
[8771.98s -> 8775.04s]  But happy birthday, Lizard Amiibo.
[8775.04s -> 8776.80s]  Wait, I'm gonna plant these up here.
[8776.80s -> 8779.24s]  Happy birthday on Wednesday.
[8779.24s -> 8788.58s]  I'm gonna go.
[8788.58s -> 8789.42s]  What?
[8790.22s -> 8791.66s]  Oh, I was trying to catch...
[8791.66s -> 8793.50s]  What the fuck?
[8793.50s -> 8795.06s]  He was hiding behind the tree.
[8796.02s -> 8797.36s]  Oh, whatever.
[8797.36s -> 8818.35s]  And here's my garden.
[8818.35s -> 8823.99s]  You got outsmited by a spider.
[8823.99s -> 8825.43s]  Nice.
[8825.43s -> 8827.63s]  Yeah, that's cool.
[8827.63s -> 8829.47s]  I'll have a big garden over there eventually.
[8829.51s -> 8830.95s]  Squiggity-squanky, thanks for the 250.
[8830.95s -> 8833.42s]  They say here it is.
[8833.42s -> 8834.30s]  I'm not sure what here it is.
[8834.30s -> 8840.68s]  It's a clip of something that says regret.
[8840.68s -> 8841.52s]  Oh, let me listen to this.
[8841.52s -> 8842.52s]  It's an ugly garden.
[8842.52s -> 8848.66s]  Well, it's gonna be ugly for a little while.
[8848.66s -> 8850.06s]  This is...
[8850.06s -> 8852.23s]  You guys hear it?
[8852.23s -> 8853.71s]  Turn this down for a second.
[8853.71s -> 8855.03s]  All right, I don't know what this is supposed to be,
[8855.03s -> 8856.47s]  but we'll find out together.
[8860.20s -> 8865.89s]  I got it.
[8865.89s -> 8867.65s]  I don't remember what this context is.
[8875.30s -> 8880.50s]  Anyways, thank you, squiggity-squanky.
[8880.50s -> 8884.74s]  Also, thank you to Archives for 500 bits.
[8884.74s -> 8886.69s]  Thank you, Archives.
[8886.69s -> 8888.88s]  Archives says,
[8888.88s -> 8890.48s]  Hey, Jerma, you may not be able to answer this question,
[8890.48s -> 8891.72s]  but I'm going to ask you
[8891.72s -> 8892.96s]  since you're one of my biggest inspirations.
[8892.96s -> 8894.48s]  When I stream, I get into this weird mode
[8894.48s -> 8896.36s]  where I feel like I'm not myself
[8896.36s -> 8897.72s]  because I'm in front of a live audience.
[8897.72s -> 8899.62s]  Do you have any experience with this?
[8899.62s -> 8901.42s]  I love streaming, but I can't seem to find the niche
[8901.42s -> 8903.50s]  where I'm comfortable and enjoy every stream.
[8903.50s -> 8905.66s]  Well, actually, I'm way more comfortable
[8905.66s -> 8909.09s]  in front of 10,000 people than I am in front of five.
[8909.09s -> 8911.86s]  So, I'm kind of the opposite way.
[8912.86s -> 8915.40s]  I could go in front of a stadium
[8915.40s -> 8917.88s]  and do anything and say anything,
[8917.88s -> 8919.72s]  but you put me in a room with less than 10 people
[8919.72s -> 8924.16s]  and I will have no fucking idea what to do.
[8924.16s -> 8925.36s]  It was 4,700 people.
[8925.36s -> 8927.28s]  Yeah, I'm rounding up.
[8927.28s -> 8930.08s]  I'm rounding up from, it was like 70,
[8930.08s -> 8933.06s]  it was 7,500 people here earlier.
[8933.06s -> 8934.30s]  I'm rounding up a little.
[8934.30s -> 8935.98s]  What, I can't round up on my resume?
[8935.98s -> 8942.05s]  Why not?
[8942.05s -> 8943.65s]  I mean, really all you can do with streaming
[8943.65s -> 8946.22s]  and trying to find what you want to do is just,
[8946.22s -> 8948.94s]  you just got to start throwing spaghetti at your fridge
[8948.98s -> 8950.78s]  and see what works, see what you like to do,
[8950.78s -> 8956.07s]  see how you feel and just try to do the best you can,
[8956.07s -> 8961.74s]  try to have the most fun you can and see what happens.
[8961.74s -> 8963.18s]  And trying to get more comfortable is,
[8963.18s -> 8970.94s]  I mean, that's a process back in like 2010.
[8970.94s -> 8972.30s]  I mean, I can't say that.
[8972.30s -> 8975.42s]  I mean, I guess I was kind of on base cam and stuff,
[8975.42s -> 8979.21s]  but I don't know.
[8979.21s -> 8982.88s]  I feel like I've always kind of just been,
[8982.88s -> 8984.58s]  I've always kind of just been
[8984.58s -> 8987.53s]  the annoying center of attention weirdo.
[8987.53s -> 8991.54s]  So, I've always been a look at me.
[8991.54s -> 8994.75s]  You know what I'm saying?
[8995.47s -> 8997.47s]  I've always been that like fucking annoying guy
[8997.47s -> 9000.19s]  that's like, hey, I have something to say today.
[9000.19s -> 9001.95s]  And everyone's like, okay, Jeremy's going to talk now.
[9001.95s -> 9003.59s]  But I guess we're all going to fucking just have to listen
[9003.59s -> 9005.35s]  for the next five straight minutes.
[9005.35s -> 9006.91s]  I'm going to pick up my phone
[9006.91s -> 9009.25s]  and just pretend to be listening.
[9009.25s -> 9012.48s]  So, I've kind of been uncomfortable doing it
[9012.48s -> 9017.78s]  for a long time.
[9017.78s -> 9020.02s]  But the best way to get better is to just to keep trying
[9020.02s -> 9022.10s]  and see what makes you comfortable.
[9022.10s -> 9022.94s]  Do the things you like to do,
[9022.94s -> 9024.10s]  play the games you like to play
[9024.10s -> 9026.14s]  and stream the way you want to stream.
[9026.14s -> 9028.38s]  It's your stream, remember, it's you.
[9028.38s -> 9032.90s]  It's you doing this.
[9032.90s -> 9034.22s]  He's wasting electricity.
[9034.22s -> 9038.01s]  No, I'm fucking tanning right now.
[9038.01s -> 9039.09s]  Come on.
[9039.09s -> 9040.57s]  Wait, where's my tanning light?
[9040.57s -> 9045.10s]  Here we go.
[9045.10s -> 9045.98s]  I wish you the best of luck though
[9045.98s -> 9050.76s]  with streaming and everything.
[9050.76s -> 9052.00s]  Heldrich, thanks for $5.
[9052.00s -> 9053.80s]  I saw you coming out of the Starbucks bathroom
[9053.80s -> 9054.92s]  chewing something,
[9054.92s -> 9057.95s]  but I was too anxious to ask you what it was.
[9057.95s -> 9059.27s]  I cannot fucking believe that.
[9059.27s -> 9060.39s]  I just read that without realizing
[9060.39s -> 9061.43s]  what they were talking about.
[9061.43s -> 9062.94s]  Thanks for $5.
[9062.94s -> 9065.46s]  A John with no H.
[9065.46s -> 9067.26s]  Thanks for the 500 vids.
[9067.26s -> 9071.30s]  Jerma after yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[9071.30s -> 9072.74s]  That's fucking funny.
[9072.74s -> 9074.14s]  Very hilarious.
[9074.14s -> 9076.99s]  All these kinds of words that you wrote down here.
[9076.99s -> 9078.19s]  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[9078.19s -> 9080.93s]  You also say, I just finished that BLT.
[9080.93s -> 9082.45s]  Uh-huh, I hope you enjoyed
[9082.45s -> 9084.86s]  that bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich,
[9084.86s -> 9087.67s]  a staple of America.
[9087.67s -> 9092.82s]  Yes, thank you for the $10, John.
[9092.82s -> 9094.74s]  I'm not even sure if you're still,
[9094.74s -> 9096.88s]  you might even be potentially banned.
[9096.88s -> 9106.65s]  I might even be speaking into the wall right now.
[9106.65s -> 9108.13s]  When is the next time you're gonna stream?
[9108.13s -> 9111.35s]  I will answer this for you.
[9111.35s -> 9112.63s]  I'll answer this for you
[9112.67s -> 9116.10s]  because the rest of your two bit comments
[9116.10s -> 9117.66s]  have been unreadable,
[9117.66s -> 9121.02s]  just absolutely un-fucking-readable.
[9121.02s -> 9123.86s]  When do I stream in the CBT time zone?
[9123.86s -> 9127.78s]  Well, I stream Pacific time,
[9127.78s -> 9129.26s]  which is the west coast of the United States.
[9129.26s -> 9131.48s]  I'm in Las Vegas, Nevada.
[9131.48s -> 9134.62s]  Thank you for your question and goodbye forever
[9134.62s -> 9136.18s]  because I probably won't see you again.
[9136.18s -> 9138.22s]  You may have been permanently banned.
[9138.22s -> 9142.94s]  Thank you, okay.
[9142.94s -> 9148.63s]  Anyways, ash686868, thanks for the thousand vids.
[9148.67s -> 9151.16s]  What a tyrant.
[9151.16s -> 9152.68s]  Here, I really have enjoyed your content
[9152.68s -> 9153.52s]  for a couple of years now
[9153.52s -> 9155.04s]  and I also love JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.
[9155.04s -> 9158.73s]  Can you say Killer Queen really loudly?
[9158.73s -> 9163.81s]  It's killer queen, laser beam.
[9163.81s -> 9167.70s]  What does that have to do with JoJo?
[9167.70s -> 9173.26s]  I don't get it.
[9173.26s -> 9175.62s]  There you go, thank you.
[9175.62s -> 9178.39s]  Thanks for the thousand vids.
[9178.39s -> 9180.43s]  The man with the baby hands, thanks for the thousand vids.
[9180.43s -> 9187.00s]  Die to Wario wear wheel, omega low.
[9187.00s -> 9189.10s]  That's just so loud.
[9189.10s -> 9191.04s]  I think I got a good 10.
[9191.04s -> 9195.94s]  Die to Wario wear wheel, sort of.
[9195.94s -> 9196.78s]  Not really though.
[9196.78s -> 9199.05s]  I'm gonna go sell a bunch of shit.
[9199.05s -> 9200.65s]  Wait, I got this wardrobe thing.
[9200.65s -> 9203.60s]  Let me see what it is.
[9203.60s -> 9207.13s]  Ooh, ugly.
[9207.13s -> 9207.97s]  And I don't want this.
[9207.97s -> 9218.78s]  Do I change?
[9218.78s -> 9223.06s]  No.
[9223.06s -> 9225.26s]  I'm not really into the wicker basket looking stuff
[9225.26s -> 9226.98s]  for furniture.
[9226.98s -> 9232.54s]  I mean, I'll keep it, but whatever.
[9232.54s -> 9236.72s]  Hey, Vibio Game, thanks for the 300 bits.
[9236.72s -> 9238.16s]  Vibio Game says, hey, Jeremy, thanks so much
[9238.16s -> 9240.66s]  for a fun run of streams the past few weeks.
[9240.66s -> 9242.74s]  I literally moved halfway around the world from home
[9242.74s -> 9245.26s]  just before all the virus stuff started
[9245.26s -> 9247.06s]  and your streams have really helped me keep
[9247.06s -> 9249.70s]  happy and sane during all the stress.
[9249.70s -> 9250.54s]  Best of luck with your move
[9250.54s -> 9253.70s]  and hope you keep safe and healthy.
[9253.70s -> 9257.26s]  Yeah, that's the worst part about moving now
[9257.26s -> 9259.98s]  is just, it was all planned.
[9259.98s -> 9262.30s]  Obviously, you try to make a plan as best you can
[9262.30s -> 9263.46s]  and then all this stuff started happening
[9263.46s -> 9266.37s]  and it's like, well, what do I do now?
[9268.14s -> 9270.58s]  Kim and I, we've been trying to figure out
[9270.58s -> 9272.18s]  the best course of action to do this
[9272.18s -> 9275.42s]  and stay healthy and avoid any potential issues
[9275.42s -> 9279.62s]  and it's just kind of tricky.
[9279.62s -> 9280.86s]  Game is too loud.
[9285.81s -> 9287.86s]  But we're gonna do our best.
[9287.86s -> 9289.79s]  That's all we can do.
[9289.83s -> 9292.01s]  Thank you, Vibio Game for the three dollars.
[9293.54s -> 9296.38s]  Moving halfway around the world seems like,
[9296.38s -> 9297.50s]  what the fuck is that thing?
[9297.50s -> 9298.54s]  Is this like a crater here?
[9298.54s -> 9301.30s]  What's this crater?
[9301.30s -> 9304.66s]  What is this thing?
[9304.66s -> 9310.33s]  Is this lava?
[9310.33s -> 9314.44s]  Look, I dug up a thousand bells.
[9314.44s -> 9315.28s]  What do I do?
[9315.28s -> 9320.28s]  What should I do with this?
[9320.28s -> 9322.82s]  Plant it back?
[9322.82s -> 9323.66s]  What do you mean plant it back?
[9323.66s -> 9327.07s]  Plant it back, bury in hole?
[9327.07s -> 9330.49s]  Put it back.
[9330.49s -> 9340.08s]  Whoa, am I gonna have a money tree?
[9340.08s -> 9340.92s]  Are you serious?
[9340.92s -> 9343.13s]  That's so cool.
[9343.13s -> 9346.92s]  I can actually have a money tree.
[9346.92s -> 9348.66s]  Wow.
[9348.66s -> 9349.50s]  Nice, that's cool.
[9349.50s -> 9354.05s]  I can't wait to see that in like nine days game time.
[9354.05s -> 9356.05s]  Hey John, with no H, there you are again.
[9356.05s -> 9357.97s]  Thanks for the 300 bits.
[9357.97s -> 9359.33s]  Jeremy, these are the last of my bits.
[9359.33s -> 9362.05s]  I'm done with the BLT joke.
[9362.05s -> 9363.41s]  Chat thought it was hilarious
[9363.41s -> 9366.13s]  and clearly your sense of humor is several levels lower
[9366.13s -> 9367.53s]  than mine because your initial reaction
[9367.53s -> 9369.33s]  was to have me timed out.
[9369.33s -> 9370.49s]  I love your stream and look forward
[9370.49s -> 9372.25s]  to the next time you use the Starbucks.
[9372.25s -> 9373.45s]  Yeah.
[9373.45s -> 9376.05s]  Yeah, my humor level is so much lower.
[9376.09s -> 9378.13s]  My humor level is just so,
[9378.13s -> 9380.85s]  like the 10 rungs down on the ladder underneath.
[9381.85s -> 9383.49s]  I can't even say it out loud.
[9383.49s -> 9385.69s]  You know what it is.
[9385.69s -> 9389.68s]  Make it permanent.
[9389.68s -> 9393.40s]  Yeah, I love, you know, let's, no, no.
[9393.40s -> 9394.72s]  All right, thank you.
[9394.72s -> 9399.35s]  See you later.
[9399.35s -> 9402.07s]  Thanks for the bits, I appreciate it.
[9402.07s -> 9405.28s]  But you've been 30 minute timed out.
[9405.28s -> 9407.52s]  That's right, I don't give those out that often.
[9407.52s -> 9409.84s]  That's a personal 30 minute timeout.
[9410.32s -> 9412.40s]  And not right now, on the night,
[9412.40s -> 9414.48s]  on the start of the, on the next,
[9414.48s -> 9417.92s]  on the night of the next start of the next stream,
[9417.92s -> 9419.08s]  it begins.
[9419.08s -> 9421.08s]  30 minutes for you.
[9421.08s -> 9423.12s]  The moment that the next stream turns on.
[9423.12s -> 9430.07s]  Oh, that's got to sting a little bit too, you don't it?
[9430.07s -> 9430.91s]  Thank you.
[9430.91s -> 9433.63s]  Hey, thanks, a normal user for the 300 bits.
[9433.63s -> 9439.36s]  Jeremy, you're stupid.
[9439.36s -> 9442.83s]  Thanks for the, thanks for the 300 money.
[9442.83s -> 9445.40s]  Thanks for the 300 bits.
[9445.40s -> 9447.08s]  The man with the baby hands thanks for 500 bits.
[9447.12s -> 9450.51s]  Of all the GameCube games you own,
[9450.51s -> 9454.66s]  you pick the one where you pick up trash for 90% of it.
[9454.66s -> 9456.30s]  That's fine.
[9456.30s -> 9458.95s]  What's wrong with that?
[9458.95s -> 9461.43s]  I wish I had a bigger net so I could catch bigger bugs.
[9461.43s -> 9462.75s]  Oh, what if I caught a bug so big
[9462.75s -> 9464.91s]  that I couldn't even lug it around?
[9464.91s -> 9468.17s]  I don't know.
[9468.17s -> 9473.66s]  Do you need a bigger net?
[9473.66s -> 9475.46s]  I don't know.
[9475.46s -> 9477.54s]  Morkus, Morkus, thanks for $30.
[9477.54s -> 9479.42s]  There's no message, just 30 bucks.
[9479.42s -> 9482.70s]  That's a big fucking drop.
[9482.70s -> 9486.70s]  Let me try to catch some fish here.
[9486.70s -> 9491.02s]  No message, just 3000 bits, just a bunch of money.
[9491.02s -> 9495.30s]  Thank you.
[9495.30s -> 9497.38s]  Come on, take it.
[9497.38s -> 9503.42s]  Please move the text that's fucking the animals talking.
[9503.42s -> 9508.86s]  Shit, you're right, here.
[9508.86s -> 9510.80s]  Thanks for the 30 bucks, man.
[9510.80s -> 9512.12s]  That's a lot of money just to give somebody
[9512.12s -> 9513.08s]  and there's just no messages.
[9513.08s -> 9515.58s]  Thanks for 30 bucks.
[9515.58s -> 9520.42s]  I wish I was at Olive Garden thanks for 300 bits.
[9520.42s -> 9526.91s]  Me too, man, me too, me too.
[9526.91s -> 9528.71s]  Map, map, map, map, map.
[9533.06s -> 9536.49s]  All right, there.
[9536.49s -> 9539.44s]  Kilkun, thanks for the 1000 bits.
[9539.44s -> 9540.96s]  I don't watch movies, I don't listen to music,
[9540.96s -> 9542.48s]  I don't watch TV.
[9542.48s -> 9544.52s]  What do you do to pass the time when not streaming?
[9544.52s -> 9546.00s]  Walk auto for three days?
[9546.88s -> 9548.40s]  No, talk into the mirror and pretend
[9548.40s -> 9550.56s]  that I'm in an Academy Award-winning movie.
[9552.86s -> 9561.30s]  I come up with, yeah, I make up my own TV shows in my mirror.
[9561.30s -> 9562.14s]  It's true?
[9562.14s -> 9563.82s]  You don't think it's true?
[9563.82s -> 9565.06s]  That's fine.
[9565.06s -> 9568.57s]  Oh, that's depressing.
[9582.34s -> 9585.48s]  I watch movie and TV shows.
[9585.48s -> 9591.26s]  Just not those five Universal Studios movies.
[9591.26s -> 9593.78s]  Thank you Keta Meme for the 255.
[9593.78s -> 9595.86s]  Would you say you're a boomer, zoomer, doomer, zoomer,
[9595.86s -> 9597.10s]  or the other one?
[9599.30s -> 9603.58s]  I'm just a, I'm a guy that fucking, I'm a guy.
[9603.58s -> 9605.02s]  That's it.
[9605.02s -> 9609.29s]  I'm a fucking millennial, okay?
[9609.29s -> 9612.09s]  I'm none of those things that you just described.
[9612.09s -> 9615.37s]  A crunch, thanks for the 300 bits.
[9615.37s -> 9617.65s]  First time donating a Twitch, hope I'm doing this right.
[9617.65s -> 9619.78s]  Seems like you are.
[9619.78s -> 9623.16s]  Anyways, since we brought up ET in the stream,
[9623.16s -> 9625.24s]  I'm taking the opportunity to bring up the official
[9625.24s -> 9627.68s]  Rushton ET doll when the movie came out.
[9627.68s -> 9629.40s]  They're so great and fucked up
[9629.40s -> 9632.20s]  and I'm lucky enough to have found one to own.
[9632.20s -> 9637.70s]  Wait, what?
[9637.70s -> 9641.32s]  This is supposed to be ET?
[9641.32s -> 9661.74s]  How the fuck is this ET?
[9661.74s -> 9663.58s]  That's ET.
[9663.58s -> 9665.59s]  Okay.
[9665.59s -> 9671.38s]  It seems impossible.
[9671.38s -> 9674.53s]  Bug, get the net, get the net, get the net.
[9674.53s -> 9675.49s]  I don't think I've seen this one yet.
[9675.49s -> 9680.66s]  This is like, this is a multi, I'm so bad at catching bugs.
[9680.82s -> 9681.66s]  It's depressing.
[9682.86s -> 9683.70s]  There we go.
[9684.34s -> 9692.06s]  So, thanks to the ET doll.
[9692.06s -> 9694.17s]  Thanks for the 300 bits.
[9694.17s -> 9695.85s]  Esparta Escalada, thanks for 250.
[9695.85s -> 9698.89s]  This is me watching you taking that quiz
[9698.89s -> 9701.77s]  over and over again.
[9701.77s -> 9703.73s]  Over for four seconds.
[9703.73s -> 9705.05s]  Did I get this one yet?
[9705.05s -> 9707.22s]  What is it?
[9707.22s -> 9709.70s]  Shut them ragtime music off.
[9709.70s -> 9714.74s]  This is like I live at Steakies Pizza.
[9714.74s -> 9716.95s]  Aquatine Hunger Force.
[9716.95s -> 9718.11s]  Good show.
[9718.11s -> 9719.87s]  Balloon, balloon, streamer alert.
[9719.87s -> 9721.87s]  Streamer alert, balloon, streamer alert,
[9721.87s -> 9723.99s]  streamer alert, streamer alert.
[9724.83s -> 9726.27s]  Alert.
[9726.27s -> 9728.55s]  I got it, I got it, I know I saw it.
[9728.55s -> 9731.27s]  First shot, second shot, guaranteed.
[9731.27s -> 9732.95s]  Third shot, guaranteed or I will never
[9732.95s -> 9734.47s]  stream on Twitch again, ever.
[9734.47s -> 9740.40s]  I will never stream again if I don't hit this right now.
[9740.40s -> 9748.52s]  Okay.
[9748.52s -> 9750.99s]  Pedal board?
[9750.99s -> 9755.62s]  What the fuck is a pedal board?
[9755.62s -> 9768.81s]  Wait, this is like a DJ table?
[9768.81s -> 9774.35s]  If I leave this out, is somebody gonna steal it?
[9774.35s -> 9775.19s]  Oh, cool.
[9775.19s -> 9777.43s]  Let's check my pedal board.
[9777.43s -> 9788.45s]  Achoo, achoo, achoo, achoo.
[9788.45s -> 9791.13s]  Hey, Friedl Schnitz.
[9791.13s -> 9792.21s]  Thanks for the 250.
[9792.21s -> 9793.17s]  Pleased with the love of God.
[9793.17s -> 9794.25s]  Watch Back to the Future.
[9794.25s -> 9796.05s]  I can't, not now.
[9796.05s -> 9798.20s]  Some other day.
[9798.20s -> 9799.40s]  Peaceful Haley, thanks for 250.
[9799.40s -> 9801.08s]  So you've never seen ET or Back to the Future,
[9801.08s -> 9803.60s]  but you've seen the shitty comedy Twins.
[9803.60s -> 9804.64s]  You are unbelievable.
[9804.64s -> 9807.16s]  Also, hope your penis is okay.
[9807.16s -> 9815.94s]  What?
[9815.94s -> 9816.78s]  What is it?
[9816.78s -> 9819.76s]  Oh my God.
[9819.76s -> 9822.72s]  Twins is a, I would rather watch Twins
[9822.72s -> 9823.64s]  than I can't say that.
[9823.64s -> 9825.80s]  Somebody will fucking probably murder me.
[9826.96s -> 9831.76s]  Twins is a cool movie.
[9831.76s -> 9833.36s]  Oh, the controller, right, right, right, right.
[9833.36s -> 9835.16s]  Let me sell this bugger.
[9835.16s -> 9836.20s]  Sell everything.
[9836.20s -> 9838.07s]  Sell it all.
[9838.07s -> 9841.40s]  Thank you, Peaceful Haley, appreciate it.
[9841.40s -> 9846.99s]  We also had Goiki5, more dolls from Goiki.
[9846.99s -> 9850.26s]  Thank you, Goiki.
[9850.26s -> 9852.70s]  Do you ever get the Tetris effect after you stream?
[9852.70s -> 9854.02s]  It's when you play a video game so much
[9854.02s -> 9857.08s]  when you see it when you close your eyes.
[9857.08s -> 9860.15s]  It happens to me all the time when I play Tetris.
[9860.15s -> 9861.51s]  Not really, that only happened.
[9861.55s -> 9864.98s]  It used to happen when I played Diablo 2,
[9864.98s -> 9870.26s]  but not anything recently.
[9870.26s -> 9871.94s]  Not anything recently.
[9871.94s -> 9877.51s]  I missed bits, what are you talking about, where?
[9877.51s -> 9880.80s]  Missed bits, missed bits, what are you talking about?
[9880.80s -> 9883.26s]  When, when, where?
[9883.26s -> 9891.89s]  What happened?
[9891.89s -> 9900.71s]  I got everybody so far.
[9900.71s -> 9909.18s]  Yeah, I got everybody so far.
[9909.18s -> 9910.90s]  According to my dashboard,
[9910.90s -> 9914.34s]  this is the list just going from bottom to top.
[9920.80s -> 9927.69s]  Yeah, what are you talking about?
[9927.69s -> 9931.78s]  Did they just come in?
[9931.78s -> 9935.42s]  Yeah, I'm going in descending order here.
[9938.82s -> 9944.42s]  This is how, what?
[9944.42s -> 9949.55s]  I'm going, these are bits from like three or four hours ago.
[9949.55s -> 9951.43s]  I'll get to it eventually, I'm gonna get there.
[9951.43s -> 9957.62s]  I'm gonna get there.
[9957.62s -> 9963.78s]  You skipped it already, they're not here.
[9963.78s -> 9978.70s]  I just, I'm refreshing, I don't see anything.
[9980.05s -> 9983.89s]  Not right, not where I am right now.
[9983.89s -> 9989.77s]  There's nothing here from like three or four hours ago.
[9989.77s -> 9995.16s]  Let's see if they pop up.
[9995.16s -> 9997.42s]  Let's see if they pop up eventually here.
[9997.42s -> 10000.41s]  But, let's keep going.
[10000.41s -> 10007.18s]  We left off right here, the Tetris effect.
[10007.18s -> 10011.06s]  That was Goiki for the Tetris effect.
[10011.06s -> 10012.30s]  Tar Alecron, thanks for 250.
[10012.30s -> 10015.06s]  Jeremy, you always backdate your Switch system.
[10015.06s -> 10017.89s]  You can always backdate your Switch until next week
[10017.89s -> 10020.37s]  so the game wouldn't realize that you hadn't played all week.
[10020.37s -> 10022.73s]  That way you could just resume like normal on stream
[10022.73s -> 10025.35s]  like it had only been one day.
[10025.35s -> 10029.62s]  I'd better rather just do it the way it's intended.
[10029.62s -> 10031.44s]  I'd rather do it the way it's intended.
[10031.44s -> 10034.12s]  Play it once a day.
[10034.12s -> 10035.84s]  Your text is blocking the bells.
[10035.84s -> 10039.96s]  It's fine, I wanna sell.
[10048.10s -> 10048.90s]  I'd rather just play it the way
[10048.90s -> 10053.86s]  it's normally intended to be played, you know.
[10053.86s -> 10058.85s]  I sell the coin, no, I gotta donate that one.
[10058.85s -> 10069.31s]  I can sell him a coconut tree, what the fuck?
[10069.31s -> 10072.79s]  9200 bells, holy shit.
[10072.79s -> 10074.78s]  That's a lot.
[10074.78s -> 10076.26s]  Spliceable Spleen, thanks for five dollars.
[10076.26s -> 10078.18s]  Hey Jerma, I saw a white Honda Civic
[10078.18s -> 10079.22s]  driving around Vegas the other day
[10079.22s -> 10080.90s]  with a license plate, Jerma's.
[10080.90s -> 10083.58s]  Can you confirm or deny that this was you?
[10085.57s -> 10088.80s]  Not me.
[10088.80s -> 10092.08s]  Also, I live near Henderson in the Las Vegas Valley.
[10092.08s -> 10093.84s]  Is that where you're headed in Vegas?
[10093.84s -> 10095.60s]  Thanks for all the quality content, man.
[10095.60s -> 10098.57s]  Best on your move.
[10098.57s -> 10101.38s]  There's a lot of places in Las Vegas.
[10101.38s -> 10104.66s]  A lot of places in Vegas, people to live
[10104.70s -> 10105.90s]  if they wanna live in places.
[10105.90s -> 10108.35s]  A lot of great places in Vegas.
[10108.35s -> 10110.03s]  A lot of people, about three million people
[10110.03s -> 10113.97s]  live in Las Vegas.
[10113.97s -> 10115.82s]  There's a lot of great places.
[10115.82s -> 10125.64s]  Thanks for the bits, appreciate that.
[10125.64s -> 10128.28s]  Actually, there are a lot of great places in Vegas.
[10128.28s -> 10129.64s]  He's turning into Trump.
[10131.96s -> 10133.96s]  There's a lot of great places in Vegas.
[10133.96s -> 10135.96s]  Beautiful places, wonderful places.
[10135.96s -> 10138.88s]  All the places in Vegas are great.
[10138.88s -> 10145.30s]  Is that close or far away from an Olive Garden?
[10145.30s -> 10150.30s]  Thank you, SpliceableSpleen, for the five dollars.
[10150.30s -> 10153.74s]  Hey, Kill, KillKun, thanks for five more dollars.
[10153.74s -> 10157.58s]  Are Poli-Politan Cuddles moving with you too?
[10157.58s -> 10158.98s]  No.
[10158.98s -> 10160.34s]  Tara Ollikorn, thanks for 250.
[10160.34s -> 10162.50s]  The odds that Jerma manages to move to a new house
[10162.50s -> 10164.02s]  set up as an internet properly
[10164.02s -> 10167.22s]  and find the motivation to stream is less than 0%.
[10167.22s -> 10169.38s]  If Jerma streams a real stream next Saturday,
[10169.38s -> 10172.75s]  I will give him permission to personally ban me for life.
[10172.75s -> 10175.51s]  I am, you've been around for a long time.
[10175.51s -> 10177.15s]  You've been around for a very long time,
[10177.15s -> 10180.06s]  but I do have to tell you something right now.
[10180.14s -> 10182.14s]  There are quite a few contingency plans.
[10182.14s -> 10184.38s]  If the internet does not work,
[10186.70s -> 10188.70s]  I will be streaming on Saturday.
[10188.70s -> 10190.58s]  You're about to be banned for life.
[10190.58s -> 10193.83s]  You've been around for like seven straight years.
[10193.83s -> 10197.67s]  So, I'm sorry, but we have to commit to this.
[10197.67s -> 10198.87s]  If I'm not live on Saturday,
[10198.87s -> 10199.95s]  then you're gonna get permanently banned.
[10199.95s -> 10205.98s]  You're gonna have to come back as Tara Ollikorn too.
[10205.98s -> 10207.38s]  I will be streaming on Saturday.
[10207.38s -> 10210.90s]  Like without question, less than 0%.
[10210.90s -> 10214.38s]  It is going to be 100%, 100%.
[10214.38s -> 10219.86s]  I will be live on Saturday, 100%.
[10219.86s -> 10220.70s]  I just made that.
[10220.70s -> 10225.06s]  Have fun being number three, you dick.
[10225.06s -> 10226.06s]  Thanks for the 250 though,
[10226.06s -> 10228.90s]  and have fun with your permanent ban.
[10228.90s -> 10232.86s]  Can't wait to see Tara Ollikorn 79,
[10232.86s -> 10234.66s]  or whatever the hell you're gonna have to make now.
[10234.66s -> 10236.98s]  Glow in the dark stars, thanks for $5.
[10236.98s -> 10241.66s]  He, hey, he sent a message earlier,
[10241.66s -> 10244.14s]  but it's a birthday from Lizard Amiibo.
[10244.14s -> 10246.18s]  It's Andy's birthday on the 25th.
[10246.18s -> 10247.82s]  He's an incredible dude and a fantastic friend.
[10247.82s -> 10249.02s]  He got me into watching your streams
[10249.02s -> 10251.46s]  and his friends wanted him to hear happy birthday again
[10251.46s -> 10253.10s]  from his favorite streamer.
[10253.10s -> 10256.95s]  Happy fucking birthday.
[10256.95s -> 10261.33s]  Happy birthday, Andy.
[10261.33s -> 10262.93s]  Thanks for the $5 glow in the dark stars.
[10262.93s -> 10263.93s]  Hope you have a good one.
[10263.93s -> 10267.10s]  Coming up.
[10267.10s -> 10269.96s]  Luigi man, thanks for 255 minutes into 30 minutes low mode.
[10269.96s -> 10279.11s]  I'm starving, please help.
[10279.11s -> 10280.39s]  You asked for this.
[10280.39s -> 10282.78s]  You guys wanted this shit.
[10282.78s -> 10286.58s]  Let me go look at the shopping center.
[10286.58s -> 10292.22s]  RTX42069TI, what a fucking unbelievable name.
[10292.22s -> 10302.40s]  Utility sync, I want one.
[10302.40s -> 10303.48s]  And I want a drying rack too.
[10303.48s -> 10304.32s]  No, I don't.
[10304.32s -> 10307.78s]  Why the fuck would I want one of those?
[10307.78s -> 10308.62s]  You say, hey Jeremy,
[10308.62s -> 10311.10s]  I'm happy you're branching out and playing City Skylines.
[10311.10s -> 10313.30s]  Just keep in mind that the City Skyline community swears
[10313.30s -> 10318.22s]  by absolute perfectionism and efficiency in design.
[10318.22s -> 10319.86s]  Oh, I know.
[10319.86s -> 10323.56s]  I know.
[10323.56s -> 10325.90s]  Oh, I know.
[10325.90s -> 10328.34s]  With some practice, I know you can become a loved mayor.
[10328.34s -> 10330.20s]  I think Chad is just mean.
[10330.20s -> 10331.96s]  You made a lot of progress over the last few streams.
[10331.96s -> 10333.40s]  I hope you play more of this game
[10333.40s -> 10348.37s]  and it's not just a 100 plus dollar joke.
[10348.37s -> 10353.37s]  Baby's first city builder is what you have to understand.
[10353.37s -> 10354.85s]  All right, that's the first time I ever played
[10354.85s -> 10357.55s]  any game like that.
[10357.55s -> 10363.66s]  No, my roads aren't gonna be fucking all at 90 degrees.
[10363.94s -> 10367.45s]  Some of you guys need to take a fucking bath, you know?
[10367.45s -> 10370.36s]  You need to take a bath with some Epsom salts in there
[10370.36s -> 10376.91s]  and just soak for a little bit.
[10376.91s -> 10379.42s]  I'm a more of a shower guy.
[10379.42s -> 10384.70s]  Should I pay this loan down for 10 grand?
[10384.70s -> 10389.58s]  I'll do 10,000 on it.
[10389.58s -> 10392.59s]  8600 lit, 36,000 lit.
[10392.59s -> 10395.46s]  All right, now I'm gonna deposit this money.
[10395.46s -> 10397.10s]  I get to play with like a bank account.
[10397.10s -> 10400.26s]  Look at this.
[10400.26s -> 10403.18s]  16,417, cool.
[10403.18s -> 10404.02s]  Hope you play more of it.
[10404.02s -> 10406.33s]  Um, I don't know, maybe.
[10406.33s -> 10409.38s]  Maybe, it depends.
[10409.38s -> 10413.28s]  I'd wanna get some mods for it or something.
[10413.28s -> 10414.76s]  Oh, I never got the hairstyles.
[10414.76s -> 10416.33s]  People are gonna be mad.
[10416.33s -> 10425.36s]  It's okay, it's okay.
[10425.36s -> 10427.28s]  But thank you to Rock Writing for the 300 bits.
[10427.28s -> 10429.36s]  Now realizing Jerma's villager,
[10429.36s -> 10435.64s]  walking around in an eye mask that resembles a maxi pad.
[10435.64s -> 10438.95s]  That's, that's like a,
[10438.95s -> 10440.31s]  is actually a nice metaphor for him
[10440.31s -> 10441.93s]  blindly bumbling around in the game,
[10441.93s -> 10443.29s]  but in the purest way possible.
[10443.29s -> 10446.91s]  Cool watching someone play AC for the first time.
[10446.91s -> 10447.75s]  And then we stay safe.
[10447.75s -> 10450.03s]  Everyone wishing on auto a peaceful move.
[10450.03s -> 10451.44s]  Thank you.
[10451.44s -> 10453.48s]  And thanks for imprint,
[10453.48s -> 10455.40s]  implanting that image into my brain
[10455.40s -> 10456.52s]  that I will never remove.
[10456.52s -> 10458.72s]  Until I remove this from my eyes.
[10458.72s -> 10462.53s]  Which will be later after this stream is over.
[10462.53s -> 10465.13s]  All right, what do I wanna do now before I leave?
[10465.13s -> 10465.97s]  Is that enough?
[10465.97s -> 10467.29s]  I think I did enough.
[10467.29s -> 10469.55s]  I can't really do much anymore.
[10469.55s -> 10472.06s]  Until tomorrow.
[10472.06s -> 10475.78s]  Okay, let's call it.
[10475.78s -> 10479.15s]  I, let me make sure the game's saved.
[10479.15s -> 10482.07s]  I will see you guys on Saturday,
[10482.07s -> 10484.19s]  guaranteed.
[10484.19s -> 10489.37s]  I don't care if I have to stream from my cell phone.
[10489.37s -> 10491.08s]  That guy's getting banned.
[10491.08s -> 10492.92s]  I'll make sure of it.
[10492.92s -> 10499.58s]  So let's actually do the actual wind down screen
[10499.58s -> 10506.02s]  and move there.
[10506.02s -> 10507.70s]  It's, it's, I'm not done.
[10507.70s -> 10511.60s]  Why do you guys, what's going on tonight?
[10511.60s -> 10513.16s]  This is how we do this every night.
[10513.16s -> 10522.17s]  What's going on here?
[10522.17s -> 10524.13s]  I'm a quick read, read, read, read, read, read, read.
[10524.13s -> 10537.83s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[10537.83s -> 10542.62s]  That's just the same.
[10542.62s -> 10545.99s]  All right, anyways, let's keep going.
[10545.99s -> 10550.37s]  Thank you to a literal fraud of 500 bits.
[10550.37s -> 10552.41s]  Jerma, we're gonna need to talk about this sneeze joke.
[10552.41s -> 10553.69s]  Man, it's not funny.
[10553.69s -> 10555.49s]  We need to realize that it's not funny.
[10555.49s -> 10556.33s]  It hasn't been funny.
[10556.33s -> 10559.85s]  Please, we're trying to get it through to you.
[10559.85s -> 10561.21s]  I thought it was funny.
[10561.21s -> 10564.71s]  I'm gonna keep pressing that fucking button
[10564.71s -> 10568.59s]  until the day I die.
[10568.59s -> 10569.95s]  Ozals, thanks for the 300 bits.
[10569.95s -> 10572.47s]  Hey, Jeremy, Olive Garden music one guy here.
[10573.95s -> 10575.79s]  Just wanted to say thanks for reading my shitty joke
[10575.79s -> 10578.15s]  and turning it into an amazing one guy moment.
[10578.15s -> 10581.51s]  Can we get one last BB unit before you move?
[10581.51s -> 10589.88s]  God.
[10589.88s -> 10595.71s]  All right, okay.
[10595.71s -> 10597.39s]  I'll get, this is gonna be the, I'm gonna give it to you.
[10597.39s -> 10601.76s]  This is gonna be so, I'm gonna do as hard as I can.
[10610.63s -> 10654.78s]  I just want to see.
[10654.78s -> 10658.14s]  That's like, I clenched so hard doing that.
[10658.14s -> 10658.98s]  There you go.
[10658.98s -> 10681.66s]  I'm never doing that ever again.
[10681.66s -> 10706.71s]  Okay, God damn it.
[10706.71s -> 10708.63s]  Hey, eggs scramble, thanks for the 250.
[10708.63s -> 10709.51s]  Hey Jerma, great stream.
[10709.51s -> 10711.39s]  You looked very nice and handsome today.
[10711.39s -> 10713.85s]  Thanks.
[10713.85s -> 10715.85s]  I know eating enough healthy food
[10715.85s -> 10717.93s]  can be really tough during busy times.
[10717.93s -> 10720.85s]  Chorizo, eggs, tortillas, white onions,
[10720.85s -> 10723.37s]  couscous, Swiss chard, gold potatoes, hummus,
[10723.37s -> 10725.37s]  Ezekiel bread, walnuts, ground turkey.
[10725.41s -> 10726.29s]  Have a good week, man.
[10726.29s -> 10727.13s]  Stay hydrated.
[10727.13s -> 10731.21s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[10731.21s -> 10733.25s]  Those are all delicious things,
[10733.25s -> 10737.98s]  but why are they all in a row?
[10737.98s -> 10740.18s]  Hey Spooky Fox, thanks for five dollars.
[10740.18s -> 10742.06s]  Here, me and my girlfriend are watching tonight
[10742.06s -> 10744.58s]  and I've been watching since like 2013.
[10744.58s -> 10746.86s]  She's really excited you're playing
[10746.86s -> 10750.85s]  Assassin's Animal Crossing.
[10750.85s -> 10751.85s]  I love you and your stuff
[10751.85s -> 10754.01s]  and also said girlfriend is thinking
[10754.01s -> 10755.41s]  of getting some rats at some point
[10755.41s -> 10760.55s]  and if she does, she might name one after you.
[10760.55s -> 10762.90s]  I'm honored.
[10762.90s -> 10764.82s]  I am honored.
[10764.82s -> 10769.23s]  I would love to be named after a rat, especially yours.
[10769.23s -> 10771.22s]  Thanks for the five dollars.
[10771.22s -> 10774.41s]  Jeremy the Rat.
[10774.41s -> 10777.97s]  That's okay, that's more of a name that you have
[10777.97s -> 10780.40s]  when you get beat up in prison
[10780.40s -> 10788.66s]  than a name that it would be for an animal,
[10788.66s -> 10792.85s]  but you know, thank you though.
[10792.85s -> 10795.25s]  Hey Keith King Crimson, thanks for the 250.
[10795.25s -> 10796.37s]  Most of the characters in Jojo
[10796.37s -> 10798.33s]  are named after music references.
[10798.33s -> 10799.81s]  Killer Queen is one of them.
[10799.81s -> 10802.93s]  Also the pro strat is to name yourself a Jojo reference
[10802.93s -> 10805.89s]  so Jermis says it out loud every time you donate.
[10805.89s -> 10808.54s]  Oh, I guess that makes sense then.
[10808.54s -> 10810.50s]  That's what your name is.
[10810.50s -> 10814.10s]  Keith King Crimson is the name of that person
[10814.10s -> 10818.22s]  that's in Jojo's, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.
[10818.22s -> 10822.23s]  Jojo's, I can hear myself talk now.
[10822.23s -> 10828.64s]  Jojo, Jojer, thanks.
[10828.64s -> 10830.24s]  I promised I would never do that again.
[10830.24s -> 10831.40s]  I didn't say I would stop streaming
[10831.40s -> 10835.59s]  if I did that again, right?
[10835.59s -> 10838.34s]  That wasn't part of the deal?
[10838.50s -> 10841.06s]  No, it wasn't, okay, good.
[10841.06s -> 10842.62s]  Hey Spunky Spade, there you are.
[10842.62s -> 10844.90s]  Thanks for the thousand bits.
[10844.90s -> 10846.46s]  Hey Jerm, I hope you're not mad at me
[10846.46s -> 10848.74s]  selling every drawing you've done in Animal Crossing.
[10848.74s -> 10849.74s]  I'm broke, but here's the bits
[10849.74s -> 10851.50s]  equal to the money I made from it.
[10858.61s -> 10861.73s]  Wait, are you the red bubble guy?
[10861.73s -> 10863.66s]  Are you the red bubble guy?
[10863.66s -> 10865.78s]  Are you the guy with like 300 listings?
[10873.32s -> 10875.38s]  It's him.
[10875.38s -> 10876.82s]  We got him.
[10876.82s -> 10878.38s]  It's him.
[10878.38s -> 10880.02s]  It's the red bubble guy.
[10883.26s -> 10887.48s]  Ha, we found him.
[10887.48s -> 10888.72s]  He outed himself.
[10888.72s -> 10896.30s]  We didn't have to do anything.
[10896.30s -> 10898.90s]  The, I'm the, hey, hey Jerm,
[10898.90s -> 10900.06s]  hey Jerm, we just wanted to let you know
[10900.06s -> 10906.18s]  I'm the red bubble guy, first and foremost.
[10906.18s -> 10908.06s]  Hey, thanks for the 10 bucks though.
[10908.06s -> 10915.47s]  Thank you.
[10915.47s -> 10917.35s]  Bulbaswag Desu, thanks for the five dollars.
[10917.35s -> 10918.87s]  Can you move the elephant on the right
[10918.87s -> 10920.63s]  one space to the right, please?
[10921.83s -> 10923.51s]  It's probably bad looking, it's okay.
[10923.51s -> 10925.80s]  I'll do it, I promise.
[10925.80s -> 10927.76s]  Hey Grave Embrace, thanks for three bucks.
[10927.76s -> 10930.72s]  Disney claimed a parody video depicting Bugs Bunny
[10931.40s -> 10932.24s]  as a, what?
[10937.68s -> 10946.93s]  What the fuck?
[10946.93s -> 10951.03s]  Okay, that's fucked up.
[10951.03s -> 10954.01s]  Thanks for the 300 bits.
[10954.01s -> 10955.77s]  Hey Celestial Maid, thanks for 300 bits.
[10955.77s -> 10958.21s]  Hey Jerma, I heard you generate electricity
[10958.21s -> 10960.05s]  and miniature lightning bolts while walking.
[10960.05s -> 10961.78s]  Is that true?
[10961.78s -> 10971.17s]  If it was, I'd probably be on the cover of Time Magazine.
[10971.17s -> 10974.74s]  The guy that can create electricity with his hands?
[10974.74s -> 10975.58s]  I'd be on there.
[10985.74s -> 10988.62s]  Hey Sammy Lant, thanks for the 300 bits.
[10988.62s -> 10991.62s]  I made something to help you with rocks.
[10991.62s -> 10999.71s]  This is a little chart for me.
[10999.71s -> 11001.70s]  Thank you.
[11001.70s -> 11007.21s]  A little rock chart?
[11007.21s -> 11010.50s]  You say that as if you're not gonna be on Time Magazine
[11010.50s -> 11013.46s]  as best streamer, I mean remember the carnival stream?
[11013.46s -> 11015.14s]  Yeah, but that's already over with.
[11015.14s -> 11020.14s]  Don't you go, guys, the internet has a memory
[11020.82s -> 11023.19s]  of about four days.
[11023.19s -> 11024.71s]  We gotta go, we gotta do more.
[11024.71s -> 11028.90s]  We gotta do more shit.
[11028.90s -> 11038.48s]  Time Magazine's already moved on from that.
[11038.48s -> 11040.00s]  If I'm gonna get on the cover of Time Magazine,
[11040.00s -> 11041.28s]  I'm gonna start to figure out
[11041.28s -> 11049.98s]  how to make electricity with my hands.
[11049.98s -> 11055.81s]  But thank you, Sammy Lant, for the 300 bits.
[11055.81s -> 11058.09s]  Toasty Knight, thanks for the 400 bits.
[11058.09s -> 11069.74s]  They say a-choo, a-choo, thanks for the 400 bits.
[11073.42s -> 11075.98s]  Hey John with no H for 500 bits.
[11075.98s -> 11077.50s]  It's the BLT guy again.
[11077.50s -> 11078.62s]  Hey Jerma, just want to apologize
[11078.62s -> 11081.02s]  for my statements earlier regarding a BLT.
[11081.02s -> 11082.98s]  I don't think I mentioned that,
[11082.98s -> 11088.97s]  well now you are getting banned.
[11088.97s -> 11094.32s]  It's like, you're hanging by a thread over like the cliff
[11094.32s -> 11095.92s]  and like I'm pulling you up
[11095.92s -> 11097.92s]  and there's like three other people
[11097.92s -> 11099.24s]  and I'm gonna pull you all up.
[11099.24s -> 11101.40s]  Oh no, I'm not strong enough.
[11101.40s -> 11102.56s]  I got you all, don't worry.
[11102.56s -> 11104.00s]  I think I can, no, one of us,
[11104.00s -> 11105.36s]  you have to let one of us go.
[11105.36s -> 11109.98s]  You just looked up and said, short streamer,
[11109.98s -> 11111.38s]  I'm gonna let you go.
[11111.38s -> 11115.15s]  I'm gonna be like, that's the guy I'm letting go.
[11115.15s -> 11127.30s]  Like you just made my decision so much easier.
[11127.78s -> 11132.20s]  You don't want me to have to use my like super strength
[11132.20s -> 11133.16s]  and pull everybody up.
[11133.16s -> 11135.80s]  All right, fine.
[11135.80s -> 11138.99s]  You're not big enough to save all three of us.
[11138.99s -> 11141.96s]  Well, you would be let go too.
[11141.96s -> 11147.55s]  You would, how many ropes do I have over the edge here?
[11147.55s -> 11149.39s]  Am I gonna have to let go of all of you?
[11149.39s -> 11151.78s]  Who am I pulling up here?
[11151.78s -> 11153.82s]  If you were holding onto the rope,
[11153.82s -> 11155.10s]  you're not gonna do this.
[11155.10s -> 11156.06s]  You're not gonna say this stuff
[11156.06s -> 11160.65s]  when you're hanging by the rope.
[11160.65s -> 11162.89s]  Pull me up, got it, got you.
[11162.89s -> 11164.41s]  Let them all go.
[11164.53s -> 11168.01s]  Now that's just, that's just a sicko thing.
[11168.01s -> 11169.93s]  That's just, you're fucking crazy.
[11169.93s -> 11177.83s]  You're pulling them all up as much as you can.
[11177.83s -> 11179.83s]  Hey, churro captain, thanks for 500 bits.
[11179.83s -> 11182.55s]  Hey, Jerma, are you gonna be using a Nook Miles ticket
[11182.55s -> 11185.96s]  when you move to your new place?
[11185.96s -> 11195.86s]  Yes, yes.
[11195.86s -> 11198.22s]  Let us go, we're nine inches off the ground.
[11203.72s -> 11208.80s]  You're so fucking funny.
[11208.80s -> 11212.64s]  It's so funny when I hear these things.
[11213.70s -> 11214.54s]  I go.
[11219.82s -> 11221.50s]  Let them go, let them all go.
[11221.50s -> 11222.98s]  Let them all go.
[11222.98s -> 11233.74s]  Just let them all go.
[11233.74s -> 11235.58s]  Ah, people are screaming.
[11239.04s -> 11239.88s]  Oh God.
[11240.76s -> 11244.66s]  Screaming at all caps.
[11244.66s -> 11247.02s]  Hey, egg scramble, thanks for the 250.
[11247.02s -> 11250.46s]  Yo, also my 21st birthday on Tuesday.
[11250.46s -> 11252.78s]  I'm gonna spend it alone in quarantine,
[11252.78s -> 11254.98s]  but your VODs are gonna get me through it.
[11254.98s -> 11257.38s]  Can you give me your favorite grocery list
[11257.38s -> 11259.18s]  as an early birthday present?
[11259.18s -> 11265.35s]  Yes, Cliff Bars, a bunch of them.
[11265.35s -> 11268.15s]  Campbell's Soups, a bunch of them.
[11268.15s -> 11270.35s]  Tons of Cliff Bars, make sure, and this is,
[11270.35s -> 11271.67s]  you might be able to,
[11271.67s -> 11273.47s]  oh, here comes another advertisement for a company
[11273.47s -> 11275.79s]  that there's no money involved here.
[11276.79s -> 11279.71s]  Cliff Bars are, they're delicious.
[11279.71s -> 11288.12s]  They're very filling and they'll carry you a long time.
[11288.12s -> 11292.32s]  I got a bunch of them.
[11292.32s -> 11295.48s]  Also, stuff like boxed macaroni and cheese
[11295.48s -> 11298.63s]  is really, really easy to store.
[11298.63s -> 11301.15s]  Soups, canned soups are very easy to store,
[11301.15s -> 11303.24s]  and they're good.
[11303.24s -> 11307.78s]  Tuna fish, tuna fish, it keeps forever,
[11307.78s -> 11309.54s]  and it can be used in a million different places.
[11309.54s -> 11312.54s]  You can eat that shit out of the can.
[11312.54s -> 11324.45s]  There you go, that's my grocery list.
[11324.45s -> 11327.02s]  Don't forget baby food.
[11327.02s -> 11329.37s]  Yeah, you get that too.
[11329.37s -> 11330.29s]  Eight-year-old diet?
[11330.29s -> 11331.73s]  No, I mean, we're talking about,
[11334.14s -> 11335.82s]  we're talking about the quarantine stuff,
[11335.82s -> 11337.66s]  and stuff they can easily,
[11337.66s -> 11341.74s]  guys, I'm not eating tuna fish out of the can every day.
[11341.74s -> 11344.82s]  We're talking about preparing for potentially
[11344.82s -> 11351.40s]  having to be in your house for two or three weeks.
[11351.40s -> 11357.37s]  Non-perishables, that's correct.
[11357.37s -> 11359.17s]  Peanut butter is another good one.
[11359.17s -> 11360.81s]  Rice is another good one.
[11360.81s -> 11362.93s]  Although, rice is kind of hard to find
[11362.93s -> 11367.40s]  during these kinds of people that go into the store
[11367.40s -> 11368.72s]  and they're buying up everything they can.
[11368.72s -> 11371.26s]  Peanut butter is great.
[11371.26s -> 11372.58s]  Beans are great.
[11372.58s -> 11375.02s]  If you like refried beans, just get a bunch of them.
[11375.06s -> 11377.30s]  You can just eat them.
[11377.30s -> 11383.10s]  Do what you can, right?
[11383.10s -> 11394.70s]  I could eat refried beans every day.
[11394.70s -> 11399.50s]  Stop talking about tuna, sorry.
[11399.50s -> 11401.18s]  But I wish you the best of luck.
[11401.18s -> 11404.26s]  Everybody around the world is currently
[11404.26s -> 11406.30s]  at a standstill right now,
[11406.30s -> 11408.42s]  hoping that this shit just goes away
[11408.42s -> 11413.32s]  and we can just kind of hunker down and get through it.
[11413.32s -> 11418.15s]  Let's hope so.
[11418.15s -> 11421.39s]  Hey, TarAlecran2.
[11421.39s -> 11424.71s]  Hey, Jerma, I'm holding the TarAlecran2 username hostage.
[11424.71s -> 11427.83s]  If TarAlecran wants TarAlecran2,
[11427.83s -> 11431.00s]  I need a bean burrito.
[11431.00s -> 11431.96s]  Well, that has nothing to do with me.
[11431.96s -> 11434.24s]  That is between the two of you.
[11434.24s -> 11437.00s]  That is between the two, that is between you two.
[11437.00s -> 11441.00s]  That's between you and TarAlecran2
[11441.00s -> 11444.63s]  and TarAlecran is between you two, the two of you.
[11444.63s -> 11446.33s]  Nothing to do with me.
[11446.33s -> 11448.29s]  Hey, GooBerryJuice, thanks for the 300 bits chat
[11448.29s -> 11461.11s]  whenever someone mentions JoJo.
[11461.11s -> 11464.66s]  No hate, I know everyone has their tastes.
[11464.66s -> 11466.70s]  We don't all have to like the same things
[11466.70s -> 11468.38s]  to love each other.
[11468.38s -> 11470.90s]  Also, there's new hairstyles in AC Mirror,
[11470.90s -> 11477.18s]  one of which looks like yours.
[11477.18s -> 11479.62s]  I just don't even, I have no say in any of this
[11479.62s -> 11482.38s]  because I've never seen the damn show.
[11482.38s -> 11486.30s]  I don't even know what the show is.
[11486.30s -> 11492.19s]  That show could star vegetables and fruits and shit
[11492.19s -> 11494.55s]  and I would be like, okay, that JoJo's Bizarre Adventure,
[11494.55s -> 11499.38s]  JoJo's a banana and he has his band of strawberries
[11499.38s -> 11501.94s]  and fruits and shit and like vegetables.
[11501.94s -> 11504.70s]  I'd be like, okay, that's a weird TV show, I guess.
[11504.70s -> 11510.07s]  I wouldn't even, I don't even know what it would be.
[11510.07s -> 11514.32s]  Seems like it could be, I don't know, I've never seen it.
[11514.32s -> 11516.04s]  Hey, Kirunch, thanks for the 500 bits.
[11516.04s -> 11518.00s]  Hey, LateBits, sorry about that.
[11518.00s -> 11520.86s]  Don't have to say sorry, we're just hanging out.
[11520.86s -> 11523.86s]  I just got confirmed as far as I know for my first job
[11523.86s -> 11526.94s]  and I've been wanting to donate to you for a while.
[11526.94s -> 11528.10s]  Wanted to do it the day I started it,
[11528.10s -> 11530.66s]  but it looks like you'll be off streaming when it happens,
[11530.66s -> 11533.50s]  so I'll send them over what I currently can early.
[11533.50s -> 11535.22s]  I'm a newer viewer.
[11535.22s -> 11538.02s]  I just think you're genuine cool and I wanna help out,
[11538.94s -> 11539.78s]  I wish you the best during your move
[11539.78s -> 11541.94s]  and during our weird pandemic times
[11541.94s -> 11546.38s]  as well as everybody in chat.
[11546.38s -> 11551.15s]  I really appreciate that, but take care of yourself.
[11551.15s -> 11552.67s]  Make sure you're taken care of.
[11552.67s -> 11554.35s]  Make sure you're taking care of your loved ones,
[11554.35s -> 11558.44s]  your friends, your family.
[11558.44s -> 11563.46s]  Take care of you, I hope you do.
[11563.46s -> 11567.99s]  And thanks for checking out the stream when you did.
[11567.99s -> 11576.10s]  Say you're a newer viewer, so I'm not sure how new,
[11576.10s -> 11587.14s]  but thank you and good luck on the new job.
[11587.14s -> 11591.43s]  We had 250 from Pigeon.
[11591.43s -> 11592.27s]  Thanks, Pigeon.
[11592.27s -> 11593.87s]  Hey, Germa, it's your favorite bird.
[11593.87s -> 11596.15s]  It's been a while, but college plus a boyfriend
[11596.15s -> 11599.27s]  has hindered my ability to watch all your streams.
[11599.27s -> 11601.23s]  Though I try to keep up on the archive.
[11602.31s -> 11605.35s]  Cue the you don't have to feel pressure to watch spiel.
[11605.35s -> 11606.39s]  I was gonna do it.
[11606.39s -> 11607.67s]  I was gonna do it.
[11607.67s -> 11609.51s]  You already took the words right out of my mouth.
[11609.51s -> 11611.03s]  But now with all my classes moving online,
[11611.03s -> 11613.19s]  I have a lot of more time.
[11613.19s -> 11615.51s]  Wish I could tell you that you've been super productive.
[11615.51s -> 11617.27s]  Oh, I've been super productive.
[11617.27s -> 11620.23s]  But honestly, I've just been catching up on video games
[11620.31s -> 11622.11s]  and I've been able to watch your streams again.
[11622.11s -> 11623.31s]  It's good to be back.
[11623.31s -> 11629.21s]  Love you.
[11629.21s -> 11631.33s]  You don't have to, yeah, yeah, yada, yada, yada,
[11631.33s -> 11633.54s]  the thing I was just gonna say.
[11633.54s -> 11634.66s]  If you have time and you're around
[11634.66s -> 11642.31s]  and you wanna hang out, then by all means, absolutely.
[11642.31s -> 11645.95s]  But I think we're all kinda catching up on video games
[11645.95s -> 11657.17s]  and sort of stuff to do in your house.
[11657.17s -> 11658.13s]  He hates us.
[11658.13s -> 11658.97s]  What?
[11662.68s -> 11667.46s]  Why did you just write that?
[11667.46s -> 11669.70s]  Doctor says, boyfriend sucks.
[11669.70s -> 11671.96s]  Oh yeah, I forgot about that.
[11671.96s -> 11673.83s]  Thanks a lot, Pigeon.
[11673.83s -> 11675.63s]  Good to see you again.
[11675.63s -> 11679.63s]  Hey, Keith King Crimson from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.
[11679.63s -> 11680.47s]  Thanks for the 250.
[11680.47s -> 11681.63s]  What if you went to Olive Garden
[11681.63s -> 11683.23s]  and ordered endless breadsticks
[11683.23s -> 11685.15s]  but the waiter brought out a single,
[11685.15s -> 11687.83s]  really long breadstick that stretched all the way
[11687.83s -> 11689.11s]  to the back of the kitchen?
[11689.11s -> 11691.19s]  And no matter how much you ate, more breadstick
[11691.19s -> 11695.14s]  just kept coming out of the kitchen with no end in sight.
[11695.14s -> 11697.10s]  Well, I would be a little disgusted
[11697.10s -> 11699.50s]  because how would that not touch other people?
[11700.42s -> 11702.06s]  How would that gigantic breadstick?
[11702.06s -> 11703.58s]  Some people are gonna be stepping over that.
[11703.58s -> 11704.54s]  Somebody might bump into it.
[11704.54s -> 11706.62s]  Somebody might put their shoe on it.
[11706.62s -> 11707.50s]  Somebody's gonna step on it.
[11707.50s -> 11708.74s]  I'm not eating that.
[11708.74s -> 11718.72s]  No, it's gonna be limbo.
[11718.72s -> 11720.08s]  But what if it's in a tube
[11720.08s -> 11722.44s]  and it comes out the end of the tube?
[11722.44s -> 11726.64s]  I would ask very, very, I'd eat some of it.
[11726.64s -> 11731.37s]  And after about two or three loaves of bread worth of bread,
[11731.37s -> 11734.38s]  I'd say, who's the guy that spent 40 grand
[11734.38s -> 11739.78s]  to make this a reality and why is it only on my table?
[11739.78s -> 11742.38s]  I see over there, that couple over there
[11742.38s -> 11744.48s]  has regular breadsticks.
[11745.44s -> 11746.84s]  And that group of friends over there
[11746.84s -> 11748.36s]  has regular soups and shit.
[11748.36s -> 11750.95s]  Why are you doing this to me?
[11750.95s -> 11753.47s]  And then you hear just a wheeze laugh
[11753.47s -> 11762.41s]  deep within the kitchen, just like a fucking wheeze laugh.
[11762.89s -> 11764.61s]  I was gonna do the wheeze laugh.
[11764.61s -> 11767.73s]  I was gonna smash it out, but I didn't
[11767.73s -> 11773.55s]  because I didn't wanna exert my chest cavity.
[11773.55s -> 11776.02s]  Pretend I did.
[11776.02s -> 11779.01s]  Hey, let's run those credits.
[11779.01s -> 11781.13s]  And again, I will see you guys.
[11781.13s -> 11786.14s]  Garin, Teed, Saturday, Garin Teed.
[11786.14s -> 11792.66s]  If there is no stream on Saturday, then I have hell to pay.
[11792.66s -> 11798.16s]  Saturday afternoon, I will be live at Garin fucking Teed.
[11798.28s -> 11799.12s]  I gotta stop swearing.
[11799.12s -> 11801.16s]  You know, my mother told me to stop swearing.
[11801.16s -> 11802.86s]  I tell you that.
[11802.86s -> 11804.80s]  My mother caught one of my streams recently.
[11804.80s -> 11806.18s]  She's like, oh, that was like really interesting
[11806.18s -> 11807.02s]  and really fun.
[11807.02s -> 11808.74s]  Can you stop, you gotta stop swearing.
[11808.74s -> 11813.34s]  And I was like, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma.
[11813.34s -> 11814.78s]  She's like, no, I want you to stop swearing.
[11814.78s -> 11819.84s]  And I'm like, ma.
[11819.84s -> 11825.08s]  So as of Saturday, I'm gonna say 25% less swear words.
[11826.95s -> 11829.02s]  We're gonna clean it up a little bit.
[11829.02s -> 11833.02s]  So instead of fuck, it's gonna be shoot.
[11833.02s -> 11835.94s]  And instead of shit, it's gonna be crap.
[11835.94s -> 11844.42s]  And instead of booger, it's gonna be snot.
[11844.42s -> 11845.98s]  I don't know.
[11845.98s -> 11847.82s]  Shoot.
[11847.90s -> 11849.14s]  Crap is just as bad.
[11849.14s -> 11849.98s]  No, it's not.
[11849.98s -> 11852.03s]  I'm kidding.
[11852.03s -> 11854.43s]  My mother said three swears telling me in the sentence
[11854.43s -> 11857.79s]  to tell me to stop swearing, to stop swearing.
[11857.79s -> 11859.94s]  And she swore like four times.
[11859.94s -> 11864.60s]  We're a swearing family.
[11864.60s -> 11867.31s]  Anyways, here come the credits.
[11867.31s -> 11869.84s]  They should be showing up on your screen now
[11869.84s -> 11872.84s]  in about 10 seconds or so.
[11872.84s -> 11874.71s]  Here they come.
[11874.71s -> 11875.59s]  Thanks everybody for your subs.
[11875.59s -> 11878.19s]  All of the new subs, all tubs, all the ongoing subs,
[11878.19s -> 11881.11s]  all the subs that maybe you subbed like 12 months ago
[11881.11s -> 11882.03s]  and you never did.
[11882.03s -> 11883.63s]  Maybe you got a community sub from somebody.
[11883.67s -> 11886.80s]  Maybe you subbed like four years ago or whatever.
[11886.80s -> 11888.36s]  Thanks for even considering.
[11888.36s -> 11889.56s]  Appreciate it.
[11889.56s -> 11891.66s]  All of you.
[11891.66s -> 11893.70s]  We're gonna finish up the bits.
[11893.70s -> 11897.14s]  We have a couple more to do.
[11897.14s -> 11900.38s]  We have Cosmocrat for the 300 bits here, three bucks.
[11900.38s -> 11902.22s]  Hey, Jerma, awesome stream as always.
[11902.22s -> 11903.54s]  You should play Hearthstone on Saturday.
[11903.54s -> 11904.46s]  Not gonna happen.
[11904.46s -> 11905.46s]  We'll buy you packs.
[11905.46s -> 11906.38s]  Not gonna happen.
[11906.38s -> 11908.66s]  Also really stupid, outdated question.
[11908.66s -> 11911.30s]  When you fake proposed to Kim on your moving to Vegas stream,
[11911.30s -> 11912.12s]  was she in on it?
[11912.12s -> 11913.84s]  Yes.
[11913.84s -> 11914.82s]  I would not do that to somebody.
[11914.82s -> 11919.02s]  That's so fucking horrible.
[11919.02s -> 11919.86s]  Play Smite.
[11920.62s -> 11923.58s]  Is this like a, are you guys plants?
[11923.58s -> 11927.53s]  Are you guys plants?
[11927.53s -> 11934.21s]  What's with the plants here about like play Smite?
[11934.21s -> 11935.17s]  It's working.
[11935.17s -> 11937.65s]  Just wanna let you know, your scheme is working.
[11937.65s -> 11940.36s]  You've got me thinking about it again.
[11940.36s -> 11942.96s]  What I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna go lie down in my bed
[11942.96s -> 11945.32s]  with my iPad and just look at all the stats
[11945.32s -> 11946.68s]  for all the gods that have released
[11946.68s -> 11949.81s]  in two and a half, three years.
[11949.81s -> 11954.42s]  It's working.
[11954.42s -> 11959.07s]  Hey, FrozenThor516, thanks for the 250.
[11959.07s -> 11960.71s]  Hey, Jerma, today when I was watching this stream,
[11960.71s -> 11963.99s]  my country New Zealand went into level three lockdown
[11963.99s -> 11965.79s]  and going to level four lockdown
[11965.79s -> 11968.34s]  at 48 hours because of the virus.
[11968.34s -> 11970.23s]  I'll be at home for a month.
[11970.23s -> 11972.95s]  Luckily, on the plus side, I'll be able to tune
[11972.95s -> 11976.48s]  into all your live streams for one month.
[11976.48s -> 11979.34s]  Stay safe out there, Jerma, and you chat.
[11979.34s -> 11980.16s]  Lots of love to all of you.
[11980.16s -> 11983.62s]  Also side note, no game you ever played has ever bored me.
[11983.62s -> 11988.18s]  I dare you to find a game I will hate you playing.
[11988.18s -> 11992.84s]  Please step right this way to Mountain Blade
[11992.84s -> 11998.86s]  or Europa Universe sales or Crusader Kings.
[11998.86s -> 12000.06s]  No one will want me to play those games.
[12000.06s -> 12001.80s]  I don't know you guys say those things.
[12001.80s -> 12006.04s]  If I play Crusader Kings, I will actually lose fans.
[12006.04s -> 12008.80s]  People that are like fans of this channel
[12008.80s -> 12013.62s]  will flip 180 degrees if I play Crusader Kings
[12013.62s -> 12015.20s]  for more than four or five hours.
[12015.20s -> 12018.13s]  I'm just telling you facts.
[12018.13s -> 12020.41s]  I would be so unbearable.
[12020.41s -> 12022.94s]  I would be so unbearable.
[12024.14s -> 12029.45s]  People would be, I couldn't even, you know.
[12034.12s -> 12041.05s]  See you guys on Saturday.
[12041.05s -> 12043.65s]  An anonymous cheer right at the very end, $10.
[12043.65s -> 12048.94s]  No message, just an anonymous amount of money.
[12048.94s -> 12051.73s]  Take care of yourselves.
[12051.73s -> 12054.33s]  Enjoy this week coming up here.
[12054.33s -> 12059.54s]  I will be back on Saturday at the latest.
[12059.54s -> 12063.10s]  I have to reiterate this one more time.
[12063.10s -> 12066.32s]  The latest you will see me is Saturday afternoon.
[12066.32s -> 12070.64s]  And that is a 100% guarantee this should not take very long.
[12070.64s -> 12071.60s]  Take care.
[12071.60s -> 12072.48s]  Much love to you.
[12072.48s -> 12076.48s]  Stay safe.
[12076.48s -> 12079.23s]  See you soon.
[12079.23s -> 12118.62s]  Take care.
[12118.62s -> 12119.82s]  Missed bits.
[12119.82s -> 12120.66s]  I did?
[12120.66s -> 12123.34s]  No, I didn't.
[12123.34s -> 12125.47s]  Are you guys gonna raid Joel?
[12125.47s -> 12129.53s]  How's he doing?
[12129.53s -> 12130.37s]  Joel, what?
[12130.37s -> 12132.82s]  Raid Joel.
[12132.82s -> 12137.18s]  Playing Super Mario World?
[12137.18s -> 12139.94s]  All right, let's go diarrhea over on Joel's channel.
[12139.94s -> 12141.14s]  See you guys next week.
