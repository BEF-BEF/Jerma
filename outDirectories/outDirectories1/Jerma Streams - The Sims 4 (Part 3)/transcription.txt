[1.21s -> 8.90s]  Let me tell you something about Origin, okay? Here comes a five minute Origin Rage.
[8.90s -> 14.50s]  Right? That guy right now just wrote that and was just like, I fucking knew it.
[14.50s -> 22.52s]  And it was a joke. I'm good to go. How you guys doing?
[22.52s -> 30.55s]  And if it's your first time on the stream, my name is Jeremy. Your name is Dan.
[30.55s -> 34.04s]  One of your name is Dan. Hope you're doing good.
[38.14s -> 45.86s]  No, no Rage tonight. Not tonight. I'm gonna do Minecraft VR.
[45.86s -> 55.66s]  Not today. On the next VR stream, I'm gonna do Minecraft VR.
[61.42s -> 67.34s]  Am I drinking? I am not drinking. No. Not tonight.
[67.90s -> 73.93s]  Not gonna drink tonight. No. Because I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow.
[74.57s -> 81.37s]  So I'm not gonna drink a bunch of booze and then go to a doctor's appointment the next day.
[82.17s -> 95.62s]  So that means there's no stream tomorrow because that appointment is
[96.58s -> 98.74s]  right in the middle of the kind of evening afternoon.
[99.62s -> 115.59s]  Boomer health. Have I heard that Sims 4 has first person mode?
[116.39s -> 118.79s]  Yes, it is kind of the reason why I'm doing this stream.
[119.99s -> 123.53s]  I have a shitload of mods. If you remember, if you were here,
[124.41s -> 134.58s]  if you're part of the channel about a year ago, we did Sims 4 with a bunch of dog shit going on.
[135.30s -> 138.63s]  What's with the- I don't know what the word dog shit is with me lately.
[138.71s -> 141.27s]  It's like the fourth or fifth time I've said it.
[142.17s -> 144.73s]  Oh, dog shit. You know, I got lots of dog shit.
[145.37s -> 148.82s]  I need to extend the vocabulary today.
[150.89s -> 154.41s]  Uh, that was in November, December, January, February, March, April.
[154.41s -> 155.93s]  All right, so it's been like four or five months.
[156.65s -> 160.10s]  No, it's been longer than that.
[162.87s -> 165.11s]  No, no, that's been- it's been longer than that.
[165.11s -> 167.03s]  I wasn't in Vegas during that stream.
[167.83s -> 172.23s]  Yeah, that was like j- that was like June of last year.
[173.11s -> 178.41s]  I was not in Vegas during the Sims 4 stream.
[178.41s -> 183.35s]  Oh yeah, no, that was a long time ago.
[192.63s -> 194.15s]  So it's been just about seven months.
[194.87s -> 196.39s]  Has it really been that long?
[199.93s -> 202.73s]  I can't believe- I like- thinking about it out loud is like,
[202.73s -> 204.25s]  oh yeah, it's been like just under a year.
[204.25s -> 205.77s]  It's been like seven months.
[206.49s -> 210.39s]  It's like, man, I feel like that was like two months ago.
[210.39s -> 215.91s]  And then again, I think about it, I've lived in Vegas now for almost five months.
[215.91s -> 217.19s]  It's like, didn't I just get here?
[217.99s -> 218.87s]  I just got here.
[224.01s -> 224.49s]  Strange.
[225.05s -> 228.41s]  But anyways, uh, a lot of you probably weren't here.
[228.41s -> 231.77s]  During those streams and what this stream is going to be is a continuation of that.
[234.10s -> 234.90s]  Mods.
[234.90s -> 235.46s]  Lots of them.
[237.32s -> 238.52s]  Sims killing each other.
[239.08s -> 240.20s]  Sims doing drugs.
[240.20s -> 241.16s]  Animals doing drugs.
[242.34s -> 243.46s]  I got a bunch more too.
[244.18s -> 246.66s]  There's at least two or three other mods you have not seen yet.
[246.66s -> 249.98s]  And first person, figured we would give it a try.
[253.40s -> 254.36s]  No sex mods.
[254.36s -> 255.24s]  I'm not doing that.
[255.96s -> 257.08s]  I cannot do that.
[257.80s -> 258.87s]  Did you get more?
[258.87s -> 259.59s]  I did get more.
[263.67s -> 266.95s]  No, sex mods would get me actually in trouble with the platform.
[267.67s -> 278.15s]  Am I ever going to do a normal Sims game?
[278.15s -> 279.91s]  No, I can't after this.
[281.82s -> 287.10s]  After like watching Sims get chewed up by chainsaws, I can't go back and play the Sims.
[290.44s -> 291.72s]  We tried to do that.
[291.72s -> 292.20s]  Do you remember?
[293.00s -> 294.84s]  And I'm going to put a rule on this stream too.
[296.54s -> 300.38s]  Because once you climb over that hill, you just start to fall down.
[300.38s -> 302.30s]  You hit the peak and you just start tumbling.
[303.72s -> 308.04s]  The first person that gets a knife in their back is the catalyst to the snowball.
[309.27s -> 310.71s]  So we got to be prepared for it.
[311.35s -> 320.12s]  Anyways, are you ready to make the new family?
[329.27s -> 332.07s]  Because we're not doing old family gone.
[332.07s -> 333.11s]  New family coming in.
[335.86s -> 337.06s]  The Elbertsons 2.
[337.06s -> 338.66s]  We need a better name than that.
[338.66s -> 343.74s]  Let's go ahead and turn this off here.
[348.41s -> 351.21s]  Yeah, I don't know how important any of this shit is.
[351.85s -> 355.75s]  There's a weird thing about The Sims 4, right?
[357.69s -> 360.81s]  Does this have the most DLC out of any video game ever made?
[360.81s -> 361.45s]  It really might.
[364.84s -> 365.72s]  I don't even have this.
[366.60s -> 367.48s]  Get famous.
[368.12s -> 372.55s]  I don't have the get famous collection.
[374.17s -> 374.81s]  Look at all this though.
[374.81s -> 375.61s]  Game packs.
[376.65s -> 377.53s]  Stuff packs.
[378.81s -> 380.73s]  I don't even want any of it.
[380.73s -> 384.31s]  It doesn't have all the DLC.
[384.31s -> 386.79s]  It's just like 600 bucks for all this shit.
[387.94s -> 390.10s]  Each one of these is like $19.99.
[390.74s -> 395.78s]  You want me to spend 12 grand on The Sims 4?
[401.77s -> 403.85s]  Train Simulator has more DLC.
[404.49s -> 405.13s]  Yeah, it does.
[410.89s -> 413.13s]  EA Omega Lul.
[415.19s -> 416.63s]  I got BTTV.
[416.63s -> 417.75s]  Buy the vampire pack?
[417.75s -> 419.11s]  The vampire pack is not...
[419.11s -> 419.91s]  Okay, listen.
[421.43s -> 422.39s]  The Sims.
[422.39s -> 423.19s]  Strangerville.
[423.19s -> 428.31s]  Start your investigation and solve the mystery of a desert town that holds a dark, deep,
[428.31s -> 429.75s]  dark secret.
[429.75s -> 434.71s]  Guys, chainsaws can go through people's heads in our mod we have right now.
[434.71s -> 437.38s]  Do you really give a shit about this?
[439.08s -> 439.88s]  The Sims.
[439.88s -> 441.00s]  Jungle adventure.
[441.00s -> 443.72s]  Take your Sims on a mysterious adventure into the wild.
[443.72s -> 445.80s]  Discover new things, new cultures.
[446.52s -> 449.99s]  A guy can do acid and like pee on his floor.
[452.02s -> 454.90s]  This is all small potatoes to what we're doing here.
[460.78s -> 463.26s]  New family time.
[463.26s -> 470.54s]  Are you ready?
[470.54s -> 472.14s]  I'm not gonna buy the DLC.
[472.70s -> 476.31s]  All right, so you're probably looking at...
[476.31s -> 476.55s]  You've got...
[476.55s -> 478.97s]  Look, you see resume playing Bill.
[478.97s -> 481.37s]  That's because I had to make sure the mods worked.
[481.37s -> 483.13s]  So I had to just make a person.
[484.28s -> 485.56s]  Don't worry, we're gonna revict them.
[488.81s -> 490.25s]  You didn't see that, okay?
[490.25s -> 491.37s]  You didn't see that.
[491.37s -> 501.02s]  I just needed to make sure that they worked.
[502.46s -> 503.42s]  All right.
[503.42s -> 505.64s]  I don't want to live here, by the way.
[505.64s -> 505.88s]  We...
[505.88s -> 507.00s]  What did we do last time?
[507.00s -> 513.70s]  I want to try a different place because we got Willow Creek, Oasis Springs.
[513.70s -> 514.82s]  Anyone remember where we lived?
[515.30s -> 520.42s]  I think we lived like in Newcrest or something.
[520.42s -> 525.56s]  Going to the city?
[526.94s -> 527.42s]  Newcrest?
[530.76s -> 531.24s]  I think we did...
[531.24s -> 532.84s]  Oh yeah, we did the desert last time.
[532.84s -> 534.28s]  Let's do Newcrest.
[535.10s -> 535.66s]  Newcrest.
[537.42s -> 538.86s]  Or the Night City, this one.
[543.38s -> 544.26s]  Boring.
[544.26s -> 544.82s]  Boring.
[546.52s -> 549.43s]  This one.
[549.43s -> 551.43s]  Yeah, but is it always nighttime here?
[553.61s -> 554.89s]  I don't like that.
[554.89s -> 556.73s]  You want it to be always nighttime?
[556.73s -> 562.79s]  Look, it's fucking always nighttime.
[565.70s -> 569.34s]  Oh cool, there's like a gym here?
[569.34s -> 570.62s]  Planet Honey Pop.
[571.18s -> 573.06s]  Karaoke bar.
[573.06s -> 577.34s]  Okay.
[579.75s -> 585.02s]  Uh, what the...
[585.02s -> 585.58s]  That's...
[585.58s -> 586.46s]  Why the...
[586.46s -> 587.66s]  Okay, I'm freaking out right now.
[587.66s -> 588.22s]  All right, anyways.
[588.94s -> 590.06s]  Where the hell am I supposed to live?
[590.78s -> 593.88s]  You want me to live in like one of these fucking apartments?
[597.43s -> 597.75s]  I have...
[597.75s -> 599.11s]  I'm gonna have a huge family.
[599.11s -> 601.83s]  There's gonna be a bunch of like dogs, cats, aliens.
[601.83s -> 606.22s]  You want me to live in one of these like New York City high rises?
[608.15s -> 610.87s]  Superior Cream just came in 50 bucks from Superior Cream.
[613.46s -> 615.14s]  Thank you so much, Superior Cream.
[616.54s -> 617.66s]  Five zero.
[617.66s -> 618.14s]  Fifty.
[621.54s -> 622.04s]  And...
[623.22s -> 625.29s]  They say, I'm Michael, it's my birthday today.
[625.29s -> 626.57s]  Cake and ice cream is on its way.
[626.57s -> 629.99s]  Thought I'd share some birthday cheer for all the best content.
[629.99s -> 630.71s]  Thank you so much.
[632.09s -> 633.05s]  Happy birthday.
[633.05s -> 635.13s]  You shouldn't be giving me money on your birthday.
[635.13s -> 640.06s]  But thanks a lot.
[640.06s -> 641.50s]  Means a fucking shitload.
[641.50s -> 644.22s]  Hope you have a fantastic birthday.
[644.22s -> 645.82s]  Thanks for joining us for your birthday.
[645.82s -> 646.46s]  Where are we going?
[646.46s -> 647.50s]  Uh, map.
[647.50s -> 653.98s]  Can I live in the art studio?
[653.98s -> 655.10s]  Studio apartments?
[657.06s -> 658.50s]  House apartments?
[658.50s -> 662.06s]  What about this one?
[662.06s -> 670.63s]  No, I don't want to live in the city.
[670.63s -> 671.43s]  Art family.
[673.46s -> 674.02s]  Not fine.
[674.02s -> 674.50s]  All right.
[674.50s -> 679.38s]  This is going to be the ship family.
[679.38s -> 680.34s]  Let us click.
[682.18s -> 683.14s]  Okay, all right, fine.
[683.86s -> 686.41s]  Fine, you guys get to pick where I live.
[686.41s -> 688.58s]  I have to be able to afford it though.
[688.58s -> 689.94s]  No, I don't have any money.
[689.94s -> 691.30s]  Are these places expensive?
[691.94s -> 693.74s]  They are.
[693.74s -> 700.12s]  I think these places are actually really expensive.
[700.12s -> 701.96s]  Just cheat and add money.
[702.60s -> 704.49s]  I could do that.
[704.49s -> 706.01s]  It's Control Shift C, right?
[706.01s -> 707.93s]  I need to use it for one of the mods I have anyways.
[709.96s -> 710.68s]  All right, here you go.
[711.48s -> 712.49s]  Where am I living?
[723.10s -> 724.06s]  Wow, very divided.
[726.12s -> 727.88s]  Exceptionally divided it seems.
[731.54s -> 732.66s]  I can't live in the park.
[738.60s -> 739.56s]  I can't live here.
[739.56s -> 740.68s]  I don't know why you're clicking it.
[750.18s -> 752.02s]  Can I live in here?
[756.10s -> 757.14s]  This is the one it seems.
[757.14s -> 758.34s]  Okay, all two apartments.
[768.36s -> 769.00s]  No way to do it.
[769.00s -> 770.36s]  All right, all right, hold on, hold on.
[770.36s -> 772.28s]  Wait, let's do this actually democratically.
[772.28s -> 772.60s]  Hold on.
[773.24s -> 778.60s]  You ready?
[778.60s -> 785.59s]  Go for it.
[785.59s -> 787.43s]  I want the true democratic experience.
[794.52s -> 795.08s]  That doesn't matter.
[795.08s -> 804.47s]  Everybody wants me to live in the night town.
[804.47s -> 806.54s]  I'm not buying this.
[806.54s -> 807.98s]  I'm not going to buy these.
[808.82s -> 810.66s]  No, no, I refuse 100%.
[810.66s -> 814.42s]  I'm going here.
[814.42s -> 814.90s]  Ready?
[814.90s -> 815.86s]  Now pick the place.
[815.86s -> 818.73s]  Three, two, one, go for it.
[818.73s -> 820.73s]  This is the only choice that you guys are going to get the whole stream.
[820.73s -> 821.93s]  So make it count.
[831.53s -> 832.81s]  I got to cheat and give myself money.
[832.81s -> 834.17s]  I don't know if the cheat is to do that though.
[843.03s -> 844.23s]  Why does everybody want me to live here?
[847.27s -> 848.47s]  Mother load, okay.
[848.47s -> 859.18s]  Did I do it?
[859.18s -> 863.18s]  Did that work?
[863.18s -> 870.42s]  I have to have a family first, okay.
[870.42s -> 871.62s]  All right, so this is where we're going.
[871.62s -> 873.78s]  We're going to go to this auto apartments.
[873.78s -> 874.82s]  Thank you for voting.
[874.82s -> 877.08s]  Let's go make the family.
[877.08s -> 884.63s]  Welcome to the next, probably at least hour of the spring.
[884.63s -> 886.71s]  And everyone that has, there you go.
[886.71s -> 887.51s]  You're about to see why.
[888.07s -> 889.27s]  Kind of don't want to change anything.
[896.02s -> 897.54s]  For like three hours.
[898.18s -> 912.15s]  Okay, I got to get the cheat thing off.
[918.86s -> 919.58s]  Forehead.
[927.43s -> 928.31s]  It made it perfect.
[928.31s -> 933.83s]  I don't know what I even want to do here.
[933.83s -> 936.23s]  All right, first of all, let's get out of this.
[936.23s -> 938.52s]  Let's do some detail work on the head.
[938.52s -> 940.42s]  Always start on the head.
[940.42s -> 944.74s]  It looks like daisy duck.
[944.74s -> 946.66s]  Well, let's go ahead and make daisy duck.
[954.82s -> 955.86s]  Daisy duck?
[956.50s -> 958.42s]  Like Donald Duck's girlfriend?
[958.42s -> 960.74s]  Donald Duck's like fiance?
[961.46s -> 963.38s]  That's, is that who daisy duck is?
[963.94s -> 970.87s]  How does this look like daisy duck?
[970.87s -> 978.42s]  All right, let's keep this, let's go.
[978.42s -> 979.94s]  So let's get, I want to do some detail here.
[983.51s -> 984.47s]  Bring the lips down.
[985.03s -> 995.51s]  Okay, let's go with a bit more fat on the outside.
[996.15s -> 1000.98s]  Forehead being down looks fine.
[1006.71s -> 1007.43s]  Now bring this in.
[1007.99s -> 1014.33s]  Should we see the eyes?
[1014.33s -> 1015.29s]  I don't think so.
[1015.29s -> 1021.66s]  All right, now all the way down.
[1021.66s -> 1032.01s]  A little, maybe a little bit skinnier.
[1042.20s -> 1047.77s]  I liked it the way it was.
[1047.77s -> 1055.88s]  No, no, no, we can't make like another chuck schnozwell.
[1055.88s -> 1056.52s]  That's good.
[1056.52s -> 1061.13s]  Like that.
[1061.13s -> 1066.92s]  Put the nose right at the top of the mouth.
[1066.92s -> 1069.70s]  Now that actually looks like a duck.
[1069.70s -> 1072.60s]  Why don't just make the duck, right?
[1072.60s -> 1083.59s]  That works, right?
[1083.59s -> 1085.19s]  All right, let's back it up a little bit.
[1087.03s -> 1088.87s]  That actually scared the shit out of me.
[1088.87s -> 1091.59s]  I jumped a little bit backwards.
[1091.59s -> 1094.62s]  I want to grab the cheat.
[1094.62s -> 1095.74s]  I got to get rid of the hair.
[1095.74s -> 1099.58s]  Oops.
[1099.58s -> 1104.46s]  No, no, the head's way too big.
[1104.46s -> 1105.10s]  There we go.
[1106.50s -> 1107.62s]  Harry, Harry, you got to go.
[1109.13s -> 1118.47s]  Let's get something different here.
[1118.47s -> 1119.19s]  I like this one.
[1134.07s -> 1134.79s]  Not bad.
[1134.79s -> 1135.43s]  I don't hate it.
[1139.51s -> 1140.79s]  No, I don't want the nose.
[1140.79s -> 1142.71s]  The nose doesn't do it for me right now.
[1142.71s -> 1157.13s]  No, pull it back.
[1157.13s -> 1157.93s]  Uh-oh.
[1157.93s -> 1163.11s]  I think I've ruined it forever.
[1163.11s -> 1163.59s]  There we go.
[1163.59s -> 1168.84s]  Okay.
[1168.84s -> 1169.80s]  Yeah, I prefer...
[1171.24s -> 1173.00s]  The nose makes it just too weird.
[1173.00s -> 1185.53s]  That looks better.
[1185.53s -> 1188.76s]  Okay.
[1189.38s -> 1194.65s]  The hair, though, needs to be changed.
[1194.65s -> 1196.49s]  I don't hate this.
[1196.49s -> 1199.37s]  That looks fine.
[1199.37s -> 1202.30s]  Hold on, wait.
[1202.30s -> 1204.86s]  What about just like the Marge Simpson?
[1204.86s -> 1207.67s]  It's not the Marge Simpson, but...
[1212.71s -> 1215.38s]  The forehead needs to be bigger.
[1215.38s -> 1217.62s]  I'm not sure I can even make the forehead bigger.
[1222.39s -> 1223.19s]  Oh, shit.
[1228.09s -> 1228.73s]  Fixed.
[1228.73s -> 1238.41s]  Don't worry, fixed.
[1238.41s -> 1238.89s]  No, that's...
[1238.89s -> 1240.33s]  I can't make the forehead any bigger.
[1240.89s -> 1242.12s]  That's what you got.
[1246.12s -> 1248.52s]  Ooh, he's a head shape.
[1248.52s -> 1249.32s]  No, no, no.
[1249.32s -> 1251.91s]  We'll keep that hair.
[1251.91s -> 1252.79s]  No accessories.
[1253.35s -> 1254.33s]  Oh, it's makeup.
[1254.33s -> 1254.89s]  Okay.
[1254.89s -> 1255.45s]  No hats.
[1258.47s -> 1259.27s]  Makeup.
[1259.27s -> 1263.91s]  Should we just have big eyes up here?
[1263.91s -> 1264.47s]  Can I do that?
[1264.47s -> 1265.43s]  Can I paint that myself?
[1266.07s -> 1273.22s]  Holy shit.
[1273.22s -> 1274.02s]  That's terrifying.
[1274.58s -> 1284.06s]  Is there a way I can do this myself?
[1285.72s -> 1287.80s]  Eyes, cheeks, face paint.
[1287.80s -> 1288.20s]  There's no way.
[1288.20s -> 1289.08s]  Can I not just do it?
[1289.72s -> 1294.20s]  I made Dory from Finding Nemo.
[1294.20s -> 1301.40s]  Okay, let's mess around here.
[1302.12s -> 1304.17s]  The wrench at the bottom.
[1309.85s -> 1310.89s]  At the bottom, like here.
[1312.28s -> 1313.72s]  What the fuck is that?
[1314.52s -> 1315.40s]  I don't know what that is.
[1315.96s -> 1316.92s]  I don't know what that is.
[1320.15s -> 1328.82s]  That just burst out.
[1333.27s -> 1334.15s]  Holy shit.
[1335.11s -> 1337.35s]  Why is that under face paint?
[1337.91s -> 1345.00s]  All right, whatever.
[1345.00s -> 1345.96s]  That's fine.
[1345.96s -> 1351.48s]  Now, let's go back to here.
[1351.48s -> 1353.45s]  Change some stuff around here.
[1353.45s -> 1359.34s]  Should we just give her a little like goat feet?
[1359.34s -> 1368.92s]  That looks fine.
[1372.89s -> 1374.46s]  Let's bring those shoulders in.
[1375.45s -> 1377.21s]  Extend the arms out a little bit.
[1377.21s -> 1389.13s]  Need to have like...
[1390.25s -> 1393.59s]  All right, what about...
[1393.59s -> 1394.47s]  Oh Christ.
[1394.47s -> 1401.16s]  Okay, hold on.
[1401.16s -> 1402.36s]  Big like thick neck.
[1405.82s -> 1406.54s]  The pear.
[1406.54s -> 1408.06s]  All right, we made the pear.
[1416.33s -> 1420.87s]  Okay, and then let's have...
[1420.87s -> 1429.88s]  That's all right.
[1429.88s -> 1431.40s]  No, it needs to be the color.
[1431.40s -> 1432.44s]  I got to get the right color here.
[1434.81s -> 1438.07s]  Is it just a onesie that you can put on?
[1438.07s -> 1443.14s]  No, no, that's not going to work.
[1443.14s -> 1449.18s]  Can I just put her in a big pear colored onesie?
[1449.18s -> 1450.06s]  I don't know if that is it.
[1450.06s -> 1450.78s]  I'm afraid to plug it.
[1452.22s -> 1453.80s]  I don't know what this is.
[1453.80s -> 1456.38s]  I'm terrified.
[1456.38s -> 1458.84s]  Oh, it just makes them invisible.
[1465.66s -> 1467.18s]  But what would that be for?
[1467.82s -> 1469.10s]  Just a floating person?
[1469.90s -> 1470.86s]  A ghost lady?
[1470.86s -> 1474.49s]  I don't know.
[1474.49s -> 1475.13s]  What is this?
[1476.60s -> 1477.72s]  Oh, just a dress.
[1479.51s -> 1480.63s]  That's not bad.
[1480.63s -> 1481.91s]  That's kind of a pretty good pear.
[1487.00s -> 1487.72s]  I like this one.
[1493.45s -> 1493.93s]  There we go.
[1497.05s -> 1498.49s]  Yeah, like Pauline Pear.
[1500.33s -> 1502.25s]  We need a last name here.
[1502.25s -> 1510.87s]  The pear family?
[1511.51s -> 1514.62s]  No, this is not going to be the pear family.
[1514.62s -> 1519.82s]  That means every single person has to have their last name be pear.
[1519.82s -> 1524.09s]  Do you want me to make a series of fruits?
[1524.09s -> 1525.21s]  The fruit family?
[1525.21s -> 1529.45s]  You just want them to be all like bananas, apples, and oranges and shit?
[1537.56s -> 1539.00s]  Is this worth three hours?
[1539.64s -> 1557.06s]  Can I make...
[1558.02s -> 1564.20s]  Okay, is there...
[1564.20s -> 1565.56s]  All right, so this we got...
[1565.56s -> 1567.08s]  Is this a green apple?
[1568.15s -> 1569.59s]  Is this blueberry?
[1574.20s -> 1577.22s]  Oh, can I do a custom color?
[1582.58s -> 1586.04s]  I hate this.
[1586.04s -> 1590.97s]  I don't want to continue doing this.
[1590.97s -> 1592.41s]  Because we're going to have like an apple.
[1592.41s -> 1593.45s]  We're going to have a blueberry.
[1593.45s -> 1595.21s]  We're going to have a banana.
[1596.73s -> 1597.29s]  Is there like...
[1599.24s -> 1599.96s]  All right, fine.
[1602.94s -> 1604.22s]  This lipstick's got to go though.
[1606.46s -> 1608.30s]  Okay, we have to have more than one family.
[1608.30s -> 1609.58s]  You guys understand that, right?
[1609.58s -> 1613.18s]  Because this is going to be a drug dealer.
[1613.18s -> 1614.70s]  This is going to be animals.
[1614.70s -> 1620.62s]  We're going all out tonight.
[1620.62s -> 1621.98s]  Make a vegetable family?
[1621.98s -> 1627.27s]  No.
[1627.27s -> 1629.11s]  Make the whole city food.
[1632.79s -> 1634.07s]  How am I going to do that?
[1636.38s -> 1638.94s]  It's just fruits, vegetables, meats, and cheeses?
[1639.90s -> 1641.18s]  Take the food land?
[1646.86s -> 1649.02s]  No, that's going to take me like all day.
[1653.40s -> 1655.72s]  I actually kind of like the idea of the food group family.
[1655.72s -> 1656.60s]  Where it's like a...
[1656.60s -> 1657.64s]  Well, we already had bread.
[1658.63s -> 1664.71s]  Fats, oils, meats, cheeses, vegetables, fruits.
[1664.71s -> 1666.23s]  Let's see how far I can take this.
[1666.23s -> 1668.58s]  And then I'm going to move on.
[1668.58s -> 1669.94s]  Welcome to the rest of the streams.
[1669.94s -> 1670.50s]  I'm serious.
[1671.06s -> 1675.69s]  All right, we need like a different color.
[1676.25s -> 1677.34s]  Here we go.
[1677.34s -> 1683.72s]  It looks better.
[1683.72s -> 1688.82s]  All right, there's Pauline pear fruit.
[1688.82s -> 1689.78s]  Make a hamburger.
[1691.58s -> 1695.83s]  All right, personality traits.
[1695.83s -> 1696.31s]  Let's see.
[1697.43s -> 1700.86s]  Food, master chef.
[1700.86s -> 1701.98s]  They all have to be chefs.
[1706.89s -> 1710.09s]  Hot-headed, self-assured, goofball, creative, active.
[1710.89s -> 1712.06s]  Because it's a pear.
[1713.50s -> 1713.98s]  Let's see here.
[1713.98s -> 1722.49s]  We got art lover, foodie, ambitious, clumsy.
[1723.45s -> 1725.69s]  This is all about what a pear would be.
[1729.86s -> 1730.74s]  Childish maybe?
[1730.74s -> 1730.98s]  No.
[1731.70s -> 1735.06s]  Probably pretty neat.
[1735.06s -> 1738.74s]  Vegetarian, snob.
[1739.38s -> 1740.14s]  Hold on.
[1740.14s -> 1741.10s]  Let's look at the other categories.
[1741.10s -> 1744.95s]  Broke, lover, mean, noncommittal, loner.
[1750.07s -> 1750.63s]  Vegetarian.
[1751.27s -> 1756.49s]  That's pretty terrible considering.
[1761.03s -> 1761.19s]  Just...
[1762.36s -> 1762.68s]  Okay.
[1763.56s -> 1765.10s]  That's actually kind of scary.
[1765.10s -> 1765.82s]  All right, we're good.
[1765.82s -> 1766.46s]  Pauline pear.
[1767.02s -> 1769.91s]  It's the fruit family coming up next.
[1770.95s -> 1771.35s]  We have...
[1773.96s -> 1778.14s]  All right, is it going to be berry, blueberry?
[1784.74s -> 1785.46s]  Berry banana?
[1789.69s -> 1790.95s]  All right, that looks good.
[1791.67s -> 1792.71s]  Default walk style.
[1793.83s -> 1794.87s]  Berry banana.
[1795.67s -> 1798.23s]  I'm not going to make the annoying orange.
[1800.04s -> 1801.24s]  Banana would be pretty confident.
[1804.04s -> 1805.40s]  Roommates with Pauline pear.
[1811.93s -> 1812.25s]  Sweet.
[1819.21s -> 1819.77s]  Okay, that's good.
[1820.89s -> 1821.77s]  Benedict banana.
[1822.65s -> 1824.15s]  Benedict.
[1824.95s -> 1825.43s]  Banana.
[1826.07s -> 1826.87s]  I can't fit it.
[1827.51s -> 1828.81s]  How about Ben banana?
[1829.45s -> 1836.52s]  Ben banana fruit.
[1837.99s -> 1838.63s]  Last name.
[1839.59s -> 1840.39s]  Oh, that's right.
[1840.39s -> 1841.51s]  Ben banana.
[1844.97s -> 1845.45s]  But don't...
[1845.45s -> 1846.81s]  Oh no, they can be roommates.
[1846.81s -> 1847.85s]  It's not The Sims 2.
[1848.73s -> 1849.37s]  Benedict.
[1850.78s -> 1851.90s]  Benedict banana.
[1852.54s -> 1860.31s]  I didn't spell that right.
[1860.31s -> 1861.35s]  Ben-edict.
[1864.76s -> 1867.56s]  Make Benedict cucumber?
[1868.44s -> 1869.56s]  And make it a cucumber.
[1869.56s -> 1869.80s]  What?
[1878.95s -> 1880.79s]  No, just have it be Dr. Strange.
[1883.53s -> 1885.13s]  Benedict cucumber patch.
[1889.99s -> 1891.45s]  Just make him green.
[1892.09s -> 1893.13s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[1893.13s -> 1894.01s]  All right, we got to focus.
[1894.01s -> 1894.97s]  Focus on the banana.
[1894.97s -> 1895.77s]  Benedict banana.
[1896.41s -> 1898.87s]  Fuck this already.
[1904.38s -> 1908.33s]  How am I going to do this?
[1909.13s -> 1923.35s]  How am I going to make Benedict banana?
[1925.96s -> 1927.16s]  Is it looking costumes?
[1927.16s -> 1928.92s]  Is there actually like a banana costume?
[1929.48s -> 1931.11s]  Let's see.
[1931.11s -> 1935.80s]  Suit jackets, business swimsuit, vests, full body.
[1937.22s -> 1937.86s]  Costumes.
[1940.57s -> 1941.05s]  Banana.
[1973.67s -> 1975.59s]  First person to die, by the way.
[1975.59s -> 1978.74s]  No, this should be the drug dealer.
[1978.74s -> 1979.22s]  No, all right.
[1979.22s -> 1981.06s]  Focus, focus, focus, focus, focus, focus.
[1994.68s -> 1995.64s]  Take this costume off.
[1998.42s -> 1999.78s]  No banana though, unfortunately.
[1999.78s -> 2000.58s]  But there is a hot dog.
[2000.58s -> 2001.70s]  But what if I make the hot dog?
[2001.70s -> 2003.22s]  Can I color the hot dog?
[2003.78s -> 2011.22s]  Can we just pretend this is a banana?
[2011.22s -> 2013.14s]  I can't make this a different color.
[2016.98s -> 2018.26s]  It's a banana.
[2018.26s -> 2018.58s]  Yes.
[2018.58s -> 2021.62s]  Okay, guys, this is a peeled banana in a bun.
[2021.62s -> 2034.07s]  With mustard on it.
[2034.07s -> 2035.99s]  No, that's just, that's banana puree.
[2035.99s -> 2042.50s]  Okay, can I do anything else with that?
[2049.29s -> 2053.05s]  Okay, let's see if I can make this work for all of us.
[2053.05s -> 2061.74s]  Let's go in closer here.
[2061.74s -> 2077.18s]  Bring it out.
[2077.18s -> 2078.46s]  Bring the face in.
[2078.46s -> 2093.83s]  Okay, really, it's hard to do this with the...
[2094.63s -> 2114.01s]  I need to get in there.
[2114.57s -> 2118.70s]  It's hard to get in there though,
[2118.70s -> 2121.50s]  because its head is so in such a strange place.
[2121.50s -> 2127.16s]  I wish I could move the camera more with a detailed edit,
[2127.16s -> 2128.36s]  because see how it's too big?
[2128.36s -> 2143.11s]  Pull that in.
[2147.38s -> 2148.58s]  Angel fish.
[2148.58s -> 2149.46s]  There we go.
[2149.46s -> 2150.50s]  It's a good start.
[2150.50s -> 2167.18s]  Pull these ears back.
[2167.18s -> 2170.17s]  I really need to get a hold of here.
[2170.17s -> 2171.14s]  I can't.
[2172.94s -> 2184.90s]  I can make his head temporarily smaller.
[2184.90s -> 2185.46s]  Damn it.
[2185.46s -> 2188.23s]  You really don't want to let me grab that, do you?
[2188.23s -> 2205.77s]  Okay, I need to bring these out further.
[2205.77s -> 2207.42s]  Oh, shit.
[2207.42s -> 2208.38s]  There we go.
[2208.38s -> 2227.26s]  I need the back of his head.
[2227.26s -> 2228.70s]  Come on, give me the back of the head.
[2228.70s -> 2234.23s]  We got to kill all the eyebrows and shit.
[2234.23s -> 2235.43s]  No facial hair.
[2235.43s -> 2237.59s]  Get rid of the eyebrows too.
[2237.59s -> 2247.93s]  It's Lex Luthor.
[2247.93s -> 2259.96s]  Not quite.
[2259.96s -> 2261.48s]  I need this to come up.
[2261.48s -> 2267.26s]  I need to get under here and like pull that up.
[2267.26s -> 2268.94s]  It's too long.
[2269.50s -> 2272.22s]  See, I can't even grab it.
[2282.07s -> 2283.91s]  Jesus Christ, this is horrifying.
[2283.91s -> 2299.53s]  Okay, I need to get these eyebrows out of here.
[2299.53s -> 2315.38s]  Okay, hair.
[2315.38s -> 2316.50s]  Facial hair.
[2316.50s -> 2317.86s]  Accessories, eyebrows.
[2317.86s -> 2319.14s]  Delete eyebrows.
[2319.14s -> 2332.55s]  Okay, there we go.
[2332.55s -> 2333.67s]  I can't get rid of them.
[2333.67s -> 2337.08s]  Yeah, yeah, I can.
[2337.08s -> 2345.37s]  Oh, this sucks.
[2345.37s -> 2346.33s]  This sucks.
[2346.33s -> 2349.45s]  Absolute ass.
[2349.45s -> 2350.25s]  Put them back?
[2350.25s -> 2352.09s]  No, I'm not going to put them back.
[2352.09s -> 2353.85s]  I need this skull to come up.
[2353.85s -> 2363.13s]  All right, let's widen it a little more.
[2363.13s -> 2367.50s]  He's ripping through the costume with his banana face.
[2367.58s -> 2374.84s]  Let's see if I can pull this middle back one more time.
[2374.84s -> 2375.64s]  Okay, I can.
[2375.64s -> 2384.39s]  There we go.
[2384.39s -> 2393.22s]  That's good.
[2393.22s -> 2395.93s]  I'm looking.
[2395.93s -> 2397.61s]  I need that on this side.
[2399.05s -> 2402.07s]  How do I get that little tilt there?
[2402.07s -> 2411.74s]  Come on, give me that tilt right here.
[2411.74s -> 2417.14s]  Let me see his mouth.
[2417.78s -> 2425.96s]  No, that's too fucked up.
[2425.96s -> 2428.52s]  We can't go totally fucked up.
[2428.52s -> 2430.82s]  He has to at least kind of look like a person.
[2436.44s -> 2437.56s]  That's pretty banana-like.
[2437.56s -> 2438.36s]  It is.
[2438.36s -> 2438.92s]  All right, all right.
[2438.92s -> 2440.52s]  Now we need a hat.
[2440.52s -> 2446.38s]  The nose is a little too extreme.
[2447.02s -> 2447.82s]  I agree.
[2447.82s -> 2456.52s]  Now we just need a pointy hat.
[2456.52s -> 2462.54s]  Let's see.
[2462.54s -> 2463.34s]  Let's see if we can get it.
[2463.34s -> 2468.30s]  Any like goofy funny hats?
[2468.30s -> 2470.66s]  Kind of, but I can't.
[2470.66s -> 2476.44s]  No, that doesn't work.
[2476.44s -> 2477.48s]  That doesn't work.
[2477.48s -> 2483.45s]  This is not even going to fit on his face.
[2483.45s -> 2484.09s]  Yes, it does.
[2488.02s -> 2489.86s]  Yeah, why can't you have Darth Vader?
[2492.92s -> 2493.96s]  Please be yellow.
[2493.96s -> 2495.00s]  Oh, come on.
[2497.37s -> 2500.94s]  That is as good as it's going to get.
[2500.94s -> 2504.78s]  That is a banana in a bun with some hot dogs.
[2505.82s -> 2506.84s]  That was perfect.
[2516.10s -> 2517.94s]  Even more like a hot dog.
[2519.62s -> 2523.80s]  It's not a hot dog.
[2523.80s -> 2524.52s]  It's a banana.
[2524.52s -> 2526.50s]  It's a peeled banana.
[2526.50s -> 2528.18s]  You got to go with what you can work with here.
[2529.64s -> 2530.92s]  I can't make a banana.
[2532.94s -> 2534.46s]  It's not a tofu dog.
[2534.46s -> 2539.06s]  It's a banana.
[2539.06s -> 2539.86s]  Hold on.
[2539.86s -> 2549.02s]  Can I give him a jacket or something so I can cover this up?
[2549.02s -> 2550.22s]  No, no, no.
[2550.22s -> 2550.94s]  It has to be this.
[2551.93s -> 2552.25s]  Tops.
[2552.25s -> 2553.45s]  Can I throw something else on top?
[2554.90s -> 2556.12s]  No.
[2556.12s -> 2559.27s]  God damn it.
[2559.27s -> 2559.77s]  Shit.
[2567.86s -> 2568.74s]  Yellow tux.
[2568.74s -> 2569.78s]  No, but it doesn't work.
[2573.29s -> 2574.81s]  I can't do a yellow tux.
[2580.73s -> 2582.82s]  Okay, it kind of does work.
[2582.82s -> 2583.46s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[2595.82s -> 2597.34s]  It looks like a mustard dispenser.
[2598.28s -> 2599.00s]  Hold on.
[2599.00s -> 2606.65s]  He's just like a regular guy in a suit but just happens to also be a banana.
[2608.22s -> 2608.94s]  That's not bad.
[2619.54s -> 2620.98s]  Just do a filter for yellow.
[2623.74s -> 2625.66s]  Let's get, oh, let me get, let me get out a full body.
[2626.30s -> 2638.01s]  I actually kind of liked, oh, look at this one.
[2641.05s -> 2649.93s]  I like the idea of he's just a regular guy but really, really, really took on that banana persona
[2649.93s -> 2656.36s]  and is just killing it.
[2656.36s -> 2660.44s]  Plus, make sure we pick stuff that they're wearing that it's easy enough for me to replicate
[2660.44s -> 2663.08s]  when these assholes inevitably end up in the next rumble.
[2670.07s -> 2670.87s]  Hold on.
[2670.87s -> 2674.68s]  I said that's too yellow.
[2674.68s -> 2675.40s]  That is mustard.
[2675.40s -> 2676.44s]  This is banana.
[2676.44s -> 2684.36s]  Let's see, what do we get for bottoms?
[2690.42s -> 2691.54s]  Oh no, you're right.
[2693.35s -> 2693.75s]  You're right.
[2694.87s -> 2698.87s]  We got to make some very, very minor changes here because this is just like dickhead man.
[2705.13s -> 2706.33s]  This is just penis guy.
[2706.33s -> 2707.37s]  This is not even a banana.
[2707.37s -> 2708.49s]  Okay, I got to fix this.
[2710.92s -> 2712.28s]  A banana just is a dick.
[2713.24s -> 2717.38s]  If you think about it, how do I fix this?
[2717.94s -> 2725.11s]  I'm talking like I'm going to create a character.
[2726.63s -> 2733.50s]  I'm making a peeled banana and it's this, a peeled banana is this kind of like fleshy color.
[2746.30s -> 2749.10s]  Just make it yellow.
[2749.10s -> 2749.66s]  I can't.
[2753.24s -> 2759.24s]  All right, he's just, he's just going in a regular, he's going in regular clothes.
[2759.24s -> 2760.44s]  Take off the hot dog head.
[2761.48s -> 2766.97s]  That makes it so much better because that is, he is a banana.
[2766.97s -> 2769.42s]  He's just a guy with a big chin here.
[2769.42s -> 2779.08s]  No, that has to stay.
[2779.08s -> 2779.80s]  All right, let's go.
[2780.54s -> 2782.58s]  Time to complete this guy.
[2782.58s -> 2785.30s]  I'm going to put him in, what was that suit I had before?
[2785.30s -> 2798.78s]  No, no.
[2798.78s -> 2800.94s]  He's unfriendly and scary.
[2800.94s -> 2801.66s]  How do you know that?
[2810.97s -> 2812.33s]  Just make him a real person.
[2812.89s -> 2816.14s]  What is that?
[2816.94s -> 2820.34s]  What?
[2820.34s -> 2827.72s]  Oh, there it is.
[2828.28s -> 2833.59s]  Why did his chin get smaller?
[2842.65s -> 2843.21s]  Excuse me.
[2846.22s -> 2847.98s]  What happened to his, what happened to him?
[2847.98s -> 2854.39s]  He lost all of his charm, his eyes.
[2862.04s -> 2862.76s]  That's okay.
[2862.76s -> 2865.00s]  That's actually pretty good because it's not as extreme.
[2865.00s -> 2865.72s]  I don't hate this.
[2878.63s -> 2879.83s]  The outfit fucked it up.
[2879.83s -> 2884.10s]  All right, looks good.
[2884.10s -> 2885.30s]  This is Benedict Banana.
[2885.30s -> 2898.20s]  Gonna change the bottom here.
[2898.20s -> 2899.24s]  No, he's not gonna be jacked.
[2899.24s -> 2903.86s]  He's gonna be skinny.
[2903.86s -> 2905.70s]  Hot dog hat and the yellow raincoat.
[2905.70s -> 2907.54s]  Should I just take the hot dog hat off?
[2907.54s -> 2908.66s]  Is it technically still on?
[2911.83s -> 2912.95s]  Yeah, it's technically still on.
[2913.51s -> 2915.82s]  Nah, it doesn't change anything.
[2929.82s -> 2930.94s]  It's perfect.
[2930.94s -> 2932.22s]  It's perfect.
[2932.22s -> 2952.70s]  All right, we need to 100% perfect.
[2952.70s -> 2953.66s]  That's the banana.
[2953.66s -> 2954.14s]  Peel.
[2954.14s -> 2955.10s]  He's peeled back.
[2955.10s -> 2963.37s]  All right, let's see what I'm gonna do for pants here.
[2963.37s -> 2964.89s]  Whoa, hey, hey, hey.
[2966.73s -> 2967.45s]  What?
[2967.45s -> 2974.12s]  Oh, because this is full body.
[2974.12s -> 2977.64s]  We can't change the pants.
[2977.64s -> 2978.36s]  Oh, what the fuck?
[2978.36s -> 2979.24s]  What happened to that?
[2979.24s -> 2983.54s]  That's kind of dumb.
[2983.54s -> 2992.60s]  Well, that's the way it's gonna be.
[2992.60s -> 2996.22s]  There's Benedict Banana for you.
[2996.22s -> 2998.06s]  And this is every day.
[3000.62s -> 3001.82s]  Yellow rain.
[3001.82s -> 3003.98s]  Dude, the shoes, the yellow rain boots.
[3012.07s -> 3013.51s]  I don't even know if they have that shit.
[3013.51s -> 3014.23s]  Boots here.
[3023.37s -> 3024.89s]  So what's going on here then?
[3024.89s -> 3030.78s]  All right, that looks good.
[3030.78s -> 3033.46s]  Benedict Banana.
[3033.46s -> 3035.38s]  Banana's a potassium, right?
[3043.27s -> 3047.48s]  Chef.
[3047.48s -> 3047.96s]  Genius.
[3048.68s -> 3049.72s]  It's a brain power food.
[3052.46s -> 3053.26s]  No, it helped.
[3053.26s -> 3055.22s]  It's got plenty of vitamins in it.
[3055.30s -> 3055.70s]  Cheerful.
[3060.15s -> 3061.59s]  I would say childish as well.
[3061.59s -> 3062.95s]  Lots of kids eat bananas.
[3069.42s -> 3072.86s]  It's in every lunchbox in America.
[3072.86s -> 3073.26s]  Clumsy.
[3073.26s -> 3074.46s]  Why would a banana be clumsy?
[3078.94s -> 3079.50s]  Clumsy.
[3080.06s -> 3082.52s]  How would a banana be clumsy?
[3084.47s -> 3085.67s]  All right, got Benedict Banana.
[3085.67s -> 3086.79s]  I gotta change.
[3086.79s -> 3087.59s]  Okay, so you're done.
[3088.31s -> 3092.62s]  I gotta change your name to Pauline Pear
[3092.62s -> 3096.14s]  and not have it be the Pauline Pear.
[3097.54s -> 3100.42s]  Oh, it's because it was a banana.
[3100.42s -> 3100.90s]  I get it.
[3101.54s -> 3104.38s]  Pauline Pear.
[3104.38s -> 3106.10s]  All right, we're gonna make...
[3107.98s -> 3113.42s]  Let's make Apple Andy.
[3114.06s -> 3114.70s]  How's that sound?
[3122.57s -> 3123.29s]  Apple Andy.
[3128.12s -> 3128.76s]  All right, let's see.
[3128.76s -> 3129.80s]  How am I gonna do Apple?
[3135.26s -> 3136.22s]  Adam Apple.
[3136.22s -> 3137.82s]  And just have him have a huge neck,
[3137.82s -> 3140.46s]  like a big fucking bump on the front of his neck.
[3141.51s -> 3142.71s]  Let me see if I can do that first
[3142.71s -> 3143.99s]  and then we'll go from there.
[3143.99s -> 3147.85s]  I don't think I can do that.
[3148.41s -> 3154.89s]  All right, we need to get the first things first.
[3155.45s -> 3166.87s]  You should add a baby
[3166.87s -> 3168.63s]  so you can have like a baby carrot.
[3168.63s -> 3171.74s]  No, no, I'm not going to add a baby
[3171.74s -> 3174.54s]  considering the in-fucking-sane mods
[3174.54s -> 3175.26s]  that are in this game.
[3177.64s -> 3178.84s]  That's not gonna happen.
[3178.84s -> 3180.28s]  That would be the worst mistake
[3180.28s -> 3181.16s]  I probably could ever make.
[3181.96s -> 3183.40s]  I'm telling you right now,
[3183.40s -> 3185.88s]  trust me when I say no baby.
[3187.05s -> 3196.42s]  No, no, no, no.
[3196.42s -> 3196.92s]  Boo.
[3197.70s -> 3200.63s]  All right, we gotta have a huge head.
[3204.31s -> 3205.03s]  There's an apple.
[3205.67s -> 3206.95s]  That might be too big.
[3207.43s -> 3210.12s]  All right, get rid of the hair.
[3210.12s -> 3216.62s]  Let's go with no eyebrows.
[3216.62s -> 3217.66s]  None of them should have eyebrows.
[3217.66s -> 3218.46s]  Fuck the eyebrows.
[3219.10s -> 3219.82s]  They're fruits.
[3220.38s -> 3224.28s]  All right, what does an apple look like?
[3226.22s -> 3227.18s]  It's square, right?
[3227.82s -> 3232.12s]  I mean, it's...
[3237.19s -> 3240.94s]  First of all, no, I'm fucking kidding.
[3240.94s -> 3245.42s]  Do you even have a face?
[3250.74s -> 3252.34s]  No, how big should the nose be?
[3254.20s -> 3257.48s]  Nothing extreme because that's just like dumb.
[3258.54s -> 3260.70s]  I can go absurd with this shit.
[3260.70s -> 3273.51s]  What is like the...
[3273.51s -> 3278.39s]  Hold on, where did I get the...
[3279.93s -> 3280.89s]  I know I can tilt.
[3292.86s -> 3294.62s]  Where's the thing to pull it down?
[3295.42s -> 3296.70s]  I just want to show you this
[3297.50s -> 3298.94s]  because it's fucking crazy.
[3301.59s -> 3303.35s]  If I can get it to catch on it,
[3303.35s -> 3307.46s]  you'll see just how stupid this is.
[3316.82s -> 3317.54s]  That's nothing.
[3317.54s -> 3319.62s]  If I can get the camera in the right place,
[3321.03s -> 3323.11s]  you can actually do some stupid shit.
[3324.09s -> 3325.21s]  Somebody has to be a dinosaur.
[3339.40s -> 3340.28s]  Damn it, come on.
[3340.84s -> 3343.30s]  It's just so hard to grab.
[3345.24s -> 3348.76s]  Is there a way that I can make it do like tilt or stretch?
[3348.84s -> 3351.16s]  Or do I have to have it be in the exact spot?
[3351.80s -> 3353.96s]  Is there a certain combination of buttons I can do?
[3361.21s -> 3365.16s]  Hold shift, detail edit,
[3365.16s -> 3367.64s]  because yes, I'm trying to get the little tilt thing
[3373.85s -> 3376.57s]  because I can pull this all the way down to the ground if I want.
[3376.57s -> 3381.06s]  I'm certain of it.
[3389.46s -> 3391.62s]  I got to get like the combination to do it.
[3391.62s -> 3392.74s]  So it's crazy.
[3395.96s -> 3397.48s]  Make the nose small first.
[3400.50s -> 3403.61s]  All right, there, not that one.
[3404.33s -> 3405.05s]  All right, right here.
[3406.12s -> 3406.76s]  That's what I'm looking for.
[3406.76s -> 3407.56s]  I want that on the nose.
[3416.10s -> 3417.86s]  Come on, let me see it.
[3419.72s -> 3422.28s]  I'm just, I'm just making Michael Cera.
[3432.68s -> 3433.80s]  Come on, do it.
[3434.73s -> 3435.45s]  Just do it.
[3441.75s -> 3442.15s]  No.
[3445.69s -> 3446.89s]  Oh, whatever.
[3446.89s -> 3466.68s]  Make it normal.
[3466.68s -> 3473.61s]  This is supposed to be an apple, right?
[3474.17s -> 3482.41s]  Yeah, pull the bridge out.
[3482.41s -> 3483.45s]  It's too deep.
[3483.45s -> 3499.40s]  It needs to be way fatter than this.
[3508.76s -> 3509.80s]  That's not a bad head shape.
[3509.80s -> 3511.32s]  When I said square, what I'm talking about is,
[3511.32s -> 3515.29s]  you know how an apple has sort of the beefy buff chest
[3515.29s -> 3516.57s]  and then comes down a little bit?
[3532.87s -> 3534.07s]  Some of you guys know what I'm talking about.
[3534.07s -> 3538.90s]  It's fine.
[3539.46s -> 3542.82s]  Any bigger than that.
[3542.82s -> 3544.02s]  That looks good.
[3544.02s -> 3550.49s]  Okay, look, maybe the head a little bit bigger.
[3550.49s -> 3552.70s]  Look at that.
[3552.70s -> 3554.44s]  Perfect apple.
[3554.44s -> 3555.00s]  It just is.
[3555.56s -> 3558.18s]  I want to make the head wider, but I don't think I can.
[3558.18s -> 3558.66s]  That's all right.
[3558.66s -> 3559.14s]  It looks good.
[3559.78s -> 3563.98s]  Oh, Jojo, right?
[3563.98s -> 3564.86s]  The Jojo song.
[3565.50s -> 3567.30s]  I don't know why I just did that.
[3567.30s -> 3575.19s]  That's all I could just hear right there.
[3576.86s -> 3580.76s]  That like, I don't even know what it is.
[3588.94s -> 3589.42s]  What does it say?
[3589.42s -> 3595.56s]  It goes like, the torture dance, right?
[3598.09s -> 3599.61s]  That don't ask me why the fuck I just did that,
[3599.61s -> 3600.57s]  but hey, there it is.
[3604.49s -> 3606.33s]  Vocal percussion on a whole nother level.
[3606.33s -> 3606.73s]  There it is.
[3607.37s -> 3608.73s]  For those of you that are watching,
[3608.73s -> 3609.69s]  I've never seen that show.
[3611.51s -> 3612.31s]  I don't know what it is.
[3612.95s -> 3622.82s]  And we want like a big happy family for the apple.
[3630.36s -> 3630.68s]  Love?
[3631.48s -> 3631.88s]  Nature?
[3636.97s -> 3637.29s]  No.
[3637.29s -> 3638.49s]  Apples want like a big huge...
[3638.49s -> 3639.53s]  Look, that's an apple tree.
[3640.62s -> 3641.42s]  Very, very clear.
[3647.05s -> 3647.85s]  Self-assured.
[3647.85s -> 3648.81s]  They're kind of assholes.
[3648.81s -> 3650.17s]  They think they're the best fruit in the bunch.
[3651.05s -> 3655.80s]  No, he's not done.
[3655.80s -> 3657.08s]  I just want to get this out of the way first.
[3667.64s -> 3668.92s]  Love the halfway half of this.
[3670.09s -> 3671.13s]  Oh, we didn't get to see it.
[3674.63s -> 3675.43s]  That's sicko.
[3676.47s -> 3677.43s]  You're fucked up.
[3679.85s -> 3680.17s]  Okay.
[3682.02s -> 3682.74s]  How does this sound?
[3701.40s -> 3702.28s]  That's perfect for me.
[3704.04s -> 3705.08s]  All right, we're gonna add hair.
[3705.72s -> 3709.22s]  I mean, just stem.
[3712.68s -> 3713.32s]  That's not gonna work.
[3713.32s -> 3716.04s]  That's way too frayed out to be a stem.
[3716.04s -> 3720.10s]  Is there a single ponytail I can put up?
[3720.10s -> 3721.53s]  What about the bun?
[3722.09s -> 3727.50s]  That's pretty close.
[3727.50s -> 3728.06s]  So is that.
[3732.28s -> 3732.92s]  Oh, God.
[3733.56s -> 3735.51s]  But that could be a tomato.
[3735.51s -> 3737.43s]  That's not even a fucking apple.
[3737.99s -> 3743.35s]  It doesn't need to be brown.
[3743.91s -> 3747.67s]  What about this one?
[3747.67s -> 3749.11s]  This one's a little smaller.
[3749.11s -> 3755.38s]  I think that's as close as it's gonna be.
[3756.66s -> 3763.26s]  All right, what about clothes?
[3765.30s -> 3766.34s]  Tomato is a fruit.
[3766.90s -> 3771.62s]  Should he just have no clothes on at all?
[3771.62s -> 3773.14s]  I feel like an apple wouldn't have any clothes on.
[3776.89s -> 3777.85s]  Apple's very basic.
[3778.41s -> 3779.37s]  Doesn't need anything.
[3788.14s -> 3789.58s]  You don't add stuff to apples.
[3790.22s -> 3790.78s]  You just eat it.
[3791.34s -> 3793.10s]  At least make the underwear red.
[3793.10s -> 3794.06s]  Yeah, I'll try.
[3794.62s -> 3798.49s]  What do you got right now?
[3798.49s -> 3799.53s]  Can I make it red?
[3799.53s -> 3800.41s]  I can.
[3800.41s -> 3803.70s]  All right, there's Apple Andy.
[3805.11s -> 3806.55s]  Actually, it should be Andy Apple.
[3808.14s -> 3809.26s]  Last name is gonna be the fruit.
[3818.01s -> 3819.69s]  Change this into a formal outfit.
[3820.25s -> 3821.45s]  This is everyday.
[3821.45s -> 3821.95s]  Formal.
[3824.86s -> 3826.22s]  No, I'm keeping that.
[3826.22s -> 3827.54s]  I'm not taking this off.
[3828.18s -> 3835.91s]  Why would I take that off?
[3838.46s -> 3840.06s]  Who's next in this shit show?
[3844.68s -> 3846.04s]  We're gonna go with five.
[3846.84s -> 3848.57s]  What's left?
[3848.57s -> 3853.19s]  Apple, pear, banana, apple, blueberry.
[3853.19s -> 3864.02s]  Do we already have a berry?
[3864.02s -> 3865.06s]  Is it berry banana?
[3865.62s -> 3867.16s]  No, it's Benedict banana.
[3867.16s -> 3872.49s]  Okay, okay.
[3877.75s -> 3879.03s]  The candy one that sounds better.
[3879.75s -> 3885.32s]  Wait, wouldn't blueberry...
[3885.32s -> 3886.68s]  No, blueberry would have a tiny head.
[3887.24s -> 3887.96s]  Not a big one.
[3888.52s -> 3892.07s]  Wouldn't a blueberry be little...
[3892.63s -> 3898.52s]  Did you just say blueberry Andy?
[3899.08s -> 3902.57s]  Why would I make this guy's name blueberry Andy?
[3907.51s -> 3908.23s]  I do that.
[3908.87s -> 3916.73s]  Okay, let's detail this up.
[3919.42s -> 3921.42s]  I think the chin, everything has to come up.
[3921.42s -> 3921.82s]  Everything.
[3922.90s -> 3925.35s]  Small, condensed.
[3925.91s -> 3940.57s]  I'm losing his neck here.
[3940.57s -> 3947.62s]  Let's make you...
[3949.02s -> 3949.26s]  What?
[3949.82s -> 3950.70s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[3950.70s -> 3955.59s]  Yeah, yeah.
[3955.59s -> 3956.87s]  Smaller head or right.
[3956.87s -> 3958.55s]  I can't make it that much smaller.
[3959.54s -> 3961.14s]  That's as small as I can make it.
[3968.79s -> 3969.75s]  Without distorting.
[3969.75s -> 3972.31s]  I mean, why is it that long?
[3978.84s -> 3981.40s]  Okay, that looks not bad at all actually.
[3981.40s -> 3984.95s]  Let me just go in here.
[3984.95s -> 4030.66s]  Do the eyebrows.
[4030.66s -> 4036.23s]  Should the blueberry just have eyebrows?
[4036.23s -> 4045.99s]  Why would that happen?
[4045.99s -> 4062.97s]  I don't know why the blueberry has big ears.
[4062.97s -> 4063.69s]  Nice.
[4063.69s -> 4064.49s]  Looking good.
[4064.49s -> 4085.10s]  Hold on.
[4085.10s -> 4086.14s]  I gotta fix that.
[4086.78s -> 4105.42s]  Eyes gotta be a little smaller.
[4105.42s -> 4114.50s]  They're taking up too much space.
[4114.50s -> 4115.70s]  Holy fuck.
[4115.70s -> 4118.52s]  He looks like he's in pain.
[4118.52s -> 4130.82s]  I gotta bring this in.
[4131.82s -> 4132.14s]  In.
[4133.38s -> 4134.02s]  Come in.
[4134.58s -> 4139.45s]  You look like a guy wearing a slipknot mask.
[4139.45s -> 4175.11s]  Okay, I want to bring this up and pull this back.
[4175.11s -> 4180.09s]  Oh no, I think I broke it.
[4180.09s -> 4180.65s]  No, I didn't.
[4180.65s -> 4181.05s]  We're good.
[4190.28s -> 4199.34s]  This is Gonzo from The Muppets is who this is turning into.
[4199.34s -> 4200.46s]  All right, back to normal.
[4200.46s -> 4206.25s]  I think my hands are up right now.
[4206.25s -> 4219.30s]  How big?
[4219.30s -> 4221.64s]  I need to make you a little bit smaller.
[4221.64s -> 4227.32s]  Okay, let's go.
[4227.88s -> 4231.14s]  No, this is fine.
[4231.14s -> 4232.42s]  Berry blueberry is done.
[4232.42s -> 4237.98s]  This is just a house of the gushers fruit people.
[4237.98s -> 4242.39s]  Yeah, it kind of is.
[4242.39s -> 4245.02s]  All right, Berry.
[4245.02s -> 4246.22s]  No, he needs clothes.
[4246.22s -> 4264.94s]  Everyone just can't be naked.
[4264.94s -> 4265.74s]  Make him short?
[4265.74s -> 4268.44s]  I can't.
[4268.44s -> 4272.07s]  I can't without making him a child.
[4272.07s -> 4274.71s]  I can't do it and I can't have a child in this game.
[4274.71s -> 4288.55s]  This is guys, this is gonna be like a fucking long ass stream.
[4288.55s -> 4289.19s]  Okay.
[4289.19s -> 4298.36s]  All right, here we go.
[4298.36s -> 4299.24s]  Smaller, small.
[4299.24s -> 4299.88s]  I can't.
[4300.52s -> 4302.20s]  I can't do it.
[4302.20s -> 4303.24s]  It's gonna fuck it all up.
[4303.24s -> 4304.28s]  If I go down to...
[4304.28s -> 4308.02s]  No, his whole head is...
[4308.02s -> 4309.06s]  Everything's gonna be fucked up.
[4309.06s -> 4310.74s]  All of his head is gonna be misshaped.
[4310.74s -> 4312.42s]  I'm gonna have to do it all over again.
[4312.42s -> 4316.28s]  No, do you see how long this took?
[4316.84s -> 4319.16s]  I'm not making Berry blueberry again.
[4319.16s -> 4329.11s]  The undo button with control Z.
[4329.11s -> 4330.87s]  If this fucks it up, I'm gonna scream.
[4330.87s -> 4345.85s]  Okay, it works.
[4345.85s -> 4347.90s]  Do you understand?
[4347.90s -> 4349.26s]  Teen didn't do anything.
[4349.26s -> 4350.78s]  See?
[4350.78s -> 4351.98s]  Young adult didn't do anything.
[4353.21s -> 4354.89s]  You have to make them a child.
[4358.41s -> 4359.05s]  No, no, no.
[4359.05s -> 4359.61s]  How far?
[4359.61s -> 4360.57s]  Thank God.
[4360.57s -> 4364.76s]  Do you understand why this cannot be in the game?
[4372.33s -> 4374.79s]  Nope, I'm sorry.
[4374.79s -> 4377.27s]  I gotta stand on my moral soapbox here.
[4381.72s -> 4382.28s]  Old man.
[4385.93s -> 4395.26s]  No, I'm gonna keep the way it was.
[4395.26s -> 4396.30s]  You have to make a prune.
[4397.10s -> 4397.90s]  All right, let's get through.
[4397.90s -> 4398.94s]  We got Berry blueberry.
[4398.94s -> 4400.94s]  Let's get the aspirations.
[4401.58s -> 4403.66s]  It's a brain food.
[4405.11s -> 4405.83s]  Nerd brain.
[4408.15s -> 4409.91s]  Blueberries are a little on the...
[4409.91s -> 4411.11s]  They're blue, right?
[4421.83s -> 4422.33s]  Childish.
[4423.29s -> 4423.79s]  Hmm.
[4432.06s -> 4432.78s]  Berry blueberry.
[4432.78s -> 4433.18s]  There you go.
[4433.18s -> 4433.68s]  Okay.
[4434.14s -> 4435.36s]  Now we need another one.
[4437.58s -> 4438.14s]  All right.
[4438.14s -> 4440.46s]  I'm kind of sick of the fruit theme at this point.
[4441.02s -> 4442.78s]  This is one house.
[4442.78s -> 4443.74s]  One apartment.
[4443.74s -> 4448.25s]  So we've got pear, apple...
[4448.25s -> 4462.91s]  Pear, banana, apple, blueberry, grape, baby carrot, or riot.
[4462.91s -> 4463.41s]  No.
[4466.89s -> 4467.61s]  I ain't gonna have...
[4467.61s -> 4468.73s]  I ain't gonna be the guy that...
[4470.19s -> 4470.69s]  No.
[4470.69s -> 4471.19s]  Uh-uh.
[4474.48s -> 4475.44s]  Grandpa lemon?
[4475.92s -> 4479.50s]  Let me see.
[4479.50s -> 4480.62s]  Let me see what I can do here.
[4482.96s -> 4483.36s]  We could do...
[4484.32s -> 4485.76s]  What else is green?
[4487.10s -> 4488.78s]  Like a lettuce?
[4489.96s -> 4490.92s]  Larry lettuce?
[4491.56s -> 4492.57s]  Is that gonna work?
[4497.52s -> 4498.32s]  Lenny lettuce.
[4500.75s -> 4501.71s]  Grandpa lime.
[4507.16s -> 4508.12s]  Lemon, lemon, lemon.
[4508.12s -> 4511.48s]  We don't have like a pure yellow, yellow, yellow.
[4511.48s -> 4514.54s]  A kiwi?
[4514.54s -> 4518.35s]  Yeah, but that kind of like grandpa lettuce.
[4518.91s -> 4520.11s]  Can I make a piece of lettuce?
[4520.11s -> 4520.91s]  Let's see.
[4520.91s -> 4521.39s]  What would...
[4521.39s -> 4522.27s]  What would lettuce be?
[4522.91s -> 4527.52s]  But that's not a fruit though.
[4529.15s -> 4532.04s]  We'll do a lime.
[4532.04s -> 4533.08s]  Or a raisin.
[4533.08s -> 4534.36s]  Let's see what we get.
[4534.36s -> 4539.95s]  Let's go in here.
[4548.43s -> 4549.31s]  Hmm.
[4549.31s -> 4550.52s]  I actually like it already.
[4552.89s -> 4554.57s]  Just a big head for a raisin.
[4561.40s -> 4561.80s]  I'm done.
[4569.52s -> 4571.79s]  I'm not gonna do any more...
[4571.79s -> 4572.19s]  This is it.
[4585.88s -> 4586.84s]  Fix the shoes?
[4590.17s -> 4592.17s]  What's wrong with the Donald Duck shoes?
[4603.12s -> 4603.92s]  It's a prune.
[4609.58s -> 4611.02s]  Grandpa prune.
[4611.02s -> 4619.39s]  All right.
[4619.39s -> 4620.83s]  I gotta change the nose a little bit though.
[4620.83s -> 4621.15s]  If he's...
[4621.15s -> 4624.51s]  If it's grandpa, grandpa has to have like a really bulbous, fucked up nose.
[4625.15s -> 4649.12s]  If it is a grandpa, how's that?
[4649.12s -> 4650.16s]  Not too crazy.
[4650.16s -> 4650.64s]  Just enough.
[4661.21s -> 4672.33s]  I have to keep it.
[4672.33s -> 4673.05s]  Jesus Christ.
[4673.05s -> 4674.65s]  I can't even select anything.
[4674.65s -> 4686.16s]  A little on the buggy side.
[4686.16s -> 4687.74s]  It's old.
[4687.74s -> 4689.02s]  Not that much though.
[4689.02s -> 4699.16s]  All right.
[4699.16s -> 4701.48s]  Can I get rid of the Wolverine sideburns?
[4701.48s -> 4710.20s]  Oh God.
[4710.20s -> 4710.92s]  It's like broken.
[4711.48s -> 4718.16s]  A little bit more.
[4718.16s -> 4719.52s]  That's gotta be bulbed.
[4719.52s -> 4751.18s]  I need that now.
[4751.18s -> 4752.86s]  What the front?
[4752.86s -> 4759.68s]  There we go.
[4759.68s -> 4760.24s]  That's better.
[4760.24s -> 4761.12s]  Okay, good.
[4761.12s -> 4765.96s]  I need the eyes to be spread out a little more than that.
[4778.80s -> 4782.52s]  Bring him up.
[4782.52s -> 4783.96s]  No, that's too too clipped.
[4783.96s -> 4784.60s]  Too much clipping.
[4790.96s -> 4791.68s]  Okay, I'm good with that.
[4797.47s -> 4798.35s]  There they are.
[4798.35s -> 4801.37s]  You just made the old guy from up?
[4801.37s -> 4802.49s]  Yeah, I did.
[4802.49s -> 4803.77s]  Now I'm gonna leave it like that.
[4804.51s -> 4805.47s]  Except for the sideburns.
[4805.47s -> 4806.43s]  They look just stupid.
[4808.46s -> 4809.10s]  Now I miss them.
[4809.98s -> 4810.54s]  Shit.
[4810.54s -> 4822.40s]  I miss those sideburns now.
[4822.40s -> 4823.52s]  Bustache maybe?
[4823.52s -> 4844.20s]  Somebody's gotta have a beard, right?
[4844.20s -> 4844.68s]  No, I don't...
[4844.68s -> 4845.88s]  The Wolverine looks just...
[4845.88s -> 4853.24s]  It doesn't look good.
[4853.24s -> 4854.20s]  That one's fine.
[4854.20s -> 4864.22s]  Now I don't like this one because it takes away from his face.
[4875.92s -> 4877.20s]  Bring the shoulders in.
[4889.40s -> 4890.52s]  Get the ass a little bit bigger.
[4896.44s -> 4901.88s]  Prunes aren't blue.
[4901.88s -> 4903.24s]  Yeah, well, I can't...
[4903.24s -> 4906.48s]  I can't make anybody like purple.
[4906.48s -> 4909.10s]  All I can do is give them...
[4909.10s -> 4920.52s]  Look, I gave them the correct hair color.
[4920.52s -> 4930.20s]  Make them more wrinkly.
[4930.20s -> 4936.41s]  Okay, let's get the name here.
[4936.41s -> 4945.21s]  Do I just make them green and just call them like a kiwi or something?
[4949.95s -> 4950.19s]  I can't...
[4950.19s -> 4950.83s]  I want the...
[4950.83s -> 4952.03s]  I'm gonna keep the eyebrows, I think.
[4953.08s -> 4954.36s]  Maybe not because he has facial hair.
[4954.36s -> 4955.48s]  So why wouldn't I keep the eyebrows?
[4972.04s -> 4973.88s]  He does look like a Warcraft gnome.
[4975.88s -> 4976.60s]  It just is.
[4977.16s -> 4977.96s]  Should they be living...
[4977.96s -> 4979.88s]  No, this has to be FRUITS ONLY.
[4980.60s -> 4991.61s]  Just pretend he's a Warcraft gnome.
[4991.61s -> 4992.25s]  Peter Plumb.
[4999.52s -> 5000.56s]  All right, all right, all right.
[5000.56s -> 5003.76s]  We got one, two, three, four, five in the fruit household.
[5003.76s -> 5010.06s]  Let's do some detail work here on the face.
[5013.26s -> 5014.38s]  What the fuck is this?
[5023.84s -> 5028.88s]  It's the creepypasta Plumb with YouTuber hair.
[5034.94s -> 5035.58s]  Put him back.
[5036.60s -> 5037.80s]  What is going on?
[5037.80s -> 5038.84s]  What are these?
[5038.84s -> 5039.80s]  Look at this shit.
[5039.80s -> 5041.96s]  What's with the weird smiling shit?
[5041.96s -> 5046.54s]  I don't know what that means.
[5046.54s -> 5048.22s]  That's just a terrible selfie.
[5048.22s -> 5049.74s]  These are all just bad selfies.
[5051.24s -> 5053.88s]  You go through and you delete these in your phone.
[5053.88s -> 5065.29s]  Okay, more wrinkles.
[5070.00s -> 5070.64s]  These are fate.
[5070.64s -> 5072.08s]  No, this is screwed all up.
[5072.08s -> 5072.88s]  Skin detail.
[5083.66s -> 5084.46s]  Laugh lines.
[5085.02s -> 5086.14s]  I guess you can kind of see them.
[5088.22s -> 5089.34s]  All right, Peter Plumb is ready.
[5090.06s -> 5090.86s]  Different clothes, though.
[5090.86s -> 5091.58s]  These clothes suck.
[5092.14s -> 5114.28s]  Not even purple.
[5114.28s -> 5118.81s]  You don't have purple here?
[5127.44s -> 5128.16s]  That's fine.
[5128.16s -> 5129.52s]  It is a vet shirt, isn't it?
[5129.52s -> 5130.00s]  Why would it...
[5130.00s -> 5134.70s]  Yeah, I'm just realizing this now.
[5134.70s -> 5135.26s]  Better.
[5135.26s -> 5143.36s]  All right, here's the fruit household.
[5143.36s -> 5150.12s]  We've got Pauline Pear, Benedict Banana, Andy Apple, Barry Blueberry, and Peter Plumb.
[5150.12s -> 5152.80s]  It's still a vet.
[5152.80s -> 5153.20s]  That's fine.
[5153.20s -> 5153.60s]  He's a vet.
[5161.20s -> 5162.00s]  Change that shirt.
[5162.00s -> 5162.16s]  No.
[5170.38s -> 5172.62s]  All right, let's move them in and we can make another family.
[5172.62s -> 5173.66s]  I have to make a drug dealer.
[5173.66s -> 5175.50s]  We're going to make the gnome a drug dealer.
[5175.50s -> 5183.52s]  I'm going to make him the only one that's worth the shit in this house.
[5197.00s -> 5199.64s]  Okay, more than five is too much.
[5199.64s -> 5203.16s]  This family is ready to go.
[5203.16s -> 5204.52s]  Let's make sure to double check.
[5204.52s -> 5209.26s]  Pauline Pear, Benedict Banana, there's the apple.
[5209.98s -> 5213.23s]  No, you need to be in your everyday wear.
[5215.37s -> 5219.66s]  This berry, Blueberry, and you got Peter Plumb.
[5220.22s -> 5228.88s]  Okay, name him Ben Anna.
[5229.68s -> 5230.56s]  Blueberry.
[5237.02s -> 5238.14s]  Leopard gnome.
[5238.14s -> 5239.34s]  I can't get over that.
[5239.34s -> 5240.38s]  I'm trying to get over it.
[5240.38s -> 5240.86s]  I can't.
[5246.99s -> 5248.35s]  Peter Plumb is the wrong color.
[5248.99s -> 5249.79s]  It doesn't matter.
[5249.79s -> 5250.43s]  Who cares?
[5250.99s -> 5254.25s]  Is that better?
[5272.08s -> 5273.36s]  Make him just rotten.
[5281.45s -> 5282.49s]  Gray food.
[5292.57s -> 5293.37s]  What color is it?
[5293.37s -> 5293.69s]  Plumb.
[5296.28s -> 5297.40s]  Second row.
[5297.40s -> 5301.05s]  What color is it?
[5301.05s -> 5302.46s]  Plumb.
[5302.46s -> 5303.26s]  Let me see.
[5303.26s -> 5303.82s]  Plumb.
[5309.71s -> 5310.43s]  Purple.
[5310.43s -> 5320.14s]  I think that's, that's actually, that's, I think this is close.
[5320.14s -> 5320.78s]  I'm gonna get it.
[5321.34s -> 5327.61s]  Is that, that's too, can you see?
[5328.17s -> 5335.55s]  Is it purple makeup?
[5335.55s -> 5336.27s]  But there might be.
[5337.76s -> 5338.80s]  Probably not full face though.
[5343.87s -> 5344.51s]  Peter Plumb.
[5345.15s -> 5348.92s]  Look at the color of prune.
[5349.56s -> 5350.52s]  Prune.
[5350.52s -> 5356.57s]  The prunes are like, prunes are raisins.
[5357.13s -> 5362.43s]  Now that's close enough.
[5362.43s -> 5371.02s]  Just go download more colors.
[5380.54s -> 5383.74s]  Is there actually like a, can I actually get a mod that it's,
[5383.74s -> 5385.10s]  yeah, but I'd have to leave the game.
[5385.90s -> 5390.78s]  Prunes are raisins.
[5392.16s -> 5393.36s]  Get the color wheel mod.
[5394.88s -> 5397.04s]  Yeah, you know, it's probably, it's probably simple.
[5399.15s -> 5402.84s]  Can any of the mods give me just a quick link while I finish this up?
[5402.84s -> 5404.84s]  Because I'll get like actual like purple.
[5406.70s -> 5407.34s]  It'll be worth it.
[5407.34s -> 5408.38s]  Yeah, it will.
[5408.38s -> 5409.98s]  We're taking this long to set this up anyways.
[5413.63s -> 5416.91s]  Yeah, most of the mods for The Sims 4 you just drag into the mod folder anyways.
[5427.96s -> 5429.00s]  Let me just close this out.
[5429.00s -> 5430.68s]  I can edit, I can edit the family at any time.
[5430.68s -> 5432.88s]  So this is good to go.
[5432.88s -> 5433.68s]  We'll get that later.
[5434.24s -> 5438.91s]  You have to save the family though to use the mod.
[5438.91s -> 5439.55s]  That's all good.
[5439.55s -> 5439.87s]  Okay.
[5439.87s -> 5440.83s]  So I got this family.
[5440.83s -> 5441.47s]  We're going to move them in.
[5442.56s -> 5443.04s]  Let's see.
[5445.37s -> 5448.09s]  Click the check to save the pear household.
[5448.09s -> 5451.79s]  No, this is the, no, this is the fruits.
[5452.43s -> 5455.63s]  The fruits household.
[5464.89s -> 5465.21s]  Okay.
[5465.21s -> 5466.57s]  I need to make sure the game is saved.
[5470.57s -> 5471.45s]  That's better.
[5471.45s -> 5477.60s]  Now, okay.
[5477.60s -> 5478.08s]  The fruits.
[5482.52s -> 5484.04s]  So they've got 28 grand.
[5484.04s -> 5485.24s]  Let me just cheat real quick.
[5500.30s -> 5500.70s]  No way.
[5500.70s -> 5500.94s]  Okay.
[5500.94s -> 5501.82s]  Hold on.
[5501.82s -> 5505.39s]  So this is for, this is one bedroom, two bath.
[5505.39s -> 5507.23s]  This is four bedroom, three bath.
[5508.51s -> 5510.75s]  Weekly rent is $3,500 a week.
[5515.07s -> 5515.87s]  Who's my neighbor?
[5517.29s -> 5517.77s]  Lobo?
[5518.33s -> 5528.36s]  All right.
[5528.36s -> 5538.08s]  This is the one that has to be with only this five people.
[5538.08s -> 5541.12s]  Furnishing is a hundred thousand dollars.
[5541.12s -> 5546.08s]  A huge family home with luxury chef's kitchen.
[5546.08s -> 5548.56s]  This apartment is the epitome of uptown chic living.
[5549.12s -> 5553.42s]  Let's go.
[5553.98s -> 5561.45s]  Remaining funds, negative 87,000.
[5561.45s -> 5565.10s]  I don't want the damn thing furnished.
[5565.10s -> 5571.12s]  I can't even do this.
[5571.12s -> 5572.56s]  I have to move into like a shitty place
[5572.56s -> 5573.76s]  then get a bunch of money and move.
[5577.07s -> 5578.75s]  Type free real estate.
[5578.75s -> 5590.33s]  Command fail.
[5590.33s -> 5597.55s]  Free, you need to enable cheats.
[5597.55s -> 5598.83s]  Testing cheats on.
[5598.83s -> 5603.92s]  Oh, is it on?
[5603.92s -> 5617.28s]  Command fail.
[5617.28s -> 5618.80s]  I need to move a family in first.
[5618.80s -> 5627.45s]  Yes, I have to like go to one of these shitty places then.
[5627.45s -> 5629.13s]  I'm just gonna Google it before I just get debated
[5629.13s -> 5630.25s]  for the next 30 minutes.
[5631.23s -> 5632.11s]  Sims cheats.
[5635.52s -> 5636.48s]  Open the cheat console.
[5637.04s -> 5638.67s]  Bring up the cheat dialog box.
[5638.67s -> 5639.15s]  Enter cheats.
[5639.15s -> 5640.11s]  Don't forget to press the yeah.
[5640.11s -> 5640.83s]  Okay.
[5640.83s -> 5641.15s]  Thanks.
[5641.87s -> 5646.84s]  Thanks for telling me how to open the cheat box.
[5647.48s -> 5649.61s]  Hey, here's how you open the cheat box.
[5650.33s -> 5651.29s]  That's it.
[5651.29s -> 5651.85s]  Okay, thanks.
[5652.41s -> 5658.62s]  All right, here we go.
[5658.62s -> 5661.26s]  I'm gonna get like five auto playing videos.
[5661.90s -> 5665.02s]  Okay.
[5667.29s -> 5668.73s]  Testing cheats space true.
[5669.29s -> 5677.29s]  Okay.
[5677.29s -> 5687.02s]  Now, let's see if that does anything.
[5699.68s -> 5704.40s]  All right, so I'm just gonna move.
[5704.40s -> 5705.76s]  I have to move into a random place.
[5705.76s -> 5706.88s]  Why can't I just do it from the menu?
[5714.78s -> 5716.62s]  All right, I need to find like a little shitty apartment.
[5720.19s -> 5721.71s]  All of us have to move in here.
[5721.71s -> 5722.35s]  All right, good luck.
[5724.19s -> 5727.23s]  Would you like to move in with or evict the Pizzai victim?
[5727.23s -> 5728.51s]  Get the fuck out of my way.
[5728.51s -> 5740.48s]  Yeah, I got rid of the pizza family.
[5740.48s -> 5741.52s]  All right, here we go.
[5741.52s -> 5745.85s]  This is really important.
[5745.85s -> 5746.89s]  I have to like pause the game
[5746.89s -> 5748.89s]  because there are a ton of fucked up mods.
[5749.45s -> 5755.21s]  And I need to be totally sure that nothing happens here when I'm gone.
[5755.21s -> 5756.17s]  Because if I get...
[5756.17s -> 5756.65s]  Hold on.
[5757.21s -> 5759.93s]  What are you doing?
[5760.81s -> 5761.45s]  No, no, no, no.
[5761.45s -> 5762.01s]  Go back, go back, go back.
[5762.01s -> 5763.85s]  Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
[5763.85s -> 5764.81s]  What the hell just happened?
[5765.87s -> 5767.55s]  Get in here before everybody kills each other.
[5767.55s -> 5767.87s]  Come on.
[5768.59s -> 5774.68s]  How do I...
[5774.68s -> 5775.48s]  What just happened?
[5777.71s -> 5778.67s]  Oh my God.
[5778.67s -> 5785.63s]  Okay, thank God.
[5785.63s -> 5786.43s]  There we go.
[5786.43s -> 5806.19s]  All right, let's get out of here.
[5806.19s -> 5807.07s]  That's good.
[5807.07s -> 5817.77s]  All right, let's live right here.
[5817.77s -> 5818.09s]  Move.
[5820.49s -> 5821.85s]  Invite up to seven other Sims.
[5821.85s -> 5822.25s]  Select sit...
[5822.25s -> 5822.89s]  No, no, no, no.
[5822.89s -> 5823.13s]  Buy.
[5824.64s -> 5825.76s]  We're traveling.
[5826.65s -> 5827.21s]  Okay, do I...
[5827.21s -> 5828.73s]  How do I like get them out of here?
[5828.73s -> 5834.76s]  You have to use your phone to move.
[5834.76s -> 5836.67s]  Oh, okay.
[5836.67s -> 5840.22s]  Check social media.
[5840.22s -> 5841.50s]  Plan an event.
[5841.50s -> 5842.30s]  Work.
[5842.30s -> 5843.77s]  Household.
[5843.77s -> 5845.37s]  Here's the dealing drugs.
[5845.93s -> 5846.67s]  Household.
[5848.00s -> 5849.44s]  Buy a retail, buy a vet.
[5849.44s -> 5850.16s]  Purchase gifts.
[5850.16s -> 5850.96s]  Hire a service.
[5863.58s -> 5864.46s]  God damn it.
[5864.46s -> 5865.18s]  Oh, fuck that.
[5865.18s -> 5866.78s]  You evicted people to move somewhere else.
[5867.50s -> 5869.31s]  Travel.
[5870.11s -> 5870.99s]  Move household.
[5870.99s -> 5871.95s]  That's not traveling.
[5875.88s -> 5879.37s]  Okay, okay.
[5879.37s -> 5880.09s]  Move household.
[5881.72s -> 5883.48s]  Oh, don't...
[5883.48s -> 5884.12s]  Be careful.
[5884.12s -> 5885.00s]  Don't do anything stupid.
[5885.80s -> 5890.06s]  Don't do anything stupid.
[5890.06s -> 5890.62s]  Wait.
[5890.62s -> 5891.50s]  Everybody just wait.
[5891.50s -> 5891.90s]  Get in.
[5893.53s -> 5894.17s]  Make the call.
[5894.17s -> 5894.97s]  Hurry up.
[5894.97s -> 5909.90s]  Bingo.
[5909.90s -> 5910.38s]  Let's move.
[5911.74s -> 5913.50s]  The fruits household is moving.
[5916.76s -> 5918.04s]  Keep furniture.
[5918.04s -> 5918.52s]  Wait.
[5918.52s -> 5919.56s]  No, no, no, no.
[5919.56s -> 5920.52s]  Sell furniture.
[5920.52s -> 5922.04s]  I'm not going to bring all the furniture with me.
[5922.04s -> 5922.44s]  Furnished.
[5922.44s -> 5923.32s]  Let's go.
[5923.32s -> 5939.10s]  So, welcome to the stream, everybody.
[5940.94s -> 5943.10s]  Here is why I wanted to do this in the first place.
[5943.74s -> 5945.47s]  This is first person.
[5946.27s -> 5947.07s]  On the Sims 4.
[5947.63s -> 5953.79s]  I'm going to go ahead and save it real quick.
[5956.49s -> 5957.21s]  Save as...
[5960.62s -> 5962.30s]  Call this the fruit household.
[5962.30s -> 5962.70s]  Fruits.
[5963.50s -> 5965.72s]  Okay.
[5966.44s -> 5968.97s]  My current game.
[5968.97s -> 5969.93s]  That's fine.
[5969.93s -> 5970.25s]  Save.
[5972.54s -> 5972.86s]  All right.
[5975.36s -> 5975.92s]  Here we are.
[5975.92s -> 5977.68s]  Let's just test a few things to make sure they work.
[5979.20s -> 5981.68s]  This place is fucking huge and it's beautiful.
[5987.13s -> 5987.69s]  Get to know.
[5988.73s -> 5989.77s]  More choices.
[5989.77s -> 5990.17s]  There's...
[5991.29s -> 5992.33s]  Sim Torments.
[5993.53s -> 5994.41s]  This is a new one.
[5996.43s -> 5998.03s]  I don't want to do this right off the bat.
[6001.37s -> 6003.69s]  But sometimes you just have to try.
[6020.73s -> 6022.54s]  No, no, no, no.
[6022.54s -> 6023.66s]  Plead, plead, plead.
[6023.66s -> 6023.98s]  All right.
[6023.98s -> 6025.34s]  This is perfect already.
[6025.34s -> 6026.46s]  We can't jump right into...
[6026.46s -> 6027.90s]  I was supposed to wait.
[6027.90s -> 6028.38s]  No, no, no.
[6028.38s -> 6028.94s]  Load game.
[6029.98s -> 6031.02s]  Load game.
[6031.02s -> 6031.98s]  I'm going to load the game.
[6034.09s -> 6041.58s]  And we can't go that hard yet.
[6041.58s -> 6042.30s]  Okay.
[6042.30s -> 6043.96s]  Everything's going to be just fine.
[6043.96s -> 6052.25s]  Load game.
[6054.96s -> 6055.44s]  That's it.
[6056.00s -> 6056.56s]  See you later.
[6056.56s -> 6057.92s]  That's pretty much what the stream is.
[6058.00s -> 6058.72s]  See you tomorrow.
[6063.69s -> 6064.89s]  So we have the fruits here.
[6064.89s -> 6069.87s]  I need to make a couple of people before we do anything.
[6069.87s -> 6071.07s]  In the same complex, maybe?
[6071.07s -> 6072.43s]  Can I get rid of Lobo?
[6075.02s -> 6076.06s]  We need them to have neighbors.
[6082.22s -> 6083.42s]  There are already people that are here.
[6084.06s -> 6085.82s]  Let me see some of the neighbors, though.
[6085.82s -> 6089.71s]  Who lives here?
[6090.27s -> 6090.99s]  Nobody.
[6090.99s -> 6094.06s]  Who lives here?
[6097.20s -> 6098.48s]  The Feng family.
[6099.71s -> 6103.71s]  So we will come across random people who have been randomly generated.
[6103.71s -> 6107.16s]  The karaoke legends.
[6109.69s -> 6111.53s]  I'm not going to kill Lobo.
[6111.53s -> 6113.29s]  No, not yet.
[6114.01s -> 6119.00s]  We need to get started first.
[6123.50s -> 6125.10s]  I'm not killing Lobo.
[6125.10s -> 6127.20s]  But I will make...
[6127.20s -> 6128.64s]  We have to make one more family.
[6129.66s -> 6131.58s]  Somebody has to be the drug dealer.
[6131.58s -> 6134.65s]  We need to kill Lobo for the fireplace.
[6134.65s -> 6135.13s]  Not yet.
[6140.76s -> 6141.56s]  Let's go back here.
[6142.36s -> 6145.18s]  And not destinations.
[6147.71s -> 6149.07s]  Where's the new family?
[6149.07s -> 6149.79s]  Create a new household.
[6149.79s -> 6150.03s]  Okay.
[6150.75s -> 6152.40s]  I need to make the gnome.
[6157.77s -> 6158.17s]  Gnome.
[6159.96s -> 6160.60s]  It doesn't matter.
[6162.70s -> 6163.90s]  Gnome is just anything.
[6166.32s -> 6168.08s]  Uh, what is this?
[6178.75s -> 6179.63s]  Male pregnancy.
[6181.63s -> 6181.95s]  Okay.
[6182.51s -> 6190.12s]  Let's go ahead and do formal wear.
[6190.12s -> 6191.32s]  It's going to be the costume as well.
[6192.97s -> 6193.85s]  That car, man.
[6195.08s -> 6196.04s]  I'm going to abuse that.
[6212.25s -> 6213.77s]  No, I'm not a gnoblin.
[6214.33s -> 6219.53s]  I don't know why I'm doing this.
[6219.53s -> 6220.33s]  This is...
[6220.33s -> 6223.74s]  I'm just embracing the ultimate...
[6224.86s -> 6235.07s]  I'm embracing the ultimate annoying meme right now.
[6235.07s -> 6235.87s]  Oh, formal.
[6235.87s -> 6237.07s]  I can't change formal wear.
[6237.71s -> 6243.45s]  Is it just a randomized button?
[6243.45s -> 6243.77s]  There is.
[6259.20s -> 6259.60s]  Wow.
[6259.60s -> 6260.64s]  That was a gnome right there.
[6264.33s -> 6264.81s]  That's fine.
[6264.81s -> 6266.09s]  You can look just like this.
[6266.81s -> 6269.10s]  Just remove formal wear.
[6269.82s -> 6274.14s]  Uh, okay.
[6274.14s -> 6274.38s]  Cool.
[6277.13s -> 6278.01s]  Full body.
[6278.01s -> 6279.37s]  Let's get that gnome outfit on.
[6280.17s -> 6285.02s]  All right.
[6285.02s -> 6285.42s]  Watch out.
[6287.84s -> 6288.64s]  Sportswear.
[6289.28s -> 6292.03s]  Doesn't matter where we are.
[6292.59s -> 6293.95s]  You're always going to be in that.
[6300.20s -> 6300.92s]  Sleepwear.
[6301.56s -> 6303.16s]  Yep.
[6303.16s -> 6303.72s]  Doesn't matter.
[6304.60s -> 6310.38s]  I guess I could just type in gnome, couldn't I?
[6318.57s -> 6318.89s]  No.
[6318.89s -> 6320.84s]  Where the fuck is it?
[6320.84s -> 6329.18s]  Where is it?
[6329.18s -> 6335.20s]  Am I going to not use it here?
[6335.20s -> 6337.04s]  You can't go to sleep in the giant costume?
[6341.31s -> 6344.62s]  Do I actually keep this in it?
[6344.62s -> 6353.29s]  No, I do not.
[6353.29s -> 6353.77s]  I do.
[6353.77s -> 6354.97s]  What a fucking idiot.
[6354.97s -> 6369.84s]  Can you actually go swimming in this?
[6369.84s -> 6371.36s]  Oh, there's going to be so much to do.
[6373.07s -> 6374.59s]  There's so much to do.
[6374.59s -> 6385.88s]  Is this person going to die inside of this costume?
[6389.32s -> 6392.20s]  They really might.
[6392.20s -> 6392.60s]  All right.
[6392.60s -> 6393.08s]  Looking good.
[6396.73s -> 6398.17s]  Pretty close too, actually.
[6398.17s -> 6398.65s]  For voice.
[6411.18s -> 6411.82s]  That looks good.
[6417.00s -> 6417.24s]  Okay.
[6418.38s -> 6419.42s]  Uh, deviancy.
[6420.40s -> 6420.88s]  Mischief.
[6422.28s -> 6423.72s]  Uh, I need to put on...
[6424.60s -> 6427.21s]  I think I need to put on, like, the drug.
[6431.16s -> 6431.72s]  Where is...
[6431.72s -> 6434.28s]  I actually think there's a drug dealer trait that I have to put on.
[6438.28s -> 6439.64s]  Incredibly popular, by the way.
[6439.64s -> 6440.68s]  Joke Star or...
[6442.06s -> 6443.50s]  I mean, I have to do Joke Star.
[6445.13s -> 6445.77s]  Let's see here.
[6445.77s -> 6446.33s]  Where is...
[6451.44s -> 6453.04s]  These sims refrain from using alcohol.
[6453.68s -> 6454.40s]  No, no, no.
[6454.40s -> 6454.88s]  Where is it?
[6455.68s -> 6459.58s]  They actually have to have this trait.
[6463.84s -> 6464.96s]  Neat slob.
[6464.96s -> 6465.76s]  Lazy.
[6465.76s -> 6466.48s]  Where is it?
[6466.48s -> 6467.28s]  Am I missing it here?
[6469.04s -> 6469.44s]  Evil.
[6470.24s -> 6473.42s]  Committal.
[6473.42s -> 6473.82s]  Mean.
[6473.82s -> 6474.38s]  Insider.
[6475.10s -> 6479.31s]  Kleptomania.
[6479.31s -> 6479.63s]  Am I...
[6479.63s -> 6480.83s]  What is wrong with me?
[6481.63s -> 6483.42s]  I'm looking for, like, drug dealer.
[6491.90s -> 6492.30s]  Oh.
[6492.30s -> 6492.70s]  It's got...
[6492.70s -> 6492.94s]  I can't...
[6492.94s -> 6493.90s]  That's because it's, like...
[6493.90s -> 6494.62s]  That looks weird.
[6494.62s -> 6495.66s]  It's, like, rolled up.
[6496.54s -> 6497.58s]  That looks like a cork.
[6498.38s -> 6500.54s]  I was expecting to look for, like, drugs.
[6501.18s -> 6504.00s]  I'm not a wine cork.
[6504.00s -> 6507.23s]  All right.
[6507.23s -> 6507.79s]  Here we go.
[6507.79s -> 6508.59s]  Materialistic.
[6513.13s -> 6515.37s]  And, uh, evil.
[6515.37s -> 6521.74s]  Sounds good.
[6522.30s -> 6523.96s]  Let's put you somewhere.
[6524.60s -> 6528.91s]  Anything else I need to do?
[6528.91s -> 6529.47s]  I don't think so.
[6533.18s -> 6533.66s]  Animals?
[6533.66s -> 6535.74s]  No, we did the drug dealer animal house already.
[6539.90s -> 6541.42s]  An evil meal chum.
[6541.98s -> 6545.72s]  Who else would live in this house?
[6545.72s -> 6548.28s]  What are some of the fucking stupid memes that I could put in here?
[6548.28s -> 6549.56s]  In, like, the drug meme house?
[6550.36s -> 6552.64s]  Let me see.
[6561.74s -> 6562.30s]  Garfield?
[6562.94s -> 6564.28s]  Put the vroomer...
[6564.28s -> 6565.80s]  No, the vroomer's gonna have his own house.
[6566.52s -> 6567.58s]  No.
[6568.62s -> 6568.86s]  This...
[6568.86s -> 6570.30s]  The drug dealer's gonna have their own house.
[6570.94s -> 6572.35s]  Just one little apartment.
[6572.99s -> 6577.66s]  We'll have the meme house in a minute here.
[6578.22s -> 6586.88s]  That's enough for, um, not a gonoblin.
[6587.52s -> 6589.56s]  Is there one where he jumps in front of the camera?
[6589.56s -> 6590.12s]  That looks good.
[6595.61s -> 6596.73s]  Not directly next door.
[6596.73s -> 6597.93s]  Some little, just...
[6597.93s -> 6599.37s]  Let's put you in, like, a little dump.
[6600.17s -> 6607.50s]  Who lives around here?
[6607.50s -> 6607.90s]  Nobody.
[6611.66s -> 6613.10s]  I should live with Garfield.
[6617.76s -> 6618.48s]  This one's fine.
[6619.55s -> 6620.43s]  No, no, no.
[6620.43s -> 6621.47s]  One bedroom.
[6621.47s -> 6625.80s]  There's often a party going on.
[6625.80s -> 6626.28s]  That's fine.
[6627.00s -> 6630.28s]  All right, he's in the world.
[6630.84s -> 6641.68s]  Who the hell is this?
[6642.24s -> 6645.20s]  Who is this person?
[6645.20s -> 6649.85s]  Did someone else live...
[6649.85s -> 6650.89s]  I thought this place was empty.
[6658.11s -> 6660.43s]  Oh, I've been going right for the video games.
[6660.43s -> 6661.23s]  Wee bowling.
[6662.97s -> 6664.41s]  Not gonna run her over.
[6664.41s -> 6665.45s]  We can't do that yet.
[6665.45s -> 6666.65s]  Everyone has to just relax.
[6667.21s -> 6678.65s]  Okay, settings.
[6678.65s -> 6680.25s]  Assign NPCs.
[6681.79s -> 6682.59s]  A shaman?
[6683.84s -> 6684.16s]  Wait.
[6684.96s -> 6685.44s]  Hold on.
[6688.60s -> 6690.60s]  I think he needs to have, like, a certain...
[6690.60s -> 6691.64s]  He's the drug dealer right now.
[6691.64s -> 6691.96s]  Let's see.
[6691.96s -> 6692.76s]  Let's open up the phone.
[6694.36s -> 6694.76s]  Dealing.
[6695.90s -> 6696.70s]  Doctor's appointment.
[6696.70s -> 6697.74s]  Invite the shaman over.
[6697.74s -> 6698.54s]  I remember the shaman.
[6698.54s -> 6698.86s]  All right.
[6698.86s -> 6700.62s]  Doctor's appointment is 100 bucks.
[6700.62s -> 6701.26s]  What does that do?
[6702.06s -> 6709.66s]  Am I going to the doctor to get drugs?
[6710.22s -> 6711.80s]  Feeling a bit under the weather?
[6711.80s -> 6713.16s]  God, not a.
[6713.16s -> 6715.24s]  Come by and we'll get you a checkup.
[6715.24s -> 6721.55s]  How do I, like, zoom in on him?
[6721.55s -> 6723.24s]  Can I show him?
[6723.24s -> 6724.20s]  Does he see him in the game world?
[6724.68s -> 6726.41s]  There's nothing wrong with you.
[6727.05s -> 6728.01s]  Don't hesitate to call us
[6728.73s -> 6730.33s]  if you actually feel depressed though.
[6730.33s -> 6733.84s]  I think I just got drugs.
[6739.08s -> 6739.72s]  Uh, okay.
[6739.72s -> 6740.12s]  Hold on.
[6740.76s -> 6752.22s]  Is he just going to do drugs?
[6752.78s -> 6755.60s]  What was inventory?
[6760.67s -> 6761.79s]  Where is their inventory?
[6761.79s -> 6762.99s]  It's, like, down here somewhere, right?
[6763.55s -> 6765.26s]  It's career inventory.
[6765.90s -> 6767.36s]  You don't got anything, man.
[6767.92s -> 6777.05s]  I'm supposed to run him over.
[6781.92s -> 6784.64s]  He's currently making gnome videos.
[6784.64s -> 6789.34s]  He just joined chat.
[6789.34s -> 6790.62s]  He's just putting it in the chat right now.
[6792.00s -> 6793.44s]  Okay, let me save it again here.
[6794.08s -> 6799.69s]  Oh, let me try this one.
[6799.69s -> 6800.19s]  Oh.
[6806.48s -> 6808.16s]  Call over partners in crime.
[6816.01s -> 6817.69s]  Take a selfie with a gun.
[6818.25s -> 6821.23s]  I'll use this one in my next video.
[6826.84s -> 6827.88s]  I can't even see.
[6829.37s -> 6830.49s]  He's too small.
[6832.57s -> 6833.61s]  Where's the gun?
[6833.61s -> 6849.28s]  No, it's because I was in a weird spot.
[6849.28s -> 6850.48s]  He's still holding the gun.
[6851.04s -> 6855.48s]  And we still have some population to take care of.
[6855.48s -> 6864.81s]  You can upgrade that.
[6867.02s -> 6876.16s]  Try to calm down in...
[6876.16s -> 6877.36s]  No, he's not going to kill anybody.
[6878.16s -> 6879.92s]  Automatic killing is off at the moment.
[6880.48s -> 6883.74s]  All right, that's fine.
[6883.74s -> 6885.10s]  He's doing just fine.
[6885.10s -> 6885.82s]  Let's head back.
[6885.82s -> 6887.10s]  Make our last household.
[6887.74s -> 6896.01s]  Wait a minute.
[6896.01s -> 6896.97s]  Welcome to the neighborhood.
[6899.77s -> 6900.97s]  Holy fuck.
[6900.97s -> 6902.72s]  The ghost!
[6902.72s -> 6903.20s]  Say hello!
[6918.40s -> 6920.40s]  It's Alita Battle Angel.
[6922.43s -> 6924.35s]  What does that guy have on the plate?
[6924.35s -> 6926.09s]  Is it like a meat cake?
[6926.09s -> 6940.89s]  Oh, what's this?
[6942.28s -> 6942.92s]  Fucking dick.
[6951.90s -> 6952.30s]  Funny...
[6953.34s -> 6955.95s]  I knocked...
[6955.95s -> 6957.07s]  I delay knocked him out.
[6957.07s -> 6959.56s]  He was at like 6,000 ping.
[6959.56s -> 6960.06s]  All right.
[6961.56s -> 6963.96s]  Let's tell an unbelievable story.
[6963.96s -> 6968.92s]  That was such a delayed knockout.
[6969.56s -> 6972.00s]  Fell asleep in five seconds.
[6973.82s -> 6974.94s]  No, I can't do it.
[6975.74s -> 6976.54s]  I can't do it.
[6977.58s -> 6978.38s]  Please.
[6978.38s -> 6979.58s]  We can't go this far.
[6994.01s -> 6994.89s]  It's too late to go.
[6994.89s -> 6995.29s]  I can't.
[6995.29s -> 6996.25s]  I have to do.
[6996.25s -> 6997.21s]  We have to go fake.
[7002.46s -> 7004.30s]  I can't let this get out of control
[7004.30s -> 7005.66s]  this quickly into the stream.
[7011.74s -> 7012.46s]  Somebody just...
[7012.46s -> 7013.58s]  And the chat just broke.
[7013.58s -> 7016.46s]  Can someone please explain what the fuck just happened?
[7038.44s -> 7039.24s]  No one's safe.
[7039.80s -> 7040.84s]  Even inside.
[7040.84s -> 7042.12s]  You're not even safe.
[7042.12s -> 7044.76s]  What else is there?
[7044.76s -> 7045.96s]  I just need to see what they do.
[7047.72s -> 7047.96s]  What?
[7050.92s -> 7053.04s]  What is snatch self?
[7053.68s -> 7076.70s]  Okay, okay.
[7085.95s -> 7090.36s]  It's gonna be a long night.
[7090.36s -> 7090.84s]  I needed to...
[7090.84s -> 7091.24s]  I just need...
[7091.24s -> 7092.68s]  This is the test period.
[7092.68s -> 7094.97s]  I just need to test.
[7094.97s -> 7096.01s]  All I'm doing is testing.
[7096.01s -> 7097.45s]  I haven't seen these yet.
[7097.45s -> 7104.11s]  What?
[7104.11s -> 7104.83s]  P self?
[7110.73s -> 7111.69s]  He's gone.
[7111.69s -> 7122.19s]  I don't know what this means.
[7129.39s -> 7129.71s]  What?
[7135.24s -> 7136.92s]  I don't understand what just happened.
[7137.40s -> 7138.92s]  Why does this person have a face?
[7138.92s -> 7140.44s]  Why does death have a face?
[7141.16s -> 7147.44s]  Death should not have a face?
[7147.44s -> 7147.68s]  This is...
[7153.76s -> 7155.12s]  No, I can't believe it.
[7155.12s -> 7156.40s]  This is ridiculous.
[7156.40s -> 7157.20s]  You took my...
[7162.44s -> 7162.76s]  Gang...
[7162.76s -> 7163.64s]  There's so much here.
[7163.64s -> 7163.96s]  All right.
[7163.96s -> 7164.76s]  It's time to go back.
[7165.32s -> 7186.73s]  That's P.
[7188.48s -> 7188.96s]  All right.
[7188.96s -> 7191.68s]  So we've seen what some of these do.
[7192.56s -> 7194.41s]  Who's crying?
[7197.36s -> 7198.56s]  I'm crying.
[7198.56s -> 7206.22s]  Okay.
[7206.22s -> 7206.78s]  It's time to go.
[7206.78s -> 7208.54s]  We gotta make our final person.
[7212.19s -> 7213.63s]  Send to hell.
[7213.63s -> 7216.17s]  Crack neck?
[7218.52s -> 7219.24s]  Body slam?
[7219.24s -> 7221.00s]  Who does the body slamming?
[7221.00s -> 7236.81s]  That kills you?
[7236.81s -> 7237.29s]  He's dead.
[7241.52s -> 7242.80s]  The game saved...
[7242.80s -> 7244.40s]  Currently in a state where saving isn't possible.
[7245.04s -> 7245.68s]  Don't save.
[7246.24s -> 7256.57s]  I'm gonna load game.
[7256.57s -> 7258.01s]  This is the one right here.
[7258.01s -> 7264.49s]  I just want to see what they did.
[7267.98s -> 7269.42s]  There is the gnome.
[7269.42s -> 7270.14s]  Final family.
[7270.14s -> 7271.50s]  This is the last bit before we just...
[7271.50s -> 7272.54s]  We're gonna play.
[7272.54s -> 7274.04s]  We will get to playing.
[7274.04s -> 7274.76s]  I promise you this.
[7277.24s -> 7278.92s]  This is the final household.
[7278.92s -> 7282.92s]  There's gonna be about three or four people in this household.
[7282.92s -> 7284.52s]  This is the fucking meme family.
[7297.15s -> 7297.65s]  Uh...
[7299.44s -> 7299.94s]  Vroomer.
[7302.44s -> 7304.44s]  I'm just gonna do randomize until I find the right one.
[7314.12s -> 7314.76s]  The memes?
[7314.76s -> 7315.40s]  The memers?
[7319.26s -> 7320.06s]  How about Vroomer?
[7323.20s -> 7325.07s]  Who gives a shit?
[7326.57s -> 7327.61s]  Vroomer McBoomer?
[7328.17s -> 7334.80s]  Vroomer the Reinhardt family.
[7334.80s -> 7335.20s]  Okay.
[7335.20s -> 7335.52s]  Fine.
[7335.52s -> 7335.76s]  Sure.
[7336.32s -> 7340.01s]  All right.
[7340.01s -> 7340.89s]  Final household.
[7341.45s -> 7343.45s]  This is an absolute dickhead.
[7345.45s -> 7347.13s]  Make enemies and be a famous criminal.
[7347.13s -> 7347.61s]  Yeah.
[7347.61s -> 7348.49s]  You're a pain in the ass.
[7350.84s -> 7351.80s]  Incredibly active.
[7354.48s -> 7355.28s]  Uh...
[7355.28s -> 7356.56s]  Is there a car lover?
[7358.94s -> 7359.50s]  Erratic?
[7360.06s -> 7360.56s]  Mm-hmm.
[7365.00s -> 7366.12s]  Loves the outdoors.
[7366.12s -> 7366.76s]  Can't get enough.
[7370.01s -> 7370.51s]  Mean.
[7372.25s -> 7372.57s]  No.
[7372.57s -> 7373.29s]  Mean and evil.
[7373.85s -> 7381.79s]  By the way, if you're curious,
[7381.79s -> 7385.31s]  this is the person that just drives by three or four times a day,
[7385.31s -> 7386.99s]  and they just step on the gas as hard as they can.
[7390.75s -> 7391.95s]  If you don't know who this is.
[7391.95s -> 7392.75s]  Let's randomize.
[7395.61s -> 7396.97s]  Oh, that's close.
[7398.16s -> 7402.48s]  I'm gonna randomize until I see the person that I think is driving by.
[7404.16s -> 7404.66s]  Close.
[7406.08s -> 7406.58s]  No.
[7417.18s -> 7417.82s]  I think I found them.
[7426.80s -> 7461.90s]  Okay.
[7466.86s -> 7467.36s]  Oops.
[7469.12s -> 7469.84s]  Oh, shit.
[7470.72s -> 7471.44s]  No, come back up.
[7471.44s -> 7472.08s]  Back up. Back up.
[7478.62s -> 7479.74s]  You're just making a Chad.
[7480.96s -> 7481.76s]  This is not a Chad.
[7484.32s -> 7484.82s]  Um...
[7485.36s -> 7486.40s]  I didn't do that, but fine.
[7494.01s -> 7495.13s]  Somehow better.
[7495.13s -> 7507.64s]  Why do they always have such fucked up chins?
[7507.64s -> 7508.99s]  There we go.
[7508.99s -> 7509.47s]  I can...
[7509.47s -> 7510.27s]  That's who's...
[7510.27s -> 7511.23s]  That's who you are.
[7511.23s -> 7517.95s]  I know it.
[7517.95s -> 7519.63s]  Put an ad out for this guy.
[7519.63s -> 7522.89s]  To be arrested for speeding.
[7522.89s -> 7530.67s]  This is the police sketch of what they look like.
[7530.67s -> 7559.36s]  Cat ears.
[7559.36s -> 7560.40s]  It just keeps getting better.
[7562.92s -> 7563.64s]  That was not bad.
[7563.64s -> 7564.14s]  This is...
[7565.88s -> 7570.36s]  No, I'm kind of making just Nico from GTA IV.
[7570.36s -> 7586.92s]  I want to go back to the clown here.
[7587.98s -> 7588.54s]  Whoever this is.
[7588.54s -> 7589.90s]  This person is a fucking clown.
[7591.00s -> 7591.96s]  Oh, no.
[7594.52s -> 7595.08s]  No, no.
[7595.08s -> 7596.68s]  That's not the person that's driving around.
[7597.24s -> 7598.36s]  This is clown.
[7598.92s -> 7611.61s]  Okay.
[7611.61s -> 7614.30s]  Oh, that's like Amish.
[7620.35s -> 7621.31s]  That's my haircut.
[7621.31s -> 7623.31s]  This is not even close to my haircut.
[7623.31s -> 7634.12s]  All right, what about for clothes?
[7643.45s -> 7646.09s]  Give him like a Twitch hoodie?
[7646.09s -> 7646.97s]  Clown suit?
[7646.97s -> 7648.88s]  No, no, no, no.
[7648.88s -> 7650.16s]  Like, this is cool.
[7650.16s -> 7662.00s]  Change something here one more time.
[7662.00s -> 7675.77s]  That's better.
[7675.77s -> 7676.89s]  Oh, God. 50 bucks.
[7678.78s -> 7679.42s]  Mostly lost.
[7679.42s -> 7680.78s]  Just gave 50 dollars.
[7680.78s -> 7681.42s]  Thank you.
[7681.50s -> 7685.02s]  I'm not going to let you continue without making this guy's personality bro.
[7690.04s -> 7690.92s]  Is there a bro?
[7697.52s -> 7698.24s]  Outgoing?
[7698.80s -> 7700.08s]  Yeah, but they're mean and evil.
[7701.96s -> 7703.40s]  And they're incredibly erratic.
[7703.40s -> 7707.42s]  They just drive by the house every day.
[7707.42s -> 7708.14s]  No, you're right.
[7710.30s -> 7717.98s]  That's good enough.
[7720.04s -> 7720.44s]  Formal?
[7724.73s -> 7727.10s]  You dress like a dickhead.
[7727.10s -> 7728.14s]  That's your formal wear?
[7728.14s -> 7728.70s]  No jacket?
[7731.08s -> 7732.60s]  You show up to work with no suit jacket on?
[7736.67s -> 7738.68s]  All right.
[7738.68s -> 7739.48s]  Next, we've got...
[7740.44s -> 7741.56s]  Who else can I put here?
[7744.19s -> 7745.07s]  Oh, let's see here.
[7762.12s -> 7762.44s]  Nice.
[7762.44s -> 7762.92s]  That's fine.
[7764.76s -> 7767.87s]  I'll show you what I have for hair.
[7768.43s -> 7769.23s]  It's more like that.
[7769.79s -> 7778.30s]  No, I don't look like Cyclops.
[7780.09s -> 7781.45s]  Last time I made myself a joke.
[7781.45s -> 7783.85s]  This time I'm going to make what I actually look like.
[7783.85s -> 7826.30s]  Get in there.
[7844.51s -> 7853.64s]  I don't mean hair is not correct.
[7853.64s -> 7854.52s]  Yes, it is.
[7854.52s -> 7889.16s]  I know what I look like.
[7889.16s -> 7890.68s]  And this is what I see in the mirror.
[7890.68s -> 7908.35s]  Put on the webcam to compare.
[7908.35s -> 7908.75s]  Hold on.
[7908.75s -> 7909.07s]  I will.
[7909.07s -> 7910.19s]  I just got to put clothes on.
[7910.19s -> 7911.39s]  I got to put like something on.
[7911.39s -> 7915.00s]  Be right back.
[7925.26s -> 7935.68s]  Okay, here.
[7935.68s -> 7936.40s]  Incoming joke.
[7937.60s -> 7938.24s]  There's no joke.
[7938.24s -> 7944.46s]  I just don't have big clothes on.
[7944.46s -> 7945.18s]  Let's see.
[7945.18s -> 7946.70s]  Let's see how accurate this is.
[7946.70s -> 8016.83s]  You're going to turn this a little...
[8042.33s -> 8043.77s]  This is what I see.
[8043.77s -> 8044.41s]  Okay?
[8044.41s -> 8095.05s]  I think that's good.
[8095.05s -> 8095.53s]  Right?
[8095.53s -> 8103.02s]  There it is.
[8103.02s -> 8109.16s]  I think that looks pretty close.
[8109.16s -> 8127.58s]  I need a bigger chin.
[8127.58s -> 8133.34s]  Are you sure?
[8133.34s -> 8136.96s]  No fucking way I don't look like that.
[8136.96s -> 8137.84s]  Bullshit.
[8137.84s -> 8140.78s]  I can't look.
[8140.78s -> 8170.36s]  That's better.
[8170.36s -> 8175.77s]  Are these out far enough?
[8175.77s -> 8180.01s]  See?
[8180.97s -> 8197.12s]  I think that's fine.
[8197.12s -> 8198.08s]  The lips are too big.
[8200.36s -> 8210.88s]  Hold on.
[8210.88s -> 8216.92s]  Let me get in there.
[8216.92s -> 8217.16s]  Okay.
[8217.16s -> 8217.96s]  That looks fine.
[8217.96s -> 8228.44s]  I'm going to grab the corners though.
[8228.44s -> 8228.92s]  How far?
[8228.92s -> 8229.16s]  That's...
[8229.16s -> 8230.04s]  This is kind of up.
[8230.04s -> 8238.81s]  Yeah.
[8238.81s -> 8243.34s]  Higher.
[8243.34s -> 8244.30s]  This ratio is wrong.
[8244.30s -> 8245.58s]  These eyebrows are going to come down.
[8245.58s -> 8249.72s]  Well, the eyes have to go up.
[8249.72s -> 8253.52s]  Yeah.
[8253.52s -> 8254.48s]  This has to come down.
[8254.48s -> 8255.36s]  There we go.
[8255.36s -> 8275.82s]  Am I getting there?
[8275.82s -> 8277.55s]  The nose is too big.
[8277.55s -> 8306.57s]  Eyebrows have to change.
[8306.57s -> 8307.13s]  No.
[8307.13s -> 8310.60s]  There we go.
[8310.60s -> 8312.76s]  Bring them down.
[8312.76s -> 8315.88s]  Bring these out.
[8351.92s -> 8355.40s]  I mean, it looks pretty similar.
[8355.40s -> 8356.20s]  Skin tone.
[8356.20s -> 8356.60s]  Yeah.
[8356.60s -> 8356.92s]  Hold on.
[8356.92s -> 8357.24s]  You're right.
[8357.24s -> 8358.36s]  I got to get the skin tone right.
[8358.36s -> 8379.85s]  There they go.
[8379.85s -> 8382.46s]  I think that's it.
[8383.02s -> 8387.74s]  Let's do it.
[8388.14s -> 8389.34s]  Let's get the whole thing, right?
[8389.34s -> 8413.71s]  The hair is not right?
[8413.71s -> 8418.76s]  No.
[8418.76s -> 8419.48s]  No.
[8419.48s -> 8436.09s]  I think it's perfect.
[8436.09s -> 8443.26s]  Like that.
[8443.26s -> 8447.85s]  This is actually what I see in the mirror.
[8447.85s -> 8448.41s]  Eyebrows.
[8448.41s -> 8449.13s]  Look at my eyebrow.
[8449.13s -> 8449.61s]  But look at...
[8449.61s -> 8451.71s]  Look at...
[8451.71s -> 8462.84s]  See?
[8462.84s -> 8463.72s]  He's a bigger.
[8463.72s -> 8484.88s]  All right.
[8484.88s -> 8486.24s]  Now they're just doing it on purpose.
[8494.28s -> 8496.32s]  That looks good.
[8496.32s -> 8497.44s]  Forehead's bigger.
[8497.44s -> 8514.04s]  Add lipstick.
[8514.04s -> 8515.56s]  Why would I add lipstick?
[8515.56s -> 8520.46s]  All right.
[8520.46s -> 8520.78s]  What about...
[8520.78s -> 8522.14s]  What about if a clothes on right now?
[8522.14s -> 8522.46s]  None.
[8522.46s -> 8523.42s]  I actually don't have any.
[8527.68s -> 8528.64s]  No, I wouldn't wear this.
[8528.64s -> 8534.04s]  I wouldn't wear that.
[8534.04s -> 8535.56s]  My chin's bigger than this.
[8535.56s -> 8537.24s]  It is definitely not bigger than...
[8537.24s -> 8540.16s]  You want to make me look like a cartoon character?
[8540.16s -> 8543.84s]  Pretty stylish.
[8543.84s -> 8544.24s]  No.
[8544.24s -> 8544.72s]  I don't want...
[8545.60s -> 8545.84s]  No.
[8545.84s -> 8547.20s]  Not the black shirt.
[8549.31s -> 8549.95s]  Let's go with...
[8553.95s -> 8556.83s]  I don't want to do like fucking Civil War Soldier.
[8557.55s -> 8562.01s]  Do they have any Star Wars shirts?
[8562.83s -> 8563.31s]  Wait.
[8563.31s -> 8564.03s]  They probably do.
[8565.29s -> 8566.73s]  They have a Darth Vader mask.
[8566.73s -> 8568.81s]  You tell me they don't have a Star Wars t-shirt?
[8568.81s -> 8574.99s]  Where the hell is it?
[8574.99s -> 8575.47s]  Come on.
[8575.47s -> 8576.19s]  Star Wars.
[8579.24s -> 8585.87s]  Damn it.
[8585.87s -> 8587.55s]  I don't want the headphones on.
[8587.55s -> 8590.36s]  Let's go full body for a second.
[8594.44s -> 8597.16s]  I have a big fan of Star Wars but that's not...
[8597.16s -> 8597.88s]  I'm not...
[8597.88s -> 8598.68s]  I wouldn't wear this.
[8599.32s -> 8602.97s]  Just be in the Vader costume.
[8608.91s -> 8610.43s]  This would be my formal outfit.
[8610.43s -> 8610.75s]  Okay?
[8618.65s -> 8619.45s]  Every day though.
[8619.45s -> 8622.01s]  Let's go with like a tank top.
[8622.01s -> 8622.41s]  Okay.
[8622.41s -> 8622.97s]  T-shirts.
[8623.77s -> 8624.81s]  Star Wars.
[8624.81s -> 8625.61s]  Star Wars.
[8627.32s -> 8627.88s]  Tank top.
[8630.84s -> 8631.32s]  Pretty close.
[8631.32s -> 8632.12s]  Sweatshirts.
[8632.12s -> 8632.28s]  No.
[8632.92s -> 8635.20s]  That's fine.
[8636.68s -> 8637.16s]  Bottoms.
[8638.56s -> 8639.44s]  Let's go with...
[8642.99s -> 8643.31s]  I mean...
[8644.67s -> 8645.80s]  Just a pair of jeans.
[8646.44s -> 8647.92s]  Yeah, that's fine.
[8648.48s -> 8652.30s]  That's pretty close to what I would wear.
[8655.69s -> 8657.05s]  Especially in Las Vegas.
[8661.58s -> 8663.26s]  Put those things away.
[8663.26s -> 8664.06s]  What do you mean put the...
[8664.06s -> 8664.78s]  What the things?
[8665.34s -> 8668.51s]  All right.
[8668.51s -> 8669.23s]  I'm happy with this.
[8670.52s -> 8671.56s]  My personality.
[8672.12s -> 8673.08s]  I'm an animal.
[8673.08s -> 8675.16s]  No.
[8675.16s -> 8678.52s]  I would say let's do like creativity.
[8678.52s -> 8680.20s]  I mean like genius.
[8681.08s -> 8682.44s]  Best-selling author.
[8683.69s -> 8684.65s]  Knowledge.
[8684.65s -> 8686.01s]  Really smart.
[8686.01s -> 8687.53s]  Computer whiz.
[8689.31s -> 8690.19s]  Wicked.
[8690.19s -> 8690.99s]  Popular.
[8690.99s -> 8691.79s]  Joke star.
[8695.66s -> 8696.62s]  Leader of the pack.
[8696.62s -> 8697.18s]  I'm a leader.
[8697.82s -> 8699.37s]  Little hot-headed.
[8700.68s -> 8702.04s]  Very, very creative, aren't I?
[8704.43s -> 8706.03s]  And I also am very clumsy.
[8709.68s -> 8710.16s]  I'm good.
[8716.41s -> 8716.65s]  No.
[8717.61s -> 8717.93s]  Fine.
[8719.85s -> 8721.40s]  So who lives here?
[8721.40s -> 8722.12s]  Oh yeah, I forgot.
[8722.12s -> 8723.08s]  I've made this person.
[8726.33s -> 8728.97s]  That is not at all what the person probably looks like.
[8729.53s -> 8733.31s]  Can I go back and delete...
[8733.31s -> 8735.87s]  How do I delete somebody else's character?
[8735.87s -> 8736.67s]  You know what I mean?
[8736.67s -> 8737.15s]  Seriously.
[8741.12s -> 8741.52s]  All right.
[8741.52s -> 8742.64s]  Let's add dog.
[8742.64s -> 8747.24s]  What kind of breed?
[8750.30s -> 8755.93s]  Uh, no, we're not making an auto.
[8755.93s -> 8774.09s]  Let's make a little, a little fucked up on the face.
[8774.09s -> 8774.57s]  That's fine.
[8780.57s -> 8781.85s]  Extra large nose.
[8783.85s -> 8785.21s]  This is the Budweiser dog.
[8785.21s -> 8796.16s]  Yeah, that looks good.
[8800.60s -> 8803.39s]  It's a giant rat.
[8803.39s -> 8804.03s]  Mm-hmm.
[8804.03s -> 8808.12s]  It's a giant rat.
[8808.12s -> 8808.76s]  Perfect.
[8808.76s -> 8811.52s]  What about the tail here?
[8811.52s -> 8812.80s]  You can change the tail.
[8812.80s -> 8815.04s]  No, rat tails are thin.
[8820.96s -> 8823.44s]  Little legs if I can make them smaller.
[8823.44s -> 8830.09s]  Let's go in detail mode here.
[8830.65s -> 8835.58s]  Can I make these any bigger?
[8835.58s -> 8856.20s]  No, it just looks like a bird.
[8856.20s -> 8857.00s]  A duck.
[8857.00s -> 8863.76s]  Eyes all the way back.
[8863.76s -> 8864.64s]  It's a rat.
[8864.64s -> 8875.42s]  It does look sad.
[8875.42s -> 8876.30s]  Yeah, I gotta make it...
[8876.30s -> 8877.66s]  I gotta make the dog not sad.
[8877.66s -> 8878.62s]  The rat, whatever.
[8878.62s -> 8889.92s]  It just always looks sad.
[8889.92s -> 8890.24s]  Why?
[8893.85s -> 8895.05s]  Why do you look sad?
[8895.05s -> 8910.92s]  Let me go make the body bigger.
[8910.92s -> 8923.74s]  That's so creepy looking.
[8923.74s -> 8924.30s]  Okay.
[8924.30s -> 8926.09s]  I think that's good.
[8926.09s -> 8931.36s]  I think it's a mouth that's doing it.
[8931.36s -> 8945.31s]  How big are rat's ears?
[8945.31s -> 8946.92s]  Are they huge?
[8946.92s -> 8948.60s]  They're big, right?
[8948.60s -> 8949.40s]  No, they're tiny.
[8949.40s -> 8950.20s]  How big are they?
[8950.20s -> 8962.99s]  They're like that.
[8962.99s -> 8963.71s]  They're massive.
[8963.71s -> 8964.99s]  Let me say rat.
[8964.99s -> 8968.75s]  Yeah, they're a little tiny.
[8968.75s -> 8969.79s]  They look like this.
[8969.79s -> 8976.12s]  Okay, here we go.
[8977.72s -> 8981.84s]  Now we need to have a coat here.
[8982.40s -> 8989.52s]  I think I can just do fur, right?
[8989.52s -> 8993.56s]  Here we go.
[8993.56s -> 8999.64s]  Here we go.
[8999.64s -> 9000.92s]  That's kind of rat-like.
[9000.92s -> 9006.64s]  That's pretty close.
[9006.64s -> 9013.13s]  That's better.
[9013.13s -> 9013.77s]  That's better, yeah.
[9013.77s -> 9014.89s]  Paint the tail pink.
[9016.68s -> 9018.84s]  Paint the tail and paws pink.
[9018.84s -> 9020.19s]  That's a good idea.
[9020.19s -> 9035.74s]  All right, let's paint.
[9035.74s -> 9036.54s]  And the ears.
[9039.39s -> 9054.11s]  Damn it.
[9054.11s -> 9055.23s]  That not so pink.
[9055.23s -> 9058.91s]  What do you mean not so pink?
[9058.91s -> 9060.59s]  Not Barbie pink?
[9060.59s -> 9062.54s]  It's too dark.
[9062.54s -> 9090.38s]  What?
[9090.38s -> 9091.58s]  Pale pink.
[9091.58s -> 9094.75s]  Well, who cares?
[9095.31s -> 9098.72s]  What?
[9098.72s -> 9099.12s]  Salmon?
[9099.12s -> 9099.92s]  That's like salmon.
[9099.92s -> 9101.04s]  That's fresh salmon.
[9101.04s -> 9108.81s]  Oh, it's never going to get fixed.
[9108.81s -> 9110.09s]  I have to do the whole thing again here.
[9110.09s -> 9123.79s]  Okay, that's better.
[9123.79s -> 9126.40s]  Oh, who cares?
[9126.40s -> 9133.31s]  So let's go pink.
[9133.31s -> 9136.97s]  Is that better?
[9136.97s -> 9138.28s]  That's salmon.
[9138.28s -> 9141.07s]  That's a salmon color.
[9141.07s -> 9152.49s]  He's done it.
[9152.49s -> 9153.61s]  He's finally done it.
[9153.61s -> 9161.77s]  Now let's get the tail.
[9161.77s -> 9170.27s]  What color are rat's feet?
[9170.27s -> 9171.39s]  Also pink too, right?
[9171.39s -> 9183.23s]  Yeah, it's like the same color.
[9183.23s -> 9186.52s]  All right, roll over.
[9186.52s -> 9191.00s]  I want to get the underside of your tail here.
[9191.00s -> 9196.67s]  All right, you're good.
[9196.67s -> 9210.89s]  Now let's get your paws disturbing.
[9219.31s -> 9231.64s]  That's how far it goes up, right?
[9231.72s -> 9232.76s]  It goes up a little further.
[9232.76s -> 9236.12s]  I painted on it.
[9236.12s -> 9236.84s]  It's like knees.
[9238.20s -> 9239.80s]  I didn't mean to, but that's okay.
[9239.80s -> 9247.13s]  I'm gonna give you the eraser.
[9247.13s -> 9247.45s]  I'll get it.
[9247.45s -> 9251.92s]  I'll clean it up.
[9251.92s -> 9255.60s]  Gloves there.
[9255.60s -> 9256.56s]  Perfect.
[9256.56s -> 9257.44s]  All right, stand up.
[9257.44s -> 9272.32s]  Let's get a good look at you.
[9272.32s -> 9274.48s]  That's just a quick little reference
[9274.48s -> 9275.84s]  to people that saw the last one.
[9275.84s -> 9284.40s]  Okay, let's draw whiskers.
[9284.40s -> 9291.64s]  Kind of already done for us here.
[9291.64s -> 9296.08s]  Now I can do them myself.
[9296.08s -> 9297.12s]  Thank you very much.
[9297.12s -> 9300.62s]  Which way do they go?
[9300.62s -> 9301.10s]  Out?
[9301.10s -> 9315.48s]  How do they look?
[9315.48s -> 9320.11s]  Wrapped face.
[9320.11s -> 9320.67s]  No, they're only...
[9321.92s -> 9323.44s]  The nose is pink too.
[9323.44s -> 9330.38s]  Here, stand up straight.
[9330.38s -> 9333.47s]  Let me see that nose.
[9333.71s -> 9336.08s]  I can't do the nose.
[9336.08s -> 9338.08s]  Nose is unpaintable.
[9338.08s -> 9347.95s]  Guys, sorry.
[9347.95s -> 9350.73s]  Maybe I could do it on the nose option.
[9350.73s -> 9352.49s]  All right, let's give them whiskers first.
[9352.49s -> 9361.29s]  They gotta be smaller than that.
[9361.29s -> 9366.83s]  And they gotta be clear, gray.
[9366.83s -> 9383.42s]  All right, let's go to the nose.
[9387.05s -> 9390.41s]  Tails, body, fur, pet clothing.
[9390.41s -> 9394.80s]  And I do nose.
[9394.80s -> 9398.99s]  Body, breeds, tails.
[9398.99s -> 9400.28s]  How do I get to it?
[9400.28s -> 9411.64s]  Just click on his nose.
[9411.64s -> 9412.92s]  The eyes though, the eyes have to be...
[9414.78s -> 9417.76s]  Yeah, there we go.
[9417.76s -> 9428.12s]  Holy shit, that's pretty close.
[9428.12s -> 9429.16s]  Get rid of the whiskers.
[9429.16s -> 9430.76s]  The whiskers just fuck it all up.
[9430.76s -> 9442.89s]  Oh no, I kind of missed them now.
[9442.89s -> 9443.93s]  Hold on, let me try again.
[9443.93s -> 9450.25s]  Let's go with like three.
[9450.25s -> 9466.89s]  What an even worse proximity.
[9466.89s -> 9476.73s]  That's like a cat though.
[9476.73s -> 9492.64s]  Get a little darker.
[9492.64s -> 9493.36s]  Got it!
[9493.36s -> 9502.83s]  All right.
[9502.83s -> 9506.16s]  Hello, my name is Giant Rat.
[9506.16s -> 9510.38s]  There you are.
[9510.38s -> 9515.85s]  Wait, there's a little bullshit mark right here.
[9515.85s -> 9517.53s]  These paws need to be cleaned up a little bit.
[9517.53s -> 9519.05s]  I'm not gonna just have to suck.
[9519.05s -> 9531.31s]  Bigger brush.
[9531.31s -> 9536.72s]  I'm not just gonna have to suck, guys.
[9536.72s -> 9551.00s]  This is Giant Rat.
[9551.00s -> 9552.12s]  Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.
[9552.12s -> 9553.00s]  All right, there it is.
[9553.00s -> 9554.36s]  Look at that avatar.
[9554.36s -> 9555.32s]  It's perfect.
[9555.32s -> 9558.12s]  So this household is Vroomer...
[9560.78s -> 9562.92s]  Jeremy Reinhardt.
[9562.92s -> 9565.52s]  Vroomer Reinhardt.
[9565.52s -> 9569.15s]  Giant Rat.
[9569.15s -> 9570.43s]  And let's go with another...
[9570.43s -> 9570.99s]  I'm just gonna...
[9570.99s -> 9572.59s]  I'm gonna see what I can do here.
[9572.59s -> 9573.52s]  I'm gonna make...
[9574.48s -> 9575.36s]  We'll find out.
[9575.36s -> 9583.16s]  Here we go.
[9583.16s -> 9584.12s]  Clear everything.
[9584.12s -> 9587.76s]  Clear hair.
[9589.28s -> 9589.76s]  All hair.
[9589.76s -> 9590.40s]  All right, all right.
[9590.40s -> 9591.36s]  Let's start.
[9591.36s -> 9594.72s]  Start with the nose first.
[9594.72s -> 9602.75s]  Let me out there.
[9603.31s -> 9604.11s]  What do I grab?
[9604.11s -> 9605.15s]  I want to grab this.
[9615.85s -> 9616.97s]  Okay, I have to make an elephant.
[9624.33s -> 9625.37s]  Come on now.
[9625.37s -> 9631.58s]  Let me just grab in there.
[9640.99s -> 9642.75s]  You know you want to let me do this.
[9642.75s -> 9665.36s]  Come on.
[9665.36s -> 9666.16s]  Nice.
[9666.16s -> 9677.58s]  Elephant.
[9677.58s -> 9684.64s]  Bring it in.
[9684.64s -> 9691.02s]  Looking good so far.
[9691.02s -> 9692.78s]  I like the kind of Dumbo eyes.
[9697.66s -> 9698.46s]  Fuck.
[9698.46s -> 9714.96s]  Okay.
[9714.96s -> 9723.98s]  How much further down can that go?
[9723.98s -> 9727.31s]  I think that's as far as it can go.
[9727.31s -> 9733.56s]  Unless I can...
[9733.56s -> 9735.00s]  No, that's perfect right there.
[9735.64s -> 9741.16s]  Wait a minute.
[9741.16s -> 9741.72s]  No, fuck it.
[9741.72s -> 9742.84s]  I'm making a goddamn bird.
[9743.56s -> 9744.52s]  This is a bird.
[9744.52s -> 9745.00s]  This is big.
[9745.56s -> 9752.81s]  It's like a pelican.
[9752.81s -> 9768.80s]  I need to make this mouth much smaller.
[9768.80s -> 9774.76s]  This is just...
[9774.76s -> 9776.04s]  I'm making the seagull.
[9776.04s -> 9777.34s]  Here.
[9777.34s -> 9778.06s]  Saved forever.
[9796.62s -> 9817.52s]  Well, never mind.
[9817.52s -> 9818.64s]  It's a faucet.
[9830.25s -> 9830.89s]  Delete this.
[9831.84s -> 9834.11s]  No, it's staying.
[9834.11s -> 9856.92s]  This is terrifying.
[9856.92s -> 9858.12s]  Make the eyes red.
[9865.36s -> 9875.85s]  This needs to come up.
[9875.85s -> 9890.03s]  It's better.
[9890.03s -> 9901.31s]  I need to get that mouth much smaller.
[9901.31s -> 9908.24s]  Maybe actually...
[9908.24s -> 9909.12s]  Hold on.
[9909.12s -> 9911.10s]  Bring this back up a little.
[9911.10s -> 9915.92s]  Wait.
[9915.92s -> 9916.72s]  That's good.
[9916.72s -> 9950.30s]  Okay.
[9950.86s -> 9955.40s]  That's a pretty good elephant.
[9959.76s -> 9966.00s]  Just got to do the ears.
[9976.64s -> 9978.48s]  Oh, easy.
[9978.48s -> 9986.99s]  No, I got to go bigger than that.
[9986.99s -> 9988.27s]  They can't go bigger than that.
[9988.35s -> 10001.71s]  I don't know why there's an elephant living in this house.
[10001.71s -> 10003.71s]  Please kill this one right away.
[10003.71s -> 10006.51s]  Oh, I must just throw up.
[10006.51s -> 10010.41s]  This stream hadn't even gotten started yet, guys.
[10010.41s -> 10014.36s]  Do you guys understand?
[10014.36s -> 10015.72s]  We haven't even begun.
[10015.72s -> 10024.80s]  I wonder, is the...
[10026.38s -> 10029.10s]  I mean, elephants' heads are fucking huge.
[10029.10s -> 10030.38s]  They are huge.
[10030.38s -> 10031.45s]  But that's just...
[10032.49s -> 10033.29s]  It doesn't look right.
[10033.29s -> 10034.01s]  It looks strange.
[10034.65s -> 10042.97s]  There's five and a half thousand people here for the pretty stream.
[10042.97s -> 10043.93s]  I'm welcome.
[10043.93s -> 10044.81s]  Hope you're having a good time.
[10045.37s -> 10047.05s]  We haven't even started the stream yet.
[10047.05s -> 10051.48s]  This looks like Stuart Little, somebody said.
[10056.59s -> 10057.23s]  That's better.
[10057.23s -> 10058.99s]  It can't be that ridiculously huge.
[10059.71s -> 10060.36s]  I need to get...
[10061.00s -> 10062.84s]  See, when I go into detail mode, can I spin them?
[10063.48s -> 10064.20s]  All right, here we go.
[10065.63s -> 10066.27s]  Oh, come on.
[10066.27s -> 10068.14s]  Don't do this to me.
[10077.60s -> 10078.99s]  Better?
[10078.99s -> 10079.95s]  I think they're out more now.
[10084.68s -> 10085.88s]  What elephants wear for clothes?
[10088.20s -> 10089.08s]  Fixes eyes.
[10089.08s -> 10090.28s]  I don't know if I want to.
[10090.92s -> 10093.36s]  I feel like I want it like this.
[10093.36s -> 10094.08s]  For some reason.
[10104.12s -> 10105.24s]  No, they're better out.
[10105.24s -> 10116.06s]  Oh, shit.
[10116.06s -> 10117.10s]  I fucked it all up.
[10117.10s -> 10135.42s]  Here we go.
[10135.42s -> 10136.30s]  I like it like that.
[10136.30s -> 10137.02s]  I like it the way it is.
[10137.58s -> 10145.08s]  Let's go with...
[10145.72s -> 10148.92s]  Well, elephant doesn't wear clothes.
[10148.92s -> 10160.78s]  Can I make them go down on all fours?
[10165.68s -> 10168.56s]  There's got to be a jokey feet, right?
[10168.56s -> 10174.59s]  Come on.
[10174.59s -> 10175.71s]  You got to have something strange,
[10175.71s -> 10177.55s]  like a goofball outfit down here.
[10177.55s -> 10197.08s]  It's nothing at all.
[10197.08s -> 10198.97s]  I mean, you got clown shoes,
[10198.97s -> 10199.61s]  but you don't have...
[10200.92s -> 10205.98s]  You got Pac-Man feet.
[10205.98s -> 10206.46s]  Wait, aren't...
[10206.46s -> 10210.24s]  Don't elephants have pink feet?
[10210.24s -> 10214.20s]  They do, don't they?
[10214.20s -> 10214.76s]  Yeah, they do.
[10214.76s -> 10215.32s]  Elephants.
[10215.32s -> 10217.24s]  Elephant's feet.
[10226.20s -> 10228.89s]  No, they don't.
[10228.89s -> 10230.49s]  They have like big dinosaur toes.
[10231.13s -> 10232.97s]  They have big dinosaur toenails.
[10232.97s -> 10249.80s]  Definitely going to make the ass bigger.
[10249.80s -> 10251.21s]  All right.
[10251.21s -> 10252.25s]  No, they don't have that.
[10253.05s -> 10253.85s]  All right, that's fine.
[10257.23s -> 10258.75s]  Max's favorite of the household.
[10261.55s -> 10262.11s]  What?
[10262.11s -> 10271.53s]  Fruit don't wear clothes either.
[10271.53s -> 10271.85s]  Uh-huh.
[10271.85s -> 10276.40s]  But yeah, I guess that's better.
[10276.40s -> 10278.88s]  Okay, I'm all right with that.
[10278.88s -> 10280.44s]  And you want to...
[10280.44s -> 10282.20s]  Because they have like three toes.
[10282.20s -> 10283.40s]  So look, it's like one, two...
[10284.84s -> 10286.28s]  That's like a heel.
[10286.28s -> 10286.84s]  You know what I mean?
[10286.84s -> 10288.04s]  That's just pretend that's what it is.
[10294.68s -> 10295.72s]  Fine, I'll give you a t-shirt.
[10302.36s -> 10302.92s]  Yuck.
[10302.92s -> 10311.68s]  No, that just looks like a Saturday morning
[10311.68s -> 10312.80s]  kid's cartoon character.
[10313.44s -> 10313.84s]  Perfect.
[10315.36s -> 10316.40s]  All right, he's an animal.
[10316.96s -> 10318.72s]  So friend to the animals.
[10323.26s -> 10323.74s]  What's the...
[10326.40s -> 10336.22s]  Elephants are like sad, skittish, right?
[10336.22s -> 10336.94s]  They eat a lot.
[10343.52s -> 10347.21s]  Are they vegetarians?
[10347.21s -> 10348.01s]  Yeah, they never forget.
[10351.07s -> 10360.83s]  Dance machine, insider, jealous, loner, hates children, outgoing, a bro.
[10365.20s -> 10366.40s]  Make the elephant a painter.
[10367.13s -> 10368.01s]  A bookworm.
[10368.01s -> 10369.13s]  Okay, a little bookworm.
[10371.31s -> 10372.19s]  Needs a lot of food.
[10373.15s -> 10374.27s]  Uh, no, not a gloomy.
[10374.27s -> 10374.59s]  We'll do...
[10375.55s -> 10387.40s]  Vegetarian, bookworm, and like loves children, right?
[10391.45s -> 10391.77s]  Or...
[10392.49s -> 10394.43s]  What should the last one be?
[10395.23s -> 10397.39s]  No, no, not hates children.
[10397.95s -> 10405.77s]  Where...
[10405.77s -> 10411.12s]  No, just hates children.
[10411.68s -> 10416.97s]  Just make them...
[10416.97s -> 10417.85s]  Make it smart, okay.
[10419.24s -> 10420.36s]  Loves to hate children.
[10420.36s -> 10421.56s]  All right, is this house ready to go?
[10422.12s -> 10423.58s]  I think we're ready to go.
[10423.58s -> 10424.94s]  We've got all our dickheads.
[10425.50s -> 10427.53s]  I need one more animal.
[10427.53s -> 10428.33s]  One more animal.
[10428.33s -> 10430.54s]  Final animal.
[10430.54s -> 10431.34s]  Cat.
[10431.34s -> 10443.32s]  All right, bolognese.
[10443.88s -> 10444.60s]  What's ba...
[10444.60s -> 10445.80s]  Uh, how do I pick breed?
[10454.28s -> 10456.83s]  No, breed.
[10456.83s -> 10457.63s]  Head shape.
[10457.63s -> 10458.03s]  Where is it?
[10458.89s -> 10459.77s]  All right, I just missed it.
[10460.65s -> 10461.29s]  Get deleted.
[10462.01s -> 10468.04s]  All right, hold on.
[10468.04s -> 10468.44s]  Let's have...
[10468.44s -> 10469.64s]  Breed, breed, breed, breed, breed.
[10469.64s -> 10475.60s]  I want a cat with a very, very small head.
[10488.19s -> 10489.63s]  Like a big ass neck.
[10490.78s -> 10494.20s]  Mm-mm.
[10494.20s -> 10495.48s]  Oh, boy.
[10495.48s -> 10497.82s]  All right, I'm gonna...
[10497.82s -> 10499.82s]  Should I make one of the human skin cats?
[10499.82s -> 10521.12s]  Let's get in there.
[10521.12s -> 10543.10s]  No, I don't want you to be like eyes crossed.
[10543.66s -> 10564.44s]  I'm turning this cat into a dog.
[10564.44s -> 10566.17s]  It's just a dog.
[10566.17s -> 10566.49s]  Not...
[10566.49s -> 10567.45s]  Hold on, not yet.
[10567.45s -> 10574.20s]  I like that, though.
[10574.20s -> 10585.02s]  Yeah, big, thick neck.
[10585.02s -> 10592.68s]  Now, you guys...
[10592.68s -> 10593.56s]  I don't think you guys got it right.
[10593.56s -> 10595.56s]  This is the statue gargoyle things
[10595.56s -> 10607.18s]  from the first Ghostbusters movie.
[10607.18s -> 10608.38s]  How big is this thing?
[10608.38s -> 10615.50s]  Tail...
[10615.50s -> 10616.46s]  Tail big.
[10616.46s -> 10620.84s]  All right, looking good.
[10620.84s -> 10623.56s]  That's good.
[10623.56s -> 10624.68s]  A little bit bigger.
[10624.68s -> 10626.20s]  Make the neck a little longer.
[10626.20s -> 10634.19s]  Oh, I didn't do...
[10634.19s -> 10634.99s]  Uh...
[10634.99s -> 10636.01s]  Fluffy.
[10636.01s -> 10636.49s]  No.
[10636.49s -> 10637.61s]  Select traits.
[10637.61s -> 10638.96s]  Custodious.
[10641.61s -> 10642.41s]  Territorial.
[10644.03s -> 10644.83s]  Wow.
[10644.83s -> 10645.23s]  Okay.
[10646.86s -> 10649.40s]  And a prowler.
[10649.40s -> 10650.20s]  This is...
[10650.20s -> 10651.00s]  This thing's scaring me.
[10651.00s -> 10651.72s]  I don't like this.
[10668.92s -> 10670.68s]  You're wearing, like, a Dragon Ball Z t-shirt?
[10670.68s -> 10671.48s]  What the fuck is this?
[10677.21s -> 10677.77s]  No.
[10677.77s -> 10678.49s]  Get that off.
[10678.49s -> 10691.48s]  Don't let...
[10691.48s -> 10692.12s]  I hate it.
[10692.12s -> 10706.94s]  Let's go over here.
[10709.55s -> 10710.43s]  Oh, let's see.
[10717.71s -> 10718.51s]  You like fire?
[10718.51s -> 10719.31s]  Like flames?
[10721.00s -> 10722.36s]  Would flames work on the cat?
[10722.36s -> 10722.92s]  Like a car?
[10722.92s -> 10723.88s]  Like a fast car?
[10723.88s -> 10734.64s]  It's not the right color.
[10734.64s -> 10741.40s]  I need a good, like, fire.
[10741.40s -> 10742.04s]  Here we go.
[10742.04s -> 10756.62s]  This is like feathers.
[10756.62s -> 10757.58s]  No, I don't like it.
[10757.58s -> 10759.28s]  This might be better.
[10759.28s -> 10762.60s]  That's a little better.
[10762.60s -> 10763.10s]  No.
[10767.72s -> 10773.90s]  Somebody put paint on a cat.
[10773.90s -> 10779.26s]  Oh, wait.
[10779.26s -> 10779.82s]  Fire.
[10779.82s -> 10781.00s]  Come on.
[10781.00s -> 10781.88s]  Ooh.
[10781.88s -> 10782.60s]  Fire?
[10782.60s -> 10797.44s]  Quite.
[10797.44s -> 10797.84s]  No.
[10797.84s -> 10809.66s]  It's a prehistoric cat.
[10809.66s -> 10812.83s]  It's like stone.
[10812.83s -> 10817.76s]  You guys have seen the Fantastic Four?
[10817.76s -> 10820.44s]  You know that character, The Thing?
[10820.44s -> 10861.53s]  It's like a rock.
[10861.53s -> 10863.98s]  The cat is...
[10863.98s -> 10865.90s]  It's not tire marks.
[10865.90s -> 10867.34s]  It's not tire marks.
[10867.34s -> 10868.62s]  I'm gonna make that clear.
[10868.62s -> 10876.22s]  Dammit.
[10876.22s -> 10877.58s]  Now I have to get rid of these.
[10877.58s -> 10886.51s]  That's so fucking awful.
[10886.51s -> 10898.56s]  I'm not gonna have...
[10898.56s -> 10901.05s]  It is Rumors Cat.
[10901.05s -> 10911.60s]  Ugh.
[10911.60s -> 10913.12s]  No, that's too dark.
[10913.12s -> 10914.40s]  This is too dark.
[10914.40s -> 10936.35s]  This is too dark.
[10936.35s -> 10941.92s]  I don't know if I can do this.
[10941.92s -> 10946.16s]  Ugh.
[10946.16s -> 10946.80s]  No.
[10946.80s -> 10951.26s]  Poor cat.
[10951.26s -> 10952.22s]  No, I can't.
[10952.22s -> 10953.74s]  That's too terrible.
[10953.74s -> 10954.14s]  I...
[10954.14s -> 10960.16s]  Ugh.
[10960.16s -> 10962.28s]  No, that's awful.
[10962.28s -> 10965.56s]  Ugh.
[10965.56s -> 10968.52s]  This is just the shit in the ass all over again from last time.
[10968.52s -> 10974.59s]  All right.
[10974.59s -> 10976.60s]  What if the cat didn't get run over?
[10976.60s -> 10977.88s]  But it's just...
[10977.88s -> 10983.39s]  It's Rumors Cat.
[10983.39s -> 10990.28s]  So he has a certain tattoo.
[10990.28s -> 10991.90s]  That's worse.
[10991.90s -> 10992.94s]  It's not worse.
[10992.94s -> 10996.14s]  He's trying to justify it.
[10996.14s -> 10999.34s]  No, I'm trying to correct my wrong ways.
[10999.34s -> 11008.38s]  It looks too sad.
[11008.38s -> 11008.78s]  I can't.
[11011.26s -> 11022.48s]  It's just a rash.
[11022.48s -> 11026.60s]  Vertical tire marks.
[11026.60s -> 11030.76s]  He ran over the whole cat's whole body.
[11030.76s -> 11043.64s]  This is terrible.
[11043.64s -> 11044.36s]  That's worse.
[11044.36s -> 11045.24s]  It's worse.
[11045.24s -> 11048.96s]  I hate this.
[11049.60s -> 11051.84s]  I hate this, but it's a tattoo.
[11051.84s -> 11056.88s]  Just delete it all.
[11056.88s -> 11069.63s]  We're done.
[11069.63s -> 11071.71s]  Sim5 doesn't even have a name.
[11072.27s -> 11077.24s]  Ugh.
[11077.24s -> 11078.76s]  I don't even know what to call it.
[11078.76s -> 11083.23s]  This cat.
[11083.23s -> 11086.30s]  About nine...
[11086.30s -> 11087.10s]  Uh.
[11087.10s -> 11091.26s]  No, I'm not gonna have it roadkill.
[11091.26s -> 11091.74s]  We...
[11091.74s -> 11095.16s]  I've removed the tire marks.
[11095.16s -> 11096.20s]  Not speed bump.
[11096.20s -> 11100.00s]  You guys are fucking awful.
[11100.00s -> 11101.44s]  You guys are terrible.
[11103.58s -> 11105.02s]  Eight lives.
[11105.02s -> 11108.08s]  Holy shit, you guys are awful.
[11108.08s -> 11122.27s]  Here's the new...
[11122.27s -> 11123.71s]  This is the last family.
[11123.71s -> 11124.43s]  Move them in.
[11128.40s -> 11130.44s]  Carfield.
[11130.44s -> 11131.64s]  There they are.
[11131.64s -> 11133.00s]  This part doesn't even have a name.
[11133.56s -> 11134.64s]  Fuck this guy.
[11134.64s -> 11135.04s]  Who cares?
[11135.04s -> 11135.84s]  What's this guy's name?
[11138.36s -> 11139.00s]  An elephant.
[11144.57s -> 11157.74s]  How's that for a name?
[11157.74s -> 11170.36s]  You ready?
[11170.36s -> 11172.04s]  Oh, the rat needs traits.
[11172.04s -> 11175.15s]  A junta.
[11175.15s -> 11177.24s]  And friendly.
[11177.24s -> 11179.13s]  And a little bit stubborn.
[11179.13s -> 11179.69s]  A little...
[11179.69s -> 11181.76s]  Pretty vocal.
[11181.76s -> 11182.40s]  Trouble maker.
[11182.40s -> 11183.20s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[11183.20s -> 11183.52s]  Trouble...
[11183.52s -> 11184.08s]  Okay.
[11184.16s -> 11187.80s]  We need trouble maker.
[11187.80s -> 11189.37s]  We need...
[11189.37s -> 11190.33s]  Not friendly.
[11190.33s -> 11195.90s]  A hunter.
[11195.90s -> 11196.62s]  Praying at night.
[11196.62s -> 11197.02s]  Stalking.
[11197.02s -> 11198.14s]  Like hunting at night.
[11198.14s -> 11199.84s]  So we got...
[11200.56s -> 11201.44s]  Making trouble.
[11201.44s -> 11201.92s]  Hunting.
[11201.92s -> 11202.32s]  And then...
[11203.58s -> 11204.86s]  Uh, stubborn.
[11204.86s -> 11206.38s]  We want no vocal because they sing.
[11207.26s -> 11215.45s]  You got traits, right?
[11217.10s -> 11217.74s]  Yes.
[11217.74s -> 11218.54s]  Everybody all set?
[11219.26s -> 11221.66s]  Are we ready to start playing the game?
[11222.38s -> 11226.49s]  I don't remember what we made.
[11226.49s -> 11226.73s]  All right.
[11226.73s -> 11227.77s]  I think we're good to go.
[11228.41s -> 11235.48s]  Here we go.
[11235.48s -> 11236.36s]  Welcome to the stream, guys.
[11236.36s -> 11238.04s]  It only took us about three and a half hours to set it up.
[11238.91s -> 11240.35s]  Change the animal voices, you got me?
[11240.91s -> 11244.86s]  How do I do that?
[11261.16s -> 11262.12s]  How do I change his voice?
[11263.58s -> 11264.22s]  Top left.
[11264.22s -> 11264.70s]  Dumbo.
[11271.04s -> 11271.28s]  Tough.
[11272.24s -> 11273.02s]  Too low.
[11273.98s -> 11275.40s]  Deep.
[11275.40s -> 11284.48s]  Let's see if we can get a good one here.
[11284.48s -> 11285.12s]  How's it going?
[11286.43s -> 11286.75s]  Hey.
[11287.39s -> 11288.59s]  Hey, it's me, the giant rat.
[11289.15s -> 11291.76s]  Hey.
[11292.40s -> 11294.12s]  It's pretty good.
[11298.25s -> 11299.05s]  I'm ready.
[11299.05s -> 11302.06s]  Oh, the cat needs it too.
[11302.62s -> 11314.65s]  This is a...
[11314.65s -> 11315.37s]  This is a bird?
[11322.44s -> 11323.72s]  It's gonna stay like that.
[11323.72s -> 11328.91s]  My voice is fine.
[11328.91s -> 11329.39s]  All right.
[11329.39s -> 11330.75s]  Let's play the Sims.
[11331.61s -> 11332.33s]  Four.
[11332.33s -> 11343.48s]  Time to go.
[11343.48s -> 11345.32s]  We're gonna be saving frequently.
[11345.32s -> 11349.69s]  The tutorial just ended.
[11349.69s -> 11350.89s]  We need a place for them to move.
[11364.59s -> 11366.20s]  I like this one.
[11372.25s -> 11373.05s]  That's perfect.
[11373.05s -> 11373.53s]  I like it.
[11374.94s -> 11380.76s]  You look just scary in every single photo.
[11380.76s -> 11383.42s]  New cool 3D world.
[11383.42s -> 11389.02s]  So in here, we have the fruits, then Mr. Lobo.
[11390.28s -> 11395.79s]  You've also got the Reinhardt family, and then the gnome.
[11399.87s -> 11400.43s]  So where...
[11400.43s -> 11401.71s]  I need three bedrooms?
[11402.27s -> 11405.90s]  28 grand.
[11405.90s -> 11406.62s]  Could go here.
[11406.62s -> 11407.58s]  How many bedrooms are in here?
[11408.40s -> 11408.72s]  Two.
[11408.72s -> 11410.88s]  This lives right next to the gnome.
[11412.28s -> 11413.00s]  Two beds.
[11413.00s -> 11413.56s]  Two beds.
[11413.56s -> 11414.92s]  I can throw another bed in there.
[11414.92s -> 11415.48s]  Who cares?
[11416.12s -> 11422.04s]  This one's a little bigger.
[11425.71s -> 11427.63s]  You do not want to be next to the gnome.
[11428.73s -> 11429.45s]  No, I don't.
[11429.45s -> 11431.80s]  But I think it'll be okay.
[11432.52s -> 11437.85s]  Take a pee break?
[11438.88s -> 11439.44s]  Yeah, all right.
[11439.44s -> 11440.40s]  You know, it's been three hours.
[11440.40s -> 11441.20s]  I'm gonna grab a drink.
[11443.02s -> 11446.62s]  We're going probably all night just to let you guys know.
[11456.12s -> 11457.32s]  So go take a piss.
[11458.04s -> 11462.32s]  I'm gonna grab a drink, and I'll see you guys for a probably
[11462.32s -> 11464.32s]  straight night that's gonna be for at least another four or five hours.
[11464.96s -> 11466.28s]  Be right back.
[11466.28s -> 11704.00s]  All right, let's get this show on the road.
[11709.63s -> 11715.84s]  Thank you for hanging out in the creation of the three or four families here.
[11716.48s -> 11718.03s]  All the mods are go.
[11718.59s -> 11724.78s]  Let's do it.
[11724.78s -> 11731.36s]  So who do we want to play with first?
[11732.00s -> 11734.72s]  I need to save the game, first of all.
[11741.48s -> 11741.96s]  It begins.
[11742.52s -> 11752.38s]  Whoever's gonna die the fastest.
[11752.38s -> 11754.70s]  I think we have to start with the Reinhardts.
[11754.70s -> 11756.41s]  It makes the most sense.
[11760.84s -> 11762.52s]  Reality can be whatever I want.
[11765.64s -> 11767.72s]  1,800 second slow vote.
[11769.93s -> 11770.89s]  Holy shit.
[11771.53s -> 11773.92s]  This is where we're going.
[11773.92s -> 11775.44s]  I'm gonna put another bed in here.
[11775.44s -> 11779.52s]  It's a little small, but it needs TLC.
[11779.52s -> 11780.64s]  Somebody said don't do that.
[11780.64s -> 11784.16s]  Lively neighbors that make sense because the drug-dealing gnome is over here.
[11791.95s -> 11792.35s]  Let's see.
[11792.35s -> 11792.99s]  What's in here?
[11797.00s -> 11798.36s]  No, this place is too expensive.
[11798.92s -> 11803.08s]  I can't afford the pool.
[11803.64s -> 11805.37s]  What's in here?
[11807.68s -> 11808.16s]  All right.
[11808.16s -> 11809.68s]  I didn't kill these people?
[11809.68s -> 11810.48s]  No, I didn't save it.
[11810.48s -> 11811.68s]  Okay, this is a party place.
[11812.32s -> 11813.69s]  We'll go downstairs.
[11814.25s -> 11815.37s]  This is a quake zone.
[11815.37s -> 11816.01s]  What does that mean?
[11816.01s -> 11816.73s]  Quake zone.
[11820.16s -> 11820.48s]  Oh, no.
[11820.48s -> 11821.60s]  Okay, right, right, right.
[11821.60s -> 11824.67s]  I'm gonna do this free real estate cheat thing.
[11825.23s -> 11827.08s]  I have to be in a game for that to happen though, right?
[11835.36s -> 11836.48s]  Not, I don't for this, do I?
[11837.04s -> 11837.92s]  Didn't I try this last time?
[11849.66s -> 11850.30s]  All right, here we go.
[11851.02s -> 11851.82s]  All right, let's do it.
[11853.61s -> 11857.85s]  Let's move downstairs underneath that, those people, those partiers.
[11858.41s -> 11862.44s]  Where was that over here?
[11862.44s -> 11865.02s]  All right, this two-bedroom, two-bath.
[11866.49s -> 11868.81s]  We live underneath the karaoke legends.
[11871.82s -> 11872.30s]  Move on in.
[11874.83s -> 11875.47s]  Fully furnished.
[11875.47s -> 11875.87s]  I'll take it.
[11880.08s -> 11881.12s]  Okay, we're gonna take it slow.
[11882.94s -> 11886.41s]  I am going to have two bedrooms with three people.
[11886.41s -> 11886.97s]  Yeah, that's fine.
[11887.61s -> 11891.26s]  All right, here we go.
[11893.10s -> 11894.30s]  Game starts now.
[11898.62s -> 11899.98s]  That is such a tiny dog.
[11900.94s -> 11901.42s]  What's wrong?
[11901.98s -> 11905.36s]  Acquired the comedy skill.
[11905.36s -> 11906.32s]  Didn't even have to do anything.
[11907.44s -> 11908.80s]  We all go right for the TV.
[11911.52s -> 11912.24s]  Get off the table.
[11912.24s -> 11912.96s]  Get off the table.
[11915.23s -> 11916.99s]  We all went immediately to the TV.
[11917.71s -> 11923.66s]  And so let's do my perspective.
[11924.68s -> 11928.56s]  I watch and think America's got talent.
[11931.98s -> 11932.94s]  Quick, run him over.
[11933.66s -> 11934.62s]  I'm not gonna do...
[11934.62s -> 11935.42s]  No.
[11935.42s -> 11936.46s]  Why does it say first to die?
[11936.46s -> 11937.82s]  Oh, that's the person's name.
[11939.66s -> 11940.46s]  He's still at it.
[11942.46s -> 11943.92s]  Let's interact.
[11945.04s -> 11946.96s]  Play with the laser pointer with the cat.
[11950.28s -> 11951.72s]  No, I'm not killing anybody yet.
[11954.70s -> 11955.18s]  Go get it.
[11958.28s -> 11959.72s]  That rat just doesn't shut up, huh?
[11959.72s -> 11964.06s]  No.
[11964.06s -> 11964.94s]  No car joke.
[11964.94s -> 11966.22s]  I'm not doing that yet.
[11966.22s -> 11967.74s]  We can't just go to a thousand.
[11973.55s -> 11974.03s]  Let's see.
[11974.03s -> 11974.67s]  What's going to do?
[11976.43s -> 11977.39s]  What's going to do with the cat?
[11978.94s -> 11979.42s]  Pick up.
[11980.54s -> 11981.42s]  You can pick up the cat.
[11981.42s -> 11982.30s]  I could pick him up?
[11989.61s -> 11992.75s]  How do I get out?
[11992.75s -> 11993.55s]  I guess I can just do this.
[11997.47s -> 11999.88s]  All right, let's see.
[12000.60s -> 12001.96s]  You can actually pick the cats up.
[12001.96s -> 12002.68s]  I didn't even know that.
[12011.66s -> 12011.98s]  Guys.
[12017.37s -> 12018.81s]  I can stalk the cat.
[12019.69s -> 12024.17s]  Why would I do that?
[12024.17s -> 12024.81s]  I'm not going to do that.
[12025.53s -> 12026.68s]  Here's the thing, though.
[12028.60s -> 12029.80s]  I can use...
[12032.12s -> 12034.20s]  I can move around with the animals.
[12035.96s -> 12043.55s]  Remember this?
[12044.35s -> 12046.76s]  I'm going to be nice to the cat.
[12046.76s -> 12048.04s]  Look, I'm holding the cat and hit no.
[12048.04s -> 12049.08s]  Okay, now just get picked up.
[12052.09s -> 12052.73s]  More choices.
[12052.73s -> 12053.93s]  We got drugs.
[12056.57s -> 12060.67s]  Not doing these yet, but I can't control the animals.
[12061.31s -> 12065.32s]  Yeah, get a spot right on the sofa.
[12066.52s -> 12070.52s]  Oh, also, we can't go right into this yet,
[12070.52s -> 12072.92s]  but any object of the whole game can be worn as a hat.
[12073.96s -> 12077.00s]  Just throwing that out there in case anybody was wondering.
[12084.22s -> 12085.26s]  Let's see here.
[12085.26s -> 12085.82s]  What was in here?
[12087.72s -> 12089.40s]  All right, can we do something as a group?
[12095.66s -> 12097.18s]  What do I want to do for them?
[12097.18s -> 12099.34s]  What do I want to actually do with the characters?
[12099.34s -> 12100.86s]  I got to make like a decision here.
[12102.70s -> 12103.58s]  Pet obsessions.
[12106.22s -> 12106.94s]  Oh, we have...
[12106.94s -> 12107.66s]  Here we go, here we go.
[12108.62s -> 12110.64s]  Do they like cats?
[12117.50s -> 12118.78s]  Welcome to the neighborhood.
[12118.78s -> 12119.98s]  The cat is about to greet them.
[12131.04s -> 12131.52s]  Is that it?
[12147.28s -> 12148.00s]  No, no.
[12148.00s -> 12149.28s]  Who is this lady?
[12152.20s -> 12152.44s]  Whoa!
[12155.40s -> 12157.00s]  Oh, sorry, my little shit cat.
[12157.00s -> 12157.96s]  My cat's an asshole.
[12157.96s -> 12158.84s]  Hold on.
[12158.84s -> 12160.75s]  Come on in.
[12160.75s -> 12161.55s]  Let's have some fun.
[12161.55s -> 12162.03s]  Come on in.
[12162.67s -> 12163.23s]  Both of you.
[12163.79s -> 12168.40s]  They're relatively normal.
[12168.96s -> 12170.80s]  That's sort of.
[12173.29s -> 12174.17s]  What do you have in your hand?
[12175.37s -> 12176.81s]  Oh, I forgot that you like reading.
[12177.69s -> 12181.24s]  Can somebody get the door?
[12181.88s -> 12184.36s]  Somebody get the door.
[12184.36s -> 12185.96s]  You're just watching TV to get a stop.
[12192.22s -> 12195.37s]  She just looks like a fish.
[12196.09s -> 12197.53s]  Oh, you like red cars.
[12197.53s -> 12198.09s]  Do you?
[12198.09s -> 12198.59s]  Uh-oh.
[12203.37s -> 12203.77s]  It's funny.
[12203.77s -> 12205.13s]  You say that you like red cars.
[12211.29s -> 12211.93s]  All right, hold on.
[12211.93s -> 12212.65s]  More choices.
[12212.65s -> 12213.15s]  Drugs.
[12217.45s -> 12218.33s]  This is the drug dealer.
[12218.33s -> 12219.69s]  I got to make friends with this guy.
[12221.42s -> 12223.10s]  We're getting some fucking drugs in this house.
[12224.06s -> 12224.86s]  I'll take care of this.
[12225.98s -> 12226.78s]  What, am I frayed?
[12228.62s -> 12229.26s]  All right, go here.
[12232.48s -> 12233.20s]  Yeah, there's a gnome.
[12234.00s -> 12235.92s]  Jeremy just became friends with the giant rat.
[12235.92s -> 12236.48s]  Yes, we did.
[12239.26s -> 12239.98s]  All right, head out here.
[12239.98s -> 12241.10s]  I need to get like a good view of this.
[12246.04s -> 12247.32s]  All right, greet new neighbor.
[12250.12s -> 12250.62s]  Benio.
[12254.12s -> 12255.32s]  Just as the prophecy.
[12256.28s -> 12256.92s]  There you are.
[12257.48s -> 12258.60s]  Glad we got a chance to chat.
[12259.64s -> 12260.59s]  Yeah, you and I.
[12261.71s -> 12263.07s]  Impishly Pester.
[12263.07s -> 12264.27s]  Bye, weed.
[12265.23s -> 12266.59s]  Discuss current drug.
[12266.59s -> 12268.83s]  Hey, it's really nice to meet you.
[12268.83s -> 12269.79s]  It's really interesting.
[12269.79s -> 12271.55s]  By the way, what's the current drug market?
[12271.55s -> 12273.39s]  Brand new neighbor I haven't even said hello to.
[12274.91s -> 12277.55s]  Buy MDMA pills.
[12277.55s -> 12278.99s]  All right, we're going to buy MDMA.
[12280.03s -> 12280.67s]  Is this illegal?
[12285.61s -> 12286.97s]  Just in front of everybody.
[12288.89s -> 12289.53s]  Who the fuck are you?
[12291.37s -> 12292.41s]  Who is this person?
[12293.21s -> 12294.73s]  Where am I going?
[12297.71s -> 12298.75s]  Oh, you made scrambled eggs?
[12299.39s -> 12302.20s]  What am I doing?
[12306.01s -> 12307.77s]  Am I cooking the MDMA?
[12308.73s -> 12312.59s]  This just looks like VR chat.
[12313.31s -> 12318.59s]  I'm sure I haven't taken them already.
[12318.59s -> 12319.55s]  Did I take the drugs?
[12320.80s -> 12322.08s]  I'm going to go out the window?
[12322.08s -> 12329.24s]  No, no, not yet.
[12329.24s -> 12330.12s]  Not yet.
[12330.12s -> 12330.76s]  That's illegal.
[12335.98s -> 12337.74s]  Oh, I'm cycling through people.
[12337.74s -> 12338.30s]  Okay, I get it.
[12338.86s -> 12347.08s]  How do I put this down?
[12347.08s -> 12353.80s]  What are we following?
[12354.52s -> 12356.86s]  All right, hold on a second.
[12356.86s -> 12357.82s]  Let me get back up here.
[12365.04s -> 12365.84s]  I think it's because I'm eating.
[12369.28s -> 12369.60s]  Open.
[12374.40s -> 12375.04s]  Oh, shit.
[12375.04s -> 12376.24s]  Okay, I have a lot of them here.
[12376.88s -> 12384.08s]  I got high quality pink disco biscuit.
[12386.36s -> 12388.04s]  Kick every party up.
[12390.67s -> 12392.75s]  No pet is truly fearless, even eight.
[12392.75s -> 12394.19s]  Each pet has its own unique fears.
[12394.19s -> 12394.67s]  What do you mean?
[12394.67s -> 12395.15s]  What's going on?
[12398.03s -> 12398.99s]  What are you afraid of?
[12399.63s -> 12402.03s]  He's just mashing controls and scaring my cat.
[12403.29s -> 12404.09s]  Can you cut the shit?
[12404.73s -> 12417.21s]  All right, let's put these back on the table here.
[12419.77s -> 12420.81s]  Uh, let's just take one.
[12429.44s -> 12429.92s]  He's in mine.
[12429.92s -> 12430.80s]  I'm the only one that's gonna take.
[12434.04s -> 12434.68s]  What does this do?
[12450.24s -> 12457.10s]  Well, I mean, you didn't even take drugs when you're in here.
[12457.66s -> 12460.94s]  Rumor is busting some moves.
[12460.94s -> 12462.38s]  He has unlocked some new dance moves
[12462.38s -> 12464.30s]  that can now show off the arm charm.
[12464.94s -> 12469.72s]  Let me teach you about a dance.
[12471.44s -> 12472.88s]  What the fuck is that move?
[12489.23s -> 12491.07s]  Well, then I can work for money.
[12492.94s -> 12493.82s]  Who's going to pay me?
[12503.26s -> 12505.60s]  Who's going to pay me though?
[12505.60s -> 12506.64s]  That's what I'm curious about.
[12507.44s -> 12508.72s]  Forget about teaching dancing.
[12508.72s -> 12509.84s]  I want to know who's going to pay.
[12522.76s -> 12523.96s]  That's not very good.
[12526.12s -> 12528.20s]  The gnome just gave me 500 bucks.
[12533.05s -> 12533.69s]  What did you start with?
[12533.69s -> 12534.89s]  These like trading cards?
[12539.53s -> 12540.65s]  The life of a streamer.
[12542.72s -> 12544.08s]  Anybody have any donations?
[12544.88s -> 12545.44s]  Anybody?
[12554.41s -> 12555.13s]  Did I just dab?
[12555.13s -> 12556.01s]  Oh god, I dabbed.
[12556.01s -> 12557.21s]  Here, buy weed.
[12557.77s -> 12558.97s]  Buy a Ziploc bat.
[12558.97s -> 12560.33s]  Ask about drug quality.
[12570.38s -> 12572.06s]  No, no, no, that's...
[12573.32s -> 12575.08s]  I don't want to eat the whole bag of Doritos.
[12575.64s -> 12577.47s]  All right, stop this.
[12578.11s -> 12580.94s]  What do you think, chat?
[12581.58s -> 12588.73s]  I'm going to discuss the current drug market.
[12589.29s -> 12591.47s]  All right, stop twerking.
[12597.85s -> 12598.97s]  Nobody wants to eat the whole bag,
[12598.97s -> 12599.45s]  but everybody does.
[12599.45s -> 12600.01s]  That's what I'm saying.
[12603.45s -> 12605.29s]  If I dial this up to a thousand right now,
[12605.29s -> 12607.61s]  the whole stream is going to go just derail
[12607.61s -> 12608.41s]  and you know what happens.
[12609.05s -> 12610.16s]  Thanks for hanging out.
[12610.16s -> 12610.72s]  See you later.
[12610.72s -> 12612.40s]  Well, at least I got your phone number.
[12612.40s -> 12614.51s]  Is anybody else still in here?
[12619.85s -> 12620.57s]  Instagram?
[12622.40s -> 12623.04s]  Send?
[12623.04s -> 12623.84s]  What else is here?
[12623.84s -> 12626.44s]  Leash pet training.
[12627.90s -> 12628.86s]  Friendly pet care.
[12631.21s -> 12631.85s]  Give a bath.
[12632.57s -> 12641.07s]  I thought he was leaving.
[12648.16s -> 12649.44s]  More drugs than twerk.
[12650.24s -> 12652.68s]  I'm supposed to be taking my dog out for a walk.
[12661.42s -> 12664.73s]  Oh, talk about the warm temperature.
[12664.73s -> 12665.85s]  Joke about politics.
[12667.93s -> 12668.73s]  Where am I going?
[12671.29s -> 12672.57s]  Oh, it's time for a bath.
[12673.21s -> 12674.78s]  I know you're tired,
[12674.78s -> 12678.78s]  but it's time for you to get some clean bath time.
[12683.04s -> 12683.60s]  What?
[12683.60s -> 12685.42s]  Were you just trying...
[12685.42s -> 12686.06s]  Was he talking?
[12686.62s -> 12695.12s]  Where do you give the dog a bath?
[12701.52s -> 12702.80s]  Do a rat cam?
[12702.80s -> 12703.12s]  Okay.
[12720.28s -> 12721.64s]  Look at how fucked up I look.
[12722.36s -> 12724.91s]  Did I just put my hand up and grab him?
[12724.91s -> 12726.11s]  I just like high-fived him.
[12727.71s -> 12728.51s]  Oh, that's my hand.
[12729.63s -> 12730.13s]  Okay.
[12734.28s -> 12734.68s]  All right.
[12734.68s -> 12735.48s]  Thank you.
[12735.48s -> 12736.12s]  I appreciate it.
[12738.12s -> 12739.56s]  Oh, I'm shaking around.
[12739.56s -> 12740.44s]  The life of a dog.
[12742.89s -> 12743.45s]  What is he doing?
[12757.36s -> 12758.72s]  He's taking more drugs.
[12760.32s -> 12760.88s]  What do you...
[12760.88s -> 12761.76s]  Oh, I'm just gonna leave.
[12763.21s -> 12763.53s]  Bye.
[12764.83s -> 12765.79s]  No, don't just leave.
[12765.79s -> 12766.35s]  Go back.
[12766.35s -> 12766.75s]  Go back.
[12766.75s -> 12767.15s]  Go back.
[12767.15s -> 12767.87s]  Where are you going?
[12768.75s -> 12769.87s]  No, you don't just leave him.
[12770.59s -> 12773.42s]  I'm sick of this shit.
[12773.42s -> 12777.98s]  Oh, he used to go outside.
[12777.98s -> 12778.70s]  He used to go outside.
[12779.26s -> 12782.24s]  Take your dog out.
[12783.28s -> 12786.17s]  I thought that was another animal in the house.
[12786.97s -> 12788.01s]  No, it's just one of my roommates.
[12789.29s -> 12790.17s]  No, he's still here.
[12805.53s -> 12806.65s]  I need to feed the dog.
[12806.65s -> 12808.01s]  I need to feed the animals.
[12808.01s -> 12808.41s]  Where are...
[12808.41s -> 12809.05s]  Where's the cat?
[12810.84s -> 12812.28s]  Oh, they're fighting for food now.
[12812.28s -> 12812.52s]  All right.
[12812.52s -> 12812.76s]  Hold on.
[12812.76s -> 12813.72s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[12820.11s -> 12820.75s]  Pet talk.
[12821.55s -> 12825.98s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[12826.54s -> 12828.06s]  Where are they going?
[12832.91s -> 12834.51s]  Why are they out here by themselves?
[12834.51s -> 12840.25s]  I don't even know where he is.
[12840.81s -> 12848.06s]  He just went out on his own.
[12854.52s -> 12854.92s]  Okay.
[12855.48s -> 12858.70s]  Where's the cat?
[12865.04s -> 12865.68s]  Who are...
[12865.68s -> 12866.48s]  Oh, it's tomato.
[12866.48s -> 12866.80s]  It's the...
[12866.80s -> 12867.68s]  No, not tomato.
[12867.68s -> 12868.64s]  It's the apple.
[12868.64s -> 12872.17s]  This is the cat's point of view.
[12872.17s -> 12881.66s]  Did I throw a knife around?
[12887.42s -> 12888.62s]  I didn't know how I got out here.
[12890.01s -> 12890.41s]  Trash.
[12890.97s -> 12892.32s]  Playing the trash.
[12906.38s -> 12907.10s]  What?
[12907.10s -> 12908.14s]  The cat take drugs?
[12914.48s -> 12915.92s]  The cat's tripping up.
[12916.56s -> 12917.92s]  No, that's not good.
[12917.92s -> 12919.12s]  No, it's because I scrolled out.
[12919.76s -> 12926.09s]  Oh, I'm like just out here now.
[12926.09s -> 12953.58s]  Wait, why did they get so dirty?
[12963.10s -> 12963.98s]  That's pee?
[12963.98s -> 12965.10s]  That's a shitload of pee.
[12966.06s -> 12972.33s]  No, he took a picture of himself.
[12972.33s -> 12978.44s]  What is tornadoes?
[12982.76s -> 12983.72s]  I've done that before.
[12989.58s -> 12990.62s]  I should really get going now.
[12990.62s -> 12991.18s]  See you later.
[12991.18s -> 12991.90s]  Well, okay.
[12991.90s -> 12993.18s]  How do I get the cat to come back?
[12993.82s -> 12996.88s]  Where's the cat?
[12997.92s -> 13001.13s]  Am I ordering food?
[13001.85s -> 13007.07s]  Wait a minute.
[13015.20s -> 13016.24s]  Yibsbadeesh.
[13016.24s -> 13019.44s]  Barovay Senzin Dumbayakalo.
[13019.44s -> 13024.12s]  I should be able to...
[13024.12s -> 13024.92s]  If this guy dies...
[13026.28s -> 13033.29s]  Can I just go in now?
[13040.84s -> 13041.80s]  That's how it is, bro.
[13042.36s -> 13042.92s]  Finally.
[13054.35s -> 13057.34s]  Finally.
[13057.34s -> 13057.98s]  Finally.
[13064.20s -> 13066.60s]  You've been waiting all day for that.
[13069.29s -> 13070.17s]  Who's gonna run...
[13070.17s -> 13071.69s]  Who's gonna run the popcorn stand?
[13074.17s -> 13074.81s]  Go home.
[13076.73s -> 13077.53s]  I will feed you.
[13080.54s -> 13082.22s]  The music still is just blasting.
[13083.93s -> 13084.25s]  All right.
[13084.25s -> 13084.65s]  Get up.
[13085.90s -> 13086.30s]  Claim.
[13086.86s -> 13088.80s]  What do you mean claim?
[13092.76s -> 13093.80s]  Where's my window?
[13095.53s -> 13096.01s]  Skills?
[13096.81s -> 13098.33s]  No, where's my attitude?
[13098.33s -> 13098.97s]  Okay, there we go.
[13099.90s -> 13100.62s]  Join a club.
[13101.52s -> 13102.40s]  Own a business.
[13103.36s -> 13104.92s]  Buy a vet clinic?
[13104.92s -> 13105.08s]  No.
[13105.64s -> 13106.52s]  All right.
[13106.52s -> 13107.56s]  My hunger, everything's fine.
[13107.56s -> 13108.28s]  My sleep is all right.
[13108.28s -> 13109.08s]  Let's speed it up a little.
[13116.56s -> 13116.80s]  Okay.
[13118.32s -> 13120.00s]  I need to get a pet bowl, first of all.
[13121.74s -> 13122.22s]  Finally.
[13124.28s -> 13125.00s]  That's so funny.
[13126.48s -> 13126.88s]  All right.
[13126.88s -> 13127.36s]  Pet bowl.
[13134.70s -> 13136.54s]  I'm gonna say it's probably...
[13137.34s -> 13140.41s]  It's like a pet option.
[13141.29s -> 13141.93s]  Kid's room.
[13142.81s -> 13143.53s]  Miscellaneous.
[13145.47s -> 13146.03s]  Kitchen.
[13146.03s -> 13146.75s]  I wonder what would it...
[13146.75s -> 13147.55s]  What would it be under?
[13147.55s -> 13148.27s]  I feel like a bowl.
[13148.27s -> 13148.99s]  Like a pet bowl.
[13149.71s -> 13155.77s]  It's like just pet.
[13157.34s -> 13158.38s]  Pet food bowl.
[13159.48s -> 13160.20s]  Hey, look at that.
[13160.20s -> 13160.60s]  All right.
[13160.60s -> 13161.56s]  Bow wow chow.
[13163.10s -> 13164.70s]  Let's get the automatic one.
[13164.70s -> 13172.84s]  How do I move it?
[13172.84s -> 13179.53s]  Let's hit the spin button.
[13179.53s -> 13179.85s]  Alt.
[13180.41s -> 13181.05s]  Control.
[13181.05s -> 13181.45s]  Shift.
[13182.25s -> 13182.57s]  Hold.
[13187.12s -> 13187.84s]  How many of these do I need?
[13187.84s -> 13188.40s]  Just two?
[13190.76s -> 13191.24s]  Pet mate.
[13192.04s -> 13192.76s]  Just two of them.
[13193.66s -> 13194.62s]  Somebody said R.
[13194.62s -> 13195.50s]  I can't...
[13195.50s -> 13196.30s]  R doesn't do anything.
[13197.02s -> 13199.79s]  Oh, there you go.
[13205.53s -> 13205.85s]  Okay.
[13206.49s -> 13207.87s]  So that's good.
[13207.87s -> 13208.19s]  Pet.
[13208.19s -> 13208.99s]  Pet toys.
[13211.58s -> 13212.14s]  Good to go.
[13212.86s -> 13214.56s]  Fill them up.
[13215.36s -> 13215.60s]  Fill.
[13216.56s -> 13216.88s]  Fill.
[13216.88s -> 13217.68s]  They'd both be good.
[13221.88s -> 13222.92s]  I had to wake up for this,
[13222.92s -> 13223.96s]  but somebody had to do it.
[13229.21s -> 13230.97s]  Why is your sim more handsome than you?
[13230.97s -> 13231.77s]  It's unrealistic.
[13232.41s -> 13234.86s]  Ban that guy for five seconds, please.
[13235.42s -> 13238.59s]  All right.
[13238.59s -> 13239.47s]  What am I doing on this?
[13239.47s -> 13240.19s]  Is this a computer?
[13240.19s -> 13241.47s]  I thought this was like a toaster oven.
[13242.86s -> 13243.66s]  Write jokes.
[13245.34s -> 13246.22s]  Web order.
[13248.12s -> 13249.08s]  Purchase crackers.
[13249.08s -> 13249.80s]  Purchase medicine.
[13249.80s -> 13250.76s]  Purchase fireworks.
[13253.13s -> 13254.65s]  I can buy drugs on here?
[13255.29s -> 13263.07s]  Okay.
[13263.07s -> 13265.07s]  I'm buying drugs online.
[13266.60s -> 13267.80s]  Uninstall origin.
[13269.79s -> 13270.11s]  All right.
[13273.48s -> 13273.64s]  All right.
[13273.64s -> 13274.04s]  Here we go.
[13276.48s -> 13277.28s]  Vaporizer.
[13278.00s -> 13278.96s]  Fill these packs.
[13278.96s -> 13279.84s]  Smoking papers.
[13279.84s -> 13280.40s]  Weed bung.
[13281.04s -> 13282.24s]  That's all you got, huh?
[13282.88s -> 13284.36s]  I'll take one of each.
[13284.36s -> 13291.93s]  You can stream with the Get Famous DLC.
[13291.93s -> 13293.85s]  Are the dogs and cats still outside?
[13296.32s -> 13297.20s]  You little shit.
[13297.20s -> 13297.76s]  What are you doing?
[13299.88s -> 13300.44s]  Bladder.
[13300.44s -> 13301.80s]  Oh, how do you go to the bathroom?
[13301.80s -> 13303.00s]  Is it like a dog bathroom?
[13303.64s -> 13306.72s]  Oh, I got to walk them.
[13306.72s -> 13307.36s]  Get over here.
[13312.32s -> 13313.12s]  Request song.
[13315.40s -> 13315.96s]  No, no, no.
[13317.32s -> 13317.96s]  Go potty.
[13319.76s -> 13320.40s]  Walk the cat.
[13320.40s -> 13321.20s]  Get up.
[13321.20s -> 13321.68s]  Wake up.
[13322.24s -> 13324.41s]  Where's the cat?
[13324.41s -> 13325.37s]  You walk a cat?
[13325.37s -> 13325.77s]  No, you don't.
[13325.77s -> 13327.37s]  They have like a kitty litter.
[13339.12s -> 13340.16s]  Like cat box.
[13340.72s -> 13341.52s]  Cat condo.
[13341.52s -> 13342.16s]  Cat wand.
[13344.01s -> 13344.81s]  Like glitter?
[13349.15s -> 13350.75s]  Littermatic scoop free.
[13350.75s -> 13351.23s]  Here we go.
[13351.95s -> 13353.02s]  There it is.
[13353.02s -> 13354.06s]  $175.
[13354.06s -> 13354.78s]  Throw it over here.
[13356.27s -> 13357.07s]  Where can I put this?
[13357.71s -> 13363.21s]  There's a good place for this.
[13363.77s -> 13368.97s]  Let me go down a level.
[13368.97s -> 13370.75s]  There we go.
[13370.75s -> 13371.07s]  Okay.
[13371.63s -> 13384.97s]  All right.
[13384.97s -> 13385.77s]  That's good.
[13385.77s -> 13386.89s]  Cat can now go to the bathroom.
[13386.89s -> 13387.69s]  Take the dog out.
[13388.81s -> 13390.25s]  I was going to put it on the kitchen counter.
[13390.25s -> 13390.73s]  Yeah, you're right.
[13394.11s -> 13395.07s]  Take him outside.
[13397.53s -> 13398.89s]  Take the dog outside.
[13398.89s -> 13399.13s]  Now.
[13401.84s -> 13403.36s]  Take dog outside.
[13404.16s -> 13409.12s]  What's going on up here?
[13409.84s -> 13420.49s]  Wait, you can actually eat this?
[13439.63s -> 13440.83s]  Where am I?
[13441.47s -> 13444.19s]  And why have I not taken the dog out like I was supposed to?
[13445.47s -> 13446.91s]  Was I just eating out of the bowl?
[13447.55s -> 13451.37s]  Oh, you asshole.
[13451.37s -> 13451.85s]  Please.
[13457.66s -> 13458.22s]  Where's the dog?
[13461.20s -> 13462.24s]  What is that?
[13462.88s -> 13467.92s]  Did she knock over the bowl or something?
[13469.80s -> 13476.00s]  What is this?
[13476.00s -> 13476.48s]  Is this?
[13485.72s -> 13486.12s]  All right.
[13486.12s -> 13487.24s]  Clean that up.
[13487.24s -> 13488.36s]  I thought it was...
[13488.36s -> 13488.84s]  Mop it up.
[13488.84s -> 13489.96s]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[13489.96s -> 13490.28s]  Stop it.
[13490.28s -> 13490.60s]  Stop it.
[13490.60s -> 13490.92s]  Stop it.
[13490.92s -> 13491.24s]  Stop it.
[13491.24s -> 13491.32s]  Stop it.
[13491.32s -> 13493.13s]  Stop it.
[13493.13s -> 13495.29s]  I thought she knocked the bowl of macaroni and cheese off.
[13495.93s -> 13504.44s]  Stop.
[13506.16s -> 13507.20s]  Now, please.
[13507.20s -> 13507.68s]  If you would.
[13508.54s -> 13515.23s]  Go for a walk.
[13515.23s -> 13515.63s]  Okay.
[13515.63s -> 13516.11s]  Finally.
[13518.20s -> 13519.64s]  Am I still fucked up from drugs?
[13521.74s -> 13522.54s]  Walk time.
[13522.54s -> 13523.02s]  Let's go.
[13527.42s -> 13528.06s]  Finally.
[13528.06s -> 13528.94s]  My god.
[13531.58s -> 13533.02s]  For a second, I thought I could drink up them.
[13536.91s -> 13537.79s]  All right.
[13537.79s -> 13539.23s]  Take dog for a walk.
[13540.76s -> 13545.40s]  Here we go.
[13545.40s -> 13545.96s]  What?
[13545.96s -> 13547.98s]  How did we...
[13547.98s -> 13548.94s]  We got out here really quick.
[13549.76s -> 13550.00s]  All right.
[13550.00s -> 13550.40s]  Go pee.
[13553.63s -> 13555.21s]  We need a new cam.
[13555.77s -> 13589.00s]  Where'd it go?
[13589.00s -> 13589.72s]  Where am I?
[13589.72s -> 13598.97s]  We didn't even get to see it?
[13598.97s -> 13607.82s]  He just deleted himself.
[13607.82s -> 13608.62s]  Okay.
[13608.62s -> 13626.17s]  I was hoping I could get a POV from the dog.
[13626.17s -> 13626.41s]  All right.
[13626.41s -> 13626.89s]  We were here.
[13629.58s -> 13629.82s]  Okay.
[13629.82s -> 13631.18s]  It's time to check on...
[13631.18s -> 13634.72s]  Let's check on the other families here.
[13634.72s -> 13639.15s]  The fruit apartment here.
[13639.15s -> 13641.23s]  Who gives a shit about any of these people?
[13641.79s -> 13644.76s]  I think it's time to start activating fucked up things.
[13644.76s -> 13656.30s]  What are you guys up to?
[13656.86s -> 13657.26s]  Let's see.
[13657.98s -> 13660.81s]  There's Mr. Banana.
[13663.04s -> 13663.52s]  All right.
[13663.52s -> 13664.72s]  Go jogging.
[13664.72s -> 13665.20s]  Let's see.
[13667.13s -> 13667.85s]  Practice singing.
[13668.65s -> 13670.04s]  Mr. Apple.
[13670.76s -> 13673.56s]  Specifically made these...
[13673.56s -> 13678.09s]  This family to just have horrible things happen to them.
[13678.65s -> 13685.29s]  So here's the thing about call over part gangs.
[13686.92s -> 13689.16s]  Enable the Thoughties gang outfit.
[13690.36s -> 13691.56s]  Join the Thoughties.
[13692.28s -> 13694.28s]  Join the Hardwood gang.
[13694.28s -> 13696.52s]  Invite the Thoughties gang to town.
[13698.00s -> 13700.16s]  Invite the Hardwood gang to town.
[13702.67s -> 13704.59s]  This is probably going to be very bad.
[13705.15s -> 13709.47s]  Who the fuck are you?
[13732.16s -> 13733.20s]  Oh, it's the landlord.
[13737.96s -> 13755.04s]  It's so much worse in first person.
[13758.08s -> 13759.44s]  His apartment's up for rent.
[13771.40s -> 13772.12s]  What are you doing?
[13781.96s -> 13784.12s]  Oh, I forgot how fucking stupid this was.
[13786.36s -> 13788.20s]  I just slotted the landlord.
[13788.20s -> 13790.04s]  We're gonna put butter and cheese in here.
[13791.16s -> 13791.72s]  Stir it up.
[13803.24s -> 13804.04s]  The singing.
[13813.58s -> 13815.90s]  Clearly you are a terrible and inconsiderate neighbor.
[13815.90s -> 13817.10s]  You just made a big mistake.
[13817.10s -> 13821.98s]  I will remember this.
[13821.98s -> 13823.34s]  What do you mean you're gonna remember this?
[13826.84s -> 13827.80s]  He's still alive?
[13828.36s -> 13840.12s]  How is it raining inside?
[13853.07s -> 13853.55s]  Gangs.
[13854.83s -> 13857.23s]  Let's add death to the Thoughties gang.
[13858.19s -> 13869.32s]  Okay, death is now a part...
[13869.32s -> 13871.32s]  Oh my god, shut the fuck up.
[13903.29s -> 13905.53s]  I see people like burning on the TV.
[13918.83s -> 13919.95s]  Alright, enough.
[13920.83s -> 13921.87s]  Enough, enough, enough.
[13928.40s -> 13929.92s]  Join the Thoughtie gang.
[13932.08s -> 13933.20s]  Jesus Christ.
[13935.04s -> 13936.16s]  Oh god, wait, he's...
[13936.16s -> 13937.92s]  No, no, no, he's opening fire.
[13939.44s -> 13939.94s]  On who?
[13943.04s -> 13943.54s]  What?
[13975.74s -> 13976.94s]  Infinite ammo.
[13980.06s -> 13981.66s]  Did he kill everyone?
[13983.80s -> 13984.36s]  I've never...
[13984.36s -> 13985.72s]  That's a new addition.
[13986.60s -> 13992.46s]  I gotta restart it.
[13992.46s -> 13994.86s]  A police cruiser has just been dispatched to your location.
[13996.14s -> 13999.15s]  Who's alive?
[14004.11s -> 14005.47s]  Just like AOL.
[14006.03s -> 14025.61s]  What is death from above?
[14026.41s -> 14031.00s]  Death from above?
[14034.60s -> 14041.50s]  How did he die?
[14043.26s -> 14043.76s]  What?
[14044.46s -> 14046.30s]  Why are they coming in and shooting themselves?
[14047.74s -> 14058.33s]  Who's left?
[14064.20s -> 14064.84s]  Back to Reddit.
[14081.42s -> 14082.65s]  What do you mean, ow?
[14083.37s -> 14099.79s]  Let's reopen that.
[14100.59s -> 14105.47s]  Death coming in and twerking.
[14106.11s -> 14108.03s]  Because he was part of the Thoughties.
[14108.03s -> 14108.75s]  Alright, we gotta bring...
[14108.75s -> 14109.79s]  We gotta do a gang thing.
[14110.35s -> 14113.66s]  He typed in explode in the command, in the console command.
[14115.88s -> 14118.20s]  Alright, back in here, let's go.
[14129.53s -> 14134.03s]  Alright, new life here.
[14138.04s -> 14139.88s]  We should go dancing or something.
[14147.36s -> 14148.88s]  No, drink energy juice.
[14149.52s -> 14150.16s]  Go for it, yeah.
[14150.72s -> 14157.84s]  Also, important.
[14158.72s -> 14160.17s]  We may as well see what this does.
[14160.89s -> 14164.09s]  Let me go get it.
[14166.25s -> 14168.65s]  We have not even seen half of the mods that I have.
[14168.65s -> 14173.45s]  We have the genie lamp, which has a genie come out of a lamp and grant wishes.
[14174.25s -> 14179.71s]  We also have a scary horror mirror, so let's go get it.
[14181.39s -> 14181.79s]  Should be...
[14181.79s -> 14182.75s]  I think it's down here.
[14183.47s -> 14186.67s]  It's a lamp, let's try it.
[14189.26s -> 14189.74s]  Where is it?
[14189.74s -> 14191.02s]  Looking for the lamp.
[14191.02s -> 14194.25s]  It's like 10 grand or something, too.
[14194.97s -> 14195.77s]  It's ridiculous.
[14197.42s -> 14197.66s]  Where...
[14197.66s -> 14198.22s]  Here's the...
[14198.22s -> 14200.38s]  Okay, here is the haunted mirror.
[14201.26s -> 14205.26s]  Legend says that a bride was betrayed and murdered on her wedding day,
[14205.26s -> 14218.92s]  and this mirror was the last thing she saw herself before she died.
[14218.92s -> 14221.00s]  Join a club in the bottom right so you get tons of friends.
[14222.80s -> 14224.96s]  Yeah, right now I'm just going through what these things even do.
[14230.24s -> 14231.12s]  There's the haunted mirror.
[14231.68s -> 14234.43s]  Can you filter modded items?
[14234.43s -> 14236.03s]  Um, I'm not sure you can.
[14236.03s -> 14236.99s]  Maybe base work?
[14238.19s -> 14238.91s]  Spa day...
[14240.59s -> 14241.55s]  Nah, you can't.
[14241.55s -> 14243.71s]  Unless I can do it from a different content.
[14243.71s -> 14245.15s]  Let's see, purchase custom content.
[14245.15s -> 14245.55s]  There we go.
[14246.11s -> 14248.72s]  Here is the book of chaos.
[14248.72s -> 14251.12s]  Torture and chaos to those who are unworthy to live.
[14251.92s -> 14253.80s]  Put it down.
[14254.44s -> 14255.88s]  This is a speed package.
[14255.88s -> 14256.84s]  This is the weed bong.
[14256.84s -> 14257.96s]  Oh, who ordered all this?
[14257.96s -> 14258.84s]  Cocaine brick?
[14260.84s -> 14262.12s]  Vintage baseball bat?
[14265.29s -> 14266.49s]  Baby laxatives?
[14269.42s -> 14270.38s]  And there's the genie lamp.
[14270.38s -> 14271.18s]  All right, so let's see.
[14272.14s -> 14272.54s]  I have a...
[14272.54s -> 14274.14s]  Let's just get him out here.
[14278.41s -> 14279.21s]  Rug can stay there.
[14281.10s -> 14287.24s]  And let's go back to live play and let's have the leopard gnome inspect the lamp.
[14292.49s -> 14293.05s]  Let's see what happens.
[14302.01s -> 14302.51s]  Okay.
[14304.33s -> 14304.89s]  So what happened?
[14306.97s -> 14308.41s]  I've rubbed the lamp, but what's going on?
[14309.53s -> 14310.25s]  Oh, shit.
[14310.25s -> 14310.75s]  Okay.
[14311.93s -> 14312.81s]  All right, here's the genie.
[14315.36s -> 14317.60s]  The genie just comes and just watches TV.
[14317.60s -> 14321.58s]  Where are my wishes?
[14322.54s -> 14323.98s]  I just added an NPC to the game.
[14329.87s -> 14330.83s]  Everybody rub the lamp.
[14332.16s -> 14334.64s]  Oh, no, only the leper gnome can now.
[14337.28s -> 14338.16s]  Do I get another genie?
[14338.16s -> 14339.04s]  How many genies do you get?
[14344.60s -> 14345.40s]  Just one genie?
[14347.96s -> 14349.08s]  All right, well, what can you do?
[14349.88s -> 14353.13s]  Friendly introduction.
[14353.69s -> 14358.67s]  Let's start a conversation.
[14365.12s -> 14365.62s]  How are you?
[14367.94s -> 14370.18s]  Have her join the thotties.
[14370.18s -> 14372.10s]  Not everybody has to join the thotties, okay?
[14375.30s -> 14376.50s]  Are we just meeting for the first time?
[14382.18s -> 14383.62s]  Reveal brilliant invention.
[14384.34s -> 14387.18s]  All right, let's flash our crazy eyes.
[14392.48s -> 14393.04s]  She liked it.
[14396.40s -> 14400.43s]  How about ask to hang out?
[14404.59s -> 14413.30s]  I wish this was VR.
[14415.54s -> 14419.60s]  Okay, so I'm getting some real interesting,
[14419.60s -> 14420.96s]  give fake news, ask to hang out,
[14421.84s -> 14423.15s]  asking about the day.
[14429.89s -> 14431.25s]  That's fucking mean.
[14431.25s -> 14432.45s]  Are you trying to make a friend
[14432.45s -> 14433.65s]  and potentially a romantic interest?
[14433.65s -> 14434.61s]  Are you trying to be an asshole?
[14434.61s -> 14435.41s]  What the hell was that?
[14437.17s -> 14444.26s]  Where are you going?
[14444.26s -> 14448.54s]  What are you doing?
[14448.54s -> 14449.98s]  Eat cereal.
[14449.98s -> 14455.06s]  Wow, that's next level.
[14457.02s -> 14458.22s]  Oh, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[14458.22s -> 14459.66s]  I'm going to eat some cereal.
[14459.66s -> 14461.34s]  I'm going to eat some lucky charms.
[14462.14s -> 14469.20s]  All right, can you keep talking?
[14470.86s -> 14472.78s]  All right, let's go with romance.
[14473.76s -> 14474.96s]  Make a flirtatious joke.
[14475.68s -> 14481.81s]  Talk about priorities.
[14486.05s -> 14487.70s]  This guy sucks.
[14488.34s -> 14495.55s]  All right, we got playful.
[14495.55s -> 14496.75s]  And with the bars on his folder,
[14497.47s -> 14498.35s]  by full I mean no.
[14500.51s -> 14501.47s]  Look at the lamp again.
[14504.53s -> 14505.33s]  Inspect the lamp.
[14507.26s -> 14508.46s]  This is his genie.
[14508.46s -> 14509.26s]  Inspect lamp.
[14514.43s -> 14515.47s]  Grandpa's gaming.
[14517.55s -> 14518.35s]  We're having a good time.
[14518.75s -> 14521.42s]  It's a lot of new love.
[14521.42s -> 14522.30s]  The lamp is so dusty,
[14522.30s -> 14523.26s]  I should probably rub it out.
[14523.82s -> 14524.38s]  Oh, God.
[14525.18s -> 14531.76s]  The plum looks like a genie.
[14531.76s -> 14537.20s]  She's following me around.
[14537.76s -> 14539.42s]  I think I made a friend.
[14539.42s -> 14540.70s]  How long does the genie stick around for?
[14541.50s -> 14548.08s]  The genie is going to make the same
[14548.64s -> 14550.16s]  eggs, cheese, and flour dinner.
[14550.80s -> 14553.42s]  All right, more choices.
[14555.09s -> 14555.81s]  Pick up line.
[14555.81s -> 14556.61s]  Ask if single.
[14556.61s -> 14557.65s]  Ask on a date.
[14565.02s -> 14565.66s]  Make a wish.
[14566.22s -> 14568.22s]  Not yet.
[14573.82s -> 14574.46s]  We're going on a date.
[14575.10s -> 14576.14s]  The banana and the genie.
[14576.14s -> 14577.58s]  I'm going on a date right now.
[14578.14s -> 14580.56s]  Remember, the chaos book is missing.
[14580.56s -> 14580.96s]  It's okay.
[14581.52s -> 14583.94s]  Where are we going to go?
[14586.10s -> 14586.98s]  Fashion district.
[14588.56s -> 14589.36s]  Karaoke bar.
[14590.08s -> 14594.45s]  That sounds like fun.
[14595.01s -> 14608.27s]  Okay, here we go.
[14608.27s -> 14609.47s]  We're going on a date with the genie.
[14612.62s -> 14614.22s]  So socialize with your date.
[14614.22s -> 14615.18s]  Sit and talk with your date.
[14616.82s -> 14617.38s]  Socialize.
[14619.22s -> 14619.62s]  How about...
[14620.26s -> 14623.30s]  What are you doing?
[14623.86s -> 14624.67s]  What are you doing?
[14624.67s -> 14624.99s]  What are you doing?
[14624.99s -> 14625.31s]  What are you doing?
[14625.31s -> 14626.03s]  What are you doing?
[14626.03s -> 14626.59s]  What are you doing?
[14626.59s -> 14628.03s]  Why would you leave the date immediately?
[14628.03s -> 14628.67s]  What's wrong with you?
[14629.31s -> 14631.84s]  You got an other worldly being.
[14634.29s -> 14634.77s]  Romance.
[14634.77s -> 14635.09s]  Romance.
[14635.09s -> 14635.57s]  Romance.
[14635.57s -> 14635.97s]  Flirt.
[14639.12s -> 14639.52s]  What?
[14639.52s -> 14640.48s]  ADHD.
[14640.48s -> 14641.60s]  Why are you naked?
[14644.18s -> 14646.18s]  Why are you naked in a karaoke bar?
[14647.23s -> 14647.55s]  What?
[14648.67s -> 14649.95s]  She's taking a sh...
[14655.01s -> 14657.65s]  Why are you taking a shower?
[14672.13s -> 14674.40s]  No, don't leave.
[14674.40s -> 14674.96s]  Don't leave.
[14674.96s -> 14675.52s]  Don't leave.
[14675.52s -> 14676.24s]  Don't leave.
[14677.42s -> 14678.06s]  No.
[14678.06s -> 14679.66s]  I'm gonna get fucking stood up.
[14680.38s -> 14682.94s]  She's checking out the other mystical being that's here, isn't she?
[14684.24s -> 14685.28s]  She's flirting with death.
[14702.85s -> 14715.28s]  All right, give me a break.
[14715.28s -> 14716.32s]  The lady was naked.
[14716.32s -> 14718.88s]  She came out and was taking a shower in the rain.
[14718.88s -> 14720.16s]  And somebody ran her over.
[14721.98s -> 14724.22s]  Why is everyone crying?
[14732.02s -> 14733.46s]  Everyone doesn't have to be crying.
[14743.22s -> 14744.42s]  No, I gotta reset.
[14744.42s -> 14745.62s]  I have to redo it.
[14745.62s -> 14746.10s]  Reset.
[14758.21s -> 14760.37s]  I got an unbelievable story for you.
[14760.37s -> 14763.01s]  So this girl, she was naked in the bar.
[14764.05s -> 14765.01s]  She came outside.
[14765.65s -> 14766.29s]  Nude.
[14766.29s -> 14768.69s]  Started washing under her armpits and shit.
[14768.69s -> 14769.89s]  And what do you know?
[14769.89s -> 14772.21s]  A car comes flying down the street.
[14772.85s -> 14773.65s]  Nails her.
[14773.65s -> 14775.01s]  I mean, like fucking nails her.
[14775.01s -> 14776.05s]  It was ridiculous.
[14778.51s -> 14778.91s]  I'm in.
[14780.59s -> 14781.31s]  She likes me again.
[14783.71s -> 14785.79s]  Recycled joke from last time.
[14788.35s -> 14789.47s]  If a line works, you know.
[14790.27s -> 14794.16s]  No, I'm not gonna open fire.
[14797.33s -> 14799.25s]  Okay, how about romance?
[14799.25s -> 14802.53s]  Are you single?
[14806.80s -> 14807.92s]  Why would I do that right now?
[14807.92s -> 14810.16s]  I don't want to have to save the game every five seconds.
[14820.30s -> 14822.30s]  Okay, let's see.
[14822.30s -> 14822.78s]  Romance.
[14824.06s -> 14825.10s]  Okay, exchange numbers.
[14825.90s -> 14827.02s]  Does Genie have a number?
[14836.35s -> 14837.07s]  All right, can we stop?
[14837.07s -> 14838.27s]  Can we go somewhere else, please?
[14838.27s -> 14843.58s]  What?
[14845.26s -> 14846.06s]  That doesn't...
[14846.06s -> 14847.34s]  Who's changing into nude?
[14848.30s -> 14848.54s]  Me?
[14849.58s -> 14855.17s]  Put it back on.
[14855.17s -> 14855.65s]  Put it back on.
[14855.65s -> 14856.69s]  Put your clothes back on.
[14856.69s -> 14857.73s]  Before anybody notices.
[14857.73s -> 14858.37s]  Quick.
[14858.37s -> 14862.19s]  She's disgusted.
[14862.19s -> 14879.25s]  I think I'm losing her.
[14896.19s -> 14896.98s]  It's all right.
[14896.98s -> 14923.60s]  Never really calm down.
[14924.24s -> 14947.55s]  Oh, what a day.
[14987.98s -> 14996.27s]  No, it's not.
[14996.27s -> 14996.91s]  You don't like it?
[15004.13s -> 15004.93s]  She's sitting down.
[15029.71s -> 15033.47s]  Okay, I don't know how to put my clothes back on.
[15034.67s -> 15037.09s]  I really, I don't know.
[15060.90s -> 15062.18s]  Okay, okay.
[15062.18s -> 15063.30s]  This has gone too far.
[15068.82s -> 15070.50s]  Time to hit him with a car, I guess.
[15078.06s -> 15081.76s]  Can we go home?
[15081.76s -> 15083.52s]  Like, I need to get out of here so I can clean up.
[15087.12s -> 15087.44s]  Really?
[15088.96s -> 15089.36s]  Shut up.
[15092.19s -> 15092.43s]  Good.
[15093.31s -> 15095.10s]  Wait, is that it?
[15095.58s -> 15096.54s]  You got, you don't have more.
[15110.51s -> 15111.39s]  Age down?
[15114.46s -> 15115.02s]  Oh, shit.
[15115.74s -> 15123.73s]  Where am I?
[15128.34s -> 15129.94s]  Did I just clean myself from the toilet?
[15134.30s -> 15135.18s]  Where can I get clothes?
[15135.18s -> 15136.30s]  Can I change clothes in here?
[15140.53s -> 15140.85s]  Uh-oh.
[15142.61s -> 15144.37s]  I think I'm about to lose my date to the gnome.
[15151.79s -> 15152.83s]  Date unsuccessful.
[15153.47s -> 15184.35s]  Jesus Christ.
[15185.15s -> 15186.35s]  All right, no, no, no, no.
[15186.35s -> 15187.71s]  Back home, back home, back home, back home.
[15187.71s -> 15188.51s]  Where'd she go?
[15188.51s -> 15189.15s]  Where's the genie?
[15190.54s -> 15190.94s]  Go home.
[15191.66s -> 15192.46s]  You fucking blew it.
[15192.46s -> 15192.94s]  Get out of here.
[15195.01s -> 15196.93s]  Up next on American Idol, yeah.
[15198.14s -> 15199.82s]  All right, go home, go home, go home.
[15210.29s -> 15210.61s]  Leave.
[15211.57s -> 15212.13s]  Go home.
[15213.46s -> 15214.58s]  I'm just going home.
[15214.58s -> 15214.90s]  Fuck it.
[15216.50s -> 15216.90s]  Get there.
[15218.29s -> 15219.25s]  Center on that lot.
[15220.21s -> 15220.93s]  Get out of here.
[15220.93s -> 15221.17s]  Leave.
[15223.17s -> 15223.49s]  Leave.
[15228.08s -> 15229.44s]  Just go home.
[15229.44s -> 15236.58s]  Where are you going?
[15238.99s -> 15241.71s]  Pauline Pair reached video game level three.
[15253.28s -> 15255.52s]  That's the funniest thing that's happened to all stream.
[15256.16s -> 15259.71s]  He let go of his hands, sneezed.
[15260.51s -> 15263.39s]  That's the funniest fucking thing I've seen all stream.
[15271.31s -> 15272.43s]  How do we get out of here?
[15273.39s -> 15278.99s]  Oh, fuck.
[15278.99s -> 15279.87s]  Now I'm doing this.
[15287.42s -> 15288.86s]  It's happy hour at the karaoke bar.
[15288.86s -> 15290.22s]  I have half drinks, a half fries.
[15290.78s -> 15296.08s]  I don't give a shit about the banana.
[15296.08s -> 15296.80s]  He's a moron.
[15297.36s -> 15301.95s]  What kind of super villain can sneeze without the urethra closing?
[15301.95s -> 15302.59s]  I have no idea.
[15303.39s -> 15311.50s]  So go to the bathroom.
[15312.06s -> 15314.10s]  All right, I didn't even get a chance here.
[15314.74s -> 15315.54s]  How's everybody doing?
[15316.18s -> 15317.06s]  Bladder and energy.
[15317.06s -> 15318.10s]  Go to the bathroom then.
[15318.10s -> 15318.74s]  What's the problem?
[15324.70s -> 15324.94s]  What?
[15330.19s -> 15331.31s]  Didn't I shoot him in the head?
[15335.28s -> 15335.84s]  Okay.
[15335.84s -> 15337.04s]  Do I not have a bathroom?
[15338.02s -> 15338.50s]  No, I do.
[15346.32s -> 15350.56s]  So Pauline Pair is the best gamer in the house, just in case anyone's curious.
[15351.28s -> 15362.56s]  For a second, I thought she was naked and I was going to say,
[15362.56s -> 15364.48s]  wait a minute, I shouldn't have that on the screen.
[15366.46s -> 15368.70s]  Like, I thought it wasn't censored and it was just open.
[15369.34s -> 15370.83s]  All right.
[15370.83s -> 15372.03s]  Come back home.
[15372.03s -> 15372.51s]  Tidy up.
[15372.51s -> 15373.07s]  Care for yourself.
[15373.07s -> 15376.34s]  Bring Benedict Banana here.
[15376.34s -> 15377.22s]  Get over here.
[15378.66s -> 15379.54s]  Still naked.
[15381.26s -> 15382.78s]  Go just take a shower.
[15382.78s -> 15386.00s]  No, that's okay.
[15386.80s -> 15388.38s]  What is in here?
[15388.94s -> 15392.02s]  The Humor and Hijinks Festival is in town.
[15392.02s -> 15394.74s]  Click on any of the dynamic signs around town to find out more.
[15396.00s -> 15396.56s]  Okay.
[15396.56s -> 15398.56s]  Travel to the Humor and Hijinks Festival.
[15398.56s -> 15405.09s]  Who wants to go?
[15406.53s -> 15407.01s]  I don't know.
[15411.62s -> 15411.94s]  Who is it?
[15411.94s -> 15412.98s]  I don't even know who these people are.
[15417.04s -> 15418.08s]  No, you guys have a stay.
[15419.10s -> 15421.58s]  The banana is the piece of just crap.
[15421.58s -> 15424.00s]  This is the genie?
[15427.47s -> 15428.03s]  Is it?
[15428.03s -> 15428.67s]  No, it's not.
[15429.31s -> 15438.10s]  How would I get in contact with the genie?
[15450.32s -> 15451.20s]  Actually, is the genie?
[15452.93s -> 15454.21s]  Oh, I fucking stink.
[15454.21s -> 15454.77s]  God damn it.
[15455.49s -> 15457.65s]  The pranksters and jokesters challenge has begun.
[15457.65s -> 15461.49s]  Drink from either the dark or light tea to join a side.
[15461.49s -> 15467.10s]  Okay, I mean, can I have to drink from the dark tea, right?
[15473.28s -> 15474.08s]  Oh, Jesus.
[15475.74s -> 15476.14s]  All right.
[15476.14s -> 15476.62s]  Give me the...
[15478.61s -> 15479.33s]  Order food.
[15479.33s -> 15479.65s]  Funny.
[15480.45s -> 15484.18s]  How do I order a tea?
[15484.98s -> 15494.48s]  Of course, the gnome is here.
[15494.48s -> 15495.04s]  Hijinks.
[15495.76s -> 15498.86s]  Where am I?
[15499.74s -> 15501.34s]  I wasn't even ready for this.
[15505.79s -> 15506.51s]  View.
[15506.51s -> 15507.23s]  No, get over here.
[15507.71s -> 15508.67s]  Stop viewing things.
[15509.15s -> 15509.71s]  Go to the bar.
[15515.28s -> 15516.32s]  He's very sad.
[15517.70s -> 15518.42s]  Oh, come on.
[15520.77s -> 15525.55s]  Well, join the pranksters.
[15525.55s -> 15526.67s]  Join the pranksters together.
[15527.39s -> 15534.91s]  I was trying to get him to go to the bar, but he's too sad to move.
[15535.55s -> 15538.75s]  Okay, so the genie is going to join the pranksters.
[15542.67s -> 15544.11s]  I told you, I won't move.
[15544.99s -> 15548.32s]  I'm all the way back into the art gallery.
[15548.88s -> 15550.35s]  Can I take a shower in here?
[15554.53s -> 15556.19s]  No.
[15556.19s -> 15556.59s]  Hurry up.
[15556.59s -> 15557.15s]  Get over there.
[15560.27s -> 15564.43s]  The girl you are hanging out with here is currently doing things and having fun.
[15564.43s -> 15564.93s]  Go.
[15573.98s -> 15574.78s]  Take a sip.
[15574.78s -> 15589.84s]  All right, better just join the pranksters.
[15589.84s -> 15591.36s]  Perform pranks?
[15592.08s -> 15594.38s]  All right, so we got to prank people.
[15597.04s -> 15598.24s]  Festival is starting, I think.
[15598.24s -> 15599.76s]  I think we now just have to do some pranks.
[15606.16s -> 15606.56s]  Something...
[15606.56s -> 15607.60s]  Nothing too crazy.
[15607.60s -> 15608.16s]  A prank.
[15610.90s -> 15612.50s]  Order a drink for...
[15613.94s -> 15620.21s]  You got to prank the people that are glowing.
[15620.21s -> 15621.33s]  All right, let's prank this guy.
[15624.93s -> 15625.81s]  All right, let's prank you.
[15630.40s -> 15631.84s]  Okay, more choices.
[15634.16s -> 15635.12s]  Uh, mean.
[15636.32s -> 15636.82s]  No.
[15637.68s -> 15638.18s]  Funny.
[15638.88s -> 15639.68s]  Funny introduction.
[15645.89s -> 15646.69s]  This is a prank?
[15662.05s -> 15663.73s]  Oh no, the people that are glowing.
[15663.73s -> 15665.33s]  Okay, other way, way, way, way.
[15665.33s -> 15666.53s]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[15667.49s -> 15668.77s]  All right, let's get a prank here.
[15680.56s -> 15686.06s]  All right, hack info.
[15693.18s -> 15693.82s]  That look.
[15694.62s -> 15698.29s]  The jokesters are in the lead.
[15699.89s -> 15705.66s]  Cut this shit out.
[15714.00s -> 15717.36s]  Um, what else am I supposed to do?
[15718.56s -> 15719.20s]  Chat with Penny.
[15722.66s -> 15723.70s]  I mean, is it mean?
[15723.70s -> 15724.82s]  Is it just like funny?
[15738.67s -> 15739.55s]  Steal money.
[15740.51s -> 15743.63s]  Fuckin' snitch.
[15746.66s -> 15747.86s]  No, I can't kill anybody.
[15747.86s -> 15748.18s]  We have to...
[15748.18s -> 15750.02s]  There's a cooldown period for when we can kill.
[15750.90s -> 15755.01s]  All right, I'm gonna introduce myself.
[15755.01s -> 15757.65s]  Probably should have slept before this, but I kind of just knee-jerked.
[15758.37s -> 15760.00s]  Where am I?
[15760.00s -> 15767.22s]  What am I doing in here?
[15775.01s -> 15776.61s]  I'm going all the way up the stairs?
[15777.25s -> 15777.49s]  No.
[15781.68s -> 15782.08s]  Okay.
[15796.27s -> 15798.67s]  This is what you wanted to do?
[15803.06s -> 15803.38s]  Why?
[15804.10s -> 15807.02s]  He's like playing with dirt.
[15807.66s -> 15813.68s]  You walked all the way up here to do this.
[15820.59s -> 15832.51s]  I'm very disappointed right now.
[15854.85s -> 15855.73s]  What does that do?
[15860.59s -> 15862.27s]  I snatched my own weave.
[15871.15s -> 15872.11s]  All right, go home.
[15872.91s -> 15873.63s]  I'm done with you.
[15874.43s -> 15876.86s]  Go home.
[15877.50s -> 15878.58s]  I'm done with you.
[15884.59s -> 15886.03s]  Let's focus on somebody else.
[15891.14s -> 15892.74s]  He's like putting his hands out and running like...
[15893.94s -> 15898.64s]  I'm an asshole.
[15906.37s -> 15908.30s]  All right, here we go.
[15911.57s -> 15913.57s]  I think it's time to assume control.
[15917.62s -> 15919.62s]  Where is the question?
[15920.26s -> 15920.90s]  Mac and cheese.
[15920.90s -> 15921.38s]  Excellent.
[15921.38s -> 15922.58s]  Okay, fun and social.
[15922.58s -> 15923.86s]  He needs to have some social shit.
[15924.58s -> 15926.37s]  Where's the lamp?
[15926.93s -> 15928.10s]  Rub the lamp.
[15928.10s -> 15930.58s]  This is the guy that technically the genie is...
[15932.02s -> 15933.94s]  It's his, right?
[15938.75s -> 15940.27s]  Okay, I want some wishes.
[15943.89s -> 15944.37s]  Call over.
[15947.62s -> 15948.34s]  No, not you.
[15948.34s -> 15948.58s]  You.
[15950.98s -> 15951.70s]  More choices.
[15952.26s -> 15953.31s]  How do I get...
[15953.31s -> 15953.71s]  Genie.
[15953.71s -> 15954.59s]  There we go.
[15954.59s -> 15956.03s]  Wish for the genie's freedom.
[15957.54s -> 15958.26s]  Wish for wealth.
[15958.26s -> 15958.90s]  Wish for youth.
[15958.90s -> 15960.26s]  Wish for world peace.
[15966.74s -> 15968.34s]  Wish for the genie's freedom.
[15970.11s -> 15971.07s]  Not yet.
[15971.07s -> 15972.19s]  Wish for world peace.
[15972.19s -> 15972.83s]  Let's see what happens.
[15980.98s -> 15981.46s]  Did it work?
[15983.22s -> 15987.98s]  What does that do?
[15989.18s -> 15990.46s]  Peter, your wish has been granted.
[15992.93s -> 15999.89s]  Well, that's funny.
[16000.62s -> 16002.54s]  Because it's impossible for there to be world peace.
[16003.18s -> 16007.23s]  Because I still have the decisions to make here.
[16007.79s -> 16008.72s]  What does that do?
[16012.02s -> 16013.30s]  Wish for romance.
[16013.30s -> 16013.62s]  Okay.
[16014.59s -> 16015.07s]  With who?
[16015.71s -> 16019.44s]  Is the banana still sad?
[16019.44s -> 16021.92s]  The banana still is at the gallery playing with mud.
[16024.82s -> 16026.18s]  Everyone's really happy now.
[16026.18s -> 16030.98s]  Oh, this is gonna make the banana real sad.
[16031.86s -> 16036.56s]  How many wishes do you get?
[16037.12s -> 16040.35s]  Peter, your wish has been granted.
[16040.35s -> 16044.94s]  Okay, so who do I flirt with?
[16045.58s -> 16047.62s]  Am I...
[16052.93s -> 16053.65s]  It's just us?
[16054.29s -> 16057.38s]  Where are we going?
[16057.38s -> 16069.76s]  Nobody can stop me.
[16069.76s -> 16070.48s]  Cupid's arrow.
[16082.00s -> 16083.36s]  She's the ultimate gamer.
[16083.36s -> 16089.79s]  Look at this.
[16089.79s -> 16092.27s]  Evangelize vegetarian benefits.
[16101.74s -> 16107.36s]  Oh, you blew it.
[16107.36s -> 16107.92s]  You blew it.
[16107.92s -> 16108.64s]  You blew it!
[16115.01s -> 16115.97s]  Let's have a conversation here.
[16118.37s -> 16118.77s]  Let's see.
[16125.95s -> 16127.07s]  Cupid's arrow, huh?
[16127.07s -> 16127.55s]  My ass.
[16128.35s -> 16140.72s]  Let's go to romance again.
[16140.72s -> 16143.82s]  Let's...
[16146.03s -> 16147.15s]  Casual discussion.
[16147.15s -> 16148.03s]  Okay, hold on.
[16148.03s -> 16148.83s]  Let's go on a date.
[16150.27s -> 16152.40s]  All right, I'll take you on a date to the gallery.
[16157.33s -> 16158.05s]  Has it got the...
[16158.05s -> 16158.93s]  Did I just say no?
[16160.37s -> 16162.06s]  I didn't get a chance to do it.
[16164.22s -> 16165.50s]  Taking her on a date to the gallery.
[16166.14s -> 16168.74s]  At the Casbah gallery.
[16188.48s -> 16188.80s]  Shit!
[16191.62s -> 16192.34s]  How about just...
[16192.34s -> 16194.02s]  I'll just say a compliment.
[16194.02s -> 16194.50s]  I don't know.
[16195.06s -> 16196.29s]  What book is that?
[16197.01s -> 16197.89s]  What book are you reading?
[16200.02s -> 16201.94s]  Reading real her in.
[16209.17s -> 16211.41s]  Perfect reading material right now, apparently.
[16211.41s -> 16211.73s]  Okay.
[16213.50s -> 16215.02s]  Look at this fucking gamer.
[16215.02s -> 16216.06s]  This is unbelievable.
[16232.98s -> 16234.58s]  He read the book and now he's gonna see if it works.
[16239.42s -> 16240.78s]  The banana is still...
[16240.78s -> 16241.98s]  I don't even know what the banana is.
[16242.94s -> 16243.58s]  Playing with dirt.
[16243.58s -> 16251.54s]  Shower in the rain.
[16251.54s -> 16252.02s]  Why is this...
[16252.02s -> 16253.70s]  I don't understand the shower in the rain shit.
[16255.46s -> 16257.54s]  He's picking up the book to go learn.
[16257.54s -> 16258.02s]  That's right.
[16258.02s -> 16261.14s]  You go fucking figure it out first before you make any dumb moves.
[16264.10s -> 16264.58s]  Ah, fuck.
[16265.70s -> 16268.50s]  I really gotta learn what the fuck I'm doing when I talk to women.
[16268.50s -> 16270.18s]  I'm not really making a fool of myself.
[16274.91s -> 16275.63s]  Uh, let's get some...
[16278.05s -> 16279.17s]  What happened to the book of chaos?
[16280.93s -> 16281.81s]  Oh, banana's back.
[16287.95s -> 16288.91s]  No, not even hello.
[16289.55s -> 16289.95s]  Nothing.
[16291.57s -> 16292.77s]  Just good night.
[16292.77s -> 16293.33s]  I'm going to bed.
[16294.05s -> 16297.76s]  I feel bad.
[16298.56s -> 16304.18s]  I actually feel kind of bad.
[16304.18s -> 16304.74s]  I really do.
[16311.68s -> 16312.16s]  All right.
[16312.16s -> 16313.92s]  Who has the highest...
[16315.36s -> 16316.64s]  I want to see if somebody can...
[16316.64s -> 16317.20s]  I want that...
[16317.84s -> 16319.84s]  I want the genie as a love interest.
[16321.86s -> 16322.42s]  Who has the...
[16322.42s -> 16323.22s]  Okay, awkward.
[16323.86s -> 16328.03s]  Should I wake up the banana?
[16333.66s -> 16334.62s]  Free the genie first?
[16335.34s -> 16338.56s]  Where's the genie gonna live, guys?
[16340.56s -> 16343.89s]  I mean, that's great.
[16343.89s -> 16345.09s]  Like, oh, like, yeah.
[16345.17s -> 16347.01s]  Genie, here you are.
[16347.01s -> 16348.61s]  You don't have to, like, be in the lamp.
[16348.61s -> 16349.49s]  We got two beds here.
[16353.68s -> 16361.23s]  Let's get to know each other.
[16362.93s -> 16363.97s]  Ask about your career.
[16369.97s -> 16370.45s]  All right.
[16371.33s -> 16372.37s]  The reading paid off.
[16375.49s -> 16379.89s]  What are you doing?
[16381.49s -> 16383.25s]  No, this is the problem.
[16383.25s -> 16386.53s]  You guys, you can't just go play on the computer.
[16394.69s -> 16395.17s]  She's gone.
[16395.17s -> 16395.57s]  She left.
[16396.13s -> 16400.86s]  Time to go play Sims forever.
[16400.86s -> 16401.10s]  What?
[16401.66s -> 16407.66s]  What do you mean forever?
[16413.55s -> 16413.87s]  Okay.
[16415.17s -> 16420.14s]  Well, I think it's time to check on the other household.
[16422.34s -> 16423.14s]  See how they're doing.
[16423.86s -> 16427.92s]  Let's head out to the map.
[16427.92s -> 16433.12s]  Let's get a save.
[16433.84s -> 16436.37s]  Let's check on the other household.
[16440.91s -> 16442.19s]  No, we gotta go back, right?
[16445.71s -> 16446.51s]  Cancel the travel.
[16446.51s -> 16448.83s]  Oh, how do I go back to manage worlds, right?
[16451.12s -> 16452.72s]  Just go to manage worlds.
[16453.44s -> 16462.13s]  All right.
[16463.74s -> 16464.38s]  This is the fruits.
[16464.38s -> 16465.10s]  We don't need to see them.
[16465.10s -> 16465.74s]  Let's go to...
[16466.94s -> 16468.45s]  That's the gnome.
[16468.45s -> 16469.81s]  I don't want to play with the gnome.
[16471.22s -> 16471.46s]  All right.
[16471.46s -> 16473.06s]  Let's do some stuff with these three.
[16473.78s -> 16475.62s]  Let's go to like a club or something or a bar.
[16475.62s -> 16477.54s]  Some like a video game hangout or something.
[16478.34s -> 16480.08s]  Select the Sim to play.
[16481.97s -> 16482.69s]  Me.
[16482.69s -> 16484.34s]  I just saved.
[16484.98s -> 16487.15s]  Yeah, I'm good.
[16487.15s -> 16487.55s]  I saved.
[16488.11s -> 16493.17s]  I'm already at the bar.
[16493.17s -> 16493.49s]  All right.
[16494.13s -> 16496.16s]  I'm ready.
[16496.16s -> 16498.61s]  I'm here with the dog.
[16498.61s -> 16499.49s]  Why is the dog here?
[16500.21s -> 16505.41s]  Why is the dog here?
[16505.41s -> 16508.37s]  How would I bring the dog?
[16508.37s -> 16509.09s]  There's nobody here.
[16509.89s -> 16511.66s]  What am I doing outside?
[16512.38s -> 16520.85s]  Well, that's...
[16520.85s -> 16521.97s]  There's two people at that bar.
[16522.69s -> 16525.54s]  All right.
[16525.54s -> 16526.34s]  Let's go.
[16526.34s -> 16526.98s]  Let's take a walk.
[16528.90s -> 16531.42s]  Go do your business.
[16534.59s -> 16535.55s]  He's pissing on me.
[16539.30s -> 16540.50s]  No one has died in a bit.
[16540.50s -> 16541.14s]  Just saying.
[16543.30s -> 16547.34s]  That's because I haven't turned on auto kill.
[16551.94s -> 16555.07s]  Well, I can't pick it up.
[16555.07s -> 16556.99s]  How am I doing on stats?
[16558.64s -> 16559.28s]  Where is it here?
[16561.49s -> 16562.21s]  Let's see.
[16562.21s -> 16563.01s]  I'm actually pretty good.
[16563.81s -> 16564.38s]  All right.
[16564.38s -> 16566.14s]  Get unpleasant surround.

[16567.10s -> 16567.82s]  Let's go back.
[16568.70s -> 16569.34s]  Back in the house.
[16570.22s -> 16575.58s]  Back in the house.
[16578.72s -> 16579.60s]  You don't need to be here.
[16579.60s -> 16582.66s]  Back in the move-in household.
[16582.66s -> 16583.38s]  Visit apartment.
[16583.38s -> 16584.66s]  Who's visiting?
[16587.71s -> 16588.75s]  I'm visiting somebody's house.
[16600.32s -> 16600.80s]  Or...
[16600.80s -> 16601.44s]  Okay.
[16601.44s -> 16602.24s]  Whose house is this?
[16603.12s -> 16609.90s]  I didn't get kicked out of my own house.
[16610.98s -> 16612.50s]  702 Zenview.
[16615.04s -> 16616.16s]  This is my house.
[16620.32s -> 16620.72s]  All right.
[16622.11s -> 16623.31s]  Let's see what happens.
[16623.31s -> 16624.11s]  Let's save it here.
[16628.30s -> 16629.42s]  I didn't get evicted though.
[16631.60s -> 16632.24s]  Where's the broom?
[16632.96s -> 16635.36s]  Everyone's obsessed with the damn computer.
[16637.81s -> 16638.29s]  All right.
[16638.29s -> 16640.29s]  It's time to make a murder mystery happen.
[16640.53s -> 16641.57s]  Let's have a killer here.
[16645.44s -> 16646.16s]  And maybe not.
[16646.16s -> 16646.56s]  Not yet.
[16646.56s -> 16647.12s]  Not yet.
[16647.12s -> 16648.80s]  Let's have a fucking party here or something.
[16648.80s -> 16649.04s]  Let's...
[16649.60s -> 16655.74s]  The cat is sick?
[16656.38s -> 16663.34s]  How is the cat sick?
[16664.56s -> 16665.68s]  Anxious plus three.
[16675.47s -> 16676.91s]  I'm not putting the cat in the fucking oven.
[16678.11s -> 16678.43s]  All right.
[16680.21s -> 16680.85s]  I need to...
[16680.85s -> 16681.97s]  Cat needs to eat.
[16681.97s -> 16683.25s]  So eat and then let's play.
[16685.82s -> 16686.70s]  Are there food bowls?
[16687.87s -> 16688.67s]  There's food right here.
[16689.47s -> 16693.84s]  You sound like a goddamn ghost from Mario 64.
[16696.21s -> 16697.17s]  Where are the food bowls?
[16697.17s -> 16698.37s]  Didn't I have two of them?
[16704.03s -> 16704.59s]  Apparently not.
[16704.59s -> 16705.63s]  Maybe it was before I saved.
[16706.27s -> 16715.47s]  I'm gonna throw a party.
[16727.76s -> 16728.96s]  No, I gotta fill it with me.
[16730.48s -> 16733.55s]  She's hungry.
[16733.55s -> 16736.78s]  All right.
[16736.78s -> 16738.46s]  Let me see what happens now.
[16739.94s -> 16740.82s]  Hunger is pretty low.
[16740.82s -> 16741.38s]  Let's go eat.
[16742.10s -> 16743.65s]  And then I'm throwing a party.
[16743.65s -> 16745.01s]  I'm inviting all my friends over.
[16749.87s -> 16750.11s]  Why?
[16750.11s -> 16751.23s]  What's wrong with the cat?
[16751.23s -> 16751.63s]  What?
[16751.63s -> 16751.95s]  Play.
[16752.83s -> 16753.15s]  Play.
[16753.15s -> 16753.39s]  Play.
[16753.39s -> 16753.87s]  Let's play.
[16754.43s -> 16754.99s]  Play with...
[16754.99s -> 16764.59s]  Get attention from Vroomer.
[16767.39s -> 16768.19s]  What friends?
[16768.19s -> 16769.95s]  I'm gonna call people over and hang out.
[16777.09s -> 16778.61s]  Let's get a party set up.
[16778.61s -> 16781.34s]  You think this is a shitty grilled cheese?
[16781.34s -> 16781.66s]  Really?
[16782.30s -> 16783.84s]  I'm an asshole.
[16783.84s -> 16784.24s]  All right.
[16784.24s -> 16784.88s]  Inventory.
[16786.80s -> 16787.92s]  Let's get a party going.

[16791.39s -> 16792.75s]  I'm gonna invite everybody.
[16792.75s -> 16794.35s]  Lock the door and have a murder mystery.
[16798.83s -> 16799.47s]  But first...
[16799.47s -> 16801.79s]  That was a liquid grilled cheese.
[16807.46s -> 16807.70s]  All right.
[16807.70s -> 16808.26s]  Let's go.
[16808.26s -> 16808.66s]  Save it.
[16809.30s -> 16816.86s]  Who ran over the cat?
[16816.86s -> 16817.82s]  Nobody ran over the cat.
[16818.38s -> 16819.42s]  The cat is just fine.
[16821.20s -> 16822.00s]  Open up my phone.

[16913.62s -> 16914.67s]  I just don't.
[16915.47s -> 16917.98s]  All right.
[16917.98s -> 16918.70s]  Let's join a gang.
[16919.34s -> 16920.77s]  We have to make friends somehow.

[16938.19s -> 16939.95s]  Jeremy has joined the thotties gang.
[16939.95s -> 16942.75s]  Jeremy will now contribute in their acts autonomously.
[16942.75s -> 16944.75s]  You can disable the autonomy from the mod's options.
[16945.79s -> 16949.07s]  Be aware members from other gangs will hunt and kill Jeremy
[16949.07s -> 16955.54s]  if he killed a member of their gang.
[16955.54s -> 16956.90s]  I have a joke.
[16956.90s -> 16957.94s]  Is the cat dead?
[16959.22s -> 16959.62s]  Okay.

[16980.64s -> 16981.04s]  All right.
[16987.65s -> 16988.53s]  Is that a thottie?
[16994.22s -> 16994.46s]  What?
[16994.46s -> 16995.82s]  They're logging.
[16995.82s -> 17002.22s]  Uh-oh.
[17004.72s -> 17007.22s]  I don't understand.
[17009.30s -> 17011.86s]  Why is Red Dead Redemption 2 music playing?
[17014.02s -> 17015.14s]  They're all coming into town.
[17017.20s -> 17017.44s]  All right.
[17017.44s -> 17019.20s]  So they don't...

[17028.86s -> 17029.58s]  Does he get to join?
[17034.35s -> 17035.31s]  How do I join?
[17035.31s -> 17035.79s]  You join.
[17036.51s -> 17036.91s]  That's good.
[17037.87s -> 17038.75s]  What do they want me to do?
[17048.64s -> 17060.85s]  I just called the cops.
[17060.85s -> 17061.17s]  All right.
[17061.17s -> 17062.21s]  What's the emergency?
[17068.22s -> 17069.42s]  I don't understand what's happening.
[17072.80s -> 17074.96s]  You called the cops and now you're gonna throw money?
[17075.68s -> 17076.80s]  What's your emergency?
[17076.80s -> 17077.68s]  It's the thotties.
[17077.68s -> 17078.64s]  They're here.
[17078.64s -> 17079.36s]  Don't you see them?
[17103.66s -> 17106.22s]  All right.
[17106.22s -> 17108.26s]  Well, it's not exactly.
[17108.26s -> 17112.10s]  It looks like Jeremy isn't used to eating spicy food with time.
[17112.10s -> 17114.58s]  What do you mean I'm not used to eating spicy food?
[17115.38s -> 17124.43s]  All right.
[17124.43s -> 17126.75s]  I need to open up my fucking gang activity menu.
[17128.64s -> 17129.44s]  They just closed.
[17130.08s -> 17130.77s]  All right.
[17130.77s -> 17131.57s]  Where are the thotties?
[17132.13s -> 17135.14s]  Is this something I need to do?

[17159.84s -> 17160.88s]  It's hitman time.
[17161.84s -> 17163.36s]  Well, the thotties are just in town.
[17164.00s -> 17165.55s]  What's this?
[17166.11s -> 17169.79s]  What am I doing?
[17170.75s -> 17174.14s]  I just like strangled him for no reason.
[17178.90s -> 17179.14s]  What?
[17181.50s -> 17182.38s]  What happened to him?
[17183.10s -> 17185.98s]  No, no, no, no.
[17185.98s -> 17186.46s]  Don't leave.
[17188.90s -> 17190.26s]  They took his hair.
[17191.22s -> 17193.30s]  They grabbed his hair and ripped it off.
[17196.24s -> 17196.56s]  All right.
[17196.56s -> 17197.36s]  Fight back, dude.
[17197.36s -> 17197.60s]  All right.
[17198.40s -> 17199.28s]  Fuck this.
[17199.28s -> 17200.48s]  He's going to join the Vroomers.

[17220.38s -> 17221.50s]  Invite the hardwood gang to town.
[17229.98s -> 17231.82s]  Vroomer has joined the hardwood gang.
[17231.82s -> 17233.10s]  God damn it.
[17233.10s -> 17233.42s]  Why?
[17241.65s -> 17242.45s]  This is going to get ugly.
[17244.56s -> 17245.28s]  What was that?
[17245.28s -> 17246.08s]  Is this one of them?
[17251.30s -> 17252.18s]  What is the noise?
[17252.18s -> 17253.14s]  I'm hearing noises.
[17253.78s -> 17260.91s]  All right.
[17260.91s -> 17262.19s]  This would be a gang panel.
[17263.07s -> 17275.25s]  Oh, somebody's going to be struck by lightning, I think.
[17282.88s -> 17284.16s]  Aren't these two mortal enemies?
[17284.96s -> 17288.32s]  Who's even out here?
[17289.34s -> 17289.98s]  He's sleeping.
[17290.62s -> 17291.26s]  Dog's fine.
[17292.29s -> 17293.17s]  Cat's fine.
[17293.17s -> 17293.41s]  Right?
[17293.97s -> 17297.31s]  Where am I?
[17297.31s -> 17297.63s]  All right.
[17297.63s -> 17298.03s]  I'm fine.
[17298.75s -> 17301.14s]  Yeah.
[17301.14s -> 17304.02s]  I'm just giving like I'm saying hello to all my fellow gang members.
[17305.86s -> 17318.94s]  This is the lamest gang fight I've ever seen.
[17324.74s -> 17325.38s]  Who's this?
[17326.02s -> 17327.78s]  There's a guy with an umbrella just keeps walking by.
[17327.78s -> 17328.58s]  I have a bat now.
[17329.30s -> 17334.27s]  Oh, she's gone.
[17343.18s -> 17344.72s]  All right.
[17344.72s -> 17345.04s]  Gang.
[17346.40s -> 17354.74s]  Jesus.
[17354.74s -> 17355.78s]  That thunder.
[17355.78s -> 17360.32s]  Can one of you...
[17360.32s -> 17362.08s]  Can one of my boys stand up for me here?
[17379.42s -> 17379.74s]  Is this...
[17379.74s -> 17398.29s]  It's the genie.
[17399.87s -> 17400.91s]  It's the genie.
[17403.57s -> 17404.37s]  Is it the genie?
[17413.17s -> 17414.53s]  What's the dog out here?
[17416.29s -> 17416.61s]  All right.
[17416.61s -> 17417.49s]  Retaliation.
[17441.07s -> 17445.22s]  Can somebody else fight back?
[17445.22s -> 17447.58s]  Somebody has to fight back.
[17447.58s -> 17449.26s]  I'm hearing people getting hit by bats.
[17460.16s -> 17461.36s]  Where the fuck did you come from?
[17461.92s -> 17463.71s]  Like I got instant muscles.
[17470.94s -> 17471.82s]  Is this the genie?
[17473.12s -> 17474.24s]  Is this the genie?
[17474.24s -> 17475.76s]  I don't know if this is the genie or not.
[17482.26s -> 17483.46s]  Fame and reputation.
[17484.56s -> 17486.08s]  Who the fuck are you?
[17488.06s -> 17489.42s]  Who is this person?
[17490.06s -> 17491.98s]  Why is there a golden cowboy?
[17493.26s -> 17494.62s]  Has anybody figured this out?
[17496.80s -> 17498.00s]  Golden cowboy.
[17498.80s -> 17505.50s]  Funny introduction.
[17505.50s -> 17506.38s]  I need to know this person.

[17509.73s -> 17511.01s]  I need to hang out with this person right now.
[17512.29s -> 17513.01s]  Please be a friend.
[17513.73s -> 17522.70s]  There's a knife in my hand.
[17522.70s -> 17522.94s]  All right.
[17522.94s -> 17523.42s]  Forget it.
[17523.42s -> 17523.74s]  Stop.
[17523.74s -> 17523.98s]  Stop.
[17523.98s -> 17524.14s]  Stop.
[17524.14s -> 17524.38s]  Stop.
[17524.38s -> 17526.22s]  I want to be friends with the golden cowboy.
[17527.10s -> 17530.29s]  Share...
[17531.25s -> 17535.46s]  Why is he asleep?
[17537.14s -> 17546.69s]  Oh my god.
[17546.69s -> 17548.45s]  Can we get rid of them so they stop crying?
[17555.10s -> 17556.19s]  He's back.
[17556.19s -> 17557.55s]  He's got his hair back too.
[17557.55s -> 17558.03s]  He's fine.
[17558.91s -> 17561.38s]  That guy also has a gun.
[17562.26s -> 17564.93s]  Don't ask me why that person has a gun in their hand.
[17568.58s -> 17575.57s]  Are we just going to continuously cry?
[17584.26s -> 17585.14s]  Oh my god.
[17586.42s -> 17587.14s]  All right.
[17587.14s -> 17587.54s]  Enough.
[17588.50s -> 17590.86s]  Enough.
[17591.58s -> 17594.62s]  Make friends with this weird golden cowboy, please.
[17595.58s -> 17603.38s]  What are you doing?
[17604.46s -> 17606.22s]  Witness gang murder.
[17606.22s -> 17606.38s]  No.
[17607.42s -> 17608.70s]  I want this guy's phone number.
[17610.06s -> 17610.78s]  What are you...
[17610.78s -> 17611.42s]  Excuse me.
[17613.25s -> 17614.05s]  What happened?
[17621.07s -> 17622.59s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[17622.59s -> 17623.87s]  No, no, no, no.
[17623.87s -> 17626.72s]  No, please.
[17627.52s -> 17628.40s]  Just talk.
[17630.08s -> 17632.24s]  I just need to get his phone number.
[17632.24s -> 17633.76s]  I don't care about anything else.
[17633.76s -> 17634.72s]  Holy shit.
[17638.48s -> 17639.44s]  No, stop.
[17643.01s -> 17643.89s]  Anybody out here that...
[17652.03s -> 17653.39s]  Stop running home.
[17654.11s -> 17655.31s]  Oh, you're the worst.
[17660.83s -> 17661.15s]  Chat.
[17662.59s -> 17662.91s]  Chat.
[17665.26s -> 17666.14s]  I'm both fucking...
[17667.82s -> 17672.03s]  I just want his name.
[17672.59s -> 17673.60s]  Just want his name.
[17676.03s -> 17677.23s]  Okay, here we go.
[17677.23s -> 17677.47s]  Chat.
[17679.46s -> 17680.34s]  Go over there.
[17682.50s -> 17683.22s]  What are you doing?
[17687.54s -> 17689.46s]  Don't give me money and run.
[17689.46s -> 17691.86s]  Oh my god, you fucking little asshole.
[17691.86s -> 17692.18s]  Wait.
[17693.14s -> 17693.54s]  Wait.
[17700.35s -> 17701.07s]  Fuck you then.
[17718.46s -> 17719.58s]  I don't know who these people are.
[17720.30s -> 17723.82s]  He got away.
[17723.82s -> 17725.18s]  Where was I ever going to find him again?
[17730.96s -> 17732.64s]  I let the treasure goblin get away.
[17733.86s -> 17735.86s]  I'm not killing this person anymore.
[17738.82s -> 17739.22s]  All right.
[17739.22s -> 17742.10s]  It's time for you to cut the shit and have a part.
[17742.10s -> 17742.90s]  Did I meet anybody?
[17744.40s -> 17746.40s]  I need to see if I chat with...
[17749.41s -> 17749.73s]  There you go.
[17749.73s -> 17750.45s]  I met one person.
[17751.09s -> 17757.34s]  I need to make friends.
[17758.06s -> 17764.83s]  What are you doing here?
[17764.83s -> 17768.69s]  Why is death here?
[17793.46s -> 17795.54s]  I just made him gain some weight.
[17796.50s -> 17797.46s]  Bark at.
[17837.38s -> 17840.90s]  Okay, so something we need to remember here is somebody...
[17842.34s -> 17843.30s]  That was fucking weird.
[17845.10s -> 17846.94s]  The girl was killed in here.
[17846.94s -> 17851.10s]  Let's keep moving here.
[17851.10s -> 17851.58s]  Can I move?
[17852.22s -> 17853.26s]  No, not with him.
[17853.90s -> 17856.02s]  At least you're having fun.
[17856.02s -> 17857.22s]  Can somebody clean this up?
[17857.86s -> 17865.71s]  Okay, so who...
[17866.83s -> 17868.75s]  You guys, both you two are still alive, so that's good.
[17869.39s -> 17870.75s]  I'm okay with this.
[17873.30s -> 17874.34s]  Death killed somebody.
[17874.34s -> 17874.90s]  No, no, no, no.
[17884.02s -> 17886.35s]  What are you doing with that gun?
[17890.32s -> 17890.80s]  Who is this?
[17891.52s -> 17898.08s]  He was going to shoot me and then he realized how bad I smelled and his AI fucked up.
[17898.08s -> 17915.33s]  I've got to get in front of it.
[17915.97s -> 17932.30s]  Can I go home now?
[17937.25s -> 17937.81s]  You smell something?
[17937.81s -> 17939.01s]  He thought I was already dead, yeah.
[17942.54s -> 17943.90s]  Why am I still dressed like this?
[17943.90s -> 17944.94s]  Why am I still doing this?
[17945.66s -> 17950.56s]  Why are people glowing?
[17950.56s -> 17953.44s]  Because I enabled world peace from the genie,
[17954.24s -> 17956.00s]  which I'm not even sure the genie exists anymore.
[17956.00s -> 17957.36s]  Does somebody free the genie?
[17966.66s -> 17968.10s]  World peace sure didn't work.
[17968.82s -> 17978.83s]  Get out of here.
[17978.83s -> 17979.07s]  Home.
[17980.03s -> 17983.65s]  Stop dancing and go home.
[17983.65s -> 17984.85s]  How do I leave the gang?
[17986.13s -> 17990.98s]  You just can't get over a tenure.
[17991.62s -> 17996.27s]  I did a great job upholding the world peace.
[17996.27s -> 17998.43s]  I'm gonna be honest with you.
[17999.15s -> 18003.30s]  I didn't mean to do anything.
[18003.30s -> 18003.62s]  They just...
[18005.54s -> 18006.74s]  I did like the gang fight.
[18010.42s -> 18011.70s]  You can't actually do this, can you?
[18022.21s -> 18024.19s]  What are you doing out here?
[18024.99s -> 18028.08s]  Why does everybody keep leaving the house?
[18031.70s -> 18032.90s]  I need to know what you're doing out here.
[18032.90s -> 18033.54s]  Let's follow you.
[18040.00s -> 18040.24s]  And?
[18040.96s -> 18044.82s]  What are you doing?
[18044.82s -> 18047.25s]  Is it the person that's walking towards me?
[18047.89s -> 18054.58s]  That was a huge strike of lightning.
[18059.14s -> 18060.10s]  I'm gonna sit here and watch.
[18060.98s -> 18063.31s]  This is kind of concerning.
[18066.75s -> 18068.83s]  You know the umbrella is supposed to stay up.
[18069.55s -> 18075.39s]  That's the banana.
[18076.03s -> 18078.42s]  We're getting a crossover episode here.
[18102.48s -> 18104.08s]  I came all the way over here just to do that.
[18108.69s -> 18109.41s]  I don't like this.
[18115.31s -> 18117.15s]  And now he's very sad.
[18126.90s -> 18127.62s]  Very sad.
[18127.62s -> 18128.34s]  What's your problem?
[18130.05s -> 18130.93s]  Social talk.
[18130.93s -> 18131.57s]  Meet some friends.
[18131.57s -> 18132.53s]  I need to have a party.
[18140.75s -> 18142.35s]  I apparently punched this guy in the face.
[18154.13s -> 18158.74s]  I walked over punched him in the face and then
[18159.38s -> 18161.30s]  fell asleep on the bench apparently.
[18162.86s -> 18164.70s]  But why wouldn't you just go to bed?
[18167.38s -> 18167.62s]  What?
[18172.35s -> 18172.67s]  Why?
[18178.91s -> 18180.83s]  Eight is running away?
[18180.83s -> 18181.47s]  Hold on.
[18181.47s -> 18182.43s]  Who's running away?
[18183.15s -> 18184.35s]  Eight is running away?
[18185.31s -> 18188.61s]  But posting an alert via computer or a phone can help find.
[18188.61s -> 18189.65s]  What do you mean find her?
[18190.45s -> 18190.77s]  Where?
[18190.77s -> 18191.49s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[18197.98s -> 18198.78s]  Don't leave.
[18202.86s -> 18204.14s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[18207.30s -> 18207.62s]  Stop.
[18207.62s -> 18208.34s]  Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[18208.34s -> 18208.50s]  You.
[18208.50s -> 18209.46s]  You're out here.
[18209.46s -> 18210.02s]  Go get her.
[18210.90s -> 18211.62s]  Right now.
[18211.62s -> 18212.34s]  Stop what you're doing.
[18213.06s -> 18217.04s]  Where's the fucking cat?
[18217.04s -> 18217.44s]  Where is she?
[18218.16s -> 18218.72s]  All right there.
[18219.36s -> 18220.08s]  You.
[18220.08s -> 18220.56s]  Go get her.
[18221.28s -> 18227.09s]  Take to the bed.
[18229.58s -> 18230.06s]  Get over there.
[18230.06s -> 18230.46s]  Hurry up.
[18231.02s -> 18232.06s]  Don't let her run away.
[18235.65s -> 18236.13s]  Come on.
[18237.52s -> 18237.92s]  Quickly.
[18238.72s -> 18239.68s]  Don't let her get away.
[18240.56s -> 18243.17s]  How do I run?
[18245.74s -> 18247.10s]  Run, run, run.
[18247.98s -> 18250.58s]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[18250.58s -> 18251.46s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[18251.46s -> 18251.86s]  Go over here.
[18255.12s -> 18255.60s]  Over here.
[18257.18s -> 18258.22s]  No, sit here.
[18258.22s -> 18260.06s]  Lie down, lie down, lie down, lie down, lie down.
[18261.42s -> 18262.78s]  Get the fuck over there.
[18266.83s -> 18267.31s]  Come on.
[18268.03s -> 18271.31s]  Come on.
[18273.15s -> 18274.35s]  Where the fuck are you?
[18274.99s -> 18275.47s]  Where is he?
[18276.27s -> 18278.11s]  Hurry up.
[18285.46s -> 18286.42s]  He's just strolling there.
[18288.34s -> 18288.74s]  Wait.
[18288.74s -> 18289.30s]  Hey, hey.
[18291.07s -> 18291.39s]  Who's?
[18293.12s -> 18293.76s]  Back up.
[18293.76s -> 18294.00s]  No, no, no.
[18294.00s -> 18294.56s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[18294.56s -> 18294.72s]  My.
[18295.36s -> 18307.95s]  I'm just taking drugs.
[18307.95s -> 18308.51s]  Where am I?
[18309.15s -> 18319.98s]  Oh my God.
[18319.98s -> 18320.78s]  You're so dumb.
[18321.58s -> 18323.26s]  Go pick up the cat.
[18325.07s -> 18325.31s]  Go.
[18334.91s -> 18335.71s]  What are you doing?
[18336.35s -> 18337.47s]  Why are you not paying?
[18350.46s -> 18352.70s]  Pick up the cat.
[18352.70s -> 18353.42s]  Pick up the cat.
[18357.94s -> 18358.74s]  Pick up the cat.
[18359.79s -> 18361.31s]  Put the bat away now.
[18361.87s -> 18363.23s]  Put the bat away right fucking now.
[18363.23s -> 18364.11s]  Pick this cat up now.
[18364.91s -> 18366.82s]  Don't you dare.
[18375.89s -> 18377.33s]  Why would you yell at the cat?
[18378.74s -> 18379.62s]  What are you doing?
[18380.74s -> 18381.86s]  It's so bad.
[18384.35s -> 18387.55s]  Hey, don't beep for your shell.
[18388.11s -> 18389.47s]  What the hell is wrong with you?
[18392.67s -> 18393.71s]  Rumor is mean.
[18393.71s -> 18396.43s]  Mean Sims become happy when they say mean things to other Sims.
[18399.86s -> 18400.42s]  What's wrong?
[18411.34s -> 18411.58s]  Okay.
[18413.95s -> 18414.43s]  Comfort.
[18417.68s -> 18418.80s]  Take cat to the vet.
[18420.22s -> 18420.70s]  All right.
[18420.70s -> 18421.58s]  We're good now.
[18421.58s -> 18422.22s]  Everything's fine.
[18423.34s -> 18424.14s]  All right.
[18424.14s -> 18424.54s]  Go home.
[18425.74s -> 18428.37s]  Time to go home.
[18430.91s -> 18431.15s]  No.
[18431.15s -> 18431.63s]  Take it to the vet.
[18434.67s -> 18440.18s]  Time for vet.
[18440.18s -> 18441.14s]  Bring to vet now.
[18442.58s -> 18443.30s]  Okay.
[18443.30s -> 18444.02s]  Thank God.
[18445.79s -> 18447.07s]  Traveling to the vet.
[18447.07s -> 18447.63s]  Where's the vet?
[18448.27s -> 18462.11s]  Is it that different world?
[18462.91s -> 18474.08s]  Can we leave the Brindledon Bay to the vet?
[18474.72s -> 18479.30s]  It's the Wharf Vet Clinic.
[18481.10s -> 18481.50s]  Let's go.
[18482.30s -> 18493.79s]  I've got a cat here.
[18494.67s -> 18495.95s]  I need some.
[18495.95s -> 18496.67s]  I got a cat.
[18500.48s -> 18500.72s]  Okay.
[18501.54s -> 18502.10s]  Let's go in.
[18508.29s -> 18509.25s]  Can you treat my cat?
[18509.81s -> 18515.04s]  Why am I walking like this?
[18520.22s -> 18521.50s]  What is that dog?
[18526.10s -> 18526.50s]  Okay.
[18530.06s -> 18531.74s]  This is liquid.
[18531.74s -> 18532.70s]  Liquid diarrhea.
[18533.26s -> 18565.44s]  Am I taking money from the register?
[18565.44s -> 18565.68s]  No.
[18571.02s -> 18571.34s]  Okay.
[18571.34s -> 18572.14s]  I'm fine.
[18572.14s -> 18576.67s]  So I don't give a shit about the cat that's out there.
[18585.78s -> 18586.18s]  Coffee.
[18587.22s -> 18587.86s]  Okay.
[18587.86s -> 18590.82s]  What about that Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer dog?
[18596.82s -> 18597.94s]  I'm not supposed to be in here.
[18610.53s -> 18611.41s]  Why am I in here?
[18617.42s -> 18618.14s]  Is he spraying?
[18618.14s -> 18618.78s]  Spray painting?
[18619.42s -> 18620.62s]  What is on my gun?
[18621.66s -> 18622.06s]  What?
[18624.37s -> 18625.97s]  What was my gun?
[18625.97s -> 18627.73s]  The wallpaper of the bathroom.
[18637.82s -> 18638.14s]  Why?
[18638.94s -> 18639.26s]  What?
[18639.90s -> 18641.42s]  What are you doing?
[18641.42s -> 18641.98s]  Why?
[18645.06s -> 18645.38s]  What?
[18648.42s -> 18649.38s]  What on earth?
[18650.02s -> 18651.94s]  Somebody please help my cat.
[18654.72s -> 18656.48s]  Why would you do this?
[18658.16s -> 18659.44s]  Unfucking believable.
[18664.46s -> 18665.50s]  This is so sad.
[18666.30s -> 18667.09s]  What do I hear?
[18667.09s -> 18667.81s]  Alien sounds.
[18668.37s -> 18670.03s]  Hello?
[18670.83s -> 18675.90s]  Oh, this is the worst.
[18677.92s -> 18678.80s]  I need treatment.
[18678.80s -> 18679.20s]  Please.
[18680.00s -> 18681.44s]  Treat me.
[18682.24s -> 18684.64s]  Treat me.
[18685.28s -> 18688.82s]  That's got another cup of coffee.
[18712.45s -> 18714.21s]  The thing in the front desk?
[18714.21s -> 18715.01s]  Oh shit.
[18715.01s -> 18715.33s]  Okay.
[18716.88s -> 18718.40s]  Sign 8 in for curing.
[18718.40s -> 18720.24s]  Sign 8 in for a spay.
[18727.06s -> 18728.42s]  Death is hitting on somebody over there.
[18733.10s -> 18734.30s]  He's gonna do it again.
[18734.30s -> 18736.06s]  No, I'm gonna prevent that from happening.
[18736.70s -> 18739.97s]  A vet will be with you soon to examine and treat your sick pet.
[18739.97s -> 18740.69s]  Please be patient.
[18747.63s -> 18748.03s]  So where's...
[18750.78s -> 18751.74s]  Get pet examined.
[18753.26s -> 18754.30s]  Who's examining the pet?
[18755.26s -> 18758.35s]  Oh, he's going up there now.
[18758.35s -> 18758.59s]  Okay.
[18759.39s -> 18765.04s]  Of course, the vet.
[18766.08s -> 18766.96s]  Has cat ears.
[18768.13s -> 18768.37s]  Really?
[18771.41s -> 18772.05s]  Are you serious?
[18783.87s -> 18784.43s]  Pet examined.
[18784.43s -> 18787.47s]  Looks like 8 has woozy-kiddiitis.
[18787.47s -> 18788.99s]  Which option would you like to have?
[18790.45s -> 18791.25s]  Expensive treatment.
[18791.25s -> 18794.13s]  Spare no expense and cure your pet with the best medicine available.
[18796.16s -> 18799.94s]  I'm so used to seeing dogs, man.
[18801.98s -> 18802.38s]  All right.
[18803.54s -> 18804.66s]  Back to normal.
[18804.66s -> 18806.70s]  We're good.
[18808.05s -> 18808.61s]  Thank you.
[18812.75s -> 18813.47s]  Back to normal.
[18818.45s -> 18819.25s]  All right.
[18819.25s -> 18820.13s]  We can go home now.
[18821.01s -> 18824.30s]  What's the sad music for?
[18825.42s -> 18826.06s]  What's going on?
[18828.93s -> 18829.73s]  Sad music.
[18833.92s -> 18834.96s]  That was kind of scary.
[18837.52s -> 18838.40s]  You got one too.
[18838.40s -> 18838.72s]  Okay.
[18839.44s -> 18840.00s]  Both armed.
[18845.95s -> 18847.71s]  Wait, death just got arrested?
[18859.02s -> 18860.46s]  I don't even know what that was.
[18860.62s -> 18861.68s]  What about the kitty?
[18864.13s -> 18864.93s]  No, stop.
[18865.97s -> 18866.77s]  Stop, stop it.
[18879.17s -> 18880.69s]  The dog is just like here.
[18888.21s -> 18890.42s]  How do I get him out of jail?
[18894.34s -> 18896.26s]  You're going to jump up and eat the treats?
[18903.50s -> 18904.78s]  I'm going to get him out of jail.
[18904.78s -> 18905.74s]  I'm going to get him out of jail.
[18905.74s -> 18906.70s]  I'm going to get him out of jail.
[18906.70s -> 18917.78s]  I can't.
[18918.58s -> 18919.14s]  I can't.
[18920.82s -> 18921.62s]  No, I can't.
[18938.40s -> 18939.44s]  I have to stop that.
[18939.44s -> 18940.40s]  I have to stop that.
[18941.20s -> 18942.40s]  I have to stop that joke.
[18942.40s -> 18943.04s]  It's not...
[18943.04s -> 18944.16s]  We did it too many times.
[18945.20s -> 18946.80s]  I've done that too many times.
[18948.50s -> 18950.26s]  There are no more vets.
[18953.73s -> 18954.29s]  All right.
[18954.29s -> 18954.69s]  All right.
[18954.69s -> 18955.89s]  No, it's not funny anymore.
[18955.89s -> 18956.21s]  I'm out.
[18956.21s -> 18956.93s]  Get me out of here.
[18956.93s -> 18957.65s]  Go home.
[18957.65s -> 18965.25s]  Why is he taking a picture?
[18967.31s -> 18968.51s]  Does the cat know how to go home?
[18969.07s -> 18974.53s]  It's going to arrest the cat.
[18976.13s -> 18977.33s]  No, you can't arrest the cat.
[18999.28s -> 19000.72s]  I need to get this cat back home.
[19002.00s -> 19003.98s]  But nobody can...
[19003.98s -> 19005.10s]  Somebody's going to pick the cat up.
[19006.38s -> 19007.90s]  I'm in a different world right now.
[19008.70s -> 19012.59s]  What's Jerma doing?
[19012.59s -> 19014.11s]  I don't know, but at home.
[19015.57s -> 19017.25s]  Okay, you need to come get this cat.
[19019.95s -> 19021.06s]  Stop shooting.
[19021.86s -> 19023.22s]  Oh, this is bad.
[19023.22s -> 19023.70s]  Why am I...
[19024.58s -> 19026.98s]  What was that?
[19027.70s -> 19029.94s]  Am I covered in blood?
[19033.41s -> 19034.69s]  Is death going to take my cat?
[19040.66s -> 19045.86s]  I need to get you home.
[19049.49s -> 19050.85s]  That's a bad idea.
[19050.85s -> 19051.73s]  Don't attack death.
[19054.88s -> 19055.60s]  All right, go.
[19056.48s -> 19060.61s]  Let's focus on switch control.
[19063.87s -> 19065.15s]  I got to pull that cat back.
[19065.71s -> 19077.89s]  All right.
[19077.89s -> 19079.58s]  Cat, call over.
[19082.69s -> 19085.79s]  The cat brought two friends, I guess.
[19087.73s -> 19088.13s]  All right.
[19088.77s -> 19089.57s]  Invite over.
[19091.65s -> 19092.69s]  Funny introduction.
[19092.69s -> 19093.49s]  Welcome to the house.
[19094.21s -> 19097.62s]  It's time to have a party.
[19098.26s -> 19100.72s]  How do I get you out of jail?
[19100.72s -> 19104.32s]  How are you still at the hospital?
[19117.17s -> 19117.65s]  Where is he?
[19129.50s -> 19131.58s]  On the computer at the vet's.
[19135.42s -> 19136.30s]  We got two more vets.
[19136.30s -> 19136.62s]  We're good.
[19142.18s -> 19142.90s]  Cat is home.
[19142.90s -> 19143.70s]  Everyone's home.
[19143.70s -> 19144.74s]  Time for you to go home, too.
[19152.46s -> 19153.74s]  He's about to make a coffee again.
[19158.16s -> 19159.04s]  Oh, my God.
[19162.54s -> 19164.38s]  No, just get out of here.
[19165.10s -> 19171.82s]  Just make your exit.
[19177.28s -> 19177.60s]  Home.
[19178.40s -> 19178.88s]  Goodbye.
[19180.00s -> 19182.14s]  All right.
[19182.14s -> 19183.34s]  Thank you for treating my animal.
[19184.80s -> 19185.60s]  Let's get control.
[19186.16s -> 19189.23s]  Let's switch control to Jeremy Reinhardt.
[19200.10s -> 19200.74s]  All right.
[19200.74s -> 19205.66s]  The pets are doing just fine.
[19206.62s -> 19207.34s]  Everyone's okay.
[19207.34s -> 19207.74s]  Let's check.
[19207.74s -> 19209.18s]  Let's actually check on traits here.
[19209.18s -> 19210.22s]  Let's make some food.
[19211.46s -> 19212.42s]  Enough with the bullshit.
[19213.38s -> 19215.66s]  Let's make some food.
[19215.66s -> 19219.23s]  I don't know who this is,
[19222.58s -> 19224.26s]  but they are currently in my house.
[19224.82s -> 19233.81s]  Oh, you're watching the people burn and fires video again, right?
[19233.81s -> 19234.29s]  That's great.
[19236.48s -> 19237.76s]  I guess I'm going to introduce myself.
[19244.93s -> 19246.13s]  How did the Grim Reaper die?
[19249.30s -> 19249.80s]  What?
[19253.60s -> 19255.28s]  Somebody killed the Grim Reaper in here.
[19260.75s -> 19261.55s]  Go home.
[19268.27s -> 19268.77s]  All right.
[19269.95s -> 19270.43s]  Hungry.
[19270.43s -> 19271.87s]  It's time to make food.
[19275.01s -> 19275.51s]  Cook.
[19276.34s -> 19276.82s]  A meal.
[19276.82s -> 19277.94s]  I already have a party here.
[19277.94s -> 19278.66s]  Hire staff.
[19279.62s -> 19282.37s]  Cook a grand meal.
[19282.37s -> 19284.93s]  I'm going to make a turkey dinner.
[19295.36s -> 19296.88s]  Nice things are happening, I guess.
[19296.88s -> 19303.97s]  Tofurky.
[19303.97s -> 19305.41s]  Wait, what the hell is Tofurky?
[19306.05s -> 19308.56s]  I have no clue.
[19311.28s -> 19312.08s]  That's all you need to do.
[19313.09s -> 19316.90s]  First to die, just kill somebody.
[19316.90s -> 19317.40s]  What?
[19321.33s -> 19321.83s]  Why?
[19334.77s -> 19337.81s]  Technically, he was first to die.
[19346.90s -> 19355.87s]  He was out of control.
[19355.87s -> 19356.37s]  He was.
[19363.14s -> 19366.11s]  All right.
[19366.11s -> 19368.19s]  Can I make a grand meal, please?
[19380.30s -> 19381.02s]  Okay, can we...
[19382.96s -> 19384.24s]  Don't forget about the Tofurky.
[19384.24s -> 19384.74s]  Right.
[19384.96s -> 19385.84s]  I was going to say, why?
[19393.15s -> 19394.27s]  Get out of the turkey.
[19395.22s -> 19396.10s]  I can't even click it.
[19398.32s -> 19398.82s]  Resume.
[19400.10s -> 19400.66s]  Turkey dinner.
[19406.67s -> 19407.87s]  Are you eating out of the bowl?
[19414.29s -> 19415.17s]  This is so cute.
[19416.77s -> 19417.81s]  It really is.
[19417.81s -> 19419.17s]  This is absolutely adorable.
[19425.89s -> 19427.17s]  And what was the photo?
[19427.17s -> 19428.29s]  Did I add money?
[19429.01s -> 19430.70s]  I think I put money in here.
[19431.42s -> 19435.01s]  My secret ingredient is money.
[19449.70s -> 19450.82s]  This is not a turkey.
[19454.14s -> 19455.02s]  At all.
[19455.02s -> 19456.38s]  This is a bowl of tomato.
[19457.26s -> 19457.90s]  Paste.
[19457.90s -> 19458.40s]  And that's it.
[19463.10s -> 19464.38s]  It's tofu turkey.
[19465.86s -> 19466.36s]  Really?
[19469.50s -> 19470.22s]  Oh, what?
[19470.78s -> 19471.28s]  Okay.
[19471.90s -> 19477.39s]  You can turn the oven on?
[19478.27s -> 19480.08s]  That's not how you turn an oven on.
[19480.80s -> 19482.16s]  It is a notch on the top right.
[19483.12s -> 19485.02s]  I just threw a lime in there.
[19489.98s -> 19490.62s]  Turn on the oven.
[19496.82s -> 19497.46s]  It's already on.
[19498.26s -> 19498.76s]  Okay.
[19505.33s -> 19506.99s]  So it looks pretty good.
[19506.99s -> 19507.49s]  Yeah, it does.
[19509.95s -> 19511.47s]  Did somebody just throw a glass at me?
[19512.83s -> 19513.79s]  What the fuck was that?
[19519.73s -> 19520.23s]  There it is.
[19523.20s -> 19524.00s]  Who's hungry?
[19524.64s -> 19528.64s]  I've got a Tufurki dinner.
[19547.39s -> 19549.23s]  I killed the vegetarian.
[19554.66s -> 19556.18s]  Did I actually kill the vegetarian?
[19556.82s -> 19561.38s]  I'm just sitting down.
[19564.58s -> 19565.62s]  Where's Doug?
[19567.38s -> 19574.51s]  I think me and death are having a flirty conversation.
[19578.86s -> 19582.37s]  I need to see what the hell you're doing up here.
[19582.69s -> 19583.19s]  Where are you?
[19583.81s -> 19589.01s]  Why do they always do this?
[19590.77s -> 19591.57s]  Just go home.
[19591.57s -> 19593.33s]  Why would you sleep on a park bench?
[19597.95s -> 19599.07s]  Like, go home.
[19599.07s -> 19603.50s]  What are you doing?
[19603.50s -> 19603.82s]  All right.
[19603.82s -> 19604.30s]  We're good.
[19604.86s -> 19605.42s]  How's the cat?
[19608.06s -> 19608.86s]  Pretty good, actually.
[19610.34s -> 19610.74s]  Dog?
[19610.74s -> 19611.14s]  Bladder?
[19611.14s -> 19611.62s]  Where's the dog?
[19612.18s -> 19618.18s]  Have you eaten?
[19618.98s -> 19620.58s]  Dog needs to go to the bathroom.
[19620.58s -> 19622.18s]  This is first to die.
[19622.18s -> 19625.06s]  This is Akira and Miko.
[19630.54s -> 19631.58s]  Mourning a friend.
[19634.10s -> 19634.90s]  Oh, right.
[19634.90s -> 19635.54s]  First to die.
[19635.54s -> 19642.66s]  I think it's time.
[19642.66s -> 19643.46s]  We gotta clean this up.
[19647.81s -> 19649.17s]  Release all these spirits.
[19650.13s -> 19651.41s]  Release, release, release.
[19654.91s -> 19656.11s]  Release this one, too.
[19656.11s -> 19656.99s]  Get them all out of here.
[19661.14s -> 19661.86s]  Yeah, get out.
[19662.66s -> 19662.98s]  Out.
[19678.61s -> 19679.41s]  All right, come eat.
[19688.16s -> 19689.68s]  Cat was eating out of the...
[19690.24s -> 19690.80s]  It's all right.
[19691.68s -> 19700.06s]  You are the most fucked up person out of everybody.
[19700.06s -> 19700.56s]  I swear.
[19704.14s -> 19704.54s]  You just...
[19704.54s -> 19705.98s]  I give you a task and you just don't do it.
[19711.94s -> 19712.82s]  Well, fucking whatever.
[19715.47s -> 19715.87s]  All right.
[19715.87s -> 19717.07s]  Dog, cat, everybody's good.
[19720.29s -> 19723.84s]  Oh, getting you mail?
[19724.86s -> 19725.98s]  Do we have mail?
[19725.98s -> 19726.46s]  Oh, shit.
[19726.46s -> 19727.02s]  We have mail.
[19727.74s -> 19735.14s]  The urns are blocking the way.
[19736.11s -> 19749.34s]  Oh, we'll just get rid of them.
[19749.34s -> 19749.66s]  What?
[19749.66s -> 19751.42s]  I heard bad sounds?

[21348.74s -> 21349.94s]  Let's get some drinks served.
[21349.94s -> 21350.26s]  All right.

[21361.64s -> 21364.76s]  Uh-oh.
[21364.76s -> 21367.52s]  Oh, he's on a spiritual journey.
[21367.52s -> 21368.16s]  Right, right, right.
[21421.19s -> 21422.39s]  I can't lock the door.
[21424.53s -> 21425.09s]  Oh, I can't.
[21425.09s -> 21425.41s]  I can't.
[21426.29s -> 21430.76s]  Where is he?
[21431.56s -> 21433.68s]  Why is everybody freaking out about him?
[21434.40s -> 21434.72s]  Wait.
[21435.52s -> 21439.83s]  Where is he?
[21439.91s -> 21440.71s]  Where's the blueberry?
[21441.35s -> 21445.67s]  What happened?
[21446.39s -> 21447.11s]  What happened?
[21448.16s -> 21449.44s]  What happened?
[21449.44s -> 21450.48s]  What's he doing?
[21451.44s -> 21458.36s]  Why is everybody so pissed?
[21470.60s -> 21474.52s]  Barry feels as if he's being pulled out of his body into another realm.
[21474.52s -> 21479.64s]  A presence of a benevolent entity appears who telepathically communicates
[21479.64s -> 21487.52s]  that she wishes to guide Barry around the astral place.
[21487.52s -> 21493.51s]  Follow.
[21493.51s -> 21497.03s]  Barry finds himself outside a hut with sandals outside.
[21497.03s -> 21500.31s]  An overwhelming feeling that someone sacred lives there
[21500.31s -> 21500.87s]  takes hold.
[21500.87s -> 21503.27s]  A much older version of Barry emerges from the hut.
[21503.27s -> 21504.55s]  What should Barry do?
[21505.43s -> 21508.39s]  What is your purpose?
[21509.03s -> 21519.48s]  The old man's expression changes from kind smile to berating gaze.
[21519.48s -> 21519.96s]  He speaks,
[21520.52s -> 21522.92s]  My purpose has nothing to do with why you are here.
[21522.92s -> 21524.92s]  This is a sacred place of self-realization.
[21524.92s -> 21525.56s]  You're not ready.
[21526.60s -> 21532.02s]  That's annoying.
[21542.45s -> 21543.01s]  Let's go.
[21543.01s -> 21543.73s]  Let's go.
[21543.73s -> 21543.97s]  What?
[21543.97s -> 21545.09s]  And cooking level one.
[21545.09s -> 21546.13s]  Who has cooking level one?
[21548.93s -> 21552.31s]  Any idiots have cooking level one?
[21555.00s -> 21555.96s]  Oh, god damn it.
[21555.96s -> 21556.52s]  Really?
[21556.52s -> 21563.99s]  What?
[21563.99s -> 21564.23s]  Why?
[21564.87s -> 21569.22s]  I don't have any weed.
[21584.63s -> 21599.03s]  Very competent.
[21602.66s -> 21603.94s]  Buy weed from the computer.
[21603.94s -> 21604.98s]  Put your clothes back on.
[21606.02s -> 21615.51s]  She was happy, but wait a minute.
[21616.55s -> 21625.06s]  Get up.
[21635.40s -> 21636.76s]  We did it.
[21667.40s -> 21669.88s]  Hey, no, try for baby.
[21671.08s -> 21671.72s]  What happened?
[21671.88s -> 21672.84s]  What are you doing?
[21687.16s -> 21689.16s]  We just started dating.
[21689.16s -> 21690.52s]  Try for a baby.
[21691.96s -> 21699.94s]  Hey, the first time I kiss you, you want to have a baby?
[21702.18s -> 21706.36s]  I can't do first person.
[21707.00s -> 21707.56s]  I can't.
[21708.20s -> 21711.25s]  No, I can't do first person.
[21712.05s -> 21727.78s]  This isn't even our house.
[21730.21s -> 21740.92s]  Man.
[21741.72s -> 21743.16s]  No, look, it's pretend, see?
[21743.80s -> 21746.50s]  Not even our house.
[21746.50s -> 21747.30s]  Not even our house.
[21756.05s -> 21758.13s]  Here's the thing that I can't comprehend.
[21758.13s -> 21762.39s]  Where is the guy who owns this apartment?
[21763.54s -> 21766.02s]  I just had sex in his bed.
[21775.86s -> 21792.55s]  Here's the apartment key to this apartment to this one.
[21792.55s -> 21794.79s]  Here's the key to this apartment.
[21794.79s -> 21798.44s]  Okay, hold on.
[21798.44s -> 21799.80s]  More choices.
[21799.80s -> 21800.36s]  Romance.
[21802.08s -> 21802.96s]  Ask to be girlfriend.
[21802.96s -> 21803.60s]  Come on.
[21803.60s -> 21804.88s]  Let's make a baby.
[21804.88s -> 21813.22s]  Here we go.
[21814.02s -> 21820.32s]  All right, now girlfriend just became girlfriend of Peter.
[21821.12s -> 21826.82s]  Attempt more choices.
[21826.82s -> 21827.14s]  Come on.
[21831.92s -> 21832.40s]  What's wrong?
[21833.73s -> 21835.01s]  Why is everybody staring?
[21836.55s -> 21837.51s]  You want to try for a baby?
[21840.77s -> 21844.12s]  Let's try for a baby this time.
[21849.35s -> 21850.23s]  No, that's awful.
[21850.23s -> 21850.63s]  No, no, no.
[21850.63s -> 21852.15s]  I'm not going to like have him go in there.
[21852.87s -> 21858.77s]  All right, we're not going to see it.
[21858.77s -> 21859.81s]  Look, we're going to go this way.
[21868.80s -> 21870.98s]  Okay, we're good.
[21870.98s -> 21872.34s]  Break out the candles, make it romantic.
[21872.34s -> 21873.54s]  Peter is about to woohoo.
[21888.52s -> 21889.32s]  It didn't work.
[21891.38s -> 21892.10s]  It didn't work.
[21892.10s -> 21892.98s]  I have to get that off.
[21893.54s -> 21906.37s]  All right, did it work?
[21906.37s -> 21918.77s]  Baby and baby.
[21919.41s -> 21919.97s]  No, baby.
[21921.41s -> 21928.28s]  Did it work?
[21928.28s -> 21949.33s]  I have to do a pregnancy test.
[21949.33s -> 21949.97s]  Since when?
[21961.99s -> 21963.67s]  Why does she have money come all up?
[21964.47s -> 21966.47s]  You're getting in.
[21968.47s -> 21969.35s]  Okay, all right, all right.
[21969.35s -> 21970.07s]  Slow down here.
[21972.20s -> 21974.58s]  I have no control.
[21974.58s -> 21975.30s]  I don't have control.
[21976.02s -> 21978.69s]  Where did she go?
[21979.33s -> 21984.08s]  All right, get this thing out of here.
[21986.60s -> 21987.48s]  I can't even sell it.
[21988.04s -> 21989.24s]  I don't have access to this house.
[21990.79s -> 21991.51s]  Oh, shit.
[21992.74s -> 21994.02s]  Clear out, clear out, clear out.

[21995.22s -> 21999.38s]  Out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out.

[22056.39s -> 22056.79s]  Oh, shit.
[22056.79s -> 22057.19s]  She's back.
[22060.28s -> 22062.28s]  I think she really thinks this is my house.
[22062.92s -> 22068.69s]  He doesn't even know.
[22068.69s -> 22069.57s]  I try to get everybody out.
[22070.37s -> 22073.59s]  Does she have his key?
[22080.07s -> 22080.55s]  What?
[22080.55s -> 22084.28s]  Oh, God.
[22084.28s -> 22084.68s]  Oh, God.
[22084.68s -> 22085.00s]  Oh, God.
[22085.00s -> 22085.16s]  Oh, God.
[22085.16s -> 22085.72s]  I don't know what to do.
[22086.52s -> 22087.76s]  I don't know what to do.
[22089.19s -> 22089.91s]  I don't know what to do.
[22094.13s -> 22095.33s]  He's got the drug cup.
[22095.89s -> 22101.32s]  This dude is dressed like the Riddler from Batman Forever.
[22101.32s -> 22104.13s]  Does he think, oh, yeah, I must have done this.
[22104.13s -> 22107.70s]  He's noticing it now.
[22123.44s -> 22134.69s]  It's our house now.
[22134.69s -> 22148.79s]  All right, that's OP as hell.
[22148.79s -> 22149.91s]  This whole thing is just fucked up.
[22149.91s -> 22151.67s]  All right, where's the magic mirror?
[22151.67s -> 22153.19s]  The magic ghost mirror?
[22156.18s -> 22157.54s]  All right, everybody back out.
[22157.54s -> 22158.90s]  Everybody back to the house.
[22183.04s -> 22183.84s]  That was awful.
[22183.84s -> 22184.48s]  It's okay, though.
[22184.48s -> 22187.89s]  All right, bring everybody back here.
[22189.38s -> 22190.98s]  We'll have a party here now.
[22190.98s -> 22193.91s]  Bring people here.
[22196.47s -> 22197.35s]  Bring here.
[22198.07s -> 22204.37s]  Bring them all here.
[22204.37s -> 22205.09s]  Everybody's here.
[22205.73s -> 22207.81s]  Here's the magic scary mirror.
[22208.93s -> 22210.53s]  Chant the bride's name.
[22210.53s -> 22211.73s]  Admire a new possession.
[22211.73s -> 22212.53s]  Protect self.
[22212.53s -> 22214.21s]  Chant multiple brides' names.
[22221.68s -> 22223.52s]  Well, here's what we're going to do.
[22226.79s -> 22230.21s]  We're going to invite everybody over here again.
[22230.21s -> 22230.85s]  What time is it?
[22230.85s -> 22231.49s]  Everybody.
[22231.49s -> 22232.05s]  How's everybody?
[22232.77s -> 22233.81s]  How are you doing?
[22234.61s -> 22234.93s]  Energy.
[22235.57s -> 22237.25s]  Tomorrow, we're going to have some people sleep.
[22241.06s -> 22245.94s]  And tomorrow, throw a party and then have Bloody Mary show up.
[22246.50s -> 22257.08s]  There's also the chaos book, too.
[22257.08s -> 22257.56s]  That's true.
[22259.30s -> 22262.32s]  I didn't have a bed, don't I?
[22262.32s -> 22263.36s]  People need to be energized.
[22263.36s -> 22264.64s]  I don't want people falling asleep.
[22266.48s -> 22268.96s]  You know what I mean?
[22268.96s -> 22270.48s]  Just go to bed on that couch right now.
[22273.25s -> 22274.85s]  I need to figure out how to get clothes on him again.
[22282.34s -> 22283.30s]  Sleep on the cat bed.
[22285.65s -> 22286.13s]  All right.
[22286.13s -> 22286.85s]  Everybody asleep?
[22289.20s -> 22289.92s]  How are we all doing?
[22291.94s -> 22293.94s]  Hey, I heard you became friends with Aya.
[22293.94s -> 22294.66s]  She's pretty cool.
[22294.66s -> 22295.46s]  That's my girlfriend.
[22298.36s -> 22298.68s]  Are you?
[22298.68s -> 22299.48s]  Yeah, you're asleep.
[22301.97s -> 22303.01s]  All right, everyone's almost there.
[22303.89s -> 22305.01s]  You're in the bed, too, right?
[22305.01s -> 22305.65s]  Okay, sleep.
[22309.00s -> 22310.36s]  Can I adopt the rat?
[22310.36s -> 22311.00s]  I don't think so.
[22316.21s -> 22317.57s]  Yeah, I use the genie.
[22322.84s -> 22324.12s]  All right, here we go.
[22326.88s -> 22327.92s]  Are you ready?
[22327.92s -> 22330.45s]  Time to throw a party.
[22331.91s -> 22333.43s]  Here comes a real murder mystery.
[22334.15s -> 22337.12s]  I'm going to get everybody here.
[22337.12s -> 22337.92s]  I'm going to lock the door
[22337.92s -> 22340.32s]  and I'm going to chant in front of the mirror.
[22345.56s -> 22346.68s]  I have no idea what's going to happen.
[22352.82s -> 22355.81s]  You get a club to join?
[22361.38s -> 22368.56s]  It's a Dragon Ball Z character.
[22368.56s -> 22376.31s]  What's wrong with you?
[22377.19s -> 22383.38s]  Where am I?
[22383.38s -> 22389.86s]  All right, set party through the phone.
[22393.51s -> 22394.71s]  Play a game, take a photo,
[22400.63s -> 22402.31s]  chat with, plan a social event.
[22408.69s -> 22409.57s]  A lot of people are already here.
[22415.70s -> 22417.14s]  Incognito costume party.
[22419.46s -> 22420.34s]  House party.
[22420.34s -> 22421.62s]  Yeah, house party.
[22422.34s -> 22424.12s]  I'm the host.
[22425.49s -> 22429.20s]  Me, here are a couple of guests.
[22430.08s -> 22432.23s]  Just these two.
[22432.79s -> 22434.87s]  Entertainer, hire somebody.
[22435.43s -> 22436.87s]  Mixologist, hire somebody.
[22437.83s -> 22439.03s]  Caterer, hire somebody.
[22440.64s -> 22442.24s]  Location is right here.
[22443.41s -> 22445.17s]  Wait, I know that this is my house.
[22445.17s -> 22447.62s]  Okay, let's go.
[22450.87s -> 22451.51s]  Dance party.
[22452.07s -> 22455.04s]  Just wait till everybody shows up.
[22455.04s -> 22455.60s]  I need food.
[22474.24s -> 22474.56s]  Bye.
[22476.64s -> 22477.84s]  All right, lock the door.
[22477.84s -> 22479.20s]  Lock the door, lock the door, lock the door.
[22481.32s -> 22482.68s]  You really just jumped the gun there.
[22484.60s -> 22485.88s]  Oh, come on.
[22485.88s -> 22487.48s]  No, stop fighting.
[22487.48s -> 22488.12s]  Where's the door?
[22496.04s -> 22496.68s]  Get in here.
[22497.40s -> 22507.22s]  Why did you do that?
[22507.22s -> 22508.42s]  What was the point of that?
[22508.42s -> 22510.18s]  We were, nobody even got in there yet.
[22530.24s -> 22531.12s]  This is lagging so much.
[22534.07s -> 22534.63s]  That's why.
[22536.68s -> 22537.48s]  Motherfuckers.
[22537.48s -> 22537.80s]  All right.
[22539.92s -> 22540.88s]  Lock door.
[22541.84s -> 22542.96s]  For everyone.
[22552.23s -> 22552.55s]  Okay.
[22554.80s -> 22555.76s]  Wait, who's this guy?
[22556.48s -> 22559.57s]  Get in here.
[22561.41s -> 22565.09s]  Allow access to Pauline.
[22571.19s -> 22571.75s]  Oh, fuck it.
[22571.75s -> 22572.79s]  That person's just gonna stay out there.
[22572.79s -> 22573.51s]  Everybody lock it.
[22574.66s -> 22577.14s]  All right, it's a dark and stormy night.
[22577.14s -> 22579.38s]  We have a handful of people in here.
[22581.16s -> 22583.70s]  Who wants to chant into the mirror?
[22583.70s -> 22585.30s]  How about blueberry?
[22586.18s -> 22587.62s]  Chant multiple brides' names.
[22602.56s -> 22607.75s]  Let's come over and hit this lady.
[22608.39s -> 22608.95s]  I don't get it.
[22611.43s -> 22612.71s]  Oh no, I get it.
[22617.80s -> 22618.60s]  Oh my God.
[22621.97s -> 22626.24s]  Oh, where's she going?
[22633.01s -> 22633.33s]  What?
[22638.00s -> 22638.72s]  Holy shit.
[22650.21s -> 22651.17s]  Nobody cares.
[22651.89s -> 22653.09s]  Now she's crying.
[22667.86s -> 22668.74s]  Who's out here?
[22671.62s -> 22673.30s]  Who's out there on the cell phone?
[22681.01s -> 22683.09s]  This is a lot more anti-climactic than I thought.
[22684.85s -> 22685.33s]  What?
[22685.33s -> 22686.13s]  Who just punched me?
[22688.45s -> 22689.01s]  Fuck off.
[22695.78s -> 22696.10s]  What?
[22696.10s -> 22696.42s]  Deal.
[22700.55s -> 22710.02s]  This is only when the chainsaw is still in the house.
[22710.98s -> 22712.02s]  Where's Bloody Mary?
[22719.99s -> 22720.95s]  Why am I outside?
[22730.82s -> 22731.22s]  All right.
[22731.22s -> 22731.94s]  You suck.
[22736.71s -> 22738.07s]  You're not even scary.
[22755.20s -> 22759.99s]  You're not even scary.
[22769.65s -> 22772.77s]  Is everybody hungry?
[22776.76s -> 22782.34s]  Get me away from the first person.
[22788.20s -> 22790.04s]  Am I gonna get arrested for killing the lady?
[22792.95s -> 22794.71s]  This is me getting in trouble.
[22794.71s -> 22795.67s]  Arrested for murder.
[22796.47s -> 22805.06s]  The cops can't even get in.
[22805.06s -> 22810.95s]  What?
[22810.95s -> 22811.83s]  What the fuck?
[22812.47s -> 22816.32s]  I don't understand what I'm seeing here.
[22820.63s -> 22823.84s]  Who just died?
[22824.24s -> 22826.24s]  It's a random person, I think.
[22826.88s -> 22831.08s]  So you can't kill her.
[22831.08s -> 22831.32s]  Okay.
[22835.78s -> 22837.14s]  I need to tell some jokes.
[22838.02s -> 22839.60s]  You're going straight to hell.
[22874.00s -> 22874.96s]  Start a fire.
[22881.36s -> 22883.12s]  There's just spawning in the town.
[22883.84s -> 22891.67s]  Hey.
[22891.67s -> 22898.98s]  This guy has a gun.
[22905.91s -> 22906.87s]  This lady.
[22907.91s -> 22909.83s]  Why is the genie here?
[22909.83s -> 22912.23s]  Why is it coming over here?
[22919.56s -> 22920.76s]  Good work.
[22920.76s -> 22921.40s]  You did it.
[22925.12s -> 22930.00s]  Where's the book?
[22931.65s -> 22932.61s]  They can't even get in the door.
[22933.41s -> 22936.63s]  The door is dead.
[22937.52s -> 22938.48s]  The door is locked.
[22938.48s -> 22939.36s]  Nobody can even get in.
[22940.00s -> 22943.88s]  All right.
[22943.88s -> 22944.44s]  Where's the book?
[22945.00s -> 22946.31s]  Wasn't there a book?
[22946.31s -> 22947.19s]  Where's the bookcase?
[22950.64s -> 22951.36s]  Read something.
[22953.89s -> 22954.21s]  Open.
[22955.41s -> 22955.81s]  Here it is.
[22956.45s -> 22957.49s]  The book of chaos.
[22959.32s -> 22960.52s]  Read the book of chaos.
[22969.17s -> 22969.89s]  Do you have it?
[22969.89s -> 22970.37s]  Where are you?
[22980.64s -> 22982.16s]  I can't even open the door.
[22982.16s -> 22982.80s]  Paul, wait.
[22982.80s -> 22983.60s]  Hold on.
[22983.60s -> 22985.12s]  Wasn't Paul the only one that could open the door?
[22985.76s -> 22987.22s]  All right.
[22987.22s -> 22987.70s]  Unlock it.
[22989.27s -> 22989.67s]  Unlock.
[22989.67s -> 22990.47s]  Everybody can come in now.
[22990.47s -> 22996.69s]  Get in.
[22996.69s -> 22998.21s]  Read the book of chaos.
[22998.21s -> 23000.12s]  Okay.
[23000.12s -> 23008.77s]  Now I can lock the door.
[23008.77s -> 23009.81s]  What the hell does this do?
[23012.34s -> 23015.43s]  Did somebody eat a piece of cake?
[23019.65s -> 23020.53s]  Don't worry, everybody.
[23020.53s -> 23024.31s]  I'll just open up the book of chaos and read it.
[23025.03s -> 23027.24s]  Did I not read it?
[23027.88s -> 23030.07s]  Am I taking it into the bathroom?
[23036.04s -> 23037.40s]  I wanted a better place to read.
[23038.04s -> 23041.32s]  Read it.
[23041.32s -> 23050.93s]  What happens when you read the whole thing?
[23073.57s -> 23074.37s]  What's going on?
[23074.37s -> 23075.01s]  Do something.
[23082.76s -> 23083.64s]  What happens here?
[23088.34s -> 23089.30s]  You're just crying.
[23090.66s -> 23093.64s]  I'm sorry.
[23103.88s -> 23105.24s]  I just had to make something happen.
[23107.32s -> 23108.52s]  This book doesn't do anything.
[23109.76s -> 23110.80s]  He can't read.
[23111.60s -> 23113.28s]  He's just pointing at the lines.
[23113.28s -> 23114.64s]  Oh, this one looks bright.
[23114.64s -> 23116.00s]  This one's different colored.
[23116.64s -> 23126.12s]  Look, he actually has to...
[23126.12s -> 23134.13s]  You all right?
[23135.73s -> 23136.05s]  Okay.
[23139.84s -> 23142.80s]  Guys, he actually has to learn how to read.
[23142.80s -> 23144.24s]  He has to learn to read first.
[23150.95s -> 23151.75s]  Galarga!
[23154.72s -> 23158.98s]  Nepha learned how to read.
[23158.98s -> 23160.50s]  Reading like the Necronomicon.
[23167.36s -> 23168.96s]  Just you wait when he's done finishing
[23168.96s -> 23170.40s]  and figuring out how to read this book.
[23171.12s -> 23172.32s]  All right, let's go make a baby.
[23173.04s -> 23174.08s]  Where is she?
[23177.49s -> 23180.68s]  All right, more choices.
[23180.68s -> 23181.40s]  Try for a baby.
[23181.96s -> 23189.16s]  Come on.
[23190.18s -> 23191.30s]  You finished reading the book?
[23195.16s -> 23196.76s]  Violence and Barry is violent.
[23198.28s -> 23201.14s]  Try for a baby.
[23201.46s -> 23214.36s]  Shift-click the ground to start a fire anywhere.
[23217.44s -> 23218.16s]  I don't have that.
[23218.72s -> 23221.43s]  Anybody in this bed?
[23227.41s -> 23227.91s]  Come on!
[23228.85s -> 23229.35s]  Where'd he go?
[23243.33s -> 23243.83s]  Let's go.
[23246.47s -> 23249.77s]  Okay.
[23250.63s -> 23251.67s]  I want a baby out of that.
[23254.63s -> 23255.99s]  You finished reading the book yet?
[23257.30s -> 23257.80s]  Where is it?
[23258.42s -> 23260.20s]  You don't just put a book like that down on the ground.
[23261.00s -> 23265.32s]  Where is it?
[23269.88s -> 23270.68s]  Oh, shit.
[23270.68s -> 23271.18s]  Where is it?
[23271.72s -> 23274.79s]  Somebody take it?
[23275.51s -> 23282.96s]  Where is everybody?
[23289.78s -> 23291.30s]  Carpet by the front door.
[23298.64s -> 23299.36s]  Baby?
[23299.36s -> 23304.79s]  What are you doing?
[23307.51s -> 23308.31s]  Oh, it's right here.
[23312.02s -> 23313.46s]  Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[23313.46s -> 23314.10s]  Wait a minute.
[23314.10s -> 23315.46s]  Drown a Sim in pee.
[23317.30s -> 23318.26s]  Don't read that.
[23318.90s -> 23319.78s]  Don't read that.
[23319.78s -> 23320.28s]  Don't.
[23320.50s -> 23321.00s]  Hold on.
[23321.54s -> 23331.17s]  Who am I torturing?
[23338.56s -> 23339.36s]  Get that book back.
[23344.32s -> 23349.06s]  All right, put it down.
[23349.94s -> 23352.21s]  Okay, freeze Sim.
[23354.79s -> 23356.15s]  Uh, who's even up here?
[23356.15s -> 23356.95s]  Who's up here still?
[23357.84s -> 23358.64s]  This lady right here.
[23359.28s -> 23360.93s]  What does that do?
[23361.65s -> 23363.25s]  Do you actually just freeze them?
[23363.25s -> 23364.45s]  Like cold freeze them?
[23368.52s -> 23369.02s]  Holy shit.
[23370.36s -> 23370.86s]  Is she dead?
[23387.08s -> 23388.28s]  No, somebody picked it up again.
[23405.70s -> 23406.20s]  Bingo.
[23441.57s -> 23442.61s]  Is this person still alive?
[23445.35s -> 23445.83s]  Hello?
[23445.83s -> 23447.27s]  Hey, like I haven't been talking.
[23448.37s -> 23450.37s]  Hey, hey, hey, wait up.
[23450.37s -> 23451.33s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[23453.11s -> 23454.15s]  Excuse me.
[23454.15s -> 23455.59s]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[23455.59s -> 23456.09s]  Stop it.
[23457.11s -> 23457.61s]  You.
[23458.31s -> 23458.63s]  Get it.
[23458.63s -> 23459.19s]  You're done.
[23459.19s -> 23459.51s]  That's it.
[23459.51s -> 23460.31s]  That's enough out of you.
[23462.13s -> 23462.93s]  That's it from you.
[23474.42s -> 23475.30s]  They're both dead?
[23475.86s -> 23476.36s]  No.
[23478.02s -> 23478.74s]  Both dead.
[23479.38s -> 23480.66s]  Become best friends.
[23492.74s -> 23493.70s]  I've lost control.
[23509.36s -> 23510.72s]  It didn't even work.
[23511.28s -> 23514.01s]  He's like.
[23516.71s -> 23520.15s]  He is burnt to a fucking crisp.
[23542.10s -> 23544.50s]  Pause the game and everybody queue up to get hit by a car.
[23547.46s -> 23549.54s]  Oh, that's so funny.
[23551.60s -> 23553.92s]  Death is trying to put him out with the fire extinguisher.
[23554.48s -> 23555.52s]  No, this guy gets to live.
[23558.02s -> 23558.52s]  Fuck.
[23558.92s -> 23561.56s]  The car is just too good.
[23561.56s -> 23562.92s]  It really is the best thing ever.
[23580.70s -> 23581.90s]  Oh shit, save the game.
[23583.18s -> 23584.57s]  It's all right.
[23584.57s -> 23585.69s]  We still got the gnome.
[23585.69s -> 23587.37s]  We still have drug gnome.
[23587.37s -> 23588.50s]  Save game, save.
[23588.50s -> 23590.82s]  All right, I'll save game, save, save, wait, wait, save, save, save.
[23590.82s -> 23604.28s]  I don't think I even picked that lady to get hit by a car.
[23605.67s -> 23611.70s]  I'm fairly certain that that lady was not one that was selected.
[23611.70s -> 23612.66s]  I can't save the game.
[23620.18s -> 23621.54s]  I can't save the game.
[23622.94s -> 23623.44s]  Why?
[23625.91s -> 23627.83s]  I have, we're stuck here, guys.
[23627.83s -> 23629.03s]  I can't save it.
[23634.92s -> 23635.42s]  What?
[23635.72s -> 23637.08s]  What are you doing?
[23637.08s -> 23638.04s]  Why is it focusing on you?
[23640.97s -> 23642.25s]  Witness death, witness death.
[23643.05s -> 23649.96s]  Half the people are just locked up.
[23649.96s -> 23653.37s]  Why does this guy have a cake?
[23654.25s -> 23655.45s]  What are you bringing this for?
[23655.45s -> 23656.89s]  You're bringing a little mouse loaf.
[23658.65s -> 23660.10s]  The door is locked.
[23660.10s -> 23661.06s]  The cops can't get in.
[23662.42s -> 23672.38s]  All right, it's time for all hell to break, Liz.
[23673.02s -> 23682.65s]  Where is it?
[23683.19s -> 23688.06s]  Good luck.
[23688.06s -> 23688.86s]  Have fun, everybody.
[23688.86s -> 23696.04s]  I can't save it.
[23696.04s -> 23697.56s]  That was a million T-poses.
[23698.28s -> 23700.95s]  Who's even left alive?
[23700.95s -> 23701.51s]  Banana?
[23701.51s -> 23703.11s]  Who's gonna be left alive after all this?
[23720.76s -> 23722.73s]  All right, I can't, I don't even have to.
[23734.63s -> 23735.43s]  Oh, no.
[23735.43s -> 23736.71s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[23739.18s -> 23743.34s]  Like, this is, I have to, like, where's the, where,
[23745.67s -> 23747.11s]  I have to move somebody, I have to move.
[23748.57s -> 23749.45s]  Not the banana.
[23750.01s -> 23751.05s]  I gotta stop him.
[23769.58s -> 23770.22s]  God damn it.
[23775.03s -> 23775.43s]  Saved.
[23776.63s -> 23779.96s]  Okay, I can't do that.
[23779.96s -> 23780.76s]  No, now he's dead.
[23780.76s -> 23781.72s]  Now he's dead, now he's dead.
[23785.69s -> 23786.89s]  Undress him in puke.
[23790.78s -> 23798.70s]  Okay, so let's just get the door open again.
[23800.68s -> 23801.72s]  Unlock the door.
[23801.72s -> 23803.24s]  Invite the rest of the guests in.
[23804.90s -> 23805.62s]  Welcome everybody.
[23805.62s -> 23810.28s]  Okay, I still cannot save the game.
[23810.28s -> 23812.44s]  I want this guy, not only as a best friend,
[23812.44s -> 23813.48s]  I want him around forever.
[23814.12s -> 23815.26s]  I want to meet you.
[23816.87s -> 23818.07s]  Spare the banana.
[23818.07s -> 23819.51s]  Oh, shit, plead.
[23819.51s -> 23820.95s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[23820.95s -> 23821.67s]  I can't plead.
[23822.47s -> 23825.37s]  He's dead.
[23826.42s -> 23827.54s]  This guy's way more important.
[23834.17s -> 23835.29s]  Nobody knows what to do.
[23835.29s -> 23837.05s]  The whole game's just, like, soft-locked.
[23840.20s -> 23857.40s]  It's, the whole game is soft-locked.
[23857.40s -> 23858.28s]  No, plead.

[23878.28s -> 23878.68s]  I don't even know.
[23878.68s -> 23890.25s]  I, it has to be done.

[23967.30s -> 23967.86s]  Okay, there we go.
[23967.86s -> 23968.42s]  Plead for Lily.
[23968.42s -> 23971.83s]  Who cares?
[23971.83s -> 23972.71s]  Just getting a coffee.

[23974.95s -> 23975.27s]  All right.
[23976.31s -> 23978.06s]  There's too many people that are dead.
[23981.90s -> 23982.46s]  All right, come on.
[23983.90s -> 23986.70s]  Plead for Benedict.

[24015.14s -> 24015.70s]  Thank God.
[24016.26s -> 24018.74s]  All right, now I gotta plead for Peter Plumb's life.
[24027.90s -> 24028.62s]  Don't fight.

[24136.63s -> 24139.74s]  I'm throwing you back to hell.
[24140.78s -> 24141.58s]  It's actually working.
[24142.89s -> 24143.77s]  Wait, he's like...
[24149.21s -> 24150.97s]  That scared him, of all things.

[24157.42s -> 24162.14s]  No, she's not.
[24167.45s -> 24168.09s]  Is she pregnant?
[24168.65s -> 24169.13s]  Are you sure?
[24169.77s -> 24170.41s]  How can you tell?
[24178.66s -> 24179.78s]  Oh shit.
[24179.78s -> 24181.22s]  She actually might be pregnant.
[24182.18s -> 24182.58s]  Okay.
[24183.14s -> 24184.02s]  All right, here we go.

[24206.10s -> 24206.90s]  Release spirit.
[24208.92s -> 24209.96s]  How do I just delete them?
[24212.97s -> 24213.29s]  Release.
[24216.63s -> 24219.03s]  You're drinking a lot of coffee while you're pregnant.
[24219.03s -> 24219.83s]  That's not a good idea.
[24227.53s -> 24228.25s]  Booty.
[24231.58s -> 24232.46s]  Invite her to move in.
[24236.28s -> 24237.56s]  She already is, isn't she?
[24238.12s -> 24239.24s]  There's the apartment key.
[24241.21s -> 24242.09s]  Invite to...

[24266.47s -> 24270.04s]  Invite to add to group.
[24274.23s -> 24275.51s]  More choices, maybe?
[24275.51s -> 24276.63s]  Clubs, more choices.
[24278.94s -> 24281.43s]  I have to marry her.
[24283.40s -> 24284.36s]  Well, I can't...
[24284.36s -> 24285.24s]  Can I do that?
[24286.28s -> 24287.16s]  As the banana?
[24287.80s -> 24295.82s]  All right, friendly.
[24298.17s -> 24300.41s]  Ask about giving when we discuss interests.
[24300.41s -> 24301.37s]  Complain about weather.
[24302.25s -> 24303.90s]  Get to know.
[24304.78s -> 24306.06s]  Propose crazy scheme.
[24311.14s -> 24316.62s]  Turn on sheets and then shift click.
[24316.62s -> 24317.50s]  Add to household.
[24323.83s -> 24324.95s]  Add to family.

[24328.76s -> 24330.91s]  Bingo.
[24333.26s -> 24340.15s]  Okay, so pregnant, huh?
[24340.71s -> 24343.32s]  I need to get some sleep.
[24346.63s -> 24348.23s]  Now that I have less people to deal with.
[24349.37s -> 24350.25s]  Clean up the blood.
[24353.85s -> 24354.89s]  Mop up this bullshit.
[24355.69s -> 24356.73s]  Get rid of the urns.
[24364.06s -> 24365.10s]  So many people died.
[24371.90s -> 24372.70s]  Adopt the rat.
[24372.70s -> 24373.58s]  I wonder if it's possible.
[24373.58s -> 24373.98s]  Let's see.
[24375.03s -> 24375.67s]  How would I do that?
[24375.67s -> 24376.23s]  Through the phone?
[24381.03s -> 24382.07s]  Go to the vet?
[24382.07s -> 24385.90s]  The computer, okay.
[24385.90s -> 24387.10s]  Well, I deleted all the computers
[24387.10s -> 24388.54s]  because they were too addicted to the computers.
[24392.04s -> 24392.76s]  Remember?
[24392.76s -> 24396.41s]  I had to get rid of all of them.
[24396.41s -> 24401.03s]  There's no computer left in the house.
[24406.34s -> 24406.98s]  All right, computer.
[24412.74s -> 24413.62s]  What a nice one.
[24414.18s -> 24416.25s]  They're all locked.
[24416.81s -> 24418.20s]  All right, how about this one?
[24418.20s -> 24419.08s]  All in one PC.
[24419.72s -> 24424.89s]  Somebody's bedroom or something.
[24427.85s -> 24428.97s]  I can't put it in the bathtub.
[24428.97s -> 24429.37s]  Never mind.
[24430.09s -> 24431.75s]  Where was this?
[24433.42s -> 24434.14s]  Get a job?
[24434.78s -> 24436.73s]  Well, let's just put it right here for now.
[24436.73s -> 24437.13s]  Who cares?
[24437.69s -> 24443.18s]  Okay, let's go see if I can get...
[24447.42s -> 24448.38s]  Okay, write jokes.
[24448.38s -> 24449.02s]  More choices.
[24449.90s -> 24450.86s]  Career.
[24450.86s -> 24451.50s]  Household.
[24452.76s -> 24453.24s]  Adopt.
[24453.96s -> 24455.48s]  Adopt a dog.
[24455.48s -> 24456.44s]  Was it a dog?
[24456.44s -> 24457.24s]  Adopt.
[24457.24s -> 24457.96s]  Adopt a dog?
[24464.81s -> 24466.17s]  I still can't save the game.
[24466.73s -> 24469.72s]  Oh, it's because the adoption's in progress.
[24469.72s -> 24470.20s]  That's fine.
[24480.31s -> 24482.41s]  It's not there.
[24482.97s -> 24486.86s]  Sorry, guys.
[24487.42s -> 24490.68s]  What about a cat?
[24500.46s -> 24501.66s]  I have to adopt the cat.
[24503.56s -> 24503.80s]  No.
[24506.25s -> 24506.49s]  No.
[24507.53s -> 24510.87s]  I'll try the other one to see.
[24520.25s -> 24520.97s]  What the hell?
[24526.78s -> 24527.10s]  Nope.
[24531.67s -> 24532.95s]  You can buy those.
[24533.59s -> 24534.55s]  You can adopt kids.
[24536.30s -> 24539.82s]  All right, get rid of these so we can hurry this up.
[24539.82s -> 24540.94s]  Spirit world, release.
[24543.42s -> 24544.22s]  This one, please.
[24544.94s -> 24549.94s]  Come on, then we can feed...
[24549.94s -> 24550.98s]  I just gotta free us.
[24550.98s -> 24551.86s]  Free the spirit.
[24552.42s -> 24555.58s]  Goodbye.
[24567.26s -> 24567.50s]  No!
[24590.34s -> 24592.34s]  Oh, autonomous killing was on.
[24593.61s -> 24593.93s]  Still...
[24594.57s -> 24596.12s]  It's all right, I'll plead for his life.
[24601.34s -> 24601.82s]  Plead.
[24601.82s -> 24602.22s]  Plead.
[24603.50s -> 24604.46s]  Plead for Andy.
[24606.18s -> 24607.14s]  Plead for Andy.
[24607.14s -> 24607.78s]  Stop crying.
[24607.78s -> 24608.26s]  Get over there.
[24629.88s -> 24630.28s]  Demand.
[24632.76s -> 24635.99s]  Let him live.
[24641.06s -> 24641.30s]  No.
[24658.52s -> 24661.50s]  Well, now it's just these two that live in the house together.
[24661.50s -> 24679.00s]  God damn it.
[24679.00s -> 24681.88s]  Turn off auto kill.
[24681.88s -> 24685.72s]  He wanted to get rid of everybody else.
[24685.72s -> 24691.51s]  Where is it?
[24691.51s -> 24693.99s]  War choices, extreme violence, options.
[24694.71s -> 24696.90s]  Turn it off.
[24696.90s -> 24697.62s]  Disable.
[24700.17s -> 24701.45s]  Disable for everybody.
[24702.01s -> 24703.85s]  For everyone, not just this person.
[24703.85s -> 24706.82s]  That's okay.
[24712.26s -> 24714.02s]  Uh, for the whole household, right?
[24714.58s -> 24716.74s]  Why would I open...
[24716.74s -> 24717.30s]  What?
[24727.35s -> 24728.07s]  Is it disabled?
[24744.90s -> 24746.74s]  I figured it would be down next to the one that says enable.
[24748.90s -> 24749.22s]  All right.
[24757.58s -> 24758.94s]  So when does the baby come out?
[24769.43s -> 24770.15s]  Nine months?
[24770.15s -> 24772.07s]  It's a full nine months?
[24772.07s -> 24776.25s]  Is it gonna take that long?
[24776.25s -> 24781.58s]  It's real time?
[24781.58s -> 24788.86s]  Is it nine in-game months?
[24788.86s -> 24794.20s]  How long does a genie baby work?
[24794.84s -> 24797.08s]  I can't tell if that's smell or if that's genie lines.
[24802.74s -> 24803.22s]  All right.
[24803.22s -> 24804.58s]  Can clean up the house.
[24805.53s -> 24806.17s]  Open the door.
[24806.17s -> 24808.20s]  Unlock the door.
[24808.20s -> 24808.52s]  Right?
[24808.52s -> 24809.72s]  No, it's already open.
[24809.72s -> 24810.12s]  All right.
[24810.12s -> 24810.84s]  This guy's dead.
[24815.50s -> 24815.98s]  All right.
[24818.30s -> 24819.50s]  Clean up the house.
[24822.01s -> 24823.45s]  Clean, clean, clean.
[24823.45s -> 24823.77s]  God.
[24827.48s -> 24829.40s]  Let's check back on the save in nine months.
[24830.04s -> 24834.14s]  By the way, why would I not see the gnome?
[24837.83s -> 24840.12s]  I'm kind of concerned here.
[24840.12s -> 24840.60s]  Hold on.
[24853.11s -> 24854.07s]  Thank God he's okay.
[24854.07s -> 24854.71s]  All right.
[24854.71s -> 24868.78s]  How do I turn this off?
[24869.66s -> 24873.10s]  Why are there like five murder brides walking around town right now?
[24881.94s -> 24882.10s]  All right.
[24882.10s -> 24891.02s]  I'm gonna get a job.
[24891.02s -> 24891.74s]  Goodbye.
[24891.74s -> 24892.30s]  Release.
[24892.30s -> 24892.70s]  Release.
[24894.47s -> 24895.43s]  Release.
[24895.43s -> 24896.55s]  All of them.
[24896.55s -> 24902.02s]  Why can't I get rid of this?
[24902.58s -> 24903.64s]  Just take it.
[24903.64s -> 24904.04s]  Who cares?
[24908.79s -> 24909.27s]  All right.
[24909.27s -> 24912.47s]  Still, I did this many people died in here.
[24912.47s -> 24915.96s]  I don't remember this many people dying.
[24915.96s -> 24917.62s]  It's like 12 people.
[24918.26s -> 24935.72s]  Get them all out of here.
[24935.72s -> 24935.96s]  Good.
[24936.52s -> 24938.92s]  Clean up.
[24938.92s -> 24944.78s]  Clean up.
[24944.78s -> 24947.27s]  Don't release Peter Plum.
[24947.27s -> 24948.07s]  Why?
[24948.07s -> 24951.43s]  He'll be back.
[24952.95s -> 24960.44s]  He's gonna come out of here.
[24960.44s -> 24962.28s]  He deserves better.
[24962.28s -> 24965.18s]  All right.
[24965.18s -> 24965.66s]  How you doing?
[24965.66s -> 24968.44s]  Energy, hygiene, take a bath.
[24968.44s -> 24969.48s]  Take a bubble bath.
[24969.48s -> 24970.52s]  I think you deserve it.
[24970.52s -> 24974.04s]  How are you doing?
[24977.14s -> 24979.54s]  Almost ready to wake up.
[24979.54s -> 24980.26s]  Grab some food.
[24982.62s -> 24983.26s]  See what I'm saying?
[24983.26s -> 24985.02s]  I can't like play the Sims.
[24985.02s -> 24986.71s]  All right.
[24986.71s -> 24988.39s]  Let's get up and get some food.
[24988.39s -> 24989.11s]  Take a bath.
[24990.76s -> 24991.16s]  Okay.
[24993.19s -> 24994.95s]  People just were on fire burning.
[24995.51s -> 24997.03s]  Zombies were eating people.
[24997.03s -> 25001.42s]  What happens if the genie rubs the lamp?
[25001.42s -> 25015.61s]  That's kind of an interesting question.
[25015.61s -> 25016.17s]  All right.
[25016.17s -> 25016.57s]  Wake up.
[25017.13s -> 25023.03s]  That's enough sleep.
[25023.03s -> 25023.98s]  Get some food.
[25026.94s -> 25028.30s]  Grab some food from here.
[25029.38s -> 25030.34s]  Hire a caterer.
[25030.90s -> 25032.26s]  Just fucking have somebody fucking eat.
[25033.14s -> 25034.10s]  I don't want to make any food.
[25043.72s -> 25044.52s]  Sleep.
[25045.72s -> 25047.72s]  That's not the reaction you want somebody to have.
[25051.66s -> 25053.34s]  Get your breakfast catered.
[25057.02s -> 25058.54s]  What a piece of crap.
[25073.58s -> 25075.42s]  Didn't the entire Pizzaz family die?
[25076.06s -> 25089.14s]  All right.
[25089.14s -> 25090.26s]  Clean it all up.
[25090.26s -> 25092.12s]  Oh, I evicted them.
[25093.72s -> 25095.91s]  Well, take a look.
[25095.91s -> 25098.07s]  Now the doll comes full circle.
[25098.79s -> 25102.34s]  How are you doing?
[25102.34s -> 25102.66s]  Hungry?
[25104.82s -> 25105.06s]  Okay.
[25105.06s -> 25106.82s]  I gave you a hundred bucks to come here.
[25106.82s -> 25108.10s]  It wasn't a hundred dollars to join the family.
[25108.10s -> 25109.70s]  That was a hundred dollars to cater of food.
[25110.81s -> 25111.93s]  Cook a gourmet meal.
[25112.57s -> 25131.46s]  Now, wait, what?
[25131.46s -> 25132.02s]  What's going on?
[25132.74s -> 25133.54s]  What happened to my camera?
[25134.66s -> 25134.90s]  Alt?
[25136.18s -> 25136.82s]  Alt tab?
[25136.82s -> 25137.30s]  Alt?
[25137.30s -> 25137.94s]  What did I just do?
[25145.06s -> 25145.30s]  Huh?
[25145.86s -> 25151.48s]  Oh, shit.
[25151.48s -> 25151.80s]  Okay.
[25153.08s -> 25159.80s]  What is she making?
[25160.36s -> 25162.89s]  Didn't I, I ordered, I wanted breakfast.
[25163.77s -> 25168.20s]  What, is it vinegar?
[25168.92s -> 25170.28s]  What are you putting that in there for?
[25186.17s -> 25187.45s]  Is it hydrogen peroxide?
[25187.45s -> 25187.77s]  Really?
[25194.63s -> 25194.95s]  What?
[25198.86s -> 25200.14s]  A cake for breakfast.
[25200.86s -> 25212.23s]  All right.
[25212.23s -> 25214.15s]  Add like a, add a wetting topper.
[25217.40s -> 25221.27s]  No, how do I eat it?
[25222.07s -> 25231.45s]  Take a piece.
[25232.09s -> 25236.28s]  A cake for breakfast.
[25237.40s -> 25239.40s]  This is like a 12-year-old's house.
[25240.12s -> 25245.99s]  Do I not have a trash barrel?
[25245.99s -> 25247.03s]  It's right here.
[25247.03s -> 25247.43s]  Use it.
[25248.23s -> 25248.71s]  Dishes?
[25248.71s -> 25249.43s]  What's going on?
[25253.13s -> 25255.77s]  Is there a way for me to see how pregnant I am?
[25268.62s -> 25269.42s]  Very pregnant.
[25272.28s -> 25273.48s]  How do I know how pregnant?
[25292.81s -> 25293.85s]  Doesn't have a job.
[25293.85s -> 25294.81s]  Well, you're pregnant.
[25297.78s -> 25298.50s]  You just hang out.
[25300.97s -> 25304.66s]  I'm still sleeping.
[25304.66s -> 25311.37s]  Hover mouse over the pacifier for the trimester.
[25315.40s -> 25317.88s]  Second trimester in seven hours.
[25321.00s -> 25321.72s]  Oh, shit.
[25323.00s -> 25324.36s]  Second trimester coming up.
[25325.56s -> 25325.96s]  Let's see.
[25326.76s -> 25376.17s]  Oh, man.
[25380.89s -> 25382.01s]  Oh, what?
[25382.57s -> 25391.18s]  Hover over the thing.
[25391.18s -> 25395.11s]  No, it's okay.
[25395.11s -> 25395.43s]  We're good.
[25404.41s -> 25405.29s]  Guess.
[25405.29s -> 25406.92s]  I guess everything's fine.
[25407.91s -> 25413.19s]  That was a pretty wild debate right there.
[25413.19s -> 25419.32s]  It took it off and she was crying and it went to the bathroom.
[25419.32s -> 25421.24s]  Oh, that was not...
[25421.24s -> 25423.08s]  There's too many emotions going on right now.
[25423.08s -> 25450.68s]  From mourning...
[25450.68s -> 25453.00s]  From losing a good friend.
[25455.91s -> 25464.33s]  We took that way too seriously.
[25464.33s -> 25465.45s]  Oh, man.
[25465.45s -> 25466.01s]  That just...
[25468.62s -> 25469.26s]  Baby?
[25469.26s -> 25477.38s]  No, we're in a good mood.
[25477.38s -> 25478.90s]  Second trimester coming up.
[25478.90s -> 25483.38s]  This is a dirty ass toilet.
[25483.38s -> 25486.23s]  What are you doing?
[25486.23s -> 25486.79s]  Just sleeping?
[25493.56s -> 25495.93s]  Flush the toilet.
[25495.93s -> 25496.57s]  No, it's clean.
[25500.46s -> 25504.74s]  It's kind of concerning how long he's been asleep.
[25505.78s -> 25506.98s]  Uh, yeah.
[25506.98s -> 25508.74s]  It's been like three days.
[25514.33s -> 25517.13s]  He's been asleep for like 31 hours.
[25524.55s -> 25526.15s]  This game is fucked.
[25526.15s -> 25536.94s]  What is that, baby?
[25536.94s -> 25537.98s]  Second trimester.
[25537.98s -> 25539.10s]  How many trimesters are there?
[25543.82s -> 25544.14s]  Four?
[25549.83s -> 25558.42s]  How many periods are in a basketball game?
[25558.42s -> 25558.82s]  Three.
[25558.82s -> 25560.90s]  All right, let's get back to normal here.
[25562.55s -> 25563.03s]  Flirty.
[25566.39s -> 25567.67s]  Say trimester again.
[25567.67s -> 25568.39s]  Trimester.
[25571.02s -> 25572.46s]  Three-mester.
[25572.46s -> 25573.82s]  Oh, so dork.
[25575.74s -> 25576.62s]  Shoo-bee-row.
[25579.48s -> 25589.38s]  Okay.
[25589.94s -> 25595.02s]  So I wonder how long the third trimester is in the game.
[25595.02s -> 25595.90s]  I've never seen it before.
[25597.18s -> 25598.90s]  Floopy.
[25600.50s -> 25602.65s]  All right, get...
[25604.81s -> 25607.45s]  All right, quit lucid dreaming and wake the fuck up.
[25608.68s -> 25614.95s]  Up, up, up, up, get...
[25615.59s -> 25619.46s]  You're a lost cause.
[25626.33s -> 25627.61s]  Unpleasant conversation.
[25634.44s -> 25635.40s]  Tell gross joke.
[25635.40s -> 25636.20s]  Apologize.
[25636.20s -> 25636.76s]  Go away.
[25639.18s -> 25639.74s]  Mischief.
[25640.38s -> 25642.02s]  Give fake news.
[25642.02s -> 25643.78s]  Invite to fake party.
[25643.78s -> 25644.90s]  Lie about career.
[25650.12s -> 25650.92s]  Do an impression.
[25661.50s -> 25670.07s]  Get arrested for doing drugs?
[25675.32s -> 25676.12s]  Uh, hold on.
[25694.44s -> 25696.41s]  How fat can you make them?
[25699.77s -> 25706.60s]  You all right?
[25706.60s -> 25715.53s]  Why is everybody having...
[25715.53s -> 25716.57s]  Why is everybody panicking?
[25718.28s -> 25719.48s]  I'm at my limit.
[25721.83s -> 25722.95s]  Remembering a sim.
[25725.67s -> 25726.15s]  Two hours.
[25727.45s -> 25728.09s]  So close.
[25728.97s -> 25736.46s]  Is it laughing?
[25740.18s -> 25741.46s]  Everybody's just crying.
[25742.02s -> 25755.48s]  I can't even interact.
[25757.14s -> 25757.62s]  Get up.
[25762.50s -> 25767.51s]  All right, let's have a...
[25767.51s -> 25768.71s]  Let's cheer up.
[25768.71s -> 25772.94s]  Try to cheer up.
[25772.94s -> 25776.81s]  What's wrong?
[25777.75s -> 25778.79s]  What just happened?
[25779.35s -> 25781.59s]  Something unusual just happened to Penny out of nowhere
[25781.59s -> 25783.83s]  and so leave her scared for a couple of hours.
[25784.47s -> 25801.99s]  All right, let's go.
[25803.19s -> 25804.74s]  What are some drugs?
[25805.38s -> 25806.49s]  Just marijuana.
[25807.13s -> 25807.85s]  Isn't that a big deal?
[25808.41s -> 25820.90s]  Her game crashed and she cried about it.
[25821.62s -> 25825.96s]  Where are you running to?
[25829.59s -> 25829.99s]  Okay.
[25831.03s -> 25834.10s]  Third trimester in one day.
[25834.98s -> 25836.74s]  Last trimester.
[25836.74s -> 25840.42s]  Let's just...
[25840.42s -> 25840.90s]  Let's go.
[25841.62s -> 25842.50s]  How are they doing?
[25842.50s -> 25842.82s]  Food?
[25843.38s -> 25844.34s]  They're all right.
[25844.34s -> 25845.54s]  How you doing on food?
[25845.54s -> 25846.36s]  You're doing fine.
[25851.86s -> 25854.02s]  This dawn of this last day.
[25858.60s -> 25859.56s]  Pregnancy speedrun.
[25861.46s -> 25862.10s]  It's getting late.
[25862.82s -> 25868.30s]  It's almost 2 a.m. Eastern.
[25869.26s -> 25877.67s]  And as much as it is fun dicking around for 22 hours.
[25879.74s -> 25880.46s]  Remove the urn.
[25882.26s -> 25883.86s]  I can't even move it.
[25883.86s -> 25884.50s]  I can't get rid of it.
[25884.50s -> 25885.78s]  Just put it in your inventory.
[25886.42s -> 25899.00s]  Put the urn on as a hat.
[25902.42s -> 25903.38s]  The chaos book?
[25903.38s -> 25904.18s]  No, not yet.
[25904.18s -> 25905.38s]  I need to see this...
[25905.38s -> 25905.94s]  Wear this...
[25905.94s -> 25906.82s]  I need to see the pregnancy.
[25906.82s -> 25907.54s]  I've never seen it before.
[25917.18s -> 25918.70s]  You're in Nevada?
[25918.70s -> 25919.90s]  Yeah, I'm talking about for everybody else.
[25920.46s -> 25922.30s]  It's almost 11 p.m. for me right now.
[25922.30s -> 25925.59s]  But that means that it's almost 2 a.m.
[25925.59s -> 25929.13s]  For a bunch of people that are in America.
[25929.13s -> 25930.81s]  And forget about EU right now.
[25931.53s -> 25937.26s]  All right, getting there.
[25937.26s -> 25937.98s]  18 hours.
[25938.78s -> 25940.63s]  How do you have a baby delivered?
[25945.16s -> 25946.52s]  Throw this thing in the trash, please.
[25951.19s -> 25954.52s]  Do I have to have like a...
[25954.52s -> 25956.36s]  The hospital people at the doctor have to come out?
[25956.36s -> 25957.56s]  Do I have to go to the hospital?
[25958.36s -> 25963.05s]  What are you calling me?
[25963.61s -> 25966.89s]  Let's go down to the karaoke bar and sing some duets.
[25966.89s -> 25968.17s]  I've been practicing like crazy.
[25970.87s -> 25972.23s]  I was trying to say yes.
[25975.74s -> 25976.70s]  Never mind.
[25985.02s -> 25985.90s]  Baby's all I care about.
[25985.90s -> 25986.30s]  Let's go.
[25991.82s -> 25993.58s]  Put microwave on head and make food.
[26002.36s -> 26008.10s]  Am I gonna vaccinate the kid?
[26008.10s -> 26008.90s]  Oh, please.
[26009.86s -> 26010.26s]  All right.
[26016.14s -> 26016.86s]  Are you gonna...
[26017.42s -> 26017.74s]  What?
[26017.74s -> 26021.32s]  What's wrong?
[26021.32s -> 26022.20s]  Morning sickness.
[26024.92s -> 26026.36s]  And sore back.
[26028.90s -> 26030.10s]  You're almost through it.
[26030.10s -> 26031.14s]  It's almost over.
[26038.20s -> 26041.16s]  Anti-vaxxing is not politics.
[26041.16s -> 26043.16s]  No, I'm gonna vaccinate my goddamn baby.
[26043.88s -> 26055.78s]  12 hours.
[26055.78s -> 26056.26s]  Who's here?
[26057.43s -> 26057.99s]  Oh, it's me.
[26058.55s -> 26073.99s]  This cake has lasted a long time.
[26075.43s -> 26085.43s]  What happened to his banana costume?
[26087.14s -> 26087.86s]  My immersion.
[26087.86s -> 26089.06s]  It's now fall.
[26089.06s -> 26089.62s]  Prank day.
[26099.45s -> 26100.73s]  I'm not gonna go prank day.
[26104.25s -> 26105.77s]  End the holiday early.
[26105.77s -> 26106.94s]  Is it the next day?
[26107.50s -> 26115.77s]  Almost.
[26116.41s -> 26122.07s]  Prank day canceled.
[26122.07s -> 26129.05s]  All that matters is getting this baby out and away from this house.
[26136.09s -> 26136.89s]  Worst dream.
[26136.89s -> 26138.65s]  You ended prank day.
[26138.65s -> 26145.43s]  We already did prank day like eight hours ago.
[26145.43s -> 26146.07s]  What's going on?
[26146.71s -> 26148.90s]  Oh, she's puking.
[26149.62s -> 26158.34s]  Back to the computer.
[26158.90s -> 26164.09s]  What else can we do?
[26164.09s -> 26165.21s]  Practice programming.
[26170.02s -> 26170.82s]  How fresh.
[26170.82s -> 26171.62s]  You know what I've noticed?
[26172.34s -> 26176.12s]  Is anybody left?
[26176.12s -> 26178.34s]  I think we're the final...
[26178.90s -> 26181.72s]  There's nobody left.
[26182.28s -> 26187.16s]  The gnome is left.
[26187.16s -> 26187.40s]  Can I...
[26187.40s -> 26187.72s]  How do I...
[26187.72s -> 26188.60s]  I want to...
[26188.60s -> 26190.20s]  I'm just gonna bring the gnome over here.
[26190.76s -> 26194.73s]  Give me a second.
[26194.73s -> 26203.50s]  I'm gonna age the baby up when the baby gets here.
[26203.50s -> 26205.34s]  And let's see if it's just the dad again.
[26205.34s -> 26206.38s]  Let's see if we get Peter back.
[26206.78s -> 26224.30s]  Reincarnation through pregnancy.
[26225.10s -> 26237.38s]  Nothing like a pregnant woman buying illegal drugs.
[26238.10s -> 26241.29s]  How do I get him over here?
[26241.93s -> 26243.13s]  I need to call him, right?
[26247.02s -> 26248.14s]  How do I get you over here?
[26255.14s -> 26256.74s]  Have I explained why there's a ghost in the house?
[26257.54s -> 26258.42s]  Well, it's a genie.
[26259.38s -> 26265.06s]  Genie came out and started to socialize with everybody.
[26265.06s -> 26267.54s]  Granted a couple of real peace wishes.
[26269.70s -> 26272.10s]  That genie then fell in love with somebody in the house.
[26273.61s -> 26275.45s]  And then that person that she fell in love with
[26276.49s -> 26280.01s]  during a sims murder party died.
[26280.01s -> 26283.56s]  I've never met the gnome, so I can't invite him over.
[26289.62s -> 26289.94s]  Really?
[26290.58s -> 26292.79s]  God damn it.
[26297.32s -> 26300.12s]  Oh, then he like punched her in the face.
[26300.12s -> 26301.40s]  So I ran him over with a car.
[26308.22s -> 26308.94s]  All right, let's go.
[26308.94s -> 26309.50s]  Actually, you know what?
[26309.50s -> 26310.62s]  Let's save it here.
[26310.62s -> 26313.58s]  And I'm gonna go to the gnome's house.
[26313.58s -> 26322.68s]  Let's head to the gnome's house.
[26324.17s -> 26325.21s]  They'll be fine for a little while.
[26326.01s -> 26332.22s]  I need to get back to home worlds.
[26332.22s -> 26332.70s]  No, no, no, no.
[26334.01s -> 26334.81s]  Cancel this travel.
[26334.81s -> 26335.53s]  I have to just exit.
[26337.51s -> 26338.15s]  Manage worlds.
[26338.71s -> 26350.30s]  Let's take a look.
[26350.30s -> 26352.78s]  It's been a long time since we've even looked over here
[26352.78s -> 26353.90s]  and saw what was going on here.
[26366.18s -> 26367.64s]  All right.
[26367.64s -> 26369.90s]  So how are we doing?
[26371.03s -> 26371.67s]  Intro for it.
[26371.67s -> 26373.03s]  I don't think the gnome has left his house.
[26377.42s -> 26378.54s]  Uncomfortable.
[26378.54s -> 26385.19s]  I need you to go visit.
[26385.83s -> 26387.62s]  I want you to go visit somebody.
[26390.78s -> 26391.98s]  Nobody else knows who I am.
[26396.63s -> 26397.51s]  Stuck in the suit.
[26397.51s -> 26398.79s]  Yeah, he doesn't come out.
[26398.79s -> 26403.99s]  Is there a way I can just go visit the carrot?
[26403.99s -> 26404.39s]  Wait a minute.
[26405.03s -> 26407.69s]  What are they picketing out here?
[26407.69s -> 26413.21s]  What's going on here?
[26429.58s -> 26430.14s]  What does it say?
[26438.12s -> 26438.68s]  What does it say?
[26439.96s -> 26446.89s]  What is it?
[26449.00s -> 26449.48s]  I don't know.
[26449.48s -> 26451.98s]  Is it about the police?
[26453.74s -> 26455.51s]  About scales?
[26456.63s -> 26457.59s]  That just heard Russia.
[26465.19s -> 26465.75s]  Me too.
[26466.39s -> 26467.03s]  Me too.
[26468.39s -> 26470.07s]  I also believe this.
[26470.07s -> 26470.87s]  Whatever it is.
[26472.12s -> 26473.48s]  I believe that too.
[26484.92s -> 26485.48s]  I did.
[26485.48s -> 26486.44s]  He did it on his own.
[26491.64s -> 26493.32s]  You acquired the charisma skill.
[26493.96s -> 26497.94s]  Hey, that was fun.
[26501.74s -> 26508.86s]  So what do you guys do after?
[26508.86s -> 26509.42s]  What do you want to do?
[26524.06s -> 26532.22s]  You all right?
[26542.46s -> 26547.40s]  This guy's freaking me out.
[26562.30s -> 26564.14s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[26564.14s -> 26565.26s]  No violence.
[26565.26s -> 26569.85s]  Let's go.
[26569.85s -> 26571.77s]  Why am I just the person that's doing?
[26571.77s -> 26573.05s]  This really is the gnome.
[26573.05s -> 26576.68s]  This just is like Twitch chat, right?
[26577.96s -> 26580.65s]  I'm gonna, I'm gonna get out of this.
[26582.26s -> 26583.54s]  You took the trash out now.
[26583.54s -> 26584.90s]  I took the trash out now too.
[26590.71s -> 26601.11s]  Jeremy, you're gonna miss the birth?
[26601.67s -> 26602.15s]  No, I'm not.
[26602.15s -> 26602.95s]  We got plenty of time.
[26603.59s -> 26607.08s]  This bloody stinks.
[26608.78s -> 26609.74s]  Why would you do that?
[26609.74s -> 26611.10s]  I better not do that too.
[26616.90s -> 26621.18s]  I don't know what to do.
[26624.50s -> 26625.14s]  All right.
[26625.14s -> 26626.02s]  I'm glad he was fucked.
[26626.66s -> 26645.62s]  I hear police.
[26649.70s -> 26649.94s]  Hey.
[26651.54s -> 26652.98s]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[26652.98s -> 26654.34s]  I got something to ask you, lady.
[26655.86s -> 26659.45s]  Come here, come here, come here, come here, come here.
[26659.45s -> 26661.13s]  Hey, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[26661.13s -> 26661.69s]  Wait, please.
[26663.72s -> 26664.76s]  Forget about this guy.
[26664.76s -> 26666.12s]  Who cares about this guy?
[26666.12s -> 26666.36s]  Go.
[26667.16s -> 26670.47s]  Don't let her get away before talking and making a new friend.
[26671.99s -> 26677.54s]  Hey, come on.
[26677.54s -> 26678.50s]  No, don't let her go.
[26680.44s -> 26693.00s]  Uh, just go here then.
[26693.00s -> 26693.72s]  What are you doing?
[26694.52s -> 26706.38s]  Here's an opportunity.
[26706.38s -> 26707.02s]  Just get over here.
[26747.18s -> 26747.82s]  Call.
[26747.82s -> 26752.70s]  Call over.
[26752.70s -> 26753.66s]  Call over.
[26753.66s -> 26755.54s]  Why is this taking so long?
[26756.79s -> 26762.68s]  You're running by her.
[26762.68s -> 26763.08s]  All right.
[26763.08s -> 26764.76s]  You guys have to understand.
[26764.76s -> 26766.41s]  Look at the lower left.
[26766.41s -> 26783.34s]  I didn't do shit.
[26783.34s -> 26783.82s]  Finally.
[26785.02s -> 26785.82s]  My God.
[26804.58s -> 26806.50s]  Did she just hold back a pew?
[26813.05s -> 26813.93s]  At least I met her.
[26814.73s -> 26815.29s]  I met her.
[26818.02s -> 26819.54s]  Oh, she's gonna, is she gonna get birth?
[26822.76s -> 26823.24s]  Where are you going?
[26823.24s -> 26823.72s]  Where are you going?
[26823.72s -> 26827.21s]  Where are you going?
[26827.21s -> 26828.41s]  Oh, my TV is too big.
[26828.41s -> 26829.85s]  I gotta go check on it.
[26829.85s -> 26831.05s]  Am I gonna go chat with her?
[26831.05s -> 26831.29s]  All right.
[26831.29s -> 26832.41s]  I gotta get out of here.
[26832.41s -> 26832.73s]  Save.
[26836.17s -> 26836.89s]  Manage worlds.
[26843.13s -> 26847.69s]  She's gonna go watch the birth on his computer.
[26847.69s -> 26848.57s]  I gotta get back there.
[26848.57s -> 26849.53s]  I gotta get back and chat.
[26850.09s -> 26868.78s]  Yeah, he's going to watch the stream.
[26868.78s -> 26869.26s]  Here we go.
[26875.22s -> 26876.18s]  Give birth in.
[26878.07s -> 26878.55s]  Okay.
[26879.27s -> 26881.54s]  There's a moment everybody was waiting for.
[26881.54s -> 26884.41s]  The sim is nearly full term.
[26884.41s -> 26886.73s]  More than ready to have this kid and be done with it already.
[26886.73s -> 26888.49s]  Give birth very, very soon.
[26889.05s -> 26889.93s]  Invite the gnome over.
[26889.93s -> 26890.57s]  That's a good idea.
[26906.30s -> 26907.34s]  The gnome is watching the stream.
[26907.34s -> 26907.90s]  It's okay.
[26907.90s -> 26908.86s]  They can pause it.
[26908.86s -> 26911.06s]  They can see it in real life.
[26911.06s -> 26912.34s]  I'm Gnata Gnoblin.
[26912.34s -> 26912.98s]  I'll be right.
[26912.98s -> 26914.66s]  I forgot that's what the name of the character was.
[26920.95s -> 26921.91s]  Oh, boy.
[26921.91s -> 26922.79s]  Do I need a doctor?
[26923.35s -> 26928.04s]  There he is.
[26930.63s -> 26931.59s]  What's the meal you're gonna have?
[26933.88s -> 26934.28s]  Uh-oh.
[26934.84s -> 26939.82s]  The grilled cheese.
[26959.94s -> 26972.82s]  Car her and end the stream.
[26972.82s -> 26973.54s]  Uh, no.
[26974.42s -> 26975.54s]  Not before we see this baby.
[26976.18s -> 26978.74s]  Let's talk about the current drug market.
[26978.74s -> 26979.22s]  How is it?
[26995.69s -> 26996.81s]  All right.
[26996.81s -> 26997.45s]  Talk about the...
[26998.81s -> 27000.25s]  Discuss the current drug market.

[27007.32s -> 27008.04s]  Grabbing trash.
[27008.04s -> 27010.76s]  Just me and this lady have a big thing this afternoon.
[27016.14s -> 27017.42s]  Why would you buy a fake ID?
[27019.05s -> 27020.33s]  If you were like 30?
[27023.46s -> 27024.50s]  Invite the gnome to move in
[27024.50s -> 27026.26s]  after we buy like a hundred different drugs.
[27034.52s -> 27035.72s]  Let's talk about, uh...
[27045.91s -> 27046.63s]  You can have one of these.
[27047.59s -> 27049.43s]  A fake ID for the baby.
[27066.52s -> 27067.56s]  Are these high-quality drugs?
[27072.90s -> 27074.58s]  The pregnant lady is not gonna have any of these drugs.
[27081.37s -> 27083.37s]  I'm gonadogonoblin is unemployed.
[27086.63s -> 27087.67s]  Let's joke about the...
[27089.11s -> 27089.51s]  Where is she?
[27094.47s -> 27095.83s]  Oh, pardon me, Sam.
[27099.05s -> 27100.17s]  Joke about the cops.
[27103.45s -> 27104.25s]  Okay, what about, uh...
[27107.13s -> 27108.41s]  What else you got?
[27108.41s -> 27108.89s]  Drugs.
[27109.85s -> 27111.05s]  Drug dealing.
[27111.05s -> 27118.39s]  Inquire about selling amphetamine.
[27118.39s -> 27118.71s]  Really?
[27127.27s -> 27127.83s]  Where is she?
[27128.47s -> 27129.72s]  She's fine.
[27130.36s -> 27131.91s]  She's just drinking like an iced tea.
[27139.61s -> 27144.95s]  So, I'm going to sell drugs for the gnome.
[27146.50s -> 27147.46s]  Give me some.
[27148.60s -> 27149.64s]  Is that what's happening here?
[27150.36s -> 27155.62s]  That's not, that's not alcoholic.
[27161.34s -> 27161.82s]  Nightclub.
[27163.70s -> 27164.66s]  Don't do this to me.
[27164.66s -> 27166.10s]  Not right before the baby comes.
[27175.91s -> 27176.47s]  She's dead.
[27185.88s -> 27186.60s]  All right, let's go.
[27201.75s -> 27202.47s]  All right, so where's...
[27204.86s -> 27205.58s]  She's dead.
[27223.62s -> 27224.74s]  Wait, is she going home?
[27225.46s -> 27230.01s]  She's going home.
[27230.01s -> 27230.73s]  Why are you going home?
[27230.73s -> 27231.13s]  No, no, no.
[27231.13s -> 27232.39s]  Get over here.
[27232.39s -> 27233.03s]  Home?
[27233.03s -> 27235.27s]  No, come dance.
[27245.62s -> 27246.02s]  Lantern?
[27246.02s -> 27246.82s]  What are we gonna eat?
[27252.58s -> 27253.46s]  Let's dance.
[27253.46s -> 27254.50s]  Whoa, what was that noise?
[27254.50s -> 27255.14s]  That was loud.
[27256.02s -> 27256.66s]  What was that?
[27263.67s -> 27264.07s]  Ow.
[27273.75s -> 27275.11s]  Pauline Parrot.
[27275.11s -> 27276.15s]  R.I.P.
[27276.15s -> 27276.95s]  She's dead.
[27289.10s -> 27289.90s]  I don't understand.
[27294.42s -> 27295.94s]  Okay, uh, how do I...
[27299.45s -> 27302.12s]  Let's just remind her.
[27306.41s -> 27307.05s]  Dance battle.
[27307.85s -> 27310.01s]  Okay, that's fucking actually hurting my ears.
[27315.29s -> 27315.93s]  Seriously.
[27318.04s -> 27320.04s]  That lady just did the coke off the ground, I think.
[27345.96s -> 27347.96s]  That was not a dance battle.
[27359.83s -> 27360.47s]  Dance battle.
[27360.47s -> 27361.11s]  Dance battle.
[27361.11s -> 27362.15s]  Dance battle.
[27362.15s -> 27367.85s]  Oh, she loves this.
[27367.85s -> 27368.35s]  She...
[27369.29s -> 27369.79s]  What?
[27374.12s -> 27375.08s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[27377.18s -> 27377.90s]  Wait, wait.
[27379.74s -> 27387.42s]  I didn't do it.
[27388.38s -> 27389.66s]  I didn't do that.
[27390.46s -> 27390.96s]  Uh...
[27392.71s -> 27394.23s]  I didn't do that.
[27394.23s -> 27394.73s]  Uh...
[27400.23s -> 27400.71s]  What?
[27400.71s -> 27401.67s]  What am I supposed...
[27401.67s -> 27402.95s]  I just wanted them to all...
[27402.95s -> 27403.35s]  She's...
[27403.35s -> 27403.85s]  Look at...
[27404.79s -> 27405.67s]  She's evil.
[27406.55s -> 27407.35s]  She's evil.
[27408.15s -> 27410.07s]  She likes being at music.
[27410.07s -> 27410.57s]  It's...
[27410.57s -> 27411.19s]  It's helpful.
[27412.47s -> 27426.60s]  All right, stop.
[27429.54s -> 27430.18s]  What?
[27430.18s -> 27436.39s]  Benedict just wants to stop.
[27438.07s -> 27439.99s]  He feels like throwing up, but though...
[27440.63s -> 27442.79s]  Through one of the pinpricks of altered realities,
[27442.79s -> 27445.19s]  he sees words wrapping around his vision saying,
[27445.19s -> 27447.19s]  if you throw up while on streams, you're gonna die.
[27448.15s -> 27448.65s]  What?
[27449.19s -> 27460.65s]  All right, get out of here.
[27460.65s -> 27461.85s]  You have to get out of here right now.
[27462.90s -> 27463.40s]  Out.
[27465.77s -> 27466.97s]  The Sim cannot go home.
[27467.77s -> 27468.27s]  Why?
[27472.76s -> 27474.28s]  She wasn't trying to leave before, guys.
[27474.28s -> 27474.76s]  She definitely...
[27474.76s -> 27475.80s]  That says she can't leave.
[27491.06s -> 27492.31s]  Get out of there.
[27492.31s -> 27492.81s]  Get over here.
[27493.80s -> 27494.68s]  You just sit over there.
[27496.31s -> 27497.43s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[27497.43s -> 27497.93s]  Hey!
[27501.70s -> 27502.42s]  Shut it down.
[27502.42s -> 27502.92s]  Shut it down.
[27504.15s -> 27504.79s]  Shut it down.
[27507.69s -> 27508.49s]  Control panel.
[27508.49s -> 27508.99s]  Turn it off.
[27548.95s -> 27550.23s]  It's time for this to stop.
[27554.18s -> 27554.90s]  Everyone go home.
[27578.10s -> 27578.60s]  Out.
[27579.22s -> 27579.94s]  Party's over.
[27579.94s -> 27580.44s]  Out.
[27584.38s -> 27594.58s]  What do you mean you can't go home?
[27627.45s -> 27628.17s]  How do we leave?
[27632.41s -> 27633.37s]  I can't, like, control...
[27633.37s -> 27634.01s]  I can't leave.
[27634.73s -> 27635.45s]  What was that noise?
[27637.98s -> 27638.48s]  Hospital.
[27641.45s -> 27642.01s]  Everything's fine.
[27643.66s -> 27645.18s]  Hospital, hospital, hospital?
[27645.90s -> 27654.55s]  All right, hospital.
[27654.55s -> 27655.05s]  Let's go.
[27655.51s -> 27659.83s]  Where's the hospital?
[27659.83s -> 27697.51s]  Yeah, it's good enough.
[27697.51s -> 27709.32s]  Did we bring the whole party?
[27709.56s -> 27710.56s]  Whoa!
[27715.53s -> 27717.13s]  Baby's coming out any second here.
[27722.36s -> 27724.12s]  Everybody's coming into the vet.
[27728.70s -> 27732.81s]  All right, just go over here.
[27733.61s -> 27735.83s]  Just sit down.
[27735.83s -> 27736.39s]  On the couch.
[27737.43s -> 27737.93s]  Sit.
[27738.87s -> 27739.51s]  Everybody go.
[27739.51s -> 27740.15s]  Everybody together.
[27740.15s -> 27740.65s]  Go.
[27745.46s -> 27746.82s]  Whose dog is this?
[27746.82s -> 27750.07s]  That's a patient.
[27750.07s -> 27750.57s]  Okay.
[27756.62s -> 27757.82s]  Is this the guy we met at the party?
[27764.15s -> 27767.88s]  No, I'm not coming out yet.
[27768.92s -> 27770.23s]  You have any beds in here?
[27777.43s -> 27777.83s]  I need...
[27777.83s -> 27778.33s]  I need this.
[27779.51s -> 27780.01s]  What?!
[27784.10s -> 27784.60s]  Huh?
[27784.90s -> 27785.40s]  Huh?
[27799.18s -> 27800.44s]  They brought it back.
[27806.20s -> 27807.08s]  What was that noise?
[27807.08s -> 27808.44s]  I need to investigate.
[27809.32s -> 27810.28s]  Oh my god.
[27810.28s -> 27810.92s]  All right.
[27810.92s -> 27811.72s]  Can I please?
[27812.52s -> 27817.74s]  Is it baby?
[27818.46s -> 27822.44s]  Sim is at full term.
[27826.39s -> 27827.75s]  Go over there and just nap.
[27827.75s -> 27828.63s]  Forget about this shit.
[27830.15s -> 27830.65s]  Oh!
[27839.54s -> 27840.58s]  Use your phone.
[27841.82s -> 27842.32s]  For what?
[27847.05s -> 27848.49s]  Travel to the hospital?
[27850.90s -> 27851.46s]  There we go.
[27851.46s -> 27852.18s]  The doctor's appointment.
[27852.90s -> 27855.95s]  Here we go.
[27896.12s -> 27898.90s]  Where the hell is she?
[27898.90s -> 27901.35s]  Did she just go home?
[27901.91s -> 27912.28s]  She's just at the doctor.
[27912.28s -> 27913.00s]  I see, I see.
[27913.00s -> 27913.50s]  Okay.
[27914.36s -> 27915.00s]  Baby, come out.
[27916.57s -> 27917.13s]  Tired.
[27917.13s -> 27917.53s]  It's time.
[27917.53s -> 27918.41s]  We'll need to rest soon.
[27918.41s -> 27920.01s]  Becomes exhausted in three hours.
[27920.01s -> 27920.57s]  I gotta...
[27920.57s -> 27923.29s]  I'm trying to get you to go to sleep,
[27923.29s -> 27927.77s]  but everyone is causing problems and making it impossible.
[27930.74s -> 27931.38s]  Everybody come home.
[27933.62s -> 27934.50s]  Come on.
[27934.50s -> 27941.77s]  What's your emergency?
[27941.77s -> 27942.27s]  No.
[27943.29s -> 27948.98s]  Get out of the doctor!
[27949.78s -> 27953.72s]  What was that?
[27954.34s -> 27958.38s]  Who the hell is this?
[27960.54s -> 27961.85s]  Oh, it's another cop.
[27961.85s -> 27962.35s]  Okay.
[27962.65s -> 27965.53s]  She's almost done.
[27966.33s -> 27967.38s]  This baby's coming.
[27983.67s -> 27984.17s]  Baby!
[27984.55s -> 27990.79s]  Why am I saying goodbye?
[28009.19s -> 28009.69s]  What's wrong?
[28010.63s -> 28011.43s]  Okay, travel.
[28012.39s -> 28013.03s]  Take them all.
[28015.05s -> 28016.94s]  Where are we going?
[28017.58s -> 28029.56s]  Click on her.
[28029.56s -> 28030.52s]  That's what I just did.
[28030.52s -> 28030.92s]  All right.
[28030.92s -> 28031.56s]  Click on her.
[28039.18s -> 28039.90s]  Go home.
[28044.46s -> 28050.41s]  She's not in labor yet.
[28050.41s -> 28052.01s]  Yeah, I can't go to the hospital right now.
[28056.98s -> 28059.74s]  Click on the actual genie.
[28059.74s -> 28060.30s]  This is her.
[28061.10s -> 28063.58s]  She's going home.
[28069.62s -> 28078.66s]  Click on the lamp to have the baby.
[28078.66s -> 28080.10s]  No, that's not how it works.
[28080.74s -> 28083.30s]  You need to wait till you get the labor passive.
[28084.02s -> 28086.73s]  Yeah, so what are you guys talking about?
[28087.37s -> 28091.69s]  I have to go into labor first.
[28092.33s -> 28093.94s]  I can't do anything about this.
[28094.66s -> 28097.51s]  Are you just going to jubate me?
[28098.39s -> 28101.54s]  All right, I'll be ready.
[28101.54s -> 28102.74s]  Buy a bassinet from the store.
[28108.36s -> 28109.00s]  Like, baby.
[28109.64s -> 28123.91s]  Is it even here?
[28130.86s -> 28131.90s]  The crib doesn't work either.
[28139.06s -> 28139.86s]  Bedroom?
[28139.86s -> 28145.08s]  I have to buy a crib or the baby will not come.
[28145.08s -> 28145.58s]  Okay.
[28149.03s -> 28158.97s]  Wait, is that good enough?
[28159.53s -> 28164.30s]  That's not a crib.
[28164.86s -> 28165.74s]  There is no crib.
[28195.42s -> 28197.42s]  Where's this crib you're talking about?
[28200.44s -> 28201.72s]  I'm in the kids menu.
[28202.28s -> 28204.52s]  I'm in the kids menu right now.
[28204.52s -> 28208.95s]  Oh, you guys are just fucking with me.
[28208.95s -> 28209.59s]  All right, whatever.
[28209.59s -> 28215.62s]  Let's go.
[28215.62s -> 28216.82s]  There is no crib.
[28216.82s -> 28217.94s]  You don't have to have a crib.
[28217.94s -> 28221.30s]  Here, I'll put the school desk over here.
[28221.30s -> 28238.30s]  Just sleep in this bed.
[28238.30s -> 28247.38s]  Get that baby out.
[28247.38s -> 28252.63s]  Today, the crib comes with the baby.
[28252.63s -> 28253.35s]  I knew it.
[28253.35s -> 28256.06s]  A bunch of liars here.
[28273.98s -> 28274.94s]  I need to eat.
[28274.94s -> 28278.97s]  Penny's office.
[28278.97s -> 28280.09s]  Penny got a job?
[28280.09s -> 28306.90s]  Put a bassinet in your home
[28306.90s -> 28308.18s]  and you'll have the option to give birth
[28308.18s -> 28309.78s]  or give birth at the hospital.
[28309.78s -> 28311.82s]  We just looked.
[28311.82s -> 28312.62s]  It doesn't exist.
[28324.17s -> 28326.73s]  This thing is called the rockabye bassinet.
[28330.54s -> 28331.50s]  Oh my god.
[28338.28s -> 28339.32s]  Rockabye.
[28339.32s -> 28340.84s]  I couldn't do BA.
[28342.82s -> 28343.54s]  All right, let's go.
[28343.54s -> 28344.42s]  Let's get this over with.
[28344.42s -> 28345.78s]  It's been a long stream.
[28345.78s -> 28349.27s]  It's been a long day.
[28349.27s -> 28350.63s]  Let's get this fucking baby out.
[28379.21s -> 28381.13s]  Oh, you could cook.
[28381.13s -> 28381.69s]  Good.
[28381.69s -> 28384.17s]  Still waiting for it.
[28395.58s -> 28398.30s]  Well, I actually just typed it and looked it up.
[28401.80s -> 28407.32s]  Oh, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.
[28407.32s -> 28408.68s]  No, god damn it.
[28408.68s -> 28416.28s]  Where is it?
[28416.28s -> 28417.32s]  What's at work?
[28419.88s -> 28431.35s]  Where's the gnome?
[28431.35s -> 28434.65s]  All right, come on.
[28434.65s -> 28435.13s]  Hurry up.
[28442.01s -> 28444.15s]  It's so late.
[28444.15s -> 28447.35s]  It's almost 3 a.m. Eastern right now.
[28447.35s -> 28449.43s]  We can't go to bed until this happens.
[28449.43s -> 28458.78s]  Just give it a minute.
[28458.78s -> 28478.31s]  What a day of work.
[28478.31s -> 28479.51s]  Penny came home and made it.
[28479.51s -> 28481.67s]  I thought that was just sort of $1.12.
[28482.31s -> 28484.49s]  I was like, what the hell did you do for work?
[28486.46s -> 28487.10s]  All right, get up.
[28493.62s -> 28498.20s]  Uh, is he going to leave that like that?
[28499.85s -> 28500.17s]  Really?
[28509.45s -> 28510.89s]  Fix that dickhead.
[28511.45s -> 28513.35s]  Oh, she's out of jail.
[28517.83s -> 28519.27s]  I don't know how she's alive.
[28521.72s -> 28525.08s]  Oh, this lady sucks.
[28528.36s -> 28530.12s]  I took I took her wig.
[28541.34s -> 28542.30s]  What the fuck?
[28545.46s -> 28546.90s]  I'm going to lose my mind.
[28547.62s -> 28549.72s]  I'm going to lose my mind.
[28560.94s -> 28564.23s]  I hate this, but I love it at the same time.
[28568.76s -> 28569.48s]  Okay, did you?
[28569.48s -> 28571.16s]  There's no more hair for you to take out.
[28571.72s -> 28574.36s]  Why do you hate this girl so much?
[28577.03s -> 28578.23s]  What did she do to you?
[28586.06s -> 28586.70s]  Where did she go?
[28587.26s -> 28590.18s]  All right, well, whatever.
[28590.18s -> 28594.58s]  I don't know why they hate each other so much.
[28612.68s -> 28613.08s]  Okay.
[28616.55s -> 28617.43s]  Enjoy your coffee.
[28618.73s -> 28621.05s]  I'm just waiting for this stupid baby to come up.
[28621.69s -> 28626.82s]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[28626.82s -> 28627.22s]  Here we go.
[28627.22s -> 28627.54s]  Here we go.
[28627.54s -> 28628.26s]  Here we go.
[28628.26s -> 28628.50s]  All right.
[28628.50s -> 28628.90s]  What do we do?
[28628.90s -> 28629.38s]  What do we do?
[28630.63s -> 28631.51s]  Going into labor.
[28631.51s -> 28632.79s]  We're going to bring everybody to the hospital.
[28633.35s -> 28635.27s]  Wait, invite the gnome over quick.
[28635.27s -> 28635.99s]  Call the gnome.
[28635.99s -> 28636.63s]  Call, call the gnome.
[28636.63s -> 28637.83s]  Call the gnome, gnome, gnome, gnome, gnome.
[28637.83s -> 28638.31s]  Call the gnome.
[28643.27s -> 28644.79s]  No, you don't know the gnome.
[28644.79s -> 28651.50s]  Call the gnome.
[28651.50s -> 28651.74s]  Quick.
[28657.91s -> 28659.11s]  Okay, get up everybody.
[28659.11s -> 28659.83s]  Hospital, let's go.
[28660.47s -> 28668.95s]  All right, the gnome's here.
[28668.95s -> 28669.51s]  Half baby.
[28670.07s -> 28674.55s]  This is the moment of truth.
[28674.55s -> 28676.31s]  We've been waiting for this for like three hours.
[28677.78s -> 28678.34s]  Here we go.
[28679.06s -> 28685.64s]  Did you just get you?
[28685.64s -> 28687.08s]  Wait, you didn't just drop it in here?
[28692.30s -> 28698.81s]  Uh, congratulations.
[28698.81s -> 28699.77s]  It's a boy.
[28699.77s -> 28701.45s]  I just gave birth to a baby boy.
[28701.45s -> 28702.41s]  This baby needs a name.
[28777.32s -> 28780.65s]  That's, that's fucking ridiculous.
[28782.22s -> 28783.18s]  What is that noise?
[28784.06s -> 28801.10s]  All right, it's time for the baby to grow up.
[28808.90s -> 28811.06s]  Doc, you get away from that baby.
[28811.78s -> 28813.06s]  Get away from that baby.
[28813.06s -> 28814.02s]  Get away from the baby.
[28815.34s -> 28815.82s]  Get away.
[28817.48s -> 28818.92s]  Get the fuck away from that baby.
[28819.56s -> 28820.20s]  Get out of here.
[28821.32s -> 28822.76s]  You motherfucker.
[28822.76s -> 28824.36s]  No, don't touch that baby.
[28827.06s -> 28828.02s]  Somebody help.
[28829.50s -> 28830.14s]  No, neither.
[28830.14s -> 28830.78s]  You either.
[28830.78s -> 28831.82s]  You go back over here.
[28839.54s -> 28840.82s]  Get over to the baby.
[28840.82s -> 28842.90s]  Stop doing what just happened.
[28848.92s -> 28851.80s]  Okay, get over, get over here.
[28853.66s -> 28855.66s]  Somebody pick up the baby.
[28856.22s -> 28857.50s]  Somebody pick up the baby.
[28861.82s -> 28863.26s]  Okay, thank you.
[28868.22s -> 28881.37s]  Wasn't gonna let that motherfucker get near this baby.
[28881.37s -> 28882.81s]  Why is the gnome here?
[28882.81s -> 28884.57s]  Oh yeah, I invited the gnome over.
[28885.66s -> 28887.26s]  All right, I got, I'm done.
[28887.26s -> 28887.58s]  I'm done.
[28887.58s -> 28888.30s]  I'm going to bed.
[28890.17s -> 28891.77s]  I can't fucking handle this anymore.
[28896.63s -> 28897.83s]  I'm gonna age the baby.
[28898.79s -> 28903.75s]  All right, age up.
[28903.75s -> 28905.58s]  Here we go.
[28905.58s -> 28909.05s]  Let's see who you grow.
[28909.05s -> 28910.57s]  Wait, did I just do that to her?
[28910.57s -> 28911.70s]  Who did I just do that to?
[28921.77s -> 28923.53s]  I just made her older.
[28928.52s -> 28931.48s]  Yeah, no, no, no, no.
[28932.98s -> 28933.70s]  Get off.
[28933.70s -> 28934.18s]  Get away.
[28934.18s -> 28934.50s]  Get away.
[28934.50s -> 28934.82s]  Get away.
[28934.82s -> 28935.14s]  Get away.
[28935.14s -> 28935.54s]  Get away.
[28935.54s -> 28936.02s]  Get away.
[28936.02s -> 28936.90s]  Don't feed them.
[28936.90s -> 28938.18s]  Don't feed that baby.
[28938.18s -> 28938.82s]  Put it down.
[28940.68s -> 28941.96s]  Do not feed this baby.
[28944.34s -> 28945.46s]  Watch the baby.
[28956.60s -> 28957.16s]  Oh no.
[28958.14s -> 28959.34s]  No, the gnome is fine.
[28959.34s -> 28960.70s]  The gnome is gonna be just fine.
[28962.74s -> 28964.81s]  I trust the gnome.
[28964.81s -> 28966.09s]  That's weird for me to say that.
[28966.09s -> 28966.73s]  Excuse me.
[28969.35s -> 28970.07s]  Huh?
[28970.07s -> 28972.23s]  Oh, I thought she just cast a magic spell.
[28976.39s -> 28978.07s]  Toddler's day spent playing with toys,
[28978.07s -> 28978.71s]  exploring the world,
[28978.71s -> 28980.71s]  and learning to communicate with words instead of tears.
[28981.35s -> 28983.91s]  Oh wait, this is the perfect time to start skill building.
[28985.82s -> 28986.22s]  Okay.
[28988.98s -> 28989.70s]  Inquisitive.
[29007.05s -> 29009.21s]  All right, here we go.
[29010.41s -> 29012.09s]  How I need to I want to age.
[29013.45s -> 29014.01s]  Age up.
[29015.30s -> 29016.18s]  Age up.
[29016.18s -> 29021.90s]  Did age up work?
[29025.86s -> 29027.86s]  Okay, Peter aged up.
[29027.86s -> 29028.74s]  Aspirations.
[29028.74s -> 29030.66s]  All right, creativity.
[29030.66s -> 29031.62s]  That sounds good to me.
[29033.13s -> 29035.66s]  And cheerful.
[29035.66s -> 29036.46s]  That sounds pretty good.
[29039.18s -> 29043.77s]  Okay.
[29049.45s -> 29050.17s]  Creativity.
[29054.17s -> 29055.53s]  A botanist.
[29055.53s -> 29055.77s]  Sure.
[29057.94s -> 29059.14s]  And a romantic.
[29059.14s -> 29059.54s]  Come on.
[29063.02s -> 29069.03s]  Actually, dude, what a fucking insane childhood you have.
[29071.29s -> 29072.49s]  You're just crying.
[29073.29s -> 29078.42s]  You have the mental, you have the brain of a one-day-old.
[29078.98s -> 29081.13s]  How did you, you already got your phone?
[29083.48s -> 29083.96s]  All right.
[29106.63s -> 29113.38s]  Okay, I lost my mind.
[29113.38s -> 29114.18s]  I gotta get out of here.
[29117.13s -> 29123.51s]  Hey, we watched him grow up.
[29127.22s -> 29128.26s]  I'm never doing this again.
[29141.85s -> 29143.37s]  Someone just said you're a mean person.
[29144.01s -> 29153.58s]  That didn't take eight hours.
[29154.78s -> 29156.22s]  I was like, I'll bring him back.
[29156.86s -> 29157.66s]  I'll bring him back.
[29158.70s -> 29159.34s]  Just wait.
[29159.34s -> 29160.22s]  I'll bring him back.
[29160.22s -> 29161.90s]  Everybody settle down.
[29164.89s -> 29165.85s]  Plead for Peter.
[29175.85s -> 29177.45s]  And it has been accepted.
[29178.33s -> 29193.53s]  What's the cheat for it?
[29193.53s -> 29193.61s]  What?
[29193.61s -> 29194.09s]  How do I cheat?
[29195.53s -> 29198.38s]  How do I bring him back?
[29198.38s -> 29199.10s]  What's the cheat for it?
[29206.23s -> 29207.19s]  There is no cheat for it.
[29224.74s -> 29229.08s]  That was so uncalled for.
[29229.80s -> 29237.93s]  Oh, at least he got to get to like 32.
[29237.93s -> 29242.30s]  You know, he went from an infant to like 40.
[29254.73s -> 29255.85s]  32 seconds.
[29255.85s -> 29256.73s]  Finish the fight.
[29256.73s -> 29257.69s]  There is no fight.
[29267.75s -> 29280.95s]  No, this is a gnome stream, no.
[29287.29s -> 29295.54s]  I got a fucking headache.
[29299.14s -> 29299.78s]  What a joke.
[29301.80s -> 29308.42s]  Yeah, I need a cup of coffee after that one.
[29309.06s -> 29313.67s]  He lived until 32 in a bathroom.
[29337.58s -> 29347.72s]  Let me just like seriously like applaud the Sims 4 modding community.
[29347.72s -> 29348.84s]  What a hell of a job.
[29348.84s -> 29351.90s]  Like how much outrageous shit.
[29351.90s -> 29353.74s]  I can't even believe this stuff is even in the game.
[29354.62s -> 29359.14s]  Did it once before, did it again.
[29359.14s -> 29362.26s]  And there's still somehow interesting things to look at.
[29367.35s -> 29368.89s]  My eyes are itchy.
[29371.72s -> 29373.32s]  All right, I think that's going to be it.
[29374.28s -> 29375.40s]  Here's who's left standing.
[29378.18s -> 29378.74s]  The genie.
[29380.95s -> 29381.99s]  I don't even know who this is.
[29384.68s -> 29385.56s]  Detective, whatever.
[29387.51s -> 29388.23s]  I don't know who this is.
[29394.34s -> 29395.62s]  I didn't make this lady, did I?
[29396.34s -> 29398.17s]  Oh, it's a caterer.
[29398.17s -> 29402.25s]  I evicted this lady eight, nine hours ago and then I brought them back as a caterer
[29402.25s -> 29403.53s]  and then made them part of the family.
[29405.53s -> 29410.50s]  No one, here's an interesting piece of information here.
[29410.50s -> 29412.26s]  Nobody here is from any original family.
[29412.90s -> 29416.26s]  The gnome was not supposed to be part of any family.
[29418.78s -> 29419.50s]  Everybody's gone.
[29420.06s -> 29422.12s]  The gnome was just the drug dealer.
[29430.60s -> 29433.72s]  Now, thank you for joining me in the nine hour car joke
[29435.32s -> 29437.24s]  with some other random stuff sprinkled in.
[29437.96s -> 29439.96s]  Who the hell is this?
[29440.60s -> 29461.66s]  What the fuck are you doing?
[29462.22s -> 29465.29s]  Is that Peter?
[29466.84s -> 29467.48s]  No, it's not.
[29468.12s -> 29474.76s]  That's not Peter.
[29474.76s -> 29477.56s]  That's some random person that died here like six days ago.
[29488.31s -> 29489.43s]  There's another person here.
[29489.43s -> 29489.99s]  Who's this?
[29490.55s -> 29497.61s]  Who is this person?
[29497.61s -> 29519.06s]  Is he going to drink out of a dirty cup?
[29519.54s -> 29525.56s]  Where are you going?
[29527.21s -> 29528.41s]  Scared by ghost.
[29530.06s -> 29532.38s]  Oh, I thought he was scared by the ghost.
[29533.10s -> 29535.38s]  Oh, I get it.
[29535.38s -> 29536.34s]  They come and they haunt you.
[29537.54s -> 29554.42s]  I'm so confused right now.
[29554.42s -> 29561.30s]  You've not wake up from that.
[29561.30s -> 29562.26s]  It just turned him green.
[29563.06s -> 29570.58s]  Take the soul.
[29577.50s -> 29579.10s]  Age down the ghost.
[29579.10s -> 29580.06s]  Age down the ghost.
[29580.06s -> 29581.02s]  What do you mean age down?
[29581.02s -> 29581.98s]  Age down until what?
[29582.54s -> 29587.86s]  You're about to use the computer?
[29592.87s -> 29594.55s]  What the fuck are you two doing here?
[29596.28s -> 29597.64s]  I have no clue.
[29597.64s -> 29600.12s]  He's picking up the demon evil book.
[29605.59s -> 29613.22s]  Uh, that's okay.
[29613.22s -> 29613.94s]  That's not good.
[29614.50s -> 29616.70s]  That's all he wanted to see.
[29616.70s -> 29618.22s]  He's getting a good he's getting a spell.
[29618.22s -> 29619.42s]  Yeah, how's this for a spell?
[29629.50s -> 29630.46s]  Did it work?
[29630.46s -> 29635.67s]  I don't think I don't think you can do it.
[29645.00s -> 29646.52s]  At least you're cleaning up after yourself.
[29646.52s -> 29647.32s]  That's nice of you.
[29652.26s -> 29653.54s]  I don't think it can work.
[29653.54s -> 29656.30s]  Nah, you can't do it to uh to ghost.
[29656.30s -> 29665.51s]  I don't think all right somebody needs to get up.
[29665.51s -> 29669.67s]  Get up and uh let me try to one last thing.
[29669.67s -> 29670.23s]  Where's the book?
[29670.23s -> 29671.03s]  Where do you put it away?
[29672.41s -> 29673.37s]  Book of Chaos.
[29673.37s -> 29674.57s]  Put it down in the world over here.
[29675.29s -> 29678.60s]  Let's get these evil spirits out of here.
[29679.24s -> 29681.62s]  All right, where'd you put it?
[29681.62s -> 29684.84s]  I'm not in the trash.
[29685.64s -> 29687.00s]  All right, uh, read.
[29687.00s -> 29687.40s]  Put it.
[29687.40s -> 29688.52s]  Ask to be partners in crime.
[29688.52s -> 29689.24s]  Burn Sim.
[29689.96s -> 29691.00s]  Drown Sim in pee.
[29700.60s -> 29701.48s]  Where are they?
[29701.48s -> 29715.66s]  Can I make the ghost streak?
[29718.34s -> 29718.82s]  Who is this?
[29732.20s -> 29736.04s]  Um, naked ghost is more clothes.
[29736.84s -> 29743.56s]  Okay, bye.
[29743.56s -> 29749.37s]  We also have embarrass a sim to death.
[29751.48s -> 29752.28s]  I wanted to drown.
[29768.06s -> 29780.90s]  He's still alive.
[29783.27s -> 29783.83s]  He's still alive.
[29784.23s -> 29784.87s]  He's not dead yet.
[29784.87s -> 29786.23s]  He's not dead and I got it.
[29786.23s -> 29786.55s]  I'm good.
[29787.19s -> 29792.47s]  He's still alive.
[29792.47s -> 29793.75s]  I caught it right at the end.
[29793.75s -> 29798.12s]  I didn't save the game either.
[29798.12s -> 29801.40s]  I saved it before that like 30, 40 minutes ago.
[29802.74s -> 29804.02s]  Show us proof that he's still alive.
[29804.02s -> 29804.26s]  Sure.
[29804.90s -> 29829.19s]  Oh, that was as chaotic as I thought it was going to be.
[29839.80s -> 29841.72s]  That was a perfect opportunity to gnome chat.
[29841.72s -> 29843.32s]  My brain can't think that far.
[29843.32s -> 29845.64s]  It's been eight plus hours of this.
[29846.52s -> 29849.80s]  Just constant just total absolute bullshit.
[29854.18s -> 29855.38s]  Oh my god.
[29860.18s -> 29861.06s]  Thank you all so much.
[29861.70s -> 29864.02s]  That was the part two of The Sims 4.
[29866.15s -> 29866.39s]  Hell.
[29867.19s -> 29871.42s]  I thought that was hilarious.
[29872.95s -> 29875.51s]  Maybe too many car jokes, but you know what happens.
[29875.51s -> 29880.55s]  Can't wait for part three.
[29880.55s -> 29881.91s]  Uh, we'll have to see about that.
[29882.63s -> 29885.94s]  Sorry we went really late.
[29885.94s -> 29892.44s]  I know a lot of people couldn't stick around because it is very, very, very late.
[29893.34s -> 29900.34s]  So I know a lot of you had to leave, but I will see you guys again.
[29900.34s -> 29903.06s]  Uh, I don't know necessarily.
[29903.06s -> 29904.66s]  I might be streaming.
[29905.38s -> 29908.90s]  I'm not streaming tomorrow or today technically for a lot of you guys.
[29910.02s -> 29912.02s]  Because I have a doctor's appointment on Friday.
[29912.02s -> 29917.02s]  So today, uh, Saturday I'm trying to think what's going on.
[29917.02s -> 29918.70s]  I think I have something I have to do on Saturday.
[29920.92s -> 29922.28s]  I know I'm not streaming tomorrow.
[29923.08s -> 29925.05s]  We'll see.
[29925.05s -> 29925.69s]  I'll let you know.
[29925.69s -> 29926.33s]  I'll let you know.
[29926.33s -> 29928.65s]  I'll make a tweet or, uh, I'll be in the discord.
[29930.76s -> 29936.20s]  The next stream I'm going to maybe try to set up the next stream to be the pogo stick
[29936.20s -> 29937.40s]  gamer challenge with Joel.
[29942.22s -> 29944.70s]  So we'll see if I can get that at some point this weekend.
[29945.93s -> 29948.65s]  Yeah, check his schedule.
[29956.36s -> 29958.84s]  Don't accidentally go to the vet instead of the doctor.
[29959.80s -> 29970.90s]  I will try, but that is a long, long stream of The Sims 4.
[29972.09s -> 29973.93s]  That didn't feel like very long to me at all.
[29974.81s -> 29978.17s]  The first three hours of that though, or two hours or so, was making people.
[29979.05s -> 29982.12s]  But I'll get in touch with Joel.
[29983.91s -> 29984.95s]  And let's go to the bits.
[29985.83s -> 29989.83s]  We've got about, uh, not very many, I don't think.
[29992.73s -> 29995.69s]  I don't think there's a whole lot of bits to go through.
[29999.59s -> 30000.95s]  Wait, as in Vinesauce Joel?
[30000.95s -> 30005.03s]  Yeah, we're going to be doing a little co-op stream over the next few days.
[30005.75s -> 30006.89s]  I'll let you know.
[30009.69s -> 30014.57s]  But going all the way back to making Mr. Cassadan for the 250.
[30015.29s -> 30018.50s]  Can we listen to this next time you do Picross?
[30020.17s -> 30021.77s]  Uh, what is it?
[30021.77s -> 30022.65s]  Let's see.
[30022.65s -> 30026.92s]  This is called becoming a gorilla fast.
[30031.08s -> 30034.28s]  Pre-experience subliminal frequency hypnosis.
[30034.28s -> 30035.24s]  I ain't going to listen to that.
[30036.12s -> 30038.58s]  That's like, that's freaking me out.
[30039.40s -> 30039.96s]  Just the name.
[30040.76s -> 30047.11s]  It's like a brown noise.
[30049.02s -> 30049.66s]  But thank you.
[30051.02s -> 30058.06s]  Uh, thank you to Robot Joan for the $2.40, uh, 54 cents.
[30058.62s -> 30061.59s]  Hey, Jeremy, just want to let you know, I want to know how your day is.
[30061.59s -> 30063.83s]  You don't need to ask me as I am a robot boy.
[30063.83s -> 30067.03s]  Also, Garfield, that challenge is happening since my cartoon is better.
[30067.99s -> 30069.59s]  Also, I have a giant bulb head.
[30070.39s -> 30075.66s]  Getting a cartoon throw down here.
[30077.03s -> 30077.51s]  Somehow.
[30078.07s -> 30081.43s]  Thank you, Robot Joan for the $2.50.
[30081.99s -> 30082.97s]  Appreciate it.
[30083.61s -> 30087.40s]  Uh, thank you, Zach, for the $4.
[30088.12s -> 30089.48s]  Did it say show love?
[30089.48s -> 30089.88s]  Thank you.
[30091.51s -> 30092.63s]  Trust no one.
[30093.35s -> 30095.16s]  Thank you, trust no one for the $2.50.
[30095.80s -> 30097.38s]  Hello, Jeremy.
[30097.38s -> 30098.74s]  You are back from the virtual world.
[30098.74s -> 30100.18s]  Your VR experience was something.
[30100.74s -> 30103.30s]  And how nice to see Star and you playing games together again.
[30103.30s -> 30107.78s]  But to get Star back, you had to make him be in robe, wear a mask,
[30107.78s -> 30111.38s]  speak into a voice morpher, watch stream from phone, crawl into window,
[30111.38s -> 30112.90s]  crawl through it during 30 minutes.
[30112.90s -> 30113.14s]  Wow.
[30113.14s -> 30113.62s]  Anytime.
[30114.18s -> 30115.06s]  It's movie time.
[30115.78s -> 30118.50s]  Last time you, Mark and Will tried your best at dad jokes.
[30118.50s -> 30119.22s]  Those were not good.
[30119.22s -> 30120.98s]  No, it's just playground insults.
[30125.16s -> 30126.92s]  Did you see the money that was in that draw?
[30131.14s -> 30136.04s]  We got a, uh, Jeremy Elberton and Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg insult each other.
[30136.60s -> 30138.42s]  Let's get it on the screen.
[30138.42s -> 30139.06s]  Let's take a look.
[30153.10s -> 30153.74s]  Previously.
[30154.38s -> 30155.18s]  Lazy boy.
[30159.99s -> 30162.87s]  Dad, this is the, uh, I watched the one before this.
[30164.47s -> 30165.27s]  This is another one.
[30165.27s -> 30168.87s]  We're with Germer and Mark Wahlberg about to play the playground insults game.
[30170.68s -> 30171.64s]  It's good to see you again.
[30172.28s -> 30174.34s]  You look like a made in a paper.
[30176.26s -> 30179.22s]  You could call me a fucking dumb dickhead McGee and I wouldn't even care.
[30179.78s -> 30180.34s]  I mean, I would.
[30180.34s -> 30182.58s]  It might, it might hurt my feelings a little bit, but don't do that.
[30182.58s -> 30183.06s]  It would be mean.
[30184.18s -> 30185.46s]  You're not a nice person.
[30186.10s -> 30186.98s]  Easy now.
[30186.98s -> 30187.48s]  Easy.
[30188.58s -> 30190.02s]  This guy sucks.
[30190.02s -> 30192.34s]  Like this guy sucks.
[30192.34s -> 30194.10s]  Like what a fucking loser.
[30196.18s -> 30199.38s]  Your hair looks like a brilipad that I want to scrub my sack with.
[30202.98s -> 30204.26s]  Why the fuck?
[30204.82s -> 30206.02s]  I thought he was going to jump on me.
[30207.19s -> 30208.95s]  Your hair is like baby hair.
[30209.99s -> 30212.71s]  You're a wonderfully looking human being.
[30213.27s -> 30214.07s]  What are you doing?
[30214.07s -> 30215.19s]  He's being sarcastic.
[30215.19s -> 30217.27s]  Oh, fucking swell boy.
[30217.83s -> 30219.59s]  Your feet smell like weed.
[30220.55s -> 30221.03s]  What?
[30221.03s -> 30222.31s]  When did I ever say that?
[30224.07s -> 30225.19s]  That's very kind of you, dude.
[30225.91s -> 30227.03s]  You know, just fuck it.
[30227.03s -> 30228.23s]  You are fucking tiny.
[30228.95s -> 30230.39s]  That doesn't sound very original.
[30231.11s -> 30232.63s]  Were you popular in high school?
[30234.28s -> 30234.52s]  No.
[30235.48s -> 30237.56s]  Remember I told you you could make me say anything you want.
[30238.84s -> 30241.62s]  I will.
[30241.62s -> 30242.10s]  Get ready.
[30244.39s -> 30245.75s]  You smell like baby barf.
[30248.26s -> 30248.76s]  You'll see.
[30249.80s -> 30250.30s]  You'll see.
[30251.00s -> 30251.96s]  You look 90.
[30253.78s -> 30257.37s]  Your mama raised you well.
[30259.24s -> 30261.00s]  You look like a James Bond villain.
[30262.15s -> 30267.61s]  You wish you could scrub your sack with my brillo head if you had a sack.
[30268.89s -> 30270.09s]  You sackless bitch.
[30271.13s -> 30272.81s]  If you think that aliens don't exist.
[30273.37s -> 30275.05s]  Oh boy, I've got some news for you.
[30276.09s -> 30280.01s]  In your movies, I can see you and your coverage
[30280.01s -> 30283.13s]  mouthing the line of the other actor silently to yourself.
[30284.66s -> 30285.54s]  Don't say such a thing.
[30285.54s -> 30286.50s]  It makes me feel bad.
[30287.06s -> 30287.86s]  I'm an actor.
[30287.86s -> 30288.34s]  You know what I mean?
[30288.34s -> 30289.30s]  I'm a fucking actor.
[30290.34s -> 30291.94s]  You're a terrible actor.
[30293.30s -> 30294.42s]  Like, oh great, okay.
[30294.98s -> 30296.18s]  Fuck, you know that, you know that like
[30296.18s -> 30298.50s]  fucked up looking freak show character, the Joker?
[30299.54s -> 30301.62s]  You look like the Joker without makeup on.
[30302.58s -> 30310.22s]  You got a great ass for a guy from Boston.
[30315.77s -> 30316.41s]  Next time.
[30316.41s -> 30316.73s]  Let's see.
[30316.73s -> 30317.13s]  What is it?
[30317.13s -> 30317.85s]  Let's see.
[30317.85s -> 30320.65s]  Hollywood's nobody's shutting down reporters.
[30321.45s -> 30322.41s]  Coming up next.
[30323.05s -> 30327.26s]  Good luck.
[30327.26s -> 30329.64s]  This is never going to end, is it?
[30334.50s -> 30335.62s]  Shutting down reporters.
[30338.94s -> 30340.38s]  Yeah, I told you guys this before though.
[30340.38s -> 30344.54s]  I've said 85% of every word in the human dictionary.
[30345.34s -> 30348.92s]  You talk about hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
[30348.92s -> 30351.24s]  and maybe even potentially thousands of hours on stream
[30353.16s -> 30356.78s]  and eight, nine, a hundred videos.
[30357.58s -> 30358.94s]  I've said almost every word.
[30362.50s -> 30367.93s]  Like at least 82% of every word.
[30367.93s -> 30368.73s]  Humble brag.
[30372.28s -> 30373.24s]  Shut up.
[30373.24s -> 30376.52s]  But thank you Trust No One for that video.
[30377.38s -> 30378.26s]  It was great.
[30378.26s -> 30378.66s]  Thank you.
[30380.97s -> 30382.57s]  Hey Divus, thanks for the 250, Divus.
[30383.70s -> 30385.70s]  Beware, I live thanks to the 250.
[30385.70s -> 30387.94s]  Hey Jerry, I was just speeding around in my neighborhood
[30387.94s -> 30390.34s]  outside of Vegas but now I gotta rush home to catch your stream.
[30391.22s -> 30391.72s]  Vroom.
[30392.18s -> 30393.29s]  Oh, I didn't give a link.
[30393.29s -> 30394.41s]  What am I, stupid?
[30394.41s -> 30395.13s]  Here.
[30395.13s -> 30396.57s]  Yeah, I am pretty dumb, aren't I?
[30396.57s -> 30398.17s]  Yeah, VR Josh got it.
[30399.42s -> 30400.38s]  That's the link right there.
[30403.51s -> 30404.79s]  Thank you, VR Josh.
[30404.79s -> 30409.72s]  Yeah, I'll do it again.
[30409.72s -> 30410.76s]  Yeah, watch this.
[30411.40s -> 30412.52s]  Now you got a double link.
[30415.90s -> 30417.74s]  Uh, but thank you, beware, I live.
[30418.54s -> 30419.50s]  Thanks for driving around.
[30420.14s -> 30421.91s]  Mostly lost, thanks for the 250.
[30421.91s -> 30424.63s]  I've said this before but if your stream is nothing but character creation streams,
[30424.63s -> 30425.51s]  I'd still enjoy it.
[30426.15s -> 30428.28s]  I'm already in tears, thank you for this.
[30429.08s -> 30430.04s]  I think that's half the fun.
[30430.84s -> 30435.56s]  For me, half the fun is not even getting in the game and having them do crazy shit.
[30436.20s -> 30439.77s]  It's making them in the first place.
[30439.77s -> 30442.33s]  That's why I spend more than two or three hours just dicking around,
[30442.33s -> 30444.41s]  having fun, making like two or three different families.
[30445.61s -> 30455.30s]  This is just one of those streams where it just happens in front of your face,
[30455.30s -> 30455.80s]  you know what I mean?
[30456.92s -> 30462.84s]  Sometimes, oh look, I wonder what, I wonder maybe I could come up with something funny.
[30462.84s -> 30466.04s]  No, this should, whatever, I'm in the seat here watching it with you guys.
[30472.32s -> 30475.12s]  Just whatever they decide to do and how whatever it happens.
[30475.84s -> 30481.69s]  But thank you, mostly lost, it means a lot.
[30482.25s -> 30486.48s]  And again, mostly lost another 250.
[30487.12s -> 30491.29s]  I love how you made Barry both self-assured and gloomy.
[30503.80s -> 30506.36s]  Sometimes he just picked randomly, you know?
[30506.36s -> 30510.12s]  There were five story arcs where the best story arc was absolutely the genie.
[30513.00s -> 30517.72s]  I don't know, the cat running away was pretty ridiculous.
[30518.44s -> 30521.63s]  I think the entire arc of the genie was the best though.
[30521.63s -> 30523.15s]  From start to finish, that was the longest one.
[30523.15s -> 30525.07s]  That took about like almost four hours of time.
[30526.27s -> 30530.68s]  Going on a date with a banana, the genie being in the game to begin with.
[30532.67s -> 30534.51s]  The two gangs, I forgot about that.
[30534.51s -> 30536.99s]  So much happened, it's just too much to even think about.
[30538.03s -> 30542.64s]  And there had to be a car in every one of them.
[30545.40s -> 30549.20s]  I like mod abused that car joke.
[30550.73s -> 30553.37s]  It was just, it's just so out of control.
[30553.37s -> 30556.01s]  It's the most brutal, it's so fast.
[30560.89s -> 30562.97s]  It hit the crib with the car, it was close.
[30563.69s -> 30574.92s]  It's just the abruptness of the car, yeah.
[30575.72s -> 30585.07s]  But thank you, appreciate it.
[30589.82s -> 30593.50s]  Thank you Commando Nam for the five, six, seven, eight dollars here.
[30596.65s -> 30598.33s]  More than that, 18 dollars actually.
[30600.96s -> 30601.68s]  Thank you so much.
[30604.36s -> 30605.96s]  Failing my classes can cheer me up.
[30607.80s -> 30610.68s]  Failing your classes, well, here's what I'll tell you.
[30612.27s -> 30619.15s]  Uh, try to spend a little more time focusing on schoolwork.
[30620.22s -> 30621.66s]  I know it can be a huge pain.
[30625.44s -> 30628.86s]  Unfortunately, you know, you just got to get it done.
[30630.72s -> 30631.60s]  That's just the way it is.
[30631.60s -> 30633.52s]  I had problems in school when I was in high school.
[30634.24s -> 30637.21s]  But you just got to get it done, you just got to do it.
[30638.01s -> 30642.88s]  Can't focus on school with eight hour Sims 4 streams.
[30644.62s -> 30645.58s]  You just got to do your best.
[30645.58s -> 30652.00s]  Do your best and maybe, maybe disconnect a little bit from the computer.
[30652.64s -> 30654.88s]  You know, you saw me throw away the computer in the trash.
[30655.60s -> 30663.31s]  Put some music on, relax.
[30665.60s -> 30669.60s]  Grab like a tea or something and just focus on doing some work.
[30670.24s -> 30675.52s]  That's what I used to have to do.
[30681.40s -> 30682.68s]  I work at a computer.
[30682.68s -> 30685.64s]  Well, if you, but I mean, that's true, I forgot.
[30685.64s -> 30687.16s]  Like I used to like use like paper.
[30687.96s -> 30689.24s]  Everybody needs a computer now.
[30689.88s -> 30691.00s]  Shit, this advice is bad.
[30695.69s -> 30697.69s]  Hey, throw your computer in the trash.
[30699.31s -> 30701.39s]  You know, the thing that you probably need
[30701.39s -> 30708.97s]  to do your assignment on, you just got to do your best.
[30708.97s -> 30713.87s]  Do your best and just focus whenever you can get the opportunity to.
[30713.87s -> 30715.23s]  It's really the best advice I can give.
[30717.55s -> 30718.83s]  Everybody's a little different though.
[30720.72s -> 30721.12s]  Good luck.
[30725.00s -> 30726.44s]  Mostly lost, thanks to the 250.
[30726.44s -> 30729.32s]  I'm now fully convinced the Vroomer is a stream sniper.
[30730.46s -> 30730.86s]  Me too.
[30731.50s -> 30737.48s]  Freudian weapon, thanks to the 250.
[30738.75s -> 30739.39s]  Happy Thursday.
[30739.39s -> 30740.51s]  Happy Thursday to you as well.
[30740.51s -> 30741.31s]  Well, now it's Friday.
[30745.02s -> 30745.66s]  Now it's Friday.
[30750.28s -> 30753.48s]  Commando Nam, thanks again for the 550 here.
[30755.85s -> 30757.77s]  One of my assignments is biology.
[30757.77s -> 30758.97s]  Can you help in biology?
[30761.60s -> 30763.84s]  I don't, I don't think, I didn't even take biology.
[30764.48s -> 30766.20s]  I have no idea.
[30766.84s -> 30769.10s]  I can't help you.
[30769.10s -> 30776.06s]  Only knows that biology has frogs and fish and organisms.
[30776.06s -> 30778.83s]  And I didn't really learn that much biology.
[30779.39s -> 30781.79s]  I think we didn't spend very much time on it in science class.
[30781.79s -> 30785.16s]  We spent maybe two weeks on it.
[30785.72s -> 30787.16s]  I might be completely wrong.
[30787.88s -> 30791.00s]  I haven't been in high school in like 20 years.
[30791.56s -> 30792.60s]  It's been a long time.
[30792.60s -> 30793.24s]  I don't remember.
[30793.24s -> 30793.96s]  I can't even tell you.
[30794.76s -> 30800.41s]  I have no idea.
[30801.13s -> 30807.66s]  Have a good night, class.
[30808.54s -> 30809.50s]  See you again.
[30809.50s -> 30810.30s]  Yeah, it's a late one.
[30811.26s -> 30815.84s]  Peaceful Haley, thanks for the 250.
[30815.84s -> 30818.16s]  Hey Jeremy, just want to say that these kinds of streams are my favorite.
[30818.72s -> 30821.20s]  But I'm going to miss most of it because I'm going to go see a movie.
[30821.76s -> 30822.72s]  Anyways, hope you have fun.
[30822.72s -> 30825.84s]  And I can't wait to watch the VOD and 90% of it is just character creation.
[30826.40s -> 30827.76s]  And have a good night, Jerma, and chat.
[30829.77s -> 30830.49s]  Close, close.
[30830.49s -> 30831.37s]  Thank you, Peaceful Haley.
[30832.52s -> 30833.16s]  Not quite though.
[30833.80s -> 30837.66s]  We got eight hours and 35 minutes.
[30837.66s -> 30839.42s]  The first two hours and 30 minutes.
[30839.42s -> 30843.02s]  So it was about 30, 35% or so.
[30845.40s -> 30846.28s]  Just short of 90.
[30846.84s -> 30848.51s]  But I appreciate it.
[30849.72s -> 30850.76s]  I love these streams too.
[30851.40s -> 30854.92s]  I love just watching.
[30854.92s -> 30855.16s]  You know what?
[30855.16s -> 30859.96s]  One of my favorite things in the world is watching AI be AI.
[30861.31s -> 30864.89s]  And watching people who are math problems
[30865.77s -> 30869.61s]  come up with ways to do their internal math problem.
[30876.67s -> 30877.39s]  It's just fun.
[30882.00s -> 30883.76s]  Because you never know what they could possibly do.
[30883.76s -> 30885.04s]  Sure, I'm like the orchestra.
[30885.04s -> 30891.44s]  I've got the, who's the guy that runs the concert?
[30891.44s -> 30893.34s]  What's his name?
[30893.34s -> 30894.54s]  He's the guy with the little stick in his hand.
[30894.54s -> 30896.06s]  He's got the magic wand in his hand.
[30896.06s -> 30897.58s]  The guy, he's like a magician, but he's naughty.
[30897.58s -> 30898.46s]  Like a conductor.
[30900.52s -> 30903.88s]  I might be the conductor, but all the instruments are not run by me.
[30903.88s -> 30905.08s]  It's just fun to watch them play.
[30908.52s -> 30909.08s]  But thank you though.
[30909.08s -> 30910.52s]  Thank you Super Seal for the 250.
[30910.52s -> 30914.84s]  Can you enable the vroom B-T-T-V emote?
[30915.48s -> 30924.65s]  I might have to at this rate.
[30924.65s -> 30926.01s]  It's all you guys here.
[30926.73s -> 30930.33s]  I only have five slots though.
[30930.33s -> 30931.29s]  I'm going to delete something.
[30934.27s -> 30935.31s]  What's going to get the X?
[30935.31s -> 30935.71s]  I wonder.
[30936.35s -> 30939.24s]  Hey Space Cat.
[30940.04s -> 30941.40s]  Thank you Space Cat for the five bucks.
[30941.40s -> 30943.00s]  You make the most attractive sims.
[30943.56s -> 30946.94s]  I think that they're all beautiful.
[30947.58s -> 30953.88s]  Thank you Mostly Lost for the 250.
[30953.88s -> 30957.24s]  Let it be known that Elephant Feet is now permanently in your Google search history.
[30959.90s -> 30970.44s]  Uh, so I googled something way worse.
[30971.24s -> 30972.60s]  Like an hour after that.
[30979.16s -> 30983.80s]  I think I typed in like how to make a pregnancy happen in Sims or something.
[30983.80s -> 30984.36s]  Whatever it was.
[30985.08s -> 30990.83s]  It was like how do I force a baby out in Sims 4?
[30990.83s -> 30993.23s]  I've tried trying to like because somebody said you can like just click it.
[30994.12s -> 30995.00s]  It was something like that.
[30995.72s -> 31005.00s]  Yeah, that's way fucking worse than Elephant Feet.
[31016.65s -> 31017.21s]  But thank you.
[31017.85s -> 31022.25s]  We also had uh, Mostly Lost again 250.
[31022.25s -> 31024.81s]  Eight lives is basically the cat from this video.
[31025.37s -> 31027.21s]  Oh, I hope this ain't a cat.
[31027.21s -> 31028.33s]  Something happening to a cat.
[31030.67s -> 31032.59s]  Oh, I have seen this before.
[31033.31s -> 31037.07s]  This is uh, hey Michael Rappaport.
[31037.07s -> 31039.55s]  Hey, don't fucking look at me like that.
[31039.55s -> 31041.55s]  That's a weird looking fucking cat.
[31042.75s -> 31043.71s]  I've seen this video.
[31051.28s -> 31052.80s]  That is a classic video.
[31053.44s -> 31058.88s]  But thank you Mostly Lost again for your 250 again.
[31059.90s -> 31061.50s]  Robot Jones, thanks for the free bucks again.
[31061.50s -> 31061.98s]  Hey, I'm back.
[31061.98s -> 31065.58s]  I wanted to see what your channel looked like back in 2011.
[31065.58s -> 31069.26s]  So I used the Wayback Machine installed in my brain and I found this amazing.
[31069.26s -> 31069.98s]  Jerma Channel.
[31073.02s -> 31077.44s]  Uh, it started, it started in 2011.
[31078.08s -> 31080.56s]  It was in 10 maybe.
[31081.28s -> 31087.45s]  I was on other channels too.
[31088.78s -> 31093.48s]  They were like, I'm trying to think of like other,
[31093.48s -> 31097.24s]  there was other projects that I did on other people's channels long fucking time ago.
[31099.52s -> 31100.64s]  They don't like exist anymore.
[31100.64s -> 31102.24s]  I'm talking long, long time ago.
[31102.88s -> 31112.92s]  When I think about how long I've been on the internet for,
[31118.91s -> 31123.55s]  just, oh, I like, I'm going to make videos or like go back to Newgrounds.
[31124.27s -> 31130.86s]  Talking like 2004, 2003, 2004.
[31131.50s -> 31137.88s]  That's a long goddamn time ago.
[31138.44s -> 31142.09s]  Now, how do you think I know Bloerdal?
[31147.58s -> 31153.04s]  Me and Bloerdal met on Newgrounds like 14 years ago, something like that 15 years ago.
[31159.15s -> 31160.27s]  Might even be longer than that.
[31177.47s -> 31178.91s]  Newgrounds are old.
[31178.91s -> 31180.03s]  What happened to Newgrounds?
[31180.83s -> 31187.05s]  Is it still there?
[31187.37s -> 31188.25s]  Is it still working?
[31195.82s -> 31198.22s]  Is it still owned by the folks?
[31198.22s -> 31199.98s]  Does Tom Fulps still own that website?
[31204.64s -> 31207.60s]  Yeah, well, talking about someone who's been around for a long time.
[31210.73s -> 31212.25s]  That's a very long time ago.
[31214.59s -> 31223.63s]  But thank you for the trip down memory lane, RobotJones.
[31224.94s -> 31225.98s]  Appreciate it.
[31225.98s -> 31234.33s]  Tumblr banned porn so they migrated there.
[31235.13s -> 31242.06s]  That's a very long time ago.
[31242.06s -> 31244.22s]  Well, not that, but Newgrounds in general.
[31252.49s -> 31253.21s]  Sleep tight.
[31255.88s -> 31256.92s]  Uh, what else we got here?
[31256.92s -> 31259.56s]  We have, uh, Tingy.
[31259.56s -> 31260.44s]  Thanks for the 250.
[31261.00s -> 31261.72s]  Nice twerking.
[31261.72s -> 31262.44s]  Take some money.
[31263.24s -> 31271.76s]  Forgot what happened five hours ago.
[31271.76s -> 31272.08s]  Thank you.
[31272.08s -> 31273.20s]  Mostly lost for the 250.
[31273.20s -> 31275.20s]  What's your price for twerking on stream?
[31275.76s -> 31276.08s]  Zero.
[31277.40s -> 31278.68s]  Zero, zero, zero, zero.
[31285.00s -> 31286.04s]  Free twerking.
[31290.73s -> 31293.85s]  It's like hitting me like a ton of bricks right now that I'm just exhausted.
[31299.31s -> 31301.55s]  I'm coming down right now after that.
[31310.73s -> 31313.21s]  Pass the old man's bedtime.
[31313.29s -> 31314.01s]  Something like that.
[31317.08s -> 31321.88s]  Hey, where are we?
[31321.88s -> 31323.16s]  Future gamer, thanks for the 250.
[31323.16s -> 31326.68s]  There's a new VR RPG called Shadow Legend with voice recognition.
[31328.09s -> 31329.37s]  That came out today.
[31329.37s -> 31333.21s]  On a separate note, I have 18 rooms clipped and timed.
[31336.20s -> 31337.32s]  Shadow Legend.
[31337.32s -> 31339.23s]  I'm gonna have to look this up right now.
[31339.23s -> 31340.03s]  Shadow Legend.
[31346.92s -> 31350.36s]  RPG exclusive VR where you play as the grandmaster of the Knights Templar
[31350.36s -> 31351.72s]  in a story-driven medieval crusade.
[31351.72s -> 31353.80s]  Freely explore densely filled worlds.
[31354.52s -> 31357.96s]  And use your sword, bow, and magic to save the kingdom from destruction of Lord
[31358.84s -> 31359.48s]  Adaroth.
[31360.44s -> 31363.08s]  It's voice controlled?
[31367.85s -> 31368.89s]  I might have to play this.
[31369.77s -> 31370.73s]  This looks pretty good.
[31371.90s -> 31373.18s]  You can feed horses carrots.
[31375.13s -> 31376.25s]  All right, add that to the list.
[31382.67s -> 31383.47s]  Thank you, Future Gamer.
[31383.47s -> 31384.75s]  Thank you something or other for the 250.
[31384.75s -> 31386.91s]  Hey, German, it's me from the Applebee's.
[31386.91s -> 31389.79s]  Just want to say thank you again for taking the time to come over and say hi to us.
[31390.75s -> 31391.79s]  It was really cool to meet you.
[31392.43s -> 31394.91s]  As you might remember, it was my grandfather's 80th birthday.
[31394.91s -> 31398.99s]  And while your grandmother's 80th birthday and while her mind is slipping
[31398.99s -> 31400.27s]  and she doesn't know what twitch is,
[31400.99s -> 31404.03s]  she loves meeting new people and thought you were a charming fellow.
[31404.03s -> 31405.55s]  She had fun and I'm really grateful.
[31405.55s -> 31406.99s]  Just one quick question.
[31406.99s -> 31411.87s]  Why did you spit in my food and slip my grandmother your cell phone number?
[31415.29s -> 31417.90s]  Well, one, you were rude.
[31417.90s -> 31419.18s]  Two, she asked for it.
[31419.18s -> 31422.30s]  She like wanted me to give her my number.
[31422.30s -> 31423.66s]  She like asked me for the number.
[31424.38s -> 31427.95s]  What you don't tell the story that you're not telling is
[31427.95s -> 31432.97s]  you came and spit in my food first, three or four different times.
[31434.97s -> 31436.25s]  I didn't even know who you were.
[31437.76s -> 31442.16s]  You said, German, you screaming in my ear.
[31442.16s -> 31443.44s]  I'm at dinner with my girlfriend.
[31446.81s -> 31450.33s]  And then you did, you mashed up a bunch of Skittles in your mouth.
[31450.97s -> 31453.36s]  I'm like, what the fuck is this guy doing with this problem?
[31454.16s -> 31458.32s]  You swallowed and you did like the big daddy Adam Sandler movie spit.
[31458.96s -> 31464.32s]  But you dropped a huge, huge Skittle spit right onto my hamburger.
[31464.96s -> 31468.57s]  They said they were going to call the police,
[31469.77s -> 31471.05s]  which I don't know if they did or not.
[31471.05s -> 31471.93s]  You got out of there quick.
[31472.73s -> 31476.73s]  I walked over to your food and spit in yours.
[31476.73s -> 31477.85s]  I don't have any Skittles though.
[31478.57s -> 31484.01s]  Your grandmother simply said, by the way, what's your phone number?
[31484.57s -> 31491.77s]  So I can get in touch with you to repay you for the meal that my obnoxious grandson
[31491.77s -> 31492.33s]  just ruined.
[31494.43s -> 31498.03s]  So yeah, I gave my phone number to your grandmother.
[31498.03s -> 31502.19s]  The whole story, guys.
[31502.19s -> 31504.11s]  That's what happens when you don't get it.
[31504.11s -> 31504.67s]  Unbelievable.
[31511.29s -> 31512.09s]  I was there.
[31513.37s -> 31516.64s]  I saw it.
[31516.64s -> 31524.46s]  Is that what it takes?
[31525.18s -> 31531.26s]  Now, thank you something rather for the 250 and happy 80th birthday to your grandma.
[31531.82s -> 31536.44s]  I am now fully, mostly moistened thanks to the 250.
[31536.44s -> 31538.36s]  For anyone that may have doubted that German is a good man,
[31538.36s -> 31542.92s]  I'll have you know that when he saw an old man beat up his pregnant genie girlfriend,
[31542.92s -> 31545.16s]  he immediately ran him over with a car
[31545.16s -> 31547.88s]  and made sure that the genie had a place to stay.
[31547.88s -> 31549.00s]  What more proof do you need?
[31549.80s -> 31552.24s]  What the hell is going on there?
[31559.20s -> 31562.96s]  Lone MGR, thanks for the five dollars.
[31562.96s -> 31564.32s]  First time donating to a streamer.
[31564.32s -> 31564.96s]  Love your content.
[31564.96s -> 31565.68s]  Sorry, it ain't much.
[31566.24s -> 31567.04s]  German nose wipe.
[31567.04s -> 31567.44s]  Don't worry.
[31567.44s -> 31569.12s]  Don't apologize for giving me money.
[31572.62s -> 31574.54s]  Thanks for even considering.
[31578.44s -> 31578.76s]  Thank you.
[31579.40s -> 31582.83s]  I really appreciate it.
[31588.76s -> 31589.08s]  Thank you.
[31589.08s -> 31589.40s]  Thank you.
[31589.40s -> 31589.72s]  Thank you.
[31592.01s -> 31593.93s]  Do not say sorry.
[31598.22s -> 31599.26s]  Sorry for the cash.
[31602.46s -> 31602.94s]  Peter.
[31602.94s -> 31603.98s]  Welcome back, Peter.
[31603.98s -> 31606.14s]  P337R, thanks for the 20 bucks, Peter.
[31606.86s -> 31609.10s]  Congrats on the baby.
[31609.10s -> 31609.90s]  Thank you.
[31609.90s -> 31613.24s]  Congrats on the baby.
[31614.84s -> 31616.28s]  Thank you for the $20 bill.
[31616.92s -> 31617.80s]  2,000 bits.
[31618.60s -> 31620.46s]  Thank you, Peter.
[31621.02s -> 31626.59s]  Good to see you.
[31626.59s -> 31627.23s]  The thrill.
[31627.23s -> 31628.11s]  Thanks for the five dollars.
[31628.11s -> 31628.43s]  The thrill.
[31628.43s -> 31630.67s]  German, I'm sorry I called you a dick bag last night.
[31630.67s -> 31632.83s]  It was a big boy word I learned at work recently.
[31633.47s -> 31636.19s]  I was tired and half asleep when I slung that at you.
[31636.19s -> 31638.99s]  In my defense, things were getting heated in regards to the concepts
[31638.99s -> 31640.27s]  and definitions of cheating.
[31640.83s -> 31642.11s]  Thanks for tonight's fun.
[31642.11s -> 31645.07s]  PS, whatever happened to exoskeleton bug millennium boy?
[31645.95s -> 31649.34s]  It's funny you mentioned exoskeleton bug millennium boy
[31649.34s -> 31652.64s]  because I will be seeing him very soon.
[31653.36s -> 31657.96s]  Still a friend?
[31657.96s -> 31659.00s]  Still kicking around?
[31661.52s -> 31662.72s]  On the next stream, no.
[31669.64s -> 31672.20s]  A lot of the people and a lot of the friends that I have
[31673.66s -> 31676.62s]  from, you know, before even I turned on a YouTube video.
[31677.50s -> 31680.06s]  No, there's still none.
[31680.06s -> 31680.94s]  I still talk to them.
[31680.94s -> 31682.30s]  I still hang out with them.
[31682.30s -> 31685.40s]  We still converse.
[31686.20s -> 31690.70s]  When is Minecraft VR on the next VR stream?
[31690.70s -> 31691.98s]  Which will be probably next week.
[31692.78s -> 31695.26s]  I will get that set up.
[31695.82s -> 31698.12s]  We'll do another like three or four games
[31698.12s -> 31701.16s]  and then during that VR session I want to also do mine show.
[31701.88s -> 31703.08s]  So we'll get that started too.
[31703.96s -> 31706.83s]  Just want to take a break from VR.
[31707.71s -> 31710.83s]  Can't just go pedal on the ground.
[31712.03s -> 31714.88s]  You just did it today and it's awesome.
[31714.88s -> 31715.92s]  I'm looking forward to it.
[31715.92s -> 31717.04s]  I played for at least an hour.
[31717.92s -> 31720.19s]  But thank you, the thrill.
[31721.15s -> 31722.03s]  Don't worry.
[31722.03s -> 31723.79s]  I know you guys are just fucking around.
[31726.04s -> 31727.56s]  I say a lot of dumb shit too.
[31727.56s -> 31729.00s]  And it's just me messing around as well.
[31729.72s -> 31732.46s]  Thank you Pigeon for the 250.
[31732.46s -> 31733.82s]  You know, if you go into the settings,
[31733.82s -> 31735.98s]  you can edit the limit of NPC Sims.
[31735.98s -> 31737.82s]  You get to parties with like a hundred people.
[31738.46s -> 31740.80s]  I was just wanting you to know that it was me
[31740.80s -> 31743.04s]  who suggested Sims for the first time.
[31743.04s -> 31744.96s]  And I was the one who caused this stream.
[31744.96s -> 31745.46s]  I did.
[31746.56s -> 31754.62s]  Every suggestion is great.
[31759.32s -> 31762.04s]  I'm grateful for a lot of the suggestions over the years.
[31762.92s -> 31764.04s]  Recommendations.
[31764.04s -> 31766.20s]  They've turned out to be amazing experiences.
[31766.84s -> 31772.86s]  But thank you for the 250.
[31772.86s -> 31773.36s]  Appreciate it.
[31775.26s -> 31776.30s]  Be where I live.
[31776.30s -> 31777.18s]  Thanks for the 250.
[31777.18s -> 31778.78s]  I hate when none of the original cast
[31778.78s -> 31780.14s]  is left when a series ends.
[31780.70s -> 31782.54s]  They always jump the shark with a baby
[31782.54s -> 31783.98s]  and then everyone leaves.
[31784.70s -> 31786.22s]  Can't wait for the spinoff.
[31786.22s -> 31788.06s]  I'm G'naught, a detective G'no.
[31798.08s -> 31799.36s]  There are a lot of subs today too.
[31799.92s -> 31803.95s]  Let's go ahead and start running them
[31803.95s -> 31808.22s]  so you can see all the subs.
[31808.22s -> 31808.94s]  Thank you everybody.
[31809.66s -> 31812.25s]  Much love to you all.
[31812.89s -> 31816.56s]  But thank you Be Where I Live.
[31818.30s -> 31819.26s]  And DubskiDude.
[31819.26s -> 31820.22s]  Thanks for the 250.
[31820.22s -> 31821.02s]  DubskiDude.
[31821.02s -> 31822.14s]  Don't know if this has been asked before,
[31822.14s -> 31823.10s]  but what are your chances?
[31823.66s -> 31825.10s]  What are the chances of an all-star
[31825.10s -> 31826.86s]  Jerma Rumble with all the old favorites?
[31827.58s -> 31829.02s]  Every Rumble adds new wrestlers
[31829.02s -> 31830.30s]  and I feel like we're drifting further
[31830.30s -> 31831.98s]  from what made the original Rumbles great.
[31832.62s -> 31833.42s]  If you considered it.
[31833.98s -> 31835.58s]  And the Jerma Trading Cards too.
[31836.38s -> 31838.72s]  Yeah, we actually talked about the Trading Card thing
[31839.60s -> 31840.96s]  like a week or two ago.
[31840.96s -> 31843.92s]  Just about how it was going to cost a ton of money.
[31844.72s -> 31847.28s]  And it needs to be something that I can reliably do
[31847.76s -> 31848.72s]  and be comfortable doing.
[31849.52s -> 31851.37s]  As to the Jerma Rumble stuff.
[31852.09s -> 31854.99s]  Yeah, it's just a different beast on Twitch
[31854.99s -> 31856.91s]  because how it used to be
[31857.95s -> 31860.99s]  is I would, especially 2k14.
[31860.99s -> 31862.51s]  A lot of things I think people don't realize
[31863.72s -> 31868.44s]  is in 2k14, I could make scenarios happen.
[31869.32s -> 31870.52s]  I could go in and edit.
[31871.08s -> 31874.28s]  And like for instance, when Demon Lord Zaraxos
[31874.28s -> 31876.12s]  in Jerma Rumble 3 goes into the ring,
[31876.12s -> 31878.43s]  that doesn't happen in the game.
[31879.64s -> 31882.76s]  I had to string all that together with editing
[31883.71s -> 31886.03s]  and different camera angles and stuff.
[31888.01s -> 31889.85s]  So it's not like, oh, why don't you just...
[31891.85s -> 31892.65s]  They're very different.
[31893.79s -> 31894.35s]  Really, yeah.
[31898.57s -> 31902.72s]  The new games that have come out since 2k14
[31903.52s -> 31905.84s]  got rid of a lot of the creative stuff.
[31906.40s -> 31911.20s]  You're not able to have somebody backstage
[31912.09s -> 31914.25s]  put in actors and have the characters
[31914.25s -> 31915.93s]  punch each other and throw each other through tables.
[31916.89s -> 31917.85s]  You can't do them anymore.
[31919.74s -> 31921.50s]  Now, one would say, why don't you just go back
[31921.50s -> 31922.38s]  and do 2k14?
[31922.38s -> 31923.34s]  We talked about that.
[31923.34s -> 31923.74s]  Why?
[31923.74s -> 31924.86s]  And here's another reason why.
[31925.50s -> 31928.14s]  I did everything I could do in 2k14.
[31928.78s -> 31931.02s]  Every little cut scene, every little story arc,
[31931.02s -> 31934.14s]  little cut scene edit that I could do, I did it
[31934.14s -> 31935.58s]  because there's only a finite amount of them.
[31937.64s -> 31939.00s]  One of the reasons why I even did
[31939.00s -> 31941.24s]  the Jerma Rumble live action is because
[31942.17s -> 31943.29s]  there was nothing else for me
[31943.29s -> 31945.61s]  to actually physically do in 2k14.
[31946.68s -> 31947.64s]  I couldn't do anything else.
[31948.28s -> 31950.76s]  So I was like, fuck it, I'll do it on my own.
[31952.38s -> 31954.46s]  I'll just hire people and make it.
[31959.26s -> 31963.79s]  But that's why they probably feel a little different now
[31963.79s -> 31967.79s]  because the tools that are in the new WWE games
[31967.79s -> 31968.91s]  are terrible.
[31969.47s -> 31973.07s]  They're just absolutely awful.
[31973.07s -> 31973.79s]  They're awful.
[31974.59s -> 31977.39s]  The only saving grace that these new WWE games have
[31978.86s -> 31980.78s]  are the import image feature.
[31980.78s -> 31983.58s]  And it's just a giant bandaid for not being able
[31983.58s -> 31989.71s]  to create characters that you want to create.
[31989.71s -> 31991.87s]  Now, I could go back to 2k14 just for the sake
[31991.87s -> 31993.71s]  of making better characters.
[31993.71s -> 31996.01s]  But I brought this up too.
[31996.97s -> 32001.37s]  Going back, that was a end of life PS3 game
[32002.09s -> 32003.93s]  that they didn't bring or didn't port anywhere.
[32005.52s -> 32009.04s]  They pushed the PS3 to the absolute limit.
[32009.96s -> 32012.28s]  And if you have more than a few characters,
[32013.74s -> 32015.58s]  making characters is hell.
[32016.38s -> 32018.86s]  There's so much slowdown, it lags.
[32018.86s -> 32020.62s]  The new games at least don't have that.
[32021.34s -> 32024.38s]  Once you get 5, 10, 12 layers on a character,
[32025.93s -> 32027.37s]  it's pain.
[32028.30s -> 32032.92s]  Even turning their bodies and looking at a different angle
[32032.92s -> 32035.56s]  drops the game down to like four frames a second.
[32041.16s -> 32043.00s]  The new ones now just crash in the middle of the match.
[32043.00s -> 32046.80s]  Yes, that's true.
[32046.80s -> 32048.32s]  But they've stripped a lot.
[32048.32s -> 32051.02s]  Is it still possible to remake old characters
[32051.02s -> 32052.62s]  in the new game and do it that way?
[32054.62s -> 32055.34s]  I probably could.
[32056.38s -> 32057.74s]  It wouldn't be that big of a deal,
[32057.74s -> 32059.10s]  especially if it was like an all-star thing.
[32064.04s -> 32067.48s]  I'm hoping that, and I've been saying this for
[32068.20s -> 32072.00s]  five straight years now, after 2k15,
[32072.80s -> 32076.64s]  man, okay, next year maybe they'll lighten up a little bit
[32076.64s -> 32079.28s]  and make the created characters a little less serious.
[32080.24s -> 32082.57s]  Oh, we're gonna get new creation sweet stuff.
[32082.57s -> 32083.53s]  Cool. Oh, what is it?
[32083.53s -> 32086.33s]  No, no, it's not anything interesting.
[32086.33s -> 32087.37s]  What about next year?
[32087.37s -> 32089.61s]  Nope. What about three years ago?
[32090.62s -> 32093.04s]  Going forward four years now?
[32093.04s -> 32095.04s]  Nope.
[32095.04s -> 32097.92s]  They want that game to be taken as a serious wrestling simulation
[32097.92s -> 32102.09s]  and not as a fun experience.
[32102.65s -> 32104.62s]  They want that to be a fighting game.
[32107.18s -> 32107.98s]  Strangely enough.
[32108.54s -> 32115.20s]  So that leaves me in a weird position to making characters and
[32116.08s -> 32118.32s]  God, I wish this was 2k14.
[32118.32s -> 32120.43s]  So instead of complaining about it all the time,
[32120.43s -> 32121.95s]  which I still do.
[32121.95s -> 32124.08s]  How many times do you hear me complain about the new games?
[32128.67s -> 32132.59s]  It's just not worth going back and dealing with old technology.
[32136.56s -> 32138.00s]  Very long-winded response, but
[32139.96s -> 32141.72s]  doing like an all-star thing would be pretty fun.
[32145.28s -> 32146.56s]  What about other wrestling games?
[32146.56s -> 32147.36s]  There really aren't any.
[32149.00s -> 32151.16s]  The 2k wrestling games are the only ones that
[32152.38s -> 32153.90s]  have really any.
[32154.70s -> 32158.57s]  I can't think of any other wrestling games that exist.
[32163.02s -> 32166.38s]  Unless you're talking about some of the 2d ones that are essentially flash games.
[32167.93s -> 32169.37s]  Yeah, that's the McDickey ones.
[32169.37s -> 32170.81s]  That's what I'm talking about.
[32171.37s -> 32172.33s]  Not McDickey.
[32173.13s -> 32173.77s]  And what's his name?
[32173.77s -> 32174.25s]  MDickey.
[32175.05s -> 32181.84s]  This whole caliber is kind of good.
[32181.84s -> 32183.28s]  You'd probably make some characters in that too.
[32183.28s -> 32184.00s]  Yeah, that's true.
[32184.64s -> 32188.30s]  But that's another, I guess, response for that.
[32189.02s -> 32191.95s]  Thank you to all the subs.
[32191.95s -> 32193.15s]  We had Jess, you got it.
[32193.15s -> 32194.27s]  Came in right at the end with 250.
[32194.27s -> 32197.07s]  This is an AI that creates faces.
[32197.95s -> 32200.35s]  Reload it to get a new face every time.
[32200.35s -> 32200.99s]  Have a good night.
[32200.99s -> 32201.95s]  I've actually seen this.
[32202.91s -> 32204.03s]  This person does not exist.
[32204.03s -> 32205.07s]  Yeah, it's ridiculous.
[32206.11s -> 32208.80s]  Is it weird that I don't believe this?
[32213.24s -> 32215.64s]  They could just say that these are AI faces
[32215.64s -> 32217.80s]  and they just upload the whole employee notebook.
[32219.40s -> 32220.44s]  How many people work at Google?
[32220.44s -> 32221.48s]  Like 4,000?
[32221.48s -> 32221.98s]  5,000?
[32222.68s -> 32233.29s]  But that's going to be it, guys.
[32233.29s -> 32234.25s]  Thank you everybody for watching.
[32235.05s -> 32236.28s]  Hope you had a good time.
[32238.14s -> 32239.10s]  I'll see you guys.
[32240.30s -> 32243.58s]  Uh, I definitely, I'm not going to be more than a day or two.
[32245.07s -> 32246.75s]  But doctor's appointment tomorrow.
[32246.75s -> 32249.55s]  I got some stuff to take care of and continue.
[32251.18s -> 32252.38s]  Stream, oh, stream legends.
[32252.38s -> 32252.94s]  Right, right, right.
[32252.94s -> 32254.14s]  I'll give you, I got to give you guys your gear.
[32254.70s -> 32259.64s]  Got gear to give you guys.
[32260.68s -> 32263.00s]  I've got to remember to do that.
[32267.60s -> 32268.32s]  See you guys soon.
[32268.32s -> 32270.96s]  I'll let you know on Twitter and on Discord and stuff what's going on.
[32270.96s -> 32272.70s]  Much love to you.
[32272.70s -> 32273.18s]  See you soon.
[32273.74s -> 32277.74s]  How do I get the gift?
[32277.74s -> 32282.96s]  Oh, here it is.
[32282.96s -> 32283.92s]  Here it comes.
[32283.92s -> 32285.04s]  Three, two, one.
[32287.60s -> 32288.10s]  Loot.
[32288.64s -> 32289.14s]  Hooray.
[32289.60s -> 32294.24s]  Take care.
[32294.78s -> 32331.07s]  See you soon.
