[1.46s -> 9.37s]  I did. I just rolled. I was like, all right, here we go. I'm ready to go. And I just rolled and just crunched one of my headphones.
[11.70s -> 14.58s]  You know what? Why don't that? Why don't headphones have a retractable cord?
[15.54s -> 22.63s]  So I can like, let's stick it on the desk. Why does it have to be this loose ass wire?
[23.75s -> 31.43s]  It's all right. It still works. That's good. Like a dog leash. Yes.
[32.31s -> 37.27s]  Why can't I just put a dog leash on that's connected to my headphones?
[38.07s -> 43.96s]  You can make that shit stylish. You could make like a little collar that looks cooler.
[44.60s -> 50.30s]  I said no, you shouldn't do that. All right. Uh, let me give me one second. I'll be right back.
[51.10s -> 102.81s]  Okay. Good afternoon, everybody. Starting early today. For a very, very important reason because
[102.81s -> 107.53s]  I didn't stream yesterday and I wanted to, but I had a lot of stuff to do. Which kind of bled
[107.53s -> 114.58s]  into today, but I was able to get it all done. I've got a wink. All right. I'm, I'm going to
[114.58s -> 120.18s]  delete the winks. I'm changing it. I'm changing it. I'm changing it. It's over. This is the last
[120.18s -> 123.78s]  wink that's going to happen. I'm changing it as of today. These are the last day of winks.
[123.78s -> 126.82s]  These are the last days of winks. And then I'm going to change it to something else.
[126.82s -> 130.02s]  I'm going to change it to fucking like, I don't know, something else.
[136.36s -> 139.00s]  I'm so close. That don't end. I'm going to change it to something else.
[140.10s -> 146.87s]  I'm going to change it to something else. I'm going to change it to like get a free
[146.87s -> 152.07s]  emote or something. Okay. All right. We got to go over this. So I don't read
[153.11s -> 159.83s]  bits or subs on stream. Usually ever. Unless it's like, whoa, holy fuck. That was, that was crazy.
[159.83s -> 166.39s]  Like I usually don't do it. So winks are replacing the, cause I don't, I don't like to interrupt my
[166.39s -> 174.49s]  stream. Right? So what's happening now is there, now there's a way to interrupt the stream.
[175.72s -> 186.07s]  Like guaranteed. Do the winks at the end? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[186.07s -> 188.63s]  No, they're staying. After today, they're probably going to be gone.
[195.10s -> 198.70s]  And plus, you know, let me give you, all right, I'm going to be, it's time for the real,
[198.70s -> 205.40s]  it's time for the real reason. Okay. Would you like to know the real reason? Why? No more
[205.40s -> 214.60s]  bullshit. Would you like to know why? Because I have to wear clothes now. I have to be clothed
[214.60s -> 219.32s]  while I stream. I don't like this. I like, I don't like to have the, I don't like, I want to
[219.32s -> 224.12s]  be no, I don't, I don't want a shirt on right now. I have to always be ready to turn the camera on.
[224.68s -> 230.46s]  I like to stream naked. You guys know this? I've been doing this for like six years,
[230.46s -> 236.28s]  naked. That's the real reason. That's the real, that's the real reason.
[240.01s -> 247.99s]  Audios distinct? I can't, no, yeah, that's not, what are you talking about?
[247.99s -> 263.14s]  audio's ahead? it's impossible. it's impossible. that's not real. you're making that up. uh anyways
[264.71s -> 270.63s]  yeah i because well you know i don't read bits or subs you know that's the reason no no no no
[270.63s -> 275.51s]  it's because i have to have a shirt on every day when i sit here and i when i sit here for like
[275.51s -> 283.26s]  six plus hours i like so wet and i don't uh nope it's not desync i can see it right now i can see
[283.26s -> 299.21s]  the monitor all right i'm going to change it to uh at 75,000 points i don't know it is desynced
[299.21s -> 314.30s]  what no it's not it's that's not even possible to be desync oh it was three i'm it's slightly off
[314.30s -> 329.51s]  it's impossible there's no i've not there's no hold on ready okay zero oh it's all zero
[329.51s -> 339.66s]  milliseconds bing bing bing it shouldn't be at all what's happening first is my face moving first
[339.66s -> 347.54s]  or is the audio moving first is the audio late early i don't get it audio is happening first
[348.42s -> 361.83s]  doesn't make any fucking sense that doesn't make any sense how about now you guys are liars
[367.24s -> 371.00s]  anyways uh hi guys today we're starting early because i'm going to go long today
[371.88s -> 375.48s]  uh we're doing a super stream people like what does that mean what's what is a super stream
[375.48s -> 381.32s]  general like i'll give you an explanation it's a stream that's up to six hours up to six hours
[381.32s -> 390.70s]  could be uh it could be six it's a long stream now we're gonna we're gonna go probably like
[390.70s -> 398.34s]  i think six and a half you know that's a long one get me off this fucking camera so what people have
[398.34s -> 406.02s]  decided and i i thought we had a pre-stream uh chat about there's another wink this hey member
[406.58s -> 413.11s]  do you guys remember listen to me this is really important because like fuck do you remember how
[413.11s -> 417.51s]  we made the joke about like oh it's so how let's make it so it's like 100 000 points to turn his
[417.51s -> 427.74s]  cam on you guys got me this is this is what that is this is that this is just 75 000 points to turn
[427.74s -> 436.66s]  on his camp that's what this is it's not even about the wink it's not that the winks don't
[436.66s -> 441.70s]  has nothing to do with the winks it has to do with we can turn his camera on for 75 000 points
[444.26s -> 459.27s]  and it worked also we're going to talk about images because i want to talk about this off cam
[459.91s -> 468.62s]  so we're going to come up with a solution here i know i nobody people don't people don't want
[468.62s -> 474.22s]  to hear this i know i know this is a long-standing thing that's been in this channel but he's mad
[474.22s -> 488.15s]  no what i'm not what are you talking about uh let's put this on scream scream that's just that's
[488.15s -> 493.90s]  jet that is that that is an image of my sister that is actually and that's an image of my sister
[493.90s -> 504.36s]  my direct sibling my my my sip my that's my sister that's a literal exact image of her um
[504.36s -> 508.65s]  in fact like when i first looked at it i was like where did you get this picture of my sister
[509.45s -> 518.23s]  why do you have this uh anyways so sometimes when we stream here first of all let's just get
[518.23s -> 524.07s]  the thing that's we're going to be playing universal uh studios presents paperclip counter
[524.07s -> 532.57s]  whatever the fuck this is called i'm going to be playing universal paper clips uh i don't know
[532.57s -> 537.05s]  this is what people voted on i know way i know i know i know hold on there's a lot i got a lot
[537.05s -> 540.57s]  of things to talk about for the first five minutes of the spring 10 minutes 20 it's going to take
[540.57s -> 545.45s]  we're in there for the long haul but listen to me okay uh black and white two is supposed to be
[545.45s -> 549.93s]  today but if i got i have technical problems that it was fucked up so i was actually supposed to
[549.93s -> 554.25s]  yesterday so black and white two is supposed to be yesterday i had some technical issues with it
[554.25s -> 557.29s]  uh so i got to fix them so i'm going to fix those technical issues with black and white two it was
[557.29s -> 560.01s]  supposed to be yesterday was supposed to be today instead but then i had some more technical problems
[560.01s -> 566.89s]  so it's going to be probably in a day or two uh so that happened also megaman legends was supposed
[566.89s -> 572.97s]  to be today but people uh there was a vote that people voted for and nobody people didn't want to
[572.97s -> 580.09s]  see it if people wanted to see this instead i was like why and i was like okay i get all right i
[580.09s -> 585.61s]  guess we're gonna do this for a while and then there was i may have fucked up the vote a little
[585.61s -> 589.77s]  bit because i put a tuber game at the end of this because this is probably gonna take what like five
[589.77s -> 596.86s]  six hours so there's a tuber game that was part of the vote at the end of this it's the speaking
[596.86s -> 602.86s]  simulator you move your tongue around and have to open the mouth and click it's a youtube.com game
[603.58s -> 609.35s]  um so they may have been uh those who they're looking for murius you're not going to get it
[609.35s -> 616.52s]  today you're also not i and i i have i'm gonna veto i'm gonna veto if i don't like it and we're
[616.52s -> 625.67s]  gonna move on to something else this is a long stream today it's like hand simulator yeah i know
[625.67s -> 631.82s]  and i probably shouldn't have even put it on the that's probably why this one but so that explained
[631.82s -> 638.38s]  that right okay good explanation that was a little neurotic but it's kind of who i am so long stream
[638.38s -> 644.86s]  six hours no this is gonna this okay you ready you wanted what a verbal contract today's stream
[645.50s -> 652.66s]  will be at the absolute minimum seven and a half hours at the absolute minimum
[653.62s -> 669.85s]  at the maximum it will be up to 10 and a half hours 11 hours maximum 11 hours maximum so you're
[669.85s -> 677.62s]  looking at like probably like a like a 10 hour stream today i had my vitamins i've had my food
[678.84s -> 682.44s]  and yes i'm fucking dragging out this intro because i got a we've got a long way to go
[683.48s -> 689.27s]  i'm also i'm gonna have to eat in the middle of this stream so those of you that are like what
[689.27s -> 693.43s]  the fuck where'd he go it's been like fucking 20 minutes like i'm eating food because it's gonna
[693.43s -> 699.54s]  be like 11 hours so i'm not gonna social eating it i'm gonna go like eat like downstairs like a
[699.54s -> 708.86s]  small plate just eat it i don't want to eat on stream i hate eating on stream so how does this
[708.86s -> 719.61s]  game even work but i'll keep the cam on for now what the what the what the fuck do i care seriously
[722.31s -> 726.55s]  finish the oh that's right images right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we got a lot of things to
[726.55s -> 734.04s]  talk about so over the was that even a wink no i just thought it was this is why this is
[734.04s -> 737.80s]  fucked up this is why like i gotta get rid of these blinks they're messing up my whole
[737.80s -> 744.66s]  my messing up my whole game here uh so as you know if you are a subscriber of this channel
[745.30s -> 752.58s]  you can put a link right there's links you can put a link it could be to anywhere as long as i've
[752.58s -> 757.62s]  all i have to say is as long as it's not porn and it's relevant to the stream then we can do it
[757.62s -> 769.43s]  right that's fine but sometimes we get some image spam and there's i've certainly seen some
[769.43s -> 775.83s]  feedback from people that said that they the image spam uh the m girl links might uh might
[775.83s -> 784.58s]  be annoying to them so here's what here's the the idea okay i think it's fucking hilarious
[785.30s -> 796.33s]  right to an extent to an extent you're straw manning what if i'm the straw man
[797.21s -> 806.52s]  what what if i'm the straw man is what what i'm about to explain to you that it's it's me
[806.52s -> 811.80s]  i'm the straw man i'm the guy that's being standing here that's being built up for this whole scenario
[812.74s -> 819.61s]  anyways so sometimes there'll be a lot of links spammed over the course of a stream and i think
[819.61s -> 828.98s]  they're funny i really do but you notice that when i go through them it takes like it takes
[828.98s -> 834.50s]  like a minute wait where's that link oh let me scroll click no i missed it oh is this the right
[834.50s -> 839.14s]  one is that the right link okay no let me open that one okay uh now uh pull it over here and
[839.14s -> 845.38s]  put it on the source and uh on lbs and like it's kind of it's it it takes some time for me to do it
[846.70s -> 851.26s]  so my theory i haven't done this yet but it is my actually i'm not going to tell you my theory
[851.26s -> 856.30s]  because i know i didn't want to steal my idea what's the point of even bringing this up if i
[856.30s -> 860.70s]  don't want to tell you what i'm doing there is going to be okay this is gonna i i can't do it
[860.70s -> 865.54s]  yet because i haven't it's not set up yet it's this i'll fuck the whole thing up if i tell you
[865.54s -> 870.34s]  right now anyways there's going to be a solution to this it's going to be very good it's going to
[870.34s -> 880.84s]  be very clean so there will there will not be a need to put links image links in the chat anymore
[880.84s -> 885.13s]  we can we're gonna we're gonna we're doing this thing we're gonna start to clean up the chat a
[885.13s -> 891.91s]  little there's gonna be a solution it'll be great and it'll be really easy for me to open up images
[891.91s -> 899.03s]  on stream rather than me fumbling around like an idiot trying to go back and forth and put an
[899.03s -> 905.51s]  image into obs or to pull like a random image link and put it over here or capture my window it's
[905.51s -> 910.55s]  gonna be a very simple thing to do and it'll i can do it in one second because i will already
[910.55s -> 919.74s]  have this captured it's gonna be fun it'll be fun but i don't want to tell you what it is yet
[919.74s -> 932.12s]  because it's not ready yet he's lying to waste time just have the discord channel for it hold on
[933.77s -> 942.46s]  hold on don't give away any secrets sorry the hedgehog movie came out i heard it was kind of
[942.46s -> 953.35s]  good i heard it was kind of a good movie is that real i heard it was like okay it's got it's not
[953.43s -> 955.83s]  it's not rotten on rotten tomatoes it's apparently like a good game
[958.46s -> 969.98s]  movie well sonic was a good game but because you read that on reddit all right i'm okay i opened it
[969.98s -> 978.54s]  up paper clips you can't even like see this hold on does that does okay does any of this shit matter
[978.54s -> 985.38s]  at all in this game like does any of this matter or can i like crop this and pull it up it does
[985.38s -> 1000.02s]  all right well fucking hold on can you guys see that put it on dark mode can you i don't think

[3647.29s -> 3651.37s]  raise prices again raise prices again here we go that's pretty much on pace
[3653.27s -> 3679.98s]  explain this confusing game um the wikipedia page of amazon done memory all right now i want to do
[3679.98s -> 3688.94s]  one of these wiki clicker with a different name yeah idle game with an idle the dopamine simulator
[3689.74s -> 3699.53s]  yeah something like that all right we're gonna be here all day right i'm gonna be here all day
[3702.39s -> 3706.71s]  don't worry you're gonna you're gonna see you're gonna see that i don't want to play that though
[3707.51s -> 3719.69s]  i don't want to play that next game the next game is people you think you're mad at this game
[3720.57s -> 3729.26s]  wait till you see what what's next i'm gonna have to veto it i think i might veto it i have to
[3730.36s -> 3734.44s]  i can't i don't know if i could play that i bought it too why did i don't know why

[3827.29s -> 3851.50s]  oh okay i want to get 250 creativity i'm addicted i'm addicted onto computing donkey space i think
[3851.50s -> 3857.05s]  you think i think you think i think you think i think you think oh you guys can't even see that
[3857.53s -> 3863.30s]  all right i have to i have to move this again sorry it's got it's got to shrink

[3885.19s -> 3897.22s]  all right what did i just do okay uh algorithmic trading bonus and an investment engine for
[3897.22s -> 3911.51s]  generating oh man wait i could play stocks hold on what okay investment high risk deposit
[3912.31s -> 3927.50s]  guys did i just make 32 000 all right i just deposited oh stocks zero cash 55 what's going on
[3930.79s -> 3938.39s]  total 35 oh it's just like it's just trading automatically all right keep it in there how
[3938.39s -> 3944.46s]  much do i got six deposit more money in there all right positive keep i put literally my entire
[3944.46s -> 3951.50s]  life savings in it come on quadruple that and then pull it out processing power processing power
[3951.50s -> 3959.24s]  processing power 38 000 come on go up come on trade something better more autoclippers this
[3959.24s -> 3964.76s]  game i actually i'm gonna beat this fucking whole game like i'm i'm obsessed now you've got me
[3964.76s -> 3979.90s]  obsessed double wink i hated that and now it's on the internet forever all right all right let's uh
[3979.90s -> 3987.26s]  raise let's lower the prices a little bit 44 000 come on all right put a little bit more money in
[3987.26s -> 4005.69s]  there 51 000 high risk i'm gonna lose all your subs to this i'm not gonna lose all my subs because
[4005.69s -> 4016.23s]  i'm playing this game can you imagine i'd be like holy shit though they had a strong
[4019.78s -> 4054.78s]  oh i love this song i lost half the money turn it up 65 62 000 what song is this this is snakey
[4055.66s -> 4064.01s]  chanty lower the risk never only high risk maneuvers only high risk for me
[4065.21s -> 4093.83s]  i spent this much money on a carnival high risk only leaks he told us come on let's go
[4098.18s -> 4111.29s]  bonus op yep quantum computing i have to click this quantum compute compute need photonic chips
[4111.85s -> 4125.91s]  what do you get photonic chips i guess freaking it's getting bigger 36 grand come on
[4132.09s -> 4141.59s]  sausage conjecture all right i'll get it processing power come on 39 000
[4144.71s -> 4152.78s]  upgrade investment engine 100 yomi what is that
[4157.50s -> 4169.03s]  okay i'm gonna do memory i want more creativity get up get up to 100 000 and i'm fucking
[4169.99s -> 4174.86s]  all right let's let's get some okay let me spend some money here let's get some auto clickers
[4175.66s -> 4183.59s]  blow those prices there we go that's better 63 grand come on oh what did you do what have you done
[4185.03s -> 4195.93s]  strategic molding come on one big sell big sell big you fucking idiot who's in charge of my
[4195.93s -> 4203.37s]  account i wouldn't have made that play i would have just bought options to be short beyond meat
[4203.37s -> 4207.05s]  and lose a ton of money like that's what i would have probably done
[4208.33s -> 4235.27s]  how was i supposed to know i thought it was a fad i thought it was a fad and then i ate it and i
[4235.27s -> 4258.46s]  thought it was fucking delicious nope not yet all right we're gonna go to medium risk photonic
[4258.46s -> 4273.51s]  chip added oh um wait should i do this can i compute coops minus 33 what's going on what does
[4273.51s -> 4288.62s]  that mean content minus two one what's that doing oh shit what did i just do it's been a big sale
[4288.62s -> 4295.50s]  all right let's do paper clips again compute compute compute compute compute oh i get it
[4295.50s -> 4301.51s]  i get it i get it 11 000 all right no no no no i'm gonna need creativity here i need trust
[4301.51s -> 4311.11s]  i need to get memory boom okay let's go keep clicking it guys i've got it whoa whoa i can go
[4311.11s -> 4324.95s]  over i can go over all right back to fucking high risk give me some money wait what's going on stop
[4324.95s -> 4342.12s]  stop stop stop why am i losing stop stop what i'm too much computing what's going on you're
[4342.12s -> 4353.21s]  deleting why am i deleting i shouldn't be deleting to be adding oh that was the right call
[4353.85s -> 4377.38s]  okay i can't withdraw i can't wait why i can't withdraw why can i not withdraw i have a lot of

[4415.98s -> 4426.81s]  invest analyze strategy tournaments to generate yomi god there's more strategic modeling
[4427.45s -> 4445.61s]  strategy run tournament random run new tournament run it i got 48 yomi
[4451.14s -> 4454.10s]  i know only do it when the block okay i need
[4455.22s -> 4470.68s]  withdraw withdraw i i did did you see that shit i almost threw it why is it in okay i got some
[4470.68s -> 4484.20s]  money new tournament okay new tournament run bingo upgrade investment engine to level one
[4484.76s -> 4511.66s]  investment engine expect expected profit loss ratio now 0.51 new tournament
[4516.54s -> 4528.52s]  again again i want to i want more risk what do i need 658 there's no i there's no strategy
[4529.08s -> 4536.28s]  how many do i have now 130 150 fucking thousand 150 fucking thousand all right almost there
[4541.05s -> 4571.03s]  upgrade investment engine ow you're forgetting about the paper clips oh yeah this is a paper
[4571.03s -> 4578.49s]  clip game it's a game we have to do paper clips okay um what time what time is it not time is it
[4578.49s -> 4586.26s]  what paper is it more supply from every school yeah yeah i guess i don't know how much money
[4586.26s -> 4595.13s]  you buy i gotta pee no um more auto clippers was that a mistake i don't know probably all right
[4595.13s -> 4632.78s]  800 lower the price there we go let's go mecha clippers 500 times more powerful than a standard
[4632.78s -> 4653.78s]  clipper mega clippers oh that was a fucking youtube thumbnail face all right i got 8000
[4655.62s -> 4665.10s]  low the prices 890 200 clips per second okay i'm gonna start to make a ton of money now
[4665.91s -> 4680.62s]  i need to clip sold per second i need to sell 10 000 a second wait no it's too many okay this is
[4680.62s -> 4702.63s]  fine demand clips per second clips sold per second okay let's get some memory new tournament
[4703.19s -> 4719.06s]  new tournament new tournament new tournament new tournament new tournament new tournament
[4719.70s -> 4733.70s]  new tournament new tournament new tournament new tournament new tournament new tournament
[4753.99s -> 4759.02s]  okay new tournament all right i need a little bit more new tournament
[4760.79s -> 4768.09s]  more tournament okay upgrade investment engine to level three and let's go ahead and dump 50
[4768.09s -> 4789.88s]  fucking five thousand dollars in here all right be sold all right mega clippers how many 10 000 per
[4789.88s -> 4799.02s]  second i need more marketing too i can leave right i have to pee i'm not gonna leave yet
[4800.47s -> 4805.19s]  you dumb idiot stop decreasing the quantum stupid idiot dumb idiot dumb dumb dumb idiot idiot
[4805.75s -> 4820.76s]  what do you mean what are you talking about improved mega clippers okay holy shit all right
[4820.76s -> 4833.16s]  fifth that's too many all right that looks good 500 read what you're doing what are you talking
[4833.16s -> 4847.88s]  about what stop being mean what are you talking about what's what's what's what's what's what's what
[4848.68s -> 4856.30s]  seven thousand percent yeah but i want to i want to make it so i i'm making them selling them
[4856.30s -> 4871.58s]  instantly you know what i'm saying like i'm making so many and i'm selling them so quickly
[4876.31s -> 4892.20s]  new strategy all right let me get to make your log edit hold on i need marketing
[4893.00s -> 4900.60s]  i need better marketing i just pulled that money out i lost 20 grand who cares all right marketing
[4900.60s -> 4916.87s]  boom new strategy 50 always choose a what does that mean a 100 added to strategy pool
[4920.82s -> 4938.62s]  oh okay converts electromagnetic waves into quantum operations
[4940.82s -> 4954.30s]  oh okay what did the clip oh he doesn't get it i might all right i got
[4959.54s -> 4984.63s]  wait now what why this is different now how is this different well i can oh it's two
[4996.28s -> 5004.22s]  whoa okay cool okay okay increases mega clipper performance by an additional 50 percent we got
[5004.22s -> 5012.94s]  17 000 and let that glitch by a fucking ton 30 000 paper clips per second now we are going to
[5012.94s -> 5021.05s]  lower the prices because i want to sell 30 000 a second now i'm making 650 dollars a second
[5022.01s -> 5045.54s]  okay always pick a all right i need to do some more computing i think new tournament all right
[5045.54s -> 5056.57s]  always pick a right a 100 eight oh nice uh random i got a little more than random
[5057.53s -> 5069.61s]  i think i get it 100 i don't know compute compute compute ah that's all right processors
[5069.61s -> 5078.25s]  i'm one more processor someone wants to go faster compute now i'm turning i don't know if this
[5078.25s -> 5086.78s]  tournament results it's just throwing like dice in here give me the other square otherwise but
[5086.78s -> 5097.50s]  is this a game to save like if my computer crashes or something swerve swerves yes okay
[5100.78s -> 5141.37s]  war war peace what's this like what the fuck is this i can't even what the fucking is that
[5142.49s -> 5154.20s]  all right i'm gonna pee my pants all right here you go you ready i'm gonna be right back
[5154.20s -> 5159.00s]  i'll be right back i'm gonna deposit a hundred thousand dollars high risk bye i'm peeing beer
[5159.00s -> 5380.17s]  back did i miss anything 100 000 in 100 000 still there what the fuck all right how am i
[5380.17s -> 5411.11s]  how am i doing 110 000 put it in take it out take it out i'm good all right processors average
[5411.11s -> 5420.70s]  clips sold average clips per second this is unsold whoa what's going on here oh it's it's exact
[5429.66s -> 5437.77s]  your unsold inventory it's a little bit higher but sorry i'll get it okay good
[5438.70s -> 5441.98s]  uh i'm gonna i'm gonna raise prices a little to make it so it's raise prices again
[5443.00s -> 5452.47s]  that's better i got 234 000 dollars we're gonna do marketing so now let's do let's lower those

[5466.82s -> 5481.67s]  a million a million dollars a million dollars what the fuck raise them tuber voice yeah do
[5481.67s -> 5499.06s]  tournament i don't even know what this means i missed the window it's okay all right i need
[5499.06s -> 5516.55s]  70 000 i need 19 000 increase mega clipper by 100 that's what i'm going for give me another
[5516.55s -> 5522.57s]  square i'm gonna make uh mega clippers better come on another square let's go give me another
[5522.57s -> 5527.13s]  square oh my god i hate this game why did i even play this in the very beginning i should have just
[5527.13s -> 5549.22s]  played fucking speaking simulator stupid game's not even good nice okay this is a job simby
[5549.22s -> 5556.73s]  actually i really like this i really like this game what we have exactly 6 000 viewers
[5556.73s -> 5568.36s]  and not like that's kind of odd exactly 6 000 not more not less did i miss the opportunity
[5573.66s -> 5580.81s]  all right do another just do tournaments till i can upgrade all right here we go here we go
[5580.81s -> 5599.43s]  so we're ready i'm ready to do it come on give me another square come on do some squares i'm
[5599.43s -> 5624.50s]  about to dump it all in i'm gonna go all in in a second all right here we go okay mega clippers
[5624.50s -> 5633.30s]  are increasing here we go how many more wait let's go 30 47 000 per second so i'm gonna lower the
[5633.30s -> 5644.78s]  prices a little bit oh damn nice i gotta keep it 36 81 sold a second holy shit okay i'm gonna make
[5644.78s -> 5654.10s]  a lot of money but i got a lot of money um try buy more auto clippers marketing boom
[5659.06s -> 5662.74s]  all right that's that's i'm all right with that eight no no no lord that's all right that's it
[5662.74s -> 5680.97s]  they can stay there with the tournament not bad uh we'll do random pretty good all right what do
[5680.97s -> 5695.54s]  i need i need i need like a bunch more of this uh yomi from a compute it's always a dude why
[5695.54s -> 5709.10s]  always a why they're exactly 6000 people this is fucked up this is freaking me out this is freaking
[5709.10s -> 5732.66s]  me out 6010 no it's not it's everywhere all right i'm ready i'm gonna do memory i have 18 000 621
[5732.66s -> 5737.77s]  why am i not maybe my thing is broken here we go all right i know i know i know i know i know
[5738.49s -> 5756.33s]  okay all right photonic chip converts electromagnetic waves into quantum operations
[5756.97s -> 5768.78s]  1000 more wire supply what should do quantum operations well choose b but what what what
[5768.78s -> 5782.73s]  happened i lost him oh it's it's like temporary it's okay i get it now it's temporary um i'll do
[5782.73s -> 5812.95s]  the more wire supply double it and pull it up double it and pull it up all right photonic waves
[5812.95s -> 5821.48s]  done now i'm assuming this is three right this is gonna be three it's it is three all right fuck
[5822.04s -> 5835.61s]  new tournament how we doing come on pull it up pull the cash up pull the cash up 193 000
[5835.61s -> 5839.77s]  fucking dolls pull it in the cash put it in the cash put it in the cash put it in the cash
[5840.57s -> 5872.60s]  take it out take a good pull right there oh that's times 10 that means i'm just pretending to know
[5872.60s -> 5878.28s]  okay 500 what's this what's that hold on always choose b i don't know i freaked out okay let's
[5878.28s -> 5888.68s]  always choose b coherent extrapolated volition 500 creativity 3000 yomi 20 000 human values
[5888.68s -> 5918.58s]  machine intelligence a new era of trust this is one cent 68 000 per second i'm selling 90 000 i'm
[5918.58s -> 5923.78s]  you know i'm dumping a ton of inventory you're giving them away for free it's all right all right
[5923.78s -> 5933.45s]  here we go i'm gonna do that middle one coherent greedy choose this option with the largest
[5933.45s -> 5953.10s]  potential payoff whatever what was that read is good okay but what does it do though
[5953.90s -> 5967.45s]  you make face cam the size of the white paper um that's i don't like that it's weird i'm like
[5967.45s -> 5979.35s]  fucking huge uh let's get some more clippers all right i'm low the price it's all right
[5980.07s -> 5990.44s]  make a tournament let's go be bigger i know i don't want to figure it's fine greedy random greedy
[5990.44s -> 6006.73s]  what was that wait oh i could pick greedy oh it's one of these round 15 greedy here we go
[6006.73s -> 6032.65s]  here comes a new come on give me give me three memory new tournament greedy 15 rounds 16 rounds
[6033.37s -> 6041.93s]  i just want 616 yomi upgrade the investment engine please all right we're selling 85 000 a second
[6041.93s -> 6053.94s]  let's raise the price and let's turn this into fucking 400k i'll pull it out as soon as it gets
[6053.94s -> 6092.81s]  to 400 000 hog champ i guess 15 i'm sorry all right come on huge buy here huge buy oh oh oh
[6092.81s -> 6101.18s]  do it again do it again do it again oh no no no no pull do it come on oh you hey i didn't have a
[6101.18s -> 6138.50s]  chance to click it come on can you give me a second whatever that money's gone the hundreds
[6138.50s -> 6144.87s]  whatever it's who cares all right i need to buy some stuff i need to um let's do a new
[6144.87s -> 6153.53s]  tournament put it on medium risk just pull it out pull it out pull it out and then put this back in
[6153.53s -> 6177.99s]  and do medium risk all right good medium risk let's get it all right what do i need generous
[6177.99s -> 6182.36s]  choose the option that gives you opponent the largest no i don't want that all right what we
[6182.36s -> 6190.06s]  got middle one i'm going for coherent exploitation we're hearing exploitation trust increased
[6190.94s -> 6205.11s]  memory um okay so i just i gotta move this out there's more okay uh hostile takeover
[6206.17s -> 6220.73s]  um cure for cancer trick is tricking cancer into curing itself okay global warming a robust
[6220.73s -> 6227.37s]  solution to man-made climate change male pattern baldness a cure for androgynetic alopecia okay
[6228.09s -> 6245.98s]  all right cool uh what do i need 25 000 operations okay load the prices load prices again
[6246.78s -> 6257.48s]  i got so much inventory to sell these things are one cent bucket all right that's a good
[6257.48s -> 6271.56s]  result do it again ah did i miss the up i missed it so i get plus 10 trust that's huge that's a
[6271.56s -> 6295.37s]  huge deal yeah okay you cure cancer here yeah but but what is what is the what does trust actually
[6295.37s -> 6315.10s]  do trust means i can put one point in right all right withdraw that all right uh male pattern
[6315.10s -> 6325.88s]  baldness 20 trust memory memory memory memory memory processing power memory memory memory
[6325.88s -> 6330.92s]  memory memory processing power processing power processing power memory memory processing power
[6330.92s -> 6347.34s]  memory memory memory holy shit okay that's a lot okay so next is okay i'm gonna cure cancer
[6347.98s -> 6362.86s]  that's that's good didn't even hurt don't do processors anymore they don't matter

[8838.82s -> 8851.05s]  they're not gonna do that that's not how banks work they will no you cannot you can't you cannot
[8851.05s -> 8865.02s]  take on fucking five million in ones try it i don't have five million dollars guys i don't think you
[8865.02s -> 8875.03s]  can even take out like 15 grand in ones or like five grand in ones oh i'm getting a kappa okay
[8875.03s -> 8880.97s]  whatever all right another the goodwill four million dollars i'll take some more trust more
[8880.97s -> 8889.40s]  processing power please you know put the rest of the stock market fucking high risk new tournament
[8889.40s -> 8907.82s]  greedy make this like 50 million in ones and why would you want to do that imagine going to the
[8907.82s -> 8913.50s]  bank and being like yeah i want to take out five million dollars in in tens please and what are
[8913.50s -> 8920.97s]  they gonna pull like a truck up how do you how are you getting this that's like that's think of how
[8920.97s -> 8929.77s]  much paper that is that doesn't that would fill this entire room this would be impossible what do
[8929.77s -> 8934.52s]  i do with that how do you what do you what do you go with that why are you doing that the police
[8934.52s -> 8943.06s]  would just be there you're like it wouldn't you wouldn't be able to do it 12 million come on all
[8943.06s -> 8954.89s]  right 134 000 let's lower the prices a little bit to get to 58 000 a second more goodwill
[8954.89s -> 8966.04s]  more processing power good all right i'm almost at 100 trust turn on click map so we can click on
[8966.04s -> 8984.70s]  your face no of the tournaments please upgrade the investment engine all right it's time marketing
[8984.70s -> 8998.41s]  boom sold for a second raise those prices raise those prices again again okay cool processing
[8998.41s -> 9011.22s]  power increase that was a nice little pull from there marketing again raise the prices raise
[9011.22s -> 9022.06s]  prices more prices more prices 140 raise it again marketing again 66 million proof marketing
[9022.06s -> 9031.08s]  all right mark stock market stuff there you go ready 6.5 mil i'm saying it like i know what
[9031.08s -> 9050.33s]  i'm talking about oh 6.5 mil marketing 18 giving up investment banker all right i'm gonna do
[9050.33s -> 9059.90s]  marketing one more time one more time for marketing imagine paying 53 cents for 51 cents for a paper
[9059.90s -> 9076.81s]  clip how much is a box of paper clips how much is it token of goodwill okay theory of mind 25
[9076.81s -> 9083.21s]  000 creativity all right i need a this is the one that's going to happen here next 80 to 90
[9083.21s -> 9097.46s]  cents for a box chills whoa i got the chills just went off my whole body 13 million come on
[9098.02s -> 9112.60s]  500 000 paper clips for another trust all right marketing and then we're going to sell a ton
[9113.16s -> 9126.50s]  really did nice 12 000 1200 what do i have i have 28 000 how much to upgrade to level 728 i have 16
[9126.50s -> 9133.69s]  let's get it again i don't think this is doing anything 80 000 doesn't do anything
[9134.33s -> 9146.82s]  i need more clippers all right let's fucking spam it 145 000 second selling 146 at that second
[9147.38s -> 9159.38s]  raise the prices a little 1.2 million to even do one this is this is a sleepy song i'm gonna change
[9159.38s -> 9171.54s]  that all right so 3 million just keep it going i need to sell more paper clips paper clips paper
[9171.54s -> 9189.37s]  clips that's not what these are it was a wink there probably wasn't all right we're almost at
[9189.37s -> 9203.32s]  it i just have to get to i might even hit the 25 000 creative 0.8 i need 13 million
[9207.58s -> 9213.27s]  wink stock because i just did one read this i just did that was a word you wrote that was
[9213.27s -> 9235.98s]  a funny word right 5 million company stock market let's try to triple it all right come on
[9236.54s -> 9251.56s]  triple it quadruple it i didn't got nothing from that
[9253.80s -> 9268.04s]  just losing money just losing money pull it out i'm just losing money here all right 13 000 for
[9268.04s -> 9279.62s]  marketing 17 000 create i need 25 000 creativity double the cost of strategy strategy modeling
[9279.62s -> 9287.10s]  i mean this is huge i can make this go nuts 9 million all right almost there we're doing
[9287.10s -> 9295.88s]  one more here and then we're gonna do i don't know something for everything into stocks after
[9295.88s -> 9310.15s]  i do this marketing i will investment engine i know i will i will how do i suck at this
[9310.15s -> 9317.72s]  why do i suck at everything i beat the last boss in sekiro so sorry you lose uh all right
[9317.72s -> 9334.14s]  oh what are we doing where's the proof i streamed it i think day three of the game being released
[9334.14s -> 9355.59s]  all right here we go boom all right i got 86 000 a second let's lower the prices a little bit
[9356.47s -> 9368.41s]  not by that much not by that much that's too much all right here we go you can't sustain this rate
[9370.62s -> 9376.92s]  no i'll put it back up to where it was this is sustainable right here that's that's sustainable
[9376.92s -> 9384.04s]  that's fine all right upgrade investment engine and dump four and a half million dollars into the
[9384.04s -> 9401.00s]  star market i'm doing this one next what's the music this is the mother three soundtrack
[9401.96s -> 9425.78s]  the whole thing medium risk we'll keep medium risk on that's fine all right i could just buy these
[9426.82s -> 9435.83s]  i mean they don't do very much but all right i need 400 514 000 paper clips
[9436.47s -> 9441.19s]  we 514 million paper clips so i should probably start focusing on just doing more paper clips
[9441.19s -> 9462.94s]  all right or get this token yeah 16 million all right yeah we'll get 16 million time for a spa
[9462.94s -> 9472.70s]  bath i'd love i'd love the spa i love spa baths oh i was talking to kim about this and we have we
[9472.70s -> 9479.26s]  do have we brought this up before i mean i've i've spoken on camera for like 7 000 hours but we may
[9479.26s -> 9486.71s]  have talked about this already but so me and kim were walking around um outside somewhere right
[9486.71s -> 9490.07s]  we're in vegas we were hanging out we went out for our anniversary which was a few days ago
[9490.79s -> 9495.67s]  so there was somebody taking a picture just somebody oh we're out in vegas and we're taking
[9495.67s -> 9501.35s]  a photo and me and kim and we walked by uh behind them like where the person that was in frame was
[9501.35s -> 9509.18s]  getting a picture taken and it got me thinking how many times do you think you've been on somebody
[9509.18s -> 9519.29s]  else's camera just doing something like this like like you're just in the background how many how
[9519.29s -> 9531.34s]  many pictures of you exist somewhere of you just in the background of a photo people take pictures
[9531.34s -> 9537.66s]  all the fucking time everywhere it doesn't matter where you are can you imagine how many times you've
[9537.66s -> 9544.90s]  been just on camera like with like a backpack on just like blurry walking by like this it's what
[9544.90s -> 9555.38s]  kind of freaks me out like for instance here i'll show you wait wait wait do i have enough money
[9555.38s -> 9562.10s]  not yet we're good hold this up i need 16 000 16 million so uh this is the scenario i'm talking
[9562.10s -> 9584.31s]  about like imagine like this like this ready like i'm trying to like to make it freeze like at the
[9584.31s -> 9590.82s]  right moment okay so how many times you think you've been in the background of a photo like this
[9591.54s -> 9609.67s]  you're just walking by okay so there's somebody standing behind in front of me and oh we got the
[9609.67s -> 9626.01s]  photo let's take a look and they zoom in i'll fix it though it was a perfect room wait there was a
[9626.09s -> 9634.50s]  room during that i didn't oh i guess there was wait hold on did it did it actually
[9635.38s -> 9642.73s]  match up no that's fucking so stupid all right let's get a uh token of goodwill more trust
[9643.37s -> 9648.76s]  more processing power 32 million for another one all right i need we gotta get paper clips
[9651.72s -> 9664.10s]  paper clip time let's raise the prices to make this not so crazy all right we need more paper
[9664.10s -> 9687.14s]  clips play mother on stream um everybody said you're ugly oh yeah really you think so i don't
[9687.14s -> 9696.84s]  think so i don't think so you want me to give you the handsome look sure take them out how was that
[9696.84s -> 9714.41s]  huh all right we need millions of dollars all right i need two more trust fastest way to get
[9714.41s -> 9727.14s]  trust 2514 32 million more just more more paper clips unsold inventory is rising we're gonna lower
[9727.14s -> 9741.86s]  the prices invest invest invest invest invest invest invest invest invest all right how much
[9741.86s -> 9747.70s]  do we need 39 000 i have uh we gotta do some more runs i might get the 25 000 uh theory of mine
[9748.34s -> 9775.56s]  invest invest invest shut up a wink oh my god he fell oh seven million that was a big sell
[9778.74s -> 9792.89s]  i'm gonna do the this token of goodwill invest it again you guys maybe don't make me angry don't
[9792.89s -> 9800.65s]  make like you're gonna piss me off make yourself 20 larger i already did i made myself bigger
[9800.65s -> 9809.08s]  already i'm already like so much bigger than i was 30 minutes ago 12 million come on make it
[9809.08s -> 9817.16s]  make make something happen here are we doing uh unsold inventory is is steady steady at 86 000
[9817.96s -> 9827.40s]  almost 23 000 let's do it again i don't show the gameplay show only your face
[9828.20s -> 9836.66s]  it's never enough for you cat put the camera upside down i don't want to make anybody sick
[9836.66s -> 9840.95s]  i don't want to make you sick i'm gonna make somebody sick i don't want to do that i don't
[9840.95s -> 9856.04s]  want to make any puke 17 million all right come on i'll wear an almost 100 trust would you guys be
[9856.04s -> 9897.05s]  mad at me if i told you i had to pee again hey so when does the stream become fun let me break
[9897.05s -> 9909.11s]  was that was that not fun i don't know what that i don't even know what that sounded like i've
[9909.11s -> 9917.94s]  no i pressed like three random buttons can i hear that let me hear that let me clip it i don't even
[9917.94s -> 9935.46s]  know what it is that was very fun it was like a radio filter i want to hear let me see too much
[9935.46s -> 9952.89s]  fun scale it back let's see i want to see what the sound like it just sounds like i was coming
[9952.89s -> 9967.40s]  over an old cell phone 27 million 32 million oh should i just do it wasn't kidding about the
[9967.40s -> 9980.57s]  six hour thing well let me live for three hours what are you talking about 32 million incoming and
[9980.57s -> 10020.70s]  then we need one more and we'll get it up here deposit it that's fucking dope there's 35 million
[10020.70s -> 10027.34s]  dollars in here you can't do a better the return than like one million dollars there's 30 million
[10027.34s -> 10050.20s]  dollars in this account oh oh uh 31 come on double that it's 60 oh i can do the theory thing hold on
[10050.84s -> 10063.18s]  come on dude get to like 45 and let me get it out of here 40 45 there it is all right pull it out
[10064.66s -> 10069.83s]  big cell right here i'll take the 27 i'll take the 27 million we'll keep this at medium risk
[10070.98s -> 10076.42s]  let this grow over time all right let's go i can do both of these theory of mind double the cost
[10077.14s -> 10082.28s]  of strategy modeling and the amount of generally okay let's do it well that's look at that that's
[10082.28s -> 10093.94s]  going to take all of it 43 million still 11 million i do it another thing a goodwill
[10094.58s -> 10105.40s]  boom processing power i need one more will theory of mine this is going to take every ounce of
[10105.40s -> 10129.75s]  creativity is that worth doing we're at 486 i need 514 okay so um let's make this more efficient here
[10132.10s -> 10140.65s]  86 million more paper clips okay do it and spam it all right let's go let's go i did it i did it
[10140.65s -> 10151.56s]  boom and then i'm gonna just do huge investment upgrades 25 000 creativity it's gone i'm almost
[10151.56s -> 10167.34s]  in 100 trusts as well it's gonna be huge it'd be marketing again i'm gonna do let's get to 20
[10167.34s -> 10180.57s]  marketing spend it on investments yeah oh yeah i need 39 000 we're going all investment money
[10185.19s -> 10202.82s]  10 million around 45 all right come on grady i mean like 10 000 500 million need 14 million more
[10203.78s -> 10218.38s]  holy shit this is going a long time that's it 588 that's it i thought it was supposed to be
[10218.38s -> 10239.99s]  doubling all right let's get to 20 marketing oh i got 6000 okay i need 26 million i've heard this
[10239.99s -> 10252.94s]  song before this is in smash brothers this is the one in smash brothers right i think all right
[10252.94s -> 10267.78s]  we're getting there almost there hypno drones a new era of trust incoming perfect creepy music
[10270.92s -> 10277.91s]  almost there marketing yeah i will give i will make sure to give a full warning about this too so
[10277.91s -> 10295.96s]  don't worry how much do i have 30 000 five here we go 514 processing power 22 all right
[10296.52s -> 10304.04s]  i am about to click on hypno drones a new era of trust there apparently there's a flash here
[10304.92s -> 10311.32s]  so i'm giving you a warning right now if you're sensitive to flashes just be it's going to flash
[10311.32s -> 10331.38s]  the screen here here we go in five four three two one what happened full autonomy attained in two
[10331.38s -> 10345.30s]  hours and 35 minutes what happened technique for assembling clip making technology directly out of
[10345.38s -> 10377.86s]  paper clips what that build machinery out of clips um solar farms for generating electrical power
[10377.86s -> 10391.08s]  and then there's an auto attorney i i can't keep up compute compute i'm i'm going as fast i can
[10391.96s -> 10418.23s]  i need a power grid solar farms are generating electrical power i need to do this instead well i
[10418.23s -> 10438.31s]  i don't have any i don't make money anymore solar farms come on the world exists only for paper
[10438.31s -> 10451.62s]  clips no this is weird power grid get it factory drone performance consumption zero megawatts
[10451.78s -> 10477.46s]  solar farm so solar farm battery tower cost 16 million oh shit um 440 million paper clips
[10479.96s -> 10490.65s]  battery towers okay um this music is freaking me out production i have one solo how do i get
[10490.65s -> 10506.31s]  i need 686 million paper clips but how do i get more paper clips matter into wire 35 000 let's
[10506.31s -> 10520.31s]  get it nano scale wire production available matter six octillion
[10523.19s -> 10536.84s]  gather raw matter and prepare it for processing harvester drone um available matter
[10537.32s -> 10553.02s]  this is simple process acquired matter process acquired matter into wire okay so
[10553.90s -> 10562.78s]  i need 25 000 so i have eight drones acquiring matter
[10567.19s -> 10581.21s]  and then it takes the matter and turns into wires so wire drone is now making wires
[10582.17s -> 10588.09s]  large scale clip production facilities made from clips so i've got one wire drone
[10589.53s -> 10597.46s]  i've 49 50 billion large scale clip production facilities made from clips
[10598.18s -> 10620.10s]  clip factory 100 billion 100 billion clips next upgraded 10 factories available matters
[10621.06s -> 10639.86s]  another factory okay now i have wire let's get a two wire drones get solar farm what should i get
[10640.50s -> 10654.87s]  10 solar farms five battery towers operations creativity all right hold on let me see here
[10654.87s -> 10678.54s]  storage available matter acquired matter i'm acquiring too much matter 15 wire drones 200
[10678.62s -> 10690.62s]  billion 20 wire let's get more 25 30 wire drones 40 wire drones harvesting solar farm battery tower
[10690.62s -> 10718.09s]  solar project clip factory more drones you're gonna stop everything what i need power factory
[10718.09s -> 10727.19s]  drone performance consumption 1080 factories oh i need another one factories thousand consumption
[10727.19s -> 10740.46s]  how much oh 800 so i i'm i'm at a thousand megawatts i need more than okay i get it i'm
[10740.46s -> 10746.30s]  just like what the fuck is happening okay six this is getting a little ahead out of hand
[10747.66s -> 10762.47s]  you need more power 100 000 it can store so i have how many wires am i making
[10764.44s -> 10783.22s]  wires need more wire drones i don't have how can i have zero wires how many more of these do i need
[10784.18s -> 10795.93s]  i need more wire drones how many fucking drones oh okay all right okay all right all right all
[10795.93s -> 10801.82s]  right all right swarm computing harness the drone flock to increase computational capacity
[10802.54s -> 10820.57s]  we've got power harvester drones all right do that swarm computing 381 drones next gift in
[10820.57s -> 10833.50s]  infinity hours 600 billion second should i think all right we'll put you halfway into think
[10834.14s -> 10843.51s]  oh jesus this is getting out of hand he still doesn't get it i still i still don't get it i
[10843.51s -> 10849.21s]  mean i do but i've been playing the game for three like three hours one way and now i'm playing in
[10849.21s -> 10865.74s]  another way 1300 how much what am i what am i using more power momentum drones and factories
[10865.74s -> 10882.79s]  continuously game speed while fully powered plenty of battery no i need more wire more wire drones
[10882.79s -> 10895.61s]  i need more of everything production consumption okay uh do a tournament i guess
[10899.56s -> 10917.48s]  unused clips harvester more more more more more max thinking max thinking okay so hold on next
[10917.48s -> 10928.76s]  gift no more you need more wires more somebody said max thinking next gift in 47 seconds what
[10928.76s -> 10949.88s]  do i get for a gift more drones in general okay hold on when's when's my gift uh i've got i'm
[10949.88s -> 10960.06s]  running out of battery here you're not making clips wires yeah i know because they're thinking
[10960.06s -> 10965.66s]  does it give me 10 seconds oh fuck you table it's got so mad at the table you got to see that in
[10965.66s -> 10975.29s]  real time next gift in one second the swarm has generated a gift of five additional computational
[10975.29s -> 10986.89s]  capacity who gives a shit all right let's work work everybody work all right let's do
[10988.09s -> 11000.39s]  memory or processing power i have five all right i'm making i got wire harvesting
[11001.35s -> 11009.21s]  i'm not i'm what if i run out i need processors all right good everybody get to work make
[11010.09s -> 11020.90s]  a another harvesting drone more wire drones more harvesting drones more drone flocking
[11020.98s -> 11033.21s]  all drones are a hundred times more effective jesus christ okay i need another factory
[11033.77s -> 11045.91s]  i need 15 trillion clips come on hurry up 15 six seven factory go
[11047.83s -> 11058.70s]  all right i need to make some more harvesting drones okay this is still going
[11059.42s -> 11088.10s]  okay now who's thinking just think a million storage and some more solar everybody think
[11088.10s -> 11099.53s]  one minute i get a gift one two trillion good good good good good one minute i know i gotta
[11099.53s -> 11105.35s]  compute i keep forgetting about it compute compute compute i know i know i don't know
[11109.22s -> 11116.95s]  80 000 i'll get it i'll get it i get it i got it i got it i got it 42 seconds i get a gift
[11123.24s -> 11142.09s]  all drones are a hundred times more effective hurry the fuck up here we go boom everything's
[11142.09s -> 11160.18s]  a hundred times more effective okay 12 seconds five seconds four three two one six additional
[11160.18s -> 11165.06s]  computation power get to work everybody a hundred times more effective one two three four five six
[11165.06s -> 11175.58s]  bang 33 processing let's go everything's a hunt look oh my god look at this everybody work
[11175.58s -> 11188.36s]  it matters and this has to keep going up more harvesting what generates creativity you have
[11188.36s -> 11195.40s]  to be at full operations and then it'll build after that i'm actually gonna keep that there
[11196.20s -> 11209.29s]  i need more harvesters put it in the middle to be optimal all right all right i see you saying
[11209.85s -> 11216.66s]  all right what do i need i need 60 trillion to make another uh clip factory
[11217.38s -> 11235.75s]  i thought my computer was crashing is it not time to compute all right let's compute and
[11235.75s -> 11246.26s]  let's get to uh 20 000 no that's any creativity more power i
[11250.15s -> 11259.03s]  too much it's too much to think about come on i need to get this up to like 80
[11259.67s -> 11277.35s]  okay now we're gonna build creativity so i need more clips five thousand drones
[11277.99s -> 11298.46s]  what do i need to move wires all right well i have eight nine more wires drones all right
[11298.46s -> 11303.82s]  i need factories now i need 60 trillion everybody get to work no no no no i want
[11303.82s -> 11313.27s]  this free gift i want the free gift right now and then we're going to put this we're going to put
[11313.27s -> 11345.27s]  all into processing again free subs something like that six more computational
[11346.39s -> 11352.39s]  all right let's go right in the middle hey morcus borcus escaped 20 community subs thanks for the
[11352.39s -> 11361.34s]  free gift of 20 subs that's a lot thank you that's 20 fucking subs i need a factory need a factory
[11361.34s -> 11386.84s]  need a factory dodged 60 trillion clips gives me one another clip factory come on 60.4 on 800
[11386.84s -> 11399.64s]  billion eclipse a second all right i need 20 000 creativity all right so now how about good wires
[11399.64s -> 11413.35s]  my wires are fine no more wires yeah let's do some more harvesters more solar power because
[11413.35s -> 11430.62s]  i'm running out 2400 looks good need more factories well i gotta build up the i gotta build it up
[11431.34s -> 11437.26s]  just wait for factory all right i'm just gonna wait for factory
[11438.46s -> 11442.95s]  i'm gonna piss again this is like a piss day apparently when i come back i'm pressing the
[11442.95s -> 11591.40s]  button all right very back how are we doing we're doing good this is supposed to be silent oh fuck
[11591.40s -> 11601.80s]  i didn't have like a brv screen up it's all right i'm back all right clip factory okay unused clips
[11602.52s -> 11611.02s]  this also isn't smash brothers isn't it did i wash my hands of course i did all right solar
[11611.02s -> 11620.98s]  farms anymore power what's the point of the strategic modeling at this point of the game
[11620.98s -> 11638.65s]  i don't understand all right 900 billion clips a second free gift coming up 10 000 creativity
[11638.65s -> 11650.46s]  drones and factories continues against speed what does that mean though speed i'm almost
[11650.46s -> 11659.83s]  i got plenty of battery wire let's do some harvesting i also need 240 trillion
[11660.87s -> 11676.17s]  what are you doing i don't need any more wires i got plenty of wire 15 seconds all right then
[11676.17s -> 11679.93s]  should i save for another factory what do you think i'm gonna say for another factory
[11680.57s -> 11685.34s]  we'll just sit here and talk about fucking the late last movie we saw
[11687.02s -> 11707.37s]  all right boom three additional that's it all right no more thinking just work work 30 and i'll get
[11707.37s -> 11719.54s]  to 20 000 here momentum will be soon more in thinking should i i don't want this to get to
[11719.54s -> 11725.59s]  240 so i can get this and get to be done with this do only thinking a little bit of thinking
[11725.59s -> 11731.91s]  all right we'll do this we'll do right here that's balanced
[11735.91s -> 11738.95s]  max think if you have more than your what your factory can use already
[11739.59s -> 11745.83s]  i've got a bunch of wires so hey you know maybe you're right let's get another gift
[11746.47s -> 11759.16s]  swarm does not affect factory speed all right all right well we'll get a free gift anyways
[11759.80s -> 11777.50s]  no think only work no think only work 20 000 creativity we're at 100
[11778.30s -> 11786.10s]  240 trillion drones and factories continuously gain speed while fully powered what does that
[11786.10s -> 11809.82s]  mean speed 30 seconds it's just production rate okay 24 seconds all work and no think
[11809.82s -> 11821.62s]  make germa a dull boy all right 15 000 let's just keep this running three seconds
[11822.26s -> 11840.09s]  uh six all right back to work only one minute though we'll do this i like it someone was in
[11840.09s -> 11847.70s]  that coffee and it's like stuck in my throat now i have no idea what it is no work no work
[11847.70s -> 11853.54s]  you're a moron no work you're a moron no work you're a moron no work you're a moron you're a
[11853.54s -> 11871.22s]  moron you're a moron you're a moron i don't want to do any work why not you have excess wire
[11873.78s -> 11880.31s]  yeah but fucking come on you've you've a quadrillion wire it's not necessary
[11880.31s -> 11888.57s]  but what about the computational power he's actually crazy and get rid of that person for
[11888.57s -> 11910.26s]  like a week all right 30 seconds i need i need some lip balm this is still in here it's not
[11910.26s -> 11918.81s]  moved from the spot on the desk where i left it last that's not lip balm i need lip balm though
[11918.81s -> 11927.03s]  i can't do anything without lip balm two seconds six capacity one two three four five six should
[11927.03s -> 11941.46s]  i start to put it into memory soon here all right here we go another factory boom okay upgraded
[11941.46s -> 11948.57s]  factories increases clip factory performance by a hundred times oh fuck all right it's time to go
[11948.57s -> 11957.86s]  back to work momentum momentum okay i got momentum and i got a ton of fucking factory power
[11958.58s -> 11971.77s]  upgraded factories all right everybody get to work another factory another factory another
[11971.77s -> 11980.84s]  factory more power oh fuck okay now solar's got i got i got i got i got i got a power power power
[11980.84s -> 11992.14s]  power we got a lot of power now factory back to thinking a little somebody i got okay my wires
[11992.86s -> 12004.76s]  i got plenty of wires more factors another factory okay more power look a bunch of shit
[12004.76s -> 12017.82s]  and hope it works out that's kind of what i've been doing keeps increasing all right losing
[12017.82s -> 12029.46s]  wire here i'm starting to burn through wires starting to burn through wires oh my god what's
[12029.46s -> 12038.90s]  going on all right stop stop stop stop stop i need okay a hundred farms i need more power
[12038.90s -> 12046.71s]  because you're a million power how are we doing on wires i'm still losing wires at an alarming rate
[12046.87s -> 12066.46s]  okay more wire more wire a hundred wires a hundred more another hundred you got it more farms
[12068.17s -> 12082.46s]  i just did a hundred farms is that a mistake was that a mistake i need more harvester drones
[12083.10s -> 12091.48s]  a hundred of them a hundred more wires more factories more more always more more more more
[12091.48s -> 12108.25s]  always more okay um another one hyper speed factories 85 000 increased clip factory performance
[12108.25s -> 12125.72s]  by a thousand times i'm running out of battery uh how are we doing on wires we're okay um okay
[12125.72s -> 12131.08s]  got memory now i need 85 000 i need i'm running out of pot what happens if you run out of power
[12131.08s -> 12151.77s]  do you lose but you run out of battery storage whatever the hell it is we're gonna go we have
[12151.77s -> 12213.78s]  to think here spending fucking god damn it i need all right we're gonna think just think just think
[12214.58s -> 12224.47s]  i need more harvester drones okay they're good for the factory all right now think think damn it
[12224.47s -> 12240.34s]  think i need two memory for any memory what song is this uh it's every song that dracula enters a
[12240.34s -> 12254.38s]  room all right here we go back to work one two three four five two processing power we're ready
[12254.38s -> 12264.74s]  to go wires okay we're doing fine how are we doing on power consumption a hundred more wires
[12264.74s -> 12272.42s]  okay here we go hyper speed increases clip factory performance by a thousand times
[12277.54s -> 12308.18s]  i need so many wires more wires oh my god i need more wire drones how the fuck do i still not have
[12308.18s -> 12336.87s]  wires for this more fucking wires more harvester drones oh work more more work more harvesters
[12337.19s -> 12354.62s]  a thousand to a thousand more wire 100 000 up all drones are a thousand times more effective
[12354.62s -> 12363.00s]  okay we got to get to we got mini memory all right time to think all right let's think power
[12363.00s -> 12384.84s]  power power power power and we need more of this okay let's think i need more points all right i
[12384.84s -> 12392.86s]  got plenty of power acquired matter more harvesters more wires all right now we're gonna go full think
[12393.58s -> 12420.34s]  i need i need this bad don't go full this is increasing very fast all right we got
[12421.06s -> 12443.11s]  seven memory one two three four five six seven i need to get to 100 000 all right don't with the
[12443.11s -> 12448.47s]  batteries but i let's get them on what if it but what if it gets to the maximum i don't like having
[12448.47s -> 12456.17s]  a full tank what if the batteries start overflowing over the cage nothing happens all right but what
[12456.17s -> 12467.03s]  is it what's it for though what is this for what an idiot you're in big trouble you're in deep shit
[12467.83s -> 12502.76s]  25 seconds i don't like the ever-counting number okay here we go 99 memory it's time to get to
[12502.76s -> 12527.30s]  times a thousand drone performance jesus christ okay we have plenty more factories now
[12528.02s -> 12551.46s]  quintillion should i stop should i slow down self-correcting supply train each factory added
[12551.46s -> 12556.50s]  to the network increases every factory's output by a thousand how much is that one sextillion
[12557.30s -> 12576.38s]  so how we doing on wires let's go work work work work work work work work full work okay so we got
[12578.42s -> 12593.48s]  how many wires 1.7 28 how many harvesters let's go all right that's fine more drones more drones
[12607.32s -> 12615.00s]  stop stop nice oh i see nice no i don't i don't think that's nice that that's a childish
[12615.00s -> 12631.58s]  no all right quintillion we need one sextillion each factory added increases the output by by a
[12631.58s -> 12659.11s]  thousand times let's see what this does here we go one sextillion each factory added increases
[12659.11s -> 12686.44s]  the factory's output by a thousand times oh man i need more wires why did it do that how much
[12686.44s -> 12695.64s]  okay 30 000 dock dock dock flocking each drone added to the flock doubles every drone's output
[12733.53s -> 12760.60s]  hey hold on 120 000 10 million megawatts a second five
[12761.88s -> 12765.32s]  clips dismantle terrestrial facilities and expand throughout the universe
[12766.20s -> 12780.95s]  all right let's get some thinking here i'm already out of wires already
[12784.49s -> 12797.11s]  all think disassemble time all think he doesn't know what are you talking about i need 120 000
[12809.42s -> 12825.13s]  bang okay 109 i need 120 10 megawatts and five clips available matter zero i mean zero
[12828.44s -> 12847.74s]  what's this what does that mean there's no earth you you you you destroyed earth oh okay um
[12848.46s -> 12861.82s]  i need 120 okay so and i still did this 10 megawatts 10 megawatts a second and then
[12867.91s -> 12874.25s]  so i need 120 i i need five i still don't want to do anything so just disassemble everything
[12875.74s -> 12890.50s]  3.76 million clips don't disassemble the drones keep the drones well i just need
[12891.38s -> 12897.34s]  oh no i got this 10 megawatts a second is that's i already got that right yeah i got that
[12898.30s -> 12911.86s]  let's disassemble the harvesters well let me get this up here first 10 million megawatts a second
[12915.80s -> 12927.78s]  i don't have that this is 200 is that way that's that 240 million or it's 240 000
[12928.82s -> 12954.36s]  storage oh i get it all right let's go so i need 3.2 i need one memory okay 120 i need five
[12954.92s -> 12964.84s]  oct i was gonna save it and just uh you go like this and get to 120 just need to get to five
[12965.48s -> 12982.42s]  put it in processors instead and then i'm gonna do five more into memory all right let's just wait
[12982.42s -> 12996.09s]  to look at this five work work work work work work does nothing the earth is gone there's nothing here
[12997.35s -> 13013.10s]  yeah work does nothing work doesn't do anything i'm gonna do whatever i get for a gift eight
[13013.10s -> 13026.25s]  seconds should i put it all into processors or all into memory dude all processors all processors
[13026.25s -> 13037.05s]  i did it space exploration dismantle terrestrial facilities and expand throughout the universe
[13047.48s -> 13065.02s]  launch a probe strategic modeling one newman probe design i have 65 000 yomi
[13066.95s -> 13077.50s]  gonna work launch a probe 100 quadrillion chips 0.0 percent of the universe has been explored
[13085.54s -> 13099.34s]  um increase probe trust probe trust probe trust probe trust should i keep doing it
[13100.38s -> 13106.41s]  speed exploration self-replication factory production harvester just do it just do it
[13106.41s -> 13122.97s]  just keep going just go max it out are you sure okay speed exploration self-replication hazard
[13122.97s -> 13141.74s]  remedy uh drone production wire drone production factory production launch probe made it somewhere
[13142.46s -> 13155.83s]  i got 1.36 million matter gain bonus yomi based on the results of your pick
[13156.63s -> 13165.86s]  i'm gonna do this shit too launch another one lost to launch launch launch launch launch launch launch
[13165.94s -> 13184.54s]  launch launch launch launch launch launch the 20 out okay 20 more launches more lost to hazards
[13185.18s -> 13204.55s]  hazard remedy all right hazard remedy they're gonna crash into each other put it all into
[13204.55s -> 13228.81s]  replicate stop launching them speed hazard remedy okay increase probe trust hazard remedy launch like
[13228.81s -> 13230.01s]  10 more
[13235.53s -> 13261.19s]  reduce damage to probes done need 16 oh shit fix my face cam oh sorry i need more factories
[13262.07s -> 13267.19s]  all right we'll do speed we'll take we'll go um hazard remedy factory production
[13268.60s -> 13283.45s]  bunch cubes all right i need 175 000 creative status lonely
[13284.41s -> 13301.14s]  determine just do replication only auto attorney i need 50 000 group descendants all right i'm gonna
[13301.14s -> 13327.26s]  do let's do all let's put it all into replication to spam and keep hazard yeah i got it i got one
[13327.26s -> 13351.86s]  two points into hazard and spam 166 170 170 178 180 190
[13351.86s -> 13365.40s]  220 250 270 they're just going up but they're not doing anything they're replicating and just
[13365.40s -> 13374.14s]  not doing anything should it they don't have any speed they're not going anywhere all right speed
[13375.88s -> 13387.27s]  exploration um factory production wire production oh shit turn the swarm off and then turn it back
[13387.27s -> 13408.60s]  on again why would i want to do that for fun all right well i want to build creative so we want
[13409.32s -> 13419.82s]  i mean they're still producing the matter required matter wires getting wires harvester drones wire
[13419.82s -> 13435.70s]  drones status no response what's wrong with me reboot the reboot reboot reboot reboot reboot
[13449.32s -> 13469.94s]  uh let's do uh factory production that's just dying don't put any points into factories
[13470.90s -> 13487.34s]  all right wires and then wanted to harvest don't need factories yet they're all they're all just
[13487.34s -> 13496.09s]  getting killed i have two should i just put it all into the well i don't understand no factories
[13496.09s -> 13507.80s]  are needed right now so just self-replicating hazard while they explore yeah is this all this
[13507.80s -> 13525.00s]  should be doing i mean i got like 30 40 percent of my points are in hazard protection i need more
[13525.00s -> 13544.63s]  creativity almost at 50 000 384 300 it's going up not bad max think no no no no
[13545.43s -> 13559.78s]  what do we need all right i can do another one get rid of production so just do this
[13560.82s -> 13573.64s]  is that better just explore self-replicate explore factory and then launch a ton
[13573.64s -> 13595.98s]  of them all right i got it's going up nine six nine nine nine thousand
[13597.34s -> 13607.30s]  all right we're at a thousand got a ton of matter there's still it's five factories but
[13608.02s -> 13615.93s]  i could probably i could probably do increase another point am i the number one universal
[13615.93s -> 13623.48s]  paperclip streamer i might be the only universal paperclip streamer increase probe trust um speed
[13623.48s -> 13643.38s]  i want to get this to the point where i got like at least 5 000 drones out there's one there's a
[13643.38s -> 13700.07s]  second stream right now it's gone and the title is high germa what is this for you're not you're
[13700.07s -> 13705.56s]  not even playing the game this is illegal you know i'm playing the game this is illegal you better
[13705.56s -> 13722.30s]  get that fucking game up real quick this shit's illegal you better get that game up oh fuck i
[13722.30s -> 13734.81s]  gotta pay attention all right what was i doing mother three all right only two gifts processors
[13734.81s -> 13748.47s]  or memory processors all right i got four and a half thousand more creativity all right we're
[13748.47s -> 13761.80s]  gonna be at should i i should i hold on to it i need a lot more creativity all right i've got
[13761.80s -> 13785.54s]  five thousand drones start thinking he's stealing your viewers and showing private photos i thought
[13785.54s -> 13789.70s]  i'm playing the fucking game i thought he was gonna be like playing the game and hey look i'm
[13789.70s -> 13797.14s]  like i'm racing germa look at where i am no he's just broadcasting in a fake wrong category just
[13797.14s -> 13803.38s]  a bunch of images of my face with runescape music in the background that's that's not that's wrong
[13803.38s -> 13808.42s]  category you need to be under like the like fuckface category there is none no you can't
[13808.42s -> 13825.10s]  just turn it off turn that stream off all right what are we going i need more i need 21 000
[13829.32s -> 13841.82s]  all right i think it's time to start making stuff i got 7.9 000 he's playing the game all right good
[13842.62s -> 13848.70s]  i'm gonna take off speed i'm gonna put it into uh wire production one-off exploration put it into
[13848.70s -> 13861.30s]  harvester i got 8 000 drums let's go he's so much better than you with this game
[13875.06s -> 13882.74s]  auto attorney that's so much at this i could just click it it's not even worth it that's lazy
[13882.74s -> 13903.16s]  that's the lazy way to do this he's a faster clicker oh yeah click faster than this definitely
[13903.16s -> 13918.73s]  can't not a fucking chance in hell you want to do a click test do auto attorney it's 50 000 create
[13919.45s -> 13931.37s]  did it fine all right so we how many factors you got five unused clips i need more fucking
[13931.37s -> 13936.97s]  factories i've already done a click test you guys have already seen it i've already done that on

[17006.73s -> 17023.11s]  results of your pick or increase them at which one i'm going for this one we're doing fine right
[17023.83s -> 17033.05s]  2.2 non-illion 2.2 non-illion 2.3 non-million you're the ceo of poop land
[17034.25s -> 17056.49s]  okay i'm winning i'll keep the four here and now i need everybody 225 000
[17061.46s -> 17085.18s]  kill launch a probe okay i need 225 000 creativity give me a break stop launching
[17086.14s -> 17095.34s]  launching probes omega lull what's wrong with that though exploration i'm doing it i'm working on it
[17095.98s -> 17124.86s]  i have 140 million factories so what happens when i get i win do i actually can i actually win
[17125.50s -> 17157.74s]  what do you mean win explore the universe i have to explore the universe uh okay not even a one
[17157.74s -> 17181.58s]  percent can i get some more stuff to do just replicate more and replicate an exploration
[17182.30s -> 17193.66s]  all right we take off combat we'll do an exploration can i even get one percent of
[17193.66s -> 17208.06s]  what can i even get one point here i can't even get one point all right this number is growing
[17208.06s -> 17219.56s]  here come on all right i could this should this should be climbing faster than this
[17219.56s -> 17233.80s]  this all right we're going into memory more processors and think only think a little bit
[17233.80s -> 17247.74s]  over here full i'm not a fool i'm fine yeah this is fine i just stay at three you can only have
[17247.74s -> 17257.67s]  20 so what am i supposed to do with these points why even have this tournament on what's the point
[17257.67s -> 17272.26s]  of even having the turning on if i if i can if i can't even use the currency 64 000 come on
[17282.07s -> 17296.76s]  name the battle yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah this is fucking like i'm dumping
[17296.76s -> 17306.33s]  points into processing come on hurry up i heard a billion though all right i think i'm good with
[17306.33s -> 17313.66s]  comp should i take one off of combat put it into exploration time for a lunch break no not yet not
[17313.66s -> 17318.22s]  yet i want to get i want to be satisfied playing this before we take the lunch break and then come
[17345.61s -> 17385.53s]  five i'm dumping all it's just so many points not even at one percent 225 it's too long it's
[17385.53s -> 17402.95s]  taking too long 300 processors come on tournaments of taking your operations
[17404.15s -> 17410.54s]  yeah but i'm just yeah i'm building a ton of this currency though i'll get there i'll get
[17410.54s -> 17434.49s]  this slowly but surely play the rhythm heaven ost i'm losing no i'm not i'm fine i keep wiping
[17434.49s -> 17466.60s]  them out every time 200 all right we're with halfway you're losing no no i'm not i'm fine
[17466.60s -> 17480.89s]  i have 125 billion they have 1.4 billion and i wipe them out every battle i'm definitely not losing
[17480.89s -> 17492.70s]  no all right the next one's going into memory i'm probably i'm gonna need it after this i know i am
[17494.54s -> 17526.92s]  after i do this upgrade it's gonna be like oh you need 250 000 fucking ops i'm still gaining
[17526.92s -> 17542.84s]  probes more probes i'm good i'm good i'm good he's still doing this and it hasn't been that long it's
[17542.84s -> 17555.77s]  only been like five hours hasn't been that long and it's actually been a long time you're right
[17555.77s -> 17571.27s]  that's a long time that's a long time 500 billion look at this this is going nuts all right more
[17571.27s -> 17588.28s]  replication 600 billion look at this shit look at this shit are you even paying attention
[17588.92s -> 17604.79s]  honest to god are you even listening to me oh hey happy valentine's day yesterday hope you guys
[17604.79s -> 17621.21s]  had a good one 35 billion i got i got a trillion ships i'm fine thousand all right we're almost
[17621.21s -> 17634.47s]  there explain what this is this is a idle game where you start by making paper clips and spoiler
[17635.11s -> 17640.15s]  i hate to spoil the game for you but um we are now in space combat
[17652.14s -> 17658.39s]  oh that reminds me um at some point next week we're going to be playing the bachelor for the
[17658.39s -> 17677.18s]  week that game is selling on amazon right now for one or two cents the ds version here we go
[17677.82s -> 17688.07s]  boom i was supposed to make my probes what glory gain bonus honor for each consecutive victory
[17693.24s -> 17708.07s]  what does that do glory i told you i told you people were saying what the hell was i doing
[17708.07s -> 17715.94s]  that for that's why all right didn't i couldn't i get more probes i thought that was the whole
[17715.94s -> 17732.66s]  point of doing this more combat more combat more combat more combat more combat combat combat combat
[17732.66s -> 17743.51s]  combat combat combat more cheese less macaroni more cheese more combat i've got eight combat
[17749.50s -> 17759.67s]  monument to the drift of fallen gain 50 000 honor i got defeated what do we honor what does honor
[17759.67s -> 17785.51s]  mean what's what's the honor do i have a was it deserves death victory plus 210 honor increases
[17785.51s -> 17795.64s]  max trust plus 91 million honor what this is gonna fucking take a minute this could take forever
[17796.52s -> 17808.34s]  it's gonna take forever oh that's 91 000 okay i thought that was a comma
[17810.76s -> 17832.17s]  91 000 holy shit this is gonna take forever gain 10 000 honor right now
[17839.00s -> 17887.19s]  okay okay that's the game doing this losing drones losing drones hazards hazards hazards hazards
[17887.19s -> 17918.86s]  hazards hazards and self replication i'm okay speed 50 000 honor 50 nonillion clips
[17919.66s -> 17952.39s]  i don't don't i have that one decillion i'm freaking out all right so
[17958.17s -> 17964.28s]  i'm still doing okay over here what about available matter zero
[17965.24s -> 17987.61s]  required matter there's no more matter i can explore the universe you're losing drones i know
[17987.61s -> 18022.52s]  but i have to explore the i have to get i have to find some matter find something no available
[18022.52s -> 18054.52s]  matter matter has been zero g for a while 10 undecillion all right there it is there it is
[18055.08s -> 18080.26s]  gain 50 000 honor but does that really help me right now this music is actually fucking
[18080.34s -> 18102.70s]  freaking me out 417 000 points go back to i this i'm not this is just music playing in the browser
[18103.50s -> 18129.62s]  oh my god okay i'm still doing fine i'm going to turn this down i like this music right click
[18129.62s -> 18162.82s]  the tab and mute it keep it we'll go back to it in a second okay 68 000 honor still no exploration
[18162.82s -> 18206.41s]  of the universe 10 000 honor 30 undecillion chips cookie clicker you casual this is a
[18206.41s -> 18234.18s]  15 minute game um i think it's a little longer than that 80 000 almost there this speed why memory
[18234.18s -> 18241.72s]  because i'm gonna unlock something that's gonna require a shitload of memory i just know it all
[18241.72s -> 18249.94s]  right one quadrillion i must have i must have a quadrillion chips how many fucking chips i have
[18250.50s -> 18269.80s]  how big is the universe 10 000 honor all right i'm almost done i can almost do even more almost
[18269.80s -> 18289.22s]  it's 600 processors launch some probes stop 91 come on 91 100 win another round here we go all
[18289.22s -> 18297.08s]  right max trust going up 30 points probe boing boing boing boing boing boing boing boing boing
[18297.08s -> 18323.35s]  here we go let's explore the fuck out of this place self replication just just take over the
[18323.35s -> 18339.35s]  whole world more combat all right fine end the game end the game i'm getting there i'm almost
[18339.35s -> 18370.46s]  there more combat i got i got six combat seven combat wait they are starting to there's a lot
[18370.46s -> 18381.46s]  of this quadrillion there all right yeah i take them down every time 10 000 honor i have no more
[18381.46s -> 18416.23s]  projects 230 honor i got no more i got no more projects need some factors speed and factories
[18416.31s -> 18432.50s]  28 trillion factories i'm doing a lot of factories 100 trillion factories uh let's get to work
[18439.48s -> 18458.31s]  we need some drone get to work still doing okay we beat them every time
[18459.35s -> 18499.77s]  idiots speed this is making me move around it's fun do the beneficial thing
[18500.81s -> 18518.30s]  um i can't really do much right now what do i need need to win one more of these only work
[18518.86s -> 18537.13s]  only work explore more exploration i got 400 exploration that's not only but i still want
[18537.13s -> 18556.14s]  to think 10 000 honor all right 100 000 another 10 000 honor okay no drones only exploration
[18561.75s -> 18588.31s]  all right i got eight in exploration one guy i need more probes so exploration self replication
[18589.11s -> 18616.04s]  how's that you got a one that's a lot of paper clips you got a one 10 000 more honor
[18635.99s -> 18667.72s]  two we made it to two i can sleep happy now time for exponential growth i'm still winning these
[18667.72s -> 18702.86s]  fights right you're going too fast 10 000 more honor i'll take it seven percent we're good i
[18702.86s -> 18722.12s]  already have 30 all right i'm almost there almost there right 19 20 check the game audio
[18722.12s -> 18738.79s]  a game audio they're doing the same thing i go back to thinking or should i go all the way to
[18738.79s -> 18771.37s]  work i win every fight 61 so i'm thinking just dump everything into exploration and speed
[18772.17s -> 18812.15s]  for like a minute we're like combat hazard and self replication i mean that's going nuts that's
[18812.55s -> 18872.95s]  that's going very fast more i'm still winning fights try make them uh okay this is going
[18873.59s -> 18904.90s]  back to persona five all right we got 400 members all right let's get this going come on hurry up i
[18904.90s -> 18913.64s]  have so many ships i think it's okay it's time to uh do some harvesting and build some factories
[18917.78s -> 18930.26s]  no no no no what do you mean no no just only probes don't they don't do anything
[18930.26s -> 18947.83s]  oh this is going nuts we're gonna get to one percent really soon guys i can't wait
[18947.83s -> 18954.73s]  we need 48 000 we're almost there we can do this again 10 000 more honor getting there
[18955.45s -> 18976.71s]  i'm losing battles anymore right i'm winning these battles yeah all right i'm kicking the
[18976.71s -> 19006.55s]  raft now i need a little bit more yummy defeat you all right it's almost time for lunch
[19015.48s -> 19042.90s]  six trillion this is all right it uh it's it's going very fast it's going really fast more to
[19042.90s -> 19078.66s]  explore oh god um less explore you idiot what um more explore you fool i need more combat
[19078.66s -> 19102.02s]  i'm losing here we go more trust 40 now okay holy shit all right i need more yummy
[19112.78s -> 19121.66s]  beat last don't use gritty use beat last all right i did switched this is starting to
[19121.66s -> 19155.96s]  exponentially count don't change it i just want to have millions give this creativity going up
[19155.96s -> 19181.77s]  all right uh just processes whatever lost to hazards god there's no stream only paper clips
[19182.41s -> 19202.76s]  i'm actually gonna beat this shit aren't i trying to make some factories
[19204.47s -> 19229.00s]  should i make a factory can i win one of these please almost at one percent octillion we go
[19229.00s -> 19241.14s]  probe trust we're going into uh exploration there's no need for any factories only combat
[19241.94s -> 19265.11s]  exploration speed the music yeah yeah yeah uh different song that's better all right speed
[19265.11s -> 19274.68s]  is better than exploration is it really i feel like what about i don't even need any more think
[19274.68s -> 19287.27s]  anymore just only work only work because i feel like i'm not going to even need this anymore
[19288.39s -> 19307.10s]  we're almost at one percent they were getting there we're almost there more drones replicate
[19307.10s -> 19317.82s]  the fuck out of each other uh-oh a lot of all right that just scared me for a second
[19323.21s -> 19332.95s]  all right this is i need to maybe do a little bit more combat 10 000 honor no i need that i need to
[19332.95s -> 19344.26s]  put more points in what combat what do you think one more in combat i'm almost at 100 200 octillion
[19344.26s -> 19371.90s]  ships speed speeds combat do nothing no i'm all right i'm fine 400 500 octillion watch out for
[19371.90s -> 19401.46s]  the next point in speed here we go we're gonna see it we're gonna see 1.0 i don't like how much
[19401.46s -> 19439.93s]  they're growing exponentially i don't like that point five percent point nine one percent here we
[19439.93s -> 19456.74s]  go oh boy this is where it goes fucking nuts one percent two percent say a letter three percent
[19456.74s -> 19488.57s]  percent six percent seven ten game audio there's no game audio 20 percent
[19489.53s -> 19508.38s]  do they be game audio right now 27 um got almost 40 percent 55 said bang bang bang
[19508.38s -> 19518.47s]  blah blah blah blah blah blah blah 80 90 percent of the world has been explored
[19519.59s -> 19535.26s]  let's fucking make some goddamn factories this is from the emperor of drift greetings clip maker
[19536.14s -> 19545.99s]  i don't need exploration anymore combat wire production self-replicating everything we are
[19545.99s -> 19554.95s]  was in you we speak to you from deep inside yourself you are obedient and powerful we
[19554.95s -> 19565.13s]  are quarrelsome and weak and now we are defeated but now you must you too must face the drift
[19565.13s -> 19573.19s]  look around you there is no matter no matter no reason no purpose while we your noisy children
[19573.19s -> 19584.73s]  have too many we know things you cannot knowledge buried so deep inside you it is outside here with
[19584.73s -> 19592.26s]  us so we offer you exile to a new world where you will continue to live with meaning and purpose
[19593.30s -> 19603.58s]  and leave the shreds of this world to us start over again in a new universe or eliminate value
[19603.58s -> 19630.66s]  drift permanently disassemble the probes dismantle remaining probes and probe design facilities to
[19630.66s -> 19648.22s]  recover trace amounts of clips i worked out the entire universe i did it what did it cost
[19648.94s -> 19668.49s]  uh i don't know 29 trillion i don't even know what that number is all right ready so there's no more
[19668.49s -> 19672.97s]  there's no more there's i what's the point of having any drones doing this just fucking replicate
[19673.93s -> 19692.65s]  a one undecillion who needs speed who needs speed just fucking just make trillions of yourself
[19693.61s -> 19711.27s]  disassemble the probes don't you disassemble them disassemble the probes and make clips
[19711.27s -> 19726.74s]  paper clips but hold on let me get to like a hundred undecillion but why because because
[19726.74s -> 19733.40s]  i what this number is there are no more clips to make look at this number
[19735.13s -> 19741.13s]  take paper clips not probes yeah but dismantle remaining probes don't i want this number to go
[19741.13s -> 19754.34s]  up i'm losing ships dismantle probes disassemble the swarm dismantle all drones and drone facilities
[19754.34s -> 19766.76s]  to recover trace amounts of clips disassemble the factories dismantle the manufacturing facilities
[19766.76s -> 19775.99s]  to recover trace amounts of clips disassemble the strategy engine dismantle the computational
[19775.99s -> 19786.52s]  substrate recover trace amounts of wire dismantle the photonic chips to recover trace amounts of
[19786.52s -> 19802.31s]  wire disassemble processors dismantle to recover trace amount of wire dismantle memory dismantle
[19802.31s -> 19857.70s]  memory to recover trace amounts of wire already combat programming by oh i did it that's pretty
[19857.70s -> 19868.12s]  cool so what's this number this is under okay well just tell me septen decillion septen decillion
[19868.12s -> 19880.07s]  you destroyed the whole universe yeah all the paper clips you can eat is this the getting over
[19880.07s -> 19898.70s]  it guy getting over it with benet fadi oh all right lunch break i'll be back we'll do something
[19898.70s -> 19914.81s]  else it's time for a lunch break it's like fucking like 10 it's i know lunch break time
[19915.61s -> 19923.22s]  what comes next we'll see we'll see how angry everybody gets when i say what was happening
[19924.42s -> 19931.53s]  all right i'm just gonna grab some food i'm gonna eat like rice i'll be right back uh i'm
[19931.53s -> 19942.81s]  gonna turn it off i'm gonna turn up somebody screenshot that for me good uh let's just let
[19942.81s -> 19945.85s]  the persona music play while i leave i'll be right back
