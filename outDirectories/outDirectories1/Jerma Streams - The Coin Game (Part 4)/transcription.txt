[6.52s -> 14.74s]  Hello, should I leave the title as buying and selling organs? I feel like that's uh, kind of morbid for the next game we're playing.
[15.18s -> 29.50s]  What are you- what are they doing? What is- what is the chat doing right now? What's the meaning of this?
[29.50s -> 47.14s]  I broke the chat? What'd I do? What is- what are you- why- why are you revolting against me? What are you doing?
[47.34s -> 64.28s]  Put us back in emote only mode. I will. I'm gonna drop this volume a little bit. What's- what's this little-
[64.28s -> 67.82s]  What's this bit that they're doing? Is this like a- what- what- what little routine is this?
[77.51s -> 93.50s]  Capture this game? What- what do they add? Is it actually like a big substantial update? That's pretty cool.
[93.50s -> 99.83s]  I love this game too. Video quality, uh,
[101.07s -> 106.77s]  Super computer. Looks fine. Mouse sensitivity, bring that down.
[108.52s -> 117.57s]  Leaderboards, I don't need the leaderboards. Who cares? Do 90 FOV. I do need to do this.
[117.57s -> 132.13s]  I remember this- I remember the sound effects were very loud. Turn that up. Okay, go back to the organ game.
[132.13s -> 140.11s]  I'm- I don't make me scream into my monitor. I really will. Okay, so I think I'm just gonna
[140.11s -> 145.51s]  just do the, sort of, birthday mode, because I just want to play the new stuff. Survival takes a little too long, I think.
[146.07s -> 148.95s]  Click play. Oh shit, that's cool.
[149.47s -> 161.49s]  Yeah, let's just do birthday mode. Go back to the organ game. You guys-
[162.49s -> 173.83s]  You guys- stop being such butt heads, okay? You guys are being butt heads. I'm gonna tell mom.
[173.95s -> 178.75s]  This is like the I'm telling mom. You're like holding your finger and putting it in my face, like I'm not touching you,
[178.75s -> 195.20s]  I'm not touching you. I'm about to yell for mom. All right, here we go. So what- what are the- what's the additions?
[200.59s -> 208.90s]  Which, um, arcade should I go to? Did I shoot myself in the head? I thought it was-
[209.54s -> 218.61s]  No, what do you mean, new text message? Happy birthday, kid. All right, I got 200 bucks. The bullet went backwards.
[220.08s -> 221.96s]  Go to the-
[221.96s -> 231.80s]  Please don't listen to chat. Don't change the title. One-Eyed Billy's. Oh, okay. I forget where One-Eyed Billy's is.
[232.44s -> 249.18s]  Larry's Pawn Shop, Larry's Arcade. Isn't it down on the coast somewhere? Oh, we'll find it. This is very loud.
[249.18s -> 257.68s]  This is exactly what I was talking about. The outside of this arcade looks like a strip club.
[265.23s -> 273.16s]  I do appreciate the GPS that's here now. All right, One-Eyed-
[278.20s -> 281.84s]  Don't hit me again, please. Okay.
[282.56s -> 297.67s]  Stuff it. Where is One-Eyed Billy's? Did they add another arcade or is it they add more machines to- Oh, One-Eyed Billy's is this way.
[297.67s -> 314.52s]  Oh my god, dude. There's a whole new arcade?
[315.16s -> 323.66s]  What? Holy shit, dude, you wouldn't believe it. The Oregon game just got a huge update. You should check it out.
[325.69s -> 336.70s]  You dick.
[336.74s -> 345.96s]  How do I reliably get over there? I guess I have to run.
[346.76s -> 354.13s]  Remember, your stream gave me acne. I didn't do anything.
[354.77s -> 376.61s]  Eden Animals, that doesn't work right now. All right, One-Eyed Billy's is right here. Let's go check it out. I'm actually very interested.
[386.83s -> 393.87s]  By the way, I'm just realizing, aren't I like 13 or something? I feel like this would be incredible. Where are my parents?
[393.87s -> 410.68s]  This would be really dangerous. All right, One-Eyed Billy's. Adventure and Fun Center.
[414.35s -> 421.08s]  Celtics lost. I have not seen a Celtics player shoot a basket in probably like 11 years.
[421.08s -> 430.66s]  I have not watched a single game. I'm sorry. All right, should we get a pizza?
[431.22s -> 443.95s]  24-hour delivery. Earn money today. Pirate pizza. Wait, what? Deliver pirate pizzas. Click here to accept a delivery.
[444.35s -> 458.63s]  Fried baked pizzas. Pizza delivery. Seven dollars. Wait, did I just buy a pizza? Why am I purchasing this? What?
[458.99s -> 467.86s]  Why did I have to buy this? Who am I delivering this to? Who is supposed to be getting this? Oh my fucking god.
[468.14s -> 479.75s]  Where's my car? Where's my car? Where's the car? Did you expect it for free?
[479.75s -> 485.14s]  I don't expect to pay for a customer's order and then bring it to them. The customer pays for it
[485.14s -> 493.34s]  and then I get paid to bring it. Why do I have to pay for the customer's food?
[500.06s -> 506.58s]  The sound just got removed. Can I just run there? I definitely can run there.
[510.88s -> 513.86s]  You look out your window, like you order like
[514.58s -> 517.84s]  Uber eats or something and you look out your window and there's a guy just fucking
[518.26s -> 520.78s]  sprinting down your street with a bag of food in his hand.
[520.82s -> 533.46s]  He's in full stride and he still comes up as a car on the app when you look at the app and you know
[533.46s -> 546.45s]  you can see where the car is going. Oh, where am I? Where am I? Where am I?
[547.77s -> 559.07s]  What I don't what what where am I? Where am I? I don't know. What am I? Where am I? I'm the red?
[559.07s -> 578.00s]  Is this their house? Oh pizza. How do I get my inventory?
[582.66s -> 589.07s]  Hey, don't call my limo. What are you doing? Where am I? Did I just? No, I don't care.
[589.59s -> 594.46s]  I don't I want to go back to deliver that pizza. No, I need to take me to the place
[594.46s -> 602.52s]  I just was. I need to go back and deliver that pizza. I need to buy limo. Can I take it? Where am I? No, wait
[602.52s -> 612.78s]  Oh, for the love of God. Okay. Hold on. Wait. I have a car. Don't I have a bike?
[612.90s -> 628.02s]  Don't I have something to I don't have a car or anything. Okay this way. Oh, it looks like my
[629.07s -> 635.68s]  Uber Eats driver is right down the street. Let me open up the the blinds and see sprinting down the street
[635.68s -> 638.98s]  He's got a bag in his hand. He's here. Oh
[640.02s -> 645.66s]  He just got hit by a car. I think I hope he's okay. No limo just pulled up
[645.82s -> 669.35s]  He's standing outside the door. He just got in the limo left. He's back running. Okay straight. All right, do I flashlight?
[669.35s -> 678.63s]  I thought I did you're not gonna make it. Yes. I have a hundred and twenty four seconds. I'm running a hundred and twenty five miles per hour
[678.63s -> 689.49s]  I'll be okay. Which house is it? It's this one right here. But where's my inventory? I?
[690.63s -> 711.84s]  I haven't played this in a long time. I have my credit card. K is inventory. I don't think so. It's on the watch tab
[711.84s -> 722.58s]  All right, where the hell is this place right ahead? It's not this building. It's building right in front of me
[722.58s -> 744.08s]  I need to take it out golf cart Beach Billy's warehouse factory. There it is. Which house is it? Is this but okay?
[744.08s -> 756.04s]  It's right here. Where where is it right here? Oh
[758.25s -> 770.58s]  God this one. Where is this house?
[771.06s -> 790.84s]  What's happening? Is it this house right here a dollar tip and he's slim. I actually just got one dollar tip
[790.88s -> 816.64s]  Okay, there's my limo in here. Let me in my car. Why can I not get in here?
[816.64s -> 839.40s]  I locked myself out of my own car. I can't take this off the card in this lot. I go to
[840.24s -> 867.04s]  One-eyed Billy's already not impounded. It's fine. Drive your car up here. It's not even that steep, please
[867.32s -> 876.44s]  You're me you should play at least the pain playing the painful is an arcade machine here at least the painful
[876.72s -> 894.23s]  All right. Finally, let's play some of the new games very excited. There are no breaks. I don't have breaks
[894.23s -> 903.82s]  I don't have breaks
[903.82s -> 906.62s]  Randomizing the play tables and coin. What do we play tables?
[906.90s -> 913.54s]  Well, you said there was a new boat ride to take which will do that sounds like fun
[913.54s -> 922.33s]  I want to do this. This is fun. I score is 175. I think I've done this already, but I love this game
[922.33s -> 952.47s]  I can't do it by a I got my 80s just freaking out. No matter what you guys. I can't trace anything
[952.51s -> 958.03s]  I also can't do this either. It makes me like want to puke. Oh, I did it. Oh
[964.40s -> 978.69s]  You play against another person. What's happening? Why am I getting attacked? What was that? Who just did that?
[978.93s -> 1026.08s]  I'm gonna fuck with me again. Oh hoops. I gotta get it in the spot a little higher. Come on
[1026.36s -> 1037.90s]  What's the point of a backboard? They always say aim for the backboard, but you never see like NBA players do that
[1037.90s -> 1054.96s]  They always just swish it or dunk it out and do but not really Mountain Dew
[1054.96s -> 1063.12s]  Oh, what's this one? You see these in like Dave and Buster sometimes you always wonder there's so much room
[1063.12s -> 1069.63s]  This is such a huge gigantic machine. It's so unnecessary
[1070.09s -> 1076.44s]  And this is by the way, this is one of the worst machines in the entire arcade. This thing sucks
[1076.64s -> 1085.43s]  Nobody likes playing this I've never seen anybody have fun playing this game. They always like swipe their card
[1085.43s -> 1090.63s]  They press it once they go. All right. This is right. What's over there? What's that over there? Is that a time crisis?
[1090.79s -> 1093.04s]  Nobody likes this game
[1093.04s -> 1103.91s]  And by the way, this game is always one of the most expensive ones in the entire casino 50 tickets. Hell, yeah
[1104.87s -> 1128.09s]  30 tickets. Oh, yeah in the middle what I get. What was that? What?
[1130.69s -> 1133.39s]  559 I got the jackpot. Oh my god
[1134.43s -> 1159.60s]  Fake I'll give you another one. This is roulette for children. How many balls do I get tickets? Awesome? Yeah, I'll do it again
[1162.26s -> 1176.16s]  Say how much this sucks again. I think I just did it again. Holy shit. All right, I'm getting really lucky
[1177.72s -> 1198.25s]  Mystery, what's the mystery? Wow, that's a lot. I mean, this is a really good return on my investment
[1198.25s -> 1217.79s]  Turn it up a little bit. It's kind of low. I do it again. What is wrong with me, by the way, okay
[1230.77s -> 1241.05s]  I'm just gravitating towards this. This is all the little kids at the skeeball machine. You just open up Chuck E cheese and it's just like
[1242.05s -> 1244.85s]  I
[1248.01s -> 1251.99s]  Just keep it go go go go go go play skee ball skee ball skee ball skee skee skee
[1251.99s -> 1269.10s]  I think I might this might be broken. I'm not sure what to do about this. I take my tickets
[1269.90s -> 1286.22s]  Think I might as a leave and come back. All right. Well, this one's broken. Just like at every fucking arcade
[1286.22s -> 1289.34s]  I'm not let me tell you at every arcade I've ever been to
[1289.62s -> 1296.00s]  It's always like one or two of these are just not working and they always have the best prizes in them
[1296.00s -> 1298.00s]  Is that some kind of crazy conspiracy?
[1298.24s -> 1303.85s]  It's always the ones that are not on that have the best prizes inside
[1304.25s -> 1317.55s]  This one's kind of cool and what they should do is take the prizes out of the one that's broken and put it in the
[1317.55s -> 1318.99s]  One you can actually use
[1318.99s -> 1349.25s]  There's a fidget spinner in here. These my tickets. Oh, those are 80 tickets. All right. Okay. I want the fidget spinner
[1349.25s -> 1351.88s]  I'm gonna get it. I
[1352.24s -> 1371.58s]  Like the golf balls is cool. Is that money? I don't think I can rotate it settle down. That was way off
[1371.82s -> 1375.86s]  I think I got it though. Oh, come on. Was it a razor?
[1376.50s -> 1381.96s]  Good again
[1381.96s -> 1389.70s]  What's the biggest prize I've ever won?
[1389.78s -> 1402.32s]  Um, I'll hit the flaming finger. He doesn't want to talk about I think I goes flated finger get your flame on and you have to
[1402.32s -> 1408.68s]  Go like with your finger. It's a trace inside the lines
[1409.24s -> 1413.49s]  I've beaten that one before and I got I think like a thousand tickets whatever the jackpot was
[1413.49s -> 1423.28s]  I actually beat it. I made this up. It's an actual game. I won't hold on. No, I'm not done. I want that
[1423.32s -> 1425.88s]  Whatever it is
[1426.16s -> 1433.66s]  There's a strategy with that though is you don't it it's you get friction if you use the pad of your finger
[1434.14s -> 1439.06s]  So you have to use almost like the top of your nail and the the top part of your finger
[1439.06s -> 1444.28s]  So you use almost your fingernail and the small part of the pad at the top right where the fingernail reaches
[1444.82s -> 1450.60s]  Like right where your fingernail touches your pad of your finger is that's what you should be using to play flaming finger
[1450.84s -> 1464.05s]  The money. Oh my goodness. Come on
[1467.40s -> 1470.32s]  What is flaming finger flaming finger is a arcade game?
[1470.92s -> 1476.33s]  You have to trace inside of a gigantic maze in five seconds the whole maze
[1476.85s -> 1481.57s]  Is that not in?
[1481.57s -> 1492.52s]  Arcades anymore. I feel like I've seen it. Oh my goodness. Please just give that to me. I
[1499.96s -> 1513.88s]  Need one of the fidget spinners. It's this why is it swaying so much? That's how they get you stop swaying
[1519.00s -> 1530.76s]  Give it to me. You're doing great
[1533.18s -> 1542.26s]  That was makeup on that's what the face came isn't on. There you got me. I don't want movement
[1554.82s -> 1561.46s]  I see I can't see from the other side. Oh my god. Stop moving around so much
[1561.86s -> 1569.52s]  All these golf balls are messing everything up. Just just leave I'll come back later
[1570.08s -> 1575.64s]  Just leave I'm done. What's this one?
[1576.12s -> 1590.45s]  Fishy fishy. Ooh, this is cool. This is definitely wasn't here last time now the crane
[1592.20s -> 1597.16s]  I wonder how much better this just you know, let's see. I'm going with it for the
[1597.56s -> 1607.01s]  Flam the shell whatever it is right in front that one down right there grab it
[1607.57s -> 1611.78s]  Let's see it first try. Come on
[1612.42s -> 1614.34s]  Oh, yeah
[1614.34s -> 1623.84s]  Give me another one. I think I got this one. This one should be easy
[1626.72s -> 1634.35s]  Oh, yeah, if that grips. No, it's okay hit the snail
[1634.99s -> 1638.43s]  I'll get it. How much is this worth?
[1638.75s -> 1650.54s]  Probably sell that I want to play the air hockey. I play against someone
[1652.24s -> 1656.94s]  Oh, okay
[1656.94s -> 1658.86s]  What don't laugh at me?
[1658.86s -> 1670.16s]  You guys have to understand the strategy with air hockey
[1670.80s -> 1675.36s]  As you just stay completely still right in the middle and your friend will fuck everything up
[1676.08s -> 1678.08s]  You just don't have to move. They're gonna try to be like
[1678.80s -> 1680.80s]  It's gonna bounce all over the place
[1681.52s -> 1684.61s]  Well, this was an ai
[1684.61s -> 1688.85s]  Your goal is you want to go straight forward let your friend just do a bunch of crazy shit. They're gonna screw up
[1689.57s -> 1692.64s]  Because they're always gonna bounce to the edges
[1695.78s -> 1699.22s]  Just defend this middle part and you'll be completely fine. See what happened
[1701.01s -> 1706.96s]  Is a crowd forming
[1706.96s -> 1710.32s]  This like four or five inches right here is the only thing you should be concerned about at all
[1713.42s -> 1719.74s]  Just wait for your buddy to rear back and go smash and then it bounces king king king king back and hits him in the fucking finger
[1720.30s -> 1724.94s]  And he's gonna go. Oh shit, and it's gonna be inside. It's you don't have to do anything
[1737.92s -> 1742.98s]  Varying speeds too. That doesn't make any sense. This is one way for my body
[1743.62s -> 1750.91s]  That doesn't make any sense either
[1753.06s -> 1756.50s]  Get over here somebody else
[1756.50s -> 1761.14s]  Or you know what another strategy is and i've used this before too and it really really pisses people off
[1761.78s -> 1766.19s]  Is you just go like this
[1766.19s -> 1769.23s]  You just go back back back back back back back up up up up up up up up up
[1772.58s -> 1775.54s]  Like that, I mean it's gonna make you sick if I keep doing it, but you get the idea
[1776.26s -> 1779.84s]  And then they'll eventually score on themselves
[1780.24s -> 1783.23s]  That's classic. Oh, yeah
[1783.23s -> 1794.96s]  I'm the you hold on. I am reaching that far
[1797.33s -> 1799.33s]  That seems like too far to reach
[1802.50s -> 1828.72s]  Why is it a yo-yo? I'm not doing the strategy. It's not working. That's a new game idea. That'd be really dangerous
[1828.80s -> 1830.32s]  I don't think that'd be safe
[1830.32s -> 1836.83s]  I'm gonna get hurt
[1836.83s -> 1838.83s]  You know what? I also think too
[1838.83s -> 1842.03s]  I also think that these paddles should be heavy
[1842.59s -> 1844.19s]  They should be weighted
[1844.19s -> 1846.69s]  and i'll tell you one reason why
[1846.69s -> 1850.45s]  the amount of people that get on these machines and act like absolute assholes
[1851.17s -> 1855.01s]  And just swing as hard as they can and smash this shit across the arcade
[1855.97s -> 1858.27s]  if these things were like
[1858.35s -> 1860.43s]  seven to if they were like ten pounds
[1861.31s -> 1866.11s]  And you had to like drag them around and actually you couldn't like swing like crazy and knock it off the thing
[1869.82s -> 1872.11s]  And they should be attached
[1872.11s -> 1874.11s]  These should be attached to here
[1875.78s -> 1879.06s]  This should be on a track. That's literally here like this
[1879.78s -> 1881.78s]  And it should weigh like fucking five pounds
[1892.91s -> 1895.39s]  Just make it. Yeah, and somebody is every two other people
[1896.43s -> 1898.43s]  No way. I have to let me rephrase that
[1899.33s -> 1900.69s]  It should be
[1900.69s -> 1901.97s]  tethered
[1901.97s -> 1905.17s]  To a wire or something that can only move like this far
[1906.13s -> 1911.97s]  Right. So not like a track but on a tether so it can move like this, right?
[1912.77s -> 1917.33s]  On a wire or whatever the tether it has to be on and it needs to weigh like at least a few pounds
[1917.97s -> 1923.79s]  Are you losing to a little kid?
[1923.79s -> 1926.61s]  I'm barely even playing the game. I'm explaining how to make this game better
[1927.25s -> 1933.50s]  I think I've mentioned this before but uh, you know lying on top of one of these things
[1933.50s -> 1936.54s]  Just letting the air hit every fucking pore of your body. That's like
[1937.74s -> 1939.18s]  I like want that
[1939.18s -> 1940.70s]  I want a
[1940.70s -> 1943.18s]  Um air hockey table in my house not to play it
[1943.90s -> 1945.90s]  To be have to be a relaxation zone
[1946.30s -> 1948.96s]  Is that weird?
[1948.96s -> 1957.92s]  Let me say that in the middle of like the hottest days of summer when it's 110 115 plus degrees here
[1958.90s -> 1960.90s]  lying on top of one of these and having
[1961.38s -> 1964.18s]  Hundreds of little air jets hit you in every corner of your body
[1967.14s -> 1981.62s]  I wouldn't even play this thing
[1981.62s -> 1984.19s]  And get one just take a shower
[1991.36s -> 1996.75s]  But I don't want to get wet. I don't know who's winning right now. I can't even tell
[2001.33s -> 2006.48s]  Is this supposed to be a little kid?
[2006.48s -> 2008.48s]  I'm talking about your fetishes
[2020.24s -> 2022.24s]  That's very specific
[2024.03s -> 2028.35s]  Yeah, I see what happens is I get off to uh lying on my back on an air hockey table
[2028.99s -> 2031.36s]  I'm letting the air hit me in the back
[2032.19s -> 2036.59s]  Good luck finding pornography for that. There's probably three videos on the internet where that happens
[2038.30s -> 2041.26s]  You know, you're not gonna you're gonna have to cycle before like two videos
[2059.44s -> 2061.44s]  You could just corner the market
[2067.09s -> 2070.29s]  I don't I don't think there's very large market for that
[2073.73s -> 2076.37s]  If you're talking about uh, like a business expense for yourself
[2077.09s -> 2079.73s]  I'm not sure you would ever recoup the cost of the table
[2095.52s -> 2098.24s]  Does anybody else think this is getting a little ridiculous that this is still going?
[2101.47s -> 2107.15s]  And I have to admit this happens when I play regular ice hockey not ice hockey, uh table hockey
[2107.15s -> 2109.81s]  What the hell is this called?
[2109.81s -> 2115.57s]  After about five minutes neither person wants to play anymore, but nobody wants to back away because this was four dollars
[2120.46s -> 2125.20s]  I won I just kicked his ass
[2126.69s -> 2133.84s]  That's pretty good tickets
[2133.84s -> 2137.28s]  I am not kidding. I have left games without being completed
[2139.44s -> 2144.80s]  There have been people waiting to play air hockey sort of another like couple group or kids or something that I and
[2145.36s -> 2147.36s]  And i've gotten like two to two
[2147.60s -> 2149.60s]  Like one to three or something versus somebody
[2150.16s -> 2152.54s]  And we just leave
[2152.54s -> 2155.02s]  Like oh that was fun. I know you guys can just take it
[2158.13s -> 2160.21s]  I actually in fact will say I think air hockey
[2161.09s -> 2162.13s]  is
[2162.13s -> 2166.85s]  The worst thing that's in the arcades because it takes up so much space and I find it to be
[2167.25s -> 2169.25s]  After five minutes a game. I don't want to play anymore
[2169.73s -> 2172.03s]  Like not even two minutes
[2183.28s -> 2185.28s]  I would rather there be
[2186.13s -> 2190.91s]  I want more games like video games and not just the same video game
[2191.23s -> 2197.04s]  Where they give you a machine gun a plastic machine gun to fire at aliens. I'm sick of those, too
[2197.44s -> 2206.02s]  arcades nowadays have seriously become like 10 plastic machine gun shooters 10 car games and then a bunch of like
[2206.50s -> 2217.15s]  Coin pushers was the mortal combat
[2218.59s -> 2220.59s]  They tuck that shit in the corner
[2220.67s -> 2225.71s]  Where's turtles in time they put that stuff in like the jokey retro section where there's three cabinets
[2227.07s -> 2236.77s]  They're covered in dust. Nobody plays them air hockey's fun game
[2239.01s -> 2242.05s]  I don't get I don't know. I think it's uh, I think it's taking up too much space too much space
[2242.61s -> 2253.34s]  Go to a retro arcade. Yeah, but those are so few and far between
[2261.74s -> 2266.56s]  I think it's fun, but please remove it from all arcades
[2266.56s -> 2270.72s]  I didn't say remove i'm just talking about there's usually like four or five of them
[2271.71s -> 2276.27s]  That take up the a huge amount of real estate because you have to have a huge amount of real estate to put them down
[2276.83s -> 2282.35s]  Then there are these things
[2282.35s -> 2290.56s]  Do you know how many simpsons arcade games could fit just right here?
[2291.62s -> 2292.58s]  eight
[2292.58s -> 2296.42s]  You could fit six arcade cabinets one, two, three, four fives
[2302.72s -> 2313.90s]  How am I supposed to get it down all the golf balls are in the way
[2322.21s -> 2325.09s]  Dave and busters is all that we have. Yeah, I think that kind of
[2327.15s -> 2330.43s]  I don't know. Here's the weird thing about arcades nowadays
[2332.82s -> 2334.82s]  Is all these companies bait
[2335.30s -> 2337.30s]  everybody now with nostalgia
[2337.70s -> 2342.90s]  Yet no one will make an arcade that has the old games in it and then really have it be like a big business
[2344.50s -> 2347.24s]  Like they just pull on all of our nostalgia heartstrings
[2348.64s -> 2352.78s]  But they won't put any of these like old cool arcade games
[2355.06s -> 2357.14s]  Dave and busters is just like
[2357.14s -> 2359.14s]  The same this kind of shit everywhere
[2363.17s -> 2368.93s]  There's there. Yeah, they exist but it's maybe one in one every major city maybe has one
[2369.89s -> 2373.70s]  maybe
[2373.70s -> 2376.18s]  Round one does do it round one does it to an extent?
[2376.74s -> 2383.60s]  But I really do kind of miss just like the old just arcade games where you just the cabinets
[2384.69s -> 2386.53s]  You just played a game
[2386.53s -> 2389.57s]  And you had to put you know coins in for lives and stuff. I miss that
[2398.30s -> 2400.06s]  Arcades are the way to go
[2400.06s -> 2402.05s]  That's true
[2402.05s -> 2406.46s]  That's true. I'm just trying to get these golf balls out of the way
[2407.10s -> 2411.36s]  There's not a market for it anymore
[2411.36s -> 2414.96s]  Yeah, but that's my that's that's my point though. There's not a market for it anymore yet
[2416.30s -> 2418.78s]  They keep remaking video games and movies and stuff
[2419.26s -> 2423.58s]  I think there is it's just nobody really wants to put the time and money into doing it
[2428.75s -> 2438.80s]  I so badly want this fidget spinner old arcade cabinets are hard to maintain
[2441.49s -> 2443.57s]  Yeah, i'm just a salty old person
[2450.72s -> 2452.72s]  I will get this before I turn the stream off
[2453.14s -> 2454.34s]  I promise
[2454.34s -> 2458.94s]  In fact, i'm getting it right now
[2458.94s -> 2465.44s]  No, i'm going too far up. I'm convinced anime conventions have big arcades
[2466.16s -> 2468.08s]  I remember
[2468.08s -> 2473.20s]  I think like some of the packs at some point had this old retro arcade room
[2473.76s -> 2476.38s]  It was awesome
[2476.38s -> 2481.26s]  It was like 50 cabinets old like donkey kong like joust and all that stuff. It was so cool
[2481.98s -> 2486.66s]  And that might be it
[2486.66s -> 2491.39s]  There it is
[2491.39s -> 2494.43s]  Hold on a little longer stuff swinging around so much. Yeah
[2496.14s -> 2497.58s]  All right, let's go
[2497.58s -> 2513.39s]  Where is it? Um, where's my fidget spinner? It was just five dollars
[2514.03s -> 2526.77s]  Oh, what's this? What is this time score? I have to shoot like a water cannon. This is cool
[2532.74s -> 2541.66s]  What boat am I what am I supposed to do pick up the
[2543.52s -> 2550.82s]  Oh, okay. I have to pick these up
[2550.82s -> 2552.82s]  Oh boy. I have no idea where I am
[2556.69s -> 2561.46s]  earn
[2561.46s -> 2567.71s]  I'm blue in the corner. This is cool
[2578.82s -> 2583.14s]  I love those old midway games too. We have to spray the water into the hole
[2583.94s -> 2594.27s]  If I was ever a billionaire I would just I would probably lose 50 000 a day on this project
[2595.23s -> 2598.75s]  I would love to just have a huge awesome arcade that had so much of this stuff
[2599.55s -> 2606.43s]  All the old classics just like a hundred plus old, uh retro arcade cabinets all the old stuff remembers
[2607.23s -> 2612.10s]  I would probably just lose money every day
[2612.50s -> 2627.36s]  I can't tell even what direction I am. Can I turn around?
[2632.08s -> 2637.78s]  Rent out an arcade instead
[2637.78s -> 2641.54s]  Say toy boat toy boat toy boat that was cell phone did
[2642.18s -> 2648.85s]  Honestly, the way that that boat over on the left was I thought it was spongebob in the water
[2655.62s -> 2657.62s]  Vegas is probably the place to do that
[2659.23s -> 2667.23s]  That was cool. I got tickets for that. How do I get off?
[2667.87s -> 2673.31s]  Oh, that's a lot. It's 600 tickets
[2680.53s -> 2689.20s]  Did that one? I got that one. I beat that one. This minute did I oh this mini golf
[2689.44s -> 2691.44s]  I don't think I did mini golf. Did I?
[2691.95s -> 2696.96s]  Last time I played it
[2696.96s -> 2700.24s]  I got I've got to put all the new viewers. I gotta impress the hell out of them, right?
[2701.82s -> 2703.82s]  How could I not impress the new viewers with this?
[2717.82s -> 2723.70s]  You know when I got this it was like five or six times in a row
[2729.73s -> 2738.93s]  Ah, come on this was the ayaya game. Yes it was
[2741.89s -> 2745.41s]  I gotta get it twice in a row
[2752.10s -> 2763.96s]  Come on apologize apologize apologize apologize. I am so sorry. I am so sorry
[2770.03s -> 2774.14s]  What was this what I just got distracted get out of here
[2777.73s -> 2784.18s]  Come on three times in a row
[2792.93s -> 2795.09s]  Oh, I forgot about this you can just keep going
[2796.05s -> 2801.14s]  Let's try to crash the whole game and just try to fill this entire arcade with tickets until like everybody has to run out
[2803.04s -> 2809.18s]  This is really loud. You're right. It is
[2814.94s -> 2835.95s]  Now what what's going on here? Come on. What happened to the organ game?
[2836.96s -> 2838.96s]  Um, I got two endings
[2841.28s -> 2842.77s]  and
[2842.77s -> 2845.58s]  I thought it was a really fun game
[2845.66s -> 2848.54s]  But I realized that coin game had an update I didn't know about
[2849.34s -> 2851.98s]  And now chat was very very, uh excited about it
[2852.78s -> 2854.78s]  Incredibly excited about this update
[2855.76s -> 2858.40s]  So I was like, you know what fine we'll play this too
[2860.80s -> 2863.12s]  Organ dev. Thank you on twitter. It was really sweet that game was
[2863.92s -> 2865.84s]  Very very very fun
[2865.84s -> 2869.62s]  That was like I would give that at least
[2870.26s -> 2874.66s]  I mean something high that was fucking really good. I might play it again on my own time
[2875.46s -> 2880.96s]  He got bullied into playing coin game
[2886.82s -> 2888.82s]  This game is really fun too
[2888.90s -> 2892.43s]  There it is. Finally. All right, I got three
[2897.36s -> 2900.35s]  All right one more
[2900.35s -> 2910.37s]  One more jackpot and i'm done
[2910.37s -> 2918.94s]  Come on one more. Come on
[2920.45s -> 2922.45s]  You gotta play dizzy bird. I'll play dizzy bird
[2924.00s -> 2928.48s]  I've lost my magic here
[2928.48s -> 2940.38s]  There we go. Don't break my shit
[2951.46s -> 2967.58s]  So much dopamine. There really is dopamine. I'll play this one too. This one new. It's not bad
[2968.60s -> 2970.60s]  2500s on there too. Holy crap
[2970.62s -> 2980.13s]  I never play these when I go to the arcade. They feel too random
[2980.45s -> 2992.59s]  I feel like I have no control over what's going on right now. The organ game actually updated for you
[2993.39s -> 3002.11s]  No, they did not the organ trader dev actually updated the game to spite chat what
[3004.43s -> 3014.22s]  No, they didn't hold on. What was the update?
[3015.71s -> 3023.42s]  No joke. Hold on. What what what was the twitter again? I just I just
[3024.06s -> 3034.69s]  Moved out. I just closed out of the window. Oh, hey chat. You got proof
[3038.38s -> 3063.73s]  Okay. Okay. What was the update? He said I do not fuck around update queued. Wait, hold on. This is this is actually hilarious
[3070.18s -> 3087.23s]  Okay, let me read this he found his connect he read the tweets live on stream like my parents on christmas
[3087.63s -> 3096.86s]  Nerma putting even more cash into x cormac's remnants to drive down his average price paid and justified in his investment with a big
[3096.86s -> 3106.26s]  Meme face he gets it portions of the chat kept asking for a different game
[3106.26s -> 3110.82s]  So often that he switched to emote only so they'd shut the fuck up and he could concentrate on trading organs
[3111.14s -> 3114.02s]  That might be the best endorsement i've seen of the game so far. Holy shit
[3118.50s -> 3121.30s]  He was holding his urine for four hours to keep playing
[3127.46s -> 3133.38s]  Building and uploading a new steam version specifically so that the chat isn't gaslighting germa about a new
[3134.02s -> 3147.89s]  Update anymore. Are you kidding me? This is that's that's actually hilarious
[3152.21s -> 3153.57s]  one guy
[3153.57s -> 3159.34s]  In this chat said hey dude, go back. They updated organ trading simulator lol
[3159.66s -> 3167.36s]  It's like aha. That's funny. They they go and update it and like you you actually were correct about that
[3167.76s -> 3177.22s]  That's a pretty huge one guy moment just to spite the chat. That's that's more. There's an update actually queued for it
[3177.22s -> 3182.96s]  That's so funny
[3182.96s -> 3186.22s]  That's too funny
[3186.22s -> 3188.46s]  Well, they said thanks for playing the game. I mean the game's great
[3189.10s -> 3193.74s]  You should be you should be uh, very proud of what you've made. It's very fun
[3194.38s -> 3210.67s]  Give me my cards back. I like playing these. These are fun. Did I get the bonus?
[3214.35s -> 3219.23s]  I always like to I queue up the coins. I don't like doing one and then wait. I just at the arcade I go one
[3220.05s -> 3221.01s]  two
[3221.09s -> 3230.61s]  Three or bonus five bonus six bonus seven bonus, right? Then you stop see I got i'm throwing off
[3235.49s -> 3251.81s]  Where's dizzy bird? I want to play dizzy bird after this. Okay. Well, I that was I think the game was broken. That was weird
[3252.77s -> 3261.20s]  Oh, give me this
[3261.36s -> 3265.78s]  Flying around this place
[3265.94s -> 3268.10s]  Why am I larping here? What am I doing?
[3271.79s -> 3274.29s]  We
[3274.37s -> 3278.99s]  Yay
[3278.99s -> 3281.07s]  Let me put the oh
[3281.07s -> 3296.86s]  I remember watching the critical video where he just literally won this every single time
[3297.87s -> 3332.43s]  The videos that video is actually like an s video s plus first try. Let's go. How much is that 2 000 tickets?
[3332.51s -> 3333.47s]  I'll take them
[3333.47s -> 3341.89s]  You have to understand something. I watched that I watched that critical video. I can beat this every time
[3342.29s -> 3350.22s]  I think these are new. I don't remember these being here
[3356.69s -> 3358.69s]  They left and yeah, this is definitely new stuff
[3359.82s -> 3361.20s]  and I
[3361.20s -> 3383.54s]  What networking andy? I said I was a fan of critical's videos
[3385.18s -> 3389.26s]  That's not networking any that's that's recognizing a good content creator
[3413.34s -> 3422.26s]  Pinball machine drops frames. That's all right. It's fine. Oh my god. Why do those exist?
[3424.46s -> 3429.18s]  Biggest scam in the pinball industry ever is having that spot on the left and right where the ball just drops down
[3429.26s -> 3438.85s]  It's so dumb the pinball game is supposed to be about skill and what the hell is the point of those?
[3446.99s -> 3449.07s]  There's nothing fun about the left and right traps
[3449.73s -> 3453.76s]  Nothing nothing fun about
[3453.84s -> 3458.00s]  Pinball in general like I don't even know why I play it because the game it's literally why would I play pinball?
[3462.90s -> 3472.61s]  Oh, what what is this space invaders?
[3480.74s -> 3487.82s]  This is so cool. The dev of this game seriously put so much time into this
[3489.60s -> 3494.16s]  What are they like up like 60 or 70 machines now to play maybe more. I don't even know
[3494.16s -> 3495.68s]  There's a lot in this game
[3495.68s -> 3501.10s]  This is like the fourth plus I think fourth or fifth time i've played this on stream. Just keep adding stuff
[3509.25s -> 3524.66s]  I'll get it. I'll get it. I got it. All right, come on these little popcorns
[3524.66s -> 3537.06s]  What are they do mini golf? Yeah, i'll do mini golf after this. I can I forgot this
[3537.06s -> 3541.18s]  I thought this is a different day and I was under the desk with that hair
[3541.42s -> 3557.97s]  I thought that was four days ago. All right, you gotta use defense here. Oh shit. All right, I lost
[3562.83s -> 3581.26s]  Now I don't want to play this anymore get in. Uh
[3581.98s -> 3594.05s]  What do I think this is? What what? Oh, no, i'm trapped in here. I can't grab anything. What's wrong with my arms?
[3596.43s -> 3640.93s]  What let us peep the horror. Oh, i'm busy the third time i've said that today, isn't it? All right
[3640.93s -> 3646.56s]  Cool. What else is here? That's new. Ooh
[3650.16s -> 3666.67s]  Oh shit, all right. I get it. You just don't want to get it in the big ones. Okay, I say I want to spin
[3666.75s -> 3692.30s]  Hell, yeah, let's go. What do I get? Give me the whole 3000. That's all right. It's not bad. That's not bad
[3692.46s -> 3703.57s]  It's not bad. I think that one was here. These three definitely were not this shit
[3704.13s -> 3719.97s]  Not this again. I was obsessed with this now. This is the children's roulette. Yeah, I had it wrong
[3729.74s -> 3740.91s]  I'm not gonna spend time here. Don't worry. I'm out. I'll do mini golf. Should I count my tickets?
[3740.91s -> 3753.50s]  How many tickets do I have? What is the ticket counting machine? All right mini golf
[3755.49s -> 3774.19s]  Uh, i'll play 18 holes that might be way too much. Oh boy. That's probably I made a mistake nice vans
[3774.59s -> 3791.39s]  Hey, thanks the depart too. All right, let's go. It's out hole in one hole in one or I will gift 10
[3794.66s -> 3796.72s]  Dollars
[3796.72s -> 3819.09s]  Lotto or a new toy. All right hole in one right here. I will never mind. Those are the real stakes
[3819.33s -> 3824.74s]  Does anybody else not have the patience for mini golf at all?
[3830.67s -> 3839.89s]  There's nothing in this world that infuriates me more than this game because once you go over three or four strokes
[3840.21s -> 3847.04s]  You just get pissed and kind of embarrassed
[3847.04s -> 3869.39s]  Especially if your ball bounces out the play field and then you end up just dragging the ball over into the I used to
[3869.39s -> 3870.99s]  Hate mini golf. I really did
[3870.99s -> 3876.34s]  It's kind of weird because I really don't like mini golf and I don't like bowling either
[3877.33s -> 3892.38s]  I just get frustrated and annoyed and impatient bowling is sick dude. I trust me. I know I like watching good bowlers
[3892.38s -> 3913.49s]  I don't like to bowl myself. I just can't this one. You want to go on the right side? Come on, really?
[3924.61s -> 3937.86s]  That's it right there. That would have been great too hard. See right now my lips just went like this
[3938.18s -> 3955.74s]  Okay, if i'm if i'm actually in the mini golf place, my mouth just went like this that happens like my lips go
[3955.82s -> 3963.20s]  Mm-hmm go right up here
[3963.20s -> 3968.86s]  Okay
[3968.86s -> 3975.82s]  If I get a hole in one at any point during this course and i'm gonna eat a pepperoni pizza tonight
[3978.24s -> 3981.87s]  If not, then it's all salads. We're talking kale
[3982.75s -> 3984.27s]  spinach
[3984.27s -> 3986.05s]  radishes
[3986.05s -> 3989.97s]  So maybe some red onion. No, I I want a hole in one i'm gonna get a pepperoni pizza
[3990.21s -> 4005.87s]  Or have to eat a gross salad. Oh, I was gonna say it's pizza tonight
[4008.24s -> 4021.20s]  No, I don't want to eat a salad. I like salads, but I don't want one for dinner. You are so dumb
[4021.44s -> 4038.78s]  Why would I go with it?
[4038.78s -> 4048.03s]  Salad night tonight and it's looking more and more like a salad night. This is my chance
[4048.03s -> 4055.44s]  This is yeah, this is my chance right at the end right there. That'll do it
[4057.10s -> 4066.69s]  Oh, no
[4066.69s -> 4079.95s]  It doesn't want to eat vegetables golf sucks. I hate this sport so much. You know, it just it
[4080.57s -> 4089.63s]  Perplexes me it intrigues me. I don't I don't want to play this. All right, you want to have a round of golf? No
[4090.69s -> 4097.41s]  No, like can't we play frisbee?
[4097.65s -> 4099.25s]  That sounds like more fun
[4099.25s -> 4104.99s]  I don't want to play golf once you hit like 35 years old or like 30
[4105.39s -> 4116.22s]  It's almost like you're supposed to like this. I don't and it's treated so
[4117.02s -> 4119.50s]  Like oh my god, it's the best. It's so much fun. It's so incredible
[4119.58s -> 4123.57s]  I don't like I don't want to walk around and chase balls
[4123.97s -> 4132.98s]  I don't want to take like a big drive into the ball slice across it. No
[4137.30s -> 4140.02s]  It takes so long. It takes an entire day to play
[4140.42s -> 4150.46s]  It takes way too long to play and you can't play three rounds. You can't do three holes people be like
[4150.62s -> 4156.11s]  No, I want to do nine. Let's do nine. By the way, let's wake up at four o'clock in the morning
[4157.89s -> 4167.94s]  What are you doing? It's like everything I hate about the whole universe wake up wicked early
[4169.41s -> 4174.02s]  Walk around like miles and
[4174.74s -> 4176.74s]  Swing and try to hit a tiny little thing
[4177.14s -> 4178.98s]  It's like all my least favorite things in the world
[4178.98s -> 4196.83s]  I don't like anything about it anything about it. Why is your name gas can easy to remember that counts
[4196.83s -> 4212.75s]  I get pizza that counts. I get pepperoni pizza tonight. I like this a little lightning they're doing here
[4212.91s -> 4230.88s]  I don't mind golf and it's like it's so asmr
[4231.36s -> 4234.08s]  They do like golf is the original asmr
[4234.40s -> 4248.34s]  Looks like he's uh gonna be at the he's in the sandpit here
[4248.91s -> 4254.13s]  See if he can try to get his way out of that one small little swing will do it
[4254.13s -> 4275.30s]  I think why don't they just put the announcers like why is it such a big deal?
[4277.82s -> 4284.06s]  We have people that go up to bat in baseball games in stadiums full of 60 to 70 000 people screaming
[4284.22s -> 4288.98s]  Everybody's gonna be shit. Everybody's gonna be so quiet at the golf course
[4289.38s -> 4291.38s]  He's gonna swing and hit this thing
[4291.38s -> 4295.89s]  They have to swing and hit things in baseball the things that are coming at them 100 miles per hour
[4296.13s -> 4313.09s]  Imagine a stadium for golf that I actually would probably like it a little bit more
[4313.86s -> 4321.95s]  I'm not kidding if there was like a putting competition and everyone was just fucking chugging beers and like freaking out and screaming
[4322.27s -> 4335.84s]  I think that would be so entertaining. I think that'd be so funny mini golf. Why is there not a mini golf?
[4336.86s -> 4357.14s]  Stadium event. I think that would be so awesome. You need oh don't even please don't give me more ideas
[4361.79s -> 4367.46s]  Can you imagine how dumb that would be if there was like a stadium with like 40 000 people in it?
[4367.62s -> 4373.33s]  It was just a mini golf course and the mini and the course was wicked fucked up. It's crazy shit happening
[4373.49s -> 4393.17s]  Let me do baseball first and then we'll see now. I'm obviously just messing around golf is fine
[4393.49s -> 4400.19s]  I just find it to be boring. I mean we got everyone's to be quiet
[4400.51s -> 4411.79s]  Wait, somebody said viva labam did that in 2004. Did they really?
[4415.62s -> 4422.93s]  How do you remember that?
[4422.93s -> 4437.33s]  That's so funny. You're describing. Holy moly
[4438.30s -> 4444.18s]  Wait a minute. I I'm I'm very curious at this point. What is holy moly?
[4447.63s -> 4455.57s]  Holy moly show

[4491.82s -> 4493.82s]  Holy mo is it bam margera?
[4495.30s -> 4501.17s]  Welcome to holy mo. You might think i'm just another celebrity cameo at the what?
[4504.38s -> 4507.42s]  Way more involved in it. They get celebrities to do this
[4510.34s -> 4516.43s]  Maybe sit back and relax. I don't know
[4516.59s -> 4522.27s]  I thought that was a big mac for mcdonald's. I thought there was another ad playing or he was in this or something
[4522.98s -> 4524.98s]  This is holy moly
[4539.34s -> 4541.34s]  I can't believe this is real
[4546.61s -> 4553.89s]  They came in twos from across the land to do mini golf battle one-on-one the most skilled competitors on the planet
[4555.65s -> 4560.66s]  Competing on the most epic mini golf course. Oh my god, you gotta be kidding me
[4561.62s -> 4571.50s]  For glory, why do they have to do this? Why have to go up the aggro crag? What does this have to do with mini golf?
[4584.40s -> 4590.66s]  25 grand it's ninja warrior most extreme elimination challenge wipeout and golf
[4590.98s -> 4594.74s]  And yes, this is literally a mini golf competition and yes
[4595.06s -> 4601.94s]  It's on prime time with an absurd budget, but is this on tv still this is june of 2019 is this trailer?

[4682.03s -> 4696.08s]  Why do you keep doing that? Oh now I want mcdonald's
[4697.17s -> 4699.17s]  Why does all advertising work?
[4704.78s -> 4735.01s]  Don't spray me. I love these little things nice right there get that rat got it. Would it land on 10 bucks?
[4739.58s -> 4744.19s]  I think I got them all

[4761.49s -> 4767.74s]  Uh, I lost my mouse
