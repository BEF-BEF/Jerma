[28.98s -> 40.43s]  Alright, sorry I ruined the birthday. I walked back into the door, and I... I didn't forget that this was here, but I kind of... kind of did.
[40.43s -> 47.47s]  And I walked... I took down the... I walked into the thing that was hanging.
[47.47s -> 58.66s]  Okay, so now that was a ton of fun. I'm really surprised I had that much fun on Roblox.
[58.66s -> 64.66s]  I thought that was going to be like 20 minutes of just like, oh, whatever, let's just play something, or like an hour or something.
[64.66s -> 75.43s]  That was really fun. Yeah, I walked into the banner. I'll show you.
[75.43s -> 85.61s]  Um, let me turn my switch on. What about Five Nights at Freddy's?
[85.61s -> 89.65s]  I think Ster was just tired, and he just was like, taking off.
[89.65s -> 100.21s]  Because it's, uh, yeah, we're late night Andes over here.
[100.21s -> 103.47s]  That's it. We'll do it again. We'll do something else later. That's fine.
[103.47s -> 127.68s]  I want to play that game, uh, with Poke2, the scary one. Let me make sure I am capturing this correctly.
[127.68s -> 139.06s]  One, one sec.
[139.06s -> 150.06s]  They're making a new BNAF movie. Holy shit.
[150.06s -> 156.89s]  Yeah, actually, when I was VRV, Polly was like, I thought you were hot micing.
[156.89s -> 174.41s]  No, I'm just stupid and had my desktop audio muted.
[174.41s -> 183.62s]  Uh, why is my switch not working?
[183.62s -> 190.68s]  Um, is this not even plugged in? Oh, shit. Hold on.
[190.68s -> 295.77s]  Give me one more second. I got to plug. I unplugged the switch for something else.
[295.77s -> 300.90s]  Okay. Wait, did you not hear when I said I was going to leave? Wait, what?
[300.90s -> 303.90s]  I said I had to plug my switch in because it was unplugged.
[303.90s -> 307.92s]  You didn't hear that? Wait, what?
[307.92s -> 314.26s]  My audio is not delayed still, is it? It shouldn't be. That's weird. Okay.
[314.26s -> 328.76s]  Alright, let me just plug my headphones in. You should be able to see it now.
[328.76s -> 337.90s]  Or in a second.
[337.90s -> 356.97s]  Hey, there it is. Uh, let me just plug my actual headphones in.
[381.67s -> 383.67s]  Alright, it's time to play.
[383.67s -> 388.98s]  What was the last thing I did? What did I do last?
[388.98s -> 394.81s]  I do need to do this.
[394.81s -> 397.81s]  And if I'm going to have any face cam, I need to do this.
[397.81s -> 404.90s]  Like this. Hold on.
[404.90s -> 406.90s]  Oh, you want to see the, uh, yeah. Here, I'll show you.
[406.90s -> 422.30s]  Oh, hold on. I fucked it up. Did I fuck it up?
[422.30s -> 432.12s]  Uh, yeah, I accidentally walked into it. I tore it down.
[432.12s -> 436.98s]  I hit my fucking head on the birthday.
[436.98s -> 442.35s]  No, I ducked. I was ducking down. That would mean I was very small.
[442.35s -> 452.70s]  Well, it's okay. Let me fix this because I need to delay this camera.
[452.70s -> 460.60s]  That should do it.
[460.60s -> 466.83s]  Alright, I am officially ready to play Breath of the Wild.
[466.83s -> 485.31s]  Happy. And get...
[485.31s -> 489.64s]  Rip the decorations down when you fuck a puzzle up?
[489.64s -> 498.50s]  Alright, this is the last Divine Beast.
[498.50s -> 505.05s]  But I don't want to do that right now. I think I want to do...
[505.05s -> 520.05s]  What are some side... There's, like, the trials, right?
[520.05s -> 528.18s]  Should I do those? Go get your horse? Bottom right.
[528.18s -> 544.10s]  Am I going to play Minecraft again?
[544.10s -> 546.10s]  There's an island with a really cool side quest down here.
[546.10s -> 563.92s]  Check it out. Ignored? What happened?
[563.92s -> 571.78s]  What did I ignore? Ignore what?
[571.78s -> 576.81s]  Oh, the horse. That's right. I'm imagining it's probably over here.
[576.81s -> 580.37s]  Not the horse, but this... Is this the island down here you're talking about?
[580.37s -> 583.37s]  Ooh, there is an island down... Wait, I was here before.
[583.37s -> 586.63s]  Isn't there, like, a big troll here?
[586.63s -> 599.82s]  Is this a stupid thing I'm doing?
[599.82s -> 628.54s]  I think I'm going to make it. I think I'll be alright.
[628.54s -> 629.54s]  I have stamina drinks.
[629.54s -> 633.82s]  Can you finally sing Happy Birthday?
[633.82s -> 636.32s]  Yeah, I said I wasn't, but fine.
[636.32s -> 639.32s]  Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you.
[639.32s -> 642.32s]  Happy birthday to... Whoever you're watching.
[642.32s -> 644.32s]  Whoever's watching, right? And you distracted me.
[644.32s -> 660.83s]  And you just probably got me killed.
[660.83s -> 663.14s]  How do I get down there?
[663.14s -> 668.77s]  Do I just have to make it with stamina?
[668.77s -> 672.86s]  I need stamina potions.
[672.86s -> 673.86s]  I think I have some, don't I?
[673.86s -> 685.37s]  Nah, this is haste.
[685.37s -> 686.37s]  Is there any stamina food?
[686.37s -> 691.10s]  I need a boat. Stamina potions.
[691.10s -> 703.03s]  Maybe I can't do it yet. Stealth. Cook a durian.
[703.03s -> 710.46s]  Well, I definitely can't do it yet.
[710.46s -> 712.78s]  There's a boat to your left.
[712.78s -> 719.42s]  Ooh, wait a minute. Over there?
[719.42s -> 728.79s]  Yeah, I think I remember that.
[728.79s -> 731.74s]  Actually, I can make this too, right?
[731.74s -> 740.06s]  I can teleport to the shrine. What am I doing?
[740.06s -> 750.46s]  My mom said you made her day by playing Roblox.
[750.46s -> 755.22s]  It was fun. That was some of the most fun I've had on stream, I think, in...
[755.22s -> 759.21s]  I don't know. It's been, like, a month or two. That was awesome.
[759.21s -> 761.96s]  That was just super fun, super funny.
[761.96s -> 773.98s]  There we go. Ooh, wait.
[773.98s -> 781.59s]  I need a leaf or something, don't I?
[781.59s -> 793.22s]  Isn't there usually, like, a leaf? What was that?
[793.22s -> 802.63s]  Cut a tree down? Oh, there it is.
[802.63s -> 812.45s]  I'm going to drop. What should I drop?
[812.45s -> 815.84s]  I'm dropping this. I can get it later.
[815.84s -> 823.50s]  Drop the Master Sword? That would be awful.
[823.50s -> 829.23s]  I'm going to turn that thing back on.
[829.23s -> 831.23s]  This is to get one of those seeds.
[831.23s -> 849.71s]  Hurry up! Got it.
[849.71s -> 861.79s]  Yeah, I need way more of these.
[861.79s -> 866.02s]  All right, that's the destination, right?
[866.02s -> 885.02s]  What the hell am I doing?
[886.39s -> 889.40s]  Okay, turn it.
[892.22s -> 895.35s]  What a gamer.
[898.17s -> 900.47s]  All right, so what did I do wrong?
[900.47s -> 906.84s]  Oh, I thought...
[906.84s -> 910.74s]  He's throwing rocks at me.
[910.74s -> 920.55s]  Is there still an after party going on at the fashion contest?
[920.55s -> 924.20s]  That's the... I love it.
[924.20s -> 926.20s]  After party.
[926.20s -> 929.02s]  All right.
[929.02s -> 942.25s]  So, even tied up.
[942.25s -> 947.61s]  All right.
[947.61s -> 949.61s]  So, even tied island.
[949.61s -> 954.15s]  You who has traveled to this island,
[954.15s -> 959.91s]  I present you the challenge.
[959.91s -> 961.91s]  In your travels, you've relied on the equipment...
[961.91s -> 963.91s]  Oh, that's right. It takes all your equipment and shit.
[963.91s -> 977.67s]  Offer up the orbs to the three altars on the island,
[977.67s -> 979.67s]  only them you... Okay.
[979.67s -> 984.52s]  So, three orbs.
[984.52s -> 994.76s]  All right. Is it puzzle stuff in this?
[994.76s -> 997.32s]  Oh, it's going in E mode only? Oh, no.
[997.32s -> 1001.66s]  Uh...
[1001.66s -> 1003.66s]  Yeah, it's a big puzzle, isn't it?
[1003.66s -> 1009.29s]  All right. We're good. We're good. We're good.
[1009.29s -> 1020.42s]  I got a stick.
[1020.42s -> 1027.14s]  Oh, I don't have a bow. Shit.
[1027.14s -> 1039.67s]  Bananas.
[1039.67s -> 1042.74s]  30 minutes?
[1042.74s -> 1044.74s]  This is not going to take 10 minutes?
[1044.74s -> 1056.58s]  You're saying 30 minutes?
[1056.58s -> 1070.02s]  There's an axe right there.
[1070.02s -> 1083.34s]  I didn't even fucking jump.
[1083.34s -> 1093.38s]  Okay. Woodcutter's axe.
[1093.38s -> 1095.38s]  All right. So, I'm going to cut down some trees.
[1095.38s -> 1110.09s]  Okay.
[1110.09s -> 1116.14s]  Wood. Okay.
[1116.14s -> 1125.99s]  I probably need a bunch of wood.
[1125.99s -> 1138.33s]  I got three wood.
[1138.33s -> 1141.70s]  I don't think I have any... I don't want to die.
[1141.70s -> 1143.70s]  Ooh. Okay. Good. I still have this.
[1143.70s -> 1147.42s]  Should I eat the bananas or should I cook the bananas?
[1147.42s -> 1149.42s]  Probably cook, right? Yeah. All right.
[1149.42s -> 1152.55s]  I'm going to cook. Wait. I need something to light it.
[1152.55s -> 1157.99s]  No. No, no, no. I need something to light it.
[1157.99s -> 1183.64s]  I could fight these guys.
[1183.64s -> 1195.85s]  Shit. That's a lot of
[1195.85s -> 1197.85s]  nose. You guys don't think I can do it?
[1197.85s -> 1200.86s]  That's a ton of...
[1200.86s -> 1205.78s]  That's way too many nose.
[1205.78s -> 1208.92s]  I got it. All right. Here's one.
[1208.92s -> 1219.99s]  Ooh. Bow. Good. Soldier's bow.
[1219.99s -> 1226.50s]  What?
[1226.50s -> 1239.69s]  Okay. I got one.
[1239.69s -> 1242.12s]  I need three. What do I bring
[1242.12s -> 1246.60s]  these? Wait. There's a fire right here.
[1246.60s -> 1259.91s]  All right. Should I cook individual
[1259.91s -> 1270.73s]  bananas? Roasted mighty
[1270.73s -> 1273.86s]  banana. It doesn't do anything. How is
[1273.86s -> 1275.86s]  that any better than a regular
[1275.86s -> 1283.99s]  banana? Okay. Let's do this.
[1283.99s -> 1286.81s]  A couple bananas.
[1286.81s -> 1290.14s]  This should be pretty good.
[1290.14s -> 1295.96s]  Wait. It's not a stove. Pick it
[1295.96s -> 1297.96s]  all up. Oh, shit.
[1297.96s -> 1305.45s]  It's not a stove.
[1305.45s -> 1313.43s]  Okay.
[1313.43s -> 1324.28s]  Okay.
[1324.28s -> 1335.35s]  What do I take this?
[1335.35s -> 1353.64s]  Isn't it up? All right. I'm going to go up.
[1353.64s -> 1358.89s]  I think it's actually up. I'm
[1358.89s -> 1360.89s]  90% certain that it's on one of the mountains.
[1360.89s -> 1364.34s]  No, no, no. Wait. There's one
[1364.34s -> 1374.07s]  kind of on the beach, right?
[1374.07s -> 1376.25s]  Please don't wake up.
[1376.25s -> 1389.16s]  Why did you let
[1389.16s -> 1391.16s]  go of it? Why did I let go of it?
[1391.16s -> 1403.56s]  What? All right.
[1403.56s -> 1418.28s]  I need this. Right there.
[1418.28s -> 1421.29s]  I need to just despawn this guy.
[1421.29s -> 1429.29s]  All right. Get out of here. Get the fuck out of here.
[1429.29s -> 1437.78s]  Okay.
[1437.78s -> 1457.67s]  You can't run with this. How are they so
[1457.67s -> 1468.42s]  accurate? This is going to unlock
[1468.42s -> 1484.36s]  something, probably, right? I hope so.
[1484.36s -> 1486.73s]  Why are you laughing at me? It's not funny yet.
[1486.73s -> 1489.35s]  It's not funny yet.
[1489.35s -> 1499.45s]  Okay. Hold on.
[1499.45s -> 1507.38s]  Shit. I'm terrified
[1507.38s -> 1530.73s]  of this. Can I
[1530.73s -> 1540.78s]  golf it over there?
[1540.78s -> 1547.69s]  Am I going to lose it if I go in here with this?
[1547.69s -> 1554.73s]  I am, aren't I? No?
[1554.73s -> 1556.73s]  Wait. I'm not going to. I won't lose it.
[1556.73s -> 1561.08s]  This is very conflicting.
[1561.08s -> 1563.08s]  I don't know what to do.
[1563.08s -> 1607.80s]  I have an idea. All right.
[1607.80s -> 1611.64s]  I'm not supposed to do it like this. I'm just
[1611.64s -> 1613.64s]  going to go for it and whatever happens happens because I'm just
[1613.64s -> 1615.64s]  going to test and see if this is even possible.
[1615.64s -> 1621.51s]  Am I going to lose this shit?
[1621.51s -> 1623.51s]  No. This is bad. This is a bad idea.
[1623.51s -> 1629.53s]  Is there another spot on the map
[1629.53s -> 1634.33s]  where one of those is?
[1634.33s -> 1636.33s]  Don't even do that.
[1636.33s -> 1643.10s]  Rebranch?
[1643.10s -> 1650.39s]  I'm so paranoid just to walk over there
[1650.39s -> 1657.30s]  with it. I probably can just
[1657.30s -> 1659.48s]  walk over there. Whatever.
[1659.48s -> 1669.98s]  People are going to laugh at me. It's fine.
[1669.98s -> 1671.98s]  Okay. I didn't lose it though. I had the right
[1671.98s -> 1679.91s]  idea. I thought it was going to disappear.
[1679.91s -> 1688.10s]  Yeah. I was just paranoid that it wasn't going to go away.
[1688.10s -> 1690.10s]  Like it was just going to disappear.
[1690.10s -> 1715.24s]  Let's go. All right. There's
[1715.24s -> 1725.72s]  one. What does that do?
[1725.72s -> 1729.11s]  Okay. So I got
[1729.11s -> 1731.11s]  I just put free in there and I'm good.
[1731.11s -> 1741.27s]  What is happening? Thank God.
[1741.27s -> 1743.27s]  I just did that. That would have been a
[1743.27s -> 1747.62s]  disaster. Okay.
[1747.62s -> 1749.93s]  There are two more balls on the island.
[1749.93s -> 1757.93s]  Got to find them. That was almost
[1757.93s -> 1779.37s]  frame perfect. I'm going to have to kill
[1779.37s -> 1784.36s]  that thing, aren't I, eventually? I'm going up.
[1784.36s -> 1788.26s]  I know there's another one up there. I remember
[1788.26s -> 1796.52s]  seeing it. So the play is just don't
[1796.52s -> 1798.52s]  aggro the big guy, right?
[1798.52s -> 1805.16s]  That's what I would think.
[1805.16s -> 1818.79s]  Oh shit. There's another one.
[1818.79s -> 1828.12s]  Oh.
[1828.12s -> 1845.13s]  It'll get solid.
[1845.13s -> 1851.85s]  Do they notice this?
[1851.85s -> 1869.82s]  Ah! How do I move this?
[1869.82s -> 1906.86s]  Wait. Will that, does that actually work?
[1906.86s -> 1911.21s]  That's going to get struck by lightning, right?
[1911.21s -> 1955.03s]  Do I have to have it equipped? How do I get this
[1955.03s -> 1962.07s]  to strike? Come on.
[1962.07s -> 1965.27s]  I don't even know who I'm walking onto.
[1984.28s -> 1987.46s]  Go. Come on.
[1987.46s -> 2012.68s]  Where's the flurry? You got
[2012.68s -> 2016.14s]  to be fucking kidding me, dude. Can I
[2016.14s -> 2020.30s]  stand up here? There's a spot right there.
[2020.30s -> 2026.30s]  Come on. No!
[2026.30s -> 2028.30s]  Yes.
[2028.30s -> 2030.54s]  Oh, thank God. I'm so relieved. Thank goodness.
[2030.54s -> 2045.00s]  Don't get greedy. Just climb.
[2045.00s -> 2051.21s]  If I just do it normally, I'll be fine.
[2051.21s -> 2073.80s]  Just do it normally. Yes. All right.
[2073.80s -> 2077.37s]  Do I have any food? I do.
[2077.37s -> 2088.60s]  I'm just eating them. Okay. Can I
[2088.60s -> 2091.42s]  clear it with my lightning move?
[2091.42s -> 2107.14s]  I just killed everything else.
[2107.14s -> 2109.14s]  I wasn't even close. I just killed everything else
[2109.14s -> 2111.70s]  in the whole map. What?
[2111.70s -> 2113.94s]  Oh, I can cook here. All right.
[2113.94s -> 2127.05s]  Let me clear this.
[2127.05s -> 2130.38s]  All right. We're good.
[2130.38s -> 2132.38s]  Now I can take a good look and figure this out.
[2132.38s -> 2147.72s]  Arrows. Food.
[2147.72s -> 2162.31s]  Hell yeah. All right. I can cook now.
[2162.31s -> 2164.31s]  Ooh. Somebody said to find one of those. I just found one.
[2164.31s -> 2168.22s]  Happy birthday.
[2168.22s -> 2176.02s]  Happy birthday.
[2176.02s -> 2189.14s]  Take a picture and then kapow.
[2189.14s -> 2202.52s]  I gotta delete some of these pictures. What's this?
[2202.52s -> 2224.33s]  Pretty cool rock. Shit.
[2224.33s -> 2241.54s]  How do I break it? Smash. Kapow.
[2241.54s -> 2244.10s]  Smash. I did not even know
[2244.10s -> 2246.10s]  this was small, like big enough to do this with.
[2246.10s -> 2250.31s]  I thought it was too big.
[2250.31s -> 2257.80s]  All right. Nice. That's two.
[2257.80s -> 2262.09s]  There's only one more. Nice.
[2262.09s -> 2272.84s]  All right. One more. We're good.
[2272.84s -> 2276.81s]  So where's this last one?
[2276.81s -> 2282.44s]  Let me cook some food for us.
[2282.44s -> 2284.44s]  You got ten minutes left. Oh, I got...
[2284.44s -> 2286.44s]  I got ten minutes for each ball.
[2286.44s -> 2290.73s]  I'm gonna be close. All right. I'm gonna pay attention.
[2290.73s -> 2299.75s]  I need fire.
[2299.75s -> 2306.22s]  All right. Where's this last one?
[2306.22s -> 2309.54s]  It's on his neck. All right. Watch this.
[2309.54s -> 2326.57s]  I'm gonna drop this on this fucking guy's head.
[2326.57s -> 2332.71s]  Come on, Link. You can do it.
[2332.71s -> 2334.71s]  Come on. Push it. You can do it. I know you can.
[2334.71s -> 2355.03s]  Perfect.
[2355.03s -> 2392.20s]  Perfect. Crush his head.
[2399.35s -> 2401.35s]  Shit. I just killed a fucking
[2401.35s -> 2403.35s]  goat accidentally. All right.
[2403.35s -> 2421.78s]  I thought it was gonna roll.
[2421.78s -> 2424.54s]  I'm gonna walk this down. Wait, wait, wait.
[2424.54s -> 2427.35s]  I want to bring this too. Where is it?
[2427.35s -> 2430.81s]  I'm gonna be strategic. This is the last one.
[2430.81s -> 2432.81s]  I gotta be strategic. It respawned.
[2432.81s -> 2434.81s]  It wants me to do that, I think. I think it wants me to do that.
[2434.81s -> 2437.05s]  It wants me to crush him. Look.
[2437.05s -> 2440.57s]  It's back. It's back.
[2440.57s -> 2442.74s]  It's right here. It wants me to crush him.
[2442.74s -> 2456.12s]  That's not bad.
[2458.55s -> 2464.50s]  God damn it.
[2464.50s -> 2466.50s]  All right. It hit him.
[2466.50s -> 2492.81s]  At least it hit his ass.
[2492.81s -> 2530.55s]  How do I get him? I get it. Uh-oh.
[2530.55s -> 2541.37s]  It hit him right in the fucking head.
[2541.37s -> 2543.37s]  Why would I have this equipped?
[2543.37s -> 2561.99s]  Why did I have this equipped?
[2561.99s -> 2574.73s]  What the hell?
[2602.94s -> 2609.40s]  I'm alive.
[2609.40s -> 2611.40s]  I'm alive. I'm alive. I'm alive. I'm alive. I'm alive. I'm alive.
[2611.40s -> 2626.82s]  I need more arrows.
[2626.82s -> 2632.07s]  That's the problem.
[2632.07s -> 2646.15s]  There's a lizard here. Don't hit me. Please don't hit me.
[2646.15s -> 2663.37s]  Please get up.
[2663.37s -> 2713.02s]  Climb.
[2713.02s -> 2723.90s]  Holy shit. Look at this. Oh my god.
[2723.90s -> 2727.74s]  This is bad. Oh my god.
[2727.74s -> 2729.74s]  He's coming up. He's coming up. He's coming up. He's coming up.
[2729.74s -> 2731.74s]  He's coming up. He's coming up. He's coming up. He's coming up.
[2731.74s -> 2734.10s]  Hold on. Do not blow those up, please.
[2734.10s -> 2736.10s]  I need those.
[2736.10s -> 2741.67s]  My lightning move isn't cooled down.
[2751.91s -> 2754.41s]  What's wrong with him?
[2754.41s -> 2756.41s]  What's he doing?
[2756.41s -> 2758.41s]  What is he doing?
[2758.41s -> 2761.42s]  Everybody fuck off for a second.
[2761.42s -> 2770.76s]  Just get out of the fucking way.
[2784.20s -> 2788.49s]  Oh.
[2788.49s -> 2800.65s]  That didn't even hurt him.
[2800.65s -> 2802.65s]  What am I doing?
[2802.65s -> 2823.06s]  I'm zooming in on his crotch.
[2823.06s -> 2825.06s]  Fine. I'm fine.
[2825.06s -> 2836.20s]  I am going to be just fine.
[2836.20s -> 2838.20s]  I just have to smear this all over his fucking head a few more times.
[2838.20s -> 2846.07s]  I just have to smear this all over his fucking head a few more times.
[2846.07s -> 2862.65s]  Get out of here.
[2862.65s -> 2881.27s]  You fuck off. Can I punch you?
[2881.27s -> 2883.27s]  Oh, let's go.
[2883.27s -> 2899.58s]  Oh.
[2899.58s -> 2913.51s]  I got him. Stop.
[2913.51s -> 2915.51s]  Stop moving. Stop moving. Stop moving.
[2915.51s -> 2936.55s]  So close.
[2936.55s -> 2938.55s]  Stop. You have what?
[2938.55s -> 2940.55s]  It's not over? What do you mean?
[2940.55s -> 2946.57s]  What time is it?
[2946.57s -> 2954.06s]  What time is it?
[2954.06s -> 2960.65s]  31 minutes.
[2960.65s -> 2963.40s]  I didn't know that lightning instantly killed him.
[2963.40s -> 2969.72s]  I didn't have it charged either.
[2969.72s -> 2973.94s]  It spawns one of these.
[2973.94s -> 2988.26s]  Now there's a shrine up there.
[2988.26s -> 2992.49s]  I'm going to enter the shrine.
[2992.49s -> 2994.49s]  You could have just walked up and taken his necklace while he was sleeping.
[2994.49s -> 3001.06s]  Oh.
[3001.06s -> 3015.96s]  That's good to know.
[3015.96s -> 3017.96s]  What's wrong with my face?
[3017.96s -> 3021.99s]  My face is kind of weird.
[3021.99s -> 3034.15s]  It was really close?
[3034.15s -> 3040.87s]  I should probably cook some food, but I'm not going to.
[3040.87s -> 3043.50s]  That was fun.
[3043.50s -> 3051.24s]  Is there an easy way to get up here?
[3051.24s -> 3066.89s]  It's fine.
[3066.89s -> 3073.21s]  Alright, so what's in here?
[3073.21s -> 3076.54s]  Your eyes are all messed up?
[3076.54s -> 3086.26s]  Something in my teeth?
[3086.26s -> 3100.54s]  Everyone's cyberbullying him.
[3100.54s -> 3105.98s]  Dude, Roblox was so fun.
[3105.98s -> 3122.68s]  We should definitely do it again.
[3122.68s -> 3140.71s]  300 rupees. Okay, I'll take it.
[3140.71s -> 3142.71s]  Oh, also, people started getting the grotto beasts.
[3142.71s -> 3145.27s]  We've seen a lot of people writing
[3145.27s -> 3147.27s]  like, hey, look what I got.
[3147.27s -> 3149.27s]  Look what I got. Look what I got.
[3149.27s -> 3152.86s]  I think a lot of the kits have gone out.
[3152.86s -> 3155.10s]  If you have ordered it, keep an eye out.
[3155.10s -> 3158.23s]  I would anticipate it very soon
[3158.23s -> 3160.23s]  if you ordered it in the first week or so of the presale.
[3160.23s -> 3167.00s]  Got mine yesterday.
[3167.00s -> 3169.30s]  Also, the FAQ
[3169.30s -> 3171.78s]  and the
[3171.78s -> 3173.78s]  quick start rules should be on
[3173.78s -> 3175.78s]  the site now.
[3175.78s -> 3179.37s]  They should be there on the bottom of the page.
[3179.37s -> 3186.02s]  It should be like a PDF or something.
[3186.02s -> 3188.02s]  So, a while back
[3188.02s -> 3191.29s]  I talked about the baby
[3191.29s -> 3194.36s]  being a digital version. So, over the last
[3194.36s -> 3196.60s]  I want to say a couple weeks, two or three weeks
[3196.60s -> 3198.60s]  we've been really trying to figure out what that
[3198.60s -> 3200.60s]  meant and what a digital
[3200.60s -> 3203.78s]  version was going to be. So,
[3203.78s -> 3205.96s]  I will tell you right now what we are
[3205.96s -> 3207.96s]  doing right now, what we're exploring right now, and it's
[3207.96s -> 3210.20s]  currently the thing that we are
[3210.20s -> 3214.23s]  doing. We're going to do a tabletop simulator
[3214.23s -> 3217.03s]  mod, a free mod
[3217.03s -> 3221.30s]  that, there's a person here,
[3221.30s -> 3223.30s]  is going to have all 200 cards available.
[3223.30s -> 3226.25s]  And the idea was to make it so
[3226.25s -> 3229.51s]  so the
[3229.51s -> 3231.51s]  actual experience is not going to be like
[3231.51s -> 3233.51s]  card pack pay openings
[3233.51s -> 3235.51s]  or anything. It's not like, oh yeah, let's
[3235.51s -> 3237.51s]  buy more card packs digitally.
[3237.51s -> 3240.33s]  We understand that there's a lot
[3240.33s -> 3242.33s]  of people that want to play with other people that just
[3242.33s -> 3244.33s]  don't really have any way to do that
[3244.33s -> 3246.33s]  because there is a game, right? There's a game on top
[3246.33s -> 3248.33s]  of it. So,
[3248.33s -> 3250.33s]  the game designer
[3250.33s -> 3252.33s]  and we're going to get some
[3252.33s -> 3254.63s]  other people like
[3254.63s -> 3256.63s]  the core art team and maybe
[3256.63s -> 3258.63s]  a 3D designer is going to come in and
[3258.63s -> 3260.63s]  we're going to make a whole experience in tabletop simulator.
[3260.63s -> 3263.96s]  Just tons of
[3263.96s -> 3265.96s]  little toys and it's going to be a whole
[3265.96s -> 3267.96s]  experience. It's not just going to be, here's a
[3267.96s -> 3269.96s]  wooden desk with all 200 cards. Good
[3269.96s -> 3271.96s]  luck. They're going to dev it out.
[3271.96s -> 3275.03s]  So, if you don't have tabletop
[3275.03s -> 3277.27s]  simulator, that's, I mean
[3277.27s -> 3279.27s]  I think that, it goes on sale
[3279.27s -> 3283.30s]  a lot, doesn't it? I think it's pretty cheap too.
[3283.30s -> 3285.30s]  I think it's only like, what, 10, 15 bucks?
[3285.30s -> 3292.54s]  20 bucks? Yeah, very often.
[3292.54s -> 3298.36s]  But it also gives an opportunity for the, so the
[3298.36s -> 3300.36s]  game designer is going to be
[3300.36s -> 3302.36s]  kind of curating that space
[3302.36s -> 3304.60s]  on top of the art team. So
[3304.60s -> 3306.60s]  it's just going to be free. You can
[3306.60s -> 3308.60s]  have fun, play with it, play with your friends.
[3308.60s -> 3310.60s]  That's kind of the idea.
[3310.60s -> 3315.40s]  I'm seeking adventure.
[3315.40s -> 3318.09s]  You and I have that in common. It is only from here
[3318.09s -> 3320.09s]  that I can probably hear the wind.
[3320.09s -> 3326.87s]  I want to live as the wind does, free and unrestricted
[3326.87s -> 3328.87s]  to bide here and listen to
[3328.87s -> 3330.87s]  its voice offers a taste of that freedom.
[3330.87s -> 3332.87s]  Don't you long to be like the wind
[3332.87s -> 3336.26s]  too? It didn't really occur to me.
[3336.26s -> 3341.77s]  We can read the messages ourselves.
[3341.77s -> 3344.07s]  These?
[3344.07s -> 3346.07s]  You don't want me to read them to you?
[3346.07s -> 3353.61s]  Okay. Is there anything else
[3353.61s -> 3355.91s]  to do with this bird? Have you returned a train
[3355.91s -> 3357.91s]  to become the wind?
[3357.91s -> 3361.50s]  Okay. 20 rupees
[3361.50s -> 3364.95s]  to set it, alright, let's go.
[3364.95s -> 3367.38s]  Wait here while I prepare the course. Obstacle course?
[3367.38s -> 3383.70s]  So I gotta fly through these?
[3383.70s -> 3412.68s]  Gotta go faster than this.
[3412.68s -> 3414.68s]  Daruk's protection is now ready to roll.
[3414.68s -> 3419.99s]  Goku? No.
[3419.99s -> 3425.11s]  All the way up. Oh, over here.
[3425.11s -> 3432.66s]  Whoops. Wait, go down.
[3432.66s -> 3435.93s]  Oh!
[3435.93s -> 3438.42s]  I gotta go.
[3438.42s -> 3440.42s]  Wait, what happened? Why do I have no stamina?
[3440.42s -> 3442.42s]  Am I gonna fall?
[3442.42s -> 3445.11s]  Wait, why did I run out of stamina?
[3445.11s -> 3448.70s]  Do I not have enough stamina to do it?
[3448.70s -> 3460.98s]  I need to eat stamina food.
[3460.98s -> 3467.06s]  23 rings.
[3467.06s -> 3471.91s]  He gave me my money back.
[3471.91s -> 3476.33s]  You know what, here, take it back.
[3476.33s -> 3480.23s]  Let's do it again.
[3480.23s -> 3482.98s]  Release the glider when you're descending.
[3482.98s -> 3484.98s]  Oh, that's true.
[3484.98s -> 3505.08s]  Alright, let's go.
[3505.08s -> 3507.08s]  Do I have an opportunity to release it though?
[3507.08s -> 3532.66s]  How did I not go through it?
[3532.66s -> 3534.66s]  Oh!
[3534.66s -> 3536.66s]  Shit, alright, I gotta...
[3536.66s -> 3552.71s]  That's a tricky one.
[3552.71s -> 3555.53s]  Let go in the middle and then press it again?
[3555.53s -> 3557.53s]  No, I wanna do it again.
[3557.53s -> 3567.18s]  You gonna beat the game tonight?
[3567.18s -> 3569.18s]  No, no, I'm just gonna do some side stuff.
[3569.18s -> 3574.10s]  Eat stamina food. I don't have any.
[3574.10s -> 3577.50s]  I'm gonna have to come back here when I do.
[3577.50s -> 3598.23s]  I went through it.
[3598.23s -> 3600.23s]  You saw me do that. I went right through the middle.
[3600.23s -> 3603.67s]  What the fuck just happened?
[3634.07s -> 3647.70s]  Whatever, I got 25.
[3647.70s -> 3654.09s]  Okay, I made money. I wanna do it again.
[3654.09s -> 3657.22s]  That's the end of the course, right?
[3657.22s -> 3692.98s]  Is that the end? Oh, it's not.
[3722.66s -> 3725.54s]  Did you actually play Roblox?
[3725.54s -> 3729.43s]  Yeah, me, poke, and stir.
[3729.43s -> 3734.30s]  It was a ton of fun. Poke is fucking hilarious too.
[3734.30s -> 3737.75s]  So stir.
[3737.75s -> 3739.75s]  The vibe of that group is really fun.
[3739.75s -> 3754.54s]  Let me go this way.
[3754.54s -> 3764.58s]  I'm gonna go for air this time.
[3764.58s -> 3791.96s]  Much better.
[3791.96s -> 3794.78s]  Where? Over here?
[3794.78s -> 3796.78s]  Get the fuck away from me.
[3796.78s -> 3802.20s]  What's going on?
[3802.20s -> 3804.20s]  Dude, get the lightning out of here.
[3804.20s -> 3806.20s]  The lightning is distracting as fuck.
[3806.20s -> 3809.02s]  Distracting as fuck.
[3809.02s -> 3825.06s]  Relax. That was better than before.
[3825.06s -> 3828.82s]  Nice.
[3828.82s -> 3830.82s]  I'm gonna try one more time. I beat it, but I wanna do one more.
[3830.82s -> 3845.34s]  31 is the biggest one?
[3845.34s -> 3876.49s]  That was risky, but I did it.
[3876.49s -> 3884.49s]  Don't even fucking think about it.
[3884.49s -> 3886.49s]  Don't strike me with lightning, please.
[3886.49s -> 3892.38s]  That was going so well too.
[3892.38s -> 3897.43s]  That was going so well.
[3897.43s -> 3899.43s]  That was like the best...
[3899.43s -> 3913.26s]  I probably wasn't gonna 100% that.
[3913.26s -> 3915.26s]  That was going so good too. Take off the armor?
[3915.26s -> 3941.35s]  Okay, I don't have any gear on anymore.
[3941.35s -> 3943.53s]  I shouldn't get struck by lightning.
[3943.53s -> 3958.55s]  Can I get a bunch of bananas or something?
[3958.55s -> 3985.03s]  Alright, let's go.
[3985.03s -> 3997.43s]  I think I screwed it up. I think I'm alright.
[3997.43s -> 3999.86s]  No. The first one was so much better.
[3999.86s -> 4010.42s]  What is happening with that shit?
[4010.42s -> 4013.43s]  Why do I go through, but it doesn't count?
[4013.43s -> 4015.61s]  Why do I go through, but it doesn't count?
[4015.61s -> 4017.98s]  What's going on?
[4017.98s -> 4025.53s]  I just went through three times.
[4025.53s -> 4045.22s]  I have to do it. Why do I keep doing this with my mouth?
[4045.22s -> 4055.53s]  Like this? I had it that time.
[4055.53s -> 4059.05s]  Did I get struck by lightning?
[4059.05s -> 4089.30s]  Alright, last try and that's it. No matter what.
[4089.30s -> 4091.30s]  Let's try to get too flashy with it.
[4091.30s -> 4093.30s]  No, just try again. I was being flashy.
[4093.30s -> 4096.70s]  I was trying to be so flashy.
[4096.70s -> 4109.62s]  That was stupid.
[4109.62s -> 4150.42s]  Alright, this is actually the last one no matter what.
[4150.42s -> 4152.42s]  Let's go.
[4152.42s -> 4181.74s]  Why are you talking? What happened?
[4181.74s -> 4190.57s]  I just won.
[4190.57s -> 4193.38s]  Just go. I need to get the money back.
[4193.38s -> 4200.10s]  I was going to say, I love how my knees can go through.
[4200.10s -> 4202.10s]  But if my head goes through it doesn't count.
[4202.10s -> 4210.92s]  Why am I losing so much momentum now?
[4210.92s -> 4212.92s]  Why can I not do it anymore?
[4212.92s -> 4217.51s]  I don't get it.
[4217.51s -> 4219.51s]  I've done this like ten times. These last three times I've just fallen on the ground.
[4219.51s -> 4257.83s]  Alright, this is the last one.
[4257.83s -> 4266.46s]  It's alright. I think I'm fine.
[4266.46s -> 4278.94s]  What part of your body has to go through the rings?
[4278.94s -> 4280.94s]  Because sometimes my knees go through and it doesn't work.
[4280.94s -> 4288.04s]  Sometimes my head goes through and it does.
[4288.04s -> 4296.15s]  The middle of my body has to go through.
[4296.15s -> 4298.15s]  Why does this keep screwing up?
[4298.15s -> 4300.65s]  I've done this like fifteen times now.
[4300.65s -> 4330.22s]  I'm doing it the exact way I did it before.
[4330.22s -> 4334.17s]  Oh my god.
[4334.17s -> 4357.08s]  Just go.
[4357.08s -> 4360.09s]  Dude, I can do that. I know I can.
[4360.09s -> 4376.66s]  I know I can do that.
[4376.66s -> 4381.78s]  I made all my money back. We're good. I can do it again.
[4381.78s -> 4387.29s]  I made it all back. We're good. Everything's fine.
[4387.29s -> 4389.29s]  Are you guys betting on these? I think I'm going too quick for you to bet.
[4389.29s -> 4393.83s]  Alright, this is actually going to be the one for real.
[4393.83s -> 4433.38s]  No more messing around.
[4433.38s -> 4435.38s]  What are you talking about?
[4435.38s -> 4438.01s]  Why is this so finicky?
[4438.01s -> 4440.01s]  Why is this so finicky?
[4440.01s -> 4442.01s]  What? Are you crazy?
[4442.01s -> 4444.01s]  What?
[4444.01s -> 4468.26s]  I'm making money but
[4468.26s -> 4474.34s]  What the hell?
[4474.34s -> 4476.34s]  How can I get the first one and not the second one?
[4476.34s -> 4478.34s]  I just got the first one. It's a fucking air vent.
[4478.34s -> 4549.37s]  Yes!
[4549.37s -> 4552.44s]  There it is. I got it.
[4552.44s -> 4576.36s]  What happened? Oh no, people are still betting.
[4576.36s -> 4580.65s]  Oh, I only get a hundred? I thought I was going to get something more.
[4580.65s -> 4586.73s]  Well, I left it with like three hundred extra dollars.
[4586.73s -> 4599.02s]  That's cool.
[4599.02s -> 4601.51s]  I missed one? No, don't tell me that.
[4601.51s -> 4605.42s]  I'm not going to do it anymore. Alright, where should I go from here?
[4605.42s -> 4608.36s]  That was cool. I can remove this.
[4608.36s -> 4617.51s]  It's thirty-five, not thirty-four.
[4617.51s -> 4625.88s]  Eh, it's alright. I want
[4625.88s -> 4629.40s]  Can I upgrade my gear?
[4629.40s -> 4643.85s]  Where was that? It's like over here, isn't it?
[4643.85s -> 4652.55s]  Upgrade the Master Sword. Fifty plus is the top reward.
[4652.55s -> 4662.73s]  How would you even do that?
[4662.73s -> 4665.80s]  Where's the, where's the
[4665.80s -> 4677.51s]  Kakariko? Whatever it is.
[4677.51s -> 4687.48s]  Salmon upgrade? Southeast.
[4687.48s -> 4692.26s]  Where is it? Hyrule Field.
[4692.26s -> 4702.94s]  East. Oh, it's right here. Isn't it?
[4702.94s -> 4706.20s]  Where is it? Right here. Where's the upgrade person?
[4706.20s -> 4720.22s]  I want to upgrade. It's marked with a leaf?
[4720.22s -> 4735.37s]  Isn't this where I have to, the big forest,
[4735.37s -> 4737.37s]  big bunch of trees and shit and I have to go
[4737.37s -> 4756.04s]  this way, right? Yeah. What was that?
[4756.04s -> 4777.14s]  Is that something cool? I don't even know if I have
[4777.14s -> 4779.38s]  any ingredients to do this. I don't.
[4779.38s -> 4787.90s]  I probably do. It's been like
[4787.90s -> 4790.20s]  six to ten in-game hours.
[4790.20s -> 4809.38s]  I can do this. I mean,
[4809.38s -> 4815.66s]  I might as well put your clothes back on.
[4815.66s -> 4819.56s]  Wait, can you not actually do it with my clothes on?
[4819.56s -> 4827.94s]  I don't, I think it just said I couldn't
[4827.94s -> 4833.38s]  really do anything. I don't think it's worth it.
[4833.38s -> 4839.26s]  Yeah, no,
[4839.26s -> 4841.26s]  it didn't have to be on.
[4841.26s -> 4844.01s]  Nah, I'm going to wear it. I want
[4844.01s -> 4849.45s]  this one. I like this stuff. Swim speed
[4849.45s -> 4851.45s]  is cool, but I think I already did that area.
[4851.45s -> 4856.17s]  I feel like I really need it. Although those horns,
[4856.17s -> 4858.17s]  I feel like I have a lot of those.
[4858.17s -> 4860.17s]  I don't know how rare those horns are.
[4860.17s -> 4865.54s]  Go find another fairy.
[4865.54s -> 4867.54s]  Four upgrades per piece.
[4867.54s -> 4877.26s]  Doesn't cost like nothing.
[4877.26s -> 4879.26s]  There's other fairy fountains. Oh, okay.
[4879.26s -> 4885.02s]  I'll just do it. Why not?
[4885.02s -> 4907.14s]  Set bonuses.
[4907.14s -> 4917.24s]  I have.
[4917.24s -> 4919.24s]  So it said follow the path behind
[4919.24s -> 4921.24s]  this area. Follow the
[4921.24s -> 4923.24s]  path and there's something to do.
[4923.24s -> 4946.71s]  I'll check it out. Cool.
[4946.71s -> 4955.16s]  Okay, follow the path.
[4955.16s -> 4957.91s]  Like the actual path path, like
[4957.91s -> 4960.09s]  the road. Or is there some like secret
[4960.09s -> 4967.00s]  over here I haven't seen? What is
[4967.00s -> 4970.52s]  your bedtime?
[4970.52s -> 4972.52s]  Maybe a little bit.
[4972.52s -> 4977.24s]  Northeast. Like over
[4977.24s -> 4990.94s]  here? Do I have to
[4990.94s -> 5002.90s]  climb out of here?
[5002.90s -> 5007.19s]  Am I going the right way? Path
[5007.19s -> 5009.56s]  does not mean climb. I mean, I feel like
[5009.56s -> 5011.80s]  I'm at the end of the
[5011.80s -> 5013.80s]  forest here in the northern section.
[5013.80s -> 5016.81s]  Just kind of stay. I mean,
[5016.81s -> 5032.34s]  you mean like over here? Yeah.
[5032.34s -> 5058.31s]  I think this is it. Birthday
[5058.31s -> 5069.32s]  raid song. I don't have any weapons
[5069.32s -> 5081.91s]  equipped. Not bad. Who's my horse?
[5081.91s -> 5086.44s]  Um, I don't know. I never seem to have
[5086.44s -> 5092.39s]  the horse. About a year ago I was walking along
[5092.39s -> 5094.39s]  the road here at night when I suddenly saw a
[5094.39s -> 5096.39s]  blinding light in the sky. When my eyes finally
[5096.39s -> 5098.39s]  just started looking at a shimmering object floating
[5098.39s -> 5101.21s]  overhead, I couldn't look away. I was bathed in light
[5101.21s -> 5103.21s]  when I came to. I woke up in bed covered in sweat.
[5103.21s -> 5107.29s]  What do you think about
[5107.29s -> 5114.65s]  that? That sounds like a dream.
[5114.65s -> 5116.65s]  Bed full of liquid in an empty room and
[5116.65s -> 5118.65s]  when I looked in the corner there was a weird glowing
[5118.65s -> 5121.08s]  device. When I touched the device
[5121.08s -> 5123.08s]  I was overwhelmed with a feeling of familiarity.
[5123.08s -> 5126.58s]  When I came to I was here.
[5126.58s -> 5129.66s]  What do you think about that? Does that sound familiar?
[5129.66s -> 5131.83s]  Hylian Champion.
[5131.83s -> 5133.83s]  Master Koga.
[5133.83s -> 5166.90s]  I ain't dying here. Got ya!
[5166.90s -> 5172.39s]  Ooh! Demon
[5172.39s -> 5181.42s]  Carver. Alright. What can I drop?
[5181.42s -> 5188.25s]  It's not what I wanted. Okay.
[5188.25s -> 5190.42s]  So left or right here? I'm going to say
[5190.42s -> 5192.42s]  right. Right looks kind of interesting.
[5192.42s -> 5194.66s]  Keep the leaf. Keep the leaf
[5194.66s -> 5207.70s]  please. Keep the leaf.
[5207.70s -> 5213.34s]  That's a lot of damage. In exchange for what?
[5213.34s -> 5215.34s]  I don't know what to drop. You don't need the leaf.
[5215.34s -> 5222.76s]  Oh, people are trolling. Okay.
[5222.76s -> 5224.76s]  Yeah, there's a million trees
[5224.76s -> 5243.58s]  in this world. I'll find another one.
[5243.58s -> 5245.58s]  Interesting. Okay.
[5245.58s -> 5255.88s]  You could beat Ganon
[5255.88s -> 5259.13s]  with a leaf. Um,
[5259.13s -> 5261.37s]  probably not. I highly
[5261.37s -> 5299.00s]  doubt that. How do you break these
[5299.00s -> 5306.10s]  without blowing them up? Do I have to blow these up
[5306.10s -> 5312.10s]  with the magnet? Just by smashing them?
[5312.10s -> 5331.48s]  Oh, okay. Cool. Nice.
[5331.48s -> 5334.02s]  I got a lot of money. I could probably
[5334.02s -> 5358.98s]  buy something nice. You need a big two-hander
[5358.98s -> 5365.32s]  to break them. I mean, this is effective. It doesn't really
[5365.32s -> 5395.18s]  do it a couple times.
[5395.18s -> 5403.80s]  That did not hit me. Master Sword.
[5403.80s -> 5416.86s]  Where's the Master Sword? I mean, it recharges
[5416.86s -> 5418.86s]  in time. Yeah, how come it's not on the menu though?
[5418.86s -> 5436.63s]  That's kind of freaking me out. Yes.
[5436.63s -> 5448.14s]  That's very good. Ooh.
[5448.14s -> 5453.06s]  Down here. Ah,
[5453.06s -> 5457.99s]  that's why everybody wanted me to get a leaf.
[5457.99s -> 5468.36s]  Now I understand. I can
[5468.36s -> 5473.16s]  swim this. That's not a problem. It's not
[5473.16s -> 5478.98s]  even deep. Where's the actual line?
[5478.98s -> 5489.14s]  Is it underwater?
[5489.14s -> 5505.08s]  Underwater. All right. Get up.
[5505.08s -> 5516.90s]  Get on the thing. What are you doing?
[5516.90s -> 5547.69s]  Hey. Nice. As long as I don't
[5547.69s -> 5550.25s]  dash, I think I can. Wait. What on my
[5550.25s -> 5562.02s]  swim? I just upgraded it. How come you're not listening
[5562.02s -> 5566.31s]  to us? Uh, I'm going
[5566.31s -> 5587.24s]  behind the waterfall, right? Swim upwards.
[5587.24s -> 5604.90s]  Swim upwards. Quick. I don't even know what just
[5604.90s -> 5631.70s]  happened. All right. What's wrong?
[5631.70s -> 5639.05s]  That's a very good idea. I think I'll do it.
[5639.05s -> 5641.42s]  How do I get under there though?
[5641.42s -> 5684.26s]  Climb it. Oh, shit. Yep.
[5684.26s -> 5686.44s]  What is in here? This looks pretty expensive.
[5686.44s -> 5693.22s]  Whatever it is. Soldier's
[5693.22s -> 5703.02s]  broadsword. Should I get rid of the
[5703.02s -> 5705.02s]  bat? This thing is 60 damage though.
[5705.02s -> 5711.91s]  That's ridiculous. Not worth it. It's
[5711.91s -> 5714.54s]  terrible. Got extra durability though.
[5714.54s -> 5746.18s]  Not worth it. Okay. So
[5746.18s -> 5748.18s]  now what's the deal here?
[5748.18s -> 5752.92s]  Should I just swim up? How do I
[5752.92s -> 5757.40s]  get down? Swim under?
[5757.40s -> 5762.46s]  I don't think there is like a dive,
[5762.46s -> 5766.30s]  right? Swim through. It's behind it.
[5766.30s -> 5773.91s]  Oh,
[5773.91s -> 5779.16s]  okay. So now what?
[5779.16s -> 5793.10s]  Uh, where am I?
[5793.10s -> 5797.32s]  Look up. I'm gonna fucking die. Hold on.
[5797.32s -> 5800.52s]  What? No. Dude, stop.
[5800.52s -> 5805.13s]  Just let- You killing me here.
[5805.13s -> 5819.53s]  You- I- I can't go down.
[5819.53s -> 5824.20s]  You said- Do you say it was underwater or is it
[5824.20s -> 5833.35s]  up above here? It's not
[5833.35s -> 5835.35s]  down. Oh, I thought people were telling me to dive down.
[5835.35s -> 5845.34s]  Chat- Chat is dumb. It's
[5845.34s -> 5849.24s]  behind the waterfall. What?
[5849.24s -> 5864.22s]  What the hell is up here?
[5864.22s -> 5877.27s]  Am I even moving? Okay.
[5877.27s -> 5885.14s]  I thought it was under- I thought it was down, like in the-
[5885.14s -> 5889.43s]  under the water or something. Okay,
[5889.43s -> 5898.71s]  this makes way more sense. I saw like
[5898.71s -> 5900.71s]  the reflection in the water. I thought it was like
[5900.71s -> 5906.86s]  down in the water. That shit
[5906.86s -> 5909.16s]  wouldn't even reflect that far. Unrealistic.
[5909.16s -> 5928.28s]  Alright, what is this?
[5928.28s -> 5930.28s]  Uh, I don't think we're doing any voting
[5930.28s -> 5942.95s]  or betting. Alright, chest.
[5942.95s -> 5949.67s]  Are you gonna turn any- emote only on though or are you gonna kill me?
[5949.67s -> 5955.94s]  You're gonna get me killed. Cause I can't
[5955.94s -> 5960.04s]  see the chat and they can't help me. Alright.
[5960.04s -> 5969.69s]  Big button. Big button
[5969.69s -> 5976.22s]  can't- ooh, okay, hold on.
[5976.22s -> 5978.22s]  What does this big button need?
[5978.22s -> 5981.93s]  Can I put like a chest on it?
[5981.93s -> 5985.45s]  Okay. I think it's just a weight thing.
[5985.45s -> 6017.69s]  Is it a weight thing? It's gotta be
[6017.69s -> 6034.70s]  it, right? Okay. That's enough
[6034.70s -> 6052.10s]  weight. Okay.
[6052.10s -> 6059.21s]  This goes over here. And then I climb
[6059.21s -> 6064.97s]  that. Wait, let me get the items first.
[6064.97s -> 6066.97s]  This is not gonna mess with the weight, is it?
[6066.97s -> 6075.40s]  Nope, not. Zora sword? If that's any
[6075.40s -> 6084.02s]  better than what I have. Zora sword
[6084.02s -> 6088.68s]  meh. 14 damage.
[6088.68s -> 6104.49s]  That's really not that much. How do I-
[6104.49s -> 6114.39s]  Oh, like this. Is it?
[6114.39s -> 6135.77s]  Well, I hit the wrong button. Do I have four?
[6135.77s -> 6137.77s]  I think like- I feel like I need way
[6137.77s -> 6155.54s]  more stamina. How many do I have? You can't
[6155.54s -> 6163.16s]  see it, but it's two. Very cool.
[6163.16s -> 6165.91s]  What else is down here? Anything else I should do?
[6165.91s -> 6179.27s]  Probably. Can you just do a shrine
[6179.27s -> 6184.78s]  normally? There's a memory
[6184.78s -> 6188.94s]  down here apparently. Okay. Hold on.
[6188.94s -> 6200.90s]  Let me get this. Ooh, wait. What's this?
[6200.90s -> 6210.70s]  Should I climb up here? I'm climbing up here.
[6210.70s -> 6222.86s]  Are you more like Zelda or Link?
[6222.86s -> 6225.93s]  What's that little- what's that little weird guy?
[6225.93s -> 6229.00s]  He like does confetti and like
[6229.00s -> 6235.59s]  flies around. Tingle. Yeah.
[6235.59s -> 6251.26s]  I wonder if I should just keep going that way.
[6251.26s -> 6263.16s]  But, I'm intrigued.
[6263.16s -> 6266.23s]  Vinny also said he's like Tingle.
[6266.23s -> 6269.11s]  Yeah, okay. Vinny's a smart
[6269.11s -> 6288.17s]  fucking guy. Get away from me.
[6288.17s -> 6290.98s]  I'm going across this bridge. I'm not going to fight
[6290.98s -> 6295.98s]  these. Why would I? You can't
[6295.98s -> 6300.90s]  both be Tingle.
[6300.90s -> 6313.69s]  Who can I be? Ganon? No.
[6313.69s -> 6315.69s]  No way. I'm
[6315.69s -> 6324.39s]  way too lazy to be Ganon. The prospect
[6324.39s -> 6327.14s]  of taking over the entire universe.
[6327.14s -> 6329.14s]  Like, oh yeah, alright. The whole fucking
[6329.14s -> 6331.14s]  universe. Let's- I kind of just want to
[6331.14s -> 6333.14s]  watch The Office on Netflix. Never mind.
[6333.14s -> 6335.77s]  That was a- eh. I don't care.
[6335.77s -> 6368.44s]  Check your iPad. Memories.
[6368.44s -> 6384.31s]  Found it. Oh, that's right. Okay.
[6384.31s -> 6418.73s]  Shh. Let's see.
[6442.01s -> 6444.31s]  One second, I felt like I was still
[6444.31s -> 6446.31s]  in Roblox.
[6448.31s -> 6450.31s]  After all, it's not like your last shot
[6450.31s -> 6452.31s]  was up there on Mount Mineru.
[6452.31s -> 6454.31s]  Anything could finally spark the power
[6454.31s -> 6456.31s]  to seal Ganon away. We just
[6456.31s -> 6458.31s]  have to keep looking for that
[6458.31s -> 6463.56s]  thing. That's kind of you.
[6463.56s -> 6465.56s]  Roblox
[6465.56s -> 6467.56s]  brain rot. If I may.
[6467.56s -> 6476.14s]  There is to say it,
[6476.14s -> 6479.21s]  but I was thinking about what I do
[6479.21s -> 6481.96s]  when I'm feeling. You know, what
[6481.96s -> 6483.96s]  usually goes through my mind.
[6483.96s -> 6486.84s]  It helps when I think- when I think
[6486.84s -> 6490.23s]  about it.
[6490.23s -> 6515.58s]  This is it, then.
[6515.58s -> 6517.58s]  Are you sure? Positive.
[6517.58s -> 6519.58s]  It's awake. Ganon.
[6519.58s -> 6527.26s]  Let's stop wasting
[6527.26s -> 6529.26s]  time. We're gonna need everything we got
[6529.26s -> 6531.26s]  to take that thing down.
[6531.26s -> 6533.26s]  Now champions,
[6533.26s -> 6535.26s]  who are your divine beasts?
[6535.26s -> 6537.26s]  Show that swirling swine who's boss.
[6537.26s -> 6539.26s]  Link will need to meet Ganon head-on
[6539.26s -> 6541.26s]  when we attack. This needs to be
[6541.26s -> 6543.26s]  a unified assault.
[6543.26s -> 6545.26s]  Little guy, you get to Hyrule Castle.
[6545.26s -> 6548.26s]  Count on
[6548.26s -> 6550.26s]  us for support. But it's up to you
[6550.26s -> 6552.26s]  to pound Ganon into oblivion.
[6552.26s -> 6555.78s]  Come. We should go.
[6555.78s -> 6557.78s]  We need to get you someplace safe.
[6557.78s -> 6563.10s]  I'm not a child anymore.
[6563.10s -> 6565.10s]  I didn't- I'm sorry. I may not be much use
[6565.10s -> 6569.13s]  on the battlefield. There must
[6569.13s -> 6571.13s]  be something I can do to help.
[6571.13s -> 6591.27s]  I dragged it over. Cause
[6591.27s -> 6593.70s]  I have to be on
[6593.70s -> 6595.70s]  a different input on my monitor.
[6595.70s -> 6598.65s]  And I can't see what's actually
[6598.65s -> 6600.65s]  on my desktop behind the screen.
[6600.65s -> 6605.75s]  That was cool. That was a dramatic
[6605.75s -> 6613.61s]  moment. It was fine.
[6613.61s -> 6615.61s]  There. We'll go facecam off.
[6615.61s -> 6619.83s]  Live tingle reaction.
[6619.83s -> 6635.77s]  Alright, cool. Let's do it.
[6635.77s -> 6641.34s]  Oh, it's one of these
[6641.34s -> 6644.34s]  guys. Alright.
[6644.34s -> 6651.06s]  Okay. Oops.
[6651.06s -> 6683.24s]  Where- Stop!
[6683.24s -> 6685.24s]  For one second! I can't-
[6685.24s -> 6688.06s]  What's going on? What are you doing?
[6688.06s -> 6709.67s]  Shit.
[6732.97s -> 6734.97s]  I don't even know what direction he is swinging at.
[6734.97s -> 6736.97s]  Is it vertical or
[6736.97s -> 6749.90s]  horizontal? I need a shield.
[6749.90s -> 6753.35s]  Oh, right. I unequipped my shield.
[6753.35s -> 6755.35s]  There's a stupid lightning
[6755.35s -> 6757.35s]  dogshit. And now I can't
[6757.35s -> 6759.35s]  parry this dogshit.
[6759.35s -> 6761.35s]  Okay.
[6761.35s -> 6792.25s]  Oh my god. You have a lot of health.
[6792.25s -> 6800.82s]  Don't!
[6800.82s -> 6807.35s]  I need a- Where-
[6807.35s -> 6809.35s]  Put a weapon on! What's going on?
[6809.35s -> 6814.22s]  Oh my goodness gracious.
[6814.22s -> 6823.88s]  What can I even eat?
[6823.88s -> 6830.66s]  I have to eat all this stuff. I have to.
[6830.66s -> 6833.16s]  Eat it all. Just eat everything. I don't-
[6833.16s -> 6849.54s]  Doesn't matter. Oh, you do that more than
[6849.54s -> 6857.93s]  a few times.
[6857.93s -> 6860.74s]  Oh, that wasn't a swing.
[6860.74s -> 6863.43s]  I think I'm dead here.
[6863.43s -> 6884.74s]  Oh, I'm in so much trouble.
[6884.74s -> 6894.66s]  Oh, missed it.
[6894.66s -> 6910.71s]  One more hit. Yeah!
[6910.71s -> 6917.54s]  Very nice. What do I get?
[6917.54s -> 6925.08s]  Sword.
[6925.08s -> 6927.08s]  Mighty. Lionel. Bow.
[6927.08s -> 6931.75s]  Well, I absolutely am getting rid of something.
[6931.75s -> 6934.89s]  Holy shit. Alright, awesome.
[6934.89s -> 6937.64s]  What should I get rid of? Golden bow?
[6937.64s -> 6946.92s]  I feel like this is the worst of all of them.
[6946.92s -> 6952.17s]  Golden bow. Another lionel shield.
[6952.17s -> 6958.23s]  I think.
[6958.23s -> 6961.18s]  What is better? A knight shield or a lionel shield?
[6961.18s -> 6975.11s]  Probably the knight shield, yeah.
[6975.11s -> 6977.11s]  The lionel shield does damage when you parry.
[6977.11s -> 6986.78s]  That one's about to break.
[6986.78s -> 6988.78s]  This one's new though, isn't it?
[6988.78s -> 6992.30s]  Drop the old lionel shield.
[6992.30s -> 6995.86s]  Actually good idea.
[6995.86s -> 6997.86s]  But how much have I used it?
[6997.86s -> 7018.52s]  I have used that a lot.
[7018.52s -> 7020.52s]  Sparkle means new.
[7020.52s -> 7033.69s]  Go back to Impa.
[7033.69s -> 7038.55s]  Is that all I can do here?
[7038.55s -> 7047.13s]  Copy. That was part of it, right?
[7047.13s -> 7050.71s]  Keep going up the mountain.
[7050.71s -> 7052.95s]  It's kind of chilly here.
[7054.95s -> 7060.12s]  Wait, even with the occurence?
[7060.12s -> 7076.38s]  I don't think I have anything, do I?
[7076.38s -> 7078.81s]  Flame sword? Is that enough?
[7078.81s -> 7085.90s]  No. I don't think I can do this.
[7085.90s -> 7098.63s]  I need special armor.
[7098.63s -> 7102.73s]  That's what I figured. Alright.
[7102.73s -> 7107.08s]  Sweet. Imagine there's something up here.
[7107.08s -> 7116.02s]  There is. Eventually.
[7116.02s -> 7119.86s]  Where's Impa?
[7119.86s -> 7129.46s]  Somebody said go talk to Impa now. Mark it.
[7129.46s -> 7135.22s]  I don't want to mark this spot right here
[7135.22s -> 7137.22s]  because I'll be confused how to get there.
[7137.22s -> 7139.22s]  How did I get up here?
[7139.22s -> 7143.24s]  It was through the waterfall.
[7143.24s -> 7147.78s]  I'll mark it just to...
[7147.78s -> 7168.25s]  Leap. Oh shit.
[7168.25s -> 7203.62s]  I don't know if that was a quest or not.
[7203.62s -> 7209.70s]  Let's turn it in. What do you got for me?
[7209.70s -> 7212.90s]  Impa uses a neti pot, do you?
[7212.90s -> 7216.66s]  I've used it before, but not in a while.
[7216.66s -> 7241.42s]  It kind of feels weird.
[7241.42s -> 7244.17s]  I'll hand this over to you now before I forget.
[7244.17s -> 7248.25s]  Champions tunic.
[7248.25s -> 7250.25s]  In ancient Hyrule, this garment could only be worn by one
[7250.25s -> 7252.25s]  and earn the respect of the royal family.
[7252.25s -> 7254.25s]  Equipment will reveal an enemy's life gauge.
[7254.25s -> 7256.25s]  Wait, don't I already have that?
[7256.25s -> 7260.79s]  Doesn't it already show people's health bars?
[7260.79s -> 7274.68s]  Exact values.
[7274.68s -> 7287.80s]  Wait, is it telling me to go kill the divine beasts?
[7287.80s -> 7293.80s]  I already got three down.
[7293.80s -> 7311.19s]  Let me see that thing. Five.
[7311.19s -> 7313.19s]  If I upgrade this, it's already going to be...
[7313.19s -> 7316.01s]  Alright, that's cool. Do I have enough materials to upgrade it?
[7316.01s -> 7334.42s]  I don't think I do.
[7334.42s -> 7337.50s]  Be careful.
[7337.50s -> 7339.50s]  You're dressed like a dork right now. I think I look pretty cool.
[7339.50s -> 7348.58s]  When it's fully upgraded, it's one of the strongest in the game.
[7348.58s -> 7350.58s]  Well, alright, I'll keep it for sure.
[7350.58s -> 7355.64s]  Alright, I think that's probably a good place to call it.
[7355.64s -> 7359.93s]  I think this is a good time.
[7359.93s -> 7362.42s]  11.15. Five hours and some change.
[7362.42s -> 7367.48s]  I gotta get some food too.
[7367.48s -> 7372.09s]  It was a really fun night though.
[7372.09s -> 7375.10s]  I had a great time.
[7375.10s -> 7377.10s]  I feel like the vibes were on tonight.
[7377.10s -> 7381.78s]  So, it was a good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good night.
[7381.78s -> 7389.72s]  Do the DLC?
[7389.72s -> 7400.65s]  Uh, yeah, I mean...
[7400.65s -> 7402.65s]  We're just gonna play it. I'll play it just to turn it on.
[7402.65s -> 7406.22s]  Then I got really nothing else going on.
[7406.22s -> 7411.59s]  I think the next thing I really want to do...
[7411.59s -> 7415.50s]  I did that.
[7415.50s -> 7421.66s]  I want to at least get this area uncovered.
[7421.66s -> 7428.76s]  Because I want the whole map sort of revealed at this point.
[7428.76s -> 7432.86s]  At least from here.
[7432.86s -> 7443.10s]  Baron is really cool.
[7443.10s -> 7448.02s]  When are you gonna do no-cam chill streams?
[7448.02s -> 7450.26s]  Yeah, I feel like they've been a little crazy recently, but...
[7450.26s -> 7457.37s]  There's been a lot going on.
[7457.37s -> 7459.37s]  We'll slow it down a little bit.
[7459.37s -> 7462.25s]  I said that last week, but I mean it this time.
[7462.25s -> 7466.39s]  We're gonna hold the, uh...
[7466.39s -> 7475.85s]  We're gonna put the brakes on.
[7475.85s -> 7477.85s]  Yeah, I mean, next stream, I don't know if I'm gonna play Breath of the Wild next.
[7477.85s -> 7480.98s]  Maybe I will.
[7480.98s -> 7483.61s]  Let's say, um... Friday?
[7483.61s -> 7486.30s]  Oh, also, uh...
[7486.30s -> 7488.92s]  Something else I really want to do.
[7488.92s -> 7490.92s]  I want to do another, like, 80s and 90s commercial watch stream.
[7490.92s -> 7492.92s]  I feel like people really enjoyed that.
[7492.92s -> 7497.66s]  I thought that was really fun.
[7497.66s -> 7499.66s]  I think we'll probably do that at some point, too.
[7499.66s -> 7502.98s]  People have been asking for that again.
[7502.98s -> 7504.98s]  And I've just kind of been like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[7504.98s -> 7508.36s]  Maybe we'll do that, I don't know, at some point this weekend.
[7508.36s -> 7511.05s]  Maybe a little bit after this weekend.
[7511.05s -> 7518.22s]  I'll get it set up.
[7518.22s -> 7520.22s]  Maybe it launches tomorrow.
[7520.22s -> 7529.24s]  Ooh, maybe we'll do that on Friday.
[7529.24s -> 7534.23s]  Yeah, I still have to watch Ster play Five Nights at Freddy's.
[7534.23s -> 7536.23s]  But I think we played Roblox for, like, three hours.
[7536.23s -> 7538.23s]  And I think, uh...
[7538.23s -> 7547.26s]  I don't know if we anticipated we were gonna do that.
[7547.26s -> 7549.26s]  But yeah, there's a couple games that me and Ster are gonna play at some point, too.
[7549.26s -> 7561.21s]  Next week, probably.
[7561.21s -> 7567.10s]  More of Roblox.
[7567.10s -> 7569.10s]  Roblox is, like, the kind of game that I kinda like.
[7569.10s -> 7573.77s]  It's just, you can just jump in a game and who cares?
[7573.77s -> 7576.07s]  It doesn't even matter.
[7576.07s -> 7578.50s]  Thirty minutes can go by and you can just leave.
[7578.50s -> 7585.08s]  Or you can play for, like, two hours.
[7585.08s -> 7594.68s]  There's no shame.
[7594.68s -> 7596.68s]  No, that was great. Thanks again.
[7596.68s -> 7599.75s]  Big thanks to Poke and obviously Ster.
[7599.75s -> 7601.75s]  Vibes were immaculate tonight.
[7601.75s -> 7607.58s]  It was really fun, really funny.
[7607.58s -> 7621.72s]  And I'll see you guys on Friday.
[7621.72s -> 7624.28s]  I don't know exactly what we'll do on Friday.
[7624.28s -> 7626.28s]  Anticipate either Resident Evil 4 Mercenaries, maybe Breath of the Wild,
[7626.28s -> 7628.28s]  maybe, you know, maybe I might just turn on something random.
[7628.28s -> 7632.41s]  Just play it. We'll see.
[7632.41s -> 7634.41s]  Friday's stream is gonna be slowed down.
[7634.41s -> 7637.22s]  We're gonna chill out.
[7637.22s -> 7639.22s]  And then at some point, maybe this weekend, we'll do the 80s and 90s ads.
[7639.22s -> 7646.70s]  See if I can get it set up.
[7646.70s -> 7663.26s]  I'll let you know.
[7663.26s -> 7684.23s]  Yeah, Hilux 2.
[7684.23s -> 7686.23s]  Can we submit videos?
[7686.23s -> 7689.62s]  Um, no, I have a lot of compilations that we didn't even see.
[7689.62s -> 7693.27s]  So if I ever get to a point where
[7693.27s -> 7697.37s]  I need more,
[7697.37s -> 7699.61s]  which, I don't know how often I do this kind of stuff,
[7699.61s -> 7703.00s]  so I don't know if I do it at the frequency to need to have
[7703.00s -> 7705.00s]  a bunch of submissions or something.
[7705.00s -> 7707.00s]  Because it's still a lot that we have not even looked at.
[7707.00s -> 7718.14s]  There's the music?
[7718.14s -> 7723.06s]  Oh shit, sorry.
[7723.06s -> 7728.81s]  Oh well, we're at the end anyways.
[7728.81s -> 7730.81s]  Vinnie might have some good playlists, especially for terrible video game ads.
[7730.81s -> 7736.31s]  Yeah, I'll be talking to him soon anyways.
[7736.31s -> 7738.31s]  Maybe I'll see if he's got any good ones.
[7738.31s -> 7746.76s]  But yeah, thanks for watching.
[7746.76s -> 7754.70s]  Good night, good stream.
