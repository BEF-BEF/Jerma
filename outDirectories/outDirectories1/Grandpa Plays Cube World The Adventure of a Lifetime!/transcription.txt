[0.31s -> 11.18s]  Well, you have to put it in the pot for two hours.
[11.18s -> 13.18s]  Yeah, but what's the temperature in it?
[13.18s -> 16.18s]  It sits in the pot for two hours. You have to cook it for two hours, otherwise it's not gonna work.
[16.18s -> 18.18s]  I get it. What temperature does it have to be set at?
[18.18s -> 22.18s]  It's a fucking pot roast. You can't screw it up. Get out. I'm doing a video.
[22.18s -> 23.18s]  What's the... I need to tell you...
[23.18s -> 24.18s]  Get out!
[24.18s -> 25.18s]  Oh, Jesus.
[25.18s -> 29.18s]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen. It's Grandpa here.
[29.18s -> 33.18s]  And today, I've got a special fucking video for you.
[33.18s -> 36.18s]  Because I got access to Cube World.
[36.18s -> 41.06s]  Okay, so this is Jerma's file. We can go ahead and fucking delete that.
[41.06s -> 47.06s]  Start a new file for Grandpa's character. Let's get going there. Create. Click it, baby.
[47.06s -> 48.37s]  Was that a guitar?
[48.37s -> 50.61s]  I don't want to play the musician.
[50.61s -> 56.61s]  There's a musician, we got ear musician, we got drunk guy, we got Gremlin from Gremlins 2.
[56.61s -> 60.61s]  It was a pretty good movie, but I don't really want to play as a Gremlin.
[60.61s -> 65.61s]  We got the drunk goblin. I don't like the drunk goblin. The lizard, I like lizard people.
[65.61s -> 68.61s]  Undead, I don't think I want to play. Fucking frog people.
[68.61s -> 74.49s]  I'm playing as a fucking frog man. I'm not even going to go any further on the characters.
[74.49s -> 81.49s]  So what you do in Minecraft is pretty simple. You go around and you collect resources and you fight monsters.
[81.49s -> 84.49s]  What the hell is that? What the fuck is this? What is going on here?
[84.49s -> 88.49s]  What is this, a Ninja Turtles? What the fuck are the Ninja Turtles doing in this game?
[88.49s -> 91.49s]  Look, it's Leonardo that's trying to tell him behind him.
[93.49s -> 100.06s]  What are you doing in this game? I don't, I have no, what am I supposed to even be doing?
[100.06s -> 103.81s]  Does anybody know what you're doing in this game?
[103.81s -> 108.50s]  I have not figured out, all I've done is, was that a bee? It's a fucking bee.
[108.50s -> 110.50s]  Come on, you bee bitch.
[110.50s -> 115.80s]  You see, the real awesome part about this game is the fact that I'm battling right now as a frog.
[115.80s -> 119.80s]  There's never been a game in existence where you could fight people as frogs.
[119.80s -> 122.80s]  It just never existed and that's why I like it.
[122.80s -> 126.49s]  And that's the five experience points right there, ladies and gentlemen.
[126.49s -> 128.49s]  I just figured out how to play Cube World.
[128.49s -> 134.33s]  I'm concerned about the people who made this game because they're going to get fucking sued.
[134.33s -> 137.33s]  First, this is Ninja Turtles and then look, it's the Seven Dwarfs.
[137.33s -> 140.33s]  Disney is going to have a field day with these guys.
[140.33s -> 145.33s]  I can look at the Snuffy, that's Gruffy, that's Poopy and Snoopy. See, that's the Seven Dwarfs.
[146.63s -> 148.63s]  How are they not going to get sued by this?
[148.63s -> 152.00s]  I really am concerned. Let me go get a closer look here.
[152.00s -> 158.24s]  All right, Fluffy, you need to go back to Disney World because I said so.
[158.24s -> 164.07s]  What? They just melted me.
[164.07s -> 167.57s]  The Seven Dwarfs didn't have those fucking powers.
[167.57s -> 172.22s]  Would you look who it is, everybody?
[172.22s -> 176.22s]  It's Donatello by himself without his boys.
[176.22s -> 179.22s]  Hey, Donnie, how are you? How are the rest of the Ninja Turtles?
[179.22s -> 182.22s]  Yeah, without them you aren't so fucking tough now, are you?
[182.22s -> 184.97s]  Got something to say?
[184.97s -> 188.10s]  I have my own house.
[188.10s -> 191.79s]  Donatello, I think you might have a brain injury.
[191.79s -> 195.25s]  Somebody help me, somebody please help me.
[195.25s -> 197.25s]  I got a bunch of animals following me.
[197.25s -> 199.25s]  I got like two animal bug birds.
[199.25s -> 201.25s]  What are you doing?
[201.25s -> 203.25s]  What are you doing? Leave him alone.
[203.25s -> 204.25s]  What did he do?
[204.25s -> 210.25s]  Why did they do that to him, you bullies, you savages, you beasts?
[210.25s -> 211.25s]  No, leave him alone.
[211.25s -> 214.25s]  All he wanted was some bird seed. I have it in my pocket.
[214.25s -> 216.25s]  What about this bird? This bird's like, fuck that.
[216.25s -> 218.25s]  I want nothing to do with this.
[218.25s -> 220.25s]  He has absolutely nothing to do with this.
[220.25s -> 222.25s]  Well, it looks like all your friends are dead.
[222.25s -> 223.25s]  He's like, fuck that, dude.
[223.25s -> 225.25s]  All right, I guess I'll help you, you know, whatever.
[225.25s -> 227.25s]  I can't believe I'm still dead.
[227.25s -> 228.55s]  I'm dead.
[228.55s -> 230.79s]  Oh, Jesus.
[230.79s -> 237.36s]  Okay, I kind of feel bad about what just happened.
[237.36s -> 240.94s]  How did I end up in a tree?
[240.94s -> 242.31s]  What?
[242.31s -> 245.19s]  Hello, Mr. Peacock, how are you?
[245.19s -> 246.19s]  How are you today?
[246.19s -> 248.19s]  Yes, I smell good, thank you.
[248.19s -> 250.19s]  I've got some trouble here.
[250.19s -> 251.19s]  Oh, my God.
[251.19s -> 252.19s]  Kick his ass.
[252.19s -> 253.19s]  Kick his fucking ass.
[253.19s -> 254.19s]  Look at this animation.
[254.19s -> 256.19s]  Look at this awesome animation.
[256.19s -> 257.19s]  He's skiing at him.
[257.19s -> 258.19s]  Look at this.
[258.19s -> 260.19s]  Oh, my goodness gracious, you are...
[260.19s -> 262.56s]  Oh, he died.
[262.56s -> 263.56s]  Now I'm sad.
[263.56s -> 266.31s]  I keep killing birds in this game.
[266.31s -> 268.31s]  I feel terrible.
[268.31s -> 269.31s]  I'm a bird killer.
[269.31s -> 273.31s]  But to be fair here, guys, he did do that on his own.
[273.31s -> 275.31s]  I didn't ask him to.
[275.31s -> 278.31s]  He just flipped the fuck out and started skiing at the guy.
[278.31s -> 279.31s]  And you know what?
[279.31s -> 282.00s]  That's what we shoot in the clouds.
[282.00s -> 283.00s]  I like this game.
[283.00s -> 286.31s]  Some kind of encampment over here.
[286.31s -> 288.31s]  Looks like there could be some food and some supplies.
[288.31s -> 290.31s]  There is nothing special.
[290.31s -> 292.55s]  Well, there is some stuff here.
[292.55s -> 293.55s]  Is this yours?
[293.55s -> 296.55s]  Hey, Mr. Swimman, hey, come on up here.
[296.55s -> 297.55s]  I want to talk to you.
[297.55s -> 298.92s]  Do you own this camp?
[298.92s -> 299.92s]  How did you build this?
[299.92s -> 301.61s]  Come on up here.
[301.61s -> 303.78s]  You want to make some food and stuff?
[303.78s -> 304.78s]  We could be friends.
[304.78s -> 307.22s]  No, okay, don't want to be friends.
[307.22s -> 309.22s]  You just dug your own grave.
[309.22s -> 310.46s]  See you later.
[310.46s -> 312.46s]  Get fucking rapid fired.
[312.46s -> 315.14s]  That's how you do it, ladies and gentlemen.
[315.14s -> 316.14s]  You take his money.
[316.14s -> 318.38s]  And then you go back and you take his food, too.
[318.38s -> 321.69s]  That pineapple is mine.
[321.69s -> 323.69s]  You had your chance to be friendly.
[323.69s -> 325.93s]  Just wanted to share.
[325.93s -> 329.62s]  Mmm, this is going to taste real good, baby.
[329.62s -> 331.62s]  Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.
