[2.62s -> 12.49s]  No, I'm not back yet. I'm not back yet. I want to I want to refill my drink. I'm not quite back yet.
[12.49s -> 48.13s]  Not quite. Give me a sec. Hold on. I'm not quite back yet. I need to refill my drink.
[48.13s -> 56.49s]  I do have something really cool though. I think I've showed this already, didn't I? I probably did. It's cool though.
[56.49s -> 69.65s]  All right, actually, you know, I'll be all right. I'll be I'll take a break in a little bit. Let's just get to it.
[69.69s -> 84.65s]  Okay. Hello. How are you? There's that. There's that. And of course here am I.
[85.01s -> 96.78s]  I'm back. Welcome everybody to season two of multiverses. It's been a while since we played this.
[96.90s -> 99.36s]  Thank you Warner Brothers for sponsoring the stream.
[99.36s -> 107.98s]  This is gonna be a couple of hours of sponsored content. By the way, just in case you didn't know. What's it available on?
[107.98s -> 115.87s]  Do we know? PlayStation, Xbox, PC, cross-platform. They just did a huge, huge
[116.63s -> 121.20s]  internet change and it's apparently really cool and it's apparently good.
[125.01s -> 127.53s]  There's some new characters we haven't played with which I need to do that first.
[127.61s -> 138.84s]  But yeah, season two, I believe just started right now. You'll see Marvin Martian at some point soon here. Show us your legs.
[139.00s -> 147.12s]  They exist. Here, you wanna, you wanna see what, okay, fine.
[147.24s -> 158.23s]  You wanna see what kind of, you wanna see what kind of pants I'm wearing? Here, you wanna see? Yeah, there it is.
[158.23s -> 170.57s]  There's, there are my pants. There, I ripped the leg. It's fine. These things were already ripped.
[170.57s -> 181.66s]  Did you, could you hear the tearing? Could you, did it come through?
[183.95s -> 190.51s]  Let's get to it everybody. Okay, I actually need to practice first.
[190.51s -> 197.76s]  But yeah, thanks again to Warner Brothers. Warner Brothers has been incredibly awesome to this channel. Let's see who's here.
[197.76s -> 207.78s]  I know there's another Gremlins character, which is pretty sick. So let's see who we got. They've added, of course,
[207.78s -> 212.94s]  there's Rick from Rick and Morty. There's Black Adam. There's
[214.24s -> 231.18s]  Stripe. Let me see Black Adam. Let's see what you do. Okay, that's cool. Looks, looks pretty good.
[231.66s -> 242.99s]  All right, so what about the specials? Let me read about this because that's pretty cool. Whoa, a lot of Bugs Bunny stuff.
[243.23s -> 255.37s]  Yeah, I'm a little rusty, but let me go to the move list. Okay, so let's see. That's a, okay.
[255.37s -> 259.01s]  Black Adam releases a beam of lightning to, this is just neutral, why?
[259.83s -> 262.95s]  Damaging them repeatedly and applying shock before tossing them either up or down.
[263.23s -> 269.63s]  Can I choose which way they go? When the lightning hits a target it searches for nearby
[269.99s -> 275.34s]  targets, jumping to them to repeat the move in a chain of electric attacks. You can charge it.
[275.38s -> 282.35s]  All right. Dash forward and is chased moments later by a bolt projectile.
[282.35s -> 290.42s]  This bolt will reflect off the force field generated by Black Adam's grounded down special. Okay, let's see.
[290.42s -> 296.23s]  Let's see what that looks like. So what's the down special? That stays there.
[296.79s -> 310.76s]  It bounces off that. So what does that do? Black Adam briefly gains the ability to fly in any direction. That's awesome.
[311.10s -> 319.69s]  Generates an electromagnetic force that it blocks enemy. That's actually insane. It blocks all projectiles.
[319.77s -> 324.48s]  My voice did that. It was a weird thing that just happened, but trust me, I actually think it's interesting.
[324.48s -> 339.70s]  All right. So what about this stuff? Holy shit. Seems actually pretty good. Lot of cooldowns though, it seems.
[340.06s -> 357.51s]  How long can you fly for? A pretty long time. I'll give it a try. Okay, so what about who's next?
[358.63s -> 362.07s]  There's also Stripe, which is, that's definitely, I'm gonna play Stripe for sure.
[365.78s -> 366.90s]  Gremlins.
[366.90s -> 372.72s]  Already like it. Already like the moves.
[372.72s -> 375.06s]  It's, you know, it's kind of funny.
[375.22s -> 383.78s]  I never thought in my entire life that they would bring gremlins back, but they did. All right, that's a pretty good combo. What about down?
[385.77s -> 388.94s]  Sawz?
[388.94s -> 399.15s]  All right, let's take a look at the moves. Stripe fires his gun at close range. All right, there's a gun.
[399.15s -> 408.74s]  I believe that means that they're targeted. Okay. He will shoot at them. Okay, if Stripe has targeted an enemy,
[408.74s -> 414.42s]  he will shoot at them instead, regardless of distance. That just seems like a better version of
[415.10s -> 418.49s]  Velma. Doesn't Velma put a target?
[418.53s -> 424.90s]  All right, Stripe charges a push with his skateboard and shoots across the area. He also can combo into a backflip.
[424.90s -> 429.32s]  Oh my god, that's fast. Okay.
[429.88s -> 444.71s]  That's terrifying. I like this character. Oh, I like this character a lot.
[445.43s -> 447.88s]  Okay, cool. What else we got?
[447.88s -> 455.06s]  I could just kind of learn as I go. Stripe dashes upward at his target.
[455.06s -> 463.38s]  If he hits any projectile while leaping, he will destroy it. Stripe pulls out a bundle of dynamite that detonates after a duration. Press input
[463.38s -> 465.38s]  again to detonate it immediately.
[466.34s -> 477.74s]  Detonating ignites and hits enemies outward. Stripe also receives damage. What? So I get her too? Oh, okay.
[479.82s -> 485.46s]  All right, I'm taking Stripe into ranked. Show Marvin? I don't know if Marvin's available. I don't think he's out yet.
[488.18s -> 507.70s]  There's no- I have to- we have to look at Rick for a second at least. Just for a second. Actually kind of cracked.
[517.26s -> 523.80s]  Actually kind of cracked. I think I might be playing Rick Sanchez.
[527.66s -> 533.53s]  That was funny. I'm sorry it was. That was actually pretty funny. That was funny. Yeah, it was.
[533.85s -> 543.13s]  All right, let's give it a try. I'm in- I'm in fucking wood league, so it really doesn't matter. Let's look at the battle pass.
[544.66s -> 552.01s]  Astronaut velvet. Pretty cool. Utility belt Batman. What else is here? What's the very last thing?
[552.57s -> 556.49s]  Shield and bubbles.
[556.49s -> 571.22s]  I love the ring out effect stuff. What is this? What's this? Taz taunt. Taz hungry. What's this?
[571.70s -> 575.93s]  Bug's bunny taunt. All right, I'm ready. I think I'm- I think I'm warmed up.
[576.65s -> 578.65s]  Gotta take a real series, huh?
[580.34s -> 587.10s]  I think I'm ready. Let's go- let's go play wood league. I'm ready. All right, let's get out of here.
[587.18s -> 593.27s]  How do I get out of here? Oh, there we go. All right, you guys pumped up for season two of multiverses. Let's go!
[596.49s -> 598.49s]  Top 10 most pumped up moments.
[602.12s -> 604.52s]  There's- they added a bunch of weird shit too. This is cool.
[605.28s -> 611.67s]  Arcade classic? Yeah, like look, there's like weird like silly mode. We definitely have to play silly mode.
[614.47s -> 617.51s]  Let me get back into- should I do ranked? This is gonna be so embarrassing.
[618.52s -> 621.88s]  All right, I'm gonna do ranked one-on-one and it's gonna be a desa-
[623.48s -> 631.64s]  Should I warm up first? No, we're going right in with stripe. Let's go. I'm ready.
[637.69s -> 652.76s]  I think I got- I- it's like riding a bike. Yeah, silly mode activated. I wonder what it is. Where's the level-
[657.14s -> 659.88s]  Any perks?
[659.88s -> 666.57s]  Oh, this is gonna be a disaster. Um, all right. Well, let's see what happens. Uh, my rank- rank-
[670.07s -> 674.63s]  Excuse me, didn't even show this bad boy off. That's a multiverses controller.
[676.17s -> 681.66s]  I didn't think I was gonna get a multiverses control. All right, let me actually be real here. Let me try.
[681.98s -> 686.52s]  It's all about the gun. It's all about the dynamite.
[687.67s -> 700.38s]  Here we go.
[700.38s -> 705.08s]  Ooh!
[705.08s -> 708.92s]  My audio is all messed up.
[708.92s -> 725.03s]  Ah!
[725.03s -> 744.66s]  Oh, that move is gonna be so cool if you can hit it. Ooh, I can throw blades too. That's cool.
[745.22s -> 757.24s]  I just hurt myself.
[757.24s -> 764.44s]  Oh!
[764.44s -> 766.44s]  How am I still on the stage? That's crazy.
[783.22s -> 815.46s]  Oh, not good. It's all right. I love the screams. Come on.
[825.62s -> 827.62s]  All right. Come on. Come on. I got four minutes. I got four minutes.
[848.14s -> 860.55s]  Don't do it. No!
[861.91s -> 865.96s]  It's all right. It's a warm-up. It's a warm-up. It's the first match I played in like three weeks.
[866.44s -> 873.19s]  That was- I did pretty good. That wasn't bad. That's the first match I've had in like three weeks.
[873.83s -> 880.44s]  Let's go again.
[880.44s -> 886.78s]  You don't have any perks. You lost to an Xbox player? So what?
[887.90s -> 891.90s]  What do you- should I- who should I play with? I'm gonna stick with Stripe.
[893.37s -> 897.42s]  No, no. We change it up.
[897.42s -> 897.92s]  Bugs.
[901.85s -> 915.80s]  I got perks on Bugs. Level 11. I was pretty good with uh- what's the name there? Um,
[916.36s -> 917.40s]  Gizmo.
[917.40s -> 925.11s]  Yeah, go ahead. Bet. Hey, the rust is gonna shake off here and I'm gonna do just fine.
[931.85s -> 933.85s]  Uh-oh, he's bringing out the main.
[934.33s -> 945.48s]  I got one minute. I don't want to- this is a nice controller. I don't want to mess it up.
[946.04s -> 948.04s]  All right, let's go. Don't be messing around.
[949.08s -> 969.85s]  Check this out. What the hell is going on?
[974.81s -> 989.43s]  Shit. All right, bring it back. Let's go.
[1018.86s -> 1038.36s]  Oh shit.
[1038.36s -> 1050.23s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Sorry. Sorry. I got plenty of time.
[1066.70s -> 1081.96s]  Don't do anything stupid. I got the advantage here. There it is. All right. We're good. We're good. We're getting it back.
[1086.49s -> 1101.19s]  This is ranked, man. I gotta get out of Wood League. I mean, we gotta go for the whole thing, right? This is it.
[1108.38s -> 1111.10s]  Do I stick with Bugs or should I go- no, I gotta stick with what I know, right?
[1115.53s -> 1128.81s]  Hmm, land the first knock-up, knockback. All right, cool. I'm gonna stick with Bugs. It's like riding a bike. I remember all the moves.
[1129.29s -> 1139.48s]  Go with Rick? I don't know anything about Rick. I would have to go with not in ranked. I'm just gonna joke around with it.
[1139.72s -> 1146.31s]  That's why you have to practice.
[1146.31s -> 1149.45s]  Yeah, I'm doing it right now.
[1151.66s -> 1157.10s]  All right, let's see if I can pull this out. Let me get into my zone here. All right, let's go.
[1157.50s -> 1162.84s]  I feel like my eyes are bugging out of my head. All right, just let's do it.
[1163.08s -> 1224.04s]  It's my odd one. All right, this is the Rick Sanchez level. Gotta keep the pressure up. Shit. Oh,
[1244.74s -> 1261.64s]  Ooh, oh, it's gonna come. Bad. Come on. Come on. Sweaty hands.
[1298.92s -> 1305.93s]  What was that? That was a dog toy. You have to go off the line.
[1317.61s -> 1320.97s]  I could never make that sound ever again if you- if you told me to, right?
[1321.66s -> 1326.57s]  I gotta turn the camera off for that. I don't- the camera's not linked up to anything. Good game. Good game.
[1329.67s -> 1337.03s]  What did that even sound like?
[1351.37s -> 1353.86s]  Multiverses is on the Xbox,
[1353.92s -> 1356.92s]  PlayStation, and PC with complete cross-platform.
[1358.02s -> 1364.55s]  By the way, season two is out now and it's pretty damn fun.
[1372.58s -> 1374.58s]  All right, I'm gonna do-
[1374.82s -> 1379.30s]  Gizmo was fun. Let me see if I can remember how to play Gizmo. I'm not doing ranked. We're not- we're just gonna play normal.
[1379.70s -> 1391.26s]  I don't think I'm ever coming out of wood league. Let's do normal and
[1392.31s -> 1395.19s]  let's just maybe- no, no, not silly mode yet. Not silly mode.
[1398.71s -> 1401.72s]  Let me try stripe again.
[1403.32s -> 1407.54s]  Why did he squeak? I do- I-
[1407.54s -> 1418.33s]  I don't know. I don't- I couldn't make that sound ever again. I'm telling you, even if you- it doesn't matter what would happen here.
[1432.31s -> 1439.32s]  So I'm trying to think of the combos to do with stripe. It seems to be you want to get the target,
[1439.80s -> 1447.94s]  bop, bop, bop, juggle, and then do an up smash. Okay, let's go for it.
[1471.94s -> 1475.98s]  What the heck?
[1477.74s -> 1481.06s]  Was that- what happened?
[1485.02s -> 1487.38s]  Stripe's fun.
[1487.38s -> 1489.38s]  Do you want to go again or
[1490.30s -> 1491.88s]  start over?
[1491.88s -> 1495.05s]  Nah, I'm good. Okay. Well, thanks for playing.
[1498.76s -> 1504.49s]  I guess that was- we- we got it. I'll take the win, whatever.
[1507.67s -> 1520.15s]  Oh, do I have any points? No, it's okay.
[1523.94s -> 1531.85s]  I'm never doubting ever again.
[1531.85s -> 1536.33s]  Thanks for the refund. Oh, yeah. I mean, yeah, sometimes it doesn't count, right?
[1541.70s -> 1544.10s]  Is the chatbot working, by the way? Let me make sure it is.
[1553.98s -> 1556.14s]  Should be- I believe so. Okay, it should be popping up.
[1556.78s -> 1565.93s]  All right, this is versus a high level shaggy, so I gotta be- I gotta be ready for this. I'm trying to learn stripe.
[1567.61s -> 1569.77s]  I'm a gremlins franchise only player.
[1584.22s -> 1597.37s]  Oops.
[1597.37s -> 1599.37s]  Dang, when I run out of booms!
[1607.61s -> 1613.82s]  Oh! How did that block?
[1632.12s -> 1649.61s]  No! Don't! I got perfect.
[1650.25s -> 1660.82s]  Bro, he got owned. Yeah, this is a shaggy that knows what he's doing.
[1664.10s -> 1671.21s]  I got a better idea. Pulling out the LeBron.
[1678.78s -> 1683.98s]  Do I have this? Oh, I don't have that. Oh.
[1687.38s -> 1697.50s]  Oh, no, why? I'm ready.
[1704.14s -> 1715.96s]  Oh, let me pull this one out.
[1716.04s -> 1724.68s]  Yeah, there is- there's a new battle pass. Is that part- is that part of a battle pass? All right.
[1725.08s -> 1726.68s]  Let's see if I can pull this out.
[1726.68s -> 1731.10s]  I lost the ball already.
[1739.56s -> 1744.07s]  Oh, man, this is bad. It ain't over yet.
[1780.14s -> 1785.80s]  This guy's a good player. I don't- this guy's- this guy's not in wood league, okay?
[1808.01s -> 1810.01s]  It ain't over. It ain't over. It ain't over.
[1822.12s -> 1824.12s]  Oh, I'm just getting combo'd.
[1826.26s -> 1828.84s]  Oh, he's mad.
[1828.84s -> 1830.12s]  So am I.
[1830.12s -> 1832.12s]  Let's go, man.
[1832.12s -> 1847.69s]  I just fucking freaked you out for no reason. No, I want that- I need that ball. Fucking really- I'm in wood league!
[1875.75s -> 1877.75s]  Your eyes popped out of your head.
[1885.54s -> 1902.14s]  Dude, you fell off. Just fine. Does he really- he isn't- no, no, no.
[1902.22s -> 1905.26s]  I don't want to play ranked because I don't want to go up against people that can beat me bad.
[1914.23s -> 1916.23s]  I gotta stick with one character and play.
[1918.26s -> 1931.05s]  We're gonna stay on Stripe. We're not moving off Stripe for at least 25 minutes. Okay.
[1932.01s -> 2007.34s]  What's going on?
[2007.34s -> 2009.19s]  Oi!
[2009.19s -> 2010.49s]  Oi!
[2010.49s -> 2014.17s]  Stop! Don't taunt! Don't taunt! That makes me angry!
[2040.12s -> 2057.62s]  Yeah, I mean, this is a spider in the room. A huge spider just went down. You can't revoke my gamer license.
[2057.78s -> 2058.90s]  That's not fair.
[2058.90s -> 2066.82s]  I gotta get like a few warm-up games in and I- well, I am so red and it's because they can't- hold on.
[2068.62s -> 2070.62s]  I'm not this red, I swear.
[2071.62s -> 2076.82s]  Look at how red the room is! Have I emanating heat from my body?
[2081.85s -> 2085.61s]  I'm not red. My room is red. I'm not heating up the room, right?
[2087.99s -> 2090.23s]  All right. Okay, it's against level 8 Morty. Everything's gonna be fine.
[2092.52s -> 2097.85s]  Shit.
[2097.85s -> 2102.33s]  I'm starting to get it. We'll be good.
[2102.33s -> 2110.68s]  You should stand up. No, I'll fall down. I'll be good. We just gotta warm up a little. I'll get a few wins.
[2111.00s -> 2205.03s]  Was that a grenade? So many places to fall down. Damn it! Oh my god, we're on a boat!
[2234.81s -> 2337.53s]  Yeah!
[2341.83s -> 2351.02s]  Got it. Ah, that felt good. That felt good. That felt good.
[2352.06s -> 2359.53s]  Over Dean?
[2359.53s -> 2361.53s]  Yeah!
[2363.70s -> 2374.46s]  Somebody said I move around too much. I know. I do. Again, season 2 is out. It's on everything.
[2375.58s -> 2384.89s]  PC, Xbox, PlayStation. You can play this complete cross-play. It's all there. Season pass is available right now.
[2389.83s -> 2392.95s]  I like Stripe. That's gonna do better.
[2398.60s -> 2407.06s]  This was the Rick who gamed on you, is it? I gotta get my revenge. This is the Rick who's dude who absolutely just dunked on me.
[2438.94s -> 2459.99s]  Oh, it worked out!
[2462.66s -> 2469.19s]  Oh, what happened, Rick?
[2537.70s -> 2539.70s]  That's not even fair! You did a...
[2540.58s -> 2555.66s]  Whatever. I mean, it's just well known that Rick is a complete hard counter to Stripe. We all know that.
[2571.06s -> 2590.97s]  Oh, what'd I get? Oh, wait a minute. Oh, I got the astronaut Belma. Cool. I'm buying my lip too much.
[2593.61s -> 2604.57s]  Profile? 50 coins? I feel like I would like Batman a lot, but I just never get him any time.
[2605.29s -> 2613.18s]  At all. Okay, this is up next. Maybe I should change some stuff up here.
[2621.19s -> 2627.83s]  This is not... Okay. Do you remember when I played last time and I had like an 80% win rate? I've played like five games.
[2628.39s -> 2637.90s]  That's like only today. That's today. What do I got? That's cute.
[2658.63s -> 2661.91s]  Somebody said, can you please do the Stripe impression? Yeah, sure.
[2670.81s -> 2700.31s]  That'll be a thousand dollars, please. I'm kidding. Don't do that. That's not worst impression. That was pretty close.
[2730.04s -> 2738.90s]  Both had the same idea. Both brilliant players.
[2764.58s -> 2811.58s]  All right, I'm getting too fancy. Don't get too fancy. Just play. I'll just play. Oh, I got it off first. That's horseshit.
[2825.46s -> 2830.14s]  Oh, Snipe. Stripe is fun.
[2835.74s -> 2839.64s]  You're sim...
[2840.95s -> 2845.91s]  Why are you squirming around? Whenever I play a game like this, my whole body has to move back and forth.
[2845.99s -> 2847.99s]  I just have to be... I'm inside the game.
[2849.75s -> 2851.91s]  Do you guys remember back in the day when they talked about those, oh,
[2852.87s -> 2858.17s]  like, oh, you can wear this thing that when you get hit, you get hit. They like toyed with that idea.
[2858.57s -> 2860.89s]  Like it was like a dun dun dun dun dun dun dun, or something, right?
[2865.02s -> 2871.13s]  I feel like I have one of those on. Let's go back to Bugs for a little bit.
[2873.42s -> 2878.01s]  I do want to mess around with Black Adam, though. Seems like his move set's pretty fun.
[2881.46s -> 2885.16s]  Start time. Maybe Velma.
[2885.80s -> 2893.90s]  Maybe, yeah.
[2893.90s -> 2895.90s]  I played Stripe for 25 minutes.
[2897.14s -> 2901.70s]  All right, no more like high stress. I feel like I've warmed up. I feel like I'm good to go.
[2912.78s -> 2918.79s]  Don't let him do that.
[2918.79s -> 2948.30s]  What's happening? Keep letting him do it.
[2967.37s -> 2989.98s]  Careful. Oh, I thought I could just drain him. All right. Okay. All right.
[3024.82s -> 3060.34s]  Oh, sandwich versus pie. Don't let him do that!
[3060.34s -> 3063.67s]  What?
[3067.58s -> 3079.62s]  I'm not playing it up. I genuinely move around. I don't even know what I'm doing. Am I like moving too much?
[3083.30s -> 3091.72s]  That was a good fight. That was very good. Stop pretending. I'm not, I'm not pretending.
[3095.64s -> 3130.41s]  Oh, what's this? Oh, a shaggy ring out. I'm curious about what that is. Oh, that's cool. Also cool.
[3132.02s -> 3153.22s]  Oh, that's cool, too. Didn't I? What did I get? I'll do this one. This one looks good. All right, one more.
[3157.11s -> 3161.51s]  One more. Wait, what's this? I don't want to activate that yet. Okay, one more
[3162.15s -> 3170.28s]  of these will do a little bit of silly mode. You're doing video game commercial acting.
[3174.63s -> 3177.96s]  You mean when they're like this and they're like, oh,
[3178.68s -> 3199.50s]  and they're pressing buttons really hard. It really, ah, whatever. Whatever. It's fine. You need something blowing in your hair, too.
[3199.98s -> 3212.97s]  Yeah, make it some uh, fuel in me. This level is really hard. I think there's some new maps too, right?
[3220.18s -> 3252.18s]  All right. Come on, let me play.
[3275.38s -> 3329.78s]  Oh, the snipe at the end. Oops, it's on fire.
[3338.98s -> 3351.26s]  snipe
[3351.26s -> 3356.97s]  See, I just had to play a few games. Everybody said, oh my god,
[3357.45s -> 3362.65s]  this dude is awful. I can't believe this guy thinks he can play this game. What are you? This is a joke.
[3363.29s -> 3365.29s]  What do you think you're doing?
[3366.01s -> 3368.01s]  He's gonna, you gotta warm up a little bit.
[3372.82s -> 3375.46s]  I'd be careful where you put your uh, channel points at this point, guys.
[3385.77s -> 3397.74s]  Uh, you're too confident now. That's it. That's good.
[3398.22s -> 3413.19s]  Gotta have a little bit of confidence. Dude, you're still in plastic league. That's all right. I'm still, I'm still going somewhere. You go from
[3413.59s -> 3419.26s]  water to wood to plastic to steel to bronze.
[3419.91s -> 3423.91s]  I got a long way to go, but what did I just do?
[3427.34s -> 3429.34s]  Come on, pick character.
[3435.66s -> 3442.44s]  Skipping cardboard.
[3442.44s -> 3450.30s]  Dude, I guarantee you if I grinded rank, I would just be at bronze two.
[3451.22s -> 3458.10s]  I would, I would always win one, lose two, win two, lose two, win one, lose three, win three, lose four.
[3458.50s -> 3465.03s]  I would never climb. I can never get something going where I win like 10 times in a row.
[3465.67s -> 3468.74s]  I would always be bronze two or bronze one.
[3476.34s -> 3482.23s]  I get in my own head way too much in competitive games because I start doing
[3482.55s -> 3487.03s]  well and then I get a little bit too comfortable and relax a little bit and then no, no, no, I lose two in a row.
[3487.35s -> 3489.21s]  Then I get angry
[3489.21s -> 3495.37s]  and then try as hard as I can for the next two, win both of those, get confident and comfortable and relax a little, lose two in a row.
[3503.02s -> 3505.02s]  Are you, are you not fighting me?
[3505.18s -> 3507.78s]  Okay, are you, are we playing?
[3507.78s -> 3510.02s]  All right. Yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah, we're playing. We're, we are playing.
[3510.66s -> 3555.30s]  Risky.
[3555.30s -> 3564.98s]  Oh, got my static. Did you actually get that off? How did I not hit you?
[3588.73s -> 3594.33s]  Let's do it. All right. Yeah, look, you're gonna, you gotta learn how to play. I have to learn how to play.
[3595.72s -> 3603.90s]  I'm gonna play, I'll play Black Adam.
[3605.35s -> 3611.26s]  You don't know, who knows? You know, sometimes they have bad games. Sometimes you're trying to learn a character. Well, hey, hey,
[3612.14s -> 3626.71s]  relax. Okay. Oh, you're looking for a mirror.
[3628.31s -> 3660.28s]  I have no idea how to play Black Adam, but we'll try. Don't get cocky. I'm not gonna. Somebody just wrote, am I banned?
[3662.23s -> 3674.94s]  Testing to see if you're banned in the chat. Okay, here we go. See, we're good.
[3691.18s -> 3693.18s]  Black Adam is disgusting.
[3693.26s -> 3745.08s]  That's my bubble. Get out of it. We were just like two dogs playing. Just like, we're gonna play, we're running around having so much fun.
[3745.40s -> 3782.71s]  Stop. Okay, let's go again. Oh, we just died. Okay. That was fun. That was fun.
[3783.35s -> 3787.35s]  It's a fun game. It's a fun game. People are gonna play the fun game. Oh my goodness. I'm so sorry.
[3793.18s -> 3799.58s]  I, I, I had warmed up. Do silly mode.
[3803.85s -> 3813.22s]  How about one more with Stripe and then we'll do silly mode. Does Stripe have an announcer pack?
[3814.36s -> 3816.84s]  Because I have to have it, if that's the case.
[3817.56s -> 3828.42s]  What's this? That's, oh, that's good.
[3830.94s -> 3837.27s]  Anytime for three seconds after knocking back an enemy with a projectile. That's pretty good.
[3855.48s -> 3857.48s]  Uh, this is a level 13.
[3857.56s -> 3864.15s]  Uh, Garnet, so we're gonna be prepared. I don't really know Garnet's, but I forget Garnet's moves. And we've got, um,
[3864.71s -> 3866.23s]  home field advantage here.
[3866.23s -> 3876.58s]  This is, uh, it's gonna be hard.
[3876.58s -> 3916.65s]  All right, that was an extreme move. I will agree. I'm on a ride right now. This is the multi versus carnival ride.
[3917.27s -> 3927.43s]  All right, focus.
[3927.43s -> 3955.91s]  Don't do that. No, no, no, no, no.
[4084.79s -> 4109.48s]  That was such a good match too. Dude, you're a freak. Okay. I gotta, I gotta bring out something.
[4109.88s -> 4120.95s]  Good.
[4142.22s -> 4175.90s]  What's wrong with him? I'm gaming, man. Yeah, we'll do silly mode after this. All right, level 19 Batman. I gotta be prepared.
[4182.84s -> 4190.28s]  You guys having fun? All right, should I do, we'll do silly.
[4193.88s -> 4199.08s]  All right, silly Q. Do we have to pick rules or what is, uh, what is silly mode?
[4200.98s -> 4204.22s]  There's also a, I think, a versus,
[4204.70s -> 4216.09s]  like an arcade mode versus boss or something. I want to see what that is too. I, I, I don't know why I left.
[4219.58s -> 4234.73s]  Okay, so it's a 2v2 silly mode. Yeah, I'll do some 2v2s now. Refund the point.
[4236.30s -> 4252.14s]  Uh, was there, did it go through? I did. Okay, good. What is this?
[4254.57s -> 4271.30s]  Okay, I'm not gonna almost fall off the stage and squeak. I'm gonna be relaxed and we're gonna play. Okay, four ring outs.
[4276.31s -> 4278.31s]  What? Okay, so we just have big heads.
[4279.32s -> 4289.50s]  Why did Morty already lose? I don't think Morty's here.
[4291.69s -> 4305.19s]  This is truly silly.
[4305.19s -> 4313.96s]  Last box is shrinking.
[4313.96s -> 4317.16s]  Well, we didn't, I don't want to just end silly mode right now. Oh, man.
[4323.38s -> 4344.14s]  Okay, that, this is a literal 2v1. That Taz was actually holding pretty well.
[4347.94s -> 4357.88s]  Uh, yeah, I don't think we continue this. I think we go do it again. Some gold, nice.
[4369.59s -> 4371.99s]  Forget how to play with gizmo, but it's silly mode, so it's okay.
[4372.79s -> 4392.02s]  Yeah, well, no, we don't, don't run bets on, uh, on silly mode. Do a gizmo impression.
[4392.58s -> 4409.91s]  No, I did a stripe impression. Everybody told me it was embarrassing. So I, why would I do another one? Do it now.
[4420.54s -> 4427.08s]  All right, level 19, but it doesn't matter. It's silly mode. I remember gizmo being really fun.
[4453.03s -> 4461.02s]  Oh, yeah, then you shoot the popcorn. I remember. Okay. Isn't there also a little car too? Yep, there is.
[4462.20s -> 4473.88s]  I loved gizmo. Dude, I'm giving my teammate a bunch of, a bunch of juice or whatever that was.
[4474.44s -> 4500.42s]  How do I shoot the bow and arrow? I forget. Is it down?
[4501.06s -> 4526.04s]  Up? Or how do I do, how to shoot the bow and arrow? Come here, take some of this juice. Right bumper?
[4527.27s -> 4529.59s]  Oh, that's what it is. Right. Okay. I was like, where the hell is it?
[4534.33s -> 4550.58s]  Was this TV?
[4550.58s -> 4579.66s]  Oh my goodness. Where was I going? It's too silly. There it is. All right, we brought it back. Brought it back.
[4582.87s -> 4592.78s]  Take this juice. There it is. Give me a hand here. Give me a hand here. Who am I talking to?
[4597.58s -> 4601.22s]  We got it.
[4601.22s -> 4606.42s]  All right, give me a hand here. Juice over here, man. Like I'm, you know, nobody can hear me besides you guys.
[4613.78s -> 4624.90s]  Alting.
[4624.90s -> 4632.22s]  So what's, let me see the other mode. See this arcade classic?
[4633.30s -> 4638.26s]  Play a series of enemies that will take you on a journey across the multiverse. Do you have what it takes to make it to the end?
[4641.24s -> 4643.48s]  Three stages, unlimited tries. Let's, let's do medium.
[4646.41s -> 4648.71s]  What is this? It's arcade?
[4648.71s -> 4659.02s]  I wonder. So it's an adventure mode?
[4681.70s -> 4692.01s]  Okay, so let's see what this is. I'm interested. Stage one of five.
[4711.56s -> 4714.28s]  Sorry, kid. I know you got this game for Christmas, but
[4715.10s -> 4764.95s]  try to rank up here.
[4764.95s -> 4788.38s]  I know I'm doing the I'm trying really hard face, but I kind of am. Oh, that was it. There it is.
[4789.02s -> 4799.82s]  By the way, the game's also free to play. Get it right now. Season two has officially launched Xbox, PC, PlayStation.
[4799.90s -> 4801.34s]  Can I hear it please?
[4801.34s -> 4815.48s]  So it was just another round?
[4815.96s -> 4834.57s]  I'm curious what happens at the end of this. Do you get experience? I will say
[4835.53s -> 4842.97s]  Let's be completely real. I have never played an online fighting game. I would have never played this ever again. Let me be very honest.
[4843.98s -> 4850.76s]  Um, like I don't really play fighting games. I don't. The net code of fighting games is always
[4851.46s -> 4853.80s]  unbelievably awful.
[4853.80s -> 4855.54s]  This game
[4855.54s -> 4860.90s]  feels like I'm not even playing it online. It feels like I'm playing it and the person is sitting next to me in the
[4860.90s -> 4862.90s]  room with a controller plugged in.
[4863.51s -> 4866.47s]  It's just, I'm telling you that's what it is.
[4867.35s -> 4871.91s]  I've never played a fighting game that was like that. I've never done it. It's never happened.
[4872.63s -> 4877.91s]  I always play a fighting game online, have half a second of input delay, and never play it ever again.
[4877.99s -> 4880.31s]  I'm just telling you the truth. That is what has happened.
[4886.36s -> 4890.04s]  Being able to play this game and not have to think oh, I have to do my moves
[4890.92s -> 4892.84s]  like a second early.
[4892.84s -> 4894.68s]  I can't do it.
[4894.68s -> 4902.18s]  I have to be completely honest. That's honesty. It is.
[4904.98s -> 4910.18s]  When I play this when I'm playing online, it feels like the person I'm playing against is sitting right next to me
[4910.26s -> 4912.26s]  and we're trash talking a little bit.
[4917.78s -> 4922.82s]  I don't know what magical powers it takes to get the game to do that. I heard it's very difficult to get it right.
[4923.54s -> 4940.31s]  And it's very very good.
[4940.31s -> 4942.63s]  Yeah, rollback netcode. It's just good.
[4944.12s -> 4949.69s]  I would not make that up. I'm serious. The last handful of fighting games that I ever played,
[4949.77s -> 4953.93s]  I was just like I don't want to do this. It's like it's horrible in my brain. I can't do it.
[4954.49s -> 4969.19s]  All right, so what's the question mark mean?
[4969.59s -> 4971.03s]  We believe you.
[4971.03s -> 4981.96s]  You don't believe me. You don't understand. The gremlins movie is so good.
[4982.76s -> 4984.76s]  They're both good. Gremlins 2 is better than gremlins 1.
[4985.75s -> 4989.51s]  Gremlins 1 is a little more serious than gremlins 2, but gremlins 2 is just a big comedy show.
[4999.54s -> 5001.06s]  Feral gizmo.
[5001.06s -> 5037.75s]  He's a good player.
[5037.75s -> 5059.27s]  Trying to bait me. I gotta learn how to use the um saws better. I feel like I haven't been utilizing very well.
[5083.54s -> 5085.13s]  Do I do that?
[5085.13s -> 5092.34s]  I feel like I'm hearing myself. Didn't I do that? I do I I like just kind of scream make weird sounds like that.
[5092.34s -> 5093.22s]  Don't I?
[5093.22s -> 5114.46s]  Don't do that. Oh shut up.
[5115.10s -> 5127.14s]  Not you. Not you. Him. Oh my god. I lost the computer.
[5127.78s -> 5137.77s]  I just wasn't paying that much attention.
[5140.66s -> 5143.70s]  Okay, let me let me just get I'm gonna get to it. All right, let me get to the end of this
[5143.70s -> 5149.74s]  So just let me pay attention now in my brain. I didn't want to try so hard that people are like dude
[5149.74s -> 5151.74s]  Why is he trying this hard?
[5152.06s -> 5153.50s]  Against a bot
[5153.50s -> 5156.90s]  Like dude, relax, you know, this is not a player like why are you trying so hard?
[5157.22s -> 5166.90s]  So then I pulled back a little ended up losing because of that, but now i'm mad
[5178.23s -> 5187.64s]  Here we go. Check this out
[5299.51s -> 5304.14s]  Goodbye
[5304.14s -> 5307.45s]  Where's the commentary?
[5307.45s -> 5309.45s]  There's no commentary on these
[5310.33s -> 5339.46s]  Okay, so i'm almost done trying hard against a bot. Well, I want to beat this
[5339.54s -> 5347.18s]  I don't want to have to retry twice bro is mashing buttons
[5352.42s -> 5357.38s]  You know what the worst part about um, what you just said was I know that you can tell when I do that
[5358.02s -> 5360.02s]  because you hear the
[5363.38s -> 5366.57s]  Because I can hear it I wish I could turn it off because I don't want I
[5366.73s -> 5370.49s]  No, but I like having it on because I like to know when i'm not supposed to be doing something
[5370.73s -> 5373.29s]  But I I just don't want you to know that i'm messing up. You know what I mean?
[5375.37s -> 5377.93s]  It happens all the time
[5377.93s -> 5380.65s]  I don't want you to know that I screwed up. Does that make sense?
[5381.62s -> 5384.10s]  Even though it's an incredibly incredibly useful feature
[5384.66s -> 5388.15s]  I'm gonna make sure it doesn't happen this time
[5388.15s -> 5434.78s]  Is it weird that ever since i've been really conscious of you saying that i've been playing better because I don't want you to hear this
[5435.18s -> 5441.34s]  Because that's what you hear the whole time. I play this game
[5466.28s -> 5470.44s]  I you got in my head and I heard it and I all right. I'm not even listening to that person
[5482.95s -> 5485.11s]  Jesus jerma, i'm sorry. No, it's all good
[5490.92s -> 5495.24s]  Your head moves around when you do it. That should be a poker table
[5495.80s -> 5519.19s]  Well, I got I got pocket aces I would be terrible at poker. Yeah, I would get pocket aces
[5519.51s -> 5529.61s]  I'd have sunglasses on a hat hoodie zip up and pocket aces. I would just stand up and be like
[5530.17s -> 5538.78s]  Look at that. Look what I got. I wouldn't be able to contain it. I would turn around
[5538.78s -> 5540.94s]  I'd like look under again and be like whoo
[5541.50s -> 5543.58s]  I would just I'd just be a weirdo and people wouldn't know
[5546.68s -> 5550.60s]  But I would also do that if I had like a three and like a three and a six
[5552.12s -> 5555.16s]  That would work wouldn't it do you think that I could do pretty well in a tournament
[5555.93s -> 5559.85s]  If I had a three and a six and I did that I got up and did a bunch of movements pointing

[7517.78s -> 7520.18s]  You know what a harder thing you know how you would guarantee
[7521.91s -> 7524.07s]  That you would win that bet against me
[7524.39s -> 7529.19s]  Is that i'm going to make a screeching sound through my throat with my mouth closed at the end of every match
[7531.18s -> 7543.40s]  That's how you win. That's a guaranteed victory. I'll try it one more time
[7548.12s -> 7549.48s]  Here comes the heat
[7549.48s -> 7575.03s]  Is that all right?
[7575.03s -> 7587.30s]  Right there your ear is poking out

[7775.75s -> 7779.90s]  On the xbox actually show them what we got on a different account
[7788.26s -> 7794.46s]  Battle pass. Yeah season battle pass. Yeah. Yeah, there are a lot of mr. Pancakes
[7795.70s -> 7799.46s]  Is this also a mr? No, this is the snow guys. It's the same. Mr. Pancake

[7938.15s -> 7939.03s]  Oh
[7939.03s -> 7951.22s]  The spike that's a good one to go on him. That was unfortunate
[7953.37s -> 7954.97s]  Yeah, let's do another one one more
[7954.97s -> 7961.24s]  You end up getting right to the edge of the right right when I did the down and just caught him at the perfect angle
[7962.12s -> 7980.09s]  That's that was painful. I would have been annoyed at that one changing to shaggy. Okay
[7987.38s -> 7989.69s]  Game is cross play
[7989.69s -> 7995.11s]  Yeah, it does. You might run into somebody on the xbox
[7995.19s -> 8040.33s]  You might run into somebody on pc playstation really win the final match. We'll find out careful careful
[8075.30s -> 8077.30s]  Oh my god
[8078.02s -> 8135.32s]  Fine I threw so hard there. Oh, where are you going? Don't even think about it. Oh my god
[8135.64s -> 8137.64s]  He beat me
[8148.58s -> 8149.96s]  Shit

[8153.40s -> 8161.70s]  That stage is hard because all the stuff on the edge. All right, i'm fine. I'm fine. We're gonna win
[8174.07s -> 8182.07s]  Everything's good
[8182.07s -> 8190.10s]  Okay, I understand. He's he does he tries to bait you to the edge of the map so he can do the step move
[8190.82s -> 8194.34s]  And he tries to jump jump out all the way and do like that's not happening
[8194.90s -> 8199.78s]  Sorry, it's just not what we got last match of the night is right here
[8203.53s -> 8248.50s]  Okay
[8249.06s -> 8251.27s]  That's it
[8251.27s -> 8255.59s]  I told you we got this
[8255.59s -> 8257.59s]  He jumped so far out man
[8264.49s -> 8268.97s]  He did a max jump then another max jump. I am don't look at that
[8271.18s -> 8273.10s]  Good matches though. Good fight
[8273.10s -> 8284.92s]  Good fight that was a that was tense. I could feel that I toasted back this game just does it to me. I just get so
[8285.64s -> 8293.22s]  Intense when I play this hits me in a certain spot and i'm not even that good
