[0.95s -> 18.50s]  Good afternoon. How you doing? On time. Yeah. Yeah. Anybody bet on this? No bets for this?
[21.43s -> 25.27s]  Oh, okay. I figured maybe there would be a bet for that.
[28.89s -> 32.17s]  Wait, you mean I could have been like 10 minutes late? If there was a bet, I was like,
[32.17s -> 36.01s]  oh, maybe they bet on this. I better get in there and turn it on. No, I'm kidding. I'm here.
[36.01s -> 41.67s]  I'm going to play Slime Rancher again. Played it last night. I think it's great.
[42.39s -> 48.54s]  And I'm going to get my fill. So we'll see after today if that's the case.
[52.90s -> 60.09s]  After three streams on German985twitch.tv, we have to decide if I'm going to continue
[60.09s -> 66.90s]  or if three is enough. We'll find out. I do love the game though. It's a chill, fun thing to do.
[67.70s -> 74.60s]  I'm really into it. Please wish me a happy birthday. Your name is so dark I couldn't
[74.60s -> 79.70s]  even read your name. It's like a dark navy blue. It blends in with the background. I can't read it.
[80.26s -> 88.82s]  I couldn't even read your name. Happy birthday, whoever you were. What was your name?
[93.11s -> 103.85s]  Happy birthday. Can you not wish me a happy birthday? That's just every day that's not your
[103.85s -> 114.74s]  birthday. We're going to get right into this. I don't need to introduce this at all. This is
[114.74s -> 118.82s]  three streams in a row of Slime Ranchers, so I don't really need to talk that much about it.
[119.54s -> 123.90s]  There was something I wanted you guys to remind me of and I was thinking about it before I turned
[123.90s -> 132.82s]  the stream on. I have a drill, right? I have two drills. It was something else. It was the drills
[132.82s -> 144.34s]  and something else. Explain the game. These little creatures, you feed them and they shit out money.
[144.98s -> 151.16s]  That's the entire game. There's nothing else in the game. It's just collecting creatures that go
[151.16s -> 157.05s]  to the bathroom and then you make money off of their bathroom. I mean, it's pretty cool.
[159.53s -> 164.01s]  Okay, let's go. Let's go. Don't need to waste any time. Here we are. I'm already in the game.
[164.01s -> 169.72s]  I've been waiting. I've been ready. I've been sitting here the entire day just waiting for
[169.72s -> 178.12s]  exactly 2 p.m. to go through or 2 30 so I can turn it on and play. Move this a little bit. That's
[178.12s -> 184.76s]  going to distract me. Okay, it's done. Can you guys hear it? Yes, you can. We're good to go.
[187.99s -> 196.02s]  Get to the dentist. For what? I need to go to the dentist? Remember, people are going to start
[196.02s -> 204.01s]  thinking your name is actually Andy. I don't think so. I don't think they're going to think that.
[208.57s -> 214.23s]  All right, the last thing. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. The drills, the drills. We got to go to the drills.
[214.23s -> 222.12s]  All right, suck up. Your name isn't Andy. Oh, we got, okay, okay. Good, good, good. Yeah,
[222.12s -> 227.85s]  I remember the plan here. I got a lot of money. Right. No, it was buy the docs. That's what you
[227.85s -> 234.66s]  guys supposed to remind me. You guys supposed to remind me to buy the docs and take the stuff out
[234.66s -> 239.16s]  of the drill. That's not what you're doing right now. You're just saying Andy. That's not helping
[239.16s -> 253.82s]  me. It doesn't help me. I tried. No, it's not just one of you that has to try. It's like 3,000 of you
[253.82s -> 260.62s]  have to try because I can't read one person's comment. You have to all just amalgamize into
[260.62s -> 274.95s]  one comment. What about the one guy's? Yeah, but that's different. Okay, those drills are over here.
[275.51s -> 291.19s]  No, I want to get the oka oka. I need the hive mine to yell at me. Yeah. If you missed last night's
[291.19s -> 297.75s]  stream or you didn't stay the whole time, we just got crystals and we just got rad slimes
[297.75s -> 302.23s]  and I combined the crystal and the rad slime and made a crystal rad slime.
[304.12s -> 317.10s]  Oh boy, you missed it. I'm saying among us. Okay, let's go. That's sick. Why? Why are you saying
[317.10s -> 331.40s]  among us? I said that. I didn't. When did I say among us? All right, let's get some money
[337.91s -> 349.43s]  and then let's let them eat oka oka is their favorite food. Okay, I'm going to sell this.
[351.48s -> 369.34s]  Look at those crystals. Has the price gone up? I wonder you forgot what I forget. You did
[371.26s -> 380.12s]  among us in a nutshell. Oh, Michael. Oh, but what did you do? You guys got like collectively hit by
[380.76s -> 384.20s]  like the fairy godmother. Why are you guys? Oh, what's going on here? Like somebody will have
[384.20s -> 391.46s]  a wand over this chat. What are you guys doing? Are you going to kill me if I stand on that?
[396.84s -> 406.14s]  Shit. I didn't mean to do that. It'll be fine. It's the hive mind. But why? Why is the hive mind
[406.14s -> 411.42s]  saying among us? All right. I know you're a hive mind, but why is the hive mind saying among us?
[412.06s -> 419.67s]  I need an explanation for it. We're toxic.
[424.84s -> 435.75s]  Why are you guys doing this? Because we're toxic. Oh, okay. What are you doing? 38? This
[435.75s -> 443.27s]  these went down in value. I should have held. We know it pisses you off.
[445.70s -> 453.75s]  No, it doesn't. It's a joke on you. I don't care. I don't even care. They think that like it makes
[453.75s -> 459.75s]  me mad. I don't even fucking care. Oh my god. Imagine thinking like I cared about that.
[461.00s -> 466.81s]  Oh, you're really getting to me. I don't care. He was just wasting so much time saying that.
[466.81s -> 476.60s]  I don't fucking even care. I need to donate this stuff. Jerma, you're a valley girl.
[483.06s -> 492.39s]  I want to donate and then we're going to check on the drills. Yes. How am I a valley girl? What's
[492.39s -> 502.33s]  this quest? This guy. Working on a new recipe. Help me out. What does he want? Oh, those rewards
[502.33s -> 508.23s]  are terrible. I mean, eight chickens. I can go get eight chickens right now in my backyard. No,
[508.23s -> 523.06s]  not even worth it. All the upgrades are done. Let's go this way. Do it. No, I can go pick up
[523.06s -> 536.18s]  eight chickens right now in 15 seconds. It's not worth it. When he said I'm willing to pay you to
[536.18s -> 549.94s]  talk to my friend. She's anti Jerma. I don't. That's okay. I don't care. That's fine. That's
[550.58s -> 567.72s]  what you can. We don't all have to like the same TV shows. Oh, I need to donate these shit. Yes,
[567.72s -> 576.31s]  we do. No, if we all like the same TV shows, how would we argue with each other about what the best
[576.31s -> 583.05s]  TV show is? Or what season was the best? Guys, there are a lot of you. There are a lot of you.
[583.05s -> 589.53s]  There are a ton of you among us here. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. There's a
[589.53s -> 597.02s]  lot of you here that would argue about the arcs of this channel. Oh, yeah. Boston Arc was better
[597.02s -> 603.02s]  than Vegas Arc. No, no, no, no, no. Jerma Basement Arc was better than Jerma Boston Arc.
[604.41s -> 627.66s]  I mean, that happens here. Jerma Arc Tier List. Okay, there's been like two. There's been two.
[628.46s -> 633.14s]  Actually, no, there's been a there's been actually quite a few arcs, hasn't there?
[634.70s -> 648.54s]  Are they arcs or are they what would you even call them? There's seasons.
[653.03s -> 660.26s]  It'd be kind of funny to name streams with the title like seasons in them. Like I said,
[660.26s -> 665.93s]  what's the title right now? Like, oh, Slime Rancher, like getting that money.
[666.81s -> 674.49s]  Jerma Season 3 Episode 40 or something. But that season finale is like something crazy would
[674.49s -> 687.88s]  have to happen. We'd have to have season finales. Are these ready? Oh, only two minutes. All right,
[687.88s -> 695.66s]  two minutes and 27 seconds and I can get these. Catboy is season finale. I don't know if I agree.
[695.66s -> 707.21s]  I don't think I agree with that. I think Catboy would be series finale because Netflix ain't
[707.21s -> 718.98s]  picking it up for another season after that one. Netflix is going to be like,
[719.30s -> 723.80s]  we didn't like the direction of the Catboy stuff. We're no longer we're not going to be
[723.80s -> 735.48s]  renewing German N8-5 for a fourth season. All right, put these hens over here. How do I burn
[735.48s -> 741.59s]  two minutes? How do I kill two minutes? What's your opinion on the word plort? I think it's pretty
[741.59s -> 760.41s]  sick. Next question, please. What are you doing? That's your question. Hey, what are you doing?
[768.92s -> 773.88s]  Next question, please. What are you doing? What are you? What are you up to? What are you doing?
[773.88s -> 781.24s]  How are you? How are you doing? I don't know why I thought that was so funny. Look at all this.
[781.24s -> 787.30s]  This is day. Excuse me. How am I feeling? I'm feeling pretty good. It's been a good day.
[788.34s -> 790.66s]  I forgot that this existed. Now I'm going to have a lot of these.
[802.46s -> 815.02s]  You free tonight? All right, I'm not free tonight. I didn't. I got to put something over here.
[816.50s -> 820.42s]  Like, all right, what do I put over here? High walls, music box, but just do it. Air net,
[821.59s -> 826.46s]  what collector? I got to put something over here. Auto feeder. I got to get something in here.
[827.18s -> 839.16s]  What should I put over here? I'll figure it out. All right, chickens are doing good.
[839.16s -> 849.05s]  I got my mangoes. I already asked if I could sleep over and then your mom said yes. Oh, I get it.
[852.82s -> 855.46s]  Was that like an insult or something? I don't know what that means.
[856.18s -> 873.86s]  That's like an insult. What do you mean? No, he just asked. Wait, that wasn't like a,
[873.86s -> 878.66s]  hey, man, I already asked your mom if I could sleep over. She said yes, I'm sleeping over
[878.66s -> 891.93s]  your mom and your mom. That wasn't what that was. I thought that's what that was. What is this?
[891.93s -> 901.30s]  Oh, shit. There's a mango in here. That'll fill up. How are we doing? All right. Now,
[901.86s -> 913.86s]  it's two minutes going up. I think it's time to check out the drill. Real time. They asked you
[913.86s -> 919.77s]  for your mother's permission. Okay, but wouldn't your mother need to ask my mother for permission
[919.77s -> 926.89s]  to make sure it was real? In this scenario for both kids, you have to ask my mom if you
[926.89s -> 933.13s]  can sleep over. Wouldn't your parents need to be the ones to be like, hey, can Timmy sleep over
[933.13s -> 940.90s]  tonight? Like, hey, can I sleep over tonight? Well, we have to check with your mom. Yes. Yeah.
[946.15s -> 956.71s]  Ready? Oh, these are blue. Oh, no, they're not. Oh, okay, I get it. They're not different than
[956.71s -> 971.13s]  the regular ones. They just do three cycles. Okay. Oh, pretty cool. Do I sleep with? Okay.
[971.77s -> 976.17s]  I'm going to stop. We're going to stop that conversation right there.
[984.26s -> 993.48s]  You guys, what the hell are you doing? I want some more advanced drills. Don't you?
[994.28s -> 1009.98s]  What's the, what's the shit from Avatar on, on obtaining them? Advanced drill. All right,
[1009.98s -> 1013.18s]  I can make some more of these. I'm going to put one on the one I'm putting on there.
[1022.66s -> 1029.40s]  That's a real element. Unobtanium is a real element. I don't, I feel like that's a lie.
[1030.12s -> 1052.68s]  That's an unobtanium. I don't think that's real. I want crystals. I'm going to do one more cell,
[1054.89s -> 1058.41s]  and then I'm going to get out of here. I'm going to go explore. I have a, I have another key.
[1059.05s -> 1074.25s]  Among us tanium. Actually banned that person forever. I'd like actually, I'm sorry. I'm very
[1074.25s -> 1081.02s]  sorry, but you have to be banned forever. At least like for 15 minutes, like among us tanium.
[1082.90s -> 1086.50s]  How dare you? You know what I mean? Like let's just say, let's just be real. How dare you?
[1087.06s -> 1094.76s]  I want that person timed out for at least 10 minutes. It's hard for me not to say forever.
[1094.76s -> 1101.14s]  What if 10 minutes? I don't even know who said it. And I may have added extra syllables and extra
[1101.14s -> 1104.74s]  words to it. I find the person that started me down that path and I want them out of here for
[1104.74s -> 1128.12s]  15 minutes. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to.
[1136.49s -> 1140.01s]  I don't even need these hens. Does anybody eat meat over here? Somebody does down here.
[1140.65s -> 1159.61s]  You can't ban us all. No, you're right. I can't, I cannot ban you all. I can't, but I can.
[1161.62s -> 1170.98s]  There's some things I can do. I can put it into sub only, five minute slow mode, and then that's
[1170.98s -> 1185.24s]  goodbye. Can't hear you anymore. Okay, good. We'll have one more haul to deliver.
[1186.04s -> 1197.82s]  I know these guys have a shitload. Yes, they do. Not really. Do it. No, I'm not. I just, I can do
[1197.82s -> 1208.36s]  it. That doesn't mean I'm going to do it. It means I can. Oh, I wonder if I should. No, I'll just
[1208.36s -> 1214.07s]  sell if he cares. All right. Now I'm going to buy the dock and we're going to go through the dock.
[1214.71s -> 1228.31s]  Oh yeah. 15 grand. I'm going to go, I'm going to sleep and we're going to go to the dock and
[1228.31s -> 1242.25s]  here we go. I'm a dog that just got out of the bath. I had to really shake violently around.
[1242.25s -> 1246.52s]  The point where you look at the dog and you're like, does their brain shake around like crazy
[1246.52s -> 1258.54s]  when they do that? Doesn't that give them a headache? All right. The dock was down here,
[1258.54s -> 1272.73s]  right? When a dog shakes that like, you know what I'm talking about? They shake, shake, shake.
[1272.73s -> 1279.94s]  It starts off kind of slow. It's like shake, shake, shake, shake. That seems like it would be like,
[1279.94s -> 1288.90s]  holy shit, that's fast. No, no, no, growling. Like that's the vibrations of them shaking.
[1289.46s -> 1298.62s]  Here we go. The docks deep down in the great blue sea. I saw a thousand slimes smiling back at me.
[1298.62s -> 1309.00s]  Let's go. Dock. What? Here we go. Boys and girls. Oh my God. Oh, it's just another area. Okay. Fuck.
[1309.00s -> 1316.66s]  I didn't even need to do this. There was, is that, there's nothing here? Oh, it's just extra space.
[1317.38s -> 1331.70s]  Well, I don't even need this. Not, at least not now. You got baited. Well, not really. So where
[1331.70s -> 1354.87s]  can I use this other key? Where do I use the key? You need to sing a raid song? Thanks for the raid.
[1354.87s -> 1362.38s]  Who, who raided? C or Max. Thanks for the raid. Welcome everybody. Playing, uh, I almost just said
[1362.38s -> 1367.58s]  playing among us. Yeah, currently playing among, you guys keep fucking saying it and then you keep
[1367.58s -> 1372.46s]  writing it. You're burning it into my head. I just, it's, it's half of every message.
[1372.46s -> 1379.64s]  It's half of every single message. Every single one. I can't get, I can't, I can't get away from
[1379.64s -> 1389.99s]  it. It's all I can read. All right. I need to, I need to open up a door. Wait, couldn't I,
[1389.99s -> 1394.78s]  didn't I get a treasure unlocking ability thing? I did, didn't I? All right. I need to, I'm going
[1394.78s -> 1403.42s]  to open up a door. Where is there another door I can open? I have a, I have two keys, don't I?
[1403.42s -> 1411.10s]  I have one key. Isn't there one down here? I swear to God there is. I swear to God. Yeah, there it is.
[1411.10s -> 1420.52s]  All right, cool. Let's go. I'm going to open this up. What's this way? I don't know. Why would I, is
[1420.52s -> 1429.22s]  this, should I get this? I don't know if this is like worth doing. This doesn't look worth it.
[1431.56s -> 1442.33s]  I got to go back here and then open this over here. This is a shortcut. Yeah, I gotta get the
[1442.33s -> 1446.01s]  last area. All right. I'm going to go back to here. We'll go back to the crystal place.
[1446.01s -> 1465.82s]  Okay. Yeah. Back to the crystal place. I already unlocked that area. Yeah. Is there a cave that I
[1465.82s -> 1476.84s]  can open a door? Because I got the two keys last time. Ban the word among us. You know, that sounds
[1476.84s -> 1484.20s]  fantastic, actually. That sounds like a great idea. That sounds like a fantastic idea.
[1492.90s -> 1509.96s]  Among us. Why? You know, I, when I watch like meme compilation videos and a bunch of shit about
[1509.96s -> 1513.40s]  Among Us pops up and I'm in a room with more than one or two people, I have to pretend to know what
[1513.40s -> 1520.23s]  their laugh, but what's, what's funny about it. And I'm just like, Oh yeah. I mean like, I don't
[1520.23s -> 1531.38s]  know that crew member. I have no idea what's going on. Are you five? What do you mean? Watching
[1531.38s -> 1539.74s]  meme compilation videos? What's wrong? Is there nothing wrong with that? Wait, wait, wait, wait,
[1539.74s -> 1543.50s]  wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Everybody, I want to, I'm silenced.
[1543.50s -> 1550.30s]  I need to go over this. You guys have not had auto play on and you just don't care what plays next.
[1550.86s -> 1556.06s]  And eventually it always leads back to a meme compilation video. Eventually, even like a few
[1556.06s -> 1568.06s]  hours could go by and then somehow for some reason that cannot be explained you end up on the daily
[1568.06s -> 1575.98s]  dose of internet video page and you just let them play and you don't stop you just sit there for like
[1575.98s -> 1586.23s]  two hours you don't it doesn't even it could be four hours you just sit there i didn't i didn't
[1586.23s -> 1589.83s]  click on that it just it was like oh this is like auto playing and this is this video is next and
[1589.83s -> 1595.91s]  the autoplay roulette and then this and then here we are the daily dose of internet here we go i'm
[1595.91s -> 1601.50s]  just i guess i'm just what's gonna i'm gonna be it's gonna be on tv for like an hour but i've
[1601.50s -> 1607.58s]  reached the controller and like turn it off like on my like tv or my ipad or my iphone i could
[1608.95s -> 1643.13s]  but how am i kind of wipe my ass don't you see uh like an iphone propped up with like two or three
[1643.13s -> 1650.17s]  tubes of toothpaste on the sink facing me while i'm sitting there just like enjoying myself

[2083.51s -> 2087.99s]  play i think i could look into the camera and smile big and be like man that was pretty sus to
[2087.99s -> 2100.89s]  me i'd get a hundred thousand concurrent viewers that's brilliant and then and then and then ban
[2100.89s -> 2115.90s]  every new account that came in that day before that after that okay no then ban all accounts

[2160.62s -> 2173.13s]  oh my god go like a news program you understand that being the imposter is sus guy requires no
[2173.13s -> 2181.53s]  work from me at all i just have to be that guy i just have to be that guy on some form of imagery
[2181.53s -> 2198.47s]  i don't have to do anything set for life all i need to do is just do one imposter is sus guy
[2200.25s -> 2208.82s]  has a stream and have like $20 tts donations that trigger a tts and i think i would probably
[2208.82s -> 2217.34s]  be able to just retire forever sus for life
[2225.13s -> 2232.36s]  sus for life but the thing is though i i would never do that because i would wake up on my like
[2232.36s -> 2237.64s]  i don't know i could be like it would be like a 45th birthday or something i would wake up in a
[2237.64s -> 2245.08s]  cold sweat and be like i'm no what happened face i would just see that face i would see it
[2245.08s -> 2249.88s]  everywhere i would look at every brushing my teeth in the mirror with that smile like just smiling
[2249.88s -> 2265.54s]  and be like that image is that's me that's sus okay i'm good i got 12 000 let's see okay let's go
[2266.10s -> 2278.79s]  wait what do you think i'm worth okay let me ask you a question so if let's just say
[2279.51s -> 2282.79s]  like let's say i have put a price tag on like me being in like an imposter
[2283.35s -> 2289.27s]  video right like some youtuber or streamer wanted to do like oh i i love i'm a bit i love among us
[2289.27s -> 2293.75s]  i play it all the time man i wonder if i could get that imposter is sus guy on my stream to like
[2293.75s -> 2297.05s]  like i open like the closet and he's smiling there what do you think that's worth
[2297.91s -> 2305.69s]  how much could i sell that for you think what could i actually get from that like 100k
[2305.69s -> 2311.61s]  10k at best that's a lot of fucking money like 10k just to be the guy like the imposter is sus like
[2312.33s -> 2316.09s]  in like somebody's like bathroom vent or something they like show the camera and like i'm like in
[2316.09s -> 2326.68s]  their like ac unit like looking out like it's 10 000 i'm like they pan up like in their bedroom
[2326.68s -> 2338.62s]  and i'm like in like the ac vent why did i just collect all that money i need to hold on that
[2338.62s -> 2348.46s]  would be 50k big subs we had 25 from soda cat 10 from albion thank you guys thanks everybody

[2398.17s -> 2419.30s]  among us sus you know the reason why i say that is because i i don't i don't really address
[2419.30s -> 2424.26s]  the sus stuff because i mean like wow whatever if people it's memed it's gone into the meme
[2424.26s -> 2428.26s]  stratosphere whatever i don't care it's out of my hands completely have fun with it fine okay
[2428.26s -> 2434.74s]  whatever i don't care uh but like kentucky fried chicken tweeted it up like the the spanish kentucky
[2434.74s -> 2439.22s]  fried chicken chicken put the sus guy as colonel sanders i think i could probably make some money

[2607.99s -> 2613.29s]  like yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean you just you're just smiling into a camera and it's like a meme

[3847.48s -> 3858.49s]  it's this way and then go through here shoot it in there and then we get to run back again and do
[3858.49s -> 3877.37s]  it again we get to do it again do it again check your diaper check your diaper i do appreciate the
[3877.37s -> 3903.53s]  uh what's the what is that mario something i would need the boom floor where is it always red
[3903.53s -> 3932.22s]  where are the other ones ah all right no and tabby and then where's the you are no
[3934.20s -> 3985.88s]  bad bounce what wrong one where's tabby where's tabby where's tabby where's tabby left of the
[3985.88s -> 4015.98s]  sus portal get out of here god damn it okay i just what so what is this one this is the flying one
[4015.98s -> 4023.83s]  okay then let's get that door open left of the sus portal and i knew exactly what they were
[4023.83s -> 4028.89s]  talking about it didn't even take me one second to figure that out it was immediate i knew what he
[4028.89s -> 4056.87s]  was talking about immediately all right let's go get it need uh fruits still not just a few
[4056.87s -> 4060.55s]  we'll fill it up get the treasure pod yep
[4073.51s -> 4097.64s]  okay uh one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve okay time to get the door
[4097.64s -> 4116.70s]  open the treasure and get the drills yes that is exactly what i'm going to do right now after i go
[4116.70s -> 4132.34s]  the wrong way you know how many onions are probably over there so many say onion ring
[4142.06s -> 4161.18s]  okay and the treasure pod minty grass patch um no nothing in there 1080 omega logad whatever
[4163.85s -> 4186.71s]  all right return sell store go among amongian rings you know i might as well just lean into
[4186.71s -> 4196.26s]  it today because that's how i i i don't know what happened look at all those onions why today though
[4197.00s -> 4212.17s]  what happened today that meme has been around for months why today i didn't start this you
[4212.17s -> 4224.57s]  were acting sus no i wasn't i didn't do anything why not yesterday how come you didn't do this
[4224.57s -> 4234.78s]  yesterday i streamed yesterday what happened in like 12 hours holy shit whoa oh my god there's a
[4234.78s -> 4257.27s]  lot of stuff in here deep brine hexa comb strange diamond cool i need to it's overgrown
[4258.23s -> 4271.10s]  i'm gonna stuff this in the auto feeder look man we don't choose when you are sus or not
[4272.06s -> 4286.60s]  it's true i'm gonna build some drones i do what happened it's okay it's okay it's okay it's okay
[4286.60s -> 4293.14s]  it's all right it's okay i don't know what i just did i think he has to die does he no he can just
[4293.14s -> 4307.78s]  be the one that rules them all okay that's fine i need that i need that though shit that out oh
[4307.78s -> 4330.17s]  my god 91 okay thank you you can go back in don't go over there okay we're good he's gonna turn them
[4330.17s -> 4345.80s]  all yeah he is he is yep he's gotta go yeah get him out he's gonna turn them all yes my mistake
[4345.80s -> 4377.58s]  is your demise i'm sorry he can fly he's fine oh my god there's a hundred in here all right i
[4377.58s -> 4402.47s]  think i i don't need to feed these guys anymore oh i just heard something a glass break roommate
[4402.47s -> 4407.51s]  ejected okay i'm actually i'm not going to read anymore i'm not going to read anymore among us
[4407.51s -> 4414.97s]  posts you wanted to talk about among us take it take it somewhere else take it somewhere else
[4415.53s -> 4434.47s]  okay i just need one of these let's go sleep get for it let's get for it i don't know what that
[4434.47s -> 4452.26s]  means let's go for it and get it he can't ban us all no yes i can with just a simple snap up my
[4452.26s -> 4473.02s]  fingers you guys would just be fucking gone this way no more fortnight yeah i'm gonna take away
[4473.02s -> 4486.49s]  your fortnight privileges you want to keep this up no more fortnight you're only gonna get to
[4486.49s -> 4500.17s]  build you only get to play educational games not fortnight all right we're gonna go up left straight
[4505.08s -> 4534.15s]  fortnight is educational i want these slimes is he gold no i just want the slimes that's all i want
[4534.15s -> 4540.65s]  and we still probably play super frog of course you can play super frog i almost just died i didn't
[4540.65s -> 4547.85s]  have any energy left yeah you can play super frog that's completely fine absolutely super frog
[4547.85s -> 4563.27s]  teaches you uh skills it teaches you about oh my goodness should probably help them although
[4563.27s -> 4570.31s]  you're right it does got candy it does have candy it teaches you educational number counting
[4570.31s -> 4587.48s]  but it does have candy in it everyone good good how could you not like it yeah but it
[4588.04s -> 4601.27s]  candy's not good for your teeth hey what the heck's going on with this how come there's no
[4601.27s -> 4610.57s]  video game where you have actually like use the analog stick to brush your teeth there's no brushing
[4610.57s -> 4616.78s]  teeth in video games i've never played a video game where like you brush your teeth with like
[4616.78s -> 4627.14s]  the controller why have they never done that it seems like kind of fun no not i'm not talking
[4627.14s -> 4632.58s]  about wario where i'm talking about like a 3d game rpg or something you go and you spit you
[4633.54s -> 4653.34s]  spit use the actual analog stick to brush you can do that in heavy rain
[4654.78s -> 4666.14s]  i have to play it it'd be fun one time no you could do like a red dead redemption thing with it
[4667.27s -> 4671.19s]  where if you just didn't brush your teeth they turned like brown or something or like gray
[4673.86s -> 4679.70s]  like over time you don't like clean you just have these like gray brown teeth like yellow teeth
[4680.42s -> 4698.74s]  all right we're finally gonna open this door see what happens that's it now um
[4720.68s -> 4729.00s]  into the past all that is lost is eventually found and lost once more okay any new slimes
[4729.00s -> 4743.77s]  it's this thing i don't know if i should press this what is all this where am i on the map
[4743.77s -> 4770.46s]  oh press it press it hold on okay um i can open doors we're going further into the temple
[4771.26s -> 4785.16s]  is these weird hologram things all over the place excuse me new slime give us a new slime
[4785.72s -> 4795.70s]  give us a new slime give us it give us every once it oh yeah yeah yeah yeah quantum slime
[4799.77s -> 4828.79s]  quantum slime hurry get as many as i can quantum crystal is the new play cool what do quantums eat
[4838.66s -> 4848.18s]  oh we're going this way like oh oh this is gonna freak me out all right how about down here
[4848.18s -> 4862.57s]  what is over here anything read my lips what about this tree oh can i open it nice something
[4862.57s -> 4867.13s]  valuable come on i deserve it a sunburst sweet
[4885.58s -> 4899.77s]  let's try to get a good like 10 20 20 quantum slimes i'll take the puddles
[4900.81s -> 4923.05s]  you know i like them oh what's this a red echo oh red echo how far into the game are you
[4924.39s -> 4930.04s]  um i believe this is the final area so i've unlocked all the areas i don't know exactly
[4930.04s -> 4934.36s]  how much is left but i mean enough for me to like just mess around and sell things and buy things
[4934.36s -> 4952.55s]  and there's another one oh pink echoes i need that device that shows you the map
[4953.59s -> 4960.90s]  whoa this is like this is quantum fruit how do i turn this on look this is like a quantum fruit
[4960.90s -> 4972.92s]  tree how do i get that to work they probably eat these they eat fruit okay hit it with a fruit
[4973.82s -> 4997.34s]  okay one whoa a phase lemon holy shit okay that's definitely their favorite food
[4997.98s -> 5003.40s]  there's no way a phase lemons not a quantum slime's favorite food oh i gotta go back
[5004.20s -> 5021.77s]  i gotta get out of here i gotta go but is there another slime to get here hold on come here
[5022.41s -> 5025.70s]  and there's another treasure trove there
[5025.70s -> 5029.11s]  here
[5029.11s -> 5042.42s]  can't open it though lava i i'm gonna get it there's a treasure pod oh i don't have any room
[5042.42s -> 5057.99s]  no what do i do oh shit i don't want to open this what if it's good i don't want to get rid of the
[5057.99s -> 5074.17s]  puddles is it good okay we're fine urgent grass patch i want at least 20 slimes before i go
[5074.17s -> 5090.78s]  anywhere i want 20 of the slimes i want 20 of them we have to do a lot of uh slime combination
[5090.78s -> 5102.98s]  here how do we get out of here you have 21 you don't need the echo i don't what do you mean
[5106.25s -> 5114.65s]  where's the among us what nine plus ten is 21 quantum slime echo is a decoration
[5115.21s -> 5132.68s]  echo is a cosmetic decoration it's a lie that's a lie that's definitely a lie you just you want
[5132.68s -> 5140.22s]  to shoot it into the ocean so you can write omega low like 100 of you oh wait a minute what's this
[5140.22s -> 5170.31s]  what do they love phase lemons are their favorite i gotta grow phase lemons
[5170.87s -> 5177.86s]  feed him an echo i know what that is now but i need to feed him a fruit so he shows up on the map
[5179.08s -> 5185.08s]  anything really this is like okay no no i don't i know where he is i'll put like the weird lake
[5185.08s -> 5198.22s]  up here okay i don't remember how to get out of here you have a phase lemon i'm not shooting that
[5198.22s -> 5215.05s]  i want to grow these i need to see what that lava is though right we gotta go over there
[5215.77s -> 5235.74s]  i need to see what this is or we get out of the way what's the lava it's a lava slime
[5235.74s -> 5244.84s]  that's a boom gordo he eats meat oh wait wait i want to be able to mark this
[5244.84s -> 5268.81s]  can't like bounce it off the wall go around idiot and i i mean go we need to go around
[5275.77s -> 5304.02s]  all right just go around go go where's the button to press this need to open that door through the
[5304.02s -> 5321.91s]  door what door fly over the wall hold on grab more quantums um every time i see him i'm trying
[5321.91s -> 5347.24s]  to pick him up ah yes i'm out thank goodness oh there's the teleporter all right now
[5352.26s -> 5361.34s]  i don't know what i did all right i gotta where's that gordo is over here where is he he's in here
[5361.34s -> 5376.36s]  right he's right there so can i go around here like where do i go let's see he's in there the
[5376.36s -> 5387.00s]  door is open dropped from what do you mean the door is open door is open door the door is open
[5388.09s -> 5421.05s]  oh the door the door the door is open now he's marked now i know where he is thank you
[5421.77s -> 5430.66s]  the other guy's like right here the door is cosmetic it is not cosmetic and i'll like it
[5430.66s -> 5438.44s]  actually get me out of here and i'm gonna do some quantum slime computing you guys know that the
[5438.44s -> 5451.03s]  quantum computing stuff you guys hear about that isn't the whole scary thing with quantum computing
[5451.03s -> 5456.95s]  that it can like crack your password in like three seconds can't can a quantum computer crack
[5456.95s -> 5468.63s]  any password in like less than a day or something what we're gonna do pick him up what the fuck
[5468.63s -> 5488.18s]  we're gonna cry no not even close what do you mean not even close quantum computing also allows
[5488.18s -> 5494.04s]  for ultimate privacy ultimate ultimate privacy well i don't have a quantum computer i'm not
[5494.04s -> 5497.42s]  going to be able to have when they first come out the person with the first quantum computer
[5497.42s -> 5515.64s]  is gonna get everybody's password i got 27 quantum slimes is there does it i gotta get
[5515.64s -> 5525.99s]  that teleporter all right all right all right let's make this happen quantum quantum computing
[5525.99s -> 5533.98s]  has been around since before you were born jeremy yeah but just because this one in some random
[5533.98s -> 5541.58s]  nasa warehouse when we all have one when it fits inside of your hand like a smartphone
[5541.58s -> 5557.75s]  it's not how it works yeah and guess what 40 50 years ago we didn't think that we'd be able to
[5557.75s -> 5571.62s]  send our voices through the air to each other that that's that's fucked up isn't it a radio
[5572.42s -> 5578.82s]  no you know i hold on a minute we're not talking about radio we're talking about i can i can through
[5578.82s -> 5585.46s]  the air to satellite to satellite call you if you're in tokyo and i'm in vegas and we can have a
[5585.46s -> 5591.85s]  clear perfectly normal conversation i'm not talking about like hey hey hold on
[5605.77s -> 5613.54s]  yeah and they're like 200 feet away from each other yeah telephone goes through wires
[5613.54s -> 5619.51s]  what do you mean the telephone yeah the telephone went through a wire into the wall
[5619.51s -> 5637.18s]  through into the ground this overgrowing fruit the internet is wires not wireless internet
[5637.18s -> 5643.19s]  that sounded like i was elvis oh look at all these puddle slides we're gonna put it here
[5650.74s -> 5657.91s]  mobile phones eventually go to wires i don't even know that yeah i okay i took a networking
[5657.91s -> 5667.94s]  class in college i took networking one i learned how to crimp a ethernet cable so okay okay so
[5667.94s -> 5689.14s]  what you're but you know right i was in like 1989 look at all these cute little ports networking
[5689.14s -> 5695.94s]  andy oh shit i don't have any more crystals because i turn them into rad crystals well
[5695.94s -> 5700.42s]  looks like we're getting rid of some shit what are we getting rid of oh i know we're getting
[5700.42s -> 5708.26s]  rid of out here does quantum need something special because it is time to get rid of the cats
[5709.24s -> 5713.77s]  didn't i get rid of the cats already why are they still here wait what happened
[5713.77s -> 5719.91s]  i thought i got rid of these already oh i made a new plot that's right that's right that's right
[5719.91s -> 5729.29s]  i know where it is are they gonna phase out of existence if i put them in here are they
[5729.29s -> 5742.68s]  gonna disappear let me read quantum quantum slimes appear to have resulted from some sort
[5742.68s -> 5748.34s]  of event that took place in the ancient ruins long ago yep at all times the quantum slime
[5748.34s -> 5754.50s]  is capable of admitting other possible realities of their being called ghosts these other realities
[5754.50s -> 5760.66s]  can come true with the quantum slime aligning with the reality of the ghost effectively teleporting
[5760.66s -> 5766.30s]  quantum slimes can be one of the most difficult slimes to manage given the unique abilities a
[5766.30s -> 5770.94s]  rancher needs to learn to detect when quantum slimes are primed to take over the reality of a
[5770.94s -> 5776.30s]  ghost and i quickly such as feeding them or just splashing them with some fresh water as a temporary
[5776.30s -> 5794.74s]  measure so i have to keep them fed these guys got to be kept fed or they will just disappear
[5794.74s -> 5802.54s]  at all times read puddle slime puddle slimes aren't risky to manage they just require a fair
[5802.54s -> 5806.62s]  bit of maintenance a rancher needs a pool of fresh water like a pond available for a puddle
[5806.62s -> 5811.35s]  slime and it's plorts to sit in as they will evaporate it away from water finally puddle
[5811.35s -> 5815.03s]  slimes are exceptionally shy and will not produce plorts if they're in close proximity more than
[5815.03s -> 5821.69s]  three others hopes overall pulse time is barefoot yeah just sleepy okay so i have to i can only have
[5821.69s -> 5827.64s]  four ocean no no no no no no no come back here i don't want you to teleport out of reality all
[5827.64s -> 5841.99s]  right i'm not i gotta hold on to the quantum slimes for a little bit what's that i need to plant uh
[5842.07s -> 5855.70s]  garden we are replacing mint fruit with phase lemon in fact we are going to do two phase lemon
[5855.70s -> 5879.32s]  gardens folks this is right here they're right over there oh i said a bad idea it's they're
[5879.32s -> 5886.87s]  right here what's wrong with my brain i want i want a ton of production of that fruit i want
[5886.87s -> 5903.06s]  to be able to constantly keep an auto feeder going on going on that thing mint fruit gang rebel
[5903.06s -> 5930.90s]  eat mint mangoes please read about echoes get rid of the cats already um okay hold on let me
[5934.34s -> 5942.02s]  these guys eat fruit so i mean i could here's what we're going to do i that that that that that that
[5942.02s -> 5953.98s]  stop it quiet they eat fruit i'm going to just load this up we're going to put the quantum slimes
[5953.98s -> 5979.64s]  in here and start production hey they eat fruit so i can fill that up they'll be eating here we go
[5979.64s -> 5986.47s]  plenty of food let's go way too many you're going to be in trouble how the fuck did you
[5986.47s -> 5990.63s]  how they why they're flying why are they floating away why are they floating away
[5990.63s -> 5993.83s]  give me give me give me give me give me give me give me give me give me give me give me give me
[6000.84s -> 6018.23s]  why are they flying away feed them i was feeding them it's fake what oh wait i have 27 still
[6018.87s -> 6038.14s]  all right feed feed them before they all leave hurry up and feed them with the auto feeder
[6040.55s -> 6058.12s]  feed them why's i'll do it these things are freaking me out they really are they're just
[6058.12s -> 6065.75s]  spreading out everywhere all right i got gold plorts i got quantum plorts hell yeah
[6066.71s -> 6077.53s]  let's uh keep feeding gold plorts now i'm gonna do i need crystals or maybe another one maybe i'll
[6077.53s -> 6093.58s]  save it water then water quick water quick do i have to do i have to do this save how often do
[6093.58s -> 6105.56s]  i have to do that you don't need to do that if you keep them fed okay that's what we're gonna do
[6107.90s -> 6113.06s]  all right so that i got the i got all right i gotta keep that filled i'm gonna keep that
[6113.06s -> 6120.36s]  filled up we're gonna go stuff it in there wow this game is like seriously can we give like
[6120.36s -> 6127.00s]  how do we get the developers of this game like a hundred million dollars to like make more stuff
[6127.08s -> 6147.38s]  like this okay looks good how much do these sell for that's what i want to know i'm very interested
[6147.38s -> 6153.03s]  in this all right let's go back for a sec i want to see what the quantum plorts sell for
[6154.34s -> 6159.54s]  and then i'm going to get crystal ports i'm gonna make maybe not is there is am i missing
[6159.54s -> 6175.08s]  the slime that's in there 118 is there another uh is there a new thing i can get i have so much
[6175.08s -> 6192.47s]  money you never read what the echoes do that's that cool i'm kidding relax within the crumbling
[6192.47s -> 6197.75s]  walls of the ancient ruins small traces of energy can be found never staying in one place for very
[6197.75s -> 6203.67s]  long called echo ease they are believed to be a phenomenon resulting from some kind of ancient
[6203.67s -> 6208.31s]  event since they are harmless echoes are often collected by ranchers as good luck charms are
[6208.31s -> 6213.11s]  used as decorations echoes appear regularly in the nooks and crannies of the ancient ruins
[6213.11s -> 6218.47s]  as well as from extractors echoes can be used as decorations simply vac them up and shoot them
[6218.47s -> 6242.15s]  anywhere you want they'll hover in that spot until you vac them up cool oh puddle porch
[6244.63s -> 6249.48s]  one two three four five seven eight nine eleven twelve do i sell these or hold on to them
[6249.48s -> 6270.20s]  maybe i'll sell sell seven sell more more more i just need one two i need one all right i gotta
[6270.20s -> 6274.36s]  go get another okay is there another slime in that area where it just was there's like a lava
[6274.36s -> 6294.07s]  slime or something right you have sugar hands guys all fed sugar hands there are more areas
[6294.07s -> 6300.38s]  oh okay all right now this is what we're gonna do i'm gonna bring a shitload of meat and a shitload
[6300.38s -> 6307.85s]  of fruit what was the where are what were they it was this guy which is meat and then there's this
[6307.85s -> 6319.13s]  guy which was fruit he loves these things i'm gonna i'm gonna bring these and i need 15 of
[6319.13s -> 6337.27s]  these right there it is i can now feed that guy 25 shit okay when i said upgrade the seven z
[6337.27s -> 6360.81s]  rewards oh yeah i have a lot of money path upgrade torch upgrade rewards promo station

[9045.26s -> 9056.81s]  the teleporter up here all the way at the top i have enough i don't know i'm not picking anything
[9056.81s -> 9071.43s]  up i need 44 hens i think you're actually i think you're right 31 i'll get it by the time i get

[9683.50s -> 9712.73s]  sick i know i have to pee just wait i'm busy that leads us to here which is all the way up here
[9712.73s -> 9720.22s]  open this go through this thing which leads me to here which leads me to here and then i turn this
[9720.22s -> 9730.78s]  way which leads me to here which leads me to here i go over here that leads me to here and then i go

[9809.98s -> 9815.50s]  once you cross over you'll be in truly untamed country the beautiful the other side can be an
[9815.50s -> 9827.16s]  unforgiving place oh okay all right activate it oh we got a fill with quantum quantum plorts

[11067.77s -> 11081.67s]  let me just see what's at the end of the rainbow here what's at the end of the rainbow two doors
[11081.67s -> 11085.75s]  beatrix left is filled with moments where though there's two doors and you can only choose one what
[11087.70s -> 11091.54s]  i came to the far far range because a search for the unknown is in my bones
[11092.55s -> 11097.45s]  and in time even a thousand light years away from earth wasn't enough so i searched for secrets
[11097.45s -> 11108.07s]  within the ancient ruins that led me here this place was my ticket to go even further there's
[11108.07s -> 11115.99s]  door left or right the ruins are actually great engines that allow for travel through space and
[11115.99s -> 11122.17s]  maybe even time after years of study i knew how to activate them and i alone would be the first
[11122.17s -> 11128.65s]  to cross over into the true beyond it was the ultimate adventure but then there's that other
[11128.65s -> 11134.41s]  door i met thor and fell in love what are the chances of that she had a piece of my heart and
[11134.41s -> 11142.89s]  the universe had the other two doors beatrix all right that one has like a space pod in it
[11142.89s -> 11159.06s]  what's this one have it's the same door it's actually the same door at least the same place
[11159.06s -> 11178.15s]  the same door didn't have to choose it's actually the and we've got weird pork you pine fruits
[11178.79s -> 11201.61s]  i need to fill my water i chose my door i went back to the ranch and promptly sold it
[11201.61s -> 11205.85s]  i packed my things and took a tour of this beautiful land one last time leaving these
[11205.85s -> 11211.13s]  little notes for you there's time i said goodbye to the get your fucking mouse off the screen life
[11211.13s -> 11216.98s]  i had my hands and feet tingled as i approached this monolithic warp terminal what lay ahead of
[11216.98s -> 11223.22s]  me was an adventure unlike anything i'd ever known in my life stepped on the platform my heart racing
[11224.10s -> 11238.55s]  but i didn't go i had packed for a new adventure but it wasn't going to be beyond space and time
[11239.64s -> 11242.84s]  so i said a little goodbye to what could have been and headed to thor's ranch
[11243.56s -> 11248.49s]  i'm looking forward to hearing the sound of those wind chimes i've never been in love before and
[11248.49s -> 11254.42s]  never known anything yet you're fucking up my goddamn monologue i like it it's time i got to
[11254.42s -> 11259.94s]  knowing what all the fuss is about so good luck to you beatrix as always remember to use your head
[11259.94s -> 11269.34s]  but let your heart do the thinking every now and again it might surprise you well i chose my door
[11269.98s -> 11292.74s]  it didn't work out though choose the door there is i you know i think this guy got to the end
[11292.74s -> 11298.10s]  and realized there's nothing here and then decided to write this uh yeah i chose there's nothing here
[11298.10s -> 11300.98s]  there's supposed to be like a teleporter leading to like another time period or something
[11300.98s -> 11306.57s]  nothing here but uh i guess i'm gonna have to like say that they was my adventure along the way
[11307.13s -> 11320.02s]  just leave breadcrumbs and say like yeah i chose my door you choose your door uh there's a giant
[11320.02s -> 11324.18s]  x on the ground there is no treasure on the ground beatrix no treasure in there i've already looked
[11325.19s -> 11335.50s]  the map is fucking useless all right get rid of the hens i want whatever this is a cool pair
[11336.14s -> 11345.64s]  i'd want if you chose your door is that all that's over here i think that's all i can do
[11346.78s -> 11352.84s]  cool all right well i chose there's a huge beam on it though i don't believe that
[11353.48s -> 11377.93s]  go check your emails no it's the same door no what they're trying to say is all paths might
[11377.93s -> 11394.12s]  lead to the same outcome you still got there i'm really kind of disappointed there's no
[11394.12s -> 11400.07s]  teleporter that can get the hell out of here and go back to earth all drains lead to the ocean
[11400.07s -> 11409.46s]  do they i don't know it has it gets like processed
[11414.54s -> 11429.78s]  i'm peter my name is peter this is your play through oh that's fucking terrifying
[11430.66s -> 11448.73s]  you can't do minus four only minus two works check the emails i'm going back to the emails
[11448.73s -> 11460.74s]  i'm gonna check the emails i got slimes to take care of all right give me out i've got a lot of
[11460.74s -> 11469.82s]  i've got a lot of science science projects to do i gotta get out of here down i'm stuck
[11469.82s -> 11531.59s]  how do i get out of here um this map doesn't really help me at all i get up there that way
[11536.86s -> 11547.86s]  5g gum can you make the diablo 2 barbarian shouts again um okay
[11552.17s -> 11568.36s]  oh
[11572.26s -> 11588.57s]  that's fine potion where's it going this way oh how could i forget this one
[11592.31s -> 11599.18s]  okay goodbye thank you for coming i hope you got the clip you were looking for get out of here
[11611.35s -> 11615.94s]  oh fire fire oh i can spray that with water
[11616.82s -> 11623.40s]  i don't have any water fuck all right i'm going back to the ranch and i'm gonna do a bunch of
[11623.40s -> 11626.76s]  research i'm gonna i have to play the video game let's go go go go go go go go go go go
[11627.56s -> 11636.12s]  i don't know how i got here i don't even remember i opened up one of these a door over here right

[12296.30s -> 12298.30s]  I don't have any room on this plot
[12298.58s -> 12312.99s]  Should I just delete this and put an incinerator here? I think I'm gonna do that. I think so. It's time
[12313.51s -> 12315.48s]  guys wait
[12315.48s -> 12319.52s]  Let me clear this out first to make sure nothing in here suck all this up
[12319.96s -> 12331.30s]  I'm gonna deposit this into the inventory. I'm gonna put the hens somewhere. Oh my god. I need a
[12331.98s -> 12362.96s]  Get in there. Can I put these hens in here? Okay, cool. All right, what are the docks?
[12363.36s -> 12375.96s]  It's a far run though. Hey
[12383.05s -> 12391.29s]  You guys are just getting out stop getting out. Oh my god
[12393.89s -> 12395.93s]  Jewels I can't get this
[12396.73s -> 12403.13s]  It's too many. It's too many. It's too many. I have to I have to get I don't know to do this
[12403.13s -> 12405.13s]  It's money is everywhere
[12405.61s -> 12411.62s]  Too many quantum escape artists. I don't know. Okay, I have 50 quantum ports
[12413.14s -> 12415.14s]  Sell them I'm gonna sell everything
[12415.70s -> 12422.66s]  Get drones. I need the honey to get hold on make a teleporter to the dock. I will after I'm let me just do this
[12423.34s -> 12441.10s]  Make it to square one. I need an apiary. Okay
[12453.10s -> 12464.97s]  Get rid of the boom cats. Yeah boom cats are gonna go away and I can replace it with dervishes
[12465.53s -> 12470.86s]  Yes, good idea. I hope somebody likes vegetables
[12471.02s -> 12512.53s]  I
[12512.53s -> 12532.06s]  Broke his neck. How are you coming back? Here's my plan. Here's my plan
[12535.26s -> 12543.67s]  Okay, good. We are gonna see we're gonna be very very careful here. What do the fire slime?
[12555.78s -> 12577.58s]  Dead okay, I'm gonna make this an incinerator and we're gonna keep this and put fire slimes in here to see what happens
[12577.66s -> 12590.22s]  Good plan. I like that plan. Goodbye incinerator
[12591.22s -> 12600.91s]  An ash troll allows you to collect the ash of incinerated food at its base, which is eaten exclusive. I blow
[12607.20s -> 12610.72s]  Accidentally just created exactly what we needed and
[12611.56s -> 12615.80s]  Got an email from Casey. Hi Casey. What can I do for you? Hold on?
[12615.80s -> 12620.16s]  I'll reach your email in one second. Apparently just murdering some cat slimes
[12621.12s -> 12666.20s]  I ain't saying all right these guys you better not fucking kill me get away from me. This is so dangerous
[12666.20s -> 12671.76s]  Oh my god. Oh
[12676.13s -> 12691.72s]  My god, you little dicks. I swear to god
[12691.72s -> 12713.30s]  I'm so glad to get rid of these things feed them feed them to incinerate them
[12713.30s -> 12740.98s]  That doesn't make any sense ahead. All right, we have successfully eliminated the least by least favorite person in the game. Here we go
[12740.98s -> 12745.90s]  What does it normal food? I've got anything in there
[12746.46s -> 12762.17s]  Lean that out. Oh, these went up in value. Oh shit. Nice. Okay fire slimes going in here
[12762.53s -> 12773.22s]  So fire slimes eat. Let's take a look at the slime a pedia. They eat ash
[12773.90s -> 12777.23s]  They live on ash
[12777.47s -> 12780.55s]  Delete just about any food, but not without it being burnt to ash first
[12781.19s -> 12783.59s]  Use an incinerator with an ash throw
[12784.31s -> 12792.39s]  Upgrade our slimes need ash to survive and will quickly snuff out if left on any other surface for too long
[12792.71s -> 12801.38s]  When keeping fire slimes and an ash throw simply burn any food item to put wait they go into the fire thing
[12801.78s -> 12815.80s]  They go in here
[12815.80s -> 12831.15s]  Well, I just placed them. That's like that's annoying
[12831.79s -> 12843.81s]  Okay, I need to burn food. How many can be in here three or four. I need ash. Okay
[12847.92s -> 12868.76s]  They're working already full how can I tell one escape
[12869.12s -> 12879.24s]  Um
[12879.24s -> 12886.49s]  Upgraded it's already upgraded. Okay. Can I have four in here?
[12886.49s -> 12899.62s]  And what can I have as many as I want in here or is the limit as many as you want?
[12899.90s -> 12903.42s]  All right. How do I collect this?
[12903.66s -> 12909.24s]  Fire ploy nice. Oh, this is gonna be swell
[12909.92s -> 12916.13s]  Make sure you feed them. Is there like an ash meter? Oh
[12933.92s -> 12938.05s]  We're in any food item to produce some ash and fill the tro. Oh
[12943.70s -> 12945.70s]  I see. Okay, I get it
[12946.18s -> 12951.28s]  It's just it's just a sand. Okay, I get it. I get it. I get it cool
[12951.76s -> 12963.56s]  How much of these worth very nice? All right, so then what I can put Dervish slimes in here
[12964.00s -> 12985.33s]  Will they be mad about that? Okay, so should I can I feed a fire plort to a Dervish plort?
[12985.85s -> 12997.52s]  Cool. No fire plorts just worth just money
[12998.12s -> 13000.12s]  Okay, cool. So these guys what are these guys like?
[13000.56s -> 13008.64s]  Oracle pair is their favorite a Dervish lime is a swirling whirling bundle of energy in a slimy form
[13009.12s -> 13013.89s]  Dervish slimes are commonly found in the glass desert cruising across the dusty dunes at high speed atop little whirlwinds
[13014.29s -> 13018.33s]  One thing's for certain wherever the Dervish slime needs to go. It needs to get the tickets or it goes quickly
[13019.25s -> 13023.57s]  Dervish slimes can cause total chaos on a ranch if not cared for properly
[13023.73s -> 13029.20s]  in addition to frequently riding atop whirlwinds at high speed and collecting objects along the way a
[13030.12s -> 13036.92s]  Highly agitated Dervish slime can produce giant cyclones of air and vacuum up and toss about anything they touch
[13037.96s -> 13042.22s]  Cyclones are roaring across your ranch. There's little you can do other than brace for the chaos. Oh god
[13046.08s -> 13053.32s]  Okay, but keep them happy. They love prickle pairs. I know what I'm doing
[13058.72s -> 13070.86s]  They eat well, we'll just keep them happy for a second here. Oh
[13080.81s -> 13082.05s]  Plarts
[13082.05s -> 13095.47s]  How's this Ash doing? Pretty good. Pretty good. Okay, suck it up
[13101.96s -> 13103.44s]  Dervish plort
[13103.48s -> 13114.86s]  I'm assuming Dervish and quantum is what to do. Is there a way I can reliably get these out without sucking these guys up
[13115.42s -> 13128.83s]  All right, we're changing this move the crops
[13129.47s -> 13133.40s]  We what do I want in here a prickled a prickled pear
[13133.96s -> 13152.33s]  Where is it a prickle Rick?
[13158.24s -> 13160.24s]  Here you go your favorite food
[13160.56s -> 13170.80s]  All right. So now
[13171.04s -> 13176.63s]  It'll be okay for a little while. We'll get that shit to grow. They got food. How are you guys doing?
[13176.63s -> 13178.63s]  I'm gonna refill this throw
[13183.30s -> 13186.18s]  A lot of you guys I need a bumblebee thing to refill this
[13186.90s -> 13190.53s]  It's got to be a better way to do that
[13190.53s -> 13198.56s]  All right
[13198.56s -> 13199.68s]  Oh
[13199.68s -> 13205.41s]  Okay
[13205.41s -> 13207.57s]  Don't do it for you. He's doing this on purpose
[13208.55s -> 13210.55s]  Roth throw whatever
[13211.46s -> 13212.74s]  frog
[13212.74s -> 13219.73s]  I despise you
[13219.73s -> 13225.72s]  I think that's kind of harsh man. Are you though? Really? I'm sorry. Why?
[13227.01s -> 13229.01s]  All right, i'm gonna do
[13231.36s -> 13233.36s]  I want to combine something here
[13233.68s -> 13240.84s]  Look at all those floors. Hell, yeah
[13246.44s -> 13249.88s]  They don't have any food in here and they want prickly pears
[13251.68s -> 13252.72s]  All right
[13252.72s -> 13259.01s]  I'll give you ten dollars to pour you maple syrup down your pants pockets
[13259.81s -> 13263.44s]  These pants bought I think these pants were more than ten dollars. So it'd have to be way more than that
[13264.24s -> 13273.12s]  But I would just ruin these pants
[13273.12s -> 13275.12s]  All right. These guys are
[13275.76s -> 13283.03s]  I'm a toy. All right. What are they? Uh, what are they like? What kind of toys do they like a buzzy b?
[13283.59s -> 13286.47s]  honey slimes rubber ducky

[13348.00s -> 13352.07s]  um, I want to
[13352.07s -> 13354.07s]  Stay there
[13355.20s -> 13357.28s]  I wish I had five more inventory slots
[13358.16s -> 13359.20s]  inventory
[13359.20s -> 13360.96s]  I didn't do that on purpose
[13360.96s -> 13374.60s]  Keep this shit over here for a minute
[13381.59s -> 13385.56s]  Build we're good. These guys eat fruits. Well
[13386.52s -> 13388.12s]  Just have these for now

[13413.08s -> 13416.28s]  I should have told you then what I never did. I should have said it a hundred times
[13416.36s -> 13418.36s]  I think about all the time that if we had been best
[13418.84s -> 13422.92s]  Honest about it. We how might still be running on that garden shop and i'll be writing music in the basement
[13423.48s -> 13454.72s]  You guys eat a lot
[13454.72s -> 13462.44s]  You guys eat too much. All right, we're gonna thin this out a little
[13466.60s -> 13468.60s]  We don't need that many. Okay, I took out four
[13469.16s -> 13472.61s]  let's have
[13472.61s -> 13475.52s]  We'll do
[13475.52s -> 13477.84s]  One two, three, four five six six is okay
[13478.48s -> 13483.43s]  What do we do with the other ones?
[13483.43s -> 13484.95s]  Just destroy
[13484.95s -> 13488.66s]  Put them in the water
[13488.66s -> 13492.76s]  These guys have food
[13492.76s -> 13497.52s]  Put them in storage. You can't store a fire slime
[13510.74s -> 13513.75s]  All right, that's good
[13513.75s -> 13515.75s]  He's ready. They are ready
[13516.87s -> 13518.15s]  Very cool
[13518.15s -> 13526.08s]  Now we'll get double
[13526.08s -> 13529.30s]  eventually
[13529.30s -> 13532.90s]  I have a lot of points. I'm gonna I think i'm gonna store these or something. How much are they?
[13533.14s -> 13535.14s]  Money is i'm not really spending money anymore
[13537.73s -> 13540.37s]  Money sink, I think until i'm done playing this game is this

[13720.76s -> 13731.25s]  Look, uh
[13731.25s -> 13734.45s]  The next thing i'm going to do is get a bunch of drones
[13735.09s -> 13738.61s]  To have them do all this work. That's next that's coming up now
[13739.41s -> 13741.59s]  So let's do some selling
[13741.59s -> 13746.63s]  How much is this worth fire ploys are worth 51. That's it. Dervish is worth 74
[13747.59s -> 13756.80s]  I need quantum ploys. Don't I save them?
[13763.01s -> 13765.01s]  The pairs are going over here
[13772.47s -> 13783.06s]  These guys love this shit what about the quests
[13783.62s -> 13786.95s]  The quests haven't really been that good
[13787.51s -> 13793.08s]  They've been kind of lame
[13793.08s -> 13800.12s]  But I you want for for a fucking two turkeys four strawberries and 250 bucks. This is worthless
[13804.48s -> 13809.04s]  All right. I'm gonna go deposit this stuff and take a look at what I need to figure out how to do these drones
[13809.12s -> 13810.64s]  I need honey
[13810.64s -> 13812.16s]  I have to build
[13812.16s -> 13813.04s]  some

[13855.54s -> 13858.26s]  I have one of them already. I need pink plorts
[13866.05s -> 13868.05s]  Let's go get pink
[13868.82s -> 13872.24s]  tons of pink plorts
[13872.24s -> 13874.24s]  moss blanket apiary
[13874.24s -> 13875.44s]  That's the one
[13875.44s -> 13893.54s]  Okay. Hi guys
[13894.32s -> 13896.32s]  Who's hungry?
[13905.01s -> 13915.11s]  Pink see you needed these. That's right. You're that's true
[13916.23s -> 13918.40s]  That's absolutely accurate. I did need them
[13919.04s -> 13932.74s]  You're right
[13932.74s -> 13936.98s]  These lemons look so good. I really just want don't you want just squeeze one of these in your mouth
[13939.40s -> 13948.87s]  How do you feel like these are really cold ice cold lemon juice extra sour that sounds awesome right now
[13950.31s -> 13964.05s]  Okay apiary
[13964.61s -> 13967.41s]  One two three, how many can I have at once three, right?
[13969.03s -> 13976.12s]  And put this in the moss level, which is the moss one this one up here
[13976.84s -> 13985.43s]  I can have six
[13985.51s -> 13991.46s]  Eight I can have eight. I know that's six, isn't it? No, it's six
[13993.68s -> 13997.52s]  The genre of germa joke where he over describes food good stuff. What?
[14000.13s -> 14002.21s]  I I want that I want to eat that right now
[14003.81s -> 14005.81s]  Over describing food
[14006.29s -> 14008.29s]  Wait, I didn't put those fire plorts in here
[14030.71s -> 14032.31s]  Well, I did it already
[14032.31s -> 14047.17s]  They added so much to this game. So am I just right now enjoying
[14048.05s -> 14051.41s]  A fully just complete how much of this stuff wasn't here?
[14052.21s -> 14061.64s]  Three four years ago tons of it really most of this
[14064.23s -> 14069.99s]  Holy shit. Okay. Cool. Uh, let me see. I need pink again. I'm gonna eventually need it. Ah, whatever
[14072.07s -> 14075.99s]  Uh here just eat this i'm gonna need pink again later
[14079.70s -> 14082.10s]  Everything before the temple. It seems like a lot
[14089.22s -> 14091.94s]  Uh, you i'll throw this into the fire
[14092.58s -> 14097.88s]  You guys got food?
[14097.88s -> 14111.36s]  You do? Okay. Good
[14111.36s -> 14113.44s]  Uh, I don't I just don't I don't even want this
[14114.08s -> 14117.35s]  Okay now
[14117.35s -> 14119.97s]  I just lost everything. I was just doing what am I doing?
[14120.61s -> 14124.39s]  I just lost everything forget everything. What was I doing?
[14125.03s -> 14130.69s]  I was about to go and oh it put apiary, right?
[14142.10s -> 14144.10s]  I still have the gold
[14149.49s -> 14151.49s]  Up here. We need to we're gonna teleport
[14152.85s -> 14155.17s]  I think I know what i'm doing
[14155.81s -> 14173.70s]  I think I know what i'm doing. I think it's eating right? Yeah
[14174.82s -> 14191.89s]  Okay through this teleporter
[14192.21s -> 14199.64s]  And they're gonna put apiaries everywhere how much of your blood is heal at any moment?
[14201.01s -> 14204.21s]  Um, I don't know it depends. Okay. Let's say I had a heal in the morning
[14206.72s -> 14207.68s]  that's
[14207.68s -> 14208.80s]  What?
[14208.80s -> 14210.80s]  16 ounces of heal
[14212.39s -> 14217.11s]  Which how does that get into my bloodstream does it goes in my stomach from my esophagus into my stomach
[14217.75s -> 14221.41s]  and then down into my intestines and everything and absorbed
[14222.52s -> 14225.30s]  so
[14225.30s -> 14228.74s]  I don't know over the course of the day. I don't know what I would be like maybe like
[14230.37s -> 14240.04s]  1.2 1.4 percent heal at any given moment. All right, we're gonna put them all here
[14243.22s -> 14254.93s]  Apiary you
[14255.17s -> 14267.03s]  Okay, then up here. Oh, i'm sorry that hurt you
[14267.59s -> 14281.81s]  All right. So that's one two, three, four five six
[14283.96s -> 14286.26s]  12 minutes
[14286.26s -> 14288.60s]  Until I can come collect
[14288.60s -> 14311.04s]  In the meantime, we're gonna go sell a bunch of stuff. What do you think of fuel? Is it yummy genuinely curious?
[14312.29s -> 14314.69s]  Uh, I can give you my review of all three flavors
[14315.72s -> 14318.20s]  Uh chocolate is the best tasting out of the three
[14319.80s -> 14323.56s]  But unfortunately it is also the thickest of the three
[14324.90s -> 14326.02s]  so
[14326.02s -> 14330.58s]  If you want to sip on something for a long time, it's kind of like a it's it has the consistency of a milkshake
[14330.66s -> 14332.18s]  It's pretty thick
[14332.18s -> 14333.86s]  Tastes the best though
[14333.86s -> 14335.06s]  vanilla
[14335.06s -> 14339.38s]  Is it a decent flavor? It's probably I'd say it's second. Maybe it's a tie between berry and vanilla
[14339.78s -> 14344.16s]  The only the problem that I have with vanilla is it has kind of a weird
[14344.94s -> 14346.69s]  consistency
[14346.69s -> 14349.97s]  It tends to have sort of a weird after texture in my mouth
[14351.17s -> 14355.16s]  It tastes great, but not my favorite now berry on the other hand
[14355.89s -> 14359.73s]  Berry on the other hand is a best of both worlds. It's thin enough to drink
[14361.56s -> 14364.60s]  So it's really easy to drink. It's thin. It's not super
[14365.32s -> 14367.57s]  Thick and heavy and it also tastes good
[14367.57s -> 14373.52s]  It tastes like a strawberry milkshake like almost like a berry gogurt or something. I'd say that's probably my favorite one
[14374.00s -> 14377.08s]  nobody asked
[14378.04s -> 14383.48s]  Yes, they did dead
[14384.52s -> 14386.52s]  A voice crack
[14386.76s -> 14388.53s]  Clip it
[14388.53s -> 14390.53s]  And put it under my bed
[14391.04s -> 14393.92s]  And the voice crack very will show up and give me five dollars
[14396.79s -> 14399.11s]  Okay time to sell a bunch of shit
[14413.30s -> 14416.80s]  I got 12 minutes. Tell me yell at me when 12 minutes has gone by
[14430.68s -> 14432.12s]  Oh
[14432.12s -> 14435.16s]  My god, what's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong? Get that out of here?
[14436.12s -> 14438.12s]  Get that out of here. Go the other way
[14438.52s -> 14440.52s]  Go the other direction
[14448.26s -> 14450.26s]  Who's doing that in there what the fuck is wrong with you
[14452.05s -> 14454.21s]  What's wrong with you in here?
[14454.21s -> 14457.96s]  Stop this shit
[14457.96s -> 14461.06s]  Why are they doing this?
[14461.06s -> 14464.34s]  They're hungry. The feeder is the feeder should be going
[14475.80s -> 14480.44s]  They're gonna kill everybody. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait settle down settle down settle down everybody quiet

[14489.88s -> 14491.88s]  Relax settle down
[14493.24s -> 14495.24s]  Don't do anything eat food
[14495.80s -> 14505.68s]  I make the all right. I have to the feeder is going faster, but
[14507.36s -> 14510.24s]  I have to uh, I gotta throw some other fruits in here

[14535.73s -> 14539.64s]  Why can't there be a gentle shoot?
[14539.72s -> 14542.28s]  That seems like why?
[14542.36s -> 14560.69s]  I'm gonna sneeze again and I have to mute. I'm sorry. I just sneezed like three times in a row
[14560.69s -> 14562.69s]  It was twice. I lied about it. I sneezed twice

[14744.64s -> 14746.64s]  And then we're gonna be on our merry way
[14757.59s -> 14759.75s]  Now these guys will be happy for quite a long time
[14764.72s -> 14777.67s]  This six in here. I think that one died. Whatever. What about the slimes in the grotto?
[14779.35s -> 14781.35s]  Oh, it's probably a mess in there

[15316.13s -> 15318.13s]  another full stack of
[15318.61s -> 15320.61s]  rads
[15321.83s -> 15326.36s]  Buy toys for the grotto
[15326.36s -> 15329.40s]  Can you hold multiple stacks? I don't think you can you cannot
[15331.06s -> 15338.32s]  Do not believe you can
[15338.32s -> 15340.82s]  Do you guys have anything in here?
[15340.98s -> 15343.36s]  Too many
[15343.36s -> 15345.99s]  Okay
[15345.99s -> 15358.60s]  What's your problem?

[15389.96s -> 15394.48s]  All right, i'm gonna sell these
[15407.22s -> 15413.36s]  Okay, well hold on how fair is that that means all referential humor is family guy I can't reference anything
[15414.00s -> 15421.19s]  Is that what they've cornered the market on anytime you can reference anything referential humor is not allowed because it's family guy
[15422.07s -> 15423.99s]  What would you prefer I do?
[15423.99s -> 15428.04s]  Those are the rules

[15468.72s -> 15470.56s]  I think that's um

[15486.44s -> 15491.30s]  It's very funny unless you do it
[15505.24s -> 15506.61s]  Oh

[15544.55s -> 15551.30s]  Who the hell is that thing?
[15551.30s -> 15568.66s]  I've been streaming for four hours and 20 minutes. Oh nice
[15570.48s -> 15574.00s]  Hey, you guys remember that time when I streamed for four hours and 20 minutes
[15574.72s -> 15576.32s]  on 420

[15579.16s -> 15583.97s]  Hey, you guys remember the time
[15583.97s -> 15588.04s]  No
[15588.04s -> 15593.00s]  I think you guys say I have family guy jokes because I talk like peter griffin because I have a boston accent and he's got
[15593.00s -> 15596.52s]  A boston accent too. So whenever we do like I whenever I do like a weird voice
[15596.60s -> 15598.68s]  It's just peter griffin because I we're from the same place

[15735.49s -> 15738.05s]  That's not listen to me talking. I don't talk like that on a regular basis
[15738.05s -> 15740.69s]  I do it like to do like the hey, i'm from boston joke guy
[15742.85s -> 15748.05s]  Even though I talk like that sometimes I talk it was right there cockies. Yeah cockies. Where are my car keys?
[15748.05s -> 15750.05s]  I don't know where your car keys. I don't care
[15750.21s -> 15757.14s]  I don't know
[15757.14s -> 15759.14s]  Say dollars dollars
[15759.36s -> 15766.85s]  dollars dollars
[15766.95s -> 15771.03s]  Say room. Yeah, go to go to you go to your room. Take clean up your room room room
[15773.92s -> 15775.92s]  He's a family guy streamer
[15777.17s -> 15781.33s]  I gotta go to my room and clean up on my car. He's not a family guy. He says family guy things
[15781.41s -> 15788.34s]  He's a family guy
[15788.34s -> 15797.16s]  He's so bad
[15797.16s -> 15799.64s]  All right. I can make a drone. Can I make more than one?
[15800.60s -> 15802.84s]  I just made one. What do I do with it?
[15803.16s -> 15819.46s]  Where is it? I have two drones
[15821.25s -> 15823.97s]  t oh
[15823.97s -> 15826.76s]  Okay. Um
[15826.76s -> 15828.60s]  What should I do with them?
[15828.60s -> 15841.78s]  Place it down. It's a gadget. Okay
[15842.18s -> 15845.64s]  Read the manual. Yeah, let me see if I can
[15846.12s -> 15852.68s]  All right, so if I
[15852.68s -> 15859.84s]  Drone a help learn more drones are a highly useful gadget that can reduce
[15860.40s -> 15863.92s]  Some of the work a rancher needs to perform on the ranch to keep things running smoothly
[15864.64s -> 15867.84s]  Once you build a drone simply give it a program using three simple inputs
[15868.56s -> 15871.52s]  target what the drone is looking for on your ranch
[15872.32s -> 15873.52s]  source
[15873.52s -> 15875.52s]  Where the drone gets its target?
[15875.68s -> 15877.92s]  Destination where the drone targets it takes its target
[15878.56s -> 15883.92s]  If you give a drone an impossible task or a drone simply cannot complete their task presently it'll go idle
[15884.48s -> 15888.82s]  A drone can run for about a day before it will return to its station. It must be powered again up again
[15889.38s -> 15891.86s]  Simply give it a refreshing blast of water to recharge it
[15892.34s -> 15896.74s]  The drone only works on your ranch and will only work within the ranch expansion in which you place it
[15897.62s -> 15900.98s]  Sometimes the drone will overflow an auto feeder
[15901.54s -> 15906.50s]  Or silo due to the bug in their software the 7c corporation insists. This bug is a feature
[15906.98s -> 15918.42s]  Am I fucking making you angry by talking like a guy from new england? This is all an act guys
[15918.82s -> 15922.32s]  This is that's how I normally talk. I'm I it takes me it's difficult to do this
[15922.88s -> 15931.35s]  I'm trying very hard not to talk like that as you can tell that's my real voice
[15940.55s -> 15943.83s]  Okay target what the drone is looking for on your now. I'm like gonna start doing it
[15944.39s -> 15949.56s]  What the drone where the drone gets its target where the drone takes its target?
[15949.56s -> 15954.48s]  So I want to take so target what the drone is looking for on the ranch
[15955.12s -> 15957.78s]  So if I put him down
[15957.78s -> 15962.00s]  Install let me see what this does
[15962.72s -> 15963.68s]  so
[15963.68s -> 15965.68s]  activate target is gonna be
[15968.13s -> 15975.01s]  This is so cool. The target is gonna be
[15976.84s -> 15979.06s]  um
[15979.06s -> 15985.46s]  fruit the source will be from a garden and the destination is going to be
[15986.76s -> 15995.46s]  Auto feeders, but no what?
[15998.92s -> 16000.92s]  I don't want to just kind of go around and fly around do this
[16001.56s -> 16006.07s]  Get the fruit from the gardens, right?
[16006.07s -> 16009.09s]  Pick a specific fruit
[16009.09s -> 16011.80s]  Can I?
[16011.80s -> 16014.20s]  Okay, specific fruit. So you want to get
[16015.94s -> 16018.00s]  Prickle pear
[16018.00s -> 16022.32s]  From a garden and put it into an auto feeder, but can I say specifically?
[16022.96s -> 16033.83s]  Can I say specific? I can't put this one. Does that matter? It'd be all fruit
[16035.84s -> 16037.36s]  Do all fruit
[16037.36s -> 16039.36s]  From a garden. That's what I did before everyone screamed at me
[16045.14s -> 16055.97s]  Let's see what he does
[16055.97s -> 16064.47s]  Wake up. Okay. Now I want to put uh veggies into the incinerator
[16076.28s -> 16078.96s]  target veggies
[16079.20s -> 16080.55s]  source
[16080.55s -> 16081.99s]  gardens
[16081.99s -> 16083.99s]  destination in the incinerator
[16084.39s -> 16085.35s]  activate
[16085.35s -> 16093.57s]  I need water. There's no fruit to collect
[16094.37s -> 16099.28s]  Yeah, there is this the prickly pear. I gotta get water. Hold on
[16100.85s -> 16112.52s]  Um, where's the fountain thing? It's like here somewhere, right? What's the water spout?
[16113.16s -> 16116.26s]  Do I not have one here?
[16116.26s -> 16118.90s]  I'm just gonna go to the pond

[16135.86s -> 16147.25s]  Okay splash
[16147.73s -> 16161.41s]  But the fruit needs to be there for okay. Oh, there he goes. Look they he's gonna put this in the incinerator

[16700.08s -> 16704.31s]  Does it have to be one or the other? Why can't we do multiple things on a stream?
[16704.87s -> 16707.49s]  You putting up with them kicking down
[16715.64s -> 16718.45s]  Don't spoil I'm not spoiling anything

[16737.81s -> 16739.33s]  Um
[16739.33s -> 16741.96s]  Mmm, I would say more on the lines

[16889.86s -> 16901.32s]  I don't think I'm not gonna stream blizzcon. I think don't you have to pay to watch blizzcon?
[16901.96s -> 16909.41s]  Isn't it like?
[16909.41s -> 16911.57s]  $500 it's free this year. Hmm

[16945.86s -> 16959.12s]  Have a drone collect the fire ploys. That's actually a really good idea. All right advanced apiary. There it is six
[16960.93s -> 16961.89s]  now
[16961.89s -> 16964.69s]  Do I want more drones or do I want to try to get that royal jelly?
[16965.25s -> 16967.81s]  Should I start with just to get a shit load of drones have him do everything for me?
[16973.12s -> 16980.74s]  Yeah, that's a good idea. What are we doing in here collection?

[17005.96s -> 17010.04s]  They eat vegetables. They don't like that food. I want to make some I want to make some crystal
[17012.45s -> 17015.65s]  Wind crystal wind I think that'd be kind of cool
[17017.03s -> 17028.84s]  I'm making crystal winds
[17028.84s -> 17030.84s]  Yeah, we're going for it crystal winds
[17033.41s -> 17035.97s]  I'm doing it
[17035.97s -> 17037.97s]  Save it for the mosaics line. Oh

[17300.80s -> 17306.04s]  I really don't I don't need quantum anymore
[17306.68s -> 17330.10s]  I'm just gonna store like one quantum plort and then these guys can just go free they get out too easily
[17337.89s -> 17341.73s]  Save one quantum plort in the event that I want to make a quantum
[17354.63s -> 17356.63s]  Of lemons, I need more pinks eventually
[17357.35s -> 17372.07s]  Get it
[17372.07s -> 17378.12s]  email

[17397.46s -> 17398.50s]  Hey b
[17398.50s -> 17401.40s]  There's another tour coming up and I have a feeling that this will be the one
[17401.80s -> 17403.64s]  Here I am packing my bags and thinking to you
[17403.64s -> 17406.52s]  Maybe this is how it felt when you were leaving for your big adventure lots of excitement
[17406.92s -> 17409.91s]  I keep thinking that maybe i'll catch you somewhere out there in the crowd
[17410.39s -> 17414.72s]  Whatever happens. I promise i'll sing a song for you. All right casey. Thank you
[17415.68s -> 17420.07s]  Wait, what he just took a moment to reflect
[17420.39s -> 17425.01s]  He thought about hobson and thora and the adventures he'd had exploring the far far range
[17426.10s -> 17429.70s]  Most of all, she thought of casey and wondered where life would take her next like at the end
[17429.94s -> 17431.94s]  Am I getting like enrage timered?
[17438.29s -> 17440.29s]  I just hit the enrage timer in the game
[17448.45s -> 17457.16s]  what
[17458.13s -> 17459.65s]  I took too long
[17459.65s -> 17461.65s]  I took too long. Are you serious?
[17465.54s -> 17468.74s]  I'm like i'm gonna go get these slimes over here. I'm gonna go do this one. I'm gonna do that one
[17469.78s -> 17472.58s]  No, i'm done. I hit the games and rage timer
[17474.66s -> 17476.74s]  No, it's then. Yeah, it's it. No, that's fine
[17477.86s -> 17479.86s]  It takes like in 40 days or whatever
[17480.50s -> 17481.94s]  You do this
[17481.94s -> 17485.94s]  And the game kind of ends and you can keep playing. I yeah, that's definitely what it is
[17487.30s -> 17489.35s]  Hey chris lum
[17489.35s -> 17492.31s]  What a god of a game designer. I love this game. It was fantastic
[17494.82s -> 17496.82s]  Hey, hey game development studios
[17497.06s -> 17498.42s]  just
[17498.42s -> 17502.50s]  Give that person a hundred million fucking dollars for the next game do it
[17503.54s -> 17505.54s]  Again, I want investors on there
[17518.15s -> 17521.99s]  Whatever okay, whatever budget you were gonna put into the next call of duty give it to this guy
[17523.35s -> 17525.43s]  I'd give it a hundred million dollars
[17533.00s -> 17537.64s]  Don't limit creativity with contracts. Let them do what they want. Oh, they would be no strings attached
[17537.80s -> 17540.84s]  If I had a hundred if I had a billion dollars right now
[17543.32s -> 17547.72s]  I would be writing checks left and right like I don't even fucking care if you pay me back just make something cool
[17549.54s -> 17552.50s]  And then I would pace around my living room for four years until it came out
[17569.67s -> 17580.42s]  Isn't that what death stranding was I have no idea, I don't know cool. All right. Well
[17580.98s -> 17583.99s]  I'm just kind of in the middle of something
[17585.97s -> 17593.88s]  Wait, do the credits take more than 12 minutes because my apiaries are probably done be brave pile of shit
[17594.28s -> 17613.01s]  Oh cool. All right, let's sleep
[17613.01s -> 17615.40s]  Hello there. Thanks taking you to the old ranch
[17616.04s -> 17619.19s]  I've acted wait a minute. It's a little thank you
[17619.19s -> 17623.03s]  I've activated three secret vaults that I built years ago to stash a small fortune
[17626.53s -> 17629.17s]  You know me. I like a good adventure. I'm not telling you where the vaults are located
[17632.96s -> 17636.64s]  slime key
[17636.64s -> 17640.64s]  Single spare slime key just in case you can't seem to find the last one
[17641.36s -> 17643.30s]  Okay, what?
[17643.30s -> 17651.41s]  How many you'll never find it? No, probably not
[17652.05s -> 17655.06s]  all right, let me uh
[17655.06s -> 17658.08s]  Let me store this and then we'll keep we'll do the thing. I want to go um
[17658.96s -> 17686.18s]  I'm gonna go back to that crystal world. I have water the teleport to the crystal world and then i'm just going and with empty
[17686.90s -> 17695.30s]  The lead dev musician and artist of this game made spiral nights a free mmo on steam
[17695.30s -> 17697.62s]  It's very fun. It's the exact same atmosphere. Please try it
[17698.60s -> 17702.60s]  You usually get to the boss in two to three streams spin up there over time. Oh, well, okay, cool
[17703.40s -> 17714.63s]  Why have I heard that name before?
[17714.63s -> 17716.60s]  All right, we're going
[17716.60s -> 17719.64s]  Where's the teleporter to get here? I feel like this is ridiculous
[17720.44s -> 17721.96s]  Where's the port here?
[17721.96s -> 17723.56s]  I'm way too far away
[17723.56s -> 17739.20s]  I don't want to walk all the way over here. This is that's just a one way to I have to walk here
[17739.84s -> 17744.02s]  I have to build one. Oh shit. I'm definitely not doing that
[17745.14s -> 17747.78s]  That's not happening on this stream. I guarantee it. I'm telling you for real
[17749.88s -> 17751.88s]  Uh here listen
[17753.25s -> 17755.25s]  Uh, we're gonna get to this part here
[17755.33s -> 17760.72s]  I'm gonna clean up a little bit. I'm gonna make the slimes. I want to make I want to make a mosaic crystal
[17761.12s -> 17763.12s]  And I want to make a mosaic wind
[17763.76s -> 17768.96s]  And then i'm gonna make some money i'm gonna buy i'm gonna open this this game is
[17769.44s -> 17792.34s]  Uh, no, i'm not gonna make that joke because I love it. Just move to boston the beer here sucks
[17801.06s -> 17804.42s]  Well, sorry to hear that try the cider it's it's way better
[17809.59s -> 17811.59s]  That doesn't make me mad or anything though
[17811.75s -> 17815.91s]  I don't have some attachment to
[17817.01s -> 17822.26s]  boston beer
[17822.26s -> 17826.02s]  What'd that guy say what the fuck that dude just say you don't like boston beer
[17826.66s -> 17843.19s]  What kind of fucking beer you drink? Oh, I don't care. Yes
[17850.68s -> 17852.68s]  It's lime fossil three of them
[17853.40s -> 17855.67s]  Hope I have enough room
[17855.67s -> 17861.36s]  Carry what I want to carry
[17861.36s -> 17864.82s]  That suck
[17864.82s -> 17870.90s]  Yeah, and tom brady won the super bowl on another team. I know i've and gronkowski's on that team and shit
[17870.98s -> 17872.98s]  I know I get it. It's like
[17873.30s -> 17874.74s]  I don't care though
[17874.74s -> 17882.42s]  I mean, I cared I cared when
[17884.48s -> 17886.48s]  when tom brady left the patriots it was like
[17887.67s -> 17898.00s]  Oh tom is this new kid coming up this new kid coming i'll get a fucking cannon for now
[17898.72s -> 17915.17s]  What do you even need tom anymore?
[17915.17s -> 17917.57s]  No, what we're doing we're gonna build up our farm system. We're gonna do
[17919.04s -> 17921.12s]  Take a couple years sub 500. It's fine. It's okay
[17922.00s -> 17924.00s]  Our farm system is gonna come up
[17928.55s -> 17931.67s]  All about farm system the farm system our farm system
[17936.61s -> 17941.33s]  And I mean that person has not watched a single minor league game at all or a college game
[17941.89s -> 17946.18s]  Our minor league system is our farm our farm system is great. I love our farm
[17949.97s -> 17951.97s]  We got we got tomatoes
[17952.05s -> 17959.06s]  Uh chili peppers
[17959.06s -> 17962.18s]  Yeah, hopefully hopefully Pedro martinez can pee into the ground
[17968.40s -> 17972.29s]  He was the best
[17972.29s -> 17985.19s]  All right that way
[17985.19s -> 17987.19s]  gronk ball
[17989.86s -> 17995.70s]  Didn't gronk used to spike balls into the ground and they would explode or am I making him up and making him a superhero?
[17996.26s -> 18001.51s]  I don't why I have this memory of gronk spiking a ball in the end zone and it exploded
[18002.15s -> 18006.37s]  Did I said that that was a dream?
[18010.45s -> 18012.93s]  That must have been right after we won in two one eight fifteen
[18013.89s -> 18016.26s]  I gotta go this way all the way around
[18018.90s -> 18024.79s]  Gronk in the rumble. No, i'm not gonna put gronkowski in the germ of rumble. Why?
[18033.22s -> 18035.22s]  That was mr. Superbowl
[18035.96s -> 18040.92s]  From blitz the league two not even a real person not even a real game
[18042.95s -> 18046.47s]  That's that's what it was. Okay. Well, you can tell how much I pay attention to football
[18048.52s -> 18051.24s]  I played that I streamed that and that was one of the things you could do
[18055.03s -> 18055.99s]  right
[18055.99s -> 18067.91s]  We're not even talking about that gronk. We're talking about the one from spore
[18069.32s -> 18070.68s]  You are
[18070.68s -> 18076.29s]  Did I go off on a football thing for no reason you guys talking about gronk from spore?
[18088.12s -> 18096.31s]  there
[18098.76s -> 18101.86s]  Tom brady
[18101.86s -> 18106.58s]  You know like here's the thing. I'm like tom brady. Wow, the new england patriots. He won so many times
[18107.06s -> 18112.42s]  What a legacy tom brady the best football team ever dynasty, right?
[18112.90s -> 18117.11s]  But part of me kind of wanted him to throw like 40 interceptions in that game
[18118.08s -> 18120.23s]  You know
[18120.23s -> 18129.14s]  He didn't like part of me wanted every single pet one of his passes to get intercepted and break every single wet record
[18129.22s -> 18130.58s]  a hundred times
[18130.58s -> 18136.68s]  It's the most unbelievable thing we've ever seen at the super bowl every single pass attempt by tom brady has been intercepted and run
[18136.68s -> 18139.08s]  Back for a touchdown
[18139.08s -> 18144.66s]  This has never happened before ever in the history of all sports. I'd be like, oh, that's fucking kind of funny
[18145.62s -> 18154.13s]  The other team is up by I don't even know what the other team it was there's the buccaneers and somebody else the
[18157.06s -> 18160.39s]  Kings, I don't know why the kings the kings
[18162.58s -> 18166.95s]  The chiefs, okay. Why did I say kings or whatever?
[18175.00s -> 18177.88s]  Okay, anyways, they would be up by like 200 points
[18179.60s -> 18182.32s]  And they would do the thing right before they go to commercial break with tom brady
[18183.02s -> 18186.64s]  Screams fuck as loud as he can and it's very clearly. That's what he did
[18187.86s -> 18191.22s]  It's a kind of a close-up. He's sitting on the bench. He spits he spits twice
[18192.04s -> 18194.04s]  Dumps water all over his head and he goes
[18194.44s -> 18198.60s]  Fuck i've seen that so many times
[18199.16s -> 18210.55s]  He's like after like the 25th interception in a row. What would he what would he do?
[18211.19s -> 18222.20s]  Okay, I need crystal slimes. I have water. I'm gonna get back that way water the plants
[18222.76s -> 18238.52s]  That's not doing anything
[18238.52s -> 18240.52s]  It needs special water
[18242.31s -> 18244.31s]  Need holy water. Okay, that's bullshit
[18245.03s -> 18260.48s]  It's new
[18260.48s -> 18262.48s]  Oh, no, I had beats already
[18265.73s -> 18268.42s]  What the fuck is going on in here?
[18270.13s -> 18282.64s]  What do you mean what's going on here drop kick a rotisserie chicken across
[18285.60s -> 18288.00s]  Uh, no, no one does the drop kick like doug flutie
[18288.64s -> 18291.38s]  When the only guys in football will do that
[18292.02s -> 18294.02s]  He drop kicked the ball
[18294.10s -> 18295.62s]  into the end zone
[18295.62s -> 18298.50s]  Past the uprights. No one's ever done that before doug flutie is the only one
[18303.56s -> 18309.40s]  Okay, here we go. So where are those mosaic ones?
[18316.55s -> 18319.97s]  They have a face. Where are they?
[18319.97s -> 18323.28s]  Underneath, okay
[18323.28s -> 18325.44s]  There we go. All right, so spray this guy with water
[18333.92s -> 18356.48s]  Uh, that's not that didn't do anything. You need holy water, dude. I where do you
[18357.20s -> 18366.32s]  Where am I supposed to get holy water? He needs to get a mosaic plort. Where do I get a mosaic plort?
[18381.46s -> 18383.46s]  Need mosaic slimes veggies
[18385.06s -> 18389.14s]  Yeah, and i've got to put a plort in there, but i haven't seen any mosaics slimes. Are they in this area?
[18389.62s -> 18392.10s]  Have I just missed them?
[18392.10s -> 18413.46s]  They show up at night or something. Thank god. I almost fell. All right. I need to get out of here. How do I get out of here?
[18414.18s -> 18419.11s]  Eat the gordo slime
[18421.06s -> 18422.10s]  Shit
[18422.10s -> 18438.36s]  I really thought I was gonna be able to get in here. Come on. Give me a crystal
[18444.32s -> 18455.94s]  Oh a mosaic. I mean damn it beat a big slime. I didn't come here with that. I I came here with the intention of
[18456.74s -> 18462.88s]  The intention was to fill up on oh man. That was painful
[18463.68s -> 18469.89s]  I have nothing to add. It's when I have had my message highlighted. Well, that's all right, man
[18477.54s -> 18496.10s]  It's nighttime. I don't see anything. It's nighttime though fill up that first fountain with rock plorts
[18497.76s -> 18501.73s]  Hmm
[18536.39s -> 18537.67s]  Read this
[18537.67s -> 18547.27s]  I hope something gets whatever that's a really mean thing to say
[18547.99s -> 18572.36s]  Really mean thing to say to somebody eat that I what does this mean? What's my favorite color? Uh blue?
[18573.41s -> 18575.41s]  Or green or teal?
[18577.35s -> 18580.39s]  My favorite color is the green stripe of the aqua fresh toothpaste
[18581.60s -> 18583.92s]  Not a lie. I truly that's what I truly want
[18584.56s -> 18614.61s]  God damn it
[18614.61s -> 18617.33s]  No, I
[18617.33s -> 18628.04s]  I don't this is not working. That's not the first fountain. This whole place is coming down
[18629.08s -> 18631.08s]  You have to have to do the first one first
[18640.44s -> 18643.16s]  Where's the first fountain?
[18643.16s -> 18645.40s]  I don't I don't remember even passing one. Is it on here?
[18649.96s -> 18657.32s]  Same as the door puzzle. You have to shoot plorts into the mouse. Okay, he's ignoring the chat. No, no
[18657.80s -> 18661.12s]  So I have to do arrow earlier in the level. Okay
[18666.31s -> 18668.23s]  Well, i'm probably getting close to calling it
[18668.68s -> 18670.28s]  I'm getting close to calling it
[18670.28s -> 18674.63s]  I'll do this part here and then we'll probably call the stream
[18675.19s -> 18680.85s]  I've had a lot of fun. I've had a lot of fun with you today
[18685.04s -> 18690.13s]  Get out of here rock plorts in the fountain
[18693.65s -> 18704.32s]  We'll go slime lamp. What's the verdict on next slime rancher stream?
[18709.16s -> 18715.68s]  I don't think so. I think that's it the stream content of slime rancher
[18717.83s -> 18719.33s]  probably
[18719.33s -> 18723.16s]  probably going to
[18723.16s -> 18729.49s]  Oh, no, if i'm gonna play I will probably just grind and play on my own if I feel like it
[18730.69s -> 18735.81s]  Just have my mouth open
[18735.81s -> 18739.94s]  Maybe after all this time. He hates it. No, I just
[18740.74s -> 18743.06s]  I I think i'm pretty much almost at the end game
[18745.06s -> 18747.06s]  I'm going farther away
[18752.39s -> 18754.88s]  Wait, I want rocks
[18755.75s -> 18761.99s]  Can you guys give me rocks? No
[18761.99s -> 18763.91s]  You have a plort too
[18763.91s -> 18768.42s]  You're not even that close to the end game. Well, well
[18769.22s -> 18772.56s]  Maybe one day i'll get there
[18772.56s -> 18774.48s]  Uh, so what you can expect in the next
[18775.12s -> 18777.83s]  three or four days
[18777.83s -> 18780.31s]  I'm going to try to get I haven't done it yet
[18781.36s -> 18784.24s]  I have to sign up and do some stuff with the gta rp server
[18785.11s -> 18788.07s]  So i'm gonna like go through that process over the next few days
[18789.14s -> 18791.54s]  And see what happens
[18791.54s -> 18798.26s]  I am not guaranteeing that i'm gonna be playing gta rp. I don't know. I think there's like a system where you have to get
[18798.90s -> 18805.14s]  Uh broad you have to get like approved and white listed and everything I think or something or other I don't really know
[18806.45s -> 18814.10s]  Uh gta rp. Yeah, we'll see. I once I if I get in maybe we'll do a few streams of
[18815.01s -> 18830.80s]  You just fucking around an rp. That's on tap potentially besides that
[18831.36s -> 18837.01s]  There are a lot of random games that I still have to play. I still want to play
[18837.01s -> 18839.01s]  I still have a thousand year door by the way
[18840.68s -> 18850.00s]  Maybe if gta rp doesn't work out next week start thousand year door, maybe if gta rp doesn't work out in the next week
[18851.28s -> 18852.80s]  I'll play
[18852.80s -> 18865.27s]  I don't know figure it out. I got a handful of games that I have installed that I want to do
[18865.35s -> 18883.43s]  All right. I am very lost this way. There's one at the beginning of the level. I'm curious about this
[18883.43s -> 18885.27s]  Where is the one at the beginning of the level?
[18885.27s -> 18895.36s]  Rock fountain is this guy too?
[18903.52s -> 18905.28s]  Rock fountain

[19205.21s -> 19208.92s]  I didn't I didn't even know what that thing did
[19208.92s -> 19210.60s]  I've never fed that before
[19210.60s -> 19215.08s]  I fed him once and he exploded

[19260.09s -> 19261.85s]  You know, i'm
[19261.85s -> 19266.09s]  If I don't play another if I don't play a game for a week, you'll never see it again
[19267.29s -> 19269.18s]  All right
[19269.18s -> 19271.18s]  Just the way it is. That's the way it's always been
[19271.34s -> 19275.50s]  So if I get into gta rp

[19745.48s -> 19747.80s]  Pick him up. Let him in. Oh my god. He's okay
[19757.26s -> 19759.58s]  Get inside of here
[19760.81s -> 19762.81s]  Why does this have to be so difficult?
[19762.97s -> 19767.37s]  It just is like I why is this so hard to make them stay in here?
[19769.32s -> 19770.92s]  You guys settling down
[19770.92s -> 19779.24s]  This thing is very intimidating
[19796.26s -> 19798.26s]  Wow, they're like prismatic
[19803.40s -> 19804.44s]  Cool
[19804.44s -> 19806.44s]  All right. What do they sell for? Let's get some money
[19809.08s -> 19811.08s]  Yeah, just for fun just for fun
[19811.80s -> 19814.49s]  Let's do let's make like mosaic cat
[19815.05s -> 19817.05s]  Why not? I'm done
[19817.53s -> 19821.02s]  This game is really fun. Well, i'm going to make mosaic cat for fun
[19821.66s -> 19836.02s]  Or mosaic rock
[19836.02s -> 19838.65s]  a guitar farm
[19838.65s -> 19841.45s]  Uh, it's I think that's too involved. I'm stream's gonna be over here in a minute
[19842.25s -> 19848.95s]  Okay, let's make a mosaic cat
[19851.24s -> 19855.83s]  Cool
[19855.83s -> 19873.64s]  Thanks for the kiss
[19873.64s -> 19877.30s]  cool
[19877.30s -> 19879.30s]  All right. Now these are mine sell
[19886.68s -> 19889.96s]  It's just kind of hell of that looks really cool. They'll go sparkles
[19891.00s -> 19894.65s]  Very sparkly
[19894.65s -> 19899.08s]  I love it. Very very cool. Let's sell these and then i'm going to
[19900.04s -> 19901.88s]  I'm gonna call it here
[19901.88s -> 19903.88s]  70 80 bucks each nice
[19914.82s -> 19919.54s]  Free the whole ranch. Uh, no. No, I because if I play off stream for any reason
[19920.34s -> 19925.08s]  I don't want to destroy the save file. I mean obviously put
[19925.72s -> 19931.86s]  Like what like 17 18 hours into the game so far. I don't think I want to just delete it
[19932.58s -> 19936.36s]  That was really cool. Very very good
[19937.08s -> 19940.84s]  This game i'm gonna give a rating. Here you go. Everyone wants me to rate games. Sure
[19941.48s -> 19952.73s]  This game is a
[19952.81s -> 19958.57s]  Hmm that's way higher than a seven
[19961.51s -> 19975.14s]  um
[19975.14s -> 19980.87s]  Much higher than 7.5. I don't think this I don't know. I'm not sure this is quite
[19981.43s -> 19983.75s]  I'm not sure this is quite 9.0 territory
[19985.77s -> 19987.13s]  might be
[19987.13s -> 19991.53s]  Hmm
[19991.53s -> 20002.15s]  It might be
[20002.15s -> 20007.90s]  8.7
[20009.10s -> 20014.60s]  This is an 8.7
[20014.60s -> 20016.60s]  Very very very very it's very very good
[20020.92s -> 20023.16s]  I would say this is probably one of the best games that came out in 2015
[20038.12s -> 20040.42s]  elaborate on that
[20040.42s -> 20043.14s]  How much more do you want me to elaborate that's not when it came out
[20044.61s -> 20046.61s]  B plus best game of 2015
[20047.25s -> 20049.25s]  What else came out in 2015 that you liked?
[20053.99s -> 20059.32s]  This is an 8.7. What have you rated 10 out of 10? Just curious
[20062.77s -> 20064.23s]  And then
[20064.23s -> 20066.39s]  Bloodborne's like a 9.7 for me 9.8
[20067.03s -> 20071.78s]  I mean, no 9. Yeah 9.7 because the points where he's taken off for that stupid ass swamp level
[20079.35s -> 20081.19s]  Undertale is 2015
[20081.19s -> 20085.46s]  Sounds like a pretty good year
[20085.46s -> 20090.45s]  I thought it was your favorite game. How is it not a 10?
[20093.08s -> 20095.96s]  well because
[20097.88s -> 20099.88s]  10 just seems too easy to give something
[20101.16s -> 20105.00s]  Nothing is perfect
[20105.00s -> 20111.65s]  Nothing is perfect
[20111.65s -> 20114.53s]  I have not come across a game that I thought was
[20115.17s -> 20116.21s]  Perfect
[20116.21s -> 20120.29s]  That has not happened yet
[20120.29s -> 20122.29s]  Well, hold on. Hold on
[20123.67s -> 20125.67s]  Team fortress 2 might
[20126.93s -> 20130.40s]  Might be close to perfect
[20130.40s -> 20132.40s]  Well, wait, hold on tf2
[20133.12s -> 20136.32s]  tf2 like circa
[20136.86s -> 20139.42s]  2014 like 2013
[20139.42s -> 20143.33s]  tf2 2013
[20143.41s -> 20145.41s]  It could be close to a perfect video game
[20150.54s -> 20154.46s]  If I would have to give tf2 a 9.9. I don't I mean
[20155.79s -> 20158.91s]  that seems so stupid to say that but it's
[20159.63s -> 20161.55s]  Probably a 9.9
[20161.55s -> 20165.90s]  And i'm trying to think of the reasons of why
[20167.97s -> 20169.49s]  and I think
[20169.49s -> 20171.97s]  for the most part
[20171.97s -> 20174.48s]  It was based around
[20174.48s -> 20175.44s]  Oh
[20175.44s -> 20190.27s]  Like some of the little things that irritated you about tf2. He gave spore an 8.7. Did no I didn't
[20190.83s -> 20194.16s]  Spore's an 8.5
[20194.16s -> 20195.60s]  Sorry underneath this
[20195.60s -> 20203.90s]  You think sacrificing tf2 for alex was a fair trade-off. I don't think they sacrificed tf2 for alex
[20203.90s -> 20208.38s]  They stopped really caring about tf2 more way before alex was a thing
[20209.02s -> 20217.97s]  Spore is like a 7
[20217.97s -> 20223.15s]  No, I didn't give spore a 3.5. I gave the civilization phase a 3.5
[20223.71s -> 20226.18s]  I gave the creature creator a 9
[20226.18s -> 20228.86s]  I gave the space like a 8
[20228.86s -> 20244.06s]  Or like a 7 and then I gave the tribal stage like a 7 spores a 9.8. Eh, I don't know about that
[20245.12s -> 20247.12s]  Space is an 8. No space is like a 4
[20248.56s -> 20258.27s]  That adds up to more than 10. Well, no, I'm rating the different portions of the game as 0 out of 10
[20259.09s -> 20261.25s]  I do that shit
[20261.25s -> 20263.57s]  Don't that's how we do this on this stream
[20264.21s -> 20267.25s]  Remember resident evil 7
[20267.25s -> 20271.17s]  The first I based it on time and and portions of games
[20272.18s -> 20274.18s]  different areas different acts
[20275.10s -> 20279.58s]  Well, what what act are we in and how shitty was this? Resident evil 7's first act
[20280.14s -> 20282.14s]  Was a 9.4 out of 10
[20282.64s -> 20283.92s]  resident evil's
[20283.92s -> 20285.60s]  second act was like a
[20285.60s -> 20288.32s]  Seven and resident evil's third act was like a two
[20289.12s -> 20299.62s]  Resident evil seven's third act is a literal fucking almost one out of ten. The first act is a fucking 9.4 9.5
[20301.34s -> 20306.86s]  So, I mean overall you think about okay, how how much and how are you weighting the third act?
[20307.60s -> 20312.82s]  What what what's the weight of the third act? What percentages is that is that weight?
[20315.41s -> 20317.41s]  The guy ended up giving resident evil 7 like a
[20317.57s -> 20324.03s]  I mean eight two or something
[20324.03s -> 20329.23s]  How good is the forest versus indigo quarry versus desert versus ancient ruins? Okay now here you here's the problem
[20330.37s -> 20333.89s]  Ancient ruins you heard me flip out a little bit. I thought that was a fucking four out of ten
[20335.04s -> 20336.64s]  I don't like that place
[20336.64s -> 20340.54s]  These are the first these first two areas
[20341.40s -> 20343.22s]  9.7
[20343.22s -> 20345.31s]  8.6
[20345.31s -> 20347.31s]  then that third area with the um
[20348.46s -> 20351.26s]  With the caves and the crystals in the cave system. That's like an that's like a
[20352.14s -> 20356.19s]  Look at 8.4. So I wait
[20356.91s -> 20364.72s]  That ancient ruins part like that's like that's like 10 weight. That's not like a full like 20 30 weight. Absolutely not
[20365.12s -> 20373.09s]  I could overlook it. It's all right. I I just I I wasn't a big fan of the ancient ruins place
[20373.17s -> 20381.17s]  I like the place after that the crystal place the part where you're on the boat in resident evil seven
[20381.49s -> 20384.88s]  I thought was just stupid
[20385.70s -> 20398.80s]  And I waited it kind of high because it was to kind of ruin the game for me. What would you give stardew?
[20399.28s -> 20400.96s]  It's at least a nine
[20400.96s -> 20402.58s]  stardew is probably like a
[20402.66s -> 20405.09s]  uh
[20405.09s -> 20407.09s]  Stardew's uh, hey
[20407.17s -> 20409.41s]  That's pretty that's close
[20409.41s -> 20411.97s]  Stardew's really close to being perfect as well. It is
[20415.89s -> 20418.37s]  Is it weird of me to say? Oh, no, that's so unfair
[20421.04s -> 20425.26s]  That's very close. It's probably like a nine eight
[20425.50s -> 20427.98s]  Star oh man stardew valley might be perfect
[20438.83s -> 20441.07s]  What was wrong with stardew valley that I didn't like
[20445.15s -> 20447.63s]  I don't know if I can think of anything that might be a perfect video game
[20448.27s -> 20454.35s]  But a stardew valley better than bloodborne
[20455.44s -> 20457.20s]  oh
[20457.20s -> 20461.49s]  Shit bloodborne is at 30 fps ps4 exclusive
[20463.44s -> 20465.68s]  has some technical problems
[20465.68s -> 20469.46s]  ran like shit in some areas and
[20470.98s -> 20474.18s]  There's one area of there's one or two areas in bloodborne that I wasn't a huge fan of
[20475.74s -> 20477.98s]  Stardew valley is oh, oh man
[20478.70s -> 20484.13s]  I don't know star. I started valley might be a 10
[20485.33s -> 20486.61s]  It could be
[20486.61s -> 20490.90s]  I don't know if i'm willing to give it that score though
[20496.24s -> 20499.60s]  Combat's not good in stardew. Yeah, but it's like that's like extra stuff
[20501.60s -> 20503.60s]  Yeah
[20503.60s -> 20507.76s]  There's such different games. I know they are start of no stardew valley is a 9.8
[20508.48s -> 20512.56s]  It's a 9 8
[20512.56s -> 20516.08s]  tf 2 is a 9.9 stardew valley is a 9.8 bloodborne is a 9.7
[20516.64s -> 20519.98s]  There you go
[20519.98s -> 20526.56s]  On diablo 2 9.9. That's not a game's like at its very core. That game is like a 7.4
[20533.50s -> 20535.68s]  but
[20535.68s -> 20537.76s]  The fun factor of diablo 2
[20539.36s -> 20545.07s]  Is like a 50 the fun factor of diablo 2
[20545.79s -> 20547.95s]  Way higher than a 7.4 is at least it's a 10
[20548.51s -> 20551.76s]  One of the most fun I've ever had playing a video game was diablo 2
[20555.65s -> 20556.85s]  What hades?
[20556.85s -> 20560.98s]  hades is a
[20560.98s -> 20565.58s]  Hades is like a 9.2. That's a 9.2. I don't know if I'd call it perfect
[20566.14s -> 20568.96s]  It's like probably 9.2 9.3
[20569.60s -> 20573.28s]  That's too high. I don't think it is. No, I don't think it is 9.2 is pretty high, but it is
[20574.00s -> 20576.24s]  You gave saw an 8.9. No, I I gave
[20576.80s -> 20578.80s]  Uh outer wilds at 8.9
[20580.66s -> 20582.66s]  And half of you wanted to kill me
[20588.70s -> 20593.74s]  You guys want me to give you my scores for video games, but if I don't do a high enough score for your favorite video game
[20595.14s -> 20597.38s]  I you want me to like drink poison
[20597.94s -> 20609.32s]  This dude's an 8.8. Eugene 8.7. Andy. I don't give everything an 8.7 or an 8.8
[20610.10s -> 20618.42s]  I just told you three games right there that were a 9 9 9 8 and 9 7
[20620.75s -> 20624.21s]  7.8. Andy. I what what other games have I given a 7.8?
[20624.85s -> 20631.81s]  sniper elite 3
[20631.81s -> 20634.69s]  Um, but maybe like a 5.5
[20641.82s -> 20645.82s]  Didn't I play that game for like two or three hours and I just said this game's not fun. I stopped
[20649.60s -> 20652.24s]  What? Rate the world of warcraft expansions
[20653.73s -> 20658.77s]  wrath of the lich king is is okay. Well, this is just in the universe of world of warcraft. This is not
[20659.49s -> 20662.85s]  In like the actual universe of all video games that I've ever played. This is just
[20663.65s -> 20668.61s]  Bracket put in brackets world of warcraft corralled in one spot wrath of the lich king is a 10
[20670.21s -> 20672.21s]  burning crusade is a 9.7
[20675.39s -> 20677.39s]  legion is a 9.5
[20680.18s -> 20699.66s]  And then everything else is a zero. That's it. It wasn't saying you loved the latest expansion
[20701.97s -> 20703.97s]  Well, actually, hold on. Hold on
[20703.97s -> 20708.21s]  Miss I miss a pandaria. Okay. Hold on miss a pandaria was like a six
[20709.15s -> 20711.46s]  Everything else is zero
[20711.46s -> 20713.86s]  I didn't I I played miss pandaria was okay
[20714.50s -> 20724.78s]  I'm just like still going here. I'm not even like playing the game. Just talking
[20725.34s -> 20730.32s]  Let's get to the end here. We can still talk but let's do the credits
[20733.70s -> 20736.18s]  You're just meandering around the ranch. I know
[20737.38s -> 20739.62s]  Uh, but yeah, we can keep talking while we see the credits
[20740.26s -> 20743.82s]  Thanks for the subs. Thanks for watching. Sorry. I missed a bunch of them
[20744.06s -> 20748.86s]  It was a huge 50 community sub drop that I just was I must have been screaming at the tv
[20749.34s -> 20759.73s]  What about jedi academy? Um comedy factor was like a 10
[20760.37s -> 20762.37s]  Video game factor was like a 7.4
[20763.58s -> 20776.14s]  Maybe even lower like a 6.8. What would you rate fistful of frags?
[20777.54s -> 20782.90s]  A solid 8.0 and I know that's a joke of a score, but it just is that's that's a fact
[20783.46s -> 20790.75s]  Now that's an 8.5. It is
[20790.83s -> 20792.67s]  I had so much fun playing that game
[20792.67s -> 20797.95s]  You know how desperately I wanted someone to make a fistful of frags into a full non-mod video game
[20799.89s -> 20804.37s]  Where it was just it was just a full triple a video game of that caliber
[20805.25s -> 20815.57s]  Uh too bad. I would love it red dead redemption 2. No, but red red red dead redemption 2 was not
[20816.43s -> 20817.93s]  an fps
[20817.93s -> 20832.06s]  Multiplayer shooter it would have been really good. I know rate day's gone and jump king day's gone is a four
[20832.70s -> 20839.62s]  jump king is a
[20839.62s -> 20849.20s]  7.9. What would you rate the last whopper? Uh, probably a five or six
[20849.92s -> 20855.55s]  Portal two stop ignoring me
[20856.70s -> 20859.82s]  Portal two when it came out I think was like a nine four
[20860.38s -> 20866.10s]  But portal two kind of five ten years later. I kind of almost looked back and it may have been too high
[20876.06s -> 20879.42s]  Maybe like if I were to go back and think about it without the like holy shit
[20879.42s -> 20884.93s]  This is the greatest thing i've ever played it my entire life. I feel like i've portals. Yeah, maybe like
[20885.09s -> 20886.86s]  Um
[20886.86s -> 20891.42s]  I haven't played it in a long time. I would probably say probably like a nine two nine three
[20892.00s -> 20895.12s]  I think it should be docked like point one or point two points
[20896.77s -> 20902.46s]  I had just I had just I was so excited for it that I was just clouded my face clouded my face
[20903.74s -> 20919.23s]  I gave it like a nine point five. It's probably like a nine points free. What about tetris?
[20920.24s -> 20931.23s]  I know the reason why I can't rate the portal games like tens like everybody else does because those games made me sick
[20932.38s -> 20937.70s]  I powered through playing portal one and portal two and it's like this is the this is so much
[20938.26s -> 20941.78s]  This is the funniest thing i've ever done. I love this game. It's so good
[20944.10s -> 20948.35s]  I had to lie down every couple of hours. I couldn't play that game for more than an hour or two
[20948.43s -> 20950.75s]  I had to go actually physically lie down or throw up at my desk
[20952.83s -> 20956.11s]  So I can't give it a ten. It made me almost throw up five times
[20956.67s -> 20969.09s]  So it's a nine point two
[20969.09s -> 20973.95s]  How do you play vr? Well vr is a lot different. You have a full
[20974.51s -> 20977.47s]  You have a full essentially a hundred eighty three sixty degrees of vision
[20978.86s -> 20979.82s]  it's the
[20979.82s -> 20985.18s]  Looking through the portals and moving around through the portals and jumping through them and doing the speed thing where you run
[20986.14s -> 20987.98s]  And then through another one
[20987.98s -> 20991.58s]  The world kind of turns sometimes in portal is here's the worst part about it
[20991.90s -> 20993.90s]  Sometimes in portal when you go through a portal
[20994.38s -> 21000.22s]  And your camera flips upside down right side up because you went through backwards or something and it's like you flip forward
[21001.10s -> 21017.22s]  That would kill me every time motion sick ridiculously easy
[21017.22s -> 21020.66s]  I wouldn't say ridiculously easy, but like enough where I it can be an issue
[21022.66s -> 21025.73s]  Sorry, what about noita?
[21027.84s -> 21029.84s]  Noita was not really my kind of game
[21030.64s -> 21034.08s]  I would say terraria was not my kind of game either and I put them in the same category
[21035.95s -> 21040.99s]  I love what terraria does and I like that terraria is cool and I think it's a really fun experience
[21041.47s -> 21043.47s]  But I don't know if I would rate terraria that high
[21044.03s -> 21046.03s]  It would probably be pretty low for me
[21046.03s -> 21053.15s]  They're not the same. Well, they're they're like this they're played very similarly. They're not the same exact game
[21061.65s -> 21065.33s]  I think they're really cool. They're just kind of not the type of game that I like to play
[21065.81s -> 21073.62s]  What about super mario bros 3?
[21077.04s -> 21080.32s]  Wait, there's a game ratings wiki page of mine
[21081.87s -> 21083.33s]  What?
[21083.33s -> 21085.33s]  No, there's not hold on a second
[21088.42s -> 21090.42s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
[21091.68s -> 21093.68s]  Why is among us up here as a 10?
[21094.94s -> 21098.30s]  That's somebody edited somebody's doing bullshit editing here
[21105.62s -> 21111.02s]  That shouldn't be up there. What why is a whopper on here? A whopper is not a game
[21117.12s -> 21121.36s]  What an art of wilds is is not even right either. Wait, didn't I i've read
[21121.52s -> 21133.98s]  I retroactively went back and gave art of wilds a 9.1 because I cracked under the pressure andy right it was it was an 8.9
[21138.96s -> 21147.04s]  Binding of isaac binding of isaac is is a 9 binding by isaac is a 9.0. Get that off among us a fucking 10
[21148.00s -> 21149.36s]  No
[21149.36s -> 21154.00s]  Even if I played among us, I probably wouldn't think it was that good of a game even if I played it
[21155.34s -> 21156.78s]  Not a 10
[21156.78s -> 21161.95s]  If I even if I if I was a big fan of among us, i'm not I wouldn't give it a 10. It would be
[21162.91s -> 21163.87s]  I don't know
[21163.87s -> 21165.95s]  I don't know. I haven't played it so I can't give you a rating
[21167.41s -> 21177.71s]  Refresh I just where is it?
[21180.74s -> 21182.74s]  Somebody linked to me again. I don't know. I can't get back to it
[21183.06s -> 21188.61s]  Stop ignoring hollow night. Um hollow night's probably like a
[21189.17s -> 21191.17s]  I can't give it a full. I didn't finish it
[21191.25s -> 21193.25s]  I feel like I would need to that's the kind of game that you need to finish
[21193.89s -> 21195.65s]  Before you give it a real rating
[21195.65s -> 21202.88s]  Binding of isaac 9.0 bugsnack 7.95. Why 9.5?
[21203.68s -> 21211.63s]  Germa won't write black and white 2 feels bad man. Hi germa lots of love from the navy. Well, thanks
[21212.51s -> 21214.51s]  black and white 2 um
[21215.58s -> 21220.38s]  Which one was better black and white 1 was better than black and white 2, wasn't it? I forget flip it around maybe
[21221.18s -> 21226.27s]  Black and white 2 was an 83
[21226.27s -> 21230.51s]  Black and white 1 was like an 86 flip it somewhere around if I forget which one was better
[21245.71s -> 21253.12s]  Asthma phobia 7 7.1. No, it's 7.0 dark souls 3
[21260.61s -> 21265.65s]  Dead rising. Yeah, okay dead risings dead risings probably like us
[21266.62s -> 21267.74s]  uh
[21267.74s -> 21271.71s]  Dead risings probably an 82
[21275.49s -> 21281.01s]  No, it's not it's higher than that. It's an 86 85 dead rising is an 85 dead rising 2 is an 85
[21281.17s -> 21283.17s]  I don't know. I don't rate video games
[21283.65s -> 21287.89s]  I just play them and think they're fun sometimes or I think they suck or I don't like them. I don't know
[21288.05s -> 21290.05s]  I can't rate video games
[21291.39s -> 21294.59s]  Sekiro, oh i'm gonna piss a lot of people off with Sekiro
[21295.23s -> 21299.15s]  Sekiro is the worst souls kind of like video game. It's the worst one
[21300.30s -> 21302.62s]  I think I gave it like a nine. I was lying
[21304.34s -> 21306.34s]  I gave it a nine. I was a liar
[21307.14s -> 21311.14s]  I was like, oh, you know, it's like a 9.0. I think after I finished it. I said that
[21311.78s -> 21314.19s]  I think that might be the worst one
[21314.19s -> 21318.51s]  No, dark souls 2 is way worse. Never mind. Okay. Well, I need to how many games have they made?
[21323.33s -> 21331.70s]  From software hold on
[21331.70s -> 21337.89s]  Okay. Yeah dark dark souls 2 is worse than uh, okay. Here we go. Dark souls 2 is worse than Sekiro
[21338.53s -> 21342.37s]  Dark souls 2 is like a 6.5
[21343.76s -> 21345.76s]  Sekiro is like a 7.6
[21350.27s -> 21352.26s]  dark souls
[21352.26s -> 21353.78s]  three
[21353.78s -> 21355.62s]  Is like an s
[21355.62s -> 21357.62s]  like an eight point
[21358.02s -> 21360.66s]  No, it's not. It's a eight point. It's an 8.1
[21362.34s -> 21364.34s]  Dark souls 1 is an 8.5
[21364.98s -> 21366.98s]  No, it's not. It's higher than that 8.8
[21368.38s -> 21371.58s]  Bloodborne is a 9.7. I don't do I don't even remember what they were
[21372.14s -> 21380.02s]  I think I think I honestly I think I just said random numbers there
[21380.58s -> 21390.56s]  No, let me get this right all the dark souls games besides dark souls 2 are eights
[21391.86s -> 21395.54s]  I think yes, that's accurate. I like I got all jumbled up here
[21396.10s -> 21399.30s]  Dark souls 2 is a 6.5. Sekiro is a 7.9
[21401.12s -> 21406.56s]  Dark souls 3 8.5 dark souls 1 8.9 darks, uh
[21407.12s -> 21409.12s]  Bloodborne 9.7 done
[21414.72s -> 21416.96s]  Did I say was that what I said twilight princess? I didn't finish it
[21418.67s -> 21420.67s]  These are getting updated
[21422.85s -> 21425.09s]  What about left for dead 2 who cares?
[21426.80s -> 21428.80s]  You don't need my opinion on this
[21428.80s -> 21433.68s]  You've already played like a thousand hours of that game. You want me to tell you what I think about left for dead 2
[21440.19s -> 21444.19s]  You we both have probably one to two thousand hours and left for dead and left for dead 2
[21444.91s -> 21447.22s]  I don't think it really matters what I think at this point
[21449.87s -> 21451.87s]  It's great. It was very very good
[21462.22s -> 21464.53s]  TV robo 9.9
[21466.13s -> 21474.03s]  9.0 day's gone as a four on here. Oh shit. It's almost six hours. You're right
[21478.03s -> 21479.71s]  He's obsessed
[21479.71s -> 21482.08s]  No more heroes one and two
[21482.08s -> 21487.39s]  No more heroes of the games are kind of bad, but in a really really charming good way
[21488.59s -> 21492.51s]  I think both no more heroes games are like seven one and like seven four
[21494.85s -> 21506.66s]  That's not really bad
[21506.66s -> 21511.23s]  Refresh the page
[21511.23s -> 21513.23s]  Yeah, can I I don't think spores in eight five
[21513.95s -> 21517.95s]  Oh, but what but it came out it was revolutionary left for dead 2 is who cares?
[21524.74s -> 21530.50s]  That's I mean, but really though, it's like so everybody played that game with shit load does it matter
[21535.62s -> 21539.22s]  All right. I'm only gonna write three more games watch dogs legion
[21540.03s -> 21543.31s]  Watch dogs legion realistically was a
[21544.17s -> 21545.47s]  4.6
[21545.47s -> 21547.13s]  that game
[21547.13s -> 21551.33s]  Sucks and i'm not afraid to say it
[21557.22s -> 21558.82s]  Was it better than day's gone?
[21558.82s -> 21567.71s]  You know, it might actually be worse than day's gone. What is day's gone of four if that's a caliber for four
[21568.03s -> 21570.03s]  Watch dogs legion is a 3.6
[21573.84s -> 21575.84s]  That's only because your computer sucks
[21579.23s -> 21584.83s]  What that's my that was my experience with watch dogs legions. It's a it's got a 3.6
[21585.47s -> 21598.66s]  I was flipper. I was flippers in 8.4
[21599.30s -> 21602.62s]  If i'm gonna be realistic about it one more
[21610.29s -> 21612.29s]  Skyrim I can't write skyrim
[21614.06s -> 21615.97s]  I played
[21615.97s -> 21618.14s]  Two or three hours of skyrim
[21618.54s -> 21620.54s]  Modded the hell out of it made a bunch of monsters
[21621.65s -> 21623.17s]  Never played it again
[21623.17s -> 21625.17s]  And then watched it re-release
[21625.17s -> 21626.85s]  15 fucking times
[21626.85s -> 21628.93s]  I can't give you a rating. That's not rateable for me
[21633.22s -> 21634.90s]  hotline miami
[21634.90s -> 21637.86s]  Hotline miami 1 is an eight point
[21640.61s -> 21643.89s]  Nine hotline miami 2 is a seven
[21657.14s -> 21665.39s]  rhythm heaven
[21665.39s -> 21673.68s]  eight eight point five
[21673.68s -> 21677.50s]  bta 5
[21677.50s -> 21680.54s]  9.5. No, it's not it's a nine point. Yeah, it is 9.5
[21681.18s -> 21692.14s]  Gotcha for us. The game is a probably like a five point six
[21693.28s -> 21696.40s]  But I loved it so much that it raises it up in brackets
[21697.04s -> 21699.04s]  It's a seven point six
[21699.36s -> 21704.10s]  For some it's a five point six video game, but in brackets, it's a seven point six
[21704.90s -> 21714.56s]  Outer wilds eight point nine and then in brackets nine point one
[21720.34s -> 21722.82s]  Refresh the page it got to the page is deleted
[21723.62s -> 21726.69s]  There's nothing in here. You guys somebody deleted it all
[21726.77s -> 21729.44s]  What the fuck
[21729.44s -> 21736.06s]  It's it's gone
[21736.06s -> 21738.70s]  All right. I'll see you guys later. Goodbye. Good night. I gotta go
[21740.88s -> 21742.88s]  The next time you see me will be
[21744.13s -> 21746.13s]  Uh, I will be back on monday
[21750.82s -> 21753.06s]  Either monday. Yeah monday i'll be back on monday
[21754.98s -> 21756.98s]  What time on monday though?
[21757.22s -> 21759.22s]  monday might be a later stream
[21762.74s -> 21765.94s]  We'll see maybe I gotta figure this out either monday or oh
[21769.74s -> 21770.70s]  I
[21770.70s -> 21771.90s]  hmm
[21771.90s -> 21775.30s]  I think I have an appointment on monday
[21776.08s -> 21778.32s]  We'll see check the sus it's either monday or tuesday
[21778.88s -> 21782.00s]  I'll see if I can stream on monday late if not then tuesday afternoon
[21784.96s -> 21787.41s]  great sorcery nine
[21787.41s -> 21790.21s]  sorcery one 9.0 sorcery two
[21791.73s -> 21793.49s]  9.8
[21793.49s -> 21795.33s]  sorcery three
[21795.33s -> 21797.33s]  7.5 sorcery four
[21798.37s -> 21800.05s]  6.8
[21800.05s -> 21803.22s]  Combine them all together sorcery two makes up most of the game
[21807.42s -> 21810.86s]  As a whole remember we weight them differently here. We weight them differently
[21813.12s -> 21814.40s]  I put
[21814.40s -> 21816.96s]  Like 75 weight into sorcery two
[21819.47s -> 21821.23s]  The rest of them just trickling
[21821.23s -> 21834.03s]  What do you mean? Wait w e i g h t
[21834.67s -> 21839.74s]  Go to bed jeremy. I mean, it's not that late
[21840.38s -> 21845.87s]  Right among us. I can't rate it n slash a not applicable. I have not played it
[21846.75s -> 21848.75s]  jewel wizardry, I mean
[21850.02s -> 21850.98s]  Two
[21850.98s -> 21853.38s]  That's a deck game is a two not even it's a 1.4
[21855.79s -> 21858.35s]  super frog super frog is a
[21861.62s -> 21863.62s]  a one but in brackets
[21864.40s -> 21874.51s]  9.5
[21874.51s -> 21876.51s]  Undertale. Oh boy
[21877.20s -> 21879.52s]  Oh boy, i'm about to rate
[21880.38s -> 21881.52s]  Undertale
[21881.52s -> 21883.12s]  This is where
[21883.12s -> 21886.80s]  This is where i'm good. Oh, this is best. It's gonna this is a monk a s scenario. I think
[21887.96s -> 21891.36s]  Undertale
[21891.36s -> 21893.66s]  Oh
[21893.66s -> 21898.14s]  If I gave outer wilds an 8.9 and I don't give undertale a 9.0
[21902.56s -> 21903.86s]  Undertale
[21903.86s -> 21905.86s]  Is definitely not
[21905.94s -> 21908.19s]  Um
[21908.19s -> 21911.07s]  This is a career end. This is a career ending statement possibly
[21916.13s -> 21920.64s]  It's it's a nine. It's at least a nine, but I don't know if it's I don't know if it's the nine that you think it is
[21931.88s -> 21933.88s]  zero point nine
[21936.85s -> 21948.67s]  Uh, it's undertale for me was a nine point nine point two
[21949.85s -> 21950.91s]  six
[21950.91s -> 21952.98s]  five
[21952.98s -> 21954.98s]  Not quite a nine point three, but it's almost there
[21966.42s -> 21968.42s]  And then in brackets for undertale
[21969.09s -> 21971.09s]  Point five one
[21985.38s -> 21989.30s]  Nine point two six five is locked in what about the brackets? You need the brackets are very important
[21990.02s -> 22003.63s]  And the mud the point five one gets added to the score. No, no, don't put the brackets there
[22005.47s -> 22011.38s]  Put no, no, no. Okay. What's the dude somebody do the math? What's the math? So it was nine point
[22013.49s -> 22015.49s]  Okay, you need to calculate it nine point
[22018.70s -> 22021.42s]  nine point six nine point two six five
[22024.05s -> 22025.41s]  plus
[22025.41s -> 22027.90s]  point five one
[22027.90s -> 22029.50s]  so in brackets
[22029.56s -> 22032.06s]  Undertale is a nine point. That's not accurate
[22032.86s -> 22034.86s]  No, no in bra and hold on
[22034.94s -> 22037.90s]  It would be point
[22037.90s -> 22039.90s]  All right in brackets. It's a nine point
[22040.52s -> 22041.98s]  three
[22041.98s -> 22043.98s]  Two zero nine point three two zero
[22044.22s -> 22067.12s]  Nine point three two zero in the brackets. I have to go. All right, well we're going brackets if we're multiplying
[22067.12s -> 22069.60s]  No brackets are four that could be the score two
[22070.75s -> 22073.63s]  On a given day. However, I might feel like giving it that one
[22073.79s -> 22078.35s]  I have to give two scores sometimes because on a given moment it could range between those two
[22078.67s -> 22080.67s]  It could be one of the it could be one of the other
[22081.15s -> 22087.74s]  All right. Good night. Goodbye. I'll see you later. I'll see you on monday or tuesday. Have a great weekend everybody. Take care of yourselves
[22088.38s -> 22090.38s]  Thanks for sticking around. Thanks for watching as always
[22091.07s -> 22092.56s]  See you soon
[22092.56s -> 22094.56s]  Good night. Goodbye
[22097.12s -> 22101.47s]  Rate your channel
[22101.79s -> 22104.99s]  Nine point eight five
