[0.31s -> 16.35s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with Facecam Fortress 2. Oh, that spy got in the damn way.
[16.35s -> 22.83s]  That heavy just got in the way too. Playing- what the hell is going on? Oh, it's a heavy down here.
[22.83s -> 25.31s]  I can't even tell you what's going on right now on my head.
[25.95s -> 29.41s]  So this is-
[29.81s -> 34.42s]  What the hell just happened right there?
[35.18s -> 41.14s]  Okay, so I'm wearing an unusual hat in real life. It's a burning Jerma head. They go for
[41.62s -> 48.37s]  like two refined metal. They're pretty cheap, but it really hurts to put this on. My whole head gets on fire,
[48.37s -> 52.01s]  and unfortunately, you get like third degree burns on your head, which is not good.
[52.33s -> 55.01s]  But anyways, I thought it would be funny just to have this on.
[55.53s -> 61.58s]  Unusual hat in real life. When I saw this effect in my little webcam manager there, I had to put it on.
[61.58s -> 66.50s]  I didn't even know it existed. But anyways, what am I doing as a sniper right now? I'm being a real-
[66.50s -> 68.86s]  Oh!
[68.86s -> 78.38s]  Get that guy too. Come on! Come on, hit the spy! They're the goddamn spy and I can't-
[78.94s -> 81.88s]  I'm gonna- Wow.
[83.00s -> 89.94s]  Look at this banana peel. Holy geez. That's been sitting there for like five days.
[89.94s -> 95.22s]  I probably ate that before I went to PAX. That's pretty gross.
[95.70s -> 102.25s]  So let's keep going here. Playing on 2 for it, which- I got actually a lot of requests to do this.
[102.29s -> 107.81s]  People want to see me play on 2 for it, and I really don't think I have one video on 2 for it.
[107.81s -> 112.51s]  This is probably the only one. Maybe one more. You know what? Screw this.
[113.19s -> 115.83s]  Okay, don't hit him. There we go!
[117.25s -> 122.71s]  Scope sniper. Doing default sniper pretty much. We're gonna get this cap right now, aren't we? We better.
[122.71s -> 126.25s]  Are you real or what? I don't know. I don't trust anybody.
[126.89s -> 132.34s]  Don't trust anybody. Oh, how come that didn't register?
[132.90s -> 139.23s]  Get it! Get him! Get somebody through this little hole.
[139.63s -> 148.69s]  So scared right now. Scope sniper on 2 for it. Just nonsense. That is a spy. Can't stand in the same way.
[148.69s -> 154.78s]  What are you doing over here, man? Oh, let's just stay-
[154.78s -> 162.47s]  Oh! God! How did this guy even get up here? How did a heavy just like waltz up here?
[162.59s -> 171.28s]  Now, there's one. Let's keep it rolling here, boys. Let's eat a raw, gross, rotten banana peel while we're at it.
[171.28s -> 177.56s]  I'm gonna throw that away. Holy- Oh, no, that's two! That's two scores right there.
[177.72s -> 183.66s]  All right. All right. I'm gonna go down to the bottom this time. I'm not gonna stay up here. Or am I?
[183.66s -> 193.12s]  Ah! Get out! I'm gunning for you, you mongrels!
[193.48s -> 201.08s]  Right here. I'm gonna stay right here for a minute. For just a minute. My unusual hat is like really itchy.
[201.20s -> 206.45s]  Is nobody gonna come out here? What's gonna happen? Come on.
[206.93s -> 212.48s]  They just capped one. Did that heavy just go all the way through and cap everything? Yes!
[213.00s -> 217.89s]  You're gonna get it right here, man. You are getting this right here. I'm gonna shoot you right in your face.
[217.89s -> 222.51s]  It's gonna go through your teeth and out the back of your neck. And no, it's gonna be this heavy, actually.
[222.51s -> 230.54s]  I'm gonna get the right opportune moment. No, it's gonna be this guy instead. Hey, it still works, right? I killed somebody.
[230.54s -> 235.82s]  Oh, you. Oh, you. Get out of town.
[237.10s -> 244.29s]  Don't want you here no more. And you are not- Yeah, you're real. Okay. I'm okay with that.
[244.29s -> 252.28s]  You're a real spy. Do your thing, man. What did that other- Heavy! Oh, you're dead heavy.
[252.44s -> 264.12s]  Boink! They're gonna win. They've capped twice now. We had two caps in the beginning. And where is this son of a-
[264.12s -> 267.83s]  I think it's time to go back upstairs.
[268.15s -> 274.26s]  Try to defend the intelligence because that's not gonna be good. If we just lose right now, I'm gonna be very mad.
[274.50s -> 285.72s]  Hey. Hey. No, you're real. How- What is- What's with all these like crazy heavies? At least we got a sentry now.
[285.72s -> 299.03s]  That's good. Good. Good. Spy is up here. Bang! Two in a row. Whoa. Where's this guy? Come here, you.
[299.03s -> 307.86s]  I'm gonna get this pyro. Oh, you know what? Let's- Let's cap this right now. Come on. Support. Support.
[309.91s -> 316.49s]  I would have got him. He has no idea. Oh, baby! Oh, baby! Am I gonna cap this right now?
[316.73s -> 323.43s]  Sniper cap for the win? Is this- Is this gonna happen? Whoa, what am I stuck on? Oh, the stupid teleporter.
[323.43s -> 333.77s]  Oh, this is gonna be a sniper cap right here, guys. This is gonna win it right now. Hell freaking yeah. Oh, yeah.
[333.77s -> 335.77s]  Oh, yeah. Wait, is it- Yeah, it's playing the three.
[337.30s -> 344.92s]  Bang, baby. Well, that was a nice round. I say, uh, go grab yourself one of these unusual hats.
[344.92s -> 348.20s]  They don't go for very much. And, uh, that's gonna wrap it up here, guys. So,
[348.94s -> 354.06s]  thank you guys so much for watching. Really do appreciate it. And, uh, now I gotta go douse my head in water
[354.06s -> 359.74s]  to get rid of this unusual hat. So, uh, see y'all next time. And, of course, take care, everybody.
