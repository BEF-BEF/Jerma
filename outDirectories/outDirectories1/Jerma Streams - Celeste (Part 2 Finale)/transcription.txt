[0.95s -> 9.43s]  Hey guys, how are you? How's your Saturday afternoon going?
[11.22s -> 15.54s]  Those of you on pacific time right now, we are still, we're still on Saturday.
[16.26s -> 25.72s]  I think it's uh, what is it, Wednesday for uh, some of you guys. That PST is three days behind, so
[28.71s -> 35.18s]  happy uh, happy Tuesday or Wednesday. The, the further you go along the, you know, the hemispheres
[35.18s -> 48.78s]  here. Imagine being still on Saturday. It'd be really weird. Those of you guys that don't understand,
[49.82s -> 57.82s]  if the world was much bigger, that would happen. If the earth was 10 times the size that it is,
[58.90s -> 63.94s]  and you had two places that were, and then the sun still traveled across the globe, you know,
[63.94s -> 71.61s]  the sun rotated around the earth still the way that it does, it would be Sunday when it was
[71.61s -> 83.83s]  Tuesday for some people. That's not how it works. Have you ever looked, have you ever looked in a
[83.83s -> 95.08s]  microscope before? You don't know how that works. Anyways, we're gonna play Celeste. We're gonna
[95.08s -> 101.43s]  finish it uh, fairly close to the end, so might as well do it. Long stream, because I think it's fun.
[102.07s -> 113.40s]  But yeah, if the earth was five times its size, can you imagine if the earth, if the earth was
[113.40s -> 125.66s]  10 times its size and the sun was half its size? What the heck would happen there? We'd be dead.
[126.30s -> 142.79s]  We wouldn't exist. Yes, we would. I would. I'd find a way. Uh, thank you Tim, Timmy, for the $50.
[143.67s -> 151.74s]  I hope you have a great stream. Also, I made this. Are you sure you did? Because there's a bunch of
[151.74s -> 160.33s]  people that are gonna counteract your point here in about five seconds. What did you make? This is
[161.90s -> 180.07s]  called Jerma Slap. All right, this is a Jermario Slap. Okay, that's pretty, that was pretty good.
[181.40s -> 189.54s]  That was pretty good. Very, that was actually really good. Show us? Uh, I can't, how come I can't link it?
[190.26s -> 197.86s]  I just, I just copy and pasted this. Why can't I? What the hell? I just, I just had it open.
[204.41s -> 211.08s]  There you go. Jermario Slap. Thank you Timmy. Thank you for the $50 too. I haven't even started yet.
[214.12s -> 217.64s]  Just turned the stream on already. Somebody drops a $50 fucking bill here.
[218.20s -> 226.46s]  5,000 bits. Thank you. And I don't think we need to waste very much time because we already know
[226.46s -> 236.49s]  what we're doing. Where is Shito? Shito is sleeping over here and he's not to be awoken. He's very
[236.49s -> 247.86s]  tired after last night. He was worked very hard. He sang his heart out for you guys and now he needs
[247.86s -> 258.94s]  a rest. Who is Shito? Oh, right. People that weren't here. I'll pick him up just very carefully.
[258.94s -> 266.31s]  Make sure that, no, he's still sleeping. He's still asleep. Maybe show him for a minute.
[273.21s -> 279.80s]  Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet. Don't wake him up. He likes to be held like this.
[282.74s -> 301.34s]  This is Shito. You okay? Yeah, he's fine. Back to bed. I know my hair is wicked fucked up because
[301.34s -> 307.30s]  I was in the wind. I know my hair looks like fucking al dente spaghetti today and that's
[307.30s -> 321.51s]  because I was out in the wind. I was in the wind. All right, so let's go ahead and put Celeste on
[321.51s -> 327.85s]  the screen. We're going to finish it. We're very, very close to, well, maybe not very close,
[327.85s -> 336.90s]  but we're definitely close to the end of the game. And why don't we get it on there right now? Hey,
[336.90s -> 347.77s]  look at that. Celeste. Your hair looks splendid today. Thank you. Hey, thanks. That's, I've never
[347.77s -> 357.13s]  heard anybody say that before. Oh my, holy crap. All right, so here are your options today. We've
[357.13s -> 364.33s]  got, um, we can climb the mountain in Celeste. We can check out the credits or we could find out
[364.33s -> 369.38s]  once and for all what the heck's in that cube. I think I'm looking forward to that. Trying to
[369.38s -> 384.10s]  figure that out. Wonder what Epic's going to do here. Doing the same, same joke from yesterday.
[384.90s -> 389.38s]  Yeah, I'll get, okay, synopsis. Here's the, here's the, here's the synapsis of this whole thing,
[389.38s -> 398.41s]  right? The whole story of Celeste is you got to climb a mountain and there are trials. You meet
[398.41s -> 404.33s]  somebody along the way. They got stuck in a, a Fortnite cube. When am I going to get that
[404.33s -> 408.81s]  thing open? You know, the guy gets stuck in a cube. You got to help him. You got to break him out.
[408.81s -> 417.91s]  You're being chased by a version of yourself and then you get to the top of the mountain.
[424.18s -> 429.11s]  Did you know it's impossible to outrun your own reflection? Well, it depends on if you're on the
[429.11s -> 451.02s]  moon or not because the moon's gravity is like 10% of earth. So it's Celeste part two. Theo,
[451.02s -> 459.46s]  you're awake. Am I? I'm skeptical. I had a messed up nightmare. Yeah, about that. Wait.
[460.66s -> 465.30s]  Oh, yep. It's all coming back to me now. It's all coming back to you. Boomerang
[465.30s -> 473.45s]  from Cartoon Network. That actually happened. Thanks for getting us out of there. I'm glad we
[473.45s -> 482.34s]  were in it together. I don't know if I could have done that alone. What? This is the first time you
[482.34s -> 489.85s]  get dialogue choices? It only took them like seven hours into the game. Wait, why am I playing as
[489.85s -> 495.27s]  this character? What's really going on here? Clay, this is, this is not a normal mountain.
[496.63s -> 502.90s]  What's really going on here? Should have told you sooner. Back at the old ruins, a part of me
[502.90s -> 509.78s]  escaped from a mirror. A part I'm not very proud of. I swear I dreamt it. You think the mountain
[509.78s -> 516.42s]  made her real? Yeah, she's been haunting me the whole time. She lashed out at Mr. Oshiro. I think
[516.42s -> 522.98s]  she was the reason the gauntlet stalled off. She was there in the temple. Oh, fucking, why didn't
[522.98s -> 527.06s]  you say something, kid? I wouldn't have gone into that temple if I knew that mountain was capable
[527.06s -> 534.18s]  of doing this shit. I try to stop you. You could have mentioned that your demon doppelganger was
[534.18s -> 541.94s]  on the loose. Come on, Theo. You know how crazy this sounds. I didn't even believe myself.
[543.46s -> 547.86s]  All right, all right, kid. I understand. Next time just talk to me though, all right?
[549.78s -> 559.02s]  Promise I'll believe you. Voice actor. Okay, which is the right one?
[560.34s -> 569.85s]  Hmm. Thank you for believing me. He's trapped in the bit for believing in me back there. I mean,
[572.18s -> 577.86s]  believing in you was the easy part. I wish I could have helped. I was pretty useless stuck in that
[577.86s -> 583.54s]  thing inside the cube. You actually helped a lot. Honestly, I couldn't have made it without your
[583.54s -> 593.43s]  support. I don't want to do that one. Let's do this one. Why is it so easy for you to trust me?
[594.39s -> 602.57s]  Seriously, you barely know me. Honestly, you remind me of my sister. That's adorable.
[603.13s -> 609.29s]  What's she like? Oh, you love her. Actually, you might not get along at first, but you eventually
[609.29s -> 616.63s]  would love her. She's a literal rock star. She's a musician, kid? That's so fucking awesome. All
[616.63s -> 622.31s]  right, I gotta get out of here. I gotta end the stream. Okay, she's not literally a literal rock
[622.31s -> 629.80s]  star. Alex is just amazing at everything. She's studying to be a civil rights lawyer.
[631.24s -> 636.47s]  Wow, how do I remind you of her? You both live so deep inside your own heads.
[637.27s -> 644.28s]  Oh, Alex has this amazing internal compass. It's obvious that she'll get where she needs to be.
[644.28s -> 648.84s]  I can see that in YouTube. I wish I could say the same for myself.
[649.08s -> 663.00s]  Uh, they're sitting real close to the fire. I'm just realizing this now,
[663.88s -> 670.55s]  which one of them's gonna put their hand in it to prove how good they are at video games, I wonder.
[671.35s -> 678.81s]  Your sister sounds great. Your sister sounds great. Really remind you of her.
[680.33s -> 684.09s]  That's a reference from last night if you weren't here. Are you kidding me? You're the one who's
[684.09s -> 689.45s]  dead set on climbing the mountain, and you don't even know why. That's classic Alex.
[690.33s -> 696.68s]  Huh? I'm just teasing you. Why are you climbing the mountain anyways?
[698.68s -> 703.64s]  I don't even know why. I just had to get out of my head. I'm stuck in a cycle.
[705.16s -> 709.72s]  You're preaching to the choir here. I've had many a soul-destroying day job.
[711.08s -> 716.76s]  Work is fine, actually. I just, uh, I'm going crazy. I can't think about dumb crap. It doesn't
[716.76s -> 723.00s]  matter. My brain fixates on these stupid things that happened forever ago. I should be over them.
[724.28s -> 733.99s]  None of it even matters. But, oh, you didn't say but. I'm good at keeping up appearances,
[733.99s -> 738.07s]  but the truth is I'm barely holding it together. Sorry, that's pretty rough.
[741.45s -> 750.62s]  Can I help? You already are. It feels good to say it out loud. You don't talk to anyone about it.
[751.34s -> 755.50s]  No, not really. My mom knows I get depressed and I have panic attacks. That's about it.
[757.34s -> 759.98s]  No wonder you feel trapped. How do you cope with anything?
[761.34s -> 768.90s]  I drink mostly and get mad at people on the internet. Get mad at people on the internet.
[772.34s -> 782.20s]  Uh, I should get some sleep. Oh, are you sure you don't want to keep talking?
[782.20s -> 790.76s]  I'm tired too, but we have a lot to talk about. Fucking internet. Wait, skip? What do you mean
[790.76s -> 799.03s]  skipping? I just said I was tired. Wait, I just told you I was tired. I didn't say I'm done with
[799.03s -> 809.24s]  the conversation. I wasn't trying to skip it. Not skipping. You're right, I can sleep later. See,
[809.24s -> 817.94s]  I just didn't know what to do. I'm just checking all the dialogue options. I should get some sleep.
[822.55s -> 828.46s]  Hey, what do you think built this temple anyways? It looks ancient. It must predate everything
[828.46s -> 834.30s]  else in the mountain. The resort, the ruins, the city. Either you skip or you stall. There
[834.30s -> 842.70s]  ain't no in-between apparently. There's a lot of history here. Yeah, the mountain has meant
[842.70s -> 849.24s]  so many things to so many people. Mountain is always, um, it's always really, really pointed
[849.24s -> 856.07s]  out here. We're not really on a mountain. There's going to be some invisible link scenario where
[856.07s -> 862.49s]  they're going to be wiped away and it's going to be like this forest has meant so many things.
[862.49s -> 865.13s]  They're going to be a forest. Just watching. There's going to be trees behind me. There's
[865.13s -> 869.62s]  going to be birds. That's where the bird comes from. I don't understand why that crazy old
[869.62s -> 877.05s]  lady lives here. You ran into her too. What's her deal? I think she's just a mean person,
[877.69s -> 887.72s]  but she does seem pretty content living out here. Would you mind talking about what depression is
[887.72s -> 895.70s]  like? It sucks. It's kind of hard to do it. That would be hard to answer. Yeah, but what does it
[895.78s -> 902.92s]  feel like? Alex struggles a little too. I really want to understand. We can talk about something
[902.92s -> 910.30s]  else if you want. It's like I'm at the bottom of the ocean. I can't see anything in any direction.
[910.30s -> 919.19s]  It's claustrophobic, yet I feel exposed. I remember feeling normal, but now it just feels
[919.19s -> 923.35s]  out of reach no matter what I try. And again, I was probably always messed up.
[926.17s -> 932.44s]  It just took something hurtful to bring it out. There must be something wrong with me.
[933.54s -> 941.48s]  No, Mary, I don't believe that. What happened? I'm sure it's not your fault.
[947.26s -> 956.17s]  By the way, if you are depressed and you're having problems, it's sometimes not in your control.
[957.37s -> 961.82s]  So blaming yourself is the worst possible thing you can do.
[962.62s -> 967.18s]  Because a lot of times it has something to do with something you can't even control yourself.
[972.42s -> 977.40s]  I guess I thought that I could. I don't know. I'm just floating in this abyss,
[977.40s -> 984.02s]  swimming in a random direction, hoping that I find something that's really why I'm here,
[984.82s -> 994.20s]  but I can't escape myself. I'm literally fighting myself the entire way. Maybe this is all pointless.
[996.58s -> 1006.06s]  John, you just saved my life. That's not pointless. Yeah. Look, you're a good person.
[1006.06s -> 1009.26s]  You're a little intense, but you're a good person. I think you're just trying to push
[1009.26s -> 1015.42s]  out of that rut you're stuck in. And that's a totally legit reason to climb the mountain.
[1016.74s -> 1023.66s]  Maybe. That's helpful. This part of you that's haunting you, maybe she comes with the territory.
[1024.70s -> 1031.86s]  So you think I'm stuck with her forever. Well, she's stuck with you too. That's not helpful.
[1038.23s -> 1045.66s]  So you want to destroy this part of you. Won't that hurt you too? If I don't, she's just going
[1045.66s -> 1050.22s]  to keep bullying me. She says she's protecting me, but that's obviously not true. Maybe she
[1050.22s -> 1058.46s]  thinks she is. She could be some kind of twisted defense mechanism. Honestly, who cares? She has
[1058.46s -> 1065.82s]  so much control over me. I hate it. Maybe you can learn to control her instead. The father,
[1065.82s -> 1073.10s]  the feather helps a lot. Thanks for teaching me that. The father, like just one of my grandpa's
[1073.10s -> 1082.23s]  many knuckets of wisdom. Father, the priest. That's what I got out of that somehow. I don't
[1082.31s -> 1092.63s]  know. My brain is... What brought you to the mountain? Why are you on the mountain? Why are
[1092.63s -> 1098.30s]  you here? What brought you to the mountain? I'm just kind of bumming around as usual.
[1099.26s -> 1104.46s]  Started this new job in Ohio. I thought I finally knew what I was supposed to be doing with my life,
[1104.46s -> 1110.06s]  but I hated it. So I quit after a week and I hopped a bus to Canada. I just felt this urge
[1110.06s -> 1117.98s]  to get lost in the middle of nowhere. Now that I'm saying it out loud, I realize how flaky it sounds.
[1118.70s -> 1127.88s]  That's a day-old joke. That's not a day-old joke. That's a game, a current game reference.
[1128.76s -> 1135.56s]  Just because we said this yesterday, we're in the same game. We got the same references
[1136.28s -> 1142.02s]  because we're doing the same thing, right? It just sounds like you're under a lot of pressure.
[1142.98s -> 1147.54s]  Not really. Everyone is so patient with me though. I guess I'm putting a lot of pressure on myself.
[1147.54s -> 1150.90s]  People always think I'm comparing myself to Alex, but I swear that is not the problem.
[1151.78s -> 1153.62s]  I'm just worried that I'll never figure out where I'm going.
[1156.44s -> 1159.48s]  You said you wanted to feel lost. Maybe you should just embrace that for now.
[1161.30s -> 1176.78s]  Maybe. Same game, same jokes. That's not a joke. I just said he was probably from some random
[1176.78s -> 1183.74s]  city in America, like Ohio, and it turned out to be Seattle. So in my headcanon, it's Ohio.
[1183.74s -> 1202.20s]  Where's the auto-clicker? That's a boring headcanon. Why? What? Be close to your
[1202.20s -> 1207.32s]  grandmother. Are you close to your grandfather? Are you close to your father? Yeah, I was.
[1208.28s -> 1217.86s]  Oh, I'm sorry. It's okay. That's just how it is. All I can do is stay positive and live a
[1217.86s -> 1231.30s]  meaningful life because that's what he would want. I'm so sorry, Keel. Thanks. You know what? I want
[1231.30s -> 1252.98s]  to remember this night. Let's take a selfie. I thought you'd never ask. You know, despite
[1252.98s -> 1257.86s]  everything, I feel pretty good right now. Wait a second. You're going to reach the summit tomorrow?
[1260.92s -> 1269.42s]  Don't junks it because I am currently John Junks. I tried with that one. Yeah,
[1269.42s -> 1274.46s]  I'm excited. I'm ready to put this all behind me. I'll be cheering you on. Yeah, but that's
[1275.02s -> 1278.94s]  if I'm in a Jax moment, if Jax takes over and does really well and I fail,
[1280.22s -> 1283.98s]  I jinxed myself. I Jonksed myself. That's a Jonks moment. That's a Jonks. That's a Jon.
[1284.54s -> 1287.42s]  Figured it out. Got it. I'll be cheering you on. We should get some sleep.
[1288.54s -> 1291.42s]  Okay, good night, Theo. Thanks for being cool.
[1294.14s -> 1308.63s]  What can I say? What can I say? Comes naturally. Let me just make sure I got that good feel here.
[1309.59s -> 1326.76s]  I do. All right, grab it. Okay, you go supersonic. New mechanic, supersonic. You gotta dash into
[1326.76s -> 1336.30s]  these ones. I'm probably missing a secret or something. What is he saying, Smash Brothers?
[1337.02s -> 1343.80s]  He growls and he says, now I'll show you where he goes. No, I'll show you. That's exactly how he
[1343.80s -> 1348.04s]  does it too. Like you might've thought that was like terrible and we're dropping frames here. Oh,
[1348.04s -> 1366.36s]  fuck. The Northern lights are so beautiful. Yeah. Where are we? We need to talk. Okay. Wait, am I?
[1366.36s -> 1377.98s]  Did I get to the summit? I'm above the summit. I did it. I finally understand who you are. You're
[1377.98s -> 1385.56s]  not my true reflection. I'm not. You're everything I need to leave behind. You're cruel, paranoid,
[1385.56s -> 1393.30s]  controlling. Why would you say that? No, it's okay. I understand now. I don't need you anymore.
[1395.27s -> 1403.43s]  So you're just abandoning me. I'm setting you free. We'll both be so much happier. You're so,
[1404.95s -> 1413.69s]  so stupid. You think you can just leave me behind? You think you can blame everything on me?
[1413.69s -> 1424.95s]  You think you're above me? That's it. I'm crawling out of the panel. Answer me. Calm down. Calm down.
[1426.74s -> 1445.61s]  Breathe. Use the feather. But I don't have my, I don't have my box. It's gonna take me a minute.
[1445.61s -> 1454.31s]  Unless you would probably be pretty hard to breathe right now with a tendril wrapped around my
[1454.31s -> 1464.50s]  diaphragm squeezing, right? I didn't do it. You're going to think about a feather to stop me.
[1469.94s -> 1475.30s]  You are not above me and you can't climb this mountain. It's time to accept that.
[1476.26s -> 1498.02s]  Oh, what's happening? Oh, God damn it.
[1503.85s -> 1514.04s]  Glass. Oh, come on. That's all right. I fell a long way. I did the movie fall
[1515.19s -> 1521.10s]  where you fall an incredibly long way, but you land on something that will save you every time.
[1521.10s -> 1533.00s]  Secret? Couldn't get the landing. No, I couldn't get the, I'm making a joke for the video landing
[1533.90s -> 1538.54s]  where I land and go two. That's what I was going to do. I was going to say two
[1539.83s -> 1544.07s]  and it's funny. 20 hindsight here. Looking back that actually would probably not have been funny
[1544.07s -> 1550.31s]  at all. All right, let's see. You're going to bring you over here. What's down here?
[1550.31s -> 1565.91s]  Maybe smash through here. Back up maybe. What about down here? I think I'm going to ride you back up.
[1581.64s -> 1601.16s]  Oh, feather. Oh, all right. Now what? I guess just go up. Is there any water
[1601.88s -> 1612.92s]  inside the water fountain? Well, I don't know. Okay, I want you to take a look at what just
[1612.92s -> 1618.76s]  happened there. I'm very serious. I'm very curious and serious about this. I pressed up on the
[1618.76s -> 1624.28s]  controller straight up and I went left and right. I want to make sure you understand. I just need to
[1624.28s -> 1644.66s]  make sure people know that. I didn't do that. Let's see. Take this over here. Wait, no. Can he break
[1644.66s -> 1679.38s]  all that? Hold on. I think I can break all that shit up there. No, fuck. No. That's kind of awkward
[1679.38s -> 1684.09s]  to do. All right. Tell me if I'm wasting my time here. Can I actually have him go up and break
[1684.09s -> 1698.01s]  through that? Or is this just a waste of time? Maybe it might be possible. I'll try it one more
[1698.01s -> 1726.47s]  time. I don't care. I don't care if it's a hundred thousand extra points. It is possible,
[1726.47s -> 1755.14s]  isn't it? I guess it doesn't matter at all. Shit. It's very easy. Well, obviously not considering I
[1755.14s -> 1802.20s]  couldn't do it. Oh, shit. Okay. Come on. This way. To the right. It's a giant mirror. I was so close.
[1802.20s -> 1811.45s]  It's over now. Why won't she leave me alone? I hate her. I'll never be able to get rid of her.
[1811.93s -> 1819.21s]  And she was right. I couldn't climb the mountain. No, that's not. I'm still on the mountain. So,
[1820.09s -> 1827.00s]  you know what I mean? I did. I did climb the mountain. Don't let people in chat tell you
[1827.00s -> 1833.90s]  you didn't do it. Don't let them get that. Don't let them say that. They'll use the little semantics
[1833.90s -> 1843.19s]  to make it so you didn't climb it. You got to the top of that mountain. You fell off the top of the
[1843.19s -> 1858.50s]  mountain, but you still got up there. You flew to the top. That's cheating. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. No.
[1859.06s -> 1864.10s]  See, there they go. There they go again. Use the semantics to try to tell you you didn't do
[1864.10s -> 1892.78s]  something. Oh, fuck. Wrong way. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I don't know why.
[1892.78s -> 1896.54s]  This, for some reason, this, this, this thing in particular is just my brain and has trouble
[1896.54s -> 1906.22s]  doing this of all the things in the game. Can I go through the top? I might be able to break
[1906.22s -> 1933.22s]  through the top. Where's the shot? You conquered the mountain horizontally. I guess I'm just supposed
[1933.22s -> 1938.25s]  to go up there with the feather, but I'm gonna be out the side here. What's over here?
[1939.21s -> 1976.94s]  Okay. Well, there's this. I can get that. Fuck. Come on. Oh, no. Oh, I got it. I don't know what
[1976.94s -> 1986.12s]  the hell's up here. I'm gonna just look. Nothing. So, I gotta go to the left, but man, I'm gonna
[1986.12s -> 1995.69s]  fall because I don't know what's over there. Oh, but what about, what, what's over here?
[1997.05s -> 2007.64s]  Shit. I can't hold on to anything. Oh, god damn it. All the way to the left. Well,
[2007.72s -> 2031.40s]  might as well get it. I'm here. Okay. Let's go. Oh, okay. Nothing else up here.
[2032.44s -> 2066.09s]  I mean, there is, but oh, oh, time to get trapped in a puzzle. What can I do? Can I even do anything?
[2066.73s -> 2091.22s]  I have to sing. Didn't I just try to do that? I swear to god, I dashed into that. All right.
[2091.22s -> 2104.68s]  Look at the bottom here. So, we've got play, pause, play in reverse. No, we've got play.
[2105.64s -> 2120.74s]  Yeah, pause. Okay. I don't think I can even do anything with this. Did I touch them? There's
[2120.74s -> 2136.10s]  something missing here. Maybe I have to get it. I can't do anything with this statue, right?
[2139.62s -> 2158.82s]  It's the infinity gauntlet. Well, I really, I don't have any idea.
[2158.98s -> 2169.14s]  Okay. Elevator close button. The hell is the elevator close button?
[2173.75s -> 2192.17s]  You should have jumped for the platform. It's a dash pattern. Okay. Well, how do I know what
[2192.17s -> 2201.03s]  sound it is? Those are all. Okay. So hold on a minute. Wait, wait, wait. There's two light
[2201.03s -> 2213.50s]  purples. I don't know what it, I don't know what the sequence would be though. The pattern comes
[2213.50s -> 2220.28s]  from chapter one. Okay. So I'm, I mean, at this point I'm in the room. There's no way I can do
[2220.28s -> 2234.58s]  it unless I go back to chapter one. Well, I guess I can't do it. It's impossible. Okay.
[2235.30s -> 2250.44s]  Could just Google it. Yeah, but I could, I could. What is it? What is it? What's the secret?
[2251.83s -> 2260.90s]  You want it? Yeah. What is it? Cheating. I'm cheating. Well, I didn't get the thing in the
[2260.90s -> 2266.10s]  first chapter and like, I want, I want to do that. I want it. What's the password?
[2275.80s -> 2282.82s]  It comes up later. Does it? I highly recommend you just skip this.
[2289.66s -> 2295.48s]  No, that's, did you give me the Konami code? That's not the correct, what, how do I do it?
[2296.36s -> 2319.91s]  That one didn't work either. Okay. It's a secret that I didn't get. It's a thing I missed in the
[2319.91s -> 2335.03s]  first chapter. I'm sure it's fun in there. Up, up, down, down. Stop. Up, up, left, right, left,
[2335.03s -> 2351.18s]  right, down, right, up. Stop. No. God damn it. Up, up. Do it again. Use the handy IGN guide. I can't
[2351.18s -> 2375.54s]  click on that. That means I have to alt tab. Up. I didn't do anything. Press play first.
[2377.38s -> 2400.71s]  You guys are putting random shit in here. Up. It didn't work. I'm not doing diagonal dashes.
[2403.00s -> 2409.88s]  You guys didn't say diagonal. You're saying left. Oh, you're saying what? No, say D. Up,
[2409.88s -> 2421.40s]  up, right. God damn it. Up, left, down, right. Up, left, down, right.
[2424.70s -> 2442.44s]  Just too many things. Just clear it. Clear it. Clear it. Got it. All right. What's,
[2443.00s -> 2450.44s]  hold on a second, guys. Is, wait, wait, wait. Let me be very, very, I gotta ask this. I need a mod
[2450.44s -> 2453.64s]  to answer this question because I don't trust anybody in here giving me up, up, down, downs.
[2454.60s -> 2461.26s]  Um, is that, that first one I didn't know, but am I about to just cheat through the whole thing?
[2461.26s -> 2465.74s]  Like what, do I not have the information to do the rest of this or will I get it eventually?
[2470.01s -> 2473.77s]  So don't just do this. Like that first one I didn't know because I wasn't going to get it.
[2476.38s -> 2508.50s]  Baked flakes. Who cares? No, I'm not doing it. I got the one that I couldn't get. I'm going to move
[2508.50s -> 2514.79s]  on. I'm going to, no, I'm not cheating. No cheating. I look, I'm the villain in the movie
[2514.79s -> 2539.42s]  that realizes what he's doing is wrong. No, fuck. You know what I'm saying? Like I can't,
[2539.42s -> 2552.78s]  I can't just have you guys give me the answers. Nothing up there. All right. What's the next one?
[2562.52s -> 2577.54s]  Let's just get, just do it. Who cares? Who gives a shit? What's this next one? All right. Torch three.
[2581.75s -> 2585.26s]  Just looking up on your phone. Up, up, down, down. Nope.
[2596.58s -> 2604.98s]  Fuck. I missed it. I didn't get it right. All right. What's torch four?
[2621.00s -> 2647.74s]  I don't fucking remember I did this. Okay. All right. Got it. I did it. Now everybody can go back,
[2647.74s -> 2658.79s]  go back to bed. I cheated. No, you cheated. Hey, I may have committed the crime, but you drove
[2658.79s -> 2663.59s]  the car. No, no, no, no, no. I drove the car. This is my stream. This is my broadcast. I'm,
[2664.23s -> 2669.51s]  I'm the driver. You committed the crime. I'm the driver. In fact, you're way more at fault than I
[2669.51s -> 2675.82s]  am. You're going to go to jail for way longer. And yes, I am the driver. I may have told you
[2675.82s -> 2692.17s]  to commit that crime, but you still committed it. I said, Hey, can you like commit that crime for me?
[2692.17s -> 2708.12s]  I'll drive you if you do. And you're like, sure. Okay. Then I open it. I opened it.
[2708.12s -> 2724.71s]  But one of these, it's going to be a cassette tape. Yeah. If they're not over 18, it's the
[2724.71s -> 2753.32s]  adult who is driving that is at fault. Oops. Oh, fuck. Oh my fuck. Oh my God. What did I do that
[2753.32s -> 2787.46s]  for? I'm a fucking God. I'm a God. I'm going to B-side. Now where the hell do I go? There's a way
[2787.46s -> 2799.72s]  to the right. What are you guys writing? Up, right, up, left, right. Stop giving me codes
[2799.72s -> 2804.60s]  for the crystal room. I already did that. I don't know where to go. I don't know where to go now.
[2805.32s -> 2807.88s]  You guys are writing codes for the crystal room. We already did that.
[2813.78s -> 2848.07s]  Bottom right, top left, top right, right, right. Don't do it. Don't. I can leave the screen by
[2848.07s -> 2857.66s]  going this right. Oh, what if I go up, up, right, right, up, right? Oh, okay. I hold on. Up, up,
[2857.66s -> 2879.50s]  up, right, up, right. Nothing? No. Just climb the mountain. There has to be a reason why I
[2879.50s -> 2895.91s]  can get in here. Nah. I don't even need that thing. Watch this. Okay. I think I need that thing.
[2897.62s -> 2940.76s]  Oh, shit. Fuck. This can't go up, can it? No. Just climb it. Oh, all right. Okay. Okay. Okay.
[2940.76s -> 2945.64s]  Okay. For some reason, I thought I had to go up. There's two walls and a long corridor going up.
[2945.64s -> 2961.18s]  I thought I had to jump it. Oh, shit. I have to grab onto the other side. Oh, my God. That's
[2961.18s -> 2986.92s]  actually going to be kind of annoying. I'm telling you, these block people are causing me huge
[2986.92s -> 2994.47s]  problems. It's because when I was bouncing off, I didn't know. Look, have you seen me fuck up the
[2994.47s -> 3028.92s]  feather once? Oh, fuck. Okay. I need to stand up, I think. Stand up and I don't know. I have to jump
[3028.92s -> 3050.02s]  just like launch. Okay. Fine. Zoom. I hate these things. I really do. I don't like these things.
[3051.70s -> 3066.46s]  You have to jump and then fall and grab. I could have gone up. What is that thing?
[3072.90s -> 3091.98s]  Pinball? It is pinball. Anything I can do in here? Let's see what's up.
[3108.18s -> 3116.62s]  I'm just going to keep going until I run into something. Down or up?
[3117.18s -> 3156.89s]  I guess I'm going to do down. Oh, it's a bubble. What am I supposed to do? I'm going to break them
[3156.89s -> 3161.21s]  all because I'm going to take a guess here and say that I have to fly through all of this
[3162.09s -> 3185.58s]  or something. I wonder if I'm correct. Nothing else in any of these walls. Break this one
[3189.19s -> 3196.42s]  up and around. If I was a video game, I would definitely have a scenario where I have to fly
[3196.42s -> 3239.21s]  through this. But oops. I have to bounce off. All right. Now what did I hit? Should I just smash
[3239.21s -> 3257.05s]  into these things? That has to be a point to that, right? Is there no point to click
[3257.05s -> 3282.41s]  feather? Minus two for the scream title. Oh, I forgot about the scream title. You're right.
[3284.82s -> 3291.94s]  Come on. What's the point of this? Nothing at all. I don't believe that at all. I'm sorry.
[3291.94s -> 3315.35s]  I put it down. Am I in a maze or something or am I just progressing in a way that I can progress?
[3316.55s -> 3332.17s]  Just skip that one, right? Okay. You got to go bounce from that top right one to the bottom
[3332.17s -> 3353.61s]  left one. Stop saying passwords for the thing. Well, that was wrong. I guess I have to dash
[3353.61s -> 3380.65s]  left into it. Flame Xbox. Just use cheats. Bubble. I was pretty good at this in Yoshi's Island.
[3380.65s -> 3391.98s]  The helicopter levels. You're probably wondering, my god, how does he do it?
[3394.63s -> 3418.73s]  My hands were on the controller so it might work. The helicopter levels were great. They were really
[3418.73s -> 3433.72s]  fun. I made it to the lift. Oh, hello again. Of course you're here. He really doesn't seem like
[3433.72s -> 3444.26s]  he enjoys the game and is just panicking about how he has to play it right. What? I think this
[3444.26s -> 3463.11s]  game is great. It's hard. You can't do it perfect the first time. What? Didn't we already go over
[3463.11s -> 3473.74s]  this? Okay, if you made me a treasure map and you made a bunch and I've never seen... You made me
[3473.74s -> 3478.60s]  a treasure map in a state I've never been to before. Jeremy, I've got a really cool treasure
[3478.60s -> 3483.00s]  map for you. What you're going to do is you're going to find a treasure and I've hid it somewhere
[3483.00s -> 3487.16s]  and there's an elaborate set of instructions that you're going to go through. All right, cool.
[3487.16s -> 3490.76s]  And you hand me the paper. You hand me the treasure map. I've never been to the state of Utah
[3490.76s -> 3497.64s]  before in my life. It's in Utah. And I close the door in the car, right? Like I get in the car and
[3499.56s -> 3507.67s]  door closes. Engine turns on at the window. Roll the window down. Yeah, what's up, man?
[3508.31s -> 3516.23s]  Hey, why have you not been to the treasure yet? What are you talking about, man?
[3518.33s -> 3526.28s]  Why did you... You were supposed to take a left at the statue at the interstate 91. I know,
[3526.92s -> 3531.56s]  but I don't know that. I have the treasure in my hand. You just gave it to me. I'm trying to...
[3531.56s -> 3535.08s]  I don't... I didn't... I haven't seen that. I've never been to the state before. Wait, hold on.
[3535.08s -> 3544.52s]  You've never been to Utah before? You're terrible. Okay, thanks for the treasure map, by the way.
[3544.52s -> 3561.50s]  Okay, like roll the window up and then I leave. And then you throw in a rock when I'm leaving. No,
[3561.58s -> 3567.80s]  what I'm saying is there's no way to play the game right. I've never even seen the game.
[3569.24s -> 3584.62s]  I'm getting new mechanics introduced to me on an hourly basis. You didn't take a left at that road
[3584.62s -> 3597.26s]  that you had never been on before. Well, I got to read the map first, man. It was just one guy.
[3598.06s -> 3619.40s]  It's over. It's probably for the best. No treasure for you. Utah hater. What? I've just said I've
[3619.40s -> 3626.34s]  never been to Utah. That's a whole nother map you just made for me. No, you just like doctored
[3626.34s -> 3634.94s]  chat footage of me. The mountain doesn't pull any punches. Yeah, I get it. I wasn't strong enough
[3634.94s -> 3642.34s]  to climb your stupid mountain. Long story short, this game's a lot of fun and I've been very much
[3642.34s -> 3646.18s]  enjoying this game. I hate the game. Where are you getting that from? What treasure map have you
[3646.18s -> 3657.56s]  handed me? I wasn't strong enough to climb your stupid mountain. You can laugh at me again all you
[3657.56s -> 3673.90s]  want. I didn't mean actually laugh. He hates this game. Why would I stream it for another day in a
[3673.90s -> 3679.96s]  row if I hated the fucking game? Sometimes you gotta know when to throw in the towel.
[3680.52s -> 3688.18s]  You'll get over it. You know what? I had a lot of time to think climbing out of this cave
[3688.90s -> 3703.40s]  and I'm already over it. That part of me was right. I can't do this. I'll just go home to my sad life
[3703.40s -> 3712.84s]  and be miserable forever. You clearly aren't over it. I don't want to give up, but no matter how hard
[3712.84s -> 3717.96s]  I try, she sabotages me every step of the way. A lot of kids come here to climb this mountain only
[3717.96s -> 3723.99s]  to give up. It's a shame that you fell. I was starting to think you'd make it. What makes me so
[3723.99s -> 3731.37s]  special? I've never met someone so angry at themselves. Honestly, I thought you'd reached
[3731.37s -> 3740.12s]  summit just to spite yourself. Gee, thanks. This girl you're talking about, it sounds like she's
[3740.12s -> 3747.51s]  holding you back. Talk to her. Figure out why she's so scared. You think she's scared? I guess I never
[3747.51s -> 3754.23s]  thought of it that way. Stop wasting both of our time and ask her, what have you got to lose?
[3755.03s -> 3771.83s]  I don't know how to find her. She's part of you, right? If you look for her, she won't take long
[3771.83s -> 3780.20s]  to find. So you know about the mountain's power. Of course I know. I live here. I tried to warn you.
[3781.08s -> 3787.80s]  You need to work on your messaging. I'm sorry for being the one guy. Well, it happened again
[3788.98s -> 3793.22s]  and that's twice in one stream and that you know that that gets you. I'm not supposed to be doing
[3793.22s -> 3804.42s]  that. A glimpse of the truth is good for people even if most can't accept what they see. Why would
[3804.42s -> 3810.18s]  I ban them? What are you talking about? That's a valued member of this community. They're not
[3810.18s -> 3816.92s]  going to get banned. There's no shame in running back to your car and driving away. Hey, hey,
[3818.63s -> 3830.33s]  why are you not in Utah yet? No, no, I just closed the door. Where can I find a fucking rock?
[3830.97s -> 3838.38s]  Someday you'll be ready and then you'll come back. No, I'm gonna see this through.
[3839.10s -> 3848.31s]  No shame in driving to Utah. Oh, that's right, I gotta stop. I gotta be very quiet because the
[3848.31s -> 3854.07s]  louder I am, there's a chance that I can wake up Shito and I don't want to do that. He's been
[3854.07s -> 3865.45s]  having a really relaxing day. No more running. I thought so. Good luck. Good luck. So let's go.
[3866.44s -> 3871.24s]  Utah is a five minute drive from Las Vegas. It is not a five minute drive.
[3874.73s -> 3882.57s]  It's five minutes. Your map ain't even correct. I, in fact, I take your map and I drive to the
[3882.57s -> 3890.71s]  place that you put on that location. I get lost. A fucking wolf like runs in front of the car
[3890.71s -> 3895.43s]  and like barks and I have to smear off the side of the road and I crash and I get it. I have no
[3895.43s -> 3902.63s]  cell phone reception. Like where the fuck am I? And like I call you and I go, hey man, uh, just
[3902.63s -> 3906.39s]  was, I'm curious. What's what this map you gave me? Is this even, how is this? I'm not, I don't think
[3906.39s -> 3912.26s]  I'm in Utah. And you hang the phone up. I'm still stuck in the fucking middle and I don't know where
[3912.26s -> 3921.58s]  I am. How can you stand living here? Isn't it hard to deal with this all the time? It's true. You
[3921.58s -> 3930.04s]  never really get used to it, but it keeps me sharp. That's a funny prank to be honest. God,
[3930.04s -> 3941.13s]  I, I like that. But the mountain is so confrontational. Streamer dies after listening
[3941.13s -> 3946.49s]  to a chat member. Sure. It doesn't beat around the bush. Celeste mountain is a place of healing.
[3947.29s -> 3958.63s]  So let's just stop talking. Stop. What do you mean stop? This is a live stream. Stop talking.
[3959.43s -> 3966.94s]  Oh, God damn it. I'm sorry. She don't, she don't. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
[3967.74s -> 3977.48s]  It's okay. It's like, it's okay. Yeah, it's okay. Back to sleep. Back to sleep.
[3979.43s -> 3995.37s]  Shit's okay. Yeah. Okay. Good boy. I'm sorry. See what I'm fucking saying? Stop them.
[3996.41s -> 4004.97s]  Wouldn't have fucking happened if I wasn't talking about this fucking car thing. Celeste mountain is a
[4004.97s -> 4009.82s]  place of healing, dear. The first step of healing is confirming the problem.
[4011.58s -> 4028.28s]  It's never easy. Tell me about it. What is Cheeto? No, it's Cheeto. Cheeto is my
[4029.88s -> 4051.00s]  actually alive automaton, near automata friend. What the hell? I guess I'm just going to walk
[4051.00s -> 4073.16s]  into this. What's next? All right. We've got to walk. Wait, secret. Oh shit. Oh, wait.
[4075.16s -> 4082.74s]  Come on. I think I'm just going to go down. There are no more secrets.
[4082.74s -> 4124.97s]  Ah, there are no more secrets. Are you sure about that? Oh, where am I fucking going? Wait a minute.
[4137.34s -> 4146.70s]  No, I have to think maybe if you didn't touch anything, maybe it would just go all the way
[4146.70s -> 4180.63s]  down to the fucking thing. I can't do the speed strategy to go that way. Oh, fuck. Okay. It's
[4180.63s -> 4202.84s]  right, left, right. Where are my berries? I didn't even say it right. Sorry. Nothing over there.
[4205.64s -> 4213.21s]  That feeling that face when you will never be the one guy. Sure about that. Where am I?
[4213.21s -> 4231.98s]  No, this is just battle toads. No, it's not.
[4245.24s -> 4259.98s]  How much further do I have to go? Let's do it again. I'm just kidding. Jump. Uh-oh, found you
[4259.98s -> 4267.11s]  looking for me. I thought you were done with me. That was a mistake. I'm sorry. You think you've
[4267.11s -> 4274.01s]  got it all figured out? You think you don't need me? I said, I'm sorry. We need to move
[4274.01s -> 4283.80s]  past this. You expect me to trust you? You aren't innocent here either, but I know you're scared.
[4284.89s -> 4292.14s]  Look, we're at rock bottom. There's no point in fighting. I can keep digging. I could pull us
[4292.14s -> 4300.22s]  down to the center of the earth. What would be the point? Let's climb out of here together.
[4302.71s -> 4334.66s]  Come close to me and I'll make you regret it. Do I have to just bop you again? Okay,
[4334.66s -> 4348.62s]  so it's just a question of... I hit you. I just have to touch you. Watch out for the falling cubes.
[4349.18s -> 4359.69s]  Nowhere to go except down. There you go. Laser? All right, so there's like a half second on it.
[4384.41s -> 4390.81s]  Where have I heard that sound before? I swear to God, I've heard this sound somewhere.
[4392.04s -> 4435.29s]  I'm like a Super Nintendo game. No! Xbox controller? Why have you given me a wrong
[4435.29s -> 4481.35s]  treasure map? Where'd the platform go? Oh, shut up. Not you guys. I'm talking about...
[4499.34s -> 4519.72s]  Oh, you had to do the little ball there. Come on. Damn it. I'm stupid. I had it. Keep overcompensating.
[4520.44s -> 4551.02s]  Look at the balls. Balls. How much further are you gonna go? I can make that without it.
[4551.02s -> 4584.90s]  Without using it. No, I can't. Oh, that's a big turn. Okay, I gotta start that way earlier.
[4585.70s -> 4635.18s]  This is a long string of events. Oh, shit. I didn't even see the fucking spikes. Oh, fuck.
[4635.18s -> 4648.36s]  I'm so used to this. That's the end right there. I got it. What are you doing? Stop. Just jump over
[4648.36s -> 4703.29s]  normally. Oh, don't... I don't want to wake him up. What the... Kaizo block. I did you a favor.
[4703.29s -> 4717.03s]  You aren't a mountain climber. I'm just trying to help you. None of this would have happened
[4717.03s -> 4740.42s]  if you had just listened to me. We're still going. We're still going. Oh, probably should have jumped.
[4741.06s -> 4793.90s]  I got it. Okay, we're fine. Stupid spike was there. Stupid jelly spikes. Oh, my God. They're up too
[4793.90s -> 4802.76s]  high. Delete those. Literally the stationary fucking object is the thing that causes so many
[4802.76s -> 4821.02s]  problems. Oh, my God. The Xbox controller. I'm going to beat it up. This thing sucks, though.
[4821.02s -> 4824.62s]  I'm gonna be real honest. I was supposed to get the other controller set up. I just didn't do it.
[4825.58s -> 4877.42s]  No. Oh, god damn it. Why? I just let it happen. God. Just slowing the game down. When you gotta
[4877.42s -> 4930.70s]  like... I need to go fast. You got me right at the end. Right at the end, you got me. I did it again.
[4930.70s -> 4941.93s]  I just have to... I don't have to dash. Oh, my God. Him would be done with this sequence already.
[4948.50s -> 4970.95s]  Oh, my fucking Jesus. No. Oh, what the fuck? God. You gotta launch off of it.
[4979.98s -> 4986.39s]  What the fuck? I always follow you down. Oh, all right. You always follow the direction that she
[4986.39s -> 4995.22s]  goes. She like goes down or goes right, and this time it's just spikes. That's the first time that
[4995.22s -> 5008.84s]  you've gone in the same direction where you couldn't go. My fucking Jesus. There's even more of this
[5008.84s -> 5017.77s]  shit. It doesn't end. I feel like I'm gonna dream. Maybe that's intentional.
[5037.61s -> 5062.81s]  No, wait. What do I do? I got you. I did it. I win. I win the game. That was fun. Fine. You win.
[5064.33s -> 5070.82s]  I guess you don't need me after all. If you don't want me to go away, I'll try.
[5071.94s -> 5076.81s]  That's not what I want. I need your help more than ever. Please, let's work together.
[5079.66s -> 5123.58s]  Work together. You're joking, right? It's okay to be scared. A selfie? I leveled up. What does that
[5123.58s -> 5131.27s]  mean? I can dash. I can dash twice now. They gave me the double jump that I so wanted so badly.
[5132.15s -> 5140.89s]  Perfectly balanced. Like all things should be.
[5157.26s -> 5168.92s]  Just testing it out. Now try to climb the mountain one more time.
[5169.88s -> 5188.47s]  Okay. Wait, I thought. Oh, how did we do that? If we can climb like that, maybe we can still
[5188.47s -> 5192.31s]  reach the summit. Before dinner. That's what you should have said. You still want to climb
[5192.31s -> 5201.18s]  the mountain. Why would we go back up there? It's good to see you two playing nice. Hey,
[5201.18s -> 5206.62s]  thanks for talking some sense into me earlier. Well, that's because I'm you from the future.
[5207.50s -> 5216.39s]  Glad I can still be useful every now and then. John? John, you're okay.
[5217.83s -> 5226.34s]  I ran down to help, but it looks like you're doing fine. Thanks, Theo. Honestly, maybe that
[5226.34s -> 5233.06s]  fall was what I needed. Is this the part of you that you were talking about? She's like
[5233.06s -> 5243.51s]  an adorable goth John. Hi. You were right, Theo. I shouldn't be afraid of her.
[5245.10s -> 5253.75s]  Haha, goth John. If her and I work together, I think we could still finish the climb.
[5254.31s -> 5266.31s]  That's so rad. Wait, no, I didn't agree to this. You said we talk about things first. You're right.
[5266.31s -> 5269.67s]  I understand that you're scared, but we both know that this is something we want to do.
[5270.31s -> 5278.12s]  We have to try one last time. That was the worst character. I don't know. We were so close and then
[5278.12s -> 5292.76s]  we fell. The mountain aka the forest tore us apart. Yeah, that happened, but I have to believe we can
[5292.76s -> 5304.22s]  put that behind us. I have to believe we're capable of this. It's not a bad idea. It'll still be
[5304.22s -> 5308.46s]  difficult, mind you, but I'm amazed you got as far as you did butting heads like you were.
[5309.42s -> 5316.84s]  I reckon you can make it if you cooperate, but please add me too and get a triple jump.
[5317.48s -> 5334.18s]  Can I help? You already done so much for me. Let me hold you back at least. This won't take long.
[5334.74s -> 5358.54s]  We're gonna get the rock music theme of the main theme on the last level. Less than 100.
[5358.54s -> 5368.33s]  And I got a B-Solid. This is the top. I made it to the top of the mountain.
[5369.29s -> 5386.49s]  But all will be revealed. That. Actually, I think I see where they're going here. We'll find out.
[5386.49s -> 5398.54s]  The summit. Here it comes. I'm gonna go.
[5404.30s -> 5416.30s]  Here comes the electric guitar. Watch. Come on. Do it. Here it comes. Here it comes. Do it.
[5416.30s -> 5452.98s]  It's building so much. It's a piano. It's not an electric guitar. Wait. What am I doing?
[5453.86s -> 5496.09s]  I was hoping for like a... No. No. Wait. Hold on. Secret?
[5517.50s -> 5537.58s]  No. No, that's it. That's gonna... I got it. I got it. I got it. I had it the first fucking
[5537.58s -> 5561.62s]  time. I had it the first goddamn time. I had it. I just had to go left once. I did it. So I need
[5561.62s -> 5569.83s]  to get that in a second here. Okay, I get it. To go left. Up left. If the Xbox controller
[5570.55s -> 5578.22s]  wasn't the worst human invention. I mean, we're talking about like number one worst
[5578.22s -> 5618.47s]  invention ever in the history of humanity. I mean, this is worse than the coffee maker.
[5618.87s -> 5634.89s]  Pretty bad invention. Whoa, wait. I thought we'd fly up. Things get clogged in like fucking two
[5634.89s -> 5639.78s]  months. Everyone's like, what are you talking about? Coffee maker. Use a coffee maker for a month.
[5639.78s -> 5645.46s]  And then guess what? You gotta fucking put vinegar in a damn thing. Do you not change the filter?
[5645.46s -> 5663.32s]  That's in the instructional booklet. We're getting the hang of it. You say so. I missed a secret.
[5663.32s -> 5678.12s]  And well, sometimes you get secrets missed. Stop jinxing it. Yeah, I'm talking about the clean...
[5678.28s -> 5686.98s]  Yeah, I'm talking about the clean. You don't know. I'm not talking about you put vinegar
[5687.86s -> 5694.41s]  in the coffee maker to make coffee. I'm talking about when you clean it. What?
[5699.16s -> 5707.86s]  And then the coffee for the rest of all time tastes just awful. Like salad dressing. Your coffee
[5707.86s -> 5717.45s]  tastes like salad dressing after you clean it. I need to look at this. Why would you do that?
[5717.93s -> 5725.34s]  Hey, I would like everybody in the chat right now to type in coffee maker cleaning clean
[5725.34s -> 5756.87s]  cycle vinegar. That's how that's it is in the instructional manual. Do it. Oh, I'm telling
[5756.87s -> 5764.07s]  everybody that you drink vinegar coffee. Don't you dare do that. Oh, no, you did. This looks
[5764.07s -> 5769.26s]  kind of elaborate. So let me see. Jump up. Let's just go for it. Forget it.
[5769.82s -> 5784.38s]  Okay. Well, whoops.
[5786.78s -> 5795.21s]  I guess I could go this way. Wait, do I miss out on something by not going that way?
[5796.57s -> 5801.85s]  What's the point of going up there? Secret or something? I guess I'll try it.
[5802.65s -> 5819.30s]  French press is a thing. I'm just, I'm just talking nonsense. Don't worry about it.
[5820.58s -> 5830.79s]  All right, I gotta pay attention. Time to pay attention. Back to pee too. Has it been two
[5830.79s -> 5843.37s]  hours? Because that's when I go to the bathroom every single time. No, wrong thing. I don't know.
[5843.37s -> 5849.21s]  Okay. I swear to God, there's something wrong with my body. I absolutely have to be. I have to pee
[5849.21s -> 5863.02s]  every two hours. Is something wrong with me? Are you doctors in here? Seriously? Is it drinking
[5863.02s -> 5874.89s]  too much vinegar? Damn it. Just trying to jump over it. Why won't it activate now? Like, activate.
[5874.89s -> 5883.35s]  What the hell are you doing? I'm going to scream. This is not even necessary. Just have to activate
[5883.35s -> 5897.94s]  the thing and then jump over it like that. Oh my God. Good diagonal jump. Xbox. He's starting.
[5898.98s -> 5904.39s]  I'm getting mad at circumstantial things. Not in the game. There's nothing to do in the game.
[5905.11s -> 5966.94s]  You guys are kidding me. Let's take a look. Here's the secret berry. Sick. Ah, sick. No,
[5966.94s -> 5975.96s]  that's not right. Am I beach ready? Probably not. No, definitely not.
[5976.52s -> 5997.34s]  Why are you asking me that question? I couldn't just grab the edge. Shit. I'm never going to have
[5997.34s -> 6004.26s]  a beach ready body. Is it like a thing? Is it a meme or something? No. What did I say it out loud?
[6006.50s -> 6024.22s]  I'm insane. Oh my God. I gotta pee. I didn't even get the damn thing. What?
[6024.22s -> 6029.51s]  Jeremy, what are you thinking? Why are you doing this? Oh, I'm going to say something disgusting
[6029.51s -> 6046.06s]  in a second if I'm not careful. Huh? Huh? I'm going to say it like pee. I'm going to say
[6046.06s -> 6051.13s]  something horrible about piss. I was going to be like, I don't even care. I'm going to pee right
[6051.13s -> 6069.06s]  into the ground. I was going to say something fucked up like that. Uh oh. I threw that without
[6069.06s -> 6101.99s]  dashing, can't I? Clappy bird. No pee until victory. I already made that video. Oh, well,
[6101.99s -> 6137.18s]  that works too. Doesn't it? Cool. Shit. Hydrant. How much time is left on the piss timer?
[6139.27s -> 6146.87s]  Uh, well, it's almost been two hours. So give or take 15 minutes. That's why I gravitated
[6146.87s -> 6153.29s]  towards the hydrant probably. You're right. How are you feeling? I'm just waiting for something
[6153.29s -> 6159.10s]  to go wrong. What's going on? What? We're getting a lot of time outs here. What are you guys
[6159.10s -> 6168.62s]  misbehaving? No matter what happens, I'll be right here with you. You know what's really scary? I'm
[6168.62s -> 6218.15s]  starting to believe you. 1,000 meters. Oh, ding dong. First try. Didn't even know I was
[6218.15s -> 6238.46s]  supposed to go this way. I keep thinking that song is my doorbell. I just go through twice.
[6239.10s -> 6247.93s]  Just go through twice. Making this harder on myself than I need to. That was easy. Oh shit.
[6248.81s -> 6280.10s]  Nice job Xbox. I wanted to go up. Relax. Relax. I don't know what to do. I know what to do.
[6308.12s -> 6329.27s]  Perfect. We're going too fast. Probably already missed a ton of shit. Nope. Nope. Can I stand on
[6329.27s -> 6371.72s]  something? No. What am I doing? No. Your shitty crusty muscle memory is not this way. Go the other
[6371.72s -> 6410.28s]  way. The way you were going before. I'll give it a shot. I've got the right to do. We've got to go
[6410.28s -> 6454.65s]  down. Complete the game with a rock band guitar. Sorry to disappoint you. I'm not sure it would be
[6454.65s -> 6472.47s]  possible for me to rock band this. Secret. That's the proof right there that the rock band controller
[6472.47s -> 6493.08s]  is not fucking very good. Saw that. Watch it happen. Nice job back there. Complaining about
[6493.08s -> 6496.84s]  the controller. All right. I'm going to stop. I'm going to stop complaining about the controller
[6496.84s -> 6500.92s]  because at the end of the day I'm the one that's operating. I'm the one that's driving the car.
[6500.92s -> 6507.29s]  So you know what I mean? Get a different steering wheel. Rip it out. Just get a screwdriver. Take
[6507.29s -> 6518.25s]  it out and just order one from Amazon and put it back in. Ms. Positivity over here. You're so
[6518.25s -> 6534.95s]  supportive. Don't push your luck. 1500 meters. No, I can get that straw. 10 minutes till I'm
[6534.95s -> 6544.81s]  going to pee my pants. And what are you thinking? You could have waited. You could have grabbed the
[6544.81s -> 6562.63s]  ledge. Why do I keep forgetting that's a possibility? Too much meat boy. I'm telling you. The piss is
[6562.63s -> 6579.13s]  causing this. Just got like electrocuted. Every muscle in my body just went like
[6592.82s -> 6595.94s]  I'm just trying to go too fast that you can't do that in this game.
[6596.50s -> 6632.22s]  You have to just do it when it's right. Not about who's operating it. It's having a bad car. I hate
[6632.22s -> 6653.30s]  this car. I hate. Oh stop. Have we found have we found the one strawberry in the game that's going
[6653.30s -> 6659.06s]  to make me like rage quit the whole game? And it's the it's arguably the easiest one in the entire
[6659.06s -> 6742.82s]  game in the whole game. Well, that's not correct. How do I get that one? I hate this shit. I hate
[6742.82s -> 6748.50s]  the like fucking moving little thumb things. I just want I don't want to do this one. Somebody
[6748.50s -> 6772.04s]  else do it for me. Not making it work. I gotta wait. In fact, tried to go up to the right. I
[6772.04s -> 6784.38s]  tried as hard as I could and I tried it again. Oh my god. I swear to you. I swear to you. I'm
[6784.38s -> 6789.50s]  about to go rip this fucking thing out and put in a fucking regular Nintendo controller for all I
[6789.50s -> 6852.15s]  care. What? No. That's what you guys do. No Jeremy. I just had to jump but I forgot it's over there.
[6858.81s -> 6859.61s]  It's all right. I'm fine.
[6859.61s -> 6886.46s]  Okay.
[6897.59s -> 6913.19s]  So I jump around and dash. Wait, I can stand on this. I'm thinking what am I thinking here?
[6913.19s -> 6935.58s]  That's what I'm thinking. Oh my god. I had it. I was at the end. That was the very end. We got
[6935.58s -> 6943.18s]  to deal with all these dumb things in this dumb world. That's dumb thing. I can't wait.
[6943.18s -> 6947.74s]  It's dumb worlds. Dumb stuff. Dumb. Everything's dumb. Nothing is smart. Everything's dumb. I'm
[6947.74s -> 6978.26s]  the smart one. Nothing. I'm the one that's smart. Please. You're gonna come up right there. This
[6978.26s -> 6989.94s]  stupid Mario fireballs. I had it the first time. Stupid fucking. I hate these things. I hate this
[6989.94s -> 7032.86s]  car. I love the road. It's a beautiful road that I'm on. I had it. Oh, I gotta pee in one minute.
[7033.50s -> 7042.84s]  I gotta complete the whole game in a minute. I see a secret over there.
[7043.48s -> 7055.66s]  The fact that those stupid, the thing grow. You can't stand on these for more than a second.
[7055.66s -> 7068.36s]  So how do you time? Again. I have to sit here and go at the right time, which is right,
[7068.36s -> 7100.81s]  which is right now. It would have been right now. And that would have been right now. Secret.
[7100.81s -> 7126.18s]  That's a diamond. What does it do? What does it do? I guess I got it apparently. More diamonds.
[7131.02s -> 7145.85s]  Holy shit. I almost just fell off the whole world. Okay, we're fine. Over here.
[7172.68s -> 7209.66s]  Whoops. Can I get that to move? I always feel like that should, not should, but my brain,
[7209.66s -> 7213.42s]  because I see the little beam go all the way up and I feel like I'm going up there too.
[7217.46s -> 7222.82s]  Check your pants. Why would I check my pants? Oh God. What happened?
[7222.82s -> 7230.36s]  This pee all over me. What happened? It's two hours in one minute. God damn it. You gotta be
[7230.36s -> 7237.94s]  kidding me. Pee'd my fucking pants. It was supposed to be two hours. All right. I'll be right back.
[7238.50s -> 7433.48s]  Hey guys. Let's get back to it. What do you say? Go. I got two jumps. And then this. Where do you
[7433.48s -> 7446.94s]  go from here? Ah, I see. All right. She goes all the way to the right. I really thought I made it
[7446.94s -> 7472.49s]  past. I pissed his pants. Oh, it's all right. I got plenty of pants. Damn it. Rich streamer.
[7472.49s -> 7475.29s]  Look at that. I didn't tell you how cheap the pants were.
[7487.94s -> 7493.06s]  No, I could say, guys, I eat out every day. You don't know what restaurant I'm talking about.
[7493.78s -> 7498.47s]  I could eat McDonald's every day and I would still be eating out every night.
[7514.17s -> 7522.52s]  I hope Mr. Ushiro is okay. Why? He treated you like garbage. Yeah, but I still care about it.
[7522.52s -> 7531.02s]  And you didn't have to. Whatever. I mean it. You're way too aggressive.
[7533.21s -> 7536.89s]  Well, you put too much energy into bad people who will just end up hurting you.
[7537.85s -> 7545.26s]  Mr. Ushiro isn't a bad person. He transformed into a monster. He tried to hurt you and now you're
[7545.26s -> 7557.14s]  defending him. I'm not defending him. Uh, 10 community subs from Furt Fernandez. Thank you.
[7557.14s -> 7567.74s]  That's a lot. 10. 10 community subs. And people that just got the community subs. Let's see some
[7567.74s -> 7581.58s]  fucking German boomer in the chat, please. I didn't name it that because that I don't want
[7581.58s -> 7588.94s]  people to know it's that name. It's just German old. That's not even a meme. That's not even like
[7588.94s -> 7595.13s]  a channel meme. We didn't come up with that. Somebody else did. I'm on your side here. I'm
[7595.13s -> 7600.49s]  mad too. I might still be in that hotel if you hadn't forced the issue, but I still hope he's
[7600.49s -> 7614.50s]  all right. I'm sorry for snapping at Mr. Ushiro. Thanks. It's in the past now. 2000.
[7624.55s -> 7633.77s]  Secret. Whatever. Mr. It's probably a secret over here. How would this be here? Bubble? No.
[7651.14s -> 7687.00s]  Oh shit. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Secret, right? Up, up, down, down. Not right. From there. I think I have to
[7687.00s -> 7721.46s]  fall, cross, hop. No. You have to fall. I mean, like you gotta really, you go across, you gotta
[7721.46s -> 7741.13s]  go across and then up and then jump, jump, jump. Question is how can you do that on the other side?
[7745.05s -> 7754.44s]  Close. You're really close. Close. You're really close. Is that what you guys are doing right now?
[7755.32s -> 7761.70s]  That's it. I thought you guys are telling me that I was really close, but you're just doing
[7761.70s -> 7796.42s]  the really close thing. Oh, I'm so far. Ah, my guess. Do the jump correctly. One thing I'm doing
[7796.42s -> 7803.66s]  wrong. Just don't know what it is. That's it. I got it. That's it. That's going to be the one.
[7803.66s -> 7835.48s]  That's it. Watch this. You're going to fall. Oh, that was so close. That was so close. I'm
[7835.48s -> 7845.85s]  going to be stuck here for a while. Just trying to do this one dumb jump. And there it is,
[7845.85s -> 7869.06s]  ladies and gentlemen. There it is. He got it. Got the secret gem. No, I did. No, I did, actually.
[7869.06s -> 7883.66s]  I did. I did. Just came from above. Jeremy, what are you talking about? No, me? No, me.
[7884.38s -> 7928.36s]  Are you serious? No, I did that. It was me. How was Utah? It was pretty nice. I'm wrong. It was me,
[7928.36s -> 7970.79s]  actually. Don't test my patience. I can't see. So back into the bubble. No, I don't understand.
[7971.59s -> 7995.56s]  What? Oh, no, I got to go forward. Oh, my God. It doesn't matter how many times you press the
[7995.56s -> 7998.60s]  button. It doesn't matter how many times you complain about it. You either got to fix it
[7998.60s -> 8029.67s]  or just deal with it. And that's the last straw. I was trying to go right twice. Mad because glad.
[8029.67s -> 8047.10s]  Mad because bad. Mad because sad. Sad because bad. Sad because mad. Mad because glad. Oh, shit.
[8047.10s -> 8060.14s]  Perfect timing, really. This bullet bill motherfucker over here. I'm going to be
[8060.14s -> 8066.15s]  done. Mad because bad. Mad because bad. Mad because bad. Mad because bad. Mad because bad.
[8067.11s -> 8082.76s]  What happened? That wasn't snow. That was spikes. I thought it was snow. Mad because bad. Mad because
[8082.76s -> 8126.44s]  bad. Mad because bad. Mad because bad. Holy shit. Grab the edge. Stop laughing and beat the level.
[8126.44s -> 8133.96s]  I just did something incredible and I spent the time laughing instead of doing the thing I was
[8133.96s -> 8149.88s]  supposed to do. You got to be kidding me. I was taunting the game. You know, I'm just not so sure
[8149.88s -> 8169.34s]  what I got to just jump. GG, idiot. Mad because bad. Bad at the game. Bad at the game. Bad at the
[8169.34s -> 8186.95s]  game. Bad at the game. I am trying to pull it to the left. Apparently not. I don't even need this
[8186.95s -> 8195.38s]  dumb thing. For what? That thing is just not going to work. Oh, that's why I need it. How do I do
[8195.38s -> 8249.86s]  that? What? What? I can't move it? Can I? I can't turn it or anything. I have to bring that other
[8249.86s -> 8263.29s]  one. I could drag this thing across the whole damn level. I'm trying. I tried to jump off of it and
[8263.29s -> 8281.74s]  wouldn't let me go. Let me go. Oh my god. Get it. Okay. I understand. That's a wall. It can go
[8281.74s -> 8301.50s]  through that. Jeremy, what happened to you? I'm fine. Bad because bad. Bad because bad.
[8302.14s -> 8330.55s]  Fuck the berry. Oh, I'm sorry guys. Sometimes you have to take a, uh, you can't get them all
[8330.55s -> 8368.17s]  the first time. I can get that one though, can't I? No dashing. Come here. Because you're bad.
[8369.05s -> 8392.22s]  Got it. Nobody can say that ever again. I like this. This is a good song. Some reason I thought
[8392.22s -> 8421.59s]  there was a secret. I think of the secrets. I saw the berry and it threw me up. Bingo. There's a
[8421.59s -> 8431.14s]  secret back here. I know there is. Too late. You gonna start me on the other side? No. Too late.
[8431.94s -> 8492.30s]  Uh oh. What are we thinking here? What are we thinking here? It was a close one. Yeah,
[8492.30s -> 8496.89s]  I wasn't sure if we'd make it. Maybe you were right. Maybe this is too dangerous.
[8499.85s -> 8507.85s]  I was wrong. We can climb this mountain. I got you back. And I believe in you.
[8509.48s -> 8519.18s]  That means a lot to me. Mad because bad. Bad because sad. Sad because glad. Glad because good.
[8519.18s -> 8525.85s]  Good because glad. Thrilled because skilled. That's the end. Yep, you guys got it right.
[8533.51s -> 8540.31s]  No, not so fast. Wait, wait, wait. What's over here? Anything? Nothing at all?
[8540.95s -> 8554.60s]  Don't count that as a death if you do, then I will be very upset about it. It's that easy.
[8562.81s -> 8570.52s]  Well, that's... I lean into the microphone. I don't know why. It's almost like I'm trying
[8570.52s -> 8587.56s]  to make sure you guys are aware of how... What am I doing? We gotta go. Okay, I think... Let me
[8587.56s -> 8604.63s]  think here. It seems like right from the edge maybe? Maybe. I just grabbed on.
[8611.86s -> 8632.70s]  What if I start from back here? That's it. I got it. Stop. What are you doing? Please, Xbox.
[8635.61s -> 8687.74s]  All right. Shit. I'm looking over a chat and I'm seeing... I'm seeing things that I don't know
[8689.42s -> 8712.84s]  and I'm looking at it again. I got the treasure map. Look, okay. Let me show this one more time.
[8712.84s -> 8717.00s]  I can do it my dumb way, but how am I supposed to know there's a bubble over here?
[8717.88s -> 8745.98s]  You know what I mean? This is like... I'm cheating. All right. Okay, okay. I did it right.
[8746.78s -> 8768.34s]  What have I grabbed from here? Holy shit. I thought I had it. I got the first part of this right.
[8769.06s -> 8786.23s]  Not the second part. Okay, now I get it. I'm gonna jump. You just jump, you don't dash.
[8788.70s -> 8792.22s]  I almost read it. I almost said it. You almost got me to say the word that I don't want to say.
[8793.02s -> 8814.39s]  Fuck you, Xbox. Shit. No. No. See, look, I did it. Look, I did the thing that everyone told me to do.
[8817.86s -> 8838.54s]  I did the thing. The thing I did not know existed and now I skipped the whole level. Cheater. Okay,
[8838.54s -> 8845.19s]  is it cheating if everybody screams at you to cheat? I guess it is still cheating, isn't it?
[8854.98s -> 8860.66s]  One guy? No fucking way. Not in a trillion years was that one guy. That was like 200 guys.
[8861.46s -> 8867.45s]  I don't have enough juice. That was more than that. That was probably four. That was a thousand
[8867.45s -> 8894.60s]  people. I gotta stop using those jumps. I'm gonna pull this fucking animal out of the pliers.
[8907.37s -> 8942.52s]  Another berry and a key. I think I have to go down. Hold on. I need to go up here first.
[8943.56s -> 8949.00s]  What's on the right side? I gotta go like this.
[8949.00s -> 8962.26s]  No, I don't have to go like that. I believe these are gonna open eventually.
[8963.46s -> 8996.31s]  It's a key. What's the counting for? What are you guys counting for right now?
[9007.85s -> 9020.42s]  Fuck. You guys ain't sick of that yet. What's the meme? How long does it take? Like seven years
[9020.42s -> 9026.79s]  for a meme to go away? Eight years? Like a decade? What's the meme? When is a meme no longer a meme?
[9026.79s -> 9048.81s]  After like 10 years? I'm gonna hug the left wall. Wow. I'm kind of freaking out right now.
[9048.81s -> 9071.54s]  That blew me off. I got it. That's it. So now I got the key to the door. Let's open the door.
[9072.42s -> 9083.16s]  Wait. Not yet. That's it. Anything else at the bottom here? Nothing. Hey Sonny, what's a pogchamp?
[9084.04s -> 9090.28s]  Well, grandpa. Pogchamp is when something is cool on the screen and you thought it was really like
[9090.28s -> 9110.12s]  high quality. It's a way to say, hey, that was high quality. Interesting Xbox.
[9149.10s -> 9153.50s]  Input's not even happening anymore. It's like the controller is getting worse.
[9154.78s -> 9170.34s]  Design a new controller. Sure. Let me show you the ideal controller. This is what we should be using.
[9170.90s -> 9176.18s]  I'm going to go over all this bullshit right now because it needs to be done.
[9176.18s -> 9192.79s]  Give me a second. Is this going to be the urinal? No, it's not. It's going to take not even five
[9192.79s -> 9214.52s]  minutes. So let's design the perfect controller because, man, like really, is it really that hard?
[9214.52s -> 9229.46s]  Here you go. So here we go. Let's get the grip right. Best grip that was ever invented was
[9229.46s -> 9236.18s]  the Nintendo 64 grip. That gives you two different grips to work with. But I'm of the opinion,
[9236.18s -> 9243.51s]  right? So here you go. You got this here, which leads up to down here. A lot of space in between.
[9243.51s -> 9249.78s]  You see what I'm saying? So when you grab under here, you can wrap your hand around the whole
[9249.78s -> 9259.69s]  thing. Your fingers can wrap around. This comes up like here. There's your base of the controller.
[9259.69s -> 9268.39s]  The first analog is here. Perfect spot. And it's make it a little bit smaller, right? But have the
[9268.39s -> 9275.99s]  divots here so you can actually move it around and it doesn't get stuck anywhere. You know,
[9275.99s -> 9286.17s]  have it have a little well like a moat, right? So there's analog. Down here, two buttons. These
[9287.27s -> 9294.73s]  are your extra remappable buttons if you want to play it on PC. OK, because this, by the way,
[9294.73s -> 9299.13s]  this controller should work across all systems because this is the number is the main system
[9299.13s -> 9306.94s]  controller right in the middle. One huge button here because if you're holding with two hands,
[9306.94s -> 9312.70s]  you get your left hand here and your right hand here. Huge button. Big enough where you can.
[9312.70s -> 9319.66s]  You're not going to miss it. And that would be jump on most fucking computer games here,
[9320.38s -> 9329.13s]  here and here across the top. These are like L and R, right? So this is L1, L2,
[9329.13s -> 9334.55s]  R1, R2. All these can be mapped, by the way, just in case you're curious. Trigger over here,
[9334.55s -> 9340.09s]  trigger over here, trigger over here, trigger over here. So you got two triggers. This would be
[9340.09s -> 9360.10s]  L3, L4, L5, L6. I mean, R5, R6, right? Space not enough where you can know where they are.
[9360.18s -> 9380.36s]  This would be A, B, no, this would be A, B, C, D, E, G, H, I, J. OK, and the reason why this is like
[9380.36s -> 9388.78s]  this is because you've got analog here, big A button here, right analog right here. This is
[9388.78s -> 9397.19s]  the other analog. This controller, what you're looking at right now, can be held in any direction.
[9397.19s -> 9402.76s]  You can hold this and use EFG. See what I'm saying? You can have your hand down here.
[9403.32s -> 9409.38s]  EFG. If you're more comfortable with a higher grip, put another analog right here.
[9409.62s -> 9420.31s]  This is called the uniform every controller. Where's the D-pad? It's all about grip right now,
[9420.31s -> 9426.63s]  OK? Because you can hold it on an edge, like your fingers can come up here, around this way,
[9426.63s -> 9431.27s]  grab that way, or you can have your thumb here, and these can be mapped. So you could not even
[9431.27s -> 9435.19s]  use this controller, this part here, and use these, depending on how much you care about the grip.
[9435.19s -> 9461.14s]  OK, now let's make the real one. It's going to take way too long. Here you go.
[9461.14s -> 9472.84s]  Grips. Actual finger grips on the sides. Analog one. Analog two. Not too close together.
[9472.84s -> 9477.72s]  The PS4 has a problem here, where the analogs are here and here. They're way too close. You
[9477.72s -> 9487.06s]  can bump your thumbs together if you push them right and left. Button one. Button two. Button
[9487.06s -> 9502.20s]  three. Button four. Start. Select. Tray. That comes down. French fries. Hamburgers. Right? Food. A
[9502.20s -> 9527.66s]  drink. Here's your lap. This is your lap. L-R. French fries. Two plugs. One plug into the console.
[9527.66s -> 9543.19s]  Second plug for the lights in your house. Here's a lamp. It's too long to draw a controller.
[9543.19s -> 9547.42s]  The first one was a joke. The second one was gonna be real, but it was gonna take too long.
[9547.42s -> 9551.96s]  It would take too long to design a controller. I'm not even making a joke. I just like didn't
[9551.96s -> 9581.45s]  want to take that long to do it. It was a bar of soap. Ugh. Tray. That's such a tiny tray. But
[9581.77s -> 9587.91s]  what you don't realize is that controller was huge. That was like a fight stick. Oh my god.
[9587.91s -> 9601.62s]  Speaking of controllers, I'm about to fucking go make one. Where was the urinal? No, I can't just
[9601.62s -> 9622.82s]  sit there and draw for like 40 minutes. I mean, you can. Yeah, I can, but I'm so close to the end
[9622.82s -> 9628.65s]  of this game that why would I just spend like 30 minutes right now designing a fake controller?
[9629.53s -> 9682.50s]  I figured it out. Take me up. Thank you. No, it's not. The game's not stupid. Right here. Tray.
[9682.50s -> 9709.96s]  Right here. This urinal made it. Yes. Over. Up. Up. Over. Ha. Ha. That freaked me out.
[9712.50s -> 9716.18s]  It was the dumb thing with the... It looks like you fly up higher than you do.
[9716.82s -> 9754.06s]  I'm gonna figure this one out. Holy shit. What the... Xbox controller.
[9764.58s -> 9788.95s]  I couldn't even do that if I tried on purpose. It's fuming because booming.
[9789.59s -> 9794.92s]  Ah, all right. Come on. You're really reaching on that one.
[9797.06s -> 9809.35s]  Come on. That's not even a word. Again. Again. You can do it again. I shouldn't have done that.
[9811.40s -> 9854.63s]  Fuming. This is it. The home stretch. We're so close. We're gonna make it. What's wrong?
[9855.82s -> 9866.02s]  I'm just... I'm sorry. I was holding you back. I need to learn to trust you. You must learn.
[9866.74s -> 9872.10s]  It's not your fault. I tried to leave you behind. And honestly, I've been trying to leave you behind
[9872.10s -> 9878.20s]  my entire life. I'm sorry. I wish I tried to understand you sooner. I was too proud or stubborn
[9878.20s -> 9887.40s]  or something. You wasted so much time and energy. At least we're finally talking about it. The
[9887.40s -> 9897.40s]  controller I talked about is real. Thank you. How do I get this? How do I order this? Is this real?
[9898.36s -> 9912.36s]  That looks like somebody... I want that. Look at how beautiful that is. The front one.
[9913.16s -> 9926.73s]  The little like Xbox dick. You can use that for like flight games when you fly. That's not real.
[9926.73s -> 9942.20s]  Tony made that up for fun. I thought I just crashed the game. Thank God. I'm glad the mountain
[9942.20s -> 9948.84s]  brought you up. I think we can move past this. If we can climb this mountain together, we can do
[9948.84s -> 9958.62s]  anything. What if we don't make it? I'd be okay with that. You would? Of course. I'm just glad
[9958.62s -> 9963.59s]  we're trying. I really need to do this. I'm finally starting to understand why. Let's finish it.
[9964.31s -> 10015.06s]  Three thousand. Twenty-nine. Great. Twenty-eight. He's gonna start fucking counting.
[10015.78s -> 10020.66s]  And I can't stop this shit because it's in the game.
[10036.54s -> 10041.06s]  Still happening. I will never stop it.
[10042.92s -> 10083.05s]  Secret? No. No, it's fine. That's it. I have to get a hundred berries. I went through it. I went
[10083.13s -> 10098.09s]  through that when I collected it. It's been 16 years since what?
[10110.07s -> 10128.84s]  Fucker. I swear to God. Come on. Oh, I gotta grab the edge. That's what I'm doing wrong with that.
[10129.48s -> 10133.91s]  I'm not, you know, I'm just gonna say got flag because I'm not gonna say the numbers.
[10151.90s -> 10154.94s]  Ninety-seven. Ninety-eight. I need two more to get a hundred.
[10180.41s -> 10194.09s]  Are you putting flags in there? Wait, what? Is that a flag? No, it's number one. I can get it.
[10197.90s -> 10220.68s]  Boomer vision. Activate boomer vision. Really? Don't worry. When I'm, when I do the bionic boomer
[10220.68s -> 10228.58s]  thing, there will be a boomer vision. Holy shit. I got it. Okay. And I will activate it and you
[10228.58s -> 10241.26s]  will get to see through my eyes. One more and I get a hundred. It's gonna be spooky. Yeah.
[10244.01s -> 10271.53s]  Well, okay. I screwed that up. Oh, it's the wind. I get it. The wind is doing this.
[10290.46s -> 10298.86s]  I need another berry. That's going to drive me crazy if I actually don't find one.
[10299.66s -> 10335.03s]  There's one right there. Okay. We're good. Shit. A second here. Where is it? Maybe I'm, I think I
[10335.03s -> 10348.23s]  have to get up with charge. Do I? I think I can. All right. I got a checkpoint. So drop down.
[10354.95s -> 10397.86s]  One hundred. Berry. Go for a hundred and one. One jump. Reset it. Oh, it's because I'm at a,
[10397.86s -> 10409.24s]  I'm at a hundred and one. Reset it. No, you've ruined it. I'll get an even number.
[10410.04s -> 10426.50s]  We'll go, we'll get one, one, one. Nothing safe over there. All right. I think I got it.
[10431.45s -> 10445.85s]  Damn. This is two, is it two jumps? Hold on to the edge. Is this a pre-recorded stream?
[10445.85s -> 10476.10s]  Yes. I'm sorry. Good shit. All right. You got to do to all sides. Yeah. I'm recording this. It is
[10478.71s -> 10485.48s]  August 3rd, 2018. I knew I wasn't going to be able to stream this week, so
[10486.12s -> 10499.86s]  I made sure to get something up here. Oh shit. God, man. This is, this part sucks.
[10500.58s -> 10583.58s]  That one is stand on. Nobody said that? Yeah, they did. Yippee. Ow. My skull. It's only one.
[10583.58s -> 10637.38s]  It's one jump. That's it. A half second. So precise. God damn. Oh, you suck at Fortnite.
[10637.38s -> 10652.18s]  I hope so. If I was good at Fortnite, that'd be a real weird problem. That'd be strange.
[10655.40s -> 10688.58s]  He sucks at Fortnite. This, this may be the hardest jumps in the game. Also, by the way,
[10688.58s -> 10693.54s]  also keep in mind, half of these where I jump into the ceiling is because the, the nevermind.
[10693.54s -> 10707.83s]  I'm doing it wrong. Well, I wanted to go up. I want to jump up there. That would've been great.
[10709.54s -> 10719.13s]  Sorry. I have, I have just stopped. Oh, I hate this fucking thing. Can I like record myself
[10719.13s -> 10725.38s]  burning the Xbox one controller and like peeing on it? And am I going to get in trouble for that?
[10735.35s -> 10749.50s]  Legally? No. God damn it. Get me out of here. There's more. Oh, that sucks. Total ass. I can't,
[10749.50s -> 10766.65s]  I'm going to pee on this. I'm done. Not like getting, I'm talking about like that can't make
[10766.65s -> 10833.90s]  a jump. Dash left and then up. It sure is. Good. Give it here. Give it here. Six. Where do I go?
[10833.90s -> 10843.05s]  Where am I going? Up? It's always up. I got to get to the top of the mountain. Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh,
[10843.05s -> 10868.52s]  uh-oh. I got it. I wonder where we're supposed to go. Climb the mountain maybe. I guess it could
[10868.52s -> 10874.30s]  look. Every time I look, it doesn't really help me. All right. So you got to go up and around,
[10874.30s -> 10899.77s]  grab the feather and then go the wrong way. Oh my God. What are you supposed to do there?
[10901.88s -> 10917.61s]  Wow. You got to go around the edge. Holy shit. I would have loved to have gone straight up there.
[10918.17s -> 10962.63s]  I'm ripping it off. I don't think I can get it. Nope. Wait. I think I can get it. It's
[10962.63s -> 10975.19s]  going to take some precision on my part though. And who says you can't fucking get shit done?
[10975.91s -> 10991.54s]  I want to know their name. I want to know their name. Donnie? It was Donnie, wasn't it? Tell
[10991.54s -> 11017.24s]  Donnie. Bring him up. Dude, he did it. Two. Nope, that's not going to help. That is.
[11029.38s -> 11034.81s]  Don't call him yet. Don't call Donnie yet. Don't call Donnie because he's going to turn the stream
[11034.81s -> 11038.73s]  on. He's going to be like, fuck, you kidding me? No, he's not. He didn't do it. And he's going to
[11038.73s -> 11041.61s]  load the stream up and he's going to be falling. Shit. Don't call him yet. Call him in like 10
[11041.61s -> 11063.38s]  minutes. All right. Ready? Call him now. Get him in here. Hey, yeah. Dude, Jerma is about to beat
[11063.38s -> 11070.76s]  Celeste. Shut the fuck up, stupid. There's no way he's going to do that. Okay. Sure. I believe
[11070.76s -> 11075.16s]  you. Open the stream, dude. I'm not kidding. He's about to do it. Yeah. Hey, I'm not going to.
[11080.71s -> 11088.57s]  No way. No way. He probably cheated. He probably like, you know, I bet he has a safe state.
[11088.57s -> 11099.50s]  We actually did it. I can't believe it. I didn't have a safe state. Wow. It's so beautiful. Look
[11099.50s -> 11110.90s]  at how far we've come. Glad I got to see this before I, well, before I. Oh, right. When we
[11110.90s -> 11123.34s]  leave the mountain, you won't be able to talk to me anymore. I didn't. How did I cheat? Because I
[11123.34s -> 11136.06s]  got a secret item. At least not like this. Yeah. I know that we need to go home eventually, but it'll
[11136.06s -> 11145.80s]  be scary to lose his body. Beat because cheat. He'll still exist though. You were part of me
[11145.80s -> 11154.38s]  before we came up here. Yeah, I know. But I'm going to have to depend on you to listen to me,
[11154.38s -> 11159.26s]  even if I can't talk to you in person anymore. I just can't go back to how it was before,
[11159.26s -> 11165.10s]  before the mountain. Don't worry. I can't go back to that either. I really want us to work
[11165.10s -> 11178.62s]  together from now on. I believe you, but I'm still nervous. So now what? Let's just enjoy this for a
[11178.62s -> 11195.45s]  bit. Selfie. Here it comes. That was a video. You went into video mode on your DSLR. You don't
[11195.45s -> 11221.70s]  really take a selfie with the DSLR, do you? Did it. I climbed the mountain. We're not done though.
[11222.26s -> 11237.64s]  That was a lot of fun. Am I going back down? That was a challenging, fun platform game.
[11238.44s -> 11253.46s]  Washed up Fortnite streamer. Okay. If I was a Fortnite streamer, I wouldn't be washed up
[11253.46s -> 11257.06s]  because I would be doing the current trend that's currently relevant right now.
[11257.78s -> 11264.04s]  You don't get washed up as a Fortnite streamer when Fortnite is currently still the most popular
[11264.04s -> 11271.69s]  thing in the world. If I was streaming like Minecraft right now, or like Five Nights at
[11271.69s -> 11290.14s]  Freddy's, maybe that's not what washed up means. What will you? Okay. There's washed up and then
[11290.14s -> 11309.72s]  there's washed up X. I don't even need to explain myself. Did they ever explain who that guy was?
[11310.44s -> 11314.71s]  Because I understand the whole, some of the other characters here.
[11315.35s -> 11327.50s]  But who's that guy? I know he was like the hotel and he was a ghost. But in the story, in like the
[11327.50s -> 11339.67s]  deeper meaning of the story here, is it just the hotel manager? That's just who he was. He's just
[11339.67s -> 11360.44s]  a ghost. B-sides, Jax. Don't be a normie. Oh my god. I already did one B-sides. I'm gonna do it.
[11360.44s -> 11377.30s]  We're not done. I'm going to the B-sides. We're gonna try it. But who's the bird? I don't know why
[11378.02s -> 11385.45s]  I can't do that. I would ruin it. Oh, that would be very bad. I was just, I had this flash
[11386.17s -> 11393.78s]  moment in my brain where I was just watching myself on webcam. Cheeto wakes up in his
[11393.78s -> 11399.62s]  chirping and I go, I go like mush up food in my mouth and like on cam like spit it into his mouth,
[11400.66s -> 11409.80s]  like feeding him. I'm glad I didn't do that. I was glad that didn't happen.
[11410.52s -> 11417.03s]  Like I'm feeding the baby bird. Hey, welcome back.
[11420.33s -> 11424.01s]  But then I wouldn't, I can't ruin Cheeto. I can't like fuck up the toy.
[11424.98s -> 11434.33s]  Did you make it into the summit? Yeah, we did. It was incredible. Beautiful, isn't it? I didn't
[11434.33s -> 11440.14s]  think it would be worth it, but it totally was. I should have given you my phone so you could take
[11440.14s -> 11446.54s]  the ultimate selfie. I thought he was going to say YOLO again. Good evening, everyone.
[11447.26s -> 11452.22s]  What are you doing here? A little bird told me there was going to be a party.
[11454.92s -> 11460.20s]  RSVP by bird, positively magical. But if I am unwelcome, I shall take my leave.
[11461.72s -> 11473.75s]  Please stay, Mr. Oshiro. It's good to see you. You know, this is the first time I've seen you
[11473.75s -> 11480.31s]  outside that hotel of yours, Oshiro. I'm glad you made it. John here is baking us a pie with
[11480.31s -> 11485.59s]  all the strawberries she's been collecting. Oh, that's what the strawberries are. That's
[11485.59s -> 11491.83s]  wonderful. I haven't had strawberry pies since I was a kid. This is going to be amazing.
[11493.11s -> 11498.23s]  Don't get your hopes up. She's not much of a baker. He also said I wasn't a mountain climber.
[11500.02s -> 11507.78s]  True. I made 101 berries. I can't promise it'll live up to the hype, Theo, but I tried my best.
[11507.78s -> 11518.15s]  I'm impressed. Put them in. How's it taste? Sounds kind of looks like it's pretty good.
[11520.15s -> 11526.47s]  I'm impressed. This gives my baking a run for its money. Good ending. Not bad. Holy crap. This is
[11526.47s -> 11534.23s]  so tasty. John, are you available to cater our reopening banquet? I thought he was going to say,
[11534.23s -> 11544.95s]  can I take a selfie with it? Can I take a selfie with it? You already is taking a selfie with it,
[11544.95s -> 11552.49s]  though. So that already happened. That really is too bad. The numbers there are the way they are.
[11553.21s -> 11565.85s]  102 out of 175. 1373 deaths. Eight hours and 26 minutes. Almost elite status. Can we get more
[11565.85s -> 11579.91s]  likes than the Kardashians on this cake? There's the campaign. There's an epilogue, though. Wait,
[11580.55s -> 11585.61s]  what's this? It's been two hours? No, it's only been an hour and 15 minutes. Why do I have to pee
[11585.61s -> 11609.82s]  again? This is chapter eight, the core. About a year later. Hey there, kiddo. Nice to see you again.
[11611.18s -> 11630.20s]  Here's the cave I told you about on the phone. Follow me. What happened? I wasn't walking up.
[11630.20s -> 11642.60s]  Wait, what's going on here? Why don't I have power? Um, okay. Strange. What is this place? How do you
[11642.60s -> 11647.08s]  have the lady do this? That's right. This passage leads to the center of the mountain. You said you
[11647.08s -> 11653.48s]  wanted to come back and explore deeper. Doesn't get any deeper than this. Be careful, though.
[11654.28s -> 11657.72s]  When you get this close to the heart of the mountain, the power will start affecting
[11657.72s -> 11666.73s]  you differently. Yeah, I already noticed some of that. Good luck in there. Where's that other part
[11666.73s -> 11673.69s]  of you? I don't know. I expect her to show up by now. Maybe I've changed and she's not part of me
[11673.69s -> 11679.61s]  anymore. Or maybe you've grown together. Maybe it's not so easy for the mountain to separate you now.
[11679.61s -> 11686.23s]  I'd wager she's still with you in some form. I like that. Still wish I could talk to her, though.
[11686.79s -> 11707.94s]  All right, bye. I'm worthy. Oh, I am worthy to go through. How does this work? Oh, all right.
[11708.82s -> 11728.90s]  Oops. Oh, that was clean. Beat level in the whole game. Oh, best level in the game.
[11729.78s -> 11735.02s]  Okay, we'll see. It does have flying objects, so I don't know. I might not agree with you.
[11736.06s -> 11754.79s]  Well, that's what that does. Why I keep doing that? They don't talk. Well, that's why. Because I have
[11754.79s -> 11787.90s]  to do it in one jump because I ran out of juice. Don't get refilled. Hmm. Not entirely sure why
[11787.90s -> 11799.05s]  they've given that to me, but I'm sure there's a reason. Let's go down. Shouldn't be wasting
[11799.05s -> 11831.21s]  one there. Looks like it's still naked. Left and right. Let's see. I'm trying to get lucky.
[11832.17s -> 11854.94s]  All right, let's go left. So am I supposed to touch it or something somehow? Can't jump on them.
[11863.66s -> 11886.89s]  It's over here. I guess this looks kind of like where I need to be. So I gotta jump across from
[11886.89s -> 11935.14s]  ran out of power. Whoops. Ah. Wait, what? I think I'm doing it right, I think. He's abandoned the
[11935.14s -> 11943.35s]  solutions. What do you mean, abandoned the solutions? I can't use the dash here. Except
[11943.35s -> 11953.40s]  I did. But I can. What about up here? The critical information is not accessible to him.
[11954.12s -> 11984.36s]  Oh, I'm not in assist mode. Oh, there's a fire. Wait, now it's ice. So you go from fire to ice.
[11985.08s -> 12023.54s]  Jump on these? Yes, you can. Now what? Uh oh. Oh. Yes, who is it? Ah, okay. Now we go back
[12024.18s -> 12035.14s]  and everything's frozen. Would you look at that? Icy to dull the pain and then hot to relieve it
[12035.14s -> 12060.94s]  away. Icy hot. I see what you're doing over here. That was a good chat joke. Now I can go. Wait,
[12060.94s -> 12078.74s]  wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. This is now accessible. Washed up Fortnite streamer.
[12090.25s -> 12111.93s]  I need one more. I need to save one. That's how you do it. That is how you do it. You know what?
[12111.93s -> 12139.56s]  You're really starting to piss me off. You're really starting to piss me off. Don't you dare.
[12139.56s -> 12155.74s]  Don't do this. Why have you done this to me? Oh, I had it. I got you. I do the stupid bumper.
[12156.30s -> 12173.22s]  It's all right. Not this time. Okay. Now I can get up there. I think I need to
[12174.10s -> 12184.41s]  come at it from this angle. I gotta break them one by one, I think.
[12185.21s -> 12207.42s]  As they come around, maybe. I guess I could just go straight through the middle. There you go.
[12208.86s -> 12216.58s]  Now I can jump off of them. Oh, they respawn. I just go up. I don't, I don't need to destroy
[12216.58s -> 12263.74s]  them all for any reason. Just go up. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. I was right there with video game.
[12264.30s -> 12289.32s]  I didn't even want to grab. I wouldn't even hold and grab. I'm going to go from up here
[12289.32s -> 12294.65s]  and I'm going to drop down off the top rope. I think that's what I need to do.
[12303.61s -> 12316.52s]  Probably not. I think I do actually. Let me see. Yeah, I definitely do because then I have to dash.
[12317.32s -> 12358.34s]  Now I'll get up. I'm angling as hard as I can to the top right. I gotta pee too. Okay.
[12359.80s -> 12366.84s]  Now I got this. Oh, what the hell? I touched the stupid thing on the side. Oh, no. That's not good.
[12368.95s -> 12393.54s]  It's all right. Mad because bad. Mad because bad. Oh, dear. You gotta switch it halfway through.
[12394.50s -> 12422.79s]  Thanks. Okay. I don't even need to use that. Oh, no. Secret up there. Oh, well. Can't get it
[12422.79s -> 12460.07s]  anyways. Can I? How did I thread that needle? I waited so long. Oh, well. My fucking hands
[12460.07s -> 12483.56s]  are slipping with my greasy, fucking sweaty hands. I'm going to jump over on the second jump.
[12499.91s -> 12526.82s]  All right. He's got pee-coated hands. Shit. Oh, interesting stuff. So I'm going to hold and dash
[12526.82s -> 12541.70s]  here. Damn it. I blew it again. Why am I dashing there? I don't think it's even necessary.
[12542.42s -> 12572.38s]  Just die. I just panicked so hard. Nope, he's not going to do it. No, he's not.
[12583.96s -> 12601.03s]  Shit. That was right there. I had it. It was right there. Everything went so smooth. Xbox 360.
[12618.01s -> 12638.14s]  Oh, I swear to God. All right. Seriously, how come I can get that sometimes? The other half
[12638.14s -> 12653.90s]  of the time I can't do it. No, it's not. Oh, I'm trying to time it, but I just can't do it apparently.
[12663.96s -> 12674.41s]  Oh, fuck. You don't get it. If I don't get that first jump first try, I'm just falling down.
[12674.41s -> 12707.14s]  Seriously. I didn't even fucking need to do that. Holy fuck. What happened? Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[12707.14s -> 12728.84s]  I think I can use that. What the hell was that? Whoa. What? Holy shit. Timing on some of these.
[12729.56s -> 12774.06s]  It's like, come on, man. Okay. Hit the bottom right, pinball, jump out. No. Shit. What? I gotta
[12774.06s -> 12779.02s]  go pee before I spike this controller into the ground and have it shatter into 10,000 pieces
[12779.02s -> 12931.48s]  because that's how strong I am. Okay. Let's try this again. How much did you pay for a nude of
[12931.48s -> 12987.70s]  Jeremy? I'll give you one for free right now. Trying so very hard. Why? What do I do? What do
[12987.70s -> 12997.83s]  I do? Oh, hold on. Oh, stop. Stop moving. Everyone stop moving. Oh, shit. All right. How the fuck do
[12997.83s -> 13007.40s]  I reliably do this? The bottom right one is what everyone's screaming. But all right. So you're
[13007.40s -> 13021.82s]  talking about like on the way down, bounce off that. Okay. Oh my fuck. The stupid slow jump
[13021.82s -> 13026.86s]  over here. It's just, I can, I just, my God, I, I'm going to fucking get so angry at this.
[13027.90s -> 13049.05s]  It's like that, like wage up. I'm going to do that. I really don't even want to do that.
[13049.85s -> 13061.10s]  I don't care about the strawberry. Get me out of here. I hate that. That was the worst thing ever.
[13072.76s -> 13081.72s]  This is going to be, this is going to be hell. Oh, it's going to be hell.
[13092.86s -> 13121.70s]  Give me back. Get up. No. Strawberry? No. Fuck the strawberry. I'm not getting it. Oh, come on.
[13122.42s -> 13126.33s]  You got to put these stupid fucking pinball machines everywhere.
[13128.90s -> 13155.11s]  I had it too. Pain in the balls. Shit. I blew it. No, I didn't miss it. Go back and get it.
[13160.71s -> 13211.38s]  Wow. What the fuck happened? I did it. Wow. Oh, I'm going to go up. No, I thought I could just cheese
[13211.38s -> 13241.40s]  it. I just got to go fast. I can't just stop. I would have had it if I actually dashed right when
[13241.40s -> 13292.02s]  I pressed the button to do so. Sunk the hedgehog level. That's fine. Oh shit. Ice, ice, ice. Is that
[13292.02s -> 13362.94s]  going to hurt me? I actually might be able to go up. I already used it. Still going. Oh, what the
[13362.94s -> 13424.86s]  fire? No fire. I can't turn it off. I didn't know. Oh man. You got to be kidding me. No, I hate this
[13424.86s -> 13455.86s]  moving shit. I really do. I don't have any juice. I can't go anywhere. Oh, I can't do that. I need
[13455.86s -> 13484.58s]  you. Moving shit. Moving shit. Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Oh, wait just a
[13484.58s -> 13500.39s]  minute. Wait a minute. Oh. I got to start on this side. Oh no. That's how you do it. I can't do that.
[13501.03s -> 13511.56s]  Dude, just go from. They're just baiting me.
[13541.40s -> 13556.25s]  Fucking moving shit. Not every time. I am going to burn this on spring. I'm going to have a nice
[13556.33s -> 13590.86s]  fire in my backyard and we're going to burn this controller. Sometimes it does not. Nope.
[13591.74s -> 13615.93s]  That needs to be perfect. I think I need bulk dashes too. I'm not getting it right. I got to
[13615.93s -> 13645.34s]  jump off that into the wall and damn. Sometimes you just end up doing that. He's making it look
[13645.34s -> 13655.43s]  hard. It is hard. How is this not hard? You got to be like the fucking alien to not think this is
[13655.83s -> 13665.78s]  a difficult portion of the game. You're making this look hard. The bonus epilogue chapter.
[13666.50s -> 13684.15s]  That's way past the end of the game. In this hard platformer game. Good time. I got to get higher.
[13700.14s -> 13725.64s]  Holy fuck. I had it. No, that was it. Oh my God. No, don't do this to me. What if it happened?
[13725.64s -> 13753.18s]  What happened? Where'd it go? Where is it? No. I wouldn't have had it if I didn't dash. Oh my God.
[13754.14s -> 13786.25s]  No, don't do it. What do I do here? Oh my God. Get up there. No, no, no. Hit the ice. Wait. Wait.
[13786.25s -> 13819.13s]  I don't know what to do next. Oh, this is hard. I need a dash. I got to go. I have no idea what to
[13819.13s -> 13867.85s]  do there. Get that. That's how you do it. Oh man. Oh, come on. What did I even bump my head on? That
[13867.85s -> 13907.56s]  makes no sense. Oh yeah. Bump my head again. No, I can't climb that. I don't know what the hell
[13907.56s -> 13917.77s]  I was thinking. You beat the levels. This is getting repetitive. I know you guys are just
[13917.77s -> 13931.50s]  joking around. I know you are. There's no way this is not a joke. You have to be kidding. Okay,
[13931.50s -> 13956.06s]  here we go. Dude, how the fuck was I ever supposed to do that? Touch it. I win. He can't be this bad,
[13956.06s -> 13963.10s]  can he? There's no way he's this bad. How can he be this bad? He's bad. Bad. Bad.
[13997.30s -> 14013.32s]  Give you a second and I'm out of it. I'm out of it. Oh no. Shit. It's gonna. Oh my God.
[14016.52s -> 14027.13s]  One of those hard ones. Jerma, come home. You've been playing this game for months.
[14028.01s -> 14057.40s]  No, it's on this screen. Oh boy. Oh boy. That was not too bad. Not terrible. It's gonna get
[14057.40s -> 14064.47s]  way worse though. I think I understand. I gotta just bounce across the whole thing.
[14089.75s -> 14093.27s]  That blended in with the background. That was a shadow. That shadow blended in.
[14094.23s -> 14125.64s]  Oh no. Wait, that's not. I need to. We already climbed the mountain. We're in the heart of the
[14125.64s -> 14140.06s]  mountain now. This is the epilogue level. The bonus chapter. And I have to. I have to beat this
[14140.06s -> 14181.58s]  to prove the one guy in chat that called me a normie. I don't even. Holy shit, man. I played
[14181.58s -> 14227.94s]  this level in a Latin and I hated it just the same. How much did I bump? Oh God, sorry. God,
[14227.94s -> 14253.53s]  please. I don't have any. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. That was it right there. Oh, I just. I'm rushing
[14253.53s -> 14262.57s]  now because I want to be done with this. All right, I gotta slow down. This is just never
[14262.57s -> 14279.59s]  gonna happen. B-side or normie. You know, what if I don't care if I'm a normie? Huh? Is that really
[14279.59s -> 14328.41s]  that much of a problem for some of you? This is it. It's normie proof. This is what at the center
[14328.41s -> 14357.70s]  of all of this. It's so empty and vast yet it feels nostalgic somehow and peaceful. Heart of
[14357.70s -> 14379.88s]  the mountain. All right. Yo, he's not a normie. No, that's not true. I have to beat the seasides
[14379.88s -> 14397.94s]  tape. I'm not going to do it, but that's okay. There's no way I'm going to do that. Absolutely
[14397.94s -> 14417.34s]  not. Well, there's the bonus chapter. Now I. Wait, I did the first B-sides. Where's the other one?
[14417.34s -> 14423.82s]  I did this one already. Yeah. 200 times died here. All right, this is the celestial resort.
[14423.82s -> 14445.40s]  I think we got a B-side here. One B is not unlocked. That's okay. This feels great compared
[14445.40s -> 14456.20s]  to the thing I just did. I say that now and I'm going to eat those words. I'm going to
[14456.20s -> 14482.42s]  inhale those words very quickly, aren't I? Shit. Well, uh-oh. Did beating that last bonus chapter
[14482.42s -> 14488.58s]  just set in complete gamer fatigue? Am I? Can I even do this anymore? I might not be able to.
[14489.38s -> 14526.52s]  Let me see. All right. All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I think I have to jump around.
[14527.16s -> 14534.71s]  Oh God. I don't know. Up and then over, up and then over again. Maybe. Let's try it.
[14535.67s -> 14550.73s]  I might need to take a Shito break. Again, I did the same damn thing. All right. Maybe. Let me try
[14550.73s -> 14590.33s]  this a few more times and then we might take a Shito break. Oh my God. I blew it. I blew it.
[14590.33s -> 14607.06s]  No, I didn't. It's still possible. It's still very possible. Hair got in my face.
[14607.70s -> 14613.98s]  It's like eating my hair. I'm just going, I'm shaking the whole thing off. I'm going bald.
[14614.86s -> 14639.37s]  I don't even need to do it. I can just fall down and grab it. I was not doing the same. Oh my God.
[14643.80s -> 14651.29s]  Shito time. Yeah. I don't know. I might, I might have to put the cap on, Celeste.
[14652.33s -> 14657.42s]  It's a great game, but it's kind of only so much you can do in one sitting.
[14658.30s -> 14661.43s]  Well, last night it was like five hours or so. I beat it four hours.
[14663.56s -> 14666.12s]  These kind of games, they just drain the fuck out of my brain.
[14677.10s -> 14693.75s]  I should be able to do at least somewhat. I think you got to go down. I saved the dash maybe.
[14694.63s -> 14702.44s]  Yeah. Game of Fatigue sets in and then you kind of, you kind of can't do anything.
[14703.40s -> 14710.82s]  This might turn into like a fucking automaton scream. That was it. That was it. You get to
[14710.82s -> 14713.70s]  jump around. I got it. I got it. I'll get it here. You got to jump around and grab the weapon.
[14714.50s -> 14728.06s]  Like that. No, it's no good. It's so frustrating. You trying to move with your hands in the same,
[14728.06s -> 14747.13s]  in the right direction. It just doesn't happen. It's a great, it's a great game.
[14747.13s -> 14753.78s]  It's one of, it's very challenging, very fun. As you can see, I'm still playing it even though
[14753.78s -> 14764.14s]  Game of Fatigue is set in. We're still going. Oh shit, I don't have two jumps anymore.
[14764.14s -> 14781.29s]  I can tell he hates it. I don't, what are you, I don't hate it. Holy shit. How am I going to do this?
[14781.29s -> 14787.75s]  You got to go up and then cross. Yikes, I don't know. Yikes, yikes, yikes.
[14789.27s -> 14807.06s]  He has tears rolling down his cheeks. They're streaming down my face.
[14807.86s -> 14821.19s]  Guys, the bottom is going to cause so many problems because I have to go back, don't I?
[14821.91s -> 14851.83s]  I'm just going to wait. That's going to be unbearable. Okay. Okay. Hold on. Ah, fuck.
[14860.54s -> 14865.77s]  Oh my God. There's no way to stop. You just have to go. You can't stop for anything.
[14866.57s -> 14909.18s]  That's not correct. Oh, I got to go up to the top right. This is how you do it.
[14910.26s -> 14913.62s]  The one thing is though, I got to take a look at how the hell I'm going to get the one on the top
[14913.62s -> 14922.02s]  right. I haven't even seen it yet. I haven't paid any attention to it. So it's off that and then into
[14922.02s -> 14938.41s]  the wall and then back around. And I have to grab that ledge there at the bottom. Nope. I need that
[14938.41s -> 14950.12s]  dash. Oh, come on. Why? Why do you have to be down here? Don't ever beat this level. The music's too
[14950.12s -> 15015.38s]  good. How many screens are left on this B side here? No, that's not what I want to do. I just stayed
[15015.38s -> 15039.30s]  down. That's it. I figured it out, but I'm not going to have enough strength. I'm going to grab
[15039.30s -> 15072.70s]  the ledge and like slow these guys down by like even 5%. I'm so sick of this. I just freaked out.
[15088.98s -> 15094.18s]  No, I would have had it. Just the timing, timing, timing, timing, timing, timing. Like, oh now. Oh,
[15094.18s -> 15102.74s]  go. Okay. Go. Okay. I can't stop right now. I'll lose all this progress. I have to get to the end
[15102.74s -> 15110.34s]  of this. And then I'm going to transition to like IRL for like 40 minutes. Oh yeah. Yikes.
[15111.14s -> 15118.54s]  Suck cost. I already, look at this. It's like screen number five.
[15119.42s -> 15163.98s]  There can't be that much more happening. I had to grab on. The one thing that sucks is because you
[15163.98s -> 15169.18s]  have such a small amount of area to have to grab and you just suck to it. And it's so difficult
[15169.18s -> 15174.81s]  to just not jump. You've got such a tiny little area. See, like I just grabbed that. I really
[15174.81s -> 15182.17s]  didn't want to. And I could have, I could have around, around, around. Oh man. Absolute zero room
[15182.17s -> 15191.64s]  for error. Zero. You gotta be a fucking robot. Like that. I, and I didn't want to jump meat boy.
[15191.64s -> 15224.12s]  You fucked my whole game up. Fuck off meat boy. I had no, oh, I couldn't believe it. Fucking
[15224.12s -> 15244.28s]  Donkey Kong. It's going to take all night. No, I thought I had two jumps. How do they take that
[15244.28s -> 15247.40s]  away from me? I should have done this earlier. No, I shouldn't have. What are you talking about?
[15248.28s -> 15274.78s]  Anybody know how many screens I have left after this one? Two? Let me sit here for a second.
[15280.31s -> 15287.06s]  Aye yi yi. There's just so many moving parts. There's so many moving parts that need to perfect.
[15307.00s -> 15331.16s]  Eat my ass. Let's go. Let's skip that one. Just go to this one.
[15331.88s -> 15347.90s]  Where were you when Shito died of neglect? He's flying. He's eating today. I threw up in his mouth.
[15347.90s -> 15366.70s]  He's gonna be just fine. Oh yeah, I gotta, I don't know. I'm sorry. I'm trying my best.
[15366.70s -> 15376.98s]  And it's just like, it's so much to have to do. Yeah, where the fuck was Einstein during this shit?
[15377.62s -> 15382.23s]  Do you think Einstein would have been able to do this? No, he would have been like, what the
[15382.23s -> 15387.51s]  fuck is this shit? I have to climb on the side and just, I don't get it. And then people would be
[15387.51s -> 15393.03s]  like, oh, boomer. Einstein, you're a boomer. What is, what are you saying? I don't get this either.
[15413.40s -> 15425.30s]  Boom, boom. Oh, that's the spikes. It's just like, you gotta go down when it's up and up.
[15425.30s -> 15429.06s]  When it's down, your brain doesn't work that way. Your brain doesn't work in that kind of order.
[15429.62s -> 15446.55s]  I'm gonna beat this one. Trust me. I can go through. I can dash. I jumped for no reason.
[15468.94s -> 15477.69s]  This is not nearly the hardest B-side. I'll never do this. Just torture yourself. You know,
[15477.69s -> 15497.38s]  I don't want to torture myself. I'm gonna do a couple of them. A couple as in just this one.
[15497.38s -> 15514.63s]  I already did one. I did one yesterday too. Now I get, it's like running in with the background,
[15514.63s -> 15545.69s]  that little tiny two boxes. I thought I didn't grab the edge, this small little fucking area
[15545.69s -> 15554.87s]  to grab. Now I'm getting angry and you're not gonna, I can't play well when you're just
[15554.87s -> 15598.68s]  fucking angry. See? I have no idea where to go. I have no idea what's happening that way. You know,
[15598.68s -> 15602.14s]  I probably would assume that this would be the hardest. I'm going to open up one of the other
[15602.14s -> 15608.38s]  B-sides. As you all know, like the whole game I've had trouble with the things that move in
[15608.38s -> 15614.97s]  up and down, up and down. They've caused me a problem the whole game. So, you know, this might
[15614.97s -> 15644.06s]  just be my kryptonite. Like I have to wait for the perfect opportunity. All right, I guess it's now.
[15644.06s -> 15708.71s]  I'm so screwed. Oh, it's so painful. I tried to let go. I tried. Now I guess, and then around,
[15708.71s -> 15729.70s]  I guess, oh my lord, you gotta, probably the correct way to do it is just wrap around the guy.
[15731.53s -> 15738.92s]  Right? And yeah, that's it. I did it. Oh, that took forever. Not this. What am I supposed to do about this?
[15744.44s -> 15759.82s]  Fake bits. You made me laugh and it ruined everything. $300 in fake bits.
[15766.74s -> 15789.42s]  No, no more of these moving sponges. I got it. Yeah, you did.
[15800.01s -> 15808.70s]  That's kind of what I need to do. Kind of. Maybe. In some weird wild world. Hey, thanks for the $500,000,
[15808.70s -> 15820.66s]  guys. Prove this is pre-recorded. How am I supposed to prove that? That, that's how.
[15821.54s -> 15842.86s]  No, stop saying these things. And what am I? I didn't get the diamond. Didn't get the diamond.
[15846.89s -> 15886.92s]  Money is all he cares about. That's not true. Oh my god, no. I just, oh goodness. Just jump over it
[15886.92s -> 15918.31s]  and then across. Yes, I just do that. That one was not that bad, but this is probably going to be bad.
[15922.04s -> 15933.59s]  Turn on the face cam and that falls. No, no face cam. You need to do that.
[15938.62s -> 15941.74s]  Please just jump off it over and over again. I would love it if you did that.
[15944.38s -> 15949.18s]  Here's the funny thing. I am never going to be able to play Meat Boy ever again. Nothing like I would,
[15949.18s -> 15962.33s]  but I'm going to try to like climb onto walls and stuff. I have no idea. How the fuck would
[15962.33s -> 15987.91s]  you ever do that on the first try? I win. No, I didn't. Oh no, this guy's back again.
[15988.87s -> 16013.16s]  Jump over that. Jump over it. I have to jump on his head.
[16020.31s -> 16059.72s]  Cheeto's coming. Um, honest to god, it's the analog or the d-pad. Even if you had something precise,
[16060.76s -> 16065.32s]  this would just be fucking so hard to get that. You're going to jump up and grab. How the hell
[16065.32s -> 16097.14s]  are you supposed to do that? You got to go around and grab it again. That has to be how to do it.
[16097.14s -> 16127.51s]  I'm going to be so glad when I'm done with this. Just get me to the end of this.
[16128.39s -> 16134.58s]  But you can only do one of these like once a year. Or you're going to lose, you're going to just go
[16134.58s -> 16150.82s]  hollow. You'll just lose your sanity. Doing like the B-sides is seriously, is like smoking
[16150.82s -> 16197.18s]  three packs of cigarettes a day. This game isn't even that hard. Just put your face on the stove
[16197.18s -> 16214.09s]  tub. That would be so stupid. Like you have to be so perfect. Why? Oh, I think I'm done.
[16214.81s -> 16221.70s]  I think I'm done. I gave it a good attempt, but I'm too fatigued. I'm too drained to do this.
[16229.53s -> 16232.73s]  I'm giving up at the finish line. I don't want to smoke any more cigarettes.
[16233.45s -> 16245.24s]  I don't want to smoke any more cigarettes. You understand? Oh, just put your face on the stove
[16246.04s -> 16267.37s]  That's it. I ran out. The spring was so close. I just had to touch the spring and I would have had
[16267.37s -> 16292.66s]  it done. Oh my God. Okay. It's been like 150 attempts and that's the first time that guy has
[16292.66s -> 16324.23s]  hit me. You don't even need to be here. This will still be unbearable. Wait for me. Did I win? I've
[16324.23s -> 16341.54s]  got to jump on him up there. I got to hit him. No, I don't. My God. You've got to be kidding me.
[16342.42s -> 16397.34s]  I, what happened to my jump? What? Do it for Shito. I'm going to try. What else have you got for me?
[16407.08s -> 16442.18s]  I got to hit him. I got to jump on his head. How am I supposed to get that one?
[16452.79s -> 16462.44s]  Give Shito the controller. It's not going to help. Oh fuck. No, I almost got hit him in the head.
[16462.44s -> 16470.47s]  Oh, you got to. Oh, this is just a noise scream. All I'm doing is making noises and shit.
[16471.35s -> 16476.36s]  Just getting my ass kicked and making noises. I didn't even get that one over there.
[16492.66s -> 16510.60s]  No shit. I would have had it. I got to get it done. I fucked myself so hard.
[16512.12s -> 16518.50s]  Screwed myself. Oh my God. I just screwed myself over so badly. So hard.
[16521.06s -> 16535.26s]  Not get that by jumping on his head. That's like what you're supposed to do.
[16536.54s -> 16555.88s]  And that is what you're supposed to do. I didn't want to jump that way.
[16556.84s -> 16577.74s]  What hit me? I don't even know what hit me. I'm still not even understanding this yet.
[16577.74s -> 16581.18s]  This is going to take me like another 300 attempts to beat this stupid fucking level.
[16591.38s -> 16601.00s]  I didn't, I just, all right. It's the let go of right trigger. I would have probably had a good
[16601.00s -> 16636.30s]  attempt there. Screwed it up again. I can get it back. Eat a snack and regroup. No, I can't. I'm
[16636.30s -> 16649.40s]  never coming. I'm never opening this game ever again. So I better do it now. I better do it now.
[16657.34s -> 16662.46s]  Hates game. No, I just, I can't. I'm at the point of the game where I'd beat it and it's just the
[16662.46s -> 16670.82s]  excruciating shit left. When am I going to have time to do this? I'm not going to stream it.
[16671.54s -> 16675.85s]  I got to like cook food and shit. I had to cook food. Ah.
[16677.05s -> 16687.13s]  Guys, do you understand my daily routine? I stream a game and then I cook food for
[16687.69s -> 16695.59s]  seven and a half hours. I'm done. I've lost it all.
[16702.17s -> 16707.05s]  It's just my brain can't handle these emotions and movements. I have to finish it though.
[16708.09s -> 16732.30s]  Otherwise we can't see Shido. You got to do it on this one. You got to hit it there. I fucked it
[16732.30s -> 16744.28s]  up. What even hit me? What the fuck even hit me? This sucks such ass. Oh, I'm gonna, do you want
[16744.28s -> 16769.22s]  to talk about a 2018 meltdown? It's going to happen right here. This is too much. Why did those pop
[16769.22s -> 16778.01s]  out? I thought I had to touch them first. I'm not even close by the way. There's like another
[16778.01s -> 16794.84s]  whole, I'm at like the first third of this whole page, this whole screen. He's losing his mind. I
[16794.84s -> 16813.32s]  am starting to lose my mind. I got to hit him. I have to hit it. What the fuck happened? What? No.
[16813.32s -> 16829.34s]  Oh, I'm being shocked. I'm being strangled. It's this fun, really fun mechanic called stuff
[16829.90s -> 16834.86s]  grows out after you touch the wall. It's the funnest fucking mechanic in the game.
[16834.86s -> 16867.48s]  It's my favorite. Have I told you about my favorite, Tweety? It's the best. And suddenly I
[16867.48s -> 16879.80s]  begin to see. Suddenly I begin to see. I've got a golden ticket. It's ours, Charlie.
[16880.28s -> 16900.20s]  I didn't even move. Why is it growing? All right. All right. Like fuck, fuck that dumb watch. You
[16900.20s -> 16905.40s]  want to know the part that's really annoying when he's about to dash and he distorts the screen.
[16905.40s -> 16911.59s]  Like, look at it. What? Like what? Why? Why does it have to happen? Like, is there a reason why that
[16911.59s -> 16941.74s]  has to happen? Can I like turn that feature off? It's giving me blurry vision. I had to be too.
[16943.37s -> 16953.18s]  Unbelievable. Again, I didn't fucking move. I didn't do shit. It was the opportunity. That
[16953.18s -> 16957.75s]  just fucking ruined everything. But no, it didn't. I have to hit him in the head.
[16960.18s -> 16982.60s]  Don't grab. Over. Don't even think about it. Remember I watched this guy stream this game
[16984.18s -> 16988.90s]  and it's not even hard. Like I do this in like fucking two tries. It wasn't mine.
[16988.90s -> 16996.90s]  It was like crazy. Have you heard of this guy? Oh yeah, he's terrible at the game. He's like
[16996.90s -> 17001.30s]  really bad and blames a bunch of stuff on his Xbox controller. I don't think he even has an
[17001.30s -> 17005.70s]  Xbox controller. I think he's using like a PC madcast controller. I don't know. I think he's
[17005.70s -> 17022.12s]  just an idiot. We gotta time this. We gotta wait. I have to go now. I have to go now and then oh
[17022.68s -> 17031.50s]  I gotta land over there. Don't move. Okay. Now I've got an opportunity. I gotta bounce
[17032.78s -> 17042.54s]  and stupid game. I did it. I win. I win. I win. I win. I win. I win. I did it. I did it. I did it.
[17042.54s -> 17069.85s]  Just touch it. I win. No, not that number.
[17079.35s -> 17081.67s]  Of all the numbers you could have given me, you have to give me that one.
[17084.14s -> 17113.61s]  Uh, well, okay. All right, wait a minute. 342, 243. This is actually cursed. I need to never play
[17113.61s -> 17125.70s]  the game again. I don't get the reference. Uh, that number was like a meme joke number
[17126.42s -> 17145.98s]  from like a year and a half ago. It was killed last year or the year before. That's weird.
[17146.14s -> 17183.22s]  The best song? We're about to hear it. Where's Shito? I know, but just wait. I just need to see
[17183.22s -> 17201.08s]  how this one is. This one's not bad. This one's okay. That was close. Oh, well, I didn't know that.
[17212.81s -> 17215.61s]  Is my brain fried? Oh yeah, it's fried like an hour and a half ago.
[17216.65s -> 17238.23s]  It pisses you up in the ear. Take a guess. I think I need, no. Okay, hold on, hold on. I can get it
[17238.23s -> 17246.82s]  from there. I'm gonna need a caretaker if I play for another five minutes. Yeah, I just need
[17248.09s -> 17263.62s]  to see what this one is. I'm not going to play through this one unless, hold on. We get to see
[17263.62s -> 17272.18s]  Shito and then I'm probably going to go for like, maybe like an hour from now. Wait, but yeah, I'm
[17272.18s -> 17280.86s]  addicted. Okay. This is okay though because there's no moving parts. It's just spikes
[17281.50s -> 17306.55s]  and be careful. Don't screw it up. That's the name of this game. Holy shit. The moving part.
[17317.42s -> 17321.26s]  God, that was supposed to work. How are you supposed to get that done?
[17322.06s -> 17329.98s]  How are you even supposed to do this? It's not even possible. It's not possible to do this.
[17330.86s -> 17362.57s]  It's impossible to do this. What do I do? I did it and I needed another centimeter.
[17363.69s -> 17368.26s]  Why would they even put the spike? You like, I beat the level. You really have to put
[17368.82s -> 17374.74s]  a huge thing of spikes at the very fucking end, right at the end. Like, I already did all this
[17374.74s -> 17392.44s]  bullshit and you're gonna make me do it again. And just derma overrated. Auto-updated. Long
[17392.44s -> 17407.35s]  have we awaited. Shito activated. You know, when you get to a position like this where you
[17407.35s -> 17415.80s]  watched the level get completed, I already, I completed it. So I'm going back and doing it
[17415.80s -> 17422.46s]  again and I don't like it. You know, I don't like that. It was completed. Yes, it was. I completed
[17422.46s -> 17427.90s]  it. I did it. No, I did. I did. I did it. I beat the level and that's all there is to it.
[17428.62s -> 17436.09s]  I had an unfair troll spike at the very end. That's on Xbox. It's me, Xbox.
[17436.97s -> 17447.32s]  Just when you thought you had a good attempt, Xbox comes around and gives you extra sodium.
[17448.04s -> 17472.44s]  I'm all the way back in my chair. I did it already. This guy's a fucking nutcase.
[17473.40s -> 17482.86s]  Hey, I made some mashed potatoes. Would you like some? I would love some. Please put some on my
[17482.86s -> 17490.26s]  plate. Is this real? Are you kidding? Dude, don't do that. I love mashed potatoes. Don't fucking do that.
[17491.86s -> 17561.26s]  He's awake. Do you want to, do you want to be on stream? No, you don't want to be on stream.
[17561.26s -> 17570.89s]  Is there, is there a reason why? What's wrong? Chat was being very mean to me and you don't like
[17570.89s -> 17590.01s]  that. No. What, what should I tell them? Okay. That if they, if they want you to be on camera,
[17590.09s -> 17602.84s]  yeah. Oh, to be, to be nice, being nicer to me. Oh, okay. You want to go back to bed? Okay. Well,
[17602.84s -> 17616.86s]  um, have a good rest. There you go. Do you like your new bed? You need like a water or anything?
[17616.86s -> 17626.02s]  You gotta, you gotta get to bed. You got school tomorrow. No, no, don't give me that.
[17626.02s -> 17632.10s]  Excuse me. You have school tomorrow. You gotta get up. You gotta learn. No, go get to bed. I'll
[17632.10s -> 17640.98s]  get you. I'll read you a story later. Okay. You want a story? Okay. Sure. Everybody see you later.
[17645.02s -> 17654.52s]  Good night. I'm sorry. I wasn't paying attention to what was going on here. What, uh, what's going
[17654.52s -> 17684.68s]  on in chat here? He's talking to a toy now. Toy. I mean, she told me. Okay. What am I doing wrong
[17684.68s -> 17695.27s]  here? I swear to God, I don't get it. I just dashed down, right? I'm just overthinking the
[17695.27s -> 17728.62s]  fuck out of that. And it's the very end. It's the block. Oh my God. What am I doing? Fuck. I just
[17728.62s -> 17735.34s]  got, oh man. You just have to dash or do you? I don't even know. I think my eye might be bleeding.
[17737.02s -> 17773.34s]  I made it. Okay. I'm good. My eyes bleeding. No, those are just cheaters. You just gotta be quick.
[17773.34s -> 17791.61s]  I gotta get right to the bottom. I jump. How on earth am I supposed to get up there that fast?
[17793.13s -> 17809.02s]  Like that. Okay. This is Wynn. Thanks for watching. I'll see you guys later.
[17809.90s -> 17816.71s]  See you guys in the next stream. It's going to be a fun one. We're going to be playing on drink ass.
[17816.71s -> 17851.37s]  Remember that? I'm actually not entirely certain on what the fuck I need to do here.
[17852.49s -> 17861.29s]  What stream do I die? Uh, January 23rd is when I'm supposed to be dying. That's the date that I was
[17861.29s -> 17880.12s]  told from the fortune teller thing. You have it marked on your calendar. That's kind of morbid.
[17881.24s -> 17900.62s]  That's how you do it. Okay. It's grabbing me. Get on top and jump again. That's how you do it.
[17901.26s -> 17926.01s]  Gotta get it. You dumb game. It's so strong. This might be one of the last screens before I, uh,
[17927.38s -> 17932.66s]  literally shit my pants on camera. No, don't say that. No, I get it. I'm just, I'm very
[17933.22s -> 17953.51s]  frustrated and I'm saying things. Okay. I'm fine. Take a break and come back refreshed.
[17954.71s -> 17963.38s]  No, I'll be all right. I think, I think I'm over the, uh, over the hump there. I can just relax
[17963.38s -> 17983.72s]  and just chill and like, I can do it. Ball. The wind is so bad because it just, it, everything
[17983.72s -> 17988.76s]  you've known and done the whole game, the compensating for the jumps and the dashes,
[17988.76s -> 17994.84s]  it just makes you everything you've done the whole game. You have to redo it again because you have
[17994.84s -> 17999.96s]  the muscle memory for jumps and dashes and they just make you slower and faster whenever they damn
[17999.96s -> 18021.19s]  well feel like it. Oh my God. I didn't even, I didn't know that was it. $50. $50 from Colonel Zero.
[18021.91s -> 18030.42s]  Thank you so much for the 50 bucks. 5,000 bits. Didn't I jump on that? Why didn't it refresh my
[18030.42s -> 18039.96s]  jump? Uh, German for the love of God, please stop is what they say. I'm doing just fine.
[18040.92s -> 18054.89s]  I appreciate the concern. Stop. I'm still having fun. If I wasn't having fun, you'd know
[18054.89s -> 18064.23s]  because I would say things like, uh, I, this is stupid. Uh, fuck this controller. Uh, this game is
[18064.23s -> 18070.06s]  too fucking hard. Why am I doing this? I have to stop like stuff like that. That's what you typically
[18070.06s -> 18082.04s]  would hear. Another great one is, uh, why is this in the game? Uh, like for instance, if I were to
[18082.04s -> 18086.20s]  take like a, I mean, I haven't done this, but like you could tell if I was like a little bit upset
[18086.20s -> 18090.76s]  about something. And if, uh, you know, you know, what's with the wind mechanic, it's fucking ruins
[18090.76s -> 18094.84s]  the game. If there's stuff like that, that's how you can really have an indicator of how things
[18094.84s -> 18104.02s]  are going with the stream so far, you know, or, um, holding right on the Xbox controller for some
[18104.02s -> 18109.54s]  reason makes you go upright. If you hear that, then there's a possibility that I might be a little,
[18109.54s -> 18119.19s]  just a slight, small amount irritated. Again, all things that have not really happened yet.
[18120.07s -> 18137.56s]  So I'm fine. Beat that screen. That was fun. Well, this one's not going to be fun. Can I not move it?
[18138.20s -> 18183.45s]  I think I just have to grab the wall. Uh, the other side. I don't think I even need the spring.
[18190.78s -> 18197.45s]  Holy shit. I gotta go much faster than that. Say something funny. Um, how about
[18198.33s -> 18222.47s]  0.01% of your body evaporates every time I die. That doesn't sound good. Well, how, how much of
[18222.55s -> 18240.81s]  there is, how much is left of you? I, okay. So I might have to dash underneath like this. Like,
[18240.81s -> 18263.19s]  no, that's the live way to get around the other side. Straight up dash above the platform. I mean,
[18263.19s -> 18269.11s]  isn't that, that'll kill me, won't it? So I have to talk about dash up and then move around. That's
[18269.11s -> 18311.37s]  going to be absolute hell. How many cigarettes have I spoken so far?
[18312.25s -> 18328.26s]  Okay. I, you've got to be fucking kidding me. How are you? Why? Why do you have to do that?
[18328.90s -> 18346.15s]  Is there really a reason to do that? Have you switched sides like that again? I can't even do
[18346.15s -> 18365.14s]  it again. I'm out of grip. I'm not even sure if I'm halfway up or not. I gotta get around again
[18365.94s -> 18390.94s]  and then around again and then around again. I did it. Wow. Okay. Bullshit. Another big bits.
[18392.14s -> 18407.32s]  Uh, G-H-Y-D-H-F-E. Thank you. Uh, GID. Thank you for the 50 bucks. 5,000 bits. Thank you so much. Hey,
[18407.32s -> 18411.40s]  Jerma, I've had countless sleepless nights for years because of the single question. If you got
[18411.40s -> 18452.90s]  cloned, would you, um, well, to answer your question, throw right into that. Uh, I would,
[18454.01s -> 18462.95s]  um, I'm going to, I'm going to go with a no. No. What was the answer to the question? What kind
[18462.95s -> 18499.75s]  of question is that? Answer the question. No. All right. I got it. No more clone. No more clone
[18499.75s -> 18505.11s]  question. And I have to wait because so many of these levels have the one thing in the level
[18505.11s -> 18514.12s]  that's timed. I got a timing moving object and I also have a bunch of fucking wind.
[18514.76s -> 18533.08s]  How many times I've said, oh my fucking God, it's probably been like 5,000 times.
[18534.12s -> 18544.30s]  Is this, I think I'm, is this where I turn this, just turn this off and eat a packet of cigarettes
[18544.30s -> 18584.47s]  on screen? I think I can make that. I have to wait. No, I didn't. All right. I think this is where I
[18584.47s -> 18592.46s]  give up for another day with my, like my niece or my nephew when they're old enough to play it.
[18592.46s -> 18596.78s]  Cause I won't open it ever again. So we'll see whenever, whenever, whenever they play it in like
[18596.78s -> 18643.35s]  30 years. What am I doing? Name your child. Honestly, I didn't even want to. Can I, can I
[18643.35s -> 18649.03s]  even make that jump though? I don't even know if I can. Like, can I make that? I don't know. How far
[18649.03s -> 18674.42s]  down did it go? How did I not make it there? So one guy said it was too loud. So I am inclined to
[18674.42s -> 18693.35s]  agree. Apparently not this time. All right, here we go. That window almost just screwed me over
[18693.35s -> 18707.24s]  there. Oh my God. What the fuck happened? What am I doing? How did I just do that?
[18707.80s -> 18735.66s]  I don't know how I did that. I closed my eyes. The wind is even stronger now. How am I gonna,
[18735.66s -> 18756.66s]  I don't have a dash. You need a dash, you can't do it. Holding right. This is the last time I'm
[18756.66s -> 18760.26s]  ever going to use this controller, by the way. This thing's actually going into the trash.
[18761.06s -> 18764.82s]  And I'm going to actually set up a BS4 controller. This thing is absolute dog shit.
[18765.78s -> 18815.26s]  God. Put a camera on the controller. Just like botched inputs. Again, nothing changed. Not one
[18816.22s -> 18821.98s]  single thing changed. I was holding it in the same position as the last one. But for some
[18821.98s -> 18827.61s]  fucked up reason, I didn't want to do it. It was like, no thanks. We're not doing that now.
[18844.23s -> 18847.03s]  Yeah, now there's no more wind and it's like ruining everything.
[18847.03s -> 18889.06s]  Does that go all the way up? I fucked it up. Wait, no, I, no, I gotta jump around and down,
[18889.06s -> 18905.42s]  I think. Yeah, I gotta go down on the same one. Like this. Then go around and then, ah, then
[18905.42s -> 18911.98s]  fall and jump through. And then that's it. I should be there. I could probably go now, but I can't.
[18912.86s -> 18977.03s]  It's close. Just not fast enough. More moving parts. Um, oh, I gotta eventually be on the
[18977.83s -> 18989.45s]  middle one. That sounds like a defeated man. I mean, yeah, but not really though, because I'm
[18989.45s -> 18997.26s]  still completing screens. I might be complaining the whole way there and I might be annoyed by it,
[18997.26s -> 19005.98s]  but it's not defeat until I press the exit button, which will probably actually truly happen.
[19008.55s -> 19019.19s]  Um, at the end of this B-side, because there really is only so much of these games you can take
[19019.19s -> 19022.55s]  before you have to, you have to just stop looking at a screen.
[19049.30s -> 19055.54s]  When the game forces you to go a certain speed, you're just dangling in so many directions. Like
[19055.54s -> 19083.78s]  I want to just go with my speed. Grillmaster Braid. Wasn't he voted worst character last year?
[19092.62s -> 19143.11s]  Yeah, he was. I think that has to go first. I gotta, I gotta go. I'm doing it in reverse.
[19144.55s -> 19173.05s]  Touch the damn thing. You finicky dumb cloud. What are you doing? Did it, what did it just hit?
[19173.77s -> 19195.69s]  What? What did it hit? Uh, what is it hitting? I have to pull it. This is so, this is pain.
[19195.69s -> 19229.13s]  It actually is pain. Oh no, man. What does that thing have? Can somebody explain to me
[19229.85s -> 19236.25s]  what this arrow above me is even for? If you just touch it and it moves, why is it here? What's the
[19236.25s -> 19242.66s]  point of this being here? It doesn't change it. It just, it's just annoying. What was it even there
[19242.66s -> 19286.49s]  for? It's just adding an extra two, three seconds to the game. For what? This is so painful. This is
[19286.49s -> 19315.38s]  the last hard game for like six months. Seriously, my God. There's no Grillmaster Braid. He's not
[19315.38s -> 19329.83s]  even real. Say it's not real. All right. Okay. That's time to go. That's time to go. I can't
[19329.83s -> 19353.48s]  take this shit anymore. I have to pull that out of the way. You got to pull that shit out of the way
[19353.48s -> 19396.87s]  too. Wrong side. I hope this is one of the last screens because you know what I mean? Like, nope.
[19396.87s -> 19406.89s]  The fact that you got to just get on the other side so quickly. It's just, my God, it's, it's so
[19406.89s -> 19421.42s]  excruciating. It's excruciating. Is it jumping and moving? It's just so, my goodness. The fucking
[19421.50s -> 19449.38s]  cloud. Nice cloud. Why? It's like, oh my God, this stupid jumping mechanic is so fucking annoying.
[19449.38s -> 19456.41s]  It's like, it makes me want to scream. Trampoline effect that you have to produce with this thing
[19456.41s -> 19498.55s]  every time. Oh, old man yells at cloud. That's a Simpsons joke. Grabbing the edges. There's so much
[19498.55s -> 19503.43s]  room for error like that. Like just trying to get on the other side of this stupid fucking
[19504.31s -> 19524.78s]  Minecraft block. It's got to be perfect. 100% perfect. You got, you got two tramp,
[19524.78s -> 19552.68s]  you got three trampoline clouds to deal with here. Get it out of the way. Is this the last screen?
[19552.68s -> 19578.65s]  I hope it is. My nieces and nephews are going to love this game. Why didn't, what, why? Why is this
[19578.65s -> 19586.25s]  stuff holding on to it? Oh, but so, why did it not move for that time? What was the reason for it? I
[19586.25s -> 19600.74s]  don't understand. It, I grabbed it. Dr. Phil raid? I don't care. Dr. Phil. I'm gonna need to go on
[19600.74s -> 19629.40s]  Dr. Phil after I'm done with this. Why can you please just move out of the goddamn way?
[19639.21s -> 19644.86s]  Move! Wait, what? Wait, I have to stand on top? It wasn't in the right spot? Oh, I don't know.
[19645.90s -> 19650.06s]  It has to be in the perfect middle spot and you ride it. Ah, I didn't even know what the,
[19650.06s -> 19664.25s]  I've never seen it before. Okay, that's it. That's it, I'm done. No fucking way. I thought
[19664.25s -> 19672.70s]  there was space to ride it up. I didn't know I had to go right on top of it. If only there was a
[19672.70s -> 19682.42s]  telescope. But I don't, I'm too angry to look at that telescope. It's gonna kill me. Watch. Look.
[19683.70s -> 19693.75s]  I thought there was space on side. I really did. I, I don't think I would have had it anyways
[19693.75s -> 19707.54s]  because I didn't get the top one fast enough. I'm so close to doing this. Like, I have to do it. I
[19707.54s -> 19713.22s]  have to at least get past this screen. Like, I have to. I'm already, I've already been here so long
[19713.94s -> 19725.69s]  memorizing the whole damn level. Doesn't matter. Even if I touch it. I didn't grab it in the
[19725.69s -> 19761.75s]  perfect place. I didn't, that didn't catch. How did I not jump on that second one? And I'm just, I,
[19762.71s -> 19769.18s]  I'm so annoyed with this level. Like, can't I just jump around? Do I have to do this, like,
[19769.18s -> 19789.19s]  pull the lever bullshit? I feel like I'm playing a different game. Get out of the fucking way.
[19789.91s -> 19821.74s]  This game is ripping off Celeste. Who are we raiding? Jerma! Oh, it's a Jerma raid!
[19822.46s -> 19840.71s]  Thanks a lot, Jerma! This is gonna be really hard to do because I have to change the analog position
[19840.71s -> 19851.35s]  a lot of times and we all know how well that goes. The dash out of that? I have no idea.
[19851.35s -> 19862.94s]  Can I just jump over it? I think I've tried that like twice and it doesn't do anything.
[19864.06s -> 19884.20s]  Yeah, for my sanity's sake, this has got to be the last time I fucking do this.
[19886.10s -> 19890.26s]  I'm talking like tonight. Like, this is it. When I get to the end of this, whatever, whatever this
[19890.26s -> 19899.11s]  side of, whatever tape this is on, whatever mixtape this is, is it. I can't, you have to,
[19899.11s -> 19907.29s]  how am I supposed, how do I do that? Go back. If I dash, I hit the wall. If I try to jump over it,
[19907.29s -> 19932.36s]  fall over, I hit the wall. I must have to fall a little and then dash up. Yeah, I just want to
[19932.36s -> 19958.07s]  go up. No, I'm just trying to rush now. Fuck off. More wind. This has got to be it. Oh, the wind
[19958.07s -> 19971.78s]  starts and goes different directions. How, fucking gimmicks, man. Like, any, any more gimmicks? You
[19971.78s -> 20024.38s]  got any more gimmicks? I just have to, this is the last screen. Nope. Wait, don't go. Just wait.
[20024.94s -> 20044.92s]  There's no reason to. I'm going to jump directly into the fucking wind and I'm going to wait for
[20044.92s -> 20060.71s]  the wind to pick up here. I didn't even mean to do that. That was the end. I could probably
[20060.71s -> 20081.27s]  have done it in one go. What are you guys even doing? No, I, no, I had to do it because I was
[20081.27s -> 20100.26s]  going to fall off anyways. I could, hold on. Not it. We're going fucking insane because you
[20103.46s -> 20111.53s]  Okay, that's enough. I'll see you guys. I'll see you guys later. All right. That's going to be,
[20111.53s -> 20122.90s]  all right. This is, this is, no, I have to hold it. No, this is not that bad. This is not that bad.
[20123.54s -> 20141.94s]  It's way worse than you go. You go on the stepped on gum and then you fall. Okay, hold on. All right.
[20141.94s -> 20163.43s]  In 10 tries. If I don't get this, I'm turning it off. One, two, three, that one didn't count.
[20163.43s -> 20182.71s]  I'm angry. I can stop counting. Whatever that was. It was a four, five, six, seven. It's just like,
[20182.71s -> 20188.33s]  give me a goddamn break. He's throwing on purpose. I promise you I'm not. It's just,
[20188.33s -> 20207.32s]  it's just that unbearable. It's just that fucking excruciating intentionally doing it.
[20207.56s -> 20225.77s]  Okay. All right. That's enough. I'll see you guys. No, don't shut off windows.
[20225.77s -> 20232.81s]  I just hit alt F4 and it was trying to shut windows off.
[20238.22s -> 20241.90s]  Save and quit. I don't care. My nieces and nephews are going to love that game.
[20252.58s -> 20259.40s]  This is too much. I looked at chat and somebody wrote that this screen took me an hour to beat.
[20260.04s -> 20267.64s]  It was like, I don't want to do that shit. Maybe my nephew will.
[20275.38s -> 20292.54s]  Oh, she don't raid. Are you serious? All right. Well, I beat it and I did a couple of the sides.
[20292.54s -> 20298.78s]  I just, then I know myself. If I sit there for another fucking hour, I'm going to turn green.
[20306.62s -> 20314.74s]  So here's the deal. Let's go over the rest of the week because yeah, I got to take a break.
[20314.74s -> 20320.30s]  I got to get out of here. I got to go like do an eye wash. I have to go do one of those chemical
[20320.38s -> 20331.80s]  eye washes that are in your science class. So the remainder of the week,
[20333.45s -> 20339.21s]  I'm not going to be live tomorrow. I have a lot to do tomorrow. I've got much to do tomorrow,
[20340.22s -> 20347.03s]  but we're going to go Friday, Saturday and we'll see what from there we're going to go.
[20347.67s -> 20355.69s]  Guess what? Guess what? The Dreamcast is actually going to happen this weekend. It actually is
[20355.69s -> 20361.69s]  going to happen because it's already getting set up. It's already happening. Trust me.
[20362.81s -> 20371.32s]  I promise that the Dreamcast stream will be on Saturday. Promise. 100% promise.
[20371.32s -> 20378.82s]  I probably should do this. But that was Celeste. It's a great game. It's very, very fun.
[20380.57s -> 20386.41s]  If you like platforming games, it's fantastic. It's one of the better ones I've played in a
[20386.41s -> 20394.25s]  long time. If you like hard, very, very hard excruciating stuff, it's in there. It's there.
[20396.92s -> 20407.29s]  It's there. If you like hitting your face against a wall in a game for two straight
[20407.29s -> 20423.66s]  hours, you can do that. It's available. First impression? I would give it a solid
[20426.02s -> 20429.38s]  wind gimmick that really brought it down, like two or three full letter grades.
[20430.26s -> 20437.78s]  I would give it an S+, an S++. But the wind and the moving objects and
[20438.58s -> 20442.90s]  the going back and moving that block back and forth brought that down like four letter grades.
[20444.10s -> 20465.67s]  I give it an A-. I give it an AA in 88 or like a 90. Oh yeah, the YOLO too. 85, 86. No,
[20465.67s -> 20485.91s]  it's not an S++. It started in an S++. Yeah, 88. No, 87. 87. But thank you for joining me
[20486.71s -> 20491.48s]  on this. What do I look like right now? Let's see. Let's see how I look.
[20495.16s -> 20504.82s]  I look a little fucked up. That's just what happens when you play a game like this. He looks
[20504.82s -> 20530.28s]  fucked. Yeah. How my eyes look. You see? He's blushing? No, that's a zit. I mean, it's not
[20530.28s -> 20538.92s]  that big. It's right there, but it is. How do I not age? Just ask me tomorrow when I've aged like three
[20538.92s -> 20546.12s]  cigarettes worth of years from the last like two hours of levels. But that's it. I'll see you guys
[20546.12s -> 20552.60s]  on Friday. We'll go Friday, Saturday and do some Dreamcast. There's something I want to do on
[20552.60s -> 20558.95s]  Friday. Hopefully I can get it ready. It should be a lot of fun. Grow out your beard. I can't grow
[20558.95s -> 20564.07s]  another beard. It doesn't work. It just becomes this mess under here that I just, I can't get rid
[20564.07s -> 20573.19s]  of. And it becomes to a point where it's itchy. It's annoying. It just looks like it's just dirt
[20573.19s -> 20577.91s]  on my face. It looks like somebody just like rubbed dirt like all over here because I don't grow it
[20577.91s -> 20586.30s]  here. I only grow it like here and here. So not gonna happen. It's okay though. Break the controller.
[20586.94s -> 20592.17s]  This is the one I'm talking about right here. This is what I've been using. This guy right here. And
[20592.17s -> 20596.41s]  yeah, I got some, look, I got some like gamer sweat all over the controls. I've been, look, I've
[20596.41s -> 20601.69s]  been playing a tough game for two straight days. You gotta give me, hold on here. And yes, I need
[20601.69s -> 20606.25s]  to cut my nails. I was doing gardening work today before the stream, all right? So I needed those
[20606.25s -> 20619.37s]  nails to rip into the garden and tear out the weeds. We're doing bits? Yeah. Yeah, I got time
[20619.37s -> 20628.86s]  for bits. Let's do them right now. But thanks for joining me. It was, it was a heated, heated,
[20628.86s -> 20635.99s]  heated gaming moments. Hopefully you had fun. It was very, very difficult, but very fun at the same
[20635.99s -> 20653.42s]  time. Otherwise I would not have been doing it. I'm not, I'm not gonna do that. All right. Anyways,
[20654.06s -> 20659.82s]  see you guys on Friday. Celeste gets the recommended stamp of approval. There's a lot
[20659.82s -> 20666.41s]  of content there. There's a lot of time to put into that game if you are so inclined to do so.
[20667.05s -> 20674.17s]  It is there. But thank you Topeck for the one dollar first cheer. Alec four by four. Thanks
[20674.17s -> 20677.21s]  for the one dollar. What's up Jerma? I just got off work and I saw you were streaming. I just had
[20677.21s -> 20687.22s]  to come in and say hello. Well, hello. Was this the last Celeste stream? Uh, yeah. Just because
[20687.22s -> 20693.38s]  the only, I think content that's really still available is those like really hard versions
[20693.38s -> 20699.70s]  of everything. And I need to take like a break from it. I don't think I'll go back to it
[20700.50s -> 20709.50s]  after the main story in the bonus chapter. It's Friday stream is not going to be Celeste.
[20710.46s -> 20725.70s]  It will not. But I still enjoyed my time in it, regardless if I stream it again. And yes,
[20725.70s -> 20730.42s]  I made a few jokes about how I'm never going to open the game again. That might not necessarily
[20730.42s -> 20737.53s]  be true. We'll see. Hey bake me home thanks for the one dollar. Sticky brick thanks for the one
[20737.53s -> 20742.01s]  dollar. Hey Jerma, you or Ahmad should highlight the movie night VOD before it gets deleted.
[20742.73s -> 20746.01s]  I know you've said you don't want too many highlights, but if there's one VOD that deserves
[20746.01s -> 20753.22s]  to be saved, it's that one. Uh, I think it's, it's already on the, it's already on the archive
[20753.22s -> 20768.68s]  channel. I believe in its entirety. So it is, I think currently preserved, at least from my
[20768.68s -> 20776.82s]  understanding. What if the archive channel gets removed? Uh, that would be, that would be
[20777.54s -> 20788.20s]  unfortunate, I guess. But I'll save it. I'll just download it. It's not going to be that hard for
[20788.20s -> 20793.34s]  me to get it. So, but thank you sticky brick. Thank you man boy for the one dollar. Just remember
[20793.34s -> 20805.88s]  that I've never shown you this. It's called fired man. Fired man. So it's just fireman without the
[20805.88s -> 20812.62s]  fire. Thank you topac for the two dollars. Imagine watching this with your grandkids.
[20818.15s -> 20828.31s]  Oh oh oh this is so fucking hard. Oh why would you watch this with your grandkids?
[20829.03s -> 20837.11s]  And that, by the way, that wasn't even from today. That might have sounded like it was from tonight,
[20837.11s -> 20851.72s]  but it wasn't. Thank you dork cube for the one dollar. I don't know why everyone tries to get
[20851.72s -> 20861.06s]  you say to say fucked up shit in these bits. It's just that I'm a, I've gotten a lot better at
[20861.06s -> 20871.66s]  refraining from saying, you know, I've gotten a lot better at finding what bits are trying to
[20871.66s -> 20879.40s]  get me to say things or that maybe shouldn't be read. Getting better at it. But thank you snoozing
[20879.40s -> 20886.74s]  copter for the one dollar. Jerma, are you kidding? Your hair looks splendid. Splendid. Thank you
[20886.74s -> 20896.57s]  snoozing copter. I appreciate that. Devlon two million thanks for the ten dollars. Hey Jay,
[20896.57s -> 20900.81s]  my winter break ends today and I'm moving back into my dorm tomorrow. It's been great watching
[20900.81s -> 20905.05s]  you again. You've helped me decompress after an emotionally taxing first semester of college,
[20905.05s -> 20909.69s]  but I'm probably just being melodramatic. I wouldn't be keeping, I wouldn't be keeping up
[20909.69s -> 20914.17s]  as much as the semester goes on. So take some cash for a shitty ten dollar stream joke.
[20915.05s -> 20928.17s]  Shitty ten dollar stream joke. No, there's no such thing as a shitty joke on this channel.
[20928.89s -> 20940.54s]  There's only, only good jokes. I'm gonna make, you want me to make Shido a bed and just have him
[20940.54s -> 20949.46s]  be able to lie down in a bed over here? Uh, thank you killcode for the one dollar. Hey Jerma,
[20949.46s -> 20981.10s]  I just wanted you to watch this cool clip. Nothing weird about it. I bet. That one? It was,
[20981.10s -> 20984.14s]  that was the joke. We had to get rid of the, we had to get rid of the gnomes.
[20984.94s -> 21004.42s]  Does that make you feel better? Thank you dork cube for the three dollars since we're coming to
[21004.42s -> 21008.58s]  the more emotional part of the game. I just want to say that when I played this game a year ago,
[21008.58s -> 21012.34s]  I was really worried about going to college with my siblings moving away to the city.
[21012.34s -> 21016.42s]  I felt really lost. I still sometimes worry about what the hell I'm gonna do with my life.
[21017.30s -> 21020.74s]  But after playing through this game, it made me realize that the end goal shouldn't get in the
[21020.74s -> 21026.02s]  way of the here and the now. Climbing the mountain is important. Climbing the mountain is important,
[21026.02s -> 21038.58s]  but you get there one jump at a time. This is true. Uh, Rome wasn't built in the day. It's
[21040.01s -> 21052.02s]  a series of steps that you take up. That's it. Trying to do something in a second or in a day
[21053.38s -> 21064.81s]  or a week. Life is a, is a never-ending process. As my mother once said, the road to success is
[21064.81s -> 21092.98s]  always under construction. Oh, what a cool mom. Thank you, dork cube. But yeah, it uh, it does,
[21092.98s -> 21107.35s]  it does speak, it does speak very, very soundly. You know, overcoming obstacles. Thank you for
[21107.35s -> 21122.70s]  the three dollars. Thank you, Divus for the two dollars. Appreciate it. Two dollars from Divus.
[21122.70s -> 21125.98s]  Thank you, Timmy Tim Tim for the one dollar. I would like to apologize from comparing Shito
[21126.54s -> 21132.22s]  to my brother's kazoo. Shito is a beloved family member to you and I see that now. Hope you and
[21132.22s -> 21147.08s]  Shito can find it in your hearts to forgive me. Thank you, uh, Corsure for the two, three dollars
[21147.08s -> 21152.92s]  here. Just use an xbox 360 or ps4 controller. Both feel much better than an xbox one.
[21155.08s -> 21157.72s]  Now it might even be my controller. There might be something wrong with it.
[21158.52s -> 21161.96s]  I did like drop it in the bathtub like three times. It might have something to do with it.
[21162.76s -> 21168.14s]  And the worst, worst controller ever made was the game cube and the n64 controller.
[21171.77s -> 21179.75s]  I love the n64 controller. I think it's great. What was it doing near the bathtub? I was playing,
[21181.03s -> 21185.11s]  I was really addicted to Binding of Isaac and I was taking a bath and I needed to keep playing.
[21185.11s -> 21193.11s]  So I brought my entire computer into the bath, like the bathroom, set it up. I used to do this,
[21193.11s -> 21198.76s]  by the way. This might, you might think this is like funny and dumb and bullshit, but I used to
[21198.76s -> 21204.84s]  bring my computer into the bathroom and go to the bathroom. I would sit on the toilet and have it be
[21204.84s -> 21223.32s]  on the computer. It was such an elaborate setup. Yeah, I've told you that before. And then you
[21223.40s -> 21231.16s]  finish, you're done. And then you like sit there saying to yourself, oh man, I have to tear all
[21231.16s -> 21243.48s]  this down and put it back where it belongs. That's impressive. Hey, mostly lost. Thanks for the one
[21243.48s -> 21250.10s]  dollar. You actually do use vinegar. Derba is right for once in his life. I feel like you've,
[21250.10s -> 21255.72s]  I feel like you've wrote a message. Listen, I think you've wrote a message talking about how
[21255.72s -> 21269.99s]  I'm right once in my life, like 30 times. So am I right once or am I right 30 times? What happens
[21269.99s -> 21274.95s]  when you're right once in your life a shitload of times? Doesn't that mean that you're kind of right
[21274.95s -> 21292.39s]  sometimes? 30 is way too low. Yeah, I'm talking about this week. Hey, it's time for slime. Thanks
[21292.39s -> 21299.98s]  for the one dollar. Hey, Jeremiah, I made you a cool treasure map. The old back seating treasure
[21300.06s -> 21313.75s]  map. Oh god, hold on. Let's look at this. Hold on, I gotta put this on screen. This is great.
[21321.90s -> 21339.53s]  Let's see. Okay, so let's look. The old chat back seating treasure map. Okay, so start here.
[21340.33s -> 21347.26s]  There is a secret here that you should know about. Well, I didn't, I, okay. Okay, again,
[21348.22s -> 21358.65s]  right. Idiot. Here we go. Let's keep going. Blame controller here. Wrong. Jebaited. Toxic chat swamp.
[21360.02s -> 21370.63s]  Just go. Why haven't you found it yet? Treasure. And we're going to Utah.
[21380.46s -> 21391.80s]  This is great. I'm going to frame this and put it on my desk. Thank you for that. That gave me a nice
[21391.80s -> 21397.10s]  little chuckle. Captain Worgen, thanks for the one dollar. Everything you say statistically has
[21397.10s -> 21414.38s]  a 0.8% chance to become a meme. I don't know about everything. Maybe 0.8% of the things I say
[21415.18s -> 21420.71s]  have a 0.8% chance to become a meme. Hey, dork cube, thanks for the one dollar. This stream
[21420.71s -> 21425.43s]  brought to you by mad cats controllers. Mad cats, at least we know how to make a d-pad.
[21430.58s -> 21434.26s]  This stream really was. Well, the last two streams were just the quintessential
[21434.26s -> 21441.05s]  blame the controller. It's the controller. It's the controller, but it was. It was.
[21442.46s -> 21454.92s]  Trust me. I know that in quotes, it's the controller, end quote, is the cheap,
[21455.96s -> 21459.56s]  easy way for somebody to tell you why they're doing something wrong.
[21464.52s -> 21487.14s]  It's the controller. It's not me that sucks. It's everything else. Controller can.
[21489.77s -> 21494.09s]  May as well blame lag while you're at it. Well, I can't blame lag because it's not connected to
[21494.09s -> 21499.06s]  the internet. I would have. If there was an opportunity when I fell off the ledge or something,
[21499.06s -> 21505.14s]  oh yeah, I got like 200 ping. It's impossible. It's unplayable. I would have done it. I absolutely
[21505.14s -> 21509.24s]  would have done it. Would have done it. Would have done it. It's like not rolling off my tongue
[21509.24s -> 21514.54s]  that well for some reason. Hey, dork cube, thank you, but you just said the mad cats thing. Thank
[21514.54s -> 21520.10s]  you. Thank you. Genie boy for the one dollar checkmate. Those who say German mustard
[21520.82s -> 21533.53s]  isn't an instrument. An instrument. What do you mean instrument? Thank you. Gorsh. Corsure for
[21533.53s -> 21538.49s]  the two or three dollars here. It's like you really want to wake up Sega and Shito. Stop yelling.
[21538.49s -> 21551.42s]  Well, the sake is not alive. She told us and then Corsure with another couple of dollars here. Here,
[21551.42s -> 21558.71s]  take my money. That's all my bits. I'm broke now. I hope that's not true. So I get, you know,
[21558.71s -> 21565.11s]  old 90s shows, but what about early and mid cartoons like Samurai, Samurai Jack, Danny Phantom,
[21565.91s -> 21570.81s]  Star Wars Clone Wars? It's actually pretty interesting that I have never seen
[21571.61s -> 21577.77s]  any of those. I've not seen Samurai Jack. I've not seen Danny Phantom. Well, I've seen it on the TV
[21577.77s -> 21585.53s]  accidentally flipping through and I've not watched the original Star Wars Clone Wars animated series.
[21586.33s -> 21594.81s]  I have not. Sorry. Hey, Rapid Wave, thanks for the five dollars. Captain Worgen, thanks for the one
[21594.81s -> 21608.17s]  dollar. There's an image here. It's another controller. Yes, I'm well aware that my drawing
[21608.17s -> 21624.15s]  of the controller looks like an enemy from Undertale. I get it, but it's okay. Thank you,
[21624.15s -> 21626.87s]  Captain Worgen. Thank you, Freudian Weapon for the one dollar. Just curious, what are your thoughts
[21626.87s -> 21633.34s]  on the new Spider-Man Far From Home trailer? I really don't know what to even think, because it
[21634.30s -> 21641.21s]  it seems like a lot going on. Spider-Man takes a trip to Europe. There's a water monster
[21642.58s -> 21652.34s]  that comes out and then Jake Gyllenhaal slams down with green acid around him and says,
[21652.34s -> 21665.34s]  get out of here, kids. I don't know. I mean, Homecoming was really well received and really
[21665.34s -> 21680.62s]  great, right? We'll have to see. What do you mean, no? Homecoming was very well received,
[21681.50s -> 21690.94s]  wasn't it? Thank you, Dorkcube for the one dollar. Jerma, yesterday, you sick fucks
[21691.82s -> 21699.54s]  stop. What? You sick fucks need to stop talking about farts. Jerma, today, I'm going to pee all
[21699.54s -> 21708.49s]  over the controller. Yeah, but I was saying that out of frustration. You weren't saying,
[21709.45s -> 21714.65s]  I, you were saying, I love this stream. I can't, you know what I mean? You, that was not out of
[21714.65s -> 21718.01s]  frustration. You were just saying it because you wanted to say that, because you thought it was
[21718.01s -> 21726.84s]  fun to say that. I didn't, I wasn't doing that having fun. I was going to piss on the controller
[21727.40s -> 21733.00s]  out of anger. It wasn't, I'm having so much fun. I'm going to pee on the controller.
[21733.56s -> 21742.18s]  You wouldn't do that. You'd only do that out of pure frustration. I'm not going to pee on
[21742.18s -> 21748.76s]  the controller. I'm just going to put it in the blender and put it on the ice crush setting.
[21749.56s -> 21762.01s]  We all, you know how powerful that is? The ice crush setting in your, that's more powerful than
[21763.82s -> 21776.10s]  a superhero. I don't know and tired. Thank you. Compact viewer for the $3. Wow. I joined at the
[21776.10s -> 21783.21s]  right fucking end. Late viewer, just at the end. Oh, you said that three hours ago was still here.
[21784.41s -> 21788.09s]  Was I going to end the stream three hours ago? Holy shit. Did I really get that mad?
[21788.81s -> 21792.98s]  All right. So if we got a scale here, I'm going to give you guys a scale.
[21794.20s -> 21803.05s]  Um, we've got personal, personal anger and annoyance, right? With like myself,
[21803.05s -> 21809.05s]  we got skate three kind of somewhere there. Where was this on the scale of like skate three to
[21809.05s -> 21818.33s]  hotline Miami two, you know, like skate three is angry. Actually, that's two different scales.
[21818.33s -> 21822.57s]  Let's go. What, what's like the best stream, like the most fun and relaxing stream I've ever done
[21822.57s -> 21845.56s]  Labo from Labo to a hotline Miami to where does this sit? Labo was not relaxing. This was a little
[21845.56s -> 21853.00s]  under Mario tennis. I don't know about that. I remember Mario tennis being actually truly angry
[21853.00s -> 21869.61s]  and being upset. Almost Mario tennis. No way this is near Mario tennis. Mario tennis was traumatizing.
[21870.33s -> 21886.15s]  Uh, that's live. That's live TV guys. There ain't no going back. I can't pretend like that never
[21886.15s -> 21892.95s]  happened. This is real live raw. Jeremy, I kid, what am I? I can't, I just, sometimes it happens.
[21902.71s -> 21912.12s]  I don't want to put on a face and pretend. No, I'm not capable. It's just me. But thank you,
[21912.12s -> 21917.08s]  Breen Bin for the $5. Congratulations on climbing the mountain. Hope you gain some pro gamer skills
[21917.08s -> 21922.55s]  along the way. Like an hour or two later, that might've been a debate there. Goose cap,
[21922.55s -> 21926.23s]  thanks for the $1. Hey, Jeremy, you're one of my favorite content creators and I love your streams.
[21926.23s -> 21932.31s]  Also, I made another baseball related green screen video that I actually saw this. I saw this,
[21932.31s -> 21943.22s]  didn't I? No, I didn't. Where's the one with this? The base is clearing. Let's watch this one.
[21943.78s -> 21952.25s]  No, but the Encore Knight, the Encore Knight. Oh, we're going to do this soon. Probably very soon.
[21955.45s -> 21961.05s]  These are, these are fucking funny and I'm not supposed to be doing this. I'm not supposed to
[21961.05s -> 21967.40s]  be showing green screen stuff. Hold on, hold on, hold on. There's another one of these that it has
[21967.40s -> 21988.38s]  a basis clearing fucking brawl and I was laughing my ass off at it. Ours is with an absolute rocket
[21988.38s -> 21996.54s]  into the Boston Knight and the Red Sox lead the series two games to none. That's it. They add back
[21996.54s -> 22016.02s]  the Red Sox has looked for. I love those. I did so many baseball swings and baseball things.
[22019.56s -> 22024.04s]  Show the other one. Where is it? Does somebody have the other one where there's a basis clearing
[22024.04s -> 22035.96s]  brawl? What gaming chair did you use for that home run? Uh, one I got, I got it from like
[22038.76s -> 22051.64s]  the store. I did the Ortiz Grand Slam also. Those are all so good, but thank you for that.
[22051.64s -> 22055.88s]  Thank you Goosecab. UltraLaven thanks for the one dollar. Although you did not stick
[22055.88s -> 22061.08s]  with the original title idea of what is inside the cube, I forgive you and wanted to actually
[22061.08s -> 22069.34s]  thank you for the incredible streams you provided me and countless others with. I try. I'm trying.
[22071.18s -> 22082.01s]  I hope it's fun. Thank you. Babby, Babbyty thanks for the 11 dollars. Do you think your Pac-Man
[22082.01s -> 22099.70s]  will come out of ranked retirement? It's possible. It's very possible. It's still,
[22099.70s -> 22106.26s]  I still have the, I don't have the actual, do I even have? I have the suit, but I don't think
[22106.26s -> 22114.46s]  I have the face. I don't, I think it might have gotten lost in the move, but thank you for the
[22114.46s -> 22121.70s]  11 dollars. Smellyboy thanks for one dollar. You should play Civ 6. I'm not sure I'm cut out for
[22121.70s -> 22129.48s]  that. Seems really interesting, but I'm not sure I'm capable. Demoniccucover thanks for the one
[22129.48s -> 22135.00s]  dollar. What's with the physics for scientists and engineers with modern physics joke? The cat,
[22135.64s -> 22148.46s]  the chat keeps making. I don't know. I, what is it? I didn't see it. Hey Superintendent Chalmers,
[22148.46s -> 22152.86s]  thanks for the two dollars. Hey Jerma, today's the 10th anniversary of Meet the Heavy,
[22152.86s -> 22157.90s]  which means 10 years without a Meet the Heavy Jerma dub. If you don't want to dub it and just
[22157.90s -> 22170.82s]  show it. And there's a gnome here. I'm not, I, I'm too, I'm too tired to do a dub right now.
[22179.99s -> 22197.78s]  No down under. What have we done as a society? You know what I mean? Think about that. This is a
[22197.78s -> 22206.49s]  clickable link. Do you understand guys? What's happening? This is a clickable, this is something
[22206.49s -> 22233.83s]  that, this is a link. You know, I, I, what's next? I can't believe that that's even possible to do.
[22234.55s -> 22243.51s]  The world has progressed so quickly. We just made up the TV like 60 or 70 years ago.
[22248.71s -> 22258.62s]  Color TV. And now people can sync the gnome to a song of their choosing.
[22265.42s -> 22270.98s]  That's truly unbelievable. Where are we going to be in 30 years?
[22271.70s -> 22278.38s]  Are they going to be flying gnomes in 30 years? Not even cars. We'll figure out how to fly gnomes
[22278.38s -> 22288.20s]  before the car takes off the ground. Thank you Amanda Requiem for the two dollars. Thank you.
[22289.83s -> 22294.39s]  Thank you Binko for the one dollar. Had to give you a dollar to tell you that there are golden
[22294.39s -> 22303.11s]  strawberries for completing a chapter without dying. And I have gotten 15 of them. Some for
[22303.11s -> 22307.35s]  A size, some for C size. Nonetheless, you've been making progress faster than I initially did.
[22308.15s -> 22317.86s]  So you're doing incredibly well. Thank you. That's, I don't know how you can do that. It's
[22318.82s -> 22331.11s]  I told you some of you guys have this alien video game IQ. It's like otherworldly how good
[22331.11s -> 22345.83s]  some of you guys are at these games. Otherworldly. Not even Earth. But thank you. That sounds really
[22345.83s -> 22351.32s]  intense and sounds like something I would probably never do. I do appreciate the fact that it's
[22351.32s -> 22360.14s]  available and I do respect the fact that people are capable of doing that. So cheers to that.
[22363.50s -> 22370.94s]  It's the funniest, what's this clip? It's the funniest, it's the funniest mechanic. It's the
[22370.94s -> 22384.55s]  best. What is this? It's this fun, really fun mechanic called stuff grows out after you touch
[22384.55s -> 22390.87s]  wall. It's the funnest fucking mechanic in the game. It's my favorite. Have I told you about my
[22390.87s -> 22405.51s]  favorite Tweety? It's the best. What are you, whoa, what is this?
[22415.91s -> 22423.26s]  Here's another one. To Lewicki, a couple of doubles last night. He's hit in 10 straight.
[22424.38s -> 22450.04s]  And it's a right back at Hosea. This is so good. These are
[22450.76s -> 22458.95s]  so good. These are actually so good.
[22482.38s -> 22495.70s]  Motherfucker did this shit. Imagine like the living shit post you would be if you tried to do this.
[22501.66s -> 22506.65s]  You guys are fucking too funny. What if it worked?
[22509.91s -> 22523.46s]  I'm so glad. You guys are so fucking funny. Hey ckluck, thank you for the one dollar.
[22524.02s -> 22531.34s]  German next, German next, German next, German next. When are we going to get the encore movie
[22531.34s -> 22540.14s]  night? Probably very soon. I want to give enough details. So there's like a week to kind of compile
[22540.14s -> 22547.34s]  them. Maybe a little bit more. Because the mods did so much last time. I'd like to give a lot of
[22547.34s -> 22557.96s]  time to make it work. But thank you. Demoniccucumber, thanks for the one dollar. Stream the cook food.
[22559.24s -> 22563.32s]  Oh that's right. I said like all I do is stream and then go cook food for 12 hours. I don't even
[22563.32s -> 22570.95s]  know what that meant. It was just steam coming out of my eyes. Something or Auder, thanks for
[22571.03s -> 22576.87s]  the one dollar. When you die on the toilet next week, can you leave me Shido in your will? Uh no,
[22576.87s -> 22584.46s]  sorry. Shido is going to be given the, Shido is going to be the, what's it called, the eulogy
[22586.10s -> 22610.89s]  at the funeral? The pallbearer? You can't hold the casket. Ckluck, again thanks for the one dollar.
[22610.89s -> 22615.93s]  If you have not pre-recorded a stream yet to play in like two years from now, referencing old jokes
[22615.93s -> 22621.05s]  and shit, you're missing an opportunity. Imagine you streaming like the launch build of No Man's
[22621.05s -> 22626.33s]  Sky and talking about like Germacraft and Rewind to Flanker and old stream jokes. It would be
[22626.33s -> 22636.20s]  amazing. I actually, there was something I was going to do a while ago where I was, it was going
[22636.20s -> 22645.46s]  to be too much, but it might have been worth it. I was going to pre-record like seven streams and
[22645.46s -> 22653.29s]  then just play them all back to back to back to back to back to back and go on vacation and see
[22653.29s -> 22662.42s]  if anybody figured it out. And put pictures on Twitter of being somewhere where I'm, where I'm,
[22662.98s -> 22673.19s]  it's very far away. Like how would I get back to my house and stream? Where even is he?
[22674.66s -> 22680.20s]  We would find out in two minutes. What if this is one of the streams I pre-recorded?
[22681.14s -> 22686.89s]  That's right, now you're thinking with portals. I've thought about it though, it just, that means
[22686.89s -> 22694.17s]  I have to do seven full live streams and not stream them. You know, I would have to turn on
[22694.17s -> 22713.19s]  a stream, but not actually broadcast it and just stream for like six hours. Think of the free time.
[22714.07s -> 22723.51s]  No, I've got lots of free time. I mean, I would consider myself busy. I try to keep up and try to
[22724.15s -> 22729.86s]  plan things and do things. And this is like a lot of like real life stuff that I, you know,
[22729.94s -> 22742.31s]  have to do. I stay fairly busy, but it's not like I have zero free time. Hey, yep, so thanks for the
[22742.31s -> 22745.59s]  four dollars. All jokes aside, please don't overwork yourself. I would hate to see you
[22745.59s -> 22751.00s]  have an early streamer burnout. You're my favorite internet boy. Please stay safe. I'm just fine.
[22753.40s -> 22759.90s]  Don't confuse, um, frustrated with video game with frustrated with live stream.
[22761.42s -> 22767.69s]  You know, that's, there's a two completely different things. Frustrated in playing video
[22767.69s -> 22785.66s]  game. It's nothing to do with it. Broadcasting stream. I'm not that that doesn't, I don't think
[22785.66s -> 22789.82s]  that's ever, I don't think that's happened. I'm not sure that actually that has happened.
[22792.92s -> 22798.60s]  I don't think I've ever gotten to a point where I've been like annoyed at the stream, like at
[22798.60s -> 22819.10s]  streaming or being live or being recorded or I'm not sure you don't have to put on a persona,
[22819.10s -> 22828.70s]  which really must make it easier. Um, yeah, I'm, I don't know if it's necessarily a persona thing
[22828.70s -> 22835.99s]  as much as it's look, I get pissed off at stuff all the time. I'm a fairly, I'm a fairly like
[22835.99s -> 22846.98s]  laid back person, but I can get red hot about random stuff and energized, right? But not at
[22848.50s -> 22851.70s]  I love streaming. I think it's one of, it's one of the most engaging, fun things.
[22853.10s -> 22860.46s]  It interests me every time. I'm not sure there's been, if it has, it's been very few times, if at
[22860.46s -> 22880.94s]  all. And I, you know, it, it happens. I can't tell you guys that I'm some perfect pinnacle of,
[22882.07s -> 22887.27s]  you know, collected, being collected all the time. I'm just like, I'm a person just like anybody else.
[22887.91s -> 22891.27s]  Sometimes I have a bad day. Sometimes I have really good days. Sometimes, you know, you got
[22891.27s -> 22896.82s]  a really, sometimes you have a bad stream. Sometimes you're off. It can happen. I'm not
[22896.82s -> 22902.87s]  going to pretend like it doesn't, right? Not like today. I mean, it's not like it was, that was today,
[22907.26s -> 22913.11s]  but it's, I'm not going to pretend like it's otherwise because pretending otherwise means
[22913.11s -> 22919.35s]  that I'm not like a person. Nope. Every single day we're having so much fun and every day is just
[22919.35s -> 22929.59s]  welcome to the stream. Like that's not, that's not reality. I didn't know that streamers were human.
[22934.97s -> 22937.61s]  That sounds so much better.
[22946.20s -> 22953.00s]  How, how quickly would people leave if I was like that every second? I don't think I would be able
[22953.00s -> 22962.39s]  to handle it. Do the YouTuber voice stream for six hours. I wouldn't be able to do that.
[22964.86s -> 22971.58s]  I almost left right there. All right. What's worse, being frustrated and dying a hundred
[22971.58s -> 22975.10s]  times at the same level and being angry and talking shit about like the clouds
[22975.10s -> 22983.06s]  or the YouTuber voice. I'm having tons of fun pretending. Which one? I feel like that's like
[22983.06s -> 22999.80s]  the opposite ends of the spectrum there. That's where my love of the stream comes from. You always
[22999.80s -> 23008.92s]  stay grounded. You always stay real because yeah, I, I, I don't know. It's, it's, it's hard to,
[23010.87s -> 23015.11s]  you can't put, I don't know if it's even possible, maybe for some people, but not for me.
[23015.35s -> 23020.55s]  I can't put on a fucking personality for seven straight hours. It's been six and a half hours,
[23021.35s -> 23045.21s]  right? At some point that becomes exhausting. Even more so than anything else, right? I'd be lying
[23045.21s -> 23050.17s]  if I said I didn't miss the old German 95 cut down edit styles of videos you did yourself,
[23050.17s -> 23059.51s]  but the stream is great. Yeah, but I, I don't think very much has changed. It's just the format has
[23061.32s -> 23080.31s]  in regards to how I go about doing things. I wanted to keep the same kind of energy level
[23081.03s -> 23086.47s]  and the same attitude that I had in my videos. Why? I mean, I made the videos the same way.
[23087.27s -> 23089.91s]  You want to know, here's the difference guys. Ready? You want to know the big difference
[23089.91s -> 23095.75s]  between making a YouTube video and streaming? You're, you're here watching me record the game.
[23097.10s -> 23100.86s]  That's really the only difference and I, and I'm not editing it afterwards.
[23102.15s -> 23106.63s]  I mean, they do get put into highlights and they do get edited down for a second German,
[23109.37s -> 23114.01s]  but if I was not streaming, let's say for instance, Celeste, right? If I wasn't not
[23114.01s -> 23118.73s]  streaming Celeste and I thought it would make a fun video, I would have just done what you just
[23118.73s -> 23128.78s]  watched, but it's almost easier now because there are people here that can react in real time
[23129.83s -> 23134.55s]  and can see it in real time and we can talk about it in real time. We can laugh about something in
[23134.55s -> 23140.04s]  real time. Somebody can say something that's really funny. Maybe I will say something and
[23140.04s -> 23143.88s]  then people react to it and we can go off from there. I, I love that back and forth.
[23144.76s -> 23151.38s]  The whole like treasure map thing earlier, that was, I loved that. That was a lot of fun.
[23152.18s -> 23167.64s]  That doesn't happen if I'm alone in the room recording by myself and the in-person skits.
[23168.46s -> 23174.23s]  I mean, those, those really haven't necessarily stopped either. Think of some of the streams
[23174.23s -> 23181.99s]  that I've done over the last six to 12 months that have had just kind of just skits, like jokes,
[23184.14s -> 23190.06s]  you know, like the lie detector, the dinner, even like the Christmas Eve stream, the New Year's
[23190.06s -> 23195.74s]  Eve stream. Those are all bits that took a while to set up. It wasn't like I just figured that out
[23195.74s -> 23213.48s]  and did that in one day. The lie detector was a joke? Well, I mean, the stream that I really did
[23213.56s -> 23221.18s]  that, I, that was a, I was really hooked up to a fucking lie detector, but that stream was a,
[23222.22s -> 23229.51s]  it was just for fun. It was just like a thing to do. That wasn't just, uh, it was, it was a skit.
[23229.51s -> 23234.31s]  It was a thing. It was like a comedy, right? It was, hey, I'm going to get this guy to come
[23234.31s -> 23253.78s]  and give me a lie detector test. Isn't that fun? He's a liar. Did the doctor watch the vaude?
[23254.66s -> 23267.24s]  Oh, Dr. Schmikeson. I feel like YouTube is harder because you have no one to interact with.
[23267.88s -> 23276.79s]  I do, I like, but I also love making videos. I do like it. I do. It's fun to do,
[23277.75s -> 23286.20s]  but it's hard to do them both because see, like, for instance, uh, I streamed for seven to eight
[23286.20s -> 23290.52s]  hours yesterday, wanted to take a break, got tired and, you know, ate some food and relaxed
[23290.52s -> 23294.92s]  and then went to bed. Kind of same thing like today, right? So another day goes by, here we are.
[23296.04s -> 23300.36s]  Six, seven hours go by, you know, I want to get food and relaxed. I don't really want to go like
[23300.36s -> 23308.22s]  make a video after that, you know, after sitting and doing stuff for six, seven, eight, sometimes
[23308.22s -> 23315.10s]  10 plus hours. The next day, if I'm going to take a day off is a lot of it is what I want to do for
[23315.10s -> 23319.50s]  the stream coming up. What are there any upcoming streams that I want to try to start working on?
[23319.50s -> 23324.23s]  Is there anything fun that I want to try to get ready? It kind of takes up a majority of the time.
[23325.11s -> 23336.52s]  Plus without like, we've talked about the YouTube changes and all the, um, now YouTube has kind of
[23336.52s -> 23347.06s]  ran itself into the ground over the last couple of years anyways, but we'll move on. Not to go
[23347.06s -> 23360.65s]  down that rabbit hole again, but that was Yepso for four dollars talking about don't overwork
[23360.65s -> 23368.87s]  yourself. I'm not. Don't worry about me. And again, I'm going to reiterate that one more time.
[23369.93s -> 23378.33s]  Uh, don't take frustrating video game and back and forth kind of jokey banter with the chat with
[23379.13s -> 23382.81s]  I'm not having a good time streaming. They're very different things.
[23382.81s -> 23390.31s]  Just want to make sure that's very, very clear. Uh, thank you to CK luck again for the one dollar.
[23390.95s -> 23395.51s]  Hey, German, if someone managed to acquire a sample of your DNA and cloned you, do you,
[23396.47s -> 23410.49s]  we already went over that. No, I, someone, some with, uh, you're asking like, all right. Um, thank
[23410.49s -> 23415.69s]  you. Future gamer for the two dollars. So in like five years, what will your acceptance speech for
[23415.69s -> 23428.41s]  the number one top streamer on Twitch award be? You know what it'd be? This is not my award. I want
[23428.41s -> 23442.12s]  to give this to chat because they're the reason why I'm here. And I would donate it, melt the
[23442.20s -> 23455.70s]  fucking gold down and donate it. And then I would laugh my ass off and be like, I'm just gonna get
[23455.70s -> 23462.76s]  this. It's mine. Chat sucks. Chat sucks. Chat sucks. And I would get a whole, the whole audience would
[23462.76s -> 23471.50s]  be chanting. I would just, I would, I would just start fucking screaming it. They would cut to
[23471.50s -> 23477.58s]  George Clooney in the audience and be like, chat sucks. Chat sucks. Like a huge smile on his face.
[23478.54s -> 23484.22s]  And I walked down the Island. Every single fucking row is high-fiving me. Every single one.
[23489.96s -> 23494.60s]  And then you wake up from your fucking nightmare. Why I fell asleep at the award show because all
[23494.60s -> 23499.40s]  award shows are fucking boring and horrible with this stupid. Oh no, he's doing his acceptance
[23499.40s -> 23514.74s]  speech. And I would, and what would happen is I would give it to chat. Hey, future gamer. Thanks
[23514.74s -> 23525.66s]  for the two dollars. That was you. Hey bro luck. Thanks. We have to stop the future. The premonition
[23525.66s -> 23534.73s]  that we saw. Oh my God. Thank you bro luck for the one dollar. What's your political opinion on
[23534.73s -> 23547.58s]  politics? That's what I think. Hey compact viewer. Thanks for the one dollar. Thanks for another
[23547.58s -> 23556.30s]  great stream as always. Keep cranking out the good content. Dash a fan. Thank you. Thank you compact
[23556.30s -> 23560.86s]  viewer. Thank you Tingy for the one dollar. Thank you Sticks Renegade for the one dollar. Thank you
[23560.86s -> 23565.74s]  Corsure for the one dollar. Turns out I still had one more dollar. So a quick question. Do you still
[23565.74s -> 23574.47s]  use your steam community or no? No, not at all. Steam community is going the same route as the
[23574.47s -> 23583.34s]  Facebook, which is it may become auto-deleted because I have not touched it. That's where we
[23583.34s -> 23588.38s]  are right now. Facebook might get auto-deleted because I haven't logged in in like fucking two
[23588.38s -> 23593.34s]  years. The steam group auto-deleted because I haven't used it in two, I have no idea.
[23598.74s -> 23602.34s]  I came to this realization real quick that I don't do social media. I don't use it.
[23605.38s -> 23610.74s]  I don't have... and it's not because... oh I know here come the boomer
[23610.74s -> 23617.18s]  emotes right? It has nothing to do with that. I just don't... I don't have much to say on those
[23617.18s -> 23628.82s]  platforms. You know, I don't have very much to say. Talking about maybe a stream change or a
[23629.86s -> 23635.14s]  schedule announcement or a stream announcement or something that I thought was interesting
[23635.14s -> 23640.98s]  once in a while. But I'm not gonna tweet you guys like a selfie of me eating like a
[23640.98s -> 23648.95s]  fucking hamburger or something. What the hell? Why would I do that? What am I like looking for
[23648.95s -> 23655.43s]  likes or retweets or something? What's the point of that? You know, I just don't do the social media
[23655.43s -> 23666.02s]  thing. I never did and I still really don't. Why not? We want that. Do it. I want that. Do it.
[23668.36s -> 23679.48s]  I would enjoy seeing you enjoy a burger. All right. You ready for me to get real? Uh oh.
[23680.84s -> 23699.82s]  Uh oh. Uh oh. You want your privacy. I mean it's kind of a privacy thing because
[23701.14s -> 23708.18s]  you know, not everything has to be shared. We're in this kind of weird mode where everything has
[23708.18s -> 23712.97s]  to be shared and you have to share everything with everybody. This is what I did. This is where I went.
[23712.97s -> 23716.09s]  This is what I ate. This is what I did today. This is what I'm doing tomorrow. This is what
[23716.09s -> 23730.79s]  I did right now. Just a constant stream of sharing everything. It's weird how it's now kind of nice
[23731.88s -> 23746.84s]  to not share something. That's kind of the other way around 10, 20 years ago. You told everyone
[23746.84s -> 23763.42s]  you pee in the shower. On Twitter? When did I do that? He's keeping secrets from us. No.
[23764.38s -> 23770.30s]  And like another thing too is like let's say for instance, right? If I was going somewhere,
[23770.30s -> 23778.23s]  I was doing something. I think part of me, if I'm doing something like really, really fun or
[23778.23s -> 23783.91s]  something really cool. Hey guys, look at how cool I am. Look at the cool thing I'm doing right now.
[23783.91s -> 23790.78s]  You're not doing that. It's like, I think part of me is just like, I don't, I don't really like want
[23790.86s -> 23797.96s]  to share it. Oh, look at how awesome this is. Don't you think I'm awesome? And I know that's
[23797.96s -> 23801.96s]  not what a ton of people think when they're posting on social media, but I just, it itches
[23801.96s -> 23817.51s]  in the back of my head. It really is like a look at me sometimes. All I want is a selfie with your
[23817.51s -> 23840.25s]  big Mac. Streamer has lice. If it's so cool, why are you worrying about posting? People like seeing
[23840.25s -> 23852.92s]  people they care about succeed. Yeah, no, I get it. It's, I just don't, it's, I don't want to like
[23853.48s -> 23867.34s]  brag to you guys for something. I just, I find it unnecessary. Succeeding in eating a burger.
[23877.59s -> 23885.51s]  Jeremy's withholding all of his cool shit from us. And that's part two. Uh oh, are we still live?
[23885.59s -> 23893.96s]  Yeah. Uh, that's part two. I don't, uh, I don't do very much cool shit.
[23895.38s -> 23899.78s]  It's, you know what I mean? It's not like I'm, oh, by the way, today I'm here. And then tomorrow,
[23899.78s -> 23904.18s]  look at me, I'm on top of a mountain. And hey, look at me, look at this. Look where I am. Oh,
[23904.18s -> 23915.98s]  I'm at the premiere of this movie. I don't, what? Have I tweeted every day? Three, four, five times
[23915.98s -> 23933.05s]  a day. I'd be like on the couch sitting there like watching TV. Upload the same photo of you
[23933.05s -> 23940.76s]  on your couch every day as a new tweet and just give it a different tagline. Like, hey, I'm checking
[23940.76s -> 23949.27s]  out the new Star Wars premiere. And it's me on the couch. Dude, I found the sickest restaurant
[23949.27s -> 23970.95s]  in Vegas. I'm here at blah, blah, blah. And it's the same picture. And one of them is just hanging
[23970.95s -> 23974.63s]  out on the couch, taking a little snooze day. You know what I mean? Hashtag snooze day. And it's,
[23974.63s -> 23992.89s]  that's the, that's the correct tweet. That's going to be like eight tweets later though.
[23992.89s -> 24000.58s]  You better do this. I'm getting myself in fucking trouble. I'm going to tweet out about how I met
[24000.58s -> 24005.54s]  the Star Wars premiere and like Disney's going to send a message like we are in no way affiliated
[24005.54s -> 24020.06s]  with German 985. He was not invited to the red carpet premiere. Wait, are we, am I still live?
[24020.06s -> 24034.81s]  Yeah, we're getting some bad frame bullshit. Late night cocks problems. That's true. Thank you. I
[24034.81s -> 24041.45s]  am monk for the one dollar. Uh, say Tupac, you know, like the rapper. Good. Now say Topac. See
[24041.45s -> 24061.19s]  what you're doing wrong. Thank you. I am month. And, uh, thanks for the a hundred dollars core
[24062.46s -> 24068.92s]  Cormac McCarthy. They gave a hundred bucks and there's no message, just a shitload of bits,
[24068.92s -> 24087.62s]  a ton of them. Thank you so much for the a hundred dollars, 10,000 bits. Really appreciate it. Thank
[24087.62s -> 24106.54s]  you. It's a lot of fucking money. There's a grill master imposter in chat. Read the message that
[24106.54s -> 24114.81s]  no, this, there's no message. Just cheer 10,000. There's no message here. Thank you. You are too
[24114.81s -> 24124.36s]  kind to me. Seriously. Bring back the schedule. I'm not going to bring back the schedule.
[24126.54s -> 24136.50s]  We're getting more streams more often and it's able, it gives me a lot of opportunity to change
[24137.46s -> 24145.51s]  each week to exactly how I want the week to go. Sorry. We're going schedule list for a while.
[24146.15s -> 24157.98s]  They may even be scheduled as permanently your tone. Whenever you get big bits,
[24157.98s -> 24170.90s]  it's like you're addressing someone whose dog just died. I, it's a very grounding,
[24170.90s -> 24177.03s]  like humbling thing. Somebody just gave me a hundred dollars. You know what I mean? It's like,
[24177.03s -> 24187.51s]  I, I don't know how to react. It's, it's a lot. I mean, could I be like a hundred dollars?
[24187.99s -> 24205.99s]  Whoa, what the fuck? Hey, yeah. But I think that's, I feel like that's, that's not as genuine
[24205.99s -> 24212.25s]  as how I would really react, really react to it. And it's, I'm shocked. I'm floored. I'm surprised.
[24212.25s -> 24217.88s]  I can't, when it happens, when people give a hundred dollars, $50. Thank you. I don't,
[24217.88s -> 24222.20s]  I don't really have a reaction. I don't know how to react because it's a lot of money.
[24226.79s -> 24229.19s]  Someone take that out of context and make him look terrible.
[24234.68s -> 24244.52s]  Brag about the hundred dollars on Twitter, on the couch, in the same selfie. You should dance for
[24244.52s -> 24253.62s]  it. No, because I don't want to give incentives for it. If I, okay, if I, here, listen. Oh, how
[24253.62s -> 24258.54s]  come you don't like make a huge deal when somebody gives like a bunch of money? Because then that,
[24258.54s -> 24264.70s]  that incentivizes, oh, if I give him a hundred dollars, he's going to do a Fortnite dance on
[24264.78s -> 24269.70s]  camera. You know, I want that to be genuine. I don't want that to be something that people
[24269.70s -> 24274.82s]  are paying for because they know they're going to get something. I think I'm going to do something
[24274.82s -> 24293.78s]  crazy, right? Because then if that would happen, let's say I said, this is by the way, this is not
[24293.78s -> 24305.26s]  fucking real. I'm just saying this as a character in my own TV show. Okay. If I were to say for the
[24305.26s -> 24312.06s]  next 30 minutes, if I get a hundred dollar donation, I will dance like crazy on stream.
[24312.70s -> 24317.02s]  It would probably happen. It would probably happen at least a few times at least.
[24318.57s -> 24323.83s]  I don't want to like tell people to donate, to give money. I don't want to tell you to do that
[24323.83s -> 24328.87s]  because it's, that's your decision. It should be something that you make your decision that just,
[24329.59s -> 24334.15s]  words are difficult is what I'm trying to say. It's hard to say words, especially in a sentence.
[24334.79s -> 24352.54s]  Any news on merchandise? Yes. I just talked to Ashley and we're in the final home stretch
[24353.51s -> 24365.69s]  of little final tweaks for the new shirt. There'll be two shirts to purchase very soon. Hey,
[24365.69s -> 24372.68s]  you know what a Twitch Prime sub is? You should use it. That's your decision. If you feel like
[24372.68s -> 24377.72s]  subbing to this channel, I hope you think it's worth it. I'm not going to tell you to,
[24377.72s -> 24383.24s]  I'm not going to remind you to, I'm not going to make it a point to make sure you're aware
[24383.24s -> 24388.44s]  that you have the opportunity to pay me. That's your choice. That's your decision.
[24396.38s -> 24399.66s]  Did the shirts have a genuine German smell? Yeah, I roll around in all of them.
[24401.45s -> 24404.57s]  Let's say there's like a thousand shirt sales. I'm going to throw them all in a pile. I'm just
[24404.57s -> 24411.56s]  going to roll around in them, but here's the real kicker. I'm going to cover myself in disgusting
[24411.56s -> 24421.42s]  old man cologne. So the shirts are going to be unwearable. All right, let's get to the end here.
[24429.46s -> 24436.01s]  Where were we? Brawluc, thanks for the one dollar. Please revisit this game. It was so good.
[24440.89s -> 24444.01s]  Demoniccucumber, thanks for the one dollar. You should do a Shito cam
[24444.65s -> 24448.41s]  that you turn on to tuck Shito into his bed at the end of every stream.
[24449.21s -> 24453.21s]  By the way, you haven't told him his story yet. We'd like to hear that. Now that's off. That's
[24453.21s -> 24461.96s]  me. That's between me and my son. Sorry. Started to share everything on social media. Case in point.
[24462.76s -> 24467.42s]  Thank you, Clueless Sniper for the one dollar. Will Shito be in the next German rumble?
[24467.42s -> 24473.26s]  100% absolutely guaranteed, yes. Klosky, thanks for the five dollars, Klosky.
[24474.66s -> 24482.34s]  Put this on black for me, okay? The next time I find myself in a casino, I will put five dollars
[24482.34s -> 24492.23s]  on black just for you. Thank you, Lula, for the five dollars. I know it might be weird when people
[24492.23s -> 24497.19s]  send you messages about being depressed and you helping them, but it's true. My dad has been in
[24497.19s -> 24501.67s]  the hospital for the last few weeks and I've been in a dark place, but your streams have really made
[24501.67s -> 24507.27s]  an impact in my days and I always look forward to them. I know you think you're silly, but you're
[24507.27s -> 24511.67s]  doing a good thing here. Keep it up. You're my favorite streamer because you're silly real.
[24515.00s -> 24526.71s]  I'm really sorry to hear about your father. That sucks. That can't be fucking easy. I wish
[24526.71s -> 24538.41s]  nothing but the best for your dad and I'm absolutely, absolutely honored that you have
[24538.49s -> 24558.30s]  that kind of stuff to say about me and my stream. Seriously. Hopefully it's nothing serious.
[24558.30s -> 24566.97s]  Hopefully your father has a swift recovery. I'm really sorry to hear that. Thank you so much
[24566.97s -> 24574.38s]  for being part of this community. Thank you so much for the five dollars. Much love to you, for real.
[24577.35s -> 24590.55s]  Thank you. Look at those hearts in the chat. That's what I like to see. I like to see that.
[24591.35s -> 24599.35s]  PeacefulHaley, thanks for the one dollar. Have you ever drank apple cider or vinegar?
[24600.07s -> 24603.51s]  I had to drink that one time because my stomach was fucked up and that stuff is
[24603.51s -> 24610.23s]  poison. Never again. Apple cider vinegar is actually, it's pretty good for you.
[24611.70s -> 24621.19s]  I wouldn't drink it straight, but it has some health benefits. It's also a decent salad dressing.
[24628.49s -> 24632.65s]  I've had it before in various things. Demoniccucumber, thanks for the one dollar.
[24632.65s -> 24637.21s]  Hey Jeremy, I was watching last night's VOD and when I went downstairs I thought that reality was
[24637.21s -> 24642.97s]  a VOD and that I could pause and I also keep forgetting this is live. I think I've had a
[24642.97s -> 24653.98s]  minor breakdown. Either that or I need some sleep. Either way, mind how you go, man. I told you guys
[24653.98s -> 24660.06s]  about how I used to play so much Diablo 2 that Diablo 2 sound effects would wake me up in the
[24660.06s -> 24668.12s]  middle of the night and I could hear them. That like, I would hear that and it would wake me up.
[24668.68s -> 24678.65s]  What happened? Did something drop on there? Loop drop? I can relate. Hey compact viewer,
[24678.65s -> 24682.25s]  thanks for the one dollar. Watch both Star Wars Clone Wars cartoons. They are great,
[24682.25s -> 24689.69s]  especially with Clone Wars coming back this year. I have heard that sounds great and it does include
[24689.69s -> 24695.29s]  my favorite Star Wars character. Do you guys know who that is? Do you guys know who my favorite Star
[24695.29s -> 24708.55s]  Wars character is? I'm not sure I've ever talked about this. It is not Chewie. Yeah, yeah I could
[24708.55s -> 24717.96s]  got it. This is General Grievous. Jar Jar? No, it's General Grievous is my favorite Star Wars
[24717.96s -> 24733.42s]  character. You're a nerd. I'll tell you a quick story before we move on. I went to the land of
[24733.42s -> 24739.11s]  Disney. Disneyland for those of you that can't really keep up and follow. I went to Disneyland.
[24739.83s -> 24746.36s]  Disney, yeah Disney World actually. The world of Disney and that was right after the acquisition
[24747.08s -> 24751.32s]  and they bought everything and they had you know if you wanted to have something Star Wars related
[24751.32s -> 24757.32s]  there were a bunch of gift shops, tons of shit everywhere. Oh you couldn't you couldn't sneeze
[24757.32s -> 24763.48s]  without looking in a direction and seeing another shop that had figures and clothes of every single
[24763.48s -> 24771.72s]  potential Star Wars movie ever, right? So I walk into one of the 500,000 gift shops and I'm looking
[24771.72s -> 24778.25s]  around for a Grievous, a General Grievous action figure. I'm gonna make like a little statue like
[24778.25s -> 24782.65s]  maybe six, seven inch statue of Grievous. And so what? I can't get it anywhere else. Where am I
[24782.65s -> 24788.09s]  gonna get this? This is the perfect place to get it. I'm not, I shit you not. I had to go and ask
[24788.09s -> 24794.31s]  somebody behind the counter and they didn't even know who the fuck I was talking about. I was like
[24794.31s -> 24799.75s]  do you guys have like any Grievous stuff? Like a t-shirt or a clothes or a figurine or something?
[24800.71s -> 24808.09s]  General Grievous. Who? General Grievous. He pulled up a radio.
[24810.25s -> 24814.09s]  I didn't even hear what he said. Somebody else came down and they were they actually
[24814.09s -> 24817.93s]  couldn't figure out who I was talking about. Finally they said is that prequel thing?
[24817.93s -> 24822.97s]  Yeah he's one of the the villains from the prequels. Well you know I don't want to have like any prequel
[24822.97s -> 24833.56s]  stuff. And that but that was a lie because there was like podracers and stuff. How do you not have
[24833.56s -> 24844.65s]  a General Grievous t-shirt at the HQ of Star Wars? And I looked it up and it's actually they
[24844.65s -> 24851.30s]  they never made any. I think there was some toys but I'm talking like a real one of those
[24852.26s -> 24856.10s]  figures that are like as if you bought a collector's edition for a video game.
[24856.74s -> 24875.02s]  The gift shop is fucked. They have to have made something. I don't think they did. The guy told
[24875.02s -> 24883.51s]  me that they didn't have anything and I was like what? What? General Garfield. Count Dooku is better
[24883.51s -> 24889.91s]  than General Grievous. Well Count Dooku trained General Grievous so they're best friends. You
[24889.91s -> 24900.44s]  don't want to have the second part of that team. They're not toys mom. They're figures.
[24902.41s -> 24911.58s]  I wanted it made out of pewter. Yeah that was surprising to me because General Grievous was
[24911.58s -> 24918.63s]  a really popular character. I know he's very prominent in the Clone Wars and he's he just got
[24918.71s -> 24923.75s]  released into Battlefront 2 right? Like where? Give me a Grievous t-shirt. Give it to me.
[24928.01s -> 24933.61s]  The only reason why I ever considered downloading Battlefront 2 was just because they just added
[24933.61s -> 24948.98s]  General Grievous. But I digress. TLDW. Too long didn't watch. I went to Star Wars headquarters
[24950.71s -> 24955.53s]  in Florida and they didn't have a General Grievous piece of merchandise.
[24959.67s -> 24962.95s]  Uh but thank you Corsure again for the one dollar. I just borrowed
[24963.99s -> 24971.06s]  my sister's gift card and Sega are I mean Machines Sega are alive. I mean
[24971.06s -> 24980.57s]  Explain Detroit Become Human. Don't steal anything from anybody. That's not good. No stealing. Don't
[24980.57s -> 24993.06s]  steal things. Hey yes Vess is online. Thanks for the two dollars. Missed part of the stream
[24993.06s -> 24997.54s]  because of my terrible sleep schedule but that controller complaint is a big meme in fighting
[24997.54s -> 25012.44s]  games. Here's a link of a list called Scrub Lords. Scrub Lords. I like to call this the
[25012.44s -> 25016.84s]  Scrub Lords prayer which goes like this. My controls weren't working and if they were you
[25016.84s -> 25021.56s]  were playing dishonorably and if you weren't you were playing without skill and if you were
[25021.56s -> 25026.68s]  it's not fun to play that way and if it is then you only care about winning. We know all of this
[25026.68s -> 25030.92s]  is nonsense because Guy just doesn't know how to block. Of course it's easy to roll your eyes.
[25031.88s -> 25046.70s]  I know what I know and I know that I pressed up and right at the same time and dashed and didn't
[25046.70s -> 25056.33s]  work. I know what I know. I didn't say any prayers. Thank you Garfield the Monday Killer for the one
[25056.33s -> 25063.21s]  dollar. Please rise chat it's time for a touching speech written by Sam Eagle. Dermot Sam Eagle
[25063.21s -> 25068.89s]  isn't actually here. I promised he'd be here at the event but he got delayed by cartoon traffic
[25069.05s -> 25075.85s]  chomp. To your best Sam Eagle impression to fool the audience I wonder how many phrases
[25076.57s -> 25083.77s]  he might do like two or three words or one sound before sighing under his breath and giving up.
[25084.41s -> 25092.17s]  If he does do it I'll eat my shoe. Time for a funny Garf joke. Celeste more like a mess.
[25092.73s -> 25106.97s]  Was the game good? I just tuned in. The game was great. Those b-tapes though.
[25108.82s -> 25116.50s]  Oh you know what I mean? Hard. Thank you I'm Vinny JK for the one dollar. When will you play
[25116.50s -> 25130.02s]  Mountain Blade? Maybe one day. Timmy Tim Tam thanks for the one dollar. Are Shito and Otto
[25130.02s -> 25138.84s]  best friends? No they don't really get along. Otto doesn't like the way that he talks. Hey mostly

[25161.75s -> 25172.20s]  been giving me inspiration recently. Oh look at little Shito. I think I would want a Shito
[25172.20s -> 25183.51s]  emote to be a real picture. Can you draw my OC drama? No I can't. I don't know how to draw
[25184.23s -> 25199.72s]  but thank you Dorkcube. Thank you. Issu- is this backwards? Issu-bet. Issu-a-bet for the two dollars

[25284.06s -> 25289.50s]  on Twitter. We talked about it. No I don't want to do that. No we're not gonna do that. It's your
[25289.50s -> 25294.86s]  decision. It's your choice. If you want to give me money I'm grateful for it. We don't have to have
[25294.86s -> 25301.67s]  like incentives for it. If you thought it was worth paying for then sure. I'm not- I'm not
[25301.67s -> 25306.94s]  gonna stop you. Kisco thanks for the one dollar. Write my name on the short whiteboard behind you.

[25325.96s -> 25332.47s]  I've asked. I've called the post office like 30 times. Where is this stuff? I'm sorry Mr.
[25332.47s -> 25336.95s]  Albertson but it went back and forth from the factory back to the factory back to the original
[25336.95s -> 25342.31s]  factory and I'm like this is ridiculous. This is absolutely ridiculous. Can I talk to your manager
[25342.31s -> 25347.27s]  please? This is ridiculous. So hey this is the manager on the post office. Let me let me tell
[25347.27s -> 25353.35s]  you something. This is the last time you're gonna lose this. I'm gonna call- I'm gonna call the FTC
[25353.35s -> 25357.11s]  on you. I'm gonna call the Better Business Bureau and they're gonna figure this out.
[25357.83s -> 25363.19s]  Unbelievable. I'm sorry Mr. Albertson we have no idea where it went back to the- I think it went
[25363.19s -> 25378.89s]  back to the factory. Unbelievable. Hey thank you Bruce Lee for the one dollar we told you to donate

[25387.64s -> 25391.96s]  that was another thing. When I ordered I had to call that store. They messed up the order like 10
[25391.96s -> 25404.10s]  times. Somehow the food was on there. I called them. Like this is unbelievable. Why is there-
[25405.27s -> 25410.89s]  why is there an order of cocktail shrimp on here? You better be careful. I'm gonna call the FTC on
