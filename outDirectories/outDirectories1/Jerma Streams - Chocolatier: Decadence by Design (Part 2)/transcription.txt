[1.46s -> 5.86s]  PlayStation stream? Go to the PlayStation? PlayStation Direct?
[5.86s -> 10.47s]  No, no, no. No, I'm not- I'm not watchin' another Direct.
[11.46s -> 14.66s]  The last one disappointed me. I'm not- What? For me to learn what?
[15.78s -> 17.08s]  What are we gonna learn on this Direct?
[18.77s -> 24.60s]  PlayStation Direct. PlayStation Direct.
[25.43s -> 27.43s]  It actually is called PlayStation Direct.
[31.30s -> 33.20s]  Play the- PlayStation Direct.
[34.26s -> 35.86s]  No, this is like a shipping company.
[37.56s -> 39.20s]  Wait, PlayStation Direct.
[40.14s -> 43.84s]  Limited time only. Free shipping on your entire order with any accessories.
[43.84s -> 45.24s]  Purchase of $60 or more.
[47.56s -> 49.56s]  Must meet order threshold of $60.
[50.92s -> 53.02s]  Some customers may be affected by- Oh, okay.
[55.15s -> 55.65s]  Watch it.
[56.35s -> 58.75s]  No, I'm not gonna- I don't wanna watch the PlayStation.
[58.75s -> 61.15s]  Okay, when did it start? When did it start?
[66.50s -> 69.20s]  30 minutes ago? Alright. And how long is it gonna go?
[69.20s -> 70.70s]  You give me updates, okay?
[73.96s -> 79.96s]  When the Ratchet and Clank IRL movie comes out, you just let me know when they announce it.
[85.25s -> 86.65s]  I'm not watchin' another Direct.
[87.35s -> 88.95s]  Not unless it's the one I wanna watch.
[92.05s -> 92.95s]  And no more of those.
[95.20s -> 96.20s]  It just ended.
[97.24s -> 98.10s]  You haven't missed anything?
[99.81s -> 102.37s]  It ended when you started. Oh, so you've just fucked with me, okay.
[105.97s -> 107.31s]  It was a Crash Bandicoot.
[109.60s -> 110.10s]  Yeah.
[110.99s -> 113.99s]  It's prob- They're gonna keep- They'll keep making Crash Bandicoot.
[116.86s -> 118.46s]  I never was concerned they wouldn't do it.
[122.64s -> 125.20s]  Ever since they did the- The Insane Trilogy.
[126.49s -> 127.83s]  Come on, of course they're gonna do another one.
[130.65s -> 131.35s]  Elden Ring?
[135.56s -> 138.22s]  No, there was the- Hold on. Was there an Elden Ring thing?
[139.30s -> 140.70s]  What has it been on the PlayStation one?
[143.25s -> 146.31s]  Elden Ring leaks posted by impatient fans.
[147.58s -> 150.08s]  Ha ha ha. Are fake, okay.
[151.90s -> 153.86s]  Elden Ring Insider shares update.
[154.66s -> 155.16s]  Okay.
[156.28s -> 157.28s]  That's- That's not real.
[163.15s -> 163.65s]  Whatever.
[164.68s -> 165.98s]  You tell me what happens.
[168.23s -> 172.73s]  You know, sitting there for 60 minutes with my fingers in my mouth just biting my fingernails, are they gonna announce?
[173.13s -> 175.93s]  Are they gonna announce Super Street Fighter VII?
[176.73s -> 178.03s]  No, I can read it in a tweet.
[178.93s -> 179.43s]  Five minutes.
[179.93s -> 180.63s]  After the thing's over.
[182.00s -> 182.90s]  I'd rather relax.
[183.70s -> 186.20s]  And just like, make chocolates and then- Oh, wait a minute.
[186.90s -> 188.50s]  Elden Ring has an announcement?
[189.30s -> 189.80s]  Date?
[190.50s -> 192.70s]  Oh, okay. I can be in the bathtub and read that.
[194.16s -> 195.46s]  That's too much. Too much stress.
[198.61s -> 202.61s]  I'd lived through that. I did that shit. I'd lived through that and I don't want to live through that again.
[204.10s -> 206.60s]  I remember Super Smash Bros. Brawl.
[207.30s -> 210.30s]  Sakurai would do weekly Friday updates.
[211.69s -> 214.79s]  Announcing a new character or a new thing that was in the game.
[215.39s -> 216.39s]  And that was what you did.
[216.59s -> 218.19s]  It was at three o'clock in the morning.
[219.09s -> 220.39s]  And it was all I cared about.
[220.89s -> 221.99s]  Oh my god, is this the day?
[222.29s -> 224.99s]  Are they gonna- Is- Oh my god, is Donkey Kong in this one?
[225.99s -> 228.39s]  It consumed like four months of my life.
[229.66s -> 230.36s]  And then I played-
[231.26s -> 232.86s]  I played Brawl for probably a total of-
[233.76s -> 235.26s]  Oh, no, no, no. That's the one I played a lot of.
[235.76s -> 236.66s]  Yeah, that was worth it.
[243.00s -> 247.60s]  It's so funny because Brawl is the one that I put all the time into and it's the one that everybody says is the worst one.
[250.27s -> 251.47s]  Right? By a lot.
[252.27s -> 253.07s]  I thought it was fun.
[253.67s -> 256.67s]  But I know that most people say that that's the absolute worst one.
[258.44s -> 259.44s]  It's the one I actually played.
[262.17s -> 263.27s]  Meta Knight was in the game.
[263.27s -> 264.77s]  Oh, yeah. I remember people playing Meta Knight.
[265.57s -> 268.87s]  They just turned into the drill and just flew around and just won every single match.
[269.77s -> 270.27s]  I remember that.
[273.90s -> 275.40s]  Brawl was the best casual one.
[275.40s -> 276.20s]  Yeah, I mean, it was fun.
[277.00s -> 278.40s]  I- That's the one I put all the time into.
[286.84s -> 288.64s]  Why don't you stream the awful PlayStation Direct?
[288.64s -> 290.74s]  I'm not- No, we're not doing that.
[293.45s -> 295.15s]  We are gonna- I'm gonna just change the camera because-
[295.15s -> 297.05s]  Wait, I didn't even tweet this. I'm not even here. I'll be right back.
[375.81s -> 377.31s]  This shit ended an hour ago.
[378.02s -> 381.22s]  You liars. This ended like a full hour ago.
[382.79s -> 385.99s]  I'm sitting here being like, eh, maybe I should stream this. Eh, maybe it's almost-
[385.99s -> 387.39s]  Maybe there'll be an announcement at the end.
[387.39s -> 389.79s]  There's nothing on here. It was- This was like over.
[390.43s -> 391.73s]  It ended seven minutes ago.
[391.73s -> 395.93s]  Well, then look. Then, good, it was fu- It was good I didn't stream it.
[396.23s -> 400.17s]  Because guess what? I don't see anybody talking about anything in this Direct.
[402.79s -> 405.29s]  I've seen like two things that people thought was cool.
[407.22s -> 409.62s]  I would've- It would've been spammed if something huge was announced.
[411.10s -> 412.80s]  So, what? Whatever.
[412.80s -> 416.60s]  Alright, I'm ready. I didn't- I didn't- I didn't even tweet anything. I'll be right back.
[433.32s -> 438.42s]  Do I not know how to spell chocolate so badly that my iPhone thought I was trying to say cholesterol?
[442.31s -> 445.61s]  How do you spell- It's choc- col- choc-o-late, right?
[446.67s -> 448.37s]  Choc-o-late.
[449.62s -> 450.42s]  Factory.
[451.81s -> 452.71s]  Entrepreneur.
[456.36s -> 457.16s]  Holy shit.
[457.46s -> 458.96s]  Chocolate. Fav-tory.
[459.36s -> 461.36s]  Entree-an-or-near.
[462.16s -> 464.16s]  I can't type. I hate these fucking things.
[464.46s -> 465.46s]  I hate phones.
[465.96s -> 467.56s]  I hate them. I don't want them anymore.
[467.56s -> 468.86s]  I don't want to use this phone anymore.
[468.86s -> 470.76s]  Fucking try- Get me by goddamn-
[472.70s -> 473.70s]  Send to Telegram.
[481.44s -> 483.94s]  I'm gonna give you guys a stream notification by Telegram.
[488.81s -> 490.21s]  Alright, hold on. I'm almost ready.
[492.39s -> 493.79s]  PlayStation Direct.
[498.50s -> 500.80s]  You- I- I can't- Dude, what would- What- Okay.
[500.80s -> 504.40s]  What do you think would happen if Super Mario was announced for PlayStation?
[505.68s -> 506.28s]  What would happen?
[508.78s -> 510.08s]  I think Twitter would go down.
[514.57s -> 516.37s]  Like, if it was like, Super Mario!
[517.29s -> 518.69s]  It's 8! Or something.
[519.19s -> 522.19s]  Like, Super Mario Galaxy 3 was on PlayStation 5.
[524.24s -> 524.94s]  What do you think would happen?
[527.66s -> 529.16s]  Talk to the factory entrepreneur. Alright, there we go.
[530.09s -> 531.49s]  Alright, we're gonna pick up where we left off yesterday.
[531.49s -> 532.79s]  I really like this game. I think it's fun.
[534.60s -> 535.80s]  That would make no sense.
[540.56s -> 542.56s]  I know, that would make no fucking sense.
[543.60s -> 545.50s]  It would make absolutely no sense.
[547.67s -> 549.07s]  That's like a dream that you have.
[549.77s -> 553.57s]  Right? What I just said was so stupid and just so, like, I'm just stalling to make a tweet.
[554.50s -> 556.50s]  That- You have a dream where that happens.
[561.56s -> 563.86s]  And it's a dream that you forget when you wake up.
[563.86s -> 565.06s]  It's so asinine.
[565.36s -> 566.16s]  And just so- Just-
[566.90s -> 568.00s]  Not important at all.
[568.50s -> 569.60s]  That's the ones you forget.
[571.40s -> 573.10s]  What the fuck was that dream? I don't know.
[573.10s -> 574.70s]  Something about, like, a game? I don't know.
[574.70s -> 577.30s]  I forget it. It was so fucking inconsequential to me.
[580.37s -> 581.07s]  Alright, let's go.
[584.18s -> 585.38s]  Is camera not on right?
[586.32s -> 588.82s]  I'm always so paranoid about this shit. I swear to God.
[589.62s -> 590.12s]  Oh, wait, hold on.
[595.63s -> 596.83s]  Did it go into full screen, man?
[598.95s -> 600.15s]  Ooh, I remember this music.
[606.60s -> 607.60s]  What the fuck? Naked.
[607.90s -> 608.30s]  Yeah.
[608.70s -> 609.70s]  You wish.
[611.53s -> 614.43s]  Alright, so, where we left off, if you missed the last stream.
[615.56s -> 617.16s]  Wait, this is Chocolatier.
[618.77s -> 620.27s]  I forget- I don't know what this is a hashtag.
[620.67s -> 622.07s]  Not a hashtag, it's a colon.
[622.67s -> 624.37s]  It's called the- It's just Chocolatier.
[625.17s -> 626.17s]  You make chocolates.
[626.77s -> 629.67s]  You have to fly around the world, buy ingredients, make money.
[629.67s -> 632.07s]  If you weren't here yesterday, you missed a lot of money.
[635.56s -> 637.16s]  The last thing I was doing- We have a quest log here.
[637.76s -> 638.96s]  Right, okay. I remember.
[640.53s -> 641.63s]  It was gambling? Yes, there is.
[641.63s -> 642.93s]  But I'm not gonna go do that right now.
[642.93s -> 645.83s]  I'm gonna just chill and play- I gotta do my quests.
[649.95s -> 653.96s]  That was disgusting. I'm sad that that got picked up by the microphone.
[656.81s -> 658.71s]  Alright, so, I got coffee here.
[659.63s -> 661.33s]  This is my Cuban clock cleaner.
[662.36s -> 665.80s]  It's got cayenne pepper, Cuban coffee, and honey.
[666.46s -> 667.26s]  If I'm not mistaken.
[667.36s -> 668.66s]  This is a huge seller.
[672.79s -> 674.59s]  And then I'm making the special reserve.
[674.59s -> 675.99s]  Right, I'm making it for a reason though.
[678.06s -> 680.26s]  I have 40 cases of Arabian Bolden Inventory.
[680.76s -> 682.76s]  I'm gonna go back to this fine coffee maker here.
[683.75s -> 685.15s]  I have two cases- Oh wait, this guy.
[685.15s -> 686.15s]  The guy that gave us the tip.
[686.25s -> 687.15s]  I forgot about this guy.
[688.72s -> 689.52s]  He doesn't want very much.
[689.52s -> 692.72s]  Okay, we'd have to give him two cases of raspberry.
[693.90s -> 695.60s]  24 cases of Cafe Con Leche.
[696.78s -> 700.98s]  Alright, 34 cases of special 66% African cacao reserves.
[701.80s -> 702.50s]  Which I should have.
[703.30s -> 703.90s]  Talk to-
[705.00s -> 706.30s]  Oh wait, we have to go back to this person?
[716.02s -> 719.83s]  This guy wants to bring two cases of raspberry.
[720.13s -> 721.23s]  And he gave us a recipe.
[721.23s -> 724.93s]  But he also wants 34 cases of the special reserve for a recipe.
[729.12s -> 730.52s]  So I gotta make the raspberry ones too.
[730.72s -> 731.92s]  I can't go back empty-handed here.
[731.92s -> 733.22s]  Alright, let's go back to the chocolate factory.
[740.13s -> 741.03s]  Leche means milk.
[743.20s -> 744.30s]  Why is that confusing you?
[745.74s -> 747.14s]  Look, it's been a day.
[748.89s -> 749.89s]  The chocolate ark.
[749.99s -> 750.39s]  That's right.
[750.39s -> 751.49s]  Alright, so what do we got?
[752.67s -> 755.57s]  I have 30- Okay, I need 34 of the special reserve.
[755.57s -> 757.17s]  I have 34 Cuban clock cleaners.
[757.17s -> 758.77s]  This is gonna be a fucking huge sale.
[759.17s -> 761.07s]  Oh, that's not good.
[761.07s -> 762.27s]  No, no, I'm not selling it here.
[762.81s -> 764.51s]  Get out of here with these low prices.
[768.51s -> 769.31s]  What else do I need to make?
[769.91s -> 771.01s]  I need to continue making this.
[772.38s -> 773.28s]  Almost out of peppers.
[774.27s -> 775.77s]  We- I gotta change what coffee I'm making.
[775.77s -> 779.28s]  But first of all, I'm gonna make-
[779.38s -> 781.08s]  I'm just gonna make this right now.
[781.28s -> 783.46s]  And I'm gonna change it to raspberry.
[784.31s -> 785.21s]  Because we need a bunch of these.
[785.21s -> 785.61s]  Make it.
[785.61s -> 786.11s]  Here we go.
[786.68s -> 788.38s]  Let's see how rusty I am.
[791.51s -> 792.51s]  Poison in the coffee.
[794.25s -> 795.25s]  Well, you're a psycho.
[798.96s -> 802.06s]  Hey dude, I got a wicked good idea of how you can really grow your business.
[802.36s -> 803.76s]  Put poison in the coffee.
[804.79s -> 806.59s]  I think your business would not last very long.
[810.39s -> 811.89s]  You'd be out of business very shortly.
[817.74s -> 819.24s]  Put poison in the coffee.
[826.97s -> 828.37s]  You spend all the time.
[828.77s -> 833.07s]  All the money, all the resources to get the factories, get the permits.
[834.45s -> 837.45s]  And the first thing you want to do, the factory's ready to go.
[838.15s -> 838.95s]  You got the chocolate.
[838.95s -> 839.85s]  You've got the recipes.
[839.85s -> 841.65s]  It was passed out by your fucking grandmother.
[843.71s -> 845.31s]  Spray Windex and all that.
[846.60s -> 847.50s]  What the fuck, dude?
[847.50s -> 848.40s]  No, what are you doing?
[848.40s -> 849.20s]  What's wrong with you?
[849.20s -> 850.40s]  What the fuck, dude?
[851.00s -> 851.70s]  Fuck you.
[854.44s -> 855.44s]  All right, well, that's the end of that day.
[860.50s -> 863.10s]  Like, oh, we got our chocolate spinning in that big vat
[863.10s -> 865.40s]  that you see on every single one of those How It's Made videos.
[865.70s -> 866.70s]  With the churning.
[867.70s -> 868.60s]  It's a big bowl.
[869.14s -> 869.94s]  That's sideways.
[869.94s -> 870.64s]  That's spinning.
[871.04s -> 874.42s]  And some guy comes over the ladle and he drops like flavorings in it.
[874.42s -> 876.42s]  It spins around.
[877.06s -> 880.19s]  And then the CEO comes over with Windex and goes.
[886.20s -> 886.80s]  Fuck you.
[886.80s -> 887.60s]  Get out of here.
[887.90s -> 889.10s]  I'm doing shit here.
[894.09s -> 895.99s]  We just opened the factory.
[896.39s -> 897.89s]  Get the fuck out of here.
[898.53s -> 899.33s]  Go home.
[900.10s -> 901.50s]  He throws cigarettes in.
[901.80s -> 903.70s]  He just has a lit cigarette.
[905.34s -> 907.54s]  That chocolate looks really good.
[910.54s -> 913.74s]  Imagine being the chocolatier and being like, you fucking asshole.
[913.84s -> 915.34s]  Now we got to shut the whole thing down.
[918.64s -> 919.24s]  God.
[920.26s -> 921.26s]  Well, I'm not that guy.
[922.09s -> 923.09s]  He's actually mad.
[923.09s -> 924.19s]  I am mad at this guy.
[924.29s -> 925.89s]  This guy, that was stupid what he did.
[925.99s -> 926.99s]  He shouldn't have done that.
[927.39s -> 931.56s]  He sprayed Windex into my chocolate spinning undulator
[931.56s -> 932.96s]  and it's making me very mad.
[932.96s -> 934.86s]  This person doesn't exist, but I hate them.
[935.06s -> 935.96s]  I hate this person.
[938.58s -> 939.18s]  Oh, we're out of coffee.
[939.18s -> 939.48s]  Okay.
[942.83s -> 944.33s]  You mad at a made-up person.
[944.73s -> 945.33s]  So what?
[950.35s -> 951.05s]  Could be real.
[951.65s -> 952.05s]  Okay.
[952.25s -> 953.45s]  Now, okay, we need to change this.
[953.55s -> 955.85s]  We need more of the special reserve chocolate.
[956.25s -> 957.05s]  I love this game.
[957.05s -> 958.25s]  This game is so cool.
[960.46s -> 960.76s]  All right.
[960.76s -> 962.26s]  I need to do a change recipe.
[964.02s -> 965.12s]  I need a raspberry.
[966.02s -> 966.92s]  Ooh, look at that.
[968.83s -> 969.93s]  How many cases do I need?
[970.79s -> 971.69s]  Just two, right?
[972.09s -> 973.69s]  But we could probably sell this for pretty good.
[976.15s -> 976.35s]  All right.
[976.35s -> 976.85s]  Let's go for it.
[981.23s -> 982.23s]  Beef in the chocolate.
[985.97s -> 988.97s]  I mean, I don't know how the in-depth the game gets later,
[990.99s -> 992.39s]  but I know for a fact that
[993.53s -> 996.33s]  we have at least four of the pages that we have not made chocolates on.
[997.83s -> 998.73s]  That's a full stack.
[998.83s -> 999.83s]  That's a full stack.
[999.83s -> 1000.83s]  I'm really happy about that one.
[1000.83s -> 1001.73s]  Really happy about that turned out.
[1003.87s -> 1006.07s]  I wish that I wish that I didn't want games like this.
[1007.54s -> 1009.04s]  I don't care about any other video game.
[1009.74s -> 1011.74s]  You guys wanted me to watch the fucking PlayStation Direct.
[1012.04s -> 1012.94s]  I care about this.
[1012.94s -> 1014.04s]  I want I'm gonna play this.
[1018.02s -> 1020.02s]  Like PlayStation could have come up with a press release that said
[1020.02s -> 1023.12s]  if you watched the direct you got $50 deposited into your bank account
[1023.12s -> 1024.52s]  and I would be like I'd rather play the chocolate game.
[1024.52s -> 1024.92s]  I don't care.
[1026.14s -> 1026.94s]  Be like, no, I don't care.
[1032.86s -> 1033.36s]  I'm busy.
[1033.96s -> 1034.76s]  I'm very busy.
[1038.48s -> 1039.48s]  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[1045.17s -> 1046.17s]  Rich Stravers.
[1056.43s -> 1059.43s]  No, I'm am I the am I the weird CEO?
[1061.10s -> 1065.00s]  No, I don't want to be the weird CEO guy that like just I'm playing my
[1065.00s -> 1065.70s]  chocolate game.
[1065.70s -> 1066.30s]  Leave me alone.
[1067.78s -> 1068.88s]  Get the fuck away from me.
[1074.26s -> 1075.76s]  You're a millennial CEO.
[1076.94s -> 1081.50s]  I've got I've got like a fucking Star Wars t-shirt on.
[1082.10s -> 1087.96s]  I'm wearing slippers and like jogging pants and I like skipped out on
[1087.96s -> 1091.16s]  my company meeting because I'm playing an old nostalgic chocolate
[1091.16s -> 1092.26s]  making game.
[1094.12s -> 1098.72s]  Oh, no guys.
[1098.72s -> 1100.82s]  This shit like kind of happened.
[1104.76s -> 1106.46s]  I've got like important stuff going on.
[1106.86s -> 1109.96s]  We got I got a huge fucking stream coming up and I skipped out on
[1109.96s -> 1110.66s]  a fucking meeting.
[1111.66s -> 1113.56s]  It didn't happen today, but it may have happened.
[1114.36s -> 1115.56s]  I lay yesterday.
[1120.93s -> 1121.73s]  It's real.
[1124.17s -> 1125.57s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't worry.
[1126.04s -> 1126.44s]  It's okay.
[1126.44s -> 1131.64s]  I'll bring myself down a few pegs when I do the Catboy stream, right?
[1139.00s -> 1140.00s]  Down a few pegs.
[1140.00s -> 1140.90s]  It's a term.
[1141.10s -> 1142.40s]  It's cleaning your clock.
[1142.40s -> 1143.40s]  It's down a few pegs.
[1143.40s -> 1144.70s]  It's getting knocked down a few.
[1146.06s -> 1148.06s]  You have no idea what my plan is for that stream.
[1148.36s -> 1150.96s]  I'm going to tell you one of the plans and I can't do it and I
[1150.96s -> 1152.06s]  it's a hold on.
[1153.16s -> 1154.36s]  I have to ask if I can do no.
[1154.36s -> 1154.56s]  All right.
[1154.56s -> 1155.86s]  You know, I'm going to tell you one of the things I was going to
[1155.86s -> 1158.06s]  do you don't think I'll be knocked down a few pegs.
[1158.26s -> 1162.16s]  I wanted to have should I tell you should I tell you should I keep
[1162.16s -> 1163.86s]  it a secret for the Catboy stream?
[1163.86s -> 1165.26s]  That's something that'll knock me down a few pegs.
[1166.72s -> 1167.02s]  Hmm.
[1167.59s -> 1168.99s]  Maybe I'll tell you now.
[1168.99s -> 1171.29s]  No, I can't tell you because if I can do it, it's worth it.
[1172.70s -> 1173.10s]  Secret.
[1173.10s -> 1173.30s]  All right.
[1173.30s -> 1173.70s]  It's fine.
[1173.70s -> 1174.30s]  It's fine.
[1174.30s -> 1174.60s]  Fine.
[1174.90s -> 1175.20s]  Fine.
[1180.10s -> 1180.30s]  All right.
[1180.30s -> 1180.70s]  How about this?
[1180.70s -> 1185.76s]  If I can't do it, I'll tell you if I cannot do the thing I want
[1185.76s -> 1190.61s]  to do on the Catboy stream after the Catboy stream, I will tell
[1190.61s -> 1194.18s]  you what it was and then you can decide if it was a bad or
[1194.18s -> 1195.08s]  a good idea or not.
[1195.18s -> 1195.58s]  Okay.
[1199.53s -> 1199.83s]  Deal.
[1199.83s -> 1200.13s]  All right.
[1200.13s -> 1200.33s]  Cool.
[1200.33s -> 1200.63s]  Cool.
[1201.50s -> 1201.70s]  All right.
[1201.70s -> 1202.50s]  So I have enough.
[1204.16s -> 1204.46s]  All right.
[1204.46s -> 1207.76s]  So let's go deliver this to this the guy he wants the raspberry.
[1207.76s -> 1208.16s]  I'm going to see.
[1208.16s -> 1209.06s]  He wants to raspberry.
[1209.06s -> 1210.26s]  So I'm going to who likes row.
[1210.26s -> 1217.34s]  Ooh, it's 17 sell 15 of these raspberry cases.
[1217.34s -> 1220.14s]  That's 8,800 bucks clean right there.
[1221.35s -> 1222.25s]  Bring those two to him.
[1222.25s -> 1226.38s]  He needs I can get what way more for this coffee.
[1227.45s -> 1230.15s]  I changed the coffee to any cayenne peppers, but I'm flooding
[1230.15s -> 1231.45s]  the market with Cuban clock cleaners.
[1232.64s -> 1234.14s]  Remember, it's two Catboy streams.
[1235.65s -> 1235.95s]  Yeah.
[1236.25s -> 1242.68s]  Well, the first Catboy stream is going to be a little wild.
[1242.68s -> 1243.88s]  The second Catboy stream of us.
[1244.28s -> 1244.68s]  I don't know.
[1244.68s -> 1245.68s]  I'm not going to say it.
[1248.93s -> 1249.43s]  Just wait.
[1249.93s -> 1250.33s]  Just wait.
[1250.33s -> 1250.83s]  Maybe.
[1251.13s -> 1252.13s]  Maybe you're like a year.
[1252.13s -> 1252.63s]  I'm just kidding.
[1252.63s -> 1253.63s]  It'll happen in like a few months.
[1254.33s -> 1254.73s]  I'm just kidding.
[1254.73s -> 1256.53s]  It'll happen in probably like three months, four months.
[1257.46s -> 1258.06s]  All right, let's go.
[1259.02s -> 1260.82s]  I need to travel to where was this guy?
[1265.85s -> 1268.48s]  Okay in years.
[1272.20s -> 1273.00s]  It's not tomorrow.
[1273.00s -> 1273.30s]  No.
[1275.05s -> 1275.25s]  All right.
[1275.25s -> 1275.65s]  Here we go.
[1278.12s -> 1278.92s]  Hey Steve.
[1278.92s -> 1280.22s]  So that was the two raspberry.
[1282.20s -> 1285.67s]  Oh, so we got this guy's a contact now and then 34 cases of the reserve.
[1285.67s -> 1286.17s]  There it is.
[1286.78s -> 1289.08s]  I trust Felix had something to do with this in which case it's
[1289.08s -> 1292.48s]  my pleasure to give you a new coffee recipe special blend.
[1293.34s -> 1295.94s]  And of course you can find the Moroccan coffee for this recipe
[1295.94s -> 1297.34s]  at the market here in Tangier's.
[1297.74s -> 1299.04s]  Stop by in a month or so.
[1299.04s -> 1300.64s]  I hear all kinds of things down at the port.
[1301.75s -> 1305.17s]  Ooh, special blend.
[1308.43s -> 1309.63s]  I got I have a lot of this.
[1310.40s -> 1311.70s]  Should I make some special blend coffee?
[1311.70s -> 1312.00s]  No.
[1312.98s -> 1313.48s]  No, what was that?
[1313.48s -> 1314.38s]  That was a weird voice.
[1315.37s -> 1316.67s]  I had a fucking dream about SpongeBob.
[1316.67s -> 1317.07s]  What was it?
[1318.93s -> 1319.23s]  Oh my God.
[1319.23s -> 1320.33s]  What was the dream about SpongeBob?
[1320.93s -> 1324.79s]  I had one of those stupid inconsequential dreams and
[1324.79s -> 1326.99s]  remember we talked about how Super Mario was on PlayStation 5
[1327.39s -> 1329.29s]  and that's like a dumb dream that like who cares and you wake
[1329.29s -> 1330.29s]  up and you don't even give a shit anymore.
[1330.29s -> 1331.09s]  You forget it in an hour.
[1331.89s -> 1334.99s]  I had a SpongeBob on TV did something dream.
[1335.29s -> 1337.49s]  That was so dumb and inconsequential and meant nothing.
[1337.69s -> 1338.39s]  But what was it?
[1342.14s -> 1343.34s]  Oh my God.
[1343.34s -> 1344.04s]  What was it?
[1344.34s -> 1345.94s]  It was so inconsequential.
[1345.94s -> 1346.74s]  It was stupid.
[1349.20s -> 1349.60s]  Okay.
[1351.54s -> 1355.74s]  I think the reason why I said the imagine if Mario was on
[1355.74s -> 1359.84s]  PlayStation thing was because I think the only thing that was
[1359.84s -> 1363.54s]  weird about the dream was SpongeBob was on TBS or something.
[1364.57s -> 1365.17s]  That was it.
[1365.77s -> 1367.47s]  It was like, oh why SpongeBob's on TBS?
[1367.47s -> 1368.67s]  That's he's not on this network.
[1368.67s -> 1370.07s]  I think that's why I said that today.
[1373.66s -> 1374.66s]  Is that really what happened?
[1374.86s -> 1376.96s]  Am I just retroactively adding that memory in?
[1376.96s -> 1377.46s]  I don't know.
[1378.26s -> 1379.36s]  I think that's what happened though.
[1383.56s -> 1383.96s]  Okay.
[1383.96s -> 1385.53s]  Let's all right.
[1385.53s -> 1386.83s]  I need to sell fine.
[1387.13s -> 1389.33s]  I trusted you with a recipe silly zonka wonka.
[1390.37s -> 1392.97s]  I also trusted the next time you darken my doorway.
[1393.07s -> 1395.07s]  You'll have 40 cases of Arabian bold.
[1395.07s -> 1395.87s]  We agreed upon.
[1404.94s -> 1407.44s]  That's not a bad price considering I flooded the market with this stuff.
[1414.19s -> 1415.39s]  No, no, no, I'm not going to sell it here.
[1416.29s -> 1417.09s]  Let me say play the game.
[1417.09s -> 1417.89s]  This is playing the game.
[1417.89s -> 1419.59s]  It's fucking talking and making deals.
[1421.39s -> 1422.89s]  That's the what is we talking about play the game.
[1422.89s -> 1434.22s]  I'm talking and making deals with people Jesus.
[1434.22s -> 1435.02s]  That's so expensive.
[1436.32s -> 1436.52s]  All right.
[1436.52s -> 1437.22s]  I'm going to go.
[1439.12s -> 1440.92s]  I'm going to go sell this.
[1442.66s -> 1443.26s]  You have peppers.
[1443.56s -> 1443.86s]  No.
[1443.86s -> 1444.16s]  Okay.
[1444.16s -> 1445.06s]  I need to get peppers.
[1447.47s -> 1450.97s]  Let's see if we can sell this Cuban clock cleaner for like 150 grand.
[1454.37s -> 1454.67s]  I can.
[1454.67s -> 1454.97s]  All right.
[1454.97s -> 1456.07s]  I can get about this is cheap.
[1459.82s -> 1460.22s]  Fuck.
[1460.76s -> 1462.26s]  I had an opportunity to get rid of all this.
[1465.41s -> 1466.61s]  That's not a bad price for this though.
[1467.21s -> 1467.91s]  Yeah, I'll sell it.
[1471.12s -> 1472.52s]  Not a bad price for the raspberry either.
[1474.64s -> 1475.14s]  I'm gonna sell it.
[1478.34s -> 1482.14s]  I want someone to previous to seem for 15 to 45.
[1482.54s -> 1485.74s]  I could have sold it for 2238 in Tangier's fuck.
[1489.82s -> 1491.72s]  Did I hear that you might be able to move a bit on your offer?
[1492.62s -> 1493.82s]  But that's still not enough.
[1496.39s -> 1497.09s]  Is that the best price?
[1497.09s -> 1498.99s]  I'm going to get for this until I have to change coffees.
[1500.57s -> 1505.91s]  We're like, this is the among us guy.
[1507.42s -> 1512.11s]  No, you keep people keep confusing me for that person.
[1517.46s -> 1519.66s]  People confuse me for that person all the time.
[1521.04s -> 1522.14s]  I don't know who that person is.
[1526.21s -> 1526.91s]  You're a liar.
[1529.26s -> 1531.66s]  They used germa sus at the Sony conference.
[1531.66s -> 1532.96s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[1532.96s -> 1533.56s]  No, they didn't.
[1534.82s -> 1535.12s]  Hold on.
[1535.12s -> 1535.92s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[1540.32s -> 1540.52s]  Fuck.
[1540.52s -> 1541.52s]  I just exit of the game.
[1542.87s -> 1543.17s]  I did.
[1543.17s -> 1543.47s]  I'm good.
[1545.55s -> 1546.05s]  What do you mean?
[1547.11s -> 1547.51s]  Show me.
[1547.71s -> 1548.11s]  Show me.
[1549.78s -> 1550.18s]  They did.
[1550.18s -> 1550.78s]  No, they didn't.
[1550.78s -> 1551.48s]  I don't believe you.
[1556.50s -> 1559.60s]  Which master grill xbbq has been banned or whatever.
[1559.70s -> 1566.48s]  Good stream of it.
[1566.48s -> 1567.78s]  But why are you linking me this?
[1570.73s -> 1571.93s]  Why are you linking me this?
[1574.55s -> 1575.45s]  Give me the real one.
[1575.45s -> 1577.65s]  Give me the why are you linking me this shit?
[1579.76s -> 1580.06s]  Okay.
[1580.26s -> 1582.96s]  So for like the people that have told me please play the game
[1582.96s -> 1586.23s]  and let's hang out you have to blame not just me.
[1586.23s -> 1586.93s]  I'm making deals.
[1587.33s -> 1590.23s]  You got to blame the people like the 5,000 people that sent
[1590.23s -> 1592.93s]  a link in the chat saying please click germa sus is here
[1593.23s -> 1595.83s]  and it's a streamer band fake streamer band thing.
[1599.58s -> 1601.68s]  We do talk about wasting time.
[1603.12s -> 1605.02s]  This is like the ultimate time waster.
[1608.01s -> 1608.51s]  It's all right.
[1608.51s -> 1609.51s]  I'll be here for a while today.
[1609.51s -> 1611.01s]  I'm not was ain't going to be a three-hour stream.
[1612.32s -> 1614.92s]  You're enabling them wrong link.
[1614.92s -> 1615.92s]  Well, what's the right one?
[1615.92s -> 1616.82s]  I haven't seen it yet.
[1619.24s -> 1620.54s]  Google.com.
[1621.46s -> 1622.36s]  What is wrong with you?
[1625.91s -> 1628.21s]  You do literally have an Among Us command sus.
[1628.51s -> 1631.71s]  Oh my god, bear that person for a six minutes.
[1635.58s -> 1636.58s]  I have a yes.
[1636.78s -> 1637.08s]  All right.
[1637.08s -> 1637.58s]  It's time.
[1637.58s -> 1638.68s]  It's time for me to go off.
[1639.54s -> 1641.04s]  You know how I have a sus command.
[1641.04s -> 1645.54s]  I do I have a sus command that is sense danger.
[1645.54s -> 1646.94s]  It is from sorcery.
[1647.24s -> 1649.94s]  I've had that command since like 2015.
[1651.40s -> 1655.30s]  That's a command from it's a spell in the game sorcery way
[1655.30s -> 1656.90s]  before all this among us shit.
[1657.63s -> 1660.63s]  I said shit with a like an angry mean voice, but I meant to
[1660.63s -> 1665.56s]  say like among us shit like all this among us stuff had that
[1665.56s -> 1667.56s]  for like five years and I ain't changing it.

[1692.63s -> 1693.93s]  I'm gonna check and see if there's a full moon tonight.
[1699.20s -> 1707.31s]  Is it I bet it is I bet it is okay, so I can I don't know
[1707.31s -> 1708.91s]  if I want to sell this for 1887.
[1710.80s -> 1712.30s]  I can get a better price somewhere else.
[1713.00s -> 1715.00s]  Although I should buy some more peppers.
[1716.31s -> 1717.91s]  Are you is this price final here?
[1719.09s -> 1720.49s]  Is there a little bit of wiggle room here?
[1720.69s -> 1721.39s]  Thank you.
[1721.69s -> 1722.89s]  What that really is a little bit.
[1722.89s -> 1724.09s]  That was like a dollar off.
[1727.10s -> 1731.48s]  That was three dollars off the full moon tomorrow.
[1731.48s -> 1732.08s]  Yeah, I know.
[1732.48s -> 1732.78s]  Trust me.
[1732.78s -> 1733.18s]  I know.
[1737.49s -> 1741.19s]  Well, whatever I need enough to get rid of the honey.
[1742.28s -> 1743.08s]  I'm going big.
[1746.19s -> 1747.39s]  I'm gonna sell a shitload of these.
[1747.39s -> 1747.59s]  All right.
[1747.59s -> 1749.79s]  You might think that but it was a bad idea, but I needed the
[1749.79s -> 1754.57s]  peppers almonds are pretty cheap here.
[1757.71s -> 1760.75s]  Ooh, that's cheap friends.
[1760.75s -> 1761.55s]  These are really cheap.
[1763.64s -> 1764.74s]  Yeah, I'm gonna get a bunch of these two.
[1766.44s -> 1767.34s]  Let's get a hundred of these.
[1769.84s -> 1770.94s]  I got tons of sugar already.
[1775.71s -> 1777.71s]  All right, that should continue to produce by the way, if
[1777.71s -> 1779.61s]  you don't know why I did that if this is me that weren't
[1779.61s -> 1784.38s]  here yesterday every time I travel or make a new batch
[1784.38s -> 1787.28s]  of chocolate a week goes by so this is not producing
[1787.28s -> 1788.08s]  chocolate right now.
[1788.28s -> 1791.38s]  It only starts to produce when I cycle through time.
[1791.75s -> 1792.55s]  We have not done that yet.
[1792.55s -> 1795.45s]  It's every every time I do a task.
[1795.65s -> 1796.55s]  No one cares.
[1798.15s -> 1798.95s]  Oh, okay.
[1799.05s -> 1803.05s]  No, no one cares says Jerma zerked on stream.
[1811.30s -> 1815.00s]  Jerma zerked on stream says hey nobody cares.
[1818.16s -> 1819.66s]  Should we mod them for an hour?
[1826.09s -> 1827.69s]  No, I can't see back.
[1827.69s -> 1832.18s]  All right back like back like years ago like all mod
[1832.18s -> 1832.88s]  that guy ha ha.
[1832.88s -> 1833.18s]  Oh, yeah.
[1833.18s -> 1836.18s]  I modded that guy for like 45 minutes or something.
[1836.85s -> 1839.15s]  There are whole systems in place now across like the
[1839.15s -> 1840.55s]  discord and the channel.
[1840.85s -> 1844.16s]  We're modding somebody for like 30 minutes might pose
[1844.16s -> 1846.56s]  complete disaster to detonate the entire community.
[1847.99s -> 1850.09s]  They could just they could cause mayhem if they really
[1850.09s -> 1851.89s]  wanted to so like I can't do that anymore.
[1856.51s -> 1860.62s]  It's a funny thought though, isn't it true?
[1860.62s -> 1861.32s]  So do it.
[1861.52s -> 1865.02s]  No VIP them.
[1865.22s -> 1866.52s]  There are whole systems in place.
[1866.52s -> 1866.72s]  Now.
[1866.72s -> 1870.22s]  All right play the fucking game 13% of people that watch
[1870.22s -> 1872.32s]  the stream on the census want you to play the video
[1872.32s -> 1872.52s]  game.
[1872.52s -> 1873.72s]  I have to make them happy.
[1876.82s -> 1877.12s]  Holy shit.
[1877.12s -> 1877.92s]  I gotta take a picture of this.
[1878.52s -> 1879.62s]  What the fuck is going on?
[1880.12s -> 1881.32s]  Quick quick quick quick quick quick quick quick.
[1881.32s -> 1883.02s]  This battery just is standing on end.
[1883.12s -> 1884.02s]  This is like a magic thing.
[1884.32s -> 1885.12s]  I have no idea what's going on.
[1885.12s -> 1886.22s]  I don't know how this is happening how this is how
[1886.22s -> 1886.72s]  this is happening.
[1887.55s -> 1888.35s]  I gotta get a picture of this.
[1890.30s -> 1891.00s]  Oh my fucking God.
[1891.00s -> 1894.33s]  What is doing this floating?
[1894.43s -> 1895.73s]  I have a floating battery in front of me.
[1897.61s -> 1909.88s]  Why why holy shit?
[1909.88s -> 1910.88s]  Why is that happening?
[1912.16s -> 1912.46s]  Okay.
[1912.46s -> 1912.76s]  Okay.
[1912.76s -> 1915.71s]  I have to let me get I have to shut I'm gonna put
[1915.71s -> 1920.06s]  this on the discord or just I'm gonna put it on
[1920.06s -> 1925.23s]  here the cam on no no no I can't I'm naked.
[1928.52s -> 1929.72s]  Why did this happen?
[1934.74s -> 1935.64s]  You guys have to see this.
[1935.64s -> 1936.34s]  I gotta get this.
[1936.34s -> 1936.74s]  I'll tweet.
[1936.74s -> 1937.64s]  I'm gonna tweet this out.
[1941.13s -> 1941.93s]  Here comes a tweet.
[1953.38s -> 1955.28s]  I'm just gonna I don't understand why this happened.
[1961.06s -> 1969.92s]  You tell me what's going on here.
[1970.22s -> 1972.82s]  This is probably so easily explainable, but I can't
[1972.82s -> 1973.22s]  explain it.
[1973.22s -> 1974.82s]  So I'm gonna delete this tweet in like an hour.
[1984.48s -> 1985.28s]  Okay, here it goes.
[1990.71s -> 1991.71s]  Tell me what's going on here.
[1998.87s -> 1999.47s]  Did it go through?
[2003.72s -> 2004.32s]  Why did that happen?
[2008.47s -> 2009.27s]  Why is this floating?
[2016.98s -> 2017.68s]  It's a magnet.
[2019.02s -> 2019.72s]  This is not a magnet.
[2019.72s -> 2022.02s]  That's a base of my that's the base of my monitors.
[2022.02s -> 2023.02s]  That's a monitor stand.
[2024.07s -> 2024.77s]  It's dusty.
[2025.37s -> 2025.87s]  Come on.
[2027.19s -> 2028.19s]  But what do you mean magnet?
[2028.19s -> 2030.19s]  This is this is the bottom of my monitor stand.
[2032.36s -> 2040.00s]  This is not there's not a magnet right here static
[2040.00s -> 2040.40s]  electricity.
[2040.40s -> 2041.40s]  Why is the battery stuck?
[2041.40s -> 2041.70s]  I don't know.
[2041.70s -> 2042.60s]  It's stuck hard.
[2042.90s -> 2044.20s]  There's a magnet in the battery.
[2047.91s -> 2049.31s]  You can't see the magnets in the monitor.
[2049.31s -> 2052.42s]  What your monitor has magnetic properties.
[2053.89s -> 2054.69s]  I'm gonna put it on stream.
[2057.08s -> 2057.58s]  You guys see it.
[2057.58s -> 2058.18s]  It's all magnets.
[2058.18s -> 2059.48s]  This literally has to be a magnet in there.
[2059.48s -> 2060.68s]  Why would there be a magnet on the bottom of my
[2060.68s -> 2061.18s]  monitor?
[2066.00s -> 2067.60s]  What the fuck would the point be having a monitor
[2067.60s -> 2068.80s]  stand with a magnet in the bottom?
[2069.73s -> 2070.63s]  Why would you tweet this?
[2070.63s -> 2071.03s]  I don't know.
[2071.23s -> 2071.73s]  I'm deleting it.
[2084.04s -> 2084.94s]  Batteries are magnetic.
[2084.94s -> 2087.58s]  Yeah, but I have like a plastic stand.
[2093.59s -> 2094.59s]  I think that's magic.
[2105.69s -> 2106.19s]  Okay, that's this.
[2106.19s -> 2108.89s]  That's the image you send like to your mom being
[2108.89s -> 2109.49s]  like mom.
[2109.49s -> 2110.99s]  What the heck is going on?
[2110.99s -> 2112.99s]  And she's like, oh honey, that's really really
[2112.99s -> 2113.59s]  interesting.
[2114.13s -> 2117.13s]  No, there are magnets battery is magnetized
[2117.53s -> 2119.83s]  and it's sticking to the metal base of your
[2120.23s -> 2122.63s]  monitor really neat though, really really cool
[2122.63s -> 2123.53s]  that it happened that way.
[2123.53s -> 2124.53s]  I didn't put it there.
[2126.35s -> 2128.56s]  I'm telling you I just like I took a sip of my
[2128.56s -> 2130.86s]  coffee and I heard and I looked over in this
[2130.86s -> 2134.20s]  fucking Duracell just sticking out of my monitor.
[2136.46s -> 2136.96s]  That was weird.
[2136.96s -> 2137.46s]  It's neat.
[2137.46s -> 2140.17s]  Okay, neat things.
[2140.27s -> 2141.57s]  All right, clean your desk.
[2142.62s -> 2143.22s]  It's dusty.
[2143.22s -> 2144.22s]  I live in Las Vegas.
[2147.90s -> 2149.10s]  It's dry and dusty here.
[2155.08s -> 2155.58s]  Dust it.
[2156.44s -> 2157.24s]  No, I did.
[2157.24s -> 2158.34s]  I do and none of that.
[2158.34s -> 2161.08s]  That's oh no, I see what you guys are saying.
[2162.31s -> 2165.28s]  That's just like a weird finish on the bottom
[2165.28s -> 2166.68s]  of my monitor.
[2169.95s -> 2171.55s]  I see what you guys are saying that like the
[2171.55s -> 2173.35s]  dust on the thing is not actually dust.
[2173.35s -> 2175.91s]  It's like a it's like just speckled for some
[2175.91s -> 2176.21s]  reason.
[2178.70s -> 2183.43s]  That was your fucking desk look like okay right
[2183.43s -> 2188.25s]  now at least 5000 of you just crumpled up the
[2188.25s -> 2191.15s]  fucking like McDonald's french fry container
[2191.15s -> 2192.95s]  you have on there just sitting there with like
[2192.95s -> 2196.15s]  three just dead gross fries at the bottom that
[2196.15s -> 2198.35s]  you didn't eat and you just like I threw that
[2198.35s -> 2198.55s]  away.
[2198.55s -> 2199.45s]  That's not on my desk.
[2203.09s -> 2205.59s]  Sure, but I have a little bit of dust on my desk.
[2205.59s -> 2207.49s]  I am not allowed to sneeze.
[2207.79s -> 2208.39s]  I'm sorry.
[2208.59s -> 2209.39s]  Okay, let's go.
[2211.53s -> 2212.33s]  You're projecting.
[2212.43s -> 2214.73s]  No, I it's called I am leveling with you.
[2218.54s -> 2222.60s]  We're not American but only Americans eat
[2222.60s -> 2223.30s]  McDonald's.
[2224.87s -> 2228.75s]  This person is lost by the way, they just keep
[2228.75s -> 2229.75s]  driving around in a circle.
[2229.75s -> 2231.65s]  I feel like I want to come to stop this person.
[2235.54s -> 2236.74s]  How much cocaine do you do?
[2236.74s -> 2237.34s]  Zero.
[2237.95s -> 2242.60s]  I have no drugs in my system and I never have I
[2242.60s -> 2244.50s]  am naturally fucking out of my mind.
[2244.60s -> 2252.54s]  Okay, it's natural.
[2252.74s -> 2253.54s]  What about red wine?
[2253.54s -> 2254.44s]  No, I just today.
[2254.44s -> 2254.74s]  I don't know.
[2254.74s -> 2257.14s]  I'm just like I'm like I'm uppity today.
[2257.14s -> 2258.54s]  You know, I'm very up up here.
[2258.84s -> 2260.60s]  I don't know why let's go.
[2260.60s -> 2261.50s]  What happened today?
[2263.24s -> 2265.54s]  Cheap you're kidding.
[2265.54s -> 2266.44s]  These are laughable.
[2273.70s -> 2274.80s]  This coffee sells really well.
[2274.80s -> 2275.50s]  Let's get 200.
[2279.50s -> 2281.30s]  You're absolutely on something illegal.
[2287.52s -> 2289.32s]  I wonder how can you know, it's really funny.
[2290.05s -> 2291.65s]  I've had conversations with people in the past
[2291.65s -> 2293.55s]  and like, okay, let's be let's just truly just
[2294.22s -> 2295.62s]  take a second here and just talk about this.
[2296.02s -> 2297.92s]  I've had people in the past actually tell me.
[2299.10s -> 2301.30s]  Yeah, dude, like I thought like maybe at some
[2301.30s -> 2303.50s]  point maybe you were on drugs at some point.

[2320.18s -> 2322.88s]  Like you like you've dabbled a little while on
[2322.88s -> 2323.38s]  stream.
[2323.38s -> 2325.08s]  No, absolutely not at zero.
[2325.08s -> 2326.48s]  Never in my life in my whole life.
[2329.35s -> 2330.35s]  Like that's okay.
[2331.57s -> 2333.57s]  And it's almost like more bizarre to them.
[2333.57s -> 2334.37s]  But that's the case.
[2335.90s -> 2336.70s]  Like wait.

[2358.75s -> 2359.25s]  That's what it is.
[2360.17s -> 2366.47s]  Yeah, that's yeah, of course uppity equals high.
[2366.87s -> 2367.17s]  All right.
[2367.17s -> 2367.97s]  Let's play the game.
[2372.57s -> 2373.67s]  That's a bad excuse.
[2373.67s -> 2374.97s]  I'm not even making an excuse.
[2374.97s -> 2376.07s]  I'm just having fun, man.

[2388.60s -> 2390.40s]  this incredible coffee.
[2390.84s -> 2391.44s]  It's a big trip.
[2391.44s -> 2392.14s]  I'm willing to take it.
[2392.14s -> 2392.54s]  Let's go.
[2396.41s -> 2397.31s]  I have ADHD.
[2397.31s -> 2398.11s]  I'm not a weirdo.
[2401.90s -> 2402.30s]  Wow.
[2402.50s -> 2403.60s]  Why do you have to be a weirdo?
[2403.60s -> 2405.00s]  If you have ADHD we're talking about.
[2412.29s -> 2414.31s]  Oh silly zonka wonka.
[2414.31s -> 2415.71s]  I have heard from Alexandra.
[2416.19s -> 2417.59s]  She needs to speak with you right away.
[2417.59s -> 2419.39s]  She will wait for you at the Hotel de Cuba.
[2419.69s -> 2420.29s]  Please go see her.

[2436.60s -> 2437.60s]  I'm almost out of raspberries.
[2438.66s -> 2439.36s]  You have raspberries?
[2445.24s -> 2445.64s]  Damn it.
[2445.64s -> 2446.64s]  What a waste of a trip.
[2453.43s -> 2454.43s]  I hate that.
[2454.83s -> 2455.63s]  I hate it.
[2455.83s -> 2457.03s]  I should have sold it.
[2463.49s -> 2463.99s]  I need a rock.
[2463.99s -> 2465.39s]  Okay, let's do Arabian bold.
[2467.76s -> 2468.86s]  I have this Kona coffee.
[2469.89s -> 2470.49s]  Moroccan coffee.
[2470.49s -> 2472.89s]  Okay, I've used them almost all my Cuban coffee.
[2475.36s -> 2476.26s]  Who would buy?
[2476.36s -> 2478.66s]  Maybe if I go to Cuba, will they like that?
[2478.66s -> 2479.56s]  I'm just gonna go to Cuba.
[2480.36s -> 2481.46s]  Cuban coffee in Cuba.
[2481.46s -> 2482.36s]  Have you not been to Cuba?
[2482.36s -> 2484.16s]  Have you not met Gina Famosa?
[2484.46s -> 2487.06s]  Have you not made me my cafe con leche?
[2490.60s -> 2493.20s]  This is the person that we owe like 40 cases of coffee to.
[2495.46s -> 2496.76s]  What happened to all your limes?
[2498.49s -> 2499.69s]  I still have 880.
[2502.10s -> 2502.80s]  All right, come on.
[2502.80s -> 2504.40s]  Old Havana, Hotel de Cuba.
[2505.00s -> 2505.50s]  Here she is.
[2506.53s -> 2507.53s]  Silly zonka wonka.
[2507.63s -> 2509.43s]  I could not be more pleased with your progress.
[2509.83s -> 2511.03s]  My search is proceeding.
[2513.94s -> 2514.54s]  Pace?
[2515.18s -> 2517.38s]  I fear that we are dealing with some pretty shady characters.
[2517.38s -> 2519.18s]  Do be careful about who you decide to trust.
[2521.61s -> 2524.62s]  But Link, hold on.
[2525.45s -> 2526.55s]  Just hold on, hold on, hold on.
[2527.05s -> 2530.45s]  In any event, my travels have taken me to Bali, Indonesia.
[2530.75s -> 2532.95s]  Sean and I spent quite a bit of time in Indonesia, you know.
[2533.35s -> 2535.65s]  And you, too, will now be able to visit this port.
[2536.15s -> 2539.55s]  Find Kintamani Plantation.
[2539.85s -> 2542.25s]  The owner is a fan of quality confections.
[2542.25s -> 2544.15s]  Be sure to see him when you're able to make the trip.
[2544.15s -> 2545.25s]  Cool, new area.
[2546.11s -> 2546.71s]  All right, hold on.
[2548.28s -> 2550.18s]  I have to do this because I can't...
[2552.60s -> 2554.50s]  Blinks have to be really worth it, by the way,
[2555.36s -> 2557.06s]  because alt-tabbing is horrible.
[2557.46s -> 2558.86s]  The sign's gone too far.
[2561.73s -> 2562.93s]  All right, it is pretty dusty in here.
[2570.80s -> 2571.90s]  Now, you know what this looks like?
[2572.83s -> 2577.27s]  This looks like you put, like, an old filter on Instagram.
[2578.84s -> 2581.24s]  You put film grain on this as an Instagram filter.
[2591.25s -> 2592.75s]  Is this image real or fake?
[2592.75s -> 2594.45s]  93% fail this quiz.
[2594.45s -> 2595.25s]  Would you?
[2600.30s -> 2601.80s]  It is, it is speckles.
[2610.38s -> 2611.08s]  You get too...
[2611.08s -> 2613.18s]  Okay, I have to be really honest with you.
[2613.48s -> 2617.88s]  If you get too close with anything, it looks like this.
[2619.17s -> 2621.97s]  Ever seen what one of your skin cells looks like under a microscope?
[2625.43s -> 2627.23s]  This is flash camera.
[2628.87s -> 2630.67s]  Like, you have any idea what you look like right now?
[2631.44s -> 2633.54s]  You understand how many dust mites are all over your body?
[2634.25s -> 2635.35s]  Same exact deal.
[2635.35s -> 2638.58s]  It's a flash camera that I took a picture of this.
[2643.02s -> 2646.82s]  Right now, there are billions of just, like, bugs eating skin cells on your body.
[2646.82s -> 2648.42s]  I know I just freaked you all out, but go look it up.
[2650.86s -> 2653.26s]  What do you look like under a fucking microscope, I wonder?
[2657.80s -> 2659.10s]  There are dust mites all over us.
[2659.10s -> 2659.50s]  Yeah.
[2664.66s -> 2665.96s]  I cannot do any more alt tabs.
[2670.99s -> 2671.89s]  No more alt tabbing.
[2674.87s -> 2676.87s]  This game is like 15 years old.
[2680.04s -> 2681.44s]  Irma has an attitude tonight.
[2682.24s -> 2683.04s]  What? No, I don't.
[2683.04s -> 2683.74s]  What are you talking about?
[2694.28s -> 2694.98s]  Okay, come on.
[2696.75s -> 2697.35s]  I'll take it.
[2698.70s -> 2699.10s]  I'll take it.
[2699.10s -> 2700.50s]  I have 142 cases.
[2703.39s -> 2704.29s]  This is 21.
[2704.29s -> 2706.19s]  This is the best price I've seen so far.
[2706.89s -> 2707.99s]  Let's see if I can get a little more.
[2708.99s -> 2709.89s]  Are you here to do some business?
[2709.89s -> 2711.09s]  You must do something for me here.
[2711.09s -> 2712.59s]  I'll be taking my wares elsewhere.
[2713.59s -> 2714.19s]  What are you trying to do here?
[2714.19s -> 2714.89s]  Rip me off?
[2725.85s -> 2727.35s]  That's so much money.
[2727.35s -> 2728.85s]  I can't blow this.
[2730.82s -> 2732.32s]  This is breakeven pricing.
[2732.72s -> 2733.42s]  What are you talking about?
[2733.42s -> 2735.62s]  I got this is $300,000.
[2736.98s -> 2739.98s]  I'll be at more than half a million dollars.
[2749.14s -> 2749.34s]  Done.
[2750.34s -> 2750.94s]  I need that.
[2751.04s -> 2752.44s]  The price is going to keep dropping.
[2752.84s -> 2753.64s]  I flooded the market.
[2753.64s -> 2755.34s]  We're not going to see $5,000.
[2756.14s -> 2757.44s]  Cuban claw cleaner ever again.
[2764.88s -> 2765.18s]  Come on.
[2768.22s -> 2768.72s]  Honey, honey.
[2772.12s -> 2774.08s]  125k.
[2774.98s -> 2775.48s]  Let's go.
[2777.28s -> 2778.78s]  $125,000.
[2778.78s -> 2779.58s]  I'm almost at a million.
[2779.68s -> 2780.28s]  I'll get there.
[2784.14s -> 2785.84s]  We're taking this out of circulation.
[2787.29s -> 2788.79s]  I'm going to change my coffee to something else.
[2788.79s -> 2790.19s]  We're going to take this out of circulation too.
[2792.00s -> 2795.00s]  Let's go back to coffee town.
[2796.35s -> 2796.85s]  Cape Town.
[2798.78s -> 2799.58s]  Change the coffee.
[2804.94s -> 2806.14s]  All right, change the recipe.
[2808.36s -> 2808.76s]  Coffee.
[2808.76s -> 2809.36s]  What do we got?
[2811.03s -> 2812.23s]  I could do special blend.
[2813.03s -> 2813.43s]  I have enough.
[2813.43s -> 2814.43s]  I have enough to make.
[2815.74s -> 2817.04s]  I'm going to run out of Cuban coffee.
[2819.50s -> 2821.10s]  The person we need Arabian bold.
[2821.99s -> 2827.96s]  We need 40 stacks of Arabian bold for one of the quests.
[2831.93s -> 2833.03s]  Well, this game is about chocolate.
[2833.43s -> 2838.10s]  It's about chocolate, coffee, lattes, and all kinds of other stuff.
[2840.43s -> 2840.83s]  Raid?
[2840.83s -> 2841.23s]  What raid?
[2841.90s -> 2842.50s]  I don't see a raid.
[2843.49s -> 2844.59s]  Oh, it's because the thing's fucked up.
[2844.59s -> 2844.89s]  Hold on.
[2850.68s -> 2851.48s]  I got to connect these.
[2852.83s -> 2853.83s]  I want a huge one.
[2856.03s -> 2856.63s]  Nope, not yet.
[2861.88s -> 2862.88s]  Look at how big this is going to be.
[2864.32s -> 2877.80s]  Oh, I missed.
[2877.90s -> 2878.20s]  It's okay.
[2878.30s -> 2887.79s]  Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
[2891.18s -> 2892.48s]  I hate its weird lag.
[2892.58s -> 2894.38s]  It's almost like I shouldn't be using a mouse to do this.
[2895.04s -> 2895.54s]  It's weird.
[2895.54s -> 2896.24s]  It's really weird.
[2898.57s -> 2899.77s]  With 30 cases in that a week.
[2904.89s -> 2905.69s]  Raid, raid.
[2906.78s -> 2907.58s]  I don't see anybody.
[2910.56s -> 2911.16s]  Okay, we got that.
[2911.16s -> 2911.96s]  We have 30 of them.
[2912.66s -> 2913.76s]  Need to bring 40.
[2914.16s -> 2915.26s]  Let me just check a few things here.
[2917.98s -> 2919.28s]  That's a good price.
[2919.92s -> 2920.62s]  Yeah, I'll take it.
[2922.37s -> 2922.97s]  Is it going to get me?
[2923.71s -> 2924.71s]  $23,000.
[2924.81s -> 2925.21s]  Nice.
[2926.69s -> 2927.89s]  Because I'm taking these out of circulation.
[2933.65s -> 2934.85s]  Obama raid?
[2934.85s -> 2935.75s]  What are you talking about?
[2940.84s -> 2941.64s]  What are you guys doing?
[2943.14s -> 2944.24s]  All right, we have to go.
[2945.42s -> 2945.82s]  Welcome.
[2945.82s -> 2947.32s]  I'm now stocking whipped cream.
[2947.32s -> 2949.22s]  It can be kind of pricey, but I recommend you pick some up.
[2952.25s -> 2954.15s]  $64 for whipped cream?
[2957.67s -> 2958.87s]  That seems kind of like a lot.
[2965.37s -> 2965.97s]  I'm going to get some.
[2969.46s -> 2970.06s]  I can top that.
[2970.06s -> 2971.26s]  I can put that on top of stuff.
[2977.00s -> 2978.40s]  Buy like $10,000.
[2981.23s -> 2982.23s]  Should I buy more than...
[2983.42s -> 2983.92s]  I'll buy...
[2984.22s -> 2984.62s]  No, no, no.
[2984.62s -> 2985.22s]  It'll go bad.
[2985.62s -> 2986.32s]  I won't even use it.
[2986.92s -> 2987.52s]  I'll buy $200.
[2991.12s -> 2992.52s]  Anything else worth picking up while I'm here?
[2994.49s -> 2995.99s]  I'm going to do enough raspberries.
[2995.99s -> 2997.89s]  I'm going to buy 17 raspberries.
[2998.89s -> 3001.89s]  Because I want at least one week of production here while I go back to Zurich.
[3002.96s -> 3003.26s]  Thank you.
[3004.65s -> 3005.35s]  And that's it.
[3008.02s -> 3009.22s]  Because I'm going to change this.
[3014.82s -> 3015.92s]  I got the 40 cases.
[3016.02s -> 3016.92s]  Have you not been to Cuba?
[3016.92s -> 3019.26s]  Have you not met Gina Famosa?
[3019.26s -> 3020.76s]  Have you not made my cafe con leche?
[3020.76s -> 3021.26s]  I have not.
[3021.66s -> 3022.36s]  I have not made it yet.
[3022.36s -> 3023.26s]  I'm making something else.
[3028.32s -> 3028.82s]  Good price.
[3033.67s -> 3034.57s]  Change that recipe.
[3034.57s -> 3034.77s]  All right.
[3034.77s -> 3035.37s]  What do I need to do?
[3035.57s -> 3036.67s]  Anybody have anything for me to do?
[3039.18s -> 3039.88s]  Caribbean bold.
[3040.38s -> 3041.18s]  Cafe con leche.
[3042.12s -> 3042.42s]  All right.
[3043.35s -> 3043.85s]  I need...
[3044.25s -> 3044.95s]  What should I make them?
[3045.55s -> 3046.65s]  What do I have?
[3048.55s -> 3048.75s]  All right.
[3048.75s -> 3051.05s]  I have the Sprite Sponge Bar, but I have no lemons.
[3051.05s -> 3052.95s]  I have 880 fucking limes.
[3052.95s -> 3053.85s]  What a waste.
[3055.08s -> 3056.38s]  What an absolute waste.
[3056.58s -> 3057.58s]  These are going to all go bad.
[3062.67s -> 3064.17s]  I guess I could just not make chocolate.
[3064.17s -> 3064.37s]  All right.
[3064.37s -> 3065.17s]  Cafe con leche.
[3066.46s -> 3067.36s]  I need Cuban coffee.
[3067.56s -> 3069.56s]  I'm about to burn through all my Cuban coffee.
[3071.77s -> 3073.77s]  This factory is not equipped to make this type of product.
[3073.77s -> 3074.07s]  Oh.
[3075.60s -> 3078.50s]  To make this product, we'll need to equip the factory to make coffee.
[3078.50s -> 3081.10s]  It'll cost $250,000.
[3082.96s -> 3084.26s]  You want to purchase the machinery.
[3090.88s -> 3091.78s]  That's a lot of money.
[3098.12s -> 3098.72s]  Maybe over the...
[3099.02s -> 3099.62s]  Coffee is...
[3100.52s -> 3100.82s]  No.
[3101.02s -> 3101.52s]  Not worth it.
[3106.88s -> 3107.78s]  How many oranges do I have?
[3108.28s -> 3108.88s]  188.
[3111.04s -> 3111.54s]  Mint.
[3112.84s -> 3113.24s]  Honey.
[3115.20s -> 3115.90s]  I can make these.
[3117.89s -> 3118.49s]  Yeah, let's make this.
[3120.48s -> 3121.18s]  We're going to go for a lot.
[3121.58s -> 3122.78s]  Honey, people love chocolate and honey.
[3132.78s -> 3133.18s]  Shit.
[3133.38s -> 3133.78s]  I missed.
[3139.13s -> 3139.73s]  Come on, come on, come on.
[3139.73s -> 3140.23s]  Give me something.
[3141.81s -> 3142.81s]  Better than that, please.
[3143.01s -> 3143.71s]  Oh my God.
[3143.71s -> 3144.31s]  This is terrible.
[3149.68s -> 3149.98s]  Got it.
[3149.98s -> 3150.18s]  Nice.
[3150.18s -> 3150.68s]  Full stack.
[3160.56s -> 3161.36s]  Give me a full stack.
[3162.64s -> 3163.44s]  Stop screaming.
[3163.44s -> 3164.24s]  What are you yelling at?
[3167.99s -> 3169.79s]  Give me a full stack.
[3170.67s -> 3171.27s]  Jesus.
[3178.42s -> 3179.32s]  He's going to make it faster.
[3179.32s -> 3180.02s]  I got to concentrate.
[3187.36s -> 3188.16s]  Okay, that's fine.
[3189.25s -> 3191.05s]  Oh, give me a full stack.
[3194.16s -> 3194.66s]  Okay.
[3196.04s -> 3198.84s]  Now we're going to change the recipe again because that's all I can't make anymore.
[3198.84s -> 3199.54s]  And we're going to make it something.
[3199.54s -> 3200.34s]  We do oranges.
[3204.02s -> 3204.52s]  Make.
[3204.92s -> 3205.52s]  Oh, it's not.
[3205.52s -> 3206.52s]  I can do better than 19 a week.
[3206.52s -> 3206.82s]  Can I?
[3210.28s -> 3211.78s]  I could get that to like 25.
[3211.78s -> 3212.18s]  Can't I?
[3218.05s -> 3219.25s]  Make lime chocolate.
[3227.30s -> 3227.80s]  Back it up.
[3247.61s -> 3248.01s]  Come on.
[3248.01s -> 3249.11s]  I need a stack, please.
[3255.07s -> 3255.87s]  Shit, I missed.
[3268.22s -> 3269.22s]  Give me more nuts.
[3270.75s -> 3271.45s]  Come on.
[3279.97s -> 3280.27s]  That's good.
[3280.27s -> 3280.57s]  That's good.
[3280.57s -> 3281.47s]  That's better than 20.
[3281.47s -> 3282.27s]  That's better than 19.
[3283.07s -> 3283.67s]  That's 24.
[3288.63s -> 3288.93s]  There we go.
[3288.93s -> 3289.23s]  All right.
[3289.23s -> 3290.13s]  Now let that just run.
[3290.13s -> 3292.03s]  Well, I'm going to make a ton of orange chocolate.
[3292.43s -> 3293.43s]  I have enough for six weeks.
[3293.43s -> 3295.53s]  I need more Moroccan coffee.
[3298.88s -> 3306.28s]  We need Moroccan coffee and I need to go hand this in to Tangier.
[3306.88s -> 3307.38s]  All right, let's go.
[3311.52s -> 3312.42s]  You're ignoring chat.
[3312.42s -> 3315.32s]  Yeah, because like all it is is just people saying like Obama raid.
[3316.02s -> 3317.52s]  What do you want me to pull out from here?
[3320.40s -> 3323.80s]  You want me to just stare at the chat while I just say Obama raid, Obama raid.
[3323.80s -> 3324.70s]  Look, it's Obama.
[3324.70s -> 3325.60s]  Obama's here.
[3325.60s -> 3326.60s]  Obama raid.
[3326.60s -> 3329.60s]  What kind of what am I pulling from the chat that I'm not seeing?
[3329.90s -> 3331.20s]  That I didn't see eight minutes ago.
[3335.60s -> 3336.20s]  Oh, hold on.
[3341.68s -> 3343.98s]  Good to see you back in Tangier, silly zonkawonka.
[3344.28s -> 3347.08s]  Listen, there will be some mighty fine cinnamon available here soon.
[3347.98s -> 3350.78s]  Now that's an ingredient used in loads of delicious coffee recipes.
[3351.08s -> 3354.28s]  In fact, I've got one such recipe for you here.
[3354.78s -> 3355.58s]  I give it to you now.
[3355.58s -> 3357.08s]  Will you be willing to do something for me?
[3357.38s -> 3362.71s]  Yep, cinnamon, cinnamon coffee.
[3362.71s -> 3364.11s]  People go nuts over this shit.
[3368.12s -> 3372.42s]  It's gonna make a regular coffee with a regular like just Folger's coffee beans
[3373.02s -> 3378.73s]  and then just tap two things of cinnamon on top of it and sell it for nine bucks.
[3380.24s -> 3383.64s]  Oh, wow.
[3383.64s -> 3384.64s]  Cinnamon coffee.
[3384.64s -> 3385.64s]  Yep, that'll be nine dollars.
[3389.88s -> 3390.98s]  60 cases.
[3398.99s -> 3399.99s]  No, they're not smelling.
[3399.99s -> 3401.29s]  No, it's not sniffing it.
[3402.32s -> 3402.92s]  They're not going.
[3404.02s -> 3404.92s]  I mean, they could be.
[3404.92s -> 3408.02s]  I'm sure that some people that buy coffee do that.
[3410.12s -> 3414.12s]  Swell brings 60 cases of chocolate with caramel here in town.
[3415.76s -> 3416.66s]  Oh, okay.
[3416.66s -> 3421.36s]  So I have to make 60 cases of caramel chocolate to get to unlock cinnamon.
[3422.56s -> 3422.96s]  Okay.
[3423.46s -> 3424.06s]  That's a lot.
[3427.84s -> 3428.24s]  It is here.
[3428.24s -> 3429.34s]  I delivered my 40.
[3431.24s -> 3438.84s]  Ooh, another recipe.
[3440.90s -> 3447.42s]  Coffee mint, coffee with mint, Colombian coffee, Moroccan coffee and mint.
[3447.92s -> 3448.62s]  I don't have any mint.
[3448.62s -> 3449.32s]  So whatever.
[3450.12s -> 3453.12s]  I think we should explore entering into a partnership for this shop.
[3454.16s -> 3455.56s]  It would be many benefits for you.
[3455.56s -> 3458.76s]  For starters, I'd always offer you the highest prices for your wares.
[3459.36s -> 3462.96s]  More importantly, I'd be able to start taking special orders on your behalf.
[3464.28s -> 3464.68s]  Really?
[3466.10s -> 3467.30s]  Special orders work like this.
[3467.30s -> 3472.60s]  I'll accept orders on your behalf and then send you a telegram with the details of each order as I receive them.
[3473.00s -> 3479.00s]  You can decide whether or not to accept each order, but I assure you special orders command the highest profit margins you will ever see.
[3480.59s -> 3484.59s]  I will incur some startup costs to get the special order system up and running.
[3485.09s -> 3487.69s]  If you're willing to share these costs by bringing me some products,
[3488.09s -> 3491.79s]  we'll be square and I'll be ready to enter into the partnership we discussed.
[3491.99s -> 3492.49s]  Deal?
[3498.30s -> 3498.60s]  Deal.
[3500.10s -> 3500.80s]  Splendid!
[3501.96s -> 3505.16s]  While I don't carry chocolates in my shop, I love them all the same.
[3505.56s -> 3510.16s]  First, bring me 100 cases of special reserve 66% African cocoa.
[3512.07s -> 3512.67s]  Holy shit.
[3513.17s -> 3513.97s]  This goes for a lot.
[3516.90s -> 3518.60s]  Oh wait, we're in a partnership, aren't we?
[3520.62s -> 3521.42s]  Oh, not yet.
[3528.89s -> 3529.79s]  I need, um...
[3530.49s -> 3531.39s]  I need Moroccan coffee.
[3532.52s -> 3533.02s]  Yes, it's true.
[3533.02s -> 3535.82s]  I'm expecting a new spice soon and I'd be happy to offer you for sale.
[3536.22s -> 3538.52s]  As soon as you show up with 60 cases of chocolate with caramel.
[3541.55s -> 3542.55s]  I need, um...
[3548.24s -> 3549.44s]  I need more coffee.
[3549.64s -> 3551.34s]  I need more, um, Moroccan coffee.
[3555.83s -> 3556.23s]  Okay.
[3558.70s -> 3559.20s]  That's a lot.
[3567.27s -> 3567.77s]  Yes!
[3569.93s -> 3570.33s]  Good deal.
[3572.46s -> 3574.76s]  So I need a lot of Moroccan coffee.
[3575.26s -> 3576.26s]  Let's do 200.
[3578.28s -> 3578.48s]  Okay.
[3578.48s -> 3578.68s]  Yeah.
[3578.78s -> 3579.08s]  Yep.
[3579.38s -> 3579.78s]  That's fine.
[3579.78s -> 3580.28s]  I'll make it back.
[3582.47s -> 3583.87s]  Can we get a battery cam?
[3587.52s -> 3588.02s]  No.
[3588.95s -> 3589.85s]  No, you can't.
[3590.45s -> 3592.75s]  No, there will be no battery cam.
[3598.45s -> 3598.65s]  All right.
[3598.65s -> 3599.75s]  This is going to keep producing.
[3600.49s -> 3600.99s]  I'm going to go.
[3600.99s -> 3601.49s]  I need it.
[3601.99s -> 3606.59s]  I'm going to go make a reserve recipe.
[3606.59s -> 3606.99s]  Hold on.
[3609.49s -> 3610.19s]  This is...
[3611.29s -> 3612.29s]  ...Dualan cocoa...
[3612.99s -> 3613.59s]  ...and sugar.
[3614.43s -> 3615.33s]  I have a ton...
[3615.33s -> 3616.13s]  I was prepared.
[3616.13s -> 3617.63s]  Remember I bought this at a discount and everyone said,
[3617.63s -> 3618.53s]  Jerma, don't buy that.
[3618.53s -> 3619.23s]  What are you buying that for?
[3619.23s -> 3620.23s]  I bought it at a discount.
[3620.23s -> 3621.23s]  I haggled with the guy.
[3621.43s -> 3622.43s]  Now I have a shitload of it.
[3622.63s -> 3623.43s]  I need a hundred of these.
[3625.24s -> 3625.84s]  Let's go back to Zurich.
[3637.52s -> 3638.02s]  Good price.
[3640.08s -> 3640.78s]  That's a good price.
[3646.17s -> 3647.07s]  That's a good price too.
[3650.40s -> 3651.70s]  72 cases of this shit.
[3652.40s -> 3652.70s]  Nice.
[3654.41s -> 3655.21s]  I'm holding onto this.
[3655.21s -> 3655.71s]  This is going to be...
[3655.71s -> 3657.71s]  I'm going to make so much money on this.
[3657.71s -> 3658.61s]  This would be, uh...
[3659.41s -> 3661.21s]  This would be like 50 times what I put in.
[3662.70s -> 3662.90s]  All right.
[3662.90s -> 3664.10s]  I need to make the...
[3664.90s -> 3665.60s]  ...this one here.
[3667.27s -> 3668.37s]  26 cases per week.
[3668.37s -> 3669.97s]  I don't need to do the thing.
[3670.07s -> 3670.67s]  That's good enough.
[3672.64s -> 3673.74s]  We want to see the battery.
[3674.04s -> 3674.54s]  No.
[3675.34s -> 3676.54s]  You don't need to see the battery.
[3679.62s -> 3679.92s]  All right.
[3679.92s -> 3680.52s]  Should I...
[3682.57s -> 3683.77s]  Do I have space to do?
[3685.44s -> 3686.84s]  No, I don't have any room.
[3686.84s -> 3688.24s]  Why can I delete these?
[3688.24s -> 3689.24s]  These are such junk.
[3689.24s -> 3690.04s]  I want to delete them.
[3696.52s -> 3697.72s]  Maybe I should just keep making this.
[3701.31s -> 3702.61s]  Open up a new factory.
[3706.46s -> 3707.66s]  What do I got for quest right now?
[3707.66s -> 3708.46s]  A new spice.
[3708.66s -> 3709.06s]  Okay.
[3711.12s -> 3713.92s]  I need 60 cases of the chocolate with caramel.
[3714.62s -> 3715.72s]  I'm doing this first.
[3716.85s -> 3718.65s]  Because I'm bringing 100 cases to this guy.
[3719.42s -> 3721.32s]  So then I get a partnership with this guy.
[3721.82s -> 3723.92s]  And then I can sell this Arabian Bold...
[3724.32s -> 3726.22s]  ...for the maximum profit to this guy.
[3730.07s -> 3730.57s]  Oh shit.
[3730.57s -> 3730.97s]  I forgot.
[3732.90s -> 3735.30s]  I need 24 cases of cafe con leche.
[3735.30s -> 3735.70s]  Shit.
[3737.37s -> 3738.57s]  I keep blowing that lady off.
[3738.97s -> 3739.27s]  Okay.
[3739.27s -> 3739.77s]  How much...
[3739.77s -> 3740.57s]  What does it take?
[3744.87s -> 3745.27s]  Cuban...
[3745.27s -> 3746.17s]  I need more Cuban coffee.
[3746.57s -> 3751.98s]  It's Cuban coffee, milk, and sugar.
[3752.48s -> 3752.68s]  All right.
[3752.68s -> 3753.28s]  Let's go to Cuba.
[3760.48s -> 3761.28s]  I don't have it yet.
[3761.68s -> 3764.29s]  Oh, wait.
[3767.90s -> 3768.90s]  Silly zonka wonka.
[3769.40s -> 3771.80s]  I understand whipped cream has recently become available.
[3771.90s -> 3774.20s]  I have a recipe here that uses that very ingredient.
[3774.60s -> 3775.90s]  Coffee with whipped cream.
[3776.40s -> 3777.40s]  What a recipe.
[3779.40s -> 3780.60s]  Wow.
[3781.08s -> 3783.78s]  Coffee with whipped cream on top?
[3784.45s -> 3785.55s]  What's the secret?
[3785.85s -> 3787.35s]  What are you holding back from us?
[3787.92s -> 3789.22s]  Holy smokes.
[3791.14s -> 3793.14s]  What do I need to get the secret from you?
[3794.58s -> 3796.68s]  If you'd be willing to take 28 cases to...
[3796.98s -> 3799.08s]  ...Nino Brager in Zurich...
[3799.38s -> 3800.68s]  ...he will pay you well for the goods.
[3800.68s -> 3801.38s]  Sure.
[3802.11s -> 3803.41s]  Oh, boy.
[3805.33s -> 3806.43s]  The secret recipe.
[3807.13s -> 3808.43s]  It's brew a coffee...
[3808.93s -> 3811.03s]  ...and then hold the can upside down and go...
[3814.20s -> 3816.50s]  ...only your great-great-great-grandmother knew that.
[3826.64s -> 3827.44s]  So expensive.
[3829.81s -> 3831.21s]  Although this is actually on the low end.
[3832.87s -> 3833.67s]  Last seen in...
[3834.07s -> 3834.37s]  Okay.
[3834.47s -> 3837.27s]  The last time I was here, this is $515 a stack.
[3840.50s -> 3842.30s]  Do I dare try to come down?
[3842.50s -> 3843.30s]  I mean, this is on the low end.
[3846.31s -> 3847.31s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[3847.31s -> 3848.21s]  It's already so good.
[3854.29s -> 3854.59s]  Here we go.
[3862.30s -> 3862.60s]  All right.
[3862.60s -> 3863.70s]  That was $100,000.
[3863.80s -> 3864.50s]  $100,000.
[3864.50s -> 3866.20s]  There's $520 grand in here.
[3866.96s -> 3869.36s]  There's a hundred fucking thousand dollars on the line.
[3870.16s -> 3870.86s]  Just do not...
[3870.86s -> 3871.96s]  There's three Whammies here.
[3871.96s -> 3872.86s]  Don't click a Whammy.
[3873.56s -> 3873.96s]  All right.
[3880.01s -> 3880.71s]  Okay, we're almost...
[3881.71s -> 3882.01s]  All right.
[3882.01s -> 3882.21s]  All right.
[3882.21s -> 3882.51s]  All right.
[3882.51s -> 3882.81s]  All right.
[3883.45s -> 3884.15s]  I'm up.
[3884.55s -> 3884.95s]  One more.
[3885.75s -> 3886.05s]  I'm done.
[3890.73s -> 3891.73s]  Oh, fuck yeah.
[3896.45s -> 3897.25s]  Oh, hell yeah.
[3897.25s -> 3898.15s]  That felt good.
[3898.95s -> 3899.55s]  That felt good.
[3901.90s -> 3903.20s]  I haven't really used any Allspice.
[3906.53s -> 3907.53s]  Let us choose.
[3909.50s -> 3910.70s]  It's gonna be really hard to do.
[3911.30s -> 3911.60s]  I would...
[3911.60s -> 3917.20s]  I really want to do that, but like alt-tabbing and turning on the extension and getting it to be in the right spot might be hard.
[3919.32s -> 3919.72s]  We'll see.
[3919.92s -> 3920.72s]  Maybe I'll do it later.
[3923.00s -> 3924.40s]  Thank you, James, for the ten community...
[3924.40s -> 3924.90s]  Oh, sorry.
[3924.90s -> 3926.60s]  Thank you, James, for the ten community subs.
[3927.56s -> 3927.96s]  Thanks a lot.
[3929.17s -> 3930.07s]  Ten fucking subs.
[3931.22s -> 3931.62s]  Thanks you.
[3931.92s -> 3932.42s]  Thanks you.
[3933.12s -> 3933.62s]  Thanks you.
[3935.39s -> 3936.69s]  I thanks you.
[3938.14s -> 3938.94s]  He hates us.
[3938.94s -> 3939.94s]  No, I don't.
[3939.94s -> 3941.64s]  I just hate alt-tabbing.
[3944.37s -> 3945.17s]  No, don't sell.
[3946.61s -> 3947.01s]  All right.
[3947.01s -> 3951.48s]  I have to bring $100,000 using whipped cream.
[3954.78s -> 3955.48s]  Yeah, this guy just...
[3956.18s -> 3958.78s]  Don't you feel like you want to go visit this guy and just pull him aside and be like,
[3960.26s -> 3965.66s]  Nino, just buy the whipped cream and just put it on top of your coffee.
[3965.66s -> 3967.06s]  You don't need me to do this for you.
[3967.87s -> 3968.17s]  I don't...
[3968.17s -> 3968.77s]  You don't have...
[3968.77s -> 3970.47s]  I don't have to do this part for you.
[3975.18s -> 3975.38s]  All right.
[3975.38s -> 3975.98s]  So let's do...
[3975.98s -> 3980.08s]  We're looking for $100,000, which we have $26,000.
[3980.08s -> 3980.88s]  It's gonna take a few weeks.
[3985.68s -> 3986.38s]  I need to just...
[3987.88s -> 3989.38s]  I'm gonna just travel around and get ingredients.
[3989.98s -> 3990.68s]  What am I low on?
[3991.15s -> 3992.05s]  I'm about to sneeze again.
[3992.78s -> 3993.88s]  I didn't even sneeze once today.
[3994.59s -> 3995.39s]  Why am I saying again?
[4004.90s -> 4008.76s]  What about the lady?
[4011.30s -> 4012.50s]  You got her killed.
[4019.99s -> 4023.39s]  Somebody came in here and like killed me and muted the microphone right by...
[4023.39s -> 4023.89s]  How?
[4027.40s -> 4029.30s]  I would probably have made more noise than that.
[4040.70s -> 4042.30s]  A dagger thrown into me?
[4042.60s -> 4043.20s]  Yeah, but wouldn't...
[4043.20s -> 4047.40s]  Okay, if a dagger was thrown across the room, like into my neck, I wouldn't be...
[4047.70s -> 4048.40s]  I would be like...
[4051.90s -> 4052.50s]  I would be like...
[4055.64s -> 4056.14s]  Wouldn't I?
[4059.84s -> 4061.44s]  It was a laser weapon.
[4066.53s -> 4068.23s]  Yeah, it was like a vaporizing ray.
[4068.73s -> 4074.03s]  I look over, I see this big green alien with like a big like Mars attacks head.
[4075.12s -> 4075.92s]  He just goes like...
[4078.48s -> 4079.68s]  I see him and I see the beam.
[4079.68s -> 4080.48s]  That's all you get.
[4081.34s -> 4082.54s]  I got discombobulated.

[4824.90s -> 4826.42s]  sustainable internal
[4826.42s -> 4830.78s]  Like it they like back to like a lemon juice is so sour and so acidic
[4831.22s -> 4834.14s]  Like it cannot go bad because it kills all the bacteria and germs in the middle
[4834.38s -> 4839.74s]  Why do I have this weird thing that as long as the skins on they have like a whole ecosystem where they can be?
[4839.74s -> 4845.14s]  Like clean in there. I know that's not true. But why do I think it could be?
[4850.93s -> 4852.37s]  immortal lemons
[4852.37s -> 4858.80s]  Because you're dumb. No, it was it's just a little thought project. I know that lemons go bad
[4858.80s -> 4863.80s]  I'm just saying like I why is it my mind a lemon is like this ecosystem that is

[4931.50s -> 4940.30s]  Mocha use this recipe 32 a week. That's fine. Look at how much of this I have
[4940.98s -> 4947.43s]  359 Arabian bold cases, but that's not single coffees. That's stacks of this those cases
[4948.07s -> 4956.20s]  How many coffees are in a case? I have no idea trying not to burp on camera. This is like
[4956.84s -> 4963.85s]  3500 coffee. Oh black tea is going bad too. Great
[4968.41s -> 4976.53s]  Whipped cream I need to get that secret whipped cream recipe. What about the cafe con leche? I'm that's not
[4977.29s -> 4986.58s]  That's not a precedent right now. That's the wrong word. Okay, I got that going. Let's head back to
[4987.36s -> 5001.65s]  Need a hundred sprite sponges. Wait, doesn't somebody else want sprite sponges too? Oh tar the moon, right?
[5001.81s -> 5008.14s]  This is what this is the most important one is something else I can do
[5008.62s -> 5013.55s]  I'm trying to find cheap
[5013.99s -> 5030.56s]  I could use more. Oh, I could use my dwelling cocoa or I have I don't have any Cuban coffee
[5030.56s -> 5052.39s]  Let's go to Havana. No links tonight. Nope, not right now. Holy shit. Holy shit. Holy shit. Holy shit. That's $400,000
[5052.39s -> 5054.87s]  Oh my god, that's 400 grand. Holy shit. I must get a million dollars
[5056.94s -> 5064.76s]  Wow. Oh, wow. Okay. Don't I'm never gambling ever again in the game because that's like half a million dollars almost
[5064.88s -> 5076.76s]  It's a lot of coffee. Why is tea so expensive? Listen friend. I just harvested it. Oh
[5083.62s -> 5090.35s]  Like I just walked into the store and bumped my elbow on the like the side opening the door to the shop
[5090.37s -> 5097.88s]  It's the dagger the reaction instead of being like
[5100.54s -> 5102.78s]  No, no, no, it's how
[5103.26s -> 5114.78s]  Then I'm dead. Listen friend. I just harvested a bumper crop of coffee beans here
[5114.82s -> 5118.85s]  There's not a whole lot I can do on the price, but I'd be willing to trade
[5119.65s -> 5122.69s]  5,000 sacks of
[5122.69s -> 5132.73s]  Cuban coffee for 75 cases of special blend. Are you kidding me? That's five
[5133.37s -> 5140.70s]  Okay, hold on. It's like 300 to 400 bucks a sack. I need to do some calculation here. It's like
[5142.66s -> 5148.56s]  $340 a sec to 340 times 5,000
[5148.60s -> 5156.11s]  That's one point seven million dollars of product for just 75 cases of special blend
[5156.11s -> 5164.90s]  How much does it cost to make special blend? Isn't special blend just all three of them? Holy shit. That's incredible

[9584.62s -> 9585.90s]  Make that better
[9585.90s -> 9587.74s]  I'm gonna be laggy
[9587.74s -> 9591.77s]  Remember the type of guy to eat nuggets without sauce
[9606.09s -> 9607.31s]  I mean
[9607.31s -> 9609.47s]  Do you eat every single nugget with sauce?
[9613.44s -> 9626.43s]  I don't I would say 60% of every 70 to 60% of every nugget is dipped in sauce. Sometimes you just want a nugget
[9627.92s -> 9629.92s]  Not every single one has to be dipped in sauce
[9630.16s -> 9652.44s]  How many raspberries?
[9652.44s -> 9664.84s]  Cereal killer behavior. I I don't dip every single nugget into sweet and sour or something usually I do
[9665.72s -> 9667.72s]  And by the way, how many sauces?
[9667.72s -> 9676.25s]  Are we talking here? Do we do you guys do one sauce? Do you do two sauces three different sauces? How many I would say two to three?
[9677.82s -> 9679.34s]  Usually it's about two
[9679.34s -> 9683.36s]  Usually it's for me. It's if uh, if it's a like McNuggets
[9684.00s -> 9686.30s]  sweet and sour sauce
[9686.30s -> 9687.50s]  and
[9687.50s -> 9689.50s]  Maybe honey mustard barbecue
[9689.66s -> 9704.60s]  Depends on how I feel the sweet and sour sauce from mcdonald's is the best that you can find anywhere. It's based
[9704.68s -> 9710.67s]  Well, no, that's yeah, of course it is
[9710.67s -> 9712.11s]  There it is
[9712.11s -> 9715.87s]  There's the whiskey. I am about to do something insane
[9718.36s -> 9719.64s]  Okay, so
[9719.64s -> 9723.10s]  We got irish coffee
[9723.40s -> 9728.25s]  300 i'm gonna get are you ready for this? Are you guys ready?
[9728.81s -> 9733.63s]  We're gonna haggle. I'm gonna I don't imagine you're doing much business with these outlandish prices
[9734.35s -> 9739.88s]  Again, hey, here's how this is gonna work you help me a bit on your price. I'll buy the ingredients
[9740.60s -> 9749.31s]  Thank you
[9749.31s -> 9756.46s]  400 bottles of whiskey make a custom. That's just three whiskies
[9757.02s -> 9765.05s]  In fact, we're gonna do 500 bottles of whiskey. I got a good deal here
[9765.69s -> 9771.88s]  Do I need any more of this stuff? Maybe some more cherries?
[9777.60s -> 9779.47s]  All right. That's it
[9779.47s -> 9782.67s]  22 sacks of milk. That's a good deal. I'll take
[9783.31s -> 9794.76s]  I'll take 500
[9794.76s -> 9806.83s]  Alcohol doesn't go bad. And what kind of coffee is irish coffee?
[9809.58s -> 9815.85s]  Alcohol just gets better with age
[9815.85s -> 9819.61s]  The recipe for irish coffee is 600. I need cream
[9820.25s -> 9823.85s]  I don't even need to look at the coffee. So I just need a little bit more cream. I need like 200 300 more cream
[9825.32s -> 9827.50s]  Good. All right
[9827.50s -> 9831.90s]  We've got this being made our quest is for 45 cases. It'll be done
[9832.30s -> 9835.10s]  We're gonna go down and make cinnamon coffee down in capetown right now
[9846.22s -> 9853.31s]  Cinnamon coffee plenty Moroccan coffee plenty of sugar plenty of cinnamon use this one. Here we go
[9857.98s -> 9859.98s]  Ingredients that are not alcohol will go bad
[9860.54s -> 9864.88s]  I'll just i'm gonna put it in like a bunch of oak barrels. I'll just put it back in the barrel
[9878.78s -> 9880.94s]  Oh my god, you know, I what do you think I was?
[9885.18s -> 9898.09s]  So annoying
[9898.09s -> 9907.34s]  Oh my god
[9907.34s -> 9922.20s]  No, i'm trying to go here. All right. These are among us kill sounds
[9927.48s -> 9929.64s]  All right. So by the time that I fly
[9931.18s -> 9933.18s]  To back to tokyo
[9934.27s -> 9939.31s]  I will have the inventory that she requires what else I need to go back to tokyo with something else
[9944.38s -> 9947.58s]  Okay
[9947.58s -> 9953.66s]  I need 60 cases of mocha shit. All right, we're going
[9954.62s -> 9968.43s]  We're going going back to tokyo so I can take I can trade this in I don't have enough
[9968.91s -> 9970.59s]  Okay, I was gonna say what?
[9970.59s -> 9975.07s]  Trade these in there you are

[9981.40s -> 9983.08s]  And cherry. Yes
[9983.08s -> 9986.52s]  I knew it. I told you guys it's gonna be cherries. I'm gonna make a shit load of these
[9987.26s -> 9989.12s]  I can make these now
[9989.12s -> 9994.00s]  So i'm gonna do cherry we're gonna make a ton of cherries ton of them
[9994.73s -> 10002.33s]  Like a 300 of these i'm gonna make them right now if we often host special events here at the tower
[10002.65s -> 10005.84s]  In fact, I could use 45 cases each
[10006.40s -> 10010.94s]  Of the infusion recipes I gave you that's not enough a hundred thousand
[10011.58s -> 10013.58s]  Make that a million 45 cases each
[10023.40s -> 10026.68s]  That would be almost a hundred k that's 90 cases of what she just did
[10027.40s -> 10030.86s]  I can get way more than that. No, thanks
[10030.86s -> 10036.80s]  All right, let's actually do the uh, let's get it rolling the things about your success

[11850.19s -> 11852.43s]  And there's enough for me just to just keep this on forever
[11853.34s -> 11856.86s]  All right. They are making these how many of these do I own now a lot probably
[11857.98s -> 11861.68s]  187 who wants these who would buy these at a decent price?

[11906.70s -> 11909.34s]  Trust me having an outpost here in hawaii will be great for your business
[11909.66s -> 11915.34s]  We see a lot of tourists, especially tourists with disposable dollars for confections. There's one last thing i'll need to you to do
[11916.06s -> 11919.98s]  Bring me 50 cases each of chocolate with honey arabium bold

[11982.33s -> 11989.95s]  Excellent. They are even better than I had led to believe
[11990.43s -> 11997.77s]  Here's a recipe I mentioned for refreshing dark columbian cocoa lime infusions. Nice. Okay
[12000.44s -> 12012.52s]  My infusions are way better though. Can you bring me 45 cases? I'll give you a second one. You guys like cherries
[12018.48s -> 12022.03s]  No
[12022.03s -> 12024.03s]  Why does nobody want these?
[12030.96s -> 12033.52s]  My god, I got 200 200 i'm all right for now

[12052.40s -> 12056.04s]  This order is absurd
[12058.83s -> 12060.83s]  Chocolate bars with peanuts

[12123.15s -> 12125.15s]  I'm missing like this is such a horrible loss
[12125.63s -> 12130.52s]  They keep making irish coffees. They're probably worth a shitload
[12132.88s -> 12133.84s]  They are

[12154.36s -> 12157.26s]  Are you kidding me?
[12157.26s -> 12161.50s]  Cinnamon coffee is worth more than an irish coffee irish coffee has whiskey in it

[12228.08s -> 12230.06s]  I just do it
[12230.06s -> 12234.06s]  Putting in the maximum that I can do or putting a price it shows you and I'd like to see it
[12237.05s -> 12240.25s]  Uh, i'm gonna hold it for now. No, i'm not get rid of all of it

[12292.70s -> 12296.78s]  That's such a low price. It's a thousand bucks. It's like 1300 bucks for cherries
[12297.66s -> 12304.33s]  Can I just take a loss here?
[12304.33s -> 12310.88s]  I'm sure I just hold it

[17855.29s -> 17864.75s]  Terrible RNG. Just awful. Really awful. It's truly terrible RNG. Like, what a disaster.
[17865.23s -> 17925.36s]  Let's do it again. Much better. Much better RNG. So much better! Oh, it's like the God run.
[17925.36s -> 17939.20s]  Come on. Something, something. Please, please, please. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[17940.24s -> 17951.88s]  All right. 40 cases a week. That's good. Let's get a shitload of ginger. That'll produce for a long time.
[17953.74s -> 17955.74s]  They are worth a lot. So that's good.
[17956.30s -> 17964.65s]  Breakfast blend is still just cranking out at 37 per week. Hazelnut chocolate bar. Look at all these white truffles.
[17969.34s -> 17975.12s]  I can just sell them. All right. So here's the plan. We're gonna go get more Bolognese and Colombian coffee.
[17982.97s -> 17989.28s]  Finally found the mangoes.
[17989.28s -> 17991.28s]  There they are. Finally.
[17991.44s -> 17994.76s]  What was it? Mango what? Mango clove.
[17997.45s -> 18001.45s]  Have 100 clove. Let's get a bunch of cloves. Let's do it. Let's buy it. Let's make a ton of these.
[18002.17s -> 18004.17s]  I'm gonna get 500 cloves, 500 mangoes.
[18004.73s -> 18021.93s]  Can you do something for me with these prices? God damn it. We're gonna make a shitload of those.
[18022.49s -> 18027.04s]  So mango clove infusion.
[18030.17s -> 18032.17s]  I'm just gonna make a ton.
[18033.02s -> 18035.82s]  Oh, these are going. They'll be going for a little while. We can sell the hell out of them.
[18036.67s -> 18038.83s]  I feel like Jerm is streaming this game to himself.
[18041.84s -> 18046.40s]  I mean, I'm just trying to play the game. I'm trying to make money here.
[18047.77s -> 18051.15s]  I'm streaming.
[18051.15s -> 18055.31s]  I'm just like talking. I'm not even streaming. I'm just like, okay, so we're gonna go over this way.
[18056.03s -> 18061.95s]  He read chat for once. Yeah, I'm making big fucking bucks about two million dollars. I'm up to two mil.
[18068.04s -> 18070.04s]  Chats are sitting here doing Jupiters.
[18073.79s -> 18078.19s]  Yeah, well chat's just sitting there doing Jupiters. I'm making big money.
[18078.91s -> 18082.89s]  I got almost 200 breakfast blends. Are you kidding me?
[18090.81s -> 18093.37s]  Now we're gonna go get uh, Colombian coffee.
[18095.45s -> 18103.95s]  To Bogota we go. Honestly, it's been five hours. I feel like I've been sitting here for 10 minutes.
[18104.51s -> 18116.86s]  This is his new favorite game.
[18116.86s -> 18122.89s]  It's a new yeah, a new mango. All right, let's keep that going. I'm gonna go to sell
[18124.28s -> 18126.20s]  in Kona.
[18126.20s -> 18128.43s]  It's over here.
[18128.43s -> 18132.03s]  This is my new favorite game. This is like my new favorite. It is
[18133.34s -> 18134.30s]  close.
[18134.30s -> 18137.50s]  All right, check this shit out.
[18137.50s -> 18141.74s]  Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. You guys ready to cross at least the three million mark?
[18142.38s -> 18148.81s]  Here it comes.
[18148.81s -> 18152.73s]  Look at this breakfast blend. Dark chocolate infusion with ginger.
[18153.29s -> 18162.56s]  Let's cross three million. What do you say?
[18162.80s -> 18164.80s]  Don't sell this here. The coffee shop guy has a better price.
[18176.67s -> 18178.67s]  Yeah, coffee shop guy has a much better price.
[18183.68s -> 18186.80s]  Whatever. I just messed up. I was gonna do 200, but I did 320. Don't care.
[18187.12s -> 18197.61s]  The rain streamer is panic selling all of his stocks. I want to go change the recipe to this.
[18197.69s -> 18205.31s]  So we have to go to Tokyo. First we're gonna take a stop in Cape Town. No, why am I going to Cape Town?
[18205.63s -> 18211.28s]  Where are the new recipes coming from? I don't know. I didn't want to go here.
[18212.44s -> 18223.21s]  Messed up.
[18223.21s -> 18225.21s]  Over three million dollars.
[18225.45s -> 18231.71s]  Today was supposed to be a fun connect stream, not some shitty chocolate game I'd find on my grandma's PC. Band that person.
[18232.57s -> 18246.22s]  Or at least an hour.
[18246.22s -> 18248.22s]  No, you know what? We'll dial it back to
[18248.94s -> 18252.62s]  20 minutes. You have to face the truth.
[18256.96s -> 18258.96s]  What?
[18259.60s -> 18263.68s]  I'd like the chocolate money making simulator.
[18267.98s -> 18270.54s]  If I'm playing connect tomorrow, it's okay. Look.
[18271.26s -> 18272.94s]  This is not okay.
[18272.94s -> 18279.50s]  I didn't say guys today we're gonna play chocolatier again. Oh, and by the way, I've burnt the connect.
[18279.90s -> 18285.18s]  I put it into a giant fucking steel trash can along with all the connect games and I light them on fire.
[18286.81s -> 18291.61s]  I smashed it. I stomped on it like grapes and I made fucking connect wine. That didn't happen.
[18292.80s -> 18294.80s]  It's right behind me. We're doing it tomorrow.
[18298.33s -> 18300.88s]  But now
[18300.88s -> 18301.76s]  I'm
[18301.76s -> 18304.48s]  enjoying making chocolates and getting five million dollars.
[18305.60s -> 18310.88s]  So here's what happens. Once I get to five million dollars, I'm going to go gamble until I get to 10 million or turn the stream off.
[18311.28s -> 18323.50s]  That's what's gonna happen. I'm gonna save it first because I like this game. It's kind of fun.
[18326.01s -> 18334.65s]  So now we gotta we gotta do the- what are you doing Otto? Almost running out of breakfast blend. Let's take it. We'll go to Tokyo.
[18337.45s -> 18339.95s]  Yeah, I want to do the mango.
[18340.03s -> 18344.75s]  Oh, nice Otto. I want to sneeze. I'm not about to sneeze.
[18345.31s -> 18378.78s]  Here we go. This is gonna be a big big money maker I got. I'm gonna make 500 of these. I need snowballs.
[18379.26s -> 18405.56s]  They're trying to make it harder on me. They're trying to make it harder.
[18412.40s -> 18429.98s]  Shit. Okay. Come on. Get me higher than 50 cases. I just need the cases.
[18431.68s -> 18443.15s]  51 cases. Bingo. There we are. 51 cases. Time to go
[18443.79s -> 18453.77s]  turn this in to Tangiers. Breakfast blend.
[18454.33s -> 18459.29s]  Come on, give me five million.
[18459.29s -> 18462.97s]  You silly zonkawonka. You're a gifted chocolatier. Here's the recipe I mentioned.
[18462.97s -> 18465.93s]  It may be a while before you can get a hold of all these specialty Cocos, but it'll be worth it.
[18467.48s -> 18470.36s]  Ooh blended cocoa dark chocolate infusion.
[18471.00s -> 18484.81s]  I'm not- I don't- where's Peruvian cocoa? Oh need more Moroccan coffee. No, we don't.
[18485.45s -> 18495.80s]  I need Bolognese and Colombian. Bolognese and Colombian. Okay, Bolognese coffee. I need hazelnuts.
[18501.34s -> 18503.98s]  Fuck, that wasn't a hazelnut. That was a nutmeg.
[18508.94s -> 18510.94s]  That's a lot.
[18511.58s -> 18513.98s]  Can we make a nutmeg chocolate by any chance?
[18514.62s -> 18530.35s]  Oh, thank god digging for gold is nutmeg. I need hazelnuts.
[18530.91s -> 18540.17s]  All right, Bolognese coffee, Colombian coffee.
[18540.81s -> 18547.52s]  Go.
[18547.52s -> 18549.92s]  Uh, give me better deal where I'm getting out. No.
[18550.88s -> 18572.28s]  God damn it. I need it. I have to do it. I- it's- I'm gonna- I'll make it back. I need it.
[18572.76s -> 18586.54s]  We need Colombian coffee. You got owned. I did.
[18587.10s -> 18597.69s]  Okay, maybe he won't be mad at me anymore if I go back there. Let's see.
[18599.93s -> 18602.41s]  Can you haggle somebody until they give up on their business?
[18603.21s -> 18605.37s]  Oh fuck, let's go to Wellington. I haven't even been here yet.
[18605.93s -> 18615.10s]  I didn't even give up on their business. You're doing swell silly zonkawonka and I very much look forward to working with you soon to launch our exotics.
[18618.84s -> 18620.04s]  God.
[18620.04s -> 18625.55s]  What do you mean launch your exotics?
[18630.76s -> 18633.16s]  Past the whiskey. It's all- wait, it went bad.
[18635.68s -> 18637.68s]  I had 500 whiskey and it went bad.
[18640.17s -> 18642.17s]  I bought these for like
[18643.19s -> 18647.22s]  $200,000.
[18648.67s -> 18655.50s]  I'm very bad at this, but it's still fun. It doesn't matter. I'm just losing money.
[18656.14s -> 18658.30s]  Hand over fist. Whatever that saying is.
[18662.97s -> 18664.73s]  Should've done some good success.
[18664.73s -> 18676.48s]  What else do I have to do here?
[18676.48s -> 18677.60s]  All right, here we go.
[18677.60s -> 18683.84s]  I'm going all the way back to flying across the whole world. You seem to be in a big hurry.
[18684.40s -> 18696.36s]  Three million, four million. Let's go.
[18698.24s -> 18700.62s]  Come on.
[18700.62s -> 18706.96s]  Four million coming on. There's so many truffles.
[18708.27s -> 18710.27s]  That's four million. I'm- we're almost there.
[18711.31s -> 18713.31s]  Somebody tell you the casino guy looks like you.
[18713.63s -> 18751.77s]  The raid? Did I sell everything? Was there a raid? It was. From the gray fruit.
[18753.42s -> 18759.52s]  Hey, I got- I got plenty of gray fruits on me right now. Thanks for the raid, dude. Take a look. Wait, that's not gray.
[18759.52s -> 18766.99s]  That's- do I have a gray fruit? I thought I had a gray fruit. Well, this one's kind of gray. Thanks for the raid.
[18768.64s -> 18770.86s]  Welcome everybody.
[18770.86s -> 18775.10s]  We are getting, uh, to- we're trying to get to five million dollars in the chocolate game.
[18776.78s -> 18780.54s]  And in the chocolate game, when you get to five million dollars, you go to the casino and you spend it so you get to 10,
[18780.54s -> 18788.30s]  or you turn the stream off. That's what's gonna happen. You're losing your vision? That's gray right there.
[18790.08s -> 18800.06s]  I didn't say the whole fruit was gray. That's- this is gray. Right there is gray. That's not green. What are you talking about?
[18802.52s -> 18803.64s]  This is
[18803.64s -> 18805.64s]  orange, like a red orange
[18806.28s -> 18808.36s]  into a peach color into gray.
[18813.08s -> 18823.87s]  Are you- is your computer screen okay? That's not green. That's not- that's gray. That's like a- that's like- what are you talking about?
[18827.90s -> 18832.78s]  That's not green. Are you- okay. That's green. That's gray.
[18833.88s -> 18840.20s]  This is green. That's gray. This is green. That's gray. How is this- how is what- where my cursor is right now?
[18841.21s -> 18848.14s]  How is it green? That's not green? You guys have liars. You're just fucking with me.
[18848.38s -> 18856.36s]  All right, what was I even doing? Oh, right, right, right, right, right. Getting to- getting to five million dollars.
[18856.60s -> 18867.98s]  What- okay, I need to- truffles, truffles, truffles, truffles, truffles, truffles, truffles, truffles. Here we are.
[18868.06s -> 18876.04s]  All right, I want to make the Bowser one. Spicy current truffles. I'm going to currents cayenne peppers.
[18876.28s -> 18888.46s]  I'm going to go to Wellington. Wellington, we're going to do this. Screen cap it and eyedrop tool and paint it.
[18888.46s -> 18893.10s]  Look at the RGB value. One of you will do it and then I- I'm gladly- we'll show it on stream.
[18896.25s -> 18921.04s]  What are you crazy? Okay, is that what I needed? Two hundred, two hundred,
[18921.66s -> 18928.17s]  six thousand, six thousand, seven hundred. All right, I need a button. I'm gonna get five hundred, five hundred, five hundred.
[18932.78s -> 18944.78s]  Let's go for- how many do I have? Come on, one more. This- this is gonna be the big ticket. Now I need powder.
[18944.86s -> 18955.48s]  It's hex zero, zero. Put your money where your mouth is. Let's be a hundred million that it's green according to an RGB value.
[18956.49s -> 18961.79s]  But here's the thing though. What if it is green on the RGB scale, but it's like a gray green?
[18963.31s -> 18967.92s]  Take- the RGB is
[18968.00s -> 18969.28s]  has- is hash.
[18969.28s -> 18978.12s]  Hold on. Green is- that's still green. But wait, wait, hold on. But if it's- if it's green-
[18979.20s -> 18981.20s]  But if it's gray too, then why am I wrong?
[18981.74s -> 18985.58s]  How come you get to be right if it's green in there, but I get to be wrong if there's gray in there?
[18985.90s -> 18991.69s]  That's not fair.
[18991.69s -> 18993.13s]  Because it's green.
[18993.13s -> 18998.68s]  Why can't it be- I can't be both color? It's green. It's gray. Life isn't fair.
[19000.94s -> 19008.28s]  You said it was gray. Show it to me. Give me the RGB value. I want to see it. Gray isn't a color, buddy. Oh, sorry.
[19011.23s -> 19013.95s]  Sorry. Gray is not a color, I guess.
[19016.00s -> 19025.60s]  It's- what is it? Five five something? Give me one sec. I'm all tapping for this.
[19029.44s -> 19030.80s]  It is
[19030.80s -> 19035.08s]  hash five five?
[19035.08s -> 19042.75s]  Oh, do me again? Turning links on. Does anybody have it? Five e-
[19045.07s -> 19060.22s]  Five e five seven three d. Is that a lie? Is that the right one? Five e five seven three d. Bullshit. That's not even right.
[19060.46s -> 19067.71s]  That's not even correct.
[19067.71s -> 19072.38s]  That's a troll color. You're fucking with me.
[19073.37s -> 19076.09s]  That's not what color- that's not the right color. By the way, that's like yellow.
[19076.09s -> 19079.85s]  That's not even- you guys were- you guys were wrong. If you think it's that one, that's yellow.
[19080.25s -> 19087.37s]  It's five five- somebody got the right one. Let me see it.
[19091.26s -> 19093.82s]  Five five five twenty three e.
[19095.07s -> 19097.55s]  Five five five twenty three e.
[19100.67s -> 19102.67s]  I don't- no, that's not right. You just picked it.
[19102.75s -> 19121.00s]  Give a discord- I want a- I want an image. I demand it. I command it. You changed- that's not what it looks like on my screen.
[19121.64s -> 19127.00s]  Can I screenshot mine? Is my color wrong on my computer?
[19129.72s -> 19147.44s]  It doesn't look like this on my screen. That doesn't look like that. Why is yours way darker?
[19148.24s -> 19157.21s]  Does it look like that?
[19157.21s -> 19159.37s]  Mine is- mine's way lighter than that.
[19163.96s -> 19177.32s]  I'm gonna take a screenshot. Everybody hold on a second. Print screen.
[19179.63s -> 19184.11s]  Hold on. I'm gonna put this up next to this.
[19184.67s -> 19209.92s]  I feel like this is- I think that this is- this is- this is a lie. Hold on. A crop? Is it the same picture?
[19235.21s -> 19240.97s]  Um, so the- my monitor- my monitor's colors are
[19241.61s -> 19252.36s]  fucked up bad. It is not- it is incredibly- it's five times lighter when I look at it. Boy.
[19252.68s -> 19268.38s]  This is the image I just took.
[19268.38s -> 19270.38s]  And in fact, I think this is darker.
[19274.01s -> 19280.25s]  All right, but just do me a favor. Do me a quick little favor here, and I know you say green, green, green.
[19280.73s -> 19284.73s]  Green, green, green. But what is right- what is that? What's that right there?
[19285.21s -> 19295.96s]  That little sliver there? That little white area? What is that? What color could be in there?
[19297.87s -> 19306.04s]  Gray. My monitor's fucked. It's way lighter on my screen.
[19306.60s -> 19308.64s]  That's mold.
[19308.64s -> 19318.33s]  Whatever. I don't even care.
[19318.33s -> 19322.49s]  I was- all right. Well, a good thing I didn't bet- I didn't bet any money.
[19325.32s -> 19330.33s]  What- what the fuck happened? How did we get here? What's going on? Why am I doing this right now?
[19330.73s -> 19333.10s]  Why do I care about the grapefruit?
[19333.18s -> 19341.12s]  Oh, that's somebody's name! That's somebody raided the channel! Hey, that was the grapefruit raided the channel!
[19343.23s -> 19352.40s]  Thanks for the raid, dude. Appreciate it. We're gonna, uh, keep going. Close that out. All right, let's make this bigger.
[19359.37s -> 19363.29s]  Oh shit, I have to close this.
[19363.29s -> 19376.27s]  Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
[19379.60s -> 19385.12s]  All right, we're back. What was the last thing that I just did?
[19386.20s -> 19390.04s]  All right, I need a shitload of truffle powder, and I'm good to go.
[19390.86s -> 19392.86s]  Truffle powder. Give it to me. Who's got it?
[19394.89s -> 19396.57s]  This'll take us
[19396.57s -> 19398.65s]  over five billion,
[19398.65s -> 19400.33s]  and then-
[19400.33s -> 19410.35s]  Oh, yep. This'll take us over five million, and I'm ready to spend money. Let's go back to Tokyo.
[19411.72s -> 19416.72s]  Tokyo. No, San Francisco, right? San Frans- no, we need to go to Tokyo for a second.
