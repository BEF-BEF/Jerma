[2818.38s -> 2823.50s]  i first started watching you most people is because of your tf2 memes but for me i wanted
[2823.50s -> 2828.54s]  to know how to be a better spy and five years ago when i first found you i was actually taking your
[2828.54s -> 2834.86s]  gameplay with utmost seriousness at first i didn't bother with your funny vids and i wasn't into the
[2834.86s -> 2840.17s]  tuber formula at the time but then i found a video where you showed art and that you were a
[2840.17s -> 2848.58s]  person the rest is history thanks for keeping me alive thanks a lot glad you could enjoy those
[2848.58s -> 2858.81s]  old videos and yes those old videos do have some good advice hey everyone's saying dude those old
[2858.81s -> 2862.89s]  videos gave wicked bad advice you don't actually want to play that was back before anybody was
[2862.89s -> 2871.96s]  given advice it's like if you if what if i'm the if you if i'm the only doctor in town you're
[2871.96s -> 2882.17s]  coming to me there are no other doctors you're coming to me and then eventually like other
[2882.17s -> 2887.77s]  doctors put up shop and are way better of a doctor than i am but i mean i gave some decent doctor
[2887.77s -> 2897.99s]  advice for how to play tf2 and then that doctor uh realizes that other doctors in the area can
[2897.99s -> 2905.56s]  perform the surgery better than he can so he goes into stand-up comedy and he remembers all the
[2905.56s -> 2917.11s]  times that he told the jokes to his patients and they laughed and then he took out the wrong organ
[2917.11s -> 2922.31s]  and then he became a fucking famous stand-up comedian doctor who's not a doctor anybody
[2922.31s -> 2926.31s]  didn't need to be a doctor he didn't even need to be a doctor anymore you can just be a comedian

[3517.82s -> 3523.34s]  try to make this drive it has to interest me i'm not gonna turn this stream on just because
[3524.22s -> 3541.34s]  i need to or have to in quotes right that's not gonna happen he's a diva so i don't want to do
