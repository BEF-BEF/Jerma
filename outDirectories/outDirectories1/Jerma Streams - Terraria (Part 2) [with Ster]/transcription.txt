[1.27s -> 7.45s]  Hello everybody. Hi. Hope you're doing well. Sorry for starting late.
[9.06s -> 14.50s]  We had some multiplayer issues. We were just sitting here figuring it out. I think we figured
[14.50s -> 23.74s]  it out. We're good. Thankfully didn't take too long, but we kept on getting disconnected to
[23.74s -> 29.58s]  each other. Had to try some. Okay. Well, hey, ladies and gentlemen, there he is.
[30.54s -> 41.16s]  Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. No. No. Hello. All right. Well, let's mute this.
[41.16s -> 47.08s]  Let's mute them so I can do my intro. That was very loud. Did you just drive by? Was that you?
[47.64s -> 53.93s]  That was me. All right. Give me a sec. Give me a sec. Gone. But yeah, we're going to play some
[53.93s -> 59.58s]  motor area. We're just to pick up right where we left off last week. Continuing the training
[59.58s -> 64.41s]  session. Oh, I didn't mute on his side. Sorry, dude.
[74.46s -> 79.78s]  All right. Oh, you can, you guys didn't hear what he just said. So I'm like on both ends,
[80.58s -> 84.90s]  you, I'm talking to you and they don't hear you. And then I was talking to them and you don't hear,
[84.90s -> 87.54s]  you know what I mean? Like I just ruined that whole thing. Is this your first time?
[87.54s -> 95.70s]  Um, first time streaming 375th or something like that. I think. Okay. Well, um,
[96.74s -> 99.72s]  you'll get better. All right. We don't even need an intro. We're already here.
[100.28s -> 105.24s]  So we're starting late. So let's go. Those of you that don't know what Terraria is. Um, it's a base
[105.24s -> 112.92s]  building block exploration game where I know and that let's go. It's 2D Minecraft. Your guys ever
[112.92s -> 121.46s]  played Minecraft? When's the Minecraft stream German? I already did it. Did you? Yeah. Dude,
[121.46s -> 126.26s]  you're a trending gamer. You know, I did. I've played Minecraft like six times in the last,
[126.26s -> 135.61s]  like three years. I think you need a new playthrough. I will never do a playthrough of
[135.61s -> 142.90s]  Minecraft again. I might open it and like fall down into lava once or twice for like a couple
[142.90s -> 148.54s]  hours and build a dirt house, but I'm not going to do like a full play through it. You know,
[148.54s -> 152.14s]  it would take a million dollars to beat the ender dragon. I mean, it would take,
[152.14s -> 162.73s]  if you have a million dollars, I'll do it. Wow. Wow. Okay. So play Terraria. He wants a million.
[163.37s -> 171.64s]  Okay. Why do you think a man now? I got a nice fat check for Mr. Stir. Hey, I'm going to invite you
[172.20s -> 176.44s]  to the squad stream. Cause my chat's telling me to do it. How did you start streaming?
[177.51s -> 181.11s]  It's yeah, it's been on. Don't let this be like last time where you didn't think I was streaming
[181.11s -> 187.19s]  for like four hours. No, I knew you, I knew you were streaming. I mean, you're just like,
[188.47s -> 198.31s]  want to squad up apparently. That's what they want. So where we last left off, hey,
[198.31s -> 203.43s]  we're not in hard mode yet. We haven't killed the wall. We were in the dungeon and um,
[204.39s -> 209.67s]  but we want to do before we kill the wall. And the last thing we were going to do is get you that
[209.67s -> 216.87s]  sick new summoner armor step. That's right. Do that. We need to go get some water candles from
[216.87s -> 224.87s]  the dungeon. Hey, drama left the game. No, I didn't. It said you left. So we can do this rejoin,
[225.35s -> 235.19s]  uh, thing for like another 20 minutes. Hey, sweet. Everybody watching you all missed it,
[235.19s -> 239.03s]  but you know how we rejoined and tried to join each other and talked about how dog
[239.03s -> 248.81s]  shit steam is for like 20 minutes so we can do it all again. All right. Pretty good. Pretty good
[248.81s -> 259.14s]  stuff. All right. Um, hold on. So you want to try this, uh, because again, yeah. Oh yeah. I
[259.14s -> 269.27s]  have to invite you. Hello. Who do I watch? Germa or story? You can see both with the squad stream.
[269.91s -> 275.99s]  Hello. Okay. You're gonna invite. I did this did this last time though. Do you remember this did
[275.99s -> 282.63s]  this last time it did. And then it was fine. But like you need to be able to rejoin. I hopefully
[282.63s -> 286.31s]  again and I can, I'm here. So let's hope that that looks, it's just like there's what happens
[286.31s -> 290.79s]  when you play terraria. Yeah. Okay. It's, it's the first time, first time jitters. The game was
[290.79s -> 298.17s]  nervous. All right. You ready? I'm ready. Uh, here there's one. Okay. Okay. Okay. Before we go,
[298.17s -> 304.09s]  while it's nighttime, we're going to end up needing demonite bars. So we're going to have
[304.09s -> 311.05s]  to kill a boss that drops demonite bars. Demonite bars. Yeah. I think we can just kill the eye.
[312.82s -> 318.74s]  No, how many bars do we need? Uh, a bit. I think we might have to kill it twice and then we can
[318.74s -> 324.14s]  walk to the dungeon. Where's it going? And you can remember how to play. I know, I know how to play.
[325.62s -> 329.46s]  Well, you wanted the refresher. You know, this is just like, Hey, reminder, everyone
[329.46s -> 335.62s]  welcome back. We're the guys. I'm melting him right now. I'm melting him right now.
[336.26s -> 351.53s]  I'm hit. I took a hit. I took a few hits. I took like six hits. All right, we're good.
[352.47s -> 359.35s]  Okay. We're good. How many bars? Uh, it gives it or so. I don't know. Why is it two? I made another
[359.35s -> 364.36s]  one. We're going to need another one because I, I used all of our demonite bars to make
[365.64s -> 373.54s]  storage. You get hit. I got hit. He's killing our guy. Why can he go in there? There's a wall.
[374.95s -> 382.09s]  He doesn't give a shit. Oh, good job. Now he dropped all of his things in there and then
[382.09s -> 390.78s]  mine and you can have them. That's a dated reference. What did I do for a dated reference?
[390.78s -> 401.38s]  What did I do? What did I say? I don't know. Uh, but that's probably enough. Do you have enough
[401.38s -> 413.62s]  bars? Uh, we will, but we have to go to the dungeon and get a water candle. You said can I
[413.62s -> 421.46s]  has cheeseburger. I did not say that. Take this, take, take, take, take, take that. Don't like deep
[421.46s -> 427.85s]  fake thought that shit on me. All right. I got it. And that's a charm. So don't call him Jay.
[427.85s -> 433.61s]  That's my mom's name. What? Oh, that's true. Actually he's Jay nine to five. All right. What
[433.61s -> 439.29s]  is this a spirit? This is the, uh, the one with the minions, right? Yeah. But what don't I have
[439.29s -> 443.37s]  like a double jump right now? And don't I need that because of my training wheels? Your own
[443.37s -> 449.05s]  training wheels. Yes. Uh, so when we come back, I'll make you the full set and then you'll wear
[449.05s -> 453.05s]  the full set. Oh, like for now double jumps. Right. Pretty good. Double jump is important
[453.05s -> 458.25s]  for somebody that's on training bills. Oh dude, he's selling a kimono. Oh, I thought that was a B.
[459.13s -> 461.93s]  What does he got? He's selling a kimono.
[464.97s -> 474.39s]  You could just call me Jeremy, you know. You're right. Okay. I'm going to store some things and
[474.39s -> 481.14s]  we're going. You sure? Yeah. I have three bananas. What do you do with these?
[483.22s -> 493.56s]  You can have them. I hate you. Oh, I see. I think I killed somebody. Oops. That's just,
[493.56s -> 498.76s]  that's how it is. What is this? Did we, did we make this? Who made this? Yeah, that's my,
[498.76s -> 505.45s]  I don't want to tell you what that is. Let's go. All right. I'm going. So do you eventually get like
[505.45s -> 511.93s]  speed increases like times two speed or extra speed or you get boots that let you sprint,
[511.93s -> 517.29s]  you get wings that let you fly and move faster. You can also, right now you should have the hook,
[517.29s -> 523.77s]  right? And give you a hook. If you hook the ground, it'll like pull you towards it faster than
[523.77s -> 533.82s]  your move speed. That's really cool. You technically could lay down wire all the way across the map to
[533.82s -> 541.77s]  build a teleporter or you can make like mine cart tracks. Wait, wait, am I going the right way?
[541.77s -> 552.10s]  We're not even the same party. You're going the right way. Okay. Did I miss anything? No.
[553.06s -> 564.01s]  This is our first time playing together in four years. I didn't think he would talk to me again,
[564.01s -> 576.84s]  but here we are. Why did you think that? You know, the money. Oh, right. The money handle
[577.56s -> 581.64s]  the money. It was, you didn't say you've already forgotten about the money.
[582.52s -> 590.28s]  I never forget. I never forget about the money. Oh, I remember I did that.
[591.08s -> 601.29s]  Is it one? What happened? No, none. You left again. No, I mean that Mike, that was like a full on,
[601.29s -> 607.70s]  like the game hard crashed. That wasn't a disconnect. Terraria like hard crashed.
[608.78s -> 617.96s]  I don't even have it open anymore. That's good news. I just want to play. What the fuck?
[619.06s -> 623.94s]  I mean, I played with Ashley for like two days straight, maybe three. She never,
[623.94s -> 628.50s]  she never crashed. Why am I crashing now? Are you sure that we don't have to like update mods or
[628.50s -> 639.11s]  something? Yes. You're sure? I'm sure. Okay. I mean, I'll just, I'll just run the errand by myself.
[639.67s -> 646.14s]  Just wait. I'm almost here. It's really like we just have to like grab a candle. It doesn't matter.
[646.14s -> 662.52s]  Okay. Can't run a sprite based game. I mean, it's tough. Yeah. See, I got like everything all set,
[662.52s -> 668.90s]  right? What the fuck was up with that? That's weird. Yeah. That was like a, like,
[670.26s -> 673.46s]  like I didn't, I couldn't move. I couldn't do, like the game just exited.
[676.54s -> 683.11s]  Maybe it's, maybe it's me. Is it you, you think? And maybe, no, it's a, I'm the problem,
[689.16s -> 693.03s]  you know? All right. I'll be ready. Whenever you're ready, I'll be ready.
[693.83s -> 700.02s]  Oh yeah. I'm just, I'm just running an errand. So I can't, you have to invite me. I can't just
[700.02s -> 708.18s]  join off you. I did invite you. You did invite me. I don't see it. Invite friends. Oh, there it is.
[708.18s -> 716.94s]  Got it. Okay. He had it already. All right. Joining stir. He had it already. Hopefully my fucking game
[716.94s -> 733.75s]  doesn't crash. Uh, he had it already. All right. Hey, let's do like strike three. I think last week
[733.75s -> 739.16s]  someone was saying, well, that wouldn't be a problem either. I'm going to ignore what that
[739.16s -> 743.80s]  guy said and forget what that guy said. I'm going to repeat it. It's disgusting. Don't tell him.
[743.80s -> 751.26s]  He won't know it's me. Yeah. Hello. Um, no, but like what, what, what's, what's the problem?
[752.25s -> 770.17s]  I don't know. I don't know, dude. Pepe face. Yeah. I'm going to go find me and you like backup plan.
[770.17s -> 782.65s]  You can always just play games made 40 years ago. It's fun to do that though. Yeah. Did you get
[782.65s -> 788.34s]  the item? What did you get the item? Um, yeah, I'm just grabbing a few more while I'm here.
[788.98s -> 798.26s]  I'm being productive and I want to come back here. That's like the sec. That's like the third loud
[798.26s -> 804.68s]  fucking driver. It is. We're getting a lot. And that's what happens when you live in Manhattan.
[810.31s -> 818.66s]  Are you next to a highway or is it just like, it's just Vegas, Vegas, baby.
[822.34s -> 829.54s]  DOS is 40 years old. Is it real? What? I had no health. What? I dropped 47 gold.
[834.62s -> 843.54s]  I'm doing a great job. Um, I should go back there. I'm doing a great job. I'm,
[843.54s -> 853.58s]  I'm just like a fucking animal in your server. Where are you? What do you like to know? Oh,
[853.58s -> 860.47s]  you're hanging out on the giant thing. Uh, I want to participate. I don't want to just be
[860.47s -> 864.63s]  like a squirrel in your game. I got you the things. I got you the things. Did you, you need to get,
[864.63s -> 871.00s]  you dropped 50 bucks down there. We'll go get it. Hold on. Hold on. I want to be a
[871.00s -> 880.92s]  Warcraft critter in your fucking server. Just come here to the, come to the forge. My darling,
[880.92s -> 886.65s]  my darling. Why do I have a triple jump? Did I get that with being by being a squirrel?
[886.65s -> 893.98s]  You might have a cloud in a bottle. Oh yeah. Okay. So here's, here's the boots. Where are you
[894.71s -> 901.67s]  darling? I'm the squirrel in the room. Oh, you're the, okay. And here's my hat. So you put all those
[901.67s -> 908.15s]  on, you get an extra bonus. You'll be able to summon like 30 guys. Nice. Okay. I don't know
[908.15s -> 914.63s]  what the bonus is. Six defense over these three movement speed throwing damage. That's not bad.
[914.63s -> 924.74s]  All right. Let's put them on. So I can have max minions. Cool. All right. I'm gonna go get my 47
[924.74s -> 933.11s]  gold on table. So I can have two extra sons. Killing enemies or continually damaging bosses
[933.11s -> 939.16s]  generates soul wisps. After generating five wisps, they are instantly consumed to heal
[939.16s -> 946.63s]  you for 10 health. That's actually pretty great. That's really cool. All right. Nice. Let me go.
[946.63s -> 952.63s]  How many can I have? You said, let's see. I remember to touch the table. How do I, it's not
[952.63s -> 959.74s]  sons, it's summons. So your, your bird, I don't remember what you had the dank creeper perhaps.
[960.38s -> 971.66s]  How do I stop being squirrel? Okay. Thank you. All right. So let's see. No, this doesn't count as a
[971.66s -> 981.19s]  summon. No, that is a century. Oh, the boys that follow you. Damn it. Okay. What about these? Are
[981.19s -> 986.50s]  these some? All right. There we go. No, nevermind. You don't have two of those. That's just century
[986.50s -> 995.00s]  two. I'm century guy, not summon guy. Right? No. What are you doing? The clouds, dude, I'm going to
[995.00s -> 1004.07s]  have to tell you something right now. I threw away the other ones. I don't think I have those
[1004.07s -> 1013.88s]  anymore. No, no, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait. They're in here. He's being quiet. He's very
[1013.88s -> 1018.68s]  upset. Hold on. There we go. I'm thinking like, do I run back to town? Do I run back to our base and
[1018.68s -> 1027.16s]  hit him or do I get the gold? All right. So that's shadow drop staff is one of them. And then you can
[1027.16s -> 1031.72s]  only have one type of summon out at any point anyways, right? You can have more than one type.
[1032.60s -> 1036.76s]  Okay. So you, your, your pants, your armor and your helmet give a summon and you have one by
[1036.76s -> 1042.09s]  default. So you should be able to have four summons. Okay. Cool. And then you touch the
[1042.09s -> 1049.99s]  bewitching table and you get five. All right. So I definitely, um, I definitely threw away
[1049.99s -> 1056.94s]  some as a dog, dank creeper. Okay. Hold on. That's the good one. Oh, summons a dark or a rain from
[1056.94s -> 1063.96s]  the sky. No, no, no. That's not that fire is a story. Okay. That's the creeper. That's the one.
[1063.96s -> 1078.84s]  All right. Proud of you. All right. So let me go check it out. Let's see what it does.
[1078.84s -> 1082.20s]  It's like I can have three. Okay. That's pretty ridiculous. I can have three of these out at the
[1082.20s -> 1091.13s]  same time. Why am I so slow? It should give you five, five. It's not giving me five. It's three,
[1091.93s -> 1102.58s]  four with the table. Right. How do I activate it? Right. Click the table. Unless I just didn't read
[1102.58s -> 1108.42s]  the helmet. No, you didn't read it right. It's four with the table. Okay. All right. I'm ready to be
[1108.42s -> 1115.11s]  guy that just walks around and lets other things do everything for him. Um, well, wait, the owl
[1115.11s -> 1120.63s]  might be taking a summon slot. How do I, how do I get the owl to leap? The owl shouldn't be doing
[1120.63s -> 1125.99s]  that. It's a pet, which no, no, no, it's a highly doubt it. It's, it, the helmet is, uh, in its
[1125.99s -> 1131.91s]  helmets, minion damage, not summon minion. Okay. The two other pieces are extra minion. The helm
[1131.91s -> 1139.46s]  is 10% more damage. All right. So what are you, what are you at? Um, I'm grabbing the 47 gold that
[1139.54s -> 1152.58s]  I dropped. I'm going to go do that. I'm not paying attention chat. So as I was saying the last time,
[1152.58s -> 1155.78s]  last time we were playing, you were talking about how you wanted to like know more about
[1155.78s -> 1163.67s]  what you're doing. You said you're going to do some reading. Did you do any reading? Um,
[1165.94s -> 1175.34s]  so what would you like to do? I haven't had time. I haven't had time. All right. I would like to do
[1175.34s -> 1183.94s]  a boss. Okay. Here's, here's a couple of things that can be done. Um, you can actually change
[1183.94s -> 1189.14s]  the server to expert mode and bosses drop more things on expert mode that you can only get in
[1189.14s -> 1196.81s]  expert mode. And then we can kill bosses. We've already done. Um, I think there's two more bosses
[1196.81s -> 1201.21s]  for the mods that we can do. I have to double check which ones they are. I forget what we haven't
[1201.21s -> 1209.69s]  done. And we can do the wall of flesh, which is a big deal because after that, the game goes into
[1209.69s -> 1222.34s]  hard mode. Oh, okay. My guys can't get in here. I'm just kind of doing a little bit of exploring.
[1222.42s -> 1227.46s]  Okay. So none of those options. No, I just going to do a lot. All right. You pretty much just spoke
[1227.46s -> 1232.74s]  a different language for 30 straight seconds. Um, whatever you want to do, whatever you,
[1232.74s -> 1236.34s]  whatever you think would be the most interesting and more like most fun. You were talking about
[1236.34s -> 1239.38s]  like how you wanted to read up. You wanted to go in order. You wanted to make sure you weren't
[1239.38s -> 1245.13s]  doing anything and understand what we were doing. No, I know, I know what we're doing. What are we
[1245.13s -> 1249.53s]  doing? We're doing the wall of flesh. It's hard mode. It's like Diablo. You get, you, you, you
[1249.53s -> 1252.65s]  level up to a different, different quality. There's a couple of bosses before the wall of flesh that
[1252.65s -> 1255.61s]  we'll technically skip. If we do the wall of flesh, we can come back and do them later,
[1255.61s -> 1258.41s]  but we're probably never going to do that. So do you want to do those before we do the wall
[1258.41s -> 1264.73s]  of flesh? Sure. That sounds like fun. Okay. I need a second to check what we haven't done.
[1264.73s -> 1284.52s]  We didn't do the star scouter and we did not do slime. God slime. God is that what's the slime
[1284.52s -> 1290.47s]  God? Oh, because we never found the meteorite. I think we have to walk left and find the meteorite
[1290.47s -> 1298.41s]  and then we can do the star color thingy. Okay. Um, slime God is, it's just two big slimes at once,
[1298.41s -> 1306.95s]  but it drops some, some good stuff. Exploring caves is a lot more fun than just, uh, and more
[1306.95s -> 1317.90s]  productive than digging. Oh, okay. So, um, you don't think shaming you? No, they're saying that
[1317.90s -> 1321.90s]  don't like dig, go find a cave. Digging is like not productive to go like find stuff.
[1324.30s -> 1328.06s]  But what if you want it to dig? I thought you wanted to dig. You must have wanted to dig.
[1328.06s -> 1332.46s]  I don't know, but I'm putting a lot of torches down because I'm holding the shift.
[1333.42s -> 1337.50s]  That's because I'm holding shift to like do the thing where you can just automatically change to
[1337.50s -> 1353.82s]  what the hell was that? Give me these back. All right. There's a present out here. I love presents.
[1353.82s -> 1360.90s]  Okay. Uh, so we need to go, we need to go left. Yeah. I'm at the meteor. I'm mining meteorite
[1360.90s -> 1364.34s]  right now. That's what I'm doing. I'm just coming over here. You're at the meteor now.
[1365.22s -> 1370.41s]  Yeah. Let me touch, let me touch the thing. Oh, I got the little globes around me. I'm gonna get
[1370.41s -> 1383.75s]  so confused. Can you buy? Yes. Dynamite before you come here. How much do you want? I don't know.
[1384.78s -> 1396.46s]  Like 20. Why don't you just open the present then? All right. You want 20 dynamite. Yeah.
[1403.99s -> 1406.95s]  There might even be some in the box. How does one sound?
[1409.35s -> 1415.26s]  How do I only have enough money for one? You can search in the box and see if there's gold.
[1415.26s -> 1419.82s]  Search for gold. Search for dynamite. Search for bombs. Bombs would be good enough.
[1420.54s -> 1428.10s]  Okay. There's no dynamite in here. Bomb. No bombs in here. No, I'm an idiot. I don't want
[1428.10s -> 1436.89s]  to filter weapons. Filter all. No dynamite. There are bombs in here though. I'm gonna buy
[1436.89s -> 1450.15s]  whatever I can buy with this. You wanted, guys, what's happening right now? 20 silver. Why can
[1450.15s -> 1458.28s]  it? Okay. All right. I got 11 dynamite and 12 bombs. Okay. You're going to want to,
[1458.28s -> 1463.24s]  you're going to want to come to me now. I'm on the way. And then you can participate. Good.
[1470.87s -> 1480.07s]  I love these things. This is so cool. Uh, where exactly did you, why'd you dig over here?
[1484.63s -> 1488.63s]  What? Stop asking me dumb questions. What's, what's, what's, what did you do over here?
[1492.36s -> 1497.16s]  Did we do this? I don't remember doing this. I can't see you. We're squad streaming. You can
[1497.16s -> 1501.32s]  see what I'm doing. You can just look at the squad window. That's why chat was telling you
[1501.32s -> 1513.27s]  it's not productive because like that's natural. It's just a hole. They exist. Uh, do you, do you,
[1513.27s -> 1516.23s]  how are you doing on Nana? You need like Nana stones? Whatever the hell these things are.
[1517.27s -> 1525.34s]  Uh, I think I still need like a few. Cause I have three. Wow. Someone's been holding out.
[1526.06s -> 1533.54s]  I like my little flare gun though. Like makes me able to see what I'm doing.
[1533.54s -> 1546.02s]  All right, buddy, boy. All right, let's go. This is meteor. This is the meteor. You don't
[1546.02s -> 1549.86s]  stand on the meteor because it burns you if you stand on it. Okay. So that's why you're going
[1549.86s -> 1554.50s]  to mine. So you just chuck some bombs down there. You want me just to start, just start throwing
[1554.50s -> 1558.74s]  dynamite down there and just throw a dynamite, you know, throw some bombs. The goal is to get
[1558.74s -> 1565.06s]  the meteorite as dynamite stands up in this game or does it fly? Okay. Some, some games dynamite
[1565.06s -> 1576.23s]  stands right up. Wait. Ow. What do you mean it stands up? They just don't like flat. Oh,
[1576.23s -> 1580.55s]  like you placed it on the ground. Yeah. I know. I thought you were insane, but I get it. How far,
[1580.55s -> 1586.31s]  how far down does this go? Uh, stop. You see like the brown rocks that are flaming. All right.
[1586.31s -> 1590.84s]  That's the meteor. I'm going to get it in there. See if I can get it in one. This is kind of like
[1590.84s -> 1598.31s]  a pinball game. Well, you see like you could just drop it over here now. Oops. I'm fine.
[1598.31s -> 1602.31s]  I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. All right. Watch out.
[1606.60s -> 1614.01s]  What's a blast rate? I just told you I was throwing one. This is a lot. So what do you,
[1614.01s -> 1621.42s]  do you like crap bars with? Yeah, we don't, we don't really need much more. How do we get it?
[1621.42s -> 1626.14s]  Also, we need to be, we need meteorite to summon the boss. Oh, okay. That we were going to do.
[1626.14s -> 1635.29s]  Do you want more than that? Or is that nothing? This will be enough. Why is that shooting at you?
[1637.51s -> 1646.47s]  I don't know. I think it's on drugs. Might be. Okay. So yeah, that's 300 meteorite. We're good.
[1646.47s -> 1658.86s]  We're good. Go back. Go back. What do I have? Let me look at my stuff. Sticky bomb. That's cool.
[1659.82s -> 1666.89s]  Sticky dynamite. It's combining dynamite with gel. So when you throw those things, that's cool.
[1667.53s -> 1680.62s]  All right. I got a goodie bag. Also, I can wait. That hook. Oh, here. Take these. These won't break
[1680.62s -> 1692.17s]  if I throw them to you, right? The stars. All right. Oh, muscle talk. Do you want this ancient
[1692.17s -> 1696.01s]  shiv? 35 melee damage, 4% crit, very fast attack speed, average knockback material,
[1696.01s -> 1703.45s]  enemies release a blue aura cloud on death. No. Sell it. Sell it. Sell it. Who has the most money
[1703.45s -> 1713.83s]  in here? They all, they all just give you money. They don't have like a bank. Too much, too much
[1713.83s -> 1721.74s]  like fallout. All right. So on the left side for me is like default characters. I know pretty
[1721.74s -> 1726.38s]  much what all these do. You added like two expansions to this game and I don't know what
[1726.38s -> 1736.86s]  any of this is. Here's the important ones. Faye, the dryad, sells boss summon items generally for
[1736.86s -> 1745.50s]  bosses you've already beaten. Okay. So she helps. Cool. Paul. Paul's nobody. All right. Well, let's
[1745.50s -> 1749.02s]  summon them. And he doesn't have the things I was looking for. So you want to summon the boss?
[1756.15s -> 1766.01s]  Oh, this guy's boss is summons as well. We have to go up to the sky box. Like we can only summon
[1766.01s -> 1776.90s]  this boss up in the. Really? The tops. Yeah. I actually don't know how hard this boss is or what
[1776.90s -> 1790.89s]  it does. Oh, that's good to know. We're prepared. I know that we need platforms. We're going to need
[1790.89s -> 1794.41s]  to build platforms so we can actually move. Do you have enough wood for that or do we need to go get
[1794.41s -> 1804.49s]  it? I think it's in the box. All right. Well, I'll be up here. Okay. Hope you're having a good time.
[1804.49s -> 1810.06s]  Hope you're having a good day. I'm having a good day. I hope you had a really good drink.
[1810.86s -> 1817.18s]  A good drink. Yeah. Well, just like treat it yourself with a beverage. You know what I'm talking
[1817.18s -> 1822.58s]  about? Who's this person? Why is there like a lady up here? She had a lot of health.
[1823.30s -> 1843.42s]  Hag? Where the hell am I? Yes. You coming? Oh, it's because the gravity changed. Okay. That's cool.
[1851.56s -> 1856.68s]  My health. What's wrong with my health? Jerma hasn't activated squad stream. Oh, that's my bad.
[1856.68s -> 1863.08s]  I accepted the invite. Okay. I activated it. It's live now. Oh no, I did it. Yeah. Yeah. I'm
[1863.08s -> 1869.13s]  saying it's my fault. Did you not hear me? Dude, you got like such a cover because no matter what
[1869.13s -> 1873.77s]  happens, if something wrong goes, if something goes wrong, it's you could always be like, well,
[1873.77s -> 1880.09s]  Jerma is a stupid idiot. You have, you have like such insurance when you like do anything with me,
[1880.09s -> 1884.17s]  it seems. And you know, if I wouldn't have that, if you had a little bit more confidence,
[1885.69s -> 1892.02s]  a little bit of self-respect and you can be like, no, you can literally throw a baseball through
[1892.02s -> 1898.58s]  your window right now. And it would just be like, Jerma, you fucking left the thing over here. You
[1898.58s -> 1902.58s]  left the window unlocked and you were cleaning the window and it dropped and people would believe
[1902.58s -> 1914.82s]  you. And it'd be like, what did I do? I didn't do anything. True. I said, how big does this
[1914.82s -> 1920.28s]  platform have to be? I'm just doing it. One, one, one, just protect me. Summon your sentry thing.
[1920.28s -> 1927.08s]  They're everywhere. No, you're fucking auto shoot sun. Oh, you mean this thing? Yeah. Don't forget
[1927.08s -> 1944.12s]  you have a sun. See, this is all your fucking fault. Oh, fuck man. Like I brought my car in to get
[1944.12s -> 1951.42s]  repaired and I need a, I need like a new gasket. Jerma, like what the fuck, man? Like you should
[1951.42s -> 1958.49s]  have been in the server faster. What happened? I, I stupid man. Usually I just blame Ronnie.
[1958.49s -> 1965.37s]  This guy is so like oblivious and selfish that he made me buy like seven different cables to
[1965.37s -> 1970.17s]  fix a computer problem. Like I trusted him and he took advantage of me and I ended up buying like
[1970.17s -> 1979.66s]  seven cables. Wait, what? Okay. I'm summoning a boss. All right. Where are you going to summon it?
[1980.62s -> 1990.52s]  And where I am, you just summon it and then it comes to you. I'm getting my ass kicked. I'm worried.
[1990.52s -> 2008.36s]  Do I? This shit shooting us from underneath. Whoa. Okay. I don't know what it does.
[2011.32s -> 2015.53s]  What are you doing? What's this? How do I do this? Oh my God. Okay. You're going to jump over that
[2015.53s -> 2023.34s]  apparently. Why is he focusing on me? You know, like honestly, you're probably dealing so much
[2023.34s -> 2032.60s]  more damage than me. Oh, I'm speaking of dying. If you're, you can use your mirror, go back to town.
[2038.74s -> 2047.19s]  I picked up my stupid pickaxe. Where the, oh my God. Where the fuck is our healer? Do we,
[2047.19s -> 2061.82s]  oh, she's right there. How do I, how do I respawn? Oh, that didn't go so well. Is it, is he dead?
[2063.06s -> 2076.58s]  He might've left. No, wait. Hold on. Oh, respawn time. What's your max health? 160. Yeah. We're
[2076.58s -> 2090.09s]  pretty low. We should be a lot higher right now. How much higher do we need to be? Uh, we could be
[2090.09s -> 2100.04s]  at 300. Oh, that sounds pretty important. Yeah, it does. Should I wait for you? It still shows
[2100.04s -> 2111.16s]  his health bar. So I don't. Is he just hanging out up here? He shouldn't be. Yeah. I don't know.
[2111.16s -> 2124.58s]  Let's go find, uh, health. How about that? Is that? No. Uh. Why, why, what's with the,
[2124.58s -> 2134.15s]  what's the, why this topaz? Give me that. Uh. So are we just gonna go get health? Yeah. Hold on.
[2134.15s -> 2138.89s]  Why is everybody vote kicking me? Didn't you hear what Star said? I was the one doing the damage.
[2139.45s -> 2147.24s]  Who's the birthday person? Is this, I'm just breaking this guy's house and taking his stuff.
[2147.88s -> 2178.14s]  He doesn't care. What happened? Star. Star. It's boss.
[2185.80s -> 2188.92s]  Oh no, he's by chest hurts right now. Seriously. What the fuck?
[2191.45s -> 2221.40s]  I'm just going to. Tyler doesn't give a shit. I don't know what I did, but he's raining fire
[2221.40s -> 2232.09s]  down. Oh shit. It's the fucking prophecy. He's not going to kill him. He's going to kill everybody.
[2233.75s -> 2241.43s]  He just goes killed. No man. Why are you not reacting to this? I feel like you would be
[2241.43s -> 2248.81s]  fucking freaking out right now. Are we in the same game? Am I muted? Yes. You've been muted.
[2248.81s -> 2256.68s]  I think I was muted. Oh yeah. I, whoops. All right. Calvin has one sliver of health. He's
[2256.68s -> 2262.74s]  going to die. Yeah. I was trying to give some advice and some tips and some, some technique.
[2262.74s -> 2266.90s]  Maybe. What happened? He, I just was, I was breaking some into somebody's house and he
[2266.90s -> 2274.70s]  just spawned on me. Well, let's, that's what's weird is he still has a health bar. All right.
[2274.70s -> 2283.75s]  So he's, he's somewhere. All right. Let's go find him. He's just like appears. This is so scary.
[2283.75s -> 2292.39s]  It's like, um, I feel like it's fucking Mr. X by the way, did you play the new resident evil
[2292.39s -> 2297.70s]  two remake? Uh, I watched a lot of it and played it. That's probably one of the best games of the
[2297.78s -> 2312.97s]  year. Oh shit. You mean it's one of the best games of 10 years ago? Well, yeah. Because
[2312.97s -> 2318.49s]  Capcom hit a hard spot and couldn't, couldn't make new games anymore. So the new strat is just to
[2318.49s -> 2342.74s]  make old stuff again. He's on me. I'm dead. I was going to teleport and I didn't. I'm, I'm,
[2342.74s -> 2348.86s]  I'm a ghetto. He's just juggling me right now. I'm dead. Why don't you just kill it,
[2348.86s -> 2353.82s]  Jerma? Come on. Fuck dude. You're the strong one. I'm the one doing the armor. You got the
[2353.82s -> 2358.62s]  summons. You have the sentry. You have all the good stuff. You take all the fucking good gear.
[2358.62s -> 2364.09s]  He just juggled me. He just juggled me. He did. He just juggled me in the air. We're not, hey,
[2364.09s -> 2370.57s]  don't even give me this kind of shit. You've got like a guy on training wheels here and where like
[2370.57s -> 2376.57s]  a hundred percent less health than we would need to be. And you just, you, all right. Yeah. I don't
[2376.57s -> 2381.85s]  know. You just put me in armor. You have better attack damage because you have all the summons.
[2383.16s -> 2389.72s]  I've given you everything. You can't, all right. You can't put like a toddler in fucking like gold
[2389.72s -> 2399.27s]  armor, give him a sword and say, all right, I gave you all this really cool stuff. You're like,
[2399.27s -> 2403.59s]  really? Look at how you look at how shiny that armor is. Why have you not killed the other king
[2403.59s -> 2418.41s]  yet? What? But can't you? Toddler screaming. Yeah. In the game, in the game. I still am like,
[2418.41s -> 2424.57s]  just like a baby in this game. Okay. Well, the boss is somewhere with like 7% health. Just say
[2424.57s -> 2436.23s]  sliver. It's like a cooler, like more like cooler vocabulary. He's, he's one. He's one. He's lit.
[2436.23s -> 2447.98s]  Where is he? Is he right there? Is that him? What is that? I'm afraid to do anything right now.
[2448.62s -> 2469.26s]  No, it's gold. Only it shows bosses on the map, but he's not. What if he was like all the way over
[2469.26s -> 2478.68s]  here? I don't, I don't see him. All right. Can I go back and like open the chest that I was going
[2478.68s -> 2485.29s]  to open at this guy's house? All right. It's already open. There's like nothing in it. So yeah, go,
[2485.29s -> 2493.67s]  go ahead and do your stupid thing. Does he leave when there's a party going on? No, maybe he doesn't
[2493.67s -> 2503.43s]  know. Okay. He's by me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me. He hates me. Uh, don't die. Don't die.
[2503.43s -> 2511.86s]  Give me like two seconds. I'm trying. Tell me if you're going to die. Oh, it's going to be close.
[2512.66s -> 2524.28s]  Oh, it's going to be close. He's dead. Okay. What'd you get? Uh, I got broken star trail healing
[2524.28s -> 2541.05s]  potion and broken star trail. It's a weapon, a snake banner, vanquisher metal. That's nothing.
[2541.85s -> 2561.74s]  It's broken. So that means it's bad. It's terrible stats. Let me see. Where are you? Here. What was
[2561.74s -> 2571.78s]  that? I don't know. What's going on? Oh, I want to see. I want to see. Uh, yes, I drew it. What else did
[2571.78s -> 2584.98s]  he drop? Something else too. Where is it? Oh, dude. Graviton surge. Oh, quick sort. Sort of. Yeah,
[2584.98s -> 2593.14s]  there we go. Okay. Okay. Well, that was intense. There's a guy that resets the stats on an item.
[2593.14s -> 2598.74s]  I don't know if we ever got them. That was fun. It was apparently we don't have enough houses.
[2599.46s -> 2604.84s]  Can I, um, my hand's up in the back. I'm like raising my hand up. Yeah. And you call. Okay.
[2604.84s -> 2609.80s]  Thank you. Uh, can we get more health so we don't have to, uh, like be, uh, nerfed the whole time
[2609.80s -> 2620.95s]  we played again? Um, I would, I would like that. Yeah. Who the fuck is this guy? We just have to
[2620.95s -> 2627.53s]  go explore to find the health, right? Yeah. Random parts under the ground. Random parts on the ground.
[2627.53s -> 2633.13s]  You got it. I'm going. Uh, if you take our giant tunnel and go down and then go to the right,
[2633.13s -> 2639.05s]  because I don't think we explored the right. What? Oh my God. I thought I had an extra, like,
[2639.05s -> 2642.89s]  I was going to jump. I was going to do the double jump, but like his platform was here.
[2642.89s -> 2653.30s]  I didn't know. I was going to just wait till, you know, jump before you hit the ground. I didn't
[2653.30s -> 2661.58s]  know. I, your platform just killed me. Oh, good joke. He wasn't a joke. In fact, destroyed fucking
[2661.58s -> 2671.59s]  evidence. Oh, uh, good joke. Okay. Let me, I gotta store some shit before we do anything.
[2671.59s -> 2683.59s]  Oh, the Calvin's respawning health. Nice. All right. Let me deposit this stuff.
[2685.29s -> 2693.90s]  Okay. Okay. Now what do I want with me? Oh, definitely like 7,000 torches. Hey,
[2693.90s -> 2708.17s]  where the fuck did the guy go? Did they leave? Did they get invaded yet? Spoilers. I don't want
[2708.17s -> 2719.02s]  to see spoilers. That can't even happen. We're in normal mode. Can't even happen. We're in normal.
[2719.02s -> 2724.46s]  Wait, like eight more hours of us playing together. That's actually our first blood moon.
[2724.46s -> 2730.89s]  What do you mean? What are we talking about? What? What does the blood moon do? What's that mean?
[2731.93s -> 2739.24s]  It means they're going to start attacking. Did I just say we haven't been invaded yet? And then
[2740.36s -> 2747.00s]  did I do that? Well, no, being invaded is like dark souls. Oh, that's where like 16 players show
[2747.00s -> 2754.41s]  up in your game and gank you. Is that really what happens? No, there is an alien invasion.
[2755.54s -> 2762.34s]  I assume is what they meant. Okay. So do we do this to defend the house?
[2764.09s -> 2768.73s]  Yeah, if you want to. We, they drop a special item, blood droplets, and we need a few of them
[2768.73s -> 2782.62s]  because we've never had a blood moon before, as far as I remember. Honestly, if you just stay in
[2782.62s -> 2786.86s]  the house, they all come to the door and your summons stay outside and they'll probably kill
[2786.86s -> 2802.78s]  everything. Oh, cool. The door. Ah, the door. They are coming. All right. I got left side,
[2802.78s -> 2816.87s]  you get right side. Oh, this makes you feel like a necromancer. I thought that was you. Wow.
[2818.31s -> 2823.34s]  Who's got the glasses? So yeah, like, yeah, we still don't have the freaking,
[2823.34s -> 2828.70s]  the guy that like we are missing so many NPCs. I do not want to build houses for another hour.
[2828.70s -> 2837.02s]  Or like we should go to hell and just make a whole bunch of rooms for all these idiots.
[2838.58s -> 2850.98s]  We're going to put these people in hell. That sounds kind of mean. Now go on collection. All
[2850.98s -> 2861.77s]  right. What or I'm going to go up the dreaded patchwork patchwork. There's a mini boss on my
[2861.77s -> 2866.89s]  side. Oh, honestly, the blood moon. This should have happened to us like
[2870.10s -> 2875.61s]  years ago. This is all kind of irrelevant. Sorry, I've been really bad in muting my sneezes,
[2875.61s -> 2879.61s]  but I figured I'm going to let me be honest with you. If I muted my stream and sneezed,
[2879.61s -> 2884.09s]  it would still show up on your stream. So if I meet, I would have like, I would have fucking
[2884.09s -> 2895.26s]  like you need an actual, you know, come on, be a professional. I would have just panicked
[2895.26s -> 2898.38s]  and pressed a bunch of buttons and probably like restarted my computer accidentally.
[2901.59s -> 2905.83s]  Anything would be better than listening to your bodily fluids like eject from your face.
[2910.50s -> 2911.78s]  You disgust me.
[2922.50s -> 2926.86s]  No. All right. So we're going to go down and this is the hole underneath the
[2926.86s -> 2929.66s]  house eventually or the one that like to the right all the way to the right.
[2930.62s -> 2938.06s]  Oh shit. We need a minotaur. So this would be good for you. How can you let stuff in here?
[2940.06s -> 2947.66s]  I don't know. I don't know. Did you even like clean this up for you? What?
[2948.54s -> 2956.07s]  You let the shit in. Why do you have the door open? You're supposed to be the terraria master.
[2956.97s -> 2965.34s]  What? Oh, because these guys are chumps. How long does the blood moon last? All night. All
[2965.82s -> 2975.21s]  night. All night. I'm getting lots of money and stuff. I need to find the goblin guy.
[2975.21s -> 2978.33s]  I need to make rooms. Germa here, here, here, here's what you're going to have.
[2978.89s -> 2985.53s]  What? I knew my save minutes were skulls. Yeah. Yeah. Hold on.
[2989.88s -> 3003.54s]  Okay. Everyone get high. Can I see some drama hypes in the chat? I don't want to see it.
[3005.91s -> 3010.55s]  Wait, is this? Wait, what? I just picked up so many. There's so much shit out here. What?
[3010.55s -> 3016.50s]  I don't know what this stuff even is. I'm just a vacuum cleaner. Severed hand, blood orb. All
[3016.50s -> 3022.90s]  right. I've never seen this before. Duh. Okay. Try this item. It's, um, you know that, that
[3022.90s -> 3028.74s]  Undertale game? It looks like every character in that game. Undertale. A skull I just dropped down
[3028.74s -> 3033.78s]  here. Have you ever played Undertale? No. Unpleasant, strange skull. Yeah. It deals
[3033.78s -> 3040.50s]  summon damage, but it looks like an actual spell. Um, you meant to say that's, that's, that's just,
[3041.14s -> 3044.42s]  no, no, no. You're talking about one character in Undertale that everybody says that stands,
[3044.42s -> 3050.10s]  right? Okay. That's fine. Like the only character. No, no. It's like, yeah. Have you ever played that
[3050.10s -> 3059.85s]  game? Did you leave this door open? I did. All right. What the fuck does this do? 45 plus one
[3059.85s -> 3065.50s]  summon damage. Summons a ghastly skull to shoot laser beams, which cause damage over time.
[3065.50s -> 3079.93s]  And I, yeah, I don't know really what that means. Once this is, uh, you're having a bad time.
[3085.21s -> 3092.38s]  Kill death. What? I just got an achievement. What does kill death? Dude, I don't, I don't know.
[3093.50s -> 3097.26s]  Ronnie would like to watch your broadcast. A request from steam.
[3097.74s -> 3112.20s]  What is that even that, that, that can't actually be you, Ronnie. I want to watch you play on steam,
[3112.20s -> 3121.56s]  please. That's funny. Oh my God. You're so needy. I want a higher quality version. I forgive you.
[3121.56s -> 3127.99s]  That's a very good joke. That's fine. Cause I talked shit about the cables and then like ignored
[3127.99s -> 3134.41s]  chat and you probably said something. They had to like wallow in pity. Okay. Um, I feel like we've
[3134.41s -> 3139.53s]  been collecting. So no, we're good. We're good. We're good. Go underground and just look for the
[3139.53s -> 3147.45s]  hearts. But let me deposit shit. Also, uh, it might be worth it to use a splunker potion because you
[3147.45s -> 3153.29s]  can see the hearts through walls. Like everything lights up. Okay. Yeah. So if you get, don't use
[3153.29s -> 3158.17s]  like one potion on this. Do not use more than one potion. I'm going to fucking scream. Don't use
[3158.17s -> 3164.97s]  more than one spelunk potion. Spelunker. You ever played spelunky? You know, spelunky two. I have
[3164.97s -> 3168.97s]  played spelunky and I was like, yeah, this is, this is fun, but I didn't really do much in it.
[3168.97s -> 3176.39s]  All right. What am I doing with spelunk? I can't say the half of that word. Just one. You said,
[3177.51s -> 3182.95s]  yeah, it lasts for five minutes. Use it when you go underground. How do I take just one thing out
[3182.95s -> 3190.55s]  of the closet box? I don't know. Just take, I don't know. Oh, I got one. Okay. All right. Use,
[3190.55s -> 3196.23s]  just use it when we go underground and then look for hearts. Yeah. Just run around. You'll like zoom
[3196.23s -> 3203.42s]  out all the way to, don't be a boomer. Put your glasses on. No, I'm not going to do that. Zoom out
[3203.42s -> 3207.74s]  and then you'll be able to see the heart. I can't do that. And you can collect them really quickly.
[3208.70s -> 3226.95s]  Use the skull. What the hell? Is that better than this? Better than what?
[3227.75s -> 3234.49s]  That's, I think it might be better than what I was using before for like my main.
[3236.62s -> 3241.74s]  I based like what I like on about, on sounds though. I'm not sure if I don't like that sound.
[3242.70s -> 3246.81s]  Oh, you don't like the sound. All right. So you said go down underneath our base and just start
[3246.81s -> 3257.59s]  looking for hearts. Yeah. I'm going, I'm going for it. I apologize, but you do not like the sound
[3257.59s -> 3274.31s]  though. How far zoomed he is, is unreal genre. He better zoom out. What I can't, what I, I can't see.
[3275.19s -> 3285.53s]  I'm not doing it. If you waste the spelunker potion, I'm going to be mad.
[3287.05s -> 3290.33s]  Like if you end the spelunker potion and you're like, okay, I got one heart.
[3292.12s -> 3302.50s]  I'm not, I'm at 139%. Remember that. Oh, oh gross. I hate it. All right. I'm taking spelunker
[3302.50s -> 3309.29s]  potion now. Aren't you the same person who, who is like one of the only people that agrees with me
[3310.09s -> 3314.89s]  that path of exile, like makes you vomit because of how close you are to the screen.
[3315.53s -> 3320.81s]  Yes. I, I, but that's different. That's top down. How was that different? Top down view
[3321.93s -> 3330.28s]  and it's 3d. All right. What, will the hearts just be hearts or is it like in a box or something?
[3330.60s -> 3337.16s]  Big red heart crystals. Okay. There is also life ports, which will be like blocks that have hearts
[3337.16s -> 3349.19s]  in them. This is cool though. You can do this. Five minutes of this. That's not that much. We
[3349.19s -> 3366.15s]  can just tell a funny story. What? Dude, I want to hit you. Get out of here. All right.
[3366.15s -> 3374.87s]  I need to go home. Why did you just do the batman? I have one question.
[3379.32s -> 3391.40s]  Batman, the beer. I can't hear the original beer. You know, I'm telling you if you only
[3391.40s -> 3396.84s]  find one of these, dude, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest. I see it. I swear
[3397.08s -> 3411.85s]  fucking good. Let me ask you one question. Superman go. I don't even know. Superman.
[3413.58s -> 3419.42s]  Why would Superman be in the same universe? I know, right? Like who even figured that out?
[3427.29s -> 3438.25s]  We got cool stuff over here. Okay. So it's chest. I don't see any heart though. What is this thing?
[3439.13s -> 3449.66s]  It's like a person's house. Okay. Uh, arcane band, bomb, shuriken,
[3450.38s -> 3457.74s]  swift, miss potion, recall potion, and some torches. All right. Very cool. Very cool. And water.
[3459.58s -> 3479.06s]  Water. I found one. Shoot him. Dude, you know what we really need right now is a freaking
[3479.06s -> 3485.94s]  poon hammer. What the fuck are you talking about? Is that really loud? Did I peek the mic on that?
[3486.58s -> 3491.37s]  Oh, if you want to hear a mic being peaked, I got it. Don't fucking do it. Like everybody hates
[3491.37s -> 3506.52s]  that. Nobody likes that. All right. I got it. Life crystal. So just take it, right? Yeah. And
[3506.52s -> 3515.27s]  it's a 20 HP. Cool. Now this is the part of the game that I was talking about. That's the part
[3515.27s -> 3521.29s]  again that I wanted to see. You're like about spawning bosses and going and picking up meteors.
[3521.29s -> 3525.21s]  I wanted to go look. You're doing it. It's dude. It's the problem is that I've had to hold your
[3525.21s -> 3531.37s]  hand at every step. It's the part of the game you want to see is exploring and fucking go do it.
[3531.37s -> 3536.89s]  Every time I go do it, you go, Oh boy, I need a demon, demon, uh, Titan or hold on.
[3539.32s -> 3545.72s]  I have been very respectful of you. I've been patient. I haven't. Not at all. Everyone was
[3545.72s -> 3549.72s]  like, man, stars, like really like fucking trying to rush him. I don't like it.
[3549.72s -> 3556.04s]  And I kept muting last stream going like, I know, what the fuck? I don't know what to do.
[3556.04s -> 3573.74s]  Like, what the fuck? No, that's not how that happened. What do we got in here? Have you found
[3573.74s -> 3584.04s]  one? I'm not looking. Wait, you're the one with the potion. We don't both have the potion. Why
[3584.04s -> 3588.04s]  didn't you take one and do this? There's nothing in this chest. How the fuck is that possible?
[3588.68s -> 3595.75s]  So are we splitting these? Just keep using them.
[3596.39s -> 3613.58s]  What is it? 180. All right. You have max health right now? Yeah. I might have spunky potion right
[3613.58s -> 3630.74s]  now. Can you deliver one? Can I, can I Uber Eats a spunky potion? I don't even need it. I'll find
[3630.74s -> 3659.98s]  one. Okay. Not bad. What is that? What is this thing? What was that? A dragon? Hey, I just
[3659.98s -> 3672.86s]  killed the dragon down here. He dropped a starfish. Good job. Good job, buddy.
[3681.27s -> 3689.29s]  Ooh, what's this? Chest. How can I, how can I have? Did something happen here? Why can only have two
[3689.29s -> 3703.48s]  of these? It was three before. Am I missing something here? Does it say they count as two
[3703.48s -> 3710.44s]  on the staff? No, no, no, no, no, no. Because your bewitching table probably just wore off.
[3715.78s -> 3722.44s]  Cool. Recall potion. I got some recall potions though we can share. You don't share them. You
[3722.44s -> 3732.30s]  have the mirror. Oh, I thought that, no, doesn't not wormhole. All right. Sword items. Wait.
[3736.34s -> 3750.92s]  I'll figure this out later. I don't really like this thing. It might pick up at bosses,
[3750.92s -> 3753.24s]  but it takes like kind of too long and it can't shoot through walls.
[3754.44s -> 3765.72s]  Hold on. I'm getting to like the water here. Water. I'm kind of concerned about this.
[3767.54s -> 3773.58s]  What is that? What's a giant clam? Giant clam down here.
[3774.68s -> 3789.75s]  I found the giant clam star. Come to me. Where is he? What do you want? I was busy
[3789.75s -> 3797.34s]  blittling my chat. I got a giant clam here. There's a giant clam boss. Oh, okay. I'm coming.
[3800.70s -> 3807.14s]  I don't know where it is. It's here somewhere. Um, we're going to have to go underwater and we like
[3807.14s -> 3813.58s]  can't breathe underwater. It's a shitty ball, like easy to kill for us. Yeah. But still we can't
[3813.58s -> 3819.16s]  breathe underwater and now I'm wasting my. Oh, it's right here. Yeah. What are you talking about?
[3823.42s -> 3824.46s]  Oh shit. He's right here.
[3826.78s -> 3831.02s]  Dead. Okay. Yeah. It's like one of the first bosses you're supposed to kill,
[3831.02s -> 3841.26s]  but he makes an NPC summon. Oh, okay. Well, that thing was really stupid. All right. Let
[3841.26s -> 3848.20s]  me see if I can find another heart. Ami, Amidius, Amidius, the sea king. What does that guy do?
[3848.20s -> 3857.98s]  Anything cool? The NPC. Yeah, there's a guy down there now. Yeah, he sells, uh, he sells weapons.
[3858.94s -> 3871.08s]  Are they good? They're okay. I think we're a little bit past them now. I just need like another heart.
[3871.72s -> 3881.51s]  How many do you need? What's the max health? The max is 300. I need like five of them then.
[3882.15s -> 3886.23s]  Have you just been taking them? I have two. All right. That should be fine.
[3887.54s -> 3890.10s]  No, we have to get you to 300 because then there's like a,
[3890.90s -> 3899.10s]  just, just, we're getting you to 300. Don't, don't give up. Okay. I'm going to run out of
[3899.10s -> 3907.72s]  like inventory space. How many do you need? What are you at? I'm at 180.
[3910.60s -> 3915.48s]  Yeah, I'm telling you, you've been eating these and like you, you just been eating all the lunch.
[3915.48s -> 3918.68s]  You're also not very good at finding them. I've got three already.
[3920.01s -> 3922.33s]  I had the Spelunky potion and there was only one over here.
[3923.21s -> 3927.29s]  Well, you gotta, you gotta go quickly through the ground, cover the most ground, zoom out.
[3927.29s -> 3937.26s]  I'm zoomed out. About 400 is max, by the way. I, I, it was gonna preemptively warn you to not
[3937.26s -> 3941.74s]  listen to your chat on this shit, Jerma, but you're falling for it. They think they're smart. They
[3941.74s -> 3946.06s]  think they know what they're talking about and they're going to backseat you. They angst me at
[3946.06s -> 3951.50s]  the 400, but you need to just like fucking smack them and keep them in line. Tell them you're the
[3951.50s -> 3959.38s]  streamer and to trust you. Can you do that? Why would I ever strike somebody in my chair?
[3960.18s -> 3971.05s]  That's fucking uncalled for. That's the only way some people learn. What the fuck is a rude
[3971.05s -> 3980.15s]  elemental? It's really mean. It's kind of like what I'm doing right now. Is there one above me?
[3986.02s -> 3993.32s]  These guys are really distracting. They're like just screaming in my ear, it seems. Hold on,
[3993.32s -> 4006.54s]  just despawn them? Yeah, but what if I get attacked and I need them?
[4007.34s -> 4014.17s]  Jerma, you don't need anybody. Is there nothing up here? There's nothing. You're a star all on
[4014.17s -> 4020.94s]  your own. You don't need these people. Uh, there's another giant clam. Ignore him.
[4025.66s -> 4032.73s]  There's a chest here. Um, there's a worm in here too, apparently. What is this?
[4035.58s -> 4045.94s]  Cloud in a bottle. Stop. What the fuck? Wait, what? You motherfucker. Really? What are you doing here?
[4047.78s -> 4050.98s]  Get away from me. Okay, I've got four hearts for you.
[4062.94s -> 4068.38s]  Dude. Okay, this is what we call unfair. He's dead, but I don't want to- that's bullshit.
[4069.26s -> 4079.64s]  I'm eating this fucking hamburger. What the fuck else is even else in here?
[4081.34s -> 4090.34s]  Giant pearl. I don't have an inventory space. Where are my summons? Summon them. Then
[4091.14s -> 4096.50s]  it doesn't want to give them to me anymore. They might be stuck somewhere else so you can
[4096.50s -> 4108.34s]  unsummon them by the stat underneath your bar door. Mud blocks. I have like mud.
[4109.30s -> 4115.72s]  That's funny to you. It's kind of funny because like I don't want this stuff.
[4117.32s -> 4130.89s]  Have you been auto trashing things? No. Get on it. Rope. I don't have any rope. Dangerous potion.
[4133.45s -> 4145.85s]  I swear I had a- hold on. I swear I had a shadow key. My god, how do I just delete an item?
[4145.85s -> 4153.54s]  How do you just delete an item? You drag it to the bottom right of your inventory. What the fuck?
[4153.54s -> 4169.85s]  Oh my god. There was a door in there. Okay, Jerma, I don't know what you're on about,
[4169.85s -> 4172.09s]  but here you can have- The trash in the lower right,
[4172.09s -> 4182.36s]  you said. I'm putting it and it just like takes up the space. What? Why? Oh my god. No,
[4182.36s -> 4188.52s]  it doesn't. Why does it just not just disappear? It's the last thing you delete it in case you
[4188.52s -> 4194.36s]  want to take it out. Oh god damn it. I was saying- The one to the left of that is auto
[4194.36s -> 4197.80s]  delete and everything you put on that list the moment you pick it up at auto trash.
[4199.08s -> 4202.36s]  Because I'm sitting there going like why is this like taking up an inventory space now?
[4203.24s -> 4211.66s]  Hello. Here's four life crystals. Don't delete them. Also, here's an item that you will enjoy.
[4214.17s -> 4217.37s]  You know, try that that hasty necromancer's heart out a little bit.
[4219.56s -> 4227.00s]  Just laughing. Just laughing. Just laugh it up. Don't drown in your bath tonight. Get some water
[4227.00s -> 4233.59s]  wings. It was like two feet of water. I know. That's why I thought it was safe. Look, there's
[4233.59s -> 4244.20s]  a lot going on there, okay? What did I just- I have a full inventory. Get rid of this. Everybody,
[4244.84s -> 4251.40s]  we're real worried about you. I'm fine. Relax. You didn't tell me that I had to do that.
[4252.58s -> 4256.50s]  I did. It was one of the very first things I explained. And that was also a week and a half
[4256.50s -> 4265.26s]  ago. I thought that you would have a memory of a week. Oh yeah? Well, how come you didn't know how
[4265.26s -> 4270.30s]  to turn the server on correctly this week? What was it? I distinctly remember you saying,
[4270.30s -> 4274.46s]  I forgot how we did this last week. That's a distinct thing that I heard last week. Is that
[4274.46s -> 4283.64s]  not true? I don't think that happened. Hey, is the server working? You ain't gonna fucking fool me.
[4284.20s -> 4294.39s]  All right, slowly. Let me- 20 minutes. That's way better than this. All right, so the cloud in a
[4294.39s -> 4303.51s]  bottle. Yeah. So there's like different versions of that cloud. Fleeting cloud. Intrepid cloud.
[4304.79s -> 4308.95s]  When it says that, that's the stat associated with it. Or it'll be like plus three move speed
[4308.95s -> 4313.59s]  or something random on it. And you can re-roll that stat. Do you want this one that has- But
[4313.59s -> 4322.26s]  we don't have that melee speed? No. So should I just dump it somewhere? You can probably just
[4322.26s -> 4328.33s]  sell it. All right, well what is this? What am I doing? Release bees, win damage. That's good.
[4329.45s -> 4333.06s]  After taking damage, let me deal damage to all nearby nodes. That's all right. This one's not
[4333.06s -> 4342.23s]  that great though. Yeah, that one's not that- I mean, you take a lot of damage. Can you go over
[4342.23s -> 4350.04s]  max mana? Yes. Items will go over max mana. Okay. Yeah, just I'm making sure. So max mana is just
[4350.04s -> 4354.36s]  how many stars you can use. And then there's some items later on that'll give you like a hundred
[4354.36s -> 4368.01s]  plus max mana. Right. Okay, that's cool. Should I pick up anything else? Let me see this. Fashions
[4368.01s -> 4373.29s]  mana powered armor. So that I'm assuming this, I can take hits with my mana bar instead of my health
[4373.29s -> 4380.79s]  bar. I'm assuming. Yeah. Dwyane's effect. That's actually really good. Sometimes I don't know if
[4380.79s -> 4386.71s]  you're asking me a question, your chat a question, or yourself. All at the same time. Because I feel
[4386.71s -> 4393.19s]  like- I feel like I'm falling for a trap if I answer you. No. Like he's going to figure this
[4393.19s -> 4401.82s]  out himself in like two seconds, right? But it's rude to ignore you. No, I'm just talking. I just-
[4402.70s -> 4414.70s]  What? You don't like talk out loud? Only works if you have no armor or vanity armor equipped. Well,
[4414.70s -> 4418.78s]  that's kind of- Oh, that item is not good. Yeah, I was gonna say that was gonna be some.
[4420.89s -> 4431.02s]  Necromancer's Heart. Max number of centuries by one. Decreases your life regen. Oh, shit.
[4432.31s -> 4440.47s]  It's worth it. Oh, but okay. What is this? A helmet? It's an accessory. Oh, shit. Okay.
[4440.47s -> 4447.46s]  Okay. It's a necromancer's heart. Do I put this on my head?
[4449.30s -> 4455.74s]  Stick it on. Is this a hat? I don't know if it's like a chest piece. You know how games are.
[4457.02s -> 4461.02s]  Yeah. That rune of bleeding. I know how games are. I'm gonna switch out the rune of bleeding.
[4462.46s -> 4475.37s]  Because I like this one. I like the double jump. What is making that loud ass noise over here?
[4476.60s -> 4483.10s]  That's a little bit of a rumor. All right. So, what do you want to know? That we have some health?
[4484.70s -> 4490.22s]  You need to get to 300 health. I need to have 300. Okay. You are not allowed to do anything
[4490.22s -> 4495.58s]  else until you get there. Okay. I'm not allowed to do anything else. Okay. I'm running
[4496.86s -> 4505.05s]  an associated errand. Okay. I'm gonna go- Do you care if I take another Spelunky potion?
[4505.69s -> 4511.82s]  Or will you be mad at me for that? You know, I'll accept it. I accept
[4511.82s -> 4516.06s]  that this is the way things are just gonna have to be. And then when we kill Plantera
[4516.06s -> 4519.74s]  and we don't have any freaking Spelunky potions, I'll just know who to blame.
[4524.36s -> 4527.48s]  Okay. So, don't take one. Is that what you're saying?
[4527.48s -> 4532.82s]  No. Go ahead. Just do whatever you want. It's what you normally do anyway.
[4533.94s -> 4536.79s]  There's none even in here. Oh, yeah. I took them.
[4536.79s -> 4540.55s]  Oh. Was that your insurance policy to make sure I could have taken them?
[4540.55s -> 4543.67s]  Oh, no. Because I used one to help you find them. And I got you four.
[4546.26s -> 4550.55s]  And you got one. I was just, you know, just trying to help.
[4554.82s -> 4563.45s]  I'm gonna bring the bombs down with me. I'm gonna start blowing stuff up down there.
[4571.59s -> 4581.59s]  I don't- All right. It's time to go on an explosion spree.
[4585.03s -> 4591.67s]  Three, four. All right. And I can have one, two. That's insane. That's awesome. Cool.
[4592.47s -> 4598.62s]  All right. I'm gonna go down. Just pick a spot and just go down.
[4599.50s -> 4605.02s]  I might even pass you. I would say hello on the way down.
[4607.78s -> 4622.79s]  No. No, kid. Your aeon's behind me. You're like a roach to me.
[4623.51s -> 4634.58s]  All right. I don't think I'm gonna go down this far. I'm gonna go over here.
[4634.58s -> 4639.30s]  I mean, as long as there's an easy path to just run along quickly is all you need.
[4639.30s -> 4642.87s]  I guess I'm just gonna go right now. Also, if you went to the jungle,
[4642.87s -> 4645.83s]  there is usually a lot in the jungle and the jungle is pretty open.
[4646.79s -> 4649.51s]  The jungle? I probably already used the potion, so it's-
[4649.51s -> 4652.79s]  I did not use any potion. I don't have any potions. You took them all.
[4653.67s -> 4658.55s]  I'm gonna go up. Don't go as far down as, like, the water?
[4660.87s -> 4667.43s]  Here. Do this. Go back up to the surface and then keep walking left until you get to the jungle.
[4667.43s -> 4670.15s]  It'll be the area that's jungly and green and muddy.
[4673.62s -> 4677.54s]  And you should pretty easily be able to find some in there. If not, some chests and other stuff
[4677.54s -> 4680.58s]  because we haven't been in the dungeon at all or in the jungle at all.
[4683.03s -> 4701.61s]  On my way. Look at this guy. I don't think I'm gonna get a lot of use out of that.
[4701.61s -> 4704.65s]  All right. There's a way we can- This looks kind of jungly, doesn't it?
[4705.61s -> 4715.88s]  This is not the jungle? I guess not.
[4715.88s -> 4727.35s]  Jerm's gonna hate the jungle, I feel. Why do you feel that?
[4742.52s -> 4761.24s]  This is desert. I think I'm getting close. Did you open this chest already?
[4761.96s -> 4774.57s]  I mean, I'm at the meteor. There's nothing even down over here.
[4780.25s -> 4784.23s]  Meteor head and keep going left.
[4785.82s -> 4789.10s]  Past the meteor. Past the meteor.
[4789.10s -> 4801.48s]  Okay. Ouch! I was prepared for that jump.
[4803.27s -> 4805.91s]  Ouch! I see what you're doing there.
[4805.91s -> 4808.23s]  All right. Then up this hill, there's the giant hole.
[4808.23s -> 4809.75s]  And just keep going down the giant hole.
[4812.79s -> 4814.47s]  And this does look like a jungle.
[4821.29s -> 4825.61s]  All right. I am at a hole that's in the ground. Is that the one you're talking about?
[4825.61s -> 4826.89s]  This big one that's down here? Yep.
[4826.89s -> 4828.57s]  All right. Yep.
[4828.57s -> 4829.93s]  Let's go get some hearts.
[4830.73s -> 4832.89s]  Stand back. I'm gonna throw bombs everywhere.
[4855.34s -> 4857.90s]  These are not as strong as I thought they were gonna be.
[4857.90s -> 4861.26s]  They're actually very weak, but it's okay. I have a lot of them.
[4865.06s -> 4885.80s]  Okay. Nothing yet. Is that gonna hit me?
[4887.10s -> 4890.44s]  No. Yes. Watch out.
[4890.44s -> 4893.64s]  It's not gonna hit me. All right. Spot.
[4893.64s -> 4910.58s]  Let's take a look. Oops. Oops.
[4912.30s -> 4914.38s]  Oopsies. No. Even better.
[4917.27s -> 4919.78s]  All right. I think there's something right here.
[4922.62s -> 4928.42s]  Pretty cool. Found a little cave system.
[4952.62s -> 4953.74s]  All right. Keeps going down.
[4955.10s -> 4958.62s]  There's no internet in the jungle.
[4959.74s -> 4962.09s]  All right. Hold on a minute here.
[4964.82s -> 4966.26s]  I ain't gonna fucking screw around.
[4967.14s -> 4972.60s]  All right. It's safe.
[4973.72s -> 4981.08s]  Moon glow? Just bomb it.
[4982.28s -> 4993.72s]  Did you say you were gonna teleport to me?
[4995.80s -> 5000.44s]  Soon. I'm trying to get you the thing that you need to have after you've
[5000.44s -> 5001.72s]  finished getting life crystals.
[5001.72s -> 5004.36s]  Ooh. Yellow slug. Okay. This is something down here.
[5007.48s -> 5007.96s]  All right. I got one.
[5007.96s -> 5009.40s]  I'm planning for your future.
[5009.40s -> 5015.91s]  I found one. Life crystal.
[5019.10s -> 5022.23s]  And spiked anklet of the wind.
[5024.18s -> 5027.62s]  10% increased movement speed and plus 2% damage.
[5029.90s -> 5030.78s]  That seems pretty great.
[5031.50s -> 5035.10s]  And it combines with something else, I think, to make like lightning boots or something.
[5035.10s -> 5041.62s]  Damn. Artery potion. Recall potion.
[5044.33s -> 5045.69s]  And a honey dispenser.
[5046.73s -> 5053.94s]  Oh, nice. Okay.
[5053.94s -> 5057.80s]  What about this thing? Green torch.
[5058.52s -> 5059.08s]  I want that.
[5059.88s -> 5061.67s]  Oh, all right. I need...
[5063.35s -> 5065.24s]  I need one more heart.
[5065.80s -> 5067.72s]  So don't even use the potion.
[5067.72s -> 5068.68s]  There's no reason to do that.
[5070.15s -> 5071.59s]  Okay. I mean, I'm gonna...
[5071.59s -> 5072.39s]  I just need one more.
[5075.74s -> 5088.50s]  Okay. No, I'm not gonna drown in here.
[5089.30s -> 5090.76s]  Oh. I'm gonna make sure of that.
[5091.96s -> 5093.80s]  What? What's wrong?
[5093.80s -> 5097.42s]  What? Nothing.
[5097.42s -> 5099.34s]  It's fine. Everything's fine.
[5099.42s -> 5101.10s]  It was almost bad, but it's fine.
[5101.90s -> 5109.14s]  I want to get in there.
[5109.70s -> 5111.18s]  I feel like I'm...
[5111.18s -> 5112.14s]  I feel like I'll drown in there.
[5112.14s -> 5112.94s]  I think I really might.
[5112.94s -> 5113.66s]  Club tornado?
[5114.54s -> 5116.18s]  Tornado.
[5116.18s -> 5118.74s]  All right. No, I'm gonna go this way.
[5118.74s -> 5120.42s]  I feel like that's underwater. I don't like that.
[5121.46s -> 5127.08s]  Dude, just bomb everything.
[5127.08s -> 5127.80s]  That's what I'm doing.
[5128.76s -> 5129.26s]  Nice.
[5129.96s -> 5137.85s]  Didn't I have more bombs than that?
[5138.73s -> 5142.49s]  I thought I had more bombs than that.
[5143.37s -> 5144.98s]  I guess I used them all.
[5147.24s -> 5147.80s]  Time to dig.
[5147.80s -> 5148.76s]  You did use a bit.
[5149.72s -> 5158.84s]  Get the fish. Fish. Fish.
[5159.48s -> 5162.15s]  Do I? No, I don't.
[5162.15s -> 5163.03s]  I don't have to get the fish.
[5163.75s -> 5171.13s]  All right. This...
[5171.69s -> 5172.65s]  Hold on a minute here.
[5173.37s -> 5176.66s]  It's safe.
[5177.46s -> 5178.58s]  Ooh. I can go that way.
[5182.20s -> 5182.92s]  What's this way?
[5185.22s -> 5186.02s]  So much to learn.
[5191.88s -> 5194.55s]  You killed a hellbat.
[5194.55s -> 5195.11s]  Good for you.
[5195.83s -> 5204.94s]  I don't think there's anything up there.
[5204.94s -> 5205.50s]  I'll go down here.
[5216.90s -> 5217.70s]  Mud block, right?
[5221.43s -> 5222.95s]  The mud block is gonna be auto-deleted
[5222.95s -> 5224.23s]  when it's in that right slot, right?
[5225.19s -> 5225.69s]  Yeah.
[5226.47s -> 5227.35s]  Left slot.
[5227.35s -> 5228.15s]  The left slot.
[5228.79s -> 5231.21s]  The left slot is your list of...
[5233.30s -> 5233.86s]  Enable auto-trash.
[5233.86s -> 5234.90s]  I mean, it's on the right
[5234.90s -> 5236.18s]  but the left one on the right.
[5238.82s -> 5241.74s]  How do I put something in there?
[5241.74s -> 5243.74s]  Enable auto-trash to automatically trash items.
[5243.74s -> 5244.54s]  Is it not enabled?
[5244.54s -> 5245.26s]  How do I enable it?
[5246.54s -> 5248.46s]  The top button, I think, enables it.
[5249.26s -> 5249.90s]  One of them does.
[5249.90s -> 5251.42s]  There's like side buttons on it.
[5253.77s -> 5254.49s]  Oh, okay. There we go.
[5258.07s -> 5259.43s]  This is kind of blending in.
[5269.14s -> 5269.70s]  What's down here?
[5272.49s -> 5274.17s]  Pee-pee-poo-poo is down there.
[5275.13s -> 5275.63s]  Nice.
[5276.65s -> 5277.21s]  Nice, dude.
[5277.21s -> 5277.93s]  Nice.
[5277.93s -> 5278.49s]  Yeah.
[5278.49s -> 5278.99s]  Epic.
[5279.45s -> 5280.01s]  Hello.
[5280.01s -> 5281.77s]  It pulls out a pee-pee-poo-poo.
[5282.65s -> 5284.01s]  I love pee-pee-poo-poo.
[5284.57s -> 5287.21s]  You're really gonna pull out a pee-pee-poo-poo?
[5289.35s -> 5290.15s]  Yeah.
[5290.15s -> 5291.27s]  Unbelievable.
[5291.27s -> 5295.59s]  Oh, come on. Where's one?
[5295.59s -> 5296.23s]  I need one more.
[5297.35s -> 5299.51s]  How many life quarts has he walked by?
[5300.39s -> 5301.90s]  Zero.
[5301.90s -> 5303.34s]  I've been getting my eyes open.
[5303.34s -> 5308.41s]  You've been getting life quarts when you see it.
[5309.21s -> 5311.00s]  It's the...
[5311.00s -> 5311.80s]  I know what it looks like.
[5312.44s -> 5324.17s]  Life? What do you mean, life?
[5324.17s -> 5325.85s]  Yeah, he has no clue.
[5329.83s -> 5330.79s]  What do you mean, life? Cool.
[5330.79s -> 5331.83s]  You don't have to tell me something.
[5331.83s -> 5333.59s]  It's different than the heart crystal.
[5333.59s -> 5334.55s]  It's a block.
[5334.55s -> 5335.67s]  It's heart blocks.
[5335.67s -> 5337.99s]  And when you combine 10, you get a life crystal.
[5337.99s -> 5339.03s]  Oh, okay.
[5341.10s -> 5341.60s]  Cool.
[5343.98s -> 5344.86s]  That's really good to know.
[5345.42s -> 5346.46s]  I'm glad that you told me this.
[5347.18s -> 5348.06s]  I did earlier.
[5350.38s -> 5350.86s]  Hey, it doesn't matter.
[5350.86s -> 5351.42s]  What did you say?
[5351.42s -> 5351.90s]  That you're like...
[5353.26s -> 5354.06s]  It doesn't matter.
[5354.06s -> 5354.56s]  I'm done.
[5355.26s -> 5357.27s]  It doesn't matter.
[5357.27s -> 5357.77s]  I'm good.
[5358.47s -> 5358.97s]  Okay.
[5360.41s -> 5361.77s]  Holy fucking God.
[5361.77s -> 5363.21s]  That would have been so embarrassing.
[5363.21s -> 5365.37s]  That would have been an actually, horribly embarrassing thing.
[5366.25s -> 5369.94s]  I would have had to delete my Twitch account
[5369.94s -> 5371.78s]  if I just fell there and died because it was dark.
[5374.33s -> 5376.41s]  All right, let me just get up there with the rope.
[5377.29s -> 5378.17s]  You move in a mixer?
[5380.47s -> 5382.55s]  It's a really easy, funny joke to make, you know?
[5383.91s -> 5386.95s]  I mean, you really don't have to be funny on Twitch.
[5386.95s -> 5390.55s]  You just have to stay current with whatever the current thing everyone is saying.
[5390.55s -> 5393.75s]  And then you'll be like, accepted into the fold.
[5393.75s -> 5395.35s]  I have 300.
[5395.35s -> 5401.38s]  You're trying too hard with your carnivals and your fucking movie nights.
[5403.53s -> 5405.72s]  Just like, come on.
[5406.92s -> 5408.12s]  Cut his mic quick.
[5412.55s -> 5413.67s]  What the fuck?
[5413.67s -> 5414.17s]  Okay.
[5414.63s -> 5419.13s]  I think I just would have died, but I landed on health.
[5419.85s -> 5421.37s]  Yeah, just throw your cat.
[5421.37s -> 5422.17s]  Get your dog in there.
[5422.17s -> 5423.37s]  Get Otto in there and chuck him.
[5424.01s -> 5430.18s]  I would never do that to a fucking dog.
[5430.18s -> 5433.82s]  You are fucked.
[5433.82s -> 5435.10s]  Hey, I got another one.
[5435.90s -> 5438.46s]  Does Otto ever do malicious poops?
[5438.46s -> 5440.62s]  Like, what's with dogs and malicious poops?
[5441.98s -> 5442.86s]  Why are you saying it like that?
[5443.66s -> 5447.56s]  Well, where it's like they poop somewhere they know they're not supposed to
[5447.56s -> 5449.96s]  because they're like, they're trying to get back at you.
[5451.43s -> 5455.51s]  Like me and Ashley left the house the other day for a while together
[5455.51s -> 5458.55s]  and she like, hates when people leave like all dogs do.
[5458.55s -> 5461.35s]  But she's like, such a baby.
[5461.35s -> 5464.79s]  I come back and there's two poops like hidden in my bathroom behind the toilet.
[5466.41s -> 5467.37s]  Malicious poops.
[5467.93s -> 5468.73s]  All right, I'm coming back.
[5469.69s -> 5470.81s]  I have 300 health.
[5471.45s -> 5475.29s]  Are you ready to move on?
[5475.29s -> 5476.17s]  I got 300 HP.
[5476.81s -> 5478.10s]  Oh, I'm ready to move on.
[5480.36s -> 5480.86s]  Are you?
[5481.80s -> 5483.72s]  Oh, yeah, I have 300 health.
[5484.94s -> 5485.34s]  Are you?
[5485.34s -> 5487.26s]  Wasn't that the whole point, me to get 300 health?
[5488.31s -> 5489.75s]  All right, this really good ring.
[5490.31s -> 5491.35s]  Do you like want this?
[5491.91s -> 5494.58s]  I don't even know what the hell it is.
[5496.09s -> 5496.59s]  What ring?
[5497.29s -> 5498.81s]  This, no, this anklet, sorry.
[5499.69s -> 5501.13s]  10% increased storage speed.
[5507.00s -> 5509.08s]  All right, let me make sure I have everything I want.
[5509.08s -> 5510.12s]  Torch.
[5510.12s -> 5512.26s]  I want that one.
[5512.26s -> 5515.38s]  I'm almost out of apples.
[5517.54s -> 5518.42s]  Severed hand.
[5520.71s -> 5521.43s]  Auto trash.
[5522.07s -> 5522.95s]  Is it just throw away?
[5523.83s -> 5524.87s]  Auto trash.
[5525.59s -> 5525.91s]  Okay.
[5525.91s -> 5527.03s]  You're going to pick up a lot of them.
[5528.54s -> 5529.66s]  Anyone buy these off you?
[5532.74s -> 5533.30s]  Not worried.
[5533.86s -> 5537.16s]  I had mud blocks in auto trash.
[5537.80s -> 5542.58s]  Oh, what the hell's going on here?
[5542.58s -> 5542.98s]  I'm zoom.
[5542.98s -> 5543.78s]  I need to zoom in.
[5545.14s -> 5548.82s]  You know, you can auto trash more than one thing.
[5551.22s -> 5551.78s]  Right?
[5551.78s -> 5557.42s]  I think you're getting that, right?
[5558.14s -> 5560.42s]  Like, how do I add another slot?
[5562.09s -> 5565.61s]  Every time you put something in the auto trash slot, it is auto trashed.
[5566.89s -> 5568.41s]  Even if you'll never pick it up again.
[5568.41s -> 5571.29s]  So every, even if you stack it on top of it.
[5572.09s -> 5572.49s]  Yeah.
[5572.49s -> 5575.21s]  And then if you, oh, okay.
[5575.21s -> 5576.73s]  And then if you, how do you do it?
[5578.54s -> 5579.90s]  I can use the middle button.
[5579.90s -> 5582.22s]  If you click the middle button, it shows you everything that's in there.
[5582.22s -> 5583.58s]  And then you can remove things later.
[5583.58s -> 5584.14s]  That's good to know.
[5584.14s -> 5584.64s]  Okay.
[5586.35s -> 5586.59s]  All right.
[5586.59s -> 5589.23s]  I believe I'm ready to do whatever you want to know.
[5592.25s -> 5592.75s]  Okay.
[5592.81s -> 5594.97s]  Um, 139.
[5594.97s -> 5596.09s]  I know I'm compromising.
[5597.13s -> 5599.21s]  Give me like, give me like, I'm coming.
[5599.21s -> 5599.85s]  I'm coming.
[5599.85s -> 5600.35s]  I'm coming.
[5601.39s -> 5601.63s]  Okay.
[5601.63s -> 5601.95s]  Come here.
[5601.95s -> 5602.45s]  Come here.
[5604.65s -> 5606.57s]  Take these blazing hearts for you.
[5607.87s -> 5609.07s]  Now use those.
[5609.07s -> 5611.15s]  Those are the new life crystal.
[5611.15s -> 5611.65s]  Wow.
[5617.36s -> 5619.28s]  I couldn't find many more of them though.
[5619.28s -> 5620.00s]  That's fine.
[5620.88s -> 5621.52s]  We'll be fine.
[5622.08s -> 5622.72s]  I'm sorry.
[5623.95s -> 5625.23s]  You didn't use the last crystal.
[5625.87s -> 5626.67s]  I, it couldn't.
[5626.67s -> 5627.47s]  I, I couldn't.
[5627.47s -> 5628.43s]  It's, it's stored.
[5629.15s -> 5630.35s]  There's a life crystal just in there.
[5630.35s -> 5632.35s]  Can you do anything with them after you reach max HP?
[5634.64s -> 5635.92s]  I don't think so.
[5635.92s -> 5638.16s]  There might be some recipes with them so I'd keep it.
[5638.80s -> 5639.60s]  But I forget.
[5639.60s -> 5641.04s]  Just in the stash.
[5641.84s -> 5643.60s]  There's a fucking fireplace in here.
[5643.60s -> 5644.56s]  This guy's crazy.
[5651.79s -> 5653.74s]  Okay.
[5655.37s -> 5655.87s]  All right.
[5659.45s -> 5660.01s]  Very cool.
[5660.01s -> 5661.45s]  I need some more torches.
[5661.45s -> 5662.33s]  Are we going somewhere dark?
[5663.66s -> 5667.48s]  Um, I don't know yet.
[5668.11s -> 5670.27s]  Torches are wood and what was it?
[5670.27s -> 5672.27s]  Wood and gel or something.
[5672.27s -> 5672.67s]  And gel.
[5675.40s -> 5676.36s]  We don't have any wood.
[5677.16s -> 5679.60s]  Gonna have to cut down some trees.
[5680.24s -> 5680.88s]  Do you have any wood?
[5682.41s -> 5682.89s]  Nope.
[5682.89s -> 5684.65s]  Do we have any trees left to cut down?
[5685.53s -> 5687.28s]  Or just buy?
[5687.28s -> 5690.48s]  Uh, yeah, there's trees all over the map.
[5690.48s -> 5691.12s]  Left or right?
[5691.12s -> 5697.63s]  Uh, I think I might've damned him.
[5698.27s -> 5698.91s]  Oh, he's here.
[5699.95s -> 5700.19s]  Yeah.
[5700.19s -> 5701.47s]  This guy, the old guy with the beard.
[5706.49s -> 5708.89s]  I think I might've damned him.
[5708.89s -> 5710.17s]  I think I might've damned him.
[5710.89s -> 5711.21s]  Yeah.
[5711.21s -> 5712.97s]  I think he might be gone for all eternity.
[5713.53s -> 5714.33s]  Let's do 100.
[5716.81s -> 5717.13s]  All right.
[5718.28s -> 5721.08s]  Where to now that we have good HP?
[5722.12s -> 5722.84s]  What's the plan?
[5722.84s -> 5725.82s]  Um, slime god.
[5725.82s -> 5726.46s]  Slime god.
[5728.38s -> 5728.86s]  All right.
[5728.86s -> 5729.82s]  Let's go kick his ass.
[5730.38s -> 5733.79s]  Hey, baby.
[5733.79s -> 5737.87s]  Next time that I see you in the game, I can kick your ass.
[5745.42s -> 5750.14s]  Uh, we need one little ingredient.
[5750.14s -> 5755.00s]  You guys seriously don't remember that Reggie quote?
[5755.00s -> 5758.67s]  And so I'm glad that one person got that.
[5760.43s -> 5761.39s]  I actually forgot too.
[5761.39s -> 5762.03s]  Who's Reggie?
[5768.40s -> 5771.36s]  It's from the Nintendo World Championships 2014.
[5772.80s -> 5775.68s]  See, I didn't know that part, but you did.
[5775.68s -> 5776.32s]  And that's good.
[5781.44s -> 5786.00s]  As somebody myself who's sick of companies and corporations and people selling out,
[5786.00s -> 5789.92s]  I for one love Reggie Fils-A-Mate for selling me Nintendo games.
[5789.92s -> 5790.64s]  He made it fun.
[5792.67s -> 5793.07s]  You can't.
[5793.79s -> 5794.35s]  I'm sorry.
[5794.35s -> 5798.27s]  There are some things that you just you cannot like talk shit about Reggie.
[5798.27s -> 5799.95s]  You can't like that.
[5799.95s -> 5801.47s]  I there's some things that I would tolerate.
[5804.08s -> 5808.16s]  He worked his way into my heart through a very calculated marketing plan that he himself
[5808.16s -> 5809.20s]  didn't even come up.
[5809.20s -> 5811.04s]  I fucking love that guy.
[5811.04s -> 5813.84s]  I mean, I'm just I'm not I'm not gonna I can't stand for that like at all.
[5814.96s -> 5815.44s]  You know what?
[5816.64s -> 5820.48s]  Maybe like maybe like one guy in either of our chats really thought about it for a second.
[5820.48s -> 5821.20s]  I was like, you know what?
[5822.64s -> 5825.36s]  Stir is a salty ball sack, but he might be right.
[5830.09s -> 5834.09s]  Okay, I can't agree with his lifestyle, but cut his bike.
[5834.09s -> 5841.02s]  I'm about to he's going to get his mic cut quick.
[5843.64s -> 5844.28s]  All right.
[5844.28s -> 5845.16s]  Uh, I'm ready.
[5845.16s -> 5847.16s]  I got my bacon cheeseburger.
[5847.16s -> 5847.64s]  I'm ready.
[5848.83s -> 5849.79s]  No, just sell this.
[5850.35s -> 5852.41s]  Actually, we still have potion merchant.
[5855.40s -> 5855.80s]  All right.
[5855.80s -> 5856.68s]  That's pretty fucking good.
[5856.68s -> 5857.40s]  Actually, I'm going to eat it.
[5864.32s -> 5864.56s]  All right.
[5864.56s -> 5865.92s]  I got I just clicked the thing.
[5865.92s -> 5866.56s]  So we moving.
[5868.12s -> 5871.88s]  Uh, I'm grabbing a thing real quick and then we're going to fight the slime god.
[5886.54s -> 5887.42s]  Yeah, okay.
[5887.42s -> 5890.94s]  I wonder how many times and I know it's like completely necessary,
[5890.94s -> 5894.70s]  but I wonder how many times has been said during these two sessions of
[5895.96s -> 5898.04s]  I'm just going to go grab this thing real quick.
[5899.16s -> 5900.28s]  And he's just gone.
[5901.88s -> 5905.56s]  I would have to give you a whole quest to go on to like distract you.
[5905.56s -> 5909.48s]  And I really just need I need 25 of a specific block right now.
[5909.96s -> 5913.96s]  Do you want to walk over here with me and get this block with me, bro?
[5913.96s -> 5918.54s]  Well, you're like 3,500 feet away.
[5919.18s -> 5919.66s]  Exactly.
[5919.66s -> 5920.86s]  You don't want to come do this.
[5921.74s -> 5925.90s]  I'm just going to go get this thing real quick.
[5925.90s -> 5927.50s]  I need a couple of these real quick.
[5928.86s -> 5931.93s]  Oh, I defeated my 200 zombie.
[5931.93s -> 5932.17s]  Cool.
[5934.19s -> 5935.79s]  I'm going to need you over here really fast.
[5937.37s -> 5939.93s]  I need help collecting these ebstone blocks.
[5939.93s -> 5940.33s]  Oh, wait.
[5940.33s -> 5941.93s]  I already have 500.
[5941.93s -> 5943.77s]  Uh, never mind.
[5943.77s -> 5944.41s]  So what's this?
[5944.41s -> 5946.01s]  What's the slime gods?
[5947.31s -> 5947.87s]  Move set.
[5948.88s -> 5949.38s]  Hold on.
[5950.24s -> 5954.81s]  Do I dodge left or dodge right?
[5955.77s -> 5956.81s]  You have to dodge both.
[5958.86s -> 5960.30s]  That's the crazy thing.
[5960.30s -> 5962.46s]  This deadly boss mod is going to tell me what to do.
[5963.18s -> 5980.59s]  And we got like a cricket sound effect.
[5982.35s -> 5984.03s]  I'm dealing with a lot in my life.
[5984.03s -> 5984.75s]  Okay.
[5984.75s -> 5985.87s]  You show no respect.
[5986.43s -> 5987.95s]  I give you a lot of space.
[5987.95s -> 5989.23s]  No, I'm talking about like no.
[5989.23s -> 5989.55s]  Wow.
[5989.55s -> 5989.95s]  Okay.
[5989.95s -> 5991.71s]  That's you had something to say.
[5991.71s -> 5997.71s]  I'm talking about like I'm I'm outside right now and it's like it's quiet.
[5997.71s -> 5998.75s]  Oh, boy.
[5998.75s -> 6000.67s]  That was like that was a loaded cannon.
[6000.67s -> 6001.63s]  Just ready to blow.
[6002.35s -> 6002.75s]  I'm sorry.
[6002.75s -> 6003.71s]  You don't even know.
[6006.92s -> 6007.48s]  Okay, German.
[6007.48s -> 6008.60s]  This is going to be a hard fight.
[6008.60s -> 6009.56s]  Deep issues.
[6010.52s -> 6010.76s]  All right.
[6010.76s -> 6011.48s]  Hard fight.
[6011.48s -> 6014.60s]  If you if you do have any potions or like a buff.
[6015.32s -> 6016.52s]  I just took my bacon buff.
[6018.78s -> 6021.26s]  A potion I threw to you increases mana regen.
[6021.82s -> 6022.32s]  Yeah.
[6024.65s -> 6025.77s]  Take seven minute duration.
[6027.26s -> 6027.58s]  All right.
[6027.58s -> 6028.06s]  I took it.
[6028.62s -> 6030.20s]  Is it going to be tough you said?
[6033.16s -> 6033.66s]  Yeah.
[6035.10s -> 6039.98s]  If you run too far away from you, they like run at you really fast and like slam you hard.
[6039.98s -> 6044.86s]  So you got to focus more on dodging rather than running dodging slime blobs that are
[6044.86s -> 6046.70s]  going to bounce at you and try and jump on you.
[6046.70s -> 6047.18s]  Right.
[6047.18s -> 6052.05s]  While one like slime orb comes after you.
[6052.05s -> 6053.33s]  So dodging is more important.
[6053.33s -> 6055.25s]  It's just a lot of shit on the screen.
[6055.25s -> 6057.65s]  We need to kill the big blobs as quickly as we can.
[6057.65s -> 6059.33s]  Big blob as quick as possible.
[6059.97s -> 6061.81s]  Okay, I'm ready to give it a try.
[6062.45s -> 6065.57s]  Where do they spy?
[6066.37s -> 6073.25s]  Usually we you like, oh, let's build like a platform to fight them.
[6073.25s -> 6076.45s]  Or just now most bosses we're just doing right here.
[6076.45s -> 6076.95s]  Okay.
[6082.40s -> 6083.52s]  So focus on dodging.
[6083.52s -> 6084.72s]  Dodging is more important than.
[6085.36s -> 6086.16s]  Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[6086.16s -> 6087.20s]  Wow, that's so weird.
[6087.20s -> 6088.24s]  Don't do that.
[6088.24s -> 6088.56s]  I know.
[6088.56s -> 6089.36s]  I was just curious.
[6089.36s -> 6090.16s]  Wait, what?
[6090.16s -> 6091.28s]  Because you did it second.
[6091.28s -> 6094.56s]  Now we have I don't understand why it's like overriding our centuries.
[6094.56s -> 6095.44s]  So you have to do that.
[6095.44s -> 6096.32s]  Just leave them here then.
[6096.32s -> 6097.44s]  Just don't even spawn another one.
[6098.08s -> 6098.56s]  Right.
[6098.56s -> 6099.68s]  I need to touch the table.
[6100.56s -> 6106.13s]  Make sure you use your apple.
[6107.01s -> 6107.97s]  I have a burger.
[6108.61s -> 6111.68s]  I've got bacon already.
[6111.68s -> 6112.08s]  I'm ready.
[6112.72s -> 6114.54s]  Where's he at?
[6116.59s -> 6118.43s]  Okay, so you have to dodge that one.
[6118.43s -> 6120.03s]  Don't worry about destroying that one.
[6120.03s -> 6120.51s]  The brain.
[6121.39s -> 6123.17s]  Oh, yeah.
[6123.17s -> 6124.29s]  And it confuses you and shit.
[6124.29s -> 6125.57s]  It's really annoying.
[6125.57s -> 6129.63s]  So don't get hit by the brain as you've called it.
[6133.92s -> 6134.72s]  Ouch.
[6134.72s -> 6143.68s]  Ouch.
[6143.68s -> 6144.32s]  Oh, my God.
[6144.32s -> 6145.44s]  I'm not I'm so slow.
[6146.16s -> 6159.84s]  Oh, my God.
[6159.84s -> 6160.64s]  I'm going to fucking.
[6162.08s -> 6163.36s]  Let me climb the rope.
[6164.24s -> 6164.64s]  Don't die.
[6164.64s -> 6165.20s]  Don't just run.
[6165.20s -> 6165.60s]  Just run.
[6165.60s -> 6166.16s]  Just run.
[6166.16s -> 6171.74s]  Oh, God damn it.
[6171.74s -> 6172.38s]  I'm very slow.
[6174.05s -> 6175.41s]  Yeah, we both are.
[6175.41s -> 6176.53s]  It's kind of a problem.
[6177.57s -> 6179.17s]  Because we've never found boots.
[6179.17s -> 6183.33s]  And even though I've gotten like every single NPC in the goddamn game,
[6183.33s -> 6184.61s]  we still never got the cobbler.
[6185.41s -> 6194.08s]  Yeah, I feel like I'm on slash walk right now.
[6195.12s -> 6201.38s]  Yeah, it's kind of you can't you really can't dodge those things
[6201.38s -> 6202.66s]  unless you can move faster.
[6202.66s -> 6207.02s]  I'm assuming there's this.
[6207.02s -> 6210.14s]  I mean, there's the thing I just got that like 10 percent movement speed thing.
[6210.94s -> 6215.42s]  There is also the if you kill the eye of Cthulhu on expert,
[6215.42s -> 6217.10s]  it gives you a dash you can use.
[6218.82s -> 6219.78s]  That's a pain in the ass.
[6219.78s -> 6224.34s]  And I do it accidentally more often than I do it intentionally.
[6224.34s -> 6226.50s]  Should we just stack movement speed to do this
[6227.22s -> 6229.14s]  and forget about any other buff things?
[6230.46s -> 6236.53s]  No, I think there was I thought there was a person in here.
[6236.53s -> 6237.81s]  I'm like, why is there a guy in here?
[6241.60s -> 6242.56s]  Where's the one that I got?
[6244.38s -> 6245.02s]  Not equipment.
[6248.32s -> 6250.16s]  Yeah, there's 10 percent movement speed.
[6250.16s -> 6251.60s]  I think it's going to wear it.
[6251.60s -> 6252.64s]  What would I replace this with?
[6253.36s -> 6255.12s]  The bees thing isn't a lot.
[6255.12s -> 6256.16s]  I mean, it's better than nothing.
[6260.27s -> 6261.87s]  Use the grappling hook to move quickly.
[6269.23s -> 6272.03s]  Yeah, but even then we really need like boots or something.
[6272.75s -> 6276.35s]  I'm going to build rooms and see if the guy shows up.
[6279.87s -> 6282.11s]  When did I pick up a thousand torches?
[6283.60s -> 6290.00s]  Well, I had these for a while or this is this minion damage increase by one.
[6290.56s -> 6292.56s]  It's really not a big deal at all, right?
[6293.44s -> 6294.48s]  Not really.
[6294.48s -> 6296.18s]  I'm just going to wear the anklet then.
[6303.82s -> 6306.38s]  I mean, that's a when the fuck did you like?
[6312.64s -> 6314.64s]  I guess it really is not that big of a difference.
[6314.64s -> 6315.28s]  It kind of is.
[6317.84s -> 6321.68s]  You can craft Hermes boots with calamity mod using 10 silk.
[6323.74s -> 6326.14s]  Now, when you talk to Hermes boots,
[6326.14s -> 6329.42s]  is that like an you talking about an item to make or drop or find?
[6330.06s -> 6330.94s]  Oh, yeah, you can.
[6331.90s -> 6338.19s]  Well, it's like a 10 step program, too, because we have to make a loom.
[6338.91s -> 6339.41s]  Loom?
[6339.95s -> 6341.23s]  I forgot how to do all.
[6341.23s -> 6342.75s]  You know, I need like a cheater mod.
[6344.19s -> 6344.91s]  I need wood.
[6344.91s -> 6346.51s]  Can you just go collect wood?
[6346.51s -> 6348.03s]  Can you go knock down some trees?
[6348.99s -> 6350.70s]  Yeah.
[6350.70s -> 6351.66s]  Yeah, I can.
[6351.66s -> 6353.58s]  Go chop wood, son, please.
[6353.58s -> 6354.30s]  How much do you want?
[6356.35s -> 6357.15s]  Just so much.
[6359.47s -> 6360.75s]  So wait, I need my axe.
[6360.75s -> 6361.87s]  I don't even have an axe.
[6362.67s -> 6363.39s]  Come on, please.
[6364.43s -> 6369.04s]  Wait, is it piggy bank over?
[6369.04s -> 6369.92s]  You can use bombs.
[6370.56s -> 6383.86s]  People tell us to replant the trees.
[6383.86s -> 6384.66s]  And why did you do this?
[6385.38s -> 6390.88s]  Am I making it harder for me to get in my own house?
[6393.22s -> 6395.62s]  Uh, is there even an axe in here?
[6398.86s -> 6400.38s]  Did we throw away all of our axes?
[6402.93s -> 6403.65s]  Maybe.
[6403.65s -> 6404.69s]  I think we may have.
[6404.69s -> 6405.57s]  Doesn't this guy sell them?
[6408.51s -> 6410.19s]  I'm going to buy a copper axe.
[6412.83s -> 6413.33s]  OK.
[6414.03s -> 6414.99s]  Copper axe.
[6419.41s -> 6421.33s]  People are telling me to talk to the guy with the quest.
[6423.44s -> 6424.24s]  Fighting the heat.
[6425.04s -> 6429.62s]  We're in Egypt when he told me about this artifact and it was very hot there.
[6430.18s -> 6431.60s]  Some kind of ice crystal.
[6432.40s -> 6434.78s]  Some kind of ice crystal that can cool things.
[6435.58s -> 6439.74s]  I thought it would be awesome if I could cool down by using it when it's too hot outside.
[6439.74s -> 6443.58s]  I only know that the different ice creatures contain this crystal inside them.
[6443.58s -> 6444.62s]  Can you please find it?
[6448.06s -> 6448.86s]  OK.
[6448.86s -> 6450.83s]  Find the ice crystal.
[6451.39s -> 6458.10s]  But first, my most important mission is go collect wood for dad.
[6459.97s -> 6462.29s]  That's more important.
[6463.81s -> 6466.13s]  God damn it.
[6466.13s -> 6469.66s]  Jeremy, you're supposed to chop wood.
[6470.54s -> 6471.26s]  And you didn't.
[6472.46s -> 6475.34s]  Me and your mother need one moment alone.
[6481.49s -> 6483.89s]  So do you want like a thousand wood?
[6486.77s -> 6488.69s]  500 would be like art.
[6488.69s -> 6489.41s]  OK.
[6489.41s -> 6490.45s]  I'll just get a thousand.
[6492.99s -> 6494.51s]  And then we're replanting these trees.
[6498.42s -> 6498.74s]  OK.
[6498.74s -> 6501.14s]  I've got us the max storage space.
[6501.14s -> 6502.74s]  We've got we've got a lot of space.
[6502.74s -> 6503.94s]  We're doing good on space.
[6504.90s -> 6506.50s]  How do you replant a tree?
[6507.14s -> 6511.14s]  Just kind of acorn the acorn and you like eat it and you poop it or something.
[6511.94s -> 6523.94s]  Father makes son get a thousand logs.
[6524.66s -> 6530.27s]  And that is it.
[6530.27s -> 6533.87s]  That is at least the second or third like peepee poo poo joke.
[6534.75s -> 6536.03s]  From do you know how old I am?
[6536.67s -> 6537.47s]  I do actually.
[6538.75s -> 6539.38s]  All right.
[6539.38s -> 6541.06s]  You want more than 500.
[6541.70s -> 6554.53s]  Dude, you I am I doing this wrong?
[6556.69s -> 6557.65s]  I'm OK.
[6557.65s -> 6559.01s]  I'm just looking through our storage and
[6559.97s -> 6563.33s]  I'm finding a lot of things I didn't know we had that are really good things
[6563.33s -> 6564.77s]  that I should have known we had.
[6564.77s -> 6565.17s]  Yeah.
[6565.17s -> 6566.05s]  Every once in a while.
[6566.85s -> 6572.08s]  Like there was a bat hook, which is just a better version of the hook you already have.
[6572.08s -> 6572.64s]  Oh, cool.
[6575.04s -> 6577.20s]  There was like a 56 damage sword.
[6578.96s -> 6579.28s]  Nice.
[6581.02s -> 6581.26s]  Yeah.
[6583.33s -> 6585.89s]  Anything else like I should know about in here?
[6585.89s -> 6587.41s]  I told you about the weapon in there and you went.
[6589.58s -> 6590.14s]  Did I?
[6590.14s -> 6591.82s]  Yeah, I said, hey, this is this weapon here.
[6591.82s -> 6592.46s]  It's like cool.
[6592.46s -> 6594.78s]  And you were like, no, not worth it.
[6595.50s -> 6607.68s]  Does that mean trees going to be growing over here?
[6607.68s -> 6609.44s]  Oh, and there's also working.
[6609.44s -> 6611.44s]  You should have a minotaur skull because, you know, there's someone
[6614.93s -> 6616.05s]  that's on the helmet, right?
[6616.05s -> 6616.85s]  OK, yeah, it's not.
[6618.69s -> 6619.33s]  Is it too close?
[6619.97s -> 6622.32s]  You need three blocks in between them.
[6622.32s -> 6627.02s]  OK, just plant trees out here.
[6627.90s -> 6633.02s]  Can I imitate a bop it, please?
[6635.50s -> 6651.04s]  I think I did that like two years ago to get high trees.
[6651.04s -> 6652.88s]  You need three blocks in between the seeds.
[6652.88s -> 6653.20s]  All right.
[6654.00s -> 6657.47s]  I'll just put them every so often, you know.
[6658.11s -> 6658.85s]  All right.
[6658.85s -> 6660.29s]  I'm going to have like a thousand wood here soon.
[6660.85s -> 6671.66s]  I currently have 571.
[6678.66s -> 6680.66s]  No, no, no, no, you don't.
[6680.66s -> 6682.26s]  I plan to torch.
[6683.22s -> 6684.66s]  That's not what I wanted to do.
[6685.38s -> 6709.76s]  Germa terraria, germa terraria, germa terraria with a bunch of pogchamps.
[6710.64s -> 6714.40s]  Pog, pog, pog, pog, pog, pog.
[6714.40s -> 6715.52s]  What's the hardest thing in the whole game?
[6716.40s -> 6717.39s]  All right.
[6717.39s -> 6721.31s]  Well, what's the thing in the game that is so difficult that you have to play perfectly
[6721.31s -> 6724.51s]  and there's still a random chance that you're going to lose no matter what you do?
[6725.23s -> 6730.90s]  The final calamity boss, which I can't call me this or something.
[6732.40s -> 6733.04s]  Cal Midas.
[6733.76s -> 6734.56s]  It's something like that.
[6736.14s -> 6739.10s]  Supreme Calamity Calamity.
[6739.74s -> 6741.02s]  Yeah, that's the one.
[6741.02s -> 6741.74s]  Have you ever beat it?
[6744.13s -> 6747.33s]  My game actually bugged at a certain point in Calamity, so I never got to the end.
[6748.77s -> 6751.49s]  One of the bosses would appear and then run away from me.
[6751.49s -> 6752.61s]  So I just kind of stopped playing.
[6753.57s -> 6754.53s]  Time to operate.
[6755.17s -> 6756.13s]  I forgot about that.
[6757.25s -> 6759.09s]  Sorry, we're just talking about like funny jokes in the stream.
[6759.09s -> 6759.65s]  You know what I mean?
[6759.65s -> 6761.49s]  Oh, yeah, I understand.
[6761.49s -> 6762.05s]  Funny jokes.
[6763.97s -> 6776.16s]  It was like a storm wraith worm that you absolutely 100% need to continue progression.
[6777.54s -> 6778.98s]  Just would run away.
[6779.78s -> 6780.86s]  For a second.
[6780.86s -> 6781.82s]  I thought that was said.
[6781.82s -> 6783.98s]  Germa has cut down his 50th tree or something.
[6783.98s -> 6795.23s]  I was like, well, did 50th slime.
[6795.23s -> 6797.23s]  I feel like I've killed way more than 50 slimes.
[6798.59s -> 6800.75s]  They just accidentally get in the way and you just chop through them.
[6805.98s -> 6807.34s]  How long does it take for a tree to grow?
[6807.90s -> 6811.60s]  I do.
[6811.60s -> 6812.00s]  I don't know.
[6812.88s -> 6814.24s]  Just just sit there forever.
[6814.88s -> 6815.20s]  Okay.
[6817.07s -> 6818.51s]  That's what chat wants you to do.
[6818.51s -> 6822.35s]  That's been like telling you to plant trees since we started this playthrough.
[6822.35s -> 6824.75s]  So you're going to sit there and you're going to wait until those trees grow.
[6825.39s -> 6826.83s]  Why haven't you planted any trees?
[6828.40s -> 6830.32s]  Because it's a waste of time.
[6830.32s -> 6830.56s]  What?
[6831.36s -> 6833.90s]  What do you mean it's a waste of time?
[6838.13s -> 6839.25s]  Why am I doing this thing?
[6839.25s -> 6842.05s]  If you just walked it to your right, there's more trees.
[6854.51s -> 6857.15s]  There's some more trees over there.
[6860.45s -> 6861.17s]  Okay.
[6861.17s -> 6864.83s]  Well, I'm coming back with 833 wood.
[6864.83s -> 6865.55s]  Is that enough for you?
[6866.27s -> 6867.95s]  That is more than enough.
[6867.95s -> 6869.31s]  We'll probably never get through that.
[6869.31s -> 6871.23s]  So all the trees you planted kind of pointless.
[6872.43s -> 6873.95s]  Just throwing it out there.
[6875.07s -> 6876.35s]  Well, it was good to know.
[6876.99s -> 6877.31s]  Yeah.
[6877.31s -> 6878.51s]  I mean, it was, you know, learned.
[6878.51s -> 6879.31s]  You learned next week.
[6879.31s -> 6879.87s]  I'll remind you.
[6883.73s -> 6884.21s]  Here you go.
[6884.77s -> 6888.46s]  Dickhead.
[6888.46s -> 6892.34s]  Go get it.
[6894.18s -> 6894.58s]  I'm sorry.
[6894.58s -> 6894.90s]  I'll get it.
[6894.90s -> 6895.22s]  I'm sorry.
[6895.22s -> 6895.78s]  I'll go get that.
[6895.78s -> 6896.02s]  I'm sorry.
[6896.02s -> 6896.66s]  That was my fault.
[6898.24s -> 6898.72s]  Wow.
[6899.36s -> 6900.00s]  Wow.
[6900.00s -> 6901.28s]  Germa uncensored.
[6901.28s -> 6901.84s]  Ha ha.
[6901.84s -> 6902.40s]  Oh God.
[6906.46s -> 6907.26s]  You want this or not?
[6908.00s -> 6908.40s]  I do.
[6908.96s -> 6913.58s]  I forget why I want it.
[6913.58s -> 6914.62s]  Why did we need it?
[6914.62s -> 6915.02s]  I don't know.
[6915.02s -> 6916.46s]  You just maybe go do that.
[6916.46s -> 6918.54s]  You said when I need 500, we'll do it.
[6919.42s -> 6920.14s]  500.
[6920.14s -> 6920.78s]  We'll do it.
[6920.78s -> 6921.98s]  Was that a punishment?
[6921.98s -> 6924.62s]  Like father, son, you go chop wood.
[6924.62s -> 6926.54s]  And I don't remember why I wanted it.
[6926.54s -> 6929.02s]  Was that just you just punishing me?
[6929.02s -> 6933.17s]  No, I like actually needed it, but I don't know why.
[6934.13s -> 6935.76s]  Oh my God.
[6938.08s -> 6939.28s]  The loom for the loom.
[6939.28s -> 6939.68s]  The loom.
[6939.68s -> 6940.16s]  The loom.
[6941.12s -> 6949.55s]  Are you building a loom right now or have you DCed?
[6952.34s -> 6953.14s]  Loom for the boots.
[6953.94s -> 6954.50s]  He muted.
[6955.14s -> 6959.82s]  Germa uncensored.
[6959.82s -> 6960.30s]  Ha ha.
[6960.30s -> 6960.94s]  Oh God.
[6964.91s -> 6970.67s]  Look, it was like a different time back in 2012.
[6971.63s -> 6975.36s]  Titles, I didn't even like, nobody even knew what to do.
[6980.05s -> 6980.61s]  Nobody.
[6982.50s -> 6989.62s]  Your titles in like 2011, 2012 were not like cool, like ironic, funny titles.
[6990.74s -> 6991.54s]  You can just forget about that.
[6991.54s -> 6992.10s]  Come over here.
[6993.14s -> 6995.62s]  Can you talk to Popo while I talk to Popo?
[6995.62s -> 6996.74s]  Is that a thing?
[6996.74s -> 6997.46s]  Yes.
[6997.46s -> 7000.10s]  So he sells potions.
[7000.10s -> 7000.90s]  He's our guy.
[7000.90s -> 7003.62s]  Before we fight a boss, he's our freaking guy.
[7003.62s -> 7009.86s]  Okay, so vanilla potions gives you an extra summon, health regeneration, extra defense.
[7009.86s -> 7010.90s]  He is our guy.
[7012.02s -> 7013.86s]  There's actually one button, I forget what it is.
[7013.86s -> 7016.02s]  Someone probably knows.
[7016.02s -> 7019.78s]  You press one button, it drinks all the unique potions you have in your whole inventory.
[7019.78s -> 7020.10s]  Really?
[7023.55s -> 7024.03s]  B.
[7024.03s -> 7025.47s]  Yeah, so don't accidentally press B.
[7025.47s -> 7026.19s]  Don't press B.
[7028.24s -> 7029.60s]  Until you need to press B.
[7032.05s -> 7033.49s]  Let's you move swiftly in liquid.
[7034.21s -> 7035.02s]  Okay.
[7039.73s -> 7042.29s]  Oh, also take, here, take this.
[7042.29s -> 7043.57s]  I'm giving you a skull.
[7043.57s -> 7045.01s]  I'm currently trying to process.
[7045.01s -> 7046.93s]  Well, it's a very important item that I got.
[7046.93s -> 7048.13s]  I got it for you.
[7049.09s -> 7054.43s]  You just, I'm like, I just turned 21 and you brought me into the fucking bar.
[7054.43s -> 7056.03s]  And you're like, hey, what do you want?
[7056.03s -> 7058.75s]  It's like, I, what even is rum?
[7058.75s -> 7060.51s]  What the fuck does vodka taste like?
[7060.51s -> 7061.31s]  I don't know.
[7061.31s -> 7062.19s]  Hold on a second.
[7062.83s -> 7064.93s]  Iron skin.
[7067.90s -> 7069.34s]  Oh, you get iron skin.
[7071.34s -> 7071.82s]  I'm trying.
[7072.54s -> 7077.78s]  Increases D.
[7077.78s -> 7078.50s]  That's a lot.
[7078.50s -> 7078.74s]  Yeah.
[7079.38s -> 7081.71s]  Do I not have any money?
[7081.71s -> 7082.59s]  Where's all my money?
[7083.31s -> 7084.42s]  What did you say?
[7084.42s -> 7084.66s]  Okay.
[7085.30s -> 7086.90s]  Fleeting Minotaur skull.
[7087.46s -> 7088.90s]  Here's some money.
[7088.90s -> 7091.66s]  Increases your max number of minions by one.
[7091.66s -> 7093.58s]  Decreases non-minion damage by 10%.
[7094.46s -> 7095.66s]  Is this a helmet?
[7096.70s -> 7098.06s]  It's an accessory.
[7098.06s -> 7099.82s]  Yes, but this is, this is a skull.
[7099.82s -> 7100.70s]  No drama.
[7100.70s -> 7102.78s]  No, that's a skull.
[7102.78s -> 7103.98s]  We had the same conversation.
[7103.98s -> 7105.10s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[7105.10s -> 7107.02s]  A heart is like as big as your fist.
[7107.02s -> 7111.36s]  A Minotaur skull is like a huge fucking skull hollowed out.
[7111.36s -> 7113.04s]  We've had this conversation before.
[7113.04s -> 7113.60s]  No, no, no.
[7113.60s -> 7115.20s]  I'm not going to have it again with you.
[7115.20s -> 7116.72s]  I refuse to accept that one.
[7117.44s -> 7119.47s]  So what do I replace then?
[7121.50s -> 7122.46s]  This one's 20 mana.
[7122.46s -> 7122.94s]  That's pretty good.
[7126.06s -> 7129.34s]  A Minotaur skull would like, it would be too big.
[7131.18s -> 7132.46s]  Yeah, real life Minotaur.
[7135.18s -> 7135.50s]  Hello.
[7142.37s -> 7144.69s]  Get rid of the B, but it's plus four defense.
[7144.69s -> 7145.25s]  That's a lot.
[7149.46s -> 7150.34s]  Is plus four D.
[7150.34s -> 7151.46s]  That's a lot of defense, right?
[7154.45s -> 7156.00s]  It's okay.
[7156.00s -> 7157.92s]  So I wouldn't want to replace that.
[7157.92s -> 7159.76s]  What about the 20, maybe the 20 mana?
[7160.32s -> 7162.06s]  What is 20?
[7162.06s -> 7163.26s]  Yeah, get that out of here.
[7163.26s -> 7170.11s]  It's not, I mean, slowly generate life, but that's another minion.
[7170.11s -> 7173.39s]  And I can't just put it on.
[7176.05s -> 7176.29s]  Yeah.
[7176.29s -> 7178.37s]  Now I can have like five of these fucking things.
[7179.25s -> 7180.61s]  Get rid of the crappy anklet.
[7181.97s -> 7185.81s]  I remember why we needed wood, but I think it's good.
[7188.77s -> 7189.09s]  Okay.
[7190.34s -> 7191.14s]  Crappy anklet.
[7191.14s -> 7191.78s]  This is good.
[7195.18s -> 7196.70s]  Well, this is, okay, you, there's a,
[7196.70s -> 7198.30s]  why do I have candy cane blocks here?
[7200.30s -> 7201.42s]  Isn't that what you wanted?
[7205.71s -> 7207.31s]  Do we need any blood drop, green slime?
[7207.31s -> 7209.07s]  But I'm just saying literally everything I have.
[7210.19s -> 7211.31s]  Just dump it.
[7211.31s -> 7212.27s]  This person's name.
[7214.43s -> 7220.61s]  I just got five community subs from somebody named Jerma sucks.
[7223.17s -> 7226.61s]  It's like capital J and capital S, just Jerma sucks.
[7227.33s -> 7229.01s]  S-U-C-K-S.
[7229.01s -> 7229.49s]  My man.
[7239.81s -> 7241.89s]  Well, thank you, by the way.
[7241.89s -> 7248.94s]  How do I make a loom?
[7248.94s -> 7249.66s]  A sawmill?
[7250.38s -> 7251.26s]  37 gold.
[7252.40s -> 7253.20s]  What am I doing?
[7253.84s -> 7254.16s]  All right.
[7254.16s -> 7255.04s]  You wanted me to buy.
[7255.92s -> 7257.81s]  Okay.
[7257.81s -> 7260.21s]  I'm going to buy man of a generation potion.
[7261.09s -> 7261.33s]  Right?
[7261.89s -> 7264.45s]  I already did it, so you can't tell me no.
[7265.33s -> 7265.97s]  Iron skin.
[7265.97s -> 7267.41s]  Should I buy like a few of each of these?
[7268.13s -> 7269.81s]  Yeah, because you're going to keep using them.
[7271.38s -> 7272.34s]  Iron chain.
[7272.34s -> 7272.74s]  That's right.
[7272.74s -> 7275.86s]  That's the stupid random thing that you need to make the one time.
[7275.86s -> 7278.02s]  It makes, oh, let's make 10 chains.
[7278.02s -> 7280.42s]  Like I'm not destroying the environment by doing this.
[7280.42s -> 7282.18s]  I only need one, but I'll buy 10.
[7282.82s -> 7285.89s]  Thanks for selling it in a pack.
[7285.89s -> 7287.33s]  Obsidian skin potion.
[7288.37s -> 7289.09s]  Light regen.
[7289.97s -> 7290.29s]  Yeah.
[7291.65s -> 7295.25s]  And then shine.
[7295.25s -> 7296.98s]  Marmo light in the abyss.
[7296.98s -> 7297.54s]  What's that mean?
[7298.91s -> 7300.03s]  Ah, don't worry about that.
[7300.67s -> 7301.65s]  Oh, spelunker.
[7302.37s -> 7303.09s]  These are expensive.
[7305.34s -> 7306.06s]  Do we need these anymore?
[7306.06s -> 7307.26s]  We don't need spelunkers anymore, do we?
[7308.91s -> 7309.95s]  We will always need them.
[7311.47s -> 7315.28s]  Well, this seems insanely important.
[7315.28s -> 7316.40s]  I'm going to get like 10 of these.
[7317.36s -> 7318.72s]  Max number of minions.
[7318.72s -> 7320.24s]  Top row is up there.
[7320.24s -> 7321.76s]  Okay, that looks like a sawmill.
[7328.46s -> 7329.82s]  Am I spending all of our money?
[7330.46s -> 7332.14s]  You're spending a lot of it.
[7332.14s -> 7332.70s]  It's fine.
[7332.70s -> 7335.02s]  We had like 40 gold when it's gone.
[7335.90s -> 7338.14s]  I mean, just go through all my expenses.
[7338.14s -> 7339.02s]  What's the big deal?
[7343.44s -> 7344.56s]  It's all gone.
[7344.56s -> 7346.00s]  I used 40 gold.
[7349.33s -> 7351.01s]  This is why you have to like get it.
[7351.01s -> 7352.85s]  You have to like get a different box from me.
[7353.81s -> 7354.93s]  You just make, all right.
[7354.93s -> 7356.29s]  Listen, let me tell you something.
[7356.29s -> 7357.89s]  Let me get, this is a strategy we're going to use.
[7358.45s -> 7362.13s]  Make me a separate box for me to put my stuff in.
[7362.13s -> 7363.33s]  And then you can just go in there.
[7363.33s -> 7366.61s]  Too many of them might crash or cause problems in multiplayer.
[7366.61s -> 7368.13s]  Oh, all right, never mind.
[7368.13s -> 7370.72s]  So I'd rather just have it all in one spot.
[7371.44s -> 7373.84s]  And even then, I think it was making too many slots
[7373.84s -> 7376.24s]  might be a problem, but I don't know.
[7376.24s -> 7376.64s]  Okay.
[7376.64s -> 7380.11s]  Well, I'm going to, I don't want to press B on some of these.
[7380.99s -> 7382.88s]  Yeah, you have cobweb.
[7382.88s -> 7385.36s]  You must have like a million cobweb.
[7385.36s -> 7387.60s]  I probably have put like hundreds of it in here.
[7387.60s -> 7388.64s]  Is it in your ammo?
[7388.64s -> 7389.68s]  Sometimes it goes there.
[7392.40s -> 7395.92s]  Uh, no, I have snow, I have 12 snowballs.
[7396.48s -> 7398.10s]  I swear to God, I had cobweb.
[7398.10s -> 7399.06s]  Did you already take it out of here?
[7400.32s -> 7402.29s]  Yeah.
[7402.29s -> 7403.57s]  Upgrade your copper axe.
[7403.57s -> 7405.17s]  No, I just, all right.
[7405.17s -> 7406.21s]  I want this, whatever it is.
[7406.21s -> 7407.41s]  What is this?
[7407.41s -> 7409.81s]  Because that is, I want like the fucking popsicle.
[7411.42s -> 7413.34s]  Is it, can you get, is there one that exists in this game
[7413.34s -> 7414.54s]  that has blue as well?
[7415.10s -> 7416.46s]  You know, like the rocket popsicles.
[7417.02s -> 7418.77s]  What are you talking about?
[7418.77s -> 7419.27s]  What?
[7421.36s -> 7424.00s]  Damn.
[7424.00s -> 7426.16s]  Oh my God, I forgot about auto houses.
[7428.42s -> 7430.51s]  My God.
[7430.51s -> 7431.63s]  Kind of irrelevant now.
[7431.63s -> 7433.31s]  Why are there two Minotaur skulls in here?
[7433.95s -> 7437.22s]  Because I had more than one.
[7437.22s -> 7439.38s]  Uh, I think later on you can combine them with some stuff.
[7440.02s -> 7442.77s]  Let me see how many of these I can have.
[7442.77s -> 7446.62s]  Oh man, that's insane.
[7446.62s -> 7448.14s]  Five of these things just flying around.
[7448.70s -> 7450.54s]  Five of these things in two of these centuries.
[7451.58s -> 7458.94s]  So you, can you stack the skulls?
[7461.87s -> 7462.99s]  I don't think so.
[7462.99s -> 7463.63s]  Are you sure?
[7463.63s -> 7464.03s]  Can you?
[7465.07s -> 7467.63s]  I mean, I don't see why not.
[7469.04s -> 7472.29s]  Um, huh, well.
[7473.01s -> 7475.22s]  I've never thought about that.
[7475.22s -> 7476.02s]  No, you can't.
[7476.02s -> 7477.38s]  No, they're unique.
[7478.18s -> 7484.61s]  Oh well.
[7484.61s -> 7490.03s]  All right, so I'm going to, I've got,
[7490.03s -> 7492.03s]  I'm pretty much ready to do whatever you want to do.
[7492.91s -> 7495.74s]  I just need to go get one thing real quick.
[7497.52s -> 7498.16s]  Sure you do.
[7499.12s -> 7500.56s]  I'm sure you do.
[7500.56s -> 7502.40s]  If we want to fight the slime god again,
[7502.40s -> 7505.44s]  and I personally, that's what I want to do.
[7505.44s -> 7506.80s]  You want to fight slime god again?
[7506.80s -> 7507.36s]  Okay.
[7507.36s -> 7508.72s]  We need more blighted gel.
[7509.76s -> 7514.54s]  Hey Jeremy, can you give a shout out to my cat by going pss pss pss?
[7514.54s -> 7515.04s]  Yeah.
[7515.52s -> 7517.65s]  Pss pss pss pss.
[7517.65s -> 7518.85s]  All right, so I'm going to go get that.
[7519.41s -> 7521.33s]  All right, you're going to go get something real quick?
[7521.33s -> 7521.73s]  Yep.
[7521.73s -> 7522.69s]  I'm going to go get something to eat.
[7527.16s -> 7528.52s]  Combine, wait, there was a, there was a,
[7528.52s -> 7529.80s]  there was an advice Jupiter.
[7530.52s -> 7533.56s]  Combine the minotaur skull with your necromancer's heart.
[7536.28s -> 7539.64s]  Um, no, I think you also need a soul stone.
[7539.64s -> 7541.64s]  Hold on, wait, what do you mean?
[7543.04s -> 7544.88s]  You might also need a soul stone to make what he's doing.
[7544.88s -> 7546.40s]  I talked to a craft guy.
[7546.40s -> 7547.04s]  It's Jeffrey, right?
[7547.04s -> 7550.82s]  Remember, am I muted or am I talking to you?
[7551.54s -> 7552.58s]  His name's Jeffrey, right?
[7553.14s -> 7553.86s]  I don't remember.
[7553.86s -> 7554.58s]  Ah, sorry.
[7555.14s -> 7559.44s]  Wait, I put the minotaur skull on the crafting thing.
[7559.44s -> 7561.04s]  Okay, I need a soul stone.
[7561.84s -> 7562.85s]  What is that?
[7563.41s -> 7566.05s]  10% increase minion damage, increase your mach number of minions,
[7566.05s -> 7567.49s]  increase your mach number of sentries.
[7568.37s -> 7573.01s]  Taking fatal damage will instead return you to 20 life every five minutes.
[7573.01s -> 7574.13s]  Where do we get a soul stone?
[7577.27s -> 7579.99s]  Uh, we need a mana bauble and blood.
[7580.95s -> 7582.47s]  I think we might have one of those.
[7582.47s -> 7584.07s]  Uh, search for mana bauble.
[7585.38s -> 7586.18s]  Mana bauble?
[7587.14s -> 7587.64s]  Yeah.
[7588.10s -> 7594.16s]  Oh, mana bauble you could just make with 15 arcane dust.
[7594.16s -> 7597.60s]  But the thing we don't have is the goblin to combine trinkets,
[7597.60s -> 7599.36s]  so we can't actually do that yet.
[7599.36s -> 7599.86s]  What?
[7601.27s -> 7603.03s]  We have to find the goblin guy.
[7603.03s -> 7606.63s]  Sometimes he's in the dungeon, like, bound,
[7606.63s -> 7609.67s]  or he's underground, like, tied up, and you need to rescue him.
[7610.47s -> 7615.09s]  And he's really important.
[7615.09s -> 7616.37s]  Just make the mana bauble?
[7617.67s -> 7618.39s]  Yeah, you could.
[7619.03s -> 7621.65s]  You might as well do that now.
[7621.65s -> 7623.57s]  So what does it take to do to make a mana bauble?
[7623.57s -> 7624.85s]  What does it have to put in there?
[7625.49s -> 7629.17s]  15 arcane dust, which is you can make from fallen stars.
[7629.17s -> 7629.65s]  Oh, okay.
[7629.65s -> 7631.49s]  I have 10 fallen stars on me right now,
[7631.49s -> 7633.81s]  so I can basically make it when I come back.
[7634.55s -> 7637.19s]  I don't think we have any fallen stars.
[7637.19s -> 7639.43s]  Hey, I have 10 fallen stars on me right now,
[7639.43s -> 7640.79s]  so I can make it when I come back.
[7640.79s -> 7643.19s]  Yeah, but I wanted to do something because I'm useless.
[7644.34s -> 7645.86s]  I'm just like the guy standing.
[7645.86s -> 7647.78s]  I'm like an NPC in your house.
[7647.78s -> 7650.34s]  Well, do some research.
[7650.34s -> 7651.46s]  You gotta let me fly.
[7651.46s -> 7653.76s]  You gotta let me fly.
[7653.76s -> 7655.92s]  Try and find the goblin guy.
[7655.92s -> 7663.16s]  Get some cobwebs.
[7663.16s -> 7668.07s]  I'm gonna go cobweb hunting.
[7668.31s -> 7671.00s]  Let's kill spiders, I'm assuming, right?
[7671.00s -> 7673.96s]  I already forget why I needed the silk in the first place.
[7675.51s -> 7677.43s]  Tori is like, that's like, okay, I need a loom.
[7677.43s -> 7678.07s]  I should do this.
[7678.07s -> 7679.75s]  I need to get, I need a sawmill.
[7679.75s -> 7680.71s]  Okay, now I've got this.
[7680.71s -> 7681.91s]  I need cobweb to make...
[7681.91s -> 7683.27s]  Why do I need silk for?
[7684.13s -> 7686.05s]  Oh, for boots to make boots.
[7686.05s -> 7686.69s]  Okay.
[7686.69s -> 7688.77s]  You need to cut a hundred, a thousand wood.
[7688.77s -> 7693.51s]  I need to cut a thousand trees down to summon the goblin.
[7693.51s -> 7693.91s]  Sure.
[7693.91s -> 7695.35s]  Son, go get some cobweb.
[7697.00s -> 7698.44s]  All right. Cobweb comes with spiders.
[7698.44s -> 7700.44s]  Spiders come from underground.
[7700.44s -> 7701.80s]  We can fight the god again.
[7702.68s -> 7703.88s]  All right.
[7703.88s -> 7705.64s]  Or do you want to get the boots first?
[7705.64s -> 7707.57s]  Um, let's, let's try it again.
[7707.57s -> 7708.45s]  Let's fight.
[7708.45s -> 7709.25s]  Let's win.
[7709.25s -> 7710.63s]  I've got extra minions.
[7710.63s -> 7711.35s]  Wait, this is cobweb.
[7711.35s -> 7713.11s]  Barry the cob, the cobbler!
[7713.11s -> 7713.83s]  Cobbler!
[7713.83s -> 7715.17s]  There he is, right?
[7715.17s -> 7715.89s]  Where is he?
[7715.89s -> 7717.65s]  He's, I don't know, find him.
[7717.65s -> 7720.76s]  The kick your ass.
[7720.76s -> 7721.40s]  Is he in there?
[7721.40s -> 7723.40s]  Is he in there to kick your ass?
[7723.40s -> 7728.53s]  Oh, he's on the roof.
[7728.53s -> 7729.41s]  Is that him?
[7729.41s -> 7730.45s]  Yeah, that's him.
[7730.45s -> 7734.84s]  I don't think he sells the specific thing we need, though.
[7734.84s -> 7740.20s]  But he does have boots that help you run.
[7740.20s -> 7740.92s]  Whoa.
[7740.92s -> 7741.64s]  What is this stuff?
[7741.64s -> 7742.36s]  Okay, hold on.
[7742.36s -> 7744.20s]  Too bad I spent all, we don't have any money.
[7744.20s -> 7748.04s]  Healthy boots.
[7748.04s -> 7749.65s]  Oh, no, he does sell Hermes boots.
[7753.33s -> 7754.77s]  I think he spent all our money.
[7757.17s -> 7758.45s]  Five gold for Hermes boots,
[7758.45s -> 7760.37s]  or we can just like gather cobweb.
[7760.37s -> 7761.65s]  I am gathering nothing.
[7763.09s -> 7763.73s]  Find a pig.
[7763.73s -> 7764.93s]  We have 28 gold in the story.
[7764.93s -> 7774.24s]  American runs super fast.
[7774.24s -> 7776.87s]  Damaging drops from below your boots.
[7776.87s -> 7778.39s]  So Hermes boots are just,
[7778.39s -> 7781.51s]  you just put them on and never take them off.
[7781.51s -> 7783.11s]  You'll take them off eventually, but.
[7783.11s -> 7788.34s]  And also I'm pretty sure we have the stuff
[7788.34s -> 7790.66s]  to combine with Hermes boots to make lightning boots.
[7790.66s -> 7791.46s]  Let me check on that.
[7792.18s -> 7800.04s]  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[7800.04s -> 7802.36s]  Oh, we need the fucking goblin.
[7802.36s -> 7804.28s]  Everything, everything.
[7806.20s -> 7809.64s]  We need rocket boots and the goblin sells rocket boots.
[7811.62s -> 7814.02s]  And yeah, and we couldn't combine without the tinker anyway.
[7814.02s -> 7814.98s]  God damn it, dude.
[7815.78s -> 7818.20s]  All right, well, let's just kill this guy.
[7818.20s -> 7819.24s]  We have like our soup.
[7819.24s -> 7820.68s]  Press B before we go.
[7820.68s -> 7821.32s]  Let's kill.
[7821.32s -> 7822.52s]  We have upgraded our health.
[7823.40s -> 7824.20s]  Last time we fought this guy,
[7824.20s -> 7825.48s]  didn't we only have like 200 health?
[7826.36s -> 7829.19s]  Or would that, am I making that up?
[7829.75s -> 7830.55s]  You're making that up.
[7837.06s -> 7838.02s]  But we didn't have potions.
[7838.02s -> 7839.06s]  We can beat them with potions.
[7843.41s -> 7844.29s]  You ready?
[7844.29s -> 7844.77s]  All right, hold on.
[7845.89s -> 7846.93s]  Am I about to press B?
[7846.93s -> 7847.97s]  You take everything, right?
[7849.83s -> 7850.33s]  Yeah.
[7852.84s -> 7854.20s]  All right, I'm gonna, I'm gonna put,
[7854.20s -> 7855.80s]  you know, put your sentry down first.
[7856.52s -> 7857.48s]  Did you put one down?
[7858.36s -> 7858.86s]  Yeah.
[7859.32s -> 7860.63s]  Okay.
[7861.09s -> 7862.45s]  Pressing B for potions now.
[7863.17s -> 7864.37s]  Holy fuck, that's a lot.
[7864.37s -> 7865.41s]  And I gotta eat a hamburger.
[7868.10s -> 7868.82s]  All right, I'm ready.
[7870.50s -> 7871.30s]  I don't have the thing.
[7871.94s -> 7872.44s]  Oh!
[7876.50s -> 7877.00s]  Piggy!
[7879.22s -> 7881.30s]  We only have four minutes of these potions.
[7881.30s -> 7881.80s]  What did you do?
[7881.80s -> 7882.82s]  I need ebstone blocks.
[7882.82s -> 7883.32s]  What?
[7885.08s -> 7886.24s]  What is it?
[7886.24s -> 7886.74s]  Ebstone block.
[7887.68s -> 7888.56s]  What do you mean?
[7888.56s -> 7889.60s]  Do I have any?
[7889.60s -> 7890.32s]  I've got boots.
[7890.32s -> 7891.36s]  I'll be quick.
[7891.36s -> 7892.64s]  Gonna do something real quick.
[7893.44s -> 7897.00s]  Oh, by the way, that was probably like,
[7897.00s -> 7898.84s]  that was probably like nine gold.
[7898.84s -> 7900.68s]  I'm gonna get killed, kill Piggy.
[7900.68s -> 7902.12s]  They, it lasts for like seven minutes.
[7902.12s -> 7902.62s]  I'll be back.
[7902.62s -> 7903.64s]  No, it doesn't. It lasts for four.
[7904.44s -> 7906.74s]  I'll be, dude, it's gonna take like two seconds.
[7907.46s -> 7911.59s]  Like I'm already done.
[7911.59s -> 7912.79s]  Like I already have it.
[7913.43s -> 7914.15s]  I'm killing the pig.
[7915.62s -> 7917.06s]  Okay, you're putting it to use.
[7918.93s -> 7921.33s]  Good thing I took all these potions to get 500 of them.
[7921.33s -> 7923.25s]  Yeah, and I turned them all into blocks.
[7923.25s -> 7926.05s]  I need ebstone brick, like the raw form of it.
[7927.46s -> 7929.70s]  I forgot why I went and got them, I think.
[7930.42s -> 7930.92s]  Oh wait, no.
[7932.02s -> 7932.74s]  It's the whole thing.
[7932.74s -> 7937.97s]  You know what? Just, just forget about me.
[7938.61s -> 7940.61s]  Forget about me.
[7952.26s -> 7953.94s]  You'd be happier if you didn't even know me.
[7954.74s -> 7957.54s]  At least the sentries are still up there.
[7957.54s -> 7959.09s]  Forget about me.
[7960.39s -> 7961.19s]  Okay, I'm ready.
[7961.19s -> 7962.39s]  Did we take enough potions again?
[7963.35s -> 7963.85s]  No.
[7964.15s -> 7965.51s]  No, they last four minutes.
[7965.51s -> 7966.01s]  Okay.
[7971.56s -> 7973.08s]  Oh my god, I have a gravity potion.
[7973.08s -> 7974.76s]  It ate my fucking gravity potion.
[7984.69s -> 7985.81s]  Why am I floating around?
[7987.35s -> 7990.23s]  Because you probably also had a featherfall potion like I did.
[7990.23s -> 7990.95s]  No, I don't think I did.
[7991.91s -> 8024.24s]  Stop bouncing around on me.
[8024.24s -> 8024.96s]  God damn it.
[8025.84s -> 8030.55s]  Ow.
[8031.33s -> 8033.33s]  Ow, they're everywhere.
[8033.33s -> 8037.01s]  I'm gonna die.
[8037.73s -> 8047.51s]  Talk to the nurse if you need to.
[8049.72s -> 8050.52s]  I'm dead.
[8050.52s -> 8051.24s]  I got juggled.
[8058.48s -> 8060.00s]  Oh, gravity potion wore off.
[8061.51s -> 8063.43s]  Okay, this is so much harder when I'm not running.
[8070.95s -> 8071.45s]  Oh god.
[8075.60s -> 8077.44s]  Just don't die, just don't die, just don't die.
[8077.44s -> 8078.72s]  It's kind of impossible.
[8078.72s -> 8079.36s]  It's impossible.
[8080.64s -> 8082.24s]  It's impossible for me to not die.
[8085.60s -> 8086.10s]  I'm dead.
[8086.48s -> 8089.14s]  Oh my god.
[8089.14s -> 8090.66s]  I'm just trying to talk to...
[8090.66s -> 8091.46s]  I can't move.
[8096.37s -> 8097.97s]  No, it's still here.
[8097.97s -> 8098.53s]  It's still here.
[8098.53s -> 8102.45s]  We're like this late in the game and I still don't have a weapon I want to use.
[8103.17s -> 8103.89s]  Is it still here?
[8104.77s -> 8105.27s]  No.
[8112.42s -> 8114.18s]  Germany gets all the fucking good items.
[8118.23s -> 8119.99s]  There's something dropped over here though.
[8120.55s -> 8123.09s]  Immunity...
[8123.09s -> 8124.21s]  What is a nazar?
[8130.76s -> 8131.72s]  Ayaya.
[8131.72s -> 8132.44s]  Climb the rope?
[8136.90s -> 8139.48s]  It's harder when you get like hit and you just get juggled.
[8140.20s -> 8143.38s]  What is this thing?
[8144.98s -> 8148.61s]  I have some casualties.
[8154.07s -> 8155.19s]  Make more platforms?
[8157.12s -> 8159.36s]  Yeah, we kind of only have this one platform.
[8160.00s -> 8163.84s]  Should we make like two or three other platforms to fall down to and jump to?
[8164.32s -> 8166.16s]  Fall down and jump up and...
[8166.16s -> 8167.92s]  Because we're really only like one one plane.
[8168.72s -> 8169.22s]  Yeah.
[8169.76s -> 8171.28s]  Okay, do it.
[8172.40s -> 8174.08s]  Was that was all that wood that I bought?
[8174.08s -> 8175.60s]  Yeah, I put it in the storage.
[8176.16s -> 8177.36s]  I'm gonna go get a thing real quick.
[8179.52s -> 8189.80s]  Do we just have platforms?
[8192.45s -> 8194.05s]  The wood just turns into platforms.
[8194.69s -> 8195.41s]  It just does, right?
[8196.13s -> 8203.57s]  How much should I have?
[8203.57s -> 8204.29s]  Like a couple hundred?
[8212.56s -> 8215.60s]  Yeah, so then we can kind of like jump and fall from plan to plan.
[8216.56s -> 8223.04s]  I think Jerma last stream said building these platforms was cheating.
[8225.46s -> 8226.10s]  Did I say that?
[8226.82s -> 8227.70s]  You did.
[8227.70s -> 8232.93s]  I don't remember that.
[8232.93s -> 8234.21s]  Okay, so theoretically...
[8236.95s -> 8237.67s]  How did you make the...
[8238.55s -> 8240.66s]  How did you do like the little...
[8240.66s -> 8242.10s]  It has to be connected to a wall, doesn't it?
[8244.18s -> 8244.68s]  In it?
[8245.14s -> 8248.26s]  Yeah, how did you do this though?
[8248.26s -> 8249.70s]  How did you make like the little staircase?
[8250.42s -> 8252.45s]  How did you like place the stairs?
[8253.25s -> 8255.09s]  I have no idea what you're talking about.
[8255.09s -> 8255.81s]  Oh, there we go.
[8256.53s -> 8265.81s]  All right, so you gotta be like enough to...
[8266.69s -> 8270.79s]  Let's see, like that we can jump.
[8271.11s -> 8271.83s]  Like right here.
[8272.71s -> 8276.68s]  Because if I go like this, right there.
[8293.16s -> 8295.11s]  I can clean that up.
[8295.11s -> 8307.64s]  Okay, yeah, it seems like you can like jump up.
[8307.64s -> 8309.08s]  Like jump up over here and then up.
[8310.04s -> 8310.76s]  There's more...
[8310.76s -> 8311.96s]  Because you just can't get away.
[8311.96s -> 8313.88s]  There's just too many things to like have to dodge.
[8314.52s -> 8315.56s]  They take up the whole space.
[8318.24s -> 8318.80s]  Ralph is here.
[8318.80s -> 8319.30s]  Who's Ralph?
[8319.92s -> 8338.21s]  Okay, I'm gonna like do...
[8338.21s -> 8339.01s]  I'm gonna make like a...
[8339.01s -> 8339.41s]  Hold on.
[8339.41s -> 8341.65s]  I'm gonna do a bigger arena.
[8341.65s -> 8342.21s]  You go get...
[8342.21s -> 8343.49s]  You do a good thing real quick.
[8344.21s -> 8345.76s]  I'm gonna make like some space.
[8345.76s -> 8347.20s]  I got the soul thing for you.
[8347.20s -> 8348.88s]  So when we finally get Goblin Man.
[8349.44s -> 8358.92s]  I need more of these.
[8367.96s -> 8369.40s]  All I do is give.
[8369.40s -> 8371.64s]  All I freaking do is give.
[8372.60s -> 8373.64s]  And what does Jerma do?
[8373.64s -> 8374.60s]  Take, take, take.
[8375.24s -> 8379.56s]  All right, this should be good.
[8380.60s -> 8386.79s]  Let's see if he'll laugh.
[8386.79s -> 8387.92s]  That's all I can do.
[8389.27s -> 8391.51s]  I mean, yeah, because like what are you even talking about?
[8391.51s -> 8392.55s]  I'm doing stuff here.
[8393.43s -> 8395.67s]  All right, I'm thinking...
[8395.67s -> 8396.39s]  Let's do another one.
[8397.03s -> 8400.77s]  We're making an old NES game.
[8401.33s -> 8404.45s]  We're making...
[8404.45s -> 8404.93s]  What's that game?
[8404.93s -> 8406.61s]  That like Burger Town game?
[8406.69s -> 8407.33s]  Burger Time.
[8408.44s -> 8408.76s]  What?
[8417.59s -> 8419.43s]  A goblin army is approaching from the east.
[8420.87s -> 8421.59s]  We're being invaded.
[8422.63s -> 8423.35s]  Oh.
[8423.35s -> 8424.31s]  Goblin army.
[8424.31s -> 8424.47s]  No.
[8429.40s -> 8430.04s]  Is this like bad?
[8430.04s -> 8431.52s]  Do I have to get over there?
[8431.52s -> 8431.92s]  No.
[8431.92s -> 8432.88s]  It's like the blood moon.
[8432.88s -> 8435.46s]  They just keep coming until you kill enough of them.
[8435.46s -> 8435.94s]  And this is...
[8436.66s -> 8437.30s]  We needed this, right?
[8437.30s -> 8438.26s]  Didn't you say we needed this stuff?
[8442.90s -> 8443.38s]  No.
[8443.38s -> 8444.02s]  Okay.
[8446.39s -> 8448.07s]  It's so funny that I can look over there and see.
[8449.54s -> 8450.34s]  Like exactly...
[8450.98s -> 8452.82s]  You're not even writing the emote.
[8457.38s -> 8460.50s]  Jerma, give me your minotaur skull and your other thing.
[8460.50s -> 8461.54s]  Minotaur skull and the...
[8462.42s -> 8463.14s]  Okay, buddy.
[8463.86s -> 8466.61s]  Give them to me.
[8466.61s -> 8467.65s]  All right, hold on.
[8467.65s -> 8468.13s]  Geez, I'm kidding.
[8468.13s -> 8468.69s]  Give them.
[8468.69s -> 8474.21s]  What an idiot.
[8474.21s -> 8474.85s]  Get robbed.
[8477.73s -> 8479.09s]  I'm a summoner now.
[8479.09s -> 8487.54s]  Oh yeah, that's right.
[8487.54s -> 8488.74s]  You are the summoner now.
[8488.74s -> 8495.49s]  All right, we have a pretty interesting platform now
[8495.49s -> 8499.09s]  to like escape stuff and like drop down and escape that and jump here and...
[8508.61s -> 8510.29s]  All right, I'm gonna pee, okay?
[8511.17s -> 8513.01s]  While the goblins invade, he's gonna pee.
[8513.25s -> 8513.89s]  No, fine.
[8513.89s -> 8514.85s]  I won't.
[8514.85s -> 8516.95s]  I thought you said this wasn't a big deal.
[8517.83s -> 8519.99s]  Yeah, but you have to like actually do this one.
[8523.04s -> 8524.16s]  Blood moon just kind of ends.
[8524.16s -> 8525.60s]  This one has like a percentage.
[8526.40s -> 8526.90s]  Oh.
[8527.60s -> 8528.64s]  Is there a boss again?
[8528.64s -> 8530.00s]  I would appreciate your help.
[8531.20s -> 8532.32s]  Because all I do is give.
[8535.89s -> 8536.85s]  Just pee my pants.
[8538.74s -> 8539.38s]  Just what?
[8539.94s -> 8540.58s]  I said I have...
[8540.58s -> 8541.94s]  Somebody said just pee.
[8541.94s -> 8542.66s]  Just like pee your pants.
[8542.66s -> 8543.94s]  Just go to the bathroom.
[8543.94s -> 8544.44s]  Yeah, good.
[8545.54s -> 8550.76s]  The thing is, I could do that and no one would know I actually did that.
[8551.48s -> 8558.72s]  I mean, you'd probably tell everyone.
[8559.52s -> 8564.50s]  Where's Jerma?
[8564.50s -> 8565.22s]  Jerma, I need you.
[8565.94s -> 8567.70s]  I'm right here.
[8567.70s -> 8568.50s]  Jerma, take this.
[8572.16s -> 8573.11s]  It's the thing.
[8573.11s -> 8573.67s]  It's the thing.
[8573.67s -> 8575.43s]  Oh my god, this is the best birthday ever.
[8576.47s -> 8576.87s]  Thank you.
[8577.59s -> 8579.25s]  Hey, no problem.
[8579.97s -> 8582.00s]  All I do is give.
[8582.96s -> 8585.68s]  Well, to be fair, you did just take that from me before an invasion.
[8586.48s -> 8592.22s]  Sorry?
[8598.74s -> 8601.67s]  Don't...
[8601.67s -> 8603.19s]  Stop comparing this game to Minecraft.
[8603.19s -> 8604.15s]  It's way different.
[8607.94s -> 8608.98s]  Nobody wrote any of that.
[8608.98s -> 8609.30s]  I just...
[8609.30s -> 8611.70s]  I'm trying just to cause constant conflict in the chat.
[8614.34s -> 8615.46s]  That's usually what I'm doing.
[8617.22s -> 8618.10s]  You need some help?
[8618.10s -> 8619.46s]  I can do a better job.
[8619.46s -> 8621.78s]  No, I do not need your help in that.
[8621.78s -> 8623.06s]  Oh, because I'm too good?
[8623.06s -> 8623.78s]  No, I...
[8623.78s -> 8624.26s]  We don't...
[8624.26s -> 8625.78s]  We do not need like a...
[8625.78s -> 8627.94s]  Like here comes like a hot take from Star.
[8628.74s -> 8630.29s]  I have some pretty good takes.
[8630.29s -> 8631.73s]  No, I don't want any of those takes.
[8632.37s -> 8636.26s]  I don't want to hear any of those.
[8639.24s -> 8644.58s]  All right, I guess that's fair.
[8645.72s -> 8646.68s]  I think so too.
[8647.40s -> 8648.20s]  It's pretty fair.
[8649.00s -> 8653.99s]  So this is this you would?
[8655.86s -> 8656.82s]  Oh, yeah.
[8656.82s -> 8657.94s]  You don't have to chop it.
[8657.94s -> 8658.74s]  They just drop it.
[8659.54s -> 8660.96s]  It's really helpful that way.
[8660.96s -> 8661.60s]  It's very helpful.
[8663.92s -> 8665.04s]  Or you could plant trees.
[8665.76s -> 8672.07s]  Goblin army has been defeated.
[8673.03s -> 8673.51s]  Good job.
[8674.39s -> 8675.83s]  So now what does that do?
[8677.38s -> 8680.34s]  Should hopefully aid in finding this goblin asshole.
[8682.71s -> 8684.07s]  All right, I have to go pee.
[8684.07s -> 8685.56s]  I'll be right back.
[8685.56s -> 8687.24s]  All right, I'm going to go spelunking.
[8687.24s -> 8688.60s]  Everyone on the squad stream,
[8688.60s -> 8690.20s]  click over to Star's stream now
[8690.20s -> 8691.96s]  because that guy's just going to stand still
[8694.42s -> 8695.46s]  and type in my chat.
[8696.50s -> 8698.98s]  Like what happened to Hillary's emails?
[8698.98s -> 8700.10s]  What about them?
[8700.10s -> 8700.98s]  Hey, don't worry.
[8700.98s -> 8701.54s]  We'll be back.
[8702.18s -> 8705.32s]  We can all have like an intelligent discussion
[8705.32s -> 8706.04s]  now that he's gone.
[8707.16s -> 8707.96s]  I am absolutely...
[8707.96s -> 8709.56s]  By the way, I'm absolutely...
[8709.56s -> 8710.44s]  I'm gonna cut you.
[8710.44s -> 8710.76s]  I'm like...
[8711.40s -> 8712.12s]  He's...
[8712.12s -> 8712.68s]  No, it is...
[8712.68s -> 8713.40s]  I'm not going to...
[8713.40s -> 8715.00s]  I'm not going to walk away.
[8715.00s -> 8716.20s]  You think I'm going to walk away?
[8716.20s -> 8716.44s]  No.
[8717.46s -> 8718.66s]  All right, I'll see you later.
[8718.66s -> 8719.78s]  I'll be back in like two minutes.
[8882.37s -> 8882.87s]  Okay.
[8884.13s -> 8885.41s]  I am...
[8887.92s -> 8888.48s]  I'm back.
[8889.60s -> 8890.80s]  Hey, how's it going?
[8891.36s -> 8892.16s]  How are you?
[8892.16s -> 8893.60s]  Okay, let's go.
[8893.60s -> 8894.56s]  What do you say?
[8894.56s -> 8895.20s]  What do we do now?
[8900.28s -> 8903.08s]  I am looking for the goblin tinker.
[8903.08s -> 8903.58s]  Cool.
[8904.12s -> 8906.20s]  That's 100% the priority.
[8906.20s -> 8908.76s]  I have popped a hunter potion to see enemies,
[8908.76s -> 8910.68s]  which apparently, according to my...
[8910.68s -> 8913.08s]  I'm going to continue to build our boss chat room.
[8915.48s -> 8918.44s]  If you want to actually build an insane boss arena...
[8918.44s -> 8919.16s]  That's what I'm going to do.
[8924.85s -> 8926.93s]  You can make an arena out of minecart tracks.
[8927.99s -> 8929.59s]  And then at the end of a minecart track,
[8929.59s -> 8931.91s]  you can change it so you turn and change directions,
[8931.91s -> 8935.91s]  and you can actually make an in-the-air diamond-shaped minecart
[8936.47s -> 8938.71s]  that just drives you around in circles.
[8938.71s -> 8939.21s]  Pretty dope.
[8940.07s -> 8944.23s]  All right, I'm going to do one more of these.
[8944.79s -> 8948.88s]  If you like having like four,
[8948.88s -> 8950.72s]  and then also just in case you fall,
[8951.52s -> 8954.24s]  you know, we need some one down here too.
[8957.76s -> 8959.28s]  This is more for me than it is for you.
[8959.92s -> 8968.23s]  Okay.
[8968.23s -> 8969.75s]  People are telling me to get the boots.
[8969.75s -> 8970.95s]  Get the boots, get the boots, get the boots.
[8970.95s -> 8972.79s]  Should I get the Hermes boots?
[8972.79s -> 8973.59s]  Should I just get them?
[8979.32s -> 8979.82s]  Yeah.
[8980.28s -> 8982.31s]  Especially if you don't even know what they do,
[8982.31s -> 8987.11s]  so you need to like experience what they're doing for you.
[8988.23s -> 8989.27s]  I will after I do this.
[9000.18s -> 9004.15s]  Watch out, bug.
[9005.94s -> 9007.14s]  Or maybe you could wait.
[9011.24s -> 9011.96s]  Actually, I don't know.
[9013.38s -> 9015.38s]  He spawned flat ground just off screen.
[9016.02s -> 9017.80s]  There we go.
[9017.80s -> 9018.76s]  And then I'm going to do this.
[9031.25s -> 9032.77s]  Just in case, you know, a little spot.
[9033.57s -> 9049.41s]  This is fun.
[9051.57s -> 9052.61s]  Enjoying building, you know,
[9052.61s -> 9054.77s]  a nice little simple build stream, no pressure.
[9055.33s -> 9056.21s]  This is, yeah, let's just-
[9056.21s -> 9057.01s]  Flip that house.
[9060.18s -> 9061.78s]  Make sure you build a roof.
[9063.22s -> 9063.70s]  And-
[9063.70s -> 9064.18s]  A roof?
[9064.18s -> 9064.58s]  Why would I-
[9064.58s -> 9065.38s]  We need a roof on-
[9065.38s -> 9065.86s]  Here it is.
[9065.86s -> 9066.58s]  I found the guy.
[9073.86s -> 9076.26s]  And then you're going to want to get some heart statues,
[9076.26s -> 9078.02s]  you know, set up the red wire,
[9078.02s -> 9081.06s]  and you're like to have the hearts that you shoot out hearts for you.
[9081.06s -> 9091.94s]  All right, that's good.
[9091.94s -> 9093.62s]  Dude, it's Chuboy.
[9094.42s -> 9100.18s]  Someone said don't have the arena that close to the NPCs.
[9100.18s -> 9101.38s]  Yeah, I'll move.
[9101.38s -> 9103.94s]  Like, I'm going to have like another section over here.
[9104.66s -> 9106.50s]  Oh, somebody gives 10 community subs.
[9106.50s -> 9107.30s]  Who was it?
[9107.30s -> 9108.90s]  It wasn't me.
[9108.90s -> 9111.22s]  It's a great Canadian FK club.
[9112.84s -> 9113.64s]  Thanks for the 10 subs.
[9114.88s -> 9115.20s]  Thank you.
[9115.92s -> 9116.24s]  Sick.
[9116.80s -> 9117.68s]  That's a lot of subs.
[9117.68s -> 9118.18s]  Sick.
[9119.75s -> 9120.47s]  No, thank you so much.
[9121.60s -> 9122.64s]  What mods are being used?
[9123.60s -> 9125.20s]  Uh, times 5,000 damage.
[9126.71s -> 9128.31s]  We die instantly, one hit kill.
[9129.19s -> 9129.99s]  And permadeath.
[9132.82s -> 9135.78s]  Mean streamer gives sarcastic answer live on Twitch.
[9136.34s -> 9137.38s]  Never trust him again.
[9138.69s -> 9140.77s]  I've actually, I really don't, I don't even really know.
[9142.29s -> 9143.25s]  He's the mod guy.
[9143.25s -> 9144.77s]  He's like, hey, just join my server.
[9144.77s -> 9147.65s]  And it was like exclamation point mod.
[9149.92s -> 9151.12s]  And not Jermis chat.
[9153.49s -> 9154.37s]  It's still mildly inaccurate.
[9154.37s -> 9155.33s]  Silly physics.
[9156.13s -> 9159.12s]  Yeah, we have a silly physics mod.
[9171.03s -> 9172.15s]  I didn't buy the table.
[9173.94s -> 9174.26s]  Yeah.
[9174.26s -> 9175.22s]  He's going to like, I don't know.
[9175.22s -> 9176.74s]  How long does he spend down here?
[9176.74s -> 9177.62s]  He's already up.
[9177.62s -> 9178.26s]  No, he's not.
[9179.06s -> 9182.18s]  I don't have any god dang recall potions.
[9182.18s -> 9183.78s]  My life is misery.
[9186.29s -> 9186.85s]  Okay.
[9186.85s -> 9188.61s]  Oh, now I'm going to do that.
[9190.61s -> 9190.93s]  What?
[9191.65s -> 9193.78s]  Stop that.
[9194.34s -> 9200.72s]  So now you can just be like, oh, there he's coming down this way.
[9200.72s -> 9201.28s]  All right.
[9201.28s -> 9201.92s]  They're all up here.
[9201.92s -> 9202.42s]  Down.
[9203.04s -> 9203.36s]  All right.
[9203.36s -> 9205.36s]  Up we go this way.
[9206.24s -> 9207.36s]  They came, they dropped down up.
[9209.25s -> 9209.65s]  Okay.
[9209.65s -> 9212.10s]  Jerma, it'll be good.
[9212.10s -> 9214.55s]  I don't think I have enough gold.
[9215.92s -> 9216.72s]  Not enough gold?
[9216.72s -> 9217.60s]  What do you mean?
[9217.60s -> 9218.24s]  You need money?
[9225.75s -> 9225.99s]  All right.
[9225.99s -> 9226.47s]  That's enough.
[9227.51s -> 9229.11s]  Where do you go to get your swell on?
[9229.99s -> 9230.15s]  What?
[9230.15s -> 9232.07s]  Like, what's your what are your hobbies?
[9232.07s -> 9233.43s]  You have any outdoor activities?
[9233.43s -> 9235.19s]  You going outside in Vegas?
[9235.19s -> 9237.11s]  There's a lot of beautiful places in Vegas.
[9237.11s -> 9242.31s]  There's a lot of like mountains and trails and yeah, there's a lot of cool stuff.
[9242.31s -> 9243.27s]  But do you go to them?
[9243.91s -> 9248.07s]  Yeah, a couple of times when you have the opportunity.
[9248.95s -> 9252.00s]  I'm worried about you.
[9252.00s -> 9255.76s]  I mean, used to be like so in shape and so buff.
[9256.48s -> 9258.85s]  I could feel it.
[9258.85s -> 9260.53s]  Press B to run.
[9260.53s -> 9261.89s]  Nope, that's not going to work.
[9262.61s -> 9264.29s]  Okay, he's going to mute Mike again.
[9265.01s -> 9268.58s]  Why am I going to mute Mike?
[9271.36s -> 9271.76s]  I don't know.
[9271.76s -> 9273.28s]  You just don't like talking to me, I guess.
[9280.80s -> 9288.44s]  I want some like, I think I want some more coffee.
[9290.74s -> 9291.38s]  This late?
[9293.32s -> 9294.12s]  Yeah, never mind.
[9294.12s -> 9294.76s]  You're right.
[9294.76s -> 9295.96s]  This is too late.
[9297.08s -> 9300.60s]  Get some vodka.
[9301.32s -> 9304.77s]  I got too much shit to do.
[9305.41s -> 9313.40s]  And yet you're here playing Terraria.
[9314.04s -> 9320.90s]  What does this like hourglass looking dropper you've made?
[9320.90s -> 9321.86s]  It's just like a design.
[9322.66s -> 9324.90s]  Oh, so you're like splicing up our lives out here?
[9324.90s -> 9330.10s]  I mean, yeah, it's just like it's an easy aesthetically pleasing structure.
[9331.46s -> 9338.55s]  Oh, all right.
[9339.19s -> 9339.99s]  This is good, right?
[9340.79s -> 9344.50s]  We have a lot of places to go.
[9345.14s -> 9350.84s]  I'm going to do one more down here, but not actually down here.
[9351.64s -> 9364.45s]  Okay, because then it's like, oh, no, I fell off right here.
[9364.45s -> 9364.93s]  It's all right.
[9365.81s -> 9378.24s]  All right, now I'm going to go get the boots and put them on.
[9378.96s -> 9382.69s]  Do I have enough money?
[9384.04s -> 9384.92s]  Let's find out.
[9385.56s -> 9387.00s]  I'm a boot master.
[9387.00s -> 9388.04s]  I do have enough money.
[9388.68s -> 9390.32s]  Harpoon.
[9391.96s -> 9392.60s]  Is this any good?
[9400.10s -> 9400.90s]  Not really.
[9400.90s -> 9405.30s]  All right.
[9405.30s -> 9406.02s]  Spike bomb.
[9406.58s -> 9406.90s]  Cool.
[9408.60s -> 9409.80s]  This you would I'm just gonna put.
[9409.80s -> 9410.20s]  All right.
[9410.20s -> 9412.68s]  This is like four jumps.
[9412.68s -> 9415.32s]  Hey, this, this Nazar.
[9416.72s -> 9417.20s]  What is this?
[9417.76s -> 9419.36s]  It's like equipable immunity to curse.
[9419.36s -> 9421.92s]  Like, is this just a material that I'm going to need at some point later?
[9423.28s -> 9426.16s]  I don't remember what curse is.
[9427.60s -> 9428.24s]  So I don't know.
[9428.96s -> 9433.94s]  I think it's like good for a specific boss, but I forget which status is cursed.
[9434.18s -> 9434.98s]  Dude, look at this thing.
[9435.86s -> 9438.23s]  Look at this thing.
[9438.87s -> 9441.99s]  So what do I replace this with?
[9442.87s -> 9444.39s]  Well, you know, I know.
[9444.39s -> 9444.71s]  Okay.
[9445.75s -> 9449.11s]  So how many minions can I have now?
[9451.22s -> 9456.34s]  Count them up.
[9456.34s -> 9457.70s]  Max entries, max minions.
[9459.99s -> 9462.07s]  I have another room for another accessory, too.
[9462.95s -> 9474.20s]  Is there anything else I should be putting on?
[9475.56s -> 9478.18s]  What's the one that I have the mana one on already?
[9478.98s -> 9482.80s]  20 mana.
[9485.56s -> 9486.04s]  Boots.
[9486.04s -> 9488.28s]  One of the boots of boots, though, aren't they?
[9489.24s -> 9490.36s]  Or boots.
[9490.36s -> 9491.56s]  The boots are new boots.
[9491.56s -> 9492.68s]  They're not an accessory, right?
[9493.80s -> 9499.00s]  You can buy the Hermes boots and buy the rocket boots off the tinker and combine them to make
[9500.12s -> 9501.08s]  runny, jumpy boots.
[9508.50s -> 9509.22s]  Spectre boots.
[9509.22s -> 9509.86s]  Yeah.
[9509.86s -> 9512.34s]  But can I put this on?
[9513.14s -> 9517.67s]  Oh, this is where it gets tricky for me.
[9517.67s -> 9524.08s]  The boots are an accessory, they're not actual boots.
[9524.72s -> 9527.25s]  Well, I'm going to go get them.
[9527.25s -> 9529.59s]  Is that guy still on the roof or did you lock him in something?
[9530.47s -> 9535.83s]  A cobbler?
[9535.83s -> 9537.35s]  He should be in one of these rooms.
[9537.35s -> 9538.39s]  He's on the final room.
[9539.11s -> 9544.72s]  Oh, I don't have the Bank of fucking America mod.
[9545.36s -> 9546.00s]  I don't know.
[9548.24s -> 9549.76s]  I'm having Deja vu.
[9549.76s -> 9550.72s]  What is that?
[9550.72s -> 9557.32s]  I want to go find ice skates.
[9559.56s -> 9560.28s]  Do we have one?
[9563.40s -> 9563.72s]  All right.
[9563.72s -> 9564.44s]  Hermes boots.
[9565.24s -> 9566.18s]  I own them.
[9575.08s -> 9575.40s]  Wow.
[9575.96s -> 9577.08s]  Those are fun.
[9577.80s -> 9581.60s]  Oh shit, you can.
[9581.60s -> 9582.72s]  How do I get out of here?
[9582.72s -> 9583.22s]  Wow.
[9594.79s -> 9595.83s]  You are stuck.
[9596.47s -> 9598.87s]  Please rebuild that wall, though, because that'll stop being a house.
[9606.32s -> 9608.16s]  It'll stop being a house.
[9608.96s -> 9609.28s]  Yeah.
[9611.35s -> 9614.66s]  It's just standard wood to do that, right?
[9614.66s -> 9618.87s]  The wood that you just destroyed, you just picked up because you destroyed it.
[9618.87s -> 9619.51s]  So you have it.
[9625.81s -> 9627.17s]  I didn't know how that worked.
[9627.17s -> 9628.05s]  I didn't know if it fell.
[9630.34s -> 9635.91s]  All right.
[9635.91s -> 9636.23s]  Cool.
[9636.23s -> 9636.71s]  Nice hook.
[9638.15s -> 9638.55s]  Cool.
[9639.75s -> 9641.27s]  So now I have the boots.
[9641.27s -> 9642.95s]  I have that cool new item.
[9642.95s -> 9648.02s]  Let me see what I got now for, you know, stuff.
[9648.02s -> 9651.06s]  Get the rocket boots, rocket boots, rocket boots.
[9652.26s -> 9654.10s]  I think the tinker is still in the cave.
[9654.10s -> 9657.38s]  Yeah, I would just wait for him to appear, which will just be a while.
[9658.02s -> 9660.34s]  I think we might have to like leave this area and come back.
[9662.53s -> 9663.17s]  Okay.
[9663.17s -> 9670.69s]  Well, this is just a healing potion, 100 life versus 50 life.
[9671.41s -> 9676.53s]  How do I make it so does it do the better ones first when you press H?
[9676.53s -> 9677.49s]  I think so.
[9684.74s -> 9686.26s]  Oh, requires an ice machine.
[9686.26s -> 9686.66s]  Okay.
[9686.66s -> 9687.54s]  I knew it was something.
[9689.86s -> 9692.18s]  Get, get the sans head from the chest.
[9693.14s -> 9693.46s]  Hold on.
[9693.46s -> 9695.14s]  Let me like just go over what I need to like.
[9695.14s -> 9696.50s]  I just got this new item and shit.
[9700.77s -> 9706.93s]  So now I have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[9706.93s -> 9707.25s]  No, no, no.
[9707.25s -> 9707.65s]  Holy shit.
[9707.65s -> 9708.13s]  I'm an idiot.
[9709.09s -> 9710.45s]  I was like, no way.
[9710.45s -> 9712.69s]  I was like, wow, keep going.
[9712.69s -> 9713.73s]  They just keep spawning.
[9714.29s -> 9715.73s]  You'll get that many later though.
[9718.80s -> 9722.71s]  Two centuries and five of these.
[9726.15s -> 9729.22s]  All right.
[9729.22s -> 9731.38s]  So now this, what is this?
[9731.38s -> 9732.90s]  This thing, 28 magic damage.
[9736.39s -> 9737.11s]  Storm cloud.
[9737.11s -> 9738.79s]  I feel like I'm not using this at all.
[9740.24s -> 9741.20s]  19 magic damage.
[9741.20s -> 9743.28s]  It looks cool, but I'm not using it.
[9744.24s -> 9745.12s]  What about us we have?
[9745.92s -> 9750.26s]  Do I just drop those?
[9752.47s -> 9753.35s]  Do we?
[9753.35s -> 9757.14s]  I think I have to use the fucking sans head.
[9760.90s -> 9762.26s]  Would that be so bad?
[9762.26s -> 9764.10s]  No, I mean, I just don't like using it.
[9764.10s -> 9765.41s]  This is the day.
[9765.41s -> 9766.45s]  Why don't you like it?
[9767.97s -> 9771.00s]  I've given you everything, Jerma.
[9771.64s -> 9775.51s]  What's wrong?
[9775.91s -> 9779.35s]  Get the, do you think I was literally born yesterday?
[9787.41s -> 9788.13s]  I'm going to set you.
[9788.13s -> 9788.61s]  Oh yeah.
[9790.05s -> 9790.61s]  What's that?
[9797.94s -> 9799.22s]  Okay.
[9799.22s -> 9802.02s]  I think I have my gear that I want.
[9806.48s -> 9807.28s]  Okay.
[9807.28s -> 9808.32s]  Got my stuff.
[9808.32s -> 9811.56s]  I'm going to be able to have another one of these.
[9812.68s -> 9818.20s]  Minions, mana regen, life regen, defense, and movement speed.
[9818.92s -> 9820.36s]  Is what happens when I press B.
[9821.32s -> 9823.84s]  So that means I can have a sixth minion.
[9824.56s -> 9834.60s]  We have our arena over here that is being, it's not just one plane.
[9834.60s -> 9835.56s]  You can run around.
[9835.56s -> 9837.88s]  Should I put torches around every, up here?
[9842.23s -> 9843.51s]  I'd put campfires.
[9843.51s -> 9844.39s]  Campfires.
[9845.03s -> 9847.20s]  I don't know how to even make them.
[9847.20s -> 9850.32s]  Which is wood and torches.
[9850.32s -> 9851.44s]  Oh, okay.
[9851.44s -> 9855.68s]  I guess campfires give health regeneration.
[9855.68s -> 9857.20s]  How many should I just put them everywhere?
[9857.84s -> 9861.16s]  I guess.
[9861.88s -> 9864.12s]  Just fucking just have campfires everywhere.
[9865.00s -> 9865.64s]  Yeah, sure.
[9866.36s -> 9866.84s]  All right.
[9867.56s -> 9878.60s]  For 10 or 15 spaces.
[9878.60s -> 9879.16s]  Wow.
[9879.16s -> 9880.84s]  That's not specific at all.
[9880.84s -> 9881.16s]  Oh yeah.
[9881.16s -> 9882.04s]  We have a star fury.
[9885.32s -> 9885.80s]  Hold on.
[9892.28s -> 9893.40s]  We need those.
[9894.28s -> 9896.04s]  But we basically can make it.
[9896.04s -> 9896.60s]  God damn it.
[9896.60s -> 9900.28s]  I'd like the last time I played Terraria, I did a run with this weapon
[9900.28s -> 9902.92s]  and I don't want to do the same thing again, but it's such a good weapon.
[9903.80s -> 9908.02s]  Am I not picking those up?
[9914.04s -> 9914.60s]  No, wait.
[9915.86s -> 9916.10s]  Okay.
[9916.74s -> 9918.88s]  That was a yawn voice.
[9920.56s -> 9920.96s]  It was.
[9922.08s -> 9928.32s]  Last time I played this game, I used this weapon and I literally wanted to do it again.
[9930.58s -> 9932.10s]  I'm sorry that I'm boring you.
[9941.75s -> 9942.23s]  Do that again.
[9942.87s -> 9945.62s]  No, don't do it that fast.
[9946.42s -> 9950.82s]  Do it like every, like, do it like every one or do it every like two or three seconds.
[9951.54s -> 9952.87s]  Good.
[9952.87s -> 9953.35s]  Keep going.
[9953.35s -> 9960.88s]  Okay.
[9960.88s -> 9962.00s]  That's that's great.
[9963.20s -> 9969.46s]  That's that's great.
[9973.68s -> 9977.04s]  That's just wow.
[9981.68s -> 9982.64s]  That's great.
[9982.64s -> 9983.20s]  All right.
[9983.20s -> 9984.88s]  There's a lot of fires up here.
[9990.58s -> 9991.14s]  I love these.
[9994.08s -> 9994.40s]  Okay.
[9995.60s -> 9996.56s]  Here's what we're going to do.
[9996.56s -> 9996.80s]  Yep.
[9997.83s -> 9999.91s]  We're going to fight this thing one more time.
[9999.91s -> 10000.47s]  Okay.
[10000.47s -> 10000.79s]  Hold on.
[10000.79s -> 10001.35s]  Let me just do.
[10002.31s -> 10003.43s]  Oh, stop hitting me.
[10004.15s -> 10004.95s]  There's a rope here.
[10009.49s -> 10012.37s]  Should I do like a Donkey Kong tropical breeze?
[10012.37s -> 10015.33s]  Whatever the name of that game is and have like vines to like climb on?
[10021.43s -> 10022.55s]  Probably not.
[10022.55s -> 10025.35s]  If they like hit you while you're on a vine, you get released.
[10025.35s -> 10026.15s]  Unless we can.
[10026.15s -> 10028.07s]  I think you can craft cobalt shields in this.
[10028.07s -> 10029.43s]  That would actually be really helpful.
[10030.15s -> 10031.03s]  I don't know how to do it.
[10031.75s -> 10036.44s]  They're saying hang heart lanterns.
[10037.08s -> 10044.05s]  Yeah, just because you like get like, you know what I'm saying?
[10044.05s -> 10045.73s]  Jump, jump, jump like from vine to vine.
[10049.17s -> 10053.41s]  You're going to try and do that during the fight and you think you want it, but you don't.
[10053.41s -> 10055.25s]  But what if, but just what if there's a reason?
[10055.25s -> 10056.05s]  What if it happens?
[10056.05s -> 10057.09s]  What if you just fight?
[10057.09s -> 10059.17s]  What if, what if you just have a scenario where that works?
[10061.54s -> 10062.66s]  You think you want it.
[10065.06s -> 10065.54s]  All right.
[10065.54s -> 10068.85s]  So I think we have a decent area here.
[10077.60s -> 10082.69s]  But you don't.
[10082.69s -> 10083.33s]  Here, take this.
[10083.33s -> 10083.81s]  I don't want it.
[10089.25s -> 10099.99s]  Glass.
[10099.99s -> 10102.47s]  I don't want to make glass, dude.
[10102.47s -> 10104.23s]  But I like need to really bad.
[10105.19s -> 10130.68s]  So, um, chat is, you wouldn't, you're making fun of me for like doing,
[10132.12s -> 10133.40s]  like picking up shitty stuff.
[10133.40s -> 10136.52s]  But somebody said they were watching the other stream
[10136.52s -> 10139.80s]  and they're saying that you, your inventory looks fucking stupid right now.
[10140.68s -> 10141.64s]  Like it's being spammed.
[10143.06s -> 10143.30s]  What?
[10146.26s -> 10148.74s]  You're like, oh, you pick it up like dumb shit, like stuff we don't need.
[10148.74s -> 10150.66s]  And there's somebody saying that you're in your inventory.
[10150.66s -> 10152.98s]  You have like a bunch of trash.
[10152.98s -> 10153.54s]  Is this true?
[10154.50s -> 10156.93s]  I mean, like one or two things.
[10156.93s -> 10157.33s]  What is it?
[10159.62s -> 10161.14s]  It's not a big deal.
[10161.14s -> 10162.18s]  What do you have in your inventory?
[10162.18s -> 10163.38s]  That's like, so there's such a problem.
[10164.10s -> 10167.83s]  Throwing knives, jester arrows.
[10172.12s -> 10173.96s]  Why do you have jester arrows?
[10173.96s -> 10175.48s]  Because I picked them up.
[10178.72s -> 10179.76s]  Want to fight about it?
[10183.60s -> 10185.04s]  I forgot what I was looking for here.
[10185.92s -> 10187.84s]  Wait, does he have like auto trash?
[10191.04s -> 10194.56s]  Nobody said that drama making shit up constant conflict.
[10195.75s -> 10199.67s]  I was taking stuff out of the, I was taking stuff out of our bank and throwing it at you.
[10200.31s -> 10203.72s]  And I think I might've just deleted a bunch of stuff because you have it on auto delete.
[10206.07s -> 10207.04s]  What?
[10207.12s -> 10210.88s]  I've been throwing shit at you while you were staring at like nothing.
[10210.88s -> 10211.60s]  Oh yeah.
[10211.60s -> 10213.76s]  Then I was probably just fucking deleting it.
[10213.76s -> 10216.32s]  If you're throwing like really stupid shit at me.
[10218.55s -> 10219.67s]  Like, what did you throw at me?
[10219.67s -> 10220.39s]  I don't remember.
[10220.39s -> 10223.19s]  It might've been, there was a magnum.
[10223.19s -> 10224.55s]  You threw magnum rounds at me?
[10225.27s -> 10227.59s]  Like, I know you don't need them.
[10231.19s -> 10232.15s]  Flaming arrows.
[10232.15s -> 10234.47s]  Like, okay, let's fight this fucking boss.
[10234.47s -> 10235.19s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[10235.19s -> 10235.83s]  Get ready for it.
[10237.76s -> 10239.12s]  Wait, I need, I need those.
[10239.68s -> 10240.40s]  I gave you something.
[10240.40s -> 10240.88s]  I need them back.
[10241.52s -> 10242.40s]  What do you need?
[10242.40s -> 10242.88s]  I don't know.
[10242.88s -> 10243.84s]  The thing that shoots the bee.
[10244.48s -> 10245.35s]  The bee gun.
[10245.99s -> 10249.33s]  I gave you like ammo.
[10249.33s -> 10250.13s]  Wooden arrows.
[10252.61s -> 10254.37s]  You gave me 500 wooden arrows.
[10254.37s -> 10254.93s]  Here you go.
[10254.93s -> 10256.13s]  Here's your trash bag.
[10256.13s -> 10256.61s]  Thank you.
[10257.81s -> 10258.21s]  Okay.
[10258.21s -> 10258.85s]  All right.
[10258.85s -> 10259.73s]  Touch this.
[10263.94s -> 10264.26s]  Hold on.
[10264.26s -> 10265.14s]  I need to get this.
[10267.46s -> 10270.58s]  So we're doing the same thing.
[10271.78s -> 10272.98s]  I'm just touch the thing.
[10273.86s -> 10276.72s]  I'm going to spawn all my friends.
[10276.72s -> 10279.36s]  Just let me know when you are ready to do this.
[10281.51s -> 10282.47s]  Do that thing.
[10283.19s -> 10283.67s]  Okay.
[10287.06s -> 10287.86s]  I'm ready.
[10288.50s -> 10289.44s]  Okay, let's go.
[10290.32s -> 10324.20s]  I mean, is this kind of cheating if you just build platforms?
[10357.56s -> 10359.16s]  Is this like cheating?
[10359.16s -> 10359.48s]  Stop.
[10360.04s -> 10361.40s]  I'm concentrating.
[10361.40s -> 10368.34s]  But it's cheating though, right?
[10368.90s -> 10370.34s]  Stop it.
[10370.34s -> 10376.31s]  Can we do it?
[10379.43s -> 10379.75s]  Shell.
[10379.75s -> 10380.31s]  Oh, what was that?
[10380.31s -> 10381.35s]  That was huge.
[10381.35s -> 10382.45s]  That was all the-
[10382.45s -> 10383.17s]  Slime god.
[10385.03s -> 10385.51s]  Oh, yeah.
[10385.51s -> 10386.79s]  Gives you this stupid item.
[10387.51s -> 10389.43s]  It's going to give you a place in your inventory
[10389.43s -> 10392.07s]  that like permanently makes you slippery.
[10392.07s -> 10393.67s]  Oh, yeah.
[10393.67s -> 10394.55s]  I hate this.
[10394.55s -> 10395.35s]  How do I get rid of this?
[10396.07s -> 10396.79s]  You just delete it.
[10398.71s -> 10399.81s]  Get rid of that.
[10399.81s -> 10400.45s]  But what does it-
[10401.09s -> 10403.41s]  He gives purified gel, which is a crafting thing.
[10403.89s -> 10406.13s]  Some stuff.
[10406.13s -> 10407.01s]  But should we-
[10407.01s -> 10409.49s]  Does this have any purpose at all?
[10409.49s -> 10409.97s]  No.
[10409.97s -> 10410.21s]  None.
[10415.25s -> 10417.01s]  Don't even put this in the-
[10417.01s -> 10417.73s]  Just throw it away.
[10417.73s -> 10418.13s]  No.
[10418.13s -> 10421.84s]  Because are you ever going to want to slide around?
[10421.84s -> 10424.40s]  I mean, can I slide around and do like a thousand damage a second?
[10425.20s -> 10425.76s]  No.
[10425.76s -> 10429.88s]  All right, I threw it away.
[10430.52s -> 10433.06s]  You're going to slide into my DMs though.
[10440.00s -> 10440.48s]  What?
[10440.48s -> 10448.42s]  A frog leg.
[10449.06s -> 10451.59s]  All right, what are-
[10455.76s -> 10461.76s]  Okay, a long time ago, you told me about this weapon, this Arcalis.
[10463.08s -> 10463.24s]  Yeah.
[10463.24s -> 10465.00s]  And oh, you can turn it into something eventually.
[10465.80s -> 10466.52s]  Yes.
[10466.52s -> 10468.76s]  We need to be in hard mode to finish it.
[10468.76s -> 10469.26s]  Okay.
[10470.61s -> 10472.45s]  It is a really, really, really good weapon though.
[10472.45s -> 10474.05s]  But we would just need to kill wall of flesh
[10474.05s -> 10475.25s]  and then we could basically build it.
[10477.68s -> 10477.92s]  Okay.
[10479.52s -> 10481.60s]  He put the slime god shit in the chest.
[10481.60s -> 10482.00s]  What shit?
[10482.00s -> 10482.56s]  What did you do?
[10483.76s -> 10485.84s]  Well, what a bunch of fucking tattletales.
[10487.57s -> 10487.89s]  Really?
[10489.22s -> 10490.58s]  Am I being pranked right now?
[10490.58s -> 10491.22s]  No, I just-
[10491.22s -> 10494.74s]  I put the slime god thing in the box to save it in case-
[10494.74s -> 10496.18s]  just in case we wanted it.
[10497.30s -> 10498.90s]  And everybody ran-
[10500.10s -> 10500.82s]  No, it's not.
[10501.86s -> 10503.65s]  What if we want to use it?
[10503.65s -> 10505.33s]  He put it in the box.
[10506.37s -> 10511.91s]  This is why we shouldn't be squad streaming right now.
[10514.07s -> 10515.59s]  You know what? Communication is key.
[10516.47s -> 10517.75s]  Eventually it all comes out.
[10517.75s -> 10519.99s]  Somebody said get carnage.
[10520.63s -> 10522.63s]  Carnage?
[10524.71s -> 10527.43s]  Carnage is a sword that I have.
[10527.43s -> 10528.23s]  Oh, you have it.
[10529.19s -> 10530.31s]  Why? Does it make something?
[10531.19s -> 10532.39s]  Get carnage from storage.
[10533.81s -> 10534.85s]  No, I have it.
[10536.12s -> 10537.24s]  Why do you need it?
[10537.24s -> 10537.64s]  I don't know.
[10537.64s -> 10539.56s]  Somebody just wrote in all caps like, get it.
[10540.36s -> 10541.56s]  Okay, well ignore that guy.
[10543.00s -> 10543.40s]  I don't know.
[10543.40s -> 10545.24s]  I'm just- people have thrown out ideas.
[10546.20s -> 10551.76s]  He reads the one guy that says carnage,
[10551.76s -> 10554.24s]  but not the spam for the rocket boots.
[10554.88s -> 10556.47s]  I can't even make the rocket boots
[10556.47s -> 10557.91s]  because the goblin isn't up here.
[10557.91s -> 10558.23s]  Is he?
[10559.81s -> 10560.61s]  Oh, he's up here now.
[10560.61s -> 10562.85s]  He's this blue guy in a-
[10562.85s -> 10564.85s]  So I can do it now.
[10564.85s -> 10566.05s]  I couldn't do it before.
[10566.05s -> 10567.17s]  I would have to go-
[10567.17s -> 10568.45s]  There was a reason why I've been waiting.
[10569.25s -> 10570.66s]  It's a reforge, right?
[10573.89s -> 10576.37s]  No, reforge is to reforge the random stat.
[10576.37s -> 10577.57s]  What you're doing is shopping.
[10577.57s -> 10579.25s]  Because he has rocket boots.
[10579.25s -> 10580.29s]  Allows flight.
[10580.29s -> 10582.05s]  And then I combine the rocket boots
[10582.05s -> 10584.53s]  and the Hermes boots.
[10584.53s -> 10587.17s]  This table right here is the combining table
[10587.17s -> 10588.53s]  that you're standing in front of right now.
[10589.57s -> 10590.93s]  You can combine rocket boots
[10590.93s -> 10592.61s]  and Hermes boots to make specter boots.
[10594.53s -> 10596.61s]  And then I think you can combine
[10596.61s -> 10598.45s]  specter boots and Zephyr,
[10598.45s -> 10600.85s]  which I will give you even though I was using it.
[10602.05s -> 10603.41s]  And then you can make lightning boots.
[10603.41s -> 10605.57s]  The warican runs super fast.
[10605.57s -> 10607.25s]  So I've got Hermes boots, rocket boots,
[10607.25s -> 10608.93s]  specter boots, and then specter boots
[10608.93s -> 10611.17s]  and whatever you just threw to me
[10611.89s -> 10612.37s]  makes another one.
[10612.37s -> 10613.33s]  Makes lightning boots.
[10617.14s -> 10621.09s]  Okay, lightning boots.
[10621.81s -> 10625.01s]  Allows flight, the warican run incredibly fast.
[10627.44s -> 10628.40s]  Wow, this is cool.
[10628.40s -> 10629.52s]  All right, let's go.
[10629.52s -> 10631.28s]  And then the next thing that I did, I-
[10631.28s -> 10633.68s]  What? You need to also get some shit
[10633.68s -> 10635.36s]  to make frostbark boots.
[10638.47s -> 10639.35s]  It just keeps going.
[10639.35s -> 10642.47s]  Is this monster hunter or is this terraria?
[10643.86s -> 10645.22s]  A bit of both.
[10645.22s -> 10645.94s]  Holy shit.
[10653.08s -> 10655.65s]  I could, how much?
[10655.65s -> 10657.01s]  They're like little bunny slippers.
[10659.06s -> 10660.02s]  That's the takeaway.
[10660.02s -> 10661.46s]  They're bunny slippers.
[10662.79s -> 10665.11s]  Oh, this is like, this is great.
[10665.11s -> 10666.55s]  Oh, are you talking about carnage ray?
[10666.55s -> 10667.35s]  The like staff?
[10667.99s -> 10675.80s]  We could probably make that.
[10675.80s -> 10676.92s]  I think we have most of this.
[10677.56s -> 10679.09s]  I'm too lazy.
[10679.09s -> 10681.09s]  That's, yeah, this is not that fast though.
[10684.23s -> 10686.15s]  I mean, it has to, it queues up
[10686.15s -> 10687.99s]  and you go, you have to be running
[10687.99s -> 10689.11s]  for a while for this to work.
[10692.45s -> 10694.21s]  Yeah, if you use your grappling hook,
[10694.21s -> 10695.57s]  you instantly get to run speed.
[10695.57s -> 10696.21s]  Oh, really?
[10697.09s -> 10698.23s]  Okay.
[10698.23s -> 10699.19s]  I didn't know that.
[10699.19s -> 10699.91s]  Let me test that.
[10700.63s -> 10706.93s]  Perfectly on the ground.
[10707.49s -> 10710.87s]  All right, so we're walking,
[10710.87s -> 10712.07s]  we're walking, we're walking.
[10713.59s -> 10716.64s]  Oh dude, this is actually probably what
[10716.64s -> 10717.68s]  you should be making.
[10717.68s -> 10718.72s]  This would be very good.
[10719.76s -> 10720.24s]  I see.
[10720.24s -> 10720.74s]  Okay.
[10721.12s -> 10727.27s]  You gotta release the hook first, too.
[10727.91s -> 10728.55s]  All right, I get it.
[10728.55s -> 10729.67s]  Oh, goo bow.
[10733.65s -> 10735.33s]  So, ah, these are cool.
[10738.72s -> 10739.92s]  Hey, why'd you even kill that boar?
[10739.92s -> 10741.04s]  There was no reason to kill that boar.
[10742.00s -> 10748.95s]  Here we go.
[10751.91s -> 10752.71s]  Oh, that's so fun.
[10753.43s -> 10767.04s]  I wasn't making a joke.
[10767.04s -> 10769.04s]  I was just wanting to say, here we go.
[10770.08s -> 10773.00s]  All right, what do you want to do?
[10775.04s -> 10776.32s]  One second, I'm reading something.
[10777.12s -> 10778.80s]  Oh, and we kind of need hell stone,
[10778.80s -> 10780.40s]  but also we can kind of just honestly
[10780.40s -> 10781.84s]  skip a lot of this if we just kill
[10781.84s -> 10782.64s]  the wall of flesh.
[10783.44s -> 10786.05s]  What else can this be turned into?
[10787.99s -> 10790.15s]  Frost spark boots, lightning boots,
[10790.15s -> 10790.95s]  and ice skates.
[10791.67s -> 10795.68s]  Okay, allows flight super fast running
[10795.68s -> 10797.04s]  and extra mobility on ice,
[10797.04s -> 10798.48s]  seven percent increase movement speed.
[10799.44s -> 10800.95s]  What do you get the ice gate?
[10803.48s -> 10805.80s]  You can make ice skates out of leather
[10805.80s -> 10806.68s]  and ice blocks.
[10807.40s -> 10809.49s]  Leather and ice blocks.
[10810.37s -> 10819.22s]  Okay, without these on,
[10819.78s -> 10821.70s]  I don't think I would play the game.
[10821.70s -> 10823.22s]  I'm just realizing how slow that is.
[10824.10s -> 10825.94s]  Yeah, that's pretty bad.
[10828.90s -> 10831.70s]  Wow, it doesn't feel like an immediate,
[10831.70s -> 10832.34s]  it is.
[10832.34s -> 10832.98s]  That's huge.
[10836.98s -> 10838.02s]  You can never go back now.
[10840.44s -> 10841.96s]  There's a couple things we can do.
[10841.96s -> 10843.40s]  Like, because we killed that boss,
[10843.40s -> 10845.16s]  we have a material that can make
[10845.16s -> 10847.08s]  a bunch of stuff and a lot of it's good.
[10847.72s -> 10876.87s]  Yeah, my internet's not not up.
[10881.80s -> 10882.84s]  That was weird.
[10882.84s -> 10884.60s]  No, my internet's like not my internet's fine.
[10886.58s -> 10887.70s]  That wasn't like my internet.
[10888.34s -> 10890.04s]  That was weird.
[10890.68s -> 10893.30s]  Was it?
[10893.30s -> 10894.26s]  It's Twitch.
[10894.26s -> 10897.12s]  Oh, not my Twitch.
[10900.47s -> 10901.51s]  It was Twitch's fault.
[10901.51s -> 10904.07s]  Oh, maybe the server like ingest servers.
[10904.95s -> 10906.07s]  Not my Twitch.
[10906.07s -> 10907.75s]  Twitch took manual control.
[10907.75s -> 10908.63s]  All right, well, you guys.
[10911.41s -> 10911.81s]  I didn't try.
[10911.81s -> 10913.01s]  I didn't leave the game, right?
[10913.01s -> 10913.97s]  Like my internet.
[10913.97s -> 10914.69s]  I was still in the game.
[10915.17s -> 10915.89s]  I don't think you did.
[10915.89s -> 10917.17s]  But usually, I mean, it takes a while
[10917.17s -> 10918.21s]  if you're going to drop.
[10918.21s -> 10921.97s]  I just assumed you're like basically gone.
[10922.85s -> 10923.81s]  But I think you're still here.
[10924.61s -> 10926.45s]  I guess it was just a weird like
[10926.45s -> 10927.49s]  server issue or something.
[10928.45s -> 10929.49s]  But we're here.
[10929.49s -> 10930.05s]  What do you want to do?
[10932.31s -> 10933.83s]  I really want to make a bow.
[10933.83s -> 10934.95s]  I need some hellstone.
[10934.95s -> 10936.55s]  You can help me mine hellstone
[10936.55s -> 10937.99s]  and then we can kill the wall of flesh.
[10938.63s -> 10939.19s]  OK.
[10939.19s -> 10940.79s]  I don't know if that sounds like a plan.
[10940.79s -> 10943.19s]  Hellstone is a huge pain in the ass to mine.
[10943.19s -> 10945.35s]  Hellstone, I'm remembering.
[10947.17s -> 10949.01s]  And I didn't get an obsidian potion.
[10949.01s -> 10950.53s]  You should buy an obsidian potion.
[10950.53s -> 10952.05s]  Buy an obsidian potion.
[10953.09s -> 10958.85s]  Yeah, which is what I should have done.
[10958.85s -> 10961.01s]  But I can't return because I don't have a fucking mirror.
[10961.01s -> 10961.65s]  Do we have any?
[10963.94s -> 10964.74s]  We might.
[10964.74s -> 10966.90s]  But I mean, the potion seller will sell them.
[10966.90s -> 10968.50s]  Oh, potion seller?
[10970.26s -> 10971.94s]  Give me your finest potion.
[10972.74s -> 10973.54s]  I wasn't going to do it.
[10973.54s -> 10974.02s]  Oh, my God.
[10974.02s -> 10975.14s]  I wasn't going to do it.
[10975.14s -> 10975.86s]  Oh, man.
[10975.86s -> 10976.10s]  Yeah.
[10976.98s -> 10977.62s]  How many do you want?
[10980.00s -> 10980.80s]  Bring me one.
[10980.80s -> 10982.72s]  So bring like two or four.
[10984.74s -> 10990.44s]  I can afford three obsidian skin potion, right?
[10991.24s -> 10991.96s]  Yep.
[10991.96s -> 10993.08s]  Just make sure I got the right thing.
[10994.34s -> 10994.66s]  All right.
[10995.46s -> 10997.06s]  Do we have any of those wormhole potions?
[10999.00s -> 10999.96s]  I don't think I have any.
[11000.84s -> 11002.36s]  You can buy some from that guy as well.
[11003.08s -> 11003.72s]  Oh, OK.
[11003.72s -> 11004.28s]  I'll get some.
[11005.08s -> 11010.95s]  Let me buy a couple of those.
[11014.56s -> 11015.20s]  Wormhole.
[11016.64s -> 11017.70s]  There they are.
[11018.50s -> 11021.32s]  All right.
[11021.32s -> 11024.52s]  I am going to teleport to you in just a few seconds.
[11024.52s -> 11025.40s]  Just a few moments.
[11026.20s -> 11027.24s]  I'm bracing myself.
[11028.04s -> 11029.48s]  I'm standing over lava.
[11029.48s -> 11030.28s]  In a moment.
[11031.08s -> 11031.32s]  OK.
[11031.32s -> 11031.88s]  So get some.
[11031.88s -> 11032.44s]  We're safe.
[11033.16s -> 11033.72s]  I'm safe.
[11033.72s -> 11034.28s]  You were safe?
[11035.00s -> 11035.32s]  Yes.
[11035.96s -> 11036.28s]  OK.
[11041.17s -> 11042.05s]  Where the fuck are you?
[11042.77s -> 11043.89s]  Oh, here we go.
[11046.10s -> 11046.66s]  I have brought.
[11048.50s -> 11049.46s]  Excuse me.
[11049.46s -> 11049.70s]  Hey.
[11050.34s -> 11051.14s]  I have brought you.
[11052.74s -> 11053.94s]  I'm going to drink one of these, right?
[11054.66s -> 11055.30s]  OK.
[11055.30s -> 11056.26s]  And then you can do that.
[11057.56s -> 11057.96s]  Here you go.
[11059.54s -> 11060.26s]  Oh, fuck.
[11062.26s -> 11063.67s]  How do I throw it?
[11064.39s -> 11064.95s]  Right click.
[11066.48s -> 11066.80s]  OK.
[11071.89s -> 11072.37s]  OK.
[11072.37s -> 11075.09s]  So Hellstone is these rocks down here.
[11075.81s -> 11078.05s]  If you stand on them, even with obsidian potion,
[11078.05s -> 11079.17s]  you'll still take damage.
[11080.63s -> 11081.91s]  And it won't make any noise.
[11081.91s -> 11083.11s]  Your character won't scream.
[11083.11s -> 11084.23s]  You'll just slowly die.
[11084.23s -> 11085.67s]  And it's one of the worst things.
[11085.67s -> 11085.99s]  OK.
[11088.45s -> 11090.77s]  So the deal is, what are we trying to mine?
[11090.77s -> 11091.17s]  These ones?
[11093.00s -> 11093.48s]  I don't know.
[11094.52s -> 11095.16s]  I just don't know.
[11095.16s -> 11095.72s]  What are we mining?
[11095.72s -> 11096.36s]  I don't know.
[11096.36s -> 11098.68s]  No, but I mean, what's the goal?
[11098.68s -> 11100.44s]  What are we trying to get, if you said?
[11100.44s -> 11101.16s]  The Hellstone.
[11101.16s -> 11102.36s]  We're mining the Hellstone.
[11102.36s -> 11104.60s]  And it'll hurt you if you stand on the Hellstone.
[11105.72s -> 11113.32s]  So that shit's Hellstone.
[11113.32s -> 11114.12s]  You drown in lava?
[11114.12s -> 11114.36s]  No.
[11116.58s -> 11118.18s]  You drown in lava.
[11118.18s -> 11120.08s]  Should I try to get some of that shit over there?
[11120.72s -> 11124.00s]  Is that going to burn me?
[11125.41s -> 11128.85s]  You can stand in lava for seven seconds with the obsidian potion.
[11130.07s -> 11132.95s]  Just make sure you don't actually stand on the Hellstone,
[11132.95s -> 11134.15s]  because it will still hurt you.
[11134.15s -> 11134.47s]  OK.
[11135.11s -> 11147.60s]  OK.
[11147.60s -> 11149.43s]  How much this do we need?
[11149.43s -> 11152.95s]  The poor guy occasionally blacks out during conversation.
[11155.11s -> 11156.28s]  We're worried about you.
[11156.28s -> 11157.08s]  You have any hobbies?
[11157.08s -> 11157.96s]  You get out there?
[11157.96s -> 11159.16s]  You get enough exercise?
[11161.54s -> 11162.90s]  No, there's just a lot going on,
[11162.90s -> 11165.54s]  but my second time ever playing Terraria.
[11168.68s -> 11169.16s]  Come on.
[11170.76s -> 11173.08s]  You have like 6,000 hours in this game.
[11173.08s -> 11174.92s]  This is the second time I've ever played it.
[11175.08s -> 11177.48s]  Nothing to do with how much Terraria you play.
[11177.48s -> 11178.04s]  Yes, it is.
[11178.04s -> 11180.92s]  It's how much you listen to people when they talk to you.
[11180.92s -> 11182.92s]  It's a lot of information to process.
[11183.88s -> 11194.92s]  He was busy reminiscing about the 50s.
[11195.56s -> 11198.50s]  At least someone's honest.
[11199.14s -> 11220.45s]  Can you delete lava?
[11222.64s -> 11224.24s]  Is this like a Minecraft way to block it?
[11226.32s -> 11226.56s]  No.
[11227.52s -> 11229.44s]  I mean, if you just like build around it.
[11230.64s -> 11234.29s]  Also, yeah, Hellstone creates lava when you mine it.
[11235.59s -> 11236.47s]  It's a thing that's happening.
[11237.27s -> 11238.96s]  All right.
[11238.96s -> 11240.72s]  I think if this function is going to run out here in a second,
[11241.28s -> 11244.58s]  I have 55 seconds.
[11248.60s -> 11249.32s]  I have a minute.
[11249.32s -> 11250.60s]  Oh, what was I doing?
[11251.56s -> 11255.52s]  How much do I have?
[11255.52s -> 11260.13s]  17, 40 seconds.
[11267.08s -> 11274.31s]  Also, we need a platform that goes from left to right.
[11275.19s -> 11276.55s]  Very far distance down here,
[11276.55s -> 11277.91s]  but we can fight the wall with flesh.
[11277.91s -> 11278.71s]  I have like 20.
[11278.71s -> 11280.71s]  I'm not like going to risk going down there anymore.
[11282.31s -> 11287.33s]  What's that?
[11293.97s -> 11294.53s]  Some in there.
[11294.53s -> 11295.57s]  I'm not opening that up.
[11295.57s -> 11297.33s]  I'll just drown.
[11297.33s -> 11300.53s]  Work on operation left and right platform.
[11300.53s -> 11301.64s]  Okay.
[11301.64s -> 11303.00s]  Like towards where you are now?
[11305.28s -> 11307.12s]  Either direction works, honestly.
[11307.12s -> 11308.72s]  I don't think I don't have any like wood with me.
[11309.68s -> 11313.32s]  Can I not fly down here?
[11314.12s -> 11315.40s]  Or do I have to be running to fly?
[11318.48s -> 11319.44s]  You should be able to fly.
[11328.48s -> 11329.44s]  Old face?
[11329.44s -> 11330.08s]  What the fuck?
[11331.03s -> 11331.67s]  Yeah, I was holding it.
[11331.67s -> 11332.15s]  That was weird.
[11333.91s -> 11335.19s]  I have to hit it a third time.
[11335.19s -> 11335.51s]  Okay.
[11339.03s -> 11339.27s]  All right.
[11341.67s -> 11343.27s]  How safe is it over to you right now?
[11343.27s -> 11344.31s]  I can't really tell.
[11344.31s -> 11344.79s]  It's safe.
[11345.67s -> 11347.60s]  I've got platforms starting to go this way.
[11348.40s -> 11351.59s]  I'm afraid I need this lava and shit.
[11358.15s -> 11358.79s]  Oh, no.
[11361.32s -> 11362.20s]  Not the lava.
[11363.00s -> 11363.86s]  Okay.
[11364.42s -> 11365.64s]  I am coming over there.
[11366.60s -> 11369.00s]  I'm assuming you already got all these chests, right?
[11370.64s -> 11372.16s]  No, we can't open those.
[11372.16s -> 11375.41s]  We can't open these unless you have a shadow key.
[11375.41s -> 11379.01s]  I remembered getting a shadow key, but I like don't have a character.
[11379.01s -> 11380.21s]  We don't have one in our stash.
[11381.17s -> 11382.69s]  But you need a shadow key to open these.
[11383.33s -> 11384.69s]  I swear we got one, though.
[11385.49s -> 11388.45s]  I'm swearing it so hard.
[11388.45s -> 11389.73s]  I'm swearing it.
[11390.37s -> 11390.77s]  All right.
[11392.85s -> 11394.42s]  Obsidian door.
[11395.46s -> 11397.00s]  Oh, my God.
[11397.00s -> 11397.56s]  What have I done?
[11398.12s -> 11399.67s]  It's okay.
[11400.47s -> 11402.31s]  There was like lava.
[11402.31s -> 11404.15s]  There was lava like in the room.
[11404.15s -> 11405.83s]  Did you like pull a little lava in here?
[11406.31s -> 11409.19s]  The lava slimes.
[11411.75s -> 11413.03s]  You give me all the health you got?
[11413.67s -> 11414.23s]  Yes, I will.
[11414.87s -> 11415.35s]  Here you go.
[11416.07s -> 11424.21s]  I'm assuming we're going to fight something down here.
[11424.21s -> 11426.13s]  If I were betting on it.
[11429.48s -> 11429.64s]  Yeah.
[11430.28s -> 11433.86s]  So do not.
[11433.86s -> 11436.34s]  Last time I opened one of these chests, our game's froze.
[11436.34s -> 11436.98s]  So we cannot.
[11436.98s -> 11438.02s]  There's no way to open them.
[11438.02s -> 11439.46s]  We need like special keys or something, right?
[11440.18s -> 11440.90s]  We need a key.
[11442.18s -> 11445.36s]  Did you say you're going to give me a platform?
[11445.36s -> 11445.76s]  Yeah, come here.
[11454.05s -> 11456.93s]  We want it to be at one level, not like multiple levels.
[11456.93s -> 11458.61s]  So just like going in a straight line.
[11458.61s -> 11459.17s]  Okay.
[11459.17s -> 11460.29s]  Do you want me to go the other way?
[11460.29s -> 11461.81s]  Do you want me to just keep going with you this way?
[11462.61s -> 11464.40s]  Like, do you want me to like?
[11465.12s -> 11466.48s]  Let's just both go the same direction.
[11466.48s -> 11467.12s]  The same direction.
[11469.96s -> 11471.08s]  Did you get me to play?
[11471.08s -> 11471.96s]  You did, you did.
[11471.96s -> 11473.64s]  You would platform this.
[11473.64s -> 11486.92s]  Ay, ya, ya.
[11486.92s -> 11487.80s]  Ay, ya, ya.
[11488.52s -> 11499.68s]  So, all right, you can just let it drop here.
[11501.28s -> 11501.92s]  Walk across.
[11505.35s -> 11509.43s]  There is a thing that will come at you and it will move towards you forever.
[11509.51s -> 11510.79s]  And you can't go behind it.
[11511.51s -> 11514.07s]  So you need a lot of like backing up space.
[11514.63s -> 11516.10s]  Okay.
[11516.10s -> 11518.50s]  There's like a flame wall or something that comes over here.
[11519.88s -> 11520.92s]  A flesh wall.
[11521.88s -> 11523.08s]  It's the wall of flesh.
[11523.08s -> 11525.32s]  It's the actual wall of flesh.
[11526.12s -> 11527.40s]  Yeah, it's not just nicknames.
[11528.84s -> 11530.36s]  That's its real name.
[11530.36s -> 11531.16s]  That's what it is.
[11531.16s -> 11533.64s]  That's not like what they call me when I go to the gym or anything.
[11541.83s -> 11543.43s]  I'm going to make sure I have my summons.
[11543.43s -> 11547.40s]  Guys, I'm frickin' ready.
[11547.40s -> 11548.44s]  Can you like do something?
[11549.00s -> 11550.92s]  I thought, well, I was waiting to see what...
[11551.64s -> 11553.11s]  I don't know, I've never done this before.
[11553.11s -> 11554.31s]  I don't know how far we need to go.
[11555.19s -> 11556.07s]  Very far.
[11556.07s -> 11556.79s]  Very far.
[11557.51s -> 11558.55s]  Very far.
[11558.55s -> 11567.28s]  I thought we were working together, you know?
[11567.92s -> 11592.05s]  Hey, I didn't do that.
[11593.25s -> 11594.29s]  That was you who did.
[11595.01s -> 11604.44s]  Okay, so just keep going.
[11605.32s -> 11607.06s]  Let's just keep on.
[11607.06s -> 11608.58s]  We should actually go the other direction.
[11608.58s -> 11609.78s]  Because this is where we come down.
[11610.50s -> 11620.93s]  Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
[11621.01s -> 11621.97s]  That's way easier.
[11624.16s -> 11624.66s]  Yep.
[11626.34s -> 11628.58s]  Somebody gave $50 to you.
[11628.58s -> 11630.10s]  They said, hey, stirrer, thanks for the stream.
[11630.10s -> 11630.82s]  It's been hilarious.
[11630.82s -> 11632.42s]  This German guy's kind of a psycho.
[11632.42s -> 11632.92s]  LOL.
[11633.70s -> 11636.66s]  That was from Shining Path.
[11637.84s -> 11638.34s]  Nice.
[11639.04s -> 11642.58s]  Yeah, I mean, thank you, Shining Path.
[11642.58s -> 11644.26s]  For the $50, by the way.
[11650.40s -> 11652.39s]  That's a lot of fucking money.
[11652.39s -> 11652.89s]  Thank you.
[11653.27s -> 11654.56s]  To star.
[11654.56s -> 11655.36s]  Thank you.
[11655.36s -> 11656.40s]  Thank you to star.
[11656.40s -> 11657.12s]  Yeah, no problem.
[11657.12s -> 11658.80s]  I mean, like, I'm the highlight of the stream.
[11659.76s -> 11665.44s]  You know, I'm like, I'm like woke.
[11670.36s -> 11671.40s]  Oh, come on.
[11671.40s -> 11672.52s]  Really? You knocked it over.
[11675.43s -> 11676.07s]  Oh, my God.
[11678.07s -> 11679.91s]  Is this truly the legendary blade?
[11682.96s -> 11685.52s]  Like, I have such shit weapons this whole game.
[11685.52s -> 11686.96s]  I'm going to probably going to need something better.
[11692.37s -> 11693.73s]  This thing ain't good.
[11693.73s -> 11701.62s]  No, it's not.
[11701.62s -> 11703.38s]  Did they kill the wall of flesh yet?
[11703.38s -> 11703.88s]  That's a...
[11704.87s -> 11705.67s]  That's a question.
[11705.67s -> 11706.47s]  I'm almost out of...
[11706.47s -> 11709.67s]  I'm out of, um, platform.
[11709.67s -> 11710.55s]  I got no more.
[11712.18s -> 11712.68s]  Here.
[11713.46s -> 11713.96s]  Take.
[11715.09s -> 11715.65s]  Thanks.
[11715.65s -> 11716.21s]  Keep going.
[11716.21s -> 11716.93s]  I'll defend you.
[11717.49s -> 11718.53s]  I'll put that to good use.
[11719.17s -> 11733.84s]  I should make a funny trap so when he comes over here one time,
[11733.84s -> 11735.28s]  he'll fall in when we fight the boss.
[11735.28s -> 11741.83s]  So, um, this is activating hard mode, essentially, after this.
[11742.63s -> 11746.40s]  It's like the final thing you do before it becomes hard mode.
[11747.12s -> 11749.81s]  You don't even know what that means.
[11750.37s -> 11751.09s]  I don't.
[11751.09s -> 11753.01s]  I mean, I know it just means the game is hard or no.
[11755.91s -> 11756.47s]  Don't do it.
[11756.47s -> 11757.19s]  Don't do it.
[11757.19s -> 11757.67s]  Don't do it.
[11757.67s -> 11758.23s]  What are you talking about?
[11761.73s -> 11762.29s]  What is going on?
[11763.01s -> 11772.61s]  Uh, don't touch...
[11772.61s -> 11774.13s]  That ground will hurt you.
[11774.13s -> 11775.65s]  So just be sure you don't stand on it.
[11775.65s -> 11776.15s]  Yeah.
[11780.24s -> 11782.00s]  Uh, you keep doing what you're doing.
[11783.17s -> 11783.81s]  I'll be back.
[11784.45s -> 11787.01s]  I'm gonna try and make this bow before we fight it
[11787.01s -> 11789.41s]  because my weapons have been garbage this whole game.
[11791.68s -> 11793.04s]  And, you know, I'm just kind of sick of it.
[11793.84s -> 11797.52s]  I feel like I deserve happiness as much as anyone else.
[11797.52s -> 11799.92s]  How come I keep putting myself before other people?
[11799.92s -> 11801.04s]  Is this lava ever gonna go away?
[11801.76s -> 11805.08s]  I'm trying to, like, drop it.
[11805.88s -> 11809.09s]  Hey, look at that.
[11826.64s -> 11828.24s]  This feels so odd doing this.
[11829.36s -> 11830.56s]  I'm out of platforms again.
[11831.46s -> 11832.82s]  Oh, well...
[11832.82s -> 11833.94s]  I've gone all the way over here.
[11835.70s -> 11838.82s]  It's also better if you do it with, uh, just, like, bricks.
[11838.82s -> 11841.38s]  So if you have any random bricks, like dirt or something.
[11841.38s -> 11842.26s]  I mean, I have, like...
[11842.98s -> 11844.26s]  I have obsidian brick.
[11845.22s -> 11845.94s]  Yeah.
[11845.94s -> 11846.58s]  Just go for it.
[11846.58s -> 11847.38s]  Go wild.
[11847.38s -> 11848.58s]  Just do it with a brick?
[11849.54s -> 11852.79s]  Will it be, like, on the same plane?
[11854.23s -> 11854.87s]  I guess so.
[11855.75s -> 11859.09s]  I didn't know if it, like, caught the top of the, um...
[11859.09s -> 11862.74s]  The lip of the wood, like, the platforms.
[11863.38s -> 11863.86s]  What?
[11863.86s -> 11866.61s]  Can I just make obsidian platforms right now?
[11866.61s -> 11867.41s]  Oh, fuck.
[11867.41s -> 11868.05s]  Yeah, you can.
[11868.05s -> 11868.61s]  Just go.
[11868.61s -> 11869.81s]  Oh, just go, just go.
[11870.85s -> 11877.78s]  Just go!
[11877.78s -> 11879.30s]  I'm do- I'm going.
[11879.78s -> 11885.25s]  What are you waiting around for?
[11885.89s -> 11886.61s]  I'm not.
[11888.79s -> 11889.43s]  I just touched.
[11889.43s -> 11889.99s]  Ow.
[11889.99s -> 11893.19s]  Somebody just threw, like, a fucking boomerang at me.
[11894.15s -> 11895.19s]  Kill this guy!
[11895.19s -> 11895.75s]  Not you.
[11895.75s -> 11896.95s]  My- my minions!
[11896.95s -> 11898.15s]  They're just hanging out in here.
[11898.71s -> 11899.75s]  What are you guys doing?
[11900.07s -> 11902.45s]  What are you guys doing?
[11905.17s -> 11906.45s]  They've- they've trapped themselves.
[11907.17s -> 11907.73s]  All right, I need to...
[11908.61s -> 11913.57s]  Oh, you idiots.
[11919.56s -> 11920.92s]  I'm on new minions now.
[11921.56s -> 11922.66s]  You guys blew it.
[11924.66s -> 11925.86s]  Uh, once we go into hard mode,
[11925.86s -> 11928.58s]  we can actually get you, like, an absurdly overpowered...
[11929.62s -> 11930.34s]  Minion.
[11930.34s -> 11930.84s]  Really?
[11931.54s -> 11932.18s]  Yeah.
[11932.18s -> 11936.02s]  It- it will, like, autopilot the rest of the game for you
[11936.02s -> 11937.22s]  for, like, a long time.
[11937.22s -> 11939.06s]  If you- you're into that sort of thing.
[11939.06s -> 11942.36s]  It tracks minions through walls,
[11942.36s -> 11944.28s]  like, very slightly off your screen.
[11944.28s -> 11945.40s]  It just kills everything.
[11946.04s -> 11946.92s]  Really?
[11946.92s -> 11948.12s]  It's nuts, yeah.
[11948.12s -> 11950.36s]  I feel like that's- would that be fun, though?
[11952.07s -> 11953.03s]  I used to use it.
[11953.03s -> 11953.67s]  It was kind of fun.
[11954.47s -> 11956.23s]  I mean, it's, like, fun to not be annoyed.
[11957.03s -> 11961.38s]  Oh, there's a new one.
[11962.02s -> 11962.66s]  What is it?
[11962.66s -> 11969.25s]  Um, what's the matter?
[11969.25s -> 11969.65s]  Nothing.
[11969.65s -> 11970.45s]  Nothing's the matter.
[11971.33s -> 11974.40s]  You're doing great, honey.
[11974.40s -> 11975.04s]  Thanks.
[11975.04s -> 11976.64s]  I need to fight a boss.
[11976.64s -> 11977.60s]  What's the matter, actually?
[11978.32s -> 11979.28s]  Any more demonite?
[11979.84s -> 11984.82s]  I'm almost out of, I think, ways to make platforms.
[11988.34s -> 11988.82s]  Frog.
[11989.46s -> 11990.02s]  Uh, star.
[11990.02s -> 11992.90s]  I'm- I'm almost out of, uh, platforms.
[12010.02s -> 12011.49s]  I'm fucking busy.
[12012.05s -> 12023.41s]  Okay.
[12024.13s -> 12025.25s]  That's what I got.
[12025.25s -> 12027.97s]  I do have- I have, uh, ash blocks?
[12027.97s -> 12028.61s]  Can I make, like...
[12029.73s -> 12030.85s]  Yeah, that works.
[12030.85s -> 12031.49s]  That works, too?
[12031.49s -> 12032.13s]  They're not gonna fall?
[12033.01s -> 12033.51s]  Mm-mm.
[12034.21s -> 12037.60s]  It's, like, silt and sand, that fall.
[12046.15s -> 12047.03s]  Oh, my God.
[12047.03s -> 12048.87s]  These guys are throwing the fucking boomerangs.
[12050.21s -> 12051.25s]  Where are my friends?
[12051.89s -> 12057.64s]  I thought I could trust you guys.
[12062.77s -> 12063.81s]  Why didn't they come here?
[12063.81s -> 12067.08s]  Oh, fucking idiot.
[12073.28s -> 12075.04s]  Oh, you guys are dunking into the water.
[12075.76s -> 12077.19s]  The very hot water.
[12077.91s -> 12079.11s]  To kill the worm.
[12079.11s -> 12079.75s]  I get it now.
[12081.20s -> 12082.48s]  Eater of worlds has awoken.
[12084.63s -> 12085.13s]  Star?
[12085.83s -> 12086.33s]  Yeah?
[12087.73s -> 12088.45s]  Uh, boss.
[12088.45s -> 12089.49s]  We already fought this boss.
[12089.49s -> 12091.17s]  I just need more resource.
[12093.11s -> 12094.39s]  From which side?
[12096.07s -> 12097.59s]  Just comes up and swallows me.
[12098.15s -> 12099.59s]  Like the big fish in Mario.
[12105.40s -> 12106.44s]  Is there- why is it-
[12106.44s -> 12107.96s]  Is there a reason why this says 8 a.m.?
[12113.49s -> 12114.37s]  8 a.m., no.
[12115.17s -> 12117.49s]  I am officially out of materials.
[12119.01s -> 12120.37s]  Besides, like, uh, yeah.
[12120.37s -> 12122.21s]  I have no more, like, materials to keep this going.
[12124.15s -> 12124.65s]  Okay.
[12125.51s -> 12126.23s]  Back to town.
[12127.32s -> 12128.12s]  It might be enough.
[12128.12s -> 12129.72s]  I think we're pretty- I'm pretty buff.
[12132.13s -> 12135.73s]  Normally you can kill wall of flesh if you just walk backwards and throw dynamite on the ground.
[12137.03s -> 12141.35s]  Which, dynamite falls through platforms, so we can't really do that in all the spots.
[12141.35s -> 12143.51s]  I'm just testing my work to make sure we can go right through it.
[12144.63s -> 12147.11s]  We just need to walk- run backwards, right?
[12148.15s -> 12148.65s]  Yeah.
[12149.70s -> 12152.50s]  Because I'm just making sure that there's plenty of space, there's no holes.
[12153.70s -> 12154.82s]  You know, I'm just checking my work.
[12158.87s -> 12159.59s]  It's pretty good.
[12161.68s -> 12164.24s]  She seems like there's- wait, there's a hole right there!
[12164.32s -> 12164.96s]  Aha!
[12164.96s -> 12166.32s]  This is why you check your work!
[12167.36s -> 12170.80s]  The, um, sometimes the lava slimes will create lava when you kill them,
[12170.80s -> 12172.80s]  and they'll, like, rip a hole in the platform.
[12172.80s -> 12173.76s]  This is why you check your work.
[12176.23s -> 12177.03s]  Okay.
[12177.03s -> 12180.68s]  I think, uh, I'm- so I'm just gonna come back to you.
[12183.17s -> 12185.01s]  That sounds- that sounds great.
[12186.53s -> 12189.06s]  Hello.
[12190.08s -> 12190.64s]  What do we got?
[12190.64s -> 12191.14s]  Hey.
[12191.44s -> 12196.32s]  I need those potions.
[12198.92s -> 12200.93s]  A lot of apples.
[12200.93s -> 12202.53s]  Fuck, I sold that.
[12202.53s -> 12203.57s]  Oh, come on.
[12204.45s -> 12208.79s]  Is it raining presents?
[12209.51s -> 12211.76s]  Okay, I don't need it.
[12211.76s -> 12213.76s]  It's raining presents from the sky.
[12213.76s -> 12217.76s]  Yeah, it's raining, um, slimes that are dying and turning into presents.
[12218.40s -> 12218.80s]  What?
[12218.80s -> 12219.44s]  That's awesome!
[12221.64s -> 12224.28s]  Sometimes during this, uh, slime king appearance.
[12224.28s -> 12225.80s]  Oh, does he?
[12225.80s -> 12226.30s]  That's cool.
[12229.70s -> 12231.06s]  Uh, can I have that bee bow?
[12231.86s -> 12233.16s]  Yes.
[12233.16s -> 12234.44s]  Yes, you can have the bee bow.
[12235.56s -> 12238.74s]  Don't you just love beemo?
[12240.02s -> 12241.70s]  I- I don't know.
[12241.70s -> 12242.20s]  What is that?
[12243.40s -> 12244.52s]  Uh, bee bow.
[12246.39s -> 12248.23s]  You need the bee arrows.
[12249.03s -> 12249.59s]  No.
[12249.59s -> 12250.09s]  Okay.
[12259.67s -> 12261.11s]  Even more people have shown up.
[12263.01s -> 12264.13s]  God damn it.
[12265.80s -> 12268.20s]  Oh, what a pain in the ass this is becoming.
[12268.20s -> 12270.44s]  I got- okay, go back to the corruption.
[12271.08s -> 12272.10s]  Christmas hats?
[12287.44s -> 12289.83s]  All right, um, potions.
[12289.83s -> 12299.20s]  I want to bring out my life regen speed ones.
[12300.00s -> 12303.73s]  You already have the materials.
[12304.61s -> 12305.11s]  Yeah?
[12305.97s -> 12311.51s]  Get some of that bacon out here.
[12312.47s -> 12330.64s]  I think I'm good, right?
[12330.64s -> 12337.68s]  I got life regen, summoning ability, defense, movement speed, oh, and mana regen.
[12343.25s -> 12349.28s]  Um, fuck, dude.
[12349.28s -> 12351.76s]  If you could figure out how to make a kiln, that would really help.
[12352.40s -> 12353.38s]  What?
[12353.38s -> 12356.50s]  What's with this, like, social network website spam?
[12357.92s -> 12358.42s]  What?
[12358.42s -> 12360.48s]  Say that again, sorry, people are going insane.
[12361.76s -> 12366.48s]  I said if you found out how to make a kiln, that would really help.
[12366.48s -> 12366.98s]  A kiln?
[12367.94s -> 12370.58s]  Yeah, it's like, I think it uses lead and I don't know what else.
[12373.00s -> 12373.64s]  Kiln?
[12373.64s -> 12374.44s]  Anybody understand?
[12375.08s -> 12376.20s]  Looking for how to make a kiln.
[12381.34s -> 12385.18s]  Um, it is 18 iron bars and eight torches.
[12386.06s -> 12387.26s]  I don't know if we have enough iron.
[12388.78s -> 12389.28s]  Let's see.
[12389.82s -> 12392.38s]  I have seven, it's lead for us.
[12392.38s -> 12393.18s]  Oh, lead.
[12393.18s -> 12395.50s]  Uh, there's no lead in the box.
[12396.38s -> 12397.10s]  God damn it.
[12397.10s -> 12398.22s]  King Slime?
[12398.22s -> 12398.70s]  Is he?
[12398.70s -> 12399.42s]  Oh, King Slime.
[12399.98s -> 12400.48s]  Yeah.
[12403.02s -> 12404.38s]  He's in, oh no, he's inside.
[12404.38s -> 12405.98s]  He's inside, he's killing, people are dead.
[12405.98s -> 12407.50s]  He's killing people, people are gonna die.
[12411.24s -> 12414.04s]  All right, well, like, what kind of panicking asshole am I?
[12414.84s -> 12417.08s]  I'm just standing outside watching him kill everybody.
[12417.08s -> 12419.72s]  Uh, he's killing people, he's, he's, he's killing people inside.
[12421.72s -> 12422.92s]  I'm witnessing a murder.
[12422.92s -> 12424.36s]  I mean, he's murdering people.
[12425.96s -> 12428.16s]  I feel like I've got something I should do.
[12429.28s -> 12430.89s]  All right, he's dead.
[12430.89s -> 12434.09s]  Oh, you should be able to get that rideable slime that I had that you were jealous of,
[12434.09s -> 12436.17s]  but you're not jealous of anymore because you have a frog.
[12437.48s -> 12442.03s]  Yeah, let's see what I got.
[12444.94s -> 12445.90s]  I'm on the phone with you.
[12448.04s -> 12452.44s]  Slime just teleported inside and I'm out here right now, man, and it is wild.
[12453.31s -> 12454.75s]  They look just like people.
[12455.63s -> 12460.89s]  So what happens if he, okay, what happens if somebody in here dies?
[12462.51s -> 12465.63s]  Then they're dead and they respawn after like a day or two.
[12466.68s -> 12469.56s]  You get like a new guy with a new name that does the same job.
[12469.56s -> 12473.50s]  Oh, solidifier.
[12474.72s -> 12476.40s]  You know, you're all replaceable.
[12477.24s -> 12478.52s]  You think slime hook.
[12478.52s -> 12479.48s]  We need you.
[12479.48s -> 12482.92s]  You know how many people want this passion job you're done for.
[12483.88s -> 12485.32s]  I got a slime hook now.
[12485.32s -> 12489.48s]  Oh, I think that one is like a triple gooper.
[12491.29s -> 12491.69s]  Is it?
[12492.33s -> 12495.05s]  Yeah, like it attaches multiple times.
[12495.05s -> 12497.02s]  I think so.
[12497.02s -> 12508.33s]  It doesn't look like it's doing anything different.
[12511.50s -> 12513.18s]  While you're attached, trying to shoot it again.
[12515.10s -> 12517.26s]  Whoa, whoa, Spider-Man.
[12523.16s -> 12525.16s]  Oh, our merchant fucking died, didn't he?
[12525.16s -> 12527.56s]  I need like for the first time ever, I needed him.
[12529.08s -> 12530.28s]  Oh, no, nobody died.
[12530.28s -> 12530.76s]  Who died?
[12531.40s -> 12533.53s]  Who died?
[12536.32s -> 12537.76s]  The merchant used to be right there.
[12537.76s -> 12538.64s]  What do you mean the merchant?
[12539.44s -> 12541.34s]  They got a guy with a beard.
[12541.34s -> 12542.62s]  Oh, he's over here now.
[12542.62s -> 12543.26s]  Ralph.
[12543.26s -> 12544.54s]  He died a while ago.
[12544.54s -> 12546.68s]  All right.
[12546.68s -> 12547.88s]  These guys are fucking annoying.
[12547.88s -> 12548.36s]  Not even him.
[12549.08s -> 12550.52s]  Who sells like good arrows?
[12552.72s -> 12553.60s]  Odd Michael over here.
[12556.49s -> 12557.29s]  Is that for real?
[12558.57s -> 12559.21s]  Odd Michael.
[12560.36s -> 12561.16s]  Odd Michael.
[12565.61s -> 12565.93s]  All right.
[12565.93s -> 12568.49s]  I got technique hidden blade.
[12572.51s -> 12573.23s]  Throwing class.
[12574.27s -> 12575.71s]  I'm irrelevant to you.
[12575.71s -> 12576.91s]  Okay, ninja hood.
[12578.56s -> 12579.36s]  Relevant, right?
[12580.24s -> 12580.48s]  Yeah.
[12581.44s -> 12582.88s]  A bottle of water.
[12582.88s -> 12583.68s]  Whatever this is.
[12583.68s -> 12584.88s]  Blue slime banner.
[12587.24s -> 12588.52s]  Shinobi slicer.
[12589.32s -> 12592.32s]  Just putting it in.
[12594.11s -> 12594.67s]  Ruby hook.
[12595.39s -> 12598.96s]  Going in.
[12598.96s -> 12599.60s]  Mining potion.
[12599.60s -> 12600.64s]  I don't want that.
[12600.64s -> 12603.56s]  Do you think I am auto-trashing?
[12604.28s -> 12609.23s]  No, it's just Jester.
[12609.95s -> 12613.55s]  Like shouldn't someone be selling Jester out?
[12613.55s -> 12614.11s]  Jester.
[12614.11s -> 12615.95s]  I feel like that's really familiar.
[12616.91s -> 12620.43s]  Or hellfire or something like just something better than wood.
[12626.60s -> 12628.60s]  Or do I craft with wood arrows?
[12628.60s -> 12633.95s]  All right.
[12633.95s -> 12635.39s]  Let me see what I can do here.
[12635.39s -> 12636.59s]  I got six presents.
[12645.20s -> 12647.92s]  Is anything actually good come out of these presents or never?
[12647.92s -> 12650.16s]  Is it just like a thing for fun for Christmas time?
[12651.92s -> 12655.52s]  I think it actually has seasonal events and something like there's Halloween items.
[12658.41s -> 12659.93s]  But no, they're not really good.
[12659.93s -> 12665.13s]  I know if during Halloween there's like costumes I can give you.
[12665.13s -> 12668.33s]  Yeah, I mean I got like the Santa Claus outfit.
[12673.24s -> 12673.56s]  All right.
[12673.56s -> 12675.08s]  Are we going to attempt the wall?
[12677.15s -> 12678.99s]  Let me make some arrows.
[12678.99s -> 12689.34s]  We're going for a wall attempt.
[12690.46s -> 12690.94s]  Possibly.
[12694.12s -> 12694.92s]  No, my computer.
[12705.04s -> 12706.00s]  That was almost an F.
[12707.28s -> 12707.76s]  It was.
[12708.48s -> 12708.96s]  Almost.
[12709.92s -> 12720.20s]  Oh, money.
[12720.20s -> 12721.56s]  This is just lava down here.
[12721.56s -> 12723.00s]  Did a lava slime die down here?
[12723.00s -> 12723.72s]  Is that what this is?
[12724.68s -> 12733.69s]  What are you up to?
[12735.31s -> 12736.19s]  Buying arrows.
[12736.83s -> 12740.99s]  No, it's honey.
[12740.99s -> 12741.47s]  Stand in it.
[12758.65s -> 12760.89s]  So what's the basic rundown?
[12760.89s -> 12762.57s]  Blood moon is rising.
[12762.57s -> 12764.17s]  Well, now we're stuck here.
[12764.17s -> 12764.97s]  Just ignore it.
[12764.97s -> 12766.09s]  You don't have to stay here.
[12776.35s -> 12777.79s]  Oh, fuck, dude.
[12779.50s -> 12782.62s]  Dude, the streamer looks really cute.
[12783.42s -> 12783.66s]  Hey.
[12784.62s -> 12785.63s]  Hey, cool.
[12785.63s -> 12786.03s]  Thank you.
[12787.74s -> 12789.84s]  Oh, he thought it was for him.
[12791.37s -> 12792.33s]  Well, it should be.
[12792.33s -> 12793.93s]  It's in my chat room.
[12795.29s -> 12799.53s]  I thought it was that each chat is for the other person.
[12799.53s -> 12802.09s]  That's why, like, you get the $50 for me.
[12802.09s -> 12802.65s]  Oh, right.
[12805.16s -> 12806.76s]  We both don't have face cams.
[12806.76s -> 12806.92s]  No.
[12811.02s -> 12811.98s]  No, we do not.
[12811.98s -> 12823.05s]  A lot of stuff out here.
[12823.05s -> 12828.01s]  I can't just leave without picking up this stuff.
[12829.82s -> 12830.78s]  Even if it's worthless.
[12834.14s -> 12834.54s]  Nice.
[12835.10s -> 12836.30s]  I need more hellstone.
[12836.30s -> 12837.10s]  God damn it.
[12837.10s -> 12837.58s]  Wait, no.
[12838.46s -> 12839.42s]  I shouldn't.
[12839.42s -> 12840.30s]  I need obsidian.
[12840.30s -> 12843.02s]  That's what I need to make hellstone.
[12843.98s -> 12844.70s]  I want to do that.
[12845.26s -> 12856.92s]  How much do I have to pay?
[12856.92s -> 12857.16s]  No.
[12858.28s -> 12859.00s]  Are we winning?
[12860.51s -> 12860.99s]  Get in there.
[12865.13s -> 12866.81s]  We've paid 700 times already.
[12866.81s -> 12867.61s]  You just missed it.
[12868.41s -> 12875.90s]  Free stuff on the roof.
[12875.90s -> 12876.86s]  Free stuff on the roof.
[12877.58s -> 12887.10s]  He's in there crafting.
[12888.91s -> 12889.79s]  Crafting.
[12892.40s -> 12894.48s]  He's down there crafting.
[12895.36s -> 12896.08s]  All right.
[12896.08s -> 12897.12s]  Are we doing this now?
[12897.84s -> 12899.12s]  Are we actually doing this?
[12899.12s -> 12901.44s]  I need like two seconds to grab obsidian.
[12901.44s -> 12903.44s]  Can you give me like two seconds?
[12904.40s -> 12908.73s]  Or you can help me get obsidian.
[12908.73s -> 12910.01s]  Like contribute.
[12910.81s -> 12913.82s]  I don't know, dude.
[12914.54s -> 12917.08s]  I don't know, man.
[12917.80s -> 12920.38s]  I'm currently fighting blood.
[12923.98s -> 12926.86s]  It's not like I'm having fun getting obsidian down here.
[12926.86s -> 12927.58s]  That's kind of cool.
[12927.58s -> 12928.38s]  That's kind of good.
[12928.38s -> 12928.86s]  Wait a minute.
[12929.66s -> 12932.78s]  So that's five defense.
[12934.41s -> 12934.89s]  Wait a minute.
[12945.47s -> 12946.48s]  All right.
[12946.48s -> 12947.44s]  I'm just going to come down to you.
[12948.48s -> 12949.28s]  Okay.
[12949.28s -> 12950.48s]  I guess we can fight this.
[12950.48s -> 12951.28s]  Are we going to try this?
[12951.28s -> 12951.84s]  Be able to do it.
[12953.96s -> 12955.80s]  Go into the stash before you come down
[12955.80s -> 12959.08s]  because I don't have a return way yet.
[12960.68s -> 12962.20s]  Because I don't have a glass kiln.
[12964.60s -> 12966.60s]  So you would like me to remove what from the stash?
[12967.64s -> 12968.36s]  Voodoo doll.
[12971.32s -> 12974.44s]  We have a guide voodoo doll and a clothier voodoo doll.
[12974.44s -> 12975.72s]  Guide is what we need.
[12975.72s -> 12976.44s]  Just want one.
[12979.08s -> 12979.56s]  Just one.
[12980.60s -> 12981.16s]  Okay.
[12981.16s -> 12981.72s]  Anything else?
[12983.24s -> 12984.92s]  That is it.
[12984.92s -> 12986.12s]  Oh, obsidian potions.
[12986.12s -> 12987.56s]  And obsidian potions.
[12988.52s -> 12992.62s]  I'll make sure not to drink two of them.
[12992.62s -> 12994.30s]  I'm just going to buy them.
[12994.30s -> 12994.86s]  Do I have money?
[12996.78s -> 12999.16s]  I know I keep putting money in here.
[12999.16s -> 13002.97s]  So what do you think?
[13002.97s -> 13003.85s]  Four obsidian potions?
[13005.87s -> 13006.35s]  Just two.
[13007.84s -> 13010.32s]  We either die or we don't right now.
[13010.32s -> 13010.64s]  Okay.
[13010.64s -> 13011.76s]  Either die or we don't.
[13011.76s -> 13012.16s]  You got it.
[13018.46s -> 13020.38s]  Make sure you touch the summoning thing.
[13020.38s -> 13020.94s]  Yeah, I am.
[13021.84s -> 13024.96s]  And have a weapon that can attack at range.
[13025.84s -> 13027.23s]  That's kind of all I have.
[13028.73s -> 13031.93s]  Can you actually grab me the summon that skull
[13031.93s -> 13033.53s]  that you were using before that you didn't like?
[13035.28s -> 13036.72s]  The minotaur skull?
[13037.60s -> 13039.68s]  I can't- the weapon that shot the laser.
[13041.08s -> 13042.84s]  Weapon that shot the- oh no, I'm using that.
[13043.80s -> 13044.36s]  Oh, you are?
[13044.36s -> 13045.08s]  Yeah, I am using that.
[13045.08s -> 13046.36s]  I thought you said you didn't like it.
[13046.36s -> 13048.52s]  I don't like it, but it's doing more damage than what I have, so.
[13049.32s -> 13049.82s]  Okay.
[13050.52s -> 13051.88s]  Well, then yeah, you can come down here.
[13053.50s -> 13054.00s]  Okay.
[13057.72s -> 13058.44s]  I'm coming.
[13069.56s -> 13071.32s]  Oh, it's a- why did I save her?
[13073.56s -> 13074.06s]  Shit.
[13075.80s -> 13077.48s]  I didn't know who it was and I clicked on her
[13077.48s -> 13078.28s]  and then I should have known.
[13082.28s -> 13083.88s]  So is there a certain thing we do to summon this thing?
[13085.90s -> 13086.40s]  Yes.
[13086.94s -> 13087.26s]  Cool.
[13087.26s -> 13088.78s]  Let me break it down like this.
[13088.78s -> 13089.34s]  Break it down.
[13091.58s -> 13093.18s]  Which button do I have to press?
[13096.51s -> 13098.19s]  Nine, one, one.
[13098.99s -> 13100.78s]  Let me show off what I'm like.
[13101.58s -> 13102.62s]  You are down here.
[13103.50s -> 13105.66s]  Come all the way to the right.
[13105.66s -> 13106.16s]  Yes.
[13106.88s -> 13125.28s]  Coming.
[13127.74s -> 13136.38s]  That sounds like you're stepping in snow.
[13136.38s -> 13137.10s]  I like this sound.
[13139.15s -> 13139.65s]  Ow.
[13140.27s -> 13142.27s]  Dude, this is actually so good.
[13142.99s -> 13145.12s]  Who the fuck is this?
[13145.68s -> 13146.96s]  No, that's yo-yo, never mind.
[13148.26s -> 13148.82s]  What'd you just drop?
[13149.78s -> 13150.74s]  Vanquisher medal?
[13151.87s -> 13152.67s]  Ignore it.
[13152.67s -> 13162.35s]  Oh, okay.
[13162.35s -> 13163.07s]  So, um.
[13166.51s -> 13168.27s]  I think this might need to be longer.
[13169.23s -> 13169.73s]  Longer?
[13170.83s -> 13171.33s]  Yeah.
[13172.51s -> 13173.55s]  I'm concerned.
[13176.66s -> 13177.16s]  All right.
[13177.56s -> 13180.12s]  Grats on 150 health bat kills.
[13180.12s -> 13180.62s]  Thank you.
[13181.24s -> 13184.12s]  You're still not at 400 health, are you?
[13184.12s -> 13184.62s]  No.
[13184.68s -> 13185.18s]  350.
[13189.28s -> 13191.44s]  I didn't bring any building materials or anything.
[13195.81s -> 13197.17s]  This is still not long enough?
[13201.17s -> 13202.85s]  How long does this gotta be?
[13202.85s -> 13204.13s]  It might be, but I want to be sure.
[13204.13s -> 13206.37s]  Because if you reach the end and the boss isn't dead yet,
[13206.37s -> 13209.01s]  then you're like in a panic jumping over lava pits and stuff.
[13209.81s -> 13212.37s]  And like trying to work your way through houses while it kills you.
[13213.25s -> 13216.26s]  Well, I'm just gonna start grabbing material then.
[13220.21s -> 13221.97s]  Either it's long enough or it isn't.
[13221.97s -> 13222.47s]  Yeah.
[13224.88s -> 13227.04s]  And I'd rather it be long enough, you know?
[13227.84s -> 13237.48s]  I'm probably just gonna dynamite it, actually.
[13237.48s -> 13238.76s]  We're normal and we should be fine.
[13239.48s -> 13243.41s]  All right, so...
[13244.61s -> 13248.40s]  Once we get to the other side of this building, we'll do it.
[13249.12s -> 13250.38s]  Okay.
[13266.12s -> 13267.88s]  This is relaxing.
[13269.48s -> 13270.04s]  I'm going for it.
[13270.04s -> 13271.00s]  I'm building the thing up.
[13272.64s -> 13273.44s]  No, we're good.
[13273.44s -> 13274.32s]  We're good.
[13274.32s -> 13274.82s]  Just come here.
[13275.76s -> 13277.36s]  Wait, we're done doing it?
[13277.36s -> 13277.86s]  We're good?
[13277.86s -> 13278.64s]  Yeah, yeah, just come here, come here.
[13278.64s -> 13279.14s]  All right.
[13279.78s -> 13283.94s]  Uh, hand to me gently the voodoo doll.
[13287.70s -> 13289.14s]  And the obsidian potion.
[13289.14s -> 13291.78s]  Okay, gently hand you the voodoo doll.
[13292.42s -> 13295.48s]  There it is.
[13295.48s -> 13296.44s]  Okay, gently.
[13296.44s -> 13297.32s]  Why, is it gonna break?
[13297.96s -> 13298.68s]  Gently.
[13299.88s -> 13305.42s]  Okay, and how do I split the potions in half to give you one?
[13306.06s -> 13306.62s]  I'm just gonna drink it.
[13306.62s -> 13309.26s]  Can you right-click it a second time over your inventory or something?
[13309.26s -> 13310.62s]  Or you hold right-click when you pick it?
[13311.42s -> 13312.36s]  Something like that.
[13313.00s -> 13314.28s]  It's just right-click.
[13314.36s -> 13316.12s]  Okay, um, I have a potion here for you.
[13319.77s -> 13320.65s]  Here it comes.
[13320.65s -> 13323.48s]  Okay.
[13323.48s -> 13324.84s]  Okay, Jerma, did you get it?
[13328.54s -> 13330.38s]  So, um, drinking it.
[13330.38s -> 13332.38s]  Uh, are we, are we, are we doing this now?
[13332.38s -> 13334.86s]  Should I press B and drink everything?
[13334.86s -> 13335.58s]  We're doing this.
[13335.58s -> 13335.98s]  Okay.
[13335.98s -> 13337.02s]  Summon up your, uh...
[13337.74s -> 13338.46s]  Why am I on fire?
[13339.26s -> 13340.06s]  Do things.
[13340.06s -> 13340.78s]  Why am I on fire?
[13341.58s -> 13342.22s]  Why am I burning?
[13343.10s -> 13343.82s]  Why am I burning?
[13344.70s -> 13345.90s]  Let's just get the fuck out of me.
[13345.90s -> 13346.40s]  Okay.
[13347.75s -> 13348.31s]  You ready?
[13349.03s -> 13349.99s]  That was insane.
[13349.99s -> 13351.35s]  Okay, I'm, uh, I'm ready.
[13352.07s -> 13353.99s]  I've got my thing summoned.
[13354.95s -> 13355.51s]  Kill that boy.
[13355.51s -> 13357.51s]  What you have to do is throw the voodoo doll into the...
[13358.07s -> 13358.79s]  Oh.
[13358.79s -> 13359.43s]  Here it goes.
[13361.56s -> 13363.00s]  And then we just attack.
[13363.00s -> 13363.48s]  Thing.
[13363.48s -> 13365.00s]  Then we attack and walk backwards.
[13365.88s -> 13370.58s]  Okay, start walking backwards.
[13371.46s -> 13372.66s]  I'm dropping dynamite, so...
[13378.30s -> 13379.42s]  Keep going.
[13379.42s -> 13386.24s]  Oh, yeah.
[13387.10s -> 13388.78s]  I said it wasn't long enough.
[13388.78s -> 13389.90s]  I didn't think I was gonna actually...
[13389.90s -> 13390.40s]  What? He's dead?
[13392.14s -> 13392.64s]  Yeah.
[13395.14s -> 13396.66s]  The last second, I was like, you know what?
[13396.66s -> 13397.62s]  We went...
[13397.62s -> 13399.62s]  We did so much.
[13399.62s -> 13401.62s]  We needed, like, 35 feet.
[13402.50s -> 13404.02s]  Yeah, we were a little over-prepared.
[13408.58s -> 13409.22s]  Wow.
[13409.22s -> 13409.86s]  That's funny.
[13413.43s -> 13416.15s]  We needed, like, a couple of hallways.
[13416.15s -> 13416.71s]  We made...
[13418.18s -> 13421.78s]  Oh my fucking god, dude.
[13422.50s -> 13423.46s]  Are you serious?
[13423.46s -> 13423.96s]  I'm sorry!
[13424.66s -> 13427.14s]  That was, like, the last 40 minutes of this stream.
[13429.83s -> 13431.83s]  No, I did a lot of other things.
[13431.83s -> 13433.03s]  I built a lot of items.
[13435.94s -> 13437.86s]  We needed from here to here.
[13441.46s -> 13443.30s]  Holy shit, you were not confident at all.
[13443.30s -> 13444.02s]  That's so funny.
[13447.19s -> 13448.63s]  That's what you call overkill.
[13448.63s -> 13450.31s]  Yeah. Hey, well, look.
[13450.31s -> 13450.79s]  It's over.
[13450.79s -> 13451.59s]  We win.
[13451.59s -> 13452.95s]  You should have got a couple items
[13452.95s -> 13454.55s]  and everything that he drops is good.
[13455.27s -> 13456.39s]  Okay, wall of flesh.
[13461.61s -> 13462.97s]  Prepare to face the terrors that lurk
[13462.97s -> 13464.49s]  in the light and dark parts of this world.
[13464.49s -> 13467.37s]  Place in your inventory to gain increased item grab range.
[13468.09s -> 13469.21s]  Yeah, I trashed mine.
[13469.93s -> 13474.28s]  Unfortunately for them, they were twisted
[13474.28s -> 13476.04s]  by their inner demons until they were beyond saving.
[13476.04s -> 13476.84s]  The underworld.
[13479.58s -> 13481.58s]  Wild cleric emblem.
[13482.46s -> 13488.20s]  12% increased radiant damage.
[13488.76s -> 13490.68s]  Healing spells will heal an additional one life.
[13491.40s -> 13493.99s]  That's a Beerus healer, okay.
[13493.99s -> 13494.71s]  Shadow diamond.
[13497.21s -> 13499.45s]  Arcane summoner emblem.
[13502.26s -> 13504.22s]  Now that's some good shit.
[13507.99s -> 13510.47s]  15% increased summon damage in plus 20 mana.
[13510.47s -> 13511.27s]  What do I replace?
[13514.39s -> 13515.51s]  I cloud.
[13515.51s -> 13517.19s]  I don't even need cloud in a bottle anymore, do I?
[13517.19s -> 13517.83s]  Because I can fly.
[13518.55s -> 13521.10s]  It's tech right.
[13521.90s -> 13523.26s]  I don't need cloud anymore.
[13523.26s -> 13524.62s]  You probably don't need it now.
[13524.62s -> 13525.66s]  No, I'm just going to put that on.
[13525.66s -> 13526.86s]  I'm going to update it.
[13526.86s -> 13527.66s]  Oh, fuck, fuck.
[13527.66s -> 13529.34s]  This is the tax collector.
[13530.22s -> 13531.10s]  That's awesome.
[13531.74s -> 13534.58s]  Well, I don't have purification powder.
[13535.93s -> 13536.89s]  Replace the bees.
[13536.89s -> 13538.65s]  Oh, I like the defense on the bees still.
[13539.45s -> 13540.89s]  It still looks seems pretty good.
[13544.41s -> 13549.45s]  You can start showing the goblin your accessories
[13549.45s -> 13553.05s]  so you can try and roll like plus four defense on every accessory you have.
[13553.05s -> 13554.09s]  Oh, that's cool.
[13554.09s -> 13556.41s]  So if there's one that like, oh, this one doesn't have the defense,
[13556.41s -> 13559.13s]  you can just try and roll it depending on what it costs.
[13559.13s -> 13560.01s]  Cool.
[13560.01s -> 13563.13s]  Is there a certain stat that a caster or summoner should be looking for?
[13563.13s -> 13565.45s]  Like plus one to more monsters or something?
[13566.17s -> 13567.69s]  Defense is like the best one.
[13567.69s -> 13568.33s]  Just defense.
[13568.33s -> 13569.53s]  Look for defense every time.
[13571.21s -> 13575.00s]  All right, so the goblin is back at the town, right?
[13575.88s -> 13576.38s]  Yep.
[13577.16s -> 13577.88s]  Well, that's cool.
[13578.84s -> 13582.20s]  Um, so now there's a lot of things going on.
[13582.20s -> 13583.80s]  I'm staying down here for like one second
[13583.80s -> 13586.20s]  to get a couple of essences for a super OP weapon.
[13590.36s -> 13593.24s]  And this game is really fun.
[13595.66s -> 13597.74s]  I'm like, I like, don't know what I'm doing still,
[13597.74s -> 13599.26s]  like kind of learning a little.
[13599.26s -> 13601.18s]  But like, this is, this is like really cool.
[13602.38s -> 13604.15s]  There's like so many things.
[13605.03s -> 13606.70s]  There are a lot of things.
[13607.58s -> 13613.10s]  All right, let me, uh, let's talk about the goblin you said, right?
[13613.82s -> 13617.32s]  So you're talking about reforge?
[13619.54s -> 13620.04s]  Yeah.
[13620.58s -> 13623.02s]  Is this going to do it automatically or do I get to look at it?
[13623.99s -> 13625.75s]  Uh, it's a random roll.
[13625.75s -> 13626.25s]  Oh.
[13626.79s -> 13629.90s]  And it's, it's going to roll like the thing that's green, right?
[13630.62s -> 13631.12s]  Yeah.
[13631.42s -> 13632.38s]  Does it, what does it cost?
[13633.58s -> 13634.94s]  It'll tell you when you put the item in.
[13634.94s -> 13635.66s]  Depends on item.
[13636.46s -> 13638.36s]  Three gold, that's it?
[13639.16s -> 13640.94s]  Yeah, the melee speed.
[13640.94s -> 13642.38s]  I'm not, that, that, that sucks on here.
[13648.25s -> 13649.69s]  So I'm looking for anything else really.
[13650.25s -> 13659.26s]  Did it work?
[13659.26s -> 13660.06s]  Am I missing something?
[13667.27s -> 13668.31s]  I don't have enough gold.
[13670.90s -> 13671.62s]  Right.
[13671.62s -> 13672.12s]  Okay.
[13674.34s -> 13683.45s]  Come here, come here, come here.
[13691.48s -> 13691.88s]  Hmm.
[13691.88s -> 13693.08s]  3% movement speed.
[13696.09s -> 13697.69s]  A schmelve.
[13699.34s -> 13700.62s]  Why is this stacking burn?
[13701.66s -> 13702.16s]  Okay.
[13702.62s -> 13704.00s]  That's not bad.
[13706.62s -> 13707.90s]  This one already has four defense.
[13708.54s -> 13711.42s]  I feel like the 4% movement speed on this is, does, is dumb.
[13712.66s -> 13713.16s]  Yeah.
[13713.38s -> 13714.42s]  It's, it's not enough.
[13715.06s -> 13720.63s]  I mean, it's nice because movement speed is like not dying in Toraria, but
[13721.59s -> 13723.99s]  eh, you're really going to have to stack it.
[13728.33s -> 13728.57s]  All right.
[13728.57s -> 13731.93s]  I'm going to, that, that fleeting cloud in the bottle is just trash.
[13731.93s -> 13732.73s]  Now I can just sell it, right?
[13734.12s -> 13735.64s]  Um, don't sell it.
[13735.64s -> 13736.28s]  Don't sell it.
[13736.28s -> 13736.78s]  Okay.
[13737.40s -> 13740.52s]  We need it to keep like, that's why I'm so afraid to sell anything.
[13740.52s -> 13742.20s]  Cause I feel like it might be needed later.
[13742.20s -> 13743.56s]  I explained this a long time ago.
[13744.52s -> 13746.84s]  And that's why I'm saying it.
[13746.84s -> 13747.34s]  Listen.
[13748.36s -> 13753.96s]  When you look at an item, if on the item it says material, then you might need it.
[13753.96s -> 13754.28s]  Right.
[13754.28s -> 13758.17s]  If it doesn't say material and you don't need it, you'll never need it.
[13759.96s -> 13762.36s]  Everything says material on it.
[13762.36s -> 13765.74s]  There's like one thing that doesn't.
[13765.74s -> 13766.30s]  Angry, okay.
[13766.30s -> 13767.18s]  Angry ball and chain.
[13767.18s -> 13767.90s]  Can I just sell that?
[13770.20s -> 13772.92s]  Uh, doesn't say material.
[13772.92s -> 13773.48s]  Hold on a minute.
[13774.28s -> 13776.36s]  No, this thing increases defense by eight.
[13779.85s -> 13780.89s]  It slows you, I think.
[13781.69s -> 13785.32s]  That's pretty good.
[13786.04s -> 13786.68s]  I can fly.
[13787.74s -> 13796.10s]  Oh, yeah.
[13796.10s -> 13797.78s]  I think we needed this whole walkway.
[13798.66s -> 13799.16s]  Huh?
[13800.74s -> 13800.98s]  Yeah.
[13800.98s -> 13802.58s]  This walkway could be longer is all I'm saying.
[13808.31s -> 13810.71s]  I need to get like two more essences of chaos.
[13813.38s -> 13815.70s]  I'm going to make like, I'm going to be making a mistake here.
[13815.70s -> 13817.54s]  Someone's going to scream at me because they're going to see
[13817.54s -> 13819.70s]  that I'm like selling something I'm not supposed to be.
[13833.03s -> 13834.23s]  Honestly, I'm not afraid.
[13834.23s -> 13835.75s]  Mandible bow.
[13835.75s -> 13837.11s]  Not after that last bite.
[13837.11s -> 13838.95s]  It's not, none of these are materials though.
[13838.95s -> 13839.43s]  Like harpoon.
[13839.43s -> 13841.03s]  Oh, the guide is still dead.
[13843.53s -> 13844.33s]  Mandible bow.
[13844.33s -> 13845.45s]  Like this stuff sucks.
[13845.45s -> 13846.09s]  Does it just sell?
[13846.09s -> 13846.59s]  Yeah.
[13847.13s -> 13847.63s]  Just sell it.
[13851.80s -> 13853.00s]  What about this ancient shiv?
[13853.56s -> 13854.28s]  Not material.
[13858.52s -> 13859.64s]  Mandible claws.
[13859.64s -> 13861.16s]  Like these things are dumb, right?
[13861.88s -> 13862.60s]  Yeah.
[13862.60s -> 13863.48s]  Yeah, you're getting it.
[13863.48s -> 13863.80s]  You're getting it.
[13863.80s -> 13864.68s]  I'm not understanding.
[13864.68s -> 13865.56s]  Severed hands.
[13865.56s -> 13866.20s]  Get rid of them.
[13867.16s -> 13868.52s]  Auto trash those severed hands.
[13868.52s -> 13869.08s]  I told you.
[13869.08s -> 13870.20s]  It's going to be slicer.
[13870.20s -> 13870.76s]  Get rid of them.
[13871.64s -> 13873.54s]  Who needs them?
[13873.54s -> 13874.04s]  Nobody.
[13875.58s -> 13875.82s]  All right.
[13875.82s -> 13876.78s]  Let's see how that gets me.
[13876.78s -> 13878.14s]  Demonic carnage.
[13878.14s -> 13879.10s]  What is this doing in here?
[13881.50s -> 13883.10s]  63 melee damage.
[13884.84s -> 13885.96s]  Fast speed 15.
[13885.96s -> 13887.16s]  What the fuck is this in here?
[13887.88s -> 13889.32s]  Oh, I was using that.
[13889.32s -> 13890.60s]  I'm not using it anymore.
[13890.60s -> 13891.10s]  What?
[13896.54s -> 13898.94s]  It's pretty okay, but you need to build really high defense
[13900.11s -> 13901.55s]  and like melee stats.
[13902.52s -> 13905.48s]  Otherwise, you're going to take so much damage trying to use that weapon.
[13905.48s -> 13907.24s]  The harpoon, do anything cool, it's a material.
[13908.56s -> 13910.89s]  I don't think so.
[13912.14s -> 13914.62s]  You can check with the guide, but I don't think it does.
[13915.34s -> 13922.25s]  It's not like it sells for 26 silver.
[13929.47s -> 13930.27s]  Wait, what's going on?
[13930.91s -> 13933.21s]  Why is everybody losing their mind?
[13933.93s -> 13946.01s]  Oh, this is one of those stupid melee damage weapons that aren't melee.
[13950.00s -> 13952.24s]  Now let me try to reroll this again.
[13955.21s -> 13957.21s]  Why does the price come down every time I do it?
[13957.93s -> 13963.92s]  It was three gold last time, now it's 275.
[13969.88s -> 13970.60s]  That's not good.
[13972.49s -> 13973.85s]  Two percent, I went down.
[13977.87s -> 13980.03s]  Two percent melee speed instead of four.
[13997.50s -> 13998.62s]  I only have three gold.
[13998.62s -> 14001.26s]  Yeah, there's a, wait, I have more than that.
[14002.06s -> 14003.58s]  I got way more gold than that.
[14004.22s -> 14008.67s]  This weapon's really good.
[14011.63s -> 14020.67s]  Okay, get up here, turtle.
[14021.31s -> 14031.87s]  Oh yeah, we need to go get you the crazy summon.
[14034.56s -> 14035.84s]  Pig's not going to get hit by the lava?
[14043.58s -> 14044.94s]  Don't kill the pig.
[14044.94s -> 14046.94s]  All right, I just looked over at Chad and I almost died.
[14046.94s -> 14048.46s]  This pig was easy.
[14048.46s -> 14050.94s]  That's because the air is blowing fast.
[14052.06s -> 14053.82s]  The air is fast, dude.
[14053.82s -> 14055.90s]  The wind is going nuts right now.
[14060.64s -> 14061.12s]  One more.
[14061.84s -> 14066.01s]  I feel like I'm in need of a new staff.
[14070.86s -> 14074.46s]  There is an insanely good one that we can get you pretty soon.
[14075.26s -> 14084.78s]  I do, I like this one, but I need to do more damage.
[14085.42s -> 14089.58s]  So one of the first things you do within hard mode is you have to fight
[14089.58s -> 14093.34s]  basically the same bosses you fought before but harder that are mechanical bosses.
[14093.34s -> 14096.06s]  So like the worm we fought is like the mechanical worm.
[14097.02s -> 14100.70s]  And I think it's them that drop hollowed bars and the hollowed staff is actually
[14100.70s -> 14102.14s]  really, really, really, really, really good.
[14102.94s -> 14103.26s]  Really?
[14105.63s -> 14106.43s]  Really.
[14106.43s -> 14113.15s]  The wind is too strong.
[14114.03s -> 14116.56s]  I can't get back in that house.
[14119.72s -> 14120.28s]  Use your hook.
[14121.00s -> 14123.88s]  Oh, right.
[14123.88s -> 14126.92s]  Also, if you hook a closed door and open it, you go whoosh.
[14129.36s -> 14130.08s]  Oh, come on.
[14130.88s -> 14132.64s]  All right, all right.
[14133.28s -> 14134.08s]  Got it.
[14134.08s -> 14138.08s]  Plus three defense and plus 0.75% damage reduction.
[14138.88s -> 14140.75s]  Nice.
[14140.75s -> 14146.73s]  Oh yeah, that's also the only thing you can get is damage reduction.
[14147.45s -> 14153.23s]  So the extra movement speed on the quick lightning boots.
[14154.11s -> 14155.26s]  Why even have that?
[14155.26s -> 14156.62s]  Why not just roll something else?
[14156.62s -> 14157.18s]  They're already quick.
[14157.18s -> 14158.54s]  They're at 14 gold, never mind.
[14162.28s -> 14163.16s]  There's a good reason.
[14163.16s -> 14164.04s]  That's a pretty good reason.
[14172.97s -> 14175.93s]  All right, I'm going to put this other stuff in here.
[14175.93s -> 14179.21s]  I've got like wild cleric emblem, the underworld.
[14180.91s -> 14182.59s]  I'll keep the wall of flesh in the inventory, right?
[14185.02s -> 14185.50s]  If you want.
[14186.54s -> 14188.38s]  If you care about that kind of bonus.
[14188.94s -> 14190.70s]  I mean, it's kind of a good thing.
[14196.14s -> 14196.94s]  Shadow diamonds.
[14197.74s -> 14200.30s]  I'm just telling you what I picked up because I want to be able.
[14200.30s -> 14203.10s]  Oh, well, she told me about the shadow diamonds.
[14205.40s -> 14207.20s]  No, no.
[14207.20s -> 14209.21s]  No, never mind.
[14210.46s -> 14210.86s]  Buy a piggy bank.
[14210.86s -> 14212.22s]  You can put those in the storage, though.
[14214.54s -> 14215.42s]  Buy a piggy bank.
[14217.72s -> 14219.56s]  Does it do you get like a return on investment?
[14219.56s -> 14220.76s]  Do you get like a percentage increase?
[14221.85s -> 14224.89s]  Piggy bank is kind of annoying to use, but it's really good.
[14224.89s -> 14230.28s]  You put items inside of it and you can place it on the ground.
[14230.28s -> 14232.12s]  So it's like a second storage.
[14232.12s -> 14235.95s]  Oh, oh, that's all right.
[14235.95s -> 14238.19s]  So like if at any point you're like, oh, shit, my inventory is full.
[14238.19s -> 14240.99s]  You place that you can put shit in the piggy bank.
[14240.99s -> 14244.03s]  And yeah, I don't like dealing with it myself.
[14244.03s -> 14245.64s]  But it's worth it.
[14245.64s -> 14246.76s]  Well, maybe eventually.
[14253.05s -> 14256.81s]  OK, I am ready.
[14261.29s -> 14264.89s]  I'm just trying to farm minions so I can get a thing.
[14265.69s -> 14268.89s]  If you go to the snow biome and you just start killing shit,
[14268.89s -> 14271.45s]  there's this one like flying around enemy
[14273.84s -> 14275.52s]  that you're going to need to kill a couple of.
[14276.32s -> 14280.40s]  And that's what drops the summon and is the super good summon.
[14280.40s -> 14283.44s]  So you're telling me snow biome, I don't have to go up.
[14285.69s -> 14288.01s]  Press M and I look for snow.
[14288.01s -> 14293.34s]  Yeah, the snow up in the cloud or is that a cloud?
[14297.20s -> 14297.92s]  That's a cloud.
[14297.92s -> 14298.64s]  That's a cloud.
[14298.64s -> 14300.56s]  OK, I do see the snow.
[14302.25s -> 14304.57s]  The snow is at the top of the corruption to the right.
[14304.57s -> 14305.45s]  Yeah, I see.
[14305.45s -> 14308.33s]  So it's going to be a little annoying because it combines two enemies types.
[14310.40s -> 14315.52s]  But yeah, also, now that it's in hard mode, there's like the regular enemies will hurt you.
[14315.52s -> 14316.24s]  So be careful.
[14316.88s -> 14320.08s]  All right, I will go kill the things down there.
[14320.08s -> 14326.73s]  Also, collect snow blocks because then you can make the upgrade to your boots
[14326.73s -> 14328.81s]  and leather if you find any.
[14328.81s -> 14329.49s]  Aye, aye.
[14330.67s -> 14332.03s]  Aye, aye, aye.
[14332.67s -> 14337.68s]  I just tried to double tap D to run fast.
[14339.28s -> 14339.92s]  DD.
[14339.92s -> 14340.48s]  Like, didn't.
[14350.01s -> 14350.81s]  But why though?
[14356.67s -> 14357.63s]  But why though?
[14357.63s -> 14359.55s]  Oh, stop getting so close.
[14361.74s -> 14362.14s]  Hello?
[14363.10s -> 14363.58s]  Hello?
[14364.70s -> 14365.10s]  Hello?
[14366.14s -> 14368.27s]  Hello?
[14369.15s -> 14369.63s]  Hello?
[14370.91s -> 14372.27s]  Hey, hello, right?
[14372.27s -> 14372.83s]  Oh, yeah.
[14372.83s -> 14373.31s]  Yeah, right.
[14373.31s -> 14374.03s]  You think you're funny.
[14374.03s -> 14374.51s]  Hello?
[14376.51s -> 14377.15s]  Hello?
[14377.15s -> 14379.12s]  Let me drop in.
[14379.12s -> 14380.52s]  That guy took a lot of hits.
[14381.24s -> 14390.88s]  You're still not at 400 health, are you?
[14390.88s -> 14391.04s]  No.
[14391.60s -> 14394.41s]  That's what I like about you.
[14395.05s -> 14398.09s]  Hey, thanks.
[14398.89s -> 14400.96s]  You're like not afraid.
[14402.25s -> 14403.61s]  I've made it to the snow.
[14404.25s -> 14408.27s]  Is this snow?
[14408.27s -> 14409.55s]  This is like ice, right?
[14409.55s -> 14410.11s]  This is ice.
[14413.32s -> 14416.56s]  Carnivore tail.
[14416.56s -> 14417.84s]  Oh, what's that?
[14417.84s -> 14418.80s]  Can't look at it.
[14418.80s -> 14419.92s]  I just that hurts a lot.
[14440.44s -> 14443.40s]  You weren't kidding when you said that this there, but much, much harder.
[14443.40s -> 14443.56s]  No.
[14444.52s -> 14448.92s]  Also, if you see something spawn in the eye and the air after you kill something,
[14448.92s -> 14452.30s]  that's like a crown and it like doesn't move.
[14452.30s -> 14454.78s]  Like it's stuck in the air and doesn't drop to the floor.
[14455.50s -> 14456.22s]  Pick those up.
[14456.22s -> 14459.34s]  Essences like essence of sunlight, essence of ice.
[14459.34s -> 14460.46s]  Maybe I don't remember what it's called.
[14460.46s -> 14461.02s]  Do I have it?
[14461.02s -> 14462.78s]  I don't even like that.
[14462.78s -> 14463.42s]  Well, that's not good.
[14464.62s -> 14466.57s]  Bad.
[14466.57s -> 14467.37s]  I don't have any fucking.
[14468.65s -> 14474.51s]  Hey, I found some torches.
[14482.73s -> 14483.21s]  Good thing.
[14483.21s -> 14486.09s]  Like idiot me was able to like save this run.
[14492.48s -> 14495.92s]  See me in the past knew about me in the future.
[14511.84s -> 14514.00s]  In fact, let's just go ahead and like take them all.
[14518.88s -> 14520.64s]  I am about to roll.
[14520.64s -> 14522.40s]  There's a lot of fucking people over there.
[14523.36s -> 14528.81s]  These things are not doing very much damage at all.
[14529.37s -> 14534.96s]  What things?
[14536.75s -> 14537.63s]  My summons.
[14538.83s -> 14542.96s]  Yeah, they're a little outdated at this point.
[14542.96s -> 14545.04s]  So you're saying snow area.
[14545.04s -> 14546.16s]  Snow ice block, right?
[14547.12s -> 14547.92s]  Not snow block.
[14550.60s -> 14552.52s]  I think it's snow block.
[14552.52s -> 14553.24s]  Is it snow?
[14553.24s -> 14555.00s]  Because I can get snow right now.
[14555.00s -> 14555.88s]  Yeah, it's no block.
[14556.84s -> 14567.47s]  How many do we need?
[14570.46s -> 14578.32s]  I mean, describe once you need 20 to make the ice skates,
[14578.32s -> 14580.40s]  which is really what you're in it for, you know?
[14580.40s -> 14582.16s]  Yeah, that's true.
[14582.80s -> 14591.39s]  I feel really bad.
[14591.39s -> 14593.87s]  I spent this much time like crafting this fucking bow.
[14594.67s -> 14595.23s]  It sucks.
[14596.04s -> 14600.20s]  I immediately got this throwing weapon that I think is better.
[14601.79s -> 14602.51s]  It's hard to tell.
[14611.08s -> 14613.00s]  And then what was the enemy that I was looking for down here?
[14614.72s -> 14615.76s]  I don't know how to describe it.
[14616.32s -> 14617.36s]  Usually it's above ground.
[14617.36s -> 14619.28s]  I'm not entirely sure if it shows up above the ground.
[14620.73s -> 14631.28s]  But you know, in the corruption, the flying eyes with the tusks?
[14632.00s -> 14637.68s]  Yeah, it's like that, but it's semi-transparent and icy.
[14637.68s -> 14638.16s]  Okay.
[14638.16s -> 14639.20s]  See, I just saw it.
[14639.84s -> 14640.48s]  I just died.
[14640.48s -> 14642.96s]  Okay, you're going to need to kill it.
[14642.96s -> 14645.12s]  Like it's not 100% drop chance.
[14645.12s -> 14649.12s]  And the item I'm looking for is the thing to summon them.
[14659.69s -> 14660.33s]  Rotten chunk?
[14662.70s -> 14663.18s]  Don't care.
[14663.74s -> 14667.48s]  Jerm is not going to read my message.
[14667.48s -> 14668.60s]  Laughing my ass off.
[14668.60s -> 14669.00s]  Got you.
[14670.52s -> 14671.08s]  Got him.
[14671.08s -> 14671.56s]  Got him.
[14672.52s -> 14673.72s]  He's gonna get you.
[14674.36s -> 14675.88s]  To see you in the funny papers.
[14676.92s -> 14677.96s]  That's your go-to, isn't it?
[14679.40s -> 14679.72s]  Is it?
[14681.82s -> 14683.90s]  I think I have like 300 snow blocks.
[14684.62s -> 14686.96s]  Okay.
[14686.96s -> 14687.76s]  Yeah, you're good.
[14689.04s -> 14690.64s]  I kind of just kept going.
[14690.64s -> 14693.15s]  All right, let's do this.
[14694.19s -> 14695.34s]  Oh, nice.
[14695.34s -> 14696.14s]  These are good.
[14696.14s -> 14708.89s]  All right, looking for the rotten chunk carnivore tail.
[14710.84s -> 14711.48s]  Not down here.
[14712.44s -> 14716.49s]  He said they usually hang out above ground.
[14718.78s -> 14719.58s]  Oh, I'm pretty sure.
[14720.14s -> 14723.69s]  Come on, right here.
[14724.49s -> 14726.99s]  And it didn't look like you dropped it.
[14726.99s -> 14729.96s]  And I'm just a rotten chunk.
[14729.96s -> 14734.91s]  I have no idea what the chance is, but I've never like intentionally farmed them.
[14734.91s -> 14737.31s]  But every time I've gotten that, I've been a very happy boy.
[14738.43s -> 14738.67s]  Got him.
[14738.67s -> 14739.55s]  I'm gonna fucking die.
[14742.48s -> 14744.38s]  What happened?
[14744.38s -> 14745.42s]  It's your fault, dude.
[14746.14s -> 14746.70s]  Hello?
[14746.70s -> 14747.18s]  Dude.
[14748.88s -> 14750.24s]  It's all your fault, dude.
[14751.64s -> 14752.84s]  Come on, dude.
[14752.84s -> 14754.60s]  I can put some of this shit away, finally.
[14758.88s -> 14759.36s]  Dude.
[14759.92s -> 14761.68s]  Is it one of those things where I'll know when I see it?
[14761.68s -> 14762.64s]  Is it shiny or something?
[14765.64s -> 14766.44s]  I don't remember.
[14767.32s -> 14768.76s]  Like, it might be a staff.
[14768.76s -> 14771.08s]  I mean, you'll check it if you see a random thing drop.
[14771.96s -> 14779.66s]  I didn't say hello to the soundboard.
[14780.38s -> 14782.51s]  I will if it happens again.
[14782.51s -> 14782.91s]  Hello?
[14782.91s -> 14783.31s]  Hello?
[14784.54s -> 14785.26s]  Hello?
[14785.26s -> 14785.90s]  Hey.
[14785.90s -> 14786.54s]  Hello?
[14786.54s -> 14786.94s]  Hello?
[14787.74s -> 14788.14s]  Hello?
[14788.86s -> 14789.50s]  That wasn't even me.
[14790.14s -> 14791.10s]  That's a whole new person.
[14791.10s -> 14791.98s]  You're not going to say hello?
[14792.70s -> 14793.10s]  Hello?
[14793.58s -> 14795.24s]  Hello?
[14799.45s -> 14799.85s]  Goodbye.
[14801.29s -> 14803.77s]  Now, how many hellos do you have?
[14805.42s -> 14806.14s]  Eight or nine.
[14806.14s -> 14806.38s]  No.
[14807.02s -> 14807.90s]  And one no.
[14807.90s -> 14808.94s]  I think I got it.
[14808.94s -> 14810.62s]  Is it a glacial crystal?
[14811.42s -> 14813.10s]  I don't know.
[14814.59s -> 14815.39s]  It's a quest item.
[14815.39s -> 14815.79s]  Wait, no.
[14816.51s -> 14818.06s]  I got it.
[14818.94s -> 14819.90s]  I got the quest item.
[14823.87s -> 14825.07s]  I see shard.
[14825.07s -> 14827.15s]  My armor gives three defense.
[14827.15s -> 14827.87s]  I see shard.
[14828.51s -> 14830.04s]  It's a staff.
[14840.14s -> 14841.50s]  God damn it, dude.
[14841.50s -> 14842.70s]  I hope I'm killing the right things.
[14842.70s -> 14843.42s]  I believe I am.
[14847.72s -> 14848.52s]  I see shard.
[14849.16s -> 14850.04s]  I see shard.
[14850.76s -> 14851.32s]  No.
[14851.32s -> 14851.88s]  What does it all do?
[14851.88s -> 14852.84s]  What's this?
[14852.84s -> 14853.72s]  Glacial crystal.
[14855.00s -> 14856.36s]  You can't pick up more than one of these.
[14867.69s -> 14870.25s]  The monster spawns in the underground ice biome.
[14871.85s -> 14873.93s]  This is not it here, what I'm attacking up.
[14875.31s -> 14878.91s]  Oh, I know they spawn there, but underground ice biome might be better.
[14880.19s -> 14883.95s]  Which is probably underneath where you are.
[14883.95s -> 14884.99s]  So just go underneath.
[14889.26s -> 14889.74s]  Yeah, it is.
[14890.62s -> 14891.74s]  There should be some down there.
[14893.96s -> 14894.20s]  All right.
[14894.20s -> 14895.24s]  Well, hold on a minute here.
[14895.24s -> 14895.72s]  Be careful.
[14907.60s -> 14908.40s]  Because I'm scared of this.
[14908.40s -> 14909.04s]  Where's my rope?
[14909.68s -> 14912.09s]  I don't know.
[14917.69s -> 14918.57s]  I need the guide.
[14918.57s -> 14921.45s]  I hate when the guide dies and then you get a whole new item.
[14922.54s -> 14923.02s]  What does this do?
[14923.02s -> 14924.86s]  And the guide's still dead because you went to hard mode
[14924.86s -> 14926.22s]  and you're like, come on, guide.
[14927.10s -> 14929.87s]  You know what I'm saying?
[14931.31s -> 14931.55s]  Yeah.
[14932.35s -> 14932.67s]  What?
[14932.67s -> 14933.31s]  Yeah, whatever.
[14935.07s -> 14936.33s]  Found him.
[14936.33s -> 14937.93s]  No, that's not an ice corrupter.
[14937.93s -> 14945.16s]  Hey, remember these ebb and stone blocks?
[14946.76s -> 14947.40s]  I have them now.
[14948.81s -> 14949.37s]  That's cool.
[14950.25s -> 14952.92s]  Remember like two hours ago when you were looking for these?
[14954.36s -> 14954.84s]  Got them now.
[14954.84s -> 14956.60s]  And I had to go get something real quick.
[14957.16s -> 14959.16s]  It's called an ice clasper.
[14959.16s -> 14959.40s]  Okay.
[14961.34s -> 14961.90s]  It is.
[14961.90s -> 14962.54s]  He's correct.
[14963.18s -> 14967.15s]  This is an actual statement just made.
[14967.79s -> 14973.13s]  My fingers feel like wet cat food.
[14975.76s -> 14978.48s]  What does it mean when you feel like wet cat food?
[14982.22s -> 14982.86s]  Are you all right?
[14986.14s -> 14986.86s]  No.
[14986.86s -> 14988.46s]  No, I'm not all right.
[14988.46s -> 14995.69s]  Okay.
[14996.25s -> 14997.21s]  Icy shard.
[14998.09s -> 15001.58s]  We're just going down.
[15002.14s -> 15005.74s]  I wish I brought bombs.
[15006.70s -> 15013.80s]  Can I get a better pickaxe?
[15013.80s -> 15015.80s]  I feel like it's been ages since I've got a new one.
[15016.36s -> 15019.13s]  How do I stop biting my fingernails?
[15019.13s -> 15019.85s]  Which one are you using?
[15020.49s -> 15021.53s]  Dip your fingers in vinegar.
[15022.89s -> 15023.45s]  Come on.
[15023.45s -> 15024.89s]  None of this water fucking count.
[15025.85s -> 15034.51s]  Uh, uh.
[15034.51s -> 15050.65s]  The purple ice block.
[15050.65s -> 15050.89s]  Cool.
[15056.09s -> 15057.21s]  Purple ice school.
[15058.09s -> 15059.69s]  I feel like I know what this tastes like.
[15059.69s -> 15061.29s]  I want to like crunch into this purple ice.
[15062.25s -> 15065.71s]  It's going to have that like a good fruit juicy grape kind of taste.
[15070.75s -> 15071.71s]  Okay, bro.
[15072.43s -> 15082.32s]  Come on, bro.
[15082.32s -> 15083.36s]  Ice block.
[15083.36s -> 15089.12s]  Maybe I should get some of this too.
[15098.49s -> 15098.81s]  All right.
[15098.81s -> 15099.93s]  Well, there's frost worm.
[15099.93s -> 15111.26s]  I didn't drop anything.
[15117.04s -> 15117.92s]  Did I upgrade my boots?
[15117.92s -> 15118.48s]  Yes, I did.
[15127.56s -> 15128.28s]  Yes, I did.
[15128.28s -> 15139.72s]  I'm trying to figure out like the best.
[15139.72s -> 15142.28s]  Should I just keep going down into the ice?
[15142.28s -> 15143.00s]  Just keep going?
[15146.12s -> 15148.76s]  I mean, this is clearly like we're getting down to like ice now.
[15152.19s -> 15152.99s]  Oh, I'm muted.
[15152.99s -> 15158.20s]  There's a lot of mobs that you kill in hard mode that drop really good things.
[15158.20s -> 15159.88s]  So you're like not wasting time.
[15159.88s -> 15160.12s]  Yeah.
[15161.55s -> 15164.11s]  I mean, I've picked up at least a handful of really cool looking things.
[15165.31s -> 15166.75s]  Have you gotten any essences?
[15168.59s -> 15170.75s]  I have gotten like a, I've gotten a dragon essence.
[15171.39s -> 15171.95s]  No, I'm sorry.
[15171.95s -> 15172.75s]  Dragon scale.
[15173.56s -> 15173.96s]  Okay.
[15173.96s -> 15175.00s]  Yeah, that's useful for something.
[15175.00s -> 15180.96s]  But if you find like sunlight essence, I think elum essence might be the cold one.
[15181.76s -> 15182.64s]  I need those.
[15182.64s -> 15193.04s]  Okay.
[15193.04s -> 15197.74s]  Oh, also very important for the progression of Terraria.
[15197.74s -> 15199.42s]  If you'd understand what's going on right now.
[15199.42s -> 15199.66s]  Sure.
[15201.56s -> 15205.32s]  When you get into hard mode, the first thing you should do, one of the first things,
[15205.96s -> 15208.06s]  it's actually it's going to be annoying.
[15209.98s -> 15211.34s]  You get the poon hammer.
[15211.34s -> 15215.26s]  It's literally called poon hammer from the wall of flesh.
[15215.26s -> 15219.18s]  It's guaranteed drop and the demon alters that are in the corruption zone.
[15219.18s -> 15222.70s]  You smash them with the poon hammer and then it adds new resources to the world
[15226.94s -> 15227.98s]  because he pooned them.
[15228.62s -> 15229.10s]  Of course.
[15231.64s -> 15232.36s]  Okay.
[15232.36s -> 15236.97s]  I just want to make sure we're on the same page with like the poon hammer.
[15237.93s -> 15238.09s]  Yeah.
[15241.95s -> 15243.39s]  I don't know who that was.
[15244.19s -> 15245.15s]  That could have been anybody.
[15248.59s -> 15248.83s]  Yep.
[15250.17s -> 15250.57s]  Snow.
[15250.57s -> 15251.53s]  Come on, anymore snow.
[15252.33s -> 15254.25s]  Maybe like find a cave or something.
[15255.36s -> 15259.36s]  Also, if you see lead, surprisingly, we still need it.
[15260.32s -> 15262.40s]  Actually, there's usually a planet that has it.
[15262.40s -> 15263.76s]  If you find a gravity potion.
[15264.40s -> 15265.36s]  Actually, I can buy one.
[15266.16s -> 15267.44s]  I'm on operation lead.
[15268.24s -> 15273.42s]  I'm going to take a brief detour from all the important freaking work I'm doing.
[15273.42s -> 15274.62s]  Get some lead.
[15274.62s -> 15275.42s]  What's the sunbat?
[15278.19s -> 15279.55s]  Sin bed sunbat.
[15280.59s -> 15281.79s]  Why is the sunbat down here?
[15288.46s -> 15289.10s]  Good question.
[15290.73s -> 15292.57s]  Is that like, is he got, is he worth something?
[15293.37s -> 15301.80s]  That is really good.
[15303.87s -> 15305.39s]  Oh, angry dog.
[15305.39s -> 15305.63s]  What?
[15306.43s -> 15310.96s]  Fight the angry dog.
[15311.68s -> 15315.15s]  Did he drop anything?
[15315.71s -> 15317.66s]  Cursed flame.
[15317.66s -> 15325.58s]  Well, there's a spot to go down here.
[15326.30s -> 15340.60s]  Still in the ice biome.
[15340.60s -> 15341.48s]  That's good.
[15341.48s -> 15345.47s]  What are they still shooting at?
[15345.47s -> 15346.59s]  All right, you guys can stop now.
[15348.03s -> 15349.84s]  Oh, wait, the sunbat.
[15351.12s -> 15352.16s]  But he could sneak up on me.
[15352.88s -> 15356.44s]  That's not going to be good here.
[15356.44s -> 15356.92s]  What's this?
[15358.44s -> 15360.04s]  Essence of something.
[15360.84s -> 15371.95s]  There's a big cave down here.
[15371.95s -> 15377.53s]  This should be good.
[15377.53s -> 15378.01s]  Pick it up.
[15378.01s -> 15378.73s]  I didn't pick it up.
[15379.29s -> 15384.22s]  I thought I, no, I thought I did pick it up.
[15384.22s -> 15385.02s]  This, there was two then.
[15386.00s -> 15386.96s]  Essence of sunlight.
[15386.96s -> 15392.38s]  And did I, I didn't pick it up that first time when it popped up on the screen.
[15395.07s -> 15395.55s]  Thank God.
[15395.55s -> 15398.59s]  You guys just said that because I, I thought I had, I thought it went in me.
[15398.59s -> 15405.64s]  All right, let's keep going.
[15409.98s -> 15410.54s]  Amethyst.
[15411.26s -> 15413.02s]  I'm running out of torches though.
[15413.02s -> 15413.58s]  Not good.
[15414.62s -> 15433.31s]  No, when it popped up on the screen, I, I saw, I mean, I would,
[15433.31s -> 15434.67s]  I said the name of the thing.
[15434.67s -> 15436.51s]  I said essence of, and then I kept going.
[15436.51s -> 15439.42s]  I thought I just picked it up.
[15439.42s -> 15439.74s]  Okay.
[15439.74s -> 15441.48s]  I want people to make it fun of me.
[15441.48s -> 15442.60s]  That's fine.
[15442.60s -> 15456.80s]  It's down here.
[15456.80s -> 15457.20s]  Anything.
[15458.88s -> 15459.92s]  The generation potion.
[15459.92s -> 15460.16s]  Sick.
[15466.33s -> 15468.04s]  Give me that staff.
[15468.04s -> 15468.52s]  I want it.
[15469.40s -> 15470.12s]  Let me do this.
[15471.34s -> 15472.22s]  Let me have my fun.
[15473.02s -> 15476.75s]  I have, how many ice blocks do I have?
[15477.31s -> 15478.35s]  Absolute shit load.
[15478.35s -> 15478.59s]  All right.
[15478.59s -> 15479.87s]  I'm going to have to like come back.
[15483.39s -> 15485.95s]  Kind of running out of materials and space.
[15489.08s -> 15489.64s]  Go up here.
[15504.09s -> 15504.65s]  Essence.
[15508.04s -> 15508.68s]  Ice slimer.
[15509.64s -> 15511.45s]  Where am I?
[15512.57s -> 15513.21s]  Oh, there it is.
[15513.21s -> 15513.85s]  Ice clasper.
[15514.57s -> 15518.19s]  Did I get it?
[15519.31s -> 15520.43s]  Essence of Ilium.
[15522.59s -> 15523.95s]  Oh yeah, that's it.
[15523.95s -> 15527.60s]  Did I pick it up?
[15537.71s -> 15538.67s]  Essence of Ilium.
[15539.31s -> 15540.11s]  That's what I'm looking for.
[15540.99s -> 15541.49s]  Yep.
[15542.35s -> 15543.31s]  That's one of the things.
[15543.31s -> 15545.31s]  Somebody said it's not what I'm actually looking for though.
[15546.03s -> 15548.27s]  It's, it's, it's a thing that you're looking for.
[15548.27s -> 15548.99s]  Okay.
[15548.99s -> 15550.44s]  It's part of the puzzle.
[15551.00s -> 15551.88s]  It's part of the puzzle.
[15564.00s -> 15568.41s]  And there's another one.
[15569.85s -> 15571.53s]  So those things also drop a staff.
[15571.53s -> 15572.97s]  And that's what I really want, right?
[15572.97s -> 15575.21s]  I'm just going to hang out here then if they just, if they spawn in here.
[15576.81s -> 15579.29s]  Dude, you can like go get a drink and just let your summons kill them.
[15579.29s -> 15579.85s]  They come near you.
[15581.05s -> 15582.73s]  And it's just AFK farm this game.
[15587.95s -> 15590.75s]  We don't, we don't give a shit about the heart crystals anymore, right?
[15593.64s -> 15595.18s]  We do for some reason.
[15595.18s -> 15595.66s]  We do.
[15595.66s -> 15596.38s]  Okay.
[15596.38s -> 15601.79s]  Got Jacob's here.
[15608.60s -> 15619.63s]  I don't want to drown.
[15620.19s -> 15622.68s]  That would be bad.
[15623.96s -> 15629.31s]  That started to be because my name is Jacob.
[15630.59s -> 15639.77s]  That's why I didn't die as an ancient ice chunk.
[15640.33s -> 15641.29s]  Ah, what's that?
[15642.46s -> 15644.46s]  Uh, crafting material for something.
[15645.90s -> 15647.10s]  This ice shouldn't break.
[15652.70s -> 15658.48s]  Um, summons an ice clasper to fight for you.
[15660.56s -> 15662.48s]  Are you kidding me?
[15664.14s -> 15664.62s]  This is it.
[15665.34s -> 15667.80s]  There it is.
[15669.74s -> 15670.30s]  I got it.
[15670.94s -> 15678.75s]  I'm excited now.
[15678.75s -> 15679.15s]  All right.
[15679.15s -> 15680.91s]  So I have like a cool, powerful thing now.
[15682.76s -> 15683.80s]  Oh, you just got it.
[15683.80s -> 15684.36s]  I just got it.
[15685.16s -> 15685.48s]  Wow.
[15685.48s -> 15685.88s]  You did it.
[15686.68s -> 15688.52s]  Well, yeah, now you, uh, now you win.
[15688.52s -> 15688.84s]  I did.
[15688.84s -> 15689.32s]  Now I win.
[15689.32s -> 15690.84s]  You know, I've been getting some upgrades.
[15693.37s -> 15694.09s]  I got a lot of them.
[15694.09s -> 15694.73s]  Branding material.
[15694.73s -> 15696.97s]  Making some power plays, making, making some power moves.
[15696.97s -> 15697.61s]  You know what I'm saying?
[15697.61s -> 15698.17s]  Something else over here.
[15698.17s -> 15698.57s]  What's this?
[15698.57s -> 15699.69s]  Topaz crawler?
[15704.65s -> 15705.21s]  Use it.
[15705.21s -> 15706.09s]  Not yet.
[15706.09s -> 15706.89s]  I don't want to use it yet.
[15707.61s -> 15710.27s]  All right.
[15710.27s -> 15711.63s]  I think that's, uh, I'm good, right?
[15711.63s -> 15713.76s]  I'll just get off.
[15713.76s -> 15714.88s]  Dude, you are so good.
[15715.68s -> 15717.60s]  So are you telling me I can have like seven of those?
[15717.60s -> 15718.08s]  Six of those?
[15718.08s -> 15721.53s]  I have however many you can have.
[15721.53s -> 15722.33s]  Oh, wow.
[15722.33s -> 15724.25s]  I don't, I'm not keeping track of your damage.
[15725.69s -> 15727.29s]  Yeah, they're, they're insane.
[15727.29s -> 15731.53s]  It will stay good for a long time just because how actively they seek out targets.
[15732.49s -> 15735.85s]  10, but from 10 damage to 50.
[15739.26s -> 15742.94s]  That's a huge difference because really all my damage has been coming from the,
[15743.82s -> 15747.42s]  the sphere stuff thing that's been doing all the damage.
[15752.36s -> 15752.84s]  Nice.
[15752.84s -> 15755.24s]  Um, stay there for one second.
[15755.24s -> 15756.20s]  Stay here.
[15756.20s -> 15757.40s]  I'm going to teleport to you.
[15757.96s -> 15759.08s]  Actually, there's something you can help me with.
[15759.08s -> 15761.16s]  I have no torches, so hopefully you bring light.
[15763.87s -> 15765.31s]  Uh, I have 2000 torches.
[15765.31s -> 15765.95s]  Would you like some?
[15767.13s -> 15768.17s]  Yeah, it'd probably be nice.
[15770.54s -> 15771.82s]  There's a chilled turtle down here.
[15775.28s -> 15776.08s]  Uh, here.
[15776.08s -> 15776.88s]  I'm dropping them.
[15777.52s -> 15778.62s]  You ready?
[15779.58s -> 15780.30s]  Um, hold on.
[15780.30s -> 15781.82s]  There's like 500 torches right there.
[15785.28s -> 15786.72s]  I think they fit perfectly in this hole.
[15786.72s -> 15787.68s]  They did.
[15787.68s -> 15790.11s]  I don't think I can even pick them up.
[15790.75s -> 15792.43s]  I'm out of space.
[15792.43s -> 15793.31s]  Glow stick.
[15793.31s -> 15797.40s]  Um, fuck.
[15797.40s -> 15797.96s]  What do I have?
[15797.96s -> 15799.00s]  What dumb thing do I have?
[15800.04s -> 15801.24s]  I have some lead ore.
[15801.80s -> 15802.52s]  Not very many.
[15803.08s -> 15805.84s]  This lens.
[15806.64s -> 15808.40s]  Do I have dirt?
[15808.40s -> 15809.28s]  Oh, I do have dirt.
[15809.28s -> 15810.24s]  You're right.
[15810.24s -> 15811.04s]  Do I have dirt?
[15813.77s -> 15814.41s]  Snow block.
[15814.97s -> 15815.37s]  No.
[15815.37s -> 15815.85s]  All right.
[15815.85s -> 15816.81s]  I got to get out of here.
[15817.37s -> 15822.22s]  I got to get out of here.
[15822.78s -> 15825.02s]  Use the heart.
[15825.02s -> 15825.74s]  I can't.
[15825.74s -> 15827.10s]  You need to come up here to me.
[15827.10s -> 15828.38s]  You need to come up to the surface.
[15828.38s -> 15829.34s]  There's a boss.
[15833.71s -> 15835.07s]  That will probably kick our ass.
[15836.49s -> 15837.45s]  Be gone, evil.
[15840.70s -> 15841.50s]  Uh, you just killed it.
[15843.18s -> 15843.98s]  Uh, no.
[15843.98s -> 15845.18s]  It's still going to be on the surface.
[15845.18s -> 15846.14s]  You need to come up.
[15846.14s -> 15847.69s]  I'm coming up now.
[15847.69s -> 15849.69s]  Uh, I need to put my, uh, anything on.
[15853.12s -> 15854.00s]  There's going to be ghosts.
[15854.88s -> 15857.85s]  Uh, don't die, dude.
[15857.85s -> 15859.77s]  I don't even know what's going on down here.
[15860.57s -> 15861.69s]  I'm trying to get out.
[15865.02s -> 15880.59s]  Fuck.
[15880.59s -> 15882.51s]  Dude, don't, don't get ghosted.
[15882.51s -> 15884.59s]  I'm trying just to get the fuck out of the hole.
[15884.59s -> 15902.92s]  All right.
[15902.92s -> 15903.56s]  I'm on the surface.
[15905.04s -> 15906.72s]  Uh, is there an ice golem?
[15906.72s -> 15907.60s]  Is there a blizzard?
[15907.60s -> 15908.88s]  Like, is it storming up?
[15910.30s -> 15910.86s]  Uh, yes.
[15910.86s -> 15911.98s]  It's very blizzardy out here.
[15912.70s -> 15913.02s]  Okay.
[15913.02s -> 15915.50s]  Walk left and right and try and see if you can find the ice golem.
[15915.50s -> 15916.86s]  Maybe it was underground.
[15916.86s -> 15919.26s]  So, because I went up the one way.
[15919.26s -> 15924.00s]  I'm fucking confused.
[15924.00s -> 15924.24s]  Why?
[15924.24s -> 15925.20s]  Why is this not?
[15925.20s -> 15926.00s]  Is this a summon?
[15927.36s -> 15937.85s]  I got my shit.
[15940.30s -> 15940.70s]  All right.
[15940.70s -> 15941.18s]  He's here.
[15941.18s -> 15941.42s]  He's here.
[15941.42s -> 15942.38s]  Help bar showed up again.
[15942.38s -> 15942.54s]  Okay.
[15942.54s -> 15943.02s]  I'm coming up.
[15944.06s -> 15944.86s]  He's somewhere.
[15945.90s -> 15946.80s]  I don't know where exactly.
[15946.80s -> 15948.08s]  Be careful because he's going to hurt.
[15949.39s -> 15950.67s]  I don't know if we're ready for him.
[15952.75s -> 15953.79s]  Oh, he's on me.
[15953.79s -> 15954.19s]  On me.
[15954.19s -> 15954.99s]  He's down this hole.
[15956.67s -> 15957.79s]  Your things are attacking him.
[15958.51s -> 15958.75s]  Good.
[15959.63s -> 15967.90s]  He's almost dead because the summons are nuts.
[15969.31s -> 15969.79s]  Melt him.
[15969.79s -> 15970.67s]  Melt him.
[15970.67s -> 15971.87s]  And also he's in a hole.
[15973.80s -> 15974.92s]  Wait, does it corrupt her?
[15975.64s -> 15976.04s]  Okay.
[15976.04s -> 15976.60s]  Keep going up.
[15976.60s -> 15977.32s]  Keep climbing out of the hole.
[15977.32s -> 15977.88s]  Climb out of the hole.
[15978.68s -> 15979.32s]  Go to the surface.
[15980.20s -> 15985.34s]  Uh, oh, oh, go, go, go, go.
[15986.86s -> 15994.83s]  Where the hell is this thing?
[15996.00s -> 15998.16s]  Um, it was in the hole.
[16001.29s -> 16001.93s]  Oh, it's on me.
[16001.93s -> 16003.29s]  I mean, this thing jumping around.
[16003.29s -> 16004.81s]  It's going to, they hurt a lot, dude.
[16005.53s -> 16007.95s]  Well, they drop really good items.
[16018.83s -> 16020.19s]  Uh, it should be dead.
[16021.13s -> 16022.65s]  This is like pure fucking.
[16024.97s -> 16025.61s]  Mimics drop.
[16025.61s -> 16026.81s]  Wait, where did they die?
[16027.93s -> 16028.73s]  What the fuck?
[16028.73s -> 16029.53s]  The dart rifle.
[16029.53s -> 16030.81s]  Why is there another one?
[16030.81s -> 16031.37s]  Let's kill.
[16031.37s -> 16032.97s]  They, they just spawn in blizzards.
[16036.49s -> 16038.01s]  He's over here underneath this house.
[16043.32s -> 16043.88s]  Holy shit.
[16043.88s -> 16045.00s]  They are destroying him.
[16046.51s -> 16046.75s]  Yeah.
[16046.75s -> 16048.11s]  Those summons are ridiculous.
[16048.11s -> 16048.43s]  What?
[16054.35s -> 16055.39s]  Oh my God.
[16055.95s -> 16056.67s]  I can't pick up anything.
[16056.67s -> 16057.31s]  I have no room.
[16057.31s -> 16057.95s]  There's another one.
[16057.95s -> 16058.67s]  There's another mimic.
[16062.27s -> 16063.55s]  They just kind of wiggle towards you.
[16063.55s -> 16065.47s]  And then they go up in the air and try and slam on top.
[16066.27s -> 16070.91s]  So if you see it go up, just move a little bit to the left.
[16070.91s -> 16071.55s]  You should be fine.
[16072.19s -> 16073.08s]  I'm stuck.
[16073.08s -> 16074.12s]  I'm stuck next to the house.
[16074.12s -> 16074.44s]  Open the door.
[16074.44s -> 16075.00s]  Dig out the right.
[16075.00s -> 16075.64s]  Dig out the right.
[16079.08s -> 16080.04s]  It's like a horror movie.
[16081.08s -> 16082.41s]  Okay.
[16082.41s -> 16082.81s]  I made it.
[16105.04s -> 16106.48s]  I can't tell what's happening.
[16106.48s -> 16107.52s]  I don't even know where we are.
[16108.16s -> 16109.52s]  He's on you.
[16109.52s -> 16110.00s]  He's on you.
[16110.24s -> 16110.80s]  Oh, it hurts.
[16112.94s -> 16117.74s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[16117.74s -> 16118.78s]  No, no.
[16118.78s -> 16119.10s]  Hide.
[16119.82s -> 16120.14s]  Hide.
[16120.14s -> 16120.70s]  I'm hiding.
[16123.16s -> 16123.96s]  Keep away from me.
[16124.60s -> 16126.84s]  I'm dead.
[16126.84s -> 16130.68s]  No, it's all right.
[16131.74s -> 16132.06s]  Kill it.
[16132.06s -> 16133.18s]  Are you gonna buy a wormhole?
[16137.15s -> 16137.39s]  All right.
[16137.39s -> 16138.59s]  I think I have one already.
[16138.59s -> 16142.60s]  Is there another one spawning?
[16142.60s -> 16143.16s]  I killed him.
[16143.72s -> 16148.83s]  Dude, I got to like just I got a ton of shit.
[16148.83s -> 16150.11s]  I just gotta deposit and come back.
[16153.85s -> 16154.49s]  All right.
[16154.49s -> 16155.69s]  Is it done or is there more?
[16155.69s -> 16157.13s]  It's, it's, it's dead.
[16157.13s -> 16157.37s]  Okay.
[16158.01s -> 16163.02s]  I still need to destroy some altars with the poon hammer.
[16163.02s -> 16164.02s]  Alright, I...
[16164.02s -> 16167.02s]  And would appreciate all of your summons nearby.
[16167.02s -> 16169.02s]  Let me make this staff.
[16169.02s -> 16170.64s]  Right?
[16170.64s -> 16171.64s]  Okay.
[16171.64s -> 16172.64s]  Wait, this what?
[16172.64s -> 16173.64s]  What are you making?
[16173.64s -> 16175.64s]  Can I make something?
[16175.64s -> 16178.93s]  Can you?
[16178.93s -> 16184.32s]  Yeah, I thought I got two different materials for something.
[16184.32s -> 16187.84s]  I don't know what you got.
[16187.84s -> 16192.20s]  Wasn't I looking for the essence?
[16192.20s -> 16197.61s]  That can't make anything yet.
[16197.61s -> 16198.61s]  No, okay.
[16198.61s -> 16200.61s]  Where's the dude?
[16200.61s -> 16202.61s]  They just make a lot of things.
[16202.61s -> 16204.61s]  And you need multiple.
[16204.61s -> 16206.61s]  Where's the...
[16206.61s -> 16208.61s]  The guide might be dead still.
[16208.61s -> 16211.75s]  I think he's dead.
[16211.75s -> 16213.75s]  Oh no, he came back. He's all the way on the left.
[16213.75s -> 16216.12s]  He's the second on the left.
[16216.12s -> 16223.86s]  Oh, I got something for you.
[16223.86s -> 16225.86s]  I don't know what this is.
[16225.86s -> 16228.86s]  Cosmic Immaterializer.
[16228.86s -> 16231.48s]  Oh, this is a different summon.
[16231.48s -> 16234.88s]  Sun Gods, this is like...
[16234.88s -> 16236.88s]  This takes...
[16236.88s -> 16241.36s]  There's nothing I can do with that right now.
[16241.36s -> 16242.36s]  What?
[16242.36s -> 16246.36s]  Summons a Cosmic Energy Spiral to fight for you.
[16246.36s -> 16250.56s]  Does 4,439 damage.
[16250.56s -> 16253.95s]  Wait, what?
[16253.95s -> 16257.95s]  The thing that I can turn this staff into does 40, like 500 damage.
[16257.95s -> 16262.44s]  Oh, yeah, that would take a long time to do that, though.
[16262.44s -> 16264.44s]  What about the essence?
[16264.44s -> 16267.77s]  Let me see what that...
[16267.77s -> 16268.77s]  What can I do with that?
[16268.77s -> 16286.50s]  Did you pick up all the stuff that was there?
[16286.50s -> 16288.50s]  I'm still getting it.
[16288.50s -> 16290.50s]  Oh, dude, this sword is awesome.
[16290.50s -> 16292.19s]  I'm so hyped.
[16292.19s -> 16293.19s]  Starlight Wings?
[16293.19s -> 16295.19s]  Dude, everyone, get hype and chat.
[16295.19s -> 16302.23s]  Reduces damage.
[16302.23s -> 16304.66s]  Wings of the Nightingale.
[16304.66s -> 16306.96s]  Horizontal Speed.
[16306.96s -> 16309.33s]  7.5.
[16309.33s -> 16311.33s]  Acceleration Multiplier.
[16311.33s -> 16313.70s]  Average Vertical Speed.
[16313.70s -> 16315.70s]  These are stats I have not seen before.
[16315.70s -> 16319.16s]  Blood Orange?
[16319.16s -> 16321.16s]  Permanently increases maximum life by 25.
[16326.24s -> 16328.24s]  Prismaline?
[16328.24s -> 16334.92s]  It's like a knife core of Ilium.
[16334.92s -> 16338.19s]  Cryo Key.
[16338.19s -> 16341.20s]  Summons Cryogen.
[16341.20s -> 16343.20s]  Dimensional Soul Artifact.
[16343.20s -> 16348.57s]  Boosts all damage by 25%, but at what cost?
[16348.57s -> 16350.57s]  Ooh, this is what we get. Cool.
[16350.57s -> 16353.45s]  Arc of the Ancients.
[16353.45s -> 16358.63s]  That's the super sword that I can pretty much make.
[16358.63s -> 16360.63s]  Yeah, you kind of can, can't you?
[16360.63s -> 16361.63s]  Yeah.
[16361.63s -> 16363.63s]  It's ridiculous.
[16363.63s -> 16365.63s]  It does melee damage,
[16365.63s -> 16367.63s]  but it makes stars shoot from the sky
[16367.63s -> 16368.63s]  and missiles shoot from your weapon
[16368.63s -> 16370.63s]  and just clutters the screen with nonsense.
[16370.63s -> 16371.63s]  But it's melee.
[16371.63s -> 16374.25s]  What about the Archilis stuff?
[16374.25s -> 16375.25s]  How do you do that?
[16375.25s -> 16376.25s]  I mean, the Archilis sword,
[16376.25s -> 16377.25s]  the thing that you would like,
[16377.25s -> 16381.54s]  oh, hold on to that.
[16381.54s -> 16383.54s]  Isn't that one of the components?
[16383.54s -> 16384.54s]  What are you talking about?
[16384.54s -> 16385.54s]  Is that one of the components for this?
[16385.54s -> 16388.04s]  Yeah, yeah.
[16388.04s -> 16390.04s]  To make Arch of the Ancients.
[16390.04s -> 16392.04s]  Excalibur is really easy to get you.
[16392.04s -> 16394.04s]  And then we have the other sword.
[16394.04s -> 16396.60s]  We would just need the essences, which we have.
[16396.60s -> 16399.60s]  We have three Elum and three Chaos already.
[16402.86s -> 16404.36s]  This one.
[16404.36s -> 16407.36s]  Slow moving ball of flash freezing magma.
[16407.36s -> 16413.82s]  Nano round.
[16413.82s -> 16414.82s]  The butcher.
[16414.82s -> 16418.62s]  All right.
[16418.62s -> 16423.16s]  Well, let me just deposit this shit
[16423.16s -> 16426.58s]  because I'm not going to be,
[16426.58s -> 16428.58s]  you're going to be using that, not me.
[16428.58s -> 16435.77s]  Silver ore.
[16435.77s -> 16437.77s]  Even stone block.
[16437.77s -> 16441.04s]  This is still working really well.
[16441.04s -> 16443.04s]  I don't think I'm going to have this on the bar anymore.
[16443.04s -> 16447.45s]  I don't, yeah, I don't think I'm going to be,
[16447.45s -> 16450.45s]  let me see what that can turn into though.
[16450.45s -> 16455.96s]  What can I turn this into?
[16455.96s -> 16458.58s]  Can I turn it into anything?
[16458.58s -> 16459.58s]  No.
[16459.58s -> 16462.33s]  I think it's time to sell this.
[16464.33s -> 16467.68s]  Yeah.
[16467.68s -> 16471.52s]  How long were you out there looking for the ice clasp?
[16471.52s -> 16475.52s]  Like in that mess of bullshit we fought, I got one.
[16475.52s -> 16476.52s]  Not that long.
[16476.52s -> 16481.09s]  This thing's cool, but it's time to sell it.
[16481.09s -> 16482.09s]  It's going away.
[16482.09s -> 16484.55s]  Say goodbye.
[16484.55s -> 16493.32s]  This is just too good.
[16493.32s -> 16494.32s]  This is just too good.
[16494.32s -> 16496.20s]  All right.
[16496.20s -> 16498.20s]  Now those, I can make the boots, right?
[16501.12s -> 16502.12s]  Ice skates.
[16502.12s -> 16503.12s]  Ice skates.
[16503.12s -> 16504.36s]  What does it take?
[16504.36s -> 16506.36s]  You need leather.
[16506.36s -> 16507.36s]  I think there's some in there.
[16507.36s -> 16508.36s]  There's seven leathers.
[16508.36s -> 16510.36s]  Show the crafting guy the leather
[16510.36s -> 16511.36s]  and the boots will be on there.
[16511.36s -> 16513.36s]  And then see what else you need.
[16513.36s -> 16514.36s]  I don't think there's enough leather
[16514.36s -> 16516.36s]  and I don't even know what drops that.
[16516.36s -> 16518.36s]  You just kind of get it.
[16518.36s -> 16521.33s]  Okay.
[16521.33s -> 16523.33s]  I'm looking for the ice skates.
[16523.33s -> 16525.64s]  Ice skates require 20 ice blocks,
[16525.64s -> 16528.64s]  five leather and five, any iron bar.
[16528.64s -> 16533.31s]  Any iron bar.
[16533.31s -> 16537.28s]  We don't have iron bars, do we?
[16537.28s -> 16540.09s]  Lead is the same thing.
[16540.09s -> 16541.09s]  It is.
[16541.09s -> 16543.09s]  Do we have any lead bars?
[16543.09s -> 16544.09s]  A few.
[16544.09s -> 16546.09s]  We need five.
[16546.09s -> 16550.51s]  What's the best place to find any iron bar?
[16550.51s -> 16551.51s]  Iron or lead?
[16551.51s -> 16553.51s]  What's the best place to find it?
[16553.51s -> 16554.88s]  Underground.
[16554.88s -> 16555.88s]  Not too deep.
[16555.88s -> 16556.88s]  Just somewhere.
[16556.88s -> 16557.88s]  There's honestly going to be a lot of it.
[16557.88s -> 16559.88s]  We just kind of ignored it.
[16559.88s -> 16585.09s]  Desert fossil?
[16585.09s -> 16589.06s]  We need desert fossil for anything?
[16589.06s -> 16594.08s]  Hold on.
[16594.08s -> 16595.08s]  First of all.
[16595.08s -> 16603.29s]  Okay.
[16603.29s -> 16606.26s]  Unholy arrow.
[16606.26s -> 16608.26s]  I'm just looking for iron.
[16608.26s -> 16617.35s]  Oh, you gave me 5,000 torches
[16617.35s -> 16619.35s]  and I put them all in the trash.
[16619.35s -> 16623.29s]  And by trash I mean the deposit.
[16623.29s -> 16629.37s]  What the hell is making that noise?
[16629.37s -> 16634.43s]  Is that lead right here?
[16634.43s -> 16637.37s]  Hardened sandstone.
[16637.37s -> 16638.37s]  There we go.
[16638.37s -> 16643.00s]  Lead.
[16643.00s -> 16672.60s]  Tin.
[16672.60s -> 16674.60s]  This tin doesn't count as iron, right?
[16674.60s -> 16679.20s]  I don't think so.
[16679.20s -> 16693.03s]  Lead right here?
[16693.03s -> 16701.24s]  I think I have enough.
[16701.24s -> 16704.02s]  Lead.
[16704.02s -> 16706.02s]  How much lead ore makes a bar too?
[16706.02s -> 16710.97s]  Something like that.
[16710.97s -> 16719.70s]  Three.
[16719.70s -> 16720.70s]  Okay.
[16720.70s -> 16733.05s]  I should have enough after this.
[16733.05s -> 16735.74s]  Some more right here.
[16735.74s -> 16736.74s]  Hey, hey Jemba.
[16736.74s -> 16739.56s]  Hey, what's up?
[16739.56s -> 16742.56s]  I got a blazing heart for you.
[16742.56s -> 16743.56s]  Ooh.
[16743.56s -> 16746.56s]  That's not, that's not like emotional.
[16746.56s -> 16749.56s]  That's like I actually have it.
[16749.56s -> 16751.56s]  Do you now?
[16751.56s -> 16754.63s]  Well, I appreciate it.
[16754.63s -> 16756.63s]  Three, six, nine, 12, 15.
[16756.63s -> 16757.63s]  I need five.
[16757.63s -> 16760.63s]  It's just lead ore in the box, right?
[16760.63s -> 16762.93s]  Like three or four.
[16762.93s -> 16763.93s]  I need five, right?
[16763.93s -> 16765.93s]  I think I just put some in actually.
[16765.93s -> 16775.81s]  Yeah.
[16775.81s -> 16777.81s]  Here is the blazing heart.
[16777.81s -> 16780.05s]  Woohoo.
[16780.05s -> 16783.05s]  You can also craft blazing hearts to get your health to 400,
[16783.05s -> 16784.05s]  but you need hellstone.
[16784.05s -> 16787.05s]  So if you like spend the time to do it.
[16787.05s -> 16789.38s]  All right.
[16789.38s -> 16792.81s]  I'm going to make those boots.
[16792.81s -> 16798.93s]  Lead bar.
[16798.93s -> 16802.45s]  I'm going to go try and kill a harpy.
[16802.45s -> 16803.45s]  I think.
[16803.45s -> 16805.45s]  Do you say that there was lead ore in here?
[16805.45s -> 16806.95s]  I think so.
[16806.95s -> 16812.13s]  Yes, there is.
[16812.13s -> 16815.13s]  Oh wait, I was crafting the freaking dummy thing.
[16815.13s -> 16816.13s]  Okay.
[16816.13s -> 16820.84s]  So easy to forget what you're doing in Terraria.
[16820.84s -> 16821.84s]  Yeah, it is.
[16821.84s -> 16827.66s]  Especially at a point in a game like this where you're instantly thrown this many new items.
[16827.66s -> 16829.66s]  Yeah, it's really overwhelming, but it's a lot of fun.
[16829.66s -> 16830.66s]  All right.
[16830.66s -> 16832.66s]  So I have everything I need.
[16832.66s -> 16834.54s]  Ice skates.
[16834.54s -> 16841.86s]  Pass them?
[16841.86s -> 16851.01s]  Oh, I have to do it over here.
[16851.01s -> 16854.04s]  Where's the loom?
[16854.04s -> 16860.64s]  Where's the loom?
[16860.64s -> 16864.32s]  Oh, it has to be in the inventory.
[16864.32s -> 16868.51s]  Yeah.
[16868.51s -> 16878.77s]  What am I missing in my inventory?
[16878.77s -> 16885.81s]  Ice, lead, leather, and then like what am I missing?
[16885.81s -> 16896.04s]  What the fuck am I missing?
[16896.04s -> 16904.19s]  What are you trying to do?
[16904.19s -> 16906.19s]  You might be at the wrong crafting station.
[16906.19s -> 16907.19s]  Ice skates?
[16907.19s -> 16908.19s]  Ice skates.
[16908.19s -> 16911.00s]  You have to stand near this thing over here.
[16911.00s -> 16914.70s]  The ice creator.
[16914.70s -> 16916.70s]  Oh, there's an ice creator.
[16916.70s -> 16917.70s]  Okay.
[16917.70s -> 16918.70s]  Yeah.
[16918.70s -> 16919.70s]  I got annoyed at the same thing.
[16919.70s -> 16920.70s]  All right.
[16920.70s -> 16925.70s]  So I got the ice skates and now I'm going to make the super duper super boots.
[16925.70s -> 16930.08s]  Okay, chat.
[16930.08s -> 16937.95s]  Like what the fuck was I doing with the purified shards?
[16937.95s -> 16942.66s]  Do I have to go to a different table for this one too?
[16942.66s -> 16944.96s]  Is there another table?
[16944.96s -> 16945.96s]  I have to take the boots off.
[16945.96s -> 16946.96s]  Okay.
[16946.96s -> 16963.16s]  Am I losing my mind right now?
[16963.16s -> 16969.79s]  Or the tinker table?
[16969.79s -> 16977.12s]  Which one of these is the tinker table?
[16977.12s -> 16982.76s]  Tinker table on the left.
[16982.76s -> 16990.12s]  Far right.
[16990.12s -> 16992.12s]  Tinker table on the left.
[16992.12s -> 16993.12s]  On the far right.
[16993.12s -> 16997.72s]  Okay, there it is.
[16997.72s -> 17007.16s]  Oh, I keep muting.
[17007.16s -> 17009.16s]  Here, try this accessory.
[17009.16s -> 17011.16s]  I don't know if you're going to actually use it.
[17011.16s -> 17012.84s]  But here.
[17012.84s -> 17018.75s]  I'm just going to look at the louse flight super fast running extra mobility on ice.
[17018.75s -> 17019.75s]  Seven percent degrees movement speed.
[17019.75s -> 17023.27s]  So this is just, we just keep going.
[17023.27s -> 17026.92s]  So it's super fast.
[17026.92s -> 17028.92s]  Faster than incredibly fast.
[17028.92s -> 17031.92s]  One can only assume.
[17031.92s -> 17034.92s]  I mean, they'll sound pretty, pretty good.
[17034.92s -> 17038.15s]  Okay.
[17038.15s -> 17040.15s]  Now what can I do with this?
[17040.15s -> 17045.20s]  I can do more than this?
[17045.20s -> 17047.85s]  No, no.
[17047.85s -> 17049.85s]  It's just that it's not.
[17049.85s -> 17050.85s]  It's not.
[17050.85s -> 17051.85s]  You can't.
[17051.85s -> 17052.85s]  This is the end.
[17052.85s -> 17054.85s]  Oh my God.
[17054.85s -> 17059.42s]  Angel treads.
[17059.42s -> 17064.71s]  Extreme speed.
[17064.71s -> 17069.71s]  Water and lava walking and temporary immunity to lava.
[17069.71s -> 17074.33s]  Enhanced ability to walk on water, ice, fire blocks and lava allows flight as the
[17074.33s -> 17076.33s]  wearer can run incredibly fast.
[17076.33s -> 17080.88s]  These seem like better, right?
[17080.88s -> 17082.88s]  That's a lot of bars.
[17082.88s -> 17088.00s]  But whatever.
[17088.00s -> 17090.00s]  I mean, let's how fast is fast?
[17090.00s -> 17092.00s]  Super fast.
[17092.00s -> 17098.14s]  Let's just run.
[17098.14s -> 17105.93s]  I mean, that's that's pretty fast.
[17105.93s -> 17116.49s]  Can I fly for longer too?
[17116.49s -> 17117.49s]  Not really.
[17117.49s -> 17120.95s]  Hey, you want to want to assist me?
[17120.95s -> 17122.95s]  Yeah, I just was looking at the thing I just made.
[17122.95s -> 17125.38s]  Yeah.
[17125.38s -> 17127.71s]  Okay.
[17127.71s -> 17128.71s]  You gave me.
[17128.71s -> 17129.71s]  Did you check the accessory I gave you?
[17129.71s -> 17130.71s]  Fear monger.
[17130.71s -> 17133.65s]  5% reduced damage taken.
[17133.65s -> 17135.65s]  Enemies are less likely to target you.
[17135.65s -> 17138.92s]  Um, it's not that good.
[17138.92s -> 17142.95s]  But no, what can it turn into?
[17142.95s -> 17148.13s]  You combine it with some healer item I don't have to get.
[17148.13s -> 17151.13s]  And then it like reduces damage to the allies around you.
[17151.13s -> 17153.69s]  Oh, that's cool.
[17153.69s -> 17162.56s]  5% reduced damage taken versus 4 defense and 1% damage reduction.
[17162.56s -> 17169.30s]  What turns out to be more damage mitigation?
[17169.30s -> 17175.30s]  I'm saying 5% less damage or 1% less damage and 4 defense.
[17175.30s -> 17177.30s]  Anybody know?
[17177.30s -> 17178.30s]  5%.
[17178.30s -> 17179.30s]  5%.
[17179.30s -> 17180.30s]  I had to guess.
[17180.30s -> 17186.00s]  Well, we'll get it on there then.
[17186.00s -> 17187.43s]  No more bees.
[17187.43s -> 17189.43s]  What can I do with bees?
[17189.43s -> 17195.60s]  Honey balloon.
[17195.60s -> 17196.60s]  That's cool.
[17196.60s -> 17197.60s]  All right.
[17197.60s -> 17204.34s]  Assist.
[17204.34s -> 17205.34s]  Plague hive.
[17205.34s -> 17207.58s]  I mean, there's a lot of stuff.
[17207.58s -> 17209.58s]  This is what I was saying.
[17209.58s -> 17215.82s]  This is like going to the bakery and the chocolate factory at the same time.
[17215.82s -> 17219.82s]  And they just say, hey, by the way, Jeremy, everything is free today.
[17219.82s -> 17223.82s]  But you can only have 10 things.
[17223.82s -> 17226.82s]  You can have anything you want, but you can only pick 10.
[17226.82s -> 17230.82s]  It's more like you can have whatever you want.
[17230.82s -> 17235.82s]  You can have whatever you want, but you need to learn and understand what all the ingredients are first.
[17235.82s -> 17237.82s]  No.
[17237.82s -> 17249.21s]  As long as you can prove to us that you know the recipe, we'll give it to you for free.
[17249.21s -> 17253.21s]  I mean, that looks really good, but how do they possibly get all the pastry in there?
[17253.21s -> 17256.21s]  How do you get the chocolate sprinkles on there to stick?
[17256.21s -> 17260.21s]  Sorry, motherfucker.
[17261.21s -> 17263.21s]  I know how to make the meringue.
[17263.21s -> 17265.21s]  It's eggs and lemon.
[17265.21s -> 17266.21s]  Okay.
[17266.21s -> 17270.16s]  What else?
[17270.16s -> 17272.91s]  A wormhole to me.
[17272.91s -> 17274.91s]  We're about to get fucking crazy.
[17274.91s -> 17275.91s]  What?
[17275.91s -> 17276.91s]  Hold on.
[17276.91s -> 17278.85s]  I don't have anything.
[17278.85s -> 17279.85s]  Do I have?
[17279.85s -> 17280.85s]  Let me deposit my...
[17280.85s -> 17281.85s]  Hold on.
[17281.85s -> 17283.85s]  You need me now.
[17283.85s -> 17284.85s]  Wait.
[17284.85s -> 17285.85s]  Hold on.
[17285.85s -> 17286.85s]  Seriously.
[17286.85s -> 17288.85s]  Do you want to fight a boss or no?
[17288.85s -> 17292.28s]  I do, but there are too many fucking ingredients on the table.
[17292.28s -> 17294.28s]  I mean, you're going to have more after this boss.
[17294.28s -> 17295.28s]  Oh my god.
[17295.28s -> 17296.28s]  Okay.
[17296.28s -> 17297.28s]  I guess I'm coming to you.
[17297.28s -> 17300.36s]  Quick, before this blizzard ends.
[17300.36s -> 17302.36s]  I don't even know where the fuck you are.
[17302.36s -> 17304.36s]  Wormhole potion.
[17304.36s -> 17306.36s]  I'm on the map right now and I don't even see you.
[17306.36s -> 17308.36s]  To the right.
[17308.36s -> 17315.46s]  Wormhole potion.
[17315.46s -> 17317.46s]  I'm doing a...
[17317.46s -> 17320.28s]  I'm here.
[17320.28s -> 17322.28s]  You have all your stuff summoned?
[17322.28s -> 17323.28s]  I've got all my stuff.
[17323.28s -> 17327.46s]  Is this going to be hard?
[17327.46s -> 17329.76s]  I don't know.
[17329.76s -> 17332.26s]  Dude, I don't know.
[17333.26s -> 17343.76s]  Honestly, it's hard to gauge
[17343.76s -> 17345.76s]  because I fought a lot of these things a little bit late
[17345.76s -> 17346.76s]  the last time I played.
[17346.76s -> 17348.76s]  So I was already too strong.
[17348.76s -> 17350.76s]  But also you have seven ice claspers
[17350.76s -> 17351.76s]  or whatever you have.
[17351.76s -> 17355.68s]  Also, I have one.
[17355.68s -> 17357.68s]  So it's just...
[17357.68s -> 17359.95s]  It's just...
[17359.95s -> 17361.95s]  It's murder, dude.
[17361.95s -> 17369.63s]  We're going to do another one.
[17369.63s -> 17372.12s]  I might have done two.
[17372.12s -> 17374.12s]  I don't know if the second one's full.
[17374.12s -> 17382.21s]  Oh no.
[17382.21s -> 17384.21s]  I tried the strategy and it didn't work
[17384.21s -> 17385.21s]  because I'm stupid.
[17385.21s -> 17395.96s]  I'm fucking dying like a dumbass.
[17395.96s -> 17396.96s]  Drops a lot of health.
[17396.96s -> 17397.96s]  Go pick it up.
[17397.96s -> 17408.80s]  Go pick them up.
[17408.80s -> 17409.80s]  I'm going to be real with you.
[17409.80s -> 17413.80s]  I just can't even tell if there's anything on the screen.
[17413.80s -> 17414.80s]  Everything is so...
[17414.80s -> 17415.80s]  It's so dark.
[17415.80s -> 17416.80s]  The blizzard is rough.
[17416.80s -> 17417.80s]  You're dying, man.
[17417.80s -> 17418.80s]  Do you have healing potions?
[17418.80s -> 17420.80s]  Yeah, I'm good.
[17420.80s -> 17429.10s]  The thing that mine dropped was pretty shitty.
[17429.10s -> 17431.92s]  I don't know what you got.
[17431.92s -> 17433.09s]  Ice golem.
[17433.09s -> 17435.09s]  Another ice golem.
[17435.09s -> 17445.16s]  Also, actually, for a summon boy,
[17445.16s -> 17446.16s]  if you go up in the sky,
[17446.16s -> 17448.16s]  you can fight the wind elemental
[17448.16s -> 17449.16s]  and then you get an accessory item
[17449.16s -> 17451.85s]  that just like...
[17451.85s -> 17452.85s]  Really?
[17452.85s -> 17454.85s]  Where you constantly have a wind elemental
[17454.85s -> 17456.85s]  that follows you.
[17456.85s -> 17458.28s]  What did he drop?
[17458.28s -> 17459.97s]  Anything good?
[17459.97s -> 17461.97s]  I think he dropped a lot of it down the hole
[17461.97s -> 17463.97s]  and not really.
[17463.97s -> 17469.05s]  Blizzard.
[17469.05s -> 17476.05s]  We're still kind of hanging out
[17476.05s -> 17478.05s]  waiting for another one to spawn.
[17478.05s -> 17490.04s]  He dropped an essence.
[17490.04s -> 17492.48s]  He dropped a frost...
[17492.48s -> 17493.48s]  Barner?
[17493.48s -> 17494.48s]  Frost Barney?
[17494.48s -> 17498.96s]  Frost Barrier.
[17498.96s -> 17501.88s]  Ooh, nice.
[17501.88s -> 17502.88s]  Lucky shackle.
[17502.88s -> 17503.88s]  Oh, God.
[17503.88s -> 17504.88s]  I don't even know what my summons are.
[17504.88s -> 17516.53s]  They're just running around aimlessly.
[17516.53s -> 17528.69s]  I'm trying to summon another boss
[17528.69s -> 17530.69s]  and it's not happening.
[17530.69s -> 17534.04s]  Amarok?
[17534.04s -> 17540.08s]  Let me go.
[17540.08s -> 17541.08s]  Here he is.
[17541.08s -> 17552.37s]  This music is so loud.
[17552.37s -> 17553.37s]  Is it just me?
[17553.37s -> 17557.37s]  It's just like louder music than every other boss.
[17557.37s -> 17560.37s]  My music's turned down.
[17560.37s -> 17561.37s]  What's that?
[17561.37s -> 17568.01s]  Dangerous glacier.
[17568.01s -> 17570.57s]  It's not very good.
[17570.57s -> 17574.52s]  Yeah, I don't know what this boss's drop pool is,
[17574.52s -> 17576.52s]  but I'm not impressed.
[17581.47s -> 17582.47s]  I've got to stand still.
[17582.47s -> 17592.92s]  I've got to read you.
[17592.92s -> 17595.92s]  I want to make sure they're all still alive.
[17595.92s -> 17599.92s]  How many fucking torches did you put on this house?
[17599.92s -> 17601.29s]  What?
[17601.29s -> 17602.29s]  What are you talking about?
[17602.29s -> 17603.29s]  I don't know.
[17603.29s -> 17604.29s]  Nothing.
[17604.29s -> 17605.29s]  Where?
[17605.29s -> 17606.29s]  Nowhere.
[17606.29s -> 17607.29s]  Show me.
[17607.29s -> 17608.29s]  The house over to the right.
[17608.29s -> 17610.29s]  The random generated house.
[17610.29s -> 17614.90s]  I don't know.
[17614.90s -> 17616.90s]  There's a torch on every tile in front of it.
[17616.90s -> 17618.90s]  Like, no space between them.
[17618.90s -> 17623.72s]  I don't know.
[17623.72s -> 17627.37s]  Sometimes I get scared, man.
[17627.37s -> 17629.37s]  Pirates are approaching from the west.
[17629.37s -> 17630.37s]  Fuck.
[17630.37s -> 17631.37s]  Go back to the base.
[17631.37s -> 17634.83s]  Tell me when you're there, because I need to wormhole on you.
[17634.83s -> 17635.83s]  I'm here.
[17635.83s -> 17638.90s]  I'm at the base.
[17638.90s -> 17640.90s]  Okay, they'll be here soon.
[17640.90s -> 17642.08s]  They're kind of annoying.
[17642.08s -> 17643.08s]  There's no doors.
[17643.08s -> 17644.08s]  They're just like every other invasion.
[17644.08s -> 17646.08s]  Pirate captains kind of hurt.
[17646.08s -> 17650.08s]  They drop a absolute shit ton of gold.
[17650.08s -> 17651.08s]  Really?
[17651.08s -> 17654.08s]  So we want to be here to kill them.
[17654.08s -> 17660.18s]  It is.
[17660.18s -> 17661.18s]  I'm just going to have to deposit it.
[17661.18s -> 17663.18s]  I will have to look at it later.
[17663.18s -> 17664.18s]  I'm going to have to look at it later.
[17664.18s -> 17665.18s]  It's all in there.
[17665.18s -> 17666.18s]  I don't know.
[17666.18s -> 17668.74s]  I'll check it out later.
[17668.74s -> 17683.01s]  The pirates have arrived.
[17683.01s -> 17687.49s]  Honestly, you're probably going to auto kill a lot of them.
[17687.49s -> 17690.49s]  Especially if they walk this way, because I have the lava ground,
[17690.49s -> 17693.49s]  and they don't give a shit about lava.
[17693.49s -> 17695.49s]  Yeah, they really don't.
[17695.49s -> 17718.49s]  What about the other side?
[17718.49s -> 17722.95s]  If you stay on this side, then they probably won't spawn on the other side.
[17722.95s -> 17723.95s]  They're coming in here.
[17723.95s -> 17724.95s]  This door is open.
[17724.95s -> 17727.95s]  If we shut the door, they shouldn't be able to get in that door.
[17728.95s -> 17732.76s]  Nothing despawns in Terraria, right?
[17732.76s -> 17733.76s]  It just stays there.
[17733.76s -> 17734.76s]  It's like money.
[17734.76s -> 17736.76s]  Or should we go collect it from time to time?
[17736.76s -> 17739.07s]  I actually don't know.
[17739.07s -> 17742.56s]  I think it's a lot different between multiplayer and single player.
[17742.56s -> 17758.82s]  Well, I got some.
[17758.82s -> 17778.49s]  There are more than 4,000 items on the ground.
[17778.49s -> 17785.72s]  It starts to despawn.
[17785.72s -> 17787.72s]  Well, now there's 3,415.
[17787.72s -> 17803.47s]  That's a lot of stuff.
[17803.47s -> 17807.32s]  There's like a...
[17807.32s -> 17810.00s]  Oh my God, there's so much stuff.
[17810.00s -> 17813.44s]  You can drop like golden toilets and stuff as well.
[17813.44s -> 17818.62s]  You're going to want to sell that.
[17818.62s -> 17819.62s]  Oh, man.
[17819.62s -> 17822.62s]  We might have to destroy a pirate ship.
[17822.62s -> 17824.62s]  I'm surprised we haven't seen it yet.
[17824.62s -> 17834.92s]  That would be the pirate...
[17834.92s -> 17836.92s]  Whoa!
[17836.92s -> 17837.92s]  What?
[17837.92s -> 17840.92s]  It just crashed into the side.
[17842.92s -> 17845.10s]  Here we come!
[17845.10s -> 17847.10s]  Somebody's just like...
[17847.10s -> 17850.98s]  Somebody didn't know how to break.
[17850.98s -> 17857.76s]  Full speed ahead.
[17857.76s -> 17864.00s]  There it is.
[17864.00s -> 17866.00s]  Okay.
[17866.00s -> 17869.90s]  Oh, look at all that stuff.
[17869.90s -> 17870.90s]  Oh, no, it's not the pirate ship.
[17870.90s -> 17872.90s]  Boom!
[17872.90s -> 17874.59s]  Oh, where'd it go?
[17874.59s -> 17876.59s]  The flying Dutchman.
[17876.59s -> 17885.19s]  Here she comes.
[17885.19s -> 17892.06s]  Come on, fire.
[17892.06s -> 17893.06s]  Why isn't there fire?
[17893.06s -> 17895.58s]  Get in there.
[17895.58s -> 17897.58s]  Be brave, you pile of shit.
[17897.58s -> 17905.00s]  Be brave, fuckers.
[17905.00s -> 17911.47s]  Be brave, all horses, asses.
[17911.47s -> 17919.51s]  You bitches.
[17919.51s -> 17922.45s]  We done died today.
[17922.45s -> 17925.04s]  That game.
[17925.04s -> 17927.34s]  What a game.
[17927.34s -> 17929.34s]  We should probably make sure we have everything.
[17929.34s -> 17934.55s]  I did get a tuba.
[17934.55s -> 17935.55s]  You're right.
[17935.55s -> 17941.37s]  What does a tuba do in this game?
[17941.37s -> 17943.68s]  That's one gold 57...
[17943.68s -> 17944.68s]  Holy shit.
[17944.68s -> 17952.60s]  There's a whole bard class that attacks with music and buffs allies around them.
[17952.60s -> 17956.44s]  Well, that was insane.
[17956.44s -> 17958.94s]  That's a lot of stuff.
[17958.94s -> 17962.65s]  Did we get everything?
[17962.65s -> 17964.15s]  I think so.
[17964.15s -> 17966.22s]  I'm just checking.
[17966.22s -> 17972.52s]  I don't want to leave one piece of silver on the ground.
[17972.52s -> 17979.79s]  How come a golden toilet is two gold and a golden piano is 60 copper?
[17979.79s -> 17983.24s]  Let's see what we got.
[17983.24s -> 17987.11s]  Golden bathtub.
[17987.11s -> 17992.23s]  You can sell this to anybody, right?
[17992.23s -> 17995.75s]  Does it matter who you sell it to?
[17995.75s -> 17996.75s]  No, right?
[17996.75s -> 17997.75s]  Two gold.
[17997.75s -> 18003.96s]  Nearby players get a bonus against pirate corsair.
[18003.96s -> 18008.09s]  24-carat tuba.
[18008.09s -> 18012.38s]  50 symphonic damage.
[18012.38s -> 18014.38s]  Four crit.
[18014.38s -> 18016.38s]  Launches an explosive burst of sound.
[18016.38s -> 18018.38s]  Damage empowers players with bonus.
[18018.38s -> 18019.38s]  Damage reduction 11.
[18019.38s -> 18026.29s]  Holy shit.
[18026.29s -> 18027.29s]  Golden clock.
[18027.29s -> 18030.75s]  Guarding gold ring.
[18030.75s -> 18035.23s]  Increases coin pickup range.
[18035.23s -> 18039.23s]  Two defense and almost 0.5% damage reduction.
[18039.23s -> 18044.73s]  Golden door.
[18044.73s -> 18045.73s]  Can we have a golden door?
[18045.73s -> 18046.73s]  What?
[18046.73s -> 18050.02s]  Golden door?
[18050.02s -> 18051.02s]  I didn't get one.
[18051.02s -> 18052.02s]  I got one.
[18052.02s -> 18053.02s]  Do you want to put it there?
[18053.02s -> 18054.71s]  Do you?
[18054.71s -> 18055.71s]  No.
[18055.71s -> 18057.14s]  Okay.
[18057.14s -> 18059.14s]  Flying Dutchman trophy.
[18059.14s -> 18062.34s]  Holy shit.
[18062.34s -> 18065.28s]  Zealous hand cannon.
[18065.28s -> 18067.28s]  82 range damage.
[18067.28s -> 18069.28s]  Almost 10% crit chance.
[18069.28s -> 18073.57s]  Is that that stupid KO fist?
[18073.57s -> 18075.57s]  No, it's a big cannon.
[18075.57s -> 18078.45s]  Can I see it?
[18078.45s -> 18079.45s]  Where are you?
[18079.45s -> 18083.06s]  Oh yeah.
[18083.06s -> 18086.99s]  Golden charge.
[18086.99s -> 18090.00s]  Golden table.
[18090.00s -> 18096.33s]  Golden platform.
[18096.33s -> 18097.33s]  Garo's breath.
[18098.33s -> 18102.60s]  Oh, I think it uses the grenade shells or magnum rounds or whatever.
[18102.60s -> 18103.60s]  Okay.
[18103.60s -> 18106.22s]  It's a golden toilet.
[18106.22s -> 18108.78s]  And then a golden chair.
[18108.78s -> 18116.24s]  Don't shoot it in the house.
[18116.24s -> 18120.08s]  I mean, I wasn't planning on it.
[18120.08s -> 18125.33s]  Give the rounds.
[18125.33s -> 18127.33s]  Do you want the seating charge?
[18127.33s -> 18130.53s]  I have a lot of those here too.
[18130.53s -> 18131.53s]  Oh no.
[18131.53s -> 18133.53s]  Do you still use that honeycomb?
[18133.53s -> 18135.90s]  I have it.
[18135.90s -> 18136.90s]  Do you want it?
[18136.90s -> 18139.46s]  Yeah.
[18139.46s -> 18149.42s]  I'm curious if this ever makes anything good eventually.
[18149.42s -> 18150.42s]  I just gave it to you.
[18150.42s -> 18151.42s]  All right.
[18151.42s -> 18153.42s]  I want to just play with the tuba for a second.
[18153.42s -> 18155.66s]  I just want to know what it does.
[18155.66s -> 18156.84s]  Yeah.
[18156.84s -> 18165.60s]  That's what it does.
[18165.60s -> 18168.29s]  So it just shoots up with a little bit of grenades.
[18168.29s -> 18181.35s]  They don't go very far.
[18181.35s -> 18182.35s]  All right.
[18182.35s -> 18184.55s]  Well, that's cool.
[18184.55s -> 18186.55s]  I can turn it into anything?
[18186.55s -> 18187.55s]  No.
[18187.55s -> 18189.30s]  I'm just selling it.
[18189.30s -> 18191.30s]  Unless you want it for anything.
[18191.30s -> 18193.48s]  It's not a material or anything.
[18193.48s -> 18194.48s]  No.
[18194.48s -> 18196.48s]  I don't.
[18209.88s -> 18211.83s]  Stone.
[18211.83s -> 18216.90s]  What about this captain's foie gras?
[18216.90s -> 18220.29s]  Thrower class?
[18220.29s -> 18223.00s]  Sell them?
[18223.00s -> 18224.00s]  The what?
[18224.00s -> 18227.00s]  The captain's, like, the thrower?
[18227.00s -> 18228.00s]  Give it to me.
[18228.00s -> 18230.00s]  I'm doing throwing weapons now.
[18230.00s -> 18234.79s]  Damn, that's a lot.
[18234.79s -> 18235.79s]  That is a lot.
[18235.79s -> 18239.55s]  They're pretty good too.
[18239.55s -> 18241.55s]  Flying Dutchman trophy, I'm assuming he's not.
[18241.55s -> 18243.55s]  OK, this guardian gold ring, I think, is pretty rare.
[18243.55s -> 18251.97s]  What can you do with it?
[18251.97s -> 18252.97s]  Coin ring.
[18252.97s -> 18256.07s]  Really?
[18256.07s -> 18262.27s]  It increases coin pickup range, and hitting enemies will sometimes drop extra coins.
[18262.27s -> 18273.98s]  I mean, rare doesn't usually mean always good.
[18273.98s -> 18275.98s]  Well, let's put him onto it.
[18275.98s -> 18287.05s]  Where's Popo?
[18287.05s -> 18289.51s]  Hey, put this door on.
[18289.51s -> 18291.13s]  No, potion.
[18291.13s -> 18296.38s]  Put that golden door somewhere.
[18296.38s -> 18299.38s]  Why can't you?
[18299.38s -> 18306.76s]  I don't understand.
[18306.76s -> 18312.12s]  Where the fuck is Popo?
[18314.12s -> 18320.34s]  I could have just turned around and just placed it, but I don't know.
[18320.34s -> 18322.34s]  I don't know why it was.
[18322.34s -> 18324.34s]  You know, it's your server.
[18324.34s -> 18325.34s]  I feel like it's a golden door.
[18325.34s -> 18331.34s]  You get the honors to, like, put the golden door up, I think, somewhere in my brain.
[18331.34s -> 18333.34s]  Yeah, I deserved the honor.
[18333.34s -> 18334.34s]  He doesn't know how.
[18334.34s -> 18337.48s]  Yes, I do.
[18337.48s -> 18338.48s]  See?
[18338.48s -> 18340.48s]  OK, I know how to put a door up.
[18340.48s -> 18343.44s]  I needed to prove that right away.
[18343.44s -> 18345.44s]  Why am I on fire?
[18345.44s -> 18350.04s]  Am I burning?
[18350.04s -> 18356.04s]  I think those are your shoes that you're wearing, that you're just not used to, that you light on fire when you run.
[18356.04s -> 18358.90s]  What?
[18358.90s -> 18361.48s]  No.
[18361.48s -> 18362.48s]  You just look cool.
[18362.48s -> 18366.16s]  No, this is happening when I get home in the house.
[18366.16s -> 18367.16s]  Oh, that's...
[18367.16s -> 18369.16s]  I built...
[18369.16s -> 18370.33s]  Where is it?
[18370.33s -> 18373.56s]  Where the hell did I put it?
[18373.56s -> 18376.56s]  I need a staff.
[18376.56s -> 18377.56s]  I want a staff.
[18377.56s -> 18378.56s]  I think you're standing in front of it.
[18378.56s -> 18379.56s]  It makes us run faster.
[18379.56s -> 18382.86s]  It's the torch that's there.
[18382.86s -> 18384.86s]  This thing is, like, fun.
[18384.86s -> 18385.86s]  This summons the spheres.
[18385.86s -> 18390.04s]  This summons the ice chunks.
[18390.04s -> 18393.04s]  This summons the skulls that shoot after a second.
[18393.04s -> 18396.66s]  I want a staff.
[18396.66s -> 18399.66s]  Then we're going to have to start doing the mechanical boss.
[18399.66s -> 18400.66s]  Annoying glacial sting.
[18400.66s -> 18403.28s]  Do you want this?
[18403.28s -> 18404.28s]  Oh, well, that's annoying.
[18404.28s -> 18405.28s]  Why would anybody want this?
[18405.28s -> 18407.65s]  Yeah, you're being very annoying right now.
[18407.65s -> 18409.65s]  That means, like, it sucks, right?
[18409.65s -> 18412.98s]  I mean, you can reforge it.
[18412.98s -> 18422.60s]  Oh.
[18422.60s -> 18429.77s]  How do you do that again?
[18429.77s -> 18432.77s]  What's a good thing to make for a pickaxe right now?
[18432.77s -> 18439.10s]  I'm actually forgetting what our next pickaxe progression is.
[18439.10s -> 18443.10s]  I think we're supposed to get cobalt, but I never can find cobalt.
[18443.10s -> 18447.10s]  Maybe it's because cobalt is something different on servers, like lead and iron.
[18447.10s -> 18448.66s]  Right.
[18448.66s -> 18452.65s]  But, oh, hell, that's why I was confused.
[18452.65s -> 18459.13s]  Okay, so I need to go smash more of those alters.
[18459.13s -> 18463.59s]  And then we can start getting better stuff.
[18463.59s -> 18465.98s]  Coming with you.
[18465.98s -> 18471.48s]  Oh, didn't you say to go, like, up in the sky?
[18471.48s -> 18475.43s]  I wanted to find the potion seller for gravity potions,
[18475.43s -> 18478.43s]  and then I was going to do sky stuff, but he wasn't there.
[18478.43s -> 18479.43s]  No.
[18479.43s -> 18482.24s]  I don't know if he's dead or what.
[18482.24s -> 18485.32s]  Trixie the party girl has arrived.
[18485.32s -> 18488.32s]  Yeah, she can go live in a dumpster for all I care.
[18488.32s -> 18490.32s]  Trixie the party girl?
[18490.32s -> 18492.32s]  Yeah, don't talk to her, Jerma.
[18492.32s -> 18493.32s]  Okay.
[18493.32s -> 18494.32s]  You're too good for her.
[18494.32s -> 18503.08s]  Oh, I'm Trixie. I like partying.
[18503.08s -> 18505.08s]  It's my whole identity.
[18505.08s -> 18507.84s]  All right.
[18508.84s -> 18510.84s]  You know, your parents are paying to go to college.
[18510.84s -> 18513.08s]  This is really respectful of you.
[18516.08s -> 18518.08s]  Whenever I go off on, like, a random tangent,
[18518.08s -> 18520.08s]  you start doing the...
[18521.08s -> 18522.08s]  He's not saying...
[18522.08s -> 18523.08s]  I'm just blocking it out.
[18523.08s -> 18526.08s]  I'm blocking out your, like, nonsense.
[18526.08s -> 18528.08s]  I already forgot. Where were we going?
[18528.08s -> 18530.08s]  I don't know. I'm following you.
[18530.08s -> 18532.08s]  Why were we going this way?
[18532.08s -> 18536.53s]  I don't know. You said I'm going to jump real quick.
[18537.53s -> 18540.35s]  Alters. Smash the altars.
[18544.65s -> 18547.65s]  I'm blocking out the crazy things you're saying.
[18547.65s -> 18554.56s]  The world has been blessed.
[18554.56s -> 18558.92s]  Did you bless the world?
[18558.92s -> 18560.92s]  Yeah, that's me destroying altars.
[18560.92s -> 18562.92s]  It adds new wars.
[18562.92s -> 18564.92s]  Wait a minute. Did I just pick up, like, fucking 50 gold?
[18564.92s -> 18567.54s]  Maybe.
[18567.54s -> 18569.54s]  Wait a minute.
[18569.54s -> 18577.35s]  I just saw gold.
[18577.35s -> 18587.08s]  What are you up to down there?
[18587.08s -> 18595.84s]  I'm coming to find out.
[18595.84s -> 18597.84s]  I love that when you show up near me,
[18597.84s -> 18601.84s]  it just means, like, 30 guys are going to go beat up somebody near me.
[18601.84s -> 18602.84s]  Oh, here's Jerma.
[18602.84s -> 18604.84s]  It's pretty great.
[18604.84s -> 18610.16s]  There's, like, a fucking sword over here.
[18610.16s -> 18613.40s]  Lazy Blitzzard?
[18613.40s -> 18616.98s]  This is a huge weapon over there.
[18616.98s -> 18618.98s]  I thought you said you collected everything.
[18622.05s -> 18624.42s]  That item's worth using for you
[18624.42s -> 18626.42s]  just because right-clicking makes you go fast.
[18626.42s -> 18628.79s]  If you hold down right-click with it,
[18628.79s -> 18630.79s]  you'll keep dashing.
[18630.79s -> 18633.54s]  Molten Pick?
[18633.54s -> 18635.54s]  God damn it.
[18635.54s -> 18637.54s]  Yeah, we haven't upgraded our pickaxe in, like, ever.
[18637.54s -> 18639.54s]  I'll be right back.
[18639.54s -> 18647.92s]  What? This is awesome.
[18647.92s -> 18649.92s]  Wait, no. Can you recall the base?
[18649.92s -> 18651.92s]  I'm going to be the base way quicker than you think.
[18651.92s -> 18661.33s]  Who needs a recall?
[18661.33s -> 18666.24s]  I mean...
[18666.24s -> 18668.24s]  Okay, bro.
[18668.24s -> 18670.24s]  Well, it's free, so fine.
[18670.24s -> 18672.61s]  What do you need?
[18672.61s -> 18674.61s]  I need to make a Molten Pickaxe so we can get the new pickaxe.
[18674.61s -> 18676.85s]  I need the Molten Ore.
[18676.85s -> 18680.05s]  This thing is pretty awesome.
[18680.05s -> 18682.05s]  Let me deposit this shit.
[18682.05s -> 18684.05s]  Desert, also, sandstone,
[18684.05s -> 18686.74s]  seed,
[18686.74s -> 18688.74s]  ock, blood droplet,
[18688.74s -> 18693.16s]  lens.
[18693.16s -> 18695.33s]  I need this pickaxe so I can get that pickaxe.
[18695.33s -> 18698.53s]  Mom?
[18698.53s -> 18700.53s]  Mom, everyone has the new pickaxe.
[18700.53s -> 18702.53s]  We forge it. Lazy is back.
[18702.53s -> 18704.53s]  Magma is wrong?
[18704.53s -> 18706.53s]  Molten is five hundred stones.
[18706.53s -> 18708.53s]  Okay, I need the other pickaxe, Mom.
[18708.53s -> 18710.53s]  You bought me the wrong one.
[18710.53s -> 18712.53s]  Minus five hundred percent speed?
[18712.53s -> 18714.53s]  Are they sure?
[18714.53s -> 18742.29s]  I need money.
[18742.29s -> 18749.46s]  Reforge.
[18749.46s -> 18757.96s]  Alright, we're good.
[18757.96s -> 18761.86s]  Superior.
[18761.86s -> 18768.07s]  I don't think that
[18768.07s -> 18773.44s]  debuff was working.
[18773.44s -> 18780.36s]  Maybe it was.
[18780.36s -> 18783.75s]  I need new armor.
[18783.75s -> 18785.75s]  So, can I upgrade this stuff?
[18785.75s -> 18787.75s]  Like the spirit trappers
[18787.75s -> 18793.64s]  stuff.
[18793.64s -> 18795.64s]  This thing looked like it was swinging really fast
[18795.64s -> 18797.64s]  when I did it last time.
[18797.64s -> 18800.90s]  No, it was swinging this fast before.
[18800.90s -> 18807.43s]  Jerma.
[18807.43s -> 18809.43s]  What's up?
[18809.43s -> 18811.43s]  It's fucking mission time. Mission time, alright.
[18811.43s -> 18813.60s]  I need your help in
[18813.60s -> 18815.60s]  locating the underground
[18815.60s -> 18818.10s]  granite subsystem.
[18818.10s -> 18821.03s]  Alright.
[18821.03s -> 18823.03s]  I understand. I think I can help you here.
[18823.03s -> 18826.55s]  You want the underground
[18826.55s -> 18828.55s]  granite subsystem.
[18828.55s -> 18830.55s]  Yeah, that's the subsystem.
[18830.55s -> 18837.97s]  What's your favorite pizza?
[18837.97s -> 18840.15s]  What's going on with all these people down here?
[18840.15s -> 18842.15s]  Did you put these people down here?
[18842.15s -> 18844.15s]  Yeah.
[18844.15s -> 18847.16s]  You're a fucking monster.
[18847.16s -> 18849.16s]  They're banished.
[18849.16s -> 18851.16s]  They're not even good enough for the prison.
[18851.16s -> 18853.91s]  At least let them
[18853.91s -> 18856.40s]  walk around down here.
[18856.40s -> 18858.40s]  No.
[18858.40s -> 18867.88s]  Why is it free wood in here?
[18867.88s -> 18871.46s]  What do you want down here?
[18871.46s -> 18873.46s]  Are you looking for the granite land?
[18873.46s -> 18875.46s]  It's like a purple looking area.
[18875.46s -> 18877.76s]  It's an area.
[18877.76s -> 18879.76s]  And we need it.
[18879.76s -> 18882.13s]  Purple looking area.
[18882.13s -> 18884.13s]  Yeah, it's fucking purple.
[18884.13s -> 18886.82s]  Alright, okay.
[18886.82s -> 18889.25s]  I don't know where it is.
[18889.25s -> 18891.94s]  So we kind of just have to explore.
[18891.94s -> 18893.94s]  How many torches do you have?
[18893.94s -> 18897.65s]  Did you use all the...
[18897.65s -> 18899.65s]  I gave you like 500.
[18899.65s -> 18901.65s]  Well, you did, but
[18901.65s -> 18903.65s]  let's see what's happening is
[18903.65s -> 18905.65s]  I have deposit all and I'm not all clicking them
[18905.65s -> 18907.65s]  and I deposit them all back in.
[18907.65s -> 18909.65s]  Okay, because you just deposit all.
[18909.65s -> 18911.65s]  That's all you ever do.
[18911.65s -> 18913.65s]  No, that's not true.
[18913.65s -> 18915.65s]  I do look at a lot of things.
[18915.65s -> 18917.65s]  I do go over lots of things.
[18917.65s -> 18919.65s]  But if you come to me
[18919.65s -> 18921.65s]  I have 1400 in hand.
[18921.65s -> 18923.65s]  Well, that's good.
[18923.65s -> 18928.13s]  There's a big fish down there.
[18928.13s -> 18934.96s]  Yeah, honey?
[18934.96s -> 18937.33s]  Look, a fish!
[18937.33s -> 18939.33s]  Alright, give me that shit.
[18939.33s -> 18941.33s]  Ah, dude, you know who I fucking need?
[18941.33s -> 18943.33s]  Here, you stay here.
[18943.33s -> 18945.33s]  God, I still don't have a fucking mirror.
[18948.47s -> 18950.47s]  Sorry, I'm having a meltdown.
[18950.47s -> 18954.18s]  Why don't you just take mine and then come back to me?
[18954.18s -> 18956.18s]  I can do that.
[18956.18s -> 18958.18s]  You better get this back.
[18958.18s -> 18961.62s]  Okay.
[18961.62s -> 18963.62s]  Why is it doing that?
[18963.62s -> 18966.69s]  Do you have an alt selected?
[18966.69s -> 18968.69s]  Oh, well, that would be a thing now, wouldn't it?
[18974.96s -> 18976.96s]  You're never getting this back.
[18976.96s -> 18980.23s]  Hey, it's Popo.
[18980.23s -> 18985.92s]  Glow sticks, cool.
[18985.92s -> 18987.92s]  That's one of my torches that you promised.
[18991.25s -> 18993.25s]  Do you want to find something specific?
[18993.25s -> 18996.39s]  You keep on going...
[18996.39s -> 18999.72s]  Uh...
[18999.72s -> 19001.89s]  Don't tell me what you're doing.
[19001.89s -> 19003.89s]  I forgot what I was doing.
[19003.89s -> 19005.89s]  We're doing a psychotic amulet.
[19005.89s -> 19015.30s]  Glow sticks are amazing.
[19015.30s -> 19017.30s]  They work in water. Nice.
[19017.30s -> 19020.82s]  Nice.
[19020.82s -> 19024.08s]  No, that's like, nice.
[19024.08s -> 19029.72s]  Oh, what's this?
[19029.72s -> 19031.72s]  I can't get this. This is too good of a material.
[19031.72s -> 19035.17s]  What is this?
[19035.17s -> 19037.17s]  That's why we're on this mission.
[19037.17s -> 19039.17s]  We need to find... I added the new resources to the world,
[19039.17s -> 19041.17s]  but we can't mine them yet.
[19041.17s -> 19043.17s]  So we need to find the
[19043.17s -> 19045.17s]  granite area.
[19045.17s -> 19047.35s]  Because there are...
[19047.35s -> 19049.35s]  There's a way to get a pickaxe from that.
[19049.35s -> 19053.57s]  Wait a minute. Hold on.
[19053.57s -> 19056.96s]  Purple.
[19056.96s -> 19058.96s]  Oh, shit. I know what I'm doing and I can't do it.
[19058.96s -> 19067.40s]  I can't fucking mine this either.
[19067.40s -> 19071.75s]  There's something over here too.
[19071.75s -> 19074.88s]  Where? In here?
[19074.88s -> 19076.88s]  Where's the heart?
[19076.88s -> 19089.36s]  There it is. A life crystal.
[19089.36s -> 19097.81s]  So,
[19097.81s -> 19099.81s]  we're trying to find the material to be able to get
[19099.81s -> 19101.81s]  new axes to be able to
[19101.81s -> 19103.81s]  mine the shit that's down here.
[19103.81s -> 19123.06s]  Use heart.
[19123.06s -> 19125.62s]  What? I can't.
[19125.62s -> 19128.69s]  Why does everybody keep telling me to do that?
[19128.69s -> 19144.55s]  Like, how...
[19144.55s -> 19146.55s]  Silt. Stone.
[19146.55s -> 19153.52s]  Stone. Stone.
[19153.52s -> 19155.52s]  Mine the tote pouch. Yes.
[19155.52s -> 19157.52s]  Yes, yes, yes.
[19157.52s -> 19159.52s]  Yes.
[19159.52s -> 19165.54s]  Don't mine the tote pouch. Don't listen to your chat.
[19165.54s -> 19168.80s]  You have one thing that you need to do.
[19168.80s -> 19170.80s]  And you have yet to
[19170.80s -> 19172.80s]  describe what that thing is.
[19172.80s -> 19174.80s]  The granite. It's a purple biome. You cannot miss it.
[19174.80s -> 19176.80s]  It is like a dark purple area.
[19176.80s -> 19178.80s]  It's somewhere underground.
[19178.80s -> 19180.80s]  Last time you tried to explain it, you went, uh...
[19180.80s -> 19184.13s]  That was like, I don't... What?
[19184.13s -> 19188.34s]  No.
[19188.34s -> 19190.34s]  You found it? It's... Oh, you did find it, you fuck.
[19190.34s -> 19193.41s]  Dirty fuck.
[19193.41s -> 19209.54s]  You are absolutely
[19209.54s -> 19212.55s]  filthy.
[19212.55s -> 19216.39s]  What are you guys talking about? Am I underwater?
[19216.39s -> 19219.08s]  Yes, I am.
[19219.08s -> 19221.08s]  Hey!
[19221.08s -> 19223.08s]  To your left, and that's a boss that spawned in it.
[19223.08s -> 19226.40s]  It should be really weak for
[19226.40s -> 19237.03s]  how strong we are right now.
[19237.03s -> 19240.80s]  This is a boss?
[19240.80s -> 19242.80s]  Do you listen to me?
[19242.80s -> 19244.80s]  I was saying, this is a boss?
[19244.80s -> 19246.80s]  Like, as in, it's not,
[19246.80s -> 19248.80s]  shouldn't be. It's like a standard enemy. Not, hey, is this a boss?
[19248.80s -> 19250.80s]  It's
[19250.80s -> 19252.80s]  from before hard mode.
[19252.80s -> 19254.80s]  I was mocking it.
[19254.80s -> 19256.80s]  Like, this is a boss?
[19256.80s -> 19258.80s]  No. You're covering for yourself.
[19258.80s -> 19260.80s]  I am not. I appreciate that you'd go to those lengths
[19260.80s -> 19262.80s]  to me. Listen to that clip, and you'll hear that it was like,
[19262.80s -> 19264.80s]  this is a boss?
[19264.80s -> 19271.40s]  Rannet block. Yeah.
[19271.40s -> 19275.11s]  This is a block?
[19275.11s -> 19277.11s]  Rannet? See, I'm not hearing it.
[19277.11s -> 19281.33s]  Energy core. Wound stone.
[19281.33s -> 19283.57s]  Ooh. Ooh.
[19283.57s -> 19285.57s]  There's a guy down here. There he is. Mr. Wizard.
[19285.57s -> 19288.71s]  Oh, he found him.
[19288.71s -> 19292.79s]  Where'd he go? Found the wizard.
[19292.79s -> 19294.79s]  Hey, friend, this bondage was starting to chafe.
[19294.79s -> 19299.01s]  Crystal ball.
[19299.01s -> 19302.02s]  Ice rod. Ooh.
[19302.02s -> 19304.02s]  Oh. Here. Take your stupid ice mirror.
[19304.02s -> 19307.28s]  29 damage.
[19307.28s -> 19310.36s]  Someone's a block of ice?
[19310.36s -> 19313.04s]  Is this any good?
[19313.04s -> 19316.44s]  Uh, I think his stuff is dated.
[19316.44s -> 19318.44s]  I'm not sure.
[19318.44s -> 19320.44s]  Crystal ball. Functions as a demon altar.
[19320.44s -> 19325.35s]  Guard thing.
[19325.35s -> 19327.35s]  Oh, dude, crystal ball. That's actually, I'm getting one.
[19327.35s -> 19329.35s]  Do you have 10 gold on you?
[19329.35s -> 19331.35s]  I have three.
[19331.35s -> 19334.10s]  Ah!
[19334.10s -> 19336.98s]  Isn't, what, aren't you gonna, like,
[19336.98s -> 19339.28s]  trap this guy somewhere?
[19339.28s -> 19341.28s]  Uh, I'm, yeah, he auto moves into
[19341.28s -> 19345.19s]  one of the trap houses.
[19345.19s -> 19347.19s]  He auto, hold on a minute.
[19347.19s -> 19349.19s]  He auto moves into one of the
[19349.19s -> 19351.19s]  trap houses. Yeah. Yeah.
[19351.19s -> 19353.19s]  He gets caught in the trap. How do you move in,
[19353.19s -> 19355.19s]  how do you move into a house that traps you?
[19355.19s -> 19357.19s]  Most of rap is
[19357.19s -> 19359.94s]  about this exact situation.
[19359.94s -> 19361.94s]  Here, will you take?
[19361.94s -> 19368.40s]  There's silver bars in here.
[19368.40s -> 19370.40s]  Oh, sick. We found a way to summon one of the
[19370.40s -> 19372.40s]  skeleton bot, uh, mechanical bots.
[19372.40s -> 19375.22s]  So we can do that.
[19375.22s -> 19377.22s]  And then you can use hollow bars to make a pickaxe,
[19377.22s -> 19379.22s]  right, chat, right?
[19379.22s -> 19381.22s]  Or does hollow bars not have a pickaxe?
[19381.22s -> 19391.20s]  Anybody know? Yes. Correct.
[19391.20s -> 19393.20s]  Yes. Everyone's saying yes.
[19393.20s -> 19396.58s]  Okay.
[19396.58s -> 19398.58s]  Hollow bars have a pickaxe. You also need the boss souls.
[19398.58s -> 19401.14s]  So yeah, we're gonna have to do all
[19401.14s -> 19403.14s]  the mechanical bosses then.
[19403.14s -> 19405.14s]  Hooray. Which is a pain.
[19405.14s -> 19407.64s]  But that's one down.
[19407.64s -> 19412.69s]  Uh, because
[19412.69s -> 19414.69s]  in the granite area,
[19414.69s -> 19416.69s]  I'm trying to remember,
[19416.69s -> 19418.69s]  like, no enemies are spawning
[19418.69s -> 19420.69s]  and this place sucks.
[19420.69s -> 19423.38s]  One of the golems drops
[19423.38s -> 19426.32s]  the, like, geode
[19426.32s -> 19428.32s]  clump or something.
[19428.32s -> 19431.27s]  And the geodes allow you
[19431.27s -> 19436.26s]  to make a pickaxe. But there's
[19436.26s -> 19438.26s]  no enemies here.
[19438.26s -> 19440.26s]  And I'm kind of pissed.
[19440.26s -> 19442.26s]  If I had a six,
[19442.26s -> 19444.26s]  if I had a clone,
[19444.26s -> 19446.26s]  if I had a tiny clone of star, would I torture it?
[19446.26s -> 19451.12s]  He wouldn't, he does.
[19451.12s -> 19455.60s]  You mean like a
[19455.60s -> 19457.60s]  doll, like a voodoo doll or something?
[19457.60s -> 19469.56s]  Uh, no.
[19469.56s -> 19480.56s]  No, I wouldn't. I'm just gonna keep going this way.
[19480.56s -> 19483.51s]  Drop it in the lava.
[19483.51s -> 19494.96s]  I'm not gonna use
[19494.96s -> 19496.96s]  a voodoo doll on somebody.
[19496.96s -> 19501.96s]  If anything, I would, like, have a voodoo doll
[19501.96s -> 19503.96s]  of somebody and, like,
[19503.96s -> 19505.96s]  cook bacon around it.
[19505.96s -> 19508.71s]  So it would be like, hmm, what's that
[19508.71s -> 19516.07s]  bacon smell? I would put, like,
[19516.07s -> 19518.07s]  Money on its hands and shit.
[19518.07s -> 19526.90s]  I would light incense
[19526.90s -> 19528.90s]  and have, like, aromatherapy around it. So you just, like,
[19528.90s -> 19533.32s]  felt better? That's not how it works.
[19533.32s -> 19535.32s]  I know it's not how it works.
[19535.32s -> 19537.32s]  Alright, Yerma! Yerma! Yerma! Yerma!
[19537.32s -> 19539.32s]  Yes?
[19539.32s -> 19541.32s]  It's a back to town. I'm getting
[19541.32s -> 19543.49s]  areolite ore.
[19543.49s -> 19545.49s]  That's more important. No one cares.
[19545.49s -> 19549.27s]  You just wanna skip everything.
[19549.27s -> 19553.24s]  I'm gonna drown.
[19553.24s -> 19555.24s]  Don't fucking drown! Holy shit, that was lucky.
[19555.24s -> 19558.74s]  Alright, back to town.
[19558.74s -> 19567.92s]  back to town all right for what uh we need to oh shit it's daytime we need to beat mechanical bosses
[19567.92s -> 19576.52s]  okay uh we need the myth round for mechanical bosses this part of the game is so annoying
[19577.84s -> 19586.74s]  what feels like to upgrade to your next pickaxe the things you need to do are so specific too hard
[19588.76s -> 19609.44s]  like i meow thrower i kind of want to play with the meow thrower might be fun let me see what else

[19638.52s -> 19648.29s]  the psycho amulet boost rogue and range damage in critical strike chance by five percent grants a
[19648.29s -> 19662.00s]  massive boost to these stats if you aren't moving does that count for my summons it does not
[19664.12s -> 19671.24s]  well what about you star what about me do you want the psychotic amulet what does it do

[20245.76s -> 20251.04s]  that draiden failed to rectify in time i see that you have awakened that is old toy that is mod added
[20251.04s -> 20256.08s]  lore okay it's the most pointless thing you could be reading i didn't know if it was like a material
[20256.16s -> 20271.08s]  or something or like a boss thing or lore i think i deposited my other one of these
[20273.68s -> 20278.64s]  ah shit we need souls of night you don't have those by chance do you souls of night hold on
[20278.64s -> 20285.57s]  i actually like deposited what is it what was that thing called no i did it again
[20285.57s -> 20287.89s]  fucking god damn it i was just trying to go over here
[20294.04s -> 20304.00s]  what the hell is this thing called again sort by name sort by id what are those boss soul things
[20304.00s -> 20309.89s]  called what a soul of fright is what he dropped that's not what we need
[20331.30s -> 20346.61s]  either way we need a mithril anvil oh this part's annoying didn't have another one that was more
[20346.61s -> 20360.98s]  item range i forget what it was called thanks bunny duck my foot hurts a lot sorry to hear that
[20361.54s -> 20382.39s]  oh yeah yeah oh wait i have the pickaxe shake it out a little gel all right oh there's a goodie
[20382.39s -> 20415.04s]  bag in here vampire did you get vampire mask vampire pants why is everybody freaking out in
[20415.04s -> 20423.89s]  here everyone's like what what what's going on what nothing's going on no no something like
[20423.89s -> 20435.67s]  something major is going on what are you talking about something what something something what
[20435.67s -> 20440.71s]  somebody was streaming that's what you sound like something something what that's what you sound like
[20440.71s -> 20445.92s]  apparently somebody was like in the top of just chatting streaming porn
[20447.25s -> 20456.34s]  oh actually someone was saying that in my chat nice how many people it had 20 000 viewers
[20458.00s -> 20467.04s]  why did it take an hour to put that down what i don't know it's late on the west coast i guess
[20467.76s -> 20475.41s]  it's not that late it's like not even 10 o'clock i mean it's not like i don't know if they have like
[20475.41s -> 20479.89s]  24 hour moderators on every single channel just to make sure someone doesn't do something wrong
[20479.97s -> 20485.25s]  no but did you hear how many people were there yeah but they're historically very slow at these
[20485.25s -> 20494.45s]  things and very inconsistent in their moderation so i'm not surprised i guess is what i'm getting
[20494.45s -> 20498.13s]  at it's like yeah that sucks but i'm not surprised i mean it's just kind of bizarre
[20503.00s -> 20510.53s]  we need to make sure it's really hard is this something we want i got to check with my supervisor
[20511.25s -> 20524.29s]  are we doing porn now 20 000 people there that's that's fucking insane all right um so what's next
[20525.09s -> 20529.89s]  by the way what uh what's your what's your like time frame here how you doing uh i don't want to
[20529.89s -> 20537.91s]  go much longer i've i've been a good sleep schedule boy yes um is it as midnight for you i'd like to
[20537.91s -> 20542.55s]  go a little oh yeah i'd like to go a little bit longer just so i can get this pickaxe thing out
[20542.55s -> 20551.51s]  of the way yeah so that the path is clear when we next start so what i'm doing is i got a gel
[20551.51s -> 20559.44s]  pickaxe so that i can mine one of the new ores and get you a pickaxe and then we can mine the
[20559.44s -> 20567.12s]  other ores and have a good old mine fest mine now i can get palladium then i can make a palladium
[20567.12s -> 20571.36s]  pickaxe and then we can start making a mithral anvil and that kind of stuff actually maybe now
[20571.36s -> 20581.09s]  is like a decent spot to stop is it yeah it's kind of like the uh the true start to uh the hard
[20581.09s -> 20586.77s]  mode okay because we haven't even gotten a single ore yet we only did one mechanical box it's been
[20586.77s -> 20593.49s]  six hours it's been we've played for a while yeah time flies when you tararia yeah it kind of
[20593.49s -> 20603.44s]  it was five hours before i looked at the clock it was really fun though it's all right how much
[20603.44s -> 20608.88s]  more like okay percentage wise like how much more is there left to do that's reasonable to do
[20608.88s -> 20613.92s]  not like oh i want to beat the last boss that has five trillion hp and i need every item in the game
[20617.00s -> 20624.80s]  of the normal terraria game it's these three new ores gearing up whatever you want to get then you
[20624.80s -> 20632.80s]  fight uh plantera isn't a big boss and golem is done pretty quickly after that then i'm pretty
[20632.80s -> 20637.76s]  sure right after golem you've got cultist then you have the lunar pillars and then you have
[20638.96s -> 20643.28s]  the moon lord which is the classic final finish and then calamity has a bunch of
[20643.28s -> 20650.66s]  shit after that and thorium has one boss after that so like even if we didn't do the super
[20650.66s -> 20656.98s]  late game calamity stuff i'd say we're at most halfway through but probably less than halfway
[20658.76s -> 20663.16s]  i mean i'll i'll finish it i'll like at least get to the end of like the actual game
[20664.04s -> 20667.44s]  do it again yeah getting to the end of calamity is a little bit
[20668.32s -> 20672.72s]  but like some of the late game calamity stuff just gets so obnoxious to craft and the amount of stuff
[20672.72s -> 20678.40s]  you have to keep track of is like not actually fun anymore for me i don't know i mean that's
[20678.40s -> 20683.28s]  that would be something i would want to do like on my own time i think yeah but uh actually there's
[20685.28s -> 20689.92s]  very easily another stream we wouldn't be done yeah i don't think unless we like really rushed
[20689.92s -> 20696.96s]  it and i don't think we're gonna do that yeah well see you hey see you next week for uh terraria
[20697.92s -> 20706.31s]  are these things quacking terraria episode three episode three actually well we would have done
[20706.31s -> 20710.79s]  this this would have been episode let's see six hours we did how long was the last week's stream
[20710.79s -> 20715.91s]  like six oh you're doing in like actual episode well because it would be a youtube episode each
[20715.91s -> 20721.19s]  episode would be about 10 to 15 minutes all right we'll say 20 no way more than a longer game you
[20721.19s -> 20725.27s]  do 20 because then you 20 i don't know you can get two ads in it you can get the mid roll
[20725.27s -> 20733.49s]  uh-huh okay so two four that's three episodes an hour three four six three three six nine
[20733.49s -> 20745.33s]  12 15 18 so we're we're like episode like 37 of terraria right now yeah so tune in next week
[20745.89s -> 20756.29s]  next week for episode 37 yeah yeah well go get some sleep okay i'm hungry too i think that yeah
[20756.29s -> 20762.05s]  that's a probably a good place to call we're just under six hours yep yep yep yep maybe if you
[20762.05s -> 20771.17s]  didn't start so late start so late let's start at like five p.m it was like it was like three
[20771.17s -> 20776.61s]  o'clock when i talked to you five for me yeah well i mean i i wait hold on i specifically
[20776.61s -> 20782.45s]  asked you like yesterday when you wanted to start and you were like it doesn't matter just hit me up
[20782.45s -> 20786.05s]  and i was like i usually start around three or four and you're like yeah that's fine i was being
[20786.05s -> 20789.81s]  polite like i was judging you the whole time but why didn't you say like hey can we start like at
[20789.81s -> 20795.57s]  like one or two i would have been like all right i i asked you like twice i was i'm just messing
[20798.05s -> 20803.33s]  why are you doing our stream is like six hours longer than your usual one so we're good um you
[20803.33s -> 20807.17s]  haven't been paying very much attention my average stream time is like seven to eight hours now
[20808.05s -> 20812.53s]  is it it's like six to eight hours yeah i don't even believe you you don't even pay attention
[20812.53s -> 20816.77s]  anymore oh my god like you pay attention to me i do
[20829.25s -> 20834.45s]  yeah i think 90 percent of the streams i do at least in the last like six months have been at
[20834.45s -> 20842.18s]  least six hours sometimes they're a little shorter but sometimes they also go like 11 to 12 hours too
[20842.98s -> 20850.40s]  did he leave him or am i still no no no i i i muted for like one second now you do not go for
[20850.40s -> 20855.86s]  11 hours i went for almost 13 hours at one time okay hold on hold on hold on hold up
[20858.13s -> 20861.25s]  oh are you gonna no no no do it are you gonna like go to like my like twitch stats or something
[20861.25s -> 20864.93s]  and find out what everybody doesn't know this but if you actually check a streamer's videos section
[20864.93s -> 20870.85s]  you can see what games they play when they play yeah oh my god i hear myself fuck no so go go
[20870.85s -> 20874.69s]  go to my my pods and go look and tell me what the stream times are i'm looking because
[20875.73s -> 20883.57s]  i'm i'm both surprised and like truly impressed that you can last at your age and at your health
[20883.57s -> 20893.62s]  for seven hours i'm i'm as healthy as a goddamn ox all right no that's good i remember the good
[20893.62s -> 20900.34s]  old days of uh you know germa two three times a week if you're lucky of three hour streams
[20901.06s -> 20908.16s]  yeah but i was still it takes a lot to get used to transitioning from editing down like a seven
[20908.16s -> 20915.92s]  minute video no like i never used to do it i didn't do i didn't do anything
[20917.27s -> 20923.52s]  so when you when you make like videos like a 10 minute video one day like anyone hey it's
[20923.52s -> 20929.67s]  somebody just mentioned this yeah i used to stream once every four or five months so i think we've
[20929.75s -> 20935.11s]  evolved well no you're like your first like i'm gonna be streaming video was like i'm gonna be
[20935.11s -> 20941.75s]  streaming at least two or three times a week no that i did they were only like three four hours
[20941.75s -> 20951.67s]  long that's what i mean it's like you did like hey i'm not i'm not sure how much you know this
[20951.67s -> 20956.15s]  but do you know that most people on twitch do not stream for more than like four or five hours at
[20956.15s -> 20960.47s]  a time did you know that like that's like nobody streams for like more than six to eight hours
[20961.11s -> 20967.52s]  a ton of people only stream for like three or four hours did you know that i don't i mean a lot of
[20967.52s -> 20973.28s]  people do but i don't know if i'd go like a ton like not streaming is the twitch meta i'm telling
[20973.28s -> 20986.10s]  you calls out the entire platform no i but what that's not calling anybody out that's saying like
[20986.10s -> 20994.58s]  that most but they also they also stream more days you understand well a lot of people that like oh
[20994.58s -> 21009.51s]  like kim the tat man streams like four hours but he does it twice a day it's a lot i think you're
[21009.51s -> 21015.27s]  just trying to i'm trying to downplay no no i'm telling you twitch streamers because you think
[21015.27s -> 21021.27s]  you're better than them now but it's just like oh i got it i'm playing a clam he can talk he can

[22104.88s -> 22106.40s]  like shopping and restaurants and stuff
[22112.61s -> 22119.59s]  there's a lot of interesting stuff restaurant restaurants uh there are so many restaurants
[22119.59s -> 22129.96s]  in boston it's like it's hard to even tell you to go to one but i would definitely say museum of
[22129.96s -> 22135.40s]  science if you have like young siblings or cousins or something that you're with uh children's museum
[22136.36s -> 22145.78s]  then uh faneuil hall i'd say that's probably let me check out like you check out you know um like fenway
[22145.78s -> 22150.42s]  fenway is awesome too if you can get in the you like baseball even just being around fenway it's
[22150.42s -> 22154.50s]  like right in there so you got plenty of opportunities to kind of be part of the scene
[22155.30s -> 22161.76s]  it's pretty good i i i wouldn't recommend the duck boats i don't think that's kind of i would
[22161.76s -> 22172.56s]  i don't know if i would recommend somebody to do that there's nothing wrong with the duck boats
[22172.56s -> 22181.92s]  but the duck boats really is a kind of i'm out of town guy in a hawaiian shirt with the kind of
[22182.96s -> 22189.24s]  sunscreen all over his nose and glasses around his neck kind of thing to do you know what i'm
[22189.24s -> 22197.22s]  saying it's a very like touristy thing to do i don't know if it's you just kind of float around
[22197.22s -> 22202.58s]  and drive around and they if you really really want to do something insanely touristy
[22203.14s -> 22215.44s]  uh boston has a pretty famous duck boats but if you if you're into that then absolutely do it
[22216.32s -> 22224.10s]  it is a subterranean vehicle it goes on the ground and then goes underground well no you don't like
[22224.10s -> 22229.06s]  it just it floats it's a boat it's a boat it's a car boat that drives around and you float you don't

[22384.26s -> 22393.60s]  defend self he's come a long way yeah all right this is what i what i was trying to say before
[22395.20s -> 22401.12s]  he look he opened up my past streaming schedule shit and he was like oh all right hold on i was
[22401.12s -> 22409.24s]  wrong here going from making a video that is seven to eight minutes and not having to be live in
[22409.24s -> 22415.57s]  front of people for more than you know i didn't really do it that often you like kind of build
[22415.57s -> 22423.57s]  up your comfort level to do it and i'm not gonna lie two years ago three years ago it was a
[22423.57s -> 22428.37s]  difference it was it's a lot different it was a big change to hey instead of sitting here and
[22428.37s -> 22433.49s]  like playing a game and trying to do like funny weird interesting things and in dark souls and
[22433.49s -> 22438.69s]  you're not even getting out of the tutorial room for two or three hours it was hey i'm gonna be
[22438.69s -> 22445.56s]  here and these people gonna be here there's no use nobody used to be in the room you know like
[22445.56s -> 22454.44s]  nobody is in the room now but it was just me and transitioning from it's just me to there
[22454.44s -> 22459.88s]  might be thousands of people here you need to kind of build up like a stamina to be able to
[22460.52s -> 22467.56s]  oh it's been an hour or two okay um i think i'm done it's been three hours uh yeah that's uh
[22467.88s -> 22492.68s]  bye nobody to yell that the joke you just said sucked yeah that's yeah like you know what i mean
[22492.68s -> 22499.62s]  it's like different it's a different beast i could say something stupid and then put it in a youtube
[22499.62s -> 22503.86s]  video and not know if people thought it was funny until like potentially a week later
[22505.92s -> 22519.62s]  i get instant feedback now so yeah and now i can stream for six seven eight hours at a time and
[22519.62s -> 22546.68s]  it's fine never it didn't use to be the case though instant conflict yeah but yeah that's
[22547.64s -> 22555.75s]  that's 50 bucks from phylactery thank you and then finally here tingy can we make it official
[22555.75s -> 22564.79s]  and call these weekly streams sterarius saturdays no yeah i i've come to the decision and realization
[22564.79s -> 22572.07s]  that you cannot name anything a day of the week ever again because oh it's scare saturdays it's
[22572.07s -> 22577.68s]  terraria saturdays what if we can't do it on saturday oh shit we have to do it on saturday now
[22578.98s -> 22582.90s]  there has to be a scare saturdays on saturday instead of just being just do it when you can
[22584.10s -> 22592.69s]  you know what if we do a terraria on friday it's like oh shit man time to rebrand everything
[22593.49s -> 22611.62s]  so i'm against naming days of the week in a title stop scare saturdays because you're a coward
[22611.62s -> 22618.48s]  yeah i don't know fine say it but i also ran out of like kind of scary games to play for a little
[22618.48s -> 22625.60s]  while but scary games suck they're really fucking stressful and i'll tell you i'm not going to
[22625.60s -> 22631.20s]  bullshit you it got to a point where it would be like thursday night and i would know i was
[22631.20s -> 22634.80s]  going to record something for saturday or like friday night or even even on saturday afternoon
[22635.44s -> 22639.68s]  and i'd be like fuck man i don't i don't want to play scary game right now fuck it's going to
[22639.68s -> 22641.36s]  scare me i'm gonna get like stressed out and
[22648.39s -> 22661.84s]  it you're gonna have to make yourself want to do it in a way jump scares and all that yeah
[22664.02s -> 22672.80s]  vr horror games are a blast to watch you play i had to have lost at least a few years of my life
[22674.96s -> 22677.44s]  there was at least two or three parts of that game that would just
[22678.32s -> 22685.92s]  it was such a jump in such a scary scenario that it my like i definitely took at least like
[22685.92s -> 22690.48s]  three years of blood pumping capability away from my heart like at the end of my life
[22691.60s -> 22702.16s]  unless i'm a super high strong neurotic kind of person anyways so you add in terrifying jump
[22702.16s -> 22717.19s]  scares just dials it up to a thousand but let's uh get the credits on here these are all the subs
