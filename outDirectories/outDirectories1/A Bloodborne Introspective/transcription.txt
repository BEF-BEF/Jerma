[6.01s -> 12.17s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with some Bloodborne gameplay and commentary.
[12.17s -> 17.14s]  I was gonna talk about Bloodborne, this video is gonna be about Bloodborne, and more specifically,
[17.14s -> 23.21s]  how I feel towards these games now from- from software, which is always an impossible
[23.21s -> 28.92s]  company's name to say when you're trying to describe something that they made. I'm a fan now,
[28.92s -> 34.44s]  and I never was. Uh, this is a chat list dungeon, by the way. If you don't know what these are,
[34.44s -> 38.60s]  these are randomized dungeons that are in the game. You collect a certain amount of resources,
[38.60s -> 42.68s]  and you consume them, and you can make dungeons, you can save their seeds and share them with
[42.68s -> 46.84s]  people, and it's pretty interesting. It's a cool mechanic. It allows you to continue playing the
[46.84s -> 51.32s]  game once you're done, rather than continue the cycle of new game plus new game plus new
[51.32s -> 57.08s]  game plus like you used to do in the Dark Souls games. But I finished it. I finished Bloodborne,
[57.08s -> 60.68s]  and that's what we're going to talk about. I completed the game besides the chalice dungeons
[60.68s -> 67.67s]  I still have, and that's something I haven't done in an extremely long time. Single-player games,
[67.67s -> 73.03s]  for me, I don't really play them that often, and when I do, I play them for a couple hours maybe,
[73.03s -> 77.35s]  and I give up on them. I can't tell you how many times I've tried to start Fallout. I've never done
[77.35s -> 81.27s]  that, never completed Fallout. I haven't even gotten past like the character creator in Fallout.
[81.27s -> 86.07s]  I know. I- fuck me, right? And I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I know. I just have such trouble
[86.63s -> 90.23s]  playing these games and loading them up and staying in them and staying interested in them.
[90.23s -> 96.17s]  The last time I beat a single-player game before Shadow of Mordor, because I really like Shadow of
[96.17s -> 104.31s]  Mordor, before that, though, you're talking about maybe GTA V back in 2013. Or, I mean, I don't
[104.31s -> 109.19s]  really count Binding of Isaac, because Binding of Isaac is very condensed. You can technically
[109.19s -> 115.19s]  beat Binding of Isaac in 30 minutes, right? I'm talking about start to finish storyline game
[115.19s -> 120.79s]  that's only designed pretty much for you to play by yourself. And yes, Bloodborne does have co-op,
[120.79s -> 126.31s]  and it does have PvP, but I feel like the game, the core game, was designed for you to experience
[126.31s -> 133.24s]  at least most of it alone. And we'll transition from this to talk about the game, Bloodborne,
[133.24s -> 138.92s]  and the Dark Souls games and how I feel about those two and how, you know, I've never beaten
[138.92s -> 144.04s]  Dark Souls or Dark Souls 2. I gave up on them because I thought they were too much. I thought
[144.04s -> 150.28s]  they were too hard, and I thought they were way over my head in regards to everything that was
[150.28s -> 156.33s]  in the game. I didn't get it. I just did not get it. And now, after playing Bloodborne,
[156.89s -> 160.97s]  I finally started to get it. I started to understand why these games were interesting
[160.97s -> 165.13s]  and why they were cool, why they were fun. It was the unknown that was the more interesting thing,
[165.13s -> 169.61s]  rather than having somebody point you in the right direction. And I loved it. I got so into
[169.61s -> 174.17s]  Bloodborne, so into the storyline, it made me want to go back and play Dark Souls 2,
[174.17s -> 179.99s]  because holy shit, I love Bloodborne so much, I'm gonna love Dark Souls. That wasn't necessarily
[179.99s -> 186.79s]  the case, because I did go back and play Dark Souls 2, and it was a disaster. I was getting
[186.79s -> 191.43s]  hit by every enemy. I was walking off cliffs. I was falling to my death. I was getting killed
[191.43s -> 196.79s]  over and over again, and I said, I can't fucking do this. Screw this. I am turning this off,
[196.79s -> 203.00s]  and I'm not doing it again. Wait a second. Wait a second. That is exactly what I had to do when
[203.00s -> 207.88s]  I played Bloodborne. When I loaded up Bloodborne for the first time, I had to memorize enemies.
[207.88s -> 214.04s]  I died over and over again at the first two or three stages of Bloodborne. It took me hours
[214.04s -> 220.44s]  to understand where to go and why I was going there in the first place. So why then is it so
[220.44s -> 227.11s]  hard for me to play Dark Souls when I understand, I get it, I know why I like these games? And the
[227.11s -> 232.33s]  answer is pretty simple. If you and I were sitting on a couch right now, and on the screen was Super
[232.33s -> 237.61s]  Mario Brothers, it doesn't matter what level I'd be on. It doesn't matter what world I'd be in.
[237.61s -> 244.31s]  If I handed you that controller, you would know exactly where to go and exactly what to do. You
[244.31s -> 249.16s]  could not even, even if you weren't even in the room, you could be stumbling into the house with
[249.16s -> 253.32s]  a bunch of grocery bags in your arms and be like, holy, what are you playing Mario? Let me sit down.
[253.32s -> 257.40s]  Oh, let me check this out. And with one hand, pick it up with like holding your chin down
[257.40s -> 262.97s]  on the grocery bag and you'd probably be able to beat the level or at least know what to do to a
[262.97s -> 268.09s]  point where it would only take you a few tries to get close to beating it. You know what I mean?
[268.65s -> 275.42s]  Replace that with Bloodborne. Same exact scenario. I just give you the controller in a random part
[275.42s -> 282.25s]  of Bloodborne or a random part of Dark Souls. If you've never seen that before, the chances are
[282.25s -> 287.77s]  very high that you're just going to walk up the stairs and die, or you're going to get far enough
[287.77s -> 291.21s]  but not know where to go. And then you're going to look at me and you're going to go, hey, what am
[291.21s -> 296.22s]  I supposed to do here? Do I open this door? This door is locked. I can't go in here. And then I'm
[296.22s -> 304.62s]  going to say, uh, you know, I have like 70 hours in Bloodborne. I fucking don't remember if that's
[304.62s -> 313.02s]  the door that you get the key and hold on. Let me open the Wiki page because this is really confusing
[313.02s -> 319.26s]  the shit out of me. The open-endedness of Bloodborne and Dark Souls and just the sheer amount of stuff
[319.26s -> 324.94s]  that's so cryptic that you need to almost figure out as a community to even know what the item does
[325.58s -> 330.62s]  is something that I've never really experienced before. And that's going back to the why I haven't
[330.62s -> 334.34s]  played Dark Souls and why I haven't really gotten into it and how I didn't really like it.
[334.34s -> 340.02s]  You have to relearn it all again. There is no universal just sit down and play it because
[340.02s -> 344.82s]  everything is so open-ended and there's so much information in each one of these games
[344.82s -> 349.59s]  that it's daunting. And it's something that I have to get over because I really do, like I said,
[349.59s -> 353.67s]  I do want to go back and I want to beat Dark Souls, I want to beat Dark Souls 2, but I have
[353.67s -> 359.99s]  to take my brain out of the, this is Bloodborne, I know Bloodborne. It's like, yeah, there's a
[359.99s -> 365.19s]  million similarities to these games from game to game, but you have to just learn it. You have
[365.19s -> 370.15s]  to just let the experience happen for you and know what you're getting into before you start it.
[370.15s -> 374.98s]  So that wraps up this video. Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it
[374.98s -> 380.10s]  and I'll see you guys all next time. Probably gonna play some new game plus in Bloodborne,
[380.10s -> 385.05s]  although I do want to make a new character at some point. I don't know, I might just give up
[385.05s -> 390.09s]  on it entirely and try to beat Dark Souls or Dark Souls 2. I don't know, but we'll cross
[390.09s -> 394.50s]  that bridge when I crush it. We'll cross that bridge when I crush it. Thanks, everybody.
[394.50s -> 397.30s]  Take it easy. Have a good day and goodbye.
