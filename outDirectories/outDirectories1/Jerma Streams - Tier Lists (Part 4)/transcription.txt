[1.85s -> 15.86s]  Alright, let me get, I need to have my Chrome. Google Chrome. Look at that. Um, give me one second.
[25.46s -> 32.50s]  Turn on cam, turn on cam, turn on cam, turn on cam. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[33.30s -> 39.93s]  I have to change to just chatting too. Where the heck? And I gotta have music too. I can't just
[39.93s -> 46.62s]  sit here silent. We need like a music. I'll turn the camera on, but it's not right. I need music.
[50.44s -> 57.83s]  Face cam, please. I'm going to put it on. I'm very sweaty though. Okay. Let's do this condiments and
[57.83s -> 72.14s]  sauces. Okay. And then world of Warcraft expansions. This one's going to be really fun. I can't wait to
[72.14s -> 80.47s]  do this one. What's this? This is YouTube link. Why did I just click? I'm not, why did I just click
[80.47s -> 91.88s]  that? That's why would I click the first link in chat? Am I insane? I'm not playing Joel's
[93.08s -> 97.88s]  3d movie maker movie for background noise. I want to watch it on the video stream.
[100.01s -> 115.18s]  It's not, that's not music. What's this? This is the same one. I'm just going to put on my own.
[115.18s -> 122.18s]  Okay. We, how about, uh, no, I'm not watching it. No, we're going to watch it during the
[122.18s -> 132.57s]  watch movies stream. Cause that's a, that's a movie. It'll be in between two public domain
[133.29s -> 155.67s]  movies. All right. What do I want to listen to? How about let's go back to here. Oh no. It's,
[155.67s -> 177.42s]  oh shit. My shit's broken. Can I do this? Let's get that window, window capture.
[186.60s -> 193.38s]  Oh no, Jeremy, your stream. It's all right. It'll be fine. Don't worry. Everybody relax.
[194.10s -> 214.54s]  Condiments and tier lists. Let's shrink this, shrink that so we can see it better.
[215.18s -> 237.70s]  I'll put my camera up here. I look wicked ugly. No, I don't look pretty handsome. Okay.
[238.26s -> 243.35s]  Let's take a look. How do I look right now? I think I've ever had like some stains on my shirt,
[243.35s -> 253.00s]  but what am I going to do? Can you see me? Why is the camera so big? Oh right. I was doing that.
[253.00s -> 270.36s]  Thank you. Look at how big. Oh, hi guys. I know I'm not a single and there we go. Wait, let me
[270.36s -> 291.29s]  apply. No, who cares? All right. So let's go. Jeremy lied about wicked ugly. Uh, I'm going to say,
[294.15s -> 299.64s]  first of all, let's add actually, no, this is just D is just D already off the bat. I, well,
[299.64s -> 310.60s]  I'm not even in just chatting. How do I change that? Hold on. Can I first close this? What the
[310.60s -> 327.75s]  fuck am I doing? Just chatting. Just how about just tears? I mean, that's what we're doing.
[328.39s -> 342.15s]  That looks good. Tears. We're in the right category. I got to get a haircut too. Thanks
[342.15s -> 353.16s]  for reminding me. All right. So we've got sriracha. I hate it. Honey. Let's put a honey and B for now.
[353.72s -> 362.52s]  I didn't even put on any music either. It'll come later. Mayonnaise. But the thing is about
[363.16s -> 367.48s]  mayonnaise. I don't, I don't eat. I don't put it on everything. I only put it on some stuff.
[368.04s -> 382.42s]  This just hurts. I did it when something hurts to eat it. I don't want it. This is mayonnaise,
[382.42s -> 386.98s]  right? Okay. Ranch. I think ranch is overrated, but I still like it.
[393.53s -> 401.99s]  I've not made my decision. Honey is in B. I hold on. I'm just getting, I'm just getting it up here.
[401.99s -> 408.86s]  I'm not ready yet. Hummus is somewhere between A and S. It's I lived off that stuff in college.
[411.69s -> 423.94s]  Tomato, like pizza sauce. Why is there like tomato sauce? It's like spaghetti. This is pesto.
[424.66s -> 434.68s]  It's okay. This is Dijon mustard. I'm just getting it up there. This is barbecue sauce.
[436.76s -> 444.73s]  Hold on. Just to keep it, keep it in B. Tartar sauce. B. Frank's Red Hot is the worst condiment
[444.73s -> 454.17s]  in the world. It is absolutely fucking revolting. It does not know what it wants to be.
[455.05s -> 461.53s]  It so desperately wants to be a hot sauce, but it just tastes like buttery, gross liquid. It's
[462.73s -> 473.05s]  like that hot flavor, right? No, it's awful. It's hot sauce that's not hot. It's just like
[473.05s -> 479.90s]  the buffalo flavor. That's the worst one in the whole list. So I would eat Sriracha five
[479.90s -> 493.16s]  times before I had Frank's once. Regular default, yellow mustard. I like Dijon better.
[493.96s -> 498.68s]  Thousand Island is all right. Ketchup is good, but I'm going to have a lot of B's.
[500.81s -> 508.76s]  Jack Daniel's. Just Jack Daniel's barbecue sauce or like just drinking Jack Daniel's?
[509.48s -> 516.89s]  Honey mustard, that goes up here. This is guacamole. Guacamole, it really depends on what
[516.89s -> 521.93s]  kind of guacamole and who made it because guacamole can be down here or guacamole can be up here.
[522.73s -> 532.14s]  So I'm going to take the average and I'm going to say somewhere around here, like here. Okay, now
[533.48s -> 543.35s]  salsa is S. I eat salsa all the fucking time. I love salsa. It's, yeah. Salsa is one of the
[543.35s -> 547.35s]  only things you could just eat every day and probably not care and not get sick of it.
[550.41s -> 561.83s]  That and this is a Cholula. Cholula is good. Cholula is better than Sriracha. In my opinion,
[561.83s -> 571.72s]  rather have to say that is better than guacamole. This is not even done. This is not even correct.
[571.72s -> 582.33s]  This is not accurate. Maple syrup. What is this? Relish. And then this is Worcestershire sauce.
[584.82s -> 588.26s]  I don't put it on anything. All right. Let me, okay. I need music.
[589.37s -> 598.54s]  Give me music. Turn that camera off first. You marinate. Yeah, but it's on a, is that condiment?
[602.82s -> 611.37s]  Oh, it's soy sauce. Right. Okay. If it's soy sauce, I don't like it. I actually really don't like soy
[611.37s -> 615.21s]  sauce at all. I'm sorry. I know people are getting mad about that. It's not that far down though.
[615.21s -> 622.09s]  It's, I would rather have soy sauce than like Jack Daniel's fucking garbage can barbecue sauce.
[625.38s -> 644.89s]  All right. I need music. Just chill music. Chill out music. I did click on the first one, which
[644.89s -> 660.55s]  means, is this point your camera out the window airplane vlog? I don't know. Is it? This is like
[660.55s -> 676.98s]  a regular song. Chill step. There's something called chill step. What is that genre? I like
[676.98s -> 691.26s]  this. This is fine. This can stay. Come back. So let me, let me narrow this down. Honey should be
[691.26s -> 698.79s]  up here. Pesto is good for three bites. And then you start, it's just be, you hate it. Seriously,
[698.79s -> 702.07s]  like the first two or three bites of something with pesto on it, you go, holy shit, that's
[702.07s -> 705.59s]  fucking incredible. And then after that, you do like, I don't want to eat this anymore.
[705.59s -> 723.75s]  I would definitely rather have tomato sauce on something than ranch. I would never eat this.
[726.38s -> 738.28s]  No, they would never, I would never eat that ever. Pesto is a condiment for an obese college student.
[740.15s -> 749.61s]  What? Hold on. I got to fix my like Lego hair. It's a little better. Tartar sauce is not better
[749.61s -> 766.78s]  than barbecue sauce. It's good. It's close. It's really close. I'm trying to figure out this is
[766.78s -> 774.90s]  S or A. They both S. Would I rather like, no, sausage is S. Sausage complete S.
[776.74s -> 784.82s]  Honey is better than Thomas. I have a rule that I cannot have more than two or three S's. So it,
[784.82s -> 803.64s]  otherwise, like what the hell do you think you're doing? Oh, I would put, I would use it. I would
[803.64s -> 815.56s]  use both of them. Ketchup is better than mustard. I'm talking regular, just yellow mustard. I think
[815.56s -> 832.79s]  I'm good. I think this is it. No, it's not true. I'm done. Why is soy so low? I just, I don't know.
[832.79s -> 844.52s]  I don't like it. It just tastes, it just tastes like salty, dirty water to me. I know. Everybody
[844.52s -> 852.23s]  hates me now. I know. But I, but look, it's not, I, this is, I would still eat it. I would still
[852.23s -> 855.99s]  like it. I wouldn't mind it if it was like part of something, if it was on something already,
[856.71s -> 862.79s]  but adding soy sauce is just like salt water. It's just like, it's like taking a, you're dipping
[862.79s -> 869.59s]  a cup in the ocean and like sipping the cup. It's just like salt bomb. If it's on something and I,
[869.59s -> 875.80s]  dipping like sushi in it, that's pretty good. But honey is gross. Well, we have different opinions
[875.80s -> 885.93s]  and I'm so happy about that. Hey, I like soy sauce more than I like relish. In fact, that's not fair
[885.93s -> 895.70s]  because I would rather have this than, now it's ready. I'd rather have Cholula than soy sauce.
[895.70s -> 900.18s]  I'd rather have tomato sauce than soy sauce. I'd rather have guacamole than soy sauce. I'd rather
[900.18s -> 907.27s]  have, this is not true. That's completely untrue. I actually would not, I would rather have soy
[907.27s -> 925.72s]  sauce than pesto. No, I wouldn't. Guacamole, no. Okay. I'm done. Uh, Joel just, Joel just rated me.
[926.36s -> 935.40s]  What's up, Joel? Your movie was fucking sick. I saw your movie. It was fucking sick.
[940.38s -> 947.56s]  My favorite part is when, I mean, he did, liar, liar. What? Don't, don't mess around like that.
[948.12s -> 956.30s]  Joel, what do you think of my list and those viewers that came from, Joel, what do you think
[956.30s -> 966.97s]  of this list? People, Joel, mayonnaise, right? It's an English thing. Joel's not from England.
[967.85s -> 984.12s]  Don't even, why I said that? Um, not even close. Same, same like continent. Okay. Um, I'm, it's
[984.12s -> 996.12s]  an English, that's a, that's a European thing. That's what I was told. I was, I told the fries in,
[996.12s -> 1006.39s]  in, I almost said oregano. Fries and mayonnaise is an, is a European thing. Joel, please quantify
[1006.39s -> 1020.17s]  this. Mayo on fries is definitely a European thing. Joel, do you do this? Joel, I'm not going
[1020.17s -> 1046.17s]  to move on until you answer me. You're not even here. I got long ass fingernails. Uh, he's not
[1046.17s -> 1051.90s]  even here. He's not here. Oh, well, thanks for the, no, really, thanks for the host or the raid,
[1051.90s -> 1057.90s]  whatever it was. I hope you guys had a fun time. He did respond. Thank you, Dad, for the 10 community
[1057.90s -> 1060.86s]  subs. We got him, oh yeah, World of Warcraft expansions. Right, that's the other one.
[1061.58s -> 1069.59s]  Here we go. Ready? I'll do this with my eyes closed. I think I'm probably gonna get it right.
[1069.59s -> 1072.47s]  Let me just see where they are. Like, no, I didn't even have to look at it. I, okay.
[1073.59s -> 1079.64s]  World of Warcraft expansion tier list and just game tier list. I'm not even paying attention.
[1079.64s -> 1090.65s]  I don't even know what I'm looking at. Where, okay, where, where, where is, where are we?
[1091.21s -> 1115.21s]  Where's Burning Crusade? Where's Burning Crusade? Fast as lightning. The panda is in A? No, no, no,
[1115.21s -> 1122.74s]  no, it's not. Uh, this is where the game started to be bad. This is, I remember, I remember,
[1122.74s -> 1126.34s]  I remember loading up World of Warcraft during that expansion and playing for like six hours and
[1126.34s -> 1133.22s]  going, this is, this game's not fun anymore. That's where I started to stop playing. Then,
[1134.02s -> 1138.02s]  you're probably wondering, Jeremo, what the fuck is Legion doing? I think Legion was the best,
[1138.66s -> 1144.38s]  like, the best expansion that came out recently in the last, like, 10 years. How long, well,
[1144.38s -> 1149.48s]  this is two expansions ago, right? Legion brought me back to the game and I thought it was really,
[1149.48s -> 1154.68s]  really, really great. Not as good as that when you first played on classic. Wrath of the Lich King,
[1154.68s -> 1159.48s]  best expansion pack. I think that's not an unpopular opinion and Burning Crusade, very
[1159.48s -> 1168.18s]  classic. These were, these were, these were so awful, I'm gonna give them a mention. I'm
[1168.18s -> 1172.66s]  not even sure this is even the right one, but I know it's not one of these, so it's, it belongs
[1172.66s -> 1188.49s]  down here. All right, any more? Official TF2 maps. You want to do TF2 maps? Chex mix. I don't think
[1188.49s -> 1197.35s]  I can do the TF2 maps. It's been a long time. Why can I not? Computers are so bad. I can't even
[1197.35s -> 1203.72s]  right-click in the chat that's in Streamlabs OBS. Have I said anything good about Streamlabs OBS?
[1203.72s -> 1213.34s]  Why do I still use it? Is there a reason why I'm still using this? This is free. No, so I'm not
[1213.34s -> 1220.18s]  talking about it, right? Yeah, I guess. Uh, there's so many maps in TF2. This is gonna, I don't know
[1220.18s -> 1228.89s]  if I can, I might have to do, this is gonna be sloppy. Not using XSplit. I tried to use XSplit,
[1228.89s -> 1236.89s]  it's way worse. And you have to pay for XSplit. Remember, JetBlue is the only company I like.
[1237.45s -> 1254.04s]  All right, where was it? TF2 maps. Let me see it again. Foldmetal Alchemist characters. All right,
[1254.04s -> 1299.50s]  let's do Chex Mix. God damn it, give me a break. Uh, Chex Mix. Okay. Chex are gross. I dare,
[1299.50s -> 1311.08s]  they're not good. They're very, they're very bad. Now I'm done. This has to be like a generational
[1311.08s -> 1320.07s]  change thing. You ate around the Chex when I was younger. You didn't eat the Chex. It's like, just
[1322.33s -> 1328.14s]  do Foldmetal Alchemist. Why do you want me to do Foldmetal Alchemist? Call of Duty games? I've
[1328.14s -> 1335.98s]  played three of them. I can't do this one. Official TF2 maps. Well, why not? Let's do this one. This
[1335.98s -> 1348.47s]  sounds like interesting for a little bit. Oh my God. I'm kind of getting into the, into the weeds
[1348.47s -> 1360.89s]  here. Uh, are these five CP or? Okay. I don't, no opinion. I don't have any opinion. Manpower?
[1362.73s -> 1366.65s]  No, no, no, no. Thunder Mountain Manpower. What do you, what does this, what does that mean?
[1371.59s -> 1383.00s]  Tuber Town? Thunder Mountain Manpower. It's just Thunder Mountain. Okay.
[1384.42s -> 1394.70s]  I don't remember. Hydro? F. Doomsday? F. Snowplow? I actually kind of remember this being, okay.
[1396.07s -> 1410.22s]  Upward. Did I have more fun on Gorge or upward? That's accurate. Now I love Gorge. Attack Defend
[1410.22s -> 1415.98s]  Gorge is like the best map they've ever made. I love for Gorge. It's so much. Um, where's Dust
[1415.98s -> 1422.38s]  Bull? Yeah. Call me a loser. Call me like an idiot. That's fine. That's one of my favorite
[1422.38s -> 1425.66s]  maps. Original, original team for you. It doesn't even play TF Classic. You understand.
[1426.30s -> 1435.03s]  This is Team Fortress 2. I know. Badwater is up there, but it's okay. It's okay. Nightfall.
[1435.03s -> 1439.61s]  I don't, Banana Bay. Don't know. Two Ford Invasion. I played it like once or twice.
[1440.33s -> 1451.30s]  Barn Blitz. Get up there. It leads to B. It's an A. No, it's not. Probed. Frontier. Get up there.
[1452.18s -> 1458.81s]  Frontier is not better than Badwater. Yes, it is. It's better than Badwater. Better than Barn Blitz.
[1458.81s -> 1468.23s]  Um, Viaduct. This is not fair though because this is different game modes. Like I think Viaduct is
[1468.23s -> 1474.36s]  awesome, but I don't know if I would put Viaduct in the same category as like upward. You know what
[1474.36s -> 1480.12s]  I mean? They're like they're completely different game modes. That's just tricky. This is not
[1480.12s -> 1491.69s]  accurate. I'll keep doing it though. Um, I know a lot of people that play comp are going to hate my
[1491.69s -> 1502.81s]  guts, but I really don't like any of the comp maps. I really don't like them that much. I just don't.
[1503.61s -> 1521.14s]  Two Ford sucks, but it's fun just to snipe. Granary is not that low. I know, but Lakeside.
[1521.14s -> 1524.42s]  I love Lakeside, but not how much though. Not that much. I've never been to Brazil.
[1526.71s -> 1530.31s]  Snowy Coast. It's taken me a while to remember these though. Snakewater? No.
[1530.31s -> 1535.91s]  No. Wait, Snakewater was... No, that's Badlands.
[1536.79s -> 1547.18s]  Powerhouse? Well, no. I don't really... Where's the one that I really don't like?
[1547.98s -> 1561.02s]  It's Harvest. Yes, can you tell? I just played Harvest for like six hours straight. Like three
[1561.02s -> 1570.63s]  days a week. I just like... What do you... Oh, there's... There it is. Where... What does it do?
[1570.63s -> 1578.87s]  Tack Defend Gorge. There it is. Sawmill. Sawmill. Sawmill. Sawmill is good, but I don't know if I
[1578.87s -> 1591.62s]  would put sawmill up where Nucleus is. I really don't think so. Egypt. Awful. King of the Hill
[1591.62s -> 1601.88s]  Badlands. Do I remember playing this? Where is the... Where is the... Where is it? Not Junction.
[1602.84s -> 1606.44s]  It was one of the fairly newer ones when I... Right before I stopped playing.
[1607.24s -> 1615.26s]  Is this Payload Thunder Mountain? Yeah. Get this out of here. Manpower. What was it called?
[1616.06s -> 1623.91s]  Was it Borneo? I think it was Borneo. I really liked this one, if I'm remembering correctly.
[1625.30s -> 1629.38s]  This is the one where it... Where it turns the corner and there's always a sentry in the little
[1629.38s -> 1641.38s]  house? Yeah, this one's great. I was... I was that guy. I was the one doing the sentry in the little
[1641.38s -> 1655.30s]  house. It worked every time. What a great game. This game's so good. Why can... Why can nothing
[1655.30s -> 1667.77s]  ever replace this? No, I didn't really like the Sawmill map. I don't know what Watergate is.
[1667.77s -> 1672.17s]  I think these are Manver's Machine Maps. I can't... Don't know opinion on it, really.
[1674.68s -> 1684.39s]  Kong King was not very good. I really don't like Kong King. People are going to hate me for this
[1684.39s -> 1695.18s]  one. I actually really like Turbine. It's a mess. Well, I don't really like it. I like it enough.
[1696.14s -> 1708.76s]  Mercenary Park. Lazarus Pipeline. I remember Pipeline. What is the one that never ends?
[1709.80s -> 1719.86s]  What is Hightower? There it is. Okay. Hightower also comes up a little bit higher than Turbine,
[1719.86s -> 1732.49s]  for sure. New maps are good. Timbertown. Oh, I really hated Steel. I remember every time
[1732.49s -> 1736.17s]  it would change to Steel, I would instantly hit cancel. I'd spam, spam, spam, because the game,
[1736.97s -> 1741.05s]  when it was loading, you couldn't do anything. And I remember just trying desperately to make
[1741.05s -> 1746.01s]  sure I hit cancel so I could go back to the other, to the service screen. Every time.
[1748.18s -> 1762.90s]  Process was okay. I don't remember it enough, though. How could I forget this? I love Hoodoo.
[1762.90s -> 1771.62s]  Bypass. Manhattan. Degroud Key was... It's better than Steel, and it's better than... Yeah, it's not
[1771.62s -> 1775.94s]  like it's better than Kong King, though. Tsukimaki. Junction. Don't like it at all.
[1776.82s -> 1783.40s]  Better than Steel, though. And better than Degroud Key. Vanguard. I don't... Powerhouse,
[1783.40s -> 1791.11s]  I don't... I played it, but I don't... Not enough. What's the one with the two that cross in the
[1791.11s -> 1807.06s]  middle? The payload war. Is that Nightfall? That's Nightfall, right? Better than Granary. I had fun
[1807.06s -> 1814.39s]  on it. Same with Pipeline. I don't remember which one I like more. A lot of you were waiting for
[1814.39s -> 1826.12s]  this one. I have days and days, probably dozens and dozens and dozens of days played on Gold Rush.
[1828.36s -> 1836.26s]  So much time just doing the same thing, but it was so fun. That's the thing with Team Fortress 2
[1836.26s -> 1842.90s]  that no game since has been able to do, and that's doing the same fucking thing every time you play
[1842.90s -> 1852.58s]  was always fun because there were so many variables in the game to make it so it didn't matter that
[1852.58s -> 1856.82s]  the same goal was happening. There were so many things happening inside of that game.
[1857.70s -> 1872.97s]  Nobody's been able to do it since. Not sad music. Well, it should be. Building a century in TF2
[1872.97s -> 1881.10s]  in the same spot in Gold Rush. I know where it is. I can see it. Hundreds of times. Every single time
[1881.10s -> 1895.96s]  was fun. Every time. That's not the same for other games. Even when Overwatch came out and I played
[1895.96s -> 1901.32s]  Overwatch, the thing that really grabbed me in Overwatch that I really, really liked, I thought
[1901.32s -> 1911.35s]  it was really, really awesome, was the pig guy. What was his name? Hogwash? What's the guy's name?
[1914.12s -> 1923.32s]  Roadhog. The chain was, I loved it. I loved it. I loved the chain so much. And Zenyatta's orbs.
[1924.04s -> 1928.92s]  Putting the healing orb on people and the chain where those do it every single time, do it every
[1928.92s -> 1935.10s]  single game. And it's always fun. But it was the only two things that I really can pull out that
[1935.10s -> 1944.87s]  I thought were that fun. And maybe running around as Lucio. But something about the maps and how
[1944.87s -> 1954.62s]  messy it got. It got real messy. TF2 got messy. But not like shields and everywhere. There's a
[1954.62s -> 1965.08s]  million people. It's like less people but more bullshit. It's just kind of hard to look at
[1965.08s -> 1973.67s]  sometimes. You could have 30 people in a TF2 server and you would still almost be at the crest
[1973.67s -> 1979.83s]  of the amount of just weird bullshit on the screen that happens with one 5v5 Overwatch match.
[1980.79s -> 1989.67s]  Nobody's been able to really come that close. Overwatch was really damn close though.
[1990.63s -> 1994.71s]  I had a lot of fun playing the first four or five months of that game. I really did.
[1995.67s -> 2001.18s]  But it just didn't hold me. It held me for about six months. And then I was like,
[2002.14s -> 2007.86s]  but that's still... I mean in the grand scheme of things. Playing a game for like
[2007.86s -> 2015.70s]  four or five six months straight. I mean that's pretty good. I would have loved to have it hold
[2015.70s -> 2026.10s]  me forever. Held me for about three or four months. Same. Yeah. I think that's really what
[2026.10s -> 2029.46s]  it comes down to that's wrong with Overwatch. There's only 12 people in an Overwatch game.
[2029.46s -> 2033.46s]  But there's 10 times more bullshit than having 60 people be in a TF2 game.
[2034.50s -> 2044.71s]  I mean you can make fun of Valve as much as you want. But they took almost a decade to make this
[2044.71s -> 2051.59s]  game. Changing things. Redoing things. They took almost 10 fucking years to make this. So it had
[2051.59s -> 2063.53s]  everything they wanted. The classics will always remain timeless. Yeah. But TF2 is probably the
[2063.61s -> 2070.98s]  last game that I really really wanted to play every day. Feels bad, man. Feels bad, man.
[2071.70s -> 2083.93s]  Because now this stuff holds my... Pay no attention to that. Stuff holds my attention now.
[2084.65s -> 2090.65s]  Like I'm sure a lot of you can agree. But I'm not into the... I'm really not into VR at all.
[2090.65s -> 2094.65s]  And that's what's currently like holding a bunch of people's attention is like stuff like Fortnite,
[2094.65s -> 2101.61s]  Apex, the Call of Duty stuff. I just don't... It doesn't do it for me. Same thing with MOBAs too.
[2101.61s -> 2107.18s]  Smite was probably the last one that I thought was actually pretty fun. But like Beta Smite. And
[2107.18s -> 2112.62s]  like maybe just barely after release Smite was awesome. And then I don't know. I wasn't really
[2112.62s -> 2116.94s]  into it after a while. Same deal like another like four to six months and that was it. I gave up on
[2116.94s -> 2129.69s]  it. Beta Smite was perfect. It was so good. VR is just temporary fad. It will die in the next few
[2129.69s -> 2137.53s]  years. I'm not so sure about that. People were saying that when stuff like DayZ was kind of
[2137.53s -> 2141.69s]  getting to be really popular and they were like ah this is this is just fad. This would be gone
[2141.69s -> 2153.46s]  in a few years. And then Fortnite is still huge. PUBG. Yeah PUBG came after DayZ. And I wish I...
[2153.46s -> 2160.17s]  I wish I liked those games. I really do. Because I would be playing them. And like stuff like
[2160.17s -> 2164.97s]  Counter-Strike is always going to be around. CS GO is just always going to be popular. It's a
[2164.97s -> 2171.37s]  high kind of skill ceiling team FPS. I mean people love CS GO. I just... Not for me.
[2172.25s -> 2182.54s]  Never played Tribes Ascend. Yes it was fantastic. Hi-Rez did this really really great
[2183.18s -> 2190.30s]  job on the first like six months of their games being released. And then they kind of didn't...
[2190.30s -> 2196.95s]  They went to shit. The first like four to six months of Tribes Ascend. What an un-fucking
[2196.95s -> 2201.35s]  believable experience. The first like four to six months of Smite. What an un-fucking believable
[2201.35s -> 2213.61s]  experience. I think that Hi-Rez has made like just base video game has made some of the better
[2213.61s -> 2222.26s]  video games in the last decade. Like just straight up just like Tribes Ascend as a video game.
[2222.98s -> 2228.10s]  Forget about like any patches of what they did. But like when that first released
[2228.90s -> 2239.62s]  it was amazing. Video game. Video game. Video game. When they made a video game. All right I'm
[2239.62s -> 2247.35s]  gonna get back to this. Hi-Rez abandoned their games. I don't think... No they didn't. They just
[2247.35s -> 2251.27s]  focused on other stuff. They kind of spread themselves out. Focused on the new thing. Focused
[2251.27s -> 2263.85s]  on the new thing. No they... Well they did... Yeah Tribes. Yeah you're right. They did. They kind of
[2263.85s -> 2277.18s]  just gave up on Tribes. They actually abandoned Tribes. Yes they did. If Tribes got the same kind
[2277.18s -> 2291.80s]  of TF2 treatment I would probably still be playing it. Anyways let's continue. Dirty Bomb. I actually
[2291.80s -> 2297.18s]  never played Dirty Bomb. Maybe for like a... No I never played Dirty Bomb. I remember. I couldn't
[2297.18s -> 2304.46s]  install it. What happened? Some of you guys might remember this. This was on stream like six years
[2304.46s -> 2311.34s]  ago. What happened? Remember? Who was around for that? I tried to play it. I got like locked out.
[2311.34s -> 2318.55s]  I couldn't install it. Me and Star were playing it. Like he was playing it. I was just watching
[2318.55s -> 2330.14s]  this. I couldn't install it. You made a meme during Star's video about what a shitty dream
[2330.14s -> 2342.79s]  playing Dirty Bomb would be. I don't remember. I don't remember. I never played Lawbreakers. No.
[2343.43s -> 2348.31s]  Because I saw the writing on the wall with Lawbreakers from the second they announced it.
[2349.67s -> 2353.99s]  I knew if I got into it that the thing was just going to be dead anyways. Like I just knew I could
[2353.99s -> 2361.34s]  see it from a mile away. That first gameplay trailer I was like that's probably going to be
[2361.34s -> 2370.66s]  a failure. But it looks... I'm not going to invest into that. Because if you do... Let's say you
[2370.66s -> 2373.78s]  invest a shitload of time into a game. Like this probably people that... That's not to say I don't
[2373.78s -> 2376.74s]  think the game was any good. I don't have an opinion. I can't have an opinion on it because
[2376.74s -> 2382.26s]  I didn't play it. But if you really liked Lawbreakers, you were a huge fan of Lawbreakers.
[2385.30s -> 2389.38s]  That got to hurt if you were one of the people that like really cared about that game.
[2391.19s -> 2395.43s]  And you put a bunch of time into it. And you played a bunch of it. And then they're just like
[2395.43s -> 2404.04s]  yeah that's it. Like oh well fuck I really liked this. Halo on PC in two weeks. That's another
[2404.04s -> 2411.58s]  thing to be excited for. If you're one of the 19 players. That's mean. That's mean. Oh Joel's in
[2411.58s -> 2417.56s]  the chat. Joel's in the chat. What's up Joel? What do you... What do you got? You got something for me?
[2418.20s -> 2438.20s]  Huh? Hmm. Why you not VIP'd so I could like see what you're writing? VIP Varg Skelethor.
[2438.76s -> 2458.02s]  That's correct right? Varg Skelethor. All right what's up? Would you be up for playing
[2458.02s -> 2469.16s]  Tribes Ascend with our viewers? Let's revive it man. We have the power. Is the game still turned on?
[2473.80s -> 2484.06s]  The switch is still on in that game. Is it? Yeah is it? Did they turn off the servers? Why do I
[2484.06s -> 2502.38s]  feel like they did? I would I would play Tribes. What's your schedule look like? It's unlisted on
[2502.38s -> 2518.84s]  Steam. Is it unlisted? I think you have to get it right from Hi-Rez right? Play Titanfall 2 instead.
[2519.40s -> 2535.14s]  Hey hit me DM me on Discord. We'll talk about it. Titanfall 2 is good. Titanfall 2 campaign.
[2535.70s -> 2551.43s]  What you want to do the Titanfall 2 co-op campaign? Does that exist? That doesn't exist right?
[2551.43s -> 2558.52s]  There's no co-op. Oh the game sucks then. All right let me finish this up but hit me up. I'll
[2558.52s -> 2562.68s]  message you on Discord. I also heard you watched my 3d movie maker thing. It was fucking fantastic.
[2563.88s -> 2571.18s]  Seriously it was fucking great. I loved every second of it. When we watch it in the future?
[2571.18s -> 2580.10s]  Oh I will. What better time to watch Joel's movie than when he's here?
[2581.85s -> 2588.97s]  No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no. Joel he's got to go. He just said he
[2588.97s -> 2595.50s]  had to leave. Joel what you got an appointment? He just said in the chat I've got a I've got an
[2595.50s -> 2610.09s]  appointment I have to get to. I need to respect that. What's a ping like from Sweden to Nevada?
[2614.94s -> 2623.62s]  Yes my appointment at 4am. See can we like even play games together? Oh we're gonna have like
[2623.62s -> 2635.66s]  700 ping. Sorry you can host. I'll take the disadvantage. You know what I mean? Madagascar
[2635.66s -> 2643.86s]  lion move. All right fast lane I don't know. Surgeon I don't know. Swift water pretty good.
[2647.50s -> 2655.50s]  Double cross not good. Foundry don't like it. But not yeah it's actually except everything's
[2655.50s -> 2666.78s]  better than steel. So cold front yeah that goes up here. Pretty good map. High pass I don't remember
[2666.78s -> 2676.09s]  really. I don't but I probably should. Gullywash I don't remember. I do though. It's been a long
[2676.09s -> 2685.98s]  time. Mountain lab I really did not like mountain lab. Thought it was too. Moss rock don't know.
[2685.98s -> 2695.66s]  Gravel pit. One of the only maps with more than two points that's going to be up past AB. Ghost
[2695.66s -> 2700.30s]  town don't know. Standen don't know. Decoy I don't know. Metalworks I have no idea. Coaltown don't
[2700.30s -> 2705.34s]  know. Snowy coast probably played it maybe once. Manworks don't remember. Enclosure don't remember.
[2705.34s -> 2713.78s]  Yukon don't remember. Yeah I do but it wasn't very good. Freight no. Sunshine don't know. Landfall
[2713.78s -> 2721.26s]  don't know. Big rock don't know. Brickyard don't know. Okay let's get this right. Best map in the
[2721.26s -> 2743.94s]  whole game. The best team fortress 2 map is gorge. Then thunder mountain. Then gold rush. Then dust
[2743.94s -> 2767.03s]  bowl. Then upward. Then hoodoo. Then nucleus. Then harvard. Then frontier. No front no. Then
[2767.03s -> 2782.52s]  bat no. Then bad water. Then borneo. Then barn blitz. Then gravel pit. Then high tower. No then
[2782.52s -> 2790.20s]  lakeside no. Lakeside sucks actually get it down here. Um then viaduct. Then high tower. Then
[2790.20s -> 2801.22s]  turbine. Then twofort. Then nightfall. Cold front is better than twofort. Lakeside is better than
[2801.22s -> 2808.95s]  pipeline and nightfall. Swift water is better than all these I remember. Process is probably
[2808.95s -> 2814.31s]  better than this. Five gorge is still gorge so it belongs at least in head granary. Uh the rest of
[2814.31s -> 2821.24s]  these can stay in the same spot. What is the worst map that I've played in team fortress 2? It is
[2821.24s -> 2828.97s]  probably it's steel. Steel junction are the two worst. Double cross is also awful because it's
[2828.97s -> 2833.61s]  that big road with the one way to get in. You have to go down. Yeah double cross is terrible.
[2834.49s -> 2847.74s]  Um digroot keep. Mountain lab should be down here too. Better than digroot. No it's not. Hydro.
[2847.74s -> 2868.09s]  Doomsday sucks. Doomsday really sucks. And it's not even the map's fault. It's the terrible
[2868.09s -> 2881.82s]  game mode that it's on. Last. Doomsday is worse than steel. I don't know though. I don't think
[2881.82s -> 2893.75s]  it's the worst thing in the whole game. I'm trying to think if I see it pop up in the server changing
[2893.75s -> 2900.73s]  map loading screen. How fast am I leaving? It's pretty close probably. I don't want to play
[2900.73s -> 2908.46s]  doomsday. Digroot keep as well. I just don't want to play it. It was fun for like a week or two and
[2908.46s -> 2913.66s]  it was melee only. Storm the castle was fun but not after like a month. You just don't want to
[2913.66s -> 2926.66s]  play it anymore. Uh I think this is good. Yukon is okay. Yukon actually is kind of good.
[2930.79s -> 2937.24s]  Yeah Yukon's actually all right. Yukon actually I'm remembering now actually Yukon should probably
[2937.24s -> 2945.51s]  be up here. Yukon's better than these two. Is Yukon better than the lakeside though?
[2956.34s -> 2964.74s]  No that's actually worse than pipeline. Okay so that's it. I'm good. Here's your list. Hydro never
[2964.74s -> 2972.23s]  got a chance. I'd still rather play Hydro than steel. I'd rather play Hydro than Egypt. No that's
[2972.23s -> 2981.34s]  not true. I'd rather play Egypt than Hydro. I'd rather play Kong King than Hydro. Guys I really
[2981.34s -> 2995.54s]  want to bring all and I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. Yeah I'm gonna bring every five CP map down
[2995.54s -> 3014.71s]  to F. I would rather play Egypt than well CP. I'd rather play Kong King than five gorge. Goodbye.
[3028.66s -> 3038.47s]  Sawmill Coff is okay and stay. Lakeside where are we at? Swiftwater process.
[3039.19s -> 3046.36s]  I just would not play it. Sawmill's capture the flag is just turtle mania. You just get two
[3046.36s -> 3050.68s]  engineers that sit in the room. The fucking tiny little room that you get the actual briefcase from
[3050.68s -> 3054.28s]  and they just have two engineers there. And nope you can't win. Nobody you can't play the game.
[3054.28s -> 3066.50s]  So it's not right. I hate it. Ah now I gotta fix this. I'd rather play Sawmill King of the Hill
[3066.50s -> 3072.33s]  than these two. I'd rather play Yukon than those two. I'd rather play I don't have any E's left.
[3072.33s -> 3083.02s]  Yes I will. Kong King, Hydro all the way to the bottom. I would definitely not rather play
[3083.02s -> 3092.36s]  Mountain Lab. Sawmill capture the flag I'd rather do besides the like competitive five CP maps.
[3093.16s -> 3102.30s]  Let's get these all the way at the bottom where they belong though. Five gorge is gorge so it
[3102.30s -> 3122.95s]  gets to be up to the highest. There you go. Wait I'd rather play Snakewater and Swiftwater
[3123.93s -> 3139.96s]  than Pipeline and Nightfall. They belong down here. They're trash. They're not good. Done. No.
[3142.97s -> 3156.47s]  I hate Egypt but I don't mind it. All right it's official. It's official. There you are.
[3157.03s -> 3178.50s]  I'll go slow so you can see. I'm malding right now from this list. Well look everybody knows
[3178.50s -> 3185.93s]  just everybody. Oops don't break anything. Sorry I was doing like the like I'm a magician like
[3185.93s -> 3192.57s]  magic act with my hands. Um everybody these the S and from S to B everybody loves these.
[3193.61s -> 3197.61s]  Maybe you don't have them in the same spot but this is like these are the top maps of the game.
[3198.65s -> 3207.93s]  I think that's a pretty fair S through B. I just don't like five CP and that's my preference you
[3207.93s -> 3214.97s]  know. I'm a king of the hill and a uh attack defense in payload. Mostly king of the hill in
[3214.97s -> 3223.26s]  payload. Two fourths too high. That's just because I have a love-hate relationship with
[3223.26s -> 3234.30s]  it. Same with Dustbowl. What's next? This is fun. This is like I'm having this is chill man. This
[3234.30s -> 3256.66s]  is cool. I haven't met anyone ever that likes Turbine. German tier list? No I remember that
[3256.66s -> 3267.46s]  from last time. I'm not doing it. Full metal alchemist characters. I don't think oh Bloodborne
[3267.46s -> 3273.54s]  trick weapons. Hell yeah. Let's do this one. Spoilers for Bloodborne if you've never seen it.
[3274.18s -> 3290.98s]  Does this have the DLC in it too? Uh okay let's go. All right man now this is not what I think the
[3290.98s -> 3299.91s]  best weapon in the game is. This is what I think I like to play with the most. Fuck the cane.
[3300.95s -> 3308.82s]  I hate the cane. Uh it's gonna be tricky. Where's the where's the where's the moonlit sword?
[3314.78s -> 3322.47s]  Is that is that the moonlit sword? Uh I desperately tried to get this
[3323.27s -> 3330.26s]  but I didn't I I gave up. Making a magic character in Bloodborne was
[3331.30s -> 3337.06s]  just I hate it. I am having just all arcane. You get like two or three different options.
[3341.62s -> 3355.56s]  I wish I could use it. I haven't I can't use it. This thing was good but I wouldn't want to use
[3355.56s -> 3359.88s]  it the whole time. The whirligig saw was I mean just cool but I wouldn't want to use it.
[3359.88s -> 3367.56s]  Uh I never got a chance to use the bow so I'm just gonna never done it. I have to make a new
[3367.56s -> 3377.29s]  category. All right D is the category I have never used it. Where's the my favorite weapon?
[3379.08s -> 3386.55s]  There it is. I love this thing. The big like chain swing weapon. Oh this is the side right?
[3386.55s -> 3401.98s]  Where's the bow? Am I stupid? This is it right here. That's the bow right? Yeah I never played
[3401.98s -> 3412.55s]  with the side. I did use the wheel for a little bit but it was bad. It was fun for a little bit.
[3413.27s -> 3421.18s]  Uh I didn't. Where's this the the best the best weapon in the game? This one right here right?
[3423.51s -> 3440.73s]  All these were good. Bad. The saw spear. I have that. Is that incorrect? Oh that's the wrong one
[3440.73s -> 3452.60s]  yeah. These are all great. These are boring choices. I know but this is not this is not a boring
[3452.60s -> 3458.47s]  choice. This is like one of the cool DLC weapons. Pizza cutter is better than the saw spear. Yeah
[3458.47s -> 3463.59s]  also I like this too. This was a lot of fun to use because you could actually play for the first
[3463.59s -> 3472.47s]  like two-thirds of the game with arcane. Uh this one was cool but not that useful. This is the um
[3472.47s -> 3480.17s]  that weird arm weapon. Yeah we're gonna put we'll put the boring ones down here. I mean these are
[3480.17s -> 3492.06s]  just like those are the best weapons but they're boring. I did never use the blood uh tinge weapons.
[3492.06s -> 3495.02s]  Although I did I actually used this one for a little while. This is a strength one.
[3497.38s -> 3505.85s]  It was all right. The boom hammer sucks. It's like it's probably worse than the cane.
[3506.49s -> 3516.92s]  It's fun to use. Uh this one I'm gonna put it down here because every single person that ever plays
[3516.92s -> 3521.48s]  Bloodborne uses this weapon for the whole game. I was one of them on my first playthrough. Um it's
[3521.48s -> 3527.16s]  either this one or this one. I'm gonna put them down here. So I just imagine like I didn't play
[3527.16s -> 3537.43s]  with these. They're fantastic weapons but like everybody plays with them. So actually you know
[3537.43s -> 3545.00s]  they actually belong up here with the boring ones because they just be they're just good. Now the
[3545.00s -> 3549.64s]  gun blade stuff is something that I have no experience with because I never really did it.
[3550.44s -> 3555.35s]  This is the weird hand arm thing. I thought it wasn't I hated this thing. You have to get
[3555.35s -> 3560.31s]  that one specific holding R2 with the little arm comes out and stabs him the head. It's hard to use.
[3561.27s -> 3572.44s]  I know this is probably the best weapon at least from the DLC in the game but I would probably
[3572.44s -> 3582.66s]  rather use all these instead of the the default ones and this too. This is just fun. That arm
[3582.66s -> 3587.14s]  is god tier. Yeah but it's just I didn't like using it. It was like the boom hammer. It was that one
[3587.14s -> 3593.75s]  gimmick with the little thing that comes out. Like this has a gimmick but I can still use it as like
[3593.75s -> 3602.89s]  a sword. I know this is a club too. This makes me want to play the game again for like the
[3603.37s -> 3610.06s]  sixth time. How do I fast forward to the next list? It'll be done very soon don't worry.
[3612.63s -> 3617.03s]  Um I don't remember these. The gun spear I don't know. I didn't really use them.
[3619.54s -> 3623.14s]  No. If I ever played through Bloodborne again I would use one of these weapons.
[3624.18s -> 3628.84s]  This is the these things were awesome and I remember getting so angry trying to get these.
[3629.64s -> 3633.48s]  The maddest I've ever been probably in a video game. Spoiler alert for the DLC.
[3634.44s -> 3637.16s]  When you go like just mute the stream fucking hurry up.
[3641.14s -> 3648.86s]  Getting this weapon was one of the most rage inducing moments ever. This is the the dual
[3648.86s -> 3656.46s]  blades thing that you get but there's two of those weird huge sliding shark face monster people down
[3656.46s -> 3668.66s]  there. Wrong weapon? Wait is it? No it's not. No it's not. This is the the the dual weapons right?
[3671.13s -> 3674.17s]  No right right right right right right. The one that's down there. Which one is it?
[3674.89s -> 3679.77s]  This is that's the crow. Yeah right right right. Stay muted. We're talking about spoilers here.
[3680.33s -> 3685.61s]  Yes that's a crow. That's this one. What it's the which one is it? It's this one here right?
[3690.86s -> 3699.43s]  Yeah okay and I wanted to use it because it was so interesting so cool but those trying to fight
[3699.43s -> 3704.39s]  those two things at the same time was so painful. All right now you can unmute but holy shit that
[3704.39s -> 3711.93s]  was I remember being so angry at that game fighting two of those things. Shaman bone I know
[3711.93s -> 3720.10s]  but holy fuck I if you don't know that you are in deep shit. I love Bloodborne but haven't used
[3720.10s -> 3728.02s]  like half the weapons. Isn't that part of the fun? Isn't part of like oh okay playthrough one used
[3728.02s -> 3731.06s]  uh let's see what I'll go through every playthrough. You ready?
[3733.86s -> 3738.10s]  First playthrough of Bloodborne. So take your screenshot this is what I have to say okay now
[3738.10s -> 3743.91s]  this is the first playthrough up here. This is my first playthrough. I use these two. Second
[3743.91s -> 3747.51s]  playthrough. Vita holy shit this game's fucking like game best game I've ever played my whole life.
[3747.51s -> 3755.06s]  Second playthrough. These two. Oh wow this is amazing. So much fun. Third playthrough.
[3755.94s -> 3763.34s]  I was I think I was just like a normal asshole. Third playthrough I remember specifically
[3763.90s -> 3772.70s]  desperately wanting to get this and I think I probably used I think I actually used the hammer
[3774.22s -> 3780.78s]  and then I gave up at like the spoiler alert. If you give up at this point here you've already
[3780.78s -> 3787.34s]  played through the whole damn game. I just spoiled it whatever. Yes yes because I got to the point
[3787.34s -> 3793.22s]  where I was trying to fight orphan with a fucking boom hammer and I was like this is like this is
[3793.22s -> 3807.64s]  not possible to do. I'm done. Quick remute. Okay so that's playthrough number one two three four.
[3808.92s -> 3813.32s]  Playthrough number five. I did a let's do I did like a comedy playthrough so I wanted this is
[3813.32s -> 3826.01s]  these are the two I did. Done. I've played through the game like five times. I mean I've I used these
[3826.65s -> 3835.80s]  which have I not actually physically touched. Everything down here is what I have not even
[3835.80s -> 3844.01s]  physically used. Oh no no no no no this this is up this was during the comedy run. This is what I
[3844.01s -> 3857.35s]  ended up with during like the strength comedy run. Okay yeah I have not equipped any of the
[3857.35s -> 3861.35s]  weapons below because I didn't I like didn't have time wasn't doing the build or didn't want to use
[3861.35s -> 3872.89s]  it. Show us your saves to prove this. I have not had this PlayStation 4 in probably three and a
[3872.89s -> 3885.96s]  half years. What about the steak driver? Where is it? It's uh the oh right yeah okay yeah sorry sorry
[3885.96s -> 3903.77s]  I've used it but maybe for like 30 minutes. Can I unmute? You can yes unmute. You played the game
[3903.77s -> 3908.65s]  five times and never touched half the weapons? I mean I physically maybe had them in my inventory
[3908.65s -> 3914.65s]  but I never used them because you have to level up stuff. You have to upgrade your weapons and I
[3914.65s -> 3919.13s]  just was like I don't feel like using that. That's kind of cool you know you get a weapon in these
[3919.13s -> 3925.85s]  games and you take like two or three swings and you go nah and then you just put it away.
[3930.79s -> 3937.35s]  Respecs make it harder. Yeah yeah you have to you can't just be doing a strength build and then all
[3937.35s -> 3943.82s]  of a sudden be like you know what I want to use the bow. There you go. I mean this is this is not
[3943.82s -> 3950.47s]  my tier list. We already went over that. Now give me another one. It's the type of game where you can
[3950.47s -> 3958.07s]  just beat it with the whole game with one weapon. Yeah. Bloodborne bosses? Hey this is spoilers
[3958.07s -> 3964.10s]  though. That was really fast. A lot of people like did like a boss ranking thing. That was quick.
[3964.90s -> 3971.82s]  But if you haven't played Bloodborne or you don't do you really all souls Bloodborne all souls bosses?
[3972.70s -> 3999.75s]  I don't even remember half of these. The every souls boss. Um wrong one. Can we uh
[4003.62s -> 4007.70s]  possible emotes? Nah we're gonna do that later. We're gonna do that a different day.
[4009.86s -> 4014.42s]  We're gonna do like another emote contest like soon here probably early 2020 but don't worry.
[4016.98s -> 4050.58s]  Dead rising all psychos. How does that exist? What the fuck is this? Uh look at the url on this one.
[4051.06s -> 4072.50s]  What the fuck? Page unresponsive. What the fuck are you talking about? Did you just give me like
[4072.50s -> 4088.07s]  a virus? All right give me another one. I like this. This is fun. Virus until you watch the movie
[4088.07s -> 4097.30s]  then your like a desktop gets unlocked again. Terraria bosses? No I can't do that one.
[4098.10s -> 4115.67s]  Just so people stop spamming this. This is like spoilers too. You can't do tier list without

[5063.56s -> 5068.76s]  now I wasn't a fan of like the the bounce off dialogue from the main characters
[5070.60s -> 5075.98s]  quadruple here these guys were only in the room to like have somebody to respond to the main
[5075.98s -> 5083.10s]  character when they talked it was still like have dialogue a dialogue b dialogue a dialogue b

[5316.54s -> 5321.58s]  okay okay and then I remember who that is yeah that you are definitely cooler than Dr Marco
[5321.58s -> 5326.94s]  Dr Marco is like the worst of all like the characters that have been in more than 10
[5326.94s -> 5346.49s]  episodes all right I'm done give me another one what time is it holy shit I've been doing
[5346.49s -> 5353.75s]  this for a long time animals at the zoo that's actually pretty fucking sick I'm gonna do animals
[5353.75s -> 5402.98s]  at the zoo this is gonna be tricky this is actually gonna be very hard to do uh all right
[5402.98s -> 5410.18s]  you're gonna but why why are why are tigers and cats so low because it's that and like dogs like
[5410.18s -> 5416.46s]  wolves are low too just because that's not that big it's like not that big of a deal to see like
[5416.54s -> 5422.60s]  a lot like a tiger at a zoo like a lion at the zoo that's if you saw an armadillo or like a
[5422.60s -> 5427.00s]  monitor lizard at the zoo that's pretty cool I mean it's cool but I don't know that I don't
[5427.00s -> 5432.76s]  hate that I think it's interesting a pig at the zoo but pigs are like one of my favorite animals
[5436.28s -> 5439.72s]  these are awesome yes I know but if I'm going to the zoo I'm going right to the pig den
[5455.56s -> 5460.92s]  it's hard to it's hard to put any of these in the hate category I don't hate any of these animals
[5466.10s -> 5481.08s]  no I don't I don't hate otter no I don't hate any of these how could you hate something like this
[5490.42s -> 5493.38s]  this is just the pictures kind of pictures I take when I go on vacation
[5498.17s -> 5507.75s]  uh iguana is s-tier I don't I disagree monitor lizard is s-tier let me correct that quickly for
[5507.75s -> 5533.74s]  you koalas hippopotamus I don't I can't put anything down in hate all right let's just get
[5533.74s -> 5563.14s]  this over with okay all the cats are in one spot that would be cool that'd be really cool actually
[5576.90s -> 5586.34s]  I don't hate it I don't hate like geese or whatever a swan but that's not that that's not
[5586.34s -> 5591.78s]  that interesting to me it's that's a swan that's you can see swans everywhere we're talking about
[5591.78s -> 5606.38s]  at the zoo if you go to the zoo I want to see something besides a fucking goose it's a pelican
[5606.86s -> 5622.82s]  it's staying now that's fucking cool llama that's all right now I'm sticking with it
[5622.82s -> 5628.76s]  I'll tell you why because I go a llama you can go to a petting you it's not that
[5631.10s -> 5648.74s]  and they spit on you yes I'm only going by going to the zoo the petting zoo is a zoo I don't want
[5648.74s -> 5653.54s]  to get spit on I don't want to get spit on I don't I'm changing this to a different I don't
[5654.50s -> 5689.22s]  like okay then this is going to be like I would just I would walk by and go look at the lion
[5690.18s -> 5712.02s]  all right let's get going it's a moose I mean I just I would enjoy it elephants that's pretty
[5712.02s -> 5719.38s]  fucking cool platypus get the fuck up there not all the way that's where the monitor wizard
[5719.94s -> 5726.14s]  hippopotamus is pretty cool I mean the seals I would probably just I mean they're cool but
[5726.14s -> 5728.94s]  I would just look for a few seconds I would just sit there and be like all right let's go
[5728.94s -> 5746.09s]  zebras same thing um zebra's ass same thing I feel like you can only look at uh I've never I've
[5746.09s -> 5754.46s]  never seen I've never gone to one I've never seen an orca like I don't I don't know what my
[5754.46s -> 5763.14s]  reaction would be because I've never seen one indifferent indifferent uh no this is just the
[5763.14s -> 5769.88s]  dinosaur in Jurassic Park that runs around really small and the t-rex eats them I don't I don't I'm
[5769.88s -> 5787.16s]  not gonna I don't care it's like I guess it's okay it's a filler animal yeah but a panda would be
[5787.16s -> 5795.50s]  kind of cool I'll fix this gorilla yeah all the apes just do cool shit they do funny interesting
[5795.50s -> 5807.30s]  shit they're just interesting this thing is just gonna float around they just go forward and I love
[5807.30s -> 5815.48s]  birds I got a peacock up here but you'll sit and watch the orangutan like eat an orange for five
[5815.48s -> 5824.25s]  minutes straight just because you're gonna do that they've even I've never even I've never seen
[5824.25s -> 5829.74s]  polar bears are cool but I don't think I've ever seen one what is this a dolphin isn't this cool
[5830.30s -> 5844.23s]  koala I mean that's really cool but I I love turtles and I this is something coming from
[5844.23s -> 5854.14s]  somebody that is a reptile fan but they're pretty boring at the zoo at the zoo at the zoo remember
[5855.02s -> 5858.14s]  at the zoo the turtles are all just gonna sit and look at you
[5863.02s -> 5866.62s]  don't tell me that I don't like reptiles I've got a monitor and that is number one
[5871.58s -> 5886.78s]  I'd do it for 15 seconds um foxes are cool I'm gonna I'll fix it wait isn't this a seal
[5887.50s -> 5893.94s]  what's this then wait isn't there another seal that's okay that's an otter seal with the element
[5894.90s -> 5904.44s]  what's that that's a sea lion no I would look for 15 seconds they're kind of no that's kind
[5904.44s -> 5914.57s]  of higher up too I'm gonna fix it bears I mean I bears are cool I love bears was this a vulture
[5915.13s -> 5922.95s]  I probably looked for 15 seconds hyena they're pretty cool lemur pretty cool other like super
[5922.95s -> 5942.33s]  pig yep this is like this is piggy and then like piggy otto and then oh mega pig these are all
[5942.33s -> 5959.16s]  right all right now let me get this right that's that's the real timeline right there that's the
[5959.16s -> 5976.30s]  real omega pig okay so how do I what do I change here people is a titan pig
[5983.91s -> 5997.94s]  yeah uh yeah that's correct let's just stay all right let's get this one right monitor lizard
[5998.90s -> 6006.92s]  yeah I'm gonna have one of these before I before I die I will make a promise to me before the day
[6006.92s -> 6016.10s]  I die I'm going to own a like two to three foot long fucking monitor lizard maybe not a monitor
[6016.10s -> 6024.15s]  but like at least a one to two foot long lizard like a tegu or a maybe even a monitor
[6024.79s -> 6039.46s]  before the day I die they're so interesting tegu is the way to go monitors suck I've been in my
[6039.46s -> 6053.74s]  research tegus are huge yeah I know I know okay ostrich platypus what a cool animal that god just
[6053.74s -> 6056.78s]  said fuck it and like threw a bunch of shit in a blender and then dumped it on the ground like
[6056.78s -> 6064.02s]  that's so what an awesome what an interesting animal the god was late for class and like had
[6064.02s -> 6079.61s]  to do his homework real quick uh yeah cool one of the coolest animals on earth these huge birds are
[6079.61s -> 6085.11s]  just so interesting too what are you doing up here get out of here oh wait that's an otter
[6092.20s -> 6111.27s]  yeah I think otters are cooler than the omega pig titan pig evolution but I still love them peacock
[6111.27s -> 6119.99s]  is gonna come down a little uh orang-tangs are awesome gorillas are really really cool uh iguanas
[6121.58s -> 6127.56s]  alligators are fucking cool too though I wouldn't put them I would rather go look at a giraffe and
[6127.56s -> 6144.94s]  an elephant than an alligator though because they kind of just stand around they just sit there I
[6144.94s -> 6154.62s]  don't think that's fair I would just look at the snake for 15 seconds the snakes don't do anything
[6161.14s -> 6166.10s]  alligators don't do anything but they're huge monitors are actually really interesting they
[6166.10s -> 6173.21s]  run around they stay like they like have their big tongues that come out they like look at you
[6173.21s -> 6184.20s]  they're they're very very excited what a way cooler version of a lion this is a lion with scales
[6184.20s -> 6203.48s]  and a big tongue that comes up they have chain male skeletons that's wow that's pretty dope
[6206.07s -> 6217.66s]  okay but I don't really snakes don't I love reptiles and amphibians but snakes don't do
[6217.66s -> 6222.94s]  it for me they they're really really cool they're really interesting they have a lot of really
[6223.82s -> 6235.21s]  they have great designs on their skin and stuff and so many different types they have some fun
[6235.21s -> 6256.06s]  personalities uh they're not really plus they're the devil that should be down here guys I'm sorry
[6256.06s -> 6260.55s]  if you can walk into a pet smart and see this that's not something that's that cool to look
[6260.55s -> 6272.02s]  at at the zoo they're different don't I don't hate any none of these animals I love all of
[6272.02s -> 6288.71s]  these animals all of them it's just who I prefer then put them under love but that's not how a
[6288.71s -> 6310.55s]  tier list works okay let's keep this going I want to get this right s is correct uh a is needs a
[6310.55s -> 6368.46s]  little bit of work that's correct yeah that's correct it's even more correct close done all
[6368.46s -> 6385.86s]  right down if they like ah these are cool I like these animals they're pretty cool the only reason
[6385.86s -> 6391.88s]  why people really like these is because they're in a bunch of animated movies and then everything
[6391.88s -> 6398.01s]  that they always just show up for like a minute corals are fucking horrible animals they have one
[6398.01s -> 6402.89s]  of the smallest brains to body ratios of any mammal additionally their brains are smooth the
[6402.89s -> 6409.40s]  brain is folded to increase the surface for neurons if you present a koala if you present
[6409.40s -> 6417.08s]  a koala with leaves plucked from a branch laid on a flat surface the koala will not recognize it as
[6417.08s -> 6427.38s]  food they are too thick to adapt their feeding behavior to cope with change in a room full of
[6428.02s -> 6449.43s]  food they can literally starve to death so what is that they're stupid as fuck they only survive
[6449.43s -> 6454.39s]  because their food what was it they only survive because they're because their food makes them
[6454.39s -> 6463.82s]  poisonous but look at their ears they should be extinct holy shit that's rough
[6464.54s -> 6476.09s]  flamingo is pretty cool dolphins I mean just dolphins should probably be up there yeah yeah
[6476.09s -> 6505.22s]  yeah bump bump bump bump bump bump I mean camels are cool though camel cool than a polar bear
[6505.22s -> 6531.00s]  polar bear cooler than a buff fox what's this one this is pixar fox versus hbo fox which one you
[6531.00s -> 6559.59s]  don't know what a red panda is apparently not and for that reason I'm out I'll take the pixar fox
[6559.59s -> 6567.14s]  over the fox it's cool kind of cool than an iguana is it though they both belong up here
[6567.94s -> 6582.22s]  no they don't koala brain no I thought I would I eat food if it's in front of me
[6586.57s -> 6597.98s]  okay there's the rest of this correct almost yeah yeah yeah I guess no I would rather see these
[6597.98s -> 6607.46s]  no I'd rather like see a koala though I never get to see them okay would look for 15 seconds
[6610.30s -> 6626.86s]  who would I look for 16 seconds vultures and then the lions because there you go to the lions and
[6626.86s -> 6637.40s]  you see the lions that's not a vulture what it's an anteater it's not like a like wings laid out
[6637.40s -> 6644.92s]  like like this going down assume like it's wings up see like wing up wing up just swooped down
[6644.92s -> 6649.16s]  landing grabbing something this is okay wrong that's an anteater all right those things are
[6649.16s -> 6658.60s]  awesome uh all right I would look for 15 seconds at the lion probably the most and then honestly
[6658.60s -> 6662.52s]  probably the turtle my reasoning for that is I would just open up my phone and it's this would
[6662.52s -> 6666.63s]  be where like I would be texting somebody I could probably sit there for like five straight minutes
[6667.43s -> 6678.89s]  this is my I'm taking a break section of the zoo I'd be there for 15 seconds uh it's a bobcat
[6682.14s -> 6691.19s]  slightly larger than house cat cat cool and they've got the bear beards and stuff I love them
[6691.75s -> 6716.23s]  that's a lynx isn't a link wait what do you mean it's a lynx the lynx is known by the tuft of black
[6716.23s -> 6721.99s]  hair on the tips of its ears and it's short of bobbed tail in fact one species of lynx is called
[6724.74s -> 6742.22s]  a bobcat fucking stupid goddamn fucking stupid fucking idiot fucking goddamn one species
[6742.22s -> 6759.98s]  it's still correct and for that go get a haircut that one isn't the bobcat lynxes are a bobcat
[6759.98s -> 6766.30s]  a bobcat is a lynx it's that's a bobcat it could be a bobcat just because it's a specific lynx it
[6766.30s -> 6770.54s]  could be a bobcat bobcat is a lynx lynx is a bobcat there's a species that is the bobcat
[6770.54s -> 6785.94s]  they're not entered not all lynx is a bobcat but not all but all bobcats are lynxes thank you uh
[6785.94s -> 6813.05s]  thank you appreciate it thank you can we disagree that the t-rex food is down here all right I would
[6813.05s -> 6817.77s]  look at a whale for 15 seconds I would probably weigh more than a lion all right let's finish
[6817.77s -> 6828.28s]  this up let's go with just a manatee cool you don't have to go to the zoo just live in maine
[6828.28s -> 6839.53s]  and look out your window they're huge and they're majestic but I don't not that big whatever I'm
[6839.53s -> 6845.21s]  not sure what this is just a horse or is it a zebra why the what's it what is this animal
[6845.21s -> 6859.24s]  why does it has a saddle on it that's an okapi yeah it's a fucking okapi of the zebra I'm so
[6859.24s -> 6875.38s]  sorry I'm sorry I have a hundred people leave I get it they have blue tongues
[6888.97s -> 6894.97s]  I think I'm good I think this is the list but which one of the cats besides a lion would I
[6894.97s -> 6906.78s]  want to see the most it probably that or that no that no no this is just a chat just that's
[6906.78s -> 6932.07s]  just a tiger right this is just that's that's a tiger I would pretty I would like to see that
[6933.45s -> 6975.29s]  links fuck done animal tier list complete actually done there you go Kanye West albums I can't I don't
[6977.48s -> 6992.57s]  I can't I cannot do that Star Wars films already did it days of the week um obviously like Friday

[7206.74s -> 7217.19s]  pretty damn great bagels sourdough I have to be in the mood for it pita bread up here flat flat
[7217.19s -> 7229.37s]  bread somewhere up here brioche it's oatmeal bread d whole wheat bread f rye bread somewhere in a
[7230.49s -> 7239.24s]  croissant s biscuit a potato bread is s2 no it's potato bread is a god tier absolute god tier

[7249.88s -> 7255.35s]  none up there pretzel bread not even close it's not this is not even a competition
[7259.75s -> 7267.19s]  English muffin I hate English muffins I don't like cinnamon bread any sweet bread don't like
[7267.19s -> 7273.24s]  it zucchini bread stop it's in there with the same like the oatmeal pumpernickel is
[7274.04s -> 7281.45s]  better than my friend and sourdough french bread get it up here we'll we'll fix it red stick
[7282.33s -> 7295.77s]  depends from where from where homemade or from olive garden because from the olive garden
[7296.49s -> 7309.91s]  okay little caesars I don't know about that homemade better uh I know what is what is
[7309.91s -> 7341.10s]  butter bread I don't think I've ever had this before yeast bread I butter bread butter bread
[7341.10s -> 7355.11s]  and what did yeast bread go it's just that just bread all right let's fix this I potato bread
[7355.91s -> 7362.30s]  pretzel bread I don't know how you could eat potato bread or pretzel bread and say that's
[7362.30s -> 7371.45s]  not the best thing I've ever had in my life that was made from bread huh I don't know you know
[7371.45s -> 7376.25s]  what I'm trying to say uh banana bread doesn't belong up here it was it that was a knee-jerk
[7376.25s -> 7393.08s]  reaction it should be this close it's a plus plus Hawaiian rolls better than rye pita bread
[7393.08s -> 7401.56s]  better than rye cord bread and rye are above the same naan and pita bread fantastic tortilla
[7402.60s -> 7409.61s]  flat I would actually put flat bread up above rye and we're gonna put we're gonna put rye down
[7409.61s -> 7418.04s]  here I'd rather have flour tortilla than rye garlic bread it's good but it's just a bit basic
[7418.04s -> 7427.22s]  it is I this is like snack bread it's just it's snack bread garlic bread breadsticks
[7427.78s -> 7437.11s]  it's good it's very good it's exceptional but I mean it's it's good but it's snack bread
[7438.14s -> 7441.58s]  snacks are good yes they are but would I rather have garlic bread or would I rather have
[7442.46s -> 7450.42s]  a nice french bread like with oil that's the top tier snack bread I thought I would rather have
[7450.42s -> 7454.66s]  no I would rather have bagel than garlic bread you have to be in the mood for you got to be in the
[7454.66s -> 7464.58s]  mood for garlic bread it's very heavy like really dense and cheesy sometimes and really heavy garlic
[7464.58s -> 7479.34s]  and oil it's not a light snack crude oil what the fuck are you talking about what kind of garlic
[7479.34s -> 7486.31s]  bread are you guys eating that isn't like soaked in oil and cheese that's how you make garlic bread
[7486.31s -> 7500.31s]  you put a bunch of garlic and oil on it no cheese on garlic bread it's still got oil on it you eat
[7500.31s -> 7503.35s]  what you don't have you don't put oil on your garlic bread what do you just put a clove of
[7503.35s -> 7519.50s]  garlic on a piece of bread and eat it where the fuck is their cheese on garlic bread I feel like
[7519.50s -> 7530.89s]  I'm on another planet right now am I on another planet where the fuck is their cheese and oil on
[7530.89s -> 7580.49s]  garlic bread every single restaurant that I've ever been to parmesan oil garlic oil cheese I'm
[7580.49s -> 7588.15s]  not talking about like fucking cheese whiz but what like like American slices what is happening
[7589.27s -> 7608.20s]  garlic bread recipe this is from delish.com four cloves of garlic one stick of butter
[7608.28s -> 7617.66s]  it's a it's a light snack though one french bread baguette kosher salt two tablespoons of parsley
[7617.66s -> 7626.02s]  and a fourth cup of grated parmesan cheese this is the number one thing this is the number one
[7626.02s -> 7643.88s]  recipe that you that you find I have to be an alien a half a stick of butter how many how many
[7643.88s -> 7653.40s]  days a week are you eating this no no you're not gonna pull the parmesan cheese bullshit off it's
[7653.40s -> 7661.22s]  cheese parmesan cheese is cheese just because you dust it and it's on it's cheese that's fucking
[7661.22s -> 7683.26s]  cheese it's sawdust it's different they're different parmesan or reggiano sorry what did I say
[7683.26s -> 7690.15s]  parmesan I've never had parmesan cheese on garlic bread I'm okay when I talk I feel like I'm talking
[7690.15s -> 7705.38s]  to like five different cultures here how many Americans we have in the chat press a all right
[7705.38s -> 7720.78s]  how many people from Norway we got in the chat right now press and a lot of Norwegians
[7722.62s -> 7731.38s]  can I ask the Norwegian something very very specific do you put cheese on your garlic bread
[7731.94s -> 7756.70s]  can always can always count on the Norwegians anyways no I can't do that in good conscience
[7757.34s -> 7767.34s]  would I rather have a girl would I rather have a heavy ass cheesy ass oily fucking sweaty
[7767.90s -> 7782.55s]  dumped with fucking garlic and grease or would I rather have a bagel lightly toasted with hints
[7782.55s -> 7794.17s]  of sesame with little little little chips little little sesame chips and and poppy seeds fresh

[7805.93s -> 7818.38s]  garlic bread out of a bag the bag that you just and you take the garlic bread out of the bag
[7818.38s -> 7825.46s]  and you've put it in the oven I know at least at least 20 30 percent of you guys eat the bag
[7825.46s -> 7829.06s]  garlic bread and right now you're going like so you got it in your mouth and the bag is right

[7862.98s -> 7902.17s]  you please agree with me that the potato bread is iced here oh shit Kim made zucchini bread like
[7902.17s -> 7908.18s]  last week and she just wrote in the chat uh she's like wait you don't fucking like the
[7908.26s -> 7915.34s]  zucchini bread downstairs that's not true I haven't gotten here yet
[7918.73s -> 7925.05s]  zucchini bread is your zucchini bread is fucking very good but I'm trying to figure out I'm just
[7925.05s -> 7931.69s]  going through the list I bought a potato bread is my favorite thing that's like it's like my
[7931.69s -> 7937.05s]  favorite thing in the world I don't think zucchini bread is s-tier banana look at banana bread though
[7938.01s -> 7958.17s]  he's not I'm not no I it's it's better than white bread it was stress burp I'm done this is
[7958.17s -> 7972.33s]  correct I'm done perhaps a bad croissant potato bread whatever the music was I listened to chill
[7972.33s -> 7981.34s]  I listen I'm in a fucking time machine that was a two hour long playlist didn't I just click the
[7981.34s -> 7997.40s]  play button like five minutes ago why is everybody saying monka s I like zucchini bread this is just
[7997.48s -> 8013.03s]  like my favorite breads zucchini look zucchini bread is is is good it's not down here I I like
[8013.03s -> 8023.40s]  zucchini bread oh he's going Larry David but all right hold on a second here Kim you're telling me
[8023.40s -> 8030.98s]  that zucchini bread is better than crusties with oil that's like one of my favorite things guy
[8030.98s -> 8040.39s]  that's gonna be up there bagels like a nice crunchy crispy bagel but we're talking about
[8040.39s -> 8045.11s]  zucchini bread like from the store I would not buy zucchini bread from the store but if Kim made
[8045.11s -> 8053.88s]  it it's actually really good no joke no fucking around and did I just replay the chill step mix
[8054.68s -> 8068.89s]  I think it's time to go zucchini bread is better than sourdough and pumpernickel I didn't even get
[8068.89s -> 8074.41s]  down here yet I didn't even get down to this portion I just they were they were in a row
[8075.29s -> 8084.06s]  to be fair though I've had zucchini bread twice once from Kim once from my mother and they were

[8574.42s -> 8578.66s]  tested for celiac that's initially what I thought was going on but that's not what's going on

[8633.11s -> 8638.47s]  about because I have another procedure that's coming up to try to really put the nail in the
[8638.47s -> 8644.26s]  coffin here so it's not like I'm gonna be like hey guys let's talk about my last visit and the
[8644.26s -> 8650.18s]  visit before that the visit before it no it's it's not worth really talking about it isn't

[8659.70s -> 8666.66s]  easy to be honest because it's been sort of just a random uh symptomatic of what's wrong with me
[8667.54s -> 8673.56s]  so it's not enough to cause any concern though it's just like an irritating little thing that's
[8673.56s -> 8686.39s]  just sticking around not enough to cause a problem but it's enough to be annoying I should have a

[9348.57s -> 9354.41s]  memory lane bloodborne and tf2 were the two games I would spend a ton of money on for a mind eraser
[9354.41s -> 9363.54s]  frog yeah imagine picking up team fortress 2 for the first time ever right now you just there's so
[9363.54s -> 9369.93s]  much to see I feel like it would actually be hard though because we got all that stuff trickled in
[9369.93s -> 9377.58s]  over years it's almost like the game has changed a lot since then it would be it might be actually
[9377.58s -> 9389.11s]  pretty difficult but god I wish that they would just make team fortress colon man versus machine
[9389.11s -> 9397.43s]  only I would have loved them to just to make just a just I'll pay for it I'll buy it just
[9397.43s -> 9410.12s]  let's sell it to me I'll it's 40 39.99 59.99 I'll buy it I just give it to me overwatch 2 is doing
[9410.12s -> 9425.14s]  that we don't know that for certain though we know it's a pve game like that but is it going
[9425.14s -> 9430.90s]  to be as good as man versus machine was will it be as challenging will it be as fun will it be as
[9430.90s -> 9442.25s]  much stuff to upgrade and enough enough in it see that's what I mean we don't know I'm not willing
[9442.25s -> 9452.73s]  to judge until something's around you know I'm saying hey I just made uh I just made a burger
[9452.73s -> 9459.43s]  and I think the salad I used is a bit old three months old we don't eat it just eat the burger
[9466.47s -> 9472.62s]  but uh it's been years since I played the dlc in bloodborne and here comes a bloodborne spoiler
[9473.58s -> 9478.63s]  close your ears if you haven't played it yet here it comes three two one I still haven't beaten the
[9478.63s -> 9483.27s]  orphan yet I started the dlc in new game plus and later found out that new game plus orphan is
[9483.27s -> 9492.14s]  apparently much harder than normal orphan at this point I'll have to see it well a full day to beat
[9492.14s -> 9508.36s]  it fuck me I just mute me feel 64 thanks to the five community subs and thank you snoozing
[9508.36s -> 9515.34s]  copter for the 250 yes orphan was horrendous I still would put him in the top two top three
[9515.34s -> 9524.74s]  of hardest bosses they've ever made number one is by all means is the final boss in sakiro
[9525.54s -> 9538.18s]  was insane that last true encounter in sakiro was so much to learn and so much patience
[9548.92s -> 9556.70s]  it was crazy that was an entire stream wasn't it just to try to beat that final boss
[9560.95s -> 9565.99s]  I sat there I was at that boss for at least four hours five hours right something like that
[9566.71s -> 9582.15s]  was it 50 something attempts 58 60 attempts oh but hey it was I still did it and I still enjoyed it
