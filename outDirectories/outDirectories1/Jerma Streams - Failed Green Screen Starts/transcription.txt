[72.57s -> 80.69s]  Alright, now you can hear me and the audio sucks and it's always gonna suck on German985's YouTube channel
[80.69s -> 87.09s]  And his twitch channel because he's too much of a fucking idiot to purchase a boom mic that could just hang down here
[87.43s -> 93.03s]  Off camera instead. He brought his goddamn desktop microphone all the fucking way all the way over here
[93.79s -> 96.99s]  But it's probably better than was last time if it's not then
[97.91s -> 100.59s]  Look at me because I can't fucking do anything about it
[114.70s -> 117.26s]  You all right, I can't like test this
[118.10s -> 120.97s]  Okay, you know, I'm like in like Looney Tunes
[121.53s -> 126.45s]  When like Bugs Bunny plays fucking tennis with himself. That's what I feel like I'm doing right now
[127.13s -> 129.13s]  Like I'm like, hey, can you hear me?
[148.24s -> 163.99s]  Blurry what I guess not blurry I can see it over there blurry what
[170.60s -> 208.20s]  No, I just made it darker it shouldn't be blurry
[213.63s -> 215.63s]  It's low resolution. What?
[215.63s -> 218.12s]  Am I streaming this in the wrong resolution?
[218.12s -> 247.42s]  No, it shouldn't be
[247.42s -> 257.85s]  What the fuck? What is this up wrong? It's a goddamn camera
[257.85s -> 271.93s]  What the fuck is it doing?
[271.93s -> 276.80s]  Computers. Computers suck. Don't even buy one
[276.80s -> 280.06s]  Wait, why is this? It's like broken
[280.06s -> 282.06s]  Like can you even see?
[282.06s -> 292.43s]  What the fuck is going on right now?
[292.43s -> 305.53s]  Come on. Hey
[305.53s -> 311.31s]  Can you hear me? My OBS just crashed
[311.31s -> 446.27s]  Hi, my name's German985
[446.27s -> 450.24s]  I just spent two hours
[450.24s -> 452.24s]  Trying to figure out what the fuck was wrong with my computer
[452.24s -> 469.90s]  He was crying
[469.90s -> 477.77s]  I uh
[477.77s -> 483.52s]  I uh
[483.52s -> 488.00s]  I have no idea what's going on
[488.00s -> 490.00s]  That's the honest to God truth
[490.00s -> 496.76s]  It looks like a deep thing
[496.76s -> 502.78s]  It looks like PS3 graphics
[502.78s -> 504.78s]  Let me just
[504.78s -> 528.27s]  Hey, you got something on your face
[528.27s -> 554.88s]  Any better? I just like wiped it
[554.88s -> 556.88s]  I wiped it off
[556.88s -> 563.08s]  Can you see?
[563.08s -> 577.02s]  Alright, here's the thing that makes no fucking sense
[577.02s -> 579.02s]  I'm going to level with me here
[579.02s -> 581.02s]  This is the same camera
[581.02s -> 583.02s]  This is the same computer
[583.02s -> 585.02s]  This is the same place
[585.02s -> 587.02s]  Less than 24 hours ago
[587.02s -> 592.20s]  What the fuck happened?
[592.20s -> 594.20s]  It doesn't make any sense
[594.20s -> 596.20s]  If it looks that weird
[596.20s -> 611.95s]  Give me one second
[611.95s -> 613.95s]  We're going to troubleshoot this together
[613.95s -> 615.95s]  Because I got news for you
[615.95s -> 618.89s]  I paid for this fucking spot
[618.89s -> 620.89s]  And I'm going to use it
[620.89s -> 648.52s]  What if I do this?
[648.52s -> 664.72s]  Oh fuck my leg
[664.72s -> 669.96s]  Hit the camera
[669.96s -> 675.53s]  You can see the refresh rate
[675.53s -> 677.96s]  Dude, 60 hertz
[677.96s -> 679.96s]  60 hertz refresh rate
[679.96s -> 689.10s]  What the fuck is this?
[689.10s -> 693.77s]  Can you see that?
[693.77s -> 695.77s]  That don't make no fucking sense
[695.77s -> 700.96s]  I'm looking at the preview
[700.96s -> 702.96s]  Right now
[702.96s -> 705.13s]  I'm looking at the preview in OBS
[705.13s -> 707.13s]  It's perfect
[707.13s -> 709.13s]  This shit is perfect on OBS
[709.13s -> 711.44s]  What the heck is happening here?
[711.44s -> 726.48s]  It's perfect on OBS
[726.48s -> 729.48s]  Dude, 30 fps
[729.48s -> 733.07s]  Does anyone remember
[733.07s -> 735.69s]  Those of you that were here the last time we did this
[738.00s -> 740.00s]  I streamed it in 60
[740.00s -> 742.00s]  To make sure we'd get the fast fucking movements
[742.00s -> 744.00s]  Right?
[744.00s -> 746.00s]  I didn't stream it in 30 last time
[746.00s -> 748.00s]  I shouldn't have to do that
[748.00s -> 765.50s]  I did 30, it was 30
[765.50s -> 768.76s]  What do you mean it was 30?
[768.76s -> 771.84s]  It was 30?
[771.84s -> 777.34s]  Don't fuck with me here
[777.34s -> 788.28s]  Wait, hold on
[788.28s -> 792.17s]  Hold on a second
[792.17s -> 799.60s]  Are you serious?
[799.60s -> 802.28s]  I gotta get to my computer
[802.28s -> 818.78s]  Wait
[818.78s -> 827.47s]  How is he blurry
[827.47s -> 831.74s]  Alright
[831.74s -> 834.43s]  Here's what I'm gonna do
[834.43s -> 836.43s]  We'll try this
[836.43s -> 838.60s]  I feel like I'm getting
[838.60s -> 842.00s]  Deja vu right now
[842.00s -> 844.00s]  Did I do this exact same thing
[844.00s -> 846.36s]  And go, oh this looks like shit
[846.36s -> 848.36s]  And then we did it in 1080 in 30
[848.36s -> 853.87s]  This is crazy?
[853.87s -> 855.87s]  This happened the last time
[855.87s -> 861.18s]  Is that what you're telling me?
[861.18s -> 863.18s]  It's in a twilight zone
[863.18s -> 872.33s]  I'll be right back
