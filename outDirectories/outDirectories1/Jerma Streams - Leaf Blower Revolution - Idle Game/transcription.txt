[0.70s -> 9.88s]  What's up? How you doing? Late? I know. Yeah, by five, by just five mini minutes, okay?
[11.22s -> 22.07s]  Five mini minutes. I think within five minutes is fine. Don't you agree? Look, they cancel your
[22.07s -> 27.11s]  doctor's appointment within 15, right? After 15. So if you get to your doctor's appointment
[27.91s -> 38.82s]  14 minutes late, they still take you. I'm here five. And then, hey, and then you gotta wait
[38.82s -> 53.13s]  40 for the doctor, right? You know what I mean? How you guys doing? I wanted to pop in. I know I
[53.13s -> 59.86s]  told you guys last week that the next few weeks are gonna be really tight, schedule-wise. A lot
[59.86s -> 64.18s]  of stuff going on. But I did not want to just disappear. I did want to hang out and have like
[64.18s -> 69.40s]  a chill stream and hang out with you guys for a while. You know, you've been calling me delay
[69.40s -> 75.88s]  Darryl, delay Danny the last few months. You're gonna have a new name for me. It's gonna be
[75.88s -> 83.42s]  Announcement Andrew. I'm gonna have like three things to talk about. I'm gonna be Announcement
[83.42s -> 100.17s]  Andy, like in a few weeks. Delay Dongus. Play Halo 3 with me. Like right now? You wanna play
[100.17s -> 109.91s]  Halo 3 with you right now? Not right now. No. Look, I don't wanna say no, but like I can't.
[110.63s -> 115.24s]  I don't even like, I don't play Halo. I can't, why am I responding to this?
[116.20s -> 125.26s]  No, I'm sorry. I'm not gonna play Halo 3 with you. Not right now. But look, just be honest. I'm
[125.26s -> 131.82s]  gonna be honest. I'm probably not gonna play Halo 3 with you. He's so high. No, I am not. I've just
[131.82s -> 143.22s]  got a T here. So today we're gonna do... Sorry. Today we're gonna do a couple of interesting
[143.22s -> 148.79s]  things. We're gonna play a game that I've been wanting to play. It's been on a bunch of polls
[148.79s -> 155.18s]  and it keeps getting vetoed. How dare that happen? We're gonna play Leaf Blower Revolution.
[155.18s -> 158.14s]  Just a chill game. We're gonna hang out. We're gonna see lots of resident sleepers tonight.
[158.14s -> 163.75s]  That's fine. God, that T was so hot. It's just like, it just like changed my voice.
[168.02s -> 171.86s]  But we're also gonna do something today that I've been kind of sitting in the back pocket
[171.86s -> 179.30s]  for a long time. We're gonna go over the Jerma Census that was taking place earlier this past
[179.30s -> 190.09s]  year. I'm not sure a lot of you've seen it. This is very interesting. Finally. Yeah. So we'll go
[190.09s -> 198.74s]  over that. It's pretty elaborate. The 2020... Yeah, we're gonna go over the 2020 census in 2021.
[198.74s -> 206.68s]  Come on, I'm a John Madden game. No, wait. It would be the reverse, wouldn't it? It would be
[206.68s -> 212.54s]  the 2021 census in 2021. Yeah, I fucked it up. It was the other way around. Reverse Madden.
[217.85s -> 220.97s]  Catboy waiting room. Yeah. Well, you're gonna have to just hold on.
[227.99s -> 232.87s]  Just let me do that the way that I want to do it. Please. Thank you. And thank you also. And thank
[232.87s -> 242.47s]  you. Please again. I did that as a joke to make like a funny slurp sound. And the T went underneath
[242.47s -> 249.67s]  my tongue and hit behind my back bottom teeth and hurt. This is so hot. And I thought that was so
[249.67s -> 254.07s]  funny though, right? It was so funny to go like... But the way that I moved my mouth, I just burnt
[254.07s -> 259.99s]  underneath my tongue behind my back teeth on the bottom. Nice. That was wicked funny though.
[259.99s -> 268.90s]  Everybody thought it was fucking funny. Everybody laughed at it. All right, let's go. Leafblower
[268.90s -> 276.14s]  simulator. I keep saying leaf blower simulator, but that's not what this is. Thank you Slimes for
[276.14s -> 281.35s]  the five community subs. You got Slime in your name. You are automatically a family member
[282.97s -> 291.34s]  in the Slime family. Not my family, in the Slime family. Which I mean, what is this,
[291.34s -> 300.57s]  Jerma? I told you I wanted to play this. I told you I wanted to play this. We went over
[300.57s -> 304.49s]  this like a million times. How many times have you guys been in the pre-stream chat and I was
[304.49s -> 308.01s]  like, I'm going to play leaf blower idle game. And people were like, oh man, don't play that.
[308.01s -> 313.38s]  That game sucks. And I'm like, I'm going to play it at one point. I'm going to play it.
[313.38s -> 321.96s]  This has happened like 10 times over the last two or three months. Hey, easy cash. Thanks for the
[321.96s -> 332.54s]  10 subs. Go get the Catboy dress. You're going to get the Catboy stream when I deem it necessary.
[332.54s -> 341.58s]  Okay. I can't wait for you guys to get so into this. You guys are going to, oh man,
[341.58s -> 345.66s]  it's a leaf blower game. This game's stupid. I don't even like leaf blowing. It's not even
[345.66s -> 351.94s]  the fall, Jeremy. Wait, what year is it? It's winter. It's not even the fall, Jeremy. It's
[351.94s -> 360.36s]  winter time. Why would there be leaves on the ground? Do it again. Ooh, all right.
[362.92s -> 371.83s]  I'm an engineer. That means I like guns. More guns. I've never seen that video in a long time.
[372.47s -> 384.50s]  All right. This is way too loud. Ha ha. NG joke. Band that guy for five minutes. All right. So
[384.50s -> 396.89s]  what do I do? Oh, you just have to get them off the screen? Do I have money? How is this leaf
[396.89s -> 401.61s]  blowing? I'm just sprinting and the wind that I'm making from running is getting rid of this.
[407.94s -> 416.76s]  This is epic. What is this thing? Gold leaves, trees. Okay. This music has to go. Can we put our
[416.76s -> 427.53s]  own music on? This is going to drive me crazy. This is going to drive me crazy. Sound effects,
[427.53s -> 438.04s]  volume, master volume. Wait. Alternative font. No. But on Doom? Hold on. I don't even hear any
[438.04s -> 450.76s]  sound effects. Where's the music? All right. I need to find the music button. Hard reset. Oh,
[450.76s -> 458.57s]  it's right here. What am I stupid? How do I drop it? All right. We need our own OST. I am so dumb.
[458.57s -> 465.67s]  All right. We need our own OST. Look, the leaves are getting out of control. Hold on. What should
[465.67s -> 478.31s]  I put on? How about the one that goes? The Flintstones. Pushing away leaves with your
[478.31s -> 485.53s]  bare hands is so much fun. Okay. I get a rake for 50 leaf dollars. Get a rake. Pushing away leaves
[485.53s -> 495.75s]  with a rake. Guess you're doing it wrong. Oh, shit. This is perfect. Big bang theory OST. You
[495.75s -> 502.09s]  want to try to get me banned from this website? Wait, that made sounds. How do we get one sound
[502.09s -> 521.27s]  effect? That was it? I just get one sound effect. This is epic. Just wait. Just wait until the huge
[521.27s -> 529.53s]  crazy dark twist happens. I don't want to tell you guys about it, but man, you guys have no idea.
[529.53s -> 537.02s]  It's like a leaf blower again. No, there are bodies buried here. There are bodies buried here,
[537.02s -> 541.58s]  and slowly as he cleans up the leaves, some of the bodies are going to get exposed,
[541.58s -> 545.42s]  and there's going to be skeletons and dead decomposing bodies and coffins and shit in here,
[545.42s -> 550.50s]  and this is a guy's backyard and he's a fucking serial killer. There you go. You play the game
[550.50s -> 559.61s]  now? You spoiled it. All right. I need an OST. Give me something. I'm going to beat this whole
[559.61s -> 574.02s]  game on stream, by the way. I'm on Doom 1. Turn it off. Bet on what? Put on Final Fantasy. How
[574.02s -> 589.26s]  about Silent Hill? Okay, I'm into that. Let's put on Silent Hill OST. That changes this whole
[589.26s -> 606.98s]  thing. This makes this like a scary game. Let's go. I'm getting overwhelmed by leaves here.
[607.54s -> 619.08s]  I have $600. Hold on. I have $600 bucks. A $500 rake? Large rake. Better, but still feels wrong.
[619.72s -> 634.22s]  That feels pretty clean. I like it. I like it. How do I make the leaves produce more trees?
[634.70s -> 639.02s]  How do I make the trees drop more leaves on the ground for me to rake? That's important.
[639.66s -> 651.99s]  Come on, I need more money. Gold leaves. Trees can drop 10,000. Spawns one more leaf per tree each
[651.99s -> 659.34s]  step. Oh yeah, let's go. I'm making trees. I'm actually spawning trees around. This game is
[659.34s -> 673.98s]  fucking crazy. I like that. That feels pretty good. Yes, I am very well aware that this looks like
[674.46s -> 684.38s]  one of those mobile on your iPhone ads where the ad forces you to play the game for five
[684.38s -> 696.09s]  seconds before you're allowed to hit the X in the corner. It's always really laggy too.
[696.73s -> 702.81s]  How do they even do that? Why do they even do that? All right, I got $500 bucks. Wait,
[702.81s -> 712.68s]  I got a trophy. So many leaves. That's one Golden Emerald claim. How many Golden Emeralds do I have?
[713.40s -> 723.88s]  I just got another one. Fruits. Wait, that you can get fruits and stuff?
[725.03s -> 728.95s]  Time played. The longer you play, the more achievements you get. Simple progress.
[730.55s -> 743.26s]  Playing that. How many minutes is that? It's an actual phone game. Yeah, I'm kind of having fun.
[743.26s -> 749.38s]  I like this. I've been waiting to play this game for months. I've been trying to find the opportunity
[749.38s -> 756.89s]  where I can put it in there. Leaves drop faster. 5% faster. All right, the leaves are dropping 10%
[756.89s -> 768.22s]  faster. I love it. I got to get a good strategy here. Up and down, up and down. That was a fruit.
[768.22s -> 772.12s]  That was one apple. I was waiting to play this. Yeah, this is like my most anticipated game of
[772.12s -> 777.62s]  the entire year besides Hitman 3, which comes out in like fucking eight days. So we're going to be
[777.62s -> 789.54s]  playing that. Is that me? All right, can you believe? I got to give some praise here. You
[789.54s -> 797.24s]  want to talk about video game companies? Here we go. How happy are you guys that IO Interactive
[797.24s -> 803.10s]  bought their assets out of Square Enix? And we're like, fuck this. We're buying ourselves out and
[803.10s -> 813.75s]  we're going to go independent. That means we got to get Hitman, the new one, and Hitman 2,
[813.75s -> 816.63s]  and now Hitman 3. And they've been coming out like every two years and they're fantastic.
[816.63s -> 822.04s]  Just so much fun. Let me give like some claps in the chat here for like IO Interactive and the
[822.04s -> 824.84s]  fact that like they're pumping out these fucking awesome games like once every like two, three
[824.84s -> 833.67s]  years. It's insane that they're able to do that. I got a thousand. What should I do? Leaf marketing?
[835.48s -> 846.15s]  No, I want to do more trees. Why is there somebody just hitting like pans or something? What is that?
[846.23s -> 860.57s]  All right, I'm out. It's Pyramid Head. You guys know that I played Silent Hill 1 when it first
[860.57s -> 867.93s]  came out and I thought the game was dog shit because I didn't get it. I thought the game was
[867.93s -> 877.18s]  terrible. I was young. I look, it wasn't like it wasn't fun for me. It was just like, this is stupid.
[877.18s -> 884.79s]  I hate this. I've walked around in like a bunch of like steam and I couldn't find the like diner or
[884.79s -> 891.24s]  whatever. And I was surrounded by mist. I was like, this game sucks. And I never played it again
[891.24s -> 902.54s]  until I was like 30. Leaf marketing, you dingus. Hold on. I want to get over 2000.
[906.97s -> 911.05s]  I really don't like this OST. It's too, I don't like it for right now. I feel like I'm playing,
[911.05s -> 919.70s]  I feel like it's like Halloween. And you guys feel like this is Halloween right now? I need like a,
[920.42s -> 932.41s]  a January soundtrack. This is October. Here we go. That's a good technique. Feels good.
[932.41s -> 939.59s]  Fucking satisfying. Reddit. All right, wait, wait, wait, hold on. Well, I need 10k. Fertilizer?
[940.31s -> 954.81s]  Nuclear fuel? Holy shit. I'm already going nuclear. That just turned off really fast and
[954.81s -> 963.70s]  fucking freaked me out. What's going on? I don't like that. Get a leaf blower, you idiot. Hold on.
[966.50s -> 977.75s]  Get a leaf blower. 5k. I need 5k. I don't even, I need $5,000. Look at that blowing power. This is
[977.75s -> 984.78s]  perfect. Oh, I love it. The apples are worth, okay. What are the apples worth? 200? That's it. Wait,
[984.78s -> 992.60s]  we got achievement. Fruits. What does that currency do? It's claim all, whatever. What's,
[992.60s -> 999.14s]  what's the apple currency? Okay. Plus one apple. What does it do? There are 10,000 people watching
[999.14s -> 1006.94s]  this man clean up leaves. Yeah, that's it. Look, it's the experience. Right now you probably looked
[1006.94s -> 1011.35s]  outside and you were like, yeah, I still haven't done it. There are probably like a bunch of old
[1011.35s -> 1019.27s]  leaves on the ground that you didn't do since like November. And you just shut the window closed and
[1019.27s -> 1028.31s]  you go, nah, I'll just watch him do it instead. Break your leaves all the way into January. What
[1028.39s -> 1043.75s]  would even happen? The snow, it just decomposed. Oh, that would be bad. There's snow on the ground.
[1045.03s -> 1050.81s]  But don't you understand? I've wanted to play this game since like September or October of this past
[1050.81s -> 1057.64s]  year. Why would I have wanted to play leaf blowing simulator now? No, I'm catching up with what I
[1057.64s -> 1063.06s]  wanted to do four months ago. Otherwise, what? I got to wait a whole, I got to wait another year
[1063.06s -> 1069.51s]  to play this. No, you're going to do it. You're going to sit down and you're going to listen to
[1069.51s -> 1076.30s]  me play this game. And hold on, I got to get this off. This OST. This OST is making me nuts.
[1076.30s -> 1088.76s]  Make me crazy. I got to turn this off. Let's skip halfway in. No, I don't like this. I want
[1088.76s -> 1096.09s]  something else. Give me something else. This is too much for me. I don't want to have like
[1096.09s -> 1104.55s]  pyramid head chasing you down a hallway for an hour and a half. I don't know. Put on herbs?
[1105.96s -> 1123.86s]  URB herbs? What's herbs? Hotline Miami? That's a good one. I'll do that one. Yep. Oh yeah. Yeah,
[1123.86s -> 1130.30s]  this is like a 9.4. One reason why it's not a 10 is because I fucking hated every second of this
[1130.30s -> 1139.62s]  game. Wait, no, no, no. No, Hotline Miami 2 is the one, right? Look at that. Look at that. Look at
[1139.62s -> 1145.85s]  that. Look at that. Look at that. No, Hotline Miami 2 is the one that I didn't like. I liked
[1145.85s -> 1151.46s]  Hotline Miami 1. I liked Hotline Miami 2 though. I just hated it. You guys get it. We're all gamers
[1151.46s -> 1159.16s]  here. All right. Let's get more trees. Yeah. No, I was supposed to get a leaf blower. Whatever. I
[1159.16s -> 1173.69s]  got plenty of time. Oh, it feels so good. It feels like I'm just like shaving. You guys ever shave
[1174.25s -> 1178.73s]  in the mirror and you have a ton of hair and you get that one clean line and you just go,
[1178.73s -> 1192.49s]  oh, you know. None of you guys have ever shaved before? You don't know what it's like to get like
[1192.49s -> 1202.01s]  the clean line of like a... Oh, but I don't understand. I don't shave. I let it grow.
[1202.01s -> 1212.54s]  Maybe you have to have shaved at least once in your life. I'm 12. We're 12. No, you're not. You
[1212.54s -> 1217.74s]  know why I know that? Because I've got the goddamn census right in front of me. You're 12. Are you?
[1217.74s -> 1221.90s]  Well, that's interesting. We'll find out because I've got the census in front of me. I can see
[1221.90s -> 1237.35s]  exactly how old you are. I got to get a 5k. We lied on the census. That's illegal. So no, you didn't
[1238.07s -> 1252.76s]  prove it. But is that not illegal? I mean, it's illegal. Are there people that like take the
[1252.76s -> 1265.05s]  census and say that like 400 people live in their house? That's illegal. Do you go to jail for that?
[1267.40s -> 1273.83s]  I don't think you're a court date. The judge is proceeding. Now, Mr. Albertson says here
[1274.55s -> 1280.23s]  that you are said on your census that 250,000 people lived in your residence. Is that correct?
[1280.87s -> 1288.12s]  That's correct, your honor. Now, why did you think that was so funny to mess with the census?
[1289.43s -> 1297.46s]  Very important thing, the census. We need to keep track of all kinds. You know what that does? You
[1297.46s -> 1300.74s]  know, that makes us so we can determine where the tax dollars go. That's what it's for.
[1301.62s -> 1305.54s]  I'm sorry. I'll never do it again. That's right. You'll never do it again
[1306.10s -> 1312.20s]  because you're going to spend 24 months in prison. I'm sorry, doctor. I'm sorry,
[1312.20s -> 1325.67s]  Dr. Phil. I'll never do it again. That's right. Adjourned. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, guys, guys,
[1325.67s -> 1330.87s]  guys, guarantee you. He's a 100% guarantee. Dr. Phil is going to have a Judge Judy show eventually
[1330.87s -> 1336.97s]  when he doesn't feel like doing the Dr. Phil show anymore. There will be a Dr. Phil has the big
[1337.69s -> 1344.23s]  Judge Robon show. Now you, now you tell me. Now you, you're going to get that. Now you,
[1344.23s -> 1361.96s]  you'll hear it 100 times an episode. The court of Phil. He's going to do it. I'm telling you,
[1361.96s -> 1367.02s]  he's going to do that. It's okay. I'll just be right. That's fine. Just wait for the battleship
[1367.02s -> 1371.50s]  meta to take over Twitch. Just wait and then come to me and tell me that I was wrong. I'm
[1371.50s -> 1379.78s]  waiting for you to tell me I was wrong. When you get like the people freaking out at each other
[1379.78s -> 1385.06s]  and like bunch of like threads about like the fucking battleship drama, you come to me and
[1385.06s -> 1401.11s]  tell me I was wrong. I want you to do it. Just give me six months. Wait, what happened? Oh shit,
[1401.11s -> 1407.06s]  we had a fucking raid. We had like a couple of braids. Kit Boga comes in with a raid. What's
[1407.06s -> 1420.47s]  going on, Kit? Kit Boga, resident funny man on the internet. Go follow Kit Boga if you haven't. He's
[1420.47s -> 1427.19s]  got one of the best streams on Twitch. Guaranteed by the way. That's a German 985 guarantee. Hope
[1427.19s -> 1435.56s]  you had a good stream. Hope you had a good new year too. That means nothing. Wait, what?
[1438.44s -> 1444.22s]  Hold on. The German 985 guarantee means nothing? Yeah, it doesn't at all.
[1447.16s -> 1452.47s]  Oh, you got to get the leaf blower. Hold on. Let me get the leaf blower. Leaf blower. This is fun.
[1452.47s -> 1464.52s]  Oh man. Look at this. Oh man. I need extra spawning. Oh, thanks for the, thanks for the raid.
[1464.52s -> 1468.42s]  Welcome guys. We're playing leaf blower simulator. That's not the name. The game is called leaf
[1468.42s -> 1475.14s]  blower revolution. We're just chilling today. I'm just having a chill stream. You know, nothing
[1475.14s -> 1480.63s]  weird is going to happen today. This is just leaf blowing, collecting apples and just hanging out
[1480.63s -> 1488.38s]  with you. Thanks for being here. We had another raid too. We had nice beaver. A few hundred people
[1488.38s -> 1503.18s]  came in from nice beaver. Thanks for the raid. Where's the cat boy? Hope you had a good stream.
[1503.18s -> 1510.81s]  3000 people are gone. That's all you guys know how to raid works? All right. Let me ask you a
[1510.81s -> 1517.66s]  question. Everyone's saying 3k people left. Let me ask you a question. So when we raid somebody,
[1517.66s -> 1523.88s]  here we go. Here comes the census. When we raid somebody, how long do you stay there for
[1523.88s -> 1534.81s]  after the raid? Tell me. Five minutes, 10 minutes, an hour, few hours. No one's obligated to stay here
[1534.81s -> 1542.76s]  and watch me. They just consumed probably an awesome kit bogus stream. You know, maybe you got
[1542.76s -> 1546.92s]  to get stuff to do. You come in and say hello, jump into another stream and raid, and then you
[1546.92s -> 1564.36s]  got stuff to do. You're like, all right, I'm going to take a break. Yummy stream. Hey, Seb,
[1564.36s -> 1571.86s]  Seb Burrito, thanks for the five subs, community subs. Thank you, Seb. How long is this song?
[1572.50s -> 1584.34s]  Is this like the 10 hour version of the first song? There we go. All right. There we go. I
[1584.34s -> 1589.35s]  feel like I'm playing Hotline Miami. Don't you think so? Can you imagine like three guys coming
[1589.43s -> 1601.74s]  down here and it's like, next area. Hotline Miami is such a weird game. I always feel like I want
[1601.74s -> 1608.09s]  to play it again because it's so much fun to play it. But I've gone back to it once or twice, I think,
[1609.50s -> 1612.46s]  and you just instantly die like five times in a row in the first few levels. And you're like,
[1612.46s -> 1627.64s]  no, I forgot. I don't want to do this ever again. Do a freestyle rap. All right. Okay.
[1628.84s -> 1637.58s]  The leaves have fallen. It's time for fall. It's having a ball. I'm off the wall. I'm seeing you.
[1637.58s -> 1644.06s]  I'm seeing you with my two eyes burning you through those, those, uh, those thighs and then,
[1644.06s -> 1666.23s]  uh, whatever. That was fucking awful. No, what do you want me to say? I try to find a word.
[1666.23s -> 1686.44s]  Don't ever do that again. All right. Upgrades 500. Wait, where's my golden leaves? Wait, what?
[1687.00s -> 1695.14s]  Where's the golden leaf currency? Holy shit, there's so much. All right. Where's the golden
[1695.14s -> 1704.23s]  leaf? Trees can drop golden leaves. I need 10,000. One leaf per level. This is expensive.
[1704.87s -> 1709.83s]  One leaf per level by using advanced marketing techniques. Holy shit. That's two. That's plus
[1709.83s -> 1729.82s]  two. That's plus two. That's all plus two. I need more spawn. I need more spawn. More spawn. More.
[1735.06s -> 1737.94s]  Bye bye. More marketing. All right. I'm going to save it for marketing free.
[1737.94s -> 1749.99s]  I need to take a sip since I burnt my mouth. There we go. Here's the ultimate test for all
[1749.99s -> 1753.11s]  you guys said that you would sit here and watch me like paint a fence or something.
[1755.18s -> 1760.38s]  I mean, you're struggling right now. Hovering over the X button. Just trying to find a reason to leave
[1761.10s -> 1765.74s]  that you said in chat a year ago. I would watch you paint a fence. I would watch you do anything.
[1765.74s -> 1770.87s]  I would watch you just sit and stare at a wall, would you? Hovering over the fucking X button.
[1770.87s -> 1777.05s]  Remembering the promise you made to me. Are you going to keep your promise? Or are you going to
[1777.05s -> 1785.62s]  be a liar? We'll find out. We'll find out if you actually did what you said you were going to do.
[1786.18s -> 1795.94s]  I'm just really glad that you heard. Ah, they clicked it. They clicked it.
[1796.90s -> 1809.88s]  How much is it? Uh, two. All right. It's 12,000. Should I just go? I'm going to do it again.
[1817.10s -> 1821.02s]  Will you succumb to the boredom? Will you succumb to it? Or will you click that X?
[1821.90s -> 1828.14s]  You won't click that X. You won't click that X. You won't click that X. No, no, no, no. Wait.
[1828.14s -> 1832.46s]  There's a Jedi mind trick. They tell you to do it and you don't do it. You will click that X. No,
[1832.46s -> 1835.82s]  don't click it though. Does that work on you? What's the Jedi mind trick one? You wave your
[1835.82s -> 1843.24s]  hand around and you say it, right? You will. You will shoot me in the chest.
[1844.20s -> 1868.65s]  Shooting in chest. Roger. Force gas light. Oh no, not a robot chicken joke.
[1868.65s -> 1876.50s]  Obi-Wan's at the fucking grocery store and like his coupon expired. Sorry, Mr. Kenobi,
[1876.50s -> 1882.42s]  this coupon expired. You will give me another day on that 25% off laundry detergent coupon.
[1883.51s -> 1900.90s]  I will give you that 25% coupon. Yes. Oh no, he'd probably go, Jedi mind trick. Yes.
[1901.86s -> 1920.52s]  Damn that guy. Me? How come every robot chicken reference that we've ever made has been about
[1920.52s -> 1926.81s]  a Star Wars routine that they do. Probably because that's what they do. It's either like
[1926.81s -> 1933.06s]  Thundercats, Star Wars, or like the Hulk. It's like every single joke they've ever made.
[1933.78s -> 1945.80s]  How does Mike? What? What did I say? It's whatever action figure they can get on sale.
[1946.84s -> 1954.01s]  All right. I need 12k, right? I need to buy any more leaves. This is bullshit.
[1960.97s -> 1974.50s]  You cracked the code after 15 years. Family Guy, Star Wars. Hey, you guys, you guys still make,
[1974.50s -> 1981.08s]  you guys make Peter Griffin references all the time. I'm not sure what's happening with Family
[1981.08s -> 1986.90s]  Guy right now, but so Family Guy is like not funny anymore, right? Like I don't think it is,
[1987.86s -> 1995.11s]  but people, it like, it was funny for like five or six seasons and then it got like canned. They
[1995.11s -> 1999.91s]  brought it back. It was all right for a while and then everybody hated it and now nobody cares about
[1999.91s -> 2008.18s]  the show. They just like to meme the characters on the show. Like I see Peter Griffin fucking
[2008.18s -> 2014.68s]  everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, but you don't, nobody watches that show. I've seen like the holy
[2014.68s -> 2019.80s]  crap lowest like people are using Peter Griffin and like Stewie and stuff, but the show doesn't
[2019.80s -> 2036.44s]  even matter to them. It's weird, isn't it? Yeah. He's doing what? You are describing yourself.
[2038.09s -> 2049.22s]  Yeah. Of what? So are you sure? But people like, all right, but wait a minute. Is this a scenario?
[2049.22s -> 2052.98s]  Okay. Are you telling me to like put milk up my nose in the cafeteria? Not because you like want
[2052.98s -> 2056.18s]  to watch me put milk up my nose, but you think I'm going to do it and it's funny that I will
[2056.18s -> 2059.70s]  actually put the milk up my nose. You don't actually care that I'm doing the milk up the
[2059.70s -> 2062.26s]  nose. You just know that I'm going to do it and I'm going to be like, holy shit, the guy put
[2062.26s -> 2066.58s]  fucking milk up his nose. You don't actually care about the milk going into my nose. You just like,
[2066.82s -> 2081.80s]  shocked that I'm going to do it in the first place. Really? Okay. Excuses.
[2085.46s -> 2091.67s]  All right. I need 12,000 and then I'm going to move on to a new weapon. Catboy stream. You need
[2091.67s -> 2097.43s]  to lap up milk. Let me tell you something. If you think for a second that it's just going to be me
[2097.43s -> 2103.64s]  with fucking cat ears on, if you think I'm just going to have cat ears on and like eye makeup on,
[2103.64s -> 2113.83s]  you are so wrong. It's insulting. Just wait. Just you wait. You'll see.
[2122.06s -> 2137.66s]  All right. 12,000. I'm almost there. Maybe I should try horizontal. Yep. That's cleaner to me,
[2137.66s -> 2144.73s]  I think. What do you think? Is that cleaner to you? All right. 12,000. Here we go.
[2146.09s -> 2150.89s]  Leaf marketing level three. Oh, that's a lot of money. All right. Now I have plus four. Let's go.
[2150.89s -> 2155.74s]  Now I'm going to get the leaves spawning here. How much is that? I need golden leaves to spawn.
[2158.81s -> 2173.74s]  50 subs if you drink milk out of your nose. No, I'm not like 10. Okay. No, I don't want to do that.
[2173.74s -> 2187.00s]  I'm not going to drink milk through my nose. No, that's not happening. I'm sorry. If you think
[2187.00s -> 2192.81s]  you're going to get a guy drinking milk out of his nose today. No, I'd rather piss my pants on stream.
[2195.40s -> 2198.76s]  If you have that on the scale of things you would embarrassing things, oh my God,
[2198.76s -> 2203.29s]  of things you'd that, oh, but look at how crazy that was. That much hurt. I would rather stand up
[2203.93s -> 2208.41s]  and just pee into a pair of jeans than snort milk in my nose on stream.
[2209.91s -> 2224.71s]  I'm serious. I really mean that. Two billion off the debt. Yeah, there won't be a debt anymore.
[2224.71s -> 2234.17s]  Won't be a channel anymore. Hey, if I get like permanently banned on Twitch, that means like
[2234.17s -> 2243.19s]  the debt goes away too, right? Like I can't pay it back. I'm going to like streamer prison. I mean,
[2243.19s -> 2252.78s]  no. If I go to like streamer, like banned streamer Twitch prison, how am I going to pay you back?
[2252.78s -> 2258.92s]  I'm literally in prison. What are you talking about? We will find you. Yeah, I'm in prison. You
[2258.92s -> 2265.14s]  can come like visit and I'll pick the phone up and you pick the phone up and you can just say like,
[2265.14s -> 2274.79s]  hell you well, I had you made it and hang up. Like I don't have to pay you. Oh, that was a good line
[2274.79s -> 2284.73s]  right there. All right. Let's go. I got to claim some of this stuff. What do we got? Healthy fruits.
[2288.20s -> 2292.65s]  Uh, I, I don't, I want to hit claim all, but I want to see what I'm getting. You guys like that?
[2292.65s -> 2304.94s]  Oh, whatever. All right. I need 500 golden leaves. Freeze can drop gold leaves. Oh,
[2304.94s -> 2313.75s]  now I have that currency shit. Okay. How often does it drop? Not, not that often. Can I make
[2313.75s -> 2321.24s]  them spawn faster? Exchange? I didn't read it. So this is a huge spam and I missed it. I don't know
[2321.24s -> 2328.97s]  what I said. This is your lawyer speaking. I need you to whatever it says. Hi. This is your lawyer
[2328.97s -> 2333.13s]  speaking. I need you to pay me the fee and kisses this time. I saw your stream on Thursday and it's
[2333.13s -> 2350.60s]  being deleted. So I'm not going to read it. It's being deleted as fast as I can read it.
[2350.68s -> 2372.01s]  That's so funny. No. New upgrade menu. Where? Oh my God. There's a new upgrade menu. Platinum
[2372.01s -> 2379.86s]  leaves. Holy shit. I'm going to be here all day. We're going to go through like four OSTs today,
[2379.86s -> 2393.51s]  guys. I can't wait. Poggers. Pog. Poggers. Poggers. Poggers. Poggers. Poggers. There it is.
[2393.51s -> 2405.40s]  Does Chuck E. Cheese even still stream? Or did he do that for like a week when Fall Guys was popular?
[2405.40s -> 2426.44s]  He quit because of you. All right. New OST. What do we got? Let's see some. Okay. I can do
[2427.00s -> 2440.71s]  spawns more leaves. Oh, wait. But hold on. What is this? I got to max this out, right? Fertilizer.
[2440.71s -> 2455.35s]  Dust Force? Nah. Nah. Maybe. Doom Eternal. No, we always go to Doom. No more Doom. Something else.
[2455.35s -> 2473.06s]  Smite OST. Auto leaf blower and automatic leaf blower. What is that? Oh shit. This is where the
[2473.06s -> 2482.82s]  game starts to play itself. Perfect. The little Roombas. Oh, that's so cute. I love them. Wait,
[2482.82s -> 2503.38s]  why are they out of batteries? Are you serious? Stardew Valley. How about Pokemon Mystery Dungeon?
[2503.38s -> 2521.78s]  I'll do Earthbound for a little while. Who doesn't love the Earthbound OST? I want Toe Jam Eternal.
[2521.78s -> 2537.54s]  Just because I want to hear the... Yeah, there it is. Am I delayed by like fucking a thousand seconds?
[2537.54s -> 2544.82s]  No.
[2547.78s -> 2558.71s]  Burp. Dude, I gotta tell you guys something. I watched my new favorite YouTube video.
[2559.43s -> 2568.25s]  It's this guy. It's this guy, Badlands Chucks. You ever heard of Badlands Booker? I love this guy,
[2568.25s -> 2577.19s]  by the way. He slams like sodas. He usually competes in the Coney Island hot dog eating
[2577.19s -> 2588.22s]  competition. I love this guy's channel. I love him. He gets like a bunch of sodas and Gatorades.
[2588.22s -> 2594.06s]  Yeah, enough talk. I love this guy. It's like a new favorite channel. He has a video
[2594.94s -> 2600.62s]  where he burps so fucking loud and so long it's almost like it's not even real.
[2601.42s -> 2614.71s]  It's been dubbed over, but it's not. You have to play that video. We will. Hold on. It's insane.
[2617.35s -> 2622.71s]  You would love that. I love this guy. He seems like a nice guy, too.
[2628.12s -> 2631.08s]  He like scream burps into the camera and it just kills me.
[2637.37s -> 2647.46s]  But he has a bunch of world records for like eating and drinking and stuff. I'm on a Badlands
[2647.46s -> 2661.70s]  Chucks kick right now. I'll tell you. Play it. Hold on. It just comes out. I love it. It's just
[2661.70s -> 2675.86s]  ridiculous. Longest and loudest burp video ever created. You better not because this channel is
[2675.86s -> 2692.63s]  perfect. Hold on. I'll get it. Show it. Show it. Hold on. I'm working on it. Disney Plus, Hulu,
[2692.63s -> 2702.71s]  and ESPN. Don't listen to that. Some characters. The largest streaming TV library. Stop. I don't
[2702.71s -> 2712.20s]  want to hear it. Skip that ad. All right. We'll just get to the part. He's drinking a like a
[2712.20s -> 2724.50s]  two liter of soda. We'll get to the part where he does it. It's ridiculous. Can you see it?
[2727.51s -> 2732.78s]  This is the most ridiculous video I've ever seen. You guys ready? All right. Let's go. Three, two,
[2732.78s -> 2745.86s]  one. This is currently the best channel on YouTube, by the way. We're going to make that clear.
[2759.62s -> 2769.14s]  It's so hard to do this. I think this is like an old video of his, too. Here it comes. Here it
[2769.14s -> 2788.76s]  comes. Here it comes. I turn your volume down. I'm serious. I can't do it. It's so insane.
[2792.68s -> 2803.05s]  Oh, it's the best. It's still going. Okay. All right. It's the best video on YouTube by far.
[2803.61s -> 2824.94s]  It's Badlands Chugs. Go follow Badlands Chugs. Put it at half speed. Do that on stream? You serious?
[2825.88s -> 2837.45s]  No, these guys are like trained professionals. He has world records. I don't know. I can't do that.
[2837.45s -> 2847.77s]  I don't have a world record. That's the sample from a dubstep. Oh, it's so loud and just so
[2847.77s -> 2861.43s]  powerful. It really is like a it's like a war cry. I got 75 golds. There we go. You're dead
[2861.43s -> 2884.89s]  as a world record. Yeah, I know. 80. All right. We got some we're upgrading to do here. Link.
[2884.89s -> 2896.09s]  Look at this link. What link? No, no links right now. Look, look, look, look. Hold on. Wait,
[2896.09s -> 2901.19s]  wait, wait, wait, wait. I can't even click it. Pee your pants right now. No, I'm not going to
[2901.19s -> 2911.05s]  pee my pants right now. I'm busy. How about more trees and more fertilizer? Yeah. Yep.
[2912.57s -> 2935.91s]  Here's another one. No, let me get to like at least $100,000 and I'll click it. This one,
[2935.99s -> 2941.27s]  please, please. Are you kidding me? You're useless. Well, I click the link. I click the link.
[2949.85s -> 2963.11s]  No, no, thanks. That's not good enough. What do I owe? I still owe like just around $4 billion.
[2963.83s -> 2967.27s]  That's got to be at least a 75% wipe. All right, that's not happening.
[2976.71s -> 2982.92s]  Haven't people already done that too? I know of at least like three or four like to at least two
[2982.92s -> 2990.65s]  or three streamers that have done exactly what you were describing. RT did that like very recently
[2990.65s -> 3006.47s]  like a month or two ago. I love this game. He dated chat for free. Well, that's the difference
[3006.47s -> 3011.66s]  between him and I. That's the difference between him and I. You're not going to get anything for
[3011.66s -> 3028.31s]  free here. Everything has a cost. Everything has a cost. It's implying that you're good at it.
[3028.31s -> 3041.50s]  What if you're good at something? Never do it. I need more leaves. This is not enough. I need
[3041.50s -> 3050.90s]  more leaves. Not enough. Nuclear fuel. No. Can I spend some of the gold leaves? How much? It's
[3050.90s -> 3055.83s]  500 for the next tool, right? Can I just save up for the next tool? No, no, no. I need more leaves.
[3055.83s -> 3061.03s]  No, fuck that. Unlock the leaf portal. You can restart your leaf blowing to gain coins. What?
[3061.67s -> 3075.77s]  Is this prestiging? Spawns one more leaf per tree. Yeah, let's go. Look at that. It's filling the
[3075.77s -> 3084.06s]  screen now. Remember, you idiot, the devs in the chat and you missed it. Were they?
[3084.78s -> 3097.22s]  Are they still here? Look at the chat. I didn't see. Where? Is it a bait? It might be. I don't
[3097.22s -> 3107.90s]  know. I don't know. It might be a bait. Behind you. I look behind me. Hey, man. Hey, what's up? Hey,
[3107.90s -> 3117.80s]  you playing my game? The thing is though, anybody could just say that. I could just be like a crazed
[3117.80s -> 3127.62s]  person. That could still be somebody pretending to be a dev. The whole dev in chat thing, we need
[3127.62s -> 3137.32s]  some form of dev ID, don't we? Twitch should implement a feature where they have another badge.
[3137.32s -> 3141.08s]  If they're actually the game dev and they can prove it, when their game is being played from
[3141.08s -> 3146.12s]  the directory, they should pop up and chat with a dev badge. Why is that not here, Twitch? Why have
[3146.12s -> 3159.05s]  you not implemented that? Why is that not a thing you have here? You just put me in a clown costume.
[3159.05s -> 3163.13s]  I'll get in there to a Twitch meeting and I'll give them all these things. I want a percentage
[3163.13s -> 3177.46s]  though. It's not for free. It never was. And I make sure I say that in the boardroom. And then they
[3177.46s -> 3182.50s]  say, Mr. Albertson, you're not getting any, a fraction of any of these royalties. Okay, that's
[3182.50s -> 3186.90s]  fine. That's cool. Cool, man. That's cool. Hey, man. Just give me a call if I can do anything, okay?
[3188.31s -> 3195.61s]  Just give me a call. I'll be around. You can use any of those. Just use them. You can use any of
[3195.61s -> 3201.11s]  them. All right, cool. Yep. See you. Thanks for having me. Thanks for having me. Yeah, call me
[3201.11s -> 3207.64s]  again if you need me for anything. If you just want to hang out. I'll be around. I don't live
[3207.64s -> 3213.51s]  here, but I could be here. I could be here. Just let me know. Then I'll honk the nose like three
[3213.51s -> 3232.01s]  times and they will never call me again. In fact, the door will lock behind me. The door will lock
[3232.01s -> 3238.63s]  behind me and then I will have forgotten something in the boardroom. And I have to stand there and I
[3238.63s -> 3246.52s]  have to text somebody that's still in there. Hey, I left my jacket in there. And then they all have
[3246.52s -> 3252.86s]  to go, fuck, he's going to hear the door unlock sound. It's not just, oh, yeah, open. Here we are.
[3252.86s -> 3258.57s]  He's going to sit. He's right there and he's going to hear chunk chunk. And he's going to know that
[3258.57s -> 3275.91s]  we locked the fucking door. Grab my jacket. Toe Jamming Girl is a great soundtrack. I didn't even
[3275.91s -> 3283.37s]  think about that. All right, I got money. Where's it going? Freeze. More of them. And a third auto
[3283.37s -> 3303.34s]  leaf blower. Is this a Family Guy skit? I hope not. It is. No, it is not. It's not. That's not.
[3303.34s -> 3311.29s]  Not. You know, we're going to get to a real weird part of like human history here in the next couple
[3311.29s -> 3316.94s]  hundred years when like every conceivable thing that's ever been said, every conceivable joke,
[3316.94s -> 3323.19s]  every piece of music, every combination of sounds have been done. What happens in like two or three
[3323.19s -> 3336.38s]  hundred years? It's never going to happen. Are you sure? I might. What happens when every possible
[3336.38s -> 3346.68s]  joke can be made and every possible song is written? Every movie's ever been made? How do
[3346.68s -> 3354.46s]  we entertain ourselves? I think we're going back to the gladiator times when every piece of music
[3354.46s -> 3357.42s]  has ever been written and nothing else can be written again in like a thousand years. We're
[3357.42s -> 3373.58s]  going back into like we're going back to the gladiator pits. Just listen to old stuff. Yeah,
[3373.58s -> 3385.94s]  you could. Or you could watch the new like UFC card, UFC 1600, where they just give two guys
[3385.94s -> 3405.38s]  two rakes and and they add like lightsaber sounds over the footage, like live. And there'll be like
[3405.38s -> 3413.62s]  two or three ads for like fucking like the new Spongebob movie. That's what we're looking at.
[3413.62s -> 3427.05s]  Jeremy, you always reuse jokes. We're used to it already. All right. Yeah, but I made them up.
[3427.05s -> 3432.41s]  But I made them up. I made them up. You know how difficult it was and how hard it was to sit there
[3432.41s -> 3441.32s]  and have writers block and craft over and over again in my head? Well, what would that be? Like
[3441.32s -> 3445.32s]  it was there was so much thought that went into that. It was I had to sit there and write down
[3445.32s -> 3464.49s]  hundreds of pages of scripture. I need five hundred leaves. I need more. I need more. That's
[3464.49s -> 3469.88s]  the I'm trying to yell, but I'm not trying to actually yell loud, like pretend yelling. I hate
[3469.88s -> 3478.33s]  that. I'm not doing that anymore. You'll never hear that again from me. I promise. Stop pretending.
[3478.33s -> 3487.90s]  Look at how many leaves are on screen, though. You guys didn't like this game. How dare you?
[3487.90s -> 3497.64s]  More leaves, more. Prestige already. Should I, though? Leaf portal is 300. Um, gained coins.
[3497.64s -> 3510.52s]  But what what do you mean coins? I don't know what that means. Is this the whole game? Um,
[3510.52s -> 3514.78s]  for the most part, yeah, you just just chill and just blow leaves and stuff, man.
[3514.78s -> 3520.87s]  Well, this is going to be just a chill stream or just talk to you guys and hang out with you.
[3520.87s -> 3524.07s]  Why don't you? I've asked you guys a bunch of questions. Why don't you ask me a few questions?
[3524.07s -> 3531.34s]  What do you think? Any questions for me? I will answer anything. Let's go. What do you have? Any
[3531.34s -> 3540.07s]  questions? Old to you. Thirty five. Next one, please. What are the announcements? The announcements
[3540.07s -> 3551.43s]  of three different projects that are going to be shown and seen very soon. Two of them will be in
[3551.43s -> 3559.32s]  the month of February. One of them will probably be in April or March or April. We'll see. Are you
[3559.32s -> 3576.23s]  the Zodiac Killer? I was not alive. So no, that's not an excuse. I knew I was. I'm sick of this one.
[3576.23s -> 3593.59s]  I need a new one. More trees or should I buy? Should I do it about a maple story? All right,
[3593.59s -> 3604.06s]  sure. Let's do maple story. Maple story 2006, two hour compilation. Is this the one you're looking
[3604.06s -> 3622.14s]  for? All right. This is good. I'm going to buy more trees and more fertilizer. The same thing over
[3622.14s -> 3631.46s]  here. I'll buy more nuclear fuel. I love when there's a million on the screen and you just go
[3631.46s -> 3647.56s]  like that. Is it Castlevania? Maple story. I've heard this before. Where have I heard this?
[3648.44s -> 3665.86s]  Have I heard this somewhere? It's in maple story, but I feel like this sounds pretty
[3666.50s -> 3674.54s]  close to something else. It's toxic. No, it's not. I thought about that for a second, but it's not.
[3684.38s -> 3691.37s]  It is. It's not. All right. You guys don't think we're going to get to a point in like 100, 200
[3691.37s -> 3696.01s]  years where every song has been written when already you're telling me that all songs are
[3696.01s -> 3703.94s]  toxic from Britney Spears? And that's now. Really? You don't think in like 500 years that you...
[3710.54s -> 3719.86s]  There's infinite songs. Is there though? Yeah, that's what these scientists say about the
[3719.86s -> 3727.06s]  planets in the solar system, but I can only see a few hundred up there. I can only see maybe a
[3727.06s -> 3749.42s]  few thousand up there. And they say there's quadrillions. I don't know. Yeah. Prove to me
[3749.42s -> 3756.70s]  that we don't live in a dome. Okay. You proved to me that we don't live in a dome. And I'll shut up.
[3756.70s -> 3791.59s]  There are only eight planets in the solar system. Like go outside, dude. We're in a giant snow globe.
[3792.15s -> 3799.37s]  Just wait till somebody shakes us. Yeah. We're just an old snow globe in some alien's attic
[3799.37s -> 3810.14s]  somewhere. And that old alien's going to like pass away. And so the old alien's like young
[3810.14s -> 3815.61s]  grandson is going to come up and go through the stuff in the attic and be like, what's this thing?
[3817.05s -> 3820.22s]  Flowing like a bunch of dust off it. And all of a sudden a huge amount of wind hits us.
[3821.48s -> 3828.20s]  Oh, beautiful. Gonna pick it up and shake it. And just, we're all going to turn to fucking liquid.
[3843.00s -> 3848.57s]  That was Men in Black. That's a really, that's a really great concept. Yeah. It's a really
[3848.57s -> 3862.89s]  interesting concept, isn't it? It's a good movie. Why are you playing this? Um, because I wanted to
[3862.89s -> 3866.01s]  and it was something I wanted, it seemed like a fun game to chill and just talk and hang out.
[3866.89s -> 3872.30s]  While I have, while I'm doing a bunch of stuff and doing a bunch of work and, you know, I'm working,
[3872.30s -> 3877.26s]  you know, I'm working, you know, got a lot of things going on, some projects that you've got.
[3877.26s -> 3881.80s]  Hopefully you'd be very excited about soon. I wanted to come and pop in and say hi for a little
[3881.88s -> 3889.88s]  while. This is some OSTs. To explain to you that there's only maybe 30 planets total in our entire
[3889.88s -> 3906.09s]  galaxy and entire world. Just easy stuff like that, you know? Planets in the world. All right,
[3906.09s -> 3912.49s]  here we go. I'm going for it. Advanced leaf blower. Holy shit, this thing's a shotgun.
[3914.39s -> 3927.83s]  It's so much better. Yep. Look at that. Should I prestige? Should I try it and see what it does?
[3928.47s -> 3934.76s]  It's the same blower. Yeah, but it's bigger and stronger.
[3935.72s -> 3948.38s]  Look how much more powerful it is. Don't do it yet. Does it matter how many apples I've collected
[3948.38s -> 3967.11s]  too? It does. Okay. Chilling out while having existential crises. Is it crises or crises?
[3968.07s -> 3978.82s]  Crises? Crises? How many? Multiple crises would be a crises. Crises. Sounds weird. Crises. It's
[3978.82s -> 3994.04s]  not like a crisis. It's not crises. Crises. Oh, I like this one. Crises is plural. Okay. Yeah,
[3994.04s -> 4010.38s]  that's what I meant. Yeah, cool. I'm getting a lot more gold leaves. That's good. Maybe I should
[4010.38s -> 4017.10s]  stay at the bottom. No, that's not going to work. They don't go far enough. You're going to, oh god,
[4017.10s -> 4029.32s]  I've been on a 20 second latency. Oh shit. Buy combo, you idiot. Gold leaves. What do you mean
[4029.32s -> 4049.53s]  combo? Buy what? Buy a combo? Scroll. Whoa. Whoa. Okay. Leaf combo. Blow leaves away quickly to get
[4049.53s -> 4061.19s]  more leaf rewards. 500. Increase max combo per what? Combo multiplier? Gold apples. Eat some
[4061.19s -> 4078.46s]  gold apples to get gold leaves instantly. Yeah, I want that one. How do I eat it? I'm looking for
[4078.46s -> 4094.17s]  gold apples? You need to talk like Markiplier. Why? Gold apple. No, that's just green. Just eat a
[4094.17s -> 4101.83s]  gold apple. Can I eat an apple? Supporters shop. Leafblower startup pack. Get 400 gems, 20 more
[4101.83s -> 4116.01s]  gems per daily reward, and one times six time travel. Wait, I have this? I bought this? 400 gems,
[4117.83s -> 4127.91s]  one times six hour time travel, and then two times 30 minute time travel. Whoa. What do I do? I've
[4127.91s -> 4147.83s]  got it. What do I get? I press this? It's mine. Gem shop. I'm not buying any of these. I got 400.
[4147.83s -> 4168.50s]  What do I use them for? More trees? Leaf combo. Leaf combo. You just clicked on the gem shop.
[4169.83s -> 4177.94s]  Oh, I thought I was buying 250 of these. Keep your tools after prestige. Increase your leaf
[4177.94s -> 4188.73s]  reward by 750% for all leaves? Like permanently? Permanently. Increase your prestige coin rewards
[4188.73s -> 4198.89s]  by times three. Should I do these? Increases your BLC coin rewards. Ultra fruits. I don't know what
[4198.89s -> 4206.39s]  I should do. I only have 400. Get the first one. Keep your tools after prestige. I got that one,
[4206.39s -> 4219.08s]  okay. Increase your leaf reward by 700 for all leaves. This is the only time I'm ever
[4219.08s -> 4225.37s]  going to play this game. Prestige coins rewards? This one? Prestige coin rewards, time three,
[4225.37s -> 4246.89s]  right? Increase all fruits by 800%. Is that after the prestige as well? Which, by the way,
[4246.89s -> 4256.39s]  what a wild movie. God, it's Christopher Nolan. He's the best. I'm buying it. That's it. I don't
[4256.39s -> 4271.58s]  have any more. This is 34? 34 per leaf? I was doing four. Oh my God. Okay, this just sped up.
[4271.58s -> 4280.04s]  Pay to win, apparently. Well, let's get some more trees. Oh, now we're heating up. This is
[4280.04s -> 4293.96s]  going to heat up like crazy. I have 1.7 thousand? Leaf combo. Combo 50 times two. Max combo increase.
[4293.96s -> 4312.74s]  Holy shit. Plus 102. Don't heat up leaves. What do you guys think the first food that a caveman
[4312.82s -> 4337.83s]  ate was? What do you think it was? Is it weird that I'm going to say other cavemen? But wait,
[4337.83s -> 4344.09s]  no, that would imply that they have to get older. Okay, so hold on. Berries? It started eating stuff.
[4344.09s -> 4358.89s]  How do you know what hungry is? You just have this awful weird stomach feeling and it's like,
[4358.89s -> 4373.96s]  what's this? The first person to ever eat food. I didn't know what that meant. Who was the first
[4373.96s -> 4408.34s]  person? Who was the first person? Bible logic. Who was the first person? Well, it was Carl the caveman.
[4408.34s -> 4412.89s]  He decided that today was the day he was going to eat. He's going to chew with his teeth
[4415.51s -> 4427.48s]  everything he could find. Carl the caveman died very shortly after this, but Cindy the cavewoman
[4428.54s -> 4435.29s]  watched what Carl the caveman ate and noticed that he stopped moving after eating this particular
[4435.29s -> 4441.88s]  rock. So she was like, I'm not going to eat that one. Not going to crunch up that one. So she
[4441.88s -> 4449.13s]  started to eat just random shit until she died. And then Steve, caveman Steve came by and realized
[4449.13s -> 4456.63s]  that cavewoman Cindy ate a branch that he's not going to eat. And he also knows that caveman Carl
[4456.63s -> 4461.77s]  consumed a couple of rocks that were, that made him stop moving. And eventually it got to a point
[4461.77s -> 4482.63s]  where they figured it out. Evolution pretty much. God, can you imagine, can you possibly imagine
[4482.63s -> 4493.83s]  needing to just take a guess? Like, can I even eat this? Like guys, I look at the back of like
[4493.83s -> 4498.87s]  a fucking almond milk and if it's like close to like its best buy date, I go, I'm not sure about
[4498.87s -> 4506.12s]  this. I'm not sure about this. These, these people had to fucking eat just random stuff until they
[4506.12s -> 4532.50s]  died. And then other people just like, what? We've got it really good. He's like caveman
[4535.37s -> 4549.72s]  caveman Andy. And the worst part about this is it's like really think about that. Like water,
[4550.62s -> 4557.29s]  water is essential to live and it's essential to life. But back like hundreds of thousands or
[4557.29s -> 4561.93s]  millions or whatever, whatever it is. Even water could have been dangerous. You know,
[4562.49s -> 4566.89s]  it's like why did he die after drinking that water? We drink water. We drink this liquid.
[4567.69s -> 4574.79s]  Some water cannot be drank and consumed. How the, what? How do we keep track of this? That water
[4574.79s -> 4579.75s]  has like fucking bacteria in it. It like killed him. That water is like salt and it's bad. How
[4579.75s -> 4597.37s]  did they keep track of this? It had to have been some big giant caveman notebook that you went to
[4597.37s -> 4600.81s]  before you went up to go eat food. And you just kind of looked at it and been like, okay,
[4600.81s -> 4616.50s]  green rock bad, red, red, orange rock. Good. Red berry bad. And that person has a huge list
[4616.50s -> 4625.64s]  and that's something that you have to borrow. You do, you can't remember all that. Why are
[4625.64s -> 4646.23s]  they eating rocks? To find out how do animals live? Animals like just eat, but they had to do that too.
[4646.23s -> 4669.90s]  I need more combos. Yeah, I do. Poop diary. A large green bean, poop red. Stay away from green,
[4669.90s -> 4689.26s]  large green bean. Somebody had to keep track of this. Yeah. All of your history books that you
[4689.26s -> 4697.58s]  read in class are just the evolution of the don't eat the bread rock book. That's the first thing
[4697.58s -> 4717.11s]  they had to write down. Ooh, nice. What about bread? They didn't figure that out for like a
[4717.11s -> 4736.31s]  thousand years. He's doing crack rocks. A thousand from what? I don't know. I don't know anything.
[4736.31s -> 4744.10s]  You know, as much as I do, as there is a part of our human history that we have no idea what the
[4744.10s -> 4751.69s]  fuck happened. Cause I have a blurry black and white picture of like my great, great grandfather
[4751.69s -> 4771.00s]  with a top hat on. I don't know what he ate. We don't have, what do we have for barometer? Bro
[4771.00s -> 4779.11s]  history. We know what they, yeah, we know what our like great, great, great grandparents looked like
[4779.75s -> 4803.51s]  but what about their great, great, great, great grandparents? Wild stuff, man. This dude is
[4803.51s -> 4816.86s]  absolutely zonked right now. All right. I'm going to buy some stuff. More marketing. Should I,
[4816.86s -> 4825.64s]  should I prestige? I feel like I kind of should. Combo duration longer. Combo multiplier. Holy shit.
[4825.64s -> 4837.06s]  This is going to be crazy. Hold on. Nice. Get a new leaf blower. I could. It's 5k. All right. I'll
[4837.06s -> 4855.96s]  get the new, uh, stop hogging the bong. Well, we can't have, we can't have like, listen to this music.
[4856.60s -> 4862.15s]  I'm sitting here just blowing leaves and we're listening to like Zen music. We can't have a
[4862.15s -> 4892.30s]  conversation like this. Highest stream 2021. New category. You guys are going to be like just on
[4892.30s -> 4901.21s]  the lookout. You guys are going to be like on the frowl just on every stream. No, that this is, but
[4901.21s -> 4916.34s]  okay. Fine. Add it. That's funny. All right. Fine. Fine. Fine. You can have it blowing leaves and
[4916.34s -> 4925.24s]  talking about like what caveman eight and how they recorded history. Yeah. I get, yeah. I guess
[4925.24s -> 4940.39s]  that is a, that is a, yeah. You're literally blowing the leaves wrong. What? How would you,
[4940.39s -> 4950.01s]  how should I do it? How did they learn mate? I don't know. I didn't know that they had bones
[4950.01s -> 4954.82s]  in their body. They didn't know what they, like you, how did they even? All right. I'm not, let's
[4954.82s -> 4965.14s]  go. This is not going to be highest stream 2021. They did. Yeah. But, but they didn't get it. They
[4965.14s -> 4982.79s]  just knew that they had like stuff in their arms. Let it pile up. All right. Fine. I was language
[4982.79s -> 4999.61s]  made. What the fuck? I know. What the fuck? I get a new lawyer. Nuclear leaf blower. You need to
[4999.61s -> 5008.84s]  take care not to blow away your house with this. Oh yeah. That's a good one right there. Oh yeah.
[5011.83s -> 5026.81s]  This feels good. Yep. Oh, that's perfect. I'm going to let it pile up and then I'm going to blow it.
[5026.81s -> 5045.38s]  Perfect. Watching the stream drunk today was a bad idea. Why? Oh, let's wait. I'm not going
[5045.38s -> 5049.06s]  to do it till it's a ton. Stop, stop, stop, stop. You're ruining everything. Get out of here.
[5049.70s -> 5057.03s]  That's like the dog just did that. You, you scraped up the leaves. You got a nice pile.
[5057.03s -> 5060.71s]  Like the dog just ran out and was like, I'm going to go like that. It just runs through and you're
[5060.71s -> 5075.30s]  like, no. The dog got to have fun before you did. That was fucking fantastic by the way. That felt
[5075.30s -> 5089.74s]  great. What do you think? Should I prestige? Is it time? I got max trees. Should I get to max
[5089.74s -> 5108.44s]  everything and then prestige? Prestige now. Do it. Leaf portal coming up. Platinum leaves.
[5116.55s -> 5125.67s]  I got platinum leaves. No, don't do it. Should I not have done that? Sorry. I got 20. Max everything
[5125.67s -> 5143.67s]  first. I just added a ton more. All right. I added so many more trees. You've ruined it. No, I didn't.
[5145.19s -> 5155.06s]  Chat's omega stupid. Oh, bismuth leaves. Trees can drop bismuth leaves. Dude. All right. This is
[5155.06s -> 5161.38s]  pretty cool. Can you switch to streaming on YouTube so you can, you can watch on your Nintendo switch?
[5163.34s -> 5177.59s]  Um, I'm sorry. No. Just open up a stream on YouTube so this one guy can get to watch on
[5177.59s -> 5191.86s]  this switch while he takes a dump. Ah, that felt good. One million. Guys, I don't even know how to
[5191.86s -> 5198.97s]  stream on YouTube playing this. All right. I think I'm going to prestige. I'm going to go for it.
[5198.97s -> 5206.34s]  Let's go. Yeah. It's time. It's time to prestige. Let's go. Unlock the leaf portal. I bought it.
[5212.14s -> 5216.14s]  Enter the leaf portal to restart your blowing adventure with some coins. 20 plus coins have
[5216.14s -> 5221.46s]  recommended at first prestige. I have 522 coins. All right. Hold on. No, no, not yet. I have the
[5221.46s -> 5239.24s]  counter going. Sorry, one guy. I guess he fucking hates you. 55. Yeah. Well, I want like a thousand
[5239.24s -> 5249.88s]  coins on my first prestige. God, this OST is so based. Is it? That's the first time I think I've
[5249.88s -> 5259.94s]  ever heard it. I felt good. All right. Make sure to do some more upgrades. I'm going to lose it on
[5259.94s -> 5276.30s]  a prestige, right? I might as well just get as much as I can out of this. Based. Based on what,
[5276.30s -> 5289.51s]  Jeremiah? I don't, that's, I know that you're making that joke. You bought the upgrade. Well,
[5289.51s -> 5294.89s]  I have to activate the upgrade. Okay. We can get so many more coins. Look at the percentage just
[5294.89s -> 5307.46s]  ticking up like crazy. I'm going to wait till this is like a thousand. Buy more multiplier.
[5307.46s -> 5316.33s]  Nuclear max combo and multiplier. All right. We got a higher max combo and then we're going
[5316.33s -> 5331.90s]  to do multiplier. Bang. Oh, I don't know what that was. I'm sorry. You need to, you need to
[5331.90s -> 5335.85s]  prestige to get to platinum leaf. So you have to keep that in mind. Okay. All right. But I just,
[5335.85s -> 5340.07s]  I look at the, look at these coins just ticking the fuck up like crazy. I'm not done yet. I want
[5340.07s -> 5347.26s]  those out. I don't know a lot. What do the coins even do? I don't know, but I want them. I don't
[5347.26s -> 5362.04s]  even know what they do. I don't even care what they do. I just want a ton of them. This is what
[5362.04s -> 5375.14s]  it's like having a lawn. Uh, yeah. Pretty much, pretty much this was, is this a act two Diablo
[5375.14s -> 5391.59s]  2? It sounds like that. I love the act two music. Let's go a little more. Uh, I want a higher
[5391.59s -> 5408.84s]  multiplier and I want max out the fertilizer and nuclear fuel, but on Naruto just whip the mouse
[5408.84s -> 5413.24s]  around. No, I don't like that. I don't like that. That hurts my head. I just, I'd like to cleanly
[5413.24s -> 5421.08s]  go through clean lines like that. It's a little slower, but it feels much nicer on the front of
[5421.08s -> 5433.40s]  the brain there. It feels so much better. Yeah. Nuclear, nuclear. You know why it's hard? I usually
[5433.40s -> 5453.37s]  say nuclear. Sometimes like nuclear, nuclear. Sometimes it's fun to say nuclear. Are you eating
[5453.37s -> 5465.45s]  the leaves? Um, I think it's just spraying them off to the side. I get more room. No. Okay. I think
[5465.45s -> 5483.51s]  it's time. How are we looking? When that gets to a thousand, I'll do it. When that hits a thousand,
[5483.51s -> 5503.77s]  I'll go. A Hollow Knight? Uh, no, probably not. Sorry. I'm sorry. What's the OST? This is Maple
[5503.77s -> 5513.75s]  Story 2006 GMS edition. I'm not sure what that means, but that's what it is. Like Dawn of War.
[5513.75s -> 5528.71s]  You mean the good one? Dawn of War 1? Warhammer 40k Dawn of War? The good one? That might be fun.
[5528.71s -> 5539.02s]  That's like my favorite RTS ever. Dawn of War 2 was good. I'm sorry. I'm going to have to disagree.
[5539.02s -> 5545.46s]  I like, uh, I like a lot of units. I like base building. I like the map. I like, no, I don't,
[5545.46s -> 5550.18s]  I didn't like Dawn of War 2. I actually didn't like it at all. I'm sorry, guys. I know a lot of
[5550.18s -> 5554.26s]  some people might be really happy about it, but because we got Dawn of War 2, that's why we got
[5554.26s -> 5560.70s]  Dawn of War 3 the way we did. Keep that in mind. Dawn of War 2's existence is the reason why Dawn
[5560.70s -> 5574.66s]  of War 3 was what the game it became. No, it isn't. Yeah, it is because they got rid of all the
[5574.66s -> 5580.63s]  stuff from Dawn of War 1 and they made Dawn of War 2 about more about, um, like commanding a squad
[5580.63s -> 5585.46s]  and less about like building a base and having like a bunch of units. And then they were like,
[5585.46s -> 5589.67s]  well, what the fuck did we do with Dawn of War 3 now? I don't know. Let's make Dawn of War 2 again,
[5589.67s -> 5610.71s]  but this time worse. Dawn of War 2 campaign is fun, but everything else sucks. I could,
[5610.71s -> 5616.74s]  yeah, I could imagine this probably the case. They have such cool characters too.
[5616.82s -> 5626.17s]  They, um, the orcs. I love the orcs. It's such an interesting, uh, it's an interesting group.
[5626.17s -> 5638.28s]  What's the boss? The big boss, right? What's his name? Big boss. Big. What's his name? Big boss.
[5638.28s -> 5653.02s]  Gorgots here is Gorgots. I'm the boss. I'm big boss Gorgots. I love Gorgots. Now, the cool part
[5653.02s -> 5657.80s]  about the orcs was you just had to have a ton of them. The more that you had, the more population
[5657.80s -> 5678.76s]  like the better you did, right? Oh, that's a great game. It's too bad. Too bad. Pepe face.
[5678.76s -> 5688.34s]  Are we good for coins? Oh, we're, all right, here we go. We're ready to prestige in a minute
[5688.34s -> 5702.10s]  because look at the, look at the counter. All right, I did it. Let's go. Why does it feel like
[5702.10s -> 5714.63s]  it's zoomed in? Is it zoomed in? Daily reward. Oh, sick. Offline. Leaves spawn to each interval.
[5714.63s -> 5722.98s]  10 leaves. Time played. Blowing power. Player HP. Why is there HP? Did I just spoil something?
[5722.98s -> 5741.40s]  You can, Santa. Angel for supporters only. Wait, I can be an auto blower? Leaf cape? Free? Afro?
[5742.31s -> 5751.90s]  Rainbow? Robot? Alternate garden gnome? I have enough to buy one of these. Hitman? Grandpa? Gray,
[5751.90s -> 5763.53s]  green, orange, pink, purple, red, turquoise, white, a bee. Oh my goodness.
[5770.46s -> 5774.84s]  Wait, I need to see the other ones too. Let me see what the other ones are. Bird?
[5774.84s -> 5785.67s]  You could just be a leaf blower. It kind of looks like a, like a astronaut or something.
[5785.67s -> 5795.53s]  Ace of spades? Fruit? Printer? Why would you be a printer? Auto blower? Dangerously funny.
[5795.77s -> 5812.41s]  A cookie? Printer? Go burr. All right, I think I want to be the bee. I like the bee. Or the bird.
[5812.41s -> 5827.86s]  I'll be the bee. Okay, so I now, gold leaves, a shitload of trees, a bunch of fertilizer,
[5827.86s -> 5837.77s]  and a couple more trees. Let's go. Now I can get platinum leaves, you said, right?
[5837.77s -> 5849.99s]  It's the funniest movie of the year. Why are you saying that? Spend the coins. Wait, purchase
[5849.99s -> 5854.07s]  upgrades persist after stepping into the leaf portal. Indeed, travel to faraway places and
[5854.07s -> 5862.71s]  discover new leaves. Unlock areas? Unlock printer. Leaf print machines print and collect leaves
[5862.71s -> 5870.10s]  automatically. Hide it from the tax authorities. How many coins do I have? Not a ritual, but a
[5870.10s -> 5877.98s]  really fancy and useful machine. Unlock converters. Trees upgrades will be purchased automatically.
[5877.98s -> 5887.54s]  Auto buy LBs. Okay, well, first of all, I got to buy the new area. Unlock the auto printers.
[5887.54s -> 5894.65s]  Leaf print machines. Converters? Converters? Oh my God, I have so many more menus.
[5898.30s -> 5905.29s]  Uh, add a printer. Plus one printed leaf per level for all printers. Increases printer leaves
[5905.29s -> 5916.09s]  by a hundred percent. Um, okay, let's auto printer two and buy it. I don't know. I don't know.
[5916.09s -> 5927.62s]  Okay, I'm good. Now wait, hold on. Home garden. Neighbor's garden. This is your neighbor's garden.
[5927.62s -> 5931.86s]  They wonder why there are so many leaves around so recently. And another one too. I can buy this one.
[5931.86s -> 5947.56s]  Mountain. Which way should I go? Should I go to the neighbor's house? Whoa. I go to the mountain?
[5947.56s -> 5959.48s]  Bold converter. Converts a hundred leaves to one gold leaf. Start. Per second? Converts a hundred
[5959.48s -> 5969.83s]  gold to one platinum. Per second. Okay, um, I'm gonna keep this one turned on. Converter batch
[5969.83s -> 5976.81s]  enabled. Start them all. Okay, hold on. We'll keep that one running. Printer shop. Printers print
[5976.81s -> 5991.42s]  leaves every second. Prints and collects 39 basic leaves a second per level. So I'm printing 78
[5991.42s -> 6002.97s]  leaves a second. Print plow. So what's that? What's that? What's that? What is this? What do I do
[6002.97s -> 6007.43s]  about this? There's a bird in the lawn. How do I, what do I do? Do I collect it? Do I spray it?
[6007.43s -> 6031.91s]  Kill it. I don't have any weapons. What do I do? Okay, um, I have no more coins. You have to blow
[6031.91s -> 6038.01s]  leaves into it. Oh shit, really? All right, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Platinum. Spawns more
[6038.01s -> 6047.08s]  trees. All right, I'm gonna, I got two platinum trees now. I got 27,000. Let's get some more
[6047.08s -> 6055.54s]  trees in here. Marketing. Get some auto lowers, auto blowers. There we go. Let's, yeah, let's
[6055.54s -> 6063.85s]  kick it up a notch as Emeril used to say. Go to the mountain? Um, everyone in the mountain is
[6063.85s -> 6080.70s]  annoyed by leaves. I can't hit him. My, that's too powerful. He's too powerful. I need more leaves.
[6080.70s -> 6094.28s]  There's not enough to hit him. My blower's too powerful. Oh shit, I didn't get it. Oh my god,
[6094.28s -> 6104.50s]  that's huge. Come on, come on, come on, come on. I need more leaves. More. I need more. By maximum.
[6104.50s -> 6120.04s]  That's okay. Wait, wait, I have a, I have a lot of gold, right? Gold trees. Gold fertilizer. Trees,
[6120.04s -> 6124.10s]  trees. More, more, more, more, more. Good, good, good, good, good, good, good. Oh, I'm fucking
[6124.10s -> 6139.99s]  excited. You're bad at this game? You can't be bad at an idle game. Addicted. He's addicted.
[6139.99s -> 6160.46s]  Come on, spawn leaves again. Damn it. Equip your hands? That doesn't do anything. What about a
[6160.46s -> 6174.44s]  rake? Oh shit, there's another one. I almost hit it. 63,000? I have 600. Hold on. I need more
[6174.44s -> 6187.03s]  trees. I wonder what you get for, like, killing a deer. Do the neighbor's yard, it's easier?
[6187.51s -> 6197.06s]  I think I'm already invested here. I want the other leaves. Heal. Heal? Why are you guys saying
[6197.06s -> 6209.02s]  heal? Click on this. Sing toxic by Britney Spears for a billion off the debt. I'm not sure that's,
[6209.02s -> 6220.26s]  I don't know if you guys are going to agree to that one. I doubt that's actually what you guys
[6220.26s -> 6231.48s]  are going to do. So I still have the gold converter going. I'm just going to keep that on. 101 gold.
[6231.48s -> 6235.08s]  I have some, I need more platinum leaves. Leaf combo. There it is. Let's go. Come on.
[6235.08s -> 6248.36s]  Max combo. Come on. What the fuck do you think this is? Bunnies have a lot of health. Start
[6248.36s -> 6258.95s]  platinum converter. Should I? It's a hundred. It's a hundred per one. I'm not, I don't,
[6258.95s -> 6267.24s]  no, I don't think so. I'm going to burn through that. Not yet. By the normal upgrades too. Yeah,
[6267.24s -> 6278.87s]  yeah, yeah. That's right. Deal, deal, deal. No, no deal. I was so insulted by that initial offer
[6278.87s -> 6291.85s]  that I just walked away from the table. Prestige again? I could just buy the portal just to have
[6291.85s -> 6302.79s]  it. I have 171 right now. No, I'm not prestige until I have at least like 5k. Look at the snowman.
[6308.39s -> 6320.17s]  You played these shitty games to spite your viewers? You think this is a shitty game? I don't
[6320.17s -> 6328.55s]  think that. Of course, of course it's to spite them. Every time I see the word bald in chat,
[6328.55s -> 6332.06s]  I just add another 30 seconds to when I'm going to play one of these games.
[6332.06s -> 6351.75s]  Kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it. Oh, this is a good song.
[6351.75s -> 6360.26s]  All right. I got a lot. Let's spend some money. More trees, more leaves, more nuclear fuel. And
[6360.26s -> 6370.94s]  then let's do, I need to unlock platinum leaves. 10k. I'm almost there. Let's get upgrades. There
[6370.94s -> 6382.60s]  we go. Nice. Get combos. I will. That's the next thing I'm going to work on. 10k, Andy.
[6386.63s -> 6400.18s]  A little more than 10k here right now. Here's what we're going to do. You ready?
[6400.18s -> 6404.81s]  I'm going to pause this. I'm going to go take a pee break. We're going to come back. We're going
[6404.81s -> 6409.29s]  to do the germa census and then I'm going to continue to play this game. How's that sound?
[6409.29s -> 6778.18s]  You ready for a little break? Sounds good to me. I'll be right back. Oh, we're going cheesy.
[6788.66s -> 6793.90s]  All right. Let's keep going. First thing that somebody writes, whatever it is,
[6793.90s -> 6803.94s]  it's edible. I'll eat it for dinner. Pizza. All right. Cool. Thanks for the help.
[6808.17s -> 6831.11s]  Maybe it should be a hamburger. That's boring. So what? So what? Let's go. Oh,
[6831.11s -> 6843.27s]  I just got 1.2k platinum leaves. Holy shit. All right. Hold on. I can unlock
[6843.27s -> 6849.24s]  bismuth leaves. More trees with these. I don't know. It's probably a mistake. Whatever.
[6857.86s -> 6863.66s]  Census. Oh, oopsie. All right. Here comes the, yeah, let's do the census.
[6863.66s -> 6873.58s]  I'm going to turn this down. So this is an interesting set of images that we're going
[6873.58s -> 6889.91s]  to look at. Here's the 2020. This is very elaborate, by the way. Out of 1,985 respondents,
[6889.91s -> 6894.71s]  I was there. If you were one of them, this is so old. This is very old. This is from like
[6894.71s -> 6900.95s]  May of last year. Let's make that really clear. But a shitload of you probably have not seen
[6900.95s -> 6907.02s]  this before, so I was going to go over it. So how long have you been, out of almost 2,000 people
[6907.02s -> 6912.62s]  that responded, and took the whole thing, how long have you been watching the channel?
[6914.18s -> 6925.24s]  Some of you, as of last year, 15.2% less than one year. 30% of one to four years. The most
[6925.24s -> 6932.01s]  surprising thing for me here is that 54% of you, more than half of the entire channel,
[6932.01s -> 6943.67s]  has been here for five plus years. That's pretty surprising. 2012 gang. They're lying.
[6945.42s -> 6950.62s]  Now, you had to prove it. You had to prove when you made your first YouTube comment.
[6950.62s -> 6963.62s]  So I'm sorry. A lot went into this. Easy. 50% have been following German for five years,
[6963.62s -> 6970.04s]  yet 50% also say the most recent ARC is their favorite. The recent ARC is the favorite.
[6970.04s -> 6977.50s]  And we can look at that right here. Favorite ARC. TF Tuber ARC, Boston ARC, and then Vegas ARC.
[6977.50s -> 6989.58s]  Half of you think that. Interesting stuff. All right, the one guy experience. What do you watch?
[6989.58s -> 6996.17s]  Jerma's stream, Jerma's second, or both? Those of you that ask why I have the second channel in the
[6996.17s -> 7004.57s]  first place, it's because look at the amount of people that do not watch a stream. Ever.
[7004.57s -> 7012.62s]  You got 36% of every single one of you. Maybe. That's the thing with sample sizes, you know,
[7012.62s -> 7021.58s]  maybe. That's why the second channel is trying to, you know, put some time and effort into it,
[7021.58s -> 7028.76s]  right? Because more than a third of you just don't watch the stream. In fact, I'm talking to
[7028.76s -> 7034.71s]  people that might see this on YouTube. So to the YouTube crowd, we love you. Thanks for watching.
[7034.71s -> 7046.31s]  Wherever you watch. Have you ever shown Jerma to your friends? Yes, and they liked him. Okay.
[7047.11s -> 7057.88s]  No, you haven't. And yes, and they thought he was weird. That's pretty high. Yes, they thought he
[7057.88s -> 7068.02s]  was weird. Oh, and Jerma Pluto in the chat. Up here. By the way, it's only a 2.24% margin of error.
[7068.02s -> 7073.19s]  By the way, you see who made this, Krosky. This is the one who put this together.
[7073.19s -> 7081.22s]  Of our resident mods. How often do you watch the stream? Every single stream is only 12% of you
[7081.22s -> 7089.19s]  guys. Several streams a week, several streams a month. Well, let me be fair. Sometimes I only
[7089.19s -> 7102.42s]  stream several times a month. Sometimes you only get like two or three streams a week. But besides
[7102.42s -> 7109.53s]  that, every stream. Well, the highest percentage is the several streams a week. That's my fault.
[7111.29s -> 7120.02s]  12% are lying. And then only, look at this one though. Look at the purple one. Only the Jerma
[7120.02s -> 7124.98s]  second and only the main channel. 20%. That's bigger than all the other ones. Besides the
[7124.98s -> 7131.94s]  several times a week. Several times a month. That's a huge percentage of you guys. The 1.4%
[7131.94s -> 7136.97s]  statistics shown below could be possible, could be people who possibly do not exist due to the
[7136.97s -> 7150.47s]  margin of error. Do you watch Jerma alone or in a group? Alone. In a group or sometimes both.
[7150.47s -> 7165.13s]  69.9%. We don't exist. Oh no. Very cool stuff. Very cool stuff indeed. There's more. You thought
[7165.13s -> 7170.92s]  there was just one little limit. Let's keep going. What kind of psycho watches Jerma985? Let's find
[7170.92s -> 7179.11s]  out. I asked in 2016, I wrote, how many women do we have in this chat? I'm curious. We'll find out.
[7179.11s -> 7188.46s]  79% male, 10.4% female. Look, I just was, I was curious. I was just curious. I was not,
[7188.46s -> 7204.95s]  what do you want me to say? 7.8% non-binary and then 2.8% other. I just wanted to, I just asked,
[7204.95s -> 7220.36s]  okay? I just had to ask the question. It was 2016. I just was like, I was just barely live on Twitch.
[7220.36s -> 7225.51s]  I was just barely live like every other day. I was like, I'm curious. Because we didn't have
[7225.51s -> 7234.18s]  those statistics on Twitch. And then from there, so 79% male audience. How old are you though?
[7234.26s -> 7241.16s]  This is why I can tell you guys. He said we're 12. Are you though? 18 to 24 is the largest demographic
[7241.16s -> 7257.22s]  here. 73.5% of you guys are, I would, in the 18 to 24 range. Not 12. 17 or younger is 14.6%. You're
[7257.22s -> 7261.90s]  not supposed to be watching this stream. You're, you need, you're not supposed to be here right now.
[7261.90s -> 7277.46s]  What's an R rated movie in the United States? 17? Well, okay. And them. And then the 25 to 34
[7277.46s -> 7286.71s]  is 10.7%. There are a pretty significant amount of people that are older. 35 plus is 1.2%. That's
[7286.71s -> 7298.98s]  where I sit. Yep. A whopping 0.2% said they were a rat while one guy said they were Jerma. I didn't
[7298.98s -> 7309.03s]  take this by the way. Here we go. We got kind of the world here. Those of you that always say,
[7309.03s -> 7315.96s]  Jerma, how come you stream so late European? Jerma, it's like, it's two o'clock in the morning EU.
[7315.96s -> 7321.99s]  Why do you do this to us? It's because almost 67% of the entire audience is based in the United
[7321.99s -> 7330.07s]  States, North America. EU still takes up a significant chunk of 23%. But, you know, I got
[7330.07s -> 7339.40s]  almost a 70% group of you guys that are in North America. And I'm in North America. And then after
[7339.40s -> 7349.96s]  EU and NA, it really shrinks down a lot, doesn't it? Asia at 2.1%. Oceanic, 4.2%. The next one. But
[7350.04s -> 7358.98s]  after EU, Oceanic. Interesting. And Antarctica. Almost 1% of you guys live in Antarctica?
[7358.98s -> 7372.66s]  That seems like a lot. Margin of error. I'm the biggest streamer in Antarctica. I guarantee it.
[7372.66s -> 7388.22s]  And then 0.3% Africa. Interesting. South America is up there with 2.7%. Very cool. Very cool.
[7388.78s -> 7396.62s]  Highest level of education. Here we go. How many fucking doctors we got here? Let's see.
[7396.62s -> 7405.37s]  Highest level of education. None. 1.8%. Middle school. 6.5%. High school or GED equivalent.
[7405.37s -> 7419.88s]  56%. Okay. That's good. Look at this one. We got college degrees. 10% associates. 16.7% bachelors.
[7419.88s -> 7428.73s]  2.2% master's degrees. 5% of you guys have doctorates. That's a huge amount of people
[7428.73s -> 7437.40s]  that have doctorates in this channel. Oh, sorry. It's 1.2%. 5.3% of you guys are other,
[7437.40s -> 7444.07s]  which means it's even higher than doctorate. You're a PhD or something. So we got 10. 26.
[7444.07s -> 7455.66s]  Like 27. 28. 29. Like 35% of you guys have doctorates. Rough estimate of annual income.
[7455.66s -> 7468.47s]  Okay. Here we go. $0 to $99 is 30%. $1,000 to $9,909 is 14.5%. 10 to $24,000 is 12.9%.
[7469.11s -> 7480.86s]  $25,000 to $49,000 is 7.3%. $50,000 to $100,000 is 3.6%. And then 1.8% of you guys have $100,000
[7480.86s -> 7488.79s]  a year in income and then 30% of you don't know. Looking at this list here, you don't have to give
[7488.79s -> 7501.51s]  me any fucking money. You understand? It's part of the reason why saying like, only pay me money if
[7501.51s -> 7507.64s]  you really are able to and you take care of yourself and your entire life first. You don't
[7507.64s -> 7513.29s]  have to pay me anything if you don't want to. Ever. Don't ever. Here we go again with this,
[7513.29s -> 7520.82s]  but I got data. I've got data here that you can look at now. 1.8% $100,000 plus a year
[7520.82s -> 7531.82s]  is those doctors. But seriously though, you don't have to pay me any fucking money.
[7531.82s -> 7540.78s]  You got data now. You thought that was it? Not even close. Here we go.
[7542.62s -> 7547.10s]  What are the top five best emotes on the channel as picked by the census?
[7549.59s -> 7557.34s]  Thanks catgirlheadpat for five community subs. 11.4% said fireman's their favorite.
[7557.34s -> 7564.18s]  And that's very close between the German Pluto and German Venus.
[7564.18s -> 7568.78s]  And then the German Defoe is up there over the rat, which is surprising.
[7568.78s -> 7577.82s]  I don't know how that's possible. And here we go. Here we go. You want to see how powerful you guys
[7577.82s -> 7588.10s]  are? Do you hang out in the pre-stream chat or post-stream chat? Pre-stream chat, for those of
[7588.10s -> 7593.90s]  you that don't have any idea, is the time before a stream starts. I don't know why I have to explain
[7593.90s -> 7604.58s]  that. Why am I explaining that? You should get that. Everybody gets that. Almost 25% of you guys
[7604.58s -> 7612.90s]  hang out in the pre-stream chat, which is where a ton of decisions are made. I would say 40% of all
[7612.90s -> 7619.21s]  stream decisions are made in the pre-stream chat. That's pretty accurate for those of you pre-stream
[7619.21s -> 7627.11s]  chatters. I think that's pretty accurate. Don't tell them what? Wait, what happened? Don't tell
[7627.11s -> 7637.99s]  them. Don't advertise pre-stream. Oh, all right. Yeah. I thought you were talking about me. Both,
[7638.98s -> 7645.67s]  which is interesting. So 11% plus 24 is like 30 to 40% of you guys that are making very,
[7645.67s -> 7653.10s]  very strong decisions for the rest of us. Neither though. So 60% of you guys just kind of,
[7653.10s -> 7662.70s]  yeah, that's fine too. That's good. Who else do you also watch? Yep. It's like this is funny
[7662.70s -> 7671.70s]  because this is like, I can tell you this is the my list. Vinny at 58.2%, Joel at 51%,
[7671.70s -> 7683.69s]  Stir at 39%, Kraikin, Italics, James, which is UberHacks on Uber, Tomato and Kiwo. I could see
[7683.69s -> 7696.50s]  that. I would tell you like all these channels here are absolutely worth watching. More than
[7696.50s -> 7706.63s]  half of you guys are Vinesauce crew, which I mean, these guys have done so much for this channel over
[7706.63s -> 7714.17s]  the last couple of years. That's not surprising at all. Yeah. Cheers to Vinny and Joel, obviously,
[7714.17s -> 7720.25s]  for an incredible amount of support and attention I've gotten from like the Vinesauce community
[7720.25s -> 7731.51s]  over the last few years, I'd say. Yeah. That's not surprising at all. I just like that to your
[7731.51s -> 7740.42s]  head. Hey, yeah. Lean in. Hey, cheers to that. Oh, sorry. You'll be fine. All right. So what
[7740.42s -> 7749.70s]  about these? The top five worst emotes. Data may be fucked because I forgot to include German mustard.
[7752.09s -> 7757.35s]  The TV is the worst, but you can't delete it. Something always has to be the worst. There always
[7757.35s -> 7764.44s]  has to be like a lich king, right? If I get rid of German TV, something else will take its place.
[7764.44s -> 7771.45s]  It just has to be there. Bald coin, 10%, but I don't know. Nowadays, I'm not so sure about that.
[7771.45s -> 7778.10s]  We already went over this, but like, I mean, look at it. Look at it now. I didn't delete that emote.
[7778.10s -> 7784.06s]  I left it there and I was ridiculed for having the bald coin emote all the way through 2017,
[7784.06s -> 7791.14s]  2018, 2019, and here we are. Then just take a look at the price now. I'm not a bald coin.
[7791.14s -> 7798.81s]  That fucking is worthless. But the real one. German slug is a bad emote. What's wrong with
[7798.81s -> 7805.11s]  German egg? Can you reverse this? German dab goes up to the top, but I can't, you know what?
[7805.11s -> 7811.61s]  I can delete that now because it's not the worst one. Oh, this is actually a great data.
[7811.61s -> 7817.53s]  German Merck received the least amount of votes for best emote at 0.2% or only three people.
[7822.26s -> 7836.76s]  Only three people. I never see that emote, I'll be honest. In fact, it's probably the same three
[7836.76s -> 7844.17s]  people that are using that emote on a regular basis. German pain, on the other hand, received
[7844.17s -> 7849.77s]  the least amount of votes for worst emote. So 12 people, that's it. German pain is apparently very
[7849.77s -> 7858.46s]  high up there, very highly regarded. What's your subscription? Here we go. I am not subscribed.
[7858.46s -> 7868.73s]  More than half of you are not subscribed. That's good. Just watch. 15% of you are tier 1,
[7868.73s -> 7879.21s]  2% are tier 2, and then 0.8% are tier 3, 20% of you are Twitch Prime, which that's a huge number,
[7879.21s -> 7887.82s]  and then 10% of you are a gif sub. Here we go. This is important. This is important. Oh,
[7887.82s -> 7894.79s]  wait a minute. Wait a minute. Oh, I'm going to pat my back on this one. Hold on, we'll get to it.
[7894.87s -> 7905.03s]  How much have you ever donated to German? $0.75 of you. What's this one? 1 cent to $2.50? 9% of you
[7905.03s -> 7919.61s]  have. $2.50 to $10? 7%. Over 10 but under 25? 2.8%. And then this is interesting here. So less than
[7919.61s -> 7932.07s]  50 but over 25 is 1.1%, but over 50 but under 100 is 2.4%. And then over 100 is more than under 50.
[7932.07s -> 7939.70s]  That's pretty interesting. But yeah, again, 75% of you don't give... I don't. Just don't do it.
[7939.70s -> 7944.02s]  Just hang out, enjoy the stream, chill in the community. That's 100% cool by me.
[7944.02s -> 7953.37s]  So what's the best content? Here we go. What is the best content on this stream?
[7953.37s -> 7967.08s]  Old games, 47%. New games, 32%. Talking to chat, 48%. Playing with others, 27%. Playing the game.
[7967.32s -> 7974.18s]  Playing the game is at 13%. So those of you that are in this chat right now,
[7974.18s -> 7979.48s]  that yell at me to play the video game. Dude, what are you doing? Like, play the game, man.
[7979.48s -> 7987.54s]  That's only 13% of you want me to do that. It's like 80 fucking 7% of you do not want me to play
[7987.54s -> 7999.58s]  the game. German having fun is 60, whatever German like, 70, and anything is 61. They have buzz kills.
[8002.50s -> 8014.14s]  The math doesn't add up here. Oh wait, it doesn't. What's that based on?
[8015.10s -> 8021.06s]  Stop. You can select multiple answers. Oh, okay. Multiple choice. Okay, cool. I see.
[8023.86s -> 8028.50s]  Oh, German heart. Well, thank you guys. Yeah, playing the game, 13% of you.
[8028.50s -> 8032.38s]  Just remember that the next time. Remember that the next time we're talking about like,
[8032.38s -> 8041.94s]  eating dog food for five minutes. And there's that. And there is one more to look at. Really,
[8041.94s -> 8053.03s]  really cool. Last one. Very elaborate, I told you. This first one is no longer relevant.
[8053.03s -> 8057.77s]  You watched the end of the stream bits portion. A lot of you actually did. A lot of you did.
[8057.77s -> 8068.50s]  But a lot of you didn't. Do you take showers? All right, cat or dog? Let's see what we have here.
[8068.50s -> 8077.69s]  Both? Neither. 5.2% of you said neither. Hmm. Looks like we have a little bit more cat people
[8077.69s -> 8087.59s]  here than dog people. I would consider myself to be a dog person. Although, I do enjoy cats.
[8087.59s -> 8092.49s]  I just think I enjoy dogs a little more. I would probably say I was a dog person.
[8093.82s -> 8099.56s]  Do you prefer Twitch chat or Discord? I thought this was going to be a lot
[8099.56s -> 8108.09s]  larger of a gap here. But tons of you guys prefer Discord. That's why it's there.
[8108.09s -> 8118.44s]  Do you like Bugleberry? No, that's not... That majority rules here. He ain't going anywhere,
[8118.44s -> 8128.10s]  ever. That's a large amount of people that say no, but that's a much bigger amount of people
[8128.10s -> 8136.63s]  that said yes. Have you ever canceled plans to watch this stream? Yes, 38% of you guys have
[8136.63s -> 8143.75s]  canceled plans. Is that what happens when people say, hey dude, I took work off to watch this
[8143.75s -> 8156.54s]  stream and it sucked today? Oh, I get it now. I feel bad. Well, sorry to the 38% of you maybe
[8156.54s -> 8162.22s]  that took off work or told your friends you were busy for the Die Dallas encounter stream. Sorry
[8162.22s -> 8176.60s]  about that. FTK, oh no. Do you take showers or baths? 84% take showers. Yeah. Does that mean
[8176.60s -> 8188.89s]  you never take a bath? Because I do both. Put me in that 11.3%. Where's neither? I don't fit in the
[8188.89s -> 8196.38s]  tub. Who takes a bath? Well, I take a bath to relax. I take a shower to clean, a bath to relax.
[8196.38s -> 8207.27s]  I think they do different things. Would you beat Jerma in a fight? No and yes. I think a lot of you
[8207.27s -> 8216.87s]  just underestimate how explosive I could be. People just underestimate me. No, don't underestimate me.
[8216.87s -> 8236.22s]  I'm explosive. No, I can fight quickly, very strongly. Explosively cute.
[8238.68s -> 8245.59s]  Would you attend a JermaCon or a Jexpo? A lot of you said yes to this, but I feel like this number
[8245.59s -> 8259.02s]  drops a ton when the tickets go on sale. This probably drops to like 4%. So I'm not so sure
[8259.02s -> 8270.31s]  about that. Does Jerma make your day better? No or yes? 0.6% said no. Does that mean I'm making
[8270.31s -> 8276.98s]  your day worse? That seems like a lot of people. How many people here right now? 13,000. What's
[8276.98s -> 8290.15s]  1% of 13,000? 130? So there are 130 people here right now that are making your day worse. Oh,
[8290.15s -> 8301.42s]  I'm sorry about that. Do you eat ass? Of course I do, of course I don't. A lot of you guys eat ass.
[8301.42s -> 8314.01s]  A lot of ass eaters. That's a majority ass eater. Are you single or in a relationship? Single. Hey,
[8314.01s -> 8321.43s]  got a lot of single people here. A lot of people in a relationship too. 25% in a relationship.
[8321.43s -> 8327.78s]  25% of people are lying. I don't know. I don't think about that. I'm not so sure about that.
[8327.78s -> 8337.59s]  That's cool. There you go. That was Krosky that made all this. Krosky, you're going to have to
[8337.59s -> 8345.16s]  work your magic again in like another couple of years. You need a dating app. Like a Jerma
[8345.32s -> 8358.46s]  dating app. Do a Cupid stream. No, I do not think so. No, no, no. I'm not having any hand in that.
[8358.46s -> 8366.73s]  Oh, and you two can be together and date. Oh, that's so cool. Like fucking six months later
[8366.73s -> 8376.49s]  when you have a ton of relationship problems. You guys are going to blame me. You guys are both
[8376.49s -> 8385.82s]  going to be thinking internally, why the fuck did I do that? That asshole for content got us on there
[8385.82s -> 8396.49s]  and like fuck that guy. That's what happened. I'm not doing that. You meet somebody, you meet
[8396.49s -> 8411.06s]  somebody. You need to do a Cupid stream. I think we finally do a fake one. Do like a
[8413.24s -> 8421.83s]  have a fake dating show. Too many projects, guys. You don't have to put it on the bottom of the
[8421.83s -> 8427.62s]  list. There's too many things that are happening. There you go. That was the 2020 census that we
[8427.62s -> 8440.04s]  did in 2021. Pretty interesting stuff. The bachelor Jex. All right, let's go back to what
[8440.04s -> 8458.44s]  we were doing here. I need a new OST, please. Something we haven't seen. Sims furniture. The
[8458.44s -> 8478.68s]  Sims by theme. That's not bad. Sims by theme. OK, what the fuck was that? All right, that's good.
[8478.68s -> 8495.56s]  Let's go. So nostalgic. After this, I'm picking streamers choice. We're going to do zoom out
[8495.56s -> 8502.15s]  roller coaster tycoon music. Zoomed way out song. I don't know what it's called. That's what I'm
[8502.15s -> 8520.47s]  going to type into search. How much money do I have? Only 375 coins. Not doing that yet. What
[8520.47s -> 8529.35s]  about the printers? Leaf printer. OK, I need to I need more coins. I need more coins. All right,
[8529.35s -> 8546.01s]  I can start this now. Let's do some up wage. Oh, airplane turbine. I could get the other one,
[8546.01s -> 8559.08s]  but should I? No, no, we got to do upgrades. Get the other one. Leaf powered leaf blower,
[8559.08s -> 8567.19s]  a leaf blower powered with leaves. Full circle. What? I don't get it. I don't understand. What does
[8567.19s -> 8592.74s]  that mean? Is it more powerful? Ow. Like I think ow. Ow, you're right. That hurt. There we go.
[8592.74s -> 8619.37s]  Undertale. I want to hear that. Undertale. Dog song. That's the one, right? Dad. All right,
[8619.37s -> 8640.60s]  let's go. All right. Upgrade, upgrade. Platinum leaves. Drop them. More trees. Drop them. Gold
[8640.60s -> 8647.24s]  fertilizer. Dump it. Marketing. Yell it. Auto leaf blower. Buy it. Nuclear fuel. Turn it on.
[8649.43s -> 8660.10s]  Max combo. Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up. That was it. OK, now what? Let's go to.
[8674.58s -> 8686.65s]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Roller coaster tycoon zoom out song. There it is. Oh,
[8686.65s -> 8707.38s]  fuck yeah. This is the best one. Here it comes. This is the best part. This is the best part right
[8707.38s -> 8725.14s]  here. Fuck, I got it wrong. Not yet. I mean, wait. More, more, more, more. Trees, trees, trees. More
[8725.14s -> 8752.04s]  trees. More fuel. And here. Now we have another one. Bismuth. Bismuth leaves are now dropping.
[8752.76s -> 8773.02s]  This was my printer. Oh, it's the converter. 100 platinum to one Bismuth. Start it. New leaf drop.
[8773.02s -> 8787.37s]  Yep. It's more. Another one. I have a lot of gold. All right, I'm going to dump the gold.
[8788.17s -> 8798.82s]  What do we got? A ton of trees. Fertilizer. More. More. Play Rimworld. I will after this.
[8799.46s -> 8805.37s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. The OST. No, I won't. I'm not going to play the Rimworld OST. I'm not
[8805.37s -> 8811.30s]  because I want to play Rimworld. I don't want to hear the OST before I play the game.
[8812.26s -> 8824.33s]  Kill that snowman. I need more combos. Somebody's freaking out right now going Max combos. You
[8824.33s -> 8839.59s]  stupid streamer. Like Katamari. I do need to play another Katamari. Kill, kill, kill, kill.
[8840.71s -> 8856.47s]  How about the Sonic? Yeah, how about the Sonic? Rolling. Yeah, that's a good one. I feel like I
[8856.47s -> 8866.63s]  play this every time we do songs. I play this every time there's a song request portion of the
[8866.63s -> 8883.61s]  stream. Sing it. No, I can't sing it because it's going to get added to a list somewhere.
[8884.94s -> 8899.40s]  I know. I have 2,000 of the rainbow ones. Sing it. Fine. No.
[8917.05s -> 8921.27s]  The amount of people that sing this song and hum this song and have played this song.
[8922.15s -> 8928.47s]  This is such an iconic song. Is the guy that made this song like get anything for this?
[8928.47s -> 8942.70s]  Is he the official Sonic the Hedgehog music producer? Is this guy's band still doing the
[8942.70s -> 8952.20s]  Sonic the Hedgehog music stuff for all the other things? Yes. All right, that's good.
[8953.90s -> 8964.22s]  I wonder if there's any pressure there. Look at it like follow me, set me free. Everybody loves
[8964.22s -> 8968.38s]  this song. I think he sits there and he's like, fuck, I need another escape from the goddamn city.
[8969.34s -> 8985.26s]  I think this guy makes this fucking gold. It doesn't matter. This song sucks. I don't even
[8985.26s -> 8991.64s]  like Sonic the Hedgehog and I disagree with you. I've not enjoyed a Sonic the Hedgehog piece of
[8991.64s -> 8999.94s]  media since probably 15 years ago. It's honest. I love the character. I think the character is
[8999.94s -> 9005.94s]  awesome. I think the songs are great. I mean, it's what? It's iconic classic video game history.
[9005.94s -> 9019.54s]  This is just auto playing. I'm just going to let it do what it wants to do. All right,
[9019.54s -> 9042.25s]  let's spend some money. Let's max this all up. I said I didn't want to do it. This is why I said
[9042.25s -> 9046.41s]  I didn't want to fucking do this. This doesn't count because I told you it was going to fucking
[9046.41s -> 9064.34s]  happen. It doesn't count. I try. Of course you can't do that. It's an incredibly difficult
[9064.34s -> 9095.96s]  thing to do. It takes like years of classical singing training. It's already put out. Fucking
[9095.96s -> 9107.38s]  learn. You need to fucking learn. You're a dumb time to learn. You need to fucking learn.
[9116.86s -> 9120.38s]  That was mean. I'm not talking about you. I'm talking about whoever's
[9120.38s -> 9125.02s]  currently listening to the song. But the artist decided that was what he was going to do. I'm
[9125.02s -> 9147.42s]  not talking about you guys in particular. Oh boy. Large paint roller. What? Does it hurt?
[9159.66s -> 9213.26s]  Oh, he doesn't. He does not. Um, what does that? It's, um, from Tony Hawk. Tony Hawk's

[9237.27s -> 9244.74s]  Does that happen in the Sonic song? It definitely does. Somewhere at the end.
[9245.86s -> 9253.38s]  And it goes yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Wait, did it just happen? It just happened? Wait,
[9254.34s -> 9272.97s]  did that just happen? Holy shit. Okay. I guess I found it. I guess I found it. Okay.

[9328.17s -> 9340.57s]  raid number two for the day. It's from Five Up. What's up? Five Up. Welcome everybody. Thanks for
[9340.57s -> 9350.04s]  the raid. Welcome to the stream. We're playing Leafblower Simulator. Somebody just, I killed

[9383.03s -> 9389.10s]  It's an idle game and it's so good. It's so fun. It's engaging and it makes you,
[9389.10s -> 9398.01s]  it gets your blood going. My blood is on fire right now. I have to play Splatoon. Oh yeah, sure.
[9398.01s -> 9410.02s]  Splatoon. What's the one that goes? What's the one? Does it a few times? All of them do it. Oh,
[9410.02s -> 9426.49s]  okay. All right. Which one's better? One or two. Splatoon OST. Yeah, this is the
[9430.65s -> 9433.91s]  that's like the royalty free version that I just did, but you know, the one that's a song, right?
[9434.55s -> 9457.96s]  All right. Spend money. I got 1.4 million. All right. Max up the trees, max up fertilizer,
[9457.96s -> 9464.36s]  and then I'm going to start banking money. More combos, more combos. I need way more combos.
[9468.71s -> 9474.31s]  More trees. Get them. More fertilizer. Get them. More marketing. Get the leaf blowers. More trees.
[9474.31s -> 9497.00s]  More fertilizer. Dump it. You're a squid now. You're a kid. You're a squid. Scroll down.
[9497.64s -> 9503.70s]  I will. Change locations. The trees spawn business leaves.
[9505.72s -> 9520.47s]  They what? Couldn't I stay at the other one? Go back. That was wrong. Oh.
[9521.19s -> 9537.85s]  Mm hmm. Oh my fucking God, dude. What the fuck? Oh, that's another rate. What is happening right
[9537.85s -> 9546.90s]  now? This is like the, this is a 10 K rate from Fundy. Oh my God. I got to play leafblower simulator
[9546.90s -> 9556.31s]  every day. This is, this is 10,000 people from Fundy. Fundy. Uh, thank you. This is insane.
[9556.87s -> 9564.94s]  This is like two or three in a row here. Holy shit. Uh, thanks. Welcome, everybody. Hope you're,
[9564.94s -> 9570.42s]  uh, hope you're enjoying your day. We're playing leaf, I got to do the intro again, right? I just
[9570.42s -> 9576.82s]  did it, but I'm going to do it again. Hey, welcome or welcome. We're playing leafblower simulator.
[9576.82s -> 9582.47s]  Uh, leafblower revolutions. Pretty, it's pretty sick. I highly recommend it. If you don't have
[9582.47s -> 9587.10s]  you kind of bored one day, you just want to play a game where you scoop up some, uh, leaves and
[9587.18s -> 9592.22s]  welcome. Thanks for the rate. This is huge. 26,000 people, 25,000. Holy shit.
[9597.40s -> 9606.01s]  Leaf. There's the thing, right? The day that I'm playing leafblower, uh, extreme simulator,
[9606.01s -> 9611.34s]  it's like a stadium full of people just walked in and I'm sitting there just like, I'm playing
[9611.34s -> 9616.92s]  solitaire with myself and like 20,000 people just fucking showed up. This is like how you feel
[9617.48s -> 9622.50s]  if like you have a party that you're throwing and all you have in the fridge is like milk
[9622.50s -> 9626.92s]  and a half eaten bag of Lays potato chips, like the crunchy crumbly part of the bottom.
[9626.92s -> 9631.48s]  And it's like, I'm, I don't, I'm not ready for this company. I guess like you can have some milk.
[9631.48s -> 9638.57s]  You guys like milk. Do you want some milk? Everyone's got like big foam hands and I'm
[9638.57s -> 9645.69s]  passing out like two teaspoons of milk to each one of you. And I just put the TV on. I'm like,
[9645.69s -> 9651.69s]  ah, I got Netflix. I put on, uh, have you, have you seen, have you seen the wire? That's a really
[9651.69s -> 9662.17s]  good show. They will put that on. And then I walk upstairs, there's 25, fucking thousand people in
[9662.17s -> 9669.29s]  my house and I'm just like throwing fucking cold water in my face. All right. I'm going to get
[9669.29s -> 9671.93s]  down there and I'm going to, I'm going to pause the wire and I'm going to piss everybody off.
[9671.93s -> 9677.82s]  Cause it's a great show. I better have something to say that's better than the wire. I better go
[9677.82s -> 9682.62s]  down with like magic tricks and stuff. I gotta, I gotta open up my old like kids magic trick booklet
[9682.62s -> 9689.19s]  but on there and do like coin tricks. The music. Oh shit. You're right. But thank you guys.
[9689.19s -> 9696.63s]  Seriously. This is a, this is just, that's three monster raids in like an hour. Hey, split down.
[9705.66s -> 9709.18s]  Do Presto Magesto again. Yeah, I know. I have to pull up Presto Magesto.
[9709.74s -> 9718.41s]  Put on Xenoblade Chronicles. All right. You're like, give me, uh, give me two minutes.
[9721.59s -> 9738.60s]  Cosmic Leaves can spawn. I can't do that yet. Shit. I keep forgetting to do the combo. I need to do
[9738.60s -> 9752.97s]  combos. I have to do more combos. Another raid? No, it's not. Don't say that. That would be insane.
[9754.86s -> 9768.84s]  No, no it isn't. Put on Tropico. Oh, the Xenoblade is, okay, we'll do Xenoblade after this.
[9769.32s -> 9779.94s]  Put on Chuck E. Cheese. Chuck E. Cheese has songs? Does he just dance to like generic advertising
[9779.94s -> 9788.79s]  music? I feel like Chuck E. Cheese's song, Chuck E. Cheese just dances to like generic rock riff
[9788.79s -> 9810.23s]  four. Okay. What do we got? This is the part. This is what I like this part a lot. Wait till that's
[9810.23s -> 9819.21s]  5k. Not yet. Is this like a, is this a Bon Jovi moment where like Bon Jovi's doing this with his
[9819.21s -> 9844.33s]  mouth? With like a weird like kazoo in his mouth going like wah wah. Oh, that's not Bon Jovi.
[9844.33s -> 9861.51s]  Right. That's not the guitar. That's not the guitar making that noise. No, it isn't. What's that?
[9861.51s -> 9872.15s]  It's my life. It's my life. I can only play the first five seconds of this. Yeah, that's somebody
[9872.15s -> 9889.40s]  going wow wow with like a weird device in their mouth. Yes, it is. I thought I just died. All right,
[9889.40s -> 9894.84s]  we're going Xenoblade Chronicles. Xenoblade Chronicles. Which one? The first one or the
[9894.84s -> 9912.14s]  second one? What do you guys think? This is a little too sad for me right now. This is a little,
[9912.22s -> 9928.42s]  this is kind of sad for me. Who doesn't suck? I don't know. I haven't played it. I need more
[9928.42s -> 9937.14s]  combos. Gold apples. How do I not have those yet? Combos. It's 6.5 million. I'm going to,
[9937.14s -> 9948.25s]  it's got to be, I'm going to have to prestige here soon. Yeah. What is this? All ALBs. What is it?
[9948.25s -> 9960.36s]  Auto leaf blower. Oh, okay. Platinum apples. I don't even, I can't even, I shouldn't unlock them,
[9960.36s -> 9968.07s]  right? Unlock Bismuth apples. Yeah, definitely. Hit damage. Oh, they can actually damage enemies.
[9968.07s -> 9994.20s]  Okay. That's cool. That's too sad. That's too sad for me. Unpluck. What do I need? I need 500
[9994.20s -> 10002.18s]  cosmic leaves to get the new one. Bro, turn this off. All right. Let's get to the middle.
[10003.38s -> 10014.01s]  It's too sad for me. Skip, skip again. It's too sad. This is too sad for me. Skip again. Like
[10014.01s -> 10032.28s]  halfway. I'm six hours into the OST. Are there any snot sad songs in Xenoblade? I'm looking for
[10032.28s -> 10041.38s]  a little bit of pep. Where's the pep? This is good OST, but a little too sad for me. Here we go.
[10042.18s -> 10054.18s]  I need coins. All right. How are we doing on the converter here? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 3000.
[10054.18s -> 10069.69s]  Come on in. Get 5k. These Bismuth leaves are just racking in money. Racking in prestige coins.
[10070.49s -> 10086.10s]  What is it? Racking? Raking in? Racking in money. Yeah, racking in money. Yeah, that makes sense.
[10102.58s -> 10110.66s]  Everywhere. How about some original Nier? I'll give it a try. Just not Nier Automata, right? Nier
[10110.66s -> 10134.39s]  1 OST. Is this the right one? Is this correct? We wanted Plok. Well, hold on. I need more
[10134.39s -> 10148.82s]  Bismuth leaves right now or I'm going to be very upset. Can cosmic leaves even be picked up?
[10148.82s -> 10154.23s]  I don't have to know. They don't. I have to go to another location. No, something else.
[10155.19s -> 10180.28s]  What are you saying? Almost at 5k and then I'm prestiging. This boss is going to be unwatchable,
[10180.28s -> 10192.44s]  will it? Isn't video game music fine? A video game OST should be fine, right? Otherwise,
[10192.44s -> 10206.42s]  how would you like play any of these games on stream? Play Shadowlands. Um, I already did.
[10215.82s -> 10225.26s]  Dermot, I'm shaking. You need to play Killer Instinct. All right, fine. I just want to hear
[10225.98s -> 10230.30s]  Killer. Will you just remind me? I just want to hear that. It goes like this. Hold on. Let me
[10230.30s -> 10238.78s]  see if I can get this out of memory. So anytime that you, I would, I could do an ultra combo in
[10238.78s -> 10245.11s]  that game and you would catch somebody in an ultra combo. I think it was the, it was the wolf.
[10245.11s -> 10247.83s]  I remember I used to play against a friend and I would ultra combo the fuck out of him and this
[10247.83s -> 10268.18s]  is always here every time. And then we have a go. Hold on. Let me get it. Hello? Hello?
[10276.86s -> 10285.94s]  Did that work? I'd just be sitting there going like.
[10292.66s -> 10298.15s]  And I would fuck him up every time and he would, I would leave my house because it was just, I was
[10298.15s -> 10309.72s]  he was so bad. He couldn't even do anything. It was a precise button combo with a glacial,
[10309.72s -> 10322.31s]  glacier. That was the guy I could do it with. I'm sorry. Killer Instinct ultra combo on what's the,
[10323.19s -> 10328.76s]  what's the dog, what's the animal's name? What's the dog? Folgor. No, no, no, not Folgor.
[10329.32s -> 10337.46s]  Oh, what's the, what was the name? Saber Wolf. Okay. Killer Instinct ultra combo on Saber Wolf.
[10339.03s -> 10351.13s]  Like doing it to Saber Wolf. It needs to be done to Saber Wolf. Let's see. Glacier ultra combo.
[10351.13s -> 10355.13s]  Let's see if we can find one that's on Saber Wolf and I'll show you guys how fucking nuts it was.
[10355.69s -> 10407.22s]  Okay. Here we go. Now this is the new one. Do it. Finish the combo, dude. It's 150 hits.
[10408.02s -> 10435.37s]  Holy shit. That was crazy. What's the next OST? Catherine. Okay. Catherine OST.
[10439.62s -> 10463.06s]  Is the complete OST. Okay. This is DMC here. Okay. Catherine, let me ask a question about Catherine.
[10464.14s -> 10469.02s]  So I've looked at it before. Oh wow. That looks kind of interesting. But isn't it kind of like
[10469.02s -> 10485.06s]  a Qbert game where you just like climb blocks? That's where it lost me a little. I feel like
[10485.06s -> 10494.22s]  I probably wouldn't enjoy it that much. It gets disturbing. I'm sure it does, but I don't know
[10494.22s -> 10511.66s]  if I want to do the Qbert stuff. It's also a band game on Twitch. It is? Is the music banned on
[10511.66s -> 10520.04s]  Twitch too? Should I not play it? No, it's not. What? I'm not going to pop like the Twitch algorithm
[10520.04s -> 10525.43s]  off, right? Everybody's playing Catherine. It's a band game. Turn off their stream immediately.
[10528.14s -> 10533.53s]  All right. What do we got? All right. I can prestige. Hold on. Not yet though.
[10534.41s -> 10558.02s]  Let's get a few more minutes of this. Play Katamari. I will. I'm just trying to get as
[10558.02s -> 10567.38s]  much as possible out of this before I prestige. All right. We're at five point. Maybe I can get
[10567.38s -> 10588.14s]  it to like six. More. So we're going to unlock like the next two or three areas
[10588.94s -> 10595.02s]  and I'm going to dump all my money into, I don't know. What should I buy? We'll find out very soon.
[10595.66s -> 10603.32s]  Katamari. Which? All right. What Katamari OST? I've really played the first one already.
[10603.96s -> 10613.66s]  Which one? Your choice. What do you want? What do you feel like? We love Katamari. Oh,
[10613.66s -> 10633.26s]  I thought you guys were just saying that. 55 gems. All right. We love Katamari OST.
[10633.98s -> 10653.00s]  Kind of loud, but all right. Does this one go, no, no, no, no, no, no, no? I hope. I'm just waiting
[10653.00s -> 10658.86s]  for the song to hedgehog guide if this sounds like that. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[10658.94s -> 10667.53s]  You should get them to do that.
[10675.83s -> 10676.63s]  Turn it up. All right.
[10684.92s -> 10690.89s]  I can't do this. Beatbox with them. No, it'd be embarrassing. It's so much better.
[10698.62s -> 10700.46s]  All right. I'm ready to prestige at 6,000.
[10700.46s -> 10708.42s]  Turn it up. I just I will. I don't want to be able to hear after the talk.
[10710.50s -> 10715.22s]  Nothing I hate more than going to like a bar or a party or a restaurant or something.
[10715.86s -> 10720.66s]  And the music is over a level where I cannot talk to you. That's the fastest way to make me
[10720.66s -> 10726.02s]  to fucking leave your house or whatever. If I have to lean in and yell into your ear for us to talk
[10726.02s -> 10736.58s]  about, like what drink you ordered. All right. Yeah, let's go over here.
[10736.58s -> 10756.98s]  Wait, did that happen? What are you saying? I'm talking.
[10761.06s -> 10777.45s]  All right. I'm ready for Steve. Go. All right. I have. All right. Turn this down.
[10779.13s -> 10789.19s]  I have 6,000 coins. Auto upgrade freeze. Should I do that? Let's go down.
[10790.47s -> 10795.19s]  ALBs can collect fruits for you now. Should they also do your tax report? I mean,
[10795.19s -> 10802.79s]  might as well get it. Higher chance to spawn multiple fruits. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.
[10802.79s -> 10806.23s]  Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.
[10806.23s -> 10823.19s]  Yes. No, that's too much. How do I unlock that? More leaves. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.
[10823.19s -> 10831.85s]  Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. More coins. I'm done.
[10831.85s -> 10855.14s]  Space. Oh, my good thing. I clicked that and had enough to buy it. Let's go to space.
[10856.74s -> 10869.06s]  Gold leaves. Come on. More trees. Come on, Gwen. More fertilizer. Come on, Gwen. More marketing.
[10869.06s -> 10881.06s]  Come on, Gwen. Automatic leaf blowers. Come on, Gwen. Scorpions in space. I can't. Next one.
[10881.54s -> 10913.00s]  Hmm. Okay. More. More fertilizer. Enough of that. More money. We are in space. It's perfect.
[10920.94s -> 10926.44s]  I feel like I am one of the princes right now. I feel like this is going to live in that same
[10926.44s -> 10949.88s]  universe right now. Another gold. I do. I have enough for a trees. More trees. More fertilizer.
[10949.88s -> 10974.78s]  Do Mechanicus OST in a little bit. Just hold on. What even is that? What console is that for?
[10975.42s -> 10996.47s]  It's not for console. It's for PC. These things are heavy. Look at it. More trees. I'm going to
[10996.47s -> 11003.08s]  set the converter up now. Old converter. Get that started. And the platinum converter. Get that
[11003.08s -> 11013.40s]  started. Yeah. Printer. How much money do I have? I want to get a cosmic leaf printer just because
[11014.44s -> 11025.46s]  I'm going to get it because I want money. Stop talking. Nobody cares about this game.
[11026.90s -> 11042.82s]  Well, I'm going to beat it. Do you beat it? Do you win? Or is it just never ending? Well,
[11042.82s -> 11053.11s]  I'm going to play until I don't feel like it anymore. How's that sound? Be swore. Oh, let me
[11053.11s -> 11076.98s]  change my skin. Bird. Ace of spades. Okay. I have a lot of... Let's get... I need... I actually need
[11076.98s -> 11098.39s]  to turn that converter off. Turn this off. Buy more trees. Play Sonic CD. All the stuff is at the
[11098.39s -> 11113.10s]  bottom. What? What do you mean? I'm buying it. Oh, I can buy business trees. Void leaves. Trees can
[11113.10s -> 11137.43s]  drop void leaves? What about bismuth? Yeah. More bismuth. I need a better... Oh, hold on. Okay.
[11138.86s -> 11161.24s]  Rocket engine. Pretty powerful. It's hard to blow the cosmic leaves though. These are very heavy.
[11162.46s -> 11168.02s]  Too heavy. I don't like that. Katamari, I love you. All right. We'll do one more Katamari song,
[11168.02s -> 11189.26s]  and then we're going to move on to mechanical OST. Okay. Not this one. Increase your coins. All
[11189.26s -> 11195.02s]  right. Hold on. How many coins do I have? Time travel by 30 minutes. Receive offline rewards for
[11195.02s -> 11203.30s]  the next 30 minutes instantly. Do I do that? Is this going to pretend like I've been playing
[11203.30s -> 11226.63s]  for 30 minutes? No, don't. That's correct, right? Do the six hour one. I just use it? Holy shit.
[11227.43s -> 11241.26s]  Oh my God. What happened? What happened? Holy shit. I have 13,000 coins. Just do that again.
[11242.22s -> 11259.22s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Void leaves. Holy shit. I have so many now.
[11269.59s -> 11283.43s]  I'm about to just go nuts here. It's going to be so much more spawning.
[11290.09s -> 11296.49s]  Get more fuel. Get more blowers. More speed. More battery. More power. Power up.
[11298.34s -> 11304.26s]  Up. I have to. I'm going to do it. Power up. There we go. I feel a little bit better.
[11304.26s -> 11332.82s]  Let's take over the whole screen. I don't have any combos. All right, let's go. 13K.
[11333.62s -> 11348.31s]  Oh, I killed the Vulture. I can sing a song for you and me. I can sing a song for you and me.
[11349.35s -> 11360.25s]  I get it. There's a technique to get the cosmic ones because they're much heavier.
[11371.08s -> 11380.57s]  I love it. This is a great song. What a great song. You guys ever think that when you listen
[11380.57s -> 11385.13s]  to a video game soundtrack and there might be an artist on there that you listen to,
[11385.13s -> 11389.29s]  you're like, oh, holy shit, this is really good. I've never looked up who this person was.
[11390.17s -> 11393.02s]  I don't know what band this is, but I probably would like their music.
[11393.90s -> 11397.34s]  But I just don't. I'm just like, oh, I'm going to listen to that one song that I like that I
[11397.34s -> 11400.06s]  know that you made great. But I'm not going to listen to any of your other music.
[11400.86s -> 11420.09s]  Anybody else do that? Yikes. Yikes. Why yikes? What are you talking about?
[11421.48s -> 11428.60s]  I'm going to do it at 50,000. How's that sound? More, more, more, more, more. Oh,
[11428.60s -> 11443.24s]  I can go up to 50. All right. At 50,000 coins, I'm going to do it again. That should happen
[11443.24s -> 11457.29s]  pretty. Yeah. I'm already at 16.7. I'm like red flasks. More, more, more, more, more, more,
[11457.29s -> 11469.02s]  more. Give me more. Everything. I need more of everything. What song was the one before this one?
[11469.98s -> 11490.06s]  Um, that was called Everlasting Love. 60 coins. Can I do that again? My time.
[11490.94s -> 11495.24s]  Time travel again. 30 minutes have just gone by. How much money do I have?
[11496.12s -> 11516.90s]  I'm at 41 fucking K. This is huge. I need higher combos. Combo multipliers. That'll help.
[11517.54s -> 11532.79s]  Times 31. Play some 8-bit song covers. I'm going to start all these. Then I can get some void ones.
[11534.20s -> 11545.94s]  Holy shit. This game never ends. Okay. Void trees. I'm going to get this to over 50 K.
[11546.82s -> 11551.46s]  Shit. I should have held it and still, ah, I should have held that until I had void trees.
[11551.46s -> 11567.61s]  I can buy one. That's a much better technique. Bottom to top. We'll wait for a few spawns.
[11568.17s -> 11579.78s]  One more and then I'm going to go top, bottom to top. Ready? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. That's the one.
[11579.78s -> 11588.31s]  That's the technique right there. Let's do, wait to, oh, my automatic pushers are doing great too.
[11589.27s -> 11601.11s]  Oh, you know, I love it. More void trees and more void fertilizer and more void apples.
[11601.91s -> 11612.86s]  Tell us a story. One day there was a little boy who went to get a pail of water. He got it. He
[11612.86s -> 11620.55s]  filled up his burkey and he loved it. It was clean water. It was crisp and all contaminants were
[11620.55s -> 11644.44s]  removed. What do I got? 45. I'll wait till 50. Maybe I should just do it now. Fuck it. Right.
[11644.44s -> 11655.22s]  Just do it now. I think I'm just going to do it now. Oh wait. Maybe I should buy another. What?
[11657.85s -> 11673.90s]  Oh no. Okay. Use it. 70,000 fucking coins. Oh, a laser.
[11680.44s -> 11693.91s]  This is much more powerful than the cosmic ones. Oh, look at this. More coins. Shit to do. All
[11693.91s -> 11709.56s]  right. Hold on. Is this all max? Buy max. Buy max. Buy max. Buy, just buy, buy max. Buy max on
[11709.56s -> 11725.35s]  everything. Hey, what about four? Buy max on everything. Yeah. This is not gas. Max, max, max,
[11725.35s -> 11738.31s]  max, max it all up. Buy an enemy bumper. Okay. More. Max out everything. And then I'm just going
[11738.31s -> 11743.21s]  to coast for a little while and then I'll prestige. And I'm going to buy like an area that's like five
[11743.21s -> 11756.39s]  times over here. Okay. Here we go. Let's just collect for a little bit. 71,000 coins. Promise
[11756.39s -> 11761.54s]  center, second opinion. Yeah. We've been hunting for long enough. All right. Persona four, golden
[11761.54s -> 11765.94s]  OST. Sure. What the fuck did I just do? I think I just print screened like five times. Oops.
[11766.50s -> 11788.92s]  Persona four, golden OST. DFCA? Oh. Should I be aware of that? Should I be aware of that?
[11791.45s -> 11816.01s]  Are we sure? One guy. Okay. Oops. I think a bug just flew in my eye.
[11817.42s -> 11821.42s]  Like a bug just tried to desperately get into my eyeball, I think. I freaked out and just
[11821.42s -> 11827.26s]  grabbed my face. I don't know. I have no idea what happened. I could feel like a bunch of legs
[11827.26s -> 11832.14s]  climbing into my eyes. I just, I just slapped and grabbed him through. I'm not going to look down.
[11841.22s -> 11847.75s]  You promised a mechanics. Oh, all right. Do that next. 73. It's not going to go up any higher.
[11847.75s -> 11864.42s]  I don't think. Time for Steve's. Let's go. Go 70. I want 75k. I need to, I have to see it. 70.
[11864.42s -> 11881.50s]  No, fuck it. I don't care. All right. 73,000 coins. We are looking for a new area. There's
[11881.50s -> 11897.32s]  the void. And then there's 990,000 of these potions, whatever that is. Okay. So upgrade,
[11897.32s -> 11903.32s]  auto-upgrade trees. Let's get it. Auto-upgrade fertilizer. Get it. Auto-upgrade marketing. Get
[11903.32s -> 11913.37s]  it. Auto-upgrade nuclear. Get it. Buy everything. Buy everything. Auto-unlock flasks. Buy them.
[11915.06s -> 11924.73s]  Add a bunch of printers. Add multipliers to those printers. Increase that converter count.
[11925.37s -> 11937.98s]  Increase the converter output. Prestige. More coins. More leaves. Come on. I ran out of money.
[11937.98s -> 11962.57s]  Give me the leaf portal. I want it. All right. We're already at 2000 coins.
[11964.30s -> 11991.77s]  Okay. Mechanicus. Mechanicus OST. There you go. 72 hour time travel. The game's running for three
[11991.77s -> 12006.97s]  days. Why do I want to buy the pack to do that? Just see what happens. All right. I got the
[12006.97s -> 12024.49s]  converters going. Get them started. Let's go. Boot them up. Turners going. Boot them up. All right.
[12024.49s -> 12040.50s]  We need more combos. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. What is the potions? Green flasks.
[12042.25s -> 12066.09s]  Science research? What? How do I make a flask? Is it voids? Oh, red flasks. I have the auto leaf
[12066.09s -> 12073.90s]  buying going on, right? Yeah, I do. Yeah. Everything is on auto-buy right now. I just have to collect.
[12074.94s -> 12079.50s]  I have to collect and watch this number. It's already at 15,000. Holy shit. Okay.
[12079.50s -> 12100.15s]  Maybe should I get to like two 500,000 for that? A million? It's a 900k? What's the next? All right.
[12100.15s -> 12109.62s]  It's 500 red potions for the next upgrade. They didn't make a potion though. I feel like it would
[12109.62s -> 12122.17s]  be here. Unlock red flasks. Did they just show up? You buy them from the potion seller. Unlock a
[12122.17s -> 12149.56s]  green flask. It says converter under it. Converter. Let's go. Reduce. Doubles the resource input output
[12149.56s -> 12162.50s]  for all converters. Oh man. All leaves plus 20%. Holy fuck. Okay. 20% per level. Reduce the converter
[12162.50s -> 12180.76s]  cost. Increase the output. Increase everything. Make it all huge. 495 million. Oh Jesus. Okay.
[12180.76s -> 12196.06s]  Hold on. Reaching leaf end game? Maybe. When you can play meat. You guys keep trying to get me to
[12196.06s -> 12202.65s]  say that and I'm not going to say it. You guys keep trying to get me to say meat, the meat and
[12202.65s -> 12215.54s]  something. Game. Oh, I don't know what it is, but whatever. Alien turbine. Where did you get this?
[12215.54s -> 12228.55s]  That's pretty good. This is a big blue popsicle stick. Geez. It's getting, all right. It's getting
[12228.55s -> 12239.37s]  kind of hard to manage. Look at all these achievements. It's a popsicle. It won't say
[12239.37s -> 12248.94s]  meat and fuck, but we'll say fuck and learn. No, I said fucking learn. Like as an adjective,
[12248.94s -> 12267.13s]  like you need to fucking learn. I already have 50k. I'm going to get this to at least 500,000.
[12267.13s -> 12280.46s]  At the very least. I just love clicking stuff. All right. We got, hold on. Green flasks have
[12280.46s -> 12290.62s]  been purchased. Where's the converter? Start converting green flasks. Oh gee. Unlock blue
[12290.62s -> 12306.74s]  flasks. All leaves plus fucking 50, 100%. More converter output. More. Um, what is this? Buy.
[12307.46s -> 12312.02s]  Ace of spades. If you'd like to blow leaves, I tell you you're, I'm your man. Going with the blow.
[12312.02s -> 12322.68s]  It's all a game to me. I am the ace of spades. Wait, is that the?
[12327.96s -> 12346.06s]  The same to me, right? That's also from Tony Hawk. That's a great game.
[12346.78s -> 12361.38s]  Back, back, back, back. Okay. Uh, more converter damage, more output, more leaves. I think
[12362.18s -> 12371.67s]  we're about to cross where we just stopped. 75 K a slime rancher. I do have to play slime
[12371.67s -> 12391.46s]  rancher. You're right. You don't just fucking just skip 30 minutes. Yep. 225 K blue flasks are open
[12392.18s -> 12402.90s]  all leaves, all leaves. All right. Blue. I need the converter. We need to do blue flasks
[12403.54s -> 12412.22s]  now that we have blue at magenta flasks. What the fuck? This is just, this is too much. There's
[12412.22s -> 12420.47s]  too many like compounding things to touch. I feel like we've listened to the same song for like an
[12420.47s -> 12445.78s]  hour. This is dark night music. Not anymore. Okay. Blue flasks, more, less resources, more
[12445.86s -> 12454.01s]  leaves. Let's go to magenta. Convert to magenta. Unlock orange flasks.
[12455.75s -> 12469.83s]  But we can't. How many are there? I need more blue flasks. I need more output on the converters.
[12476.89s -> 12499.10s]  God, 250 K. Should I? Oh, was it half a million? Blowfish. Uh, okay. Cool. A graphics card?
[12499.74s -> 12515.03s]  An overclocked graphics card with a large fan. Okay. I need orange flasks. Where was it? The
[12515.03s -> 12527.45s]  bottom of the list, by the way. Unlock black flasks. Um, unlock big leaf crunch. Unlock
[12527.45s -> 12550.95s]  the big leaf crunch. Okay. I need more. I don't have enough. Reduce the resources and make the
[12550.95s -> 12563.83s]  output bigger. The end of everything. The big leaf crunch met 358,000 by the way. Prestige now.
[12564.81s -> 12577.42s]  Hold on. Not yet. I need to see what it looks like. Does the converter look like? The converter
[12577.42s -> 12586.07s]  has to be better. I have to prestige the converter. Yeah, let's go. I'm out. Like 990 K. I can't even.
[12586.07s -> 12596.17s]  What kind of potion is that? I don't have any of those. That's like a yellow and red potion.
[12596.73s -> 12609.96s]  All right. What's the next OST? All right. I'm, I'm doing it. I'm pressing the button.
[12610.60s -> 12617.90s]  I'm going to press the button really soon here. I'm going to buy max on everything,
[12617.90s -> 12634.89s]  run around in a circle for a minute and then we're going for it. All right. Let's do it.
[12634.89s -> 12642.89s]  What do you think? 400,000? Oh, pluck. Right. People were looking for pluck.
[12650.18s -> 12675.40s]  Here we go. Prestige. All right. Now this is very important. I have 370,000 coins.
[12678.50s -> 12682.76s]  Cannot buy a new area. All right. The printers need to be better.
[12685.30s -> 12694.90s]  Leaf printer. Let's get this up to like 2K or so. Okay. I need way more of these.
[12700.68s -> 12710.97s]  Void leaf printer. Okay. What are these? Now converters. I need better converters.
[12714.06s -> 12722.98s]  My money. Printer. One printer added. Printer multiplier. Increase converter count.
[12725.80s -> 12734.63s]  Where's reduce? All printers. All printers. Get better. Increase the converter count.
[12735.19s -> 12747.43s]  Increase converter output. Oops. All upgrade discount. Oh, that's expensive.
[12749.99s -> 12766.17s]  More void leaves. More everything. More money. More leaves. More printer multipliers.
[12769.08s -> 12792.92s]  Hell yeah. Oh, hell yeah. Oh, man. Look at that number crawling up already. All right.
[12794.38s -> 12806.55s]  Let's get started here. Turn on the converters. One, two, turn them. Start them off. Whoa.
[12810.97s -> 12833.00s]  Okay. They're on. Converters are on. How come they're green? Where's my potions? It takes years.
[12833.64s -> 12848.22s]  Shouldn't.
[12854.46s -> 12867.86s]  What do the apples even do? Reduce those resources, dude.
[12868.66s -> 12878.57s]  Reduce the resources. Reduce the resources. Increase the output. More leaves.
[12879.99s -> 12889.88s]  Oh, I love it. More leaves. More leaves. I'm turning into Jerry Seinfeld. What the hell am I doing?
[12900.41s -> 12907.54s]  More. That's going up even higher now. What was that? 300? Let's try to get to a million.
[12908.26s -> 12913.10s]  Put on DuckTales OST? Yeah, that's way better than. Well, that's not way better than Pluck,
[12913.10s -> 12924.09s]  but that's a way better idea from me. That's way better from me. We have to skip the first one.
[12924.65s -> 12953.74s]  All right, we're good here. They should be in Smash Brothers. This is fucking stupid. He should
[12953.74s -> 12959.67s]  be there. Scrooge McDuck should be in Smash Brothers. Think about the songs. The remixes
[12959.67s -> 12967.11s]  they would have in that. I don't care if it's been Disney. I don't. It's like a classic Nintendo
[12967.11s -> 12971.27s]  game that everybody knows. If you've opened up a fucking console and put a disc in it,
[12971.91s -> 12977.91s]  you know the DuckTales game. You don't think they could do it. Look at the moveset. It would
[12977.91s -> 12983.67s]  be amazing. You could do like the... You could bounce around and be down B. It could even be
[12983.67s -> 12990.47s]  recovery. Whatever. You do the golf club side B. The gems. He has the little diamonds he could
[12990.47s -> 12996.71s]  throw out like a standard B. Oh, it's Disney. I don't like Disney. Well, it's a classic Nintendo
[12996.71s -> 13019.26s]  game. I don't care already. It's not about liking Disney. Disney would never agree to it.
[13022.78s -> 13029.94s]  I don't understand. Think about a bunch of classic Nintendo games that required
[13031.26s -> 13037.08s]  Disney to be on board. Think about all the Mickey Mouse games, all the Donald Duck cameos that were
[13037.08s -> 13043.14s]  in fucking Nintendo games. It was like a hundred fucking Disney games, like Mickey Mouse games
[13045.06s -> 13049.37s]  on regular Nintendo and Super Nintendo. But now all of a sudden they don't want to be put in video
[13049.37s -> 13062.87s]  games anymore. I can name you at least like 10 Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck goofy video games
[13062.87s -> 13065.83s]  that were on Nintendo and Super Nintendo. And now that is what? You have to be part of Kingdom
[13065.83s -> 13079.32s]  Hearts now? Do it right now. Fine. Fine. Let me just think for a minute. Magical Quest starring
[13079.32s -> 13086.82s]  Mickey Mouse. Mickey Mousecapade. The Great Circus Mystery starring Mickey and Minnie. Mickey Mania.
[13088.09s -> 13092.01s]  Adventures in the Magic Kingdom. And this is just Mickey Mouse, by the way.
[13092.01s -> 13103.45s]  Plus we have Mickey's Adventure in Numberland. Mickey's Safari in Letterland. Disney's Magical
[13103.45s -> 13107.93s]  Quest 3. That means there's a 2. Legend of Illusion starring Mickey Mouse. Mickey's Ultimate
[13107.93s -> 13114.71s]  Challenge. Mickey's Dangerous Chase. Mickey No Tokyo Disneyland. Donald in the Magic Cap.
[13118.07s -> 13132.60s]  There's like 50 of these. Donald in the Magic Cap. What is it for? Donald Duck No Maho No Boshi.
[13132.60s -> 13141.67s]  Disney Wiki is what this sounds like. Donald Duck in the Magical Hat and the Magic Cap was
[13141.67s -> 13147.67s]  released for Nintendo Super Famicom by Epoc in Japan only in 1995. Starting Donald Duck with
[13147.67s -> 13155.61s]  guest appearances by Daisy Duck, Pete, Grandma Duck, Butch the Bulldog, and Goofy as the announcer.
[13155.61s -> 13171.58s]  Why do they not make video games anymore? What happened to the music? They do. What was the last
[13171.58s -> 13176.78s]  Mickey Mouse video game that wasn't Kingdom Hearts? And by the way, I don't count Kingdom Hearts.
[13176.86s -> 13186.18s]  That's not a Mickey Mouse game. That's not like you control Mickey Mouse and jump around.
[13186.18s -> 13202.07s]  They made Epic Mickey like 12 years ago. Epic Mickey was shit. You can control Mickey in 2.
[13204.76s -> 13214.84s]  Epic Mickey came out for the Wii in like 2009 or something. Yeah, you can control. Yes, yes,
[13214.84s -> 13222.60s]  yes, sure. Spoiler alert. In Kingdom Hearts 2, if you have it on like easy mode, if you turn the
[13222.60s -> 13236.90s]  difficulty down, you like can't lose because something happens and like somebody comes and
[13236.90s -> 13245.34s]  like just make sure you don't lose because and they made them all like Jedi's. I don't know.
[13245.34s -> 13260.09s]  I don't understand it. Stop talking. It's not even, what is, how is that a spoiler? How do I
[13260.09s -> 13265.85s]  know this? I play, what? You don't think I played Kingdom Hearts 1? Holy shit. All right, I gotta
[13265.85s -> 13275.42s]  focus. Let's do, how about Magical Quest starring Mickey Mouse OST. By the way, this game is
[13275.42s -> 13289.42s]  incredible. All the old Disney games are really, really good. All right, I need some converters
[13289.42s -> 13302.06s]  going here. They are going already. Produce those resources. Make it more. I want more stuff. I'm
[13302.06s -> 13332.31s]  pissed off. Green leaf converter. I'm gonna say, all right. Play, pray, devils make, never cry.
[13338.15s -> 13346.01s]  Mouse is gonna get you. Mickey Mouse is gonna get me for playing the OST for a game that's like
[13346.01s -> 13372.49s]  30 years old. Yes. Really? Mickey has no forgiveness in his heart. He's just evil.
[13373.05s -> 13380.68s]  I'll just buy one of these. I've been playing this for like four hours. Holy shit.
[13389.38s -> 13404.94s]  Upgrade your leaves. Pepe mad. Upgrade your leaves. Pepe mad. All right, let's do it. Four,
[13409.91s -> 13439.51s]  five, six, more, seven, D. God damn it. I need more of this shit. Come on. All right, G. Here we go.
[13444.07s -> 13457.94s]  H. Orange flasks. Not yet. All right, we're at 200,000. Payday two. No, what else we got?
[13457.94s -> 13470.38s]  Remember, don't big leaf crunch. It sucks and made me want to cry. Oh, sorry. Turtles in time.
[13471.02s -> 13476.98s]  That's a classic. You're flushing a bunch of flasks down the drain, am I?
[13477.62s -> 13487.03s]  Rollercoaster Tycoon 3. Play it. It's so good. I have this weird memory where I played Rollercoaster
[13487.03s -> 13494.23s]  Tycoon 2 on stream. Did I play Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 on stream? I don't think I have. I made a video
[13494.23s -> 13525.06s]  on it. I don't remember. Do the arcade OST. Is it different? This is higher quality. This is fantastic.
[13525.06s -> 13537.29s]  What is this? Turtles in time arcade soundtrack. Okay.
[13553.46s -> 13558.90s]  Sounds like worse than though. Let's see. Okay. Big Apple 3 AM is a really good indicator if the
[13558.90s -> 13584.81s]  SNES version is better. I mean it. SNES one's better. That's much better. I would put that.
[13585.77s -> 13598.74s]  I would have to say it's way better. Let's see. Oh yeah. That's way better.
[13602.73s -> 13604.01s]  The trumpets are way more prevalent.
[13620.33s -> 13634.94s]  Big Apple. I feel like this just fits everywhere. It's so good. It goes everywhere. My toe. My toe.
[13640.06s -> 13665.02s]  You're 78. All right. I need to get at least a million. I beat this game probably a hundred
[13665.02s -> 13676.63s]  times. We've already talked about it. Where the fuck is the narrow toe OST? Why would I play the
[13676.63s -> 13698.34s]  narrow toe OST right now? That's just. That's DMCA. That's just songs. Come on. 300k. Come on.
[13698.34s -> 13704.15s]  More green. Converters create more output resource. Increase converted output by one for the current.
[13705.19s -> 13729.56s]  This is a good one too. I love this one. Remember your red flashes. Holy shit. What? What? What is
[13729.56s -> 13744.01s]  it? I got tons of these. I need more output from. I need more output from here. From red. I need more
[13744.01s -> 13758.06s]  red. Stop converting. What do you mean stop converting? Why? Turn off the flash. Red flash
[13758.06s -> 13786.52s]  converter. Why would I do that? Finally. What? Don't convert until you upgrade red. All right.
[13786.52s -> 13804.66s]  I got you. What's my favorite one? Technodrome. I love the train and I love prehistoric turtle
[13804.66s -> 13824.39s]  source. This is a good one. I love this part because it's the guys that charge. They just
[13824.39s -> 13839.50s]  run straight at you. Now how are we doing on red? We're doing really good on red. All right. More.
[13840.22s -> 13854.89s]  That's good. Where's the skull and crossbones? No, not that one. There it is. Oh, this is a
[13854.89s -> 13878.34s]  classic Jerva making my day worse. This is one of the train, right? What was the alligator's name
[13878.90s -> 13893.29s]  in Ninja Turtles? What's his name? Leatherhead, right? Leatherhead, right? I forgot about
[13893.29s -> 13899.82s]  Leatherhead. Oh, Neon Knight Riders is awesome too. This whole thing is awesome. This is a really
[13899.82s -> 13923.11s]  good game. Just about to cross. Scream it. Yeah. I should just scream it and beat it. You want to
[13923.11s -> 13938.57s]  have a nostalgia scream where I beat turtles in time like three times? All right. Turn it on.
[13938.57s -> 13959.29s]  Let's get green going. You cowered it out after dying once in the retro scream last week. You
[13959.29s -> 13966.15s]  think you can beat it three times? Well, I mean, that's a little different. The retro scream was
[13966.15s -> 13976.06s]  there were 620 games on that box. I needed time. I wasn't going to give every second dedicated to
[13976.06s -> 13990.47s]  Ninja Turtles. It was like 600 fucking games on that thing. All right. How are we doing on green?
[13991.27s -> 14001.61s]  More. I forgot about that. Where no turtle has gone before. And let me tell you something about
[14001.61s -> 14012.49s]  the Shredder, okay? Super strong, super powerful, has a cool group. I'm not going to do that again,
[14012.49s -> 14026.17s]  no way. All right. 55,000. Almost time. Almost time to just absolutely let this just fly off.
[14028.28s -> 14046.87s]  Want more converter count? For Shredder Synth. The boss theme. Let's get that going.
[14051.64s -> 14067.21s]  I love doing the Shredder. Let's take my favorite thing. Get into it. I need one million.
[14081.99s -> 14089.37s]  All right. Let's turn on the blue. Coming up next. We've got blue. I know you're all
[14089.37s -> 14102.06s]  so excited for it. Once this crosses like 50k. Here it is. Turn on the blue.
[14102.06s -> 14124.81s]  Blue. Devils never cry. Let's see. What's the versus mode one? That song was good too,
[14124.81s -> 14140.82s]  wasn't it? Yeah, here it is. This is a great song. Not this one. It's the one right after this.
[14151.54s -> 14187.40s]  This is the one I like. If that's 10. Devil will cry. Got a link. What do we got this time?
[14187.40s -> 14194.52s]  What do we got this time? Joe Biden will erase a billion dollars off the debt. If you stream
[14194.52s -> 14216.02s]  Bionicle Mask of Light. What does this picture do? Why is it Joe Biden? Joe Biden will erase
[14216.02s -> 14222.49s]  a billion off the debt. The nation is watching. Germany, do our country proud. J-Dog from Joe
[14222.49s -> 14229.53s]  Biden. Stream Bionicle Mask of Light. It's free on YouTube. Lego will not DMCA you. They allow
[14229.53s -> 14246.65s]  the movie to have free online distribution. What? This is a movie? You want to watch this movie?
[14246.65s -> 14258.62s]  Okay. All right. Fine. I'm going to look into this. I will stream Bionicle Mask of Light
[14260.79s -> 14266.26s]  on a stream coming up soon. Probably in the next week. Is this for real?
[14270.58s -> 14281.37s]  Do it right now. Should we get a pull for this? That's a pretty significant amount of money.
[14281.37s -> 14300.38s]  This is just a simple yes or no. Is it? Okay. One billion off the debt if Bionicle
[14302.28s -> 14326.14s]  Movie stream. Okay. Here we go. I didn't vote. How much do we have for current? We're at four
[14326.14s -> 14347.18s]  billion right now currently. 92%. Holy shit. Well, I think we have a deal. This is a landslide.
[14353.67s -> 14363.58s]  This is Joe Biden that's going to do this. All right. That's unanimous. That's 90%.
[14364.62s -> 14370.39s]  All right. Let's go. Let's do it. Not now. But at some point, one of the next streams that you
[14370.39s -> 14377.22s]  see on this channel is going to be Bionicle Mask of Light streamed movie stream. If that's actually
[14377.22s -> 14386.10s]  true and I can do that. If I can truly actually stream that movie, I will. I got to look into that.
[14388.38s -> 14405.86s]  Hey, thanks a lot, Joe Biden. All right. What are we doing? Oh, I get to look at all my money.
[14406.74s -> 14415.06s]  I got to turn on the purple now. What's this? Oh shit. Perfect. Yeah. I'm keeping this on.
[14415.86s -> 14439.86s]  It's Mega Man X. All right. This one's ready to go. I have so much blue. I'll go too crazy with that.
[14443.88s -> 14461.10s]  I got to get these all 10. All right. Hold on. Let's get it to 10. You have to get Joe Biden
[14461.10s -> 14479.72s]  on the stream to watch it with you. I don't think that would. I don't think that's going to happen.
[14479.72s -> 14486.36s]  I'm sorry to say that would clear the debt. That would undo. I don't know. That's not going to
[14486.36s -> 14499.67s]  happen. It went to the part when like the Bionicles are about to lose. Oh, come on, man.
[14501.00s -> 14511.56s]  No, this is this is malarkey. I hate everything about this. I know Joe is fucked up. Hey,
[14511.56s -> 14530.26s]  watch that language, please. I'm sorry, Joe. I mean, Mr. Biden, President Biden, Mr. President,
[14530.26s -> 14535.38s]  Mr. President Biden, Mr. Biden, please. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to say those swear words.
[14536.36s -> 14543.77s]  That's OK. But here's the deal. You say one more of those swear words, we're going to have a big
[14543.77s -> 14564.14s]  problem. He says Bill Clinton. I'm trying to enjoy my gosh darn. I just made him say my swear.
[14576.81s -> 14582.65s]  I just keep being like the Bionicles. Oh, Joe, Joe, the Bionicles are never going to make it.
[14582.65s -> 14587.29s]  I don't think they're going to make it, Joe. Chad, what do you guys think? Will you just shut up,
[14587.29s -> 14601.58s]  man? What? Trying to watch the movie here. Yeah, of course they're going to make it.
[14602.71s -> 14621.40s]  They're the damn Bionicles. Now hear me. How much do I have? Oh, five hundred and eighty two K,
[14621.40s -> 14634.31s]  Joe. Can you believe it? Biden onicle. All right. It's time to turn on the orange ones.
[14640.82s -> 14659.21s]  More, more, more, more money, money, money, money, money. Bidenicle. Actually might be kind of funny
[14659.21s -> 14665.21s]  just to have like a few Joe Biden clips of him just telling me to stop talking and enjoying
[14665.21s -> 14673.35s]  something, being like, oh, this great. Wow. I'm going to watch Bionicle with Joe Biden.
[14673.99s -> 14684.38s]  Just have a bunch of soundboard here of him enjoying the movie with me.
[14686.92s -> 14698.97s]  I mean, that's kind of a layer there. Iron impersonator. And we have a cam on in the same
[14698.97s -> 14710.71s]  room. No, but then the real Joe Biden has to open the door and be like, what are you doing in here?
[14711.51s -> 14721.38s]  And then the audience track has to be like, and he looks side to side and they don't stop clapping
[14721.38s -> 14726.50s]  and he's waiting. He's smiling. Yeah, it's me, the real Joe Biden. Not a comedy here.
[14727.77s -> 14735.40s]  And like two full minutes go by. All the actors on stage are all looking around waiting for it.
[14735.48s -> 14742.87s]  Yeah, it's Saturday Night Live. Yep. And then he just simply goes like, this is malarkey.
[14744.23s -> 14748.63s]  Everybody's fucking screams, class, everybody smiles back and forth. And then he just leaves.
[14754.60s -> 14760.71s]  It is getting him to do two things. And then, no, no, no, no. Then they all crowd together
[14760.71s -> 14763.83s]  and they're all trying to wait for each other to cue each other to say like live from New York
[14763.83s -> 14768.39s]  at Saturday night. And they all mess it up. So it's like, because Joe Biden is not like an actor or
[14768.39s -> 14774.15s]  anything. So he leans in and he's like, it goes something like this every time. No, not like that.
[14778.55s -> 14788.81s]  Live from New York, it's Saturday night. Live from New York, it's Saturday night. Live from
[14788.81s -> 14795.69s]  New York, it's Saturday night. And this is what happens. All right, everyone's clapping, everyone's
[14795.69s -> 14807.58s]  clapping. Live from New York, it's Saturday night. They never get it right. They never get it perfect.
[14808.14s -> 14822.44s]  They got to work on that. Get to a million. Upgrade the other flask. Oh shit.
[14825.93s -> 14835.98s]  Wait, is this on? Is this shit on? I can't. Oh, it is okay. All right. I need to upgrade these.
[14836.54s -> 14843.30s]  All right. Do I turn on? It's time to. Whoa, what's going on here? What's going on here? What's
[14843.30s -> 14858.57s]  going on with the red one? What happened here? Turn that off for a second. Five plus minute
[14858.57s -> 14869.82s]  political bias joke. Wait, what? Talking about Joe Biden watching Bionicle with me?
[14870.62s -> 14914.92s]  Turn it back on. Turn it on. Oh, Big Leaf Crunch is activated. Liberal Straver. We ain't getting
[14914.92s -> 14933.14s]  into this. Oh, strange flask. All right, stop. Omega Low. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.
[14933.14s -> 14938.66s]  No political talk unless we're making jokes about the way that. Unless we're making Saturday night
[14938.66s -> 14947.40s]  live themed jokes. Here's the only political talk we have on this channel. Excuse me. Excuse me.
[14948.04s -> 14960.84s]  That and. You just shut up, man. That's like the extent of the political talk on this channel.
[14961.64s -> 14968.62s]  It's me just putting my hands up and going. Excuse me. Excuse me. That's it. That's all I've ever
[14968.62s -> 14991.13s]  done. Or I've ordered like fake hamburgers as Bernie Sanders. Mitch McConnell. Yeah, but is
[14991.13s -> 14999.83s]  that political talk or is that me doing impressions of public figures? I mean that guy's a dick.
[15000.31s -> 15033.62s]  Let's be honest. I need 999,000 of these. Oh, he's getting political politics. We care about
[15033.62s -> 15040.42s]  Bionicle. Yeah, that's what really matters is the Bionicle mask of the mask, whatever it was.
[15040.98s -> 15059.46s]  Stream. All right, I need to upgrade this once because I need 999,000 of these. He's a registered
[15059.46s -> 15070.97s]  Bionicle. That sounds odd. That sounds bad to say that. That sounds weird. I don't. OK, but
[15073.99s -> 15082.26s]  registered like I got millions of these things.
[15093.58s -> 15097.34s]  I'm fucking this up. Hold on. I got it. This is very precise. I cannot mess this up.
[15106.02s -> 15113.37s]  Oh, Jesus. OK, I can't. I don't want to mess this up. Stop. Stop. I already screwed it up.
[15113.37s -> 15118.41s]  All right, I need nine. Wait, enter the big leaf crunch portal to restart your blowing adventure
[15118.41s -> 15127.32s]  with some BLC coins. What? I don't want to crunch. No, I don't want to do that.
[15128.04s -> 15143.56s]  Grease can drop exotic leaves. I'm going to start converting these. 292,000 gets you 700 of these.
[15143.56s -> 15169.03s]  I need 900,000 of these. Oh, Jesus. I need prestige. Let's go. Wait, a drill fan is the highest
[15169.03s -> 15175.61s]  thing I can get a fan. Use crunch. Use crunch. Don't prestige. Use crunch. Use crunch. Crunch it.
[15176.25s -> 15191.16s]  A crunch. I'm going to crunch. I'm going to crunch. But again, I've got one crunch coin.
[15195.29s -> 15203.21s]  Grease prestige coins reward by 200% per level. Holy shit, that's insane.
[15203.85s -> 15220.15s]  Grease the combo multiplier by 200%. Coin upgrade bought. What happened? Wait, actually reset it?
[15220.15s -> 15226.17s]  What do you mean? Actually reset? Wait, wait, wait. Hold on a minute. Somebody just said
[15226.17s -> 15241.13s]  actually reset Omega L and I remember their name popped up. They said do it. Crunch it. What? New
[15241.13s -> 15253.72s]  deal. I don't even know where I start with this. I don't even know where to start with this.
[15255.35s -> 15259.75s]  New deal. If you can get a Biden impersonator to watch the whole Bionicle movie with you with
[15259.75s -> 15263.83s]  camera on for the whole stream, the entire debt will be wiped. Don't waste this chance.
[15269.37s -> 15274.04s]  I'm seeing a lot of no deals though. I'm seeing a lot of no deals.
[15286.33s -> 15292.92s]  It has to be the real Joe Biden. Well, that's not going to happen. We can have a fun little talk
[15292.92s -> 15303.91s]  here of like, oh, that's funny. That's never going to be a reality. Make it a reality.
[15304.94s -> 15313.10s]  No. Okay. For that to be a thing, they would have to be... I think I got to have like 200,000
[15313.10s -> 15319.78s]  concurrent viewers. I got to be a 200k Andy for that to even be considered. That's not going to
[15319.78s -> 15340.06s]  happen. All right. No, that's not going to happen. He responded. Well, of course I'll watch the
[15340.06s -> 15347.80s]  Bionicle movie with German added by... Oh my God. No, we'll keep it the way it is for now.
[15352.84s -> 15357.16s]  All right. Did I really fuck this whole thing up? Is it time to... Is it end of the stream
[15357.16s -> 15383.45s]  voice right now? Don't leave us. I can't wait to watch Bionicle. Realistically, Jeremy,
[15383.45s -> 15386.73s]  who do you think is the highest ranking member of the government that has ever seen one of
[15386.73s -> 15392.70s]  your streams or videos? I mean, it's got to be... It's probably going to be something like
[15392.70s -> 15397.67s]  some random like selectmen. You know what I mean? It's got to be... It's probably like the
[15398.71s -> 15402.71s]  local like treasury secretary or something in like Nevada. I don't know. It's probably
[15402.71s -> 15415.78s]  somebody like the local level. It was definitely Dave State. All right. I think I kind of think
[15415.78s -> 15423.29s]  I'm going to call it here. Wanted to stop by for like four or five hours. I'm still in the
[15423.29s -> 15427.93s]  middle of doing a lot of things. I will have a shitload of announcements for you guys very soon.
[15429.42s -> 15435.18s]  There's at least one or two announcements and big things that we're going to talk about this next
[15435.18s -> 15446.47s]  week. Delay Danny, delay Darryl, break Andy. I'm going to go back to it. I will see you guys.
[15446.47s -> 15455.94s]  The next stream will probably end up being either probably Wednesday, Wednesday or Thursday. Keep
[15455.94s -> 15462.94s]  an eye on the ground. But I didn't want to just disappear. I wanted to come back and at least hang
[15462.94s -> 15469.02s]  out for a little while. So when I come back though, we got a lot to talk about. A lot to talk about.
[15471.42s -> 15475.50s]  Thanks for watching, as always. And I look forward to the Bionicle movie stream
[15476.14s -> 15482.12s]  next week. This game was actually pretty fun. I did not think there was going to be this much
[15482.12s -> 15490.81s]  in this game. It's a good background game. I recommend it. Is this game free? I think this
[15490.81s -> 15502.76s]  game is free. Is it free? It might be. I think it is. Yeah, I think the game is free. Cool.
[15502.76s -> 15513.70s]  It's free. So just go grab it if you want to check it out. A leaf blower revolution, leaf blower
[15514.34s -> 15526.89s]  revolution. All right. We are going to... What are we going to do? We are going to go. We're going
[15526.89s -> 15532.36s]  to raid. Who are we going to raid? Let's see. Who have we not raided in a while?
[15550.92s -> 15561.66s]  Let's raid Boxbox. It's been a long time. Boxbox is playing poker right now. I saw the gambling
[15561.66s -> 15566.94s]  and I immediately said, okay, let's go. I see poker. I see like blackjack. I see slot machines.
[15566.94s -> 15581.05s]  Let's go. Go say hello to Boxbox. Hey, tell them German985 sent you. Let's do the credits first,
[15581.05s -> 15591.85s]  though. Of course. Again, thanks for watching. Kind of just a chill stream today. Playing an
[15591.85s -> 15597.86s]  idle game. I'll see you guys on probably Wednesday. Keep an eye on the sus. It might change the
[15597.86s -> 15607.77s]  Thursday. Thanks again for your community subs. Everybody that's subbing and everyone that's
[15607.77s -> 15614.63s]  given money. I know a lot of people have given lots of money. Even today, too. Just huge, huge
