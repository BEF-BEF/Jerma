[22.84s -> 33.43s]  Oh sorry. Hi guys. It's fucking early. It's too hot. I can't, I can't drink this coffee.
[39.91s -> 45.83s]  All right. What time is it? It's time to go, right? I'm good. I thought it was just an Iron Man game.
[46.47s -> 51.75s]  Sure. Just an Iron Man game. We're here. We're here. I've got to, I've got to be quiet though.
[52.31s -> 58.63s]  Because everybody, everybody in the fucking house is sleeping right now. So I can't like be loud.
[59.59s -> 81.21s]  I've got to contain my joy. I can't be loud. Loud joke time? No. This shit is fucking,
[81.21s -> 87.75s]  I seriously like made this too hot. This is the Nintendo, yeah, this is the official Nintendo
[87.75s -> 97.11s]  direct robe. I have to look this cool. It's like a fucking baked potato. What the fuck?
[97.83s -> 104.86s]  Do I care about Nintendo? Yeah, I do. I have a Switch. It's literally in my bedroom. I play it
[104.94s -> 114.30s]  all the time. Welcome to day three. Do I really? Yeah, I was playing Slay the Spire on it like
[116.46s -> 123.45s]  16 hours ago, whatever it was, like two nights ago. Two nights ago. Look at this hair back here.
[124.33s -> 142.58s]  It's disgusting. What time is it in Vegas? It's 9 a.m. Well, almost 9 a.m. Do I play Smash? No,
[142.58s -> 147.93s]  I don't. I'm not, I'm not good enough. I got my ass kicked way too many times. Actually,
[147.93s -> 155.19s]  it was like three times online and I decided I'm not doing this ever again. It shut me off
[155.19s -> 163.64s]  with the game for the rest of my life. I do think it's a great game though. I got juggled around.
[165.03s -> 169.19s]  It's actually Italics and I played co-op together and we went in. We were like,
[169.19s -> 172.71s]  we practiced for a little bit. We're like, yeah, let's go. I'm ready to fucking go for it.
[173.83s -> 179.27s]  We're going to go online. We're going to try to like really win games. We got just so stomped so
[179.27s -> 183.86s]  badly. Like three or four games in a row. We just were getting juggled around,
[183.86s -> 186.90s]  thrown. It was just like embarrassing. And we just looked at each other. We were just like,
[191.51s -> 193.75s]  I think I was the first person to say something. I think it was just like,
[195.54s -> 202.10s]  hey, I don't like, you good? You look good? He's like, yeah. I'm like, yeah, I'm good.
[202.90s -> 207.06s]  We just never played it ever again. And he got controllers for it too. He was like completely
[207.06s -> 212.42s]  prepared for it. He was like, I'm going to get the game cube controllers. And we just,
[212.90s -> 219.74s]  it just wasn't, it was not good. It was bad. I'm, yeah, I am being too loud, but whatever.
[219.74s -> 230.87s]  Switch to the Nintendo stream. Is it coming up right now? Just watch it. I mean, it's about,
[230.87s -> 239.10s]  it's going to transition over right now. Yeah, we're good. I also heard through some,
[240.31s -> 246.95s]  I don't know how reliable sources. I don't think I'm allowed to stream things that are not on the
[246.95s -> 260.95s]  official Twitch broadcast. So I think the AMD stream may have been illegal. So don't tell anybody.
[260.95s -> 270.70s]  All right, here we go. Here comes the Nintendo direct. I'm excited. You're excited. I'm excited
[270.70s -> 276.78s]  as I can be waking up 15 minutes ago, 20 minutes ago. I thought that was my browser for a second.

[1988.15s -> 1993.10s]  i'll give you some parting advice what the hell
[1994.54s -> 1999.70s]  legioness and a legion are perfectly well i can't stream it i think like they're two parts
[2005.13s -> 2011.21s]  and when half of that body is about to die the legion's survival instincts kick in to save it
[2012.09s -> 2020.20s]  no way there's no way this looks crazy it's a long shot but it's the only shot we have
[2020.20s -> 2030.78s]  it's all up to you my friend a blessing from the legion maybe i should say a curse we can't turn
[2030.78s -> 2046.87s]  back now yes why don't you just let them win uh is there ever a scenario where it's just like
[2046.87s -> 2052.36s]  yeah just let just let the aliens win what we got like we can't beat them just let them win and then
[2052.36s -> 2096.06s]  have something else happen destroy all humans yeah oh wishy it's like the original um like
[2096.06s -> 2104.73s]  gangsters game i remember that game i think it was called actually i think it was called gangsters
[2104.73s -> 2115.05s]  death by our hands is not an honor they have earned they deserve something much worse
[2116.33s -> 2127.00s]  even with this stone at my command this may not be a battle we can win
[2129.99s -> 2132.95s]  magneto that's still we can beat it keep fighting
[2133.03s -> 2143.50s]  oh this is ultimate alliance three isn't it i actually haven't excited to play this
[2156.68s -> 2161.40s]  i got some i might have some unpopular opinions here i do no maybe i don't but they probably are
[2163.98s -> 2169.91s]  turn down your particle effects they don't have it just gets in the way it's like overwatch syndrome
[2169.91s -> 2174.31s]  you know what i mean i don't just turn them down is it really doesn't really care that much

[2513.32s -> 2518.66s]  excited for at this e3 and it feels strange maybe it's because like not very much was really shown
[2518.66s -> 2523.54s]  here all the triple a studios have made the same constant conflict game and if we get there's all
[2523.54s -> 2559.69s]  the stuff that like seems pretty cool there it is what is that three something three the game
[2559.69s -> 2577.03s]  three the game all right i don't know why i thought that was conquer i was gonna say why would
[2577.03s -> 2605.86s]  they not have something more substantial for this mario maker 2 very cool no actual gameplay of what
[2609.14s -> 2618.66s]  oh donkey kong country 4 donkey kong country 4 do it or like a like a tropical freeze

[2660.31s -> 2664.92s]  wow i didn't think this was gonna happen i really didn't
[2666.10s -> 2679.37s]  i can't fucking believe it i thought this was bullshit wow they actually did it
[2680.01s -> 2740.84s]  i can't fucking believe it i i smash brothers and banjo kazooie wow that obviously wasn't duck
[2740.84s -> 2747.16s]  hunt silhouette was it it's tell us tuned for more information about dlc in the future

[2761.72s -> 2766.14s]  before we end this direct i actually have one more thing to show you
[2768.60s -> 2775.22s]  thank you very much for watching until next time come on what do we got it better be metroid
[2775.22s -> 2796.36s]  thank you very much thank you i still can't believe banjo kazooie is in smash bros
[2823.03s -> 2846.52s]  i didn't play breath of the wild did i just spoil everything oh this
[2846.52s -> 2855.40s]  i thought this was like dlc the sequel it's not dlc it's a sequel full-blown sequel oh damn all
[2855.40s -> 2864.60s]  right that's it extra cool shit like floating island dude is that it that's what the first one
[2864.60s -> 2869.96s]  was missing would have been a 10 out of 10 that's awesome very cool that's so far away though you
[2869.96s -> 2880.06s]  can just feel it oh yeah yeah is it do the joke no i can't look i can't recycle the same like i'm
[2880.06s -> 2885.50s]  pretending to be on the podcast joke i've done it like three times in three days for each day
[2885.50s -> 2895.34s]  there's been an e3 i've pretended to be on somebody else's show i i'll tell you i did
[2897.27s -> 2903.18s]  banjo b and it's smash means that like anything's possible now they can put anybody in there now i
[2903.18s -> 2908.38s]  mean you got microsoft had to have had something to do with that so i who knows who knows who the
[2908.38s -> 2920.92s]  hell you'll see there in a couple years sans i don't know about that i don't know about that
[2926.68s -> 2933.91s]  dude the joke no uh i just i just closed out the browser it's not here anymore
[2937.51s -> 2945.16s]  all right let me so hold on it has been let me give you my total my complete assessment here
[2945.16s -> 2965.96s]  because this is now an assessment stream here we go okay so this is this is my e this is what i
[2965.96s -> 2974.10s]  think about e3 amd but they're lightning fast processors and they're extremely affordable
[2974.10s -> 2984.65s]  graphics processing units i'll tell you one thing that i am disappointed on and i'm disappointed
[2984.65s -> 2989.21s]  with this every single year that is a nintendo direct for e3 or anytime nintendo does anything
[2989.21s -> 2998.63s]  where they announce anything no wario where no like actual real new wario where every year i'm
[2998.63s -> 3006.60s]  just like are they gonna are they gonna do it and they just don't so they did that game in wario
[3006.60s -> 3013.40s]  game for the wii u and it was stupid it was like 16 games although it was just whatever it wasn't
[3013.40s -> 3019.66s]  really that it was pretty bad then but it's been like 10 years since it's been like a real wario
[3019.66s -> 3029.06s]  where and i those are my favorite fucking games that nintendo's probably ever made they did they
[3029.06s -> 3038.54s]  did what the one on ds wario where is dead wario where gold no but i mean like a but like console
[3041.72s -> 3053.98s]  wario where is shit oh he is the shit i want like a full-on wario where switch you know how much
[3053.98s -> 3058.39s]  fun shit they could do with those two little controllers they could have like you could have
[3058.39s -> 3065.51s]  so many different things with the two just like they did with the wii and the screen you could
[3065.51s -> 3072.15s]  they got a touch screen and they have motion controllers rhythm heaven that would be no yeah
[3072.15s -> 3083.58s]  anything like that it would be good nobody buys them i buy them isn't that enough that should be
[3083.58s -> 3096.89s]  enough one guy that's get one sale from me every time nintendo that's a guarantee dude if there was
[3096.89s -> 3103.08s]  a collector's edition for wario where switch and it was like i don't know like a wario mask
[3104.52s -> 3116.68s]  and like caffeine pills or something like i get it he's drinking pac-man's brains he killed but
[3116.68s -> 3128.02s]  yeah like i fucking murdered pac-man and i turned him into a drink no this is this is a novelty
[3128.02s -> 3138.58s]  device that came for fun um no no more heroes three uh looks i don't know how it looks because
[3138.58s -> 3145.54s]  we don't get to see it uh no more heroes three uh was a big fan of the first two i played the
[3145.54s -> 3153.11s]  shit out of him in college i'm sure it'll be all right i'm sure it'll be good uh what else is there
[3153.11s -> 3159.24s]  watch dogs three lots of threes lots of threes that i think would be fun watch dogs three is
[3159.24s -> 3163.64s]  in this weird space where i think it'll be fun for like 12 hours and then i'll never play it ever
[3163.64s -> 3176.74s]  again which i don't know the minecraft yeah diablo minecraft i will play that animal crossing i'll
[3176.74s -> 3184.23s]  play that dragon builders i'll probably play that for like 40 minutes and then realize it is way
[3184.23s -> 3190.06s]  too complicated for me and then i've got to go like file some like reports or something like taxes
[3190.06s -> 3202.71s]  and i won't do it chivalry 2 i'm not i'm like i'm not that i'm not excited for chivalry 2
[3202.71s -> 3208.94s]  i just it's not like i think it's not good i just don't it's not doing it for me i feel like i
[3208.94s -> 3221.21s]  played mordhau and chivalry 2 would have to be way better than mordhau for me to care about it
[3221.21s -> 3226.41s]  terraria yeah i have i gotta play that i've got to play like i'm just i there's so many things to do
[3233.32s -> 3239.40s]  delton ring yeah it's hard to get excited about a game that is in okay remember when securo got
[3239.40s -> 3246.60s]  teased and it was just like a close-up of his prosthetic it was just like that's it it's hard
[3246.60s -> 3250.12s]  to be like oh i can't wait to play that we didn't even know what it was it was like i can't wait to
[3250.12s -> 3255.58s]  play with that guy's bones i thought it was a guy's bones so it's hard to know what's he going to
[3255.58s -> 3265.32s]  even be like yeah it was a close-up of his prosthetic and it was like crunching i thought
[3265.48s -> 3279.69s]  i didn't even know it was prosthetic did i download roller champions i did not banjo all right
[3279.69s -> 3289.11s]  here's the thing about banjo kazooie that means this is gonna there's gonna be and okay i really
[3289.11s -> 3296.46s]  hope this doesn't happen but it's very possible i mean they might be like a nintendo and microsoft
[3296.46s -> 3302.22s]  collaboration where they make banjo kazooie 3 that's a great scenario what a fucking awesome
[3302.22s -> 3310.94s]  scenario potentially more likely is microsoft rides this hype train from smash brothers
[3310.94s -> 3320.58s]  and makes nuts and bolts 2 i'm it's jet that's probably a real scenario i just it's possible
[3320.58s -> 3329.00s]  there's an equal and opposite potential way to go here or we'll get like a banjo kazooie mobile
[3329.00s -> 3339.70s]  card game or yeah or remastered banjo kazooie 1 and 2 the the ultimate scenario is the microsoft
[3339.70s -> 3346.06s]  decides to ride this train all the way up and makes banjo kazooie 3 but i don't even
[3346.06s -> 3350.22s]  people get so excited about banjo kazooie 3 it's not even saying people anymore right it's like
[3350.94s -> 3358.86s]  that studio has been i mean even if it was banjo kazooie 3 it's like oh i wish there was a new
[3358.86s -> 3362.78s]  game in the chrono series chrono trigger chrono cross i can't wait for the next chrono none of
[3362.78s -> 3367.94s]  the people are even still there it would be different it wouldn't be the same and we essentially
[3367.94s -> 3373.54s]  all locked ourselves in this like nostalgia box for like two decades just like let me out let me
[3373.54s -> 3377.70s]  out i can't wait to see i can't no and then finally you get to see it it's like some of
[3377.70s -> 3385.51s]  these people don't even work here anymore because it's been it's been like too long that's the one
[3385.51s -> 3390.47s]  problem all these sequels and all these things that we like can't wait to see it's been a very
[3390.47s -> 3399.43s]  long time so it's like somebody writing a series of books and then halfway through somebody else
[3399.43s -> 3405.86s]  comes in and finishes that person's story it's like all right i it's it's i guess it's the same
[3405.86s -> 3422.71s]  characters but it can be tough though and a lot of people have trouble with it game of thrones
[3427.26s -> 3436.66s]  didn't want to say anything that happened to hitchhiker's guide it's actually happened
[3436.66s -> 3444.18s]  quite a few times throughout history why do i look like a character from greece
[3445.32s -> 3458.57s]  because this is my e3 persona what time is it that's my phone's dead uh what are you what
[3458.57s -> 3465.96s]  am i using my hair uh i use shampoo uh and then i rinse it out this is my hair look at let me tell
[3465.96s -> 3473.96s]  you something my hair looks like this for like maybe two or three hours and then it just goes
[3473.96s -> 3488.09s]  crazy i use conditioner not every single day but i do i mean i think that the banjo part of the
[3488.09s -> 3493.37s]  name is pretty much enough right just always thought of different kind of banjo one what do
[3493.37s -> 3503.29s]  women i want to go in by too fast am i graying no i probably will not have gray hair ever i turn
[3503.29s -> 3509.29s]  33 this year i mean 35 what's a lie turn 34 i turned 34 this year and i'm i got no gray
[3509.29s -> 3520.10s]  none i'll be bald before it turns gray i'll be yeah i'll be bald before it turns completely gray
[3521.37s -> 3530.55s]  there's plenty of time there is a lot of time left uh but anyway so we got nintendo i mean
[3530.55s -> 3534.87s]  whatever they decide to do hopefully somebody cares about it and we get something fun
[3536.23s -> 3545.80s]  obviously this is the one thing that all right so so sakurai is has his hands on banjo and he's
[3545.80s -> 3552.65s]  making banjo and banjo looks like really really great and really cool but like he might make it
[3552.65s -> 3558.01s]  too good and then like uh microsoft gets it and they like don't make it right it's like
[3558.01s -> 3565.43s]  so it'll be sonic boom when microsoft makes it that's what you should be concerned with
[3565.43s -> 3582.31s]  because of those saying yeah sakurai is seriously like he's so talented at making characters and
[3582.31s -> 3590.07s]  making them the way that they like really should be right every time a new character is introduced
[3590.07s -> 3595.43s]  in smash you're like oh my holy shit i can't wait to see this because it's going to be so true and
[3595.43s -> 3600.26s]  so awesome to what the source material was there'll be little like easter eggs with the
[3600.26s -> 3608.30s]  moves they do a great job they do it better than than like the people that made the game did
[3608.94s -> 3615.96s]  does sakurai should just make every game we haven't figured out cloning yet just clone him
[3615.96s -> 3620.84s]  a hundred times and just have him make every single video game and it'll probably be good
[3629.93s -> 3640.01s]  he works he works himself to the bone yeah he does and i mean he really does they have to and
[3640.01s -> 3646.81s]  do understand flavor when it comes to characters the actual people who own the ip forget yeah
[3646.81s -> 3651.45s]  typically i mean well think about it if you have a character that's from franchises from 15 years
[3651.45s -> 3656.97s]  ago and nobody on your development staff has ever even worked with it before and you start
[3656.97s -> 3662.44s]  and you make something else with that character it's just like oh i guess we do still have this
[3662.44s -> 3666.44s]  character to work with and then you give it to sakurai and he makes he like makes it look easy
[3667.24s -> 3673.34s]  but no that's really that's really cool to see that this actual collaboration between
[3674.22s -> 3680.68s]  because this shit you this shit that gets so tiring everyone like in constant conflict with
[3680.68s -> 3690.74s]  each other console wars get out here this is my exclusive motherfucker i'm supposed to be quiet
[3690.74s -> 3693.78s]  this is we got to see a for the first time in a long time we got to see
[3694.58s -> 3710.07s]  conflict resolved we got mic Microsoft and Nintendo no conflict that's all i wanted
[3710.07s -> 3721.18s]  i didn't realize that sony was streaming like right now what is this click the link
[3725.26s -> 3734.10s]  vermin ty two is getting a versus mode rats the rats wear the rats what is that actually
[3734.10s -> 3744.86s]  part of the article that's fucking funny the rats the rats wear the rats i mean that
[3745.50s -> 3754.06s]  it could mean anything that's that's versus mode though that's pretty funny that's pretty cool but
[3754.06s -> 3758.38s]  um do i have any more info up here in here in my brain that i would like to get out let it yeah
[3759.34s -> 3767.53s]  uh square enix i just i'll be honest i just i just don't get it i just don't get i and i'm not i'm
[3767.53s -> 3771.45s]  not saying that i don't think those games are good i just don't get it i just don't get them
[3771.45s -> 3774.97s]  like i told you last night i was kind of sitting there not knowing what to do or say
[3775.98s -> 3784.10s]  just because i made the the comment about it's like oh it's like turning on a movie 45 minutes
[3784.10s -> 3789.45s]  in and just being like who the fuck are all these people that's like okay that's like
[3789.93s -> 3793.77s]  going like lord of the rings right these are some of these games and some of these
[3793.77s -> 3800.10s]  series are in like the 10th or 11th iteration now this is dragon quest 11 and i know they're
[3800.10s -> 3805.22s]  they're different from story story but still i mean it's like some of these games are two or
[3805.22s -> 3810.66s]  three iterations and they have like books and novels and animes behind them it's like walking
[3810.66s -> 3816.28s]  in to a convention for one of these games where people already are all really big fans and they
[3816.28s -> 3822.84s]  already know everything that's going on and and you're in like like a super mario t-shirt
[3822.84s -> 3826.28s]  and you're like i thought this was this is not super mario and they're like what are you talking
[3826.28s -> 3831.43s]  about oh but they would probably be happy to be like oh i love super mario but then you'd be like
[3831.43s -> 3838.63s]  i don't know who your character is and i would feel i'd be like i don't i don't understand it's
[3838.63s -> 3848.42s]  hard it's hard to distinguish these just because i don't really follow any of them i look like a
[3848.42s -> 3856.38s]  mob boss no i look like i look like the mob boss's fucking sleazy accountant i'm a guy that's like
[3856.38s -> 3866.68s]  yeah man what do you need i can make that work for you but that's not to say any of those
[3866.68s -> 3870.20s]  franchises of games aren't any good it's just i don't get them i don't understand
[3872.34s -> 3876.82s]  watching a three it's like watching a three-part trilogy movie in the last movie and not knowing
[3876.82s -> 3883.02s]  any of the characters names but some of the things they did show were interesting
[3883.74s -> 3888.14s]  uh but i don't really have much to say about it anyways uh what else we got we had ubisoft
[3893.13s -> 3898.97s]  i don't remember anything from ubisoft i don't not one thing i remember okay hey guys i remember
[3898.97s -> 3910.30s]  the color of tod's jacket that's it oh watch dogs watch dogs free right okay all right watch
[3910.30s -> 3919.72s]  dogs free no that was bethesda so no i'm like putting bethesda into a different stage because
[3919.72s -> 3930.36s]  i got that was bethesda with the problem there okay so not ubisoft bethesda i just know the
[3930.36s -> 3934.52s]  color of tod's jacket that's why i was putting him putting him in with ubisoft what color was
[3934.52s -> 3946.06s]  the jacket it was like a it was like a taupe it was like a green beige did i get that wrong

[3954.50s -> 3965.61s]  olive somebody give me a screenshot is it did i get that wrong was that conference that bad
[3966.17s -> 3972.70s]  that i don't even know the color of tod's jacket is the most important thing what even was in

[3985.56s -> 3999.32s]  doom there was doom doom eternal all right that's cool what else oh yeah there was a couple there
[3999.32s -> 4014.22s]  was that that death loop game yeah let me see is this did i get it wrong i got it wrong i'm not
[4014.22s -> 4035.54s]  paying attention to what matters here why did i think it was like an olive color like a dark olive
[4035.54s -> 4047.21s]  green like taupe but you know having no saudi just it feels weird it feels like oh i wish i could see
[4047.21s -> 4053.13s]  some of that stuff but we don't all right this is here's another potentially unpopular opinion
[4053.85s -> 4058.33s]  follow these tonight today it's it's it's nine o'clock ten o'clock in the morning not tonight
[4058.33s -> 4069.45s]  my brain is just fried um do we really need an e3 every single year do we really need that
[4071.22s -> 4082.02s]  not really right why don't we have like a mini e3 like e2 e3 could be like the big one whenever
[4082.02s -> 4087.54s]  it has stuff to show and e2 could be so the electronic entertainment expo how about just
[4087.54s -> 4099.86s]  like the the electronic expo does it have to be e3 the intent yeah look at some of these companies
[4099.86s -> 4106.78s]  nintendo already does this sony decided this year that they weren't going to do this
[4107.86s -> 4115.08s]  nintendo decided years ago that they weren't going to really do that anymore that's not
[4115.08s -> 4127.40s]  entertaining no they should just call it the the eae the electronic ads expo because i'll tell you
[4128.36s -> 4133.80s]  i really did feel like it i really did feel like we just watched a bunch of youtube pre-rolls on
[4133.80s -> 4155.99s]  some of these conferences eae it's called growing up wait what we need more gameplay demos
[4157.64s -> 4165.93s]  i just i don't know i think maybe i am getting old it's always been but i feel like there's been
[4165.93s -> 4171.51s]  more to talk about but what i like i like is how like some of these indie games and indie companies
[4171.51s -> 4177.35s]  are really starting to kind of flow up here and start to outshine some of these triple a games
[4177.35s -> 4183.03s]  and companies doesn't everybody say that devolver's devolver didn't even have a conference
[4183.67s -> 4189.99s]  like three or four years ago they that that's new that's not it's not like sony microsoft nintendo
[4189.99s -> 4197.91s]  devolver digital so it's interesting to see that there are some companies that are starting to
[4197.91s -> 4209.86s]  actually come up here amd yeah they didn't have a car no but i mean like like a present a presentation
[4209.86s -> 4218.90s]  like they had a presentation but maybe but maybe we just don't need an e3 every single year like
[4218.90s -> 4229.48s]  maybe like stuff like the nintendo directs are the future but i mean next year this will this won't
[4229.48s -> 4237.45s]  be an e2 next year it'll be an e3 they'll be i would assume we'll get an announcement from sony
[4237.45s -> 4242.73s]  there'll be consoles next year that they're showing it will get a full-on completely just
[4243.85s -> 4250.81s]  the microsoft xbox uh what is it called what's the what's the name of the thing the stelares the
[4250.81s -> 4260.63s]  xbox stelares the microsoft stelares what is it called the scarlet the microsoft scarlet
[4262.65s -> 4267.69s]  there'll be that'll be on a desk in the middle of the stage it's gonna be a little circle it's
[4267.69s -> 4274.22s]  gonna be as big as like an amazon echo it'll be this big a donut will be bigger than this thing
[4274.22s -> 4286.87s]  i'm just making a prediction here a donut's gonna be bigger than the the scarlet how is that gonna
[4286.87s -> 4293.48s]  run anything it might be i'm just telling you it could be it's gonna be it's gonna be a little
[4293.48s -> 4299.13s]  thing in the middle it's gonna and they're gonna sell it like it's cortana whatever the thing is
[4299.13s -> 4312.70s]  called the halo halo what's the halo person bed audit i'll buy it if you're right good by the way
[4312.70s -> 4321.69s]  i love i love this i love like the they just they didn't nintendo just those with oh that transition
[4321.69s -> 4332.14s]  just like and now you know how many times they probably recorded that snap to get that perfect
[4332.14s -> 4339.75s]  there was an audio engineer sitting in a room for potentially two to three straight weeks hiring
[4339.75s -> 4345.96s]  different people to come like snap and like mixing it to get it perfect months even yeah
[4350.06s -> 4363.85s]  that was the original snap of john nintendo oh my god yeah they he snapped at a at a at a
[4363.85s -> 4376.10s]  investor meeting one time and they picked it up through the phone 1948 1962 yeah that's not even
[4376.10s -> 4382.66s]  actually a a snap yeah if it's a foley artist yeah like somebody said they they probably like
[4383.22s -> 4388.58s]  squished a bag of carrots and like mixed it together with like somebody dropping a book on
[4388.58s -> 4394.84s]  the ground to get that and they pulled one out like oh like get that little part right here when
[4394.84s -> 4401.21s]  like the carrots squished right there just like it's a foley artist a foley artist that's what
[4401.21s -> 4415.30s]  they do i don't think that's a human snap it probably isn't audio editing is a ton of fun
[4415.30s -> 4421.45s]  it really is audio editing is like some of the most fun you'll ever have uh um what time is it
[4421.45s -> 4425.77s]  we're not we don't have to go just yet but i have to dry i because kim knew that i was getting up
[4425.77s -> 4430.73s]  this early she's like oh can you drive me here and i'm like yeah i can drive you here so i'm
[4430.73s -> 4440.79s]  gonna drive kim somewhere because she knew i was gonna be awake yeah i'm not usually awake at

[4572.30s -> 4577.82s]  oh you got up this afternoon at eight o'clock that's how you can tell i fucking stay up really late
[4577.82s -> 4589.13s]  eight p.m is like in the middle of the afternoon i stayed up all night i was thinking about doing
[4589.13s -> 4592.89s]  that because i didn't want to miss this because i really did not want to tell everybody that i
[4592.89s -> 4596.49s]  was going to be here at nine o'clock in the morning and just not show up so i was like fuck
[4596.49s -> 4600.65s]  i really don't want to like sleep through an alarm or something should i just stay up the whole time
[4600.65s -> 4607.74s]  and then like come and sit down here i thought about it no i i slept i did i would have been
[4607.74s -> 4632.26s]  delirious i didn't well why didn't you should have gone to bed you don't want to see that
[4633.83s -> 4638.97s]  oh you should do that i've done that before and it's i just okay do you remember the first
[4639.85s -> 4646.74s]  15 to 20 minutes of this stream go watch it this it was only that was an hour and 20 minutes ago
[4646.74s -> 4651.38s]  but do you remember go watch that i was sitting here just turning the stream on just barely had
[4651.38s -> 4659.42s]  woken up and i'm just like i was weird i was a weirdo i couldn't really make any references
[4659.42s -> 4663.58s]  my brain was just like starting to turn on okay here's here's my operating set you know let me
[4663.58s -> 4669.59s]  give you a good example here i have a really really really good computer up here it works
[4670.23s -> 4675.59s]  i mean maybe uh i might be kind of full my hard drive might be failing a little but it's still
[4675.59s -> 4680.62s]  really good it still works just fine and the graphics card works everything works but i have
[4680.62s -> 4685.34s]  like a seven to ten minute boot up sequence like if you turned your computer on it took like 15
[4685.34s -> 4694.42s]  minutes to turn on but once it's on it's it goes so i can't get an ssd i have a hard drive up here
[4694.42s -> 4702.38s]  i have a i can't what am i going to take my brain out now some of you guys some of you guys were
[4702.38s -> 4707.21s]  born with an ssd in your head and that's good that's great you can get up in the morning and
[4707.21s -> 4710.97s]  bang you're ready to go some of you guys can it also takes me like 20 minutes to like boot the
[4710.97s -> 4718.76s]  computer down it takes i have so many viruses you know when somebody has like a shit load of viruses
[4718.76s -> 4725.02s]  then it takes like 20 minutes for the computer to turn off and turn on i'm like your grandfather's
[4725.02s -> 4731.06s]  computer i have a bunch of viruses in my like operating system that i like i can't get rid of
[4732.02s -> 4743.38s]  too much bloatware but i got too many toolbars i've got too many tabs open too that's another
[4743.38s -> 4749.91s]  thing i have like a hundred firefox tabs open with an operating system from fucking windows vista
[4750.63s -> 4765.59s]  still using internet explorer but it takes me a long time to boot up a very long i still not
[4765.59s -> 4769.99s]  boot completely boot up so that's why when you watch the stream for the first 20 minutes
[4771.45s -> 4778.25s]  i am fucking useless absolutely useless i i better not ever in my whole life ever have a job where
[4778.25s -> 4783.85s]  i got to get up in the morning and like like be like ready to pull the lever you know what i mean
[4783.85s -> 4790.50s]  like i'll miss it by like a nanosecond you know what i mean i i don't i can't have that all right
[4790.50s -> 4795.46s]  here's your job or your job is to get in here at exactly 6 a.m you sit right here and you wake up
[4795.46s -> 4798.90s]  at 5 30 in the morning you got to get here and you sit and you get all your job your job is just to
[4798.90s -> 4806.65s]  pull the lever at 5 10 exactly i'll miss it that's the whole that's all i have to do i don't have to
[4806.65s -> 4810.97s]  do anything i'm the person that turns on the factory you know what i mean i just have to like
[4810.97s -> 4815.53s]  turn it on and catch it when it's going to its next uh like the transmission like it's going to
[4815.53s -> 4820.55s]  like a ninja drive i have to like catch it that's how you turn on every factory i just got to pull
[4820.55s -> 4828.22s]  that lever that's it i wouldn't be able to do it i would i would like fucking pass out at like 5 8
[4828.78s -> 4833.42s]  and at 5 10 when it's supposed to be pulled i would like snap out of it and pull it at like 5
[4833.50s -> 4838.54s]  11 like the factory turn off and like i would it would be 600 million dollars in damages to that
[4838.54s -> 4851.85s]  place what scp are you talking about what scp am i do i have to contain i gotta catch it at
[4851.85s -> 4857.13s]  the right second i'm the guy i'm the guy in that factory that is like catching the scp i have to
[4857.13s -> 4862.89s]  do everything in very in tandem i'm the guy that lets him out you play all those games holy shit i
[4862.89s -> 4870.57s]  can't believe scp 666 got out of his containment facility it's because germa 985 woke up too late
[4870.57s -> 4875.75s]  and like got in there and fell asleep at his desk i'm that person that has that happened
[4875.75s -> 4890.49s]  but anyways what else was there microsoft uh scp isn't a game no i know i'm just saying like the
[4890.49s -> 4903.67s]  the game that you've played based on your favorite uh certain service certain protocol monster i
[4903.67s -> 4917.13s]  don't know whatever the hell what is it called what does scp stand for secure contain protect
[4917.13s -> 4932.76s]  what did i say secure secure socket what ssl secure secure uh socket encryption go to a beard
[4932.76s -> 4937.00s]  i can't it's not possible it just looks like shit it already does this is where it's where it starts
[4937.00s -> 4954.57s]  and then it looks horrible in like 12 hours service certain protocol that's close uh but
[4954.57s -> 4967.11s]  anyways microsoft games as a service is going to be a reality sooner than you think that's pretty
[4967.11s -> 4973.11s]  much what you need to know from that is that games as a service is happening sooner than you probably
[4973.11s -> 4989.69s]  think senior citizen pea pants i'm so glad that pea pants is going to be a thing on this channel
[4989.69s -> 4995.21s]  it's been a thing between friends me and my friends especially burger boy for like a decade
[4995.93s -> 4999.93s]  more than that almost no no when did smite come out 2012 2013
[5001.50s -> 5005.90s]  since smite like released and was able to go into like private rooms it's been a thing that we call
[5005.90s -> 5020.36s]  each other journal cries when did i cry i love this mug you get it on amazon just type in type
[5020.36s -> 5030.89s]  this in and then put mug after it you'll find it pretty good you find a couple of them why am i
[5030.89s -> 5039.48s]  drinking this like i'm drinking a goblet like why am i holding it like this you're breathtaking
[5039.48s -> 5052.71s]  you're breathtaking that's it right can i tell you that i feel bad about that because that is
[5052.71s -> 5060.39s]  the meme of the 2019 e3 conferences that's the that's the meme that's the thing that like everyone
[5060.39s -> 5067.66s]  is so glad that they got to see and i covered it up i actually was like covering that when it was
[5067.66s -> 5081.30s]  happening so if you watched my version of e3 you didn't get to see the like your breathtaking
[5081.30s -> 5086.10s]  like the the live meme i like i've ruined it i covered it i like literally covered him up
[5088.15s -> 5100.46s]  and twitch highlighted it yeah twitch tweeted it yeah if people whatever maybe we'll get some
[5100.46s -> 5113.00s]  new friends link it it's if you just go to official twitch tv twitter scroll down will
[5113.00s -> 5125.22s]  you find it the guy who said that is getting a free copy of cyberpunk collector's edition what
[5125.22s -> 5139.00s]  do you mean the guy who said what the guy who's but what the guy oh the oh the breathtaking guy
[5139.80s -> 5150.15s]  oh well i we got when we talk about guy there's a lot of one guys on this channel when i see like
[5150.15s -> 5163.21s]  oh the guy i'm thinking of what one guy where it is a real life one guy scenario the guy which one
[5163.21s -> 5174.06s]  guy there's one guy is getting cyberpunk that's that's fun that's fun i'm glad people can have
[5174.06s -> 5184.89s]  a good time keanu reeves it's key they're giving it to keanu reeves they loved that segment so much
[5184.89s -> 5196.31s]  that keanu reeves is getting a collector's edition uh but i gotta i gotta skedaddle here in a few
[5196.31s -> 5206.55s]  minutes so who won okay that yeah i got that up there who won e3 all of us because we get to
[5206.55s -> 5232.62s]  experience uh probably nintendo um micro okay microsoft won in like a buy the stock sense because
[5232.62s -> 5239.66s]  of the new console right so microsoft won okay if there's two if there's like people that like
[5239.66s -> 5245.50s]  video games and then like businessmen in suits that trade stocks back and forth microsoft won
[5245.50s -> 5256.81s]  to these guys and probably i i mean nintendo just had stuff that i didn't have the most stuff that
[5256.81s -> 5264.66s]  i was like oh oh that didn't happen that many other times so just judging by my oh and ah meter
[5264.66s -> 5273.34s]  i would have to say it was probably nintendo watch dogs three looks really really fun
[5274.06s -> 5281.98s]  but i the the oh and ah meter was uh higher i think for stuff that nintendo showed and it was
[5281.98s -> 5288.63s]  not that long either who had the most disappointing conference i like the whole thing was just kind of
[5289.35s -> 5295.93s]  disappointing is not really the right word but nothing really like nothing really was like grabbing
[5297.50s -> 5305.32s]  but yeah but that bethesda bethesda spent like the first 30 or 40 minutes talking about how
[5306.04s -> 5313.35s]  how much they like like love the community and like fallout 76 and look at the hey hey we're
[5313.35s -> 5319.75s]  like don't you like us we like you fallout 76 we like you you know have you heard about this game
[5319.75s -> 5332.60s]  fallout 76 we really like you so they just and fall they've had so many missteps they realized
[5332.60s -> 5343.61s]  everyone started hating them yeah let's just hope that they kind of turn it around here it looks
[5343.61s -> 5349.93s]  like it looks like they're trying it does with some of these things doom is really the thing
[5349.93s -> 5360.12s]  that's like doom has doom is like a canoe right and like like they just sit the the creator of
[5360.12s -> 5368.76s]  doom eternal is like sitting in a canoe and he has like 6 000 pounds in that canoe and he has to
[5368.76s -> 5380.17s]  fucking like row it across an ocean worst analogy what i did that how is that not true
[5380.89s -> 5389.27s]  he the dude that they got like a fucking boat full of like stuff that people don't think is cool
[5390.34s -> 5396.94s]  and then they've got doom which is people think is awesome that's a bet you know i'm gonna i veto
[5396.94s -> 5411.91s]  that that's the best analogy of 2019 uh i veto everyone in the chat sorry room eternal i think
[5411.91s -> 5426.58s]  just dance uh will probably i just realized just dance is madden this new madden damn okay um
[5429.70s -> 5440.65s]  what else was there i think that's it what am i gonna do a just dance stream i would do a just
[5440.65s -> 5445.40s]  dance stream no i wouldn't i'm not gonna say this number because it's way too high and i don't know
[5445.40s -> 5454.86s]  some somebody somebody might just like fucking find a way so i'm not gonna say it i never
[5454.94s -> 5466.23s]  underestimate people in this community i won't i don't i don't do that derma lied about just
[5466.23s -> 5469.35s]  dance derma didn't even make a statement about just dance he just said it was madden
[5470.36s -> 5480.49s]  it's new madden uh but i think that's um worsted out i just said a guy was in a boat carrying
[5480.49s -> 5486.09s]  other like he was rowing his anchor-filled boat which was bethesda that's not an analogy that's
[5486.09s -> 5496.46s]  an analysis i said a guy was in a boat and all of a sudden that's the worst analogy ever heard
[5496.46s -> 5502.38s]  an anchor-filled boat i talked about like reincarnating into harry potter today and
[5502.38s -> 5521.46s]  apparently that was that was better boats all right well uh yeah i think that's it
[5522.18s -> 5527.94s]  that's e3 the last three days have been fun to hang out with everybody hopefully you had a good
[5527.94s -> 5541.05s]  time i've got to go take kim i gotta drive kim and yeah i i'll see you guys um i'll see you guys

[5856.94s -> 5860.46s]  the only reason germany is excited for no more heroes is because he looks exactly like travis
[5860.46s -> 5865.34s]  touchdown look up the trailer right at the end when he looks into the camera it's uncanny
[5866.30s -> 5879.22s]  i do not look like travis touchdown i know i don't thank you for the five dollars though
[5879.86s -> 5891.64s]  i really appreciate it i do no i don't hey niall oren again nara niall oren thanks for the three
[5891.64s -> 5898.44s]  dolls yeah the mc from persona 5 banjo and kazooie are gonna be in the next smash things i never would
[5898.44s -> 5907.10s]  have expected a year ago no i i smacked there was a lot of rumors going around that banjo
[5907.10s -> 5913.27s]  oh banjo's in the game remember like like two years ago a year ago whatever i was like oh
[5915.67s -> 5920.07s]  bullshit and then it like got like debunked and then it got debunked again and everyone kind of
[5920.07s -> 5932.01s]  lost hope and that's really really cool it's exciting to see that but yes that is true i
[5932.01s -> 5939.11s]  never would have thought the same thing freudian weapon thanks for the 250 uh mr butt woman thanks
[5939.11s -> 5956.71s]  for the 10 bucks is a better analogy for doom is a bird uh picking up somebody no it's a though the
[5956.71s -> 5969.14s]  analogy is doom is sitting in a boat and he's rowing across a huge ocean and he has like 500
[5969.14s -> 5977.34s]  fallout 76 game discs in his boat i just made it better that's so much better okay can i like
[5977.34s -> 5985.91s]  retract that and change the joke he has like 400 he has like 200 000 fallout 76 game discs
[5987.05s -> 6002.39s]  that's better that's funny okay let's see one some one person said it was funny thank you
[6002.39s -> 6015.19s]  mr butt woman for the 10 dollars fallout 76 isn't on disc uh yes it is i remember being in best buy
[6015.19s -> 6020.63s]  and it being on the shelf and very very specifically uh there was a big display for it
[6020.63s -> 6028.65s]  and there were a ton of sealed packages and it was a perfect new jenga it had not even been touched
[6029.21s -> 6038.18s]  right next to it was red dead redemption 2 and that shit was empty there were two discs like
[6038.18s -> 6054.06s]  little disc boxes things to bring up to the front so put them in the boat they're just empty boxes
[6054.06s -> 6061.02s]  yeah but they they they they personify a disc they're in a case and they're on a display
[6061.82s -> 6076.63s]  cardboard discs with codes yeah they're gonna be any more discs anymore guys it's not gonna happen
[6076.63s -> 6084.84s]  when we're gonna we're gonna go to completely to onto a disc not no i mean like a like a solid
[6084.84s -> 6098.02s]  state drive like not like a hard disc not hard you know what i'm saying like an hdd sd guys we're
[6098.02s -> 6107.61s]  moving from disc to disc the cloud i don't think we're ready for the cloud yet computers aren't
[6107.61s -> 6112.49s]  fast enough the internet's not like good enough for cloud computing to really be worth using yet
[6112.49s -> 6125.67s]  maybe like another five to ten years maybe i don't think it's there do you remember when they when
[6125.67s -> 6130.55s]  microsoft made it a huge deal that they were gonna do cloud computing for um crackdown 3
[6131.67s -> 6134.79s]  and that never happened because they probably got halfway through development and realized
[6134.79s -> 6143.66s]  that it was not possible do you remember that crackdown 3 the buildings are all going to be
[6143.66s -> 6148.54s]  cloud computing and they go you don't even need the processing oh that didn't happen we got like
[6148.54s -> 6163.27s]  we got crackdown one reskinned they probably had ambitious plans for that with what they did
[6164.07s -> 6174.07s]  and it just wasn't there yet probably i think in another five to ten years there will be no more
[6174.07s -> 6181.35s]  consoles there will be like the microsoft login and that's it you log into microsoft
[6182.07s -> 6188.07s]  and everything's just there and you might have a little box a little small amazon echo box that
[6188.07s -> 6196.54s]  plugs into your tv it's not gonna i don't think there'll be there's gonna be total packages
[6197.26s -> 6209.30s]  it's gonna happen listen to me guys i remember i i predicted the video game olympics and people
[6209.30s -> 6224.62s]  said i was wrong i'll be wrong again in 2019 i'll be correct in 2025 nobody else predicted that it
[6224.62s -> 6235.99s]  was me somebody somebody will write up and look it's it's written in stone 20 years from now
[6237.26s -> 6242.38s]  i'll be my picture will be like on the fucking hundred dollar bill of video gaming history
[6245.05s -> 6249.77s]  they'll be having i'll be one of those like old commentators that they oh and remember we
[6249.85s -> 6258.82s]  interestingly enough back in 2012 one of our most celebrated video game commentators to ever live
[6259.54s -> 6267.50s]  germa985 gave us a little tidbit and then people thought it wasn't real back then and i'll get like
[6267.50s -> 6291.58s]  a whole celebrated piece egomaniac a humble streamer egomaniac imagine really thinking
[6291.58s -> 6296.06s]  and like hoping that somebody like fucking writes a book about something you said in like a tf2
[6296.06s -> 6307.38s]  gameplay commentary there has to be people that are like that right i mean you
[6311.27s -> 6316.23s]  okay all right let's move on clue the start but thanks for the 250 thanks for getting up so early
[6316.23s -> 6326.58s]  to stream today what was your favorite game shown this year um i don't know favorite game
[6328.01s -> 6338.90s]  my absolute favorite one it's yeah i it's really easy to say elden ring but i feel like that's such
[6338.90s -> 6347.14s]  an easy answer that there's got to be another one that i would say instead no more heroes 3
[6347.14s -> 6356.47s]  probably i i really really loved those games i thought there was so much fun no gameplay but
[6356.47s -> 6366.30s]  it's it's a thing and it's real so what did i like about elden ring it's just another from
[6366.30s -> 6371.34s]  software game and george r.r martin is helping to make the world that's enough for me to be like
[6371.34s -> 6384.07s]  that's a i love that but that's that's why i said it's such an easy answer i i don't know if a game
[6384.07s -> 6390.68s]  can essentially even win this year you know what game probably won this year's e3 doom eternal
[6390.68s -> 6399.08s]  because it's one of the only video games that showed more than one minute of gameplay if you're
[6399.08s -> 6414.95s]  just going by that so if you want that that probably is what won the whole e3 but by that
[6414.95s -> 6426.07s]  logic star wars is in the top five because it was one of the only ones to show anything i like to
[6426.15s -> 6433.26s]  keep my expectations very low just because of all the i mean we've seen the videos of hey watchdogs
[6433.26s -> 6441.70s]  let's go through like five filters after release of what the game actually is so i'm looking let's
[6441.70s -> 6448.90s]  put it i'm not excited for but i'm looking forward to no more heroes three elden ring
[6453.32s -> 6459.94s]  and i gotta get a third one come on i gotta get a third one cyberpunk is really easy to say too
[6459.94s -> 6462.90s]  no i gotta get what's the third one that i really really cared about
[6463.86s -> 6467.82s]  breath of the wild no i didn't play the first one i didn't play breath of the wild
[6468.54s -> 6481.54s]  minecraft diablo uh but i is that it might be it really might be oh fall guys that yep that's
[6481.54s -> 6488.15s]  another one that yeah that looks like it's gonna be a ton of fun or that heroes of might magic
[6488.15s -> 6495.67s]  there was a good i forgot about i watched those trailers yesterday i'm not really excited for
[6495.67s -> 6501.83s]  meat fortress i think it's cool and i'll definitely do it but that's not like a video game to be
[6501.83s -> 6513.62s]  excited about that's like a cool tech display that's going to be in another game there they go
[6513.62s -> 6522.52s]  those are probably the three or four pretty cool uh let's get the credits on screen this is probably
[6522.52s -> 6529.69s]  going to be uh it's probably going to be fairly quick here actually that's going to be really
[6529.69s -> 6535.10s]  it's going to be really slow isn't it yeah let's get watch this this is going to be this is going
[6535.10s -> 6546.65s]  to be weird watch ready the faster it is the more people have subscribed thanks for supporting the
[6546.65s -> 6563.40s]  stream less than a couple hours but still thank you guys all of you vr friday no we're doing unlock
[6563.40s -> 6569.93s]  friday read them read i can't i can't read them i'll tell you know why i can't read them
[6570.65s -> 6575.21s]  because i didn't i don't read anybody else's and like this is if i read these then that's
[6576.87s -> 6584.52s]  that's not fair if i read these then like it's not fair for people that i don't read
[6585.40s -> 6622.95s]  read one okay i'll pick out one who's it gonna be who am i gonna read grill thank you so much

[6681.75s -> 6687.03s]  i remembered there's been a lot so lucas thank you lucas for the five dollars
[6687.91s -> 6695.83s]  what do you think of the valve index did you get one no i have a vibe uh i bought a vibe
[6696.71s -> 6705.42s]  like two months before all these cool new devices were announced so i have the original vibe i'm
[6705.42s -> 6714.86s]  not going to be getting the index but the vibe works just fine so i probably won't be getting
[6714.86s -> 6719.48s]  the index either at all or immediately i maybe i'll upgrade some of the pieces i want the
[6719.48s -> 6727.96s]  controllers so i'll definitely get the controllers because i like the vibe controllers
[6727.96s -> 6732.36s]  aren't uncomfortable but sometimes i really do feel like i'm an air traffic controller with
[6732.36s -> 6747.35s]  these big cones in my hands so i will definitely get the new knuckle controllers at least but
[6747.35s -> 6752.98s]  thank you uh lucas for the five dollars and finally nile oregon thanks for the three dollars
