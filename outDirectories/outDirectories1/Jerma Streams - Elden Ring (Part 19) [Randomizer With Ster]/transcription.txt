[0.00s -> 7.44s]  You see what I got a rush and get a get up there now.
[8.04s -> 12.42s]  Yeah, wait, so it is your so that's your fault.
[12.92s -> 14.42s]  But but hold on though.
[14.42s -> 16.62s]  But I didn't I said you good to go.
[16.62s -> 18.82s]  I'm going to take a shower and get set up and you said yeah,
[18.82s -> 19.52s]  you were awake.
[22.96s -> 29.22s]  Yeah, so you were you were you in like a full-on panic when you
[29.22s -> 35.08s]  said yeah, I was a little confused at first and then I realized
[35.48s -> 37.58s]  I like checked my phone and you hadn't sent me a discord
[37.58s -> 38.08s]  message.
[38.48s -> 40.08s]  So I kind of just laid in bed for a while.
[42.58s -> 43.38s]  Anyways, how you doing?
[43.68s -> 44.98s]  You sound a lot louder today.
[46.08s -> 50.88s]  I did adjust my mic a little bit this week because I heard that
[50.88s -> 53.38s]  I was low on yours and I always I don't know.
[53.38s -> 54.98s]  I feel like I'm low a lot of the time.
[55.68s -> 57.58s]  You definitely I just I turned it down.
[58.18s -> 59.08s]  You're in a good spot.
[59.68s -> 60.08s]  Good.
[60.68s -> 61.98s]  But yeah, hope you're doing good.
[61.98s -> 67.68s]  You I heard and I did see that you were playing Neo 2.
[68.58s -> 71.48s]  Is there any assessment you can give us I can give you an
[71.48s -> 74.08s]  assessment because since I talked to you about Neo last
[74.08s -> 78.86s]  week, I have 40 hours played and I can tell you that this
[78.86s -> 79.16s]  morning.
[79.16s -> 81.36s]  I was really excited to play Elden Ring with you and a little
[81.36s -> 83.66s]  bit disappointed when I realized it wasn't Neo.
[84.56s -> 85.26s]  Wow.
[86.06s -> 86.86s]  Wait a minute.
[87.16s -> 88.06s]  Hold on a second.
[89.10s -> 94.06s]  So you're this why me just mechanically speaking the combat
[94.26s -> 96.96s]  because Elden Ring as you said kind of is just attack with
[96.96s -> 97.46s]  weapon.
[97.66s -> 99.86s]  There's like no nuance to a lot of the stuff that you do.
[99.96s -> 101.86s]  Yeah, there's a lot.
[101.86s -> 106.06s]  I don't like about Neo the first 10 hours were like grinding
[106.06s -> 110.16s]  your face on a cheese grater to try and understand all of
[110.16s -> 112.66s]  the different words where you need to charge up.
[112.76s -> 114.46s]  You need to gather enough anima.
[114.76s -> 116.76s]  No, I still don't even know you need to gather enough
[118.06s -> 121.56s]  Amarita to charge up your anima to get your Yo-Kai shift
[121.56s -> 122.06s]  ready.
[122.76s -> 126.16s]  It's like nothing was designed for a human to understand.
[126.86s -> 129.96s]  But you've kind of grown accustomed to that and you actually
[129.96s -> 130.66s]  prefer it now.
[132.92s -> 136.22s]  I would say mechanically combat is a lot of fun and I was
[136.22s -> 138.12s]  even thinking in bed last night because I was like, you
[138.12s -> 140.52s]  know, he's going to ask me like how would I rate it like
[140.52s -> 143.12s]  Elden Ring is obviously it's too good.
[143.22s -> 146.02s]  You can't compare but then I was thinking about like the
[146.02s -> 148.92s]  last Dark Souls like Dark Souls 3 and trying to compare to
[148.92s -> 152.79s]  that and I realized is it just me or was Dark Souls 3 not
[152.79s -> 153.89s]  memorable at all?
[155.45s -> 159.25s]  I actually went back to try it again the first time in a
[159.25s -> 164.35s]  while and it actually I found myself saying more often than
[164.45s -> 167.15s]  than not going this like sucks.
[168.78s -> 172.18s]  I don't think it sucks, but I was like, you know how you
[172.18s -> 174.58s]  like think back to Elden Ring you can think of like Millennia
[174.58s -> 177.58s]  and the boss at the end like all the shit like even Dark
[177.58s -> 179.58s]  Souls 2 I have so many memories and I was like, okay,
[179.58s -> 181.38s]  well, what are the zones in Dark Souls 3?
[183.01s -> 188.01s]  Yeah, there's like the crab in the swamp is like I was
[188.01s -> 192.21s]  really blanking for way too long and it is a great game.
[192.71s -> 194.91s]  Maybe that's just like the sign that like it's out of my
[194.91s -> 197.71s]  memory and I could play it again, but I'm going to have
[197.71s -> 200.61s]  to probably do a serious reassessment of where I put
[200.71s -> 204.01s]  from software games because I did play some Dark Souls 3
[204.01s -> 206.91s]  off stream like I don't know last year at some point and
[206.91s -> 209.51s]  I really did it seemed like every single area.
[210.51s -> 213.01s]  I think like Holly was sitting next to me on the couch
[213.61s -> 216.51s]  and I'm just like fucking stupid like this area is fucking
[216.51s -> 219.91s]  dumb. A lot of the game is set up to like piss you off.
[219.91s -> 222.41s]  I feel like I took a little bit of a she's like, do you
[222.41s -> 225.11s]  first she's like, do you like this game like I thought
[225.11s -> 226.91s]  you liked I thought this is like one of your favorites
[226.91s -> 227.81s]  and I'm like, yeah, it is.
[229.75s -> 231.85s]  I think they blur together to like some of the areas.
[231.85s -> 234.65s]  I'm like was that Dark Souls 3 the like the like frozen
[234.65s -> 236.35s]  area with the invisible enemies.
[238.10s -> 240.20s]  I don't remember playing through Dark Souls 1.
[240.20s -> 243.20s]  I think I did it sort of in the same period.
[245.00s -> 245.90s]  Dark Souls 1.
[246.90s -> 251.10s]  I hate with a passion two or three spots in Dark Souls
[251.10s -> 254.40s]  1, but I think as a whole I think it is.
[255.20s -> 257.20s]  It's probably just better than Dark Souls 3 and I had
[257.20s -> 257.60s]  it wrong.
[257.60s -> 258.30s]  I had it flipped.
[263.78s -> 264.18s]  Who knows?
[264.18s -> 266.98s]  Anyway, dude, I could go back like a year or two from
[266.98s -> 269.88s]  now do it play through it again and have the completely
[269.88s -> 270.58s]  opposite opinion.
[271.79s -> 272.89s]  That's just how these games work.
[272.99s -> 277.53s]  I feel like around that time was over saturated with
[277.53s -> 280.13s]  like souls like and I played so many and by the time
[280.13s -> 282.03s]  Dark Souls 3 was there was like this was good.
[282.03s -> 287.21s]  But played so many I feel like I know what about
[287.21s -> 287.71s]  secure.
[287.71s -> 288.71s]  I feel like I'm secure.
[288.71s -> 292.71s]  I just completely just wiped it from my memory and
[292.71s -> 293.71s]  like it was good.
[294.85s -> 297.25s]  But like I it was it was though.
[297.25s -> 298.95s]  I remember it was like really really good.
[300.05s -> 300.95s]  It was pretty good.
[302.05s -> 303.05s]  This game is very loud.
[303.85s -> 308.15s]  Actually, I at the time I was a I was a secure non
[308.15s -> 311.17s]  enjoyer, but I think I've come around.
[313.57s -> 316.47s]  Yeah, you were a secure row non-enjoyer for a while.
[318.10s -> 318.90s]  I can't remember.
[318.90s -> 322.70s]  There's like one simple mechanics that pushed me
[322.70s -> 325.20s]  over the edge of like needing to farm for healing
[325.20s -> 328.10s]  or like just in general like you could only use your
[328.10s -> 330.50s]  your arm moves a certain amount of times and you
[330.50s -> 332.60s]  have to like collect arm oil or some shit.
[332.90s -> 335.50s]  Yeah, why would you gate the like fun mechanic around
[335.50s -> 337.90s]  like I need to farm enough resource to use this?
[339.80s -> 342.80s]  Yeah, it's just all these games.
[342.80s -> 346.37s]  You just like flip on them every like six months.
[346.37s -> 348.07s]  I have a different opinion of each one of these
[348.07s -> 348.47s]  games.
[348.47s -> 349.47s]  It's weird how that works.
[349.47s -> 350.17s]  I swear.
[350.17s -> 350.87s]  I promise you.
[351.48s -> 355.38s]  Well, the assessment is Neo 2 I'd say was better in
[355.38s -> 356.28s]  Dark Souls 3.
[356.38s -> 357.48s]  I have a lot of fun.
[357.48s -> 360.18s]  The level design is actually crazy good.
[360.88s -> 363.28s]  It has like I wish the areas were a little bit more
[363.38s -> 365.68s]  interesting like Dark Souls environments really can't
[365.68s -> 366.28s]  be beat.
[366.38s -> 369.58s]  Yeah, but like once you finally get over the hump of
[369.58s -> 373.08s]  these mechanics like do not make any sense and they're
[373.08s -> 374.38s]  basically non-english.
[375.48s -> 376.68s]  There's a lot of fun to the game.
[378.54s -> 380.84s]  I I'm willing to try it.
[381.64s -> 384.04s]  I probably don't think I'd want to scream that game.
[384.04s -> 388.24s]  I don't think you would I think not streaming.
[388.24s -> 389.34s]  It is a great call.
[389.44s -> 393.84s]  Okay, I have never been backseated with like such
[393.84s -> 398.84s]  like crazy such as just Determinated backseating.
[398.84s -> 401.14s]  Yes, you're not going to understand what's happening
[401.24s -> 402.94s]  and you're going to get frustrated because the game
[402.94s -> 405.34s]  has a lot of frustrating shit and you're going to
[405.34s -> 407.24s]  get like mad and you're going to look to chat for
[407.24s -> 410.14s]  like some sort of like we're in this together like
[410.14s -> 412.04s]  that fucking sucked and chats going to be like you
[412.04s -> 415.20s]  need to keep pulse more often like dude, you're so
[415.20s -> 416.00s]  bad like it's me.
[416.00s -> 417.10s]  It makes me angry.
[418.78s -> 422.18s]  Hey, so so can I get some support in here and you
[422.18s -> 424.48s]  just look over and it's just like like the people
[424.48s -> 426.68s]  have like the stream muted like the mute thing.
[427.62s -> 428.72s]  Just like oh, okay.
[429.22s -> 430.22s]  You're not listening.
[430.92s -> 434.42s]  It has like new content for like new game plus one
[434.42s -> 436.92s]  two three four like it has a lot of content.
[437.42s -> 439.62s]  So I think there's some people that have spent like
[439.62s -> 443.70s]  thousands of hours in the game and then they really
[443.70s -> 446.60s]  need you to just be better.
[446.70s -> 449.00s]  Okay, so let me ask you a very very important
[449.00s -> 449.40s]  question.
[450.70s -> 454.50s]  Yes, if I got over the if I got over it the first
[454.50s -> 457.90s]  10 hours would I like it if I kind of understood it
[457.90s -> 460.85s]  like you do know that what you know about I think
[460.85s -> 464.33s]  the parts that are thrown in your face of like the
[464.33s -> 466.23s]  stance switching and the key pulsing you kind of
[466.23s -> 468.63s]  naturally you kind of get after a while after the
[468.63s -> 470.83s]  first day like it kind of just I don't really even
[470.83s -> 471.73s]  think about it anymore.
[472.13s -> 475.72s]  Okay, but it's also really not as important as
[475.72s -> 478.38s]  people would make you think okay, because there's
[478.38s -> 479.88s]  tons of times on my stream where it's like I would
[479.88s -> 481.78s]  attack something like dude, he's never people.
[481.78s -> 483.48s]  When is he going to do the key pulse to get his
[483.48s -> 486.20s]  stamina back, but it's like they're going to die
[486.20s -> 488.29s]  anyway, that doesn't matter.
[488.29s -> 489.19s]  Like yeah, it's just like whatever.
[489.19s -> 490.99s]  Yeah, it's like I feel like the same thing would
[490.99s -> 491.39s]  happen.
[491.49s -> 493.79s]  I don't know random comparison slay the spire.
[493.99s -> 496.39s]  We're like, you know, you have lethal next turn.
[497.44s -> 499.04s]  So you just sort of end turn even though you could
[499.04s -> 500.64s]  have ended at this turn, but they can't because
[500.64s -> 502.14s]  you have armor hold on though.
[503.14s -> 505.94s]  I played slay the spire until it got too complicated
[505.94s -> 507.04s]  where I was like, I don't care anymore.
[508.65s -> 511.35s]  What once it got to be like I had to do five
[511.35s -> 512.65s]  different math problems in a row.
[513.29s -> 514.89s]  I was like, I think I'll just do something else.
[515.81s -> 517.89s]  I think I'll play something else think we'll play
[517.89s -> 518.59s]  some vampire.
[518.69s -> 523.11s]  I think I unlocked I love how that's an insult now.
[524.70s -> 526.90s]  I mean just you know, I don't really want to like
[526.90s -> 530.88s]  do anything after I unlocked the poison.
[531.18s -> 532.58s]  There was a poison character and that was really
[532.58s -> 532.88s]  fun.
[533.32s -> 535.76s]  But then the game got like really hard and I was
[535.76s -> 536.46s]  like, yeah, that was fun.
[536.46s -> 539.66s]  I like completed a few runs and I'm kind of done.
[539.76s -> 541.56s]  Well, that's what I mean, you know, like you can
[541.56s -> 544.16s]  poison the enemy and you have a they're going to
[544.16s -> 545.56s]  die to poison is your thing on the ground.
[547.25s -> 548.45s]  I don't even have a game open.
[551.30s -> 551.70s]  Mr.
[551.70s -> 553.70s]  Rush rushing to get ready.
[554.33s -> 556.13s]  He's not in the game.
[556.13s -> 557.33s]  I'm not rushing.
[559.08s -> 560.08s]  I thought you said you rushing.
[560.08s -> 561.88s]  I thought you said you like jumped up and like
[561.88s -> 563.38s]  panicked and were like, I got to get on there.
[563.38s -> 564.48s]  I got to get my stream ready.
[564.78s -> 566.08s]  That panic is over.
[566.18s -> 566.98s]  Oh, okay.
[566.98s -> 568.38s]  So now you just chose a while ago.
[568.38s -> 571.84s]  Yeah, then I realized that was an hour early like
[571.84s -> 573.04s]  an hour and a half early.
[573.24s -> 575.24s]  They you if you were really early at that point.
[577.28s -> 578.58s]  Yeah, I'm ready to go.
[578.58s -> 580.18s]  Whenever you get your sign on the game with the
[580.18s -> 582.58s]  mod that I did thing.
[583.94s -> 584.94s]  I was very prepared.
[586.10s -> 588.40s]  Hey, dude, it's not even two o'clock.
[588.50s -> 590.10s]  It's 154 right now.
[590.60s -> 595.95s]  Oh on time with some with some pregame and I said
[595.95s -> 599.35s]  this to you the buttons for dodge roll is like
[599.35s -> 602.45s]  switched in Neo and it's like hard switch like you
[602.45s -> 602.95s]  can't.
[603.25s -> 603.75s]  Oh, that's right.
[603.75s -> 605.85s]  You said hey, dude, like please like make sure
[605.85s -> 607.45s]  you play well today because I'm not going to even
[607.45s -> 608.65s]  know the buttons of Elden Ring.
[608.65s -> 609.35s]  That's what you said.
[610.08s -> 612.68s]  I'm a little concerned that I'm going to be trying
[612.68s -> 615.76s]  to keep all some stuff.
[615.86s -> 619.79s]  So I maybe I do just like get some magic and watch
[619.79s -> 621.69s]  you for a little bit.
[622.62s -> 623.72s]  Well, I think we're all right.
[624.32s -> 625.62s]  Our characters are pretty beefed up now.
[628.45s -> 629.45s]  Let's give a quick recap.
[630.21s -> 632.51s]  So I can do that because you've played a different
[632.51s -> 634.91s]  video game for like 50 straight hours since we
[634.91s -> 635.51s]  last talked.
[636.56s -> 638.46s]  So we were at the Volcano Manor.
[639.00s -> 643.07s]  We were rousing around doing a little bit of you
[643.07s -> 644.37s]  know, an investigation to see where we're going
[644.37s -> 646.97s]  to go next and I think we ended up saying that we
[646.97s -> 650.04s]  were going to do a right card, right?
[650.04s -> 650.94s]  That's the next plan.
[651.24s -> 651.94s]  That was the goal.
[651.94s -> 654.24s]  So to get we never found Volcano Manor.
[654.24s -> 656.64s]  We don't really we were kind of on our way there.
[656.74s -> 656.94s]  Yeah.
[656.94s -> 661.51s]  So we're in the vicinity and I think the last thing
[661.51s -> 665.47s]  that happened is you laughed audibly laughed at
[665.47s -> 665.97s]  the character.
[665.97s -> 667.87s]  That was the the mage character that you thought
[667.87s -> 669.07s]  was a randomized character, but it's where you
[669.07s -> 670.27s]  get the Comet Azur.
[671.39s -> 675.20s]  I think that's the last thing we did and I forget
[675.20s -> 675.70s]  what that is.
[676.30s -> 679.06s]  Is it see the water terminus?
[679.36s -> 682.26s]  I think I have no idea the words you're saying
[682.46s -> 684.26s]  Subterranean Inquisition Chamber.
[684.74s -> 686.23s]  Yokai shift.
[686.53s -> 687.53s]  I opened my way.
[687.53s -> 690.03s]  I where are we teleporting and then you can join
[690.03s -> 690.33s]  me.
[690.83s -> 694.33s]  We are seriously what button interacts with the
[694.33s -> 695.13s]  bonfire.
[695.67s -> 702.73s]  What why what it's why is going to be oh, no, he
[702.73s -> 704.53s]  doesn't even know the buttons of the game.
[705.42s -> 705.82s]  Okay.
[707.90s -> 708.60s]  Here's the thing though.
[708.60s -> 711.30s]  I get exactly what you were you coming from though.
[711.40s -> 713.40s]  It's it's just on the controller for like an
[713.40s -> 716.80s]  Xbox controller B and A are reversed and for the
[716.80s -> 718.70s]  first like two or three hours and you know, it's
[718.70s -> 720.40s]  like I hate this.
[720.60s -> 724.20s]  So I have you played a high five rush by the way.
[725.55s -> 726.35s]  No, okay.
[726.35s -> 727.35s]  A lot of people wanted me to play it.
[727.35s -> 728.55s]  They like stream it stream it with they don't
[728.55s -> 731.85s]  know is like I got game pass and I'm already in
[731.85s -> 732.15s]  it.
[733.09s -> 736.17s]  It games fucking incredible by the way, but right
[736.17s -> 739.27s]  bumper is dodge in that game and because I've been
[739.27s -> 740.97s]  playing that right bumper.
[741.07s -> 744.79s]  I kept trying to hit B and it just kind of doesn't
[744.79s -> 745.09s]  work.
[745.09s -> 746.99s]  So I might be in the same boat for a little while.
[747.88s -> 748.08s]  Okay.
[748.08s -> 749.68s]  We'll see how our dodging goes.
[749.68s -> 753.44s]  Yeah, my brain got reprogrammed game pass seriously
[753.84s -> 756.92s]  Xbox ever I'm ever like a few years ago during one
[756.92s -> 758.72s]  of those conferences when they were just talking
[758.72s -> 760.22s]  about this thing they wanted to do.
[760.62s -> 761.42s]  Let me just go over it.
[761.42s -> 763.12s]  I know people can say oh he loves game pass.
[763.12s -> 766.94s]  He's a game pass Andy Monster Hunter rise high
[766.94s -> 770.05s]  five rush and Goldeneye have all come out in the
[770.05s -> 772.15s]  last like two weeks on game pass.
[773.33s -> 774.63s]  That's fucking ridiculous.
[775.03s -> 776.53s]  That's that's actually ridiculous.
[776.53s -> 778.73s]  Like what that service is unbelievable.
[780.83s -> 783.73s]  What is there a Goldeneye like remaster or something?
[783.83s -> 786.93s]  Yeah, they did like a Goldeneye HD kind of remaster.
[787.23s -> 789.33s]  Oh, I thought I know there was like a fan version
[789.33s -> 789.83s]  at some point.
[789.83s -> 790.73s]  I never heard of this one.
[792.55s -> 794.95s]  I'm just I'm just saying I'm just saying it exactly
[794.95s -> 799.02s]  the way that I see it Xbox everyone Phil Spencer
[799.02s -> 799.82s]  was on that stage.
[799.82s -> 801.42s]  Everyone was like oh game pass.
[801.42s -> 804.45s]  It's gonna I resent anything I ever said negatively
[804.45s -> 807.15s]  about I respect anything he says because he is the
[807.15s -> 809.45s]  most rectangular man I have ever seen.
[810.56s -> 813.16s]  Is that I don't even know what that means.
[813.46s -> 816.94s]  He is fucking squared off.
[817.50s -> 821.25s]  You know what I'm saying like because of Phil Spencer
[821.55s -> 825.48s]  I started calling myself the cubic man because I
[825.48s -> 828.08s]  aspire to be as square as him.
[829.03s -> 831.43s]  I want like you know what they go for the measurement
[831.43s -> 835.03s]  of like one cubic meter of like I am one cubic
[835.03s -> 836.13s]  meter of man.
[837.56s -> 841.22s]  I am the exact measurement or well Phil Spencer is
[841.22s -> 845.19s]  but I want to be like him.
[845.39s -> 851.64s]  All right, but yeah, I mean I would say yeah my you
[852.44s -> 854.44s]  why are you talking about him like he's a Minecraft
[854.44s -> 855.04s]  character.
[855.54s -> 863.63s]  He is what wait my cameras stage presence dude.
[863.63s -> 865.93s]  He walks on stage and there's cracks in the floor.
[866.53s -> 867.33s]  What's wrong with my camera?
[867.33s -> 868.73s]  There's a gap left to close.
[869.23s -> 870.33s]  Oh, sorry about that.
[870.43s -> 876.95s]  How did you even see that what but anyways game
[876.95s -> 880.65s]  pass they got this cloud gaming thing and it's so
[880.65s -> 882.75s]  I'm telling you I would not be saying this if I
[882.75s -> 885.79s]  didn't fucking believe it game past is legit.
[885.79s -> 886.59s]  It's the real deal.
[886.69s -> 888.99s]  It's the real deal believe in believe it.
[889.49s -> 891.09s]  Can you not afford games?
[892.13s -> 896.71s]  No, it's just look I have this problem with video
[896.71s -> 897.21s]  games.
[897.51s -> 898.51s]  There are a lot of them.
[898.81s -> 901.11s]  Okay, there are a lot of video games a lot of
[901.11s -> 904.21s]  stuff releases indie games triple-a games.
[904.21s -> 905.51s]  It's like I don't fucking even know what the
[905.51s -> 906.71s]  hell is even I don't even know what I want to
[906.71s -> 907.11s]  do.
[907.41s -> 910.21s]  So what happens is game pass just dumps once every
[910.21s -> 910.71s]  couple weeks.
[910.71s -> 911.61s]  Sometimes it's one week.
[911.61s -> 913.81s]  Sometimes it's three weeks, but at least once a
[913.81s -> 915.01s]  month at least once or twice a month.
[915.41s -> 917.61s]  You like you get multiverses on that.
[919.81s -> 924.71s]  Holy versus is is free multiverses is already for
[924.71s -> 925.21s]  free.
[925.41s -> 926.31s]  I didn't know that.
[926.31s -> 926.71s]  All right.
[926.71s -> 931.55s]  Well, yes, you can but anyways having the option
[931.55s -> 935.65s]  just to have like hey, there's four or five games
[935.65s -> 936.65s]  that are here right now.
[937.45s -> 938.45s]  Open them right now.
[938.45s -> 940.65s]  One just play one right now and just with the
[940.65s -> 942.05s]  cloud shit just open it.
[942.05s -> 942.95s]  You don't have to install it.
[942.95s -> 944.65s]  You don't have to like, oh, let me go read reviews.
[944.95s -> 945.35s]  No, no, no.
[945.35s -> 948.25s]  Oh like for instance, like, oh, I don't like it's
[948.25s -> 949.45s]  like a shadow play.
[949.45s -> 950.75s]  You don't even have to download it.
[951.25s -> 953.75s]  You you can that's the best part.
[953.85s -> 955.35s]  If you open one of these up and you're like, you
[955.35s -> 956.35s]  know, that was actually really fun.
[956.35s -> 958.95s]  I like that just hit the install button to set your
[958.95s -> 960.75s]  save file continues.
[962.05s -> 963.45s]  You don't have to worry about like, oh, I got to
[963.45s -> 963.85s]  start over.
[963.85s -> 964.35s]  No, you don't.
[965.32s -> 968.32s]  I'm telling you I will I will be an Xbox game pass
[969.22s -> 969.82s]  fan here.
[971.85s -> 972.55s]  You can be a fan.
[972.55s -> 973.55s]  It's cool to like things.
[973.55s -> 976.55s]  Yeah, but I will say it's definitely one of those
[976.55s -> 976.75s]  things.
[976.75s -> 979.55s]  It feels like a Netflix like I can just get on there
[979.55s -> 981.05s]  and be like, what's on game pass today?
[981.05s -> 983.65s]  By the way, there's like a hundred plus other games
[983.65s -> 984.95s]  that just are on there permanently.
[986.78s -> 987.38s]  Plenty good ones.
[987.38s -> 988.78s]  You should be getting paid for this.
[990.18s -> 990.78s]  No, I don't.
[990.78s -> 993.08s]  I shouldn't because I just I just like it.
[995.15s -> 997.85s]  What we said any good ones lately any like you you
[997.85s -> 998.85s]  tried something on game pass.
[998.85s -> 1000.75s]  You wouldn't have tried but you actually liked it
[1000.75s -> 1001.05s]  a lot.
[1001.65s -> 1002.15s]  Yes.
[1003.85s -> 1006.55s]  And it's not like a mobile game called like tar
[1006.55s -> 1007.35s]  pit or whatever.
[1007.55s -> 1008.45s]  Gunfire reborn.
[1009.82s -> 1010.42s]  It's pretty good.
[1010.42s -> 1012.62s]  Gunfire reborn was just on game pass just opened
[1012.62s -> 1012.82s]  it.
[1012.82s -> 1013.72s]  I was like this is kind of fun.
[1013.92s -> 1015.72s]  I played it for like at least for probably four
[1015.72s -> 1023.67s]  or five days gang and also Monster Hunter rises
[1023.67s -> 1024.17s]  on there.
[1024.67s -> 1026.67s]  I was actually kind of thinking about starting
[1026.67s -> 1027.67s]  that engine back up.
[1027.67s -> 1028.47s]  Oh Monster Hunter.
[1028.47s -> 1029.47s]  Wait, really?
[1030.27s -> 1030.97s]  I'm gonna open it.
[1031.87s -> 1032.27s]  Okay.
[1036.15s -> 1036.55s]  Fuck it.
[1036.55s -> 1037.65s]  What who cares?
[1037.75s -> 1038.45s]  There's no pressure.
[1038.45s -> 1038.95s]  Just open it.
[1039.85s -> 1040.95s]  Who's going to stop you?
[1042.05s -> 1043.05s]  Usually pressure.
[1043.05s -> 1047.55s]  Who's like, excuse me, sir.
[1047.65s -> 1049.65s]  You cannot play Monster Hunter rise today.
[1049.65s -> 1054.78s]  But Monster Hunter really he's not going to stream
[1054.78s -> 1055.08s]  it.
[1055.28s -> 1055.88s]  Oh, maybe I will.
[1055.88s -> 1056.38s]  I don't know.
[1057.28s -> 1057.58s]  All right.
[1057.58s -> 1059.48s]  Are you like have you opened the game at this
[1059.48s -> 1059.78s]  point?
[1059.78s -> 1060.28s]  Yes.
[1060.28s -> 1061.78s]  I said that I put the thing down.
[1061.78s -> 1062.48s]  You can join me.
[1062.48s -> 1064.68s]  I've just been fucking walking around the bonfire.
[1064.68s -> 1064.98s]  All right.
[1064.98s -> 1065.08s]  All right.
[1065.08s -> 1066.08s]  Let's go race the grace.
[1066.08s -> 1066.68s]  Excuse me.
[1066.78s -> 1070.28s]  Honestly and high fire high fire rush to I that
[1070.28s -> 1071.88s]  was just a surprise launch.
[1072.78s -> 1074.38s]  They were just like, oh yeah, by the way, this
[1074.38s -> 1074.98s]  game exists.
[1074.98s -> 1077.58s]  Okay, and it's here now stir-take for now.
[1077.58s -> 1078.08s]  No.
[1078.58s -> 1079.08s]  Yes.
[1079.48s -> 1081.78s]  I was reading all the reviews of high fire rush
[1081.88s -> 1083.58s]  and all of them like, can you believe this like
[1083.58s -> 1085.58s]  silent drop it's crazy.
[1085.58s -> 1089.28s]  This is silent silent drop Bethesda's like official
[1089.28s -> 1090.08s]  game conference.
[1090.08s -> 1091.68s]  They're like biggest thing that they do to like
[1091.68s -> 1092.68s]  announce all our new games.
[1092.68s -> 1094.98s]  They announced it at their biggest conference.
[1095.68s -> 1096.68s]  How is that silent?
[1097.18s -> 1098.78s]  Did you watch the Bethesda conference?
[1099.18s -> 1105.65s]  I did well silent in the way that there was no
[1105.65s -> 1107.55s]  release date and she's like, oh hey, here's like
[1107.75s -> 1110.15s]  the gameplay launch trailer and you can play it
[1110.15s -> 1110.75s]  right now.
[1110.85s -> 1112.25s]  I think that's immediate.
[1114.19s -> 1115.89s]  That's why the English language is very different
[1115.89s -> 1116.59s]  very specific.
[1116.79s -> 1117.99s]  Yeah, but that's cool though.
[1118.69s -> 1119.19s]  Okay.
[1119.39s -> 1121.69s]  Look maybe not like, oh wow, what a silent stealth
[1121.69s -> 1122.19s]  launch.
[1122.49s -> 1124.39s]  Do you think it's cool to have a gameplay trailer
[1124.39s -> 1125.79s]  like a launch trailer and they like, oh by the
[1125.79s -> 1126.69s]  way, you can download it now.
[1126.79s -> 1127.09s]  Okay.
[1127.09s -> 1128.99s]  So like if you didn't announce that you were
[1128.99s -> 1130.79s]  going to do a scream stream and one day you just
[1130.79s -> 1131.99s]  show up and you start screaming.
[1131.99s -> 1134.09s]  Is that a silent drop of a screaming stream?
[1136.34s -> 1136.94s]  Well, that depends.
[1136.94s -> 1139.94s]  Did it take me like three to four years to prepare
[1139.94s -> 1140.74s]  the scream stream?
[1142.15s -> 1144.45s]  Like how big is that?
[1144.65s -> 1145.45s]  Of course not.
[1145.85s -> 1147.45s]  So I don't think it makes no, I don't think that
[1147.45s -> 1147.75s]  works.
[1147.85s -> 1148.85s]  I hold up.
[1148.85s -> 1149.75s]  How do you run?
[1151.37s -> 1152.67s]  Fucking what?
[1156.54s -> 1157.14s]  All right, dude.
[1157.54s -> 1158.94s]  I mean, I know how to do that.
[1159.34s -> 1160.04s]  No, seriously.
[1160.04s -> 1160.74s]  How do you run?
[1160.74s -> 1161.54s]  I'm not joking.
[1161.84s -> 1164.14s]  It's B you hold B.
[1164.84s -> 1167.44s]  Okay, he's not pretending.
[1169.22s -> 1170.22s]  How do you get on the horse?
[1171.09s -> 1173.89s]  Oh, that's a little more complicated hold Y and
[1173.89s -> 1175.99s]  then you probably have a map to one up down left
[1175.99s -> 1176.99s]  or right on your d-pad.
[1178.13s -> 1178.53s]  Okay.
[1179.92s -> 1182.42s]  This is going to be a I can't believe I deleted my
[1182.42s -> 1184.82s]  entire memory of like how to play this dude.
[1184.82s -> 1185.62s]  It is gone.
[1185.62s -> 1186.22s]  Your memory.
[1186.22s -> 1187.22s]  It's gone.
[1187.52s -> 1189.32s]  I know we were going up left and there was the
[1189.32s -> 1191.12s]  lava Lake there and we were I think there's a
[1191.32s -> 1197.16s]  yeah, we we actually need to we need to go back.
[1197.16s -> 1198.86s]  I think we need to like actually wrap around here
[1200.28s -> 1201.68s]  like we're on the right side, right?
[1203.58s -> 1204.28s]  Thought it was left.
[1204.28s -> 1206.18s]  I don't think we got up left where we left off.
[1206.18s -> 1207.18s]  Can we get up here this way?
[1213.33s -> 1215.33s]  Just quietly looking at our chat.
[1216.63s -> 1217.83s]  Hey, do we get up that way?
[1217.83s -> 1218.43s]  I want to go.
[1220.23s -> 1222.13s]  So wait this one this one down here.
[1222.53s -> 1224.03s]  Do you see that dude holding a shield in front of
[1224.03s -> 1224.43s]  us?
[1224.43s -> 1225.23s]  Do you see the shield?
[1229.08s -> 1230.28s]  The big like look at the shield.
[1231.22s -> 1235.93s]  It's not finding Nemo where the straight straight
[1235.93s -> 1237.13s]  one walking straight towards him.
[1237.13s -> 1237.83s]  There's a bug.
[1239.29s -> 1239.89s]  Oh, that's a bug.
[1239.89s -> 1241.69s]  I thought that was a guy's holding a shield.
[1241.79s -> 1247.34s]  Okay, I'm want to like start this back up tomorrow.
[1247.84s -> 1248.44s]  Are you good?
[1248.74s -> 1250.54s]  You want to start this up tomorrow?
[1250.54s -> 1251.84s]  Looks like Nemo.
[1252.74s -> 1253.94s]  Oh my god, dude.
[1254.04s -> 1255.04s]  Did you get any sleep?
[1255.04s -> 1255.74s]  Tell me the truth.
[1256.04s -> 1258.74s]  I didn't know you he didn't get any sleep.
[1258.74s -> 1259.64s]  There's a all right.
[1259.64s -> 1260.34s]  How about this?
[1260.64s -> 1261.44s]  This is what we're going to do.
[1261.94s -> 1263.04s]  We're just going to chill out.
[1263.74s -> 1264.04s]  All right.
[1264.04s -> 1265.64s]  We're going to just chill out for a little while.
[1265.64s -> 1266.84s]  We're going to like just relax.
[1267.68s -> 1270.28s]  We'll play for like we'll play for like a few hours
[1270.28s -> 1271.38s]  and no, no, no, I'm good.
[1271.38s -> 1272.28s]  It'll just take a second.
[1272.28s -> 1273.08s]  Trust and follow me.
[1273.28s -> 1274.88s]  Oh, no, I don't know about this.
[1275.08s -> 1276.18s]  I don't know about this.
[1276.28s -> 1277.18s]  I know where I'm going.
[1277.18s -> 1277.98s]  I have memory.
[1277.98s -> 1281.18s]  I just don't like my muscle memory of buttons is off.
[1281.78s -> 1284.08s]  We need to go to Primeval Sorcerer Azure.
[1286.44s -> 1288.04s]  I don't want you to I would okay.
[1288.04s -> 1289.54s]  I would not be following you right now.
[1289.94s -> 1290.54s]  No way.
[1290.94s -> 1292.64s]  I'm not going to follow the sleep deprived guy.
[1292.64s -> 1293.64s]  That's like, yeah, let's walk.
[1293.64s -> 1295.94s]  Let's walk through the fire on the ground.
[1296.24s -> 1297.54s]  Yeah, we killed the thing.
[1297.54s -> 1298.24s]  We killed a boss.
[1298.24s -> 1299.14s]  You're the Mariner.
[1299.54s -> 1301.34s]  No, we got to go to the sorcerer person's body.
[1301.64s -> 1302.84s]  No, no, no on the other side.
[1302.84s -> 1303.44s]  Come with me.
[1303.44s -> 1305.14s]  Oh, no, no, you're following me.
[1305.44s -> 1306.04s]  I'm leading.
[1306.04s -> 1306.84s]  I'm the commander.
[1306.94s -> 1308.74s]  You don't have authority here.
[1309.04s -> 1309.34s]  Okay.
[1309.34s -> 1310.04s]  You were the sub.
[1310.64s -> 1311.04s]  Okay.
[1311.74s -> 1312.04s]  Okay.
[1312.24s -> 1313.34s]  So here's what's gonna happen here.
[1313.34s -> 1314.54s]  This path we were going to go.
[1315.04s -> 1316.54s]  Do you drink coffee, bro?
[1316.54s -> 1317.54s]  Like do you drink coffee?
[1317.64s -> 1318.14s]  No, you don't.
[1318.14s -> 1318.44s]  I don't.
[1318.84s -> 1320.04s]  It doesn't even drink coffee.
[1320.04s -> 1321.24s]  I like what do you drink tea?
[1324.00s -> 1326.40s]  Time we get you like a nice green tea brew.
[1327.86s -> 1330.56s]  I take caffeine pills.
[1331.36s -> 1332.36s]  No, you don't.
[1333.16s -> 1333.76s]  What?
[1335.56s -> 1337.66s]  No, you don't take caffeine pills.
[1337.96s -> 1338.96s]  You don't take those.
[1339.26s -> 1341.16s]  Jerma like an old man.
[1341.26s -> 1347.46s]  I literally have in front of me a Monday to Sunday pill holder
[1347.86s -> 1350.16s]  and there are caffeine pills one for each day.
[1350.16s -> 1351.46s]  All right, but hold on a minute.
[1351.46s -> 1353.66s]  We need to do we need to do a little maybe we shouldn't do
[1353.66s -> 1355.06s]  this assessment on broadcast.
[1355.96s -> 1356.56s]  That's fine.
[1356.66s -> 1357.06s]  Okay.
[1357.86s -> 1359.86s]  How many milligrams of caffeine are in each one of those?
[1360.90s -> 1361.50s]  200.
[1363.06s -> 1363.56s]  Okay.
[1364.76s -> 1368.36s]  But I've heard the it does not feel like 200.
[1368.66s -> 1370.46s]  Like the like digesting it like that.
[1370.46s -> 1372.56s]  It's like if you don't take it on an empty stomach, then you
[1372.56s -> 1374.36s]  don't get like a full powered.
[1374.86s -> 1375.36s]  All right.
[1376.06s -> 1377.76s]  But you don't like you don't you don't you just don't like
[1377.76s -> 1379.66s]  the taste of coffee or like the way or like tea or anything
[1379.66s -> 1382.46s]  like that you have tried to get me to drink coffee before
[1382.46s -> 1385.36s]  like you ordered me your like favorite drink at Duncan.
[1385.56s -> 1387.46s]  Yeah, like one time in Boston.
[1387.66s -> 1388.56s]  You fucking hated it.
[1389.16s -> 1390.56s]  I did I hated it.
[1391.16s -> 1392.66s]  I've tried a lot of different coffee.
[1393.06s -> 1395.56s]  It's all just like it's all just why did you guys burn
[1395.56s -> 1396.26s]  the shit out of this?
[1396.86s -> 1399.16s]  Okay, so we I think we're guys up here.
[1399.16s -> 1400.76s]  We are going the absolute wrong way.
[1401.96s -> 1402.66s]  I'm just right.
[1403.66s -> 1405.96s]  But you got to watch out because they like they have more
[1405.96s -> 1407.26s]  stamina than a yokai around.
[1409.44s -> 1412.24s]  There's you look in a dead sleep and you like ripped
[1412.24s -> 1414.24s]  yourself out of bed to come over here and talk about how
[1414.24s -> 1416.14s]  you like eat caffeine pills every day.
[1417.32s -> 1418.42s]  The block was different too.
[1420.39s -> 1424.19s]  I'm just randomly jumping people watching my stream.
[1425.80s -> 1430.60s]  Like I entered combat attacked jumped back stepped like
[1430.60s -> 1432.30s]  I don't know what's going on.
[1434.10s -> 1434.50s]  All right.
[1434.80s -> 1435.80s]  Hey listen to me.
[1436.40s -> 1438.70s]  I want you to open up your menu and I want you to go to
[1439.30s -> 1441.10s]  Prime Evil Sorcerer Azure.
[1441.98s -> 1443.88s]  That's why we're going this way.
[1445.50s -> 1449.20s]  Okay, but in a minute we're gonna we're gonna go to donkey
[1451.90s -> 1452.60s]  let him cook.
[1453.00s -> 1454.40s]  Are you sure about that?
[1455.80s -> 1456.80s]  I don't know about that.
[1457.60s -> 1458.20s]  Let me cook.
[1463.57s -> 1469.10s]  What the fuck I mean if I die before you do that's gonna
[1469.10s -> 1469.80s]  be embarrassing.
[1470.10s -> 1470.90s]  I could be you.
[1472.47s -> 1473.57s]  What like right now?
[1474.07s -> 1475.67s]  Yeah, what you were gonna give me an assessment.
[1476.17s -> 1479.94s]  Okay, my assessment is so is that the only caffeine you're
[1479.94s -> 1480.54s]  taking in a day?
[1481.34s -> 1481.64s]  Yeah.
[1481.94s -> 1482.34s]  All right.
[1482.34s -> 1482.84s]  That's okay.
[1483.24s -> 1486.98s]  But there are some teas and there are some you can like
[1486.98s -> 1489.68s]  there are like drinks you can drink that aren't just like
[1489.68s -> 1491.18s]  200 milligrams of just caffeine.
[1491.28s -> 1494.48s]  They got like vitamins and like hydration and shit if you
[1494.48s -> 1495.08s]  really want to.
[1495.68s -> 1497.68s]  I have I have matcha tea this morning.
[1497.88s -> 1498.78s]  Okay, green tea.
[1498.88s -> 1500.08s]  All right, big fan.
[1500.08s -> 1502.38s]  I used to make it myself, but then I got lazy.
[1502.78s -> 1504.88s]  Well, that's exactly what I was just going to tell you to
[1504.88s -> 1505.18s]  do.
[1506.38s -> 1512.67s]  Yeah, I would do I would drink a few matches a day rather
[1512.67s -> 1513.77s]  than take you a day.
[1514.17s -> 1517.47s]  You know how much caffeine is in a macho not 200.
[1518.37s -> 1519.37s]  Are we like 40?
[1519.37s -> 1521.27s]  I'm telling you the 200 is fake.
[1523.82s -> 1525.92s]  Let me take it's not real.
[1526.72s -> 1529.32s]  It is 200 but like I'm saying like it's not it's not real.
[1529.32s -> 1529.82s]  It's not true.
[1529.82s -> 1530.42s]  It's not real.
[1530.52s -> 1531.32s]  I will rest here.
[1531.32s -> 1536.91s]  We did a full circle also if I literally take one sip of
[1536.91s -> 1538.01s]  like a five-hour energy.
[1538.41s -> 1538.81s]  Hmm.
[1539.51s -> 1541.71s]  That's what happened on myriad day.
[1541.91s -> 1546.41s]  I won a little sip of five-hour energy like like 1 20th
[1546.41s -> 1547.11s]  of a bottle.
[1547.61s -> 1551.01s]  It it fucks me up and I'm like wired and can't sleep for
[1551.01s -> 1552.01s]  a day or two where we're going.
[1553.91s -> 1557.21s]  Yeah, I I don't I one of the reasons why I can't drink
[1557.21s -> 1561.71s]  stuff like Red Bull really or five-hour energy or pretty
[1561.71s -> 1566.28s]  much anything that has the like just caffeine in it.
[1567.08s -> 1568.18s]  We are going the wrong way.
[1568.18s -> 1569.68s]  I yeah, but it's okay.
[1569.68s -> 1570.18s]  It's all right.
[1570.68s -> 1574.08s]  No, we've already been we did a full circle.
[1574.38s -> 1576.48s]  Wait, no, no, no, no, no trust trust cook.
[1576.58s -> 1578.38s]  They say cook keep cooking.
[1578.48s -> 1578.68s]  All right.
[1578.68s -> 1580.58s]  Well, then the other one that's at the stove.
[1580.58s -> 1581.08s]  Let's go.
[1582.34s -> 1582.54s]  Okay.
[1582.54s -> 1584.64s]  So everyone's like, what's the Duncan order?
[1584.64s -> 1585.34s]  What's the Duncan order?
[1585.34s -> 1587.74s]  Is this what I know we've been this way because we fought
[1587.74s -> 1589.64s]  a fucking great putrid slob up here.
[1590.24s -> 1593.74s]  We did and we're just going the long way back and around
[1593.74s -> 1597.74s]  in a complete circle to that sorcerer who is up here and
[1597.74s -> 1598.84s]  we could afford it there.
[1598.84s -> 1601.64s]  But you were at stove and I just kind of let you go.
[1602.04s -> 1603.64s]  I was serious thousand souls.
[1603.64s -> 1604.94s]  I feel like I should spend these.
[1605.04s -> 1605.24s]  All right.
[1605.24s -> 1606.54s]  We'll spend your souls.
[1612.26s -> 1615.26s]  We have we have switched personalities like for real.
[1615.96s -> 1616.16s]  All right.
[1616.16s -> 1620.06s]  So now we have to go like around this way like around here.
[1621.64s -> 1622.44s]  That's correct, right?
[1622.44s -> 1623.94s]  We go like around this right side.
[1627.50s -> 1628.10s]  That's correct.
[1629.58s -> 1633.68s]  I will follow you anywhere we go like, yeah, we want to
[1633.68s -> 1640.29s]  go like around let him bake.
[1642.47s -> 1644.97s]  Baking does take longer baking takes a little longer.
[1644.97s -> 1645.47s]  That's right.
[1646.92s -> 1649.42s]  Well, you want to go down into the fucking heroes grave.
[1649.52s -> 1652.12s]  We could the worst Dungeons and Elden ring.
[1653.02s -> 1655.42s]  Wait, is this the one that with the lava and the chariot?
[1656.30s -> 1658.70s]  I think this is actually yeah, this might be like one
[1658.70s -> 1660.90s]  of the worst most painful Dungeons in the game.
[1661.00s -> 1661.30s]  Yep.
[1661.60s -> 1662.10s]  I don't want to do it.
[1663.75s -> 1664.85s]  You're really going to nope out.
[1664.95s -> 1667.55s]  No, I think this is the worst Dungeon in Elden ring.
[1667.55s -> 1669.65s]  It's absolutely this is the worst Dungeon in the whole
[1669.65s -> 1669.95s]  game.
[1671.82s -> 1674.62s]  I think what with me randomly jumping and backstepping.
[1674.72s -> 1676.32s]  I think we can I think we can do it.
[1676.32s -> 1680.42s]  I think the last 15 minutes of this stream starting has
[1680.42s -> 1683.52s]  proven to me personally that we should not walk down
[1683.52s -> 1684.32s]  this hallway.
[1684.62s -> 1686.62s]  What if the chariots are randomized and like we don't
[1686.62s -> 1687.62s]  even have to worry about them.
[1688.79s -> 1689.79s]  All right, let's do it.
[1690.93s -> 1693.93s]  That actually that was enough for me to say.
[1693.93s -> 1694.53s]  Yeah, let's do it.
[1697.84s -> 1700.84s]  People watching my perspective seriously take note
[1700.84s -> 1702.04s]  of how many times I jump.
[1702.04s -> 1704.33s]  I have not done it on purpose once.
[1704.53s -> 1705.83s]  Oh, I thought you were just doing the thing where you
[1705.83s -> 1707.13s]  like jump around Ironforge.
[1707.50s -> 1709.30s]  No, every time I jump.
[1709.30s -> 1710.20s]  I think I'm running.
[1712.75s -> 1715.65s]  I think I'm doing something else and if I ever do this
[1715.65s -> 1717.05s]  sword, I think I'm blocking.
[1717.35s -> 1720.35s]  So what you're saying is now you have a great excuse
[1720.35s -> 1722.95s]  when you go back to Neo 2 after playing this for a
[1722.95s -> 1725.75s]  while, you can do like a 30 to 40 minute complaint
[1725.75s -> 1727.95s]  stream in the first 40 minutes of that stream talking
[1727.95s -> 1729.95s]  about how you relearned these abilities.
[1730.90s -> 1735.11s]  It's genius citizens.
[1735.78s -> 1737.61s]  Oh, all penis.
[1739.05s -> 1740.75s]  No, it's not there.
[1743.46s -> 1745.16s]  Okay, by the Duncan order.
[1745.86s -> 1749.56s]  It's a it's a large blueberry iced coffee with only
[1749.56s -> 1750.56s]  a few sugars.
[1750.86s -> 1752.16s]  Wait, wait yours.
[1752.16s -> 1754.36s]  You were gonna you said you were going to assess me
[1754.36s -> 1756.86s]  and your assessment of me was telling me to drink tea.
[1757.53s -> 1758.13s]  That was it.
[1758.13s -> 1759.93s]  That was I just want to go back for a second.
[1759.93s -> 1763.13s]  My assessment would be to tell you to stop taking caffeine
[1763.13s -> 1763.53s]  pills.
[1764.58s -> 1767.08s]  Okay, but what if I stop and then I like don't feel good
[1767.08s -> 1768.28s]  because I haven't taken one.
[1773.41s -> 1777.93s]  Well, okay, can they be can they be like cut in half?
[1779.12s -> 1779.42s]  Yeah.
[1780.29s -> 1782.19s]  All right, so I'm gonna have these before.
[1782.39s -> 1785.19s]  Yeah, so do that for a while and do then cut that in
[1785.19s -> 1788.49s]  half and then once you get used to like that 50 ish
[1788.49s -> 1790.76s]  milligrams, I think you're good.
[1790.76s -> 1791.86s]  Just drinking tea, man.
[1792.06s -> 1793.96s]  You don't got to do you don't gonna be caffeine pills
[1793.96s -> 1795.66s]  or watch out.
[1797.09s -> 1803.08s]  Oh, yeah, I forgot why did we come down here?
[1803.18s -> 1803.68s]  I don't know.
[1803.68s -> 1805.58s]  You want to be said it was gonna be randomized.
[1805.88s -> 1806.68s]  Oh fuck.
[1809.66s -> 1814.86s]  Do you not gonna make it you're gonna get fucking squished
[1814.86s -> 1815.96s]  to get on the way back.
[1817.26s -> 1817.96s]  How do I heal?
[1819.26s -> 1820.06s]  It's X.
[1821.19s -> 1822.89s]  How do I how do I equip it?
[1823.49s -> 1825.19s]  What do you mean down on the d-pad?
[1825.59s -> 1826.29s]  I'm jumping.
[1827.62s -> 1829.82s]  All right, you have fucking me up so bad.
[1829.82s -> 1830.82s]  You have no idea.
[1831.72s -> 1833.02s]  Did you just run you over again?
[1833.52s -> 1839.14s]  No, I don't want to lose my Amarita.
[1841.11s -> 1841.91s]  Are you down here?
[1842.11s -> 1842.61s]  I'm coming.
[1842.61s -> 1844.11s]  Yeah, you freaked me out so bad.
[1844.11s -> 1844.81s]  I didn't know what to do.
[1846.11s -> 1849.01s]  Yeah, because you were like freaking out and you were
[1849.01s -> 1851.61s]  all like you were like caffeinated and ran down here.
[1853.89s -> 1854.19s]  Okay.
[1854.19s -> 1856.49s]  I think you're weird that you drink more than one coffee
[1856.49s -> 1856.89s]  a day.
[1858.12s -> 1859.02s]  Coffee to me.
[1859.32s -> 1862.62s]  I'm not gonna lecture you in front of like all your fans
[1862.62s -> 1864.42s]  who are gonna like back you up and make me feel like.
[1865.92s -> 1866.62s]  Look what you've done.
[1866.72s -> 1867.42s]  Look what you've done.
[1867.82s -> 1868.22s]  We're good.
[1872.40s -> 1872.80s]  Okay.
[1874.41s -> 1876.90s]  Where are you trying to remember how to heal?
[1877.50s -> 1878.50s]  Okay, where do we go?
[1878.70s -> 1879.90s]  We're gonna go this way.
[1880.10s -> 1883.00s]  I think I don't you can go all the I went all the way down.
[1883.00s -> 1885.50s]  You can go down further and there's like cool items and
[1885.50s -> 1885.70s]  shit.
[1885.70s -> 1887.60s]  But I don't like we really care walk in the lava.
[1889.35s -> 1892.05s]  Yeah, I think if there's like a spot you can go down there.
[1892.05s -> 1892.85s]  Let's just go this way.
[1895.12s -> 1896.92s]  Is the chariot not one shot anymore?
[1900.23s -> 1900.63s]  I don't know.
[1901.03s -> 1903.83s]  Maybe we're supposed to be I do remember killing like I'm
[1903.83s -> 1905.13s]  surprised we live through one.
[1905.63s -> 1906.73s]  Yeah, that is weird.
[1908.12s -> 1908.72s]  But anyways.
[1910.32s -> 1913.22s]  Drinking coffee for me is this is kind of wow.
[1913.22s -> 1914.42s]  It is an important stone.
[1918.67s -> 1924.47s]  Coffee is more of a thing to kind of dip and relax within.
[1924.47s -> 1925.07s]  What is it?
[1925.77s -> 1928.27s]  I've never played a game worse on stream.
[1928.57s -> 1929.87s]  Every time I went to block.
[1929.87s -> 1931.07s]  I just drank an elixir.
[1931.37s -> 1934.47s]  I drank like three blasts to fight a rat when my health was
[1934.47s -> 1934.77s]  full.
[1935.07s -> 1937.17s]  So you really weren't kidding when you were like, hey, dude,
[1937.17s -> 1938.87s]  I really don't knock under the buttons help.
[1938.97s -> 1940.27s]  It's worse than I thought.
[1940.47s -> 1940.97s]  Wow.
[1941.97s -> 1944.73s]  I have like a good talent.
[1944.73s -> 1948.03s]  I'll say normally a talent for absolutely discarding any
[1948.03s -> 1950.13s]  information the moment I just like not useful.
[1951.03s -> 1953.93s]  Like I just started out during it's in the fucking recycle
[1953.93s -> 1954.23s]  bin.
[1954.53s -> 1955.83s]  That is really interesting.
[1963.19s -> 1966.35s]  That's how loud a little loud.
[1966.45s -> 1967.35s]  Why is it so loud?
[1967.95s -> 1968.75s]  Wasn't like this before.
[1969.74s -> 1970.04s]  All right.
[1970.04s -> 1977.18s]  But yeah, why is it so loud?
[1978.41s -> 1979.11s]  Okay, that's better.
[1981.72s -> 1983.65s]  Yeah, coffee.
[1983.65s -> 1986.35s]  I drink coffee not necessarily for the caffeine.
[1987.15s -> 1990.75s]  I like just kind of like sipping on something just like
[1990.75s -> 1991.95s]  a hot beverage.
[1991.95s -> 1992.95s]  You're like, oh, yeah, that's nice.
[1994.67s -> 1996.07s]  But most days it's whiskey.
[1997.07s -> 1998.27s]  That I'll be honest.
[1998.27s -> 2000.47s]  That's like another reason like oh whiskey.
[2000.47s -> 2001.67s]  Oh, I'm just gonna like that.
[2003.27s -> 2003.67s]  Whiskey.
[2003.67s -> 2005.07s]  I'm gonna drink it about loud.
[2005.84s -> 2010.14s]  What that did it that was I was a pretty loud for you.
[2010.14s -> 2011.34s]  Usually they're not that loud.
[2011.34s -> 2011.74s]  Really?
[2013.39s -> 2015.29s]  They hit me weird worse.
[2015.29s -> 2015.89s]  No, it that is.
[2015.89s -> 2017.69s]  Yeah, hit me weird.
[2017.89s -> 2019.79s]  You're farming for worse noise again.
[2020.09s -> 2027.37s]  I am actually like in real life did like Sonic damage to me.
[2030.10s -> 2032.30s]  Okay, you're fucking me up so bad.
[2032.50s -> 2035.60s]  I've drank more flasks in this dungeon that I have like the
[2035.60s -> 2037.40s]  entire time of playing Elden Ring.
[2039.30s -> 2040.40s]  Did you know you could do that?
[2041.20s -> 2042.40s]  Yeah, he didn't.
[2046.38s -> 2046.88s]  What now?
[2046.88s -> 2048.38s]  Dude, I don't remember.
[2049.65s -> 2050.65s]  Watch out the fire.
[2051.45s -> 2052.45s]  Oh, it's my little fire away.
[2052.45s -> 2054.35s]  Okay, watch out chariot.
[2054.65s -> 2057.05s]  I think we can we can follow this one up.
[2057.05s -> 2059.35s]  I think we wanted to but I don't know.
[2059.45s -> 2061.65s]  I'm afraid that's my fight the boss.
[2068.64s -> 2069.74s]  Okay, I'm gonna die.
[2074.97s -> 2076.07s]  Oh, that's not where that is.
[2077.21s -> 2077.81s]  Let's just leave.
[2079.11s -> 2079.71s]  Are you dying too?
[2079.71s -> 2080.01s]  Okay.
[2080.01s -> 2081.51s]  Yeah, let's let's fucking let's go.
[2081.61s -> 2085.91s]  I thought that you know that level where the this you can
[2085.91s -> 2089.91s]  go inside and there's like the two little places on either
[2089.91s -> 2093.08s]  side of the chariot that are down and you go in and I thought
[2093.08s -> 2093.88s]  it was right there.
[2095.08s -> 2096.18s]  Yeah, let's get the fuck out of here.
[2097.21s -> 2107.65s]  Like immediately it was the right place, but it was the
[2107.65s -> 2108.45s]  wrong side.
[2108.45s -> 2109.65s]  Oh shit, whatever.
[2115.92s -> 2118.52s]  But yeah coffee is more of a sipping thing just like this.
[2118.82s -> 2120.12s]  This is like hydration.
[2121.77s -> 2123.77s]  I just like I got to move my hands around.
[2127.64s -> 2130.74s]  I relate to the move your hands around but not the put it
[2130.74s -> 2131.74s]  in my mouth part.
[2131.84s -> 2135.52s]  Well, the thing is it's really good that I and like I know
[2135.52s -> 2138.22s]  that like obviously like cigarettes are one of those things
[2138.22s -> 2140.12s]  a lot of people go like yeah, I just always I kind of wanted
[2140.12s -> 2142.32s]  to have something just like in my hand and like something
[2142.32s -> 2145.12s]  to do with my hand and whatever and I'm so glad that I
[2145.12s -> 2148.22s]  never ever ever thought to try cigarettes because I probably
[2148.22s -> 2149.52s]  would one of those be one of those people that was like,
[2149.52s -> 2152.22s]  oh, yeah, I just needed to have it in my hand just something
[2152.22s -> 2152.72s]  to do.
[2154.22s -> 2156.42s]  I'm glad I never fucking ever thought to ever do it.
[2159.52s -> 2160.42s]  You gonna kill this crowd?
[2167.54s -> 2168.84s]  What are you doing over there?
[2176.55s -> 2178.35s]  It's worse than I'm self-aware.
[2178.65s -> 2182.55s]  It's like the self-consciousness of what I'm doing is making
[2182.55s -> 2183.25s]  it work.
[2185.16s -> 2186.76s]  I'm giving myself a headache.
[2186.76s -> 2188.56s]  You sure those are caffeine pills?
[2189.76s -> 2190.56s]  Something else?
[2192.76s -> 2196.36s]  I just cast bops barrier like six times and tried to cast
[2196.36s -> 2199.86s]  a face thing with my staff like for this thing is actually
[2199.86s -> 2200.36s]  kind of hard.
[2200.36s -> 2201.16s]  We need to be careful.
[2203.52s -> 2205.72s]  He's taking mystery pills.
[2208.24s -> 2210.54s]  He's taking mystery pills.
[2214.65s -> 2215.15s]  I got it.
[2222.26s -> 2222.56s]  All right.
[2222.56s -> 2222.76s]  All right.
[2222.76s -> 2223.26s]  Hey, all right.
[2223.26s -> 2223.56s]  It's all right.
[2223.56s -> 2223.76s]  It's all right.
[2223.76s -> 2224.46s]  Here's what we're going to do.
[2225.06s -> 2226.76s]  You just go.
[2227.26s -> 2228.16s]  I got I got it.
[2228.76s -> 2230.96s]  You know, what's probably better?
[2231.96s -> 2233.06s]  I got a suggestion for you.
[2233.46s -> 2234.76s]  I am trying to keep home.
[2236.16s -> 2238.66s]  What if you went into and change the key vines to make it
[2238.66s -> 2239.56s]  just Neo 2?
[2240.92s -> 2242.22s]  No, you sure?
[2242.72s -> 2245.13s]  I'm sure that's not a good idea.
[2246.00s -> 2252.64s]  That's actually a really good idea because then you don't
[2252.64s -> 2253.54s]  even have to think about it.
[2253.54s -> 2254.54s]  Run is the same button.
[2254.54s -> 2255.54s]  Jump is the same button.
[2255.54s -> 2257.84s]  Swing is the same button and that thing is actually pretty
[2257.84s -> 2258.04s]  good.
[2258.04s -> 2258.44s]  Isn't it?
[2261.70s -> 2263.60s]  I don't I don't I don't know.
[2263.70s -> 2264.80s]  This sounds dangerous.
[2267.25s -> 2267.75s]  What do you mean?
[2269.04s -> 2269.64s]  Oh changing.
[2269.64s -> 2275.10s]  I don't know why but it sounds dangerous and I kind of want
[2275.10s -> 2275.80s]  to overcome it.
[2275.80s -> 2279.20s]  This is like the getting over it that kind of game.
[2279.20s -> 2280.20s]  Well, there's a time for you to do it.
[2280.20s -> 2281.20s]  It's definitely right now.
[2282.90s -> 2283.20s]  Okay.
[2283.20s -> 2285.78s]  So now make sure we're going the right way.
[2293.16s -> 2295.82s]  I wish I could see the freaking map.
[2297.72s -> 2300.22s]  You just I'm going to see I need you to lead for a bit.
[2300.22s -> 2301.72s]  Now we take a left back you up.
[2301.92s -> 2302.72s]  There's a boss up here.
[2302.72s -> 2303.12s]  Isn't it?
[2303.72s -> 2304.02s]  Let's go.
[2304.02s -> 2305.02s]  There might be an item up here.
[2307.49s -> 2308.59s]  Can you handle climbing this ladder?
[2309.75s -> 2311.92s]  We'll see you want me to go first.
[2312.12s -> 2313.42s]  I would like for you to go first.
[2321.90s -> 2322.90s]  We're all good.
[2323.60s -> 2325.80s]  Part of it was hoping that you were going to get sniped.
[2326.30s -> 2326.80s]  I am good.
[2326.80s -> 2329.40s]  Like if we go into a boss fight and you die, I am going to
[2329.40s -> 2332.10s]  try harder than I've ever tried of the game to like beat it
[2332.10s -> 2332.60s]  anyway.
[2334.00s -> 2336.10s]  Just just so I can be the winner.
[2337.10s -> 2337.60s]  That's fine.
[2338.54s -> 2339.14s]  It's a good thing.
[2339.64s -> 2340.24s]  That's good.
[2341.54s -> 2345.34s]  So I may be completely incompetent, but I have the like
[2347.88s -> 2350.38s]  the burning desire and that usually works for anime.
[2356.15s -> 2357.05s]  Oh, okay.
[2358.25s -> 2358.65s]  Keep going.
[2359.39s -> 2359.99s]  Let's do a race.
[2359.99s -> 2360.49s]  Wait ready?
[2362.04s -> 2362.44s]  Hold on.
[2363.14s -> 2363.64s]  We didn't do it.
[2364.70s -> 2367.30s]  You're going to win any race because I'm going to jump
[2367.30s -> 2368.00s]  instead of run.
[2369.28s -> 2372.90s]  That's better jump.
[2373.54s -> 2374.44s]  It'll be funny jump.
[2375.86s -> 2376.56s]  I almost just did it.
[2377.26s -> 2378.46s]  I almost just did it.
[2379.26s -> 2380.66s]  I was thinking it was weird.
[2380.66s -> 2382.16s]  My whole body was like I'm going to do it.
[2382.66s -> 2383.86s]  Kill yourself.
[2383.96s -> 2386.56s]  I was like, I'm going to jump off that for no reason.
[2387.36s -> 2401.98s]  Watch out that I thought he was going to walk off.
[2404.96s -> 2407.43s]  No, I'm here to game.
[2410.03s -> 2412.23s]  Are you going to stacking bonus for the amount of things
[2412.23s -> 2414.43s]  that you kill before returning to the shrine and praying?
[2419.28s -> 2420.38s]  So I like don't want to get hit.
[2422.40s -> 2428.79s]  Is that oh, that's a as a neo reference shout out.
[2432.52s -> 2435.10s]  I'm just going to brace the jumping.
[2435.50s -> 2436.40s]  Are we going uphill?
[2436.70s -> 2437.10s]  Excuse me.
[2437.10s -> 2439.60s]  I'm walking in my we have gone around like we need to turn
[2439.60s -> 2440.60s]  way to go like on the road.
[2443.71s -> 2444.11s]  I know.
[2445.91s -> 2446.61s]  I got an epic.
[2447.11s -> 2447.81s]  Did you epic?
[2448.81s -> 2449.21s]  Hold on.
[2449.21s -> 2451.51s]  I've got something that you are going to want to take a look
[2451.51s -> 2451.91s]  at.
[2452.68s -> 2455.48s]  I got the staff that I used a lot of the game.
[2455.48s -> 2456.58s]  It's really sick.
[2456.58s -> 2459.78s]  I don't I have every staff in the game and one spell.
[2459.78s -> 2461.68s]  I have gravity pole or whatever.
[2461.68s -> 2464.08s]  But this one is the one that makes your spells cast way
[2464.08s -> 2464.68s]  faster.
[2465.58s -> 2467.58s]  This is the Azores glint stone staff.
[2469.20s -> 2470.80s]  It reduces the casting it.
[2471.60s -> 2472.00s]  All right.
[2472.40s -> 2475.30s]  Yeah, you can climb that tower and throw it off.
[2477.94s -> 2480.24s]  It's like just javelin it over the edge.
[2480.74s -> 2481.04s]  Yep.
[2481.34s -> 2481.74s]  All right.
[2483.90s -> 2484.30s]  All right.
[2484.60s -> 2485.70s]  There's a boss up here.
[2486.54s -> 2487.54s]  Yeah, are you prepared?
[2487.54s -> 2490.14s]  Hell, well all the way over the top is normally the
[2491.04s -> 2494.84s]  meteorite meteor man and for us, it's going to be redone
[2495.83s -> 2496.13s]  now.
[2496.13s -> 2498.23s]  It actually would be really bad if it was like Eldon Beast
[2498.33s -> 2500.13s]  if it okay if Eldon Beast is in the middle of this.
[2500.13s -> 2500.93s]  I'm going to wait.
[2500.93s -> 2501.93s]  You're just going to go to bed.
[2503.76s -> 2504.66s]  I'm going to go to bed.
[2504.76s -> 2507.66s]  No, I'm you're going to die and I'm going to focus so hard
[2507.66s -> 2510.26s]  and you're going to see me jump and cast stops barrier at
[2510.26s -> 2510.76s]  nothing.
[2511.46s -> 2512.56s]  But I'm still going to beat it.
[2512.76s -> 2515.34s]  Okay, it's going to be you.
[2515.54s -> 2517.14s]  Oh my god, please don't say that.
[2520.58s -> 2521.18s]  Are you prepared?
[2521.18s -> 2521.48s]  Huh?
[2522.12s -> 2522.72s]  Are you prepared?
[2522.72s -> 2523.02s]  Huh?
[2534.18s -> 2535.58s]  I'm keep holding it.
[2536.28s -> 2536.98s]  It's rough.
[2537.08s -> 2537.78s]  I'm sorry.
[2538.81s -> 2539.11s]  All right.
[2539.61s -> 2542.01s]  I'll get over saying it soon.
[2545.32s -> 2546.82s]  You're supposed to dodge roll in this game.
[2556.02s -> 2557.92s]  Okay, you know when you were asking me about Neo, I think
[2557.92s -> 2559.32s]  this is actually the best comparison.
[2559.62s -> 2561.72s]  Your first couple hours are going to be like this.
[2563.02s -> 2563.82s]  I'm dead.
[2566.29s -> 2569.09s]  I just saw you jump over that that actually helped you
[2569.09s -> 2569.89s]  you jumped over it.
[2569.89s -> 2570.59s]  You didn't dodge it.
[2571.94s -> 2573.04s]  Oh, I've got him now.
[2575.15s -> 2576.15s]  Oh my god.
[2576.15s -> 2578.55s]  We are so don't die.
[2578.55s -> 2580.15s]  This is so fucking far away, dude.
[2580.82s -> 2581.72s]  I can't die.
[2582.61s -> 2583.21s]  Got him.
[2585.94s -> 2586.74s]  Holy shit.
[2586.74s -> 2587.64s]  This is so far away.
[2588.14s -> 2588.44s]  Sorry.
[2588.44s -> 2590.84s]  I looked over your chat stir not even helping the chimera
[2590.84s -> 2591.44s]  is dead.
[2592.60s -> 2596.70s]  Yeah, well you took you have like a legend next to your
[2596.70s -> 2599.50s]  computer of like all the buttons written down while I
[2599.50s -> 2601.40s]  was dodging and attacking and fighting and he was kicking
[2601.40s -> 2604.20s]  the shit out of me and you looked at your legend of moves
[2604.20s -> 2606.70s]  you could do and then like 15 to 30 seconds later you
[2606.70s -> 2612.01s]  decided to help I kept there was a giant great wolf those
[2612.01s -> 2613.41s]  wolves die in one hit.
[2613.81s -> 2615.01s]  No, that's one of the big wolves.
[2615.01s -> 2615.81s]  It took a lot of hits.
[2618.15s -> 2619.35s]  Are you climbing you coming back?
[2619.55s -> 2620.85s]  I don't think you understand how far away I am.
[2622.55s -> 2625.15s]  I am at the Gellmer's hero grave.
[2625.15s -> 2626.55s]  That's the last bonfire we got.
[2627.05s -> 2630.57s]  Oh, I thought there was a bonfire right here.
[2631.83s -> 2632.23s]  Did you get it?
[2632.23s -> 2632.93s]  Because I didn't get it.
[2635.12s -> 2636.32s]  May just be up the hill a bit.
[2636.62s -> 2638.02s]  I know there's like a midway point.
[2638.96s -> 2639.96s]  All right, I'll be good.
[2640.26s -> 2643.52s]  Okay, you'd better be good.
[2643.92s -> 2647.61s]  I'm on my way this time.
[2647.61s -> 2649.01s]  I'm just going to get right over there.
[2650.34s -> 2654.70s]  No stopping at the maps.
[2655.30s -> 2658.00s]  Yeah, that's I don't know that I think that might be a
[2658.00s -> 2659.20s]  little much for stir right now.
[2672.77s -> 2679.62s]  We'll get this one at least and wait.
[2679.62s -> 2680.32s]  I've never played Elden ring.
[2680.32s -> 2681.32s]  Can I get a spoiler warning?
[2681.92s -> 2682.52s]  Oh shit.
[2682.62s -> 2682.92s]  Yep.
[2685.80s -> 2686.90s]  Stir will write it on history.
[2689.21s -> 2689.91s]  What does that mean?
[2691.29s -> 2693.09s]  Someone was wanted a spoiler warning because they haven't
[2693.09s -> 2694.69s]  played this part and I said that you would just put it
[2694.69s -> 2695.09s]  on yours.
[2695.97s -> 2697.27s]  Okay, that's on mine.
[2700.58s -> 2702.98s]  My stream has the there's the twitch plug-in where anything
[2702.98s -> 2704.98s]  that you haven't seen before in a game is covered with
[2704.98s -> 2705.88s]  like a black box.
[2706.99s -> 2708.39s]  That's so stupid.
[2711.60s -> 2716.36s]  Oh, the spoiler extension.
[2720.36s -> 2721.36s]  Oh, hey, welcome back.
[2721.76s -> 2724.76s]  I'm back good of you to show up and finally start helping.
[2725.16s -> 2725.66s]  I know.
[2727.22s -> 2727.62s]  All right.
[2727.72s -> 2729.42s]  So we just got to get her.
[2729.42s -> 2731.22s]  I think there's a bonfire somewhere over here.
[2735.04s -> 2736.94s]  I just finished making a cardboard cut out of you and
[2736.94s -> 2738.24s]  watches me when I sleep.
[2738.54s -> 2739.74s]  That's not strange at all.
[2742.42s -> 2744.42s]  I thought there was like another ladder here.
[2747.60s -> 2752.01s]  You should jump you thought I was going to it's the last
[2752.01s -> 2753.01s]  thing they would expect.
[2754.78s -> 2755.58s]  All right, so we got it.
[2755.58s -> 2764.00s]  Let's go over this down here.
[2764.00s -> 2764.30s]  All right.
[2764.30s -> 2767.64s]  Well, I think we keep going on the ladders right the ladder
[2767.64s -> 2767.94s]  right here.
[2767.94s -> 2768.44s]  Right here.
[2768.44s -> 2768.64s]  I know.
[2768.64s -> 2768.84s]  I know.
[2768.84s -> 2772.14s]  I know, but I think I think there's a bonfire though.
[2772.34s -> 2773.24s]  I knew where to go.
[2773.34s -> 2773.94s]  No, it's up here.
[2774.44s -> 2774.94s]  You're wrong.
[2774.94s -> 2779.10s]  I knew where to go with those coffee.
[2779.10s -> 2779.90s]  Drank is kicking in.
[2782.56s -> 2783.96s]  I swear this one like right here.
[2786.19s -> 2788.19s]  Yeah, I think it we are going to go up one more.
[2789.96s -> 2792.50s]  Oh, this is just ladder zone.
[2798.56s -> 2799.06s]  I like it.
[2811.88s -> 2812.78s]  You need to help your friend.
[2814.36s -> 2814.86s]  My friend.
[2816.25s -> 2818.35s]  What I said you need to help your friend.
[2820.06s -> 2823.80s]  I'm beyond helping you need to help him.
[2825.46s -> 2825.86s]  No.
[2826.46s -> 2826.86s]  All right.
[2827.06s -> 2827.56s]  Watch out.
[2829.33s -> 2830.03s]  I think we yeah, we go.
[2830.03s -> 2830.73s]  I can do it.
[2831.13s -> 2832.03s]  I think you're all right.
[2832.03s -> 2834.53s]  I think you just maybe were a little nervous that you had
[2834.53s -> 2835.93s]  to relearn and get the game.
[2843.39s -> 2844.19s]  Everything seems fine.
[2846.50s -> 2857.44s]  Do you have some enemies special enemies got some
[2857.44s -> 2860.74s]  Herba do you need any Herba is already something like
[2860.74s -> 2861.94s]  shooting this from a mile away.
[2863.53s -> 2864.93s]  Oh the flower beware.
[2865.13s -> 2868.03s]  I thought that was actually like falling stars in the sky
[2868.03s -> 2869.73s]  and I was like, oh, that's that's a cool environmental
[2869.73s -> 2870.13s]  effect.
[2870.23s -> 2870.93s]  I should grab me.
[2870.93s -> 2871.73s]  I thought I could hit it.
[2872.73s -> 2873.63s]  You're so dead.
[2873.63s -> 2876.63s]  You're I thought you were getting pelted by everything
[2877.03s -> 2878.03s]  kind of was but I'm all right.
[2878.73s -> 2879.73s]  We fighting this.
[2880.23s -> 2884.93s]  Oh, I mean no, but that's destructible.
[2886.89s -> 2888.19s]  This thing is that these things are so annoying.
[2888.29s -> 2888.89s]  I say no.
[2891.50s -> 2895.18s]  Just get the heck out of here across the bridge and then
[2895.18s -> 2896.58s]  there's a bonfire right here.
[2897.28s -> 2900.68s]  Yes, there is and then we fight whatever is up here.
[2901.75s -> 2902.15s]  All right.
[2902.15s -> 2904.25s]  Let's both take a guess and if one of us gets this right
[2904.25s -> 2907.05s]  then we all the other one 50 bucks.
[2908.37s -> 2911.07s]  It's kind of weird that you like booted up your game early
[2911.07s -> 2912.57s]  just to see what was up here pretend.
[2912.57s -> 2917.07s]  You don't have any of these graces for $50.
[2919.01s -> 2921.41s]  Yeah, I'm gonna all right.
[2921.41s -> 2923.61s]  I'm gonna say it's gonna be we haven't.
[2923.81s -> 2926.61s]  I'm just saying I've said for Don I don't think it would
[2926.61s -> 2930.41s]  be it would be in the lore for him to be inside the crater
[2930.81s -> 2931.61s]  probability wise.
[2931.61s -> 2934.41s]  We have not seen really that many ulcerated tree spirits
[2934.41s -> 2935.51s]  and there's like 10 in the game.
[2935.51s -> 2939.87s]  So I'm going to say an ulcerated tree spirit statistically
[2939.87s -> 2940.17s]  speaking.
[2940.17s -> 2941.27s]  That's where I have the most odds.
[2946.46s -> 2953.59s]  It's oh that way that could have an urge tree avatar full
[2953.59s -> 2955.59s]  grown or tree avatar though.
[2958.96s -> 2961.46s]  Yeah, this is a safe bet to this in the ulcerated tree spirits.
[2961.46s -> 2962.56s]  We've only seen like two of these.
[2968.11s -> 2975.94s]  I know a lot of hell.
[2976.24s -> 2988.21s]  Oh shit.
[2988.21s -> 2989.91s]  I tried to dodge that didn't time it right.
[2995.56s -> 2996.36s]  That was weird.
[2997.16s -> 2998.56s]  That was really weird.
[3001.17s -> 3002.47s]  I did not appreciate it.
[3004.56s -> 3007.26s]  You know that you you dodge faster if you're in low stance.
[3008.94s -> 3010.34s]  What the fuck did I just get?
[3011.04s -> 3014.54s]  Yeah, I got a I got a weapon blue feathered branch sword.
[3015.14s -> 3016.34s]  I've never seen this item.
[3020.93s -> 3022.03s]  Are you going to take a look at this?
[3025.74s -> 3026.44s]  That's pretty rare.
[3042.33s -> 3044.43s]  Well, you thought he was drinking a flask?
[3051.23s -> 3053.73s]  His staff on my screen went like behind his body.
[3053.73s -> 3055.93s]  So it just looks like he put his hand to his empty head.
[3055.93s -> 3056.83s]  I was like he's drinking.
[3056.83s -> 3057.53s]  God damn it.
[3057.53s -> 3058.53s]  I don't want him to heal.
[3058.53s -> 3060.33s]  That would be so funny if they could do that.
[3061.56s -> 3062.06s]  All right.
[3062.46s -> 3063.26s]  Hold on a minute.
[3063.86s -> 3064.96s]  What did I just get?
[3065.76s -> 3067.96s]  I got like a weird rare key thing.
[3069.02s -> 3069.72s]  Is it a weapon?
[3071.66s -> 3072.66s]  I think I got a pot.
[3073.36s -> 3074.36s]  Was that actually a sword?
[3076.58s -> 3077.28s]  What the hell was there?
[3078.98s -> 3079.98s]  It's a talisman.
[3085.68s -> 3087.68s]  Raises defense when HP is low.
[3088.50s -> 3090.60s]  And then the other one was a talisman too, wasn't it?
[3094.52s -> 3095.52s]  What the hell was that other thing?
[3099.33s -> 3100.13s]  Did I get this thing?
[3101.80s -> 3103.60s]  I think we're in the fire zone though.
[3103.80s -> 3104.80s]  I think I'm all right with this.
[3110.95s -> 3112.45s]  Omen burn.
[3112.95s -> 3113.65s]  Oh, yeah.
[3113.75s -> 3114.45s]  I think it's a key though.
[3114.95s -> 3115.95s]  I don't even know what that thing does.
[3115.95s -> 3116.45s]  All right, cool.
[3116.85s -> 3120.55s]  I know that we're looking for like smithing stone fives.
[3120.95s -> 3122.35s]  It's my my breakpoint.
[3122.45s -> 3122.85s]  Hey.
[3124.56s -> 3129.22s]  Just want to let you know what take a look what's on the ground.
[3130.02s -> 3130.72s]  No, seven.
[3130.72s -> 3132.72s]  I do smithing seven on the ground.
[3134.46s -> 3134.66s]  Yeah.
[3134.66s -> 3135.66s]  No, I need sevens.
[3136.26s -> 3138.36s]  Oh, I thought I was helping you and have those back.
[3140.07s -> 3141.89s]  No, let's go.
[3142.29s -> 3142.79s]  Are we going?
[3142.89s -> 3143.99s]  How do we get to Volcano Manor?
[3143.99s -> 3144.19s]  All right.
[3144.19s -> 3145.79s]  Now we continue this way.
[3146.88s -> 3150.48s]  We have to go over like here.
[3150.48s -> 3153.48s]  Oh, yeah, there's like a walkway over here.
[3157.94s -> 3159.94s]  It's not it's like over here.
[3166.99s -> 3171.02s]  Old needle gravity stone fans.
[3171.32s -> 3171.92s]  Oh, yeah.
[3171.92s -> 3176.46s]  So you said you do not care at all about about magic anything,
[3176.46s -> 3176.76s]  right?
[3179.75s -> 3184.25s]  I would like some magic to cast potentially because I have a
[3184.25s -> 3188.70s]  couple of talismans that you probably want to have smithing
[3188.70s -> 3189.40s]  stone sevens.
[3189.40s -> 3190.00s]  Maybe I do.
[3191.19s -> 3194.09s]  I feel like you looked a bunch of times last dream and didn't
[3195.23s -> 3195.93s]  take a look on the ground.
[3203.44s -> 3204.54s]  Oh shit.
[3204.54s -> 3206.04s]  Who's your who's your favorite friend?
[3207.96s -> 3208.56s]  I see you.
[3209.36s -> 3209.66s]  Okay.
[3209.76s -> 3210.16s]  Yep.
[3210.26s -> 3212.96s]  No, no one else has given me smithing stone sevens, dude.
[3212.96s -> 3215.46s]  You just got frenzy flamed by the three fingers.
[3217.46s -> 3219.66s]  You just got fucking three fingered bro.
[3227.01s -> 3229.71s]  No, that's an e3 fucking presentation.
[3231.21s -> 3233.21s]  This is the e3 co-op presentation.
[3233.81s -> 3237.01s]  Dude, you got three frenzy fingered by the three fingers.
[3237.31s -> 3240.01s]  Whatever the fuck you said that was the e3 presentation.
[3241.68s -> 3244.68s]  You watch out you're gonna get frenzied by the three fingers.
[3244.98s -> 3247.38s]  You're just trying to distract from the fact that I don't know
[3247.38s -> 3249.18s]  any of the buttons and you've died more times.
[3249.88s -> 3252.38s]  Yeah, but I have to like help you.
[3252.38s -> 3254.98s]  I have to like guide somebody is lagging the game by the way.
[3255.98s -> 3257.88s]  Somebody there's like DDoS.
[3257.98s -> 3262.24s]  No, there's another one of those like look over here and the
[3262.24s -> 3265.54s]  game goes to 10 FPS creatures like a like a look at me.
[3266.04s -> 3267.24s]  Yeah, there's a look at me.
[3268.04s -> 3268.24s]  All right.
[3268.24s -> 3269.34s]  Let's are you are we going?
[3270.40s -> 3271.60s]  Are we wait?
[3272.50s -> 3274.20s]  I'm not the one who got three fingered.
[3277.33s -> 3282.63s]  You being like delirious tired is making me delirious tired
[3282.73s -> 3284.13s]  and I had a full night's sleep.
[3284.33s -> 3286.43s]  I had like avocado tacos.
[3286.73s -> 3288.83s]  I had like a nice coffee.
[3289.03s -> 3290.83s]  I have a foot fully hydrated.
[3290.83s -> 3292.13s]  I'm fully well rested.
[3293.03s -> 3294.93s]  You're turning me sleep-deprived.
[3296.10s -> 3300.00s]  I wish I had a knob that I could turn and just become sleepy
[3300.90s -> 3302.40s]  or like, you know, like a mood controller.
[3302.40s -> 3303.60s]  I wish I was a robot.
[3304.10s -> 3309.36s]  You know, I'd sell my soul to Ubisoft and they could plug me
[3309.36s -> 3312.46s]  in, you know, how just how amazing that would actually be
[3313.06s -> 3314.96s]  if you could truly control just like, you know what?
[3314.96s -> 3316.06s]  It's time for me to go to bed.
[3316.56s -> 3319.16s]  I can like go up into my internal like hard drive up here
[3319.16s -> 3322.96s]  and be like turn off and turn back on actually every terrible
[3322.96s -> 3325.36s]  what if like it was like an emergency yourself.
[3326.03s -> 3327.73s]  Yeah, I need a quick reboot guys.
[3327.83s -> 3330.03s]  Yeah, my like Wi-Fi is off.
[3332.53s -> 3337.43s]  I could go for some like mind control slash like invasion
[3337.43s -> 3340.23s]  of privacy like give up all my data type of situation
[3340.73s -> 3343.83s]  if it meant that I could be sleepy when I want to.
[3347.29s -> 3348.39s]  It's an avocado taco.
[3348.39s -> 3349.29s]  It's just a taco.
[3350.49s -> 3353.09s]  Like I would take the risk that the communists could totally
[3353.09s -> 3358.29s]  like activate me at any time as a soldier if it meant that
[3358.29s -> 3361.19s]  I could like control my my being.
[3362.43s -> 3364.73s]  It's like I know the communists.
[3365.53s -> 3365.93s]  All right.
[3366.43s -> 3371.06s]  Isn't it one of these illusory wall eventually all the way
[3371.06s -> 3372.66s]  down at the end here.
[3375.22s -> 3376.92s]  You have to go in one of the rooms because you can't even
[3376.92s -> 3378.02s]  I think we have to talk first.
[3378.02s -> 3379.42s]  We have to like say, yes, we're here.
[3383.14s -> 3384.24s]  Well, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[3384.24s -> 3384.44s]  wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[3384.44s -> 3385.04s]  wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[3387.48s -> 3391.08s]  this is the guy upstairs who drops the thing if we could go
[3391.08s -> 3392.98s]  kill the guy and see if he drops on Elsa.
[3392.98s -> 3394.08s]  I don't know if you want to do that.
[3394.58s -> 3395.48s]  I like this outfit.
[3395.98s -> 3396.88s]  You got to join the manor.
[3398.38s -> 3398.58s]  All right.
[3398.58s -> 3399.58s]  So we join the manor.
[3399.88s -> 3401.48s]  She gave me two golden seeds.
[3401.58s -> 3402.38s]  Join the manor.
[3403.18s -> 3404.08s]  I'm having twins.
[3407.28s -> 3408.08s]  And a bell bearing.
[3408.78s -> 3409.28s]  Nice.
[3409.38s -> 3409.68s]  All right.
[3409.68s -> 3410.68s]  And then we go upstairs.
[3411.28s -> 3411.58s]  Yeah.
[3411.58s -> 3413.38s]  And there is that person to fight.
[3414.58s -> 3415.08s]  It goes
[3418.98s -> 3419.98s]  just like Bloodborne.
[3420.48s -> 3421.28s]  You get invaded.
[3423.92s -> 3427.02s]  Oh, Amidala or whatever.
[3427.02s -> 3428.32s]  He says, you know,
[3429.32s -> 3433.32s]  Oh, Amidala, have mercy on the poor boy.
[3434.47s -> 3436.17s]  Of course, for some reason.
[3437.96s -> 3440.06s]  Have mercy on the poor bastard.
[3440.06s -> 3440.76s]  I think that's what it is.
[3446.02s -> 3447.22s]  Why this?
[3448.12s -> 3450.32s]  This guy has like 10 million health.
[3451.62s -> 3452.32s]  What is going on?
[3454.17s -> 3454.87s]  It has a lot of health.
[3454.97s -> 3457.07s]  No, it's being healed.
[3458.43s -> 3460.83s]  Oh, because he seems to have the beast magic.
[3460.93s -> 3462.13s]  There's a beast heal.
[3462.13s -> 3463.53s]  I'm just seriously jumping everything.
[3463.53s -> 3464.03s]  Magic.
[3465.17s -> 3465.97s]  Beast magic.
[3468.04s -> 3468.54s]  Can't hit me.
[3468.54s -> 3469.44s]  I'm a jumper now.
[3471.60s -> 3473.60s]  Why is my stamina going down when I keep hold?
[3474.10s -> 3475.00s]  I've helped.
[3475.87s -> 3476.57s]  You're not helping.
[3477.17s -> 3479.07s]  All the help that's been taken off in the last 15 straight
[3479.07s -> 3480.27s]  seconds has been me, not you.
[3482.39s -> 3483.59s]  I'm doubting that.
[3484.19s -> 3486.79s]  Oh, dude, look at that.
[3488.52s -> 3488.92s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[3488.92s -> 3489.52s]  I'm going to use it.
[3490.52s -> 3490.82s]  Ready?
[3490.82s -> 3491.42s]  Oh, you're good.
[3491.62s -> 3492.92s]  Oh, you're going to want to take a look at this.
[3494.59s -> 3495.89s]  Yes.
[3496.39s -> 3497.89s]  You just clean yourself with soap.
[3497.89s -> 3498.19s]  Yeah.
[3511.25s -> 3512.65s]  First shower in months.
[3512.65s -> 3512.95s]  Yeah.
[3517.08s -> 3517.28s]  Okay.
[3517.28s -> 3519.08s]  So now we wait a minute.
[3528.13s -> 3528.93s]  Don't get mad.
[3529.03s -> 3529.83s]  I was very excited.
[3531.63s -> 3532.03s]  Okay.
[3532.33s -> 3535.63s]  So the door should be open technically now, right?
[3536.43s -> 3537.13s]  One second.
[3542.56s -> 3542.86s]  No.
[3542.86s -> 3543.36s]  Oh, this one is.
[3549.13s -> 3549.73s]  Do you have to come back?
[3552.11s -> 3555.21s]  No, you got to, you know, yeah.
[3556.31s -> 3556.91s]  We do.
[3556.91s -> 3558.11s]  I think we have to reload the area.
[3559.88s -> 3560.98s]  Oh, you might be right.
[3563.87s -> 3565.57s]  You didn't get the drawing room key.
[3565.57s -> 3567.47s]  We don't have the key to get in here.
[3569.34s -> 3570.14s]  Oh, right.
[3570.44s -> 3571.54s]  She does give a key.
[3574.54s -> 3575.14s]  Oh, yeah.
[3576.14s -> 3577.04s]  So we don't have it.
[3577.24s -> 3578.14s]  So now what?
[3584.19s -> 3585.19s]  That's a good question.
[3586.86s -> 3588.56s]  I know there's multiple ways to get in there.
[3588.56s -> 3589.36s]  There's a different week.
[3589.36s -> 3591.06s]  I think we can go like around here.
[3592.04s -> 3592.74s]  Let's get the map.
[3597.64s -> 3598.74s]  I think we can go around the whole thing.
[3604.25s -> 3606.75s]  Take the teleporter at the bottom of Ray Lucaria.
[3607.25s -> 3608.05s]  We did that.
[3608.35s -> 3609.25s]  Yeah, we did that.
[3609.25s -> 3611.15s]  But were we supposed to go a different way from there?
[3618.41s -> 3621.21s]  Yeah, we got we got killed at the bottom and we we have a
[3621.51s -> 3622.41s]  teleporter down there.
[3622.41s -> 3623.81s]  Is it safe to drop down here?
[3627.47s -> 3627.97s]  No.
[3630.22s -> 3633.68s]  Oh, I want to do it so bad.
[3633.68s -> 3634.58s]  I'm just so lazy.
[3638.35s -> 3639.05s]  It's too far.
[3639.05s -> 3639.75s]  I was testing it.
[3642.04s -> 3643.24s]  That was a good test.
[3643.54s -> 3644.04s]  I'll wait.
[3655.60s -> 3656.00s]  Ready?
[3656.00s -> 3656.80s]  Be careful.
[3658.16s -> 3661.20s]  I am ready.
[3661.20s -> 3662.10s]  Be careful.
[3662.50s -> 3666.72s]  But that's how it went for you every time too, right?
[3668.61s -> 3669.51s]  I can't remember.
[3671.69s -> 3678.68s]  Give Bloodborne on PC with a new DLC and a bunch of new weapons.
[3682.84s -> 3685.44s]  Oh, that's so that's one of the so-called fall jokes.
[3685.64s -> 3686.64s]  Interesting.
[3688.73s -> 3690.33s]  Are you studying my stream?
[3692.22s -> 3693.42s]  Why are you studying me?
[3695.70s -> 3697.20s]  Well, apparently you're interesting.
[3697.20s -> 3699.10s]  There's a replacement German every now and again.
[3700.37s -> 3702.27s]  Interesting writing notes.
[3704.51s -> 3705.91s]  Okay, so I gotta go a long way.
[3706.61s -> 3707.11s]  Fine.
[3708.81s -> 3712.11s]  You still haven't killed any of these invisible dung beetles.
[3712.31s -> 3713.01s]  I haven't.
[3714.11s -> 3715.31s]  I haven't killed any of them.
[3715.61s -> 3716.61s]  This one is so easy.
[3716.61s -> 3717.01s]  Isn't it?
[3717.71s -> 3719.31s]  Let's get it because it could be something cool.
[3721.95s -> 3723.55s]  Well, you're you're lingering flame.
[3723.55s -> 3724.35s]  You put on the ground.
[3725.15s -> 3726.65s]  You could just like put that in the path.
[3727.15s -> 3728.05s]  That's a good idea.
[3735.87s -> 3740.59s]  Where is it going around you coming down here?
[3748.10s -> 3748.60s]  You missed.
[3749.53s -> 3762.39s]  Oh, it's just like impossible is like one pixel.
[3786.41s -> 3788.61s]  Oh, that's why you do it.
[3789.01s -> 3790.21s]  That's why you do it.
[3790.41s -> 3791.61s]  That's why you do it.
[3792.62s -> 3793.62s]  I just got the black knife.
[3795.29s -> 3796.59s]  I've had that you're lame.
[3796.69s -> 3799.19s]  I got Elden ring the Elden boss remembrance.
[3799.19s -> 3800.79s]  You've got the Elden beast remembrance.
[3801.09s -> 3801.49s]  Yeah.
[3801.59s -> 3803.09s]  Ooh, see it was worth it.
[3803.09s -> 3804.79s]  Now if we didn't do that you what's worth it.
[3804.89s -> 3813.73s]  See you can also jump across the volcano Manor interior from
[3813.73s -> 3816.43s]  the place you get teleported to if you do a running jump.
[3817.13s -> 3817.63s]  Really?
[3822.34s -> 3823.74s]  Let's see what happens when we go this way.
[3825.15s -> 3825.75s]  What's going on?
[3833.49s -> 3834.79s]  I got another smithing stone 7.
[3835.95s -> 3838.35s]  Oh, yeah, I can get big pluses.
[3838.35s -> 3838.95s]  Give it to me.
[3839.05s -> 3840.05s]  Give it to me now.
[3840.55s -> 3841.05s]  Drop it.
[3841.65s -> 3842.65s]  There's no opportunity to do that.
[3842.65s -> 3844.25s]  We're trying to get the map piece.
[3845.15s -> 3845.55s]  You're trying.
[3845.55s -> 3846.95s]  I know what the map looks like already.
[3846.95s -> 3847.75s]  No, you don't.
[3848.25s -> 3850.35s]  I've got fucking IGN calm open.
[3853.95s -> 3854.45s]  I drop it.
[3854.45s -> 3855.95s]  There's there's a boss down here.
[3858.46s -> 3862.88s]  There is it was patched.
[3862.88s -> 3870.04s]  Oh, I should let me wait a minute.
[3872.83s -> 3876.44s]  Hold on this 35,000 souls on the ground.
[3876.44s -> 3878.74s]  I think over here that I yeah, I'll be right back.
[3880.04s -> 3882.04s]  Yeah, that adds up because we killed that boss.
[3882.14s -> 3888.15s]  Yeah, where the fuck is it?
[3888.45s -> 3889.35s]  Is it where I fell?
[3890.62s -> 3892.72s]  It's kind of strange that you left without giving me the
[3892.72s -> 3893.62s]  smithing stone.
[3894.42s -> 3895.02s]  I'll be right back.
[3896.02s -> 3898.32s]  I feel like that's kind of selfish and you're showing
[3898.32s -> 3899.12s]  a side of yourself.
[3899.22s -> 3900.92s]  I didn't know existed and I don't like it.
[3901.22s -> 3902.22s]  We'll fucking deal with it.
[3904.58s -> 3905.28s]  How's that sound?
[3907.91s -> 3909.91s]  Yeah, I'm glad people finally got a glimpse of what you're
[3909.91s -> 3911.91s]  really like during the Christmas stream.
[3912.81s -> 3913.91s]  No, you're being recorded.
[3916.06s -> 3916.86s]  Where are these?
[3917.06s -> 3917.76s]  Where are they?
[3917.76s -> 3920.80s]  Oh, yeah, that would have been awful.
[3920.80s -> 3922.00s]  That's 35,000 souls.
[3922.00s -> 3922.60s]  There's a lot.
[3924.24s -> 3924.84s]  I'll come back.
[3936.46s -> 3939.76s]  I will drop the stone.
[3940.53s -> 3942.53s]  Well, then we have to we got to travel.
[3943.13s -> 3943.83s]  We have to move.
[3945.02s -> 3946.32s]  Into where I can Smith.
[3946.82s -> 3948.53s]  Okay, we can get that.
[3948.53s -> 3950.33s]  I need my smithing.
[3952.10s -> 3952.40s]  Okay.
[3952.90s -> 3957.50s]  Here is the do you have any somber smithing stone?
[3957.60s -> 3958.60s]  Eights by chance.
[3959.70s -> 3963.00s]  I believe I do actually if you like something I recall having
[3963.00s -> 3964.00s]  in my inventory.
[3964.00s -> 3965.50s]  Let me one briefly moment.
[3965.50s -> 3967.80s]  Take a yonder look over into my sombers.
[3967.80s -> 3968.50s]  I have an eight.
[3969.30s -> 3970.40s]  Dude, then here we go.
[3971.40s -> 3972.30s]  This is fucking perfect.
[3972.30s -> 3973.60s]  I discard.
[3976.41s -> 3977.81s]  Wait, which was which one?
[3979.71s -> 3982.11s]  Okay, I'll just you know, we just picked them both up.
[3982.11s -> 3982.51s]  All right.
[3983.35s -> 3984.15s]  I'm putting mine over here.
[3988.09s -> 3990.33s]  Okay, I can go to plus nine now.
[3990.43s -> 3992.03s]  So now we're going to be unstoppable.
[3993.54s -> 3995.44s]  We are going to be genuinely unstoppable.
[3995.44s -> 3998.32s]  Now, let's go Smith.
[4003.70s -> 4016.20s]  Where is there is actually fucking insane true.
[4016.70s -> 4017.40s]  I don't think so.
[4019.71s -> 4021.51s]  Oh, cuz you want to be like the insane guy.
[4021.51s -> 4023.11s]  I'm taking like street cut away from you.
[4024.20s -> 4033.72s]  I was saying to my child, I don't even remember what I was
[4033.72s -> 4036.67s]  saying that you're like, I don't know.
[4036.67s -> 4037.67s]  You're trying to I don't know.
[4037.67s -> 4039.57s]  There's a conspiracy where you're trying to poison me, but
[4039.57s -> 4041.97s]  it backfired because it made me weirder like you want it
[4041.97s -> 4042.67s]  to be weird.
[4043.73s -> 4044.33s]  I don't know.
[4045.65s -> 4046.65s]  Are you talking about?
[4048.55s -> 4051.25s]  There's a conspiracy that I poisoned you.
[4052.28s -> 4055.88s]  Yeah, what's oh explain this conspiracy there that I poisoned
[4055.88s -> 4058.18s]  you last time we played Elden Ring.
[4058.18s -> 4060.62s]  You're like damn stirs like kind of funny.
[4060.62s -> 4062.62s]  Like I feel like I'm losing some cred to him.
[4062.72s -> 4063.52s]  When we're like co-op.
[4063.52s -> 4066.32s]  Oh, I thought you meant like there was a point in the last
[4066.32s -> 4069.02s]  like decade that we've known each other or I just trying
[4069.02s -> 4069.92s]  to poison you.
[4070.12s -> 4070.52s]  Oh, okay.
[4070.52s -> 4071.82s]  No, just last week.
[4072.72s -> 4074.52s]  Yeah, just last week when I hold on a minute.
[4074.52s -> 4076.72s]  I got I'm almost a plus 10 with this thing.
[4077.23s -> 4078.63s]  This thing is beefy now.
[4081.76s -> 4083.96s]  Do you have any of the ancient dragon smithing stones?
[4084.26s -> 4086.56s]  Some of the ones you actually have one of those.
[4086.96s -> 4088.56s]  Yeah, I'm plus 25 on my sword.
[4088.66s -> 4091.06s]  They would give me that somber ancient dragon smithing
[4091.06s -> 4091.36s]  stone.
[4091.36s -> 4092.46s]  I will be plus 10.
[4092.46s -> 4094.46s]  Mine's mine's a hollow here.
[4108.12s -> 4108.82s]  What are you giving me?
[4110.27s -> 4111.27s]  Better not be a staff.
[4123.39s -> 4123.89s]  Hello.
[4128.48s -> 4128.98s]  Thank you.
[4128.98s -> 4131.48s]  Yeah, I treated you would know that has sentimental value.
[4131.58s -> 4135.33s]  It does me strong just traded you his club.
[4136.07s -> 4137.87s]  That's something that that's that's a trinket.
[4137.87s -> 4141.34s]  That's worth isn't isn't a club.
[4142.04s -> 4147.67s]  Just a staff plus 10.
[4147.77s -> 4148.27s]  Let's go.
[4150.68s -> 4152.98s]  I mean, that's something that that holds incredible like
[4152.98s -> 4155.88s]  generational sentimental family value and I just let I just
[4155.88s -> 4156.28s]  gave it to you.
[4158.20s -> 4158.70s]  It's wrong.
[4159.10s -> 4159.60s]  Club.
[4160.53s -> 4162.33s]  Okay, where we're going get back to where we were.
[4162.33s -> 4163.23s]  There's a boss there.
[4165.22s -> 4168.16s]  Yes, I don't remember the name of it.
[4168.16s -> 4171.45s]  It was I was up here.
[4171.45s -> 4176.05s]  It was the ninth Mount Gelmere campsite.
[4177.23s -> 4181.36s]  You sure I think it's the road of let's let's get this
[4181.36s -> 4183.36s]  right because if we can't get in there with the key,
[4183.46s -> 4186.36s]  what is the best way for us to get there because we can't
[4186.36s -> 4188.16s]  go to the manor because it's randomized.
[4188.26s -> 4189.66s]  So we can't open the door.
[4189.66s -> 4192.86s]  So how the fuck do we do this go to Seathwater terminus?
[4193.50s -> 4196.80s]  That's there that has that that has that has to be it.
[4196.80s -> 4197.80s]  And also, I don't know.
[4198.00s -> 4200.50s]  Apparently, we have to go through Ray Lucaria.
[4200.60s -> 4202.10s]  We cannot get there any other way.
[4202.10s -> 4202.60s]  We did that.
[4202.70s -> 4204.30s]  So we should have the way points from down there.
[4204.50s -> 4205.50s]  So we did that.
[4205.50s -> 4207.40s]  So let's get back down there.
[4207.80s -> 4211.00s]  Wherever that is was it subterranean inquisition Chamber
[4211.47s -> 4218.38s]  should be this pre-recorded.
[4219.46s -> 4219.86s]  Why would it?
[4219.86s -> 4223.04s]  Why would it be you managed to stir?
[4223.04s -> 4224.74s]  If I was like, hey dude, like I don't really feel like
[4224.74s -> 4226.84s]  streaming tomorrow, but like let's like scream for like
[4226.84s -> 4228.94s]  seven hours right now, like pretend and then I'll just
[4228.94s -> 4229.74s]  upload it tomorrow.
[4231.14s -> 4235.42s]  I thought about doing that a few times never done it.
[4237.78s -> 4240.15s]  Something about it's funny to me that I could be sitting
[4240.15s -> 4242.25s]  there watching my own stream and like laughing and
[4242.25s -> 4245.88s]  enjoying my stream with everyone else.
[4246.08s -> 4248.58s]  You got a stream on an alt channel of me watching my
[4248.58s -> 4249.98s]  stream reacting to my stream.
[4250.78s -> 4253.98s]  I guess we have to jump from here from the teleport.
[4256.98s -> 4258.58s]  Are you going to do a jungle gym stream?
[4266.78s -> 4267.68s]  Who said hello?
[4267.68s -> 4269.78s]  Oh, I don't people look like that's people.
[4269.78s -> 4271.48s]  Okay, I have no idea who that was.
[4273.04s -> 4274.58s]  Wow, that's a diss.
[4274.58s -> 4275.48s]  You don't know who that was.
[4276.54s -> 4277.04s]  I don't know.
[4278.04s -> 4278.64s]  What do you mean?
[4278.64s -> 4279.24s]  I feel bad.
[4279.54s -> 4281.84s]  Wait, I wasn't even paying attention plate again.
[4282.73s -> 4283.73s]  I can't it's random.
[4285.18s -> 4285.58s]  Hello.
[4287.08s -> 4288.68s]  That was not the same person that just did that.
[4288.78s -> 4289.28s]  Exactly.
[4289.28s -> 4289.98s]  That's what I mean.
[4290.18s -> 4291.08s]  You don't get a redo.
[4294.19s -> 4296.29s]  Okay, so we're not in the right spot.
[4297.09s -> 4299.59s]  I think we have to get to where we get to ported to and
[4299.59s -> 4301.39s]  then jump from where we get ported to.
[4303.95s -> 4305.05s]  Well, that was further up.
[4308.34s -> 4309.24s]  Have you played this before?
[4310.34s -> 4312.54s]  Yeah, but I've like had the key to open the door to the
[4312.54s -> 4315.34s]  manor not jumping from a weird port and breaking all of
[4315.34s -> 4316.04s]  my characters.
[4316.04s -> 4318.64s]  Okay, like legs and then I lose all my souls.
[4318.94s -> 4323.54s]  I haven't played this before and I don't know game is
[4323.64s -> 4326.04s]  like enemy placements are like really weird.
[4326.34s -> 4326.64s]  Okay.
[4326.64s -> 4330.34s]  So where do where's that spot that we are at when we
[4330.34s -> 4331.94s]  teleport here from Ray Lucario?
[4334.13s -> 4336.63s]  That's where we need to go and we need to jump from a
[4336.63s -> 4340.23s]  spot there to get into the manor which is cheating by
[4340.23s -> 4340.63s]  the way.
[4341.03s -> 4342.53s]  Oh, I know what you're talking about.
[4342.83s -> 4344.73s]  I am I am with it.
[4345.03s -> 4345.63s]  So where is it?
[4346.85s -> 4350.80s]  I am we have to actually get eat.
[4350.80s -> 4352.10s]  We have to get eaten again.
[4352.68s -> 4355.38s]  We may have to get eaten again people have keep saying
[4355.38s -> 4357.18s]  patched, but we don't really have very many options.
[4357.18s -> 4360.45s]  Do we why did they patch everything fun in this game?
[4364.39s -> 4368.49s]  Oh true wielding jumping attack and patched so bleed
[4368.89s -> 4369.49s]  patched.
[4369.79s -> 4374.29s]  So if it is patched then can we just not do right card
[4374.29s -> 4377.93s]  and we just have to just keep going ignore them.
[4377.93s -> 4379.23s]  We're going we go again.
[4379.23s -> 4383.13s]  Okay, so we have to go do that Ray Lucario skip again.
[4384.58s -> 4385.18s]  Yeah, sure.
[4385.18s -> 4387.88s]  So that we have to go die down there again, which I'm
[4387.88s -> 4390.28s]  going to lose 22,000 souls by the way.
[4390.28s -> 4391.58s]  23,000 souls.
[4393.13s -> 4393.93s]  No, I'm not.
[4397.86s -> 4399.66s]  I'm going to how much is it to level up?
[4403.95s -> 4404.65s]  You're a baller.
[4404.65s -> 4405.45s]  That's nothing to you.
[4405.55s -> 4406.85s]  I don't want to lose them.
[4410.22s -> 4412.62s]  I have a briefcase full of money.
[4412.62s -> 4414.52s]  I'm not just going to like open it up and dump it on like
[4414.52s -> 4416.32s]  the fucking just side of the road.
[4416.52s -> 4417.52s]  This is like, oh, yeah, dude.
[4417.52s -> 4418.12s]  I'm a baller.
[4418.12s -> 4418.82s]  I don't care.
[4419.12s -> 4421.92s]  Just like yeah, ban out like a million bucks on the fucking
[4421.92s -> 4422.42s]  road.
[4422.92s -> 4425.02s]  I think they're also saying patches gives you something
[4425.42s -> 4428.22s]  but I think that item would be randomized use a twig.
[4430.85s -> 4431.75s]  Oh, I do have those.
[4431.75s -> 4432.45s]  That's a good idea.
[4436.71s -> 4437.71s]  Where are those things?
[4438.80s -> 4440.00s]  Oh, it's a talisman, right?
[4445.67s -> 4446.07s]  Okay.
[4446.37s -> 4447.67s]  I'm ready to do whatever you want to do.
[4447.67s -> 4448.17s]  Let's go.
[4450.34s -> 4451.14s]  Are we in combat?
[4453.23s -> 4455.20s]  No, it says I'm in combat.
[4455.94s -> 4456.74s]  Oh, it does.
[4460.94s -> 4461.94s]  Well, then we're going.
[4461.94s -> 4463.04s]  Are we doing Ray of Lucario?
[4463.04s -> 4475.95s]  We have to do that and then we go to the schoolhouse classroom.
[4475.95s -> 4476.95s]  This is such bullshit.
[4476.95s -> 4480.35s]  Like why didn't they like think to make the game like completely
[4480.35s -> 4482.45s]  accessible to people that are like breaking it and like using
[4482.45s -> 4484.85s]  like fucking mods and cheats on it to ruin the whole thing
[4484.85s -> 4487.15s]  and like randomize everything like they didn't they didn't
[4487.15s -> 4490.05s]  think about that before they made the game is that bug where
[4490.05s -> 4493.85s]  you like block a few times and backstep and teleport across
[4493.85s -> 4495.95s]  the whole map is that still in I don't know.
[4496.66s -> 4499.56s]  It was a speedrun that could beat this game in like two or
[4499.56s -> 4500.76s]  three minutes right because of that.
[4503.99s -> 4505.99s]  I don't know if it was that fast, but they did get pretty
[4505.99s -> 4507.19s]  it was pretty damn fast.
[4507.19s -> 4508.19s]  It was like less than five minutes.
[4508.19s -> 4510.93s]  I think eventually no.
[4510.93s -> 4511.23s]  Yes.
[4511.23s -> 4511.53s]  No.
[4511.53s -> 4512.83s]  Yes, no one.
[4513.13s -> 4517.63s]  I mean if that's still in and we can't jump across a ledge
[4518.72s -> 4519.62s]  and that's all I'm saying.
[4519.62s -> 4520.32s]  That's all I'm saying.
[4520.92s -> 4523.32s]  I got to say somebody I was watching you play Neo for a
[4523.32s -> 4525.82s]  little bit the first time you played it and I already said
[4525.82s -> 4527.92s]  this on my stream, but I have to say it because it was on
[4527.92s -> 4528.72s]  your stream.
[4529.50s -> 4532.00s]  Somebody had an amazing comment on your stream.
[4533.11s -> 4535.11s]  You were trying to learn the game and you haven't like
[4535.11s -> 4538.44s]  trouble and you like all the buttons were so hard to
[4538.44s -> 4540.94s]  remember and just get to getting used to it and somebody
[4540.94s -> 4542.14s]  wrote dude.
[4542.14s -> 4542.84s]  Don't worry.
[4542.84s -> 4544.34s]  Once you get the buttons down.
[4544.34s -> 4547.54s]  You're going to make it rain on this guy like a boss.
[4547.54s -> 4551.04s]  They said like everything that you had said the other day in
[4551.04s -> 4551.94s]  one sentence.
[4551.94s -> 4553.34s]  It was like one paragraph.
[4553.94s -> 4555.04s]  It was I like loved it.
[4555.04s -> 4556.34s]  It was like my favorite comment.
[4557.04s -> 4557.54s]  You don't worry.
[4557.54s -> 4559.94s]  Once you learn the buttons, you're going to make it rain
[4559.94s -> 4563.04s]  on this guy and then like a boss.
[4563.04s -> 4564.64s]  You'll take down the next enemy.
[4564.64s -> 4566.34s]  It was just like perfectly crafted.
[4567.18s -> 4567.58s]  All right.
[4567.58s -> 4568.68s]  That is how it happened.
[4569.72s -> 4570.62s]  So we're going back down.
[4577.12s -> 4577.62s]  Shut up.
[4579.06s -> 4580.56s]  Once I learned the buttons this game.
[4580.56s -> 4581.46s]  I'm going to do it too.
[4585.21s -> 4589.64s]  You coming are you I'm coming down right now.
[4590.14s -> 4591.14s]  I'm coming down right now.
[4591.24s -> 4603.96s]  I was killing the hand just go just going down a lot of
[4603.96s -> 4606.73s]  ladders and elevators today.
[4610.68s -> 4610.98s]  Okay.
[4610.98s -> 4612.68s]  So is it still work?
[4612.68s -> 4613.88s]  We just die down here, right?
[4616.23s -> 4616.53s]  Yep.
[4616.93s -> 4617.53s]  Just die.
[4617.53s -> 4618.03s]  Okay.
[4618.33s -> 4619.33s]  Hey, you pretty good at that.
[4619.43s -> 4619.63s]  Actually.
[4619.63s -> 4619.93s]  Hold on.
[4619.93s -> 4621.03s]  Let me pick up that item.
[4621.03s -> 4621.63s]  I never got.
[4627.67s -> 4633.48s]  Oh, right here.
[4634.08s -> 4634.68s]  Right here.
[4645.29s -> 4645.99s]  This guy sucks.
[4649.23s -> 4650.33s]  Why is it always like this?
[4651.03s -> 4653.23s]  Yeah, these things murder you if you fight them.
[4653.33s -> 4653.63s]  Yeah.
[4653.93s -> 4667.54s]  If you actually play the game fight them minus 26 K.
[4667.64s -> 4668.04s]  Nope.
[4668.24s -> 4669.54s]  I put on the talisman.
[4676.14s -> 4676.54s]  Okay.
[4678.12s -> 4683.58s]  So there's a place we have to jump from here.
[4686.08s -> 4687.28s]  Like over there.
[4689.50s -> 4693.54s]  I remember I remember you spawning in different location
[4693.64s -> 4694.34s]  over here.
[4697.58s -> 4698.58s]  I think it's over here.
[4699.62s -> 4699.92s]  Is it this?
[4699.92s -> 4700.82s]  Yeah, I think it's this way.
[4701.22s -> 4707.91s]  We make this I feel like I would with the horse.
[4708.51s -> 4709.71s]  It's a bit further ahead.
[4711.14s -> 4715.14s]  Oh, no, we're gonna no, no, no, no, we're about to just jump
[4715.14s -> 4715.94s]  off and die.
[4716.14s -> 4717.54s]  I believe I know what they're talking about.
[4717.54s -> 4719.44s]  But I just remembered you spawning in this area in a
[4719.44s -> 4723.83s]  different spot in mod chat.
[4726.40s -> 4728.70s]  Wait, the mod mods playing game form again.
[4729.70s -> 4735.21s]  I mean they had the helping it is over there.
[4737.68s -> 4740.68s]  Yeah, it is that spot and we have to do it from.
[4742.48s -> 4743.08s]  Oh man.
[4743.38s -> 4744.08s]  Okay, hold on.
[4744.58s -> 4750.68s]  We got to do it from like back over here.
[4752.45s -> 4753.45s]  Where's that from?
[4753.45s -> 4754.25s]  Like right here.
[4759.99s -> 4760.79s]  This shit out of the way.
[4761.19s -> 4762.68s]  Wait, what is it?
[4762.68s -> 4763.58s]  It's right here, right?
[4763.98s -> 4764.58s]  Right there.
[4767.03s -> 4767.93s]  It is patched.
[4767.93s -> 4769.23s]  Several people are saying it's patched.
[4769.23s -> 4770.03s]  Wait, that's not it.
[4770.43s -> 4770.83s]  Is that it?
[4770.83s -> 4771.33s]  Yes, it is.
[4772.27s -> 4773.77s]  So it's like right here.
[4778.20s -> 4781.07s]  Fuck my souls.
[4786.55s -> 4787.35s]  That was close.
[4793.31s -> 4794.21s]  Oh, you respawn here.
[4794.41s -> 4795.11s]  Spawn right here.
[4795.11s -> 4796.81s]  I think what about like from here?
[4799.81s -> 4802.63s]  Got it patched.
[4803.23s -> 4803.73s]  Okay, we're good.
[4804.13s -> 4806.63s]  It's that there's a little lip that you have to land on.
[4807.03s -> 4808.43s]  Yeah, it's tricky.
[4809.43s -> 4812.43s]  There's like a little extra a little bit to the right.
[4814.10s -> 4826.77s]  You're a little extra on the top one or the bottom one.
[4827.37s -> 4828.97s]  So do you okay where you are right now?
[4829.47s -> 4832.27s]  You see what that little that rock Juts out just a little like
[4832.27s -> 4833.27s]  a hair extra.
[4833.27s -> 4834.17s]  That's where you want to jump from.
[4840.48s -> 4841.18s]  You're better than me.
[4841.28s -> 4843.48s]  It was not it was I got it in the right spot.
[4843.48s -> 4844.58s]  It's actually really tricky.
[4844.98s -> 4846.18s]  You have to do that thing.
[4846.88s -> 4849.58s]  Like, okay, imagine you're playing Legend of Zelda, you know,
[4849.58s -> 4852.48s]  in Legend of Zelda it jumped for you at the last possible
[4852.48s -> 4853.98s]  frame never played any of them.
[4855.23s -> 4867.76s]  Hold on closer closer.
[4868.16s -> 4869.96s]  Yeah, it's that I've got this next one.
[4869.96s -> 4872.76s]  It's almost you have to step off of the platform.
[4872.76s -> 4876.56s]  Yeah a little and get that last hair that last you got a
[4876.56s -> 4878.06s]  wind walk on the Wind Waker.
[4878.86s -> 4881.36s]  There's an earth tree avatar over here and it's messing.
[4881.36s -> 4881.86s]  Okay.
[4881.86s -> 4882.76s]  I be careful.
[4884.45s -> 4887.44s]  I don't want to have to do this again, dude.
[4887.44s -> 4888.64s]  This is actually really bad.
[4894.89s -> 4895.89s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[4896.19s -> 4897.39s]  Is there a bonfire right here?
[4899.60s -> 4901.60s]  Because if I just get the bonfire, can't you just port
[4901.60s -> 4902.00s]  to it?
[4902.78s -> 4914.89s]  No, no, you can't I hit it.
[4914.89s -> 4918.09s]  That was very very close, but you got to land on this
[4918.09s -> 4919.19s]  like edge.
[4920.19s -> 4922.09s]  I have to I have to land on the other side.
[4924.66s -> 4926.96s]  Oh, I didn't I thought I was going to the lava.
[4927.80s -> 4929.40s]  No, no, you took what?
[4929.40s -> 4930.70s]  What do you see where I'm standing?
[4931.73s -> 4932.03s]  Okay.
[4932.03s -> 4934.43s]  No, now that I know that wait, you thought you were jumping
[4934.43s -> 4935.43s]  into the lava.
[4940.26s -> 4941.36s]  What if I take off your equipment?
[4941.36s -> 4946.26s]  Maybe this this is a I got to tell you this is not even
[4946.26s -> 4946.86s]  the hard part.
[4948.08s -> 4948.58s]  Really?
[4948.58s -> 4952.68s]  No, because we have to get by a like one foot hallway
[4952.68s -> 4954.68s]  where an archery avatar is just sitting there and it's
[4954.68s -> 4955.58s]  like we're going to fall off.
[4966.81s -> 4968.01s]  Maybe they patched it on your game.
[4968.97s -> 4970.07s]  Yeah, because I'm the host.
[4979.00s -> 4979.40s]  Oh, wait.

[4986.66s -> 4987.16s]  Okay.
[4999.33s -> 5001.23s]  Oh, that was it right there.
[5001.23s -> 5003.03s]  I was on it for a second.
[5007.48s -> 5008.88s]  Use his controller.
[5008.88s -> 5011.26s]  I we can't do that bro.
[5011.26s -> 5012.36s]  Can you take the controller?
[5013.83s -> 5014.63s]  I can't do that bro.
[5014.63s -> 5015.33s]  Take it bro.
[5015.33s -> 5017.03s]  All right, just easy.
[5017.03s -> 5017.83s]  Okay, I got it.

[5023.09s -> 5024.29s]  wasn't connected when you did it earlier.
[5024.29s -> 5025.29s]  I wasn't connected though.
[5025.29s -> 5026.59s]  You didn't even jump at all.
[5027.09s -> 5027.89s]  I wasn't even connected.
[5027.89s -> 5028.39s]  Hold on.
[5028.79s -> 5029.49s]  Can you plug me in?
[5030.09s -> 5031.59s]  Yeah, that's Wi-Fi.
[5031.69s -> 5033.09s]  Okay, that's the wireless.
[5043.38s -> 5044.98s]  Something there's something wrong something wrong with
[5044.98s -> 5045.38s]  your controller.
[5045.38s -> 5046.28s]  Okay, give it back.
[5046.28s -> 5046.88s]  Give it back here.
[5046.88s -> 5047.58s]  Just take it back.
[5048.08s -> 5048.88s]  I have a fucking headache now.
[5048.88s -> 5049.38s]  Thanks.
[5049.88s -> 5052.48s]  You control your your your B buttons like sticky.
[5052.48s -> 5053.78s]  I don't know what the fuck you're eating.
[5053.78s -> 5054.68s]  It's different.
[5054.68s -> 5058.15s]  It's different in Neo fucking headache.
[5058.15s -> 5066.67s]  No, I fucking hate it.
[5070.17s -> 5072.27s]  We're going to be here all day VOD viewers.
[5073.34s -> 5074.34s]  You can't skip.
[5077.61s -> 5081.31s]  Yeah, dude, you should disable disable timeline skipping
[5081.31s -> 5081.91s]  on this VOD.
[5082.41s -> 5090.05s]  Oh, you have to do it at a 30 FPS because if you jump in
[5090.05s -> 5094.96s]  Dark Souls at a high frame rate, it doesn't work magic.
[5094.96s -> 5095.66s]  You could do that.
[5096.53s -> 5097.73s]  That's that's a real Dark Souls.
[5097.73s -> 5098.23s]  No, no, no.
[5098.23s -> 5101.33s]  I mean like make it so people cannot like skip through
[5101.33s -> 5102.43s]  your VODs timeline.
[5103.88s -> 5104.98s]  Now you have to watch.
[5105.58s -> 5106.18s]  Sorry.
[5107.48s -> 5109.58s]  You have to sit here for this like 20 minutes.
[5110.26s -> 5110.76s]  I got it.
[5111.87s -> 5112.57s]  Are you serious?
[5112.57s -> 5113.27s]  That's very close.
[5114.07s -> 5117.93s]  Do you see where you okay to on your left?
[5117.93s -> 5120.13s]  It is a piece that juts out a little bit further.
[5120.23s -> 5122.23s]  You want to land on that like little piece that's jutted
[5122.23s -> 5123.03s]  out a little further.
[5123.03s -> 5124.93s]  It's like very very nuanced.
[5126.34s -> 5127.64s]  Yeah, you got to go a little more to the left.
[5128.43s -> 5131.63s]  This one's for all the fucking Wolf Boys in chat.
[5132.39s -> 5132.89s]  Okay.
[5132.89s -> 5133.39s]  All right.
[5135.57s -> 5138.92s]  Don't seem to care about them really at all after that.
[5148.01s -> 5150.51s]  This one goes out to all my scaly brethren.
[5150.71s -> 5151.31s]  Okay.
[5157.24s -> 5160.23s]  I missed I'm getting worse.
[5162.15s -> 5162.35s]  All right.
[5162.35s -> 5164.25s]  I'm going to stand where you should be.
[5164.35s -> 5165.95s]  I have so many debuffs.
[5165.95s -> 5168.35s]  I'm concerned that even if I make it I will die because
[5168.35s -> 5169.85s]  I have like no health.
[5170.85s -> 5171.95s]  Whoa, okay.
[5171.95s -> 5172.25s]  Never.
[5172.25s -> 5172.65s]  I don't care.
[5172.65s -> 5173.15s]  Just do it.
[5173.45s -> 5174.15s]  I was going to stand.
[5174.15s -> 5176.62s]  Okay, you need to land like here.
[5177.71s -> 5178.61s]  Okay, I'm aiming.
[5178.61s -> 5179.91s]  Okay, no stay there.
[5179.91s -> 5182.31s]  No, because you're not going to be able to land on it.
[5185.68s -> 5186.28s]  I think that's it.
[5193.25s -> 5196.35s]  Wow, you guys really stand on it.
[5196.35s -> 5197.25s]  This is kind of embarrassing.
[5197.25s -> 5198.65s]  He really must hate those skillies.
[5198.65s -> 5201.25s]  Oh, I don't yeah, I don't he's fucking take a while.
[5201.85s -> 5202.45s]  That's all right.
[5202.45s -> 5203.55s]  I'll be here when you guys are ready.
[5210.09s -> 5212.76s]  Hey, big fan of you two.
[5213.26s -> 5213.96s]  Can I get in here?
[5213.96s -> 5215.66s]  I'll switch friend code by any chance.
[5215.76s -> 5217.26s]  Is this your lizard voice?
[5217.26s -> 5218.56s]  Are you mocking lizards?
[5218.56s -> 5219.66s]  No, it's all good man.
[5219.96s -> 5221.16s]  Well, no, it's good.
[5221.84s -> 5222.44s]  Keep trying.
[5224.82s -> 5227.12s]  No, me and the urge ray avatar are hanging out and having
[5227.12s -> 5227.92s]  a conversation.
[5228.42s -> 5235.73s]  Hey see your way out of it next one.
[5235.73s -> 5237.13s]  I have it next one.
[5238.54s -> 5239.94s]  I have it 100%.
[5240.04s -> 5242.84s]  I feel like I just connected the dots.
[5243.68s -> 5247.01s]  You're going to come down there and help could you maybe
[5247.01s -> 5248.31s]  you could I'm just kidding.
[5248.31s -> 5249.01s]  I'm gonna kill you.
[5251.88s -> 5252.78s]  God damn it guys.
[5252.78s -> 5253.38s]  He's so bored.
[5253.38s -> 5254.28s]  He's doing fits.
[5254.38s -> 5255.88s]  I'm fucking up everything.
[5257.24s -> 5259.24s]  I was pretty like aggro him down here.
[5261.28s -> 5262.28s]  Oh, you made it.
[5262.98s -> 5263.18s]  All right.
[5263.18s -> 5264.38s]  Good luck because now this is the hard part.
[5266.12s -> 5267.82s]  I actually have so many debuffs.
[5267.82s -> 5268.52s]  I have no health.
[5269.48s -> 5271.68s]  You are guaranteed to die.
[5271.98s -> 5273.18s]  I'm just telling you right now.
[5273.38s -> 5274.28s]  Don't be upset.
[5274.48s -> 5276.48s]  Hope you got that down because there's no way you're getting
[5276.48s -> 5276.98s]  by this.
[5279.74s -> 5280.64s]  What did you just do?
[5281.04s -> 5281.84s]  I use the rune arc.
[5281.84s -> 5282.44s]  It didn't do anything.
[5282.44s -> 5282.84s]  All right.
[5282.84s -> 5283.44s]  We have to go.
[5284.51s -> 5285.71s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[5285.71s -> 5286.71s]  back up, back up, back up, back up.
[5286.71s -> 5287.71s]  Where are we going?
[5287.91s -> 5289.11s]  Where's the correct path from here?
[5289.61s -> 5291.31s]  We can get on the rooftop to the left.
[5291.31s -> 5293.81s]  I don't like where are we go to the left or up?
[5297.71s -> 5302.17s]  Where's the way to get a bonfire quick left?
[5306.55s -> 5308.35s]  It's one for all the Wolfman out there.
[5314.05s -> 5314.45s]  That's okay.
[5314.45s -> 5315.65s]  You got this jump first try.
[5323.62s -> 5325.92s]  They were just like bugs in my clothing.
[5328.16s -> 5329.46s]  There was so many bugs.
[5332.63s -> 5334.13s]  Fucking God damn it.
[5334.23s -> 5336.23s]  Now we're going to sit here for like another 10 minutes while
[5336.23s -> 5337.13s]  I do this.
[5337.53s -> 5339.03s]  I did it first try.
[5341.59s -> 5349.70s]  Dude, my stamina bar is like the size of my right here.
[5350.30s -> 5351.30s]  It's like right there.
[5354.53s -> 5356.43s]  I have to get it in less and I have to get in less than five
[5356.43s -> 5358.93s]  tries so I can prove that I am better than you at this.
[5359.53s -> 5364.00s]  Okay, there was no doubt about it.
[5364.98s -> 5366.78s]  But I think also you left your souls.
[5370.04s -> 5370.94s]  I'm so angry at you.
[5370.94s -> 5371.64s]  This is your fault.
[5374.53s -> 5375.83s]  This is your fault that that happened.
[5375.93s -> 5376.53s]  I didn't in three tries.
[5376.53s -> 5377.03s]  I'm better than you.
[5377.63s -> 5378.23s]  Let's go left.
[5378.33s -> 5378.73s]  Okay.
[5378.93s -> 5382.03s]  Well, I'm going to jump off again to prove that I can do it
[5382.03s -> 5382.53s]  in three.
[5387.07s -> 5388.17s]  Wait, no, you don't do that.
[5388.85s -> 5389.25s]  All right.
[5389.25s -> 5390.65s]  I have no idea what we're doing here.
[5390.65s -> 5397.21s]  We need to be careful because the firing lasers over here.
[5399.30s -> 5399.70s]  What's that?
[5400.80s -> 5403.00s]  This way we jump from here.
[5406.66s -> 5406.96s]  Okay.
[5406.96s -> 5408.36s]  I guess we're all right.
[5415.16s -> 5415.76s]  Don't die.
[5422.07s -> 5424.77s]  We're in we just have to find the right bonfire.
[5434.22s -> 5436.12s]  Why am I mad that I killed the pot?
[5436.22s -> 5437.52s]  Oh, it's all right.
[5443.54s -> 5444.44s]  Oh, there's a dog.
[5444.64s -> 5445.44s]  There's a dog.
[5446.14s -> 5447.74s]  You don't want to get the item over here.
[5448.54s -> 5450.04s]  I jumped across a weird way.
[5450.34s -> 5451.74s]  There's dogs growling on me.
[5451.74s -> 5453.44s]  Oh God, he gonna get me.
[5453.84s -> 5454.24s]  No, no, no.
[5454.24s -> 5457.42s]  I'm good.
[5458.40s -> 5459.40s]  I can't lock onto him.
[5459.90s -> 5460.50s]  Just I'm right here.
[5460.50s -> 5460.90s]  I'm right here.
[5461.20s -> 5462.00s]  Just focus.
[5463.94s -> 5464.34s]  Got him.
[5469.05s -> 5470.85s]  I do no damage because all my curses.
[5474.38s -> 5477.23s]  Okay, we don't go up.
[5479.12s -> 5480.12s]  I thought you did that.
[5481.64s -> 5482.64s]  Oh, no.
[5483.44s -> 5484.34s]  Oh, no.
[5484.44s -> 5485.24s]  What are you doing?
[5486.24s -> 5487.24s]  What are you doing?
[5488.44s -> 5490.64s]  Shoot a fucking beam at him or something, dude.
[5490.64s -> 5491.34s]  What the hell?
[5491.94s -> 5493.04s]  I don't do any damage.
[5493.04s -> 5493.94s]  I'm out of magic.
[5493.94s -> 5496.04s]  My magic bar is like a centimeter.
[5496.04s -> 5496.44s]  All right.
[5496.54s -> 5498.24s]  We how we can't get up there.
[5501.42s -> 5506.68s]  No, not one more fucking Craig.
[5507.55s -> 5507.95s]  All right.
[5516.75s -> 5517.55s]  There's an elevator.
[5517.55s -> 5520.45s]  We tell you we want to take an elevator up currently.
[5527.71s -> 5529.41s]  I know there's an item over there, but I'm telling you it's not
[5529.41s -> 5529.81s]  worth it.
[5532.06s -> 5532.96s]  We need an elevator.
[5533.56s -> 5535.06s]  Elevator is across the lava.
[5536.34s -> 5542.17s]  I think over here this way.
[5543.97s -> 5544.57s]  We have to go.
[5544.57s -> 5545.27s]  Where do we go?
[5548.45s -> 5549.35s]  Oh shit.
[5550.22s -> 5551.32s]  Go on the rooftops.
[5553.19s -> 5553.69s]  I'm dead.
[5553.99s -> 5554.59s]  Oh, no.
[5556.20s -> 5557.00s]  Oh, no.
[5558.38s -> 5568.97s]  Go left then elevator up the lava just slows you mostly.
[5568.97s -> 5571.67s]  If you have to quickstep you can make it walk on the lava, please.
[5571.97s -> 5582.02s]  I can't I don't I don't have enough health if we have to walk
[5582.02s -> 5582.82s]  across the lava.
[5583.72s -> 5588.22s]  You actually don't I seriously have like a centimeter of a health
[5588.22s -> 5588.52s]  bar.
[5588.52s -> 5589.42s]  So all right.
[5589.82s -> 5594.12s]  So you talk about like down here walk like in that way a walk
[5594.12s -> 5597.62s]  like down this way down like there.
[5597.82s -> 5611.64s]  You mean right left need to hide here because I cast this bullshit.
[5619.62s -> 5621.42s]  You're going to have no health bar.
[5623.35s -> 5624.45s]  I think we should leave.
[5625.35s -> 5627.35s]  Yeah, but we like we're so close.
[5627.35s -> 5629.85s]  So what about like you come up this way like over there?
[5630.45s -> 5634.52s]  Well, can you just do it and then get a vote to teleport like
[5634.52s -> 5634.92s]  this?
[5637.72s -> 5640.42s]  Yeah, I think you jump in between that area and then you turn
[5640.42s -> 5649.88s]  you go right not well, we're going for it now not like this.
[5650.68s -> 5651.48s]  Yeah, flash.
[5651.48s -> 5652.78s]  I think you can still make it.
[5659.64s -> 5660.64s]  I think you missed it.
[5660.64s -> 5664.94s]  Where where where you got to go back around around this octagon
[5666.04s -> 5670.04s]  into the hole into the gap to the right in here to the right
[5670.44s -> 5687.08s]  right now where oh now what all right.
[5687.08s -> 5688.18s]  Oh my god, just don't die.
[5688.78s -> 5689.88s]  Where's the bonfire from here?
[5689.98s -> 5692.28s]  I forget it's like I told you the wrong way.
[5692.58s -> 5692.98s]  It's okay.
[5693.58s -> 5694.48s]  That's like a joke.
[5700.70s -> 5702.70s]  Oh, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup.
[5702.70s -> 5703.80s]  Then there's the thing you go up.
[5705.74s -> 5706.94s]  She says you died.
[5707.44s -> 5707.64s]  All right.
[5707.64s -> 5709.14s]  Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup,
[5709.14s -> 5710.44s]  yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup.
[5711.57s -> 5713.07s]  Is anyone's cat like looking?
[5713.57s -> 5714.27s]  Yup, yup, yup, yup.
[5714.27s -> 5714.97s]  Is that like a cat?
[5714.97s -> 5715.47s]  I don't know.
[5715.57s -> 5716.67s]  You just make weird noises.
[5717.37s -> 5720.17s]  That's not a typical like come here cat noise.
[5720.97s -> 5725.77s]  So I noticed that my wife Ashley she always talks to her dog
[5726.27s -> 5728.47s]  exactly the same way as the rest of her family.
[5728.47s -> 5730.57s]  They like, you know, there's like a dog speak where you like
[5730.57s -> 5731.47s]  change your tone of voice.
[5732.17s -> 5733.17s]  You know, yes.
[5733.57s -> 5736.27s]  So I was like you like exactly like your sister exactly like
[5736.27s -> 5737.67s]  you all talk to your dog the same way.
[5737.67s -> 5738.87s]  I was like, that's kind of weird.
[5738.87s -> 5739.97s]  And she was like, oh, that's not weird.
[5739.97s -> 5741.07s]  That's just like we're a family.
[5741.74s -> 5743.44s]  So I was like, oh, well, you there's like plenty of ways
[5743.44s -> 5744.74s]  you could talk to your dog.
[5744.74s -> 5746.14s]  And let me give you an example.
[5746.54s -> 5749.54s]  Our dog's name is mouse and I just got really weird and slowly
[5749.54s -> 5754.77s]  started hovering down to it going a mouse cute dog.
[5754.77s -> 5758.77s]  And she got so fucking scared and like was panicking to get
[5758.77s -> 5759.37s]  away from me.
[5760.53s -> 5761.33s]  What the fuck?
[5763.40s -> 5765.10s]  Yeah, I don't.
[5768.78s -> 5771.88s]  Apparently you need the fucking like psycho.
[5773.48s -> 5776.68s]  You need to like do we like anime or whatever voice?
[5780.42s -> 5782.32s]  Yeah, how's that anime voice?
[5785.60s -> 5786.40s]  It's I don't know.
[5786.90s -> 5789.90s]  Everything is like a little like a few pitches higher.
[5790.40s -> 5793.10s]  I would say that's more Muppets than anime.
[5793.30s -> 5795.30s]  That's more like Sesame Street than anime.
[5796.88s -> 5797.98s]  Do you like sesame seeds?
[5798.78s -> 5799.08s]  Yeah.
[5799.88s -> 5800.18s]  All right.
[5800.18s -> 5802.28s]  They don't have any flavor and they get stuck in your teeth.
[5803.18s -> 5803.88s]  The bridge is up.
[5804.18s -> 5805.68s]  So that is complete.
[5805.78s -> 5808.08s]  Now we just go this way and I think we can open up this back
[5808.58s -> 5809.38s]  door here, right?
[5820.05s -> 5821.25s]  And then this is here.
[5822.60s -> 5823.90s]  It doesn't open from this side.
[5825.16s -> 5827.10s]  It's okay.
[5831.17s -> 5832.47s]  This whole thing was for nothing.
[5835.49s -> 5837.39s]  We have to beat this boss in here.
[5842.96s -> 5844.56s]  Find a different bonfire.
[5844.56s -> 5845.16s]  Okay.
[5846.56s -> 5849.96s]  All right, please pray to the randomizer gods.
[5850.36s -> 5856.06s]  That you just keep dying that in here is like mad soldier 2.
[5856.64s -> 5857.44s]  I'm almost there.
[5859.10s -> 5860.70s]  Can I like peek in here and see who it is?
[5861.20s -> 5862.20s]  Oh, is that the boss?
[5862.20s -> 5864.10s]  Oh, yeah, and they would glitch that door.
[5864.60s -> 5865.10s]  See the bro.
[5865.10s -> 5866.10s]  It's bad soldier.
[5866.10s -> 5867.30s]  I think it's mad soldier 2.
[5868.88s -> 5869.58s]  This is huge.
[5869.58s -> 5870.98s]  I think that's just a shitty enemy.
[5870.98s -> 5871.48s]  Isn't it?
[5874.58s -> 5875.78s]  I think that's a mad soldier 2.
[5875.78s -> 5878.27s]  I think wait a minute.
[5878.27s -> 5878.87s]  No, it's not.
[5882.23s -> 5882.83s]  Who is that?
[5883.03s -> 5883.83s]  Do I have binoculars?
[5886.62s -> 5887.82s]  No, I don't want to die.
[5888.65s -> 5889.85s]  Got to do it eventually.
[5892.12s -> 5893.32s]  Everybody dies once.
[5894.12s -> 5901.62s]  Is it blade from Mortal Kombat?
[5903.64s -> 5904.14s]  All right.
[5904.24s -> 5909.20s]  So but I think there's a just go go go.
[5909.20s -> 5910.00s]  Is it Gideon?
[5910.00s -> 5912.96s]  I'm just going who is it?
[5916.29s -> 5916.89s]  It's blade.
[5916.89s -> 5921.26s]  I think it's millennia.
[5921.76s -> 5925.86s]  It runs over did the runs over the runs over the runs over.
[5925.86s -> 5927.26s]  What the fuck we're not going to do.
[5927.26s -> 5927.76s]  I'm not going to wait.
[5927.76s -> 5928.76s]  There's no it's impossible.
[5931.84s -> 5935.86s]  It's you got to be not going to have a face to you got it.
[5935.86s -> 5936.16s]  Wait.
[5936.46s -> 5937.06s]  Yes, she is.
[5938.58s -> 5938.78s]  Wait.
[5938.78s -> 5944.39s]  Yeah, she is that half health as long as you're good at the game.
[5944.39s -> 5944.99s]  You can win.
[5945.39s -> 5951.29s]  I haven't played against millennia in a long ass time and I have a lot
[5967.59s -> 5978.55s]  flawless just watch out for when she swings the sword.
[5983.42s -> 5986.92s]  A lot of people thought millennia don't know the sword hurts swords
[5986.92s -> 5987.52s]  where the damage comes.
[5987.52s -> 5988.92s]  I have like no stamina.
[6021.00s -> 6021.90s]  It was the sword.
[6022.74s -> 6026.44s]  It's the fact that it's the fact that I have fucking like half of my
[6026.44s -> 6032.94s]  HP and half of my stamina bar and it's millennia and I hate this motherfucker.
[6036.58s -> 6036.68s]  Yeah.
[6036.68s -> 6042.38s]  Well, I can't take one take of lava damage and I'm back here.
[6044.20s -> 6045.00s]  I'm in hell.
[6047.20s -> 6047.40s]  Okay.
[6047.40s -> 6048.00s]  So here's the plan.
[6050.44s -> 6051.44s]  I can't believe millennia.
[6051.44s -> 6053.24s]  I really hope there's no face to all right.
[6053.24s -> 6054.04s]  So here's what we're going to do.
[6054.74s -> 6056.04s]  Follow me ready.
[6057.42s -> 6058.62s]  I can't take any.
[6058.82s -> 6060.52s]  All right, but me raising the bridge.
[6060.62s -> 6061.32s]  Jerma Jerma.
[6061.32s -> 6061.82s]  Look at this.
[6066.74s -> 6067.94s]  Okay, we have to leave.
[6068.24s -> 6069.34s]  We have to leave.
[6069.44s -> 6070.54s]  We can't stay here.
[6070.74s -> 6072.74s]  We have to we have to leave.
[6076.08s -> 6077.58s]  Does anybody have a solution?
[6080.40s -> 6083.00s]  You can get to it from the rooftops.
[6084.74s -> 6085.24s]  Okay.
[6085.74s -> 6095.26s]  Let's see if I can fuck did why why are we here?
[6095.96s -> 6096.96s]  Just to suffer.
[6097.36s -> 6100.06s]  I think I should we just go to the Altus Plateau.
[6101.54s -> 6104.78s]  There's so many different things we could do go through the caves.
[6106.10s -> 6107.90s]  There's a bonfire over there you bozo.
[6108.70s -> 6111.90s]  I mean, it's I don't remember where all this stuff is.
[6112.74s -> 6114.54s]  Is a grace in the town.
[6115.04s -> 6116.44s]  I'm going to I'm going to save us.
[6116.44s -> 6117.64s]  Okay, I promise.
[6117.64s -> 6118.44s]  I'm going to rescue us.
[6120.47s -> 6122.97s]  You know what you should just sit down at a bonfire.
[6123.57s -> 6124.37s]  I just didn't okay.
[6124.37s -> 6125.07s]  I'm going to save us.
[6125.17s -> 6125.77s]  I'm going to save us.
[6125.87s -> 6126.97s]  It's going to be all up to me.
[6143.58s -> 6144.98s]  Your health bar is going to look like mine.
[6145.48s -> 6146.68s]  It's not great already.
[6163.55s -> 6163.85s]  All right.
[6164.05s -> 6167.45s]  Nice and watch this the ledge master.
[6175.21s -> 6176.61s]  There's a gargoyle following you.
[6177.01s -> 6179.61s]  But oh fuck you guy.
[6180.21s -> 6183.41s]  He he that was very impressive.
[6184.31s -> 6188.08s]  I don't know why he's still here.
[6193.31s -> 6193.71s]  Okay.
[6193.81s -> 6194.01s]  All right.
[6194.01s -> 6194.31s]  All right.
[6194.31s -> 6195.61s]  I'm going to find us a bonfire.
[6197.22s -> 6200.32s]  Ah, stop calm down.
[6208.90s -> 6211.10s]  Okay in on this.
[6211.10s -> 6215.38s]  I think this one in this town somewhere hanging out like in here.
[6219.07s -> 6220.47s]  You're right up the ladder.
[6222.14s -> 6222.74s]  Hold on.
[6222.94s -> 6224.14s]  Let me just be smart about this.
[6224.14s -> 6224.84s]  Are you watching?
[6225.54s -> 6226.84s]  I'm the best I can.
[6231.76s -> 6233.06s]  I'm so nervous.
[6234.06s -> 6244.77s]  I don't know what that was, but it was big whatever it was.
[6245.88s -> 6252.29s]  It was a huge where it looks like the Great Wolf from the classroom.
[6252.99s -> 6253.49s]  Okay.
[6253.49s -> 6255.99s]  Well, this ladder is the ladder somewhere right here somewhere.
[6255.99s -> 6256.49s]  Where's the ladder?
[6256.49s -> 6257.09s]  I don't see it.
[6257.09s -> 6257.99s]  I'm looking for a ladder.
[6260.12s -> 6260.72s]  Fuck.
[6261.32s -> 6262.12s]  Where's this ladder?
[6262.82s -> 6263.22s]  Help me.
[6263.22s -> 6270.05s]  Somebody help where it was right there.
[6270.15s -> 6271.25s]  I don't know.
[6271.25s -> 6272.15s]  I don't know where it is.
[6273.21s -> 6273.51s]  Dude.
[6273.51s -> 6277.02s]  I where is this a ladder?
[6277.02s -> 6278.92s]  Where is this fucking ladder?
[6283.19s -> 6284.89s]  It's next to the gunpowder enemy.
[6284.89s -> 6285.59s]  You're just panicking.
[6285.59s -> 6287.09s]  That's a giant dog.
[6289.68s -> 6290.18s]  I got us.
[6290.18s -> 6290.68s]  I got us somewhere.
[6290.68s -> 6291.38s]  I'm going to rescue us.
[6291.38s -> 6291.98s]  Just relax.
[6297.34s -> 6297.74s]  All right.
[6298.51s -> 6300.11s]  Where is this fucking ladder?
[6300.31s -> 6301.71s]  I'm so mad at this game.
[6302.61s -> 6303.51s]  I'm so mad at this game.
[6304.01s -> 6304.71s]  I hate this game.
[6311.32s -> 6313.12s]  Don't you fucking kidding me?
[6318.99s -> 6320.69s]  Yeah, Neo 2 has to as a co-op.
[6325.81s -> 6327.81s]  Why is that dog down there?
[6328.51s -> 6329.71s]  It's not fair.
[6332.64s -> 6335.74s]  What would the developers thinking putting that there?
[6339.88s -> 6341.18s]  What a dog in the lava?
[6349.28s -> 6350.78s]  Dude, I actually don't have health.
[6352.08s -> 6352.88s]  If I all right.
[6353.68s -> 6356.78s]  It's one tick and get I'm getting some conflicted info that even
[6356.78s -> 6360.18s]  if I use the ladder the doors locked that I'm going to get to that
[6360.18s -> 6360.68s]  correct.
[6360.78s -> 6363.68s]  Am I being trolled right now by 600 million people?
[6368.30s -> 6370.70s]  I pressed it but that is correct.
[6370.80s -> 6371.10s]  Okay.
[6371.70s -> 6375.79s]  I don't think we can physically do this area unless we kill
[6375.79s -> 6376.29s]  millennia.
[6377.58s -> 6383.80s]  I believe that's true because I know even speedruns would kill
[6383.80s -> 6386.70s]  that boss and they want to not fight that boss.
[6388.38s -> 6392.37s]  So if there were a way around it, they'd probably do it.
[6393.53s -> 6397.03s]  Okay, this time I'm going to wait for you to do nowadays.
[6397.43s -> 6401.13s]  We just like like can we even warp out and just get some hit
[6401.13s -> 6401.63s]  points?
[6402.61s -> 6403.91s]  I'm going to try this one more shot here.
[6404.61s -> 6407.21s]  I was so excited to play Elden Ring today.
[6408.51s -> 6409.11s]  We're okay.
[6410.54s -> 6412.64s]  I'm taking so much more damage for tick.
[6424.14s -> 6424.64s]  Okay.
[6425.57s -> 6429.17s]  So before I run in here, there's a ladder on the right.
[6429.37s -> 6431.37s]  You don't even fuck you.
[6431.57s -> 6433.57s]  You came over here because you knew I was going to be here.
[6433.57s -> 6434.97s]  Now you sit there looking at me.
[6435.17s -> 6435.87s]  That's bullshit.
[6435.87s -> 6436.57s]  Do you know it?
[6441.63s -> 6442.93s]  It's up the road.
[6448.12s -> 6450.78s]  I am up the road.
[6450.78s -> 6454.42s]  You see look at the clip that doesn't do anything and just
[6454.42s -> 6456.92s]  waits for the protagonist to come back to like initiate a
[6456.92s -> 6457.82s]  new conversation.
[6458.60s -> 6458.90s]  It's okay.
[6458.90s -> 6459.30s]  Hold on.
[6460.55s -> 6462.15s]  Yeah, it looks like the great wall.
[6462.55s -> 6462.95s]  Okay.
[6462.95s -> 6463.85s]  Yeah, I see it.
[6463.85s -> 6464.95s]  But okay, hold on.
[6464.95s -> 6465.55s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[6468.26s -> 6470.66s]  It's behind the big gargoyle thing.
[6470.96s -> 6471.36s]  Okay.
[6479.59s -> 6480.09s]  I know where it is.
[6480.09s -> 6482.69s]  No, but can I even get there without getting attacked?
[6483.62s -> 6490.88s]  Oh my God.
[6507.07s -> 6508.47s]  Please don't kill me.
[6518.50s -> 6521.80s]  This is kind of fucking impossible when that dog is there
[6521.90s -> 6523.40s]  and so much shit.
[6524.90s -> 6525.30s]  Okay.
[6526.00s -> 6526.40s]  Okay.
[6527.84s -> 6530.24s]  I banished you which clears the debuffs.
[6531.59s -> 6532.49s]  Oh, that's smart.
[6532.99s -> 6535.19s]  So we can like, I don't know if you want to we can try on
[6535.19s -> 6535.89s]  our own.
[6536.29s -> 6538.99s]  If one of us gets to the Millennia we can fight Millennia.
[6539.39s -> 6540.99s]  Oh, that's actually wait.
[6540.99s -> 6541.99s]  What did I just get ported to?
[6546.06s -> 6546.66s]  Why am I here?
[6554.82s -> 6558.52s]  We have to get killed at the karya gate again.
[6560.32s -> 6561.02s]  Oh you do.
[6561.02s -> 6562.22s]  I first tried the jump.
[6562.22s -> 6562.82s]  I'm going.
[6564.76s -> 6564.96s]  All right.
[6564.96s -> 6566.76s]  Well, let's see if you can get there in the meantime.
[6566.76s -> 6567.76s]  I'm going to relax.
[6575.48s -> 6575.98s]  I hear that.
[6575.98s -> 6576.78s]  There's a dog.
[6579.24s -> 6581.24s]  There is and it's awful.
[6589.93s -> 6591.43s]  You don't need to you can just go to the place.
[6592.83s -> 6594.63s]  We cannot get the key.
[6594.83s -> 6595.83s]  None of the doors open.
[6597.20s -> 6599.80s]  This entire zone is closed off.
[6599.80s -> 6603.08s]  I think we have to kill Millennia.
[6603.28s -> 6603.98s]  One of us does.
[6608.99s -> 6610.59s]  You can skip Millennia, but it's hard.
[6613.42s -> 6615.52s]  But your drink sounds like a Minecraft skeleton.
[6625.52s -> 6627.22s]  Go through Volcano Manor normally.
[6628.26s -> 6630.16s]  I that's not possible.
[6634.29s -> 6650.96s]  I don't know where I am up the ladder.
[6650.96s -> 6652.16s]  On the normal exit.
[6652.16s -> 6653.06s]  I'm going to set up the ladder.
[6653.06s -> 6655.86s]  You can jump to the right onto a ledge and then open the door
[6655.86s -> 6657.06s]  from the inside.
[6665.41s -> 6665.81s]  Okay.
[6665.81s -> 6666.91s]  Let me see if I can do this.
[6672.12s -> 6675.82s]  I am I'm cooking.
[6676.93s -> 6677.43s]  I'm cooking.
[6677.43s -> 6677.83s]  I'm cooking.
[6677.83s -> 6678.63s]  Did you get the ladder?
[6679.03s -> 6681.13s]  I found I went all the way around a bloodhound steps.
[6681.13s -> 6683.93s]  I just dashed the lava like way way away to the back and I
[6683.93s -> 6684.83s]  found one of the elevators.
[6685.23s -> 6685.53s]  Okay.
[6686.13s -> 6687.43s]  Do you have a bonfire?
[6688.13s -> 6690.63s]  I got hit out of the elevator by the one enemy that's in this
[6690.63s -> 6691.03s]  area.
[6692.03s -> 6692.93s]  So you didn't make it.
[6693.43s -> 6696.43s]  I'm I'm currently in the process of making it.
[6697.03s -> 6697.33s]  Okay.
[6697.33s -> 6699.03s]  Well, just you focus don't even talk to me.
[6699.03s -> 6699.53s]  Just do it.
[6714.31s -> 6714.81s]  I made it.
[6715.11s -> 6716.11s]  I know where I am.
[6716.41s -> 6718.81s]  Okay, so you made it up the ladder and you made it up to
[6718.81s -> 6720.01s]  the place we need where we need to be.
[6722.01s -> 6723.71s]  Yes, join me.
[6724.31s -> 6726.51s]  I don't appreciate you making fun of me.
[6730.45s -> 6731.15s]  Say less.
[6731.15s -> 6732.55s]  Oh, it gave me all the debuffs again.
[6732.55s -> 6733.75s]  Once I opened up my world.
[6734.72s -> 6737.32s]  It did it did so maybe I should close it.
[6737.32s -> 6738.22s]  Oh, wait a minute.
[6738.22s -> 6738.72s]  Hold on.
[6741.36s -> 6744.36s]  I'm just going to try and find a bonfire find a bonfire.
[6744.36s -> 6745.56s]  That's the most important thing.
[6748.87s -> 6750.77s]  All these motherfuckers just waiting for me.
[6750.87s -> 6751.37s]  Whatever.
[6763.32s -> 6768.28s]  I was gonna wait for you to do it and then I go up this
[6768.28s -> 6774.58s]  elevator the dog.
[6775.08s -> 6778.68s]  Just wait, you know, I'm gonna just lose the dog is going
[6778.68s -> 6779.28s]  to kill you.
[6780.34s -> 6781.54s]  I went a different way.
[6783.51s -> 6784.41s]  I skipped the dog.
[6784.41s -> 6785.41s]  I did dog skip.
[6785.61s -> 6786.81s]  Oh you did dog really?
[6787.94s -> 6789.54s]  I'm at the gate to Millennia.
[6789.54s -> 6793.18s]  Okay, so just be on the lookout for a bonfire and just
[6793.18s -> 6794.38s]  sit on it when you get there.
[6795.70s -> 6797.20s]  Can you still do the bridge jump?
[6808.29s -> 6811.79s]  I said you can but it's really really hard bridge jump
[6811.79s -> 6812.79s]  is not as hard.
[6814.09s -> 6816.39s]  I remember when they patched it and then I also remember
[6816.39s -> 6817.89s]  people still doing it the same day.
[6820.86s -> 6822.36s]  But it did look very hard.
[6823.52s -> 6825.82s]  How did you do dog skip and you didn't climb up the
[6825.82s -> 6826.12s]  ladder?
[6826.12s -> 6829.12s]  I went all the way to left through the lava.
[6829.12s -> 6831.62s]  I bloodhound steps through all the lava didn't go through
[6831.62s -> 6832.22s]  the town.
[6835.82s -> 6837.22s]  I was gonna kill all these motherfuckers.
[6837.22s -> 6842.54s]  I'm gonna kill the dog come fight me over here.
[6866.24s -> 6867.24s]  Do I hear a bonfire?
[6868.14s -> 6870.64s]  What is shooting me through the fucking wall, dude?
[6886.46s -> 6887.46s]  That was so stupid.
[6887.46s -> 6888.56s]  Why did I do that?
[6892.06s -> 6894.86s]  This is the worst place to fight this fucking boss.
[6896.16s -> 6898.66s]  This is such a shitty place to do this.
[6899.46s -> 6899.96s]  He's like
[6903.73s -> 6905.33s]  he's just fucked up.
[6909.49s -> 6910.59s]  Oh no, that's the bug.
[6910.59s -> 6911.49s]  Why did I jump down?
[6911.49s -> 6912.39s]  Because I don't know.
[6912.39s -> 6916.09s]  I was just like too lazy to I'm so done with this area.
[6916.49s -> 6929.80s]  I just I'm just waiting to skip over Worcester is the dog
[6929.80s -> 6931.90s]  enemy does that thing where they jump in the air and they
[6931.90s -> 6935.00s]  just like leap across the whole game and he's just doing
[6935.00s -> 6937.10s]  that in random spots where there's like no way to go.
[6943.48s -> 6944.48s]  I'm killing this dog.
[6949.10s -> 6950.50s]  I'm killing this dog right now.
[6957.45s -> 6960.85s]  I'm clearing this entire zone and then me and this stupid
[6960.85s -> 6962.15s]  ass dog are gonna have a fight.
[6962.75s -> 6966.95s]  I think I'm near a grave, but I can't remember exactly
[6966.95s -> 6967.25s]  where it is.
[6967.25s -> 6967.85s]  I'm scared.
[6967.85s -> 6968.65s]  I'm stuck now.
[6970.42s -> 6971.92s]  I think it's like in here to the left.
[6976.44s -> 6978.94s]  Somebody shoot me from arrows of across the whole game.
[6980.56s -> 6982.16s]  It's almost like this is completely random.
[6982.46s -> 6983.26s]  Who would have thought?
[6989.43s -> 6991.13s]  I could just equip my ninjitsu.
[6991.33s -> 6992.33s]  I run fast.
[6996.62s -> 6997.22s]  Fuck this.
[7004.05s -> 7008.75s]  Fuck albanerk throwing fucking Krillin's Destructo disc.
[7011.49s -> 7013.69s]  Yo, I know there's one down here.
[7013.69s -> 7014.99s]  I'm so glad you're as upset as I am.
[7016.74s -> 7018.14s]  I'm just so lost.
[7018.44s -> 7021.24s]  I feel like I've walked past like three bonfires.
[7024.64s -> 7025.44s]  Get up here.
[7027.53s -> 7028.93s]  I'm not fucking around right now.
[7028.93s -> 7029.63s]  Get up here.
[7046.40s -> 7046.80s]  I did it.
[7046.90s -> 7047.40s]  I got a great.
[7047.70s -> 7048.10s]  I did it.
[7048.40s -> 7048.90s]  I did it.
[7050.13s -> 7050.63s]  No.
[7068.36s -> 7070.20s]  Okay, I'm opening my world to you.
[7078.41s -> 7081.21s]  It is super incredibly super laggy here because there's
[7081.21s -> 7082.71s]  another bird with her head in the ceiling.
[7083.41s -> 7084.91s]  And I just imagine all the birds are girls.
[7084.91s -> 7086.21s]  I don't know if that's like a problem.
[7086.51s -> 7089.21s]  I don't know if like that's something I need to take back.
[7089.91s -> 7091.81s]  I'm so fucking mad right now.
[7098.36s -> 7105.51s]  Jerma Jerma you just got exercised Jerma.
[7108.21s -> 7109.71s]  I am joining your world right now.
[7109.71s -> 7112.41s]  Okay, I'm concerned because there's been a couple times
[7112.41s -> 7114.61s]  in recent history where you like don't hear anything I say.
[7115.21s -> 7115.51s]  All right.
[7115.51s -> 7116.31s]  Here I am.
[7116.31s -> 7117.01s]  What's up?
[7117.01s -> 7118.21s]  Oh, thank goodness.
[7119.18s -> 7120.68s]  You have no idea guys.
[7120.68s -> 7123.88s]  Welcome back from Elden Ring gameplay me and that dog down
[7123.88s -> 7124.28s]  there.
[7124.28s -> 7125.48s]  I've got a bone to pick with that dog.
[7125.78s -> 7131.59s]  I'm just saying I we need to go kill that dog at some point.
[7133.08s -> 7135.58s]  I think I open the shortcut to the dog to our right.
[7135.58s -> 7136.98s]  Oh, this is so bad.
[7136.98s -> 7137.38s]  Yeah.
[7137.38s -> 7138.98s]  What if something's here right to our left?
[7138.98s -> 7141.08s]  There's a that bird has its head in the ceiling.
[7156.40s -> 7157.60s]  Okay, please go away.
[7157.60s -> 7158.00s]  All right.
[7160.64s -> 7164.28s]  So all right, that was fun.
[7169.48s -> 7172.88s]  Oh dude, he's three-fingered of the frenzied flag to you.
[7172.88s -> 7173.68s]  Did you see that?
[7174.08s -> 7175.98s]  That's really cool that you would take my joke.
[7176.38s -> 7176.78s]  Yep.
[7180.43s -> 7182.93s]  Yeah, I think if you really want to kill the dog, it's the
[7182.93s -> 7185.53s]  shortcut door what they were saying to climb the ladder,
[7185.53s -> 7186.63s]  but this door was closed.
[7186.63s -> 7187.33s]  This is the ladder.
[7187.33s -> 7189.33s]  And this is the ladder and this was locked.
[7189.83s -> 7190.93s]  Yeah, dogs down there.
[7190.93s -> 7192.43s]  So I was doing that for pretty much no reason.
[7192.43s -> 7193.63s]  I would have had to go around the whole thing.
[7193.73s -> 7196.13s]  Oh man, no, then you come in here.
[7196.43s -> 7197.63s]  Do you want to fight the dog?
[7197.83s -> 7198.73s]  Do you not care?
[7198.83s -> 7200.43s]  Do you like killing dogs?
[7203.55s -> 7204.85s]  I'm going to give the dog a name.
[7205.05s -> 7205.85s]  That's Ralphie.
[7206.73s -> 7207.73s]  Oh, that's cool.
[7207.73s -> 7208.93s]  No, I like Ralphie.
[7210.15s -> 7210.65s]  All right, let's go.
[7210.65s -> 7212.95s]  Yeah, Ralphie just like he was protecting his area.
[7212.95s -> 7216.15s]  But now that like he knows you he like warmed up to you.
[7216.15s -> 7217.65s]  It's left this way other way.
[7219.38s -> 7228.44s]  Oh, that's a cool dog is Ralphie.
[7228.44s -> 7229.84s]  Yeah, talk like it.
[7230.84s -> 7231.24s]  Yes.
[7231.54s -> 7232.84s]  I love that character now.
[7234.71s -> 7236.71s]  I don't even I have no problem with that character at all.
[7241.44s -> 7244.84s]  Now this guy's name is Craig and he's a fucking tax auditor.
[7245.64s -> 7246.04s]  What?
[7251.06s -> 7253.36s]  Wait, who when you're fighting right now?
[7253.86s -> 7255.06s]  No, the guy you just killed.
[7255.56s -> 7259.77s]  Oh guy.
[7259.77s -> 7262.77s]  I killed his Krillin wannabe Krillin.
[7263.57s -> 7266.57s]  Yeah from Dragon Ball Z.
[7267.86s -> 7268.96s]  No, this is barf drinker.
[7269.46s -> 7272.16s]  He was throwing the light disks.
[7272.76s -> 7274.26s]  I've never seen an albino do it.
[7275.06s -> 7275.96s]  I don't know why he's doing it.
[7281.79s -> 7283.29s]  Destructo disk.
[7292.52s -> 7300.10s]  So this character's name is where did you go up the stairs?
[7300.90s -> 7303.77s]  Okay, this character.
[7303.87s -> 7304.57s]  This is it.
[7305.81s -> 7310.51s]  This is glow blob and Snaily and their best friends and they
[7310.51s -> 7321.28s]  are doing come up with a better backstory.
[7342.70s -> 7343.60s]  Not cool.
[7344.96s -> 7346.66s]  What did it be really epic?
[7347.26s -> 7349.36s]  No, I thought this guy's a statue.
[7352.38s -> 7355.38s]  What would be epic if I could take my hat off and use it like
[7355.38s -> 7355.98s]  a shield?
[7358.43s -> 7359.13s]  That would be pretty cool.
[7364.30s -> 7365.60s]  Oh, I got lightning Ram.
[7370.63s -> 7379.40s]  Careful careful.
[7379.40s -> 7380.80s]  I ran this whole way.
[7381.40s -> 7387.02s]  You did you need a better backstory for that hat stir.
[7387.02s -> 7391.12s]  Yeah, I don't know why this is a foggy because it's one of
[7391.12s -> 7392.92s]  those keys.
[7394.12s -> 7395.92s]  Oh the kiss me keys.
[7403.06s -> 7416.50s]  Wait, why can I not attack what a coherent array of enemies?
[7420.04s -> 7422.24s]  Oh my god, I'm gonna fucking die.
[7424.39s -> 7425.89s]  Guy has like a super sword.
[7426.09s -> 7427.49s]  You just hear a car horn.
[7429.65s -> 7431.25s]  I think it was somebody blowing a horn up here.
[7432.57s -> 7435.07s]  I thought like I heard like a truck on the highway.
[7435.37s -> 7449.21s]  So there is an item in here, but I don't know it was worth using
[7449.21s -> 7453.51s]  the key but none of these gargoyles are worth using keys
[7453.51s -> 7455.31s]  on because I got the painting.
[7457.62s -> 7459.92s]  I got the dragon scale blade.
[7460.32s -> 7461.12s]  That sounds pretty cool.
[7462.09s -> 7463.69s]  Yeah, I don't I don't remember that item.
[7470.60s -> 7479.26s]  Okay, so millennia I guess is the plan.
[7479.36s -> 7482.79s]  I am millennia blade of Micola.
[7485.11s -> 7497.92s]  Now that's not good.
[7499.74s -> 7502.34s]  Just kind of came you look like you came out of the actual
[7502.34s -> 7503.44s]  stone from the wall.
[7506.24s -> 7507.24s]  He's not doing anything.
[7508.24s -> 7509.24s]  He's got a lot of health.
[7509.34s -> 7512.14s]  I don't it's not worth it for the fucking bin beast bones.
[7512.14s -> 7513.24s]  We're gonna get for killing this guy.
[7516.46s -> 7517.06s]  Coward.
[7517.36s -> 7517.86s]  Okay.
[7519.41s -> 7521.51s]  I actually I don't I don't like this.
[7521.71s -> 7522.41s]  I'm dead.
[7523.74s -> 7526.14s]  I was there was a wizard behind me.
[7526.74s -> 7529.24s]  I don't know where he came from because we cleared everything
[7529.64s -> 7536.55s]  but I turned around and there was a wizard isn't that much
[7536.55s -> 7541.37s]  health but don't think it's worth it.
[7541.87s -> 7542.67s]  But here I am.
[7542.97s -> 7543.57s]  Nonetheless.
[7544.61s -> 7545.71s]  Oh, it's this one.
[7545.71s -> 7546.71s]  Oh, never mind.
[7547.75s -> 7548.65s]  I don't want to fight this fucking thing.
[7548.65s -> 7550.95s]  This is the other this is the second one when there's a
[7550.95s -> 7551.85s]  little lightning moves.
[7552.75s -> 7554.26s]  Dying.
[7554.56s -> 7555.06s]  Uh-huh.
[7556.44s -> 7556.94s]  Don't die.
[7558.52s -> 7559.32s]  Just don't do it.
[7559.62s -> 7560.62s]  Okay, just say no.
[7561.02s -> 7561.32s]  All right.
[7561.32s -> 7562.32s]  I'm not going to die.
[7569.43s -> 7569.93s]  I'm dead.
[7570.73s -> 7571.93s]  I mean, it's kind of not.
[7572.90s -> 7573.10s]  I don't know.
[7573.10s -> 7574.30s]  Why did we fight him?
[7574.40s -> 7576.30s]  You were so you wanted to fight him so bad.
[7576.90s -> 7578.10s]  I didn't know there was a wizard.
[7580.34s -> 7581.74s]  He is a wizard.
[7585.10s -> 7587.10s]  I'm holding this deep off because I was coming back to
[7587.10s -> 7587.60s]  help.
[7593.43s -> 7594.23s]  Oh god damn it.
[7594.23s -> 7597.43s]  The fucking big turkey thing is back and everything lags.
[7599.71s -> 7601.41s]  Yeah, and then and then you rest it.
[7601.91s -> 7602.81s]  That's real cool.
[7603.11s -> 7604.81s]  You would you would rest.
[7605.11s -> 7608.64s]  I just this place sucks.
[7609.24s -> 7611.46s]  You're fighting a turkey alone.
[7612.43s -> 7615.23s]  I have to kill this thing like I just do right.
[7617.87s -> 7618.27s]  Yeah.
[7633.02s -> 7633.92s]  Okay, it's dead.
[7639.32s -> 7639.62s]  All right.
[7641.51s -> 7643.91s]  I have I don't it's I have not burned into my short-term
[7643.91s -> 7647.51s]  memory where to go at all in this fucking goddamn maze
[7647.51s -> 7649.91s]  of a place up the stairs.
[7652.04s -> 7664.03s]  And then you're basically there being gate kept.
[7664.03s -> 7665.73s]  He's going after Ralphie.
[7666.53s -> 7667.33s]  Don't say that.
[7678.45s -> 7679.35s]  All right, let's move.
[7680.92s -> 7681.82s]  All right, squat up.
[7681.82s -> 7683.02s]  We don't want to get three-fingered.
[7687.44s -> 7689.24s]  I went right by my head, dude.
[7689.24s -> 7691.34s]  Please watch where you're casting your spells.
[7691.34s -> 7692.34s]  I didn't mean to press that.
[7692.34s -> 7693.34s]  I don't know what I pressed.
[7696.72s -> 7699.62s]  I just turned to you and looked and all of my eyebrows
[7699.62s -> 7700.02s]  were gone.
[7701.18s -> 7701.68s]  Like Mike.
[7701.78s -> 7703.68s]  I just turned and looked as excuse me.
[7704.18s -> 7705.58s]  It was right by my face.
[7705.78s -> 7706.28s]  Oh shit.
[7706.28s -> 7706.78s]  He's back.
[7706.78s -> 7707.28s]  I forgot.
[7707.38s -> 7709.08s]  All right, just leave just leave don't even fight it.
[7709.88s -> 7710.28s]  Okay.
[7720.00s -> 7720.40s]  Okay.
[7721.10s -> 7723.70s]  Oh, I know it's annoying from downtown.
[7723.70s -> 7726.40s]  I was trying to lose him up and you can't be serious.
[7726.80s -> 7728.30s]  I refuse to die from that.
[7730.20s -> 7732.40s]  I don't know when he's going to cast this thing and it's like
[7732.60s -> 7733.40s]  I can hear it.
[7733.40s -> 7735.80s]  It's like fucking sizzling like bacon in a pan.
[7737.04s -> 7739.78s]  It's like and then it happens.
[7745.48s -> 7749.38s]  I don't know if there's a closer rest, but that's millennia.
[7749.78s -> 7750.18s]  All right.
[7750.58s -> 7752.38s]  Hopefully it's just a phase one.
[7753.76s -> 7755.36s]  Hopefully it's just a phase mom.
[7755.66s -> 7756.36s]  It's just phase one.
[7756.36s -> 7760.66s]  Then we should be all right and you very famously beat millennia
[7760.66s -> 7761.56s]  without a problem at all.
[7761.56s -> 7762.66s]  So I'm leaving this up to you.
[7763.26s -> 7765.86s]  You'll be my mimic tear except worse.
[7802.59s -> 7803.39s]  I'm so slow.
[7803.39s -> 7804.79s]  I still have the debuff.
[7810.92s -> 7811.82s]  Oh this thing.
[7817.76s -> 7818.56s]  I'm dead, dude.
[7822.19s -> 7823.39s]  I forgot she could do that.
[7830.69s -> 7837.05s]  Yeah, I really haven't seen her moveset in a hot minute.
[7839.84s -> 7840.84s]  It is just for Neo.
[7840.84s -> 7842.14s]  I would have fucking rolled her.
[7846.24s -> 7849.78s]  I hope this is the phase two then we're in a lot of trouble.
[7853.86s -> 7855.86s]  It actually might be impossible to dodge it in this room.
[7858.06s -> 7858.96s]  I have a new strategy.
[7861.66s -> 7862.46s]  Here's the strategy.
[7863.22s -> 7870.01s]  You hear me loading a new strap.
[7870.01s -> 7870.71s]  We get there.
[7870.71s -> 7872.91s]  We don't have a debuff because I was like, I don't know.
[7872.91s -> 7874.11s]  I had like a move speed debuff.
[7874.11s -> 7877.61s]  So all my rolls were like slowed behind the pillar when she
[7877.61s -> 7880.71s]  winds up with that actually stop her from attacking him.
[7881.89s -> 7882.89s]  She could get stuck on him.
[7882.89s -> 7884.39s]  Yeah on kill the lag bird.
[7899.80s -> 7901.50s]  There's got to be a closer bonfire.
[7902.48s -> 7903.58s]  It might not be.
[7904.87s -> 7907.57s]  I think lifting up the bridge is like the way to do a short
[7907.57s -> 7908.07s]  cut here.
[7910.48s -> 7912.88s]  Just do a kite around the pillar.
[7913.28s -> 7914.58s]  Yeah, I was thinking just DPS.
[7914.58s -> 7918.18s]  I was thinking just just R1 R1 R1 because she staggers.
[7919.44s -> 7920.04s]  Excuse me.
[7920.54s -> 7921.84s]  Oh, it's fucking Barry.
[7922.04s -> 7922.84s]  He's blocked it.
[7923.94s -> 7925.74s]  Or whatever his name was Barry.
[7926.24s -> 7927.04s]  Clamula.
[7927.04s -> 7927.64s]  I don't know.
[7929.64s -> 7930.64s]  I didn't give them names.
[7930.64s -> 7931.84s]  You killed them before I could.
[7932.34s -> 7933.14s]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[7933.14s -> 7939.32s]  It was named it was like slimy or something.
[7939.52s -> 7944.84s]  I don't know the elevator cage will get back here faster, but
[7944.84s -> 7945.94s]  we're not going to have to worry about it because we're going
[7945.94s -> 7954.85s]  to finish it right now is the strategy is seriously just like
[7954.85s -> 7956.15s]  one try millennia right now.
[7957.05s -> 7960.05s]  I kind of think it has to be because last try doesn't count
[7960.05s -> 7961.65s]  and people think it counts and that's kind of weird.
[7962.53s -> 7967.92s]  But like we had debuffs and it didn't count if there is just
[7967.92s -> 7970.12s]  a phase one that would be huge, but I don't think it is.
[7971.99s -> 7973.49s]  You've never even seen this boss before.
[7973.49s -> 7973.89s]  What is it?
[7977.84s -> 7980.40s]  What did that to me?
[7980.50s -> 7982.70s]  What way he's coming?
[7984.12s -> 7984.62s]  He's got.
[7984.62s -> 7985.42s]  Oh my God.
[7985.42s -> 7987.62s]  He is that was such a horrible feeling.
[7988.02s -> 7995.74s]  He's been that close the whole time and we didn't even
[7995.74s -> 7997.46s]  we were just nonchalantly just kind of running.
[7999.16s -> 7999.66s]  All right.
[8000.43s -> 8000.73s]  All right.
[8000.73s -> 8001.03s]  Come on.
[8001.03s -> 8001.63s]  Let's do it.
[8003.59s -> 8006.09s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait saying
[8006.09s -> 8012.08s]  The this is faster apparently and we don't have to worry about that fucking horse guy
[8012.88s -> 8021.37s]  Is it faster though? Get in here. Is there a bonfire down there? Oh, it's there get in here. Get in get in
[8021.89s -> 8032.61s]  There I mean, I'm this is down. Oh
[8035.13s -> 8040.41s]  Yeah, oh, I know what they mean. We would go down by the dog and then run up here
[8040.81s -> 8042.81s]  Because we open the shortcut by the ladder
[8044.48s -> 8047.31s]  Okay, then you run up around this way and you avoid
[8048.64s -> 8052.84s]  It's still pretty not it's still pretty it's comparable
[8053.44s -> 8071.37s]  Back by the bridge. All right. Well, let's do it. I just win just win. Aren't you like big into parries?
[8072.05s -> 8079.71s]  Yeah, you want me to parry her? No, I know you're gonna start and you're gonna be mad because I told you to do it
[8079.71s -> 8082.79s]  You'd be like you told me to parry and I haven't practiced
[8083.23s -> 8101.95s]  Get these benches out of the way so we can actually when she goes in the air just hide behind a pillar
[8102.47s -> 8130.25s]  We just use the pillars regardless just hide behind them. Why'd you tell me to parry? That's what I'm saying. That's a don't
[8131.01s -> 8138.95s]  What the fuck?
[8142.06s -> 8143.42s]  You good
[8143.42s -> 8156.94s]  She went for the grab to grab you and she grabbed like the side of my ear and fucking skewered me
[8156.94s -> 8168.80s]  I hate this boss so much. I think on a good day. I wouldn't be worried. It's not a good day. I
[8170.32s -> 8173.80s]  Want to block everything she's doing and you're not allowed to block in this game
[8173.80s -> 8179.28s]  I'm just so paranoid that she's gonna do the stupid water dance. It's gonna one-shot us. So I'm just playing so timidly and
[8179.92s -> 8185.00s]  Then she grabs you by my ear and just picks me up and sticks the sword through my stomach
[8185.52s -> 8195.69s]  It's only one phase though
[8196.37s -> 8207.42s]  Out this way and then we have to go I forget
[8209.39s -> 8211.39s]  Boogers just came out of my nose
[8212.37s -> 8216.85s]  Boogie boogers just like shot out of my nose because it's like this is we're picking to go this way
[8217.37s -> 8221.49s]  Deliberately and I don't know why because this is gonna be way worse than the other way
[8222.81s -> 8226.65s]  This is wrong. Look at how much worse this is. It's just Ralphie. I
[8227.29s -> 8232.45s]  Just don't know where to go. Why did you go this way? Why did you go this weird-ass way?
[8233.25s -> 8235.25s]  Which way you supposed to go?
[8235.45s -> 8236.81s]  wait
[8236.81s -> 8243.23s]  Well, I don't know you decided I didn't want to come this way I was like, oh, I don't think we should do this
[8243.23s -> 8251.63s]  Oh up this way. I don't want my dog. He's a nice dog. He just doesn't know you
[8252.15s -> 8267.54s]  Actually, this might be better. I don't like the synchronized elevator. Yeah, that's gonna mess us up at some point. I think I
[8274.52s -> 8279.44s]  Spent like four hours fighting millennia at least
[8280.00s -> 8282.92s]  This is this is like a thing. I don't ever want to see again
[8282.92s -> 8285.52s]  I think I actually said after I beat millennia see in the regular game
[8285.56s -> 8287.48s]  I was like, yeah, I'm never doing this ever again
[8287.48s -> 8291.68s]  I would beat the whole area cuz like that that Halleke tree area is pretty cool
[8291.76s -> 8295.44s]  But before getting to this fog gate, I would just leave on any other playthrough
[8296.16s -> 8298.97s]  Well, it's not any other playthrough
[8299.93s -> 8304.67s]  It's the playthrough. It was way more than four hours. It was like 14
[8305.59s -> 8307.47s]  No, it was not
[8307.47s -> 8314.38s]  Yeah, I don't even know what buttons
[8314.78s -> 8334.13s]  The strategy good strategy careful get back. She's gonna go in the air. She's gonna go in the air. I had behind a pillar
[8339.97s -> 8347.32s]  Nice. Nice. Just keep doing wait. She's gonna go up here. She's up. She's up
[8347.84s -> 8354.59s]  She's gonna come for you. She doesn't give a shit. It kind of works. It kind of works
[8355.31s -> 8366.70s]  Not doing it again. Are you how many fucking times do you do that? It works though? It works. You just can't get close. I
[8372.84s -> 8375.84s]  Just can't even drink out of my fucking flask. I
[8376.40s -> 8384.37s]  Hate this boss so much just delete it from the fucking whole game. It works. It works
[8384.37s -> 8393.58s]  I mean, I thought we were gonna fight her you were hiding most of the fight because and I survived but then
[8393.74s -> 8400.61s]  She did that thing where oh you have you taken some damage, bro. Don't worry. I ain't gonna let you do shit
[8400.61s -> 8406.33s]  I'm just gonna be like right like right behind you the whole time and I'm gonna be swinging like every you know, one two
[8406.65s -> 8411.33s]  Three four one two don't you can't drink in this game. No, of course you're fighting millennia
[8411.33s -> 8413.85s]  Like just fuck just just turn around and run around just run away
[8414.77s -> 8419.64s]  We have the debuff. Did you sit down?
[8419.72s -> 8426.07s]  Do we think so when we both die? We don't get one. Oh, okay. I think we have no we don't
[8426.67s -> 8438.91s]  Fucking one guy. I hate millennia's entire move set. Oh my god. I've already wasted flasks
[8440.73s -> 8449.74s]  Reset it's a skill issue. I don't care. I don't care. Fuck that boss. I
[8451.67s -> 8455.47s]  Despise this boss. I hate this boss with a burning passion
[8455.95s -> 8470.81s]  It's the worst boss they've ever made. It's worse than better chaos. Come on. You hit me with that
[8471.37s -> 8491.42s]  All right, we're in worse than better chaos, dude. You okay?
[8492.06s -> 8502.63s]  We're winning you're gonna fight her and we're gonna win me and better chaos like smoke a blunt together and hang out and shit
[8502.63s -> 8507.82s]  Like me millennia. No, don't call me. I don't want to hang out. She can call me
[8513.82s -> 8516.19s]  Okay, let's do this, please
[8517.87s -> 8519.87s]  Nightmare blunt rotation
[8525.10s -> 8551.87s]  Whatever you're gonna fight her dude, I'm waiting for the opportunity you why did you jump?
[8555.02s -> 8563.25s]  Mode I'm on block her attacks and jump. All right, listen when she does the dance thing. Don't go too close to the pillar
[8563.93s -> 8567.20s]  It's just enough to like like keep it right here. Oh
[8568.32s -> 8572.96s]  No, oh no, the solution the solution's over. Oh, no
[8573.48s -> 8578.68s]  She was in the right spot. Can you play your own game and take your own advice next time dude? She was
[8579.32s -> 8581.32s]  Excuse me. What's happening here?
[8582.28s -> 8588.16s]  She from where she killed you she kept doing that move across the whole map
[8588.84s -> 8590.88s]  She did it backwards
[8590.88s -> 8600.82s]  It doesn't work. It does but it's you got to get it right her attack has that
[8601.18s -> 8605.72s]  Spot in the middle where it the circle has to be right in the middle of the pillar
[8605.72s -> 8620.83s]  I don't think we have to kill this bird if we go the other way. Maybe all right, maybe call me crazy
[8622.20s -> 8628.38s]  Let's just let's just attack her and just don't even let her do any moves
[8632.36s -> 8640.36s]  Dude I can't like this fucking way such asshole. It's do we just jump down into a rave
[8645.04s -> 8650.07s]  See what I was doing my only only jump attacks, right?
[8650.07s -> 8652.07s]  I
[8652.67s -> 8658.23s]  Rock to run around the pillars and just wait for you to do something. Can you scoot up a little I feel like I'm gonna fall
[8658.99s -> 8662.78s]  Okay
[8662.78s -> 8668.92s]  Jump attacks only I'm thinking and just try to get the stagger and then one of us does the attack
[8669.18s -> 8672.60s]  Let me put on that thing though. Where is it?
[8673.46s -> 8702.95s]  Okay, try to get the stagger. Don't even think about it. It's not even think just just going it kind of worked
[8703.39s -> 8716.23s]  God, dude
[8716.23s -> 8732.39s]  What the fuck working? It's working
[8744.88s -> 8752.24s]  That's mommy time. It's working
[8756.40s -> 8757.60s]  lagging
[8757.60s -> 8759.60s]  Like oh don't say that now
[8760.00s -> 8767.63s]  lagging I
[8767.63s -> 8772.59s]  Why did I do that? What the fuck was I thinking? I could have jumped. Why did I do the fire move?
[8772.59s -> 8777.59s]  I wanted to be so flashy for no fucking reason. I don't know why you would use the fire move. I
[8778.19s -> 8781.43s]  Just figured I had an opportunity. I had isn't you could you got it. You got it
[8781.43s -> 8788.15s]  You got it. You're like that guy that killed millennia like 30,000 times that what the let me solo her
[8788.15s -> 8805.22s]  It's just channel that energy. You can do it. Okay, we strayed from the plan. I needed to run
[8805.22s -> 8809.46s]  I needed to just go into light stance and start running and get the better dodge
[8809.68s -> 8813.94s]  We had the strategy and it worked. I have a question
[8814.18s -> 8818.46s]  We took her down to half health with jump attacks and she didn't get staggered once what's going on?
[8818.46s -> 8826.14s]  Oh, you mean like neat like on the knee stagger. Just like boom. How come we can't get it?
[8826.14s -> 8830.06s]  Oh, yeah, and you have to parry her three times to get like an actual Barry
[8830.46s -> 8832.88s]  You oh, yeah, like yeah
[8833.58s -> 8844.36s]  Fuck that. I love going this way. You actually do and it's like it's annoying. I
[8847.40s -> 8850.29s]  like running
[8850.29s -> 8852.61s]  Nothing attacking you and just like watching your health bar
[8853.29s -> 8869.95s]  It actually works out sometimes though. I'm glad you expected me to be right behind you. I looked behind me
[8873.76s -> 8877.03s]  Without even turning my head. Okay. I am
[8877.71s -> 8880.95s]  millennia killer blade of Micaela killer
[8881.43s -> 8885.08s]  Let's just go I kill her
[8886.47s -> 8893.17s]  To do it when she goes up in the air. We are full sprinting to the other side of the Coliseum
[8893.93s -> 8895.19s]  Okay
[8895.19s -> 8917.53s]  Watch that stamina burn. Yeah people she cheated that was cheating. Oh
[8924.77s -> 8926.41s]  No
[8926.41s -> 8948.64s]  Whatever happened to run across the game. I mean we were both in the middle of attacks. It's fine
[8948.64s -> 8953.32s]  I've seen you do this once I
[8953.40s -> 8955.40s]  Never saw it actually
[8955.64s -> 8963.49s]  Watch out for the sword
[8963.53s -> 8965.53s]  brilliant brilliant
[8965.65s -> 9019.54s]  You did it twice in a fucking row that move is such horse shit twice in a row two times in a row two two
[9019.78s -> 9025.94s]  We have it. I feel like um, you know before when I called the jump before I made the jump
[9025.94s -> 9031.92s]  I feel it in my soul. This is the one you know, I'm saying that was bullshit
[9031.96s -> 9039.98s]  No, I want anybody and don't even talk about it. We don't even do that patience. Keep hitting her
[9040.06s -> 9042.53s]  You know, she when she's gonna go up we just run
[9042.53s -> 9049.88s]  I got distracted because she got she went down on her knees and she was like, please please kill me and like I
[9050.78s -> 9057.03s]  Couldn't say no, but now I know better. She didn't do that move twice in a row. I beat her I
[9057.55s -> 9064.17s]  Was in the zone. It's cuz we missed the stab
[9064.17s -> 9068.41s]  I thought you were gonna get the stab and then she was up too quick. Yeah, it's too quick
[9068.77s -> 9074.40s]  But like this time get a safe distance before you heal
[9074.52s -> 9076.64s]  Well, the problem is when she does that move twice in a row
[9076.64s -> 9080.20s]  She covers so much ground that even you just don't know what moves coming next
[9080.32s -> 9084.88s]  So you think about what what does she have in her arsenal and she just did that move?
[9084.88s -> 9087.86s]  So in your brain you go that's not happening a second time
[9087.86s -> 9088.80s]  She's gonna do something else
[9088.80s -> 9093.86s]  But if it happens twice in a row it throws off your brain and it's just like that's not good
[9093.86s -> 9100.67s]  I was nice you never expect the same move to happen twice in a row. You always like oh, yeah
[9100.67s -> 9103.83s]  I just dodged that so what's the next one? Let's go. Let's go
[9104.55s -> 9109.52s]  Jump jump on her
[9109.60s -> 9111.60s]  How did I jump all the way around her?
[9111.80s -> 9122.81s]  Good good. Good. Be careful though. I
[9125.23s -> 9132.20s]  Don't have enough 30 run. She's behind filler. Keep her there
[9149.24s -> 9156.63s]  Stop making funny references careful
[9162.03s -> 9168.89s]  You're probably gonna go up
[9168.89s -> 9173.50s]  staggered staggered
[9173.50s -> 9180.76s]  She could end this right now if she goes up. So just be very careful. Let's just play like a coward. Seriously
[9181.28s -> 9184.09s]  I
[9185.01s -> 9189.49s]  Know what I know she was gonna do it
[9189.89s -> 9191.89s]  There's some advice for you
[9191.93s -> 9197.49s]  Holy shit. You got him. You got him. All right. All right. All right. All right
[9198.09s -> 9212.03s]  We did it what? Oh
[9212.31s -> 9214.31s]  It's the second phase. Oh
[9215.43s -> 9219.52s]  No
[9219.76s -> 9224.76s]  What there's a cutscene how come how come how come oh
[9226.36s -> 9239.51s]  She's up
[9239.51s -> 9241.19s]  It's gonna happen
[9241.19s -> 9254.11s]  Yeah, she got me. It's fine. You can do this as long as she doesn't do I kill you
[9254.67s -> 9257.03s]  I've got fucking rot in two seconds, dude. I
[9257.59s -> 9268.98s]  Already have it there's over with rot too. No, no fucking way. This is literally fucking impossible in this room
[9269.74s -> 9283.80s]  Runs over runs over that pause. That's the only boss so far that has actually like regained health and gone to a phase two
[9283.84s -> 9285.76s]  Oh we can use
[9285.76s -> 9292.24s]  We can use spirit summons. No, you want to just like ding-a-ling-ling-ling and bring up
[9292.96s -> 9298.72s]  You will you will lose all respect from everyone who ever respected its randomizer. That doesn't matter
[9300.80s -> 9305.32s]  Dude, I'm telling you I think I think we ding-a-ling two teachers in here and we just fucking destroyer
[9305.32s -> 9311.16s]  I mean, that's your call if you want a ding-a-ling. I
[9311.68s -> 9320.76s]  Love how we spent so we spent the last two hours straight. I'm trying to get here
[9321.16s -> 9324.74s]  But we don't even have to do this this is optional
[9325.22s -> 9334.52s]  Yeah, we could probably do it. How much do you care go again? Okay?
[9336.21s -> 9338.77s]  We had we just weren't like mentally prepared for a phase two
[9338.77s -> 9344.45s]  We actually were not our mental crack the moment. She like teleported into the sky. It's very true
[9344.93s -> 9354.90s]  Phase one's easy as long as we like respect the you die
[9355.70s -> 9365.36s]  Millennia is a horseshit. You need you should just ding-a-ling this
[9365.52s -> 9376.50s]  You need you should just ding-a-ling this you should both use the boys so you get 20 people in the room that actually really funny
[9384.42s -> 9388.77s]  Fucking millennia, of course, you knew she was gonna show up at some point
[9389.41s -> 9391.80s]  It's just this is a really bad room for her to be in
[9394.08s -> 9398.04s]  Alright, what room would you have liked her to be in something that has?
[9399.28s -> 9401.16s]  a hundred percent more area to run around in
[9401.68s -> 9443.60s]  Alright, let's do it. Oh my god. I just fucking hate this piece of shit so much
[9444.16s -> 9448.49s]  I fucking hate this boss so much. I hate this place. I hate this boss
[9448.81s -> 9454.27s]  Okay, then your call like we can run away. We can come back later
[9454.99s -> 9456.99s]  We can get plus 50 swords
[9457.15s -> 9458.70s]  um
[9458.70s -> 9461.80s]  We're trying to like this. Let's go play truth or dare
[9462.36s -> 9467.80s]  All right, let's come on. I'm doing it like this. I feel like looking at it from a different perspective. It's a good idea
[9470.91s -> 9475.64s]  I'm gonna play upside down
[9476.20s -> 9478.76s]  Dog got me dog got me
[9486.12s -> 9496.25s]  God
[9496.25s -> 9499.29s]  All right, this is the last attempt and we're just going out splato
[9500.11s -> 9515.72s]  Okay, it's so close to hitting you
[9519.10s -> 9521.95s]  You're too slow
[9521.95s -> 9524.73s]  your host
[9524.73s -> 9526.73s]  I meant the guy who tried to scare me
[9527.37s -> 9538.06s]  I'm gonna save my dingulings for phase two
[9538.78s -> 9548.78s]  Smart. Oh, that's not good. She's coming for me. I'm dead
[9551.98s -> 9556.09s]  Like we're hitting their same amount and before she was staggering
[9556.81s -> 9561.45s]  So i'm kind of like expecting the stagger before she goes sicko mode and we're not getting it
[9562.84s -> 9564.84s]  I need you to there's no way I can do this alone
[9565.40s -> 9566.52s]  Although
[9566.52s -> 9571.40s]  Okay, kill it kill yourself. Hold on unless you feel the vibe literally. I need one more
[9572.44s -> 9573.56s]  Okay
[9573.56s -> 9575.56s]  I need one more. I need it
[9575.80s -> 9589.10s]  This is the last one no matter what as long as we're careful when she's at the the doomsday threshold
[9589.98s -> 9594.94s]  What am I sipping?
[9594.94s -> 9596.94s]  This is a green tea
[9597.34s -> 9600.83s]  Uh drink powder. I like it a lot
[9601.39s -> 9602.67s]  It's yummy
[9602.67s -> 9607.40s]  It's got a little bit of caffeine to give you a little bit. It's tasty
[9607.96s -> 9615.82s]  It's good
[9615.82s -> 9620.86s]  I read that. Um, the green tea the powder comes from like they grind up goblins
[9624.76s -> 9626.76s]  I'm gonna fucking die to this
[9627.16s -> 9631.84s]  I'm fucking gonna die
[9633.44s -> 9637.02s]  Goblins, uh
[9639.24s -> 9642.64s]  I don't think that's how it happened. I think it's
[9643.44s -> 9647.79s]  Hold on. What is it?
[9647.79s -> 9650.76s]  It's a tea leaf
[9650.76s -> 9653.92s]  They grind that up. Have you ever seen someone do it?
[9654.88s -> 9657.44s]  Yeah, actually
[9657.44s -> 9659.87s]  Like the actual leaf
[9659.87s -> 9661.87s]  I yes, i've seen it
[9666.67s -> 9670.67s]  Okay, first person to get first person to get hit by milania. What was the other person 20 bucks?
[9671.15s -> 9673.71s]  Why do you just keep like trying to financially ruin me?
[9675.48s -> 9676.92s]  I'm just saying
[9676.92s -> 9681.50s]  Well, that's gonna make you play like a little baby boy. We gotta get fucking in there
[9682.38s -> 9685.64s]  Get her
[9686.12s -> 9688.12s]  You owe me 20
[9688.36s -> 9692.81s]  I'm trying to lighten the mood man. The mood is light
[9693.69s -> 9695.13s]  Light her up
[9695.13s -> 9705.10s]  There's a lot of damage. I'm in the camera. I'm expecting it. Yep
[9708.83s -> 9710.35s]  She snuck around
[9710.35s -> 9713.55s]  It's okay. Sorry. She snuck around it
[9713.71s -> 9724.57s]  I don't go up again. I feel like she's going up again. I can I can see it in her eyes
[9725.37s -> 9730.03s]  You're just paranoid
[9730.03s -> 9733.55s]  Oh my god, you're making me scared and I don't think she's gonna do it again
[9740.49s -> 9743.29s]  Just do single hits right now like single jumps and back up
[9745.42s -> 9747.42s]  Until she shows her her true side
[9748.22s -> 9750.22s]  her fucking sicko mode
[9750.38s -> 9753.56s]  red-haired
[9753.56s -> 9756.04s]  Is she doing it? Nope. She's probably about to
[9760.72s -> 9762.72s]  Every time I jump in she jumps away
[9763.76s -> 9765.76s]  It's if it's happening. It's gonna happen very soon
[9767.60s -> 9769.60s]  Can't see what where'd she go?
[9769.76s -> 9772.75s]  This is between two pillars
[9781.08s -> 9783.08s]  Always keep a pillar between you and her
[9788.86s -> 9791.93s]  Here comes
[9791.93s -> 9794.49s]  I knew the moment I jumped on her that she was gonna do it
[9794.73s -> 9798.89s]  And I immediately started running and it was still too slow. Hey, let me cook for a minute
[9799.77s -> 9827.61s]  Okay, I thought it was I thought I could drink. I thought it was over. I thought the combo was over
[9831.58s -> 9833.52s]  my problem with milania is just
[9833.52s -> 9840.49s]  Knowing when you're just so scared of one of her moves that it's almost like a combo will happen and you'll go
[9840.57s -> 9845.05s]  Don't fucking do it. She's gonna do the water dance thing. Everyone is freak out and then it doesn't happen. But then it does
[9855.37s -> 9860.99s]  Undercooked learn to dodge that move. I know that this technically like a two frame window
[9861.47s -> 9863.47s]  to go like
[9867.55s -> 9872.03s]  I don't know it and it's gonna take a fucking a million years to figure to get that correct
[9873.28s -> 9876.16s]  You're supposed to dodge through it, but there's a window you can dodge through it
[9876.24s -> 9879.92s]  But if you want to dodge through it, you better have it right because you're gonna die if you miss even one frame
[9880.64s -> 9885.76s]  But chatter, how do we learn? How do we learn it? Do we do we fight the boss?
[9887.04s -> 9891.76s]  To learn that no, we have to go there's a training mode where you can just select any boss and oh
[9892.32s -> 9895.92s]  So we should close the game and open up the training mode. It's elden ring
[9896.72s -> 9898.40s]  training area
[9898.40s -> 9900.88s]  Okay, so we shouldn't fight the boss to learn it
[9902.48s -> 9905.96s]  Towershield is good. I think you can
[9907.00s -> 9914.24s]  Inhale it pretty much right?
[9914.24s -> 9916.30s]  I think the
[9916.30s -> 9921.56s]  and people were saying the same thing when I played the game for real in fought millennia and it's
[9922.51s -> 9926.67s]  You can dodge through but the thing about dodging through it is you'll dodge through it and then you don't know where she is
[9926.67s -> 9928.51s]  She's behind you somewhere
[9928.51s -> 9934.75s]  And it's like you have like one second to really figure out exactly how to dodge through that second and third attack because she goes
[9934.91s -> 9936.67s]  Away from your screen
[9936.67s -> 9938.67s]  So it's tricky. It's hard
[9939.77s -> 9941.53s]  It's very tricky
[9941.53s -> 9954.11s]  What do you mean?
[9954.11s -> 9960.11s]  Oh, come on really
[9960.11s -> 9964.19s]  That was really early and I was really hoping we'd get the stagger. So I used all my stamina
[9964.91s -> 9967.28s]  You want me to put anything in the oven here?
[9967.76s -> 9969.98s]  All right, probably not
[9969.98s -> 9972.38s]  And that's too to it too too immediate
[9974.92s -> 9977.16s]  All right, like I don't even care if I lose so maybe that means i'll win
[9982.48s -> 9986.48s]  He has nothing left to lose. I don't even like give a shit like who cares if I just lose right now. Yeah, I don't care
[9987.20s -> 9998.40s]  Can you please do the neelix voice? I have the boss scrumptious cake captain captain
[9998.80s -> 10010.01s]  Do you think we could have some scrumptious cake? There you go. All right, three two one
[10010.01s -> 10017.77s]  Are we leaving the area one more? I have the strap
[10019.68s -> 10022.48s]  You have a new strap. What is it? I have the new strap. Let's go
[10024.08s -> 10028.24s]  Can you tell me what the new strategy is? You just keep doing what you're doing and stop doubting
[10028.72s -> 10032.80s]  All right, but what is your so fill me in on what the strategy is so I can make sure I know to do no
[10033.60s -> 10036.68s]  No
[10036.68s -> 10038.68s]  As long as you do your best
[10039.68s -> 10040.88s]  honey
[10040.88s -> 10042.88s]  We're gonna do just fine. Okay
[10044.83s -> 10048.44s]  No help
[10048.44s -> 10052.94s]  Just do your best. So you but you are approaching this differently is what you're saying a little bit
[10054.22s -> 10058.38s]  What but what okay if there's a point in like phase two and there's three hits left and you're like
[10058.86s -> 10063.34s]  You need to do this do this do this and you didn't tell me what it was. No, you just need to do your best
[10064.16s -> 10066.32s]  I need you to focus. I need you to think right now
[10067.04s -> 10069.04s]  If we lose right now, uh-huh
[10069.60s -> 10071.04s]  We have to do it again
[10071.04s -> 10075.60s]  I want you to be like no i'm gonna be cautious and safe and just kind of like hit her here and there jump in
[10075.84s -> 10077.84s]  Well, make sure she doesn't go up
[10078.40s -> 10083.04s]  I mean stir. I am stir. I've been you've you've been the one you've been the one dying
[10083.60s -> 10085.60s]  But I've had to wait around you
[10086.16s -> 10089.12s]  Wouldn't it be better if like oh she's been waterfowling at me
[10089.20s -> 10092.40s]  You're just gonna say i'm the one dying because she's attacking you're not hiding behind
[10092.48s -> 10095.04s]  You're not using the pillars. Are you fucking shit?
[10100.36s -> 10102.36s]  I really hope this strategy is gonna work out for us
[10107.28s -> 10110.54s]  Are you serious?
[10110.54s -> 10111.98s]  Okay
[10111.98s -> 10117.07s]  One more how about this i'm gonna beat her right now
[10119.98s -> 10121.98s]  But see but you're not wait
[10122.62s -> 10138.41s]  You're not
[10138.41s -> 10140.41s]  You're not even using my strategy
[10165.29s -> 10167.29s]  Too focused to remember the pillar
[10167.29s -> 10172.17s]  No, I just wasn't in the right spot. And even if I ran behind the pillar, she probably would have gone around it
[10174.92s -> 10177.24s]  All right, so this is one for real I just I did
[10178.44s -> 10180.44s]  We're gonna be stuck here for like four hours
[10182.91s -> 10185.63s]  Stir you realize that we have like good weapons
[10186.27s -> 10187.23s]  but I
[10187.23s -> 10189.23s]  We are like potentially
[10190.00s -> 10191.36s]  like
[10191.36s -> 10194.72s]  Like 40 levels to like a 50 levels too low for her
[10195.52s -> 10197.48s]  You know that right?
[10197.48s -> 10198.36s]  Yes
[10198.36s -> 10204.92s]  So I I am aware that we shouldn't be insta dying the moment she touches us because we should just have like more health and stuff
[10205.40s -> 10207.40s]  It scales no should let us have this
[10209.61s -> 10211.61s]  It's scaled. It's scaled. No, no
[10211.69s -> 10214.41s]  Let us have this
[10214.41s -> 10219.29s]  How come the streamers can be fallible but the mod can't be and the scaling can't be a little off for milania
[10220.25s -> 10224.41s]  Copium overdose they messed up the code on milania. She's not scaled
[10226.09s -> 10232.25s]  Oh, I did hear about that. Yeah, and then it's in the patch notes. Yeah, it was like patch notes like uh, one point
[10232.97s -> 10235.29s]  uh, two point like uh three b
[10236.25s -> 10238.73s]  It was like having tons of trouble with with milania
[10238.81s -> 10243.93s]  It seems to be she's doubling her levels and the scaling doesn't work and she's doubling levels not scaling down
[10244.33s -> 10247.79s]  So it's like yeah. Yeah, I mean we're we're I mean if we beat this it's pretty good
[10247.87s -> 10249.87s]  And it's a little bit harder without the great run
[10251.55s -> 10254.83s]  Actually true though
[10254.83s -> 10259.07s]  That's the only thing that like the copium overload is like that's what you're saying is actually kind of true
[10259.63s -> 10268.92s]  This isn't a bad start. It's all right hold together
[10275.61s -> 10279.21s]  Don't you dare kill me? I will scream as loud as I can good. She's close
[10281.77s -> 10291.87s]  Keep your stamina
[10291.87s -> 10296.03s]  Nope. No, why did I why even attempt it? This opportunity is so small. All right. Yeah, be careful
[10296.83s -> 10307.10s]  It's coming
[10307.10s -> 10309.53s]  Keep a pillar between the two of you
[10309.53s -> 10315.48s]  I am here it is
[10315.72s -> 10321.16s]  Holy shit, are you fucking you're good? You're good. Hey, hey, you're fine. You're fine. It was only a little bit of hp taking off
[10321.24s -> 10323.24s]  You're fine. That was insane
[10331.77s -> 10349.23s]  Not a bad attempt if you could do it again, just be careful. Yeah, i'm i'm i'm envisioning it my game
[10349.79s -> 10351.93s]  a game like stuttered
[10351.93s -> 10353.93s]  I'm envisioning i'm envisioning
[10354.17s -> 10370.64s]  Please lock on to it. Okay. All right sicko mode. So just get out of the rot
[10373.79s -> 10377.39s]  Oh, it hit us both. It hit us both. Did it kill us both? It killed me
[10378.03s -> 10380.03s]  It scarlet rot at me. Oh
[10388.51s -> 10391.23s]  I was just wedged up against the fucking wall. I have no healing
[10394.40s -> 10397.77s]  Oh, that sucks
[10397.77s -> 10401.77s]  I thought we were in totally different spots, but then we kind of just ran together
[10402.33s -> 10406.25s]  Uh, it's weirder because like she would normally always go to the center of the room, right?
[10407.28s -> 10411.53s]  I know see the okay. Yeah, what happened there?
[10411.53s -> 10414.65s]  Because when she did it at first we were kind of confused and she went right in the middle
[10414.97s -> 10420.48s]  But she usually dives on top of you, right? I thought in the real fight. She always lands in the center
[10421.20s -> 10423.53s]  Wait, maybe i'm crazy. I think you are right
[10426.44s -> 10430.28s]  Doesn't it? Yeah, she lands in the middle. Why why did she jump on top of us? No, she dives you
[10430.92s -> 10434.06s]  Oh, yeah, she does
[10434.06s -> 10436.64s]  Okay
[10436.64s -> 10438.64s]  We are trying to get a pillar between her again
[10439.90s -> 10442.22s]  That's a good idea. I'm just trying to roll
[10445.66s -> 10449.50s]  You fucking hit ralphy. Well, I mean ralphy's completely in the way
[10451.88s -> 10462.67s]  Psycho
[10462.67s -> 10465.23s]  She dives on you but after the cutscene goes to the middle
[10479.31s -> 10480.83s]  All right, this let's
[10480.83s -> 10484.11s]  Actually last attempt because you know what's gonna happen. We're gonna we're gonna get to faith
[10485.07s -> 10490.08s]  We're gonna get to phase three
[10490.08s -> 10490.80s]  We're gonna get to faith
[10490.80s -> 10494.96s]  We're gonna get halfway through phase two and she has new moves in phase two that we're both gonna go
[10495.36s -> 10496.00s]  Oh, what is it?
[10496.00s -> 10501.44s]  What does that move and it's both gonna die to it and then we're gonna put our controllers in the air phase two
[10502.16s -> 10507.36s]  Easy. No, she does that weird ghost attack thing when she goes in the air and like 10 ghosts come out. Yeah
[10508.32s -> 10510.32s]  Yeah in here that's gonna be hell
[10510.80s -> 10513.28s]  But whatever well, it's all right. Those are excuses
[10540.84s -> 10543.08s]  Oh god, damn it. That's really unfortunate
[10543.96s -> 10553.21s]  Yeah, it is
[10553.21s -> 10555.21s]  I don't think we're gonna do it
[10557.90s -> 10559.90s]  Uh when I was first playing this boss
[10560.75s -> 10562.81s]  I remember thinking
[10562.81s -> 10566.73s]  I'm not gonna be able to do this and i'm gonna have to tell the stream that i'm just not doing it because I
[10566.73s -> 10569.77s]  Don't think I can I really didn't think it was possible for me to do it
[10572.75s -> 10577.23s]  I was trying to figure out like how am I gonna tell everybody that I can't do it and i'm like i'm just gonna give up
[10579.31s -> 10583.55s]  That was actually that was actually going through my mind for the last like two hours before I beat her
[10585.37s -> 10589.29s]  It's like, oh, how do I like say? Hey guys, like it's not fucking happening. It just isn't
[10590.01s -> 10617.07s]  third fucking time
[10618.03s -> 10622.27s]  Can stop doing this move stop doing this move, please
[10626.43s -> 10628.30s]  She wants it
[10628.30s -> 10630.30s]  It's the only move she has
[10631.07s -> 10655.64s]  All right
[10655.64s -> 10657.16s]  i'm just I
[10657.16s -> 10660.17s]  it
[10660.17s -> 10662.01s]  I hate this boss so much
[10662.01s -> 10667.45s]  Want to go fight bed of chaos?
[10667.45s -> 10673.60s]  I would rather like become roommates with the bed of chaos for five years
[10674.00s -> 10689.52s]  Then fight this piece of shit five more times. That one was really close though
[10693.74s -> 10699.34s]  This summon we could all right. This is the final attempt. This is the real last one. No more
[10700.54s -> 10702.70s]  No more fucking around before I before I like
[10703.58s -> 10709.40s]  Let's go somewhere else
[10709.40s -> 10714.68s]  We're going out to plateau right now. I'm just gonna teleport there without you. I'm just gonna go there without you. Okay. All right
[10715.56s -> 10717.80s]  Yeah, I I don't know. I have a lot of life
[10717.88s -> 10719.40s]  But every time she dives at me
[10719.40s -> 10725.56s]  I don't even have a chance to like dodge the second hit of uh, the waterfowl like it just fucking kills me
[10726.52s -> 10730.35s]  I don't know if because I have like no armor on or what my situation is
[10730.83s -> 10732.51s]  I'm just a dead boy
[10732.51s -> 10740.28s]  Like and i'm imagining a scenario where like the bed of chaos is like fucking dirty laundry is everywhere in the house and shit
[10741.08s -> 10743.16s]  And just like pots and pans go
[10743.78s -> 10746.68s]  Uncleaned after he cooks whatever fucked up shit that he cooks
[10748.67s -> 10755.64s]  Just constant issues really loud at like two three four o'clock in the morning. I don't even care. That's okay
[10756.28s -> 10773.61s]  I'm not fighting millennia again. Well, just decide where you want to go. Where do we we want to go to the okay?
[10775.07s -> 10777.56s]  if we go
[10777.56s -> 10778.60s]  Here
[10778.60s -> 10782.12s]  Right. No. No, we don't have to lift do we?
[10791.21s -> 10793.21s]  I'm fighting her right now. It's awful
[10795.26s -> 10797.71s]  one more time
[10797.71s -> 10799.71s]  No, no more times
[10804.52s -> 10808.60s]  No, there are no more times. All right, let's why am I always in combat here?
[10809.80s -> 10811.80s]  Where's the place to go to althus plateau?
[10813.77s -> 10815.37s]  We can come back. Uh
[10815.37s -> 10818.57s]  Well, what great rune bosses have we not done we were going to do ricard
[10819.37s -> 10824.92s]  Ricard is off the table as of right now. We did godfrey
[10827.20s -> 10828.94s]  then
[10828.94s -> 10831.79s]  I think we're done
[10831.79s -> 10833.79s]  Can we just like walk this way?
[10833.79s -> 10834.99s]  like here
[10834.99s -> 10839.85s]  Where that kind of burnt urn tree is that top where the bridge is can we we can get up there, right?
[10839.85s -> 10844.01s]  We can go to moag if we go to the uh, oh underground city
[10844.57s -> 10845.93s]  We could do underground
[10845.93s -> 10849.44s]  That sounds good to me. All right
[10850.09s -> 10853.36s]  Pull me back in let's go underground
[10853.36s -> 10855.36s]  Uh, what teleporter is that?
[10856.33s -> 10857.77s]  uh
[10857.77s -> 10860.41s]  We have a couple of them, but I don't know if that's the right ones we have to go
[10861.37s -> 10865.40s]  through
[10865.40s -> 10869.64s]  Yeah, I remember like the path to get down there when the ground is destroyed is really awkward. Yeah
[10873.64s -> 10875.64s]  underground sucks, you know
[10877.76s -> 10880.08s]  randomizer well
[10880.08s -> 10884.24s]  I'd rather go back to millennia when we have like a level 100 and I like all the stuff that we want
[10884.80s -> 10888.76s]  Not like it's gonna help
[10888.76s -> 10890.12s]  uh
[10890.12s -> 10892.12s]  I have opened my world to wanderers
[10892.52s -> 10900.22s]  Do we need to just go down to like the co for riverbank or there's a different way to get down to like actual
[10900.94s -> 10904.38s]  You have to go to the just come come to me come come to my world
[10904.94s -> 10914.33s]  sewer pipe
[10914.33s -> 10916.03s]  Yeah
[10916.03s -> 10934.49s]  Where all the omens are something like that. Okay, you guys are writing. All right following you
[10946.94s -> 10948.94s]  Why did it have to be millennia?
[10950.38s -> 10953.13s]  It could be any boss, you know
[10953.13s -> 10956.03s]  That one random room
[10956.03s -> 10958.03s]  Hey, it could be anything
[10958.03s -> 10960.03s]  So that means it could be millennia
[10960.96s -> 10966.48s]  I know but like I really wanted to see if like we have to use the spear on whoever replaces right card
[10967.28s -> 10969.28s]  I think we could do it eventually
[10969.36s -> 10970.96s]  We just gotta like
[10970.96s -> 10972.78s]  We just gotta go for it
[10972.78s -> 10983.10s]  It doesn't I don't know. It depends when she's looking at me, but it doesn't feel great to do on a caster
[10984.99s -> 10986.99s]  Yeah, that's also hard. It's a
[10987.39s -> 10989.39s]  slow
[10989.39s -> 10992.51s]  If one of us was like a dex user, I feel like that fight's easier
[10993.23s -> 10999.00s]  Everyone's gonna write omega lol dex in chat, but it's all right
[11004.70s -> 11006.70s]  Yeah, oh we had to jump down on the other side
[11007.34s -> 11013.55s]  I think I don't know this I remember like in my first playthrough just walking around this area for like an hour being like, huh?
[11019.98s -> 11021.98s]  Yeah, you gotta go like down
[11022.38s -> 11046.49s]  There are a couple things to do down here. I almost just didn't make that
[11048.72s -> 11051.05s]  with a double jump
[11051.05s -> 11057.47s]  I I spell
[11057.47s -> 11059.47s]  It's cool ancient city of wonder
[11060.35s -> 11062.35s]  What could lie millennia?
[11064.60s -> 11066.60s]  Is it possible for duplicates? It's not right
[11067.32s -> 11087.20s]  I don't think that's where millennia is that's where millennia will stay. Okay, that's all right then a little bit of a fall joke
[11088.00s -> 11092.22s]  See my issue is i'm like rushing
[11092.78s -> 11094.94s]  I like I still feel like millennia is behind us
[11095.90s -> 11098.91s]  And i'm at the fucking volcano manor
[11101.84s -> 11105.12s]  Uh, I could probably just go grab the bonfire and vote
[11108.84s -> 11111.48s]  So I remember not getting a bonfire for a while down here
[11113.16s -> 11115.64s]  I can't really leave because I would port you out
[11118.36s -> 11119.64s]  Okay
[11119.64s -> 11122.84s]  Just chill for a second. Take a breather millennia is not behind you
[11134.56s -> 11141.29s]  Wait a minute. She's behind you
[11141.29s -> 11154.83s]  I don't know somebody is believe that somebody is behind me. You're just playing vr in your game
[11155.87s -> 11161.31s]  guys come come to my stream if you want to see his perspective like of just him in vr and like the actual inside the
[11161.31s -> 11165.71s]  Helmet view is um, I mean I I can banish you and you can just join me again
[11166.59s -> 11168.59s]  And then you'd be with me. That's probably easier
[11172.76s -> 11175.32s]  You know, I I like items down here. I can just I can just do it
[11177.93s -> 11179.93s]  You keep playing let's get up
[11191.63s -> 11195.07s]  Okay, i'm going to try to join you again
[11200.65s -> 11209.58s]  If I walked off
[11209.58s -> 11214.36s]  I got michaela's needle
[11214.36s -> 11217.88s]  Looks like I beat her
[11217.88s -> 11222.24s]  Cool. All right. So
[11222.24s -> 11224.96s]  What are the actual bosses that are down here? There's another one of those
[11225.92s -> 11231.36s]  the mimic spirits, right and the big no cron dragon man and
[11233.16s -> 11240.22s]  Mog if you get really far down is down here, right? I think we need a certain item or something for mog mog
[11242.62s -> 11246.28s]  Like yeah, I don't know if we can actually do
[11247.80s -> 11255.42s]  There is a mog like down here though. I'm just gonna walk out of this room
[11257.77s -> 11289.79s]  Okay, glen stone stars. Do you want it? No, there's like crucible knights down here. Usually
[11292.54s -> 11297.80s]  There are but it's randomized. So I doubt we'll see them. But yeah right down this hill is the mimic
[11298.52s -> 11307.63s]  Tear I don't know what boss would be in here. Uh, that's like the first enemies we've killed in like three hours
[11311.29s -> 11312.81s]  Uh, hey
[11312.81s -> 11315.77s]  millennia is always gonna just make a like
[11316.65s -> 11330.27s]  Six hour gap on any stream where somebody's playing it. This is the way it is. You're not gonna even get the item
[11330.75s -> 11332.32s]  I mean
[11332.32s -> 11336.24s]  It looks like a dumb lame item shattering crystal. Do you want it?
[11337.12s -> 11338.80s]  somber eight
[11338.80s -> 11340.80s]  And the mantis blade
[11340.80s -> 11344.12s]  I think the only spells I really want are like the beam ones
[11344.60s -> 11349.16s]  That's hurt a lot
[11349.16s -> 11353.64s]  Well, these guys are empowered by
[11353.72s -> 11354.60s]  Mog
[11354.60s -> 11361.84s]  What sort am I using? I'm using the magma worm sword
[11364.64s -> 11367.28s]  I'm using it's called the magma worms scale sword
[11371.93s -> 11373.93s]  All right
[11375.13s -> 11379.50s]  Runoc
[11379.50s -> 11382.70s]  I do wonder what we're gonna do about acquiring great runes
[11386.19s -> 11389.71s]  Didn't you say that there's a thing with this randomizer where oh
[11390.27s -> 11393.23s]  If you want to find this specific item you can or something
[11393.55s -> 11398.51s]  Yeah, there's like a cheat sheet notepad where you can look up where stuff is and I think also the merchants sell
[11399.47s -> 11403.21s]  Uh hints
[11403.21s -> 11405.21s]  You go. I'm scared
[11405.37s -> 11411.24s]  As long as it's not a dragon or millennia. It's just a misbegotten. We're good
[11420.19s -> 11422.19s]  It's a mimic misbegotten
[11431.24s -> 11441.58s]  Yikes
[11441.58s -> 11443.58s]  That's so much easier than millennia
[11445.40s -> 11447.29s]  Memory stone
[11447.29s -> 11452.22s]  I I am still I don't know what it is. I'm getting golden seeds from every boss. It's good
[11452.86s -> 11478.62s]  Do I have any not really I feel like it's time for a change of clothing. Oh, there's also the
[11480.01s -> 11481.92s]  The deer
[11481.92s -> 11484.00s]  Yes, if we light all of the thingies
[11485.66s -> 11488.86s]  Which uh, I know kind of a tired statement. I never did it
[11489.66s -> 11492.97s]  I did the first year and then I came down in this area and I was like
[11493.61s -> 11498.73s]  Getting shot by people who had bows you oh you didn't do this one. This one has I moved on with my life
[11499.37s -> 11510.51s]  The deer boss is really actually pretty cool
[11512.20s -> 11515.08s]  I enjoyed fighting the deer bosses. I think they were fun
[11523.28s -> 11525.68s]  Damn, that was a triple item drop
[11527.98s -> 11529.98s]  I didn't mean to do that. I thought it was an enemy
[11530.38s -> 11532.22s]  I was living jaw
[11532.22s -> 11554.67s]  Okay. So do you want to fight the um, yeah, whatever's here? Yeah light that flame
[11556.04s -> 11558.28s]  There is four twenty. I think there are six, right?
[11560.16s -> 11562.16s]  Oh 20 wait you
[11562.72s -> 11565.92s]  Are you hey you 420 you like 420?
[11566.56s -> 11572.04s]  No, i'm relating
[11572.04s -> 11574.80s]  420. All right
[11574.80s -> 11576.72s]  All right 420
[11576.72s -> 11578.72s]  Now just if you do
[11579.26s -> 11582.32s]  Recreational marijuana and it's legal in your state or wherever you are
[11583.44s -> 11588.00s]  Cool in moderation. Be careful. Don't do too much. It's not like just
[11588.96s -> 11594.41s]  Just treat it like anything else that you know, any more too much of a good thing too much of anything is bad
[11600.32s -> 11602.32s]  Shut up, dad. No, i'm serious
[11602.72s -> 11606.80s]  I'm serious be serious about it. They say even too many oreos
[11608.70s -> 11610.97s]  Yeah, it's true
[11610.97s -> 11612.97s]  Uh, you just have to touch them, right?
[11613.77s -> 11623.68s]  Yeah
[11623.68s -> 11626.62s]  That looks really weird
[11626.70s -> 11628.70s]  Elgin lord braces
[11632.40s -> 11636.24s]  Oh, wait, isn't there like a mini boss over here too inside this little area?
[11638.36s -> 11640.36s]  I think it's just an item
[11641.55s -> 11649.32s]  It's just an item but it's like we'll go get it jar. I think it's a it's a chest
[11651.39s -> 11653.07s]  If you go up all the way
[11653.07s -> 11654.27s]  Yeah
[11654.27s -> 11657.39s]  It is a chest but there is an opportunity for something cool to be in the chest
[11658.11s -> 11663.53s]  I really don't also an opportunity to like jump off this map. I don't want to be the one to do that
[11663.53s -> 11667.21s]  So i'm gonna be careful
[11667.21s -> 11674.44s]  I am the one that would do that
[11674.44s -> 11676.20s]  Watch out. It's being guarded
[11676.20s -> 11682.22s]  by the fucking gruesome slob
[11683.58s -> 11685.61s]  death root
[11685.61s -> 11687.61s]  You really are taking your time
[11690.33s -> 11691.93s]  My controller unplugged
[11691.93s -> 11695.53s]  It's control the vibe was off my controller unplugged
[11696.62s -> 11722.67s]  Look, can you not get out of here without teleporting?
[11723.56s -> 11731.04s]  You actually might not be able to get out of there. Yeah, I don't think you can
[11732.81s -> 11735.66s]  Do you want to just pour it?
[11735.66s -> 11737.66s]  Yeah, hold on. Let me turn this one on
[11738.14s -> 11745.10s]  I can do it too, right? Yeah
[11749.84s -> 11752.40s]  Uh, if you if you pour it, I will say yes
[11753.20s -> 11757.26s]  I already voted
[11757.26s -> 11759.26s]  You did i'm in common combat
[11760.06s -> 11766.14s]  I mean, hold this. Let me just get this one
[11766.54s -> 11782.22s]  Oh, no, you can get out. I'm good. Are you good?
[11783.04s -> 11783.84s]  Yeah
[11783.84s -> 11788.64s]  Oh, you did get out
[11788.64s -> 11791.44s]  We need what two more? I got one just now
[11792.16s -> 11793.96s]  I think there is
[11793.96s -> 11797.80s]  one or two more
[11797.80s -> 11800.76s]  Looks like anything happened to let you know, you got them all
[11802.03s -> 11804.99s]  I don't remember probably
[11808.27s -> 11810.91s]  I don't think so
[11810.91s -> 11812.91s]  We need let's see
[11815.28s -> 11817.28s]  We get this one. We got that one
[11818.51s -> 11820.03s]  I think we got them all
[11820.03s -> 11822.03s]  Unless there's one more somewhere
[11822.35s -> 11828.40s]  Did we get them all?
[11828.40s -> 11829.90s]  Oh god
[11829.90s -> 11831.58s]  That seriously killed me
[11831.58s -> 11834.22s]  There is one there's one more
[11840.40s -> 11842.16s]  one remains
[11842.16s -> 11851.37s]  What's my favorite pasta shape? Um, probably penne
[11853.44s -> 11854.72s]  or spaghetti
[11854.72s -> 11861.66s]  I'm getting where this last one is
[11861.66s -> 11870.72s]  I feel like it's deep
[11870.72s -> 11872.40s]  I got it. Yeah
[11872.40s -> 11875.28s]  It's a good thing I died. I never would have came back here
[11875.76s -> 11882.54s]  Our gathers. Oh, yeah. There we go. I have a debuff
[11883.88s -> 11886.12s]  Uh, do you want to just sit at the barn fire? No
[11887.76s -> 11889.76s]  We're doing this boss hard mode
[11890.30s -> 11892.30s]  We don't even know what it is. What if it's hard?
[11892.96s -> 11894.80s]  It's gonna be super easy boss
[11894.80s -> 11898.24s]  We've had like a really rough start to the stream just like last time where we decided to like
[11899.04s -> 11901.04s]  Run our heads into placid u6
[11901.28s -> 11904.03s]  And we ran our heads into malania
[11904.41s -> 11909.13s]  And jumping off a cliff, you know what I mean? Okay. Well give them a minute to uh vote
[11909.77s -> 11914.04s]  Never mind. Whoops. I goofed it. Oh no
[11914.76s -> 11920.75s]  I still don't have to go in. Yeah, let's see. Do you think we'll beat this first try?
[11921.39s -> 11925.36s]  Uh, this is gonna be the putrid clown
[11927.34s -> 11930.38s]  The putrid clown putrid clown juggler
[11940.30s -> 11942.46s]  All right. It looks like a lot of people think yes
[11943.10s -> 11948.88s]  A lot of people are saying yes
[11948.88s -> 11950.88s]  What they don't understand is behind this door
[11951.60s -> 11956.00s]  Is hold on if it if it's like rodon the stream is just gonna end it might probably enough
[11956.56s -> 11960.72s]  All right, let's go
[11960.80s -> 11962.97s]  Uh
[11965.69s -> 11969.08s]  No
[11969.08s -> 11970.12s]  well
[11970.12s -> 11975.80s]  There's a lot of mini bosses there. I gotta say for us to find like all of the end game bosses
[11983.91s -> 11986.33s]  Thankfully, it's in an area that makes sense
[11987.13s -> 11990.67s]  for this fight
[11990.67s -> 11992.75s]  Where are the beams? Don't they come down?
[11993.63s -> 11995.63s]  They should maybe they hit the ceiling
[12005.07s -> 12006.83s]  I forget this whole fight
[12006.83s -> 12007.79s]  Same
[12007.79s -> 12009.79s]  I haven't gotten next to it yet
[12014.86s -> 12016.62s]  Oh my goodness
[12016.62s -> 12022.81s]  Yeah, this first try easy
[12022.81s -> 12024.01s]  Hit it
[12024.01s -> 12030.72s]  And then it's gone
[12030.72s -> 12037.79s]  Eat shit
[12037.79s -> 12039.79s]  All that fucking hurts
[12039.87s -> 12051.15s]  Oh god
[12051.15s -> 12053.82s]  It's not going well
[12053.82s -> 12056.30s]  It's not going that badly either though
[12057.26s -> 12061.04s]  I don't have a lot of flash right now
[12068.14s -> 12075.82s]  I think it's just a game of patience
[12075.82s -> 12077.02s]  Where am I?
[12077.02s -> 12079.45s]  He's doing triangle mode
[12079.85s -> 12083.50s]  I think what is triangle mode? Oh, you have to jump over it, right?
[12085.34s -> 12088.14s]  Oh my god. Okay. Well I baby
[12089.87s -> 12092.83s]  I baby no, I said I maybe I don't know
[12093.63s -> 12097.15s]  I think we're okay, man. I think we're just we're thinking way too deeply here
[12102.81s -> 12105.21s]  It looked like he was swinging at you. Um, he is now
[12109.34s -> 12115.68s]  I have one flask remaining
[12115.76s -> 12120.40s]  I I so wish this was an arena where we could use a fucking horse. I didn't dodge that
[12120.56s -> 12122.56s]  But I did look like I did
[12124.04s -> 12126.04s]  He's just running
[12146.72s -> 12148.72s]  I think we're all right. Just play it safe
[12166.86s -> 12169.50s]  Oh this fucking move
[12169.50s -> 12171.50s]  It's it's on you
[12171.96s -> 12174.92s]  What the hell? Oh, that's this thing
[12176.20s -> 12179.16s]  Stop yelling. What is it making make it a youtube video or what?
[12179.88s -> 12184.68s]  It'd be a sick video if you were
[12187.36s -> 12189.36s]  Uh-oh, he's doing triangle mode
[12189.90s -> 12191.26s]  or circle
[12191.26s -> 12196.28s]  man
[12196.28s -> 12199.93s]  Get out
[12199.93s -> 12202.14s]  Okay, he nuked me
[12202.14s -> 12248.64s]  Stay alive
[12248.64s -> 12251.13s]  Wow believers
[12251.13s -> 12254.41s]  Hey, congratulations for the fucking millions of points. You probably just got
[12258.20s -> 12260.20s]  I got great rune of the unborn
[12260.75s -> 12265.77s]  I got a stone sword key and a bell bearing and the glint stone wet blade
[12266.49s -> 12270.11s]  And a bell bearing we sure i've got a few bell bearings. I don't know what's in them
[12271.55s -> 12278.06s]  We should go check
[12282.52s -> 12284.68s]  I'll be really honest though. We lucked out big time
[12285.48s -> 12287.53s]  because
[12287.53s -> 12290.73s]  If you put the elden beast in a room that's small like that millennia room
[12290.89s -> 12296.89s]  I don't think I we probably wouldn't to fight him in a small room. No, I don't think you know, you're not no
[12297.69s -> 12303.21s]  I would all those moves are so they're just aoe spam moves that we wouldn't you wouldn't be able to do it
[12303.69s -> 12308.73s]  Well, I would love to like for the experience to see what that fight's like if you're not constantly running across a football field
[12312.25s -> 12316.49s]  Like how are they gonna let him run that far and not give me a fucking sniper rifle in this game?
[12316.89s -> 12318.89s]  Yeah
[12321.21s -> 12337.93s]  So we did that
[12337.93s -> 12343.05s]  What else is down here? There's uh, then you drop down here and you go to uh, oh where the double gargoyles are
[12343.13s -> 12345.12s]  Yeah, we might get some
[12345.12s -> 12347.12s]  That's gonna be fun. Whatever. That is
[12353.71s -> 12357.79s]  Rip 15k imagine all the emotes with glasses I could have had with that much money
[12361.39s -> 12362.67s]  that's so
[12362.67s -> 12365.15s]  uh, that was
[12365.15s -> 12371.85s]  Emotes with the glasses I have no channel point shit like really at all. It's emos with glasses
[12372.89s -> 12374.89s]  I mean there aren't a lot of options
[12375.45s -> 12382.62s]  Some people have millions of points here and it's like, uh, it's like you 100 put glasses on the germamoon emote
[12384.03s -> 12395.48s]  Nice. There's a guy behind you
[12395.72s -> 12397.72s]  Oh watch out. It's you. Oh, it's you
[12414.33s -> 12420.41s]  Crab look at all those glasses
[12423.02s -> 12425.02s]  So many glasses emotes
[12428.64s -> 12430.64s]  What does the glint stone wet blade even let me do
[12432.32s -> 12437.04s]  I believe it lets you imbue weapons with the magic damage ash of war stuff
[12438.48s -> 12439.68s]  Oh, yeah
[12439.68s -> 12440.88s]  but it
[12440.88s -> 12443.05s]  So you can scale off of intelligence
[12443.05s -> 12444.81s]  With pretty much any weapon
[12444.81s -> 12448.25s]  I was I was thinking because I already do that but i'm using glint stone pebble to do it
[12451.02s -> 12453.74s]  There's another somber ancient stone. I've gotten a lot of
[12454.54s -> 12457.74s]  Bell bearings it really might be worth after we do this to go check what's there
[12463.87s -> 12465.87s]  Oh, there's a legendary over here
[12467.02s -> 12469.02s]  Legendary legendary legendary legendary
[12474.32s -> 12481.08s]  Lord of blobs bro
[12481.08s -> 12489.79s]  Where is it? Oh, I got mogs
[12491.60s -> 12499.47s]  Bro, I have the twin darmer set for this apparently
[12507.93s -> 12509.93s]  I got a I got a pose
[12510.01s -> 12523.74s]  Okay, nice. Who is that? Uh, that is the other that's the twin brother. Oh, this is bad
[12524.76s -> 12526.76s]  I don't think we need the spear
[12526.76s -> 12529.40s]  but but also we could be wrong and
[12530.28s -> 12534.00s]  Just die
[12534.00s -> 12538.08s]  Um, okay. There we go. We got the spear. We have the spear apparently
[12538.64s -> 12540.64s]  Where is it? I hate when this happens
[12542.32s -> 12545.92s]  Where is it? I hate when this happens. There it is coming slow. Don't panic
[12547.53s -> 12551.21s]  All right, we can I think we can do this the technique where he never attacks you
[12551.85s -> 12554.25s]  We don't have the oh you have to weapon art
[12557.10s -> 12560.06s]  If you can stun them, you can keep them stunned forever. I think wait
[12560.70s -> 12561.58s]  I
[12561.58s -> 12563.18s]  Am confused
[12563.18s -> 12565.82s]  What do you mean? How do you how do you do this shit again left trigger?
[12567.32s -> 12569.32s]  Yeah, mine doesn't have a wind blade
[12570.35s -> 12572.97s]  Only you can do it my chat saying
[12577.40s -> 12581.00s]  I saw so many speed runs this part that I know you can literally just keep them in like a loop
[12581.08s -> 12582.84s]  You really wanted to
[12582.84s -> 12584.84s]  Well, it's not worth it. I can't help
[12584.84s -> 12604.09s]  Does this thing cost mana or no?
[12604.09s -> 12606.09s]  Oh, they patched it. Okay
[12606.25s -> 12607.71s]  It's good to know
[12607.71s -> 12612.76s]  Oh, did they find like something that was fun?
[12613.08s -> 12616.60s]  And then they like patched it out. You need mana to do this shit. God damn it
[12618.06s -> 12619.26s]  I'm helping
[12619.26s -> 12630.48s]  I'm overweight with this
[12630.48s -> 12639.12s]  I wish I could see
[12639.12s -> 12655.50s]  I got him
[12655.50s -> 12657.50s]  Frater Raikhan
[12658.86s -> 12661.50s]  All you do is eat the gods and then you
[12662.70s -> 12668.97s]  I have no more mana
[12668.97s -> 12672.01s]  Uh, I guess I could just attack like this
[12672.73s -> 12676.64s]  Please don't die. It's only you
[12676.72s -> 12679.53s]  I'm not gonna who said I was gonna die
[12680.46s -> 12682.46s]  I'm just worried because I can't help
[12683.18s -> 12685.34s]  No phase two. No phase two. No phase two
[12686.72s -> 12688.72s]  No phase two. Don't do it
[12696.19s -> 12699.32s]  Yeah
[12704.97s -> 12707.29s]  These quotes are approximately correct
[12708.25s -> 12712.64s]  It's like you told an ai to do the the ryckhardt lines
[12714.12s -> 12728.38s]  Okay, good fight
[12728.46s -> 12732.52s]  I have to level up
[12732.52s -> 12735.72s]  Yeah, so so the next elden we're gonna do elden ring two
[12736.52s -> 12738.04s]  dark souls four
[12738.04s -> 12741.00s]  And uh, there's totally gonna be like a sword that shoots like wind
[12741.88s -> 12744.44s]  There's gonna be one boss
[12744.44s -> 12746.94s]  I have a question for you. Then there's gonna be a swamp
[12747.66s -> 12751.02s]  I I want I want the actual stir take because I don't know if this is just stupid or not
[12751.02s -> 12753.02s]  But I was thinking about this
[12753.02s -> 12755.45s]  Do you because eric look?
[12755.45s -> 12757.45s]  Everybody loves the from software
[12758.55s -> 12763.61s]  RPGs like this, right? We're not talking about any of the other games they've ever made not like armored core. Whatever this
[12764.41s -> 12768.01s]  Lower left of your screen that looks like this in like five of their games
[12768.49s -> 12774.81s]  Everybody loves these with the stamina bar and the you know dodging and the pairing they call they call them souls. So sure
[12775.93s -> 12778.49s]  Yeah, do you think it would be cool?
[12779.61s -> 12784.25s]  It they kind of just and look i'm not complaining. I love these games. They're amazing
[12785.29s -> 12790.57s]  But like each one of these games is like the same kind of game in a different setting with some slightly different changes, right?
[12791.61s -> 12793.90s]  Yeah
[12793.90s -> 12797.26s]  Would you pay like 15 bucks a month for a?
[12797.74s -> 12800.86s]  Souls like mmo where they just kept fucking adding stuff to it
[12802.40s -> 12804.40s]  They're making them anyway
[12805.56s -> 12808.17s]  god forged
[12808.17s -> 12814.65s]  But made by from software not like oh something in this world. No, I mean like the next whatever they do is just like, you know what?
[12815.45s -> 12820.17s]  We keep making this type of game and everybody loves it. So let's just like have one go forever
[12822.35s -> 12824.03s]  I mean, honestly
[12824.03s -> 12826.03s]  That's what neo feels like
[12826.27s -> 12830.59s]  It would just not with the emma like the actual online I would love the actual online
[12831.80s -> 12833.26s]  but
[12833.26s -> 12837.02s]  but comes with a big but that this would be being made by like
[12837.88s -> 12839.92s]  a japanese company
[12839.92s -> 12844.88s]  And it would have a whole bunch of like gacha mobile. Well mmo i'm using that term wrong
[12845.20s -> 12847.92s]  Not an mmo, but just like a like a constant
[12848.72s -> 12852.88s]  Like they make dark souls one dark souls two dark souls three they make bloodborne. They make elden ring
[12853.20s -> 12855.20s]  You're just saying live service dark souls
[12855.52s -> 12858.24s]  Yes, and it's just like that. It's just you don't have to worry about it
[12858.24s -> 12860.08s]  Oh, when's the next dlc like it's just gonna happen
[12860.08s -> 12862.88s]  It's gonna be like a wow patch like every like four or five like three or four months
[12865.60s -> 12872.19s]  I think on paper that sounds great. That's what I mean, but I think it would actually be fucking awful
[12872.27s -> 12874.43s]  Yeah in practice this it would be probably terrible
[12874.51s -> 12878.64s]  But I don't know. I just feel like I I I love these games
[12878.88s -> 12883.68s]  I feel like they wouldn't be able to execute that without completely killing the vibe of like hey for halloween
[12883.68s -> 12886.08s]  We got the new update to souls 14
[12886.40s -> 12892.32s]  That's right guys are gonna get like oh wear pumpkin hats and like there's like just like all the weird themed cosmetics
[12892.40s -> 12895.84s]  Everyone be running around. I didn't think of like fucking bizarro. Yeah
[12897.52s -> 12899.68s]  I didn't think of the it's christmas time
[12899.92s -> 12904.32s]  You dress up as a tree and transform using your talisman into a fucking present
[12904.48s -> 12913.07s]  I forgot about the the octoberfest update that would happen. Yeah. Yeah
[12913.63s -> 12915.05s]  Yeah
[12915.05s -> 12919.69s]  but I mean like in theory if that if like without the pessimism of it being bad because
[12920.01s -> 12922.97s]  I feel like there's a two percent chance. It makes it through like all of like
[12924.17s -> 12929.45s]  The business dealings for them to get like the money grant to be able to do some live service multi-year thing
[12930.01s -> 12933.53s]  Well, hold on get through all that and it's not many dlcs to dark souls 2 have
[12934.17s -> 12936.72s]  Well, it was a bunch wasn't it like four
[12938.56s -> 12940.57s]  uh
[12940.57s -> 12942.17s]  two three
[12942.43s -> 12946.99s]  Two or three. Yeah, so there were three dlcs for dark souls 2 and people always go. Oh man
[12947.15s -> 12951.87s]  It's awesome that isn't one of the things you say that one of the reasons why you like dark souls 2 so much more
[12952.27s -> 12954.19s]  Than the other ones is why?
[12954.19s -> 12958.03s]  How much content how much content there is why elden ring is pretty great
[12958.43s -> 12962.91s]  But isn't that kind of that that doesn't like I think you might get what you're saying
[12963.55s -> 12969.55s]  Within a couple years of like elden ring was like crazy financial successful raised a bunch of eyebrows
[12970.03s -> 12974.91s]  People are like, oh souls games people have been playing for like 10 years time to like come in and ruin it
[12977.32s -> 12983.48s]  Yeah, somebody made a good franchise long enough like we're getting dangerously close to like man. I miss the old from soft
[12983.64s -> 12988.84s]  I don't want it to happen. That's true. And I hate like if i'm jinxing it my bad, but like
[12989.40s -> 12993.24s]  These are the good we're in the good times and you gotta appreciate somebody said
[12993.24s -> 12997.48s]  It's actually kind of a good point is like art is finite
[12997.64s -> 13002.80s]  Should be kind of in this world and I think if you don't let a game like this be finite
[13003.36s -> 13009.12s]  Then you maybe are going down the road where it just ruins everything and where are we going?
[13012.48s -> 13018.44s]  How do we end up at the end of a ledge? How do we end up here? I don't get across somehow
[13022.60s -> 13027.80s]  I agree on that like everyone got to play through the same thing at the same time and get excited about the same stuff
[13028.04s -> 13028.92s]  Yeah
[13028.92s -> 13031.56s]  And at the moment that it does become like mmo
[13031.80s -> 13037.88s]  Everyone's like what's the quickest way to end game because I just want to like grind millennia for millennia's god-sent set
[13038.59s -> 13043.66s]  Yeah, that's true
[13043.66s -> 13045.00s]  Yeah
[13045.00s -> 13050.28s]  I think it's just like it's a it's such a good thing and it's such a it's such a unique experience that it's almost
[13050.86s -> 13055.64s]  You sit there and go god damn it. I wish I could have that unique experience again, but it's here
[13055.72s -> 13061.12s]  It already exists. You already had it. Fuck fuck dude
[13061.36s -> 13071.23s]  I'm just excited to see them explore like different settings again and see how armored core turns out
[13075.95s -> 13078.35s]  I never played any of the armored cores with any were they fun?
[13078.99s -> 13080.99s]  Well, what kind of I don't know what kind of games they are
[13081.15s -> 13085.71s]  I believe we had this conversation and yeah, I love like armored core one and two were amazing
[13085.87s -> 13087.87s]  I went to go get an item and I got
[13088.72s -> 13095.48s]  Annihilating fortunate. I'm awesome. I mean like I just thought like we're all doing it. Everyone's doing it
[13096.30s -> 13098.30s]  I'll just drop 60k souls real quick
[13105.40s -> 13112.14s]  Yeah armored core games are really good. I think they got like early on it was like slower more dark souls like slow big mechs
[13112.54s -> 13115.18s]  If you put on a whole bunch of armor your mech would like be slower
[13115.66s -> 13118.46s]  And it started to get towards like three four five
[13118.62s -> 13123.12s]  It got a lot more anime and I didn't really play those and i'm kind of hoping
[13123.90s -> 13127.87s]  And assuming it's going to be a little bit more like the older ones. Yeah
[13131.08s -> 13137.64s]  Uh, yeah, you uh because lightning coming from I did the mario thing
[13137.72s -> 13143.08s]  Where you jump like you freak out even though you make the jump you still jump a second time third time because you just don't
[13143.24s -> 13148.86s]  You thought you were gonna miss the edge. Is that three fall jokes today? Is it a little bit played out?
[13148.86s -> 13155.40s]  You think well, I mean you did miss that jump in the lava place like 40 or 50 times
[13155.40s -> 13169.74s]  So I think I can fall a few times. Ooh, whirl of flame
[13185.05s -> 13186.33s]  Okay
[13186.33s -> 13187.53s]  Okay
[13187.53s -> 13189.77s]  At like e3 comes around it's like june
[13190.33s -> 13195.21s]  And there's like a dark souls or like a bloodborne announcement like bloodborne moon rising
[13195.93s -> 13199.69s]  And like holy shit that like it's just like a cinematic trailer looks amazing
[13199.77s -> 13203.69s]  Looks so and at the end when it says like what consoles and everything it's on it's like, okay
[13203.69s -> 13209.77s]  This was made by nexon. How are you feeling after that?
[13210.33s -> 13217.61s]  I don't know about that
[13217.61s -> 13221.37s]  Well, I think I think that goes back to what you were asking. Yeah
[13223.79s -> 13228.78s]  I think
[13231.36s -> 13233.36s]  Yeah, I don't know about that
[13242.30s -> 13245.98s]  What if I told you that this game was ass and there's nothing you could do to convince me. Otherwise
[13246.70s -> 13251.34s]  I would tip my hat to you and say good day. Good, sir. We have different opinions. Um,
[13251.98s -> 13253.82s]  Enjoy the rest of your evening
[13253.82s -> 13257.28s]  I got the magma whip candlestick
[13262.01s -> 13264.16s]  I think uh
[13264.16s -> 13268.72s]  When someone says you can't change my mind about this. Yeah, that's like that. Oh that i'm not going
[13268.96s -> 13270.48s]  I'm not gonna try
[13270.48s -> 13274.88s]  You really expect me to do anything else other than not talk to you anymore. Yeah, it's like hold on a minute here
[13275.52s -> 13277.52s]  Listen to me. Let's talk about this
[13278.16s -> 13281.84s]  You've already you've already given me no opportunity to uh to give you an argument
[13285.74s -> 13287.74s]  I would just say yeah. All right
[13289.37s -> 13292.06s]  I have have a good day
[13296.72s -> 13297.92s]  It's like hey
[13297.92s -> 13299.52s]  Hey jeremy
[13299.52s -> 13302.08s]  Pizza is disgusting. I think it's fucking gross
[13302.72s -> 13305.44s]  What do you say about that? Do you think you think you're gonna convince me to eat pizza?
[13306.49s -> 13308.49s]  No, that's more pizza for me
[13308.73s -> 13314.01s]  Can't convince you though something you already don't want or don't like
[13314.83s -> 13317.23s]  You already um, you've already made up your mind
[13317.95s -> 13319.95s]  And it's almost like you want me
[13320.03s -> 13324.67s]  To argue with you so you can argue your points back to me
[13325.47s -> 13330.83s]  But why you think i'm wrong you're trying this is a your wrong scenario and I want to prove why
[13332.30s -> 13333.50s]  Sorry
[13333.50s -> 13335.50s]  I'm not gonna give that opportunity to you
[13336.54s -> 13341.50s]  We can go over to the tree that's over there because there's usually a crucible knight and item or we just go up to uh
[13342.38s -> 13345.42s]  giant dead mermaid
[13345.42s -> 13349.52s]  You make the call mermaid
[13355.40s -> 13358.68s]  Which I this is not how you get there. I I don't think it is
[13361.68s -> 13366.08s]  I know this is a really really stupid question to ask but you definitely didn't do like the secret boss
[13366.08s -> 13368.08s]  That's up here when you fight. Um
[13368.40s -> 13370.96s]  the deathbed companion all of her champions
[13372.22s -> 13376.46s]  No, I did that you did that's actually surprising. That's not really a secret
[13376.54s -> 13379.50s]  I mean that's like you have to do a very specific amount bunch of shit in a row to do that
[13380.14s -> 13383.42s]  I don't think so. You don't I don't have to do her whole quest line
[13383.90s -> 13385.90s]  Um, I thought you just show up
[13386.14s -> 13388.14s]  Oh, I thought you had to do her whole quest line
[13388.97s -> 13390.97s]  Coke zero or diet coke neither
[13391.37s -> 13401.24s]  I don't like either one of them
[13401.24s -> 13404.52s]  Just give me a smaller regular coke so I can so all right
[13405.16s -> 13407.16s]  I would rather drink less
[13407.64s -> 13410.84s]  Regular coke than more coke that doesn't taste that good
[13413.08s -> 13417.56s]  Just I want to drink less of the if sugar and all that and calories or whatever is what you're concerned about
[13417.88s -> 13421.48s]  I would just I would just I don't I don't want to drink like a full 12 ounce can
[13422.73s -> 13425.68s]  If you get a two liter just have a little bit
[13425.68s -> 13430.76s]  I'd rather have the full flavored one but less of it. I really don't like I know a lot of people
[13431.16s -> 13433.16s]  Love the way the diet coke tastes
[13434.03s -> 13439.71s]  It tastes like flavored air in your mouth after and people go. Yeah, that's the point. That's why I like it
[13440.27s -> 13442.43s]  It's like okay
[13442.43s -> 13446.43s]  And i'm telling you right now you are not going to convince me otherwise that diet coke is good
[13449.12s -> 13453.42s]  Go on. Come on
[13453.42s -> 13455.18s]  I mean, I I don't
[13455.18s -> 13460.38s]  I don't have a stake in this
[13460.38s -> 13463.37s]  Uh, where did you where are you? Did you go up?

[13466.65s -> 13469.79s]  Did you just seriously spoil my?
[13470.27s -> 13472.27s]  It's fucking boss here
[13472.43s -> 13478.84s]  I mean you're talking about drinking air. I
[13480.30s -> 13485.24s]  Wandering around it's because coke diet coke when you take a sip out of it
[13485.64s -> 13487.88s]  It kind of disappears in your mouth and leaves this
[13488.60s -> 13492.52s]  It leaves this weird like air flavored flavored like sugar air
[13493.93s -> 13496.17s]  You don't know what i'm saying people the people that get it get it
[13498.06s -> 13502.22s]  Magicians actually use it when you take a sip of diet coke. It goes like
[13503.44s -> 13505.44s]  And it's this and it's this weird like
[13506.40s -> 13509.52s]  Like someone breathing in your mouth. I'm telling you it's
[13511.74s -> 13514.62s]  Why do I have so I just got so many
[13514.62s -> 13517.34s]  Shit keeps falling off the trees. I just yeah, what the fuck?

[13570.84s -> 13572.20s]  Yeah, I mean it
[13572.20s -> 13573.64s]  I could believe that
[13573.72s -> 13579.72s]  Considering that in the last like two weeks load monster hunter rise came out on game pass. You can just download it
[13580.86s -> 13582.52s]  On top of that

[13594.68s -> 13604.67s]  It actually is mog. You're right
[13606.65s -> 13608.81s]  Um, so do you want to fight him solo?
[13610.60s -> 13612.28s]  You want to fight him solo?
[13612.28s -> 13615.48s]  Well, no you because he's like your favorite and you're you're like wearing his outfit

[13641.96s -> 13643.96s]  Is he gonna like count down and
[13644.46s -> 13646.46s]  He's probably gonna do the thing
[13646.46s -> 13653.74s]  Sorry, just be aware of it
[13653.74s -> 13657.42s]  I forget how that works and if we need an item for him to not
[13658.06s -> 13661.02s]  Murder us. It's a flask item, but you can heal through it
[13692.11s -> 13693.15s]  Oh
[13693.15s -> 13698.25s]  You got me with a backswing. I'm doing a challenge run where I have to get hit by every attack
[13699.61s -> 13701.77s]  I was gonna say I've heard you scream like a lot
[13716.36s -> 13720.91s]  Fucking die
[13720.91s -> 13723.07s]  Oh, that was quicker than I thought it was gonna be
[13739.96s -> 13744.78s]  He's gonna do his thing and we need to heal through it. I got one flash
[13745.50s -> 13747.74s]  Maybe he doesn't do it because
[13747.74s -> 13749.74s]  He should have he should be doing it now
[13750.16s -> 13756.56s]  Wait, this might be the other mug the fake mug. Yeah, it's the fake mug a different mug like no

[13767.13s -> 13769.13s]  I don't um
[13769.21s -> 13771.53s]  Just beat the boss already
[13771.53s -> 13778.36s]  Hey, remember when you made that joke about me fighting the boss alone

[13815.42s -> 13817.29s]  What's your drip?
[13817.29s -> 13821.13s]  This is what you needed all the question for afterwards. You talked to her to do plastic do six
[13822.17s -> 13824.25s]  But the initial fight I think is uh always here
[13825.50s -> 13826.38s]  um
[13826.38s -> 13832.46s]  What do we say? That's right
[13835.88s -> 13838.04s]  To be a mother so it is I must bear
[13840.36s -> 13842.94s]  Bottom one
[13842.94s -> 13844.94s]  Oh, I think I just ruined it
[13845.96s -> 13847.96s]  Because we uh, i'm disbanding
[13849.39s -> 13850.27s]  Oh
[13850.27s -> 13857.13s]  I want to spend uh
[13857.13s -> 13859.21s]  Quick amount of time. I am gonna do the respect
[13864.14s -> 13868.35s]  Am I okay?
[13868.35s -> 13873.55s]  I can still choose. Okay. Good. Wait, you you let her hold you. No, that's you're supposed to so then that's how you fight
[13873.55s -> 13879.07s]  Plastic do you think you sick fuck? That's how you fight plastic do six you fucking horn dog

[13896.32s -> 13901.85s]  Horoloo chieftain of the badlands and who could forget
[13913.48s -> 13916.84s]  The all-knowing
[13916.84s -> 13928.49s]  It puts me in combat every time. I can't leave this area. It's annoying. Can I take one of these things to like go back?
[13929.29s -> 13935.16s]  That's not good
[13935.16s -> 13936.20s]  even
[13936.20s -> 13947.58s]  How do I get out of here?
[13947.58s -> 13953.55s]  I can't
[13953.55s -> 13957.95s]  I don't want to run through all this. I know I just whatever but what if I miss i'm gonna
[13958.75s -> 13965.72s]  I'm okay. I can make it
[13966.40s -> 13971.47s]  Why am I alive?
[13971.47s -> 13975.47s]  I don't know, but doesn't kill you instantly. How come it was killing us instantly?
[13976.19s -> 13991.44s]  What the fuck? Wait, what the that was weird?
[13997.00s -> 14000.52s]  Like we already did this. My brown hole is invaded again
[14001.40s -> 14003.40s]  It might just keep doing that
[14003.96s -> 14005.32s]  maybe
[14005.32s -> 14007.32s]  They died in three hits this time
[14007.77s -> 14009.77s]  Wow a hundred souls, thanks

[14013.48s -> 14018.60s]  Bells your bell bearings. Oh good idea. I want to just teleport out of here
[14025.40s -> 14027.79s]  Did I go the wrong way?
[14027.79s -> 14031.15s]  I mean, i'm just trying to get far enough away from where I was to teleport
[14032.11s -> 14036.03s]  Golden order seal boost fundamentalist incantations. Do you remember what those are?
[14038.32s -> 14040.72s]  What counts as fundamentalist? I think
[14041.68s -> 14044.72s]  some of the big fire spells count
[14047.60s -> 14057.69s]  Is the the black flame stuff I think the holy light one. Oh, it's lightning. Okay. Do you have any seals?
[14057.69s -> 14060.57s]  I only have a golden order and dragon communion
[14061.29s -> 14062.89s]  I
[14062.89s -> 14064.89s]  Do have some seals
[14064.89s -> 14071.61s]  I have dragon communion and I gave you the other one. Whatever it was. Yeah, that's the golden order
[14072.01s -> 14080.09s]  I guess i'll use that one
[14080.09s -> 14088.94s]  Okay, just really get the hell out of here. It's not open in my goddamn game
[14089.74s -> 14107.90s]  What do I do now?
[14107.90s -> 14110.14s]  You went the wrong way rest go down the ladder
[14115.39s -> 14117.39s]  I just want to pull the fuck out of here
[14118.86s -> 14119.82s]  uh
[14119.82s -> 14122.19s]  Go into the castle
[14122.19s -> 14125.47s]  Read chat i'm staring at you right now. It's just read
[14126.19s -> 14131.71s]  Chat read chat is is there are there are 5 000 messages, which one?
[14133.02s -> 14133.98s]  read
[14133.98s -> 14135.98s]  Chat i'm just gonna go this way
[14136.94s -> 14152.17s]  I'm gonna die in
[14152.17s -> 14155.21s]  I'm just running around in circles until I figure out where the hell i'm supposed to go
[14158.97s -> 14161.13s]  That's a bunch of garbage my bell bearings are all
[14164.40s -> 14165.92s]  Ball lakes
[14165.92s -> 14170.56s]  I think I can go through here
[14170.56s -> 14181.13s]  Can I go through here?
[14181.13s -> 14183.85s]  What are you doing right now? How does he not remember doing this multiple times?
[14184.25s -> 14188.33s]  Um, because this area is fucking enormous and there's so many random ass places to go
[14188.97s -> 14192.57s]  That and they all look pretty identical. So they're all the same place in my brain
[14194.88s -> 14197.44s]  Where are you trying to go? I'm just trying to get to any grace
[14198.16s -> 14200.16s]  But I can't go anywhere
[14200.48s -> 14204.88s]  Oh, you're trying to get a closer you're trying to millennia right now. I'm trying to get the hell out of this area
[14205.68s -> 14208.96s]  But it won't let me
[14208.96s -> 14213.04s]  Uh, then inside the building to the left and you go down the stairs. That's where I was thinking of going
[14213.04s -> 14215.04s]  But there's somebody scary there
[14215.04s -> 14217.44s]  Uh, that's fine. That's where we were spawning earlier with the bird in the way
[14219.23s -> 14221.87s]  That's what I just didn't want to get blocked by that
[14226.65s -> 14228.89s]  and then down the stairs here, right
[14230.81s -> 14236.41s]  My uh finger reader receive equipment of champions she's got ash of war kick
[14237.96s -> 14244.91s]  Wow, this guy's just gonna fuck it all up for me. I know it's gonna chase me
[14260.19s -> 14263.45s]  Okay kick is op
[14270.84s -> 14273.16s]  Is kick I mean kick is actually pretty good
[14277.88s -> 14279.82s]  Yeah
[14279.82s -> 14283.93s]  Is it?
[14283.93s -> 14286.41s]  Bro, am I even going the right direction?
[14288.78s -> 14295.13s]  Yep, that bird wasn't even there before when was that bird here?
[14296.24s -> 14299.37s]  Lightning isn't faith scaling. Yes, it is
[14312.56s -> 14315.68s]  Wait non lightning is dex
[14316.96s -> 14318.22s]  Yeah
[14318.22s -> 14320.22s]  I got lightning ram and it's dex
[14322.51s -> 14326.35s]  I don't have the only thing i've been missing is I don't have a single faith ash of war
[14327.07s -> 14330.20s]  I wish I could drop them because I think I have two or three of them
[14332.81s -> 14335.63s]  I don't think I have the uh
[14335.63s -> 14337.63s]  The thing to make them faith
[14339.42s -> 14341.66s]  Oh the actual doors are open now
[14354.70s -> 14356.70s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
[14356.70s -> 14360.30s]  The dragon communion seal scales on arcane, right?
[14361.85s -> 14364.27s]  I could do that
[14364.27s -> 14366.59s]  Wait, I could put it on a weapon and drop it really
[14370.81s -> 14372.81s]  That's kind of cool. I didn't know that
[14374.88s -> 14375.92s]  Okay
[14375.92s -> 14377.28s]  Let me see
[14377.28s -> 14385.47s]  I have um sacred blade
[14386.20s -> 14388.36s]  And I think I can put it on a weapon and just give it to you
[14388.84s -> 14397.60s]  That's actually a good idea if I gave you my long sword. Yeah, and I could just put it on and just give it back
[14399.95s -> 14405.33s]  I'm thinking uh, because I have actually a whole bunch of stuff that scales with a cult. I could use the dragon communion
[14407.31s -> 14409.77s]  um
[14409.77s -> 14411.77s]  But does that scale just as good as the other?
[14413.60s -> 14415.45s]  um
[14415.45s -> 14417.34s]  seals
[14417.34s -> 14418.70s]  I think
[14418.70s -> 14420.70s]  the dragon seal scales
[14421.10s -> 14422.78s]  He said with arcane
[14422.78s -> 14429.34s]  But it also just can be used as a seal for every other spell. I think it just depends on what the spell is
[14429.82s -> 14433.79s]  Yeah, I just want to make sure i'm not like screwing myself in some obscure way
[14434.27s -> 14438.83s]  I don't i'm gonna i'm gonna do arcane. I should have another larval tier i'm just gonna go arcane
[14439.15s -> 14442.99s]  Which is also good because that's a magic vine for items and it's all random
[14443.07s -> 14447.47s]  So maybe we get more better stuff dragon communion scales to s with arcane at level 10
[14447.71s -> 14455.28s]  Apparently, is there any other fun stuff that I want to use? Maybe i'll be like a
[14456.00s -> 14459.44s]  Maybe i'll do the bubble thing. That's kind of fun. Then that's the play
[14459.92s -> 14469.92s]  Do you guys want me to level up? Uh the big bubble horn? Uh, do you have a smithing stone?
[14470.56s -> 14472.22s]  somber five
[14472.22s -> 14479.82s]  I probably do let's see what i'm missing. I have a somber stone five
[14483.53s -> 14486.17s]  Do you have a nine is there a nine or does it go straight to dragon?
[14486.25s -> 14490.49s]  There is a nine and I also have a nine as well. Okay, I need a five and a nine
[14491.34s -> 14494.84s]  I can give you both of those. Okay, then i'm gonna go
[14496.76s -> 14514.54s]  Respec again, I guess oh the bearings. Yeah, I do check your bearing shop if you haven't yeah, I did
[14514.70s -> 14522.06s]  When does she go sit? Oh, you have to get her. Yeah, her shop will be randomized too. Won't it?
[14522.76s -> 14532.57s]  Doesn't does she have a shop? I think she sells some random shit doesn't she finger lady?
[14533.66s -> 14551.44s]  Oh, the finger lady does have a shop not just remembrances. Ooh
[14556.14s -> 14560.96s]  This thing is pretty cool
[14560.96s -> 14577.61s]  This is like fire. It's like a blood fire colossal hammer sharpened
[14578.01s -> 14585.82s]  Yeah, volcano fragment. I mean, it's 1800 i'm gonna buy it
[14593.79s -> 14596.43s]  Weapon rewards will be randomized if you bring the remembrances to her
[14597.79s -> 14607.95s]  Worth looking. Okay. Cool. Now you can finally play as me strong good point
[14609.55s -> 14617.68s]  very good point
[14617.68s -> 14622.89s]  Wisdom of the two fingers have you then I've been I am known as a tarnished eye onto us
[14629.39s -> 14633.15s]  We're a stir. We're in separate worlds just getting our shit together
[14636.17s -> 14640.81s]  Yeah, I gotta I gotta pick up my order. Do you I don't know. I can't drop this. I don't think
[14641.95s -> 14646.99s]  The litany of proper death creates an image of order to deal. Holy damage
[14654.70s -> 14656.70s]  Holy shit. I have so many
[14657.18s -> 14659.18s]  I have so many bearings
[14661.00s -> 14663.16s]  Holy shit. All right, we're gonna be here for a little while
[14665.96s -> 14673.40s]  Um god, can you try joining my world because i'm like bottlenecked until I get that and i'm already in the round table
[14674.20s -> 14675.80s]  Just a moment
[14675.80s -> 14680.03s]  Uh, oh you're in the right. Can I join you? You should be able to
[14697.16s -> 14700.24s]  love so you need a
[14700.88s -> 14703.23s]  nine
[14703.23s -> 14705.23s]  end of five
[14705.55s -> 14710.04s]  There you go. What the heck is braggart's roar?
[14720.20s -> 14725.00s]  Why is your door closed but mine is open? I don't know. That's weird
[14725.56s -> 14728.52s]  Oh, wait, let's see the dung eater. What are you dressed like?
[14740.28s -> 14743.56s]  All right, let's go over all this new shit that I have
[14744.36s -> 14755.68s]  the death root
[14755.68s -> 14757.68s]  Hi, I have it
[14757.68s -> 14762.67s]  Okay
[14762.67s -> 14764.19s]  Now we need
[14764.19s -> 14765.39s]  No, no, no
[14765.39s -> 14767.39s]  Do you have any faith talismans?
[14768.76s -> 14771.16s]  faith talismans like the stuff that boosts
[14772.35s -> 14774.91s]  Faith magic or anything weird like that that you're not using
[14777.52s -> 14779.52s]  Oh, let me find out
[14785.96s -> 14786.92s]  I have
[14786.92s -> 14790.20s]  Uh raises maximum fp raises decks
[14794.51s -> 14797.31s]  I don't think I have anything that boosts faith
[14799.90s -> 14807.31s]  I don't you can only see your other bell bearing shops because you used them in your solo game
[14808.54s -> 14810.54s]  Oh shit. Well, i'm leaving for a minute
[14812.73s -> 14815.74s]  You got the items, right?
[14815.74s -> 14818.56s]  Yeah, good
[14818.56s -> 14832.51s]  Oh shit, we're duping
[14832.51s -> 14839.02s]  golden land

[14840.70s -> 14843.92s]  I got rot breath with a plus 10 dragon seal
[14844.80s -> 14856.46s]  See how millennia likes it already used this one before
[14859.94s -> 14861.94s]  Eight thousand come on
[14881.34s -> 14883.34s]  Is that all the bell bearings I had
[14883.34s -> 14888.91s]  I feel like i've seen all this stuff already
[14899.13s -> 14904.75s]  by the soul
[14904.75s -> 14905.71s]  Hmm
[14905.71s -> 14918.78s]  I don't think I really want anything. I think i'm ready. I think i'm done. I need a you know
[14918.86s -> 14920.86s]  Like a new outfit to like impress you
[14923.20s -> 14927.07s]  I never will no matter how cute I look
[14935.84s -> 14977.44s]  Get the millennia sword
[14977.68s -> 14980.56s]  Where's the millennia's weapon? Oh this thing, right?
[14982.16s -> 14988.80s]  Oh 48 decks i'm never gonna do that. Yeah
[14993.15s -> 14993.95s]  i'm
[14993.95s -> 14998.35s]  Pretty much ready, but I am gonna do this because people are gonna be mad if I don't use this weapon
[14998.67s -> 15007.04s]  Okay, I need to get it ready. I did give you the stones. I gave you the stones and I really needed them
[15007.98s -> 15011.29s]  Um, well, I gave you stones earlier. So it's only fair
[15028.11s -> 15030.11s]  You want to be fair right there
[15031.63s -> 15037.79s]  All right. I'm ready. I'm gonna join. No, I probably shouldn't join you here. This has problems
[15039.10s -> 15044.22s]  Yeah, where are we going? Well
[15046.17s -> 15050.33s]  We could go we did this. Do you want to go do the um
[15051.53s -> 15052.41s]  we're
[15052.41s -> 15055.29s]  Placidusix is supposed to be that other dragon
[15057.24s -> 15062.92s]  Uh, do we have that quest on that quest? I don't know what we're supposed to do. Can we actually do it?
[15063.95s -> 15083.71s]  I doubt it of four to sex, right? Can we do four to sex? You gotta have the item
[15084.27s -> 15086.59s]  Now you need the finger slayer blade
[15088.33s -> 15092.33s]  We could go we could go give some death root really we both have a few that we haven't given
[15093.21s -> 15094.89s]  I have a great rune
[15094.89s -> 15097.28s]  So i'd like to go somewhere where we can activate it
[15097.84s -> 15101.93s]  one of the towers, um, which one is it the
[15102.89s -> 15107.44s]  Unborn
[15107.44s -> 15113.20s]  That I have the finger slayer blade you do. Ooh. All right. Well, then let's go back and do the fiaquest
[15113.60s -> 15123.92s]  So we need you to go. Let's just go do it, which is which teleport?
[15124.32s -> 15131.98s]  Uh the roots it's where we would just were right before we left that root place
[15135.50s -> 15137.90s]  Now you have to give the finger slayer blade to ronnie
[15139.90s -> 15140.54s]  Oh
[15140.54s -> 15148.70s]  Uh, that's right. So go to ronnie. You don't need the blade. I need the curse
[15148.94s -> 15160.16s]  Yeah, hopefully if you get it then I can play too need death mark. Not the blade. The blade is for ronnie
[15164.01s -> 15171.76s]  Ronnie is just like jealous
[15171.76s -> 15174.12s]  All right. Let's go
[15175.74s -> 15177.00s]  to
[15177.00s -> 15184.48s]  Ninth mount gelmere campsite and we're going to go back and we're going to run into altis plateau
[15186.51s -> 15188.33s]  Are you okay with that?
[15188.33s -> 15190.33s]  Uh, I need one second
[15199.98s -> 15203.34s]  Yeah, every quest is going to be a huge pain just because everything's just so everything's randomized
[15203.42s -> 15210.73s]  We might just we might just get stuck somewhere and have to turn around you get the death mark from killing millennia
[15211.29s -> 15215.63s]  But it'll be random every if we kill millennia. She'll give us like fucking dung
[15223.36s -> 15230.56s]  I am I am doing some nasty shit with fear right now. Um, are you ready to play the game?
[15233.60s -> 15237.36s]  I saw somebody in chat said hey dude, like i've been sitting here for like five ten straight minutes
[15237.76s -> 15242.56s]  I've got a big bunch of snacks. I got popcorn. I have like nachos and cheetos and shit
[15242.96s -> 15244.72s]  And I my popcorn is getting cold
[15244.72s -> 15247.84s]  I haven't been able to take one bite because I was waiting for you guys to start to do something
[15248.84s -> 15252.64s]  They're furious
[15252.64s -> 15256.72s]  He said he said he's holding it in like big like holding it all like popcorn
[15256.80s -> 15268.04s]  How come how come you got to be embraced by fia and I don't how is that any bit fair?
[15277.18s -> 15281.37s]  Okay, where where were we meeting? I was just seeing if I had an item the uh
[15282.09s -> 15286.09s]  Where are we meeting like where are we going? Like what what's happening? Like who are you aldous plateau?
[15286.65s -> 15292.35s]  So we're gonna go to the nine nine mount gilmer campsite and then from there we're gonna run to
[15292.91s -> 15306.08s]  Aldous plateau. Okay. Um, I believe my world is so we are going to this way. We want to go this way five
[15306.64s -> 15310.51s]  Three join my world now
[15321.76s -> 15334.14s]  Dude, I need to poop and I i'm not gonna read the rest of that. But okay. Oh you look different. What did you do?
[15335.28s -> 15341.87s]  All right, it's a race to get there go

[15350.41s -> 15356.40s]  20 bucks thousand dollars. I don't know where we're going
[15357.26s -> 15361.15s]  Uh, we're just following
[15361.15s -> 15363.63s]  First person to get there also follow me not that way
[15382.38s -> 15388.72s]  Weird like this is not where millennia is
[15389.28s -> 15393.32s]  No, it's not
[15393.32s -> 15394.60s]  another point
[15394.60s -> 15401.16s]  Okay, you know we never did we ever fight the way that um, like the meteorite
[15401.72s -> 15404.36s]  Demon thing was we didn't go all the way up there. Did we?
[15405.00s -> 15409.00s]  No, we didn't what was up there the tree spirit. Oh, this is tree spirit. That's right

[15580.92s -> 15588.32s]  Uh, how do you get down to the where mog is I thought you did that from no crone you
[15591.13s -> 15594.97s]  It's like a teleport from somewhere. I think oh from the
[15595.77s -> 15597.37s]  the four ways
[15597.37s -> 15601.55s]  Teleporters or it's yeah the the place with the blue keys
[15603.24s -> 15605.24s]  blue stone sword keys
[15606.28s -> 15609.26s]  Good theory
[15609.26s -> 15610.73s]  Okay
[15610.73s -> 15612.19s]  uh
[15612.19s -> 15617.82s]  Let's let's explore
[15617.82s -> 15619.82s]  Probably something interesting down here
[15619.82s -> 15631.84s]  Actually pretty useful
[15631.84s -> 15634.00s]  Is there ruins that go down here?
[15636.30s -> 15642.94s]  crab crab crab watch out crab. I see it
[15644.30s -> 15646.06s]  There is over by me
[15646.06s -> 15649.90s]  It's probably a bad idea to just walk up there with the horse
[15651.90s -> 15653.90s]  That's one of these guys. It's a mog like
[15657.29s -> 15665.23s]  I don't know. Is that thing bigger than normal?
[15665.87s -> 15677.34s]  But this thing is just right in front of me how
[15684.86s -> 15690.70s]  Why did I just hear is that a dragon? That's me. I'm dragon boy. I did no damage with that
[15694.11s -> 15696.11s]  Which is kind of surprising
[15696.73s -> 15698.49s]  Just lagging my game
[15698.49s -> 15702.51s]  All right, just come down here. Oh
[15703.50s -> 15705.28s]  Wait, no
[15705.28s -> 15706.64s]  Yeah, that's sad

[15714.81s -> 15716.81s]  Oh you went downstairs
[15718.09s -> 15719.90s]  There is a boss
[15719.90s -> 15721.90s]  All right, something easy
[15722.06s -> 15727.95s]  Something simple you first
[15727.95s -> 15730.36s]  Who is this?
[15730.36s -> 15734.28s]  Oh, it's one of the invader like the bell-bearing invaders
[15735.16s -> 15737.24s]  Oh, no, no. No, this is somebody this person's in that castle
[15760.27s -> 15766.35s]  Now I don't like being in this corner
[15767.56s -> 15768.50s]  game
[15768.50s -> 15773.82s]  Lacky whenever boss
[15773.82s -> 15777.28s]  true
[15777.28s -> 15778.40s]  true
[15778.40s -> 15780.84s]  oh

[15790.16s -> 15791.50s]  No item
[15791.50s -> 15818.11s]  Out of this door. Oh poison bloom crap. Okay, we continue to progress
[15825.88s -> 15828.20s]  All right. I think we get invaded here by
[15829.29s -> 15830.78s]  Margaret
[15830.78s -> 15832.78s]  That's way later
[15832.78s -> 15838.14s]  Up in the castle is it I thought it was like right here. Look all that castle all the way up on the right past the urn tree
[15838.70s -> 15841.42s]  Yeah, you go there. Yeah, and that's where margaret is
[15844.92s -> 15846.92s]  Oh, let's kill these. Let's do it
[15847.16s -> 15849.48s]  I'm i'm initiating the pact of let's do it
[15853.95s -> 15857.31s]  I turn around just being killed by a dog
[15858.03s -> 15862.24s]  Well, you know what they say
[15862.24s -> 15865.63s]  Why are we killing these?
[15865.71s -> 15867.31s]  Because they got the item
[15867.31s -> 15870.11s]  Yeah, we can just go in the back
[15870.11s -> 15873.08s]  No
[15873.08s -> 15874.76s]  This dog's gonna kill me
[15874.76s -> 15900.17s]  It's a random group of fucking enemies
[15902.56s -> 15904.24s]  That's a big ant
[15904.24s -> 15910.19s]  It's a crazy big shield. It's holding
[15912.44s -> 15917.88s]  Yeah, you were on crack in the very beginning of this stream. By the way, i've mellowed out a bit, but I really

[16005.82s -> 16009.15s]  I never I don't really happen that often though
[16010.91s -> 16012.91s]  They're incredibly hard to make
[16015.12s -> 16018.32s]  It takes a lot because you need to be like a professional chef
[16019.28s -> 16022.56s]  Um, i'm kind of you lagged out and I don't know where you are

[16082.19s -> 16085.47s]  Cheese on my no. Okay. No, that's a good answer

[16095.98s -> 16101.96s]  And I don't agree
[16102.04s -> 16105.00s]  No, i've never had cheese on one. I feel like it's enough on its own
[16105.95s -> 16108.32s]  Yeah, i'm glad we agree
[16110.75s -> 16114.01s]  and the boss is

[16475.96s -> 16479.24s]  I thought it was that didn't look that far that looked fine
[16480.12s -> 16483.39s]  All right. Anyways, what were you saying?
[16484.11s -> 16485.15s]  I
[16485.15s -> 16489.82s]  I don't got nothing to say
[16489.82s -> 16493.90s]  All right, you can tell him do it as a warning. I the short version of the story is
[16494.86s -> 16499.82s]  Me and ashley went to the grocery store yesterday to get food like a whole bunch of like the prepared grocery store meals
[16500.06s -> 16504.54s]  Okay, I was like, i'm i'm lazy. I just want like a whole bunch of these to eat. Okay, you mean for me
[16504.94s -> 16508.22s]  But when you say prepare it you mean it's like, okay, there's like a salmon in here
[16508.22s -> 16511.18s]  It's already seasoned and howard he has the stuff in it. You just put it in the oven
[16511.42s -> 16517.74s]  It's just like a cold cuts a pork chop with like some potatoes and green beans like ready to go in the oven. Yes
[16518.14s -> 16524.54s]  Yeah, nothing wrong with that. Yeah, and we walk we don't drive so it's like all in a backpack so we could walk back with it
[16525.18s -> 16527.72s]  and uh, you know just
[16527.72s -> 16530.20s]  I went to go eat them. I was like excited like oh shit
[16530.20s -> 16532.52s]  I've got so much food and I went to go get and there was uh, you know
[16532.52s -> 16534.52s]  It was all still in the backpack
[16535.24s -> 16538.60s]  Like the next day so you just had a bunch of fucking food
[16539.32s -> 16541.40s]  Oh, that's one you ate one
[16542.75s -> 16550.11s]  Stirrer, I ate one stir. You ate a backpack meal. That was like raw food in a backpack. Yeah
[16552.17s -> 16555.93s]  24 hours had gone by I you're saying it like I didn't cook it first
[16556.01s -> 16561.16s]  I did cook it and it wasn't it was maybe I don't know it was overnight like 16 hours
[16562.28s -> 16565.08s]  I think you're missing a lot of the finer points here. I don't know dude
[16565.24s -> 16568.52s]  Have you ever watched one of those food time lapse videos?
[16570.33s -> 16575.29s]  Where it shows like one hour two hour five hour six hour and then they fucking ants to start coming in and grubs
[16575.61s -> 16579.13s]  Well, it is sealed inside of a thing. There's like not ants getting in it
[16582.97s -> 16587.29s]  What kind of food was so you took so this was uh, so you opened up the backpack and you were like
[16587.69s -> 16590.97s]  Oh like oh like you must have stunk
[16591.69s -> 16599.20s]  It honestly didn't and then I unsealed the wrap on it and I touched the meat and it was like a little cold
[16599.44s -> 16606.76s]  And I was like, hmm like it was colder than my my hand was you know, it felt a little cooler touch
[16606.92s -> 16610.92s]  So then you were just like, you know what fuck it i'm just gonna put this in the oven like if I die
[16613.34s -> 16615.95s]  I die and how long ago was this?
[16617.66s -> 16624.52s]  Is overnight like got it at like 8 pm at night and then it was the next day at like 2 pm. Okay
[16625.90s -> 16627.90s]  So, how do you feel right now?
[16629.88s -> 16636.24s]  Uh, I ate it yesterday. Uh, I gotta say I felt a little weird, but i'm good. You feel a little weird now
[16638.00s -> 16645.04s]  Um, I think i'm good. Are you coming like i'm at the castle i'm sorry
[16645.20s -> 16650.14s]  I'm can't tell you that i've been paying that much attention to the game when I heard that you ate food
[16650.22s -> 16652.22s]  That's been in a backpack for a fucking day
[16652.70s -> 16654.52s]  It looks fine
[16654.52s -> 16659.08s]  No, the fucking bear grills is like eating his own shit. No, no, no, no
[16659.24s -> 16663.64s]  I'm telling you right now you're I know you're about to go down this path of oh, what are you talking about?
[16663.64s -> 16665.64s]  Like you probably would no
[16666.04s -> 16672.60s]  No, I would not if if I had like a pork chop that was raw that was on the counter for 16 hours
[16673.08s -> 16675.21s]  I would not eat it
[16675.21s -> 16679.93s]  But there's like no other food because that's all the food you got for yourself. I would figure something. I would figure something out
[16681.26s -> 16688.65s]  Yeah, I would something out. I would eat anything else anything else. No, that's not happening
[16691.34s -> 16694.22s]  Especially if it's like raw food that's just sitting there
[16695.29s -> 16698.73s]  What is the the this of the what's the time? It's two hours, right?
[16699.13s -> 16705.24s]  Two hours is like when bacteria really starts to grab a hold of food, right when it's out a bit of bacteria is good for you
[16705.80s -> 16708.68s]  It's four. Okay, so four hours went by
[16710.46s -> 16715.42s]  Okay. Well, hopefully you don't have any issues. All right. I don't know where the fuck i'm going right now
[16718.68s -> 16726.70s]  Stuart can we teleport back to the windmill village and can you help me this fucker's judging my fucking backpack?
[16727.61s -> 16734.11s]  Raw meat meal doesn't even know where he's going. I gotta say though. Actually, I was kind of dizzy yesterday
[16734.35s -> 16739.39s]  Bridges didn't exist for thousands of years in human history. Yes, but they were curing their meats
[16740.19s -> 16742.19s]  It's not the same. It's not it was
[16743.61s -> 16751.05s]  That's stirs fucking musty ass backpack is not a curing environment for for food
[16751.96s -> 16755.00s]  That's not okay. I ain't gonna have that happen
[16760.80s -> 16765.52s]  Do you want to I mean you'll be proud of me at the very least that there was coconut shrimp in there. Ooh
[16766.89s -> 16769.37s]  Everything we talk. Yeah, you're absolved of all these crimes
[16769.85s -> 16774.57s]  Okay, well I was just gonna say I didn't eat the coconut shrimp actually was like that's fish and I was like a good argument
[16774.57s -> 16776.57s]  Good point. Oh, yeah, don't eat that
[16776.89s -> 16783.18s]  But somehow eat what was what was the food the actual food you ate the actual food was pork chops and potatoes
[16783.18s -> 16785.18s]  That's just that's just as bad
[16785.34s -> 16791.12s]  It's not fish raw pork is arguably probably I would even say maybe even potentially worse
[16794.88s -> 16796.88s]  Fucking it was like eight bucks, dude
[16801.55s -> 16803.55s]  Fucking for real right now
[16803.63s -> 16805.23s]  Uh-oh, look out
[16805.23s -> 16810.00s]  They don't even shoot raw fish is sushi though
[16810.40s -> 16815.92s]  Well raw fish is sushi, but it's not sushi. That's been sitting on the restaurant table for 16 hours
[16817.87s -> 16820.19s]  Yeah, we left the sushi out overnight in our backpack
[16822.03s -> 16824.03s]  Fucking disgusting
[16827.52s -> 16832.48s]  Honestly, what do they do to sushi? No, but hey, hey, please people are telling me that I have this wrong
[16832.80s -> 16837.68s]  We're not talking about a tv dinner. We're talking about it's it was raw food that you had to put in the oven and cook it
[16838.08s -> 16840.08s]  Yeah, it was just like raw pork chop
[16840.24s -> 16843.52s]  See, it's it's not like a tv dinner. It's not like stoffers
[16847.02s -> 16852.30s]  Just like in them in like an aluminum tray with like uh plastic wrap around it pork chop
[16854.44s -> 16855.24s]  I
[16855.24s -> 16857.24s]  I actually can't believe you ate that
[16858.30s -> 16861.76s]  Honestly same though
[16861.76s -> 16866.24s]  So what was the scenario? You're just like, you know what? I don't care what happens to me
[16866.40s -> 16871.52s]  I'm just gonna eat thinking about it for like a day and I like had no other food and I looked at them all
[16871.60s -> 16874.72s]  And I was like, you know what?
[16874.72s -> 16876.72s]  Well, if you feel
[16877.20s -> 16878.40s]  There he is
[16878.40s -> 16880.40s]  Oh shit
[16884.80s -> 16887.04s]  That was he's not really that scary actually
[16887.92s -> 16899.24s]  Hey, honestly if I were him too, I wouldn't say anything either
[16902.04s -> 16906.28s]  You just shut up and disconnect as quick as you can. Yeah, just just literally pull your ethernet cable up
[16908.41s -> 16915.00s]  And make a new account
[16915.00s -> 16917.16s]  It's like what are the signs that like if I have worms?
[16921.44s -> 16922.96s]  um
[16922.96s -> 16925.44s]  Probably gastric upset I would say probably number one
[16926.24s -> 16927.20s]  uh
[16927.20s -> 16934.56s]  Is that a talisman not what the hell is that?
[16938.08s -> 16939.28s]  uh
[16939.28s -> 16941.74s]  gastric issues
[16941.74s -> 16943.58s]  I would say
[16943.58s -> 16944.86s]  diarrhea
[16944.86s -> 16946.30s]  How have you been?
[16946.30s -> 16948.30s]  You think I'd feel a little tickle?
[16949.15s -> 16955.15s]  I would imagine you would feel quite a few gurgles if it were if it were me answering
[16955.79s -> 16957.15s]  so
[16957.15s -> 16960.35s]  I know that like everyone whenever they're talking about hand
[16961.15s -> 16962.99s]  uh the thumb
[16962.99s -> 16964.99s]  is always the uh
[16965.23s -> 16968.67s]  Kind of the hero of the hand everyone's like, oh that's a human hand the thumb
[16969.23s -> 16972.67s]  How do you feel about like I I feel like fingernails are kind of underrated
[16973.23s -> 16979.47s]  Not even remotely close to thumbs not even close. In fact, I think I think the raw pork is is mutated your brain at this point
[16980.35s -> 16982.35s]  I think the raw pork is mutated his brain
[16983.07s -> 16986.99s]  You think that an opposable thumb is not as important as your fingernails
[16987.07s -> 16990.99s]  Can you imagine not having like fingernails and just having like just like normal?
[16992.59s -> 16994.59s]  I think these these are the worms talking
[16999.87s -> 17005.87s]  I yeah, I think scientists have said that eventually we might just evolve them out like they just won't exist anymore
[17006.19s -> 17008.67s]  Really? I think so. That's that's been a debate. I
[17009.63s -> 17011.63s]  I use them so much though like
[17012.35s -> 17016.35s]  You have to like really pick at something on like um, like you drop something between your keyboard
[17016.43s -> 17019.07s]  Like how are you gonna get it out if you don't have fingernails? I mean
[17019.79s -> 17023.39s]  That's one tiny shitty little thing to you. I mean you could use like a
[17024.67s -> 17026.67s]  That's like we're we're using them
[17027.48s -> 17031.24s]  I don't my fingernails are used i'm trying like scratching my ass
[17033.36s -> 17037.20s]  I think i'm just all i'm saying is I don't think fingernails get enough credit because the thumb
[17037.68s -> 17042.48s]  Takes all the fucking all right. Give me a fingernail tier list of things you can do with it
[17042.48s -> 17045.12s]  That's what what are you saying is like, okay number one
[17046.16s -> 17047.44s]  Do you not?
[17047.44s -> 17053.92s]  Because picking up like a coin on your desk if that's s tier for you. I'm sorry that that is a good example
[17054.00s -> 17056.00s]  Thank you. I didn't even have to come up with that one
[17056.72s -> 17058.40s]  That's like d
[17058.40s -> 17062.17s]  You ever like scratch a dog?
[17062.41s -> 17067.45s]  Yeah, that's gone. If you can't like really get underneath the like the fur and like give them a real good scratch
[17069.56s -> 17073.16s]  You can't do that without fingernails. All right, we like we're just walking in circles
[17074.64s -> 17076.64s]  I think you could still get like friction
[17077.44s -> 17080.76s]  Hold on a second
[17080.76s -> 17091.07s]  Your dog would know the difference it still works. What about peeling an orange?
[17092.46s -> 17094.78s]  True you never never
[17095.74s -> 17101.02s]  I uh when I was young sorry for uh, you know, uh sensory overload alert don't listen
[17101.66s -> 17104.06s]  Uh, one of my my big toenail came clean off
[17105.68s -> 17111.68s]  And I gotta tell you uh, certainly appreciate it having toenails after that. I can only imagine for fingers
[17112.48s -> 17116.00s]  Every single person in the whole world that's here. Just all of us went
[17117.82s -> 17120.78s]  I gave the sensory overload warning. It was fair game
[17122.56s -> 17126.40s]  Um sensory overload I think is like if you were to dance while singing
[17127.04s -> 17130.80s]  Not like hey, this is disgusting. I just got right. Oh, I got a rune
[17132.97s -> 17136.81s]  Great rune of the unborn. Oh, that's um, very lucarious, isn't it?
[17137.21s -> 17140.73s]  I got dragon cult prayer book. What do you do with that? Because i'm kind of
[17141.45s -> 17143.13s]  Using the dragon thing
[17143.13s -> 17144.83s]  I think you can now
[17144.83s -> 17147.52s]  raft stuff
[17147.52s -> 17149.52s]  All right. Where is this? Uh
[17149.84s -> 17151.71s]  Oh, yeah
[17151.71s -> 17154.99s]  Yeah, maybe like a gross out warning not a sensory overload
[17155.31s -> 17160.75s]  I gotta say I feel bad that everyone is upset that I told them something bad happened to me and not like
[17161.74s -> 17165.60s]  Sensory they don't they don't feel bad for me sensory overload here about it
[17165.68s -> 17170.80s]  No sensory overload is if you were like, hey, just want to tell you sensory overload. I got a story to tell you
[17171.60s -> 17174.80s]  So when I was uh, again, you know what I mean? That's that's sensory overload
[17177.80s -> 17180.19s]  You didn't see what I did
[17180.19s -> 17182.75s]  But that to me is sensory overload
[17182.75s -> 17186.67s]  Where the fuck are we going? Where's the entry or like if you started like doing like spells and like flashing a bunch of stuff
[17186.75s -> 17189.31s]  On the screen and if I started doing spells
[17189.47s -> 17194.11s]  Yeah, if you were casting spells and like and they were like screams and like sound effects sound effects sound effects
[17195.87s -> 17197.87s]  I use the wrong term. Hold on this
[17199.95s -> 17215.92s]  Come on here. We have a problem. What we have a double boss scenario here. Oh god
[17216.32s -> 17219.52s]  I think we focus the one on the right first
[17229.50s -> 17232.54s]  Uh there the boss does not care that we're doing this
[17233.34s -> 17235.56s]  Okay. Well that was good
[17235.56s -> 17238.28s]  That actually saves us a lot of pain and suffering
[17239.08s -> 17243.96s]  Did we get any other guy we could just I can hit him with a dragon breath
[17244.52s -> 17259.02s]  Okay, go for it. Oh my god
[17259.74s -> 17261.74s]  Insta-dej, I never even got up
[17262.54s -> 17264.54s]  Where the hell did I just end up?
[17265.87s -> 17267.87s]  It's okay. We can serve him from the spawn
[17270.91s -> 17276.83s]  You just like you just changed you just changed the weather and it just fucked me up so bad. Oh, sorry
[17277.39s -> 17288.08s]  Really
[17300.59s -> 17303.47s]  No, it does not are you serious
[17304.11s -> 17308.51s]  Are you serious? I don't want to laugh because it's like kind of like not good if that's happening to you
[17308.83s -> 17312.91s]  I don't want to like laugh. But are you all right? I don't have uh,
[17313.71s -> 17317.04s]  I don't have anything else to eat
[17317.77s -> 17320.25s]  Dude you all right. Can I tell you what you really should do tonight?
[17321.31s -> 17322.19s]  just
[17322.19s -> 17325.31s]  Like make some like just rice just make some rice
[17326.64s -> 17330.56s]  And eat a little bit of rice and like some toast and don't eat anything else
[17331.20s -> 17333.68s]  Don't eat any more backpack daisy food
[17345.39s -> 17350.96s]  Whoops, but I rest it so I probably reset it. I don't know where you are. You did
[17352.19s -> 17354.75s]  Oh great. I don't know why I didn't spawn at this long
[17355.55s -> 17359.10s]  Because I definitely
[17359.10s -> 17363.18s]  Dude, you were fighting the whole time then you were like doing good. I actually was doing well
[17363.34s -> 17368.62s]  I had him down to like 40 34 35 percent. Honestly, we have to fight him fight them both again
[17369.58s -> 17371.88s]  We have to kill this. How about we just don't
[17372.36s -> 17374.54s]  This is a boss. You should like heal
[17375.26s -> 17380.62s]  Don't worry about me and worry about the fucking like diarrhea. You're gonna have in 40 minutes
[17395.69s -> 17397.69s]  Beware of the scarlet rot
[17406.38s -> 17410.33s]  Wow, you're not doing too well
[17410.33s -> 17411.85s]  Have I died?
[17411.85s -> 17413.85s]  I don't see a death thing on the screen
[17414.41s -> 17416.36s]  Well, congrats
[17416.36s -> 17418.84s]  You were just waiting just you were waiting like is low
[17423.10s -> 17425.02s]  Mo like is dead
[17425.02s -> 17428.14s]  All right. Oh, okay
[17432.65s -> 17446.83s]  Wow
[17446.83s -> 17449.07s]  Oh, that's what that is
[17451.56s -> 17456.68s]  Am I not how am I not hitting this person because uh, because he had made a grab animation so you can't oh
[17457.40s -> 17459.40s]  He was using he was like he's like using a door
[17460.92s -> 17474.33s]  I could reset it again. I we're not quite dead yet
[17475.29s -> 17478.30s]  It could be it could be much worse right now
[17478.70s -> 17481.32s]  It's a really bad place for him to be doing this
[17482.67s -> 17486.35s]  Come over here. Come over here. I had I got the heal ready. I don't
[17487.23s -> 17489.23s]  It's just
[17491.64s -> 17493.64s]  I'm helping i'm helping come on
[17494.14s -> 17495.26s]  focus
[17495.26s -> 17496.86s]  You're not focused
[17496.86s -> 17498.86s]  I gotta get that down. He keeps doing it
[17499.26s -> 17526.68s]  He's doing power
[17526.68s -> 17528.68s]  Watch out for his ultimate power
[17531.96s -> 17533.96s]  Oh fuck he comes down with it
[17534.52s -> 17542.00s]  I'm gonna go reset it
[17542.00s -> 17544.00s]  We haven't lost yet
[17548.03s -> 17554.83s]  Yeah, but this isn't going well. It's we had he's at 50 percent. It's we're okay
[17555.79s -> 17563.00s]  I mentally give up
[17563.88s -> 17565.88s]  Mentally you can't give up
[17567.26s -> 17569.10s]  Don't give up
[17569.10s -> 17571.10s]  Don't give up. Don't give up
[17571.98s -> 17573.42s]  Sora
[17573.42s -> 17575.42s]  Just imagine this is millennia
[17575.58s -> 17578.46s]  You know what I mean? This is my millennia
[17578.78s -> 17580.62s]  I hate this enemy
[17580.62s -> 17599.68s]  All right. I'm gonna be honest if I had like
[17600.24s -> 17604.32s]  Stir with 10 fucking effort. We would probably have already beat this
[17605.20s -> 17606.80s]  That's fucked up
[17606.80s -> 17611.92s]  How do I get out run?
[17611.92s -> 17618.38s]  Fucking sigma
[17630.11s -> 17632.80s]  You reset I had
[17632.80s -> 17633.92s]  you
[17633.92s -> 17637.92s]  Okay, I only had like a few I had you reset it and I was still fighting the enemy
[17638.16s -> 17641.52s]  So I lost out on like four heals because you reset it the first time
[17642.08s -> 17644.08s]  Okay, we'll come back
[17644.70s -> 17646.14s]  I can't
[17646.14s -> 17648.48s]  So you can't no
[17648.48s -> 17650.48s]  Then why was I able to come back?
[17650.72s -> 17662.32s]  Maybe you're the host
[17662.32s -> 17664.44s]  You can do it
[17664.44s -> 17666.44s]  I took this boss's health down
[17667.00s -> 17668.12s]  like
[17668.20s -> 17669.88s]  70 percent
[17669.88s -> 17674.81s]  Yeah, but he just like spams
[17675.84s -> 17677.84s]  Like he doesn't even play the game like right
[17683.68s -> 17687.92s]  You know what I mean? Yeah, that's definitely like a like a soul caliber fan take
[17688.80s -> 17706.44s]  Okay
[17706.44s -> 17709.48s]  That missed me and you saw it you saw that it missed it actually kind of looked like it did
[17712.80s -> 17715.23s]  Okay, can you take this seriously?
[17715.23s -> 17718.59s]  He's also I guarantee you this dude's gonna drop nothing
[17719.15s -> 17721.15s]  There's a there's a if you look down at your controller
[17721.47s -> 17722.59s]  As I um
[17722.59s -> 17728.01s]  I wasn't doing this for a little while the first like a little bit that I was playing but if you look down
[17728.83s -> 17732.19s]  There's a red b button and if you press that you dodge
[17732.91s -> 17733.71s]  um
[17733.71s -> 17737.39s]  You should press that when there's like a right at the moment right before you get hit
[17737.71s -> 17742.59s]  I just didn't know if you know i'll try but my game crashed
[17743.39s -> 17752.51s]  Fuck so bad. My game crashed mine's crashed too
[17758.06s -> 17772.36s]  Well, let's try it again last time somebody gave you that advice germa. You growled at them. Yeah, I know
[17772.92s -> 17774.92s]  Why that's why I thought it was
[17775.80s -> 17777.24s]  No, I really did
[17777.24s -> 17783.72s]  I was fighting that lightning tree sentinel outside the city and I was having some trouble
[17785.58s -> 17788.78s]  And the person's like what they say was hey, dude
[17788.78s -> 17794.04s]  I don't know if you know this but the horse has a dodge and I just I just it just did it
[17794.52s -> 17799.77s]  I just I went off
[17799.77s -> 17803.47s]  Uh, I think my game is actually broken
[17804.44s -> 17807.98s]  Uh mod bat. Yep, not the that's the one I just did
[17808.84s -> 17819.96s]  Well, I'm in it's almost like the process is still going hold on. Yeah. Elden ring is still technically running
[17828.84s -> 17835.45s]  Coming back. I'm sorry to bring it up again, but I really gotta say
[17836.17s -> 17841.29s]  I feel like I ate that pork and I got away with it and there's kind of a thrill
[17848.68s -> 17854.22s]  Okay, uh, you say that now and in potentially a few hours from now
[17855.15s -> 17858.83s]  On your fourth vomit into the toilet. You're gonna be like that was a dumb thing
[17859.63s -> 17863.23s]  I ate it yesterday afternoon. I think if I was gonna get sick, I'd be sick by now
[17864.38s -> 17866.12s]  that's true
[17866.12s -> 17868.20s]  I really feel like like I fucking
[17869.53s -> 17870.65s]  You know like
[17870.65s -> 17872.65s]  I played the gamble and I won
[17873.13s -> 17876.01s]  Don't get used to that. Don't get used to oh, yeah
[17876.01s -> 17881.21s]  You know what? Uh, if I that means I could probably do that again and be completely and totally fine
[17881.29s -> 17885.61s]  No, you lucked out big time. Wasn't there some youtuber who used to like eat shoes?

[17933.84s -> 17936.64s]  Are you telling me that worms are immune to heat?
[17937.04s -> 17943.12s]  Worms don't like garlic is the thing i've heard. I don't know. It's I think worms actually don't like garlic
[17944.08s -> 17947.52s]  That's real, right? I heard worms don't like your fucking stream, dude

[18085.88s -> 18087.88s]  They said it's actually
[18087.88s -> 18093.00s]  You gotta avoid you gotta like there's a dodge button. It's b on the controller right before you get hit
[18093.80s -> 18098.70s]  You gotta press it
[18098.70s -> 18102.99s]  Oh, look at that. I did it
[18102.99s -> 18104.99s]  Where the fuck is he going?
[18105.15s -> 18108.19s]  This is I
[18108.19s -> 18111.20s]  I think he's stuck
[18111.20s -> 18114.00s]  That's actually he's kind of bad because yeah, he'll do that
[18137.07s -> 18141.84s]  watch out
[18141.84s -> 18143.60s]  Dude, he's coming for you, dude

[18162.30s -> 18164.30s]  Why did that take me so long to get up?
[18165.28s -> 18202.56s]  Uh, it hit me really weird. I don't know what happened. The choke is real right there. You're running. There's one ahead of him
[18203.37s -> 18205.21s]  Oh my god

[18224.33s -> 18226.33s]  Hey, by the way, you're
[18226.41s -> 18230.73s]  You are so fucking happy that this just happened because I just got an ability
[18231.13s -> 18232.97s]  I got a thing that you
[18232.97s -> 18237.05s]  Are going to be obsessed with and by you. I mean me get an item
[18240.00s -> 18242.48s]  This is probably the best trinket in the whole game
[18244.32s -> 18246.64s]  maximum hp stamina equipment load
[18251.34s -> 18256.00s]  Disgusting. Oh dude, is that the fucking the one with the talisman with the thing?
[18256.56s -> 18260.24s]  I get plus two equipment load plus two stamina plus two max health
[18261.13s -> 18263.13s]  best trinket in the game is
[18264.88s -> 18268.88s]  Stir whatever you do. Don't put the garlic next to your butthole. The worms might crawl even deeper
[18269.98s -> 18273.42s]  I didn't say that on my stream. I just want to make sure everyone knows you didn't okay
[18277.34s -> 18279.42s]  All right. So so true my friend
[18280.30s -> 18281.50s]  we
[18281.50s -> 18292.49s]  Getting into the capital is interesting from here. I hope I hope they respond
[18294.20s -> 18298.38s]  They actually might
[18298.38s -> 18301.18s]  Okay, so there's a few ways to get into the capital
[18302.97s -> 18306.60s]  But we could also your favorite you want to let's do the archery
[18307.00s -> 18312.27s]  Go to the outer wall battleground and let's do the archery. Actually. Yeah, can we do it from there?
[18319.24s -> 18321.64s]  Why are all these hills so dang close range?
[18322.28s -> 18329.44s]  Because it'd be really powerful if you could just do that and heal everybody
[18329.68s -> 18345.90s]  Sorry, I assumed you didn't know tv dinners were pre-cooked. I thought stir was just eating a soggy hungry man. No
[18347.47s -> 18349.47s]  No, that's not. Yeah, that's
[18350.27s -> 18353.44s]  In fact, I would I don't think there's anything wrong with that
[18355.08s -> 18361.63s]  Like that's all right. Why why would it be a soggy hungry man? We're like like I would still cook it
[18362.11s -> 18378.16s]  All right, let's do the archery soggy cooked. Yeah, i'm saying that that wouldn't be that big of a deal
[18378.16s -> 18387.16s]  That wouldn't be a problem to me. You're talking to somebody that actually really genuinely does not
[18387.72s -> 18388.92s]  hate
[18388.92s -> 18393.40s]  Those salisbury steak tv dinners and I talked about this already and everyone was like what the fuck is wrong with you?
[18394.49s -> 18396.97s]  There I they're okay. I don't hate those
[18399.66s -> 18403.13s]  That whole meal is soggy. Do you like sushi?
[18405.31s -> 18407.55s]  Very occasionally. Yes
[18410.00s -> 18413.13s]  Wrong I like
[18413.45s -> 18414.73s]  I
[18414.73s -> 18416.73s]  Hey, hey convince me. Otherwise
[18419.29s -> 18422.01s]  Can you convince me? What what do they do to sushi?
[18423.88s -> 18424.84s]  they
[18424.84s -> 18431.48s]  Cut it up and they put it over a thing of rice or in a roll. They don't like they don't do they don't do anything
[18431.72s -> 18439.40s]  Some depends some places do correct me if i'm wrong. Some places do like steam it right for like a certain amount of time
[18440.75s -> 18442.99s]  um, if a traditional sushi is just they
[18444.96s -> 18446.40s]  just fish
[18446.40s -> 18448.72s]  Sometimes they'll freeze it
[18448.72s -> 18450.72s]  Like if I didn't want to cook I wouldn't eat
[18452.33s -> 18454.20s]  You know what I mean?
[18454.20s -> 18456.04s]  sushi is
[18456.04s -> 18458.30s]  Okay
[18458.30s -> 18462.70s]  I don't like eating a lot of it if you get oh, this is a salmon roll
[18463.34s -> 18467.58s]  All right, cool. Let me let me have one. Ooh, that's pretty fresh. That tastes really good
[18468.22s -> 18473.42s]  Okay, wait, but what's up? You got a spicy tuna roll there. Oh, no. Yeah, i'll take one. That's raw. That's gross
[18473.50s -> 18475.50s]  I'm gonna eat like raw fish
[18475.74s -> 18478.54s]  It tastes good. I can't cook a pork and you can eat raw fish
[18480.67s -> 18482.70s]  um
[18482.70s -> 18488.62s]  If you it's not about the foodborne illnesses that you can get from sushi as long as it's prepared correctly
[18490.36s -> 18492.40s]  It's yeah, you can
[18492.40s -> 18496.56s]  But the difference that you and you trust the sushi guy you go to at the mini mall
[18497.82s -> 18501.10s]  I'm not going to a mini mall to get sushi. Where did you get that from?
[18502.46s -> 18504.46s]  a mini mall
[18504.54s -> 18506.22s]  the fucking

[18537.31s -> 18541.24s]  I'm alive. Don't worry
[18541.24s -> 18542.92s]  Hey worry about yourself
[18542.92s -> 18551.29s]  Okay, i'm gonna go over here and worry about myself then I thought we were a team

[18559.13s -> 18561.69s]  What sushi no, I said, but sushi
[18563.15s -> 18565.74s]  It's good
[18565.74s -> 18569.74s]  It's good, but I have to really really be in the mood. I'm only gonna have a few pieces
[18570.38s -> 18574.22s]  I know some people that are like, oh, yeah, like give me like five different roles. I'm gonna eat all of it
[18574.54s -> 18577.02s]  No, i'll have some not that much
[18596.83s -> 18598.83s]  Really like to hit you with that but whatever
[18599.55s -> 18608.86s]  Oh my goodness
[18608.86s -> 18610.86s]  He was targeting you with that at first
[18612.04s -> 18613.16s]  He did
[18613.16s -> 18615.24s]  You hit me with the first two. This is so
[18616.74s -> 18620.76s]  Unsatisfying to not be able to keep hold right now. You have no idea
[18622.01s -> 18627.39s]  I just want to keep hold
[18627.39s -> 18629.39s]  You say keep pulse one more time
[18629.95s -> 18631.95s]  And I swear i'm going to
[18632.57s -> 18635.45s]  Leave this fight
[18635.45s -> 18636.73s]  Who needs you?
[18636.73s -> 18640.57s]  Oh looks like somebody got hit there, right?
[18641.21s -> 18644.73s]  Looks like somebody. Oh somebody got hit twice. Oh, I wonder if you're gonna get hurt time
[18644.81s -> 18649.21s]  Maybe three stars third time to charm out. No, look at you. Look out for that. Hey watch out
[18649.45s -> 18651.66s]  He's coming in again
[18651.66s -> 18655.58s]  Don't worry star. Don't worry buddy. I'll beat the boss for us. Don't worry
[18656.30s -> 18714.68s]  I'll be back
[18714.68s -> 18731.72s]  You so badly want me to lose so you can scream at me. I can feel it. I can feel you just going like
[18762.62s -> 18793.39s]  Boy, i'd like my 20 in ones, please you beat it. Is he still here?
[18794.11s -> 18799.24s]  Have you beat it? I beat it. Okay, cool
[18804.49s -> 18816.36s]  I have one in the bathroom. I'm feeling so good. All right, let's go. Oh, I got 80
[18817.00s -> 18821.52s]  Pick up your souls. That's 80 000. All right
[18822.00s -> 18828.70s]  I was talking to you the whole time too. Did you bring your headphones to the bathroom? I mine are wired
[18829.66s -> 18834.94s]  I don't want the government fucking listening into my gamer talk. I was talking so much shit, dude. It was
[18835.90s -> 18839.10s]  I was like, oh, yeah, what about this? What about that? You were just gone you left
[18840.03s -> 18846.83s]  Yep, you know that goes with the uh, the good old saying how do you get bullied on the internet?
[18846.83s -> 18849.55s]  Just fucking turn the monitor off. I didn't even know
[18851.84s -> 18854.00s]  You were just talking. I actually was talking to nobody
[18854.72s -> 18856.72s]  I wasn't even talking to chat. I was just like
[18857.28s -> 18859.28s]  I feel like that means I win
[18859.90s -> 18862.57s]  It kind of does mean that
[18862.57s -> 18864.01s]  Yeah
[18864.01s -> 18866.96s]  No, that's all right. I still beat the boss
[18867.60s -> 18870.16s]  It's called a uh, that's called a parry reversal
[18870.88s -> 18873.93s]  Do we need a great rune to do this?
[18873.93s -> 18875.93s]  You cannot proceed without more great runes
[18876.73s -> 18877.77s]  Oh
[18877.77s -> 18880.81s]  I'm doing plus one more great rune. Do we actually need more?
[18881.61s -> 18885.93s]  Yeah, I believe we need two
[18885.93s -> 18887.45s]  We both have one
[18887.45s -> 18889.53s]  Can you drop them?
[18889.61s -> 18893.69s]  And just the same one I just I got the same one you did the unborn
[18895.88s -> 18897.26s]  Yeah
[18897.26s -> 18904.35s]  Okay again, I think we actually have to go back to millennia unless we could go
[18907.04s -> 18909.21s]  Where could we go?
[18913.23s -> 18915.31s]  What about k-lid is there anything in k-lid we could do
[18918.59s -> 18922.36s]  oh just random like tomes and tombs and
[18923.56s -> 18926.76s]  It's just random, right?
[18927.00s -> 18931.16s]  It has seemed like this run is weighted a little bit to drop better stuff at more important bosses
[18931.40s -> 18933.80s]  Oh, that's right. They're a tree. Let's do the ear tree
[18936.46s -> 18939.36s]  the
[18939.36s -> 18941.36s]  One tree the one that's right here
[18942.08s -> 18946.88s]  Okay. Hmm
[18946.88s -> 18950.60s]  the ronnie quest
[18950.60s -> 18952.60s]  Also, I have like all the ronnie items
[18954.24s -> 18957.84s]  We could have a little doll ronnie. I have the finger blade. I have
[18958.80s -> 18961.76s]  The servetus helmet. I i've got so much shit from it
[18962.86s -> 18963.42s]  I don't know
[18963.42s -> 18968.62s]  I don't know where it's used when it's used why it's used or what the fuck she's talking about and why she wants the world
[18968.62s -> 18971.18s]  To be in darkness, but I am there for it
[18976.62s -> 18983.79s]  Um, I feel like every few months I try to remind myself exactly what the hell is going on in this game
[18984.59s -> 18988.11s]  And I always just kind of get stuck again where I go. Wait, what actually the fuck is happening?
[18989.82s -> 18994.06s]  And then I watch uh baddie videos like three hours and then I go. Oh, that's right
[18994.06s -> 18996.54s]  I know everything and then I forget all of it in like a week
[18997.79s -> 19003.31s]  Uh, all right. So yeah, that was never a boss down here. It was just I guess technically it's just this group
[19003.95s -> 19005.95s]  And the stuff in the
[19019.84s -> 19021.90s]  And
[19021.90s -> 19023.66s]  alo scythe
[19023.66s -> 19025.52s]  That's a good item
[19025.52s -> 19027.52s]  carrion glint blade staff
[19029.40s -> 19032.06s]  Oh, I found a faith talisman
[19035.21s -> 19040.58s]  Plus 10 mine i'm not doing it again. Oh, no, this is potency of incantations
[19041.12s -> 19047.50s]  I think that actually that i'll take that i'll take that I can't I don't think I can drop this
[19048.96s -> 19052.00s]  All right. I don't think you can drop these drop it drop it
[19053.18s -> 19056.12s]  Drop it drop it
[19058.11s -> 19059.58s]  I can
[19059.58s -> 19062.27s]  You're welcome
[19064.84s -> 19077.48s]  Ooh, whoo. Who's gonna wear this I think
[19078.36s -> 19084.01s]  This is how I already had one. I already had one and it wasn't equipped
[19087.16s -> 19091.10s]  Nice. Oh, isn't there a cave like right here? I think there is
[19093.50s -> 19114.38s]  It is somewhere here, where is it check the cookbook recipes
[19115.18s -> 19119.42s]  Yeah, but we can't craft anything without the crafting item the thing that you get in the first minute
[19119.82s -> 19122.54s]  Crafting item they don't seem random. They all seem the same
[19126.24s -> 19132.32s]  It seemed like the uh, the first guy at the church of ella was selling the crafting thing no matter what really
[19133.88s -> 19137.66s]  Yeah, I bought it from him
[19137.66s -> 19141.26s]  I have a voodoo doll of you. What should I do? Um, can you just like I don't know
[19141.74s -> 19146.22s]  Put it in front of like the air conditioner on like, you know, like 70 degrees and just let me just chill there
[19146.78s -> 19152.00s]  Come on, man. What are you thinking? Oh, it's a view. I don't get one
[19152.70s -> 19154.25s]  typical
[19154.25s -> 19156.25s]  Just make speaking of him instead
[19156.65s -> 19160.09s]  Okay, can you open up my voodoo doll and like see if there's anything in like the stomach?
[19160.33s -> 19164.09s]  Yeah, can just like yeah open up the summer part. See if there's any worms in there
[19165.29s -> 19169.44s]  but like carefully
[19169.44s -> 19173.98s]  Ow you popped your pimple you
[19176.60s -> 19189.04s]  Say it that dog is very angry
[19194.32s -> 19196.40s]  We uh, I mentioned this before all right story
[19196.40s -> 19199.92s]  So if somebody was casting like negative magical spells against me
[19200.32s -> 19205.36s]  But there were other people casting positive magical spells against me. They kind of just run into each other, right?
[19209.13s -> 19214.25s]  They run into each other like it's I mean if somebody's doing like magical spells to make me feel bad
[19214.25s -> 19216.81s]  But people are also casting magical spells to make me feel good
[19217.61s -> 19220.91s]  Wouldn't it just be the answer? The answer is very obviously
[19221.53s -> 19227.21s]  There's gonna be 99 dudes casting positive vibes on you and the one dude's gonna cast negative and that's gonna be like a critical
[19228.17s -> 19230.17s]  No, I don't think so
[19237.66s -> 19245.80s]  Ooh, that's good. I have so many comments azor
[19248.04s -> 19250.36s]  Those are thing i'm faith now that dude
[19252.12s -> 19257.84s]  Give it up. Give it up. This is the comment of the year so far. We are describing
[19258.62s -> 19260.96s]  YouTube comments
[19260.96s -> 19267.58s]  Yeah, that's what that's what I thought it was like in reference to no, what do you mean?
[19268.14s -> 19273.50s]  I thought you were doing like a like my twitch chat like sends posi vibes and some people send no no no no
[19273.58s -> 19275.58s]  I'm talking about like actually casting spells
[19276.14s -> 19279.90s]  Oh, well, like what kind of spells are they are they pagan rituals? I don't know
[19280.72s -> 19282.72s]  Uh, are they a cult? Um
[19283.20s -> 19287.18s]  Something else demonic in nature. I could help you with this
[19287.74s -> 19291.36s]  But I need to know specifics
[19291.36s -> 19296.70s]  So what what should I like wear to like get the negative spells away again?
[19296.70s -> 19300.62s]  It depends what kind of spells they are just like okay, let's general like
[19304.24s -> 19309.58s]  General negative spells what you should you should wear. Um garlic
[19310.36s -> 19324.84s]  Uh, i'm gonna say old navy. All right wear of ruin of protection. Yeah, the the infamous curse this
[19326.04s -> 19329.50s]  Penis curse
[19329.58s -> 19333.53s]  I remember
[19333.53s -> 19337.32s]  I was pleading with chat to have the whatever
[19338.44s -> 19340.80s]  pleading with god
[19340.80s -> 19347.26s]  Take it back. It's so small. Why didn't you just make me a woman?
[19349.72s -> 19353.95s]  Do you do you ever hear that story when I was getting cursed? No
[19355.98s -> 19360.44s]  Somebody somebody somebody came into the chat and they were like, hey dude
[19360.44s -> 19365.00s]  I'm like casting a small penis curse against you and I was like, well, all right, somebody's cast want to make it bigger
[19367.02s -> 19372.43s]  It's all is that what this is trying to see if it's like evening out and I was like
[19374.03s -> 19378.75s]  But then I was like wait half of you shouldn't half of you do want because what if it goes too far
[19379.71s -> 19382.03s]  What if they're like, oh we all have to do this because we have to help him
[19382.67s -> 19388.92s]  That would be bad
[19388.92s -> 19394.46s]  Uh, I don't know if I can help you with this
[19396.00s -> 19399.44s]  Just sounds like this just sounds rough rough situation to be in
[19408.81s -> 19417.66s]  Any like updates on how it's been going? I'm just saying what spells they're casting at me
[19422.22s -> 19423.74s]  All right, are we?
[19423.74s -> 19425.50s]  are we
[19425.50s -> 19428.70s]  You can like open up my character sheet and see what like I have against me right now
[19435.68s -> 19440.00s]  I don't like this slob
[19440.00s -> 19442.00s]  I don't think this one has very much health
[19445.18s -> 19449.50s]  Does not
[19449.50s -> 19452.46s]  You would think I was getting hit less if my character didn't scream so loud
[19454.08s -> 19455.68s]  Actually kind of true
[19455.68s -> 19458.91s]  Like why doesn't your character like scream at all?
[19461.80s -> 19468.20s]  And my character is like a 13 syllable scream. I think my character does just not as loud
[19469.16s -> 19485.60s]  Well, all right, so we need to figure out what the hell we're gonna do here
[19486.08s -> 19490.08s]  I'm just following you thinking about I don't know if I could help you with this curse situation
[19490.88s -> 19499.88s]  We need another great rune
[19500.84s -> 19507.13s]  But doing even doing ronnie's quest will not give it to us because it's probably gonna be a random item
[19507.77s -> 19510.01s]  We need to just find random shit
[19512.04s -> 19517.64s]  Hey, dude, are you gonna shove an entire remembrance up your ass? Uh
[19525.37s -> 19529.21s]  I don't want to give that meme any more attention that I already have but like that was
[19529.85s -> 19532.57s]  But like that was like humorous enough for me to read it
[19534.11s -> 19536.11s]  All right. What about we go in this cave?
[19537.85s -> 19541.29s]  Anything for you in my leash? All right teleport to the outer wall phantom tree
[19547.56s -> 19559.34s]  You've already voted to warp to this destination and we can kill we could try milania again
[19559.42s -> 19561.42s]  But I feel like that's gonna give us
[19561.42s -> 19563.42s]  both headaches
[19563.50s -> 19568.84s]  Um
[19568.84s -> 19583.34s]  I'll heal you. Okay rewarp. Try it again
[19600.03s -> 19611.31s]  Bye hints. I'm not gonna cast any spells, but instead i'm praying for your salvation and hopes our lovely lord above will forgive you
[19611.95s -> 19614.51s]  And well, I appreciate that though like that's
[19615.71s -> 19617.71s]  That that that should help right?
[19620.08s -> 19621.44s]  I wasn't listening
[19621.44s -> 19623.44s]  No, thanks. Thank you
[19623.76s -> 19627.02s]  All right
[19627.02s -> 19629.02s]  All right. So from here we're going down
[19629.42s -> 19631.50s]  To this cave just because I feel like going
[19633.32s -> 19635.32s]  Hey, hey, buddy. Hey
[19635.72s -> 19636.60s]  Yeah
[19636.60s -> 19640.62s]  For the guild for the guild
[19644.70s -> 19647.98s]  I got the flame of frenzy. I could do it if I wanted to
[19650.81s -> 19652.41s]  I have enough faith
[19652.41s -> 19654.51s]  Get three finger me
[19654.51s -> 19655.79s]  I could
[19655.79s -> 19665.18s]  We gotta go down there
[19665.74s -> 19667.74s]  Don't jump. It's gonna get you hurt
[19688.00s -> 19690.00s]  What do you think about uh
[19690.24s -> 19692.28s]  Go to milania. No
[19692.28s -> 19693.96s]  Do you know what I think?
[19693.96s -> 19696.84s]  And I don't think I ever saw this in like an elden ring video
[19696.92s -> 19700.28s]  But it always it's always the thing that's like, huh that has me thinking
[19700.84s -> 19702.84s]  Yeah, is that the uh
[19703.00s -> 19706.36s]  So the giants don't have heads because their faces are in their bodies
[19708.08s -> 19712.41s]  You're dead. How did you die? I don't I honestly don't even fucking know what happened
[19713.13s -> 19716.32s]  I guess I just got
[19716.32s -> 19718.32s]  Electrocuted like over on I don't know
[19718.40s -> 19729.31s]  Okay. Hey, welcome back. You're talking about giants. Yeah, so the giants don't have heads their faces are inside their stomachs
[19729.87s -> 19733.63s]  Okay, and then I I also had like this weird thought I was like, okay
[19733.63s -> 19736.59s]  Well, what if their brains in a different spot and their brain is in their hands?
[19737.23s -> 19739.95s]  That's why when you hurt the giant's hands, that's this weak spot
[19740.91s -> 19744.99s]  Because like the three fingers and the two fingers is obviously like it's like a giant sized hand
[19745.07s -> 19747.15s]  I was like dude, what if these are just like giant brains?
[19747.95s -> 19751.85s]  They do have that they do have heads
[19755.47s -> 19758.59s]  Uh, I mean the two fingers and the three fingers obviously a part of the same hand
[19759.15s -> 19761.15s]  I think that's you could probably argue that
[19761.87s -> 19765.95s]  Uh part of the same hand that maybe split up and oh we have two different
[19766.75s -> 19772.73s]  Philosophies or something. I don't know the whole hand. Maybe the dlc will put the hand together possibly
[19773.29s -> 19778.81s]  Maybe there'll be other full hands hands are a big thing in this game the hand enemies and stuff
[19779.29s -> 19783.36s]  There are other two fingers, but that they're probably maybe the other three fingers
[19784.32s -> 19789.68s]  They were probably all i'm just saying normally enemies weak points is like hit the enemy in the head
[19789.92s -> 19792.24s]  But the giant is like oh shit hit his hand
[19792.80s -> 19794.80s]  Hey, easy shield enemy. Oh head
[19795.79s -> 19797.79s]  I've got a special special enemy down here
[19815.76s -> 19817.76s]  What's your favorite haichu flavor
[19819.21s -> 19821.37s]  My favorite haichu haichu
[19822.33s -> 19829.34s]  Flavor the fuck are you saying? What is your favorite haichu flavor?
[19830.14s -> 19833.08s]  Can I get an example?
[19833.08s -> 19836.44s]  You just okay. So the the answer to the question is i've never eaten one of these before
[19836.84s -> 19846.70s]  Like haichu like you're sneezing like my favorite sneeze mine's mango. I like peach
[19852.24s -> 19853.60s]  Haichus suck
[19853.60s -> 19860.40s]  What do you know? They don't height to me and I gotta i'm a big fan of this company
[19860.40s -> 19868.01s]  I'm a big fan of these but haichus are if starburst gave a shit you come down here
[19868.88s -> 19882.92s]  I'm just saying and I love starburst. I love to go to anime conventions and eat pocky
[19884.25s -> 19890.49s]  Those are good strawberry, uh strawberry and cherry
[19891.44s -> 19893.80s]  uh starburst
[19894.41s -> 19896.41s]  Our our s plus
[19896.49s -> 19898.33s]  But i'm sorry
[19898.33s -> 19900.33s]  I feel like they haven't innovated in the game at all
[19906.25s -> 19909.69s]  The classics need to innovate. Well, hold on a minute. Look, what about what about rices?
[19910.33s -> 19915.13s]  Look at all the different rices there are there's so many different innovative new rices and they're actually pretty good are there
[19915.45s -> 19919.05s]  Oh, yeah, i've never seen one think of all the innovations that have happened in rices
[19920.28s -> 19921.88s]  like what
[19921.88s -> 19926.36s]  Peanut butter rices that's that's a big skeleton rices thins
[19927.72s -> 19930.90s]  That is a huge skeleton. Let me see if he's paying attention
[19932.89s -> 19934.24s]  Hey
[19934.24s -> 19938.65s]  Hey, who did that?
[19938.65s -> 19940.97s]  Okay, how come he doesn't lack the whole game?
[19941.77s -> 19943.77s]  What the birds do? Um
[19944.01s -> 19948.04s]  We need to get out of here
[19948.04s -> 19950.65s]  Who fucking hit him?
[19950.65s -> 19952.73s]  I don't think we fight this. I think we just go
[19962.73s -> 19964.73s]  One little bone
[19964.97s -> 19966.81s]  on the tree branch
[19966.81s -> 19967.93s]  Let's go
[19967.93s -> 19975.71s]  Do you know what else is really interesting about elden ring lore never hear anyone talk about this? Sure
[19976.03s -> 19980.27s]  You know a lot of people pronounce the word three and they can't speak english. They say tree
[19981.31s -> 19986.43s]  So anything it's interesting they have the tree fingers and how important the uh, the urn tree is
[19991.93s -> 19994.17s]  Wait, did you go say that again? I just I
[19996.03s -> 20000.06s]  You you say
[20000.06s -> 20007.31s]  What tree?
[20007.31s -> 20009.71s]  Don't worry about it. It's kind of above your pay grade
[20017.26s -> 20019.26s]  Um, but okay, but what about gideon?
[20020.54s -> 20024.94s]  What about him if gideon said three fingers he'd go. Oh, you've probably seen the tree fingers
[20026.30s -> 20029.71s]  What are you talking about? Well, not everyone pronounces it that way
[20035.77s -> 20040.25s]  Like some say cost some say cost cost some say cost
[20041.05s -> 20045.29s]  Grand does eyes grand does eyes people say three and some people say tree
[20046.17s -> 20048.57s]  Like you once did for the vacuous rom
[20050.51s -> 20052.51s]  the oh
[20052.75s -> 20059.29s]  Knowing armor
[20059.29s -> 20064.52s]  Okay, we need to go through
[20064.52s -> 20067.28s]  Got him. I did so much damage
[20067.76s -> 20070.32s]  Why don't we just do the thing just drop down and kill him from the top?
[20070.88s -> 20075.29s]  This is like the easiest way to kill these
[20076.08s -> 20077.36s]  Do it then
[20077.36s -> 20080.40s]  Can you like move him a little bit towards you like aggro me over?
[20080.48s -> 20082.72s]  Hey, did you know if you hit the top of it? Yeah
[20084.99s -> 20086.51s]  Just pull them this way
[20086.51s -> 20090.27s]  I'll get him i'm stuck on this ant. Why do you look like a half-cooked hot dog?
[20090.83s -> 20093.71s]  Um, I don't know bro fucking fuck off
[20095.13s -> 20104.97s]  Whoa
[20104.97s -> 20107.85s]  I got him. Oh i'm doing so much damage
[20111.45s -> 20114.57s]  Hey, hey, hey group up guilty guilty group up
[20121.66s -> 20126.46s]  Good always gonna make sure you that you can be prepared for anything. So that means you're pretty good healer
[20127.60s -> 20132.38s]  Yeah, okay. So we got a
[20132.38s -> 20134.38s]  Is there another wall shadow priest?
[20134.78s -> 20138.70s]  There's another wall somewhere, right? There's gotta be another wall. There's always another wall
[20144.00s -> 20163.60s]  Found it
[20163.60s -> 20165.44s]  Watch out slugman
[20165.44s -> 20175.66s]  Oh, isn't this where the big ass little thing is?
[20176.22s -> 20179.58s]  This one here isn't this uh, isn't this the well in dark souls, too?
[20181.82s -> 20184.46s]  uh
[20184.46s -> 20189.10s]  No, I would make this more aligned with the um, the big tree in dark souls one
[20191.92s -> 20200.97s]  The big tree the tree what's it called? Yeah, no great great something great the big tree
[20201.53s -> 20206.32s]  Yeah, I missed that area. No, you didn't i've like watched you play it
[20207.28s -> 20212.40s]  I act the the like those like secret tree area. That's like it's not even secret way off to the side
[20212.48s -> 20216.80s]  I I played and saw dark souls one so many times before I realized that area existed. I'm like
[20217.44s -> 20219.44s]  I'm telling you i'm a fraud
[20219.68s -> 20221.20s]  I think you just
[20221.28s -> 20224.88s]  Want to beat stuff so quickly that you just don't care if you miss something
[20224.88s -> 20233.88s]  No, it's not you're you're misrepresenting me right now. I could take you to court. Yeah, but what would you even what would you sue me for?
[20235.70s -> 20249.04s]  Defamation watch out big guy in here. This is the isn't this the right? This is the same
[20249.04s -> 20251.04s]  This is the correct enemy that's supposed to be in here
[20251.64s -> 20252.86s]  Is it?
[20252.86s -> 20257.72s]  I think so
[20257.72s -> 20275.56s]  I'm pretty sure this is what's actually in here. I thought he was gonna kill me in one hit
[20276.36s -> 20283.05s]  He's got so much lighting on him. It's hard to see where he is
[20295.39s -> 20296.51s]  Nice
[20296.51s -> 20300.22s]  I got the glaive of gilgamesh
[20300.70s -> 20302.88s]  I got the seedbed curse
[20302.96s -> 20304.40s]  Stay away from me
[20304.40s -> 20309.20s]  Ah, I got a remembrance actually did you really that's good. You know the omen king
[20311.10s -> 20313.66s]  You know him, you know who that is the omen king
[20314.94s -> 20317.31s]  Uh, is that bog?
[20317.31s -> 20319.31s]  Or is that margott?
[20321.13s -> 20323.53s]  You really you need to go watch three more hours of videos
[20325.52s -> 20328.40s]  I believe you're talking about morgott
[20328.96s -> 20331.68s]  I feel like i'm hitting you with lore that you never even considered before
[20332.16s -> 20336.08s]  And you're just you don't even remember like anything. No, I i'm telling you
[20336.48s -> 20341.20s]  I was obsessed with all this game's lore everything about it. I just loved every second of it
[20345.40s -> 20347.47s]  You got me wrong
[20347.47s -> 20349.79s]  And you never even considered it was the tree fingers
[20352.70s -> 20377.52s]  Okay, just go do double get double teach and kill millennia enough to level up. Okay. Well, this one doesn't open yet. All right, so
[20378.56s -> 20383.31s]  That's how we get to here
[20383.31s -> 20385.64s]  This thing doesn't open yet
[20385.64s -> 20387.64s]  We can't get into the capital
[20389.50s -> 20392.98s]  We can't we have to beat millennia
[20396.20s -> 20398.20s]  We have to
[20402.70s -> 20406.30s]  I mean, I guess I think we're kind of have to just I think we have to kill millennia
[20406.62s -> 20411.90s]  I think we gotta kill millennia unless we just did random like catacombs and stuff to try to find a run
[20413.00s -> 20415.00s]  Uh, what's um
[20415.24s -> 20421.31s]  You know the whole like upside down tower ronnie's quest thing thing. Yeah, I I have the device
[20421.79s -> 20424.83s]  You want to go to it we kept saying we have all the ronnie shit and the finger blade
[20426.04s -> 20431.48s]  All right, i'm mark to ronnie. Yeah ranala or remi. All right, what does she want me to call her?
[20431.96s -> 20444.41s]  Uh, let's go to ronnie's rise. Yeah, is she even there? Do we have to talk to servetus man?
[20446.62s -> 20453.24s]  Um, I don't does she move because she goes to sleep forever and she's just totally just like this part of the game's boring
[20453.24s -> 20466.94s]  Wake me up when it's over. I don't know. Yeah
[20467.90s -> 20474.08s]  Uh, can we do that funny thing that we did before where we pitch our voice down one tiny notch
[20475.12s -> 20477.76s]  Keep it on permanently until like people just leave
[20478.56s -> 20488.32s]  Yeah, uh sounds pretty good. Okay. I think you're pitched a little bit too a little a little too low
[20488.64s -> 20490.94s]  Yeah, a little higher than that. Um
[20491.42s -> 20505.05s]  Uh a little higher no lower. I mean then it's not on at all. Okay, so I I can do something
[20506.01s -> 20510.08s]  Wait, oh, I don't I don't want to do that. I almost just ruined our whole playthrough
[20510.99s -> 20513.87s]  Did you just like hit her in the head with a sword? No, I almost just did the
[20514.75s -> 20520.92s]  Weird quest thingy where like isn't that I don't got administered drought. What's that?
[20523.02s -> 20527.56s]  Like you give her like a fucking poison. I yeah, I think I could like kill her or something. Okay
[20527.56s -> 20538.48s]  I'm not going over there. Okay. She uh, do we get on stairs and blade is like you took my waifu and we kill him
[20538.72s -> 20542.19s]  I think it happens later
[20542.19s -> 20568.36s]  I think that happens after you burn the tree and I can we get your best like wolf snarl
[20568.68s -> 20580.68s]  That was a bird but it was a decent attempt. All right. What what did she say?
[20582.36s -> 20586.60s]  Uh, she says she also has to go on a journey and she I think she gives you the doll
[20586.76s -> 20591.00s]  I think we gotta go talk to the other tower guy. Don't we have to talk to the doll at a certain place?
[20591.56s -> 20593.66s]  underground somewhere
[20593.66s -> 20602.01s]  Uh, yeah the other like nocturn sit dude. This quest is so fucked. What do we have to do for like why are we doing this?
[20602.17s -> 20604.17s]  Why did I bring this up again?
[20605.07s -> 20620.03s]  We're trying to get a rune trying to engage in my interest. I was just he likes pretending to be like a wolf
[20620.27s -> 20627.26s]  We can't what if I give them like an easy one? It's probably the wrong one. There's another one, right?
[20627.42s -> 20630.36s]  Or is it there is the third tower?
[20630.68s -> 20638.33s]  Isn't that the one is the three tower sisters? Oh like the three fingers
[20638.89s -> 20640.01s]  Remember?
[20640.01s -> 20642.01s]  Yeah, I do the three fingers
[20642.33s -> 20648.04s]  Do you think there's any significance?
[20648.04s -> 20653.79s]  Um, I don't know. Do you want to like no clip and fly around this area for like 16 hours? Let's kill those dragons
[20653.95s -> 20668.08s]  Oh, here's here's the land six. Is that someone I should know? This is one of the other
[20668.64s -> 20676.01s]  Dragons that you fight secretly. Oh, who is this one of the other dragons?
[20676.57s -> 20679.52s]  This is the placid eucach's
[20679.52s -> 20684.76s]  I don't know. I don't I don't know. It's one of these like the blood. He's just one of the dragons
[20710.27s -> 20713.60s]  Jumping he he'd teleport it
[20715.23s -> 20729.80s]  To where I don't know. Is this like monster hunter? You got to go like find his next area
[20730.20s -> 20733.15s]  I mean the help are still on the screen
[20733.39s -> 20757.55s]  Oh shit, just got the urn tree great shield. I think he's gone
[20760.94s -> 20767.77s]  No, is he only here like at night time or something? They have like a day change make him go. Bye. Bye
[20769.40s -> 20770.92s]  He's about to respawn
[20770.92s -> 20772.92s]  Go to the entrance of the three sisters
[20777.39s -> 20778.75s]  I actually don't remember
[20778.75s -> 20787.37s]  Not over there
[20787.37s -> 20796.78s]  Butthead. Oh, I found the service man tower accept the task
[20799.87s -> 20802.99s]  He handed over the potion in question, which was three smithing stone
[20803.63s -> 20811.02s]  And then you need nefali to drink the potion. I actually have the potion. I think I have denied it
[20812.28s -> 20817.40s]  She was like, I don't want to drink that I'm I'm fucking gluten-free or whatever
[20819.39s -> 20821.39s]  Oh my god, he looks fucking
[20822.64s -> 20824.64s]  He looks like shit
[20832.06s -> 20842.75s]  Okay, thanks for the golden rune, okay, I have that potion yeah
[20851.45s -> 20853.45s]  Okay
[20858.64s -> 20862.41s]  Rock blaster
[20862.49s -> 20864.86s]  Explosive ghost flame
[20864.86s -> 20871.88s]  Ooh night comet night comets actually really good. Isn't it for you? I'm not doing magic anymore. Oh
[20873.16s -> 20894.43s]  Yes, so i'm gonna kill this guy kind of a dick get it. Oh, this is where petri dish is
[20904.70s -> 20909.37s]  Uh pidea
[20909.37s -> 20915.08s]  Great rune really? No, I was gonna say come on. Why didn't I get none?
[20918.76s -> 20922.03s]  All right. Well now what?
[20922.27s -> 20926.19s]  Reload the area. I'm talking a pity. Um, I don't we don't gotta kill the dragon
[20930.51s -> 20946.68s]  Did you go down here did right? Did you go down? My minimap is my map is wrong, man
[20949.24s -> 20953.72s]  Oh, I think you're inside here. We can just teleport somewhere. I just wanted to see what he was selling
[20960.99s -> 20968.76s]  Why are you doing that? I ate this weird raw pork chop. I heat it up
[20969.48s -> 20971.56s]  Was there for like 16 hours?
[20971.56s -> 20973.72s]  Oh, haha. I figured it would be all right
[20974.44s -> 20977.32s]  Living my life story now
[20977.32s -> 20977.64s]  All right
[20977.64s -> 20982.36s]  We need to go somewhere and we need to figure out we need to get a another rune or we need to actually just go
[20982.36s -> 20984.36s]  Let's go kill. Let's go millennia. Let's go
[20984.92s -> 20987.16s]  Let's do it. Oh, he said let's go
[20988.42s -> 20990.42s]  Millennia, let's do it millennia
[20991.93s -> 21001.07s]  Where's the right bonfire? Let's go get millennia. Where's pidea? Am I in the right spot for pidea?
[21001.55s -> 21003.82s]  I was just kind of jumping around
[21003.82s -> 21006.06s]  No, you gotta like fall off the edge. There's like a
[21007.23s -> 21010.08s]  Castle. Yeah, somebody behind you
[21010.16s -> 21013.04s]  Behind here is right here. I know this item's
[21014.46s -> 21026.11s]  Behind one of these could be a great run behind I never found this person
[21027.87s -> 21033.05s]  Really? No. Wow. What a loser you are. I thought you played this game
[21033.93s -> 21044.22s]  Yeah, how does it feel? Pretty good
[21062.27s -> 21067.21s]  Dude i've never been down here. Holy shit
[21072.06s -> 21076.40s]  Cool. All right. Are you ready to fight?
[21077.02s -> 21081.12s]  Millennia and have us both rage quit the stream in about 30 minutes
[21081.76s -> 21088.78s]  I say that we um for the prediction. I think we could do it in like 60 tries
[21089.90s -> 21095.74s]  Do you have any runes? Yeah, I need 4 000
[21099.28s -> 21101.28s]  Hey you your runes
[21102.00s -> 21107.02s]  Give them to me. Yeah, it's kind of just like gold farming
[21108.22s -> 21125.31s]  You should be you should pretend to be mad at stir
[21127.23s -> 21132.52s]  He'll hear he doesn't pretend
[21137.23s -> 21141.23s]  All right. You ready to just kind of bang our heads against the wall for a little bit?
[21143.85s -> 21146.86s]  Okay, if we do it
[21147.26s -> 21149.98s]  We just I think we've been playing for a while. We warmed up a lot
[21149.98s -> 21153.10s]  I mean this was six hours in if we're gonna do it. We're gonna do it right now
[21153.26s -> 21155.26s]  I actually know how to dodge now
[21155.42s -> 21157.42s]  All right. So where is the good place to go to?
[21159.05s -> 21182.59s]  Uh, hey bro, did you forget the whole game too? Nice. Yep. I don't know. I feel like one of these
[21183.23s -> 21203.39s]  Yes tall
[21203.39s -> 21205.39s]  Will they beat millennia in 10 tries?
[21206.17s -> 21228.89s]  Hmm I that's possible. I wonder we'll see let me make sure I got the right gear on millennia is slash, right?
[21233.18s -> 21239.64s]  I believe law of regression heals all ailments that should get rid of scarlet rot in case we get you know bad pickle
[21239.88s -> 21259.20s]  Is all gonna be heavy
[21259.20s -> 21284.08s]  All right. So points are in we have 10 real attempts. Are you ready? Yep. All right, let's go soldiers for the guild
[21285.74s -> 21287.74s]  We've been trying to clear this raid for a month
[21288.38s -> 21290.38s]  We have the big guilds have already done it
[21292.94s -> 21297.90s]  We're the last ones. We're not trying to get world first or anything. We're just trying to just participate
[21300.24s -> 21303.80s]  They're out gearing us
[21303.80s -> 21307.96s]  Which is making making them they're getting more loot in the chinese new year event
[21312.60s -> 21314.60s]  They spent plenty of time developing
[21315.00s -> 21319.82s]  Okay, just to get dropped from china. All right. All right. All right. Are you ready? You're right
[21327.29s -> 21331.29s]  Wait
[21331.29s -> 21356.83s]  Waiting i'm hitting her
[21356.99s -> 21358.03s]  You are
[21358.03s -> 21360.03s]  Every time I jump she dodges
[21365.64s -> 21369.48s]  I i'm fucking i need a brain for a second. I'm stuck in a fucking lamp post
[21370.36s -> 21378.11s]  I like glint stone pebble better here
[21378.43s -> 21387.52s]  She can go up anytime. Yeah
[21387.92s -> 21394.78s]  Oh
[21394.78s -> 21397.04s]  Excellent. Good job. Excellent
[21408.78s -> 21414.86s]  My fucking button clicked in this stupid button the button clicked in and it's a crouch
[21417.24s -> 21419.07s]  literally
[21419.07s -> 21420.19s]  the
[21420.19s -> 21422.35s]  worst place for a fucking crouch
[21423.07s -> 21442.08s]  I
[21442.08s -> 21447.36s]  Left stick push in his crouch. Do you know how much people grip this fucking game and they like, you know
[21447.36s -> 21455.21s]  How many times that happens?
[21455.21s -> 21457.37s]  Just just trying some stuff seeing how it goes
[21458.67s -> 21459.71s]  learning
[21459.71s -> 21462.68s]  Didn't you rebind it? Oh, yeah, this is a whole nother game client
[21467.96s -> 21469.32s]  not the
[21469.32s -> 21476.68s]  Original game client. Oh and I gotta go unbind crouch to the left stick
[21477.24s -> 21487.18s]  Do you ever have that problem?
[21487.18s -> 21494.44s]  No, where like you you're pushing down on like running around and you and you click in the left stick because you're pushing down hard
[21495.45s -> 21499.87s]  And this bullshit happens never done it. I've been there somebody says it
[21500.86s -> 21503.23s]  I believe that it's a thing
[21503.23s -> 21506.11s]  And what these controllers really need is a mind detector
[21510.72s -> 21516.25s]  We could just get a little bit closer to the user's intent. Hold on a second. This is all fucked up
[21518.78s -> 21522.16s]  Okay, that's better. I feel like switching to faith was a meme
[21523.31s -> 21529.16s]  Okay, i'm better
[21529.16s -> 21531.64s]  And I am objectively worse than our last fight
[21532.68s -> 21535.56s]  I don't think so. I think we're okay
[21535.56s -> 21537.08s]  You're doing pretty well
[21537.08s -> 21539.08s]  Until I press the fucking left stick in
[21539.96s -> 21550.46s]  You know, it kind of reminds me of when
[21550.86s -> 21552.06s]  hitting
[21552.06s -> 21553.68s]  uh
[21553.68s -> 21557.04s]  Light attack and forward was kick in some of the other games
[21559.48s -> 21573.18s]  Yeah, I did that quite a bit
[21573.18s -> 21574.78s]  in my personal opinion
[21574.78s -> 21576.78s]  Get anything bound off the movement button
[21582.51s -> 21587.95s]  Okay, that one was uh, it was a good attempt. Yeah, we're good. We're good a little bit of a controller issue didn't count
[21588.67s -> 21602.62s]  Oh, you would just go for the caster
[21604.08s -> 21609.68s]  Wow, that was my bad. I didn't even realize that at first that you changed targets. That was not a good attempt. All right
[21611.72s -> 21613.72s]  Dude, like glintstone pebble
[21614.83s -> 21616.51s]  It's the best spell in the game
[21616.51s -> 21621.28s]  What are you using now?
[21621.28s -> 21627.71s]  Now I got like lightning bolt and she can actually dodge it because it doesn't track at all. So glintstone pebble is
[21628.88s -> 21630.67s]  gone
[21630.67s -> 21633.61s]  Uh, well i'm faith skilled now
[21634.17s -> 21637.71s]  I distinctly remember us having an argument about this very subject
[21638.51s -> 21639.71s]  Did we?
[21639.71s -> 21641.15s]  edgar alan poe
[21641.15s -> 21643.77s]  I distinctly remember
[21643.77s -> 21644.97s]  us
[21644.97s -> 21647.05s]  Squabbling over this very very subject
[21650.84s -> 21652.84s]  He's disassociating
[21653.24s -> 21655.24s]  So that's a fight for Lydia
[21662.94s -> 21664.94s]  He thinks he's gonna play
[21664.94s -> 21673.50s]  Maybe it'll help did we I don't remember talking about it
[21674.64s -> 21676.40s]  Here I am hit me
[21676.40s -> 21684.72s]  Let us go up the elevator
[21684.72s -> 21686.72s]  Brother there's an arrow in your back
[21687.36s -> 21700.49s]  Hello millennium
[21700.49s -> 21709.12s]  I'm here
[21709.12s -> 21710.80s]  Excellent first maneuver
[21710.80s -> 21713.55s]  Although I seem to have dodged quite a few of them
[21724.40s -> 21732.38s]  Pressing the attack I see
[21732.38s -> 21737.07s]  That I didn't do it
[21737.07s -> 21740.43s]  Yeah
[21740.43s -> 21745.00s]  Yeah, you did
[21745.00s -> 21747.00s]  Yeah, it also did more damage
[21747.24s -> 21751.72s]  But what that buffered so hard
[21766.04s -> 21776.46s]  We do so much less damage now because it's because she's scaling no, is that what it is? No, she's scaled to
[21777.42s -> 21783.50s]  The room that she's in i'm just saying that my lightning deals less damage than my glintstone pebble did and it's harder to hit her with it
[21784.30s -> 21788.01s]  She's gonna dodge it every time
[21792.08s -> 21794.08s]  Unless she's a big dumb dumb
[21798.86s -> 21804.94s]  Let her get me
[21804.94s -> 21806.94s]  Be scaled to have lower health if anything
[21817.05s -> 21823.29s]  Phase two is is if phase one is giving us some trouble already phase two is gonna be such a pain in the ass
[21824.99s -> 21828.57s]  Um, I think i'm bad
[21829.28s -> 21834.80s]  Uh, and i've got 100 fizz mitigation shield was letting me just live through the uh, the flurry
[21836.08s -> 21838.64s]  So maybe I should put one on too
[21838.88s -> 21843.37s]  I figure even if she hurts me and she does heal from hitting you but like as long as I don't
[21844.09s -> 21847.12s]  Fucking insta die
[21847.12s -> 21849.12s]  I'm just gonna i'm just gonna sword no magic
[21849.36s -> 21854.16s]  I can use my greater heals. Actually, let me go back. Oh you already jumped. I mean, I thought I thought I was
[21855.04s -> 21856.40s]  Holding you up
[21856.40s -> 21861.84s]  I have a few magic flasks. You know what? You know what? Let's yeah, let's just reset it. Let's go. No, no, no
[21862.00s -> 21864.64s]  No, okay. Yeah, let's just let's just reset. Let's just reset
[21865.12s -> 21867.12s]  Reset it. I gotta move some gear around
[21868.56s -> 21870.56s]  That doesn't count. That doesn't that's not a real attempt
[21873.12s -> 21875.12s]  Yeah, our reset doesn't count. That's not fair
[21878.17s -> 21881.21s]  We have to traverse the fog door for it to be a real attempt
[21882.17s -> 21884.17s]  I called it before I jumped down
[21885.69s -> 21887.13s]  Sour boys
[21887.13s -> 21890.25s]  Because I have three fucking mana flasks. I don't need
[21891.45s -> 21897.45s]  How heavy is it?
[21897.45s -> 21898.97s]  It's way too heavy
[21898.97s -> 21918.91s]  I think I just had to be good
[21918.91s -> 21920.43s]  Okay, you ready?
[21920.43s -> 21931.20s]  I don't know how many weapons you've like considered using and how much stuff you've done and i'm seriously still like
[21932.16s -> 21934.16s]  How we just happened to work?
[21934.88s -> 21939.02s]  I don't know that did a lot of damage here. I'll use uh, I have the healings still equipped
[21939.02s -> 21944.81s]  I can use before the door
[21944.81s -> 21946.41s]  Yeah, don't heal yourself
[21946.41s -> 21949.71s]  I think the dog is
[21949.71s -> 21952.38s]  Right behind us
[21952.38s -> 21953.66s]  Thank god
[21953.66s -> 21960.14s]  Did that not get you?
[21960.14s -> 21962.54s]  I think it did I can't tell
[21965.02s -> 21967.82s]  dead
[21967.82s -> 21970.57s]  The other one was the lord's heal
[21973.95s -> 21978.51s]  Lord sworn
[21978.51s -> 21985.23s]  Okay
[21985.23s -> 21988.06s]  Okay
[21988.06s -> 21991.82s]  No disrespect to the battle mercies out there, but really let's go balls out
[21994.68s -> 21997.48s]  Don't waste all your stamina bar. She could go up at any time
[22000.57s -> 22008.78s]  Let's go
[22008.78s -> 22013.37s]  Hi
[22013.37s -> 22017.21s]  Fucking i'm
[22046.24s -> 22048.24s]  What what was that?
[22056.99s -> 22058.91s]  Dude that okay. Somebody help me that like
[22060.59s -> 22064.91s]  Like how do you do you dodge through it or to the left right? How do I do get how do I do that?
[22066.52s -> 22068.52s]  That like da da da da da da da
[22068.84s -> 22078.73s]  So if you dodge forward to the right or forward it's in and then to the right so it's forward right
[22079.82s -> 22084.30s]  Right and then back. I think it's in yeah, it's in and to the right
[22094.38s -> 22096.40s]  Wait
[22096.40s -> 22098.51s]  I just saw you
[22098.51s -> 22103.39s]  Kicking up a little a little flame there. It looks like you were doing are you going for some parries here?
[22104.03s -> 22109.58s]  Are you alive?
[22109.58s -> 22115.72s]  Yeah, I don't know. It is
[22116.36s -> 22118.76s]  I forget like what she does that you can parry
[22120.36s -> 22122.76s]  And then you still have to parry her three times
[22135.68s -> 22137.68s]  You can parry waterfowl
[22137.76s -> 22146.38s]  Good luck. You did you die? Did you actually just do that much damage to me? We're just trying to get by man
[22146.86s -> 22148.54s]  We're just trying to get by
[22148.54s -> 22177.37s]  How's that not hurting her it's being real weird
[22178.17s -> 22186.86s]  She could do it
[22186.86s -> 22191.56s]  Be aware
[22191.56s -> 22198.48s]  I'm so paranoid. Yeah
[22198.64s -> 22201.76s]  Easy easy, dude. No fucking damage
[22202.56s -> 22214.72s]  What really?
[22214.72s -> 22246.38s]  Jumping me nice dodge get her
[22254.52s -> 22271.36s]  Watch that she could go up
[22288.38s -> 22311.47s]  Where's the stagger? All right. Oh, what the fuck
[22312.33s -> 22327.80s]  What the fuck we're good. Watch that rot. She's being extra careful. She's on me
[22328.36s -> 22341.79s]  What the fuck is my character doing?
[22341.87s -> 22343.87s]  dude
[22345.23s -> 22348.51s]  She grabbed me from fucking behind again
[22351.45s -> 22354.65s]  She was going for you and she fucking grabbed me
[22358.54s -> 22362.94s]  I rolled like into it. It's just there's so much shit happening on the fucking screen
[22369.07s -> 22371.47s]  I just like forget that she even has that fucking move
[22372.11s -> 22374.11s]  This character sucks
[22378.41s -> 22381.21s]  Uh, she heals when you block by the way, apparently. Yeah, I I know
[22382.01s -> 22385.15s]  She kills you when you don't dude
[22400.89s -> 22403.45s]  I in my I told you my normal playthrough
[22403.45s -> 22406.17s]  I killed her with mimic tear and the whole time my shot was like dude
[22406.17s -> 22410.09s]  She heals when she hits the mimic tear and I just fucking just kept jumping on her until she died
[22411.42s -> 22416.14s]  Sometimes you gotta take the l to get the dub. I beat her with tish. I just let tish fight her
[22416.30s -> 22429.78s]  I was like, I don't even care you saved stir. That was literally a get down. Mr. President
[22440.70s -> 22443.20s]  Oh my god, dude
[22443.28s -> 22449.04s]  I can't I can't i'm stuck. I'm stuck. I can't I can't anakin. I'm too weak. I can't
[22462.38s -> 22465.28s]  All right, dude, are we ever gonna be able to do this?
[22465.92s -> 22467.55s]  Yeah
[22467.55s -> 22473.71s]  I mean we're good until you got one shot by a grab. Hey, but you what I stopped you from getting one shot by the grab
[22474.68s -> 22476.68s]  I don't think it looked like that on my screen
[22476.92s -> 22479.10s]  because I I
[22479.18s -> 22481.18s]  Don't feel like I was in danger
[22482.44s -> 22487.16s]  You know, maybe i'm wrong do you need a great heal? Oh no, you're in there
[22487.32s -> 22493.80s]  Okay, I mean we're either gonna do it or we're not I don't think the extra 20 15% health is gonna be a problem
[22494.44s -> 22496.44s]  I mean if you had a little bit more health last time
[22497.00s -> 22499.88s]  I mean she did it was like almost 100%
[22523.40s -> 22524.52s]  Heal
[22524.52s -> 22526.44s]  Yeah, i'm gonna start hitting her right away
[22526.44s -> 22528.44s]  And she's probably gonna go from here
[22530.46s -> 22534.54s]  Yep
[22534.54s -> 22537.42s]  Oh Jesus she went to you. I'm good
[22538.06s -> 22559.72s]  Afraid that she's gonna do it. That was a weird jump
[22570.51s -> 22572.51s]  Oh, come on
[22574.91s -> 22584.38s]  Come on we gotta do this to the fucking guild
[22586.22s -> 22588.40s]  You know, you know what?
[22588.40s -> 22592.32s]  I think fighting together makes it harder because it's almost like she's going after you
[22592.40s -> 22594.40s]  But like I get hit by her hitbox sometimes
[22600.54s -> 22606.14s]  Oh, I was wondering why I wasn't healing. I was praying. I was pressing the neo heal button from like the last 20 seconds
[22618.32s -> 22622.64s]  Now germa's blaming me what it is. It is kind of fucked up that you're blaming me. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa
[22622.80s -> 22628.97s]  Don't let chat tell you something that didn't happen. I just said that it's almost like fighting her solo would be easier
[22630.14s -> 22632.46s]  So do you want to you want to take turns? No
[22637.05s -> 22639.53s]  I feel like that is saying that i'm it's my fault
[22639.93s -> 22643.93s]  No, no, no, i'm just saying that that I by my presence is making it harder for you
[22648.86s -> 22650.86s]  He's dragging you down, dude
[22652.03s -> 22654.03s]  I mean i'll let you go in
[22654.03s -> 22655.79s]  Solo for a bit
[22655.79s -> 22658.03s]  All right, let me go in in solo
[22658.83s -> 22663.23s]  And I will tell you if I need your help, okay, and then you can come in full health and shit
[22664.28s -> 22668.38s]  Wait a minute. This could be genius
[22668.38s -> 22671.26s]  If you need me, but you won't need me. All right, so if I need you
[22672.06s -> 22674.30s]  I'm gonna call you in you're gonna be full health refreshed
[22675.10s -> 22678.30s]  Yeah, all right. I'm just gonna be in the locker room
[22683.34s -> 22686.60s]  All right
[22686.60s -> 22688.51s]  I'm going in
[22688.51s -> 22724.88s]  Okay
[22724.88s -> 22726.98s]  The forces of diablo grow stronger
[22751.24s -> 22755.42s]  Hey, yeah, I was in just a bad spot for it. Um
[22756.54s -> 22758.54s]  Oh, yes, come on in dude
[22759.18s -> 22761.64s]  Yeah, I got this
[22761.64s -> 22770.86s]  I was just in a bad spot. Oh, good luck. Let's try dude. I gotta get a shield on
[22771.42s -> 22774.06s]  Just block the first one roll the next one. She's an idiot
[22774.86s -> 22780.14s]  Who cares if she heals a little bit chats could always be like, oh she's fucking she dude. No, she's she's healing
[22781.34s -> 22783.84s]  Yeah chat
[22783.84s -> 22785.84s]  Why is she? Oh, okay
[22788.41s -> 22791.53s]  I mean, I don't think I i'm gonna do the whole place like solo though
[22794.73s -> 22799.77s]  Uh, dude, I think it's time. We just bring in two. Oh mega spirit summons and just who gives a shit
[22799.77s -> 22802.49s]  Let's get let's get out of here fights yet and you're giving up
[22802.57s -> 22808.73s]  I don't why do you want to fight millennia this fight sucks absolute balls like you don't who wants to play this?
[22809.29s -> 22811.29s]  Nobody wants to fight this character
[22811.69s -> 22814.19s]  Let's get the summons and get rid of this motherfucker
[22815.92s -> 22817.92s]  But she heals off the summons
[22817.92s -> 22836.73s]  All right, not until the bed. That's fine. And no more screaming. I'm not gonna i'm not i'm not a scream streamer like youtuber. Come on
[22837.21s -> 22843.55s]  Settle down. I have a strategy
[22845.07s -> 22846.35s]  What if we like
[22846.35s -> 22851.52s]  What if we like both fighter?
[22851.52s -> 22857.13s]  Yeah, that works that way we can we can try and keep her staggered for longer
[22857.85s -> 22863.13s]  If like both of us are hitting her. I mean i'm just saying you you give me the go-ahead i'm going back to the spirit summon
[22863.85s -> 22866.73s]  Trainer and i'm just gonna get tish to like plus eight
[22867.29s -> 22870.97s]  Who is she? She is the probably the best summon in the game
[22871.85s -> 22873.37s]  it's just
[22873.37s -> 22880.25s]  Such a good she's so good at everything and she literally killed millennia on by herself. I didn't even do anything when I played it
[22885.76s -> 22897.84s]  Okay
[22897.84s -> 22900.88s]  Let's let's just try both like to see what happens if we both fight her
[22903.48s -> 22907.56s]  Which we've never done before i'll go in first usually you go in first and like curse it
[22908.36s -> 22912.14s]  It's true
[22912.14s -> 22914.14s]  I don't have a fucking spirit bell
[22921.21s -> 22923.85s]  You're playing around with your fucking bell. I thought I thought we were doing this together
[22923.93s -> 22927.45s]  I actually thought we were doing this together and like we would stagger her and you wouldn't miss every swing
[22927.69s -> 22932.81s]  I didn't even get dude. You went up there and just fucking died. You went up there and died dude. I didn't
[22940.88s -> 22945.44s]  Because you're trying to look in your fucking back pocket for queen latifah. Let me out here. Let me out, please
[22946.00s -> 22947.84s]  Somebody please let me out
[22947.84s -> 22961.36s]  Just fucking kidding
[22961.36s -> 22963.36s]  Oh the fight begins
[22965.63s -> 22967.63s]  Oh, I feel so alive
[22976.32s -> 22979.68s]  Jerma what you don't understand is it's a dance. It's a dance
[22983.56s -> 22985.56s]  Which is not even rigged on to beat her
[23006.67s -> 23009.72s]  dance
[23009.80s -> 23018.99s]  Yeah, how come I don't have a spirit bell because it's an item you gotta get do you have a spirit bell?
[23019.23s -> 23023.20s]  How did I not get it?
[23023.20s -> 23026.48s]  I mean, oh, it's it's just random that sucks
[23027.04s -> 23032.72s]  I think it probably counts as a key item and you could probably get it from somewhere. Hold on. Are we sure that I don't have it?
[23034.27s -> 23036.27s]  Wait, wait, wait. I have that rot thing on
[23038.30s -> 23054.38s]  Why do I have we both died? Why do I have the wrong thing? That's weird. I just don't have enough mana
[23055.98s -> 23058.92s]  That's probably not gonna happen
[23058.92s -> 23060.92s]  Just don't die to her like spaghetti
[23065.28s -> 23068.32s]  Okay, come on ralphy that's fucked up
[23119.80s -> 23123.80s]  Um, where are um, i'm going up you you blocked me
[23124.76s -> 23126.92s]  Uh, wait, I can't get it back. Hold on
[23128.51s -> 23131.95s]  Hey, you know what? Just reset reset. We gotta no going going going going i'm in
[23133.13s -> 23134.81s]  This is coming in too
[23134.81s -> 23137.53s]  Here. I got uh, I got the spell. Let me use my spell
[23143.32s -> 23147.39s]  oh
[23147.47s -> 23158.16s]  So fresh one more one more you beat this game. How are you so bad?
[23160.49s -> 23162.49s]  dude
[23162.57s -> 23175.12s]  I'm gonna respond to that one real fight real focus if you lose this auto gets it. I'm day
[23175.68s -> 23177.68s]  I'm going in i'm in i'm already in where are you?
[23207.95s -> 23238.56s]  If she's she doing some jumps going in
[23266.11s -> 23268.11s]  Every time you go to attack
[23268.19s -> 23270.19s]  She moves the other player
[23289.98s -> 23293.95s]  Easy
[23293.95s -> 23295.95s]  Yeah, she is kind of easy, huh?
[23296.43s -> 23300.89s]  It's very actually very hard. Where were you looking?
[23301.61s -> 23304.97s]  I'm, all right, but that was very annoying. I'm incredibly annoyed by it
[23305.69s -> 23362.84s]  Okay, hold on. Oh that's what she's doing
[23365.64s -> 23367.64s]  Dude, what is she doing?
[23368.36s -> 23370.36s]  What is she doing?
[23370.75s -> 23391.48s]  I saved you
[23391.48s -> 23393.72s]  Little bro doesn't even have his controller plugged in
[23396.19s -> 23412.57s]  What are you talking about talking about me man last heal besides slow heal
[23415.98s -> 23418.16s]  Damn, she really sick with it
[23428.35s -> 23436.62s]  I gotta save him
[23436.62s -> 23438.62s]  This is the weird ghost shit
[23445.40s -> 23447.90s]  I'm dead. I'm on my head
[23450.75s -> 23452.75s]  Dude, i'm going out. I'm going out
[23453.31s -> 23457.79s]  I expelled all the air out of my body. It's just fucking I saw stars for one second
[23470.20s -> 23473.12s]  It's so hard
[23473.12s -> 23486.19s]  Best one yet. That was pretty good. Try your l2. It takes so long. It's not worth it. That was a good attempt
[23490.06s -> 23494.14s]  Is it what so the ghost move I somehow dodged every single one?
[23494.30s -> 23495.68s]  I don't even know how I did it
[23495.68s -> 23497.20s]  She attacked me with every single one
[23497.20s -> 23501.60s]  It's just the pillars were in the way and I had no idea when she was casting it. You were in the flow state
[23501.84s -> 23504.46s]  You hit trance
[23504.46s -> 23507.82s]  You know what i'm saying? I thought we had it there
[23508.64s -> 23513.44s]  I know what you're thinking, but it's probably whatever you're trying to say skip the ladder all together
[23516.09s -> 23527.29s]  Actually, probably a good idea
[23527.29s -> 23530.57s]  I do have the boiled crabs. I feel like it's time to we got to use these
[23531.37s -> 23537.53s]  We picked up I used one that fight. We just we picked up so much random shit like it's um, how do you even remember?
[23538.91s -> 23543.07s]  I guess i'll put them on the bar
[23543.07s -> 23545.04s]  uh
[23545.04s -> 23553.15s]  Okay
[23553.15s -> 23559.71s]  I tried to hit b to back out of the menu and you saw it happen next. Yeah, you know naturally that's naturally that's how it happens
[23560.59s -> 23562.59s]  You just you know, you're pressing b
[23562.75s -> 23584.32s]  Can I get one of those heels when I get back up?
[23586.14s -> 23603.45s]  Sure, all right. Let me actually put them on the bar because i'll use them and I'd eat them both at the same time
[23610.06s -> 23617.16s]  Okay, I have been using my wondrous disease
[23620.62s -> 23641.77s]  Remember the one I was gonna go. I was gonna go as long as it took. Do you want some crabs and
[23642.49s -> 23648.92s]  Whatever. These are do you want some? Uh, I don't think I need them. I uh, I already had, you know the whole eating, you know
[23649.88s -> 23651.34s]  Are they raw?
[23651.34s -> 23653.74s]  No, they're boiled. Let's go. I don't want I don't want them
[23658.70s -> 23660.80s]  Melania
[23660.80s -> 23662.80s]  It's time for you to pay
[23662.80s -> 23693.77s]  That was unfortunate, but
[23693.77s -> 23696.01s]  My game was lagging so bad during that. I was worried
[23711.48s -> 23714.94s]  Oh my god
[23714.94s -> 23718.06s]  Thank you. Yeah, that might have just saved me. I was just so
[23719.18s -> 23722.54s]  I'm so desperately trying to make it so you all right. I don't want to die here
[23723.90s -> 23725.34s]  Okay, i'm coming
[23725.34s -> 23727.31s]  Oh god
[23727.31s -> 23737.63s]  She turned around to do it to you. I need a second. I'm not with you
[23738.19s -> 23740.19s]  All right, be aware of that
[23750.73s -> 23766.91s]  Oh fuck
[23766.91s -> 23782.62s]  Nice one
[23782.62s -> 23787.69s]  She went down
[23787.69s -> 23789.85s]  Get her. Okay. All right. All right. Heal up
[23790.49s -> 23792.49s]  Heal up and get ready. Heal up and get ready
[23797.40s -> 23804.17s]  What wait? I don't she needs one hit
[23807.39s -> 23810.81s]  Yes
[23810.81s -> 23812.89s]  Okay, uh, I don't have any mana for
[23813.61s -> 23815.55s]  repeal
[23815.55s -> 23817.55s]  What the heck I dodged it quiet
[23823.26s -> 23826.06s]  Let's show her why we're the actual rot boys
[23838.24s -> 23840.32s]  I'm covered in rot. I'm covered in rot. It's bad
[23841.04s -> 23842.72s]  It's real bad
[23842.72s -> 23868.64s]  I'm all right. I'm just eating food over here. I'm buying time for you. I'm not let's go
[23869.44s -> 23895.87s]  I would expect the shadows. Yep
[23897.20s -> 23899.20s]  She's chasing you hard. Yeah, there she goes
[23900.06s -> 23902.06s]  You just run far enough away. It won't get you
[23902.30s -> 23918.62s]  I don't think that's accurate though
[23918.62s -> 23934.64s]  I can't see shit. Where am I? Yeah same god damn it lock on
[23938.52s -> 23940.52s]  Oh, she's doing this bullshit again
[23941.48s -> 23951.40s]  She should full heal during that
[23960.43s -> 23964.11s]  Oh, no, I didn't know that's what she was doing. I thought she was going towards you with the
[23964.83s -> 23966.83s]  Oh, man, I didn't know she was doing that
[23967.80s -> 23972.30s]  Fuck. I thought she was doing the thing. She puts the sword in the ground. It does the explosion
[23973.10s -> 23979.72s]  Well, good luck
[23979.72s -> 23995.95s]  Whoa, wow, what the fuck that's what I thought she was doing
[23996.67s -> 23998.67s]  Always assume it's waterfowl. I also
[23999.07s -> 24001.07s]  She was aiming at stir figured I could get in there
[24001.79s -> 24007.61s]  I got no more heals. This is it. Yes. No, I got one more. This is rough
[24011.32s -> 24013.32s]  She's she's just healed
[24030.20s -> 24032.36s]  The l2 is insane damage
[24032.36s -> 24032.68s]  Yeah
[24032.68s -> 24038.04s]  I just I did it once and I must have pressed it again because I did the second part and I really didn't want to and that's
[24038.04s -> 24059.45s]  More kind of fell apart for me. That was a really good attempt though. It's unfortunate
[24062.27s -> 24063.23s]  Yeah
[24063.23s -> 24068.51s]  Or should I have like any other weapon for this? I have a dagger that reduces max hp. What do you mean?
[24069.76s -> 24072.08s]  Didn't you have some like fully upgraded faith sword?
[24072.88s -> 24075.12s]  Wait, i'm not even faith. Never mind. What is this?
[24087.15s -> 24093.61s]  What do you mean?
[24093.61s -> 24127.24s]  I use this this is good with no upgrades. No, this is just gonna have to come down to us being gamers. I think
[24132.54s -> 24136.94s]  Is it a debuff? I mean, I I don't there's no harm in me keeping it on I could try it see what it does
[24137.50s -> 24148.12s]  I'll try it. I went the wrong way. All right, I will tell you i'm getting a little bit of gamer fatigue
[24149.08s -> 24151.56s]  A little bit of gamer fatigue. I'm getting a little bit of gamer fatigue
[24152.28s -> 24154.84s]  And that's understandable that was just unfortunate what just happened
[24155.32s -> 24157.40s]  I mean, it's like it's fine because we're gonna win this one
[24167.15s -> 24169.15s]  Make sure that guy with the spear on the stairs
[24169.79s -> 24173.55s]  Can you please just like walk a little bit further? I did
[24174.91s -> 24179.07s]  I did this fucking worms in you dude. You are you are gamer fatigued
[24190.44s -> 24192.44s]  Wait, it's not yes. Not you
[24193.10s -> 24194.14s]  we're
[24194.14s -> 24199.08s]  What we're what the fuck I was doing a thing where I was gonna come back down and bow to you
[24202.03s -> 24204.40s]  All this too, right?
[24204.40s -> 24214.22s]  Wow, that's a big heal. Why is that so bad? How much faith do you have?
[24215.95s -> 24217.95s]  I have the arcane scaling
[24218.11s -> 24220.75s]  Oh
[24220.75s -> 24222.75s]  I think told that that would work
[24231.08s -> 24233.08s]  Arcane doesn't enhance faith incantations
[24233.72s -> 24239.48s]  Okay. Well, I feel like I was asking a lot of a lot of people said yes. Okay, let's see what happens here
[24244.24s -> 24245.92s]  Holy shit
[24245.92s -> 24247.92s]  Um, excuse me
[24256.40s -> 24260.00s]  You wait a minute you mean to tell me I could just sit back and just do that
[24260.72s -> 24267.05s]  Oh, you got like the moog sword
[24268.16s -> 24270.16s]  It's just doing this weird like dot
[24270.72s -> 24276.24s]  How long does it last?
[24276.24s -> 24278.24s]  Holy shit. That thing is fucking disgusting
[24279.82s -> 24281.66s]  Okay. Well, I didn't that's cool
[24281.66s -> 24282.86s]  full weapon
[24282.86s -> 24294.57s]  She might go sicko mode soon
[24294.65s -> 24312.03s]  I would expect it
[24312.03s -> 24314.59s]  Give her her space. She needs her space
[24322.11s -> 24331.71s]  Holy shit
[24331.71s -> 24333.71s]  I expect it like right now
[24333.71s -> 24355.26s]  I can't believe she hasn't done it
[24355.34s -> 24371.77s]  Oh my god
[24371.77s -> 24377.21s]  What chat doesn't understand is that she's also god-skinned. All right, here she comes. Oh my fucking god
[24379.90s -> 24381.66s]  Okay
[24381.66s -> 24383.34s]  That's um
[24383.34s -> 24406.57s]  That's a full sprint
[24407.29s -> 24408.49s]  Fuck
[24408.49s -> 24414.33s]  This sucks. It's so fucking hard. I remember hating this just as much as I did before on the regular game
[24415.37s -> 24419.13s]  Delete this delete this character from the game delete this character
[24424.01s -> 24426.51s]  Uh, I can upgrade the dagger
[24429.05s -> 24431.05s]  I really need to switch off faith
[24431.13s -> 24437.90s]  I it was it was a bad call. What does this scale with?
[24441.42s -> 24443.42s]  It's it's just faith index
[24446.88s -> 24448.88s]  Try just go pump this up like crazy
[24460.28s -> 24466.04s]  Uh people how much faith do you have? It's you have arcane. Don't you I have like 50 arcane
[24466.36s -> 24468.36s]  Yeah, so that way this wouldn't work with you
[24468.52s -> 24472.00s]  I'm gonna go upgrade this thing
[24472.00s -> 24473.12s]  And i'm gonna
[24473.12s -> 24474.48s]  You know what?
[24474.48s -> 24476.48s]  Desperate times desperate measures
[24476.56s -> 24480.48s]  Here's what we're doing i'm gonna just take a shitload of mana potions i'm gonna go upgrade the knife
[24481.04s -> 24484.08s]  And i'm just gonna be a coward dot loser
[24488.57s -> 24493.21s]  Okay, i'm gonna go respect back to magic and get my glintstone pebble on because it actually did damage
[24498.36s -> 24500.20s]  I need souls though
[24500.20s -> 24506.11s]  I could probably sell some shit. I also thought we picked up the uh
[24507.21s -> 24512.94s]  Like the blast ray whatever and I got excited but I I don't see it in my inventory
[24513.66s -> 24523.98s]  I don't know. Well, I don't have to fight this. Okay, this is kind of your tiring
[24525.18s -> 24527.18s]  Yeah, i'm getting the same thing
[24528.40s -> 24530.40s]  Oh, it's so spooky
[24538.25s -> 24541.00s]  Okay, so
[24541.98s -> 24543.98s]  How much better it'll be when it's leveled up
[24613.36s -> 24645.42s]  All right 480 I don't care doesn't upgrade the dot do not do this upgrading the dagger does not increase the dot
[24650.99s -> 24654.51s]  Come on Miyazaki why did everybody let me do this?
[24657.52s -> 24659.52s]  Wait, they told you the faith stuff scales
[24660.24s -> 24663.12s]  Wrong like afterwards. I thought the l2 was gonna
[24663.84s -> 24666.20s]  I feel like everybody was right, dude
[24669.12s -> 24672.70s]  Maybe i'll use this weapon frick
[24680.19s -> 24682.19s]  Well, uh, never mind
[24682.19s -> 24687.12s]  I'm ready
[24687.12s -> 24689.12s]  The l2 will stun lock millennia
[24689.44s -> 24695.74s]  That's true, but I can only do it a few times before I need to drink and then I might just die. That's right
[24700.49s -> 24701.93s]  Oh frick
[24701.93s -> 24704.70s]  Bleed is really strong against millennia. Yeah
[24705.50s -> 24707.88s]  What is this?
[24707.88s -> 24710.68s]  Weapon that I have big what is this thing? Is this bleed?
[24712.59s -> 24714.03s]  Now it's fire
[24714.03s -> 24718.92s]  Do I have a bleed weapon?
[24718.92s -> 24727.24s]  What a bleed dagger in your other hand
[24731.02s -> 24735.34s]  I don't know if I even have one
[24735.34s -> 24740.27s]  scarlet rob
[24740.27s -> 24742.09s]  um
[24742.09s -> 24744.25s]  This thing does it's not too slow though
[24747.66s -> 24751.45s]  This would be great
[24751.45s -> 24753.45s]  I could do a wheel
[24753.51s -> 24759.34s]  Respec a real one. I'm gonna go respect
[24759.74s -> 24767.80s]  How many of those tears do I have?
[24767.80s -> 24770.17s]  Just because I this is a really dumb idea
[24773.71s -> 24784.96s]  I have one I really thought I got the laser beam
[24785.76s -> 24791.82s]  I'm doing it. I'm gonna have to live with my what I do here
[24792.94s -> 24799.37s]  I'm doing it. You have rivers of blood. I sold rivers of blood for a joke because I said look what i'm doing to the op item
[24799.93s -> 24806.30s]  Is it thy wish?
[24806.30s -> 24808.30s]  Oh, hold on. I would but
[24815.69s -> 24818.92s]  Is this standard?
[24818.92s -> 24820.92s]  upgrades stones
[24820.92s -> 24831.48s]  Is it somber?
[24831.48s -> 24835.16s]  I have one two, three, four five six seven eight. Okay
[24836.12s -> 24838.46s]  I can do it. I can get update. I mean uh plus nine
[24839.10s -> 24840.60s]  Or plus eight
[24840.60s -> 24849.87s]  Why do you keep play this game? It's taking you like a year to complete it
[24850.43s -> 24854.91s]  my friend
[24854.91s -> 24856.83s]  That we're doing a random. I
[24856.83s -> 24858.75s]  You you you responded
[24858.75s -> 24861.98s]  um
[24861.98s -> 24864.81s]  Uh, uh, geez, um
[24866.44s -> 24868.28s]  Oh geez
[24868.28s -> 24872.76s]  Does this scale more with strength or dex probably strength? I would imagine 28 18. Okay
[24875.31s -> 24877.31s]  Oh, yeah, I forgot that I had the true counter
[24878.38s -> 24926.00s]  We win now need arcane
[24929.82s -> 24931.87s]  No, I don't
[24931.87s -> 24937.56s]  No, the thing already has 70 bleed. It's quality scaling
[24942.14s -> 24948.67s]  Was that all right? No, no arcane
[24953.55s -> 24955.95s]  Did I put the other two in so I do 22 or?
[24956.73s -> 24960.81s]  37
[24960.81s -> 24975.92s]  Go like 30 27. It's quality scaling. Then this is fine, right?
[24976.56s -> 24982.12s]  It scales d and both
[24986.96s -> 24999.23s]  You're so fucked dude the dagger you dumbass I
[24999.79s -> 25002.59s]  We're not we're going for a new strategy. I'm going for just pizza cutter
[25003.23s -> 25007.69s]  To see when it's okay. So then this is yeah, this is fine

[25448.75s -> 25450.91s]  After seeing that well, I wish us the best of luck
[25453.76s -> 25456.16s]  Coming. Yeah, I just I don't even know what the move set is
[25459.72s -> 25464.65s]  Neither does she
[25464.65s -> 25466.65s]  Look at how much more health I have though
[25467.13s -> 25470.27s]  Oh my god
[25473.63s -> 25475.63s]  I do miss the uh
[25476.59s -> 25493.80s]  I think i'm gonna have time to calm it as well
[25494.44s -> 25497.92s]  Oh, I don't even have mana. I didn't get myself mana potions
[25506.32s -> 25507.68s]  Exeter's hat
[25507.68s -> 25510.32s]  What about my hat?
[25510.32s -> 25523.39s]  Uh who wore it best?
[25523.39s -> 25525.95s]  You want to go again or with like what's going on here? I'm fine
[25534.17s -> 25535.85s]  I've
[25535.85s -> 25537.85s]  Haven't fought this boss before
[25553.42s -> 25555.42s]  Maybe our worst attempt yet
[25564.51s -> 25573.85s]  Just keep her in the corner
[25574.09s -> 25580.35s]  i'm dead
[25580.35s -> 25581.95s]  Surely it gets better
[25581.95s -> 25585.29s]  This thing's fucking awful. This thing is bad
[25602.20s -> 25604.20s]  I want her to heal
[25614.89s -> 25618.22s]  Yeah, I expected it to deal like
[25618.30s -> 25643.20s]  Damage, uh, I don't have any more larval tears. We said this was horrible. Well, okay. Hold on. I feel like this would be really good
[25644.16s -> 25646.27s]  If we could coordinate it
[25646.27s -> 25651.15s]  So like I go in there and I just start like grind grind grind grind grind grind grind and you can just get in there and just
[25651.47s -> 25653.47s]  Attack with all your most powerful moves
[25655.87s -> 25657.87s]  You grind her and I common azor
[25659.26s -> 25660.56s]  I mean
[25660.56s -> 25661.92s]  I wish you had it
[25661.92s -> 25663.76s]  I do you do
[25663.76s -> 25667.36s]  Yeah, I mean we could try to be just wacky
[25668.24s -> 25670.40s]  I I don't think it's gonna do that much. My staff isn't
[25670.96s -> 25677.74s]  Upgraded as much
[25681.90s -> 25685.36s]  Watch out bad guys
[25685.36s -> 25686.96s]  Let's get in the vader
[25686.96s -> 25695.47s]  What if we just like hit her?
[25696.35s -> 25698.11s]  Maybe that would work too
[25698.11s -> 25705.15s]  This thing does pretty good damage though
[25706.94s -> 25709.10s]  I was doing like a 1100 to swing right there
[25709.82s -> 25714.41s]  All right, let's go for it. I think it's a little slower than the thing I was using before
[25727.63s -> 25729.87s]  Dude, all right. Okay
[25731.40s -> 25733.40s]  Not bad not bad
[25733.96s -> 25739.72s]  Fucking god. Damn it
[25742.32s -> 25745.36s]  I had a aneurysm and forgot how to switch to my shield
[25746.32s -> 25757.23s]  I can't if you have to sprint away during that move
[25783.98s -> 25785.98s]  Don't laugh i'm doing all right
[25785.98s -> 25788.78s]  You're grinding her off. She's just like fucking punching you in the face
[25796.62s -> 25798.62s]  It's a lot. It's just a lot of stamina
[25798.86s -> 25801.90s]  Is that okay if you were alive, but we put it up with pretty good
[25802.70s -> 25804.30s]  I messed up bad
[25804.30s -> 25810.11s]  I had a goof moment
[25810.11s -> 25812.27s]  Like for like a brief second when she went up in the air
[25812.27s -> 25818.60s]  I could feel that I was in the matrix and I kind of doubted the reality. Yeah the
[25819.32s -> 25822.12s]  The l2 is not really can I do any moves from l2?
[25822.76s -> 25830.84s]  I wonder let me check
[25830.84s -> 25836.54s]  You cannot
[25836.54s -> 25840.62s]  Why everybody does that anytime you like look down to look at something down your like sure to you touch your eyes
[25840.62s -> 25845.32s]  You just everybody goes
[25845.32s -> 25865.79s]  Why?
[25865.79s -> 25868.89s]  What was that?
[25868.89s -> 25871.07s]  What is what?
[25871.07s -> 25873.39s]  They just like make up new enemies down here
[25874.97s -> 25876.33s]  i'm dead
[25876.33s -> 25901.23s]  What is that dog? Is he up there coming boss? Hopefully this time the sky like doesn't fall on me
[25909.34s -> 25911.34s]  Use the black knife. I don't think I can anymore
[25911.34s -> 25915.82s]  I needed 18 faith which eight points to be able to do that one move is I don't think it's worth it
[25929.44s -> 25931.04s]  Keep her in the corner
[25931.04s -> 25934.59s]  There's a closer bonfire. Yeah, i've heard people say that
[25935.39s -> 25937.55s]  But we're in we're in gamer fatigue mode right now
[25937.55s -> 25940.27s]  I don't think you can you wouldn't be able to direct us to where we need to go
[25946.96s -> 25956.96s]  That guy is sick of getting killed. He's left over the bridge
[25957.76s -> 25960.06s]  Maybe we'll give it a look
[25976.78s -> 25981.26s]  That was not worth the man. Not really, but it was very good knockback
[25988.54s -> 25990.54s]  Oh, that's fucking fantastic
[26008.57s -> 26010.57s]  We got our locks in we do
[26011.45s -> 26014.84s]  Okay, easy easy
[26015.16s -> 26038.89s]  I can't believe I didn't
[26039.69s -> 26040.81s]  No
[26040.81s -> 26042.33s]  No stamina
[26042.33s -> 26052.46s]  Just getting ready for the next phase
[26052.46s -> 26060.40s]  What was the stagger on that shit?
[26060.80s -> 26079.37s]  That's the first time I got hit by the second part. Oh fuck off
[26092.30s -> 26094.30s]  Stop losing fucking lock on
[26094.86s -> 26123.40s]  Come on you piece of shit
[26123.40s -> 26143.31s]  kill her
[26143.55s -> 26162.75s]  Can I do a fucking move in the fucking video game?
[26171.74s -> 26178.56s]  Dude, you just you can't even swing at her. You can't swing the fucking weapon at her
[26179.12s -> 26181.12s]  She's just constantly doing a move
[26182.78s -> 26201.12s]  Huh stamina was almost out. It's just I feel like she's just going like this. Can I play can I from software?
[26201.12s -> 26214.54s]  Can I play the game? That is the game. It's a dance
[26217.68s -> 26219.44s]  Yeah, I remember
[26219.44s -> 26222.48s]  Dude, it's a dance. Uh, well, can we just can we like
[26222.96s -> 26225.44s]  Can we do like can we fucking floss or something?
[26232.00s -> 26234.00s]  You shouldn't use this your weapons too slow
[26234.40s -> 26238.32s]  What it would just have to delete a whole class of items to play against millennia
[26250.08s -> 26253.04s]  The omen killer. I feel like the omen killer was was slower
[26256.86s -> 26266.16s]  All right last attempt last attempt before we put a new seed in and delete her from the game now i'm angry
[26272.59s -> 26275.53s]  Hopefully not too angry
[26275.53s -> 26277.53s]  Not just angry enough to fucking like
[26277.85s -> 26282.84s]  Go hard. Oh, i've been hard
[26283.80s -> 26296.08s]  Uh back to one
[26301.76s -> 26307.20s]  Oh, because I don't have as much stamina or fucking health as I did before so I don't even think I can do that anymore
[26332.49s -> 26336.57s]  Sorry, sir. This is personal. No, that's cool
[26337.69s -> 26340.86s]  my bad for
[26340.86s -> 26342.16s]  Yeah
[26342.16s -> 26343.76s]  for existing
[26343.76s -> 26412.01s]  Fine. Fuck you. I thought I dodged again
[26451.29s -> 26458.86s]  But like what if we did like one more I didn't get a fair I do I she had more health than when you fucking died
[26459.26s -> 26463.42s]  I fought her for like an extra five minutes. Yeah
[26466.48s -> 26484.51s]  Yeah, you know what they say can't win them all change your weapon. It's over
[26484.83s -> 26491.05s]  I can't the only way I can change this weapon is if we randomly get another larval tear
[26492.07s -> 26497.63s]  Somewhere I have one you do. Yeah, i'm not honestly not giving up on this yet, though
[26497.71s -> 26503.53s]  I actually the bleed is really good when you get it to go off. I don't I don't I think it's okay
[26503.69s -> 26508.49s]  I don't hate it that went real quick from if we had a larval tear to
[26509.45s -> 26510.84s]  No
[26510.84s -> 26514.27s]  It's really not that bad
[26514.27s -> 26516.27s]  Stagger is good anything out of this helmet
[26516.83s -> 26519.79s]  I I fucked up my respect because I have less health and less stamina
[26520.43s -> 26522.25s]  it's just well I
[26522.25s -> 26523.21s]  got
[26523.21s -> 26528.09s]  Shit on a lot quicker than I thought I was I just want to smoke weed with the better chaos like I just
[26529.02s -> 26558.73s]  Really want that
[26558.73s -> 26565.21s]  There you go. Yeah, let's go. Let's go and the bleed to play an extra safe play safe
[26566.32s -> 26568.32s]  Yep, exactly why we just did that
[26570.24s -> 26573.20s]  I got caught on a fucking you're good. You're good. You're good. You're good
[26573.20s -> 26575.76s]  No, you're good. You're good. You're good. You're good. Everything's all good, man. We're good
[26576.64s -> 26615.07s]  Could do it again soon
[26615.07s -> 26618.57s]  Yeah
[26618.57s -> 26622.96s]  Good very clean so clean well diddled
[26633.61s -> 26641.18s]  sucks losing the
[26641.18s -> 26668.03s]  nice
[26668.03s -> 26687.58s]  Paranoid all right eat whatever you got eat whatever you got. No i'm in the run. I'm in the run. I'm coming out here
[26688.06s -> 26694.30s]  Well, that doesn't reach
[26694.30s -> 26696.06s]  No
[26696.06s -> 26707.80s]  I'm gonna die. That's fine. She won't leave me alone
[26708.44s -> 26713.07s]  I mean, I I have rotten she puts it was in the worst possible spot
[26714.75s -> 26718.14s]  No, it's over man
[26718.14s -> 26721.66s]  as she landed I dodged it and I was just in it I was trying to get away from her because of
[26724.92s -> 26727.00s]  Oh, this is such fucking hell in this room
[26727.72s -> 26745.44s]  That was a really good first run
[26745.52s -> 26752.92s]  It's just the second round is just it's just like fuck. I mean you didn't really even get to do the second round. No
[26754.32s -> 26759.07s]  You walked back into it. I know but it's like it's just i'm trying to get away and
[26759.39s -> 26762.99s]  At the uh at the cross of the church if you go into those like big extra areas
[26763.07s -> 26766.43s]  She can never land on you if like we're close enough. We weren't really
[26767.39s -> 26768.27s]  I just
[26768.27s -> 26773.63s]  It's so hell bent on eating that I just forgot I did it was like it was just like I just forgot
[26774.27s -> 26778.27s]  That this is the worst boss they've ever fucking made and that's just hungry
[26779.15s -> 26782.19s]  I just forget I forget sometimes this is the shittiest thing they've ever created
[26783.15s -> 26787.47s]  I can't wait to smoke a fat fucking blunt with better chaos. I'm telling you it's gonna be so good
[26791.63s -> 26794.35s]  I don't know. I am gonna vent I am gonna vent
[26794.99s -> 26799.23s]  At the bed of chaos we're gonna be high as fuck and i'm just gonna be like, let me tell you something
[26799.95s -> 26801.95s]  Let me tell you from felania
[26817.28s -> 26818.80s]  He's venting
[26818.80s -> 26838.01s]  All right, easy
[26838.01s -> 26848.25s]  Oh, that's unfortunate
[26848.57s -> 26851.92s]  I don't even
[26851.92s -> 26855.36s]  Do it as you don't even I don't even know where the fuck I was. I was stuck on two pillars
[26856.32s -> 26875.16s]  I think i'm still old. No, never mind. I was gonna say I thought I was still in a plus one flask
[26877.79s -> 26879.79s]  What what plus is your flask gap?
[26880.44s -> 26882.41s]  uh 10
[26882.41s -> 26898.59s]  What the fuck? Oh, no, no, no, you mean how much actually healing? Yeah. Uh, let me see. I mean
[26900.62s -> 26909.10s]  Uh, anyways, it's a plus six. I have a lot more health. Yeah
[26914.33s -> 26916.99s]  Um, can you use the black knife?
[26919.34s -> 26921.85s]  Um back in
[26921.85s -> 26923.85s]  Do you have do you have any faith at all?
[26924.65s -> 26928.24s]  Nope, no, um
[26928.56s -> 26930.88s]  Only in our next attempt. Do I have faith?
[26931.90s -> 26933.74s]  All right. Let's try this one more time
[26933.74s -> 26939.24s]  Put on the lead grease just to keep it going
[26944.67s -> 26946.67s]  I don't have any lead grease
[26951.95s -> 26953.95s]  Skip her. Uh, we unfortunately
[26954.43s -> 26955.71s]  can not
[26955.71s -> 26958.32s]  And there's a bunch of other shit we could do but she kind of is
[26959.44s -> 26962.08s]  We need two great runes to go further in leyendale
[26963.26s -> 26965.26s]  Wait, there's another way in there
[26965.84s -> 26968.73s]  What's the other way?
[26968.73s -> 26971.69s]  Are you coming from like the catacombs? I think we're astell is
[26972.33s -> 26982.91s]  I don't know now. She won't drop a great room, but the game progress is through here
[26983.55s -> 26988.11s]  Because we kind of I don't know if there's any other game progress we can really do this is kind of the wall right now
[26988.83s -> 26990.51s]  uh, can you
[26990.51s -> 26997.85s]  Take tish and I drop it for you. Let's see. I cannot drop it. I don't have a lot of mana either
[26998.49s -> 27007.95s]  This is optional, but I thought there's no other aren't we kind of locked out or we can't go to the capital
[27008.67s -> 27011.37s]  I mean we could go can we even get to mog?
[27012.09s -> 27015.56s]  I think so
[27015.56s -> 27017.93s]  We could do bog maybe
[27018.01s -> 27020.57s]  Not tonight, but there's tons of shit we could do
[27021.45s -> 27023.85s]  The shit that we want to do was fast here, right?
[27032.40s -> 27056.33s]  What is she gonna do? Yeah
[27060.65s -> 27063.93s]  No, please don't do it. Oh, please
[27065.56s -> 27068.67s]  Oh, please
[27068.67s -> 27071.07s]  That's rough and you handled it like a champ. Thank you
[27072.03s -> 27077.79s]  Your chat would be parking
[27077.87s -> 27079.87s]  Positivity was I hope they are
[27099.71s -> 27100.99s]  That's rough
[27100.99s -> 27107.77s]  Careful. I sense it
[27109.95s -> 27113.63s]  There's a disturbance. I was gonna say that but I was too concentrated
[27115.31s -> 27126.17s]  What the hell did she just do whoa she's behind me
[27127.05s -> 27128.89s]  I don't know. She was there
[27128.89s -> 27131.29s]  She's definitely gonna fucking kill me
[27132.41s -> 27140.94s]  She's mad
[27140.94s -> 27167.95s]  Yeah
[27167.95s -> 27169.47s]  Okay
[27181.31s -> 27183.77s]  Camp oh she's behind the pillar for me
[27185.08s -> 27192.57s]  She's up
[27192.57s -> 27194.57s]  Oh motherfucker
[27196.12s -> 27199.32s]  Yeah, I didn't realize she was gonna instantly go for that. I thought it was the other one
[27276.97s -> 27278.97s]  The hell
[27300.33s -> 27302.33s]  Let me swing my weapon
[27317.07s -> 27320.32s]  never mind
[27320.32s -> 27324.00s]  It's I just got no I don't I think you got this
[27325.28s -> 27327.61s]  I have no heels
[27327.61s -> 27355.44s]  Do you need them? Good point. Yep, try attacking her when I swing one time
[27355.52s -> 27387.15s]  She swings five and I die you need a katana telling you this game should have a sniper rifle dude
[27387.15s -> 27403.93s]  I'm pulling the plug in like in five minutes. If only you had a faster weapon. Why do I have to play with it?
[27404.65s -> 27406.65s]  Didn't we didn't we talk didn't we argue about this?
[27407.60s -> 27411.52s]  Why can't I play with the weapon? I want to play with why do I have to play with the weapon that you're supposed to play
[27411.52s -> 27413.52s]  With to beat millennia not fair
[27414.00s -> 27419.88s]  Well, if you beat her with this weapon, then you would have beat her with a weapon
[27419.88s -> 27422.84s]  You're not supposed to use to beat her true. You just have to beat her
[27425.47s -> 27457.87s]  Like just do it
[27457.87s -> 27459.55s]  I don't like her over here
[27460.76s -> 27463.24s]  can't hide
[27463.24s -> 27465.23s]  True
[27465.23s -> 27468.91s]  And I god damn I have so little health after the respect
[27472.64s -> 27474.64s]  All right. I'm gonna find like an exploit
[27484.28s -> 27490.43s]  I I don't know be a racer. You're just a leader
[27492.59s -> 27511.84s]  Uh, i'm just gonna die
[27513.12s -> 27533.50s]  Black knife I we only have one larval tier and stirr is talking about how his build is not very good
[27533.98s -> 27536.76s]  No, mine is great. It's just I need a little more life
[27537.32s -> 27546.06s]  Uh, you can you can take it. Um, I am so scared to like you
[27547.00s -> 27549.52s]  Go back to faith
[27549.52s -> 27551.68s]  I I don't think the pizza cut is the problem. We're doing a lot of damage
[27554.80s -> 27558.16s]  All right. We're doing one more attempt. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I i'm done fucking
[27558.88s -> 27561.55s]  already left
[27562.03s -> 27572.09s]  I mean we could just go explore other dungeons to try to find a great run. I'm gonna i'm gonna goofed
[27572.75s -> 27579.92s]  You're right. Yeah, I used the the remembrance I had to get enough for a level and i'm a little bit short
[27580.40s -> 27589.72s]  Uh, I unfortunately don't have anything. I got enough. I got enough. Oh, yeah. I'm missing a lot of points
[27591.24s -> 27594.06s]  Like down 10
[27596.19s -> 27602.11s]  Put on more armor, I mean I have left this armor is heavy as shit
[27606.19s -> 27630.75s]  Disable her healing like i'll just go like full dps and you can res me
[27632.52s -> 27635.48s]  I mean the knife was really good. It was doing
[27636.36s -> 27638.99s]  Like it was just taking damage
[27641.23s -> 27642.75s]  It didn't seem good
[27642.75s -> 27644.75s]  It was but I mean
[27644.75s -> 27647.61s]  I would have to go back to faith. I really thought that bleed was gonna be really good
[27647.69s -> 27651.05s]  I mean, we're doing a lot of damage. We're getting through phase one pretty pretty much
[27651.85s -> 27657.37s]  Like 60% of the time very hard for me on this low of life and stamina to survive a waterfowl
[27658.49s -> 27667.77s]  So we absolutely could just do other stuff and level but either way, I think
[27668.49s -> 27672.09s]  Probably done it for the night. I mean i'm probably gonna eat my keyboard if we do this for like another hour
[27673.05s -> 27689.87s]  Oh risking it she going to go crazy
[27690.99s -> 27697.96s]  Oh fuck I got stuck. Oh fuck
[27700.41s -> 27702.41s]  Oh, man. Oh boy
[27703.13s -> 27706.17s]  I'm doing it again. Are you? Oh, that's not good
[27706.97s -> 27740.52s]  Two in a row look at our health. She's like back to full health. She's taking like collateral damage
[27742.67s -> 27743.87s]  Oh, yeah
[27743.87s -> 27751.87s]  I'm dead. I yeah, I we we would have to do other stuff. I I just don't have enough health
[27752.75s -> 27756.67s]  What if I beat her right now though?
[27756.75s -> 27758.75s]  I mean do it
[27759.48s -> 27791.68s]  I'm all for it
[27791.68s -> 27803.13s]  I was trying to jump
[27803.13s -> 27807.61s]  This is exactly what we did to plaster do six by the way. What do you what do you mean?
[27809.00s -> 27813.96s]  Well, we fought last to do six for like a whole night and he was destroying us and we're like, okay
[27813.96s -> 27817.64s]  Fine, let's go do other stuff and then we came back and it was like wow. This is really easy
[27818.04s -> 27821.16s]  Uh, I would rather smoke fucking three blunts with plastic do six and do this
[27832.16s -> 27834.16s]  I fucking hate this bus more than anything
[27842.70s -> 27844.16s]  All right
[27844.16s -> 27846.96s]  What do you say we cool off for a little bit and we go?
[27847.76s -> 27853.84s]  We go and do a little dungeon or something. Just just like cool off. Let's cool off in a dungeon. Let's cool off
[27854.40s -> 27857.28s]  Okay
[27857.28s -> 27858.24s]  Oh
[27858.24s -> 27864.80s]  I know some content that we can do. Mm-hmm. Uh, it's millennia. Hey, let's do six. Hold on passing
[27866.24s -> 27867.36s]  Hey
[27867.36s -> 27871.92s]  Anybody want anybody want millennia here? Yeah. No, no way. She sucks
[27872.40s -> 27873.92s]  Mm-hmm. Yeah
[27873.92s -> 27893.95s]  Button I voted you did. Yeah, we're going to limb grave tunnels. Yeah, I voted but it won't work
[27896.62s -> 27898.62s]  Can you do it right this time?
[27899.58s -> 27925.63s]  Now we're going up up take a nice little little little chill detour
[27926.19s -> 27928.83s]  The final boss is equally as hard as millennia
[27931.80s -> 27934.52s]  What is it? What have we seen this before? What are we doing?
[27935.48s -> 27938.86s]  We're doing a first dragon
[27941.10s -> 27943.10s]  Oh, this sounds pretty relaxing
[27944.48s -> 27947.77s]  Look at that big boy
[27947.77s -> 27949.53s]  Look at that big old chonker
[27949.53s -> 27954.62s]  That guy's massive
[27954.62s -> 27956.62s]  Now this is the now this is content
[27973.04s -> 27975.52s]  Ah shit, he's almost got me. Watch out
[27977.72s -> 27989.69s]  Claus beware
[27993.45s -> 27998.89s]  But
[27998.89s -> 28000.25s]  I don't think we got it
[28000.25s -> 28001.93s]  What if you dropped a great run?
[28001.93s -> 28007.13s]  I would say then that's great because we don't have to fucking play that other dumb stupid fucking part of the fucking game
[28007.45s -> 28010.01s]  Oh fucking stupid fucking goddamn fucking stupid fucking thing
[28010.97s -> 28017.23s]  Come here
[28017.23s -> 28023.88s]  He's delaying it. He's delaying
[28024.60s -> 28041.45s]  He disappeared. He's right about he went back. All right, great rune of rodan
[28042.49s -> 28054.59s]  I got uh the glaive
[28056.25s -> 28059.00s]  I didn't I didn't really get anything
[28059.08s -> 28062.60s]  That was nice dude sick. That was that's um, that felt pretty good
[28063.40s -> 28064.76s]  That was great
[28064.76s -> 28067.00s]  Okay. Wait, what about some of the jails?
[28067.56s -> 28069.16s]  I know there's a few we didn't do
[28069.16s -> 28074.59s]  There's a ton we didn't do we did like two jails in the whole game did we do this wait can we even okay?
[28075.15s -> 28082.00s]  Wait, we'll look at some jails
[28082.00s -> 28084.00s]  This is her tree over here. We didn't do
[28085.47s -> 28086.83s]  Let's go
[28086.83s -> 28088.83s]  All right. One more relaxing battle
[28091.92s -> 28094.56s]  Wait, let's turn the death road in we might get a great run
[28104.62s -> 28107.50s]  Every item is just one item the next one that next one
[28108.22s -> 28121.60s]  Wait, is he gone? No, i'm here. Oh, we're not doing hero's grave. No way
[28135.87s -> 28138.16s]  I didn't get anything
[28138.16s -> 28156.72s]  Cool. All right. What is something else we can do? All right, there's the other route that goes into lane dell
[28158.38s -> 28160.06s]  from below
[28160.06s -> 28163.52s]  Which is astel?
[28163.60s -> 28165.15s]  uh
[28165.15s -> 28169.95s]  Totally don't think we were done with nocron. We could go kill the big dragon the big sleeping dragon
[28171.92s -> 28173.92s]  Just like a free hundred something thousand souls
[28175.40s -> 28177.40s]  Also true. Let's go do that
[28177.40s -> 28179.24s]  What if he's replaced?
[28179.24s -> 28182.75s]  might be
[28182.75s -> 28185.63s]  Uh, do you get there from here? Yeah, you do. Yeah, you can get her from here
[28186.68s -> 28188.68s]  I don't know where you want. I see let's walk
[28193.42s -> 28194.46s]  stir
[28194.46s -> 28195.90s]  I've uh
[28195.90s -> 28197.90s]  Stir I got we're good
[28198.14s -> 28200.33s]  What run saved?
[28200.33s -> 28202.33s]  Actual run saved. I just got the key to the manor
[28205.04s -> 28207.04s]  I just got the key to the fucking manor
[28207.76s -> 28212.24s]  Was it at this tree? It was at the tree. I've told you to pick that up like twice you have
[28214.20s -> 28218.20s]  This fucking guy. All right, but hold on. Oh, okay. We're good. Let's keep playing
[28221.36s -> 28226.00s]  Hey, i'm gonna go turn into a death root if you there's like a tree down there and you've been getting like good items from
[28226.00s -> 28227.44s]  the trees
[28227.44s -> 28230.08s]  Let's um get him to quiet and then
[28230.80s -> 28233.23s]  Uh, let's fight this dragon
[28233.31s -> 28235.31s]  Let's get into quiet
[28236.88s -> 28237.84s]  let's
[28237.84s -> 28240.32s]  Um, I don't think i've stood up in eight hours
[28241.61s -> 28245.61s]  Yeah today like i'm surprised you didn't even ask for like a pea break or anything. Yeah, let's do that
[28245.61s -> 28248.73s]  I haven't stood up in like seven. Holy that's actually bad. What time is it?
[28249.69s -> 28256.09s]  9 30, I feel like I feel like legitimately, uh, this is gamer addiction like a gamer health alert
[28256.73s -> 28258.73s]  uh, I need to get up tomorrow and
[28260.04s -> 28261.61s]  Yeah
[28261.61s -> 28264.65s]  Hey, I got it. I could play a bit longer, but I got a proposition for you
[28265.29s -> 28267.29s]  Yeah, I know that we were gonna go tomorrow, too
[28268.41s -> 28269.63s]  but
[28269.63s -> 28272.83s]  Do you want to you want to do it on monday or tuesday instead?
[28273.92s -> 28276.36s]  That works for me. Okay
[28276.36s -> 28279.32s]  Because there's a couple things that I probably need to do tomorrow
[28280.20s -> 28281.16s]  so
[28281.16s -> 28283.05s]  probably
[28283.05s -> 28284.25s]  um
[28284.25s -> 28287.72s]  Let me just make sure I get it. All right, you want to do it on
[28289.14s -> 28290.76s]  monday
[28290.76s -> 28293.95s]  Yeah
[28293.95s -> 28296.11s]  Yeah, this is we got the key
[28297.52s -> 28300.64s]  At the very minimum before we leave let's go kill that big dragon
[28302.46s -> 28310.60s]  We're already here. No, they're dry another dragon fight. We're gonna get like rot it. This guy wants another dragon fight
[28311.55s -> 28315.36s]  We just killed the strongest dragon in the game. Well, I mean, I don't mean this one
[28315.36s -> 28317.84s]  I mean the big one but this one this one's got way too much health
[28317.92s -> 28319.92s]  Oh, oh, yeah, let's go to the big one
[28320.24s -> 28328.24s]  This guy's freaking out. He's gonna smoke weed with the bed of chaos
[28328.88s -> 28331.64s]  Yeah, I got plans
[28331.64s -> 28339.21s]  God, I fucking hate millennia. Hey. Hey, remember when we first tried elden beast
[28340.01s -> 28344.22s]  That was actually pretty good
[28344.22s -> 28347.58s]  We got uh, we got gargoyle down here if you want. I think it's a good idea
[28356.03s -> 28358.27s]  Just can you just like remember for a second when things like
[28359.55s -> 28361.55s]  When things were nice good times
[28363.40s -> 28370.12s]  Hey, i'm not having a bad time by any stretch of the idea. I just millennia just just makes me irrationally upset
[28385.52s -> 28391.68s]  I don't like this area. I'm in where like everything does 75% of my health and damage and I can't heal it in one slap
[28393.28s -> 28415.31s]  Should probably get um, the horse is feeling easier run away. He relaxed man
[28417.68s -> 28426.78s]  nice
[28426.78s -> 28428.78s]  That seer that one shot me
[28429.02s -> 28431.50s]  At the hell I was at I I goofed
[28432.30s -> 28434.51s]  Okay
[28434.51s -> 28436.51s]  Why can I not lock on anymore?
[28441.76s -> 28444.60s]  Weird can't I I cannot lock on to this enemy
[28470.52s -> 28473.80s]  Whoa, that hurts. I thought it was just like I'm angry sound
[28476.41s -> 28484.64s]  me mad
[28484.64s -> 28487.12s]  Not locking on it's driving me fucking nuts
[28487.92s -> 28495.72s]  I just couldn't lock on even off the horse. Let's go to that big dragon and then i'll level vigor
[28497.02s -> 28505.85s]  Like two or three times
[28505.85s -> 28518.49s]  Even off the horse I couldn't do it. All right, let's go kill that dragon and just take the free souls
[28519.13s -> 28521.13s]  Did you respawn at the bonfire?
[28521.61s -> 28523.05s]  I did not
[28523.05s -> 28525.13s]  Well, okay. Sometimes I forget
[28526.01s -> 28528.01s]  How long it takes you to spawn?
[28529.24s -> 28531.88s]  Okay, the big dragon is like over here, right?
[28534.33s -> 28536.33s]  I don't know. I always get lost
[28536.89s -> 28538.57s]  I think it's down here
[28538.57s -> 28541.37s]  here
[28541.37s -> 28542.81s]  Where are you going?
[28542.81s -> 28545.61s]  I don't know. I think we I think we have to go over here
[28550.30s -> 28561.95s]  That's not that sounds right
[28561.95s -> 28563.95s]  There's a bonfire down here. I know
[28570.20s -> 28576.36s]  There was a type of guy to put gold sheets on his food fun. No, no, I wouldn't why don't we just get 62 000 souls for
[28577.64s -> 28583.55s]  Uh, I I I don't know you got you got lobstered you're getting lobstered friend
[28584.96s -> 28586.96s]  Oh getting you're getting

[28595.68s -> 28605.13s]  Okay, where did you go?
[28605.13s -> 28607.08s]  I went down the hill
[28607.08s -> 28609.32s]  The dragon fell off the bridge. Holy shit
[28611.10s -> 28617.00s]  Okay, let's kill this dragon get the souls level up a couple times and then i'll see you monday
[28618.04s -> 28618.92s]  oh
[28618.92s -> 28620.12s]  Okay
[28620.12s -> 28625.84s]  What level are you?
[28625.84s -> 28626.88s]  84
[28626.88s -> 28630.30s]  Okay, we're actually pretty close. I'm a 79er
[28638.38s -> 28641.26s]  All right over here somewhere
[28642.89s -> 28646.89s]  Uh, the game fact says that a lot of people don't fight millennia until they're level 300
[28647.85s -> 28652.14s]  The worst fucking boss ever made like yeah
[28652.78s -> 28656.06s]  I would want to go in there at a level of thousand and just click just hit her once
[28656.86s -> 28668.56s]  Okay, where is this?
[28668.56s -> 28670.48s]  um, I think
[28670.48s -> 28672.40s]  He he's not here
[28672.40s -> 28674.40s]  Where are all the yeah, all the dragons are gone, too

[28711.07s -> 28712.11s]  Yeah
[28712.11s -> 28712.99s]  jail
[28712.99s -> 28715.23s]  I don't know where the fuck you are
[28715.23s -> 28721.55s]  I'm gonna say there's the castle at the top that has the uh
[28722.11s -> 28730.24s]  The dectus medallion and maybe that item is a good item. Oh, I don't know where the hell you are
[28731.12s -> 28733.12s]  Uh, i'm at jail

[28742.72s -> 28745.76s]  Oh, well, come over here man. We got some cool shit going on
[28745.84s -> 28751.92s]  You're on the other side of the fucking like chasm. Yeah, I I knew there was no dragon. That's just testing to see your
[28752.32s -> 28754.32s]  Gamer skills
[28761.21s -> 28765.13s]  Here I come here I come they're saying the dragon is not randomized
[28767.90s -> 28770.46s]  They can say that all they want but it's not there
[28771.18s -> 28785.74s]  Okay, here we go
[28785.74s -> 28787.90s]  100 there. I was just up at the fort
[28788.86s -> 28793.64s]  I hope this is easy because I have 63 000 souls
[28798.99s -> 28802.76s]  God free the battle mage
[28804.20s -> 28822.16s]  You ever just wish you could roll up into a bomb be like a roly poly
[28823.40s -> 28828.91s]  Actually be kind of cool
[28828.91s -> 28832.19s]  Like if you come across like a big hill, you're like, oh that's fine. I could just like turn into a ball
[28833.07s -> 28836.67s]  Can you hit him like it's some it's some aggro
[28837.39s -> 28840.51s]  I've been hitting him this whole time. Can you hit him like four more times?
[28848.08s -> 28850.08s]  He just really does not like you
[28850.32s -> 28854.49s]  I hope you're uh
[28854.49s -> 28856.49s]  Let them have it. Oh nice bleed
[28873.50s -> 28875.50s]  Where is this not in this front?
[28890.11s -> 28896.62s]  Oops
[28896.62s -> 28899.34s]  What's this? Wait battle mage go defroy
[28902.17s -> 28904.17s]  Wait go
[28904.33s -> 28906.68s]  I thought it was
[28906.68s -> 28912.12s]  Is that how it's spelled there? There is a god free that normally appears in one of the jails
[28912.20s -> 28914.20s]  I don't know. Maybe they call him goad free
[28916.04s -> 28920.84s]  I feel like you just made that up. Yeah, we got like the grocery store toy version of them
[28922.81s -> 28929.74s]  It's the mini boss version. Okay. Okay, cool
[28930.38s -> 28943.23s]  You should look at the cheat sheet in the randomizer files
[28944.76s -> 28946.76s]  It will tell you where some of the stuff is
[28950.68s -> 28953.88s]  Now that we have the manor key, we don't have to worry about it anymore. Not for at least a little while
[28957.18s -> 28961.18s]  Welcome to fort far off where the big dragon is
[28963.98s -> 28980.33s]  yeah, and
[28980.33s -> 28983.29s]  at the end of this we're going to get a great rune of um
[28984.41s -> 28987.55s]  a mesquite
[28987.55s -> 28989.47s]  the x-men character
[28989.47s -> 29033.95s]  Will you get away? Oh, thanks for the meat. Do you know the secret place to get the uh,
[29034.67s -> 29036.28s]  the trinket here
[29036.28s -> 29038.28s]  the secret place
[29038.60s -> 29039.48s]  No
[29039.48s -> 29047.18s]  I left when you guys discovered you needed the key watch the entire royal rumble pay-per-view
[29047.90s -> 29051.10s]  And first thing I hear when I come back is we finally have the manor key
[29053.18s -> 29054.86s]  mogues great room
[29054.86s -> 29060.30s]  Really? Actually. Yeah. Oh, thank god our next play our next time we turn this on is gonna be so much better
[29060.54s -> 29064.86s]  Which also we could get into landale now because yeah, i'm pretty sure the mod makes it two great runs to get in
[29069.20s -> 29074.00s]  That's a bit of a mogul like that's a great moment. I think it happened in the last
[29074.80s -> 29080.48s]  Five ten minutes of the stream. We spent we spent 99 percent of the stream fighting. I don't know what I just did
[29081.20s -> 29088.19s]  And then we went and did one other like side quest and like, okay, we got a great rune. That's what i'm saying
[29089.15s -> 29091.15s]  We're gonna go we're gonna like play for a day
[29091.47s -> 29096.67s]  We'll like on monday and at the end of the day at the end of the day on monday we fight malania
[29097.31s -> 29099.31s]  And it's gonna be like we're just gonna fucking
[29100.19s -> 29102.19s]  Shit down her blouse
[29110.03s -> 29115.39s]  Oh, you did the same thing I did you did the same I figured solidarity. Ah, thank you
[29116.03s -> 29117.74s]  Makes you feel better
[29117.74s -> 29124.70s]  All right. Well now that was fun
[29124.70s -> 29126.70s]  We we made a lot of progress
[29126.86s -> 29128.86s]  I actually think here's my prediction
[29129.86s -> 29130.90s]  because
[29130.90s -> 29134.18s]  We've got we've got to kill whatever is in rykar's room
[29135.65s -> 29137.92s]  And then we do the capital
[29137.92s -> 29139.92s]  We could potentially
[29140.24s -> 29142.96s]  Beat the game on monday. It's possible
[29143.94s -> 29145.94s]  Uh, I think it'd be pretty easy
[29146.66s -> 29149.54s]  because like
[29149.54s -> 29151.14s]  the only like
[29151.14s -> 29154.26s]  Terror that we have not seen is radon. Yeah
[29154.90s -> 29159.54s]  So if like the elden beast or any of those fights isn't radon
[29161.02s -> 29162.54s]  And just go fight
[29162.54s -> 29166.22s]  You know like the main quest stuff like that could be a mad soldier at this point
[29166.22s -> 29169.66s]  Who knows it really could be where the elden beast is and where horror lu is
[29170.30s -> 29173.42s]  It could just be something so simple. It could be like an ulcerated tree spirit
[29179.10s -> 29182.03s]  Yep. All right
[29182.03s -> 29184.03s]  Well, no, that was fun. Um
[29184.43s -> 29186.51s]  Millennia sucks just want to say that again
[29187.23s -> 29190.24s]  um
[29190.24s -> 29192.24s]  We'll beat her though. We will
[29193.54s -> 29195.60s]  I i'm confident
[29195.60s -> 29197.89s]  I'm also confident with like
[29197.89s -> 29199.89s]  10 more levels. I think we would
[29200.86s -> 29203.18s]  It would be so much easier with like 10 levels
[29203.82s -> 29210.13s]  It would be
[29210.21s -> 29212.48s]  Uh, right
[29212.48s -> 29217.36s]  Do not banish me yet. I know you want to but hold on. I mean you're banished
[29218.00s -> 29220.80s]  Don't do it. I'm serious because i'm about to get the treasure chest
[29222.16s -> 29224.85s]  The treasure trashed
[29224.85s -> 29229.44s]  Okay, you can ban me now
[29229.44s -> 29231.44s]  I can't believe that was actually a great run
[29241.76s -> 29243.20s]  I'm now alone
[29243.20s -> 29249.34s]  Well, we killed ryckard. We killed the weird version of ryckard. We didn't kill the actual ryckard
[29250.70s -> 29252.38s]  We killed the well we
[29252.38s -> 29254.38s]  Phase one ryckard technically
[29256.43s -> 29259.79s]  Yeah, we killed ryckard in the valiant golem
[29260.51s -> 29262.02s]  double fight
[29262.02s -> 29264.02s]  Which i'm surprised that wasn't two enemies
[29266.77s -> 29272.03s]  Yeah, I don't think I have anything else I can do
[29275.97s -> 29279.87s]  Why all there is to do
[29281.68s -> 29283.68s]  Is stand near fia's entrance
[29284.00s -> 29286.00s]  And get 10k souls
[29286.80s -> 29288.80s]  Could do that
[29288.96s -> 29292.16s]  But yeah, i'm going i'm going i'm really tired and I uh, thanks luster
[29292.88s -> 29295.12s]  I've just got some like backpack pork. Yeah
[29295.76s -> 29300.00s]  Go go relax. I feel like you have kind of a stressful last 24 hours. Go chill
[29300.74s -> 29304.93s]  Yeah, all right. We'll see you soon. We'll see you monday. Yeah, okay. Yeah
[29306.53s -> 29312.18s]  Yeah, see you monday. Yeah
[29312.18s -> 29317.58s]  All right. Yeah, that was uh, we made some pretty good progress
[29318.14s -> 29322.24s]  We were on millennia for like three hours three and a half four hours
[29324.02s -> 29326.58s]  It kind of par for the course. I think it
[29331.71s -> 29345.46s]  Before I go is anything else I can just I don't think so great stream. I didn't get too angry
[29348.06s -> 29351.58s]  I don't think I think this pales in comparison to when I actually played the real millennia
[29355.39s -> 29356.93s]  Yeah, we'll see you monday
[29356.93s -> 29361.50s]  Same thing. Maybe we'll beat it. Maybe we won't if we don't then we'll finish it up a day or two later
[29361.50s -> 29378.58s]  Imagining maybe the maybe one more weekend. Yeah, I think that's good here. I'll just call it right here. Thanks for watching
[29379.14s -> 29383.70s]  We'll see you on monday. Have a good rest of your weekend. Uh, there's still sunday left. So have a good one
[29389.20s -> 29391.20s]  and then after to after monday
[29391.84s -> 29399.12s]  Probably do a uh, I don't know. There's a lot of things I want to play monday at
[29399.68s -> 29402.56s]  Let me talk to stir probably gonna just ask them
[29403.46s -> 29411.81s]  Assume somewhere between two and three pm specific. That's where we'll probably end up in but yeah, take care
[29411.81s -> 29434.77s]  See you guys later. Uh, this stuff we still can hang out for a second. What level is my character 84 and I believe stir is 80
[29435.33s -> 29441.96s]  I'm gonna do some more chill stuff. Absolutely
[29450.00s -> 29452.96s]  Like pentament in your spare time. It's a little slow at the start
[29454.96s -> 29459.20s]  I think I actually tried it for like an hour and I it was a little too slow for me and I was like oh
[29459.20s -> 29461.73s]  This is for me
[29461.73s -> 29464.93s]  But I feel like I kind of didn't give it the right amount of time
[29465.65s -> 29476.21s]  What dead space?
[29476.21s -> 29478.21s]  I could probably play dead space
[29478.29s -> 29496.85s]  Put it on the list
[29496.85s -> 29500.85s]  Is the is the remake any good i've seen a lot of people playing it doesn't know if it's any good or not though
[29503.44s -> 29506.08s]  It sounds like I fucking smashed something in my room
[29508.45s -> 29510.69s]  This the cams off nobody can see me and i'm just like
[29513.63s -> 29515.15s]  This goddamn game
[29515.15s -> 29525.65s]  What about hi-fi rush? Hi-fi rush is i'm playing it just kind of hanging out off stream
[29529.49s -> 29531.33s]  And I will tell you it
[29531.33s -> 29534.05s]  It feels like it's going to be one of the one of the great ones this year
[29538.13s -> 29539.09s]  Yeah
[29539.09s -> 29541.49s]  Take it easy. See you guys later. See you monday. Have a great night
[29541.49s -> 29548.68s]  Take care of yourselves. See you soon. Goodbye and good night
