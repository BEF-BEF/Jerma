[1.59s -> 12.41s]  Hello again. How are you? I'm back. Those of you that were here last night,
[12.41s -> 18.84s]  sorry for the abrupt ending. Don't know what happened, but they were either doing
[18.84s -> 22.68s]  maintenance or there was some kind of accident or something. Maybe
[22.68s -> 27.48s]  potentially we don't really know. But internet abruptly just turned off
[27.48s -> 33.38s]  to the whole house and didn't come back. Came back for like 30 minutes and then
[33.38s -> 40.31s]  came went down again. So sorry about that, but we're back now.
[40.31s -> 45.34s]  Everything seems to be back in working order.
[45.34s -> 50.86s]  I hope you're having a good day so far. I'm having a good day. I'm gonna do
[50.86s -> 55.18s]  something today that I said I was gonna do a year and a
[55.18s -> 60.66s]  half ago. Just over a full year ago I said I was
[60.66s -> 65.70s]  gonna do this. We played Stuntman Ignition on a PS2
[65.70s -> 70.39s]  night. Remember that? Remember when I did all those
[70.39s -> 74.79s]  PS2 games in a row? Well Stuntman Ignition was one of them.
[74.79s -> 79.43s]  And it turns out the game looks like shit and is almost unbearable to
[79.43s -> 85.11s]  to play and look at on PS2. So I said wait there's a PS3 version. Everyone was
[85.11s -> 88.55s]  saying there's a PS3. It's way better. It's so much better graphics, better
[88.55s -> 94.66s]  handling of the cars. So I said all right I'll get the PS3
[94.66s -> 99.38s]  version. I said I was gonna do that like probably in a few weeks.
[99.38s -> 105.18s]  It's been more than a year. So Stuntman Ignition PS3 version tonight.
[105.18s -> 109.48s]  Been sitting on it for a while. Here we go.
[109.48s -> 114.14s]  Don't know how long we're gonna play this for but I figured I would do it
[114.14s -> 120.18s]  because it's here and I'm gonna do it. If this takes less than a couple hours
[120.18s -> 124.82s]  because DOS got disconnected. We had disconnected DOS last night.
[124.82s -> 129.37s]  I will just go back and we will do more of that. I might get addicted to this and
[129.37s -> 132.81s]  I might want to play this all night. I don't know.
[132.81s -> 138.71s]  I can't tell you. So if we go more than four, five, six, seven hours on Stuntman
[138.71s -> 149.48s]  Ignition which is possible. I can't predict the future. We'll see.
[149.48s -> 154.28s]  But we're here and I gotta do some. You guys, I have to do some tests
[154.28s -> 159.19s]  with you guys because it's been a long time since I've
[159.19s -> 165.75s]  connected the original Elgato HD to this computer.
[165.75s -> 171.54s]  So we're gonna see how out of sync this is.
[171.54s -> 179.82s]  You ready? There it is. So if you could do me a huge favor and let me know when
[179.82s -> 183.58s]  you hear the sounds. Well I mean you're gonna hear the music
[183.58s -> 193.77s]  but ready? So like for instance let me like turn the music off. Okay
[193.77s -> 199.54s]  so you guys hear that right? That like let me ask you a question.
[199.54s -> 212.78s]  Ready? How bad is that? Are we in sync?
[212.78s -> 221.93s]  It's fine. Is it? No way. I know I'm louder but I mean I can change that.
[222.01s -> 233.82s]  Okay so for instance. Ready? It's in sync. That's I can't even
[233.82s -> 243.24s]  believe it. Okay it's a little off but it's a little
[243.24s -> 248.20s]  late. This sound is a little late. Tell me to check this out. Let me know
[248.20s -> 258.18s]  about it. One, two, three, four. One, two, three,
[258.18s -> 266.42s]  four. Yes, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. What was that?
[266.42s -> 272.82s]  Perfect. Worse. Hey that's perfect. It's way worse.
[272.82s -> 278.26s]  The duality. Now it's worse. What about hold on.
[278.26s -> 286.70s]  Let me try one more thing. Just doing a little bit of experimentation here.
[286.70s -> 290.86s]  One, two, three, four. Ding, ding, ding, ding.
[290.86s -> 294.30s]  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[294.30s -> 305.32s]  Ding, ding, ding. One, two, three, four. Now it's worse. It was better the first
[305.32s -> 310.23s]  time. Okay, hold on. Hey, welcome to German at
[310.23s -> 319.06s]  85. I need to let me see. Can I hear this?
[319.06s -> 338.92s]  One, two, three, four. All right. Now my voice is late.
[338.92s -> 350.92s]  It's good. All right, can I mod tell me if this is good?
[350.92s -> 355.72s]  Okay, I'm just gonna play. Now that's way too loud.
[355.72s -> 371.66s]  A mod has spoken. All right, we're good. Welcome to Stuntman Ignition. Last time
[371.66s -> 374.86s]  we started the first little bit of the career. We're just
[374.86s -> 386.12s]  gonna do it. Remember this part? I did this for like an hour.
[386.12s -> 403.45s]  Remember we talked about how this was Vegeta? It's very blurry.
[403.45s -> 412.15s]  It's really low volume for me. Why is it so low for me and not for you guys?
[412.15s -> 423.91s]  Get out of the car. Get out of the car. You only got five seconds.
[423.91s -> 429.21s]  It is low. Oh, fuck. Welcome to British Columbia. We're shooting a disaster movie
[429.21s -> 431.21s]  up here, so you'll have plenty of work.
[431.21s -> 436.25s]  Pyrotechnics, burning buildings, lava raining down from the sky. Hold on.
[436.25s -> 439.93s]  I remember this. We did the first mission and then I gave up.
[439.93s -> 442.73s]  Yeah, I'll change it. I'm gonna get water.
[442.73s -> 445.85s]  I'm told this is your first time on a big set, so I'll walk you through how it
[445.85s -> 448.25s]  works. We'll have you wired up in your vehicle
[448.25s -> 451.29s]  and your coordinator will call out all the major director stunts.
[451.29s -> 455.05s]  Yeah, you gotta do what they say. You gotta land it, stick it.
[455.29s -> 459.13s]  Yellow stunt icons. These include drifts, gaps, jumps,
[459.13s -> 462.65s]  closes, and other maneuvers. I remember this shit. We'll be using a point system to
[462.65s -> 465.93s]  judge your runs. It's deja vu. It's gonna be deja vu for the first like 20 to 30
[465.93s -> 468.73s]  minutes. More precisely you perform, more points
[468.73s -> 471.37s]  you'll land. Fail a director stunt and you'll get a
[471.37s -> 475.13s]  strike. Five strikes and Richard will have to call a reshoot, which won't make
[475.13s -> 477.85s]  him happy. Once you finish a run successfully, he'll
[477.85s -> 480.81s]  look at the court and be happy. Get motion sickness.
[480.81s -> 484.01s]  Yeah, why is the cameraman doing this? If you really nail it.
[484.09s -> 487.05s]  Richard's been doing this a long time and he's well respected. You could get all
[487.05s -> 490.49s]  this from just having a wide. You don't have to zoom in on
[490.49s -> 493.77s]  everything. I'm still on with this studio. Look, it was nice to meet you. I'll see
[493.77s -> 499.48s]  you on the set. All right kid, let's get you prepped for
[499.48s -> 501.32s]  your work on this. Oh shit, I gotta zoom in and
[501.32s -> 504.84s]  go out of focus. That's what they pay me for. You'll drive four different vehicles
[504.84s -> 509.56s]  in Aftershock, an RC-1000 sports coupe, an older SUV, a dirt bike, and a fire
[509.56s -> 512.44s]  chief's patrol car. Each handles differently. He's too
[512.44s -> 517.16s]  close. You pull it back, man. So just relax. These sets are big and chaotic
[517.16s -> 521.24s]  with live explosions, projectiles. This cameraman went to the school of 20
[521.24s -> 523.64s]  year old YouTubers. Or the whole production will have to
[523.64s -> 527.32s]  stop while the crew pulls you out. We've got some great stunts planned. There's
[527.32s -> 530.04s]  a high risk sequence racing over burning rooftops
[530.04s -> 533.08s]  and a huge finale where the town gets ripped apart.
[533.08s -> 536.12s]  Before each scene, I'll give you shots of your key stunts with tips on how to
[536.12s -> 539.24s]  pull them off. So just listen to me and you'll get through this in one piece.
[539.24s -> 543.48s]  All right, I'm good. And now it's fucking loud.
[543.48s -> 547.80s]  Now it's loud again. That's just how it works. Remember, every cut scene is its
[547.80s -> 555.38s]  own full motion video rendered video that they put at a certain level.
[555.38s -> 558.66s]  Okay, all I can do is the Reign of Terror.
[558.66s -> 565.00s]  It's gonna be right for your scene. You'll double for the town's
[565.00s -> 569.24s]  troublemaking drifter in his R-3000 as he flees the volcanic eruption.
[569.24s -> 572.84s]  The center of the ramp will be this huge jump over a burning semi.
[572.84s -> 576.36s]  The key is to hit the ramp straight. That'll set you up for the stunt that
[576.36s -> 578.84s]  follows. As soon as you land, you'll have a pair
[578.84s -> 582.44s]  of precision drivers coming at you fast and you'll need to gap between them.
[582.44s -> 586.52s]  It's dangerous, so be careful. And don't be afraid of retakes. Mr. Langston's a
[586.52s -> 588.84s]  picky director and it can take a while to make him happy.
[588.84s -> 592.68s]  Driving directly into the guy. Roll tape. This is our first big setup, everyone.
[592.68s -> 595.72s]  Let's focus and start the film right. Over the jump.
[595.72s -> 598.44s]  Through the middle. Here we go.
[598.44s -> 602.92s]  Three, two, one. Action!
[602.92s -> 615.00s]  Gap the cars. God, I just, I murdered that person.
[615.00s -> 625.83s]  What's the, what's handbrake?
[629.75s -> 645.90s]  How do you drift? Oh, shit! Hold on, hold on. I need to see the
[645.90s -> 652.07s]  controls. Handbrake is O. Gas, brake, steering, right.
[652.07s -> 657.75s]  Action is triangle. Okay. Got it. It's circle. Uh, Jerma sucks thanks to the five
[657.75s -> 662.92s]  community selves. Circle is handbrake. I'm ready.
[662.92s -> 666.68s]  Three, two, one. Action!
[666.68s -> 688.55s]  Drift turn right. Turn right. What?
[688.55s -> 703.48s]  Can you seriously imagine him having a fucking
[703.48s -> 708.28s]  stunt man? You're telling him what to do as he's doing it.
[708.28s -> 711.56s]  Let's move on to the next shot. Oh, hey, you're gonna have to go, let me, come over
[711.56s -> 714.68s]  here, man. Let me talk to you for a minute. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm new.
[714.68s -> 718.28s]  I'm the new stunt driver. Yeah, come here. Uh, we need to go through the gap and the
[718.28s -> 721.64s]  car is here. Go through that and it's gonna be the take.
[721.64s -> 724.92s]  And then when he gets in the car, you fucking like strap him in,
[724.92s -> 731.42s]  lock him in the front seat. Drift turn right. Guy's like fucking screaming.
[731.42s -> 738.60s]  You have him like locked in like straight jacket style.
[738.60s -> 743.16s]  Screaming the commands and it's, you never told me any of this shit before.
[745.06s -> 749.14s]  Oh, you guys can't hear me. You can't hear what I'm saying.
[749.14s -> 751.54s]  Fuck.
[752.34s -> 768.87s]  Let's watch the replay. Ooh, almost got by that guy.
[768.87s -> 791.99s]  Nice. A guy in a mustard dress shirt. No, I kind of just said fuck that one.
[791.99s -> 798.86s]  I'm not doing that one. All right, let's keep going. New scene.
[798.86s -> 807.22s]  This next scene is a lava flow. Lava flow.
[807.30s -> 810.42s]  This is just GTA V with a cinematic camera.
[810.42s -> 813.22s]  And stunt stringing is how you rack up the big numbers.
[813.22s -> 817.38s]  That's just a regular day in GTA V. And goes into your stunt string.
[817.38s -> 820.50s]  If you perform a stunt within two seconds of another stunt,
[820.50s -> 824.74s]  that will continue your stunt string and add another number to your multiplier.
[824.74s -> 829.22s]  Now your stunt stringing. Be sure to watch your stunt indicator on the upper
[829.22s -> 831.86s]  left. It tells you what stunt you just performed
[831.86s -> 834.50s]  and how long you have until your string breaks.
[834.82s -> 836.74s]  That one's hard to do.
[843.46s -> 844.74s]  String them.
[857.54s -> 858.74s]  Fifth star.
[861.86s -> 864.34s]  I'm never going to get five stars, guarantee.
[864.50s -> 868.90s]  Zero. Wait, what? Wait, hold on.
[869.86s -> 873.62s]  My total score should be zero. Is he just telling, is he making fun of me?
[873.62s -> 884.58s]  I feel like he was just talking shit. Okay, string the scene.
[884.58s -> 887.78s]  Let's go. Three, two, one, go.
[889.06s -> 894.52s]  I gotta, I gotta hold on a minute here. Is there a way that I can make this so
[894.52s -> 899.08s]  the audio, the, the, it's gotta, gotta keep it all the same level.
[899.08s -> 901.96s]  Menu volume is gonna be the, let's just do like this.
[902.52s -> 905.88s]  Everything at 60. Car volume six, right?
[905.88s -> 908.36s]  Like then everything would be the same and I can adjust it perfectly.
[909.00s -> 913.14s]  You know what I'm saying? It's the menu volume that's fucking it all up.
[913.14s -> 914.18s]  I think that's gonna be good. Let's go.
[914.90s -> 916.76s]  We all right? I think so.
[917.48s -> 934.68s]  String it. Pretty good. What's next?
[936.92s -> 942.81s]  Too early. Got it. That's not bad. That's not bad.
[942.81s -> 945.48s]  It's gonna be four step, five stars. That's good.
[946.57s -> 949.29s]  Does anyone remember when I did this the first time?
[949.85s -> 951.13s]  It took, I couldn't do this.
[953.69s -> 957.77s]  I specifically have this memory of being, of being angry at the game
[957.77s -> 963.43s]  because I could not do this. What happened?
[963.43s -> 964.63s]  I don't understand. What changed?
[966.22s -> 970.14s]  All right. Today's role will be the drifter's last scene when he tries to escape the town
[970.14s -> 972.54s]  and gets torched by a lava boulder at the end.
[972.54s -> 974.70s]  The feature stunt is the pyro charge.
[974.70s -> 977.50s]  I was not pretending. I was probably like fucking tired.
[977.50s -> 981.42s]  Which will mark on your HUD. Trigger the charge and set your car on fire.
[981.42s -> 983.50s]  It'll get hot, but you'll be wearing a cool suit.
[984.46s -> 988.14s]  Once you're lit, drift hard to the right and gap through the car wash.
[988.14s -> 991.74s]  That'll extinguish the fire. Then race on to the big finale.
[991.74s -> 994.06s]  And remember kid, watch out for that lava.
[995.45s -> 997.77s]  Yeah, but the PS2 version was like unplayable.
[997.77s -> 1000.81s]  It was like 12 frames a second at like 360p.
[1007.46s -> 1009.58s]  String it. Here we go.
[1009.58s -> 1012.30s]  Three, two, one, action.
[1015.99s -> 1017.75s]  You have to stay out of the lava.
[1020.39s -> 1023.19s]  Three, one, action.
[1042.22s -> 1048.57s]  God, that drifter is not going to be alive.
[1052.71s -> 1056.34s]  Car wash. Oh my God.
[1057.06s -> 1059.38s]  I had an instant fucking headache again.
[1059.38s -> 1061.78s]  I knew it was going to take less than five minutes.
[1061.78s -> 1065.08s]  God damn it.
[1066.28s -> 1076.65s]  Motherfucker's dead.
[1077.29s -> 1078.49s]  Motherfucker's dead.
[1081.62s -> 1088.60s]  It's a burning building.
[1088.60s -> 1089.24s]  It's horrible.
[1097.77s -> 1098.89s]  Why am I alive?
[1108.94s -> 1113.98s]  I want to see.
[1115.27s -> 1116.87s]  Ignite your vehicle for the first time.
[1117.99s -> 1119.43s]  Hot wash and hot wax.
[1119.43s -> 1120.39s]  Okay, cool.
[1121.27s -> 1122.87s]  I got a color customizer.
[1123.59s -> 1124.39s]  Very nice.
[1124.39s -> 1126.07s]  You unlock the R3000.
[1127.67s -> 1165.08s]  It's too loud.
[1167.78s -> 1176.09s]  The camera angle's bad because I killed the director.
[1176.09s -> 1176.73s]  Yeah, that's true.
[1177.85s -> 1179.69s]  Oh God, my fucking stomach hurts.
[1184.10s -> 1187.38s]  I did a pretty good job, but I contained myself pretty well here.
[1197.00s -> 1197.50s]  What?
[1199.74s -> 1201.26s]  What happened to that car?
[1202.06s -> 1203.82s]  That car just flew forward.
[1205.58s -> 1207.02s]  And then they just detonate me.
[1215.87s -> 1216.99s]  That person's not alive.
[1216.99s -> 1217.63s]  There's no way.
[1223.95s -> 1226.56s]  Okay, let's keep going.
[1232.96s -> 1234.40s]  I'm really, really...
[1234.40s -> 1237.36s]  I'm so glad I actually a year later decided to play this game.
[1239.55s -> 1241.47s]  So this is a volcano climb.
[1242.35s -> 1246.54s]  How can a game be so loud and so quiet at the same time?
[1248.52s -> 1250.76s]  Thank you Klosski for the five community subs.
[1250.76s -> 1251.26s]  Thank you.
[1253.58s -> 1254.46s]  Five subs coming up.
[1256.36s -> 1258.28s]  Let's talk motorcycles, kid.
[1258.28s -> 1262.52s]  Directors love them because they're fast and loud and add punch to any scene.
[1262.52s -> 1265.40s]  But they're also harder to control and a lot more dangerous,
[1265.40s -> 1268.76s]  so watch out or they'll be mopping your skull off the pavement.
[1268.76s -> 1271.32s]  There are two major stunts unique to the bike.
[1271.32s -> 1272.60s]  What are the unique ones?
[1272.60s -> 1276.28s]  It's a great way to start any motor run and keep your strings alive.
[1277.24s -> 1278.28s]  How do you do a wheelie?
[1278.92s -> 1279.64s]  Just pull back?
[1281.31s -> 1282.59s]  Yeah, all right, you just pull back.
[1283.71s -> 1285.15s]  Then there's the slide.
[1285.23s -> 1286.11s]  To pull it off.
[1286.11s -> 1286.67s]  Oh, nice.
[1286.67s -> 1290.11s]  Perform the action as you pass through the designated stunt box.
[1290.11s -> 1294.43s]  That'll make you lay the bike down on one side while you're still barreling forward.
[1294.43s -> 1296.59s]  That's a lot of info on the screen for just holding left.
[1297.68s -> 1298.72s]  Simple as that.
[1298.72s -> 1299.44s]  Let's see what you...
[1301.24s -> 1301.80s]  All right, let's go.
[1307.26s -> 1308.62s]  What are all the diagrams for?
[1308.62s -> 1309.34s]  Yeah, I just...
[1309.34s -> 1310.22s]  Somebody just had...
[1311.10s -> 1313.02s]  I mean, it is like a Hollywood movie studio,
[1313.02s -> 1315.74s]  so there's somebody just making slides for everything.
[1317.56s -> 1321.40s]  They make slides and like storyboards and shit for like what they eat for lunch every day.
[1321.88s -> 1322.68s]  Doesn't surprise me.
[1326.51s -> 1344.91s]  Oh, it's hard to do on the bike.
[1360.91s -> 1363.39s]  I don't know if it's going to be U-turn.
[1363.95s -> 1374.91s]  This is like when you're driving in the car with like your mother or something.
[1376.43s -> 1378.03s]  I go, can you take me to the bank?
[1379.15s -> 1380.35s]  Yeah, sure, ma.
[1380.35s -> 1381.63s]  Oh, what bank do you want to go to?
[1381.63s -> 1382.59s]  I know how to get there.
[1382.59s -> 1383.39s]  Just listen to me.
[1383.39s -> 1383.79s]  I'll tell you.
[1383.79s -> 1384.51s]  What's the...
[1384.51s -> 1385.31s]  Put it in GPS.
[1385.31s -> 1387.39s]  No, no, no, I don't need the GPS.
[1387.39s -> 1389.63s]  I don't need that fucking stupid technology.
[1390.27s -> 1392.68s]  And you get to like the turn that you need to go to,
[1392.68s -> 1394.52s]  and they're just like, oh, yeah, like when I...
[1394.52s -> 1396.76s]  When your grandfather and I used to...
[1396.76s -> 1398.92s]  We used to smoke every day and...
[1398.92s -> 1399.96s]  No, stop, stop, stop, stop!
[1400.84s -> 1405.72s]  Just tell me the address, grandma.
[1405.72s -> 1411.88s]  I can do that better.
[1416.22s -> 1422.57s]  Slide under.
[1425.18s -> 1425.50s]  Nice.
[1426.30s -> 1432.32s]  Spring, spring, spring.
[1433.28s -> 1445.74s]  What?
[1445.74s -> 1446.70s]  That was a U-turn.
[1448.32s -> 1449.20s]  I just did it.
[1450.32s -> 1450.56s]  Huh?
[1463.58s -> 1464.62s]  All right, we're good.
[1464.62s -> 1465.10s]  I got it.
[1467.15s -> 1468.03s]  No, don't play again.
[1468.03s -> 1468.51s]  Next scene.
[1469.39s -> 1482.28s]  Looks so goofy.
[1487.18s -> 1487.66s]  U-turn.
[1488.38s -> 1490.01s]  U-turn.
[1490.01s -> 1490.65s]  No, you.
[1490.65s -> 1491.21s]  No, you.
[1491.21s -> 1492.25s]  I see what you guys are doing.
[1492.97s -> 1499.40s]  There we go.
[1499.96s -> 1510.22s]  Oh, I did it.
[1511.10s -> 1519.58s]  All right, just get me out of this.
[1519.58s -> 1524.57s]  In this scene, you'll be doubling for a desperate team
[1524.57s -> 1526.89s]  racing through the carnage to rescue his grandmother
[1526.89s -> 1528.17s]  and her mountain cabin.
[1528.17s -> 1531.13s]  The key stunt begins with a jump off a downed semi
[1531.13s -> 1532.33s]  over some collapsing trees.
[1533.45s -> 1535.37s]  Keep it high speed when you land.
[1535.37s -> 1538.01s]  Then a blast will hurl a couple of cars right at you
[1538.01s -> 1539.13s]  with some serious force.
[1539.69s -> 1542.09s]  Dodge under the flying cars by sliding the bike
[1542.09s -> 1543.37s]  like we rehearsed.
[1543.37s -> 1545.21s]  After the slide, you'll move real quick
[1545.21s -> 1547.85s]  into a hard drift left, so be ready for it.
[1547.85s -> 1548.97s]  Continue up the mountain.
[1548.97s -> 1551.21s]  After that, Grandma will tell you where to go after that.
[1551.93s -> 1553.85s]  She'll tell you how to get back to Grandma's house.
[1553.85s -> 1555.77s]  Let's see that desperation in your driving.
[1563.55s -> 1579.63s]  Wait, hold on.
[1579.63s -> 1580.03s]  Hold on.
[1580.03s -> 1580.75s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[1580.75s -> 1582.03s]  Guys, I can push him over there.
[1582.03s -> 1582.83s]  Just wait a second.
[1582.83s -> 1583.47s]  This is important.
[1583.47s -> 1585.71s]  Three, two, one, action.
[1585.71s -> 1586.75s]  I gotta be quick about it, though.
[1587.79s -> 1604.86s]  Let's go get Grandma.
[1609.69s -> 1610.41s]  Close left.
[1612.19s -> 1612.83s]  Through the gap.
[1613.63s -> 1618.76s]  All right, come on.
[1618.76s -> 1619.24s]  I can hit this.
[1619.96s -> 1626.01s]  Use action.
[1627.32s -> 1627.88s]  Why?
[1627.88s -> 1629.32s]  Why would I use action there?
[1630.36s -> 1636.27s]  Come on.
[1636.99s -> 1645.40s]  All right, we got it.
[1647.88s -> 1660.32s]  We got it.
[1660.32s -> 1660.80s]  New color.
[1661.98s -> 1662.30s]  Nice.
[1662.30s -> 1663.26s]  Okay, here we go.
[1663.26s -> 1664.22s]  Let's watch that movie.
[1674.57s -> 1675.07s]  What?
[1678.38s -> 1678.88s]  No.
[1680.33s -> 1680.83s]  No.
[1689.74s -> 1690.62s]  Bad editor.
[1690.62s -> 1691.42s]  Bad editor.
[1692.14s -> 1697.72s]  That's unfortunate.
[1700.09s -> 1700.81s]  Cameraman missed it.
[1700.81s -> 1702.41s]  Well, to be fair, why would the cameraman
[1702.41s -> 1704.17s]  be filming at the crew?
[1704.17s -> 1705.21s]  There's no reason for that.
[1709.39s -> 1710.75s]  That was like a Tony Hawk rhyme.
[1710.75s -> 1712.59s]  That was way cooler than what they wanted me to do.
[1713.31s -> 1721.05s]  All right, let's keep going.
[1721.05s -> 1724.99s]  Career meant new scene.
[1731.13s -> 1734.91s]  Three, two, one, Earthshake.
[1738.84s -> 1739.34s]  What?
[1751.02s -> 1753.98s]  Can I have a suit of armor?
[1759.90s -> 1760.94s]  I have a t-shirt on.
[1770.46s -> 1771.26s]  Oh, my God.
[1773.02s -> 1775.98s]  Yeah, the budget doesn't call for anything besides a red t-shirt.
[1776.62s -> 1780.59s]  Good luck on the 180-foot fall.
[1782.36s -> 1783.00s]  Where do I go?
[1783.24s -> 1783.74s]  Action.
[1791.21s -> 1791.71s]  Get up.
[1792.25s -> 1798.72s]  Close to the explosion.
[1811.42s -> 1811.66s]  What?
[1811.66s -> 1812.38s]  Was that a jump?
[1822.24s -> 1823.45s]  All right, I got it.
[1823.45s -> 1825.21s]  I thought I had to drift here.
[1825.21s -> 1826.17s]  No, he's going to go through.
[1826.89s -> 1827.45s]  Close call.
[1828.25s -> 1833.56s]  These people, who are these other people?
[1833.56s -> 1835.24s]  I would hate to be one of these other stuntmen.
[1838.48s -> 1839.68s]  Right through the sign, right there.
[1844.46s -> 1844.96s]  Boom.
[1845.82s -> 1847.00s]  Why am I still on my...
[1847.00s -> 1848.04s]  Hard left turn.
[1848.04s -> 1857.92s]  I don't even know.
[1857.92s -> 1858.42s]  What?
[1871.68s -> 1872.18s]  You...
[1874.11s -> 1875.15s]  Come on.
[1875.23s -> 1875.71s]  U-turn.
[1876.27s -> 1876.77s]  U-turn.
[1879.96s -> 1880.68s]  Hurry, hurry, hurry.
[1888.03s -> 1888.91s]  I got it, I got it, I got it.
[1888.91s -> 1890.91s]  Three, two, one, action.
[1895.61s -> 1896.17s]  No.
[1896.17s -> 1897.05s]  God damn it.
[1897.61s -> 1907.53s]  Through the sign, right here.
[1908.33s -> 1910.76s]  And then there's another...
[1910.76s -> 1911.64s]  Where's that other jump?
[1914.60s -> 1915.08s]  Right there?
[1915.08s -> 1917.74s]  Left turn.
[1917.74s -> 1918.54s]  Damn, that's hard.
[1919.26s -> 1929.47s]  Doesn't have to be real lava.
[1930.03s -> 1932.19s]  You don't have to have real lava.
[1932.19s -> 1935.31s]  Three, one.
[1935.31s -> 1937.55s]  Doesn't need to be actual magma.
[1937.55s -> 1939.07s]  Wait, wait, how would you even get that here?
[1950.96s -> 1952.48s]  I gotta be going faster than this shit.
[1955.84s -> 1959.34s]  Right there, got it.
[1960.06s -> 1962.17s]  All right, land.
[1962.17s -> 1963.13s]  Land in the box.
[1963.13s -> 1963.69s]  In the box.
[1964.49s -> 1965.29s]  Got it.
[1965.29s -> 1969.74s]  It's that frame rate, man.
[1970.46s -> 1974.78s]  Come on.
[1974.78s -> 1975.80s]  Break through.
[1975.80s -> 1979.60s]  Use action.
[1979.60s -> 1980.80s]  Action, and then I have to drift.
[1982.11s -> 1982.61s]  U-turn.
[1985.05s -> 1985.53s]  Fuck.
[1985.53s -> 1994.01s]  That was such a shitty jump.
[2001.60s -> 2001.92s]  Why?
[2001.92s -> 2003.20s]  Get out of my fucking way.
[2003.20s -> 2004.48s]  Why would they break in front of me?
[2007.48s -> 2008.28s]  Jump the shack?
[2009.00s -> 2019.42s]  I did it, okay.
[2019.42s -> 2021.23s]  It's one star, I'm gonna laugh.
[2021.23s -> 2021.73s]  Thank God.
[2022.35s -> 2028.96s]  It's two.
[2028.96s -> 2030.32s]  Dude, that's two stars, it's all right.
[2031.04s -> 2034.59s]  We don't even need to see the replay on this one.
[2034.59s -> 2036.11s]  But we're gonna, we have to watch the replay on all of them.
[2036.75s -> 2041.39s]  Not bad.
[2042.35s -> 2045.39s]  All right, that person, that person's on fire too.
[2050.04s -> 2052.44s]  They don't even have like a head protector, mask, or anything.
[2052.44s -> 2053.16s]  Just burning.
[2053.80s -> 2061.07s]  Ooh, that was pretty dirty.
[2063.07s -> 2064.35s]  That was weird too.
[2064.35s -> 2065.23s]  Why did that speed up?
[2066.27s -> 2068.11s]  Is this going like three times speed?
[2068.11s -> 2068.83s]  What's going on here?
[2069.63s -> 2074.12s]  It's playing this EDF music.
[2074.76s -> 2081.90s]  Could've, yeah, I could use a little work.
[2082.62s -> 2088.91s]  What did I do wrong here?
[2089.55s -> 2110.70s]  This game is fucking ridiculous, I love it.
[2110.70s -> 2112.78s]  We're almost done with the first set of scenes here.
[2116.28s -> 2119.56s]  This is first tremor in the movie Aftershock.
[2120.81s -> 2123.13s]  In this scene, you're stunting for a vulcanologist
[2123.13s -> 2125.29s]  racing down the mountain to warn the authorities
[2125.29s -> 2129.05s]  that this eruption is gonna cause even more damage than everyone thinks.
[2129.05s -> 2132.25s]  With a big stunt, you'll off-road to a ramp on a hill,
[2132.25s -> 2135.69s]  take a long jump over a chasm, crash through the support beams,
[2135.69s -> 2136.73s]  and land on the bridge.
[2137.37s -> 2140.01s]  Chunks of lava have torn the bridge to hell.
[2140.01s -> 2142.89s]  So after you land, watch for a quick series of pitfalls
[2142.89s -> 2144.41s]  and make your way to the other side.
[2144.41s -> 2146.57s]  You've held your own so far on this film.
[2146.57s -> 2147.69s]  Keep it up.
[2147.69s -> 2149.37s]  Gonna have to do this a few times, I think.
[2154.01s -> 2156.08s]  I'll do my best.
[2159.52s -> 2160.24s]  Keep up the speed.
[2168.88s -> 2170.56s]  You didn't tell me that was, what the fuck?
[2171.36s -> 2179.68s]  Got it.
[2179.68s -> 2180.78s]  Not bad.
[2181.74s -> 2182.24s]  What?
[2185.40s -> 2188.73s]  Through the gap.
[2189.45s -> 2191.24s]  I don't know what to do.
[2191.88s -> 2192.76s]  I don't know what else to do.
[2192.76s -> 2193.24s]  I don't know what...
[2194.04s -> 2204.68s]  This counts like a fucking backwards...
[2208.14s -> 2209.42s]  Go backwards over it.
[2211.50s -> 2222.74s]  String it.
[2223.44s -> 2226.67s]  Through it.
[2227.61s -> 2232.51s]  I did it.
[2233.39s -> 2246.27s]  Land in the box.
[2255.07s -> 2256.51s]  No, please.
[2256.51s -> 2258.11s]  Oh, god damn it.
[2259.07s -> 2274.12s]  I'm sorry.
[2274.92s -> 2285.39s]  Take him out.
[2286.27s -> 2289.21s]  He's taking me out.
[2290.09s -> 2293.28s]  I got a minute.
[2293.28s -> 2293.84s]  I'm good.
[2293.84s -> 2294.88s]  No more mistakes.
[2308.40s -> 2310.97s]  The X is X, X, X, X, X, X.
[2310.97s -> 2312.25s]  I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[2312.25s -> 2312.75s]  I got it.
[2316.67s -> 2320.22s]  Forgot.
[2321.08s -> 2322.28s]  I forgot that happened in the beginning.
[2323.72s -> 2324.46s]  No X.
[2325.16s -> 2334.00s]  How is that not through the burning house?
[2334.96s -> 2335.60s]  I don't...
[2335.60s -> 2336.48s]  What happened?
[2336.48s -> 2338.08s]  Why is that not through the burning house?
[2349.10s -> 2349.60s]  Restart it.
[2362.27s -> 2363.79s]  This car sucks.
[2363.79s -> 2364.91s]  Give me my motorcycle.
[2379.42s -> 2379.98s]  Turn left.
[2381.18s -> 2381.68s]  Downhill.
[2382.86s -> 2383.98s]  Through the burning building.
[2386.56s -> 2387.12s]  Hard right.
[2387.76s -> 2390.73s]  Through the gap.
[2392.91s -> 2393.47s]  He's doing it.
[2399.32s -> 2400.04s]  Through the trees.
[2405.77s -> 2406.41s]  In the box.
[2409.12s -> 2412.40s]  Come on, something.
[2421.92s -> 2423.68s]  I love keep up the speed,
[2423.68s -> 2425.20s]  but it's like possible.
[2425.20s -> 2426.32s]  There's so many turns.
[2427.28s -> 2436.97s]  All right, crush through.
[2441.95s -> 2442.45s]  Ah.
[2442.51s -> 2444.59s]  We're good.
[2447.63s -> 2448.35s]  Next time, what is it?
[2449.82s -> 2450.32s]  Tell me.
[2460.59s -> 2461.63s]  Oh no.
[2461.63s -> 2462.67s]  Am I gonna make it?
[2463.47s -> 2466.38s]  I got it.
[2469.64s -> 2470.28s]  What?
[2470.28s -> 2470.92s]  There's more?
[2472.20s -> 2472.70s]  What?
[2473.24s -> 2474.67s]  What does he want me to do?
[2490.72s -> 2491.52s]  He was still...
[2492.08s -> 2493.68s]  He was sitting right here.
[2494.24s -> 2497.84s]  Why would you be 10 feet in front of where the guy lands from a huge jump?
[2499.44s -> 2507.80s]  You set the camera up and get out of the way, man.
[2508.60s -> 2513.82s]  Let's take a look.
[2514.75s -> 2515.47s]  Finished product.
[2516.11s -> 2525.26s]  I'm always in the same clothes, too.
[2526.06s -> 2529.36s]  Nailed it.
[2530.06s -> 2539.63s]  GTA V.
[2540.35s -> 2546.04s]  It's funny because this is playing GTA V online in cinematic mode.
[2549.05s -> 2552.73s]  There'll be helicopters flying around, dropping missiles, and you're driving around.
[2552.73s -> 2554.49s]  This actually is what this is like online.
[2556.99s -> 2560.43s]  Cars that have just recently exploded on every single street.
[2577.12s -> 2578.40s]  Not even a helmet on me, either.
[2579.44s -> 2582.41s]  This is a long scene.
[2583.37s -> 2587.24s]  I messed that up.
[2587.24s -> 2587.74s]  I don't know.
[2594.35s -> 2595.55s]  All the doors are open.
[2596.03s -> 2597.95s]  No, all the doors on the right side are just open.
[2605.96s -> 2606.84s]  Did they edit?
[2607.48s -> 2609.74s]  Did they edit that?
[2609.74s -> 2611.18s]  I feel like I was there for much longer.
[2621.12s -> 2621.62s]  They did.
[2623.23s -> 2624.43s]  They fixed it in post.
[2624.43s -> 2624.93s]  That's cool.
[2625.87s -> 2630.33s]  All right, that's Aftershock.
[2634.28s -> 2635.00s]  Stunt City.
[2635.64s -> 2636.60s]  Fire unlocked.
[2637.32s -> 2639.47s]  Now there's more Aftershock.
[2640.19s -> 2644.72s]  Here comes the escape.
[2644.72s -> 2645.68s]  This is the end, for sure.
[2648.14s -> 2652.14s]  This next run calls for a special stunt maneuver called the Reverse 180.
[2652.14s -> 2653.02s]  And it's a bit tricky.
[2653.02s -> 2653.58s]  Oh, no.
[2653.58s -> 2657.02s]  Let's make sure you've got it down so you're not wasting time and money on the set.
[2657.58s -> 2658.78s]  I'm gonna blow this so bad.
[2659.58s -> 2661.58s]  First, come to a complete stop.
[2661.58s -> 2663.66s]  Then hold your brake to take off in reverse.
[2664.38s -> 2668.70s]  Once you've gathered some speed, move the wheel hard all the way to one side.
[2668.70s -> 2669.82s]  That'll start your spin.
[2671.18s -> 2673.72s]  Is that talking in the background?
[2673.72s -> 2677.48s]  When it turned about 90 degrees, move the left stick in the opposite direction.
[2677.48s -> 2678.28s]  Release the brake.
[2678.28s -> 2678.76s]  Never gonna do it.
[2678.76s -> 2680.84s]  Throttle it hard to bring you through the 180.
[2680.84s -> 2681.64s]  Never gonna do it.
[2681.64s -> 2684.68s]  With the right timing, you should come out straight and fast.
[2684.68s -> 2686.04s]  And ready to hit your next mark.
[2686.68s -> 2687.72s]  All right, let's give it a go.
[2688.60s -> 2689.48s]  Okay, I'll try.
[2690.28s -> 2691.40s]  It's gonna take a few attempts.
[2695.61s -> 2697.69s]  I do this in the parking lot all the time.
[2697.69s -> 2698.25s]  Don't do that.
[2701.31s -> 2702.19s]  Absolutely don't do that.
[2702.83s -> 2703.63s]  What are you?
[2703.63s -> 2704.43s]  Don't do that shit.
[2706.76s -> 2707.72s]  All right, complete the stunt.
[2707.72s -> 2708.12s]  Let's go.
[2708.12s -> 2708.92s]  Reverse 180.
[2716.97s -> 2717.53s]  That was perfect.
[2718.17s -> 2723.45s]  How was that not correct?
[2731.93s -> 2732.33s]  I got it.
[2732.33s -> 2732.81s]  I got it.
[2732.81s -> 2733.37s]  I got this.
[2734.89s -> 2735.61s]  That's not bad.
[2735.61s -> 2736.09s]  I got this.
[2737.52s -> 2740.48s]  This is the final scene we'll be shooting for Aftershock.
[2740.48s -> 2742.48s]  We've saved the toughest for last.
[2742.48s -> 2744.48s]  You'll be doubling for the town's fire chief,
[2744.48s -> 2746.88s]  escorting some fire engines across town.
[2746.88s -> 2751.20s]  The mark he's done here is a reverse 180 on the second floor of a parking garage.
[2752.00s -> 2755.20s]  After you've whipped your car all the way around like we practiced,
[2755.20s -> 2758.16s]  you'll need to keep enough speed to crash through the barrier,
[2758.16s -> 2761.36s]  fly out of the garage, and land on the other side of the lava.
[2761.36s -> 2764.32s]  I have to actually break through this concrete barrier.
[2764.32s -> 2766.16s]  So you better give it your all.
[2766.16s -> 2768.64s]  You can't just paint a piece of cardboard gray.
[2769.36s -> 2772.00s]  I have to have enough speed to drive through the concrete.
[2781.80s -> 2782.44s]  Stay with them.
[2782.44s -> 2783.08s]  Break through the fence.
[2789.44s -> 2795.37s]  Gap the cars.
[2796.33s -> 2805.08s]  What?
[2805.08s -> 2807.80s]  He just threw a car at me.
[2816.35s -> 2818.28s]  Where's the reverse 180?
[2818.28s -> 2833.37s]  Through the building.
[2833.37s -> 2834.32s]  No, fine.
[2840.75s -> 2842.19s]  That's so dangerous.
[2842.19s -> 2843.71s]  What the fuck are you thinking?
[2844.99s -> 2846.11s]  That's insane.
[2850.78s -> 2853.58s]  Just sitting in the middle of the road with all these explosions.
[2855.88s -> 2857.72s]  I can still make it.
[2857.72s -> 2867.28s]  All right, here we go.
[2867.28s -> 2868.08s]  Here we go.
[2868.08s -> 2868.80s]  Reverse 180.
[2868.80s -> 2869.20s]  Here it comes.
[2870.52s -> 2870.76s]  What?
[2882.94s -> 2883.42s]  Second floor.
[2883.42s -> 2884.22s]  Here we go.
[2884.22s -> 2885.18s]  I got to remember how to do this.
[2885.82s -> 2890.19s]  Reverse 180.
[2893.10s -> 2896.14s]  Stop and reverse.
[2901.56s -> 2901.88s]  Got it.
[2904.62s -> 2904.86s]  What?
[2911.13s -> 2912.01s]  Bullshit.
[2912.01s -> 2912.65s]  I had that.
[2918.46s -> 2919.66s]  I did that perfectly fine.
[2919.66s -> 2922.30s]  How are you supposed to go that fast through the barricade?
[2923.10s -> 2931.23s]  I want to see this.
[2935.47s -> 2937.15s]  Imagine setting all this up for another shot.
[2937.87s -> 2938.11s]  Yeah.
[2943.02s -> 2945.74s]  This scene alone was like $175 million.
[2947.26s -> 2950.60s]  You're not just going to take it as the guy.
[2960.80s -> 2961.44s]  There he is.
[2961.44s -> 2962.00s]  He's here.
[2962.96s -> 2965.76s]  That's the moment in the Disney movie when everyone's like,
[2966.88s -> 2967.44s]  no, is he?
[2968.32s -> 2969.13s]  Where is he?
[2969.13s -> 2969.61s]  He's okay.
[2970.33s -> 2971.05s]  And he's okay.
[2971.05s -> 2972.57s]  And he comes out and like sinks with three.
[2985.92s -> 2988.16s]  All right, I don't understand what went so wrong.
[2989.12s -> 2996.97s]  Why am I in a firefighter outfit?
[2999.20s -> 3001.28s]  Wait, am I a fireman or am I a policeman?
[3002.97s -> 3003.93s]  Oh, I'm okay.
[3003.93s -> 3004.97s]  I am a firefighter.
[3005.61s -> 3017.53s]  Here it is.
[3024.99s -> 3025.39s]  Fine.
[3025.95s -> 3027.47s]  I'm fine with that.
[3027.47s -> 3028.19s]  Come on.
[3028.19s -> 3028.51s]  Really?
[3028.51s -> 3030.92s]  Three, two, one.
[3030.92s -> 3031.32s]  Action.
[3032.04s -> 3033.53s]  Break through the fence.
[3033.53s -> 3034.01s]  Do it again.
[3034.97s -> 3040.59s]  A little too fast.
[3040.59s -> 3041.79s]  I'm on two wheels right now.
[3042.99s -> 3043.63s]  Cut.
[3043.63s -> 3044.43s]  Downward.
[3044.43s -> 3044.83s]  It's not.
[3047.69s -> 3048.01s]  Shit.
[3048.01s -> 3049.69s]  Three, two, one.
[3049.69s -> 3050.01s]  Action.
[3050.89s -> 3053.15s]  I'm going too fast.
[3058.97s -> 3060.57s]  Is there a reason why I can't do this now?
[3060.57s -> 3062.17s]  I did it first try last time.
[3064.70s -> 3073.02s]  Coming up.
[3073.58s -> 3075.05s]  Frame rate.
[3075.05s -> 3076.25s]  No, I'm a liar.
[3077.05s -> 3082.11s]  No shit.
[3082.11s -> 3082.91s]  Monica, no.
[3083.63s -> 3085.79s]  See, I landed in there that time.
[3085.79s -> 3086.35s]  Did you see that?
[3086.35s -> 3088.43s]  I hit my back tires with lava and I didn't fail.
[3089.23s -> 3090.81s]  We called that bullshit.
[3096.03s -> 3096.83s]  There goes another one.
[3104.41s -> 3105.45s]  In the same spot.
[3106.09s -> 3106.81s]  Doing it again.
[3107.69s -> 3111.40s]  You think they would have learned from the last shoot.
[3111.96s -> 3118.03s]  Just be the same guy.
[3118.75s -> 3125.34s]  I'm in there.
[3126.14s -> 3131.74s]  I'm gonna get this right.
[3132.46s -> 3138.19s]  I just have to go fast enough to get over the gap.
[3139.15s -> 3145.88s]  Here we go.
[3146.52s -> 3147.71s]  Here it comes.
[3147.71s -> 3148.19s]  Here it comes.
[3148.19s -> 3148.75s]  Here it comes.
[3149.87s -> 3151.68s]  Here it comes.
[3152.32s -> 3156.99s]  Is it?
[3157.95s -> 3164.14s]  What?
[3164.14s -> 3164.54s]  What is it?
[3164.54s -> 3164.94s]  What?
[3164.94s -> 3165.90s]  What does it want me to do there?
[3166.78s -> 3168.25s]  What the fuck?
[3168.25s -> 3169.05s]  What do you mean 180?
[3169.69s -> 3174.25s]  I can't fuck anything else up.
[3176.11s -> 3193.32s]  Come on.
[3193.96s -> 3195.61s]  Through the gap.
[3195.61s -> 3196.41s]  Don't touch anything.
[3205.32s -> 3205.88s]  Got it.
[3205.88s -> 3207.18s]  Just barely.
[3210.49s -> 3211.05s]  No.
[3211.05s -> 3211.90s]  We can't.
[3212.70s -> 3216.56s]  Still two stars.
[3217.28s -> 3219.10s]  I'm okay with it.
[3219.10s -> 3219.26s]  All right.
[3219.26s -> 3220.62s]  Let's watch the actual finished product.
[3221.18s -> 3223.34s]  I know I can't skip.
[3226.25s -> 3228.33s]  People are gonna be like, oh, you don't have to do it.
[3228.33s -> 3229.13s]  Just skip it.
[3229.13s -> 3230.57s]  It's gonna be like, no skipping.
[3231.53s -> 3236.22s]  We're in 300 or more air time points.
[3236.94s -> 3241.61s]  The world's done the world.
[3241.61s -> 3242.49s]  Fire down below.
[3243.37s -> 3246.20s]  Color customizer unlocked.
[3247.00s -> 3248.60s]  Okay.
[3248.60s -> 3249.96s]  Not allowed to skip, right?
[3249.96s -> 3250.44s]  Let's see it.
[3251.08s -> 3254.03s]  Pretty good start.
[3260.92s -> 3262.28s]  You can hear the guy in there going.
[3262.60s -> 3264.20s]  God damn shit.
[3270.97s -> 3275.37s]  You see that dodge and it hit that car that was behind me and exploded.
[3276.09s -> 3282.46s]  We don't have to.
[3282.46s -> 3283.66s]  Do we watch the whole movie?
[3285.15s -> 3286.59s]  Is there any dialogue in this movie?
[3289.15s -> 3291.07s]  Or is it just these six scenes back to back?
[3295.56s -> 3296.60s]  I got this pretty well.
[3297.24s -> 3299.00s]  For the first time I've ever seen that, it was all right.
[3306.36s -> 3307.48s]  Oh, it's because I fell down.
[3307.48s -> 3307.96s]  No, I didn't.
[3312.33s -> 3314.73s]  They followed a camera guy just ran up the ramp.
[3315.45s -> 3323.61s]  That was awesome, but I didn't even get points for it.
[3324.25s -> 3335.63s]  We just need a gorilla reading a book at the end of this.
[3335.63s -> 3335.87s]  Yeah.
[3336.75s -> 3354.00s]  Here we go.
[3360.99s -> 3362.35s]  That hesitation.
[3362.35s -> 3363.55s]  That was like, what am I supposed to do?
[3363.55s -> 3367.23s]  This that hard break into no, no, I have to go forward.
[3367.87s -> 3375.82s]  I'm concentrating so intently right now because I had four strikes.
[3376.38s -> 3388.35s]  It wasn't crispy enough.
[3388.35s -> 3388.83s]  It's all right.
[3389.39s -> 3403.21s]  I was escorting the fire truck and the fire truck at the end didn't make it.
[3404.01s -> 3412.32s]  All right.
[3412.32s -> 3412.96s]  Movie.
[3412.96s -> 3414.64s]  Wait, movie trailer unlocked.
[3415.52s -> 3427.56s]  No, really?
[3427.56s -> 3428.84s]  Come on, little buddy.
[3428.84s -> 3430.68s]  There's nothing to be afraid of.
[3430.68s -> 3433.32s]  So you go into that softball tournament next Sunday.
[3433.32s -> 3447.20s]  Did you guys feel that?
[3447.20s -> 3447.92s]  That was it.
[3459.44s -> 3461.68s]  Staying here is suicide.
[3475.48s -> 3476.60s]  Try to be a hero.
[3477.48s -> 3478.68s]  Just try to stay alive.
[3489.20s -> 3492.64s]  If you'd listen to me in the first place, we'd all be safe by now.
[3492.64s -> 3494.00s]  This is not the time.
[3498.20s -> 3499.80s]  There is no more time.
[3511.52s -> 3514.70s]  Uh, is that implying that the earth is destroyed?
[3515.90s -> 3521.72s]  The best part about all that is they make you really feel like you were a part of that.
[3522.83s -> 3527.95s]  But they really only took two or three clips of me driving the straight line
[3528.99s -> 3533.34s]  because I must have been so bad that they didn't get anything cool.
[3533.90s -> 3535.34s]  They got me driving down the road.
[3540.30s -> 3541.90s]  Director intro stunt coordinator.
[3541.90s -> 3542.14s]  All right.
[3542.14s -> 3544.14s]  So, uh, we're good, right?
[3544.14s -> 3545.42s]  So I can just go.
[3545.98s -> 3546.62s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[3546.62s -> 3547.66s]  What the hell are you doing?
[3547.74s -> 3548.70s]  Aren't shot in orders.
[3548.70s -> 3552.94s]  I hope you know this next scene comes just before those weren't even my scene.
[3552.94s -> 3555.98s]  He's still trying to get out of town and up to his grandmother.
[3555.98s -> 3558.38s]  The big moment here comes early in the run.
[3558.38s -> 3561.90s]  When you take the ramp over a major drop and smashed through a burning bill.
[3561.90s -> 3562.70s]  Time to reshoot.
[3565.34s -> 3566.62s]  Do I have to go back to the menu?
[3567.50s -> 3568.22s]  Career menu.
[3568.94s -> 3569.26s]  Yeah.
[3569.26s -> 3574.56s]  Career menu director intro.
[3576.30s -> 3577.34s]  We already did this, didn't we?
[3578.14s -> 3581.10s]  Career.
[3581.66s -> 3583.12s]  Hold on.
[3583.12s -> 3583.52s]  Is that it?
[3586.88s -> 3587.36s]  Oh, all right.
[3587.36s -> 3588.48s]  I was going to say no way.
[3589.28s -> 3591.10s]  Okay.
[3591.10s -> 3594.54s]  So this is a whooping and a hollering too.
[3595.18s -> 3599.56s]  Can't speak here for a while.
[3600.36s -> 3600.76s]  Oh, yeah.
[3600.76s -> 3601.16s]  Okay.
[3601.16s -> 3603.00s]  This is this is whooping and a hollering too.
[3605.31s -> 3606.11s]  Sup, dude.
[3606.11s -> 3606.83s]  I'm the director.
[3606.83s -> 3607.55s]  Andy faction.
[3607.55s -> 3608.59s]  Andy in the house.
[3608.59s -> 3609.39s]  Whoop.
[3609.39s -> 3612.27s]  Hey, guys, this is the stunt driver.
[3612.27s -> 3613.95s]  No, you're the stunt driver, dude.
[3613.95s -> 3614.83s]  The stunt driver.
[3614.83s -> 3616.19s]  I thought you were a beard.
[3616.19s -> 3617.95s]  Guys, take these fireworks to my butt.
[3617.95s -> 3620.43s]  Jim boy's playing the lead, so you'll be doubling for him.
[3620.43s -> 3621.47s]  What's for a reality show?
[3621.47s -> 3624.11s]  We had Jim flab a bridge in his shopping cart with handcuffs on him.
[3624.11s -> 3624.91s]  Seth Rogan.
[3624.91s -> 3626.11s]  He's like chained to a goat.
[3626.11s -> 3627.07s]  That was sweet.
[3627.07s -> 3628.59s]  That goat ain't coming, man.
[3628.59s -> 3630.67s]  That's our version of stunt driving, man.
[3630.67s -> 3633.47s]  Anyway, dude, this flick's called whooping and hollering too.
[3635.23s -> 3637.55s]  Back road and cracker fest with some trouble making brothers
[3637.55s -> 3639.71s]  getting in car chases with the cops and all that kind of stuff.
[3639.71s -> 3644.43s]  You just like your trailer park family, or you just want to fight me?
[3644.43s -> 3645.15s]  I can do that one.
[3645.15s -> 3645.87s]  I can do that one.
[3645.87s -> 3647.79s]  So you got to make a killer, you know?
[3647.79s -> 3650.35s]  We've planned out some huge crazy ass stunts for you.
[3650.43s -> 3653.15s]  So any chance you get to flare it up, just do it, OK?
[3653.15s -> 3653.95s]  You just take it.
[3653.95s -> 3656.27s]  I'm not afraid to go to jail to make a poor cop.
[3656.27s -> 3657.95s]  Jim boy, put your hands on my booty.
[3657.95s -> 3658.43s]  Awesome.
[3658.43s -> 3659.23s]  That's awesome.
[3659.23s -> 3659.71s]  Yeah.
[3659.71s -> 3661.55s]  I'm trying to make a movie here, dude.
[3661.55s -> 3662.99s]  That's the coolest thing ever.
[3662.99s -> 3664.67s]  Just hit your marks, and we'll be cool.
[3664.67s -> 3665.95s]  It's good to meet you, man.
[3665.95s -> 3667.87s]  Have fun out there, and I'll see you on the set.
[3668.59s -> 3670.59s]  I don't even know where the set is.
[3673.42s -> 3675.58s]  Look, kid, this director's a clown, so we
[3675.58s -> 3678.22s]  may have to work double time to give the producers what they want.
[3678.22s -> 3678.70s]  Get up.
[3678.70s -> 3679.42s]  Of course, they signed me, Jim.
[3679.42s -> 3680.62s]  The bait, you're like a four wheeler.
[3680.62s -> 3683.66s]  We'll mostly double for the Creek boys and their signature muscle car,
[3683.66s -> 3686.54s]  the General Stewart, as they try to stop the corrupt sheriff from
[3686.54s -> 3688.46s]  foreclosing on their family's land.
[3688.46s -> 3692.06s]  You'll also have a scene on a dirt bike as your crazy brother Otis.
[3692.06s -> 3695.98s]  A fun scene is Uncle Cletus in his monster truck full of moonshine,
[3695.98s -> 3699.42s]  and a great run as a bank robber in a hijacked armored truck.
[3699.42s -> 3703.66s]  This will be your first time to shoot chase scenes, so be sure not to fall too far behind
[3703.66s -> 3706.46s]  the lead car, or we'll have to stop and reset.
[3706.46s -> 3709.82s]  Most of the action happens in the town square, but we've also got some exciting
[3709.90s -> 3712.94s]  stunts planned in the junkyard and in the lumberyard.
[3712.94s -> 3717.34s]  Baxter and his crew are all about backwoods mayhem, so I hope you're ready to
[3717.34s -> 3719.10s]  tear things up, literally.
[3720.30s -> 3720.86s]  I'm ready.
[3720.86s -> 3725.18s]  In this first scene, the Creek boys' Uncle Cletus has loaded a ton of moonshine into
[3725.18s -> 3728.22s]  his monster truck, and he's trying to escape the cops.
[3728.22s -> 3730.70s]  Big thing here are the crushing stunts.
[3730.70s -> 3735.26s]  When you see a crush icon, drive your truck over the marked car to smash it.
[3735.82s -> 3739.26s]  This is a tightly choreographed run, and if the icon turns red,
[3739.26s -> 3742.46s]  that means the car's left the shot and you've blown your chance.
[3742.46s -> 3743.26s]  It's about it.
[3743.26s -> 3744.46s]  Let's start this movie right.
[3745.02s -> 3745.50s]  All right.
[3745.50s -> 3747.90s]  Okay, let's get this freaking movie started.
[3747.90s -> 3748.40s]  Crush.
[3753.88s -> 3756.11s]  Here we go.
[3756.11s -> 3758.91s]  Three, two, one, action.
[3759.63s -> 3760.51s]  Hit the police car.
[3760.51s -> 3761.31s]  I missed.
[3761.85s -> 3762.89s]  Hit the police car.
[3762.89s -> 3767.90s]  I missed all the police cars.
[3767.90s -> 3768.78s]  Hit the police car.
[3769.58s -> 3778.83s]  No.
[3779.37s -> 3780.09s]  I got a double?
[3780.89s -> 3783.58s]  I'm gonna make it.
[3785.72s -> 3786.60s]  I actually did.
[3786.60s -> 3788.04s]  I just got nominated for an award.
[3807.31s -> 3808.11s]  I can do that better.
[3811.74s -> 3813.10s]  This movie stinks.
[3813.98s -> 3823.02s]  Movie stinks.
[3824.86s -> 3825.90s]  No, I can do that better.
[3831.13s -> 3832.41s]  One, action.
[3833.05s -> 3833.93s]  Hit the police car.
[3838.68s -> 3842.43s]  What the fuck are you doing?
[3857.42s -> 3857.92s]  Okay.
[3864.99s -> 3865.49s]  One.
[3865.49s -> 3881.97s]  Let's go get it.
[3887.63s -> 3888.59s]  Do it again, do it again, do it again.
[3888.59s -> 3889.09s]  I can do it again.
[3889.55s -> 3892.30s]  Three, one, action.
[3892.94s -> 3893.50s]  Hit the police car.
[3893.50s -> 3901.80s]  Okay.
[3901.80s -> 3902.74s]  Hit the police car.
[3902.74s -> 3903.24s]  Straight through.
[3903.94s -> 3904.58s]  Hard right.
[3904.58s -> 3906.18s]  Smash the sign.
[3906.18s -> 3907.04s]  Got it.
[3907.34s -> 3908.08s]  Hit the police car.
[3908.08s -> 3908.58s]  Hit the police car.
[3909.34s -> 3914.95s]  Hit it.
[3915.65s -> 3923.04s]  Yeah, I got it.
[3923.04s -> 3935.98s]  If you can't do it, you'll be consumed.
[3935.98s -> 3936.48s]  What?
[3936.48s -> 3936.98s]  Perfect.
[3936.98s -> 3938.83s]  Get off.
[3938.83s -> 3939.33s]  Ten.
[3939.33s -> 3940.51s]  Quick precision.
[3940.51s -> 3941.31s]  Precise.
[3944.03s -> 3944.53s]  Four stars.
[3947.79s -> 3948.29s]  I did it.
[3949.07s -> 3950.35s]  Five stars.
[3950.51s -> 3951.95s]  Threader is stringing the entire movie scene.
[3953.15s -> 3956.70s]  It's got bonus, like a five-star replay.
[3957.82s -> 3958.77s]  What does that mean?
[3959.81s -> 3970.85s]  At least it's a better cut.
[3972.13s -> 3974.85s]  I don't know.
[3983.42s -> 3985.42s]  That was pretty clean though, until we got over here.
[3986.70s -> 3988.10s]  I still snuck it in.
[3988.10s -> 3988.60s]  Ready?
[3989.46s -> 3989.96s]  Whoops.
[3991.06s -> 3991.86s]  Yeah, I still got it.
[3998.74s -> 3999.46s]  On the bike, right?
[4003.89s -> 4009.68s]  Car commercial unlocked.
[4011.14s -> 4011.64s]  Wait a minute.
[4012.20s -> 4016.04s]  Is it a car commercial that I can do in this game?
[4017.00s -> 4023.73s]  I'm looking forward to that one.
[4025.06s -> 4031.54s]  In this scene, you'll double for some bank robbers as they try to escape the Creek boys and the cops in a hijacked armored vehicle.
[4031.54s -> 4034.90s]  The challenging stunt is this double overtake near the end.
[4035.70s -> 4040.34s]  You've got to pass the police car, then thread the needle to pass the semi.
[4040.34s -> 4046.66s]  If you haven't built up enough speed, you'll smash into the semi head-on, so make sure to lay heavy on the throttle.
[4046.66s -> 4049.78s]  And remember, the more collateral damage, the better.
[4049.78s -> 4052.26s]  This game is an assault on the senses.
[4052.26s -> 4052.98s]  It really is.
[4052.98s -> 4054.74s]  It's gonna be really cool, so break it loose!
[4055.62s -> 4060.84s]  110,000 points.
[4060.84s -> 4061.34s]  One.
[4061.72s -> 4062.22s]  Action.
[4072.05s -> 4081.06s]  Ah, sorry.
[4081.06s -> 4082.26s]  Scrape the police car.
[4082.26s -> 4083.62s]  Scrape the truck.
[4083.62s -> 4089.16s]  The gap.
[4089.16s -> 4089.66s]  Yeah, yeah.
[4090.44s -> 4094.06s]  And it's better.
[4095.16s -> 4100.07s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[4100.07s -> 4100.57s]  One.
[4100.57s -> 4101.44s]  Action.
[4103.08s -> 4104.36s]  Scrape the police car.
[4105.24s -> 4110.52s]  On.
[4110.90s -> 4114.37s]  I gotta be right to the left.
[4114.37s -> 4114.87s]  Two.
[4115.11s -> 4115.61s]  One.
[4115.91s -> 4116.41s]  Action.
[4117.59s -> 4128.02s]  Hard right.
[4128.02s -> 4128.52s]  Ripped.
[4128.98s -> 4136.12s]  I still gotta-
[4136.42s -> 4136.92s]  No!
[4137.22s -> 4140.72s]  Through the gap.
[4140.72s -> 4141.42s]  Don't touch anybody.
[4141.42s -> 4141.92s]  Through the gap.
[4155.56s -> 4158.04s]  It's okay.
[4158.04s -> 4158.54s]  It's okay.
[4158.54s -> 4159.56s]  I can still finish it.
[4170.98s -> 4171.48s]  Ow.
[4173.35s -> 4175.67s]  I didn't even tell you that was gonna happen.
[4175.67s -> 4176.79s]  They just killed me.
[4186.97s -> 4189.05s]  That was driver's side.
[4189.05s -> 4190.57s]  Driver's side.
[4214.63s -> 4216.15s]  That's the scenario, I think.
[4216.79s -> 4217.91s]  It just- everything turned off.
[4220.28s -> 4223.16s]  The game freezes at a- when you are down to the level.
[4223.72s -> 4225.16s]  But that is what would happen.
[4226.12s -> 4228.22s]  I'm driving down that road and then it's off.
[4228.22s -> 4228.72s]  Everything's off.
[4229.74s -> 4242.25s]  Oh, shit.
[4242.25s -> 4243.05s]  Good job, boys.
[4252.95s -> 4253.45s]  I can't.
[4254.63s -> 4256.15s]  I'm gonna say it again.
[4256.15s -> 4256.87s]  One more time.
[4267.53s -> 4277.64s]  Yeah, that was really as if somebody spawned that truck in.
[4278.60s -> 4296.84s]  And that- I like- I might like that more than I might like the last one.
[4296.84s -> 4305.61s]  It's like a perfect cut, too.
[4307.61s -> 4310.95s]  This game is awesome.
[4317.13s -> 4317.69s]  Mail run.
[4318.65s -> 4323.75s]  Next, you'll stunt for Otis Creek, the brother with a couple screws loose.
[4323.75s -> 4327.59s]  He's taking revenge on the corrupt sheriff by disrupting his beloved
[4327.59s -> 4330.07s]  Catfish County Chicken Day Parade.
[4330.07s -> 4332.71s]  Your big stunt is an extended wheelie.
[4332.71s -> 4336.95s]  Gap between these cop cars, then one-wheel it all the way across the porch.
[4337.91s -> 4341.75s]  Then come down hot so you'll have enough speed to take this final jump.
[4341.75s -> 4343.75s]  And don't let the giant chickens distract you.
[4344.79s -> 4348.28s]  Andy, how come you always get to call out the director, dude?
[4348.28s -> 4348.92s]  Shut up!
[4348.92s -> 4349.42s]  Shut up!
[4356.76s -> 4358.36s]  There's a giant chicken.
[4361.16s -> 4390.07s]  Did I- heck, did I make it?
[4396.94s -> 4411.82s]  I'm just still concerned about the guy that just got crushed through the gap.
[4411.82s -> 4412.32s]  What?
[4413.82s -> 4414.32s]  No!
[4415.02s -> 4416.30s]  It's okay.
[4416.30s -> 4416.80s]  It's okay.
[4417.26s -> 4418.78s]  It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
[4418.78s -> 4419.98s]  Land on the semi.
[4419.98s -> 4420.48s]  No!
[4421.10s -> 4434.22s]  I thought it was gonna be on the ground.
[4434.22s -> 4435.10s]  Well, I wanna see.
[4435.10s -> 4435.90s]  Let me see what happens.
[4437.34s -> 4440.02s]  Because somehow I went- I jumped the car.
[4440.90s -> 4446.54s]  It's POV camera.
[4447.42s -> 4452.41s]  This is sped up.
[4459.88s -> 4460.60s]  Double jump.
[4464.30s -> 4471.83s]  It's gonna be like a laugh at this game.
[4471.83s -> 4473.83s]  Like, I don't even know what else to say right now.
[4474.95s -> 4496.68s]  All right, I can do it here.
[4497.72s -> 4498.36s]  Play again, let's go.
[4500.52s -> 4503.32s]  Three, two, one, action.
[4505.62s -> 4506.82s]  Don't hit the car.
[4506.82s -> 4516.17s]  I'm gonna take the left.
[4516.81s -> 4532.01s]  I hit by that fucking truck.
[4533.22s -> 4534.90s]  We both got hit.
[4534.90s -> 4536.34s]  Oh, I need to calm down.
[4536.34s -> 4536.90s]  Through the gap.
[4539.06s -> 4539.62s]  Jump the lake.
[4540.26s -> 4546.97s]  I- I can still do it.
[4546.97s -> 4548.81s]  I just don't- don't fucking- I gotta get up here.
[4550.25s -> 4550.89s]  Up on the ledge.
[4552.01s -> 4553.88s]  Oh my goodness.
[4553.88s -> 4555.56s]  Okay, then it's up here, over here.
[4558.54s -> 4567.43s]  Come on!
[4567.43s -> 4577.34s]  It's all right.
[4577.34s -> 4577.84s]  Jesus!
[4580.28s -> 4580.78s]  Really?
[4581.24s -> 4588.78s]  Okay, I'm gonna take that one.
[4589.74s -> 4592.90s]  We were filming that, right?
[4592.90s -> 4593.94s]  I want to see-
[4593.94s -> 4596.02s]  No, we both get hit by the semi at the same time.
[4596.98s -> 4604.92s]  That was brutal.
[4605.48s -> 4616.34s]  Everything was going real well up until that point.
[4616.34s -> 4634.14s]  Who was the third dead person?
[4634.70s -> 4636.46s]  There was somebody lying under the tire.
[4637.26s -> 4640.34s]  Who was the other guy?
[4643.43s -> 4644.87s]  Off the bike.
[4644.87s -> 4656.18s]  It's somebody else.
[4656.98s -> 4658.98s]  Come and get on the bike.
[4658.98s -> 4662.89s]  Another stuck man came and got on the bike and drove it away.
[4662.97s -> 4672.39s]  Okay, so two people got murdered right there and then behind the truck another stunt man was like,
[4672.39s -> 4675.19s]  oh shit, get on there and drive away with the same jacket.
[4678.81s -> 4680.81s]  Well, I need- we gotta- I want to see that again.
[4680.81s -> 4682.33s]  I need to- I wish I could slow it down.
[4684.02s -> 4685.30s]  Is that what actually happened?
[4690.49s -> 4692.17s]  So, there's two people involved here.
[4700.06s -> 4704.04s]  Here we go.
[4704.04s -> 4705.96s]  Dead!
[4705.96s -> 4707.16s]  So, where's the third person?
[4712.41s -> 4714.57s]  I can't even fucking think about that right now.
[4717.18s -> 4718.95s]  There you go.
[4718.95s -> 4721.77s]  That was a hard jump cut.
[4722.81s -> 4724.25s]  Strike Force Omega Unlocked.
[4724.25s -> 4725.61s]  All right, we're not done with this one yet.
[4726.57s -> 4731.05s]  Why wouldn't they make another one of these games?
[4733.32s -> 4734.60s]  Where's Stuntman 4?
[4735.64s -> 4737.18s]  Because I know there's one more, right?
[4739.59s -> 4743.59s]  This next run calls for a special stunt, so let me break down how it works.
[4743.59s -> 4745.83s]  It's called two-wheeling or skiing.
[4745.83s -> 4749.19s]  It's one of the trickiest maneuvers in stunt driving, but master it,
[4749.19s -> 4751.75s]  and you'll really start turning heads in the industry.
[4751.83s -> 4754.87s]  You'll begin by hitting the ramp with one side of your car.
[4754.87s -> 4757.43s]  That'll kick you up so you're riding on two wheels.
[4757.43s -> 4761.67s]  Once you're up, hold steady on the throttle and use the left stick to keep your balance.
[4761.67s -> 4766.39s]  Watch where you're going because you must two-wheel in the indicated zone to pass the stunt.
[4766.39s -> 4770.31s]  To successfully maintain your two-wheel, it's all about control.
[4770.31s -> 4772.55s]  Small adjustments will turn the vehicle.
[4772.55s -> 4775.03s]  Big adjustments will raise or lower your vehicle.
[4775.03s -> 4780.15s]  Once you're ready to come out of it, turn towards the low side or tap the E-brake to come down.
[4780.15s -> 4781.35s]  Ready to give it a try, kid?
[4782.71s -> 4783.52s]  Yeah.
[4784.70s -> 4785.18s]  I guess.
[4793.02s -> 4795.66s]  I can't believe All Might is talking to Jerma.
[4798.06s -> 4798.56s]  Yeah.
[4819.74s -> 4820.62s]  Drive on two wheels?
[4820.62s -> 4824.22s]  Oh, are you sure you didn't want me to get on the right side and slide?
[4831.62s -> 4832.82s]  No, what the fuck?
[4832.82s -> 4834.26s]  Why is it so hard to do this?
[4837.94s -> 4838.44s]  Hold on.
[4839.46s -> 4841.40s]  It just ripped over.
[4841.40s -> 4844.36s]  Three, two, one, go.
[4844.36s -> 4845.48s]  Drive on two wheels.
[4853.06s -> 4855.30s]  Dude, it's really hard to do this.
[4856.97s -> 4858.09s]  I have to be going slower.
[4858.73s -> 4861.61s]  Three, two, one, go.
[4861.61s -> 4862.65s]  Drive on two wheels.
[4867.78s -> 4868.42s]  Get down.
[4868.42s -> 4869.30s]  Get the wheel down.
[4872.38s -> 4873.58s]  This is actually really hard to do.
[4874.76s -> 4875.48s]  It's really kind of...
[4878.30s -> 4881.34s]  Three, two, one, go.
[4881.34s -> 4882.38s]  Drive on two wheels.
[4883.18s -> 4886.87s]  I mean, I just...
[4886.87s -> 4887.51s]  Let's see how...
[4887.51s -> 4888.31s]  I can't turn.
[4888.31s -> 4889.99s]  If I turn, the car starts to fall down.
[4891.03s -> 4893.56s]  And I just technically did it.
[4894.52s -> 4895.24s]  Let me do it again.
[4896.20s -> 4896.52s]  Okay.
[4896.52s -> 4901.48s]  Now you'll double for the Creek Boys, racing to City Hall to save the family farm.
[4901.48s -> 4904.68s]  Other than some two-wheeling at the top, once the wheels are in the air,
[4904.68s -> 4907.40s]  if I hit left or right stick, it like goes up or down.
[4907.40s -> 4908.44s]  And I can't turn the car.
[4909.64s -> 4913.58s]  After a left turn, come in straight and clean with a good amount of heat
[4913.58s -> 4916.46s]  so you can pull the 180 right as you pass the semi.
[4916.46s -> 4919.58s]  It'll take some practice to learn exactly where to start the drift.
[4919.58s -> 4920.94s]  So don't sweat a few retakes.
[4925.80s -> 4929.64s]  Dude, if you can nail these stunts, I will totally give you my sister's number.
[4929.64s -> 4931.16s]  Oh, go for that, dude.
[4931.16s -> 4931.48s]  Yes.
[4933.16s -> 4933.88s]  Seriously.
[4933.88s -> 4934.44s]  Nice.
[4934.44s -> 4935.32s]  I think she's Asian.
[4936.52s -> 4937.00s]  Here we go.
[4937.72s -> 4940.52s]  Three, two, one, action.
[4948.15s -> 4948.79s]  One.
[4948.79s -> 4956.22s]  Excuse me.
[4956.22s -> 4957.34s]  What's wrong here?
[4957.34s -> 4959.34s]  Three, two, one, action.
[4960.06s -> 4994.95s]  No, it's okay.
[4994.95s -> 4995.27s]  I got it.
[4995.27s -> 4995.99s]  I broke it anyways.
[5012.41s -> 5019.67s]  Two wheels.
[5019.67s -> 5026.82s]  No, not bad.
[5026.82s -> 5029.30s]  I did it first pretty much first real try.
[5029.30s -> 5039.40s]  Oh, I got in the nomination.
[5047.58s -> 5049.77s]  Let's take a look.
[5049.77s -> 5055.14s]  Two people in the car now.
[5056.10s -> 5059.86s]  I did do that pretty well.
[5060.58s -> 5062.90s]  That was, and I didn't hit a single person.
[5063.78s -> 5067.61s]  Didn't even hit that guy.
[5068.49s -> 5075.43s]  I was focused, except for that part.
[5076.15s -> 5080.54s]  I had the break for the last.
[5080.54s -> 5097.26s]  Can't wait to see the trailer for this one.
[5097.98s -> 5105.35s]  Only probably one or two more scenes, right?
[5105.35s -> 5114.09s]  I've improved.
[5114.09s -> 5116.09s]  Look at three, three, two, two, two, two.
[5116.09s -> 5117.85s]  This is five, four, three, three.
[5118.49s -> 5119.05s]  Getting better.
[5120.65s -> 5129.00s]  This next scene's a race between the Creek Boys and another redneck in his souped up hot rod.
[5129.08s -> 5131.16s]  The key is to follow the lead car.
[5131.16s -> 5132.84s]  We'll have it clearly marked.
[5132.84s -> 5136.44s]  You can't bump it too hard, can't get ahead, and can't fall too far behind.
[5137.32s -> 5142.20s]  There'll be some jumps, 180s, and other stunts where you'll lose sight of the lead, but relax.
[5142.20s -> 5146.52s]  Long as you stay the course and keep roasting your tires, you'll meet back up with it soon.
[5147.32s -> 5148.52s]  Don't get too close.
[5148.52s -> 5152.20s]  Stay close enough where you're still in the game and don't overtake them.
[5153.24s -> 5155.48s]  Pretend like you're playing your little brother in Mario Kart.
[5157.08s -> 5158.12s]  Quiet on the set, everybody.
[5159.53s -> 5163.66s]  Shut the hell egg in this movie, not suck.
[5163.66s -> 5168.49s]  All right, let's go.
[5168.49s -> 5171.53s]  Three, two, one, action.
[5171.53s -> 5172.65s]  Follow the lead vehicle.
[5173.45s -> 5174.71s]  Just need to see.
[5175.75s -> 5180.98s]  I didn't even scrape it.
[5181.78s -> 5205.98s]  That was a much better stunt than what they wanted me to do.
[5205.98s -> 5207.02s]  You can't turn.
[5207.02s -> 5231.58s]  No, you can't.
[5231.58s -> 5243.82s]  You gotta, it's gonna be the worst one.
[5243.82s -> 5245.26s]  Jump the logs.
[5245.26s -> 5246.14s]  Jump the logs.
[5248.95s -> 5250.95s]  Okay, sure.
[5250.95s -> 5251.75s]  Just do it again.
[5252.39s -> 5255.51s]  Three, two, one, action.
[5255.51s -> 5256.55s]  Follow the lead vehicle.
[5257.43s -> 5258.23s]  Scrape the vehicle.
[5282.23s -> 5283.35s]  I'll just add my own stunts.
[5285.11s -> 5299.43s]  Big drift.
[5301.88s -> 5302.76s]  I'm doing my own stunts.
[5303.56s -> 5318.23s]  No, the tree just ruined everything.
[5318.95s -> 5319.91s]  Why did you do that?
[5320.55s -> 5322.47s]  I had like a four or five star going too.
[5322.47s -> 5323.91s]  Jump the logs.
[5323.91s -> 5343.38s]  There he is, I'm fine.
[5344.10s -> 5347.10s]  Oh shit, I got it.
[5348.22s -> 5351.37s]  Oh my god, how was I supposed to know?
[5352.33s -> 5362.82s]  Oh no.
[5370.98s -> 5371.62s]  It's fine.
[5396.30s -> 5397.82s]  He's totally going to work.
[5399.40s -> 5403.03s]  I can't even watch the game replay.
[5403.03s -> 5403.75s]  It doesn't even matter.
[5403.75s -> 5404.79s]  Whatever.
[5404.79s -> 5416.95s]  I'm Jack Lee, General Steward.
[5417.91s -> 5420.12s]  You are average.
[5421.00s -> 5423.32s]  Well, two and a half would be average.
[5424.04s -> 5425.85s]  A little bit above average.
[5427.29s -> 5429.37s]  Let's see if we, in full motion video.
[5430.41s -> 5445.32s]  Added my own stunt here.
[5446.28s -> 5448.86s]  I jumped this entire semi.
[5451.10s -> 5453.38s]  That's some people doing their shit right there.
[5454.50s -> 5487.77s]  The chicken sound was perfect.
[5489.05s -> 5493.61s]  Here we go.
[5494.41s -> 5496.14s]  Leads a good view.
[5497.10s -> 5505.56s]  See the temptation there to just run that guy over.
[5506.44s -> 5507.67s]  I didn't do it though.
[5507.67s -> 5509.11s]  I wanted to finish this.
[5509.11s -> 5524.10s]  Here we go.
[5524.58s -> 5536.78s]  That was actually way, way better.
[5541.14s -> 5543.22s]  The music stops and the music picks back up.
[5544.34s -> 5545.54s]  By design, as intended.
[5546.10s -> 5567.22s]  This will be a bad action, but we'll do a good comedy.
[5575.74s -> 5576.30s]  All right.
[5576.30s -> 5577.82s]  Stunt City Team Unlocked.
[5577.82s -> 5578.38s]  Here we go.
[5580.06s -> 5584.14s]  We are at the final scene of movement and hollering.
[5587.02s -> 5590.70s]  This is the other side of the bank robber chase you shot in Grab and Go.
[5590.70s -> 5591.26s]  Not the side.
[5591.26s -> 5592.86s]  And the last scene for this movie.
[5592.86s -> 5594.54s]  This time you'll play the Creek Boys.
[5594.54s -> 5597.50s]  Trying to stop the hijacked armored vehicle to get some reward.
[5597.50s -> 5599.82s]  Do I get a Mario Kart ghost that is on the screen too?
[5599.82s -> 5600.62s]  Another chase scene.
[5600.62s -> 5603.50s]  So remember, don't fall too far behind the lead.
[5603.50s -> 5607.10s]  The key stunt is a jump onto the upper deck of a storefront.
[5607.10s -> 5609.34s]  Hit the jump and break through the balusters.
[5609.98s -> 5614.38s]  Once on top, keep that speed going to hit the jump and clear the semi.
[5614.38s -> 5614.94s]  All right.
[5614.94s -> 5616.54s]  Let's get out there and break some stuff.
[5616.54s -> 5618.62s]  That would be awesome if it actually is the other cars.
[5627.85s -> 5629.21s]  That was all over one radio.
[5630.17s -> 5631.13s]  They're all leaning in.
[5634.71s -> 5641.18s]  That's me, right?
[5642.33s -> 5642.97s]  That's other me.
[5649.43s -> 5651.75s]  It's definitely other me because it's dropping like a fucking idiot.
[5665.35s -> 5665.75s]  Scrape.
[5666.63s -> 5667.83s]  Oh, I just barely scraped.
[5670.44s -> 5670.84s]  Scrape.
[5672.07s -> 5672.39s]  Again.
[5672.39s -> 5672.87s]  Okay, good.
[5673.51s -> 5676.78s]  I am.
[5677.50s -> 5684.02s]  That was tricky, but I did it.
[5690.68s -> 5693.40s]  I think I just, I think I just accidentally killed that car.
[5702.14s -> 5704.94s]  Did I get it?
[5704.94s -> 5705.26s]  I got it.
[5705.26s -> 5716.92s]  Over the tanker.
[5716.92s -> 5723.38s]  Now what?
[5723.38s -> 5724.58s]  That's a real hard left.
[5738.97s -> 5739.61s]  Damn it.
[5739.61s -> 5740.73s]  That's not, that's going to be the end.
[5741.69s -> 5742.49s]  That's going to be the end of me.
[5743.45s -> 5749.88s]  No, got into the tires.
[5750.84s -> 5753.59s]  Um, do I have to keep going?
[5754.23s -> 5763.14s]  Apparently not.
[5764.02s -> 5774.65s]  We're in a one-star ranking for all seasons in an all-around guy.
[5776.01s -> 5778.15s]  Taurus World Stunt Ward.
[5779.43s -> 5782.01s]  More color customization.
[5788.01s -> 5788.81s]  Don't skip.
[5788.81s -> 5789.69s]  You don't skip it.
[5790.41s -> 5811.67s]  Why is it stuck there?
[5816.95s -> 5818.47s]  That was pretty tight.
[5820.92s -> 5823.32s]  I do something up here that I'm really proud of, actually.
[5823.32s -> 5825.72s]  I weave in and out of like four or five trees, like right here.
[5825.72s -> 5826.36s]  Ready?
[5826.36s -> 5828.36s]  One, two, three trees, four trees, five trees.
[5829.08s -> 5831.56s]  Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen trees.
[5832.20s -> 5832.68s]  You see that?
[5845.54s -> 5848.98s]  Fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty, twenty, twenty-two, twenty-three.
[5860.70s -> 5861.90s]  Most of those were lamps.
[5876.22s -> 5877.34s]  I'm excited for the trailer.
[5877.34s -> 5878.22s]  I'm going to do the commercial.
[5894.52s -> 5894.84s]  Nice.
[5896.95s -> 5897.67s]  Three stars.
[5902.30s -> 5908.55s]  All right, time to be quiet and watch the trailer.
[5909.11s -> 5916.60s]  You look mean, Sheriff.
[5916.60s -> 5917.64s]  You look mean.
[5917.64s -> 5922.44s]  Well, maybe this will be enough to remind them boys whose town it is.
[5923.80s -> 5953.30s]  Definitely.
[5981.03s -> 5997.35s]  There we go.
[5998.39s -> 6001.74s]  Uh, it was whooping in a hall room, too.
[6004.30s -> 6010.49s]  Where's the commercial?
[6011.93s -> 6012.81s]  Oddjobs.
[6012.81s -> 6013.31s]  Ooh.
[6014.09s -> 6015.13s]  Stunt City Club.
[6015.13s -> 6015.63s]  Hold on.
[6016.49s -> 6017.13s]  Rehearsals.
[6018.17s -> 6018.81s]  Hold on.
[6018.81s -> 6019.21s]  Here we go.
[6019.77s -> 6020.81s]  Stunt City Fire.
[6020.81s -> 6021.37s]  Car commercial.
[6022.01s -> 6022.97s]  I'm doing a car commercial.
[6027.51s -> 6032.39s]  In this commercial, you'll play a citizen of darkdom driving the new Venus Vexation
[6032.39s -> 6033.51s]  sports car.
[6033.51s -> 6037.59s]  The gags that you out-drive Night Avenger because your car is so fast.
[6038.23s -> 6042.07s]  You'll be using Nitro and the key run happens during your second boost.
[6042.63s -> 6045.83s]  Speed past the exploding cars and under the torch semi.
[6047.35s -> 6051.59s]  Then overtake Night Avenger on the left and end with a huge drift right.
[6051.59s -> 6053.35s]  Turning will be hard at high speed.
[6053.35s -> 6055.51s]  So you'll have to anticipate the stunts early.
[6058.23s -> 6063.18s]  You're faster than Batman in product placement.
[6063.18s -> 6063.68s]  Okay.
[6064.46s -> 6064.96s]  I'm ready.
[6071.99s -> 6075.14s]  There's Batman.
[6085.16s -> 6088.02s]  All right, I gotta be cleaner than that.
[6093.70s -> 6094.90s]  No failures are allowed.
[6113.34s -> 6113.84s]  What?
[6113.84s -> 6115.28s]  Oh, I didn't even know it was over there.
[6142.11s -> 6144.91s]  Shit, this is one of those addicting goddamn games where it's going to make me just sit
[6144.91s -> 6145.95s]  here for like an hour, isn't it?
[6152.03s -> 6155.61s]  I tried to pass close, but he flew backward.
[6158.97s -> 6170.54s]  What's going on here?
[6170.54s -> 6173.02s]  Three, two, one, action.
[6183.10s -> 6184.46s]  This car is too fast.
[6192.25s -> 6192.89s]  Show them this.
[6210.14s -> 6210.64s]  What?
[6218.17s -> 6219.85s]  I couldn't get what the fuck are you talking about?
[6222.56s -> 6223.76s]  Get close to the explosion.
[6223.76s -> 6225.20s]  You blew it up on top of me.
[6225.84s -> 6243.48s]  I'm faster than Batman already.
[6243.48s -> 6244.68s]  I'm faster than Batman.
[6245.48s -> 6247.45s]  Tell him to speed up.
[6248.17s -> 6249.13s]  Can we switch cars?
[6249.13s -> 6250.41s]  Just paint this one black.
[6255.05s -> 6259.56s]  Just give him this one.
[6260.44s -> 6276.65s]  What happened?
[6277.69s -> 6281.45s]  What happened there?
[6281.45s -> 6281.77s]  What happened?
[6281.77s -> 6282.97s]  I didn't do anything.
[6284.25s -> 6284.97s]  I didn't do anything.
[6285.93s -> 6286.81s]  All right, I overtook him.
[6286.81s -> 6287.69s]  I drove in front of him.
[6289.53s -> 6292.17s]  How else do you overtake somebody besides like driving around?
[6314.84s -> 6323.88s]  Am I going too slow?
[6326.80s -> 6328.84s]  Two, one, action.
[6333.88s -> 6335.40s]  I did overtake this thing.
[6335.40s -> 6336.68s]  He didn't say overtake.
[6337.80s -> 6339.13s]  Watch, ready?
[6341.47s -> 6343.07s]  So I overtake this guy.
[6343.07s -> 6343.55s]  I did it.
[6357.31s -> 6360.91s]  I literally drive right next to the cop car and overtake him.
[6366.64s -> 6380.03s]  Ready?
[6380.03s -> 6383.80s]  Did that not count?
[6390.41s -> 6391.05s]  I don't understand.
[6392.94s -> 6394.78s]  Why did it take so long to fail again?
[6398.40s -> 6398.96s]  One.
[6398.96s -> 6405.00s]  Why is it waiting to the end of the level to fail it?
[6405.00s -> 6427.69s]  I got you.
[6435.16s -> 6444.33s]  I can get five on this one.
[6444.33s -> 6444.89s]  Let's do five.
[6457.93s -> 6459.16s]  One, action.
[6459.96s -> 6470.40s]  That was close.
[6470.40s -> 6471.77s]  That's all the shit.
[6474.04s -> 6476.51s]  I can do five on this one.
[6476.51s -> 6479.31s]  Three, two, one, action.
[6480.27s -> 6482.88s]  Drip left.
[6483.84s -> 6484.64s]  Last try, that's it.
[6500.97s -> 6503.05s]  Christ, I'm spamming triangle.
[6503.05s -> 6503.77s]  Why?
[6503.77s -> 6505.45s]  Oh, I'm so angry right now.
[6505.85s -> 6507.05s]  I'm fucking furious.
[6508.25s -> 6510.09s]  I'm literally sitting there hitting triangle.
[6510.09s -> 6511.71s]  Three, two, one, action.
[6511.71s -> 6514.38s]  That doesn't make any sense.
[6514.38s -> 6515.58s]  Drip left.
[6515.58s -> 6527.24s]  That is impossible that I didn't get that.
[6527.80s -> 6528.84s]  It's actually impossible.
[6531.15s -> 6532.43s]  One, action.
[6533.31s -> 6535.87s]  I'm gonna look at a chat, hold on.
[6535.87s -> 6537.47s]  Three, two, one, action.
[6537.47s -> 6537.95s]  This is it.
[6537.95s -> 6538.83s]  This is the last one I'm gonna do
[6538.83s -> 6540.11s]  and then I'm gonna fucking pee and come back.
[6540.91s -> 6712.51s]  Hey, let's go.
[6715.79s -> 6717.53s]  Five.
[6717.53s -> 6720.33s]  In this show, you'll drive a bike that's on fire,
[6720.33s -> 6723.29s]  causing explosions as you drive close to propane tanks
[6723.29s -> 6724.57s]  and other vehicles.
[6724.57s -> 6727.13s]  The big moment in the show starts with a slide
[6727.13s -> 6729.37s]  beneath this semi, igniting it.
[6729.37s -> 6732.17s]  Then throw a 180 between the propane tanks,
[6732.17s -> 6733.45s]  making them blow up too.
[6734.41s -> 6736.01s]  As soon as you've spun around,
[6736.01s -> 6738.49s]  line up for the big ramp and gun it hard.
[6738.49s -> 6742.09s]  He beat up his pillow into the bedroom,
[6742.09s -> 6742.49s]  just like.
[6746.33s -> 6747.21s]  Hey guys, I'm back.
[6748.73s -> 6750.30s]  What's going on?
[6750.30s -> 6751.26s]  Love mech this train.
[6752.22s -> 6761.92s]  Jesus, this looks damn good.
[6761.92s -> 6764.88s]  Three, two, one, action.
[6764.88s -> 6766.08s]  He starts off the jump.
[6766.08s -> 6781.74s]  Oh, I almost missed it.
[6787.92s -> 6790.00s]  Let's reset, try that again.
[6790.00s -> 6791.52s]  Look at how big that jump is over there.
[6793.60s -> 6795.87s]  There are traps everywhere for me.
[6795.87s -> 6796.67s]  That's not nice.
[6796.67s -> 6798.99s]  Two, one, action.
[6798.99s -> 6800.27s]  He starts off the jump.
[6800.99s -> 6815.28s]  180.
[6815.28s -> 6817.48s]  He starts off the jump.
[6817.48s -> 6819.24s]  Oh, you gotta start that way earlier
[6819.24s -> 6819.96s]  and go too fast.
[6825.92s -> 6827.60s]  Yeah, you're going way, way, way, way too fast.
[6828.08s -> 6832.97s]  Three, two, one, action.
[6832.97s -> 6833.77s]  He starts off.
[6833.77s -> 6854.52s]  I technically still did it, so it's okay.
[6862.89s -> 6870.36s]  Jesus, that was like going down a roller coaster.
[6882.94s -> 6883.98s]  Four, I'll take four.
[6884.70s -> 6894.51s]  Check it out.
[6908.08s -> 6926.60s]  I landed on the front tire and stuck it.
[6929.24s -> 6935.66s]  That was pretty insane.
[6936.46s -> 6941.21s]  There's one more here.
[6946.92s -> 6948.20s]  Stunt City team.
[6949.48s -> 6951.18s]  Might as well do them.
[6951.18s -> 6954.14s]  The emphasis of this show is team precision driving.
[6954.14s -> 6956.46s]  You'll be out there with a bunch of other stunt drivers
[6956.46s -> 6958.14s]  weaving back and forth between them
[6958.14s -> 6961.34s]  in a tightly choreographed run with lots of overtakes.
[6961.34s -> 6961.82s]  180.
[6961.82s -> 6962.54s]  Back to Batman.
[6962.54s -> 6963.34s]  I'll show the Batman.
[6964.38s -> 6966.46s]  Make your maneuvers as quickly as you can
[6966.46s -> 6968.38s]  and be sure never to hit the other cars
[6968.38s -> 6969.82s]  or you'll knock them off their marks
[6969.82s -> 6972.38s]  and the whole show will turn into a collision derby.
[6972.38s -> 6974.46s]  Fun as that sounds, it's not the goal.
[6974.46s -> 6975.34s]  So behave yourself.
[6976.22s -> 6977.10s]  This one sucks.
[6977.10s -> 6977.98s]  This one's horrible.
[6977.98s -> 6979.10s]  You've seen them on TV.
[6979.10s -> 6979.50s]  It's okay.
[6979.50s -> 6982.24s]  Now see the rip roaring.
[6982.24s -> 6982.80s]  I got this.
[6991.15s -> 6992.35s]  Only 60,000 points.
[6995.39s -> 6996.51s]  Close to the first car.
[7010.65s -> 7012.01s]  You got to be perfect there.
[7017.28s -> 7035.93s]  All right.
[7035.93s -> 7036.73s]  What?
[7036.73s -> 7039.93s]  I have to keep going all the way back?
[7040.81s -> 7043.42s]  I got to go start the turn in the box.
[7043.42s -> 7043.66s]  Okay.
[7044.70s -> 7046.51s]  I figured I could just go through the box.
[7050.86s -> 7062.51s]  You're going to restart because somebody else crashed.
[7063.55s -> 7068.19s]  That's not me.
[7068.51s -> 7069.79s]  The camera's not even on them.
[7069.79s -> 7070.51s]  The camera's on me.
[7088.27s -> 7088.75s]  Damn it.
[7110.27s -> 7110.51s]  Shit.
[7112.51s -> 7123.29s]  Come on.
[7124.01s -> 7124.81s]  What the hell?
[7125.85s -> 7146.83s]  What's happening?
[7149.58s -> 7151.02s]  What the fuck is happening?
[7151.74s -> 7154.24s]  What the hell do you want me to do after that?
[7154.24s -> 7155.84s]  It didn't say anything.
[7155.84s -> 7156.08s]  What?
[7157.04s -> 7165.44s]  What happens after the reverse 180?
[7165.44s -> 7168.16s]  Do I have to drive by the drivers again?
[7183.04s -> 7183.36s]  Okay.
[7184.24s -> 7184.72s]  I get it.
[7187.32s -> 7189.16s]  So I have to drive near that guy.
[7207.02s -> 7208.06s]  Did I do it?
[7208.06s -> 7208.38s]  I did it.
[7224.20s -> 7225.32s]  Give me a break.
[7225.32s -> 7226.76s]  I was right there.
[7226.76s -> 7229.00s]  I caught running out of gas at the finish line.
[7229.96s -> 7232.43s]  I'll get it.
[7243.72s -> 7246.76s]  I'm holding right on the pad.
[7247.72s -> 7251.98s]  I was holding right that whole time.
[7251.98s -> 7252.94s]  Unbelievable.
[7252.94s -> 7255.18s]  I can't believe I didn't fucking stop with that.
[7255.18s -> 7256.14s]  Unbelievable.
[7259.04s -> 7259.92s]  Unbelievable.
[7261.21s -> 7262.09s]  I touched him.
[7262.09s -> 7262.65s]  Game over.
[7263.61s -> 7268.06s]  I was holding right trick.
[7268.06s -> 7268.46s]  I was.
[7272.44s -> 7278.92s]  Dude, I could see like a 17, 18-year-old losing his fucking mind.
[7279.56s -> 7281.40s]  I'm 34 losing my mind too.
[7282.04s -> 7282.60s]  It doesn't matter.
[7288.76s -> 7289.64s]  That age doesn't matter.
[7308.03s -> 7310.75s]  When I hovered over this, somebody in all caps wrote,
[7310.75s -> 7312.03s]  this one is horrible.
[7313.71s -> 7314.99s]  And I was like, what are you talking about?
[7333.04s -> 7333.76s]  Get in there.
[7333.76s -> 7334.24s]  I did it.
[7334.24s -> 7334.96s]  Everything's fine.
[7334.96s -> 7335.60s]  Don't worry about it.
[7335.60s -> 7336.16s]  It's good.
[7336.16s -> 7336.72s]  I'm good to go.
[7336.72s -> 7337.44s]  Everything's perfect.
[7338.64s -> 7356.56s]  I'll take four.
[7356.56s -> 7358.16s]  I don't want to see the replay in this one.
[7358.64s -> 7359.28s]  I don't want to see it.
[7360.32s -> 7364.14s]  It's angering me even just like smelling this in my vicinity.
[7365.74s -> 7387.95s]  It actually gave me the boost I needed.
[7399.23s -> 7399.71s]  There you go.
[7400.91s -> 7401.63s]  All right.
[7401.63s -> 7402.75s]  Back to the career menu.
[7404.08s -> 7404.96s]  Where's the Batman at?
[7408.09s -> 7409.21s]  Overdrive unlocked.
[7412.35s -> 7414.03s]  I can't show you the replay of the Batman.
[7414.03s -> 7414.83s]  I have to...
[7414.83s -> 7417.47s]  In this commercial, you'll play a citizen of darkdom
[7417.47s -> 7420.83s]  driving the new Venus vexation sports car.
[7420.83s -> 7423.31s]  The gags that you out-drive Night Avenger
[7423.31s -> 7424.91s]  because your car is so fast.
[7425.55s -> 7426.91s]  You'll be using nature
[7426.91s -> 7429.39s]  and the key run happens during your second boost.
[7429.95s -> 7433.23s]  Speed past the exploding cars and under the torch semi.
[7434.51s -> 7436.59s]  Then overtake Night Avenger on the left
[7436.59s -> 7438.27s]  and end with a huge drift right.
[7438.83s -> 7440.51s]  Turning will be hard at high speed
[7440.51s -> 7442.27s]  so you'll have to anticipate the stunts.
[7442.27s -> 7443.07s]  Take on...
[7443.07s -> 7443.87s]  Nice gag.
[7443.87s -> 7444.59s]  What gag?
[7444.59s -> 7446.75s]  Everyone was saying show the replay
[7446.75s -> 7448.43s]  because I skipped it because I freaked out.
[7451.58s -> 7451.90s]  Load.
[7451.90s -> 7453.18s]  I didn't save a replay.
[7453.18s -> 7453.50s]  All right.
[7453.50s -> 7453.90s]  Here we go.
[7455.98s -> 7478.46s]  I swear to God.
[7478.46s -> 7479.10s]  I swear to God.
[7481.10s -> 7482.22s]  You have to understand something.
[7482.22s -> 7484.06s]  There's no way I fucked that up.
[7484.06s -> 7485.02s]  I'm hitting triangle.
[7485.82s -> 7486.38s]  Like this.
[7486.38s -> 7486.94s]  Do you understand?
[7487.58s -> 7488.86s]  Like that happened twice now.
[7488.86s -> 7490.14s]  Like in the same spot.
[7490.14s -> 7491.02s]  In the same spot.
[7491.02s -> 7491.90s]  I'm hitting triangle.
[7491.90s -> 7492.38s]  Like what?
[7492.38s -> 7493.02s]  I've never...
[7493.02s -> 7493.52s]  What?
[7495.68s -> 7496.72s]  That doesn't make any sense.
[7499.23s -> 7500.27s]  Triangle is the button.
[7500.27s -> 7501.15s]  I swear to God.
[7501.15s -> 7501.71s]  That happened.
[7501.71s -> 7504.35s]  Like clip this and clip one to the floor.
[7504.35s -> 7505.39s]  That happened in the same spot.
[7507.12s -> 7507.84s]  I swear.
[7507.84s -> 7508.48s]  I promise.
[7509.44s -> 7510.32s]  Why would I not look?
[7510.32s -> 7511.12s]  Oh, it's triangle.
[7511.12s -> 7511.62s]  Okay.
[7512.96s -> 7514.32s]  I just forget how to play the game.
[7515.36s -> 7517.89s]  Ready?
[7518.99s -> 7526.19s]  All right.
[7527.36s -> 7528.08s]  It's over.
[7528.08s -> 7528.56s]  I did it.
[7529.12s -> 7542.17s]  That's not five stars.
[7542.97s -> 7543.52s]  All right.
[7543.52s -> 7544.24s]  I'm going to skip this.
[7544.88s -> 7546.56s]  I got the five star replay.
[7547.52s -> 7550.65s]  Here.
[7550.65s -> 7552.17s]  Just pretend this is like 25.
[7566.27s -> 7596.38s]  That was really, really bad at rehearsals.
[7596.38s -> 7596.62s]  All right.
[7596.62s -> 7597.18s]  Aftershock.
[7597.18s -> 7597.82s]  Here we go.
[7597.82s -> 7599.18s]  Strike Force Omega.
[7612.84s -> 7639.45s]  Is that a thistle on the truck?
[7643.61s -> 7646.49s]  Army style truck with 50 caliber auto turret.
[7646.49s -> 7648.25s]  It's a badass with a capital B.
[7649.47s -> 7652.03s]  Anyway, lots of my fans still think I do my own stunts.
[7652.03s -> 7653.31s]  So you better be good.
[7653.31s -> 7654.91s]  I got a reputation to protect.
[7655.63s -> 7657.63s]  Now I need to go bulk up for my next fight scene.
[7657.63s -> 7659.23s]  I'll see you on the set.
[7659.23s -> 7659.73s]  What?
[7660.19s -> 7661.31s]  You looking for an autograph?
[7662.03s -> 7665.07s]  Hey Marcus, get him one of those commemorative iPads.
[7668.17s -> 7670.41s]  I'll tell you, nothing beats working with a director
[7670.41s -> 7672.81s]  who thinks he should be driving for you.
[7672.81s -> 7675.05s]  I've worked with Steel before and trust me,
[7675.05s -> 7676.81s]  he's not easy to please.
[7676.81s -> 7680.01s]  But the good news is the man knows how to make an exciting action film.
[7680.01s -> 7682.01s]  So we've got some killer stunts lined up.
[7682.01s -> 7682.17s]  All right.
[7682.17s -> 7684.33s]  Some of the vehicles in this movie are heavily armed
[7684.33s -> 7687.21s]  and include a modified dune buggy, a motorcycle,
[7687.21s -> 7690.41s]  an unwieldy semi towing a giant Scud missile
[7690.41s -> 7693.69s]  and Commander Black's heavily armed assault vehicle, the Scorpion.
[7693.69s -> 7696.65s]  The missile is mostly open desert terrain
[7696.65s -> 7699.21s]  where you'll be driving on loosely packed dirt,
[7699.21s -> 7701.93s]  but you'll also need to weave your way through the strike force base
[7701.93s -> 7703.77s]  where there isn't much room to maneuver.
[7703.93s -> 7706.17s]  You'll also have your first chance to use nitrous,
[7706.17s -> 7709.37s]  giving you an extra punch of speed to make that fast escape.
[7709.93s -> 7712.25s]  Listen to me and hit your marks and you should walk away
[7712.25s -> 7713.37s]  with some impressive addition.
[7714.49s -> 7716.89s]  You'll start as a strike force Omega operative
[7716.89s -> 7720.17s]  trying to get a stolen Scud missile back to base.
[7720.17s -> 7723.29s]  The focus stunt is a side swipe of a combat bus.
[7723.85s -> 7726.97s]  Don't aim straight for the bus or you'll get drawn out too far.
[7727.77s -> 7730.01s]  Instead, aim for the gap in the bridge ahead.
[7730.01s -> 7731.13s]  And the gap in the bridge.
[7731.37s -> 7735.13s]  So you can veer slightly to side swipe the bus before taking the gap.
[7743.04s -> 7745.12s]  This is not like an active missile, right?
[7759.69s -> 7762.01s]  That moves with it.
[7762.97s -> 7766.17s]  Okay, that's a tricky turn with this thing.
[7767.29s -> 7787.80s]  Oh, just start over.
[7788.76s -> 7789.84s]  Just start over.
[7792.00s -> 7793.60s]  I was trying to swipe him with the tail.
[7806.38s -> 7811.07s]  Around we go.
[7812.51s -> 7815.55s]  Scrape, scrape, get up.
[7819.28s -> 7820.48s]  Come on, get the other one.
[7821.36s -> 7822.24s]  Nope, didn't get it.
[7836.59s -> 7843.39s]  Is this thing gonna blow?
[7843.95s -> 7848.51s]  Oh, I just rolled across the bridge.
[7852.91s -> 7855.63s]  They blew the bridge that I was crossing.
[7862.92s -> 7867.42s]  Once it became clear that I wasn't gonna go over the jump,
[7867.42s -> 7869.18s]  I would just still blow the bridge.
[7873.02s -> 7874.54s]  That seems like a bad idea.
[7885.24s -> 7885.96s]  Double, nice.
[7887.48s -> 7890.03s]  Okay, I gotta go over the jump here.
[7918.78s -> 7920.86s]  Left, right, left, right.
[7921.74s -> 7923.02s]  That was panic turning.
[7923.82s -> 7925.02s]  Sorry, three stars, I'll take it.
[7925.98s -> 7934.25s]  Nomination.
[7934.81s -> 7940.17s]  Let's take a look.
[7951.44s -> 7953.36s]  So what, I got caught on something over here.
[7954.08s -> 7966.08s]  I didn't kill the other, I didn't hit the other guy.
[7966.96s -> 7970.57s]  I just scraped his friend.
[7978.38s -> 7979.18s]  That was it right there.
[7979.18s -> 7979.90s]  That was the issue.
[7988.49s -> 7989.93s]  Actually, it was not even that bad.
[7990.49s -> 7992.17s]  It was pretty good, actually.
[7994.75s -> 7995.31s]  That was fine.
[7996.19s -> 7999.80s]  There's the gap, though.
[8004.09s -> 8005.93s]  Motorcycle mission, let's go.
[8005.93s -> 8010.89s]  Now, you'll double for a strike force scout returning to base with vital intelligence.
[8010.89s -> 8016.17s]  A challenging stunt is an aerial gap through a passing semi and into its trailer.
[8016.17s -> 8019.85s]  Come over a hill, then straighten up fast so you can aim for the jump.
[8020.41s -> 8022.97s]  Don't make last second adjustments once you're on the ramp.
[8022.97s -> 8023.85s]  That'll mess you up.
[8023.85s -> 8025.77s]  I have to go through a gap.
[8025.77s -> 8028.33s]  You'll need to slide beneath a second trailer, so be ready.
[8028.33s -> 8028.97s]  Oh, God.
[8028.97s -> 8032.36s]  If you're any good on a bike.
[8032.36s -> 8038.04s]  Okay, I guess we're gonna go, I'm just gonna go for it.
[8038.04s -> 8038.36s]  Action.
[8039.24s -> 8040.04s]  Overtake left.
[8050.92s -> 8052.41s]  What a movie scene.
[8053.60s -> 8055.76s]  Our hero overtakes the criminal on the...
[8056.88s -> 8057.20s]  Bye.
[8060.33s -> 8061.69s]  Not even wearing a fucking helmet.
[8061.69s -> 8062.33s]  No, I know.
[8063.53s -> 8070.44s]  This guy seriously get...
[8071.16s -> 8088.32s]  Now what?
[8090.32s -> 8094.03s]  What?
[8094.03s -> 8094.59s]  I just...
[8094.59s -> 8095.39s]  Did I do that?
[8095.39s -> 8096.27s]  Did I really do that?
[8115.18s -> 8117.26s]  There's no way I was gonna do that.
[8118.06s -> 8119.10s]  Not a chance in hell.
[8120.84s -> 8122.12s]  Absolute zero chance.
[8122.92s -> 8135.76s]  Ah!
[8142.51s -> 8143.01s]  Gap!
[8149.37s -> 8150.33s]  I can't believe I just made it.
[8152.19s -> 8153.71s]  I can do that one better.
[8153.71s -> 8154.59s]  That's three, it's fine.
[8155.39s -> 8168.08s]  The majority of the stream has been him saying a thing that I'm not ready for
[8168.08s -> 8172.00s]  and then me shockingly yelling the word he just said out loud.
[8172.64s -> 8174.08s]  This is one of those comedy movies.
[8174.80s -> 8177.28s]  And by the way, you gotta be careful for that gap.
[8177.28s -> 8177.78s]  What gap?
[8178.80s -> 8179.30s]  Gap?
[8181.21s -> 8181.71s]  There it is.
[8182.33s -> 8206.06s]  That was a pretty cool first person cam.
[8206.94s -> 8208.51s]  What?
[8211.18s -> 8213.44s]  That was a little messed up, but it's okay.
[8213.44s -> 8215.04s]  That first person cam doesn't work there.
[8215.92s -> 8218.17s]  It sounds like I hit something else too.
[8242.24s -> 8242.74s]  Pretty good.
[8243.28s -> 8244.48s]  It's all right, I'll take three.
[8250.60s -> 8252.84s]  Armor all, commercial unlocked.
[8252.84s -> 8253.34s]  Nice.
[8255.20s -> 8256.16s]  Dogs of war.
[8257.68s -> 8262.48s]  In this scene you'll double for an enemy merc rampaging through the SFO base.
[8262.48s -> 8264.08s]  The key stunt is a weaving...
[8264.08s -> 8265.12s]  It's a real brain, yeah.
[8265.76s -> 8266.88s]  Once you're in the base,
[8266.88s -> 8270.56s]  drift left as quickly and sharply as possible so you can set up your line.
[8271.12s -> 8275.04s]  Then thread between the three semis as they come straight at you.
[8275.04s -> 8277.60s]  You'll pass right, then left, then right.
[8277.60s -> 8280.40s]  This is another high-risk stunt, so keep it safe.
[8281.44s -> 8283.60s]  You're playing an enemy merc in this scene.
[8283.60s -> 8285.84s]  I want him driving wild and crazy.
[8285.84s -> 8286.72s]  Don't let me down.
[8290.03s -> 8292.11s]  270,000 points, that's a lot.
[8292.11s -> 8294.43s]  Three, two, one, action.
[8294.43s -> 8315.79s]  Oh my god, I'm not gonna do that.
[8326.62s -> 8327.58s]  The thing exploded.
[8328.86s -> 8330.94s]  I can't pass it when it's gone.
[8344.06s -> 8345.18s]  What an explosion.
[8345.82s -> 8346.32s]  This one.
[8356.03s -> 8356.91s]  I love this game.
[8356.91s -> 8358.27s]  This game is so bonkers.
[8358.27s -> 8360.35s]  Three, two, one, action.
[8360.35s -> 8361.96s]  To the explosion.
[8361.96s -> 8370.96s]  This pole.
[8371.74s -> 8372.38s]  Fuck this pole.
[8373.18s -> 8374.25s]  You know what I mean?
[8374.25s -> 8375.05s]  No, fuck that pole.
[8375.05s -> 8375.77s]  I'm not gonna let that win.
[8375.77s -> 8378.49s]  Three, two, one, action.
[8379.37s -> 8390.49s]  Too much drifting.
[8390.49s -> 8391.29s]  Too much drifting.
[8392.17s -> 8393.21s]  Too much drifting.
[8393.21s -> 8394.41s]  Drifting all over the place.
[8394.41s -> 8395.13s]  Way too much of it.
[8396.01s -> 8399.05s]  Pass this guy.
[8400.01s -> 8402.42s]  Got it.
[8410.84s -> 8413.87s]  Got it.
[8413.87s -> 8422.99s]  Oh shit.
[8424.01s -> 8428.72s]  Which one?
[8438.83s -> 8439.47s]  Sloppy.
[8439.47s -> 8440.27s]  Very sloppy.
[8440.99s -> 8442.19s]  Too sloppy.
[8442.19s -> 8442.99s]  But it's alright.
[8446.89s -> 8449.37s]  This is really bad.
[8449.37s -> 8451.29s]  This is really, really bad.
[8451.29s -> 8452.49s]  This is really bad.
[8457.29s -> 8457.79s]  Man.
[8463.56s -> 8465.80s]  There was a live animal in that car with me.
[8466.36s -> 8468.04s]  That's the only way that I can describe
[8468.20s -> 8469.24s]  the way I was moving around.
[8474.65s -> 8477.21s]  There was a fucking bear in that car.
[8477.21s -> 8493.98s]  This guy right here.
[8493.98s -> 8495.18s]  That guy fucks it up every time.
[8496.06s -> 8496.54s]  No.
[8496.54s -> 8497.50s]  I gotta get around that.
[8497.50s -> 8499.82s]  It's just, that pole sucks.
[8500.62s -> 8505.50s]  The pole and there's an exploded car.
[8506.38s -> 8510.60s]  Right there.
[8510.60s -> 8511.72s]  You gotta go around it.
[8511.72s -> 8518.78s]  Here it is.
[8518.78s -> 8519.90s]  No, pass around here.
[8521.18s -> 8522.06s]  He just turned into me.
[8522.70s -> 8526.14s]  You're too close.
[8535.34s -> 8557.29s]  Fuck you.
[8557.29s -> 8557.79s]  No.
[8558.65s -> 8561.04s]  That's such a small area to do that in.
[8571.68s -> 8572.18s]  Oh.
[8583.18s -> 8583.68s]  Damn it.
[8599.12s -> 8599.68s]  Too early.
[8599.68s -> 8600.40s]  It's okay.
[8600.40s -> 8600.90s]  No.
[8601.36s -> 8601.86s]  That's gonna.
[8603.76s -> 8605.39s]  No, no.
[8605.85s -> 8606.25s]  I got it.
[8606.25s -> 8606.75s]  No, I didn't.
[8614.09s -> 8614.89s]  Oh, come on.
[8615.77s -> 8618.06s]  Trying to line it up.
[8618.62s -> 8623.34s]  That's not a direct thing left.
[8628.64s -> 8629.14s]  Great.
[8629.84s -> 8631.20s]  There's too many things going on.
[8634.89s -> 8637.53s]  No, I gotta be in the fucking circle to do it.
[8637.53s -> 8638.41s]  Oh, yay, yay.
[8638.41s -> 8641.87s]  Too many instructions.
[8642.67s -> 8643.71s]  Yeah, it really is.
[8644.51s -> 8646.97s]  I'll get it.
[8646.97s -> 8659.61s]  I'm gonna get an X here.
[8660.73s -> 8662.75s]  No, I got it.
[8663.47s -> 8663.95s]  All right.
[8663.95s -> 8664.43s]  Smooth it out.
[8664.43s -> 8664.91s]  Smooth it out.
[8664.91s -> 8665.47s]  Smooth it out.
[8665.47s -> 8665.97s]  I got it.
[8680.12s -> 8680.62s]  Got it.
[8681.16s -> 8681.66s]  Come on.
[8702.51s -> 8703.58s]  Okay, I'm fine.
[8704.30s -> 8714.51s]  Shit.
[8739.60s -> 8742.08s]  That's the whole reason for the stunt to be here in the first place.
[8742.08s -> 8748.46s]  Dude, I went too fast.
[8749.18s -> 8770.96s]  Slow down.
[8770.96s -> 8774.88s]  I can't believe it.
[8774.88s -> 8788.48s]  I'll get it.
[8788.94s -> 8797.68s]  Come here.
[8797.68s -> 8803.34s]  Please.
[8804.04s -> 8805.12s]  Okay, here we go.
[8817.21s -> 8818.81s]  Close to the explosion.
[8818.81s -> 8820.01s]  I thought I was going too fast.
[8820.01s -> 8821.53s]  Close to the explosion.
[8821.53s -> 8822.11s]  It's all right.
[8822.11s -> 8823.15s]  I can do it between now.
[8837.48s -> 8838.44s]  Every now and then, I went too fast.
[8838.44s -> 8839.48s]  I fucking hate that part.
[8861.68s -> 8863.28s]  Oh, damn it.
[8864.56s -> 8865.06s]  I gotta...
[8865.68s -> 8869.88s]  I'm playing Simon Says with cars.
[8870.68s -> 8883.82s]  Come on.
[8884.46s -> 8885.66s]  I can't touch it.
[8885.66s -> 8887.02s]  I can't touch the fucking thing.
[8887.02s -> 8911.61s]  Even touch the tire.
[8911.61s -> 8912.11s]  I...
[8912.57s -> 8913.07s]  That's dumb.
[8914.09s -> 8915.29s]  I'm being so careful.
[8915.45s -> 8916.25s]  Trying to get it right.
[8934.60s -> 8936.36s]  I just want to hit the helicopter.
[8936.36s -> 8938.20s]  I don't care about anything else.
[8938.20s -> 8939.40s]  Just let me hit the helicopter.
[8939.40s -> 8939.96s]  I don't care.
[8950.67s -> 8951.47s]  Hit the helicopter.
[8954.38s -> 8954.88s]  Get it.
[8956.54s -> 8957.04s]  No.
[8957.66s -> 8966.78s]  I'm all right.
[8967.32s -> 8998.46s]  No.
[8998.46s -> 8999.32s]  No, you motherfucker.
[8999.32s -> 9007.98s]  Don't come here.
[9007.98s -> 9008.48s]  No.
[9008.86s -> 9012.11s]  I just want to hit the fucking helicopter.
[9012.11s -> 9012.59s]  I don't care.
[9012.59s -> 9013.63s]  Just give me the fucking helicopter.
[9027.12s -> 9027.84s]  Thank God.
[9027.84s -> 9028.56s]  I'm finally out.
[9029.12s -> 9038.70s]  It's worse than before.
[9038.70s -> 9044.24s]  It's fine.
[9044.94s -> 9047.66s]  I'll be...
[9048.20s -> 9049.40s]  I don't want to see the...
[9049.64s -> 9050.84s]  Yes, I'll find it.
[9050.84s -> 9070.72s]  I think you get to play as Batman.
[9070.72s -> 9071.44s]  That's a good question.
[9072.32s -> 9074.99s]  Probably never.
[9075.63s -> 9090.09s]  But when it's cut up like that,
[9090.09s -> 9092.65s]  it looks way cooler than my panic screams.
[9093.61s -> 9112.81s]  What is this car made out of to be able to handle that?
[9114.01s -> 9124.20s]  This is going to be a fun one.
[9124.20s -> 9124.84s]  I can already tell.
[9124.84s -> 9126.84s]  Now you'll double for Commander Black,
[9126.84s -> 9130.84s]  protecting a strike force convoy when they're ambushed by the mercs.
[9130.84s -> 9135.64s]  A challenging line starts with you hitting two motorcycles at the exact same time,
[9135.64s -> 9137.32s]  which will make them both explode.
[9138.28s -> 9140.20s]  Then immediately throw a 180,
[9140.20s -> 9144.44s]  and quickly line up so you can avoid the semi that's speeding straight for you.
[9144.44s -> 9146.04s]  Once you've passed the semi,
[9146.04s -> 9147.96s]  you're left to take out the next bike.
[9149.00s -> 9151.64s]  Okay, it's Commander Black time.
[9151.64s -> 9153.40s]  If you've been holding any mojo back,
[9153.40s -> 9154.60s]  you better show it now.
[9154.60s -> 9156.20s]  I'm going to get hit by the truck.
[9157.16s -> 9157.96s]  200,000.
[9157.96s -> 9158.60s]  Let's see if I can get it.
[9158.60s -> 9160.52s]  Three, two, one, action.
[9161.32s -> 9167.98s]  Take out the motorcycle.
[9167.98s -> 9170.27s]  I missed one.
[9170.99s -> 9174.12s]  I was so focused on...
[9174.12s -> 9175.40s]  Take out the motorcycle.
[9175.40s -> 9182.97s]  Get it together.
[9182.97s -> 9184.24s]  One, action.
[9190.28s -> 9190.92s]  Right straight ahead.
[9190.92s -> 9200.65s]  Take out the motorcycle.
[9200.65s -> 9201.13s]  Damn it!
[9201.77s -> 9204.92s]  Can I still get him?
[9204.92s -> 9205.64s]  Take out the vehicle.
[9205.64s -> 9212.00s]  Pass under it.
[9228.92s -> 9229.42s]  What?
[9230.12s -> 9231.88s]  What do you want me to do?
[9231.88s -> 9233.16s]  What do you want me to do here?
[9234.36s -> 9247.90s]  Redo, redo, redo it.
[9247.90s -> 9249.74s]  Restart, restart, restart, restart, restart.
[9249.74s -> 9250.46s]  I thought that was the end.
[9250.46s -> 9259.13s]  Three, two, one.
[9259.13s -> 9271.16s]  Take out the motorcycle.
[9271.16s -> 9271.66s]  Perfect.
[9272.12s -> 9273.32s]  All right, let's make it happen.
[9273.32s -> 9274.60s]  Take out the vehicle.
[9274.60s -> 9282.64s]  Pretty good.
[9283.10s -> 9299.64s]  Take out the motorcycle.
[9299.64s -> 9300.14s]  Come here.
[9300.60s -> 9304.10s]  No!
[9309.37s -> 9310.01s]  Fuck!
[9310.01s -> 9311.33s]  I got it!
[9312.62s -> 9313.12s]  I got it!
[9326.27s -> 9328.35s]  That was times 42.
[9328.35s -> 9329.55s]  Unfortunately, that sucks.
[9330.75s -> 9339.63s]  It's all right.
[9339.63s -> 9340.19s]  I'll take it.
[9340.99s -> 9346.40s]  Scorpion and watch.
[9346.40s -> 9347.96s]  And a five-star replay.
[9348.60s -> 9350.27s]  Let's check it out.
[9350.91s -> 9360.25s]  That's so bad.
[9361.50s -> 9362.62s]  That's not even a stunt.
[9362.62s -> 9365.26s]  I'm just actually fucking murdering those guys.
[9379.18s -> 9381.82s]  This is so lukewarm at the end here, though, really.
[9382.78s -> 9395.52s]  I don't...
[9395.52s -> 9397.20s]  You can't edit this to make this look any better.
[9411.84s -> 9413.28s]  They kept that wide shot.
[9413.28s -> 9414.00s]  That's like...
[9414.00s -> 9415.76s]  That's the awkward shot.
[9416.56s -> 9417.92s]  It's on there for a little too long.
[9418.88s -> 9420.67s]  That's funny.
[9420.67s -> 9431.48s]  A couple more scenes.
[9431.48s -> 9432.44s]  Behind enemy lines.
[9433.48s -> 9437.16s]  In this scene, you'll play as Commander Black, escaping another ambush.
[9437.16s -> 9440.12s]  The highlight is the use of nitrous to aid your getaway.
[9440.12s -> 9443.16s]  There's a tricky line after your second burst of speed.
[9443.16s -> 9446.60s]  You'll smash into the back of a merc buggy, knocking it into the air.
[9447.24s -> 9450.52s]  Then pass beneath the collapsing silo before it falls
[9450.52s -> 9454.44s]  and immediately let off the gas so you can drift hard left and stay on the road.
[9455.48s -> 9462.81s]  All right, let's go.
[9464.51s -> 9465.31s]  240,000.
[9465.31s -> 9465.95s]  Three...
[9465.95s -> 9466.75s]  Two...
[9466.75s -> 9466.99s]  One...
[9467.63s -> 9467.95s]  Action!
[9467.95s -> 9471.18s]  Action!
[9476.59s -> 9476.91s]  Good.
[9477.87s -> 9478.43s]  That was good.
[9478.43s -> 9484.67s]  Overtake the dune buggy.
[9484.67s -> 9485.31s]  I didn't...
[9486.11s -> 9486.59s]  What the hell?
[9486.59s -> 9496.83s]  Not fast enough.
[9497.79s -> 9504.68s]  It's a dune buggy.
[9504.68s -> 9505.08s]  I did it.
[9505.80s -> 9507.71s]  I technically still did it.
[9508.27s -> 9518.86s]  Through the siloooooooooooooo!
[9519.50s -> 9521.02s]  You gotta be quick on this one.
[9521.58s -> 9530.41s]  Am I fast enough?
[9530.89s -> 9574.30s]  I gotta go all the way to the left, all the way to the left. Explosion. Good. Gate. Got him. Kill. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Too fast. Too fast. Too fast. Too fast. In between dune buggies.
[9574.30s -> 9591.89s]  Ah, didn't count. Didn't count. That was pretty good so far. That was pretty good.
[9597.80s -> 9650.60s]  Okay. Explosion. Hurry. Ooh. Tight. Scrape. I'm gonna miss it. No! Not again! I don't know where to press the button.
[9651.60s -> 9695.16s]  Ah, shit. It's so easy just to get thrown off the rails in this game. I get that start pretty good. Oh fuck, I forgot!
[9695.16s -> 9716.64s]  Alright, scrape. Why is that stupid thing there? The bus is just in the fucking way. Why is the bus there? What the hell do they have a bus there for? It's just in the way.
[9719.92s -> 9737.33s]  I think it's not good enough. No. No, no, no, no. No more twos. I'm not doing it. Not good enough. It's gotta be this thing.
[9746.12s -> 9776.88s]  Is that part of the bus? Do I have to go around the bus? Cause I can't go through it. Same deal. Go. Nitrous.
[9777.88s -> 9805.18s]  He's going just too damn fast. It's too fast. You go out of control. Use nitrous. Stop using nitrous. Oh, you're going 180? Ah, it's alright. You'll figure it out.
[9805.18s -> 9882.09s]  I'm so mad right now. That one guy on the bike. He goes so far to the left. Okay, let's go. Whatever.
[9897.86s -> 9922.68s]  Three! Yes, I'll take it. He killed him in the air. That was horrible. Let's see it. You go too fast, too slow, too fast, too slow. When you go too fast, something like that happens.
[9923.68s -> 9958.76s]  I missed this guy, I think. I don't think I hit him. No, yes I do. The motorcycle. Was the motorcycle on top of my car? Yeah, that's the guy I missed. I missed him twice.
[9971.27s -> 9981.92s]  I tried to swipe him, tried to swipe him, and then I just took it all out on his friend, apparently. Final scene. Here we go. Final conflict.
[9993.51s -> 9997.51s]  I'm going to flip four times.
[10024.51s -> 10058.17s]  I do this in parking lot all the time. No, I see what you guys are doing here. You just say that for every single stunt. Alright, so just do a roll. Sounds easy enough. Yeah, that's pretty self-explanatory. Yeah, I got it.
[10058.17s -> 10066.17s]  After you're airborne, you'll smash through a watchtower mid-spin. When you land, veer to the left and get back on the main road and continue the run.
[10067.17s -> 10097.16s]  That's it? That's all you have to explain? It's great that they do all this, but then there's 20 or 30 other stunts in the middle of this whole thing that he doesn't even talk about. It's a secret.
[10097.16s -> 10148.87s]  325,000. That's a pretty big score. It'll never get old. It really won't, really. I actually did that by a hair. Hurry up. U-turn again. Oh, uh-oh, not fast enough. No, it wasn't.
[10148.87s -> 10214.54s]  Dude, oh! Did I get it? Smash the pipe! Not bad. That was as good as you could do. That it? Perfect. Is that not five stars? That's three stars. Alright, that's like a times 20 or times 30, didn't it?
[10223.20s -> 10288.72s]  Why don't we take a look? First try. That's the first time I've done a first try. Felt pretty good. Felt pretty good. That was way more impressive than just going through it. Landing on it and then driving off of it. I went flying. That guy wasn't even looking.
[10289.72s -> 10334.45s]  The guy forgot to say, and go! Start firing! Be part of the scene, man! They didn't even know I was coming. That was really good. I'll take it. Alright, here comes the turn.
[10334.45s -> 10359.98s]  And the fate of the world hangs in the balance. Who answer the call? We come in peace. Blazing the trail of justice in a land of corruption and terrorists at the foreign corners of the globe.
[10359.98s -> 10380.30s]  Bring me the weapons or I kill the hostages. This nation has nowhere else to turn. If those newts reach American soil, we'll all be glowing. They are their only hope. See you in hell.
[10383.01s -> 10385.01s]  The guy that narrates the movies in the movies?
[10405.51s -> 10407.51s]  That was the second time somebody went through the glass.
[10414.06s -> 10430.08s]  There you go. What up next is? Here are some odd jobs. Armor All. Let's do the Armor All commercial.
[10450.17s -> 10452.17s]  Wait, why?
[10454.17s -> 10469.75s]  No, after your car is nice and clean, drive into other cars. Armor All. That doesn't sound like something I should be doing.
[10492.06s -> 10494.06s]  It's a metaphor, I get it.
[10501.83s -> 10517.57s]  It's just a metaphor.
[10525.19s -> 10528.19s]  I remember getting very distraught over this mission as a kid.
[10529.19s -> 10532.00s]  There's a lot of hard turns.
[10533.00s -> 10554.87s]  It's a lot of left, left, left, left. Scrape. No. More drifting. Ok, I got it.
[10562.51s -> 10569.21s]  Let's all go to drift.
[10570.21s -> 10576.68s]  That was alright. Ooh, I still got it.
[10577.68s -> 10580.56s]  That was a pretty cool stunt.
[10590.44s -> 10595.24s]  This one's tough.
[10600.76s -> 10603.25s]  Yeah, you do kind of have to nail it.
[10604.25s -> 10623.05s]  Turn left. Scrape the vehicle.
[10623.05s -> 10627.00s]  One. Action.
[10627.00s -> 10632.96s]  It's that scrape that's hard to get.
[10632.96s -> 10635.26s]  Turn left. Scrape the vehicle.
[10635.26s -> 10639.08s]  Hit the boxes.
[10639.08s -> 10644.14s]  Watch out. Big drift here.
[10644.14s -> 10646.14s]  All the way around from the car.
[10646.14s -> 10650.36s]  What? That was not a drift through there?
[10650.36s -> 10652.36s]  And cut.
[10652.36s -> 10655.31s]  I really felt like it did that.
[10655.31s -> 10657.31s]  I was drifting into it.
[10657.31s -> 10659.31s]  Three. Two. One. Action.
[10659.31s -> 10668.52s]  Too slow.
[10668.52s -> 10682.03s]  If anything that was like too fast.
[10682.03s -> 10684.03s]  It's okay. In. In. In. In.
[10684.03s -> 10702.84s]  I don't care.
[10702.84s -> 10706.56s]  I want to see what's in front of me.
[10706.56s -> 10708.56s]  What are you talking about?
[10708.56s -> 10715.77s]  So it's one, two, three.
[10715.77s -> 10722.43s]  Save the slow mo for the replay.
[10722.43s -> 10724.43s]  You don't have to show me from the cameraman's perspective.
[10724.43s -> 10729.10s]  I want to see it from my perspective.
[10729.10s -> 10731.10s]  Hit the jump.
[10731.10s -> 10742.81s]  That one's going to get me every time.
[10742.81s -> 10752.28s]  Damn it.
[10752.28s -> 10756.51s]  This one's got me.
[10756.51s -> 10758.51s]  This one's got me.
[10758.51s -> 10772.32s]  It does. It's got me.
[10772.32s -> 10796.62s]  It's better.
[10796.62s -> 10798.62s]  Shit. One more.
[10798.62s -> 10806.65s]  That's it. What?
[10806.65s -> 10808.65s]  Strike the truck?
[10808.65s -> 10810.65s]  I thought I had to jump.
[10810.65s -> 10812.65s]  Oh no. No.
[10812.65s -> 10815.66s]  No. No.
[10815.66s -> 10817.66s]  Three. Two. One.
[10817.66s -> 10819.66s]  Action. Strike the truck.
[10821.66s -> 10823.66s]  Damn it.
[10823.66s -> 10825.66s]  I was so focused on doing all this I forgot that it's part two.
[10827.66s -> 10829.66s]  It's alright.
[10829.66s -> 10835.42s]  Oh no. No. No.
[10835.42s -> 10837.42s]  No. No. No.
[10837.42s -> 10848.41s]  I'm losing it.
[10848.41s -> 10850.41s]  Jump through the gap.
[10850.41s -> 10852.84s]  Blasphemy is so much of a pain in the ass.
[10852.84s -> 10865.90s]  I agree.
[10865.90s -> 10890.33s]  One. Two.
[10890.33s -> 10892.33s]  One. Action.
[10892.33s -> 10894.33s]  Strike the truck.
[10894.33s -> 10896.33s]  Strike the truck.
[10896.33s -> 10898.33s]  Hit the jump.
[10898.33s -> 10900.33s]  Don't strike it. Armor off.
[10900.33s -> 10902.33s]  Be gentle. Strike the side of the truck.
[10902.33s -> 10920.64s]  I want that guy
[10920.64s -> 10922.64s]  fired on the sim.
[10922.64s -> 10924.64s]  That guy will never work another day again in Hollywood.
[10924.64s -> 10929.24s]  Neither will that person.
[10929.24s -> 10943.50s]  Again.
[10943.50s -> 10946.06s]  That's...
[10946.06s -> 10948.06s]  I have to slide
[10948.06s -> 10950.06s]  into that fucking guy.
[10950.06s -> 10952.06s]  And I don't even know when he comes out.
[10952.06s -> 10963.16s]  Hit the jump.
[10963.16s -> 10965.60s]  One. Action.
[10965.60s -> 10970.08s]  Pain in the ass.
[10970.08s -> 10972.08s]  Strike the truck.
[10972.08s -> 10974.08s]  Strike the truck. Strike the truck. Strike the truck.
[10974.08s -> 10996.48s]  That's bullshit.
[10996.48s -> 10998.48s]  Unbelievable.
[10998.48s -> 11000.48s]  You've got to be kidding me.
[11000.48s -> 11002.72s]  There's no...
[11002.72s -> 11004.72s]  I can't even believe that happened.
[11004.72s -> 11006.72s]  I have no...
[11006.72s -> 11008.72s]  It's fine.
[11008.72s -> 11010.72s]  I can't let it bother me.
[11010.72s -> 11012.72s]  One. Action.
[11012.72s -> 11014.72s]  I'm not going to let it bother me.
[11014.72s -> 11021.18s]  I'm good.
[11021.18s -> 11023.18s]  One. Action.
[11023.18s -> 11066.04s]  Very.
[11066.04s -> 11068.41s]  One. Action.
[11068.41s -> 11071.10s]  Strike.
[11071.10s -> 11090.48s]  Strike.
[11090.48s -> 11110.24s]  Strike.
[11110.24s -> 11119.84s]  Which one?
[11119.84s -> 11125.53s]  Okay, I did it.
[11125.53s -> 11136.35s]  There were a lot of trucks to pick from there.
[11136.35s -> 11141.79s]  Three hundred and forty.
[11141.79s -> 11149.85s]  These commercial ones are much harder than the base game.
[11149.85s -> 11151.85s]  It's a nice game.
[11151.85s -> 11177.56s]  Replay.
[11177.56s -> 11179.56s]  Sometimes it just seems like the elements are out to get your car.
[11179.56s -> 11181.56s]  That's why there's armor.
[11181.56s -> 11183.56s]  Tireshines for the wheels.
[11183.56s -> 11185.56s]  Washing wax for the exterior.
[11185.56s -> 11187.56s]  And protecting wipes for the inside.
[11187.56s -> 11189.56s]  They'll give your car that
[11189.56s -> 11191.56s]  armor-all protection to make sure it
[11191.56s -> 11193.56s]  looks its best and stays that way.
[11193.56s -> 11195.56s]  Armor-all.
[11195.56s -> 11209.24s]  Armor-all.
[11209.24s -> 11214.11s]  Stare.
[11214.11s -> 11220.62s]  Go ahead.
[11220.62s -> 11229.00s]  Stare.
[11229.00s -> 11233.36s]  That was definitely one of the employees of this game company.
[11233.36s -> 11238.41s]  So if you have like
[11238.41s -> 11240.41s]  a twenty-nine to thirty-one second spot,
[11240.41s -> 11242.97s]  definitely make sure that you have
[11242.97s -> 11244.97s]  a twenty-nine to thirty second
[11244.97s -> 11246.97s]  voiceover line.
[11246.97s -> 11248.97s]  That was eleven seconds of dialogue.
[11248.97s -> 11251.21s]  Or just
[11251.21s -> 11253.21s]  make it a fifteen second commercial.
[11253.21s -> 11256.09s]  You can't
[11256.09s -> 11258.09s]  get some marketing guy to write
[11258.09s -> 11260.09s]  an extra few lines.
[11260.09s -> 11263.98s]  You waited way too long.
[11263.98s -> 11265.98s]  Alright, there's one more here. I feel like this is going to be very hard.
[11280.72s -> 11282.72s]  Navigate through the course.
[11282.72s -> 11284.72s]  Crashing through each crate and passing under the semis.
[11284.72s -> 11286.72s]  The trick is knowing how to
[11286.72s -> 11288.72s]  control your drifts on the ice.
[11288.72s -> 11290.72s]  And keep your eye out for those under the
[11290.72s -> 11292.72s]  semi-stunts. They'll be tough marks
[11292.72s -> 11295.15s]  to hit.
[11307.15s -> 11309.15s]  Jump right off the bat.
[11309.15s -> 11311.15s]  Only a hundred thousand. This is not that long.
[11311.15s -> 11313.15s]  Only a hundred thousand points.
[11335.77s -> 11346.97s]  Boy oh boy.
[11348.97s -> 11350.97s]  This is gonna be
[11350.97s -> 11352.97s]  one that I
[11352.97s -> 11354.97s]  probably don't do.
[11359.15s -> 11364.27s]  I can't go slow though.
[11393.26s -> 11395.26s]  You don't have to go that fast. I can drive with it.
[11407.93s -> 11418.24s]  This one's not long. I can do it.
[11418.24s -> 11423.36s]  To recite this word more
[11423.36s -> 11425.36s]  in this video later.
[11425.36s -> 11427.53s]  Yeah, I may play the same thing
[11427.53s -> 11429.53s]  like a thousand times. I can't talk.
[11432.80s -> 11435.61s]  I can't talk.
[11444.36s -> 11449.55s]  Nope. Nope. That's it.
[11449.55s -> 11451.55s]  No, it's not. Oh my god.
[11451.55s -> 11453.55s]  I'm gonna be stuck here.
[11456.17s -> 11460.97s]  Just slow it down. Don't have to go fast.
[11475.18s -> 11485.93s]  My tongue was out of my mouth that whole time.
[11502.06s -> 11505.00s]  No. I have to beat it. I have to.
[11505.00s -> 11507.00s]  I can't not do this.
[11525.45s -> 11528.84s]  I'm gonna turn the voice off.
[11528.84s -> 11530.84s]  I think I have to disable voice for this.
[11550.14s -> 11552.14s]  Don't go out of bounds. It's the ice.
[11552.14s -> 11556.04s]  Holy god.
[11556.04s -> 11558.04s]  Oh, that sucks.
[11558.04s -> 11561.69s]  That really sucks.
[11561.69s -> 11563.69s]  Going through that second semi, you gotta go fast
[11563.69s -> 11565.69s]  enough and then there's the ice right there. You gotta...
[11565.69s -> 11567.93s]  I give up.
[11567.93s -> 11596.91s]  What the fuck?
[11596.91s -> 11598.91s]  You gotta go really fast through that
[11598.91s -> 11601.34s]  last screen. You have to
[11601.34s -> 11603.34s]  lead that target too.
[11603.34s -> 11605.34s]  I have to drive in a straight
[11605.34s -> 11607.34s]  line like 200 feet in front of that semi.
[11615.21s -> 11617.21s]  I can do it.
[11625.26s -> 11633.71s]  Excuse me?
[11633.71s -> 11680.17s]  It didn't go fast
[11680.17s -> 11686.64s]  enough. I can't even get
[11686.64s -> 11701.10s]  through the first one anymore.
[11701.10s -> 11703.10s]  That's
[11703.10s -> 11706.67s]  insane.
[11706.67s -> 11710.57s]  That's insanity.
[11710.57s -> 11712.57s]  You just gotta get lucky to do this one.
[11712.57s -> 11717.31s]  I'll do it after like another
[11717.31s -> 11725.88s]  200 attempts.
[11725.88s -> 11762.41s]  There we go.
[11777.21s -> 11779.21s]  I can see it in chat and it's fucking
[11779.21s -> 11782.92s]  messing me up.
[11782.92s -> 11784.92s]  Stop spamming. It hurts my eyes.
[11784.92s -> 11794.20s]  That's bullshit. I fucking drifted.
[11794.20s -> 11819.48s]  I can't...
[11819.48s -> 11821.48s]  I'm gonna have a fucking meltdown from this one.
[11821.48s -> 11824.30s]  You wanted
[11824.30s -> 11826.30s]  a meltdown? You might get one soon.
[11826.30s -> 11828.86s]  I don't know how much longer I can
[11828.86s -> 11845.37s]  handle this as a human.
[11845.37s -> 11847.37s]  Oh, please.
[11847.37s -> 11867.45s]  He's
[11867.45s -> 11869.45s]  under the semi. He's gotta control
[11869.45s -> 11874.70s]  this drift. I had
[11874.70s -> 11876.70s]  it too. That was the end. That's the turnaround.
[11876.70s -> 11884.12s]  What a good break from playing
[11884.12s -> 11886.12s]  the regular game to do like this
[11886.12s -> 11888.12s]  hard bullshit levels.
[11888.12s -> 11890.12s]  This ain't even a commercial.
[11890.12s -> 11899.47s]  I'm drifting in there. I am.
[11899.47s -> 11901.47s]  How do you expect somebody
[11901.47s -> 11904.09s]  to do that?
[11904.09s -> 11906.09s]  I'm drifting. And if I drift too much, I just
[11906.09s -> 11908.09s]  fly out of the goddamn playing area.
[11908.09s -> 11915.45s]  What are you on about,
[11915.45s -> 11917.45s]  game? How do you expect me to do
[11917.45s -> 11931.60s]  that? Oh my god!
[11931.60s -> 11933.60s]  Oh my god!
[11933.60s -> 11936.01s]  You see what I'm saying?
[11936.01s -> 11938.01s]  You see what I'm talking about, right? You understand.
[11938.01s -> 11942.94s]  You get it. You guys get
[11942.94s -> 11952.22s]  me. You do. You get me.
[11952.22s -> 11954.22s]  I know you guys always got my back.
[11954.22s -> 11975.79s]  I love just looking over here and just seeing everybody's
[11975.79s -> 11989.10s]  got my back here.
[11989.10s -> 11991.10s]  This music playing over and over again
[11991.10s -> 11993.10s]  too is not helping.
[11993.10s -> 12021.37s]  Hey! What?
[12021.37s -> 12111.29s]  I turned it off.
[12111.29s -> 12113.29s]  Uhhhh!
[12113.29s -> 12115.92s]  Why?
[12115.92s -> 12148.49s]  It's so hard.
[12148.49s -> 12150.49s]  I gotta get it. I will. Eventually
[12150.49s -> 12156.00s]  it'll happen. Didn't even give me
[12156.00s -> 12214.62s]  them. It's actually
[12214.62s -> 12216.62s]  impossible. It's impossible to do that. It's
[12216.62s -> 12218.62s]  not possible to do that last semi.
[12218.62s -> 12221.69s]  I don't think it is. I think this is a developer joke.
[12221.69s -> 12227.32s]  That's a developer joke.
[12227.32s -> 12233.21s]  Because you have to drift
[12233.21s -> 12235.21s]  out of that. And then
[12235.21s -> 12237.21s]  you can't straighten up yet. There's no
[12237.21s -> 12239.21s]  way. It's not possible.
[12239.21s -> 12245.93s]  It's a fucking developer joke. I'm gonna try
[12245.93s -> 12247.93s]  this one more.
[12247.93s -> 12251.90s]  I get further the quieter
[12251.90s -> 12275.90s]  this frame.
[12275.90s -> 12283.44s]  He's very
[12283.44s -> 12285.44s]  Two. One. Action.
[12285.44s -> 12287.44s]  He jumps on the trailer, then
[12287.44s -> 12289.44s]  down to the ice below.
[12291.44s -> 12293.44s]  Can he hit everyone?
[12293.44s -> 12303.48s]  Two. One.
[12303.48s -> 12305.48s]  Action. He jumps on the trailer,
[12305.48s -> 12307.48s]  then down to the ice below.
[12309.48s -> 12311.48s]  Can he hit everyone?
[12313.48s -> 12322.96s]  One. Action.
[12322.96s -> 12324.96s]  He jumps on the trailer,
[12324.96s -> 12326.96s]  then down to the ice below.
[12326.96s -> 12329.84s]  Can he hit everyone?
[12329.84s -> 12337.39s]  He's gotta
[12337.39s -> 12339.39s]  control this drift. Can he make it
[12339.39s -> 12341.63s]  under the semi?
[12341.63s -> 12343.63s]  Can he hit every
[12343.63s -> 12351.36s]  One.
[12351.36s -> 12379.64s]  One. Action.
[12379.64s -> 12389.76s]  He jumps on the trailer, then
[12389.76s -> 12391.76s]  down to the ice below.
[12391.76s -> 12405.26s]  Can he make it under the
[12405.26s -> 12410.51s]  semi? Can he hit
[12410.51s -> 12413.77s]  everyone?
[12413.77s -> 12415.77s]  The one. Action.
[12415.77s -> 12442.78s]  He jumps on the trailer, then down to the ice below.
[12442.78s -> 12444.78s]  Can he hit everyone?
[12444.78s -> 12446.78s]  The one. Action.
[12446.78s -> 12499.04s]  ice below I can't I can't change the language change one action he jumps on
[12499.04s -> 12511.20s]  the trailer then down to the ice below can he hit everyone and under the semi
[12511.20s -> 12517.56s]  he's gotta control this drift can he make it under the semi can he hit
[12517.56s -> 12525.68s]  everyone under another semi watch this 180

[12694.65s -> 12699.67s]  ambulance one or a firefighter one
[12701.23s -> 12705.43s]  okay overdrive is a street crime movie set in today's San Francisco okay it's
[12705.43s -> 12710.11s]  one of those throwback movies to the 70 exploitation films bombs car chases
[12710.11s -> 12714.43s]  afros hot chicks windsurfing space shuttle okay you kind of get where I'm
[12714.43s -> 12717.39s]  going with this we're gonna go big with this one we might as well even just call

[12742.39s -> 12747.07s]  the smash mouth leads there really unsafe with insane stunts as many as you can squeeze
[12747.07s -> 12750.87s]  together into one run okay so you get behind the wheel I'll get behind the
[12750.87s -> 12754.71s]  camera and hey guys let's have some freaking fun out there okay where is

[12763.11s -> 12767.23s]  an overdrive kid character wise you'll mostly split your time between the loose
[12767.23s -> 12771.35s]  cannon cop stone and the ruthless drug lord Varga we'll have you in one scene
[12771.35s -> 12775.83s]  with a bulky fire engine that can cause serious damage two scenes with stones
[12775.83s -> 12780.11s]  custom-made muscle car the claw cool two scenes on a high-powered street bike
[12780.11s -> 12786.83s]  and one with the MVX Spartan a European sports I like that one the films said in
[12786.83s -> 12790.47s]  San Francisco with lots of steep hills and tight alleyways
[12790.47s -> 12793.83s]  Rodina was known for pushing the envelope in his action scenes so you'll
[12793.83s -> 12797.39s]  have your hands full with some complicated lines including a great
[12797.39s -> 12801.89s]  scene on a cargo ship and a massive jump from a parking garage roof that ends
[12801.89s -> 12806.55s]  with you smashing into a helicopter excited yet come on let's get to work
[12806.55s -> 12812.56s]  Rodina wants to start with the movies final chase you'll double for Vargas in
[12812.56s -> 12816.56s]  a hijacked firetruck there's a tricky line that starts with a drift left why
[12816.56s -> 12820.36s]  do I know what you mean the drift smooth you said this guy's sounds like
[12820.36s -> 12825.68s]  he's speaking from SUV as you exit the alleys other end then turn left plow
[12825.68s -> 12829.76s]  through the gas station and hit the semi I know what you mean by this crash to
[12829.76s -> 12835.04s]  stop the back end of the trailer not the middle it's that way you'll turn the
[12835.04s -> 12838.12s]  trailer and keep barreling forward
[12870.81s -> 12876.05s]  I smashed into that that was a smash
[12883.81s -> 12905.52s]  I told you I was not having this thought
[12912.99s -> 12923.19s]  this is like going from toad to Bowser I play all I play with toad and Kuba
[12923.19s -> 12932.10s]  turbo I don't play with Donkey Kong Bowser and this is why I like that's
[12932.10s -> 12937.10s]  like 2,000 hours in Mario Kart and now you make me play fucking
[12937.10s -> 12955.56s]  good
[12959.89s -> 12993.54s]  another drift fucker don't get angry don't say the upward again it's too far
[12993.54s -> 13033.40s]  away what how am I getting X's I want to see that again I need to see this is
[13033.40s -> 13038.44s]  all this is just GTA it really is it's just oh I took I took a fire ambulance

[13091.50s -> 13097.02s]  dumpster you're as big as the hallway you're as big as that you're I'm as big
[13097.02s -> 13101.98s]  as that thing is tall I just know why you know I'm saying how is that even

[13153.82s -> 13188.56s]  end of the mission I'm dumb I thought I screwed something up this is makes me
[13188.56s -> 13204.20s]  want to play GTA 5 and just drive around in the fire truck whenever I do the
[13204.20s -> 13223.84s]  casino stream my car of choice will be the fire truck notorious all right is
[13223.84s -> 13227.88s]  the muscle car in this scene you'll double for stone in the Claudine chasing
[13227.88s -> 13232.40s]  a gang member through the city a key stunt is the trolley overtake you'll
[13232.40s -> 13237.16s]  drift hard left next to the stadium then take a jump onto the main street that'll
[13237.16s -> 13241.04s]  get you to the trolley tracks really guess it so you can pass the first
[13241.04s -> 13245.32s]  trolley then turn quickly to the right to avoid crashing into the second trolley
[13245.32s -> 13257.80s]  head-on I just I smell like heat I don't smell bad I don't I'm not like don't
[13257.80s -> 13268.80s]  smell bad I smell like warm like heat my body is just emanating just fire

[13866.29s -> 13870.67s]  on his bike escaping a sting operation this scene happens right before he
[13870.67s -> 13876.29s]  hijacks the fire truck in Big Red the challenge here gap between two cars move
[13876.29s -> 13880.97s]  quickly to the ramp and jump the trolley aim your landing to overtake the cop
[13880.97s -> 13885.17s]  after you hit the ground then top it off by sliding under the low-flying
[13885.25s -> 13920.34s]  helicopter this all happens very quickly so it's gonna be about that's a really
[13920.34s -> 13947.63s]  hard left bad what that was good I couldn't control
[13955.53s -> 13961.48s]  okay I don't want to hold on I think you see what happens
[13961.48s -> 13985.20s]  ready that doesn't it doesn't matter it doesn't just kill you
[13985.44s -> 14009.31s]  action through the gap cleaner than action through the gap trolley red the
[14009.31s -> 14040.03s]  needle well still got it in here I go geez into the trolley wheelie sorry why
[14040.03s -> 14062.92s]  am I apologizing I'm sorry guys cut me off I'm sorry I got it I can do it
[14062.92s -> 14080.12s]  oh shit where where's the next part
[14113.76s -> 14119.94s]  where did it all go so wrong I didn't get hit by that which I
[14119.94s -> 14132.81s]  almost did and then what happens that's this is fine that was done fine where
[14132.81s -> 14135.81s]  does this go so wrong
[14171.16s -> 14188.08s]  oh sorry screaming there's too much but really though how are you supposed to go
[14188.08s -> 14208.16s]  up there go through the window in the jump leads you right into the wall okay

[14264.75s -> 14305.50s]  do that did it what window I have to move on I have to get out of here before I die
[14305.50s -> 14313.94s]  that's slumping back into the seat because I got you getting an accident
[14313.94s -> 14318.46s]  and the accident doesn't make you fall off the bike just delayed reaction a
[14318.46s -> 14322.26s]  few seconds later you fall backwards you just pass out from the extreme
[14322.26s -> 14336.19s]  stress of the situation but you can't believe you're still alive and you faint
[14336.19s -> 14350.21s]  I didn't get it I've made that on the back tire though where's the panic try
[14350.21s -> 14355.32s]  to do the objective is coming up here go through the trolleys oh shit I'm gonna
[14355.32s -> 14379.02s]  just hurt myself to do this here it comes what was that I made it through
[14379.02s -> 14387.82s]  though I may have like skinned my whole body but I made it through I hope that
[14387.82s -> 14392.38s]  makes it into the trailer please have one of those make it into the trailer
[14392.38s -> 14409.33s]  you know this AI in the algorithm here is gonna pull a random scene with
[14409.33s -> 14414.62s]  something like that happens it's gonna be so funny in this scene you'll play
[14414.62s -> 14419.08s]  stone again as he's ambushed by SUV driving hit squads the feature stunt
[14419.08s -> 14424.16s]  will be a reverse 180 getaway you'll turn into a narrow alley then two SUVs
[14424.16s -> 14429.00s]  will block your path slam on the brakes and reverse back the way you came as you
[14429.04s -> 14432.80s]  enter the main street spin the car all the way around so you can drive forward
[14432.80s -> 14436.24s]  into the next alley and escape your pursuers you know what Rodino said
[14436.24s -> 14441.40s]  about making stone tough this is your last shot to give him some balls
[14443.56s -> 14455.01s]  pre-rendered a million points this is the real deal
[14455.61s -> 14517.28s]  oh I thought I had to turn right apparently not for the glass what I got
[14517.28s -> 14560.00s]  it yep the gap yeah I did it nope don't happen not happening
[14560.56s -> 14605.87s]  then I go too high no he knocked me over action was do that's not bad I got
[14605.87s -> 14614.19s]  did you see what happened that guy watch this replay the first car and that was
[14614.19s -> 14621.44s]  explosion they can't be a human in there watch how fast this gets ripped off the
[14621.44s -> 14651.32s]  screen beginning wasn't that bad that was bad placement their RNG placement
[14651.32s -> 14689.38s]  where that was gonna land physics-based what oh that was good
[14689.38s -> 14703.97s]  tell I wanted to go right there but yeah there that yeah I'll take that over the
[14703.97s -> 14727.75s]  original should get some style points there three three three this is called
[14727.75s -> 14733.19s]  snitch this scene happens at the start of the movie when stone chases down a
[14733.19s -> 14737.83s]  bike pump who's hopped up on Vargas new drug you'll double for the pump the key
[14737.83s -> 14742.27s]  to this run is another well-timed slide after a hard drift right you'll
[14742.27s -> 14747.15s]  accelerate up a steep street and pass close to a police car then you'll slide
[14747.15s -> 14751.35s]  to dodge beneath another cop car as it comes over the hill and flies straight
[14751.35s -> 14755.11s]  toward you the vehicle could take your head off so be careful and make sure you
[14756.11s -> 14758.11s]  trying to do that though
[14762.91s -> 14769.69s]  this one sounds hard
[14776.40s -> 14790.60s]  oh shit
[14808.31s -> 14832.50s]  hey oh well I didn't even like see it all right

[14861.81s -> 14872.94s]  it's okay you gotta go you gotta hug the left side
[14891.24s -> 14908.68s]  good physics made no sense there
[14909.68s -> 14929.88s]  the person's still in there what what
[14938.11s -> 14956.62s]  tells me that should not have been like that
[14957.62s -> 14966.92s]  I fell down like four times like that view
[14966.92s -> 14999.98s]  I'll fix it
[15017.00s -> 15037.84s]  nothing about that seemed correct thank you gnarly for the five minute subs
[15037.84s -> 15045.68s]  came in right there a minute ago thank you gnarly five subs bring to the final
[15045.68s -> 15051.88s]  mission of overdrive how do I get four on this and not four on this one or this
[15051.88s -> 15057.44s]  one all right this is the super fast car in this scene you'll play a stone whose
[15057.44s -> 15062.44s]  commandeered Vargas is prized European sports car the MVX Spartan the major
[15062.44s -> 15067.44s]  stunt comes at the end you'll shoot across two rooftops then take a huge jump
[15067.44s -> 15071.44s]  and smash into a helicopter in mid-flight you'll need to gun it going
[15071.44s -> 15075.44s]  into your first jump or you won't have enough speed make sure you're lined up
[15075.44s -> 15079.44s]  and throttle it hard the rest of the way trust me kid pull this off and you'll

[17105.00s -> 17110.16s]  psyche of our hero outside he is shooting wristwatch missiles avoiding
[17110.16s -> 17115.28s]  crotch table saws making big-breasted women moan with animal pleasure but
[17115.28s -> 17119.64s]  inside he is spitting at the gods despairing over the absurdity of

[17126.88s -> 17130.88s]  do not see how you can make it out that is because you are a simple man who

[17163.86s -> 17167.90s]  the ramp onto the bridge railing the trick is to keep yourself mostly
[17167.90s -> 17172.94s]  parallel to the railing when you jump don't go too fast or turn too sharp on
[17172.94s -> 17176.50s]  the railing overshoot and crash into the ravine

[17384.55s -> 17390.39s]  okay that seems like it was a cross up there
[17392.63s -> 17405.98s]  all right part of me thinks I'm playing an action game
[17410.22s -> 17445.82s]  turn the fucking motorcycle left gotta go so much more action
[17446.82s -> 17485.32s]  and I didn't even get it I didn't even get it unbelievable why I have to go
[17485.32s -> 17488.16s]  faster
[17507.80s -> 17520.31s]  stupid-ass no I the snow just killed it's like times 10
[17520.31s -> 17530.63s]  action you land on the snow and you may as well just drift into the fucking wall
[17531.51s -> 17559.71s]  I'm holding that one part right there to delete it from him action delete that
[17559.71s -> 17562.95s]  part from the game like fucking shave that off
[17562.95s -> 17605.90s]  Wow he hit me directly with that 180 in the snow 180 in the snow through the gap
[17605.90s -> 17621.43s]  180 in the snow don't go too fast oh shit the box
[17627.58s -> 17636.68s]  that wouldn't even that bad that wouldn't even that bad that wouldn't
[17636.68s -> 17681.71s]  even that bad three with two X's that hit someone that's weird see right it I
[17681.71s -> 17686.71s]  barely that director commentary here while I was on this bike I had almost no
[17686.71s -> 17690.63s]  control of this the director actually told me just close your eyes when you do
[17690.63s -> 17694.03s]  this part because you may as well it's gonna be the same thing whether or not
[17694.03s -> 17706.30s]  you open or close your eyes so I was like yeah you know that makes sense he's
[17706.34s -> 17711.35s]  such a great director though oh I love him he's so smart he's one of those real
[17711.35s -> 17717.01s]  smart directors
[17717.01s -> 17721.33s]  chasing the enemy spy through the base we've got a great stunt plan near the
[17721.33s -> 17725.85s]  missile silo when the explosion blocks the path between you and the lead you
[17725.85s -> 17730.29s]  turn and go back the way you came the platform above you will collapse
[17730.29s -> 17735.61s]  creating a ramp dead here the falling platform throw another with a 180 drive
[17735.61s -> 17739.89s]  up the ramp to the second level try not to lose speed in your turn so you can
[17739.89s -> 17760.15s]  avoid the falling road keep up with the lead you're gonna rush this guy spy if
[17760.15s -> 17773.46s]  you manage to give them I assure you just Mario jump he just super Mario one
[17773.46s -> 17799.84s]  jumped in the air do you want me to do scrape my gun huh holy I did it I did
[17799.88s -> 17804.32s]  that I buried that was so I did it perfectly I did that I'm so that's of
[17804.32s -> 17842.18s]  anything I did that shit you saw my wheels go up my wheels went down going
[17842.18s -> 17894.27s]  faster than the other actor I was looking at you now you'll get over here
[17894.27s -> 17983.74s]  get over here my god land guardrail good good start good start under what here
[17984.62s -> 18007.21s]  oh that's very hard you should have said very hard oh no it's gonna collapse on
[18007.21s -> 18021.58s]  me I didn't know when they're gonna come up it's you gotta like trial and error
[18021.58s -> 18036.01s]  play the match fucking ten times before you know what to do yeah right yeah
[18036.01s -> 18057.84s]  right miss not happening I'm so much of a better actor I can drive so much faster
[18057.84s -> 18111.98s]  than both of you land good all right I'm good this next part sucks good I hit
[18112.02s -> 18130.76s]  the 180s why you here why here comes up on you too quickly and all these sounds
[18130.76s -> 18166.77s]  I'm gonna lose my fucking mind in here guys you know what no he's coming right
[18166.77s -> 18192.79s]  out of three no I don't want to have a load again
[18199.19s -> 18206.96s]  sorry give me three attempts and that's it I promise three attempts and we're
[18206.96s -> 18217.79s]  done no bullshit either every attempt is an attempt even if like oh I fucked up
[18217.79s -> 18220.87s]  right here no every attempt is an attempt three
[18220.87s -> 18309.24s]  attempts to get to three stars every attempt is an attempt my god I that's
[18309.24s -> 18314.64s]  one that's one that's it that's one no I'm done after the two more of these
[18314.64s -> 18324.91s]  inside that little area it's so hard to get like a drift you have what amounts
[18324.91s -> 18347.46s]  to like a studio apartment to fucking turn around I just forgot that was even
[18347.46s -> 18412.03s]  here oh fuck object to smash drift I'm trying to keep the string going oh I
[18412.03s -> 18426.04s]  fucking my mouse just fell down that's so hard to get in the right spot man
[18426.04s -> 18438.18s]  that's too hard to do that you need to be so precise shit this is the last one
[18438.18s -> 18467.46s]  on a dime like that shit right you dumb motherfucker just ruined everything this
[18467.46s -> 18486.86s]  was decent it was a decent run you blew everything you'll never work in
[18486.86s -> 18533.60s]  Hollywood again it's alright this is possible still there's no fucking way I
[18533.60s -> 18540.30s]  don't think anyone can do that no one how do you drift turn into that and go
[18540.30s -> 18583.51s]  up on two wheels and do this fuck that level next you'll double for crown as
[18583.51s -> 18587.95s]  he chases his rival over a frozen lake there's a tricky line as you exit the
[18587.95s -> 18592.11s]  base jump onto the roof then keep gunning it as you make the second jump
[18592.11s -> 18597.07s]  over the base wall soon as you land hit your nitrous switch and speed through
[18597.07s -> 18601.59s]  the narrow pass ending with a big jump over ravine you'll be going too fast for
[18601.59s -> 18612.68s]  big turns so pick your line early and only make small adjustments not
[18612.68s -> 18633.15s]  complete it didn't finish right through here Jesus around again in a circle
[18633.15s -> 18647.44s]  through here in ice fucking ice I'm not even controlling the car
[18647.44s -> 18684.34s]  dude oh boy all right all right slow down don't go that fast I'm gonna be
[18684.34s -> 18714.33s]  drifting all over the place now what what it's nice it's slippery it's
[18714.33s -> 18731.39s]  slippery I technically did it it's all right I I did it I technically drifted
[18731.43s -> 18788.38s]  in the right spot I wouldn't be that bad I can't talk now where down here I got a
[18788.38s -> 18808.57s]  bolt of this turn I'm still in a turn dude it's so slippery oh thank you for
[18808.57s -> 18827.08s]  saving me guy just like going sledding nobody I don't have any control of this
[18827.08s -> 18855.98s]  car I could take like one or two ice levels you can't have a whole zone based
[18856.10s -> 18889.56s]  around ice levels I'm sorry I just want to finish the damn thing trying oh you've
[18889.56s -> 18894.92s]  got to be fucking kidding me you've got to be kidding me that's just that's
[18894.92s -> 18901.59s]  angering no matter how you say it I top that's it's infuriating no matter how
[18901.59s -> 18915.96s]  you look at it I went faster on the rebound there than I did in holding down
[18915.96s -> 18930.22s]  acceleration and snow this is a Mario maker loving this is I played this one
[18930.22s -> 18952.89s]  already and I'm not gonna lie I really think I could control a car better than
[18952.89s -> 18958.40s]  this in real life on a full ice lake it's like they dialed up the slipperiness
[18958.40s -> 18991.30s]  by like six hundred percent just paved the fucking road can I get a road paver
[18991.30s -> 18998.19s]  who drives around on snow like this no one does this not even in the movies
[18998.23s -> 19012.05s]  they drive on roads we're driving down a mountain this no one drives on this I
[19012.05s -> 19033.44s]  want to bring up the something that somebody said earlier they said this
[19033.44s -> 19041.40s]  level made them quit the game forever I can see why that happened 14 year old
[19041.40s -> 19075.19s]  fucking version of that guy whoever you were it's a bug on my fucking eye it
[19075.19s -> 19088.76s]  really is I wish face game is on a fly just like landed in my eyeball it's in
[19088.80s -> 19139.29s]  my mouth that's it I did it I had to have done it
[19140.29s -> 19178.43s]  god I did action you were too far away launches me further then I can launch
[19178.43s -> 19190.07s]  myself
[19190.07s -> 19212.08s]  done truck come on keep going I can feel it in my body when it happens this just
[19212.08s -> 19237.08s]  like I'm not turning the car all right here we go
[19237.08s -> 19245.44s]  you can't turn I gotta go slower over that you can't turn the car I wish you
[19245.44s -> 19247.88s]  could play this I wish you got give this to you right now so you'd be like oh
[19247.88s -> 19253.08s]  shit okay I get it I see what you mean by that just you play it just take it for
[19253.08s -> 19257.20s]  a second you'll see and you're gonna be like oh fuck man yeah this sucks asshole
[19257.20s -> 19280.69s]  and then I'll be like I know right man we go like yeah like high five let us
[19280.73s -> 19312.69s]  click that was bullshit this just wasn't fair I went too fast this time let it go
[19312.69s -> 19323.46s]  off the fucking rails here how do you do that how is it I do I should have
[19323.46s -> 19328.38s]  failed that that's why this game don't make no sense I should have failed
[19328.38s -> 19367.32s]  right there but I didn't okay here we go okay I have to be like on the right
[19367.32s -> 19414.35s]  side I did all the actions I did every action I did I could be here I can sit
[19414.35s -> 19418.03s]  here and just be like I believe but what the fuck my stupid hard games fucking
[19418.03s -> 19426.12s]  dip no let's do it let's just hang out you know trying to get together you

[19469.44s -> 19482.15s]  okay here we go was that enough speed I'm trying not to go so fast yeah no it's
[19482.15s -> 19489.11s]  insane you have to you could you can't turn so even if I try to turn the car
[19489.11s -> 19496.44s]  even a little it doesn't I have to go in the same the car can't be the car can't
[19496.44s -> 19530.34s]  be turned so you have to be but you need speed it's harder than secure how many
[19530.34s -> 19542.34s]  attempts is this how many times did I do the final boss in secure 57 this is like
[19542.54s -> 19546.34s]  attempt number like 30 or 40 at least right and why did I didn't land in the
[19546.34s -> 19593.15s]  box I guess cleaning in now you got I got gamer neck right now I'm leaning in
[19593.15s -> 19643.69s]  deep with like a tilted crushed like Brockas Sora's neck punch it please I

[19698.31s -> 19700.93s]  sweating
[19707.69s -> 19712.01s]  next level is worse next to where I had I hated this one next one is worse next
[19712.01s -> 19714.29s]  one's worse
[19714.29s -> 19718.57s]  as a chopper smashes into it fire missiles at the clips and knock some
[19718.57s -> 19807.56s]  glaciers into grounds okay 180 on ice too much too I can't imagine making
[19807.56s -> 19811.91s]  these levels even playing them and being like yeah people will like this this is
[19811.91s -> 19821.88s]  good anybody in the studio have any fucking hair left oh no it's all patchy
[19821.88s -> 19870.24s]  everyone's like ripped it all out that's fine this damn movie hey your
[19870.24s -> 19893.28s]  movie sucks this thing's gonna flop day one no no no no no no no way not
[19893.28s -> 19895.04s]  possible I don't know I'm gonna try to do it anymore
[19895.04s -> 19904.97s]  that's just not possible no one can do that I don't think anybody could what
[19904.97s -> 19953.16s]  were they thinking that's not fair man that's not fair it really isn't I just
[19953.16s -> 19956.80s]  want to get to the end of this visit level I'm gonna do whatever it takes to
[19956.80s -> 19986.44s]  just get like 10 points who cares no what a spy would not drive on ice he
[19986.44s -> 19991.08s]  would get a fucking ice pick goggles and a ski mask and he would climb the damn
[19991.08s -> 19995.28s]  mountain and bring a tent and shit and that's how we would infiltrate that's
[19995.28s -> 19999.58s]  how we would get away because he'd be smart he wouldn't be stupid and drive
[19999.58s -> 20012.70s]  like 80 on fucking ice James Bond didn't do this it was smarter than that and why
[20012.70s -> 20023.40s]  is your entire base made out of ice where is this supposed to be where it
[20023.40s -> 20045.44s]  why is this here there's a base here nobody can try fun yeah even they can't
[20045.44s -> 20054.16s]  drive on the setting of Goldeneye gold he's the keys the ski jumper whatever
[20054.16s -> 20082.66s]  the fuck the things are called he used a snowmobile he didn't use a streetcar I'm
[20082.78s -> 20088.90s]  you have to go faster than this ship no fucking way you go that fast you ain't
[20088.90s -> 20097.56s]  gonna make it and a million years throw 180 yeah okay this is a developer joke
[20097.56s -> 20141.03s]  whole thing have to be ice the whole course Sonic racers didn't even have this
[20141.03s -> 20147.27s]  shit Mario Kart doesn't even have a level like this across the entire like 16
[20147.27s -> 20180.18s]  Mario Kart games cartoons don't even have this shit no I don't want to watch
[20180.18s -> 20186.74s]  it instant replay I want to like be out of this terrible terrible very awful bad
[20186.74s -> 20199.19s]  place I'm waiting for like the guy to come out of the closet with a camera hey
[20199.19s -> 20204.40s]  we just want to let you know we got you our streamers get bad that whole ice
[20204.40s -> 20207.52s]  level the whole thing was made from the ground up just to fuck with you really
[20207.52s -> 20214.00s]  no way yeah I mean it's such a dogshit level the whole thing so it's not real
[20214.00s -> 20218.97s]  look over there there's a camera over there too oh in the corner no way how
[20218.97s -> 20236.42s]  long has it been there for you know a few months oh okay we don't keep any
[20236.42s -> 20255.62s]  other footage that we've recorded don't worry please just get me to the end I
[20255.62s -> 20267.24s]  just please get me to the end of this level this not a chance and help that
[20267.24s -> 20309.83s]  you can do that what 180 and then reverse just want to get to the end I
[20309.83s -> 20313.07s]  just want to get to the end I don't care about anything I just want to get to the
[20313.07s -> 20328.04s]  end I just want to get to the end this doesn't look fun oh I can tell you with
[20328.04s -> 20333.96s]  a hundred percent certainty it isn't so don't worry about that it doesn't look
[20333.96s -> 20358.61s]  like that because it isn't touch play operation with the cars too what's up
[20358.65s -> 20385.74s]  with that oh worse manure you gotta play operation with the cars on ice put on
[20385.74s -> 20394.58s]  easy there are no difficulties of this game this only ice there's just ice
[20394.58s -> 20402.55s]  there's nothing on you got ice and then you got a car there's no other there's
[20402.75s -> 20444.08s]  only one difficulty it's ice has anybody completed this fucking game can I look
[20444.08s -> 20456.56s]  at like the global trophies have more people beat orphan that have done this
[20456.56s -> 20461.77s]  level I can't imagine fucking just playing this casually and then going
[20461.77s -> 20493.58s]  like well I'll never do this again like that guy like that one guy earlier all
[20493.62s -> 20498.63s]  right let this be like a game design 101 lesson for you guys this is how you get
[20498.63s -> 20506.31s]  people to break their discs you make a whole entire area based on slippery ice
[20506.31s -> 20534.78s]  in a driving game what is I want to know what the last mission is here does the
[20534.78s -> 20545.40s]  game uninstall itself after this part slowing down doesn't help because you
[20545.40s -> 20603.77s]  need to get there in a certain amount of time no operation oh my god no no
[20604.13s -> 20621.62s]  no no I'm gonna skip this level I would rather no nevermind I can't even I can't
[20621.62s -> 20631.98s]  even give you a reason to have this what's the last area what it has to be
[20631.98s -> 20641.15s]  like did they just go back to like formula this is out fucking rages
[20641.15s -> 20665.34s]  you can't imagine doing this on ps2 oh my god no way this there was a lot of sad
[20665.34s -> 20671.39s]  kids when this came out people were probably crying I imagine myself tears
[20671.39s -> 20686.97s]  screaming down my eyes crying as like at like 17 and whatever so the handbrake
[20686.97s -> 20695.62s]  just slides you across the whole entire map this is it for this month I'm
[20695.62s -> 20735.05s]  skipping this level I'll come back to it god just get up there how much how far
[20735.05s -> 20753.74s]  you have to reverse hey can I tell you this I'm bad at the game joke is and I
[20753.74s -> 20763.98s]  got four stars oh get out of here this bad at the game joking needs to stop
[20763.98s -> 20817.38s]  stop leave me alone I hope the next area is you run don't have a car I clearly
[20817.38s -> 20839.41s]  had no idea what I was doing here and that holy shit there's more oh no oh no
[20839.41s -> 20843.23s]  okay fresh start
[20862.27s -> 20875.28s]  no I'm gonna relax we're just gonna relax and I'm gonna get it done just
[20875.28s -> 20880.55s]  calm down and play right just play it that's all right nothing there's no
[20880.55s -> 20913.53s]  problem just relax that's all right it's okay I wasn't supposed to do that I'm
[20913.53s -> 20956.22s]  supposed to do it like that this one is just a mess okay no I'm fine scrape this
[20956.22s -> 20967.40s]  guy does he that he already got scraped actually did that all right I can do
[20967.40s -> 21001.22s]  this he was a ghost he was a ghost he was a ghost I had that too I actually
[21001.22s -> 21034.86s]  had that I didn't miss replay that all right let's go melt downstream melt
[21034.86s -> 21077.10s]  downstream melt downstream melt downstream that was two wheels wasn't
[21077.10s -> 21120.99s]  very long but it was two wheels oh that's fine I don't care what it is that
[21121.99s -> 21141.88s]  like the wise words of vault boy says good enough wise words I don't want to
[21141.88s -> 21158.97s]  see the replay either it's like across the room oh no no no no easy easy if I
[21158.97s -> 21167.90s]  accidentally click a few buttons I might stop screaming what was I trying to do
[21167.90s -> 21172.63s]  with this I don't remember all right this next one's a hovercraft this is the
[21172.63s -> 21195.02s]  final one wait did I just give myself a debuff a hundred percent more
[21195.02s -> 21229.10s]  slipperiness that's okay I got it we're gonna it's it's too light to cause
[21229.10s -> 21237.53s]  screams you know I mean I got it all out of me I'm not upset at anything and that
[21237.57s -> 21253.53s]  is a fun level I'm just gonna do it why the arrows are pointing in almost every
[21253.53s -> 21309.44s]  direction that's a jump on the wreckage up here oh hard very hard that one get
[21309.44s -> 21334.64s]  in that box and then inside the box unbelievable that's in the box whatever
[21334.96s -> 21353.30s]  just get in the box just get in the box just go into the box we still have one
[21353.30s -> 21366.84s]  more area after this and I'm I accepted with open arms the only way they would
[21366.84s -> 21370.24s]  make this worse was it was like anti-gravity like with the spaceship for
[21370.24s -> 21407.37s]  the next stunt so anti-climactic going over this every time okay almost there
[21407.37s -> 21434.82s]  all right into the box here we go line it up there we go that's it it's in that
[21434.82s -> 21456.79s]  was not even remotely as bad as that third level just watch the movie night
[21456.79s -> 21511.19s]  Avenger unlocked so the last area coming up I'm almost done with the game if this
[21511.19s -> 21520.42s]  movie has more than 12% on rotten tomatoes I'll eat a pair of shoes the
[21520.42s -> 21552.94s]  whole thing I'm gonna check it I'm not even in this movie yeah all right guys
[21552.94s -> 21565.68s]  enter the Avenger am I prepared for this hey kid Howard
[21565.68s -> 21569.12s]  right man look you know who I am that's my wall of fame work with everyone tell

[21577.60s -> 21580.84s]  at pyramid Sarah go with it what is she anyway you've heard of night avenger
[21580.84s -> 21584.40s]  right huge comic book well we're making that fan screamed for it for years but
[21584.40s -> 21587.76s]  it was trapped in development hell when I told pyramid I wanted it they've shown
[21587.76s -> 21592.44s]  up with me I've got Murphy on the line sir great tell him I'll call him back in
[21592.44s -> 21597.28s]  40 seconds you've got a decent resume after shock overdrive whooping to ride
[21597.28s -> 21601.80s]  that Baxter screw up and his friends what a mess can't believe it grows 200
[21601.80s -> 21606.68s]  mil mr. Wrightman's last film gross 600 that's true sir she's great with numbers
[21606.68s -> 21610.40s]  wardrobe's got a problem latex suits sir too much well I just lost in snakes
[21610.40s -> 21614.28s]  versus my guy next to me my friend the jokes are fucking empty at moment I'm
[21614.28s -> 21617.92s]  sorry I'll make sure you're known as the best in the world let me down and well
[21617.92s -> 21621.76s]  Jack here he was directing summer blockbusters before he got on my bad
[21621.76s -> 21625.72s]  side but now we get along splendidly right Jack you're incredible mr.
[21625.72s -> 21630.36s]  Wrightman see you on set it's like we'll not rewind that like make it funnier
[21630.36s -> 21635.56s]  snake you've come in this first scene you'll double for night Avenger when he
[21635.56s -> 21640.68s]  spots Big Top's gang on a crime spree the focus stunt is an aerial gap through
[21640.68s -> 21645.08s]  the open doors of a helicopter jump across the rooftops fire your weapon then
[21645.12s -> 21649.48s]  get up to maximum speed to take the ramp oh after you've gapped through the
[21649.48s -> 21653.36s]  helicopter and land yeah you'll need to react quickly to avoid traffic and cross
[21653.36s -> 21665.19s]  to the other side of the street I get to wear the suit too nice I don't think I
[21665.19s -> 21697.46s]  could get angry here cuz I get to win I thought that was gonna happen much
[21697.46s -> 21718.64s]  earlier I thought I was gonna be this one here this other cop did it nominated
[21718.64s -> 21747.22s]  for an Emmy really that's so stupid you can't you try action
[21747.22s -> 21833.28s]  Avengers no I just barely made it I can't not a time what do I do that was
[21833.28s -> 21844.50s]  pretty cool I'm okay with two stars at the end tonight here let's watch that one
[21844.50s -> 21868.52s]  so I failed that one collectively come together and find out what
[21868.96s -> 21888.19s]  because you're bald oh all right yeah that makes sense
[21888.19s -> 21937.85s]  yeah like a college film what's next scene I was more like I love the bike
[21937.85s -> 21944.98s]  it is all right you'll double as Night Avenger again trying to stop Big Top
[21944.98s -> 21949.46s]  from killing the mayor the toughest stunt is early in the run take a sharp
[21949.46s -> 21953.90s]  left turn then line up to go beneath the semi trailer with enough speed to jump
[21953.94s -> 21958.62s]  over the cop cars right after then cross to the next stunt box and fire at Big
[21958.62s -> 21966.34s]  Top's henchmen and wipe them out did I tell you that I know Frank Jones the
[21966.34s -> 21971.18s]  leader of the camera he got most of his ideas from me did I tell you that I knew
[21971.18s -> 22002.57s]  okay I'm doing fine um what we talking about I'm right behind him I'm right
[22002.57s -> 22047.82s]  behind him I was going the right way and then you drop the cop car on me and it
[22047.82s -> 22055.91s]  didn't knock me off the bike and put me on the other side of the road honestly he
[22055.91s -> 22065.24s]  might just say at this point try not to die don't die careful don't die this
[22065.24s -> 22117.43s]  will kill you trying to kill you first attempt looked fantastic yeah
[22117.43s -> 22128.95s]  unfortunately see if they edited it up in post edited it edited it edited it
[22128.95s -> 22143.38s]  that is right that's correct somewhere is this Night Avenger or tactical
[22143.38s -> 22168.60s]  intervention they seem to share the same similarities here clown car now
[22168.60s -> 22172.24s]  you'll shoot the other side of the chase where Big Top is going after the mayor
[22172.24s -> 22177.04s]  this time you'll play Big Top the focus is a two-wheeling stunt you'll hit the
[22177.04s -> 22181.12s]  ramp with your driver's side as the tunnel bends to the left make sure
[22181.12s -> 22184.60s]  you're in control when you hit the ramp you're sliding all over the place you'll
[22184.60s -> 22188.76s]  mess up the stunt to wheel it through the zone and a pair of vehicles will fly
[22188.76s -> 22202.69s]  right over your head my character didn't lose all of his hair
[22202.69s -> 22297.20s]  one car fuck wait did he say you hit the mayor watch out you hit the mayor
[22297.64s -> 22337.22s]  what is he doing here it's a dangerous set man fucking usable but it's not my
[22337.22s -> 22346.52s]  stomach god damn it you keep that if you have the two or three days left of
[22346.52s -> 22355.24s]  principal photography we got like four hours left to close principal into the
[22355.24s -> 22358.80s]  city's water supply we take the fuck out of here come to the pier drift hard left
[22358.80s -> 22362.76s]  to fishtail and knock the police car into the water then speed along the
[22363.20s -> 22368.08s]  jump over the water and while you're airborne drop the bounce bomb drift
[22368.08s -> 22412.76s]  right when you land and continue your run watch out for the toys great the
[22412.76s -> 22417.98s]  police car but there was no turn
[22451.03s -> 22496.87s]  throwing overtake here you're supposed to be the best oh no you hit the mayor
[22496.87s -> 22520.02s]  again boomer reflexes it is exploding I did I did every I drove long ways
[22520.02s -> 22546.97s]  against the railing just restarted I went through it I've been in constant
[22546.97s -> 22556.18s]  fucking like laughter this constant stress this whole stream it's been just
[22556.18s -> 22560.26s]  if it's not like stomach stress from laughing it's just like I stress
[22560.26s -> 22615.05s]  constant comment oh there's not a okay I thought those water what oh into the
[22615.05s -> 22617.37s]  building into the building do we really do a wheelie
[22617.49s -> 22726.25s]  both the explosion I did all the ice cream truck where three last two levels
[22726.25s -> 22779.40s]  last for the campaign I think so the two back wheels there sloppy you could
[22779.40s -> 22782.60s]  probably five star on the first speed like I would destroy the first few
[22783.00s -> 22817.84s]  we'll see how much I've improved I'll go back and just do the first few let's go
[22817.84s -> 22823.27s]  only two remain this is with Batmobile and this is the both last two with the
[22823.27s -> 22828.64s]  Batmobile now you'll double as night Avenger chasing big top in the climax
[22828.64s -> 22833.36s]  this focus done is a jump onto elevated train tracks while you're on the roof
[22833.36s -> 22838.40s]  accelerate to crash into a big top helicopter and land on the L hit the
[22838.40s -> 22841.52s]  copter at an angle so you'll be prepared to turn right when you land
[22841.52s -> 22845.96s]  overtake the first train on the left side then veer to the right to avoid the
[22845.96s -> 22851.32s]  second oncoming train this is gonna this is gonna take a few tries I think
[22851.32s -> 22881.63s]  there's almost a million points you told me to kill that guy I what do you mean
[22881.63s -> 23014.88s]  I'm good let me see let me see it I can do it let me see if I can do it
[23014.88s -> 23052.00s]  let me see if I get enough speed going down I don't have to do it like I don't
[23052.04s -> 23057.12s]  have to do it like this why am I doing it the same way I did before here we go
[23057.12s -> 23089.74s]  fuck come on that had to be close that had to be close going through backwards
[23089.74s -> 23135.72s]  would be so awesome I can do it no it would do that that would be before
[23136.08s -> 23207.77s]  it's five minutes by this game is insane what I pressed it it has to happen
[23207.85s -> 23223.24s]  man oh god
[23223.24s -> 23259.09s]  Simpson's hit and run
[23259.09s -> 23262.29s]  Simpson's hit and run
[23262.29s -> 23264.29s]  I'm fucking getting trash bags
[23264.29s -> 23270.32s]  with the green shit all over the ground
[23270.32s -> 23272.56s]  3,2,1 action
[23272.56s -> 23277.36s]  good action
[23277.36s -> 23284.52s]  alright I'm good
[23284.52s -> 23292.20s]  perfect
[23292.20s -> 23310.68s]  five stars let's see it
[23310.68s -> 23314.71s]  oh fuck
[23314.71s -> 23325.76s]  I can make it I can make it I can make it
[23325.84s -> 23328.28s]  I can make it I can make it I can make it
[23328.28s -> 23330.28s]  I'm still on I'm still on
[23330.28s -> 23332.28s]  I got it twice
[23338.64s -> 23340.64s]  oh no
[23340.64s -> 23343.14s]  I got it
[23343.14s -> 23348.07s]  seriously
[23348.07s -> 23357.86s]  look at how good this was
[23357.86s -> 23359.86s]  I was still on the track too I could have made it
[23359.86s -> 23368.56s]  or something
[23368.56s -> 23370.56s]  I cleaned this up good too look at this turn
[23370.56s -> 23372.56s]  that looks so nice
[23372.64s -> 23398.40s]  I got something to say
[23398.40s -> 23400.40s]  for all the stuff that Batman does
[23400.40s -> 23402.40s]  and all the crazy shit you see
[23402.40s -> 23404.40s]  and like oh in this
[23404.40s -> 23406.40s]  car racing movie
[23406.40s -> 23408.40s]  or this game or Batman
[23408.40s -> 23410.40s]  or Superman when he drives the super car
[23410.40s -> 23412.40s]  I don't even know if Superman has a car
[23412.40s -> 23414.84s]  he might
[23414.84s -> 23418.29s]  that would happen
[23418.29s -> 23421.04s]  probably
[23421.04s -> 23423.04s]  you're talking about like a 1% chance
[23423.04s -> 23425.04s]  or like a 0.5% chance
[23425.12s -> 23427.36s]  to do any of these things
[23427.36s -> 23429.36s]  even driving by this person in front of me
[23429.36s -> 23431.36s]  is like a 0.2% chance
[23431.36s -> 23434.18s]  that you'll actually do that
[23434.18s -> 23436.18s]  I'm surprised Batman's not been hit by more trains
[23436.18s -> 23440.53s]  it doesn't matter how good you are
[23440.53s -> 23445.01s]  at driving
[23445.01s -> 23448.92s]  going this 200 feet right here
[23448.92s -> 23450.92s]  not possible like no way
[23450.92s -> 23466.08s]  you will lose
[23466.08s -> 23470.05s]  Superman can fly
[23470.05s -> 23472.05s]  so what doesn't mean he doesn't have a car
[23472.05s -> 23474.05s]  what about Clark Kent
[23474.05s -> 23478.21s]  you think Clark Kent flies around
[23478.29s -> 23481.54s]  three, one, action
[23481.54s -> 23484.68s]  no he's got a car
[23484.68s -> 23489.22s]  he doesn't take the bus
[23489.22s -> 23492.23s]  how much money does Clark Kent have
[23492.23s -> 23494.23s]  he's not like a billionaire but he's probably doing alright
[23494.23s -> 23501.84s]  can't hit the lead vehicle
[23501.84s -> 23506.00s]  Clark Kent as network
[23506.00s -> 23508.56s]  is probably
[23508.56s -> 23510.56s]  what does he work he has like the glasses on
[23510.56s -> 23512.56s]  he has the tie and everything
[23512.56s -> 23526.37s]  somebody look that up
[23526.37s -> 23528.37s]  what does Clark Kent do
[23528.37s -> 23530.37s]  what does Clark Kent do
[23530.37s -> 23537.35s]  maybe he doesn't work on a hotdog stand
[23537.43s -> 23543.38s]  he's a journalist
[23543.38s -> 23547.60s]  journalist journalist okay
[23547.60s -> 23549.60s]  he's a newspaper journalist
[23554.15s -> 23557.22s]  this is where it fucks me up every time
[23557.22s -> 23561.96s]  got it this time
[23561.96s -> 23582.69s]  actor you actor
[23582.69s -> 23584.69s]  you actor you actor
[23584.69s -> 23599.99s]  did I get him
[23599.99s -> 23616.92s]  one action
[23616.92s -> 23618.92s]  five stars
[23618.92s -> 23620.92s]  guaranteed
[23620.92s -> 23623.92s]  I guarantee it
[23623.92s -> 23677.60s]  I still got it
[23677.68s -> 23679.68s]  it was a five star up until that point
[23679.68s -> 23684.10s]  where am I going
[23684.10s -> 23704.39s]  Simpsons hit the run man it's the same place
[23704.39s -> 23707.40s]  alright
[23707.40s -> 23711.62s]  that guy's just fucked
[23711.62s -> 23713.62s]  that was a five star fucking run
[23713.62s -> 23715.62s]  and the stupid
[23715.62s -> 23717.62s]  turn ruined everything
[23717.62s -> 23735.03s]  I guarantee it
[23735.03s -> 23753.40s]  my fucking ass that was bullshit
[23753.40s -> 23757.56s]  I was in there
[23757.56s -> 23759.56s]  you saw it like I'm in there
[23759.56s -> 23761.56s]  I don't even give you that shit
[23761.64s -> 23780.12s]  got it
[23780.12s -> 23791.00s]  boot cap
[23791.00s -> 23814.10s]  that was a big
[23814.10s -> 23850.44s]  final level
[23850.44s -> 23857.27s]  here we go
[23857.27s -> 23859.27s]  okay this is your final scene as
[23859.27s -> 23861.27s]  Night Avenger tears through Big Top's hideout
[23861.27s -> 23863.27s]  a tricky stunt is driving on the
[23863.27s -> 23865.27s]  roller coaster track shoot Big Top's
[23865.27s -> 23867.27s]  henchmen and get on the track
[23867.27s -> 23869.27s]  then drift right around the horseshoe curve
[23869.27s -> 23871.27s]  as you're nearing the end
[23871.27s -> 23873.27s]  take an abrupt left to break through the railing
[23873.27s -> 23875.27s]  then maintain your speed so you'll be set
[23875.35s -> 23877.35s]  I'm the roller coaster
[23877.35s -> 23879.35s]  this is your last chance to impress Mr. Reitman
[23879.35s -> 23881.35s]  give it your all
[23881.35s -> 23883.72s]  okay boys and girls time for the finale
[23883.72s -> 23885.72s]  let's hurry it up so I can start shopping
[23885.72s -> 23887.72s]  for my red carpet tux
[23887.72s -> 23893.09s]  alright
[23914.85s -> 23916.85s]  what do you want me to do
[23916.85s -> 23932.07s]  wow
[23932.07s -> 23934.07s]  that's a lot going on
[23934.07s -> 23936.37s]  you're at it
[23936.37s -> 23959.99s]  go let's go
[23960.07s -> 23974.40s]  oh this is gonna be hard
[23980.49s -> 24025.66s]  gotta go all the way
[24025.66s -> 24037.31s]  NITRO!
[24037.31s -> 24041.92s]  that's gotta be close
[24041.92s -> 24043.92s]  400,000 what was that 5 stars

[25750.10s -> 25752.10s]  I need a where's the nitrous thing
[25752.10s -> 25768.36s]  firework crate
[25768.36s -> 25770.85s]  remote car
[25770.85s -> 25772.85s]  exploding propane tank
[25772.85s -> 25774.85s]  train fire hoop

[25775.93s -> 25789.23s]  should be in special right
[25789.23s -> 25792.36s]  change cars
[25792.36s -> 25796.33s]  here it is nitro box
[25796.33s -> 25798.33s]  alright let's do it here
[25798.33s -> 25804.84s]  right there
[25804.84s -> 25806.84s]  let's get it everywhere
[25806.84s -> 25808.84s]  in front of each one
[25808.84s -> 25813.07s]  I don't know I guess I don't put it there
[25813.07s -> 25815.07s]  can I even do this
[25815.07s -> 25821.02s]  this is kind of menacing
[25838.43s -> 25846.30s]  that did not work at all
[25846.30s -> 25849.88s]  alright how do I change the car that I
[25849.88s -> 25861.72s]  spawn with
[25861.80s -> 25868.33s]  let's try this one
[25868.33s -> 25903.18s]  got it
[25903.18s -> 25905.18s]  of course this is my first choice yes of course it is
[25905.18s -> 25907.36s]  here we go
[25907.36s -> 25913.95s]  the door is open
[25913.95s -> 25915.95s]  the doors wouldn't open the doors are closed
[25915.95s -> 25918.12s]  I need a muscle car
[25918.12s -> 25936.67s]  uh oh
[25936.67s -> 25938.84s]  I need a muscle I need a fast car
[25938.84s -> 25940.84s]  a very very very fast car
[25940.84s -> 25953.71s]  velocity
[25953.71s -> 25955.71s]  that might do it
[25955.71s -> 25960.38s]  let's go with black dragon
[25960.38s -> 25962.56s]  I want a better
[25962.64s -> 25964.64s]  nice bright blue
[25964.64s -> 25968.16s]  alright let's go
[25968.16s -> 25975.20s]  can I do it
[25975.20s -> 25984.67s]  can I actually do it
[25984.67s -> 26002.65s]  blind yourself
[26002.65s -> 26004.65s]  well I did one full revolution
[26004.65s -> 26011.88s]  so that's good
[26011.88s -> 26026.41s]  fix me fix me
[26026.41s -> 26031.60s]  one more let's go
[26031.60s -> 26034.41s]  yes
[26034.41s -> 26036.41s]  it feels really good
[26036.41s -> 26054.78s]  this car has nitro
[26054.78s -> 26060.60s]  wait
[26060.60s -> 26070.84s]  that means I can use the big one right
[26070.92s -> 26087.02s]  ah
[26087.02s -> 26089.02s]  I want the give me this one
[26089.02s -> 26104.75s]  okay good
[26104.75s -> 26110.00s]  of course he's driving around
[26110.00s -> 26112.00s]  he's going into the stands
[26112.00s -> 26138.88s]  oh
[26138.88s -> 26144.38s]  invisible wall
[26144.38s -> 26146.38s]  stunt city that's a cool name
[26146.38s -> 26150.60s]  let's try the explode
[26150.60s -> 26163.32s]  cool
[26163.32s -> 26165.50s]  alright I think that's it
[26165.50s -> 26167.50s]  let me go back and make sure I don't miss anything
[26167.50s -> 26175.29s]  constructor
[26175.29s -> 26177.29s]  what is multi clash
[26177.37s -> 26181.47s]  this is multi player
[26181.47s -> 26191.50s]  we'll do one more on the bike
[26191.50s -> 26193.50s]  did you miss the main story yeah
[26193.50s -> 26201.82s]  I went through the whole game
[26201.82s -> 26203.82s]  I didn't 5 star every level but I certainly
[26203.82s -> 26213.42s]  completed it
[26213.42s -> 26216.04s]  now this is with the missile
[26216.04s -> 26218.04s]  oh yeah he's gonna give up the
[26218.04s -> 26220.04s]  yep he's gonna say do this do that
[26220.04s -> 26222.04s]  oh that's cheating
[26222.04s -> 26226.72s]  no I'm not gonna cheat
[26226.72s -> 26228.89s]  didn't even get it wait
[26228.89s -> 26230.89s]  I went too fast
[26230.89s -> 26251.02s]  no square
[26251.10s -> 26255.84s]  how am I supposed to land
[26255.84s -> 26257.84s]  on top of this
[26257.84s -> 26259.84s]  I'll have to jump over it
[26259.84s -> 26262.59s]  sideways
[26262.59s -> 26264.59s]  a few times
[26264.59s -> 26268.36s]  that counts right
[26268.36s -> 26277.18s]  alright not bad
[26277.18s -> 26279.18s]  through there
[26279.18s -> 26291.26s]  alright come on
[26291.26s -> 26303.28s]  that one did it
[26303.28s -> 26305.28s]  that one was actually really cool
[26305.28s -> 26309.24s]  do I have to watch the 5 star replay
[26309.24s -> 26311.24s]  I mean you kind of have to every time right
[26311.24s -> 26324.56s]  so LTXT error that's
[26324.64s -> 26328.80s]  what's happening
[26328.80s -> 26332.83s]  does anyone actually know the difference
[26332.83s -> 26334.83s]  between a 5 star replay and a regular
[26334.83s -> 26336.83s]  replay you know what I'm trying to say
[26336.83s -> 26338.83s]  is there a different
[26338.83s -> 26340.83s]  thing did they do it better
[26340.83s -> 26348.44s]  bad ending
[26351.20s -> 26355.68s]  I know I can like getting any
[26355.68s -> 26357.68s]  what's the final one here
[26357.68s -> 26362.28s]  I already see frost
[26362.28s -> 26364.28s]  I don't want to do it I do see boat
[26364.28s -> 26373.18s]  jump though I would love
[26373.18s -> 26375.68s]  another one of these games though this game
[26375.76s -> 26377.76s]  is a lot of fun
[26377.76s -> 26379.76s]  just that one level in the ice place
[26379.76s -> 26381.76s]  was nearly almost a meltdown
[26381.76s -> 26384.38s]  I mean it kind of was that's the one thing
[26384.38s -> 26386.75s]  that I didn't like about the whole game
[26386.75s -> 26388.75s]  and as like a 7 to 8
[26388.75s -> 26391.12s]  hour experience
[26391.12s -> 26393.42s]  I would love another one of these
[26393.42s -> 26395.42s]  with updated graphics and better engine
[26395.42s -> 26397.85s]  it would be so much fun
[26397.85s -> 26399.85s]  I want to place the cameras
[26399.85s -> 26403.69s]  imagine you have control of where you can place the cameras
[26403.69s -> 26405.69s]  during the actual scene
[26405.69s -> 26420.48s]  it would be awesome
[26420.56s -> 26422.56s]  shit did I make it I don't think I did
[26422.56s -> 26424.56s]  just barely
[26424.56s -> 26428.84s]  that was close enough
[26428.84s -> 26432.30s]  that was close enough
[26436.89s -> 26456.52s]  alright that's the first
[26456.52s -> 26459.92s]  one star in a while
[26459.92s -> 26461.92s]  so here's what we're going to do
[26461.92s -> 26464.35s]  because it's already been about 7 and a half hours
[26464.35s -> 26466.35s]  I think I want to go
[26466.35s -> 26468.35s]  relax for a little bit
[26468.35s -> 26470.91s]  play full
[26470.91s -> 26472.91s]  rounds of mario young
[26472.91s -> 26475.15s]  I think that's what I'm thinking of
[26484.17s -> 26486.17s]  I'm kind of feeling it right now
[26486.17s -> 26488.92s]  just relax and just chill
[26488.92s -> 26490.92s]  and that's actually probably how we'll do the bits
[26490.92s -> 26493.68s]  because I wanted to do the bits from
[26493.68s -> 26495.68s]  last night as well because they got cut off
[26495.68s -> 26497.68s]  so I think just playing some yasi
[26497.68s -> 26499.68s]  going over the bits sounds like an
[26499.68s -> 26501.68s]  interesting way to chill out and
[26501.68s -> 26506.35s]  end the stream you know
[26506.35s -> 26511.02s]  because we do have a lot of bits to go over
[26511.02s -> 26513.02s]  but that was stunt made ignition it was a lot of fun
[26513.02s -> 26515.02s]  that was equal parts hilarious
[26515.02s -> 26517.02s]  challenging interesting
[26517.02s -> 26519.96s]  that was
[26520.04s -> 26522.04s]  awesome
[26522.04s -> 26526.84s]  I'm really glad I played it
[26526.84s -> 26528.84s]  there is one more thing to look at
[26528.84s -> 26530.84s]  behind the scenes
[26530.84s -> 26532.84s]  cars world stunt awards movie
[26532.84s -> 26535.15s]  I unlocked this what is it
[26548.40s -> 26550.40s]  did Arnold did all that
[26550.40s -> 26553.60s]  oh is he alright
[26553.60s -> 26575.55s]  I can't handle this anymore
[26579.20s -> 26581.20s]  look at how high up he is
[26581.20s -> 26586.12s]  that's like
[26586.20s -> 26588.20s]  5,000 feet in the air
[26588.20s -> 26592.75s]  it would have taken
[26592.75s -> 26594.75s]  like a minute
[26594.75s -> 26598.97s]  for him to fall
[26598.97s -> 26600.97s]  alright I'm out of here
[26600.97s -> 26602.97s]  let's go play some mario yasi
[26602.97s -> 26607.07s]  my stomach is fucking
[26607.07s -> 26609.24s]  killing me give me a second
[26609.24s -> 26613.21s]  well I switch over
[26613.21s -> 26615.52s]  if you take it off we'll see you later
[26615.52s -> 26617.95s]  you will see me again
[26617.95s -> 26621.79s]  on probably
[26621.79s -> 26624.92s]  probably Thursday
[26624.92s -> 26626.92s]  I have a lot of stuff to do over the next two or three
[26627.00s -> 26629.00s]  days so you'll see me again on Thursday
[26629.00s -> 26632.72s]  I have a
[26632.72s -> 26634.72s]  very very very
[26634.72s -> 26637.02s]  interesting stream on
[26637.02s -> 26640.54s]  probably Saturday we'll go Thursday
[26640.54s -> 26643.93s]  Friday Saturday this week
[26643.93s -> 26645.93s]  Saturday will be the movies the
[26645.93s -> 26647.93s]  you kind of star in the movies stream
[26647.93s -> 26649.93s]  not it's not the same game as it was
[26649.93s -> 26652.94s]  before this is completely
[26652.94s -> 26654.94s]  different I had to buy a 360
[26654.94s -> 26657.63s]  for this this is a full
[26657.63s -> 26659.63s]  on obscure ass game
[26659.63s -> 26661.93s]  I didn't even know this existed
[26662.01s -> 26664.83s]  it's called you're in the movies
[26664.83s -> 26668.03s]  it is a bootleg version
[26668.03s -> 26670.03s]  essentially of you star
[26670.03s -> 26672.65s]  we'll see how that goes
[26672.65s -> 26674.65s]  apparently there's like 60 mini games to play
[26674.65s -> 26676.65s]  and you make a movie while you play the mini games
[26676.65s -> 26678.65s]  I don't know but that's what we're gonna do on Saturday
[26678.65s -> 26683.58s]  I have that
[26683.58s -> 26685.58s]  well we'll see how good it is
[26685.58s -> 26689.10s]  but if you take it off
[26689.10s -> 26691.10s]  see you later we'll see you Thursday and if not
[26691.10s -> 26693.10s]  then we'll play some yasi
[26693.10s -> 26696.56s]  and go over the bits
[26696.56s -> 26698.56s]  stay tuned I'll be right back
