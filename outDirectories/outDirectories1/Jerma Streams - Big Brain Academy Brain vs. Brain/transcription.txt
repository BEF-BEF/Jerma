[5.94s -> 27.16s]  Hello. Big Brain Academy is installed. We're not gonna play it yet. Not yet. That was fast. It was.
[27.16s -> 33.34s]  Jump scared you? I'm sorry. I'm just ready to get back into- I'm gonna play one more
[33.34s -> 41.62s]  Picross level and then we're gonna open Big Brain Academy, okay? One final Picross level.
[42.34s -> 52.42s]  Agrabas. Oh shit. I cli- all right, never mind. We're playing Big Brain Academy now, apparently.
[52.98s -> 56.66s]  I- I clicked that button. I did the- I closed it. All right.
[58.52s -> 77.61s]  Big Brain Academy. Brain versus brain. Here we go. Let's go. Big Brain Academy is not brain age.
[78.33s -> 85.64s]  What? What are you talking about? This is not brain age? Wait, how many brain games are there?
[86.28s -> 94.65s]  What do you mean wrong game? I bought the wrong game. Big Brain? Big Brain! What? What are you
[94.65s -> 106.38s]  talking about? There's another one? Brain age is not available on the Switch in North America.
[106.94s -> 118.50s]  This is the one we're playing. Yeah, me. Me. Johnny 500. Okay.
[118.50s -> 125.11s]  Do you feel as if your brain has been a bit more stiff than usual? Well, here at the academy we
[125.11s -> 129.37s]  offer a variety of activities to help you stretch and flex that brain of yours. This game is good,
[129.37s -> 136.12s]  don't worry. Okay. So without further ado, let's get started stretching your brain. To begin,
[136.12s -> 140.52s]  we'll enroll you in the academy. So if you would, tell us about yourself. How old are you?
[140.52s -> 155.16s]  Did I have to fucking ask that question? No, I'm not that old. I'm- I'm like fucking 32,
[155.16s -> 168.70s]  man. I'm like 34. I'm too old. Yeah, I was- I was going on January 1st, 1988. 1987. 1986. 1985.
[168.70s -> 188.63s]  Who cares? Tell us your style. Your occupation. Choose something close to your real occupation.
[188.63s -> 195.72s]  Um, okay. Preschooler, grade schooler, middle schooler, high schooler, college student,
[195.72s -> 207.10s]  student of life. I'm a- I'm a business owner. Self-employed, free agent. I'm a business owner.
[207.10s -> 218.36s]  I'm a business owner, free agent, self-employed office worker. Just combine them. Self-employed.
[218.36s -> 224.14s]  Next up, your catchphrase. You can change this later, so just pick anything that strikes you.
[224.14s -> 236.65s]  Uh, buried in homework. Send help. But you forgot like the crying emoji. Can't say no to candy.
[236.65s -> 245.08s]  I have only one speed and it's easy, does it? That's kind of accurate. Gotta finish strong.
[245.08s -> 255.22s]  I'll do it to- or that. I only have one speed and it's easy, does it? I'll do it tomorrow.
[255.22s -> 260.82s]  How do grown-ups get to have all the fun? It's- it's funny how the ages- the different age groups.
[260.82s -> 266.34s]  This is like for a kid to say this. Is it a lounge day? Why do grown-ups get out of fun?
[266.34s -> 274.50s]  Like a grown-up's not supposed to pick that. Comfort is key. Can't be too careful.
[275.59s -> 283.77s]  It's simple. Be sincere. I like to be liked. Why- we- why make only one mistake? I'm a big-
[283.77s -> 288.01s]  I'm a fan of being a fan. My grandkids are the cutest. Horses are better than people.
[288.01s -> 297.27s]  I like the appearance you prefer while attending our academy. You can change this later as well,
[297.27s -> 318.95s]  so don't fret. Okay. Okay. Gotta- hold on. That's pretty close. Close.
[330.47s -> 348.89s]  That's not bad either. Which one? It's this one. It has to be. Okay, facial hair. No, I don't have
[348.89s -> 370.57s]  facial hair. German, I hate 5 green. All right, I'm done. Also, allow me to introduce our online
[370.57s -> 377.66s]  features. You can compete with others in Ghost Clash. I don't want to do that. Are you comfortable
[377.66s -> 387.35s]  with photographs of bugs? This option prevents photographs of some creepy critters from appearing.
[389.67s -> 399.91s]  But they were- what do you mean bugs? Okay, practice. Let's go. Let's begin by stretching
[399.91s -> 407.43s]  and flexing your brain in practice. Tada! Welcome to practice. It's our specialty here at the academy.
[407.43s -> 414.55s]  If I may, I suggest you start by trying an activity in the identify category. Why not
[414.55s -> 422.31s]  give whack match a try? You can play with either button or touch. I'm gonna play with buttons.
[422.31s -> 439.46s]  Whack the mole with the matching picture. That's kind of depressing. Okay, just click the things.
[439.46s -> 465.75s]  All right. It's easy. All right. I need a face cam for this, don't I? Yeah. No, no, no. I got it.
[467.29s -> 492.87s]  I got- I need- I distracted myself. Fuck. All right. All right. All right. All right. Right.
[492.87s -> 497.13s]  I need a face cam. I gotta put clothes on. Hold on. You guys need to be able to see my face for this.
[497.13s -> 599.75s]  One sec. I just need a shirt. Okay. I'm back. Let me just make sure this looks- all right.
[599.75s -> 627.10s]  Should. How's it look? Do I look all right? Too dark. Why is it so dark? Oh, shit. Hold on.
[627.10s -> 637.24s]  I gotta change the setting here. Hold on. I wasn't planning on this. Put the light on? I do have a
[637.24s -> 649.51s]  light on. Every webcam that's been created is- has some of the worst light controls ever. That's
[649.51s -> 672.97s]  better. All right. Let's go. You ready? This is gonna stay on for Elden Ring anyways. It's a delay.
[672.97s -> 682.22s]  Oh, shit. That's right. Hold on. I gotta fix that. I didn't even check to make sure that that was
[682.22s -> 696.71s]  actually working, by the way. There we go. All right. We actually have to test this to make sure
[696.71s -> 703.27s]  that everything's synced up correctly. Because when you pull a console through a capture card,
[703.27s -> 717.37s]  it just delays it. That's good, right? One, two, three. I did pretty good. All right. One gold
[717.37s -> 738.46s]  lobe medal. All right. This is actually kind of- this is gonna be fun. No. Try to collect all the
[738.46s -> 745.29s]  gold lobe medals. All right. So that was just one- all right. That was a cool thing. Your journey
[745.29s -> 751.45s]  towards impressive big brain bronze scores just began. All right. I'll just keep doing it.
[753.05s -> 761.45s]  Memorize, analyze, compute. Oh, wait. We need to test this. One, two, three, four, five, six,
[761.45s -> 778.58s]  seven, eight, nine, ten. Is it in sync? One, two, three, four, five. No? Videos later? Is it close
[778.58s -> 809.42s]  enough? Game is late. I'm going- all right. Let me try this. One, two, three. One, two, three.
[810.06s -> 821.94s]  Better? All right. Flash memory. Let's try this one. Use the buttons. What were the numbers and
[821.94s -> 877.24s]  symbols? Five, six, six. They're just showing it to me. Six. Oh, okay. I get it. What the fuck? I
[877.24s -> 886.54s]  didn't- what? What? I didn't want to go forward that other way. Dude, I didn't want to go- the
[886.54s -> 904.50s]  button- I pressed the button accidentally one more time. All right. That was fun. Focus up. I'm
[904.50s -> 910.36s]  focusing. I just pressed the- I- by the way, would you like to see the perfect controller?
[914.30s -> 927.94s]  This is perfect in every way. And placement, analog placement, the face buttons. I thought
[927.94s -> 932.26s]  you just got mad at it. Yeah, but I got mad at me because I pressed the button accidentally
[933.32s -> 939.77s]  one more time. I actually think this is- the one thing I would change on this is the triggers
[939.77s -> 944.25s]  I think should have a little bit more give. But placement wise and hand placement, I like it the
[944.25s -> 951.94s]  most. The pro controller. The PS5 controller is the best one, right? I mean, that's simple.
[952.50s -> 1011.66s]  All right. Which one is heavier? I don't know. There's too many things, too many colors.
[1011.66s -> 1023.75s]  There's too many colors. Literally. I can't do this. It's too many different things are on the
[1023.75s -> 1049.59s]  screen. I saw a Mega Mart shirt. Oh, you noticed. That was really cool. I got three medals. Wow.
[1049.59s -> 1054.89s]  There's more? Choose two cards that add up to the number shown at the top.
[1055.45s -> 1107.30s]  So it's just addition. It doesn't matter what animal it is. Oh, that was a nine?
[1119.10s -> 1136.58s]  Um, ah! I can't. Too many colors. Oh my god, he's stupid. No, I'm a visual learner.
[1136.58s -> 1140.50s]  Okay, you- I'm gonna destroy- here's the thing. People are gonna talk all this shit.
[1141.06s -> 1147.62s]  I am going to destroy one of these. And you people are gonna think there's something wrong with me.
[1147.62s -> 1151.64s]  You're gonna think I'm cheating. There's, like, one learning category that I'm gonna do really
[1151.64s -> 1156.20s]  good in and I'm gonna get, like, ultra advanced. Ultra advanced. The rest of these are gonna be,
[1156.20s -> 1164.10s]  like, at a fourth grade level. This is not one of them. This is not one of them. I know this.
[1164.10s -> 1231.45s]  I've had- I've taken this test before. Wait, oh. What? Little one. But that was every single piece.
[1231.45s -> 1243.13s]  Being a visual learner was proven to be bullshit. Only, uh, people made it up.
[1243.77s -> 1259.53s]  Only intermediate. I'm not good at this kind of stuff. Just wait till they get to the fucking
[1259.53s -> 1262.25s]  numbers and I'm gonna destroy it and I'm gonna make you all look foolish.
[1262.89s -> 1267.56s]  How would it look if you looked at it from the direction of the arrow?
[1267.56s -> 1349.50s]  The fuck are you talking about? That one hurts my head. Slow down? Uh, isn't there a timer?
[1349.50s -> 1359.06s]  The timer. Isn't it, like, tick. Tick. Tick. I hear, like, a clock ticking.
[1360.46s -> 1367.43s]  There is a timer. Yeah, there is. Add the missing tracks. All right, let's fucking look-
[1367.43s -> 1433.82s]  let's look like an idiot. What do you mean, add the track? Oh. Oh, I didn't want to press that one.
[1433.82s -> 1438.60s]  I- seriously, it's really sensitive. Um, sometimes I- it's like, I go- it goes, like,
[1438.60s -> 1444.14s]  double or it doesn't go at all. Like, I was trying to move and sometimes it would go, like,
[1444.14s -> 1449.62s]  tick, tick, and tick twice. This D-pad sucks. This controller sucks. It's just got good placement,
[1449.62s -> 1471.19s]  that's all. Oh my god, it's perfect. Uh, yeah, I'll put on sunglasses. Cool. All right, nice.
[1471.75s -> 1486.30s]  So that was memorized. This is analyze. I'm gonna look really bad to a lot of people.
[1486.30s -> 1499.06s]  People are gonna think, like, I'm on drugs or something. Speed sorting. Which picture
[1499.06s -> 1511.91s]  fits the description? Plant. Living. Plant. Fish. Doesn't swim with fins? Wait, what does that mean?
[1511.91s -> 1516.14s]  I don't get it. I don't- what does it mean? Doesn't swim with fins. What does that mean?
[1523.40s -> 1534.55s]  No, I wanted to do the car. What the fuck? The fucking ladybug is not- I could start using the
[1534.55s -> 1563.26s]  analog. That's worse somehow. What was that? Was that a mall screw? It was an eggplant.
[1563.26s -> 1581.08s]  I thought it was a muscle. I want to do that one again. I want to do this one again.
[1582.78s -> 1604.34s]  Ah, okay. I thought that was like a celestial body. What was it? Fins. No! I didn't want to press that.
[1604.90s -> 1628.22s]  For some reason, I didn't think pig was a mammal. I thought it was a trick question for some reason.
[1628.22s -> 1635.86s]  I was like, what is it then? What's- um, I don't know. What else is cold-blooded? A bug's cold-blooded?
[1638.98s -> 1662.36s]  I can't even relax. A bug's cold-blooded? I'm serious. I don't- I don't know. You only hear
[1662.36s -> 1668.28s]  that for like lizards and shit. I don't fucking know. The bugs don't even have blood. They have
[1668.28s -> 1674.41s]  like fucking- they have like cerebral fluid and that's it. Bugs don't have blood? They have like
[1674.41s -> 1698.86s]  a little bit of like juice in their head. Shark is not a fish, I thought. I thought that was a big
[1698.86s -> 1725.70s]  debate. These eat things? No! I thought it said move with legs. What do you mean? A tricycle is-
[1725.70s -> 1751.05s]  What do you mean slower than a bug? Fourth slowest? No! The fucking d-pad sucks!
[1756.58s -> 1760.74s]  I want to go like this way and I go like up left, up left, up left, up left. It's like up left,
[1760.74s -> 1821.19s]  up left, up left. I'm just trying to go right, man. One more try, that's it. Okay, I don't know,
[1821.19s -> 1848.49s]  the octopus laid eggs. Oh, I got it. All right, that was super elite. All right, cool, cool, cool,
[1848.49s -> 1857.91s]  cool, cool. Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go. All right, match blast.
[1857.91s -> 1931.54s]  This is fun, damn. Break blocks to copy the top shape. I get it. All right, that was too hard.
[1933.75s -> 1940.97s]  That was too hard. That was too- that was way too much. Oh yeah, I fucking guarantee if he tried
[1940.97s -> 1944.73s]  to hit me with a sword I could dodge- I could dodge it. I fucking guarantee it. If you had a
[1944.73s -> 1948.17s]  fucking battle axe and you were gonna try to get me with it, you're not gonna get me with it.
[1948.17s -> 1953.13s]  You won't- I'm too fast for you. Way too fast. I would- I would- I would- no way.
[1953.21s -> 1959.05s]  Okay, I am fast as fuck and I have- I have lightning-like reflexes in real life.
[1959.61s -> 1964.17s]  I don't care what some little fucking grasshopper says about how stupid I am.
[1964.81s -> 1970.04s]  You got- you got swing of the axe? I'm fucking gone. Not happening.
[1983.64s -> 1992.47s]  Why- I've been playing too many video games. Like, why is that the first thing I go to? I've been
[1992.47s -> 1998.46s]  playing too much Elden Ring, I really have. I've been playing too many video games. All right,
[1998.46s -> 2056.78s]  how many cubes are there? Three. What the 16 of those? I can't concentrate.
[2058.09s -> 2067.27s]  18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24. I can't concentrate. I can't concentrate. I don't like this one.
[2067.27s -> 2074.60s]  I actually can't concentrate. I'm fine. I'm okay. I just can't concentrate. I'm-
[2074.60s -> 2077.80s]  I have huge concentration problems ever since I was a little child.
[2078.76s -> 2083.13s]  I'm telling you, you got me with an axe! And I'm fucking gonna dodge it.
[2083.69s -> 2103.29s]  Compute. There's more on to memorize. Memo random. Memorize the picture on the car before it flips.
[2103.29s -> 2114.84s]  Which one was it? I should be- I'm gonna do- I'm gonna get super little on this one. Wait, oh,
[2114.84s -> 2133.70s]  it's the one it flips over. Okay, I didn't understand the rules. Oh, fucking come on. I didn't-
[2134.42s -> 2172.15s]  I didn't even fucking look at what it was. Slow down. All right, and I understand- I didn't
[2172.15s -> 2191.14s]  understand the rules at the first few rounds for this. All right, reverse retention. Remember
[2191.14s -> 2271.42s]  the order and answer in reverse. Shit! Did you see the face you're making? I don't care.
[2272.38s -> 2277.69s]  This game is fun and everything, but what would happen if somebody came at this guy with an axe?
[2277.69s -> 2284.49s]  I'll tell you what would happen. They wouldn't hit me. I would be on the other side of the room.
[2285.21s -> 2289.85s]  It would be like Dark Souls in real life. They'd be like, oh, I'm coming this way. And I'd fucking
[2290.81s -> 2300.94s]  dodge it with perfect frame rate. Perfect frame invulnerability. Covered cages. Where are the
[2300.94s -> 2373.50s]  birds? Make the cages go faster if you're up for it. I get it, okay. Already gone. I didn't get to
[2373.50s -> 2393.48s]  super elite? Ooh, he was happy about that one. Legit based elite brain. Thank you. All right,
[2393.48s -> 2401.80s]  okay. All right, so what do I do now? Oh, okay. Practice. Test. Wait, I haven't seen all these.
[2402.52s -> 2409.80s]  All right, here we go. Species. Which animal is there more of? Look around with the spotlight.
[2410.44s -> 2491.53s]  I don't need them. They're the same. Not even super elite. I wonder if this guy could definitely
[2491.53s -> 2528.33s]  dodge battle axe. I could. Which piece belongs in the box? Pay attention. Oh, I didn't want to pick
[2528.33s -> 2567.21s]  that one. I'm getting frustrated. It gives me a fucking headache. I like know it too. I can see
[2567.21s -> 2575.51s]  it, but my brain just can't do it. I can see it. It's just like, it's like mushing it all together.
[2576.07s -> 2582.15s]  I can't. I just can't do it, man. It's just like, it just mushes in my brain.
[2582.71s -> 2589.48s]  It's like I start looking at all of them at the same time. My brain sees all of them and yo,
[2589.48s -> 2602.47s]  I'm dodging that. He's peeking. I'm fine. Fast focus. What is the picture of? How fast can you
[2602.47s -> 2653.27s]  figure it out? It's a rabbit. It's a hippo. Owl. Snail. What? What is it? Is it a dog? It's a dog.
[2656.39s -> 2671.34s]  House. I don't know. A butterfly? What the fuck is that? What is that? Snake. I'll try it again.
[2671.34s -> 2708.50s]  I like that one. That one's fun. Again, I like that one. It's the concrete that fucked me up.
[2717.03s -> 2740.84s]  No, I didn't want to press it. I wanted to press panda. I guess it's a cat. It could have been a
[2740.84s -> 2768.22s]  snail. How the fuck are you supposed to do that? One more. This whole game could be contained in
[2768.22s -> 2773.93s]  a 10 megabyte flash website from 2008. I mean, that's kind of funny what you just said, but
[2775.80s -> 2817.50s]  oh, it's probably seal or fish. Probably seal. Seal. Cow. Giraffe. Ostrich? I don't know what this is.
[2818.30s -> 2847.14s]  I don't think you can blur it any harder. What is that? Fucking panda. I wasn't pretending. I was
[2847.14s -> 2851.06s]  looking at the middle because the panda was facing the other way. It was like the back. It was like
[2851.06s -> 2864.81s]  the back of a panda. I haven't seen a panda very much in my life either. No. All right. That was
[2864.81s -> 2870.81s]  cool. So now we do. There's a couple we didn't do in visualize. I'm going to do this one. Shadow
[2870.81s -> 2917.80s]  shift. Find the pictures that match the shadows. No, I didn't want to click it. The round head.
[2917.80s -> 2948.84s]  Well, it's in there. You got something on the top right of your screen. What is it? Tell me what it
[2948.84s -> 2961.24s]  is so I can be aware of what it is. Okay. I have, I have to read it analog clock. Mallet math. What
[2961.24s -> 2965.40s]  is that? Oh, mallet math. Whack the blocks. You don't need to leave behind the correct total.
[2966.20s -> 2998.01s]  I need four. I'm going to be ugly. Three, six, nine, 12, five, 10, 14, 21.
[2998.01s -> 3016.68s]  Oh, seven, 14, 21, six, six, seven, eight, five, six, seven, five, eight, nine, 10, nine, 10.
[3018.78s -> 3023.10s]  No, I didn't want to do that. Why did it fucking move? I wanted to get rid of the other one.
[3028.73s -> 3036.97s]  21, 21, 21. No, I didn't. I seriously, sometimes it just like goes. I don't not try to press the
[3036.97s -> 3062.07s]  button. You dodged into it. Rotate the clock hands to match the time. Bring forward an hour.
[3062.07s -> 3089.83s]  Fall back 15 minutes. Uh oh. Fall back 30 minutes. Fall back 240 minutes.
[3089.83s -> 3114.84s]  Go forward 120 minutes. Where did I start? Bring forward 245 minutes. Five, 10, 15, 20.
[3114.84s -> 3120.39s]  It's weird on the controller. Look, let me show you what happens. Let me show you what happens
[3120.39s -> 3125.19s]  when I use the, it's weird on the controller. You're supposed to fucking touch that. Like,
[3125.75s -> 3132.73s]  it's weird. Like, I can't. It's really weird on the controller. I swear to God.
[3134.06s -> 3197.13s]  Hop from lowest to highest. Fuck you. Fuck! Negative 80. What? Dude, I fucking hate this
[3197.13s -> 3203.74s]  controls. I'm trying to fucking. I can't start over. Start over. Start over. Start over. Start
[3203.74s -> 3210.57s]  over. This, this D-pad sucks asshole. It's fucking the worst D-pad I've had in any controller.
[3220.98s -> 3295.46s]  Use the analog stick. Analog stick is awful here. Negative 71. Fuck you. I give up. I don't care.
[3295.46s -> 3299.46s]  I, who gives a shit? Who fucking, what does this even matter? Brain. Oh, brain training.
[3300.26s -> 3304.34s]  Who gives a shit? What does this matter? Why does this even matter? Like, this whole thing is,
[3304.34s -> 3310.18s]  doesn't make, who cares? What specific case does it matter if I can pop balloons in a certain order
[3310.18s -> 3315.14s]  if they, like, are tricked to make you look bigger and smaller? You know what is practical?
[3315.78s -> 3320.73s]  I'll tell you what's practical. A guy running at you with an axe and you got nowhere to go.
[3320.73s -> 3326.70s]  That's what I call practical fucking things to know. I'm telling you, dodging, dashing,
[3326.70s -> 3332.62s]  and shit. Like that, oh no. Here comes the fucking battle axe. Open up. One, two, three, four,
[3333.42s -> 3338.46s]  no, you're gone. Sorry buddy. I know practical shit. I don't care about impractical shit like
[3338.46s -> 3350.95s]  counting balloons in a room of various shapes and colors. Let's take the test. Let's measure
[3350.95s -> 3358.81s]  your big brain brawn by having you compete activities in five categories. I'm going double
[3358.81s -> 3437.61s]  headphones. Memorize the numbers and symbols. Repeat them before you forget. All right, identify.
[3438.49s -> 3464.02s]  No. Which piece belongs in the box? Pay attention to the movement. I'm going to,
[3464.02s -> 3591.80s]  shut up. I'm losing points. Number of cubes. The number of cubes. I think I did pretty good.
[3591.80s -> 3641.19s]  All right, let's go with the train one. I was good at this one too. Oops. Oops. I'm fucking,
[3641.75s -> 3669.61s]  I'm flopping here. I had it. I got to move with it. That's how I do everything. All right,
[3669.61s -> 3701.38s]  computing time. All right, that's going to be bad. Put it, sorry. No, I didn't want to go up again.
[3701.38s -> 3748.01s]  Fucking controller. What are you doing? Well done. How'd I do? How was your first test?
[3748.01s -> 3756.60s]  Your test results are reflected in your big brain score. All right, my big brain score is 3,300.
[3756.60s -> 3765.40s]  An average person who hasn't spent time in practice will score about 1,500. So I practiced. So I
[3765.40s -> 3784.39s]  should be somewhere around two or three thousand. 2886. This is a very good score. I'm going to
[3784.39s -> 3795.59s]  give your brain a grade. A plus plus dude. You're getting started. Let's aim for even higher.
[3795.67s -> 3812.58s]  I can't get higher than A plus plus. I told you I was a visual learner. I'm very, my analytics are
[3812.58s -> 3823.64s]  terrible, but I can visualize, compute and identify and attack. I'm going to lay into this.
[3826.81s -> 3834.28s]  I don't need to memorize anything. I don't need to analyze anything. Visualize. It is important
[3834.28s -> 3840.36s]  to accurately perceive that what you see with your eyes. Furthermore, there's room for improvement
[3840.36s -> 3847.59s]  in analyze. I recommend flexing and stretching there. What is analyze? If you can answer a little
[3847.59s -> 3853.61s]  faster, you'll be better. Tell me, have you been collecting gold low metals? I have no doubt you're
[3853.61s -> 3860.92s]  capable of buying more. Well then, it's time to announce your big brain type. This is your brain
[3860.92s -> 3873.11s]  type. Visualizing and computing. See it, compute it, and I can attack it. Visualization and
[3873.11s -> 3898.42s]  computation. Battleaxe brain Andy. That's fun. So I can do more? What is this? I wonder what that
[3898.42s -> 3909.16s]  button does. Try to earn gold medals in every practice activity. Do a ghost clash. I don't think
[3909.16s -> 3916.92s]  I pay for the switch online. I don't think I have it. I'm pretty sure I don't have like, I think I
[3916.92s -> 3930.95s]  stopped it. So wait, this is apparently what I'm bad at. That makes sense. Is it though? I crushed
[3930.95s -> 3943.56s]  this. You had it from Mario Tennis. Didn't I crush this in the actual exam? This was bad. So was this.
[3944.12s -> 3951.64s]  I nailed it. I got to like, super elite. When are you going to play Elden Ring? Well, I'll tell you.
[3952.52s -> 3958.09s]  In literally like, five minutes, ten minutes, I'm going to take a break. It's going to be a long
[3958.09s -> 3963.69s]  break. It's going to be somewhere over 15 to 20 minutes. I'm going to eat. I'm going to chill.
[3965.69s -> 3971.16s]  And come back in about 15 plus 20, just probably about 20 minutes. And we're going to come back
[3971.16s -> 3974.92s]  and play Elden Ring for the rest of the night. So there's going to be an intermission for food.
[3975.88s -> 3982.47s]  Because I started at like one and I want to be able to go till like, you know, 11, 12, 1 a.m.
[3982.47s -> 3986.15s]  I have like a 10 to 12 hour stream, but I want to eat in the middle and go, you know, if I need to
[3986.15s -> 3993.99s]  do things I can. So I'll be playing it in like 25 minutes, 30 minutes. It's going to be a long one.
[3993.99s -> 4003.05s]  Well, the reason, the reason why I did a long stream today specifically, specifically so
[4004.41s -> 4007.21s]  is because I'm not going to be around for the next like week.
[4008.34s -> 4013.14s]  Uh, and I really want to play Elden Ring. So the idea was to break it up a little bit and
[4013.14s -> 4016.66s]  play something else that's not Elden Ring, but I still wanted to play Elden Ring because I'm
[4016.66s -> 4021.06s]  obsessed with it. And I don't want to not play Elden Ring for like the next five straight days.
[4021.86s -> 4027.26s]  You know what I mean? Like I was like, I could have just played this and then like done the
[4027.26s -> 4032.54s]  streamer award stuff because that's this weekend. So that's why I'm not going to be around. So I
[4032.54s -> 4039.88s]  will be, and when we come back, a good question of what I'm going to do after that. I'll be on
[4039.88s -> 4046.52s]  the streamer awards on Saturday. So I'll be hosting it. You'll probably be able to
[4046.52s -> 4053.80s]  pick me out in the crowd. I'm sure you'll see me there at some point walking around.
[4053.80s -> 4064.30s]  I'm also presenting. So I think I'm not hosting it. No, no, but I am. I'm going to be one of the
[4064.30s -> 4071.82s]  presenters. What about baseball stream? Yeah. I got to get, I got to get a good suit and everything.
[4071.82s -> 4075.26s]  Yeah. It's going to take, I need to spend the next day or two getting really ready for this.
[4076.22s -> 4082.25s]  All right. Let me try this again. But yeah, in about 15, 20 minutes, I'm going to take a break.
[4082.97s -> 4118.54s]  It'll be a long one and we'll come back with Elden Ring. No, 16. Why is the controller so bad?
[4118.54s -> 4147.02s]  I just, I, who cares about how many blocks you can count? Who cares? I'm going to do that test.
[4147.02s -> 4221.21s]  I want, I want to do a different one. I don't want to do the block one again. You idiot.
[4221.21s -> 4296.38s]  Got it. Oh, it's too much things. I don't care. No, I want to do the monkey. Yeah.
[4296.46s -> 4304.57s]  Oh, my analytical brain. Oh no. Okay. I can't analyze things. You can't get all,
[4304.57s -> 4378.97s]  you can't have all the infinity stones. Sorry. No, this game. I just, okay. I can't play this
[4378.97s -> 4389.06s]  anymore. Can you guys hear? It's coming out of my speakers. It's literally coming out of like my
[4389.06s -> 4399.14s]  monitor. I, I think I fucked up the whole sound thing. My sound is fucked up permanently. I have
[4399.14s -> 4408.90s]  to play like this until I do, I take the break. I'm going to turn this off because like you can
[4408.90s -> 4480.49s]  hear it here. Do you hear? So whatever. I don't care. I fucked everything up. Almost had it.
[4480.49s -> 4485.67s]  Almost had it. It's too awkward. It's coming through my speakers and I can't fix it.
[4485.67s -> 4493.64s]  I'll turn it up. Can you hear it now? You guys should be able to hear it now.
[4495.72s -> 4511.37s]  At the train to the exit. I think my noise gate is making it so you can't hear it.
[4511.37s -> 4570.60s]  No, wrong controls. Whoa. I thought I was starting on the other side. All right. Let's see if I,
[4570.60s -> 4575.74s]  my brain age went down because obviously, obviously I got fucked up and I was
[4575.74s -> 4584.22s]  under extenuating circumstances with this unplugged. I got a higher score than last time.
[4586.65s -> 4599.98s]  How? A S minus. I got to S. I don't care. I win. Let's take a closer look at the test results.
[4599.98s -> 4609.37s]  I can't stand this, but it has to stay that way. Oh my God. It's a whole chunk of my brain missing.
[4613.19s -> 4622.97s]  What the fuck? I'm not going to improve in analytics. It's not going to happen.
[4630.46s -> 4637.51s]  That sounds so weird coming through here. All right. We're about to take our break
[4638.07s -> 4658.39s]  in just a moment. In just a moment. That's fun. I can't get the weight thing down. L ratio brain.
[4659.03s -> 4666.36s]  Whatever. I have such trouble with this. I always have. You want to talk about,
[4666.36s -> 4671.24s]  okay, wow, dude, your spatial awareness. This is exactly what you should be talking about.
[4671.24s -> 4697.43s]  I have trouble with like, like orientation of stuff. Okay. I'm being analytical about this.
[4697.43s -> 4715.35s]  I'm not, I'm just trying to, I'm not going fast. Okay. Okay. That's better than last time.
[4715.35s -> 4725.03s]  I don't know, dude. I don't fucking know. I don't know. It sounds like you're making
[4725.03s -> 4731.32s]  pop. When is this bit going to end? I'm, I can't plug this back in. This, this took like five
[4731.32s -> 4736.65s]  minutes to get in the right spot behind the monitor so I could hear it. It's not going back
[4736.65s -> 4751.61s]  in. I can't do it. Sounds like somebody's breaking tiles in another room. I'm not going to be able
[4751.61s -> 4762.25s]  to get gold on any of these. Hold on. Let me try to plug it back in. It's such a weird spot.
[4762.89s -> 4770.44s]  I don't think I, do you want to help me plug it in? All right. Here. Go back and play. I just can't
[4770.44s -> 4788.84s]  see. Oh yeah. She got it first try. This is so loud. I got to turn this down. She's like sneaking
[4788.84s -> 4799.93s]  back here. I'll see it a bit. She's like sneaking around. I'll be really honest. I got to be really
[4799.93s -> 4808.15s]  honest. Holy shit. I don't even know how she just did that. I don't think you guys understand.
[4808.15s -> 4815.77s]  There's like, there's like six inches of space behind the desk and she just was like, boom,
[4815.77s -> 4822.28s]  bam, in, gone. That was unfucking believable. It took me like, it took me 15 minutes to get
[4822.28s -> 4835.64s]  this plugged in. She's just fucking there. Isn't she great? That was cute. I love that. All right.
[4835.64s -> 4847.69s]  Just without even being seen either, she's just like gone. Sneak queen. All right. Two, four,
[4847.77s -> 4868.26s]  six, seven. I'm about to throw it into the ground. Oh, she knows how to analyze shit.
[4872.12s -> 4877.32s]  I just can't, I'm sitting there like, I'm sitting there with a plug just going like,
[4877.32s -> 4885.30s]  I don't understand how this goes in there. I just, I can't analyze how it plugs in. I see it's small
[4885.30s -> 4893.90s]  enough to fit in that hole, but where's that hole? It comes in here with an axe. I'm dodging it.
[4893.90s -> 4967.91s]  All right. Start over again. Game's muted. It has to be worth a gold medal. That's a gold medal.
[4967.91s -> 4995.03s]  It has to be, right? Yes. Much better. Yeah. Okay. How about identify? I'll get, okay.
[4995.83s -> 5068.30s]  All gold medals give you something, right? Fuck you. That's gotta be gold, right? That has to be a
[5068.30s -> 5083.96s]  gold medal. That's better than what I had before. Come on. Gold. Are you doing the stream? Yeah,
[5083.96s -> 5093.37s]  I'll be at the stream rewards. Seven, planning on it. Compute. This one's just add up the numbers
[5093.37s -> 5168.07s]  and that's it. Don't do anything else. I fucking can't do this one. I can't. No, I need gold. Do
[5168.07s -> 5254.17s]  it again. Come on. I need 300. Bingo. That's going to be huge. That's the, that's a triple gold
[5254.17s -> 5266.87s]  medal. All right. Come on. This one's weird with the analog. This would be way easier with a finger
[5266.87s -> 5292.39s]  or a stylus. It's time to 12. It's weird. 180 minutes, six, 12. So it's backwards. 80 minutes,
[5292.39s -> 5310.33s]  six. Okay. Backwards, forward, six, 12, 18. So that's three hours ahead. One, two, three, five,
[5310.41s -> 5327.56s]  six, 12. So one, two, 35 minutes, five, 10, 15, 20, 20, 30. All back. Six, 12, one, two, right there.
[5327.56s -> 5342.66s]  Do it. I don't think that's gold. I don't think it's gold. I need to be, I need to do a little
[5342.66s -> 5384.47s]  bit better than that. Come on, man. No, controller. I fucking hate this thing. It's such a shit.
[5384.47s -> 5436.62s]  There's a weird reverb on the mic. It's probably the fan. The fan's blowing into the mic. Is that
[5436.62s -> 5448.60s]  the fan on? All right. That's all golds. I could definitely get gold on this one. I only did it
[5448.60s -> 5543.18s]  once. Yeah. All right. Only two more and I'm good. Okay. I got to focus on this one. Don't be an
[5543.18s -> 5636.62s]  idiot. Fuck you. Do it again. I'm never going to get it. No. Huh? Dude, I don't think I'll ever get
[5636.62s -> 5689.54s]  that one past silver. I need 400. I got to do, I almost had it. I just got to get it quick. Shit.
[5689.54s -> 5713.94s]  No, you kidding me? You got to be fucking kidding me. The fuck, dude? How are you supposed to do
[5713.94s -> 5722.01s]  that? How is it, how is that possible for you to get that in? I don't get it. 100? Oh, wait,
[5722.01s -> 5732.60s]  then the four. This shit is just, I can't do it. My brain just can't process it. I don't think I'm
[5732.60s -> 5754.82s]  ever going to get 400. Dude, it's like the, it's the segmentation that my brain just goes,
[5755.54s -> 5761.91s]  you can't fucking do it. It's the segmented pieces down here that it's like, look, it's done up there,
[5761.91s -> 5812.07s]  mom. It's like, no, I can't, my brain just can't do it. Oh, bro. I don't, I can't, I can't, dude.
[5812.23s -> 5823.86s]  I can't. This is the one thing that I will never be able to do, ever. The segmented pieces become
[5823.86s -> 5833.21s]  one piece in my brain and it's physically not possible for me to do it. Come on, dude. Try
[5833.21s -> 5849.43s]  playing it drunk. That would actually probably help. They're all one piece. They're all one piece.
[5849.43s -> 5856.54s]  My brain is mushing them all together. It's like, I think they're all connected because they're all
[5856.54s -> 5861.80s]  connected. Okay. You know what I wish they would do? I don't want to see the top one. The top one
[5861.80s -> 5866.73s]  is fucking with my head. It's, it's making them connected down here too. Like I'm just going to
[5866.73s -> 5936.31s]  not, I'm going to literally block the top of the screen up. Fuck. It's happening again. Fuck. Did
[5936.31s -> 5977.88s]  I get 400? Let go, let go of me, let go, let go of me, let go of me, let go of me. Okay. Fuck.
[6022.44s -> 6034.39s]  I got how far did I get? Oh my God. I thought I was up really low on that scale. Minus 300. I got it.
[6034.95s -> 6049.91s]  Okay. I got gold on everything. Super practice. In this harder practice, every activity starts
[6049.91s -> 6156.90s]  in the advanced class. This is not happening. No, fuck. Jesus. Bet you can't do that. I'm fucking
[6156.90s -> 6171.96s]  at it. I will see you guys in exactly, exactly, um, like 20 minutes. We're going to take a long
[6171.96s -> 6180.36s]  break. I'm going to come back with Elden Ring. That was fun. This is the end of the first segment
[6180.36s -> 6187.08s]  of this stream. I'm going to eat. I'm going to pee again. I'm going to refill my drink, get a water,
[6187.08s -> 6193.85s]  and I'll be back for Elden Ring. I'm going to play Elden Ring until I'm done.
[6195.77s -> 6200.01s]  So see you in about 20 minutes. I'm going to put text on the screen too, just because
[6200.89s -> 6213.70s]  I want to make sure people know that I'm not coming right back. So let's solve that now.
[6213.70s -> 6221.40s]  That's where it needs to be. Okay. I'm going to add some text on the screen. This is the intermission.
[6221.96s -> 6248.95s]  There you go. I'll see you guys in about 15, 20 minutes. It might even be shorter than that.
[6248.95s -> 6259.34s]  Include where you left. Oh, that's a good part. That's a good idea. I don't know. Yeah. I'll write
[6259.34s -> 6273.93s]  this 15, 20 minute break. I'll say back at six 40 specific. There you go. That makes more sense.
[6273.93s -> 6288.46s]  Let's see how this plays out. So I'll be right back. I'm not going to have any music because
[6288.46s -> 6293.96s]  I don't think it'll, it'll just be looping for like 20 minutes. Let's make this really easy to see.
[6294.60s -> 6305.05s]  All right. I'll be right back. I'll see you guys at six 40 ish. See how this plays out.
[6305.05s -> 6312.68s]  I'm really curious how this works. No, no music. Do random music. Um, I feel like it's going to loop
[6312.68s -> 6319.51s]  the same thing. Yeah, this is, this is, this is all right. All right. I'll be right back. 20 minutes tops, probably less.
