[0.31s -> 13.58s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a gameplay commentary.
[13.58s -> 19.38s]  Not exactly sure what's gonna be in the background. It could be Team Fortress 2, it could be anything really at all.
[19.38s -> 25.88s]  But I'm not gonna really talk about the gameplay. It's gonna be probably a fairly quick video, but I just wanted to make sure that I talked about this.
[25.88s -> 34.99s]  Because it's something I've been waiting for, for years. It's something I've been waiting for since I was probably 15 years old, and it's finally happening.
[34.99s -> 41.49s]  And I want to give it as much attention as I possibly can, and give you the backstory on it, and give you the reasons why.
[41.49s -> 43.30s]  And let's just get right into it here.
[43.30s -> 52.80s]  A lot of you guys know I am a huge fan of The Neverhood, and of Doug Tenable, the guy that made Earthworm Jim. He's the original creator of Earthworm Jim.
[52.80s -> 59.80s]  I'm gonna put a couple links in the description here, and one of them is going to be of my Enlighten video on The Neverhood.
[59.80s -> 66.30s]  And it's a very, very good game. It's probably one of the best games I've ever played, in regards to style, in regards to storytelling.
[66.30s -> 70.30s]  And just, it's bleeding with style, we'll just say that.
[70.30s -> 77.30s]  So if you never had a chance to play it, it's hard to get. I mentioned this in the video, I think you can't really buy it anywhere.
[77.30s -> 82.30s]  You're gonna have to go find it somewhere online. But we'll step away from that.
[82.30s -> 86.04s]  The guy that made The Neverhood is making a new game.
[87.03s -> 91.03s]  The game is called Army Krog, and it has a Kickstarter right now.
[91.03s -> 93.03s]  That's gonna be in the description as well.
[93.03s -> 101.64s]  And the reason why I'm making this video is because this guy, Doug Tenable, this game, The Neverhood, and his new game even,
[101.64s -> 108.14s]  these are the reasons why I got into stuff like voice acting, why I got into film and TV and video production.
[108.14s -> 112.88s]  Seriously, all of this stuff is the direct result of Doug Tenable.
[112.88s -> 117.38s]  And if he's watching this video right now, Doug, you're a fantastic guy, I love all your work.
[117.38s -> 121.88s]  And I want to try to support this project as much as I possibly can.
[121.88s -> 129.66s]  And to transition into this next part of the video, it's the things you love, you never lose sight of them.
[129.66s -> 135.16s]  We all have that thing that we really, really liked when we were younger, or that thing that somebody said,
[135.16s -> 139.97s]  or that somebody did an old friend, or an old thing, an old piece of work, that you never lose.
[140.47s -> 141.47s]  And I'll never lose it.
[141.47s -> 147.47s]  The scenes in The Neverhood and the stuff and some of the things that I've taken as a younger kid will never leave me.
[147.47s -> 152.88s]  This new project that he's working on is just bringing it all back.
[152.88s -> 159.38s]  And I really hope they get as much money as they possibly need to push this project as far as it can possibly go.
[159.38s -> 162.38s]  It's all gonna be in claymation, it's just gonna be just like The Neverhood.
[162.38s -> 166.88s]  I would even say it's a spiritual successor to The Neverhood.
[166.88s -> 169.38s]  The characters are very similar, the art style is very similar.
[169.38s -> 175.38s]  And I can't say enough about this game and how much I can't wait for it to be released.
[175.38s -> 178.38s]  I can't wait to see developments on this game.
[178.38s -> 181.88s]  And that's why I'm backing this game by $1,000.
[181.88s -> 185.38s]  I'm giving $1,000 to the Kickstarter of this game.
[185.38s -> 188.92s]  And I want to give more money than that.
[188.92s -> 197.10s]  If I had the funds, guys, if I was able to donate $5,000, $10,000 to this project, I would do it today.
[197.60s -> 198.60s]  And I just can't though.
[198.60s -> 200.60s]  And that's like the sad thing.
[200.60s -> 209.08s]  I wish I could do more because I'm just so heavily emotionally invested in this game at this point.
[209.08s -> 214.08s]  So if you liked what you saw when you clicked on the link in the description, there's gonna be a bunch of links there.
[214.08s -> 216.08s]  I heavily encourage you check them out.
[216.08s -> 220.08s]  If you liked it, spread this video around, tell your friends about the project.
[220.08s -> 222.08s]  Maybe back it by a couple dollars.
[222.08s -> 224.08s]  I mean, whatever you want to do.
[224.58s -> 230.58s]  And even if you don't, even if you have no interest in this project at all, that's cool too.
[230.58s -> 234.58s]  This is not me telling you, hey, you gotta go back this project now.
[234.58s -> 238.58s]  But as much as I would like to say that, it's just to try to get the word out there about it.
[238.58s -> 242.58s]  Because I'm such a huge fan of everything this guy produces.
[242.58s -> 244.58s]  And maybe it piqued your interest a little bit.
[244.58s -> 246.58s]  That's the goal with this video.
[246.58s -> 249.58s]  But with that, I'm probably gonna wrap it up here, guys.
[250.08s -> 252.08s]  Actually, I completely forgot about this.
[252.08s -> 254.08s]  I wanted to talk about this as well.
[254.08s -> 257.08s]  I passed 100,000 subscribers a few days ago.
[257.08s -> 259.32s]  And I love y'all.
[259.32s -> 261.32s]  You're all amazing.
[261.32s -> 263.32s]  I wish there was more I could say, but there's just not.
[263.32s -> 265.32s]  Everything that you guys have done is incredible.
[265.32s -> 267.32s]  You guys all rock.
[267.32s -> 272.32s]  And I'm going to be doing a very long stream probably this coming weekend.
[272.32s -> 274.32s]  So I want to get some time to prepare for it.
[274.32s -> 276.32s]  Probably gonna be streaming some of my old favorite games.
[276.82s -> 281.32s]  I'm gonna try to play through the entire game of Super Mario RPG.
[281.32s -> 283.32s]  That's probably what's gonna happen.
[283.32s -> 285.32s]  It's tentative to change.
[285.32s -> 287.32s]  But that will happen probably on Saturday.
[287.32s -> 289.32s]  I'm probably gonna start Saturday morning.
[289.32s -> 291.32s]  And go till Saturday night.
[291.32s -> 293.32s]  We'll see how that happens.
[293.32s -> 295.32s]  But I'll make another formal announcement.
[295.32s -> 297.32s]  Just keep a lookout on the Twitter and on the Facebook page.
[297.32s -> 299.32s]  God, I need to start updating my Facebook page.
[299.32s -> 301.32s]  But whatever.
[301.32s -> 303.32s]  We're gonna end the video here, guys.
[303.32s -> 305.32s]  Moral of the story is this.
[305.82s -> 307.82s]  When you love something, you love it.
[307.82s -> 309.82s]  And support it as much as you can.
[309.82s -> 311.82s]  Whether it's a person, a thing, it doesn't matter.
[311.82s -> 313.82s]  Verb or noun.
[313.82s -> 315.82s]  Make sure you love the things you love.
[315.82s -> 317.82s]  And make sure they know that you do.
[317.82s -> 319.82s]  So go give your mother a hug right now.
[319.82s -> 321.82s]  Mommy, come give me a hug.
[321.82s -> 323.82s]  No, you guys understand.
[323.82s -> 325.82s]  But again, that's gonna wrap it up.
[325.82s -> 327.82s]  I'll see you guys all next time.
[327.82s -> 329.82s]  Take care, everybody.
