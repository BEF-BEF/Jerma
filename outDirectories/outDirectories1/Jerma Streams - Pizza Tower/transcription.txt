[9.27s -> 21.94s]  Alright, so this game seems pretty cool. I've seen a couple other streamers play this.
[21.94s -> 41.85s]  Definitely want to check it out at some point. Alright, so we're... I can't... It doesn't
[41.85s -> 54.79s]  like this controller. No. Press start to continue. Controller disconnected. What? What do you
[54.79s -> 70.03s]  mean? Oh, I think I turned the Xbox on. God damn it. Yeah, it's trying to turn the...
[70.03s -> 83.56s]  It's turning the Xbox on again. Give me one second. Let's try this again. Anyways, how
[83.56s -> 94.06s]  are you all doing? What's today's date anyway? Wednesday. I feel like I haven't known what
[94.06s -> 105.42s]  actual day it's been for the last week. Did you play any of the Wario World games? I actually
[105.42s -> 123.20s]  didn't. Alright, what's going on with my controller? Stop it. So this game's about speed running,
[123.20s -> 130.65s]  right? This is about going really fast and getting a big high score. At least that's
[130.65s -> 172.80s]  what it looks like. Let's try this again. Sorry about that. Pizza tower. Hmm. I don't
[173.80s -> 204.12s]  know why it doesn't like this controller. Well, there's that. Start. Did the Xbox app
[204.12s -> 210.69s]  open? I don't think so. Shouldn't be. Oh, the title. One of the mods would make a good
[210.69s -> 228.14s]  title. I trust him. Don't worry. Okay. What the fuck? Why do you hate my controller? Hey,
[228.14s -> 244.55s]  there we go. Alright. How's the audio? Good? Alright. Power status, middle, and then right.
[244.55s -> 256.18s]  What's the difference? What do the three TVs do? Press right trigger. Oh, it's save files.
[256.82s -> 278.94s]  Alright, let's go. I'm ready. The art is just so wild. It really is so cool looking. Okay.
[278.94s -> 307.87s]  Why can't I move? I got art. So jump. It's a run. Okay, welcome. Alright, so where's the
[307.87s -> 330.58s]  up? Alright, up. Alright, so what do I, what do I do? I can't go through here. This game is cool.
[330.58s -> 349.57s]  Alright. Press to jump, hold down, and a direction to crawl. You can break marble and metal blocks
[349.57s -> 357.42s]  underneath you with a body slam. Press down while in the air. Start the body slam from
[357.42s -> 366.99s]  higher to destroy metal blocks. Jump blocks may be hidden. Keep an eye out for them. Press
[366.99s -> 386.05s]  to destroy them. Thousand bucks. The game's a little loud. Got you. I got you. That's perfect,
[386.05s -> 398.16s]  isn't it? Grab dash. Hold dash and jump. Hold right trigger to start a mock run. If you hold
[398.16s -> 407.07s]  right trigger then jump on a wall, you'll start a wall run. Oh my goodness. Alright. Do that while
[407.07s -> 412.98s]  wall running to jump off the wall. Keep right trigger held to stick on the other walls. You
[412.98s -> 427.15s]  can also use the grab dash to start a wall run while in the air. Got it. Is it too low? I got
[427.15s -> 444.54s]  a Goldilocks. Hold on. Okay. Jump after pressing in order to do a long jump. Run up a slope.
[445.18s -> 462.37s]  I like that sound. The volume is too medium. Sorry. Okay, hold that to destroy a block. Okay,
[462.37s -> 477.41s]  yep. Cool. I'm going to puke playing this game. I'm just telling you. Alright. In the air, hold
[477.41s -> 491.33s]  during a mock run. I think I'm going to puke. In order to destroy metal blocks,
[491.33s -> 502.26s]  gain speed by doing the mock run. You can hold to go faster. Running down a slope will make you go
[502.26s -> 524.99s]  faster. Turn while retaining mock run. Press the opposite direction. Okay. Try turning before
[524.99s -> 533.01s]  falling down a hole. You'll retain your speed. Ah, I see. Is that what my buddy Eric wants?
[533.01s -> 546.38s]  Your buddy Eric is very well traveled. While at high speed, hold up then release to perform
[546.38s -> 556.00s]  the super jump. You can also adjust your position with left and right. Ah, okay. So while running.
[557.84s -> 598.38s]  I get it. How do I get out of this? Oh, I know. Oops. Wait to go through gaps faster. Is that
[598.38s -> 612.58s]  working? Press that and then down. Oh, there it is. You can grab things with the grab dash and throw
[612.58s -> 640.11s]  them. Okay. Put these in order to get a better rank. Some can only be acquired during the escape.
[640.11s -> 662.93s]  Okay. Can't go through these. You need to save most of the dudes in the cages in order to advance
[662.93s -> 667.33s]  the next floor. They'll give you money to pay Mr. Stick. If you miss too many of them, you'll need
[667.33s -> 675.54s]  to replay some levels. Alright. Destroy John the pillar in order to open the exit gate. This will
[675.54s -> 711.20s]  reverse the solid pillar blocks. Pizza time. Ooh, it's smooth. Get out now. My eyes. John Gutter Hall.
[711.92s -> 735.36s]  Power lobby. Which one should I go in? Poppins, secrets, treasures, power achievements.
[738.24s -> 760.64s]  All right. I'll just start at the beginning. John gutter. So just go really fast, right? That's all
[760.64s -> 795.23s]  I know. You're not going fast enough. Cheese. Faster. Go faster. Faster. Am I not going fast
[795.23s -> 836.74s]  enough? All right. You're going to go too slow. Got it. Super taunt. What's that? I have a D.
[837.30s -> 853.04s]  How do I get more points quickly? Go faster. I feel like I'm going wicked fucking fast.
[853.76s -> 890.69s]  Back, back, back. No, no, no. This way. Come on. Do it. Go. I'm going way too slow.
[891.49s -> 932.27s]  Why can I get in here? Got it. Killing things give you points. Oh my goodness. I got a B.
[933.07s -> 964.35s]  How much health do you have in this game? Oh, hold on. It's infinite health. Okay. I was like
[964.35s -> 994.53s]  kind of scared. What do I do with this guy? I jumped over it. Whoa. You have found one secret
[994.53s -> 1007.01s]  out of three. This isn't, I'm not going too slow, right? Okay. Make sure I'm not going too slow.
[1011.94s -> 1045.58s]  You're going too fast. Okay. I thought I just blew it. I got it. I got it. I got everything
[1045.58s -> 1081.47s]  I needed, right? I got it. So it actually isn't about speed. Now it is. Who's this guy?
[1081.47s -> 1112.58s]  Okay. I'm so overwhelmed. All right. I'm going, I'm going, I'm going. I got plenty of time. I'm
[1112.58s -> 1162.43s]  fine. Oh shit. Go, go, go, go, go. Hit every wall. You've hurt Pepino 10 times. Why is it saying
[1162.43s -> 1193.33s]  that? Go. No, no, no, no, no, no. I got it. Come on. Give me an A. At least an A. I'm not living
[1193.33s -> 1227.92s]  till I have an A. Bonus of the door. Just leave. Font at the door. Oh, okay. That was stressful,
[1227.92s -> 1239.63s]  but very fun. Oh, I see. I get it. So the idea is you play the same level over and over again
[1239.63s -> 1265.66s]  to get like S speed only matters in the escape. Take your time. Okay. Cool. That's fun. All right.
[1265.66s -> 1270.21s]  Well, now knowing that I can take my time in the first part, what do you know about this tower?
[1270.21s -> 1301.82s]  Who are you? I don't know anything. Can I stop the rap? All right. Cool. I get it. I'm feeling it.
[1301.82s -> 1335.81s]  Now I drop down all the screams. Lame. Why was it lame? I see where to go. All right. That's cool.
[1347.23s -> 1367.92s]  Woo woo. I don't know how to whistle. Woo woo. Whistling is so weird. No, I can't whistle. I
[1367.92s -> 1380.03s]  don't know how. No. Every time I've ever tried to whistle, it's always just never works. I just
[1380.03s -> 1390.08s]  don't get it. Something to do with the way that my mouth and my teeth are. Just I can't do it.
[1391.06s -> 1401.82s]  I will move my lips to go to do it correctly. Tongue behind bottom teeth, lips together.
[1408.59s -> 1420.83s]  Nope. Trust me. I've sat there for hours trying to do it. That's a lie. Who spends hours trying to
[1420.83s -> 1426.03s]  whistle? Every single person either can do it or you can't. Nobody sits there for hours going,
[1426.83s -> 1447.84s]  Oh, get out of the way. I did. You did. I definitely didn't. The guys with the forks are
[1447.84s -> 1466.70s]  annoying. Cheesy. Double jump, double jump and then down thrust. All right. That's pretty sick.
[1473.60s -> 1489.82s]  Uh, okay. Once you're going in direction, you can't stop. You're welcome. Oh, it's damn. You
[1489.82s -> 1508.93s]  actually do get style points. I got to get down the smash the slam thing. Let's grab then throw.
[1509.65s -> 1535.60s]  Is it great? Nope. I'm actually eating pizza right now. Pizza is so good. It really is like
[1535.60s -> 1549.30s]  just like the best thing. I can't, I can't think of anybody that's ever denied pizza.
[1552.19s -> 1554.99s]  Just something you just don't like you can't deny. It's just, yeah, of course.
[1555.95s -> 1587.70s]  Oh, wait, can I get it again? I'll get it. Nice. I go down with it or can I even go down? I don't
[1587.70s -> 1602.82s]  know. I'm already at a B. All right. Now that people are telling me you got to go hurry up.
[1602.82s -> 1632.19s]  You're going too slow. Faster, faster. I already freaked me out. Oh, I need to go get that guy.
[1641.87s -> 1664.94s]  Where is he? Can I take this with me? No, the game feels really fluid though. It's definitely
[1664.94s -> 1670.54s]  got the controls are great. Just one of those games. You have to really get down. I don't have
[1670.54s -> 1687.09s]  it down yet, but I probably will. Yeah. They're very, very good. I want to, I wanted to get all
[1687.09s -> 1702.32s]  those help. Okay. Double jump my lead. No, no, no, I didn't, I missed the points. No,
[1703.28s -> 1724.21s]  I'm, I'm doing too well. Jumping over them. I go back slow. Andy. Hey, I'm okay with a B
[1725.17s -> 1764.67s]  SpongeBob super taunt up and taunt. Okay. Hold up while taunting. What does it do?
[1765.47s -> 1817.57s]  Kill everything on screen. Wait, what about that? Do I get this? Is it all right? Holy shit. The
[1817.57s -> 1832.90s]  music. Yeah, this is really, really good. B rank Barry. Not for long. Call me a rank Arnold.
[1840.16s -> 1859.54s]  That's a good thing to know. I want that. All right. I got this guy now. Can I now go in that
[1859.54s -> 1880.72s]  door? Yes. It's okay. Do it on your way back. I want that sausage. So bad. I get it. Oh my,
[1880.72s -> 1922.00s]  right. I can do the big jump. I forgot secrets. Did I miss something? It's a game. I like it.
[1922.00s -> 1948.82s]  Oh shit. No, I didn't want to do that. It's all right. You make a mistake. I just downloaded
[1948.82s -> 1952.99s]  the game like 20 minutes ago. I swear to God. I just downloaded the game 20 minutes ago. It's
[1952.99s -> 1993.07s]  all right. I just got the game 20 minutes ago. Get out of the way. Get out of my way. Get it.
[1993.07s -> 2035.82s]  What? What? What? No, I go in. Was that a pasta? I'm so happy that they have that person to come
[2035.82s -> 2090.96s]  tell you what to do. What's going on? Stop. Wrong way. Oh my God. Go down. Wait, hold on.
[2090.96s -> 2098.34s]  I have 10 seconds. Get under there. Get go. What is he doing? What are you doing? What are you
[2098.34s -> 2113.94s]  doing? Why? I couldn't, I couldn't duck. I was, what the fuck was that? What happened? I know as I
[2113.94s -> 2121.68s]  crawl, I, I couldn't move. I was trying to do this thing where you like go like this. Oh my God.
[2122.64s -> 2138.38s]  I'm fucking pissed off. Oh my God. I'm so annoyed right now. That's, this is what I'm okay.
[2138.94s -> 2146.24s]  Let me get this down. You can, okay. You can not. It's an analog controller problem.
[2149.04s -> 2154.85s]  All right. So when I use my controller, it's a, it's a controller problem.
[2155.57s -> 2167.02s]  When I go down, this is a controller problem. Use D pad. Okay. You just saved the whole rest of the
[2167.02s -> 2175.57s]  run. Yeah. Yep. It's actually really hard to do that with the analog for some reason. Why are
[2175.57s -> 2190.54s]  you not using the D pad? I don't know because it hurts my hands. Shit. I'm so pissed. The analog
[2190.54s -> 2198.18s]  is nice. It's got like a grip on it. The buttons are like, they're like hard. They push on your
[2198.18s -> 2219.74s]  fingers. I got it. Now I'm not going to get S. Why would you ever assume you're on D pad?
[2223.15s -> 2232.86s]  Yeah, that's so much better. That is actually way easier. He's got arthritis. I mean,
[2232.86s -> 2271.33s]  maybe, maybe a little hard to tell sometimes. This dude's 70. Get an Xbox one fight pad.
[2271.33s -> 2280.67s]  It has a bigger D pad. I do really like the Xbox controller. I think it's, I like the placement
[2280.67s -> 2287.95s]  the best, I think. Out of all the controllers, the Xbox, the, since Xbox one, I want to say
[2287.95s -> 2299.06s]  the placement's been the best for me. I prefer the PlayStation analog sticks and the PlayStation
[2300.02s -> 2318.90s]  um, trigger buttons, but I like the placement of the Xbox better. He's a real Xbox controller.
[2321.49s -> 2324.53s]  Um, I feel like the deep is the D pad worse on the original Xbox,
[2325.17s -> 2328.37s]  get the old one. I feel like the 360 one wasn't that great either.
[2346.06s -> 2377.71s]  All right. Once you hear, once three gulps happen, just stop moving. Oh, stop. Oh, stop it.
[2377.71s -> 2399.23s]  Good. Stop. Okay. That'd be, what's the best way to handle the guys with the forks?
[2399.87s -> 2444.45s]  Parry them? Wait, there's a parry? No, wait, that's a parry. Spoiler. You literally asked.
[2445.17s -> 2471.81s]  I know I'm messing around. Um, did I miss this? I think I missed one of the secrets
[2472.45s -> 2501.09s]  one I got last time. Yeah, I did. That parry is so much better. The secret to the left of the first
[2501.17s -> 2507.73s]  Excalibur rat wall. Can I get it on the way back or should I just go for it now?
[2514.00s -> 2527.38s]  Now you got everything in here. You can't get it during pizza time.
[2537.22s -> 2568.69s]  Okay. I'll go back. Am I going backwards? Yeah. Okay. Um, where is it? Is it right here?
[2586.43s -> 2630.14s]  Further back. We're here. Left there. It's a slide. All right. Get over there. Maybe the night
[2631.10s -> 2655.33s]  slide from right to left. Oh, yeah. Okay. Let's go. Wait, I didn't get this before. This is new.
[2656.05s -> 2680.27s]  Ooh, new friend. Three secrets in each level. Motoring flability in this guy. You got the secret
[2680.27s -> 2707.89s]  that's in the room. One or two from this one. Oh, okay. So now I can go here. Yeah. I genuinely did
[2707.89s -> 2713.12s]  not understand this game at all because all of, okay, when you, when you watch a game like this,
[2713.12s -> 2720.06s]  you have no idea, no context for anything. It's just, I would always catch people screaming this
[2720.06s -> 2727.90s]  and they're just sprinting and smashing. And I was like, this game, I don't know if I want to play
[2727.90s -> 2740.08s]  this, but now I understand it. That's pretty secret in that room. All right. Well, I'm not going to
[2740.08s -> 2749.71s]  get every single secret. You know what I mean? That guy's right there. I'm definitely not going
[2749.71s -> 2767.14s]  to get every secret. So I'm sorry if I missed them. I would talk. Yeah. I can't stop. Turn around,
[2767.14s -> 2808.50s]  please. Okay. I'm good. Okay. Yeah. I remember this. Cool. Oh, I slowed down. Okay. So that's
[2808.50s -> 2824.99s]  two out of three. All right. Don't mess this up at the end. I'm almost at S. Um, how do I,
[2825.71s -> 2869.14s]  where's the game progress door? There we go. Pretty much where I was. One more room, right?
[2881.52s -> 2934.21s]  Go pizza time. Go, go, go, go, go. Oh, I'm so bad at video games. I don't care. Take it off. Take it
[2934.21s -> 2985.06s]  off. I got to let go of right trigger when I get near a wall. Shit. I keep forgetting about Perry.
[2985.06s -> 3017.62s]  They haven't taught it to me yet. Oh my God. Oh my God. Guys. Hey, somebody had a pretty good tip.
[3017.62s -> 3024.91s]  Let me read it. When you're, when you're sprinting max speed, don't grab enemies. Just run through
[3024.91s -> 3034.77s]  them. Even pitchfork guys. Really come to the, what was that? What does it say? So max sprint.
[3034.77s -> 3061.84s]  I can run through stuff. All right. Let's check that out. I really like this. This is cool. Okay.
[3062.64s -> 3099.25s]  Where's this up? Where's the tutorial? How do I get out of here? Hey, come see me. I didn't,
[3099.25s -> 3108.98s]  I was looking, I was reading chat and I didn't see where it said to go. Come to Mr. Stick to rent
[3108.98s -> 3132.67s]  a boss gate. Where's that? You know, you could do a flying uppercut. I did know this next floor.
[3135.78s -> 3142.30s]  E, A, ah, I think I have to get a certain amount of points, right? Classic cook, the one and only.
[3143.10s -> 3173.44s]  Different outfits. Oh, just exploring. Okay. So there's two levels left on this zone. 100 bucks.
[3178.05s -> 3207.33s]  They go in here, you know, versus pepper, man. What the fuck? Okay.
[3215.15s -> 3272.75s]  All right. This is a small window. They're grabbing the air. Yep. Oh, what? What the fuck is
[3272.75s -> 3297.25s]  happening? What do you, what do you go? Got him. Oh shit. No, I didn't. What happened? Jesus.
[3297.89s -> 3319.23s]  Got an uppercut, uppercut, uppercut, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up,
[3319.23s -> 3364.38s]  I do it quick. No, I can't lose. My hand slipped off. I almost had a first try too. I get it. No,
[3365.02s -> 3410.51s]  let's go. Well, that's day forever. Damn it. I didn't want to hit him. I panicked too much when
[3410.51s -> 3460.53s]  I, uh, all right, let's go. This game is really fucking good. Like really good. Hey, two more,
[3460.53s -> 3485.22s]  two more. There it is. You got new clothes. Yikes. There it is. Get over here. Oh my God,
[3485.22s -> 3500.16s]  please don't do not regrow. All right. That was really fun. That was really, really fun.
[3500.16s -> 3530.83s]  You get a rating for these. Yeah, I'll take it. Uh, is S no damage? I imagine so. What do I take
[3530.83s -> 3556.10s]  this big key? There's another rank after S. Should I open this? I still have two other zones down
[3556.10s -> 3566.13s]  there. You and Vinny both got a ranking screen for their level at the exact same time. That's funny.
[3569.98s -> 3596.06s]  Yeah, I'm not, uh, this is, I'm not, I'm going back down. So this is a different place. Let's go
[3596.06s -> 3618.82s]  here. Yeah. Pink. Cool. Who the hell even made this? Games like this just kind of come out of
[3618.90s -> 3643.25s]  nowhere. Sometimes it's like, whoa, this is really cool. I get it. Definitely going up there. Ow.
[3653.36s -> 3666.40s]  It's a tower guy. It's been in development for ages. Really? Oh, I'm glad it's getting
[3666.40s -> 3680.30s]  attention because this is really cool. I didn't really know that much about it at all. Hey,
[3681.02s -> 3724.00s]  combo. Okay. So how, when does it explode? His full legal name is pizza tower guy.
[3724.96s -> 3734.86s]  Okay. I just want to see how long it was. You know, there's going to be some weird
[3734.86s -> 3771.82s]  shit with that, right? Jesus. I wonder what the speed runs of this game are going to look like.
[3772.62s -> 3819.41s]  They're probably ridiculous, right? I want to get it. Um, okay. Um, how do I do this?
[3820.29s -> 3860.26s]  What about up there? More points. I want it. Oh, nevermind. What's this guy? Oh, that's how you do
[3860.26s -> 3896.34s]  it. Okay. Shit. Come on. Come on. One secret. Start over. Start over. Reach right. Reach right.
[3896.34s -> 3916.96s]  Reach right. Did you face game in the TV corner? What? Come on. That didn't, that had to have hit
[3916.96s -> 3943.52s]  it, right? The, what the hell? What the hell? Damn. You can cancel your sprint in midair by
[3943.52s -> 3952.80s]  attacking backwards. Ooh. Don't slide to this, to a stop on the ground a lot of time. That's way,
[3952.80s -> 3980.48s]  that's incredibly helpful. Thank you. Yep. Boom. Rather than see in five minutes when I forget you
[3980.48s -> 4012.96s]  told me that and I don't ever do it ever again. My face games in the corner already. Yeah. That's
[4012.96s -> 4023.20s]  me. No, go down. I don't know why this is giving me so much trouble. It's giving me a lot of trouble
[4023.20s -> 4050.29s]  for some reason. There we go. Whoa. Okay. Uh, I gotta remember where that is. Goodness. Goodness.
[4051.01s -> 4077.65s]  Oh my goodness. I love the new hat, man. Oh, thanks. Trying to have a new style. What's the
[4079.49s -> 4106.05s]  right way? Did I miss something? Oh, my brain. I'm sorry. His brain.
[4118.61s -> 4153.34s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. I gotta, oh man. Hold on. I need to,
[4153.90s -> 4172.27s]  how do I get up there? How do I, how do I get up there? The charge jump. Yeah. It's like,
[4172.27s -> 4183.31s]  it's hard to do it from there. I don't have enough. God. Oh my goodness. I was using the
[4183.31s -> 4213.10s]  analog. I admit it. I admit it. Oh, shit. Okay. Oh, I'm not even saying anything tonight. Oh,
[4213.10s -> 4243.34s]  fuck. Come on. What? What are you doing? Here we go. All right. Let go. I'm not going in that.
[4244.06s -> 4268.72s]  Should I go in that? Isn't this guy weirdo? That is like the longest way possible. Where do I have
[4268.72s -> 4278.83s]  to go? Go down. Hurry. What am I, what do I do with this? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
[4278.83s -> 4284.45s]  What do I do? I don't understand. I don't know what to do with that. Where, where, where is it?
[4284.45s -> 4289.25s]  Other way. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what to do. Where do I throw the bomb?
[4289.81s -> 4294.70s]  The left. Why was he pointing at the bomb? Why was he pointing at the bomb?
[4297.98s -> 4309.57s]  He's not over yet. He's pointing. I always follow when he's point, point, point, point. I'm like,
[4309.57s -> 4315.57s]  oh, I got to go in the middle. He's pointing, pointing, pointing. I'm like, all right,
[4315.57s -> 4345.28s]  he's pointing right here. I have to go right here. How do I make this work? How do I decrease it or
[4345.28s -> 4388.45s]  increase it? Less dead zone. Save that up. That feels a little better. I can't watch you anymore.
[4388.45s -> 4412.08s]  All right. Bye. Thank you. How do I break this? Have a good night or wherever you're going to
[4412.08s -> 4449.60s]  sleep or something. Good night. Have a good night. I know it's getting late. You're finding
[4449.60s -> 4460.38s]  entrances to secrets and ignoring them. This game is like 500 million miles per hour. I'm going to
[4460.38s -> 4497.90s]  miss a lot of shit. Did I miss everything up here? The locked door. I'm just, I'm looking for secrets.
[4498.62s -> 4525.10s]  There you go. Okay. So meeting salmon on my cheese pizza right now. Wasn't there something I could,
[4525.10s -> 4543.60s]  I could go up with this guy, right? You know what my, my issue with this, with what the game is?
[4543.60s -> 4550.70s]  No, not my issue with the game, but my issue playing it. I always, so you, you kind of,
[4550.70s -> 4556.38s]  all right, let me, let me try to describe this. When you run, you just run up everything in my
[4556.38s -> 4560.70s]  brain. I could like jump up, you know, like, Oh, I got to jump because there's a ledge here,
[4561.34s -> 4570.40s]  but you just walk up it. I got to burn that into my brain. Don't jump up edges. Just run.
[4570.40s -> 4583.36s]  You'll make it. You only have to jump if you're trying to go up a wall like that.
[4604.67s -> 4608.99s]  This game is specifically hard to control until you get used to it at the end on the first floor.
[4608.99s -> 4616.00s]  Go get used to it. Don't worry. Oh no, I, it's, it's fucking unbelievable. I can just see why.
[4616.64s -> 4622.61s]  Like you gotta, you're going up like a ledge. If it's a hard ledge like this jump, but if it's
[4622.61s -> 4639.86s]  a slanted edge, my brain goes, go. All right. Don't go down there yet. Anything else in here?
[4640.02s -> 4709.57s]  No extra. Nope. Good night. Have a good night. I get some sleep.
[4715.22s -> 4720.18s]  I keep looking over and it's like, Hey, I keep reading. Hey, I'm going to bed. All right. See
[4720.18s -> 4725.71s]  you later. Good night. I'm getting at her. All right. Goodbye. Have I responded to a single other
[4725.71s -> 4736.70s]  comment in the last like 30 to 40 minutes? All right. Bye. I'm leaving forever. It's like,
[4736.70s -> 4748.00s]  all right, goodbye. I'm like, I'm concentrating too much on the game to be like, Oh, let me read
[4748.00s -> 4763.18s]  whatever else to everybody's saying. Is there a good way to get up there? Can you get through
[4763.18s -> 4770.56s]  there? Like that tight, you can never go up that way unless you do the super jump, right?
[4771.12s -> 4819.57s]  Great. Break that. Here we go. All right. Peanut butter. Hell yeah. Oh, I remember this part was
[4819.57s -> 4839.07s]  wicked fun. Something about those screams. They're just so, they're just so imagine being the actor
[4839.15s -> 4873.07s]  that did that. Back up there. Get that. Hold on. Wait a second. Can I? I can. Okay. Don't blow it
[4873.07s -> 4906.56s]  this time. I was going so fast too. What the heck happened? Okay. This, this part's really tricky
[4906.56s -> 4915.57s]  because you're going, you have to go so fast and stop. Yes. Yeah. Ah, slow down. So it's all right.
[4915.57s -> 4928.27s]  Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. You're not relaxing. You're not relaxing. Relax. No,
[4928.27s -> 4934.24s]  don't relax. Get into it. Hurry up. Get, stop relaxing. Stop relaxing. All right. Go, go.
[4934.24s -> 4940.72s]  Stop relaxing. Idiot. Don't relax. Stop relaxing. So I'm relaxed and I gotta, I gotta not relax.
[4971.39s -> 5025.98s]  Hey, what happened? Let's go. That was intense. Are you going to play another game? Um,
[5027.63s -> 5035.71s]  probably not. I'm really into this. This is cool. Just stop talking and make guttural noises.
[5036.51s -> 5052.50s]  I'll do that for the next level. I mean, come on. We, I gotta fix this first level, right?
[5053.38s -> 5059.07s]  There ain't, there's, there's no way I'm going to let walk out of here with a B.
[5059.95s -> 5090.46s]  Are you kidding me? Lap two. Chef task for this level is to do it in under two minutes. I don't
[5090.46s -> 5134.51s]  know if I'm going to do that. I just don't want to be. Ooh, nice. Easy. Oh, it only activates when
[5134.59s -> 5161.34s]  pizza time is on. Okay. Already had a B. 24 hit combo. Um, I feel like there's something over here.
[5162.30s -> 5203.18s]  No, start. No, I keep hitting Y. You know what else is doing? It's me too.
[5204.37s -> 5208.61s]  I almost hold Y instinctively because of any platform game, especially Mario.
[5209.57s -> 5213.81s]  Y is kind of hold it to go faster. My brain's like, yeah, you have to do that.
[5214.45s -> 5279.60s]  Probably something back here. It's going so fast. Oh shit. I didn't. Oh, sorry. Where's the door for
[5279.60s -> 5293.90s]  this guy? First time viewer. Don't you dare read this. I fucked it up. I'm sorry. I fucked it up.
[5294.62s -> 5297.98s]  Just, just go, just leave. You know what I mean? Like I'm, I've ruined, I've ruined it all for you.
[5297.98s -> 5363.47s]  Just like, sorry. Let's go. Just go. Oh my God. Doing that. How am I still a B?
[5364.86s -> 5388.19s]  B. Oh, no chance. I do this now. Maybe I got to concentrate. God damn it. It's so hard to fit
[5388.19s -> 5393.97s]  into those little fucking tiny corridors. See like, yeah, like jump it and you go the other way.
[5393.97s -> 5428.85s]  Fuck. God damn it. Oh, no. Oh, I fucking ruined it. Yeah. It's just like fitting and I might,
[5429.81s -> 5441.92s]  go, go, go, go, go, go, go. I got it. I got it. No, so hard.
[5447.47s -> 5463.25s]  Damn it. This game is really fucking hard, but it's so fun. I keep Super Mario myself too,
[5463.25s -> 5466.37s]  when it's just like, okay, here we go. And I, I'm going to run up the thing.
[5467.33s -> 5485.22s]  Sprint cancel. I know, but it's like my, it's, you got to lock it in to memory. It's just so hard to
[5485.22s -> 5512.72s]  burn it in. Do you want to tell you where secrets are? Um, if I very, very blatantly
[5512.72s -> 5517.66s]  miss one that I opened or something, then yeah, but it's okay. I don't need to get them all.
[5517.66s -> 5530.56s]  This game reminds me of something and I'm trying to figure out what it is.
[5531.60s -> 5534.88s]  And I had similar trouble with that other game too. And I don't remember what it is. It's like,
[5534.88s -> 5539.84s]  when you stick to the walls and like, when it, so for, when I jumped, those that have not played
[5539.84s -> 5547.50s]  this, I just go up the wall. Yup. I'm not pressing up or anything. It's like a completely different,
[5549.44s -> 5554.16s]  way to see what it did. See my brain said jump, because you have to jump over this
[5555.47s -> 5559.23s]  super meat point. No, I think you still have to hold the button. I think you played in your
[5569.39s -> 5580.78s]  road runner on SNES. Oh my God, dude, you got it right. How did you do that? How did you actually
[5580.78s -> 5607.22s]  do that? That's truly unbelievable. Cause I think that's correct. Wow. Yeah. Road runner on SNES.
[5607.86s -> 5616.16s]  I remember, and I remember biting my controller at certain parts of that game because like the,
[5616.80s -> 5622.83s]  say the control scheme and it was, it was, it was a similar control scheme and this control scheme is
[5622.83s -> 5644.51s]  tight. It's very, it's awesome. It's so fluid. Yeah. I had huge teeth marks on my controller,
[5644.51s -> 5659.78s]  but where's this guy's door? This guy usually has a room, right? I don't want to activate it
[5659.78s -> 5684.78s]  until I go there. Well, and I didn't, this is okay. See, it's because I'm not just,
[5684.78s -> 5698.22s]  Oh, see that I'm jumping too early. Come on, Gwen, get, get it together. See, that's what I
[5698.22s -> 5772.53s]  should be doing. Come on, Gwen, get it together. How's that not going to pass? Fuck you. Is that
[5772.53s -> 5792.21s]  it? Okay. I got a, that's all I care about. I'll never get ass. Didn't do lap two. Bye.
[5792.21s -> 5800.96s]  Why is everybody saying bye today? It's like a meme. I don't know about. All right. Bye. See
[5800.96s -> 5820.69s]  you later. So I have to do, I got one more area down here, right? You keep, you keep responding
[5820.69s -> 5856.06s]  to them. Did that already? That was so fun. Did that one up here, right? Whoa. Oh yes. That's
[5856.06s -> 5864.69s]  right. You know that your full name is Pepino spaghetti. That's unfortunate. That's like not
[5865.65s -> 5870.64s]  a full name. I feel like if your name is Pepino spaghetti,
[5874.42s -> 5877.84s]  I feel like that people will be like, wow, that's a pretty unique name.
[5879.12s -> 5904.45s]  Pepino spaghetti. All right. I'm ready. I'm not going to mess it up. Back up some weird shit in
[5904.45s -> 5930.00s]  here. Right? Why is this like this? I keep forgetting. Don't do that. Forgetting. There's that
[5930.00s -> 5965.90s]  and go that way. Right? Does anybody know what that scream is called? Does anybody know what that is?
[5965.90s -> 5984.69s]  That's got a very specific name, doesn't it? All right. Well, I got it. Really?
[5988.45s -> 6013.07s]  Tom, it's Mel Blanc. It's Mel Blanc. Really? That's Mel Blanc. What is it? What do you call it?
[6017.62s -> 6045.14s]  Mel Blanc scream or Tom and Jerry? Is that, I don't think that's Wilhelm. Yeah, that's not
[6045.14s -> 6101.86s]  Wilhelm. Damn it. This is going to be so hard to do this on the way back. I can get in there.
[6101.94s -> 6136.69s]  How do I get in there? You're going to get probably from down. Okay. I go like this.
[6136.69s -> 6169.54s]  Huh? What? I'm under. Uh, yeah, you're right. You're right. Thank you. Okay.
[6192.34s -> 6208.50s]  Did I get everything? I think so. You guys doing a race? What are you guys doing? Why wasn't I
[6208.50s -> 6279.55s]  invited? Jesus. I don't have that guy. Harry button. I haven't pressed at all. And I missed it.
[6280.27s -> 6420.99s]  All right. Down. Oh, come on. Peppino. Oh, come on. Peppino. Did my microphone go like, oh yeah.
[6424.35s -> 6448.99s]  No, Pino. That was a lot cleaner on back. All right. Got a hundred bucks. I can do area two now,
[6448.99s -> 6458.00s]  right? I mean, my brain does this thing where like my brain, like it does this sort of thing.
[6458.96s -> 6489.06s]  I was, I was poking fun at myself. Okay. So we got this place. What's going on with these two?
[6489.94s -> 6506.18s]  Know that you can walk and parry. Yeah. Ooh, this one looks fun. All right. I'm doing this one.
[6506.18s -> 6510.90s]  It's like a banyan. How am I doing? I'm doing pretty good. Thanks for asking. Hope you're doing
[6510.90s -> 6549.78s]  good too. I love the way this level looks. Good stream. Bye. He keeps reading them. All right. Bye.
[6560.32s -> 6578.80s]  Learn to parry at the very beginning. Hollywood edge sound effects library from the cartoon
[6578.80s -> 6583.52s]  tracks volume two. The track name is called funny man yells in medium high pitched tone.
[6584.32s -> 6610.75s]  Okay. Good to know. Can I go through that way? It's not the Pino's though. It's close,
[6610.75s -> 6626.61s]  but it's not right. Really? Hold on. I want to look this up. I'll do it edge.
[6629.25s -> 6658.67s]  Dream. I just type it. What's it called? Funny man yells. Is this it? I'm going to turn it down.
[6658.67s -> 6686.35s]  It gets really loud. Dude, this is orphan of costs. This is orphan of costs. What the fuck?
[6688.03s -> 6714.05s]  No, it's not. That's absolutely orphan of costs. There's no way it's not. Especially this first
[6714.05s -> 6780.18s]  one. That's unbelievable. Orphan costs yell. It's definitely it. I can't. All right. I'm going
[6780.18s -> 6795.31s]  back to play this game. The coolest thing about finding, thinking, hearing stuff like that,
[6795.31s -> 6802.82s]  you wouldn't believe how much, how many video game sounds are just everywhere shared just from
[6802.82s -> 6810.62s]  different libraries. Wait, orphan isolated screams. I mean, we're here. We're doing this right now,
[6810.62s -> 6826.64s]  just for another minute. Yeah, that's, there's no, it's just filters on it. There's a filter on it
[6826.64s -> 6840.27s]  and that's it. I love that. That's so funny. Do that impression. I would blow up my vocal chords.
[6840.27s -> 6863.95s]  Yeah, there's a little bit of reverb on it. Okay, let's go. Now add farting to it. No, dude. Come
[6863.95s -> 6881.71s]  on. It's one of those moments where, okay, you know, the TF2 door opening sound effect and you
[6881.71s -> 6886.67s]  hear it in another game or in a TV show or something and you just, you brain goes,
[6886.67s -> 6892.58s]  whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. Somebody's open the spawn door. It was one of those moments.
[6901.70s -> 6932.78s]  You're good. I can't even play the game anymore. Now it's over. I can't even play. I can't do that.
[6932.78s -> 6955.49s]  Oh, get out of the way. Double jump. Oh, oh, wait, wait, no, this is, this is a good thing. Okay.
[6962.59s -> 7007.33s]  Oh shit. Okay. Hold on. All right. I don't want to take it off yet. Look, there's a place over
[7007.33s -> 7046.24s]  there. Oh, there's a place over there. Oh, that hurts. I'm going to get destroyed on the run back
[7046.24s -> 7065.47s]  part. I haven't strung much together in this one. Hey, I'm staying. Hello. You can stay or leave.
[7065.47s -> 7072.88s]  It's up to you. If you want to go, I'll see you later. Or maybe not. If you want to go and
[7074.50s -> 7081.07s]  get dinner or food or snack or sleep, it's up to you. Not tell you what to do with your time.
[7084.16s -> 7096.61s]  I can rage at what just happened. And hey, time is a precious thing.
[7097.65s -> 7111.62s]  So make sure you use it the way you want to. Time is a precious resource.
[7124.06s -> 7154.85s]  Who is hitting me? I'm, I've hit, you know, more than 10 times now in like 10 hundred times, dude.
[7154.85s -> 7173.82s]  Can you, I didn't know if there's something over there I could do. There's so many secrets in this
[7173.82s -> 7209.57s]  game. I'm trying to find them. Are you kidding me? All right. Let's bring something together.
[7209.57s -> 7259.47s]  This is hard to do. Shaking my head. Hurry up. Oh, no. Get it together. I'll be all right.
[7299.78s -> 7321.92s]  All right. Don't don't don't don't. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. This stuff I can do here, right?
[7321.92s -> 7333.79s]  No, no. Okay. We're good. No, I don't have the janitor. Sorry. Right. Oh, second lap.
[7334.99s -> 7346.29s]  That was kind of, that was a little crap. It's okay though. I'm just topping too. That's kind of
[7346.29s -> 7393.01s]  crap. That's terrifying. Holy shit. Oh, I can buy it. Oh, interesting. Is one of these a bar
[7404.67s -> 7410.03s]  saloon? Oh, this one's gonna be cool. Make a weird noise. Yeah, sure. Of course I will.
[7413.47s -> 7417.39s]  I'm the weird noise guy. That's what I do here. Tell your friends.
[7420.38s -> 7433.17s]  I got to parry this. I missed it. You can do it backwards. All right. Cool.
[7443.46s -> 7461.95s]  Don't go. What are you doing? What's this thing? Lap two room. Oh, okay. Cool.
[7462.67s -> 7515.58s]  Hmm. I thought I went all over the water. Apparently not. Cool. Just got back to the bathroom.
[7515.58s -> 7523.97s]  I did. I missed any funny or weird noises or anything. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm under my contract.
[7525.01s -> 7556.14s]  I can only do two an hour. So I can't go like, dude. What is the, what do I do about this? Oh,
[7568.11s -> 7571.87s]  you lost the race. I didn't know there was a race even going on.
[7572.51s -> 7640.88s]  My softlock. Get up there. There we go. I don't understand what's going on here. Um,
[7640.88s -> 7652.70s]  it is a little confusing. It's very fast. It's very high, uh, off pain. Is that correct? High
[7652.70s -> 7690.37s]  skill. High fast. Very quick. Very speed runnable. Is this a secret right here? I bet I could beat
[7690.37s -> 7715.95s]  you in a hair growing competition. Um, you have long hair because you've already won pizza. Oh,
[7717.31s -> 7793.60s]  I won. Yikes. No, stop jumping. No, no. I gotta get all the cards, right? Come on.
[7793.60s -> 7837.14s]  Can't just not get them. Oh shit. Oh, I got it. All right. That's pretty clean. Pretty clean.
[7837.70s -> 7875.50s]  I don't have any complaints. Okay. I didn't screw this all up. Did I?
[7895.23s -> 7899.04s]  Hmm. I want that. There you go.
[7908.62s -> 7929.81s]  Is music too low? Um, I can turn it. I probably turn it down a little.
[7930.69s -> 7951.79s]  That's far better. How's that on the wall? On the wall. Secret in the last room. You mean
[7951.79s -> 7987.36s]  we're on the wall, right side or left side? There's like three rooms back. Um, but right here,
[7987.36s -> 8024.61s]  right there. As I can get it. Hey, yes, I can. Oh man. I got it. All right. Now I don't want to,
[8024.61s -> 8031.79s]  I gotta, I don't blow on it this time. You know what I mean? Don't blow it. I got a,
[8031.79s -> 8045.81s]  this is going pretty well. Don't blow it. Oh, I don't even need to do this anymore.
[8046.45s -> 8152.34s]  Is that an emote? Hmm. What happened to me? I got, I got a chef. No lap two. I'm not confident
[8152.42s -> 8172.77s]  enough to do lap two. On a second run through maybe. I missed one. Oh, you have to beat it
[8172.77s -> 8187.30s]  one time anyways. Okay. That's good to know. Do you use money for anything else or is it just
[8187.30s -> 8213.71s]  the portals? This is a boss. Let's see it. Vigilante. Is this guy made out of butter?
[8217.33s -> 8271.97s]  Gun. I can probably parry those, right? What is going on? Oh, it's hitting. Okay. It's splash
[8271.97s -> 8314.13s]  damage. Oh goodness. Fuck. You cannot parry them. Okay. I was under the impression that I could.
[8320.90s -> 8372.75s]  You can. Why didn't it work? Really? It looked like I did a parry it. Yeah. Okay. Um, what? Well,
[8372.75s -> 8379.82s]  I had to know. I didn't know it was going to be like countdown or something. I didn't think it was,
[8379.82s -> 8390.72s]  I didn't want to fault. I thought I was, I didn't, I guess it's a draw, but I thought it was whatever.
[8390.72s -> 8473.38s]  I'm going to do a better job anyways. Restart it. Stupid. All right. We're good. What is that?
[8473.94s -> 8480.43s]  Hold on. Why can I reload it? It's weird. Let's just do. Oh, it's like a super shot. All right.
[8481.15s -> 8544.54s]  Shit. All right. Don't get too fancy with it. No reason to even do that. I jumped over it.
[8544.54s -> 8575.55s]  You dumb mother fucker. I'm fine. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[8583.42s -> 8690.21s]  That one doesn't count. We're going to do it a different way. I know it's just itchy. Shut up.
[8690.21s -> 8702.75s]  I forgot he could even do that stupid ass move. What? Um, it's awful. I'm going to restart. I
[8702.75s -> 8815.95s]  don't care. Change this immediately. Immediately. I can't believe he does it like five fucking six
[8815.95s -> 8884.51s]  fucking five fucking six fucking times. What's happening? What's going on? I think that was
[8884.51s -> 8918.53s]  better. You have to jump those ones. God damn it. It's no, it's going to be a last try. I'm addicted.
[8918.53s -> 8930.22s]  I'm sorry. I just am. How many hits is a so I can know it's going to make me laugh at every time,
[8930.22s -> 8997.74s]  dude. Everything spawned at the same time. That was unfortunate. You just went over your contracted
[8997.74s -> 9029.15s]  limit of funny noises. Let me read chat and get hurt. Get this shit off. I wouldn't. What a character
[9029.15s -> 9056.82s]  am I? Oh my God. It's over, dude. Oh, you, there's no way you didn't die. I shot you a hundred fucking
[9056.82s -> 9112.40s]  times again. I need to get hit one less time. So was it two, three? I got screwed there. I got,
[9112.40s -> 9217.58s]  I took, I took a hit there that I should never have taken. Oh my God. I was, I didn't have it.
[9217.58s -> 9256.22s]  Quiet. I think I lost it again. Dude, when he drops a cow, a cardboard person, that it's just,
[9256.22s -> 9267.02s]  it's just, you're going to get hit. I think I got it though. Didn't I? That's definitely a right.
[9267.02s -> 9295.65s]  Two hits, three hits. That's gotta be a, is S no damage? That's so hard. That's probably so hard
[9295.65s -> 9300.21s]  to do. Let me just, for all you gamers out there, people that are watching wherever you are,
[9303.36s -> 9315.95s]  if you're able to just kind of grab this and do it and beat it in, get S on every level and shit,
[9317.63s -> 9324.59s]  man, you are, you're just, you're, you're good. You're just, you're eyesight,
[9325.82s -> 9336.26s]  your coordination, your, your eyesight in floor three. Oh, we're not done with floor two.
[9341.60s -> 9353.01s]  Like your visual, hold on. I'm going to go ahead and talk about something that I've been telling
[9353.01s -> 9359.22s]  others who know about this place of worship that you did this. Well, we're down from your pizzeria
[9359.22s -> 9364.10s]  and we're down from this tower. There are customers and they want to see one of these things.
[9364.10s -> 9369.54s]  So I got a friend. He went down one of these floors and this guy came up next to me.
[9369.54s -> 9372.98s]  The idea was, why is that when you're in the upper part of the tower?
[9373.70s -> 9378.50s]  There's the pizza face character and then there's this man from your previous life leading the way.
[9378.50s -> 9384.82s]  There's a pizza in your tower with all this information. What is this even trying to say?
[9386.58s -> 9412.70s]  Talk about these things? What does that even mean? B, eh, it's all right. S rank is one to
[9412.70s -> 9474.85s]  two hits. P rank is no hits. It sounds like the clay fighter theme song. Pizza Mark. Why am I so
[9474.85s -> 9495.63s]  bad at this game? Bro, I have a rank in almost every level. What are you on about? A means
[9495.63s -> 9501.44s]  excellent. No, I'm not going to get P in every level. I'm not going to get S in every single level.
[9502.16s -> 9538.70s]  How do you ground pound with it being turned off and down? You don't? Oh, you have to bind it.
[9539.26s -> 9553.95s]  So it's not like a button combination. I have to have it on. I thought it would be like down and
[9553.95s -> 9587.57s]  X or something. Oh, wait, is it? No. OK. Oh, wait. I had to run and dive. Yeah. Sorry.
[9588.29s -> 9605.47s]  Didn't realize that was going to happen. Can I reset it now? Oh, you can bind to buttons. OK,
[9605.47s -> 9615.52s]  that's better. Yeah, that's way easier for me. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, should it be
[9616.32s -> 9629.89s]  a circle left trigger? Maybe. All right. So that's left trigger. That's circle.
[9636.43s -> 9650.42s]  I'm going to flip those because that's weird to do that jump and left trigger is better.
[9659.62s -> 9675.68s]  All right. Just getting used to it. I have to relearn everything. I have to put it back.
[9675.68s -> 9688.13s]  I have to put it back. It's fucking with me. It's been too. You know what? The big mistake
[9688.13s -> 9698.30s]  was I spent way too long with it. Not on. That was a change. I should have. I was supposed to
[9698.30s -> 9742.83s]  make two and a half hours ago. You only tried it for 10 seconds. Yeah, but I'm in like, I mean,
[9742.83s -> 9748.59s]  I'm pretty far into this first part of the game. I feel like this would be a bad place to do it.
[9748.59s -> 9797.76s]  I should do it on one of the earlier levels. Do I need to go? I have to be breathing fire,
[9797.76s -> 9832.48s]  don't I? Wait, hold on. Why does it keep spawning these? Where did I get the fire? Oh, OK. Well,
[9832.48s -> 9872.61s]  what the fuck? I did not know I was supposed to do that. Ten hit combo. Why did it stop?
[9873.17s -> 9953.49s]  I should get these down here. Thank you. No, damn it. Didn't mean to press that.
[9953.49s -> 9993.89s]  I let me try to go back over here and whatever aliens. Oh, my goodness. I feel like I'm
[9993.89s -> 10010.90s]  a human pinball in this game. You just kind of like bounce over everything. Here comes an alien
[10010.90s -> 10018.99s]  rant. And by the way, when aliens actually finally fucking land, they're going to take a bite of
[10018.99s -> 10039.47s]  pizza. Kidding. All right. I'm going to get my ass kicked on this level. Goodness, I don't know.
[10039.47s -> 10085.70s]  Which way? God, am I even going the right direction? I have no idea. I didn't want to go in here.
[10085.70s -> 10113.89s]  Not that way. You know, also with this game, too, I think, oh, you when you memorize the level,
[10114.45s -> 10120.21s]  which is good luck, I ain't ever going to do that. That's into the crazy routes. This is going to be
[10120.21s -> 10141.70s]  C rank, but whatever. Oh, OK. The speed runs for this game are nuts. I'd love to watch them,
[10142.26s -> 10150.78s]  but I'd like to beat it first. That's going to make me feel bad if I watch a speed run,
[10151.50s -> 10169.52s]  because like while I go like this, oh, that person already beat three levels. So what's left?
[10170.08s -> 10196.64s]  Did I do all the third second level? Is there one more? Howdy, welcome to floor two.
[10197.36s -> 10219.46s]  Thirty one out of ninety five, eight out of fifty seven, two out of nineteen waste yard.
[10219.46s -> 10252.74s]  All right, let's make this one clean, please. It's going to be this is going to be clean.
[10252.74s -> 10311.63s]  What the fuck? My God. Whoa. Move through. OK, that's cool. That's the best way to get in there
[10311.63s -> 10352.64s]  like that. All right, let's get this right. What does this do? Just go fast. OK. Oh, it's a timer.
[10352.64s -> 10379.58s]  I get it. I hope that was all right. What are you doing over there? Where did you come from?
[10392.08s -> 10432.69s]  Hurry. Oh, better. Those ghost pepper. Oh, what is the new hottest pepper in the world?
[10434.32s -> 10438.48s]  They keep changing it, right? They keep going into science experiments and oh, this is the
[10438.48s -> 10445.76s]  Scorpion Ultra HD, like 4K, 1080p pepper. What is it now? They change it every few years.
[10446.64s -> 10463.42s]  Carolina Reaper is still the number one. Why? Why?
[10481.55s -> 10509.50s]  Here. Get in there. This guy's fucking terrifying. Get away from me. Come on, man.
[10533.50s -> 10576.83s]  Oh, fuck. I thought it was a way to go down, but it's not. Holy shit. This game is crap.
[10576.83s -> 10616.42s]  Oh, hi. Awesome. Something called Pepper X. Pepper that is most recognized as the
[10616.42s -> 10626.18s]  spiciest pepper in the world is known as Pepper X. Pepper X was created by none other than Ed
[10626.18s -> 10633.34s]  Curry, the creator of the Carolina Reaper. He created Pepper X by cross breeding various
[10633.34s -> 10638.85s]  chili pepper types to create a heat that is hotter than the Carolina Reaper. But if this is true,
[10638.85s -> 10644.59s]  why is the Carolina Reaper more famous than Pepper X? That's because Pepper X is yet to be
[10644.59s -> 10649.89s]  confirmed as the world's hottest pepper by the Guinness Book of World Records. Of the time being,
[10649.89s -> 10671.04s]  Carolina Reaper, yeah, whatever. Pepper X. Oh, I got to tweet out my sponsor tweet for Wild Hearts.
[10671.04s -> 10690.48s]  This floor is done? Yeah. Is there anything? Do I want? Yeah, B is okay for me. I'm not really
[10690.48s -> 10698.27s]  a gamer. It's okay. It's been a little bit. No, it was supposed to be within like
[10699.84s -> 10709.63s]  two days of doing the stream. So it's okay. Vacation Resort. Oh, they're happy now. They're
[10709.63s -> 10727.04s]  friends. Holly and I have been playing Wild Hearts and I recorded something that I would like to show
[10727.04s -> 10732.37s]  at some point tonight. And I don't even know if it's that funny, but I feel like it was.
[10735.04s -> 10740.51s]  It was the hardest. I've laughed in like two or three weeks at some point. How about right now?
[10741.07s -> 10746.72s]  I'm going to do it right now. Show it now. I have, I like, I prepared it because I was like,
[10746.72s -> 10756.10s]  I probably want to show this. I'll do it in a little bit after this mini golf.
[10762.90s -> 10833.58s]  I got it. Nothing. What? These count as hits? No. What? Hey, I got it. Nice. Okay. Cool.
[10833.58s -> 10878.11s]  This level is awesome. I like this. Fuck you. Can I aim it differently or can I only just aim
[10878.11s -> 10911.47s]  it up or straight? Stop. All right. That's, I don't get that, but it's hard, but whatever.
[10911.47s -> 10959.39s]  All right. Two more shots. Shit in my pants. Got it. Go get sucked into it. 15. R15. That's
[10959.39s -> 10979.70s]  kind of high. Stop. No, this is actually kind of sucks. What's the speed run on this look like?
[10979.70s -> 11001.63s]  I wonder. Can I not get hit by this? That would be fantastic. It wasn't as bad as I thought.
[11014.78s -> 11029.36s]  You just run into the ball at top speed. Interesting. How do I go backwards with this?
[11030.00s -> 11045.23s]  I wonder if I can. No. I'm kind of scared to do this. I'm going to run into the ball. I'm
[11045.23s -> 11093.07s]  just going to do like three hits on it. Stop. I get plenty of time. Suck them up. Yes. Present.
[11094.93s -> 11135.54s]  That was nice. Soda course. You know, he made it. Don't bounce back here, please. Thank you.
[11136.34s -> 11193.47s]  Appreciate it. Nice toss. Remember Boogerman? I do remember Boogerman. I've been playing it once
[11193.47s -> 11196.91s]  and I think I got lost on the first level I think when I was younger and just quit.
[11197.55s -> 11252.80s]  I never played it ever again. Backwards. How do I open that? Let's go. 15. All right. Just walk
[11252.80s -> 11259.89s]  over there. You'll be good. I think my microwave keeps going off. Yeah, that is kind of a microwave
[11259.89s -> 11288.10s]  sound, isn't it? Wait. Oh, hold on. These things are freaking me out. Let me get the right angle
[11288.10s -> 11337.41s]  here. What the hell even is this level? I didn't even know that. I didn't know that was a ladder.
[11337.41s -> 11370.45s]  All right. Get over there. All right. Stop throwing me. And I know you fucking little shit.
[11370.45s -> 11417.52s]  Get over here. 15. Shit. 14. Oh no. He's going all the way back. Thank God. Thank goodness.
[11417.52s -> 11448.62s]  Final course. It's pizza time already. It's pizza time already. It is. Uh oh. Where's the,
[11450.18s -> 11481.06s]  um, what's, where do I go? Down? Present. I want it. I don't actually have to get this. Do I?
[11483.20s -> 11522.54s]  No way, dude. I have to actually get this in. Okay. Oh, get us in there.
[11531.38s -> 11572.93s]  Okay. No, no, no. Slow down. Slow down. Slow down. Slow down. Stop. Nope. I don't have the key.
[11573.49s -> 11631.12s]  Let's go. Let's go. That one was very, very strange. It was fun though. I got all the
[11631.12s -> 11640.77s]  toppings. Good. All right. I need to, yeah, let's do two things here. Let me just,
[11640.77s -> 11647.52s]  I need to tweak my sponsor thing. You want to watch this video? All right. Let me give you the
[11647.52s -> 11653.01s]  context of this video. Is that, is actually, I don't know. I don't think it's a scripted event.
[11653.01s -> 11659.42s]  I think it just kind of happened, but he was just doing it for me for some reason.
[11660.06s -> 11664.32s]  I thought it was the funniest thing ever. All right. Let's watch it. It's like a,
[11664.32s -> 11679.31s]  it's 10, 15 seconds long. So in the game, just like in obviously like monster hunter and stuff,
[11679.31s -> 11690.69s]  the monsters sometimes will be annoyed with each other. And these two monsters like got kind of
[11690.69s -> 11699.20s]  in each other's face and they, something very funny happened. I don't know if it happens all
[11699.20s -> 11706.61s]  the time, but I'm going to play it. So here you go. So this is me and Holly are playing.
[11706.61s -> 11712.91s]  I've been, we've been playing this game off stream. I've been playing it. I think it's fun.
[11712.91s -> 11715.07s]  I want to watch it a couple of times, but I want to break it down a little bit
[11715.07s -> 11721.47s]  because I think it's funny. So this is a lava gorilla on the right here.
[11722.43s -> 11729.70s]  That's the quest was to find the lava back. Okay. Found it. But do you remember that little dolphin
[11729.70s -> 11738.38s]  that zoomed in? Cause I want you to be able to see it better. So that little dolphin squirrel from
[11741.01s -> 11748.46s]  when me and Vinny were playing it, if this is scripted, it's hilarious. I'm playing,
[11748.46s -> 11751.92s]  I'm playing on a series S by the way, if you're wondering where it looks bad,
[11751.92s -> 11759.57s]  it doesn't look bad. It just zoomed in and it's on a series S and I'm recording.
[11759.57s -> 11767.01s]  I like pulled it from the Xbox, which I think records at who fucking knows probably like
[11767.01s -> 11774.10s]  not even 720 P, but all you need to see is this. So these two monsters, they get, here we come.
[11777.42s -> 11783.79s]  They're annoyed with each other. He's like, I'm going to spray and then they just kind of sit here
[11783.79s -> 11789.36s]  and it's like, okay, what's going to happen here? I guess it gets really, maybe they're going to fight
[11789.36s -> 11809.57s]  and then watch what happens. He fucking destroys him. He embarrasses him so much to a point where
[11809.57s -> 11823.18s]  he just gets up and leaves. He's like, I'm out of here. The funniest part of this whole clip is
[11823.18s -> 11830.78s]  the fact that, so you, you go up, you're yelling at each other's faces, right? You get up on that
[11830.78s -> 11840.70s]  little podium, you're ready for a fight and then he looks behind him. He's like, why is he looking
[11840.70s -> 11856.27s]  behind him? And then finally he realizes right here. Oh shit. He does this like, oh, it's just
[11856.27s -> 11870.48s]  perfect. Why would you turn your back? And then he just grabs him by the tail, he throws him.
[11871.55s -> 11888.34s]  It was so sad. Look up this turf war video. I just thought it was really funny. I just wanted to
[11888.34s -> 11893.84s]  show it. I don't think it's scripted. I think that the monsters can literally just like Monster Hunter
[11893.84s -> 11902.35s]  can walk into each other and attack each other. It's at the level of this. Oh, that's so funny then.
[11908.24s -> 11911.20s]  Is it scripted? Well, if it's scripted, it's fucking funny because
[11915.78s -> 11930.38s]  he just gets decimated. It's technically scripted. Yeah, but it's still funny. I like it. That's my
[11930.38s -> 11950.53s]  video. You're easily amused. I think that's a good thing. How long had the fight been going before
[11950.53s -> 11960.59s]  that? They just, there was nothing. They just walked into each other and then he ran away.
[11960.59s -> 11966.86s]  We were looking for that monster and they have these paths and that one just happened to be
[11966.86s -> 11975.09s]  there. That was the only thing that happened. They found each other and then they ran away.
[11975.09s -> 11982.19s]  Okay. I'm going to do one more of it. I said video, one more level and I'm probably going to
[11982.19s -> 12001.30s]  call it. I'm kind of hungry. That poor little squirrel. Do the forest level. Is it in here?
[12001.30s -> 12035.38s]  I walked into here accidentally. 200. How many floors are there? Five? Cool. All right. Let's
[12035.38s -> 12089.52s]  do it. Ooh. Can I make it through that? I wonder, is this going to help me later?
[12089.52s -> 12148.16s]  Is there anything else I can do? Oh, I had it. Shit. Read out the pig video. Uh, yep. Hello.
[12148.16s -> 12173.87s]  Thank you for the reminder. Gustavo and brick tutorial. I guess we got to do this move faster
[12173.87s -> 12193.36s]  and destroy metal blocks. Yeah. Kick the rat. Whoa. The air to do a double jump and cancel out of the
[12194.48s -> 12231.28s]  cancel out of it with another move. This is fun. This is cute. Is there anything else that I should
[12231.28s -> 12255.71s]  do? Or is that it? I like the kick. I'm trying to read. Leave me alone. Double jump can also
[12255.71s -> 12265.73s]  destroy metal blocks underneath while doing the double jump hold while holding in the direction
[12265.73s -> 12305.31s]  of a wall. Let's go. That's cool. I like that. So these face blocks, I imagine you probably unlock
[12305.31s -> 12309.55s]  it later. And it's like a Metroid, uh, you know, mania thing where you kept to come back and do
[12309.55s -> 12323.04s]  it all again, right? No. Oh, wait, it's no, right. They disappear for some reason. I thought maybe
[12323.04s -> 12345.79s]  eventually you could open it all. That's right. That's right. Yep. Goodness. That was cool.
[12346.51s -> 12414.94s]  Checking for secret. This guy's problem. The delivery. Oh, shit. I got it. Give me those
[12415.90s -> 12508.64s]  more toppings. Um, that bounce, right? Hurry. No, come here. You can do it. Smoking.
[12508.64s -> 12553.70s]  I said, am I too high to watch this? Um, be careful, man. All right. I feel like I'm getting
[12553.70s -> 12592.22s]  close. Right. Right. That the soundtrack might be my favorite part of the whole game. It's just so,
[12592.22s -> 12614.64s]  it's very pleasant. I don't know where the door was for this guy. I'm not sure I even saw it yet.
[12614.64s -> 12657.82s]  Oh, come on. My delivery. Got to get it. Hurry. No. No. Oh my goodness. Oh, come on. Just go.
[12659.98s -> 12710.46s]  Thank goodness. Let's just go. Final delivery too. And does anybody do like a hundred percent
[12710.46s -> 12714.62s]  get a hundred percent of the clocks like that would be unbelievably difficult.
[12715.58s -> 12760.67s]  Just that's, that's so much stress. Stop bouncing around. Back to that guy. Oh,
[12762.83s -> 12797.09s]  just go. I got an A already. Just go sneak down there. What are you doing, man? Nice. Sorry. I'm
[12797.09s -> 12804.13s]  not really talking. My brain needs like 1000% power to play this. It's really fun though. I
[12804.13s -> 12811.58s]  really like it. Oh, but I have to see what the boss is. We're not done. I need to tweet out that
[12811.58s -> 12833.90s]  thing. All right. Okay. Two attempts at the boss and that's it. Two attempts at the boss and I'm
[12833.90s -> 12858.82s]  done. You're streaming a stream. You're going to tweet sponsored content at 10 p.m. Pacific.
[12858.82s -> 12883.57s]  Uh-oh. Rival Pizzeria. Okay. I'm just, I'm playing like an idiot here. Oh, it's supposed to be the
[12884.29s -> 12905.60s]  pizza hut. All right. What was that thing's name? The Noid. Yeah. Don't do that. Did I pick them up?
[12905.60s -> 12912.27s]  Okay. You can't pick up the bombs. Just restart. Why not? That doesn't count as an attempt to have
[12912.27s -> 13001.81s]  to die. Ow. All right. Base two. Jeez. What's the opportunity? Right there. Jesus. Oh, I thought
[13001.81s -> 13041.86s]  that was a little guy. Damn it. Oh, come on, man. All right. One more. One more. That was it. I had
[13041.86s -> 13133.23s]  it. He throws the skateboard out. Do your thing. Dick. Dick. Oh, you dick. Okay. Oh, I thought he
[13133.23s -> 13205.68s]  was going to go up. Oh, that bait. So annoying. Stop. Fine. I can do that too. I'm going to get an
[13205.68s -> 13251.62s]  F. Whatever. I'm going to pass it. It's probably a C. Is the lowest grade a C? He is lower. Okay.
[13251.62s -> 13265.55s]  That's a good place to stop, I think. Saves automatically, I imagine, right? Well, I'm
[13265.55s -> 13271.47s]  definitely going to finish this game. You will see it again. 100%. This game is really fun.
[13272.27s -> 13277.74s]  We're not really talking that much, especially the last like hour or two. I was gaming hard,
[13277.74s -> 13288.19s]  but it's really fun. I really like it. All right. So the next time I will be live,
[13288.19s -> 13302.74s]  probably one more time this week, maybe on Friday, but after Friday, there's a lot. There's a lot of
[13302.74s -> 13311.98s]  work to finish up for grotto piece and then come this next week and have a lot of stuff to share.
[13313.07s -> 13322.00s]  All very exciting. I'm really, really excited for it. Hopefully it's, uh, hopefully it's been
[13322.00s -> 13332.42s]  worth the wait. I think it has. It looks fucking unbelievable. It looks so fucking cool. I'm really,
[13332.42s -> 13352.35s]  really happy with it. And frog detective too. You don't want to miss frog detective. I don't
[13352.35s -> 13356.99s]  want to over hype it because obviously that's always not a good thing to do. That's why I don't
[13356.99s -> 13363.33s]  talk that much about like events that much sometimes before they happen with maybe one or
[13363.33s -> 13371.02s]  two exceptions, but there's a lot of information to share. Keep an eye on the grotto beast Twitter
[13371.66s -> 13379.73s]  and then obviously on here too. I'll be talking a lot about it next week. Oh, I need to tweet this
[13379.73s -> 13389.18s]  out. All right. I'm tweeting up my sponsor thing. This is the pig video. Thanks for hanging out
[13389.18s -> 13396.56s]  those. Thanks for sticking around. Um, that game's awesome. I feel like civilization Sim thing was
[13396.56s -> 13425.78s]  fun too, but pizza tower is very, very good. Now, if you don't mind me, I've got a tweet about a pig.
[13425.78s -> 13431.92s]  I'll see you guys on Friday. We're going to finish up pizza tower and I imagine probably something
[13431.92s -> 13437.58s]  else. Cause I imagine there's probably not more than another two or three hours. We'll see. Uh,
[13437.58s -> 13440.62s]  would raid. Is Vinny playing right now? Vinny's probably playing this right now. Let's raid Vinny.
[13441.34s -> 13460.11s]  Why not? Thank you again. I was extra sleepy today. I'm gonna wake up. Well, I didn't get very much
[13460.11s -> 13468.22s]  sleep last night. I think I slept four hours, which is not very much. I don't recommend it.
[13468.22s -> 13477.01s]  Um, but I was ready to game late night last night. I wonder why.
[13481.17s -> 13491.89s]  All right guys, take care of yourselves. Take it easy. All right, hold on. I got to tweet this.
[13498.21s -> 13508.77s]  10 30 PM. The perfect time for a sponsor tweet. Let's see. Does it look good? All right,
[13508.77s -> 13533.22s]  it's going out and there it goes. Let's see if it, let's see if it hits your feed. Did it hit your
[13533.22s -> 13568.90s]  feed? Did it hit feeds? Not yet. What's taking it so long? Hey, there it goes. I said, I don't have
[13568.90s -> 13588.85s]  Twitter. Yeah. I mean, I only use it every so often. Very cool. Thanks a lot guys. I'll see you Friday.
[13588.85s -> 13599.02s]  Have a good night. Get some sleep. You forgot hashtag ad in the tweet. Uh, no, it says sponsored
[13599.02s -> 13630.67s]  by EA. That's fine. I think that's okay, right? No, that's good. It says sponsored by EA in it.
[13630.67s -> 13649.01s]  Yeah. Good night. See you soon. Oh shit. Yeah. That's raving. Go say hello to Vinny Vinesauce.
[13649.01s -> 13654.02s]  Take care of yourselves. Good night.
