[0.31s -> 18.31s]  What is, what kind of intro is this? It sounds like a bunch of birds. Oh, it's like people playing like they're like
[18.75s -> 26.94s]  Why is it like a giant YouTube button in the middle like, oh play the video. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to
[27.78s -> 32.59s]  Football lol. That's not even what it's called. It's called football. This game is a game
[32.59s -> 36.67s]  Where you play football or soccer if you're an American. This is the part where you make duck noises.
[36.67s -> 39.43s]  I know this is this is the part where you make duck noises
[39.43s -> 42.51s]  So you don't even have to do it now because you already said that's the part where you make duck noises
[42.51s -> 44.57s]  And it's already been done, right? So this game
[48.19s -> 51.07s]  So if you take a look here
[51.19s -> 53.19s]  this is the
[53.67s -> 57.91s]  Power-ups that you can do during this game and you're wondering what do you mean a power-up?
[57.99s -> 62.91s]  Well, each one of these things see this mine right here. I can we don't control any characters
[63.31s -> 70.05s]  Nobody controls any of the actual players you just control the weird power-ups and the stupid AI tries to score goals on each other
[71.26s -> 73.26s]  Okay, good luck. Good luck
[76.05s -> 80.40s]  You're just gonna get fans
[80.92s -> 82.92s]  Good game. What?
[84.96s -> 93.06s]  Win by five. I win. What did you do? I won. I was like spamming you guys with like ants
[93.58s -> 97.99s]  Okay, I have the star. Yes, screw you
[99.71s -> 103.48s]  You're not doing this. I'll do whatever it takes
[106.08s -> 108.08s]  You can't do it now
[108.20s -> 109.77s]  Oh
[109.77s -> 112.67s]  Get off the field everybody get the field spam cows
[113.77s -> 117.22s]  What's the score?
[118.10s -> 120.10s]  Where's my it's down here?
[120.22s -> 122.24s]  alright, where I
[122.24s -> 124.32s]  Can't believe one just went in right there. I
[125.32s -> 131.28s]  Did I win? No. No, you didn't what it's nine to seven. What's but we need to just win by five, right?
[131.28s -> 136.28s]  Yes, you need to win by five. I'm like running out of resources. Yeah, I need to build resources
[137.28s -> 140.24s]  Everyone get out of here send everybody the sidelines
[150.10s -> 157.78s]  Okay, I'm back I think my game just like a hard crashed dude your net moving is that's not fair that's really good I
[158.80s -> 162.20s]  Click that got the window and it messed up the recording. Just keep doing that
[162.92s -> 166.91s]  What is 13 my way? Who's winning? You're winning by two?
[167.39s -> 171.60s]  All right
[172.52s -> 179.16s]  Keep doing that. Does it use points? I'm out of those points tie it up to a 1312 right now
[179.16s -> 184.76s]  I gotta win this you think you can stop the cows. I don't think I can do you think you can stop
[184.76s -> 186.76s]  I'm sitting on the wrong side. Oh
[187.46s -> 189.46s]  You see that kick
[192.26s -> 195.34s]  13 13 this is gonna get real boring real soon
[196.38s -> 198.38s]  You're probably out of cows
[198.42s -> 201.28s]  You could just why can you just keep moving your net this is bullshit
[203.61s -> 205.61s]  Come on come on. Oh
[207.19s -> 209.75s]  14 13. I'm out of resources, too
[210.43s -> 212.43s]  Now we just have to watch a soccer game. Oh
[213.34s -> 219.42s]  Danny DeVito is moving down mid lane. He's passing it to his teammate. He throws up a force field throws up another crown
[219.94s -> 226.98s]  Would you get these crowns? I told you you could buy hats hats. You could buy hats. Oh, why are you okay?
[227.66s -> 230.30s]  One of the very first things I explained this game has hats
[230.58s -> 235.38s]  I'm just gonna time-lapse the rest of this cuz we're just gonna sit here doing nothing. There's no more no more fun stuff
[235.66s -> 244.30s]  Wow star wins
[245.34s -> 250.00s]  Yeah, I know. Thank you. Thank you very much
[257.14s -> 259.46s]  No, no drop them drop them in the portals
[259.46s -> 262.47s]  I
[266.27s -> 272.85s]  Don't know it's a really stupid plan. I'm going to lose I'm gonna lose. It's 16
[276.82s -> 278.82s]  I only got the balls
[279.86s -> 285.34s]  What is going on over here? What is this? Why is it like a fountain of soccer balls you see?
[285.34s -> 293.09s]  I don't I don't know why you did this. I don't know what decision you were making
[294.17s -> 303.21s]  So yeah, you gotta sit here for two minutes while I'm up 36 to two are you okay with this I
[304.09s -> 308.45s]  Was sitting here thinking of a real strategy. I just feel like an idiot now
[313.33s -> 316.46s]  See I'm trying to win over here and you're just like
[319.18s -> 324.50s]  Have you met me before do it do you know who I am? Oh you want to do cannons you think oh you want to drop
[324.58s -> 329.36s]  Firepower you want to drop some fucking firepower. Is that what you wanted to do?
[336.62s -> 340.64s]  Have I scored any points and my score to call
[346.00s -> 353.46s]  Still get a chance here come on come on pull it through 15 seconds pull it through we need a few more come on
[353.60s -> 355.60s]  Come on come on
[355.92s -> 358.26s]  Get it in there get the ball in there
[358.84s -> 360.84s]  You fuckers
[365.19s -> 367.19s]  Who's gonna go into?
[368.23s -> 373.43s]  No, who is it gonna come into I don't know yes, I don't know
[384.46s -> 387.66s]  I don't know whose goal is whose I have no idea
[387.66s -> 393.28s]  I don't know it's like you know that game with the cups when you put the cups around like the thing and you move the
[393.28s -> 398.40s]  Cups around real fast. No, I don't know. I don't know who's is who I have I had a plan
[398.40s -> 400.96s]  I had a plan here both of our nets
[401.80s -> 404.32s]  Which the one on the bottom is yours one of the bottom is yours?
[404.96s -> 407.04s]  No, it's not is it is
[414.46s -> 421.23s]  Why they're not shooting
[425.59s -> 427.59s]  Why do they not shoot
[431.33s -> 433.33s]  I dropped 36 of them
[445.31s -> 449.47s]  Shoot they don't shoot right away. I dropped like over 30 of them
[449.47s -> 453.48s]  Oh starting off really slow a couple of guys kick around a ball
[457.76s -> 463.08s]  What is what did I get on defense everybody what the hell am I guys just like shitty what's going on here
[463.56s -> 467.72s]  Sing on D. You might have to give them some help. We should probably give them a little bit of help here
