[0.63s -> 14.28s]  Hello. Hi everybody. How y'all doing? I'm doing good. I'm a little tired.
[15.18s -> 21.58s]  But that's because I just got back from the east coast. My plane actually landed really late.
[22.38s -> 27.56s]  So I got in late late late late late last night early early early this morning.
[27.56s -> 35.78s]  I'm a little fucking zonked. But uh we're gonna do we're gonna hang out with some chill.
[36.58s -> 46.06s]  And may as well take in a hot air balloon. Uh we're gonna play Planet Zoo.
[55.88s -> 61.64s]  Those are those are two very distinct dings. I don't even know how I made those sounds.
[65.91s -> 71.19s]  Yeah I must have smiled twice. Now I hope you enjoyed the Halloween stream. Hope you had a safe
[71.19s -> 76.23s]  fun Halloween. After the Halloween stream I ended up staying down there for a little while.
[77.11s -> 84.09s]  Uh get some stuff situated with my family and see some friends. And I just got back.
[85.05s -> 88.49s]  I just I literally ran here from that getting out of the plane.
[89.70s -> 93.78s]  Hey great Canadian FK club. Thanks for the five community subs. Thank you.
[96.09s -> 100.60s]  Let us observe the animals. That's what we're gonna do. Is gonna this is a long tutorial
[100.60s -> 107.21s]  incoming. That's okay. Guy guys it's a long tutorial. All right sorry a sim just yelled at me.
[107.93s -> 112.41s]  Let me put the audio on so you know what I'm talking about. Um this is a long tutorial kind
[112.41s -> 124.86s]  of day. So you know we would do what we're gonna do. Don't abandon Bugleberry. But why would I?
[128.23s -> 131.59s]  Why would I? He just had like five times reverb.
[135.32s -> 141.80s]  I didn't even know. I didn't know that I had that much reverb on until I watched the stream like
[141.80s -> 153.59s]  two days later. I was laughing so hard. It was so much. You could like barely hear what I was saying.
[159.10s -> 163.26s]  Oh I guess like the reverb was going on top of the reverb. Okay when I first watched it I was like
[163.26s -> 169.10s]  oh I did that. Maybe it like gets fixed. Maybe they like drop the audio like the reverb a little.
[169.10s -> 177.96s]  No it got like worse. I screamed. Oh I didn't do anything. Right? This is somebody else doing this.
[181.51s -> 193.43s]  Oh man it was so loud. I didn't know it was gonna be that loud. But hey Bugleberry's pretty good at
[193.43s -> 206.15s]  pottery don't you think? What do you mean no? What do you mean no? What did the doctor have to tell
[206.15s -> 220.95s]  you guys? Oh that I was full of shit. That's what he said and he stormed out. Yep. Come on Dr.
[220.95s -> 225.58s]  Schmoyxen was back. That was a ton of fun. I was so glad to see Dr. Schmoyxen again.
[229.54s -> 240.23s]  Literally full of shit. Was that the same? Yeah that's the same person. We're a legendary doctor.
[244.31s -> 250.36s]  Haunted noises. Jeremiah joined when you had a diaper on. Oh yeah let me talk about the diaper for
[250.36s -> 260.66s]  a second. All right shut up Sim. I was lying in bed in the... I was in a hotel right? I'm lying in
[260.66s -> 268.12s]  bed after that stream and somebody... there's like three or four photos that I saw of like zoomed in
[268.12s -> 274.36s]  diaper full diaper and I put my iPad down and I put rested my head on the back of the pillow
[275.50s -> 289.77s]  and I said was that a mistake to do that? No. It was. It was. It wasn't it? I had this like weird
[289.77s -> 295.21s]  not okay uh look let me like I don't like care about any of that shit right like I don't like
[295.21s -> 300.73s]  I'm not like embarrassed by anything really anymore right but but I don't know why but for
[300.73s -> 306.01s]  like 10 seconds I was sitting there going I was in like a diaper on stream and shit like that
[306.01s -> 312.17s]  I don't know if I should have done that it's weird but no it's okay you know if I get embarrassed
[312.17s -> 321.05s]  for five seconds you know that it was embarrassing your next employer will see it let's hope they
[321.05s -> 334.31s]  think it's funny I gave you guys shit for like saying like bald on stream imagine imagine the
[334.31s -> 341.58s]  person saying that to you that then filled a diaper with slime on themselves the person that's
[341.58s -> 353.30s]  hiring that sees that they might not even let me in the building all right uh but yes I'm back

[556.71s -> 569.78s]  through a career in zoo management oh boy are there 36 tutorials what is this what country is
[569.78s -> 577.38s]  this oh I was gonna say we like we are we like under attack it's like the earth under attack
[579.13s -> 586.95s]  okay so let's do the good the good one house but that's where we're going okay what is this
[586.95s -> 595.48s]  game this is you make your own zoo tutorial all right renovated and renamed after the play
[595.48s -> 602.18s]  what is the lore somebody can read the lore wait update hold on I have to I have to read this
[602.18s -> 606.26s]  actually I'm not gonna skip the tutorials okay renovated and renamed after its purchase by
[606.26s -> 609.70s]  bernard goodwin in the 1980s goodwin house has since become one of the most respected zoos in
[609.70s -> 614.42s]  the country more recently has undergone a further renovation to update many of the habitats and
[614.42s -> 619.70s]  facilities but due to various issues the work hasn't been completed which is where you come
[619.86s -> 641.34s]  from I'm ready I'm I'm excited I am I'm calm excited you know what I mean what's with this
[641.34s -> 658.41s]  loading screen two mega lol tutorial lol I couldn't even no I'm not just gonna burn through the whole
[658.41s -> 670.06s]  thing I need to know how to play I was actually kind of excited for this game oh oh sorry about
[670.06s -> 677.66s]  that I I have a habit of slipping back into the planco language okay it's good to finally meet
[677.66s -> 684.70s]  you in person I'm bernard although I insist you call me bernie the only person who calls me bernard
[684.70s -> 692.86s]  is my wife and even then only when I've tracked elephant dung into the carpets wait throw oh as
[692.86s -> 698.46s]  you know I own why would you have that but I always like to show people the ropes here at my home
[699.18s -> 705.82s]  this is the first zoo I ever opened and the source of great pride for me this is so cool
[705.82s -> 712.79s]  thanks to a lion breeding program we ran in the 80s but we're in the middle of a big renovation
[713.59s -> 719.91s]  that's where you come in sadly our old contractor had to retire after developing a fur allergy
[719.91s -> 726.71s]  peacock or devil kept sneezing his dentures into the lion habitat so it's up to you to finish
[726.79s -> 732.63s]  everything off don't worry though I'm not completely throwing you into the deep end
[732.63s -> 739.91s]  my headkeeper and Nancy Jones will be lending a helping hand whoa oh did you see that jump
[739.91s -> 747.99s]  you to be too but I'm sure that was a fucking fog even better one that isn't on fire less
[747.99s -> 748.87s]  shouting that way
[753.02s -> 759.90s]  okay from that rosy fresh face of yours I'm guessing you're Bernie's new hire
[760.78s -> 764.70s]  good now I hope you're ready to ditch your diploma because we're about to get
[764.70s -> 771.02s]  really hands-on okay but before we begin the real work how about we familiarize you with the zoo
[771.02s -> 776.70s]  by learning how to fly around and visiting some of our beautiful animals okay well these I just
[776.70s -> 782.14s]  have a tutorial and having a look see at the grizzly bear habitat enter enter the grizzly
[782.14s -> 787.42s]  bear animal habitat camera locate the West African lion habitat look at the empty habitat
[787.42s -> 789.82s]  all right well why does have my controls on the screen why are you taking away from me
[791.42s -> 801.45s]  all right find the grizzly bear habitat okay it's right click how do I uh pitch there we go
[801.45s -> 809.34s]  all right find the grizzly bear habitat oh I see it did you know that grizzly bears
[809.42s -> 815.26s]  also known as Ursus Arctos horribilis can hibernate for up to seven months a year
[816.46s -> 820.94s]  but then again given the chance I think a lot of people would do that too I don't even want
[820.94s -> 825.34s]  to play I just want to look look at the bear select one of the bears and you'll bring up
[825.34s -> 833.26s]  its information information panels seven years old this is where you can find out all kinds of
[833.26s -> 838.46s]  information about your animal the most important thing being its overall welfare
[839.18s -> 843.26s]  you'll learn more about animal welfare today as we go through your objectives
[843.26s -> 847.90s]  but for now let's enjoy this magnificent animal why don't you select the camera at
[847.90s -> 857.72s]  the bottom of its information panel okay activate the animal camera so this is it here whoa see now
[857.72s -> 863.00s]  this is a fantastic way to get a close look at your animals you can also get this view of an
[863.00s -> 867.32s]  animal by simply double clicking on it yeah that's much easier to do all right well that's cool
[867.32s -> 871.48s]  okay when you're ready let's pop over to the other side of the zoo what is he gonna go
[871.48s -> 874.20s]  is he gonna take a bath marked their location for you to find
[879.38s -> 892.39s]  do you get to watch him eat but I don't even care I just want to watch okay what's he doing with his
[892.39s -> 903.74s]  bum all right uh let's go back okay if uh enter the grizzly bear what is he doing oh shit okay
[903.74s -> 913.13s]  uh locate the west african lion habitat okay let's get out of here right uh west uh west
[913.13s -> 922.10s]  african lion habitat where is it over here all the west african lion to you and me
[922.90s -> 928.90s]  lions are the most social cats and they can be as many as 40 lions in a pride although prides of
[928.90s -> 936.10s]  that size are pretty rare as bernie would say those lions are awesome which is precisely why
[936.10s -> 941.62s]  i handle the training instead these days what is that how about we get started on those objectives
[941.62s -> 944.82s]  they have like a little like a pinata in here and see what he's doing
[945.78s -> 957.80s]  do i pick up the coin pinata enrichment what oh it is a pinata why are they why the pinata is
[957.80s -> 969.70s]  in here okay look at the empty habitat now what we got empty habitat this way my first animal
[969.70s -> 974.90s]  i can't wait it's gonna be kangaroo no it's gonna be armadillo no it's gonna be a raccoon i want two
[975.06s -> 984.79s]  raccoons all right i got it it's right there right as you can see it's a lovely space for animals
[984.79s -> 992.79s]  but it's missing a certain something beavers two somethings warthogs so i'd like to adopt a pair
[992.79s -> 997.99s]  of them to adopt animals we need to open the animal market which is in the animal trading
[997.99s -> 1007.77s]  section people watching right now okay um animal trading there we are a pair of perfectly splendid
[1007.77s -> 1013.53s]  warthogs for our zoo just click on them and select adopt from the side menu normally the animal
[1013.53s -> 1017.77s]  exchange would be full of animals but i've emptied out the market while you learn how it works
[1017.77s -> 1022.25s]  okay so we got the last thing i need is you accidentally ordering a dozen elephants
[1022.25s -> 1028.25s]  what's wrong with that okay well i'm being drip fed content because the game knows that i would
[1028.25s -> 1035.35s]  just click this button a thousand times and then have to restart the tutorial so it's size longevity
[1035.35s -> 1041.59s]  fertility zoo all right let's get one so just send to zoo waiting in the trade center
[1042.78s -> 1054.74s]  send to zoo delivery scheduled how many do i need two when you adopt an animal it's automatically
[1054.74s -> 1059.30s]  placed in the trade center where they're held until you're ready to move them into their habitat
[1059.30s -> 1066.66s]  which as it happens you are so how about you move them into their new home okay animal store wait
[1066.66s -> 1075.21s]  animal storage okay so this is animal market animal storage trade history are these stocks
[1075.77s -> 1083.83s]  okay so common warthog in trade center move to here when you ask for an animal to be moved into
[1083.83s -> 1089.35s]  a habitat your caretakers will go to the trade center collect your animal and deliver them to
[1089.35s -> 1094.63s]  your selected habitat i've marked the trade center's location so let's go and watch the
[1094.63s -> 1102.49s]  caretakers in action oh it already happened okay so animal trading does it where's the trade center
[1105.22s -> 1118.87s]  oh okay i got one look it loves its new pen no get out i want to talk i want to get in here
[1119.59s -> 1142.10s]  what the warthogs are fucking ugly what do you mean no i'm sorry warthog looks like five animals
[1142.10s -> 1153.90s]  combined hey what i didn't say i hated it i just said i said i said that warthog was ugly that
[1153.90s -> 1162.26s]  doesn't mean i hate the warthog okay so i have one okay i got two in here now what's the uh how do
[1162.26s -> 1173.46s]  i feed them animal storage okay so i have two in here so what was it what's the next part what's
[1173.46s -> 1185.66s]  the woman to do but how do i feed them because of nature habitat habitat the tutorial like just
[1185.66s -> 1194.54s]  gave up on me what was i supposed to go to the trade center first i marked it on your map oh
[1194.54s -> 1202.12s]  okay it's over here well as you can see those caretakers don't hang about they'll move those
[1202.12s -> 1207.32s]  animals to their destination as fast as possible right of course normally we'd have to place the
[1207.32s -> 1213.56s]  animals into quarantine before moving them into a habitat but i am assured by a good standing
[1213.56s -> 1220.20s]  that these warthogs are in the very rudest of health okay right let's get the warthogs habitat
[1220.20s -> 1225.24s]  finished up so we can keep them nice and happy what do they eat each animal in the zoo has an
[1225.24s -> 1231.32s]  overall welfare statistic basically how happy they are and that overall welfare statistic is
[1231.32s -> 1236.36s]  it self-compressed of four different areas nutrition social health habitat
[1238.76s -> 1243.72s]  luckily if you select an animal you'll bring up their animal welfare information panel which
[1243.72s -> 1249.80s]  we saw earlier where you can see how they're doing that way you'll know exactly what areas need to be
[1249.80s -> 1254.20s]  addressed but don't worry if that's a lot to remember you can always check the zoopedia for
[1254.20s -> 1261.96s]  more information are they not supposed to be eating this let's start elephants care of the
[1261.96s -> 1267.16s]  warthogs nutrition welfare at feeding station and water station to place a food station and
[1267.16s -> 1273.24s]  a drinking station now each animal requires a different type of feeding station and for
[1273.24s -> 1280.44s]  the warthogs it's a small feeding trough so pick up put in case and a water bowl no stop okay
[1280.44s -> 1288.90s]  uh habitat uh we have water bowl food through small for water bowl okay so 100
[1288.90s -> 1295.03s]  dollars that's a lot of money for just a big fucking box objects can be placed pretty much
[1295.03s -> 1299.75s]  anywhere use the commands below to help change the position okay so you rotate raise and lower
[1300.71s -> 1309.48s]  that's weird can they put it in the ground okay rotate is z that's i'm gonna have to remember
[1309.48s -> 1323.48s]  that rotate toggle advanced mode is x oh god you get like these kind of like blender controls
[1324.66s -> 1333.86s]  oh no i don't care about that oops how do i move it no why do i have two what have i done
[1334.89s -> 1345.80s]  uh they can't reach this okay raise it how do i edit it why did i go into like the second life
[1345.80s -> 1361.42s]  editing mode how do i edit it well m hold on angle snap reset height is shit okay shift reset height
[1362.30s -> 1367.48s]  there we go okay align to surface is v that's good all right i'm gonna put it like over here
[1368.12s -> 1371.08s]  let's put like their feeding tray over on the rock so people can watch them eat
[1372.12s -> 1376.20s]  and they can like look up and like sneeze the food on people i like that okay how about here
[1376.92s -> 1397.35s]  right here right there okay and then now we need a uh water dish align to surface and um yeah uh
[1397.43s -> 1409.24s]  all right closely no this is like kind of huge all right how about over here so they can like
[1409.24s -> 1429.43s]  yeah i want them to like lift up and be able to be like can i angle it that's extremely
[1429.43s -> 1436.87s]  unhygienic you sign away before you go to the zoo that bath will count towards their enrichment
[1436.87s -> 1443.67s]  welfare specifically their toy enrichment welfare mud bath okay get it as close to the people as
[1443.67s -> 1463.10s]  possible okay um how about like right here right in the corner right there oh nice work you've
[1463.10s -> 1468.70s]  got a knack for this i see now our contractor had to leave in a hurry so this place is in a
[1468.70s -> 1474.86s]  shadow state unfinished splash zone what sits all over the shop but the first thing we need to
[1474.86s -> 1481.10s]  finish is the ostrich habitat it's over near the hippos is this full do i have to fill this or is
[1481.10s -> 1493.27s]  it full if how do i put food in here all right let's go to the ostriches this i'm gonna mix
[1493.27s -> 1498.47s]  my zoo is gonna be so bad before we actually start building our ostrich habitat let's pause
[1498.47s -> 1507.38s]  the game just click the pause button in the bottom right corner okay ah that's more like it so can
[1507.38s -> 1511.38s]  you do anything when it's paused sometimes it's a good idea to pause the game whilst you're doing
[1511.38s -> 1515.62s]  something which requires your concentration because it'll stop the zoo spinning out of
[1515.62s -> 1520.18s]  control while you're looking the other way let's keep the game paused while we get this ostrich
[1520.18s -> 1527.62s]  habitat built okay job number one here is to add a habitat gate before we complete the barrier
[1527.62s -> 1532.50s]  every habitat needs a habitat gate after all how else would the keep are there dinosaurs in this
[1532.50s -> 1536.50s]  game without t-rex's here make sure it's hooked up to the path so the keepers can reach it
[1539.02s -> 1548.39s]  habitat gate right there right oh it has to be in the gate right here how about like where
[1548.39s -> 1553.67s]  this is a tutorial let's complete the perimeter barrier so we can adopt us some ostriches
[1554.31s -> 1558.55s]  i've marked out an area for you to use so i'd like you to finish off the perimeter using the
[1558.55s -> 1564.97s]  brick barrier okay so that is just as simple as just snapping it and dragging it or clicking oh
[1564.97s -> 1585.99s]  okay oh nice well this is kind of intuitive good work remember before you can place animals in any
[1585.99s -> 1592.87s]  habitat it has to have a full loop of connected barrier now you've probably noticed that guests
[1592.87s -> 1598.15s]  can't actually see into this habitat at the moment at least not without a step ladder but
[1599.59s -> 1604.39s]  i'd like you to select a piece of barrier and swap out the brick for a glass barrier so the
[1604.47s -> 1612.02s]  guests can see in the whole thing or just like one section just make everybody crowd around it
[1612.66s -> 1621.16s]  yeah like right here highlight sections then click the grab glass barrier and browse it okay
[1621.72s -> 1627.16s]  there we go adding in more windows gives guests even more opportunities to see the animals in
[1627.16s -> 1632.44s]  a habitat i want crowded areas here make sure the guests can get a good view into a habitat from the
[1632.44s -> 1637.88s]  path they're walking on because it makes them happy and because this would be a pretty terrible
[1637.88s -> 1641.40s]  zoo if they couldn't why don't do the whole thing glass then the last thing we need to do
[1641.40s -> 1647.32s]  is to add a donation box you see when guests enjoy the view of an animal they'll make a donation
[1647.32s -> 1651.24s]  just make sure you put them in easy to reach places like near a viewing point
[1651.88s -> 1657.24s]  donation boxes are one of the main sources of income for the zoo so make sure you remember them
[1658.76s -> 1669.51s]  this is the main source of income is through people wow okay this is a lot like streaming
[1670.92s -> 1676.54s]  i'm just behind the glass here now before we adopt our ostriches you should click the play
[1676.54s -> 1682.06s]  button after all if the games pause then so are our caretakers which will make it a bit tricky
[1682.06s -> 1687.02s]  for them to deliver the ostriches eh okay so complete the ostrich i don't even have any
[1687.02s -> 1693.02s]  ostriches by the way as well as pausing the game you can speed the game up by clicking on the fast
[1693.02s -> 1698.30s]  forward button it'll run everything at two times and five times faster five times it can be useful
[1698.30s -> 1701.82s]  especially if you're waiting for money to accumulate or for animals to be delivered
[1701.82s -> 1706.22s]  to your habitat personally i use it when i'm waiting for a brew to finish
[1707.34s -> 1712.14s]  all right you finished the habitat so it's height and we adopted those ostriches don't you think
[1712.78s -> 1721.00s]  let's get four of them in here ostriches are really tall right now let's see animal uh
[1721.00s -> 1730.23s]  marketplace common ostrich do they have rarities like is it like legendary ostrich epic ostrich
[1733.64s -> 1742.01s]  do they actually have that all right this one's why this one's 464 at all how does it what's this
[1742.01s -> 1750.82s]  mean okay well i'm just gonna tell you i'm gonna get a naio okay i'm waiting in the trade center
[1751.94s -> 1766.98s]  uh move to here relocating to habitat 22 all right let's go hurry up where are you let's go
[1766.98s -> 1773.24s]  get in why does somebody have to bring a box over here like okay here we go
[1782.60s -> 1794.04s]  this is opening loot boxes is that what they did in this game they can i just buy crates
[1794.04s -> 1802.79s]  to open them and it's like what's nutrition all right now i got a feeding zone what about
[1802.79s -> 1812.23s]  this do they want sprinklers is an ostrich like a three-year-old kid well no i don't think we want
[1812.23s -> 1822.73s]  these okay so let's go to habitat uh food and water feeding state do i need two of these
[1823.53s -> 1836.42s]  how many do i need do i need more than one well i'm gonna get the i'm gonna get the expensive one
[1841.10s -> 1852.30s]  five did you say five i have to get all four of these while we wait for them to be collected
[1852.30s -> 1857.82s]  by the caretakers and brought to the habitat you should get it ready for them add a suitable
[1857.82s -> 1864.78s]  feeding station water station and an appropriate food enrichment item it's often best to place
[1864.78s -> 1869.66s]  things like enrichments and feeding stations near to the habitat perimeter so guests can get
[1869.66s -> 1877.98s]  a really good view of the animals wait the mouse is fucked up hold on a second here why is this
[1877.98s -> 1892.02s]  happening because right now right now i'm over the ostrich i'm selecting the ostrich right now
[1893.66s -> 1906.38s]  what the hell is going on here wasn't this happening before hold on a second yeah this
[1906.38s -> 1929.58s]  shit was happening before too this makes no sense alt tab no okay this what why is this happening
[1933.90s -> 1939.22s]  hide cursor in game trying to try changing window to full screen let me let me see what happens if i
[1939.22s -> 1945.48s]  just do full screen this is weird maybe it is already in full so no it's borderless all right
[1945.48s -> 1967.83s]  what if i just do full screen there we go okay weird all right let's get going so does this guy
[1967.83s -> 1971.59s]  have to go back and get another one and then come back and bring it what is it is this the only
[1971.59s -> 1981.77s]  person that's here doing this all right anyway i need habitat all right uh water throw they like to
[1981.77s -> 1989.66s]  drink out of trees don't they no that's a brontosaurus um how about in the corner no no
[1989.66s -> 1994.38s]  over here i want over here so they can like put water in the mouth and like go up and like spit
[1994.38s -> 2017.37s]  it out over it people okay food bowl all right that's good and then a slow feeder all right
[2018.33s -> 2026.76s]  good to see the ostriches have somewhere they can really stretch one joke did you know they can
[2026.76s -> 2035.24s]  actually run at 43 miles per hour oh heaven forbid they ever escape the speed camera finds alone
[2035.24s -> 2047.93s]  would bankrupt us all right i did it visiting player bernie certainly seems impressed speed
[2047.93s -> 2055.85s]  camera joke every time we get an ostrich so now we've made the ostriches lives a bit better
[2055.85s -> 2060.33s]  let's do the same for the keepers shall we so somebody's visiting the zoo for the keepers to
[2060.33s -> 2065.69s]  feed the ostriches and hippos we should build a new keeper hut the keeper huts are where the
[2065.69s -> 2070.73s]  keepers prepare the food for animals so they should be placed near to the habitats to make
[2070.73s -> 2075.53s]  sure the keepers don't waste their time walking when they should be looking after the animals
[2101.21s -> 2110.50s]  who is this visiting player who is this person visiting player it's freaking me out i didn't
[2110.50s -> 2114.26s]  listen about the phone all right keeper huts are found in the facilities menu all right
[2115.06s -> 2124.23s]  plays a keeper hut uh let's do this one you'll need to rotate the keeper huts to get it to connect
[2124.23s -> 2135.37s]  up to the path how it helps all right uh where did it want me to put this how stupid is it being
[2135.37s -> 2149.59s]  dark souls invaded all right over here that's really ugly how about here right there this keeper
[2149.59s -> 2155.59s]  hut only has space for one keeper but the larger keeper hut can allow multiple keepers to prepare
[2155.59s -> 2160.71s]  food at the same time is this her apartment is where they live that keeper huts and other
[2160.71s -> 2164.87s]  staff facilities shouldn't be placed near to areas where there are lots of guests
[2165.67s -> 2169.83s]  guests don't like seeing facility buildings and it can affect their happiness
[2170.79s -> 2178.87s]  negatively in case that was why something that's all facilities shops and a whole host of other
[2178.87s -> 2185.51s]  i don't want to see i only i i want to pretend like i'm in the savannah let's place a transformer
[2185.51s -> 2196.54s]  next to it shall we well yeah like downtown san francisco oh yeah sorry it's not like this
[2196.54s -> 2202.50s]  fucking savannah you know you don't know that now those i don't like seeing that that building
[2202.50s -> 2208.18s]  that powers the place bury it so disney world's like that there's like fucking a whole city
[2208.18s -> 2217.75s]  underground now the reason everything is ugly is because you're using the power heat map this map
[2217.75s -> 2222.87s]  allows you to see what is and what isn't powered in your zoom oh man so once you've placed your
[2222.87s -> 2230.10s]  transformer you can click in the bottom left to turn the heat map off okay so this is what's
[2230.10s -> 2236.44s]  powering so anything that's in this circle is being powered they're not going to do like a
[2236.44s -> 2242.76s]  factorial type thing are they lovely work now the keepers can start using the hut to prepare food
[2242.76s -> 2246.76s]  and thanks to where you've put it they won't need to walk very far to deliver it to the ostriches
[2246.76s -> 2254.60s]  and hippos let's get on to your next objective then bengal tigers we want to adopt some but i'm
[2254.60s -> 2259.40s]  afraid there's nothing ready for them yet head on over to the plot of land i've marked out it's not
[2259.40s -> 2266.62s]  too far away in the next building it's the research zone and the transformation zone
[2267.58s -> 2274.09s]  here you can put two strength potions in with an ostrich and you'll get a strength-based ostrich i
[2274.09s -> 2293.48s]  can't wait for that shit what is the objective i wasn't paying attention i forgot a highlighted
[2293.48s -> 2303.40s]  area okay righty your next job is to build a habitat from scratch and concrete and really
[2303.40s -> 2309.00s]  expect so go ahead and build it just make sure that the habitat includes that big hole we've dug
[2309.00s -> 2316.52s]  oh and don't forget to add a habitat gate to the barrier okay so build a build a bengal tiger
[2317.16s -> 2355.83s]  be able to see the tigers sure not climbable water tight climb that there's a climbable rock
[2361.37s -> 2364.65s]  like it's i just the tutorial i don't care i just i'm just trying to learn how to do everything
[2364.65s -> 2374.38s]  all right now we fill this hole with what was what is what was it good add the gate complete
[2374.38s -> 2381.10s]  the habitat boundary okay we need a gate um how about like over here now like in the back this
[2381.10s -> 2389.88s]  way now bernie takes safety very seriously at his what is he trying to do here probably make
[2389.88s -> 2395.88s]  sure those tigers can't jump out of their habitat don't you think the way we'll do it is by changing
[2395.88s -> 2401.88s]  the height of the height of the barrier okay then you should start by double clicking the habitat
[2401.88s -> 2411.13s]  barrier which will take you into barrier editing mode okay angles are here length height great now
[2411.13s -> 2415.69s]  highlight the entire perimeter of the habitat you can do that by clicking and dragging the
[2415.69s -> 2433.94s]  barrier selection tool drag this widget to select the habitat then drag this okay you just now you've
[2433.94s -> 2438.98s]  got all of the perimeter selected you can increase the height of it by clicking and dragging the
[2438.98s -> 2445.06s]  barrier height tool upwards you'll want to make sure it reaches a height of at least 3.7 meters
[2445.06s -> 2451.94s]  3.7 meters can i change this to like i'm an american is this it click and drag it
[2458.04s -> 2468.49s]  turn this into like a baseball stadium all right how about right here let's do four whatever now
[2468.49s -> 2473.77s]  that the habitat is in place don't forget to put down a donation box near to your viewing areas
[2473.77s -> 2479.61s]  i have to make like fenway park yeah i'll do that especially as these tigers aren't exactly eating
[2479.61s -> 2488.94s]  instant noodles for lunch okay donation box always remind me that the donation box is in
[2488.94s -> 2494.23s]  facilities because i will forget should i put more than one like put like two or three of them
[2494.95s -> 2501.19s]  well people are gonna be watching from here okay that's the habitat boundary complete the
[2501.19s -> 2507.43s]  habitat gate in place and most importantly the tigers won't be able to jump out of it anymore
[2507.43s -> 2517.66s]  i think it's time we adopted those tigers okay animal market uh
[2518.62s -> 2524.30s]  this is a very large increase we went from like two hundred dollars to ten to twelve thousand dollars
[2527.59s -> 2537.42s]  here whilst our trusty caretakers collect and deliver the tigers let's take a look at preparing
[2537.42s -> 2543.50s]  the habitat for their arrival we'll start feeding station lake add a suitable feeding station for
[2543.50s -> 2562.90s]  them okay this is a food a large food tray i think i would like to eat here instead of adding a
[2562.90s -> 2568.10s]  water bowl these food trays are solo panels some animals need a pool in their habitat so they can
[2568.10s -> 2573.38s]  go for a swim but they can also use it to drink from all you have to do is make sure the banks
[2573.38s -> 2579.14s]  of the pool have a gentle slope so they can easily get a nice refreshing drink there's already a pool
[2579.86s -> 2584.98s]  but you still need to fill it with water you should do that by going into terrain and selecting
[2584.98s -> 2593.26s]  the water tool okay water here it is calm water or rough water calm water right
[2594.14s -> 2600.78s]  add water is just left click and move water oh that's kind of scary uh water is an essential
[2600.78s -> 2604.54s]  part of many animals lives so it's important in fact to consider when building a zoo many animals
[2604.54s -> 2610.86s]  need a body of water in their habitat to swim keep cool and drink from if if water is necessary
[2610.86s -> 2614.46s]  in this way it'll be highlighted along with any space requirements in the terrain tab of the
[2614.46s -> 2621.70s]  animals info panel okay create a space to put the water eg create a pit or lake with the terrain
[2621.70s -> 2625.78s]  tools highlight the position of the wall in the space for the water to be filled click to fill
[2626.58s -> 2632.82s]  some barrier wall types are capable of holding back water yes that'll do nicely of course just
[2633.06s -> 2638.82s]  the war togs and ostriches these tigers will also need some enrichment why don't you add some that
[2638.82s -> 2644.97s]  looks like the bottom of a urinal that does not look like a pool so i can save money okay
[2645.93s -> 2665.38s]  okay let's put check it out how is it this is gonna make mud drinking it just eating
[2665.70s -> 2683.35s]  mud they're both gonna have diarrhea in like three hours all right so what i'm gonna do place a
[2683.35s -> 2697.29s]  toy and food enrichment item enrichment frozen blood pumpkin why is there blood in this pumpkin
[2701.00s -> 2710.76s]  and a rubbing pad here come here you can like use the rubbing starting to take shape now the tigers
[2711.40s -> 2716.68s]  are in their habitat so they can hide from the guests or more like do they drink blood out of
[2716.68s -> 2722.68s]  a pumpkin in england is this for real if that just is normal weather go on add a shelter to
[2722.68s -> 2729.08s]  the habitat why are tigers fucked up suitable bits and bobs or if you like just pop down the
[2729.08s -> 2746.84s]  blueprint that i've already built for you what oh oh god they're eating his brain they're eating
[2746.84s -> 2768.01s]  his brain just take that clip like i'm sorry okay uh so which way is correct should i put some
[2768.01s -> 2780.62s]  solar panels on this way do they like to be facing people or not facing people oh poor dabs i'm sure
[2780.62s -> 2785.58s]  it can't have escaped your attention that the tigers look a bit miffed that's because they are
[2785.58s -> 2792.38s]  too keen on the type of terrain habitat select a tiger and bring up its information panel okay
[2792.38s -> 2798.94s]  it doesn't like its habitat we'll fill it with water click on the terrain tab that way you can
[2798.94s -> 2803.66s]  view the terrain information and see how they feel about the different types that'll tell you
[2803.66s -> 2815.75s]  what the tigers need more of or less of in this habitat okay you need more terrain plants okay
[2817.51s -> 2824.41s]  i gave you more water all right you want more plants all right okay then open the terrain
[2824.41s -> 2830.65s]  editing tool select painting and give them some more soil yes that should help with the habitat
[2831.93s -> 2839.37s]  okay terrain painting tool that if he was like sprinting all right you want more short grass
[2841.56s -> 2856.47s]  okay i can do that for you oh you want to cut the grass oh i see tigers don't like uh grass
[2856.47s -> 2861.19s]  to be long what happens if i go too far outside the lines oh i'm just in this habitat that's awesome
[2863.61s -> 2872.17s]  you can't color outside the lines looks good wait wait whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa too much
[2874.71s -> 2897.22s]  less grass okay whatever you okay goldilocks there's too much now there's too much long grass
[2898.10s -> 2917.82s]  animal needs less long grass how much soil soil okay we need less long grass
[2918.70s -> 2924.54s]  it's almost perfect right then all animals need plants and trees from their own biome or continent
[2924.54s -> 2931.10s]  you know desert savannahs or asia you look at the thing looks like these tigers need a few more
[2931.10s -> 2937.50s]  plants in their habitats to get a perfect fit use plants from the rainforest and temperate biomes
[2937.50s -> 2944.86s]  that are native to asia farming minus two farming minus two farming minus two the tigers will also
[2944.86s -> 2949.82s]  want a certain amount of their habitat to be covered by those plants to find out which plants
[2949.82s -> 2956.78s]  to use and how many select a tiger and go to the environment tab okay so let's take a look
[2956.78s -> 2962.22s]  so that's now as you can see some of the plants currently in the habitat aren't quite right for
[2962.22s -> 2969.42s]  the tiger like the wattle bushes wattle bushes why would they put them here okay the the wattle
[2969.42s -> 2973.74s]  bushes you can find all of the plants you need in the nature section and you can use the filters
[2973.74s -> 2978.86s]  to only show the types of plants you want to see in this case that's plants from the rainforest
[2978.86s -> 2985.70s]  or temperate biomes use filters to get the correct continent and biome for tigers
[2987.78s -> 2999.11s]  um what do we want here well first hold on a second you've got too many things open on
[2999.11s -> 3007.22s]  my screen at once now can i make this thing like 10 smaller hold on get out of here like
[3007.22s -> 3020.54s]  let me go come here plants yeah i know so if i go to your not enrichment terrain terrain okay
[3021.10s -> 3030.62s]  okay so uh environment plants and coverage continent asia biomes tropical temperate and
[3030.62s -> 3038.46s]  grassland but you don't like these so how do i just i want to just delete these like how do i just get
[3038.46s -> 3054.66s]  rid of these all right so we need we're gonna do tropical so tropical and then asia sure it's down
[3054.66s -> 3066.97s]  here so let's do uh tropical and asia all right so you want some of these how about uh coconut
[3067.77s -> 3075.13s]  coconut palm that would be cool over here right here let's put it up here so like the coconuts
[3075.13s -> 3097.37s]  drop and i'll keep his heads can i straighten this thing up why is it so bent okay looks all
[3097.37s -> 3107.43s]  right i want to get rid of this how do i just delete these delete this is gonna be an easier
[3107.43s -> 3123.14s]  way for me to do this right all right how about a a bangle bamboo right there all right oh i thought
[3123.14s -> 3129.19s]  i put that down all right you look like you're all right how's your environment doing you want
[3129.19s -> 3138.94s]  more plants all right get rid of this thing where's this can i like go to plant all right where's this
[3138.94s -> 3145.86s]  thing ready this tree they don't want this tree they hate this thing okay now let me put and they
[3145.86s -> 3157.38s]  want more plants how why do you want so many do they really want that many more or how about um
[3158.34s -> 3180.47s]  like a little group of these over here okay and then how's that how do i clean up their shit
[3183.70s -> 3191.10s]  what's what's pre-recorded actually pre-recorded what are you talking about what is actually
[3191.10s -> 3204.57s]  pre-recorded now i want it smaller here we go like all right is that is that fine do you like that
[3205.37s -> 3209.10s]  i mean no one said that you all of you were saying that i need more of this
[3213.96s -> 3236.20s]  coverage zero percent how much more do you want all right let's go with temperate asia and you want
[3236.20s -> 3249.35s]  like some elm trees this is so huge though this just blocks view put on your face cam not put on
[3249.35s -> 3274.34s]  my face cam okay and then how about like down here it's more tree than animal
[3276.42s -> 3282.10s]  they say the good fences make good neighbors i guess that's doubly true when one of the neighbors
[3282.10s -> 3289.54s]  is a bengal tiger all right cool still those tigers look so happy that i doubt they'd leave
[3289.54s -> 3295.90s]  even if you didn't poke a hole in their fence oh but for heaven's sake don't test that theory
[3296.86s -> 3304.71s]  i'm not gonna move this right let's head over to the indian peafowls i've been told that we need to
[3304.71s -> 3312.42s]  improve their social welfare okay i'm starting to get it there's a maze in here this is cool
[3312.42s -> 3316.98s]  just find one of the peafowls and select them to open an information panel then we can have a good
[3316.98s -> 3321.30s]  gander at how they're doing is this maze for me i suppose ganderin would just be for geese
[3322.74s -> 3328.82s]  found one expand their social welfare and we can get a bit more detail
[3329.62s -> 3334.42s]  social group there are too few adults and juveniles in animals social group
[3335.14s -> 3339.70s]  uh now they've clearly got plenty of space and they're not stressed but it looks like
[3339.70s -> 3345.54s]  this social group isn't quite right so let's find out more click on the social tab at the top of
[3345.54s -> 3354.18s]  their information panel adult population is only two right as you can see the peafowls need their
[3354.18s -> 3359.46s]  population to be larger to solve this little problem you'll need to adopt three more female
[3359.46s -> 3371.24s]  people three female power to the animal market then okay here we go uh we need female bring them
[3371.24s -> 3388.68s]  in i think i'm gonna play this like all night good work on those people but sadly it sounds
[3388.68s -> 3393.24s]  like our snow leopard is a bit grumpy let's head over there and see what's wrong with her
[3393.32s -> 3407.08s]  something about the snow leopard i don't know how to snow leopard just like people animals can
[3407.08s -> 3412.12s]  suffer from stress if things aren't quite right you know like how shitty that is in the milk
[3412.12s -> 3417.40s]  before the teabag in the case of these snow leopards they're a bit stressed by their lack
[3417.40s -> 3423.64s]  of privacy you can lower their stress levels by swapping out the normal glass barrier by their
[3423.64s -> 3428.60s]  cave for one-way glass i don't see any stress not a cheap option but i think they're worth the
[3428.60s -> 3433.32s]  expense don't you this will give the snow leopard somewhere to go when they want to get away from
[3433.32s -> 3454.50s]  the prying eyes it's going up it's gonna jump over i just like realize how fucked up this is
[3457.69s -> 3467.24s]  that'd be like i might have like looked out my window they were like 700 people all looking in
[3467.24s -> 3478.98s]  the window by the way this is when i'm showering wow this is getting a lot of money imagine you
[3478.98s -> 3482.18s]  get out of the shower and you're just brushing your teeth with a towel around your waist
[3483.70s -> 3490.34s]  and you turn around and your whole the whole wall of your bedroom and your bathroom is glass
[3490.34s -> 3498.68s]  and there are just people staring there watching you like take a shower i'm getting out of there
[3498.68s -> 3513.27s]  that's what's gonna happen all right so what do i need to do uh one way glass barrier
[3517.99s -> 3522.17s]  how much just enough to make them i don't understand like
[3522.17s -> 3529.22s]  like the whole thing or just a little bit just where everybody's standing
[3530.34s -> 3536.34s]  okay so that's selected now how do i say yes
[3544.63s -> 3561.14s]  what i'm just doing oh right okay well this is even worse how do i what's going on here
[3561.14s -> 3569.46s]  okay um what
[3575.37s -> 3578.82s]  i did it right that's not me doing it
[3583.18s -> 3598.92s]  is it no wall this is a wall here already i don't understand what's going on one way glass
[3600.12s -> 3619.30s]  like select it but it's there so why is it still telling me to do this i'm selecting the wall one
[3619.78s -> 3632.84s]  way wait one way glass from the outside that's what only the window part of course when an
[3632.84s -> 3638.76s]  animal isn't in its natural biome it's probably going to be too hot or too cold unsurprisingly
[3638.76s -> 3645.16s]  for the snow leopards it's it's too hot i can't just select it you should help cool it down by
[3645.16s -> 3650.36s]  adding some coolers to their habitat but let's start by opening up the temperature heat map
[3650.36s -> 3654.12s]  and having a look see at the temperature in the leopard's habitat heat map
[3655.88s -> 3663.22s]  open the heat map this is electricity oh okay as you can see we already have one cooler in there
[3663.22s -> 3667.78s]  let's pop some more down and get as much of the habitat as chilly as we can there's like too much
[3667.78s -> 3673.70s]  going on this habitat already has power but you'll need to make sure that in the future just so you
[3673.70s -> 3680.58s]  know if any part of a habitat is powered then the whole this whole place is on fire look at how hot
[3680.58s -> 3693.27s]  it is in here is that safe okay coolers so where should i put this just it doesn't matter anywhere
[3694.95s -> 3712.22s]  over here how many do i want to put down okay is that better and it's did they're working yeah
[3718.31s -> 3730.41s]  habitat 91 yeah this is this is fine put them in the middle these people are freezing
[3733.75s -> 3737.03s]  so the whole habitat's supposed to be like this well i would have done that
[3740.41s -> 3745.13s]  you can find heat maps for all sorts of helpful things so do be sure to explore them and make
[3745.13s -> 3751.05s]  good use of them okay this coolers and heaters it'll take a little while for the temperature to
[3751.05s -> 3756.09s]  adjust once you've added coolers or heaters but now we've got the coolers in we can address the
[3756.09s -> 3761.29s]  leopard's terrain welfare you see what the leopards really want in here is snow and rock so let's make
[3761.29s -> 3768.63s]  that happen so somebody just half-assed this part okay terrain so you want snow
[3770.74s -> 3785.94s]  just the whole thing we're just painting this on the ground this is horrible this is so cruel
[3786.74s -> 3817.78s]  protesters have arrived at your zoo what it's only one right when i say it
[3821.83s -> 3827.11s]  okay let's all of that should give you a pretty good understanding of how to make animals happy
[3827.43s -> 3833.11s]  so i'd like you to go and check on all the other animals any issues with their habitat care given
[3833.11s -> 3837.83s]  to your animals increase the average welfare of the animals across the whole zoo why didn't you
[3837.83s -> 3845.03s]  tell me about this welfare is a very important statistic now to quickly see how all your animals
[3845.03s -> 3849.83s]  are doing in the zoo somebody's not doing okay management and then into the animals section
[3849.83s -> 3857.70s]  zoo management and then go to the animal section as you can see this list shows you the animals
[3857.70s -> 3862.98s]  overall welfare so if something's a mess then you can quickly pop over to them using the locate
[3862.98s -> 3868.50s]  button right i'm going for a cut by while you make sure all the animals are well looked after
[3868.50s -> 3883.02s]  enrichment habitat oh wait it's the zebras you're contraceptive so what how do i go how do i go over
[3883.42s -> 3889.51s]  all right all right what's wrong with this place wait this is us but there's a switch of giraffes
[3889.51s -> 3896.58s]  in here where did you come from okay what's wrong with this habitat let's find out what do you think
[3896.58s -> 3902.95s]  what's wrong welfare your habitat sucks and your enrichment sucks too insufficient food
[3902.95s -> 3908.15s]  enrichment is being provided to cover all animals and there's not enough toys in here okay and
[3909.62s -> 3915.86s]  this is not a good i didn't do this yeah just just get on like the the playground thing that
[3915.86s -> 3921.54s]  spins around everyone will have fun on that all eight of you can sit on it all right let's do um
[3922.66s -> 3931.16s]  terrain so what's the what's wrong with the terrain what kind of terrain do you like
[3932.81s -> 3937.58s]  you like okay there's not there's not enough short grass there's not enough long grass and
[3937.58s -> 3945.93s]  there's too much soil well shit let me i'll take care of this no no no terrain all right there's
[3945.93s -> 3972.73s]  not enough short grass let's do this around the bank plenty of rocks intensity and just that's
[3972.73s -> 3983.99s]  better they have like nice green grass over here okay grass is good now we need some long grass
[3983.99s -> 3990.90s]  i'm gonna do long grass over here um this way back behind here are they even enclosed
[3991.86s -> 4009.34s]  let's do they don't want any soil so it's all short and long grass all right take out the soil
[4010.22s -> 4025.21s]  this looks better all right so that's better took care of that wait there's too much there's not
[4025.21s -> 4031.59s]  enough short grass now i got it okay so that's okay now you guys are happy what about the giraffe
[4031.59s -> 4037.19s]  the giraffe is the only one in here is the giraffe the weird outlier here oh shit okay now special
[4037.19s -> 4049.43s]  food enrichment for a second i thought they were enriched by zebras and i'm thinking what kind of
[4049.43s -> 4056.71s]  fucked up environment is this no that's a species bonus okay all right so the environment they don't
[4056.71s -> 4063.58s]  like these trees so why did he put them all here they're everywhere how many are in here
[4065.64s -> 4078.57s]  there's so many of these in here why are these all in here it's for the tutorial yeah but i mean
[4078.57s -> 4087.24s]  still come on what the hell are you thinking uh where is it new environment it's every tree
[4087.24s -> 4099.26s]  just delete every tree i tell you i'm gonna make this mistake first all right you better
[4099.90s -> 4115.43s]  is there any more here no it's still well it's hard to even see these select button in bottom
[4115.51s -> 4127.02s]  right multi-tool select click and drag to create a selection they can drag to add to selection
[4127.02s -> 4132.71s]  holds control to toggle selection but i don't want to get rid of everything at this point
[4132.71s -> 4143.78s]  i guess i can just do this no no that's good to know is it all these trees okay are we good now
[4143.78s -> 4157.18s]  you need more stuff right oh what else is left get these out of here this is not even in your
[4157.18s -> 4177.19s]  enclosure what because you can see it you don't like it oh my they just hate trees they but
[4177.83s -> 4189.30s]  i didn't know that oh my fucking god okay we're just starting from scratch fuck it i don't even
[4189.30s -> 4210.87s]  care i'm just deleting everything no not the shit outside just this shit here no no no no
[4210.87s -> 4221.06s]  why is this stuff selecting that what are you doing why are you selecting the what are you doing
[4223.99s -> 4243.59s]  hey okay we good is it any more just random one tree that i need to delete there's probably like
[4243.59s -> 4249.03s]  one or two more things here okay you better no then we where we hit this is a hidden object
[4249.03s -> 4259.94s]  game find the fucking dumb trees that we put here what else oh my fucking god can i just delete all
[4259.94s -> 4270.17s]  of them just delete them all why is this all in here just delete all what delete the zoo
[4270.17s -> 4278.06s]  delete zoo looking for trees what holy shit somebody's gave a lot of money
[4281.06s -> 4291.58s]  doctor doctor give me the news thanks for the 50 dollars thank you doctor how do i delete this
[4297.64s -> 4301.64s]  not pre-recorded why would the stream be pre-recorded i can't i can't just like mass
[4301.64s -> 4310.86s]  delete this there has to be a way right like select and then like so oh my god i have to
[4310.86s -> 4326.36s]  give it all of these all of them just leave it i can't they hate it i want to just fucking
[4326.36s -> 4337.27s]  delete this why did it select that fuck all right i need to put that wait oh hold on hold on hold
[4337.27s -> 4344.12s]  on uh doctor doctor thank you for the 50 dollars 5 000 bits just came in let me pause this
[4347.26s -> 4355.22s]  they say uh i'd like to shake your hand if you ever get to another convention on the west coast
[4356.60s -> 4363.62s]  i would love to do that too thank you so much for the 5 000 bits really appreciate it it's a lot of
[4363.62s -> 4373.96s]  fucking money thank you i hope he washes his hands i do and then there was another 5 000 before that
[4374.68s -> 4384.22s]  by the same person was actually a hundred dollars it was 10 000 doctor doctor gave 10 000 bits
[4385.40s -> 4391.00s]  they say they actually say first time donator but a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a big big big
[4391.00s -> 4396.04s]  fan of yours that's not this they didn't write all that i've been a big fan of yours for years
[4396.04s -> 4400.60s]  so this is a long time coming i know you always say never feel bad for not donating more money
[4400.60s -> 4405.32s]  but i wish i could unfortunately my job security isn't great right now so there's the best i can do
[4405.32s -> 4409.24s]  but i still wanted to give back at least a little to both the man and the stream that have helped me
[4409.24s -> 4415.03s]  like countless others through some of my darkest times you'll never know the true depth of your
[4415.03s -> 4428.44s]  effect on so many people jeremy thanks a lot that means a shitload i'm glad that you can have fun
[4428.44s -> 4434.28s]  here seriously and i know i say it all the time don't feel bad for not donating money like for
[4435.00s -> 4442.89s]  that's not necessary take care of yourself take care of yourself first you are number one
[4444.17s -> 4447.53s]  put me somewhere else down that list take care of yourself i wish you the best
[4448.25s -> 4460.39s]  so moving on i have to lead it to a few too many things somebody was saying it doesn't matter does
[4460.39s -> 4476.50s]  it really not matter at all wait is this he's he's escaped wait that fails the tutorial
[4477.46s -> 4488.50s]  he's going are they biting people why would you run towards the animal all right i get i
[4488.50s -> 4501.03s]  understand the gist of the game is there a rewind is there a rewind button is this how giraffes
[4501.03s -> 4515.50s]  sleep that's fucking crazy what don't you get a stiff neck okay all right i get it i get it i
[4515.50s -> 4526.41s]  understand how this works uh come here come here get over here how do i pick you up call the vet how
[4526.41s -> 4546.89s]  do i pick you up emergency capture but how do you this is disabled by the tutorial so how do i get
[4546.89s -> 4559.56s]  them back where are they look i didn't mean to delete this i'm trying to delete plants because
[4559.56s -> 4564.92s]  it's like they don't like the shrubs in there get rid of them they they hate it was it the sims
[4565.72s -> 4569.80s]  when you have a painting in the room that the sim doesn't like they're like fun goes to zero
[4569.80s -> 4578.52s]  there's an undo at the bottom wait can i
[4586.01s -> 4599.56s]  how do i get the animals back in no no no where are you going where are you going how do i get
[4599.56s -> 4616.97s]  these animals back in here he's just walking around all right how do i delete this part
[4616.97s -> 4631.66s]  here come here just let him walk around let them roam no i i i need to do the second tutorial
[4633.58s -> 4638.78s]  okay let's do this come here this is temporary i didn't want to fuck this whole thing up but i
[4638.78s -> 4653.46s]  have to get rid of this shit how do i delete this road call the keeper i i can't can i not even i
[4653.46s -> 4662.25s]  don't think i can do that call vet because look i can't i can't let go of the emergency capture
[4662.25s -> 4672.52s]  is vet gonna go over here what about this call the vet they'll walk back in when i'm when hungry
[4675.29s -> 4676.81s]  it's going to the bathroom
[4676.81s -> 4680.28s]  oh
[4685.83s -> 4691.03s]  there's a line out the door to leave he can't even escape what the hell was that
[4691.75s -> 4713.37s]  what you got sniper rifle what the fuck just keep keep get him i didn't want it to go to like to
[4713.37s -> 4726.25s]  shit
[4727.85s -> 4733.21s]  he can just step over this he can step over this it's like a baby gate are you serious
[4740.65s -> 4745.05s]  i just because i deleted this that was bullshit okay well the the vet's on duty
[4746.46s -> 4766.79s]  what habitats invalid what's wrong with this what what's wrong did i buy something hold on a minute
[4766.79s -> 4789.54s]  what the fuck is going on here that's a chain like that how about a brick wall all right are
[4789.54s -> 4803.54s]  we still good this is an in fact well how did it become invalid how did i fuck this up i don't
[4803.54s -> 4828.25s]  understand what's wrong with this how many are in here all right what i what is wrong with this
[4828.25s -> 4846.02s]  gate marked as not a habitat boundary where what how did i screw it up is it this part here that's
[4846.02s -> 4856.52s]  the problem i soft locked it the fence was fucked up how did i fuck up the tutorial well it's very
[4856.52s -> 4861.64s]  easy because i was selecting i was selecting the bushes over here and it was selecting this
[4861.64s -> 4866.84s]  fucking building and i deleted the building when i was selecting the bushes here i did it like
[4866.92s -> 4873.45s]  10 times you sure you don't want to pick up this building and delete it look i'm moving on to the
[4873.45s -> 4882.60s]  next tutorial i know what i'm doing i soft locked myself somebody said why were they
[4882.60s -> 4888.74s]  selecting the bushes because they don't look they don't like bushes they fucking hate them
[4890.55s -> 4893.67s]  and it was like there's something wrong with their habitat they don't like the bushes
[4895.08s -> 4903.74s]  no get look see well you know they really really don't like those trees they don't like the bushes
[4903.74s -> 4910.55s]  either they hate them so i have to go through and get rid of these oh they're gonna hate their
[4910.55s -> 4924.34s]  environment no i know how to play i'm done we're gonna play like all these plants need to be
[4924.34s -> 4949.72s]  deleted wait what is it 90 well they hate everything in here okay well okay enrichment
[4949.72s -> 4960.58s]  we need food in here habitat all right how about food and water food cage what am i trying to do
[4960.58s -> 4965.22s]  here enrichment but what what do you want for species food enrichment and toy enrichment
[4968.20s -> 4974.68s]  zero enrichment items okay bamboo feeder walk of frozen fruit that sounds pretty cool who's it for
[4980.15s -> 4995.48s]  no wait can i do by giraffe all right let's do it by giraffe what kind of giraffe is this
[5001.45s -> 5015.67s]  reticulated giraffe okay uh big high suspended high feeder there you go okay and a sprinkler toy
[5016.31s -> 5027.24s]  that hurts my eyes all right so that's good all right so you're fine one habitat cleaning
[5027.24s -> 5036.18s]  wait there's a disease habitat cleanliness is a disease risk for what i don't even know
[5036.18s -> 5044.01s]  where i'm going the lemur we haven't gotten that far in the tutorial yet i can't believe i deleted
[5044.01s -> 5053.21s]  that fucking building because i'm trying to select a goddamn bush so what's wrong with this place
[5053.93s -> 5068.84s]  i this is power is it like cleanliness habitat temperature water power buildings negative impact
[5068.84s -> 5078.36s]  on guests why is it doing this habitat climate is a disease risk let's put on your fucking x-ray
[5078.36s -> 5111.50s]  goggles how did somebody okay i get it i have to get out of this i have to play a new scenario
[5111.50s -> 5123.85s]  it's all it's fucked forever all right i know i'm gonna do a different scenario
[5127.69s -> 5140.38s]  that was fucking horrible okay let's go back to the main menu um should i save it i guess i'll
[5140.38s -> 5160.42s]  save it just whatever uh it's because the journey okay main menu we're gonna do a different i need i
[5160.42s -> 5173.35s]  still need to learn i still need to learn how to play i'm still learning i opened up another
[5173.35s -> 5184.74s]  scenario see okay we are i'm already done with the goodwin house the madagascan simian conservation
[5184.74s -> 5201.13s]  project tutorial okay this is just going to teach us some new things no tutorial no i have to do
[5201.13s -> 5204.73s]  there's a lot of systems in place i need to at least kind of have somewhat of an idea what the
[5204.73s -> 5224.82s]  hell i'm doing i can't i'm having trouble i can't get over it welcome to madagascar it's quite the
[5224.82s -> 5231.46s]  change of scenery from dreary old england apart from the weather i suppose they don't call these
[5231.46s -> 5239.06s]  places rainforest for nothing the zoo you'll be working in is an ape sanctuary we're doing
[5239.06s -> 5245.54s]  vitally important conservation work not just for apes but for all kinds of species but apes
[5245.54s -> 5251.78s]  well apes are some of the closest relatives to humans there are and yet the way the world treats
[5251.78s -> 5260.54s]  them is like well very much like some of us treat our actual relatives anyway that's why i'm
[5260.54s -> 5266.14s]  determined that our operation here does some good if we can all leave some part of the world in a
[5266.14s -> 5272.86s]  better state than we found it we'll have lived lives worth living and speaking of states i have
[5272.86s -> 5278.86s]  a horrible feeling i left the house in a right one when i get back i expect my life will be worth
[5278.86s -> 5295.02s]  living at all this is bernie's primate sanctuary it's not just primates though we've got all sorts
[5295.02s -> 5300.22s]  of animals so why don't we go and have a look at some of them eh we'll start by taking a look at
[5300.22s -> 5304.86s]  the red rough lemurs they're the ones that look like they should be in a shakespeare play
[5305.66s -> 5313.69s]  come on let's head over to them okay i think i'm gonna be all right okay locate the highlighted
[5313.69s -> 5324.38s]  area there it is this is a nice little setup i thought these were sinks from back here that's
[5324.38s -> 5331.42s]  in northeast madagascar oh cool they can actually live anywhere from 15 up to 25 years that's a long
[5331.42s -> 5337.82s]  time okay when you're ready let's go find out bornean orangutans i like this little
[5337.82s -> 5349.50s]  playground that they have hey let's find the orangutans the bornean orangutan is such a
[5349.50s -> 5355.02s]  marvelous creature they're always a big favorite at any zoo they feature in and they're also the
[5355.90s -> 5361.66s]  dwelling animal on the planet assuming you don't count any lions that got stuck up one
[5362.46s -> 5367.18s]  oh why don't you take a better look at them open up that information panel and go into the
[5367.18s -> 5377.48s]  animal camera okay let's go let's take a look aren't they just incredible i like the zoom
[5377.48s -> 5382.04s]  in feature it's really cool when you're ready let's go and have a look see it some of our
[5382.04s -> 5399.30s]  beautiful bonobos they're quite the characters what's that noise you can do cinematic camera
[5399.30s -> 5408.36s]  okay yeah all right let's go to the other place these habitats are really well done i want to make
[5408.36s -> 5414.31s]  like a habitat from scratch that's pretty much what i care about oh dear it looks like we've
[5414.31s -> 5423.67s]  arrived just in time one of the habitat's barriers has collapsed we'll need to catch them but before
[5423.67s -> 5429.67s]  we do we should box up the other bonobos to stop them escaping too select the habitat boundary to
[5429.67s -> 5440.39s]  bring up the habitat information panel okay good now open the animals tab animals and click on box
[5440.39s -> 5449.58s]  all animals box all animals whoa we'll need a vet to recapture that escaped bonobo but it seems our
[5449.58s -> 5455.58s]  last one left to do some research in the wild not an ideal situation so we'll need to hire a
[5455.58s -> 5461.82s]  replacement sharpish hire a vet go into the zoo section and then into the staff management area
[5461.82s -> 5468.22s]  staff and then i know you can find all of your staff in here so there's no time to go looking
[5468.22s -> 5475.66s]  at their particulars at the moment hire a vet hire a vet now click on one of the paths to place
[5475.66s -> 5482.54s]  the vet in your zoo right there great now let's deal with our escapee before they can cause too
[5482.54s -> 5491.22s]  much havoc okay use the animal alerts to jump to the escaped bonobo okay right here call the
[5491.22s -> 5501.16s]  vet on the call vet button to call the vet over to capture it okay that's a relief so while the
[5501.16s -> 5507.72s]  vet deals with our bonobo friend let's go fix up their habitat okay is it i understand okay i get
[5507.72s -> 5513.24s]  it that this is like dangerous and scary but like it's just one monkey
[5514.20s -> 5542.20s]  oh did he trip this guy i don't give a fuck okay ah so now i have relocating as you can see the
[5542.20s -> 5547.32s]  barrier's collapsed someone's taken their eye off the ball obviously let's get this one replaced
[5547.88s -> 5552.36s]  this is what i needed to know last time and then we'll edit it okay delete the broken section of
[5552.36s -> 5560.65s]  barrier and replace it with a brand spanking new one the broken section of barrier okay so right
[5560.65s -> 5568.60s]  here so you have to you have okay you have to delete the part first how do they break it
[5569.40s -> 5599.46s]  obstructed i'm not gonna leave like a barn door open like connected whether wrong am i insane
[5600.98s -> 5608.26s]  i'm not right okay now that we've done that we need to make sure to add barriers to the top
[5608.34s -> 5612.50s]  that way the bonobos won't be able to climb out just make sure you've got the correct
[5612.50s -> 5619.70s]  piece of barrier selected when you do that climb proof options climb proof so go into the option
[5619.70s -> 5624.98s]  section and select which side the climb proof barrier needs to go on and don't get it wrong
[5625.78s -> 5629.38s]  we're more worried about bonobos climbing out than guests climbing in
[5630.74s -> 5636.50s]  people will climb into these things nicely done and i think it's high time we unboxed those bonobos
[5636.82s -> 5641.30s]  that's not correct the poor mites will get sad if we leave them in there for too long
[5642.34s -> 5646.10s]  select the habitat barrier to bring up the habitat information panel again
[5647.22s -> 5661.05s]  okay what is it select the habitat information panel and then open the animals tab animals
[5662.01s -> 5668.97s]  unbox all animals and finally click on unbox all animals to let them out i expect some of them
[5668.97s -> 5678.22s]  are fair bursting for the toilet it turns out that as well as the old vet leaving the zoo's
[5678.22s -> 5682.94s]  mechanics realistic sounds we'll need to hire a couple of new ones so we can help stop any more
[5682.94s -> 5689.98s]  breakouts why do all sorts of helpful things around the zoo but one of their most important
[5689.98s -> 5695.42s]  jobs is taking care of the habitat barriers without mechanics around to repair them the
[5695.42s -> 5701.66s]  barriers will crack crumble and fall down and before you know it will be overrun with escaped
[5701.66s -> 5707.34s]  animals so don't do wood section and then into the staff management area again make it out of
[5707.34s -> 5716.70s]  cement and then paint it to look like a tree right what's the i don't understand hire a mechanic and
[5716.70s -> 5726.41s]  then click on a path to place them in the zoo okay and then click on the path again to hire a second
[5726.41s -> 5731.69s]  mechanic as you can see you don't have to go back into staff management if you're hiring lots of
[5731.69s -> 5737.56s]  the same type of staff member okay so now they're going to be able to watch
[5740.68s -> 5750.25s]  i'm off for a cuppa oh i think bernie wants a word with you what does he want oh i hear you had a bit
[5750.25s -> 5756.01s]  of an issue with an escape bonobo the main thing is that you dealt with it swiftly and more
[5756.01s -> 5760.81s]  importantly without the animals stealing someone's clothes putting them on and then walking out of
[5760.81s -> 5767.21s]  the front gate i thought that was an animal you see another key responsibility for our vets
[5767.21s -> 5773.21s]  oh these things are vicious by the way researching animals allows vets to unlock new enrichment items
[5773.21s -> 5778.09s]  additional information for our education resources enhanced breeding programs and
[5778.09s -> 5784.81s]  improvements to food quality oh the animal's food not the vets it'll take more than a research
[5784.81s -> 5791.05s]  grant as you can see research is a key part of running your do it
[5792.09s -> 5798.49s]  in order for a vet to undertake research they require a research center and once again that's
[5798.49s -> 5803.69s]  something that this zoo is missing so let's build one i've marked out an area for you to put it
[5803.69s -> 5814.90s]  a research center right here now you've probably noticed that there's already a building where i
[5814.90s -> 5820.18s]  want you to build the research center don't worry you see the building that's currently there is
[5820.18s -> 5826.18s]  actually a hollow shell so we're able to place our new building inside of it if you select the
[5826.18s -> 5830.74s]  research center for placement and then hover over the shell you'll see that it asks if you
[5830.74s -> 5839.26s]  want to add the research center to the existing building okay so okay click to add it to the
[5839.26s -> 5844.70s]  building oh but that won't place it in just yet though first we'll need to rotate our research
[5844.70s -> 5863.08s]  centers which automatically connects to the path when we place it uh okay wait okay ensure auto
[5863.08s -> 5870.20s]  stacking is off to make splendid work now that we have a brand spanking new research center we can
[5870.20s -> 5876.44s]  give our vets something to do in there oh by the way it's worth noting that the vets will only do
[5876.44s -> 5882.12s]  research when they're not required to do any other jobs that said you can change what jobs a vet does
[5882.20s -> 5885.96s]  does have a bunch of vets how much money you get to start with let's not worry about that just now
[5886.92s -> 5893.64s]  so let's get our vet researching ring-tailed lemurs go into the zoo section and select vet
[5893.64s -> 5901.40s]  research vet research and then bugs you can see a list of all the animals present in your my first
[5901.40s -> 5907.88s]  zoo is going to be bugs only potential diseases that can occur now let's have a cockroach on to
[5907.88s -> 5917.13s]  the ring-tailed lemur to start their research one star megan what is up with this actually
[5917.13s -> 5922.25s]  thinking about it i'm not sure we've got any education i'm gonna have like 10 000
[5924.17s -> 5929.77s]  let's head over there and add some so our guests can learn all about the fairy little delights
[5929.77s -> 5940.41s]  okay so this is first off let's pop down to education educational boards place them on
[5940.41s -> 5945.69s]  the habitat barriers at a height that guests can see or if you like pop them down on a stand
[5947.80s -> 5950.36s]  yeah well i would do that but i think what i'm gonna write here is
[5953.64s -> 5959.48s]  private chests don't do not open i'm gonna put two of them here back to back next to my
[5959.48s -> 5982.82s]  storage box what was i making an educational board what the hell is it i thought they were
[5982.82s -> 5987.22s]  throwing stuff into the habitat workshop trade center research center what's it what's it what's
[5987.22s -> 6009.80s]  it called information board education board facilities uh is it not in there what it
[6011.00s -> 6032.18s]  find education boards in here okay what the fuck are you talking about oh this no god this is ugly
[6033.85s -> 6054.09s]  a line to surface okay and then one over here okay now that they've been put into position
[6054.25s -> 6059.13s]  we have to tell them what animal to display information about select one of the education
[6059.13s -> 6066.41s]  boards to bring up its information panel habitat education board okay educational content from the
[6066.41s -> 6075.85s]  drop down list select ring-tailed lemur yeah when you link an education board or a speaker to an
[6075.85s -> 6081.77s]  animal you need to make sure that said animal is close by if it isn't the guests will get confused
[6081.77s -> 6088.97s]  and won't learn as much okay ring-tailed lemur cool okay now that we've done the education boards
[6088.97s -> 6094.33s]  let's pop down a pair of speakers speakers play audio to the guests so they can learn while they
[6094.33s -> 6098.97s]  look at the animals instead of having to go through the laborious process of reading
[6099.61s -> 6105.13s]  okay one thing to bear in mind is that it's important not to put the speakers too close
[6105.13s -> 6110.09s]  together if you do the guests won't be able to understand what's being said why
[6111.29s -> 6117.03s]  what was that that was like in this is like a flash mob but what are they doing
[6122.62s -> 6144.86s]  okay um speakers educational speaker oh right here and then right here now we simply need to
[6144.86s -> 6149.66s]  link the speakers to the ring-tailed lemurs just like you did with the education board okay
[6149.66s -> 6156.74s]  okay now i'm gonna put like 10 of these next to each other and have each one of them be a different
[6156.74s -> 6169.83s]  animal it's gonna be unfucking bearable fantastic oh it's worth remembering that education boards
[6169.83s -> 6176.55s]  and speakers both need power to work they won't do much good without it so any power supply
[6176.55s -> 6181.83s]  it looks as though our vet has completed their research on ring-tailed lemurs we'll need to
[6181.83s -> 6187.59s]  collect the results we can do that by clicking on the notification or by going back into the vet
[6187.59s -> 6195.67s]  research area okay let's take it up go on okay what do you got collect my research just so you
[6195.67s -> 6201.03s]  know vets will continue to research an animal even after successfully completing a research
[6201.03s -> 6207.35s]  level take them off i suppose when you're in the zone you're in the zone ring-tailed lemur level
[6207.35s -> 6212.71s]  six now that we've enriched the lives of our guests let's enrich the lives of our ring-tailed
[6213.11s -> 6217.83s]  well i gotta collect the research some animals like lemurs will have a climbing need that means
[6217.83s -> 6222.07s]  they have a requirement for a certain amount of climbing space and you can fulfill that
[6222.07s -> 6226.71s]  requirement by building them a climbing frame okay we'll hope let's find out how much more
[6226.71s -> 6232.23s]  climbing space our lemur friends need shall we select one of them and bring up their information
[6232.23s -> 6241.88s]  panel so how many you need oh wow they hate this next click on the terrain tab they need land area
[6241.88s -> 6245.88s]  they don't care about water you can see they need climbing zones quite a lot more climbing
[6245.88s -> 6250.76s]  space but as it happens i've already got a climbing frame blueprint built for you so you
[6250.76s -> 6256.76s]  can either pop that down or build one yourself from scratch by the way it's not always just
[6256.76s -> 6261.00s]  climbing needs that you have to worry about this thing other animals might need a certain amount
[6261.00s -> 6266.44s]  of water in their habitat so they can go for a swim they certainly do keep us on our toes
[6267.40s -> 6297.10s]  wow look at this but what i can just make my own no wait hold on move get rid of this
[6308.62s -> 6332.36s]  so you have a huge view no i want give me the small one too tall give him a space to go out
[6333.16s -> 6345.06s]  no not yet not yet that's for like in like in like 20 minutes all right i want to like hold on
[6345.06s -> 6373.96s]  it's not snapped to surface here we go i want to bring this up there we go like come on get on there
[6373.96s -> 6414.54s]  what this one that'll stand right is that enough i know it's disgusting but it doesn't matter
[6415.10s -> 6421.64s]  environment what do you want terrain okay i need more than that all right how about um
[6424.30s -> 6459.30s]  habitat climbable shift it around like this do they jump okay i'm gonna wrap around this way
[6460.02s -> 6484.82s]  and then go up here what's this guy doing like i had like a what is he doing
[6485.30s -> 6492.46s]  oh wait wait connect this all right this is gonna go a little bit higher from here
[6493.58s -> 6497.98s]  this here how much more space do you need there we go all right now i'm gonna connect this
[6515.67s -> 6527.56s]  that does not look stable at all that's very that's like dad dad's first tree house for the kids no
[6527.56s -> 6532.30s]  it's not that's huge and horrible i would never want a child on this all right that looks good
[6532.30s -> 6541.35s]  so that's they got their climbable area now what else they need social enrichment
[6542.84s -> 6558.04s]  species toy enrichment okay so they need oh well hold on he loves it he loves it
[6558.84s -> 6569.83s]  well he's having so much fun he just he just jumped from here to there look at how high up this is
[6569.83s -> 6589.58s]  he just did he shit i think god you gotta go up to the very top oh he's got itchy ears now take it
[6589.58s -> 6596.09s]  away from him tell him make him learn life is cruel this would cost more money to dismantle
[6596.09s -> 6611.83s]  than it did to put up don't miss don't miss that's dangerous oh look at that one all the
[6611.83s -> 6633.42s]  way to the top yeah whoa oh that was insane i can't believe you made that can you get down
[6633.42s -> 6662.78s]  is this a baby does tail up mean like i'm scared oh no no it's good go for it again let's see the
[6662.78s -> 6676.20s]  jump again come on impress us big jump nice nice that was cool you guys didn't like my structure
[6676.20s -> 6680.60s]  and now you say that's like the favorite thing in the world all right we need some uh toy shit
[6681.48s -> 6694.47s]  uh so i need some toys these lemur toys who's been in a box wait wait wait what
[6694.47s -> 6704.62s]  means they've been in a box for too long why are they in a box why are you putting them in boxes
[6704.62s -> 6726.76s]  why are you in why are they in boxes that's weird all right i know a lemur toy oh cardboard box watch
[6726.76s -> 6736.58s]  this shit oh yeah you better believe it they're gonna get the skateboard too up here block of ice
[6740.87s -> 6756.09s]  musical skateboard oh yeah all their toys will be up here beach ball they're gonna love this
[6756.81s -> 6765.72s]  okay now social severe social welfare issues insufficient size or crowding issues are present
[6766.44s -> 6771.78s]  are you all right though like overall you're okay we need to expand it
[6777.03s -> 6786.01s]  it's because this is too big um maybe i should drop get rid of some of these
[6786.01s -> 6796.31s]  i think let's get rid of this one hey why are you capturing my lemurs what are you doing stop
[6796.31s -> 6814.94s]  doing that who's doing that i need more space can i just pull this out they need more space
[6819.77s -> 6830.58s]  social okay animal has moderate social yeah but i need to make this bigger too many lemurs
[6831.46s -> 6835.62s]  is that why she's deleting them wait we might get a skateboard what the fuck was that
[6842.90s -> 6854.87s]  he just did a superman jump uh okay can somebody play the keyboard look there's a fox up here
[6854.87s -> 6882.46s]  who's gonna get in first hey that was not very nice uh i think they're fine
[6886.23s -> 6893.19s]  i love the long jump i want to make an even bigger one yeah they're fine wait
[6897.58s -> 6921.45s]  yes look at how smart he is vet research is complete oh i did it you've discovered three items
[6922.94s -> 6931.67s]  all right so let's put you i wasn't i what do i do here what's the next part of the tutorial
[6932.31s -> 6946.81s]  because i mean they're space too crowded so should i like put cockroaches in here
[6946.81s -> 6950.25s]  i know i'm gonna we're gonna i'm gonna do the bug zoo all right you know what i think i know
[6950.25s -> 6961.75s]  what i need to know uh i can't just do this i think it's time for me to make my bug zoo
[6964.31s -> 6996.15s]  free the hippo where's the hippo where's the hippo here no where's my just where's my animal
[6996.15s -> 7024.97s]  chart okay let's go with uh here we go where are you over here can't delete this can i not
[7024.97s -> 7032.62s]  delete this berry i can't delete it in the tutorial it won't let me it does not want me to delete this
[7045.82s -> 7057.30s]  well oh well you have to run the tutorial in administrator mode what if i make it easy to
[7057.30s -> 7072.94s]  get out no the game definitely doesn't want me to do this right now no no i can't all right
[7073.74s -> 7084.04s]  well i know what i'm doing now it's time for me to make my zoo let me save it it's time i want to
[7084.04s -> 7100.97s]  make my insect zoo why can i delete the building in the last one okay here we go franchise build
[7100.97s -> 7111.22s]  zoos all around the world and trade your animals online let's do uh franchise or sandbox sandbox
[7113.21s -> 7120.81s]  create new zoo scenario zoo create new i don't i did like all right what's the best bug zone
[7120.81s -> 7136.74s]  probably tropical right north america let's go to name the zoo uh bugs is there more than
[7136.74s -> 7151.51s]  just cockroaches or am i just gonna have big cockroach bug world bug world is so easy roach
[7151.51s -> 7168.34s]  ranch roach ranch is pretty good let's go north america roach ranch you guys are gonna have to
[7168.34s -> 7180.39s]  help me out here though holy shit this is the biggest bug zoo you've ever seen so i'm gonna
[7180.39s -> 7189.45s]  pause it here's the entrance all right is it like okay barriers blueprints construction
[7191.98s -> 7205.05s]  uh construction uh terrain oh we did paths okay here we go path um this is fine we'll go out like
[7205.05s -> 7224.81s]  this just to start it go up four and then all right ray's path is u oh all right lower path is j
[7225.69s -> 7231.13s]  what else is there increase length that's what i want it's it's a weird thing to have for increased
[7231.13s -> 7242.87s]  length okay i can actually put this down here too width i want this a little wider okay that's a

[10258.98s -> 10264.49s]  it's got to be broken up back here you know i'm saying like this is gonna be shit over here too
[10264.49s -> 10269.69s]  it's gotta be broken up with a few more with like some trees and shit that's the issue that i'm
[10269.69s -> 10286.44s]  seeing it needs one mega tree because then i'll put something in here and yeah i mean this is
[10286.44s -> 10298.25s]  that's the problem that was the problem okay all right i'll i'll go back to this and finish
[10298.89s -> 10315.56s]  whatever was that moss oh ivy oh oh wait hold on cool all right i don't want to hold on i want
[10315.56s -> 10352.78s]  to make it so it doesn't now that actually is a haunted house i can't do it don't stop it
[10362.78s -> 10369.24s]  no less is more get rid of this one in the middle it's two it's two one two three you know what i

[10376.18s -> 10385.77s]  two that's fine there okay that's better i like that this looks like shit but i can't really move
[10385.77s -> 10399.64s]  it anywhere i guess could i angle it let me see if i can angle this can i angle it down i guess
[10399.64s -> 10409.22s]  that defeats the entire purpose of a solar panel that looks a little better all right so now
[10410.94s -> 10413.82s]  all right now it's time to get a real animal in here this is going back here
[10416.15s -> 10429.02s]  i'm bringing in something ridiculous i want like how about hmm i want to have like the
[10429.02s -> 10436.46s]  what the lemurs are the ones that jump around right yeah okay i want a lemur enclosure like all
[10436.46s -> 10443.02s]  over here and i want to have a huge like obstacle course alligators that's not bad either let's do
[10443.02s -> 10454.58s]  alligator first all right habitat i need alligator can i do it by animal species okay alligator
[10457.90s -> 10468.78s]  what are these called croc is a crocodile or alligator saltwater crocodile there we go so i
[10468.78s -> 10482.23s]  need a basic shelter with dimensions shelter with a eat the pumpkin brain all right uh i need the
[10482.23s -> 10490.25s]  walls first barrier okay so okay what kind of crocodile not go through just make a hedge maze
[10493.38s -> 10502.86s]  concrete what kind of glass that would be kind of cool all right this is gonna go
[10504.12s -> 10507.24s]  there's gonna be like a couple of shops here and then it's gonna lead into the alligator
[10507.24s -> 10515.16s]  enclosure so i'm gonna say like right here we'll go because there'll be the entrance this way
[10515.80s -> 10528.92s]  so i'll go like this across here i wonder how big does it need to be crocodiles are my favorite
[10528.92s -> 10550.01s]  bug i think that's all right i should be able to close it up here okay let's get an entrance
[10552.15s -> 10557.75s]  out this way oh shoot i'm gonna pull this in so they can look down to the alligators that's
[10557.75s -> 10584.60s]  perfect it's too small is it really is it it's gotta be bigger than this is that all right
[10590.65s -> 10602.65s]  bigger than this no way no this is huge okay so now i'm gonna get the gate on here habitat gate
[10604.36s -> 10612.60s]  there all right now i need all right so this is an alligator habitat what are what are alligators
[10612.60s -> 10632.42s]  like what should i have in here like five ten of them okay they need okay source compare mates

[10658.86s -> 10672.65s]  i'll do two of these and then two females that's not a gator it's a crocodile isn't it
[10672.65s -> 10692.70s]  okay then here we go we'll do uh two uh two so we go there's more are we remaking that game where
[10692.70s -> 10698.94s]  every city the city's run off by animals huh all right now i gotta get the environment correct
[10699.74s -> 10707.35s]  because what are alligators like i guess i need them to be there first and then pause it
[10708.07s -> 10723.08s]  all right well this it's there i need water that's very very clear person's got a really
[10723.16s -> 10731.83s]  long run what are they running to oh shit somebody called it an order i gotta run
[10732.71s -> 10747.32s]  where are you going someone needs to feed the roaches you run into the bathroom i hope he runs
[10747.32s -> 10762.65s]  to the bathroom so far to go oh i need another okay we need more staff rooms oh here we go
[10764.66s -> 10771.53s]  here the alligators all right what do you like what's wrong zoo alert keeper hut too small
[10772.25s -> 10779.90s]  wait is it this doesn't have any power no fuck okay hold on pause it that's why he had to run

[10802.89s -> 10809.21s]  right okay so let me let me get these are the need what do you guys like you want water
[10810.09s -> 10818.33s]  okay let's get rid of this tree because it's useless right now okay you're good for coming
[10818.33s -> 10827.56s]  in so we need some we need to dig up some water very important they need critical size or crowding
[10827.56s -> 10840.06s]  issues um okay well first of all let's do water terrain uh sculpting so we need to go down
[10842.63s -> 10846.15s]  we told you how big does this shit need to be this is like the whole park
[10847.03s -> 10851.83s]  i can fix it it's all right all right so let me go to size drop the intensity drop the size
[10852.47s -> 10863.29s]  this would be the little the little area over here i can't really see what the fuck i'm doing
[10863.29s -> 10875.69s]  how deep does this need to be this looks too deep actually they do want deep water don't they
[10887.06s -> 10900.30s]  need more intensity okay how's that maybe a little bit more what does too deep mean for
[10900.30s -> 10914.86s]  a crocodile they can swim right that's true yeah that's completely right it's gonna have to be
[10914.86s -> 10935.11s]  like 80 of their enclosure right they want to like swim around okay then they can well that's too
[10935.11s -> 10951.75s]  much hold on bring that i have to bring this back up okay they need like a place to come out and eat

[12149.69s -> 12158.78s]  uh doesn't matter what it is grade six semi-transparent not climbable
[12159.66s -> 12184.02s]  oh this would be nice because they can now they can turn around look at this way too
[12184.58s -> 12201.61s]  this would be cool this would be where they sleep and then i can all right i'm gonna i gotta get
[12201.61s -> 12213.51s]  rid of this wait this is an electric fence that'll be all right let us not turn it on all right pause
[12213.51s -> 12231.78s]  it for a second how do i tie this okay it's gonna go this way and it'll connect right here
[12232.90s -> 12236.42s]  yeah i'll deal with that later it's gonna connect right there and then it can go around and there
[12236.42s -> 12249.72s]  we go yeah you got it you understand let's keep going what are you doing this no stop stop what
[12249.72s -> 12257.75s]  are you doing so they can look down into the enclosure and they'll be able to see it they'll
[12257.75s -> 12263.99s]  be able to jump up and like look at them and stuff right that's big enough for the lemurs i think
[12263.99s -> 12285.13s]  yeah oh it needs to be higher well i mean it's not a t-rex so it doesn't need to be that high
[12286.97s -> 12294.02s]  no because then they can't see over this no no i want it down here it has to be below this so
[12294.02s -> 12311.59s]  they can look in this is a high security lemur all right so there we go now okay lemurs climbable
[12311.59s -> 12318.07s]  right okay um i have to build this out oh there's already cool stuff here
[12319.54s -> 12331.24s]  holy shit that's awesome oh that's so cool look at how cool this is all right oh it's gonna go
[12331.24s -> 12350.84s]  like this in the corner can they jump they go from here to there are they smart enough for that
[12351.56s -> 12369.56s]  so how are you supposed to keep them in i want a huge jump no fuck this delete this
[12370.52s -> 12386.02s]  okay ready i want it to go from here across the hallway they're gonna do these huge jumps
[12386.66s -> 12400.50s]  wait am i i need the long one this is not gonna fall over is it no give me the wizard longest one
[12400.58s -> 12437.30s]  six meters there we go the fuck did i do that i better idea how high is i want this to go as high
[12437.30s -> 12450.79s]  as i can get it i'm gonna give them an insane diving board that's not what i wanted to do
[12451.51s -> 12494.82s]  it's okay whatever i mean that's really dangerous oh how can i make this um this is big this is like
[12494.82s -> 12500.14s]  gonna be two or three hundred feet tall are they gonna be like get up here
[12504.63s -> 12513.82s]  the whole thing no i gotta change that angle they have to stay in the enclosure oh check this shit
[12513.82s -> 12545.90s]  out you guys are gonna lose your minds and you see this one why can you go this high
[12549.21s -> 12556.58s]  so instead of building a satellite why can i do this still i should be stopped shouldn't i be
[12556.58s -> 12601.14s]  stopped by now honestly why can i keep going is there a skybox oh shit
[12614.95s -> 12618.95s]  not rapture what was it called the other one the one that was high and not low
[12623.96s -> 12647.82s]  no you can't why is this allowed let's try turning it this way now check this shit already
[12648.46s -> 12658.92s]  there's gonna be a huge jump do you think we can make it just do a second zoo up here this is the
[12658.92s -> 12680.74s]  lemur portion all right i gotta make it so it's it's doable so it's right here and then that's
[12680.74s -> 12700.06s]  doable right and then they can get down all right this is gonna come back into the enclosure
[12701.27s -> 12713.08s]  wait where is where is their enclosure oh over there okay god i have to i have to look at this
[12713.08s -> 12729.80s]  from like a fucked up angle it's gotta go over here and then back this way because they need to
[12729.80s -> 12759.00s]  be able to jump down too okay i'm getting there oh can i make this longer no i have to look at it
[12759.00s -> 12773.37s]  from up so that's the only way this is gonna be possible oh man no it's not what if they go the
[12773.37s -> 12784.28s]  other way up they won't be able to i've already i thought about that plan already and down i have
[12784.28s -> 12791.70s]  to get on there we go okay good almost back in the enclosure how long is this this might be better
[12791.70s -> 12815.26s]  actually can i keep going up though unpause for a second what do you mean unpause for a second
[12816.30s -> 12849.40s]  oh it stands all right okay close this is a 90 degree drop oh not quite hold on i gotta go
[12850.28s -> 12860.14s]  that way i mean if i'm a lemur this is probably the coolest thing i've ever seen in my whole life
[12860.14s -> 12883.45s]  oops i mean they want to be up high all right that's good there we go can they make the jump
[12883.45s -> 12895.21s]  this is all i care about right now all right what about like from here i can't fucking believe it
[12895.21s -> 12906.09s]  can still go up i cannot believe this this i can't believe no this is unbelievable this shouldn't be
[12906.09s -> 12926.47s]  able to happen is this broken i don't think it's supposed to be like this i'm making getting over
[12926.47s -> 12944.46s]  it yeah yeah i am well i mean it is sandbox mode but this is ridiculous oh wait wait can i
[12944.46s -> 12979.69s]  put one of these all the way up here guys i've never seen anything like this before even if the
[12979.69s -> 12998.10s]  animal escapes how's how is a vet gonna get up here i think have to climb this we're still going
[12998.10s -> 13034.70s]  this is like the magic beanstalk okay i'm getting to the point where i'm not sure i'm gonna i want
[13034.70s -> 13043.64s]  to keep doing this we have to watch somebody go up here no lemur is not gonna go all the way up here
[13043.64s -> 13065.14s]  i think it's it that's it that's it that's it no it's not no it's not that's not it

[13987.88s -> 14015.72s]  some over here dig this down to the ground a little bit there all right we're good we're good
[14016.68s -> 14025.32s]  you guys what you want that's what you want what else you need climbable area um really you need a
[14025.32s -> 14034.58s]  climbable area sure what the fuck are you talking about all right we need short grass long grass
[14039.51s -> 14066.81s]  no less long grass and more soil wrong stick they can't climb that type no that's not true
[14066.81s -> 14081.37s]  don't even say that i don't believe that i really don't okay what else you guys want social space
[14081.37s -> 14094.36s]  whatever enrichment okay it's better than it was before wait javier the titan beetle has died
[14104.12s -> 14113.42s]  do you not see what's over here they don't just nothing they haven't seen it yet no climbable
[14113.42s -> 14126.41s]  platform climbable logs no these are climbable absolutely they are a new a new lemurs arrived
[14126.41s -> 14146.04s]  all right but get over there these are for leopards what no it's because it's raining out
[14146.04s -> 14163.74s]  right now that's the problem go on something i think somebody just had it okay hold on move
[14164.38s -> 14180.41s]  what do you mean delivery schedule that's the room over there all right look what's right next to you
[14184.14s -> 14190.94s]  look at that do you see it it's right here it's climbable and it's cool you have to try it
[14191.58s -> 14206.94s]  i'm looking at it come on come on throw them into the tower they're not going to work
[14207.66s -> 14216.79s]  what if i go like this hold on hold on okay i have an idea i have an idea everybody hold on
[14223.90s -> 14249.32s]  climbable right you know i'm saying how are you doing on enrichment what are we talking about
[14255.14s -> 14262.98s]  oh you shit that's a lot of people i just want you to climb this how do you not know how to climb
[14262.98s -> 14295.21s]  this toy enrichment it's right here climb it oh shit i locked him in the wood
[14301.70s -> 14310.06s]  why won't you climb these god damn it no somebody's gonna jump on it right
[14310.70s -> 14326.01s]  are they not old enough can they not climb yet is it like a research thing get leopards
[14326.97s -> 14353.13s]  climbable see but it might be this i think this is fucking everything up come on somebody get on
[14353.13s -> 14367.93s]  there filter the climbable logs by species yeah they can climb these i think it just went too
[14367.93s -> 14384.95s]  high and it's all fucked up uh i mean this is not even part of an enclosure i'm just waiting for
[14384.95s -> 14400.23s]  one of them to accidentally jump on it though enrichment come on god damn it no come on get on
[14400.23s -> 14465.08s]  these it's outside the fence if that's what it is it could be right so so what do i need to go to
[14465.08s -> 14482.92s]  like out oh man no i spent so much time on that it has to work once it has to work one time
[14482.92s -> 14491.18s]  i'm just trying to keep it i'm trying to make it so the when it goes up it stays in the enclosure
[14491.18s -> 14511.29s]  maybe if i go across this way it'll do it it'll do it i mean is that in it looks like it's out
[14511.29s -> 14520.82s]  right here it's got to be like the whole park it's saved it's saved the game is saved it's
[14520.82s -> 14552.18s]  saved it's saved don't worry it's saved i need to see if this works no if the game is saved the
[14552.18s -> 14575.19s]  game saved don't worry how do i get rid of an animal how do i get rid of an animal just leave
[14575.19s -> 14580.97s]  it and forget it but i need this to come out i need to see if this works i need to get these
[14580.97s -> 14588.09s]  alligators to go for a minute just get out of the way the game crashed i mean whatever for the best
[14594.14s -> 14603.26s]  no oh the lemur pole come on maybe if i load it back it'll be all right that's that's a good
[14603.26s -> 14613.86s]  idea i want to see them climb the tower i want to see them climb tower too you know what i mean the
[14613.86s -> 14624.14s]  thing i was just trying to say just move a lemur up there i don't think i can why is my planet
[14624.14s -> 14643.96s]  coaster isn't turning on anymore what is what this new steam sucks new steam is like battle net
[14644.52s -> 14658.57s]  all right here it comes or maybe not maybe it'll uh maybe it will never open up again
[14658.57s -> 14665.06s]  i'm so sad right now i really thought we were going to see the ultimate lemur feet of strength
[14665.78s -> 14672.52s]  make a new tower from scratch with lemurs in so you can make sure it works
[14672.52s -> 14686.33s]  fuck but fuck fuck right like that sucks if that's what i gotta do but that sucks i gotta
[14686.33s -> 14692.92s]  pee too i haven't gone to the bathroom i should have did that from the start but i got i got super
[14692.92s -> 14716.26s]  into it okay where's my uh was it roach ranch did i save it before the tower
[14717.14s -> 14730.25s]  this looks correct okay so here's what i have to do everybody's gonna be really we're gonna be
[14730.25s -> 14742.52s]  this is sad serious injury discovered he's the animal all right all right all right all right
[14742.52s -> 14754.15s]  load game load load load load load zoo it was tower yes it was this one so i'm going to
[14755.61s -> 14769.19s]  just i'm gonna delete the tower oh but look at how cool this is beach ball fell off no
[14770.07s -> 14778.71s]  this is so sad it really is but it's terrifying it's terrible but i have to do this i'm sorry

[14824.49s -> 14834.94s]  blueprint a tower can i do though all right here we go i'm gonna put some lemurs in here let's get
[14835.02s -> 14854.82s]  one in here uh let's go for it animal trading it's okay ring-tailed lemur invalid dedicated
[14854.82s -> 14863.13s]  to the door i remember this part and you know that's it i edit this whole barrier this is wrong too
[14863.13s -> 14883.70s]  this is electric fence all right this is going to be what is it about wood just concrete concrete
[14884.66s -> 14894.66s]  glass okay good done so now this is this is normal now this is not
[14894.66s -> 14899.32s]  fucked up let's get a lemur in here let's get a door on here first please

[15268.50s -> 15280.54s]  slowly work on their habitat what happened to the tree house uh it was a waste of time because they
[15280.70s -> 15290.46s]  wouldn't climb it because i broke the game but now okay here we go in richmond it may have been the
[15290.46s -> 15300.70s]  food on top too i don't know let's do uh let's pause it okay habitat this is we're looking for
[15300.70s -> 15311.18s]  a ring-tailed lemur cool uh let's we got a feeding a little feeding zone over here
[15312.42s -> 15326.06s]  over by the inevitable tower cool let's put like two of them and then let's do um water you know
[15326.06s -> 15336.63s]  some water bowls okay we'll get the feeding stations water stations uh their welfare let's
[15336.63s -> 15359.26s]  take a look there so we want some uh africa tropical tropical africa cool okay and we're
[15359.26s -> 15373.64s]  gonna slowly do this correctly that looks nice a little tree coming in from there nice cool all
[15373.64s -> 15395.37s]  right we'll put one of these over here i'm just trying to do this correct some bushes bushes over
[15395.37s -> 15415.03s]  here almost there more coverage some of the bigger ones okay nice let's do one more here
[15417.13s -> 15425.85s]  now your terrain shelter space is critically insufficient terrain is wrong it's grass and
[15425.85s -> 15440.55s]  soil so we need a shitload of soil soil light make this huge and just do the whole damn thing
[15441.19s -> 15465.67s]  okay good short grass perfect shelter where is your shelter here it is a basic shelter
[15469.85s -> 15498.58s]  very nice place to sleep what's wrong with this what's wrong with this why is it still zero
[15502.90s -> 15530.36s]  how's that zero they want privacy where's this lemur where are you okay now habitat's fine okay
[15531.32s -> 15540.28s]  enrichment yeah that's fine okay enrichment here we go i'm gonna start right here
[15541.32s -> 15553.00s]  let's see if this does anything pause it climbing climbable log climbable log
[15553.72s -> 15563.08s]  where's the 10 foot one two meters this is one six meters here we go does it show up
[15563.72s -> 15607.00s]  no why why is this doesn't why does it not work this is for it's not a little ring-tailed lemur
[15607.08s -> 15647.91s]  look so what the fuck climb it all right so climb it climbing isn't enrichment well you're good
[15647.91s -> 15663.29s]  to go okay so hold on it's it's probably because it's raining it's definitely because it's raining

[15903.24s -> 15912.60s]  let's get it right fucking in front of you here we go why did this turn away all right this has
[15912.60s -> 15937.35s]  to be perfect how can i get this to be perfect angle snap yep i gotta make sure this is going
[15937.35s -> 15948.97s]  in a straight line up this actually not gonna be too bad i can do two at a time
[15949.29s -> 15968.76s]  um free to time actually this is gonna take way less time is it leaning no it's not i can fix it
[15968.76s -> 15972.28s]  is it leaning no it's not is it leaning is it leaning i can't tell are you lying to me
[15973.48s -> 15987.88s]  no it's not leaning it's fine i had it too shouldn't have listened okay i gotta get like
[15987.88s -> 16015.67s]  this is where it gets hard somebody's gonna do this i guarantee it wait see if that it actually
[16015.67s -> 16031.11s]  climbs it um good idea did it go up did it go up i can't see is it dark like it's too dark i can't
[16031.11s -> 16043.77s]  see did it go up it's so dark out right now i i don't know where he is why is the zoo open at

[16074.63s -> 16098.15s]  a complete waste of my time any more lemurs in here come on get up there please i just need you
[16098.15s -> 16102.25s]  to climb it they're not dead they're fine they're over here playing around
[16103.05s -> 16120.49s]  oh it looked like you were going over to it they need incentive it's not gonna be leopards are not
[16120.49s -> 16146.62s]  gonna climb it fuck i'm so disappointed make some platforms i'll try that one climbed up earlier
[16146.62s -> 16152.78s]  yeah i know that's why it's like it's definitely possible now let's do some platforms climbable
[16152.86s -> 16163.98s]  ramp or a climbable platform because somebody get over here and just climb that and like
[16163.98s -> 16172.84s]  go from here to here and there to there right somebody just do it it's raining again no it
[16172.84s -> 16188.39s]  ain't raining again because i say so how do i turn this off all right i'm giving this like
[16188.39s -> 16202.22s]  30 to 40 more seconds and then i'm moving on get right all this shit oh this is possible
[16202.86s -> 16207.45s]  thinking about it thinking about it thinking about it thinking about it where are you going
[16212.52s -> 16223.91s]  no do that over here over this way you idiot why would the other lemurs so much more climbing
[16223.91s -> 16268.76s]  they climbed they climb so where do you go what the animals are all died well this is
[16268.76s -> 16273.64s]  all right i'm done and then i tried to make the tower and none of them want to climb it they
[16273.64s -> 16278.60s]  don't want even go over here we had lemurs in the last game and all they did was jump around in
[16278.60s -> 16288.42s]  circles all right back to the real game it's so disappointing when you try to do something
[16288.42s -> 16307.56s]  like that it just fucking doesn't play out it's disappointing it's a zoo not a circus i know
[16309.27s -> 16313.83s]  all right i'm still doing lemurs oh fuck i forgot it was here still
[16317.05s -> 16326.25s]  somebody climb it please climb it i need you to climb it please all right hold on
[16326.25s -> 16336.74s]  there's a diseased animal we have a vet right all right i gotta check around and make sure
[16336.74s -> 16344.42s]  everything's all right let's take a look at the animal list what's going on here all right all
[16344.42s -> 16353.24s]  the all the bugs are in bad shape it's because they all hate the environment i know well i'm
[16353.24s -> 16362.54s]  gonna release half of them into the wild so who cares it's this one they don't like to be together
[16363.50s -> 16371.00s]  there are too many giant cockroaches in here so i'm gonna get rid of them
[16371.64s -> 16379.06s]  what beetle diet dude that one's fine all right yeah i'm gonna get in here and i'm gonna delete
[16379.06s -> 16404.87s]  half these beetles okay release to the wild wait did i just let them out of the cage is that all
[16404.87s -> 16411.26s]  i did all right there's still a problem socially in here why how many are in here
[16416.22s -> 16417.26s]  there's so many in there
[16417.26s -> 16436.65s]  15 15 15 15 all right we'll keep like two in here better all right now we're good back here
[16439.10s -> 16445.14s]  uh everyone else is okay everyone's happy a beetle did just die what is that well i was
[16445.14s -> 16460.66s]  smoking what's going on call mechanic over here please the person had 10 umbrellas

[16483.16s -> 16488.20s]  this is this is the lemur place and it's all it's just too it's too much i'm going to keep this
[16488.76s -> 16492.04s]  in the very rare event that the lemurs actually give a shit and do something with it so we're
[16492.04s -> 16497.48s]  going to do an actual lemur in enclosure we're going to delete this business electric fence still
[16498.20s -> 16504.25s]  okay this can't be electrical do leopards instead or with chimps
[16506.49s -> 16512.68s]  what's the hold on wait we're like an orangutan climb that

[16559.94s -> 16578.20s]  it's not so huge it's gonna be a chimpanzee enclosure maybe even a little bit smaller from
[16578.20s -> 16604.46s]  like here to here that's good make the walls bigger i'm gonna select everything up like i
[16604.46s -> 16612.52s]  don't know five feet 10 feet whatever five meters that's fine chip is gonna just break through the

[16629.27s -> 16641.90s]  that's not possible so sorry okay now uh we need some can chimpanzees climb that
[16641.90s -> 16663.94s]  let's just check it this is for a chimpanzee western chimpanzee okay they can climb this
[16663.94s -> 16667.30s]  okay okay it's possible
[16673.38s -> 16681.85s]  reinforced concrete what thing climbs the most out of anything in the whole game bonobo bonobos
[16683.40s -> 16703.80s]  reinforced concrete okay good so now i need bonobo make the habitat small so i don't have
[16703.80s -> 16720.62s]  anywhere else to go this is fine okay you see a bonobo please work i'm like gonna lose my mind

[17378.41s -> 17383.69s]  you want climbable area i've already got a shitload of it but apparently that doesn't matter
[17384.33s -> 17399.98s]  all right so we don't we need grass and soil they don't like long grass so we don't want short grass

[27142.58s -> 27153.24s]  for the 250 hey what's been the greatest day of your life ever so far um that's tough greatest
[27153.24s -> 27166.46s]  day of my life ever as i don't know hmm i don't i can't answer that there's been too many things
[27166.46s -> 27175.93s]  that it could have been that you know what probably probably when i got the message
[27176.57s -> 27183.98s]  from and now this guy this company like sucks okay i know but when i like got my you are
[27183.98s -> 27191.18s]  partnered from machinima message like eight years ago that was like holy shit this is the
[27191.18s -> 27194.62s]  greatest thing this is the greatest day of my life i was like wow this is fucking awesome
[27197.93s -> 27211.18s]  i was like that was like pretty cool that was a big deal that's what a shitty life no no no no no
[27211.18s -> 27217.83s]  you gotta remember i'm talking about like eight and that like eight and a half years ago because
[27217.83s -> 27225.46s]  like the youtube ad program and making money on ads on youtube that that like started just barely
[27225.46s -> 27233.32s]  like seven and a half eight and a half years ago they never used to be like that so essentially i
[27233.32s -> 27238.76s]  was being told hey uh the views on your on your videos are now going to make money it was the
[27238.76s -> 27247.51s]  first time it had ever been a thing so it was like what the fuck are you serious and then that
[27247.51s -> 27251.43s]  company made a series of some of the worst business decisions you probably could ever make in your
[27251.43s -> 27255.51s]  whole life and like they went through like four ceos and turns out one of the ceos i think went
[27255.51s -> 27272.09s]  to jail and uh the whole company got liquidated so okay turn turn the clock forward 10 years
[27272.17s -> 27289.54s]  happy ending but that was a different time period on youtube it really was just nobody knew anything
[27289.54s -> 27295.94s]  nobody knew what the hell they were doing there was no formula it was just you just did whatever
[27302.71s -> 27308.78s]  but the golden age of youtube i don't know if i would call that the golden age of youtube i
[27308.78s -> 27316.46s]  would call probably you know here stamp this i would say like 2013 like 2012 to like you know
[27316.46s -> 27324.46s]  2013 to like 2015 that like two year span of like two or three years was i think the best uh the
[27324.46s -> 27337.18s]  most fun i ever had on youtube between like 2012 and like 2014 2015 a two year span of two to three
[27337.18s -> 27347.82s]  years yeah that's exactly yeah 2013 especially i think it was i was having the most fun ever
[27348.54s -> 27353.42s]  you talk about oh what's like the greatest day ever i don't know when when castle griffinstein
[27353.42s -> 27365.77s]  got uploaded that was just i just loved every second of what i was doing i'm serious but we
[27365.77s -> 27377.96s]  could reminisce all day german rumble live too but that was also that was kind of at the tail end
[27377.96s -> 27388.79s]  though and then they made all kinds of ad friendly decisions and changing the way the site works and
[27388.79s -> 27395.51s]  what constitutes a view and what constitutes engagement and then what happened is he started
[27395.51s -> 27400.63s]  having people just feed into engagement and it wasn't about getting clicks anymore is about
[27400.63s -> 27407.43s]  making people stay and watch and watch a bunch of ads and mid rolls and then i was it was kind of
[27407.43s -> 27426.55s]  like i don't i'm i'm kind of done he hates youtube no that's not true it just things changed a little
[27426.55s -> 27437.93s]  and i was kind of just over it so here we are now but we only have a few more left to do uh snoozing
[27437.93s -> 27441.93s]  copter thanks for the 250 i linked this video once but i don't remember when and you had a really
[27442.01s -> 27448.10s]  funny reaction so i hope to recreate that now also streaming planet zoo was my wish for today
[27448.66s -> 27453.21s]  there you go i told the pre-chat to tell you to play it if it wasn't there so i'm glad this

[27489.42s -> 27496.30s]  i'm not going from twitch to mixer if i started on twitch maybe i would move to mixer maybe maybe
[27496.30s -> 27503.30s]  if that was the only time i'd moved but i took an established audience on youtube and said all right
[27503.30s -> 27509.80s]  go here now and took a while for you know that whole thing to play out and for years to go by
[27509.80s -> 27514.36s]  all right well let's do it again i'm moving another mixer this time and everyone has to move again

[27871.59s -> 27880.97s]  and both of them just leave so and then you just have nothing you just keep going back and forth
[27880.97s -> 27891.58s]  until you just lose it all that's like continuing to bet at like the roulette table just keep
[27891.58s -> 27895.58s]  putting down a hundred dollars and if you just keep winning over and over again and keep doubling
