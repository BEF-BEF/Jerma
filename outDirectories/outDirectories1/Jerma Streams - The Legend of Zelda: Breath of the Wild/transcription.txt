[58.17s -> 69.70s]  How you doing? Welcome back to a stream. I'll be doing good. I'll be doing well. Pretty cool.
[70.58s -> 79.99s]  We're back on Sunday for some more Omega Gaming Weekend. I told you I thought maybe I'd be here
[79.99s -> 90.22s]  on Monday or Sunday maybe. I don't know. You missed the last stream. It was a 14 hour stream.
[91.90s -> 99.74s]  Went all the way into Saturday. Now here we are on Sunday to do some more of what I would,
[99.74s -> 103.82s]  what I've coined, you know, trademarks and stuff like that trying to figure it out.
[104.70s -> 116.73s]  Omega Gaming Weekend. So yeah, that's really cool. He's keeping promises kept. He's keeping his
[116.73s -> 128.55s]  promises. I was actually in here at the pre-stream and had the suss changed to Monday and I was like,
[128.55s -> 136.92s]  no, no, I'm just kidding. I'm doing today. I mean, a lot of people that got, you know,
[136.92s -> 140.76s]  they made Omega Gaming Weekend t-shirts were a little annoyed when I made it on Monday.
[144.02s -> 150.55s]  But yeah, today we're going to be doing Breath of the Wild. I'm going in here with a completely
[150.55s -> 157.91s]  open mind. I am not going to say anything about a Brom software game that I may have played
[157.91s -> 165.53s]  recently, six months ago, whatever. I've never played Breath of the Wild. I don't know. All I
[165.53s -> 173.91s]  know about, this is all I know. All I know is it's an open world Zelda game where your weapons break.
[174.63s -> 182.07s]  That's it. I don't know anything else. So if you're going to be a backseat Barry today,
[182.47s -> 190.36s]  keep in mind, I have no idea what you're even referring to. If I need help, I'll ask for it,
[190.36s -> 207.42s]  or I might just look over a chat and just see the answer. Backseat Barrys, yeah. Malled incoming.
[207.42s -> 220.22s]  Can you even mauled? Can you mauled in a Zelda game? Is that even possible? I don't, okay. Let's
[220.22s -> 230.47s]  also talk about this real quick. The last Zelda game that I opened was Chlorine Eyes Princess.
[231.11s -> 241.03s]  That's the last one I played. Twilight Princess. Sorry, that's what it was. Twilight Princess.
[243.96s -> 247.48s]  Sorry, I got it wrong. Yeah, Twilight Princess is the last one that I played,
[247.48s -> 255.91s]  and I stopped after the first three hours. I hate the way that game looks. That whole game looks
[255.91s -> 260.15s]  like you opened your eyes in a pool and then looked at light and shit. It's Chlorine Eyes.
[260.15s -> 273.11s]  That whole game is Chlorine Eyes. I cannot play it. All the bloom. There's so much weird bloom,
[273.67s -> 279.88s]  chlorine bloom, but that's a lot. And I didn't play anything else after that.
[279.88s -> 284.44s]  And I've never played Wind Waker. The only thing I know about Wind Waker is
[288.60s -> 302.09s]  and there's a boat on the screen. I don't know anything else. Play that too. You would like it,
[302.09s -> 305.61s]  but I don't really play Zelda. I'm telling you, I just don't really play Zelda games.
[305.61s -> 310.65s]  Let's see if my opinion will change. Let's find out. I'm ready to go right now.
[311.37s -> 322.95s]  Did I tweet? It's so good. I know it's so good. Okay, what's better? One's in the chat if Breath
[322.95s -> 328.71s]  of the Wild is better. Two in the chat if Wind Waker is better. What's better? What should I be
[328.71s -> 338.10s]  playing right now? If you had a choice right now, if the genie showed up and said, I will change it
[338.10s -> 354.70s]  to whatever. I will make him play Wind Waker right now. What a stupid wish. What a bad wish.
[356.81s -> 363.34s]  The genie is here. I will do whatever you ask. You have free wishes. Hey, this 37 year old man
[363.34s -> 370.33s]  child on the internet. Can you make him play Wind Waker, please? Yeah, Wind Waker. That's the one.
[371.05s -> 386.04s]  Make him do it. No, excuse me. I'm, I'm, I'm a man. I'm just, I'm a man. Sorry, I'm a man.
[393.10s -> 403.54s]  No, I'm not. No, I'm not. I'm a man. Okay, I just looked down and I'm hoping that I could. Okay,
[403.54s -> 415.10s]  so I don't, I don't have a Star Wars shirt on. I picked, I almost did. I looked down. I thought
[415.10s -> 434.20s]  I had a Star Wars shirt on. Not today. We're just standard default adult gray. Sorry, nothing on it.
[434.20s -> 438.90s]  Villain hair? Yeah, maybe a little. I, I, we gotta test something here because the way that you
[438.90s -> 447.29s]  capture, you know, I'm living with, I'm using technology from like 2013 still. And I know,
[447.29s -> 450.73s]  dude, just get like a professional capture card. I, it's never going to happen because that
[450.73s -> 455.54s]  requires me to have to go get like actually get one, but we need to do this. You ready?
[455.54s -> 459.62s]  And I was like, just get it on Amazon. But every time I do an Amazon order for anything,
[459.62s -> 463.86s]  I always, I think of like, okay, what do I want? And then two or three important things,
[463.86s -> 472.09s]  just never make it to the list ever. Uh, okay. So you got to tell me if this is matching up
[472.09s -> 481.32s]  both webcam, audio, and on the screen. You ready? So tell me there's a delay. Go options,
[481.32s -> 490.10s]  ability controls. One, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three.
[490.10s -> 497.70s]  We good? So that means I got it right. All right. I got it right. You guys ready? Are you pumped?
[500.74s -> 509.18s]  This is a Sunday of Omega Gaming Weekend. All right. So this is the, I, I, yeah, I opened it
[509.18s -> 514.14s]  and I, I didn't watch the opening cuts thing because I don't care. So let's go. It was onto
[514.14s -> 521.24s]  the background. I was like, I had, I was going like this. Nice frames. What do you mean nice frames?
[521.24s -> 529.34s]  Is this game 30 FPS? Do I have something wrong? There's a bingo card going. I don't even want
[529.34s -> 552.46s]  to see it. It's 30 FPS. Wait, what are you saying? This game is 30 FPS? Hey, Bloodborne's one of my
[552.46s -> 561.51s]  favorite games ever made. And that's 30 FPS. So quiet. I need two headphones with this shit.
[561.51s -> 569.86s]  There's no LPs. It will help guide you after your long slumber. That is a Sheikah Slate. Take it.
[569.86s -> 580.49s]  It will help you with the classic sound effects in it too. Oh, he's got it. Is that a Wii U?
[580.49s -> 585.48s]  Was this a Wii U game? What does it come out for? A mysterious tablet with a glowing center. You've
[585.48s -> 593.18s]  never seen this device before, and yet there's something familiar about it. Are there annoying
[593.18s -> 599.11s]  puzzles in this game? No, this is, this was on, this wasn't Wii U. This was a Switch release, right?
[611.58s -> 618.81s]  These all, all treasures? Wait, the chests? Well-worn trousers. These old trousers are
[618.81s -> 623.21s]  red bear in spots, but they're surprisingly comfortable. The legs are a bit too short though.
[623.21s -> 637.48s]  Okay. This gear? Okay. Nice. So what is that like Hearthstone card pack that I have for my,
[637.48s -> 646.44s]  what is that? Is that like the, the slate? All right. I got pants. I was even never played this
[646.44s -> 651.32s]  before. I don't play Zelda. I, I actually, this is the first Zelda game I played in probably
[651.32s -> 665.08s]  15 years. Ooh, shirt. You can pick, wait, you can pick stuff up. Particle effects. Pretty good.
[665.08s -> 680.23s]  It's got physics. Pretty good. Do naked no armor run. Is this kind of like, um, all right, should
[680.23s -> 687.83s]  we make a, make a running counter of, try to do this without mentioning any From Software game?
[687.83s -> 693.90s]  How? I don't think I can do that.
[694.84s -> 701.16s]  That will show you the way. Don't ask chat for advice. LOL. The game is self-explanatory.
[701.16s -> 718.42s]  Okay. I'm not, I'm not looking over here. So that's how you, it's a key. I didn't make the title,
[718.42s -> 731.11s]  one of the mods did. It's pretty good though. I can't, I don't think I can delete it. No intro?
[731.11s -> 736.87s]  Um, well, I already saw it. It was, uh, did the thing that video games challenge.
[736.87s -> 746.31s]  You are the light, our light, that must shine upon Hyrule once again. Now go.
[751.69s -> 758.31s]  Uh, it did the thing that video games like to do where, and I hate this. I want a menu before
[758.31s -> 764.39s]  anything happens. Anything. I don't want an opening cut scene. I don't want a get into the game and
[764.39s -> 772.90s]  here's the tutorial, but you can't access the menu. I give me the menu immediately. Immediately.
[772.90s -> 777.94s]  Once I do my settings, it pops up, should call it, come up and be like, hey, do you give a shit
[777.94s -> 782.10s]  about doing your settings? Just hit B if you don't care. And then whatever, you can do that whole
[782.10s -> 788.58s]  thing out. But I want to change the gamma. I want to change the, uh, field of view. I want to change
[788.58s -> 797.91s]  the audio levels. I don't want to just see the opening cut scene. God, if I made a game, God,
[797.91s -> 802.50s]  it would be the best game ever made. It would sell a hundred fucking billion copies. It would be so
[802.50s -> 806.02s]  good. That would, yeah, that would be each person would, would, would own 10 copies of my game.
[806.02s -> 818.78s]  It's just so goddamn good. Jump is X. That's kind of weird. All right. B is sprint. I don't like
[818.78s -> 830.66s]  that. I want it to be, I want B to be jump. Okay. Hold on a second. This is a switch controller. I
[830.66s -> 845.10s]  forgot. I'll fix it in a minute because this is a grip meter. Wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on.
[858.30s -> 887.30s]  Wow. Okay. No, I'm not going to say it. I won't. Okay. If I make 10 Elden Ring references this
[887.30s -> 896.74s]  stream, then I have to eat a bug on camera. I'm not doing that. Do you guys remember the old fear
[896.74s -> 908.42s]  factor fucking whatever they were videos? What was going on? I can't even stand it eating fucking
[908.42s -> 916.36s]  like live insects. Like what the fuck? What are we doing? It was horrible. I couldn't take it.
[916.36s -> 927.21s]  Okay. Wooden branches such as these are pretty common. All right. Wait, I have a branch for a
[927.21s -> 938.98s]  weapon. Okay. Attack with your weapon. All right. That's kind of cool. Can I use the branch for the
[938.98s -> 953.90s]  whole game? Yeah, this is all fucked up. This is all fucked up. Hold on a second. Change jump button
[953.98s -> 965.62s]  on. Wait, what? Oh, there we go. So now where, what is sprint? Sprint is X.
[969.29s -> 982.84s]  I think that's all right. Wait, I broke it already? I didn't even touch anything. Why is it already
[982.84s -> 1000.38s]  broken? Mushrooms. Okay. You can eat these. You smashed it. What? Did I already ruin something?
[1000.38s -> 1029.11s]  You're covering the map. Oh, I'll go like this then. Better. That's throw. Who needs a weapon? Fuck it.
[1029.11s -> 1036.97s]  How do you get another weapon? I don't actually need that, right? It's a...
[1042.39s -> 1053.66s]  Where's, where's that? Oh, okay. Oh, all right. And you can stamp too. Okay, cool. So I gotta go this
[1053.66s -> 1067.93s]  way. Cool. All right. Follow the Sheikah Slate. Baked apple. Beg your pardon. I do believe that is
[1067.93s -> 1072.49s]  my baked apple. You can't just go around taking whatever you please. Oh, forgive me. I could not
[1072.49s -> 1077.53s]  resist pulling your leg. Please help yourself. An apple a day keeps the doctor away, as they say,
[1077.53s -> 1085.67s]  don't they like? It's a succulent treat. Where are you? Me? I'm Ganondorf. You see, I'm gonna have a
[1085.67s -> 1089.51s]  fucking big Santa Claus beard on for the whole game and then I'm gonna take it off and at the end
[1089.51s -> 1095.91s]  you're gonna be fighting me as Ganon. I win. I'm just an old fool who's lived here alone for quite
[1095.91s -> 1103.85s]  some time. I'm not Ganondorf. Don't worry. What brings a bright-eyed young man here?
[1103.85s -> 1110.01s]  Answering a question with a question. That is fair enough. As I cannot imagine our reading to be a
[1110.01s -> 1114.95s]  simple coincidence, I shall tell you this is the Great Plateau. According to legend, this is the
[1114.95s -> 1125.18s]  birthplace of the entire Kingdom of Hyrule. Why do I look like this? Why did I read that? Of the
[1125.26s -> 1129.32s]  five million comments that were just coming through. Okay, cool. This is the birthplace of
[1129.32s -> 1142.42s]  Hyrule. That's, no, it's gonna say Ganon's dad. He's his fucking Gondondorf. That temple there,
[1142.42s -> 1147.35s]  long ago, was the site of many sacred ceremonies. Ever since the decline of the kingdom a hundred
[1147.35s -> 1154.70s]  years ago, it has set abandoned in a state of decay. Yet another forgotten entity, a mere ghost
[1154.70s -> 1169.82s]  of its former self. Interesting. That's right. That'll be, that'll be five hundred dollars,
[1169.82s -> 1173.50s]  because that was a cool magic trick and I didn't even ask you, I didn't even ask you for money.
[1173.50s -> 1183.32s]  That'll be a thousand dollars, please, for that kind of personal show. Oh, cool. Well,
[1183.32s -> 1187.14s]  then just help yourself to that torch there and how may I ask you planning to use it?
[1187.14s -> 1193.59s]  Um, it's a secret. To set things on fire, it's rather unnerving. Please be cautious with that
[1193.59s -> 1198.66s]  around any dry grass. You know, there are plenty of monsters in this area. That torch would make a
[1198.66s -> 1203.05s]  good weapon if need be. Don't just swing it around without purpose. You must face your opponents and
[1203.05s -> 1218.94s]  lock your sights on them. Yeah, right, obviously. Okay, I'm just testing it. Do I have to light it?
[1218.94s -> 1229.94s]  How do I light the torch? Okay, got it. Now what? Let's go. I'm holding this as if I don't know
[1229.94s -> 1236.10s]  what to do with this, right? This is like, this is like I don't know what to do with this item.
[1236.74s -> 1246.95s]  Wait, is this an axe? Woodcutter's axe. Oh, shit, cool. No, I don't want to put that on.
[1246.95s -> 1272.74s]  Change weapon. Press and hold and then switch. This is a camera? How do I zoom out? Did I just
[1272.74s -> 1286.62s]  take a picture? Okay. Um, I got to go that way. How do I switch? It said hold what? How do I
[1286.62s -> 1296.15s]  switch weapons? I said hold this and then press. Oh, okay, there it is. Yeah. All right, I'm ready.
[1296.15s -> 1309.02s]  Let's move. Acorn. So you just wait. You just eat nuts and seeds and shit. 20 rupees under there.
[1318.76s -> 1349.53s]  Okay, cool. Let's move. I got him. Oh, is there a dodge roll? What the fuck? Is there a dodge roll?
[1357.05s -> 1368.58s]  Okay, got him. Is it jump? Bokoblin fang. Cook it alongside a critter to make it an elixir.
[1369.14s -> 1379.14s]  Wait, I cook their teeth? Okay, cool. Wasting durability on weak enemies. What do you mean
[1379.14s -> 1393.56s]  wasting durability? I don't know what that- what do you mean? How do I go to the- I mean wasting
[1393.56s -> 1399.19s]  durability. How can I see how much durability this has? Should I use the stick or something for now?
[1403.96s -> 1427.51s]  Wait, search. Ancient spring. Okay, cool. I get some more sticks? How do you block? Can I punch?
[1427.51s -> 1454.70s]  Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Oh, he dropped a turkey leg. How long does it take to
[1454.70s -> 1461.26s]  break stuff? Should I actually not be using this? Look at this. This thing's sick. I'm gonna hold
[1461.26s -> 1468.58s]  onto the turkey leg. It depends. It doesn't take long. Is there a durability menu? Can I see which
[1468.58s -> 1473.08s]  one is low and high? Don't even- who cares? Don't even worry about it. All right, I'm just gonna
[1473.08s -> 1488.65s]  keep the axe on. How come the title says horsies, by the way? Is there a horse? Can you climb this?
[1501.27s -> 1524.38s]  I found a bird up here. Oh, I'm just stealing the eggs. He found his way. I mean, if this is- this
[1524.46s -> 1542.63s]  is just- hey, all right. So, I'm gonna push that over here and kill these guys. What happens when
[1542.63s -> 1559.98s]  you die? What was the last- what? What was the last save? Why did I just explode? They- do I still
[1559.98s -> 1564.54s]  have everything? No, I'm good. I'm good. Okay, that was fine. So, wait, this is my- do you have to
[1564.54s -> 1610.22s]  pick your body up? Hey, come get me. How do I- can I get their attention? I got hit by that, too.
[1612.62s -> 1631.32s]  How did I get hit by that? Oh, a cooked turkey! Pick up souls? Where are they? I don't see them
[1631.32s -> 1656.65s]  anywhere. Are they actually on the ground? There's an X on the screen. Dude, I actually don't like it
[1656.65s -> 1662.94s]  like that. The sprint really needs to be- but no, it sucks that way. I don't like it like that.
[1662.94s -> 1674.26s]  I'll keep it the other way. I'll have to get used to it. Why can't I just map it? Okay, that's really
[1674.26s -> 1679.46s]  funny to me that there's a change the jump button rebind, but it just makes it a different one that
[1679.46s -> 1685.85s]  you can't determine what you want to do. You want to remap jump? Well, you can only make it this
[1685.85s -> 1712.65s]  other one button. Okay, let's go. Get a better PC. Ooh, okay, that's cool. What's this? I got a bow?
[1713.21s -> 1730.07s]  Okay, right trigger is bow. How do I fire? Is he throwing fucking rocks? All right,
[1730.07s -> 1738.78s]  there's tons of shit here. Oh, I didn't have any arrows. Arrows, horn. Very cool. All right.
[1738.78s -> 1765.16s]  Should I eat an apple or eat something? Tasty. No arrow, Andy. Good one, thanks. I appreciate it.
[1765.16s -> 1772.86s]  I was hoping at least one of you would care. Wait, hidden cave? No, I'm supposed to go here.
[1772.86s -> 1791.66s]  Okay, so cool. So this is the first little area. This is my first dungeon? First dungeon? Link,
[1791.66s -> 1801.00s]  it's a rectangle the size of the device. Just put it in. You can rebind in the actual menu.
[1801.00s -> 1861.18s]  Really? You can? That pig default noise. Oh shit. That's pretty, uh, that's pretty cool.
[1867.86s -> 1903.42s]  Great Plateau Tower. Distilling local information. Here it comes. Oh, it's nevermind. I'm not gonna
[1903.42s -> 1910.09s]  say it. I'm gonna have you guys keep track of the times I say it, but it is that thing
[1910.09s -> 1953.80s]  from that other game that I played. Why didn't anybody wake me up? Now then, you must hurry,
[1953.80s -> 1967.72s]  Link, before it's too late. He doesn't care? Why are you even saying that? Mirrored cam?
[1967.72s -> 1974.26s]  No, it's not a mirrored cam. All right, so now I opened up that, which that's, okay, that's the
[1974.26s -> 1978.78s]  very end of the game, right? I have to go there. I have to dip the axe into the mountain to get the
[1979.34s -> 1985.94s]  encrusted fucking, like, Dairy Queen cherry dip on the axe, right? And then I gotta go over here
[1985.94s -> 1990.82s]  on the left and I have to mold the handle out of clay. The hardest clay that was put in the kiln
[1990.82s -> 1998.17s]  up here in the mountain of the ovens and stuff. And then, yeah, I'll be there eventually. I'll be
[1998.17s -> 2003.69s]  there eventually. That's how it worked in the other ones, right? Like, you have to go get this part
[2003.69s -> 2009.21s]  from the sword and go get this from over here and get this sword. I haven't played Zelda in fucking
[2009.21s -> 2017.74s]  15 years. I have no idea how it works. Don't you, like, make the master sword in all these games?
[2017.74s -> 2022.74s]  Isn't that the whole point? I thought that's what the entire point of all these games was.
[2022.74s -> 2060.42s]  It's like, oh, you have to get the master sword. We got that out of the way. That's right. Okay,
[2060.42s -> 2081.96s]  how do I get down from here? Can I go faster than this? Can you, how do you climb faster?
[2081.96s -> 2106.55s]  Okay, this tower and others just like it have erupted across the land one after another.
[2106.55s -> 2112.70s]  It's almost as though a long dormant power has awoken quite suddenly. You do not mind me asking,
[2112.70s -> 2121.05s]  did anything odd occur while you were atop that tower? I'm revealing no information. I saw the
[2121.05s -> 2127.34s]  whole thing. You don't have to hide it from me. Well, why ask the question then? Although I could
[2127.34s -> 2132.06s]  not hear anything, I did see you react as if you heard something coming from the direction of the
[2132.06s -> 2146.30s]  castle. Okay. Did you recognize this voice? Let's see if you can go two for two. Seems to have some
[2146.30s -> 2152.81s]  work to do as far as earning your trust goes. I suppose that is understandable. I assume you
[2152.81s -> 2161.66s]  caught sight of that atrocity enshrouding the castle. That is calamity Ganon. 100 years ago,
[2161.66s -> 2170.86s]  that vile entity brought the kingdom of Hyrule to ruin. It appeared suddenly and destroyed
[2170.86s -> 2176.78s]  everything in its path. So many innocent lives were lost in its wake. For a century, the very
[2176.78s -> 2183.35s]  symbol of our kingdom, Hyrule Castle, has managed to contain that evil, but just barely. There it
[2183.35s -> 2187.59s]  festers, building its strength for the moment. It will unleash its blight upon the land once again.
[2187.59s -> 2202.46s]  It would appear that moment is fast approaching. Do you intend to make your way to the castle?
[2202.46s -> 2211.85s]  I do. Had a feeling you would say that. Here on this isolated plateau, we are surrounded on all
[2211.85s -> 2218.33s]  sides by steep cliffs with no way down. If you were to try to jump off, well, no death could be
[2218.33s -> 2224.47s]  more certain or more foolish. Of course, if you had a paraglider like mine, that would be another
[2224.47s -> 2230.95s]  story. Give me it. Certainly, why not? But there is no such thing as a free item in this world,
[2230.95s -> 2235.75s]  you know. Let's see now. How about I trade it for a bit of treasure that slumbers nearby?
[2235.75s -> 2253.42s]  So you get quests and stuff? Okay, cool. Yeah, let's track this one. Let me show you something.
[2253.42s -> 2278.25s]  I didn't know I think that. I was seeing... Okay, well, oops. I'm following you. You said,
[2278.25s -> 2288.47s]  follow me. I'm following you. You see that structure, the one shining with a strange light?
[2288.47s -> 2294.49s]  Yeah, it began glowing at the exact moment these towers rose up from the ground. It must be a
[2294.49s -> 2307.78s]  dungeon. Okay, I would think such a place might house some sort of treasure. All right, let's go.
[2307.78s -> 2321.05s]  Fair exchange for the paraglider. Oh, you can swim. Okay, cool. Does everything break or anything?
[2321.69s -> 2336.89s]  I just caught a fish in my mouth. What? I thought that was... Wait, hold on.
[2336.89s -> 2344.89s]  Oh, my God. I'm all right. I'm okay. I'll be all right. I just drowned in a three-foot deep
[2344.89s -> 2355.13s]  pool. I'm sorry. I thought that was just like, okay... I didn't know that was breath. I get it
[2355.13s -> 2361.29s]  now. I get it. I get it. I get it. I thought that was my stamina and then when it was empty,
[2361.29s -> 2375.21s]  I was going to start, I don't know, getting hurt or... I don't know. I didn't know. How was
[2375.21s -> 2427.06s]  I supposed to know? I'm going that way. 1240... Is that real time? This is pretty. I can't move
[2427.06s -> 2443.64s]  that rock. Treasure down here. Raid song? I mean, raid song. How do I open this? Oh, there's a raid.
[2443.64s -> 2448.17s]  Hey, the grapefruit. Thanks for the raid. Is there... That was a raid? That just happened?
[2448.73s -> 2453.37s]  I'm not going to fucking drown in here. I'm dead again. I'm dead. I'm actually going to die in this.
[2454.62s -> 2461.88s]  Oh, my God. Thank goodness. You can't swim to treasure. It's its own puzzle. Oh, okay. So,
[2461.88s -> 2479.98s]  let's figure that out. Do I have to drain the water? Power fire? Wait, I think I know what to do.
[2479.98s -> 2500.63s]  Can I shove this in and like, displace some water? I don't know. There's no lever to pull,
[2500.63s -> 2519.62s]  whatever. I can probably do it later. Okay, so here we go. Let's do it. Play the game?
[2520.10s -> 2531.64s]  How am I not playing the game? Access granted. This seems kind of fun. Maybe I will enjoy this.
[2531.64s -> 2550.04s]  Solving puzzles is a big part of the game. Don't let chat ruin it for you unless you're stuck.
[2550.04s -> 2567.22s]  Okay. To you, who sets foot in this shrine, I am Oman Ao. In the name of... Why did I want
[2567.22s -> 2594.90s]  to press A? Is this temperature? What? There's a degrees temperature? All right, let's do it.
[2594.90s -> 2608.84s]  It's engine oil temp. No help. No help. Play Disney Infinity 3.0. I tried to two days ago,
[2609.48s -> 2616.66s]  and it didn't work. I couldn't capture it and I could barely play it. They just, like I said,
[2616.66s -> 2622.34s]  they just dragged the console port folder over to Unity or something to make it just run. I don't
[2622.34s -> 2630.46s]  even know. I have no idea. It's one of those ports. Manipulate metallic objects using magnetism.
[2630.46s -> 2637.30s]  Grab onto metallic objects using the magnetic energy that pours forth from the magnesis ruin.
[2637.30s -> 2684.58s]  Okay, so I can control magnetic powers? That's kind of cool. Push. Oh, cool. So you've done those
[2684.58s -> 2745.19s]  special powers? All right, I got it. Is the treasure chest up there? Cool. Okay, I know how
[2745.19s -> 2776.18s]  to get that. Oh, I can't just pick it up? Oh, push. Okay. Can I make like a bridge? I guess not.
[2776.74s -> 2806.26s]  Maybe I can make a bridge. What happened? What the fuck was that? What was that? I snapped my neck.
[2806.26s -> 2824.84s]  Oh, I started at the very beginning. What? You slammed a metal slab directly into your face.
[2845.14s -> 2852.22s]  There's like a hop, isn't there? There's always a hop in the Zelda games. There's like a hop, hop,
[2852.22s -> 2873.75s]  hop. How do I do it? How do I do the hop? Ancient screw. No, it's not the jump. It's like a
[2874.87s -> 2879.66s]  they usually there's a bloodborne dash. You guys know what I'm talking about, right?
[2879.66s -> 2886.31s]  Doesn't he do like a backflip? There's like a flip, flip, flip. Is that just not in this game?
[2889.62s -> 2894.30s]  Hold, target, and jump. Yeah, but it's not doing it. You learn that later. Okay,
[2894.30s -> 2920.23s]  I wonder how close I am to actually getting that because I want it. I can probably jump up here.
[2920.23s -> 2952.25s]  I can't tilt this. Oh shit. Okay, cool. Oh, it's made out of metal. That's right. Traveller's bow.
[2952.25s -> 2985.78s]  All right, change bow. I'll keep this one on. All right, that's fun. What else? You seriously
[2985.78s -> 2998.23s]  suck at this game. Dude, I don't, I've just started playing it. You've proven to possess
[2998.23s -> 3008.92s]  the resolve of a true hero. I am Omen Ao, the creator of this trial. I am a humble monk,
[3008.92s -> 3012.92s]  blessed with the sight of goddess Hylia and dedicated to helping those who seek defeated
[3012.92s -> 3024.94s]  Ganon. With your arrival, my duty is now fulfilled. In the name of goddess Hylia, allow me to bestow
[3024.94s -> 3039.93s]  this gift upon you, the varnish for the master sword. Can't use it yet though. Spirit orb,
[3039.93s -> 3056.15s]  a symbol of courage given to those who have overcome the challenges of a shrine. So what is
[3056.63s -> 3061.21s]  it? Is it like a currency thing? And I mean that actually, not like the joke from like five years
[3061.21s -> 3088.47s]  ago. Cool. All right. So you beat, beat shrines, get currency, get money, get experience. It's a
[3088.47s -> 3100.68s]  soul coin. Ooh. I'll be really honest. To be able to come from that direction and land here,
[3101.24s -> 3107.34s]  you had to have jumped from like all the way up there. You know, you had to have left 20 minutes
[3107.34s -> 3114.78s]  ago and started gliding down here. How would you know that I was going to be done by whatever?
[3114.78s -> 3120.70s]  Okay. Where's the paraglider? I encourage you to slow down for a moment, my courageous friend.
[3120.70s -> 3127.66s]  The appearance of those towers in the awakening of the shrine is all connected to that Sheikah
[3127.66s -> 3134.81s]  slate you carry on your hip there. What do you mean? Well, it's been quite some time since I have
[3134.81s -> 3141.29s]  seen that Sheikah slate long ago. Highly advanced tribe known as the Sheikah inhabited these lands.
[3141.29s -> 3146.49s]  The great power of their wisdom saved this kingdom time and time again, but their ancient
[3146.49s -> 3152.71s]  technology disappeared long ago. Or so it is said. It's interesting, however, to think how
[3152.71s -> 3158.68s]  something like that survived all this time hidden away in a shrine. These shrines are tucked away in
[3158.68s -> 3166.58s]  numerous places across the land. On this plateau alone, I believe there are three. Three. Bring me
[3166.58s -> 3171.83s]  the treasure from each of these shrines and I will give you my paraglider. That was not the deal.
[3171.83s -> 3178.52s]  Oh, well, I suppose I changed my mind. I'm sure that won't be a problem for a young go-getter
[3178.52s -> 3186.68s]  like you. I'll also teach you a trick for finding shrines. It's always best to survey the area by
[3186.68s -> 3190.36s]  looking around from a high point. Let's see here. How about you make your way to the top of that
[3190.36s -> 3199.77s]  tower again? Really? I was just up there. That didn't even stick. I didn't get anything on me.
[3199.77s -> 3215.64s]  You know what I mean? That didn't even apply. Okay. Take a look at the map on your Sheikah slate.
[3215.64s -> 3220.84s]  Take a look. I sent you a friend request on Pokemon Go. It was a few days ago and
[3221.70s -> 3226.10s]  now you don't have no pressure, but I mean, I think we could really find some monsters together.
[3226.10s -> 3231.80s]  Okay. See those blue icons? You should recognize the cave where you woke, the shrine where you
[3231.80s -> 3239.85s]  came from in the tower. Travel instantly to any of those places with the Sheikah slate.
[3239.85s -> 3257.51s]  Fix that one strand of hair. All right. So let's go back up here. Wait, I need to figure out this
[3258.15s -> 3281.45s]  lake puzzle, right? If everything's a little puzzle, then I have to figure it out. Oh,
[3281.45s -> 3290.63s]  shit. Cool. I can chop down trees. What's that? All right. The way there's something interesting
[3290.63s -> 3319.05s]  here. Is this poisonous? No, but it apparently is quicksand. Wait a minute. I have this. Wait,
[3319.05s -> 3322.73s]  I can, can I pull the treasures from under the, hold on a second. I think I got it.
[3330.60s -> 3334.20s]  Those are not treasures. I can't, I can't grab those and not made it a metal.
[3334.84s -> 3404.65s]  It is very clearly a jump here. What are the, what are the metal? Is it a metal? Dude, go back.
[3404.65s -> 3442.71s]  I'm, I'm just surveying the area. What is that? Let them explore there. Okay. Sorry. I didn't,
[3442.71s -> 3446.71s]  I didn't. Okay. All right. All right. All right. I didn't know what this was attached to. All right.
[3446.71s -> 3467.29s]  What do I do about this? All the way I have to put it inside. You fucking piece of shit.
[3477.22s -> 3490.65s]  Do I have to put the, like score it like a basket? Yeah. Haha. You found me. You're not
[3490.65s -> 3496.41s]  Hestu, but you can see me. I didn't know your kind could see the children in the forest.
[3499.16s -> 3547.59s]  Give this to Hestu. A Korok seed. Okay. No, I want to be able to pick up the item he dropped.
[3551.34s -> 3583.69s]  Oh my God. Whatever. Can I, do I have to come back here? Why is this blinking? Why is this
[3583.69s -> 3587.74s]  blinking? It's like, it's like blink, blink, blink. Like come over here. Blink, blink, blink.
[3587.74s -> 3598.02s]  Do something here. What is it telling me? Well, those are the arrows. I, okay. Whatever. I'll be,
[3598.02s -> 3610.20s]  I'll come back later. Fuck it. They're your arrows. Well, I didn't know that they blinked.
[3628.04s -> 3637.58s]  This game is cool. I like it. What's the height for fall damage? Is it bad? I don't know. I'm
[3637.58s -> 3690.68s]  just going to see. Like, can I, is it, how far, how high is it? Almost there. Oh, okay. Thank you.
[3690.68s -> 3716.09s]  Thank you. I think I've had to sneeze. Okay. I'm glad I got that out. That's been sitting there
[3716.09s -> 3723.53s]  for the last 45 minutes. I swear to God. Okay. You certainly took your time. Did you forget how to
[3723.53s -> 3735.30s]  fast travel? Yes, I did. Now then I want you to join me up here so you can look at,
[3735.30s -> 3754.63s]  out there to find another. I already see it. The scope. Oh, that's what I saw before with that.
[3754.63s -> 3787.24s]  Look, it's over there. Uh, no, I got it. Wait. Oh, finding the shrines more than one. Okay.
[3787.24s -> 3802.74s]  Wait, take those pins away. There's way too many. How do I get rid of them? I'm doing an orbital
[3802.74s -> 3809.59s]  strike on that place. Uh, I want to put, whatever. There's three, right? How do I take them down?
[3809.59s -> 3840.62s]  So now there's one more, he said. One, two. Did I already get that one? Did I already get this one?
[3840.62s -> 3856.12s]  I got them, right? The ones you finished turn blue. Okay. So then there's three. Isn't that what he
[3856.12s -> 3886.97s]  said? To find three of them? Or three more. Oh, just go to them. Okay. So which, this one's on
[3886.97s -> 3896.60s]  the ground level. I'm doing this one first. I like this one. I like this. This is cool.
[3896.60s -> 3927.50s]  Should I check? I'm going to investigate this camp. Do you have to sleep or anything?
[3927.50s -> 3967.75s]  Oh, an arm. Comes back to life. How do you, how do you permanently kill these? These things are
[3967.75s -> 3977.64s]  five? The woodcutter's axe is dog shit in comparison. All right. I'm going to keep this for now.
[3977.64s -> 3983.50s]  All right. I'm going to, let me invest. Wait, is there a way to put a food on your quick bar or
[3983.50s -> 4011.38s]  something? Completely fucking missed. All right. Whatever. This thing's already, I touched one thing
[4011.38s -> 4028.17s]  with it. It's a, what does it, why does it just explode? Somebody, what happened in there? Okay.
[4028.17s -> 4035.56s]  I guess I'm going to just loot your whole place. Somebody, somebody really fucked up in here.
[4043.50s -> 4072.07s]  God damn it. Just scared the shit out of me. Okay. Cool. So you can only carry a certain amount of
[4072.07s -> 4093.29s]  things. Let's put the, let's put the club on. I feel like I don't want to eat a lot of this stuff.
[4093.29s -> 4113.75s]  How much is it? Do you get for this? Spiked club. So what was actually in here? You hold right D pad.
[4113.75s -> 4125.53s]  You can switch between. All right. That, thank you so much. What do we got? Fire arrows. Cool. Got it.
[4125.53s -> 4139.66s]  It was the weirdest way I could have possibly done that. All right. That was cool. A little dungeon,
[4139.66s -> 4163.02s]  a little dungeon. What should we do now that hell has frozen over? Um, I don't know. Oh,
[4163.02s -> 4168.55s]  you can probably activate those. And that is a map reveal. What's up there? All right. I like this
[4168.55s -> 4197.93s]  game. I like this game. I didn't say anything else. Everyone hold off. Okay. I can, I can grab those.
[4197.93s -> 4209.69s]  I got to go back to that other shrine. Amber. It's been valued as a component in decorations
[4209.69s -> 4245.11s]  and crafting since ancient times. Cool. And the shrines right here, right? Get away from me.
[4246.07s -> 4280.98s]  What is the dodge? There has to be a dodge. Why? Because games with two frame invincibility
[4280.98s -> 4286.10s]  dodge rolls are my favorites. So I want it to be in everything. All right. I get it. I'm going to,
[4286.10s -> 4300.34s]  I'm going to hide behind something in the ruins and be fine. Ready? Watch this. Jesus.
[4332.47s -> 4342.46s]  You can't outrun it. I was seeing if you could outrun it with a sprint. I was seeing if you're
[4342.46s -> 4405.08s]  going to run with the sprints. Relax. Crouch. I need a weapon so I can outrun it. No, I cannot
[4405.16s -> 4420.20s]  actually. Stop telling me I can outrun it. I'm going to use my bow. Yeah, bro. You can. I can.
[4420.20s -> 4473.45s]  No, you cannot. How do I put the bow down? What? Why can I hurt this? Everything's breaking.
[4474.95s -> 4487.62s]  I shoot it in like the neck. Oh shit. It's emote only. I actually don't know what I in the head.
[4488.42s -> 4514.92s]  My bow is gone. What was that for? Um, where's the bow? No, don't throw this. How do I put this down?
[4516.57s -> 4524.55s]  How do you quick equip the bow? I have a second bow. How do I equip a bow quickly?
[4524.55s -> 4558.14s]  Does it have like a thing on its head? Can I climb it? I can't hurt this. I think,
[4558.14s -> 4592.33s]  do I have to shoot it in its neck? Is that working? It's not working. I don't think I can kill
[4592.33s -> 4598.66s]  this. I have to like go pick up a fucking heavy box and throw it at it. I don't get it. Shoot it
[4598.66s -> 4611.69s]  in the eye. I am. I have no air. I cannot fight this thing. I don't have, I'm definitely, I don't
[4611.69s -> 4629.00s]  have an item that I need to kill this. Yeah. I need the ancient gear to make the ancient gear
[4629.00s -> 4667.45s]  arrow to shoot it in the eye with the ancient gear arrow tip. I put this into the coin slot.
[4667.45s -> 4673.03s]  All right. I actually don't know what the fuck to do. What about shooting the ears?
[4677.54s -> 4681.22s]  I think I just have to shoot it there. I actually think I just keep doing this over and over again.
[4694.86s -> 4705.56s]  No, that's wrong. Nay, nay, nay. Okay. So is there something else here I can do?
[4706.36s -> 4722.09s]  Wait, is there something? Can I crush it? No, no, no, no. Wait. Okay. Should I just leave?
[4724.30s -> 4736.25s]  Am I missing a very specific item that I need to kill this? Nay, nay. Yeah. Yeah. It's yeah. I'm
[4736.25s -> 4760.74s]  telling you that I picked up the gear. All right. I'm out of here. Okay. The judge by shrine. This
[4760.74s -> 4784.10s]  game is pretty sick. I love breath of the wild. Cool. I hope I like it as much as you do. You
[4784.10s -> 4798.46s]  should play sonic adventure. Didn't I already play sonic adventure on stream long time ago
[4798.46s -> 4812.98s]  during a dream cast night or dream cast week, whatever it was. Okay. Second shrine. Yeah, I did.
[4812.98s -> 4829.37s]  In the name of the goddess Hylia, I offer this trial bomb trial. All right, let's turn it on.
[4829.37s -> 4846.66s]  Can you just make this the new Elden ring where you play it every single stream? I don't know.
[4846.66s -> 4866.89s]  We'll see. Do I see if I like it? I have to enjoy it for a while. Whoa. Okay. The force of the blast
[4866.89s -> 4878.87s]  can be used to damage monsters or destroy objects. I wonder what I do with that now. Okay. They're
[4878.87s -> 4884.97s]  both round and cube bombs. We use whatever was better for the situation. Okay. So I go take that
[4884.97s -> 4904.68s]  back outside and I just throw bombs at that thing and blow its head off. Got you. So it's just a
[4904.68s -> 4930.28s]  cool down. It's not, there's no mana. Just cool down. Cool. Oh, okay. I have to detonate them.
[4930.28s -> 4942.20s]  Ooh, it's in here. Pretty great. All right. I'm never going to use that. Your inventory is full.
[4942.20s -> 4973.24s]  What? I was getting rid of it. Damn. This thing's cool. All right. Put this away. I'm probably never
[4973.24s -> 4979.30s]  going to equip this for the rest of the entire playthrough. I'm going to run into so many problems
[4979.30s -> 4986.12s]  with this. Uh, the, this game system where things break, I will never use a good weapon until like
[4986.12s -> 5008.62s]  the last boss and I'll cycle through five of them. Anything down here? This is too complicated. I
[5008.62s -> 5044.07s]  quit. I can't climb this. No, I cannot climb smooth surfaces. Sound design of the game is really nice.
[5044.07s -> 5153.70s]  It does sound really good. It is a very nice sound. Okay. I think I did it. Can I get launched from
[5153.70s -> 5162.66s]  these? Well, that's fun. I can. So hold on. I'm not going to do that. I want to get launched from
[5162.66s -> 5173.26s]  that one. Yeah, I know. I'm getting the chest. I want to make sure they didn't kill you instantly
[5173.26s -> 5185.38s]  or something. Just like you're dead. I was hoping it would. I was trying to time it.
[5204.39s -> 5221.56s]  Amber. Okay, cool. Now I've take this and I probably put it into something over here, right?
[5221.56s -> 5246.46s]  I guess not. Your resourcefulness in overcoming this trial speaks to the promise of a hero.
[5246.46s -> 5255.90s]  In the name of goddess Hylia, I bestow upon you the spirit orb. That wasn't not that hard.
[5255.90s -> 5265.78s]  The fact that nobody has stumbled in here and done this simple pick the ball up puzzle. This is
[5265.78s -> 5273.24s]  a, this place is full of fucking idiots and no one's come down here and done that.
[5273.24s -> 5281.42s]  Oh, the ancient trial where it's only the truest of heroes can pick a ball up and put it next to
[5281.42s -> 5290.09s]  this thing to blow up. That's really not that hard. It wasn't activated till you touch the tower.
[5290.09s -> 5298.28s]  You need the tablet. All right, but why make it so easy for me, right? If like,
[5298.28s -> 5303.32s]  if you need the tablet to come in here, shouldn't don't they want to have some barrier
[5303.32s -> 5306.60s]  and make sure that the hero can actually do shit and not just have it be a simple
[5306.60s -> 5310.52s]  pick the ball up puzzle? If you want to make sure this guy's got what it takes,
[5310.52s -> 5316.33s]  you put a, you, you, you put like a Griffin in one of these, then you'll find somebody that you
[5316.33s -> 5322.86s]  can fucking really deal with again. You put like a fucking Hydra in one, in one of these and have it
[5322.86s -> 5332.14s]  be a wall of Sudokus before you get to that point. You want the real hero? I'm talking a mural of
[5332.14s -> 5344.14s]  Sudokus. Eventually someone might be able to do it. You know how many heroes would go down to the
[5344.14s -> 5348.86s]  wall of Sudokus? There's like 5,000 Sudokus and just be like, I'm not gonna open this. I'm out of
[5348.86s -> 5373.21s]  here. Is that working? All right. Well, I did that one. So I should clear that section. Is this
[5373.21s -> 5386.86s]  hurting? I don't think it's hurt. Okay. Let me get out of here. So I did that. That's good.
[5388.87s -> 5410.65s]  Now let's head this way. Ooh, give me this. Very cool. This is a Nintendo switch shirt.
[5410.65s -> 5415.99s]  You just pulled me out of the game. So bad. I'm now out of the game. I've now, this is, I'm,
[5415.99s -> 5419.75s]  I'm going to like a Zelda convention now. This is no longer breath of the wild. What happened?
[5420.31s -> 5452.18s]  You pulled me out. I'm a gamer now. I'm going up. We're that way. Probably. It's too bad.
[5452.18s -> 5478.15s]  There's not an emo where you can just be like, what was up in these trees? Nothing. Flowers?
[5478.15s -> 5496.52s]  Nothing. Which one's closer? This one or this one? Oh, this one by far is closer. How do I get up
[5496.52s -> 5562.47s]  there? Yeah. I can't care anymore. Are there bees? Oh shit. Oh, yeah. Can I get it? Give me that
[5562.47s -> 5610.84s]  quick. What's the agro range? Okay. We're good. All right. How do I get up there? All right. Well,
[5610.84s -> 5630.31s]  there's the old man. It's a pear. Spicy pepper. Ooh, old man's diary. Don't, this is kind of
[5630.31s -> 5641.74s]  fucked up. Should I read this? Spicy meat and seafood fry. Not only restores health,
[5641.74s -> 5653.14s]  but also keeps me warm even when traveling in the snowy mountains. Okay. I forgot to write down a
[5653.14s -> 5658.87s]  very important recipe. I know it contained raw meat and spicy pepper. However, I can't remember
[5658.87s -> 5665.05s]  what else I used. Sadly, on this lonely plateau, I have only my known knowledge and memory to rely
[5665.05s -> 5669.67s]  on. If I did find someone who knew the missing ingredient, I would happily reward them with my
[5669.67s -> 5724.65s]  warm doublet. Okay. Shield! You can pass time by a fire. Uh, let me talk to you. Ooh, fancy that. We
[5724.65s -> 5729.75s]  meet again. This body of mine isn't what it used to be. Recovering from bout of hard work takes a
[5729.75s -> 5736.25s]  while. If you're hungry, I have an empty pot you can use to cook yourself a meal. Open your inventory,
[5736.25s -> 5740.12s]  grab hold of your ingredients, and toss them in. Try to consider how the ingredients will
[5740.12s -> 5755.83s]  complement one another. You can even make a dish that increases your stamina. Sick. Oh, food. Wait,
[5755.83s -> 5771.51s]  how do you cook? You have to hold it? Hold. Hold? Hold, hold, hold. Oh, oh, oh, I see what you mean.
[5771.51s -> 5792.26s]  Okay, what about like a mushroom? You want some cooked fucking poisonous mushrooms? And, ooh! Oh,
[5792.34s -> 5807.30s]  shit! Okay. What about a cooked acorn and fish souffle? Fish? Wait, hold on. Two fishes, an egg,
[5808.81s -> 5813.61s]  and spicy peppers, and some fucking honey. How does that sound? That sounds like a pretty good
[5813.61s -> 5845.16s]  batch to me. Glazed seafood, bro! How about some rubies for crunch? Uh, gear, a bat wing, and like
[5845.48s -> 5865.85s]  a fucking monster eye. Dude, did I, what? Did I just actually make a special food? Go make grass
[5865.85s -> 5874.39s]  and shit? Wait, you can cook grass? All right, what about an egg? Egg, acorn, spicy pepper, and
[5875.96s -> 5897.88s]  ancient screw. Wait, like, why can I cook that? All right, um, you can do that? That's so stupid.
[5897.96s -> 5904.23s]  That wasn't an important item or anything, right? Was that actually, that was not like
[5904.23s -> 5921.29s]  an important thing I need, is it? Eat it. No? Okay, good. Thank God. Okay, if they added a puke,
[5921.29s -> 5925.34s]  this would be a full letter grade higher. If I came out of the menu and he just went,
[5926.70s -> 5935.08s]  just green sludge came out of his mouth. All right, well, that's cool. You can just make recipes?
[5943.02s -> 5967.03s]  Really? Whoa! Apple tree right here. Look at all these apples up here. Well, I'm gonna make like
[5967.03s -> 5980.49s]  an apple pie. The cooking part's my favorite thing. I don't want to cut this down. Is there
[5980.49s -> 5995.62s]  a seed? I actually did not really want to cut that down. What if I did apple and wood, you know,
[5995.62s -> 6021.77s]  for crunch? How much wood should I get? I feel like I should do this now so I don't do this later.
[6022.49s -> 6058.18s]  Leaf, leaf, leaf, leaf, leaf, leaf. I mean leaf. Leaf, leaf, leaf. Oh, um, whoa! All right, don't,
[6058.18s -> 6095.32s]  I don't want to use that. I'll make an apple pie or something. Spicy apple mushroom pie. Ooh,
[6095.32s -> 6100.38s]  grants low level cold resistance. The sweet dish is made by heaping tasty fruits into a pan and
[6100.38s -> 6109.58s]  simmering until tender. I get four and a half minutes of, uh, cold resist. That is by far the
[6109.58s -> 6114.92s]  most fun part of the game so far, without a doubt. That's awesome. That's really fun to do.
[6115.72s -> 6128.23s]  The fact you can make your own recipes, that's death. Okay, so how do I get across here? Good
[6128.23s -> 6156.39s]  question. Up there and then left. Tree, tree, tree. Climb the tree or knock the tree down.
[6172.41s -> 6187.18s]  Can you actually climb this whole thing? I'm mainly curious about that. Can you get to the top?
[6187.74s -> 6222.63s]  Can I, can I go up and like put my legs up like Spider-Man? Okay, I made it. Okay, so you cannot
[6222.63s -> 6241.96s]  get there from that. You, uh, you probably just chop it down. What was it? Hold. Oh, right. That
[6241.96s -> 6260.92s]  didn't work either. What the fuck? What? That didn't work. Cut the other one. You guys are
[6260.92s -> 6324.57s]  fucking with me. Oh, fuck off. All right. What's the, it's holding. What button do you hold to,
[6324.57s -> 6338.70s]  I don't know. It's hold, hold this shit. Hold that shit. Hold right. Okay. It's hold right.
[6338.70s -> 6353.72s]  What's this? Ooh, a spear. Explain. I know it's a hold right and then press the right stick and then
[6353.72s -> 6360.44s]  let go. And I, I, I know, I know it's contextual pressed, pulled button key mapping. Where's my
[6360.44s -> 6390.18s]  food? Boomer reflexes. There's way more than four buttons in this. You know how I feel about it.
[6390.18s -> 6417.94s]  Okay. Can I climb up here? I might be able to climb this scared the fuck out of me. All right.
[6417.94s -> 6430.71s]  Um, I don't think I can climb that. I want to get all these apples though. Emote only. Yeah.
[6430.71s -> 6441.78s]  The emote only only makes it so I can't see all the back seaters. Just give me the fuck. I want
[6441.78s -> 6452.76s]  all the apples. Give them. I want them. Give them to me. Too lazy to climb to the right spot.
[6452.76s -> 6463.42s]  So I just cut the whole tree down. Okay. So then over here. Ah, I can climb that.
[6466.09s -> 6489.05s]  Okay. Ooh, there's purple mushrooms over here. What are these? Rush room. Oh,
[6489.05s -> 6493.53s]  raggy. There's a rush room over here. A mushroom that can almost grow anywhere.
[6493.53s -> 6518.39s]  Cook it before eating to temporarily increase your movement speed. Okay. A lot of, a lot of rush
[6518.39s -> 6529.54s]  rooms over here. I'll check this out. It's why I just blew up my face. Oh my God, dude,
[6529.54s -> 6538.20s]  this is going to be fucking awesome. Check this out. I'm going to hit this person in the fucking
[6538.20s -> 6564.38s]  head. Oh, there's no arrows. Whatever. Can you craft arrows? Hop left for bow. Oh shit. Don't
[6564.38s -> 6583.27s]  jump again. Oh, close. All right. This is over here. And okay. I got to go to the right here.
[6583.27s -> 6600.02s]  What the hell is that? I'm going to put somebody going to throw a rock over here. No one's going
[6600.02s -> 6630.79s]  to come step on my fingers when I get to the top. I think I'm good. Something died up here. All
[6630.79s -> 6661.40s]  right. Oh, I die. I'm trying. Let's do it. This game's sick. He's doing it. But I'm playing it.
[6661.40s -> 6677.85s]  I bet you he's never going to play this again. Don't be so sure who sets foot in this shrine.
[6677.85s -> 6696.39s]  I am Oh, I die. I am in the name of the goddess Hylia. I offer you this trial stealing rune.
[6696.39s -> 6705.96s]  Now what if I just leaned over and opened my mouth and caught that in my mouth? Would that ruin
[6705.96s -> 6721.82s]  everything? Would I have blue diarrhea for a year? Stop the flow of time for an object.
[6721.82s -> 6726.01s]  I'm out of the loop. Is this your first playthrough? I've never played this. This is
[6726.01s -> 6737.03s]  my first Zelda game in 15 years. It's got to be 15 to 17, 18. When did Majora's Mask come out
[6737.03s -> 6749.22s]  in Ocarina of Time? That was like 1996. We're talking about like 17 years. It's been a long
[6749.22s -> 6767.32s]  fucking time. Okay. So it's time stop. How long ago was it? Majora's Mask was 22 years ago? Oh
[6767.32s -> 6781.96s]  my God. All right. So obviously we're going to go like this. Wait, how long is it? I'm trying to,
[6782.04s -> 6788.52s]  whatever. I'm, I'm, I'm holding jump to grab, but that's not how you do it. It's not hold,
[6788.52s -> 6794.01s]  jump, grab. It's hold, jump, and you have to hold X. You have to, there's like a grab button you
[6794.01s -> 6836.47s]  have to press. Ah, cool down. Chest or anything? You should name your horse shit stain. So there's
[6836.47s -> 6846.22s]  a horse in the game. I didn't know that until you just said it. That looks cool. Iron sledgehammer.
[6846.22s -> 6855.66s]  Oh my fucking God. I don't know. What did I just drop? What did I just drop? All right.
[6855.66s -> 6863.94s]  Throw this thing away. Wait, let me see what the moveset is like. This thing's awesome. I
[6863.94s -> 6897.18s]  don't have room for it. Torch. Should I hold onto the torch? Okay. I want that. Yep. Sledgehammers
[6897.18s -> 6915.94s]  are very important. You'll want one at all times. Okay. It reminds me of this, the Wario where the
[6916.10s -> 6920.04s]  Dun-dun-dun-dun....
[6920.18s -> 6932.30s]  That's like din-din-din-din-dun-din-dun-din-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun
[6932.62s -> 6983.45s]  Can I move it? Uh, will the, will this work? Why would that work?
[6983.45s -> 6987.61s]  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun
[6987.61s -> 7031.88s]  Spirit orb? Three spirit orbs. Okay, I got one more tutorial shrine to do. Go back and read
[7031.88s -> 7041.77s]  the tutorials? If I need to, I will. All right, there's only one remaining and it's up there.
[7041.77s -> 7090.34s]  The temperature is getting diversely low. Find of find warm. How many? How many clothes that guy that's gonna help this? He's shrunk
[7091.86s -> 7101.03s]  The temperature the temperature when it reaches a certain level. Well, how do I get the fuck out of here?
[7101.35s -> 7128.12s]  Where's the hot spot? Come on. So it's too cold. I wait I have food
[7128.52s -> 7133.88s]  Okay grants a low level cold resistance. The sweet dish is made of okay
[7133.88s -> 7139.96s]  So I got four and a half minutes if I eat this then I have about five minutes to walk around, right?
[7140.12s -> 7145.21s]  Let's go for it. I'll try to get there as quick as possible
[7145.45s -> 7162.92s]  So if I eat it not yet wait till it I get to the temperature drop. Okay temperature dropped
[7164.10s -> 7171.59s]  Okay, eat the food here. Eat it cold resistance. Let's go
[7180.94s -> 7188.87s]  I apparently got lost going to the nintendo convention. How did I end up here? Oh shit. Do I have a bow?
[7205.03s -> 7226.68s]  Okay, I got it. I did it. I'm fine. What was even over here? There's nothing even here. Oh wait chest
[7227.00s -> 7260.04s]  Come on, it's like a comfy hoodie. All right. Hurry up. Come on idiot
[7260.60s -> 7282.58s]  Loco shield. Whoa, cool. All right. I can't carry any more items three minutes on the cold resist five arrows
[7282.90s -> 7309.27s]  Come on, give me some gear green rupee. Oh shit. Okay. Can I climb? Okay climb this can I make it over over?
[7309.35s -> 7321.75s]  Wait, I have an idea. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[7322.07s -> 7344.41s]  I think I can't just sit up there and god just get up there. I can't stand on this looks like I can
[7344.81s -> 7357.11s]  All right, let's go
[7357.11s -> 7377.54s]  All right. I made it. Okay, it's right over there. I think is this freezing. How cold is this water?
[7377.62s -> 7400.78s]  Okay, well we're going a different way. Why do you only have three health?
[7401.02s -> 7410.63s]  I don't know because I just started the game. It looks like this is a bridge or something right here
[7410.63s -> 7419.02s]  What is this line on the map? See this? What what is this? Oh, that's the waterfall edge
[7420.01s -> 7437.11s]  Um, shit. What do I do? I have one minute. Hold on. Hold on. Wait. Wait. I think I can maybe can I get up this?
[7446.73s -> 7481.80s]  I got one minute
[7481.96s -> 7490.41s]  Wait mushroom second, how do I cook? How do I cook food? Oh my god. I got this is no way
[7490.65s -> 7532.02s]  I can I can eat my way there though. Am I good? I can eat my way here. Are you kidding me guys?
[7532.34s -> 7553.43s]  I don't why don't have a weapon equipped. I gotta make quick work of this
[7562.84s -> 7575.30s]  Oh look look at the my temperature. My temperature is good. Take what is it? Oh, let's take that
[7575.38s -> 7592.58s]  Oh my god, take arrows. Is this food or anything? It is very cool. All right. Should I cook? All right two apples
[7593.86s -> 7625.16s]  One mushroom one rush room and a acorn toasty rush room roast. Oh, it's not
[7627.19s -> 7639.26s]  I just toasted everything. All right. Well, I didn't know I thought you could cook. All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait
[7639.26s -> 7641.26s]  Wait, if I light up this
[7643.53s -> 7672.60s]  The temperature's okay. I'm good. I get it. No, don't do that. No, I can't get it
[7672.60s -> 7683.64s]  All right. I hurry up get in here. Is it warm in here? It's got to be insulated in here, right?
[7684.04s -> 7719.54s]  I would imagine it's probably insulated. The temperature is
[7720.81s -> 7726.01s]  To you sets foot in the shrine. I am khan namut in the name of the goddess halei after this trial
[7727.14s -> 7760.74s]  Yeah, it's insulated insulated and it is not the oh wait pillar of ice from a water surface
[7760.98s -> 7768.27s]  Builds ice pillars that are very stable. These pillars can be used as stepping stones or as obstacles use cryonis
[7768.73s -> 7789.82s]  On an ice pillar to break it. That's a cool ability. Let's try it. Cool. So these how long do they last?
[7790.38s -> 7796.74s]  Can you only have one? Okay, you can have more than one
[7798.46s -> 7804.98s]  I love that sound
[7804.98s -> 7808.57s]  I love ice
[7808.57s -> 7812.78s]  You know, it's my favorite one of my favorite things in the world when you get an ice tray
[7813.10s -> 7815.78s]  so I like to make my own ice and
[7816.42s -> 7818.02s]  the thick
[7818.02s -> 7821.54s]  It takes like a whole day to freeze this in the freezer
[7822.30s -> 7830.33s]  But when you get those huge they're at least two inches tall and two inches wide almost they're these big
[7831.66s -> 7835.32s]  It's completely see-through thick ice chunks
[7835.88s -> 7840.86s]  I love just sitting that in a cup and just putting I don't know like ice tea in there
[7841.69s -> 7875.21s]  Like a coca-cola or something. Oh, how high can I make this? Is that as high as it goes?
[7896.47s -> 7942.94s]  Can't go higher than that. Oh
[7947.80s -> 7954.33s]  Fuck I just got hurt. I think I just hurt my chest. I'm just thinking about somebody looking at the security camp
[7956.25s -> 7958.25s]  This guy fucking dies right there
[7959.77s -> 7965.66s]  Oh that hurt. Ooh
[7965.82s -> 7974.65s]  All right, I'm just thinking somebody looking at the security monitors and oh hey somebody made it somebody got in
[7975.21s -> 7978.89s]  Yeah. Yeah, another adventurer. I wonder yeah what's giving the ice move?
[7981.05s -> 7986.73s]  And the guy throws a bomb against the wall it bounces off and fucking blows the guy smithereen
[7988.34s -> 7992.18s]  Nope, that one didn't make it wait another 5 000 years for the next one
[7998.79s -> 8003.80s]  Okay

[8013.08s -> 8062.30s]  Okay. So how do I get out of here? I can't even make it faster. Where is this door?
[8062.54s -> 8075.94s]  This is why you have a team. This is what a team is for guys. The wizard of oz
[8076.50s -> 8078.50s]  Told us a long long time ago
[8078.74s -> 8082.10s]  You get the guy that knows how to do the puzzles the guy that can dodge the x
[8082.42s -> 8087.14s]  with and they can kill things with melee weapons the strong one the smart one the
[8088.26s -> 8091.46s]  The the courageous one, right? We all can do something
[8092.55s -> 8096.07s]  We let the smart one do the puzzles and then I get in there with the fucking axe
[8097.18s -> 8100.62s]  And start swinging. That's the whole that we that we've learned this 100 years ago
[8100.62s -> 8109.91s]  That's why you need a team. Let the smart person figure this out while I smoke a cigarette over there in the corner
[8110.23s -> 8115.93s]  How do I get out of here? How do I do this?
[8130.73s -> 8150.41s]  Stop time. All right. I stopped time on that. This thing is made out of fucking metal. What?

[8220.26s -> 8228.68s]  I can dodge an axe with a swift kick fall backwards and smoke a cigarette and salt them with the rain
[8253.02s -> 8269.38s]  Well, this thing's made out of metal. We're good. Hold on. This is technically this is wait. This is water. Oh my god
[8269.46s -> 8271.22s]  Look what you can do
[8271.22s -> 8274.09s]  physics

[8391.82s -> 8399.50s]  Never before seen solutions. What do you what does that mean? All right, you're resourcefulness. You're very resourceful in the name of the goddess
[8399.50s -> 8431.21s]  Hylia, I bestow upon you this orb cool fucking chest

[8467.45s -> 8485.69s]  So you can't tell anybody about between me and you I didn't read that where the two
[8486.01s -> 8497.91s]  Lines connecting the shrines would cross there. I'll be waiting there were four shrines centered amid the four shrines
[8500.62s -> 8502.71s]  one
[8502.71s -> 8504.31s]  two
[8504.31s -> 8505.58s]  three
[8505.58s -> 8543.91s]  Four right about here. Okay. Why is that not on the map? It has to be a pin not a stamp. Oh
[8550.65s -> 8558.74s]  Mm-hmm
[8558.74s -> 8566.30s]  You bet your ass I can dodge it every weapon held in two hands if you only swung an axe
[8570.17s -> 8572.01s]  Yeah, I talk about in that movie
[8572.01s -> 8579.64s]  I how I can dodge everything and then I just get an arrow like through the temple like just goes like
[8583.94s -> 8586.25s]  Can't dodge that
[8591.85s -> 8592.81s]  Okay

[8632.38s -> 8635.18s]  Man, you look like we can play the game two different ways
[8635.90s -> 8655.46s]  It's a little chilly out though
[8656.42s -> 8670.82s]  A sword and stone can I climb and hold on?
[8686.16s -> 8695.54s]  Rusty broadsword does not you do that does not constitute putting that into a stone like that
[8696.52s -> 8698.52s]  That's not that interesting

[8857.14s -> 8863.98s]  It could get delayed. Couldn't it?

[9190.46s -> 9199.80s]  Oh, he said he's bringing him to a party
[9200.71s -> 9207.96s]  Okay, it appears you have four spirit orbs in exchange. I will amplify your being oh
[9208.84s -> 9222.52s]  This is important you guys adult juice boxes already exist
[9222.60s -> 9230.10s]  It's called just going and getting orange juice from the grocery store a pretty adult beverage

[9258.73s -> 9266.17s]  Just don't get hit. Give me a break. Cool. All right, very cool. Ooh, I get extra little
[9266.33s -> 9282.95s]  Uh thing there give me the glider. Is my fps on this camera fine?
[9283.19s -> 9291.08s]  Yeah, the blessing of the goddess has made you much more resilient. I see here. I am get up here quickly
[9291.32s -> 9313.40s]  Do you know that never happened in tf2?
[9313.48s -> 9318.54s]  I always tried to get it but it never happened coming out of a map or come out of the spawn and just
[9319.42s -> 9326.84s]  Knocking a huntsman arrow across the whole map and just waiting to hear that come. I tried it probably
[9327.38s -> 9332.42s]  Ten to twenty thousand different times. It's just so hard to do
[9341.80s -> 9346.04s]  By the way, if there's not a single way i'm ever gonna play a different zelda game than this
[9346.60s -> 9354.33s]  As I find this to be a hundred times cooler than any of the zelda games i've ever played he talks
[9354.57s -> 9362.87s]  I truly am. I was king rome
[9363.51s -> 9372.70s]  Bosporamus hyrule or my shortened name. I was ganondorf the last leader of hyrule a kingdom which no longer exists
[9375.18s -> 9386.57s]  Oh, is this the dinner guy?
[9388.28s -> 9392.47s]  Devastated everything in its path lo a century ago
[9393.69s -> 9397.05s]  It was then that my life was taken away from me
[9398.06s -> 9401.82s]  And since that time here I have remained in spirit form
[9402.46s -> 9406.62s]  I did not think it wise to overwhelm you while your memory was still fragile
[9407.75s -> 9409.75s]  so rather than that
[9409.83s -> 9412.23s]  I thought it best to assume a temporary form
[9414.73s -> 9416.17s]  Forgive me
[9416.17s -> 9418.92s]  I think you are now ready
[9419.58s -> 9423.21s]  Ready to hear what happened three years ago
[9424.49s -> 9426.73s]  Somebody said why does he sound hot?
[9427.77s -> 9433.32s]  To know kalanin's true form what the fuck one must know the story from an age-long past
[9433.64s -> 9440.09s]  The demon king was born into this kingdom, but his transformation into malice created the horror you see now
[9442.24s -> 9448.58s]  Stories of ganon were passed from generation to generation in the form of legends and fairy tales
[9449.14s -> 9451.85s]  But there was also
[9451.85s -> 9462.39s]  Prophecy the signs of a resurrection of calamity ganon are clear the power to oppose it
[9463.61s -> 9467.29s]  lies dormant
[9467.37s -> 9473.61s]  We decided to heed the prophecy and began excavating large areas of land. I'm going to gamelan
[9474.17s -> 9480.33s]  Before we discovered several ancient relics to protect me in the hands of our distant ancestors fuck you link
[9482.06s -> 9488.30s]  I will eat you for dinner these relics the divine beasts were giant fuck you the king
[9489.51s -> 9493.29s]  Fuck you ganon
[9493.69s -> 9514.78s]  We also learned of a princess with a sacred power and her appointed knight chosen by the sword that seals the darkness
[9515.42s -> 9519.66s]  It was they who sealed ganon away using the power of these ancient relics
[9521.66s -> 9527.50s]  100 years ago. There was a princess set to inherit a secret. They always if they wanted to do something that they never said
[9528.30s -> 9530.94s]  Stringing together like six different consonants
[9531.98s -> 9534.97s]  Right. So if oh i'm going to gamelan
[9535.53s -> 9537.53s]  For
[9563.52s -> 9565.52s]  Sentence mixing
[9581.93s -> 9585.61s]  It's so great when it doesn't work at all, but you know what they were trying to do
[9586.49s -> 9593.37s]  He appeared from deep below hyrule castle sees definitely have seen videos of the spy from tf2 saying like
[9595.15s -> 9598.16s]  My
[9605.58s -> 9613.34s]  Like okay, I all right, I know what you were doing. I know what you were trying whatever and thus devastated
[9618.99s -> 9628.25s]  However, the princess survived to face ganon alone link
[9629.98s -> 9633.50s]  You are our final help
[9633.74s -> 9635.74s]  The fate of hyrule rests with you
[9640.84s -> 9642.52s]  Yeah, if you're like
[9642.52s -> 9645.56s]  my
[9645.56s -> 9648.00s]  Princess was my own daughter
[9648.00s -> 9655.37s]  My dear zelda and the courageous knight who protected her right up to the very end
[9657.08s -> 9661.64s]  That night was none other than you link you
[9663.16s -> 9670.50s]  When your fate took an unfortunate turn sure. Yeah, this does this does not seem right taken to the shrine of resurrection
[9671.06s -> 9676.58s]  Here you now stand revitalized 100 years in a switch game words of guidance
[9676.58s -> 9680.58s]  You have been hearing since your awakening are from princess zelda herself
[9681.62s -> 9683.06s]  Even now
[9683.06s -> 9688.42s]  As she works to restrain ganon from within hyrule castle. She calls out for your help
[9689.46s -> 9690.66s]  however
[9690.66s -> 9693.14s]  My daughter's power will soon be exhausted
[9693.78s -> 9695.78s]  once that happens
[9695.78s -> 9703.54s]  Ganon will freely regenerate himself and nothing will stop him from consuming our lives. It really what happened to be in my link costume
[9704.74s -> 9706.74s]  I'm still link. Does it matter? Who cares?
[9711.18s -> 9732.05s]  Link could just put on a green shirt. Who cares? What's the difference must save her as well as those guardians swarming around hyrule castle
[9732.53s -> 9737.84s]  I believe it would be quite reckless for you to head directly to the castle at this point
[9738.56s -> 9741.60s]  I suggest
[9741.68s -> 9744.88s]  That you make your way east out to one of the villages in the wilderness
[9746.48s -> 9748.72s]  Follow the road out to kakariko village
[9750.21s -> 9752.29s]  There you will find the elder impa
[9752.93s -> 9755.57s]  She will tell you more about the path that lies ahead
[9756.77s -> 9761.33s]  Consult the map on your sheikah slate for the precise location of kakariko village
[9762.37s -> 9765.25s]  Make your way past the twin summits of the dueling peaks
[9766.29s -> 9769.01s]  From there follow the road as it proceeds north
[9774.90s -> 9780.66s]  Hmm, thanks to the paraglider
[9784.19s -> 9788.06s]  Yay
[9788.06s -> 9803.31s]  Okay, press b while you're in the air to use it fly off cliffs and I think that's it
[9804.99s -> 9811.64s]  And I think that's it link you must save hyrule
[9812.58s -> 9818.26s]  Is he ever coming back?
[9819.14s -> 9826.94s]  Seek out impa. Okay, so now I can jump
[9829.17s -> 9843.17s]  All right, I want to pan over and have his mouth just be open like wide like
[9844.69s -> 9852.35s]  The air filling it
[9852.35s -> 9867.54s]  That would be so funny. All right, you can use it pretty much anywhere. Wait, hold on. Can I kill this thing now?
[9870.03s -> 9872.91s]  so I have
[9872.91s -> 9874.91s]  Uh stasis. Let's try this

[9895.02s -> 9899.62s]  Broke my shield actually blew my shield up never mind. All right, i'm getting the fuck out of here
[9900.34s -> 9918.38s]  All right, I want you in the chat to everyone to tell me why

[9931.65s -> 9933.65s]  I love adventure games. Okay, cool
[9934.48s -> 9937.68s]  Is sword ghost slash? Mm-hmm. They're kind of fun

[10354.26s -> 10356.82s]  I'm so fucking confused. Why did that happen?
[10376.29s -> 10377.41s]  No

[10495.38s -> 10499.54s]  I might just not be strong enough to do this
[10499.62s -> 10501.62s]  I don't think i'm strong enough to beat this guy
[10512.48s -> 10514.48s]  You piece of shit
[10524.48s -> 10532.16s]  Okay, i'm not strong enough, but I want to beat it so bad
[10537.14s -> 10555.63s]  One more try i'm taking both arms out. I'm gonna be very patient. Here we go patient time
[10559.09s -> 10561.09s]  There's both arms done
[10561.09s -> 10564.05s]  He's gonna smash his head. I'm gonna climb up his body
[10565.09s -> 10572.98s]  And i'm gonna get the no he grows the shit back
[10573.54s -> 10586.27s]  Fucking completely missed
[10617.79s -> 10676.82s]  Hey
[10676.82s -> 10679.14s]  Hey, put the fucking phone down
[10692.19s -> 10693.47s]  Oh
[10693.47s -> 10723.34s]  Can I shoot with arrows?
[10723.34s -> 10734.29s]  Yes, that does not do any damage at all though
[10740.69s -> 10749.86s]  I'm not strong enough to be here. I actually don't think i'm strong enough to be here
[10750.10s -> 10761.09s]  I think you come back in like 10 levels you come back in 10 plus levels
[10768.13s -> 10773.01s]  Just give up on the tree sentinel. Not yet. I will okay. I'm gonna get it here. I'm just gonna play
[10773.49s -> 10786.21s]  I'm gonna dodge and fight. How does that i'm done?
[10786.77s -> 10790.69s]  I'm fucking done. I'm leaving. I'm okay. I'm alive and live. I'm fine. I'm good
[10791.49s -> 10793.89s]  Bye i'm done. I'm coming back later. I'm not supposed to be here
[10793.89s -> 10796.69s]  Um, this is like something you do like in 10 levels or like 20 levels
[10797.17s -> 10799.97s]  Because you do the same this is like a late game fight
[10800.45s -> 10811.71s]  It's a late game fight
[10811.71s -> 10822.03s]  Can I I can't I don't think I can freeze him in time. Can I can I freeze his body?
[10822.59s -> 10832.21s]  I got chapstick all over the controller. I know I can't freeze him stop time
[10847.95s -> 10850.19s]  What is going on get out of here?
[10853.94s -> 10863.60s]  No, I just gotta fight him
[10863.60s -> 10866.48s]  If I think i'm safer, let me hold on. Okay
[10868.59s -> 10884.94s]  so
[10884.94s -> 10887.63s]  What happened? Um
[10889.26s -> 10894.22s]  That was such over dramatic bullshit link, please you could have gotten up five times
[10895.10s -> 10900.98s]  There's no referee to give anybody a red card here, please enough
[10932.90s -> 10938.51s]  I got a fucking idea
[10938.51s -> 10943.94s]  How's this for an idea?
[10943.94s -> 10948.70s]  Watch this
[10948.70s -> 10960.53s]  Eat shit
[10960.53s -> 10962.53s]  That's the play and then I just gotta get off
[10962.53s -> 11011.97s]  So i'm just not doing enough damage
[11011.97s -> 11022.72s]  Look at his health
[11022.72s -> 11026.18s]  Do it
[11026.42s -> 11030.02s]  What about the bow dude the bow does just as little fucking damage
[11031.92s -> 11040.82s]  The bow does less damage than that. I'm supposed to come back here after this. I'm not supposed to be here use the bow
[11041.30s -> 11042.74s]  Use the hammer
[11042.74s -> 11046.48s]  I need better weapons
[11046.48s -> 11048.56s]  Dude, stun him with arrows, huh?
[11068.16s -> 11071.04s]  All right. You got no arms now
[11071.04s -> 11075.46s]  Okay, here we go
[11075.46s -> 11118.27s]  Now he's gonna what dude some fucking stun that is that stun is not even one second
[11134.14s -> 11171.20s]  Lock on that shit don't last long enough. When does this motherfucker go down?
[11171.92s -> 11201.89s]  I can't beat him. I don't have explosive arrows
[11214.05s -> 11220.00s]  Fuck that. I I know I can't kill him. That's not true. Yeah, it is. What am I supposed to do? Look

[11255.84s -> 11258.24s]  I die in one hit i'm not supposed to be here
[11277.62s -> 11282.27s]  Okay, what's this
[11282.83s -> 11293.44s]  Hold on

[11307.63s -> 11325.81s]  Marrow to do damage
[11337.33s -> 11339.33s]  Bro chill with the chapstick

[11364.61s -> 11368.26s]  No, you can't you're not supposed to
[11369.39s -> 11371.39s]  All right, let's go. We're gonna new strong
[11371.95s -> 11387.06s]  How do I get the wind?

[11597.36s -> 11604.88s]  Unfucking believable. What year is it? Nintendo? What year is it?
[11629.18s -> 11653.92s]  2022 we don't have a quick slot for healing items. Okay, what is wrong?
[11657.76s -> 11662.98s]  What's what is going on? Why is it? Why can I not make it? I made it to before

[11746.70s -> 11752.56s]  Um, they're definitely not the same game, right? They're very different. They're pretty similar, but they're very different
[11753.20s -> 11755.76s]  So check this out
[11755.76s -> 11805.33s]  What is it 50 rupees? All right
[11806.38s -> 11811.74s]  Um, what's that over there? I'll check it out later
[11813.12s -> 11818.80s]  I okay that scared the shit out of me. I thought this was a gigantic dragon or something. I thought it was a huge dragon wing
[11819.52s -> 11824.21s]  Because I looked it was right there my breath rule. I thought it was a huge dragon
[11824.85s -> 11855.18s]  Let's get out
[11855.18s -> 11858.27s]  There's a villain. Is this an npc?
[11874.27s -> 11876.27s]  We're doomed. I mean don't panic. Sorry. Who are you?
[11876.35s -> 11880.22s]  Have we met doesn't matter who you are really I was getting tired of talking to myself
[11880.22s -> 11884.32s]  So you're coming a good time by the way those strange things that popped out of the ground
[11884.32s -> 11888.85s]  Did you see them talking about the mushrooms here? I'm talking about
[11889.33s -> 11890.21s]  Oh, okay
[11890.21s -> 11896.29s]  They seem to have popped up all over the place and that's not the only strange things happening those long deserted shrines suddenly started glowing
[11896.61s -> 11901.62s]  You know what that means. Don't you the end is near with all the craziness happening
[11901.62s -> 11903.62s]  I've been keeping an eye on that thing
[11903.62s -> 11905.62s]  Just to see if it suddenly starts moving
[11907.33s -> 11912.98s]  What thing talk about that guardian, of course, haven't you heard the old stories?
[11914.69s -> 11917.49s]  See that thing over there the one shaped like an overturned urn
[11918.53s -> 11920.77s]  That is what i'm talking about
[11920.77s -> 11924.29s]  Did you know that some of them can move one of them once chased me down and tried to kill me?
[11926.26s -> 11928.00s]  No, it was a different one
[11928.00s -> 11930.64s]  That one was closer to the castle but before the forest
[11931.62s -> 11933.39s]  When they spot you
[11933.39s -> 11937.78s]  They shoot blue beams of light at you man. I was so sure that was the end for me
[11937.78s -> 11942.14s]  I was prepared for the worst until uh, I got it right in the bone marrow
[11942.30s -> 11951.18s]  Let me tell you how to do it. I hear guardians like that still wander
[11951.90s -> 12023.74s]  Be careful. Thanks for no info. I'm just doing a physics test. Holy shit. What can I do anything with the ram?
[12032.26s -> 12102.50s]  I guess not. What are you doing? Where's my weapon way too high? Oh, this guy's kind of strong. Stop rolling
[12109.57s -> 12131.89s]  Boko bat
[12131.89s -> 12133.89s]  No, I want to pick up the item
[12136.96s -> 12140.82s]  Pick it up pick up the pick. I want to do what I just did
[12142.78s -> 12145.66s]  Pick up the fucking rock, please. I need to do this

[12193.17s -> 12196.75s]  Okay
[12196.75s -> 12203.55s]  He was trying to kill me. Oh, that's funny. Okay. All right, so
[12204.19s -> 12206.43s]  Uh, what did I get for that? There was a chest right here, right?
[12207.15s -> 12215.71s]  And this food over here. Ooh
[12216.03s -> 12217.07s]  Thank you
[12217.07s -> 12227.36s]  Try toast some more stuff
[12227.36s -> 12230.37s]  the opal destroy crates
[12232.03s -> 12235.86s]  They have stuff in them. Oh, they do. Okay
[12237.06s -> 12240.82s]  crab
[12240.82s -> 12244.26s]  Roasted bass. Oh shit. Thank you for the uh reminder. Seriously
[12245.06s -> 12267.06s]  Is there a way I can break them without damaging an item? Okay, well that didn't work. I can use the uh use magnet
[12268.29s -> 12270.85s]  Oh, I could just blow them up with an idiot
[12272.64s -> 12274.69s]  With a magnet
[12274.69s -> 12294.69s]  It was a shitty rusty sword. Anyways, who cares? It doesn't matter. Ooh blue rupee
[12295.25s -> 12342.94s]  I'm gonna eat one of those crabs. All right, let's keep going base cam is covering what what are you what's going on?
[12349.76s -> 12360.48s]  Go to the glowing mountain. I'm just gonna say there's an event on the mountain. What do you mean?
[12361.28s -> 12388.70s]  I almost fucking drowned in two feet of water again. Okay. No, no, no nay nay nay nay nay what?
[12405.30s -> 12465.74s]  God, I hope link gets in smash brothers this year. I thought it was friendly. Now the camp is this I like the sounds
[12469.25s -> 12484.86s]  It's very peaceful over here. There it is. Okay
[12519.60s -> 12523.66s]  Okay, this and bloodborne are my two favorite games
[12524.67s -> 12529.92s]  Well, I if you're saying bloodborne is one of your favorite games and this I probably would agree with you at some point
[12529.92s -> 12531.36s]  Maybe we'll find out
[12531.36s -> 12536.50s]  Is there anything else I've been over here?
[12536.50s -> 12541.92s]  You got me like an item in here, right?
[12541.92s -> 12565.18s]  Pass me an item. There's no way there's no item here. Why would there be a camp with no item?
[12573.04s -> 12580.26s]  What is the actual destination here? Oh my god, that's far away. That's across the whole game
[12580.58s -> 12585.18s]  Can I even make it can I make it there?
[12595.07s -> 12596.72s]  well
[12596.72s -> 12600.80s]  Um, maybe I should activate that thing, right?
[12601.60s -> 12604.42s]  Give me some location data
[12606.85s -> 12608.85s]  Dude, you just got elden ring
[12612.29s -> 12615.63s]  Oh, I kind of did
[12615.63s -> 12624.14s]  All right
[12624.14s -> 12627.18s]  You can go anywhere and you can climb anything. I got elden ring
[12627.90s -> 12655.49s]  Stop saying elden ring elden
[12655.73s -> 12658.45s]  Okay, do you know how hard it's gonna be to not say anything about elden ring?
[12658.45s -> 12664.87s]  I know i'm not supposed to be but think about it. That was one of like the most ridiculous
[12666.82s -> 12675.58s]  Hold on a sec
[12675.58s -> 12677.82s]  The bow broken my hands. Okay. Well never mind
[12683.23s -> 12710.37s]  Yeah, let's get this guy's another strong one. Oh my god. I just baseball swung him
[12714.18s -> 12742.19s]  Where are you going? Is there an instant kill backstab or something that he didn't wake up? Why?
[12761.70s -> 12765.28s]  Hello
[12765.28s -> 12805.22s]  Why is why did that happen? It was the fire does that really I can cook over here
[12806.67s -> 12812.42s]  All right. Oh, let me open it. Let me I want to cook some stuff. All right, so
[12813.49s -> 12814.53s]  I have
[12814.53s -> 12820.66s]  A lot of random stuff one shroom two shrooms
[12821.74s -> 12845.92s]  Okay, how about like a shroom surprise mushroom skewer? Can I just what happens if you just cook one apple?
[12853.20s -> 12856.46s]  Simmered fruit. Okay, so it's only one now you gotta
[12861.12s -> 12867.65s]  This is gonna be three hearts
[12867.65s -> 12882.88s]  Right. Yeah. Okay. So it's it's about quantity means more health. I get it. Okay, cool
[12885.54s -> 12887.30s]  Was there a chest?
[12889.34s -> 12902.21s]  I don't think so, right
[12902.21s -> 12910.93s]  Chasing fucking apples around like an idiot chasing apples around like a dumb ass
[12913.76s -> 12928.22s]  All right. Let's turn this thing on
[12928.30s -> 12949.73s]  Dueling peaks tower. It's a map info here simplify the hud if you want some immersion
[12950.13s -> 12974.42s]  Um, I think I want it for now. I think I'd rather have it for now do motion aiming
[12974.58s -> 12983.84s]  I hate motion aiming it only ever worked in my brain for the wii using two hands to use a gyroscope is
[12984.46s -> 12988.62s]  Unbearable for me. The wii was fine because the wii was one hand, right?
[12989.18s -> 12993.49s]  It was almost like a mouse pointer but needing to hold two hands like this
[12994.21s -> 13006.02s]  And go like a no, no, no, no doesn't work for me at all. I don't like it use the joycons
[13006.18s -> 13016.93s]  Why would I ever use the joycons? The joycons are my least favorite controller ever made
[13019.94s -> 13028.64s]  They are hands down the worst possible device that was ever invented. They are so bad. They are so small
[13029.28s -> 13036.32s]  The buttons are so tiny pressing. I i'm saying i'm telling you if you try to press
[13037.52s -> 13043.38s]  X on a joycon if there's a lot there's a real possibility you're going to hit every single other button
[13043.38s -> 13051.54s]  That's a face button. They're so bad. They're just so tiny and so it's like hurts to hold them for a long time
[13062.16s -> 13064.40s]  Oh, we effing looks like it
[13067.14s -> 13069.14s]  It looks like we're seeing some some small f
[13069.86s -> 13082.83s]  Behavior here. Okay. Oh, there's a road. It's like a road here a sheikah sensor
[13083.23s -> 13087.34s]  The sensor reacts when you are close to shrines that you've not yet visited
[13087.58s -> 13096.78s]  Okay, you head in the direction where the reaction is strongest you should be able to find the shrine, okay
[13099.31s -> 13101.49s]  Wait, it's on the map. That's weird
[13102.13s -> 13115.74s]  When you play dog island, didn't I already play dog island search for shrines by moving in the direction with the strongest signal
[13116.22s -> 13141.14s]  shrine nearby
[13141.14s -> 13148.88s]  Like this way. Yeah getting some effs. It should even out though. It should be okay in a few minutes
[13149.36s -> 13193.15s]  So it's this way. Is this am I going the right way here? That's not the right weapon. Let it go flint
[13209.02s -> 13223.84s]  I'm going right here. Yeah, it's gonna it's gonna be bad for a little bit. I really I have no idea why
[13225.23s -> 13229.90s]  Um, I don't know why i'd be
[13230.46s -> 13234.86s]  We were just fine for like almost four hours. Does this make any sense? Ah, I found it
[13235.58s -> 13249.07s]  Not a big deal. Yeah, it's all right
[13249.31s -> 13254.74s]  Yeah, I don't I really don't get it. It's so bizarre. So I did a 14 hour stream two days ago
[13255.63s -> 13261.02s]  I didn't drop one single frame streaming to the same server and now here we are
[13261.82s -> 13265.10s]  But not even what a day later a day and a half later
[13266.38s -> 13269.50s]  And just kind of shit in the bed now. It's weird. It doesn't make any sense
[13274.72s -> 13276.10s]  And it's
[13276.10s -> 13282.34s]  The it's not like oh, it's because it's eight o'clock and it's getting busy. I have a fiber to the house
[13283.52s -> 13285.52s]  So I don't share a connection with anybody
[13286.00s -> 13288.10s]  It doesn't make any sense
[13288.10s -> 13293.02s]  I don't get it. Okay. Uh, I am re da he
[13293.58s -> 13295.90s]  In the name of this, uh, I have a challenge for you
[13305.71s -> 13307.31s]  ISP throttle
[13307.31s -> 13313.07s]  I don't I mean I have a well, it's a 1000 up connection. I'm only using i'm not using that much
[13313.55s -> 13314.67s]  Six up
[13314.67s -> 13320.42s]  That's no no way. All right dump that in there
[13323.49s -> 13324.93s]  Oh cool
[13324.93s -> 13339.42s]  All right, so i'll probably have to uh, let's go somebody said rich andy
[13340.06s -> 13346.50s]  Uh, actually no like this connection. This is the dumbest thing about uh high speed internet
[13347.38s -> 13351.58s]  So this line is less than a hundred dollars a month
[13352.90s -> 13357.82s]  It's less than I think it's like 80 or I think it's like 80 bucks a month for this. I was paying
[13360.22s -> 13363.10s]  at the old place
[13363.10s -> 13369.28s]  Cox business internet. It was fucking it was like three or four hundred dollars a month and it was for a
[13370.34s -> 13386.10s]  20 times slower connection sharing with the whole neighborhood is fucking ridiculous. It's absolutely ridiculous and it was still shitty
[13386.10s -> 13392.80s]  Yep. Oh, yeah, did I just accidentally do this? I wasn't paying any attention. I think I just did it. Okay, cool
[13393.12s -> 13439.86s]  You see I think it looks like it's fine now, can I launch it? Wait, hold on. Um, what is that?
[13440.26s -> 13446.96s]  Why did that what was that for? Wait, wait, wait, hold on. I can stop the ball
[13447.52s -> 13538.46s]  Okay, so yeah, you don't like launch it you do launch it. Well, I just I was playing
[13538.94s -> 13553.84s]  Uh chess and I'm supposed to play checkers. I'm sitting thinking I gotta freeze it and then knock it three times
[13553.84s -> 13655.65s]  So yeah, that's my fault. How do I get that like this? Let's see. Laugh laugh. Go ahead. Laugh
[13655.89s -> 13672.14s]  What are you doing? I could have just grabbed the ledge. I could have done that
[13674.00s -> 13737.06s]  I actually could have done that and my nose right here is itchy. I'm sorry. I can't do it. Fuck this watch this fuck
[13737.54s -> 13746.62s]  That was I that was so close
[13760.43s -> 13767.44s]  I fucking had it. You saw it. It was right there. All right last try. I'm not doing this anymore
[13767.44s -> 13778.45s]  Who doesn't really matter? What do you mean? Eat it?
[13788.99s -> 13792.27s]  I have to do it. I have to do it. I'm not gonna leave till I do I don't care
[13792.51s -> 13794.03s]  I don't give a shit if this is the worst
[13794.03s -> 13816.75s]  Legend of Zelda place you've ever seen in your life. I don't care. I'm gonna get it. All right gonna run out of food
[13817.07s -> 13836.78s]  I'm gonna run out of food if i'm not careful. How did I get on the first time fuck i'm fucking done. I'm done
[13836.78s -> 13838.78s]  I'm done. I'm actually done. I'm not running
[13839.02s -> 13843.50s]  Fuck you. I had it. It was the first try and I landed if I rolled off like an idiot
[13843.82s -> 13874.29s]  I need to run and jump off and then get blown from behind. All right, i'm gonna get full health all that food wasted
[13874.77s -> 13888.00s]  Guys, i'll just rob a bunch of trolls and get another two pounds of apples. I'll be all right. Don't worry. Okay
[13888.40s -> 13928.77s]  Do I even need that chest go back and get it? I need to stay. Yeah, I know I need to stay
[13929.17s -> 13945.34s]  Whatever
[13945.34s -> 13951.92s]  So fucking impatient. I just want to get over there and open it
[14002.24s -> 14004.27s]  Okay now

[14036.26s -> 14039.86s]  Oh my god, how can one person be so such a fool?
[14040.42s -> 14067.23s]  How can one person be such a fool? Hurry up
[14100.24s -> 14118.56s]  Oh my god, this thing takes forever. I made it climbers bandana. Okay, that really was worth doing
[14120.77s -> 14134.00s]  Can this break this is definitely worth getting can you teleport me back to the beginning so I don't die?
[14142.70s -> 14159.06s]  Cool. All right, so now I can climb better armor never breaks. Cool. That was a cool shrine
[14161.74s -> 14168.64s]  Now where do I want to go? I could keep heading this way, right?
[14168.88s -> 14173.74s]  I would be surprised if there was a way to go up. So i'm gonna head towards the bridge
[14175.38s -> 14190.37s]  This way i'm just gonna keep keep heading over here. I probably should look for a fish, right?
[14190.45s -> 14192.37s]  This is probably the easiest thing to get
[14192.37s -> 14206.24s]  Never mind trying nearby
[14210.26s -> 14212.26s]  Not talking about that one, is it?

[14469.94s -> 14476.06s]  I definitely want the broadsword
[14476.06s -> 14479.34s]  Hot dogs are overrated. Ah, it depends on where you're getting them from

[15460.38s -> 15463.74s]  Just be like hey, um, is there anything I can even do about this or what?
[15465.39s -> 15467.15s]  It's so random
[15467.15s -> 15487.54s]  Pitchfork. Yeah, I I I cannot even I can't come up with the reason why this would ever be happening
[15488.26s -> 15490.26s]  I have fiber to the house
[15491.47s -> 15494.67s]  I will go at a thousand a thousand for 20 straight hours
[15495.47s -> 15497.47s]  and then just
[15498.11s -> 15501.87s]  It just does this for like an hour or two straight sometimes randomly for no reason
[15502.83s -> 15516.69s]  I don't know
[15516.69s -> 15525.87s]  Uh, yeah, i'm gonna heal. Okay, let me do this. Uh shrine
[15529.02s -> 15532.54s]  Save the game. There's no auto save
[15532.54s -> 15550.30s]  Looks like I saved it
[15550.30s -> 15571.41s]  Hey interesting
[15571.97s -> 15611.68s]  Plan pretty good plan. Hey
[15612.48s -> 15616.88s]  What why did it run out? What happened?
[15617.98s -> 15635.98s]  Did I not a stamina? What the hell just happened? That was gonna work. That was gonna actually work. That was gonna be fine
[15636.54s -> 15640.13s]  I ran this
[15640.13s -> 15642.77s]  All right. All right. I i'm gonna jump from here and just glide over it. Wait
[15643.78s -> 15645.78s]  Can I climb this and just do that instead?
[15651.55s -> 15665.22s]  No, that's definitely what that's what i'm doing. I probably don't have to go that high
[15666.34s -> 15668.34s]  There we go. Okay, so
[15668.66s -> 15714.59s]  I can't
[15714.59s -> 15725.33s]  Look at my hair. My hair's really kind of greasy today
[15726.05s -> 15742.27s]  Shouldn't be I washed it the water guides
[15762.08s -> 15764.48s]  Very cool
[15764.48s -> 15771.98s]  Uh, all right from here. Oh
[15773.02s -> 15783.82s]  That's neat. Why did I not die? Did I?
[15784.86s -> 15788.78s]  Why did I think that was ever going to be a thing that would work? I thought I could get around it
[15802.85s -> 15950.50s]  Ooh weird. Okay, fuck
[16036.46s -> 16039.82s]  I don't want to go. I just didn't want to run all the way back up here and do it
[16040.06s -> 16074.11s]  Uh, you know what i'm saying?
[16144.93s -> 16146.93s]  You fucking asshole
[16266.53s -> 16268.53s]  I'll dodge an axe if you swing it at me
[16268.98s -> 16281.44s]  I'm the I told you I'm smoking fucking cigarettes in the corner. I have to like get it at the right angle and freeze it
[16286.53s -> 16290.05s]  You know what I mean? I gotta it's gotta move and then I gotta freeze it
[16296.32s -> 16297.92s]  Yeah
[16297.92s -> 16308.98s]  Are we still dropping frames?
[16308.98s -> 16315.65s]  Is this still happening?
[16315.65s -> 16320.67s]  Yeah, god damn it. I don't get it
[16321.62s -> 16323.06s]  I don't understand
[16323.06s -> 16324.42s]  I don't get it
[16324.42s -> 16326.02s]  Doesn't make any sense
[16326.02s -> 16360.96s]  I need two more right? I like this aspect of the game. It's really cool. The shrines are
[16361.76s -> 16380.58s]  Some of my favorite part you like the worst part of the game. Really? I think it's really fun. I like it
[16390.59s -> 16404.32s]  Okay, so now I got this i gotta go up here. That's far away, but i'll make it i'll get a horse
[16404.64s -> 16446.05s]  Well, I gotta find a wild horse I get it's not just gonna happen. They're right here. I want the blue one
[16446.21s -> 16476.27s]  I'll take this one instead
[16499.26s -> 16514.50s]  Got it
[16514.74s -> 16517.39s]  What is that
[16517.39s -> 16519.39s]  What did I just do?
[16520.19s -> 16523.07s]  How do you ride the how do you actually ride the horse?
[16526.93s -> 16566.96s]  Is there a jump? I want to register this horse, please. I want to talk
[16569.02s -> 16571.02s]  Get back here come back back back back
[16585.28s -> 16587.76s]  I want to register this horse
[16604.22s -> 16623.34s]  Thank you. Jesus. Oh, okay. Yes 20 rupees saddle and riddle. Yeah, let's do it
[16623.98s -> 16639.50s]  I need a name. Um, I don't know. I'm gonna go pee. I haven't peed in like five hours
[16642.03s -> 16646.46s]  Pee, all right pee break and we'll come back and you'll see what the horse is named
[16650.54s -> 16691.89s]  In the meantime the stream might f for a second. Well, I do a test of some sort right back. Yeah, I don't understand
[16692.21s -> 16702.70s]  So I just i'm doing speed test right now. I have I mean it's maybe that it's a stable
[16703.96s -> 16713.90s]  900 up I gotta talk to somebody at data twitch bad and I actually have to do it now because I don't
[16714.78s -> 16719.66s]  Something about where my connection is hopping from vegas to the servers. I go to it's just
[16720.30s -> 16732.26s]  Something happens all the time and it I don't think it can't be something on my end
[16733.26s -> 16739.73s]  It's hard to determine that because two days ago I streamed for 14 hours and we didn't drop one frame not one
[16741.18s -> 16746.69s]  Same time frame two same time friday night. It's not like oh, yeah
[16746.77s -> 16749.17s]  You're streaming on like a wednesday at two o'clock in the morning
[16749.17s -> 16757.23s]  I mean that was friday at eight nine ten o'clock at night not one frame here. We are sunday night and
[16758.82s -> 16765.98s]  For what for four hours is not a single frame. It's just bizarre and then it's oh
[16766.70s -> 16770.70s]  Now all of a sudden you're just going to start dropping packets to twitch
[16771.81s -> 16780.24s]  Why go pee? No, I will I will but just so it doesn't make any sense right like
[16780.80s -> 16783.52s]  Okay, if I was consistently having internet problems, that would make sense
[16783.92s -> 16789.87s]  But you can't have a stream go flawlessly for four hours and then randomly at like 8 15
[16790.51s -> 16793.30s]  It's just oh now everything sucks
[16793.30s -> 16797.46s]  And if I do a speed test or if I do like an upload test, it's like no your connection is perfectly normal
[16798.35s -> 16800.59s]  It's the it's the data leaving here
[16801.31s -> 16802.83s]  from vegas
[16802.83s -> 16806.51s]  It's hitting some point some hop in a trace route, right if you did one
[16806.99s -> 16810.67s]  And it's just junking up somewhere on the road at some point. I don't get it
[16810.99s -> 17216.88s]  I don't know, but i'm gonna go pee i'll be right back. Okay, i'm back
[17219.41s -> 17225.26s]  Looks like I didn't drop a frame while I was gone. It's kind of strange
[17228.00s -> 17266.10s]  Okay, sorry. I scared you frank. Do I like it? I the game is great. Yeah, okay
[17266.10s -> 17279.76s]  Can horses die can a horse die? So if I go out with this horse, can I the horse die? Okay?
[17280.24s -> 17296.22s]  I'm kind of concerned about that. Be honest. Okay, so I need to go from here. We need to go straight
[17296.86s -> 17304.99s]  Right. I'm just gonna go on the road
[17306.99s -> 17332.53s]  How do you turn? Yeah, this is this is nice. It's a good looking horse. Okay. Here's a uh, this is this bridge out
[17333.17s -> 17336.16s]  Acarico bridge
[17336.16s -> 17362.85s]  Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Okay. I'm almost there. It's pretty cool. See i'm petting the horse. I'm fine
[17379.02s -> 17381.02s]  I'm sad. I ran over a
[17381.66s -> 17390.48s]  Animal can you is there no jumping with the horse bones actually
[17406.85s -> 17408.85s]  It's automatic jumping okay
[17422.90s -> 17428.35s]  Turning is hard
[17428.35s -> 17430.35s]  Go what's wrong?
[17435.84s -> 17443.15s]  Okay, go back go back you walked past broccoli man. Who's broccoli man?
[17445.30s -> 17447.46s]  Go go you walked past broccoli man
[17449.44s -> 17451.44s]  That's broccoli man. Okay
[17462.64s -> 17466.74s]  Do this, okay
[17466.74s -> 17468.48s]  You can see me
[17468.48s -> 17479.28s]  I can see you. Oh, i'm hestu and I need your this is okay where we bring this stuff
[17479.68s -> 17496.88s]  I can't use my powers without them
[17496.88s -> 17501.65s]  Please please get my maracas back from them. You got it
[17545.65s -> 17547.65s]  I was trying to ram. I was trying to ram
[17555.09s -> 17559.73s]  Is that not okay? This the horse is causing all kinds of problems. I'm gonna get off the horse
[17560.29s -> 17567.39s]  I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that twice
[17579.26s -> 17581.26s]  It's i'm trying so hard to turn
[17582.72s -> 17585.76s]  You know what? Just hang it out here. You're fine. Just just chill out there. We'll be good
[17588.02s -> 17590.02s]  Got a little bit of business to take care of. Oh, yeah escape
[17591.81s -> 17629.81s]  I spit everywhere. I
[17630.45s -> 17639.09s]  I just so impatient
[17639.17s -> 17642.21s]  Lock on it's the I I want to be able to just
[17643.09s -> 17645.09s]  Attack, you know what I mean?
[17648.56s -> 17652.32s]  Give me this. I this thing fuck this thing. Give me this thing way better
[17654.29s -> 17663.89s]  I'm using an actual item
[17680.02s -> 17683.07s]  There we go
[17683.07s -> 17689.58s]  Use spells. What spell would you want me to use freeze one?
[17692.27s -> 17703.50s]  Ooh
[17703.50s -> 17709.81s]  Pyromancy, okay. Hestu's maracas. This game is sick
[17713.57s -> 17717.17s]  Okay, let me let me take a quick look and see what I would rate this right now out of 10
[17717.89s -> 17720.83s]  I probably would give it like a four
[17720.83s -> 17741.52s]  Yeah, I mean the only reason it's not getting a zero is so people don't get really mad when I give it a low score
[17742.27s -> 17749.20s]  I think a four is okay
[17749.20s -> 17768.37s]  But no, this is really fun. I like it a lot. This is this definitely it's pretty high
[17768.93s -> 17771.98s]  so far
[17771.98s -> 17775.10s]  It's just really fun. It's it's there's lots of fun things to do
[17781.15s -> 17782.83s]  Here are your maracas
[17782.83s -> 17786.30s]  Can we get a number that why would you want a number?
[17789.70s -> 17791.81s]  It's definitely better than the eight
[17791.81s -> 17797.36s]  It's 100 higher than an eight. It's somewhere between eight and ten. I just don't know which I don't know where
[17797.84s -> 17814.05s]  I need to keep going. This game is objectively better than elden ring. We'll see. I don't know
[17820.03s -> 17828.85s]  Inventory expansion. That's a huge deal. I have one
[17836.48s -> 17844.03s]  um, yeah
[17844.03s -> 17855.15s]  Oh, definitely weapon, right? I keep having so much trouble. I have so much trouble with weapons. No frames dropped either
[17857.01s -> 17859.01s]  In the last like 10 minutes
[17861.14s -> 17863.14s]  Is there scientists that we can explain how that's possible?
[17868.03s -> 17869.23s]  Okay
[17869.23s -> 17871.23s]  da na na na na
[17874.11s -> 17892.93s]  The weapon stash has been expanded good to know that's where I need to mark this, right?
[17893.17s -> 17901.18s]  Okay, i'm gonna stamp this a pin here. Yeah, I need to put a pin here. Uh, i'm gonna say this is
[17901.82s -> 17912.69s]  Uh this right? Okay, let's keep going. Are you gonna collect all 900 seeds?
[17914.83s -> 17919.87s]  I would be happy if I were to get the first boss on stream
[17920.51s -> 17924.08s]  Be real
[17924.80s -> 17931.98s]  I don't you guys all right. It's been it's been about five hours of this game. It's time to do the uh, the poll
[17934.66s -> 17937.30s]  Vote if you do you want to see more?
[17937.86s -> 17941.95s]  Elders I really almost said elden ring. Do you want to see more?
[17942.51s -> 17943.87s]  Breath of the wild
[17943.87s -> 17948.11s]  Would you like me to keep playing this? Would you like me to be what this what I play when I stream again?
[17949.82s -> 17953.50s]  Like the next stream the next stream that you see on this channel. Do you want it to be this?
[17960.32s -> 17963.34s]  We need a poll
[17963.34s -> 17969.47s]  Well, the one is yes two is no do you want this to be the next thing that I play like
[17970.19s -> 17973.58s]  On the next stream just keep going
[17973.66s -> 17976.94s]  A lot of people were I mean no internet problems probably uh booted a lot of you guys
[17976.94s -> 17981.74s]  But there were a lot of people here tonight a surprising amount of people so
[17982.86s -> 17984.86s]  You guys like it. I'll definitely keep playing it
[17987.76s -> 17990.24s]  I like it. So if you guys like it, then why not?
[17997.26s -> 18002.96s]  Yeah, use the pole load on that pole drying somewhere
[18003.84s -> 18017.14s]  Oh, this is kakariko village
[18017.14s -> 18027.28s]  Travel i'm sorry, but I seem to have twisted my ankle. All right. Sorry. You had to see me like that
[18029.25s -> 18033.81s]  Say traveler
[18033.81s -> 18042.29s]  Where'd you get that object hanging from your waist? I found it. I'm the dead guy that I killed
[18043.25s -> 18053.70s]  Okay, we've been waiting for you for a very long time. I must insist that you meet with our leader
[18054.34s -> 18063.76s]  Lady impa lady impa's house is below lantern falls just over there
[18065.39s -> 18072.11s]  In any case, it was a real honor to meet you. Nice to meet you, too
[18074.64s -> 18076.64s]  They probably have a shrine in here
[18076.96s -> 18078.96s]  Somewhere right I imagine
[18079.20s -> 18087.58s]  I want to do that for I like the shrines the most
[18089.58s -> 18091.82s]  Wow, that's a lot. That's 90. Damn
[18092.54s -> 18095.73s]  I cannot deny that
[18095.73s -> 18098.93s]  I can't deny that that's way too high to deny
[18100.27s -> 18111.89s]  Uh, so we're gonna keep playing breath of the wild. There's 120 shrines in the game
[18114.14s -> 18125.55s]  Wow
[18125.55s -> 18127.55s]  Yes, it looks like everybody voted
[18129.45s -> 18131.45s]  4 000 of you
[18131.47s -> 18138.10s]  89 said to play more. Um, but breath of the wild nice
[18142.75s -> 18145.31s]  Okay, that's uh, i'm i'm excited. I think
[18160.70s -> 18162.14s]  Why did I pretend to like it?
[18162.14s -> 18169.25s]  I'm gonna just break my switch with a hammer and then show everybody on twitter be like, I don't know
[18169.25s -> 18177.39s]  I dropped my switch. I fucking shattered. I have to play, uh multiverses instead shield of the mind's eye
[18177.95s -> 18201.15s]  Stop closing my stuff. I want hot mic hot mic
[18209.09s -> 18210.69s]  No, actually, i'm happy
[18210.69s -> 18215.73s]  It's a micro boss micro boss
[18219.06s -> 18221.06s]  Finally, I unlocked the dodge roll
[18223.95s -> 18247.71s]  Oh my god, finally. Wait, did I have it the whole time lorry rush?
[18248.43s -> 18259.06s]  What I didn't that's new
[18262.45s -> 18265.09s]  Do a backflip to avoid enemy attacks and create an opening to strike back
[18269.90s -> 18272.58s]  Yeah back pedal
[18272.58s -> 18278.78s]  I should probably not be using this
[18279.42s -> 18281.42s]  I hit the wrong button. I'm
[18281.42s -> 18283.18s]  Again, i'll say this again
[18283.18s -> 18287.50s]  I hate so badly that all the controllers like across the consoles the controllers are different
[18288.38s -> 18294.42s]  Like i'm pressing where b is on xbox and b is like I wish it was just universal
[18306.30s -> 18308.94s]  Button law. Yeah button rant. I know that's what i'm saying
[18312.45s -> 18315.60s]  It should be
[18315.60s -> 18316.80s]  You know what i'm saying?
[18316.80s -> 18323.65s]  Wait, I can parry at the right time
[18323.73s -> 18328.72s]  Well, I need a shield equipped first of all
[18328.80s -> 18342.19s]  Why am I forgetting how to play? Okay. Oh, it's because okay, right right right right right because I have this um
[18342.75s -> 18357.60s]  equipped
[18357.60s -> 18362.30s]  Am I a man or am I a muppet a muppet of a man?
[18362.94s -> 18376.13s]  Where's my inventory?
[18376.13s -> 18376.93s]  Cool
[18376.93s -> 18378.93s]  Uh, something's moving around my mouth
[18394.11s -> 18428.43s]  Guardian sword. Oh, hell. Yeah, i'm gonna store this for like 10 hours. I'm chewing my lip off camera. I'm sorry

[18522.43s -> 18530.61s]  I'm gonna stream for a little while like at least another hour or two. Maybe omega gaming weekend
[18530.93s -> 18538.82s]  I think we're gonna stop playing during omega gaming weekend

[18773.57s -> 18776.29s]  These words which the princess risked her life to leave you
[18777.18s -> 18781.20s]  Well, if you are to hear them, you must be prepared to risk your life as well
[18781.44s -> 18787.46s]  I'm afraid that burden may be too much to bear while you are still without your memories
[18787.78s -> 18793.14s]  I'll leave the choice to you when you feel you are ready to receive the princess's message returned to me

[18838.51s -> 18844.11s]  calamity ganon a primal evil that has endured over the ages
[18844.75s -> 18849.94s]  This evil has been turned back time and again
[18852.11s -> 18857.79s]  The soul of a hero and a princess who carries the blood of the goddess
[18858.43s -> 18865.92s]  with the passage of time
[18866.40s -> 18870.24s]  Each conflict with ganon faded into legend
[18871.20s -> 18874.48s]  So listen closely as I tell you of this
[18874.94s -> 18879.14s]  Legend that occurred 10,000 years ago
[18882.35s -> 18884.35s]  What are the words? What's the secret sentence?
[18884.91s -> 18907.44s]  Was then their technological prowess to ensure the safety of the land

[18927.70s -> 18932.50s]  They also built a region of autonomous weapons
[18933.06s -> 18953.31s]  Called guardians those are things that I was fighting the shoot lasers was for
[18953.95s -> 18960.79s]  Where's my little fairy friend? No, but that's the one with the elmo voice
[18998.91s -> 19000.91s]  Music's pretty uh
[19002.99s -> 19006.19s]  The darkness delivered his final blow
[19006.91s -> 19011.23s]  The princess used her sacred power to seal away
[19011.93s -> 19032.78s]  calamity ganon
[19032.78s -> 19046.42s]  Okay, we strove to follow the lead of our ancestors of 10,000 years prior. Okay, but in the end
[19046.90s -> 19056.10s]  Despite our best efforts and careful planning we underestimated his power in order to avoid making that grave mistake again
[19056.42s -> 19060.03s]  The princess left you these words
[19064.53s -> 19069.15s]  Free the four divine beasts is what she said
[19074.19s -> 19075.63s]  What the heck?

[19109.01s -> 19114.55s]  And the divine beast va neboros controlled by urbosa of the gerudo
[19116.78s -> 19120.06s]  Extremely ill-advised to face ganon without the power of the divine beast to help you
[19121.09s -> 19126.05s]  You must infiltrate the divine beast that were stolen away by ganon 100 years ago and bring them back to our side
[19126.75s -> 19133.95s]  Or hold left trigger and step forward hold left trigger step forward and teleport across the entire game

[19300.91s -> 19306.34s]  We must make sure the outsider doesn't learn the location of the fountain or the two shrines near it
[19309.58s -> 19312.38s]  That new guy in town looks like he really knows how to tune a bow
[19312.78s -> 19324.53s]  I hope he comes by and knocks an arrow for me. It's been way too long. I'm just gonna read this
[19327.12s -> 19335.78s]  All right. Let's check. Where's that? I want another shrine. Okay

[19833.34s -> 19836.54s]  Essentially, I was drinking pee because I was trying to be my own filter
[19837.50s -> 19840.09s]  Um my own water filter
[19840.09s -> 19845.45s]  Oh speaking of water filters. This is weird. I was gonna tweet this but I didn't because it was kind of odd

[22628.60s -> 22630.68s]  Um like this could I do like this?
[22636.52s -> 22639.29s]  What happens if I do that?
[22639.29s -> 22640.65s]  carrots and
[22640.65s -> 22646.03s]  flowers
[22646.03s -> 22647.79s]  fried wild greens
[22647.79s -> 22650.54s]  Cool. No

[22693.37s -> 22697.07s]  so if I do a mushroom
[22697.07s -> 22698.51s]  and this
[22698.51s -> 22700.83s]  then i'll have food that heals me and

[22750.11s -> 22752.83s]  It's sheep cheese. I did that sheep is not a goat
[22754.72s -> 22758.32s]  The sheep is not a goat. Do you need what do we need to go over the animals again?

[22806.99s -> 22809.74s]  Point of interest. What's this?
[22810.38s -> 22831.74s]  Kind of got hit once. Is it an emulator?
[22846.89s -> 22851.36s]  Um, I can sleep in here. Is there a chest or anything?
[22851.84s -> 22854.44s]  What is diary?
[22854.44s -> 22862.30s]  Ancient text when a dark light resides in the cursed statue's eyes pierce its gaze to purge the seal from the shrine
[22862.46s -> 22875.80s]  Good to know the reason to use an emulator is for 4k 60 fps texture packs
[22892.89s -> 22898.11s]  Okay, let me guess you caught one of the great dr
[22898.17s -> 22903.61s]  Calypso's groundbreaking research and just had to meet him for yourself. Huh? No, don't tell me you never heard of me

[22925.32s -> 22929.42s]  Everyone forgets i'm a doctor for some reason
[22929.66s -> 22936.46s]  And since you asked i'll inform you that i'm engaged in analyzing ancient texts. I've been time for idle chit chat
[22950.36s -> 22960.40s]  doctor calip
[22971.92s -> 22986.57s]  Who's he talking to my mom my mom's watching right now. I have her
[22987.37s -> 22988.97s]  Text her right here
[22988.97s -> 22992.89s]  He's my mom doesn't know how to use twitch chat. So she chats
[22993.85s -> 22995.85s]  Right with but with text
[22996.25s -> 22997.77s]  She texts me
[22997.77s -> 23022.60s]  And I use that as a chat

[23031.76s -> 23035.61s]  What's the last thing she said?
[23035.61s -> 23037.79s]  Don't listen to them, sweetheart
[23037.85s -> 23040.35s]  McDonald's is delicious. We're a mcdonald's family
[23041.15s -> 23048.38s]  All the way through I never used to cook with goat cheese because it was disgusting cheddar cheese where it's at
[23048.94s -> 23053.58s]  Love mom. Yeah
[23053.58s -> 23056.70s]  Monka s she said monka s like five times before that. I don't know what she meant
[23057.58s -> 23066.12s]  Yeah, they're like
[23066.12s -> 23068.52s]  30 to 40 minutes apart each one like six times
[23072.81s -> 23074.81s]  Okay, so uh, yeah
[23074.89s -> 23102.73s]  If I don't have a bow equipped why not dude if I if I was an adventurer I definitely would use a bow 100
[23115.34s -> 23153.21s]  What if you get attacked up close good luck. Oh shit. Here we go. He's making noises

[23187.79s -> 23195.37s]  I'm still good
[23195.37s -> 23212.22s]  Seven hours or so maybe seven and a half hours something like that. You're addicted. It's a good. It's a fun game
[23213.69s -> 23216.01s]  It's genuinely a fun game. It's very nice
[23220.51s -> 23235.53s]  What's that
[23235.53s -> 23239.23s]  Oh, it's an acorn
[23239.23s -> 23246.11s]  You said that yesterday and I left and you stream for another nine hours. Yeah, that was a rare occasion though
[23248.19s -> 23255.64s]  Where's the tower here?
[23255.64s -> 23257.64s]  Uh, i'm gonna keep wandering this way
[23261.98s -> 23270.01s]  Oh, hi, you should join the yiga clan. You don't know. I mean I do know
[23272.49s -> 23275.05s]  Brave group of warriors founded by master
[23275.53s -> 23330.89s]  Koga and dedicated defending a hero throughout long. Why I didn't hit family guy death pose
[23331.29s -> 23347.85s]  I should have just fought that was weird. I thought I could just boom just blow them crazy
[23347.93s -> 23355.77s]  They fly and you know, I guess you can't is that just a random occurrence? That's pretty cool
[23356.33s -> 23372.27s]  I just missed. Yeah, I felt like it could have hit though
[23375.85s -> 23396.56s]  Right on top of it. Your skin suit looks accurate to a human today. Thanks
[23397.44s -> 23406.72s]  No, never mind. I'm not gonna do that weird

[23455.92s -> 23457.40s]  Box
[23457.40s -> 23461.16s]  And see whether you know the 10 to 25 million dollars I probably would need
[23462.35s -> 23473.92s]  For like a month
[23473.92s -> 23487.10s]  Oh, I can't carry any more melee weapons. I have a lot of these claim wars. I'll just get rid of it
[23487.66s -> 23493.08s]  Uh, that thing's 18 damage 16 damage
[23511.12s -> 23530.54s]  shit

[23605.34s -> 23608.54s]  I'm doing dark souls controls. I keep on hitting right stick to try to lock on
[23650.28s -> 23657.93s]  These guys are way higher level than me. Oh my god. I'm just fucking running. What's the point help?
[23659.45s -> 23660.89s]  What's happening
[23660.89s -> 23664.04s]  Is there stuff on your cart? Do you have stuff on your cart?
[23666.12s -> 23675.10s]  What the fuck is going on? This isn't supposed to be hard. You die in one swing. What do you mean?
[23675.10s -> 23679.56s]  It's not hard. Okay, I die in one hit with my nintendo switch

[23742.41s -> 23747.18s]  I'm trying to do the flurry dodge. Whatever. I have a better idea
[23749.53s -> 23752.49s]  Go put on something that is made out of anything besides
[23753.85s -> 23755.93s]  Like something that I got it fucking old navy
[23764.88s -> 23781.16s]  Goodbye fuck out of here

[23835.64s -> 23853.04s]  Okay, i'm not gonna glide
[23853.44s -> 23862.72s]  I would not have made it
[23862.72s -> 23873.28s]  Do you enjoy the scenery? It's beautiful. The 30 fps is not a big deal. It's doable. It's workable. It's fine. I think it's fine
[23880.08s -> 23884.49s]  Who's the sniff guy?
[23903.53s -> 23929.95s]  Mop
[23929.95s -> 23938.54s]  slide

[24089.15s -> 24097.29s]  I don't I I don't have to go around. I bet you I can stand up here right there
[24097.61s -> 24145.13s]  Come on. I have to go all the way around. I just should have died
[24145.45s -> 24152.24s]  I probably would have ended up up there again. All right, I think I can get this here we go
[24154.11s -> 24171.98s]  Don't do the jump thing. That'd be fine. Yeah, I can definitely make it from here. Oh my god. That's a lot

[24352.17s -> 24356.89s]  I'm so screwed though. I need to somehow get back up the whole mountain
[24357.13s -> 24376.96s]  Is this I could probably teleport and then go again. What would this be for?
[24377.76s -> 24383.07s]  What's what is this for?
[24383.45s -> 24386.73s]  Wouldn't just be here for no reason. I have to set it back in the slot

[24530.32s -> 24533.52s]  It's not like the the handle of a fridge
[24535.66s -> 24562.25s]  Or a tire iron
[24562.25s -> 24570.25s]  Pure offense. Yeah
[24570.25s -> 24575.04s]  These guys do so much the huge guys don't do that much damage
[24576.97s -> 24577.93s]  those
[24577.93s -> 24579.29s]  the blue
