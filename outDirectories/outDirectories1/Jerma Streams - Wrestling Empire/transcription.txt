[60.09s -> 70.01s]  Hello, how you doing? Welcome to another edition of streaming with Jeremy.
[70.01s -> 80.82s]  Right, people don't know the real spelling of my name. Jeremy. A-E-R-I-M.
[80.82s -> 89.00s]  Hello, yeah, I'm on the toilet. Uh, sorry, I feel like every time I stream now,
[89.82s -> 95.66s]  I have like an opening with an apology video. Hey, sorry buddy, sorry that like the stream's
[95.66s -> 99.50s]  like three hours late. Uh, sorry that the stream's like two days late. Hey, sorry, guys, sorry about
[99.50s -> 106.42s]  this. But that, I'm gonna, let's go over this, because people, I don't want anyone to be
[106.42s -> 110.74s]  concerned. I don't want anyone to be annoyed. Uh, although I can't really control that 100%,
[110.74s -> 116.06s]  but I'm gonna, let's just let, here we go. Uh, I kind of fucked myself up the last few days.
[116.70s -> 124.09s]  I'm doing some new stretches and some new yoga moves to help with the chest and spine pain.
[125.34s -> 132.94s]  And, um, I kind of got locked up in the middle of one, and I kind of fucked myself up.
[134.47s -> 143.02s]  So, that was fun. Can you fart? I mean, my body is physically capable of doing it,
[143.02s -> 159.51s]  but I'm not gonna do it for you. All the exercise is killing you. No, there's so many theories as to
[159.51s -> 168.49s]  why or what I did, I don't know. But, I, my like back and like shoulder area, kind of in the middle
[168.49s -> 175.37s]  of my back, straight through where like the rib cage is, on the right side, I think I like pulled
[175.37s -> 181.29s]  something or pinched something trying to do some of these yoga moves. It's like, that's just funny
[181.29s -> 188.89s]  on its own. Like, I'm the old fat guy that does the yoga shit and like goes to the hospital,
[188.89s -> 193.05s]  like hurts himself, of course. I didn't, I didn't go to the hospital, let's be never really clear.
[194.01s -> 202.79s]  Um, but yeah, I'm trying to do it. I'm trying to move some of the muscle and the tissue around
[202.79s -> 210.71s]  this area. Again, if you don't know, if I, I'll say it again, I have a three year going on
[210.71s -> 214.95s]  a chronic pain problem that I'm still trying to figure out exactly why it's happening.
[215.67s -> 222.39s]  And, yada, yada, yada, x, y, z. Okay, let's go, let's stream. Here we are.
[225.85s -> 235.98s]  You're practicing the sit and reach. I still don't, I get it, but I still don't get it,
[235.98s -> 239.66s]  if that makes any sense. Anyways, today we're gonna play a game that I've wanted to play for
[239.66s -> 246.90s]  a very long time. And weirdly enough, the guy that made this game remade it this year and it
[246.90s -> 253.40s]  came out like seven days ago. Uh, those who know the M. Dickie games, I've always heard about them,
[253.40s -> 259.00s]  but I never played them. There's been a lot of requests to play Wrestling Revolution 3D
[259.64s -> 264.01s]  and I took a look at the trailer. I've looked at a little bit of shit about it. Don't want to
[264.01s -> 274.02s]  get too into it. Um, it looked insane, but he remade it. This is Wrestling Empire. I guess he,
[274.66s -> 282.65s]  remastered it. So I was like, oh fuck, well, I'll just wait for that one. And here it is. So
[282.65s -> 288.50s]  there's, I don't know about character customization. I don't know if we can make a character, but
[289.30s -> 293.78s]  in the last day or two, just kind of poking around, I've edited a few people. So I think
[293.78s -> 300.18s]  we're going to pick a character that we want to be and edit that character and play as that
[300.18s -> 314.44s]  character in career mode. This game is fucking rad. I've, I've heard about it, but I have never
[314.44s -> 322.94s]  experienced it. So we're going to experience it together. And it's weird because I looked at
[322.94s -> 328.62s]  the control scheme of this game. I opened the tutorial and just looked at it and kind of walked
[328.62s -> 333.72s]  around a little bit and I'm just like, holy shit. This is, this is, it's like no mercy. This reminds
[333.72s -> 340.20s]  me of the old N64 games with the grapple. And then you're in a grapple and you hit up, uh, attack,
[340.20s -> 346.06s]  down attack, left attack. This feels very no mercy to me. And if this is the closest thing that I can
[346.06s -> 363.96s]  get to no mercy, then this is going to be one of my favorite games. Important is your surgery
[363.96s -> 369.32s]  before the big stream. Well, I don't, sorry. That's why I was like quiet. I was like silent,
[369.32s -> 379.96s]  just reading. Oh, I fucking back. Anyways, um, no, I don't have a surgery on schedule yet.
[380.52s -> 385.48s]  That's something that I haven't, I have another doctor's appointment in a week and we're going
[385.48s -> 391.32s]  to go over the timeframe of when that will happen because there is a lot of major projects going on
[391.32s -> 401.90s]  that I don't like that. I'm not going to just cancel scream it. No, but anyways, let's go. I'm
[401.90s -> 406.14s]  ready. I hope this is not DMCA. Tell me immediately if it is, we're going to find out right now. Is
[406.14s -> 421.03s]  this DMCA claimable? Yes, it is. So I'm going to try to find a way to, uh, I'm pretty sure this is
[421.03s -> 425.59s]  like a song. All right. We're going to make a character. We need a career mode. I'm not going
[425.59s -> 430.18s]  to tell you guys very much about this because I don't know much about it either. Let's go over
[430.18s -> 438.42s]  here. So this is M Dickie's wrestling revolution. And I know there's a lot of unlockable characters.
[438.98s -> 447.18s]  Is it not? Is this okay? I'll go. I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll be fine. All right. So where am I? Who
[447.18s -> 454.23s]  should I pick? All right. I made this guy. I made craft Ben. Uh, I made smoke. Uh, what else did I
[454.23s -> 462.52s]  make? I made like one or two people just messing around in the creator. Who do I, what, what does
[462.52s -> 471.91s]  the, okay. So there's green, this pink, and then there's purple pink. What are the different colors
[471.91s -> 486.23s]  mean? It looks like pink is women. What is the purple? Oh, it's, it's heel and face. Oh, shit.
[486.23s -> 498.01s]  Okay. Well, what, what, what do we want to play as? Should we play? I don't, I, I don't want to play
[498.01s -> 511.18s]  as smoke. I just made this guy in like 10 minutes for fun. I play as smoke, but I, I don't, I don't,
[511.18s -> 516.57s]  I wanted to make a character on stream. I don't want to just play as this guy for my career.
[517.21s -> 527.38s]  All right. Well, we have to make him less popular because that's too popular. He has to have a
[527.38s -> 540.81s]  fucking C-minus in every ability. EMCA, whatever. Look, what about attitude? Should I put that
[540.81s -> 549.82s]  somewhere? No, we're making our own character. No, no, no. We'll have plenty of interactions with
[549.82s -> 560.98s]  smoke over the next two days. Okay. Who should I, okay. I want to be a, I want to be a heel.
[560.98s -> 571.96s]  How about heckle horn? I'm just going to recreate them anyways. Heel or face? Which one? I think I
[571.96s -> 589.06s]  want to be a heel. All right. I'm going to be heel. Let's, let's, let's edit heckle horn. Okay.
[589.06s -> 591.86s]  I'm going to change that name. Let's all right with the theme music. What do we got?
[592.50s -> 612.58s]  There'd be wicked fast cartoon clown sounds. I kind of like that. Enos music. You could slow
[612.58s -> 629.26s]  it down too though. Hold on. That's pretty, I like that too. Yeah. This like kind of, this like sucks
[629.26s -> 639.56s]  at like 80%. You actually doesn't, what do you mean suck? This sounds awesome. It's not like
[639.56s -> 647.67s]  I'm underwater. Yeah. I'm keeping that one. The name's got to change, but all right. Pyro,
[647.67s -> 652.15s]  fireworks, fountains, smoke or full works? All right. We're doing full fireworks.
[653.11s -> 661.77s]  Do I come in with a prop? Microphone, camera, bell, explosive, explosive,
[667.56s -> 677.69s]  baseball bat, chair. Why would I come in with a grenade? What the fuck? All right. How about
[677.69s -> 681.77s]  baseball bat? All right. Let me ask you guys. How popular do you think I am?
[683.16s -> 688.07s]  No, no, not just talking about twitch.tv. I'm talking about all everywhere. 60% popular,
[689.03s -> 698.62s]  70% popular, 40% popular. How popular do you think I am? No, no, no. Household name is like,
[698.62s -> 708.63s]  is at least 95%. No way. And if you really think about it outside of like the twitch sphere of
[708.63s -> 715.67s]  content creators and community members, it's probably like this in like the grand scheme of
[715.67s -> 728.07s]  things. Uh, but you're the sus guy. All right. You know what? That bumps you up at least a few
[728.07s -> 736.01s]  points. We'll just, let's do 65%. How does that sound? Strength? It's pretty bad, but no,
[736.01s -> 738.25s]  I don't want to be like a piece of shit. I wouldn't really actually play the game.
[740.71s -> 747.70s]  My mom knows you exist, but that's because it's your mother and you probably talk about me at
[747.70s -> 754.10s]  dinner. You probably like do the sus face at dinner with, with like fucking green beans in
[754.10s -> 768.73s]  your mouth and your mother's probably sick of it. I, uh, 67% strength, 68% strength, 70% skill.
[768.73s -> 776.26s]  Uh, I think I'm, I think I am kind of skilled in a way. Now we'll do 70. Uh, it's going to,
[776.26s -> 781.06s]  oh no, hold on. I don't want to be, it's going to be, it's going to be hard if I don't do it.
[781.78s -> 785.66s]  My dad watched your spore stream and thought you were stupid.
[791.56s -> 800.33s]  Whatever. That your dad had one small example of my stream. I'm going to put skill up to like
[800.33s -> 805.77s]  78 and agility down and the stamina is going way down, but no, I, it's going to stay at 65.
[806.49s -> 814.90s]  That looks good. My attitude is very good. I'd say it's 80%. My added, I have a very good attitude.
[814.90s -> 827.03s]  I do 82%, 80%. Okay. Now we can, can we get, I got to get off this like song. All right. Build.
[827.93s -> 837.74s]  Yeah. Okay. 26. That's Oh, old. Can you go and go to a hundred? Who'd be wrestling at a hundred?
[837.74s -> 857.99s]  All right. We're going to just do me. Okay. Whatever. Four, six, two, seven, 10, four, six.
[863.45s -> 874.49s]  No, we're going to be, I'm doing me. That's so skinny. That's how much I actually weigh though.
[874.49s -> 884.87s]  All right. Can I like beef it up just for the fiction? Why is there a five, eight emote?
[884.87s -> 896.60s]  Whose emote is that? Why do they have that muscle mass? It used to be all right. I even, okay. Even
[896.60s -> 902.44s]  though over the years I've dropped a lot of the muscle from when I was working out, like
[902.44s -> 909.64s]  medical bullshit, I still got pretty big ass arms. And I'm not just saying that I got, my arms are
[909.64s -> 913.72s]  pretty fucking large and you've seen them and you know, that's never, that's never going away.
[919.94s -> 926.97s]  I think that's fair. I got big ass arms and big ass shoulders. All right. I'm okay with that.
[928.57s -> 935.61s]  I have like a tiny little waist, a huge ass, huge shoulders and big biceps and tiny forearms.
[936.09s -> 948.71s]  I look like an ant. I fucking, like a weird endomorphic ant body. Okay. That looks good.
[950.14s -> 961.38s]  Uh, hair. I'll change this. Um, hairstyle one, hairstyle. Oh, there's different variations too.
[961.38s -> 970.15s]  Hold on. Let's, let's go to a variation. All right. That's kind of accurate. If I got a haircut,
[970.15s -> 980.50s]  this is what it would look like. That's why I'm afraid to get a haircut. Why am I turning this
[980.50s -> 984.26s]  way? Oh, there we go. Honeytail middle. No, I don't want a low ponytail.
[984.26s -> 1002.73s]  All right. That's, that's not bad. It's not EMCA. I don't know what to do. Look, uh,
[1006.42s -> 1009.70s]  well, look, well, and you know what? At this point, I've played this song like
[1009.70s -> 1017.22s]  eight times already. It's been played like 10 times. What? Oh, I make sure you mute it after
[1017.22s -> 1025.38s]  the 11th, 12th time it plays on stream. I'm already fucked if it's here. I think you swag
[1025.38s -> 1035.27s]  land gaming for the five community subs. Appreciate it. Yeah. At this point, like if
[1035.27s -> 1041.64s]  you robbed the bank, like you go and it's like, oh, I'm going to rob the bank. I was like,
[1041.64s -> 1048.12s]  there are the registers open. You don't go, you know, I'll take a $5 bill. Oh, I've just robbed
[1048.12s -> 1062.42s]  the bank. I'm already robbing the bank. So I'm already here. He admits he's a criminal.
[1062.42s -> 1076.23s]  So you're going to rob the bank. You might as well go rob the bank in a Cadillac. No,
[1076.23s -> 1081.59s]  that's what I'm saying. I'm saying like, if the bank is already being robbed, you're not going to
[1081.59s -> 1107.11s]  ask for like $1.50 in quarters, which I have to shave like the top of my head. What is this
[1107.11s -> 1116.79s]  shaving? All right. My hair is kind of like, all right, that's kind of like Lego hair, right?
[1116.79s -> 1126.47s]  Everybody says I have. It's your bulge. I thought you were serious. I was like, oh shit. It's like
[1126.47s -> 1143.67s]  that. Okay. That looks fine. All right. Let's go back. Face. Let's talk. I got to get these
[1143.67s -> 1151.46s]  glasses off. How do I get this thing off? My, how do I get the glasses off? Okay. Yeah. We're
[1151.46s -> 1161.94s]  taking this off. Oh God. All right. We're going to the Lord of the Rings war. We're going to get
[1161.94s -> 1201.61s]  the right face. Let's go. Here it is again. This is the song. Oh my God. That one's not bad.
[1205.61s -> 1214.44s]  Neither is that one. These are not, that one's not bad either. Oh fuck. That's I think that's
[1214.44s -> 1219.46s]  the one. Oh yeah. That's the one for sure. I don't need to even see any other option.
[1230.23s -> 1239.48s]  No, no mustaches or beards or anything. That kind of looked like that. Mask. Do I wear a mask?
[1240.12s -> 1247.24s]  Why do you have a huge bulge? I didn't make that. The game made that for me.
[1253.21s -> 1266.10s]  This is me in a shitty gambit costume. No, no masks. It's going to be me. Eyewear. Glasses.
[1270.58s -> 1272.90s]  People are going to want me to wear the hat, but I don't want to wear the hat.
[1273.46s -> 1289.70s]  No, I'm going to go none. All right. No, we don't need any of that. Head shape. Normal. Slim. Chubby.
[1296.70s -> 1300.46s]  That actually is pretty good. That's kind of accurate looking. Does, don't he think?
[1301.02s -> 1314.65s]  Squashed head. No, not that one. Not even close. Not that one either. Is it big nose? It might be.
[1325.61s -> 1335.22s]  What the hell? It's this one. I, I don't think I can hear very many arguments against it.
[1336.18s -> 1347.91s]  Okay. I like it. I just realized I had all this chest hair. Hold on. Let me move my microphone
[1347.91s -> 1364.22s]  a little bit. What's wrong with my, oh. Material. Over pattern? Under pattern? Oh, okay. Hold on.
[1364.86s -> 1384.71s]  There is something like an open vest. Yeah. Oh yeah. No, no, no way. Uh, how come, how come
[1384.71s -> 1393.78s]  I'm not seeing any of this? Under pattern. Over pattern material. Oh, that's why. Okay.
[1394.34s -> 1405.27s]  Do I even have anything under? This is how Ken Shamrock used to come to the ring. I remember
[1405.27s -> 1411.11s]  he used to have like this tiny denim vest that probably like was uncomfortable to be in.
[1414.41s -> 1431.13s]  He was awesome by the way. The tuxedo vest? All right. All right. All right. All right. All
[1431.13s -> 1446.26s]  right. All right. I kind of like the, Hey, what time is it everybody? Uh, yes. Email from, uh,
[1450.12s -> 1457.99s]  D Entertainment. I don't know. I don't know who made this song. Uh, you are being sued for playing
[1457.99s -> 1468.23s]  my time 65 times in a row on stream. Each offense is worth $15,000. Therefore bringing your total,
[1468.23s -> 1484.39s]  uh, lawyer fees up to, I don't know whose song this is. Who sings this song? Whose song is this?
[1485.11s -> 1522.10s]  This is Kanye? No, it's not. Is this Kanye? Kanye East? All right. I'm going with this because I
[1522.10s -> 1532.44s]  don't know. I don't even care. Wait, this is fireworks? Does that say I am verified with
[1532.44s -> 1540.15s]  like a blue check mark or something? I feel like that's the kind of shirt people would wear around.
[1540.15s -> 1543.51s]  You'd wear that to Starbucks and just hope somebody looked at it and was like, Oh,
[1544.07s -> 1553.96s]  you are? This is fine. I don't care. The costume doesn't match. I have like a bow tie.
[1558.60s -> 1568.17s]  No, no collar shape, tight or baggy. We'll do tight. Keep the choker on. I'm not keeping the
[1568.17s -> 1587.16s]  choker on every cover. Should I have tattoos? Elbow pads. All right. Yeah. Elbow pads, wristbands.
[1587.16s -> 1602.18s]  I want to keep the gloves on. Nope. Those are smoke. So I can't take those. Skeleton hands. No. Yes.
[1604.15s -> 1611.96s]  Why did they turn me into a Roblox character? I have to mute this. Otherwise, like, what the
[1611.96s -> 1629.88s]  fuck am I doing? All right. Whatever. I'm going. Legs. It's just dick dastardly Richard's pants.
[1630.44s -> 1646.54s]  I'm German rumble. All right. Is it paint splatters? It's paint splatters. All right.
[1646.54s -> 1654.98s]  We're going to do paint splatters. Just be in a diaper. I'm going to wear just swishy pants.
[1654.98s -> 1674.38s]  That's what I wear every day. It's like loafers. Oh God. Wait, why do I have? Hold on.
[1675.34s -> 1684.01s]  Skirt with a swishy pants stripe on it and swishy pants. All right. I kind of want the shorts and
[1684.01s -> 1701.38s]  the pants. Length. Bike shorts. All right. We're going to keep it like this. I just wear bike shorts.
[1713.61s -> 1722.54s]  No, I like that. It's stupid. All right. This is my wrestling attire. This is my casual attire.
[1723.10s -> 1729.38s]  I'm going to do this really quickly. What if my casual attire was a different person's face?
[1731.66s -> 1744.79s]  Oh shit. No, you can't. I forgot what face I had. There it is.
[1749.05s -> 1756.07s]  Yeah. You can't change that. That's too bad. All right. Casual would just be like a t-shirt.
[1756.07s -> 1766.33s]  Worst game ever. I don't agree with that yet. I would just say big green shirt. That was just
[1766.33s -> 1775.42s]  a German 95 colors, right? It's just like that kind of greenish blue and like pink. Yeah. Let's
[1775.42s -> 1796.82s]  do that. Oh, material. What is this second pattern here? What's this shit on my arms? Oh,
[1796.82s -> 1817.32s]  that's arms. Okay. Okay. How do you make pink? This is just the Riddler. Well, you only think
[1817.32s -> 1822.94s]  it's the Riddler because they have those goggles on. Just wait till I take the goggles off. How do
[1822.94s -> 1830.46s]  you make pink? There we go. All right. There we go. But I don't want them to look like that.
[1833.05s -> 1836.30s]  Yeah. A little lighter than that, isn't it?
[1845.66s -> 1850.78s]  It looks fine. No gloves. I'm not going to wear gloves just hanging out like at a coffee shop.
[1853.98s -> 1870.07s]  Legs, we're going to do green and we'll do pink. Whatever. Yeah. Imagine how much of a fucking
[1870.07s -> 1878.86s]  weirdo you'd have to be to dress in your channel branding colors every day when you went out to
[1878.86s -> 1881.98s]  like the grocery store. Like, why would you do that? What would the point of that be? Why would
[1881.98s -> 1894.65s]  you be doing that? Why? It's a flex, but it wouldn't even be a flex though because nobody would know
[1894.65s -> 1902.38s]  that that's you. They would just see the colors and like this green and like pink and blue.
[1903.26s -> 1922.22s]  It's a, it's very popular color scheme. It looks like an 80s workout video. Do I have 80s workout
[1922.22s -> 1943.45s]  video color scheme? I do. Don't I? Yeah, I do. Oh, that's fine. This is not matching the top.
[1943.45s -> 1958.26s]  Whatever. Do I really care that much? Maybe a little bit. Less blue. I think it's less blue.
[1958.26s -> 1983.32s]  Yeah. No, less blue, less green, less red, less blue. 150, 3100. 150, 30, 100. Different material.
[1983.32s -> 1997.85s]  Oh shit. Okay. All right. Perfect. It's perfect. So that's casual. This is what I come to the ring
[1997.85s -> 2015.35s]  in. Oh, and I want to change the, I want, yeah, I want tucked in. Yeah, that's better. And then
[2015.35s -> 2021.66s]  referee. I don't think I need to change referee. This is, what do you mean referee? I can be a
[2021.66s -> 2028.23s]  referee. Can I be, can I do a career as a referee? Holy shit. This would be the best game ever.
[2028.79s -> 2040.20s]  Can I just be the referee? All right. I'm ready. What just happened? Oh my God. I just freaked out.
[2040.20s -> 2049.51s]  All right. We're fine. Moves. All right. This is, I'm not going to take that much time doing this,
[2049.51s -> 2054.62s]  but like I kind of want to. So like, whatever, we're going to be here for a while. All right.
[2054.62s -> 2074.62s]  These are taunts. Oh, this is entrance. I like that. Haunt. Go away. Go to sleep. That's good.
[2074.62s -> 2083.32s]  I like that. Let's see if there's a German walk. I will put, that's footwork. Not that one. Not
[2083.32s -> 2092.66s]  that one. Not that one. That one's not bad. Here or there. Hold camera. I mean, I can come up with
[2092.66s -> 2107.37s]  a camera. Invite applause. Make decision. Make a point. Middle finger. Microphone speech. Oh,
[2107.37s -> 2116.78s]  that's good too. That's good too. I like that would be the combo. This is, I love this already. All
[2116.78s -> 2136.12s]  right. Hold on. We're going to do the footwork one. Not go to sleep. Yes. The Hulk Hogan. Classic
[2136.12s -> 2148.41s]  move. Special. Oh, this is what happens when you have a special. Do the rumble in this game. I'm,
[2149.21s -> 2155.70s]  look, I blocked out two days for this game. So it's today and tomorrow because I really
[2155.70s -> 2161.91s]  feel like I'm going to be obsessed with this game for the next at least two days. Present.
[2161.91s -> 2179.05s]  Punch the air. Raise the roof. I like raised finger. Roar. Rub fingers. Oh, I don't like that.
[2179.69s -> 2191.53s]  All right. That one's fine. I'm assuming this is when you win. That's a static backflip. It's like,
[2191.53s -> 2211.21s]  holy shit. That's perfect. This would be wave. I like that. Yes. Movement. Unbelievable.
[2211.85s -> 2230.89s]  Oh, I think I want power. Point at face. Point at chest. Pat stomach. That one's good. Stance.
[2231.61s -> 2249.43s]  Fists high. Fists low. Martial arts. Grappler. Low grappler. Powerful. Eminent. Default. I think
[2249.43s -> 2258.50s]  I'd be a guy, I'd be like this. Let's see. Hands up. No, it'd be hands down. It might even be hands
[2258.58s -> 2268.86s]  lower. Do you know what this reminds me of? Those of you guys that played like FIFA or MLB the show
[2268.86s -> 2275.74s]  or Madden, they had a playlist feature where you could go in and, oh, I don't want to hear this
[2275.74s -> 2280.46s]  song that often. Maybe I want to hear this one a little less often. You could, you could remove
[2280.46s -> 2286.79s]  songs completely from the playlist. And I remember going in there when I was younger and just having
[2286.79s -> 2291.75s]  the same two or three songs that I really liked on loop. That's what this is. Like I just, I only
[2291.75s -> 2301.29s]  have one song in the playlist that I like. The only one. Even in like the WWE games, I remember
[2301.29s -> 2313.29s]  playing, what's Tess's song? Honest day, I see clearly, everything is clear. But that song,
[2313.29s -> 2320.41s]  I used to play that on repeat when I was editing people. That's Edge. Well, whatever. Sorry.
[2323.00s -> 2327.96s]  I used to put that song on repeat while I was making Earthworm Jim back in like 2014. That's
[2328.60s -> 2342.01s]  a real story. We're good. What a fake fan. Whatever. All right. That's gestures. I have to play
[2342.01s -> 2348.52s]  something else because I'm, I can't, I cannot listen to that for like another 30 minutes while
[2348.52s -> 2357.14s]  I make moves. And that's nothing to the song, right? That's nothing about what I feel about
[2357.14s -> 2360.98s]  the actual song. It's just hearing it that many times in a row. I need to have something else,
[2360.98s -> 2368.65s]  right? So I'm going to put on like a little OST or something. I'm sorry. I have to. How about,
[2369.85s -> 2377.67s]  what's something that I can just chill and make this character? Undertale OST. Oh, but that's so
[2377.67s -> 2390.06s]  good and so easy. Uphead music. Holy shit. What a brilliant idea. That's actually kind of a
[2390.06s -> 2411.77s]  brilliant idea. Oh, it's good to turn it down. Okay. I can't hear this. Why?
[2411.77s -> 2419.54s]  Okay. I don't know. Penis music. Why can I, why can I not hear this? But you can. That's kind of
[2419.54s -> 2430.98s]  strange. Why can I hear this? Now I can't. Oh, because I'm stupid. I turned it down with my
[2430.98s -> 2440.47s]  mixer. All right. Let's go. I, I can handle this. This is like character creator music.
[2441.19s -> 2453.16s]  So we need, what have we got? Attacks. This is just like no mercy, man. I can already tell you. I
[2453.16s -> 2460.87s]  already know. Can I beat puncher? I don't even, I don't want to look at any of the moves.
[2460.87s -> 2476.30s]  Slap. Is there one that goes across the face? Not down. Is this DMCA? What? Is it DMCA?
[2479.93s -> 2498.23s]  Fuck. Why? No. You know, it's crazy. Like a lot of video game musical artists that like just
[2498.23s -> 2502.71s]  kind of don't care. Isn't it weird that like a lot of their music is like just better
[2503.27s -> 2516.66s]  than the shit that gets DMCA'd? Am I like, is that, is that a shit take? Tell me. But uh,
[2523.69s -> 2533.53s]  I'm not putting that back on. Skullgirls OST. Terraria is good. That's an easy one to go back
[2533.53s -> 2547.53s]  to. Yeah. Terraria OST. Great one. There we go. Okay. I think it's going to be the slap.
[2548.09s -> 2558.18s]  This one, it's way bigger. All right. That's slap. Lower attack. Left extension kick. I like left
[2558.18s -> 2569.86s]  hook. That was not bad. I think it should just be punches. I would never kick. No, I, I physically
[2569.86s -> 2577.80s]  cannot lift my leg higher than probably the middle of my waist. I tell you, you and I ever
[2577.80s -> 2583.02s]  get in a fight, just go for the legs. Cause I, I will, I'm, I'm a puncher. You know what I mean?
[2583.02s -> 2585.66s]  Like if I would, if I'm in a situation where I was going to have to fight somebody,
[2586.46s -> 2591.35s]  it would be a flurry of right and left hands. So fast that you wouldn't even just see them.
[2592.15s -> 2603.90s]  It would be like, and you were on the ground at like three of those ago, by the way. My legs are
[2603.90s -> 2620.73s]  useless. We'll do right hook. Big attack. Bicycle kick? No. This is me falling on my back.
[2625.03s -> 2630.07s]  For a second, I thought that was part of the move. I was like, Holy shit. Diving clothesline.
[2632.65s -> 2644.65s]  Yeah. It would probably just be a huge punch. Holy shit. Although seriously don't underestimate
[2644.65s -> 2659.83s]  just running and jumping with all of your body weight at somebody. Right? How does that not hurt
[2659.83s -> 2669.91s]  you more than it hurts the person you're doing that to? Headbutts pretty nuts. Wait, it is a move.
[2673.14s -> 2682.36s]  Running attack. It would be that one. A huge running, diving punch in the face.
[2685.56s -> 2691.83s]  Well, I think this is off the top rope. I would, I would do a flip of some kind, right?
[2692.47s -> 2701.56s]  But I definitely would be holding my neck because I would be kind of scared that I was going to like
[2701.56s -> 2717.58s]  break my neck and hurt myself. Okay. That one. Flying kick. Flying clothesline. What is it?
[2717.58s -> 2733.14s]  What's this one? Middle rope. Springboard attack. Moonsault. Oh, I think this is top rope. Super
[2733.14s -> 2745.42s]  punch. Suicide dive. Wait, you just, I kind of want that one. Thrushes. Oh, so when they're on
[2745.42s -> 2750.55s]  the ground. Punches. The rest of these can probably be pretty quick until we get to the grapples.
[2751.19s -> 2759.86s]  What's this one? Big leg drop. Moonsault. Senton bomb. That one. Running move when they're on the
[2759.86s -> 2768.28s]  ground. How about, uh, how am I doing? I'm doing all right. I'm doing all right. I kind of hurt
[2768.28s -> 2777.75s]  myself a few days ago or a day or two ago, but you know, I'll be all right. I don't want to be
[2777.75s -> 2781.27s]  too ridiculous. Like this is way too ridiculous. I'm going to get so annoyed at doing these moves.
[2782.79s -> 2794.68s]  Yeah. Just like a splash is fine. That's fine too. Springboard. That one. There is one thing
[2794.84s -> 2800.60s]  I have to make sure and I hope they have it. And I think they do is my finishing move has to be
[2800.60s -> 2817.13s]  the stone cold starter. That's incredibly important. This is top rope. Elbow drop. Yep.
[2817.13s -> 2824.81s]  All right. We're almost done. Front moves. Oh God. Wait, who am I doing? I'm doing this myself?
[2827.90s -> 2837.66s]  Suplex. Monkey flip. Monkey flip. Clothesline. Chokeslam. There's no way I would be able to do
[2837.66s -> 2847.43s]  that to somebody. This does feel like a workout video of some kind, right? I'm surprised this
[2847.43s -> 2854.55s]  hasn't happened yet. Oh, like UFC workout. You need two people. Get one of your buddies over.
[2854.55s -> 2860.89s]  You're both going to be able to burn 500 calories an hour working your core, your abs, your obliques,
[2862.15s -> 2870.18s]  and your calves at the same time. You just kick the shit out of each other. Like you have to
[2870.18s -> 2885.34s]  scoop slam your friend and then he scoops slams you. Only 500 an hour. Hmm. Oh, I like that.
[2885.34s -> 2902.07s]  Into the submission. Air crash. That would have hurt so bad. I like clothesline drop. Yep.
[2902.63s -> 2906.70s]  We've got monkey flip. I'm not going to have monkey flip be every move. So we're going to do
[2906.70s -> 2911.66s]  this one over the shoulder. Well, there's no. OK, that was crazy. Piledriver. This move is banned,
[2911.66s -> 2925.74s]  but we're going to use it. I like that. All monkey flip. All right. We'll make a character
[2925.74s -> 2929.82s]  eventually that has only monkey flip for a move and it's going to be infuriating. There it is.
[2930.46s -> 2933.10s]  All right. Well, that's my special move, though, not a regular move.
[2935.27s -> 2945.13s]  I love this stunner. It's like the best move ever. Test of strength. Need that one. Actually,
[2945.13s -> 2954.89s]  if it's just a regular move, though, that kind of sucks. Work and run is pretty sick. Cross
[2954.89s -> 2966.87s]  body is pretty sick. I like that one. Running. Spear. Run and slide is headlock take down.
[2966.87s -> 2980.92s]  Just make it a headbutt. Running and down is DDT. That's cooler. Pick up move. Oop,
[2981.00s -> 2990.78s]  insecure. Sunset flip. What if every move was the stunner, though? Would that be better?
[2994.38s -> 3001.42s]  Play the right version. What are you talking about? This is the way you want to play the old
[3001.42s -> 3005.98s]  version of the game. This is the one that just came out like six days ago. Why are you beating
[3005.98s -> 3022.52s]  up Hank Hill? Front power slam. I like it. Small package. Oh, I don't know, but they don't really
[3022.52s -> 3037.98s]  know. They don't really know me very well. Shoulder drop. Shoulder boulder screwdriver.
[3037.98s -> 3044.81s]  Holy shit, that would kill somebody. OK, momentum. Monkey flip. All right, fine.
[3044.81s -> 3054.01s]  Running. I like that. High cross body. Diamond cutter. That was awesome. Hey,
[3054.01s -> 3064.60s]  speaking of diamond cutter, didn't Diamond Dallas Page make a Pilates or a yoga program?
[3064.60s -> 3071.42s]  And it's actually like one of the best yoga platforms you can possibly do. Isn't DDP yoga
[3071.42s -> 3078.63s]  considered to be like one of the top tier, like A or S tier yoga programs? Maybe I should get it.
[3078.63s -> 3098.09s]  Half crusher. Whoa. All right. That one's weird. I like it. All right, here we go. Stunner. This
[3098.09s -> 3105.86s]  is my special. This is my finishing move. But the tombstone is awesome, too. But there's no way I
[3105.86s -> 3114.31s]  would be able to do the tombstone. Stunner. Yep. Nice. OK, rear moves. These are less important
[3114.31s -> 3119.93s]  after me, I think. These can be fine. These are all fine. Just like a face plant DDT. Yeah,
[3119.93s -> 3131.02s]  that one's cool. How about rear special? Here we go. Dragon suplex. The electric chair. Oh,
[3131.74s -> 3139.21s]  burning hammer. Holy shit. Abdominal stretch. Yeah, I did one of these like three days ago and
[3139.21s -> 3154.01s]  like tore a muscle in my shoulder. It sucked. I'm going to use it in the corner. Head smashes. Oh,
[3154.01s -> 3169.00s]  yeah, I like those. Yeah, I'm doing mounted punches. All right. So this is these are fine,
[3169.00s -> 3176.06s]  although I do want to do the the sharpshooter legs and attack. Do they have a sharpshooter?
[3176.06s -> 3182.41s]  There it is. If you were in this, you would get right. The hitman heart put you in one of these.
[3183.29s -> 3187.34s]  You weren't getting up. You were done right in the middle of the ring. You got nowhere to go.
[3187.34s -> 3203.46s]  It's over. Legs and run. Half crab. I want a Boston crab. All right, that's good.
[3204.10s -> 3211.03s]  And I think that's it. I just don't want to be heckle horn. Relationships promotion. I'm in
[3211.03s -> 3218.44s]  wrestling school. Roll wrestler. Oh, I could be a referee, but should I just be a referee?
[3219.32s -> 3223.24s]  No, I can't. We'll do that another day with another character. I want to be like a wrestler.
[3223.96s -> 3230.95s]  I want to be a heel loaning manager. I don't have any friends or anything. I'm just going to be like
[3230.95s -> 3237.67s]  a lone guy. OK. All right. All right. All right. This is fine. We'll make our own friends and
[3237.67s -> 3245.13s]  enemies as we play. I do need to change this name from heckle horn. I think I have to type it.
[3251.56s -> 3263.24s]  I can end up press A. OK. All right. There we go. I can turn the terraria soundtrack off.
[3263.80s -> 3278.01s]  It was good. You can now go back to the actual game sounds. You might get to hear my time one
[3278.01s -> 3284.82s]  more time. All right. I'm ready. I'm excited. Yeah. I spent like an hour fucking around,
[3284.82s -> 3291.02s]  but whatever. I'm in for the long haul right now. At least today into tomorrow.
[3291.02s -> 3298.62s]  I thought this was terraria still. All right. We're good. We're good. We're good.
[3299.51s -> 3310.02s]  This is done. There's Jerma. Jerma985. I think I picked career. Are you ready? Are you ready to
[3310.02s -> 3333.03s]  play? I think I know how to play. Let's go. Play career with Jerma. That's me. I'm ready to start.
[3333.03s -> 3342.34s]  OK. Wrestling school. July 2021. Singles versus tall order. Zero dollars. X zero weeks. Creative
[3342.34s -> 3350.12s]  control. I have five thousand dollars. What about gimmick? Oh, OK. I think I just go. All right.
[3353.29s -> 3376.50s]  We got all order. How come there's nobody here? Wait, why is there a chair already?
[3379.56s -> 3387.62s]  Wait, why is there a chair? Why is there a table? This is me. Oh, I got to wait.
[3388.50s -> 3406.79s]  No, get in the ring. Fucking ring. Why is there a chair? This is where your story starts, Jerma.
[3406.79s -> 3411.45s]  What? You'll have to learn the ropes here each week. For some people, it never happens while
[3411.45s -> 3418.22s]  others wish it because they've up back here broken. Why is he holding a chair? Be careful
[3418.22s -> 3425.00s]  what you sign up for because there'll be a lot of promoters trying to take advantage of you. OK.
[3425.00s -> 3428.89s]  But if you look after yourself and make smart choices, it's perfectly possible to have a
[3428.89s -> 3435.74s]  fulfilling career. OK. Anyway, let's see what you got before we see how far you'll go.
[3443.83s -> 3458.25s]  Why does he put the chair down? Get off the top floor. Is he here? Wait, don't fight the coach.
[3458.89s -> 3470.70s]  All right. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. Yeah, motherfucker. Pretty good. Can I use this?
[3470.70s -> 3477.45s]  I'm going to use a weapon. I'm kicking the shit out of this guy. All right. Give me the. Here we go.
[3478.49s -> 3485.78s]  Drop it. Drop it. Take it. Take it. Take it. Whatever. Get out of the way.
[3491.80s -> 3504.20s]  Ha ha ha. Pick him up. Pick him up. Give him the Boston Crab. Come on. Break his neck. Who's
[3504.20s -> 3513.38s]  Blonde Blunder? Who the fuck is this? Get out of here. What do you do? What do I get from the
[3513.38s -> 3526.54s]  audience? It's two on one right now. This is not fair. How come the referee is not kicking this
[3526.54s -> 3545.51s]  guy out of the ring? Yeah. Get him out. Get this guy out of here. Get this guy out of here. What the
[3545.59s -> 3566.26s]  fuck? Oh, this is awesome. I got to pick him up. Here we go. What is it? What's coming out of his
[3566.26s -> 3574.26s]  head? Pick him up. All right. We're going to do it. We're going to do Spine Buster. No, we're not.
[3574.26s -> 3585.53s]  I'm going to throw him. How do you throw him off the ropes? Ow. Hey, wait. He just kicked me in
[3585.53s -> 3601.05s]  the balls. That's illegal. I'm not going to tap out. I'm fine. Get up. Here we go. Off the ropes.
[3601.05s -> 3617.59s]  Why did he not? What the fuck? Hey, what's that? Wait, he's mad at the ref. I'm not fucking around
[3617.59s -> 3633.77s]  anymore. How do you block? This guy's like two weight classes ahead of me. This is not even fair.
[3634.41s -> 3649.78s]  This guy's like 400 pounds. I'm 150. Am I bleeding? There's not even an audience to do that for.
[3650.34s -> 3673.14s]  Get on the top rope. I'm still winning. Oh, that was pretty sick. Pick him up. All right. I got
[3673.14s -> 3681.35s]  him right. I must have a special, right? Get off. Why is he on the top rope? All right. Should I try
[3681.35s -> 3706.17s]  to pin him? He just literally just kicked me in the balls. Get up. That's so stupid. Yeah. Thanks
[3706.17s -> 3714.86s]  a lot, referee. It took you like a full three minutes to kick the guy out that was in the ring
[3714.86s -> 3724.33s]  that shouldn't have been in the ring and he's still here. He just tripped and his face exploded in
[3724.33s -> 3742.81s]  blood. How about the spin punch? Oh my God. It worked. Five minutes remaining. We're taking too
[3742.81s -> 3757.14s]  much time. Why can he just do that to me? Reverse it. God, I just want to throw in a weapon so bad.
[3757.86s -> 3766.84s]  Um, hold on a second. No, not on the first match. I saw something down there. It's because you
[3766.84s -> 3779.94s]  dumped all your stats into attitude. Well, I'm, I better get some points for this. Oh, it's over.
[3779.94s -> 3810.39s]  Pin him. How do you pin? Oh, fuck you. Stay down. Pin him. I need a special. What the fuck just
[3810.39s -> 3835.08s]  happened? Oh my God. I think I killed him. Get over here. What the fuck was that? Ow. Ow, my chest.
[3837.96s -> 3842.25s]  I know this game is going to be bad for me. I already know it. I didn't even need to start. I
[3842.25s -> 3852.63s]  just started too. Oh, is he going to get up? Go on the top turn buckle.
[3855.86s -> 3883.37s]  Just taunting the ring. What happened to this guy? Oh shit. He grabbed me at nine. Are you
[3883.37s -> 3899.10s]  fucking kidding me? No way. Get off me. There's only five minutes remaining. He's getting sick
[3899.10s -> 3916.84s]  of this. Wait, you're going to get disqualified. Isn't he going to get disqualified? We're both so
[3916.84s -> 3924.66s]  fucked up right now. Why can't either of us win? We're both so fucked up. Just pin him.
[3927.21s -> 3938.73s]  I can't win. Look at how screwed up we are. At what point does the ref stop the match? Because
[3938.73s -> 3957.37s]  this is just embarrassing and horrible for both of us. What? This is the practice match? All right.
[3957.37s -> 3968.97s]  I got to go for a big move here. Right here. Right in the head. Good night. I was at a one count.
[3975.54s -> 3985.42s]  Stay down. Stay down. This one minute. We're about to hit the enrage timer. Does the referee start
[3985.42s -> 4001.77s]  fucking punching us? Get over here. All right. That's it. There it is. Wait, I've just received
[4001.77s -> 4011.32s]  word back from backstage that this match must be restarted immediately. What? What are you talking
[4011.32s -> 4022.18s]  about? He just gave me the finger. That guy just flipped me off. That's not fair. What are you
[4022.18s -> 4059.48s]  talking about? What? He's just like killing me. I'm like puking. What the fuck? That's not fair,
[4059.48s -> 4073.06s]  dude. No. Give me that bat. Give me that bat. I'm here to challenge you to a match on the fourth
[4073.06s -> 4079.54s]  week of July. Oh, you really? All right. If this is the only way to get your attention,
[4079.54s -> 4090.66s]  you'll agree to face me in front of the whole... All right. It's a date? All right. Fuck this guy.
[4090.66s -> 4096.10s]  All right. It's a date. Get off of me. I guess you're not the coward I thought you were. At least
[4096.10s -> 4104.60s]  you'll put up a fight before you lose. Wait, I'm fighting this guy right now? What are you talking
[4104.60s -> 4115.26s]  about? Isn't this the fourth of July? What day is it? What fucking day is it right now? I think
[4115.98s -> 4127.30s]  that's blonde blunder. That's the guy. It says I'm fighting him. That's illegal. That's illegal.
[4127.30s -> 4134.28s]  Throw him out of here. That was illegal. He just threw a bat in my head. That's illegal. That's
[4134.28s -> 4139.64s]  illegal. He just threw a bat at me. Okay. You know when you play Bloodborne and you go and you
[4139.72s -> 4149.96s]  kill like fucking 30 people, your clothes are just covered in blood. This is so unfair.
[4159.10s -> 4166.95s]  Just pin me already. Am I even supposed to win this? Stop. He's dead already. I know.
[4168.07s -> 4180.73s]  How do I get out of... I have no control of the character. Okay. I have to pin this guy.
[4180.73s -> 4186.62s]  Is there anything I can do to kill the... Okay. You know what? Fuck it. That guy didn't get
[4186.62s -> 4210.68s]  disqualified. So neither am I. Yeah. Drop it. Okay. Are you... This is so stupid. I love it.
[4211.08s -> 4220.71s]  This game is amazing. This is like the first match. Fuck you. Yeah. Disqualified, apparently.
[4222.82s -> 4226.58s]  It's me who decides who wins and loses, Jerma, and I've decided that you're a loser.
[4227.38s -> 4249.46s]  Why can I still fight? I need a second. I need to take a... Hold on. I need like a five second break.
[4263.82s -> 4270.50s]  Okay. So the wrestling review. In all the latest action from Wrestling School's training session,
[4270.50s -> 4277.62s]  Jerma was disqualified at 12 minutes and 17 seconds. Jerma's strength has risen to 70%
[4277.62s -> 4288.02s]  after participating in that match. In all the latest action, Tall Order's profile has risen
[4288.02s -> 4294.09s]  after taking part in such a compelling match. Blonde Blunder has generated a buzz by interfering
[4294.09s -> 4304.97s]  in that one and I made... I lost $200 because I used an explosive or something. Is that what it
[4304.97s -> 4313.08s]  was? Expenses? What is this? I see you had fun out there, Jerma, but you made quite a mess of
[4313.08s -> 4322.86s]  the arena. Okay. If we ever want to book this venue again, you better pay $100 towards the damages.
[4323.50s -> 4336.30s]  How about you referee? That's absolute bullshit. Why are there sticks of dynamite in your arena
[4336.30s -> 4347.90s]  lit that have like a hairpin trigger if they're touched? What are you talking about? That's not
[4347.90s -> 4353.08s]  my problem. It really isn't. I suppose you're right. What did they expect when they let a
[4353.08s -> 4364.63s]  wrestling show into the venue? All right. I got it. Third week of July. Your bat prop costs money.
[4365.88s -> 4373.05s]  I hope it doesn't. New middleweight champion. Booker Hudson has defeated Greg McMahon to become
[4373.05s -> 4379.78s]  the new middleweight champion of Weekend Warriors. Crucial Kennedy feels great today and is in perfect
[4379.78s -> 4386.71s]  health. Blonde Blunder has developed a heated rivalry with Jigsaw Jeremy of all American
[4386.71s -> 4394.57s]  wrestling. Yeah, that guy sucked. Jerma's proposed match against Blonde Blunder on the fourth week
[4394.57s -> 4407.05s]  of July has been canceled. Oh, so what was that all about? That guy just fucked up the whole match,
[4407.05s -> 4415.18s]  came down, challenged me to a duel, and then canceled on me. I've had, and somehow I lost
[4415.18s -> 4422.98s]  popularity. A lot of it. Okay. Well, proceed. All right. I got to win this one. Singles. Let's go.
[4422.98s -> 4432.46s]  Who is it? Oh, wait, I thought he canceled on me. Wait, he canceled and moved it up to the third
[4432.46s -> 4443.86s]  week of July instead of the fourth week of July. What are the rules of this match? Can he just hold
[4443.86s -> 4465.35s]  that? Put it down. I'm not putting mine down until he puts his down. I'm not getting in there until
[4465.35s -> 4482.25s]  he puts it down. The referee got a camera. Why does he have a camera? Wait, are we allowed to have
[4482.25s -> 4494.41s]  these? Anybody who couldn't beat tall order doesn't belong in the ring with me. Tall order is nothing
[4494.41s -> 4509.42s]  compared to me, and that makes you less than nothing. Holy shit. My mouth. That's so unfair.
[4509.42s -> 4519.62s]  That's unfair. That's unfair. I ran at him and he, I was like a bull. Get away from me. Why is my
[4519.62s -> 4530.66s]  health so low already? He's just doing my moves. All right. I got to play this smart. God damn it.
[4531.30s -> 4544.71s]  Get that shit out of the ring, please. Here we go. All right. Slow and steady. I don't know what
[4544.71s -> 4558.55s]  just happened, but I got hurt. I let go of him. Why did I let go of him? That was good. Pick him up.
[4559.11s -> 4577.30s]  All right. Good. Momentum. Keep going. Good. Come on. I grappled him. Why did he reverse it?
[4577.30s -> 4588.10s]  Let go of me. Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go. Why can't I reverse moves?
[4588.66s -> 4612.38s]  That's my, that's my move of choice and the spin one. Oh my God. Why? What the fuck?
[4616.76s -> 4627.64s]  I need somebody to come interfere for me on my behalf, right? Is he biting me? I hear bites.
[4632.30s -> 4641.46s]  I get off of me. Let go of my neck. All right. I'm going to win. I'm going to,
[4641.46s -> 4652.28s]  I'm going to do a coward's play here. Is it 10 count? That was pretty good. Double disqualification.
[4652.28s -> 4683.90s]  It's the only way I can win. Don't let him get out. Don't let him leave. I win. Oh, oh my God.
[4686.36s -> 4706.41s]  Okay. I feel like I don't tap. Don't tap. Don't tap. Don't tap. Don't tap. All right.
[4706.41s -> 4720.60s]  I'm not doing that bad considering I started with less health. I got to do some reversals.
[4720.60s -> 4733.35s]  I think it's just random though. All right. Come here. How did I hurt? How did I hurt my balls?
[4733.35s -> 4740.33s]  Jumping. Bat? If I use the bat, I'm going to get disqualified.
[4740.33s -> 4749.82s]  God. How does he keep hitting me in the balls? Get up. What the fuck? It's not fair. I started
[4749.82s -> 4764.14s]  with half health. Dermot's profile has suffered considerably, considerably after being defeated
[4764.14s -> 4771.96s]  so easily. Juan Blunder's progress is being hindered by the limitations of wrestling school.
[4776.44s -> 4788.07s]  I'm taking the bat away. I'm literally losing money. Mary Class has defeated Ivy Windsor to
[4788.07s -> 4799.14s]  become the new women's champion of Maple Leaf Grappling. Gimmick. Whoa. Why is that? Why am
[4799.14s -> 4815.29s]  I losing strength? What was that? That was weird. What was that? Get this prop out of here. Yeah.
[4815.29s -> 4825.24s]  No, none. I'm just wasting money. Does this mean training strength? You were losing health to gain
[4825.24s -> 4836.28s]  strength. All right. I'm going to go for one more attempt. Proceed. I took the bat off.
[4840.84s -> 4844.60s]  Whack Axe will visit school on the third week of August to inspire the students.
[4845.16s -> 4851.50s]  What the fuck? Danny Might could not be woken from his sleep this morning. The 51-year-old
[4851.50s -> 4859.48s]  veteran is thought to have died of natural causes. What? What the fuck? The industry will come
[4859.48s -> 4867.80s]  together this week to stage a special tribute memory of Danny Might. Nice to meet you,
[4867.80s -> 4874.30s]  Jerma. We invited you here to discuss working for Rising Sun Fururesu. Is this a new promotion?
[4875.10s -> 4879.02s]  You're not exactly a priority for us right now, but we'd consider bringing you in with this deal.
[4884.81s -> 4894.57s]  Advance. $200 per week for 32 weeks. No creative control. May not make or refuse any changes. Um,
[4894.57s -> 4904.55s]  that seems like that doesn't- that sucks. Wait. I want a- I want $500 a week. I want creative
[4904.55s -> 4911.54s]  control. And I want- and I want $2,000 upfront. And I want $800 a week. And I want it for 30- 28
[4911.54s -> 4920.34s]  weeks. Who do you think you are to make those demands? You're obviously not taking this very
[4920.34s -> 4928.89s]  seriously. I just put it back. Nothing has changed since the last time you proposed that.
[4928.89s -> 4933.48s]  You're obviously not willing to compromise. I didn't mean to do that. All right. Well,
[4933.48s -> 4935.88s]  obviously not getting anywhere. Let's just forget about it for the time being.
[4938.36s -> 4944.81s]  Smoke! Hey, Jerma. I understand you've got a match against Slasher Sweetie tonight.
[4944.89s -> 4950.57s]  Shmo- Shmoke Mentor arc? How would you like me to take him out for you? If you give me $130,
[4950.57s -> 4963.80s]  I'll make sure he hobbles to the ring. That's- what? No problem. Consider the match won already.
[4963.80s -> 4974.65s]  Once I'm finished with him, there won't be much left. What is this music? Why is this slow?
[4975.54s -> 4985.10s]  This is- wait, guys. This is my time, but it's slowed down. Why is this happening?
[4992.38s -> 4998.73s]  Okay, here we go. Proceed. Singles match. Oh, we got a crowd this time.
[4999.29s -> 5013.24s]  Jerma! And with Coach Emerson. Why is he coming out here? Why does the referee have a mask on
[5013.24s -> 5026.94s]  and a bat? Waving to the fans. Slasher Sweetie with Lance Monaco. He's all fucked up, but he
[5026.94s -> 5037.38s]  has a microphone too. I just tried to throw the microphone at him. I just threw the microphone
[5037.38s -> 5051.40s]  at him. Fuck, I fell. Who's giving- did he give him the finger to who? This show is dedicated
[5051.40s -> 5056.18s]  to the memory of Danny Might, who recently passed away. What the fuck? Get away from me.
[5056.18s -> 5060.84s]  Danny Might's work in this ring meant a lot to fans, but the person he was backstage meant
[5060.84s -> 5067.66s]  even more to us. Who am I talking to? He lived for his family, and through them he lives on.
[5067.66s -> 5074.30s]  We hope the donations from this show bring them comfort. Oh wait, this is- oh, that's enough
[5074.30s -> 5078.14s]  talking. Danny Might is sitting up there waiting for his show, so let's give him one. Did I like
[5079.56s -> 5092.65s]  sabotage this guy on a charity event? Are you fucking kidding me? This guy's not
[5092.65s -> 5120.09s]  getting up. Get the fuck out of here. Oh yeah, eat this! Wait, what? What the fuck? I can hurt
[5120.09s -> 5150.17s]  the people and I can hurt these people? Wait, why? What? Where is he? Oh shit, he got up.
[5151.35s -> 5159.66s]  Actually, I don't know if you could like attack the commentators. He's gaining health. All right,
[5159.66s -> 5162.14s]  no no, no more fucking around. I'm gonna beat this. I'm gonna beat it. I'm gonna- here we go.
[5179.70s -> 5197.50s]  I can't. I can't play this. This is so stupid. I can't. Ow. Why do that? Okay, I gotta settle down.
[5197.50s -> 5210.36s]  Okay, I just- oh, come here. Just get out. Sit down already. This weird shit just keeps happening. I
[5210.36s -> 5220.84s]  can't fucking focus. Why would the referee do that? All right, get up. All right, here we go.
[5221.40s -> 5231.83s]  This is it. Tap out. That was a wheeze. All the air just left my body when the referee
[5231.83s -> 5243.27s]  used his clothesline. It doesn't make any sense. Why would a referee do that? That's it. What the
[5243.27s -> 5268.25s]  fuck? This guy's pissed. That's a pin. Referee, get the fuck over here. Oh my god. Pin! Oh my god.
[5274.68s -> 5279.72s]  This is it. Oh, he's not gonna get up from that one. It's over. I literally just broke his head.
[5279.72s -> 5309.80s]  I smashed his skull. It's over. Got it. He's biting the ref. He's so mad. Slasher Sweeney
[5309.80s -> 5314.28s]  has damaged the reputation of all American wrestling by failing to win that inter-promotional
[5314.28s -> 5325.35s]  contest. Irma's profile has improved considerably by winning at a major event. Lance Monaco is
[5325.35s -> 5333.62s]  disappointed that his client lost that match. All right. Holy shit, do I get some of that?
[5333.62s -> 5347.74s]  $450,000. I only get a hundred bucks. I don't get any money. I didn't get anything. Oh, that was
[5347.74s -> 5352.46s]  right. Right. Never mind. All right. I'm sorry. I forgot that was a charity event. I'm sorry.
[5355.00s -> 5366.02s]  I forgot. Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. Midwinter and Monica Marquez have defeated Major
[5366.02s -> 5370.98s]  Merc and Sergeant Acer to become the new Tag Team Champions of Wrestling Revolution.
[5370.98s -> 5377.51s]  Lestat McCabray has defeated Helix to become the new Intercontinental Champion of the Federation.
[5377.51s -> 5386.15s]  Obby Ball has been appointed as the new Booker of Weekend Warriors. Game of Thrones. Federation
[5386.15s -> 5389.83s]  Online have overtaken All American Wrestling to become the most popular brand of wrestling with
[5389.83s -> 5403.61s]  a ratings of 89%. All right. 4200 bucks. Why am I bringing pops to the ring? Gimmick. All right,
[5403.61s -> 5416.46s]  let's go. Proceed. Singles match. Outback. I need to actually win. Let me actually wrestle and win
[5416.46s -> 5422.14s]  a match. I don't have to have it just be total insanity. That guy already has a grenade in his
[5422.14s -> 5427.90s]  hand. So I don't know what's going to happen with that. I don't know why he's holding it currently,
[5427.90s -> 5431.02s]  but he's looking at the referee. The referee's leaving the ring.
[5431.98s -> 5452.04s]  Do you still have it? I ain't going in there. He's holding two. He's going to videotape himself.
[5452.04s -> 5469.13s]  What? What is going on? What's wrong with this guy? Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this singles
[5469.13s -> 5482.26s]  match. Weighing in at 170 pounds and standing at five foot eight, first welcome Jerma. Weighing 254,
[5482.26s -> 5490.17s]  511 is Outback. Holding a cartoon stick of dynamite and a camera. Let's ring the bell and find
[5490.17s -> 5506.33s]  ourselves a winner. Uh-huh. Can I get that out of the ring? I'm trying to get it. I don't want
[5506.33s -> 5521.24s]  to have it be in the ring. All right, here we go. Evenly matched, except he's got 60 pounds on me.
[5521.24s -> 5546.30s]  Oh, Jesus. Fuck. Is it a dud? I don't think it is. All right, I gotta fucking wrestle and do this the
[5546.30s -> 5563.94s]  way that I do. There we are. That was a big move. Nice. Why is he? He just baited me. That was
[5563.94s -> 5581.16s]  fucking ridiculous. He just caught my arm. All right, step on his head. Wrench it. This is doing
[5581.16s -> 5599.06s]  damage. Oh my God. That was a bad place to be. All right, more. I'm going to throw him against
[5599.06s -> 5621.91s]  ropes, but that was nice. Good job. Monkey flip. Perfect. Good execution. Oh, he blocked it. Shit.
[5621.91s -> 5645.62s]  Sorry. Rope break. Oh, fuck you. Still evenly matched. It's fine. Test of strength. I don't
[5645.62s -> 5659.30s]  know. I don't have no idea how to win. He just raffled. He did a goofy scream.
[5665.72s -> 5682.25s]  Holy shit. What did I just do to him? How do I do that again? Get out of here. Get that shit out of
[5682.25s -> 5691.72s]  here. Oops. Sorry, he didn't see it. Move out of the way, ref. I'm trying to fucking work here.
[5691.72s -> 5712.42s]  Goodbye. All right, I got the hang of this now. Oops. I almost have my finisher. I gotta build up
[5712.42s -> 5723.98s]  my finisher and actually do it. That hurts. Watch out. Run away. Just get away. Get away. Get away.
[5723.98s -> 5736.15s]  Get away. Get away. Get away. Get away. Get away. Get away. Get away. Get away. Watch it. Where are
[5736.15s -> 5744.18s]  you going? Are you fucking kidding me? That was a good move. I grabbed his ass and I spun him
[5744.18s -> 5774.04s]  around. How is this guy doing this? It doesn't make any sense. Get in here. All right. I just
[5774.04s -> 5787.05s]  grabbed him. Why is he instantly reversed this shit? There it is. Nice. All right. Good. Good.
[5787.05s -> 5799.64s]  Keep it going. It's because he's stronger than you. Get out of the way, ref. Why would you stand in
[5799.64s -> 5825.42s]  the way? Good. All right. I still have the upper hand. I'm fine. Good. Grab him by the head. I gotta
[5825.42s -> 5834.52s]  grab him. I gotta get him in the middle of the ring. Where's he going? Come here. Where'd he go?
[5834.52s -> 5844.68s]  What the fuck are you doing? I have no idea what just happened, but I just fucked him up bad.
[5844.68s -> 5861.24s]  Watch out for the bomb. I'm not touching that. Damn it. Oh, that was worth a lot of points.
[5861.24s -> 5873.72s]  Let me try that again. Oh, here we go. There's no rope here. I might get him to tap. There's no
[5873.72s -> 5883.62s]  rope in sight. He's got low health. This is over. That's my special. It's almost there. Oh, we're
[5883.62s -> 5898.18s]  gonna get to see the stunner. Come on. Tap out. Am I even putting pressure on him? What's going on?
[5898.74s -> 5906.44s]  I feel like this guy's just letting me do this and just taking a breather for a few minutes.
[5906.44s -> 5910.68s]  This does not hurt him at all. And he's just like, thank God this guy, this this wuss thinks he's
[5910.68s -> 5920.54s]  hurting me. I can breathe for like five minutes. Rip his arm out of his socket. Oh my God.
[5922.17s -> 5938.02s]  Why did I lose special for that? Yes. Here we go. It's over. It's time for the stunner.
[5939.40s -> 5947.56s]  Good night. Game over. That's a popularity boost right there.
[5948.12s -> 5964.30s]  Is this illegal? Why did I lose skill? Nerma's profile has improved considerably by winning
[5964.30s -> 5969.34s]  so convincingly. Outback's profile has suffered considerably after being defeated so easily.
[5971.96s -> 5977.35s]  All right. There was a lot of people in the attendance. Oh, what? I'm just bleeding money.
[5978.31s -> 5981.19s]  Where's this hundred dollars of expenses coming from? Anybody know?
[5984.44s -> 5994.12s]  It's the training. All American Wrestling product has come under criticism in recent weeks with
[5994.12s -> 6001.24s]  ratings down to 85 percent. A new women's champion, Nervana's defeated comic Connie.
[6002.95s -> 6008.62s]  Oh, Nerma, aren't you tired of pouring your energy into working out for such small gains?
[6009.34s -> 6015.10s]  For just a hundred and twenty dollars, I could hook you up with some steroids.
[6015.10s -> 6033.94s]  It will give you big results. Fast. Um, do I get, do I get caught? You'll feel the results in no time.
[6033.94s -> 6042.39s]  Holy shit, it worked. Four man elimination versus multiple opponents in this one.
[6051.72s -> 6073.24s]  Needles. I love how they just put tables out there even when it's not a hardcore match.
[6073.24s -> 6090.47s]  Driver 88. You did steroids and you're versus needles. Yeah. So are we all in the ring at the
[6090.47s -> 6129.00s]  same time? How long can my entrance be? This is so stupid. Can I go into the audience?
[6129.88s -> 6156.84s]  I'm like signing autographs. All right, I'm in. Oh, you want to give me the finger?
[6156.84s -> 6165.75s]  And the final contestant is Black Axe with Matt Dickey. Wait, the dev is here?
[6166.47s -> 6170.87s]  This guy must be a big deal. The dev is, is literally this guy's manager.
[6171.59s -> 6182.33s]  Who should I focus on? Black Axe, you only remain the world champion this long by ducking me.
[6182.97s -> 6193.08s]  Everybody knows that I'm the biggest threat to that little title. My mouth. Ow, my face.
[6193.08s -> 6211.91s]  Please. Now I'll show you why you were right to fear me. Okay. My manager is always just in here.
[6212.63s -> 6217.99s]  All right. So this is the, why do I? All right. Here's the play. The play is to get out of the,
[6217.99s -> 6221.43s]  just run away and have these guys fight each other and kill each other. And I come in.
[6222.07s -> 6226.79s]  It's like the scavenger as the vulture. Just pin the last suspecting person.
[6231.30s -> 6237.74s]  Oops. Watch that. Watch that. Watch that. All right. I'm going to focus on,
[6238.46s -> 6244.98s]  why don't we all just gang up on Whack Axe? He's the champion. It's just carnage over there.
[6244.98s -> 6251.29s]  What if I take the belt? I'm going to grab the belt and just like leave. I got it.
[6255.02s -> 6276.66s]  All right. Fine. I'll put it down. I got to focus on this guy. Oh my God. How is anybody supposed
[6276.66s -> 6290.06s]  to get pinned in this? Right in the face. I have to wait till they get to my level. But I, I'm
[6290.06s -> 6293.98s]  going to do what I used to do in no mercy. Just stand in the corner and taunt until I have a
[6293.98s -> 6299.53s]  special and use my special on like the lowest guy. This taunt builds your special. If it works
[6299.53s -> 6304.84s]  like no mercy, it does very briefly. And they're getting pissed that I'm doing that. All right.
[6304.84s -> 6324.18s]  This guy right here. Get out of here M. Dickie. I have such a low health. It's not even funny.
[6324.74s -> 6344.46s]  Distracted by the chair. Idiot. You know what? Get. All right. Come on in. Get in. Get in. Get
[6344.46s -> 6351.86s]  in. He's not paying attention. All right. Do something stupid. Hurt him. How did I let him
[6351.86s -> 6356.02s]  do that? I tried to grab him and he grabbed me by the head. It's cause I'm so weak. I even did
[6356.02s -> 6368.54s]  steroids before this match. It didn't even matter. I did steroids an hour ago. Here we go. Nice.
[6370.33s -> 6379.67s]  Black Axe. Austin crab this motherfucker right now. You two fight each other.
[6382.42s -> 6389.05s]  I, I pinned him. No, I eliminated him. What? What's happening right now? Why is he not like.
[6395.21s -> 6397.93s]  Like he's out. He's eliminated. Get him out of here.
[6398.57s -> 6417.03s]  I just know I eliminated his ass. Get him out. Come on. All right. Don't get eliminated. Run
[6417.03s -> 6427.29s]  away. Run away. Let them fight. Grab him from behind. There we go. Nice. All right. Don't pay
[6427.29s -> 6445.19s]  attention to me. You focus on each other. Good. Just I'm just a person in the audience. Don't
[6445.19s -> 6475.19s]  mind me. I'm going to get a special. I'm going to use it. Oh, does this make me more popular
[6475.19s -> 6487.70s]  if I play to the crowd? Holy shit. Sneak, sneak, sneak, sneak out, sneak out, sneak out, sneak out.
[6487.70s -> 6507.45s]  Oh shit. I'm trying to run away. Come on. Get away. Oh my head. Now I'm getting just double
[6507.45s -> 6518.89s]  teamed. This is bad. He was holding my arms back. Why is he taking his chair? He just. Why? My
[6518.89s -> 6526.23s]  coach just literally took the chair that the commentator was sitting on. Why? What's wrong
[6526.23s -> 6543.62s]  with you? The commentator is now coming into the ring. Like what are you doing out here?
[6545.45s -> 6561.90s]  This is who is this? Tony Land. All right. I'm going to stop this guy. No. Reverse it, please.
[6565.75s -> 6583.74s]  That's fine. Pin him. I could care less. That took me so long to get up. That's fine. Kick his ass.
[6584.62s -> 6594.12s]  What is he doing? Okay. That guy just got fired and he just doesn't care. Check this out. Stunner.
[6594.92s -> 6625.22s]  Come here. Come here. Stunner. Pin him. No longer the champion. He's gone. Oh, there's no ref. I'm
[6625.22s -> 6636.34s]  fine. I hope he fights the commentator. I don't know what the ref is doing. I have no idea. Thank
[6636.34s -> 6648.81s]  God. Coach. What's his name? Coach Emerson. I think this is going to be a win. Am I going to be the
[6648.81s -> 6665.69s]  champion after this? Referee is not looking. Referee is not paying attention. Oh shit. Test
[6665.69s -> 6681.43s]  of strength. Let's go. Oh, he's so much stronger than me. No. I'm so much weaker than him. What the
[6681.43s -> 6711.29s]  fuck? Get up. Get up. Let go of me. Fuck. Nope. Not going to happen. Wait till he gets up. Oh my God.
[6711.29s -> 6736.34s]  There it is. Going top rope. Oh my God. Oh no. Oh, that sucked. Don't let him knock you down. Good.
[6736.34s -> 6758.06s]  All right. We got it. I'm going for a submission again. He's done. Don't coach. Don't screw this
[6758.06s -> 6764.68s]  up for me. This is really close. I don't know what just happened there, but apparently not
[6764.68s -> 6773.38s]  something good. Get up. I'm so dazed right now. I'm just going to hang out out here until I get
[6773.38s -> 6786.66s]  my breath. Am I all right? I think I'm okay. I'm going back in. Whatever. I don't care if I
[6786.66s -> 6797.46s]  hurt the ref. Did I just hurt my own shoulder? Oh fuck you. No way. Get off me. Reverse it. Reverse
[6797.46s -> 6809.61s]  it. Reverse it. Reverse it. Reverse it. Rope break. I'm so slow to get up. I'm so weak. Oh no.
[6809.61s -> 6824.74s]  Good. Breather. Take a breather. Take a breather. Take a breather. All right. I'm fine. That was
[6824.74s -> 6841.18s]  huge. I just got to get up. Take a breather still. I grabbed him and he did a move to me. Oh, that's
[6841.18s -> 6857.54s]  bad. Just stay in the ropes and I'll be fine. Did he help me? Is he helping me or hurting me?
[6857.62s -> 6871.91s]  Was that a hindrance? I'm so weak. I can barely stand up. I'm just gonna have to use body weight.
[6871.91s -> 6885.70s]  Hit him. Oh, come on, dude. Again. What? I was gonna say no way. Reverse it. Reverse it, please.
[6886.73s -> 6904.78s]  Reverse it. He's holding me for way too long. Oh, come on. What's that guy's name? Schmo? Oh,
[6904.78s -> 6923.88s]  you're fucked now. What the hell did I let go for? Come on. Get in here. Get in here. Oh god,
[6923.88s -> 6932.38s]  he elbowed me and I fell down. I don't think I'm gonna win this match. I think it's over. No,
[6932.38s -> 6940.47s]  he's down too. I gotta run. I gotta escape. It's so close. I know. I gotta run away for a minute.
[6940.47s -> 6958.10s]  Take a breather. Good. The bait worked. Holy shit. I actually just fooled him.
[6958.10s -> 6974.55s]  Damn it. I missed. Oh, come on. Hurt him. That's it. No, it's not. Look at how much
[6974.55s -> 6989.59s]  slow I am to get up. I'm trying to get up so fast. Come here, you piece of shit. No. No. Fight it.
[6989.59s -> 6997.61s]  Don't let him beat you. No, he's got me even worse. Oh no, this is horrible. This is
[6997.61s -> 7006.22s]  horrible. I'm passed out right now. I'm dead. I'm not responsive. Good.
[7015.69s -> 7042.94s]  I can't do this. Boom. Shit. Come on. Get up. Get up, please. You're doing such a good job
[7042.94s -> 7050.54s]  distracting for me. I'm not getting up. It's over. I'm at zero. I'm actually at zero health.
[7053.06s -> 7062.14s]  I have to slide out of the ring if I have any chance. Get up. Come on. Coward move. Out. Roll
[7062.14s -> 7076.07s]  out. Oh my fucking God. Why did I do that? Come on, coach. Coach, you're really getting in the way,
[7076.07s -> 7108.17s]  man. That's it. That's it. One, two. Yes. Get out of here. Oh, that was insane. I can't believe it.
[7110.46s -> 7116.30s]  Wackax appears to have been sustained by adrenaline in that match and is suffering from exhaustion
[7116.30s -> 7125.19s]  now that it's over. Okay. Dermis profile has improved considerably by winning at a major event.
[7125.91s -> 7129.75s]  Driver 88's strength has risen to 76% after participating in that match.
[7131.19s -> 7135.51s]  Needles has damaged the reputation of Wrestling Revolution by failing to win that inter-promotional
[7135.51s -> 7149.74s]  contest. Why not get any money? I have to get signed. All right. Come on. Sign me. I got a match
[7149.74s -> 7158.22s]  coming up that I'm not sure I can win on my own. Okay. Would you consider assisting me at the ring
[7158.22s -> 7167.98s]  side? There's $60 in it for you if you do. 60 bucks, man. Let's go. Sure. I was going to come out
[7167.98s -> 7183.43s]  and protect him. I paid $130 for mine. I'll just make sure that he doesn't lose. I got Matt Black
[7183.43s -> 7208.22s]  with Jerma. I can't get in the ring, right? Can I get in the ring? Yeah. And then Burlain with
[7208.22s -> 7229.40s]  Matt Dickey. Oh, it's manager versus manager time. Can I get in? I think I just punched him. Do I have
[7229.40s -> 7236.06s]  to get out? So it's okay. The guy with the bald head. Wait, there's two guys with bald head. Where
[7236.06s -> 7243.70s]  am I? Wait, what's wrong with my character? Matt Dickey, I think. I didn't press any buttons. I'm
[7243.70s -> 7247.83s]  pretty sure Matt Dickey just fell off the ring. I did not press any buttons. I don't even know where
[7247.83s -> 7262.68s]  I am. Where the fuck am I? Where am I? I can't see myself. This is their match. Yeah. I got to make
[7262.68s -> 7302.44s]  sure he wins. Are we under the ring? Where are we fighting? Okay. Holy shit. This is awesome.
[7304.66s -> 7318.89s]  Where are we? Where the fuck did we go? Oh my god. That was cool from here. All right. Where are we?
[7319.93s -> 7350.90s]  Oh shit. There I am. My stomach. I'm here. I made it. Okay. Let's change the camera back to normal.
[7350.90s -> 7359.91s]  What was it called? Hard camera? What was it? Like 70, 80 percent? 60? How much percent zoom was it?
[7360.47s -> 7372.92s]  I don't even know what I have no idea what the actual camera was. All right. I'm coming in.
[7372.92s -> 7385.61s]  How do I go in? I think I fell down again. Where's Matt Dickey? How come I can't go in
[7385.61s -> 7397.50s]  the ring? Oh shit. Look at he's almost dead. Okay. Can I throw a weapon in the ring and hit him?
[7397.50s -> 7406.14s]  Well, what do I care if I get disqualified? That doesn't matter, right? Does that matter
[7406.14s -> 7430.97s]  if I get disqualified? Did I hit the ref? Come on. I got you. Oops. I'm picking up the stairs.
[7432.54s -> 7448.31s]  Here. I'll pass it to you. Right on the chair. And that was legal because he didn't do anything.
[7448.31s -> 7467.30s]  Hit him. Let's go. Hit him. Hey, get down. Get down. Get him down. Get him down. Yeah. I'm not in.
[7467.30s -> 7474.78s]  I'm not in there. This is not illegal for me. All right. Fuck it. I'm going in. Get this motherfucker.
[7474.78s -> 7502.60s]  Get him. Shit. Get in. Fuck. Oh my god. He landed on top of me. Put that down. Put that down. Put.
[7502.60s -> 7513.48s]  Good. Good. Good. Good. All right. Let's kick his ass. Ow. Sorry. All right. This guy's really
[7513.48s -> 7523.00s]  injured. All right. I got him. Get in the ring. Get in the ring. Get in the ring. You're fine.
[7523.00s -> 7526.44s]  Put the bat down and get in the ring. I got it. I got this.
[7526.44s -> 7546.94s]  Why is this guy on permanent two count? Change it to scope? Oh, scope. Player only? Relevant to
[7546.94s -> 7557.61s]  player? Is this relevant to player or contain all? Which one should I do? Player only, right?
[7557.61s -> 7575.64s]  I don't think that matters. Why am I tired? Count him out. I have no idea where M. Dickie is,
[7575.64s -> 7582.95s]  but he's like, I think he's on the ground somewhere. Don't get yourself counted out. Let
[7582.95s -> 7606.06s]  him get counted out. You idiot. Come here. I gotta go find M. Dickie. All right. Camera.
[7607.46s -> 7614.18s]  Bird's eye third person. The third person contain all? No, that's only covering these guys.
[7625.62s -> 7655.90s]  He's on the rope. I'm trying to grab the ref. It's like a superhero jump. All right. Pin him.
[7655.90s -> 7664.81s]  Oh, there's M. Dickie. What are you doing? Why would you just do that? That's a rope break.
[7664.81s -> 7670.58s]  All right. Get him down here. This camera. Fuck. Contain all. There we go.
[7689.54s -> 7707.58s]  Hey, what are you guys thinking about the match so far? Who's getting counted out?
[7707.58s -> 7716.31s]  I don't know who's getting counted out. I think it's this guy. Are we about to win? What's
[7716.31s -> 7724.58s]  happening? Count him out. Yeah. I don't know why you were refereeing this match outlaw eaten
[7724.58s -> 7733.34s]  because you're obviously not qualified. I can't play this game. I'm going to do that every 10
[7733.34s -> 7743.82s]  seconds. It's the biggest mistake of your life. I have to relax. Every time I see something stupid,
[7743.82s -> 7755.61s]  I just like all the air leaves my body. Oh, this is not the game to play. I have to pull
[7755.61s -> 7764.62s]  with a muscle in my neck. God damn it, man. All right. I got to settle down. Relay his damage,
[7764.62s -> 7770.06s]  the reputation of wrestling revolution by failing to win. Matt Black's profile has improved. Okay.
[7772.30s -> 7782.79s]  Matt Dickie is disappointed that his client lost that match. Oh my goodness. People paid
[7782.79s -> 7791.42s]  money to watch that match. Yeah. I think that's worth like five times what the WWE pay reviews
[7791.42s -> 7800.33s]  are. That was insane. Dangal has developed a friendship with Buddy Brew. Oh wait, this is
[7800.33s -> 7805.37s]  Matt Black. Bully Demise walks around like he owns this place and has been making our lives miserable.
[7805.37s -> 7813.80s]  Do you think you could teach him a lesson? There's $80 in it for you if you do. Teach him a lesson.
[7815.96s -> 7827.30s]  Um, why am I this guy's lackey? I don't think I can do... All right. I'll deal with Bully Demise.
[7827.30s -> 7837.88s]  Do I... Can I bring a weapon? I don't have any... I can't. I don't have any health. I need a week of
[7837.88s -> 7846.92s]  rest. You're not part of the solution. You're part of the problem, Jerma. No. What the fuck?
[7849.16s -> 7862.22s]  All right. This is I think big match coming up here. What am I doing? 75, 76, 72, 60. All right.
[7867.93s -> 7879.42s]  Sumo contest. What does that mean? Call me Hawk. Oh, by the way, for those of you that are curious,
[7879.74s -> 7883.98s]  I recognize this name because I think I went into the editor just to check and see what it was like
[7883.98s -> 7888.30s]  and I think I changed his hair. I don't think he looks like this. Like the default character.
[7893.05s -> 7912.60s]  What does sumo match? All right. For a second, I thought that was Tony Batagor.
[7917.06s -> 7926.66s]  I don't understand what a sumo match means. Just throw him over the ropes? What are you doing,
[7926.66s -> 7941.91s]  ref? What's wrong with you? Don't leave the ring. Okay. Five minutes? This guy is like seven or
[7941.91s -> 7949.91s]  eight. That guy's like two feet taller than me. Lance Monaco is coming in. For who? Me? No,
[7949.91s -> 7976.04s]  this guy's a dick. This guy, I don't... Get him out of here. Did I just lose? Come on. What? What
[7976.04s -> 7988.68s]  the fuck? Why did that guy interfere? That's not fair. Tommy Hawk's profile has improved considerably
[7988.68s -> 7993.80s]  by having a guy interfere, walk in the ring, and then I bounce off of his body and fly over the
[7993.80s -> 8007.64s]  ropes. Oh, he generated buzz. Lance Monaco is so popular. What the hell? The doper is complaining
[8007.64s -> 8012.63s]  about cheating. Running short of staff tonight, Jerma. Could you sit in on commentary for the
[8012.63s -> 8022.92s]  next match? Oh, hell yeah. Yes. Oh, absolutely. I will work as a commentator. This is awesome.
[8022.92s -> 8030.73s]  Thanks, Jerma. You just saved the broadcast. Please accept $60 for your time. What do I do?
[8031.62s -> 8050.89s]  It's another sumo contest. John Crockett. That's John Crockett versus in a sumo. I thought he
[8050.89s -> 8059.83s]  just eliminated himself. Versus Wurikusan with Coach Emerson. Okay, same rules. If you go over
[8059.83s -> 8071.69s]  the top rope, you're out. Very cool. So, I am sitting over there. Do I have to... What do I
[8071.69s -> 8078.01s]  have to do? I'm just the commentator? Jerma will be joining us on commentary to share his insights
[8078.01s -> 8085.50s]  in this match. This is awesome. You know what it takes to win. So, how long do you see this match
[8085.50s -> 8093.56s]  going? It will go longer than five minutes. It will take less than five minutes. If it's a sumo
[8093.56s -> 8099.45s]  competition, someone's going over very quickly. It'll take less than five minutes. You heard it
[8099.45s -> 8114.65s]  here first. Jerma thinks this match will be over soon. So, let's find out. Okay. What's this camera?
[8114.65s -> 8127.14s]  Wait, what am I... What the fuck? What's happening? What is happening? Why did I... I didn't mean to
[8127.14s -> 8137.51s]  climb. What? Do I still have to do commentary? No. Get off. Get off. Get off. Get off. Sit back in
[8137.51s -> 8145.70s]  the chair. I got it right. It's over. I got it right. See? The real winner tonight is you, Jerma.
[8145.70s -> 8169.21s]  You predicted this match would be quick. That's right. This... Okay. I'm telling you right now.
[8169.77s -> 8176.73s]  I'm going to make this very clear. This is some of the... This is some of the most fun
[8177.45s -> 8184.07s]  I've had. Just chilling out, playing a video game. I have to be honest with you. It's been a very...
[8184.07s -> 8193.88s]  It's been a while. A very long time. This is fucking fantastic. All right. Yeah, that match was 35
[8193.88s -> 8199.88s]  seconds long. All right. Their profile suffered considerably after incurring a loss at a major
[8199.88s -> 8207.32s]  event. John Crockett's profile has improved. That was so fast. Coach Emerson is disappointed
[8207.32s -> 8218.14s]  that his client lost that match. Shmoke's status is being compromised by the limitations of
[8218.14s -> 8223.91s]  wrestling school. Kylee Barrier's profile has dropped considerably after being criticized by
[8223.91s -> 8231.93s]  the press. What's coming up next? Something on TV? I have actually full health this time, thankfully.
[8234.42s -> 8245.42s]  Okay. What do we got next? Last Man Standing versus David Highbrow. All right. Let's make this one
[8245.42s -> 8276.42s]  quick. You're going to get signed soon? I hope so. Versus Jerma. What are the rules? Last Man
[8276.42s -> 8281.74s]  Standing. Jerma, I'm sure you think winning a fight involves being on top for three precious
[8281.74s -> 8291.30s]  seconds. Well, when you win a real fight, the loser doesn't get up ever again. They kill each
[8291.30s -> 8298.23s]  other? You're about to find that out when only one of us walks out of here in one piece. Share
[8298.23s -> 8304.87s]  him in the face, please. Actually, the three counters there protect my victims. There'll be
[8304.87s -> 8314.87s]  no mercy for you now. Oh, there are no rules? How does she have the chair? Is there no rules?
[8315.51s -> 8340.65s]  All right. There are obviously no rules. Obviously no rules. Going to get weapons. Oh my god.
[8341.13s -> 8364.63s]  Holy shit. That was brutal. Oh, I got to get the table in here. This guy had a lot, talked a lot
[8364.63s -> 8377.82s]  of talk. Holy shit. Okay. I got to get him through the table. Get the table in here. I'm going to
[8377.82s -> 8392.63s]  pile drive him through the table. Come over here. Are you man enough to come over here and get on
[8392.63s -> 8406.84s]  the table? What do you think? Come on over here. Why don't you come face me on the table? Face me
[8406.84s -> 8419.27s]  on the table. Face me on the table, coward. Fine. I'll just put you on the table. Get down here.
[8419.27s -> 8431.54s]  I just punched the thing. All right. Get over here. Give me the shit. Ow. Bring the table into
[8431.54s -> 8447.80s]  the ring. Who does a submission move in like a weapons match? Quest it. I think the ref just
[8447.80s -> 8466.41s]  bit her lip. Oh my god. He caught me. Why does she care? Excuse me. Fight it. There we go. All right.
[8466.41s -> 8474.82s]  Break his neck. The goal is to get the table in the ring, get him on the table and to do a back
[8474.82s -> 8486.01s]  flip on him through the table. I think it has really hurt him. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[8486.01s -> 8496.94s]  no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Shit. No. Come on. That was stupid.
[8498.22s -> 8525.13s]  Can I sit him in the chair? What's the count for? Wait, what's going on? All right. Can I put him
[8525.13s -> 8538.20s]  in the chair? All right. I'm going to put him through the chair. He has to stay on the ground
[8538.20s -> 8554.20s]  for 10 seconds. Oh, okay. I get it. Fight it. He just punched me in the balls. All right. Yeah.
[8554.20s -> 8566.49s]  Whatever. Last man standing. Fine. And you're going to go there? Oh, there's an announcer's table
[8566.49s -> 8601.14s]  over there. Oh, you're down. See you later. I'm not going to let him get up. Stop the match. Hey,
[8601.14s -> 8637.80s]  down. This guy's, this is horrible. Out. No. He was baiting me. Did you see that? That was a,
[8637.80s -> 8645.24s]  that was a fake. I'm going to get the other, I'm getting the announcer's table and put it in here.
[8645.24s -> 8669.86s]  Give me, is he down? Did I win? I won. I killed him. I win. His profile has improved considerably.
[8669.86s -> 8683.78s]  Nice. All right. 78 attitude. David Highbrows is way down. I need to get signed by an actual company
[8683.78s -> 8695.51s]  so I can start bleeding money. While Eaton and and all Cobain have defeated Midwinter and Monica
[8695.51s -> 8702.81s]  Marquez to become the new tag team champions. The ball has defeated Lestat Macabre. I want to
[8702.81s -> 8709.91s]  be a champion. All right. This is it. I've been keeping an eye on your progress and think some
[8709.91s -> 8717.38s]  changes need to be made. I need an agency, right? You're not talented enough to give fans the
[8717.38s -> 8725.98s]  technical wrestling that they pay to see. What? Get your scale up to 79% by the second week of
[8725.98s -> 8732.68s]  October or you'll have to find a different line of work. What? Oh God, what's going on?
[8733.24s -> 8736.60s]  Jeremiah, aren't you tired of pouring your energy into working out for such small gains?
[8737.32s -> 8744.39s]  For just $120, I could hook you up with some steroids so that I give you big results. I
[8744.39s -> 8757.40s]  immediately, immediately after hearing that went to the drug dealer. Okay. What are my stats? 79%
[8757.40s -> 8791.05s]  right? My scale is 80. I'm good. We're good. All right. This is a regular match. I think I have a
[8791.05s -> 8805.24s]  club. Oh no. Tommy Hawk. I got a rivalry with this guy. This is just a singles match. All right. I
[8805.24s -> 8811.29s]  have to beat this guy. I got to just do technical wrestling, beat him, actually play by the rules
[8811.29s -> 8821.21s]  and just win. Lock the medicine cabinet. Jerma is on the prowl looking for his next fix. That's
[8821.21s -> 8827.59s]  unconfirmed. Cat's out of the bag and now everybody knows you're a filthy drug addict. That hasn't
[8827.59s -> 8832.89s]  been confirmed. You brought shame on this sport and everybody who has tried to keep it clean.
[8832.89s -> 8840.70s]  I'm just so sure about that. Why don't you give us a urine sample, Tommy Hawk?
[8845.34s -> 8849.02s]  After I beat the piss out of you, the whole world would get to see who you really are.
[8849.02s -> 8852.46s]  I have to win this. Otherwise I have to do a drug test. I think that's what,
[8852.46s -> 8875.08s]  I think that's what this is implying. Start. Good start. All right. I got to focus here.
[8880.76s -> 8888.50s]  Focus, focus. I don't, I don't know what just happened. Thank you. Ref just helped me
[8889.46s -> 8900.39s]  accidentally. I have to do really light moves on this guy because I can't lift him. I really
[8900.39s -> 8912.42s]  don't think I can lift him up. Nice. Holy shit. What a perfect event. That was unbelievable.
[8912.42s -> 8928.17s]  I almost have my special. A couple more of those and I'm going to put them up.
[8928.17s -> 8947.48s]  Good. Good. Do it. Use it. Idiot. Oh, the fucking reversal. The double reversal. Shit.
[8948.28s -> 8957.82s]  Test of strength. I really am on steroids. Come on. This is it. This is where I can end it. I can
[8957.82s -> 8962.54s]  end it right here if I get an adrenaline rush here. I got it. It's over. Stunner. Good night.
[8963.10s -> 8991.64s]  Pick him up and do it again. Quick. Good night. That's it. Oh, nice try. Don't get too cocky.
[8991.64s -> 9002.58s]  If he wants to leave, let him leave. How did I miss that? How did I miss that? How the fuck
[9002.58s -> 9013.94s]  did I miss that? I went right through him. What the fuck? He's hurt. He's actually hurt.
[9013.94s -> 9022.74s]  I was holding his side pretty hard. If I didn't start with 50% health. God damn it. All right.
[9022.74s -> 9034.31s]  I'm fine. I'm fine. Just relax. Actually exactly where I want to be. Go up. Take the time to gain
[9034.31s -> 9057.75s]  some strength here. Relax. All right. Bring it back. Step on his head. Don't let him grab me.
[9057.75s -> 9069.59s]  That's all I need to know. Watch out. Do some dodging. That was an eye rake if I've ever seen
[9069.59s -> 9101.82s]  one. Oh, get out of here. Here we go. And shit. Move. Consume his fist to gain power. No. Just run
[9101.82s -> 9113.45s]  away. Run away. I'm slowly whittling him down to my level. That was a really good move. Oh,
[9113.45s -> 9129.11s]  come on. Break that rope, please. Again, rope break. Oops. Well, it worked out in my favor.
[9129.11s -> 9147.45s]  It's okay. Watch that return. I don't want him to kick me. All right. Come on. He's getting low.
[9151.90s -> 9173.53s]  Fuck. What? Oh, that cheap little bullshit. Oh, oh, I'm so good. Use it. Use it. Use it on me.
[9173.53s -> 9186.09s]  Use it on me. Use it on me. Use it on me. Oh, god damn it. Get him with a submission. I gotta
[9186.09s -> 9212.71s]  get him on the ground. Got it. Got it. Oh, fuck. Again, on his head. Break the arm. Break the arm.
[9212.71s -> 9226.74s]  Twist it. Come on. Hurt him. I don't want to get a drug test. Do it. Do it. I don't want to take a
[9226.74s -> 9247.14s]  drug test. Twist it. Come on. No. Oh, he's so close. This referee's crotch. Tap out. That's it.
[9248.28s -> 9265.38s]  Yeah. Tommy Hawk's skill has risen to 66%. The ref was just listening to that.
[9267.45s -> 9278.81s]  All right. More stamina. Imagine being the ref and hearing that. What the fuck am I listening to?
[9279.45s -> 9287.19s]  I don't want to take a drug test. No. I have to win. Tap out. I don't want to take a drug test.
[9287.19s -> 9291.19s]  Birdboy has left All-American Wrestling to pursue a career at Super Lucha Libre.
[9291.19s -> 9307.74s]  Jerma appears to have gained weight. The 35-year-old now weighs 247 pounds.
[9309.91s -> 9314.82s]  My skill went down. Jerma has been challenged to increase his skill to 79%
[9314.82s -> 9331.02s]  by the second week of October. Oh my God. How do I lose weight? I can go train. Oh,
[9331.02s -> 9337.13s]  my health is so low. All right. How do I like throw a match? Tables and chairs match versus
[9337.13s -> 9351.22s]  Tommy Hawk. I just beat this guy's ass. Oh God. You gained 80 pounds. Tables and ladders and chairs
[9351.22s -> 9357.08s]  match versus this guy. I'm actually really happy about that because that means I have no health,
[9357.08s -> 9370.31s]  but neither should he. He just tapped out at zero health. Going right for the table already.
[9370.87s -> 9393.66s]  Okay. All right. I can't believe I gained almost 100 pounds. Taking the announcements table.
[9403.96s -> 9407.80s]  We're all holding chairs. Wrestling is a business more than anything else, so it doesn't really
[9407.80s -> 9415.93s]  matter who wins or loses. For instance, if you were to pay me $160, I could make sure this match
[9415.93s -> 9429.75s]  goes your way. Sure, I'll pay you $160. It's a pleasure doing business with you. I'll do everything
[9429.75s -> 9440.94s]  in my power to make sure you win. Okay. Do you think we probably should have did that backstage
[9440.94s -> 9467.34s]  before we got on the ring? Wait, what? Oh my God. Make sure I win. I got to put him through
[9467.34s -> 9475.30s]  that huge thing over there, right? All right. Get over here. Shit. No, I wanted to put him through
[9475.30s -> 9498.94s]  it. Give me that. Give me that. I don't know. I don't care what it is. Oh my God. These eyes
[9498.94s -> 9514.10s]  made him fucking weird. I just fucked him up. Get on that table. Did I? Oh, wait. He broke it.
[9514.10s -> 9527.05s]  He's blocked it. Are you kidding me? I want to get up on there. I need to get him up on here and
[9527.05s -> 9541.85s]  we got to make this. I got to do this. How do I get him up there? Will he come up here?
[9541.85s -> 9555.74s]  Holy shit. I'm so high. Oh my God. Dude, I paid you. I paid you almost $200, man. That's no way
[9555.74s -> 9602.12s]  you're going to do that. Oh, the eye. Oh, fuck. I need to get you up here. Oh, shit. Give me,
[9602.12s -> 9611.58s]  give me, give me, give me. I wonder how you place him on the table. Just give me the chair and I'll
[9611.58s -> 9628.17s]  be fine. All right. Whatever. Whatever. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. Just run. Don't let him.
[9628.17s -> 9646.30s]  We're good. Thank you, ref. I need to do more tables and shit. God damn it. I love how the
[9646.30s -> 9665.80s]  referee is just doing this. Do safe play. Just kill him. Nice catch, dude. In the head. Way more
[9665.80s -> 9679.45s]  damage if it's in the head. Okay. Give me that table. Watch out. Give it to me. Give it to me.
[9679.45s -> 9692.39s]  Give me that table. Let it go. Let that shit go. Eat shit. Let's go. Oh my God. I just, he's done.
[9692.39s -> 9701.83s]  Goodbye. He's dead. It was never any chance of you giving me a fair chance in this match. Outback.
[9701.83s -> 9710.70s]  Are you up already? Next time you want to mess with me, you better be wearing your ring gear.
[9712.58s -> 9733.45s]  That was sick. My profile improved considerably. Uh, Tommy Hawk's profile suffered. I, I, I got
[9733.45s -> 9739.91s]  offered to wrestle for that organization and they never called me back. I've won like seven of my
[9739.91s -> 9748.49s]  last eight matches in a row. I got it. Congratulations, Jerma. You followed my advice and made your
[9748.49s -> 9754.92s]  prospects better than ever. I wish I could offer you a reward, but at this level experience is the
[9754.92s -> 9765.42s]  only reward there is. Okay. Single. Why? I don't want to fight this guy again. Hardcore singles
[9765.42s -> 9773.98s]  match? Why do I have to do this again with Tommy Hawk? He just got paid in exposure. Yeah. Um,
[9775.26s -> 9782.52s]  at what point does this guy leave me alone? Hardcore singles. All right. I'm just going to
[9782.52s -> 9790.30s]  get the chair and he's going to mic this time. There's dynamite over there. I'm just going to
[9790.30s -> 9800.17s]  throw it at him. This guy's my nemesis. Yeah, but just because somebody's your nemesis doesn't mean
[9800.17s -> 9829.26s]  you face them in a match every day. No, actually wait. God damn it. Give me the fucking mic.
[9829.26s -> 9839.90s]  Let's go. All right. What do you have to say? All week we've been polling fans on which match
[9839.90s -> 9851.27s]  they would like to see and they voted for Jerma versus Tommy Hawk in a hardcore match and an
[9851.27s -> 9859.54s]  arcade match. Who can get to a thousand points in Gallagher first? I think I just got hit by the
[9859.54s -> 9877.40s]  bell. He hit me in the face. I'm 90% positive. I'm on the ground right now. Oh, those rules suit
[9877.40s -> 9882.79s]  me perfectly. So it seems these fans want to see you suffer. No, they just felt they had to do
[9882.79s -> 9899.86s]  something this drastic to make one of your matches entertaining. All right. I'm getting the ladder.
[9899.86s -> 9921.75s]  Fuck it. I'm going right for the ladder. What's wrong with this ladder? Holy shit. You suck. Oh
[9921.75s -> 9931.43s]  my God. Get out of the way, ref, please. Oh, I didn't hit me in the face. It bounced back and
[9931.43s -> 9950.52s]  springboarded into my mouth. Great. Excellent. And now I'm like tired. You don't block a chair
[9950.52s -> 9969.53s]  shot like that. You really don't. I got him. Why would I do this? Don't worry. This isn't an
[9969.53s -> 9976.18s]  invasion so much as an Exodus because I'm leaving Maple Leaf Grappling Federation. Oh, are you?
[9976.18s -> 9993.96s]  Cool. I'm seeing stars. I'm not kidding. I have to slow down. This game is going to hurt me.
[9993.96s -> 9998.30s]  I'm actually seeing like stars right now. That all the air just came out of my body again.
[9998.30s -> 10008.15s]  I, I need to pause it. I promised I was going to settle down too. And it just doesn't matter.
[10013.50s -> 10016.70s]  That is just so stupid. Why? Why? This whole scenario is so dumb.
[10022.02s -> 10028.36s]  The guy interrupts the match to tell us that he's changing his, he's leaving this league to go to a
[10028.36s -> 10033.56s]  different league. Get the fuck out of here. Like, what do you do? Why are you here? There's no reason
[10033.56s -> 10040.97s]  for you to do that here. And this guy was so mad about it. I tried to jump. I was on top of the
[10040.97s -> 10047.77s]  ladder and I believe, I believe he pushed me off the ladder, climbed on top of the ladder and was
[10047.77s -> 10052.09s]  so annoyed with what this guy was saying. It jumps off the ladder into him. You know what I mean?
[10052.89s -> 10057.77s]  That whole scenario just makes all the gas leave the body. You know what I mean? Like, what the
[10057.77s -> 10075.70s]  fuck? I'm on the ground. Okay. So, but who is this, who's this, what, I don't know. What's this guy's
[10075.70s -> 10079.94s]  problem? Is he just, he just, I don't, I've no, I can't even describe what's happening. This is
[10079.94s -> 10093.34s]  ridiculous. Oh shit. He's going to pin me. I keep going over that in my head over and over again.
[10096.52s -> 10104.33s]  Um, please, can I have that back? Oh, this is just a fight to who gets to play with the camera.
[10104.89s -> 10119.80s]  Off the ladder. We're going to get some ladder action here. You want to come face me on the
[10119.80s -> 10141.42s]  ladder? Can I hit him? Oh shit. All right. Give it, I gotta get a chair or something. I'm gonna,
[10141.42s -> 10147.56s]  no, I gotta whip him into the, what are you doing? Get the fuck out of here. Why does this guy come
[10147.56s -> 10164.52s]  in the ring? I'm hugging this guy. Whose belt is this? Whose belt is that? A championship belt?
[10168.06s -> 10182.10s]  The camera. Shit. He's videotaping. This is how I felt when I was filming weddings. I used to film
[10182.10s -> 10186.87s]  weddings guys and sometimes you just didn't know what the hell to film, especially during the dance
[10186.87s -> 10191.29s]  stuff. Somebody was always doing something weird and it was like, oh fuck, but do I record like the
[10191.29s -> 10196.33s]  drunk uncle guy, like doing a break dance or should I go like film the bride and groom kissing?
[10196.33s -> 10217.29s]  It was incredibly difficult. I don't even know who I hit. I don't care. This is a, this is a weight.
[10217.29s -> 10229.10s]  Oh God. All right. Here we go. Who is this mustard guy? Why is he in the ring?
[10231.62s -> 10237.40s]  Is this guy in here? Why are you in here? Get out of here. Get the fuck out of the ring. I don't
[10237.40s -> 10257.83s]  even know. Is this guy an audience member? I have to. Five minutes remaining. All right. Here's the
[10257.83s -> 10261.99s]  plan. I'm going to knock him in the head with this and I'm going to go off the top turn buckle and
[10261.99s -> 10294.10s]  spin him. Okay. Let's go. Big splash to end it. Come on. Why is Jordan of his teeth? What are you
[10294.10s -> 10310.25s]  doing? No, this guy is dual welding. Don't let him pin you right now. Don't let him pin you. Come
[10310.25s -> 10332.76s]  on. Get the mounting in here. What's he doing? Fuck. I missed him. Oh my God. I was trying to
[10332.76s -> 10347.08s]  like Sonic roll on him. I'm not going to get up. Balls count anywhere and I'm still on the ground.
[10347.08s -> 10368.63s]  Come on. Don't let him do it. What just happened? I don't know. All right. Get some breath here.
[10368.63s -> 10372.06s]  You're not going to. Oh my God. He did it. I didn't think he was going to do it. I didn't think he was
[10372.06s -> 10378.49s]  going to do it. I didn't think the AI was going to do it. I didn't think the AI was going to do it.
[10378.49s -> 10389.99s]  Nowhere in my brain was the AI actually going to jump off the top rope and do that. I love this
[10389.99s -> 10418.65s]  game. What a fucking mess. I just have to pin him. I hit the mic. Finally. Just pin him. Go. Ref.
[10418.65s -> 10448.54s]  Fuck. Do you see that guy over there? Just looking, just watching this guy was asleep.
[10451.26s -> 10462.57s]  I'm going to get pinned and lose now. This is fantastic. All right. Get up. How has this guy
[10462.57s -> 10470.12s]  gained? I beat this guy's head in with a bench weight. You know what I mean? It's not even
[10470.12s -> 10475.51s]  possible to get up from that. I had it long ways going into his mouth. Like that guy is dead
[10475.51s -> 10496.54s]  in one of those, not five or 10. All right. This is the, this is it right here. You are seriously
[10496.54s -> 10520.23s]  going to fuck this up, aren't you? One minute remaining. Ref. That's it. Oh my God. That's it.
[10520.23s -> 10540.52s]  Pin him. You piece of shit. You got to be fucking kidding me. Don't even. There's only 19 seconds
[10540.52s -> 10574.15s]  left. Ah, what the fuck? Oh my God. No status effects. Tommy Hawk's profile has risen after
[10574.15s -> 10582.14s]  that. Okay. Yeah. He got his ass kicked for 15 straight minutes. Duke Miniman has generated a
[10582.14s -> 10594.04s]  buzz. That was so funny. Oh, that was so stupid. I couldn't have gone any better. I feel like I've
[10594.04s -> 10598.20s]  just been like wheeze laughing this whole time. Like you've all you've gotten is like loud laugh
[10598.20s -> 10605.62s]  sounds. Sharon has received her, renewed her contract. Lola has left Strong Style Wrestling.
[10606.95s -> 10616.79s]  Psycho Kid has left Super Lucha Libre. Okay. Okay. Cameron Cool has been released. He's free agent.
[10617.67s -> 10623.69s]  Cameron Cool has come down with an illness in his poor health this week. What? All right, here we go.
[10623.69s -> 10627.46s]  Remember, don't you ever wish that there was someone in your corner to guide you to victory.
[10627.46s -> 10633.45s]  This is the guy that's been supplying me steroids. So long as you give me my cut,
[10633.45s -> 10643.38s]  I'll make sure you never lose another match. What do you mean my cut? I let the steroid guy
[10643.38s -> 10657.88s]  be my manager, but we need to get signed first. I feel like I need somebody because it's a pretty
[10657.88s -> 10663.11s]  much a coin flip. If somebody's going to interfere with the match, I just grab a microphone, start
[10663.11s -> 10673.46s]  talking, and then attack me. It's 50%. No, it's not. No, fuck off. Yeah, whatever. I can be solo.
[10673.46s -> 10677.77s]  Didn't I take those goggles off? Why are they still on? I can be your best friend or your worst
[10677.77s -> 10683.26s]  enemy. Instead of helping you, now I'm going to make sure you lose every match. Great. That was
[10683.26s -> 10697.59s]  a great idea. Tag team versus Tommy Hawk's team. Training session versus somebody. Nothing scheduled
[10697.59s -> 10713.58s]  here. And then a public show. All right. Well, here comes a tag team. Who's my partner? Lucy Lakes
[10713.58s -> 10731.00s]  and Tommy Hawk. What's wrong with Lucy? Uh, it doesn't look very well. I don't know what to say.
[10734.44s -> 10738.84s]  Cracked out? No, I think she's really tired. I think she has zero health. This should be easy.
[10739.93s -> 10749.61s]  You can't come into the ring with zero health. And Schmoke. Are you kidding me? What?
[10750.57s -> 10758.57s]  When did this alliance happen? He's fucking tired too. Hey, evil corns. Thanks for the 25 community
[10758.57s -> 10777.21s]  subs. He's so tired. You all right? He's sleepy. He said I'm sleepy. What? You all right? I'm sleepy.
[10779.45s -> 10784.44s]  All right. Come on, Schmoke. I'll order. I know you're watching backstage, which is the safest
[10784.44s -> 10791.43s]  place for you to be, but I'll get my hands on you one day. And this is just a preview. What will
[10791.43s -> 10817.43s]  happen? That I just won. Why would you have Lucy Lakes be in first? Ow. What does it mean? What
[10817.43s -> 10824.01s]  does it legal? What do you mean legal? That's a rope break. Uh, dude, that's a rope break.
[10824.01s -> 10842.58s]  What the fuck's going on here? Why is he doing that? Can I tag him in? No. Why would I ever
[10842.58s -> 10868.25s]  tag him in? I can make sure he can't tag anybody. Fuck. Ah, fuck. I'm so tired. Here we go. All
[10868.25s -> 10876.50s]  right. I'm going to do some more moves. I have like an up B. I have a down B. What's he doing?
[10876.50s -> 10898.47s]  Why is there always a table too? We go. Nice move. Come up. Bring it together. I need more.
[10898.47s -> 10912.73s]  I need chain wrestling. Holy shit. Oh my God. Lucy Lakes. What the fuck was that?
[10912.73s -> 10940.15s]  Oh, where are you going? All right. Pick them up. Chain wrestling. Let's go. I'm going to do up.
[10940.15s -> 10951.77s]  I'm going to do left B and I'm going to go down B. Oh, it's the kick move. Okay. I hurt my back
[10951.77s -> 10963.80s]  doing that. Nice. All right. I'm going to have my special. This should be pretty easy. Submission.
[10963.80s -> 10978.87s]  Yeah. Let's do a submission. Smoke. Smoke. Grab him. Smoke. Smoke. Do something. Smoke.
[10983.67s -> 10997.43s]  What's going on? All right. I'm tagging in smoke. How do I tag him in? Where is he? All right. Smoke.
[10997.43s -> 11013.69s]  Let's go. How do I tag in smoke? Come on in smoke. Do your thing. Box him. Holy shit. He's like a
[11013.69s -> 11025.26s]  champion boxer. Get off the top turn buckle. Can I just go over there? I'm just going to go over
[11025.26s -> 11043.58s]  there and just pull her down. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. All right. I'm leaving. I'm leaving.
[11043.58s -> 11046.94s]  I'm leaving. I'm leaving. I'm trying to leave. I'm literally trying to get out of the ring right
[11046.94s -> 11072.76s]  now. Get him. You idiot. Tag me in. Tag me in. Come here. Tag me in. Tag me in. Tag me in.
[11072.76s -> 11084.60s]  Old man. You're all washed up now. Come on. Tag me in. Good job. This is it. Wait. It's okay.
[11084.60s -> 11114.74s]  Here we go. Game over. Count it. Count it. What's with the slow ass counts? Count it. What the
[11126.55s -> 11131.88s]  This ref is paid off guaranteed by them. Like I did. Remember that time I did that?
[11131.88s -> 11151.96s]  Boop slam. I'm going to have my special in a second. I don't know what I'm doing here with
[11151.96s -> 11169.66s]  this guy, but I'm... Holy shit. I got my special in a second. Oh, it's over. It's over. Stunner.
[11169.66s -> 11183.38s]  That's it. That was a one count. I don't know how. What happened? That was a one count.
[11183.38s -> 11193.85s]  Come on. Shmo. You got to do something. Whatever his name is. Shmork? What's this guy's name?
[11195.82s -> 11224.74s]  What? So that was a total screw job is what happened. Um, well, maybe I guess I deserve that.
[11224.74s -> 11246.17s]  Omnihoc Stamin has risen to 80% of participating. Yeah. Great. Lucy Lake with zero HP. One, two,
[11246.17s -> 11252.31s]  three. Now what? We're running short of staff tonight. Could you sit in on commentary? Oh,
[11252.31s -> 11258.46s]  I love this. Yes. Absolutely. Let's go. I need a contract. I've been in wrestling school for three
[11258.46s -> 11275.69s]  hours. What the hell? Winston Barker and John Crockett. I turned the contract down. I didn't
[11275.69s -> 11286.34s]  think that was going to be the only one ever. I taunt. No, I'm not going to do anything stupid
[11286.34s -> 11290.39s]  this time. I'm just going to actually commentate. I'm not going to get up and like punch the guy
[11290.39s -> 11307.72s]  next to me. I didn't even know it was possible. So what, what was this match type? Is this just
[11307.72s -> 11313.50s]  a singles match or what? It's a sumo match. Okay. I'm going to say this is going to be really,
[11313.50s -> 11321.67s]  really, really early. If that's the thing that he's going to ask. Okay. You know what it takes
[11321.67s -> 11325.99s]  to win. How long do you see this match going? It's the same thing. The AI is just so dumb.
[11325.99s -> 11329.67s]  They're going to get too close to the ropes and bump into each other. Less than five minutes.
[11337.40s -> 11342.10s]  Commentating to no one. Well, there's a broadcast at home. Holy shit. The announcer.
[11342.82s -> 11350.84s]  That was the guy announcing the game. I think, was that the guy that was like doing,
[11350.84s -> 11358.55s]  ladies and gentlemen. Okay. Five minutes. It's going to have, it's going to be over right now.
[11358.55s -> 11370.23s]  What's the guy looking at? Why are you looking at me? Quit looking at me. I got,
[11370.23s -> 11386.52s]  I got my money on, uh, why is the guy staring at me? Gotta go over the top ropes. He's going
[11386.52s -> 11402.18s]  over right now. It's over. Oh shit. He went the wrong way. I was just staring at John Crockett.
[11402.42s -> 11408.39s]  I, I, can I, can I do like commentary? No, we just sit here and watch. Unless I want to go
[11408.39s -> 11418.71s]  interfere and be an asshole. Get in there. No, not yet. Unless I have to. I need to get popularity.
[11418.71s -> 11444.36s]  People hate me. I keep losing respect. Ref versus the ring announcer. It's okay to be hated. Who
[11444.36s -> 11454.39s]  are the contestants? Russell Haystacks and who's the other one? Roland Wiener. Off the ropes we
[11454.39s -> 11460.23s]  have, uh, Haystacks going into the corner here. No, going outside. Referee now and Coach Emerson
[11460.23s -> 11465.56s]  decides and the ring announcer at the same time coming in the ring. Doug Turner now has got
[11465.56s -> 11470.52s]  Haystacks by the waist as we have a little bit of an altercation outside as Haystacks misses the
[11470.52s -> 11475.64s]  grapple going into the referee. But no, it seems like Coach Emerson has some type of barbell in
[11475.64s -> 11479.66s]  his hand and the ring announcer seem to be climbing the ropes and going down at the same
[11479.66s -> 11484.34s]  time. Maybe practice seems exercising. Good workout for you calves and your hamstrings.
[11484.98s -> 11493.16s]  Into the ring goes the barbell as Haystacks now big right slap into the face of Haystacks.
[11493.16s -> 11494.92s]  And that's it, ladies and gentlemen. That's going to be, no, it's not.
[11503.05s -> 11510.44s]  He almost eliminated himself, it seems. As we have these two guys are just freaking me out.
[11510.44s -> 11519.16s]  They just keep doing this. That would have been so funny. Rope break there as the ring announcer is
[11519.16s -> 11526.95s]  still very angry with the referee. Watch out for that bell there as Haystacks comes into
[11526.95s -> 11531.13s]  Roland Wiener and he gets caught with an arm bar. Referee is going to probably try to break this
[11531.13s -> 11537.91s]  one up. No, there he is again. You know what? Hold on a minute. It seems like German 985 has
[11537.91s -> 11544.55s]  decided he's going to get up from his chair and he is walking over towards Roland Wiener right now.
[11544.55s -> 11549.61s]  Or John Crockett. I believe it's John Crockett who German 985 is going to be walking over towards.
[11550.74s -> 11554.90s]  As he gets close enough, German 985 I believe is going to, looks like he's getting a,
[11554.90s -> 11558.74s]  he's going to do a spinning punch right into John Crockett. There goes John Crockett now.
[11559.38s -> 11564.12s]  On the ground, German 985 has decided that that is going to be the place he's going to go. Another
[11564.12s -> 11573.82s]  right hand onto John Crockett. Roland gets grabbed by the arm and is getting his arm bent backwards
[11573.82s -> 11579.74s]  out while he's, while Roland has just grabbed him and tossed him over the side arm bar.
[11579.74s -> 11589.96s]  Oh, I don't even know what just happened. I thought it was a sumo match. He's still
[11589.96s -> 11600.70s]  holding on to me. I'm losing health for this, aren't I? This is supposed to be a like relaxing
[11600.70s -> 11608.49s]  day. Doug Turner's status has not been affected. Winston Barker, it's improved.
[11608.49s -> 11620.04s]  Emerton's disappointed. Okay. The Women's Champion. Alright, now what? I've been keeping
[11620.04s -> 11623.56s]  an eye on your progress and I think some changes need to be made. Well, give me a contract so I can
[11623.56s -> 11629.64s]  work for something. You need better attitude to help with what we're trying to build here.
[11630.20s -> 11634.41s]  Improve your attitude to 78% by the second week in November or give your spot to someone who
[11634.41s -> 11641.61s]  appreciates it. All right. Confrontation versus Schmoke. Well, this does make sense because he
[11641.61s -> 11648.18s]  just screwed me in the last match, which is completely unfortunate. What's going on here?
[11648.82s -> 11657.40s]  Ugging Lucy Lake pretending to be my tag team partner, paying the ref? That was a 3v1. That
[11657.40s -> 11672.63s]  wasn't fair. What does he have to say? Wasn't I friends with this guy in the beginning of the
[11672.63s -> 11702.65s]  game? Why did that change? I'm not going anywhere without a weapon. That guy's a ladder. I'm not
[11702.65s -> 11710.10s]  making that mistake. All right. What do you have to say? You made me look bad for the last time,
[11710.10s -> 11715.50s]  German. Why should I tolerate failure? When you cost me a win, if I didn't know better,
[11715.50s -> 11718.86s]  I'd say you were doing it on purpose. Betrayal is the only way you could have hurt anybody.
[11718.86s -> 11725.99s]  You betrayed me. We all make mistakes, Schmoke, and agreeing to work with you was my biggest.
[11725.99s -> 11734.70s]  What defines us is what happens next. And you'll need another excuse after I cost you this win.
[11739.93s -> 11745.34s]  And why is that legal again? Why is that legal again? And why is it legal for him to have like
[11745.34s -> 11770.78s]  a stepladder? Get away from me. Get away from me. We were friends, Schmoke. We could have been good
[11770.78s -> 11778.79s]  friends. But instead, you had to be the traitor. And then you paint me as the traitor. That's
[11778.79s -> 11792.68s]  bullshit. I'm sorry, but I have to do this. American Psycho? It's hip to be square.
[11792.68s -> 11804.84s]  It's hip to be square. Hey, Paul! I'll fight my friends a minute soon. I'll watch them on TV.
[11814.94s -> 11827.43s]  What just happened? I knocked out Schmoke in one minute. Schmoke's profile suffered. I don't have
[11827.43s -> 11839.99s]  any friends. I need to make my attitude better though. Okay. More happenings in the league.
[11840.79s -> 11845.48s]  German has been challenged to increase his attitude. What am I with it right now? 75?
[11846.12s -> 11851.62s]  This is my only friend. Why are you hanging out with people like Outback? I thought I was the only
[11851.62s -> 11860.26s]  friend you needed, Germo. Why are you gatekeeping me from having friends? I need to see other people.
[11862.28s -> 11867.35s]  I'm not even friends with Outback. You got weird information. I don't even know who that is.
[11872.15s -> 11877.56s]  I don't even know what he's talking about. I'm glad to hear it, Germo. We can't allow anybody
[11877.56s -> 11891.59s]  else to come between us. Okay. This guy's... I don't like this guy. My attitude. Can I make...
[11891.59s -> 11905.43s]  I can't make my attitude better. How do I increase my attitude? What do I do? I have this match
[11905.43s -> 11926.18s]  coming up next. Go to relationships. Story enemy is now Outback. Real enemy is Outback. Why do you
[11926.18s -> 11937.45s]  think I was my friend? This guy hates me. It's RNG based. You basically lost. Oh, did I? I'm
[11937.45s -> 11944.78s]  sorry. I'm proceeding. Did I do any... Wait. I at least should level up like strength or something,
[11944.78s -> 11963.18s]  right? How do I get a better attitude? 75%. I did it. No, I didn't. Did I? What did I need? 78.
[11963.74s -> 11978.49s]  Shit. Okay. Oh, I'm in trouble. Germo's been challenged. 78. All right. I think I have...
[11978.49s -> 12000.87s]  I mean, even if I lose this match, I need to get that attitude up. Come on. Fuck. Shoot,
[12000.87s -> 12024.01s]  fight versus... Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on? Shoot, fight. Okay. I'm so tired now.
[12026.28s -> 12056.47s]  Oh my God. This is in an octagon. I can't even climb the ring. Wait, is the... Do I just have to
[12056.47s -> 12068.52s]  leave the ring? You won't have to worry about attitude when you're dead. I still think I can
[12068.52s -> 12077.16s]  beat this guy. Taking the chair from... Okay. I thought he was... I thought the guy was still
[12077.16s -> 12081.83s]  sitting in it and he was going to bring him in with a guy sitting in the chair. Fall down, please.
[12082.55s -> 12094.46s]  I just took the mic from his hand. There's nowhere to run now that I got you locked in.
[12094.46s -> 12097.10s]  Only one of us is getting out of here in one piece and it's not going to be you.
[12097.66s -> 12104.17s]  I'm not locked in here with you. You're locked in here with me. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God.
[12104.17s -> 12108.98s]  Get me out. Get me out. Get me out. Get me out. Get me out of the ring. Get me out. Get me out.
[12116.22s -> 12120.38s]  Is he going to climb in here? This guy sucks. Actually, this guy might actually be the thing
[12120.38s -> 12142.84s]  that helps me. I think... God, here he comes. No. My attitude is down. I'm dead. It's over.
[12149.24s -> 12153.24s]  I need to... We're running short on staff, Terma. Can I count on you to referee one of the matches?
[12154.76s -> 12167.61s]  Yes, this is my last chance. Can I get my attitude up? It's a singles match. I'm the referee. What
[12167.61s -> 12198.54s]  if I do a really good job? I still have two weeks? I'm so tired. Master Chrome. He's going... He's
[12198.54s -> 12206.86s]  going for another hug. Oh, this is the organization that I could have worked for. Look at how well they
[12206.86s -> 12218.54s]  treat each other. God damn it. Get out. You have to get out of here. Stay out of the ring. I want
[12218.54s -> 12244.70s]  a clean fight. Easy. All right. Oh, right. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[12247.38s -> 12261.11s]  Get this illegal item out of the ring, please. All right. Go on. Are you okay? You okay? You
[12261.11s -> 12271.21s]  okay? Are you okay? How you doing? Are you okay? Are you okay? Are you all right? You okay? Sorry.
[12271.21s -> 12292.41s]  That looked fun. Put that down. I got to make this interesting. How you doing? Why does this guy
[12292.41s -> 12314.97s]  have so much more health than the other guy? What happens if he doesn't get up? All right. Get out.
[12314.97s -> 12325.34s]  Excuse me. You're not supposed to be in here. I said get out. Coach Emerson, you're... You're
[12325.34s -> 12335.82s]  out of here. I kind of want the guy with less health to win because I don't know,
[12335.82s -> 12343.88s]  it's more interesting to me. Let's see if I can like bait them into doing stupid things.
[12343.88s -> 12359.40s]  What if I put a table in here? Where's the table? Where's the table? I need to find the table.
[12362.09s -> 12374.09s]  Trash can lid. Get off the... All right. Now you're just being goofy. Hey, what are you doing in here?
[12374.09s -> 12384.26s]  Get out. Leave. Leave. This guy is just acting like a toddler. I think this guy tapped out already
[12384.26s -> 12392.70s]  like three times. Okay, so I can disqualify people but will I be disqualified from refereeing if I
[12392.70s -> 12421.53s]  do this? No. It's an illegal item. Excuse me. What the fuck? How do you do that? Holy shit,
[12421.53s -> 12433.32s]  he got me a seat. This is awesome. Oh wait, hold on. I got a better idea. It's time to be the world
[12433.32s -> 12444.41s]  shittiest rep. Excuse me. Well, you knocked me down. I can't even count. How am I supposed to
[12444.41s -> 12464.71s]  count when you knock me down and I'm not even ready? I really hope that nobody does anything
[12464.71s -> 12478.90s]  illegal behind me. It would be such a shame if somebody were to do something illegal. Work. I
[12478.90s -> 12487.78s]  feel like I'm watching my son at the playground. Hey, hey, get out of here. You're not supposed to
[12487.78s -> 12500.44s]  be in here, man. Oh, whatever. I don't fucking care. Just don't do anything dumb. World's worst
[12500.44s -> 12536.66s]  lifeguard. What am I doing? Shit, I'm trying to jump over the ropes. Count. Oh, right. One, two,
[12536.66s -> 12567.16s]  three, four. I forgot I was supposed to count. Oh, right. Whoops. Come on, give me some reputation.
[12567.16s -> 12584.71s]  Give me some attitude. Seventy-nine attitude. Seventy-eight. Come on. Shit. Yeah. Oh,
[12584.71s -> 12593.11s]  there has been challenged and I don't think I got it. Oh, I'm in trouble now. I don't know what to
[12593.11s -> 12605.69s]  do to make my attitude better. I can cheat? What do you mean cheat? I can't cheat. What, a database?
[12605.69s -> 12617.94s]  Just take drugs. I can't take any more drugs. I took drugs a bunch. You don't have to make every
[12617.94s -> 12629.42s]  goal. Oh, okay. I'm going to just rest up. Go back to the main menu and edit the universe.
[12630.14s -> 12649.98s]  I guess I could do that. Oh, I failed. I'm afraid this is the end of the road for you. Maybe you'll
[12649.98s -> 12657.03s]  put more effort into your next big idea. After 17 weeks, Jerma has retired from wrestling at the age
[12657.03s -> 12663.99s]  of 35 with meager savings of $2,900. He only ever worked for wrestling school where he won 50% of
[12663.99s -> 12689.02s]  his 12 matches. Shit. I'm gone from the roster. I actually don't exist anymore. I gotta try. Now
[12689.02s -> 12698.42s]  that I know how this game works, I'm going to make a new character. All right. Wrestling school.
[12698.42s -> 12706.14s]  We're going to do C Breeze. We'll be a good guy this time. I gotta go pee. I'll be right back.
[12706.14s -> 13045.59s]  We're going to do another career. I'll be right back. I'm back. Oh, man. This is definitely not
[13045.59s -> 13060.07s]  the game to play after I like pulling muscles and I like right middle shoulder into my lower rib
[13060.15s -> 13063.99s]  is on fire right now, but it's worth it. This is so fucking funny.
[13070.02s -> 13078.41s]  Yeah, this is, this is an absolute 100% buy. Like this is a run to buy this
[13079.05s -> 13090.34s]  in my opinion so far. It's just fun. It's funny. Oh, all right. So let's cut back over here.
[13094.81s -> 13098.33s]  So who I don't want to be me this time. I want to be a huge person.
[13098.33s -> 13106.97s]  Let's do that first. I want to be like seven feet tall. Should I be 710 and 500 pounds?
[13108.14s -> 13114.84s]  Okay. I'm going to be 525 pounds. I'm going to be absolutely massive. I'm going to be like 20.
[13114.84s -> 13129.05s]  You know what I mean? Like 24, 25. Not even on the screen. All right. Let me, I gotta slow down a
[13129.05s -> 13142.34s]  little. Let me see my character. Okay. Hair. Oh shit. Okay. I gotta mute this. Should I put
[13142.34s -> 13158.20s]  the Terraria soundtrack back on? Let me put the Terraria soundtrack on. I think it's still open.
[13158.20s -> 13193.74s]  It is. Make him tiny. I think he's got to be huge. About like a huge Elvis. Make him really skinny.
[13203.75s -> 13220.90s]  I kind of like that face. Do you have like the weird like melted chin? I kind of like that.
[13223.53s -> 13245.78s]  This is scuffed Johnny Cage. Mr. Satan. Holy shit. What a great idea. What does Mr. Satan look like?
[13255.46s -> 13271.56s]  Is this a Batman game? What is Mr. Satan? I gotta get a picture of Mr. Satan. He's an online reference.
[13271.56s -> 13283.10s]  Mr. Satan is a big mustache. It's kind of like got a bald, but it's like an Afro.
[13284.14s -> 13297.08s]  Okay. Let me see. I do a big mustache. There it is. That's actually not bad already.
[13297.08s -> 13323.86s]  I think that's it here. Holy shit. It's Mr. Satan.
[13329.88s -> 13337.66s]  I'm the strongest man in the world. I tell you that much.
[13338.70s -> 13367.98s]  Okay. Beard. He needs... Okay. Glasses off. It's not really Mr. Satan. Hold on. That's kind of...

[13424.58s -> 13442.54s]  And he has... He's got like the cape, right? Can you do a cape? Oh, wait a minute. He's got...
[13443.66s -> 13464.02s]  Wait. Doesn't he have that? No. He has sideburns. Okay. He's got like a ripped chest.
[13464.02s -> 13490.01s]  Yeah. It's ripped. Okay. Over pattern. Zero. A cape. Oh, that's... Is that as close as we're
[13490.01s -> 13512.04s]  going to get? It's 23. All right. Remember 23. 23. Yeah. It's 23. Okay. And what color is the cape?
[13512.04s -> 13534.87s]  It's almost like a pale purple. I think it's purple. Wait. What? Oh, there we go. Red and blue.
[13534.87s -> 13549.86s]  Not even changing color. Oh, okay. There we go. All right. It's like a pale purple. It's like this.
[13550.82s -> 13563.22s]  Right? Like that. Okay. What does he have? I need like a full picture of him. He also kind of has
[13566.06s -> 13591.03s]  white. It looks purple here. It is white. Why is it purple in this one? Okay. Um, and I'm going to
[13591.03s -> 13600.36s]  try really hard. I'm going to actually try to win every game because super sucks. What does he have
[13600.36s -> 13613.46s]  for pants? He's got these like kind of fuchsia boots with white. Is that Otto? Hold on. Let me
[13613.46s -> 13643.53s]  get Otto. Okay. There he is. He wanted to come in and hang out. All right. So now we need
[13644.86s -> 13663.37s]  a, uh, that looks fine. Now we need pants are everything goes arm. It kind of like baggy pants
[13664.01s -> 13678.71s]  and they're white. That baggy. Oh, those are too baggy. That's fine. All right. These are white.
[13679.43s -> 13690.12s]  Tell Otto chat says hi. Hey, Otto at says hi. Doesn't he doesn't speak any. He doesn't speak
[13690.12s -> 13703.11s]  English. Okay. All the boots, the boots are tucked in actually. Yeah, they're tucked.
[13706.49s -> 13721.69s]  Those look good, but I need them to be purple, at least a little bit. He's got like fuchsia lines
[13722.49s -> 13731.51s]  and the materials got to change. Is there a split one? There we go. All right.
[13733.21s -> 13741.51s]  How do I change this color? Here it is. All right. I was going to flip it.
[13748.76s -> 13761.75s]  Damn it. This is probably as close as I'm going to be able to get this. It's just reversed. Look on
[13761.75s -> 13783.02s]  the shape option in shirts to change the Cape. Okay. All right. There we go. A little more purple.
[13783.66s -> 13794.49s]  All right. That's good. They're not that purple though. They're like a like almost like a maroon.
[13798.71s -> 13816.60s]  I can't really, there it is. Okay. That's better like that. Now let's do the person that goes
[13816.60s -> 13832.54s]  shirts and then shape. Oh, I see what you mean. Okay. Baggy baggy baggy baggy. That's fatter.
[13839.86s -> 13842.26s]  His body is baggy. Yeah. What?
[13849.50s -> 13863.91s]  Okay. Like I kind of like that. Cool. All right. That's fine. His skin is going over his pants and
[13863.91s -> 13879.93s]  tucking into his pants. All right. Cool. The hair needs to be a little lighter. Maybe a little bit
[13879.93s -> 13893.34s]  of variation. No, I can't do any big extensions on this. No, I can't. All right. Texture. What
[13893.34s -> 13917.67s]  about the texture? Is that fine? Oh, it's good. It is a curly texture. It doesn't look like there
[13917.67s -> 13926.49s]  is. It's just good. I mean, that's he's kind of balding in this one. Is that actually the one
[13926.49s -> 13945.77s]  we're going to use? I kind of it's the only one. There we go. That's like darker. He needs chest
[13945.77s -> 13973.56s]  hair. Why are there crumbs in his chest? Well, that's the only one I can do. Wait, I don't want
[13973.56s -> 13993.05s]  tattoos. Why are there tattoos all over him now? Is it the arms? Why does he have tattoos all over
[13993.05s -> 14000.62s]  his arm? Oh, there we go. Okay. Oh, wait. I could like add this and make this part of the Cape,
[14000.62s -> 14006.68s]  couldn't I? That's just the Cape, right? Oh, yeah. Look at that. This is just part of the Cape.
[14006.68s -> 14024.76s]  There we go. This would be the same material, though. At least close enough.
[14031.83s -> 14060.25s]  Material two? Material two. It doesn't have wristbands. Does he have gloves? That's not bad.
[14060.25s -> 14074.71s]  That looks more like a Cape. And I got to make the material the same thing. I'm going to sneeze.
[14081.30s -> 14098.41s]  Collar. Yep. That's fine. That's good. All right. Mr. Satan. I'm going to sneeze again, I think.
[14098.89s -> 14103.21s]  I'm trying not to. I'm going to mute. That's the perfect time. I just, I think I fixed it.
[14110.36s -> 14145.67s]  Okay. Legs. That's fine. That hair is awful. I know it is. What about this one? No. I don't
[14145.67s -> 14153.11s]  know which the closest one. No bald spot. No bald spot. All right. All right. This one,

[14160.62s -> 14178.81s]  bigger. Yeah. How big is Mr. Satan? He's at least like seven feet tall, right? Look it up. All
[14178.81s -> 14198.54s]  right. How tall is Mr. Satan? Mr. Satan is 6'2". What? How old is he? I thought this was like a
[14198.54s -> 14212.84s]  typo. He's 736 years old. What the fuck are they talking about? I'm not going to make him that.
[14215.03s -> 14229.37s]  How about 7'2"? He needs to be big and imposing. All right. I'm happy with it. All right. Casual.
[14231.03s -> 14243.02s]  I don't, whatever. It doesn't matter. I don't, it doesn't matter. No, I just changed his body.

[14354.06s -> 14373.85s]  Would it be martial arts? Powerful. Oh yeah. He would be standing very tall. Right, right, right.

[14439.05s -> 14453.18s]  And middle finger. Middle fingers. All right. Attacks. What does he do? What does he even do?
[14454.18s -> 14474.71s]  Big uppercut. He actually did do the middle finger in the Japanese version. He did. Drop kick is good.

[14484.36s -> 14491.18s]  ultimate move. Because that's what we're going to give him for his special. He had very flashy

[14516.71s -> 14545.05s]  That one's sick too. Top rope attack. Look at that one. That's huge. I like, um, super punch. Yep.
[14545.05s -> 14554.01s]  All right. Crushes. These can be pretty normal. Stomp is fine. Leg drop is fine. Running when
[14554.01s -> 14560.57s]  they're on the ground. Double stomp. That sounds good. Flying in the air when they're on the ground.
[14560.57s -> 14571.29s]  How about just like a big splash? We'll go give him a senton bomb. Five star splash. All right.
[14571.29s -> 14582.42s]  So top rope when they're on the ground. Give him dynamite as the prop. I'm hurting the training
[14582.42s -> 14601.53s]  dummy here. You see that? Okay. Here we go. Now these are important. I want to look at the specials.

[15403.22s -> 15412.23s]  now that's how you really get a battle going I don't think I ever trained with no truth did you
[15427.58s -> 15433.88s]  all right so what happened last time remember last time when I played it went the full duration

[15447.22s -> 15467.14s]  like that oh it's time it's time what's the special move oh he's punching with the balls
[15467.14s -> 15489.62s]  that move sucks what a terrible finisher that's not gonna win me any matches that's awful all
[15489.62s -> 15514.23s]  right this is he's done oh my god this sucks that would be so painful he's not tapping out though so
[15514.23s -> 15539.78s]  I mean I'm gonna keep doing it I'm pulling him so far back I have the ref too oh my god dude
[15540.90s -> 15545.72s]  I don't think he can tap out I don't think he's physically able to I don't think he's conscious
[15550.76s -> 15580.17s]  what happened this guy I'm gonna injure this guy all right can I pin him I just pin him
[15580.97s -> 15603.91s]  I gotta end this all right I'm gonna end up with a super kick ruining him yeah good night
[15606.98s -> 15627.02s]  two three that's so rude all right so I just like ended that guy's career Mr. Satan's profile has
[15627.02s -> 15638.02s]  improved considerably by winning convincingly in that that man Buddy Lee has renewed his contract
[15638.02s -> 15650.50s]  all right are I thought this had a hard gamer okay nothing is scheduled so let's just you know
[15650.50s -> 15655.69s]  what if nothing's scheduled I'm gonna go ahead and just do some let's do some strength training

[15685.05s -> 15696.36s]  considered changing the strikes in your arsenal oh I like the way that I fight all right I can't
[15696.36s -> 15703.72s]  tell you how to fight I just thought you might want to mix things up a little singles versus
[15703.72s -> 15714.46s]  Tate Madison let's go another person just to absolutely decimate this guy doesn't look
[15714.46s -> 15753.00s]  finished um all right score Ben I know you're cowering backstage clinging that undergraduate
[15753.00s -> 15761.26s]  title of yours that may be the safest place for you right now but that treasure can't stay there
[15764.78s -> 15769.10s]  I want you to pay attention to what happens in this match because you're next
[15772.34s -> 15797.86s]  oh I thought he's beat me oh my god I got him from behind again why is it ref holding the
[15797.86s -> 15860.87s]  microphone like put it down bro perfect suplex what oh wait that's illegal what did I just do
[15861.43s -> 15886.97s]  all right don't fuck this up he's done what are you thinking dude are you serious I'll get you
[15886.97s -> 15905.11s]  every time why is it what's referee what are you doing that Mr. Satan is way better than
[15905.11s -> 15911.82s]  German 985 was this German at five was awful in comparison look how much cleaner these matches
[15911.82s -> 15928.34s]  are and it's not even a stats thing I think the stats got reset didn't they again one two three
[15938.42s -> 15952.55s]  just like a DBZ fight oh my god oh my god that was horrible that was fucking horrible
[15960.15s -> 15969.00s]  that's making me that's making me cringe backwards this guy's actually a formidable
[15969.00s -> 15995.69s]  foe get up all right let's do this one again I don't know what just happened but I think I won
[15996.49s -> 16008.07s]  I think I did a good job there bring the frame rate down on the screen to make it look like a
[16008.07s -> 16016.95s]  DBZ fight what's he doing wait do I have him or does he have me I can't tell I think I had him
[16025.77s -> 16051.70s]  oh that felt good I wanted to go off the ropes all right this match is over holy shit all right
[16051.70s -> 16069.48s]  pin him again again can I catch him with that you get you get to get one move on me that's fine
[16069.48s -> 16082.73s]  now you don't even get one move pin him hate Madison please get up that's not gonna happen
[16082.73s -> 16102.97s]  all right let's break his neck I want to hear those crunches that's it yeah it's it's over
[16103.05s -> 16117.29s]  there's literally nowhere for him to go besides to tap up I'm pulling so hard in his head he's got
[16117.29s -> 16127.69s]  resilience you know what I like about this game I like that you okay so see how if I hold down
[16127.69s -> 16138.36s]  the strike button you do like oh or you can just do it lightly there's a range of holding it
[16138.36s -> 16144.44s]  this is honestly the best like actually wrestling video game that I've played since like no mercy
[16144.44s -> 16168.90s]  I really think that this is actually a good wrestling game does this one make sense the
[16168.90s -> 16175.06s]  new wrestling I've tried to play the new WWE games it's kind of confusing and weirdly controlling
[16175.06s -> 16180.82s]  it's like hard to control it's strange hey Mr. Satan everybody knows that decision was bogus
[16180.82s -> 16186.82s]  are you gonna fall down if you had any decency you would agree to restart this match and prove
[16186.82s -> 16194.46s]  that you can beat me properly um sure fine restart the match let's do it again I'll take
[16194.46s -> 16198.30s]  the shit out of you a second time you know the coward I thought you were but we both know the
[16198.30s -> 16218.60s]  result will be different this time are you leaving don't leave this time I'm gonna kill him okay
[16218.60s -> 16225.29s]  let's see how you feel after this one all right it really yeah it's double or nothing this really
[16225.29s -> 16242.10s]  is just me you know what don't let him get away get into the corner never mind he's this is just
[16242.10s -> 16267.27s]  sad count him fucking count him what are you doing are you kidding me oh my god he's broken
[16267.27s -> 16279.67s]  a damn I really want to like break his neck I know that's like fucked up but I mean this guy you
[16279.67s -> 16307.32s]  can't come in twice what is he inspecting oh my god really I just ended he's dead no you're not
[16307.32s -> 16314.12s]  gonna pin me you know what this is so good to be huge because I will rope break 30 to 40 percent
[16314.12s -> 16335.56s]  of every single pin just because I'm big I am all right what's the UFC thing gonna happen where
[16335.56s -> 16353.08s]  the guy just steps in and starts pulls me off him and they have to call this oh let's lose the test
[16353.08s -> 16366.47s]  of strength the guy that's barely standing there's no way this guy is gonna get up after this shit
[16366.47s -> 16392.15s]  I'm sorry why is he still going get the fuck out of here this is supposed to I've fought him
[16392.15s -> 16408.50s]  let's roll my arm I broke his back that's enough stay down what does it take to keep this guy down
[16409.06s -> 16423.46s]  seriously what does it take to keep this idiot down like just stay down that's it
[16427.58s -> 16446.78s]  finally that is counter established mr satan as a heel what why would that make me a heel the guy
[16446.78s -> 16451.74s]  challenged me to a second fight and I kicked his ass again why does that make me a heel doesn't
[16451.74s -> 16466.66s]  that make him just stupid why do I have to be a bad guy because the other guy is dumb because
[16466.66s -> 16472.65s]  he broke his neck four times whatever that did you're gonna challenge me to a double and nothing
[16472.65s -> 16486.73s]  match in the same day it's because you kept hitting him in the balls oh here's this guy again
[16486.73s -> 16490.25s]  hey mr satan don't you ever wish that there was someone in your corner to guide you to victory
[16492.02s -> 16499.08s]  yeah I mean sometimes I do but I heard that you're a real weirdo I want nothing to do with you
[16501.94s -> 16509.34s]  perhaps we can work together some other time I've always got your back if you need it mr satan
[16510.84s -> 16517.06s]  now this is the creepy guy that only wants to have you be his only friend all right four man

[16602.20s -> 16605.64s]  being forced to defend my title against three of their opponents and that's just not fair
[16605.64s -> 16612.58s]  wait this is for the championship I'm not even out of school there's some sort of conspiracy to
[16612.58s -> 16619.59s]  get the title off of me but I didn't become champion in the first place by backing down
[16619.59s -> 16640.97s]  from a challenge this will be just my biggest win yet we're all stopping this guy hey what are you

[17257.54s -> 17264.55s]  Satan and I've had enough of it I don't even know who this guy is why don't we bury the hatchet so
[17264.55s -> 17274.84s]  that we can both get back to concentrating on our careers let's make peace oh this is Samson oh no
[17274.84s -> 17290.50s]  it's the previous champion um oh you go fuck yourself I just remembered why I hate you so
[17290.50s -> 17296.55s]  much I should have known you couldn't be reasoned with oh yeah I'm supposed to be a good guy
[17297.27s -> 17305.96s]  whatever after three for the undergraduate championship versus hard gainer to win with
[17305.96s -> 17347.88s]  with three matches in row yeah wear that shit get a good shot of this ref hard gainer oh it's
[17347.88s -> 17366.70s]  the skeleton guy okay letting you do your own intro is really cool it is for anyone who wasn't
[17366.70s -> 17374.17s]  paying attention I am the new undergraduate champion of wrestling school a lot of people
[17374.17s -> 17381.72s]  thought it would never happen and you ignorant moron should admit that you're wrong I've achieved
[17381.72s -> 17387.72s]  all this without anybody's support so the only person I think is myself doing a 40 to 50 percent
[17387.72s -> 17394.02s]  Mr. Satan so I can do it for a long period of time here if Mr. Satan will change wrestling school
[17394.02s -> 17407.21s]  forever oh that was not fair all right hard gainer let's see what you made of can you handle a
[17407.21s -> 17428.68s]  fucking flurry of punches like this goodbye get a shot of that one oh it seems that Goku
[17428.68s -> 17437.64s]  seems to have fallen down out of the arena join us next time on Dragon Ball Z see what happens Goku

[17468.42s -> 17482.81s]  that's the thing that's more annoying damn that was cool let's do some more stuff off the ropes
[17484.38s -> 17499.32s]  get in that corner all right this guy's fucked now that I got him on the ground let's go oh

[17562.33s -> 17573.05s]  stomp that's kind of a cool move I like that waiting for him this is what Shawn Michaels used
[17573.05s -> 17600.98s]  to do well not in not in that order but you know what point is that like not allowed he's
[17600.98s -> 17618.78s]  counting with the chair the falls again one fall just spin it again stop I didn't I wasn't trying

[17702.04s -> 17706.36s]  you do something can be more important than what you do a few gestures could help you express
[17706.36s -> 17720.50s]  yourself oh he wants me to be nicer sure I can change that's very open-minded of you I look
[17720.50s -> 17733.80s]  forward to seeing the new you um how do I do that all right let's take away the low blow I don't

[17882.84s -> 17891.30s]  illegal I've been where you are now Mr. Satan I remember what it's like to be under the
[17891.30s -> 17898.09s]  undergraduate champion but I've also felt something you can't yet imagine and that's the burning
[17898.09s -> 17906.06s]  desire to claim it back if I have to climb over you to get back to the top of the mountain then
[17906.06s -> 17914.15s]  that's what I'm prepared to do anybody worth of this title would have let it go you were losing
[17914.15s -> 17921.48s]  and score bends and you're losing out it's two o'clock in the morning and I don't want to wake
[17921.48s -> 17925.00s]  up my mother in the other room by doing the mr satan voice so I'm doing a really shitty
[17925.96s -> 17936.95s]  awful version of it put that down wait can we even can we use that is that illegal doesn't say it is
[17950.90s -> 17958.98s]  why do I keep hitting myself in the head why do I keep hitting myself why is this what you want is

[18105.77s -> 18129.51s]  I win oh he suffered considerably considerably mr satan has cemented his reign by defending
[18129.51s -> 18139.18s]  uh the championship again there has to be some reason why maybe if you do it too many times in
[18139.18s -> 18144.78s]  a row you'll just mess up and hit yourself in the face but that it seems to happen all the time
[18145.50s -> 18153.93s]  mr satan's association with matt black has a negative effect on his attitude no it doesn't
[18153.93s -> 18169.13s]  I don't care about that guy why would I care about that guy mr satan why don't you give me

[21907.93s -> 21946.52s]  to look for what if I quit I always skipped it wait can I quit oh thank god okay we're probably
[21946.52s -> 21964.57s]  gonna stop fairly soon anyways but we're gonna have to find a stopping point because my neck
[21964.65s -> 21973.80s]  right now is way worse than it was four or five hours ago that's a guarantee my leg is shoulder
[21973.80s -> 21980.79s]  and chest red light matches means it's red I want to end this as fast as I can because this looks
[21980.79s -> 22005.77s]  I don't like how this looks is everything is anything legal travel all right against ropes
[22005.77s -> 22017.02s]  let's do a grab I just okay well whatever I fucked up this is the virtual boy match yeah it is
[22017.02s -> 22030.55s]  don't you mean the face all right I didn't mean to do that but it's all right it's effective
[22031.11s -> 22051.74s]  just a slight little hip toss keep the chain wrestling going oh just flip three times I'm
[22051.74s -> 22075.37s]  doing the running punch moves the crowd is silent okay same guy that made hard time you know I
[22075.37s -> 22081.88s]  heard of that too I was gonna play these games a while ago and then I finally comes like you

[22087.21s -> 22093.34s]  and I just saw that he was making this remake so I'm like shit do I want to play the
[22094.54s -> 22098.14s]  old one or just wait for him to do the remake and instead was coming out in only a couple months
[22098.78s -> 22104.79s]  I was like well screw it we'll just wait and here we are and this is a special move let's see if we
[22104.79s -> 22119.45s]  can break his neck our time is literally 10 out of 10 you should play it that it happening yeah
[22119.45s -> 22138.92s]  he's oh no our time is like this but it's prison oh I can't even imagine how insane that probably is

[22158.10s -> 22182.46s]  so much blood this guy's trying to get away from me that enough you make an earthquake every time
