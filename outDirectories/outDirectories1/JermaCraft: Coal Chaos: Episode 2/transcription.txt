[2.74s -> 7.14s]  It's not Germacraft unless you have something crazy happen, so I'm gonna go fight this asshole over here.
[7.14s -> 12.38s]  Get this cows too. Do I have- I don't even have a sword.
[12.38s -> 15.42s]  This is gonna be interesting.
[15.42s -> 20.22s]  I should have just made one. I should have just made a sword. What am I doing? Why am I doing this?
[20.22s -> 24.62s]  Why am I going after this guy right now? What is the matter with me?
[24.62s -> 28.97s]  You see, my brain does not work in ways that you would think it should.
[28.97s -> 30.77s]  I'm definitely gonna die.
[30.77s -> 32.77s]  This is the stupidest idea ever.
[32.77s -> 35.77s]  That was the dumbest thing I've ever done in this game.
[35.77s -> 39.29s]  I don't even have a spawn point. Oh, great.
[39.29s -> 42.23s]  At least there's cows.
[42.23s -> 46.33s]  Mountain cows.
[46.33s -> 48.33s]  Whoa. Where's my diving board?
[48.33s -> 50.50s]  Where's my diving board?
[50.50s -> 52.50s]  I made a diving board. Where is it?
[52.50s -> 54.50s]  Oh!
[54.50s -> 56.50s]  Coal! There's coal right there. There's coal right there.
[56.50s -> 58.50s]  Get away from me.
[58.50s -> 60.50s]  Get away from me.
[60.50s -> 62.50s]  Oh, there's three creepers? What are you kidding me?
[62.50s -> 64.50s]  This is insane.
[64.50s -> 67.19s]  What the hell?
[67.19s -> 69.19s]  Come on now.
[69.19s -> 72.39s]  You can't get up here.
[72.39s -> 75.02s]  You know what? Blow up.
[75.02s -> 77.02s]  I dare you. I dare you.
[77.02s -> 80.92s]  Good. I'm right next to you. Blow up.
[80.92s -> 82.92s]  Get out of here.
[82.92s -> 84.92s]  Get the hell away from me.
[84.92s -> 86.92s]  Everybody just blow up right now. Go. Blow up.
[86.92s -> 91.02s]  I want to see the hole that made.
[91.02s -> 93.02s]  Oh, there's my diving board.
[93.02s -> 95.64s]  All right.
[95.64s -> 99.03s]  That actually looks kind of cool.
[99.03s -> 102.04s]  Did I make it? I made it.
[102.04s -> 104.28s]  Wait a second. How did this happen?
[104.28s -> 106.28s]  They're all here too? There's like ten people down here.
[106.28s -> 109.35s]  What is going on?
[109.35s -> 111.35s]  Oh, my God. Oh, hey. More people.
[111.35s -> 113.35s]  Might as well just run off the cliff.
[113.35s -> 118.09s]  Okay.
[118.09s -> 120.09s]  So I've successfully made a hole
[120.09s -> 122.09s]  in my basement.
[122.09s -> 124.09s]  Where I'm hiding from all the things
[124.09s -> 126.09s]  that have been just killing me over and over again.
[126.09s -> 128.39s]  And I'm surrounded
[128.39s -> 130.39s]  right now. By mobs.
[130.39s -> 133.21s]  Oh, my God.
[133.21s -> 135.77s]  Can you hear them all?
[135.77s -> 137.77s]  They're all over the water.
[137.77s -> 140.33s]  I feel like I'm in a Stephen King movie.
[140.33s -> 143.08s]  Shouldn't they be dying right now?
[143.08s -> 145.64s]  Am I missing? Look at all the arrows.
[145.64s -> 147.64s]  My house
[147.64s -> 149.64s]  is riddled with arrows.
[149.64s -> 151.64s]  Oh, my God.
[151.64s -> 154.97s]  It looks like this is like
[154.97s -> 159.38s]  part of the Lord of the Rings set.
[159.38s -> 161.38s]  Why are they not dying? It's bright as
[161.38s -> 164.65s]  hell out. There we go.
[164.65s -> 168.54s]  Now they're on fire.
[168.54s -> 172.70s]  Or are they? They should be.
[172.70s -> 174.70s]  Oh, look at that. Oh, look at this.
[174.70s -> 176.70s]  Oh, what happened?
[176.70s -> 178.70s]  What happened?
[178.70s -> 181.13s]  Did you die?
[181.13s -> 183.75s]  Why is that guy still alive?
[183.75s -> 185.75s]  I'm not going to question that.
[185.75s -> 188.49s]  Whatever.
[188.49s -> 190.49s]  Okay, now let me rethink
[190.49s -> 192.49s]  what I'm doing here. Okay, I've got to collect
[192.49s -> 195.24s]  some of this because I'm an idiot and I died.
[195.24s -> 197.24s]  Just going to get a pickaxe, go down there, get some coal.
[197.24s -> 200.12s]  And I should be good to go.
[200.12s -> 207.14s]  There we are.
[207.14s -> 209.14s]  So while I have the light, I need to do this.
[209.14s -> 214.58s]  Wait, where's my original crafting
[214.58s -> 216.58s]  table? What the hell happened to my crafting table?
[216.58s -> 219.90s]  Whatever.
[219.90s -> 224.57s]  Yeah, I'm crazy if I think.
[224.57s -> 226.57s]  Oh, I'm going to have a castle built.
[226.57s -> 228.57s]  I'm going to have a nice castle
[228.57s -> 230.57s]  built by Christmas time. Yeah, right.
[230.57s -> 233.19s]  Alright, let's find
[233.19s -> 235.19s]  some of this. There's definitely going to be coal down here.
[235.19s -> 237.19s]  I know for a fact there is.
[237.19s -> 239.19s]  They wouldn't have this much crap everywhere without coal
[239.19s -> 241.19s]  being right there.
[241.19s -> 244.46s]  At least I can get some tools, different tools.
[244.46s -> 247.72s]  Listen to that music.
[247.72s -> 249.90s]  More
[249.90s -> 253.67s]  caves. That's just fantastic.
[253.67s -> 257.19s]  Alright, no coal
[257.19s -> 259.94s]  yet.
[259.94s -> 262.38s]  There's coal right there. Found it.
[262.38s -> 264.38s]  I got a bunch of butt heads to deal with.
[264.38s -> 268.15s]  I feel
[268.15s -> 271.22s]  like I'm playing the drums.
[271.22s -> 273.22s]  There it is.
[273.22s -> 276.10s]  There's the coal.
[276.10s -> 278.54s]  That's what I'm looking for.
[278.54s -> 280.78s]  Will you die already?
[280.78s -> 283.14s]  Give me a break.
[283.14s -> 287.82s]  Alright, here it is.
[287.82s -> 289.82s]  Just need one piece of freaking coal.
[289.82s -> 292.25s]  For the love
[292.25s -> 294.25s]  of all that is sacred
[294.25s -> 296.25s]  on planet Earth. Just give me the coal.
[296.25s -> 299.45s]  Oh my god.
[299.45s -> 302.58s]  Finally.
[302.58s -> 304.58s]  Alright, get me the hell back up
[304.58s -> 306.58s]  so I can start to actually play this game.
[306.58s -> 309.27s]  I'm just
[309.27s -> 311.27s]  using my walls.
[311.27s -> 314.98s]  Oh yeah, that's fine. I'm just going to tear down
[314.98s -> 316.98s]  my own walls to get wood.
[316.98s -> 322.15s]  And it's this, right? Yeah.
[322.15s -> 324.15s]  Success. Okay, great.
[324.15s -> 329.38s]  So now, let's
[329.38s -> 332.65s]  do this. Let's make a little
[332.65s -> 334.65s]  small house so I don't get
[334.65s -> 337.08s]  mutilated when it becomes night time.
[337.08s -> 341.62s]  That's good enough.
[341.62s -> 344.50s]  I just need a bed.
[344.50s -> 346.50s]  It needs to be higher than that.
[346.50s -> 348.50s]  Oh god, it needs to be at least one
[348.50s -> 352.41s]  block higher than that. This is temporary.
[352.41s -> 354.41s]  This is temporary. I promise this is temporary.
[354.41s -> 357.08s]  A piece of sand.
[357.08s -> 359.08s]  Look at this mess.
[359.08s -> 361.96s]  This is the worst house
[361.96s -> 363.96s]  I've ever seen in Minecraft.
[363.96s -> 367.35s]  Ever.
[367.35s -> 369.53s]  Alright. At least I have some
[369.53s -> 372.22s]  light in my own house.
[372.22s -> 377.59s]  Gotta pay the electric bill. Well there's more coal
[377.59s -> 380.09s]  over here. That's definitely a start.
[380.09s -> 382.84s]  That's definitely a good thing.
[382.84s -> 386.02s]  Pick that up. Definitely.
[386.02s -> 389.35s]  I came over here for those,
[389.35s -> 392.42s]  that tree right there. But I need
[392.42s -> 395.37s]  this coal too. The fun part about Minecraft
[395.37s -> 397.37s]  is you can kind of just get distracted
[397.37s -> 399.37s]  and just go do whatever you feel like
[399.37s -> 403.14s]  however long you're doing it.
[403.14s -> 405.14s]  That's good. There's a little more over here I saw.
[405.14s -> 407.70s]  Get out of the way. Where was it?
[407.70s -> 410.33s]  Where was it? Where was it?
[410.33s -> 413.98s]  No, that's a shovel.
[413.98s -> 417.35s]  Thought I saw more. Oh well.
[417.35s -> 420.74s]  I came over here for this single
[420.74s -> 425.22s]  out of place tree. Let there be light.
[425.22s -> 430.65s]  Aim up.
[430.65s -> 432.65s]  Always cut down the whole tree or else it won't
[432.65s -> 435.66s]  disappear. That's what grandpa
[435.66s -> 439.30s]  told me. Cause he raged one,
[439.30s -> 442.95s]  he raged one time. The whole tree
[442.95s -> 444.95s]  you gotta cut down the whole god damn
[444.95s -> 448.66s]  tree Jeremy. And I said why?
[448.66s -> 451.22s]  Why would I want to do that?
[451.22s -> 453.22s]  Because it's against the law if you don't.
[453.22s -> 456.74s]  Yeah it's against the law.
[456.74s -> 459.67s]  I don't think so grandpa.
[459.67s -> 462.81s]  I think you're just nuts.
[462.81s -> 467.54s]  Starting to get dark. This is a big damn
[467.54s -> 469.54s]  this is a big tree. This has so much wood in it.
[469.54s -> 472.55s]  It's got a lot of wood in this tree.
[472.55s -> 476.58s]  That's actually a good thing cause I don't want to come back
[476.58s -> 481.83s]  and do it again. Hello, excuse me.
[481.83s -> 486.44s]  No I hate when this happens.
[486.44s -> 488.81s]  Now I gotta like, ugh. Let me get all
[488.81s -> 491.18s]  up in this tree. Can I put a
[491.18s -> 493.18s]  no I can't put a torch down right there.
[493.18s -> 496.63s]  There's so much wood in this tree.
[496.63s -> 498.63s]  It's unbelievable how much wood is in this tree.
[498.63s -> 500.63s]  Is that it? Oh my god.
[500.63s -> 504.54s]  There's more wood in this tree.
[504.54s -> 506.54s]  This is insane.
[506.54s -> 509.86s]  This entire tree is just a big huge
[509.86s -> 512.10s]  block of wood. Usually there's only
[512.10s -> 514.54s]  a few. I'm confused.
[514.54s -> 520.86s]  Oh my god.
[520.86s -> 522.86s]  Whatever. Here's the last one right here.
[522.86s -> 525.61s]  I'm outta here.
[525.61s -> 527.61s]  Give me the torch. I'm going back
[527.61s -> 530.74s]  home. Look at that beautiful
[530.74s -> 533.24s]  moon. So elegant.
[533.24s -> 537.53s]  Okay so I got that wood. Let's do
[537.53s -> 540.92s]  something with it. Let's make it into a bunch
[540.92s -> 544.87s]  of things.
[544.87s -> 547.30s]  Just shift click. Alright let's make
[547.30s -> 549.30s]  this into a ton of sticks.
[549.30s -> 553.26s]  Shift click and where's
[553.26s -> 556.26s]  my crafting bench? It's down there.
[556.26s -> 558.63s]  Alright let's at least cover this
[558.63s -> 560.63s]  hole up so I can not get murdered if
[560.63s -> 564.09s]  somebody comes and gets me. I have my house
[564.09s -> 566.09s]  made out of like three different materials
[566.09s -> 569.74s]  right now. I'll tell you it
[569.74s -> 571.91s]  will make progress. If you
[571.91s -> 573.91s]  are watching this video for the first time
[573.91s -> 575.91s]  and there's like 15 episodes ahead
[575.91s -> 577.91s]  of this, I promise this is not
[577.91s -> 579.91s]  gonna be this much of a mess through the
[579.91s -> 581.91s]  whole series. Promise.
[581.91s -> 585.29s]  And if it is, then
[585.29s -> 588.62s]  whoops.
[588.62s -> 590.86s]  This would be my nice little cave house
[590.86s -> 595.08s]  for the time being. This is it
[595.08s -> 598.09s]  right here. Where is my...
[598.09s -> 601.03s]  There we go. Let's just close it up.
[601.03s -> 603.72s]  No sense in just
[603.72s -> 607.50s]  sitting here like this. Here we
[607.50s -> 609.86s]  go. My house is pretty much
[609.86s -> 612.87s]  complete. At least my
[612.87s -> 616.58s]  caveman house is. Let's get in there.
[616.58s -> 619.02s]  Oh my god. Where's my
[619.02s -> 621.19s]  certificate? Where's my certificate for
[621.19s -> 623.69s]  first house built? Cause it just happened.
[623.69s -> 626.63s]  Make it... Oh my god! No!
[626.63s -> 628.63s]  No! No!
[628.63s -> 631.13s]  No!
[631.13s -> 633.30s]  That could have been bad. Imagine if I just
[633.30s -> 635.30s]  drowned myself. That would be terrible.
