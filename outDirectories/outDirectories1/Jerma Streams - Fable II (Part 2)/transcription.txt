[7.03s -> 13.93s]  Hey, what's up everybody? Hey, what's up everybody?
[15.37s -> 44.10s]  What's up guys? Hey, what's going on? Hey, what's going on guys?
[49.48s -> 62.07s]  Oh, oh my god. Oh my god. Hi guys. How you doing? I'm not late. I'm here. I'm fine.
[62.63s -> 69.53s]  He's practicing. Yeah, he's practicing. I had to get the intro right. I had to get it right,
[69.53s -> 84.89s]  but the mic was hot. Anyways, hello. How you doing? But he lied about Megamind.
[85.69s -> 93.03s]  No, I did not lie about Megamind. It was a great movie. Uh, okay. Yeah, I'm going to give you a
[93.03s -> 104.62s]  synopsis. Fine. It's a blue, uh, evil guy who's an orphan sent to earth. Part of this other guy,
[104.62s -> 109.34s]  Metro Man. What do you mean? What do you mean? Tell us. Tell us. That's what I'm telling you.
[111.93s -> 122.22s]  That there was, he makes hell. Space Dad, isn't it? I, it was, it was okay. I like the big ending
[122.22s -> 134.46s]  parade that they did. Dude, the spoilers. What I did like the most about the movie was when he
[134.46s -> 140.25s]  turned himself into the police. He turned himself in and imprisoned himself. Just like Rick from
[140.25s -> 147.78s]  Rick and Morty did in that episode in season two. They put on a nice disguise. That's a holographic
[147.78s -> 158.31s]  disguise. And then Hal actually at the end, you know, the fucking evil computer. It was a fine
[158.31s -> 173.40s]  movie. I give it like a B plus. Okay. There was no evil computer. What are you talking about?
[174.73s -> 182.28s]  Hal from, it's an evil computer. He lied. There is no evil computer. What? Yes, there is.
[189.34s -> 197.78s]  That's Space Odyssey. It was a fun movie. It was a fun movie. I like the, at the end when everybody's
[197.78s -> 204.14s]  dancing and the guy's in there and he's got like the orange suit on and he's dancing. Look,
[204.14s -> 220.07s]  it doesn't matter if you think I watched it or not. I've seen it. I did see it. Anyways,
[220.07s -> 223.35s]  it doesn't matter. Hey, welcome. We're going to play Fable II again. Hope everyone's having a good
[224.15s -> 281.85s]  day. I'm ready to play. I'm ready to go. I have to tweet this though. I'll be right back. To the,
[281.85s -> 285.37s]  to the guy that said, I have really boring tweets. You're really not going to like this one.
[286.90s -> 295.72s]  It's so boring. That was really boring. I just said more Fable II and that's it. I didn't say
[295.72s -> 301.74s]  anything else. Use the GIF. I don't even have the GIF on my computer or my phone or anything.
[302.38s -> 307.70s]  Why are you giving 50 community subs? You don't even know if the stream is going to be any good
[307.70s -> 315.66s]  or not. That's so much money to give. That's too much money to give. What if the stream sucks?
[319.24s -> 323.08s]  That's so much money. Thank you. Zap X. Thanks to 50 community subs.
[329.94s -> 332.58s]  Nah, thanks though. I appreciate that. That's too much money.
[333.46s -> 339.88s]  Way too much money to give one single human. Remember, you act humble so you can get more
[339.88s -> 356.49s]  money. It's a conspiracy. It's all just an act. You know, it's like really, all right,
[356.49s -> 362.89s]  this is real. I'm going to do a real talk with you guys here. Yeah, like it doesn't matter how
[363.45s -> 366.89s]  much like somebody says like, oh, you know, like, thanks. I don't like, don't need it. Don't want
[366.89s -> 370.57s]  it though. Like, like you never know who's just fucking with you. You know what I mean? You just
[370.57s -> 375.67s]  never know who's like, just lying to you. I get it. I get it. I could sit here and be like,
[375.67s -> 379.11s]  oh man, don't, no, don't do that. Don't do that, man. But like, oh, thank you. Thank you. Give me
[379.11s -> 382.87s]  more. Like there are people that are like that. It's like, how could you ever trust anybody?
[383.96s -> 390.49s]  I get it. No, I completely get you. Don't worry. Well, thanks though. Appreciate it. Thank you.
[391.29s -> 399.53s]  Oh, so true. Oh, so true. Yeah. He's farming like the so trues now. That's the next conspiracy.
[400.25s -> 410.01s]  Be honest for this. Even if I am honest, it doesn't matter. Okay. Let's go play a fable too.
[410.01s -> 419.40s]  It's fun. I have a confession to give you guys though. I may, I may have blacksmithed
[420.20s -> 425.48s]  like 20 minutes before the stream started. I wanted to get it out of the way because I didn't
[425.48s -> 429.96s]  want to just blacksmith for like the first 20 minutes of the stream. I just sat there in silence
[430.76s -> 438.01s]  getting like an extra 10 grand. Okay. We're of course going to do that again, but I at least
[438.01s -> 445.45s]  removed one 20 minute portion of the stream where is it going to be blacksmithing. And I also noticed
[446.09s -> 452.73s]  the weapons dealer here, the blacksmith here has a 50% off sale right now. It's a bargain at that
[452.73s -> 457.37s]  price. So I don't know why I just thought he was going to say it's a me Mario. I don't know why
[457.37s -> 465.00s]  every time it's a me. I don't know why that's what I thought he was going to say that items on sale.
[465.80s -> 474.36s]  Okay. So everything's 50% off. So I'm going to buy everything. Look at this 20. This is a $4,000
[474.36s -> 486.33s]  sword. I'm going to get it for half off. Look at steel flintlock rifle, 2,400 bucks. I'll take it.
[489.61s -> 494.25s]  What are you going to do with the sword? With half a sword? What are you talking about?
[495.59s -> 504.60s]  Oh, I get it. That's funny. Okay. And then what else do I need? Yeah. I got a gun. Okay. Now what
[504.60s -> 515.61s]  about who, anybody, you sell clothes here? Iron Axe is best. What do you mean best? 37
[515.61s -> 525.83s]  iron. Oh yeah. Sell this. Wait, wait. He's 50% off. I'm selling. Why am I selling this for 50% off?
[525.83s -> 532.10s]  That's not how this, I don't come to this guy and say, oh, by the way, I see the sign. You have a
[532.10s -> 542.15s]  50% off sale. Me too. What? That's not how that works. God damn it. Whatever. I'll just go sell
[542.15s -> 558.71s]  it next door to like the other guy. Yes. Ask questions about my daughter. What, who's this guy?
[559.75s -> 572.44s]  Kiernan the Traveler? Wait, is this my son? Kiernan the Time Traveler? Oh shit. All right. Now I
[572.44s -> 582.57s]  demand it. All right. Fine. I'll start. See? There we go. All right. So now I've got, I want to go to,
[582.57s -> 590.78s]  I want to get some new clothes. Alvin, that's my dog. Okay. I want to go. I want to get some new
[590.78s -> 599.34s]  clothes. Where's the tailor? Who sells clothes here? Do more blacksmithing. No, I'm not going
[599.34s -> 612.02s]  to do more blacksmithing. Oh my God. What is going on here? 50 more community subs. What are you guys
[612.02s -> 631.42s]  doing? From Video Vivi. Thanks for the 50 community subs. Again, another person. Thank you a lot.
[631.42s -> 641.98s]  Thank you a lot. All right. I got a bunch of pies. I have to stay fat. Important. I know for a fact
[641.98s -> 652.20s]  that there's a demon door in this game somewhere. Then we have to find it. Okay. Hi. Here we go.
[652.20s -> 661.05s]  Let's go do, I want the tailor. There's like a potion person. Why doesn't he not say community
[661.05s -> 671.70s]  subs anymore? I got tired. That got tired. What does that mean? I heard there's a sale, but there's
[671.70s -> 677.80s]  not a real bargain or anything. What do you mean there's no bargain? That's a fine item.
[677.80s -> 682.73s]  I'm just going to buy all these, these cheat codes. There you go. Come back anytime.
[682.73s -> 689.70s]  Alvarine strength potion. Oh shit. These are expensive, but I want them. There you go. That's
[689.70s -> 698.52s]  a fine item. Look at this. Uh, I'm going to get a healing potion too. Java potion, healing points.
[698.52s -> 704.70s]  Yep. That's a fine item. It's no longer a community anymore. There you go. There you go.
[705.42s -> 713.35s]  That's a fine item. There you go. All right. Here we go. Face cam pretty please. Nope. No face cam.
[713.35s -> 722.12s]  I don't do face cam. I'm a non face cam streamer. All right. I'm going to do a bunch of this.
[722.12s -> 730.18s]  I wish there was a quick menu. Like I remember the reviews of this game all saying that going
[730.18s -> 737.13s]  like seven sub menus in or like three sub menus in to click on an item was horrible.
[737.13s -> 748.14s]  It's a riot. Why are you writing? I'm not going to try. I don't want face cam on. No,
[748.14s -> 766.33s]  you're not getting it. No face cam because you're naked. How I am clothed in the
[766.97s -> 782.50s]  comfortable privacy of my own house is how I'm going to be. And that's final. I can be as nude
[782.50s -> 789.99s]  or non nude in my home as I want to be. This town is becoming more exclusive by the day.
[794.52s -> 797.56s]  It really is naked. I'm not naked, but that doesn't mean that I could be.
[798.73s -> 806.97s]  So don't be shocked. It couldn't be whatever the right way to say that.
[809.59s -> 815.80s]  All right. Concentrated XP. Now let's make some moves here. Okay. I got a lot of skills. Hello.
[817.10s -> 826.71s]  Oh, that's my wife. You don't romance me like you used to. Shit. Um, need any assistance?
[826.71s -> 834.78s]  Oh man. She's not happy at all. Don't worry. I'll just do a bunch of emotes.
[835.42s -> 855.14s]  That's just wonderful. My good one. Yes. Oh, I can't game it. Come on. Do it.
[862.52s -> 869.37s]  Why am I naked? I'm not naked, but I could choose to be if I choose. So right now I could,
[869.70s -> 887.90s]  understand. All right. We're good.
[891.98s -> 896.63s]  The fecal funny. Stop saying that. It's a, it's an incredibly important
[896.63s -> 909.48s]  emote in the game. Don't you get it? Okay. I'm leaving. Now let me level up.
[909.48s -> 917.43s]  Just be happy that I actually off stream did all this bullshit.
[918.39s -> 928.68s]  Okay. So I can do have about like nine, 10,000 blades. Three is 16,000. I think I'm going to
[928.68s -> 938.50s]  wait for blades three, but I could probably do health, right? What the fuck level,
[940.66s -> 947.85s]  level five shock. Everything else level one. Hmm. How about skilled? Okay. I could do speed
[948.81s -> 954.68s]  or accuracy. Yeah. I want to accurate because the guy, I have a cool gun.
[955.32s -> 970.30s]  What about dexter styles aimed ranged attack? Oh shit. I want to do that. I definitely want
[970.30s -> 978.46s]  to do that. Brutal styles. This is flat. We'll get this flourishes. You've learned the brutal
[978.46s -> 983.42s]  style flourish while holding X, move your L toward an enemy to build up an unblockable flourish and
[983.42s -> 989.34s]  then release X to unleash the flourish. Yeah. Cool. All right. Let's go. I got what I wanted.
[989.34s -> 1004.84s]  Did you watch mega mind? Yes. And I agree with fucking, um, uh, what are the, um,
[1006.58s -> 1015.72s]  robert and I, okay. I agree with Ebert and robert who said that it was two thumbs way up.
[1015.72s -> 1031.77s]  Who were the people that review the movies? Cisco and Ebert. No, but like, but it was Cisco
[1031.77s -> 1045.27s]  and Ebert. Then it was Ebert and robert. Yeah, it was the Ebert and robert. I didn't, I didn't make
[1045.27s -> 1056.01s]  somebody else. What are you talking about? That's a real, what are you talking about? All right.
[1056.01s -> 1071.18s]  Let's go. I'm not, I'm ready to go. Quest. What should I do? Notholes Island, big freeze,
[1071.98s -> 1077.54s]  Donkey Kong country level, the temple of shadow gain entry to the temple. Wait, temple of shadow.
[1077.54s -> 1082.58s]  That sounds evil. The summoners, two idiots have read from the Necronomicon, the book of the
[1082.58s -> 1087.75s]  extremely dead, the gates of the nether world have opened the archeologist make donations at the
[1087.75s -> 1115.54s]  temple of light or go to the sculptor. Let me go to the sculptor. Prove you aren't high and naked.
[1115.54s -> 1119.14s]  When could I ever prove that I'm not high and naked? What are you talking about?
[1119.14s -> 1124.81s]  You want me to have like a face cam on my body and have like a drug test in the same room? What
[1124.81s -> 1131.18s]  are you talking about? Why do I hear the somebody after me? Why is this person after me? What's
[1131.18s -> 1138.30s]  going on? Hey, no, no, not in front of the shit statue. Come on. This is humiliating.
[1140.14s -> 1149.80s]  1600 gold. What you have been charged with murder times three. It's just, okay. Imagine getting
[1149.80s -> 1157.45s]  like a ticket and they write murder X three on it. Uh, and I'm community service or all right,
[1157.45s -> 1162.12s]  I'll pay it here. I take the money and leave me alone.
[1176.38s -> 1181.50s]  Going to like Walt Disney world and like the sculpture of Disney in front of the right and
[1181.50s -> 1185.18s]  like in the garden is him holding his butt screaming while he's shitting his pants.
[1189.38s -> 1195.24s]  Oh, like the magic of Walt Disney world. He's screaming while like he's shitting into his
[1195.24s -> 1222.58s]  hands. Okay. Well, there it is. 12 minutes of blacksmithing to atone for the wave to do another
[1222.58s -> 1228.26s]  one. How many of these do I have to do? Should it just all be me shitting my pants? You wish to
[1228.26s -> 1236.07s]  model for me again. I mean, why would I put these everywhere? What's wrong with me? Mission of statue
[1236.07s -> 1243.93s]  50 gold. That's it. You can become a monument for the whole world to admire. All right. Well,
[1243.93s -> 1254.42s]  let's do it. Literally ancient Rome. Oh, you know what to do. Okay. Begin posing. I can't fart this
[1254.42s -> 1260.74s]  one. Anything you like, but remember to hold it until I tell you to. Can I do it with my ex?
[1261.38s -> 1269.62s]  No, no, no. Come on. Come on. Come on. No, the stupid sub menu. Yes. Your technique is
[1270.90s -> 1275.62s]  please. You must hold your pose until I say so. Not a moment earlier.
[1275.70s -> 1285.59s]  Yeah. All right. Come on. Yes. Your technique is astounding.
[1288.39s -> 1296.44s]  I hope you can sustain this performance. Okay. No, no, no. You stopped too soon.
[1298.81s -> 1309.80s]  How long do I have to do that for? Yes. Your technique is astounding. Hope you can sustain
[1309.80s -> 1319.51s]  this performance. Keep it up. Okay. I have never seen such modeling just a bit longer.
[1324.98s -> 1331.26s]  Okay. That's another like holding my ass, shitting in my hand statue. Never mind. It
[1331.26s -> 1335.34s]  shall have to do. Is it going to be everywhere? Wait for my work any longer. I want the aliens
[1335.34s -> 1345.86s]  to find us eventually. I mean, like in 500 years, I don't want, by the way, I don't want any recorded
[1345.86s -> 1354.42s]  history. The only thing I want is I want like 15 statues of me holding my ass screaming. That's
[1354.42s -> 1358.18s]  the only thing that I want. Like 100 generations in front of us to look back and be like, why did
[1358.18s -> 1369.43s]  they, what was this for? Change pants? No. All right. So that was easy. Let's do, um,
[1370.95s -> 1379.98s]  summoners. Oh, jobs. Uh, let's do, let's do the summoners. These two idiots that, uh,
[1381.30s -> 1389.24s]  or the hero. Now let's do a hero of will. Let's do the hero of will.
[1389.24s -> 1392.04s]  Didn't I say I was going to do this stuff? I was going to keep like progressing the story.
[1401.54s -> 1421.45s]  You erected the same statue in the same town. What? There you are. I believe the second of our
[1421.45s -> 1426.65s]  heroes, the mage is in Brightwood. There is a powerful will user there called Garth.
[1427.91s -> 1434.86s]  Do you remember that name? He was there the night Lucien killed Rose. You didn't tell me that. How
[1434.86s -> 1442.50s]  are we supposed to trust him? Garth believed Lucien's interest in the old kingdom was purely
[1442.50s -> 1448.50s]  academic like his own. And Lucien already on Garth thought Garth was merely a brilliant scholar.
[1449.62s -> 1453.30s]  When each learned the truth about the other, their partnership ended
[1454.10s -> 1463.18s]  violently. You will find Garth in Brightwood. I have seen a vision of him toiling on some ancient
[1463.18s -> 1468.78s]  technology there. All right, let's go. Surely he intends to stop Lucien, but he cannot do so without
[1469.02s -> 1474.89s]  help. You can do a Necronomicon stream. No, that's terrifying.
[1478.87s -> 1486.30s]  I already have enough like problems. Opening and reading from the Necronomicon is like, well,
[1486.30s -> 1504.15s]  um, now I'm going to haunt your fucking house. The hero of will go to Brightwood. Oh, I haven't
[1504.15s -> 1513.90s]  found this location yet. Okay. Well, let's go. My father thought his faith would protect him from
[1513.90s -> 1525.82s]  the world. I won't make the same mistake. Let's go. This fable2.com bullshit.
[1525.82s -> 1540.14s]  Websites didn't even exist back then. Are we having fun, Jeremy dear? Yes. This was 2008, 2009.
[1541.38s -> 1547.70s]  Websites didn't even exist. Websites were created in like 2013 or something.
[1548.50s -> 1565.02s]  Your YouTube channel was in 2011. I was ahead of the curve. You know how NASA had the internet
[1565.02s -> 1586.46s]  before everyone else did? It was me. Ooh, I like that. Ooh, I like this gun. What was the first
[1586.46s -> 1597.43s]  website? It was www.hamsterdance.com. Don't. Oh, they're just shooting at each other.
[1602.47s -> 1606.78s]  Are these guys bad? Who's a bad, are these bad guys?
[1610.46s -> 1620.02s]  Do I help? I'm helping. Don't accidentally. Why am I, why is the guard mad at me for this?
[1620.02s -> 1634.55s]  Oh, that was cool. Why are they mad about this? This is pissing them off. I'm helping you guys.
[1634.55s -> 1648.62s]  What's, I don't understand. Stop right there. They don't like magic. What'd you find? You find
[1648.62s -> 1661.91s]  something? 100 million off the dead. If you sing hamster dance. I don't remember what it was. It's
[1661.91s -> 1669.82s]  no, yeah, I do. So like, what was that?
[1676.78s -> 1681.90s]  Something like that, right? And then it goes, here we go.
[1685.18s -> 1706.07s]  That's the remix, but you know, where's the dig spot? Ooh, clothing trader. Perfect. What do you
[1706.07s -> 1726.71s]  got? Flogs. I kind of want it. Did I ever get a sun vest? Shirt? Striped bandana? No. Play the song.
[1726.71s -> 1736.14s]  No. Well, okay. There it is. All right. Come on. Let's go. Where is it? There you go. Good boy. Good
[1736.14s -> 1758.47s]  boy. Good boy. Oh, the secret castle of Fairville. That's disgusting. Buried condoms? Why wouldn't I,
[1758.47s -> 1765.66s]  I would, who would pick a condom up off the ground? That is the most universal
[1766.78s -> 1780.06s]  wretched thing that anyone could see on the ground. I mean, absolutely wretched universal.
[1781.24s -> 1786.84s]  If you see that, it's like, I want to leave this whole area. I don't want to be where I am right
[1786.84s -> 1800.12s]  now. Just dump like, dump fucking alcohol all over where this is. I don't want to even be near here.
[1800.12s -> 1808.31s]  Your dog is now a two-star treasure hunter. Oh, nice. Oops. Sorry I dropped that.
[1811.77s -> 1827.40s]  That was only 150 bucks. Where's the big money? You can upgrade the dog. Oh, yeah. Dog is very
[1827.40s -> 1856.41s]  upgradable. Has he done the Armin impression yet? Not yet. Someone or something is coming my way.
[1857.21s -> 1863.08s]  I have never felt anything like it. I would say that's a fucking victory royale coming my way.
[1863.80s -> 1897.30s]  Oh, I can't make a reference to my, my like epic games name. Why not? Oh shit. Balvarine.
[1897.94s -> 1928.23s]  Shit, what the hell just happened? And, oh, there's a huge bonus coming up here.
[1928.87s -> 1940.22s]  What kind of bonus was that? 150%. I probably should, no, let's go towards the actual mission,
[1940.22s -> 1954.30s]  please. The way. There we go. You think you're good at this game? I don't think you can be good
[1954.30s -> 1958.95s]  at this game. The fighting and the combat in this game is sort of just there for you to get to the
[1958.95s -> 1965.90s]  next part where you fart in front of a crowd of people. It's fun to play. It's not, it's fun.
[1965.98s -> 1994.04s]  How's this? You found an empty statue. Oh shit. Perfect. What's going on? How's it doing this?
[1994.04s -> 1998.20s]  Oh my God. I didn't even see them. What? What happened? I couldn't even tell they were there.
[1999.62s -> 2021.19s]  That was really weird. Don't let him go. He tripped over his own feet. I need 10,000. I need 14,000
[2021.19s -> 2047.54s]  to get to blades three. His friend just got down. Oh, I see what you mean. All right, dig. Where is
[2047.54s -> 2069.16s]  it? You got it? You can do it. Come on. He's finding it. Yeah, there we go. More condoms.
[2069.16s -> 2084.87s]  How come the sus guy is not doing the voice today? What voice? Doesn't the sus guy not have a voice?
[2085.43s -> 2106.28s]  It's just, it's just the face, right? It's the boss. Oh, Balvarines. I just want to see a
[2106.28s -> 2110.89s]  Balvarine so I can just stop saying Balvarine. Oh shit. This is the real deal.
[2119.08s -> 2135.82s]  Save Garth. On it. Ow. Watch it. See, imagine if the game was like Dark Souls and it was played
[2135.82s -> 2141.34s]  like this. It was fable Dark Souls. Microsoft, just make another one. Everybody's copying
[2141.34s -> 2146.15s]  fucking From Software. Like nobody, it doesn't matter anymore. From Software just took the
[2146.15s -> 2150.15s]  model and made it like really cool and interesting. Just copy it. Like everybody's doing it. Every
[2150.15s -> 2154.07s]  single game company now is like making their own like Dark Souls system. Just put it in. Just do
[2154.07s -> 2167.98s]  it. Just make fable four and make it a Dark Souls game. They're literally making a new fable. Yeah,
[2167.98s -> 2181.54s]  but it has to be a Dark Souls copy. Otherwise, I won't be happy with it. Maybe Elden Ring will
[2181.54s -> 2197.70s]  be like that. Maybe. It's the racing game people that are making the new one. What do you mean
[2197.70s -> 2229.48s]  the racing game? Big finish. It's the Forza devs. I mean, look, they might do a really good job. I
[2229.48s -> 2233.96s]  can't. I'm not going to be one of those people that goes, well, they're a racing game dev. They'll
[2233.96s -> 2239.27s]  never do a fun video game ever. That's not a car game. I'm not going to say that because I don't
[2239.27s -> 2252.57s]  know. For all we know that the lead designer of Forza has been waiting to make like a fable
[2252.57s -> 2260.17s]  game his entire life. You want me to like pass judgment on something that doesn't exist yet?
[2260.17s -> 2285.74s]  Somebody leaked the Elden Ring investor trailer. Wait, what? Investor trailer? That doesn't make
[2285.74s -> 2296.04s]  any sense. From Software is not a publicly traded company. What do you mean investing trailer?
[2297.00s -> 2327.53s]  Private investor? Literally true. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. Holy shit. Eat. What am I doing?
[2328.33s -> 2340.36s]  Oh, wow. I didn't want to do that. Where's my, um, how did this change?
[2348.90s -> 2383.91s]  Oh, that was cool. That was really cool. This game's fun. Oh, and flourish. That was fun.
[2384.47s -> 2393.58s]  Okay. How are we doing? Is this worth playing? Yeah, I think, I think so.
[2394.22s -> 2413.46s]  I would say fable is a, is an experience worth playing. How was that? I'm coming Garth.
[2425.18s -> 2429.98s]  You left too soon Garth. Lord Lucian's experiment was a radical success.
[2435.50s -> 2450.41s]  You are coming with me. They got him. There was nothing you could do.
[2451.13s -> 2455.62s]  That was Lucian's commandant and apparently he now controls a shard,
[2456.42s -> 2462.58s]  an old kingdom weapon of great power. Lucian's strength grows ever more formidable as does his
[2462.58s -> 2467.86s]  mastery of the spire and its awful machinery. Come back to the guild. Okay. But first let me
[2467.86s -> 2481.40s]  check and see if there's any, uh, valuable shot. You can, you guys tell me like fecal funny. What
[2481.40s -> 2514.57s]  do you mean trespassing? Let's head back to the guild. Fecal funny. Look it up. All right. Where
[2514.57s -> 2518.17s]  is he? Sounds like you could have used my help after all. I knew I should have come.
[2519.45s -> 2522.89s]  We cannot allow Lucian to keep Garth. You must get him out of there.
[2524.09s -> 2532.97s]  They're being the spire. Wait, inspire the sound of your own heartbeat. There is one who might know
[2532.97s -> 2539.37s]  when Lucian left for the spire, he essentially abandoned his staff. His old butler Jeeves now
[2539.37s -> 2545.98s]  spends his days at the current corset. His butler? I bet he saw his fair share of dirty dealings.
[2547.24s -> 2551.16s]  Well, if it means a trip to the pub, we'll just have to make that sacrifice. Or not like Minecraft
[2551.16s -> 2554.92s]  and think it's going to be around for a long time. The task requires tact and delicacy.
[2554.92s -> 2572.86s]  Something I believe you're after. No, you literally asked this last week. I'm still,
[2572.86s -> 2584.18s]  I'm just checking. Anyone playing Battleship yet? I have to check in on that every like month or so
[2584.18s -> 2596.01s]  too. No? Not yet? Okay. I'm telling you, just look, just wait for the YouTube thumbnails
[2596.57s -> 2601.45s]  of like the Battleship in the middle and two like popular YouTubers or streamers
[2601.45s -> 2604.97s]  both like freaking out in the thumbnail. Like, oh my God, I can't believe that move.
[2606.02s -> 2638.74s]  It's going to be Battleship. I'm telling you Battleship. Battleship has no strategy. So?
[2638.74s -> 2658.81s]  And yes, it does. How does it not have strategy? Oh, this person has a gift. What do I need to do?
[2658.81s -> 2672.81s]  Oh, almost there. Hold on. Of course it has strategy. Minesweeper has more strategy than
[2672.81s -> 2681.26s]  Battleship. Let me ask you this. Let me ask you this question. Does Mario Party have more
[2681.26s -> 2695.06s]  strategy than Battleship? Yes. 25% discount of the whole. Really? Nice.
[2700.38s -> 2709.34s]  You only have three items. Should I try to do like Jack Sparrow?
[2721.24s -> 2737.85s]  There's so many ways to reduce RNG in Mario Party. Archmage robes. That's what those are.
[2737.85s -> 2782.95s]  Okay, I like this. This looks very odd. Oh, Pauline. It's like I'm a pirate that got
[2782.95s -> 2789.90s]  clothing that was five sizes too small. I was last in line to get my pirate uniform.
[2790.54s -> 2803.53s]  I'm sorry, Dave. All we have are extra smalls. Kill it.
[2810.22s -> 2818.63s]  I feel like this character kind of talks like a baby. He's like the big dumb guy.
[2818.63s -> 2824.39s]  Yeah, I guess I want to go that way, boss. That's what Peter Griffin's based off of,
[2824.39s -> 2830.73s]  that character. That like Looney Tunes character is who Peter Griffin's voice is based off of.
[2830.73s -> 2834.97s]  Listen to it. I think that guy actually says that. I think he's like,
[2835.77s -> 2839.21s]  oh, boy, I don't know what I'm doing. I think that's Peter Griffin.
[2839.21s -> 2856.33s]  It's a Boston accent, genius. I have no idea. I'm not like from that area. I have no idea.
[2856.33s -> 2862.47s]  Never been there before. I spent 30 fucking years in Boston. I don't even know what that is.
[2862.47s -> 2882.76s]  What town, what city is that? I know it's Rhode Island. Yeah, but it's New England.
[2882.76s -> 2886.76s]  It's the Boston accent. It's a New England accent. Just look, I know it's Rhode Island.
[2886.76s -> 2893.69s]  It's Pawtucket, Rhode Island. That's a Boston accent that Peter Griffin has.
[2898.41s -> 2910.07s]  What happened to your Boston accent? What am I doing in here?
[2916.71s -> 2920.73s]  What is everyone doing in here? I'm trying to do a quest.
[2923.43s -> 2924.87s]  The whole town is coming in here.
[2930.58s -> 2934.26s]  And here's something else that's written down. My price.
[2936.26s -> 2945.00s]  I apparently offended that person. I don't even know what I did. 1,000 gold pieces and not a penny less.
[2945.00s -> 2953.67s]  It's my final offer. Take it or leave it. Lucian's diary is a riveting read, I assure you.
[2953.67s -> 2959.03s]  I'm sure some private collector will make a nice place for it in his equally private home.
[2959.03s -> 2961.11s]  Oh, we're shooting this guy in the head? Or what?
[2961.11s -> 2965.03s]  Unless you've got a proposition, I suggest you leave me to my whiskey.
[2989.85s -> 2995.70s]  Honey, please, you don't want to be in here. Get out of here. I'm like, I'm doing something.
[2996.42s -> 3000.70s]  You don't, I don't want you to know what I do for work. You think I put this fucking mask on and
[3000.70s -> 3007.45s]  what do you think I do? Go work at the fucking like grocery store? Get out of here. I'm trying
[3007.45s -> 3027.58s]  to do something. Where were we? I want to like fucking punch him. Do I have to pay him?
[3027.58s -> 3062.18s]  That extra animation. Dog, get him. I think I have to pay him. I don't think I, I think I have to pay him.
[3079.96s -> 3090.95s]  I have to, I have to pay him. Fine, here's a thousand dollars.
[3091.19s -> 3098.58s]  Or not. It's a juicy little collection. I assure you, you won't regret it.
[3102.15s -> 3107.91s]  I buried Lucille's diary. I'm just tuning her out. I want to hear what she's saying.
[3114.49s -> 3120.26s]  I want, I want to hear what she's saying. I don't like, I want to be able to hear it.
[3120.26s -> 3123.64s]  Okay, let's go.
[3145.35s -> 3157.03s]  I have to get out of here. I was thinking, I can't shoot her. I can't, I'm sorry.
[3158.63s -> 3163.85s]  I told you to get out of here. You don't want to see what I'm doing. Can I take that money back?
[3164.86s -> 3169.74s]  You're horrible. I didn't do anything, okay? I shot that guy because he was dick and I didn't
[3169.74s -> 3177.14s]  want to pay him. I didn't ruin everything. I'm fine. I need to put the gun away. You got the money?
[3177.78s -> 3185.59s]  I want to put the gun down. Put the gun down. Put the gun, I, what's the put gun away move?
[3188.84s -> 3194.26s]  Put the gun down. Hide till they can't see me. Oh my god, get out of here.
[3194.26s -> 3219.40s]  What are you doing? Oh shit, right. Did they see me? No, I didn't. Oh my god.
[3231.90s -> 3245.03s]  I played football when I was 12. I know all the jukes. Oh.
[3260.50s -> 3272.81s]  I can't believe my wife left me because I shot a guy.
[3272.81s -> 3276.97s]  Why was she even there? What was the, I need to rent my, wait, there's a baby.
[3276.97s -> 3293.13s]  Where's the baby? What happened? Is the baby still here? Hey, she took the kids.
[3293.13s -> 3308.09s]  Oh, well, I didn't want her to see that. All right, anyways, what's the next mission?
[3308.09s -> 3315.90s]  I have horns growing out of my head. No, I don't. Oh shit, I have, okay. I have like sprouts. Uh oh.
[3315.90s -> 3327.50s]  Okay, we gotta do some, go donate to the church. I'm gonna go donate to the church right now.
[3327.50s -> 3338.68s]  I've got a bunch of money. I'm gonna go to donate to the church. Donating to the light. Okay.
[3361.32s -> 3365.64s]  It was you, the guy hiding with the gun in his hands. If I just didn't, I,
[3365.64s -> 3395.30s]  what's the holster button? A. It is A. God damn it. Okay, I'm here to donate money to the church.
[3395.62s -> 3401.98s]  Please contribute to our temple and receive the blessing of the light.
[3401.98s -> 3406.44s]  I will. Each donation will bring you wisdom and peace of mind.
[3407.85s -> 3413.72s]  Anybody got a sander? Can I just lean down? I just need to borrow a sander for a little bit.
[3413.72s -> 3426.17s]  I gotta sand something off my head. Okay, how much do I need to give to be a good person?
[3426.17s -> 3434.23s]  Do I, you? What? What? Donate when the light is brightest to receive greater wisdom.
[3434.79s -> 3442.78s]  Do they know I'm a murderer? How? How do I donate? To turn safety on?
[3449.02s -> 3452.79s]  How do I donate? Wait, the loot?
[3458.41s -> 3474.36s]  Is this a donation? Okay, I can't donate to the church. Why? Stand in the light and donate.
[3474.44s -> 3482.86s]  What's going on? Looking for your next victim, murderer?
[3482.86s -> 3489.10s]  Yeah, you, if you say that again. Why would you walk up to a murderer and say,
[3489.10s -> 3492.78s]  oh, what, you're looking to murder some more people, murderer? You're gonna murder me?
[3493.93s -> 3496.41s]  Don't do that to a fucking murderer. A guy that's like,
[3496.41s -> 3499.94s]  we'll just kill people for no reason. What are you doing?
[3499.94s -> 3504.42s]  Oh, look, it's the murderer. Oh, yes, sir. But that's the guy with the gun.
[3504.42s -> 3511.72s]  Perhaps your generosity will make- I think this is bugged.
[3512.44s -> 3531.00s]  Go to the bowl? Oh, how much should I give? How much money does it take for me to bring my
[3531.00s -> 3543.64s]  five grand? Ten thousand? I'm not gonna give all of it. I want to have some money.
[3543.64s -> 3569.96s]  You want to be good, give 10k. Now I have to go backwards. I went a little too far.
[3569.96s -> 3573.70s]  This is just like when I'm at the fucking gas station and I want to do an exact even number
[3573.70s -> 3582.70s]  and it ends up like that. And it's like, fuck! Give six, six, six.
[3588.10s -> 3592.98s]  Oh, your heart is fit to burst in with generosity, I see. 75 good points.
[3592.98s -> 3596.90s]  I believe you have earned the honor of becoming the next harvest benefactor.
[3598.28s -> 3603.24s]  Make a large enough donation during the holy hour and you will receive the harvest reward.
[3603.24s -> 3604.20s]  When's the holy hour?
[3605.08s -> 3606.76s]  And you will know it is right.
[3606.76s -> 3613.88s]  Make a large donation when the mystical sun reaches its zenith. What does that mean?
[3614.44s -> 3626.34s]  Between 12 and 1? How do I know what time it is?
[3628.15s -> 3630.07s]  Oh, okay, so between 12 and 1.
[3630.79s -> 3632.23s]  All right, I need, I need more money.
[3632.23s -> 3635.27s]  All right, let's go make money. I'm gonna be a blacksmith for a little bit. Sorry.
[3635.83s -> 3643.80s]  I know this is supposed to be me actually doing quests, but it's too bad. I killed a guy.
[3643.80s -> 3657.37s]  Bartender? Oh shit, I want to do this. I need to donate 10k.
[3657.37s -> 3673.42s]  Okay. All right, I want to go do the bartending.
[3679.59s -> 3682.68s]  All right, bartender. How does this work?
[3686.09s -> 3688.89s]  Serve. It just has to be green?
[3689.85s -> 3698.39s]  All right, this is easy. Old multiplier.
[3708.58s -> 3712.36s]  Don't you feel like if anyone ever did that,
[3712.36s -> 3715.08s]  this shit would just fucking fall over halfway and get everywhere?
[3715.64s -> 3718.63s]  That stuff doesn't, you can't really do this, can you?
[3720.78s -> 3724.54s]  I feel like that would fall over halfway and hit like the four or five people at the bar
[3724.54s -> 3728.81s]  and go all over. Can you actually do this?
[3738.73s -> 3743.21s]  My stomach just hangs over it. I'm balancing it on my stomach.
[3743.21s -> 3751.02s]  How much more do I have to do? 9 bucks?
[3751.98s -> 3754.94s]  This sucks. Why would I do this? I would just go be a blacksmith.
[3754.94s -> 3765.34s]  I can make $10,000 in five minutes. Bar has to be waxed. Oh, that makes sense.
[3765.34s -> 3775.64s]  That's a wonderfully poured pint with a game of keystone. Perfect.
[3775.64s -> 3780.18s]  Because you're level one. Okay, but I mean, 12 bucks?
[3780.18s -> 3784.50s]  Level five would be what? Like 50? 100? Should I level this up?
[3784.50s -> 3792.06s]  That's a perfect head on that one. Bartender makes money faster.
[3792.06s -> 3797.50s]  Delicious looking pint. Okay.
[3798.14s -> 3812.57s]  Level two bartender. You're comparing an entry level barkeep to a master blacksmith.
[3812.57s -> 3816.71s]  I know, but is it going to be worth it in the end?
[3823.62s -> 3827.61s]  Gambling will pay the most. Do they have like a version of Blackjack or something?
[3835.05s -> 3837.38s]  They do. Where is it?
[3841.80s -> 3844.92s]  Keystone? I don't like roulette. Roulette? I don't know.
[3855.82s -> 3857.42s]  Oh, me? Yeah.
[3857.42s -> 3860.70s]  Yeah. But here's the best part.
[3860.70s -> 3865.38s]  Nobody knows who I am because I have a mask on. Never taking it off.
[3868.07s -> 3871.59s]  Oh yeah, I did kill your friend. I never know who I am.
[3871.59s -> 3889.85s]  Well, you're the fattest guy in town. I think the blacksmith is a very large man.
[3891.80s -> 3904.50s]  Yeah, I don't think so. Holy shit. No, that was perfect.
[3904.50s -> 3911.19s]  What? It's perfect. That was perfect. Do you see how perfect that was?
[3911.19s -> 3914.70s]  It was all the way at the end. Perfect. What the hell?
[3914.70s -> 3930.31s]  A wasted beer. Oh, man. Is there anything more tragic than a wasted beer?
[3931.03s -> 3935.43s]  Oh, man. Dropping it. Oh, fuck, dude. Wasted beer. Waterfowl.
[3935.99s -> 3946.46s]  Nothing worse than a wasted beer. Your cousin from Boston.
[3963.83s -> 3971.42s]  Play pub games? Hey, look, I paid, okay? They came to me. They said,
[3972.22s -> 3985.19s]  you can either go to jail or pay a fine. I paid the fine. And lady, don't want to be like a little...
[3985.19s -> 3990.15s]  I don't want to have to tell you this, but I've got $10,000 in my pocket right now.
[3990.15s -> 4001.32s]  It was $1,600 for murder. That means I can kill eight people in this room right now. Watch it.
[4002.60s -> 4011.34s]  Everyone that wants to come up to me and be like, oh, you fucking bastard,
[4011.34s -> 4015.78s]  I would take you back and I'd shoot you. Oh, would you? Okay. Do you have $1,600?
[4016.58s -> 4023.64s]  Because if you do, then just pull the trigger because that's what it costs to murder in Albion.
[4036.94s -> 4046.70s]  That's the cost of killing somebody. You forgot about the $10,000 you spent
[4046.70s -> 4056.63s]  on the church for forgiveness. Well, I didn't have to do that.
[4056.63s -> 4063.19s]  Wait, the cost is $500. It was $1,600 because you killed three people. Wait, was it? Oh, shit. Okay.
[4063.75s -> 4073.59s]  So let me rephrase that. It's $500. Now, okay, you do the math. It's 27 coin for one of these beers.
[4076.47s -> 4085.48s]  So in the amount of time it takes for you to drink 15 of these beers, you could have already
[4085.48s -> 4098.87s]  killed me and gotten away with it. Let that sink in everybody here. 18 beers per murder.
[4115.26s -> 4118.44s]  This job sucks. Go gamble. Actually, this is pretty good actually.
[4120.28s -> 4124.92s]  I can see how this would be in. This would be like a hundred bucks. Yeah, I'm getting this low five.
[4125.64s -> 4141.26s]  Nice point. Your character looks like my drunk uncle cosplaying as Raphael from the Ninja Turtles.
[4150.39s -> 4159.40s]  6,500 gold till promotion. How long is this going to take? 108? Oh, this is going to take forever.
[4162.22s -> 4168.42s]  This is going to take forever. The gold multiplier is only five.
[4170.58s -> 4174.86s]  Wonderfully poured pint. That's it? Okay, no.
[4180.15s -> 4188.81s]  I'm watching someone else press A every two seconds repeatedly. What am I doing with my life?
[4190.41s -> 4200.70s]  Um, we're just hanging out. Man, we're just hanging out here. The right amount of foam is no foam.
[4201.26s -> 4209.78s]  Can we talk about foam for a sec? Look at the head on that. I've won it. You know, like in
[4209.78s -> 4214.68s]  cartoons and TV shows and movies and literally this video game you're looking at right now,
[4214.68s -> 4219.16s]  the big tankard with the root beer or the beer that has like the big like whipped cream kind
[4219.16s -> 4229.77s]  of foam all over it. I wish that existed. Like I want a huge like goofy whipped cream big foam
[4229.77s -> 4243.21s]  on top of my drinks like that and nobody ever you can never get it. It does Guinness. Yeah,
[4243.21s -> 4261.67s]  but Guinness is gross. Guinness is liquid bread. It's disgusting. I'm sorry. I know everyone who
[4261.67s -> 4266.94s]  loves Guinness. Yes. Oh, Guinness. You gotta get Guinness. Guinness. Oh yeah. When I take a sip
[4266.94s -> 4282.33s]  of Guinness, I feel like I feel like I have to chew Guinness. It's too much. Guinness to me,
[4282.33s -> 4287.21s]  it kind of has like the same look and feel and taste as the thing you tar your driveway with.
[4297.53s -> 4303.54s]  I don't drink beer. I'm not a beer drinker. Okay. Everyone's like, I'm seeing it right now. Oh,
[4303.54s -> 4308.10s]  he's like, he likes the American stuff. Oh, Bud Light. No, Bud Light is gross too.
[4313.54s -> 4320.71s]  To me, Bud Light is the opposite side of the spectrum where you have like those food coloring
[4321.27s -> 4326.30s]  little droplets that you fill up like a bunch of soda water and you have like a beer-flavored
[4326.30s -> 4341.51s]  food coloring dropper and you like and stir it in. I just, I don't like beer. I really just don't.
[4346.07s -> 4349.91s]  Somebody said Blue Moon. Blue Moon is actually okay. I actually don't hate Blue Moon,
[4349.91s -> 4366.54s]  but Blue Moon is the hangover beer, isn't it? Bud Light's the only beer I've ever finished.
[4366.54s -> 4371.62s]  I've never finished though. Yeah, because when you get to the end of a Bud Light,
[4371.62s -> 4376.78s]  it's kind of like, it's kind of gross. It kind of, it feels like, all right, I'm going to be
[4376.78s -> 4379.74s]  kind of, people are going to be grossed out by this, but I have to say it. I'm going to say it.
[4379.74s -> 4383.18s]  So just, I'm going to say something gross. Every time I've ever gotten to the bottom of a beer,
[4383.82s -> 4388.65s]  like the last three or four sips of a beer, I'm talking maybe like an inch at the bottom of the
[4388.65s -> 4394.47s]  glass or the bottle. To me, it's as if somebody swished it around in their mouth and spit it back
[4394.47s -> 4413.22s]  into the glass. I can, I can never finish a beer. I just can't do it. You know what beer that I
[4413.22s -> 4420.22s]  actually kind of really liked? It was this beer, and I know I'm, look, everyone's going to laugh
[4420.22s -> 4426.62s]  because it's like the name of the beer. It was this microbrewery. What the hell was it called?
[4426.62s -> 4433.51s]  Circus Boy. It was a Magic Hat, right? That was cool. It was like this unfiltered Heffenweizen.
[4434.23s -> 4442.04s]  I remember I tried it one time and I was like, this is actually kind of cool. This is kind of
[4442.04s -> 4451.96s]  good. It was called Circus Boy. Yes, Heffenweizen. Am I saying that right? Heffenweizen? Heffenweiser.
[4451.96s -> 4465.05s]  Okay. What does that mean? I like Heffenweisens. Someone explain to me what I like. You drink IPAs?
[4465.05s -> 4476.30s]  No. Heffenweisen is God tier. But what is it though? So when I order a beer, what do I know
[4476.30s -> 4481.46s]  that I like? I don't like the liquid bread. I don't like the food coloring flavoring. It's a Belgian
[4481.46s -> 4493.75s]  beer. So I need to order Belgian beers to wheat beer. Okay. Yeast and wheat. Okay. Your cousin
[4493.75s -> 4509.61s]  from Boston. Well, that's what I like. That's the beer that I like. This actually is making a shit
[4509.61s -> 4522.36s]  load of money. Blue Moon is a wheat beer. Oh, okay. That's why I like it. The really common German
[4522.36s -> 4532.10s]  Bavarian beer. All right. Well, that's what I like. Right, Corona? I actually don't, I'm not a big
[4532.10s -> 4547.98s]  Corona. I don't like Corona. It's okay. What? No. Fuck that. I did it. Dip shit American. It's not
[4547.98s -> 4566.68s]  pronounced that way. Okay. Sorry. You're now at two beers per murder. I'm a wine drinker. You all
[4566.68s -> 4579.61s]  know that. I like wine. I like whiskey. I like vodka. But there's an asterisk on vodka because
[4579.61s -> 4586.17s]  there's a lot of disgusting, just gross cheap vodka that is smells and tastes like nail polish.
[4586.17s -> 4597.02s]  It's nail polish remover. I get a good vodka is good. But there's a certain level where it's
[4597.02s -> 4603.83s]  undrinkable, in my opinion, even when you mix it. I remember I had a screwdriver one time with like
[4603.83s -> 4608.87s]  gross cheap vodka. And it ruined orange juice for about 10 years for me. I couldn't drink orange
[4608.87s -> 4617.27s]  juice anymore. It just it was such a disgusting fucking rancid beverage. It was it was disgusting.
[4617.27s -> 4629.91s]  I could not drink orange juice for like 10 straight years. Do I like flavored vodka? No,
[4629.91s -> 4635.72s]  not really. I just like a nice like decent quality vodka doesn't have to be like super high quality
[4635.72s -> 4648.94s]  but good enough. So it's not going to ruin the drink of vodka is the same Jeremy.
[4651.82s -> 4659.99s]  It's not whiskey is the grossest thing in the world. Well, look, that's it. I have had
[4659.99s -> 4663.83s]  whiskies before that somebody's like, Oh, man, you should try this on and it's got it's got this
[4663.99s -> 4668.39s]  it's got a really smoky flavor. You're gonna love it. It's very smoky and it's got hints of
[4668.39s -> 4673.45s]  almond and I take I take a little sip and it tastes as if somebody asked a cigar in my mouth.
[4675.22s -> 4680.74s]  No exaggeration. Someone asked a cigarette into my mouth. It's fucking disgusting.
[4684.10s -> 4690.09s]  But there's other whiskies that are fine that they taste good. They're smooth. They have like a nice
[4690.09s -> 4702.36s]  flavor profile to them. That's me with bourbon. That's why it's good. Palate of a 16 year old.
[4703.51s -> 4709.27s]  Ashing a cigar in my mouth is not how is that a 16? I didn't say I like ordering mac and cheese
[4709.27s -> 4715.27s]  and chicken fingers off the kids menu. I don't like really smoky like cigar fucking whiskies.
[4723.93s -> 4731.59s]  I actually don't like rum. I'm actually not a big spiced rum fan either. Spiced rum to me tastes
[4731.59s -> 4737.74s]  like they're hiding something. I feel like it's been flavored and spiced to a point where you
[4737.74s -> 4743.93s]  don't like you don't taste what it really tastes like, which is bad. I feel like it's like hiding
[4743.93s -> 4752.81s]  something gross. I don't know why. That's what I feel like. I have $25,000. What happened? What?
[4752.81s -> 4769.35s]  Oh my god. What about gin? Okay. Gin is awful. Gin might be the worst of all of them. Gin just
[4769.35s -> 4782.41s]  tastes like pine salt. Gin tastes like car air freshener. No. I don't think anybody, no. Gin is
[4782.41s -> 4788.39s]  one of those things that I think is very specific. And by the way gin and tonic reminds me of the
[4788.39s -> 4795.61s]  thing that like they would give fucking patients back in like the 1400s at the doctor's office.
[4795.61s -> 4803.11s]  It's awful. It's just awful. It just tastes awful. It's awful. Oh you know what kind of drink I want?
[4803.11s -> 4806.55s]  The shit that they used to give people before they sawed their legs off in like the fucking
[4806.55s -> 4811.93s]  1200s. No. Why would, why do we have so many options? Why would you choose that one?
[4814.01s -> 4826.50s]  You have so many choices. Why choose that? Drinking is immoral. You kind of.
[4826.90s -> 4842.73s]  How do I feel about tequila? I think a good tequila is okay. I think tequila has that same
[4842.73s -> 4848.92s]  kind of gross spectrum that vodka has. A really really like kind of shitty tequila is the same
[4848.92s -> 4856.97s]  thing as drinking the really shitty vodka. It's awful. I think tequila is good mixed with certain
[4856.97s -> 4862.49s]  things. I don't, I would never drink tequila. Like I mean why would you ever drink tequila straight?
[4863.37s -> 4868.26s]  Why would you drink vodka straight either? But like a vodka soda is essentially drinking vodka
[4869.06s -> 4874.50s]  without anything in it. A vodka soda with like a lime in it or something or a vodka like with
[4874.50s -> 4889.18s]  cranberry. That's pretty close. Fuck. I wasn't paying attention. I'll get it. Moscow mule. Moscow
[4889.18s -> 4895.22s]  mules are amazing. I love Moscow. A really good Moscow mule is awesome. I mean I haven't drank
[4895.22s -> 4904.07s]  alcohol in a very long time but you know just talking here. If I would think of my favorite
[4904.07s -> 4908.95s]  drink like what I would order and be happy with pretty much anywhere it would probably be a Moscow
[4908.95s -> 4914.23s]  mule or a vodka pineapple. Those are the only two drinks that I would like comfortably order
[4914.23s -> 4927.13s]  anywhere and be like okay I will probably like this. Anything else I would be like meh. Lots of
[4927.13s -> 4932.25s]  places have their own little drink menus where it's like oh here's our uh the special the special
[4932.25s -> 4939.85s]  like oh I can't even like I can't think of two like dumb like words that don't mean here's our uh
[4940.82s -> 4947.06s]  the sunrise into the sunset. I don't whatever they have the fucking dumb list and have the names
[4947.06s -> 4954.54s]  or the the Albert Einstein sunrise right. I don't but I don't order those. I think they're a little
[4954.54s -> 4964.20s]  too complicated. It's like oh like famous person and like a time of day. I don't I don't order the
[4964.20s -> 4984.66s]  famous person and time of day or weather drinks. They're like oh it's uh no Nikolai Teslas.
[4986.09s -> 4997.75s]  Raindrops like I don't know. I'm sorry. Kathy Mitchell's Express 101. I mean I would absolutely
[4997.75s -> 5003.37s]  what what I would order that. That sounds amazing. Uh why does this keep happening?
[5010.47s -> 5022.01s]  Are they gonna need batteries? Would you order a cloudy sandler? No. That's breaking the rule of
[5022.01s -> 5041.40s]  of like famous person and weather or time of day. I don't order those. What about absinthe?
[5041.78s -> 5053.16s]  I've never had absinthe before. I kind of don't want it. Kind of scary because I know it's like
[5053.16s -> 5058.28s]  oh yeah well absinthe back in the day they used to put uh like uh this like weird thing in it
[5058.28s -> 5063.14s]  that made you like hallucinate. I don't want I don't want that. They don't do that anymore right
[5063.14s -> 5071.82s]  but like I don't want it. That's not even true. I know but it's like a weird dumb like urban legend
[5071.82s -> 5081.82s]  around it. Yes I know I've read the chain email and I like believe the chain email but I don't
[5081.82s -> 5086.30s]  know. I just and it's like oh what you have to do is you have to take a sugar cube place it like
[5086.30s -> 5089.98s]  five feet above your head spin around pour it over no I just want to drink the fucking drink
[5089.98s -> 5100.90s]  I don't I don't know I don't want to do that or adjective and animal yeah that's another one
[5101.46s -> 5116.78s]  or adjective animal famous person time of day and weather the the the the Theodore Roosevelt
[5117.90s -> 5126.14s]  nighttime jack-o-lantern surprise bear you know I don't just add an adjective I'm trying to pay
[5126.14s -> 5139.85s]  attention to the game somebody just said we get it I know I'm just like I'm trying to pass the time
[5144.47s -> 5159.66s]  that's every word combo no it's not that's not every word combo what would my drink be though
[5160.65s -> 5165.29s]  what would the germa 985 be let's figure that out okay what would the germa 985 be
[5166.71s -> 5176.52s]  it would start start with some some good quality Tito's vodka you take the Tito's vodka fill it up
[5176.52s -> 5186.12s]  to about one two fingers then a splash of grenadine and then a little bit of soda water and then
[5187.51s -> 5197.24s]  squeeze a lemon squeeze a lime top it off with a little bit of pineapple juice and then put it in
[5197.24s -> 5203.78s]  the microwave for 10 seconds take it out of the microwave put ice in it stir stir stir stir stir
[5204.10s -> 5222.01s]  take the ice out and then put a parsley on it don't put it in the microwave I just imagine like
[5223.21s -> 5233.78s]  like in like a ceramic mug then light it on fire no and then throw it away
[5239.18s -> 5247.91s]  throw it away have the trash get taken out drive behind the trash truck it would have
[5247.91s -> 5251.51s]  absorbed a bunch of other shit at that point scoop it out of the truck when it gets to the dump
[5251.51s -> 5256.36s]  two ice cubes stir it up spin it up put it inside of one of those shakers
[5256.36s -> 5275.32s]  bring it to a priest they bless it gargle it gargle it gargle it oh fuck
[5280.65s -> 5287.58s]  put it down the toilet a delicious flush the toilet put the cup down with the water swirling
[5287.58s -> 5298.22s]  on the edge of the toilet to capture it onto the table another thing parsley and by the way it's
[5298.22s -> 5324.73s]  like $400 we get it top it off with a sneeze no 11 000 people are watching this shit
[5326.92s -> 5333.72s]  okay look I don't I don't choose the people that are watching this stream I'm just here
[5336.47s -> 5340.55s]  I can't like I'm sorry I'm sorry that there's been people are here
[5343.37s -> 5350.98s]  this bartender is crazy this is about just what I've been saying the whole time
[5351.62s -> 5370.79s]  I have 40 000 fucking dollars this is insane it's almost at level five by the way don't make that
[5370.79s -> 5375.03s]  drink that's stupid it's a dumb thing to do don't do it that was a funny like fucking routine we
[5375.03s -> 5390.95s]  were doing that concludes the uh the the message how would you even do I don't know now go gamble
[5390.95s -> 5398.84s]  everything let me get to level five I'll have 40 000 I'm good okay I'm done let's go donate it

[5429.82s -> 5448.09s]  make a large donation when the mystical sun reaches its zenith here we go okay everything
[5448.09s -> 5454.73s]  before the microwave that would be the germa 985 I didn't what was it it was a little bit of vodka
[5455.29s -> 5462.26s]  grenadine soda water squeeze a lemon squeeze a lime stir it up maybe a little bit pineapple juice

[6871.61s -> 6886.54s]  better than pouring beers for an hour that's the fable experience yeah I'm sorry though I
[6886.54s -> 6900.14s]  thought we had a pretty interesting conversation for that like the beer podcast wait even though

[7063.90s -> 7072.15s]  what the hell it's the medieval times god damn it what do you think was what are you talking about
[7072.15s -> 7104.31s]  one of them was somebody extorting you and they probably they had a gun in their back pocket
[7104.31s -> 7116.74s]  it was murder plus one heart okay here we go stay here this is I don't want you to get
[7116.74s -> 7131.26s]  hurt or killed or anything I'll be back see you later okay now let's go I really don't want her
[7131.26s -> 7141.24s]  to die medieval times doesn't mean murder is okay bandits are bad but murdering people was
[7141.24s -> 7148.97s]  still a very bad person behavior like people would just people would would fucking swing their
[7148.97s -> 7156.09s]  axes as people yeah murder was bad it always has been bad but I mean I'm walking around with a
[7156.09s -> 7171.54s]  fucking like a sword and a gun on my back and they're like bandits everywhere everybody does
[7171.54s -> 7176.98s]  it so I look so this guy's shooting at me with a rifle these people just look at this this is
[7176.98s -> 7190.97s]  what the medieval times were like look at this this is what it was like why did I lose so many
[7190.97s -> 7200.89s]  points what what what's going on they have bandits what's do you want me to not to do this
[7201.45s -> 7211.62s]  you should hit my dog that's not a civilian that was not okay that was not a civilian that was a
[7211.62s -> 7218.81s]  bandit I know I have magical fucking daggers that come out of my hands I'm talking about
[7218.81s -> 7235.14s]  like the nature of medieval times people with the guns no you know what I'm trying to say
[7235.14s -> 7265.90s]  all right I gotta help this guy that's a nice weapon but be careful I'm good there were no
[7265.90s -> 7276.70s]  streamers in the middle ages yeah there were no iPhones either no TVs there were no treadmills
[7277.58s -> 7281.83s]  oh hold on oh he didn't like that
[7284.58s -> 7286.10s]  steel mace no I don't want this
[7296.90s -> 7300.66s]  good observation yeah there were no there were no treadmills in the medieval ages right
[7300.66s -> 7306.09s]  see that's why I'm so that's why I'm so big uh the dog by the way has changed
[7311.11s -> 7324.87s]  horse troll dog is a retriever defeat the troll yeah the dog has changed into a golden retriever
[7336.02s -> 7356.78s]  too I'm too good watch out dog he's dead got it we do a little trolling here
[7361.58s -> 7376.44s]  oh nice there's a dig spot what's the what okay if you're evil if you're actually all the way to
[7376.44s -> 7394.55s]  the other end of the bar what does the dog look like Lucian's diary but it will do you a little
[7394.55s -> 7404.65s]  good without a translation bring it back to the guild coming this looks like it was meant to be
[7404.65s -> 7415.77s]  an MMO I I mean it was a pretty ambitious game for back 12 13 years ago longer than that right
[7415.77s -> 7427.19s]  with 14 what 12 13 how you can determine how ambitious a game was is did it come out before
[7427.19s -> 7441.91s]  or after GTA 4 GTA 4 ruined everything GTA 4 I believe was what 2007 2008 like if your game
[7441.91s -> 7450.25s]  was not as good as GTA 4 holy shit that changed that changed everything GTA 4 is like ambitious
[7450.25s -> 7456.17s]  game was like if you thought you had an ambitious game and your game came out before GTA 4 maybe
[7456.17s -> 7479.26s]  not after though you can read that but visor you know I see other worlds than this GTA 4 sucked
[7479.90s -> 7485.58s]  and in other worlds you can see I don't understand that's a that's a troll you make it that's just
[7487.42s -> 7495.43s]  Lucian is recruiting guards from Westcliff oh come on Westcliff's a dump full of pullers and thugs
[7495.43s -> 7499.91s]  the only thing there is that arena yeah GTA 4 was one of the best games ever made
[7499.91s -> 7505.27s]  it are physically tough and mentally weak Lucian is recruiting the winners as guards
[7506.57s -> 7512.95s]  you must enter the crucible in Westcliff and emerge from it victorious it is the only way into
[7512.95s -> 7520.57s]  the spire the only way to get to garth and rescue him I think a lot of you guys forget the kind of
[7520.57s -> 7528.55s]  interesting systems that were introduced in GTA 4 people being able to get like into fights and
[7528.55s -> 7532.55s]  stuff without you having to do anything about it people literally talking shit to each other
[7532.55s -> 7537.35s]  getting in car accidents and like a police showing up you didn't do anything that was very very
[7537.35s -> 7553.91s]  different than anything we've been used to like the AI engine that they came up with for GTA 4
[7553.91s -> 7579.32s]  was better than anything else before it just the way that people move remember that uh there was
[7579.32s -> 7586.55s]  that technology that I think rockstar acquired but like bumping into stuff and the AI moving
[7586.55s -> 7594.39s]  accordingly what was it called it was it was an actual technology about like AI reacting to things
[7594.39s -> 7603.59s]  euphoria right yep the act of like bumping somebody with your car and they interact with
[7603.59s -> 7609.46s]  the car with their arms and legs and body that was all AI that was huge that was ridiculous
[7609.46s -> 7614.98s]  because it was always just animations it was like oh this is you got hit by the car there's an
[7614.98s -> 7618.66s]  animation that plays after you got hit and it's like pretty much the same animation every time
[7618.66s -> 7624.54s]  the euphoria engine was just like holy shit wait like we can have people react to things the way
[7624.54s -> 7631.86s]  they actually would if they got bumped and it won't be just an animation that plays that was a
[7631.86s -> 7645.05s]  huge deal no not ragdolls not ragdoll physics existed well before that the act of the AI reacting
[7645.05s -> 7651.61s]  to stuff randomly if you bumped into them if they were hit by something it wasn't a ragdoll it was
[7651.61s -> 7665.85s]  the AI engine would react to getting touched in a certain way if you have if you have a few minutes
[7665.85s -> 7669.29s]  to go look up the euphoria engine and you'll see what i'm talking about it was revolutionary
[7669.29s -> 7674.09s]  no not ragdoll ragdoll is just the ragdoll is the whole rig just falls apart
[7674.09s -> 7700.31s]  don't look it up what procedural animation gta 4 invented physics you gotta get out of here
[7700.31s -> 7726.52s]  okay let's go i can't why can i not do more than 10 bucks oh i got nine free spins let's go come on

[7838.38s -> 7844.63s]  neither did i i remember they had one they had a something came out before fable 2 released
[7845.27s -> 7855.32s]  it was a game to make money to use in the game it was like a weird casino game hub games yeah
[7855.32s -> 7864.90s]  that's right it came out like a couple like a month or two before the game actually released
[7865.46s -> 7870.66s]  it was like xbox i was on xbox live like xbox live arcade or something
[7871.22s -> 7881.18s]  of games all right let's go all right i'm done i'm done i'm done i'm done imagine just walking

[8161.42s -> 8183.99s]  my that's not who i am oh it's nice to see another killer i'm not a killer killing bandits is okay
[8183.99s -> 8190.79s]  then who executes the executioner wait i kind of i may have missed what you said executing who
[8190.79s -> 8211.02s]  executes the executioner um okay are you fond of riddles why am i about to hear one three great
[8211.02s -> 8218.65s]  men sit in a hall a priest a rich man and a warrior each one bears the cell sword to kill
[8218.65s -> 8230.28s]  the other two who lives who dies he's of not favor of the crown nor of the of the church it depends
[8230.28s -> 8236.71s]  on the cell sword uh if it's cell swords we care about then what's the real who's the real power
[8236.71s -> 8244.66s]  his power his knowledge is power and a very small man can cast a very large shadow you know the
[8244.74s -> 8259.72s]  fucking bit by how i've been here for ages right let's go i think one of the most famous game of
[8259.72s -> 8275.16s]  thrones monologues i know we all hate that show but like the first few seasons were good lucy's
[8275.16s -> 8285.02s]  writings are fascinating there's much in them that they interest you press on to west give
[8285.02s -> 8289.26s]  yeah the first few seasons of game of thrones are some of the best television ever yeah it is
[8289.26s -> 8296.76s]  speaking of which area was completely overrun even the fourth and fifth seasons were they're
[8296.76s -> 8304.47s]  all right the four season was okay but once they got away from like the books it was just like
[8304.47s -> 8316.46s]  well whatever i guess this shit's gonna happen yeah well you see you see us at hboc george wrote
[8316.46s -> 8323.98s]  on the back of a piece of toilet paper uh like three major plot points and that was it and then
[8323.98s -> 8350.14s]  we just kind of made up everything else oh uppercut i think my main problem with game of thrones is
[8350.14s -> 8358.25s]  that it just i just don't ever want to watch it again like i was so excited to get new people
[8358.25s -> 8365.61s]  involved in that show it's like wow you've never seen game of thrones you didn't all the books oh
[8365.61s -> 8371.10s]  my god we're in the middle of like season three right now this is the greatest thing you will ever
[8371.10s -> 8377.26s]  this is our generations this is our generation's lord of the rings like this is our tolkien it's
[8377.26s -> 8383.18s]  right here and now it's just like i don't even want to i would never want to watch the whole
[8383.18s -> 8396.42s]  show again because i know what happened like i know what happens halfway through this is the lord of
[8396.42s -> 8406.79s]  the rings for like the millennial generation this is perfect it's what we can tell our kids about
[8406.87s -> 8418.36s]  like lord of the rings i kind of thought it was gonna have the same like cultural impact
[8418.36s -> 8433.77s]  and it did for a while until it didn't all the rings is overrated yeah well you could all right
[8433.77s -> 8442.17s]  you but the cultural impact of like lord of the rings on media and like fantasy media i don't care
[8442.17s -> 8455.94s]  how much you think is overrated it's like the same thing as dungeons and dragons for video games
[8457.11s -> 8461.43s]  the only reason why i'm shooting this guy with a rifle or hitting with a sword is because i got a
[8461.43s -> 8473.16s]  few guys started to create dungeons and dragons wait that was a horrible thing to do whatever

[11320.65s -> 11334.92s]  some more points to on the good side what do you need i was hoping you would return the temple is
[11334.92s -> 11341.56s]  in need of a protector once more we have always suffered at the hands of the vile cultists from
[11341.56s -> 11348.20s]  the temple of shadows but i fear they're preparing a major attack against us where are they it would
[11348.20s -> 11353.40s]  seem the shadow worshipers are planning to poison the holy water in the wellspring cave
[11354.68s -> 11359.48s]  if that happens the golden oak will die i can't have that it would mean the end of our order
[11359.48s -> 11366.58s]  perhaps even the end of the village and all its people you helped us once before will you do so
[11366.58s -> 11373.94s]  again i will as long as you give me i can put you down as a reference for me being a good person
[11374.50s -> 11381.02s]  first thing you must do is to check the statues from which the water pours forth
[11381.02s -> 11386.68s]  ensure they haven't been contaminated with the taint of evil the shadow worshipers are
[11386.68s -> 11391.56s]  likely to target the main chamber next but you mustn't allow them to desecrate it
[11394.39s -> 11409.83s]  okay let's go kill some shadow worshipers i really should level up the gun stuff
[11410.47s -> 11413.59s]  i think the guns are more fun than magic but i'm okay it's kind of too late
[11415.74s -> 11422.68s]  not really though all right hold on will shock three which would be pretty good blades
[11423.24s -> 11436.22s]  four sixty four thousand eight hundred that's three four five that's close vortex four
[11441.35s -> 11456.20s]  hmm time control might be kind of cool i use shock all the time i feel like that's so cool
[11461.02s -> 11477.98s]  vortex four let's do it sell the skills back with why i'll just sell chaos back i'm not
[11477.98s -> 11489.62s]  going to use it all right ray there's also rays dead which would be kind of cool
[11492.63s -> 11499.83s]  all right accuracy 36 000 extra here we go ranged aim i can now do it now
[11500.98s -> 11508.10s]  hold y to enter aim mode click left or right while you're locked on enemy to instantly
[11508.10s -> 11523.83s]  switch to other targets okay speed might as well just get it let's see so you do i have to hold
[11523.83s -> 11533.05s]  it the whole time oh i have to hold it the whole time if i want to stay in there that's kind of
[11533.05s -> 11540.14s]  cool i can now headshot people oh dear do the shooting contest all right let me hold on let
[11540.14s -> 11556.38s]  me let me do this part first got vortex four oh this takes some bomb all right if i'm going
[11556.38s -> 11566.42s]  to do vortex four then that means i don't i'll do blades three vortex four and then shock one and
[11566.42s -> 11578.38s]  shock two that sounds good to me does the game have bubsy 3d tank controls no i mean it's a it's
[11578.38s -> 11603.54s]  a little floaty but i wouldn't say it's that ridiculous bubsy isn't floaty well i mean i
[11603.54s -> 11613.08s]  didn't say bubsy was floaty i said this was floaty oh my god walk over it what's wrong with you

[12070.97s -> 12084.54s]  that's it almost everyone in westcliff has heard about you for better or worse cool now you can go
[12084.54s -> 12108.87s]  back to the crucible gatekeeper all right let's go back to uh mad dog and murray the shooting
[12108.87s -> 12123.83s]  gallery yeah not funny do something funny tell the do something funny story or sing the doing
[12123.83s -> 12130.17s]  something funny song i like that comment okay where's the shooting gallery
[12134.12s -> 12154.95s]  oh fortune's tower sure i actually forget how this one's played pressing your luck played with
[12154.95s -> 12159.19s]  a unique deck of cards a deck contains mostly number cards ranked from one through seven plus
[12159.19s -> 12168.95s]  a here plus four hero cards this deck contains eight of each card ranked one through seven
[12169.43s -> 12176.55s]  uh other decks may contain nine or even ten sets okay place a bet to start the game your bet must
[12176.55s -> 12186.89s]  be 15 gold or some multiple of 15 here the dealer starts by dealing three cards the first card is
[12186.89s -> 12192.09s]  facedown and is called the gate card the next two cards are faced up and create the second row there
[12192.09s -> 12201.13s]  can be as many as eight rows if you play all the way to the bottom of the tower all right this is
[12201.13s -> 12207.05s]  the starting deal on each row you have a choice you may take the dealer's offer or deal another
[12207.05s -> 12211.70s]  row the dealer's offer is equal to the total value of cards in the row on this role the offer
[12211.70s -> 12217.69s]  is nine remember you bet 15 you cash out now for nine gold to push on and hope for a higher value
[12217.69s -> 12224.26s]  push on all right row three would be worth 18 but wait you've also caught a vertical pair
[12224.26s -> 12231.42s]  pairs such as this will often end the game but not always all right same rank on the previous row
[12231.98s -> 12241.59s]  here will cause misfortune ending the game with a value of zero okay okay here's a worth zero
[12241.59s -> 12250.79s]  go but they keep it from safe from pairs okay all right ah this is stupid i don't just whatever i
[12250.79s -> 12266.17s]  just go when an entire row matches you get more money all right let's go i i get it i don't care

[16098.06s -> 16109.86s]  what in the name of fucking god i'm holding why right now it doesn't make any sense it's just
[16109.86s -> 16119.96s]  it's as if i'm not touching why i don't know why it's doing that this would have been pretty
[16119.96s -> 16130.44s]  close to is the controller busted no it's called caring about fucking rain and dropping your fps
[16130.44s -> 16141.11s]  of the whole game by 20 that was gonna be so close to use a mouse this game's not on pc
[16149.26s -> 16154.10s]  i'm gonna hold why right now because i don't understand why it's doing this
[16156.97s -> 16172.42s]  i'm gonna hold why i'm holding why right now i'm not gonna let it go why is it stopping that
[16172.42s -> 16203.69s]  that doesn't make any sense i wish i had an explanation for you can you toggle it no this
[16203.69s -> 16208.49s]  is one of those it's one of those games it just has every button has like four different contexts
[16208.49s -> 16215.45s]  of when to press it and when to hold it like why is shoot hold why is aim you remember when
[16215.45s -> 16220.41s]  every fucking goddamn game is doing this like contextual gameplay mechanic presses oh i hated

[17419.02s -> 17434.44s]  thing to say about that once you know are you is he talking shit about how bad i was at the
[17434.52s -> 17456.20s]  shooting game serving us drinks in full costume wow
[17467.58s -> 17472.65s]  this is 500 bucks every single time i should just sit here until it's 50 000
