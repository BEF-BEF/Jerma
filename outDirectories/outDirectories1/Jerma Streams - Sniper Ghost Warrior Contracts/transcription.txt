[1.46s -> 13.24s]  23 hours and 55 minutes early for tomorrow's stream because this one didn't turn on before
[13.24s -> 20.09s]  two. I see what you're saying. So this is actually tomorrow's stream. I didn't stream today. This is
[20.09s -> 34.60s]  tomorrow's stream. Anyways, uh, hello. How are you? Welcome back. I'm going to be playing some sniper
[34.60s -> 42.22s]  ghost warrior contracts today. I saw it pop up on steam and I'm like, you know what?
[43.02s -> 52.92s]  I'm, I want, we played the last sniper game. We played the last two sniper games, the last two
[52.92s -> 56.84s]  sniper elite and then sniper go. I think pretty sure we played both of them when they came out.
[57.72s -> 64.55s]  So there is a backup plan. If, uh, if I don't think this is fun, if I'm just like, nah, I don't think
[64.55s -> 70.89s]  so. Uh, I got dusk, which is just everybody, everybody loves that game. I've never played
[70.89s -> 75.53s]  it personally, but, and we could also, there's a bit, we got like a bunch of other like mystery
[75.53s -> 82.22s]  games we could play. So who cares? I probably shouldn't even said dusk because now everyone's
[82.22s -> 88.06s]  far going to be like, just, just do that instead. Just play dusk instead. But no,
[90.10s -> 94.34s]  I am a AAA video gamer right now. I want to play the new AAA video games and the new AAA
[94.34s -> 100.89s]  game that came out yesterday was sniper ghost warrior contracts too. It's not a AAA game.
[100.89s -> 105.53s]  I know, but give me a second. Uh, I'm going to get it over on the screen here and we'll get started.
[105.53s -> 145.00s]  Give me one sec. All right. Let's chill for a second here. I've got to warn you.
[146.20s -> 159.90s]  You're about to get your eyes blown out. So just be ready. Ready? One, two, three. It's bright as
[159.90s -> 170.02s]  hell. It's very bright. I don't know why this screen is this bright, but it is. So in sniper
[170.10s -> 176.47s]  ghost warrior contracts, it's your job as the hit man to, I have no idea.
[177.82s -> 189.34s]  I didn't even, guys, I did not even read the description of this game. Greetings,
[189.34s -> 195.59s]  mercenary. I represent a third party who wishes to make use of your specialist skills.
[196.92s -> 201.32s]  Nice. We are aware of your usual fees and are comfortable meeting the cost.
[201.88s -> 205.00s]  In fact, you've seen my last place for you to execute.
[207.27s -> 212.55s]  All are in the newly formed Siberian Republic. Skip, skip. No, I'm not skipping. This gets on
[212.55s -> 219.67s]  screen. Siberia was once part of the Russian Federation. Was it? Whoa. Siberia's huge natural
[219.67s -> 225.83s]  resources to bolster Russian economic success. Russia had a shitload of gold, but Siberia was
[225.83s -> 230.63s]  that sand from this relationship. In fact, it was mainly exploited and used
[231.51s -> 237.56s]  a political movement was established. The people for an independent Siberia,
[239.37s -> 243.77s]  even the regional governor, Mergui, Kurchatov was swept up in the wave,
[245.29s -> 251.21s]  joining the movement and cutting off Siberia from the Kremlin. The Siberian war of independence
[251.21s -> 258.73s]  followed Russia contained many Siberians and defections were right. The war was over quickly.
[259.53s -> 265.05s]  Kurchatov became Siberia's first prime minister, governing his new country with his family and
[265.05s -> 272.17s]  friends. Dude, it even has, okay. Just read the subtitles for a second. It even has the like,
[273.85s -> 278.49s]  spreading out the hitman shit, like the little wire frames and the white and the...
[279.78s -> 285.38s]  All right, let's keep our... Declared war against their government. They attacked oil fields and
[285.38s -> 292.42s]  stole state assets. Their leader, Nastya Tsurikova, has now become a hero to the people
[293.14s -> 299.70s]  and Kurchatov's nemesis. Our proposal comes with one requirement. You will need to wear a new
[299.70s -> 304.74s]  high-tech mask. You have to wear a Halloween mask. It will facilitate direct communication.
[304.74s -> 310.26s]  Nobody can tell who you are. But there are other benefits for you, including combat enhancements.
[310.26s -> 317.94s]  My designation will be handler. Yours will be seeker. I look forward to working with you.
[317.94s -> 328.10s]  I gotta wear an Andros mask? I think that thing's cold and... We're in Siberia, right?
[328.74s -> 334.02s]  That thing looked like it was made out of steel. You want me to wear a steel mask on my face
[334.82s -> 349.05s]  in like negative 12 degrees? That thing's not coming off. All right, here we go. Proving
[349.05s -> 354.28s]  grounds complete the tutorial. Let's take a look at the details so I know what I'm working with here.
[355.00s -> 364.54s]  All right, it's just a top-down view. Cool. Start the contract. Marksman. Game difficulty
[364.54s -> 368.14s]  has decreased. Enemies are less aware. They see and hear the player only when he's near.
[368.94s -> 375.54s]  Enemy's weapon damage is reduced. Standard game, right? Enemies are aware of the player. They see
[375.54s -> 380.74s]  and hear the player from the standard distance. Enemy's weapon damage is on a standard, normal,
[380.74s -> 386.02s]  regular level. Perfect for me. Game has increased difficulty. Enemies are much more aware of the
[386.02s -> 391.30s]  player. They spot the player easily in the open and hear him from the greater distance.
[391.86s -> 396.92s]  Enemy's weapon damage is increased. That's not real. Everyone that says play on the hard
[396.92s -> 403.86s]  difficulty don't... That's not the real difficulty. Enemy's weapon damage is increased. What are they
[403.86s -> 407.94s]  using for bullets? What's the difference? Why can they hear me from five miles away? That's not
[407.94s -> 418.55s]  real. This is the real difficulty. This is the realistic one. Greetings, seeker. You should have
[418.55s -> 424.71s]  already received the mask. It is a highly advanced prototype that enhances your capacity in the field
[424.71s -> 431.40s]  and syncs with your equipment. The mask allows you to upload contracts data to the client after
[431.40s -> 438.97s]  each mission. Before we drop you in the designated location, we want to make sure you understand the
[438.97s -> 445.45s]  tech we've given you. For this purpose, you'll be taken to a secure training facility hidden in a
[445.45s -> 450.89s]  secluded mountain location. You're going to perform a series of simple tasks to familiarize
[450.89s -> 455.69s]  yourself with the mask and for us to make the necessary adjustments. Report back when you're
[455.69s -> 469.50s]  at the location, seeker. All right, here we go. It's time. Do I need to know what lore is and
[469.50s -> 473.90s]  shit? I'm not just gonna jump in without knowing anything. I don't know anything about sniping.
[473.90s -> 477.90s]  Hopefully this is not realistic at all because hopefully I just aim crosshair on guys' head.
[478.62s -> 482.62s]  I hope it's not one of those things where I have to do like the distance and then left and then
[483.66s -> 490.74s]  because otherwise I'm just going to not play the game. Ready for action.
[494.39s -> 512.86s]  Dude, turn the game down on your mic, man. Like a rifle. Okay, hold on. This is like,
[512.86s -> 516.46s]  the graphics are too good right now. I need to like turn them down. I'm not kidding.
[517.10s -> 528.12s]  Doesn't it? I don't know. I must be an old fucking man. I swear to God. But I actually like it when
[528.12s -> 532.36s]  games don't look like insanely incredible and shit. I like it when they look kind of like crap.
[533.32s -> 540.79s]  All right, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay, approach the sniping spot. What about these?
[540.79s -> 546.71s]  What is this? Refill ammo. All right, ammo. I got 525. All right, approach sniping spot.
[546.71s -> 552.15s]  Take a prone position. Hold C to go prone. Press tab to open the tutorial. You got the reading
[552.15s -> 558.78s]  tutorial. They still haven't figured out how to do tutorials in all video games, huh? I know I just
[559.34s -> 567.42s]  did an R instead of a W. I'm stupid. This takes me out. It does. If you guys notice that, that the
[567.42s -> 572.70s]  tutorial always just takes you out. Instead of being like telling me these things as a little
[572.70s -> 583.82s]  robot in my ear, I have to like, what am I reading a book right now? Okay, crouch stance. Hold C to
[583.82s -> 590.73s]  go prone. Okay, changing stance to crouch. Reduces weapon sway. All right. And hold your breath.
[590.73s -> 596.52s]  You have this hold breath mechanic. Cool. All right. Note that only tall grass and bushes provide
[596.52s -> 600.44s]  fall cover. Good to know. You got to stay on a bar. It'll increase when you perform physical
[600.44s -> 603.40s]  actions like running and climbing, but it regenerates. Otherwise, your stamina level
[603.40s -> 608.41s]  determines how long you can hold your breath. Okay, so that's important. Let's go. First,
[608.41s -> 617.00s]  switch your mask to binocular mode. Target over there. Tagging enemies allows you to measure the
[617.00s -> 625.32s]  distance to selected targets and keep track of the system to measure your target's distance.
[626.89s -> 631.13s]  Why do I need to use binoculars when I have a huge binocular on my arm?
[631.13s -> 637.61s]  Rifle and see for yourself. This is just a giant binocular.
[643.32s -> 655.53s]  This system scales up the display.
[655.53s -> 664.17s]  All right. I shoot the target. So it eight. So 117 meters. That means I have to go.
[664.17s -> 669.70s]  What do I have to aim? That means I have to go up a little bit, right?
[673.29s -> 684.81s]  Below 100. That's too far. So okay, so if I'm zoomed in that 100 right there, I got to go
[684.81s -> 705.16s]  a little bit above that. So like right here, higher than that. See for me, it's just,
[705.16s -> 710.25s]  just guess for me. You know what I'm saying? Proceed to the next one.
[717.74s -> 729.83s]  So that's the wind check target. Aim along bullet drop cone. Shit. Okay. He's 150 away.
[731.13s -> 741.70s]  So I have to like drop this on his head. So he's 150. Yeah, I know.
[765.78s -> 771.22s]  What? Okay. QE. This is, this is the mechanic I was talking about the elevation button.
[772.18s -> 801.46s]  280. Like that. Like that. So that's 280. Right. That's correct. Right. That's 100. What do
[801.46s -> 812.44s]  you mean it's 100 on the right? 100. All right. Wait, hold on. I've got to ask a question.
[812.44s -> 816.68s]  Do the, this is where anytime I play sniper game, just listen to me closely. I know. Just please
[816.68s -> 822.28s]  listen to me. Hear me out. Do the numbers on the middle of the screen in yellow,
[822.84s -> 834.15s]  orange mean fucking anything? Yes. No. Yes. Yeah. That's what I'm saying. Okay. So this is at 280
[834.15s -> 852.95s]  right now. So here's, this is who said no wrong aim. This is wrong. This is not correct.
[854.52s -> 858.84s]  I have so much trouble with these. I have so much trouble with these games. I swear to God,
[858.84s -> 863.08s]  I knew it. I have so much trouble with this shit. And I know I should know what I'm doing,
[863.08s -> 869.82s]  but I don't. Because I've changed the scope. The wind. I know the wind is going down though.
[871.18s -> 882.60s]  I can't. I can't do it. I have to guess. Got it. I think that is a rule. What is the one on the
[882.60s -> 888.41s]  top mean? I'm going to sit here until I get it. I don't care if it takes five hours. The top left,
[888.41s -> 897.06s]  see two, three, four, six. Right. What does that, what does that mean? The top left is wind speed.
[898.49s -> 903.13s]  Okay. So that doesn't mean there's nothing to do with the, the, this three, four, five, six shit.
[903.85s -> 912.95s]  I know. Okay. I know the top one is wind. I've played plenty of golf games. I know how that works.
[913.59s -> 929.27s]  It's a, it's a scale so you can find the distance. Bottom is distance in meters. So this top left
[929.27s -> 935.99s]  one is the wind direction. See one, two, three, four, six. That's wind direction. Bottom is bullet
[935.99s -> 944.33s]  drop. People are just, every time I've tried, I've tried many times. I thought I, you know,
[944.33s -> 948.73s]  I'm fucking staying until I figure it out. Just shoot him. I'm just going to, I'm just going to
[948.73s -> 961.06s]  shoot him. I almost got him. Just shoot him. Get in discord so somebody can explain this.
[967.22s -> 988.31s]  How do I take this back? How far away is this guy? Everyone's flooding discord. You think I'm going
[988.31s -> 1000.26s]  to be able to get explained to me on discord? Damn it. It is, it's like hard and you need to
[1000.26s -> 1006.74s]  like know what you're doing. I, all I know is wind and this thing of that, the cascading
[1006.74s -> 1013.59s]  particle effect. All right. I'm going to slow down. We're going to start at the very beginning.
[1016.38s -> 1024.46s]  Here we go. Right now I am not, I'm at, I'm not zoomed in at all. Okay. I'm not zoomed in.
[1026.73s -> 1033.85s]  When I go one tick forward, this, the numbers change here. Can someone just give me a basic
[1033.85s -> 1038.41s]  explanation as to why when I do one tick in at times eight, these numbers in front of me change.
[1039.05s -> 1042.89s]  Like they go down, like it's going down, but that's just, no, they're not changing.
[1042.89s -> 1048.33s]  I'm getting closer. Okay. So I figured that out. Just bear with me. I'm a koala for God's sake.
[1049.50s -> 1061.56s]  So right now, what the, that number, that 100 means what? That's distance. The top left numbers
[1061.56s -> 1068.17s]  are height scale. So that means that this guy, but how do I know he's a hundred meters away?
[1068.89s -> 1072.89s]  What are these, what are the lines in the middle mean? It will hit at a hundred meters if you
[1072.89s -> 1081.86s]  compensate. Thank you. Thank you. That's what I wanted. So if I compensate, I'll hit this guy.
[1082.66s -> 1089.11s]  You have to mark him first, right? Okay. Let's mark and see how far away he is.
[1089.99s -> 1101.80s]  Okay. All right. So he's 114 meters away. So that see 200, that's how far away he is. It'll
[1101.80s -> 1107.00s]  hit him in the chest, right? It'll hit him right in the chest. If I compensate right there, right?
[1111.78s -> 1124.71s]  So right there. So this is going to hit him right in the fucking head. Okay. I get it. I understand.
[1124.71s -> 1130.47s]  So what? Okay. This is where I got fucked up. It always, what are these numbers in the two, three,
[1130.47s -> 1141.77s]  four, six? What's that mean? What does the two, three, four, six mean? No clue. Omega low. Ignore
[1141.77s -> 1150.17s]  those. Well, aren't I supposed to know? Just ignore the top left. See, I'm under the assumption that
[1150.17s -> 1158.47s]  I have to make some fucking calculation with the stuff in the top left. All right. I get it.
[1163.22s -> 1173.53s]  This is a real tricky one for me here. 262. You understand? Check this out. 262. Look at that.
[1173.53s -> 1180.90s]  That's a headshot right there. It only took me 20 minutes to figure out how to play the fucking
[1180.90s -> 1188.23s]  game. Now, now I can play any sniper game because I always get to this part and quit.
[1188.23s -> 1198.10s]  I said that's not a joke. I, every sniper game that has this mechanic in it.
[1198.90s -> 1203.38s]  I, I can't figure out this first part and then I just quit again. All right. Important. I have
[1203.38s -> 1211.70s]  something really important to ask guys. What's this shit do? This like 200, 240, like 500.
[1213.19s -> 1220.68s]  That's just changing what that's to fine tune it. So if I want to, let's say the guys, let's say the
[1220.68s -> 1224.76s]  guy's like 600 meters away, right? And I'm just like, fuck, I can't, how am I supposed to tell?
[1226.06s -> 1230.70s]  So there we go. Six, it's like 600 meters that I hit him right in the head. If I compensate for the
[1230.70s -> 1238.52s]  wind, let's just say the guy's back there. All right. That was fucking ridiculous. Cause I may
[1238.52s -> 1249.61s]  as well just, I, I, I, that's how it was. What? It always seems like it's like impossible. All
[1249.61s -> 1254.02s]  right. Right, right. Cause I'm like, I'm zoomed the fuck in. So how far away is this guy? I don't
[1254.02s -> 1258.34s]  know. Who cares? Shoot him right in the light. All right. I'm ready. I'm ready. I think I
[1258.34s -> 1263.58s]  understand. That's how real guns work. That's all right. That's fine. All right. Let's go.
[1264.22s -> 1282.39s]  Is there no scope? Oh, we've got a live exercise here. Short range, special bullets,
[1283.50s -> 1289.11s]  pick up one of the weapons to try out different sets of special. This technology will increase
[1289.11s -> 1294.63s]  your options in the field and allow you to be more creative. Ooh, test a turret or pick up a
[1294.63s -> 1301.86s]  sniper rifle to test special bullets. What's wrong with one I have explosive. I just burped
[1301.86s -> 1304.82s]  while I was talking and that's why it sounded like that. All right. Let's do explosive.
[1305.70s -> 1326.38s]  Press. Oh, there we go. Use explosive to hit targets. They detonate on impact. How do I know
[1326.38s -> 1331.34s]  how far away that is though? Let me find out. How far away is this? I can't, I don't know.
[1331.90s -> 1334.94s]  How come I, I can't tell how far away that is. I'm fucking, I'm useless.
[1349.82s -> 1355.50s]  That was just huge targets. Okay. Cool. They, that's actually pretty fun. Do it again. Sure.
[1356.22s -> 1368.50s]  Let's reload. All right. That's fun. Pick up an ammo box. What do we got here? We got armor
[1368.50s -> 1381.99s]  piercing. What's what is DARPA? EMP DARPA. What's DARPA do? Top left lets you see distance based on
[1381.99s -> 1392.30s]  dude's heights. So wait, hold on. You're telling me that that that guy's 200 meters away. What if
[1392.30s -> 1407.67s]  I go like this? Can I just trick myself? No, that's not how it works. Put it on their feet. I'll put
[1407.67s -> 1417.32s]  the line, put their feet on the line. It's like that. So this guy's 212, 15. Yeah. All right.
[1417.32s -> 1423.85s]  Well, how the, I don't know. I've never used this before in my life. All right. DARPA bullets.
[1429.24s -> 1432.60s]  This is actually pretty good because now I won't rage quit every single sniper game I've ever
[1432.60s -> 1448.90s]  played. I don't have to compensate for gravity or wind. How do I get a box of these? Can I just
[1448.90s -> 1454.82s]  have these? This is just cheating. All right. I'm just going to get a bunch of those.
[1455.54s -> 1467.21s]  All right. I get, I understand how it works, but I want to see what this is. Luring tagging, luring.
[1473.24s -> 1483.59s]  Why would there be ammo to luring? Dude, this is sick. All right. So now you tell me if I go,
[1483.59s -> 1490.07s]  I'm going to just let me just let me listen to me. This here. So you tell me that this thing
[1490.07s -> 1503.14s]  is a hundred meters away. Dope. All right. Well, no, we don't need to go that far then. All right.
[1503.14s -> 1507.70s]  Tagging. So what am I supposed to do? Tag it or lure? How do I, there's nobody even over here.
[1507.70s -> 1520.63s]  Just shoot the ground. These guys can't even walk. It doesn't be luring people. Is it just
[1520.63s -> 1528.62s]  making noise? He's blind. What? This is a luring bullet. I mean, these guys aren't moving though.
[1530.76s -> 1534.44s]  Cardboard people can't walk. That's what I know. But how targets can't walk. All right. Well,
[1536.47s -> 1541.37s]  no, I wasn't about to leave the game. Switch to tagging bullets. What do tagging bullets do?
[1541.37s -> 1551.42s]  Probably tag people. Pick up turret. Hold to open weapon wheel and select remote turret.
[1552.06s -> 1560.10s]  Am I going to snipe a turret? Plus F to place turret. Where? Like if I, do I call in a turret
[1560.10s -> 1574.68s]  call? Press T and switch your mass to binocular mode. Tag targets for remote turret. While in,
[1574.68s -> 1590.33s]  what? While in binocular, press H to tag up to two targets. Press H. Press G. Where the hell is
[1590.33s -> 1608.73s]  this thing? Press F to put the turret down first. Okay. I'm going to put the turret down. All right.
[1608.73s -> 1627.70s]  I got my turret. Let's see. Tag these guys. H. Shoot these guys. Huh? From this far away.
[1630.60s -> 1643.06s]  I thought this, I thought this was like you put it down short range. Uh, all right. EMP. I think I
[1643.06s -> 1646.98s]  know what that does. I know what that does. It pierces armor. All right. I know what tagging does.
[1646.98s -> 1654.49s]  It tags people. Let's just make sure I know what it does. That's a hitscan weapon. That's a little
[1654.49s -> 1663.18s]  strange. All right. Let's, all right. We go. Let's just go like this. Watch that wind. All right.
[1663.18s -> 1679.53s]  Let's tag. All right. I'm ready. I'm ready. I get it. All right. What do I go if I get it?
[1700.86s -> 1703.82s]  Just, I'm just going to get the turret. That's all I care about.
[1704.70s -> 1711.90s]  This thing is not even in line of sight. That's really, really fun. Okay. Here we go. Let's get,
[1711.90s -> 1715.74s]  we got an AK. We've got a pistol. We got bullets. We got grenades. This grenades in this game.
[1715.74s -> 1727.58s]  Automatic plus one letter grid. All right. Press F to use selected gadget. I hate when I get
[1735.64s -> 1759.94s]  cold. AK. Good. Really loud though. Let's, let's, let's fix that. All right. Let's see if I can get
[1759.94s -> 1779.32s]  them all. Pretty good. All right. How do I leave? All right. If I hit the guy all the way in the
[1779.32s -> 1798.44s]  back and he drops right now, I get a hundred alls. Oh well. You guys ready? I am. Okay.
[1798.44s -> 1806.84s]  Altai mountains. Download Ivanovsky's plans. Find the client spy. Eliminate Demetri. Destroy
[1806.84s -> 1820.89s]  all test results. Steal samples of the virus. I thought this was a sniper game. What happened
[1820.89s -> 1831.26s]  to where's snipe the bad guy? What? Interrogate officers. Perform headshots. Gas enemies. Eliminate
[1831.26s -> 1837.94s]  without. What is all this? What is all this? Inter, how do I interrogate somebody from five
[1837.94s -> 1860.14s]  miles away? Greetings Seeker. Just do it. Your primary target is Demetri Ivanovsky. He is a
[1860.22s -> 1867.27s]  former Russian armed forces general. He earned the nickname bio-efficacy. You call them.
[1867.27s -> 1872.94s]  During the second Mongolian war. Due to his persistent use of both chemical and biological weapons.
[1872.94s -> 1879.34s]  You called. His first cousin to the Siberian. That's so funny because it's, I mean, yeah.
[1880.46s -> 1885.98s]  During the Siberian war of independence. You ping their walkie-talkie. You just prank call them.
[1885.98s -> 1894.34s]  Cousin. Kurtadov gave him the notorious Altai 24 Soviet military research facility as thanks
[1894.34s -> 1901.02s]  for his support. Yeah. You hold the walkie-talkie and you go, what do you know? Tell me what you
[1901.02s -> 1905.10s]  know. And you smack the walkie-talkie like on a table. And then he goes on the other end.
[1905.98s -> 1911.10s]  All right. All right. All right. He's in the back room. Human trials of his bio-weapon.
[1911.66s -> 1919.77s]  Understand that Kurtadov plans to use the weapon to secure Siberia's disputed border territories.
[1921.13s -> 1930.71s]  Stored on an encrypted military grade laptop. Find the package, hack it and obtain those plans.
[1933.26s -> 1938.78s]  All right. I understand it's cold looking and there's a lot going on on the screen, but
[1938.78s -> 1948.70s]  what is this supposed to be? What these lines and the geometry, wires, what is this supposed to be?
[1950.06s -> 1965.05s]  A computer or what are we supposed to be looking at? A video? Hacking. It's like what hacking looks
[1965.05s -> 1973.32s]  like. It just defects in the camera. I just, I guess it looks maybe like on a poster or something,
[1973.32s -> 1984.49s]  but I don't know. Whatever. All right. Let's go. Alpaya. Your first objective is to infiltrate
[1984.49s -> 1990.57s]  the enemy's facility. It's behind the electric fence. You'll have to cut the power. We've dropped
[1990.57s -> 1998.18s]  your weapons nearby. Load your map to see the cargo drop off point. All right. Let's go. Do I even
[1998.18s -> 2008.14s]  have a sniper rifle? Open M. Blue areas indicate contact locations. That's a lot of, that's a huge,
[2008.14s -> 2016.90s]  this is the legend that you see at a mall. Okay. There's, there's the target. Okay. Where's the,
[2017.70s -> 2024.26s]  where's the Nordstrom? This is a mall directory. So here, this is the box I have to go to.
[2024.98s -> 2037.91s]  So just go. Can I put a waypoint? Yep. Thank God. I'll update your map with
[2037.91s -> 2043.03s]  coordinates related to your contracts. You can load it via your mask at any time.
[2043.03s -> 2047.99s]  You can manually mark waypoints on your map. They'll be displayed directly on your map.
[2047.99s -> 2055.91s]  All right. You can fall off. You can fall off the edge. Okay. Cool. I need some games. Don't let
[2055.91s -> 2062.38s]  you do that. That's plus five. That's a, that's plus 0.2 points. So this is all right. I'm not,
[2062.38s -> 2067.26s]  I was just testing to see if you could fall. It's behind the electric fence. You'll have to
[2067.26s -> 2078.74s]  cut the power. What force causes me to hypothetical. All right. So I'm ready. Cool. Let's go.
[2080.10s -> 2084.66s]  Coordinates related to your contracts. You can load it for your mask at any time.
[2085.22s -> 2089.86s]  You can manually mark waypoints on your map. They'll be displayed directly on your mask.
[2091.22s -> 2097.34s]  Yep. All right. Jump. That's a pretty floaty jump. All right. Jump plus climb on. How do I do that?
[2097.34s -> 2105.83s]  Just jump and hold. This is not the video game I thought it was going to be, and neither did you.
[2106.79s -> 2128.73s]  So let's go. Dead end. Use your mask scanner. I have a scanner?
[2131.61s -> 2136.28s]  Now what would happen in real life is if you went that far up to a huge building like this,
[2136.28s -> 2147.75s]  you would just fall backwards. What was it? Left control? Uh, what? I don't know.
[2149.00s -> 2152.73s]  It just makes everything kind of ugly. What is this showing me?
[2161.88s -> 2176.78s]  Is there an indicator besides the triangle stuff? The pipes. I mean, I see the pipes,
[2176.78s -> 2194.57s]  but what's the point of having the sniper vision on this? Okay. Cool. I can jump that high?
[2196.84s -> 2204.76s]  No, you cannot. Is there a flashlight? There's no way I can jump that far down.
[2204.76s -> 2209.72s]  Your suit is made from extremely durable, intelligent microfibers that also support
[2209.72s -> 2215.96s]  your body's natural regeneration abilities. Yeah. Health bar regenerates, drain stops when
[2215.96s -> 2219.64s]  you receive damage or sprint and use med kit to full health and adrenaline shot boost regeneration.
[2220.20s -> 2224.28s]  Yeah. You have a stamina bar. You hold your breath and shit. I get it. Your mask sinks
[2224.28s -> 2228.76s]  with your central nervous system. It was killing enhancing your reflexes and coordination.
[2229.40s -> 2234.68s]  Meaning you will be fine. Meaning it's going to instantly break both of my legs and then
[2234.68s -> 2244.52s]  heal them instantly. So I'm still going to feel the pain both ways. See? And now they're being
[2244.60s -> 2263.30s]  restructured. How do you save the game? You don't. You don't. I say flashlight. Use my sniper vision.
[2263.30s -> 2275.32s]  I still don't understand what the fuck this does. Take him down. When the recognition bar fits.
[2276.95s -> 2283.69s]  Wow. Is this stealth? A stealth action first person shooter game? While crouching, you'll be
[2283.69s -> 2288.09s]  less visible and quieter. Your silhouette turns black and HUD becomes darker when you are hidden.
[2288.09s -> 2293.42s]  Right? The recognition bar fills up when the enemies start noticing you. When it's full and
[2293.42s -> 2306.87s]  it's flashing red, you're detected. That's the same indicator. Stealth kill. Press mo when prompted
[2306.87s -> 2312.31s]  to perform a silent melee attack. You can also kill enemies when hiding below their field of vision
[2312.31s -> 2319.75s]  or jump them from above. If you sneak behind an enemy, you can interrogate him. A successful
[2319.75s -> 2324.79s]  interrogation provides information on supplies or hostile soldiers locations. Officers who can
[2324.79s -> 2328.55s]  be found at every outpost can provide you with mission relevant. Let's interrogate this person.
[2329.27s -> 2344.15s]  Where are they? Sniper vision. Is he talking to himself? What do you know?
[2351.56s -> 2357.40s]  Oh, I didn't even do that. I didn't click that. He just did it. He did that. I didn't do it.
[2358.28s -> 2374.33s]  Oh my god. You can hide. I didn't even kill this guy. Grab body. Holy shit. You throw them far.
[2374.41s -> 2385.06s]  What? Okay. He's hidden. Wait. Duck. All right. There's a hiding place over there. Wait. There's
[2385.06s -> 2401.10s]  enemies over here. Hiding place. All right. Approach this. He begged for his life. I did not kill that
[2401.10s -> 2432.60s]  guy. Oh shit. Throw a stone. Hold Q and A. You can throw rocks in this game. Oh shit. Prone. Oh,
[2432.60s -> 2450.04s]  I hit him in the fucking head. I hit him. I think I just put them on alert. This is an amalgamation
[2450.04s -> 2482.14s]  of every video game. Holy shit. They didn't wait. I want to see if you can throw the rocks.
[2482.14s -> 2511.94s]  Yeah, I did. Death from above. But there's a guy right there. How would you not hear that?
[2512.74s -> 2522.25s]  What? Why would it want me to do that? Why would it want me to do that to this guy? Hey, jump on
[2522.25s -> 2538.57s]  this guy and stab him and stomp on his head. Yes. Distract them. Yes. Use a decoy to distract. Okay.
[2539.21s -> 2565.66s]  But why don't you just walk by this? What do you know? Take down. Why was it right click? What do
[2565.66s -> 2570.95s]  you mean right click is take down? What are you talking about? Right. Take down. Right click.
[2571.67s -> 2575.70s]  I just threw a rock. What? What the fuck is going on?
[2584.82s -> 2589.14s]  Why did it? It was saying right click. Right click. Right. Why right click? Right click is aimed.
[2592.38s -> 2596.78s]  All right. Press tab to open the store. Okay. Mask. The mask mode can help you analyze the
[2596.78s -> 2603.27s]  environment. A fully developed mask will highlight interactive objects. Cool. Even through walls,
[2603.27s -> 2609.13s]  it can show camera vision cones, detect sound sources, and much more. All right. That's called
[2609.13s -> 2616.22s]  mask mode. Avoiding enemy patrols on our post can be difficult. Search for the hideouts like lockers,
[2616.22s -> 2620.30s]  trash cans. To hide this is where you can wait out alarms. You can also hide bodies in these
[2620.30s -> 2627.46s]  containers. All right. So I get mask mode. I would highlight usable items and markers. All right.
[2627.46s -> 2633.78s]  Pick up weapon. Yeah. I can use this. Cool. What's this thing? I can. What's the looting even do?
[2634.82s -> 2657.61s]  What's the point of looting? It's just ammo. Okay. Cool. Why hide them when you can just throw them
[2657.61s -> 2665.11s]  over? All right. I don't even need the ammo. Wait. Easy. Mask mode. All right. We're good. What is
[2665.11s -> 2676.46s]  this? Grenades. Pick. Got it. You can only carry a limited amount so keep track of your equipment.
[2680.54s -> 2684.62s]  All right. Cool. Grenades. On. Recon the area before you proceed.
[2688.73s -> 2694.81s]  All right. We got it. What do we got? Recon out these binoculars. We've got a electricity.
[2695.45s -> 2699.77s]  Shoot that. Electrify tank. Looks like they're guarding the transformer station ahead.
[2700.57s -> 2708.78s]  Use them by different tags and appearance. I would look for the officers. Okay. I need an officer.
[2708.78s -> 2712.54s]  Looks like an officer. Search him when you're done. Copy that. All right. Wait.
[2712.54s -> 2718.25s]  All right. Regular soldiers are versatile but relatively easy to kill. Sargeants are close
[2718.25s -> 2722.97s]  combat specialists resistant to gas weapons. Riflemen specialize in assault and can use
[2722.97s -> 2727.45s]  higher class grenades. Marksmen are long-distance killers and best to eliminate heavy. So I'm going
[2727.45s -> 2736.87s]  up against like a class-based shooter. What am I? A sniper? Heavy soldiers can withstand a lot of
[2736.87s -> 2744.89s]  damage. Try to use a heavy sniper rifle on them. Just provide information. Watch out for drones.
[2745.45s -> 2748.65s]  They can expose your position. Targets and bounties are always well guarded.
[2749.37s -> 2757.19s]  Some info dump. I think the the moral of the story here is yeah like somebody just said just
[2757.19s -> 2768.10s]  shoot them. Shut up and kill them. Guys relax. All right. Let's get this guy. How come I okay
[2768.10s -> 2774.09s]  everybody talk about you. How do I know if they're an officer or not? I mean that guy looks like an
[2774.09s -> 2781.18s]  officer I guess. Shit. Keep an eye out for useful environmental elements. Fuse box. Yeah. Shoot the
[2781.18s -> 2786.63s]  fuse box. You can lure enemy to avoid combat or place where you can deal with them easily. Yeah.
[2787.27s -> 2792.57s]  If you do this you can use interactive objects like generators in few boxes or gadgets like
[2792.57s -> 2796.25s]  decoy traps or the upgraded drone. Avoiding enemy patrols and outposts can be difficult.
[2796.25s -> 2805.32s]  Hide. All right I think I got everybody tagged right. Nobody no snipers. Okay shoot fuse box.
[2805.32s -> 2811.16s]  Wait how far away is it? Not that far. Wait let me just check this. All right he's like right here.
[2811.80s -> 2831.62s]  Should I shoot this guy? No. What's he doing? How how loud is this gun? Did I get him?
[2841.80s -> 2847.56s]  Holy shit. Okay that was pretty cool. Uh now what? Wait this guy. Wait who's the officer?
[2847.56s -> 2873.86s]  That's the officer. I gotta clear this out. So um what else we got? This guy still has no idea
[2873.86s -> 2881.78s]  what's going on behind him. All right I'd have to interrogate this guy. Is this a zipline? Oh shit.
[2890.90s -> 2893.78s]  Keep your distance till they're all down. What do you mean till they're all down?
[2895.03s -> 2899.74s]  Is this like I have to interrogate this guy? Shoot this guy? I don't have to interrogate him.
[2899.74s -> 2917.30s]  Isn't that the officer? He doesn't know where I am. He just knows something's going on.
[2917.86s -> 2927.29s]  If I'm quiet can I climb this thing? I'll get around to him. Is there money in this game?
[2927.29s -> 2959.19s]  That's actually kind of fun. All right I gotta get behind him. I think I'm gonna make it. How
[2959.19s -> 2973.30s]  do I get all I gotta get all the way around him? Wait I gotta throw a stone. Did I go over the
[2973.30s -> 2993.94s]  house? Ah Mike you threw it over the house. Oh that's the only ball we had. Whip the ball like
[2993.94s -> 2998.39s]  in the backyard with your friends. You never played like just throw a ball in backyard.
[2999.03s -> 3012.46s]  All right I'm going after him. Fuck I think I just hit the fence. Sorry I'll get him here.
[3012.46s -> 3036.81s]  Interrogate. Holy shit how did he know? What? I was in the bushes. Are you serious? Oh come on. What?
[3042.01s -> 3047.93s]  Before you get there you may need a key card to access the station. I would look for the officers.
[3047.93s -> 3052.65s]  Interrogate the officer. Search him when you're done. Search him when you're done.
[3052.65s -> 3085.38s]  Fuck me. All right I'm gonna do this real damn quick. Altangos down. I have a live feed from
[3085.38s -> 3104.38s]  your mask you know. I thought he said for my mom. Die hard. He says dinner's ready. I just
[3104.38s -> 3115.18s]  don't want them to have electricity. All right let's search the uh officer. I don't take money
[3115.18s -> 3124.04s]  too right? Yeah I'm gonna loot everybody. Dude I am pogging right now so hard. Really? I appreciate
[3124.04s -> 3144.74s]  that. Did I take this guy's head off? Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. Oh I've got the key
[3144.74s -> 3151.78s]  card. Why is it giving me these wrong names? Grab body is not space. It's this mouse button.
[3152.50s -> 3170.60s]  All right let's get in. All right wait. Okay what can I do with this? Can I pick this up? Or is it
[3170.60s -> 3181.88s]  it just explodes? Power down. The fence should be harmless now. I've marked the exfil location.
[3181.88s -> 3188.12s]  Shoot it point blank. Proceed there and upload your data. Exfil location will be visible on your mask
[3188.12s -> 3197.96s]  tub if you use the scanner. Copy. I did it. What do I get? Exfiltration point. When the contract is
[3197.96s -> 3202.04s]  complete go to the exfiltration point to see the mission summary screen. From there you can stay
[3202.04s -> 3205.64s]  in the region to finish other objectives so you can leave but lose any unfinished progress.
[3206.60s -> 3230.20s]  That's it? Okay let's go. Is that person right there? No it's just a tree. I gotta get the
[3230.20s -> 3234.20s]  binoculars up in case there's any danger and any people or anything right? No people?
[3235.08s -> 3251.50s]  What am I supposed to do? A bunch of stuff here? Uh 20 community subs just came in from Ben Folds.
[3254.09s -> 3261.48s]  Thanks a lot Ben. 20. Huge sub drop. That's a big one. That's a fucking big one.
[3267.26s -> 3274.87s]  Could you be any more annoying in the sky? Dude he's pogging so hard. I am. That's a lot of money.
[3282.95s -> 3313.16s]  Two percent? Wait how? Weapons. Upgrade your gear in the loadout tab. Before each mission you
[3314.04s -> 3319.78s]  visit development section of the loadout tab. You can upgrade your mask suit gadgets and recon.
[3322.23s -> 3326.31s]  The first upgrades only cost cash but more advanced ones require
[3326.31s -> 3339.26s]  tokens. Don't tell me I have to buy these. Better not be. Okay shop screen,
[3339.26s -> 3341.50s]  find gadgets, attachments, weapons. We can look at that later.
[3343.10s -> 3347.98s]  Either. Both. I'm ready. It won't matter to the people they used the weapon on.
[3347.98s -> 3354.36s]  That's not your concern. Stay focused. All right what? Maybe it's just a drill. Who's talking?
[3355.16s -> 3376.46s]  How many other? Tag him. One. He's got three. Any more? I don't see any more. Can I get three or
[3376.46s -> 3379.58s]  can I kill him? What's that? Is that an explosive? I think there might be an explosive barrel.
[3383.13s -> 3400.18s]  Nope. Oh shit. I missed. Who cares about the wind compensation and all that dumb stuff?
[3401.14s -> 3413.18s]  Just shoot him in the head. All right where am I going? Fast. I can fast travel? Is this like open
[3413.18s -> 3422.81s]  world? I'm so confused. That's travel. I'm going here. We're just gonna go up there somehow. All
[3422.81s -> 3431.91s]  right what do they got? Plus one letter grade. Give it to me. It's an opportunity. She blew it.
[3431.91s -> 3448.98s]  What can I do with gas? Oh explosion. Anybody else? No. Should I hide these guys? I feel like
[3448.98s -> 3457.80s]  I need to hide them. That's part of the game right? There's a cave on the left. We'll put
[3457.80s -> 3479.58s]  them down here. I'll loot them right right right right. Oh that's a good spot to drop right down
[3479.58s -> 3484.15s]  here right? Is anybody nobody's down here? It's just trash. Yeah it's just like trash down there.
[3484.71s -> 3501.54s]  All right no one's looking down there. Now let's get up here. Take out the binoculars and let's
[3501.54s -> 3524.15s]  scope this out. Wait you wouldn't even see the news. Where is this person? It's them politicians
[3524.15s -> 3536.94s]  am I right? That game was so fun. I can't see anybody. I think I just have to get up here.
[3537.90s -> 3561.02s]  Go play it. I'm not playing that game. Slow down. Wasn't somebody just talking? Wait where am I
[3561.02s -> 3576.17s]  hearing this? Oh fuck they're right here. I need to interrogate somebody. All right I'm gonna try
[3576.17s -> 3589.82s]  to interrogate. I'll get that guy with a snipe. Another guy right there. Snipe that guy. Oh no.
[3589.82s -> 3621.51s]  Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Rock! Wait how far away is he? 126. Compensate for the...
[3622.47s -> 3628.55s]  No that's too much compensation. He's 126. So that means he's right there.
[3629.69s -> 3638.81s]  What did I hit the rock? What am I hitting? Uh oh this is very bad. I'm freaking out. My character's
[3638.81s -> 3648.30s]  freaking out. Slow down. What am I? I'm not hitting his head. Am I hitting this guy in the face?
[3654.66s -> 3666.84s]  What he has a mask that blocks my bullets? Oh shit there's a tank. I think the tank just ran
[3666.84s -> 3678.65s]  him over. Where is that guy looking? Is somebody alive? Is he shooting on the ground? He's shooting
[3678.65s -> 3713.59s]  in the air. I'll get him. Whoa! I have to interrogate someone. What is that? Did they find me? I'm trying
[3713.59s -> 3742.76s]  to shoot it. Just being followed around by drones. Peek out. Fuck the wind. I didn't... I forgot about
[3742.76s -> 3785.21s]  the wind. They know. Everybody knows. Oh my feet. Right in this guy's head. All right I'm gonna move
[3785.21s -> 3802.47s]  position. Can I take the drone? Nothing even in here. This is actually a pretty good spot to snipe.
[3803.19s -> 3813.05s]  They still know where I am. Hello?
[3813.05s -> 3814.89s]  Hello?
[3820.49s -> 3832.71s]  Is it a drone? It's a fucking drone. It's a drone. Where? Where's the drone? Where is it?
[3832.71s -> 3879.29s]  Where is this thing? Behind me? No it's not. Wait is that a guy? No. God damn it.
[3882.25s -> 3896.71s]  There's a lot of people here. I need to tag this guy. I need to know how far away he is.
[3897.35s -> 3909.21s]  Play it right. All right. He is... What? Oh no. Oh shit. Oh we both did the same thing. We got him.
[3914.94s -> 3921.58s]  Why would you look at me with binoculars? Who is it? Who's shooting? Who's a grenade? Did I throw
[3921.58s -> 3954.84s]  a grenade? Where's the grenade? Is there a grenade here? Where is it? Where you at? I'm gonna blow
[3954.84s -> 3974.55s]  this guy up with the explosive. I'll lure him out. I fucking can't believe I missed. Did I kill him?
[3975.19s -> 3985.38s]  I need a better place to... How many people are in this compound?
[3986.10s -> 4004.62s]  There's still this many people that I have to... That was insane. All right. Damn it. They're getting
[4004.62s -> 4014.17s]  in the tank. Oh no. He's aiming at the tank over here. I didn't... Wait are they leaving?
[4015.69s -> 4027.50s]  Where are they taking this? Where are you going? You're not gonna drive into me, right? What are you
[4027.50s -> 4059.14s]  doing? Oh move move move move. How do I heal? Lie down. Yes. Oh fuck. Okay I need to throw a
[4059.14s -> 4070.65s]  grenade at this guy. It's G right? Oh my god I'm dead. Don't stand the fuck up. I'm trying to... How
[4070.65s -> 4118.86s]  do you... Oh my god. Was it like J? B. I'm going in. I'm fucking doing it this time. Remember special
[4118.86s -> 4130.81s]  ammo? I don't think I have any special ammo. Okay so don't get spotted. These guys come back here.
[4131.45s -> 4134.17s]  I'm gonna try to shoot him through. I'm gonna try to shoot him in the head through his friend.
[4134.89s -> 4145.80s]  Well that was fucking pretty cool. All right. I'm doing this slow because I don't want to...
[4145.80s -> 4175.90s]  There's like 30 or 40 people in here. Get in there. What was that? I heard a beep. I wish I could
[4175.90s -> 4188.92s]  save it. So now is the task here to just get in there? Find the client's spy? That's... I think
[4189.24s -> 4196.26s]  you just do whatever you want. I don't think there's a set mission here. I think I just do
[4196.26s -> 4214.22s]  whatever I want. So download the plans is this one and it's in here somewhere. Download dusk.
[4215.18s -> 4227.93s]  I already have dusk downloaded. I just tried to... I tried to prone and I apparently... My body
[4227.93s -> 4234.57s]  was too far over the edge that proning actually... I lied forward and fell face down forward into the
[4234.57s -> 4256.97s]  ground. Let me get... I want to get a better spot. All right. This is not bad. Okay. I see 269 meters
[4256.97s -> 4267.11s]  to the flag and to the supported stance. Oh shit. Okay. This is not good. Where does it go?
[4267.91s -> 4271.19s]  How many people are here? I need to do some tagging. Like I've got it. I have to.
[4272.15s -> 4280.52s]  How do I get off? Is he coming up this way? This is never gonna happen unless I tag everybody.
[4289.85s -> 4294.84s]  All right. Who else is left? Guy up top. That guy's dead. I can kill that guy but
[4295.64s -> 4298.09s]  I just don't want to be spotted.
[4305.29s -> 4311.85s]  All right. Secure the package. Let's get the guy. We're gonna go top down, right? We're gonna kill
[4311.85s -> 4324.14s]  guys on roof. I'm gonna kill. Don't worry. Guys on roof first. There's only two. Supported stance.
[4324.14s -> 4329.53s]  Get it in there. These guys are 117 meters away which means that it's got to be somewhere around
[4329.53s -> 4335.29s]  right there. We'll be right in the head. Right there. I'm gonna wait until there's an opportunity.
[4335.93s -> 4363.06s]  Didn't tag that guy. Jesus. Okay. Nobody saw that, right? I feel like I would hear that.
[4363.06s -> 4368.36s]  I feel like I would hear that guy's watermelon head exploding. That was just like
[4368.36s -> 4379.42s]  exploding watermelon. I feel like I could hear that. 139. Somebody's gonna come out this door,
[4379.42s -> 4396.52s]  aren't they? Whatever. Let's go. Didn't the guy go in here? I think somebody went in here.
[4397.24s -> 4409.54s]  All right. Who's next? We've got two guys here. One, two there. A bunch of people over on the
[4409.54s -> 4416.78s]  right side. I can't kill these guys yet. I think I have to change position. I gotta get these guys
[4416.78s -> 4435.35s]  over here. All right. Changing position. Chat's getting restless. Turn your camera on. I don't
[4435.35s -> 4443.34s]  have any clothes on. I've been especially naked these last few days so now no face cam. All right.
[4443.34s -> 4454.74s]  Let's get a good shot over here. Right there. What do you think over here? I think so. I've got a
[4454.74s -> 4464.55s]  guy right there inside that building. This is getting intense. I'm like feeling this right now.
[4465.19s -> 4472.20s]  What about any others over here? No, I don't see anybody. Moving in.
[4477.74s -> 4482.14s]  Come on. I've got to keep that. I got to keep that type of like language up. You know what I
[4482.14s -> 4493.05s]  mean? Like moving in. Spotted. Top bunker. I see two. Two people. Gonna go for a collab. Because
[4493.05s -> 4500.82s]  like otherwise I'm gonna lose you guys. Check this out. Right here. I'm gonna get a collateral.
[4500.82s -> 4528.92s]  How far away are these guys? 40 meters. It's gonna go through. One, two. Get it. Did I miss anybody?
[4529.64s -> 4534.86s]  Heavy weapons guy coming over here. I don't think there's anybody else this way. I'm gonna stay
[4534.86s -> 4541.26s]  here though because there's this guy right here and then there's that guy right. Okay.
[4541.26s -> 4547.78s]  It's time to start clearing. Ready? No, not yet. Can I get them both? I'm going for it.
[4547.78s -> 4591.85s]  Fuck it. I'm going for it. Why is this guy fucking cemented? Yes. There's a guy right here.
[4597.08s -> 4602.33s]  I haven't been alerted yet. Gas canister right there. No, I don't want to alert the whole entire
[4602.33s -> 4642.92s]  compound. Wait, not because I'm not zoomed in. You see me? Almost fucking break. Where is this
[4642.92s -> 4646.92s]  guy? He's still hiding. That's a cardboard box. I can't shoot through a cardboard box.
[4647.88s -> 4669.08s]  I can, but why did it not kill him? I think everyone's dead. At least the ones that I need
[4669.08s -> 4674.92s]  to kill are dead. There's one guy right here hiding behind a cardboard, an impenetrable cardboard box.
[4675.72s -> 4683.37s]  He's not moving. He's just going to stay there. Okay. Just stay there. Don't move. Why would you
[4683.37s -> 4705.40s]  move? Climb this part. You think that you would patch this wall? This is... I can just go in here.
[4718.71s -> 4729.94s]  Didn't see that guy. Take the pistol out? No, no, no, no. There's two guys right here. I wonder if
[4729.94s -> 4740.34s]  I can interrogate one of them. Is that walking or is that the fire? Oh, fuck. He's right there.
[4741.14s -> 4746.92s]  Holy. Did he actually turn around and look? Why is he just pivoting back and forth, back and forth?
[4746.92s -> 4796.33s]  He's looking at every exit. B. B. G. Why am I not healing? Why am I not healing? B. G. T. D. F.
[4796.89s -> 4822.63s]  Okay, it's F. That guy popped out like an old light gun game. Am I good? All right, let's deal
[4822.71s -> 4836.28s]  plans. It plays a sniper game and kills people every moment with an assault rifle. Uh, you mean
[4836.28s -> 4842.04s]  three people. I killed like 15 with the sniper rifle. So what? Like I was at an eight percentile
[4842.04s -> 4847.24s]  of shooting with the with the standard shooting weapons. It was like four. It was not more than
[4847.24s -> 4851.56s]  four. I killed like 20 people with the... All right, let's go. Where's this thing over here?
[4852.36s -> 4868.33s]  In the bunker? No scope with the sniper. I don't think you can. No, you can't. I would have done it
[4868.33s -> 4895.50s]  like three times already. Okay, easy. What's in here? I don't see any people. Stay on the tube.
[4896.22s -> 4916.25s]  Never mind. Do you see anybody? There ain't nobody here, Ryan. What up here? There's nobody in the
[4916.25s -> 4943.22s]  nest. That's odd. I just... Okay, that was like a chimpanzee in a tree. Do you see anybody? There's
[4943.22s -> 4955.74s]  like a camp over here. I'm freezing to death. Get out. Get out of the ice.
[4961.69s -> 4977.27s]  It's right here. What am I looking for? A document? Why would there be a document all the way back
[4977.27s -> 5040.34s]  here? All right. Why was there a waypoint here? Why was there a custom waypoint?
[5052.06s -> 5091.70s]  Where was I? Over... Oh my god. I put it there. God damn it. Can I climb back up this thing? Yeah,
[5091.70s -> 5108.55s]  right here. I'm good. You can't climb this? Yes, you can. Don't tell me you can't climb this. It's
[5108.55s -> 5140.82s]  literally squares. What the fuck just happened? I'm just going this way, I guess. Sorry, I have to
[5140.82s -> 5166.17s]  use my fucking hacker stripy silly string vision. Okay. Now, what am I looking for? I download the
[5166.17s -> 5182.62s]  plans. So there's a computer in here. Where's the computer? I gotta find a computer room.
[5188.55s -> 5203.50s]  All right. Computer in here. That's I mean, that's a computer. There's multiple computers in here.
[5203.50s -> 5209.86s]  There's a lot of computers in this room, but I don't think it's one of these computers.
[5219.46s -> 5238.14s]  Let's try this one. Computer. Nice name. What are you guys doing? Stop. Stop it at once. Okay,
[5238.14s -> 5260.30s]  it's not in here. Try one of the other buildings. This one. This place is just trashed. It's probably
[5260.30s -> 5293.51s]  up here. Let me look. Use the silly string vision to find the laptop. It's the laptop.
[5294.07s -> 5320.39s]  Is this a computer? No. All right. Found it. Hack it. And 17,000 dollars. I can exfiltrate.
[5322.74s -> 5334.66s]  So you exfil. All right. So you do a random mission on the map. And then you exfiltrate. So
[5335.46s -> 5347.14s]  exfiltrate. And then you do it again. I gotta kill the I can't move on from this game until
[5347.14s -> 5354.41s]  I kill the guy in this map. I have to kill the dude that came. I can't just not do that.
[5355.37s -> 5369.22s]  All right. Extraction point. Let's get it. This is gonna hurt. That almost killed me.
[5369.94s -> 5374.39s]  I could jump from there and be fine. Guaranteed. There's more than one.
[5375.19s -> 5396.42s]  Uh, let's go to this one. Pulling the wall over here. Yeah, I did it. Jump off the roof of your
[5396.42s -> 5411.91s]  house right now and prove it. It wasn't that high. All right. So I want to get how do I get out of
[5411.91s -> 5422.36s]  here? I want to go to the I want to buy stuff. All right. Where's it? Eliminate him over here.
[5422.36s -> 5432.02s]  Let's go. I'm going in. Why is it red? I'm going in. I'm gonna I'm going I'm going for the main
[5432.02s -> 5450.49s]  I'm going for the main contract. Let's go. Nobody down here. This is the way I need to go.
[5456.01s -> 5469.21s]  Elite sniper has to buy own gear. How do you think they get this stuff? I'm supposed to be
[5469.21s -> 5477.00s]  like a mercenary. Can you sleep for 32 weeks in this game? I feel like a lot of you are already
[5477.00s -> 5510.57s]  doing that. Yeah, I don't need to. Is he dead? Not good enough. You're gonna tell me where they are.
[5512.44s -> 5519.98s]  That way. Over at the base where all the people are. Idiot. Thanks for the info.
[5534.28s -> 5539.93s]  Found you. He's 75 meters away. Therefore, we're right there. Don't even need to zoom it in. Let's
[5539.93s -> 5555.00s]  get it. One, two, three. That's a super bullet. Should I not use this? Uh, I don't want this thing.
[5555.64s -> 5570.15s]  I only have four shots left. No, this thing. I don't want this thing. Use your pistol. Yeah,
[5570.15s -> 5574.07s]  this thing is better. It's not better, but you know. All right, let me keep going.
[5578.01s -> 5592.47s]  Oh, something in there. Might be a ammunition in here. This would be a pretty cool puzzle game.
[5596.76s -> 5609.00s]  I have to decide which one of these turns on which vent. Diaper check. That's pretty good.
[5612.46s -> 5619.18s]  This is your first stream. What would you think about the diaper check command? That's not real.
[5622.23s -> 5625.43s]  You wouldn't think I was a weirdo. You just think everyone here was a fucking weirdo.
[5625.43s -> 5630.78s]  All right, am I going the right way? No, I gotta go over there.
[5631.58s -> 5638.31s]  Because all I even okay, it doesn't matter if I've said any of this shit before.
[5638.31s -> 5642.95s]  If someone is a brand new viewer, I can be like, what is diaper check? What the fuck are you guys
[5642.95s -> 5648.79s]  doing? Relax. And a new viewer will go, okay, he has nothing to do with that. What are you guys
[5648.79s -> 5655.48s]  doing? Yeah, what's wrong with you guys? Even though it's all my fault. That's like kind of,
[5655.48s -> 5670.47s]  I mean, it's kind of interesting, I guess. Diaper check is funny and then a bunch of swears.
[5681.77s -> 5685.45s]  It seems that a lot of people want Ivanowski dead. All right, here we go. Which one are we
[5685.45s -> 5691.70s]  working for? Paying. Does it matter who or what they are? Individual, corporation, or government?
[5692.26s -> 5700.31s]  No, I'm a bounty hunter. Take out. All right, here we go. Let's make this happen. Guy up here.
[5702.54s -> 5709.26s]  Anybody on the other areas where there's only one person guarding this whole entire community,
[5709.26s -> 5714.86s]  I guess, wherever this is. All right, here we go. How far were you 37 meters away, which means just
[5716.38s -> 5730.87s]  Yeah, I got it. All right, they got the bad guys in here. Just a question of where
[5731.43s -> 5743.66s]  can you interrogate the bad guy? Now, I know I'm saying the bad guy, because that's just how you
[5743.74s -> 5749.08s]  generally phrase everybody that you're fighting in anything. Get those bad guys.
[5750.76s -> 5779.98s]  It's not bad guys. It's bad guys. It's its own term. It's also a way to explain to anybody
[5781.67s -> 5786.07s]  that like what you're doing is just you're playing a video game. That's the best just
[5786.95s -> 5790.47s]  Oh, what what do you do? Why did you just do that? Why'd you shoot that guy? Ah, he's a bad guy.
[5791.27s -> 5795.35s]  You want me to go off to the nuanced explanation as to what all these people are and what they're
[5795.35s -> 5807.99s]  all doing here? Well, that's how you tell your mom what you're doing. Oh, get get that guy. Get
[5807.99s -> 5826.49s]  that guy right there. Get that bad guy. I'll get him. Mom does not want lore. Mom does not want
[5826.49s -> 5848.50s]  lore. Mom wants to know make sure you're not doing drugs. I heard voices. He's in here somewhere.
[5853.72s -> 5862.50s]  Wait, am I gonna get an opportunity to go up? What was that? Are we being attacked? Are we under
[5862.50s -> 5875.51s]  attack? I think we're under attack. All right, we're under attack. Where do I go? We're under
[5875.51s -> 5898.52s]  attack. What is that for? Is it me? What's that? Camera? Oh, I've been spotted on camera. Where's
[5898.52s -> 5929.96s]  the camera? Son of a gun. Well, he's in here somewhere. He's probably in there. Mom is angry.
[5931.53s -> 5937.10s]  What do you mean mom? Interrogation. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. I'm being aimed at by who?
[5937.10s -> 5944.01s]  Somebody's over there. Who? Who is it? Where are they? Where are they? Where are they?
[5944.57s -> 5970.09s]  Do you guys see anybody? I want to interrogate this guy. Oh, fuck. How did I? Great. How did
[5970.09s -> 5985.99s]  that guy not? The target is running. Target is running. Target's running. Where is he? Where is
[5985.99s -> 5996.74s]  he? Okay, I'm gonna go this way. Where is he? I don't see him anywhere. The target can see me,
[5997.82s -> 6010.07s]  but what? Where is he? Is he looking at a camera? He's on his laptop. Is that him?
[6010.71s -> 6032.38s]  I haven't seen that shot before. Right through the lens. Yep. You never see that shit. All right,
[6032.38s -> 6068.20s]  where's the target? What the fuck was that? Imagine hard scoping. Is he trying to pick up the guy's
[6068.20s -> 6097.86s]  gun? Oh, no. Oh, no. Reload. Oh, that guy's got a mask on.
[6122.98s -> 6130.28s]  Are you sure it's not the full five straight minutes of here comes the nuke alarm?
[6131.40s -> 6141.16s]  It might have something to do with that. And the noise of gunfire. Got a grenade?
[6141.80s -> 6157.16s]  Where is he? Somebody's right. Did you see that? I got a camera view of somebody else hiding over
[6157.16s -> 6163.70s]  there. Did you see that? Where is he? He's like right there. The camera went by him. He was hiding
[6163.70s -> 6188.86s]  behind a wall. Where was he? There's a lot of money here. I can hear him talking. Is he underneath?
[6189.66s -> 6199.42s]  There's too many dead bodies on the ground. I can't see. All right, let's go.
[6223.91s -> 6231.72s]  I need to find the guy that I was supposed to... I'm just going to accidentally come across this
[6231.72s -> 6247.88s]  guy, aren't I? Sniper, by the way. Yeah, well, this game wants me to infiltrate and stealth kill
[6247.88s -> 6262.31s]  people close and far. This shouldn't be called Sniper Contracts. What just happened in there?
[6262.31s -> 6273.77s]  I got him. That was him. He's in a hazmat suit. Oh, there's this gas. All right, I gotta get out
[6274.33s -> 6305.80s]  I gotta get out. This game shouldn't be... All right, I'm leaving. Who? All right, out. I got him.
[6312.97s -> 6319.13s]  Wait, let me just get one more kill really far away. I want like at least 200-300 meters like this.
[6320.95s -> 6321.83s]  Damn it, I had it.
[6337.29s -> 6342.82s]  There's no way you're gonna get more paid contracts after this. I did it.
[6343.78s -> 6345.88s]  Did you hear the guy in the tutorial?
[6350.41s -> 6351.37s]  He said something like that.
[6358.26s -> 6362.82s]  That's what he said. The guy that's in my ear said something like that.
[6372.63s -> 6384.76s]  They're waiting for me. All right, time to bring out the assault rifle because there's gonna be
[6384.76s -> 6399.64s]  like another person here and I'm gonna get the fucking insta-killed. Uploading data. Guy in hazmat
[6399.64s -> 6409.96s]  suit. I don't know where he was or what happened but the room he was in exploded. I just aimed
[6411.96s -> 6417.48s]  down a hallway and held the button down and like five people exploded. I guess one of them was in.
[6418.04s -> 6429.85s]  There's more to do here. What's the... Destroy all test results. Steal samples of the virus.
[6433.13s -> 6439.21s]  Find the client's spy. I'm not... I kind of... This is... It's not like it just said in all capitals,
[6439.21s -> 6446.20s]  this sucks, but I mean just wait. Let me continue playing up close and far away.
[6447.56s -> 6465.66s]  Did I shoot myself in the head with the gun? You should move on to hand simulator.
[6466.54s -> 6478.81s]  What do you mean bounty active? I just got him. Oh, that's the spy. Okay. All right, let's go.
[6479.61s -> 6509.42s]  Damn it. I need... All right, let's go. Bounty update. Find the spy. Who gives a shit about...
[6509.42s -> 6515.82s]  I mean, this is up close. Up close is more important sometimes. Why are the two not here anymore?
[6515.82s -> 6538.87s]  I got eyes. Bounty active. Entering bounty area. Who's the bounty? Is it this guy? I mean,
[6538.87s -> 6608.18s]  there's like a lot of smoke over here. Damn it. I saw his face. Come on. Right, I bet he... He could
[6608.18s -> 6616.28s]  hear that bullet. Almost out of ammo. Without the sniper rifle, this is just an FPS game.
[6617.61s -> 6623.98s]  Yeah, I mean it is. I mean, it's just like a... It's an open-ended just run around and...
[6625.54s -> 6629.38s]  Holy shit, that guy was blending and smoking a cigarette. That guy was... I didn't even know
[6629.38s -> 6654.44s]  he existed. I mean, okay, here's one takeaway. It's kind of cool that there's just... It's an
[6654.44s -> 6658.28s]  open-ended game where you just can walk around and do whatever you want. There's no missions.
[6659.00s -> 6662.44s]  It's just... Here's all the things that we want you to do here. Go do it somehow.
[6663.40s -> 6673.50s]  I guess that's kind of cool. But I don't even think I... I mean, leaving the bounty area. Where?
[6675.02s -> 6704.41s]  That was... Yeah, that was poor timing. I know. I'm dead. Yeah, all right. It's like, here's a
[6704.41s -> 6707.93s]  sniper, but no run through this place where there's a bunch of people walking around and shoot them
[6707.93s -> 6712.33s]  with the gun. Sniper, but it's a sniper game. But don't use your sniper. Well, you should be
[6712.41s -> 6717.85s]  using your sniper, but recon, but don't recon. Stealth, but don't stealth. Be far away. Be close.
[6729.18s -> 6734.84s]  I guess you can just do it any way you want. That's kind of the point, isn't it? All right,
[6734.84s -> 6755.21s]  this is gonna be tricky. Here on a Star Wars planet. Another one? Wait, Captain what? Captain Ivan...
[6756.01s -> 6763.61s]  That's him! That's the guy! I have to kill that guy. Did I actually miss that? I went through his...
[6764.41s -> 6785.91s]  Where is he? He has a grenade in his hand. I don't need to go any further. Let's go
[6787.27s -> 6805.50s]  find the spy. Let's move. All right, let's get in there. Wait, I can do a super... I can do a kill
[6805.50s -> 6817.59s]  thing, right? That worth more points? This is a shotgun. Like, why would you give a guy a shotgun
[6817.59s -> 6837.54s]  and a sniper? Like, I want to use this right now. Okay, in here, I gotta find the spy, then use it.
[6838.34s -> 6841.70s]  I already got the bounty. What do you mean, leaving the bounty area? Wait, do I have to like, prove it?
[6848.18s -> 6854.26s]  Did I already get that guy? I already killed him. I don't think I care. I already killed the guy.
[6861.37s -> 6895.77s]  I apparently failed the bounty. Where is he? He's in the trees. Where the fuck is he?
[6896.81s -> 6907.85s]  Now, this is what I call... That's a... I deserve at least a hundred pop champs for that one.
[6907.85s -> 6952.46s]  Dude, why do I have to take off their shell? I'm so confused. He's hiding? He's not firing at me.
[6966.31s -> 6995.61s]  Oh my god! I don't need to heal yet. I have to go this way, so... He's the same... I can't even see
[6995.61s -> 7010.39s]  through the tree. I'm throwing a grenade over there. Sometimes you have to do it. I'm out of ammo.
[7011.03s -> 7020.34s]  What's with the enemies always narrating their actions? Why can't they just stealth grenade or
[7020.34s -> 7030.20s]  stealth reload? You know, that is true, but I guess it's to tell everybody that you're...
[7030.92s -> 7040.07s]  Hey, I'm in trouble, or I'm... Somebody cover me, or... All right, only four shots in the sniper rifle.
[7040.07s -> 7064.20s]  All right, I gotta find the spy. Hey, German, this is Matthew. We've seen that copypasta so
[7064.20s -> 7075.26s]  many times now. I can't see shit. You gotta take their hard shell off and then shoot him in the face.
[7076.28s -> 7084.50s]  Uh-oh, to the right. There's a whole encampment over there. All right, am I still in the zone?
[7084.50s -> 7100.92s]  Not really. He's over here. Two bullets. That's it. Don't fall down there. What the hell is this guy?
[7101.72s -> 7109.54s]  He's like either in here or he's this way. Is there a building over here? There's a little camp up
[7109.54s -> 7116.58s]  there. That's where I just was. Wait, slow down. That's a bright light. Is there a tank?
[7123.16s -> 7136.47s]  Uh, I don't know what that is. No. I found the agent. He's dead. Retrieve any lab samples he was
[7136.47s -> 7146.38s]  carrying. Here, lab samples. I cannot find any samples. I am disappointed, seeker. Did that take
[7146.38s -> 7151.66s]  too long? I've marked safe exit points on your map. Should you choose to exfiltrate now?
[7153.18s -> 7195.70s]  I gotta spend some money, guys. That was not ideal, I know. Wait, I need to... I need health and ammo
[7195.70s -> 7203.08s]  and shit. Don't kill them. What do you mean don't kill? This is a game about killing people.
[7207.67s -> 7224.39s]  Don't kill them. What would you like me to do? Just run by them? Oh, there is no knockout. Bounty
[7224.39s -> 7236.20s]  active. All right, I gotta... I'm going... I want to go in and buy something. I feel like I've been
[7236.20s -> 7239.56s]  stuck on the first mission. I'm just doing the first mission. I'm doing everything in the first
[7239.56s -> 7263.96s]  map. We've been on snow level for two hours. All right, how do I just leave? I kind of don't want
[7263.96s -> 7277.66s]  to do that, though. Destroy all the test results? Steal samples? All right, main menu. Yeah, let's
[7277.66s -> 7289.02s]  go to... Remember the loadout screen? Isn't there a loadout? Contracts. I guess I'm just on this.
[7289.66s -> 7302.63s]  You just have to do this one. Loadout. There we go. Loadout. I have $163,000. Look at... Okay,
[7302.63s -> 7308.66s]  this is what I should have done from the very beginning. Damage, firing rate, stability,
[7309.86s -> 7315.56s]  noise reduction, so that people hear this shit. People hear this really... It's very loud.
[7315.56s -> 7323.30s]  I want the most expensive one. It's this one. Preferred range. I'm gonna sneeze. I'm sorry.
[7324.02s -> 7333.75s]  I caught it. I want... This one's in tons of damage, but why do I care about that?
[7335.62s -> 7342.23s]  I want complete noise reduction. This one here. All right, that... This is... How is this bad?
[7343.80s -> 7347.32s]  More damage, more fire rate, more stability, more damage reduction. Oh, a little bit less
[7347.32s -> 7369.19s]  mobility. Who cares? Oh. Well, I need tokens. Mobility, firing rate, stability. I'll try this
[7369.19s -> 7372.71s]  one. It's loud, but I mean, it's got better stability, more fire rate, and I can move around
[7373.03s -> 7377.82s]  and snipe. All right, I bought it. Now what? Can I do anything else with it?
[7378.62s -> 7387.51s]  Developing. There's a skill tree. Mask. How many points do I need? $25,000.
[7391.61s -> 7398.52s]  Oh, I can make... I can get the turret. No, I can't. Suit. Stamina regenerates faster,
[7398.52s -> 7406.57s]  adds Kevlar armor layer to the current armor. You're harder to detect. I want to go to that
[7406.57s -> 7416.04s]  level. I don't want to be in the snow level. This level looks cool. Turret. Increases remote
[7416.04s -> 7423.74s]  sniper turret fire range. That's not... I need to, like, get the turret. Okay, secondary weapon.
[7427.29s -> 7436.14s]  I want this to be heavy, heavy damage. I don't care about noise. I mean, this is... I already
[7436.14s -> 7447.48s]  have it on. What was the sidearm? Ooh, magnum. Fire rate, mobility, ammo capacity. I like this.
[7447.48s -> 7456.22s]  That's too much. I can't buy it. I'm getting the magnum. All right, med kit, fire grenade,
[7456.22s -> 7470.94s]  and then turret. Where's the turret? I need challenge tokens. God damn it. Warning device?
[7471.90s -> 7487.18s]  This is a cool ad. What do you mean, ad? I'm just trying to pick weapons. I can't do the
[7487.18s -> 7495.35s]  turret, guys. Unfortunate. Let's go to development. I'm going to do, uh, more, yep, detection.
[7496.31s -> 7511.40s]  Hard to detect. Uh, more armor. Uh, more sniper ammo. Yep. Uh, okay. Okay. All right, I just
[7511.40s -> 7532.82s]  got to... You're in the middle of another mission. I don't understand.
[7532.82s -> 7552.63s]  I already did this. I just said continue. I said continue. Do I just do this again?
[7557.93s -> 7561.77s]  No, I already... I already have everything. All right, let's try fast traveling.
[7563.08s -> 7570.97s]  Fast travel to here. What else do I need in order to play the next game?
[7570.97s -> 7590.41s]  Um, 500 million dollars and I'll switch. Let me try my new rifle. Oh, let's go. We can do it.
[7590.41s -> 7598.30s]  We can hit it. All right, the next time I die, well, I'm just going to play Dusk. I mean,
[7598.30s -> 7602.62s]  the game's, it's all, it's pretty fun. It's all right. I wouldn't say this is like my favorite
[7602.62s -> 7617.69s]  game ever, but I'm still interested. Dude, people think I lose interest in a video game real quick.
[7618.49s -> 7635.93s]  Yeah, here's the thing. What if I don't die? All right. Steal the data. Steal samples of the virus.
[7635.93s -> 7642.42s]  I'm going to steal the samples of the virus. Steal the samples. All right. There's like a package
[7642.42s -> 7653.72s]  in here for me. Where is it? Public media. I got 4,500 bucks for collecting that collectible.
[7654.28s -> 7665.06s]  So I just need to get back in here and steal the plans. All right. Fine. I won't even play
[7665.06s -> 7756.65s]  with the sniper. Fine. All right. I was gonna... I'm fine. Oh, shit. Sample. Where's this damp sample?
[7757.61s -> 7796.76s]  There's no, that's not a sample. Give me a sample. I need, where are the samples? Sample? That looks
[7796.76s -> 7827.82s]  like a sample. May days? This little fucking lunchbox is the sample. Are you kidding me?
[7837.85s -> 7902.70s]  Fine. Avoid combat. Good luck. Extraction point. Jump the fence. Jump the fence. If I die,
[7902.70s -> 7915.29s]  game turns off. I'm trying. I'm playing like full on FPS game right now.
[7916.09s -> 7955.66s]  Where is he? I'm going to finish the rest of this fucking level without dying.
[7957.42s -> 7979.02s]  That better be a pog. 32% completion. Let's go back up there. I'm going. Who cares? Just go.
[7979.91s -> 7995.58s]  I think I can do it. I think I can do it. I'm just going to play like this. Just check this up.
[7996.30s -> 8005.62s]  Up here. I don't need to fast travel. We got to go up here. We got to destroy the test results.
[8005.62s -> 8013.59s]  You got it. I'm getting myself ready for dusk. Dusk is all about like spin,
[8013.59s -> 8016.31s]  shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, twist, twist, twist, twist, twist, turn, twist, turn, turn,
[8016.31s -> 8055.86s]  twist, turn, shoot. I would have had it. All right. Only a hundred miles, a hundred meters.
[8056.58s -> 8080.65s]  It just took forever to reload that. God damn it, man. Really? It's not.
[8110.94s -> 8146.22s]  Find another way in this way. Attention span here. It's like I know where I'm going.
[8146.22s -> 8170.07s]  Okay. Fuck. I was doing so well too and I'm just going too fast. Whatever. Who fucking cares?
[8170.87s -> 8186.25s]  I wish I could play the other levels. It's almost like this game wants you to have this drop in,
[8186.25s -> 8201.38s]  drop out sort of mentality, but you have to stay here until when? Do I have to do all the major
[8201.38s -> 8207.98s]  objectives before I can do anything else? All right. Let's play dusk. I've never played dusk.
[8207.98s -> 8209.98s]  I have no idea what happened. It's probably going to be fun.
[8213.16s -> 8241.56s]  Let's just do dusk. Okay. Is this game good? Okay. You're going to get mad. Am I?
