[0.31s -> 8.15s]  I want to read this one. Viva Pinata ran its course. Resident sleeper Drew Crew is out in full force.
[8.15s -> 17.27s]  Oh, so we didn't run Drew Crew's course with like five streams and like 17 hours of gameplay?
[17.27s -> 29.90s]  I think you- I think you're holding on to something there. It's been like three and a half hours of
[29.90s -> 41.94s]  Viva Pinata. Do you guys act like I've streamed this game for the last like four years straight?
[41.94s -> 51.50s]  Holy shit, Viva Pinata. It's been 75 hours of this game straight. I played it yesterday for like
[51.50s -> 74.81s]  three hours. I need to check on my animals and that's what we're gonna do. Check on your animal
[74.81s -> 86.71s]  crossing village. I can't. It's not here. I got- my girlfriend needs something. I gotta have something
[86.71s -> 93.88s]  to do. She's playing animal crossing. I'm playing my version of animal crossing which is animal
[93.88s -> 106.06s]  related and it's called Viva Pinata out of control. What am I supposed to name the game?
[106.06s -> 120.92s]  Trouble in paradise. That's the one. It's the animal crossing wannabe. They both came out the
[120.92s -> 129.18s]  same time. I'm opening it up. We're going. This is what I want to play. This is what we're gonna play.
[129.18s -> 142.68s]  Where's my headphones? What the fuck happened? Where are my headphones? Why am- why are my
[142.68s -> 150.20s]  headphones not in this room? Wait, they were connected yesterday. What? Hold on a second.
[150.20s -> 160.49s]  Why are my headphones not here? What the fuck? I didn't take them out of here. This doesn't make
[160.49s -> 171.13s]  any sense. I got them. They were wrapped up in the bottom of the chair. Okay, we're good.
[172.62s -> 186.62s]  No, it wasn't Kim. It wasn't Kim. All right, I got them. We're good. Imagine that. All right,
[186.62s -> 201.26s]  here we go. Did we just get bits? We did. We did right now. Very nice. Gave 20 dollars in bits.
[201.26s -> 210.52s]  Can you guys even hear this? Yeah, you can't hear. 20 bucks in bits. 2,000. Love you,
[210.52s -> 215.82s]  German. Always stay safe, bro. That's been very nice. Well, I think that's very nice. So,
[216.46s -> 227.99s]  thank you. Don't mind me just passing through. All right, what were we doing? I wanted to get-
[227.99s -> 235.26s]  Okay, here we go. Oh, yes, there they are. It's been so long since I've seen you two.
[237.72s -> 257.78s]  Wouldn't they just drown? Wait, wouldn't that frog be like in- like swallowing water? Wake them up.
[257.78s -> 266.30s]  All right, so let me- okay, right, right, right. That's what I was gonna do. I got a plan. We're
[266.30s -> 274.78s]  gonna get cats. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Cats eat mice. Mice have sex. Mice make more mice.
[275.58s -> 283.93s]  Feed cats. Cats have sex. What do cats need? We'll find out maybe eventually here. Okay,
[283.93s -> 295.69s]  give me my shovel. I need crabs too. Wait. All right, send that person off in a cannon. I'll
[295.69s -> 300.25s]  level up if I do this, right? Yeah. Anyways, I didn't do an intro. Hey, guys. Welcome to the
[300.25s -> 322.06s]  stream. Fucking cool. Where's that? Where's the cannon box? That was lame. Do it again.
[322.06s -> 330.15s]  No, I already did my intro. I don't know. This isn't like 2012. I don't need to be like, hey,
[330.71s -> 343.90s]  what's going on, everybody? It's Jerma here with another stream. No, where- this is 2020.
[343.90s -> 364.46s]  That was better. He's unprofessional. Gameplay. In that way, how come it's not shooting at all?
[364.46s -> 379.93s]  How many do I need to pack in here? Did I not pack it? I did. So why is the cannon not shooting?
[379.93s -> 386.12s]  Like my post if I'm here- if you're here from the discord. I got it. I am. Has to be a new- oh.
[386.12s -> 391.64s]  So did I just remove that person for no reason? Kind of annoying. All right, what's most- whatever
[391.64s -> 404.66s]  I want. Like my post if you're here from the discord. All right, what do you think? I'm
[404.66s -> 414.60s]  thinking sand. I'm thinking sand over this way. Yep. That looks good to me. I don't want that
[414.60s -> 421.67s]  much sand though because I- don't the snakes not like sand? Fix the noise gate on your microphone.
[421.67s -> 428.63s]  Don't worry. In like- in a week, I won't even be in the same place. We'll fix that some other
[428.95s -> 443.06s]  way. Why is the sound fucked up? I mean it seems like it's working. No, there's this-
[443.06s -> 466.63s]  like what's wrong with it? Yeah, it's working. It's working. It's fine. Do a stream from the back of
[466.63s -> 476.14s]  the moving van. Like I'm just sitting back there. Just like sit at a desk trying to like stream
[476.14s -> 484.41s]  something. What happened? Like why- why don't- why- why's my right analog not work now?
[486.98s -> 492.22s]  What the fuck? Why can I not- up and down on my analog doesn't do anything?
[492.22s -> 522.31s]  Okay. What the hell is going on? What's that? What's that mean? What's that? What's that mean?
[523.46s -> 528.66s]  Battery? Well, why can I go forward? Wait, there's no battery going to the right analog?
[531.64s -> 557.42s]  Battery going to X? What? Hold on. I do it. He's orange. Stop. I just want to play with my animals.
[559.96s -> 564.52s]  Why does the right analog not fucking work? What does this take for batteries?
[564.52s -> 581.02s]  Two double A? Got it right here. Oh, right. Okay. Oh, surgery. Surgery on stream. I didn't even
[581.02s -> 593.96s]  sedate this guy. I didn't even- I didn't even get anesthesia. Sorry. Which way does it go?
[593.96s -> 601.83s]  Which way does it go? Wait, did you take- you can't take that serial number and like fucking
[601.83s -> 615.13s]  like do anything to me, right? All right, let's- where's uh- how does it go? Wait, oh fuck!
[615.29s -> 622.84s]  God damn it, they're all the same brand! And I just dropped them. I think- wait, I don't remember.
[622.84s -> 638.33s]  I think this is it. My brand. Why are you orange? Because this fucking white balance isn't set up
[638.33s -> 660.89s]  right now. I don't know. What? Okay. L. The triggers don't work. The bumpers work. B doesn't work.
[660.97s -> 671.32s]  B doesn't work? What's going on? Those are the right batteries. Okay, up and down works. Start
[671.32s -> 683.37s]  works. B does work. So why does the right analog not work? The triggers don't work either. Hold on,
[683.37s -> 692.33s]  I gotta- I gotta restart the fucking game? Smash the controller in the closet. No, no, no. Let me-
[692.41s -> 707.24s]  Hold on. This doesn't make any sense. Controller style? What? What? What the hell?
[735.11s -> 742.82s]  Why would they do that? Why would that even be an option? Simple controls. Well, all simple
[742.82s -> 749.45s]  controls does is just remove the function of half of your controller. All right, where- okay, let's
[749.45s -> 769.42s]  go. Okay, I want to do more- I want to do more grass over here. This dude does like a dirt over
[769.42s -> 779.02s]  here. Get the crab? I'm gonna. I'm gonna. I'm trying. I'm just trying to make this look a little
[779.02s -> 793.93s]  better. I just got an expanded- I got an expanded ground. Cheeto puff controller?
[795.85s -> 799.37s]  Let's do dirt. Yeah, over to here. Getting rid of this- yeah, that's like a little beach. That's
[799.37s -> 816.54s]  fine. The snakes don't like this though. I'm gonna- let me change this. Turn the orange cam back on.
[817.50s -> 827.93s]  It's fine. No, I don't like this because you can see my fucking red eyes from like sleeping
[827.93s -> 833.85s]  two hours a night. No, I don't like that. You guys can see my like my fucking like two hours of
[833.85s -> 855.24s]  sleep eyes. You should wink. I'm not fucking winking. He's high. Please. I'm trying to make
[855.24s -> 860.12s]  this place look better. What shit are you wearing? What shit?
[863.16s -> 866.68s]  It's a Pac-Man t-shirt. Are you out of your fucking mind?
[871.80s -> 874.92s]  Look at how messed up this is. Let me plant down- it doesn't matter. I'll fix it.
[875.96s -> 880.12s]  I just don't want this to look so shitty because this looks awful.
[885.48s -> 887.40s]  Look at how much cleaner this is gonna start to look now.
[894.76s -> 899.24s]  How's David doing? I don't know. I don't know- I don't know who David is.
[900.84s -> 904.60s]  All right, that's better. We got a little pond over there. Now let's put this away.
[906.22s -> 910.70s]  Now I'd like- why are you- what are you doing? Why the fuck is she doing?
[914.06s -> 920.63s]  It's the guy you stole the Xbox from. I didn't steal any Xbox actually. This is- this was- I
[920.63s -> 926.97s]  bought it. All right, now we need a little bit more. We'll do desert over here. How do I get
[926.97s -> 938.57s]  you to get in here? Just eat one of these mice. Hurry up. Let's do desert over here. You bought a
[938.57s -> 950.46s]  stolen Xbox. I don't- I don't think that's what happened. I think I made that name.
[952.78s -> 957.66s]  I don't know why but maybe- I don't know. I did for some reason. I can't think of a reason why.
[962.54s -> 970.90s]  That's a liar. I don't know. Maybe I'll check and see what David's like play history is, right?
[972.42s -> 980.95s]  All right, that's good. All right, this is a daisy. I need some more. Look at this. It's starting
[980.95s -> 987.14s]  to come together. What's in here? What the hell is this? Oh shit, it's another- another water
[988.02s -> 996.38s]  tube. Wait, what happened to the other water tube? Did somebody eat it? Who ate it? Did somebody eat
[996.38s -> 1007.19s]  that old water tube? Oh, it's like a little lily pad. I did. Well, you fucking shouldn't have done
[1007.19s -> 1028.52s]  that. How much water can the watercress take in? Too much. Okay, so we get the- this is good.
[1029.08s -> 1034.04s]  So what does it take for a crab again? We need much more water. So I'm thinking- so we got a
[1034.04s -> 1039.05s]  little sand portion over there. We need more sand. I'm thinking another sand portion this way,
[1039.05s -> 1043.13s]  right? Because this is- we could bring the crabs in over here. That's what I'm thinking.
[1044.57s -> 1052.60s]  You're right, I shouldn't have done that. The streamer is pissed. Why am I pissed?
[1053.24s -> 1055.77s]  Is it because I'm like red?
[1061.69s -> 1073.58s]  You know what we're gonna do tomorrow? And for the next 30 to 40 straight days, this.
[1079.11s -> 1082.31s]  I'm gonna play Viva Pinata every single fucking goddamn day
[1087.77s -> 1095.14s]  the rest of my life until I'm 100. Because I'm- I'm- I'm making it to 100, okay? You know how
[1095.14s -> 1103.34s]  many green vegetables I eat on a weekly basis? Not enough. Probably like one serving a week,
[1103.34s -> 1107.26s]  which is bad. You should be- you should do like a green serving of vegetables every fucking day.
[1107.26s -> 1113.14s]  At least every other day. But now that I think about it, I'll probably- nutritionally speaking,
[1113.14s -> 1118.70s]  I'll probably make it to like 61. So that's why I gotta start now. I've got to start eating green
[1118.70s -> 1131.14s]  vegetables on every meal. Oh, seeds. When my mask gets broken, I fix it with flour and water paste.
[1131.14s -> 1139.82s]  You gotta start like 20 years ago, dude. I actually- I actually eat very well. I eat at least
[1139.82s -> 1149.06s]  one green vegetable at every meal. Can I even do this with a straight face? Oh, the trick stick.
[1149.06s -> 1162.60s]  Let's try that. Tahini- I have tahini paste at every meal. Uh, plant dried out. Didn't I just
[1162.60s -> 1168.98s]  overwater this like five fucking seconds ago? Oh, the $20- a $20 donation just came in a bit.
[1169.78s -> 1176.79s]  From Very Noise. Another one. 2,000 bits. Thanks, dude. Thank you for that. 40- that's 4,000 bits
[1176.79s -> 1186.34s]  total in the last like 10 minutes. Thank you. The Cheez-Its have made him orange. Should I fix it?
[1186.34s -> 1193.66s]  You want me to fix it so it's not orange? You want me to put like a- like a handsome filter on?
[1195.13s -> 1228.44s]  No. What? Why? Put the handsome filter on? Hold on. Wait, this is wrong. What? Hold on. Something's
[1228.44s -> 1242.31s]  wrong here. I can't get- it doesn't- it looks wrong like this and it looks wrong like this.
[1244.47s -> 1249.91s]  Okay, here we go. Right? All right, we'll put the handsome filter on here in a second.
[1273.21s -> 1276.97s]  I could- I could be- I could be anything. You can imagine the rest of my features.
[1282.38s -> 1304.46s]  See how handsome this is? What's going on? No, fuck! You know what the worst part about this is?
[1305.72s -> 1309.96s]  You know when you're watching a streamer and they have autofocus on, which by the way,
[1309.96s -> 1314.04s]  you want a streamer tip, turn autofocus off because what happens is it gets like this
[1314.04s -> 1319.98s]  and they don't even know it's like that and the camera is fucking struggling so hard to just-
[1320.54s -> 1324.54s]  please refocus it and it could be like this for about two to three straight minutes.
[1324.54s -> 1336.04s]  But we're going to keep it here for five straight minutes. Wait, how else can I change this to make
[1336.04s -> 1339.56s]  it- how else can I change it to be like, hey streamer, something's wrong with your webcam?
[1340.28s -> 1358.26s]  How about this? All right, this is- this is- I just plugged it in. Yeah. This is- I just plugged
[1358.26s -> 1363.69s]  the webcam in and didn't even do one setting. I just turned the fucking stream on after- this
[1363.69s -> 1376.97s]  is not even default. I just plugged it in and turned it on. No, actually that- it'd be more
[1376.97s -> 1379.93s]  like this. This is more accurate. If you just plugged it in for the first time and didn't even
[1379.93s -> 1398.97s]  fucking do any settings. Let's make me a little bit more handsome though. Now this is- this is
[1398.97s -> 1405.51s]  just the- this is the side image for every copypasta villain or monster you've ever read about.
[1405.59s -> 1435.10s]  Like, yeah, like turn the blur off. Yeah, it has to be forward and like eyes wide open and mouth
[1435.10s -> 1446.66s]  wide open. We can do a better one, hold on. Really close too, like- can we be dead? This is actually
[1446.66s -> 1490.22s]  scary. It's delayed. Oh, whoa, look at that guy. Kind of looks all right. I'm scaring me. All right,
[1490.22s -> 1496.98s]  get this off. Go shave. It's a process, okay? It's a- you know, you know when Jeremy goes like this
[1496.98s -> 1505.85s]  and he gets like right into the fucking camera and he goes like, keep the cam on. No, all right,
[1505.85s -> 1522.26s]  I- people- animals are over here. What? Oh shit, real face. This is what I really look like.
[1522.34s -> 1527.38s]  Fuck. Come on, man. We can't do that.
[1534.26s -> 1545.06s]  Here we go. This hurts my fucking eyes. I'm done. Oh, there he is for real. Now let's go the other
[1545.06s -> 1589.10s]  way. Oh, this is what I look like. Oh shit. Oh, fuck. This sound is freaking me out.
[1589.66s -> 1595.74s]  What's- my skin doesn't look like this. What's with my lips? All right, I've just burnt. I can
[1595.74s -> 1601.42s]  only stream for like three or four hours and I've already burnt like- burnt, burnt. I've already
[1601.42s -> 1621.27s]  burnt. Say it. Do it right. I've already burnt like 30 minutes. I just burnt it. Nothing's real.
[1621.27s -> 1648.31s]  Nothing is real. Nothing is real. All right, what the fuck was I doing? Sounds fucking with my head.
[1648.31s -> 1667.51s]  All right, let's go. I need a surfboard in the garden. You got it. Where do I get it? Who sells
[1667.51s -> 1674.47s]  a surfboard? It's desynced. What the fuck are you talking about? What are chocolate coins if not
[1674.47s -> 1683.51s]  for spending? I'd spend- It's not desynced. Better value. It's not desynced. What? It's not. No,
[1683.51s -> 1688.12s]  it can't be. It can't be. I refuse to believe them. Don't believe them. All right, so we need a
[1688.12s -> 1701.14s]  toy surfboard, right? Toys? Woo woo train? Where do I get a surfboard? Toad voice. It's horribly
[1701.22s -> 1713.99s]  desynced. Okay, I don't believe you. The camera is set to be- Hold on. No. The camera is set to be
[1713.99s -> 1722.04s]  delayed by 650 milliseconds. The microphone is 650 milliseconds. Ready? That's- This is how you know.
[1722.04s -> 1738.65s]  I do know because they're both set for 650. Yes, so now it's 650. My mic is 650. You're burning time.
[1738.65s -> 1752.65s]  You guys are burning time. I've got three hours. You're burning time. My voice is early. My voice
[1752.65s -> 1772.65s]  is early. This happens before the mouth moves. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yep. I already said
[1772.65s -> 1786.01s]  fucking go. No, they're right. They're right. Okay. I need a surfboard. Do I not have access
[1786.01s -> 1795.72s]  to a surfboard yet or what? I can't- I don't have a surfboard. When do you get a surfboard?
[1795.72s -> 1803.38s]  Does anybody know? Stop sign. It's going to be in the toys. They probably don't have it.
[1804.34s -> 1813.86s]  This is some kind of currency thing. No one plays this game. This is such a- People love this game.
[1813.86s -> 1819.22s]  You guys are being mean to this series for no reason. It's- This is like a fun game. Like the
[1819.22s -> 1824.58s]  piñata animals. Like, come on. What a fucking idea. A new piñata has been spotted in the desert. Ooh,
[1824.58s -> 1833.11s]  let's go. He's scared of the duck. I don't know. I can't have a surfboard. But piñatas. Like,
[1833.11s -> 1849.14s]  that's so- Look at how cool that is. All right. You got to explain to me how catching fish in
[1849.14s -> 1867.05s]  Animal Crossing is pog. But watching frog in lake is un-pog. I need an explanation here. Neither are
[1867.05s -> 1885.10s]  pog. Neither. You tell me that serpent one is un-pog. But if I- That was pretty un-pog.
[1889.74s -> 1896.30s]  Okay. So let's go over this again. So this is un-pog. But if I took the head off
[1896.30s -> 1902.54s]  this snake and put it on a standing body, gave him a shovel, and had him go like this.
[1907.42s -> 1921.59s]  That would be pog. I just want to make sure I get the facts correct with my brain.
[1922.47s -> 1934.46s]  Yes. Yo, that's pog. Why does this guy hate Animal Crossing? I love Animal Crossing.
[1936.02s -> 1940.02s]  But I don't- I refuse to believe that this is an un-pog moment right here.
[1940.74s -> 1976.74s]  That was not a good example. I like them both. And they both are fun. And I can't wait for Viva
[1976.74s -> 1988.44s]  Piñata 3. On the road again. Coming soon for the Xbox Scorpion. I'll be the guy that plays it.
[1989.08s -> 1999.93s]  All right. What does this person want? All right. You guys, I know what you're doing.
[2000.86s -> 2009.77s]  So fucking tactful. You're distracting me and derailing things so we can- You're burning time.
[2010.33s -> 2025.82s]  Fucking smart. Real smart. Pretty good idea. And I get it now. I'm very easy to- I'm very
[2025.82s -> 2042.55s]  manipulatable apparently. It's still working. All right. I'm going to go back to what I was doing
[2042.55s -> 2052.73s]  in my pog experience. Digging holes in this game sucks. But if you dig a hole in Animal Crossing-
[2053.93s -> 2075.78s]  I can't even put it there. I want to put two images side by side. I want to put this
[2077.42s -> 2082.46s]  with resident sleepers and then I want to put the Animal Crossing dig with like a bunch of pogs.
[2082.46s -> 2092.90s]  Somebody get on it. Somebody get on it. Oh, this has to be desert, desert, desert, desert, desert.
[2092.90s -> 2099.32s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's a terrible meme. It's not a- I'm not making a meme. That's from my
[2099.32s -> 2107.32s]  personal collection. I'm going to have that playing on a Roku stick behind me in a frame
[2108.04s -> 2127.98s]  for the next six weeks. Where does this go? What the fuck is this thing? Doesn't this go in the
[2127.98s -> 2134.73s]  desert? What's this? This is not the right- Oh, does this have to go in soil? Oh,
[2134.73s -> 2150.92s]  forever sucks at this game. It's a reddit joke. I have a feeling that all the people that talk
[2150.92s -> 2159.91s]  all this shit about reddit have like a post history. It's like 30 pages long. Fucking redditor.
[2159.91s -> 2169.21s]  I can't believe he uses reddit. And then you go to the like- you slash- whatever the name is.
[2169.93s -> 2176.01s]  Here it is. Like 10 pages. Like r slash smash brothers. They've been on- they have like 600
[2176.01s -> 2189.10s]  posts. And they're all at least a paragraph each. That's un-pog. All right, I gotta go back to the
[2189.10s -> 2193.98s]  desert. I want to find the new- good work. You're doing a good job. Look at you guys. Look at you
[2193.98s -> 2210.34s]  go. Look at- look at- look at you go. Uh, no, I don't want to go to the Arctic. I want a gecko.
[2211.06s -> 2219.72s]  Yes, I do. I don't think I've been here at night. Irma actually made me have fun. How
[2219.72s -> 2228.66s]  does he do it? What do you mean I made you- what? We're just hanging out here, man.
[2229.30s -> 2244.84s]  We're just having fun, man. You're forcing fun. What did you guys think? I have some like fucking
[2244.84s -> 2260.17s]  streamer playbook on how to like- we're having fun in a jail cell. I've never heard of a Java- Java
[2260.17s -> 2266.25s]  prison system where the doors are all unlocked and you can leave the prison at any time.
[2266.81s -> 2273.94s]  Yeah, sorry, you're sentenced for 20 years in prison. By the way, uh, you know, the doors are
[2273.94s -> 2279.06s]  all open and you can just- you can leave whenever you want, sir. This is a- what do you mean prison?
[2279.80s -> 2283.40s]  You can just walk out of yourself, walk out the door, and go to the nearest Wendy's and
[2283.40s -> 2331.96s]  order a fucking number four. What are you guys doing? I love the 4% battery. All right, I need
[2331.96s -> 2350.02s]  to lock this fucking thing in place. All right, let me ask you a question. Would you- would you
[2350.10s -> 2355.06s]  swipe left on this person? Wait, is it right? Would you swipe- all right, would you swipe right
[2355.06s -> 2371.51s]  on this? Yeah, I think this is one of those cases where you go, oh, I mean, it's all right, but
[2372.23s -> 2378.84s]  you got any like other pictures? And then the next four pictures are me, like, with my face
[2378.84s -> 2383.56s]  blocked out like this, and this is another person, and this is another person, and I'm like-
[2384.36s -> 2387.72s]  I'm like peeking through like this. This is where they are. It's like this.
[2399.51s -> 2406.31s]  I'd fucking- I- why would I- I'd swipe right on that person because that person's me. If I was on
[2406.31s -> 2411.03s]  tinder, it'd be like, oh yeah, that guy looks all right. I'd fucking hang out with that guy.
[2411.83s -> 2429.02s]  Gecko alert! Gecko alert! You're an egomaniac. Set off early and catch some good stuff. I like
[2429.02s -> 2435.14s]  your style. Some of the- some of the smartest people ever were, and the most successful,
[2435.22s -> 2465.99s]  and the coolest people ever were egomaniacs. Like, um, who's like an egomaniac that was
[2465.99s -> 2469.59s]  really successful that now everyone doesn't look back and go, oh, that person sucked?
[2469.59s -> 2479.86s]  Is that gonna happen to me? In like 40 years, are you guys gonna be like in your 40s and 50s
[2479.86s -> 2488.92s]  and look back and be like, oh wow, that guy sucked? Shit. All right, we're gonna dial it back.
[2491.00s -> 2495.32s]  I'm like a- I'm like a- look, here's the safe way to answer any of these questions.
[2495.32s -> 2500.20s]  Oh, what do you- how good looking do you think you are? I'm like a seven. I'm a seven, I think.
[2501.21s -> 2504.25s]  And then people are like, okay, that's not too high, but that's not too low. You got like some
[2504.25s -> 2510.20s]  confidence. Yeah, all right. I'm a seven. Just say seven for everything. Oh, I just- I just- that
[2510.20s -> 2513.72s]  was a home-cooked meal. I just cooked it for you, and I- what did you think? If you didn't like it,
[2514.36s -> 2523.93s]  that was like- I'm a seven. I was into it. 75. Sounds pretty good. Or if you are reviewing- if
[2523.93s -> 2530.07s]  you're reviewing any movie, TV show, video game, or book, just do that too. It works everywhere.
[2537.46s -> 2548.33s]  75 is terrible. 75 is not terrible. 75 is- I thought this was terrible,
[2549.13s -> 2555.61s]  but I didn't want to tell you that it was terrible. Fuck! Don't listen to that. I've done this like
[2555.61s -> 2561.74s]  10 times already on this stream. Uh-oh. No, now everyone's gonna go back and look for all the
[2561.74s -> 2576.07s]  sevens I gave to games. Oh, shit. Uh, what have I done the two recently? He gave a seven to Outer
[2576.07s -> 2582.66s]  Wilds. I did not. No, I did not. I gave that an 89. Get out of here. I did not give Animal Crossing
[2582.66s -> 2591.86s]  a seven. I did not. Outer Wilds was an 89. He hates Mario Sunshine. I didn't even- I didn't even
[2591.86s -> 2604.14s]  score Mario Sunshine. What are you talking about? He gave a seven to that ninja game. Oh, okay,
[2604.14s -> 2623.27s]  this is the image I was looking for. Rate Animal Crossing. No, I can't. Because if I give Animal
[2623.27s -> 2629.03s]  Crossing a score, it's either too low throw rocks at his house or it's too high. That game's boring.
[2629.03s -> 2646.62s]  What an idiot. This- I don't think I can take a position on there. Get the rocks. They're in my
[2646.62s -> 2655.98s]  eye. I'm having fun. It doesn't matter. It could be anything in the fucking screen right now.
[2656.62s -> 2681.19s]  All right, what was it? Here. I like Animal Crossing. This is- this is just a little, like,
[2681.19s -> 2686.63s]  this is just a little shtick, you know what I mean? But it's- I like- I really like- I really
[2686.63s -> 2694.65s]  like Animal Crossing. No one- wait. Why is there- why is there- why is there dialogue in the left
[2694.65s -> 2706.18s]  one? Why is there dialogue in the left one? Who's Lily? Lily, League of Legends team? What the fuck
[2706.18s -> 2724.52s]  did you get this from? The Legends team. What did you get this fucking image from? All right,
[2724.52s -> 2732.57s]  anyways. What was I just saying? It's a random screen cap. Oh yeah, I need a trap. Business
[2732.57s -> 2744.94s]  edition. That's not necessary. You are a boomer. All right, that- what do you want me to say? Yeah,
[2744.94s -> 2754.79s]  yes I am. Yeah, yes I am. I'm a boomer at me. Like, how do I respond to that? What's the proper way
[2754.79s -> 2768.31s]  to respond to somebody saying that now? All right, now I need a- what do they- they want a snow thing?
[2768.39s -> 2778.84s]  They know. I don't even know- I'm- that's- but that's the thing, I'm not even. All right, come on. No
[2778.84s -> 2783.75s]  snake. You go get this. I won't- look at- look at that, look at that, look at that, look at that,
[2783.75s -> 2786.07s]  look at that, look at that, look at that, look at that, look at that, look at that, yep, look at that,
[2786.07s -> 2811.40s]  yep, look at that, got it. Resident sleeper, resident sleeper, resident sleeper, resident sleeper.
[2813.19s -> 2816.47s]  You know, I'm gonna record something right now and then when I- the more- when I see them, I'm
[2816.47s -> 2838.26s]  just gonna- hold on. Yeah, let's go back. Well, not- there's a cooldown on it. I know you guys are just
[2838.26s -> 2848.30s]  doing it for fun now. All right, where's my- let's go get it. I finally am gonna get a gecko.
[2851.30s -> 2858.36s]  We're not. This is boring. I'll press it right now and it'll- you'll be- wait, this is not even
[2858.36s -> 2867.24s]  centered. This looks fucked up. What did you guys do? Well, hey, what the fuck did you just do?
[2871.80s -> 2895.38s]  What did- what did you do? What did you do? I'm sorry! All right, here we go. You don't like the
[2895.38s -> 2903.29s]  frogs. Frog at the bottom of the sea. There's a- there's a frog at the bottom- there's a leg on
[2903.29s -> 2907.69s]  the frog at the bottom of the sea. There's a leg on the frog at the bottom of the sea. There's a
[2907.69s -> 2913.21s]  sea, there's a sea, there's a hole at the bottom of the sea. There's a ward on the- ward on the leg
[2913.21s -> 2917.21s]  of the frog at- ward on the leg of the frog at the bottom of the sea. There's a ward on the leg on
[2917.21s -> 2925.42s]  the frog at the bottom of the sea. There's a hole at the bottom of the sea. There's a fly on the
[2925.42s -> 2930.70s]  ward of the leg of the frog at the bottom of the sea. There's a fly on the leg- there's a fly on
[2930.70s -> 2934.98s]  the ward of the leg of the frog at the bottom of the sea. There's a- there's something down there
[2934.98s -> 2944.94s]  at the bottom of the sea. There's a hair on the fly in the ward of the frog. There's a- there's a
[2944.94s -> 2948.94s]  hair- there's a hair on the fly in the- there's a hair on the fly on the ward of the leg of the
[2948.94s -> 2954.15s]  frog at the bottom of the sea. There's a hair on the fly in the ward of the frog in the log- fuck!
[2959.16s -> 2979.67s]  You guys didn't go to preschool? How many- what- you guys how- ow! What you made me do? I'm not
[2979.67s -> 2983.19s]  American. What you guys didn't have like the- there's a this, and a this, and a this, and a this, and a
[2983.19s -> 2985.67s]  this, and a this, and a this, and a this, and a this, and a this, and a this, and a this, and a that,
[2985.67s -> 2988.95s]  and then everyone's like laughs, and has fun, everyone's like moving around, and cheering,
[2988.95s -> 2996.66s]  and stuff. What- what- what- what happened? You guys didn't do that? You just don't remember you
[2996.66s -> 3004.81s]  did. I do. I remember everything. Nobody had that. I feel bad that you didn't have the fucking this,
[3004.81s -> 3009.86s]  and the this, and the this, and the this, and the this, and the this thing. It was so much fun.
[3016.73s -> 3024.50s]  I actually did. Yeah, I know. Good. What are you doing? Look, all right. I'm gonna- okay, I'll get-
[3025.38s -> 3033.86s]  I know- I- I know that there's- I know that about that chocolate factory. Okay? I know it- I know
[3033.86s -> 3043.48s]  that the chocolate factory is- I know that's a chocolate factory. All right. What are you guys
[3043.48s -> 3051.62s]  linking? You got- I'm- but wait a minute, but I'm running out of time here. I hate that I know
[3051.62s -> 3068.79s]  what you're talking about. See? I knew it. What? What's wrong with this? You guys- here's the bad
[3068.79s -> 3072.95s]  meme you asked for. Wait, did- we already showed- wait, have you been gone for the last like 30
[3072.95s -> 3086.31s]  minutes making this? Somebody did it already. Shit, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. But this one's good too.
[3087.11s -> 3109.96s]  This one's also good. This is seven out of ten? Hey. Hey! Hey! No, this is- I would give this- I
[3109.96s -> 3123.77s]  would give this an eight. Okay, here we go. What the fuck am I doing? I want- where's the gecko?
[3123.77s -> 3130.62s]  Did you guys make me lose my gecko? I think you actually made me lose the gecko. I think he left.
[3131.26s -> 3146.12s]  You gotta be kidding me. I can't believe it. I can't believe it. Gecko's gone. Play- play
[3146.12s -> 3170.42s]  Tokyo. No. I'm gonna play Ikaruga. I'll play Ikaruga tomorrow. I can beat that game in like
[3170.42s -> 3179.37s]  two or three hours. You guys don't think I'll be able to do Ikaruga? Oh, you've got something.
[3180.25s -> 3194.15s]  You'll see. You should play as a guaranteed no. You don't have to beat every game in one stream.
[3194.79s -> 3202.14s]  I mean, Ikaruga's only- I looked up time to beat and it said an hour and a half.
[3202.78s -> 3210.52s]  I think I could do it. Here, this is important. Please, can you pretty please get me a kitty?
[3210.52s -> 3213.83s]  Yeah, sure. The cat doesn't want to come over here. There's plenty of food over here.
[3216.55s -> 3222.58s]  All right, now I- where are the ducks? Ducks need to eat crabs. I need a taffy.
[3222.58s -> 3229.10s]  I'm starting to loomer. Sorry about that. I've played Resident Evil 4, god damn it.
[3240.06s -> 3262.31s]  Is this- is this- is this just shout games that you like our- is this just yell games that you like
[3263.27s -> 3282.78s]  the hour like Gex? Oh, shit. I have a 3DO. I have like 15 3DO games and I have a 3DO.
[3282.78s -> 3290.02s]  I was supposed to do that very recently. I was supposed to play a 3DO, but for some reason,
[3290.02s -> 3294.68s]  I did not do it. I said I was going to do it like next week, but I didn't do it though.
[3294.68s -> 3309.78s]  Weird that I- weird that- weird that I- kind of weird that I- kind of weird that I- kind of weird
[3309.78s -> 3316.46s]  that I- okay, what the fucking happened there? I think I messed up. Kind of weird that I bring
[3316.46s -> 3327.91s]  that up because I was supposed to play Gex like three weeks ago. Real voice revealed.
[3327.91s -> 3345.08s]  Fuck, Eagle. This game's boring. Play Fortnite. I'm never going to open Fortnite on this stream.
[3345.80s -> 3353.30s]  Ever. Ever. I will never open that video game on this stream. I got- I got real close.
[3356.79s -> 3359.35s]  Those of you that know what the Fortnite stream was going to be, it's the only time I was going
[3359.35s -> 3366.94s]  to open it. That was going to be the vape pen stream. Remember? I was going to be in like
[3367.74s -> 3375.10s]  stunner shades and like really bright colors and just smash on a fucking vape pen and I was going
[3375.10s -> 3379.02s]  to have, over the course of like an hour of playing it, I was going to fill this room. I was going to
[3379.02s -> 3383.26s]  have, well not this one, but I was going to do somewhere that was safe to do it and have
[3383.26s -> 3389.34s]  fog machines just fill the fucking room with just vapor and I was going to sit in there until I
[3389.34s -> 3402.15s]  disappeared completely. There was going to be like a- and I was going to still just be fucking
[3402.15s -> 3410.78s]  doing it and still talking and like just like going for like fucking a shot. That stream was
[3410.78s -> 3417.69s]  going to be like 40 minutes long but I didn't because that means I'd have to open Fortnite.
[3418.33s -> 3435.05s]  That's- that's a struggle for me. That was going to happen like two years ago.
[3435.05s -> 3451.34s]  I just never did it. Someone's just going to steal that joke. I hope it's funny.
[3454.81s -> 3478.28s]  Here are four- ah! I have to play fucking Viva Piñata! This is a comp- this is a comp stream
[3478.28s -> 3486.81s]  with the- this is a comp stream with a video in the background. You don't even want to play this,
[3486.81s -> 3494.46s]  you know it. No, you are wrong! You are wrong! You're wrong! I think this is fun and I think
[3494.46s -> 3504.36s]  it's cute. He's not even playing. I- what do you mean not even playing? This is- look at the title
[3504.36s -> 3508.76s]  of the stream. This is like looking at an aquarium that you've like reached in sometimes.
[3509.72s -> 3524.81s]  This is an interactive screensaver. I- why am I playing? Look at how much fun they're having.
[3526.20s -> 3533.86s]  All right, slow down. I can't believe that you guys aren't getting behind like- I can't believe
[3533.86s -> 3541.96s]  like Quack Crew is not- where's the Quack Crew at? Where's Quack Crew? Can I manufacture one? Can I
[3541.96s -> 3547.62s]  like force one of these? I don't think I can do that, can I? Where's the Quack Crew? No, it's- it
[3547.62s -> 3552.49s]  doesn't work that way. This is like when some like company on social media desperately tries to make
[3552.49s -> 3556.57s]  their own fucking version of a meme and everyone's like, wow, that was fucking stupid and lame and
[3556.57s -> 3577.90s]  shitty. Yeah, I can't. Quack Pack! Yeah, where's the Quack Pack? Look it! Uh, guys, where's the
[3577.90s -> 3585.34s]  Quack Pack? Wow, nice game, Omega Low. You didn't just think that that was fucking cute when he
[3585.34s -> 3588.38s]  just drank the water out of the dirt there, like he just like licked it up off the ground. It was
[3588.38s -> 3595.66s]  like cute. He like was laughing up like a dog. Like, fuck. Grimp. Grimp. Grimp. Grimp. Grimp. Grimp.
[3596.92s -> 3603.45s]  What? But that's not how that- what that noise makes. It's like,
[3605.43s -> 3625.16s]  that's not grimp. Gramp? Grimp? Stop distracting me. Okay, I gotta- I gotta water this. Is it
[3625.16s -> 3633.13s]  already watered all the way? It's sitting in water. I already got stupid. All right, kill this. He
[3633.13s -> 3651.29s]  sounds like a sim. Jeremy, are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. What? What? What? What? Shit! Put this down!
[3660.87s -> 3666.42s]  I'm fine. No, guys, I'm not gonna like after this- I don't know, some of you guys think I like after
[3666.42s -> 3671.90s]  the stream is over, I like go and take a hot shower and just like scream into the water. Like,
[3674.94s -> 3683.26s]  like, I don't just fucking yell in the shower. I mean, I mean, I do- everybody does that though.
[3685.40s -> 3692.30s]  Who- all right, let me ask them. Who doesn't fill their mouth with water every like 45 seconds in
[3692.30s -> 3698.55s]  the shower and then just go- just spit it out. Everybody does that. Everybody just goes,
[3699.59s -> 3706.15s]  fills and then just goes- if you don't do- you're a liar if you don't do that. That's a lie.
[3707.51s -> 3711.99s]  Everybody fills their mouth with the fucking water every like minute and then just like
[3711.99s -> 3740.17s]  just flushes it off there and out of their mouth. Yes, you do. I- no way. Oh shit. I don't like
[3740.17s -> 3750.06s]  people watching me drink water. It freaks me out. I admit it, laughing my ass off. Good. You-
[3750.06s -> 3757.90s]  seriously? Yes, you do. Imagine- can you like imagine lying about if you put water in your
[3757.90s -> 3765.72s]  mouth and spit it out in the shower into the ground? Come on. I'm sorry, we don't- I don't
[3765.72s -> 3780.31s]  drink it. I just- you go and you go- who goes like this? Everybody does. You get in the shower and
[3780.31s -> 3795.75s]  you go, yes, you do. Yes, you do. You get in the shower and you go like this and like it does- yes,
[3795.75s -> 3805.02s]  you do. Everybody does that. I want- next time you take a shower, I want you to be very aware
[3805.02s -> 3809.27s]  of what you're doing so you don't even realize you're doing it. You get in and like the shower- you're
[3809.27s -> 3812.23s]  waiting for the shower because you're blocking the shower might not be hot enough or too cold
[3812.23s -> 3816.94s]  or too hot so you like just getting it ready and then it- yes, it is. I want you to be aware of it
[3816.94s -> 3820.22s]  next time and then you're gonna go- you're gonna get in the shower, you're gonna be like, that guy
[3820.22s -> 3825.74s]  Jerma is a fucking idiot. He's so fucking weird. He's like the weirdest guy I've ever known in my life.
[3834.30s -> 3839.54s]  He was right! And then you're gonna come- and like in a week, you're gonna fucking come to the stream
[3839.54s -> 3844.60s]  and you can say, hey man, I've done a week of showers and you were right and I'll be like, I know,
[3844.60s -> 3857.32s]  welcome back. And then you're gonna do something that I don't even do. You're gonna go like this
[3862.78s -> 3866.70s]  and then you're gonna be like, whoa, I do disgusting shit in here apparently
[3866.78s -> 3873.74s]  and oh oops oh yeah that's- oh no but I- Jerma's the weirdo. Jerma the weirdo. He puts his hands up
[3873.74s -> 3886.55s]  and like puts water in his mouth. Hold on a second. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. It's- it's
[3886.55s -> 3904.65s]  unbelievable. My dad does that and that's- and that's where you get it. You get it from your dad.
[3904.65s -> 3917.91s]  It's in your- it's in like your DNA. Wait, why?
[3960.38s -> 3963.26s]  I'm playing an animal. This is not Animal Crossing.
[3974.71s -> 3993.29s]  It's okay. This is the worst stream of 2020. No way. No way. No way. No way. No way. No way.
[3993.37s -> 4002.44s]  No way. We're not even- we're not even into fucking April. You got way more nominees.
[4015.74s -> 4020.86s]  You promised me a kitty. I can't just fucking- I gotta wait for one of them to get in here.
[4021.74s -> 4031.45s]  I'm actually having a lot of fun. I don't know what you guys are talking about. I'm having like
[4031.45s -> 4035.53s]  a ton of fun. Can I like nominate this for like most like fucking quirky stream of-
[4035.53s -> 4067.94s]  Oh, there's no cat. Get back here. No. If you didn't like, no, I'm Petula. My runs used to run
[4067.94s -> 4076.10s]  this shop till the- I suppose you better select a piñata to give this to. Oh my fucking god.
[4077.06s -> 4104.70s]  First select where the accessory should go on your piñata. Oh, that's good. Oh, that's so funny.
[4105.66s -> 4137.50s]  Should I give him German hair? How about the wizard? Okay, what about eyes? No, no glasses.
[4137.50s -> 4152.17s]  No glasses. A nose ring? Oh, I could do a clown nose. Holy shit. No. No, I don't want that. I don't
[4152.17s -> 4161.21s]  want that. I want little shoes though. Is that the only shoes? I want like little sneakers.
[4178.65s -> 4186.46s]  What about this? What about the bow tie? No, I don't want- I don't want the hair. I want something
[4186.70s -> 4202.39s]  on the head. Look at that. So cute. Clown nose over riot. There's like 10 animals to do this to.
[4206.14s -> 4225.48s]  This. Okay, that looks all right. Good choice. Well, now we need- now we need to do it to the-
[4227.14s -> 4235.26s]  look at- look at how cool he looks. I don't want you to have anything. I'm always a frog. I want
[4235.26s -> 4244.58s]  the frog to have something. The snake. Yep. This is real exciting. Can somebody link the other
[4244.58s -> 4263.54s]  Animal Crossing shovel image again, please? Oh, I love the hard hat. It's perfect. Oh, the wizard
[4263.54s -> 4280.95s]  cap. Yes, the hard hat. Hard hat and like glasses. Oh, they- they don't go like this? They- shouldn't
[4280.95s -> 4289.21s]  they go like that? Click that link. What do you mean me click that link? This is for you to click.
[4289.21s -> 4312.62s]  German, what the fuck? This is like- okay. This is what it looks like when you go back and look at
[4312.62s -> 4322.65s]  like history and paintings and shit. This is like a historical painting of me. If I was- if I was
[4322.65s -> 4336.46s]  like some- some like fucking senator from like 1402 or like 1400. But like I actually look like this
[4337.02s -> 4352.63s]  looking at a mirror in a dream. Yeah, I was gonna say this is like dreamy person. Let's see if I
[4352.63s -> 4368.25s]  can match it. There's no difference. Yes, there is. There's a fucking huge difference. I need this one
[4368.25s -> 4373.56s]  to be moving, though. You guys gotta tell me which one's real. You already fucking know. What
[4373.56s -> 4413.77s]  are you talking about? It's like before and after. Yeah, it's before and after I get like
[4413.77s -> 4449.90s]  cosmetic surgery. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. There. All right. Yeah, that's like before and
[4449.90s -> 4474.71s]  after. I go- I go get like some work done. I'm not growing out my beard. Wow, he fucking hates this
[4474.71s -> 4480.25s]  game.
[4487.14s -> 4497.42s]  What are you guys doing? What are you doing? Stop. You have less than two hours to play. I know. I'm
[4497.42s -> 4517.22s]  sorry. I'm trying. How did I bite my lip? Fuck, did I bite my lip?
[4525.58s -> 4534.86s]  Why, what the fuck? We already went over this.
[4539.77s -> 4546.04s]  We've already talked about that. Remember kids, everything you write is saved forever on the
[4546.04s -> 4552.20s]  internet. Don't forget that ever. I wrote this like a year or two ago and it's still here.
[4552.68s -> 4568.57s]  It's- I have what? Okay. Okay, cool. I will do one more. Let's do the frog.
[4575.03s -> 4580.39s]  Okay. I suppose I'll pick a piñata. Sure, how about you?
[4582.39s -> 4596.25s]  All right, the frog's gonna have a big top hat. Yes. Oh. Oh, you could marry. And a monocle,
[4596.25s -> 4614.84s]  of course. Yes, and the monocle will be bright. And is a piece of Professor Clown,
[4614.84s -> 4632.02s]  Professor Clownsworth. This is just Mr. Peanut. Mr. Peanut. What the fuck?
[4645.10s -> 4655.22s]  No, no, none of this. Wait. Yes. No, it's- Thanks on behalf of my absence. When you get back to
[4655.22s -> 4664.63s]  your garden, you should like think about me. Okay. I won't say bye because you'll probably be right
[4664.63s -> 4673.40s]  back in here really soon. All right. Now, what's it gonna look like? Let me, let me, let's see.
[4673.40s -> 4684.79s]  What am I gonna do? Let me just fucking, let me just. Come on. Come on. Hurry up. There's only like
[4684.79s -> 4689.83s]  this. I got eight more seconds before this doesn't work anymore. Okay. I'm thinking about, let's see
[4689.83s -> 4704.47s]  what I want to do here. Come on. Big spin. Big spin here. What do we got? Big spin. Yeah. I don't
[4704.47s -> 4718.89s]  care. I don't care if you didn't like it. I don't care. I think I'm gonna get some yams.
[4733.56s -> 4749.37s]  Okay. So what do I need? I was gonna buy a reminder. Stream ends in one hour and 40 minutes.
[4749.37s -> 4757.18s]  Fucking god damn it. Do I need to put more time on this shit? It's been an hour and 20 minutes
[4757.18s -> 4775.70s]  already. Fuck. Okay. I want to do some paving. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Stone. Stone. Insert another
[4775.70s -> 4782.84s]  coin. Put more quarters in. Where do I want to put the stones? I think I want to put them over here
[4782.84s -> 4801.34s]  next to the snakes. Yeah. Like this. A little bit here. A little bit like over here. Okay. I'm bored.
[4801.34s -> 4824.98s]  Let's play Mario Yahtzee. No. You look better. I don't, what are you doing? Why are you, why are
[4824.98s -> 4840.89s]  you linking this? Why are you linking? I don't know what this is for. 2015. Okay. So this is,
[4841.69s -> 4845.77s]  this is the, the day that Battlefront came out. The original Battlefront.
[4848.98s -> 4856.18s]  How else do you want me to explain this? This is me pretending to be really excited for Battlefront.
[4856.18s -> 4865.94s]  You knew I needed to explain this? You sure? I didn't play Battlefront. You need me to explain
[4865.94s -> 4876.07s]  this? You can't get that from me. I don't have one minute in Battlefront. I need to apologize for
[4876.07s -> 4890.63s]  this. You were 30 when you tweeted this. No. You just did the same thing. You just did the same
[4890.63s -> 4896.87s]  fucking thing. This doesn't work. This does not work because you did the same exact thing. It did
[4896.87s -> 4910.98s]  not change at all. This doesn't work. Paul, the only thing that happened was I was ready for the
[4910.98s -> 4918.25s]  picture on the left one and I wasn't ready for the picture on the right one. This is like the
[4918.25s -> 4923.38s]  30 selfies you take and then you delete 28 of them and you pick the one that you're like, wait,
[4923.38s -> 4932.01s]  whoa, I look like a fucking weirdo in that one. You know just how much your face can fucking change
[4933.19s -> 4938.47s]  in, here's an experiment. Okay. So we're going to do this. Here's an experiment. What I'd like
[4938.47s -> 4942.39s]  you to do is we're going to, remember, I remember I'm taking selfies of myself over the course of
[4942.39s -> 4946.95s]  three or four seconds. I would like for whoever wants to do this to take a frame, every frame of
[4946.95s -> 4954.18s]  this, and we'll go over them and we're going to see how shitty half of them look. Are you ready?
[4954.18s -> 4984.55s]  Here we go. Click, click, click. Okay. So at least 40 of those 50 frames were terrible.
[4985.27s -> 5007.58s]  They were terrible. Every frame is bad. Why are my eyes so huge? What? You have big, I've got big
[5007.58s -> 5035.82s]  fucking eyes. There's no filter on. T minus hour and 40 minutes. I know, I know, I know, I know,
[5035.82s -> 5053.26s]  I know, I know. Alita Battle Angel. They're not that big. That looks nice. That didn't even look
[5053.26s -> 5069.56s]  good. All right. Look at me. I know everything about paving. That looks good. Yeah, that looks
[5069.56s -> 5079.77s]  good. All right. That's fine. Somebody just said you're surprised that I know what Alita
[5079.77s -> 5090.63s]  Battle Angel is. Do you think that, okay, so after every stream, after every single fucking stream,
[5090.63s -> 5096.17s]  there's just sand outside and I just, I'm like, all right, I'm done with the broadcast today.
[5096.89s -> 5127.56s]  It's been swell. Okay. Good night, everybody. And then 12 hours go by. Oh, fuck. That looked really bad.
[5130.02s -> 5135.27s]  It looked like it was fake. Oh, fucking god damn it.
[5139.13s -> 5146.41s]  Stop playing. We're in it. No, we got an hour and a half left of this particular broadcast.
[5146.41s -> 5153.96s]  We're all in at this point. I'm making at least one more duck. Worst hair, worst hair. Fuck. It's
[5153.96s -> 5159.64s]  all right. Whatever. It's not going to win. Don't worry. I'll have a greasy ass head in like four
[5159.64s -> 5166.31s]  months. What is this? What, do you guys think that changing the game is going to change what's
[5166.31s -> 5172.17s]  going on in the chat now and what the stream is derailed into? This is not, this is what we're
[5172.17s -> 5191.51s]  doing. Why can I not open this image? It's Bill and Ted hair. Wait, somebody, wait, what? Bill and Ted?
[5192.39s -> 5199.06s]  Why could I not, I can't even connect to the internet. Does somebody have a comparison?
[5200.74s -> 5214.74s]  Bill and Ted. Why can I not connect to the fucking internet? Am I stream still on? I can't open up
[5214.74s -> 5245.72s]  any of these links because it's on, is Discord having problems? Nice link, dude. What? This is,
[5245.72s -> 5261.50s]  what the fuck is this? You swapped my eyes? Hold on. Let's go. I need to go over this. So this is
[5262.39s -> 5275.64s]  normal eyes. Hold on. Normal. Right eye and right eye. What? Who looks better?
[5275.64s -> 5290.44s]  This is left and left. Left and left doesn't look good. And this is eyes swapped. Which one looks the
[5290.44s -> 5297.83s]  best? All right. Bottom right and bottom left look fucking awful. Top right, I think looks the best
[5297.83s -> 5306.06s]  to me. What do you think? Oh, okay. If we're going to, if we're going to rate these on like on order,
[5306.06s -> 5314.26s]  okay. Number one is top right. Number two is top left. No, all right. Fourth eye swapped is number
[5314.26s -> 5320.41s]  three. And at the bottom is left. And my left eye is not the strong eye, huh? This eye is not the
[5320.41s -> 5334.54s]  strong one. Look what top right is looking. I don't get it. Left and left is himbo germa.
[5357.56s -> 5381.50s]  No comments. What do you mean no comments? Where's kitty floss?
[5381.50s -> 5470.95s]  Oh god damn it. It's like the same face. It's the same, the same energy is coming off of these images.
[5470.95s -> 5495.77s]  Same actor. Okay, that's enough. I'm done with this. Grow a beard? I can't grow a beard.
[5495.77s -> 5500.89s]  You think I can grow a beard? This is the extent of what I'm capable of. You don't want to get it
[5500.89s -> 5505.13s]  up close and personal here. You're gonna see all my nose hairs. They need to be trimmed. They're very,
[5505.13s -> 5510.86s]  very long. They're very long. You don't want to see them. I don't want to get that close so you
[5510.86s -> 5518.25s]  can see them and you can count how many. No, no, I haven't had time to do any trimming or any any
[5518.25s -> 5528.10s]  any of this stuff. There's a spider on the ceiling. Oh wow. There's a spider on the ceiling.
[5528.10s -> 5559.40s]  Get a hold of this guy. What the fuck am I doing? I just like stopped. Did you see that? You just
[5559.40s -> 5566.33s]  watched the train leave the station on camera. It just like I was just here. I stopped. It was
[5566.33s -> 5577.93s]  like the eye halted. It was like his brain was empty. All right, time to fill my brain with
[5577.93s -> 5585.62s]  knowledge. What was I doing? I have no fucking, oh this has been no experience gained. Nothing's
[5585.62s -> 5592.78s]  happened and I've and we're like halfway through the stream. What? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[5592.86s -> 5600.01s]  wait a minute. I gave them funny hats. So that's excuse me. This dude's high as a kite. I'm not
[5600.94s -> 5607.62s]  at all. Why are they all hanging out over here? Why have none of them been eaten yet?
[5609.83s -> 5629.86s]  I feel like this is one of the Muppets. Next resident sleeper. There is no next. There's a
[5629.86s -> 5637.77s]  next tomorrow. There's an Ikaruga tomorrow. Not right now. Let me at least do the one thing I
[5637.77s -> 5647.34s]  wanted to do. Please, please. And that one thing was, okay, I got the two ducks. They need to eat
[5647.34s -> 5659.34s]  crabs. I need a crab. I need a surfboard. First of all, Odama tomorrow. I need to say this on
[5659.34s -> 5664.22s]  camera because people don't would just apparently don't want to get this solidified into their
[5664.22s -> 5678.39s]  brains. I will, why am I blinking so much? I will never play Odama the GameCube ever again. Okay,
[5688.38s -> 5693.53s]  I need a house. I need to get a mouse house. We have, uh, I need these two birds are still
[5693.53s -> 5703.45s]  hanging. They've been sleeping for like four days. Let me go to, I need a gecko. That's what I want.
[5703.45s -> 5715.11s]  Gecko. Go get one. That's the ice place. Go to the desert. Actually get a gecko. That's what I want.
[5715.11s -> 5722.86s]  A kitty floss. Will they have to show up? Is a gecko in your mailbox? Well, I'm going to get two of
[5722.86s -> 5738.74s]  them. You missed like three. Show webcam. We want to see your face. Show webcam. I'd recommend that.
[5738.74s -> 5742.98s]  I don't like the, I don't like the frog that talks. It takes away my version. I give them
[5742.98s -> 5749.30s]  their own voices. Like for me, that's like, not like this. You know what I mean? It's like,
[5749.30s -> 5765.61s]  oh, it's fucked it all up for me. Okay. We need to get bait. Uh, come get it. I'll get two.
[5765.61s -> 5775.69s]  Voice is wrong. We demand orange. We demand orange. There we go. This is exactly what I was
[5775.69s -> 5815.13s]  talking about. This is the exact thing. Yep. Why do they all look like this? Why do all the
[5815.13s -> 5821.02s]  paintings from like the 13th century, 14th, why do they look like that? That's how people looked.
[5821.02s -> 5832.09s]  What? This is not even, you just like made my nose a little more bulby. But this is, what the
[5832.09s -> 5841.38s]  fuck even is this? I'm going to show this on stream. Yeah. And that's not even an edit. That's just me
[5841.38s -> 5852.39s]  going like, ah, let's head back. Now let's make the geckos happy. Very happy. Did I bump you? I'm
[5852.39s -> 5862.44s]  so sorry. Okay. Go to the post office. Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang.
[5866.31s -> 5875.27s]  Sorry. I have to do this every time. Some of you guys weren't here yesterday. Some of you guys
[5875.27s -> 5880.87s]  weren't here yesterday. There's a thing, talk about the mouth flap hitting hard and it's chasing you
[5880.87s -> 5892.62s]  in a nightmare. This is like literally yesterday. I had a dream last night. It was crazy. It had
[5892.62s -> 5898.04s]  something to do with Twitch. What was it? Oh my God. What was it? I remember I was like, ah, maybe
[5898.04s -> 5908.28s]  I should fucking like say something about this. Fuck. What was it? I don't remember. Damn it.

[5943.38s -> 5967.45s]  store? This is like when the, this is like the part of the movie where the caveman guy comes into
[5967.45s -> 5971.37s]  society and they're trying to teach him how to count to 10 and they're trying to teach him numbers
[5971.37s -> 5977.42s]  and squares and shapes and shit. This is part of, that's part of that movie. They've done this like

[6180.92s -> 6199.37s]  I need three corns. Oh, that's not Chadbird. Did I lose the gecko again? I need to bring in...
[6199.37s -> 6204.17s]  What do they need? This and something else. Let me take a look at the encyclopedia. Let me actually
[6204.17s -> 6217.58s]  learn. Hulk waiting room. You're gonna be waiting for a little while. When can we expect a movie?
[6219.48s -> 6229.70s]  When can you expect me to make a movie? Okay. White flutter. Does it matter? White flutter scotch.
[6231.74s -> 6237.00s]  Okay. Up here I have one daisy in the garden. No, it's the other ones. It's a regular one,
[6237.00s -> 6243.00s]  right? When are you doing the chocolate factory tour? Guys, we thought... We brought this up
[6243.00s -> 6251.00s]  yesterday afternoon. It's not just like, okay, time to go to the chocolate factory and broadcast
[6251.00s -> 6264.39s]  from a chocolate factory. How do I make the regular flutter thing show up? It was... I need...
[6264.39s -> 6274.36s]  What was it? It was the... It was the torches and what? Do that tomorrow. I can't go... All right.
[6274.36s -> 6288.52s]  That's enough. That's enough. That's enough. Mods. Mods. Start mods. Oh, okay. There's one.
[6288.52s -> 6300.97s]  But how do I get the other ones? You all right? Oh, you're on fire. Here. What are you doing?
[6307.35s -> 6310.39s]  Backgammon waiting room. I don't know how to play backgammon. You're going to be waiting
[6310.39s -> 6323.34s]  forever. I... How? I need ducks, but they need to eat crabs. All right. I'm getting a cat.
[6323.34s -> 6335.94s]  I'm just buying one. Can I buy a cat? I don't... I don't know how to play backgammon.
[6340.92s -> 6350.60s]  I don't have any money. I can't even buy one. Gekko was a resident already. I don't see him.
[6350.60s -> 6364.02s]  Where? I want to hear a story. I don't really have many stories. Where's the Gekko that's the
[6364.02s -> 6380.04s]  resident? I don't see a resident Gekko. Oh, yes. Okay. Now what do you need? I need to eat a moth
[6380.04s -> 6386.90s]  drop. All right. You'll stick around though. Look at how cute he is. I knew people were going to do
[6386.90s -> 6390.95s]  resident Gekko with the resident sleeper. I knew you were going to do that. All right. It's time
[6390.95s -> 6403.64s]  to start selling people. Sell. Sell. Sell all the birds. Sell the birds and sell the bird.
[6405.59s -> 6412.33s]  If you're not a duck, then I'm going to sell you. Play Resident Evil 4. I'm going to.
[6413.13s -> 6425.13s]  I'm gonna play Resident Evil 4. Just not in the next 20 minutes. Good. Now I need a Gekko house.
[6435.62s -> 6442.02s]  Ooh, cool. Somebody said Resident Evil 4 sucks. Do you guys understand there's no way I could ever
[6442.02s -> 6448.04s]  make all of you happy? Even if a majority of you guys want to see Resident Evil 4, somebody just
[6448.04s -> 6458.04s]  said Resident Evil 4 sucks. You know what I mean? Like, what do you want me to do? Pizza. Pizza.
[6458.04s -> 6463.85s]  Pizza. Pizza. Pizza. Pizza. Take off your shirt. And that person actually for like at least five
[6463.85s -> 6479.06s]  minutes. All right. I need to do Gekko house. We're going to put it over here. Where's the door?
[6480.36s -> 6488.57s]  Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Take off your glasses.
[6496.55s -> 6535.67s]  Fuck. I hate this. I hate this. But I'm going to show it anyways. I hate this. Build it. All right.
[6535.67s -> 6539.27s]  That looks good. I'm going to buy a couple more of these. I'm going to buy like four or five
[6539.27s -> 6543.03s]  watercresses and put them along the edge here. Do I have enough money for that?
[6543.03s -> 6549.67s]  Do a voice. I can't do. Oh, fuck. He's on fire. Why the hell burning?
[6555.32s -> 6558.68s]  I think we have to be careful. We have some more. Hold on. I think I get it. Just give me a minute.
[6564.26s -> 6571.05s]  I think that I like, I think that we can maybe get some quality entertainment here school.
[6571.05s -> 6573.61s]  Oh, yes.
[6576.81s -> 6581.69s]  Like maybe we should stop streaming school. I think maybe that's a good idea.
[6589.78s -> 6593.86s]  Don't say I didn't fucking try. Come back soon and try again.
[6593.86s -> 6625.53s]  Okay. Scooby-Doo isn't a Yoda horse. Um, what the fuck are you talking about?
[6628.46s -> 6636.34s]  Yes, he is. Scooby-Doo is can be absolutely described as a Yoda horse.
[6642.66s -> 6655.78s]  Are you serious? Yes. Are you kidding me? It's true. Why are you don't you? Yeah, you can't.
[6656.42s -> 6662.82s]  Yeah, like, like, like, I almost got it. I'm close. I'm really,
[6662.82s -> 6665.22s]  if you give me like four or five hours in the mirror tonight, I'll get it.
[6665.22s -> 6673.08s]  I've never tried that before. Don't I have another gecko?
[6683.66s -> 6688.92s]  Please buy a milk bottle. People happy. Kitty floss. I'm crying. There's not going to be a
[6688.92s -> 6694.20s]  kitty floss because there are no kitty flosses that care about my house. They don't care about
[6694.20s -> 6708.23s]  this place. Oh, look, a Gekki. Eat that right there. Right there. There is no, that's a fox.
[6708.23s -> 6712.84s]  This is a fox. I don't want one of these. I had them last time right there. I see one. No,
[6712.84s -> 6719.22s]  you don't. That's a lie. Oh my God. You're not a liar. Okay. Come here. How do I do this?
[6719.22s -> 6735.30s]  Direct a mouse over here. Come here. Oh shit. He's going to eat it. Yeah. Now I have two geckos for
[6735.30s -> 6739.32s]  residents and I'm going to give them hats. Stop eating this food before you get, I'm going to
[6739.32s -> 6768.34s]  sell you if you don't cut the shit. Break the shit. Break the shed. Break the shed. Wait,
[6768.34s -> 6782.02s]  isn't that from Courage? Cowardly Dog? Return. What is it? Return the slab. Return the slab.
[6784.44s -> 6803.61s]  Super dog. Yes, Gekki 2. All right. Let me see what the house looks like. Oh, Courage. Be careful
[6803.61s -> 6810.44s]  out there. Don't go out too late at night. You're putting too much effort into this dumb dog.
[6811.16s -> 6827.86s]  Oh, does she have an Irish accent? I don't know. She doesn't? She's Scottish. Oh, well,
[6827.86s -> 6849.56s]  this is nice. Look at this place. How is this a gecko house? Okay. Now for them to, I have two.
[6850.28s -> 6861.16s]  They both need to eat a moth drop. How do I get a moth drop to come stay? Permanently. Let's look
[6861.16s -> 6872.44s]  it up. This is a baby game. Play Dead or Alive. Does anybody actually play that game? Like,
[6872.44s -> 6880.60s]  do people play that game? Isn't that a fighting game? Did they just give up and just start making
[6880.60s -> 6893.69s]  fucking like beach simulations? Do they still make Dead or Alive the fighting game? Isn't it good?
[6893.69s -> 6908.20s]  Isn't Dead or Alive a good game? Like fighting game wise? Isn't it like a good game? It was.
[6908.20s -> 6915.78s]  The old ones are pretty good. Yeah. I'm just saying what I've heard. All right. I don't think
[6915.78s -> 6926.06s]  I even have any info. How do I attract one? There we go. Moth drop. Peer requirements. Night time
[6926.06s -> 6932.87s]  in the garden. All right. But have a light in the garden. Night time in the garden.
[6932.87s -> 6948.20s]  How do I make you stay? Wait for night time. Play Dead or Alive. I'm not, I don't play fighting games.
[6949.26s -> 6954.23s]  No, I don't play them. It's not even just like, oh, I don't stream that. I, that, it's just not.
[6954.23s -> 6962.12s]  I just don't. All right. There's a moth drop right here. Has eaten one bluebell flower. Here we go.
[6962.12s -> 6982.38s]  Check this out. Bluebell flower. Plant them. Put a couple here right in their spot that they like.
[6982.38s -> 6992.84s]  Well, this is so POG. This is an, this is a POG only stream. Okay. I'll do fertilizer on these.
[6992.84s -> 7005.06s]  Does it matter? Just blue fertilizer, right? Kind of POG, I guess. POG only. So let's do a fertilizer.
[7005.70s -> 7011.62s]  Plant a bunch of shit and then get a bunch of fertilizer. What should I do first? Plant first,
[7011.62s -> 7018.58s]  then fertilizer. Was it fertilize first and plant or plant then fertilize? Fertilizer goes on
[7018.58s -> 7030.34s]  afterwards, right? I know. Like you, you smeared my face up a little bit. God, I'm so, okay.
[7031.08s -> 7034.84s]  Very on POG of you. I hope the same people doing Resident Sleeper do the same thing for
[7034.84s -> 7041.43s]  Animal Crossing. People happy. Um, I think that half the people doing that are doing it because
[7042.07s -> 7047.37s]  they just, they, they just want to cause chaos. They just want constant fucking conflict.
[7051.26s -> 7056.98s]  I know. I saw it. I saw it. It's fertilizer after, right? We're doing, we need bluebell.
[7057.94s -> 7077.78s]  Do I not have it in my bag? Fuck. Ah, mean flower. Just watch Family Guy funny moments. Why would I
[7077.78s -> 7092.10s]  do that right now? Why would I watch Family Guy funny moments? There's no reason for me to do that.
[7092.10s -> 7096.70s]  All right. I need bluebell flowers. We need to feed these people and then they're going to go
[7097.26s -> 7100.54s]  and they're going to, we're going to have gecko. They're going to have gecko babies.
[7103.30s -> 7119.32s]  Watch TikTok compilation. All right. Fertilizer and seeds. I need seeds first, then fertilizer.
[7119.32s -> 7127.85s]  No, no, no. I mean, where's bluebell? I don't even have access to this shit. Bluebell.
[7129.83s -> 7138.26s]  You need to react. Uh, what I need to do is, holy shit, he's zooming around. You see that? Look at
[7138.26s -> 7154.26s]  them. Look at how fast they're running. Well, don't touch it then. Don't touch the fire. What
[7154.26s -> 7166.01s]  are you stupid? All right. Here we go. Plant. Fertilize. Action. I'm going to play my favorite
[7166.01s -> 7172.17s]  game. All right. On sub. Good morning. Can I interest you in something seedy? No, I don't mean
[7172.17s -> 7176.87s]  like that. That's, that's what you could title this stream. I could just change the title of
[7176.87s -> 7180.95s]  this stream to Jerma play the game I like or on sub. I could just change. I could be the title
[7180.95s -> 7208.73s]  today. All right. We need blue fertilizer. Fertilize. Fertilization. Didn't get this one,
[7208.73s -> 7222.66s]  did I? Yep. What about this one over here? Did I get this one? Yep. Okay. Water. He's not playing
[7222.66s -> 7236.36s]  farming simulator. I am. I am going to lose it. A monkey Island. I am going to lose it.
[7239.37s -> 7246.98s]  Play Toho. Until like four days ago. I didn't even know what that was.
[7249.42s -> 7268.50s]  It's, can I, give me a second. It's really good. All right. It's like, wait, why can I not do this
[7268.50s -> 7283.74s]  anymore? Wait, here they go. All right. Blue Bells are up. This is like you recommended a movie.
[7284.46s -> 7291.70s]  Hey man, you should really go see Star Wars, Return of Skywalker. Okay. Yeah, that sounds
[7291.70s -> 7295.38s]  like a good movie. Maybe I'll check it out eventually. Maybe I'll do it. Yeah, I'll probably
[7295.38s -> 7301.32s]  watch it. No, go right now. I don't want to go watch the new Star Wars movie right now.
[7301.32s -> 7308.20s]  I've got some stuff to do. No, go right now or I'm not your friend anymore. Can I just give me a
[7308.20s -> 7313.48s]  couple of days to figure out? I got to look at movie times. No, there's one playing at 5 30. Go
[7313.48s -> 7318.76s]  now. Here, let me help you. And you start like pushing me out of my house. Let me help you.
[7318.76s -> 7324.28s]  Just go out there. You open the car door. Get in. I don't want to go see the movie right now. Get
[7324.28s -> 7330.60s]  in and drive the car now. All right, fine. Jesus. And then you stand there like so like you stand
[7330.60s -> 7336.86s]  there straight in the air like a pencil till I come back. And I get out. I'm finally, I'm like,
[7336.86s -> 7342.63s]  God, I get back in the movie. You're still there. Like, and I pulled the car into the fucking
[7342.63s -> 7348.73s]  driveway and that the lights hit you and you're fucking still there standing staring. And then
[7348.73s -> 7356.66s]  the door opening was that best movie you ever seen your life? Um, well, I yeah, I know. I like
[7356.66s -> 7359.46s]  the two. It was my favorite movie ever seen my whole life. That's your favorite movie you've
[7359.46s -> 7368.82s]  ever seen your whole life, right? Sure. I thought it was great. Cool. What do you do tomorrow? Um,
[7368.82s -> 7377.24s]  I don't know, man. You should go see this movie. I'll stand here. I'll be ready. I tried to kill it
[7377.24s -> 7388.90s]  in time. Did I get it? I did. Can you stop with the movie recommendations?
[7390.92s -> 7406.28s]  Never. He hates it. Why were you friends with person in the first place?
[7412.79s -> 7425.30s]  Why were you friends with this person in the first place? Because they were a pretty normal guy
[7425.94s -> 7438.30s]  until the subject of movies came up. Kitty, please. I can't. Look, the kitty is going to come
[7438.30s -> 7452.57s]  eat. The kitty is going to come eat a bug if the kitty wants to. Oh crap. I still can't get a surf
[7452.57s -> 7463.43s]  board. Here we go. All right. Where's uh, where's my, where's my gecko friends? Four daisies in the
[7463.43s -> 7473.35s]  garden. Oh fuck. You should play Roblox. And that's another one, right? Like Roblox is so
[7473.35s -> 7479.69s]  much shit. It's like the Roblox is not like the game Roblox. It's the infrastructure Roblox. And
[7479.69s -> 7483.45s]  I've seen that often too. And that's the equivalent of not telling me to go see a specific movie.
[7483.45s -> 7490.06s]  That's telling me to go just spend my whole day in the movie theater, right? And just, hey, can
[7490.06s -> 7509.75s]  you like pick a cool movie to watch in the movie theater? I, I guess. What do you do? You're not
[7509.75s -> 7516.17s]  even, you gotta live here, man. Go watch all the Star Wars movies. All right. I need to wait till
[7516.17s -> 7530.14s]  nighttime. Are these ready to be harvested? Choo, choo, choo. Honda. Chota. Chota. Chota. Honda.
[7531.34s -> 7547.58s]  Choo, choo, choo. Choo, choo, choo. Let's get some info here. Okay. He's eating one moth drop.
[7547.58s -> 7554.92s]  I gotta get the moth drops to show up. He never went back to that game. Yeah. Cause I bought like
[7554.92s -> 7562.50s]  a bootleg copy of it and it fucked up. Do I have my sneeze button still? Uh, I don't know. What is
[7562.50s -> 7575.19s]  this one? What's that doing? No, I don't. Actually it's gone. That's sad. All right. Here we go.
[7576.18s -> 7586.54s]  Here come the moth drops. Eat these bells. Hurry, hurry. I'm only 400 pounds. Hurry, feed me,
[7586.54s -> 7611.94s]  feed me more. I'm only 350 pounds. I think that's the, the thing in the arcade from like 20 years
[7611.94s -> 7628.74s]  ago that then you throw the balls in the lady's mouth and she gets fatter. Come on. What? I'm under
[7628.74s -> 7633.45s]  wifi. Something like that. Yeah. All right. Where are the fuck are these moths? Look at, I got
[7633.45s -> 7642.97s]  everything they want right here. You promised me a kitty. I can't unless the kitty decides to come
[7642.97s -> 7649.96s]  over here and eat one of the mice. I'm trying to make the geckos do the gecko dance cause I
[7649.96s -> 7664.94s]  want to see it. Cause that game used to terrify me as a kid. Yeah. It, yeah. It was fucking crazy.
[7665.58s -> 7671.02s]  Check its visit requirements. Yeah. It needs blue. It needs these bells and needs these lights.
[7671.10s -> 7683.54s]  This is nighttime. So where is it? Excuse me. Are you here yet? Moth drop. Eat a blue bell flower.
[7683.54s -> 7705.50s]  Look what's over here. Eat it. Yes. No, wrong image. Uh, yes. This, uh, it's big Bertha.
[7705.50s -> 7709.66s]  And what you would do is you would throw balls into this. There was a little ball thing that was
[7709.66s -> 7716.14s]  underneath down here and it was like the little tray and you had to throw the balls into her mouth
[7716.14s -> 7721.50s]  and there was an inflatable thing underneath where her, where her shirt is. And every time
[7721.50s -> 7733.69s]  you put another ball, a ball went in, it would inflate a little more until a big got huge.
[7733.69s -> 7740.15s]  And, and points were weight. And every time you'd get like two or three, four or five balls in,
[7740.15s -> 7744.86s]  she'd say like, I'm only 200 pounds. I can be much fatter than this. And then it'd be like,
[7744.86s -> 7748.46s]  I'm only, you'd cut it off sometimes. So if you, if you had like three or four friends all doing it
[7748.46s -> 7751.98s]  at the same time that you did, it was like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. It'd be
[7751.98s -> 7757.30s]  like, I'm only, I'm only three. I'm free. I'm 400. I'm only 500 pounds. You can do better.
[7757.30s -> 7762.44s]  And then the timer would run out and then she would laugh. And then you'd put
[7762.44s -> 7768.17s]  25 cents in and you would do it again until you were out of money. And then you'd go buy
[7768.17s -> 7777.74s]  four tootsie rolls at the counter with the tickets you won. Did I get a moth drop yet?
[7777.82s -> 7793.26s]  Bingo. Bingo. Do it. Please. Eat one of these. Eat one. Yeah.
[7808.70s -> 7819.11s]  All right, go. Now we have our resident moth drop. We need another one. And then we can feed
[7819.11s -> 7831.59s]  the geckos. He's still playing piñata. Yeah. I mean, for now, for now. Yeah. And I'm probably
[7831.59s -> 7836.62s]  not going to play this tomorrow. I just want to make a couple more geckos. I'm playing
[7836.62s -> 7849.80s]  Icaruga tomorrow. Oh, they're actually kind of cool looking. He hates the piñata. He hates
[7849.80s -> 7871.16s]  the piñata. No, no. You hate the piñata. You hate the piñata. Not me. These still need to be
[7871.16s -> 7879.58s]  a plant dried out. What? Stop fucking touching this. You're going to get hurt. Come here.
[7884.17s -> 7891.50s]  All right. Now I need another moth drop. You need to eat one of these moth drops, but not yet.
[7891.50s -> 7895.45s]  I need another moth drop, two moth drops. We're going to have moth drops and then we're going to
[7895.45s -> 7901.61s]  have a gecko baby. Why are your lips so red? They're not. They're not. The white balance on
[7901.61s -> 7908.09s]  this camera is tilted to a point where it's all red. My eyes are red though, because I've only
[7908.09s -> 7912.09s]  slept like two or three hours a night for the last five straight days, but that's accurate.
[7916.90s -> 7925.80s]  Patch here. Where am I needed? I'm ready for healing and stuff. That's an exaggeration.
[7925.80s -> 7930.70s]  It's probably been like four. It's probably been like four hours a night, maybe four and a half.
[7930.70s -> 7951.54s]  Oh my God. A liar. It's maybe like three or four plus maybe four and a half or stop streaming and
[7951.54s -> 7964.20s]  go to bed. I'm fine. I'm all right. I've like, I've had four plus hours a night. Oh, there's six,
[7964.20s -> 7982.89s]  six to ten. Turn off the torches, please. The piñatas are burning. Bluebell. Dink, dink, dink.
[7982.89s -> 7996.73s]  All right. I'll turn the torches off. He sleeps 18 hours a day. He'd probably puke. If I slept
[7996.73s -> 8007.72s]  for 18 hours more than, I'd probably throw up. I'd wake up and I'd feel like shit and I'd probably
[8007.72s -> 8019.75s]  puke. Turn around, you bad streamer. Oh, here. Look, I can't, there, I can't do anything about
[8019.75s -> 8036.55s]  this. They have to come eat a mouse. Look, he doesn't even want to come over here. Bad. He
[8036.55s -> 8041.21s]  doesn't want to come over here. He has to eat a mouse mallow. He doesn't want to come over here.
[8041.21s -> 8051.69s]  Buy milk. Oh my God. Go buy milk. Milk, milk, milk, milk, milk, milk, milk, milk, milk. All right,
[8051.69s -> 8057.30s]  get milk. Cats aren't supposed to fucking drink milk. Birds aren't supposed to eat bread.
[8057.86s -> 8073.90s]  This is ridiculous. This is a thousand dollars. Uh, no. Uh, you want to spend a thousand fucking
[8073.90s -> 8090.02s]  dollars on milk. Can I, I can't sell you. You don't, you don't, you don't live here.
[8095.34s -> 8114.60s]  Selling a mouse and selling two mice. No, I'm not. Fuck. I don't, I can't sell anything. I don't
[8114.60s -> 8124.58s]  have any money. Let me do it. I don't. Uh, fine. I'll sell a mouse. Fine. Get back in there and buy
[8124.58s -> 8148.97s]  that milk. It's a thousand dollars. Sell the seeds. Where is he? Where's this weirdo? March
[8148.97s -> 8156.17s]  in there and get that milk. I can't until I have a thousand dollars. There goes the cat. No, no,
[8156.17s -> 8174.39s]  no, no. I want the cat. No. Oh, moth drop. I'm so mad. Look, he's pretending to fly.
[8175.19s -> 8182.55s]  Did you see that? He had his arms out and he has the, the helmet on. Oh yeah. He's mocking us.
[8183.62s -> 8196.07s]  Was I? I don't think, I don't think I was. You won't come here without a surfboard.
[8196.07s -> 8202.44s]  Okay. How about, um, I need to sell. I'm just going to sell.
[8204.36s -> 8210.55s]  Uh, I have to sell a mouse. That's just what's going to have to happen. I'm selling a mouse
[8210.55s -> 8223.67s]  and I'm going to sell a couple of flowers. Make an OnlyFans account. How would I do that?
[8223.67s -> 8231.34s]  Oh, I don't have a reason to do that. I'm selling a mouse. You and I'm going to sell some of these
[8231.34s -> 8257.80s]  flowers. Daisy. All right. I need five, nine, 70, 981. Okay. I can get the milk. I'm not going to
[8257.80s -> 8263.24s]  buy it yet until the cat comes back. I'm supposed to get distracted. I've been distracted for almost
[8263.24s -> 8274.47s]  two and a half straight hours. I've, I've been distracted for as long as a, a like Christopher
[8274.47s -> 8304.34s]  Nolan movie. Okay. So we, I can start to play now. All right. We're looking for more moth drops.
[8304.34s -> 8324.54s]  Turn these on. Back away from this. Back away. Back away. Back away. Back away. You're going to get,
[8325.62s -> 8331.69s]  whatever. Attention. Attention. Look at me. Attention. Okay. Cool.

[8340.79s -> 8350.74s]  This is my favorite of the whole night. I think this is very, very good.
[8368.50s -> 8385.42s]  Any more moth drops. Come eat and then I'll, I can make the geckos breed. This one's better. I
[8385.42s -> 8391.64s]  promise. Oh, that one. Whoa. Wow. That's way better. No, it's just, you, you, it's a smudge tool in
[8391.64s -> 8409.93s]  Photoshop. You. Howdy doody. Howdy doody Hummer. Howdy doody Hummer. Howdy. No, I can't do that.
[8409.93s -> 8419.98s]  That's not, I'm not good enough. If you tuck it. That's different. What's that one? I don't think
[8419.98s -> 8437.43s]  you. Oh, that's like, there's a bit. When my mask gets broken. I can't. How many do you have? All
[8437.43s -> 8442.23s]  right. What is this thing? This is a question mark, question mark, question mark. Mystery seed.
[8443.03s -> 8451.98s]  Let's try it. Where's it? What are you doing to plant it? Just right over here. It's a mystery seed.
[8453.43s -> 8478.18s]  Let's check it out. It is a doesn't go. No. Gooseberry bush. Whatever. Fucking controls.
[8478.18s -> 8486.68s]  Fucking suck. Fucking controls. Stupid fucking controls. Hey, time to silent. Nobody's in my
[8486.68s -> 8492.68s]  room. Be mad at something. The fucking controls are fucking stupid. Dumbest fucking game ever,
[8492.68s -> 8506.06s]  man. Such a fucking stupid game. So fucking stupid. Fucking dumbest fucking thing ever.
[8508.92s -> 8537.30s]  Fucking be in the game. Fucking. What is this? Is it a tree? Dude, it's a hazel tree.
[8537.70s -> 8558.04s]  Hmm. This thing take a lot of water. Nice and this. Um, hello? Look at how much water this shit takes.
[8559.58s -> 8584.94s]  Fuck this. All right. Another one. The show was better than the game. Oh, squazzle. Oh, wait,
[8584.94s -> 8589.78s]  there's a hazelnut tree. That's how you get a squazzle. This game is fucking so bad.
[8591.62s -> 8596.68s]  Why would anyone play this for more than five minutes? It's opposite day. Just kidding.
[8600.22s -> 8607.53s]  Oh, fuck. Is that another one? What is this one? Is that too close? An apple tree. Oh, shit. Nice.
[8607.53s -> 8618.07s]  Is this too close? Actually, that kind of look that look good. That look kind of good.
[8620.09s -> 8625.58s]  All right. What's the mystery one then? Just in case something big. I'll put it over here.
[8626.30s -> 8640.25s]  Something dried out. Where? Oh, this shit takes a ton of water. Oh, gooseberry bush.
[8643.08s -> 8668.65s]  I just walk into fire. These things take so much water. Holy shit. Stop walking into the fire.
[8670.78s -> 8690.31s]  Oh my. Aye. Okay. Well, I know what it looks like now. Big bits. Big bits. Fill this up with
[8690.31s -> 8698.66s]  5,000. 5,000 bits from Titan Claws. 50 bucks. Thanks to the 50 fucking dollars, dude.
[8699.96s -> 8705.66s]  And Titan Claws says, uh, girlfriend of five years broke up with me. Then my father passed
[8705.66s -> 8710.94s]  away unexpectedly two days later. Holy shit. I'm so sorry. The past two and a half weeks have been
[8710.94s -> 8714.06s]  the worst of my life, but your streams and highlights have helped me more than you could
[8714.06s -> 8727.48s]  know. Thank you. I'm really sorry to hear about that shit. That's pretty rough. Back to back
[8727.48s -> 8739.30s]  like that. I can't imagine what you're going through right now. Try to keep your head up.
[8749.37s -> 8755.03s]  Hang in there, buddy. Yeah, for real. Because that's two, that's just two things back to back
[8755.03s -> 8759.59s]  that nobody wants to that shit to happen. Especially like that back to back like that.
[8766.46s -> 8772.52s]  Let's hope when the page turns here, take as long as you need to grieve for all this stuff
[8775.35s -> 8780.82s]  that the page can turn. Thank you so much. It's completely unnecessary to give me this much money.
[8781.85s -> 8795.06s]  Take care of yourself. I wish you the best. Thank you so much. And an award for, oh, did I level up
[8795.06s -> 8808.30s]  finally? It took me like three hours to do that. Come on. Yes. Level 13. In no way unlucky, I hope
[8808.30s -> 8816.47s]  Petula has a new wig and Lottie has three new items to dress up your garden. Most importantly,
[8816.47s -> 8821.43s]  you can buy a new seed packet from Lottie that will give you more options in your garden.
[8821.43s -> 8830.22s]  Because I wasn't doing anything. There it is. How many times do I have to get a shovel upgrade?
[8831.18s -> 8842.92s]  You've reached the stage I got to on my third day. Well done. This makes your shovel stronger.
[8842.92s -> 8848.18s]  So you should be able to deal with some of the more awkward things in your garden. Thanks for
[8848.18s -> 8854.94s]  the info. I don't know what that means. Stupid idiot. Hi, these are all ready. This one needs
[8854.94s -> 8861.00s]  some water properly. Whoo. It's going. It's going. Attention. I'm not gonna say that.
[8863.48s -> 8882.17s]  I know it's drying out. I'm trying. I'm working on it. Happy birthday. Cool. So we have,
[8882.17s -> 8891.61s]  we need to get them off. These ducks are still having fun. Having some fucking fun. Sick. Sell
[8891.61s -> 8901.58s]  you. And buy milk. Screamer. Attention. Buy milk. Buy milk. Milk, milk, milk, milk. You need milk
[8901.58s -> 8911.80s]  for the cat. You need milk for the cat. You need milk for the cat. I know, I know, I know. There's
[8911.80s -> 8938.46s]  no cat in sight. PS2 emulator slow down. Do you guys remember that shit? What game did I play on
[8938.46s -> 8948.18s]  that PS2 emulator? It was that news one, right? Something with the CPU cycling was wrong. And it
[8948.26s -> 8955.75s]  kept going like that. Yeah. What was that? Michigan report from hell. Yeah. Didn't I beat that whole
[8955.75s -> 8972.01s]  game to putting up with all that crap? I was waiting for them to come in. I got the bad ending.
[8972.01s -> 8986.41s]  Whatever. Shit. Where'd that go? I gotta get rid of this. Where is it? It's in here. Get rid of it.
[8987.13s -> 8996.41s]  Stop. I can't even select it. Tell it. Quick. It still needs water. All right. Time to turn
[8996.41s -> 9009.10s]  this shit on. There's Mr. Cidos. Oh, I didn't even plant this. What is this one? Let's see what it
[9009.10s -> 9026.73s]  is. A tree? It is a tree, isn't it? It's a blackberry bush. How much water does it need?
[9027.45s -> 9033.56s]  Or it's too much? That's probably good. That's good. That's good. That's good. All right. Looking
[9033.56s -> 9040.38s]  for the moths. I need another moth. Are you a moth? No, you're an ant. I don't really care about the
[9040.38s -> 9049.38s]  ant. Wait, they want to eat it? I think they want to eat this. Cat. The cat's not here. There's no
[9049.38s -> 9057.30s]  cat. I can't get a cat. Cat has to come on its own when it wants to. There's no cat available. See,
[9057.30s -> 9062.57s]  I looked all around the whole perimeter. No cats. There is. No, there's not. I don't see. There's no
[9062.57s -> 9081.24s]  cat here. That's a fox. What are you doing over there? He's over there. Then find one. All right.
[9081.24s -> 9088.57s]  I will find one. Just attention. 28 minutes remaining until the stream is over. I'll find one.
[9088.57s -> 9097.56s]  I'll just have to... I'll get a... All I have to do is just find... Yeah, I'll get an upgrade for it.
[9097.56s -> 9117.48s]  Thermo monkey has thermo. 28 minutes. Oh, fuck. Is it really? Where are these fucking moths? You
[9117.48s -> 9122.04s]  can't turn the stream off till we have the cat. That's fair. That's, that's fair. No, the stream
[9122.04s -> 9131.86s]  can't turn off till we get the cat and I breed the geckos. That's just the way it is. Where's this
[9131.86s -> 9153.96s]  bat? Attention. Use hunter. I can't use the hunter until I have a resident sleeper. Moth drop. All
[9153.96s -> 9166.50s]  right. There's one. I need another moth drop. Moth drop two. Oh. Yep. Okay. Eat a blue. Eat a
[9166.50s -> 9179.08s]  flower. And then finally I can breed the geckos. Over here. Come over here. Check it out. Can you
[9179.08s -> 9184.70s]  breed the moths? I think I can, but I got to see what it takes to do that. Come on. Come over here
[9184.70s -> 9192.55s]  and eat one of these. Come over here. Come on. I know you want to do it before the time runs out.
[9192.55s -> 9218.79s]  Please. No. Is it leaving? No. No. Don't leave. No. What the fuck? No, please don't test it.
[9218.79s -> 9237.45s]  Badgicle. Didn't we already know this? A badgicle has appeared. The garden has a blackberry bush.
[9237.45s -> 9240.97s]  Then a badgicle won't be far behind. Didn't we already get introduced to a badgicle?
[9242.49s -> 9246.33s]  Eat it. It's going to eat it. Come on. You're right there. Eat it so we can keep this going.
[9246.33s -> 9254.46s]  Please just land on this and eat it. Come on. Do it. Why are you doing this? You're teasing me.
[9254.46s -> 9269.11s]  You must be a chat member. Will you just eat it? Oh my god. Just eat it. You've already
[9269.11s -> 9273.77s]  have to fly around like this. Just eat this and then live here and then I can make a moth house
[9273.77s -> 9280.10s]  and then I can breed you and then we can breed the geckos. Eat that. Eat it. Please just eat it.
[9282.14s -> 9306.02s]  Just eat it. Eat. Weird owl ripoff. That's a weird owl song. I'm singing the weird owl version. That's
[9306.02s -> 9310.90s]  not me singing that. That's a weird owl song. No, it's a Michael Jackson song. That then turned into
[9310.90s -> 9314.98s]  a weird owl song. That then turned into me referencing a weird owl song which references
[9314.98s -> 9334.70s]  the Michael Jackson song. Sorry. I win. Now I can build a moth drop house. Two moth drops.
[9334.70s -> 9341.58s]  Now what does it take for them to breed? Has to eat a hazelnut tree seed. Oh god. Do I just say
[9341.58s -> 9355.91s]  fuck it? Hazelnut tree seed. Somebody just gave 5,000 bits again. Another one. What's with the

[9368.34s -> 9375.22s]  fucking bits. Thanks for the huge amount of money as always. This is an actual important game tip.
[9375.22s -> 9379.53s]  Okay. Thanks for the huge amount of money first of all. Second of all,
[9380.49s -> 9385.37s]  once you breed a species the first time you can just go buy romance candy and feed it to them
[9385.37s -> 9387.93s]  to make them breed again. You don't have to keep feeding them moth drops.
[9390.65s -> 9402.98s]  Wow. Holy shit. Don't dig a pond. Well, thanks for the tip and now let's do that. Okay. So let's um
[9403.54s -> 9427.83s]  you know what I mean? We're gonna look for a seed, right? No seeds are gonna fall. Fuck. Okay. So
[9427.83s -> 9433.67s]  let's do romance candy. Wait. Let me read that again. Once you breed a species for the first
[9433.67s -> 9447.62s]  time. All right. So just eat the moths. Where's my uh geckos? Gecko one. Eat this moth. Gecko two.
[9447.62s -> 9466.52s]  Where's gecko two? Gecko one. Gecko two. Eat moth one and then breed. Where's moth one? All right.

[9515.91s -> 9521.72s]  massively selling. I'm just gonna sell a bunch of marshmallows. They're impeding on my gecko.
[9521.72s -> 9549.05s]  Come here. Go eat this. Eat. Go for it. Got it. Wait. Don't both of you do it. Wait. Can you both
[9549.05s -> 9554.62s]  just eat it together? It just dropped a peanut. Come on. Eat. Maybe they don't have. Maybe I'm
[9554.62s -> 9565.93s]  gonna keep that one moth. Eat this candy. Come on. When? Really? This fucking squirrel is over here.
[9568.22s -> 9586.60s]  Get out of here. It's not yours. Get out of here. It's not your food. All right. Where's moth? That's
[9586.60s -> 9594.17s]  not the right moth. Why do you not live here? Are you? Moth? No. This is not. This is not even the
[9594.17s -> 9600.92s]  right one. Where is this motherfucker? Did somebody help me out here? Where's this other moth drop
[9600.92s -> 9614.31s]  that moved in on the sand building? Oh, I thought that was part of the fucking-
[9615.03s -> 9637.53s]  I thought that was part of the decor- the design. All right. Let's go. Eat. Eat. Eat. Apples and bananas.
[9638.65s -> 9650.41s]  I like to eat. Eat. Eat. Apples and bananas. Oh, all of a sudden, all of a sudden, you do
[9650.41s -> 9658.49s]  baby bop and people fucking want to leave. Wow. Whoa. Unbelievable. You do the fucking
[9658.49s -> 9678.55s]  Barney the Dinosaur character and everybody decides it's time to go now. He's actually mad.
[9679.35s -> 9691.83s]  All right. Let's do it. Are you ready? Did you even eat yet? Eat. Dermot, you should be worried
[9691.83s -> 9703.24s]  about the people that stay. What? He's view pandering. I just started singing the Apples
[9703.24s -> 9706.52s]  and Bananas song from Barney the Dinosaur and then you think that's me pandering views.
[9713.61s -> 9721.22s]  It's time to see what this sex thing is. What are you- are you saying that the audience is like
[9722.65s -> 9738.50s]  10 years old? What is that thing? Sour Profitimel. You have attracted a sour profisimel, I'm sorry.
[9739.06s -> 9745.06s]  Well, just hit him in the head with the fucking hammer, whatever this is. Hit him with the face
[9745.06s -> 9760.36s]  of the shovel. He'll go away. Where is it? Are you guys ready to see the dance of the geckos?
[9761.08s -> 9779.66s]  You ready? This is gonna be sick. Here it comes. We've been waiting two days for this. All right,
[9779.66s -> 9799.86s]  let me see. So we go bottom. I don't know. Who cares? This is really hard to control. It is.
[9799.86s -> 9812.02s]  Trust me when I say that. This is very difficult to control this. It's very, very sloppy. Change
[9812.02s -> 9818.01s]  camera. You can now press the Y button at any time. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[9818.81s -> 9841.77s]  During the time, I'm fine. All right, let's see the dance. Let's go.
[9843.61s -> 9847.16s]  Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out,
[9847.16s -> 9852.38s]  watch out. I gotta get back to the house. Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. She's coming over. Oh my god.
[9852.38s -> 9857.85s]  Oh no, no, no, no, no. I gotta make sure. Is the bed clean? Does the bed smell? Oh fuck. Is there
[9857.85s -> 9864.12s]  trash in my fucking counter? Shit. Yeah, just one second. Throw it on the fucking ground and
[9864.12s -> 9877.98s]  push it in the corner. Where's the Febreze? All right, we're ready. Come on, come on in. Fuck.
[9877.98s -> 9911.11s]  Come on in. I love this one. That was great. That was awesome. I want to see what the duck one is.
[9911.11s -> 9929.13s]  So bad. What about this? Can we see the snake one at least? Egg delivered. Maybe we'll get to see
[9929.13s -> 9946.15s]  the cat one. New seeds. A new pinata is in the desert? A new pinata has been spotted in the
[9946.15s -> 9967.19s]  Keen Arctic. Let's go check it out. Wait, evil. You're my cursed dog PNG.
[9967.27s -> 9972.87s]  At last you have a shovel worthy of a real gardener. There isn't much you can't do with this now.
[9973.67s -> 9979.51s]  See the jagged edge on this shovel? That's so you can cut down any tree that you don't need anymore.
[9981.13s -> 9990.98s]  That's pretty cursed. You're right. Now all we need this to do is we need this to move. So the mouth
[9990.98s -> 9994.42s]  is constantly moving forward and another head's coming out of the mouth. You know what I mean?
[9994.42s -> 9999.16s]  Like those weird images that just keep going forward at you. Or keep going backwards or
[9999.16s -> 10017.54s]  whatever it is. That's a Jojo reference. Oh, sorry. Sorry, I just gave you a Jojo reference.
[10018.26s -> 10023.46s]  I'm waiting for him to come in. He'll come in in a second. Right when you cross that line,
[10023.46s -> 10030.20s]  that's it. That's it. You crossed it. You crossed it. That's the line. You're off sides.
[10036.95s -> 10040.47s]  If only you'd stayed over there, I wouldn't have, I wouldn't have hit you.
[10042.57s -> 10069.22s]  God, fuck. There's another one? What the fuck? This reminds me of a song. I want attention.
[10070.54s -> 10080.41s]  Only 11 minutes remain in the stream. Only 11 minutes remain in the stream. I have no,
[10080.41s -> 10089.24s]  what's wrong? Oh, I got it. My phone just started. Oh, I got a notification. Okay,
[10089.24s -> 10091.72s]  I only have a little bit more time left. I got the notification.
[10098.39s -> 10112.14s]  11. That's it? What the fuck? I thought I had more time than that. That's weird.
[10112.94s -> 10119.08s]  All right. Oh, what was I doing? I need that cat. A cat has to show up. Wait, isn't that a cat?
[10119.64s -> 10123.22s]  This is a cat. This is your cat right here. No, it's not.
[10127.35s -> 10147.48s]  Ooh, apples. He's not selfish very much. Just keep him. Hazelnut seed. Who wants one of these?
[10148.68s -> 10169.45s]  Oh, there he is. He's so cute. Put a hat on Gekki. Yup. On a little Gekki. Absolutely. Whoa.
[10169.45s -> 10192.62s]  Fucking holy shit. Can I put it on? Do they have to be an adult? Yeah, they have to be an adult.
[10193.26s -> 10215.48s]  Okay, what about for a hat? Anymore? Oh, there's new stuff. Hold on. I mean, perfect. Fireman,
[10215.48s -> 10232.63s]  right? Ooh, football helmet. Hmm. I think I want the bonnet. Or the fire helmet. Yeah, that's
[10232.63s -> 10250.50s]  perfect. I love it. I love the eyes. Superhero mask. Eh. Eh. Nah. Nose. A gas mask? That doesn't even
[10250.50s -> 10271.08s]  fit on his face. There's nothing more than these teeth. Funky. Ooh, a tie. Or a spiked collar. Okay,
[10271.08s -> 10290.17s]  the collar is kind of cool. Or the tie. So I like the tie. Collar is cool too. I like the collar.
[10290.25s -> 10306.18s]  Sweat bands. What about shoes? Yep. But all of his feet are on the ground. All right, I like it.
[10306.18s -> 10315.00s]  We're good. Yeah, selling's good. Means you do most of the work. Won't say bye because-
[10315.00s -> 10323.14s]  Put a tie on the duck. Yup. Couldn't have thought of anything more perfect than what you just said.
[10324.55s -> 10331.37s]  New resident. A taffy? When did I get a taffy? What? I need a taffy. What do I need this taffy?
[10331.37s -> 10339.90s]  Somebody has to eat this, right? I think, what, a snake? Who eats the taffy? Burn it. Set the
[10339.90s -> 10370.57s]  taffy on fire. Come here. Do it. Do it. Touch it. Touch it. Touch it. Look at him. Oh no, I'm the
[10370.57s -> 10392.79s]  fireman. I'll put you out. When do I have to, when do I put it out? There we go. There it is. A super
[10392.79s -> 10406.62s]  taffy. Evil candy? A ruffian is on the way. Oh no, a ruffian is on the way. They're experts
[10406.62s -> 10424.66s]  in spiteful destructive behavior. Okay, now sell. For 2,200 bucks. Done. Okay, now,
[10425.54s -> 10443.08s]  hey, uh, hit him. I gotta hit him with the shovel. Um, I can't even hit him. I can't hit him. He just
[10443.08s -> 10446.12s]  throws up a candy and leaves. What is it? I think there's a candy. I think I know what that candy
[10446.12s -> 10458.09s]  might do. 5,000 more bits from Filashulich. Holy shit. Another 50 fucking dollars. Feed a gooseberry
[10458.09s -> 10467.45s]  to a duck for a special surprise. Yeah, but what does it do? Oh, thanks for the 100 bucks.
[10468.54s -> 10479.96s]  Feed a gooseberry to a duck. Okay, let me, I'll do it. Do I get a super duck? All right, here's
[10479.96s -> 10513.46s]  a gooseberry. Hey, you. Not into it? Not into it? Not into it? Yeah, that was blackberries. Oh,
[10514.79s -> 10529.05s]  was it gooseberry? I gotta look at all this fruit. Okay, gooseberry. You.
[10529.85s -> 10548.14s]  Eat that gooseberry right there. What does it do? Oh, it turns up in a squidward.
[10560.81s -> 10570.76s]  God damn it. You know, there are some people like myself who can help you with your more mundane
[10570.76s -> 10576.22s]  tasks. For example, you should let a springling like me come water your plants for you. Oh,
[10576.22s -> 10581.83s]  you do work for me. Good. But I'm worth it. You can find me an arfer in here if you want to take me
[10581.83s -> 10596.41s]  arfer. No doubt. How many people live in this town? Seriously? Hello. If you have problems with
[10596.41s -> 10601.45s]  garden visitors, we can make sure that only guests on the list get in. I'm just going to have a
[10601.45s -> 10610.09s]  couple of drinks and I'll be ready for work. Welcome to level 16. This level has a new helper
[10610.09s -> 10616.17s]  to make life easier. Lottie has some very special fencing, a new item, and a-
[10616.17s -> 10626.44s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I can buy the surfboard now.
[10627.56s -> 10633.72s]  But I don't have a duck. I have a duck and like a juicy duck. They can't- can they breed together?
[10633.72s -> 10646.58s]  Can I do that? Does it have to be duck and duck or can it be duck and juicy duck? Can I do that?
[10646.58s -> 10660.97s]  No, I can't. It's got to be duck and duck. And now there's no other- just buy a duck.
[10660.97s -> 10669.13s]  Should I sell juicy duck? That's a lot of money. But does juicy duck sleep in the same house
[10669.13s -> 10683.61s]  as regular duck or do they need a juicy duck house? This is- no, okay. All right, I'm gonna
[10683.61s -> 10693.80s]  buy a duck and then I'm gonna buy- okay, I have some things to buy. I need- I'm gonna buy another
[10693.88s -> 10706.76s]  duck. It says goose. Goose. Okay, where's duck? $2,000 fucking dollars for express delivery.
[10706.76s -> 10713.11s]  Get the fuck out of here. Come on, man. Standard delivery. Yeah, thank you.
[10720.78s -> 10730.20s]  You're leveled up. I know. We're looking for- we have the- all right, I think it's time- I
[10730.20s -> 10735.40s]  can throw this- I can- I can cannon this Gekki, right? I think it's time to cannon the Gekki.
[10735.96s -> 10752.09s]  Because I already- I have two. He's gonna go to the- have a party. Yeah, we haven't done this yet,
[10752.09s -> 10755.61s]  so we'll be able to send him to the party. Yeah, we're gonna get a lot of experience for this.
[10758.89s -> 10772.44s]  Fire him away. Reward for sending to a party. Yes, more, more, more. Level 17? Where's my pop-up
[10772.44s -> 10783.46s]  window for 17? Juicy goose. Gekki 1 is ready for liftoff as well. Should we send Gekki 1 to the
[10783.46s -> 10811.58s]  party? They come back, right? They come back. They come back. Send to the party. No, they come back.
[10811.58s -> 10829.37s]  They're just going to the party. I'm gonna do- I'm gonna sell these things. Sell. Sell. No, don't sell
[10829.37s -> 10853.59s]  this. Okay, sell. They do come back. Going to the party means you get your guts- what? Anytime
[10853.59s -> 10857.75s]  these things are within two or three pixels of each other, or like 200 or whatever they are,
[10858.23s -> 10864.90s]  it's so hard to select anything. There's napping in the game, and it just- it's very- it's wonky.
[10868.52s -> 10877.77s]  Cat alert. Milk time. I did promise before the stream ended that I was gonna go get a cat.
[10877.77s -> 10893.56s]  Attention. Chat has detected cat. Milk. No, milk is not a vegetable. Milk is not a vegetable,
[10893.56s -> 10907.08s]  as much as the American food pyramid would like for you to know and believe. Bone. 14 fucking
[10907.08s -> 10948.86s]  hundred. This is so much money. You- I hope you like this. Get rid of this shit. Hey, fuck. Get
[10948.86s -> 10968.90s]  out of here. Don't- Juicy goose. Don't eat that food. It's bad for you. Do not eat that food.
[10968.90s -> 10974.42s]  Leave it alone. Don't touch it. Nobody touch this food. It's bad. Poisonous. What is this, a mushroom?
[10974.42s -> 10999.75s]  What is this? Is this live? Oh, I don't know what it was. Okay, now these apples. Who needs to eat
[10999.75s -> 11005.96s]  one of these? Somebody has to eat one of these. Where's my duck? I need a crab too. I need a
[11005.96s -> 11030.18s]  surfboard. Fuck. Okay, surfboard. Boys. Boys. No, there's woo-too train and woo-woo train. There's
[11030.18s -> 11052.06s]  no- What do I get it? Garden item? Surfboard. There we go. All right, good. Now I can bring crabs in.
[11056.30s -> 11085.10s]  Evil bat. I know. I see him. Go to the desert? I will after I get rid of evil bats. So I have
[11085.66s -> 11093.58s]  two apples that I think I can- Attention. You have over five minutes of your eluded
[11093.58s -> 11100.55s]  minutes allowed on stream. Each minute after this momentary interruption will cost the streamer
[11100.55s -> 11113.78s]  $15 per minute. The clock is still here though. That should be fine. Got to text. I don't know
[11113.78s -> 11116.98s]  who's texting me right now, but I'm getting noticed. I don't want to fucking even see it.
[11116.98s -> 11146.95s]  I'm streaming. What the fuck? Where's a cat? Where's a crab? Oh, a duck. Fred, we're gonna- Oh,
[11146.95s -> 11171.93s]  come here. Hey, come here. Make more goose. I can do two goose. The bread's in the water.
[11171.93s -> 11191.62s]  Does it matter? I have another- My delivery is ready, right? Oh, super goose. Geese. It's geese.
[11191.62s -> 11214.07s]  I know. There's a quackberry. Where? Collect? Yeah. Thank you. All right. Nope.
[11216.87s -> 11223.59s]  Omega lol, two goose. Omega lol, two goose. I mean, you get it. Did you eat that bread yet?
[11224.15s -> 11251.02s]  You didn't. Why? What am I doing? I'm waiting to tame a cat and I'm waiting for a crab to show up.
[11252.04s -> 11266.17s]  When a crab shows up, I can breed the ducks, play Lisa the Painful. What on earth? What? All right,
[11266.17s -> 11271.70s]  we're gonna get the camera off of this one. I probably will never play Lisa the Painful on this
[11271.70s -> 11287.82s]  stream. I've got to make all these statements today. No, I said probably. All right, I said
[11287.82s -> 11293.50s]  probably. I gotta fix that. I will never play Lisa the Painful on this stream.
[11294.22s -> 11307.38s]  There you go. I have to- Sometimes you gotta just pull the bandaid off. Go to the desert or riot.
[11309.24s -> 11329.43s]  I'd like to see you try. I don't see anything new. I see Chadbird. I see everything that I've seen
[11329.43s -> 11352.06s]  already. Where's the new pinata? The box. The box. What box? They were telling you to play desert
[11352.06s -> 11358.50s]  bus, not go to the desert. I already did play desert bus and I gave up after about 15 minutes.
[11359.06s -> 11362.82s]  I did desert bus vr and I was like, oh, this is kind of- I'm done.
[11364.50s -> 11392.92s]  Wait, let's really reload the area. Why won't you play Lisa the Painful? Because I don't want to.
[11392.92s -> 11399.18s]  I don't want to play that on stream. I don't- I'm not gonna. That's all the reason I need.
[11400.54s -> 11404.62s]  I have to give you like a written essay as to why I'm not going to play Lisa the Painful on
[11404.62s -> 11436.14s]  this stream. Is that my homework for next time? Wait, nope. Go to the Arctic. Lisa's like Dark
[11436.14s -> 11443.32s]  Souls though. No, it's not. It's not. It's like an RPG. Like a top down. It is not. Yeah,
[11443.32s -> 11456.22s]  nice try though. That could- you would have got me to play. Oh, penguins! It isn't top down.
[11456.78s -> 11465.67s]  My whole world is upside down. Pengum. I kind of wish I'd, you know, made a-
[11468.55s -> 11471.03s]  Really wish I made a kind of an ice place.
[11471.51s -> 11483.54s]  What are you doing here? What should I bring? Will a penguin be able to exist in my land?
[11484.18s -> 11487.53s]  Maybe I should get him. All right, let's get him.
[11496.66s -> 11514.15s]  All right, what is he like? Something hot. Something hot. All right, I can do- how about a-
[11514.15s -> 11532.60s]  is it holly berry? What's hot? Is a holly berry hot? Is this hot? No! Hey! Get out.
[11533.45s -> 11559.13s]  You idiot. And now they're running away. Just- where's- where you gonna crab? Juicy duck having
[11559.13s -> 11576.65s]  a fun time? Seed guy? Come here. Gold. Gold's more valuable. Gold is. I'm just saying something
[11576.65s -> 11599.70s]  that's stupid. Is this a yam? Fear tree? Punish him with a shovel? No. You guys are twisted.
[11600.26s -> 11608.60s]  You guys are twisted. You guys are so fucking twisted. I can plant some more of these trees.
[11608.60s -> 11624.38s]  Uh, how about over here? I'll do some more of these trees. Why not? They look nice. Cat? Well,
[11624.38s -> 11631.13s]  there's milk just sitting there. Look, I can't- what- what's that I was saying? You can- you
[11631.13s -> 11646.95s]  can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink. What do you want me to do? Stop being so
[11646.95s -> 11654.49s]  cool and go over here. Get over here! Come visit me! Hurry! Look what I have for you!
[11656.65s -> 11675.22s]  He just stomped all over it! Got it! Okay, and now we eat. What did you just eat? He just ate
[11675.22s -> 11701.32s]  something. Mouse. You. You're on the menu. Come on! A new taffly resident. No, you just drank my
[11701.32s -> 11720.78s]  milk and you're fucking off? That was $1,400, man. You smug bastard. All right, well, how do I- I
[11720.78s -> 11748.90s]  want cats to do this shit in real life. Yes, they do. Okay, is there another fad seed here?
[11751.80s -> 11757.48s]  Okay, we're good. Fill this fucking hole. How do I- what's the requirement to get a frog to show up?
[11757.48s -> 11775.06s]  And why have I not seen any crabs in two fucking hours of game time? Oh, 3.17 hours of game time.
[11775.06s -> 11789.00s]  Shit, you're right. I want to plant these. Jerma, it's time for bed. Uh, you know, you're actually
[11789.00s -> 11799.21s]  right. It is. Thanks for reminding me. I gotta get off this computer soon. Very soon here. You're
[11799.21s -> 11804.50s]  right. No, you're right, guys. You're right. How do I plant this? What the hell even is this thing?
[11804.50s -> 11813.80s]  Where do- I can't plant this anywhere. What is this? Hazelnut. Oh, it's- I can't plant it. It's
[11813.80s -> 11824.09s]  just the nut. It's just the hazelnut. All right, where's that goddamn cat? And no crabs either.
[11829.42s -> 11837.62s]  Unbelievable. Where are the crabs? The same crab showed up five times. And now that there's a surf
[11837.62s -> 11844.42s]  board here, he doesn't want to show up ever again. And we got him. We got him. There he is. Get over
[11844.42s -> 11863.61s]  here, ladies and gentlemen. We got him. I didn't even mean to do that. Is he eating the apple?
[11864.49s -> 11874.81s]  Okay, everyone inside. Come on over here. That's a gamer meme. I don't want to. Everything is here
[11874.81s -> 11882.07s]  that you want. Everything is here that you like. Come spend eternity here. You just have to cross
[11882.07s -> 11888.02s]  that line. Just cross that white line. And you will- you and I will be friends forever.
[11889.46s -> 11898.76s]  You can do it. Just cross that line. Paradise. Water. Sand. There's a cool surfboard. Just walk
[11898.76s -> 11907.16s]  over that line. That's all you need to do. Just cross the line. And there you go. Your signature
[11907.16s -> 11923.83s]  is right here now. Excellent signature. Yes. Yes, it's very nice. Welcome. Welcome. Now stay.
[11924.97s -> 11933.11s]  No, no, no. You can- you don't- Why is he leaving?
[11942.06s -> 11962.12s]  He doesn't like the juicy duck. Okay. Well, at least you'll come over here. Eat a taffy.
[11962.12s -> 11981.85s]  Taffy. Eat it. Second frog. Yeah. Second frog. Incoming. A crow. I kind of want one of these,
[11981.85s -> 11990.25s]  as a friend. You need a dock patch on speed dial? All right. Eat this and then we can have a
[11990.25s -> 12007.66s]  frog dance. I- Where's that cat? Seriously. Oh, look. Instant money. The piñata is ill.
[12008.38s -> 12024.42s]  What is this guy? Sweet tooth. Oh, they're so cool. It's like a beaver. I gotta get this dude.
[12027.98s -> 12037.26s]  Wait, what's wrong? Who's somebody sick over here? Oh, no. Taffy ate some bad candy. No.
[12042.86s -> 12061.83s]  He ate rotten candy. What do I do? He's dying. What the hell on earth? How do I help him? Call
[12061.83s -> 12081.19s]  the doctor quick. Please help him. All right. Get in here. The two frogs. Okay. Romance time.
[12081.19s -> 12085.82s]  What do I need for them to romance? Green flutterscotch. Good fucking luck trying to
[12085.82s -> 12094.15s]  figure that out. Will you get in here? This cat doesn't give a shit. All right. What do you want?
[12094.15s -> 12102.82s]  Three fur cones. Okay. I got those. Right? I have a fur tree. What do I plant? Where's the fur tree?
[12104.47s -> 12122.82s]  Where the fuck is the tree? I just planted one. Did I just plant one of these? He's good. He's good.
[12122.82s -> 12134.22s]  Where did I plant that fur tree? This is the right there. Holy fuck. This thing's dying.
[12134.22s -> 12149.58s]  He ran him over with his car. See, he's back to normal. Flying around. Having a good time.
[12150.14s -> 12167.94s]  I need cones. Can I knock some cones down yet? All right. Just plant this shit. Fuck digging. Who
[12167.94s -> 12194.14s]  cares? And we're gonna eat these. He's lazy. Yes, I am. Just go in the water. Go in the water. Go
[12194.14s -> 12198.94s]  in the water. Go in the water. In the water. Get in the water. Stop flying away and get in the...
[12198.94s -> 12203.54s]  I can't even put you out. I can't put you out. Get to fly in the water, man. Into the water.
[12203.54s -> 12209.38s]  Fly in the water. Fly in the water. Into the water. Into the water. Get in the water. You're
[12209.38s -> 12220.71s]  gonna die. Go in the water. Are you drinking? Get... Okay. You're good. Oh, I want to do some more
[12220.71s -> 12231.24s]  dressing. I want to do some more dressing up. This is moldy bread in the water. Fuck. All right.
[12231.24s -> 12236.12s]  We're gonna make you look absolutely fucking wonderful. What plant dried out?
[12238.94s -> 12264.30s]  Oh, will you fuck off? Is there... What plant dried out? Marshmallow three is very unhappy. Well,
[12264.30s -> 12270.82s]  Marshmallow three is going to be food very, very soon. So, um, I'm sorry, but that's just the way

[14729.67s -> 14733.11s]  uh you're referring to young soy which is kim's
[14733.11s -> 14739.54s]  cat or it was kim's cat until it was given to one of her friends because we
[14739.54s -> 14743.86s]  moved and uh didn't really have the opportunity
[14743.86s -> 14759.40s]  to bring the cat to las vegas and originally
[14759.40s -> 14768.76s]  that was kim's kim sort of got young soy it was sort of
[14768.76s -> 14772.28s]  i think from my understanding it was she was taking care of
[14772.28s -> 14779.11s]  that cat temporarily because that was not really hers to begin with i guess it
[14779.11s -> 14782.79s]  was like a stray and she was just doing her best to take
[14782.79s -> 14786.79s]  care of the cat until i figured out what we were going to do
[14786.79s -> 14803.18s]  would you ever want a cat i've had lots of cats before
[14803.18s -> 14807.26s]  my family had at least six five or six of them
