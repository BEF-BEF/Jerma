[1.78s -> 12.73s]  Hey, sorry I didn't start. Sorry, I got lost in the mail, you know. I thought I could get
[12.73s -> 20.34s]  myself shipped here in a timely manner, but I got lost in the fucking mail. Look at this.
[23.13s -> 28.66s]  But I bid you hello. Hope you had a good couple of days, three days here.
[30.18s -> 37.32s]  Speaking of three days, we are going to do three days. That's one, two, three, in a row
[38.22s -> 47.18s]  of virtual reality. We're going to start today with Mind Show. If you don't know what Mind Show is,
[47.90s -> 55.29s]  well, I'll tell you. You get in that headset and you act out scenes from movies that you
[55.29s -> 64.97s]  make in your mind. I'm going to show you guys some of my acting chops. What's wrong with my
[64.97s -> 72.44s]  desk? No, no, no, no, no. What is this? Why is there like goo on this desk? I use coasters
[72.44s -> 85.80s]  every time. I need to get like a desk cleaner. Oh, that sucks. What is this? I'm not happy about
[85.80s -> 94.31s]  that. Someone's in fucking deep shit. I don't know who did that. They're in deep fucking shit,
[94.31s -> 106.25s]  though. Let's see who comes in this room. Me. Anybody else come in this room? No, just me.
[107.05s -> 112.84s]  You're in big trouble. I'm sorry, I didn't need to not use a coaster. Use a coaster
[112.84s -> 124.50s]  next time, every time. Not next time, every time. No, not the top row. Anyways, let's turn
[124.50s -> 130.65s]  the camera on. You want to? No, not yet. I don't like that. I don't want to be on camera yet.
[130.65s -> 139.46s]  Not until I've had my coffee because I have to finish it. You know what? Fine, fuck it. Let's
[139.46s -> 152.04s]  just get on camera. That like, that like ultra gamer hunch. Did you see that? That was
[152.04s -> 156.44s]  almost like I was, somebody was holding me up by my neck like this, like pinching, like
[158.02s -> 161.94s]  that. Twitch TV. I got Twitch shirt on today. Just in case you didn't know where you were.
[162.66s -> 170.63s]  That's all right. I got, I got the influencer shirt on. The thing is though, it's incredibly
[170.63s -> 177.21s]  light. So it allows me to go like this. I had to prepare for this stream. Guys,
[177.21s -> 182.58s]  I've been walking. I've been taking walks to prepare for this day. Remember last time I
[182.58s -> 190.34s]  streamed VR? I was, I kept going like this, like, no, I, I've been like moving.
[192.06s -> 198.55s]  It's been great. I've been taking like a 40 minute walk every day. I'm dead serious. That's
[198.55s -> 202.95s]  not a joke. This is not one of those scenarios where like Jeremy says something completely
[202.95s -> 210.73s]  fucking untrue. And then we laugh about it in 40 minutes. No, I'm staying active. Get active.
[213.67s -> 223.80s]  Facial hair? Yeah. I mean, I just, I just didn't care. I was thinking, here's the thing.
[223.80s -> 231.64s]  I don't, help me out here. How many of you guys hate the way that you look with a freshly
[231.64s -> 240.33s]  shaved face? I hate it. I need like two days after shaving before I'm happy with what's
[240.33s -> 246.60s]  going on up here. I don't like it. So what happens is I, I know that I have to shave,
[246.60s -> 253.72s]  but I know that if I shave, I'm going to get that weird like crystal face. I don't like it.
[254.36s -> 259.08s]  So I usually try to wait like a day or two and then it's been like four days and then
[259.08s -> 267.05s]  four days turns into five and then it gets hard to do. Just trim it. No, I have an ugly
[267.05s -> 272.49s]  fucking beard. Look at this. Like this is, I grow facial hair here and like here and then
[272.49s -> 285.82s]  here. I don't grow facial hair here. It just looks like coal. Shaggy. Yeah, it doesn't look
[285.82s -> 292.22s]  good. I know people that can grow big thick beards up here. No, not me. I'm lucky if I
[292.22s -> 295.02s]  get, and if you look up close, I'm not going to do it because some people might be eating.
[295.02s -> 300.22s]  So I'm not going to do that. But up close, see from here, this is, oh, he's just got like a
[300.22s -> 306.38s]  little beard today. If I go up close, you can see every individual disgusting hair and I know
[306.38s -> 312.87s]  some of you, I probably snack it. So I don't want to make you throw up. Anyways, why don't
[312.87s -> 316.95s]  we go ahead and get this started? I've been here long enough. Let me just, hold on. I got
[316.95s -> 326.94s]  to finish my coffee. Let me get this dog mug. You want to see it? You really want to see
[326.94s -> 335.27s]  this? All right, fine. Let me, I'm going to be fair warning. If you've got like a ballamaze in
[335.27s -> 340.81s]  front of you, put the fork down, get the bib off and just go like this. You don't want to see
[340.81s -> 367.83s]  this. You see? This looks like I glued on hair on my face. See what I'm talking about?
[369.88s -> 375.24s]  It looks like I went to the barber, right? I went to like the hair salon and like I'm
[375.24s -> 379.48s]  just like crawling on the ground. They're like cutting people's hair and I'm just like
[379.48s -> 382.76s]  picking up pieces and going like, oh, that's a good one. I like put that in my pocket
[383.32s -> 388.55s]  and then I get home and I like glue them on. It doesn't, it doesn't, it's all right.
[392.49s -> 400.38s]  He's covering the zit. No, I was stretching my, look, there's two there. I'm a human,
[400.38s -> 404.70s]  okay? Some people want to pretend that they don't look like shit sometimes. I'm a human.
[406.30s -> 410.94s]  Humans look like shit. That's just the way it is, all right? So for those of you that
[410.94s -> 415.98s]  have trouble seeing a guy with like a pimple right here, humans are gross. That's all you
[415.98s -> 429.83s]  need to know. Do you have any gross things your body does on a daily basis? All right,
[429.83s -> 435.19s]  no, no, no, let's go. Let's go. I'm done with this shit. I'm picking up my VR headset. I
[435.19s -> 440.92s]  don't want to be like, I gotta like get started. I don't want to talk about every
[440.92s -> 446.76s]  gross thing that we do. Saliva, think about it. Inside of your mouth right now
[446.76s -> 452.22s]  is a viscous liquid that is never ending and always is produced. That's disgusting.
[452.22s -> 457.59s]  It's gross. When are we going to get the ability to like sap the DNA from trees?
[458.47s -> 461.27s]  And I just want to become a tree person. I actually was talking to Kim about this two
[461.27s -> 466.98s]  days ago so she can bounce for it. I probably swear to God. I was talking about trees and
[466.98s -> 473.85s]  how like I want to be like a tree. You had to be there, all right? You had to be there
[474.41s -> 493.05s]  because trees don't have like, oh fucking nerd neck. Anyways, here we go. Let's get in
[493.05s -> 498.20s]  here. I gotta get, hold on, let me get these on first. Is this the right, is this the right
[498.20s -> 511.16s]  hand? I don't know. No, okay, this is right because you guys are on the left. We were
[511.16s -> 514.84s]  talking about, I can't even explain it. That's a very, that's for like a Monster
[514.84s -> 518.44s]  Rancher type stream, all right? Let's talk for 40 minutes on how I wish I could be a tree.
[519.40s -> 528.58s]  That's the title of a book. Are we sure that like Shel Silverstein didn't write this
[528.58s -> 540.33s]  poem? I think he may have. I really think that exists. All right, is this going to work?
[540.33s -> 544.73s]  What's going on here? All right, I'm going in. This is Mind Show. Can you guys hear this?
[545.53s -> 555.13s]  I hope so. You can still let me know. It's been a while. So give me a break. I don't know.
[555.13s -> 560.79s]  Never mind. I was going to say never mind. I'm all over the place today but that's probably
[560.79s -> 569.50s]  a good thing. I'm happy. It's a happy day. Oh, and before we get started, I want to show
[569.50s -> 582.84s]  you this. This came out of my faucet. Is this okay to drink? This came out of my,
[582.92s -> 610.36s]  out of the tap. Is that okay? It's a fucking lemonade relax. Here we go. Yes, I know I'm
[610.36s -> 615.40s]  stalling and I'm going to continue to stall because you know how fucking bad I get in here.
[617.22s -> 629.88s]  My like life flashes before my eyes after two hours in VR. Oh, I just three stoogesed myself.
[629.88s -> 641.74s]  God damn it. Hey Larry, come here you chump. Give me a break. Oh, there you guys are.
[645.32s -> 651.29s]  No sound. I don't think there is sound right now. All right, so I'm in the right spot, right?
[651.29s -> 657.96s]  Can you hear that? Now let's do a vocal warm up. Read this card at a normal volume.
[658.60s -> 681.38s]  Do robots have butts? Uh oh. Great. Now you're ready to play. All right, it worked.
[682.52s -> 689.32s]  Point and pull the trigger to start. So my show is what you'll see.
[690.12s -> 696.12s]  Hey there. Welcome to my show where you can remix and share crazy animated shows.
[696.12s -> 699.80s]  Let's watch a show and learn how to remix and share. Okay.
[711.99s -> 719.93s]  Easy. Great. Now your turn. Hit remix to start remixing. Is that the remix button?
[721.42s -> 724.86s]  Remix. Point at the alien and pull the trigger to hop in.
[725.90s -> 734.28s]  That's you now. You're an alien. Get comfortable. So I'm the alien now. How do I record?
[735.24s -> 739.08s]  Now you're ready to record. Try talking to yourself in the mirror. Make something up.
[739.08s -> 764.78s]  When you're ready, click record. How do I click record? Oh, right. You can do this today.
[765.42s -> 769.18s]  You're going to go out there and you're going to show everybody what you're made of.
[769.98s -> 775.03s]  You're going to show everybody what you're capable of. Not what anybody else is,
[775.03s -> 780.23s]  what you are. You have what it takes. You're in that. Now click play to watch what you did.
[799.27s -> 801.83s]  Now you're ready for something a little more intense.
[802.39s -> 805.59s]  That's too quiet. I'll turn it up. I'll turn it up.
[821.74s -> 828.66s]  Looks like this show could use a remix. Click remix to start remixing. I'm the alien.
[830.42s -> 835.46s]  Now point at the alien and pull the trigger to hop in. All you got to do is react to the
[835.46s -> 840.34s]  other character. Don't forget to use your body and your voice. When you're ready, click record.
[841.62s -> 843.94s]  All right. So I got to get a good scene here. All right. I think I'm ready.
[848.84s -> 853.11s]  Hey, hey, hey. You buying my girl a drink at the bar?
[857.03s -> 861.67s]  Don't you ever look at my girl again. That was quite a performance.
[861.67s -> 867.58s]  Let's watch back your remix. Where is the bar? There is no bar here.
[870.25s -> 875.37s]  Great. You just did your first remix. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. I want to
[881.78s -> 886.90s]  let's talk about this. Not sure about sharing. You can always hop back in and redo your
[886.90s -> 897.06s]  record. I want to play it again. Let's talk about this.
[902.18s -> 908.82s]  It's terrible. Why didn't it pick up the thing I said? Share to stream?
[909.62s -> 925.64s]  Click here to share. I don't want to share that. Who's that on the screen? What does that mean?
[926.68s -> 932.92s]  Congratulations. You just shared your first remix. Now let's check out what some other folks did
[932.92s -> 946.09s]  with the same show. What's with my voice?
[946.49s -> 951.66s]  This hot new religion. Come on. Come on. Why is my voice so fucked up?
[951.66s -> 954.94s]  It doesn't even understand why am I.
[959.77s -> 960.33s]  How do I do that?
[966.73s -> 970.09s]  Oh, there is a giant. If you like a show, hit the heart button on your hand.
[970.09s -> 972.57s]  That'll send some love to the person that created it.
[974.92s -> 980.04s]  Daniel's remix called to follow. Well, I don't want to follow anybody.
[980.84s -> 986.68s]  Oh, that was wild. Personally, I liked yours the best. When this show ends, you're taking
[986.68s -> 991.56s]  to the home space. Try following a few folks by pointing at their picture and holding down
[991.56s -> 997.24s]  the trigger. After that, click on the games tab and play a game. All right. I'm ready to
[997.24s -> 1007.26s]  make a show. Star Wars episode seven. I mean, nine. Why am I screaming? I feel like,
[1007.26s -> 1012.38s]  okay, this is weird. I feel like when I'm inside the helmet, I have to be louder.
[1012.94s -> 1019.77s]  I don't understand why that is. All right. What am I doing? Games, play stream, stream
[1019.77s -> 1031.85s]  games, holiday party, part one. You can't like you contribute to these holiday party.
[1031.85s -> 1042.92s]  Which one do you want to contribute to? Get in part three. All right. Let's contribute
[1042.92s -> 1056.06s]  to this one. This is a holiday party. Just play along with the scene. Don't
[1056.06s -> 1068.49s]  forget to use your voice. Here we go. What? Hey, what's happening? What? The party's
[1068.49s -> 1075.75s]  canceled? Unbelievable. That's stupid. We pay $40 to cover. I don't know how to get back.
[1076.31s -> 1088.78s]  Then we have to go through the portal. You want me to hit him? I'll hit him. I'll punch
[1088.78s -> 1096.01s]  him in the face as hard as I can. Let's go. Ready? Share your show. I don't want
[1096.01s -> 1107.03s]  to share that. That sucked. That's my voice. It's canceled. That's stupid. Yeah. Sorry
[1107.03s -> 1115.77s]  about that. I don't know. You know how to get back? Yeah. Problem. That portal's
[1115.77s -> 1119.85s]  only a one way portal. You're kidding. These blocks can help you. You want to
[1119.85s -> 1124.71s]  try that? You want me to hit him? I'll hit him. I'll punch him in the face as
[1124.71s -> 1132.55s]  hard as I can. Let's go. Okay. I didn't think my voice. How do I make my voice
[1132.55s -> 1139.24s]  different? I'm not sharing that one. Fine. I will. That was just me talking as
[1139.24s -> 1151.54s]  me. All right. Get me back here. All right. What about Hungry for Veggies?
[1151.54s -> 1156.02s]  I'm just like, I'm ruined. Okay. I'm just ruining other people's shows. Is
[1156.02s -> 1159.54s]  that what this is? Hungry for Veggies. Do I have to pretend to be like
[1160.50s -> 1174.09s]  Hungry for Veggies. Part one? Why are these clocks on? Oh, okay. I see. It's
[1174.09s -> 1181.42s]  downloading. We'll do part one. I need to change my voice too. Otherwise, it's
[1181.42s -> 1187.18s]  just like Jerma985, the fucking loser. It's my voice. It's just me. No,
[1187.18s -> 1193.24s]  I'm going to be like monsters and shit. All right. Here we go.
[1193.24s -> 1197.88s]  Just play along with the scene. Don't forget to use your voice. Here we
[1197.88s -> 1206.98s]  go. Grandpa. What are you going to do during the holidays? I'm going to
[1207.06s -> 1215.43s]  visit you and hug you. That's what we do here today. You and me. That's
[1215.43s -> 1219.51s]  interesting. I'm just going to chill out here in the fridge. Do you have any
[1219.51s -> 1225.27s]  cookies? You guys, they're planning on eating us. What? Oh no, what am I
[1225.27s -> 1238.76s]  going to do? Now share your show. I'm sorry. I was so...
[1238.76s -> 1240.76s]  I was so...
[1241.64s -> 1245.40s]  Italics! Italics, don't worry. Don't call the police. I'm fine.
[1251.74s -> 1255.02s]  I'm going to visit you and hug you. That's what we do here today.
[1255.66s -> 1262.20s]  You and me. That's so awkward. That's interesting. I'm just going to
[1262.20s -> 1267.40s]  chill out here in the fridge. Do you have any cookies? You guys, they're
[1267.40s -> 1284.70s]  planning on eating us. What? Oh no, what am I going to do? Why would
[1284.70s -> 1288.92s]  you stop screaming there? You know what I mean? Can we show that
[1288.92s -> 1294.23s]  again? How do I move the camera? What are you going to do during the
[1294.23s -> 1298.07s]  holidays? I'm going to visit you and hug you. That's what we do here
[1298.07s -> 1306.04s]  today. You and me. Is this a ninja turtle? I'm just going to chill
[1306.04s -> 1310.84s]  out here in the fridge. Do you have any cookies? You guys, they're
[1310.84s -> 1323.42s]  planning on eating us. What? Oh no, what am I going to do? Hey,
[1323.42s -> 1328.47s]  welcome to the scream stream. How do I do that? I don't know,
[1328.47s -> 1336.31s]  I'll go back. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Export video. 360. No, share.
[1337.85s -> 1348.41s]  Yeah, there we go. I don't know how. Love it. That was great.
[1349.21s -> 1352.57s]  Unless I can press a button, maybe? All right, we'll get in a
[1352.57s -> 1360.15s]  couple more. Let me go fuck up somebody else's mind show. I
[1360.15s -> 1366.34s]  had to do it, right? I had to do it. You can import source
[1366.34s -> 1370.09s]  filmmaker characters in this game? How loud was that? Did I
[1370.09s -> 1379.45s]  really peak the mic that much? How bad was that peak? There we
[1379.45s -> 1387.58s]  go. Well, there's the new phone. How do we get in to get
[1387.58s -> 1398.71s]  it? How do you think Santa's going to feel about that?
[1407.29s -> 1410.17s]  Sounds good to me. Let's go get that phone. How do I do
[1410.17s -> 1414.41s]  this? I want to remix this. Remix.
[1414.41s -> 1426.90s]  Need to get phone in case. Not big surprise. I can do it.
[1426.90s -> 1452.87s]  Let's go. Wait. Well, there's the new phone. How do we get
[1452.87s -> 1456.95s]  in to get it? No, I just put a bit. How do I be the heavy?
[1459.11s -> 1469.67s]  No, no, no. Record tools. Here. No, no, no, no. Go back.
[1469.67s -> 1473.75s]  Reset, reset. What's going on here? Google Play? I just
[1473.99s -> 1492.34s]  implanted him into the scene. How do I play? Did I do something
[1492.34s -> 1502.34s]  wrong here? Right hand. Okay, that's move. Is there like a...
[1502.98s -> 1512.09s]  Okay, there we go. Hop in, right? Hop in. Is this like
[1512.09s -> 1540.95s]  protected? Hop in. Delete. Okay. Hop in. Trigger. Yeah,
[1540.95s -> 1543.91s]  I'm pressing the trigger. Maybe this, maybe I can't like
[1543.99s -> 1548.25s]  fuck with this one. Let's go back. No, no, don't you?
[1555.27s -> 1568.41s]  Okay, there we go. Remix. So hop in. That was weird. Okay.
[1569.78s -> 1573.43s]  No, no, no, no. All right. Well, shit. Okay, I want to be
[1573.43s -> 1575.67s]  the heavy. I'll just do them both. I'm just going to do
[1575.67s -> 1577.75s]  them both. I'll show you my acting skills. Ready? That
[1577.75s -> 1589.50s]  looks good. You can do like sad. There we go. Hey, hey,
[1589.50s -> 1593.10s]  hey. Do re mi, do re mi, do re mi, do re mi, do re mi. Okay,
[1593.10s -> 1601.19s]  I'm ready. There's the cell phone that you were looking
[1601.19s -> 1601.75s]  for.
[1601.75s -> 1604.15s]  You fucking break in, you fucking idiot. How else do we
[1604.15s -> 1606.95s]  fucking get in there, huh? Actually, if you have a brick
[1606.95s -> 1609.59s]  or something, we could throw the brick through the window
[1609.59s -> 1616.34s]  and steal the phone. That's my hand. You're swearing way
[1616.34s -> 1618.90s]  too much. I did not raise you like this. I did not raise
[1618.90s -> 1620.98s]  you like this. You swear too much. Your mother says the
[1621.06s -> 1626.65s]  same thing. You're going to go to jail one day.
[1626.65s -> 1634.30s]  There's the cell phone that you were looking for.
[1634.30s -> 1637.10s]  You fucking break in, you fucking idiot. How else do we
[1637.10s -> 1640.14s]  fucking get in there, huh? Actually, if you have a brick
[1640.14s -> 1642.78s]  or something, we could throw the brick through the window
[1642.78s -> 1645.82s]  and steal the phone. That's my hand. I think I fucking
[1645.82s -> 1647.98s]  kissed the new fucking phone. You see that shit over there,
[1647.98s -> 1650.62s]  man? That's my fucking new iPhone 25. I did not raise
[1650.62s -> 1652.62s]  you like this. I did not raise you like this. You
[1652.62s -> 1654.78s]  swear too much. Your mother says the same thing.
[1654.78s -> 1659.35s]  Fuck yeah, do as fucking do it. You're going to go to jail
[1659.35s -> 1668.31s]  one day. Let's just remix this fucking one, too.
[1668.31s -> 1677.96s]  We got that one.
[1677.96s -> 1686.65s]  There's the cell phone that you were looking for.
[1686.65s -> 1690.17s]  Yes, cell phone in there. Heavy wants cell phone
[1690.17s -> 1693.13s]  to use. Yeah, actually, if you have a brick or something, we could throw the
[1693.77s -> 1699.37s]  brick through the window. That's good idea. Let me try. I will break
[1699.37s -> 1702.89s]  door down. You're swearing way too much. I did not raise you like this.
[1702.89s -> 1707.13s]  Swear. I did not raise you like this. You swear too much. When did I swear?
[1707.13s -> 1712.25s]  I will crush puny man with fingers and squeeze. I'm kind of doing
[1712.25s -> 1715.13s]  Reinhardt right now at the beginning. All right, whatever.
[1715.13s -> 1720.26s]  There's the cell phone that you were looking for.
[1720.26s -> 1724.02s]  Yes, cell phone in there. Heavy wants cell phone to use.
[1724.10s -> 1727.62s]  Actually, if you have a brick or something, we could throw the brick through the window.
[1729.78s -> 1734.74s]  That's good idea. Let me try. I will break door down. You're swearing way
[1734.74s -> 1736.58s]  too much. I did not raise you like this.
[1736.58s -> 1739.70s]  Swear. I did not raise you like this. You swear too much. When did I swear?
[1740.82s -> 1744.82s]  I will crush puny man with fingers and squeeze. You're going to go to jail one day.
[1746.82s -> 1748.02s]  What the fuck was that?
[1748.74s -> 1757.80s]  No, no, no, I don't want to be a scream stream.
[1760.02s -> 1764.98s]  God damn it. I'm sorry for everybody. Just lower the volume a little.
[1770.63s -> 1782.84s]  There's the cell phone that you were looking for.
[1782.84s -> 1786.60s]  Yes, cell phone in there. Heavy wants cell phone to use.
[1786.60s -> 1790.28s]  Actually, if you have a brick or something, we could throw the brick through the window.
[1790.84s -> 1796.12s]  Squeeze. That's good idea. Let me try. I will break door down.
[1796.12s -> 1799.24s]  You're swearing way too much. I did not raise you like this.
[1799.24s -> 1800.36s]  Swear. I did not raise you like this.
[1800.36s -> 1802.36s]  You swear too much. When did I swear?
[1803.40s -> 1811.26s]  I will crush puny man with fingers and squeeze.
[1811.26s -> 1812.78s]  I told you to be ready for it. I'm sorry.
[1815.53s -> 1818.89s]  There's the cell phone that you were looking for.
[1818.89s -> 1822.65s]  Yes, cell phone in there. Heavy wants cell phone to use.
[1822.65s -> 1826.17s]  Actually, if you have a brick or something, we could throw the brick through the window.
[1828.33s -> 1832.01s]  That's good idea. Let me try. I will break door down.
[1832.01s -> 1835.13s]  You're swearing way too much. I did not raise you like this.
[1835.13s -> 1836.25s]  Swear. I did not raise you like this.
[1836.25s -> 1838.25s]  You swear too much. When did I swear?
[1839.37s -> 1843.21s]  I will crush puny man with fingers and squeeze.
[1846.94s -> 1850.38s]  This is fucking terrible. Can I delete this character forever?
[1851.10s -> 1854.14s]  I'm not going to do that. You're going to blow my vocal cords out
[1854.14s -> 1855.90s]  if I have to put him in every single scene.
[1859.03s -> 1861.99s]  He just has my voice. He doesn't even have a cool voice.
[1871.19s -> 1874.23s]  By the way, I'm just coming to a realization here.
[1874.23s -> 1878.79s]  This is part two of somebody's story that they made.
[1879.75s -> 1882.79s]  I just came in the middle. This person is making a cake.
[1883.75s -> 1888.31s]  The cake has got eggs, it's got baking soda, it's got vanilla extract.
[1888.31s -> 1890.55s]  I just walked in. They went to the bathroom.
[1891.27s -> 1894.31s]  And I came in here and I just dumped in a bunch of gravy
[1894.31s -> 1896.15s]  and just fucking shook it up and left the house.
[1897.67s -> 1900.31s]  That's seriously what I did. Okay.
[1901.91s -> 1903.43s]  I don't think I can add any more people.
[1904.23s -> 1907.03s]  Let's watch it one more time and then we'll move on.
[1907.03s -> 1910.63s]  There's a cell phone that you were looking for.
[1910.63s -> 1916.14s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Remix. Remix. Get me in here.
[1916.78s -> 1918.06s]  Get me in here. We're redoing this one.
[1918.62s -> 1927.11s]  There's a cell phone that you were looking for.
[1927.11s -> 1930.71s]  Yes, cell phone in there. Heavy, what cell phone?
[1930.71s -> 1934.87s]  I didn't break it.
[1934.87s -> 1940.71s]  That's a good idea. Let me try. I will break the door down.
[1940.71s -> 1943.67s]  You're saying too much right now. I didn't raise you like this.
[1943.67s -> 1946.95s]  I did not raise you like this. Your mother says this too.
[1947.93s -> 1950.57s]  I will crush puny man with fingers.
[1951.85s -> 1952.41s]  I'm kind of...
[1956.92s -> 1959.32s]  There is a cell phone that you were looking for.
[1959.32s -> 1962.76s]  Yes, cell phone in there. Heavy, what cell phone?
[1962.76s -> 1971.08s]  I didn't break it.
[1971.08s -> 1975.72s]  I didn't raise you like this.
[1975.72s -> 1978.28s]  I didn't raise you like this.
[1978.28s -> 1979.24s]  Your mother says this too.
[1980.04s -> 1982.68s]  I will crush puny man with fingers.
[1983.56s -> 1994.17s]  I'm fucking out of here. I'm out of here. I'm out of this. I'm done. That was bad.
[1996.17s -> 2005.70s]  What happened to mine? Oh, I went back.
[2012.98s -> 2022.98s]  Why is it always a little kid? It's always a kid. Why is the biggest guy always the little kid?
[2025.98s -> 2027.98s]  You break the window.
[2027.98s -> 2029.98s]  Alright, I'm getting the fuck out of here.
[2034.93s -> 2042.51s]  What else is there? I love this. Let's do, uh, Big Barb's Bee Farm.
[2042.51s -> 2065.92s]  Hamsgiving. Space Trek. Space Trek. Part 3. Let's get in this one. Watch this.
[2065.92s -> 2071.92s]  Make them all screaming lettuce. Guys, you want this stream to be like 45 minutes long?
[2071.92s -> 2079.92s]  Is that what you want? Because the more that I scream as loud as I can, the more it's going to be over in like less than two hours.
[2080.92s -> 2089.24s]  Alright, here we go. I gotta go in for this one. Who should I be? Let's find out.
[2091.99s -> 2101.49s]  I could have gone a little bit better. The alien was pretty hostile, I gotta admit. But, you know, at least we're here in this great desert.
[2101.49s -> 2105.49s]  There are literally no life signs on the entire planet in case you were wondering.
[2105.49s -> 2106.49s]  Oh, that's good.
[2106.49s -> 2110.49s]  Well, I wasn't wondering, but thanks for letting me know. Good to know.
[2110.49s -> 2113.49s]  Well, at least there's no one left to write us a bad report, right?
[2113.49s -> 2116.49s]  Well, I hope we can find our way back to the ship.
[2118.49s -> 2119.49s]  Watch this one.
[2123.65s -> 2149.72s]  Come on. I can't be like the tourist. I can't move you? Oh, it's protected. Come on.
[2149.72s -> 2158.22s]  How is this like protected? I was gonna put them all the way back there and be sprinting down screaming about how there's no oxygen on the planet.
[2158.22s -> 2176.63s]  Oh, come on. Yeah, I'm hoping it. Can I? How do I teleport? Can I teleport?
[2177.63s -> 2202.19s]  Here we go. Teleport. No, no, no, no. That looks good.
[2205.78s -> 2212.54s]  Am I gonna bump into anything? Where am I? I don't know. I'm gonna smash into something. I'm not careful.
[2212.54s -> 2239.57s]  Thank God. This light. Hey, it's quicksand. Shit. Hey, why do you not have astronaut helmets on?
[2239.57s -> 2247.56s]  There's no oxygen on the planet. No. No. No, I told you.
[2248.56s -> 2249.56s]  Okay, I'm back. Quicksand.
[2249.56s -> 2252.56s]  There's no one left to write us a bad report, right?
[2252.56s -> 2255.56s]  Try it. I'll come over there and I'll give you the oxygen pills.
[2256.56s -> 2269.50s]  Why is this one different? Where's the camera? Wait, what? No, give me over here.
[2277.81s -> 2280.81s]  So, how did it go?
[2282.62s -> 2284.62s]  It's quicksand. Shit.
[2284.62s -> 2285.62s]  It didn't go very good.
[2286.62s -> 2287.62s]  It didn't like me.
[2287.62s -> 2295.00s]  Why do you not have astronaut helmets on? There's no oxygen on the planet. No, I told you.
[2299.10s -> 2302.10s]  Well, at least there's no one left to write us a bad report, right?
[2303.10s -> 2306.10s]  Try it. I'll come over there and I'll give you the oxygen pills.
[2307.10s -> 2326.41s]  What a fucking mess. How do I move the character? Put to boomer in.
[2326.41s -> 2336.38s]  Hold on. I'm going to delete this character. Hold on.
[2341.26s -> 2342.26s]  All right, now we got our own scene.
[2342.26s -> 2363.43s]  Go right here. What are we going to do about that? Characters.
[2364.43s -> 2365.67s]  What about voices and shit?
[2372.10s -> 2374.10s]  Is there a way we can change that?
[2374.10s -> 2377.59s]  Let's hold on. Looks good. No, no, no. This is like more... There we go.
[2378.59s -> 2379.59s]  That's better. Okay.
[2387.08s -> 2388.08s]  Three o'clock.
[2389.08s -> 2394.01s]  Do you know this guy?
[2396.38s -> 2397.38s]  You all right?
[2397.38s -> 2399.38s]  Why do you not have astronaut helmets on?
[2400.38s -> 2401.38s]  Because we can breathe.
[2401.38s -> 2402.38s]  There's no oxygen on the planet.
[2405.38s -> 2406.38s]  You're stupid.
[2406.38s -> 2407.38s]  No, I told you.
[2408.38s -> 2409.38s]  Do you know this guy?
[2409.38s -> 2410.87s]  Quicksand.
[2411.87s -> 2412.87s]  We can move around fine, man.
[2413.87s -> 2415.87s]  I'll come over there and I'll give you the oxygen pills.
[2420.38s -> 2421.38s]  You're stupid.
[2428.10s -> 2429.10s]  How do I change the voice?
[2430.10s -> 2432.42s]  Jesus.
[2434.18s -> 2435.18s]  Is there a way to change the voice?
[2444.46s -> 2445.46s]  Auto changes. Okay.
[2446.46s -> 2447.46s]  Oh, hey, Keywell.
[2447.46s -> 2448.46s]  Here we go. Ready?
[2448.46s -> 2452.72s]  I got to get this right because we have to both like suck in the air at the same time.
[2456.26s -> 2457.26s]  What do you got for a time?
[2457.26s -> 2458.26s]  Three o'clock.
[2458.26s -> 2459.26s]  Thank God it's light.
[2459.26s -> 2462.90s]  Hey, it's Quicksand.
[2462.90s -> 2463.90s]  Do you know this guy?
[2463.90s -> 2464.90s]  Shit.
[2464.90s -> 2465.90s]  I don't know who that is.
[2465.90s -> 2466.90s]  Hey, you all right?
[2466.90s -> 2468.90s]  Why do you not have astronaut helmets on?
[2469.90s -> 2470.90s]  Because we can breathe.
[2470.90s -> 2471.90s]  There's no oxygen on the planet.
[2474.90s -> 2475.90s]  You're stupid.
[2475.90s -> 2476.90s]  No, I told you.
[2476.90s -> 2477.90s]  You are an idiot.
[2477.90s -> 2478.90s]  Do you know this guy?
[2478.90s -> 2479.90s]  I don't know that.
[2479.90s -> 2480.90s]  Why do you keep asking me that?
[2481.90s -> 2482.90s]  I got a rope.
[2482.90s -> 2483.90s]  Hold on.
[2484.90s -> 2485.90s]  Little finger.
[2485.90s -> 2486.90s]  That's a rope.
[2492.68s -> 2493.68s]  Oh, shit.
[2500.74s -> 2501.74s]  I got too into it.
[2501.74s -> 2502.74s]  I got too into the fucking scene.
[2503.74s -> 2505.11s]  Hold on.
[2505.11s -> 2512.18s]  Go back.
[2512.18s -> 2514.18s]  I wanted to see it so bad from this angle.
[2520.54s -> 2521.54s]  I got to learn how to do like cameras.
[2521.54s -> 2522.54s]  Like I think it's like this, right?
[2523.54s -> 2527.02s]  So we can start here.
[2532.26s -> 2533.26s]  Thank God it's light.
[2539.30s -> 2540.74s]  Hey, it's Quicksand.
[2540.74s -> 2541.74s]  Do you know this guy?
[2541.74s -> 2542.74s]  Shit.
[2542.74s -> 2545.58s]  I don't know who that is.
[2545.58s -> 2546.58s]  I can move in like here.
[2548.20s -> 2550.20s]  Hey, you all right?
[2550.20s -> 2552.50s]  Why do you not have astronaut helmets on?
[2553.50s -> 2554.50s]  Because we can breathe.
[2554.50s -> 2555.50s]  There's no oxygen on the planet.
[2558.50s -> 2559.50s]  I hate that.
[2559.50s -> 2560.50s]  I hate it so much.
[2560.50s -> 2561.50s]  You're stupid.
[2561.50s -> 2562.50s]  No, I told you.
[2562.50s -> 2563.50s]  You are an idiot.
[2563.50s -> 2564.50s]  Do you know this guy?
[2564.50s -> 2565.50s]  Quicksand.
[2565.50s -> 2566.50s]  I don't know that.
[2566.50s -> 2567.50s]  Why do you keep asking me that?
[2567.50s -> 2568.50s]  I got a rope.
[2568.50s -> 2569.50s]  I got a rope.
[2569.50s -> 2572.09s]  I got a rope.
[2572.09s -> 2573.09s]  I'll give you the oxygen by the finger.
[2574.09s -> 2576.93s]  Hold on.
[2582.65s -> 2583.65s]  Okay.
[2583.65s -> 2585.65s]  My hands are like too shaky to do this.
[2585.65s -> 2586.65s]  God damn it.
[2586.65s -> 2587.65s]  Hold on.
[2587.65s -> 2589.65s]  My hands are like fucking shaky as hell.
[2593.62s -> 2594.62s]  Thank God it's light.
[2595.62s -> 2596.98s]  All right.
[2596.98s -> 2597.98s]  Hold on a second.
[2597.98s -> 2598.98s]  Let me put this down.
[2598.98s -> 2600.35s]  Where is it?
[2600.35s -> 2601.35s]  I'm down on the ground.
[2601.35s -> 2602.78s]  All right.
[2602.78s -> 2605.78s]  Let's sit here and watch it while I have like shaky sniper hands.
[2607.78s -> 2608.78s]  Thank God it's light.
[2609.78s -> 2613.33s]  It's Quicksand.
[2613.33s -> 2614.57s]  Do you know this guy?
[2614.57s -> 2618.05s]  I don't ever get it.
[2618.05s -> 2619.42s]  Why do you not have astralisks on?
[2620.42s -> 2621.42s]  Because we can breathe.
[2621.42s -> 2622.42s]  There's no oxygen on the planet.
[2625.59s -> 2627.22s]  No.
[2627.22s -> 2628.22s]  I told you.
[2628.22s -> 2629.22s]  You are an idiot.
[2629.22s -> 2630.22s]  Do you know this guy?
[2630.22s -> 2631.22s]  Quicksand.
[2631.22s -> 2632.22s]  I don't know that.
[2632.22s -> 2633.22s]  Why do you keep asking me that?
[2633.22s -> 2634.22s]  I got a rope.
[2634.22s -> 2635.22s]  We can move out of the highland.
[2635.22s -> 2647.76s]  I'll get over there and I'll give you the oxygen by the finger.
[2647.76s -> 2648.76s]  What do I have?
[2648.76s -> 2649.76s]  Save performance.
[2649.76s -> 2650.76s]  Okay.
[2650.76s -> 2652.58s]  How do I do that?
[2652.58s -> 2653.58s]  Now get this off.

[3310.30s -> 3312.30s]  Yeah, I'm just realizing that.
[3312.30s -> 3314.30s]  Why is the camera man in focus?
[3314.30s -> 3316.30s]  It should be from that perspective.
[3321.44s -> 3323.44s]  It's time to make our room, okay?
[3323.44s -> 3328.14s]  Let's share this one.

[3355.65s -> 3358.34s]  Let's see how this works.
[3358.34s -> 3360.34s]  Okay, untitled by Tommy Pickles.
[3360.34s -> 3362.34s]  We got hip.
[3362.34s -> 3364.34s]  Space, a diner?
[3364.34s -> 3365.34s]  Okay.
[3365.34s -> 3375.63s]  Is there a gym?
[3377.63s -> 3381.52s]  Here we go.
[3381.52s -> 3385.23s]  Alright, opening scene.
[3385.23s -> 3386.23s]  Environment.
[3386.23s -> 3387.66s]  Characters.
[3387.66s -> 3393.48s]  Okay, let's go with...
[3393.48s -> 3404.24s]  Let's start with you.
[3404.24s -> 3405.24s]  Where's my other options?
[3405.24s -> 3406.24s]  Why are they locked?
[3406.24s -> 3414.22s]  I can't move them?
[3414.22s -> 3416.22s]  Do I not have access to this?
[3416.22s -> 3417.91s]  For some reason?
[3417.91s -> 3418.91s]  Why is it locked?
[3418.91s -> 3431.39s]  It's DLC!
[3431.39s -> 3436.38s]  It might be in record mode.
[3436.38s -> 3446.67s]  How do I get that off?
[3446.67s -> 3448.67s]  No, it's not DLC.
[3448.67s -> 3454.60s]  Weirdly enough, it thinks I'm still trying to videotape.
[3454.60s -> 3459.33s]  I wonder if I can just put somebody else in here.
[3459.33s -> 3461.33s]  I'm still doing the same thing.
[3461.33s -> 3465.56s]  Nothing like over here.
[3465.56s -> 3469.46s]  It's just glitched out in record...
[3469.46s -> 3471.46s]  Alright, let me go back to the main menu.
[3471.46s -> 3473.83s]  Let's try it again.
[3473.83s -> 3475.83s]  Create show.
[3475.83s -> 3483.12s]  Pretty good.
[3484.12s -> 3485.56s]  Huh.
[3485.56s -> 3487.56s]  Maybe I should need to restart the game?
[3487.56s -> 3493.21s]  Green screen?
[3493.21s -> 3494.21s]  Green screen?
[3494.21s -> 3495.21s]  Hold on, hold on.
[3495.21s -> 3503.45s]  Behind me.
[3503.45s -> 3506.40s]  Click one of these sides?
[3506.40s -> 3510.90s]  Oh, hold on.
[3510.90s -> 3516.20s]  Props.
[3516.20s -> 3521.94s]  Environment.
[3523.82s -> 3528.72s]  So you want to be a secret agent?
[3528.72s -> 3535.70s]  Just record it and then edit it.
[3535.70s -> 3540.05s]  I guess I'm just recording.
[3540.05s -> 3541.05s]  Okay.
[3541.05s -> 3543.80s]  No, it's not recording anything.
[3543.80s -> 3552.44s]  I think I might have to restart the game.
[3552.44s -> 3555.64s]  I can't even press this.
[3558.61s -> 3563.73s]  Yellow dots?
[3563.73s -> 3569.58s]  Clear?
[3569.58s -> 3573.55s]  Nah, something's not right here.
[3573.55s -> 3576.84s]  Something's not right.
[3576.84s -> 3577.84s]  I'm stuck in the void.
[3577.84s -> 3582.64s]  I'm just going to restart the game.
[3582.64s -> 3583.64s]  Yeah, let's just restart it.
[3583.64s -> 3584.64s]  Give me a second.
[3584.64s -> 3589.12s]  I'm also, you know what?
[3589.12s -> 3591.74s]  Let's get some wine up here too.
[3591.74s -> 3596.88s]  I'm going to make a whole goddamn movie.
[3596.88s -> 3600.21s]  Let's get some wine up here.
[3601.21s -> 3605.56s]  Let me get out for a second.
[3605.56s -> 3609.52s]  I'm going to restart the game.
[3609.52s -> 3610.52s]  This is a ton of fun.
[3610.52s -> 3618.64s]  I will be right back.
[3618.64s -> 3821.40s]  I'm going to get this restarted and grab a glass of wine.
[3821.40s -> 3826.40s]  It is like 4,000 degrees in this room already.
[3826.40s -> 3828.40s]  All right, let me get back in here.
[3828.40s -> 3830.40s]  Let's hope that fixes it because this is...
[3830.40s -> 3833.79s]  I'm not going to say it yet.
[3833.79s -> 3835.67s]  I'm not sure.
[3835.67s -> 3837.67s]  But this could be...
[3837.67s -> 3841.04s]  This could be like one of the coolest VR games.
[3841.04s -> 3843.17s]  Very possible.
[3843.17s -> 3849.60s]  Reopen it up.
[3849.60s -> 3854.14s]  Mind show.
[3854.14s -> 3865.15s]  Okay, let's try it again.
[3865.15s -> 3866.15s]  Hey, everybody!
[3866.15s -> 3870.56s]  Hey, did you see?
[3870.56s -> 3882.75s]  Okay.
[3882.75s -> 3883.75s]  Okay.
[3883.75s -> 3884.75s]  Welcome to mind show.
[3884.75s -> 3886.69s]  I'm drunk.
[3886.69s -> 3891.39s]  This is not...
[3891.39s -> 3892.39s]  This is like...
[3892.39s -> 3893.39s]  That's a heavy pour, all right?
[3893.39s -> 3894.95s]  It is.
[3894.95s -> 3896.95s]  But I said I'm going to be drinking it for like four hours.
[3896.95s -> 3898.96s]  All right, let's go.
[3898.96s -> 3902.18s]  Get me back in.
[3902.18s -> 3906.36s]  Show it again.
[3906.36s -> 3910.10s]  This also might be skunked.
[3910.10s -> 3914.22s]  Because this is the...
[3914.22s -> 3915.22s]  Hey, hold on.
[3915.22s -> 3919.36s]  For all of you like scientists, if this...
[3919.36s -> 3928.10s]  If you leave a bottle of wine out for like six hours after opening it and you put it back in the fridge, are you going to die?
[3928.10s -> 3934.27s]  Does that kill you?
[3934.27s -> 3935.27s]  Am I going to get tapeworm?
[3935.27s -> 3936.44s]  I don't want to get tapeworm.
[3936.44s -> 3939.16s]  Am I going to get like...
[3939.16s -> 3940.16s]  Am I going to get worms?
[3940.16s -> 3947.03s]  All right.
[3947.03s -> 3949.04s]  Yuck.
[3949.04s -> 3950.47s]  Ew.
[3950.47s -> 3952.16s]  All right.
[3952.16s -> 3953.16s]  I'm ready to do my comedy routine.
[3953.16s -> 3956.12s]  There we go.
[3956.12s -> 3959.84s]  It's already dirty in here.
[3959.84s -> 3960.84s]  Sweat check.
[3960.84s -> 3961.84s]  We're good.
[3961.84s -> 3966.38s]  I know you're not supposed to do this, but fuck it.
[3966.38s -> 3967.68s]  I have to.
[3967.68s -> 3968.68s]  It's too greasy in here.
[3968.68s -> 3978.69s]  All right.
[3978.69s -> 3979.69s]  Wait.
[3979.69s -> 3992.13s]  One more sip of wine.
[3992.13s -> 3993.13s]  I thought it taste right.
[3993.13s -> 3995.84s]  I thought it taste right.
[3995.84s -> 4002.93s]  Tastes like batteries.
[4002.93s -> 4004.93s]  That tastes like batteries smell.
[4004.93s -> 4014.36s]  Wrong hand.
[4014.36s -> 4016.95s]  Okay.
[4016.95s -> 4022.46s]  Where's like...
[4022.46s -> 4023.46s]  Assistant!
[4023.46s -> 4032.42s]  To help me get in here, you need a personal assistant to get in and out of VR.
[4032.42s -> 4035.42s]  That's why when they do the demos, it's like three people there holding stuff for you.
[4035.42s -> 4037.30s]  All right.
[4037.30s -> 4039.95s]  I'm ready.
[4039.95s -> 4043.30s]  Fuck.
[4043.30s -> 4044.30s]  Wrong hand.
[4044.30s -> 4045.30s]  How did I do this?
[4045.30s -> 4046.30s]  What?
[4046.30s -> 4047.30s]  I just checked it.
[4047.30s -> 4048.30s]  Assistant!
[4048.30s -> 4049.86s]  Assistant!
[4049.86s -> 4051.29s]  Assistant!
[4051.29s -> 4052.29s]  That's flat.
[4052.29s -> 4065.76s]  I'm better than that.
[4065.76s -> 4066.76s]  Email notifications.
[4066.76s -> 4067.76s]  Get notified.
[4067.76s -> 4068.76s]  Don't email me.
[4068.76s -> 4070.70s]  Followers?
[4070.70s -> 4071.70s]  Who am I?
[4071.70s -> 4072.94s]  I'm already following people.
[4072.94s -> 4073.94s]  Here we go.
[4073.94s -> 4075.63s]  Can we...
[4075.63s -> 4078.85s]  Why is this different?
[4078.85s -> 4079.85s]  Hey!
[4079.85s -> 4080.85s]  Look at that.
[4080.85s -> 4082.16s]  Why?
[4082.16s -> 4083.16s]  Why did this switch?
[4083.16s -> 4084.16s]  Whatever.
[4084.16s -> 4085.65s]  Comedy club.
[4085.65s -> 4086.83s]  Can you guys hear?
[4086.83s -> 4088.90s]  Is it muted?
[4088.90s -> 4090.40s]  Shouldn't be muted, right?
[4090.40s -> 4091.40s]  Okay.
[4091.40s -> 4092.40s]  All right.
[4092.40s -> 4095.24s]  Let's do it.
[4095.24s -> 4096.24s]  So, this scene is going to be...
[4096.24s -> 4102.85s]  Let's block it out here, everybody.
[4102.85s -> 4104.03s]  Acting 101.
[4104.03s -> 4105.72s]  103, actually.
[4105.72s -> 4106.72s]  The first thing you need to do is...
[4107.72s -> 4108.72s]  I don't like it here.
[4108.72s -> 4109.72s]  That's better.
[4109.72s -> 4110.72s]  First thing you need to do in acting is get into a character, right?
[4110.72s -> 4112.08s]  So, we're going to pick a character and we're going to...
[4112.08s -> 4113.08s]  I'm going to give you the whole backstory.
[4113.08s -> 4114.39s]  New.
[4114.39s -> 4115.39s]  Okay, move a little closer.
[4115.39s -> 4116.39s]  Wait.
[4116.39s -> 4121.92s]  We're going to have a few people in the scene here to laugh at the jokes.
[4121.92s -> 4122.92s]  Snow person?
[4122.92s -> 4124.60s]  I can only have three people.
[4124.60s -> 4125.60s]  Shit.
[4125.60s -> 4126.84s]  Oh, I'm sorry.

[4153.67s -> 4155.42s]  I'm sorry.
[4155.42s -> 4160.82s]  I'm sorry.
[4160.82s -> 4162.96s]  I'm sorry.
[4162.96s -> 4163.96s]  I'm sorry.
[4163.96s -> 4164.96s]  Shit.
[4164.96s -> 4165.96s]  Okay, well that's fine.
[4165.96s -> 4172.84s]  How do I drop the mic stand?
[4172.84s -> 4173.84s]  The mic is too high.
[4173.84s -> 4176.21s]  All right, let's get this blocked out.
[4176.21s -> 4177.21s]  Ready?
[4177.21s -> 4183.28s]  So, I'm going to get in here and we'll go with happy.
[4183.28s -> 4188.76s]  Dude, are my hands actually this shaky?
[4188.76s -> 4192.24s]  What happened?
[4192.24s -> 4194.57s]  What?
[4194.57s -> 4196.94s]  Didn't I switch this?
[4196.94s -> 4198.94s]  I'm confused.
[4198.94s -> 4199.94s]  Okay.
[4199.94s -> 4200.94s]  I don't know.
[4200.94s -> 4206.12s]  I switched it like three times.
[4206.12s -> 4208.12s]  Okay, I just poisoned somebody's drink.
[4208.12s -> 4213.12s]  Sitting across from them and we switched the poisons back and forth enough times where
[4213.12s -> 4215.12s]  I poisoned myself.
[4215.12s -> 4216.56s]  Whatever.
[4216.56s -> 4224.53s]  We just did the princess bride.
[4224.53s -> 4227.18s]  All right.
[4227.18s -> 4228.42s]  Here we go.
[4228.42s -> 4231.79s]  Can I grab the mic?
[4231.79s -> 4232.79s]  Here we go.
[4232.79s -> 4235.92s]  We're going to get some jokes here.
[4235.92s -> 4236.92s]  Okay.

[6181.20s -> 6185.01s]  I'm going to go
[6185.01s -> 6188.01s]  I got to think about how I wanted this to be shot

[6221.52s -> 6224.52s]  back it up
[6224.52s -> 6233.26s]  we're locked out of the room
[6233.26s -> 6236.26s]  we can't get in
[6236.26s -> 6239.26s]  it's a surgery scheduled
[6239.26s -> 6242.26s]  I know there's a surgery scheduled
[6242.26s -> 6246.72s]  there's like 3 different scenes
[6246.72s -> 6249.72s]  going on
[6249.72s -> 6252.72s]  back it up
[6252.72s -> 6263.44s]  there's so many things going on here
[6263.44s -> 6269.69s]  we're locked out of the room
[6269.69s -> 6272.69s]  we can't get in
[6272.69s -> 6276.00s]  it's a surgery scheduled
[6276.00s -> 6285.32s]  back it up
[6285.32s -> 6289.96s]  we're locked out of the room

[6292.96s -> 6312.89s]  get me outside here
[6312.89s -> 6315.89s]  it's a surgery scheduled
[6315.89s -> 6321.63s]  let's go with this
[6321.63s -> 6330.31s]  let's look at the scene
[6330.31s -> 6333.31s]  I scheduled it
[6333.31s -> 6348.32s]  this is unbelievable
[6348.32s -> 6351.32s]  hey
[6351.32s -> 6354.32s]  hey
[6354.32s -> 6357.32s]  you're dirtying
[6357.32s -> 6361.84s]  you can do it
[6361.84s -> 6364.84s]  you can do it
[6364.84s -> 6368.34s]  you got like 3.6 on yellow
[6368.34s -> 6372.60s]  I don't even know where to put the camera
[6372.60s -> 6378.77s]  you can do it man
[6378.77s -> 6381.77s]  at least get your cell phone out and film this
[6381.77s -> 6384.77s]  you can do it
[6384.77s -> 6394.09s]  you can do it
[6394.09s -> 6397.09s]  you can do it
[6397.09s -> 6400.09s]  you can do it
[6400.09s -> 6403.09s]  this is fucked
[6403.09s -> 6406.09s]  I can't even handle how fucking dumb this one is
[6406.09s -> 6416.50s]  this is fucked
[6416.50s -> 6421.02s]  this is fucked
[6421.02s -> 6426.63s]  are you guys ready to watch this shit
[6426.63s -> 6435.44s]  I need to save this one
[6435.44s -> 6448.00s]  how do I do that
[6448.00s -> 6457.20s]  did I do it
[6457.20s -> 6461.20s]  yellow dots is saved
[6461.20s -> 6465.02s]  it said save performance
[6465.02s -> 6468.39s]  let me see if this works
[6468.39s -> 6472.52s]  where's the camera
[6472.52s -> 6488.80s]  did I just lose everything
[6488.80s -> 6491.80s]  why would it do that
[6491.80s -> 6494.80s]  did that actually work
[6494.80s -> 6504.51s]  I did all that work and then I said save performance
[6504.51s -> 6508.58s]  and it just exited the screen
[6508.58s -> 6511.58s]  is this going to save the camera shit
[6511.58s -> 6516.87s]  I hope so
[6516.87s -> 6527.64s]  it will not
[6527.64s -> 6538.61s]  hold on let me see
[6538.61s -> 6541.61s]  I'm so confused at how that works
[6541.61s -> 6544.61s]  I did everything and on the top left it said save performance
[6545.61s -> 6567.33s]  can I watch that now
[6567.33s -> 6570.76s]  because I can't
[6570.76s -> 6573.76s]  where's my
[6573.76s -> 6576.76s]  hold trigger to record that's like what I did
[6576.76s -> 6582.37s]  that's kind of an odd menu system
[6582.37s -> 6594.30s]  because now
[6594.30s -> 6597.30s]  I've misclicked when trying to save
[6597.30s -> 6608.52s]  the recording thing is still red
[6608.52s -> 6611.52s]  how do I watch it from here
[6611.52s -> 6614.52s]  there's no real clear indication of
[6614.52s -> 6617.52s]  when I record like this
[6617.52s -> 6625.61s]  where does it go
[6625.61s -> 6631.48s]  I'm just going to go to the menu to see what happens
[6631.48s -> 6647.55s]  I'm just going to go back
[6647.55s -> 6655.70s]  sharing to stream
[6655.70s -> 6658.70s]  saving the performance overwrites the camera data
[6658.70s -> 6673.27s]  why the hell would that happen
[6673.27s -> 6676.27s]  it's working right
[6676.27s -> 6679.27s]  oh
[6679.27s -> 6682.27s]  ok
[6682.27s -> 6685.27s]  I scheduled
[6685.27s -> 6688.27s]  I don't know what you are telling me
[6688.27s -> 6691.27s]  did that work
[6691.27s -> 6694.27s]  I'm so confused
[6694.27s -> 6697.27s]  hey you dirty
[6697.27s -> 6700.27s]  dirty
[6700.27s -> 6703.27s]  you can do it
[6703.27s -> 6703.91s]  You can do it!
[6703.91s -> 6705.41s]  I mean, I can't believe you can do it.
[6706.41s -> 6708.54s]  You got like, 3.6 on you.
[6708.54s -> 6709.54s]  I think it's just doin' it.
[6709.54s -> 6710.30s]  Come on, suffer.
[6711.30s -> 6712.50s]  What the fuck is happening?
[6712.50s -> 6715.00s]  You can at least get your cell phone out and film this.
[6715.00s -> 6716.20s]  This is getting a lot of video.
[6716.20s -> 6717.20s]  No, it's working.
[6717.20s -> 6718.30s]  Some of these people aren't even alive.
[6718.30s -> 6718.90s]  That's a skeleton.
[6718.90s -> 6720.50s]  Hey, I just proved I'm a playlist, man.
[6721.50s -> 6722.80s]  Am I gonna make you in the scene?
[6722.80s -> 6724.70s]  Yeah, it's a custom playlist.
[6724.70s -> 6726.20s]  It gets people hooked up in the Zoom.
[6726.20s -> 6728.20s]  I gotta stab her in the head so that I don't hurt her.
[6728.20s -> 6728.90s]  Yeah, okay.
[6728.90s -> 6730.30s]  Well, let's try it a little bit.
[6730.30s -> 6731.10s]  I'm just gonna wait.
[6732.46s -> 6733.26s]  Did I do it?
[6734.16s -> 6735.86s]  What the hell is going on here?
[6740.30s -> 6741.60s]  What the fuck?
[6753.77s -> 6755.67s]  Does anybody have any idea what the fuck is happening?
[6758.92s -> 6761.92s]  It just went, it's going crazy and now it's like doing the thing.
[6767.04s -> 6768.74s]  It was rendering, was it though?
[6769.34s -> 6770.34s]  I feel like that's the beginning.
[6780.00s -> 6781.60s]  Did I have too conflicting takes?
[6781.60s -> 6782.60s]  Nah, I don't think so.
[6798.46s -> 6801.36s]  I mean, it's exporting, but it's exporting like, incorrectly.
[6806.82s -> 6811.42s]  So if I like even, if I even touch right trigger at all,
[6811.82s -> 6812.82s]  it deletes the whole thing.
[6813.72s -> 6816.02s]  You'd think there'd be like a confirmation there or something.
[6816.12s -> 6818.62s]  Like, oh, you sure you want to like delete all the camera shit you just did?
[6820.96s -> 6822.16s]  I don't, I don't think I did that though.
[6830.04s -> 6832.14s]  That's the multiple takes at the beginning.
[6832.24s -> 6833.44s]  Oh, okay.
[6834.84s -> 6835.74s]  How do I get out of here?
[6844.02s -> 6845.12s]  How do I get out of here?
[6847.67s -> 6848.07s]  What?
[6859.46s -> 6860.66s]  Did I beat the game?
[6863.56s -> 6864.56s]  This is all fucked up.
[6870.26s -> 6871.16s]  Okay, come back.
[6872.64s -> 6874.24s]  View, viewer position.
[6874.24s -> 6875.54s]  What the fuck is happening?
[6879.02s -> 6880.12s]  So I have to do that again.
[6887.85s -> 6888.75s]  So this is the very beginning.
[6889.15s -> 6889.75s]  God damn it.
[6889.75s -> 6890.15s]  All right.
[6891.60s -> 6892.10s]  Fuck.
[6892.50s -> 6893.30s]  That was done.
[6900.80s -> 6901.20s]  All right.
[6901.20s -> 6902.80s]  So let's do it again.
[6904.00s -> 6904.80s]  What a pain in the ass.
[6923.00s -> 6923.70s]  I'll make it quick.
[6944.48s -> 6945.48s]  No, back up here, back up here.
[6956.06s -> 6961.64s]  All right, slowly but surely.
[7009.89s -> 7011.09s]  Some of these people aren't even alive.
[7049.69s -> 7050.09s]  All right.
[7050.09s -> 7050.59s]  Okay.
[7050.79s -> 7051.29s]  All right.
[7051.77s -> 7052.67s]  Nobody move.
[7054.40s -> 7055.10s]  Nobody move.
[7064.87s -> 7065.57s]  I got it.
[7066.46s -> 7068.16s]  So now it's ready.
[7070.13s -> 7071.33s]  I didn't need to do this.
[7073.00s -> 7074.20s]  It's already saved.
[7075.26s -> 7076.16s]  Well, but what about the camera?
[7076.16s -> 7077.36s]  Like freaking out all over the place?
[7077.36s -> 7078.96s]  Because I did like the multiple tapes, right?
[7081.86s -> 7083.46s]  I didn't need to redo it.
[7084.26s -> 7085.26s]  Oh, it already did it.
[7085.26s -> 7086.46s]  Oh, what the fuck?
[7087.34s -> 7087.54s]  All right.
[7087.54s -> 7088.84s]  Let's watch the damn thing.
[7092.02s -> 7092.62s]  You ready?
[7104.12s -> 7104.92s]  No.
[7106.22s -> 7107.42s]  No, play it.
[7129.24s -> 7131.44s]  I just practiced it needs to render.
[7131.94s -> 7132.84s]  All right, but like
[7133.94s -> 7136.34s]  so what not save performance from here.
[7141.92s -> 7142.92s]  Look at my computer.
[7146.48s -> 7147.08s]  What about it?
[7147.89s -> 7148.59s]  What are you talking about?
[7155.12s -> 7156.52s]  Labs is the culprit.
[7157.90s -> 7160.50s]  So you tell me if I click on save performance
[7160.90s -> 7163.40s]  or if I click on more and I do save.
[7168.28s -> 7168.88s]  Yeah, I okay.
[7168.88s -> 7170.88s]  I know it saves it in documents folder, but
[7173.38s -> 7180.35s]  so if I go to export right now the files are on yeah,
[7180.35s -> 7182.85s]  but like how do I know it's even saving what I just did?
[7186.79s -> 7187.19s]  All right.
[7187.19s -> 7187.59s]  Hold on.
[7193.48s -> 7195.28s]  Documents mind show videos.
[7195.28s -> 7195.78s]  Okay.
[7196.18s -> 7199.11s]  What the fuck?
[7208.87s -> 7212.78s]  I see it, but it's all fucked up.
[7213.88s -> 7214.18s]  All right.
[7214.18s -> 7216.88s]  So it's the cameras all fucked up.
[7216.88s -> 7218.38s]  It's all shaking around like crazy.
[7220.25s -> 7221.75s]  I don't know why it's doing this.
[7223.14s -> 7224.34s]  Holy shit.
[7224.34s -> 7225.54s]  It's so fucked up.
[7230.28s -> 7231.48s]  What the fuck?
[7235.20s -> 7235.50s]  All right.
[7235.50s -> 7238.40s]  I'm going to export this one and see what happens.
[7242.25s -> 7243.65s]  Yeah, this video is all fucked up.
[7246.30s -> 7246.80s]  It's the same.
[7250.44s -> 7251.64s]  I'll show you the curse after.
[7252.38s -> 7253.48s]  I'm going to try to save this one.
[7253.48s -> 7253.98s]  So all right.
[7253.98s -> 7254.68s]  Let me get this straight.
[7254.68s -> 7258.18s]  Save performance export video, right?
[7265.82s -> 7269.61s]  My god, this shouldn't be this complicated.
[7272.75s -> 7274.05s]  Save performance.
[7276.58s -> 7276.98s]  What?
[7276.98s -> 7277.28s]  All right.
[7277.28s -> 7279.87s]  The export.
[7280.47s -> 7281.07s]  Where is it?
[7284.56s -> 7288.00s]  What you see what I'm talking about?
[7289.86s -> 7290.86s]  What happened to it?
[7297.49s -> 7306.49s]  Share 60 FPS.
[7308.99s -> 7309.89s]  It's gonna work.
[7311.99s -> 7313.19s]  I can't hear this anymore.
[7313.39s -> 7314.19s]  You just dropped away.
[7315.19s -> 7317.39s]  There's a surgery scheduled in 20 minutes.
[7317.39s -> 7319.09s]  I know there's a surgery scheduled.
[7319.49s -> 7320.49s]  I scheduled it.
[7327.27s -> 7328.27s]  I think this is working.
[7342.60s -> 7343.00s]  All right.
[7343.60s -> 7346.80s]  If you've got a save performance button in the top left.
[7347.40s -> 7349.50s]  You got to go right to another menu after that.
[7350.30s -> 7351.60s]  You can just fuck it all up.
[7355.00s -> 7357.30s]  I thought like save performance, save it and save it.
[7359.40s -> 7360.60s]  But it's not like the video.
[7360.60s -> 7361.80s]  They're two separate entities.
[7368.44s -> 7368.84s]  Okay.
[7368.94s -> 7369.44s]  All right.
[7370.77s -> 7372.67s]  It's time to watch that video.
[7372.67s -> 7373.57s]  Oh, thank God.
[7373.57s -> 7374.47s]  It's finally done.
[7389.10s -> 7390.40s]  Time for the next scene.
[7395.15s -> 7397.45s]  Well, there wasn't no tutorial on that one.
[7398.48s -> 7399.48s]  I had to just guess.
[7410.96s -> 7412.16s]  We're not going to watch this one.
[7412.16s -> 7413.46s]  We've seen this one so many times.
[7413.86s -> 7414.46s]  Like this one.
[7414.46s -> 7415.96s]  I don't want to hear the wait thing.
[7415.96s -> 7417.16s]  We'll watch them all at the end.
[7424.82s -> 7426.02s]  They see the skeleton in there.
[7426.02s -> 7427.12s]  You see the skeleton?
[7431.12s -> 7432.82s]  I don't want to hear that fucking line anymore.
[7441.47s -> 7441.77s]  All right.
[7441.77s -> 7445.17s]  I know now I know how to save and export performances.
[7445.67s -> 7446.67s]  I figured it out.
[7450.97s -> 7452.77s]  Some of these people aren't even alive.
[7453.07s -> 7454.57s]  That's a skeleton in there.
[7461.99s -> 7463.29s]  Yeah, I'm going to put all these awkward.
[7463.29s -> 7464.79s]  I'll do a compilation at the end of the stream.
[7468.35s -> 7470.35s]  It's a 3.4 on Yelp.
[7471.59s -> 7471.89s]  All right.
[7471.89s -> 7472.59s]  Next scene.
[7472.99s -> 7473.79s]  Give me an object.
[7473.89s -> 7474.69s]  Give me a place.
[7474.99s -> 7475.29s]  Oh, no, no.
[7475.29s -> 7476.09s]  I'm going to do the clip thing.
[7476.29s -> 7476.59s]  Right.
[7478.66s -> 7480.36s]  See if I can recreate the clip.
[7490.33s -> 7491.63s]  I do have to do a fight scene too.
[7500.34s -> 7502.04s]  Acknowledge the please for rat movie.
[7502.04s -> 7503.24s]  I can't do all.
[7503.54s -> 7509.31s]  I can't do the whole rat movie guys.
[7509.31s -> 7511.01s]  That's like fucking seven minutes.
[7511.91s -> 7515.31s]  I'm lucky to get one scene done with 30 seconds minute long.
[7521.64s -> 7523.34s]  That was like a painful procedure.
[7529.45s -> 7529.85s]  All right.
[7530.88s -> 7532.28s]  Give me a scene.
[7532.28s -> 7533.38s]  Give me an object.
[7533.38s -> 7533.98s]  Give me a thing.
[7533.98s -> 7534.48s]  Give me a person.
[7534.48s -> 7535.08s]  Give me a place.
[7535.08s -> 7535.58s]  Give me a thing.
[7535.58s -> 7536.18s]  Give me a noun.
[7536.18s -> 7536.68s]  Give me a verb.
[7536.68s -> 7537.38s]  Give me an adjective.
[7537.38s -> 7538.08s]  Give me an adverb.
[7538.08s -> 7540.68s]  Give me a conjunctivitis.
[7547.47s -> 7547.87s]  Force.
[7547.87s -> 7548.07s]  Okay.
[7548.07s -> 7548.57s]  I can't do that.
[7548.57s -> 7548.87s]  Sorry.
[7549.17s -> 7549.57s]  Believe me.
[7551.59s -> 7552.49s]  I'm going to wait for this to be done.
[7573.69s -> 7574.19s]  Go.
[7574.59s -> 7593.27s]  Hey, we're back.
[7603.50s -> 7604.30s]  We don't want to see this.
[7604.30s -> 7605.30s]  Get me out of here quick.
[7606.34s -> 7606.94s]  New scene.
[7606.94s -> 7607.44s]  Clear it.
[7617.19s -> 7617.99s]  Oh shit.
[7618.29s -> 7619.19s]  Oh, God damn it.
[7619.49s -> 7620.69s]  No, that's fine.
[7621.82s -> 7622.82s]  Just in case something goes wrong.
[7624.43s -> 7625.93s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[7626.40s -> 7626.80s]  Okay.
[7626.80s -> 7629.78s]  All right.
[7629.78s -> 7630.28s]  Clear it.
[7631.21s -> 7631.81s]  New place.
[7632.11s -> 7632.81s]  We need a...
[7651.38s -> 7651.78s]  Hello.
[7653.12s -> 7655.22s]  Hello and welcome to another episode.
[7655.52s -> 7656.52s]  Hello and welcome.
[7657.12s -> 7658.32s]  Hello and welcome.
[7659.12s -> 7659.62s]  Hello.
[7695.20s -> 7695.60s]  See you.
[7696.79s -> 7697.19s]  Deaf.
[7702.78s -> 7704.08s]  This one's going to be experimental.
[7704.75s -> 7708.85s]  We're going with an experimental poetry.
[7713.32s -> 7714.42s]  I'm not even doing that.
[7714.62s -> 7715.92s]  Do you see what happened here?
[7715.92s -> 7716.82s]  I'm not doing that.
[7717.95s -> 7719.35s]  I'm not doing that.
[7719.75s -> 7720.55s]  Stop it.
[7730.86s -> 7732.16s]  My father was fairly wealthy.
[7733.53s -> 7736.71s]  He would sometimes come home and shower us with gifts.
[7737.61s -> 7740.41s]  Various toys, trinkets, and the like.
[7742.08s -> 7743.98s]  But my father also brought something else into the house.
[7745.27s -> 7745.87s]  Animals.
[7748.06s -> 7748.96s]  Lots of animals.
[7751.04s -> 7752.84s]  See, he was a zoologist by trade.
[7753.90s -> 7758.27s]  And besides the money, which was great, we had an entire zoo in our backyard.
[7760.10s -> 7763.90s]  Although through the years, one would say that sharing a bed
[7767.72s -> 7771.85s]  with a giraffe is not so great.
[7772.45s -> 7773.15s]  After a while.
[7774.89s -> 7777.80s]  We grow distant, him and I.
[7779.62s -> 7783.72s]  The last time I spoke with him was July of 2006.
[7785.04s -> 7785.74s]  And here's why.
[7787.02s -> 7787.82s]  He killed my mother!
[7787.82s -> 7789.12s]  I don't know.
[7789.12s -> 7790.12s]  That was not enough time.
[7791.92s -> 7792.32s]  What?
[7802.56s -> 7810.64s]  Various toys, trinkets, animals.
[7812.75s -> 7813.75s]  This sucks.
[7816.06s -> 7817.66s]  He was a zoologist by trade.
[7818.81s -> 7823.14s]  And besides the money, which was great, we had an entire zoo in our backyard.
[7824.94s -> 7828.60s]  Although through the years, one would say that sharing a bed
[7835.94s -> 7836.54s]  was not so great.
[7837.24s -> 7838.94s]  I'm not going to do tons of like, cuts and shit.
[7839.64s -> 7840.54s]  We grow distant.
[7841.04s -> 7848.44s]  The last time I spoke with him was July of 2006.
[7849.85s -> 7850.55s]  And here's why.
[7851.74s -> 7852.64s]  He killed my mother!
[7852.64s -> 7853.24s]  I don't know why.
[7855.12s -> 7855.72s]  Are you ready?
[7867.02s -> 7868.12s]  My father was fairly wealthy.
[7877.16s -> 7880.06s]  He would sometimes come home and shower us with gifts.
[7880.96s -> 7883.76s]  Various toys, trinkets, and the like.
[7894.38s -> 7896.08s]  But my father also brought something else into the house.
[7897.50s -> 7898.00s]  Animals.
[7898.40s -> 7901.00s]  Lots of animals.
[7903.50s -> 7905.00s]  He was a zoologist by trade.
[7917.44s -> 7921.58s]  And besides the money, which was great, we had an entire zoo in our backyard.
[7923.48s -> 7927.18s]  Although through the years, one would say that sharing a bed
[7928.88s -> 7929.38s]  Ow!
[7941.56s -> 7942.16s]  was not so great.
[7949.88s -> 7950.68s]  We grow distant.
[7951.18s -> 7958.55s]  The last time I spoke with him was July of 2006.
[7967.30s -> 7967.80s]  And here's why.
[7973.23s -> 7974.13s]  He killed my mother!
[7978.58s -> 7979.58s]  This one sucks.
[7992.41s -> 7993.51s]  My father was fairly wealthy.
[7994.81s -> 7998.08s]  He would sometimes come home and shower us with gifts.
[7999.08s -> 8001.78s]  Various toys, trinkets, and the like.
[8001.78s -> 8005.32s]  But my father also brought something else into the house.
[8006.72s -> 8007.22s]  Animals.
[8012.68s -> 8014.28s]  He was a zoologist by trade.
[8015.68s -> 8019.77s]  And besides the money, which was great, we had an entire zoo in our backyard.
[8021.61s -> 8025.35s]  Although through the years, one would say that sharing a bed
[8027.70s -> 8028.90s]  I'm trying to think of an animal.
[8029.10s -> 8030.60s]  I was so desperately thinking of an animal.
[8033.70s -> 8035.20s]  You can feel the cogs turning there.
[8036.43s -> 8037.23s]  We grow distant.
[8037.73s -> 8045.13s]  The last time I spoke with him was July of 2006.
[8046.61s -> 8047.21s]  And here's why.
[8048.53s -> 8049.33s]  He killed my mother!
[8059.78s -> 8061.98s]  Hey, I make sure to scream at the end.
[8068.14s -> 8069.14s]  Look at this camera work.
[8069.14s -> 8070.04s]  You don't think I know what I'm doing?
[8073.70s -> 8075.60s]  You don't think I didn't go to school for this shit?
[8081.72s -> 8082.42s]  Mods, please.
[8082.42s -> 8082.92s]  What's going on?
[8085.66s -> 8087.26s]  Don't turn that into a coffee pasta.
[8087.26s -> 8088.06s]  Jesus Christ.
[8093.18s -> 8093.68s]  God.
[8101.47s -> 8102.27s]  July of what?
[8103.11s -> 8104.51s]  Various toys, trinkets.
[8104.51s -> 8105.31s]  That was just...
[8106.21s -> 8107.21s]  Alright, so, you know...
[8108.35s -> 8111.85s]  When words just come out, but they mean absolutely nothing.
[8112.85s -> 8114.75s]  Words were just coming out of my mouth.
[8115.73s -> 8117.33s]  And they meant nothing.
[8117.93s -> 8119.43s]  It was just word soup.
[8119.43s -> 8120.43s]  It didn't mean anything.
[8120.43s -> 8121.53s]  It wasn't going anywhere.
[8121.53s -> 8122.53s]  It was just a...
[8122.53s -> 8124.13s]  It was a run-on sentence.
[8144.53s -> 8145.63s]  Fix the audio, DC.
[8145.63s -> 8146.13s]  I don't know what...
[8146.13s -> 8146.43s]  Hold on.
[8146.43s -> 8147.23s]  What are you talking about?
[8150.54s -> 8150.94s]  What are you...
[8150.94s -> 8151.44s]  Hold on.
[8151.44s -> 8151.94s]  Ready? Like...
[8152.94s -> 8156.02s]  It should be...
[8156.02s -> 8156.72s]  There's no sync.
[8161.82s -> 8162.62s]  Game audio.
[8162.62s -> 8163.72s]  That shouldn't be a thing.
[8166.49s -> 8167.89s]  Video has desync.
[8169.54s -> 8169.84s]  Alright.
[8169.84s -> 8171.14s]  But how much?
[8171.94s -> 8175.56s]  Already?
[8176.80s -> 8177.50s]  Let's do a test.
[8178.40s -> 8178.90s]  I wanna see.
[8181.50s -> 8182.70s]  It's three seconds.
[8182.70s -> 8184.30s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[8184.30s -> 8184.80s]  What?
[8186.06s -> 8186.56s]  What?
[8189.10s -> 8191.10s]  It's three seconds of desync?
[8191.10s -> 8192.10s]  No way.
[8193.51s -> 8194.51s]  You gotta be kidding me.
[8194.51s -> 8195.41s]  What the fuck are you...
[8195.41s -> 8195.71s]  What?
[8195.71s -> 8196.61s]  Are you serious?
[8197.91s -> 8198.51s]  Why?
[8198.91s -> 8200.01s]  That doesn't make any sense.
[8201.97s -> 8202.97s]  How does that make any sense?
[8204.17s -> 8204.47s]  Alright.
[8204.47s -> 8204.97s]  Hold on a minute.
[8204.97s -> 8206.07s]  I gotta do some testing here.
[8208.22s -> 8209.22s]  That makes no sense.
[8212.94s -> 8213.84s]  That makes no sense.
[8213.84s -> 8214.74s]  That makes no sense.
[8216.90s -> 8217.20s]  Save it.
[8217.20s -> 8217.80s]  Save this.
[8221.75s -> 8221.95s]  Alright.
[8221.95s -> 8222.45s]  You ready?
[8224.00s -> 8224.30s]  Click.
[8224.50s -> 8224.80s]  Click.
[8225.00s -> 8225.30s]  Click.
[8227.82s -> 8229.22s]  Are you hearing that when I click it?
[8237.11s -> 8238.01s]  It's delayed.
[8239.18s -> 8239.38s]  Alright.
[8239.38s -> 8240.28s]  But by how much?
[8240.38s -> 8241.98s]  So are you hearing the...
[8247.34s -> 8248.44s]  It's actually bad.
[8248.74s -> 8249.94s]  I'm surprised.
[8252.77s -> 8253.07s]  No.
[8253.07s -> 8254.07s]  It is not five seconds.
[8254.47s -> 8256.67s]  Click comes way later in the video.
[8256.67s -> 8258.57s]  That's fucking strange.
[8259.41s -> 8260.61s]  That's strange.
[8262.88s -> 8263.08s]  Alright.
[8263.08s -> 8264.08s]  Hold on a second here.
[8265.63s -> 8267.43s]  So it comes way later.
[8269.75s -> 8270.95s]  It's like two seconds?
[8276.37s -> 8277.37s]  It's actually a couple...
[8277.37s -> 8278.47s]  That makes no sense.
[8279.34s -> 8280.14s]  Because of my...
[8285.78s -> 8286.78s]  It's to do with the game.
[8286.78s -> 8287.08s]  No.
[8287.08s -> 8287.48s]  That's weird.
[8287.48s -> 8288.88s]  Because on my screen it looks fine.
[8289.68s -> 8290.78s]  Let me see if I can delay this.
[8291.58s -> 8292.08s]  So...
[8293.02s -> 8294.32s]  Tell me if this changes anything.
[8299.90s -> 8300.70s]  I'm sorry guys.
[8300.70s -> 8301.50s]  That's really weird.
[8306.73s -> 8308.13s]  Tell me if this changes anything.
[8309.71s -> 8310.11s]  Ready?
[8311.27s -> 8311.67s]  Click.
[8311.87s -> 8312.17s]  Click.
[8312.27s -> 8312.77s]  Click.
[8312.77s -> 8313.27s]  Click.
[8313.27s -> 8313.77s]  Click.
[8313.77s -> 8314.27s]  Click.
[8314.37s -> 8314.87s]  Click.
[8314.87s -> 8315.37s]  Click.
[8315.37s -> 8315.87s]  Click.
[8322.42s -> 8323.22s]  Now it's worse.
[8323.62s -> 8325.75s]  Hold on a sec.
[8333.92s -> 8334.72s]  Let me try this.
[8335.84s -> 8336.74s]  I'm gonna try something here.
[8339.08s -> 8340.28s]  Tell me if this changes anything.
[8350.46s -> 8351.06s]  I gotta add a...
[8351.06s -> 8352.26s]  I'm gonna add a filter on it.
[8352.46s -> 8353.76s]  And see if I can just make it...
[8355.28s -> 8356.08s]  That's annoying.
[8356.08s -> 8356.58s]  Damn.
[8360.43s -> 8360.93s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[8360.93s -> 8362.43s]  Restart the game and it'll be fixed.
[8362.43s -> 8363.43s]  It's a known issue.
[8363.43s -> 8364.63s]  Oh, are you kidding me?
[8365.23s -> 8367.48s]  Okay.
[8371.98s -> 8372.48s]  Okay.
[8372.48s -> 8372.98s]  Alright.
[8374.81s -> 8375.61s]  I'm gonna restart.
[8375.61s -> 8376.11s]  We'll try it again.
[8376.11s -> 8376.81s]  I saved that one.
[8376.81s -> 8378.01s]  So that one's ready to watch later.
[8378.41s -> 8380.01s]  Let me make sure these are actually coming out okay.
[8380.01s -> 8384.51s]  Because this would be a disaster if later on I put a giant like 8-minute compilation and they all suck.
[8384.91s -> 8385.81s]  They all don't do anything.
[8394.27s -> 8394.87s]  No, that's good.
[8408.66s -> 8409.46s]  Well, they work.
[8409.46s -> 8410.56s]  I'll just put it that way.
[8417.10s -> 8417.80s]  Alright, we're good.
[8419.76s -> 8421.56s]  I'm gonna restart the game apparently.
[8426.49s -> 8427.49s]  Jerma is upset.
[8427.69s -> 8428.89s]  No, I just wanna make sure it's not...
[8429.39s -> 8430.89s]  It's not like a huge delay.
[8432.47s -> 8432.87s]  You know?
[8434.32s -> 8435.52s]  That'd be like kind of hard to watch.
[8437.01s -> 8438.71s]  Great Canadian Fuck Club 5 community subs.
[8438.71s -> 8439.61s]  Thanks a lot, Great Canadian.
[8441.58s -> 8442.28s]  Thank you for the five.
[8442.98s -> 8444.48s]  I've not been paying much attention to bit...
[8444.48s -> 8445.38s]  I really can't.
[8445.88s -> 8448.08s]  Streamlabs has turned off for VR.
[8448.85s -> 8449.55s]  As you're aware.
[8451.44s -> 8453.04s]  Let's reopen it and see if it fixes it.
[8458.49s -> 8458.99s]  Get in there.
[8459.90s -> 8460.50s]  Get in there.
[8462.81s -> 8463.51s]  Get in there.
[8464.45s -> 8465.15s]  Get in there!
[8470.34s -> 8470.84s]  Okay.
[8471.77s -> 8472.37s]  You tell me.
[8482.72s -> 8483.42s]  Hey, thanks.
[8483.42s -> 8484.52s]  Welcome to Mind Show.
[8485.32s -> 8485.92s]  Okay, you ready?
[8488.22s -> 8488.72s]  You tell me.
[8494.59s -> 8495.39s]  You should be hearing like...
[8497.49s -> 8502.62s]  My chat.
[8517.10s -> 8517.40s]  It's...
[8518.57s -> 8520.07s]  I have no idea why the fuck that's happening.
[8529.29s -> 8530.99s]  It's the game audio that's delayed.
[8532.41s -> 8533.61s]  I wonder if I should just...
[8535.06s -> 8536.46s]  Delay all the audio then.
[8540.08s -> 8541.18s]  Let me see what it sounds like.
[8544.12s -> 8544.92s]  That's really odd.
[8547.87s -> 8548.27s]  Ready?
[8548.47s -> 8557.85s]  I'm ready.
[8558.15s -> 8576.09s]  I have no words for why that's happening.
[8576.09s -> 8576.39s]  Hold on.
[8576.39s -> 8577.19s]  Let me try something.
[8584.78s -> 8587.18s]  That's like a six second fucking delay.
[8589.82s -> 8590.42s]  Alright, hold on.
[8590.42s -> 8590.82s]  Ready?
[8592.52s -> 8593.92s]  Can I delay this?
[8598.27s -> 8600.27s]  Yeah, I'm gonna delay the video and mix the audio.
[8602.54s -> 8603.04s]  Jesus.
[8605.86s -> 8606.36s]  Why can I...
[8606.36s -> 8607.66s]  I can't add a filter on here.
[8613.56s -> 8614.56s]  I need to delay.
[8619.48s -> 8620.58s]  So if you're hearing it like...
[8620.58s -> 8621.48s]  Let me see if this works.
[8626.41s -> 8627.21s]  Tell me how this works.
[8627.21s -> 8627.51s]  Ready?
[8630.20s -> 8630.70s]  I'm sorry.
[8630.70s -> 8630.90s]  I...
[8630.90s -> 8632.70s]  This is an issue I've never run into before.
[8633.82s -> 8634.22s]  Alright, ready?
[8634.22s -> 8634.92s]  So it's like...
[8636.92s -> 8638.02s]  Let's just say it's like this.
[8641.00s -> 8642.70s]  And put the mic delayed too.
[8649.30s -> 8650.00s]  So now...
[8652.59s -> 8653.79s]  You tell me if this change...
[8653.79s -> 8655.69s]  That it's gonna be delayed even worse.
[8658.97s -> 8661.77s]  Because now my motions will be delayed but the audio won't.
[8662.37s -> 8662.77s]  Ready?
[8663.27s -> 8664.67s]  One, two, three.
[8665.61s -> 8666.01s]  One.
[8672.79s -> 8673.79s]  Nah, it's even worse now.
[8678.86s -> 8679.36s]  Why would...
[8679.56s -> 8680.46s]  Why would that be happening?
[8687.06s -> 8688.46s]  Restarting SteamVR?
[8688.56s -> 8689.76s]  Yeah, maybe I'll try that.
[8702.37s -> 8705.37s]  This just started happening after you recorded the ghost character.
[8705.37s -> 8705.77s]  Okay.
[8706.27s -> 8706.67s]  So...
[8708.62s -> 8709.12s]  Let me...
[8709.82s -> 8711.42s]  Let me try a couple things.
[8711.42s -> 8712.52s]  I apologize everybody.
[8714.48s -> 8715.58s]  Give me like a couple minutes.
[8715.58s -> 8716.48s]  I'm gonna be right back.
[8717.52s -> 8719.02s]  Let me like try to get this fixed.
[8719.32s -> 8720.72s]  I'm gonna restart SteamVR.
[8722.89s -> 8723.99s]  And I mean, of course.
[8725.03s -> 8725.93s]  Get another one of these.
[8736.59s -> 8736.99s]  Fuck.
[8737.85s -> 8740.15s]  Well, this is gonna be a technical troubleshooting stream.
[8744.18s -> 8744.88s]  God damn it.
[8747.10s -> 8747.90s]  Alright, I'll be right back.
[8749.28s -> 8750.18s]  See if I can get this fixed.
[9036.52s -> 9037.92s]  Alright, come on.
[9039.22s -> 9040.42s]  Don't do it to me.
[9041.22s -> 9042.42s]  Don't do this to me.
[9043.79s -> 9046.59s]  I've got so much going on right now in the VR.
[9049.56s -> 9049.96s]  Fuck.
[9051.36s -> 9051.96s]  I'm trying.
[9054.26s -> 9055.36s]  I'm trying.
[9056.71s -> 9057.81s]  The effort is here.
[9061.36s -> 9062.06s]  Come on, work.
[9062.06s -> 9066.27s]  Get back on camera so we can test it again.
[9070.94s -> 9071.94s]  Yeah, um...
[9072.61s -> 9074.21s]  I really don't know what to do with my hair.
[9074.51s -> 9076.11s]  I was thinking maybe let it grow out a little.
[9076.51s -> 9078.61s]  And then maybe you can trim it and change it a little.
[9081.33s -> 9082.23s]  Uh, sir.
[9083.32s -> 9084.72s]  Sir, this isn't human hair.
[9086.42s -> 9087.12s]  Oh, I know.
[9087.12s -> 9089.42s]  But I took a little bit of uncooked spaghetti.
[9089.82s -> 9091.32s]  And then put it on here.
[9091.72s -> 9092.62s]  Can you still do something with it?
[9092.62s -> 9093.52s]  Can you still work with it?
[9095.80s -> 9096.50s]  That's an old joke.
[9096.50s -> 9097.30s]  He said that before.
[9099.26s -> 9100.36s]  Welcome to Mind Show.
[9100.36s -> 9101.46s]  Shaved your beard?
[9103.38s -> 9103.68s]  No.
[9104.54s -> 9106.14s]  I'm gonna grow it until it's on the fucking floor.
[9109.96s -> 9110.66s]  That was an old joke.
[9110.66s -> 9110.96s]  It was.
[9110.96s -> 9111.26s]  I know.
[9111.36s -> 9112.06s]  Who cares?
[9112.36s -> 9113.26s]  This is just what happens.
[9116.02s -> 9117.92s]  My appearance is at the bottom of the ladder right now.
[9118.02s -> 9119.72s]  Stream functioning is up here.
[9120.22s -> 9120.92s]  Appearance?
[9121.02s -> 9121.62s]  Who cares?
[9123.77s -> 9125.17s]  I don't want this delay to be a fucking thing.
[9127.38s -> 9128.18s]  Pubic hair.
[9130.71s -> 9132.01s]  Nah, I was gonna give you the finger.
[9132.01s -> 9133.01s]  I was thinking about it.
[9135.26s -> 9136.56s]  Oh, I was thinking it was supposed to come up.
[9136.86s -> 9137.16s]  See?
[9137.46s -> 9138.56s]  Oh, I'm trying to keep it.
[9138.56s -> 9139.46s]  Just don't do that.
[9139.76s -> 9140.46s]  Okay, we're fine.
[9148.33s -> 9149.43s]  Uh, you guys are gonna have to help me.
[9149.43s -> 9150.53s]  Let's see if I can test it.
[9156.94s -> 9157.54s]  All right.
[9158.50s -> 9159.20s]  You tell me.
[9160.78s -> 9161.48s]  Are we fixed?
[9163.26s -> 9163.66s]  Ready?
[9166.15s -> 9170.28s]  Click, click, click, click, click, click.
[9177.29s -> 9185.90s]  No, it happened.
[9189.06s -> 9190.16s]  What the fuck happened?
[9192.73s -> 9194.03s]  I don't understand what happened.
[9194.23s -> 9197.53s]  You tell me this started after I went into the ghost thing?
[9198.69s -> 9200.19s]  I restarted SteamVR.
[9202.45s -> 9203.55s]  It's even lighter now.
[9206.66s -> 9207.26s]  Shit.
[9213.03s -> 9214.93s]  I'm gonna try one more thing and we're just gonna move on.
[9214.93s -> 9215.43s]  We're gonna go.
[9216.03s -> 9216.53s]  I got to.
[9216.53s -> 9218.53s]  I can't just fucking do this all day, you know, guys.
[9218.53s -> 9219.03s]  Sorry.
[9222.97s -> 9225.57s]  I can't just like do this all fucking day.
[9226.27s -> 9226.87s]  God damn it.
[9227.17s -> 9228.07s]  Let me try one more thing.
[9233.00s -> 9233.50s]  Hold on.
[9235.17s -> 9235.87s]  Shit.
[9237.41s -> 9240.41s]  Delay all the other audio and yeah, but I tried that before and
[9241.55s -> 9242.55s]  you can't queue it up.
[9245.31s -> 9247.11s]  Validate the game files for Mind Show.
[9249.08s -> 9250.08s]  I was having a lot of fun too.
[9250.08s -> 9250.88s]  God damn it.
[9251.28s -> 9252.18s]  I don't know what's going on.
[9255.36s -> 9256.56s]  Let me reboot again.
[9260.48s -> 9261.58s]  That was going somewhere too.
[9261.58s -> 9262.18s]  It really was.
[9270.17s -> 9272.47s]  Let's reboot VR again.
[9273.78s -> 9274.48s]  There it goes.
[9276.02s -> 9276.92s]  Let's see what happens.
[9283.48s -> 9285.68s]  I have to kill the chat too.
[9285.68s -> 9286.58s]  So sorry guys.
[9287.18s -> 9289.48s]  I won't be able to see what you're saying for testing purposes.
[9296.21s -> 9297.31s]  Welcome to Mind Show.
[9299.60s -> 9300.60s]  Last attempt.
[9301.53s -> 9304.93s]  Before I have to kind of, I guess just have to deal with it.
[9304.93s -> 9305.43s]  Maybe.
[9311.71s -> 9312.21s]  Ready?
[9316.86s -> 9319.16s]  Is this fixed?
[9323.73s -> 9324.33s]  We good?
[9328.17s -> 9329.87s]  Yeah, it's fixed.
[9333.07s -> 9333.77s]  Yeah.
[9335.69s -> 9336.29s]  Are you sure?
[9343.16s -> 9345.06s]  Hey, piece of pie.
[9345.16s -> 9345.46s]  Good?
[9345.66s -> 9347.17s]  I don't fuck.
[9347.17s -> 9348.17s]  What the hell was that?
[9348.27s -> 9352.05s]  I've been doing this for almost 10 years, right?
[9352.45s -> 9354.55s]  And sometimes like shit just don't make no sense.
[9354.95s -> 9356.65s]  It doesn't matter how much you try to get ready for something
[9356.65s -> 9358.65s]  to prepare and that shit makes no sense.
[9359.25s -> 9360.05s]  What happened?
[9361.03s -> 9362.63s]  I don't understand.
[9363.67s -> 9364.67s]  Fucking computers.
[9364.77s -> 9365.77s]  Don't ever buy one.
[9366.44s -> 9367.24s]  Just read a newspaper.
[9367.24s -> 9367.94s]  Do the crosswords.
[9367.94s -> 9368.64s]  Don't buy it.
[9368.74s -> 9369.94s]  Oh, I'm shredding off.
[9370.24s -> 9370.54s]  What?
[9371.44s -> 9372.44s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[9372.44s -> 9372.64s]  What?
[9372.64s -> 9373.24s]  What's going on?
[9375.62s -> 9376.92s]  I didn't do anything.
[9377.52s -> 9379.22s]  I was playing the game and my computer.
[9379.72s -> 9380.82s]  Just only do crosswords.
[9380.82s -> 9382.02s]  Don't ever fucking buy a computer.
[9383.66s -> 9385.66s]  German, do you have any like specs I should buy?
[9385.66s -> 9387.76s]  Yeah, it's called fucking a book.
[9388.46s -> 9389.66s]  Go read Lord of the Rings.
[9390.43s -> 9391.43s]  Don't buy a computer.
[9392.81s -> 9393.11s]  All right.
[9393.11s -> 9393.61s]  I'm ready.
[9394.58s -> 9397.58s]  I can't do OVR drop right now.
[9398.08s -> 9399.78s]  I can't do the chat here yet.
[9400.18s -> 9400.98s]  We got to move on.
[9400.98s -> 9402.78s]  I got to make something and we'll go back to it.
[9404.00s -> 9404.90s]  I'm sorry guys.
[9405.20s -> 9406.40s]  I can't see the chat anymore.
[9406.50s -> 9407.50s]  Maybe that was the problem.
[9409.44s -> 9410.34s]  That might have been fucked up.
[9410.34s -> 9412.44s]  I don't know because I didn't have it on here.
[9414.25s -> 9414.95s]  Fuck.
[9417.62s -> 9418.22s]  What a disaster.
[9418.22s -> 9419.52s]  It's been like fucking 30 minutes.
[9420.76s -> 9422.96s]  Thank you for sticking around.
[9423.73s -> 9425.93s]  There was like 4,400, 4,300.
[9425.93s -> 9427.53s]  There's still like 4,000 people here almost.
[9428.33s -> 9428.73s]  Thanks.
[9429.93s -> 9431.73s]  Glad you could sit through this fucking nonsense.
[9431.73s -> 9432.23s]  Thank you.
[9432.83s -> 9433.33s]  Let's go.
[9437.53s -> 9438.03s]  I'm ready.
[9444.68s -> 9445.88s]  That wine is so gross.
[9449.98s -> 9456.37s]  I mean it just smells the way that tastes.
[9456.37s -> 9456.97s]  You know what I mean?
[9456.97s -> 9457.67s]  Like what the?
[9460.36s -> 9460.86s]  I'm ready.
[9462.58s -> 9463.98s]  I can't see you guys reactions.
[9463.98s -> 9464.68s]  I don't like this.
[9467.48s -> 9468.88s]  I need like reactions, man.
[9468.88s -> 9469.98s]  I'm a reaction streamer.
[9472.35s -> 9474.35s]  Dude, can you fucking believe what that thing is?
[9474.45s -> 9475.15s]  What the fuck?
[9475.15s -> 9476.05s]  I got shit in my eye.
[9476.05s -> 9477.35s]  God, no, I don't care.

[9481.95s -> 9482.35s]  I'm ready.
[9482.35s -> 9483.15s]  Create show.
[9488.00s -> 9488.60s]  Where are you?
[9489.91s -> 9492.72s]  I can't see anybody ready for this one.
[9499.23s -> 9499.63s]  I got it.
[9501.04s -> 9501.54s]  Oh, what?

[9544.52s -> 9545.02s]  Okay.
[9545.83s -> 9547.63s]  So who has the mythic key to do this?
[9548.33s -> 9549.53s]  We're a mythic plus eight.

[9564.24s -> 9566.04s]  On my resume, it's guild leader.
[9567.47s -> 9568.27s]  This can be tough.

[9597.84s -> 9598.74s]  No, no, no, no, no.

[9641.62s -> 9642.32s]  You're the key holder.
[9642.32s -> 9643.62s]  Just open the fucking door.
[9643.62s -> 9644.12s]  I've got...
[9644.12s -> 9646.02s]  My baby's going to be born in 45 minutes.
[9646.02s -> 9646.92s]  Are you listening to me?
[9648.18s -> 9649.58s]  It's fucking raw.

[9814.49s -> 9820.78s]  Today, two more tech demos came out for VR and nobody fucking uses it.
[9821.28s -> 9825.28s]  Not one AAA developer has made anything for this platform.
[9825.58s -> 9831.08s]  So we're left to make our own fucking movies in this kind of little fun little show game.
[9832.34s -> 9833.04s]  That's bad too.
[9834.04s -> 9838.60s]  Welcome to VR news.
[9838.90s -> 9839.50s]  I'm LD.
[9839.50s -> 9840.90s]  I don't want to hear that one again.
[9850.05s -> 9850.45s]  Hey everybody.
[9850.45s -> 9851.45s]  Welcome to the show here.
[9851.65s -> 9853.55s]  As you can tell, we're on IGN.com.
[9853.65s -> 9854.35s]  No, don't do that.
[9854.35s -> 9855.05s]  That's bad too.
[9855.25s -> 9856.15s]  Don't fucking say that.
[9856.95s -> 9858.63s]  Don't do that one.
[9859.13s -> 9863.51s]  I mean, I was going to do a thing where it's like playing on the GameStop TVs.
[9863.51s -> 9863.91s]  No, no, no, no.

[9891.98s -> 9899.28s]  Terrible winds have hit the coast of Las Vegas as we will hear from our weather report here from Dave the Dragon.
[9899.28s -> 9900.88s]  Dave the Dragon, how's the weather looking over there?
[9900.98s -> 9904.38s]  Well, you see, if you can take a look over here, this is the moon.
[9904.38s -> 9908.28s]  This is not even Las Vegas, but the sun is going to come crashing down.
[9908.28s -> 9913.38s]  I mean, you're mentioning winds, but you're not mentioning the fact that Las Vegas is going to be wiped out by the meteor.
[9913.48s -> 9915.08s]  I bumped my hand on the table.
[9915.28s -> 9920.08s]  No, table, but that's the thing about the interdimensional fucking shit.

[9971.58s -> 9972.88s]  I got a better fucking idea for you.
[9973.48s -> 10004.77s]  All right, we're good.

[10032.07s -> 10035.07s]  First of all, World of Warcraft has been cancelled.
[10035.47s -> 10036.07s]  That's right.
[10036.07s -> 10040.57s]  Their subscriber numbers have dropped so much that they can't even keep anybody around.
[10040.77s -> 10046.07s]  They got WoW Classic coming up, but nobody's going to play that because WoW Classic wasn't even very fun.
[10046.27s -> 10048.87s]  Everybody thinks that it was fun, but we're going to...
[10049.17s -> 10050.27s]  No, you know what it is?
[10050.47s -> 10051.57s]  It's the fucking time limit.
[10051.57s -> 10052.07s]  Go back and...
[10053.77s -> 10055.17s]  I got to do the lab shit.

[10067.00s -> 10067.80s]  This one will be good.
[10070.80s -> 10072.00s]  I've like lost it.
[10072.20s -> 10073.80s]  Oh my comedy is gone.
[10073.80s -> 10075.90s]  I got nothing funny left in my body.
[10078.59s -> 10079.79s]  Check this, it's even worse.
[10080.79s -> 10081.49s]  Dragon over here.
[10081.79s -> 10082.89s]  It's 45 minutes.

[10093.29s -> 10093.79s]  What is it?
[10093.79s -> 10096.19s]  Oh, I'm having a problem with my sinking issue if I straight...
[10108.98s -> 10134.33s]  I like it.

[10915.16s -> 10916.46s]  I don't even have my Twitter password.
[10925.72s -> 10927.82s]  I don't even know my password.
[10933.39s -> 10934.89s]  What if I videotape it and film it?
[10934.89s -> 10935.89s]  No, it's not going to work.
[10943.08s -> 10943.98s]  I have no idea.
[10948.82s -> 10949.62s]  I'll do it later.
[10950.22s -> 10953.42s]  I will upload this video with no context, no message, nothing.
[10954.56s -> 10955.16s]  Guys, okay.

[10984.08s -> 10985.98s]  There's a difference between tweeting out your stream and
[10985.98s -> 10987.28s]  making like an actual tweet.

[11759.81s -> 11777.38s]  render this and we'll try it again I restarted steam VR before let me render this let
[11777.38s -> 11783.25s]  me get the right camera angles that I want it's hard to really make like a full thing
[11783.25s -> 11788.18s]  in a minute you know I mean like you got I get there's a lot I want to condense what
[11788.18s -> 11792.90s]  I'm gonna have to do so the next thing I'm gonna do is one minute per scene and we're
[11792.90s -> 11797.74s]  gonna have to watch them all back-to-back I wish I could extend that timer I feel
[11797.74s -> 11803.85s]  like I could do way more all right so let's get the camera here okay let's
[11803.85s -> 11812.78s]  open this up here right here
[11861.29s -> 11873.35s]  I got it nice job kids so who wants to tell me about their day who wants to tell me what
[11873.35s -> 11874.35s]  they did today
[11874.35s -> 11932.74s]  I went to a field trip today and the teacher called on me and said that I had the best
[11932.74s -> 11954.14s]  time fuck I need a part two
[11954.14s -> 11993.86s]  I don't know what to do I don't know what to do I don't know what to do I don't know
[11993.86s -> 12022.50s]  what to do I don't know what to do I don't know what to do I don't know what to do
[12023.06s -> 12033.45s]  all right what did you do is the last thing we're gonna wait for that to render
[12033.45s -> 12041.72s]  what did you do now it's time for time for to speak desync whatever yeah
[12041.72s -> 12052.41s]  export a video well let me get this done that's so sad so every single time
[12052.41s -> 12062.98s]  I export a video the desync gets exponentially worse just stop exporting
[12062.98s -> 12071.65s]  videos apparently oh well still fun can I export all of them at the end I don't
[12071.65s -> 12087.58s]  think so this is called mind show untitled 3 so look I gotta get one more
[12087.58s -> 12097.29s]  one minute we're gonna get the broccoli's answer and we'll go on I'm
[12097.29s -> 12099.89s]  not sure if saving them is it and then doing it off stream is a good
[12099.89s -> 12111.71s]  idea because it seems like it seems like you only get this one instance
[12111.83s -> 12123.06s]  of the scene am I correct on that just watch yeah that's true I could just watch
[12123.06s -> 12124.90s]  it but that we had a problem with that before too
[12124.90s -> 12130.58s]  remember I tried to play the last one you just wouldn't play it was skipping

[12174.45s -> 12223.26s]  feels really out of place all right the next thing I'm gonna do is singing I'm
