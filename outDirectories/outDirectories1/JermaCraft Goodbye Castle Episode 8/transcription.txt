[0.31s -> 14.71s]  Hey, what's going on everybody? Welcome back to Germacraft. I know it's been a quite a
[14.71s -> 19.11s]  while since I came up with a Germacraft episode, but I'm going to give you a whole list of
[19.11s -> 27.10s]  excuses right now. All right. So the holidays were around and why am I holding my bed? What
[27.10s -> 34.86s]  happened last episode? Did I, did I, my bed should be in here, right? Yes. Okay. So what
[34.86s -> 39.86s]  happened is obviously the holidays came around and I didn't really have a whole lot of time
[39.86s -> 44.14s]  to play this game because it takes a while. You got to sit down and really do stuff for
[44.14s -> 48.56s]  a couple hours. And I didn't really have that couple hours to really sit down and play.
[48.56s -> 55.68s]  So, but now I do. So let's start playing, huh? What, what is going on here? What is
[55.68s -> 62.19s]  going on with the side of my house? Jeez Louise. Oh, okay. I know I want that there.
[62.19s -> 67.88s]  I want that there. So today we're going to do a couple of things in this episode. I'm
[67.88s -> 74.87s]  going to do this. I'm going to go on a grand adventure because obviously if you watched
[74.87s -> 80.77s]  from the very beginning in episode one, I said, Oh, don't worry. By Christmas time,
[80.77s -> 87.05s]  I'll have a castle. And as you can completely, totally tell that is absolutely not happening
[87.05s -> 91.94s]  and did not happen. So I'm going to go out and go on a crazy adventure and try to kill
[91.94s -> 98.78s]  a bunch of stuff. Okay. I got the sword now. We're good. Do I need anything else? Oh, got
[98.78s -> 106.74s]  to eat this rotten flesh before I die. Keep eating it. Oh yeah. Poisoned. So let's, let's
[106.74s -> 110.22s]  just go. I'm going to go out there. I'm going to try and find, I'm going to try and find
[110.22s -> 118.30s]  a new spot to hang out. Cause in reality, realistically, this is just too far away from
[118.30s -> 123.84s]  all of civilization. So I'm going to have to find somewhere else. So say goodbye to
[123.84s -> 128.47s]  this house for now. I don't think, I don't know if I'll ever come back to it or not,
[129.15s -> 135.82s]  but yeah, let's say goodbye. Let's wave to the stupid sea house that never really went
[135.82s -> 143.10s]  anywhere. So I'm going to sing a goodbye song to the castle that never was. So as we see
[143.10s -> 147.79s]  it in the distance there, let's all wave goodbye to it. Goodbye. And let's sing my song to
[147.79s -> 157.91s]  the castle. It starts raining. It started raining. Oh my God. Perfect.
[162.10s -> 179.17s]  My castle never ended up completing. And I'm scared of what's going to happen in the
[179.17s -> 186.89s]  next episode. But it's okay if we stay true to each other. We get up on a mountainside
[186.89s -> 195.98s]  and find some other place to live. Goodbye castle. I got to find my way up and down the
[195.98s -> 202.18s]  stairs. I'm going to find my way inside of this mountain cab. We're going to go goodbye
[202.18s -> 212.13s]  castle. And that's how we go. We end the song there. Let's just, why am I going this way?
[212.13s -> 222.09s]  Goodbye castle. It was great knowing you. Let's go. You're probably wondering why I'm
[222.09s -> 226.73s]  back in the castle. It's because I didn't take any of the stuff that I'm supposed to
[226.73s -> 234.37s]  take. I left it all here. So I'm going to take that. That stuff can stay. I need the
[234.37s -> 240.01s]  bed though. The bed is an absolute must and I didn't, I left without it. So okay, bye.
[240.01s -> 248.02s]  Bye now castle. Bye. Trying to get up this whole mountain here is kind of being a little
[248.02s -> 252.32s]  more difficult than I initially thought it was going to be. I have to scale this whole
[252.32s -> 259.53s]  mountain and I'm trying to do that. And while it's cold here, oh well, I'm trying to jump
[259.53s -> 266.38s]  up here. I just can't get over here. Maybe I should just make it. I'm like really seriously
[266.38s -> 273.34s]  trying to think of a good way to do this. How to make it. Maybe I should make the next
[273.34s -> 280.42s]  house on top of this mountain maybe? I don't know, but I'm, whoa, what, what? Oh God, I'm
[280.42s -> 286.46s]  starving to death again. How many times is this going to happen to me? Eating raw beef.
[286.46s -> 291.10s]  Oh my, you know what, I'm going to eat the whole damn thing. Oh hey, that's my ring tone.
[291.10s -> 297.58s]  Hold on, somebody's calling me. My ring tone is a duck, if you can hear that. Hold on,
[297.58s -> 311.22s]  I've got to answer this. Hold on. Hello? Hi mom. What's up? I'm making a commentary for
[311.22s -> 319.13s]  YouTube. Yeah, so I made it on top of the mountain. That's a good thing. So do I build
[319.13s -> 324.41s]  my house here is the real question. I don't know, I know, you know what, I'm going to
[324.41s -> 329.41s]  build it down here because this is just going to be a pain in the ass if I ever decide to
[329.41s -> 334.60s]  do anything. So I'm going to come down here. I'm going to die if I jump down there. Do
[334.60s -> 338.56s]  not die. If I die right now, it is a very, very bad thing because I really don't want
[339.56s -> 345.48s]  to come all the way back here again. All right, we're good. We're doing some scaling, some
[345.48s -> 350.82s]  good mountains. Oh, look at that. Look at that parkour. All right, right here. I'm going
[350.82s -> 355.85s]  to do it right here. The house is going to be built right here. Good shore view. Got
[355.85s -> 361.07s]  a nice little spot right here. Going right here. Eventually, I'm sure I'll put wood here.
[361.07s -> 367.70s]  Or maybe I might even just go back to the old house to, you know, scavenge the supplies.
[367.78s -> 374.19s]  I don't know. But I had to get out of that place. That place was ridiculous. And that
[374.19s -> 381.75s]  reminds me of a story. Story time. Okay. We can talk about story time right now. So when
[382.71s -> 386.78s]  I say get out of this place, it brought me back to when I was in college. When I was
[386.78s -> 392.35s]  in college, hold on, let me, because I got plenty of dirt. I can make a little quasi
[392.35s -> 399.66s]  fake house. Okay. So when I was in college, I lived in the dormitories for a couple years,
[400.72s -> 404.64s]  and then I decided to move, obviously, when you're like a junior and a senior in college,
[404.64s -> 408.00s]  you want to move to like the bigger, cooler, like apartments, because you want to be like
[408.00s -> 413.20s]  a cool person. Like I'm not in the dorm. I'm in the apartments, because I'm the man. That's
[413.20s -> 417.94s]  kind of what goes through your head sometimes. So I got an apartment, and I got the apartment
[417.94s -> 422.78s]  without looking at it. I didn't really know, because I was late to put my thing in to get
[422.78s -> 426.22s]  signed up for the dormitories. So I kind of had no choice. I had to just kind of run and
[426.22s -> 431.72s]  find an apartment last minute. And I found this little place. I didn't see it. I just
[431.72s -> 437.05s]  knew that it existed. It was about, I don't know, maybe half a mile away from the college.
[437.05s -> 441.01s]  So I made a phone call, got the whole thing secured. Okay, let me get the lease. Where
[441.01s -> 445.53s]  is it? Blah, blah, blah. And I came to realize, I came to find out later, when I actually
[445.53s -> 451.14s]  went there, that it was a box. The place wasn't even a house. It was just literally a box
[451.14s -> 457.50s]  like this. Just like, it was like this big. It was one little, it was a studio apartment,
[457.54s -> 463.57s]  right? So it was one small room with a bathroom like right over there. And it was horrible.
[463.57s -> 468.53s]  And I had to live there. I had to share it with somebody. So I had this one box room
[468.53s -> 474.21s]  that was probably, I'm going to be realistic, it was probably really as big as this Minecraft
[474.21s -> 478.25s]  room I just made. And I had to share it with two people. Well, one person, so we had two
[478.25s -> 483.89s]  people in there. But I just remember that it was one of the most ridiculous things ever,
[483.89s -> 489.41s]  and I had to stay there for the whole year. So I guess the moral of the story is if you're
[490.37s -> 494.71s]  going to live somewhere, make sure you like check out where it is first, besides like
[494.71s -> 499.52s]  just buying it and being like, yeah, I'll show up, thanks. Because I had a lot of bad
[499.52s -> 506.06s]  experiences there. It just got to me after a while. It just stressed me out. The fact
[506.06s -> 511.50s]  that there was just this tiny little room, and I couldn't have, I had no privacy, I was
[511.50s -> 516.34s]  sitting right next to the person that lived right next to me. So it really, really was
[516.34s -> 521.63s]  a real pain in the ass. And yeah, but that's the story of Jerma's box house that he really
[521.63s -> 527.83s]  actually existed and lived in. I eventually moved out of there, though. I got out and
[527.83s -> 532.32s]  I went back to live with some of my friends in college. But yeah, don't ever buy real
[532.32s -> 538.66s]  estate without seeing it, or you'll puke. All right, let's get this thing. This should
[538.66s -> 545.45s]  be the last layer right here. And then I should be able to make the roof, put the bed down,
[545.45s -> 548.24s]  put a couple lights in it, and go to sleep.
