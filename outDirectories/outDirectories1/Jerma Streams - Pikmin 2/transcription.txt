[0.50s -> 11.35s]  Does it work? You guys see the stream. What happened? 25 million...
[12.82s -> 19.98s]  late? Yes. What? I was? Oh. I was just testing the stream.
[24.50s -> 29.94s]  Look, if you lose by 7 seconds, you still lost. If you lost by 4 seconds, you still lose.
[31.51s -> 34.79s]  I hate to tell you that, but that's... Hey, look, if you get...
[35.91s -> 42.39s]  If you get Blackjack at the table, and the dealer gets Blackjack too, I'm sorry, you didn't win.
[42.47s -> 59.48s]  I know it feels kind of horrible. I trusted you. Double Blackjack? I did not do that on purpose.
[59.48s -> 66.39s]  I really didn't. Hello, everybody. How are you? Let me just make a tweet. Today, we are going to
[66.39s -> 74.65s]  play a video game. I know that yesterday we had some problems. It has been essentially confirmed
[74.65s -> 80.25s]  for me, even though nobody confirmed it. I confirmed it myself with just how I feel about
[80.25s -> 85.94s]  the situation. There was something wrong with where the traffic was coming from for some
[85.94s -> 91.46s]  streamers to the Twitch ingest servers. I know I wasn't the only one. I remember Ludwig was
[91.46s -> 96.82s]  talking about it. We both had the problem yesterday. It's working now. There's not a
[96.82s -> 103.08s]  problem now. We got the free space. Why are you playing Bingo? I'm playing Pikmin today.
[103.08s -> 113.16s]  This is not a Bingo stream. Yeah, I got Pikmin 2s ready to go. I have the Wii version. I don't
[113.16s -> 117.72s]  know if that's a bad thing or not. People are going to be really pissed off that I have the
[117.72s -> 124.04s]  Wii version, not the GameCube version, but that's the way it is. It's been upscaled from 480p to
[124.04s -> 136.07s]  like 520p. Those extra 40 resolution pixels are worth it for me, okay? Let me grab my drink. I'll
[136.07s -> 220.89s]  be right back. Two seconds. Also, I made a mistake here. I was brewing a tea. What's going on with
[220.89s -> 231.66s]  my mic here? Come on. Get up here. My mic stand is fucked up. What the fuck? I brewed a tea
[232.30s -> 238.92s]  and the tea bags, I had black tea and a green tea. They were right next to each other and I didn't
[238.92s -> 243.80s]  know which one was which. I wanted black tea and I was just kind of rushing to get things started.
[246.28s -> 249.40s]  I didn't know which one was the black tea. I kind of switched them around too much,
[249.40s -> 254.04s]  so I just put them both in and didn't even care and just brewed it. I don't know if that's a
[254.04s -> 263.06s]  problem. Is it mixing black and green tea like a bad thing? I wasn't gonna wait like the two or
[263.06s -> 270.66s]  three minutes to ruin the water because if I put the green one in... Oh shit, it's the green one.
[270.66s -> 274.42s]  I wanted black tea. No, I don't want the green tea. I would have to like... Okay, I guess I'm
[274.42s -> 280.18s]  gonna drink green tea or what? You redo it, you re-boil the water and... No. So I just put them
[280.18s -> 285.34s]  both in and it's like a weird mix of black and green. I don't know, mixing like different tea
[285.34s -> 292.86s]  drugs. What? We don't have to... I didn't even tweet this. What the... That's the whole point.
[292.86s -> 301.30s]  I went and got my phone. All right, what should I... What should I title this? How about just
[301.30s -> 317.99s]  Pikmin 2 is fucking fun as hell. Pikmin 2. Let's go guys. No, I'm not doing that. This tea tastes
[317.99s -> 324.66s]  bad but I don't even care. I want it. I knew this was gonna happen too. This is gonna cause
[324.66s -> 327.94s]  some frustrations for me. I knew it. I'm hunching over because my mic is fucked. Hold on.
[330.41s -> 335.29s]  And also I'm like stalling right now because I'm terrified that I'm gonna get like twitch...
[335.29s -> 340.49s]  The server's gonna fuck up again. So pardon my paranoia right now while I wait to make sure
[340.49s -> 348.28s]  this is gonna be green for an extended period. It's too teasy. All right, I'm gonna mute because...
[355.90s -> 363.16s]  Okay, are you ready? Are we ready for Pikmin 2? I have not... I've only played like maybe an hour
[363.16s -> 375.70s]  of all this one entire series. So I don't know if it's any good or not. I need to adjust this.
[378.68s -> 394.34s]  Pikmin 2. That... Wow. That really is like kind of 1080, isn't it? That is 1080. Kind of. I mean,
[394.34s -> 405.34s]  I'll fix it. It's 7-1. It's 7-something. I'm probably gonna make somebody sick by doing this
[405.34s -> 412.81s]  but I want to get this right. Oh, don't go to a black screen. No! Oh, that actually... Yeah,
[412.81s -> 423.78s]  that's perfect. Almost there. Almost got it. Almost got it. Almost got it. Got it. Done. All
[423.78s -> 428.28s]  right. Pikmin 2. I don't care about the cutscene. I don't know anything about Pikmin 1. It's a guy
[428.28s -> 432.68s]  that like pulls flower people out of the ground and throws them and stuff. I don't need that much
[432.68s -> 444.65s]  of an explanation for it. I can't imagine the story is that intricate. Is it? Is the story that big
[444.65s -> 452.68s]  of a deal? Hello, this game is shit. You're about to get attacked and I look... What am I supposed
[452.68s -> 457.00s]  to do? I'm looking from like the rafters of the base. Looking down at you running around
[458.04s -> 462.52s]  with like a pickaxe or something and there's like 200 people with like machine guns around you
[462.52s -> 467.00s]  and you're running around like, let me in! Hey, let me in the base! Pikmin 2 sucks!
[467.00s -> 470.54s]  And I'm just looking down like, dude, I'm sorry. You're dead. There's nothing I can do for you.
[470.54s -> 479.91s]  They're all... You're surrounded. Just like... You're dead. I'm sorry. And then you like throw
[479.91s -> 486.63s]  the pickaxe up at me like I'm the problem. Like, oh, fuck you, buddy! It's like, no, I didn't...
[486.63s -> 492.04s]  You just did that. You pissed off like a thousand people. And by the way, you hit like the middle of
[492.04s -> 496.04s]  the castle. You're not strong enough to throw that high. Now you don't have a pickaxe. Now you
[496.04s -> 503.62s]  fucked. I gotta test this too. He's stalling. I'm just making sure it's green for 10 minutes,
[503.62s -> 517.18s]  please! I'm so paranoid. I'm paranoid. I'm not putting... I'm not putting a face cam on for this.
[517.18s -> 522.86s]  Oh, you're not getting a face cam. All right, I need to test the audio and that is a real
[522.86s -> 535.45s]  thing. That's not a stalling thing. You ready? One, one, two, three, two, let's go. Pick. Good?
[535.45s -> 551.27s]  Sounds pretty good, right? Good? All right, let's go. Pikmin 2. Does this have motion controls?
[551.27s -> 560.97s]  Begin. Great Pikmin 2 save data. Yes. We want to see your face. Uh, no, I'm not doing it. I'm
[560.97s -> 570.68s]  not putting my face cam on. It's not happening. This is a pre-recorded thing. No, it's not. I
[570.68s -> 579.19s]  think we're green though. I'm fine. Uh, new ships log. Sure. Are there upgrades in this game?
[579.19s -> 585.00s]  Alcatate, a freight, is a long-haul deep space shipping company. One day, it's only employee
[585.00s -> 590.74s]  of any merit. Captain Olimar, his entire first game, got hit by an asteroid and crashed into
[590.74s -> 596.63s]  Earth on interstellar vacation. There, he was aided by indigenous creatures, which he called
[596.63s -> 602.55s]  Pikmin. In the end, Captain Olimar escaped. Good. Don't need to play the first game now.
[602.55s -> 609.30s]  But in Olimar's absence, his employer, Hokatate Freight, ran into financial difficulties.
[609.30s -> 627.56s]  It was way too hot. Dead. There's Captain Olimar. And by the way, people that say Olimar,
[629.24s -> 641.37s]  we don't listen to those people. President of Hokatate Freight, local employee Louie.
[642.09s -> 645.94s]  Oh, this is a spoiler. I knew he was in the game because I played Smash Brothers.
[645.94s -> 656.90s]  Olimar, I'm so glad you're safe. Yes, very glad. Quite glad. But, sadly, I have an announcement
[656.90s -> 663.83s]  that is not so glad. Our company is going under. Yes, we're finished. On his first mission, Louie
[663.83s -> 671.26s]  here met a ravenous space bunny. His entire load of golden PikPik brand carrots was eaten.
[675.75s -> 682.17s]  I took out an enormous loan to repay the debt from this loss. I decided to sell assets to repay.
[682.25s -> 735.90s]  I fucking forgot about something. We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good.
[736.94s -> 740.06s]  We're good. I just want to make sure that the water boiler was off.
[743.16s -> 750.46s]  I was like, water boiler. Wait, is that on? Oh, fuck. It's off. We're good. It was off. Making
[750.46s -> 772.41s]  sure. Missed the story. With Captain Olimar, you too will save the galaxy. I mean, restart.
[772.97s -> 778.47s]  Okay, I know that he's probably his cousin or something.
[779.27s -> 801.37s]  It's a little brother. Valley of... Okay. We have to repay the debt together as brothers.
[802.17s -> 807.03s]  Nintendo loves having Super Mario and Super Luigi. I get it.
[807.03s -> 818.62s]  That's a lot uglier than I thought it was going to be.
[824.17s -> 827.61s]  That was close. I have averted a crash landing.
[828.81s -> 837.96s]  Running diagnostics. Alert. Danger. Louis is missing. He must have somehow fallen out of his
[837.96s -> 844.76s]  cockpit. He hates the game already. No, I don't. He is not responding via his communicator.
[845.78s -> 854.57s]  He is either flouting protocol or in danger. Oliver, fuck. You must find Louis before he
[854.57s -> 867.62s]  freezes to death in the cold of this planet. Wait a moment. Look. Look. It's a Bunger Burger and
[867.62s -> 877.29s]  Pikmin. Could these be Pikmin? They look like they're about to be devoured as we speak.
[877.29s -> 883.29s]  You must help them point at the screen and press B to call them with your whistle. Oh, no. It uses
[883.29s -> 894.26s]  the Wii pointer. Oh, God. I already hate it. I already hate the game. Okay. You can also hold
[894.26s -> 903.62s]  B to make the sound of your whistle carry farther. Remember? Nope. All right. Let's see what happens.
[903.62s -> 914.20s]  All right. Where's my... I point. Oh, shit. Okay. This game blows. No, it's stop. We haven't even
[914.20s -> 920.60s]  gotten five minutes in. This is like everyone's favorite game in this channel. Pikmin ran to your
[920.60s -> 927.66s]  side. They seem to remember you, Captain Oliver. How fascinating. Give them instructions and do
[927.66s -> 936.34s]  not delay. Hold A to grab a Pikmin. And I got to lean back to this one. I'm sitting back. Hold on.
[936.34s -> 945.19s]  And point at the screen and release to throw it. Shit. Okay. So hold A, grab Pikmin, then hold...
[945.19s -> 950.74s]  Then point at the screen and release to throw it. Cool. Actually, I might actually like this. We'll
[950.74s -> 962.57s]  see. So hold the Pikmin. Actually, it's actually pretty good. It's not bad. That could be a lot
[962.57s -> 973.56s]  worse. I'm going to need like a wrist helper though. Hold on. Yeah. I'm going to have to rest my
[973.56s -> 983.35s]  wrist and just sit here. Attention, Captain Oliver. I have just reestablished my communications link
[983.35s -> 990.95s]  with Louis. It is fortunate we have managed to confirm his safety. Press minus to communicate
[990.95s -> 1003.82s]  with him. Cool. Do the fucking bingo. Wow. I'm going to do bingo of my own stream. If I look at
[1003.90s -> 1012.52s]  the bingo, when I not want to do those things, you're going to have to update me later. I'm
[1012.52s -> 1017.06s]  quite interested in the details of his condition. I'm not going to look at it. Why would I do that?
[1018.58s -> 1031.72s]  No, don't have any fun. Okay. So let's talk to Louis. Louis. It's Vin Diesel. And introducing
[1031.72s -> 1039.48s]  Vin Diesel as Louis. Louis, allow me to assess your condition. As per our safety protocols,
[1039.48s -> 1046.73s]  are you at all injured? Is that so? And my concerns are eased. Our communication link
[1046.73s -> 1054.90s]  shows you are nearby. Okay, cool. You make your way to our location. Rejoin us. I will navigate
[1054.90s -> 1066.46s]  for you. Press plus sign to contact me and obtain information about the terrain. Louis doesn't have
[1066.46s -> 1075.21s]  any Pikmin. Louis has no Pikmin. So I just run up through the... Oh, okay. Yeah, we are nearby.
[1075.21s -> 1085.22s]  Thank God there's a map in the game. I'm so happy there is. Is it worth one? Looks like Louis died
[1085.22s -> 1097.61s]  on impact. That's how they open with it? That would be horrible. Louis, the odd object before
[1097.61s -> 1112.12s]  you appears to be one of the Onions mentioned in Olimar's report. And this is where you get
[1112.12s -> 1122.34s]  the Pikmin from. This is where they are born. The seed, the onion ejected just sprouted according
[1122.34s -> 1136.57s]  to Olimar's report. It can be plucked with A. No fucking way. Oh, it does the wee moan sounds too.
[1136.65s -> 1148.06s]  Oh, he's so cute. This is a red Pikmin. They have fire damage. Maybe. This must be one of the Pikmin
[1148.06s -> 1156.30s]  creatures from Olimar's report. It is staring at you. You can press down on the d-pad to issue
[1156.30s -> 1163.46s]  objectives to your Pikmin squad and direct their movement. You can disband your squad with C.
[1163.46s -> 1173.14s]  Interesting. What is C? Oh. Olimar's description of the creatures resembling PikPik carrots was
[1173.14s -> 1181.43s]  strikingly accurate. Louis, my sensors have detected drool in the corner of your mouth.
[1181.43s -> 1189.37s]  Are you all right? Well, he just got in like a fucking plane crash. What are you talking about?
[1189.37s -> 1209.58s]  He's probably like really fucked up right now. So now it takes one to get the one coin, right?
[1209.58s -> 1234.46s]  Oh, that's cool. All right, go get that. Go get that. Hey, stupid. Go get that. To throw him,
[1234.46s -> 1248.49s]  why can't he just get it on his own? Oh, it's worth one coin. Is there upgrades in this game?
[1248.49s -> 1254.94s]  Eventually, am I going to be able to upgrade stuff? Because I will like it if there's upgrades.
[1255.02s -> 1265.91s]  So these ones give me more Pikmin. Oh, interesting. The onion ejected more seeds. The pellet from that
[1265.91s -> 1272.10s]  flower must hold nutrients that breed Pikmin. Holy shit, this is cool. Yes, the Pikmin gather
[1272.10s -> 1278.94s]  nutrients, haul them to the onion, and further propagate the species. The onion is a Pikmin
[1278.94s -> 1285.96s]  mothership. Reviewing Olimar's report, it seems repeatedly tapping A lets one rapidly pluck
[1285.96s -> 1299.27s]  Pikmin sprouts. Oh shit, okay. How many can I get? Oh, I just have to do it. Okay, so I have three.
[1300.46s -> 1309.11s]  How do I call them back? Oh, we go. All right, and so that's down B in Smash Brothers. I get it.
[1309.11s -> 1315.16s]  All right, so you go get that one. You go get that one. You go get that one. Problem solved.
[1315.16s -> 1325.27s]  Why am I getting minus two for that? That's just a fact. That's my only experience with Pikmin is
[1325.91s -> 1339.35s]  being Olimar in Smash Brothers. Oh, that's cool. Okay, let's get even more of them. How many can I
[1339.35s -> 1354.04s]  have? What's this one worth? Get it. Olimar is the worst character. Wasn't he pretty high tier for a
[1354.04s -> 1366.74s]  while? This game is legitimately hard. Have fun. Well, this game is legitimately hard. Have fun.
[1366.74s -> 1381.75s]  Do they have a health bar? Okay, so now I've got I've got 11 Pikmin. Where should we go? They're
[1381.75s -> 1387.96s]  kind of slow. There's a Duracell battery. Wait, it's actually a Duracell battery. Is this like
[1387.96s -> 1393.83s]  branding in the game? Perhaps this object is one of the treasures that we are searching for.
[1397.88s -> 1401.80s]  The only reason we found it here is because this is where you crash landed. How fortunate.
[1403.18s -> 1407.10s]  I would like to appraise it, but you must regroup with Olimar first. Can you see him?
[1407.74s -> 1415.03s]  Press Z to move the camera behind you. You can also press left or right to zoom it up or down
[1415.03s -> 1422.49s]  to change angles. Okay, that's good to know. Okay, that's like just a turn camera. Oh, that's very
[1422.49s -> 1429.13s]  important. That's disband the group, right? Oh, I don't want to do that. All right, let's go to
[1429.13s -> 1449.22s]  Olimar. Look, I've got friends too. I throw them over there. Hey, hey, hello. Can I pick this up?
[1449.22s -> 1458.81s]  Wait, like go into the bag? All right, one of you go up there and investigate.
[1461.02s -> 1478.82s]  One out of 15. What? I need more. Wait, can I twitch back to Olimar? Oh, it's a puzzle game.
[1478.82s -> 1498.42s]  Now what? It's gonna be an RTS. We're gonna have Olimar on the right side with 10 blue Pikmin,
[1498.42s -> 1502.18s]  five purples. We're gonna have Louis on the left side going to collect like a gold mine from
[1502.18s -> 1507.72s]  somebody else's base or something with like 10 purples, right? Oh, God, I'm gonna lose my mind
[1507.72s -> 1512.46s]  in this game. You're reunited at last. This has been a troublesome start to our trip.
[1514.25s -> 1518.01s]  But now you must feel assured that your combined wits can get you through anything, correct?
[1519.29s -> 1526.38s]  From now on, use B to form a single group, C to take solo action. And that's to change the leaders.
[1526.38s -> 1537.67s]  Okay, form a single group, C to take solo action. Walk around by yourself, okay? So, okay, let's
[1537.67s -> 1550.10s]  get everybody together, right? We got everybody? Let's take this though. Over here. I want you
[1550.10s -> 1558.73s]  guys to get that. Yeah, all of you. Bring it back to the ship. Let's dissect it. And then some of
[1558.73s -> 1563.88s]  you come over. Wait, what about getting the battery? Oh, this is cool. I need, I'm probably
[1563.88s -> 1569.24s]  gonna need 15 people to get the battery. How many people do you think it takes to get the battery?
[1569.24s -> 1592.12s]  All right, let's go get the battery. Or is it back here? How many? It takes, what's it doing?
[1592.84s -> 1605.37s]  Why can't they get it? Take it out. Oh, this is cool. Okay, dig, dig, dig. And they're gonna
[1605.37s -> 1616.81s]  pull it out. I like this game. I like this game. Oh, I like this game. I like this game. A lot of
[1616.81s -> 1628.57s]  people were potentially, oh, I need 20. I don't have 20. We need another seed. All right, you guys
[1628.57s -> 1647.46s]  come with me. Wait, hold on. We just, it's because we fed the machine a body? Is that enough? That's
[1647.46s -> 1659.78s]  enough? We have to feed the machine bodies to make Pikmin. All right, get in there. Give me that
[1659.78s -> 1668.68s]  battery. It's probably worth like $1,000. It's called recycling, Jeremy. Well, hold on. I need
[1668.68s -> 1672.52s]  it. I need like a, I gotta put like a notebook underneath my arm. In fact, I'm gonna turn this
[1672.52s -> 1681.62s]  way. I'm gonna play sideways. You know, I'm gonna put this on the other monitor. I'm playing sideways
[1681.62s -> 1690.23s]  right now. Easier on my wrist, like rested on my arm bit, on wrist, arm wrist thing. Right now I'm
[1690.23s -> 1697.51s]  sitting kind of sideways looking slightly to the right because my arm wrist thing, my chair, is
[1697.51s -> 1708.63s]  propping up my Wiimote so I can just wicked slowly like slob like move this around. It's taking
[1708.63s -> 1728.95s]  them a long time. Your hand is too shaky. Duracells are heavy. They're doing their best. I like this
[1728.95s -> 1733.42s]  game. All right, I'm probably gonna like the first four or five hours of this game and I'm gonna hate
[1733.42s -> 1748.36s]  the rest of it. I just want to be very clear. 280 bucks. A courage reactor. Oh, that's cool.
[1749.08s -> 1767.11s]  I love the sound it makes. You hear that? That's, I love that noise. Cool. Our first day of
[1767.11s -> 1772.33s]  exploration has yielded our first treasure. We will be done in record time. I took liberty
[1772.33s -> 1778.25s]  of naming it when I appraised it. The name reflects my current thinking. Leave it to me to think up
[1778.25s -> 1785.16s]  catchy names for hit products. It is but one of my many talents. We shall end our first day here
[1785.16s -> 1791.96s]  and report back to our president. His face will surely be joyous. However, to communicate with
[1791.96s -> 1798.90s]  Hokotate, we must fly into low orbit above the planet. We will not return to the surface until
[1798.90s -> 1806.47s]  morning so as to avoid the indigenous nocturnal creatures. That's Minecraft, okay? So you have to
[1806.95s -> 1811.83s]  during the, oh my god, it's Minecraft. It's, at night you have to get out. It's timed. This is
[1811.83s -> 1828.68s]  what you guys are talking about. Where's all the Pikmin? Oh, yes, but minus two. Oh, come on,
[1828.68s -> 1845.24s]  it was one Bunger Burger we could have taken. Days, I thought they said Toeklase. Toedays report.
[1848.98s -> 1855.74s]  There's money involved. You like cash in money and you have like storage of Pikmin's and you view,
[1855.74s -> 1865.83s]  I spend this money. You found your first bit of treasure. Fine work. Our future depends on
[1865.83s -> 1871.06s]  your effort so check your treasure hoard regularly. I'll check it often. Keep up the pace.
[1871.78s -> 1897.50s]  Definitely safe. Oh, here's the song. Treasure hoard. Oh, cool. Zoom in on it. What did the
[1897.50s -> 1903.82s]  journal say? We've recovered our first treasure. Amazingly, the Pikmin remembered how to salvage
[1903.82s -> 1911.43s]  it. Oh, I can't understand their adorable language and I don't know what they're thinking.
[1912.07s -> 1917.51s]  Yet, I am so happy to see them. When I crashed on this planet, the Pikmin helped me locate my
[1917.51s -> 1923.91s]  missing ship's parts. In my darkest hour, the Pikmin were there for me. Now that I'm reunited
[1923.91s -> 1936.20s]  with them, I know everything will be alright. It will, right, Gordon? Oh, this is New Things
[1936.20s -> 1949.96s]  in the Piklopedia. Why are you Professor Oak? I don't know who that is. Let's go to the area.
[1950.92s -> 1959.99s]  Day two. I kind of just sit and listen to this music. Excuse me, what? What are you talking about?
[1959.99s -> 1977.43s]  How what? What's going on? What did you want? Pretending. What happened? Professor Oak. What?
[1977.43s -> 1988.71s]  Somebody said I sounded like Professor Oak. What? What's going on? I'm freaking out right now. What
[1988.71s -> 1998.58s]  are you guys talking about? It's a career ending statement. I don't understand what's going on.
[1998.58s -> 2001.46s]  Somebody said you sound like Professor Oak and I was like, oh, I don't know what that is.
[2002.02s -> 2008.71s]  Professor Oak from Pokemon. I don't know who that is. I have no idea who that is.
[2009.72s -> 2015.72s]  I don't know who Professor Oak is. Guys, there's like 5,000 NPCs in those games. I've never played
[2015.72s -> 2024.60s]  Pokemon. Is that the guy that assesses the Pokemon? I don't know who Professor Oak is.
[2025.40s -> 2033.13s]  I have not consumed even maybe 30 minutes total of Pokemon. And you know, it was probably watching
[2033.13s -> 2040.81s]  the intro of the Pokemon. Gotta catch him. You and me. We'll do it our destiny.
[2040.81s -> 2044.57s]  Like 15 years ago when that meme was out. I don't know. I think I've never seen it. I don't care.
[2049.11s -> 2053.82s]  I thought something was wrong. I was like, oh, I don't know who that is. Like Professor Oak,
[2053.82s -> 2059.58s]  I don't play Pokemon. And I look over at chat and it's like, it's as if I like shit like diarrhea
[2059.58s -> 2064.54s]  in my pants and you heard it. And it was like, what the fuck was that? I heard like diarrhea
[2064.54s -> 2068.31s]  sounds. Like, is he all right? What's happening? Is he sitting in his own shit? What happened?
[2078.07s -> 2090.38s]  I don't know who Professor Oak is. Wait, hold on. Let me, I gotta ask. Is Professor Oak the character
[2091.10s -> 2098.07s]  that has the lab coat on and he has like the spiky white hair and he works in the Pokemon center?
[2101.08s -> 2105.72s]  Yes. All right. Okay. I know who that guy is. I didn't know what his name was.
[2106.60s -> 2111.82s]  And on top of that, I don't know what he sounds like. I just, I've seen like a picture of him.
[2112.22s -> 2117.16s]  Good morning, workers. Ready for another day of toiling the profit of your company?
[2119.02s -> 2127.93s]  The Pikmin seem to still be asleep inside their onion. What lazy creatures. No wonder they lack
[2127.93s -> 2132.65s]  survival skills. Stand beneath the onion and press A to call them. I'm not going to stop doing that.
[2132.65s -> 2145.62s]  I'm sorry. Let's call them up. Everybody. How many do we want? Take out or return Pikmin? Wait,
[2145.62s -> 2153.75s]  I have a finite amount? Not yet. Let's assess the area. How much time do I have? Oh shit. Get that.
[2156.95s -> 2170.02s]  I'm going to take 10. 10. Come on out. Five of you get that. The five, the other five must
[2170.02s -> 2177.26s]  have gone the other way. Oh my God. Wait, just the five. How many are in there? One, two, three,
[2177.26s -> 2187.27s]  four, five. You, how many do I have? Five? Shit. I should have taken 11. Take all of them. If they
[2187.27s -> 2202.01s]  die, they're gone permanently though. No fear. Take them. Okay. Fine. I'm going to get that one.
[2204.55s -> 2214.66s]  How many need to be on here? 35? Do I even have that many? Hurry up. Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[2215.38s -> 2232.26s]  Oh shit. There's something right here too. Get that. Any up here? Oh my God. There's so much
[2232.26s -> 2246.63s]  to explore. There's nothing up here. All right. Pull them out. I need 35. Pick them up. Pull them
[2246.63s -> 2259.14s]  up. So many activities. There really are. Okay. I have to, I got to, I'm going to make you guys
[2259.14s -> 2265.34s]  happy. Or some of you angry. I never gave this game a chance because I didn't know it was like
[2265.34s -> 2272.47s]  this. I thought it was like level one. Go. Level two. Go. I didn't think it was sort of this open
[2272.47s -> 2282.74s]  sort of, you just go collect treasure and coins and stuff. I was unaware of that. Nice. We got it.
[2282.74s -> 2290.65s]  All right. This is definitely going to be like an old toy. Kill. Kill. And then eat his body.
[2290.65s -> 2296.70s]  Somebody die? All right. Get out. Go. Let's go. Oh my God. I love this game. All right. Let's keep
[2296.70s -> 2310.87s]  going. Wait a minute. There's a big guy. Don't wake him up yet. Hold on. What's over here? Is
[2310.87s -> 2324.49s]  that a crush can? 35. Okay. Can we get this without waking him up? All right. Nobody get that.
[2325.13s -> 2333.50s]  You know what? Hold on. Wait. Wait. Separate. Louie, you stay here in case shit hits the fan.
[2334.14s -> 2351.61s]  This is on GameCube. This is on the, technically the Wii U. Oh, fuck. This is the Wii version on
[2351.61s -> 2365.34s]  the Wii U. It's pretty good. When are you going to play Smash Brothers? No, I got completely turned
[2365.34s -> 2370.14s]  off forever from playing Smash Brothers ever, ever again. I already told you what happened.
[2370.94s -> 2377.59s]  I did that. That single player mode was cool for a little while. There's almost too much content
[2377.59s -> 2383.19s]  in there though. It was like 60 hours of content in there and it was kind of overwhelming.
[2383.99s -> 2389.77s]  That was cool though. But I played online two or three matches with italics. We just like,
[2389.77s -> 2393.53s]  yeah, let's get, dude, I'm going to start. I'm going to get good with Simon Belmond. You just
[2393.53s -> 2397.88s]  watch me. I'm going to start. I'm going to get good with him. We played two or three online matches
[2397.88s -> 2403.74s]  together, just hanging out. We got beat so badly three or four times in a row. This is a true
[2403.74s -> 2409.74s]  statement. Neither one of us has ever played the game again. I have not turned it on since that
[2409.74s -> 2416.39s]  happened to us. We just were looking at each other just after like four or five matches of getting,
[2417.19s -> 2423.48s]  let's just say we all had two stock. We couldn't even get anybody on the other team past like
[2423.48s -> 2432.01s]  a hundred percent on their first stock. It was awful. So we never played ever again. It's not
[2432.01s -> 2450.70s]  going to wake them up, is it? Basically, get on there. Kill the big guy first. I don't want
[2450.70s -> 2463.94s]  to lose any Pikmin. Are we doing this? Oh, Olimars are over. Can I fight with Olimar?
[2464.76s -> 2486.68s]  Oh shit, you can punch. All right, I guess we're going to go for it. You ready? Attack! Holy shit,
[2486.68s -> 2499.50s]  we got it. Anybody die? We got him. Oh, nobody else can do it. Okay. Wait, some of you guys get
[2499.50s -> 2516.41s]  the can. Oh, this is perfect tactic. Push it over. Just keep pushing it. I need everybody for this
[2516.41s -> 2533.42s]  one. How many Pikmin am I going to get for this? Don't ever attack the face. Oh, okay. Oh, that's
[2533.42s -> 2538.55s]  what his voice sounds like. What was I doing? I was like, oh, Gordon. All right, so let me get that
[2538.55s -> 2569.94s]  right. What are you doing back here? You too. Stop that. Do not.
[2571.86s -> 2582.36s]  Oh, I see it every time. And it's just every low voice is just Mr. Satan. I know and I'm sorry.
[2585.64s -> 2602.34s]  All right, help. Get over there. Get on it. Oh, fuck. I'm sorry. Is it everybody on it that
[2602.34s -> 2618.17s]  it can be on it? I guess so. What does red mean then? So red is capacity too, right? Number plus
[2618.17s -> 2628.18s]  10 is usually the max. Okay. Red means stop it. Good 450 bucks. All right. So there's still a
[2628.18s -> 2641.21s]  whole day here. Where should I go? This way? Where have I gone? Oh my God. Okay. Um, is there
[2641.21s -> 2657.54s]  anything back here? I could go. Should I go this way? Let's go over here. Break that wall. What wall?
[2658.34s -> 2670.18s]  Break the wall. Hold on. I have anything over here. This is wrong way. Um, I just want to see
[2670.18s -> 2693.98s]  anything over here. Oh, on Wiimote. Hey, motion controls. Fuck you. All right. Go for it. Relax.
[2695.86s -> 2702.12s]  Use a GameCube controller instead. I feel like I'll get used to this. I'm already starting to.
[2702.76s -> 2713.62s]  It was a wall. Let me see. Hold on. These guys are kind of slow. Where was this wall?
[2726.31s -> 2744.18s]  Wall. Do I have enough time to do this? Come on. Hurry up. Oh shit. There's a wall here.
[2744.97s -> 2749.03s]  Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike. Go, go, go. Get on there.
[2751.86s -> 2767.24s]  Take it. Break it down. No, no, no. Wrong button. No, wrong button. It's what is it down? What
[2767.24s -> 2775.42s]  button is it? Okay. That's I don't like that. I'll tell you a reason why. Okay. So the Wiimote,
[2775.98s -> 2783.83s]  the Wiimote's controller is not for buttons. It's just, if you press down on the Wiimote,
[2783.83s -> 2795.02s]  sometimes you'll press left or right on the D-pad. I'm not a fan of that. Get it. Can we help?
[2815.58s -> 2816.22s]  Apparently not.
[2832.38s -> 2839.42s]  Are they imagining that somebody else walked in the room that likes Louie and is like,
[2839.42s -> 2842.49s]  oh, what does Louie do? Why are they doing this again?
[2853.94s -> 2866.25s]  It's just recapping. Oh, okay. Wait, don't put them into the geyser. What is this?
[2866.89s -> 2873.72s]  It's for old people and children. Right. Interesting.
[2881.91s -> 2890.84s]  What's in there?
[2895.80s -> 2900.06s]  Well, I'm sorry. We're going to have to do the pebble test here. We're going to do the rock test
[2900.06s -> 2905.02s]  first, Mr. Tin Can, whatever your name is. You grab a rock and you let it go in there
[2905.02s -> 2907.99s]  and you just put your ear over it and you wait until you hear the noise.
[2910.17s -> 2914.41s]  Oh, yeah. Just go ahead and jump on in. Why would I do that? You let the rock go and you put your
[2914.41s -> 2927.93s]  ear over it. So you stand over there and go, drop. We ain't going in that one. I'm sorry.
[2927.93s -> 2944.25s]  I guess we're going in. Wait, I don't have enough time. Do I have time to do this?
[2944.25s -> 2953.14s]  All right, Louie, I need you to come over here. You take some and I'll take some. How many should
[2953.14s -> 2963.85s]  I? I need 50. Stop, stop, stop. Time stops in caves. Oh, how many do I want? I'll go in there with
[2963.85s -> 2977.00s]  50. Take them all. I thought I could only take 50. Wait, what? Oh, okay. I have 59. Okay. Okay.
[2978.74s -> 2992.52s]  I don't know why my brain. I don't know. My brain's insane. Game has been saved.
[2997.54s -> 3004.98s]  Fuck. Did you notice how half-assed that was? I started to think about doing it and then I kind
[3004.98s -> 3010.31s]  of gave up halfway through and I pulled back really hard. Yeah, I gave up halfway through that one.
[3010.31s -> 3017.50s]  I wasn't sure about that one. Intriguing. My heart sensors indicate that this hole has life in it.
[3017.50s -> 3025.91s]  It's warmer than on the surface. Analyzing suggests danger lies ahead, but the promise
[3025.91s -> 3032.55s]  of treasure is tantalizing. If you wish to check underground terrain, press the plus sign to
[3032.55s -> 3040.60s]  communicate with me. I am not just a ship. I am an all-purpose support pod. You have any guns?
[3042.06s -> 3057.70s]  Ooh. All right, split up. I want to take like 25. Olimar, you take this group. Louie,
[3057.70s -> 3063.93s]  you take this group. Here we go. We're going Louie first. Get everybody in the right spot.
[3065.66s -> 3069.66s]  Oh shit. I just zoomed out into the fog of war that I could see and I see that Red
[3070.46s -> 3074.86s]  is desperately trying to group up his enemies 30 feet away from my base and he doesn't think I can
[3074.86s -> 3097.26s]  fucking see him do that. What's that? Take it. Whatever it is. All right. Why am I splitting up?
[3097.26s -> 3106.04s]  Why do we need to split up? Everybody come with me. Are we going to fight? Are we fighting? Are
[3106.04s -> 3121.40s]  they hostile? Get them. Get them. 550. Nice. Seven up. I love seven up. It's way better than sprite.
[3122.94s -> 3129.26s]  Fight. Fight. Oh my God. This fucking Wii mode is going to drive me insane.
[3132.86s -> 3135.50s]  I'm telling you pressing down on the Wii mode. It was the worst idea ever.
[3136.38s -> 3147.00s]  Kill it. All right. How much does it take to get this fruit thing?
[3148.66s -> 3157.53s]  Take it out. Just throw them. Throw them. It squishes the enemies. Oh.
[3158.81s -> 3165.94s]  How can you possibly consider this beast a treasure? Beasts are incompatible with my
[3166.90s -> 3174.01s]  circuitry. I suppose I will store your finds in my hold. But I do think, I do not think beasts will
[3174.01s -> 3187.19s]  be worth much. Well, what can I turn them into Pikmin? I thought that was the point. All right.
[3187.19s -> 3198.02s]  We're good. What about this thing? We go in this? This hole appears to be quite deep. My sensors
[3198.02s -> 3204.18s]  indicate more treacherous terrain. Oh shit. Louis, do you recall that you can adjust the camera with
[3204.18s -> 3214.65s]  Z and up left and right on that? Yes. Your expression suggested you are. You do. Yes, I do.
[3214.65s -> 3219.37s]  Don't worry. All your Pikmin will follow you. Approach the hole and press A to enter it.
[3219.37s -> 3228.52s]  I don't know. I only have like five. Can't do this today. I need to put this orange in.
[3229.16s -> 3234.81s]  Wait, you want me to go down there and just have everybody get killed? That doesn't sound like a
[3234.81s -> 3254.81s]  fun time. Oh wait, maybe I should. How much is an orange worth? 180. Citrus lump. What did I call
[3254.81s -> 3262.84s]  it? Fruit thing? Oh, wait a minute. We still have, I only, one person died. That's it. I'm going for
[3262.84s -> 3288.36s]  it. Time is stopped here, right? What's going? Four died. They did? Send a letter. This goes even
[3288.36s -> 3305.21s]  deeper. Oh, I had 59. Final floor. Oh shit. Okay. This is the, this is important. This is very
[3305.21s -> 3316.26s]  important. Get the camera in the right place. All right. Everybody come with me. Kill it.
[3316.98s -> 3333.94s]  But all right. Yeah. Now pick it up. Deliver that. Oh, a globe. It's inconceivable that such an
[3333.94s -> 3340.18s]  immense object has been buried here for so long. The design on the outer shell resembles the surface
[3340.18s -> 3347.03s]  of the planet as seen from space. Perhaps this can be used for something other than salvage.
[3348.07s -> 3354.22s]  Is it a map? How will we ever lift it? I fear that even a hundred red Pikmin will be unable to lift
[3354.22s -> 3371.14s]  it. What? What? What do you mean? We can't get it? No, we have to be able to get that. Come on.
[3372.23s -> 3377.43s]  Okay. Well, it's like, it's like a Metroid game. I'm going to come back here with the forklift and
[3377.43s -> 3389.35s]  lift it up. Oh fuck. Kill him. How am I not landing on him? You know what to do. Get it. Good job,
[3389.35s -> 3404.92s]  guys. Kill. Good. You know what to do. We'll bring the bodies back. Kind of running out of Pikmin
[3404.92s -> 3422.97s]  though. Okay. Get that one too. How many do I have? 23? What is this? This must be, I think this is a
[3422.97s -> 3431.05s]  new Pikmin. Yep. It's going to be a blue Pikmin. Astounding. A flower blooms in a cave deep beneath
[3431.05s -> 3438.68s]  the snowy landscape. Clearly it is warmer down here than above. Look, the Pikmin are restless.
[3439.80s -> 3445.18s]  Purple. Oh. It looks as if they are, they yearn to be tossed into the flower.
[3457.06s -> 3463.45s]  And it makes a purple. And the purples are strong, right? The purples are really powerful. I remember
[3463.45s -> 3468.17s]  that. They didn't fly very far, but they did a ton of damage when they hit somebody in Smash Brothers.
[3468.73s -> 3485.42s]  What should I get? Like 10? I don't want to get rid of all my Pikmin. All of them? What do you mean
[3485.42s -> 3506.86s]  all? What? Do all? What? Why would I want to do that? Amazing. A purple Pikmin. It has hair,
[3506.86s -> 3515.21s]  and it is quite stocky. It seems very heavy and strong. Each flower can only make five. Oh, okay.
[3516.01s -> 3524.04s]  Pull the bar. This Pikmin is an entirely new type of Pikmin. Transforming Pikmin by tossing
[3524.04s -> 3531.03s]  them into flowers. Intriguing. Perhaps there are others. All right. So we're going to get 10 big
[3531.03s -> 3546.55s]  guys. It's a fat Pikmin. Yeah. And they're worth like five red Pikmin, right? How do I do five at
[3546.55s -> 3568.38s]  a time? Throw it faster? Now we can get the globe. Yeah. I think that's it, right? All right. I think
[3568.38s -> 3591.78s]  that's it. Is there a way to? Oh, this is going to be hard. Globe. Let's get it. Go up the geyser.
[3591.86s -> 3607.05s]  Pepe left. Okay. They're so slow. Come on. Get over there. Get it. Get it there. 100. 100.
[3614.22s -> 3624.34s]  What's it going to be worth? All right. I'm going to show this link.
[3625.86s -> 3628.58s]  Links. I'm going to tell you. Let's go over this really quickly.
[3629.94s -> 3636.58s]  Links are going to be completely removed from chat. Permanently. In the very near future.
[3637.62s -> 3642.50s]  And it's going to be replaced. Links are going to go somewhere else that I can pull from that
[3642.50s -> 3647.94s]  is not in the chat. So they're not being removed from the stream. They're being removed from chat.
[3648.74s -> 3652.98s]  It will be a nice solution where you can post a link somewhere and it can be looked at and then
[3652.98s -> 3662.15s]  I can get a hold of it. It's just not going to be in chat anymore. Oh, keep that in mind. That's it.
[3662.15s -> 3670.09s]  200 bucks. Let me just show this on stream real quick because I found it to be a little humorous.
[3670.73s -> 3694.62s]  This game is humorous. Don't use Discord. I'm not going to use Discord. It's going to be its own
[3694.62s -> 3699.66s]  potential custom solution. We'll find out. I'm going to do a little research.
[3701.42s -> 3705.35s]  This is device resembling a microchip embedded inside the sphere retrieving the data.
[3707.26s -> 3711.82s]  I could only decode a portion of the data but I did retrieve new geographic charts. Oh, new location.
[3713.66s -> 3726.34s]  Ooh. Put them in somebody else's chat. Oh my god. Can you imagine how dog shit that would be?
[3730.79s -> 3736.39s]  That would be the most unbelievably awful way to do that. Put it in somebody else's chat.
[3737.58s -> 3743.43s]  I just make a new account. It's Twitch.tv. I'm not going to say it because I'm too late.
[3743.99s -> 3756.41s]  I don't care. It's just a chat full of links. That is not the solution, by the way. But how
[3756.41s -> 3770.71s]  fucked up would that be? That's so stupid. Okay. Exploration kit. Oh, that's so awful.
[3772.98s -> 3776.34s]  Now that we have this new data, you should explore the decoded territory tomorrow.
[3778.76s -> 3786.58s]  That's total keel. K-E-W-L. Keel. Is everybody here? We didn't leave anybody behind, right?
[3787.22s -> 3793.70s]  I think we're good. Let's go. Oh, that's not a portal.
[3806.49s -> 3829.10s]  I can't wait to see the guitar version of that song. How did you lie about Mr. Slime? I didn't
[3829.10s -> 3835.46s]  lie about Mr. Slime. It was just a lot of things I had to do. Didn't we already go over this?
[3837.86s -> 3841.22s]  Thinking of something fun to do or an idea that might be fun to do is not
[3841.22s -> 3848.70s]  me telling you that it's going to happen in three days. You know what would be awesome?
[3849.34s -> 3855.26s]  I wish Cheetos would make a hot version, but have it be a Chipotle hot version.
[3855.90s -> 3861.78s]  That's a good idea. And a year later, they don't make that. You can't be mad at me for
[3861.78s -> 3866.98s]  coming up with an idea. Why don't those Cheetos exist, Jeremy? You thought about that. That
[3866.98s -> 3876.92s]  would have been delicious. I fucking hate you. I guess I would be the CEO of the Cheetos company,
[3876.92s -> 3882.02s]  right? In that case. But even still, if the CEO of the Cheetos company is like,
[3882.10s -> 3888.54s]  hey, you know what would be really delicious? If we had a Cool Ranch Cheeto, that's a good
[3888.54s -> 3891.82s]  idea. You should do it. Now, maybe. I don't know. We got other things from the pipeline.
[3892.70s -> 3899.06s]  Fuck you. But wait, try our new flavor. We got like five flavors coming out in the next couple of
[3899.06s -> 3922.10s]  months. Try one of those. Not as good. When are you going to put cat ears on, CEO? Let's go. Back to
[3922.10s -> 3936.15s]  the service. Cry, cry. One voice Andy. Hey, you know what? I'll be five voice Andy, okay?
[3936.95s -> 3943.67s]  I'm going to tell you right now. I'm going to stand up for myself a little bit here. I might be
[3943.67s -> 3949.51s]  five voice Andy, but would you rather me be like 30 voice Andy and 25 voices are terrible? Or would
[3949.51s -> 3956.12s]  you rather have completely calculated, clean, cool, five perfect voices that can be used in
[3956.12s -> 3961.24s]  a million scenarios? You want like 30 or 40 crappy voices that you're like, oh, that wasn't
[3961.24s -> 3967.16s]  that good. Or would you rather have completely refined five to six complete voice work?
[3983.91s -> 3993.06s]  Your five voices suck. I want you to record yourself doing this and I want you to send it
[3993.06s -> 4006.09s]  to me tomorrow. I want you to record yourself doing that and send it to me tomorrow.
[4019.14s -> 4025.94s]  Like, don't ask for that, the challenge. That's not a challenge. I just was talking to one person.
[4026.82s -> 4040.74s]  Challenge accepted. No, I didn't. Don't do that, by the way. That takes years of training. That's
[4040.74s -> 4048.02s]  hard to do and it can hurt you. That low, gravelly, deep into the chest voice, that took me 30 fucking
[4048.02s -> 4054.90s]  years to get that right. Be careful. I'm not issuing any challenges here. No challenges.
[4059.21s -> 4073.74s]  It's difficult to do that work. I've missed all this dialogue. Fuck. 30 years.
[4075.08s -> 4078.52s]  Olimar and Louis, since you will explore a new area tomorrow, today's work is done.
[4083.67s -> 4088.39s]  Do that. Also not a challenge, by the way. No, when I said you, I was referring to like the collective
[4088.39s -> 4093.27s]  and when I meant do that, I meant like do it as in like existentially, like nobody can do that.
[4093.27s -> 4098.07s]  I can do that, right? That's what I meant by that. Like you as in collectively you and do that as in
[4098.07s -> 4102.55s]  like I bet you couldn't. Like because I'm like collectively speaking like in existential terms.
[4110.33s -> 4119.16s]  There's a backtrack? No. Okay. When I say you guys, right, I'm not referring to like one single
[4119.16s -> 4126.49s]  person sitting in their room. Otherwise, I would say, hey, Dave Anderson, watching the stream right
[4126.49s -> 4133.88s]  now, I hope you had a really good birthday last week. And that's that I'm directly addressing one
[4133.88s -> 4156.55s]  of you. It's always Dave. Why can't it be somebody else? No, don't do anything. I'm kidding around.
[4156.55s -> 4168.94s]  It's a joke. What's so special about Dave? I don't know. The easiest name to remember.
[4169.74s -> 4175.02s]  You guys want a little bit of insight into my brain. It's very, very difficult for me to come
[4175.02s -> 4188.36s]  up with first and last real names. If I sit here and try to come up with a name, Mike, Dave, John,
[4189.24s -> 4195.16s]  Smith, Anderson, Stevenson. I don't, it's hard to come up with like a full name.
[4202.58s -> 4207.14s]  Jeremy, but that's my name. That's not me making up another name. That's me just using my name.
[4208.55s -> 4222.60s]  Just say Andy. Just say Andy. But here's the thing. We don't come up with names for people
[4222.60s -> 4228.50s]  anymore. We come up with the thing that they didn't and then add Andy to it. It used to be
[4228.50s -> 4233.90s]  you'd put that shit in quotes. Like it was like, Oh God, Jimmy, the schnoz.
[4236.47s -> 4248.01s]  Acapella or something, right? Now it's just schnoz Andy. We don't come up with like full names
[4248.01s -> 4253.82s]  anymore. We just give them the kind of a description and then add Andy to it. It's kind of ruined my
[4253.82s -> 4271.48s]  way to process people's names. Schnoz Andy. But you know what I mean though? Like Twitch, it started
[4271.48s -> 4278.04s]  to like get into my brain. Even in emotes and stuff. Like I don't even, I'm 35 guys. I'm older.
[4278.04s -> 4286.25s]  I'm an older gentleman and for no reason I'll randomly just think of, Oh, that was so cool.
[4287.61s -> 4292.25s]  I don't even talk like that though. I don't even talk like that. It's just in the head.
[4292.97s -> 4304.89s]  I have never said that out loud, but internally I say that. Not like Monka S. I internalize that.
[4304.89s -> 4312.18s]  If something's scary, I'm like, Oh shit, like Monka S. Like fuck. Language is sort of changing.
[4314.36s -> 4319.40s]  You can, emotes are becoming, you can like communicate with emotes now.
[4319.40s -> 4327.42s]  They used to do this stuff back in like the hieroglyphics days. Hieroglyphics are coming back.
[4328.06s -> 4333.67s]  We're having a midlife crisis? Yeah. Yes, absolutely. This is absolutely what that is.
[4334.39s -> 4352.31s]  So yeah. Oh, I want to look at these. The purple pitman were somehow able to carry this. Now I'm
[4352.31s -> 4356.95s]  to get into my head because I have five voice Andy. No, excuse me. Sorry. I'm going to rephrase
[4356.95s -> 4366.63s]  that. Jeremy, goofy voice, Albertson. There. I'm not doing, I'm not doing that anymore.
[4367.51s -> 4375.66s]  The purple pitman were somehow able to carry this massive treasure. Today we measured their
[4375.66s -> 4381.77s]  physical strength using a ship's onboard beef abator. It seems that we have 10 times the weight
[4381.77s -> 4387.45s]  and physical power of any pitman. When I throw them, they land with a resounding
[4387.45s -> 4396.09s]  foot. I've decided to commemorate the cave first encountered them by naming it an emergency cave.
[4396.09s -> 4414.78s]  Mr. Potter. I can't even read this shit. We're going to go back. Kylo Ren auto. Oh, give me a break.
[4415.98s -> 4428.26s]  Awakening woods. Let's go. What the fuck is this game? Wait, hold on. Are you whoing
[4428.26s -> 4433.06s]  Pikmin? That's not possible. Is it? When did the last Pikmin come out? Pikmin three, Pikmin four.
[4443.05s -> 4448.26s]  Morning. How are you? It should be pleased you to know that the purple Pikmin are lodged safely in
[4448.26s -> 4456.58s]  my home. Confines of my interior seem to suit them perfectly. Well, they do occasionally tickle me.
[4457.70s -> 4463.61s]  That wasn't Bernie. That was supposed to be Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[4463.61s -> 4486.36s]  I think I've got to focus. I have to focus. Good morning. How are you? Fuck. That is Bernie.
[4487.62s -> 4495.67s]  Good morning. How are you? How are you? How are you? Good morning. Good morning. Fuck. It is. No,
[4495.67s -> 4500.01s]  but it's not though. It's kind of not. Stand in the ring of light below and press A to call the
[4500.01s -> 4522.18s]  purple Pikmin out. Okay, let's get the purples. I want 30 red Pikmin and then Louis, I want you to
[4522.18s -> 4535.88s]  get purple Pikmin. I want five pur- all? I don't want to take all. All? What? What if they die?
[4543.69s -> 4555.69s]  Jeremy Elbertson Andy. Louis has Olimar instructed you on the particularities of the Pikmin
[4555.69s -> 4564.01s]  creatures. The Pikmin form groups based on color when disbanded with C. Grabbing Pikmin with A
[4564.01s -> 4570.89s]  will also cause them to group by color. Now for the bonus lesson. First, press and hold A to pick
[4570.89s -> 4577.18s]  up a Pikmin. Then, while you hold A, press B to swap between different colored Pikmin.
[4579.00s -> 4584.20s]  This is the first time you have heard this, Olimar. Remember to properly train new employees.
[4584.60s -> 4605.64s]  All right, that's cool. Yeah, you guys are gonna be at work. There's gonna be a new employee
[4605.64s -> 4612.44s]  at your job and the name's gonna be like Greg Michaels and that you're never gonna call them
[4612.44s -> 4626.15s]  Greg Michaels. You're always gonna call them new employee Andy. Language is changing. All right,
[4626.15s -> 4632.97s]  let's throw some- let's get these and then let's crush these guys with some big ones.
[4635.48s -> 4649.30s]  Oh, what's that? Whatever it is. Kill it. Kill it! Just kill everything and pick it up.
[4651.26s -> 4660.14s]  Nice. Okay, I'm gonna get that. Oh, there's a big one over here. We'll get- we'll group up
[4660.14s -> 4686.20s]  after this. Go. Very cool. Cool. All right, there's more. What's the actual cap? Is it 100? It's 200.
[4686.20s -> 4702.33s]  Holy shit. We could handle that? No, no, no, no. 100 in a party. Okay. All right, let's do it.
[4704.63s -> 4714.95s]  Um, wait. Somebody get that. Anything else? Zoom up. Oh, nice. Get these too. I love this game.
[4714.95s -> 4727.98s]  It's really fun. Fight! Ah, get them. Yes. Cool. All right, now get these too. Somebody pick up
[4727.98s -> 4742.76s]  those. All right, and then the rest of you. Anything up here? Wait, let's kill the big guy
[4742.76s -> 4751.62s]  first. There's a strawberry up there. Hell yeah. All right, we're all gonna- we're just gonna rush
[4752.26s -> 4760.10s]  into his back. Let's rush into his back. All of you at the same time, all run into his back.
[4760.74s -> 4782.02s]  Get him! We died. All right, bring it. Good job, everybody.
[4790.47s -> 4797.96s]  Grow for crits. Oh, okay. Grow purples at the back. Okay. Thanks for the tip. You're wasting time.
[4797.96s -> 4807.77s]  I am? Wait, what's over here? What is, like, hiccuped? What is over here? What's this? Honey?
[4807.77s -> 4814.33s]  Oh, they've ranked up.
[4861.37s -> 4866.17s]  Didn't you note that no more than 100 Pikmin will venture into the planet at once?
[4866.17s -> 4872.15s]  But I currently observe only 95 on the surface. Could there be wild Pikmin somewhere?
[4874.62s -> 4881.64s]  Oh my god. Everybody settle down. Settle down. I promise we'll get ice cream after the field trip
[4881.64s -> 4903.24s]  is over. Pick them all up. I want ice cream now. Well, you can't have it now. Sorry. All right,
[4903.24s -> 4908.17s]  let's keep going. I have so many Pikmin. All right, where do we go? Get the strawberry.
[4909.43s -> 4916.86s]  All right, one big guy. Get strawberry. That should be enough, right? How many do I need?
[4917.50s -> 4928.01s]  Then another one. No, no. Stupid. Wait. Oh, okay. I guess I have to switch it every time.
[4928.65s -> 4937.46s]  I'm just gonna fit on there. More. We want more speed. Go. Get it over there. All right,
[4937.46s -> 4946.10s]  the rest of you follow me. I can't go up here. Where can we go? This way.
[4946.34s -> 4977.22s]  Oh, what's this? This fight? What's going on here? Oh, they're picking the fruit. All right.
[4977.22s -> 4995.80s]  I'm splitting you guys up. Go this way. 1,100 bucks. Name Sunsea Berry. They are yellow.
[4997.77s -> 5010.10s]  Okay. 10% of debt recovered. Oh, nice. Just like me. I believe I've also recovered 10% of my debt.
[5012.23s -> 5018.33s]  All right. Oh, they got little berries. Oh, berries. Jerry, they got berries.
[5019.21s -> 5040.78s]  Somebody pick one up. Pick up the berries. What kind of berry is this? This red berry contains
[5040.78s -> 5046.17s]  an ultra spicy essence. It does not appear to have any monetary value, but I should research
[5046.17s -> 5052.62s]  it for use. Cool. Bring me another one. Okay. Well, I'll bring you like 10 more. I got like 10 on the
[5052.62s -> 5067.69s]  way. I forgot about that word. We can keep getting them. Oh, they just kind of respawn. All
[5067.69s -> 5074.09s]  right. I don't know what that does, but whatever. 85. Where's the other guys? Missing people? All
[5074.09s -> 5083.74s]  right. Into the gate. You're wasting time. I'm just... Look, this is not going to be an efficient
[5083.74s -> 5091.48s]  playthrough. Captain Olimar, my research on the red berries that you discovered has yielded a
[5091.48s -> 5098.63s]  powerful potion. Behold the ultra spicy spray. Although it is untested, I believe it will have
[5098.63s -> 5107.74s]  spectacular results. Spray it on all of your Pikmin by pressing two. When necessary, I can
[5107.74s -> 5114.79s]  produce one bottle of spray from 10 berries. Press that button to contact me and confirm your berry
[5114.79s -> 5129.26s]  count by pressing left. Should I just do that now? Okay. What is that thing? Get him. Get him.
[5132.12s -> 5143.43s]  Weigh him down. He dropped an egg. All right. I want big guys. Everyone over here,
[5143.43s -> 5157.32s]  drink that. Drink up that stuff. Can I make a different... I want the purple guy to drink.
[5163.00s -> 5166.04s]  I guess you can't really do that, can you? I could split him up. Oh, well, I did it.
[5166.68s -> 5176.14s]  Now they got it. They got it. All right. Should I get more berries? Separate button. All right.
[5176.14s -> 5203.05s]  Shit. Okay. Right. I'm going to get some more berries. Four. Three guys on berry duty.
[5203.85s -> 5215.46s]  I need 10, right? I hate that so much. I'm now... I'm seriously just pressing down on the D-pad.
[5217.16s -> 5222.12s]  This fucking cheap Wiimote controller. They just... They couldn't make it four buttons.
[5222.12s -> 5225.72s]  They had to make it one giant button. How dare they? How much did this console fucking sell?
[5225.72s -> 5236.01s]  Like 50 million copies? Fucking failure. 100 million consoles sold or something like that?
[5236.01s -> 5253.46s]  Absolute failure. Come back here. That should be enough, right? Give me one more group. How
[5253.46s -> 5264.76s]  many Wii consoles actually have been sold? It was like 50 or 60... 100 million something,
[5264.76s -> 5269.88s]  right? What was it? No, not 50, 60, 100 million. That would be... There's not that many people on
[5269.88s -> 5287.45s]  earth. 101 million. Oh my God. All right. The rest of you just go over here. 101 million?
[5293.56s -> 5303.40s]  There are way more people on earth. Whatever. I'm going to split these guys up. All right. You go...
[5304.58s -> 5316.28s]  You stay over here. You go get the guys that delivered the berries. Bring it back. There are
[5316.28s -> 5333.38s]  more Wiis than people. You know... I wouldn't be surprised if there were more iPhones than
[5333.38s -> 5339.99s]  people that exist right now. And I'm talking all the way through every generation. I wouldn't be
[5339.99s -> 5352.57s]  surprised if in the next few years it was that. Come on, get in there. Find a spot.
[5353.29s -> 5365.18s]  Something's going down. Hurry up. There's an insane amount of e-waste in the world, unfortunately.
[5365.18s -> 5371.10s]  Oh yeah. Whatever that is. Back up. Back up. Back up. Back up. Run away. Run. Run. Oh my God.
[5371.10s -> 5385.37s]  Don't eat him. He ate him. All right. I don't know how to fight that guy. No. I'm trying to hit B.
[5386.17s -> 5390.41s]  I'm trying to hold B. You have to hold somebody and then hold B. B calls people back.
[5391.05s -> 5401.64s]  Nintendo. Nintendo. That was a mistake. B calls people back. I have to hold A and press B to
[5401.72s -> 5423.22s]  switch Pikmin. Nintendo. This was a mistake. What's left? Holy shit. Kill it. Kill it.
[5424.95s -> 5438.86s]  Kill it. Oh my God. We're good. We're good. We're good. This is a dangerous world.
[5439.58s -> 5441.86s]  It's not an electric thing. I can't. I don't want to go there.
[5444.82s -> 5456.28s]  All right. It's almost sundown. How much time do I have? The sun will be setting soon. Call all the
[5456.28s -> 5463.90s]  Pikmin to you. This planet's native nocturnal life forms are ferocious and therefore dangerous.
[5465.82s -> 5470.46s]  Load your Pikmin into the onion and yourself into my hole so we can take refuge in low orbit.
[5471.42s -> 5476.52s]  Pikmin in your squad will enter the onion on their own at a day's end, so call them all to you.
[5477.90s -> 5490.36s]  Oh shit. We gotta go. What the fuck? There's like a gold coin up there. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.
[5490.36s -> 5499.96s]  Hurry. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry. Everybody in. Quick. Get it in. Get it in. Get
[5499.96s -> 5506.02s]  it in. Get it in. Get it in. Get it in. Get it in. Get it in. Get it in. Get it in. We're missing
[5506.02s -> 5517.85s]  somebody. We're missing somebody. Who are we missing? Doesn't matter. No, it's over. Yeah, go.
[5521.18s -> 5531.14s]  Take out over. No. What? How do I leave? How do I get out of here?
[5531.14s -> 5537.02s]  First field trip. Check the map. What do you mean go back? I have five seconds.
[5537.02s -> 5541.05s]  You have time. As long as they're in my squad, it doesn't matter, right?
[5541.77s -> 5553.50s]  Shit, they're up there. Yes, that doesn't matter as long as they're in the squad.
[5553.50s -> 5574.81s]  Okay. I don't think I have time to do this. Straight ahead. Come on. Where are you? Where are
[5574.81s -> 5601.42s]  you? I found him. We did it. We're so concerned about Pikmin. Louie's just like picking his nose
[5601.42s -> 5609.61s]  200 yards away. The alligator just monster comes up from under the ground with mouth open and
[5609.61s -> 5623.62s]  closes it around him, crushing him. I got a bunch of stuff. I got a bunch of fruits.
[5626.42s -> 5642.98s]  Best gamer moment. No, that was a general gamer moment. Who died? No. Eight have died in battle
[5643.96s -> 5655.88s]  so far. Best gamer moment. How's progress, Olimar? Remember, you'll never get anything done if you
[5655.88s -> 5661.48s]  sit back and watch from afar. Press left or right on the D-pad for a close-up view of the action.
[5662.20s -> 5682.60s]  Move my body over here. Okay. All right. So, above ground, there's still things to do on this one.
[5682.60s -> 5693.80s]  Maybe I'll go back to that one. This is a new thing. Let me see. Honey wisp.
[5694.92s -> 5698.28s]  It's floating left from just effortlessly on the winds. Upon death, its physical structure
[5698.28s -> 5705.78s]  instantly collapses. If we could simply recover a live sample researched on the spaceship,
[5706.50s -> 5715.80s]  I would have to take it alive? How do we do that? It's a scary piranha plant thing.
[5717.13s -> 5725.98s]  It has eyes in it. Just be careful. Watch out for eyes. Flowers that have eyeballs in them.
[5725.98s -> 5746.04s]  Be careful. Press A. Wait, what? What the hell is going on here? Why am I throwing carrots?
[5754.73s -> 5778.57s]  I just gave them food for like four years. I don't know. What am I supposed to do?
[5779.45s -> 5789.94s]  Okay. I don't think that does anything. Wait, I can feed carrots to this thing.
[5799.46s -> 5810.94s]  Oh, it's eating the carrots. Whoa. It didn't like that. It doesn't like carrots?
[5811.58s -> 5826.38s]  This thing is terrifying. This is like Pan's Labyrinth. I don't like this guy. What about
[5826.38s -> 5846.54s]  these guys? Do you guys like carrots? Okay. What about you? You guys like carrots?
[5849.40s -> 5868.57s]  That's cool. It's like a little petting zoo. All right. Let's keep going. Do I want to go?
[5869.29s -> 5875.72s]  I want to go back here. There's still stuff I didn't do here. What was it? Let's find out.
[5877.32s -> 5893.06s]  No. What? I'll go back. Okay. All right. This time I'm going to go. I saw there was a gold coin
[5893.06s -> 5908.65s]  over here that I want. Give me a gold coin. I want 90, 80, and then as many of the purples
[5908.65s -> 5923.02s]  as I can get. Actually make it 95, right? Yeah. All right. Let's do it. Don't waste any daylight.
[5923.58s -> 5927.86s]  Forget about that stuff. I don't need it right now. I want to go over here because there's a
[5927.86s -> 5931.99s]  gold coin over here. There's also this bridge. Can they go in the water?
[5935.61s -> 5950.49s]  They die if they go in water. Let's test it. Yes, they do. Okay. Come on. You're good. Okay.
[5950.49s -> 5958.65s]  I can throw them over there though. Golden butterflies. Get one. Get one of those.
[5962.31s -> 5968.47s]  Bring them back. Bring them back to the base. Nice. All right. Come back. Come back. Come back.
[5968.47s -> 5983.53s]  Back. Back. Come back. Come back. Come back. All right. There's a bunch of nectar over here.
[5984.09s -> 5998.98s]  All right. They're good. How many died? Wait. No. You didn't collect them?
[5999.78s -> 6015.29s]  All right. I'm good. I've got 93. Who cares? They die if they go in water. All right. Well,
[6015.29s -> 6023.26s]  let's go this way. Where can I even go? Down this way? I'm going to go this way.
[6023.26s -> 6039.29s]  Over here. Whoa. There's something munching on those. Get it. Whatever it is. Climb up there
[6039.29s -> 6055.13s]  and get them. Get them. Get those little caterpillar guys. Get them. Get up there.
[6064.26s -> 6075.51s]  Good. Good. Good. Good. Drop them. Drop them on the ground. Nice. All right. Bring it back to the
[6075.51s -> 6092.50s]  base. Excuse me. Bring it back. Is it still alive? What's fighting him? Is that a bad thing?
[6098.71s -> 6136.34s]  There it is. Okay. 200. I don't think I have enough. 180? No, I don't. Press two. I wonder
[6136.34s -> 6145.32s]  how... Where do they walk this? No, I can't. Two? Press two. Two. Two. What does two do?
[6146.55s -> 6154.55s]  Cave to the left. Yeah. Let's go this way. It adds weight. Hold on. I'm going to go this way first.
[6159.06s -> 6167.91s]  Another globe. Why does it look poisonous? Come back. Come back. Come back. Come back.
[6167.91s -> 6181.98s]  Is it poisonous? Emergency. Pikmin are suffering. If you blow your whistle with B,
[6181.98s -> 6195.21s]  you may be able to help them. Okay. So I can't touch that. Your Pikmin are suffering, Jeremy.
[6195.93s -> 6205.88s]  There's a cave over here. Yes.
[6210.04s -> 6213.00s]  Biological sensors are reacting violently. The readings are ominous.
[6215.14s -> 6219.70s]  Beast of unknown power lurks in these depths. A large Pikmin group would be reassuring.
[6221.22s -> 6225.30s]  My sound sensors are picking up hostile roars of many beasts.
[6225.30s -> 6232.58s]  Expect dangerous encounters. Extreme heat pockets. You may need flame-resistant Pikmin.
[6232.58s -> 6237.37s]  But my records indicate no such data. Are my records incomplete?
[6238.90s -> 6248.79s]  I have to assume reds are fire-resistant. Should I leave the purples? I feel like I don't want
[6248.79s -> 6260.17s]  to bring purples down here. All right. Louis. Louis, you stay here with the purples. Take them
[6260.17s -> 6282.50s]  all? I'm scared to bring everybody. Always take them all? Jeremy, you're wicked funny. Thanks,
[6282.50s -> 6295.78s]  dude. This is how we're going to do this. I saw a good chat message. Louis is going to be in charge
[6295.78s -> 6301.98s]  of purple and Olimar is going to be in charge of red. So where are we going first? We've got
[6301.98s -> 6315.19s]  a few directions to go. How about this way? Get over here, Louis. Use the purples to fight.
[6315.19s -> 6335.69s]  Get them. Yeah, they do like a big ground stomp. All right. Pull these guys back.
[6337.10s -> 6343.58s]  Louis, good job, Louis. Wait, we got a... Oh, what's this? What's this artifact? What's this
[6343.58s -> 6351.86s]  over here? Oh, it's a single button D-pad? Oh, wow. Yeah. They used to use these fucking shitty
[6351.86s -> 6366.23s]  things. Back like 5,000 years ago. Yeah, definitely collect that. This dark soul is that
[6366.23s -> 6373.16s]  fucking guy. Yeah, they used to put all four buttons on this rotating weird axis thing.
[6374.50s -> 6377.62s]  Yeah, it was really, really interesting. I'm saying, yeah, we don't do that anymore.
[6385.05s -> 6387.69s]  Didn't they used to think that you had four humors in your body?
[6388.87s -> 6399.40s]  Yeah, I think that was the same time period. All right, let's get going.
[6402.42s -> 6412.04s]  Fire this way. One of you take that for research. One of you take that for research. Did you not
[6412.04s -> 6427.35s]  listen to me? Over here, Louis. I love the purples. It's so unique. It's so cool. They
[6427.35s -> 6445.75s]  have that unique ability. Anything down here? There's nothing over here, huh? All right, hurry
[6445.75s -> 6452.68s]  up. In the meantime, while they do that, you... That's the... Go to the next level. Did I miss
[6452.68s -> 6465.90s]  something? I feel like I missed a thing to grab. I just want to check. No, there's nothing in here.
[6465.90s -> 6472.86s]  Wait. Yeah, I got it all. Okay, I had to. All right, everybody follow me. Good. Nobody died.
[6472.86s -> 6479.19s]  We didn't lose anybody. We got an artifact. Let's go. The noise means you got all the treasures.
[6479.19s -> 6496.17s]  Okay, cool. That's good to know. What noise? Just so I can be aware of it. The power down noise? Okay.
[6496.17s -> 6508.95s]  The whole of beasts. When the Pikmin are singing, it means you have everything. Oh, okay.
[6511.82s -> 6524.89s]  What's that? Let's float it up. An egg? Pick it up. Don't break it. Pick it up. Why did you break it?
[6525.21s -> 6533.86s]  Oh! All right, we need the cleanup crew to... Everyone pick up. Pick one up. Oh, wow.
[6534.74s -> 6550.26s]  Look at all this nectar. Everyone's full. I have all flower Pikmin, I think. Well,
[6550.26s -> 6556.95s]  hold on. Let me just double check. Holy shit, I got a whole crew of full flowers.
[6557.75s -> 6574.10s]  Nice. All right. That was over there. Let's go. Is this another egg? Okay, I was expecting spiders.
[6574.10s -> 6589.90s]  Nothing on that side. Is it behind us? All right. Let's go deeper. Oh, purple. Purple, purple,
[6589.90s -> 6620.42s]  purple, purple. Let's do it. Now we can go drink the nectar. Sick. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Those
[6620.42s -> 6635.03s]  of you that didn't drink, come over here and drink. Slurp it up. All right. One of you didn't get it.
[6635.03s -> 6652.76s]  I think there was one more over here. There is. Sing the nectar song. You guys keep... Every time
[6652.76s -> 6659.58s]  we raid somebody now, you guys demand a song from them. Let me just give you some streamer
[6659.58s -> 6666.95s]  insight on this. If I got raided and I was in the middle of doing something... Let's say I was in
[6666.95s -> 6671.43s]  the middle of an important match or something, or something really, really I had to pay attention to,
[6671.43s -> 6675.27s]  and I look over at the chat and it's like, sing the fucking raid song. And I'm just like,
[6676.39s -> 6689.80s]  what are you talking about? Raid song? Too bad, Omega Low. Sing it. And then they have no idea
[6689.80s -> 6695.69s]  what you're talking about. You know, I'm surprised a bunch of you guys don't get banned immediately
[6695.69s -> 6704.14s]  when we raid. Sing the raid song. Fucking no. Ban all these people. It may have. I don't stick
[6704.14s -> 6721.18s]  around for all the raids. That may have already happened. Fire. Here we go. Let's take the fire
[6721.18s -> 6739.32s]  guys through. No, you idiot. Okay. I can just walk through this. Wait, they put it out? Oh,
[6739.32s -> 6770.55s]  they put it out. Oh, this is Floppy disk. Oh, by the way, somebody linked me. I saw on Twitter,
[6770.55s -> 6776.65s]  somebody, I was in the discord talking about attack on Titan. And I said like this show sucks
[6776.65s -> 6788.98s]  and stuff. All right. Let me, I gotta be very clear about this. Listen to me. I have, I have seen,
[6789.78s -> 6797.05s]  I am like a big fan of that show. People were pissed that I didn't, I wrote, what did I write
[6797.05s -> 6804.28s]  exactly? I said, oh yeah, I'm 10 episodes into attack on Titan. Oh, I don't get it. Like this
[6804.28s -> 6810.76s]  show sucks. Why are they Titans? Like stupid as fucking show or something, right? A little
[6810.76s -> 6816.04s]  bit of people know that I've seen every fucking season. I've seen, I'm like a big fan of the show.
[6816.04s -> 6822.78s]  I just was bait. Yeah. And people thought I was really stupid. They're just like, wait,
[6822.78s -> 6839.78s]  he's seen 10 episodes? No, of course he doesn't like it. He's fucking, his brain is too small.
[6839.78s -> 6851.66s]  Anime fans, do you bait? Yeah, it was. Give me this Floppy disk. It was also, some of you guys
[6851.66s -> 6857.64s]  miss out on some random in general chat stuff that I do. A few weeks ago, I was in the general chat.
[6858.28s -> 6863.72s]  It was like maybe three or four o'clock in the morning Pacific. And I wrote a bunch of stuff and
[6863.72s -> 6869.08s]  nobody responded. There was maybe like one person that was there. I just wrote a bunch of shit and
[6869.08s -> 6872.76s]  nobody responded. And I wrote like, what the fuck? No one's talking. Like, what the fuck is this
[6872.76s -> 6882.39s]  bullshit? And nobody said anything. I think like maybe two people did like minutes or hours later
[6882.39s -> 6889.99s]  or something. It was three a.m. I think I got everything, right? Are they singing? So that means
[6889.99s -> 6908.78s]  I did it. That right? I'm good, right? I have to be careful because I just write, I just say and
[6908.78s -> 6914.42s]  write random things that don't mean anything. And sometimes I feel like people might see that and
[6914.42s -> 6929.99s]  out of context might go like, wow, he's sick and fucking asshole. Oh, well, we've got a big
[6929.99s -> 6942.36s]  bunger over there. Wait, check back here. All right. We've got to, we've got to have, we're
[6942.36s -> 6962.04s]  going to split this up. Uh, Olimar, too many. No, no, no, no, too many. No. Yes. Louis, wake up.
[6963.00s -> 6987.74s]  Okay. Now I want Olimar. No, get out of here. I fucking hate this controller. This thing was
[6987.82s -> 6995.61s]  meant to be shook around, not pressed any of these buttons. Very nice. Very nice.
[6996.17s -> 7006.70s]  Oh, there's an egg. Uh, I'm not going to break that yet. Let's go kill the big guy.
[7007.50s -> 7016.87s]  All right. Let's get this set up. I'm doing my RTS setup. Jerma's not a gamer.
[7019.35s -> 7035.69s]  Maybe a little. Three, two, shitty. I got him instantly. Oh, it's a gaming watch. Cool.
[7036.41s -> 7051.59s]  Oh, there's more over there. What's in here? Oh, oh, it's a flower. Nice. All right. Get the,
[7051.59s -> 7060.74s]  I love aces. I love cards. I'm a huge card fan. Put a 10 on there. You know what I mean?
[7061.99s -> 7070.23s]  Drop a, drop a jack on top of that. You know what I'm saying? I'm sorry. All right. I need,
[7070.23s -> 7092.87s]  uh, we got to put some more of these guys in here. Yeah. More purples. The ace of spades
[7095.64s -> 7116.92s]  worth $140. Luck wafer. That's cute. It's very cute. David's spade. Go crack that egg.
[7116.92s -> 7121.16s]  So we can get some nectar. Who has not drank nectar? Which one of you?
[7121.96s -> 7131.56s]  Where's that egg over here? What's that sound? There's an egg. Where's the egg?
[7133.56s -> 7163.40s]  What? Okay. Well, they stole it. Oh, there it is. And all right. Get in there. Who hasn't drank,
[7163.40s -> 7201.21s]  drank it. One person hasn't. Oh, two actually. Nice. Drink it. Very good. We can keep going.
[7211.19s -> 7218.41s]  I demand heal. Oh, no, that, no. I misread what you said. This one's deep.
[7219.21s -> 7224.97s]  You know, actually, I could go for one right now. I'm not even kidding. I might go get one.
[7224.97s -> 7230.73s]  What is it? Final floor. All right. This is important. I think this is the first real test.
[7233.91s -> 7238.87s]  What is that thing? It's a giant cat. Can I take a picture of it and upload it and get data on it?
[7238.87s -> 7247.69s]  That's huge. Oh, boy. I feel like I'm going to do this in two parts here.
[7259.58s -> 7273.37s]  All right. It's time. How do we go about doing this? Spray everybody first. All right. So hit
[7273.37s -> 7287.77s]  two and then I'm going in. Great. Astounding. The heads of the Pikmin are glowing and they seem
[7287.77s -> 7294.52s]  extremely agitated. The ultra spicy spray appears to increase Pikmin speed and attack power. Oh,
[7294.52s -> 7308.94s]  man. Okay. Get that again over here. What? What? Why did? All right. Go, go, go, go, go,
[7308.94s -> 7322.90s]  go, go, go, go. Is it temporary? Get in it. Kill it. Where's the other Pikmin? Oh, my God.
[7322.90s -> 7338.07s]  He's going to roll over everybody. Did he kill everyone? He killed every purple. Come back,
[7338.07s -> 7341.75s]  come back, come back, come back. Oh, my God. I didn't know he did that. He killed every purple.
[7342.71s -> 7353.18s]  Oh, no. No. Get on his head. Come back, come back, come back, pull back.
[7355.58s -> 7369.24s]  What the hell? I feel like shit now. Every purple is dead. How bizarre. This device is emitting
[7369.24s -> 7375.85s]  black light. It must have been ingested by that creature. What an absolutely repulsive life form.
[7376.41s -> 7399.40s]  Did I get soft locked? Reload. Can I? No, I can't. No reload. No. Oh, every single purple is dead.
[7402.92s -> 7415.16s]  Every single one. That's so sad. That's so sad. Why couldn't it have been the red ones?
[7420.10s -> 7427.03s]  I can get them back. Yeah, I know. But it's still sad. I'm glad I have enough to actually lift this.
[7446.25s -> 7456.73s]  200. Just reload the floor. No, I know. I have to live with consequences. I can't be a Dave state
[7456.73s -> 7464.58s]  every single game I play. This contraption seems to react when it approaches treasure.
[7465.69s -> 7476.30s]  I will connect it to my radar. Oh, like beeps. The treasure gauge is now fully operational.
[7477.48s -> 7496.44s]  20 purples died. That sucks. Please restart. No, come on. You need them. Restart.
[7501.13s -> 7514.36s]  No, I'm not restarting. I have to deal with the consequences. Is that it? We wasted three gas.
[7514.36s -> 7532.58s]  Yeah, but I can go get that gas back. That was a lot of money. That's over a thousand dollars.
[7532.58s -> 7561.35s]  38 people died. God, that's unfortunate. Farm more at the caves first. Do some farming. All right,
[7561.35s -> 7573.19s]  I'm getting a heal. Let's take a break. I'm going to go pee. I'll be right back. BRB.
[7810.25s -> 7817.75s]  It's actually kind of funny. Whenever a cat boy image comes up, I get to kind of watch
[7817.75s -> 7829.05s]  the PUBG blue thing start to be right behind some of you guys. All of a sudden it just gets like,
[7829.77s -> 7853.24s]  whoa, whoa, whoa. What's that? Run. The zone, yeah. Just wait till I actually put the costume on.
[7862.66s -> 7866.58s]  You just wait till I turn the camera on one day and I'm in like full cat boy.
[7880.44s -> 7888.65s]  Please don't. Here's the thing about, I think I've said this already, but I'll say it again.
[7888.65s -> 7895.69s]  That stream is going to be the most unfollowed and followed stream I've ever done on Twitch.
[7895.69s -> 7919.05s]  Let's just be clear about that. All right, let's get back. I got my heal. Oh, and it's delicious
[7919.05s -> 7934.47s]  and it's giving me tons of recharging fuel. What heal flavor? I mean, there's three flavors,
[7934.47s -> 7940.50s]  and I'll give you the rundown. There's a chocolate, there's a berry, and there's vanilla.
[7940.50s -> 7948.28s]  The chocolate one, I think tastes the best, but I think it's a little too thick. It's very
[7948.28s -> 7954.36s]  milkshaky. It tastes good, but I'm not a big fan of that. The vanilla tastes very good,
[7954.36s -> 7959.24s]  but I don't like the texture. It has a weird texture to it. It has a texture that I'm not
[7959.24s -> 7966.09s]  like a fan of, and I don't know why I can just tell. The berry though, it's smooth. It's got a
[7966.09s -> 7971.53s]  good flavor. It tastes kind of like a strawberry yogurt drink, and I would say that's my favorite
[7971.53s -> 7977.75s]  one. There's no soy in it. The person that just said that timed them out for a minute. This is a
[7977.75s -> 7993.56s]  non-soy product. Anyways, let's play Pikmin. All right, what are we doing? Oh yeah, a bunch of
[7993.56s -> 8004.10s]  purple Pikmin died. Hold on. Heal's in the way of this Wii sensor. There we go. All right, so let's
[8004.10s -> 8019.46s]  pull up these... So I need purples. I can't believe I have no purples. All right, where do I want to
[8019.46s -> 8028.55s]  go? The treasure meter is blinking. Let's go this way. I need water Pikmin. That's definitely what
[8028.55s -> 8034.66s]  that is. We can't go that way. Oh, berries. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's do some berry farming.
[8035.22s -> 8047.45s]  Berry farming it is. Guys, there's no fucking way that the dev is in the chat. No, no, that is
[8047.45s -> 8072.74s]  impossible. You're right. Who even made this game? I know it was Nintendo, but what studio? Of course.
[8074.42s -> 8085.69s]  Was it just like a... What first party or whatever Nintendo studio? This is a Miyamoto game. Is it
[8085.69s -> 8109.34s]  really? Wait, Miyamoto made this? What? Yes. Is there anything that he can't do? Is there anything
[8109.58s -> 8119.45s]  that that man couldn't do? Honestly, if you told me like, oh yeah, Miyamoto like flew overhead with
[8119.45s -> 8124.17s]  like a Superman cape on and he can shoot lasers out of his eyes, I'd be like, yeah, I'm sure he...
[8124.17s -> 8134.71s]  That would not surprise me. I'd be like, oh yeah, that makes sense. I want that. Sacrifice somebody.
[8134.71s -> 8144.82s]  I want to see what it costs. Never mind. There is a gate up here. There's an electricity gate.
[8145.62s -> 8156.02s]  I can't get that. I can't even get up there. I have to get rid of this thing. This is 200. Shit.
[8156.66s -> 8167.46s]  What can I even do here? This has got poison gas on it. What's the play? I have to go farm
[8167.46s -> 8192.38s]  purples in the cave. Do I have to do this like three or four times? You should have reset.
[8192.38s -> 8196.54s]  But I mean, I can't just... Look, we can't rely on everything to just restart a game save.
[8198.17s -> 8205.19s]  God damn it. I'm actually going to try heal because of you. Well, don't be angry about it.
[8205.19s -> 8214.33s]  Don't be upset about it. Don't be mad about it. You don't have to do anything.
[8215.13s -> 8232.17s]  But I didn't like... I'm not making you do that. It's the next level, right? I don't even want
[8232.17s -> 8242.42s]  these things. Let's go. Mega-lul, it's working. Fuck you. I'm doing it. Influencer Andy,
[8243.32s -> 8251.35s]  you're abusing your reach to malnourish children. I'm going to tell... I mean,
[8252.23s -> 8258.28s]  let me tell you something. That person that just said that, you must have not done any research
[8258.28s -> 8267.75s]  on the product at all. It's 400 calories, 20 grams of protein, no soy. I'll read it again. I
[8267.75s -> 8271.51s]  don't even care. No one's paying me to do this. I don't care. These things help me a lot. I swear
[8271.51s -> 8293.27s]  to God. That's a true story. Let me get this. All right, here we go. I'm just going to keep
[8293.27s -> 8304.15s]  doing this and reload. No, I'm going to give you the real, real honest to God reason why I got
[8304.15s -> 8308.73s]  these in the first place. And you can be your own judge. How's that? Those of you who know,
[8309.21s -> 8317.03s]  like a year ago, I was having a lot of pain. And I still kind of am, but I'm still working on it.
[8317.83s -> 8330.10s]  Anyways, I lost like 25 pounds. I was like 133 pounds like a year ago. I don't know if it's
[8330.10s -> 8338.50s]  combination of stress or annoyance or part of me. I don't know. I thought my diet was okay.
[8340.20s -> 8342.92s]  That was also part of the reason why we kind of talked about with the doctor. Like, hey,
[8343.80s -> 8347.99s]  am I losing weight? What the fuck's wrong with me? So I decided I looked at a few different
[8347.99s -> 8354.47s]  companies. I was like, uh, maybe I could like supplement this and like help with like,
[8354.47s -> 8357.83s]  maybe trying to maintain some weight or put a little bit of weight on whatever.
[8360.82s -> 8368.44s]  And I got these. And this is, for me, this is, I'm not replacing food. This is like,
[8368.44s -> 8375.16s]  I'm just adding some of this. You know what I'm saying? Wait, is that more? So I didn't get these
[8375.16s -> 8379.16s]  to like, oh, I'm only going to drink this like fucking product. And that's the only food I'll
[8379.16s -> 8385.99s]  eat. I would drink one like in the morning and maybe drink one at night. I am 152 pounds now.
[8386.55s -> 8393.59s]  I gained a lot of weight. I feel a little healthier. I got a little better. You know what
[8393.59s -> 8401.50s]  I'm saying? Now I do look, I'm not going to tell you that I'm going to attribute it all to
[8401.50s -> 8410.14s]  doing that to dry. You know what, guys? I drank Huel and weirdly enough, I was like 10 times
[8410.14s -> 8417.86s]  stronger. I became a fucking superhero. No, but it absolutely did help me in my particular case
[8418.90s -> 8423.88s]  of trying to put on some weight when I like was having trouble. So there you go.
[8424.68s -> 8432.41s]  There's the true story. And even though I'm still, I don't want to get any heavier than
[8433.05s -> 8442.36s]  like 152, 155 is kind of where I started to draw the line there, but I like them.
[8442.36s -> 8449.26s]  It's nice. And I don't drink them every day anymore. Maybe like during a stream. That's
[8449.26s -> 8454.62s]  a really good like stream snack too, because it's just right there. I can just sip on it.
[8454.62s -> 8466.84s]  It's really good. So I just kept it. I kept it going. Pump iron on. All right. Can I leave?
[8468.57s -> 8475.91s]  Can I get out of here? Give up an escape? Can I just leave and then come back in?
[8475.91s -> 8485.51s]  Or is this going to be bad? That was a Ted talk. There's another purple. Oh,
[8485.51s -> 8500.87s]  there is another purple flower. That's right. Where is it? Does it taste good? Yes. Otherwise,
[8500.87s -> 8508.04s]  I wouldn't drink it. I mean, I am very picky with what I eat. I'm serious. That's why I just told
[8508.04s -> 8514.14s]  you like that. The chocolate one is probably taste the best, but it's too thick for me to
[8514.14s -> 8519.48s]  drink it. It's a little too thick. It's the thickest of the three of them. The berry one
[8519.48s -> 8528.23s]  is probably the lightest. If you if that's what you want, you're like, you know what,
[8528.23s -> 8531.88s]  I don't care if it's a little thicker. I want the chocolate and you'll like it.
[8531.88s -> 8538.70s]  I think that's that's probably the one that tastes the best flower.
[8543.90s -> 8556.87s]  One more floor down. You buy it in stores and online. I actually don't know. I think it's mainly
[8556.95s -> 8561.99s]  online. I think that you might be able to get it in some stores. I don't really know.
[8565.00s -> 8567.96s]  Nobody said that. Why would I read that out loud if nobody said that?
[8572.60s -> 8579.51s]  Does it just appear in your fridge? I have everybody, right?
[8582.50s -> 8593.66s]  Yeah, you can order it online. You got to go to your Heal dealer. What is it a car?
[8605.50s -> 8618.52s]  The infinite Heal fridge and a Heal branded fridge. No, I can't. I'm not doing that.
[8621.67s -> 8629.74s]  Rank it. This should after I get another 10 or so, that should be good, right?
[8636.86s -> 8649.42s]  What is that flower? Where is it? I know it's in here. I don't have to wake him up.
[8652.28s -> 8659.26s]  Nobody make any noise. Oh, God. Fight him. Fight him. Fight him. Fight him. Fight him. Fight him.
[8660.06s -> 8688.74s]  We're good. All right. I think we got enough. That should be what? 10, 15.
[8688.74s -> 8696.89s]  You will flower. Actually, no, no, no, nobody did. Don't do this yet. I got to clear this out.
[8697.61s -> 8704.95s]  I don't know. Do you hear what I said? I said stop doing that. I'm trying to just,
[8704.95s -> 8722.81s]  I don't want to have them walk through this and get burned. OK, thank you. Remember,
[8722.81s -> 8726.65s]  you ever thought about how mirrors are some insane alien sci-fi technology and we just,
[8726.65s -> 8735.77s]  and yet we just have them and everyone acts like they're normal? What? You know,
[8736.65s -> 8745.43s]  it's funny you say that and not cellular data technology. It's the mirror. We're worried about
[8745.43s -> 8764.02s]  mirrors and not about like how a Wi-Fi signal travels. That's pretty ridiculous. The fact that
[8764.02s -> 8770.12s]  information can travel through the air, I think is way more alien technology. Like,
[8770.12s -> 8785.29s]  holy shit, bro, than a mirror. But mirrors, mirrors are really kind of weird, too, though.
[8789.96s -> 8795.34s]  But I guess the way you can describe a mirror, I mean, it's just it's just really shiny. It's
[8795.34s -> 8800.78s]  shiny to the point that you can see a reflection in the shininess. So it's not that really that
[8800.78s -> 8818.82s]  weird. It's just it's so it's too shiny. It's reflecting. It's very reflective. It reflects
[8818.82s -> 8827.67s]  too much. By the way, you want to know something that'll freak you out? This is something a lot
[8827.67s -> 8832.23s]  of people don't understand. And this is, I'm going to really turn a lot of you guys' world upside down
[8832.23s -> 8837.61s]  with this one. So when you look in a mirror, you're not actually looking at what you actually look
[8837.61s -> 8843.35s]  like. You ever put up a cell phone to your face and you go, why do I look so fucking weird?
[8844.15s -> 8851.32s]  It's because you are flipped. When you are looking into a mirror, you're flipped. And if you have
[8851.32s -> 8858.36s]  even a slightly asymmetrical face at all, if you don't look in a mirror, you think that you look
[8858.36s -> 8888.92s]  crazy. You guys ever do that? I'm not ugly. No, I don't want to fight this thing again.
[8889.72s -> 8898.44s]  I need to go back. How do I get out of here? That was, that was, it was, that was like watch
[8898.44s -> 8904.28s]  mojo type of like information. Mirrors, what's going on there? Did you know that your cell phone
[8904.28s -> 8913.19s]  reflects you sideways and flips you around? Insane. Ridiculous. Top 10 things that people
[8913.19s -> 8919.03s]  might not have known about objects in their house. Mirror. Mirrors reflect light sideways and flips
[8919.03s -> 8925.27s]  you around. Whatever. I don't care. And look, you want, okay, fine. Watch mojo has like 600
[8925.27s -> 8933.94s]  million subscribers. So somebody's fucking listening to that and somebody cares. So what I
[8933.94s -> 8939.06s]  said was information that was cool. And it was like, well, who'd have thought info run past him.
[8939.06s -> 8955.75s]  Oh, okay. It's you. Oh yeah. How about this one? Oh, you intellectuals. If you take a mirror,
[8955.75s -> 8964.71s]  a small one, and you hold it up on your chin. So the mirror is flat going forward from your chin.
[8965.51s -> 8969.99s]  If you put your chin down and hold it flat against your chin and look down and walk around your
[8969.99s -> 8974.39s]  house, you're walking on the fucking ceiling. It's so cool. Just be careful. You don't trip
[8974.39s -> 9006.90s]  over anything in real life. I think he's sick. Attack on Titans. All right. I got my Pikmin.
[9006.90s -> 9019.74s]  I had to get some more. That is really fun to do though. If you, by the way, all you guys make
[9019.74s -> 9023.42s]  it fun of me for saying, they'll put the mirror up to the tip of your chin and look down and lay
[9023.42s -> 9030.86s]  it flat and walk. I got that from Nickelodeon magazine in like 1993. So, and that shit was
[9030.86s -> 9041.70s]  awesome. So don't come after me. Wait, what's over here? What's over here? Something over here.
[9044.31s -> 9051.43s]  What is this? Is it flowers? There's a treasure over here. Where is it?
[9051.99s -> 9073.82s]  Get this guy. Kill him. All right. We got it. There's something still over here.
[9074.38s -> 9083.59s]  I'm so confused. What is over here? Is it? Oh, it's these. All right. I'm going to go back to the,
[9083.59s -> 9102.15s]  can I weigh that thing down yet or no? It was a beetle up there. It was a beetle. Beetle. I saw
[9102.15s -> 9114.06s]  it too. It's buried treasure. You need another Pikmin. Oh, all right. Let's just keep going.
[9114.06s -> 9129.78s]  What do I need to weigh that down? If I use the spray, will it make them weigh heavier? I don't
[9129.78s -> 9148.30s]  have it. I definitely don't have enough. I need more. I need more purples. What do I need? I need,
[9149.10s -> 9170.02s]  I need a lot more. Spray them? Is that going to do it? No, I need eight more. Fuck. I need a bunch
[9170.02s -> 9183.90s]  of purples. So there's nothing. I have to go back and get more purple. I left people behind.
[9183.90s -> 9197.50s]  I heard a hule fart. Why are they over here? Oh my God. There's so many over here. Why were they
[9197.50s -> 9217.98s]  stuck? Didn't deny. All right. Give me a bunch of people. Let's see if we can do it.
[9224.23s -> 9227.75s]  I can't. It's hard to play right now. You guys just fucking me up so much.
[9238.18s -> 9269.69s]  Don't fight it. Just go. Is this enough? Hurry up. Oh shit. Whatever. Knock it down. Hurry up.
[9273.38s -> 9289.00s]  Get on there. Shit. I got it. All right. We're good. We're good. We're good.
[9290.31s -> 9294.73s]  I'm okay. Everything's fine. I got everybody, right? All right. We're coming back here tomorrow.
[9295.29s -> 9306.25s]  And I'm going that way. All right. Good thing I got them.
[9325.08s -> 9330.76s]  Click this link. I was getting farts. I've had a hule and I've been farting. Foul,
[9330.76s -> 9354.73s]  sulfuric rotten eggs. It lingers. Well, I can't. This did not. This is not happening to me.
[9355.53s -> 9369.94s]  You guys understand. I can't. You guys, people eat apples and they get diarrhea and shit. You
[9369.94s -> 9376.63s]  know what I mean? That's so hard to tell. There are a bunch of people that eat pasta and then
[9376.63s -> 9397.24s]  they fart all day. What do you want me to say? That did not happen to me. People's bodies are so
[9397.24s -> 9402.97s]  different. What makes some person have an upset stomach? Somebody could have a thousand of.
[9404.68s -> 9410.12s]  My dearest dear, how are you? Your boss gave me this space email account and told me all about
[9410.12s -> 9424.76s]  your business trip. Just remember you have a family to think about. Oh, you guys. You guys.
[9424.76s -> 9432.07s]  I don't even know what to do with you. Okay. I'm going back there and I'm going to go in that thing.
[9451.75s -> 9472.55s]  Okay. Let's pull everybody up. Is German making less sense than normal?
[9472.55s -> 9478.55s]  No, I'm trying to respond to people. What? I'm getting linked an image of somebody talking
[9478.55s -> 9484.71s]  about how the lava sulfuric acid farts. How am I supposed to react to this?
[9489.90s -> 9511.50s]  This is a very abnormal thing to react to. All right, everyone go. All right. Here we are.
[9512.06s -> 9522.33s]  Let's get everyone out here. We're good. Come on. Let's go. Hurry up. Me. All right. Now we're
[9522.33s -> 9536.23s]  going to. Here we go. Let's get this started here. Okay. Eat him. I don't care. We're good.
[9536.87s -> 9543.74s]  Somebody died. Yeah. One red died. That's okay. There's the gas again. I can't. Oh, I can go down
[9543.74s -> 9581.48s]  here. Wait. I'm going to go. I'm going to follow them. I want everybody to come down. You know,
[9582.92s -> 9587.24s]  you go around like Twitch and you're like, what's this streamer's chat doing?
[9587.96s -> 9593.30s]  Having a conversation about stuff. Like, oh yeah, let's talk about what's happening in the game. Oh
[9593.30s -> 9598.98s]  yeah. Make sure you get two purples, 15 reds and the blues are coming up soon. I just want to let
[9598.98s -> 9602.90s]  you know. I take a look at that. Hey dude, like what's everybody up to lately? Everyone doing
[9602.90s -> 9609.46s]  something fun. What did you do last weekend? No, no here. Here I look over at the chat and I just
[9609.46s -> 9617.14s]  see in all capitals. He'll farts. He'll fart. Andy farting because of fuel. He's becoming. He's
[9617.14s -> 9621.38s]  farting. I can tell. Put your mic in your ass so we can tell if you're farting or not. I read.
[9621.38s -> 9628.23s]  That's a real one. I read. Put a mic onto your like asshole so we can be sure you're not farting.
[9628.23s -> 9653.27s]  That's what I have to read over here. That's what I have to read. Mythbusters. Mythbusters. What was
[9653.27s -> 9663.56s]  that? Astounding. My metal detectors are reacting violently. What could be down below? No. If you
[9663.56s -> 9685.45s]  find trouble below, press that. Yes. Yes. Yes. What's down here? This is gas and fire. No,
[9685.45s -> 9692.38s]  I said my piece. It really helped me a lot. All jokes aside, it did a lot of good for me.
[9692.38s -> 9715.14s]  It really did. That's the honest to God truth. Oh, this is cool looking. Watch out. All right,
[9715.14s -> 9723.96s]  now pick it up and bring it back to the ship. Consume its blood. How many calories are in one?
[9723.96s -> 9750.26s]  400. 400 calories and you don't. What was that? That's. Oh, somebody brought up. Somebody said
[9750.26s -> 9755.62s]  talking about sugar. It's five grams of sugar in the bottle or in one serving if you get like a
[9755.62s -> 9761.69s]  powder. Only five grams of sugar. Some of you guys are drinking like a fucking Mountain Dew
[9761.69s -> 9782.86s]  right now and it's like 40. So just to let you know, Mountain Dew is 60. What? No, it's not.
[9784.50s -> 9793.54s]  What? Mountain Dew is 63 grams of sugar in a bottle in just a like a 16 ounce bottle. No,
[9793.54s -> 9801.98s]  it's not. I thought it was like 39 or like 43 or something. It's 63 grams of sugar. That's
[9801.98s -> 9820.34s]  unfucking believable. A Coke is what? 38, 37. What? Why is it that much? Okay. Is it my opinion
[9820.34s -> 9823.78s]  that once you cross a certain threshold of sugar in a drink, you can't even tell it's in there
[9823.78s -> 9832.44s]  anymore after like 30 to 40 grams of sugar. Can you even tell that it's 60 instead of 40?
[9834.20s -> 9847.59s]  I can't. It's 46. I have an experiment for all you to do. If you drink coffee and you put,
[9847.59s -> 9851.35s]  you know, milk or cream and sugar in your coffee or something, if you get just a regular from,
[9851.43s -> 9855.11s]  I'm going to use Dunkin' Donuts as an example, right? Or even Starbucks, whatever. Doesn't
[9855.11s -> 9859.91s]  matter. Just getting a normal just with cream and sugar at any of this one of these random
[9859.91s -> 9867.11s]  places that don't that just a big coffee shop. Start doing half sugar. You're like, oh, yeah,
[9867.11s -> 9872.55s]  I'll take a regular iced coffee. But can you do a half distribute put it? I bet you you won't even
[9872.55s -> 9881.11s]  tell the difference from 50% to 100%. I started doing that and I couldn't tell. I actually could
[9881.11s -> 9892.79s]  not tell the difference. And what you're doing is you are reducing the amount of sugar you're
[9892.79s -> 9896.31s]  taking in every day, which let's be honest, it's really not that great for you. It really isn't.
[9898.01s -> 9920.52s]  You know, you can't even tell it's based and healthy. They're ignoring you and putting in
[9920.52s -> 9932.47s]  regular sugar. They're not. It's just, they just didn't even change it. Yeah. Okay. Half sugar.
[9932.47s -> 9939.61s]  Okay. Nope. Not doing that. That's no, that's not true. I've seen people make the coffee.
[9940.63s -> 9948.17s]  Holy shit, that's fire. And instead of going like one, two, three, four, five,
[9948.97s -> 9964.38s]  with like a sugar, it's one, two, done. I've seen them do it. Well, they have the pumps,
[9964.38s -> 9968.38s]  right? That's a lot of places have pumps and they take your coffee over and they go.
[9973.45s -> 9982.63s]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop too much. Way too much. You can specifically ask for like
[9982.63s -> 10006.90s]  one pump or like two pumps. Start doing that. I'm serious. I want fire only. Get in there.
[10009.35s -> 10020.18s]  You can't hurt them. They're fire. A generous 12 pumps. And I have another thing to tell you.
[10020.90s -> 10027.37s]  Oh, he's got more to tell us. Oh, okay. Everybody watch out. That's a diamond over there.
[10029.51s -> 10033.03s]  If you are asking for extra cream and extra sugar in your coffee,
[10033.99s -> 10041.11s]  you're, you're eating a cake. Just, just go eat a cake. Go order a cake at like a bakery and eat
[10041.11s -> 10052.25s]  the cake. You cut back, cut back on that. That's a lot. Extra cream, extra sugar is just a cookie.
[10052.25s -> 10058.92s]  And you're just drinking a cookie. Not worse than that. I wonder what like extra cream,
[10058.92s -> 10061.96s]  extra sugar at like a Starbucks or a Dunkin' Donuts. I wonder what that actually is.
[10062.76s -> 10066.60s]  What is it? Well, how much is, what does, what is the actual, um,
[10067.16s -> 10077.66s]  like milliliters of cream and sugar and stuff? And then how much like cream and sugar goes into
[10077.66s -> 10092.44s]  baking a whole cake? I'm interested to know. Can they get this? I can't get that. Can't get it?
[10093.08s -> 10114.47s]  Is he dead? Can they get it? Sacrificing five, um, breads. Were they walking it? Oh,
[10114.47s -> 10121.59s]  they get, they got it. They got it. They got it. They got it. I love this cream. Have you ever
[10121.59s -> 10137.88s]  wanted a way to drink? That's not even real. Making that up. All right. No more. I got it.
[10138.68s -> 10149.98s]  Is there any more layers? Yes. There's a customer that, my friend works at Starbucks and somebody
[10149.98s -> 10166.39s]  comes in and gets seven shots of espresso and extra sugar. What? That's a lot. Is that person,
[10166.39s -> 10173.61s]  I feel like that's like the joke drink that the Incredible Hulk drinks in one of the last
[10173.61s -> 10185.78s]  movies or something. Eight shots of espresso with extra sugar. And it's tiny in his hand and you're
[10185.78s -> 10204.10s]  like, yeah, it was light. Ooh, different flower. Cool. I get seven shots of espresso.
[10207.80s -> 10214.31s]  One shot of espresso is one coffee, right? So therefore you're essentially drinking seven
[10214.31s -> 10225.32s]  coffees. That's a lot. No, it's less. Is it more? One shot of espresso is two. It's one to two.
[10228.07s -> 10234.57s]  Well, I'm talking about the caffeine count. One shot of espresso is about one to two cups of coffee.
[10234.57s -> 10247.58s]  Two shot is a medium coffee. Like six coffees for seven shots of espresso.
[10251.46s -> 10257.62s]  Did you hear that sound come out of my mouth? It was like the Pikmin look as if they long
[10257.62s -> 10272.09s]  to be tossed into the flower. Well, let's, I don't want to do it to purple. Is white electricity?
[10275.06s -> 10303.50s]  We'll find out. Or water? No. White is poison. Oh, so the gas. Okay, cool. Get in there.
[10303.50s -> 10311.64s]  I'm going to go get some gas.
[10320.92s -> 10328.04s]  Incredible. A white Pikmin. It's tiny, but it looks distinctly swift. Its eyes are an unseemingly red.
[10329.00s -> 10334.31s]  This type of Pikmin was not mentioned in your notes, Olimar. It must be an entirely new type
[10334.31s -> 10340.26s]  of Pikmin. A data record on this type is a blank page since a certain captain never documented them.
[10342.95s -> 10346.95s]  You must experiment and make detailed observations for the benefit of future generations.
[10347.59s -> 10364.66s]  It's omega low Reddit. Kind of is the Reddit Pikmin, isn't it? Oh, why can't I not go in?
[10365.22s -> 10396.62s]  I just put three. It was a waste. No, it wasn't. Louis, get up here and help me pull these.
[10396.62s -> 10416.60s]  Just replants them. Cool. Well, I got 15. Okay, let's get back to the group.
[10418.92s -> 10436.55s]  Something in here. What is in here? What is it now? Perfect. Oh, it's dinging.
[10437.51s -> 10449.42s]  Hey. Amazing. The white Pikmin have unearthed a treasure that was completely buried in the ground.
[10453.90s -> 10456.78s]  Perhaps those beady red eyes of theirs allow them to sense objects buried in the dirt.
[10459.72s -> 10486.33s]  Hooray. How thick is this tape? All right, this is a joke how thick this is. Everybody get on it.
[10486.97s -> 10507.86s]  We'll keep looking. Oh, rank up. No, no, no, no, don't all. Only red Pikmin just rank that.
[10508.42s -> 10525.62s]  You have to share it with everybody else. Share it. Share it with everybody else. What the hell?
[10530.39s -> 10556.25s]  Greedy. Too greedy. $80. Super stick textile. Cool. I like it. That's it for this floor. Let's get
[10556.25s -> 10582.22s]  everybody else. Follow me. We got the whole crew. The whole Drew crew. That's right. That's you guys.
[10583.72s -> 10605.24s]  You are the Drew crew. Was it February? All right. So in June, I don't have to say that anymore.
[10606.38s -> 10626.58s]  Well, here's the gas part. Oh, shit. Everybody split up. Remove the gas. They're fighting. What
[10626.58s -> 10637.66s]  are they fighting? Oh, they're fighting the gas. We'll pick that up. They don't carry that?
[10638.38s -> 10655.85s]  Is the white Pikmin not picking anything up? I can't take this with me for research.
[10656.81s -> 10668.26s]  It's a pipe. I can't like rip it out and take it with me.
[10668.26s -> 10694.78s]  All right. Let's go. Oh, wait. That's why the one behind me doesn't even. Wait,
[10694.78s -> 10706.95s]  can I get the mushroom? Easy. Easy. Don't go that way. I'm going to be safe.
[10707.67s -> 10731.80s]  I can get the mushroom. Cool. And everybody. Yeah, they can get the mushroom. Bring it in.
[10732.52s -> 10748.68s]  This is, hey, Jerome, it's my birthday today. It's Enver. It's my birthday. Could you be
[10748.68s -> 10757.98s]  really rude to me for five minutes? Happy birthday. I'm going to be really rude to you.
[10757.98s -> 10773.45s]  Why would I be rude to you on your birthday? Doesn't sound fun. Treasure. Can I get up there?
[10773.45s -> 10819.38s]  All right. Now walk that way. Get it. Let me get up there. This fucking controller is going to drive
[10819.38s -> 10855.35s]  me insane. I get it. Get it. Careful. Deliver that. Somebody help them. No fall damage. Yeah,
[10855.35s -> 10863.22s]  that's good. You don't need to take all the Pikmin to the entrance of the next geyser.
[10863.22s -> 10866.74s]  They follow you if you enter as a captain, even if they're not in your party. Really? Okay,
[10866.74s -> 10884.06s]  that's good to know. Do a Pikmin impression? Sure. Okay. Which one? Let's see. This is red.
[10884.06s -> 10919.16s]  Let's go. I'm not going to say that, but you know what I was going to say. Catboy practice? No,
[10919.16s -> 10926.31s]  you have no idea. I can't wait to tell you about the Catboy stream. The thing I want to do in the
[10926.31s -> 10935.48s]  Catboy stream. I can't wait to tell you about it like a year from now. Final floor. Let's go.
[10936.04s -> 10949.77s]  Din din din din din din. They should put that in. Din din din din din din. Din din din din din din.
[10959.59s -> 10965.35s]  Run run run run run run run run run run run run run run. It's a fucking bird from Donkey Kong.
[10965.35s -> 10988.25s]  Run. The red liquid you see contains refined ultra spicy essence. One drop contains one dose.
[10990.71s -> 10997.91s]  Press two to spray this extract on your entire group. Have you tried it yet? I have not,
[10997.91s -> 11017.99s]  but I will in just a second. Spray. Spray it. I spray it. Let's go. Pull back, back, back, back,
[11017.99s -> 11021.83s]  back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back.
[11021.83s -> 11034.18s]  Is he going? Attack. On his head, on his head, on his head, you dopes.
[11041.58s -> 11061.53s]  Run under his chin. That's a weak part. Oh no. Where is he? Get on his head. Get on his head.
[11062.41s -> 11072.49s]  What is the sound the Wiimote is making? What's the sound? Why is my Wiimote calling me?
[11080.33s -> 11085.37s]  Well done. Captain Olimar, you've defeated that freakish half bird half serpent hybrid.
[11087.37s -> 11090.94s]  Oh no, don't tell me that treasure was ingested by the beast, wasn't it?
[11098.17s -> 11105.06s]  I think I'm going to turn this off. I'm going to go into the settings and just turn off the Wiimote.
[11105.70s -> 11116.94s]  Being able to make noise. Very cool. All right. Is that everything in here?
[11118.31s -> 11130.17s]  That's the last floor. Go deliver it. Use a game cube controller. I'm on a Wii U.
[11130.81s -> 11150.70s]  I'm not on a Wii. This version doesn't support a gamepad. Okay. Get an adapter, you cheap bastard.
[11152.26s -> 11157.14s]  I just put my arms in the air and went like what? I didn't even know I was going to need it.
[11158.34s -> 11163.30s]  I thought it was like a Wiimote game. If the material looks comfortable,
[11163.30s -> 11177.85s]  I will use it to patch the boss's favorite sleeping bag. Ooh. Seam test. Conclusive.
[11177.85s -> 11187.90s]  Cross stitching successful. The knapsack is complete. Oh, also Pikmin 2 is like incredibly
[11187.90s -> 11192.78s]  fucking hard to find too. It's another one of those games that's like a shitload of money.
[11194.20s -> 11202.31s]  And it might have taken long to get here. I don't know. I did not anticipate a lot of these first
[11202.31s -> 11210.84s]  party old Nintendo games are going to be this hard to actually get a copy of. And I'm not going to
[11210.84s -> 11214.36s]  say this again. All you guys telling me to emulate a first party Nintendo game, you're going to get
[11214.36s -> 11218.92s]  me fucking thrown in jail. They're coming after me if I do. You're trying to get me fucking,
[11218.92s -> 11224.02s]  you're trying to get me taken? A first party Nintendo game? You want me to emulate and be
[11224.02s -> 11229.77s]  like I'm emulating first party Nintendo game. What do I care? Alerts go off at Nintendo headquarters.
[11236.50s -> 11241.38s]  Wait, when you have an unoccupied time interval, press and hold C to take a nap.
[11258.70s -> 11261.90s]  Everyone does it. I don't care if the Queen of England does it.
[11264.62s -> 11306.58s]  You would hold C. I don't want to hold C. I heal as Olimar. That was so cute. All right,
[11306.58s -> 11310.10s]  somebody just wrote, I used to emulate Pokemon at school back in the day, you boomer.
[11315.40s -> 11321.32s]  Did you do it in front of 10,000 people saying, hey, I'm emulating. I didn't buy this.
[11326.36s -> 11342.12s]  I think that's a small difference. Yeah, I did actually. Well, it looks like you got away with
[11342.12s -> 11351.98s]  it. You don't have to say you're emulating it. Oh, people will know. I'll hit like escape and
[11351.98s -> 11355.58s]  somebody will see like the emulator running and all of a sudden that's the running joke for the
[11355.58s -> 11377.45s]  next like three days. You know how I know that? Because it's happened before. If I have to emulate,
[11377.45s -> 11386.87s]  I do. Let me be very clear about that. But if I can play on original hardware, I'd like to play
[11386.87s -> 11394.34s]  on original hardware for a couple of reasons. It's kind of cool to actually own the consoles
[11394.34s -> 11398.42s]  and stuff. It's like sure, could I have like emulated the entire Dreamcast stuff? Yeah,
[11398.42s -> 11402.58s]  but I own the Dreamcast now and I have all that stuff. It's just kind of cool to have.
[11416.78s -> 11420.06s]  Now, that doesn't mean I'm against doing it. I've emulated plenty of games.
[11420.70s -> 11441.80s]  Okay, I can do the gas thing now. Yeah, criminal. Where's the gas down here? Right? Wait,
[11441.80s -> 11450.09s]  I want to harvest this stuff. I'm going to stay here for a minute. Nintendo interest has intensified.
[11453.08s -> 11459.16s]  Look, I just I don't want to fuck around. Nintendo really had a major crackdown on emulating
[11459.16s -> 11482.01s]  and emulated games and roms a year or two ago. I don't. I'm sorry. Nope. You need to
[11482.01s -> 11488.36s]  good lawyer. Instead of having to worry about having a good lawyer, why don't I just play the
[11488.36s -> 11500.10s]  one on Wii? Okay, I could either like hire a lawyer and have like a thousands of dollars
[11500.10s -> 11508.98s]  of a retainer fee or just play the game on Wii U. I think I would rather do the Wii U one.
[11511.80s -> 11535.38s]  How do you like it so far? It's really fun. It's very fun. All right, gas. Get through the gas.
[11536.18s -> 11547.74s]  It was this way. Oh, it's another globe. Cool, cool, cool. Oh, new level. Yes. All right, where
[11547.74s -> 11560.86s]  are they? You're kind of stuck, aren't you? Go get it. This is going to take a very long time,
[11560.86s -> 11581.94s]  isn't it? Use the spray. It's true. I got one person. I didn't get anybody. I didn't hit one
[11581.94s -> 11599.06s]  person with that. Why? You, Louie, you stay here. What else can we do in the meantime?
[11599.86s -> 11610.74s]  I just screamed at him. What can I do in the meantime? I don't think I can do anything in
[11610.74s -> 11632.60s]  the meantime. Please look at a Pikmin idol animation. I'm begging you. Okay. Hold C. No.
[11633.40s -> 11647.16s]  You're fine. You're fine. You're fine. Get over here. You're fine. Okay, I can't do anything.
[11649.11s -> 11673.21s]  Dismiss and then watch. They sit down? Why is that such important? Why do you need to see that so
[11673.21s -> 11685.70s]  bad? Okay. Can Olimar walk in here? We could kill that guy. All right. Let's kill that thing.
[11690.58s -> 11711.24s]  Oh, no, we can't. No. We get it. Yes. All right. Let's get in here. Get the globe.
[11718.12s -> 11739.08s]  Look at the flowers. What are you guys? What have you guys done? No. Nope. Not even going to
[11739.08s -> 11745.96s]  fucking address it. Fascinating. This object is highly similar to the one you found in the
[11745.96s -> 11759.37s]  Valley of Repose. By examining this further, I may be able to extrapolate new planetary data.
[11759.37s -> 11768.28s]  Oh, excuse me. Fight. Good. Blow him up. All right. We're going to have a lot of things to take
[11768.28s -> 11778.36s]  here. We have take his face and take the globe. Get that. Nice. Everybody on it. Bring it here.
[11778.36s -> 11788.98s]  Here we go. Cool. We've got a head. We got that. Where's Louis? Oh, he's right here. Nice. Okay.
[11788.98s -> 11795.34s]  Good. Bring it. There's a log there. There's one more thing over here, isn't there? Oh,
[11795.90s -> 11801.58s]  cannot go over here yet. This is like a Metroid. You have to get the right pick and come back.
[11801.58s -> 11834.42s]  You go back to the old levels and a Metroidvania. I'm sorry. I will apologize for that one. I'm
[11834.42s -> 11854.71s]  sorry. That one deserves an apology. You know how to do it. I'm a bird. You know what to do.
[11854.71s -> 11857.91s]  You just have to, you just have to call to me and I will call you. I will do it.
[11858.47s -> 11870.86s]  All it took was somebody to write just that doi doi doi in chat and I just did it.
[11879.30s -> 11885.91s]  Please do the scrumptious cake. I've said that so many times. Just go back to one of the times
[11885.91s -> 11916.44s]  I said it. Do Megalovania doi doi doi please. I don't think I can do that. I don't think that's
[11916.44s -> 11947.80s]  possible. It's too hard to do. Am I just the weird guy at the lunch table? Hey, hey, hey, dude. Hey,
[11947.80s -> 11953.48s]  hey, watch this. Hey, hey, dude, do the doi doi doi, but this time do this song. Okay. Sure thing.
[11956.76s -> 11959.72s]  He did it. He actually did it. He's going to get, he's going to get detention now.
[11962.04s -> 11966.84s]  Jeremy, what? You think it's funny to make noises in the middle of the lunchroom?
[11968.50s -> 11971.86s]  Yeah, I'm just having fun. That's two more days of detention.
[11972.58s -> 11978.71s]  I'm reliving what happened when I was in fucking high school. That's actually what happened.
[11979.35s -> 12001.64s]  Okay. Hey, dude, hey, do doi doi doi again. Like turn, do it like right into the air and then
[12001.64s -> 12004.92s]  make an elephant noise after. No, I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do an elephant noise at
[12004.92s -> 12008.28s]  the end. Yeah, dude, come on, do it. It'll be funny. I'm not going to do it. All right.
[12011.00s -> 12027.43s]  This actually was real. Same shit happens on every stream. All right. I got to go back.
[12033.80s -> 12042.46s]  Everybody go home. Let's go home. Do doi doi doi. It'll be wicked funny. Don't go to sleep.
[12045.10s -> 12074.07s]  Oh, dude, do doi doi doi. It'll be wicked funny. Pause the ends day early. Oh, okay.
[12074.79s -> 12098.41s]  Pikmin top left. What? Chairman, it's my birthday today.
[12100.47s -> 12104.26s]  Oh, it would have been if you didn't throw me into the water two hours ago. By the way,
[12104.26s -> 12124.71s]  I am red Pikmin number 94. Oh, sorry about that. That was a lot of money today. 810 bucks.
[12125.35s -> 12137.45s]  That's pretty good. Who died? I've only lost Pikmin to battle. Nothing else.
[12138.17s -> 12146.84s]  Hold on. Good work so far. I hereby promote you to perennial manager. Press C to divide up work
[12147.93s -> 12163.02s]  and to delegate more to your subordinate leader. New level unlocked. Where is it?
[12168.34s -> 12195.22s]  New treasure. Very cool. I want to see the tape up close. Oh, that's good. What do you say for his
[12195.22s -> 12201.78s]  wife? The vivid color of this red stone reminds me of my wife's eyes when they burn with rage.
[12202.58s -> 12207.86s]  Just between you and me, I've noticed lately that she's been getting more wrinkles. Now that I
[12207.86s -> 12213.56s]  think about it, I've probably caused her a lot of stress. When I return to Hakau Tate,
[12213.56s -> 12220.06s]  I'll take her on a long vacation. I thought this was like a piece of shit or something.
[12220.70s -> 12228.79s]  Well, it is, but I thought it was an actual like shit. This is shoe polish. There are several
[12228.79s -> 12233.59s]  different patterns drawn on this object's surface. They appear to be characters or letters. I can't
[12233.59s -> 12236.79s]  make any sense of them. This is just an educated guess, but I wonder if this object is kind of an
[12236.79s -> 12247.45s]  alien bulletin board. The size of the object seems about right for it. Oh, that's cool. What's this
[12247.45s -> 12255.43s]  one? Today, I delivered an impromptu lecture on the basics of wilderness survival. As Louis
[12255.43s -> 12260.98s]  Superior, it's my responsibility to teach him these skills. Walking around as much as we do
[12260.98s -> 12266.02s]  generates an intense thirst, so water becomes very important. I told Louis that we have to ration our
[12266.02s -> 12270.98s]  water carefully. That's what I was thinking until I found this. I so parched that I couldn't help
[12270.98s -> 12278.01s]  myself. I drank all the water in the canteen. It tasted so good. When I turned around, Louis gave
[12278.01s -> 12295.85s]  me a cold stare. Let's go to area select. Okay, well, I have new... I'm gonna go back to the first zone.
[12295.85s -> 12306.63s]  I think I could probably dig something up, maybe? I'm gonna go for a zone. No, I need water first.
[12306.63s -> 12329.51s]  I guarantee to get water pickling here. John Oliver. How many zones are in the game? Four. Cool. So
[12329.51s -> 12338.58s]  you're just supposed to go all around and go back and forth and stuff. The two types are sleeping
[12338.58s -> 12343.38s]  well and do not quarrel. I have made them most comfortable. That's good. You can call out the
[12343.38s -> 12355.14s]  white Pikmin by standing in the light beneath me. Yes, yes, yes. Give it a burp. Well, there you go.
[12355.14s -> 12362.95s]  To retire early for the day, press start and then press right on the d-pad. All right, so what we
[12362.95s -> 12377.46s]  need? I'm gonna assess the area. Oh, yellow. Wild Pikmin, can you see them? Captain Olimar.
[12379.51s -> 12382.79s]  They're yellow Pikmin. You encountered them when you crashed on this planet, correct?
[12383.51s -> 12387.77s]  It would be most helpful if they remember you like the red ones did. Yes, most helpful.
[12396.84s -> 12407.38s]  Where are they? There's a frog guy over here. There's a cave right there. All right, let's
[12407.38s -> 12423.35s]  just take the crew. They're like a competing franchise. What's that? Oh, no, that's yellow.
[12423.35s -> 12436.62s]  Okay. All right, I'm gonna take some. I'm gonna take a crew. All right, I'm gonna take 50 red
[12442.42s -> 12455.35s]  and then all of these and all the purples. What does that leave me with? I can still get a few
[12455.35s -> 12479.00s]  more. Okay. Well, let's first kill this thing because why let it live and we can dissect it
[12479.00s -> 12493.40s]  and research it. You can kill anybody, right? Who died? A red Pikmin died. That's okay.
[12500.90s -> 12508.04s]  Wait, where do I bring this? I gotta put that in the yellow one. Where's the yellow? All right,
[12508.04s -> 12534.71s]  let's just follow them. Am I putting this yellow one in the red one? Whistle them. Put the lime
[12534.71s -> 12544.58s]  in the coconut. You put the yellow in the red, it explodes. Well, okay. I know that's not real.
[12549.13s -> 12568.55s]  I think I'm supposed to put that in the other one. Follow me. Sing it. Big subs.
[12582.42s -> 12587.83s]  Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight. Why is he going in there by himself?
[12591.80s -> 12595.24s]  I could hear how bad that singing sounded so I stopped immediately. Sometimes I can do pretty
[12595.24s -> 12613.43s]  well. This hole is filled with wretched nasty bugs. Are we fighting or what? All right, take those
[12613.43s -> 12630.60s]  bugs. There's a flying one right there. Crush his head. I'll take him. What's back here? I
[12630.60s -> 12640.94s]  can't go in the water. I can't go in the water. I can go in there. Hold on. Go over this way for a
[12640.94s -> 12683.78s]  sec. Be careful. Can we get up here? What does that mean? 201. Okay, now we're going to go
[12686.39s -> 12695.29s]  do the balance this. Is that what this wants me to do? It doesn't want me to go up on top of this.
[12695.93s -> 12714.01s]  Why is it lagging so much? It's an elevator. What's the point of this though? I don't know.
[12714.01s -> 12727.05s]  Why do I need to use this? What's it for? I just don't get it. If one of them is... We can go up
[12727.05s -> 12737.02s]  and then... Oh, wait. I can't get there from over here. Oh, I thought I came from over here. No,
[12737.02s -> 12767.30s]  never mind. Hold on. No, I thought I came from up there. Oh, Jesus. Bring him down. Kill him.
[12773.74s -> 12791.46s]  Why is it running? Shit. Emulator. Hold on. I need to shake my hand because holding a Wiimote
[12791.46s -> 12798.94s]  forward for three and a half hours sucks. They didn't think about that though. It was just play
[12798.94s -> 12818.30s]  with your grandmother Wii Sports for 15 minutes. All right, I'm ready. Eggs. Split this up for a
[12818.30s -> 12840.54s]  second. Hold on. No, no, no. Get over here. I want to get everybody up here. Oh, stand on that. Back
[12840.54s -> 12886.47s]  up. Can I not get everybody up here? I'm trying to like weigh this down so I can't. Oh, we need
[12886.47s -> 12905.78s]  that guy. Oh my God. Hold on. I got to take a break. I got to like stretch my arms. My right
[12905.78s -> 12915.22s]  elbow is dying right now from holding my hand forward like I'm changing the channel on a TV
[12915.22s -> 12935.03s]  station. Hold on. Oh, shit. Pause the game. I kicked tennis elbow. Wii elbow. End of the stream.
[12935.03s -> 12947.03s]  No, not yet. Let me stand up. All right. I wish I could do... You know what? I wish I could do this
[12947.03s -> 12954.36s]  with my eyes. See, they really fucked up this technology. Imagine the Wiimote pointer. You
[12954.36s -> 12964.63s]  could just do it with your eyes. Let's try this again. Instead of having to like lean forward
[12964.63s -> 12975.72s]  and like creep and hold my hand out. All right, so you stay here. Get over here. No,
[12976.28s -> 13006.39s]  why do you keep giving me people? Why can't I fucking do this?
[13008.89s -> 13023.02s]  I'm missing something very important here. Why can't I do this? I'm just going to throw them up
[13023.02s -> 13043.05s]  there. I thought I'm not supposed to like move to get on the escalator elevator with like two
[13043.05s -> 13048.42s]  people or something. I'm starting to really hate this fucking controller more than anything.
[13049.14s -> 13075.03s]  Oh, God. Oh, go! No, don't go. Louis, are you not strong enough to do this shit?
[13075.75s -> 13088.68s]  Why is it? Why can you do it now? All right. Fuck off, all of you. I'm running out of daylight
[13088.68s -> 13122.68s]  here. Fuck this controller. It was made for three games. All right, you take this guy back.
[13122.68s -> 13145.90s]  What, can they? Baste and rage pill. I'm serious. This controller works well in like 12 games out
[13145.90s -> 13163.78s]  of 5,000. All right, Louis is down there. Can I do anything else here while they get that gate?
[13163.78s -> 13191.50s]  Can we take this? Oh, we can. Get it. Bring it back. I'm out of time. We're out of time. Can
[13191.50s -> 13200.66s]  these guys even get down here? Let's just walk off the edge. The wheat moat through the screen
[13200.66s -> 13213.51s]  already. I know it's almost time. I know, I know, I know, I know. Can you guys get this please in
[13213.51s -> 13223.50s]  time? Come on, you can do it. There's a huge thing in here. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come
[13223.50s -> 13283.91s]  on. They couldn't do it. They couldn't do it. They couldn't do it. Okay. Wait, left behind? Wait,
[13283.91s -> 13296.14s]  how many? 30 people were left. No, they were. I thought I went down there with Louis. Fucking
[13296.14s -> 13305.37s]  elevator. Yeah, why is it even there? Fucking stupid elevator. For what? I'm going to throw
[13305.37s -> 13311.29s]  the Pikmin up. I throw them over the elevator. I was so hell bent on figuring out what I need
[13311.29s -> 13330.50s]  to do with the elevator. Just throw them over there. I went to Happy Hawkatate Savings and Loan,
[13330.50s -> 13335.53s]  but it seems my loan came from the shop next door, all devouring black hole loan sharks.
[13336.92s -> 13360.02s]  That sounds bad. Okay, I'm going to go back here. Did they even get the... They got it back in time,
[13360.02s -> 13384.23s]  right? Did they get the big guy? Or did they not get the big guy? All right, let's go. We lost one
[13384.23s -> 13409.02s]  big guy. Damn it. All right, everybody follow me. I want to go back to that gate. This time I'm not
[13409.02s -> 13420.41s]  going to sit here for 12 minutes fighting the stupid elevator. All right, can I go in here?
[13421.13s -> 13441.56s]  Whoa, what is this? A maze? Kind of. You all right? Did somebody die? Well, just keep up with the
[13441.56s -> 13445.80s]  group. What the fuck are you doing? Why would you stop to fight that thing? We're all clearly
[13445.80s -> 13463.24s]  running this way. What are you, insane? It's cruel. All right, let's do this stupid thing again and
[13463.24s -> 13509.82s]  I'm just going to just go up. Louis, you stay down here. We're just going to say you're a cool guy.
[13509.82s -> 13537.99s]  Hey, thanks. This thing's dead. Oh, you little things. Okay, this way. Get it. That was a shitty
[13537.99s -> 13550.14s]  reaction. I mean, thank you. For a second, I thought it was sarcastic. It may have been.
[13551.10s -> 13564.66s]  Did they get it? Good. Okay, so now there it is. There's the yellow ship. All right,
[13564.66s -> 13585.48s]  I've discovered yellow ship. Hello. Okay. Okay. Hi, guys. Hey, can we fart together the next
[13585.48s -> 13593.37s]  TwitchCon? No. The yellow Pikmin have climbed down the tree. They appear to like high places and
[13593.37s -> 13601.53s]  seem to be quite light. They have very large ears. Ear Pikmin, but I will give them the name
[13601.53s -> 13608.04s]  Olimar gave them. My static electricity sensors are reaching violently. What could that mean?
[13608.68s -> 13622.26s]  It means they're electric. All right, now we can deposit the things here. Let's do that now. That's
[13622.26s -> 13635.38s]  a big 10. Bring it into the ship. Where are you going? Where are you going? Where are you going?
[13635.38s -> 13649.91s]  Where are you going? Where are you going? It has to be yellow that picks them up? Oh, it has to be
[13649.91s -> 13662.73s]  predominantly yellow that carries them. Okay, I see. Get back here. Look.
[13666.98s -> 13674.33s]  Okay. Well, hold on. You little dicks. All right. Spread out.
[13683.48s -> 13710.49s]  Fuck. Louis, go get that guy. Wait. Louis, stay down there. Oh, don't let red take it.
[13711.61s -> 13718.78s]  Where are you letting red take it for? Put it down. Put that down. Put it down. You know what?
[13722.54s -> 13747.64s]  Leave it alone. Bring it. Okay, we're good. How are they going to do this? Wait, why? Where are
[13747.64s -> 13755.74s]  they going with that? They're too far away. Where are they going? Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys,
[13755.74s -> 13761.58s]  guys. Follow me, please. Don't get eaten. You got fucking eaten, you dumb guy. Oh, come on.
[13762.54s -> 13780.60s]  Fuck. No. What? Shit. Come on. You stupid guy. Why would you walk it all the way if you can't
[13780.60s -> 13793.42s]  bring it back? Why would you just go back up there and hang out for a while? Shit. Did somebody just
[13793.42s -> 13819.29s]  die? Give me another one. Okay. Ten. What do I even have up here? I have three yellow Pikmin.
[13820.01s -> 13849.78s]  How did that happen? All right. Everybody spread out. Oh, shit. Purple doesn't have a place. Oh,
[13849.78s -> 13861.40s]  nice. Okay. Purple doesn't have a... Doesn't... Excuse me. Excuse me. This really is just
[13861.40s -> 13871.21s]  chaperoning a field trip. Everybody get out of the way. My fucking God. Did they just all
[13871.21s -> 13907.86s]  ran off the edge? My God. Are they drowning in water? They're not drowning, right? Okay. Well,
[13908.42s -> 13915.70s]  whatever. All right. There's a big guy over here. I need to collect everybody.
[13920.84s -> 13927.96s]  Louie, you're just going to be stuck back there probably. Too bad. Where's this other three?
[13938.15s -> 13950.42s]  Yellow can jump really high. Oh, that's cool. Oh, shit. They're just like pulling these apart.
[13954.71s -> 13966.31s]  All right. Everyone, we got a full team here. Blue swims, red's fireproof. All right. Stomp them.
[13969.10s -> 13973.66s]  Nice. Good job. Nice work, everybody. Don't even bring them back. What's the point?
[13973.66s -> 13989.94s]  I don't know what that is, but it's freaking me out. Somebody go touch it. What is this? A strange
[13989.94s -> 13995.98s]  mold-like botanical entity has spread across the ground here. Interesting. I am detecting other
[13995.98s -> 14014.49s]  plant life suffocating beneath it. I guess let's save them. Somebody's trapped under here? Somebody's
[14014.49s -> 14025.40s]  suffocating under here? Who is it? Oh, watch out. That's a fire pig.
[14037.61s -> 14051.69s]  Right into the water. Are you shitting me? Don't go into the- My God. What have you done?
[14052.57s -> 14067.13s]  What have you done? Why did they go that way? All right. What are these things doing?
[14068.09s -> 14084.22s]  Are we going to climb this? Oh, it's the- Okay. Cool. We'll get a log. Hold on. Oh,
[14084.22s -> 14094.60s]  they're killing this guy. Get him. Where's everybody? Okay. We're good.
[14099.50s -> 14104.49s]  Knock this down. They're making a bridge.
[14106.65s -> 14140.49s]  Oh, okay. Of course. Nice work, everybody. Kill, kill, kill. We're good? We're good. That was a
[14140.49s -> 14146.79s]  blue one. All right. Back here. Dude, are they getting chased? No. All right. We're good.
[14152.12s -> 14164.12s]  I can't get these. I'm enjoying this stream because I don't know what Jeremy's supposed
[14164.12s -> 14172.79s]  to be doing, so I can't get mad at him. This is ultra bitter essence. It does not appear to have
[14172.79s -> 14186.47s]  any monetary value, but I should research this. This is another spray. Same? Well, I have to get
[14186.47s -> 14205.10s]  more specimens. Oh, no, I don't. No, I don't. Where is everybody? Where is everybody? Where's
[14205.10s -> 14227.34s]  everybody? There's nobody over here. Just Louis. Can Louis die? All right. Louis will get everybody
[14227.34s -> 14257.69s]  else. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Is it for yellow? Where are they? Where are they? Where is
[14257.69s -> 14282.58s]  he? Got one. Okay. Where's the other one? What about the other ones? Oh, I got them all. Yes.
[14282.58s -> 14317.54s]  This game looks boring. It's kind of just a game to play for fun. It's good. Dodge the situation
[14317.54s -> 14322.01s]  with your parents. I need to make more money. I need to make $10,000. I'm only a third of the
[14322.01s -> 14335.74s]  way there. Who died at sunset? One died at sunset today. It's like a cop of my loan agent. He's got
[14335.74s -> 14352.58s]  a scary voice. His voice is very scary. Are we going to have a raid coming in? What's the raid?
[14355.22s -> 14367.06s]  Slime raid? Oh, let me see. Let me see. Let me see. Slimecicle came in with almost 2300 people.
[14367.06s -> 14374.09s]  What's going on, everybody? Thank you, Slimecicle. We're playing Pikmin. Very fun. I've never played
[14374.09s -> 14377.37s]  Pikmin before. It was my first experience playing Pikmin 2 jumping right to the sequel because
[14378.09s -> 14388.54s]  I heard it was better. It'll be a good stream. Whatever you're doing. Raid song for them. No,
[14388.54s -> 14402.84s]  I don't do a raid song. You guys say we do, but I don't. I've never heard of this before. No,
[14402.84s -> 14412.60s]  I'm so bad at coming up with lyrics. I can't do it. I can't do it. Hey, thanks for joining
[14413.16s -> 14426.42s]  this morning. How's your mother? Hope she's well. I don't know. There's an electric fence here.
[14427.22s -> 14437.53s]  This is why nobody likes us, chat. I didn't say it, but hey, you can't just...
[14439.48s -> 14446.58s]  What do you mean? What do you mean this is why nobody likes us? Do we have some type of
[14446.58s -> 14457.21s]  reputation that I don't know about? What do you mean? What are you talking about? We're going to
[14457.21s -> 14477.93s]  go 30. We're going to do... Let's go like this. Bad reputation. Take all the purples. Okay,
[14477.93s -> 14486.87s]  that leaves us with... I'm just going to do mostly red now. Do I have any white? I don't think there's
[14486.87s -> 14497.14s]  gas on this level. I don't think I need it. Maybe I will. Why not? I'll finish it off with yellow.
[14497.70s -> 14510.25s]  Where do these guys come from? Oh, there was yellow there. Okay. All right, here we go.
[14516.44s -> 14524.55s]  Welcome to the stream, guys. My name is Jerma. I want this to be yellow. Oh, whatever.
[14525.35s -> 14530.73s]  Everything changes. Why don't you grab it? We're running out of time. Let's go.
[14535.11s -> 14544.89s]  These kids look dope. Thank you. All right, I need this electric fence somewhere over here.
[14547.21s -> 14564.31s]  I know it. I remember it. Did he die? Where's the electric fence? The fuck is dying over here?
[14564.87s -> 14582.41s]  Something's blinking. Beetle. That's the beetle that we tried to find last time. Get him. Break
[14582.41s -> 14590.81s]  his shell. He's dropping coins and shit. Keep going. More, more, more, more, more, more, more.
[14601.16s -> 14612.94s]  I can give them a free one, right? I guess so. Can I just do it? Oh, nice. Behind you.
[14619.26s -> 14624.94s]  There's a piece of treasure. The white can dig, can't they? Is there a way I can make them dig?
[14625.50s -> 14656.10s]  Where is this? It's up there. Yes. Dig it out. What is it? Let them dig. Oh, it's like a coconut.
[14656.10s -> 14676.73s]  What is that? Oh, it's, I don't know, like a seed or something. He might as well take his dead body.
[14688.30s -> 14701.83s]  It's like a plant. Children bulb. This is very sad. These guys are so cute, though. They really are.
[14701.83s -> 14718.41s]  They're the cutest. Everybody move. I want yellow to take that. Why are you bringing it?
[14719.21s -> 14740.63s]  Why is it red now? What are you people doing? Bring it to yellow. I feel like I'm running out
[14740.63s -> 14751.35s]  of space. Do I have enough space for all these people? You don't want that. I already have a lot
[14751.35s -> 14755.19s]  of red. All right. That's what I'm, I remember that. That's why I came here. And I also want to do
[14755.19s -> 14777.40s]  electricity. Where is that? Oh, plant life. One of these things. This way. Where's that electric
[14777.40s -> 14790.73s]  fence up here? Why is he still playing this? Um, correct me if I'm wrong here, but you don't
[14790.73s -> 14797.80s]  really just like play Pikmin for 15 minutes. It's not like, oh, I'm going to play this for like 20
[14797.80s -> 14816.06s]  minutes. What's wrong with this? There we go. Okay. I do want some of these. Not ready yet?
[14816.06s -> 14841.42s]  Oh, fine. Treasure somewhere. The buried treasure. I don't care about that right now. Kill it. Kill
[14841.42s -> 14851.21s]  it. Kill it. Kill it. Kill it. Kill it. Kill it. Kill it. Good job. I want yellow to take that.
[14858.18s -> 14867.94s]  No, no, no. Yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow. I want yellow. I feel like the
[14867.94s -> 14878.90s]  level's not big enough. All right. Take it. We have to keep harvesting people. Leave them alone.
[14884.12s -> 14902.47s]  All right. Electricity was, oh, gas. Nice. All right. I can get this done. I need the white.
[14907.43s -> 14915.98s]  You know what to do. Get over there. Okay. They're going to be working on that.
[14917.11s -> 14920.39s]  Now let's take this guy back. It's going to be red. That's fine.
[14925.51s -> 14929.94s]  What does that lead to? Another elevator. Great. Spray, spray, spray them, spray them, spray,
[14929.94s -> 14942.86s]  spray, spray. Can I spray them, spray them, then throw them back? Here we go. Go for it.
[14943.42s -> 14956.34s]  All right. Now what? Wait till that's done and then...
[14957.22s -> 14975.61s]  Fuckin' arm. Where's this treasure? It's up there, right? How do we get up there though?
[14976.65s -> 14985.94s]  Oh, okay. This way. End of the stream. No, not yet. You know what? Hey.
[14987.14s -> 14990.42s]  Louis, go get those guys. There's like 10 electricity dudes over here.
[14991.06s -> 15015.24s]  You guys said yellow can jump higher, right? Excuse me. Yellow can be thrown higher. Okay.
[15015.24s -> 15025.62s]  Let's see if I can get it. This is going to kill me, isn't it? Are they going to get it?
[15025.62s -> 15032.33s]  Where are they going to bring it? Oh, shit. They can just fall down. Nice. All right. What is that?
[15032.33s -> 15057.38s]  Chapstick? Oh, hell yeah. That I... Who hasn't drank out of this? A lot of the yellows. Okay, good.
[15061.86s -> 15078.47s]  That wall almost down. That's a glip one. Chapstick. Healing cask. I'm going to keep
[15078.47s -> 15081.11s]  these guys back here because I'm afraid to go over there because it's almost time to leave.
[15082.15s -> 15096.63s]  They almost got it. Electric fence is up here. I'm coming back here next level. You got it. Yes.
[15098.39s -> 15114.82s]  We're good? All right. Now. Fucking elevator. The things I hate the most.
[15116.18s -> 15141.80s]  I didn't mean to do that. The fucking Wiimote. I swear to God.
[15141.80s -> 15156.30s]  I didn't want to do that. I started to get really, really heated in my brain.
[15165.96s -> 15170.60s]  No. Oh, my God. This Wiimote. I'm going to fucking swallow it whole. I swear to God.
[15171.32s -> 15201.82s]  Come on, bring it. Get it down here. Let's go. Yes. Get some more of these berries. I demand it.
[15208.28s -> 15221.53s]  Imagine losing to a fucking scale. Stop. This game used to make me bite my Wiimote. Okay. I doubt it.
[15225.37s -> 15240.70s]  All right. Come back. Come back. Come back. Okay. We got to go. There's other ones here. Where are
[15240.70s -> 15257.42s]  they? I'm not missing anybody, right? That's the ship. Where's Louis? White Flower Garden?
[15257.98s -> 15266.81s]  Wait. What the hell is that? I think I'm good. There are 32 that are free. Where are they?
[15267.93s -> 15280.68s]  That's it, right? Five that are free. Where are they? I think it's the blue ones. We're good.
[15281.24s -> 15297.93s]  Yeah, we're good. We're good. All right. I want to come back here and I want to go back
[15297.93s -> 15302.60s]  up to the top there. Actually, maybe I can't. I think I did everything I can do here for now.
[15303.16s -> 15322.14s]  I could go in there, but hmm. Oh, there's an electric fence up there. That's right.
[15322.14s -> 15332.36s]  I'll go back. I like this game. It's fun. This game is really cool. We'll probably play this again.
[15332.92s -> 15359.64s]  We'll probably do this again on Sunday. I'm not in the stream. Super Bowl Sunday. I don't care who's
[15359.64s -> 15365.78s]  in the Super Bowl anymore. Tom Brady's not in Patriot anymore. You have to say that. You have
[15365.78s -> 15373.34s]  to say that. You have to say Super Bowl. Whatever. I don't even fucking care. I'm playing Pigment on
[15373.34s -> 15383.83s]  Sunday. Hi, Papa. Mama heard you got a promotion, so she's very happy. You have lots of people under
[15383.83s -> 15396.89s]  you now, right? So does this mean you're a super captain? It's 1130 at night. Son, you're calling
[15396.89s -> 15416.23s]  me. Why are you not in bed? You're supposed to be in bed at 1030. It's a different planet.
[15417.19s -> 15428.34s]  I'm angry because it's local time here. All right. We're getting a lot of yellows because
[15428.34s -> 15436.95s]  an electric fence that I want to get to. I got 55 yellows. Holy shit. Let's do 30 yellow.
[15436.95s -> 15452.68s]  30 yellow and a bunch of purple. And then I think, should I even bring any? I'll bring like two.
[15453.40s -> 15472.90s]  We'll bring four and then the rest spread. It's 95. Cool. All right. Let's go to the electric fence,
[15479.90s -> 15489.50s]  which was up this way. Do you know that Joel thought you were a Christian streamer that
[15489.50s -> 15500.95s]  didn't swear before he started talking to me? Well, you guys did that. What's your doing?
[15500.95s -> 15517.03s]  That's not my doing. Where's that electric fence? Right there. Okay. Oh, a stupid elevator.
[15531.26s -> 15578.17s]  You get on there. Where did you go? Oh, oh, they all fell off. Joker laugh. Whatever.
[15584.33s -> 15588.25s]  They should profile you in the newspaper. Why? So like fucking 15 people can read it.
[15588.89s -> 15606.20s]  It was like kind of rude. All right. We're going to go up here. Only bring yellow up here.
[15612.09s -> 15616.89s]  That was extremely rude. You millionaire. No, that's not what I was talking about. I'm talking about
[15616.89s -> 15625.69s]  that. Like who? Okay. Let's go ahead and go over this because a lot of you. When was the last time
[15625.69s -> 15632.73s]  anybody in this chat read a newspaper? Say one. One in the chat. I'm serious. When was the last
[15632.73s -> 15644.38s]  time any of you read a newspaper? You're, you're a liar. And no, no, no, no. I'm not talking about
[15644.38s -> 15649.74s]  like an online publication of a newspaper. I'm talking about a newspaper that you hold and fold
[15649.74s -> 15669.03s]  in your hand. All right. Wait, should I fart on them? All right. Get in there. Let's go take that
[15669.03s -> 15680.94s]  down. It's free. So I read it. I literally get my New York times delivered. I don't think you do.
[15681.50s -> 15701.16s]  I'm missing a couple of guys up here. Come on. You can do it. There's a lot of you guys down here.
[15701.16s -> 15721.50s]  Come on. Let's go. I can't tell you the last time I read a newspaper. Reddit.com is most of the
[15721.50s -> 15742.14s]  millennial generation's newspaper. Am I a boomer? I'm, I'm not a boomer. I'm a millennial. Just like
[15742.14s -> 15752.02s]  you. We're the same. Okay, cool. So now there's another place to go. Should I go down here? Let's
[15752.02s -> 15765.98s]  see. Uh, where's, hold on. You guys stay there. NX? No, I'm, I'm a millennial. I'm a millennial.
[15767.11s -> 15803.35s]  Yes, I am. And they all even fit up here. Not really. Rod German, you're five years younger than
[15803.35s -> 15842.74s]  my mom, mate. You're not like me. How old are you? 39, 39, 40. I, yeah, I am kind of old, aren't I?
[15842.74s -> 15856.94s]  I wasn't even reading any of that. What did it say? That guy could be like 21. Oh shit. Oh my God.
[15856.94s -> 15887.67s]  I'm too old. I'm way too old. I'm a dinosaur now. But I don't need a blue Pikmin in here.
[15887.67s -> 15900.14s]  Ooh, what's this? Wait, is this a red flower? I don't think I want to turn anybody red. Is this
[15900.14s -> 15929.82s]  orange or red? I don't think I want red. That guy looks scary. Hey guys, we're the big guys.
[15930.62s -> 15946.17s]  Oh shit, he killed a few people. Okay. Easy. Easy. Oh shit, there's a lot of those guys.
[15946.89s -> 15981.14s]  I want, I want purple first. Easy. Help me. Relax. Ooh, what'd he drop? What is that? It's a jewel.
[15981.78s -> 16003.72s]  There's such an overreaction to that. Oh, there's a guy on me. Okay. 150, that's a lot.
[16003.72s -> 16028.46s]  We're still clover. I am going to turn some reds into lights here. It's okay to react to things.
[16028.46s -> 16045.93s]  Yeah, I know. I'm just kidding around. All right, let's keep going. 91, that's it. All right, what
[16045.93s -> 16069.45s]  else? What is it? I don't know if I should turn. No, he's reacting. Someone stop him. Remember,
[16069.45s -> 16075.62s]  why is your chat the weird table in lunch class? Did you just hear me do the doy doy doy to
[16075.62s -> 16086.95s]  Megalovania? This is, uh, it's kind of, I think it's been like this for a little while.
[16093.16s -> 16100.04s]  Yeah, that was lunch class. I love that. I'm going to, I'm going to talk. I'm going to say
[16100.04s -> 16116.23s]  it like that from now on. Lunch class. I love that. Does this guy fire? Get him. Don't put
[16116.23s -> 16133.67s]  his head. They're immune to fire. What do you think you're doing? God, I'm sorry. I'm having
[16133.67s -> 16142.54s]  like too much fun just being like a fucking weirdo. I'm sorry guys. Uh, let's take these guys. Diamond.
[16163.53s -> 16171.05s]  All right, when do you pick it up? Uh, now I want, uh, I want you guys to go get that diamond.
[16172.01s -> 16191.50s]  Pack it up. Oh, wait a minute. Now that's a really bad idea. I have to do that with red. I did not
[16191.50s -> 16226.25s]  even notice the geysers. Jewel. Ah, thank you. I'll get stuck. That was a good clean run. Nobody
[16226.25s -> 16231.78s]  died. What are you going to have for lunch? Um, that's a good question. What do you feel like?
[16237.13s -> 16242.58s]  What do I feel like? That's another good question. What do you wish I get? Oh, by the way, I want to
[16242.58s -> 16248.58s]  give you guys a quick little update on something. So I mentioned something called the archaeology
[16248.58s -> 16259.56s]  stream. Uh, trying to get a solid date on it. We're very close to giving a true solid date on
[16259.56s -> 16268.14s]  the archaeology stream and it will be as long as we get a confirmation on it. If it's confirmed,
[16268.70s -> 16277.27s]  it will be within the next 30 days. We've been working on it for a little while. I'll give you
[16277.27s -> 16288.84s]  get just a quick, a quick little, uh, what it is. Well, an archaeology stream. I'm going to be
[16288.84s -> 16311.43s]  opening up a bunch of geodes on stream among other things, among other things, but we're going to be
[16311.43s -> 16320.47s]  opening up geodes from small to big to medium. Oh, no, no, no, no. Don't kill everybody. Please.
[16321.27s -> 16342.06s]  That was terrifying. I thought he killed like a hundred people. There's going to be a lot of
[16342.06s -> 16363.34s]  weird shit on that stream. Should be fun though. More white flour. Hold on. Oh, this is kind of a
[16363.34s -> 16379.64s]  battle. Fight. Everybody fight. Watch out. Everyone move out of the way. Don't let him do it.
[16380.28s -> 16406.15s]  Bring him down. Good. So we'll pick these up. Nobody died. There is a treasure somewhere.
[16409.30s -> 16432.34s]  Done. Let's turn a few, a few more reds into yellows. Oh God. All right. I want red. Get in line
[16432.34s -> 16454.86s]  behind red, please. Come up. All right. I don't want to do it that way. I think there's a lot
[16454.86s -> 16469.69s]  more fire here, so I got to be careful. Louis, don't get stuck behind the plant. Really? That it?
[16471.13s -> 16489.72s]  Okay. Follow me. Follow your nose. Follow. Hold on. My Captain Crunch cereal. I'm working on a Captain
[16489.72s -> 16494.79s]  Crunch. Let me know how you think. My Captain Crunch cereal and crunch berries are full of flavor.
[16495.59s -> 16524.17s]  That's pretty good, right? Somebody just wrote it all caps. Drunk. I guess
[16524.89s -> 16529.45s]  that is something that somebody that was drunk would just do. That is something a drunk person
[16529.45s -> 16534.41s]  would just do. Hey man, we're going to make Captain Crunch. What do you think? My Captain Crunch cereal.
[16535.29s -> 16544.02s]  Just shit faced on the couch. Just eyes closed. Eyes closed on the couch.
[16545.42s -> 16550.38s]  Leaning back, lying back. There's a movie on TV, by the way. We're all watching a movie.
[16551.54s -> 16557.78s]  Eyes closed on the couch just randomly. My Captain Crunch cereal is the most delicious crunch berries.
[16558.34s -> 16567.75s]  It's like fucking Jesus, man. Like stop. It's just trashed. Where is this treasure?
[16568.47s -> 16607.51s]  I'm losing my mind. Where is this treasure? Hey, hey, hey, hey. Pick it up. Trashed.
[16607.67s -> 16653.64s]  Oh, it's a seashell. Oh, sorry. Anautilus. 40 bucks. That's it. Okay. Let's go. I feel like
[16653.64s -> 16662.90s]  I'm going to get my ass kicked. I'm afraid of this. Remember, do you like us? I feel like you hate us.
[16662.90s -> 16680.94s]  Why would I hate you guys? Purple. Nice. Electricity. Oh, all right. All right. Let's do this right.
[16681.90s -> 16693.50s]  First of all, what do we have for a team here? Let me see. Line up. Yeah, we're getting rid of
[16694.46s -> 16715.70s]  more reds. I have so many. You hate us because we bully people when we raid. Hey, you guys,
[16715.70s -> 16733.77s]  people are trying to stream. You can't just bully people that we raid. I know you like to have fun,
[16735.90s -> 16740.57s]  but if somebody's streaming and they don't want to sing a raid song, they don't have to sing a
[16740.57s -> 16751.00s]  raid song. Do you really want us to be like a lunch table where only five of us can sit at this
[16751.00s -> 16774.46s]  lunch table? Ooh, nice. Yes, that's what we want. I almost get shocked. Okay, that's good.
[16775.10s -> 16781.85s]  What is more? Electricity. Ooh, more purple. Electric bugs. All right, well, let's go.
[16787.45s -> 16792.09s]  Hold them back. Hold them back. You just killed. Oh, you fucking asshole. Okay, hold on. Pull them
[16792.09s -> 16820.22s]  back. We're going to bait the big guy over here. Shit. Holy shit, I'm fine. Kill it quick. Kill it.
[16820.22s -> 16835.64s]  Kill it. Back up, back up, back up, back up, back up. Okay, separate that again. That could have been
[16835.64s -> 16853.37s]  much worse. That could have been a lot worse. Bring him back. I want to turn the camera. Okay,
[16853.37s -> 16877.37s]  there we go. I think he shit himself. I may have. What happened? Oh, am I religious at all? Not
[16877.37s -> 16897.67s]  really. All right, let's get the... Hold on, not yet. Any more big guys? Everybody come back.
[16898.15s -> 16909.37s]  Now, hey, I'll tell you, I'm not religious. I'm not religious at all. But, I mean, I don't know.
[16909.37s -> 16914.09s]  It could be. Aliens could have made us. They could be a god. I don't know. I have no idea.
[16914.89s -> 16957.40s]  I really have no idea. I couldn't tell you either way. Agnostic Andy. I don't know. I couldn't tell
[16957.40s -> 16965.74s]  you one way or another if like dinosaur poop turned into us. If aliens decided to come by one
[16965.74s -> 16972.31s]  day and drop off like a specimen into the water and just run like it was a fucking prank. I don't
[16972.31s -> 16988.31s]  know. Or if like God created... Watch out, watch out, watch out. No, don't line up that close
[16988.31s -> 17002.81s]  together. That would be a pretty good prank. You know what I mean though? I don't know. We could
[17002.81s -> 17035.27s]  be an experiment. What's going on in here? Something in there. All right, drag him out.
[17035.83s -> 17056.90s]  Get out. Get out here. Get out of your hole. He doesn't want to come out. It's too bad
[17056.90s -> 17079.24s]  because I think there's probably something in here. Golden fucking bug! Whoa. What is that?
[17079.24s -> 17084.52s]  I just got a golden bug. That's like a... Holy shit. Okay, cool. What does that get me? Does it
[17084.52s -> 17106.38s]  get me anything? I got a gold bug. That's it for a golden bug? I don't think that's enough.
[17106.38s -> 17114.55s]  I think that's more. I need more. I want to kill this guy. But, you know, can I flip him over with
[17114.55s -> 17126.44s]  a big dude? All right, everyone get him now. Don't let him get up. Overwhelm him. All right,
[17126.44s -> 17141.43s]  now bring him back. I got all the treasures. Cool. Nice. Did you not get it? Come on. You
[17141.43s -> 17163.90s]  cannot pick that up. Come on, boy. Of course, you can. Who hasn't eaten? A lot of the purple's
[17163.90s -> 17173.61s]  haven't. Ooh, nice, nice, nice, nice. Okay, cool, cool, cool. Now what? Do I have everybody?
[17174.65s -> 17180.71s]  I think I do. Yeah, let's keep going. I got all the treasures.
[17180.71s -> 17206.39s]  All back's kingdom. Is this a boss? I'm going to get another boss. I don't know.
[17206.39s -> 17225.61s]  It's still not the bottom. Shit. Okay, hold on. Why not? I'm really getting the hang of this. I'm
[17225.61s -> 17241.90s]  starting to understand this a lot. Devon chat. Real Devon. Why is everybody saying that? Seven
[17241.90s -> 17258.97s]  gold? That's not that much. Because they're here. I'm just hitting the head. Who hasn't eaten?
[17259.69s -> 17284.18s]  Pine cone. I think everybody has eaten. Look at that. We got full bellies all around. 50 cents
[17284.18s -> 17291.85s]  or coins. Those look like Mario coins. That's not it. There's another one in here somewhere.
[17291.85s -> 17297.58s]  Oh no, that's it. All right. This was kind of a small area. This is randomly generated. This
[17297.58s -> 17333.46s]  seems tiny. Level five? That's a bomb. Okay, this is bombs. Level six. Hello, Mr. Otto. What's the
[17333.46s -> 17350.82s]  matter? Are you hungry? Me too. We're still not at the end. All right, this looks dangerous. I'm
[17350.82s -> 17368.78s]  going to go this way. More red. All right, same deal. Okay, good. Pick up that medallion. Holy shit.
[17368.78s -> 17379.22s]  All right, cool. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Call back, back, back, back, back, back, back,
[17379.22s -> 17396.44s]  everybody back, everybody back. That was my mistake. I fucked it up. I thought I could throw it over
[17396.44s -> 17413.45s]  the guy's body. Mr. Noodle? Mr. Noodle? Mr. Noodle? Mr. Noodle? I am a fucking bird. I really am.
[17414.09s -> 17419.48s]  Entry. This creature showed symptoms of poisoning after consuming the white pikmin.
[17420.04s -> 17432.26s]  Perhaps white pikmin excreted poisonous substance when chewed. How fascinating. Lost a couple people
[17432.26s -> 17447.26s]  though. All right, whatever. What else is in here? Fire stuff. Let's put you guys up. Turn off all
[17447.26s -> 17473.38s]  these geysers. Get it. Tell it. These things even fight back. I feel like they don't. Oh, fuck. Pull
[17473.38s -> 17478.50s]  back, back, back, back, back, back, back. There's a bomb in there. Pull back, pull back. I think I'm
[17478.50s -> 17494.71s]  good. All right. Let's just clean this up. Pick all this stuff up. Any of my other buddies? Where's
[17494.71s -> 17506.31s]  Louis? Oh. Look at all that nectar. It's too bad I don't even need to use it. Everybody's already
[17506.31s -> 17541.64s]  pretty much maxed out. I'll take the money though. Oh, hold on. 81. All right. Again, bring the fire
[17541.64s -> 17562.97s]  over. Can't kill it. None of them landed on his head. That's kind of weird. BF bugler is in check.
[17566.70s -> 17576.95s]  Oh, I can't believe it. Oh, more purple. Purple.
[17591.69s -> 17603.54s]  No fucking way. No way he's in check. There's a buried treasure somewhere. I don't know where.
[17604.18s -> 17613.06s]  Maybe we can recover all the energy in the radar room. When we find that beta,
[17613.06s -> 17647.75s]  we'll find Dr. Bob. Sorry. I'm so fucking high. Are these guys fire? Me too. I'm not, actually.
[17650.28s -> 17660.01s]  Okay. There is a treasure in here. Oh, no. How am I ever going to get that?
[17660.89s -> 17682.82s]  That's the blunt. I don't smoke marijuana. I mean, I do, but not that, not really that often.
[17684.04s -> 17703.86s]  Once in a blue moon. Let's get that skull. 81. Let's go. Once an hour.
[17712.44s -> 17715.06s]  Is that a bomb? Run, please.
[17718.58s -> 17728.12s]  He didn't make it. He didn't make it. He tried. It's okay. Poor purple Pikmin number 25.
[17729.08s -> 17740.79s]  So, just to clarify again, it doesn't matter. They just have to be alive down here, right?
[17741.51s -> 17768.34s]  I can just go in. Okay, cool. 140. Am I almost halfway through the game? Is 10,000 the debt?
[17769.06s -> 17784.84s]  After 10,000, that's not even close. Really? Oh, shit. Okay. Full debt is halfway. Oh, wow.
[17784.84s -> 17797.22s]  Okay. Here we go. Final floor. Let's do this carefully. There's definitely a boss down here.
[17798.18s -> 17818.26s]  Fire only. Snakes in here and shit. Hold on. Are they fire snakes? Are they fire snakes?
[17818.82s -> 17832.95s]  They might be. Those are eyes. Oh, shit. Okay. People are going to die. People are dead. Like,
[17832.95s -> 17850.22s]  let's just be honest. What's the strategy here? I want purples on... I want reds and purples
[17852.12s -> 17868.01s]  on Olimar. Or no, just purple on one. I want only red on Olimar so I can be...
[17868.01s -> 17877.74s]  I can be... Okay, that's what I'm doing. No. What do I want? That's it.
[17882.31s -> 17886.28s]  Should I leave the other ones here? Maybe it's not even worth bringing them.
[17887.72s -> 17898.78s]  Because aren't they just going to die? If it's a fire boss, then I feel like they're just going to
[17898.86s -> 17910.38s]  die. Let's try it. Let's see what happens. Okay. I don't know what he's... I don't know.
[17911.18s -> 17918.54s]  Run, run, run, run. Just run. See what he does. What does he do? Is he like a charge move or
[17918.54s -> 17931.37s]  something? Probably charges. He's kind of cute. He's kind of cute. And this music is so cute too.
[17932.92s -> 17942.95s]  I haven't seen anything. He doesn't charge. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Don't scoop up enough like
[17942.95s -> 17950.02s]  a whale with a school of fish. Okay, good. He has a big tongue. Where can we go? Oh, my God.
[17950.02s -> 17964.41s]  Don't stand still. Don't throw it in his mouth. Everyone back up. Everybody back...
[17975.66s -> 18015.11s]  Oh, Megazord. It's fascinating. I still have... Oh, he killed so many. So many purples again. My
[18015.11s -> 18031.78s]  purple friends. I'll replace him. It's all right. And there's a gate here. This is just a regular
[18031.78s -> 18047.59s]  gate. There's more. I'm surprised there's more. Well, start working on that. It's a Megazord worth.
[18048.23s -> 18059.30s]  That's it. I'm a boss. Material has perplexing properties. I will try fusing with a spare
[18059.30s -> 18069.29s]  space suit. Health increase. I let us mention the Scorch Guard. Thanks to the heat-resistant
[18069.29s -> 18089.21s]  alloy, this suit is now impervious to fire. That's cool. The rest of you, get over there.
[18101.86s -> 18109.48s]  Got it. What's the point of the second part here? There's another treasure here, but where is it?
[18110.12s -> 18124.73s]  Let me see. I have to take fire, guys, with me. Wait, can I even do that?
[18136.07s -> 18190.84s]  I fell. Shit, I can't get that. Yeah, I can. Follow me. Thank you. You know what to do. Take
[18190.84s -> 18217.27s]  that out. Hey, now can I? Now go get it. Come on, two more through. Get up there. Get up there,
[18217.27s -> 18256.44s]  guys. Really? Get it. Oh, all right. I'm immune to fire. Bring this shit. Don't go that way. Go
[18256.44s -> 18273.40s]  this way. Thank you. Aha. I did it. Next time I play this, I'm definitely turning off the sound
[18273.40s -> 18294.90s]  thing. If they went into the water, that would have been very bad. What's this one worth? It's
[18294.90s -> 18300.81s]  cute. Well, my compressor is making it so you don't hear it all the time, but make no mistake.
[18305.16s -> 18320.74s]  It's just doing this forever. 250. Holy shit. Nice. Turn it off in five seconds. Press the home
[18320.74s -> 18326.70s]  button. Yeah, but I think I'm going to start with that because then people will know that it's
[18326.70s -> 18331.40s]  turned off, and people will be very upset if I turn it off now, won't they? They'll be like,
[18331.40s -> 18334.68s]  I wanted that. Why'd you get rid of that? If I start with that on Sunday, I'll just be like,
[18334.68s -> 18354.31s]  hey, it's off. People will be like, oh, it's off. I know. I'm just kidding around. That's a lot of
[18354.31s -> 18372.20s]  money today. 1350. Cave complete. I think that's probably a good place to stop, too.
[18378.06s -> 18390.98s]  After this day is over, I think this is a good place to stop. 40% of debt recovered. What else
[18390.98s -> 18399.18s]  can I do here today before the time runs out? Hmm. I'm not sure there is anything I can do.
[18399.82s -> 18420.78s]  Did I get the blues? Wait, let me refill. Give me some more reds. All right. 95 Pikmin. Let's go.
[18421.50s -> 18429.77s]  Where's the blues? So if I go through here and around, blue is that way. Okay.
[18442.41s -> 18461.43s]  Ooh, there's a yellow thing here, too. Interesting. Okay. All right. Where is it at? Wait.
[18461.43s -> 18470.79s]  That's where I need to go. Okay. Here's the plan. I'm going to throw you over here,
[18470.79s -> 18501.66s]  and then I'm going to run around the side. Everybody up. That was painful. Wait, why?
[18501.66s -> 18522.07s]  I want to bring everybody up here. Look there. A wild blue Pikmin are chasing prey near the
[18522.07s -> 18533.30s]  water's edge. You can split up the captains. Oh, yeah. That's right. This is why I heard the
[18533.30s -> 18537.06s]  Pikmin 2 is the worst one. It's like the whole splitting the captains thing. I heard that that
[18537.06s -> 18542.74s]  was a reason why everyone didn't like this one. There's like 12 on Rotten Tomatoes. I get it now.
[18542.74s -> 18549.21s]  I apologize. I was momentarily entranced by them. Now back to work.
[18560.76s -> 18573.05s]  Bad angle. Oh, yeah. I know this is universally the most loved one. I know. That's the reason why
[18573.05s -> 18576.65s]  I'm playing it right now. I would have started with one if that were not the case, right?
[18586.62s -> 18592.06s]  Get away from the fence. What are you doing? Why would you do that? That was not smart.
[18596.20s -> 18615.72s]  Where are you going with that? Oh, I guess fine. Go ahead. One's actually better, but don't tell
[18615.72s -> 18624.63s]  anyone. I mean, this is really good. This is very fun. I don't know how much more different
[18624.63s -> 18636.10s]  the first one is. The time limit was really scary as a kid. It was scary as an adult too.
[18636.82s -> 18657.30s]  Come on, you can get it. Come on, break it down. In Pikmin 1, you had 30 in-game days. That's it?
[18657.30s -> 18665.37s]  Well, is this day like six? I'm on like day six or seven and I don't even have the blue Pikmin yet.
[18665.93s -> 18683.16s]  It's day nine, right? OK. I know it says it in the top right corner, but I am currently looking
[18683.16s -> 18692.04s]  over at a chat room. I'm staring at the chat, reading what you guys are saying. Since I brought
[18692.04s -> 18719.29s]  that up, I have been looking at the chat box. I don't have four sets of eyes. All right, let's go.
[18719.29s -> 18742.54s]  How do I do this? Wait, nobody move. Don't. Please. If I walk in the water, this is going to die.
[18742.54s -> 18748.84s]  You shit-eating dumb fuck. Why do I have to be eating shit?
[18750.71s -> 18754.57s]  At last you have encountered them. They seem to have gill-like ducks on their cheeks.
[18755.21s -> 18761.54s]  They must be blue Pikmin. Like the other types, they look like they want to talk to you.
[18765.14s -> 18787.51s]  He looks really fucked up right now. All right, come to me over here. Deliver that. Deliver this.
[18788.15s -> 18800.02s]  They're just fighting these tadpoles. Not yet. We're not strong enough yet.
[18802.41s -> 18818.46s]  Not yet, I said. Are you eating them out of the ground? Better not be. Kind of hard to see.
[18823.75s -> 18843.85s]  Oh, fuck. Hurry up. Come on. Hurry up. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
[18843.85s -> 18847.61s]  Get it. Get it. Get it. All five of you. All five of you, pick it up. Get on it.
[18855.88s -> 18861.64s]  Gone. Okay, that was really fun. Come on. Excuse me.
[18868.22s -> 18889.86s]  We did it. We made the other 100. Where are they? There's 20 somewhere. Where? Oh my god.
[18889.86s -> 18913.10s]  There they are, the other ship. No. Weemote, please. Did I get it? I think I got it. I was
[18913.10s -> 18920.42s]  trying to get the motion over there all the way to the edge. I skipped it. I didn't even mean to.
[18921.14s -> 18942.84s]  They're fine. They're at the base. Okay, cool. Game is stressful. We made a lot of money. We died.
[18942.84s -> 18951.78s]  A lot of purples died. Yeah, 34 died today. Three died from like, one from explosion. Oh right,
[18951.78s -> 18965.86s]  in the cave. You made it stressful by sitting at the gate all day. It's all good though.
[18966.50s -> 18979.80s]  It's all good. Almost 5,000 out of 10,000. Cool. So now that I have water, I can do
[18979.80s -> 18993.35s]  most of the shit over here. That'll be for another day. So I am not streaming tomorrow.
[18993.35s -> 18996.23s]  I ran into the unfortunate problem of I was supposed to stream yesterday,
[18997.03s -> 19003.37s]  but the Twitch server's had problems. So I have something I have to take care of tomorrow. I have
[19003.37s -> 19012.52s]  things, I have some errands I have to run, but I'll be live on Sunday. We will continue Pikmin 2.
[19012.52s -> 19022.17s]  It's really fun. I like it. It's a really good game. And we will pull the stream back on Sunday
[19022.17s -> 19028.95s]  as well. So we're not going to start at 4 30 Pacific on Sunday. We're likely to start somewhere
[19028.95s -> 19043.80s]  around, let's see, somewhere around 1 PM Pacific. Pull it back by a few hours or so.
[19044.68s -> 19052.52s]  So that's it. I'll see you guys on Sunday. Have a wonderful rest of your day, rest of your night.
[19053.32s -> 19057.85s]  Sorry we couldn't stream yesterday, but you know, sometimes shit happens, right?
[19064.63s -> 19069.83s]  I like it. I can't promise that I will beat Pikmin 2, because if what you're telling me
[19069.83s -> 19075.62s]  is true and the game's like 30 to 40 hours long, we might do it one or two more times and see how
[19075.62s -> 19083.75s]  far we get. We'll see. If I still am having fun, I'm still going to play it. He's not going to
[19083.75s -> 19089.90s]  beat it. I don't know. We'll see. Any news on Bionicle? No. The only news that I can share
[19089.90s -> 19095.38s]  with you is there will be an archaeologist stream in the next 30 days. It's the only news
[19095.38s -> 19108.09s]  I have for you right now. Let's do a raid. Let's see who's live right now. Let's go to...
[19115.00s -> 19124.63s]  Let's go to Joel. Joel's playing Super Straight Fighter. It's Fightcade Friday. Sounds like fun.
[19124.63s -> 19143.37s]  Thanks for all the subs, everybody. This list is extreme every single day that I stream.
[19144.09s -> 19152.73s]  This list is... This is a... We essentially have filled an entire guest list of people
[19153.45s -> 19170.58s]  at a fucking party. A concert. Thank you, everybody. Go say hello to Joel. This party sucks.
[19182.73s -> 19187.24s]  We'll see you soon, though. See you on Sunday, around 1 o'clock Pacific.
[19187.24s -> 19191.90s]  Thanks for watching, as always. Have a great night. I'll catch you guys soon.
[19191.90s -> 19209.29s]  Thanks for hanging out. Good night and goodbye.
