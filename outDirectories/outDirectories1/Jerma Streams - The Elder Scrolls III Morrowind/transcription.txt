[1.72s -> 9.72s]  Hold on, we'll go, we'll go full cam for a minute. Okay. Do I, do I have Morrowind? Let's find out.
[11.99s -> 25.69s]  Uh, is Morrowind on steam? No, please. God, you got a big ass head. Actually,
[25.69s -> 29.53s]  this camera makes me look fucking huge, by the way. Look at this. I don't know what it is with
[29.53s -> 35.21s]  this camera, but it, I don't, I think it's fisheye or something. Cause look at how huge it makes me
[35.21s -> 51.96s]  look. Look at this, right? It makes me look fucking huge. Don't I look like stacked? It makes me have
[51.96s -> 66.71s]  like a, I have a good tiny head. That's weird, right? I don't know why, why this is doing this.
[66.71s -> 83.24s]  I swear I don't have, I'm not this like jacked. All right. Where, um, where's Morrowind? How do
[83.24s -> 97.66s]  I get it? It's the tank top? Maybe. Yeah. Do I, I don't, I don't own Morrowind. I don't think.
[98.38s -> 104.76s]  What's it called? Elder Scrolls? I don't own it. Am I actually, is it going to, am I going to buy
[104.76s -> 113.72s]  fucking Morrowind right now? It runs fine. Vanilla. Really? Okay. Well let's get rid of like the giant
[113.72s -> 134.36s]  arms. Okay. Uh, let's get it. Morrowind. It's on sale right now. Is this game actually going to be
[134.36s -> 141.06s]  fun or is this people are going to leave and hate this? It's $4 and 50 cents right now.
[141.06s -> 157.66s]  That's it. Holy shit. It really is 70% off. All right. Let's go for it. I'll get it. Okay. It's
[157.66s -> 176.42s]  coming through. Okay. Here we go. Pog. Pog. Pog. It's only one gig. This is a tiny game. Okay.
[176.42s -> 191.51s]  Morrowind. Can we get a, this is going to be a terrible stream game. Somebody said it's going
[191.51s -> 203.72s]  to be a terrible stream game. Somebody said this is going to suck. This is, this is going to suck.
[204.28s -> 214.52s]  This is going to suck. Well, look, this is, I guess this is what we're doing. Options. It says,
[214.52s -> 219.22s]  wait, it's a separate menu for the, how do I wear my options? Oh God. I think my computer's crashing.
[221.19s -> 235.69s]  Okay. I want, there's no HD resolutions. Full screen 1920 by 1440. I guess that's close enough.
[235.69s -> 267.22s]  It takes a long time to learn. Wait, I think I'm going to have to learn this shit. Hold on.
[267.22s -> 274.87s]  Learning is hard. I mean, I, whatever. We'll see. I'll try it. Can I even capture the game?
[274.87s -> 311.83s]  Let's find out. Okay. Oh, failed to create shader. Continue running executable. Yes.
[314.12s -> 363.38s]  Yes. Continue please. Wait, here it comes. Here it comes. It doesn't work. I think it just turned
[363.38s -> 369.10s]  off now. All right. It just crashed out. We got to see the opening music cut scene. I'm going to try
[369.10s -> 381.64s]  opening it again. Epic music. Fucking epic. The elder scrolls three. This is the elder scrolls
[381.64s -> 399.94s]  three. Dude, it won't, I can't open it. I can't open it. I thought you guys said this worked on
[399.94s -> 408.94s]  windows 10. Do I have to go get a mod? Hold on. I'm going to, I'm going to open it in a window.
[408.94s -> 436.63s]  Okay. Window. Okay. Let's try that. Come on. Do it. Play. Here it comes. Can you see it? Yes.
[437.11s -> 450.28s]  This looks awful on my screen. It's half of my monitor. It's in a cube on the left side of my
[450.28s -> 466.86s]  monitor. Let's go. The elder scrolls three. Morrowind. Can we get the name change of the,
[468.41s -> 475.83s]  you know what I'm saying? Can we get a name change please? The stream name.
[476.47s -> 489.86s]  Oh my God. This text is so small. Why is this so tiny? I can't even see.
[490.82s -> 503.66s]  This is so small. View distance. Real-time shaders. Don't do anything. Don't change anything.
[503.66s -> 524.95s]  Seriously. I'm back. Okay. Okay. New game. Each event is preceded by prophecy, but without the
[524.95s -> 533.93s]  hero, there is no event. In the waning years of the third era of Tamriel, a prisoner born on a
[533.93s -> 538.73s]  certain day to uncertain parents was sent under guard without explanation to Morrowind.
[538.73s -> 541.85s]  Whatever the rest of that says.
[550.73s -> 555.13s]  That's cut off. It's cut off for me too, so don't worry.
[565.02s -> 569.18s]  This dude fucking gave up. I didn't. This was everyone said to play this. Like
[569.18s -> 582.18s]  60% of you said to do this. What? What happened?
[582.98s -> 598.87s]  What's your name? Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. I need to fix this. Okay. There we go.
[600.87s -> 611.26s]  My name. My name is Morrowind. Last night storm could wake you. I heard them say we've reached
[611.26s -> 621.54s]  Morrowind. I'm sure they'll let us go. Quiet. Here comes the guard. This is where you get off.
[621.54s -> 631.75s]  Come with me. W and S move forward and back. A and D move side to side. You better do what they say.
[632.47s -> 665.75s]  Put the death counter up. How could you have died this many times in the tutorial?
[669.56s -> 685.54s]  You're playing music way too loud. Spacebar to open it. Whoa. This is where they want you.
[685.54s -> 692.90s]  Head down to the dock and I'll show you to the census office. You finally arrived,
[692.90s -> 723.53s]  but our records don't show from where. What? Orc, I guess. Great. I'm sure you'll fit right in.
[724.17s -> 729.90s]  Follow me up to the office and they'll finish your release. Oh my God. I'm huge. Hold on.
[735.67s -> 754.70s]  That's as low as I can make it. Yes. We've been expecting you. You'll have to be recorded before
[754.70s -> 760.06s]  you're officially released. There are a few ways we can do this and the choice is yours.
[763.08s -> 767.96s]  Answer his questions. Okay. I'll do it. Yeah. I'll get the controller off of my penis.
[772.26s -> 777.78s]  All right. Generate clip. You chance upon a strange animal. It's leg trapped in a hunter's
[778.10s -> 787.88s]  snare. Judging from the bleeding, it will not survive long. What do you do? Use herbs from your
[787.88s -> 802.30s]  pack to put it to sleep. Whereas save the animal. One summer afternoon, your father gives you a
[802.30s -> 809.56s]  choice of chores. What would you rather do? Go catch fish at the stream using a net and a line.
[809.56s -> 815.67s]  Work in the forge with him casting iron or gather herbs for your mother who is preparing dinner.
[815.67s -> 821.26s]  I would probably do this one. I don't know why it's so small. I can't say anything.
[823.53s -> 832.14s]  Can you talk with a louder font? I would go pick herbs from mom. Your cousin has given you a very
[832.14s -> 838.70s]  embarrassing nickname and even worse likes to call you it in front of your friends. You have asked
[838.70s -> 846.14s]  him to stop, but he finds it very amusing to watch you blush. What do you do? Feed him up and then
[846.14s -> 849.98s]  tell him that if he ever calls you that nickname again, you will bloody him worse than this time.
[850.78s -> 855.50s]  Make up an even more embarrassing nickname for him and use it constantly until he learns his lesson.
[856.06s -> 860.06s]  Make up a story that makes your nickname a badge of honor instead of something humiliating. That
[860.06s -> 873.02s]  one. That one. There is a lot of heated discussion at the local tavern over a group of people called
[873.66s -> 880.62s]  telepaths. They've been hired by certain city state kings. Rumor has it these telepaths read
[880.62s -> 887.10s]  a person's mind and tell their lord whether a follower is telling the truth or not. This is a
[887.10s -> 893.90s]  terrible practice. A person's thoughts are his own and no one, not even a king, has the right to make
[893.90s -> 898.62s]  such invasion into another human's mind. In these times of necessary evil, although you do not
[898.62s -> 903.74s]  necessarily like the idea, a telepath could have certain advantages during a time of war or, well,
[903.74s -> 907.58s]  I've got another solution here. When we know we're going up against a telepath, just think of the
[907.58s -> 912.78s]  worst diarrhea you've ever had in your life. Everybody at the same time. When we're charging
[912.78s -> 916.94s]  into fight, just think of the time you shit your pants and you sprayed diarrhea all over your
[916.94s -> 921.42s]  fucking underwear and stuff and they would just see it and they'd fuck them up and then you get
[921.42s -> 933.62s]  them. It would work. Everyone has to do it though. We all have to do it. On the death counter.
[933.62s -> 936.98s]  Loyal followers of the king have nothing to fear. I don't even know. I don't like that.
[949.94s -> 953.94s]  Pocket the extra money knowing that shopkeepers in general tend to overcharge customers anyways.
[954.50s -> 958.58s]  Return to the store and give the shopkeeper his hard-earned money explaining to him the mistake.
[958.58s -> 962.10s]  Decide for the extra money to good use and purchase items that would help your family.
[963.14s -> 978.71s]  I don't know. What's where? What store are we at? Where are we? You're at Walmart.
[980.94s -> 992.41s]  I would probably say, hey, it depends on the store. It's a mom and pop general store. All right. If
[992.41s -> 996.57s]  it's a mom and pop general store, I'm going to be like, look, I think there's a mistake here.
[997.13s -> 1003.62s]  I'm not going to do that, right? I know while in a marketplace, you witness a thief cut a purse
[1003.62s -> 1008.74s]  from a noble. Even as he does so, the noble notices and calls for the city guards.
[1008.74s -> 1015.30s]  Marowark. In case to get away, the thief drops the purse near you. Surprisingly, no one seems
[1015.30s -> 1021.54s]  to notice the bag of coins at your feet. What do you do? Leave the bag there and knowing that it's
[1021.54s -> 1026.18s]  better not to get involved. Pick up the bag and signal to the guard knowing that the only honorable
[1026.18s -> 1030.50s]  thing to do is return the money to its rightful owner. Pick up the bag and pocket it knowing that
[1030.50s -> 1043.74s]  the extra windfall will help your family in times of trouble. I don't think I would get
[1043.74s -> 1049.75s]  involved in this. It's a noble. So what if I picked it up and brought it to the guards
[1050.31s -> 1056.87s]  and they go, there he is. That's the man that stole the noble's purse. I'm going to get
[1056.87s -> 1065.75s]  fucking destroyed. I don't know if I want to get involved in this. Oh, here, I found this. Yeah,
[1065.75s -> 1069.99s]  right, right? No, I'm not touching anything. Your father sends you on a task which you loathe,
[1070.07s -> 1075.51s]  cleaning the stables. On the way there, pitchfork in hand, you run into your friend from the
[1075.51s -> 1082.31s]  homestead near your own. He offers to do it for you in return for a future favor of his choosing.
[1082.95s -> 1089.50s]  Okay. What do you do? Accept the offer, reasoning that as long as the stables are cleared,
[1089.50s -> 1095.30s]  it matters not who does the cleaning. Decline the offer knowing that your father expects you to do
[1095.30s -> 1099.86s]  the work and it's better not to be in debt. Ask him to help you knowing that two people can do a
[1099.86s -> 1103.54s]  job faster than one and agree to help him with one task of his choosing in the future.
[1106.22s -> 1117.88s]  But what's the task? I think I would want to come help me do it because then whatever task...
[1119.83s -> 1137.11s]  Somebody said, what lame orc are you making? Okay, sorry, guys. There's me smash head with rock.
[1137.11s -> 1144.15s]  It's not on this list. It's only me split the difference with friend. What do you want me to
[1144.15s -> 1152.18s]  do here? No, two of us. Your mother asked you to help fix the stove. While you're working,
[1152.18s -> 1157.54s]  a very hot pipe slips its moorings and falls towards her. What do you do? Does that happen
[1157.54s -> 1164.26s]  to my mother? Position yourself between the pipe and your mother. Push your mother out of the way.
[1165.06s -> 1177.56s]  Grab the hot pipe. Hmm. I'm doing... Nope. I want option four. Excuse me. I want option four.
[1178.78s -> 1183.58s]  Put leg out, foot out and have whatever it is hit you in the top of the fucking shoe in a
[1183.58s -> 1187.96s]  matter how heavy it is, no matter what it is. It's foot out and it doesn't matter how bad it
[1187.96s -> 1198.78s]  hurts. This could be a phone. This could be a kitchen item. This could be anything. Foot out.
[1199.80s -> 1205.62s]  Catch your foot. Doesn't matter if it smashes. It doesn't matter. No, I'm not a knife. You don't?
[1205.62s -> 1211.58s]  No, no. I'm just saying like I do this with any item. I'm always the person that if they see
[1211.58s -> 1216.70s]  something about to fall, they go, oh, and they stick. I stick my right leg out to try to catch it
[1216.70s -> 1222.63s]  hacky sack style with the top of my shoe every time. But if it was an anvil,
[1222.63s -> 1228.63s]  I would still probably do it. This one. While in town, Baker gives you a sweet roll.
[1228.63s -> 1235.10s]  Delighted, you take it into an alley. Enjoy only to be intercepted by a gang of three other kids
[1235.10s -> 1240.46s]  your age. The leader demands... Wait, why are we kids? Or else he and his friends will beat you
[1240.46s -> 1248.04s]  and take it. But why are we children? Give the sweet roll without argument, knowing that later
[1248.04s -> 1251.72s]  this afternoon, you will have all your friends with you and you can come take whatever he owes
[1251.72s -> 1259.51s]  you. Act like you're going to give the sweet roll, but at the last minute, throw it in the air,
[1259.51s -> 1263.75s]  hoping that they'll pay attention to it long enough for you to get a shot in at the leader.
[1266.09s -> 1279.50s]  Drop the sweet roll and step on it, then get ready for the fight. Yeah, um, whereas lift up underarm
[1279.50s -> 1285.94s]  and wipe sweet roll all over armpit in a circular motion. They're not going to want it after that.
[1285.94s -> 1298.42s]  I'm not going to... I'm going to eat it in front of them. Where's eat it anyways?
[1302.04s -> 1307.82s]  Neither would you. I'd still eat it. It's my armpit. I'll do this one. Entering town,
[1307.82s -> 1312.86s]  you find that you are witness to a very well-dressed man running from a crowd.
[1313.42s -> 1322.70s]  He screams to you for help. The crowd behind him seems very angry. Neutral good orc. What is it all?
[1322.70s -> 1330.57s]  What orcs? What do you mean? I can't be a good orc? What are you talking about? Entering town,
[1330.57s -> 1333.77s]  you find that you are witness to a very well-dressed man running from a crowd. He
[1333.77s -> 1339.61s]  screams to you for help. The crowd behind him seems very angry. Stand aside and allow the man
[1339.61s -> 1345.64s]  and mob to pass, realizing that it is probably best not to get involved. Okay. Rush to the town's
[1345.64s -> 1350.12s]  aid immediately, despite your lack of knowledge of the circumstances. Rush to the man's aid
[1350.12s -> 1355.61s]  immediately, despite your lack of knowledge of the circumstances. Okay, here's what I'm going to do.
[1356.17s -> 1359.69s]  I'm going to get... I'm going to see him running. All right, he's running. There he goes. I'm going
[1359.69s -> 1364.17s]  to run to the crowd. First person, the person that's in the front of the crowd is going to
[1364.17s -> 1368.33s]  know the most information because they want that guy the most. Not the person that's two, three,
[1368.33s -> 1372.41s]  four, five, ten rows back. That person's just there because I guess I'm here, right?
[1372.41s -> 1376.17s]  Whoever's in the front of that line running the fastest to get this motherfucker, I'm going to be
[1376.17s -> 1379.77s]  like... I'm going to match speed and I'm going to be like, what do you do? What are we doing? What
[1379.77s -> 1394.17s]  do you do? What do you do? And then see what he says. This is very contextual. If they're like,
[1394.17s -> 1400.38s]  oh man, we're just like trying to get this guy and kick his ass for fun and shoving that guy,
[1400.38s -> 1405.58s]  right? Like I'm pushing that guy as hard as I can and then I'm going to turn and it's to be like,
[1405.58s -> 1416.86s]  who? Oh no, but then they'd be after me too. Whatever. Your personality and past reflect
[1416.86s -> 1423.69s]  a rogue. Okay. Very good. The letter that proceeded, you mentioned you were born under a certain
[1423.69s -> 1452.95s]  sign. There's too many of these. Which one of these is good? Which one of these is good?
[1455.27s -> 1479.99s]  Pick steed. Okay. Interesting. That is correct. Yes, I think. You now have a stat menu. Right
[1479.99s -> 1483.99s]  clicking allows you to use your menus when you are done with them. Show your papers to the captain
[1483.99s -> 1493.94s]  when you exit to get your release fee. Read your papers by pressing space bar. Get yourself a
[1493.94s -> 1500.98s]  suitable outfit unless you don't mind being mistaken for a slave or a pauper. Okay. Select
[1500.98s -> 1519.91s]  skill to train. What? Sneak? I don't get it. Where do I go? I can't breathe this. Hold on.
[1519.91s -> 1552.49s]  Is there like a make the UI bigger? Can anybody help me? Lower the resolution. Oh my God. That's
[1552.49s -> 1569.94s]  horrible. This is so bad. Oh, I think I crashed it. Can you guys see? Is it? It's fucked up.
[1569.94s -> 1580.44s]  It's fucked up. My whole computer is locked up. Come on, dude. Really? Pick it up. Thank you. All
[1580.44s -> 1587.40s]  right. Take the death counter off. That joke was funny for five minutes. Mouse. Hello. Where's my
[1587.40s -> 1600.76s]  mouse? Okay. Let's just go. This is going to be hard to read, but whatever. You'll go no further
[1600.76s -> 1612.94s]  until you have your papers. How do I take stuff? For release by Emperor Uriel Septim, the 567th
[1612.94s -> 1620.30s]  decree to the district of Vvardenfell of the province of Morrowind. Name Morrowind. Race orc
[1620.38s -> 1639.58s]  class rogue. Signed. Okay. Cool. Take it. Oh my goodness. I can't even see my health. That's how
[1639.58s -> 1646.76s]  small my fucking health bar is with this resolution. I'm not going to even know if I take damage. Fix
[1646.76s -> 1660.92s]  the UI, dude. I don't, what do you want me to do? What happened? What are you doing? We'll let your
[1660.92s -> 1665.48s]  actions go for now, but once you release stuff like that, we'll get you arrested. I picked a
[1665.48s -> 1692.78s]  candle up on your desk. Everything is free in this room. Every single object in this room is free.
[1693.58s -> 1699.42s]  Stolen for the last time. You've made your last mistake.
[1707.37s -> 1715.08s]  What the fuck else is in here?
[1738.04s -> 1747.46s]  Can I sell this? Am I getting bad boy points?
[1747.54s -> 1749.94s]  You've made your last mistake, thief.
[1752.55s -> 1775.45s]  What else is in here? Can I take the rug? Okay. So what do I get? Where's all my stuff?
[1776.17s -> 1788.39s]  Where's all my stuff? I picked up everything. Wait, what? Did they take it? Oh, they took it all.
[1803.70s -> 1836.55s]  Stop. I'm trying to fucking get out of here. I don't even know what's in here. Oh, sick. How do
[1836.55s -> 1871.99s]  I put this on? How do I equip stuff? How do you equip stuff? Check the barrel. Get the ring inside.
[1871.99s -> 1879.38s]  Ring of healing. Okay. Take it all. You have a magic menu where you can see all your powers.
[1879.38s -> 1904.09s]  All right. Press R to ready active magic. What? How do I do this? Right click, drag it. Oh, there we
[1904.09s -> 1919.91s]  go. Okay. What does that do? Talk to the captain. Don't try persuasion on him. If you're not good
[1919.91s -> 1962.94s]  at it, he will start to dislike you. Oh, shit. Oh, that's not good. Okay. Well,
[1968.28s -> 1979.46s]  oh shit. All right. Well, I'm an orc rogue. I know. I know. I know. Orc rogue. I don't care.
[1980.26s -> 1991.82s]  Last night storm could open MW. We've reached Morrowind. I'm sure they'll let us go. Quiet
[1991.82s -> 2014.82s]  comes the gun. What did I do to the game? I can't move. I actually can't move. You better do what
[2014.82s -> 2019.70s]  they say. I don't know. This guy's on drugs, man. What are you guys? What are you guys doing down
[2019.70s -> 2029.21s]  here? You guys are snorting mushrooms down here. Can I leave? This is where you do what they come
[2029.85s -> 2041.22s]  with me. Okay, we're good. By the way, fucking shit that Dr. Manhattan did to you. I'm not a fan
[2041.22s -> 2072.22s]  either. Not a fan at the end of that movie. Hello. Hi. Good to see you. I'm here. Okay. I am
[2073.34s -> 2087.18s]  an orc and I look like this. Yes. Great. I'm sure you'll fit right in. Follow me up to the office
[2087.18s -> 2098.10s]  and they'll finish your release. Why do I hear chewy? Okay, I know what I want to be. I don't
[2098.10s -> 2103.30s]  need to take all these questions again. Don't steal anything. We've been expecting you. You'll
[2103.30s -> 2108.10s]  have to be recorded before you're officially released. There are a few ways we can do this
[2108.10s -> 2117.35s]  and the choice is yours. Okay, I would like to pick a class from the list. I was what was I?
[2118.38s -> 2128.23s]  All these are cool. I don't want to be something else. I want to be a pilgrim.
[2128.87s -> 2140.86s]  Should just be a knight be a thief. Okay. Very good. Merry Christmas. I was like, wow,
[2140.86s -> 2151.48s]  he's in Merry Christmas. And what would and it was the steed. Okay. Interesting. All right. Goodbye.
[2152.92s -> 2161.66s]  Make sure this information is correct. Looks good to me. Thank you. See you later.
[2161.66s -> 2164.70s]  Show your papers to the captain when you exit to get your release speed.
[2167.10s -> 2173.82s]  Captain, let's go. See you later. Continue through and talk to Salas Gravius.
[2174.62s -> 2181.45s]  Pretty good Star Wars. Luke Skywalker is looking at something music.
[2182.33s -> 2192.18s]  You should learn how to do combat. Pick up the dagger on the table and activate it by space bar.
[2197.90s -> 2214.28s]  Wait, that was wrong. How do I use it? Okay, press F to pull out your weapon.
[2215.43s -> 2218.71s]  Once your weapon is ready to hold and release the left mouse button to swing it the harder you
[2218.71s -> 2242.94s]  swing it. Okay. I can't how do I save the game? F5. I can't save the game right now. You get a map.
[2242.94s -> 2256.26s]  Okay, cool. Check the barrel to get the ring. Yep. Very cool. I've got my magic item. All right.
[2256.26s -> 2274.12s]  Nice. Talk to the captain. Hi. Okay, release. Nobody can read this. So whatever. Morrowind.
[2274.60s -> 2279.27s]  You're in Morrowind. I don't know why you're here. Why you were released from prison and shipped
[2279.27s -> 2286.63s]  here. But your authorization comes directly from Emperor Rul's symptom, the seventh himself,
[2286.63s -> 2292.54s]  and I don't need to know any more than that. All right. Okay. You are free, man. Before you go,
[2292.54s -> 2299.14s]  I have instructions on your duties. What are they? This package came with the news of your arrival.
[2299.14s -> 2307.06s]  You are to take it to Caius Cossades in the town of Balmora. Go to the south wall corner club
[2307.06s -> 2313.14s]  and ask for this. Yeah. Okay. We'll find them. Serve them as whatever. All right. All right.
[2313.14s -> 2322.68s]  Thanks. Report to Caius Cossades in Balmora. Balmora is north of Sidonine. The road passes
[2322.68s -> 2328.04s]  this village in this fort. So go for it. All right. I got it. You got it. Thank you for everything.
[2328.68s -> 2337.13s]  Yes. Bye. I feel like I'm fucking gerbil. How do I get out of my? How do I get out of here?
[2345.58s -> 2356.01s]  Save. I can't save the game. Press J to use your journal and review what you've been told. Okay.
[2363.18s -> 2390.47s]  I'm sure I don't know how to. Sorry, stranger. I'm training. Shut up. All right. So we got to go
[2391.99s -> 2420.60s]  north. Wait, it said check out the trade house. Save. I just did. I saved it already. Popular
[2420.60s -> 2428.76s]  scrolls. Um, what's the popular scroll? I don't care. I honestly don't care. I suppose it is my
[2428.76s -> 2444.14s]  duty to help those less fortunate than myself recover some gold. That's right. See, I had a
[2444.14s -> 2449.42s]  bad run of luck playing nine holes and lost a bit of money. Normally I'd be fine. We can usually
[2449.42s -> 2452.94s]  keep some gold in our pockets just from the money the locals pay us for protection.
[2452.94s -> 2455.34s]  But now some of them are holding out on me, especially that little
[2456.79s -> 2463.22s]  Fetcher Fargoth. He's come up light the last couple of weeks and have shaken them down.
[2463.22s -> 2467.14s]  I know he's stashing it somewhere. I'd like you to find Fargoth's hiding place.
[2468.92s -> 2474.94s]  Okay. Yeah, sure. I'm not sure where he goes, but I know he wanders around town at night.
[2474.94s -> 2479.10s]  Watch his movements. The best vantage point is on top of the lighthouse south of town. That will
[2479.10s -> 2483.82s]  give you the nice view of all of this town. Keep an eye on where he goes. Figure out where he's
[2483.82s -> 2494.54s]  hiding that gold. All right. We got a quest. I will listen outlander, but make it quick.
[2503.67s -> 2508.01s]  All right, let's go. So go to the lighthouse south of town.
[2508.73s -> 2528.17s]  All right. Is that the lighthouse? Can you swim in more wind? What the fuck is that thing?
[2544.47s -> 2549.22s]  Look at that. How do I pick it up?
[2566.47s -> 2569.83s]  Just be the dumbest shit you could ever see. Somebody in the town.
[2570.71s -> 2574.31s]  Um, how do I pick them up? Can I eat this? Can I pick it up or something? How do I pick it up?
[2574.95s -> 2582.49s]  How do I pick this up? You don't have anything.
[2588.20s -> 2594.82s]  All right. Where's the lighthouse? Bro, I can't even jump in this game.
[2619.19s -> 2643.59s]  Yep. How do I eat it? This is gross. Should I not be? That seriously is the Star Wars sound.
[2643.59s -> 2651.72s]  All right. Where's the lighthouse? Is that the lighthouse here? That's definitely it.
[2653.05s -> 2666.15s]  Press E to jump. Why would E if you jump? Okay, so I'm going to go up here at night. Wait,
[2666.15s -> 2678.18s]  can I take this stuff? Never mind. Um, you got any little secrets? Buy from merchants and traders
[2678.18s -> 2685.77s]  who like you. You get better prices. Okay. Well, of course they treat me better. I'm going to
[2685.77s -> 2697.03s]  sneeze in his face. No, I'm not. Okay. We're good. No, he's just a yard. That was weird. That was
[2697.03s -> 2704.87s]  weird. That was fucking weird. Whatever. All right. Anybody up here? I can eat this bread.
[2705.51s -> 2717.24s]  Is this illegal? This is illegal. That's illegal, but whatever. No one can see me, right? That's
[2717.24s -> 2728.63s]  illegal, but I can have it. All right. Well, can I just sleep on the ground? I should have cooked
[2728.63s -> 2750.62s]  the crab meat in here. I'm an idiot. What? What's happening? What's going on? I'm literally stuck
[2750.62s -> 2768.20s]  on this. How do I sleep on the ground? T? I don't even know what this guy looks like. Is that him?
[2768.76s -> 2790.44s]  I don't even know what this guy looks like. What's this guy look like? That's definitely him right
[2790.44s -> 2845.98s]  there. Is it a binoculars? That's definitely him right there. He doesn't have a torch anymore.
[2845.98s -> 2860.78s]  Is that where he's putting the money? That's where he's putting the money. Okay. I know where he's
[2860.78s -> 2893.02s]  putting he put the money in the ocean. Okay. All right. I'm going. Got it. Hell yeah. That's a lot
[2893.02s -> 2907.56s]  of money. I'm not going to bring it back. Heal yourself with the ring. How do I open up the,
[2907.56s -> 2913.38s]  how do I use magic? Honestly, I would probably bring it back. I just don't know where that guy
[2913.38s -> 2932.66s]  even is far. I don't even know where that guy was. So it's in the shop. Oh, okay. He's here.
[2932.66s -> 2945.02s]  Buy some stuff. All right. What do you got? Barter? Oh, dude, I have so much money now.
[2945.02s -> 2956.33s]  I'm a thief, right? So could I get like a cool dagger? Shake a fork? Oh, pants. Wait, okay.
[2956.33s -> 2985.13s]  Armor, iron greaves, iron arrow. What should I get? Why am I yawning? What the heck? I don't know why
[2985.13s -> 2999.43s]  I'm yawning. I've never yawned on stream before. It's a boring, boring game. I actually have been
[2999.43s -> 3007.88s]  having fun. Okay. Iron dagger. There we go. That's the one I'm going to take. Iron dagger. Let's go.
[3007.88s -> 3029.94s]  Where is it? Did I buy it? Um, also I'm going to get, Oh, I already had one of these. Oops.
[3029.94s -> 3062.39s]  Maybe like a short sword. What about spear? What's a tanto? No, I want to put them on.
[3063.03s -> 3099.42s]  I want to equip them. How do I? I can't fucking see anything, man. Offer? Okay. Do I have any
[3099.42s -> 3153.67s]  other clothes? I need pants. I'm going to get a sword. Sure. Iron sword. Buy it. There we go.
[3154.23s -> 3178.39s]  I need a helmet too. Do not start a new fucking game, man. I need a helmet. I don't want to talk
[3178.39s -> 3193.27s]  to you. All right. You're supposed to find the hiding place. Did you find it? You found the
[3193.27s -> 3198.90s]  hiding place? That's great. Where's the gold? You're trying to hold out on me, Orc? You found his
[3198.90s -> 3211.00s]  hiding place? That's great. Where's the gold? You're trying to hold out on me, Orc? Um, I'm going to
[3211.00s -> 3232.70s]  bribe him 100 gold. I hear you, Orc rogue. You're welcome. See? All right. What do you got? Services.
[3232.70s -> 3245.77s]  Dump? What? What? All right. I need some, I need some quests. Put me on a quest. Do you have anything
[3245.77s -> 3253.54s]  in a specific place or a quest? Oh no, I gotta go north. All right. See you guys later.
[3256.38s -> 3282.98s]  Balmora. That's right. Bring out the windows magnifying glass. All right. North. What the fuck
[3282.98s -> 3315.62s]  do these signs say? Oh, this way. I'm a caravaner. I can transmit you to this place. Nah. Yeah. It's
[3315.62s -> 3337.48s]  so dark. I can't see anything. Can I turn the gamma up? That doesn't do anything. Oh, what's this?
[3337.48s -> 3376.52s]  Yeah, I'll take it. Am I going the right way? Mushrooms. Oh, change the time. Oh shit. A rat.
[3386.84s -> 3416.33s]  Can hurt rat meat. Yep. This way. How could you do that? I don't know. I'm so blown out now.
[3416.89s -> 3440.36s]  Look at me. I'm super blown out. I'm blown out right now. That's better. What does it look? Why
[3440.36s -> 3461.08s]  does it look? This looks weird, doesn't it? I'm blown out. Why is the FPS so shitty? I don't get
[3461.08s -> 3485.91s]  it. Whatever. I tried. I asked a random dude if they liked watching you. They asked you what's
[3485.91s -> 3520.10s]  a good anime? Um, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. What is that? Is that friendly? Is this thing asleep?
[3520.10s -> 3544.98s]  Can I talk to it? This thing is sleeping. Can you can I ride it? That's cute. I like that thing.
[3544.98s -> 3575.86s]  Okay, I lost track of where I was going. I think it's this way. That monster is bored. No, no,
[3575.86s -> 3601.10s]  this way. Wait, something over here at adventure awaits us. What's over here? Random adventure
[3601.10s -> 3663.38s]  awaits in Morrowind. How do you quick? How do you look? What the fuck? What happened to me?
[3664.58s -> 3675.66s]  What happened? Did I walk into the fire? What? I don't understand what happened. I'm definitely
[3675.66s -> 3680.60s]  this too high for me, but whatever. I can probably get the kill. Let's go. Fuck it.
[3680.60s -> 3705.99s]  How the fuck are you supposed to do this? What class am I? I don't piano player,
[3705.99s -> 3710.79s]  whatever it is. Bored. I don't even know. What am I? I got a better idea.
[3712.68s -> 3717.69s]  You are taking up the in top. How is your body taking up the entire tunnel?
[3718.33s -> 3753.13s]  That is how how do I heal our right? I don't fucking care. Adventure awaits on the road.
[3753.13s -> 3761.69s]  This game is 80 years old today. Wait, I can use my other knife. I have another knife.
[3761.69s -> 3788.63s]  I can't use that. Oh, Balmora. Oh, a citizen. Is there anything I can do for you to help?
[3788.63s -> 3796.44s]  How are you? There's a bandit nearby. Yes, I was just walking along here, minding my own business.
[3796.44s -> 3802.52s]  Suddenly a bandit jumped at me from behind. He was a dark elf, a strong dashing dark elf.
[3802.52s -> 3807.40s]  He didn't harm me in any way, although he did take my jewels. He was quite gentle and he talked
[3807.40s -> 3818.79s]  me for a while. What? What is going on? Oh, never mind the jewels. I just want to find that bandit
[3818.79s -> 3826.55s]  again. He was charming and funny, and I simply must see him again. His name, Nellos, Nellos
[3826.55s -> 3831.67s]  Anmar, a name that will stay on my lips for eternity. Perhaps you can find him. Please,
[3831.67s -> 3835.91s]  I cannot live without knowing if you could ever love me. I have nothing to offer you in return,
[3835.91s -> 3852.58s]  but could you not help me for the sake of love? Sure. Okay, I'm sure you'll be able to find him.
[3852.58s -> 3857.22s]  He mentioned something about having to head north, so I imagine he might be found in
[3858.44s -> 3864.28s]  Peligaiad. Please, find and give him this glove for me as a token of my love. I'm certain he will
[3864.28s -> 3878.25s]  want to find me again. Okay, can I keep the jewels? All right, so Peligaiad. See you later.
[3899.03s -> 3901.75s]  What? What? Oh shit, she's a fucking wizard.
[3922.71s -> 3930.36s]  Oh, no, no, no. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What the fuck?
[3931.58s -> 3950.58s]  What the fuck? I thought I had this... I'm supposed to be a thief.
[3954.97s -> 3965.67s]  Now you have to flee. I don't have to flee, do I? What the hell is going on with this door?
[3966.57s -> 3974.28s]  What the fuck is this? Did I just let out like the demon bug? Oh my god, it's coming out of me.
[3976.38s -> 3984.39s]  What the... What is behind that door? That's way... That music is way too heroic for
[3985.03s -> 3993.00s]  what's in here. Do you understand? That was like a nice... That wasn't scary demon music.
[3993.00s -> 4017.75s]  Am I even hitting this? Dude, I'm gonna prove to everybody how cool I am. I'm gonna kill this
[4017.75s -> 4049.59s]  thing. Holy shit, I just killed... I look what I just did. So what was in here? What? It's an electric
[4049.59s -> 4060.68s]  fence? Why is there an electric fence in here? What are you talking about? That took me so long
[4060.68s -> 4086.66s]  to die too. That was an actor. What are you gonna do about it? Huh? What are you gonna do about it?
[4086.66s -> 4092.49s]  You're gonna open that door? That trap door? Come on. Why don't you open it? Open it. Open the door.
[4093.30s -> 4102.73s]  Come on. Open the door. Holy shit. You guys are fucking... You guys are fucking idiots. I can
[4102.73s -> 4131.10s]  literally just... I can just jump over this. What a shitty door. Can we talk? Open the door. Why won't
[4131.10s -> 4143.58s]  you talk? Open the door. Open it. Coward. Open the door, coward. Open the door, coward.
[4152.73s -> 4169.00s]  Oh my god. I can get over there. I don't know how to heal. I... Is it R? R doesn't do anything.
[4169.00s -> 4178.86s]  Look. Restore health. How come I can't do it? R. F. Equip the ring. It is equipped, isn't it?
[4179.58s -> 4192.81s]  Press T to heal out of combat from enemies. You got bottom right corner on the menu.
[4194.52s -> 4216.25s]  Guys, I can't see that. It's... Wait. Magic. The menu. Guys, I can't see... Okay, I have to look at
[4216.25s -> 4225.37s]  LBS because I literally can't see from here down. It's cut off on my monitor. Where is it? How do I
[4225.37s -> 4240.71s]  press it? I can't even see that either. It's cut off from here down. How do I do it though? Not that
[4240.71s -> 4260.55s]  one. I don't get it. Down the map. The other menu. Oh, this one? Oh, okay. All right. All right. I
[4260.55s -> 4291.66s]  got it. Why am I... Why am I sounding like a fucking animal? Oh my god. I'm dying. Fuck this place.
[4316.10s -> 4329.69s]  This sounds like Heroes of Might and Magic and one of like the town menus. Does this have... Wait,
[4329.69s -> 4350.01s]  I have some stuff. I get... This is 60 bucks? Put a ring? Can I put a ring on?
[4355.96s -> 4371.11s]  Um, I can't even... I can't read this. Oh, right. Let me heal.
[4374.25s -> 4383.11s]  Where's my head? What's berserk? Oh, different spell. Oh, cool. All right.
[4386.33s -> 4417.96s]  Let's go. Oh, fucking pop in. I need to... I don't have a sign. Okay. This way.
[4417.96s -> 4439.51s]  Yeah, you don't have that on you. Whatever. Itchy armpit.
[4441.27s -> 4475.48s]  Okay. This way. Oh, do you have robot legs? I don't know. No, this way. Did I make it? What's in
[4475.48s -> 4493.21s]  here? Wait. Do I have to go that way to... Oh, wait. I killed that lady. Never mind. Still... But hold
[4493.21s -> 4506.26s]  on. But what is over here? I'm curious. I want to see what's in here. What's this about? Hello? Uh,
[4506.26s -> 4535.06s]  any rumors? Okay. What do you got in here? Wooden door. Wooden door. Prison tower. Wait, can I
[4535.06s -> 4554.33s]  release prisoners? This is a really weird prison. Um, what the fuck did I come all the way up here
[4554.33s -> 4598.78s]  for? Nice view. Yeah. Can I do anything here? It's just a fort? Um, persuasion. Um, admire.
[4598.78s -> 4606.06s]  You notice... Oh, yes. Orc rogue. It's true. Okay. A weapon or something. Maybe.
[4606.86s -> 4616.07s]  What can I do here? The back of your shirt looks like a face. It does. Oh, okay. Here we go. What
[4616.07s -> 4624.89s]  do you want? Training. Are you a member? No, then my services are not for you. What do you do? I'm
[4624.89s -> 4630.73s]  a master at arms. I'm a master of all the basic hand weapon types. Willing to train with weapons
[4630.73s -> 4646.34s]  for a fee. So let me in. Frozen North sounds awful to me. Any rumors? Something. You like to dance
[4646.42s -> 4656.15s]  close to the fire, don't you? Do you got potions? I'm a trader. All right. So let's do. What do you
[4656.15s -> 4668.20s]  got? Iron club. Oh, steel throwing star. Very cool. Oh, I can sell you some stuff here. You want
[4668.20s -> 4685.37s]  this? That's worth 60 bucks. This is worth a lot of money. I mean, I'm not getting good value for
[4685.37s -> 4705.40s]  this. Did I just get bad value? No, I'm good. Okay. All right. What about... Oh, he's not cool.
[4706.20s -> 4726.41s]  Get rid of these shoes. Oh, I got but one shoulder pad. Why do you sell? You don't someone pairs?
[4726.41s -> 4751.08s]  That's weird. There we go. Okay, nice. Goodbye. Can I sleep down here? Wait, long blade block.
[4751.64s -> 4769.70s]  Medium armor. Do I have a long blade? Your webcam is fucked. Oh my god. What the hell? It really is.
