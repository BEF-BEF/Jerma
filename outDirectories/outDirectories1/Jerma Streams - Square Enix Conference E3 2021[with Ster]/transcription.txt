[3.32s -> 4.60s]  What are you, what are you doing?
[4.60s -> 7.48s]  I was explaining my theories on being a furry.
[7.48s -> 8.84s]  No, I don't.
[8.84s -> 12.68s]  And I was, I was just saying out loud that you would not want to hear this.
[12.68s -> 15.48s]  Just like, okay, if you, listen, if you guys want to, if you guys want to hear
[15.48s -> 20.33s]  Ster go off on his, on his takes or whatever, or whatever we have to say about whatever.
[20.33s -> 22.97s]  Yeah, he's, he's got a stream that you can watch like,
[22.97s -> 25.80s]  when I'm not on it, so I can run the fuck away from him.
[25.80s -> 31.18s]  Yeah, no, I, I respect your, how, uh, how much of a prude you are,
[31.18s -> 35.50s]  that you are not evolving with the times that you're stuck back in the 80s.
[35.50s -> 40.17s]  And, you know, the world is becoming more and more woke.
[40.17s -> 44.18s]  And you just can't accept that some people have.
[44.18s -> 50.34s]  He's, oh, he's, well, he's muted again. He's, he's been muted again.
[50.34s -> 56.76s]  All right, so he's back. So, um.
[56.76s -> 59.64s]  Yeah, so no, I wasn't reminded. So you were a cat boy.
[59.64s -> 63.18s]  So I was talking about furries. You were a cat boy.
[63.18s -> 64.71s]  What are you talking about?
[65.85s -> 70.52s]  My chat keeps telling me because I, okay, long story.
[70.52s -> 75.16s]  I'm doing a cosplay trade with another streamer who is a VTuber who is a cat girl.
[75.16s -> 77.54s]  So I'm going to become a cat girl.
[77.54s -> 79.70s]  And my chat, every time this gets brought up is like,
[79.70s -> 81.86s]  oh, he's going to do it before German does it.
[81.86s -> 85.14s]  But ever since your, your hot tub stream,
[85.14s -> 88.34s]  they've been saying that you beat me to the punch.
[88.34s -> 88.90s]  I did.
[88.90s -> 91.13s]  But you were just denying it.
[91.13s -> 93.61s]  When I asked you if you were a cat boy, you said no.
[93.61s -> 95.93s]  I didn't do a hot tub stream.
[95.93s -> 99.99s]  I see what's happening here.
[99.99s -> 102.10s]  What are you talking about?
[102.10s -> 104.82s]  When Bugleberry, did Bugleberry become a cat boy?
[104.82s -> 107.27s]  Of course, of course I remember that, yeah.
[107.27s -> 112.09s]  Okay, I see.
[112.09s -> 115.62s]  You have like such a profound amount of shame within you
[115.62s -> 120.18s]  that I think one day the cap's going to burst and the pride is just going to fall out.
[120.98s -> 121.70s]  What are you doing?
[124.14s -> 127.82s]  He's got to put on a fucking mask of an old guy to get in the hot tub.
[127.82s -> 129.02s]  Like just live a little, man.
[134.82s -> 136.42s]  Time for some stretches.
[138.81s -> 143.24s]  Hey, if you want to be able to do some stretches, you got to start now.
[143.24s -> 144.04s]  All right.
[144.04s -> 147.59s]  So can we talk about video game conference stuff?
[147.59s -> 148.23s]  Absolutely.
[148.23s -> 151.11s]  If you would like to talk about what you enjoyed from the first day,
[151.11s -> 153.03s]  because that's the day that we've both seen.
[153.03s -> 153.51s]  Okay.
[153.51s -> 154.15s]  Elden Ring.
[154.15s -> 155.03s]  That would be fine.
[155.03s -> 155.99s]  Elden Ring.
[155.99s -> 159.98s]  I want to hear, I really do want to hear, and I really mean this.
[159.98s -> 161.51s]  Stop muting him.
[161.51s -> 163.30s]  I'm not.
[163.30s -> 166.12s]  Stop muting him.
[166.12s -> 171.77s]  So I want to hear what you have to say about Elden Ring,
[171.77s -> 176.15s]  because you, correct me if I'm wrong, you did not like Sekiro.
[176.15s -> 178.95s]  I think Sekiro was the worst Souls-like.
[178.95s -> 179.27s]  Okay.
[179.91s -> 181.53s]  I don't.
[181.53s -> 182.25s]  Not by much.
[182.25s -> 186.41s]  I think it's still a good game, but I think it was the worst in the series of Souls-likes.
[186.41s -> 186.91s]  Okay.
[188.86s -> 191.02s]  Which without context, people are mad.
[191.02s -> 195.22s]  I don't like that they made you have to grind healing potions.
[195.22s -> 195.94s]  Why?
[195.94s -> 197.40s]  They did that in Bloodborne.
[197.40s -> 201.13s]  Bloodborne had that.
[201.13s -> 205.75s]  Oh, I'm remembering it being a lot worse than Sekiro.
[205.75s -> 208.70s]  And honestly, it's been so long since I played it.
[208.70s -> 210.46s]  I don't want to unpack this.
[210.46s -> 214.14s]  Look, they're all Dark Souls games, and they're all great games.
[214.14s -> 215.34s]  There's no opinion other than,
[216.06s -> 217.18s]  I saw Elden Ring.
[217.18s -> 219.64s]  It looked cool.
[219.64s -> 221.91s]  I signed me up.
[221.91s -> 226.26s]  Do you think it's going to be like a Dark Souls game,
[226.26s -> 227.94s]  or do you think it's going to be more like Sekiro?
[227.94s -> 232.49s]  Do you think they're going to go back to, it's Dark Souls, but not really?
[234.28s -> 238.09s]  I think it's going to be just another Dark Souls game,
[238.09s -> 243.50s]  with the twist that you can get on a horse, so a little bit added to it.
[243.50s -> 245.46s]  But it's like the same thing.
[245.46s -> 247.22s]  Oh, Arise, Tarnished.
[247.22s -> 249.38s]  Oh, you changed the word that you call it.
[249.38s -> 250.50s]  They're not Hollows.
[250.50s -> 251.62s]  They're Tarnished now.
[251.62s -> 253.72s]  It's just Dark Souls.
[253.72s -> 255.00s]  Yeah, but all right.
[255.00s -> 256.04s]  People that keep saying that.
[256.04s -> 257.56s]  They brought on, what's his name?
[257.56s -> 261.16s]  What's the guy that the Game of Fire and Thrones?
[261.16s -> 264.76s]  They brought him on, and he just did, what's the hotkey?
[265.64s -> 268.94s]  In the program I use, it's Ctrl-H for Find and Replace.
[268.94s -> 271.18s]  And he just did Find, Replace, Hollow, Tarnished.
[271.18s -> 274.46s]  And he did a whole bunch of words, Replaces.
[274.46s -> 276.46s]  And then they were like, okay, let's go.
[278.54s -> 280.14s]  You don't know what the story is yet.
[282.76s -> 284.36s]  Sure, it could be just, oh, the Tarnished.
[284.36s -> 286.36s]  But you don't know what's going on yet.
[286.36s -> 287.72s]  It could be something cool.
[287.72s -> 290.68s]  I know that the trailer showed like, oh, you're in a hub world.
[290.68s -> 294.28s]  And here's like the soft-voiced girl with a hood on.
[294.28s -> 298.23s]  And she's the one that lets you level up.
[298.23s -> 298.79s]  Yeah, but okay.
[300.76s -> 304.60s]  I've been willing to give From Software a shitload of leeway.
[304.60s -> 307.93s]  And tons of room to just, oh, they've done that before.
[307.93s -> 311.54s]  The Dark Souls and the Souls-like games that they have made
[311.54s -> 313.70s]  are so fucking fun.
[313.78s -> 318.94s]  And they're so good that I want like more of that.
[319.91s -> 320.79s]  I don't want less of that.
[320.79s -> 321.75s]  I want more of that.
[321.75s -> 325.03s]  Again, I'm not disagreeing that I expect it to be a very good game
[325.03s -> 327.98s]  and I'm going to play it and enjoy it a lot.
[327.98s -> 332.62s]  But you're asking for opinions and saying that it's going to be a great game
[332.62s -> 336.06s]  is really just a very boring conversation if we keep going back and forth on this.
[336.06s -> 339.26s]  So let me bring you way back to The Binding of Isaac
[339.26s -> 341.58s]  when you used to have the joke that you would say all the time,
[341.58s -> 343.10s]  it's the same game, Ed.
[343.96s -> 349.30s]  Why don't you say it's the same game, Miyazaki?
[349.30s -> 354.17s]  Because, well, there's two reasons why.
[354.17s -> 359.29s]  Because I really wanted...
[359.29s -> 362.15s]  Well, we'll break this down even further.
[362.15s -> 369.11s]  So The Binding of Isaac was so unlike anything, right?
[369.11s -> 371.83s]  And I loved playing it so much.
[371.83s -> 373.19s]  It was like, I have probably...
[373.19s -> 373.67s]  I probably have...
[373.67s -> 374.39s]  He's struggling.
[374.39s -> 374.95s]  It's quiet.
[374.95s -> 376.68s]  I'm working on it.
[376.68s -> 377.88s]  I have probably...
[377.88s -> 381.32s]  I read a comment that was like, did these guys hate each other?
[381.32s -> 382.36s]  I don't like having him on.
[382.36s -> 384.36s]  He challenges me and I don't like it.
[384.92s -> 385.80s]  Okay, so...
[385.80s -> 387.96s]  I enjoy a divisive conversation.
[387.96s -> 389.16s]  That's too challenging.
[389.16s -> 389.80s]  You got to give me like...
[389.80s -> 391.40s]  Give me like softball question.
[391.40s -> 391.64s]  Okay.
[391.64s -> 393.08s]  Give me softball question.
[393.08s -> 395.64s]  Do you think that Miyazaki is...
[395.64s -> 399.00s]  Give me like a what's your favorite fucking like...
[399.00s -> 401.48s]  What's your favorite drink like whiskey?
[401.48s -> 404.12s]  You know, that's very easy.
[404.12s -> 406.60s]  The guy's name that did Death Stranding?
[408.02s -> 409.13s]  Kojima.
[409.13s -> 410.25s]  Kojima, yeah.
[410.25s -> 411.85s]  Kojima had an interview on the first day.
[411.85s -> 412.57s]  Did you see that?
[415.03s -> 417.43s]  That's my highlight of E3 is his interview.
[417.43s -> 418.39s]  The first part that I...
[418.39s -> 419.91s]  I'm not going to go on about the first part,
[419.91s -> 424.63s]  but he actually said if aliens came to Earth the way things have been,
[424.63s -> 426.87s]  you would not be excited by that,
[426.87s -> 429.43s]  but you will be excited by my next game.
[429.43s -> 434.78s]  This dude's crazy.
[434.78s -> 439.42s]  So wait, he's saying that his new game is going to be more interesting
[439.42s -> 441.26s]  than if aliens invaded Earth.
[441.26s -> 442.06s]  Yeah, and I don't...
[442.06s -> 445.26s]  He said he brought up 9-11 for some reason
[445.26s -> 448.89s]  and the guy threw him the softball questions like,
[448.89s -> 450.33s]  oh, hey, Kojima, how's it going?
[450.33s -> 451.37s]  Hope you've been having fun.
[451.37s -> 453.05s]  He's like, we're in a state of emergency.
[453.05s -> 455.46s]  It's like 9-11-2 over here.
[455.46s -> 456.74s]  It was really weird.
[456.74s -> 457.70s]  Really? I didn't even see it.
[457.70s -> 462.87s]  And then he said that aliens were less interesting than the games he make.
[462.87s -> 464.31s]  Anyway, as you were saying,
[464.31s -> 468.06s]  you were defending your position on the binding of Isaac.
[468.06s -> 469.02s]  No, okay.
[469.02s -> 469.90s]  So I didn't see that.
[470.46s -> 471.42s]  That's weird.
[471.42s -> 471.66s]  Okay.
[471.66s -> 474.14s]  I kind of want to rewatch it to make sure I didn't mishear it
[474.14s -> 475.26s]  and that I'm not misquoting
[475.26s -> 480.06s]  because these are pretty wild allegations I'm throwing out
[480.06s -> 481.66s]  for the public statement he made.
[481.66s -> 486.90s]  Well, anyways, I have probably the same amount of time
[486.90s -> 489.80s]  in Binding of Isaac that I did in...
[490.62s -> 491.66s]  It's probably pretty close.
[491.66s -> 494.46s]  It's probably my second or third most played game on Steam.
[494.46s -> 495.58s]  It's close to TF2.
[495.58s -> 499.69s]  It's like, if not more than 500 hours, it's close.
[499.69s -> 503.42s]  And I have played Binding of Isaac across multiple devices.
[503.42s -> 507.34s]  We're talking, I've played it probably two or 300 hours on the Switch.
[507.34s -> 509.66s]  I played it like two or 300 hours on PC.
[509.66s -> 512.86s]  I played like two or 300 hours on like PlayStation.
[512.86s -> 517.50s]  I just kept, I kept taking, I kept redoing save files
[517.50s -> 519.82s]  because I would play it for like 200 hours and I would delete it.
[519.82s -> 521.34s]  I would just uninstall it from Steam
[521.34s -> 522.94s]  or uninstall the game from like Switch.
[522.94s -> 525.74s]  So I would constantly start over
[525.74s -> 529.66s]  and I have like probably a thousand hours total in the game.
[529.66s -> 535.27s]  So there was a lot of stuff that I wanted in the game.
[535.27s -> 538.71s]  And when I kept saying, oh, same game, Ed.
[538.71s -> 541.51s]  That was just like a joke to say
[541.51s -> 543.27s]  because there was silence in the chat room
[543.27s -> 544.47s]  when we would be in like vent.
[545.03s -> 546.63s]  It didn't even mean anything.
[546.63s -> 549.11s]  I'm noticing a trend with silence for you.
[549.11s -> 550.87s]  It didn't even mean anything.
[550.87s -> 552.07s]  Dude, you're talking about somebody
[552.07s -> 555.91s]  that literally walked around saying Thanos lines
[555.91s -> 557.19s]  into the shower and shit after.
[557.99s -> 559.35s]  I just say words.
[559.35s -> 560.47s]  They don't even mean anything.
[560.47s -> 563.62s]  Okay, does it feel good to get this out?
[563.62s -> 568.50s]  I'm not getting anything out.
[568.50s -> 568.98s]  He vented.
[568.98s -> 570.66s]  You guys don't, people don't even vent.
[573.08s -> 574.04s]  Is that, are we old?
[574.60s -> 575.32s]  That's not that old.
[575.32s -> 581.38s]  That's not that long ago.
[581.38s -> 584.58s]  So how does this relate to, it was just a joke back then.
[584.58s -> 587.22s]  And that's why you don't say it's the same game Miyazaki.
[587.22s -> 588.34s]  That's what we're getting at.
[588.34s -> 590.36s]  Well, because I like it.
[590.36s -> 592.12s]  I like, it's the stuff that I like.
[592.12s -> 593.96s]  And when you get more of the stuff that you like.
[593.96s -> 596.68s]  Okay, so I have a great direction to take this.
[596.68s -> 599.16s]  What was your favorite Souls like?
[599.16s -> 602.38s]  Bloodborne, without a doubt.
[602.38s -> 606.26s]  Okay, actually that totally, I agree.
[606.26s -> 609.46s]  That kind of takes away the point I was gonna make.
[609.46s -> 610.10s]  Because you know what?
[610.10s -> 613.70s]  Bloodborne, actually like one of the best games ever made.
[613.70s -> 615.62s]  If Bloodborne was 60 FPS,
[615.62s -> 617.94s]  it would be the best game that's ever been made.
[618.02s -> 618.90s]  Second best.
[618.90s -> 622.01s]  What's better?
[622.01s -> 623.05s]  I don't know.
[623.05s -> 625.18s]  Diablo 2?
[625.18s -> 631.30s]  Um, like a true, okay, if they read kind of,
[631.30s -> 634.26s]  and I don't even want to use the word remaster, because.
[634.26s -> 636.02s]  I don't think they're worth comparing, actually.
[636.02s -> 636.50s]  I just.
[636.50s -> 637.78s]  Okay, if they, okay, if they was a,
[637.78s -> 640.63s]  you know how the PS4 Pro came out?
[640.63s -> 642.87s]  And hold on, like the gas is coming up here
[642.87s -> 644.87s]  and it's hard to not, okay.
[645.99s -> 649.05s]  So don't do that shit.
[649.05s -> 651.22s]  So, because you just freaked me out.
[651.22s -> 651.86s]  Okay.
[651.86s -> 654.94s]  So when, you just threw me off.
[654.94s -> 655.74s]  What was I even saying?
[657.78s -> 658.66s]  Fuck, it's gone.
[658.66s -> 661.62s]  It just went, you just, a hole came out of my head.
[661.62s -> 664.34s]  Well, we were talking about an incident in your childhood.
[664.34s -> 665.54s]  You said it disturbed you greatly.
[665.54s -> 666.42s]  So listen.
[666.42s -> 670.25s]  So when the PS4 Pro came out, I remember being like,
[670.25s -> 672.81s]  I'm going to get, I'm gonna get a PS4 Pro.
[674.26s -> 677.22s]  I can't wait because they're definitely going to put
[677.22s -> 679.06s]  Bloodborne on it and have it be 60 FPS.
[679.06s -> 681.61s]  I was like, that's the reason why the console is coming out.
[681.61s -> 683.06s]  And they just, they didn't do it.
[683.06s -> 684.18s]  So I was like, what?
[685.45s -> 689.29s]  And then PS5 has like the PS5 mode for a lot of games.
[689.29s -> 690.09s]  PS4 games, right?
[690.09s -> 692.26s]  And I'm like, this is it.
[692.26s -> 693.06s]  They got to do that.
[693.06s -> 693.62s]  Like, come on.
[693.62s -> 697.46s]  It's, I don't know if it's so baked into the game's code
[697.46s -> 698.66s]  or something that they can't do it.
[698.66s -> 700.10s]  Because remember the Dark Souls shit
[700.10s -> 706.30s]  where if you made it 60 FPS, like they went like 100% faster.
[706.30s -> 707.98s]  Just give me that.
[707.98s -> 709.66s]  Give me like a 60 FPS Bloodborne.
[709.66s -> 711.91s]  And I would, oh, I would play it again.
[711.91s -> 713.69s]  I would.
[713.69s -> 715.61s]  Bloodborne 2 or something.
[715.61s -> 719.88s]  I don't know that I would really even, it's just a good game.
[721.24s -> 724.22s]  The atmosphere, everything about that game.
[724.22s -> 727.90s]  To like the art style, the atmosphere, the story,
[727.90s -> 730.14s]  the gameplay, the trick weapons.
[730.14s -> 732.39s]  It's like, I hope.
[732.39s -> 735.43s]  Look, if Elden Ring even has a 10th of that kind of stuff.
[736.73s -> 737.61s]  I want just trick weapons.
[737.61s -> 739.93s]  The trick, no, they need to do that again.
[739.93s -> 742.84s]  Trick weapons were the coolest thing of any game
[742.84s -> 744.94s]  that's a single player game that can come out in a long time.
[744.94s -> 749.14s]  Having the two weapons you can switch between are amazing.
[749.14s -> 751.86s]  It was so much fun to be able to transition between the two.
[751.86s -> 752.34s]  You know what I mean?
[752.34s -> 756.52s]  Like you go like one, two, big load, L1, slash.
[756.52s -> 757.08s]  And then you had two.
[757.08s -> 758.44s]  And then there's like two guys coming at you over here.
[758.44s -> 760.20s]  You slash with the big two-hander.
[760.20s -> 761.00s]  I loved that.
[761.00s -> 763.88s]  It was the best thing that I've ever seen in a single player game.
[763.88s -> 767.74s]  What are trick weapons?
[767.74s -> 769.26s]  I'm just in agreement.
[769.26s -> 771.02s]  I don't have a, I don't have a counterpoint.
[771.02s -> 774.86s]  Bloodborne, when Bloodborne came out, everybody was like,
[774.86s -> 777.18s]  oh, hold on, there's only like 20 weapons in the game?
[777.18s -> 777.90s]  What the fuck?
[777.90s -> 780.47s]  That's, but every weapon is like two weapons.
[780.47s -> 782.87s]  So each weapon has like a different mode, essentially.
[782.87s -> 784.81s]  There's two modes for each weapon.
[784.81s -> 787.85s]  I think when Bloodborne came out for about a full year,
[787.85s -> 791.21s]  you would just randomly say like quotes from it too.
[791.21s -> 795.75s]  Like Amigdala, you just say that randomly all the time.
[795.75s -> 796.94s]  Yeah.
[796.94s -> 800.30s]  You're really asking the guy why he's going, oh, same game, Ed.
[800.30s -> 801.61s]  It doesn't mean anything.
[801.61s -> 802.73s]  I'm just saying words.
[802.73s -> 804.46s]  Okay.
[804.46s -> 808.41s]  So how do I know what you're saying now has any meaning?
[808.41s -> 812.81s]  Because you were quite, there's a lot of conviction in your words.
[812.81s -> 814.57s]  You should know this more than anybody.
[814.57s -> 823.93s]  That when 24 hours go by, the last day, I don't remember half the things I've ever said.
[823.93s -> 826.49s]  People will like bring up stuff like, hey, dude, remember when you said this?
[826.49s -> 828.09s]  Like, oh, remember on that stream?
[828.09s -> 828.89s]  I'm like, what the fuck?
[828.89s -> 830.01s]  What are you talking about?
[830.01s -> 833.08s]  Why does everybody want me to do Aaron?
[833.08s -> 836.66s]  Why is everybody saying Aaron?
[836.66s -> 839.51s]  Aaron, why?
[839.51s -> 840.87s]  Well, can you do Aaron?
[840.87s -> 841.35s]  Aaron?
[841.35s -> 844.14s]  Yeah.
[844.14s -> 844.70s]  Okay.
[844.70s -> 847.90s]  Wait, have you seen, have you seen, have you seen Snack on Titan?
[847.90s -> 848.22s]  Yes.
[848.22s -> 848.78s]  Okay.
[848.78s -> 849.26s]  Are you ready?
[849.26s -> 850.62s]  I've not seen the newest season.
[850.62s -> 851.10s]  Aaron?
[851.10s -> 851.26s]  Yeah.
[851.26s -> 851.66s]  Aaron?
[851.66s -> 853.18s]  Okay, no, Aaron?
[853.18s -> 855.46s]  Right?
[855.46s -> 857.46s]  I, are we talking like a dub here?
[857.46s -> 860.90s]  No, like, you don't, you didn't watch the dub?
[860.90s -> 861.46s]  No.
[861.46s -> 863.82s]  Oh, well, then you don't get it.
[863.82s -> 864.70s]  I'm sorry.
[866.63s -> 867.11s]  You don't get it.
[867.11s -> 867.27s]  Okay.
[867.27s -> 867.91s]  Whatever.
[867.91s -> 868.79s]  I don't, I'm sorry.
[868.79s -> 869.83s]  I don't get it.
[869.83s -> 870.87s]  Well, I tried.
[870.87s -> 874.71s]  And now I do remember it was been a long time since the early seasons, but I do remember
[874.71s -> 878.60s]  that girl really did like to say Aaron while crying.
[878.60s -> 881.24s]  So I, I can piece the things together.
[881.24s -> 887.62s]  Dura says Jerma is unfunny.
[887.62s -> 888.58s]  When did he say that?
[888.58s -> 891.34s]  Did he?
[891.34s -> 892.38s]  You say that all the time.
[893.50s -> 895.26s]  You say that I'm not funny?
[895.26s -> 897.10s]  Wait, no, you know, you say that I'm not funny.
[897.10s -> 897.58s]  No, I don't.
[897.58s -> 898.22s]  I say that you're very funny.
[898.22s -> 899.50s]  I'm always on the defensive.
[899.50s -> 900.86s]  You're always trying to mute me.
[901.42s -> 907.02s]  I have said on this broadcast that I think that you're one of the funniest like YouTubers.
[907.02s -> 908.98s]  I've said that.
[908.98s -> 910.18s]  I've seriously said that.
[910.18s -> 910.58s]  Tell them.
[910.58s -> 910.90s]  Okay.
[910.90s -> 913.38s]  I'm laughing because of the qualifier.
[913.38s -> 924.92s]  Jerma, Jerma, you're one of the funniest influencers I watch.
[924.92s -> 925.80s]  I don't like that word.
[927.11s -> 928.15s]  Well, you know what?
[928.15s -> 930.95s]  Of all of the influencers, you're probably the funniest.
[935.42s -> 936.30s]  Make sure to check out Star.
[937.48s -> 942.02s]  Wait, who's the other guy?
[943.78s -> 944.74s]  Trow's channel.
[944.74s -> 945.54s]  He's streaming right now.
[946.95s -> 949.62s]  Yeah, don't, you know, you don't come over here.
[949.62s -> 950.58s]  I got to warn you though.
[950.58s -> 953.54s]  Like if you're like a new viewer and you go over to his channel,
[954.66s -> 956.18s]  he's going to say something you're probably going to be like,
[956.18s -> 957.06s]  this guy sucks.
[957.06s -> 960.50s]  Like he's going to say he's going to have a take on something.
[960.50s -> 962.58s]  I'm like a gorilla song.
[962.58s -> 969.54s]  You got to listen to it like five times before you see where it's coming from.
[969.54s -> 972.02s]  Currently running Myriad, right?
[972.02s -> 973.38s]  Or not right now?
[973.38s -> 978.66s]  Well, no, I am like developing a replacement for D&D because D&D sucks.
[978.66s -> 982.58s]  While it's simultaneously the best game, it's also not good enough anymore.
[982.58s -> 984.58s]  So I've been trying to make my own D&D.
[984.58s -> 987.70s]  It's coming along quite well and I'm hoping to start running games again
[987.70s -> 990.26s]  in a few months, two or three months.
[990.26s -> 995.03s]  But with that last comment, I think 60 to 70% of everyone that would have come over
[995.03s -> 996.39s]  probably just decided they weren't.
[997.85s -> 1000.17s]  Well, I mean, if you want me to back up the things I say,
[1000.17s -> 1001.45s]  I can back them up.
[1001.45s -> 1002.49s]  We were talking about this again.
[1002.49s -> 1004.82s]  You've got four and a half minutes in my head.
[1004.82s -> 1005.62s]  Four and a half minutes.
[1005.62s -> 1008.42s]  Why D&D sucks?
[1008.42s -> 1008.82s]  Okay.
[1008.82s -> 1010.58s]  You have the floor.
[1010.58s -> 1011.22s]  I have the floor.
[1011.22s -> 1015.10s]  I'm going to explain one mechanic in Dungeons & Dragons.
[1015.10s -> 1021.18s]  When you cast a spell on an enemy, when you are attacking an enemy with a spell
[1021.18s -> 1024.22s]  and they are defending against and they need to roll a saving throw,
[1024.22s -> 1028.46s]  they are actually attacking your spell with their defense.
[1028.46s -> 1032.70s]  And that's very significant to note because when you're attacking a spell save,
[1033.34s -> 1046.60s]  you then a tie win.
[1046.60s -> 1051.37s]  And I yield the rest of my time to the speaker.
[1051.37s -> 1058.49s]  So, you're making what you would call, in your own words, a better version of D&D.
[1058.49s -> 1059.77s]  Well, my-
[1059.77s -> 1062.09s]  Or a more refined version of D&D.
[1062.09s -> 1062.97s]  Is that what you're saying?
[1062.97s -> 1064.09s]  The more precise way to look at it.
[1064.09s -> 1064.97s]  This is an interview now for you.
[1064.97s -> 1066.41s]  This is like a me interview.
[1066.41s -> 1067.45s]  Thank you for interviewing me.
[1067.45s -> 1069.77s]  I know you're really excited about the Myriad coming soon.
[1070.41s -> 1076.81s]  The important part is that most people play D&D on the internet, like Roll20 and stuff.
[1076.81s -> 1079.45s]  But D&D is not made to be played on a computer
[1079.45s -> 1081.85s]  that can calculate things more than a person can.
[1081.85s -> 1087.42s]  So, I'm trying to make something that utilizes the fact that you're on a computer to begin with
[1087.42s -> 1090.95s]  and then make combat more interesting and have a lot more things auto-generate.
[1092.31s -> 1094.71s]  Have you guys heard of the best game Diablo 2
[1094.71s -> 1097.50s]  that automatically rolls loot for you and stuff?
[1097.50s -> 1099.05s]  Yeah, it's got all that.
[1099.05s -> 1099.93s]  Oh, what?
[1099.93s -> 1100.49s]  That's cool.
[1100.49s -> 1102.01s]  Yeah, like Diablo 2.
[1102.01s -> 1104.65s]  Now that it's like that thing you've heard of, I get it.
[1106.78s -> 1111.16s]  We probably should open the stream because here comes the conference.
[1111.16s -> 1112.20s]  Square Enix, right?
[1112.20s -> 1114.66s]  Oh, shit.
[1114.66s -> 1118.39s]  Wow, 40 minutes went by actually pretty quick.
[1118.47s -> 1119.19s]  He muted you.
[1121.62s -> 1125.54s]  Not really, only a small amount, like only just a little bit.
[1125.54s -> 1128.60s]  All right, so this is, we gotta get this back up.
[1128.60s -> 1135.58s]  What's for dinner?
[1135.58s -> 1138.30s]  Switch, the Switch gaming one's the one, yeah, that's the one.
[1138.30s -> 1148.49s]  All right, so what else are we working on here?
[1148.49s -> 1149.69s]  Brand risk stir?
[1152.49s -> 1156.81s]  I did legitimately prepare like 20 questions for an interview for you.
[1156.81s -> 1160.73s]  So, if we really need to kill time, I can just start asking things.
[1160.73s -> 1164.89s]  No, it's starting in like two minutes.
[1164.89s -> 1170.76s]  Um, what's a good one here?
[1170.76s -> 1174.68s]  All right, so they're at, okay, yeah, we're almost there.
[1175.66s -> 1179.50s]  I actually looked up some videos of like worst all-time interview questions,
[1179.50s -> 1180.46s]  so this is a real one.
[1180.46s -> 1182.14s]  They're funnier when you know they're real.
[1182.14s -> 1182.54s]  Okay.
[1182.54s -> 1184.78s]  All people are prejudiced.
[1184.78s -> 1186.38s]  All people are prejudiced.
[1186.38s -> 1187.74s]  Which prejudice do you have?
[1190.02s -> 1191.14s]  Probably against not liking you.
[1193.24s -> 1194.36s]  All right, so let's open it up.
[1194.36s -> 1198.44s]  Eric Hobbs.
[1200.22s -> 1203.46s]  Aaron, ready to do it?
[1203.46s -> 1205.48s]  Are you ready?
[1205.48s -> 1207.08s]  Yeah, I have it open.
[1207.08s -> 1209.70s]  All right, so wait, refresh it.
[1209.70s -> 1212.28s]  Let's make sure we're on the same thing here.
[1212.28s -> 1214.95s]  Like I just refreshed it, like right now.
[1214.95s -> 1215.75s]  Uh, refresh.
[1217.59s -> 1220.07s]  I'm on a bright white screen.
[1220.63s -> 1222.73s]  It's the schedule, right?
[1222.73s -> 1225.21s]  And it is the schedule, and it should be starting in one minute.
[1225.21s -> 1226.25s]  It's starting in one minute.
[1226.25s -> 1227.45s]  We got Square Enix.
[1227.45s -> 1229.88s]  And by the way, I am going to start muting him
[1229.88s -> 1233.14s]  because he's been talking over too many cutscenes.
[1233.14s -> 1234.18s]  How come I don't hear anything, though?
[1235.08s -> 1235.58s]  Okay.
[1236.68s -> 1237.56s]  Let's listen to these guys.
[1240.28s -> 1241.24s]  This looks like comfy.
[1241.24s -> 1242.20s]  This looks like comfortable.
[1245.56s -> 1246.76s]  I want to sit in one of those chairs.
[1248.82s -> 1249.62s]  All right, Square Enix.
[1249.62s -> 1250.66s]  What are those robots?
[1250.66s -> 1251.46s]  What's going on?
[1251.46s -> 1252.26s]  What is this?
[1252.26s -> 1252.82s]  What is that?
[1255.29s -> 1255.85s]  What was that?
[1255.85s -> 1257.05s]  That was, what the hell was that?
[1257.77s -> 1267.11s]  Those, those were like, those are robots.
[1267.11s -> 1267.91s]  But what were they doing?
[1270.58s -> 1271.94s]  The people are controlling them.
[1280.14s -> 1282.54s]  Oh, I put, wait, I put a lot of creamer in this coffee.
[1283.10s -> 1284.78s]  And I didn't stir it because I want to get back up here.
[1286.94s -> 1289.34s]  No, and it's, I just got to this part
[1289.34s -> 1290.54s]  where all the creamer is.
[1290.54s -> 1292.30s]  And I'm just drinking essentially warm cream.
[1293.10s -> 1294.73s]  It's all right.
[1295.59s -> 1297.99s]  Oh, you're allowed to talk about the warm cream you're drinking.
[1297.99s -> 1299.75s]  And I can't say when I was in elementary school,
[1299.75s -> 1301.67s]  I could bend to my, to my face on the ground.
[1310.66s -> 1312.90s]  Kind of a one-sided relationship here.
[1312.90s -> 1318.42s]  I feel like you're in the chat right now.
[1318.42s -> 1320.66s]  Like when you close your eyes at night,
[1320.66s -> 1323.14s]  you don't just like have chat scrolling.
[1323.14s -> 1324.98s]  No, this is like, like you close your eyes.
[1324.98s -> 1328.74s]  I want, I want the remainder of this conference
[1328.74s -> 1332.18s]  to be us describing video game material.
[1332.18s -> 1333.06s]  I don't want to hear,
[1333.06s -> 1334.98s]  I don't want to hear about you bending over.
[1334.98s -> 1336.42s]  I don't want to hear about you talking about
[1336.90s -> 1337.46s]  creams.
[1337.46s -> 1338.74s]  I don't want you talking about.
[1338.74s -> 1341.38s]  And I want, I want video game discussions.
[1341.94s -> 1342.66s]  Nothing else.
[1342.66s -> 1344.42s]  I don't want to hear about you bending over anymore.
[1345.14s -> 1346.26s]  No more game.
[1346.26s -> 1347.62s]  So far game of the year.
[1347.62s -> 1349.14s]  Germa 2021.
[1349.14s -> 1351.78s]  Uh, the only one I played, which is Resident Evil 8
[1351.78s -> 1353.86s]  is the only game I've played so far that's come out in 2021.
[1355.94s -> 1357.22s]  Oh, okay.
[1357.22s -> 1360.52s]  That's a lot to choose from.
[1361.64s -> 1363.00s]  What have you played this year?
[1363.00s -> 1367.43s]  What about the power washer?
[1367.43s -> 1368.63s]  Yeah, that was pretty good.
[1368.63s -> 1371.45s]  I don't even know.
[1373.26s -> 1376.33s]  I'm in that Lost Ark technical alpha.
[1376.33s -> 1376.81s]  Oh shit.
[1376.81s -> 1377.93s]  Are you really?
[1377.93s -> 1379.82s]  Yeah, pretty good.
[1381.61s -> 1384.25s]  That's like seven years in the making, apparently,
[1384.25s -> 1385.13s]  or five, whatever it is.
[1385.69s -> 1387.29s]  Well, I mean, it's been made, just not,
[1387.29s -> 1388.25s]  it wasn't made for us.
[1390.10s -> 1391.22s]  Guilty gear?
[1391.22s -> 1391.94s]  I don't like it.
[1391.94s -> 1392.58s]  All right, here we go.
[1392.58s -> 1393.14s]  Quiet.
[1393.14s -> 1403.00s]  Good afternoon, everyone.
[1403.00s -> 1404.20s]  It's Matt Mercer here,
[1404.20s -> 1406.92s]  and I'm back as your host of Square Enix Presents.
[1407.48s -> 1410.84s]  Today, we have a special E3 edition of the show for you
[1410.84s -> 1413.08s]  with new game announcements, updates,
[1413.08s -> 1415.72s]  and exciting news from our studios across the globe.
[1416.28s -> 1418.28s]  So let's kick off with the world premiere
[1418.28s -> 1420.76s]  of a brand new game from Eidos, Montreal.
[1421.56s -> 1422.92s]  We hope you enjoy the show.
[1424.04s -> 1433.03s]  I am so proud of you.
[1433.67s -> 1437.61s]  Do you know what a birthright is, Peter?
[1438.25s -> 1439.94s]  Is this Starfield again?
[1439.94s -> 1442.52s]  Or is it just another space game?
[1442.52s -> 1443.48s]  This is not supposed to be talking.
[1443.48s -> 1444.92s]  All the space games look the same.
[1444.92s -> 1445.80s]  Stop talking.
[1445.80s -> 1446.28s]  It looks the same.
[1446.28s -> 1446.92s]  It's Marvel.
[1446.92s -> 1447.72s]  On your side.
[1448.84s -> 1453.10s]  News of the galaxy?
[1453.10s -> 1453.82s]  Rocket.
[1453.82s -> 1457.72s]  So I let Groot fill out the paper.
[1457.72s -> 1460.36s]  Space games are fine if they're Marvel.
[1461.08s -> 1464.54s]  So we got to be 6,900.
[1464.54s -> 1469.21s]  Need a plan.
[1469.85s -> 1478.23s]  Crystal Dynamics didn't make this one, right?
[1478.23s -> 1479.03s]  We got this.
[1479.03s -> 1497.93s]  Put your pants on.
[1497.93s -> 1507.14s]  Push him off tracks.
[1507.14s -> 1510.25s]  Make your main questions here, right?
[1510.25s -> 1511.69s]  Maybe we can work something out.
[1511.69s -> 1512.19s]  Get him.
[1513.45s -> 1515.05s]  You had one job, Quill.
[1515.05s -> 1516.41s]  I did exactly what?
[1517.61s -> 1521.45s]  The more no killing teammates.
[1521.45s -> 1522.09s]  Says who?
[1522.09s -> 1523.77s]  It's literally in your contract.
[1523.77s -> 1525.45s]  I made no such commitments.
[1526.97s -> 1529.77s]  In less than three cycles, all would be lost.
[1529.85s -> 1532.49s]  The galaxy cannot be saved either, Quill.
[1532.49s -> 1534.17s]  We could do this together.
[1549.83s -> 1551.51s]  Licensed music has been replaced.
[1552.63s -> 1553.43s]  Good.
[1553.43s -> 1554.63s]  It means we don't have to worry about it.
[1555.35s -> 1565.30s]  What's the actual song that's supposed to be there?
[1565.94s -> 1579.26s]  Hi, my name's Olivier Poul, senior producer here at Eidos Montreal.
[1579.26s -> 1583.02s]  For the past few years, we've had the privilege to work on our version
[1583.02s -> 1586.14s]  of Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy and reimagine it.
[1586.14s -> 1587.02s]  Okay, react.
[1587.34s -> 1588.30s]  He's just talking about it.
[1588.30s -> 1588.94s]  React.
[1588.94s -> 1589.44s]  Now.
[1593.74s -> 1594.24s]  Faster.
[1594.78s -> 1595.58s]  You don't have much time.
[1597.18s -> 1597.98s]  I would give that a...
[1599.98s -> 1600.48s]  I don't know.
[1601.42s -> 1602.94s]  Game reviewers say blah.
[1602.94s -> 1603.66s]  8 out of 10.
[1603.66s -> 1606.46s]  It was a game that looks like it's gonna...
[1606.46s -> 1607.50s]  Fans are gonna think it's cool.
[1607.66s -> 1613.11s]  Join us on this journey and you'll hear more about the game from our team behind this project.
[1613.11s -> 1613.99s]  All right, let's do this.
[1617.08s -> 1619.08s]  He's trying to find something nice to say.
[1619.08s -> 1622.28s]  I don't have anything to say because it was just like a trailer that had like...
[1623.24s -> 1625.40s]  They had like the song of the Hedgehog music playing.
[1625.40s -> 1627.40s]  And they were just shooting monsters and it was like,
[1627.40s -> 1628.52s]  look at these characters you like.
[1628.52s -> 1629.48s]  I don't know.
[1629.48s -> 1630.68s]  I don't know what it is.
[1630.68s -> 1632.92s]  Characters from Marvel's past.
[1632.92s -> 1637.00s]  You can't watch a trailer and go, wow, that game sucks.
[1637.00s -> 1638.44s]  I think it's a piece of shit.
[1638.44s -> 1639.16s]  I don't even know what it is.
[1639.72s -> 1640.22s]  You can.
[1641.08s -> 1641.72s]  You can't.
[1641.72s -> 1642.92s]  I don't even know what it is though.
[1642.92s -> 1644.04s]  Like I don't know.
[1644.04s -> 1645.00s]  It's just like a video game.
[1647.88s -> 1648.76s]  You're right about that.
[1648.76s -> 1649.64s]  It is a video game.
[1651.24s -> 1652.04s]  Does it look good?
[1653.32s -> 1653.80s]  I don't know.
[1654.68s -> 1658.84s]  You know, I felt as someone who isn't really a fan of the Guardians of the Galaxy,
[1658.84s -> 1663.40s]  I felt as though the vibes that it put off were quite authentic to the series
[1663.40s -> 1666.84s]  and really captured exactly what the movies were all about.
[1666.84s -> 1670.36s]  It's probably going to make you really feel like you are Star-Lord.
[1672.20s -> 1672.84s]  Well, all right.
[1674.60s -> 1677.72s]  I'm not, I haven't really seen, I'm not a big Guardians fan, okay?
[1678.76s -> 1681.72s]  I don't, I didn't, I thought the movies were cool,
[1681.72s -> 1682.44s]  but I didn't really get it.
[1682.44s -> 1684.68s]  I'm like, oh, I don't like love Guardians of the Galaxy.
[1684.68s -> 1685.56s]  It was like, cool.
[1688.60s -> 1690.12s]  It's not that I thought it was, they were bad.
[1690.12s -> 1692.44s]  I just, pretty much all the Marvel stuff.
[1692.44s -> 1694.52s]  I love Spider-Man, okay?
[1694.52s -> 1695.02s]  Okay.
[1697.88s -> 1699.16s]  That's my barometer.
[1699.16s -> 1703.16s]  Like Homecoming, Far From Home, like those Spider-Man movies are my barometer.
[1703.96s -> 1706.92s]  And like, I don't put Guardians higher than Spider-Man Homecoming.
[1707.96s -> 1708.46s]  Okay.
[1709.16s -> 1712.92s]  So your reaction to the Guardians of the Galaxy game is, I love Spider-Man.
[1715.48s -> 1717.64s]  Star-Lord is really empowering.
[1717.64s -> 1719.72s]  He's very agile on the battlefield.
[1719.72s -> 1720.68s]  He can slide.
[1720.68s -> 1724.12s]  I hate to say it, but that's actually my reaction to every game.
[1725.08s -> 1727.88s]  It's just, oh, Guardians of the Galaxy, yeah, I love Diablo 2.
[1727.88s -> 1731.08s]  You're doing the same thing, but you're not getting shit on for it.
[1735.72s -> 1737.24s]  Or I don't like it, okay?
[1737.24s -> 1740.20s]  I don't think this game looks, it's not for me.
[1740.20s -> 1741.08s]  I don't, I don't know.
[1741.08s -> 1742.04s]  Maybe it is though.
[1742.04s -> 1742.84s]  I don't know.
[1742.84s -> 1747.48s]  They've shown like a guy going like this, like a belly of an alien.
[1747.48s -> 1749.00s]  I don't know what the video game is.
[1749.00s -> 1749.72s]  It could be great.
[1750.36s -> 1752.12s]  I need more time to process it.
[1754.76s -> 1759.16s]  And no, I'm going to defend myself here, because yes, there's a reason why.
[1760.36s -> 1763.24s]  I said that I, yes, it's Guardians of the Galaxy.
[1763.24s -> 1767.32s]  I like Spider-Man, because if this was a Spider-Man game, I'd be like, oh, yup.
[1768.28s -> 1771.96s]  But it's, I put, in Marvel, I put Spider-Man over Guardians.
[1771.96s -> 1772.52s]  You understand?
[1772.52s -> 1773.08s]  That's what I mean.
[1775.08s -> 1775.58s]  Okay.
[1776.04s -> 1777.08s]  Is that relevant?
[1777.08s -> 1778.44s]  Yes, because it's a Marvel game.
[1778.44s -> 1779.48s]  It's the same universe.
[1780.28s -> 1785.08s]  That's like saying that like if Diablo had another game in the same universe,
[1785.08s -> 1788.68s]  that was the different characters, and you liked those characters more
[1788.68s -> 1790.92s]  than like Deckard Kane, which, excuse me.
[1792.20s -> 1792.84s]  Why would you say that?
[1793.48s -> 1794.36s]  But that's my point.
[1794.36s -> 1798.28s]  Like if it's different, it's the same universe, but different characters.
[1803.16s -> 1806.60s]  I am more interested in a Spider-Man game than a Guardians game.
[1806.60s -> 1807.24s]  That's my point.
[1807.24s -> 1807.74s]  That's it.
[1809.64s -> 1810.68s]  In a Guardians game.
[1811.24s -> 1811.56s]  Okay.
[1811.56s -> 1814.60s]  And I'm more interested in Diablo 2 than I am a Guardians game.
[1814.60s -> 1816.68s]  Oh, but then you can't, but all right, that's fine.
[1816.68s -> 1818.28s]  But like they're not in the same universe.
[1821.51s -> 1826.79s]  Honestly, the Marvel universe is so just like, oh my god, I gotta get rid of everything.
[1827.43s -> 1830.41s]  So who's to say it's not in the universe?
[1830.41s -> 1836.23s]  What's going on?
[1836.23s -> 1837.83s]  I feel like I'm in the, I'm playing the game.
[1840.09s -> 1841.29s]  Yeah, it was weird.
[1842.01s -> 1842.73s]  Let's play.
[1842.73s -> 1843.69s]  I was not prepared for that.
[1843.69s -> 1844.57s]  Oh, should it be playing?
[1845.53s -> 1847.29s]  All right, here we go.
[1847.29s -> 1847.79s]  All right.
[1852.89s -> 1856.65s]  We appear to be 6,963 units short.
[1856.65s -> 1858.49s]  We intend to keep our ship, Peter Quill.
[1858.49s -> 1859.13s]  I know.
[1859.13s -> 1859.69s]  I know.
[1859.69s -> 1862.01s]  We clearly need a plan.
[1862.01s -> 1863.37s]  Are these the characters from the movie?
[1863.37s -> 1863.87s]  What?
[1864.86s -> 1865.36s]  No.
[1866.46s -> 1867.50s]  I mean, they're the characters.
[1868.70s -> 1872.30s]  They are the characters as portrayed by other people.
[1872.30s -> 1875.02s]  My figurines are not knickknacks.
[1875.02s -> 1875.52s]  Is it?
[1877.42s -> 1878.22s]  I mean, I see Groot.
[1878.22s -> 1880.46s]  I will sacrifice your head.
[1880.46s -> 1883.34s]  And take us to the majestic mountains of Kakarantara.
[1883.34s -> 1888.86s]  Guys, I think we should hear out Groot for once.
[1889.98s -> 1892.34s]  I am.
[1892.34s -> 1899.24s]  Now, the only problem with your plan is that Lady Hellbender only buys monsters,
[1899.24s -> 1901.32s]  and you are not a monster.
[1901.32s -> 1903.40s]  Groot, are you really offering to-
[1903.40s -> 1906.92s]  No, no, he is not offering that, okay?
[1906.92s -> 1907.88s]  It could work.
[1907.88s -> 1910.60s]  So Groot, I guess we could bust him out after.
[1910.60s -> 1911.10s]  Absurd.
[1912.36s -> 1915.42s]  Lady Hellbender seeks the monster with him.
[1915.74s -> 1918.06s]  The small ugly one is clearly the correct choice.
[1918.70s -> 1922.22s]  He's cruel, sadistic, and his soul is filthy and filled with rage.
[1922.22s -> 1923.18s]  I vote we sell Groot.
[1923.18s -> 1923.68s]  Yeah?
[1923.68s -> 1925.90s]  I honestly think Lady Hellbender will go for it.
[1925.90s -> 1926.70s]  Yeah, well-
[1926.70s -> 1928.62s]  Yeah, this is the first 10 minutes of the game.
[1928.62s -> 1930.54s]  I also vote for the creepy little beasts.
[1931.34s -> 1932.06s]  Two votes each.
[1932.86s -> 1933.36s]  Peter?
[1937.16s -> 1938.12s]  But is this-
[1938.12s -> 1941.00s]  Well, Rocket's definitely scarier on the inside.
[1941.00s -> 1944.04s]  He's unstable and vicious and totally oblivious to the needs of us.
[1944.04s -> 1945.56s]  Are we still into dialogue trees?
[1945.56s -> 1946.28s]  I feel like that's-
[1946.28s -> 1947.08s]  All right, let's do this.
[1947.08s -> 1947.56s]  That's gone.
[1947.56s -> 1948.68s]  Let's go sell a monster.
[1949.64s -> 1951.72s]  But I think everyone learned that they don't change anything.
[1953.72s -> 1956.52s]  Because you're going to sell either one of those two characters,
[1957.08s -> 1958.20s]  arrive in the level,
[1958.20s -> 1959.80s]  and then they're going to jump through a wall and say,
[1959.80s -> 1960.30s]  I was here.
[1995.77s -> 1996.57s]  It's not Spider-Man.
[1996.57s -> 1997.07s]  No, it's not.
[2000.01s -> 2000.51s]  True?
[2005.30s -> 2007.70s]  I honestly think the dialogue, as much as I'm-
[2009.06s -> 2009.94s]  It's not for me.
[2012.28s -> 2014.68s]  They're doing a good job, like, delivered well.
[2017.02s -> 2018.54s]  I mean, it's going to be-
[2019.34s -> 2023.02s]  It's going to be like a licensed video game, right?
[2023.02s -> 2023.42s]  I don't know.
[2024.78s -> 2028.18s]  It's probably going to be 10 hours, 8 hours or something.
[2028.82s -> 2030.66s]  All your favorite characters are here.
[2030.66s -> 2033.78s]  Look, some people really do love this franchise, and that's fine.
[2033.78s -> 2034.74s]  And I hope you like it.
[2038.82s -> 2040.98s]  Okay, if this was Diablo II, right?
[2040.98s -> 2042.50s]  And like, imagine this perspective.
[2045.30s -> 2047.14s]  Imagine you're controlling the character here,
[2047.14s -> 2049.38s]  and this is a third-person perspective.
[2049.38s -> 2050.82s]  It's Diablo II and items fall down.
[2050.82s -> 2051.54s]  I'd be excited for it.
[2062.12s -> 2065.16s]  This is a really good indicator of what we're talking about.
[2065.16s -> 2066.84s]  What's your favorite movie?
[2067.99s -> 2068.87s]  My favorite movie?
[2068.87s -> 2069.51s]  What's your favorite movie?
[2069.51s -> 2070.63s]  What's your favorite movie?
[2070.63s -> 2071.99s]  There's so many movies.
[2071.99s -> 2073.19s]  You're putting me on the spot.
[2073.19s -> 2074.23s]  Whatever I pick.
[2074.23s -> 2075.27s]  What's like a top-
[2075.27s -> 2075.75s]  What's on your top 10?
[2075.75s -> 2078.79s]  I said my favorite movie was Coraline like 8 years ago,
[2078.79s -> 2079.83s]  and people quote me on that.
[2079.83s -> 2081.59s]  I don't think I can commit to this.
[2081.59s -> 2084.15s]  Okay, well, so you would put Coraline in your top 10?
[2084.15s -> 2085.03s]  No, I wouldn't.
[2085.03s -> 2087.03s]  That's why it hurts me.
[2087.03s -> 2088.79s]  So what's a movie that you think is in your top 10?
[2094.28s -> 2096.12s]  I'm going to go with the tried, the true, the classic.
[2096.12s -> 2097.88s]  You can't go wrong with Forrest Gump.
[2097.88s -> 2100.60s]  Like, I won't be upset by saying that.
[2100.60s -> 2101.10s]  Okay.
[2101.40s -> 2105.40s]  If they made a Forrest Gump video game that was nerd person,
[2105.40s -> 2106.20s]  would you play it?
[2106.20s -> 2107.72s]  If you could, like, play as Forrest Gump.
[2113.10s -> 2113.60s]  Never mind.
[2124.68s -> 2127.00s]  Yeah, like a top-down game where Forrest Gump is, like,
[2127.00s -> 2129.48s]  beating people up and, like, loops dropping, like, Diablo 2.
[2132.68s -> 2133.48s]  Yeah, I'd play that.
[2136.20s -> 2137.16s]  I concede, I would.
[2138.20s -> 2139.40s]  You would play that.
[2139.40s -> 2140.12s]  You would like it.
[2140.92s -> 2143.80s]  Gump Royale, last runner standing.
[2143.80s -> 2145.56s]  Yeah, you would play the shit out of that.
[2145.56s -> 2146.12s]  Are you kidding me?
[2150.74s -> 2151.56s]  I'd give it a try.
[2151.56s -> 2152.68s]  I'd try anything once.
[2152.68s -> 2153.88s]  I mean, if you can bend that far,
[2153.88s -> 2155.00s]  you're going to try anything once.
[2155.00s -> 2156.28s]  God, get out of here.
[2157.32s -> 2161.88s]  I have to have, like, a three-strike policy with you.
[2161.88s -> 2163.24s]  Like, when you cross two strikes,
[2163.24s -> 2164.92s]  I need to, like, send you a message to Discord
[2164.92s -> 2167.08s]  and be like, hey, you're on two strikes.
[2167.08s -> 2168.68s]  Do I get a cooldown?
[2168.68s -> 2169.18s]  No.
[2170.36s -> 2171.64s]  Okay, so are we on one strike?
[2171.64s -> 2174.12s]  No, you're on five strikes.
[2174.12s -> 2175.24s]  I'm reducing it back to two.
[2176.04s -> 2176.92s]  One more strike and you're out.
[2178.15s -> 2179.27s]  And I'm just going to have to be
[2182.74s -> 2184.98s]  the neutral planet from Futurama.
[2186.10s -> 2186.42s]  Yes.
[2186.42s -> 2187.46s]  That's me from now on.
[2190.65s -> 2192.82s]  This game looks complete.
[2196.28s -> 2198.44s]  Oh, look, okay, let's give them some credit
[2198.44s -> 2199.40s]  because they should get it.
[2200.04s -> 2203.56s]  They are showing this is the video game.
[2204.76s -> 2206.20s]  Okay, compare this to Avengers.
[2206.20s -> 2208.44s]  But this is not, like, rock music playing
[2208.44s -> 2210.36s]  and, like, a CGI cut scene of people,
[2210.36s -> 2212.04s]  like, holding their guns in the camera.
[2212.04s -> 2214.28s]  Like, this is the video game.
[2214.28s -> 2215.32s]  They're showing the game.
[2215.32s -> 2216.68s]  This is probably the first 10 minutes of the game.
[2217.32s -> 2218.44s]  That's all right.
[2218.44s -> 2219.88s]  They're doing that.
[2220.44s -> 2221.88s]  They should deserve a little bit of credit.
[2221.88s -> 2222.68s]  They should.
[2222.68s -> 2225.80s]  I also respect the bare minimum of presenting something.
[2227.02s -> 2228.14s]  Like, they're not, look,
[2228.14s -> 2229.74s]  there's a little bit of frame rate dropping.
[2229.74s -> 2232.38s]  Like, it's fine, but that's going to happen, right?
[2232.38s -> 2232.88s]  Ah.
[2233.66s -> 2235.27s]  This actually kind of looks fun.
[2235.27s -> 2236.55s]  Like, I don't hate this.
[2237.43s -> 2241.99s]  Although, like, I don't know about the character switching.
[2249.98s -> 2250.30s]  I don't know.
[2250.30s -> 2251.42s]  Maybe it would be fun for a little bit.
[2251.42s -> 2253.66s]  Look, if you're a fan of the game, a fan of the series,
[2256.31s -> 2259.43s]  I don't want to get into the uncharted territory of, like,
[2260.55s -> 2261.35s]  oh, this is stupid.
[2261.35s -> 2261.91s]  I don't like this.
[2261.91s -> 2262.87s]  Dumb game sucks.
[2264.07s -> 2267.75s]  If I was a fan of this game, I would love this shit.
[2267.75s -> 2269.99s]  Like, people, you're allowed to like things.
[2269.99s -> 2270.47s]  You know what I mean?
[2271.67s -> 2272.63s]  How should we decide?
[2273.51s -> 2274.55s]  I would love each frame.
[2275.35s -> 2282.18s]  So that's why I was like half joking, but it really is like,
[2282.18s -> 2284.26s]  it is authentically Guardians of the Galaxy.
[2286.79s -> 2290.95s]  It honestly seems like a lot of effort to put into one of the less popular series.
[2291.83s -> 2293.14s]  Who made this?
[2293.14s -> 2296.26s]  Did they say, oh, there's a Square Enix, but like a publisher.
[2296.26s -> 2297.22s]  Eidos Montreal.
[2299.62s -> 2301.62s]  Oh, that's what my shot was complaining about.
[2301.62s -> 2304.34s]  They said Deus Ex died for this.
[2304.34s -> 2305.22s]  Now I understand.
[2308.06s -> 2309.50s]  Oh, wait, is that Eidos Montreal?
[2310.30s -> 2311.02s]  Fairly certain.
[2315.22s -> 2316.58s]  I only got one face quote.
[2316.58s -> 2317.86s]  Are you sure about this, Peter?
[2318.74s -> 2319.78s]  Look at him.
[2319.78s -> 2328.42s]  Oh, isn't it super popular?
[2328.42s -> 2328.90s]  I don't know.
[2328.90s -> 2329.62s]  I'm a boomer.
[2330.50s -> 2331.54s]  I only like Spider-Man.
[2341.64s -> 2343.08s]  Guardians is really popular, yeah.
[2343.72s -> 2345.80s]  I mean, Disney knows.
[2346.76s -> 2348.36s]  They're making a bunch of rides, aren't they?
[2348.36s -> 2350.84s]  Aren't they changing Guardians to like a bunch of rides at Disney?
[2351.32s -> 2354.46s]  But when the time comes, it's definitely popular enough to do that.
[2357.93s -> 2358.73s]  True.
[2358.73s -> 2360.73s]  I think I'm still stuck like really.
[2360.73s -> 2362.01s]  It really is like a boomer thing.
[2362.01s -> 2366.73s]  I'm stuck when Guardians of the Galaxy only existed in Marvel's versus Capcom
[2366.73s -> 2368.25s]  and nobody knew who the characters were.
[2368.97s -> 2371.45s]  That's where my like brain ages.
[2371.45s -> 2373.99s]  Wait, what they they were.
[2376.09s -> 2377.29s]  Yeah, they were in the game.
[2377.29s -> 2377.77s]  That's right.
[2378.97s -> 2379.61s]  Holy shit.
[2380.74s -> 2382.18s]  I completely forgot about that.
[2385.93s -> 2390.25s]  Yeah, they also had a lot of the Doctor Strange characters in it.
[2390.25s -> 2394.25s]  And then Doctor Strange didn't have a movie either for like five years after Marvel.
[2395.45s -> 2399.29s]  So like everyone's like, who's Dormammu?
[2399.29s -> 2400.81s]  The heck is a dagger of Denon?
[2401.77s -> 2403.85s]  Isn't Dormammu like a playable character?
[2404.41s -> 2405.69s]  No, he's a boss, right?
[2406.41s -> 2407.21s]  No, he's playable.
[2407.85s -> 2409.13s]  The boss is Galactus.
[2409.13s -> 2409.63s]  Oh, right.
[2412.09s -> 2413.85s]  Yeah, Dormammu is in the game.
[2414.33s -> 2417.29s]  You're unlocking a part of my memory I did not think was going to get unlocked.
[2418.01s -> 2422.76s]  Dormammu, I'm here to bargain.
[2423.40s -> 2426.44s]  Yeah, I think they were working on all these movies
[2426.44s -> 2428.68s]  and didn't realize how long they would take to finish.
[2428.68s -> 2430.60s]  And then Marvel came out with all these characters
[2430.60s -> 2432.60s]  for like upcoming movies 10 years later.
[2433.48s -> 2439.69s]  This is a very long earlier.
[2442.73s -> 2444.17s]  Well, what else is this work?
[2444.17s -> 2445.05s]  What else are they going to show?
[2445.69s -> 2447.22s]  Hitman, I would assume.
[2448.76s -> 2450.68s]  There's a new Hitman like every month.
[2450.68s -> 2451.16s]  How could they?
[2451.16s -> 2452.28s]  No, no, no.
[2452.28s -> 2456.36s]  But Hitman is, I mean, I did hate one of the levels.
[2457.24s -> 2459.40s]  But didn't they just come out with like a new one?
[2459.40s -> 2459.72s]  Yeah.
[2459.72s -> 2461.56s]  And I hated one of the levels.
[2461.56s -> 2462.84s]  I thought it was the worst game.
[2462.84s -> 2465.00s]  I thought it was the worst level they've ever put in a Hitman game.
[2465.56s -> 2466.68s]  Germa speaks out.
[2467.40s -> 2467.96s]  But it was great.
[2468.84s -> 2470.67s]  Never mind.
[2471.69s -> 2473.69s]  But yeah, maybe they wouldn't be doing Hitman.
[2473.69s -> 2474.19s]  I don't know.
[2474.97s -> 2477.24s]  Tomb Raider, that's true.
[2477.24s -> 2478.04s]  Probably another Tomb Raider.
[2478.68s -> 2486.87s]  October, that's coming out like this way in like a couple months.
[2487.11s -> 2488.31s]  What year is it?
[2489.61s -> 2491.21s]  I'm not playing it until the Snyder cut.
[2491.77s -> 2493.30s]  That's only four months from now.
[2493.30s -> 2500.55s]  Going to revisit two iconic brands that are being remastered for modern platforms.
[2500.55s -> 2500.95s]  Oh.
[2500.95s -> 2505.03s]  First up, relive the classic games in the Final Fantasy series.
[2505.03s -> 2509.35s]  And then get one more peek at Legend of Mana ahead of its June 24th launch.
[2509.35s -> 2510.31s]  Oh, wait a minute.
[2510.31s -> 2511.03s]  I'm interested in that.
[2511.03s -> 2512.23s]  Am I pretending to like that?
[2512.23s -> 2512.79s]  Let's find out.
[2513.91s -> 2515.35s]  Are you what?
[2515.35s -> 2516.31s]  I might be pretending to like that.
[2516.31s -> 2518.47s]  I don't know why, but I think I like that.
[2518.47s -> 2519.51s]  Legends of Mana?
[2519.51s -> 2520.01s]  Yeah.
[2529.34s -> 2529.84s]  Mana?
[2533.62s -> 2534.58s]  What are they remastering?
[2535.14s -> 2535.62s]  All of them?
[2537.27s -> 2538.71s]  Wait, that's a lot.
[2541.10s -> 2544.30s]  Yeah, we're going to remaster every Final Fantasy ever.
[2546.62s -> 2547.12s]  Okay.
[2551.86s -> 2552.50s]  Do you like this?
[2553.30s -> 2553.86s]  I mean, that was...
[2554.66s -> 2557.16s]  I guess that's kind of cool.
[2567.86s -> 2572.50s]  Do you think that the last Final Fantasy is going to be called The Final Fantasy?
[2573.06s -> 2576.52s]  When they decide to stop?
[2576.52s -> 2579.24s]  I don't think they'll know it's the final one until it's too late.
[2579.24s -> 2585.18s]  Next, Earth's mightiest heroes continue their fight to defend the world in Marvel's Avengers.
[2585.18s -> 2588.86s]  The team at Crystal Dynamics is excited to share the latest updates with you.
[2588.86s -> 2589.50s]  Including new missions...
[2589.50s -> 2589.98s]  Oh, nice.
[2589.98s -> 2591.10s]  I've been wondering about this.
[2591.10s -> 2591.74s]  Yeah.
[2591.74s -> 2593.42s]  Please, God, come back to our game.
[2594.22s -> 2595.90s]  Please, for the love of God, play it again.
[2597.21s -> 2598.01s]  We swear.
[2598.01s -> 2599.13s]  We swear it's worth it.
[2599.13s -> 2600.25s]  Please, more than eight of you.
[2600.25s -> 2602.89s]  ...secure that super weapon at all costs.
[2602.89s -> 2606.70s]  Cosmic energy...
[2606.70s -> 2609.54s]  Is that...
[2609.54s -> 2610.98s]  Was that normal guy Thor?
[2610.98s -> 2611.78s]  ...counts, people.
[2611.78s -> 2612.90s]  Keep it moving.
[2612.90s -> 2624.20s]  It's beautiful, isn't it?
[2624.20s -> 2624.68s]  Marvel.
[2624.68s -> 2625.96s]  Yeah, it is like Marvel.
[2633.66s -> 2634.30s]  No music.
[2636.66s -> 2638.34s]  Yeah, they didn't even try on this one.
[2638.34s -> 2641.54s]  This is like when you put on like Big Bang Theory without the laugh track.
[2641.54s -> 2642.98s]  I will save it.
[2642.98s -> 2643.66s]  There you go.
[2645.08s -> 2645.58s]  Cool.
[2646.78s -> 2648.06s]  They're fucking up that cube.
[2649.62s -> 2652.02s]  You don't understand what that cube is capable of.
[2652.66s -> 2655.10s]  Cosmic cube.
[2668.76s -> 2669.56s]  Uh-huh.
[2669.56s -> 2675.22s]  Yeah, this feels really weird.
[2685.35s -> 2686.55s]  I feel like I...
[2686.55s -> 2687.51s]  I feel like I have like...
[2688.15s -> 2689.19s]  In like, Premiere.
[2689.27s -> 2692.81s]  Like I forgot to put the music track on it.
[2692.81s -> 2696.01s]  If you were gonna forget to put music on a game, it would be this one.
[2698.09s -> 2698.73s]  Oh, here we go.
[2708.06s -> 2708.70s]  So is every...
[2711.42s -> 2714.14s]  When did Square Enix get like all this Marvel license?
[2714.14s -> 2715.82s]  It's like the first two games are shown.
[2718.01s -> 2719.21s]  But when you get it, you run with it.
[2727.05s -> 2730.73s]  The sound of his like leather daddy suit as he walks to his throne.
[2733.54s -> 2734.10s]  I love it.
[2735.14s -> 2736.10s]  There needs to be music.
[2740.86s -> 2741.66s]  No, there doesn't.
[2742.38s -> 2743.66s]  It's way better without it.
[2749.02s -> 2752.30s]  How would you hear Black Panther's thighs grinding with music?
[2759.53s -> 2760.81s]  Can I just play this game?
[2764.63s -> 2765.99s]  I don't want like the Avenger...
[2765.99s -> 2767.99s]  All the Avengers Avengers crystal nightmare.
[2767.99s -> 2771.03s]  It does just have like a bunch of replayable enemy spawn games.
[2774.68s -> 2775.64s]  So what you're asking...
[2775.64s -> 2778.84s]  Okay, Jerma, what you're asking for is the Guardians of the Galaxy game.
[2781.05s -> 2783.45s]  This looks like way cooler than everything they just showed.
[2786.10s -> 2787.78s]  Yeah, because it's not in-game footage.
[2794.71s -> 2797.11s]  Did you get confused again and think that it was gameplay?
[2798.22s -> 2798.72s]  Fuck!
[2801.18s -> 2803.02s]  No, I'm not that stupid.
[2803.90s -> 2804.40s]  Okay.
[2812.22s -> 2812.94s]  Oh shoot!
[2812.94s -> 2813.44s]  Hitman!
[2814.40s -> 2818.64s]  I keep just turning on my webcam for four seconds.
[2818.64s -> 2819.68s]  Like, why do I even have it?
[2823.04s -> 2823.92s]  You're looking good today.
[2827.90s -> 2830.38s]  Wait, are we gonna get to play a mobile Hitman?
[2831.42s -> 2833.10s]  Oh, it's a sniper.
[2833.10s -> 2834.78s]  Like, they keep making the sniper game.
[2835.34s -> 2837.74s]  Yeah, they put snipers in it.
[2837.74s -> 2841.18s]  Earth, space, sniper, the trifecta.
[2841.18s -> 2844.81s]  Oh, they're not even trying.
[2848.43s -> 2849.47s]  There's no music.
[2851.52s -> 2854.32s]  At least make it funny and put crickets here, you know what I mean?
[2854.32s -> 2856.64s]  But I guess that'd be kind of rude to the developer, right?
[2856.64s -> 2861.58s]  Well, I don't know if it's Twitch that did this or they that did this.
[2862.14s -> 2864.84s]  Or they that did this.
[2867.85s -> 2873.82s]  So, there's definitely a voiceover here that is part of this.
[2873.82s -> 2881.48s]  Yeah, I mean, it must be Twitch because it's not like Square Enix had Sonic music.
[2881.48s -> 2887.44s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[2887.44s -> 2888.24s]  They listened, they heard us.
[2891.82s -> 2895.02s]  No, this is like old movies back in the olden days.
[2895.02s -> 2896.86s]  You probably remember when they would have to have
[2896.86s -> 2899.34s]  someone actually do the sound effects behind the projector.
[2900.22s -> 2901.96s]  Like, Twitch is doing this live.
[2902.68s -> 2909.53s]  What is this?
[2909.53s -> 2910.33s]  Is this Final Fantasy?
[2913.26s -> 2915.42s]  Yeah, I think there's a Final Fantasy Battle Royale.
[2916.52s -> 2916.92s]  Oh, wait.
[2916.92s -> 2918.36s]  No, that's the...
[2919.88s -> 2922.33s]  Catsith is going to be in that one, right?
[2922.33s -> 2922.73s]  Cats?
[2923.29s -> 2923.77s]  Catsith.
[2924.49s -> 2930.41s]  Today, the team at Platinum Games is giving you an exclusive look at the epic world of Babylon's Fall.
[2930.41s -> 2932.09s]  Final Fantasy VII.
[2932.09s -> 2934.49s]  Powerful weapons and a unique art style.
[2935.45s -> 2939.71s]  Yes, he has six strikes now.
[2939.71s -> 2942.59s]  And he hasn't given me any more.
[2942.59s -> 2945.44s]  I should have, twice at least.
[2946.32s -> 2948.06s]  Well, then you got to stay on it.
[2951.50s -> 2952.06s]  Catsith?
[2952.06s -> 2953.10s]  No, Catsith.
[2953.66s -> 2954.92s]  One with the dice.
[2954.92s -> 2956.12s]  That's my favorite character in any...
[2956.12s -> 2958.04s]  That's the only Final Fantasy character I even care about.
[2987.95s -> 2997.66s]  Does the savior of Neo Babylon stand among us?
[2997.66s -> 3000.70s]  Let's find out without further ado.
[3003.72s -> 3004.60s]  I like this game, though.
[3006.76s -> 3007.48s]  I knew you would.
[3007.48s -> 3008.84s]  I knew that'd sell you.
[3008.84s -> 3009.80s]  I'm sold already.
[3014.86s -> 3016.30s]  What Jerva voice was that?
[3019.26s -> 3021.90s]  If I'm to die, then I'll die for hope.
[3021.90s -> 3025.56s]  For what little hope?
[3025.56s -> 3025.80s]  This...
[3029.07s -> 3030.91s]  This does not look good.
[3031.47s -> 3032.51s]  I'm just gonna...
[3032.51s -> 3033.71s]  I'm gonna be blunt about it.
[3034.75s -> 3037.87s]  I feel like they announced this game like four or five years ago.
[3039.47s -> 3044.86s]  I don't understand, but it has...
[3048.70s -> 3050.06s]  Doesn't mean it's gonna be good.
[3050.06s -> 3052.70s]  It has 10 out of 10 voice acting and music choice.
[3053.95s -> 3054.83s]  Not muted music.
[3062.19s -> 3065.31s]  This voiceover reminds me of a lot of rock songs in the 80s.
[3066.03s -> 3070.89s]  It would kind of just like talk really weirdly over the music for a second,
[3070.89s -> 3071.77s]  and then they'd go into it.
[3080.78s -> 3087.40s]  It looks like they didn't finish the graphics.
[3087.40s -> 3091.48s]  They put a watercolor filter over everything to like hide it.
[3091.48s -> 3092.76s]  They just like smudged it all together.
[3095.16s -> 3099.53s]  I can't say I'm not interested, though.
[3099.53s -> 3102.17s]  I think I'm interested for a bunch of different reasons.
[3102.89s -> 3105.84s]  Well, because you're in it.
[3117.39s -> 3118.35s]  Did you play any of the near games?
[3120.43s -> 3121.79s]  I played near automata.
[3123.15s -> 3123.95s]  I thought it was fun.
[3125.39s -> 3125.95s]  What is it again?
[3126.75s -> 3128.19s]  I played near automata.
[3129.47s -> 3130.43s]  It's not automata?
[3132.27s -> 3133.15s]  Near automata.
[3135.47s -> 3136.35s]  Near automata?
[3138.19s -> 3139.07s]  Oh, well, all right.
[3139.07s -> 3139.39s]  Anyways.
[3141.31s -> 3141.87s]  Automata.
[3141.87s -> 3143.23s]  Yeah, I played near automata.
[3143.95s -> 3145.87s]  And it was fun.
[3145.87s -> 3149.63s]  But then everyone will tell you that you have to beat the game six times to actually enjoy it.
[3149.63s -> 3151.87s]  To which I say, nah.
[3155.31s -> 3156.11s]  It always looked fun.
[3157.47s -> 3158.27s]  I just never played it.
[3169.16s -> 3169.80s]  Should I play that?
[3172.04s -> 3174.44s]  Should I like stream near automata?
[3176.76s -> 3179.00s]  You're not going to do anything like weird while you play it, are you?
[3179.00s -> 3180.52s]  You're not going to, like, try and look up her skirt.
[3181.56s -> 3182.28s]  It's strike three.
[3182.28s -> 3182.68s]  He's gone.
[3183.32s -> 3183.72s]  Strike three.
[3183.72s -> 3184.20s]  He's out of here.
[3184.20s -> 3185.40s]  I'm voting him.
[3185.40s -> 3186.92s]  No, they built that into the...
[3189.08s -> 3189.72s]  He's beautiful.
[3189.72s -> 3190.44s]  He's gone.
[3190.44s -> 3190.92s]  It's strike three.
[3194.04s -> 3198.12s]  All right, you can come back if you apologize for getting a third strike.
[3199.32s -> 3203.00s]  I'd like to apologize to the German985 community about the remarks I made
[3203.00s -> 3206.76s]  in relation to German985 looking up a skirt.
[3207.48s -> 3209.00s]  He would never do that.
[3209.96s -> 3213.40s]  And I'd like to apologize for anyone that I offended that
[3215.48s -> 3219.00s]  enjoys even casually 2B fan art.
[3219.00s -> 3220.28s]  Highbrow 2B fan art.
[3220.92s -> 3223.60s]  You're the worst.
[3223.60s -> 3228.72s]  Now let's check out the next major entry in the popular Life is Strange series.
[3228.72s -> 3229.92s]  True Colors.
[3229.92s -> 3234.08s]  The team at Deck Nine is ready to give you a deeper look at Alex Chen's psychic power.
[3234.08s -> 3234.64s]  All right.
[3234.64s -> 3236.64s]  Did you play Life is Strange 1?
[3237.68s -> 3237.84s]  Yes.
[3238.80s -> 3240.72s]  Oh, you want to know how...
[3240.72s -> 3241.28s]  Like, okay.
[3241.28s -> 3242.00s]  I just...
[3242.00s -> 3244.24s]  I have every opinion that no one likes.
[3244.24s -> 3248.64s]  I think Life is Strange 1 is great and I think the ending is perfect
[3248.64s -> 3250.32s]  and exactly how it had to happen.
[3250.32s -> 3251.68s]  And everyone hates the ending.
[3251.68s -> 3253.20s]  So I'm just always wrong.
[3255.07s -> 3256.35s]  I thought it was good, yeah.
[3258.08s -> 3259.36s]  I thought it was really, really cool.
[3261.18s -> 3262.06s]  But I don't like...
[3262.86s -> 3264.30s]  I played Life is Strange.
[3264.30s -> 3266.06s]  I was like, oh, that was pretty cool.
[3266.78s -> 3267.58s]  I liked that.
[3267.58s -> 3269.10s]  That didn't look like much of a difference.
[3269.90s -> 3271.74s]  That doesn't look like it's very much of a change at all.
[3271.74s -> 3272.78s]  Oh, I didn't even notice.
[3272.78s -> 3273.74s]  This is a remaster.
[3273.74s -> 3274.94s]  Didn't this come out like...
[3275.66s -> 3276.78s]  That looked like...
[3276.78s -> 3282.38s]  That looked like when they do like the PS4 versus Xbox One graphic changes.
[3282.38s -> 3283.02s]  Like differences.
[3284.09s -> 3288.01s]  And I kind of felt like the splotchy characters was on purpose.
[3288.97s -> 3290.17s]  It was kind of the way it looked.
[3292.17s -> 3293.13s]  No, I liked Life is Strange.
[3293.93s -> 3295.45s]  I thought it was like really interesting.
[3296.65s -> 3297.29s]  I'm trying to remember...
[3297.29s -> 3298.65s]  Okay, obviously don't spoil the whole game.
[3298.65s -> 3302.08s]  I'm trying to remember the ending of Life is Strange.
[3302.08s -> 3302.48s]  Oh, my...
[3302.48s -> 3302.88s]  Well, there...
[3302.88s -> 3303.20s]  Oh, well...
[3304.64s -> 3307.23s]  Can't spoil that.
[3307.23s -> 3308.03s]  But wait, wait, wait.
[3308.03s -> 3308.51s]  Hold on.
[3308.51s -> 3309.15s]  This is...
[3309.15s -> 3310.11s]  Wait a minute.
[3310.11s -> 3310.75s]  I want to watch this.
[3321.37s -> 3322.09s]  No, this is not...
[3322.09s -> 3323.05s]  Life is Strange is like...
[3324.09s -> 3325.05s]  No, this is a remake.
[3325.05s -> 3325.93s]  I already know what's going on.
[3331.69s -> 3332.81s]  It's spoiling everything.
[3333.77s -> 3335.77s]  I guess they just assumed that you like already played it.
[3338.75s -> 3340.86s]  People didn't like the ending to Life is Strange.
[3343.50s -> 3345.58s]  Yeah, it was one of those like reddit opinions.
[3345.58s -> 3348.46s]  So it was probably a small minority of very vocal angry people.
[3349.26s -> 3352.06s]  I think it kind of fell in line with like none of your choices matter.
[3354.62s -> 3355.10s]  But that's...
[3355.10s -> 3357.34s]  I mean, that's just true of life because life is deterministic
[3357.34s -> 3361.10s]  and the simulation won't let you escape the bounds predetermined for you.
[3361.10s -> 3363.26s]  So like how is that not realistic?
[3363.26s -> 3364.54s]  Hey, you want me to go off on this?
[3365.42s -> 3366.62s]  You can see what he said.
[3366.62s -> 3367.26s]  What are you talking about?
[3367.26s -> 3367.74s]  It sucks.
[3372.62s -> 3373.10s]  This is...
[3373.10s -> 3373.98s]  You know what this reminds me of?
[3373.98s -> 3377.90s]  That reminds me of like those old infomercials for the HD sunglasses.
[3377.90s -> 3380.04s]  Remember those?
[3380.04s -> 3383.16s]  Put on the HD sunglasses and look at what the world looks like.
[3384.12s -> 3385.16s]  Brighten up your day.
[3385.88s -> 3389.16s]  Oh, this road sure does look boring, but with our HD technology.
[3389.16s -> 3390.52s]  And it does that little...
[3390.52s -> 3391.00s]  Oh, wow.
[3391.00s -> 3392.04s]  Look at how much different it looks.
[3392.68s -> 3393.72s]  Is this like a little bit better?
[3396.11s -> 3396.91s]  Of Hayden Springs.
[3397.64s -> 3401.64s]  Today, we have a first look at Alex's unique power in action.
[3401.64s -> 3404.20s]  Here's game director, Zach Harris, for more.
[3404.20s -> 3404.60s]  Haha.
[3404.60s -> 3405.96s]  Laugh my ass off, you're cringe.
[3407.00s -> 3407.48s]  Whoa.
[3407.48s -> 3407.80s]  Whoa.
[3407.80s -> 3409.00s]  Can we not bring up Kringa?
[3409.00s -> 3413.96s]  Alex's psychic power of empathy is integral to the story of Life is Strange True Colors.
[3413.96s -> 3414.36s]  Okay.
[3414.36s -> 3415.64s]  Quiet actually, because I'm interested in this.
[3415.64s -> 3419.24s]  Every relationship she builds and every decision she makes.
[3419.24s -> 3422.04s]  Never thought I'd have a freaky and bad friend.
[3422.52s -> 3426.92s]  For years, Alex has been unable to shut out the strong feelings of others.
[3426.92s -> 3431.16s]  The fear, sadness, and anger of those around her.
[3431.16s -> 3434.04s]  Leading her to believe her power is a curse.
[3435.16s -> 3436.76s]  In the wake of Gabe's death,
[3436.76s -> 3441.24s]  Alex realizes the only way she can find the truth is to embrace her power.
[3441.24s -> 3442.68s]  Is this part of the remaster or no?
[3442.68s -> 3443.48s]  This is a new game, right?
[3443.48s -> 3444.44s]  No, this is the new game.
[3445.32s -> 3451.16s]  And the only way to understand is to feel what he's feeling.
[3451.16s -> 3456.12s]  From the very start, you can use Alex's power to focus on brightly colored auras,
[3456.12s -> 3458.76s]  to gain an insight into people's emotions.
[3458.76s -> 3460.83s]  Gabe was too young.
[3460.83s -> 3463.31s]  Just too young.
[3463.31s -> 3468.35s]  These valuable insights deepen Alex's relationships with the folk of Haven Springs,
[3468.35s -> 3471.55s]  as well as sparking new dialogue options and events.
[3471.55s -> 3474.27s]  As here, from a scene very early on in the game.
[3474.83s -> 3475.71s]  You're gonna lose her.
[3476.27s -> 3479.47s]  You're gonna lose her and it's all your fault.
[3481.05s -> 3485.29s]  Alex has uncovered a secret that Mac wants to keep hidden from his long-term girlfriend.
[3486.33s -> 3490.81s]  And now he is terrified that Alex will reveal it before he can talk to Riley.
[3492.41s -> 3494.65s]  She is the best thing that's ever happened to me.
[3497.34s -> 3497.90s]  Please.
[3497.90s -> 3499.90s]  Wait, do they know she's in their head?
[3499.90s -> 3504.88s]  Mac's telling you a whole lot of bullshit.
[3505.68s -> 3507.12s]  Thanks for telling me the truth, Alex.
[3508.08s -> 3508.56s]  Do they know?
[3510.72s -> 3513.60s]  I think they were implying that you confronted him or he caught you.
[3513.76s -> 3514.56s]  I don't know, man.
[3514.56s -> 3514.96s]  I don't know.
[3516.00s -> 3517.52s]  That would be really weird if they could know.
[3519.04s -> 3521.44s]  Honestly, that's actually kind of an interesting idea.
[3521.44s -> 3525.12s]  Being able to read people's minds and have to make decisions based on knowing what they know.
[3527.28s -> 3528.40s]  They don't know that you know.
[3528.40s -> 3529.04s]  That's kind of weird.
[3533.12s -> 3537.68s]  I think what this really just comes down to is that people should just talk.
[3537.68s -> 3539.28s]  They should tell everyone how they're feeling.
[3539.84s -> 3542.16s]  Um, and they should open up.
[3543.87s -> 3546.99s]  And, you know, let's just let it out, Jerma.
[3549.55s -> 3550.35s]  What have you been hiding?
[3561.10s -> 3562.46s]  Scream Disco Elsion.
[3564.06s -> 3565.02s]  Oh, it's a long game.
[3571.32s -> 3595.18s]  The only emotion she can't feel are her own.
[3604.54s -> 3606.14s]  That's not that far away.
[3620.62s -> 3621.90s]  Somebody said acting.
[3622.94s -> 3623.34s]  Oh, yeah.
[3623.34s -> 3626.38s]  I mean, they're actors acting as characters in a game.
[3628.04s -> 3628.68s]  Oh, fuck it.
[3628.68s -> 3629.56s]  Oh, actors.
[3632.12s -> 3632.84s]  What?
[3632.84s -> 3634.52s]  Somebody said, well, fucking acting.
[3636.80s -> 3638.72s]  Yeah, but why did you pick that comment out?
[3638.72s -> 3639.04s]  I don't know.
[3639.04s -> 3640.40s]  Like, make a point.
[3640.40s -> 3641.68s]  Like, everyone else are you guys.
[3641.68s -> 3642.08s]  It's interesting.
[3642.08s -> 3643.12s]  We are excited to...
[3643.12s -> 3645.20s]  Anyone who missed out, these are actors.
[3646.56s -> 3647.52s]  I thought it was funny.
[3647.52s -> 3648.32s]  I thought it was interesting.
[3649.04s -> 3660.25s]  To kill Chaos.
[3661.13s -> 3662.01s]  That's my mission.
[3663.80s -> 3664.36s]  I just want...
[3664.36s -> 3665.08s]  At one point...
[3665.08s -> 3665.88s]  Oh, wait, quiet.
[3668.09s -> 3670.25s]  Looks like Chaos has been waiting for us.
[3672.12s -> 3674.28s]  You gonna make us go in there and find you?
[3675.29s -> 3677.05s]  Guess we'll just show ourselves here.
[3679.48s -> 3681.00s]  I only know one thing.
[3681.56s -> 3683.82s]  We want to kill Chaos.
[3684.78s -> 3685.50s]  We need to.
[3686.78s -> 3688.46s]  It's not a hope or a dream.
[3689.18s -> 3691.63s]  It's like a hunger, a thirst.
[3694.43s -> 3695.63s]  I'm pretending Andy right now.
[3695.63s -> 3697.95s]  I've not played one Devil May Cry game.
[3698.67s -> 3704.11s]  I'm not even sure I've put a Team Ninja disc into the tray of any console I've ever owned.
[3704.11s -> 3704.91s]  I'm serious.
[3704.91s -> 3706.51s]  Why am I pretending to be excited for this?
[3706.99s -> 3709.23s]  This is the shrine of Chaos.
[3709.23s -> 3710.35s]  He's here.
[3713.55s -> 3714.43s]  Is that rhetorical?
[3715.95s -> 3717.87s]  Maybe it's because I think everyone's really excited for this.
[3717.87s -> 3721.47s]  So if I say like, oh, whoa, Team Ninja, people will think I'm cool and like me.
[3721.47s -> 3722.03s]  This is it.
[3722.67s -> 3722.91s]  Yeah.
[3723.63s -> 3723.87s]  Yeah.
[3723.87s -> 3724.43s]  No, you know.
[3725.95s -> 3726.19s]  Yeah.
[3727.47s -> 3729.79s]  Like, I know they make good games and I know the games usually are pretty good.
[3729.79s -> 3733.31s]  You know that other people care about it and you're receptive.
[3733.31s -> 3738.03s]  You have the empathy power to know what empathies other people are feeling and you respect their
[3738.03s -> 3742.27s]  feelings and you want to not have me talking over their favorite games so they don't say comments
[3742.27s -> 3744.03s]  like shut up, star shot, I'm listening.
[3744.03s -> 3744.67s]  I needed him.
[3744.67s -> 3745.39s]  Let's strike five.
[3760.89s -> 3763.61s]  I think this plot of this game has something to do with killing Chaos.
[3781.28s -> 3785.26s]  Stranger of Paradise.
[3785.26s -> 3786.62s]  Final Fantasy Origin.
[3789.48s -> 3791.64s]  No, see, they didn't call it the Final Fantasy.
[3791.64s -> 3792.20s]  They didn't.
[3792.20s -> 3793.32s]  They called it.
[3793.32s -> 3794.44s]  Well, that's the first one.
[3794.44s -> 3796.12s]  This is this is Final Fantasy zero.
[3796.12s -> 3799.08s]  Well, isn't the first one also the Final Fantasy?
[3801.79s -> 3802.83s]  No others have happened yet.
[3805.45s -> 3809.05s]  I mean, it's Final Fantasy one, essentially.
[3816.09s -> 3817.39s]  Like what?
[3817.95s -> 3819.07s]  Oh, Final Fantasy seven.
[3819.71s -> 3824.75s]  I actually okay.
[3824.75s -> 3826.51s]  I talked a lot of shit about this game.
[3827.15s -> 3830.67s]  When we remember the original trailer that like three or four years ago.
[3830.67s -> 3833.55s]  I was I talked about Final Fantasy seven's remake.
[3833.55s -> 3839.23s]  I talked a bunch of shit and it I mean it looked actually kind of looks kind of fun.
[3841.95s -> 3843.58s]  Okay, is that it?
[3844.30s -> 3846.27s]  Is it no more?
[3848.60s -> 3849.24s]  Who could say?
[3849.80s -> 3854.64s]  Well, it was just like a couple of Marvel games and I guess they did show.
[3855.44s -> 3858.00s]  I mean, Square Enix is not like fucking Microsoft.
[3866.60s -> 3868.28s]  Just a couple of Marvel games.
[3868.28s -> 3868.76s]  Fuck you.
[3868.76s -> 3869.80s]  Thank you for joining us.
[3869.80s -> 3870.28s]  That's it.
[3870.28s -> 3873.00s]  Keep an eye out for news about our next Square.
[3873.00s -> 3873.88s]  Thank you for joining us.
[3874.52s -> 3879.24s]  All they showed was just a couple of Marvel games and some Final Fantasies.
[3879.24s -> 3880.44s]  Like thank you for joining us.
[3880.44s -> 3885.32s]  Our entire fucking budget of like 700 million dollars went to getting the licensed characters
[3885.32s -> 3888.60s]  for Guardians of the Galaxy and the Avengers.
[3888.60s -> 3895.61s]  So we had no leftover for the licensing for the music we used in that same trailer.
[3895.61s -> 3896.49s]  Well, all right.
[3896.49s -> 3897.61s]  No, I guess they have it.
[3897.61s -> 3898.49s]  Twitch doesn't have it.
[3898.49s -> 3899.82s]  Never mind.
[3899.82s -> 3900.78s]  I'm just wrong.
[3900.78s -> 3901.66s]  And no, Spider-Man.
[3905.79s -> 3910.43s]  We are definitely not going to sit around and let stir become a brand risk for an hour
[3910.43s -> 3911.71s]  and a half to wait for the PC show.
[3912.35s -> 3913.55s]  So that's not going to happen.
[3915.60s -> 3917.66s]  What did you think?
[3919.74s -> 3923.55s]  Um, none of that was for me.
[3925.15s -> 3925.87s]  I gotta get a haircut.
[3927.92s -> 3928.80s]  Hey, talk about the game.
[3928.80s -> 3930.08s]  This guy's coming to here talking about haircuts.
[3931.04s -> 3932.64s]  Look, we're trying to talk about the games.
[3933.69s -> 3935.13s]  I'm hiding it very well, aren't I?
[3935.13s -> 3938.57s]  No, honestly, if Square Enix were going to show anything,
[3938.57s -> 3943.53s]  I don't understand why they wouldn't show the new Final Fantasy that they've been working on,
[3943.53s -> 3945.29s]  which seemed mostly complete.
[3945.29s -> 3947.29s]  So you would think they would have gameplay or some more.
[3947.29s -> 3950.81s]  Because what I've I've never really cared about a Final Fantasy before,
[3951.37s -> 3955.05s]  but that one looked really pretty and had like garbage swamp monsters.
[3955.05s -> 3957.61s]  So I wanted to see more and I don't know where it was.
[3957.61s -> 3958.81s]  Do you think I would count all off?
[3962.01s -> 3963.05s]  You're still talking about your hair.
[3964.96s -> 3966.88s]  Um, Square Enix.
[3966.88s -> 3968.64s]  Well, we're just giving free advertisements here.
[3968.64s -> 3969.14s]  Turn it off.
[3970.48s -> 3978.49s]  Um, what is, um, oh, no, I don't know.
[3978.49s -> 3978.89s]  What is it?
[3978.89s -> 3982.33s]  So Square, I guess the Final Fantasy thing is pretty cool, right?
[3982.89s -> 3984.22s]  That actually is probably the biggest thing.
[3984.22s -> 3984.72s]  Which one?
[3985.66s -> 3989.90s]  The final fantasy origins thing, the actual like the team ninja game.
[3989.90s -> 3992.35s]  That's kind of a big deal.
[3992.35s -> 3994.03s]  Okay, I agree.
[3994.03s -> 3996.56s]  That game probably be fun.
[4001.08s -> 4001.58s]  Yep.
[4002.84s -> 4004.68s]  What else are you supposed to do on?
[4004.68s -> 4005.48s]  You know what I mean?
[4005.56s -> 4006.44s]  That's the thing.
[4006.44s -> 4008.86s]  Like, okay, I just.
[4008.86s -> 4009.98s]  Exactly, Jerma.
[4011.44s -> 4015.20s]  If you're just excited about everything, you can't say anything.
[4015.20s -> 4018.25s]  You need to let your hate out.
[4018.25s -> 4022.33s]  You have so much within you.
[4022.33s -> 4022.97s]  Just give it.
[4022.97s -> 4024.57s]  Yes, chaos.
[4024.57s -> 4031.42s]  I, but I've, I've, I've said my pieces about how I don't like certain things.
[4031.42s -> 4033.02s]  We've already, we've gone over them today.
[4033.02s -> 4038.65s]  We've talked about things that I didn't like.
[4039.29s -> 4042.33s]  This is mostly me, but there wasn't much.
[4042.33s -> 4044.11s]  I know what you're talking about.
[4044.11s -> 4045.87s]  You're, I, you, I really like you.
[4046.19s -> 4048.19s]  I just keep getting attacked lately.
[4048.19s -> 4050.03s]  My wife keeps attacking me.
[4050.03s -> 4053.93s]  Well, I don't, that's between you and your wife.
[4053.93s -> 4055.28s]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[4055.28s -> 4059.55s]  So he hates Capcom.
[4059.55s -> 4060.35s]  Wait, Capcom?
[4060.35s -> 4061.23s]  What, what?
[4061.23s -> 4065.32s]  I said fuck Capcom like two, three weeks ago because.
[4065.32s -> 4066.36s]  All right, let me ask you this.
[4066.36s -> 4070.68s]  The only game you've played in like the last year was the Resident Evil one, which is Capcom.
[4071.16s -> 4076.22s]  Listen, so I said I've opened up Resident Evil 8 on PC
[4076.22s -> 4077.90s]  and the game's not 90 FOV.
[4077.90s -> 4080.94s]  It's locked at like 81 and you can't change it.
[4080.94s -> 4082.52s]  So I freaked out.
[4082.52s -> 4084.36s]  I've said, I said, fuck Capcom.
[4084.36s -> 4085.80s]  Fuck this whole company.
[4085.80s -> 4088.12s]  And people were like, whoa, dude, fucking relax.
[4088.12s -> 4091.16s]  People were like actually like selling, saying, hey, dude, relax.
[4091.16s -> 4092.36s]  Like it's not that big of a deal.
[4092.36s -> 4094.91s]  And I was like, I, I didn't even backpedal.
[4094.91s -> 4096.99s]  I just doubled down and was like, no, fuck that.
[4096.99s -> 4098.11s]  That's fucking bullshit.
[4098.11s -> 4102.33s]  And I went off on how like surprised that 81 FOV.
[4102.33s -> 4104.33s]  Cause it's like, it makes me sick.
[4104.33s -> 4104.97s]  It doesn't, it makes me.
[4104.97s -> 4107.53s]  And they're like, yeah, I got used to it after like three hours.
[4107.53s -> 4108.97s]  But like, what, how do you feel about that?
[4108.97s -> 4110.19s]  Don't you feel like it?
[4110.19s -> 4112.67s]  I feel that you shouldn't have to get used to it.
[4112.67s -> 4114.51s]  They should get used to developing games
[4114.51s -> 4116.75s]  that you can play without feeling nauseous.
[4116.75s -> 4118.35s]  Thank you.
[4118.35s -> 4119.56s]  Yes.
[4119.56s -> 4122.84s]  But when you come, see, you're, you're, you put a foot into my world.
[4122.84s -> 4126.04s]  When you complain about a game, it's your fault for complaining.
[4126.04s -> 4129.88s]  And then a whole bunch of people show up to like praise the corporation
[4129.88s -> 4131.88s]  who created this for me.
[4131.88s -> 4133.08s]  And you're just satisfied with it.
[4133.08s -> 4137.31s]  But if you're satisfied, they just keep shitting on you.
[4137.31s -> 4139.95s]  So in reality, you want.
[4139.95s -> 4140.91s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[4141.07s -> 4142.27s]  Resident Evil 2 is like one of my favorite games
[4142.27s -> 4143.07s]  the last like five years.
[4143.07s -> 4144.04s]  Don't say that.
[4144.04s -> 4144.84s]  Resident Evil 2.
[4146.06s -> 4146.70s]  The remake.
[4146.70s -> 4152.27s]  Doesn't that make you sad that your favorite game is a remake of an old game?
[4152.99s -> 4153.95s]  It was very good.
[4153.95s -> 4157.07s]  Like, look, I know, I understand the sentiment of like remake.
[4157.07s -> 4159.31s]  Oh, it was so good.
[4159.31s -> 4162.99s]  Mr. X is like one of my favorite things and, and five years at least.
[4164.94s -> 4167.74s]  But no, so what you're saying is you're, you just want it.
[4167.74s -> 4169.34s]  You want things to be better, right?
[4169.34s -> 4171.02s]  You want the world, you want things to be better.
[4171.02s -> 4172.46s]  You want the game to be better.
[4172.46s -> 4172.78s]  Okay.
[4172.78s -> 4175.50s]  Yeah, I can say I can sit there and listen to that.
[4175.50s -> 4179.24s]  The remake is so different from the original.
[4179.24s -> 4180.44s]  That's also true.
[4180.44s -> 4182.20s]  It's very different than the original.
[4182.20s -> 4182.68s]  So I don't know.
[4182.68s -> 4185.66s]  Is it an entire I've never played.
[4185.66s -> 4190.11s]  I played like half of Resident Evil 1.
[4190.11s -> 4192.27s]  Remake 2 is a great example of a good remake.
[4192.27s -> 4192.99s]  Yeah, it is.
[4192.99s -> 4195.07s]  It's fantastic.
[4195.07s -> 4198.35s]  I think by compact, like I think they gave people so much hope
[4198.35s -> 4201.63s]  for how good Resident Evil 2 was because I actually I didn't play it.
[4201.63s -> 4204.27s]  But I watched a lot of speed runs and a lot of people were really enjoying it.
[4204.27s -> 4205.39s]  And I watched playthroughs and all that.
[4205.39s -> 4207.77s]  But what was the one that came out after that?
[4207.77s -> 4215.04s]  The next remake that was like, yeah, that in comparison was like severely lacking.
[4215.04s -> 4216.64s]  And that's what you that's what I'm saying.
[4216.64s -> 4217.92s]  You get complacent.
[4217.92s -> 4220.16s]  You let Capcom take a fucking inch.
[4220.16s -> 4221.76s]  I don't think the same team.
[4221.76s -> 4222.72s]  I don't think Resident Evil 3.
[4222.72s -> 4225.26s]  The remake was made by the same people that made the second one.
[4225.26s -> 4227.32s]  Am I wrong?
[4227.32s -> 4228.60s]  You make an excuses for him.
[4228.60s -> 4229.64s]  No, I'm just saying I don't.
[4229.64s -> 4231.88s]  I think it was a different team that made Resident Evil 2.
[4231.88s -> 4233.80s]  He's making excuses for our remake.
[4233.80s -> 4235.53s]  It was a different team.
[4235.53s -> 4238.33s]  Yeah, no, it was a different team entirely.
[4238.81s -> 4241.29s]  Made the third remake versus the second remake.
[4241.29s -> 4242.01s]  So there you go.
[4242.01s -> 4244.60s]  There's your answer.
[4244.60s -> 4245.16s]  Okay.
[4245.16s -> 4251.84s]  You're a Capcom shill.
[4251.84s -> 4255.95s]  Okay, let's be honest besides Resident Evil 3's remake.
[4255.95s -> 4262.97s]  The last the last like four or five major Capcom releases have been very good.
[4262.97s -> 4265.05s]  Haven't they?
[4265.05s -> 4267.13s]  Monster Hunter World was really fun.
[4267.13s -> 4268.65s]  I like how I liked it.
[4268.65s -> 4271.69s]  They have been doing a redemption story.
[4271.69s -> 4278.11s]  Resident Evil 7 was really fun except the boat sequence was like a fucking zero out of 10.
[4278.11s -> 4281.55s]  So the game the first like three hours of Resident Evil 7 were like a 9.0.
[4281.55s -> 4283.71s]  And then I've said this a million times.
[4283.71s -> 4286.75s]  The last like third of Resident Evil 7 is like a two.
[4286.75s -> 4288.09s]  So it averages out.
[4288.09s -> 4290.36s]  But Resident Evil 8 was really fun too.
[4290.36s -> 4291.40s]  I really liked Resident Evil 8.
[4291.40s -> 4294.32s]  I thought it was great.
[4294.32s -> 4295.28s]  Did you play 7?
[4295.28s -> 4295.68s]  I did.
[4295.68s -> 4296.16s]  Yeah.
[4296.16s -> 4298.80s]  Did you just not listen to a single thing I just said for the last two minutes?
[4298.80s -> 4301.12s]  I'm just checking and make sure no chatter left behind.
[4301.12s -> 4302.08s]  There were some people asking.
[4302.64s -> 4304.88s]  Do you like 7 more than 8 or which one more?
[4305.95s -> 4307.39s]  I had that debate here in this chat.
[4307.39s -> 4308.19s]  I don't know.
[4308.19s -> 4310.43s]  I think 8 is a better video game.
[4310.43s -> 4314.96s]  But I think 7's potentially like more interesting setting.
[4314.96s -> 4317.82s]  8 is probably a better video game to me.
[4317.82s -> 4320.78s]  7 is like a more interesting place I think.
[4320.78s -> 4321.18s]  I like them.
[4321.18s -> 4322.62s]  I like the idea.
[4322.62s -> 4325.66s]  From my perspective of again I haven't played either of them.
[4325.66s -> 4327.34s]  I just watched people play them.
[4327.34s -> 4329.42s]  I thought 7 was much much better.
[4329.42s -> 4332.94s]  But to say like yeah I could see how you could enjoy the gameplay of 8 more.
[4332.94s -> 4334.62s]  And I'm like I'm not even playing it.
[4334.62s -> 4335.50s]  Did you play 7 and 8?
[4335.50s -> 4336.88s]  Did you play both of them or no?
[4336.88s -> 4337.12s]  No.
[4338.08s -> 4339.60s]  Like I just said are you even listening to me?
[4339.60s -> 4342.38s]  I watched people play both of them.
[4342.54s -> 4344.06s]  We don't even listen to each other.
[4344.06s -> 4346.46s]  We just wait for the opportunity for the next person to talk.
[4346.46s -> 4348.46s]  Fucking political argument right here.
[4349.34s -> 4350.46s]  This is ridiculous.
[4350.46s -> 4351.82s]  This is like a case study.
[4351.82s -> 4358.67s]  We both just did not comprehend completely the last sentence both of us just said to each other.
[4362.33s -> 4364.01s]  That just happened in real time.
[4364.01s -> 4366.65s]  I'm just going to space out until it's time to make my point.
[4366.65s -> 4369.29s]  I'm going to space it out until I'm going to say yeah Resident Evil 8 was fun.
[4371.64s -> 4372.20s]  I liked it.
[4372.20s -> 4375.44s]  I think because here's the thing.
[4375.44s -> 4382.59s]  There's like this this period of Resident Evil before 6 and Resident Evil after 6.
[4382.59s -> 4387.79s]  They like there was like an absolute like catastrophe around Resident Evil 6.
[4387.79s -> 4388.43s]  Because Resident Evil 4 was incredible.
[4388.43s -> 4393.10s]  I don't even remember what 6 was.
[4393.10s -> 4396.94s]  Was that the like action-y co-op like I don't even know.
[4396.94s -> 4398.38s]  It was awful.
[4398.38s -> 4401.66s]  It was just like you shoot machine guns at other guys with machine guns.
[4401.66s -> 4403.90s]  The game was awful awful awful.
[4403.90s -> 4408.94s]  So before 6 they had this kind of idea of like oh yeah we'll do like the third person stuff.
[4408.94s -> 4411.34s]  And like well yeah 4 was incredible.
[4411.34s -> 4412.54s]  5 was really good.
[4413.34s -> 4415.58s]  There was some issues with 5 but it was very very very fun.
[4415.58s -> 4416.54s]  I love 5.
[4416.54s -> 4419.50s]  And then they just went full-blown like third person shooter.
[4419.50s -> 4422.00s]  And it was just like well this is kind of stupid.
[4422.00s -> 4424.40s]  So then then we're like oh like we gotta fucking get out of here.
[4424.40s -> 4425.84s]  We gotta we gotta change this completely.
[4425.84s -> 4428.24s]  They go back to 7 which is first person.
[4428.24s -> 4430.97s]  More scary kind of scary shit.
[4430.97s -> 4434.17s]  And then they go to 8 which is more kind of scary shit but more gameplay.
[4434.99s -> 4438.68s]  I am terrified of Resident Evil 9.
[4438.68s -> 4442.12s]  Because they might just go full first person like shooter and ruin it.
[4442.12s -> 4444.38s]  When they do the third one in a new set.
[4444.38s -> 4445.82s]  That's why you have to be careful.
[4445.82s -> 4448.76s]  Did Capcom show stuff?
[4448.76s -> 4451.28s]  I don't know I don't think so.
[4451.28s -> 4452.96s]  5 was good yeah no 5 was good.
[4452.96s -> 4456.80s]  But I'm concerned if they continue the first person shit with Resident Evil.
[4456.80s -> 4462.97s]  If 9 is going to be like the one that everybody goes oh I don't know about this one.
[4462.97s -> 4466.08s]  They they have a tendency to do that.
[4466.08s -> 4469.28s]  Capcom's tomorrow they're spreading this out to Monday?
[4470.44s -> 4471.40s]  I guess so yeah.
[4471.40s -> 4473.40s]  They usually it's four days.
[4473.40s -> 4479.71s]  Okay oh I can we just show all the games on one day.
[4479.71s -> 4482.51s]  Then have all the bad ones like not be upvoted on Reddit.
[4482.51s -> 4484.67s]  And everyone like misses the announcement.
[4484.67s -> 4486.27s]  Well you can't do everything in one day.
[4486.27s -> 4487.63s]  Because if you do everything in one day.
[4487.63s -> 4491.63s]  Then it would be there would be no time to even digest what happened.
[4491.63s -> 4496.06s]  I guess I'm looking forward to see if Dragon's Dogma 2 gets announced.
[4496.06s -> 4497.34s]  That's the stir game.
[4497.34s -> 4499.04s]  That is the stir game.
[4499.04s -> 4500.81s]  I remember you loved that game.
[4500.81s -> 4506.00s]  You played Resident Evil 4 on stream.
[4506.00s -> 4510.56s]  No I I played Resident Evil 4 like five times across five consoles.
[4510.56s -> 4515.93s]  So I don't think you'll ever see it here.
[4515.93s -> 4520.52s]  I beat the Resident Evil 4 Wii port three times.
[4520.52s -> 4521.72s]  That was so good.
[4521.72s -> 4524.52s]  The Wii version of that game was I remember playing it and going.
[4524.52s -> 4526.36s]  This is what the Wii is for.
[4526.36s -> 4528.76s]  This is this is exactly what the Wii is for.
[4528.76s -> 4531.58s]  So I love that version.
[4531.58s -> 4537.66s]  It was great.
[4537.66s -> 4538.81s]  Yep.
[4538.81s -> 4539.53s]  But yeah.
[4539.53s -> 4540.03s]  Yep.
[4542.11s -> 4547.55s]  Any final thoughts stir before you get a seventh or eighth strike.
[4547.63s -> 4550.59s]  I am I'm not getting a seventh strike.
[4550.59s -> 4551.55s]  I'm being a good boy.
[4552.11s -> 4552.51s]  I don't know.
[4552.51s -> 4554.35s]  Are you waiting for the PC gaming show?
[4554.35s -> 4555.23s]  Are you doing that?
[4555.23s -> 4556.99s]  Are we going to like reconnect?
[4557.63s -> 4559.39s]  You got to get another coffee.
[4559.39s -> 4561.95s]  I mean that's in that's in like an hour and 12 minutes.
[4562.83s -> 4566.54s]  There's no way we're going to sit here and burn an hour and a half.
[4566.54s -> 4567.34s]  I'll watch it.
[4567.34s -> 4568.70s]  I'll watch it on my big screen.
[4570.32s -> 4571.20s]  Big screen.
[4571.20s -> 4577.12s]  You know I've had the same TV for like probably 10 years.
[4577.12s -> 4579.28s]  I don't know why I get another TV.
[4579.28s -> 4579.76s]  You know what I mean.
[4579.76s -> 4581.12s]  If it's a flat screen it's fine.
[4581.12s -> 4581.68s]  It's 1080.
[4581.68s -> 4582.24s]  What's the problem?
[4582.24s -> 4584.35s]  I don't know what's the problem.
[4584.35s -> 4589.55s]  I think my TV that I have I bought because YouTube gave me a gift card
[4589.55s -> 4591.95s]  for getting like 20,000 subscribers.
[4591.95s -> 4593.15s]  Wait what?
[4593.15s -> 4597.05s]  So they gave a gift card to like some electronics store.
[4597.05s -> 4598.49s]  It was like 500 bucks.
[4598.49s -> 4598.97s]  They did?
[4598.97s -> 4604.25s]  And I bought a $500 TV and I still have it and it's really it's really aging.
[4604.25s -> 4605.85s]  Where's my $500 gift card?
[4605.85s -> 4607.53s]  That is really weird that they did too.
[4607.53s -> 4609.37s]  Thinking back and I was like wow that what?
[4609.37s -> 4612.92s]  I didn't get a $500 gift card to go get a new cool TV.
[4614.75s -> 4619.07s]  Yeah well all right well I don't know what to say.
[4619.07s -> 4623.05s]  Well what's the next video game you want to play?
[4623.05s -> 4627.21s]  I think I think I would like to I would like to if you would agree to it.
[4627.21s -> 4631.13s]  I would like to get in I would like to do VR with you again because that was a lot of fun
[4631.13s -> 4632.97s]  and I have a lot of good memories a lot of fun times
[4632.97s -> 4634.41s]  during that VR stream that we did together.
[4634.41s -> 4636.73s]  Would you would you do VR again multiplayer stuff?
[4636.73s -> 4637.93s]  Let's do VR.
[4637.93s -> 4642.60s]  Are there any VR like Half-Life Alex mods that are multiplayer?
[4642.60s -> 4644.67s]  It might be well if we can look into it.
[4644.67s -> 4649.07s]  I feel like I feel like someone and not Valve I wouldn't I wouldn't put this on Valve.
[4649.63s -> 4650.91s]  Someone else has to make that.
[4650.91s -> 4652.91s]  Have we even talked since Alex even came out?
[4652.91s -> 4656.28s]  Like have we even like what have we talked about that?
[4656.28s -> 4657.56s]  Uh I think so.
[4657.56s -> 4661.93s]  Oh Game of the Year was Half-Life Alex right it wasn't Hades it was Half-Life Alex I forgot.
[4661.93s -> 4665.77s]  I I bought it when it came out instantly I still have not played it.
[4665.77s -> 4668.09s]  You would yeah we definitely have talked about it because
[4668.09s -> 4670.41s]  I was talking about it with you and saying how I didn't
[4670.41s -> 4672.97s]  you didn't like how it looked like the game had a lot of downtime
[4672.97s -> 4674.89s]  and like puzzles in between shooting.
[4674.89s -> 4677.44s]  That part and you were like it sucks but it's all right.
[4677.44s -> 4680.78s]  Yeah there's a lot of like just hold the globe
[4680.78s -> 4683.42s]  and like turn it awkwardly while you press like four buttons.
[4683.42s -> 4687.66s]  Yeah that happens a lot but you got to play that game.
[4687.66s -> 4691.50s]  You have to that's that that game is for all like the tiny little
[4691.50s -> 4693.02s]  like turn the globe puzzles.
[4693.02s -> 4696.70s]  They put like there's probably realistically like 50 of those in the game.
[4696.70s -> 4698.54s]  People are saying there are multiplayer mods.
[4698.54s -> 4702.60s]  Is it just of the campaign or I don't know.
[4702.60s -> 4706.76s]  I think it would be pretty funny actually if you backseat at me through Half-Life Alex in VR.
[4707.96s -> 4711.64s]  You having played it and me not having you make you make me the uh the
[4711.72s -> 4713.24s]  I turn into Dinklebot.
[4713.24s -> 4716.59s]  I just like float around with you and just tell you things.
[4716.59s -> 4717.15s]  Yeah.
[4717.15s -> 4720.65s]  So I would just be like experiencing the whole game again without doing anything.
[4721.45s -> 4724.40s]  Well now you can like play I don't know.
[4724.40s -> 4727.95s]  I would just have to play the whole game again.
[4727.95s -> 4731.16s]  Well it's your game of the year is that like is that so bad.
[4731.16s -> 4733.64s]  Yeah but I look I listen to me.
[4733.64s -> 4737.79s]  I was that one game that we played the one YouTube video the Groundhog Day
[4737.79s -> 4741.07s]  where like I was the cameraman and you were running in every single time.
[4743.37s -> 4744.57s]  Damned of something.
[4744.57s -> 4747.05s]  It was a motorcycle where you were you like Burger Boy.
[4747.05s -> 4749.13s]  No there was no motorcycle.
[4749.13s -> 4750.65s]  Yeah no it was it was the Pop-Tart joke.
[4750.65s -> 4751.93s]  They're going through the glass.
[4751.93s -> 4754.01s]  No that's a totally different game.
[4754.01s -> 4755.45s]  No it's not.
[4755.45s -> 4756.25s]  Yes it is.
[4756.25s -> 4759.93s]  Where I kept what you kept jumping into like frame through the glass.
[4759.93s -> 4762.17s]  That was the that was like the you Burger Boy puked on yourself.
[4762.17s -> 4763.13s]  That's not what I was talking.
[4763.13s -> 4767.53s]  I was talking about the game where I was like the hacker and you were the person in the world.
[4767.53s -> 4771.95s]  Like clandestine clandestine clandestine something clandestine.
[4771.95s -> 4774.38s]  Yeah that's the game that was really fun.
[4776.76s -> 4778.92s]  You can clandestine me.
[4778.92s -> 4781.02s]  Don't you think that like Half-Life Alex.
[4781.02s -> 4784.78s]  Do you ever just want to go back and like delete all the your old YouTube videos so
[4784.78s -> 4787.26s]  we could like play those like games and do it again on stream.
[4788.97s -> 4791.93s]  So they never look we're doing it it's like fun.
[4791.93s -> 4796.96s]  Hey you know what uh blood packed if you delete your YouTube channel I'll delete mine.
[4796.96s -> 4802.59s]  No that's not happening.
[4802.59s -> 4804.59s]  I'm not deleting my YouTube channel.
[4804.59s -> 4808.96s]  And then we'll go back and try and remember our videos and try and remake them
[4808.96s -> 4812.16s]  and then you can watch them at the remastered German.
[4812.16s -> 4815.52s]  Holy shit that sounds like a fucking brilliant goddamn idea.
[4815.52s -> 4817.28s]  It actually does.
[4817.28s -> 4822.17s]  We we should pick out like three of everybody's favorite videos we've ever done
[4822.17s -> 4824.25s]  and try to remake.
[4824.25s -> 4827.93s]  Oh yeah that sounds fucking incredible.
[4827.93s -> 4830.57s]  And then we'll we'll like we'll premiere them on stream
[4831.90s -> 4833.98s]  and see if they're as good as the original.
[4836.43s -> 4839.31s]  Yeah I bet we could do that with that damned one.
[4839.31s -> 4840.51s]  I can't even remember the name of it.
[4842.19s -> 4844.91s]  Breakfast time with goofus and doofus or something whatever the title was.
[4846.35s -> 4848.59s]  You want to try to remaster an old video.
[4848.59s -> 4851.08s]  That's actually weird enough to be funny.
[4851.08s -> 4851.64s]  Let's do it.
[4851.64s -> 4852.52s]  All right write that down.
[4852.52s -> 4853.32s]  We'll we'll we'll get that.
[4853.32s -> 4854.44s]  I'm writing that down.
[4854.44s -> 4857.85s]  I'll put it right underneath among us.
[4857.85s -> 4859.88s]  All right that's that sounds like fun.
[4860.44s -> 4861.64s]  Uh I'm gonna get going.
[4861.64s -> 4865.82s]  I don't know if you're sticking around but if you are then are you gonna keep going?
[4865.82s -> 4871.02s]  Uh I may play like Guilty Gear until the PC gaming show.
[4871.02s -> 4871.42s]  Okay.
[4871.42s -> 4872.46s]  But just fill time.

[4885.45s -> 4886.17s]  I'm gonna get going.
[4886.17s -> 4892.43s]  If if you just fair warning if you send people over here we might I don't know.

[4894.27s -> 4899.39s]  I like honestly just like just hang out and be the last time you hang out.
[4899.39s -> 4903.15s]  I said this too it's something about being hosted.
[4903.15s -> 4909.18s]  The expectation that everyone brings over to you makes me very uncomfortable.
[4909.18s -> 4911.58s]  All right so we won't raid you.
[4911.58s -> 4913.18s]  We'll we'll say goodbye.

[4937.42s -> 4938.78s]  Like with just no pressure.
[4938.78s -> 4943.90s]  It's not a number it's the the expectation of content.
[4943.90s -> 4944.22s]  Okay.
[4944.22s -> 4949.52s]  Coming from you to me is like I I it doesn't matter how many people there are.
[4949.52s -> 4951.20s]  I know I'm disappointing them all.
[4951.20s -> 4953.12s]  All right well then I'm not going to raid you.
[4953.12s -> 4958.88s]  I then I'm just you're giving such an extraordinary strange circumstance.
[4958.88s -> 4960.80s]  No no no no no you're giving expectations.
[4963.23s -> 4966.19s]  Life is about overcoming expectations.
[4966.19s -> 4968.83s]  So you have to do it to help me.
[4968.83s -> 4975.48s]  Okay so everybody be aware stir is not going to produce any content apparently.
[4975.48s -> 4976.36s]  But what do you mean content.

[4979.00s -> 4980.36s]  That is content.
[4980.36s -> 4982.68s]  But like that's you're not expected to do anything else.
[4982.68s -> 4984.76s]  You don't have to like do a magic show for everybody.
[4984.76s -> 4986.52s]  But there's no E3 for another hour.
[4986.52s -> 4989.16s]  Am I supposed to be an entertaining person on my own.

[5064.67s -> 5065.87s]  That's probably the number one thing.
[5066.86s -> 5070.06s]  I'm kind of interested in the nothing else.
[5070.06s -> 5072.70s]  I don't think I can't think of anything.

[5090.40s -> 5092.80s]  I've been doing this for 10 years.
[5092.80s -> 5094.56s]  I'm a 35 year old man.
[5094.56s -> 5099.07s]  Started my YouTube channel June 11th 2011.
[5099.07s -> 5100.80s]  It's been a fucking long time.
[5105.15s -> 5110.25s]  I I do people don't watch TV shows for more than five 10 years.
[5110.25s -> 5112.73s]  So it's shocking that 10 years later people still watch.
[5113.53s -> 5116.32s]  It's remarkable to me.
[5116.32s -> 5117.68s]  And especially considering that.
[5117.68s -> 5119.92s]  I'm looking at the view count number right now.
[5121.68s -> 5123.92s]  People keep coming here.
[5123.92s -> 5127.47s]  And I hope you like the stream.
[5128.19s -> 5128.99s]  I don't want to.
[5129.87s -> 5131.55s]  Here's the thing that I don't want to ever have happen.
[5133.04s -> 5135.53s]  The more that that number goes up.
[5135.53s -> 5139.85s]  I don't want to have myself be like oh shit.
[5139.85s -> 5142.11s]  20,000 30,000 okay.
[5142.11s -> 5142.59s]  What do I do?
[5142.59s -> 5143.07s]  I gotta be good.
[5143.07s -> 5143.55s]  I gotta be funny.
[5143.55s -> 5144.59s]  Like Star was just saying right.
[5146.76s -> 5148.28s]  I gotta try to keep grounded.
[5148.28s -> 5150.03s]  Because the more that I see people come in.
[5150.03s -> 5151.23s]  The more that I want to.
[5151.23s -> 5153.56s]  I just want to stay the same.
[5153.56s -> 5154.92s]  I don't want to like do anything different.
[5157.02s -> 5158.54s]  That's something that I'm concerned about.
[5158.54s -> 5160.96s]  Because when you look over and you see that it's just like oh fuck.
[5160.96s -> 5162.80s]  Why are there this many people here?
[5164.25s -> 5166.01s]  He's retiring.
[5166.01s -> 5166.99s]  Not yet.
[5166.99s -> 5167.63s]  Not yet.
[5167.63s -> 5168.43s]  Not yet.
[5168.43s -> 5169.15s]  Relax.
[5169.15s -> 5171.60s]  Not yet.
[5171.60s -> 5172.48s]  Yeah.
[5172.48s -> 5174.64s]  Thanks for uh thanks for sticking with this channel for this long.
[5174.64s -> 5177.92s]  It's been a very long time and I'm surprised every day.
[5177.92s -> 5181.32s]  We'll see how much further it goes.
[5181.32s -> 5183.64s]  We'll see how how it does right.
[5183.64s -> 5184.92s]  I don't have any expectations.
[5184.92s -> 5185.48s]  I never did.
[5186.04s -> 5187.32s]  So I'm just going to keep going.
[5187.32s -> 5189.79s]  Thanks a lot.
[5189.79s -> 5196.94s]  Hope I can continue to do the things you want to see.
[5196.94s -> 5197.50s]  I watch.
[5197.50s -> 5197.98s]  I watch.
[5197.98s -> 5198.38s]  I watch.
[5198.38s -> 5199.47s]  Thank you.
[5199.47s -> 5200.83s]  So uh very important though.
[5200.83s -> 5206.97s]  Tomorrow I am going to be live on Ms. Kip's channel.
[5206.97s -> 5210.09s]  I'm going to be on OTK Schooled.
[5210.09s -> 5212.88s]  I'm going to be a contestant on that stream.
[5212.88s -> 5218.20s]  So if you want to see me tomorrow uh potentially embarrass myself completely.
[5218.20s -> 5223.72s]  With uh not being able to answer what like 10 times like 30 is or something.
[5223.72s -> 5224.60s]  I've been practicing.
[5224.60s -> 5225.64s]  I'm hoping I can be good.
[5226.91s -> 5227.39s]  I'm ready.

[5239.87s -> 5241.31s]  I can't get eliminated in kindergarten.
[5241.31s -> 5243.95s]  That would be so awful.
[5243.95s -> 5247.95s]  People make that joke but I can't get eliminated in like the first grade.
[5247.95s -> 5249.63s]  I would never live that down.
[5249.63s -> 5255.76s]  I've been panicking about it for the last like four days.
[5255.76s -> 5257.04s]  All right let's raid stir.

[5293.39s -> 5297.15s]  I really hope that like everybody's like as stupid as I could be.
[5297.15s -> 5298.11s]  You know what I mean?
[5298.11s -> 5300.43s]  I don't want to be the first person out.
