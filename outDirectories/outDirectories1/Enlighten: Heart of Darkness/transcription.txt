[0.31s -> 11.59s]  Hey, what's going on everybody? Jerma here with another episode of
[11.59s -> 16.85s]  ENLIGHTEN. The series, of course, where I go back in time, look at a title that was
[16.85s -> 20.69s]  overlooked by a lot of people. Well, maybe not so much overlooked by people, but a
[20.69s -> 26.03s]  title that fell through the cracks and nobody really talks about anymore. So this
[26.03s -> 30.37s]  time I'm going to talk about Heart of Darkness. No, not the book. This has
[30.37s -> 33.87s]  nothing to do with the book. It's got the same name though. It's gone
[33.87s -> 38.71s]  funny. So the guy responsible for this game, his name is Eric Shahee, and he's
[38.71s -> 43.63s]  sort of the grandfather of cinematic storytelling in video games. Eric Shahee
[43.63s -> 47.43s]  is the guy that made Another World, and if you type Another World into Google,
[47.43s -> 51.60s]  you're gonna find a million different articles on this guy. And if it wasn't
[51.60s -> 56.92s]  for guys like Eric Shahee, we would probably be stuck still in the press A to
[56.92s -> 62.20s]  jump, press B to shoot, kill the boss at the end of the game type gameplay. But
[62.20s -> 66.56s]  let's start talking about Heart of Darkness. Gonna do this in review style
[66.56s -> 83.70s]  just like in the last video. So what do you say? We go back in time, space, the
[83.70s -> 88.78s]  infinite journey. These are the stories... No, that's not how this works. This is
[88.78s -> 94.52s]  Heart of Darkness, a game so full of imagination that it couldn't even handle
[94.52s -> 100.70s]  itself. Releasing in 1998 under the now defunct Interplay, Heart of Darkness is
[100.70s -> 105.38s]  the definition of development and publishing struggles. The game saw many
[105.38s -> 109.70s]  many different delays. Mostly it was to create the game's many cutscenes and
[109.70s -> 114.02s]  pre-rendered backgrounds. Not to mention the bidding war that went between a
[114.02s -> 117.58s]  bunch of different companies on who was actually going to distribute this game.
[117.58s -> 122.35s]  For all these shortcomings though, the game did do quite well. Over a million
[122.35s -> 127.12s]  copies sold. Now that's quite a success for any game company's standards. So what
[127.12s -> 130.28s]  happened to this game? How come you don't really hear about it? How come nobody
[130.32s -> 135.88s]  cares about it? It's because of Ocarina of Time. Ocarina of Time, Banjo-Kazooie, and
[135.88s -> 141.88s]  Resident Evil 2 all released in this same year and Banjo-Kazooie actually
[141.88s -> 147.08s]  released one day before Heart of Darkness. So what's a big uphill battle?
[147.08s -> 151.40s]  Especially Ocarina of Time. Ocarina of Time is considered one of the best games
[151.40s -> 156.36s]  ever created. So when your game is going up against those types of games, you're
[156.44s -> 164.06s]  in a little bit of trouble. Heart of Darkness is about a young boy named
[164.06s -> 168.30s]  Andy, a young middle schooler with an authority problem. After getting in
[168.30s -> 172.42s]  trouble at school in what seems to be a regular occurrence, Andy meets up with
[172.42s -> 176.50s]  his faithful companion, Whiskey. After a strange eclipse sucks away his dog
[176.50s -> 181.22s]  companion, Andy rushes home to start his journey of rescue. The story is pretty
[181.22s -> 192.41s]  cut and dry, but it can be cute in the right places. The cutscenes in the game
[192.41s -> 198.13s]  are very, very interesting. They always start and always end in gameplay. It can
[198.13s -> 201.89s]  be something as simple as talking to your dog or dropping you in front of a
[201.89s -> 205.53s]  50-foot monster that's about to eat off your face. And this is something that
[205.53s -> 210.17s]  Heart of Darkness does very, very well. They give you a sense of urgency. You
[210.21s -> 213.21s]  have to pay attention to the cutscenes because if you don't, if you get up and
[213.21s -> 216.65s]  go get a soda somewhere, you're gonna sit back down and be dead over and over
[216.65s -> 220.49s]  again. And these cutscenes are really, really streamlined. Sometimes you don't
[220.49s -> 224.53s]  even know they're happening. It's a fantastic mechanic that really should be
[224.53s -> 228.21s]  the norm for the industry. More people need to take a page out of the Half-Life
[228.21s -> 232.13s]  book and have cutscenes and have cinematics be part of the experience
[232.13s -> 238.74s]  rather than just be something you load and watch. So gameplay-wise, Heart of
[238.74s -> 242.90s]  Darkness plays just like the other Eric Shahee games. In most situations, you are
[242.90s -> 246.58s]  going to be jumping on platforms, climbing on walls, or solving strange
[246.58s -> 252.02s]  puzzles. Difficulty-wise, this game is on an incredibly difficult scale. The
[252.02s -> 255.98s]  controls are very difficult to get used to, and at points the game is just
[255.98s -> 263.24s]  unfair. Your only real means of defense is a wonky laser beam gun and a magical
[263.24s -> 268.44s]  green goo attack. So what I'm trying to say is, you are going to die in this game
[268.44s -> 276.12s]  over and over and over and over again. So prime your wall to be ready for a
[276.12s -> 280.88s]  controller to go through it. And it can be also said that Heart of Darkness has
[280.88s -> 286.32s]  some very, very graphic death animations. You get ripped apart, you get squished,
[286.32s -> 294.47s]  you get crushed. There are a lot of terrible ways to die in this game. The
[294.47s -> 299.49s]  game is also very, very short, spanning two discs. It only takes about two and a
[299.49s -> 303.45s]  half hours to beat the entire game. Most of the room is taken up by, of course,
[303.45s -> 307.93s]  the cutscenes, 30 minutes of them on both discs. But if you can take the stress of
[307.93s -> 312.01s]  the gameplay and you don't mind watching a cutscene every now and then, this game
[312.01s -> 318.77s]  has to be played. Eric Shahee has created a fantastic game, and I am so glad that
[318.77s -> 323.61s]  he got back into the industry. He created that new game from Dust. That is an Eric
[323.61s -> 327.69s]  Shahee game, so it's great to see him getting back into it after so long. But
[327.69s -> 331.17s]  that's going to wrap up this episode of Enlighten, guys. Thank you so much for
[331.17s -> 334.89s]  watching. I really do appreciate it. And go check out this game, if you have a
[334.89s -> 343.56s]  chance. So thank you, everybody. I will see you all next time. Take care, everybody.
