[2.74s -> 7.51s]  There's only so fast you can move with a full hot coffee in your hand.
[7.51s -> 20.74s]  I have a hot coffee. I was downstairs, and my staircase, by the way, is like eight stories.
[21.46s -> 31.02s]  I have to go around the fucking pool. God, that's annoying. Over by the playground,
[31.02s -> 36.47s]  the slide that goes down from the top floor all the way to the bottom. I don't know why I made it
[36.47s -> 45.98s]  like this. Can't use the elevator because it's out of service. That's fucking annoying. Like a Willy
[45.98s -> 51.19s]  Wonka house. Yeah, but there's only so fast. I've like, I'm half-winded because I had to
[51.19s -> 58.78s]  move so quickly up the stairs. My eight story house. Let me tweet this out. Hold on. I'm not
[58.78s -> 104.50s]  late. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. It was 12.01. All right, give me one sec. Okay, so today we're
[104.50s -> 117.14s]  gonna play The Sims 1. It's been a very long time since I've played this game. The Sims 1 what? The
[117.22s -> 126.07s]  Sims 1 won. Actually, it's the complete edition. What is half of the stuff in this game?
[126.07s -> 141.53s]  It's like a magician town. What is the magic? What's magic town? I have everything. How tall
[141.53s -> 156.57s]  are you, 5'8"? This chair seems like it's way too high. That's better. Okay. Did you guys hear that?
[163.99s -> 167.35s]  All right, so yeah, I'm welcome. This is once a week Andy here.
[168.65s -> 174.81s]  We might go two times here, depending on how much fun The Sims 1 is today and tomorrow.
[175.69s -> 190.92s]  You're gonna do face cam? Nah. No, not today. Would you play Zack? Wait, what was that? I play Zack
[190.92s -> 198.62s]  in Wiki. I don't know why I would play the game Zack and I'm not sure why I would need to Wikipedia
[198.62s -> 211.64s]  everything, but it must be a hard game. All right, let's go. Yeah, don't leave. I'm leaving. Don't,
[211.64s -> 215.96s]  don't leave. Don't, what was that? Why am I doing that? Don't, don't leave. Don't leave.
[217.21s -> 224.55s]  Putting on like a Boston thing. All right, it's been a very long time. I can't, I'm very excited
[224.55s -> 234.06s]  to play The Sims 1 with all of you. How are you feeling? I am very tight, very sore. Did some
[234.06s -> 242.28s]  stuff this week. Did some medical stuff this week and we tried something new and I kind of, I kind
[242.28s -> 250.49s]  of got like the shit kicked out of me, if I'm honest with you. Essentially, I let, I did the
[250.49s -> 254.17s]  equivalent of lying down on the ground and somebody just slowly running me over with their car.
[254.89s -> 267.82s]  That's kind of how it feels. Just very slowly, just the wheel going up over my back and then all
[267.82s -> 272.46s]  the way across and then over and the shock absorption of the car goes like boom, boom.
[273.18s -> 280.84s]  It sounds nice. Well, I didn't do that. That's what it felt, that's what it feels like right now.
[283.38s -> 285.70s]  He's doing suede science for his pain.
[290.57s -> 295.13s]  No, I would have to make a YouTube video where I explain that. See, you don't need, but guys,
[295.13s -> 299.29s]  the tire tracks, they have the groove that fits right into where your spine is
[300.63s -> 309.14s]  and what happens is it unlocks an area right in your T6, T7. The guy lies down
[309.94s -> 318.66s]  on his face down, just love his head down. He's talking into the ground and his microphone's
[318.66s -> 325.82s]  going like because he's moving around too much. The car's going to drive over me enough.
[326.46s -> 331.16s]  You get like all these horrible crunches. Well, it's like the dude's mom.
[331.88s -> 338.44s]  He's hanging out the window. Hey, are you sure you want to do this? I don't think this is safe.
[344.76s -> 354.89s]  He died. No, he didn't. He said suede wrong. I know I say, look, I like it. It sounds fun to me.
[355.53s -> 363.45s]  I like the way it sounds better. Suede science. Pseudo science sounds, I don't know, like real.
[363.45s -> 370.41s]  Suede science sounds, I like the way it sounds better. Who's Peter Griffin? Look, look, I know,
[370.41s -> 374.89s]  I know. I'm from New England and I have a New England accent and I'm like, I've turned into
[374.89s -> 379.29s]  like a fat guy. I wear glasses and I eat like fucking Cheetos and I have a dog. Okay. I must,
[379.29s -> 382.41s]  I may as well be Peter Griffin. I do a lot of referential humor too. It must be Peter Griffin.
[382.41s -> 395.69s]  I am. All right, let's play the sim. You heard? You guys ready? You guys ready? Oh shit, hold on.
[395.69s -> 408.14s]  This is kind of loud for me. And ta-da. Here we are in Sims 1.
[410.28s -> 416.89s]  Oh, this was a pain in the ass to get to work. To get this to be on your screen was,
[416.89s -> 425.16s]  I don't know why it was the hardest thing I've ever done. So I have to make a family and I know
[425.16s -> 429.64s]  you can go into like the bitmap editor and stuff, but I, I don't want to do, I want to play with
[429.64s -> 438.04s]  just the default sim. It's 180p. Yeah. Well the game broadcasted itself to your screen in like 360p.
[438.68s -> 445.48s]  This isn't the one for the NES. They made, really didn't. Is the goth family,
[445.48s -> 451.98s]  for those who don't remember. All right, let's, let's make a family. It doesn't, making a family
[451.98s -> 459.66s]  in the Sims 1 does not take very long at all. Oh shit, this is important. Oh, what last name?
[460.46s -> 476.98s]  What do you think? Sweets. Sweets family. I don't know why I think that's cool. The Sweets. I like
[476.98s -> 485.29s]  it actually. Not the Elbritans, no. The Griffins. I'm not making the Griffin family. You can't make
[485.29s -> 500.66s]  any, you can't even make that. Greens. The Andes. No. You want me to make Andy? No, it's got to be
[500.66s -> 523.38s]  new. New characters. New characters. How about the Gaslighters? Uh, Sway, the Swaydos? Swaydos.
[523.38s -> 538.17s]  Swaydoos? The Swaydoos. That's way too like, that's too comedic. I don't know. I don't know
[538.17s -> 543.77s]  what's jumping out to me is Arthur Sweets. Arthur Sweets. I don't know why. That's doing it for me
[543.77s -> 562.57s]  today. Arthur Sweets. Arthur and Jane Sweets. I got it. How do I do this? Okay, this is Arthur Sweets.
[563.13s -> 571.90s]  I forgot that the Sims 1 was, this is, this is it. You just make, you, you give them like a head and
[571.90s -> 579.59s]  then you change their t-shirt. I forgot how little it was in this game. You can go in and paint stuff,
[579.59s -> 587.45s]  right? Like a Minecraft character, but I'm not going to do that. There's so many. All right,
[587.45s -> 602.47s]  so let's go with Arthur Sweets here. This is scripted. What are you talking about? Make him
[602.47s -> 609.00s]  the Joker. That's, that's the Joker's name? No, it's not. What's the Joker's name in the Joker?
[609.00s -> 620.49s]  Arthur what? Arthur Fleck. Arthur Sweets. Just because somebody's name is Arthur doesn't mean
[620.49s -> 629.10s]  they're the Joker. All right, let's do, uh, let's get it like this. Let's do outgoing. We want a lot
[629.10s -> 637.99s]  of friends. Not active at all and very neat because I don't like it when they throw this
[637.99s -> 644.10s]  shit on the ground. Well, how can you be outgoing and not nice? Outgoing and not nice or playful?
[644.10s -> 650.39s]  Is there like mean outgoing? I thought outgoing meant you actively wanted people to be your friend
[650.39s -> 657.11s]  and stuff. Is it outgoing evil? Like you just, is that the guy that like talks shit to you and
[657.11s -> 662.20s]  cuts you off and stuff? Is it the guy that like cuts you in the ice cream line and like gives you
[662.20s -> 665.64s]  the finger? That's like a different kind of outgoing. You're outgoingly mean. All right,
[665.64s -> 678.31s]  well, no, I don't want that. That's fine. I don't want to be that neat. I don't want to be that
[678.31s -> 703.35s]  nice either. All right, that looks good. Arthur Sweets, uh, bio for Arthur Sweets. Okay, that's
[703.35s -> 713.00s]  Arthur Sweets. The family member here. Do we have a kid? Wait, I didn't even pick Arthur Sweets.
[713.00s -> 716.52s]  I didn't even pick his body. What, who is he? I didn't even click him. What was he?
[719.98s -> 728.58s]  Okay, wait, I can edit it, right? It's the Joker. It is the Joker. Whatever.
[729.83s -> 739.27s]  Keep it. I don't care. Damn it. All right. Look, there's only, how many options are there? Total
[739.27s -> 747.19s]  one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.
[747.19s -> 757.13s]  There's like only 30 heads in the whole game. This is Jane Sweets. This is going to be Harley
[757.13s -> 760.73s]  Quinn, isn't it? No, it's not. I'm going to make sure that doesn't happen. What is Harley Quinn's
[760.73s -> 765.51s]  name? Oh, wait, it's Harley Quinn. I mean, like, does she have like a, whatever.
[776.30s -> 793.64s]  Arlene Quinn. What is this? Oh, okay. It's like, what is that? Make the Elbertsons. Look,
[793.64s -> 797.80s]  there can be like 40 families in here. Let me just get in and do the, remember how to play the game.
[798.52s -> 810.26s]  I don't know why I like this. You know what I mean? There's something about it. I feel like
[810.26s -> 814.44s]  this lady is going to start singing. I'm going to break in a song halfway through the stream.
[814.44s -> 832.10s]  It's Princess Fiona. What is, what's the song that Fiona sings? All right. Well,
[832.10s -> 875.94s]  Jane's going to be way more active than Arthur. The active one. Um, like this, right?
[876.74s -> 884.38s]  Why does everybody have so many hashtags in their fucking thing now? Everybody's doing this now.
[895.16s -> 919.98s]  I'm like a scientist. Wait till people start doing this. Okay. That's, that looks good to me.
[919.98s -> 940.94s]  All right. It looks good to me. Let's go. They have a child. This is going to be, uh, Sean Sweets.
[940.94s -> 953.90s]  Ben Sweets. Boris Sweets. I like, I kind of like Boris Sweets, but the S's together. Andy Sweets.
[953.90s -> 962.17s]  Johnny Sweets. Peter Sweets. I like that. Nathan Sweets. That's not bad. All right,
[962.17s -> 968.12s]  hold on. What if, oh my God. I, it's perfect. It's, it's, it's absolutely perfect. Whatever
[968.68s -> 984.58s]  it's going to be. It's perfect. Not Meg. No. Car, uh, Caramel Sweets. And I'm not changing anything.
[984.58s -> 1004.63s]  It's perfect. Caramel Sweets. Not Martha Sweets. Caramel Sweets. Not Meg. Stop saying Meg. You guys
[1004.63s -> 1010.82s]  hate Family Guy. Nobody here likes Family Guy. I know why we ironically hate it all together,
[1010.82s -> 1014.66s]  right? But like I'm not, I'm not going to make every character like Peter and like Lois and like
[1014.66s -> 1030.81s]  Chris Griffin. That's what Virgo is? Wait, hold on. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait.
[1030.81s -> 1044.20s]  I gotta see if this is accurate. That's not accurate at all. Yeah, that's more accurate.
[1044.84s -> 1056.09s]  All right. I'm way, that's me. Yeah, that's me. That's me. People are giving so many subs. What
[1056.09s -> 1061.69s]  the fuck is going on? Freddie Dredge just gave 50 community subs. 50. On top of like the 8,000 he's
[1061.69s -> 1069.86s]  given in the last two, three years. Holy shit, dude. Absolute disrespect of what? What? I, I,
[1069.86s -> 1076.01s]  I didn't, I didn't say Virgo's stupid. I said Virgo's not me. I said that's inaccurate. I didn't
[1076.01s -> 1084.07s]  say that's dumb. Uh, thank you, Freddie. Seriously. And there was a shitload more. Unionize Your
[1084.07s -> 1091.77s]  Workplace, Georgie Porgy, Knights of Old, Straight Pube, and Hole of One Zombie. Thanks, guys.
[1092.41s -> 1097.13s]  A lot of subs. It's not pre-recorded. No, it's not. Why would, why would, it's not pre-recorded. I'm
[1097.13s -> 1103.22s]  here. I'm literally in front of you right now. What time were you born? I don't want to answer
[1103.22s -> 1108.95s]  that fucking weird question. You're going to, because you're going to go back in time. And
[1109.03s -> 1114.79s]  here's the thing. You know, oh, what if you go back in time and like snatch me when I'm a baby
[1114.79s -> 1117.43s]  or something? I don't want you, I don't want you to know what, where that, what time that was.
[1123.03s -> 1127.27s]  Yeah. If you go back in time to the day that I was born and you go like to the hospitals where
[1127.27s -> 1132.50s]  you think I was born, you do, you need, you still need to know the time. I ain't telling you that.
[1132.50s -> 1145.48s]  Good luck. What was the temperature when you were born? You know what? That's funny. That probably
[1145.48s -> 1152.57s]  actually matters somehow. That's going to be like, what if, what if my, my ice sign is, right?
[1152.57s -> 1159.10s]  I could be like fire or ice. I wouldn't be surprised. Okay. What is, what's this bar for?
[1166.12s -> 1172.09s]  I don't care. All right. We have Arthur Jane and caramel sweets. I don't think we need anybody else.
[1172.65s -> 1176.25s]  When you have more than three Sims in a Sims game, that's how you start to lose interest
[1176.25s -> 1179.85s]  because everybody has to be taken care of and you can't pay attention to anybody.
[1179.85s -> 1183.53s]  So half the people end up like dying and shit because you can only even focus on one person.
[1187.69s -> 1194.18s]  So where are they going to go? Are you sure? I am sure you're a Sims expert.
[1194.82s -> 1202.18s]  There are the sweets. They have $20,000 and they're going to move that family.
[1202.98s -> 1206.73s]  All right. Should I buy a lot or should I just kick out somebody? This is starter home.
[1207.37s -> 1225.88s]  Sims one is notoriously hard and bad with the file meters. Get a good house. Um, this is pet paradise.
[1227.10s -> 1234.97s]  I have a 10 sim lane. This is a good one to own. Build my own. All right. 14,500 to spend on
[1234.97s -> 1247.74s]  household. All right. Let's go here. Let's buy this house. I'll build it. School bus will arrive in
[1247.74s -> 1257.88s]  an hour. Why? I don't want a school bus to arrive in an hour. Is she reading the newspaper?
[1260.49s -> 1265.43s]  This girl can't even read. All right. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[1265.43s -> 1273.29s]  Oh, that's a classic caramel sweets. She's the smart one of the family. All right. Let's build.
[1275.72s -> 1281.16s]  That was absolutely the intro. That was absolutely the season one, episode one pilot
[1281.16s -> 1292.22s]  of introducing these characters. Oh, well, that was a perfect start. And then halfway through season
[1292.22s -> 1297.58s]  two, we stopped as directors and writers and animators. We stopped. We stopped making her
[1297.58s -> 1307.26s]  smart because that's like too much work and like annoying to do now. Okay. Um, what do I want to do?
[1307.26s -> 1321.06s]  What kind of house do I want? I'm just going to go with this. Just a regular house. I'm so bad at
[1321.06s -> 1327.61s]  this part. This is why I always have pre-built stuff because I'm too stupid to do it on my own.
[1327.61s -> 1332.92s]  When I close my eyes, I can see a beautiful thing. I can exactly see how the architecture looks. I
[1332.92s -> 1337.38s]  can see where the roof is. I can see like a family opening the door and a dog jumping up and
[1337.38s -> 1341.64s]  everything. I can see this in my head right now. But when I try to make that, I just make a cube.
[1341.64s -> 1362.44s]  Yeah. I like this view better. I don't like the other side. This would be the living room.
[1362.44s -> 1375.32s]  I'm down a little more because I want a garden too. How much money do I have? 12,000. And by the way,
[1375.32s -> 1387.58s]  no cheating. All right. So that's the front door. I'm not done. This is just the first part. Why is
[1387.58s -> 1396.39s]  that so funny? This isn't even funny. This is the foundation of the house. Why is this funny? This
[1396.39s -> 1403.32s]  is not even funny. Okay. Then over here, it will go like this. It's going to be like the bathroom.
[1403.32s -> 1420.98s]  This is not even funny. Okay. That's like going to be a bathroom. And then over here, I like a
[1420.98s -> 1430.25s]  kitchen. Okay. Wait, wait, wait. Shh. Here's the little patio. Walk away. Door. Go in the door.
[1430.25s -> 1437.83s]  There's your kitchen. No. There's your kitchen. Kitchen's right here. And living room here.
[1437.83s -> 1447.19s]  I want an open concept. This will be a bathroom. And then the bedroom will be over here. Yes. This
[1447.19s -> 1466.22s]  house is fucked up. Why is this house fucked up? Is this the bedroom? Because there's nothing over
[1466.22s -> 1472.23s]  here yet. Holy shit. What? You forgot the foundation. Well, I have to do, hold on. Floor.
[1472.23s -> 1484.47s]  Well, this is going to be a combo. I think a Zerkoff room. I don't know why I was just about
[1484.47s -> 1490.62s]  to answer this with what I was about to say. And I'm not going to, no, I'm not even going to say
[1490.62s -> 1506.22s]  that. Say something. What con, nevermind. I was going to say what constitutes a Zerkoff room?
[1506.22s -> 1515.93s]  What are you talking about? That you don't go on like a tour, like a house or an apartment or
[1515.93s -> 1520.41s]  something. You're walking around. Okay. So this is the bathroom. This is a, it's a full bath.
[1520.41s -> 1523.77s]  And over here we, it's really nice that they have a walk-in shower. Really cool.
[1523.77s -> 1528.18s]  Here's the living room. Yeah. It's about, it's about like 600 square feet in here.
[1528.18s -> 1532.97s]  Oh, this, this, this is the Zerkoff room. Yep. This one here. Oh, nice. Very, very, very nice.
[1532.97s -> 1538.62s]  Honey, what do you think of the Zerkoff room? Oh yeah. This is great. It's got extra privacy.
[1538.62s -> 1542.22s]  Yeah. This is good. There's two doors. As you see, there's one door that locks and there's another
[1542.22s -> 1552.84s]  door in front. Just in case somebody gets in the first one. Oh, that's so useful. Yeah. Because
[1552.84s -> 1556.36s]  I'll be able to hear somebody open the first one. So then I could freak out and just like
[1557.96s -> 1561.96s]  freak out and just stop like, and then stand there like a toy soldier, like nothing was happening.
[1561.96s -> 1567.82s]  By the time they get to the second one, I'm just standing there. But if you go in the Zerkoff room,
[1567.82s -> 1572.41s]  you're not, what else would you be doing in there? Why would you need privacy in the,
[1572.41s -> 1579.03s]  people know what you're doing in there. It's not like it's, people wouldn't know.
[1581.00s -> 1590.89s]  Airlock. Whoa. What is this? Oh, this is wood. No, wood floors are fucking overrated.
[1590.89s -> 1596.06s]  I'm sorry. They get scuffed up. They get destroyed. They get broken. They're fucking
[1596.06s -> 1602.22s]  incredibly expensive. Respectful. Expensive. Wood floors are so expensive and they just,
[1602.22s -> 1611.46s]  they get beat up and stuff. I don't know. I mean, they look really nice. If you love wood, then
[1611.46s -> 1619.43s]  sure. It's a, they have tons to take. You have to upkeep the hell out of them. I don't want
[1619.43s -> 1636.73s]  a carpet in here. Oh, who wants to? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Excuse me. Tile gang.
[1636.73s -> 1649.26s]  Ooh, this is swanky. Basic wood, Andy. Well, I like that. This is my house. I get to do whatever
[1649.26s -> 1655.86s]  I want. Okay. You can have, you can, hey, you can go and get this. You can do the Sims one.
[1656.50s -> 1660.18s]  You can go and do the painful, horrible installation process and desperately trying
[1660.18s -> 1664.42s]  to get it to turn on on Windows 10 and trying to figure out how to get it to fucking run
[1664.98s -> 1670.26s]  and have to pull it through a like DirectX pass through program to get it to like actually show
[1670.26s -> 1683.00s]  up on the screen. And then you can make your own house. You can run it in compatibility mode.
[1683.00s -> 1692.94s]  Ooh, what's this? I don't like that. Oh, yep. No, ugly. Ooh, what's this? Moss? This is kind of
[1692.94s -> 1705.77s]  like Minecraft. That's a Minecraft house. No, I don't want that. How do I sell castle floor?
[1705.77s -> 1714.66s]  Is this a rug? This is the Sims one. It may as well be Minecraft floors and walls and stuff.
[1714.66s -> 1724.23s]  It's not that complicated. All right. I'm going to go with this. This is my kitchen area. It's
[1724.23s -> 1736.84s]  like, give me a headache looking at it. Yeah. It gives me a headache. I don't like it. How do
[1736.84s -> 1745.56s]  I delete things? How do I get my money back? A contractor finishes the last tile and you walk
[1745.56s -> 1752.95s]  in. How do I get my money? How do I delete this and get my money back? How do I remove that?
[1752.95s -> 1768.98s]  Control area. Okay. Wait. Oh my God. What? You don't get the full price back? No, you don't.
[1768.98s -> 1773.70s]  Okay. I have to be really careful then. I need, I wish I could see what this looks like. This is
[1773.70s -> 1784.44s]  all right. No, it's the same color as the balls. Ooh, here we go. That's going to look cool. All
[1784.44s -> 1789.03s]  right. I'm done. It looks dirty. It needs to be washed. It doesn't matter. I'm too, it's too
[1789.03s -> 1799.99s]  late. What about here? This is the living room floors. Should I just do wood to just be fucking
[1800.79s -> 1822.60s]  wood? No, I don't hate this. Red, red, red. Oh, blue. Yeah. I like that. I like this too. I like
[1822.60s -> 1831.88s]  this one better. Do I like this or do I not like this? Okay. The part of my brain, it's at the
[1831.88s -> 1838.22s]  crossroads where it doesn't know if I hate this or if I love it. It's right at the crossroads and
[1838.22s -> 1848.42s]  it hasn't picked a door yet. You guys ever get like that? This is why I need everything pre-built
[1848.42s -> 1855.75s]  and done for me. I'm so indecisive. I'm so erratic. You have to just build this house
[1856.87s -> 1860.31s]  and sit me down in front of the Sims and be like, how's that look? And I'll go, well, it looks great.
[1860.87s -> 1865.11s]  Even if you, if you deliberately made a dog shit house and sat me down and told me, hey,
[1865.11s -> 1870.01s]  here's your house. What do you think? I'd be like, oh, cool. Oh, nice. I love it. I love the carpet.
[1870.57s -> 1886.46s]  Okay. That's that. What about, this is the bathroom. Weird, but okay. This is the bedroom. Wait,
[1886.46s -> 1902.74s]  where's the kid's sleep? I need to make a kid room. This is like a magic eye house. I can't wait to
[1902.74s -> 1907.86s]  like be sit on the ceiling looking down and just cross my eyes and like an elephant comes into view.
[1910.81s -> 1917.94s]  Carpet in the bathroom? This is not carpet, isn't it? I thought that's tile. I need a wallpaper.
[1917.94s -> 1936.34s]  Those walls up. This is just the first house. Relax. It's, I got like, I got all day. All right.
[1936.34s -> 1949.83s]  That was the worst part when you can't find that one piece of the house. Oh, come on. Where is it?
[1949.83s -> 1964.30s]  There it is. Why is Sims music goes so hard? Sims 1 really might be one of the best
[1964.30s -> 1971.88s]  gaming soundtracks ever. I really believe that. Okay. Wait, I didn't want to do this. Oh,
[1971.88s -> 1975.78s]  shit. I screwed it up. I want, what do I want for the kitchen? How about this?
[1976.66s -> 1985.08s]  Ooh, that's like a nice like sand in the kitchen. I like it. They're gonna be paintings and stuff.
[1985.08s -> 2006.81s]  Nobody said it's a pickle house. What are you talking about? Windows. Yeah, I'm just, hold on.
[2006.81s -> 2013.69s]  How is this a pickle? All right. Bathroom. I want the bathroom to really, really just pop
[2013.69s -> 2019.80s]  and be really cool. Let's do something, something wild, something wild. You know what I mean?
[2021.96s -> 2044.73s]  Like this. Oh yeah. That's wild. Love it. That's not the bathroom. Shit. What am I doing? Okay.
[2044.73s -> 2051.19s]  Well, I can fix that later. I'm just wasting so much money. Money is so valuable in The Sims 1 and
[2051.19s -> 2066.25s]  2. Where's this last piece? There we are. That's it, right? All right. Now this bedroom, let's do,
[2068.70s -> 2084.97s]  ooh, I kind of like this. This is a Russian grandma house. I can't laugh at this.
[2088.66s -> 2093.22s]  Okay. I know people are going to make me laugh today and I'm trying to not like, because somebody
[2093.22s -> 2098.74s]  said you're making the Among Us map. I don't even play it, but that's funny. I like know what that
[2098.74s -> 2115.88s]  is. Should I just make this Among Us? Oh, this is admin. I don't even know what admin does. I don't
[2115.88s -> 2123.48s]  know what admin is and it's not always that somebody's there getting in trouble. Okay. That's
[2123.48s -> 2131.37s]  a good start. This looks unfinished because it looks so stupid. Okay. I have 8,600 bucks. I need,
[2131.37s -> 2140.49s]  oh shit, I need doors. Men's room door. Should I have like a funny little, oh, there's like a,
[2142.98s -> 2149.77s]  look, it's like a public bathroom, but it's not. Do you need two public bathroom doors?
[2154.49s -> 2163.26s]  I hate it. What about the kid's room? I'll figure that out in a second. The kid sleeps in a crib.
[2164.22s -> 2182.41s]  No, nevermind. That's a baby. Ooh, is this a slider? No, it's not. I'm just, whatever,
[2182.41s -> 2192.78s]  just go with a standard basic door. No, that's a, that's the bathroom door. What's with all the
[2192.78s -> 2209.69s]  fucked up doors? Beach in door? Why do all these look like cartoon doors or hotel rooms? I just
[2209.69s -> 2218.60s]  want like a regular door. Celebrity security door? Wait, this is what we were just talking about.
[2218.60s -> 2229.43s]  It's a video game. All right, we're just going to go with the standard boring one. Now I just want
[2229.43s -> 2243.45s]  like an interior door. Office door. I forgot how ugly the Sims 1 stuff really could be.
[2243.45s -> 2260.39s]  Fancy door? Folk mountain door? I mean, Alpine snow door? These are all so weird.
[2268.22s -> 2276.15s]  All right, everyone, whatever. This is so boring, but I just need to get people into the house first.
[2276.15s -> 2288.28s]  Okay. All right, all right, all right, all right. Now we need windows. Zerk off room. Just we,
[2288.28s -> 2294.22s]  I don't have enough money to make the Zerk off room. All right. All right. So finally,
[2294.22s -> 2302.14s]  I gotta get appliances in here because I have to work in reverse. Appliances. So which
[2302.14s -> 2309.54s]  are we talking about refrigerators? Should I just pony up for the extremely expensive one?
[2309.54s -> 2321.86s]  Even this is a door. This is just a door. This is just a bureau. What the fuck? Never cold
[2321.86s -> 2340.90s]  food hold. Food hold? Why did I say it like that? Food hold? It's because of the rhyme. All right,
[2340.90s -> 2348.94s]  this is the standard one. This is fine. All right, how do I want this to play? You walk in here,
[2348.94s -> 2359.19s]  fridge always goes in the corner. That looks all right. What about stoves? Large appliances.
[2359.19s -> 2369.54s]  Here we go. Stove. No, this is a trash compactor. What do these things do? This kind of scares me.
[2369.54s -> 2376.09s]  So any of you trash compactor Andes, I have a question. Does this like crush the trash?
[2376.09s -> 2379.03s]  Do you put a bunch of trash in here and then you close the door and you press the button and it
[2379.03s -> 2386.95s]  like squishes it and crushes it? Isn't that like kind of scary? Like I feel like that would be
[2386.95s -> 2393.48s]  like scary. And then what? So you condense. So then what do you do with it after that?
[2393.48s -> 2398.55s]  Is it just crushed on the bottom? How do you get it out of there? What do you do with it?
[2401.40s -> 2405.72s]  They're dangerous. Yeah, but so what do you do? Just like, is there a bag in there?
[2405.72s -> 2411.00s]  So is there like a bag you put the trash into the bag and then it crushes the bag?
[2411.56s -> 2425.61s]  Like, how do you get it out of here? He doesn't know. What is this American shit? I don't know.
[2425.61s -> 2432.25s]  I'm asking. I don't have one of these. I've never seen one of these before. Are you pretending? No,
[2432.25s -> 2438.01s]  no. Like, look, I understand what it does. I'm asking like, is like, is there a bag or something
[2438.01s -> 2443.21s]  inside of this machine? Like, what do you do with it after it's crushed? What? How do you get it out?
[2449.16s -> 2460.18s]  In the bag? You don't. It's a video game. What? Hold on. Somebody said it. It crushes it with
[2460.18s -> 2464.42s]  the bag inside of there and it crushes the bag. When the bag break? Let's find out. I kind of
[2464.42s -> 2476.50s]  want to know. 375? Just put it outside. Whatever. Fuck it. I wouldn't be scared of it out there.
[2476.50s -> 2493.42s]  12 people have died from a trash compactor. What? Where's the stove? Should I get like a stand-up
[2493.42s -> 2497.50s]  stove? This is like a sink. Just put a barbecue in here.
[2502.25s -> 2516.81s]  Perfect. Why do I feel like a shitload of American dudes would rather this than having an actual
[2516.81s -> 2533.58s]  stove? Okay, I'm doing it. Fuck it. Let's go. I don't even want a stove. Okay, what about this?
[2533.58s -> 2538.62s]  All he would eat was just, Dad, I don't want to eat hamburgers, hot dogs, and Italian sausages
[2538.62s -> 2547.88s]  anymore. Hold on. The game is on. It's always a game on. You have every channel you watch
[2547.88s -> 2567.22s]  Japanese baseball. Yeah, there has to always be a game on. Always. Okay, that's fine. I mean,
[2567.22s -> 2571.93s]  it's probably not going to be fine eventually, but whatever. Oh, wait, wait, wait. What do you need?
[2571.93s -> 2576.17s]  You need a stove, you need a fridge, you need a... I need like a microwave. Oh, here we go. This is
[2576.17s -> 2596.14s]  good. I like that look. This over here. I need a table. This is so bad. Okay, tables. Just a little
[2596.14s -> 2621.18s]  one. Shit. This house is not big enough. There we go. I wanted to spin it. Spin it. Okay. It's like
[2621.18s -> 2625.26s]  the kitchen in an office. Yeah, kind of. There just needs to be a bunch of cabinets up here.
[2627.43s -> 2634.28s]  It's like a gross coffee maker that nobody uses because if you look in where the water goes,
[2634.28s -> 2646.31s]  it's rusted and fucking disgusting. No one turns it on. There's the one brave soul every maybe
[2646.31s -> 2653.74s]  once a week or two that is so desperate for coffee. A bunch of you in the room and you just hear the
[2653.74s -> 2659.02s]  person going, fuck, I need coffee so bad. And they start to turn it on and then they plug it in. It's
[2659.02s -> 2663.66s]  like, oh shit, this place is actually going to use the coffee maker in here. And they turn it on.
[2663.66s -> 2669.90s]  They're like, oh, how much should I put in there? And it starts to smell. The whole room smells like
[2669.90s -> 2675.82s]  that burnt, smelly old plastic smell. And everyone's just like, shit, dude. Oh, I don't
[2675.82s -> 2683.66s]  know if you should do that. Sometimes once every couple of weeks, once every like month or so,
[2683.66s -> 2692.57s]  someone will do that. I used the Keurig at my work and it tasted like death. Yeah. And here,
[2692.57s -> 2700.46s]  okay. Here's the thing. I'm going to give you a little bit of a rant here. For an office to have
[2701.34s -> 2706.38s]  like a $30 Mr. Coffee in the corner of the office room, of like the break room or something.
[2708.52s -> 2714.92s]  But like you, you gotta like, you got employees here. Don't you want your employees to be able
[2714.92s -> 2718.92s]  to get like awesome coffee? So they're like happy and they want to like work and shit.
[2720.12s -> 2724.52s]  You pony up for like the good one. Get like the good coffee maker that like
[2724.52s -> 2730.82s]  fucking cleans itself. And it looks like espresso and shit. Get one of those. People will be lined
[2730.82s -> 2735.91s]  up at the door, like get in there and get like a coffee in the morning. And you'll be, you can sit
[2735.91s -> 2738.95s]  like in your office and be like, all right, here they go. They're going to be all coffeeed up.
[2739.51s -> 2742.95s]  Anybody want a cream? You want cream? I will be running around the office
[2743.59s -> 2748.79s]  with a fucking coffee creamer and like those little wood sticks and shit with like mugs.
[2748.79s -> 2751.91s]  Everybody's, everyone would have like their own name on the mugs and shit. I'd be like,
[2751.91s -> 2759.16s]  you need a creamer in there? I'll just lean in. You tell me when. All right. There you go. All
[2759.16s -> 2767.05s]  right. You want more coffee? It's ready. All right. We have a show. We have a microwave
[2767.77s -> 2774.33s]  that I got from my grandmother's house after she died. And we've just plugged it in over here.
[2778.62s -> 2788.73s]  Why? Like what? Why? Doesn't that make people just fucking hate going to work?
[2788.73s -> 2796.60s]  If your break room is the equivalent of like an antique shop and half the stuff is just gross
[2796.60s -> 2806.89s]  and doesn't work, nobody wants to go in there. I even have my own fucking office. It's going to
[2806.89s -> 2812.41s]  be a goddamn, this is going to be the best coffee maker that I can get. It's going right there.
[2812.41s -> 2815.21s]  There's going to be a whole bar here. There's going to be like flavor pumps. There's going to
[2815.29s -> 2833.85s]  be like fucking stirring spoons. And then my company goes out of business in like 30 days.
[2833.85s -> 2841.80s]  But you don't want to go too far being like the cool boss. Cause then I would make like a,
[2841.80s -> 2846.44s]  I would bring like clowns to work and stuff. And that probably, I can't work Mr. Albertson. You
[2846.44s -> 2850.04s]  can't bring like clowns to work like once, like Friday. It's fucking annoying. It was funny on
[2850.04s -> 2856.74s]  Friday that one time. I'm like April fools and stuff. But like, no, I don't want to like ride
[2856.74s -> 2865.90s]  the slide before I start working. Like, can I just go to work? I don't want to like get on the ride
[2865.90s -> 2871.10s]  before work and like have like a big company, like let's all scream on the roller coaster you
[2871.10s -> 2878.17s]  built in the backyard. I have like a couple of reports I have to finish. What was I doing?
[2878.17s -> 2900.52s]  Where was I going with this? I can't, whatever. I got to move on. I'm thinking of, I'm thinking
[2900.52s -> 2905.02s]  of other things that I find funny that I have to like not think of funny. I have to like move on.
[2905.02s -> 2914.44s]  All right. Company pizza party. Let's go. What do we got? We need seats. Ooh. And no, no, no,
[2914.44s -> 2936.04s]  not yet. Counters. Look, you got to put your money where your mouth is. And like, I might,
[2936.04s -> 2967.90s]  what is this? Tea set? I need a toaster oven, right? Yeah. Oh, that's ugly. Ugly. Whoa. Oh,
[2967.90s -> 2982.25s]  oh, people still do this. Does people still do that? Can you imagine doing this? This would be
[2982.25s -> 2993.74s]  fucking horrifying. This would be terrifying. Why would you, why would you want that? I remember
[2993.74s -> 2999.02s]  when I was younger, this was always the, oh, like a big bear carpet. Wow. That's ridiculous.
[2999.02s -> 3003.02s]  Like, it was always like the meme for like a wealthy person's house. They had like the bear
[3003.02s -> 3009.32s]  carpet and I always thought it was really weird. And like thinking of this now, that's like, isn't
[3009.32s -> 3016.15s]  that really strange to have like the bear's like whole body flayed out, like dead with his head on?
[3016.15s -> 3024.68s]  What the fuck are people doing this for? I can't, I could not stand on that or lie down on that and
[3024.68s -> 3035.86s]  be comfortable. It would give me like anxiety. I'd be like, this is like fucked up. Vegan Andy.
[3035.86s -> 3045.56s]  Okay. There's a difference between not eating like meat and this, okay, this is like a flayed
[3045.56s -> 3051.77s]  out, like dead bear on the ground. You can't, this is different. This is like a different,
[3051.77s -> 3071.85s]  there's a huge spectrum here. It looks like it's horrible. That's horrible looking. What the fuck?
[3071.85s -> 3079.99s]  What is that? What do you think leather is? I don't, look, listen, I don't wait. I don't have like
[3079.99s -> 3086.76s]  leather clothes. And look, look, look, if you, if you have leather, like a leather wallet or something,
[3086.76s -> 3092.38s]  okay, there's leather, right? Leather is a thing. But like, if there was like a dead skinned cow
[3093.02s -> 3099.37s]  on the ground in your house, it would be a little weird, wouldn't it? It's like you stopped at like
[3099.37s -> 3106.39s]  the halfway point. No, no, no, no, no, no. Don't turn that. I want that, I want that skinned cow
[3106.39s -> 3110.71s]  with its head on lying on the ground and I want to, I want to step on it. I want to roll around in
[3110.71s -> 3116.63s]  it. I want to like get in there and roll around on him. That's different than having like a leather
[3116.63s -> 3132.33s]  wallet in your pocket. I'm sorry. I will die on that hill. That's why Jerma uses ridge wallets.
[3132.33s -> 3138.71s]  I can't say that because you all fucking, you all just like memed me to death.
[3145.13s -> 3151.21s]  All right, I keep getting distracted. Let's go. What do I need? I need chairs.
[3157.42s -> 3165.21s]  These are all right. How many people live here? Three. There'll be no more than two people sitting
[3165.21s -> 3170.01s]  at any given time. Rule of thumb, if you have a table and chairs in your house, this is very
[3170.01s -> 3175.91s]  important. The amount of chairs you have, half of them will always be used. So if you have like
[3175.91s -> 3181.11s]  six seats at a dining table, three to four will have people sitting at them at any given time.
[3181.11s -> 3187.00s]  So you go practical. Unless it's like seven people in your family or something.
[3187.00s -> 3200.18s]  No windows. I'm working on it. Ooh, I like that. 45. Oh, wait, wait, wait. I'm almost out of money.
[3200.18s -> 3215.56s]  All right. Beds. I need a, this is $3,000. What? That's too much. Are these the only
[3216.28s -> 3232.33s]  beds that two people can sleep in? Okay. I need a bed for the kid too. That's weird. Um,
[3232.33s -> 3242.18s]  I need another room. That would be so odd. No, that would be weird. Let me make another room.
[3242.18s -> 3248.81s]  Everybody relax. Would it be like an offshoot from this one? No, but then you'd have to go
[3248.81s -> 3286.71s]  into the, no. Okay. This is the, oh, this is a kid's room. It's gotta be fun. Don't worry. I'll
[3286.71s -> 3300.47s]  make it fun on the walls. See? Wait, no. This is fun. Well, that's actually, that kind of looks
[3300.47s -> 3329.54s]  dirty. See? This looks like skin. Whatever. Among us. I fucking, I, God, I'm not, whatever. Okay.
[3329.54s -> 3337.88s]  Now we can put the bed in here. Everybody needs to get a job too. What's the comfort on this thing?
[3337.96s -> 3349.19s]  Comfort seven, energy eight. Yeah, that's fine. Against the wall here. And then I need some other
[3349.19s -> 3354.97s]  stuff in the bedroom. Lighting. Well, we need lights. I need windows too. All right. Hanging lamps.

[3381.08s -> 3392.39s]  Yeah. You know what I'm saying? What do you mean? It's like a McDonald's warming lamp.
[3392.95s -> 3407.14s]  It's like a lizard lamp. Whatever. I'm going to put like a humidifier in here too. I need some,
[3407.14s -> 3420.89s]  uh, what do I need? Surfaces. I need some end tables. Hmm. I'm almost out of money. What are
[3420.89s -> 3432.23s]  these fucked up end tables? I just want a regular end table. Just a little end table. This stuff is
[3432.23s -> 3450.79s]  just so weird. Like I don't want like a big fucking wine jug in my house. Here we go. Wine jug.

[3498.55s -> 3510.74s]  Ladder eight. If you had this in your house, I would probably leave. I would leave. I would
[3510.74s -> 3518.71s]  find a way to stop talking to you over like a few months. Yeah. I wouldn't do it outright. I would,
[3518.71s -> 3524.07s]  we'd continue to hang out. We'd, but whatever. But like over like the next six months, I'm going
[3524.07s -> 3531.80s]  to make sure I find a way to stop talking to you. Cause like long-term, I'm not sure that
[3531.80s -> 3545.43s]  you and I are going to get along. What's this? Shootout? Why would you want this?
[3552.78s -> 3566.63s]  I really want it, but it's stupid. What's the bladder? Is this, why is this so weird?

[3613.34s -> 3618.12s]  no more money. People are going to have to wash their hands in the sink. I don't have a sink.

[3656.87s -> 3665.46s]  about it? Oh, well, uh, well, I'm reading the newspaper around here. I'm incredibly intelligent.

[4069.35s -> 4078.78s]  not that much time? 14 hour disappearance? Wouldn't that be like, that's not even a whole day.

[4112.54s -> 4121.88s]  think this is gonna end badly, right? This is gonna end so badly. All right, I'm gonna burn
[4121.88s -> 4133.38s]  this whole house down and I'm gonna jump in like the goofy hole. Why am I afraid of it? Hey,
[4133.38s -> 4148.15s]  hey Goth. Mortimer, you want to come give me a hand? You're gonna get CO2 poisoning
[4148.15s -> 4159.11s]  because there's no windows. Wait, what are you doing? What are you doing? She brought out milk
[4160.07s -> 4180.98s]  and what are you doing? What? Did somebody go in the hole? Oh, fresh burgers. Who wants

[4198.41s -> 4206.17s]  Jane doesn't like burgers. Take it out with your hand?
[4218.60s -> 4228.98s]  Well, oh, somebody knows what to do. You put the whole plate in? I don't have a roof. Oh,
[4228.98s -> 4237.08s]  well, I just need to go to work for one day. Are you hungry? Eat another burger then.

[4281.21s -> 4295.45s]  Jane, go to work. I don't have a roof. I don't? Yeah, I do. My god, this is an ugly house. I have
[4295.45s -> 4314.33s]  a roof. I'm going to the bathroom. What did you do in the bathroom? You took a shower?
[4319.54s -> 4323.99s]  Do I need more than one bathroom? Why are there so many people in here? This is a line to the toilet.
[4327.22s -> 4345.10s]  All right, get them to leave. All right, goodbye. Yeah, clean up. Clean up and you get a job too.
[4346.30s -> 4360.97s]  Oh, Tiffany, new resident here. Wait, come here. Are you going to my trash?
[4360.97s -> 4370.04s]  Here. So we, wait, are we both going to be psychics? That's stupid. We can't both be psychics.
[4370.60s -> 4375.85s]  No, wait for tomorrow. All right. Yeah, everybody get out. We have to clean up.
[4375.85s -> 4386.42s]  Nobody touch my weird whimsical devices out here, please.
[4386.42s -> 4388.58s]  And we need to be able to have like a party and stuff and greet people.
[4390.26s -> 4395.75s]  Oh, there needs to be food for her. Is there a hamburger on the ground?
[4395.75s -> 4403.77s]  Can you eat the hamburger that's on the ground? This is not even a house.
[4406.42s -> 4411.22s]  This is supposed to be like a log cabin. Like, there's nothing. There's like amenities in here.
[4412.02s -> 4417.66s]  What is this? Whose dog is this? Buzz.
[4424.54s -> 4432.60s]  Whose dog is Buzz? All right, what do you need? You need fun. All right, go play with the dog.
[4441.62s -> 4452.28s]  Where did he get that? Comfort, energy, fun. All right, they like hate everything.
[4454.74s -> 4457.70s]  All right, stop drinking coffee. Get away from the coffee machine.
[4462.01s -> 4463.93s]  Why do people keep getting stuck in here?
[4463.93s -> 4468.92s]  Why do people have to go to the bathroom so much?
[4473.02s -> 4480.33s]  Am I going crazy or is this bathroom just non-stop being used? Wait, the carpool?
[4482.81s -> 4487.88s]  It's nicely decorated. All right, Arthur. All right, you need to take a shower.
[4487.88s -> 4503.19s]  Everybody get out of here. Go in. Go in. Why wouldn't I go in the shower?
[4509.22s -> 4513.53s]  Why is the bathroom the coolest place in the whole house?
[4513.53s -> 4532.47s]  All of you leave. Get out. Quick shower. Hurry. All right, you schmooze it up with Tiffany. What?
[4532.47s -> 4550.49s]  Dog using the bathroom? Okay, comfort. What are you doing? Get out of here.

[4563.99s -> 4576.36s]  Kiss cheek. Just get out of the way. He's stuck. I'm gonna miss my ride. Why would I do this to this guy?
[4585.70s -> 4601.16s]  Go to work, man. Hurry up. I gotta chill out. Hurry up. Dog, get out of the way. Watch out.
[4605.72s -> 4610.20s]  What happened? Wait, what's going on?
[4616.04s -> 4618.04s]  The dog won't get out of the way.
[4623.11s -> 4625.19s]  The dog won't move. I can't go to work.
[4628.95s -> 4634.49s]  Somebody put it out. Somebody put it out quick.
[4635.37s -> 4642.97s]  The dog. Somebody do something. Put it out.
[4645.62s -> 4652.52s]  Come on, Jane. You can do it. We're fine. We're fine. We're fine. We're fine.
[4654.10s -> 4661.06s]  Jane's got it. She's doing fine. She's gonna put out the fire. Oh, no. Somebody else do it.
[4665.34s -> 4682.44s]  Put it out. The dog just pissed. Put it out. Hey, you don't have any frame to use the coffee maker.
[4686.09s -> 4690.26s]  He was supposed to make a coffee. He's just pissed that there's no furniture.
[4690.90s -> 4713.98s]  What did you put in here? Come on, Jane. You got it. Excellent work. The fire didn't continue to spread.
[4716.44s -> 4722.78s]  Let's celebrate with an espresso. Jane, you deserve it. That fucking dog being in the way.
[4723.58s -> 4731.99s]  That's the funniest shit. Somebody get this dog out of the road. What the fuck? I'm late to work.
[4731.99s -> 4739.83s]  All right. There's no damage. Everything's fine. Jane Sweets, let's give it up.
[4739.83s -> 4751.10s]  That was really, really good. We have to go to bed. This person's been here for like 13 hours.
[4753.24s -> 4759.83s]  We've just been draining espresso and not sleeping for like three days.
[4760.63s -> 4771.24s]  All right. Yeah, goodbye. It was very nice to see you. Goodbye. Goodbye. Have a great day.
[4773.16s -> 4787.86s]  It's time to go to bed. We need to clean up. Clean up. Clean up. Go to sleep. Say goodbye. Thanks
[4787.86s -> 4803.46s]  for coming. What time does she get back? 12? All right. Leave. I don't know why. I just thought
[4803.46s -> 4812.18s]  she got stuck in there. No, no. No more company. We don't have time for any more company. It was
[4812.18s -> 4826.26s]  a really fun party. Need a phone to call the police. I need more than $38. I can't call anybody
[4826.26s -> 4834.84s]  until I have enough money to buy the thing that calls people. Clean up. Pick all this up. Come on.
[4834.84s -> 4852.92s]  Ridiculous. All right. You're going to bed. That's good. Good. Energy. Sleep. All right.
[4852.92s -> 4868.41s]  Kids in bed. What is... I don't understand what keeps happening here. What is doing this? Why do
[4868.41s -> 4878.79s]  you have to go to the bathroom again? Again? This is weird, right? They keep going to the...
[4878.79s -> 4894.39s]  Is it because the toilet is from like the 15th century? All right. You're asleep. You'll be
[4894.63s -> 4904.02s]  good for school tomorrow. All right. Interest. Toys and pets. Ooh. She wants a dog or a cat or
[4904.02s -> 4920.55s]  something. Raids. B+. What do you call the dog? That's pretty good. That's B+. That's fine.
[4920.55s -> 4935.82s]  Don't need to be anyone in that. Why do I hear that noise? Why was... Why did they just play that
[4935.82s -> 4969.38s]  noise? Why did it do that? That's terrifying. I don't see anything. Was a burglar went by?
[4969.38s -> 4976.78s]  Is this the dog pee? Why is this on my screen? That's not my problem. Why do I have to clean up
[4976.78s -> 4985.53s]  the dog pee over here? What was that? All right. You need to go to bed. Bed. Bed. Bed. Bed. Time
[4985.53s -> 4998.52s]  for bed. Energy and comfort. When do I get home? 5? 12? 6 to 12 a.m. All right. I'll get back in
[4998.52s -> 5010.22s]  like five minutes. 100 bucks. Just save it. All right. Arthur, go. You take care of the stuff
[5010.22s -> 5029.61s]  outside. Clean this up. Plate and the sink. Prepare. Okay. How are you doing on personality?
[5029.61s -> 5048.97s]  You need to go to bed. He needs to be ready at 4 p.m. tomorrow. Fix the sink. All right.
[5048.97s -> 5066.33s]  Fresh burgers before bed. Come on. Fix it. Did you not fix it? Fix it. Oh, he got it. Okay.
[5071.62s -> 5075.46s]  All right. Time for bed. What do you need? You have hygiene's good. Energy. You need to eat.
[5075.46s -> 5088.23s]  No, he's actually good for food. But eat anyways. Okay. Then I'll be able... I only have $118.
[5091.62s -> 5099.50s]  Fuck. What can I even buy? All right. Cheeseburgers are too expensive.
[5099.50s -> 5116.65s]  No, no cheating. I'm not cheating. I'm not going to type in rosebud. No. All right. Now I need
[5116.65s -> 5128.02s]  comfort. Just head to bed. Then I'll be ready for work tomorrow. Then I'll get promoted. I need a
[5128.02s -> 5140.82s]  TV. Sell the coffee maker? All right. I have... Seriously, this is the hunger. She has eaten two
[5140.82s -> 5161.34s]  cheeseburgers at this point. She's still hungry. Why? Maybe that's why. Yuck. You made them. Just
[5161.34s -> 5180.36s]  eat them. Get a phone. Eat. Eating a hamburger with a fork and knife? She's not eating it. She's
[5180.36s -> 5194.17s]  cutting it up. She's pretending to eat it. Why did that not do anything? What do the burgers even do
[5194.17s -> 5203.32s]  for food? For hunger? It doesn't even... I didn't... My hunger went back down to where it was. Burgers
[5203.32s -> 5214.12s]  suck for food. Oh my god. All right. Go to bed. Everybody go to sleep now. What happened? Oh shit.
[5214.12s -> 5236.12s]  She can't get in bed. Another hamburger. Imagine eating... Imagine eating four hamburgers
[5236.92s -> 5259.40s]  and still being hungry at 4 a.m. All right. Just go to bed. Get in there now. Sleep. Oh. What?
[5262.66s -> 5269.90s]  Excuse me? Aren't we in the same... Aren't we married? Why won't they sleep together?
[5269.90s -> 5283.59s]  I mean not married. Not married. They have the same last name and they have a daughter. They don't
[5283.59s -> 5311.43s]  know each other. They're roommates. So who is... Who's kid is this? Is it our kid? We're just not
[5311.43s -> 5323.51s]  married. Another cheeseburger. This is the fifth cheeseburger. All right. Like shut the fuck up.
[5323.59s -> 5335.70s]  Like that would be so irritating. I wouldn't want to share a room with this person. This would suck.
[5335.70s -> 5339.90s]  It'd be horrible. Go sleep in a different room if you're going to be like this.
[5344.70s -> 5359.21s]  Like get out of here. Go sleep in another room. It just doesn't stop. I need more cooking skill.
[5359.21s -> 5364.15s]  I don't know why I thought she was about to eat... I thought she was going to eat the trash because
[5364.15s -> 5370.22s]  the food wasn't good from the hamburgers. All right. You need to go... All right. She got an open

[9684.98s -> 9691.18s]  uh all right let me i love it i kind of i want like a coffee i'll be right back i want to talk
[9691.18s -> 9699.02s]  about something really quick before i go brb so there used to be brb art when i would go brb uh
[9699.02s -> 9705.21s]  that is going to have to change because the amount of art because i'm only going to stream like once
[9705.21s -> 9712.12s]  or twice a week it's going to be impossible to keep up there is i believe a thousand pieces of
[9712.12s -> 9719.24s]  art that are just in the backlog which is just impossible i will never be able to keep up with
[9719.24s -> 9725.99s]  it so for the time being uh we're pausing submissions until i can figure out a solution
[9725.99s -> 9733.03s]  and there are a few solutions that i think i want to do yeah that is comic sans isn't it uh there
[9733.03s -> 9744.20s]  are a few different solutions it's it's going to become impossible because we did the math that i
[9744.20s -> 9750.33s]  will be like four and a half months six months behind always and it's going to get to a point
[9750.33s -> 9753.85s]  where there might be two three four thousand submissions that are in the backlog and they
[9753.85s -> 9761.50s]  will never be shown ever and remember i only stream once a week so showing artwork for like
[9761.50s -> 9771.30s]  a stream is impossible if i'm only going to stream once maybe twice a week i am coming up
[9771.30s -> 9777.42s]  with something to do and it might be really fun it might be really interesting i'll tell you when
[9777.42s -> 9789.61s]  i have that solution it's being worked on right now show them on multiple screens at once just
[9789.61s -> 9802.74s]  have two hour long vrbs one a second that would be so bad no but so brb art is on pause right now
[9802.74s -> 9807.30s]  until i can figure out what i'm gonna do and i do want to say this i do appreciate anybody that
[9807.30s -> 9814.02s]  sends any fan art to this channel um as you've known the channel has grown insanely over the
[9814.02s -> 9819.06s]  last year or two right i mean let's say i didn't even look there's 16 000 people here right now
[9819.06s -> 9824.68s]  that's fucking crazy i hope you're having fun but it is getting to a point where i'm reducing
[9824.68s -> 9831.10s]  the streams and i just can't keep up with it it's so much awesome stuff but it's just impossible
[9831.10s -> 9837.00s]  to keep up with i can't even like comprehend that this many people are here watching and on top of
[9837.00s -> 9842.58s]  that want to make pieces and artwork and videos and stuff it's it's a lot i can't even it's
[9842.58s -> 9849.22s]  incredible but no just know that i don't like it's not that i don't care about art and community
[9849.22s -> 9856.06s]  videos and community stuff it's just i've grown in size by like 150 percent and i've reduced the
[9856.06s -> 9866.15s]  streams by like 80 percent incredible well i said it wrong uh so yeah i'm gonna try to figure out
[9866.15s -> 9872.62s]  something to do it'll be fun it'll be interesting i hope so just know that that's why brb art is
[9872.62s -> 9879.29s]  currently like on pause we'll figure it out we always do right i'll be right back go get a snack
[9879.29s -> 10252.46s]  i'll get a coffee that's what i'm doing i'll be right back see you guys in a minute sorry i had

[22239.37s -> 22256.49s]  bot thing it killed a bunch of view bots um i don't know did i have how many followers do i
[22256.49s -> 22266.14s]  have right now i have 523 000 what did i have a week ago i don't think it looks like it affected
[22266.14s -> 22284.62s]  me that much 523 000 whatever i whatever was like two weeks ago i don't know they only removed bots
[22284.62s -> 22290.87s]  from 15 streamers really that's weird which basically dealt with a bunch of bot issues
[22290.87s -> 22294.39s]  and thus the bot problem so many channels might see a decrease in subs due to twitch removing a
[22294.39s -> 22306.78s]  bunch of bot accounts like like subbed bot sub bots i lost like 3000 oh well that doesn't seem
[22306.94s -> 22331.40s]  very much xqc lost a 1.5 million followers holy shit followers not subs yeah it's still a lot
