[1.27s -> 13.22s]  Oh, look who it is. It's Twitch chat. Hi guys. Uh, hold on. I gotta move my mic. Wait, wait, wait.
[29.51s -> 32.95s]  Hey, thank you for waiting. Your patience is unmatched, everybody.
[35.42s -> 41.10s]  Will I be watching green screen edits? No. I want to make sure I make this very clear, very,
[41.10s -> 51.02s]  very clear. Uh, green screen edits are going to be only designated for the green screen movie
[51.02s -> 55.58s]  night. They might be more than two. They might be even more than that. I might have to do more
[55.58s -> 60.76s]  than three, but, uh, we're not going to watch them on stream. We're not going to watch them
[60.76s -> 71.54s]  after the stream. It's, we're going to get a good, clean, dedicated movie night. Not even
[71.54s -> 77.91s]  one, not even one. Oh, we got it. We got to hold onto them. That's the specific reason
[78.47s -> 87.14s]  why we did it in the first place is to have like a big movie night. So this is a
[87.14s -> 97.35s]  little too loud, ain't it? Mr. Like Birdman is a little loud. Am I sick? I was a little stuffy
[97.35s -> 108.26s]  this morning, but I'm good. It should clear out here in a minute or so. What do I think of
[108.26s -> 121.38s]  Fallout 76? I haven't played Fallout 76. I heard it's not good though. I've heard it
[121.38s -> 127.08s]  is very, very, very much a broken video game. I don't really have any intention to play it.
[128.17s -> 136.26s]  Not really. That's an understatement. Yeah, I just don't, I didn't even attempt to play it.
[137.21s -> 142.81s]  But the thing that we're going to attempt to play tonight is something that we've been
[142.81s -> 146.25s]  talking about for a couple of weeks now. And I knew at some point I wanted to play it. So
[147.85s -> 151.88s]  we're going to do it tonight. And I know that this schedule has been so odd.
[153.32s -> 156.20s]  I've been streaming a lot more frequently, but it's probably going to stay like this.
[157.38s -> 162.90s]  I have not yet decided on how the hell I'm going to, what the new schedule will be.
[163.96s -> 179.03s]  I don't know. I mean, maybe we'll never stop streaming like Monday to Monday.
[188.02s -> 194.58s]  I'm kidding. That's not going to happen. Yeah. If you don't, if I played Undertale on stream
[195.78s -> 202.66s]  long time ago and I thought it was fun. I hope if you want to stick around and watch this,
[202.82s -> 208.55s]  this is just kind of an extra stream that I knew I wanted to do. So if you don't want to know,
[208.55s -> 214.39s]  if it's spoilers and all that shit and you don't care, then see you soon. Thanks for stopping by.
[216.01s -> 224.46s]  So let's get it on the screen. It's kind of odd to capture because it just like starts.
[226.20s -> 233.67s]  It's just, it just starts. So I got to turn this off and we're going to go.
[234.23s -> 245.16s]  It's a three hour game. Well, I don't even know. Is it? Here comes a three hour stream.
[245.16s -> 248.66s]  No, don't worry. I'm going to like really, I'm going to really drag this out.
[249.61s -> 254.57s]  Every opportunity that I can stop and make like a 30 minute conversation. I'm kidding.
[254.57s -> 264.71s]  Okay. It's got a weird name too. Like your computer thinks it's a virus, right? This is
[264.71s -> 268.07s]  not a virus, right? Is this, is this his way to make everybody, to make a big joke out of
[268.07s -> 276.33s]  this? All right, here it comes. It should, it should show up on the screen very shortly here.
[277.96s -> 280.84s]  Uh, any second now. There it is. Hey, are you there?
[282.36s -> 299.51s]  Welcome to Undertale 2. Are we connected? I remember that. That's the heart. Excellent.
[300.07s -> 306.74s]  Truly excellent. This is, this is 18 years in the making, by the way. He started this when
[306.74s -> 312.01s]  he was one. He started coding this when he was like, I think four and a half months old.
[312.65s -> 330.36s]  We may begin. First, you must create a vessel. Select the head that you prefer.
[340.41s -> 347.42s]  No, but this is more like me, right? Is that more like me? I've got like a long,
[347.42s -> 352.44s]  skinny chin and the hair that comes down. That's like hair going up, going down. That's
[352.44s -> 369.61s]  like a long chin. Select the torso that you prefer. Can you also, can you also customize kill
[369.61s -> 376.44s]  streaks? Well, I don't understand. All right. Well, I'm just making Charlie Brown.
[377.88s -> 389.94s]  Select the legs that you prefer. This is the same thing. What's the difference? A fat left
[389.94s -> 403.06s]  leg or a fat right leg? I'm just going to go with this one. This is your body. Do you
[403.06s -> 419.46s]  accept it? Sure. Excellent. You have created a wonderful form. Now let us shape its mind
[419.46s -> 426.34s]  as your own. Where the hell is Sans, man? I don't even like this. What is its favorite food?
[426.90s -> 438.22s]  Sweet, soft, sour, salty. Sans, where's Sans? Pain. Cold. No, my favorite food. I'm doing
[438.22s -> 443.83s]  this as if it's me. Okay. And whatever one is the closest to Sans is the one I'm going
[443.83s -> 450.38s]  to pick. I don't, I think I'm a salt kind of person. Salty. Sansy. You know, your favorite
[450.38s -> 462.28s]  blood type. Uh, D is not a blood type. That's like the funny answer. Or is that O? Is that
[462.28s -> 475.94s]  O? I don't even know what my blood type is. What is my blood type? There's no blood type
[475.94s -> 481.69s]  C. That's D, but that's not an O. Look at the O's up there. Look up under, see blood?
[482.33s -> 493.06s]  I think I'm a, I think I'm a, I think I'm a dual blood citizen. What color does it like most? Red,
[493.06s -> 504.12s]  blue, blue or green? Oh, right. Like that's a tough one. This is actually hard because these
[504.12s -> 516.52s]  are my two favorite colors. Am I determining how much HP I have by doing this and how many
[516.52s -> 521.16s]  intellect and like mystic points I get or something? It's going to be, it's going to
[521.16s -> 526.52s]  be, uh, I painted my office screen. It has to be green. It's going to, it's blue. I,
[526.52s -> 531.00s]  can I go back? Please give it a gift. Kindness, mind, ambition, bravery, voice.
[531.64s -> 536.47s]  Because you know, I got that one. How do you feel about your creation? It will not hear.
[537.43s -> 544.25s]  Well, I've got to tell you, I think it has a little bit of hope from that first game.
[544.81s -> 552.39s]  Remember that one? Determination. Where's that one? Where's Sans? Where's Sans? How do I feel
[552.39s -> 557.93s]  about your creation? I'm kind of afraid of it. I don't know if it could like much jump
[557.93s -> 568.63s]  at the screen. Have you answered honestly? Uh, yes. Yes, I have. Nice Peter Griffin voice.
[569.35s -> 575.43s]  Oh, Lois. Lois. You acknowledge the possibility of pain and seizure. What?
[578.58s -> 586.25s]  No, I have to acknowledge the fact that it's going to make it pain and seizure.
[586.81s -> 597.54s]  Is this, is this telling me that it's going to be flashy? No. Understood. Name your vessel.
[599.38s -> 657.27s]  Uh, me. Whoops. It's me. Who made it? No, no, no, no, no. I did. I made this. Excellent.
[657.83s -> 673.51s]  All right. Truly excellent. Thank you. I did this. Me. I. Your answers. Your wonderful
[674.47s -> 683.66s]  creation. Uh-oh. Will now be discarded. No one can choose who they are in this world.
[685.72s -> 701.58s]  Your name is Chris Sans. Uh, what's, how do I? Chris. Chris, if you do not wake up,
[701.58s -> 709.82s]  we'll be late for school, Chris. Oh, that's uh, that's Abigail. I will wait outside for
[709.82s -> 728.82s]  you. All right. Okay. I got my Legend of Zelda. The drawer is mostly empty except for a school
[728.82s -> 735.78s]  cross-country cert with a tear in it, a tear. Okay. So am I like in high school or something?
[735.78s -> 744.07s]  Closed draw. It's a beautiful day outside. There are CDs under the bed. Classical jazz,
[744.07s -> 749.35s]  religious scuff. There's also a game console. It is one normal controller and one knockoff
[749.35s -> 755.29s]  one. Stay, just stay. Definitely takes place in the nineties. It's a computer desk. There
[755.29s -> 765.88s]  are many boxes under it filled with old books. Okay. What about the bird? It's a red rag wagon
[765.88s -> 771.77s]  with a rusty bird cage in it. Looks like it's seen quite a few crashes. Why do you have a
[771.77s -> 781.45s]  bird cage? Ragged. There's a ragged in here. A cactus. There's not much to say about it.
[782.97s -> 786.97s]  There are crayons in the drawer. Their labels have long faded and there's no green.
[786.97s -> 789.29s]  Oh, just like the nineties. It's only you.
[791.80s -> 802.63s]  The door is locked. Okay. Bookshelf. There are many books. Tales of snails. A storybook.
[804.26s -> 810.26s]  Snails do not have tails. A scientific reputation. Can snails help your garden? Not
[810.26s -> 817.18s]  really. And a signed copy of the history of humans and monsters by Gerson Boom. That new
[817.18s -> 822.33s]  character that everyone's going to fall in love with. Wait, what about? That's it.
[828.71s -> 834.15s]  You looked inside the sink cupboard. There's a can of Icy's Cool Boys body spray. Spray
[834.15s -> 839.11s]  for the boys. Flamin' hot pizza flavor. It seems to be almost entirely full.
[842.63s -> 855.93s]  That's good. Yeah, Toby, you already got me. It's a toilet. Flush it. You flush the toilet.
[855.93s -> 886.81s]  Chris, is everything all right in there? Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to be the first person that finds
[886.81s -> 895.29s]  the secret with the toilet. Sans is going to come out of there. Chris, what are you doing
[895.29s -> 901.54s]  in there? You did not put a bath bomb in the toilet again, did you? I can't wait until Sans
[901.54s -> 915.02s]  comes out here and he goes. Can't wait until he does that. On the shower ledge, there's a
[915.02s -> 922.79s]  small container of apple scented shampoo and a gallon size container of pet shampoo.
[922.79s -> 936.10s]  All right, can I leave the bathroom? Wait, what if I say no? It's good to conserve water. Oh,
[936.74s -> 945.70s]  whoops. There's a photo on the fridge. It's of you, your mother, and your brother.
[946.26s -> 952.76s]  Okay, so I have brother. Is my brother going to be the guy from the first game?
[953.40s -> 958.84s]  Oh, by the way, I think this is a sequel to Undertale. I don't know. It might be.
[959.48s -> 967.24s]  It's emitting a pleasant floral scent. Cookie cutters for gingerbread monsters and gingerbread
[967.24s -> 974.60s]  humans. Cinnamony batter caked up. There's a cinnamony batter caked on the stove top.
[976.01s -> 979.37s]  There's some white fur stuck in the drain. You got to look at everything.
[981.02s -> 988.74s]  It's a landline phone, but you already have a cell phone. It's a chariol, the beloved living
[988.74s -> 997.11s]  room chair. All right, TV. All right, this hopefully this is like GTA. GTA. And there's
[997.11s -> 1000.39s]  like a shitload of TV channels. It's the TV doesn't seem to even be plugged in anymore.
[1008.70s -> 1014.06s]  Chris, there you are. We might still be able to make it. Here comes the first song. It's
[1014.06s -> 1021.46s]  a beautiful day today, is it not? I hope it stays this way when we when Asriel visits next
[1021.46s -> 1028.76s]  week. But I wonder after the excitement of university, will we still enjoy coming home to
[1028.76s -> 1038.22s]  this little town of Undertale? I remember those cats. I remember that girl from the Muppets
[1039.02s -> 1046.79s]  in the electric blue balloon band, whatever it's called. No, Dr. T in the electric mayhem.
[1046.79s -> 1075.32s]  We're going to school. I'm late. So does everyone have a...
[1077.80s -> 1081.96s]  Oh, Chris, we thought you weren't coming today. We're doing... No, this is... I know this
[1081.96s -> 1087.48s]  person. We're doing group projects this month. Oh, so walk around and find a partner. Okay.
[1088.60s -> 1115.62s]  The snake. Chris, you know, Jockington and Caddy are always partners. We're the ultimate
[1115.62s -> 1120.98s]  academic duo ever since our first gym class. It was hula hoop day and they ran in a hoops
[1120.98s -> 1129.88s]  for us. So she used me instead. That's our origin story. But I hardly know her.
[1130.68s -> 1137.08s]  Hahaha. What do you think of that one? Funny, right? No? Well, I got news for you, pal. I
[1137.08s -> 1173.05s]  already got a partner. Oh, I'm not doing this one. No, I'm not doing it. Black and white
[1173.05s -> 1180.97s]  hard-boiled egg. Sadly seems like it already has a partner. What about Falco? Chris lit again,
[1180.97s -> 1185.61s]  I see. Oh, you need a partner. Sorry, I'm already partners with the second smartest student.
[1186.57s -> 1190.97s]  Oh, wait. Chris, now that I think about it, your unique skill set might help a lot on this
[1190.97s -> 1198.39s]  assignment. What? I actually wanted to get an A. All right, easy. Settle down here, daffy duck.
[1199.19s -> 1204.18s]  Hey, Chris, what's up? Did you lose your pencil again? Here, you want the candy cane
[1204.18s -> 1210.63s]  one or the one with the lights on it? Huh? You want to be partners? Birdly already asked me,
[1210.63s -> 1216.55s]  but I could ask his Alphys if we could make a group of three. I'll ask if you're sure. Not
[1216.55s -> 1223.67s]  yet. I'm going to be the third partner here. What about cat sip from final fantasy seven?
[1224.39s -> 1234.23s]  I'll click, click, tap, tap, take. I can't. I have to. Okay, I have to let go. Ask her
[1234.23s -> 1240.52s]  for this. What? Whoa, whoa, whoa. What am I watching on my phone? It's schoolwork, of
[1240.52s -> 1247.00s]  course. Animated schoolwork. And hey, Chris, have you chosen a partner yet? I want to be partners
[1247.00s -> 1255.74s]  with the snake. This is kind of not fair. If you can't get anyone, maybe your mom will be your
[1255.74s -> 1269.51s]  partner again. Okay, where is haymaker? No, no, let's be partners. Okay, I'll ask. Miss Alphys,
[1269.51s -> 1274.28s]  is it okay if we have a group of three? No, I don't want to approve of this. Abort.
[1275.42s -> 1281.42s]  Well, but Chris doesn't have a... Noelle, what were you saying? She was saying we're five-y alone.
[1282.30s -> 1291.14s]  I just wanted to know if... Noelle, can you please speak up? Uh-oh. Hi, five-five-y.
[1291.94s -> 1304.31s]  Five-oo-five-y. Am I late? Oh, no, no, you're fine. We were just choosing partners for the
[1304.31s -> 1317.98s]  next group project. And five-ee-five-y, you're with Chris. Great. Now that everyone's here,
[1317.98s -> 1331.42s]  I'll write the assignment down. Has anyone seen the chalk? This is the third time it's gone missing,
[1331.42s -> 1339.13s]  and you all know I can't start class without some chalk. How about this? If no one speaks up,
[1339.13s -> 1348.78s]  everyone gets in trouble. Anyone, please? This teacher sucks. Hey, there might be a box in
[1348.78s -> 1355.26s]  the supply closet. Miss Alphys, why don't you just, uh, sell... Oh, five-oo-five-y and I.
[1355.98s -> 1362.18s]  Good idea, Noelle. Since you came in last, five-oo-five-y, why don't you go and get it
[1362.18s -> 1379.50s]  for me? You can't keep this up, I know. And Chris, can you go with her and make sure she
[1379.50s -> 1395.86s]  actually gets it and stays out of trouble? Thanks, Chris. See you later. Eating the chalk?
[1395.86s -> 1408.89s]  What are you doing? Whose footprints are these? Chris. Didn't see you there. Hey.
[1410.01s -> 1427.90s]  You didn't see anything just now, did you? Huh. You can't even say. Chris.
[1427.90s -> 1443.08s]  I can't get in there. I have to go around my pop filter. Let me tell you a secret. Oh!
[1447.19s -> 1453.19s]  Quiet people piss me off. Just because you don't say anything,
[1453.19s -> 1459.03s]  I can't tell exactly what you're thinking. It's over! I caught five-ee-five-ee eating all the
[1459.03s -> 1464.65s]  chalk. This was her last chance. Now she'll finally be expelled.
[1465.61s -> 1473.56s]  Come on, Chris. Don't act shocked. You know it's true. Everyone's waiting for it. Everyone wants
[1473.56s -> 1478.68s]  to see this happen. Why am I pulling these back? Why? So, congrats, Chris. You got me.
[1478.68s -> 1487.18s]  I'm done for. Let me say, one little thing seems like a waste to get expelled just for having
[1487.18s -> 1494.52s]  a snack. So, Chris, if I know you're going to pull the trigger, I'm going to just get
[1494.52s -> 1512.50s]  expelled with some real carnage. Chris, how do you feel about losing your face? Chris,
[1512.50s -> 1516.60s]  you got a good mother. It would be a shame to make her bury her child. What the
[1516.60s -> 1521.30s]  fuck is happening? All right, let's get this over with. We'll get more chalk,
[1521.30s -> 1525.86s]  mosey back to class, and then, Chris, you'll do our project. How's that sound?
[1527.62s -> 1531.70s]  What happened? What? Don't bother answering. If you haven't gotten it by now,
[1532.26s -> 1544.10s]  your choices don't matter. Let's go, freak. At least you're honest. The locker is covered in
[1544.10s -> 1552.82s]  Jockington Memorabilia. Locked. Locked. Locker's lock is locked. The lock's locker is
[1552.82s -> 1564.66s]  locked. The lockers lock's locker is locked. All right, are you ready for the Sadie Hawkins
[1565.46s -> 1573.46s]  Hawkman's Sadie Hawkman's dance? At this dance, all chaperones will wear giant hawkheads
[1573.46s -> 1583.58s]  and screech at any students that make contact. God, can you walk any slower or what?
[1584.46s -> 1588.25s]  Nah, I get it. Not used to walking around without someone holding your hand.
[1589.53s -> 1600.41s]  Come on, freak. This is like bad. Well, here's the closet. Too bad. We were just
[1600.49s -> 1610.95s]  starting to have fun. What the hell is happening? Hey, Chris, is it me or
[1612.07s -> 1618.84s]  is it really dark in there? Hold up, Chris. Are you going to go in or what?
[1619.40s -> 1631.75s]  Come on, if you're going to be a wimp, then I'll. We'll both go in at the same time.
[1636.41s -> 1639.93s]  See, why are you so scared? There's nothing in here but old papers.
[1640.57s -> 1644.09s]  Let's try to find a light switch. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[1646.28s -> 1649.72s]  That's weird. I can't find a switch. This is further in.
[1653.35s -> 1657.43s]  Uh, kind of big for a closet, huh? You think we'd have reached the end by now?
[1657.43s -> 1665.10s]  Is this a surprise birthday party? Hey, Chris, I think this closet's broken.
[1665.90s -> 1669.56s]  There aren't any walls. Well, we've worked hard enough.
[1670.20s -> 1673.88s]  If Alfie wants chalk so bad, she can get it herself. Let's split.
[1681.22s -> 1693.78s]  What the? Hey, this isn't funny. Let us out. Let us. Here he comes.
[1694.76s -> 1712.04s]  The floor, it's. Did I not play Undertale? I play. Yeah, I played through Undertale like
[1713.10s -> 1731.80s]  fucking five times. Wait, what happened? Am I a different, am I the same character?
[1735.53s -> 1738.73s]  At times you see it flickering, the light only you can see.
[1738.73s -> 1744.14s]  By second nature, you reach out and save the game. I made this.
[1744.78s -> 1760.23s]  I found the run button. Yeah, I did. Cool. You're not going to move? Yes, you are.
[1760.87s -> 1771.16s]  It's really interesting tidbit about this game. Toby made the whole thing in Game Boy camera,
[1771.16s -> 1783.98s]  which is like just, I don't even know how you did that. It's too dark to see anything.
[1786.89s -> 1790.89s]  I thought you, I mean, I, I, I mean, I did. You thought I made, yeah, well, I mean,
[1793.29s -> 1803.99s]  I saw a figure. A blob that seems to be able to move. It's too dark to see anything.
[1803.99s -> 1807.19s]  One of these is going to have some kind of item in it, right? Has to. It's too
[1807.19s -> 1818.79s]  dark to see anything. All right, that's creepy. Right? Like, come on. This is weird.
[1818.79s -> 1829.82s]  It's too dark to see anything. Let's go down. Uh, item. There's something glowing inside.
[1829.82s -> 1839.06s]  Take it. Yes. You got the glow shard. Can I see what it is? No, don't toss it.
[1840.62s -> 1845.98s]  I have a cell phone. Glow shard. A shimmering shard. Its use is unknown.
[1846.62s -> 1859.14s]  Equip wood blade. Nothing, nothing. No weapons. Power. Level one human.
[1860.02s -> 1874.12s]  Body contains a human soul. Spells. Guts. Magic defense. Config file. I think this is
[1874.12s -> 1882.06s]  full on full screen. Hold on a second here. All right. That's pretty good, actually,
[1882.06s -> 1888.15s]  because now I can do this. I was running into a window this whole time because there's no way
[1888.15s -> 1901.53s]  to. Oh, is this going to work? There we go. That looks so much better. Cool. Nice. All
[1901.53s -> 1906.65s]  right. So now we are actually in full screen. You press alt enter. I didn't really think about
[1906.65s -> 1913.10s]  it. All right, let's go. That's, that's a lot better. Now I can actually see everything.
[1913.98s -> 1918.62s]  All right, so there's a figure going this way. We're going to go this way.
[1919.42s -> 1931.14s]  That one's red. It's going to shoot a laser beam. Yep. Come on. I've got Platinum
[1931.14s -> 1933.78s]  God and Binding of Isaac. You really think I'm going to get hit by that?
[1934.97s -> 1939.27s]  What are you talking about? You bathe your body in the light. Power shines within you,
[1939.27s -> 1944.86s]  breaking through the darkness. Any pain you may have had melted away. HP fully restored.
[1944.86s -> 1952.81s]  And a safe one. In this land, only eyes blinded by darkness can see the way.
[1953.53s -> 1964.39s]  Okay. So we've got, uh, that's the two. And hold on. We got to, they all have to be dark.
[1965.19s -> 1972.04s]  So that's it. Eyes blind. Darkness is the way, right?
[1978.34s -> 1983.59s]  2000 hours in Binding of Isaac. I've stepped on the cubes that you need to step on to open the
[1983.59s -> 1999.67s]  door in a certain order. Come here. Come on, man. Should I talk to these guys? Oh, they just
[1999.67s -> 2006.94s]  explode. I'm really, I'm actually pretty good at this because I mean, I like, I have about
[2006.94s -> 2010.30s]  two, 3000 hours in Binding of Isaac. And when you, I always check all the poops for coins
[2010.30s -> 2020.25s]  and everything. You know what I mean? So, Hey, back off. Come any closer and I'll Chris.
[2020.33s -> 2025.85s]  Phew. Hey, don't scare me like that. Dumb ass. Unless you want to get clocked in the face.
[2027.77s -> 2030.49s]  Anyway, enough screwing around. We got to find a way out of here.
[2033.62s -> 2038.98s]  Uh, where is here? Anyway, it doesn't matter. You got us into this mess. You get us out of
[2038.98s -> 2046.86s]  here. Lead the way, Chris. Are there party members? This is fairly new and that fairly,
[2046.86s -> 2051.34s]  I mean, it is new because I'm like, God, nevermind. You walk way too slow. I was just
[2051.34s -> 2061.42s]  sprinting. What? I was just going as fast as I could warm up. Okay.
[2065.77s -> 2069.53s]  Hey Chris, there's someone up there waving at us. Any idea what they want?
[2071.05s -> 2083.56s]  Here he is. He's going to be here. I can't believe it. Run. Talking about a guy. Oh,
[2083.56s -> 2090.66s]  wow. Like mega Satan, huh? I have plenty of training. I beat mega Satan with fucking
[2090.74s -> 2116.50s]  lost. I didn't get hit one time. Down here quick. I didn't even know what it wanted me to do.
[2122.46s -> 2141.03s]  I didn't even get to see the tutorial. All right. If I can hit one fucking time,
[2141.03s -> 2151.54s]  I'm going to go in the dryer and have somebody turn it on. Oh my God. He's so weird.
[2152.18s -> 2160.86s]  I wonder if there's any in that building up there. Weird flex. What?
[2166.38s -> 2169.82s]  Let me check and open these doors. It looks like a shop, but the door's locked
[2169.82s -> 2184.74s]  and no one's inside. I'm so weird and quirky. It's locked. I hate that word. That word is
[2184.74s -> 2197.96s]  worse than mayonnaise. In front of you. Yeah. Castle looms beneath the empty town. A black
[2197.96s -> 2204.52s]  geyser emerges from it, piercing endlessly into the sky. Power of this place shines within you.
[2205.32s -> 2220.89s]  Yeah, I'll say, but I guess we're going straight in a castle. Why the hell is there
[2220.89s -> 2229.82s]  a castle inside a supply closet? Welcome. Do not be alarmed. I am not your enemy.
[2230.54s -> 2241.64s]  Please come forward. Both of you at the same time. Welcome. I am the Prince of this kingdom,
[2241.64s -> 2248.94s]  the kingdom of darkness. Chris Susie. Oh, sorry. Five oh five. There's a legend in this land,
[2248.94s -> 2254.70s]  a legend that Monday two heroes of light will arrive and fulfill the ancient prophecy foretold
[2254.70s -> 2267.86s]  by time and space. Please hear us. Listen to my tale. Very well. Once upon a time,
[2267.86s -> 2276.58s]  a legend was whispered among shadows. It was a legend of hope. It was a legend of dreams.
[2277.30s -> 2290.62s]  It was a legend of light and darkness. This is the legend of Delta Rune. For millennia,
[2290.62s -> 2299.29s]  light and dark have lived in balance, bringing peace to the world. But if this
[2299.29s -> 2305.83s]  harmony were to shatter, a terrible calamity would occur on this world.
[2307.27s -> 2314.22s]  The sky will run black with the terror and the land will crack with fear.
[2316.78s -> 2327.99s]  Then, a heart pounding, the earth will draw her final breath. Only then shining with hope,
[2330.57s -> 2338.01s]  three heroes appear at world's edge. Sans, Papyrus, and you, a human, a monster,
[2340.15s -> 2349.08s]  and a prince from the dark, me, Sans. Only they can see of the fountains. Thank you for
[2349.08s -> 2355.24s]  playing the Delta Rune demo and banish the angels' heaven. Only then will balance be
[2355.24s -> 2368.30s]  restored and the world saved from destruction. Today, the fountain of darkness, the geyser that
[2368.30s -> 2379.45s]  gives this land form, stands tall at the center of the kingdom. But recently, another
[2379.45s -> 2386.41s]  fountain has appeared on the horizon. It's over there. And with it, the balance of light and
[2386.41s -> 2402.04s]  dark begins to shift. So, Chris, five of us, thank you for listening to my long tale.
[2402.04s -> 2406.34s]  I deeply believe you two are the heroes of the legend. That despite whatever
[2406.34s -> 2412.73s]  enemies you may face, you two have the courage to save the world. Delta warriors,
[2412.73s -> 2422.73s]  please, won't you accept your destiny? Uh, no. Wait, what? Me, some kind of hero or something?
[2422.73s -> 2429.93s]  No way, not me. You've got the wrong person. But, but, but, without you, the world is...
[2430.81s -> 2433.85s]  So what, if the world is destroyed, I don't care. It's none of my damn business.
[2434.57s -> 2441.94s]  Might even be kind of fun. Anyway, Chris, if you want to play pretend with this weirdo,
[2442.02s -> 2447.10s]  stick around. I'm going to find a way out of here. Oh, no, five will find me, wait.
[2455.91s -> 2462.68s]  Oh, wait. The heroes are already running away. And they didn't even know I was here. My dad's
[2462.68s -> 2472.86s]  gonna make me son of the month. Who the hell are you? I'm the bad guy. You clowns want
[2472.86s -> 2478.06s]  to seal our dark fountain, huh? I'm still picturing you guys as clowns. Save the world
[2478.06s -> 2485.03s]  from eternal darkness, huh? Hey, don't try and deny it. We both know you'll go east.
[2485.67s -> 2492.87s]  It's your only way home. But I, Lancer, won't let you go there. And I've got a flawless two-step
[2492.87s -> 2502.30s]  plan to ensure it. Step one, I thrash you. Step two, you lose. Nice playing, kid. Really?
[2503.48s -> 2514.12s]  Actually, it's a pretty good plan. Mind if we use it on you instead? Actual full-on RPG.
[2515.24s -> 2533.62s]  Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, whoa, whoa. What was that? Interesting. Okay. So you
[2533.62s -> 2543.69s]  have to time, it's time hits. Okay, cool. And then when you, all right, this is cool.
[2543.69s -> 2553.80s]  This is like just, that's really, that's actually pretty cool. I'm gonna do it. Check.
[2553.80s -> 2557.88s]  Warning. You tell Lancer to watch out for Suzy's attack. He readies himself.
[2558.60s -> 2569.29s]  So what are you guys gonna do? What are you guys doing after this? Lancer's motorcycle is
[2569.29s -> 2578.09s]  actually just a bike that's on fire. That was a compliment. You tell Lancer you can't
[2578.09s -> 2582.25s]  tell the difference between his clothes and his body. He seems flattered. His attack power
[2582.25s -> 2592.57s]  went down. Oh, you make my feelings do wheelies. Sweet wheelies. Oh, I'm getting hit.
[2593.21s -> 2597.53s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait a second. My bike's running out of fuel. All right, you
[2597.61s -> 2601.69s]  punkaroos. You had the luck of the draw this time. Next time the losers will be you.
[2602.65s -> 2608.41s]  What does that say? I don't know what that means. Bye losers. I gotta get home before dinner.
[2609.21s -> 2622.79s]  39 D money. Oh, it's a dryer run. Oh shit. I gotta go in there. Are you two okay?
[2623.90s -> 2633.06s]  Um, allow me to introduce myself more properly. I am. Take off the hood.
[2634.31s -> 2638.04s]  I can barely hear you. Oh, all right.
[2648.34s -> 2653.08s]  Well, I don't even like, I didn't even, I don't care if Sans is in the game.
[2653.08s -> 2661.27s]  I don't give a shit. Why am I pretending to care about that? I got like, I pretended to care
[2661.27s -> 2666.87s]  about it like an hour ago. And me, I like believed my own pretending. I was actually
[2666.87s -> 2673.13s]  waiting for it. Hello everyone. I'm Rousey. Chris, Susie, it's ever so wonderful to meet
[2673.13s -> 2678.09s]  you. I'm certain we're going to become great friends and this way to leave is east, right?
[2679.22s -> 2691.05s]  Yes, that's where I wheel. Got it. See you at school, Chris. Um, I suppose it's just the two of
[2691.05s -> 2701.24s]  us then. Chris, I'm a prince, but I currently don't have any subjects. I've been waiting
[2701.24s -> 2706.44s]  alone here my whole life for you two to arrive. So I'm really happy to meet you.
[2707.32s -> 2713.94s]  Hope we can be good friends, Chris. Let's try to find Susie. She must be to the southeast.
[2713.94s -> 2725.82s]  You can lead the way, Chris. Hey Chris, I really think we should go catch up with Susie. We can
[2725.82s -> 2731.16s]  come back here after our adventure is over and then I can bake you a yummy cake. Hey, thanks.
[2731.88s -> 2743.14s]  Rousey the lonely prince is now your ally. Our fluffy boys shines within you.
[2756.12s -> 2760.68s]  Oh, Chris, it's the training dummy I made. Now seems like a great chance to prepare for
[2760.68s -> 2765.80s]  the enemy. Would you like me to teach you how to fight? Yeah, I just, I want to know. I know
[2765.80s -> 2769.96s]  how to do it, but I just want to be told because I want to know what the deal is. See that heart
[2769.96s -> 2775.24s]  there, Chris? Yep. That's your soul, the combination of your being within it holds your
[2775.24s -> 2779.88s]  well, your compassion and the fate of the world. If it gets hit, you and your friends
[2779.88s -> 2786.60s]  will die. If everyone's HP reaches zero, then Jerma has to get into a dryer and we'll lose.
[2786.60s -> 2790.20s]  So please take care not to get hit. Don't get hit by the enemy stacks. Ready? Let's try
[2790.20s -> 2801.98s]  dodging. What? Natural. Anyhow, after the enemy attacks, it's our turn, Chris. First,
[2801.98s -> 2807.10s]  I'll teach you how to fight. The fighting is unnecessary in this world. There's no harm in a
[2807.10s -> 2813.03s]  thorough lesson. Is there anything I can do besides this? Right, that's it, right?
[2814.07s -> 2817.67s]  Wow, Chris, that was an amazing attack. Have you done this before or something?
[2818.71s -> 2823.06s]  Okay, now let's try defending. Simply defend and the enemy's attack will hurt you less.
[2823.14s -> 2828.82s]  Not only that, but you'll also gather TP. Watch the orange big bar on the left and we'll explain
[2828.82s -> 2837.99s]  it next. Great, now that we've gathered TP, how about spending that TP on one of my spells?
[2838.95s -> 2845.69s]  Because you hit the enemy enough, it got tired. Stop, I used my pacify spell on it.
[2845.69s -> 2856.98s]  It'll fall asleep and we'll win peacefully. Magic pacify on the tired dummy. Great,
[2857.06s -> 2860.26s]  you could have won the battle by now. Now I have just a little more to teach you.
[2861.30s -> 2865.22s]  Acting through this, even though the even the most violent enemies can be defeated through
[2865.22s -> 2871.80s]  various acts of kindness. Chris, though, is just a dummy. Why not give it a hug?
[2872.60s -> 2882.02s]  You know, I can hug the prince. Oh, that's great, Chris. Each enemy has different acts
[2882.02s -> 2887.14s]  that satisfy them. When an enemy is satisfied, its name turns yellow. When that happens, you
[2887.14s -> 2891.93s]  can defeat it by sparing it. If we spare all the enemies we meet, we'll never have to fight.
[2892.81s -> 2909.66s]  So is it yellow? Not quite. You can hug Rousey. Chris, I don't think this is what you're supposed
[2909.66s -> 2920.94s]  to be doing. Hug. Hug the dummy. That's great, Chris. Just one hug is enough, though.
[2921.66s -> 2931.05s]  Oh, I don't know how to do anything else. So that is yellow. Great job. That'd be the end
[2931.05s -> 2935.83s]  of the real battle. I'm really happy I had the chance to teach you, Chris. That's zero
[2935.83s -> 2944.55s]  xp in two delays. That was fun. You're a wonderful student, Chris. And in case you ever need a
[2944.55s -> 2949.83s]  refresher eye, here I wrote a manual for you. You see, open the menu, use it on your items.
[2950.71s -> 2967.13s]  It's just a dummy. What a JoJo reference? What does that mean? Oh my, the great door is open!
[2967.13s -> 2972.90s]  No wonder Lancer was able to come through. Chris, once we pass through this door, our
[2972.90s -> 2977.78s]  adventure will really begin. A journey foretold exactly by the prophecy, but Chris, I believe
[2977.78s -> 2983.06s]  your choices are important, too. This world is full of all kinds of people, Chris. In the end,
[2983.06s -> 2989.06s]  how we treat them makes all the difference. So let's try our best to kill everyone, every
[2989.06s -> 2994.42s]  person you come across, and get the bad ending. If we can manage to do that, then chat will
[2994.42s -> 2999.38s]  be very upset, and I believe this tale may have a very bad ending and a lot of unsubscriptions
[2999.38s -> 3006.66s]  to your channel. Otherwise, I fear that you may get the good ending and people will be happy.
[3007.38s -> 3017.74s]  Oh, I'm sorry. Is that too much? I knew you were here the moment I saw it. Let's try our best.
[3018.54s -> 3030.70s]  Thank you for playing! The Mario demo screen is going to turn off, the thing that used to be
[3030.70s -> 3040.66s]  in GameStop. Now I gotta let the person behind me play. Reset the Super Nintendo on me.
[3041.30s -> 3050.09s]  With the door closed behind you, your adventure will truly begin. Our adventure
[3050.09s -> 3061.42s]  shines within you. 46 minutes. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Let's take the scenery in first. I mean,
[3061.42s -> 3067.69s]  why am I rushing through this? This demo is only like three hours long. I might as well
[3067.69s -> 3082.41s]  just look at everything. The field of hopes and dreams. Enemies ahead, you're gonna die.
[3082.49s -> 3083.45s]  Signed Lancer.
[3097.02s -> 3111.06s]  Okay, Rudin Drewneer. He won. I didn't have an option. Did I just kill him?
[3111.06s -> 3115.34s]  I didn't have an option. I didn't kill him. I scared him.
[3121.40s -> 3125.16s]  Bad ending. If you're reading this, I guess you're dead. Signed Lancer.
[3126.66s -> 3132.50s]  I didn't act. I will... I... Get away from me with the sword! Don't come up to me with the sword.
[3133.22s -> 3145.56s]  Idiot. Hey, don't read the sign. It's a work in progress. Signed Lancer.
[3152.34s -> 3156.90s]  Ho ho ho, but isn't my two favorite people. Sike, you guys aren't even in my top five.
[3158.26s -> 3163.70s]  Lancer, where's Susie? You mean that purple girl? Ho ho ho, you fools! You're too late to
[3163.70s -> 3169.86s]  stop me. What did you do? It was so simple. She beat me up, so I ran away.
[3171.05s -> 3177.93s]  Hence a bit anti-climactic. Am I dead? Sorry, you're just going to stand there.
[3178.49s -> 3192.68s]  Thought you would at least run to the right. Why? The purple girl's over there. Well,
[3192.68s -> 3200.10s]  all right. Put him up down. These types of trees don't contain an item that can heal you.
[3200.74s -> 3205.22s]  Whatever you do, don't check the tree and use C to open your menu. Got it? Signed Lancer.
[3206.10s -> 3215.88s]  There are two objects hanging from the tree. Take one. You got the dark candy. What about
[3215.88s -> 3223.08s]  the other one? Take, yeah. You got the, this, okay, this is two. There's nothing hanging low
[3223.08s -> 3233.70s]  enough to take. All right, see you later, weirdo. Hey, if you head that way, my troops will
[3233.70s -> 3244.44s]  trash you. Is that a threat? I prefer to think of it as an invitation. All right, I'm gonna
[3244.44s -> 3252.04s]  be, I'm gonna be nice. A necklace of Rudens blocks your path. All right, Ruden up top. Let's see,
[3252.04s -> 3262.36s]  check. Let's, let's lecture. A necklace of Rudens blocks your path. I can only act with, um,
[3263.16s -> 3269.27s]  Chris. You lecture the enemies on the importance of kindness. The enemies became tired.
[3270.63s -> 3272.79s]  What? Okay, long live the guy who pays us.
[3272.87s -> 3287.67s]  Yes, long live the guy who pays us. Ruden is starting to fall asleep. Can I, they're not yellow yet.
[3288.47s -> 3297.43s]  Convince. You told Ruden to quit fighting. It was utterly swayed. Yeah, I guess it makes sense.
[3297.43s -> 3305.82s]  Face my diamond cutter. Hitbox is fairly large, but I guess that's the, all right, spare.
[3308.36s -> 3312.92s]  Ruden is starting to fall asleep. Let's, uh, spare. I can only spare the top one. Chris,
[3312.92s -> 3321.02s]  spared Ruden. Name wasn't yellow. Face my diamond cutter so you can pacify.
[3321.82s -> 3332.81s]  Does pacify just make them more susceptible to, ow. Not yet. All right, let's convince.
[3333.61s -> 3355.03s]  Pacify just ends the fight. Wait, did I just hit him? I think I hit him. Good. He missed.
[3355.03s -> 3363.02s]  All right, starting to fall asleep. There you go. I get, the only thing that's confusing me
[3363.02s -> 3367.10s]  is from the first game just having the one menu and having more than one party member is
[3367.66s -> 3381.26s]  trying to get used to that. See, I spared them. They're fine. I thought that was him.
[3385.37s -> 3391.77s]  Damn. But thank you, uh, thank you Alpine's B for the hundred dollars.
[3393.02s -> 3398.54s]  A hundred bucks from Alpine. Thank you. Hi, Jeremy. I'm donating on behalf of my friend
[3398.54s -> 3405.34s]  Michael who passed away recently. We've been following since the TF2 days and you've given
[3405.34s -> 3410.82s]  us so much joy. Thank you for everything. Alpine, I'm very sorry to hear about that.
[3414.17s -> 3421.77s]  Thank you so much for the hundred bucks. You too have been apparently following since, well,
[3421.77s -> 3433.02s]  all the way back then. I'm really sorry to hear about that. Hopefully you give yourself
[3433.02s -> 3442.47s]  the time necessary to grieve and and much love and much respect to obviously Michael's
[3442.47s -> 3451.82s]  family as well. So take care of yourself and thanks for, uh, thanks for being around.
[3466.04s -> 3468.44s]  Nothing can take away the memories that you two have. That's true.
[3469.40s -> 3488.87s]  That is very true. Why is everyone's messages getting deleted? They shouldn't be.
[3490.31s -> 3502.66s]  Let's go here. Uh, I'm Top Chef. My latest cake worked me to exhaustion. Top Chef.
[3504.42s -> 3509.62s]  Message deleted. What's going on? Oh, now you guys are just joking with me here.
[3514.62s -> 3518.06s]  Mama Miba, I'm Top Chef. My latest cake worked me to exhaustion.
[3518.86s -> 3526.14s]  So I took a little nap, but Mama Miba, a scary noise woke me up. The beast was
[3526.14s -> 3530.94s]  hunched on the table, eating the cake like an animal. I spritzed it with water and
[3530.94s -> 3536.62s]  hissed and ran off. But my wonderful cake is... Oh Chris, that sounds like Susie. We must be
[3536.62s -> 3548.92s]  going the right way. Let's try to keep her out of any more trouble. I got, hold on,
[3548.92s -> 3558.25s]  this is important. I got something else to say. Um, I just want to make this, uh, very
[3558.25s -> 3567.66s]  clear that anytime I hear about something like this, right? Uh, I'm, I'm so just,
[3569.48s -> 3574.76s]  if you have this channel and you and your friends and or you and your family members or
[3574.76s -> 3578.36s]  whatever and you guys hang out here and you like this shit and you hang and it's like,
[3578.36s -> 3593.22s]  it means a lot to you. It means a lot to me. So just knowing that people have fun here
[3593.22s -> 3599.77s]  and we're, I think about it a lot. So just want to make sure you guys are very clear on
[3599.77s -> 3619.56s]  that. Thanks a lot. All right, let's go back into it. Uh, here's the cake. Why is the cake
[3620.52s -> 3630.54s]  like a flying saucer? Take a piece of cake. Yeah, sure. The broken cake was added to your
[3630.54s -> 3647.27s]  key items. Is that bad? Should I not be doing that? What if I talk to him again with the,
[3647.27s -> 3653.80s]  can I give him the piece of cake? Mama meba mama mama sheba. You know that beast,
[3653.88s -> 3666.78s]  please don't come back. All right. No, no, no. No Hathi blocked the way.
[3671.05s -> 3679.21s]  All right. Rudin needs to be lectured and how much magic I don't have any magic. So
[3680.09s -> 3691.37s]  defend first. The enemies became tired. What? Okay. What is that? Why is it just like a
[3691.37s -> 3707.03s]  Wii U drawing? Oh shit. Okay. Hathi's beat slows. Not yet. Now let's convince and then pacify
[3708.15s -> 3713.80s]  on Hathi. You told Rudin to quit fighting. It was utterly swayed. Rousy cast pacify.
[3714.76s -> 3726.15s]  I guess that makes sense. Uh, pardon us. Uh, fall asleep. You don't do anything.
[3730.55s -> 3735.86s]  Oh, we just had a bunch of community subs. Novi gave five community subs. Thanks a lot.
[3736.74s -> 3742.94s]  Thank you so much Novi and congratulations to the people that are getting these community subs.
[3744.33s -> 3752.74s]  Thank you. Puzzle time. We got a puzzle here. Check it out. Check the clock. In order to
[3752.74s -> 3765.98s]  solve this puzzle, you'll have to hurry. They've got so much time in The Legend of
[3765.98s -> 3779.14s]  Zelda. I beat Star Tropic's first try blind without taking any damage. Behold the maze of
[3779.14s -> 3793.13s]  death. Prepare to get lost clowns. Signed, Lancer. Uh-oh. Failing lost yet? You must be utterly helpless
[3793.13s -> 3798.73s]  among these twists and turns. Your sense of direction will save you now. What's that?
[3798.73s -> 3805.93s]  It's some sort of enemy. Looks like they got clobbered. Oh, I see. Well, I'm assuming
[3805.93s -> 3810.14s]  I have to follow the signs, but I kind of want to see what's over here. Well, wait a
[3810.14s -> 3814.46s]  minute. Even if you're my enemy, I've got to warn you. A purple beast is roaming clobbering
[3814.46s -> 3820.94s]  anyone who dares block her way. We don't even like fighting. The king left us no choice.
[3821.90s -> 3831.26s]  Oh, Chris, we need to stop Susie quick. Hey, wait, where am I? Help. Somebody help me. I'm lost.
[3832.94s -> 3837.30s]  Oh, and there are coins. You open the treasure chest. Inside was a white
[3837.30s -> 3841.54s]  ribbon. You put white ribbon in your armor. That ribbon is armor, Chris.
[3842.42s -> 3847.06s]  It increases defense. Why don't you try wearing it in the equipment menu? Yeah, I will. I think
[3847.06s -> 3856.70s]  it'd look great on you. Okay, so this is Chris. And we got white ribbon is
[3857.42s -> 3863.64s]  crinkly hair ribbon that slightly increases your defense and cuteness. What the fuck does
[3863.64s -> 3886.30s]  that mean? I've higher cuteness. Oh, no. Well, Rousey apparently is cuter now. Chris,
[3886.30s -> 3898.57s]  you're giving it to me? Well, does it look pretty? I better get that back. That's a loan,
[3898.57s -> 3907.69s]  man. I want three ribbons back with interest. Hey, don't look. This sign's private. I already did.
[3908.41s -> 3917.69s]  Oh, it's just this way. There is. Oh, somehow you survived the babies, but don't count on
[3917.69s -> 3924.92s]  your blessings before they hatch. Let's see if you're against this team. My triple frogs.
[3925.80s -> 3935.35s]  Three Hatties blocked the way. So we can go to act. Let's do flatter. Let's flatter.
[3936.23s -> 3941.93s]  And let's get some defense here. You told the Hattie it has cool tentacles. It began to think
[3941.93s -> 3949.53s]  about this. That was that one up top is. Is that like a Grinch meter? I don't understand
[3949.53s -> 3952.81s]  the Grinch meter. Hey, why aren't you guys thrashed? You're totally outnumbered.
[3953.69s -> 3958.09s]  You made a team purely of support enemies. Their bullet patterns aren't balanced at all.
[3958.09s -> 3964.73s]  It's like a dinner made out of three glasses of milk. And that's how unusual somehow.
[3964.73s -> 3974.79s]  Why don't we talk about this after the battle? Okay. Let me pacify.
[3975.91s -> 3984.76s]  Pacify, but the enemy wasn't tired. Okay. Well, one of the middle's angry,
[3985.40s -> 3997.83s]  but it doesn't matter. These things until I figure it out. Flatter. And began to think
[3997.83s -> 4012.25s]  about this. Now it's very happy that I said that. Hattie's body beats audibly.
[4013.70s -> 4020.17s]  X-flatter. You order Raazi to flatter all the enemies. Oh, you can do... I get it. You don't need
[4020.17s -> 4027.37s]  experience just encountering your smile is rewarding enough. Why does somebody just say...
[4028.65s -> 4042.18s]  All right, spare them both. There, spare, spare. Great job, Hurst. We earned zero XP and $88.
[4043.46s -> 4050.33s]  Sweet! How much do I get? You lost. You don't get anything. Oh, can I have some of yours?
[4051.29s -> 4066.33s]  No. Fine. Later, losers. I'm still just standing here. Sup? I thought you were running away.
[4067.13s -> 4067.93s]  Yeah, I finished.
[4071.82s -> 4083.64s]  All right, that's... That's fine. That was funny. Come on, that was cute. My cuteness
[4083.64s -> 4121.62s]  was up, but that's why. No, get over that. That's scripted. That's scripted, guys. Excuse me.
[4121.62s -> 4127.53s]  That's scripted. He can't solve it. I physically can't solve it.
[4130.84s -> 4138.84s]  Come on, man. Open your door, you stupid door. Oh, great. It's you guys. Susie, we were ever so
[4138.84s -> 4144.52s]  worried about you. How'd you get past those spikes before? Walk through them. But this door
[4144.52s -> 4150.84s]  sucks. Oh, don't worry, Susie. A little bit after we solved the puzzle over there. Nice.
[4150.84s -> 4157.48s]  Tell me when you finish it. Susie, we need you to finish it. Sometimes proceeding
[4157.48s -> 4161.48s]  will take all three of us. Furthermore, only Chris can seal the dark fountain.
[4161.48s -> 4166.90s]  So if you don't accompany us, you won't make it home. So you're saying I have to stick with you,
[4166.90s -> 4177.88s]  Rune? Yep. Let's just get this over with. Yahoo! Susie's... Yeah!
[4180.36s -> 4198.36s]  Susie's back on the team. Cue the fanfare. Susie joined the party. That was long. Susie
[4199.08s -> 4215.59s]  follows at a distance such that no one can tell she's associated. Not anymore.
[4216.63s -> 4232.98s]  All right, here we go. Three, two, one, action! Action! Did it! Step on it!
[4244.86s -> 4249.18s]  Hey, Chris, if you need help with the puzzle, feel free to ask me. No. And if you need help
[4249.18s -> 4255.48s]  from me, you're screwed. Just wait. Let me... how... it's got to be like this.
[4288.65s -> 4300.63s]  Yeah! I can't do it. I'm just gonna scream Yahoo! But I would have like peaked the microphone so
[4300.63s -> 4308.41s]  loudly. Let's go, dog! Oh, Chris just realized Susie missed the tutorial.
[4309.37s -> 4321.83s]  Next battle, we should show her how to act. I think she might really enjoy that. C-Round
[4321.83s -> 4329.61s]  attacked violently. You recall Rousey's advice to include Susie in an act. Okay, act. No, no,
[4329.61s -> 4338.62s]  don't hurt. C-Round. Compliment. You recall, uh, Rousey, you're just going to defend.
[4338.62s -> 4345.59s]  You ordered Susie to flatter the enemy. What? Why the hell would I do that? It attacked us!
[4345.59s -> 4351.59s]  Let's smash it before it moves! Oh, look, Susie, it seems harmless. If you act nice,
[4351.59s -> 4358.55s]  we might win without hurting it. Okay, hey, little guy, I really like the axe on your face.
[4359.51s -> 4377.02s]  Oh, am I gonna get the bad ending because of that? The bad ending. Hehehe, I sneaked
[4377.02s -> 4396.89s]  by and made a sign. Weirdo. Wow, look at that guy over there. Susie, listen. As heroes,
[4396.89s -> 4402.41s]  we have the power to make a peaceful future. So, from now on, let's try avoiding fighting.
[4404.94s -> 4409.58s]  Uh, what if you just took it easy on me? If you weaken an enemy, I can use my pacify spell,
[4409.58s -> 4414.41s]  which can put exhausted people to sleep. Yawn, yeah, you talking is already doing that.
[4415.21s -> 4418.81s]  Well, um, just think about it. You might have to warn enemies about her.
[4426.52s -> 4431.72s]  The violent tormentor is now your ally. The power of mean girls shines within you.
[4450.25s -> 4458.81s]  Hey. Hey, kid. You wanna buy a tutorial? It's only 50 dark dollars. Really? You're
[4458.81s -> 4471.78s]  really gonna buy it? Right this way, gentlemen. Uh, we're sorry, we're normally puzzle guys, but
[4472.42s -> 4476.58s]  we've been forced to do tutorials just to make ends meet. When the king got power,
[4476.58s -> 4480.98s]  he fired everyone and replaced all puzzle makers with him. Rooks will scar the lord of the
[4480.98s -> 4489.67s]  puzzles. Be careful. I'm TP master. Ask me about TP. Secret. TP only lasts inside a fight.
[4489.67s -> 4495.62s]  Once you win, it's out of sight. Having extra feels unbearable. No point in saving. It's
[4495.62s -> 4500.50s]  straight up terrible. The leftover TP turns into extra money at the end of a battle.
[4501.46s -> 4514.42s]  You mean I only should have been using one square? I'm Ralsei master. Ask me about Ralsei's
[4515.62s -> 4522.90s]  fact. Ralsei loves when you give us money. He will hug you and call you honey. Hey,
[4522.90s -> 4528.98s]  that's not true. You don't need money to get me to do that. I'm Susie master. Ask me anything
[4528.98s -> 4536.14s]  about Susie. Uh, fact. Susie loves when you give us money. She will. Nope, don't care.
[4536.78s -> 4544.86s]  Did I say something funny? I don't have any hats. I'm Chris master. Ask me anything about
[4544.86s -> 4550.86s]  Chris. Fact. It's a good idea to give us bucks. It'll make you happy and fill you
[4550.86s -> 4555.82s]  with lucks. Over there is our donation hole. We had a box, but it got stole.
[4556.46s -> 4568.55s]  Hole goals. $1 monthly tutorial weekly. $10 weekly tutorial monthly. $100 stop making tutorials.
[4569.35s -> 4577.14s]  Donation hole. If you like our tutorials, please throw your money into a hole. You put
[4577.14s -> 4585.93s]  a dollar in the hole. The hole became full. The hole is filled to the brim with cash.
[4586.49s -> 4592.25s]  I put a dollar in. The king didn't even give us severance pay. His son just gave us all
[4592.25s -> 4600.10s]  beanies. Itchy beanies. That was a fake. That was just a large cartoon dollar.
[4600.82s -> 4608.12s]  You guys know fun fact. That's not even true. Never mind. It's a lie.
[4614.36s -> 4625.98s]  Never mind. Hihi, welcome travelers. Whatever you got. A star shaped candy that heals 40 HP.
[4626.70s -> 4634.62s]  Mysterious hamburger heals 70 HP. Defensive charm that a spooky sword.
[4635.42s -> 4648.92s]  I feel like this is probably important. Do I have 200 bucks? I already have two candies.
[4650.20s -> 4657.62s]  You get a burger. That's a lot of money though. $70 for a hamburger? That's kind of insane.
[4658.98s -> 4674.26s]  Burger. I'm gonna buy one of these cards too. What about yourself? The name's Sheem, pronounced
[4674.26s -> 4682.42s]  Sean. And this is my little sheep. It's haha. Over the years I've collected odds and ends.
[4683.06s -> 4685.86s]  Of course I have no attachment to any of it. It's just a hobby of mine.
[4686.74s -> 4690.50s]  Around here you learn to find ways to pass the time or go mad like everyone else.
[4694.14s -> 4701.72s]  Long ago the darkners lived in harmony with the lightners. They were like gods to us. Our
[4701.72s -> 4706.38s]  protectors, our creators, those who gave us purpose. And one day we were all locked away in
[4706.38s -> 4714.14s]  this prison and the lightners never returned. Embittered, the king took up arms and aims to
[4714.14s -> 4719.34s]  take revenge upon the lightners that left us behind. Of course even among his troops
[4719.34s -> 4727.74s]  some still distantly hope the lightners will return. You're legendary, ha ha ha. So you
[4727.74s -> 4732.06s]  are the heroes who are going to seal our fountain. Ha good luck, it makes no difference
[4732.06s -> 4741.72s]  to me. Neither light nor dark hold a future for a dark nerd in my condition. Historically this land
[4741.72s -> 4746.60s]  was ruled by the four kings from Card Castle to the east but recently a strange knight
[4746.60s -> 4752.36s]  appeared and three of the kings were locked away. The remaining king put him and his strange son
[4752.36s -> 4759.48s]  into power. This land has seen this much chaos since. Laughing about it just a little
[4759.48s -> 4776.17s]  bit. Well you don't need to know about that. Let's give it a save. Power of mean girls.
[4780.47s -> 4790.06s]  Chaos chaos chaos. What do you mean chaos? We're sorry we're normally puzzle guys but yeah
[4790.06s -> 4799.14s]  just want to make sure I didn't miss anything. Gaining TP. You get TP when you defend
[4799.86s -> 4803.86s]  then you can cast spells. Yeah that's what I figured. Look for the heart outline when you
[4803.86s -> 4811.82s]  get close to bullets. Oh wait hold on because it's important. So when you barely get hit by
[4811.82s -> 4819.78s]  something it gives you defense points. Say that again. You get TP when you defend protect yourself
[4819.78s -> 4824.10s]  and cast spells. You also get TP by getting close to bullets. Look for the heart outline.
[4824.10s -> 4841.51s]  Okay so I wasn't getting actually I wasn't getting hit by anything. Okay okay so as long
[4841.51s -> 4851.93s]  as I get close enough from the door. It's a lone door frame but for some reason you can't
[4851.93s -> 4865.75s]  see through it. Well flip my flapjacks. The clowns are back in town. Well bad news since you last
[4865.75s -> 4870.31s]  saw me several minutes ago. I've created a brand new fighting team ready to stop me.
[4870.31s -> 4874.31s]  Not even the purple girl can stop me now. Oh what are you ready for me?
[4875.75s -> 4883.19s]  Stop talking. Ho ho ho. What is that? Why are you saying that? Ho ho ho. It's my evil laugh.
[4883.27s -> 4889.86s]  Scary right? Sound like baby santa claus. Oh you mean like in a badass way?
[4890.98s -> 4901.03s]  Shut up. Really think you know how to be scary? Well I uh wrong.
[4902.07s -> 4907.66s]  Maybe tough guys like you really piss me off. They said you wouldn't know scary.
[4908.22s -> 4913.05s]  They picked you up and bit your face off. Why why does she want to eat people? That's not
[4913.05s -> 4924.26s]  true. Really? Then why don't you prove it? Eat this person? Well start with the part
[4924.82s -> 4937.24s]  where your face gets bit off. Oh okay I get it. Thank you purple girl. What?
[4938.22s -> 4942.14s]  Thanks it was kind of you to teach me how to be scary with an evil laugh.
[4943.69s -> 4957.53s]  Hey I wasn't and now you're going to be thrashed. Ah ah Merry Christmas.
[4958.01s -> 4976.18s]  I guess that's kind of an improvement. A board of jigsaws walked away. I'm gonna
[4976.18s -> 4985.18s]  probably warn. Warn the jigsaw? You and Rousey warned the enemies about Susie. Everyone went
[4985.18s -> 4997.82s]  on guard. Fighting? I love fighting. I have a rent payment to make. How? Trying to calculate
[4997.82s -> 5008.38s]  this month's rent. So they've been warned. Now let's be friends. I'm gonna just defend here.
[5009.86s -> 5017.94s]  Barely lift the finger and well look we have to be friends. Good. I always want to be friends
[5017.94s -> 5027.72s]  just like you. We're friends now. I do want to get barely hit. Uh jigsaw is pretending to
[5027.72s -> 5045.11s]  march. They're all good to go. Oh wait uh oh uh oh uh oh uh oh thank god. We're friends
[5045.11s -> 5063.66s]  now. Voila. Jigsaw is wishing it could quit its job. Double spare. You won. You got 73 dollars.
[5069.70s -> 5075.38s]  All right now where's Papyrus 2? Oh no not one of these. Oh look Chris another puzzle.
[5076.82s -> 5083.77s]  Oh no. Let's read the instructions. Oh the instructions are vandalized. It says
[5084.81s -> 5090.57s]  thou fools thou will never figure out how to do it. Now ruining instructions does
[5090.57s -> 5098.49s]  definitely against the rules. Then it says ps I make my own rules. RK. Well that explains that.
[5099.13s -> 5106.26s]  Why don't we just climb over this spiked fence? Not because then we'd get impaled and die.
[5107.30s -> 5114.73s]  Cool I'll work on that and you do the puzzle. Try your best. Why can't you just stand over
[5114.73s -> 5127.96s]  there? Great job Chris. I think you're on to something. I know I'm on to something.
[5128.68s -> 5132.60s]  Give up whenever you feel like it. So I'll go what's with this angel and devil bullshit?
[5138.73s -> 5148.18s]  You did it Chris. Great job. Damn didn't get to impale myself. Jesus. Good job Chris.
[5150.82s -> 5164.04s]  Galaxy brain. Always check the top. Always check around. From the bottom the order of our rooms
[5164.04s -> 5185.51s]  in card castle. Of course if you haven't been there you won't know it. Okay uh really emphasizing
[5185.51s -> 5195.18s]  that it's impossible if you haven't been there. So I have to see where all the rooms are.
[5199.00s -> 5206.70s]  Is it impossible though? I'm killing this guy. No I'm not. What would Sans do?
[5207.74s -> 5231.59s]  Warn the enemies about Susie. Matthew has a little secret. Okay let's. Is it lecture or
[5231.59s -> 5237.26s]  convince? I just convinced. You told Rudin to quit fighting. He was utterly swayed.
[5238.38s -> 5250.92s]  Yeah I guess that makes sense. Long live the guy who paid this. Shit. Okay so I can spare
[5251.00s -> 5260.81s]  Rudin and then. Spare Rudin and then. Are they are they warned right now?
[5261.61s -> 5280.25s]  Yeah they're warned. I could always pacify. No one's tired. Just kill them. That defeats.
[5280.89s -> 5283.61s]  Look I played the first game and I know that.
[5285.85s -> 5288.97s]  Spoilers for the first game. Why would you be watching this if you don't know about the
[5288.97s -> 5303.56s]  first game? Uh if you. Whatever. You know what I'm about to say. Wow Undertale spoilers.
[5304.52s -> 5308.70s]  Well don't act like you never played it. All right let's do extreme flatter.
[5309.34s -> 5317.54s]  You don't need XP just encountering your smile is rewarding enough.
[5318.50s -> 5330.70s]  Now let's my face my diamond cutter. Yeah yeah yeah. All right so spare. Spare.
[5332.66s -> 5337.75s]  Congratulations you win the game. Wait Undertale's a game? Uh it's an app.
[5338.55s -> 5347.43s]  That's the proper way to say it. So I mean it's an app man. Uh all right let me.
[5347.99s -> 5356.55s]  I guess we're just gonna go this way. Sign. When you step into the light you'll return to
[5356.55s -> 5369.22s]  where you were before. I don't think I want to do that though. All right so we gotta go.
[5369.22s -> 5383.62s]  We gotta wait till we get an opportunity right now. Okay more of that. More of this.
[5384.42s -> 5395.45s]  Uh oh. Hon man drew near. All right we got hon man lullaby or let's do warning.
[5407.05s -> 5414.73s]  Oh I wasn't ready for that one. Hypnotize by your idle animation. All right so we can do uh
[5414.73s -> 5422.17s]  let's lullaby. Let's lullaby. Saying a soft and entrancing lullaby. Hon man fell asleep.
[5422.17s -> 5433.99s]  Suzy fell asleep and we just became tired. Okay well that's good. Can't keep its eyes open
[5436.58s -> 5447.59s]  and I can pacify. Now she won't attack. That's good. Though she kind of has low HP.
[5452.78s -> 5463.58s]  You kind of got low HP. Now we got another flash here. Back and forth. One two one two one two.
[5463.58s -> 5476.20s]  Sure thing. There's Santa. So you've begun to cross the great board.
[5477.16s -> 5487.42s]  The halfway point to our castle. Impressive. So it's a shame you won't make it a step further
[5487.42s -> 5492.70s]  because my guys are about to smash you into blood. Lots of blood. Splooshing blood. Very gross and
[5492.70s -> 5504.52s]  bad. Hey purple girl was that scarier? You're asking me because you're really cool at being
[5504.52s -> 5516.34s]  terrifying. I want to be as scary as you. You want to be like me? Yeah. Well that's stupid.
[5518.10s -> 5522.90s]  But um the new laugh isn't as awful. Saying you'd turn us into blood is uh cool.
[5524.26s -> 5532.17s]  What's up with the bucket though? It's to put the blood in. Oh yeah I'm not uh not supposed
[5532.17s -> 5538.17s]  to make a mess. Anyway thanks for your feedback. I'm really feeling scary. No problem I
[5538.17s -> 5547.16s]  guess. That's that. I write that. That's I do haha. So are you guys gonna attack us or uh oh
[5547.16s -> 5552.12s]  yeah oh yeah I was so excited I forgot to bring any guys but next time it'll be the end for
[5554.04s -> 5558.36s]  Hey I've just been calling you guys clowns. Does your team have an official name or something?
[5559.80s -> 5563.22s]  Oh Chris we should come up with a name. No we shouldn't.
[5563.94s -> 5566.34s]  Then it's decided everyone puts a name in the bucket.
[5567.62s -> 5576.84s]  All right everyone's put in their entry. Blue person you can choose since you look like you
[5576.84s -> 5586.17s]  don't care. Uh crumpled paper neat paper or lancer labeled paper. Definitely this one.
[5586.17s -> 5592.49s]  You take the paper what lancer have written on the outside. You open it up. On the inside it
[5592.49s -> 5599.66s]  also says lancer. Wow who did that one it's really good. Wait why did you get to choose
[5599.66s -> 5607.10s]  the name? Yeah he didn't. Chris did. Yeah it doesn't matter who may have written it. Regardless
[5607.10s -> 5610.94s]  lancer is going to meet absolute doom. This name feels weird actually.
[5613.50s -> 5627.80s]  I know let's call it the lancer fan club for short. See you later me. The power of the lancer
[5627.80s -> 5647.69s]  fan club shines within you. It sure does. Watch out. Oh oh let me watch it. So three two.
[5648.41s -> 5655.56s]  So it's safe up there. It's safe up in the in the corner there. So just stand here. So
[5655.56s -> 5662.68s]  then it's safe in the middle. No it's not. It's safe in the. I mean it is. It is now.
[5664.50s -> 5670.42s]  Oh same. I'm getting like electrocuted. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.
[5670.42s -> 5690.04s]  Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. This streamer man. What? You gotta say something. Say it to my
[5690.04s -> 5700.87s]  face. If you're gonna say something say it to my face. That's uh doing rounds he warned
[5700.87s -> 5704.39s]  the enemies about Susie. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Show us your face then.
[5704.39s -> 5711.64s]  Uh I gave italics my weapon. I was gonna turn it on.
[5713.88s -> 5719.26s]  It's not here. Uh vomit listens politely despite having no ears.
[5722.42s -> 5743.16s]  Now he can act but he's asleep. Susie fell asleep. They're all tired and can't keep
[5743.16s -> 5754.22s]  his eyes open. Good. You're out. Good. Uh you're out. Nice joker reference.
[5760.07s -> 5768.26s]  Stop. I got hit. I shouldn't have gotten hit by that. Pawn man can't keep his eyes open.
[5768.26s -> 5782.54s]  Let's. I'm gonna put you back to sleep again. See ya. I need to heal uh Susie. Susie's hurt.
[5783.10s -> 5796.81s]  Why was that thing? Great board two. It's fireman. Look at this dude.
[5797.61s -> 5805.22s]  Oh they're horsey. Pawn men are scary but all in all they're doing is following the king.
[5806.02s -> 5812.12s]  Us on the board used to have our own boss. Those were the peaceful times but now even
[5812.12s -> 5819.40s]  the boss has been reduced to the king's peon. My name? Mr. Elegance. Haha and these these are
[5819.40s -> 5836.09s]  my nostrils not my eyes. Can still see out of them though. Interesting. Fear not we unlike
[5836.09s -> 5842.17s]  the simple pawn man possess full faculty over our actions. I Mr. Society am far too intelligent
[5842.17s -> 5849.58s]  to ever bow down to such a tyrant unless he asks me. He's very scary you see. What? You
[5849.58s -> 5853.90s]  think you possess the power to topple that brute? Yes yes yes. I'm sure everyone will
[5853.90s -> 5865.64s]  support you. Go for it. Just as long as I don't have to participate. Okay thanks. Oh
[5865.64s -> 5871.88s]  well step on my boots. If it isn't the Lancer fan club you boys or girls had better
[5871.88s -> 5877.24s]  turn back while you can. Lancer what is it this time? Oh I'm simply warning you.
[5877.80s -> 5883.66s]  Something extremely dangerous is lying ahead. Oh it's actually really inconvenient.
[5885.30s -> 5894.18s]  I can't go home at all because I'm so scared. What is it? We already fought this dog. Hey
[5894.18s -> 5901.67s]  it's the little guy. That's what you're afraid of. Wow purple girl you aren't scared?
[5901.67s -> 5921.30s]  Why would I be? What's it gonna do? Well normally it crushes people to death I think.
[5923.11s -> 5937.46s]  Here it comes. K-round. Deep bow warning. Let's let's give it let's do a warning.
[5937.46s -> 5940.98s]  You explain to K-round about the importance of dodging Suzy's attacks but it didn't seem
[5940.98s -> 5957.53s]  to understand. Well oh god okay it just jumps. Well let's bow. You and Rousey bowed. K-round
[5957.53s -> 5962.89s]  bowed back. Its crown loosened. That's it Chris. If we can get its crown off it should
[5962.89s -> 5969.54s]  turn back into a little guy. Suzy help us bow at it. Now its crown will come off when I smash
[5969.54s -> 5985.08s]  the guy to the ground. Well I'm gonna have to put you to sleep. Can I? I don't have like a lullaby
[5985.88s -> 5997.64s]  because we can do deep bow. The crown is 20% loose. Is there anything I can do to make you?
[5997.64s -> 6007.96s]  I guess I can. Here I'll do this. I'm gonna bow. Pacify. Can I pacify? I figured maybe I
[6007.96s -> 6027.59s]  could um pacify Suzy. All right bow and then heal prayer. I can't heal. Heal ally.
[6029.99s -> 6039.69s]  Well looks like we're doing the super bow. Bowed back. Its crown loosened.
[6043.02s -> 6050.20s]  Ah felt stressed out and attacked. K-round practiced self-care. What was that? Was that
[6050.20s -> 6058.17s]  like almond milk? K-round's HP and attack went up. Suzy stop attacking it you're making
[6058.17s -> 6069.70s]  it stronger. Let it think I'm afraid? No way. The crown is 40% loose. Just into the deep bow.
[6073.21s -> 6093.48s]  K-round bowed back. The crown loosened again. Whoa. Oof. Oof. Oof. Oof. No no. Um don't bow
[6093.48s -> 6105.51s]  and then I'm gonna heal because you just won't listen. Heal prayer. You just won't listen.
[6105.59s -> 6113.94s]  Oh my god why was I not paying attention? I just think I was staring. Crown is 75% loose.
[6118.76s -> 6123.24s]  Uh deep bow should do it right? Well then I'll be at 95. Well I think we're fine. Deep bow.
[6124.04s -> 6134.06s]  K-round bowed back. Its crown loosened one more time. Time to get in the dryer now.
[6134.70s -> 6143.99s]  I can't imagine doing that. This is probably some fucking guy on YouTube that was like
[6143.99s -> 6148.79s]  you've been going into me bill crazy and today I'm getting in a fucking dryer.
[6148.79s -> 6157.40s]  That's right. I'm sure it exists. And we're gonna turn it normally we're gonna turn the dryer on.
[6157.40s -> 6174.39s]  We're gonna put it on high heat and high speed. I'm gonna bow this deep bow again.
[6174.39s -> 6194.38s]  I'm not doing this bullshit. I ain't going on like the permanent press. I think I won.
[6194.38s -> 6197.26s]  Have I made this joke before about getting in the dryer if I lost?
[6197.90s -> 6202.79s]  You clowns really are heroes. You saved the next 20 minutes of my life.
[6203.75s -> 6208.01s]  We? What do you mean we? We? What do they say we?
[6208.89s -> 6214.09s]  Yeah Bill I'm making a reference to Bill crazy again because he's gonna be in the rumble
[6214.09s -> 6217.29s]  next weekend. Like I have to I have to bring some of these characters that you haven't heard
[6217.29s -> 6220.25s]  of in a while back so you know when you see them in the rumble that like it's like oh
[6220.25s -> 6226.95s]  there he is. Oh yeah if you weren't at the green screen stream this next weekend here is
[6227.83s -> 6235.67s]  Germany in 2018. That's like 600 characters. That's a lie. I'm lying a lot tonight.
[6235.67s -> 6236.63s]  I gotta stop lying to you.
[6237.88s -> 6243.00s]  Uh Suzy enough downplay your contributions but you uh you didn't actually help at all.
[6243.00s -> 6247.00s]  You only made everything worse by attacking. If you had just acted nice to it in the
[6247.00s -> 6249.96s]  first place you could have avoided that entire battle.
[6251.96s -> 6258.20s]  Are you for real? That thing was bloodthirsty. The only thing keeping it at bay was my axe.
[6259.56s -> 6265.13s]  And earlier you terrorized those troops. Those guys were enemies therefore terrorizing.
[6266.01s -> 6270.09s]  Yeah she's right. And before that you ate an innocent person's cake.
[6271.93s -> 6273.37s]  Cakes are also my enemy.
[6275.67s -> 6281.80s]  Suzy whether you like it or not you're a hero. One with the power to bring peace to the future.
[6283.32s -> 6285.08s]  Could you please start acting like one?
[6287.24s -> 6291.40s]  Yeah when you lay it out like that I've been a pretty bad hero haven't I?
[6291.40s -> 6300.17s]  Alright you got it. I'll change my ways. From now on I won't be such a rotten hero anymore.
[6301.45s -> 6303.21s]  I'll just be one of the bad guys instead.
[6305.53s -> 6308.41s]  Really? You're going to be on my team?
[6309.13s -> 6315.37s]  Yeah sounds way easier honestly. Suzy you can't just...
[6316.33s -> 6322.09s]  Quiet toothpaste boy. Suzy is my comrade now. Hey yeah toothpaste boy.
[6323.05s -> 6326.89s]  We're going to have monogrammed track jackets.
[6329.14s -> 6332.10s]  Yeah at sleepovers where we tell each other the secrets.
[6332.90s -> 6338.34s]  Um yeah anyway uh see you guys never if you can even last that long.
[6342.87s -> 6344.55s]  Perhaps I shouldn't have been so hard on her.
[6346.89s -> 6352.25s]  But I just worry that if Suzy is too eager to fight then well let's just be kind to her
[6352.33s -> 6354.89s]  okay. I'm sure Suzy will come around soon.
[6360.87s -> 6367.64s]  Well blocking foliage grows thick above your head. The power of the forest shines within you.
[6369.08s -> 6374.90s]  101 minutes and 37 hours. It's not that bad.
[6374.90s -> 6378.02s]  Hey kid we met us to fix up this old thing of a jig for you.
[6378.66s -> 6381.86s]  It's some kind of door. It can take you anywhere you want in the world.
[6381.86s -> 6383.62s]  As long as that's one of the two locations.
[6384.18s -> 6387.78s]  Anywho we'll keep working on it. Anything to help you out kid.
[6391.93s -> 6395.13s]  Oh there horsey. Mr. Society and the puzzle guy fixed that door.
[6395.69s -> 6398.89s]  Since it was just the three of us it should work without any issues.
[6399.61s -> 6402.49s]  Anyhow I hope it helps you deal with the king.
[6404.78s -> 6408.14s]  Now don't tell anyone Mr. Society helped. He doesn't want none of that.
[6408.14s -> 6410.63s]  I'm watching you now with my nostrils.
[6411.19s -> 6422.33s]  It's a door. Where will you go?
[6423.54s -> 6426.74s]  Field forest. Uh field. The door open.
[6427.46s -> 6433.58s]  Okay so this okay this is the door to go back.
[6434.30s -> 6445.29s]  All right. Ah! Uh oh.
[6445.29s -> 6446.89s]  Rabbic slithered in the way.
[6449.03s -> 6453.51s]  Uh breathe all? Press zebra peel to blow air.
[6454.39s -> 6462.90s]  Freshing boy. How does that mean?
[6463.62s -> 6467.30s]  Looking for a couch to get stuck under.
[6468.66s -> 6471.91s]  All right. No no no no! Okay I did it.
[6472.63s -> 6479.42s]  Press the button too many times.
[6479.42s -> 6483.86s]  I did attack and I thought I was gonna punch the person.
[6483.86s -> 6484.18s]  All right.
[6488.22s -> 6489.26s]  Suzy! Lancer!
[6491.67s -> 6492.23s]  Hey hey hey.
[6493.11s -> 6495.67s]  Well if it isn't the so-called heroes.
[6495.67s -> 6497.77s]  Are you finally ready to see what happens?
[6498.57s -> 6503.21s]  When you try to act soft against a team that crushes anyone in their way.
[6504.57s -> 6505.85s]  Dark Jack Lancer.
[6506.49s -> 6507.77s]  Violent Axe Suzy.

[6532.98s -> 6534.92s]  You won't have to look forward to it for long.
[6535.96s -> 6539.24s]  Starting now we're going to work ceaselessly.
[6539.24s -> 6540.36s]  I couldn't say that.
[6540.36s -> 6544.84s]  Unstoppably to make an evil plan to thrash you clowns.

[9121.98s -> 9144.39s]  easy let's spare them i do like the sort of uh left and right side of the screen

[9160.66s -> 9171.21s]  find the secret no hey losers wait a sec where's the lancer well he wasn't going the right way so
[9172.17s -> 9177.05s]  you let him wander off by himself you know he's bad at mazes right he's probably lost and
[9177.05s -> 9182.92s]  confused right now i've lost and confused sorry susie we didn't mean to make you worry
[9182.92s -> 9188.26s]  about him oh look i'm not uh worried about him bad guys got to look out for each other
[9189.06s -> 9194.57s]  there's all anyway get out of my way i'm gonna find him see if she doesn't know the right way
[9194.57s -> 9209.00s]  either well they go go the way that they're not going what what was the hitbox on that come on man
[9213.74s -> 9228.20s]  ah go back can i go back uh whatever i keep forgetting because i could have just done uh
[9228.76s -> 9243.64s]  spare instead of uh sitting here like this in defense mode sorry germa for asking if you're
[9243.64s -> 9247.24s]  pissed off and causing a wave of people telling you to calm down we all love you can't wait for
[9247.24s -> 9256.02s]  germania no i'm just kidding around i didn't i don't remember where they even went well i was
[9256.02s -> 9261.78s]  wrong damn i was sure he went this way no way he could save his own damn self i went the wrong
[9261.78s -> 9289.56s]  fucking way too oh no oh shit okay i could do the whole thing again right up the middle
[9290.44s -> 9300.95s]  and then on the right i don't want to fight you and then oh shit where are they go to the left
[9302.07s -> 9317.94s]  right at the middle i got it got it bad because mad bad is mad mad because bad
[9318.58s -> 9323.06s]  oh look it's our toy with the toy we made isn't that the machine we designed all right
[9323.06s -> 9333.18s]  this will be tough but let's try our best oh that's uh it's not good actually oh you
[9333.18s -> 9341.94s]  think that's bad just wait and see what happens when it starts the design sucked so we blew it up
[9343.24s -> 9351.51s]  oh i see so now what's your plan going to be turns out we didn't need a plan just a rule
[9352.63s -> 9359.45s]  anyone that gets in our way gets crushed into dust that's a pretty good rule but suzy you
[9359.45s -> 9364.81s]  need us to return home doesn't crushing us seem a little counterproductive nah so that's where
[9364.89s -> 9372.25s]  you're wrong you see i know i can't get back without you guys but being a good guy really
[9372.25s -> 9379.06s]  isn't my style so i thought of a little way we can just settle this if you can beat me i'll go
[9379.06s -> 9385.54s]  back to being a good guy but if you lose you guys will have to become bad guys with us
[9386.42s -> 9393.03s]  and do whatever we say oh our wish is your command so what do you say
[9393.43s -> 9409.43s]  um okay we were just gonna thrash you anyways see ya two bad guys blocked away
[9410.07s -> 9419.74s]  i've got suzy and we have lancer lancer probably easier to deal with x anything anything anything
[9420.54s -> 9426.68s]  i'm told ralcy to compliment the enemies you two look like a really great team i'm proud
[9427.24s -> 9432.92s]  lancer started to become a little convinced oh it's working on me flattery won't work
[9439.32s -> 9451.75s]  uh suzy and lancer are making fun of you uh let's try suzy sing let's try to sing
[9453.05s -> 9458.89s]  ralcy saying a soft and entrancing lullaby doesn't she go to sleep suzy fell asleep
[9460.01s -> 9469.93s]  oh what a beautiful song smells like teamwork all right uh so suzy's asleep
[9470.89s -> 9480.81s]  so now lancer can i you told the logically best lancer and suzy you too if we don't stop fighting
[9480.81s -> 9493.00s]  then someone might get hurt lancer became more convinced it's working really that's bad ow
[9493.00s -> 9504.62s]  having an evil laugh contest well she's asleep same thing do again you told her to offer his
[9504.62s -> 9509.82s]  you told ralcy to offer his services to the enemies you too if we stop fighting then i could
[9509.82s -> 9516.78s]  uh i could braid your hair lancer became almost fully convinced wow i'll look amazing i'm awake
[9516.78s -> 9536.90s]  did i miss anything all right let's do the same thing sing suzy to sleep good night what a beautiful
[9536.90s -> 9545.56s]  song whoa why for some reason thought it was a dumb an idiot let's convince lancer told
[9545.56s -> 9551.19s]  ralcy to come deal a final blow of kindness i in summary i'd like you to and i think we
[9551.27s -> 9558.39s]  should all just get along uh oh what's wrong dude i accidentally started liking the enemies
[9559.27s -> 9564.78s]  now seeing them just makes me feel round and soft bad atmosphere for battle though
[9566.82s -> 9575.32s]  well if you don't want to fight there's no point i guess battles over well you didn't
[9575.32s -> 9583.72s]  beat us because you uh kind of cheated by ganging up on lancer with uh kindness but if
[9583.72s -> 9587.48s]  i have to i guess i'll go back to your side but don't expect me to do anything but fight
[9588.04s -> 9596.30s]  well we're happy to have you back suzy yeah yeah let's just hurry up and go home
[9596.30s -> 9604.12s]  i know what about him um suzy does this mean that we aren't a team anymore
[9606.04s -> 9614.46s]  uh i mean uh of course we're still a team you can uh be part of the lancer fan club
[9615.74s -> 9622.07s]  wow me in the lancer fan club wait if i hang out with the good guys then
[9622.63s -> 9632.01s]  can we still have monogram track jackets yeah ralcy will make them huh oh okay sure

[9653.43s -> 9670.18s]  following you can follow behind us you know oh okay chad it's a lone door frame but for some reason
[9670.18s -> 9685.75s]  you can't see through it wow this is cool i've never been on such a big team before
[9686.55s -> 9691.91s]  don't you have a legion of various guys yeah but my dad forced them to listen to me
[9691.91s -> 9698.95s]  so they don't actually like me very much yeah well you don't need those clowns anymore
[9698.95s -> 9710.09s]  just chill with us aye aye he's doing the chad walk he's doing the chad thing oh no he's dot

[9723.62s -> 9735.38s]  what's the catch you have to stop making fun of me for one pass i can't stop thinking
[9735.38s -> 9740.34s]  about the chad thing uh look suzy a candy tree hell yeah
[9747.53s -> 9754.84s]  this that has to be by design right it has to be there's no way that he didn't do that on
[9754.84s -> 9762.06s]  purpose damn the last piece is too high to reach worry not suzy i have a special
[9762.06s -> 9775.94s]  transformation for times like this really watch and learn look stool form all you did was put

[9798.97s -> 9810.95s]  it to me i thought you were hungry it's her first act of real kindness i changed my mind
[9813.46s -> 9829.48s]  oh candy joins the team all right already stop so what's it taste like
[9830.68s -> 9834.52s]  yum yum yum it tastes like friendship what's that taste like

[9845.10s -> 9859.94s]  you're a good friend well uh you too i guess just walking along with you guys feels nice
[9860.66s -> 9866.73s]  like i'm doing something important because you're alongside the lighteners lancer our purpose
[9867.29s -> 9875.85s]  darkner's purpose is to assist them it's the only way we can truly feel fulfilled really
[9876.57s -> 9890.06s]  but my dad hates lighteners he wants to does your dad seem happy i'm not sure chad walk
[9890.06s -> 9894.62s]  yeah let's ditch the weird purpose talk you're probably just glad you ate a weird berry

[10075.85s -> 10082.89s]  you poor lighteners we were told to keep you in prison for eternity too bad would have loved to
[10082.89s -> 10094.82s]  see you guys punished ow define how do you do isn't it chris prison for eternity that sounds
[10094.82s -> 10110.55s]  like it might take a while and suzy where's suzy we have to find her we have to find her
[10110.55s -> 10116.47s]  chris before she gets hurt or um hurt someone else maybe there's something we can escape with
[10116.47s -> 10127.45s]  in here the shackles seem oddly fashionable take them iron shackle was put in your armor
[10130.33s -> 10133.61s]  life cannot exist without consuming even the moss drinks water
[10134.17s -> 10149.14s]  yeah perpetuate the cycle of existence you ate the moss tastes mossy your hp was mossed out
[10150.50s -> 10158.97s]  there's a crack in the wall what could be inside it's more wall well so what did you mind
[10159.85s -> 10163.61s]  what's all that green stuff around your mouth two minutes in jail and you've already resorted
[10163.61s -> 10170.14s]  to eating moss uh you're a real go-getter chris so you couldn't find anything well chris
[10170.14s -> 10174.78s]  let's not give up hope just yet but um if we don't make it out for some reason
[10174.78s -> 10182.22s]  and i just wanted to say um i'm glad i was able to meet hey idiots can you shut up i'm trying to
[10182.22s -> 10193.51s]  concentrate where is suzy i don't know prison seriously though i'm out of my cell i sweet

[10286.68s -> 10298.65s]  probably i mean probably seems like she's very she's very influenceable she joined the bad guys
[10298.65s -> 10303.77s]  because she wanted to be a bad guy i know i'm a little concerned well regardless of how you feel
[10303.77s -> 10308.01s]  i don't think it would hurt to take a moment close your eyes and think about what she's doing
[10308.01s -> 10322.36s]  now uh-oh another puzzle out of the cell where to next oh fuck and there's a scary monster over

[10931.50s -> 10937.58s]  very clever they lost the chase and locked up their entire race building a prison around the
[10937.58s -> 10943.27s]  whole world now i'm the only free one free but you're clearly the one behind bars
[10944.87s -> 10950.20s]  things don't seem such from here lighteners sounds like you don't need any help then

[10965.58s -> 10970.30s]  the key is hidden from the eyes the old shopkeeper knows a secret tear them from his
[10970.30s -> 10988.87s]  skull he is hidden from the eyes the old shopkeeper knows a secret shopkeeper he knows
[10988.87s -> 10997.96s]  a secret let's go talk to the shopkeeper where the fuck was that guy all right floor
[10998.04s -> 11024.10s]  first floor but this is hold on no no no no no no no no no prison b1 so let me just get out of
[11024.10s -> 11044.57s]  here eyes how do i get out how do i leave thanks for inviting me this trash can is really great
[11045.13s -> 11058.66s]  so i wasn't progressing when i was going to the first floor exit through the prison
[11060.50s -> 11065.30s]  let me just go to the prison and get out there's multiple exits i wanted to go this
[11065.30s -> 11077.18s]  way though oh god us animals used to be alone in these cages now everyone's here
[11077.18s -> 11081.58s]  so many new people wish we could go back to the good old days when it was just us in these
[11081.58s -> 11090.01s]  filthy cages since i didn't want to fight you guys i got locked up how can i you guys seem way
[11090.01s -> 11096.20s]  nicer than the king i was arrested for making a puzzle without a license i'll never make
[11096.20s -> 11103.86s]  another word search i promise whoa whoa whoa are the three former kings we are the three
[11103.86s -> 11109.38s]  former kings we beg you free us once all four of us ruled together but when the night arrived
[11109.38s -> 11116.23s]  everything changed oh my diamonds my jewels you must tell me if they're all right oh oh
[11127.30s -> 11142.46s]  so first floor go to the shopkeeper where's the shopkeeper am i going right way okay i'm
[11142.46s -> 11148.07s]  in the front i'm right at the front door there we go all right it's a door where will

[11164.71s -> 11172.22s]  so you got a secret start talking strange prisoner uh what are you talking about a
[11172.22s -> 11178.79s]  prisoner with an odd manner no you couldn't possibly be talking about him i see after all
[11178.79s -> 11184.23s]  the trouble i went through to lock him up you want to release him uh now that you mentioned
[11184.23s -> 11188.55s]  it it could be troublesome if he was left alone yes perhaps it's better if you heroes
[11188.55s -> 11192.95s]  dealt with him now after all it's not as if whatever happens will matter in the end
[11193.59s -> 11200.23s]  perhaps a little chaos might be fun so then take this broken key a was added to your key items
[11201.19s -> 11204.55s]  if you're so driven find the other two pieces and get someone to fix them
[11205.27s -> 11211.13s]  i'll even give you a hint walk where the stars don't shine if you succeed come back
[11211.13s -> 11216.44s]  here and i'll and tell me good luck and call this luck no it's more like a curse
[11217.40s -> 11225.38s]  but the star okay it mattered to me but here's a walk where the stars don't shine
[11227.14s -> 11247.93s]  where the stars don't shine i mean that's he's talking about darkness like is this the way

[13693.00s -> 13697.56s]  the only one who matched me in the games we used to play one day he met a strange
[13697.56s -> 13701.72s]  someone and since then he began to change started saying bizarre things that didn't
[13701.72s -> 13707.99s]  completely make sense but didn't completely not make sense either soon he began to see
[13707.99s -> 13713.11s]  the world as a game and everyone as its participants as the court major and his
[13713.11s -> 13719.27s]  only companion i was forced to lock him away or rather lock us all away in his own words
[13720.31s -> 13725.43s]  since that time the strange words he said have stuck inside my cotton and my view of
[13725.43s -> 13730.47s]  this world has become darker yet darker reflecting on these old memories i think perhaps
[13730.47s -> 13735.91s]  i miss playing games with him and i wonder if i hadn't been asked to lock him up would i

[19121.75s -> 19134.25s]  jevil item oh fuck you're right the only thing stopping me from making this joke is the jevil

[19192.78s -> 19199.45s]  like what where's the harm in playing it it's it's just free i is it is the whole thing
[19199.45s -> 19212.34s]  going to be free no maybe not probably not there's no no there's yeah there's no way to
[19213.66s -> 19223.21s]  um i thought i thought it was cute i thought it was interesting but without the whole experience
[19223.21s -> 19227.21s]  it's hard to be like well you know there's my problem with what i think about the story
[19227.21s -> 19236.14s]  like i don't how am i supposed to give you an opinion on that did i play the first game on

[21215.67s -> 21225.91s]  pecan pie and i got a chocolate cream and that was the third time they screwed the order up so

[21229.59s -> 21233.43s]  that context you don't have all you have is that little clip there of you waking up in
[21233.43s -> 21237.35s]  in that reality there i was there for about 30 minutes waiting for different pies

[21316.46s -> 21321.58s]  so please read this on stream it was the most fun i've had in our campaign yet it was
[21321.58s -> 21326.22s]  wonderful thanks for being such a creative and talented person we love you almost as much
[21326.22s -> 21336.70s]  as carl let's see see the party slayed al goro and gave trogg a burial they encountered
[21336.70s -> 21341.02s]  the rabbit people and purchased everything from the shop malice the goliath fired the ray
[21341.02s -> 21345.02s]  gun and blew the hole blew a hole in the shop's wall they were soon chased out and
[21345.02s -> 21349.34s]  encountered the horde of zombies coming face to face with al gulu i threw a single stone and
[21349.34s -> 21353.42s]  killed the demon in one hit upon reaching the final room the wizard offered the party an answer
[21353.42s -> 21358.30s]  to any question that they would ask under the condition that it was one question asking what
[21358.30s -> 21363.10s]  happened to carl instead of asking about the two people we came to the castle to save the
[21363.10s -> 21367.50s]  shotgun picked up by malice was pulled from his hand and blew a hole into the wizard's chest
[21367.50s -> 21370.62s]  reality began to distort around him as the party found themselves floating on a single
[21370.62s -> 21375.90s]  platform in a red cosmic void staring down at carl himself cursed by a powerful ring
[21375.90s -> 21381.34s]  carl attacked the party driven by greed to find more chips i pulled the ring from carl's finger
[21381.34s -> 21385.66s]  and carl dissolved into smoke before the entire dungeon began to warp and collapse into itself
[21386.22s -> 21390.06s]  running out the party narrowly escaped and returned to town to inform the barbarians of
[21390.06s -> 21395.90s]  trogg's defeat then the barbarians got absolutely pissed absolutely pissed for disturbing
[21395.90s -> 21400.54s]  the ritual of the warrior's harvest with that we completed the castle griffin's deed
[21401.42s -> 21407.34s]  all in all carl became a corrupt god driven by greed for chips and was soon dealt with after
[21407.34s -> 21417.62s]  being found we love you germa that sounds like a pretty fitting end why didn't you ask if the
