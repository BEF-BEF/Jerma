[0.95s -> 7.78s]  Hello, good afternoon. How are you doing? Are you doing good? Good. Peaceful Haley, thanks to the
[7.78s -> 14.52s]  six community subs right now. I'd like to welcome you away. You welcome, you can welcome me back.
[14.52s -> 24.79s]  I'll welcome you back at the same time. Ready? Welcome back. What are you guys saying shoo for?
[24.79s -> 29.75s]  Shoo, shoo. Right, right, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I can't fucking make a joke on Twitter.
[29.75s -> 38.15s]  Not allowed to make a joke on Twitter. That's what that was about. I mean, no, no, no, no, no.
[41.06s -> 49.32s]  Season premiere. I am not going to eat a shoo. Like, at this point, the shoo thing is,
[49.32s -> 56.04s]  that's like a channel joke at this point. That's a channel meme at this point. It doesn't, it doesn't
[56.04s -> 60.44s]  mean anything. It's, I'm not actually going to do that. If you think I'm actually going to do that,
[60.44s -> 68.33s]  then come on. You lied again. I didn't lie about anything. It's a, we make jokes on this comedy
[68.33s -> 80.84s]  stream. That's unfunny. Unfunny riot, right? We trusted you. Just what? Hold on. Comrad Castro,
[80.84s -> 89.96s]  thanks for the five. Community subs, appreciate it. You make a statement about fucking sans in
[89.96s -> 105.03s]  Smash Brothers. One day I'm going to unsub from you. Jeff, one day I'm going to unsub from you.
[106.52s -> 115.27s]  God damn it. Oh God. Can we please get over this? Guys, as a community, can we? All right, hold on.
[116.15s -> 126.94s]  Can we please? Can we get over this as a community, please? Why is it so big? Why,
[126.94s -> 137.90s]  I look professional right now. That shouldn't be happening. Nice hair. I can't get a haircut.
[139.59s -> 143.75s]  I was actually thinking about this. I was thinking about going and I was going to have Kim do this
[143.75s -> 157.98s]  for me. Oh shit, I moved that wrong way. Can we get over this shit though? Please? Yes, I'm still
[157.98s -> 165.10s]  in the old place, but I got news for you. Every place in Vegas, whether it's an apartment, a house
[165.10s -> 177.45s]  or a condo is the same house. They only make like three different places out here. When eventually
[177.45s -> 181.21s]  I'm in a new place, you're going to be like, oh shit, that looks, I'm not even going to tell
[181.21s -> 191.82s]  you when I move. You'll have to figure it out. Squeegee? Why are people saying squeegee? I know
[191.82s -> 197.64s]  there's a delay. There should be because we're about to play the Wii. We had a pre-stream chat
[197.64s -> 206.39s]  vote, but it shouldn't be delayed. Hold on. Let me do this. I mean, it's going to look, it's going
[206.39s -> 212.14s]  to look a little different for the first few minutes. It's delayed. You look sleepy? It's
[212.14s -> 220.71s]  because I am. It's because I am. I got like a fucking weird neck. It's an extreme delay. Shoo,
[220.71s -> 233.99s]  shoo, shoo. I, I, we gotta, I'm, I'm, get it off! Is that what you want? Can we get over this, please?
[234.71s -> 240.46s]  Can we get over this shit, please? If you think I'm going to eat this, you're out of your fucking
[240.46s -> 253.30s]  mind. Yeah, I'll take, can I take a bite and will you guys get over this? If I take a bite of this,
[253.30s -> 286.09s]  will you get over it? It's not as bad as I thought it was going to be. It tastes kind of like shit
[286.09s -> 299.00s]  though. Wait a minute. I'm not even stepping shit. Relax. It was a joke. Okay. I'll take,
[299.00s -> 316.47s]  should I take another bite of this shoe? This fucking shoe? I can't believe it. Eat the bottom.
[316.47s -> 321.27s]  I'm not going to eat the bottom of the shoe. I'm going to eat, I'm going to do, I'm going to do it
[321.27s -> 335.77s]  the way that I want to do it, not the way that you want me to do it. You can't eat a whole shoe
[335.77s -> 355.70s]  in five seconds. Holy shit, guys. Put it back on. I can't put it on. Not yet. I can't put it on.
[355.70s -> 366.25s]  Come on. I'm going to try over here. Wear the socks. It's fucking winter time. You don't wear
[366.25s -> 392.58s]  socks. Fucking Sans. It should never have been in the game. It's not even a Nintendo character.
[392.58s -> 396.74s]  If Sans is in Smash Brothers now, then Scrooge McDuck better be next week.
[401.54s -> 414.71s]  I don't need any more shoes for new characters. Strong teeth? No, these are special shoes.
[417.37s -> 427.62s]  No, my shoes are made out of fucking cotton. I have very dainty, I have very sensitive feet.
[428.34s -> 450.14s]  So they need to be put into these comfy shoes. This is gross. But you have to be a man of your
[450.14s -> 466.07s]  word. And I'm a man of my word. Should I put it back on? One more from the bottom?
[474.06s -> 498.01s]  He's a starving crack addict. No, I'm a man of my shoe eating word. Oh, it's not good. Oh,
[498.01s -> 504.62s]  sorry. Oh, I got some shoe residue on my hand. It's hot out. It's hot out here in Vegas. So
[504.78s -> 514.95s]  shoes melt. If you wear shoes made out of glycerin or whatever my shoes are made out of. I don't know.
[514.95s -> 527.78s]  The doctor does them. I don't. Oh shit actually says that. It doesn't. No, it doesn't. No, it
[528.82s -> 534.84s]  doesn't. No, it doesn't. No, it doesn't. No, it doesn't. Oh, excuse me. No, it doesn't.
[535.56s -> 544.46s]  No, it doesn't. That's, that's, that's water. I can't eat any more of this. This is
[544.46s -> 568.79s]  it eat the heel this is a shitty shoe i've told these were 600 dollars i don't know how you go

[1197.03s -> 1202.39s]  with an incredibly realistic totally a total reaction that makes perfect sense
[1202.39s -> 1211.06s]  well for the stupid fucking thing that i do on the stream sometimes let me see this is probably
[1211.06s -> 1221.03s]  going to be an actual reaction that like a normal person would probably have let's see so it looks
[1221.03s -> 1234.07s]  like deal or no deal isn't really working what the fuck is this who's this
[1251.16s -> 1253.74s]  all right i'm gonna switch it to whatever fucking game that is
[1260.70s -> 1265.24s]  why does he sound like that this month so it looks like dealer no
[1265.24s -> 1286.33s]  deal why do i sound like he's bright he's bright he's got plenty of points look all right
[1289.19s -> 1297.85s]  okay i just ate a shoe on camera if somebody finds this stream and they don't know what the
[1297.85s -> 1303.13s]  fucking the the oh that's a perfectly normal reaction to have you're probably going to show
[1303.13s -> 1309.77s]  me a clip tomorrow of somebody that found this stream today and there he is eating a fucking shoe
[1309.77s -> 1314.20s]  and like screaming okay well let's go to the next stream because i don't want to i'm not going to
[1314.20s -> 1324.82s]  be here for this one what do you want why is he doing this hey by the way we're going to play
[1324.82s -> 1339.59s]  the wii today share the shoe clip that all that does is benefit me you understand that just brings
[1339.59s -> 1350.76s]  me benefit maybe not maybe not socially maybe not socially and twitch tv sense and and and view sense
[1350.76s -> 1357.80s]  numbers of how many clicks of video has received yeah doesn't help me out in any situation where
[1357.80s -> 1367.26s]  i've got to you know meet some of these people at twitchcon and say hello big bits do we oh shit

[1484.46s -> 1489.42s]  over it a few times it's part of the reason why we're going to change the streams this is an
[1489.42s -> 1496.46s]  important stream you don't want to miss this one stay tuned don't go anywhere what what is wrong
[1496.46s -> 1500.54s]  with me what why am i like this what that person's right why is he acting like this i don't know what

[1618.57s -> 1621.69s]  when that's not what we do here i don't think that's necessarily accurate i don't think it's

[1667.10s -> 1672.30s]  you ready i have i have to give you i'm not going to say the thing i'm going to say just hey let's
[1672.30s -> 1678.54s]  talk about something i'm not going to say i have uh that's 10 subs from snobosis and 10 subs from
[1678.54s -> 1688.18s]  nondescript civilian thank you guys both of you thanks for the fucking 20 subs back to back well
[1688.18s -> 1693.54s]  i am back and we should be back to kind of normal here but what is what's normal what's this is the
[1693.54s -> 1698.82s]  new stream schedule is what's going to happen i've noticed over the last six months or so
[1698.82s -> 1702.18s]  because if you don't know let me let's go over let's let's just go over very quickly tldr
[1702.82s -> 1709.38s]  i have a issue with my rib cage in my spine i have some problem we don't know if it's
[1709.38s -> 1713.70s]  costochondritis if i have arthritis we don't exactly know what exactly what's causing it
[1713.70s -> 1720.14s]  but we do have an idea right i've noticed over the last couple weeks of not really streaming that
[1720.14s -> 1726.30s]  much right so i've been moving around kim and i have been packing boxes we've been moving and
[1727.58s -> 1732.78s]  i feel a little looser and we did some streams that were shorter that were like three or four
[1732.78s -> 1740.66s]  hours last week and the week before that and i'm a little looser and i think what i'm what i'm
[1740.66s -> 1746.58s]  coming to the conclusion of this is what i've had discussions with this very thing is how do you how
[1746.58s -> 1773.83s]  do you say this word sedentary sedentary sedentary sedentary sedentary sedentary right so
[1775.30s -> 1783.45s]  when i sit here sedentary for more than four five six plus hours it hurts a lot and i've noticed
[1783.45s -> 1789.29s]  that the shorter streams i'm it doesn't hurt as much and i'm i can it's it it's easier when
[1789.29s -> 1794.49s]  i move around i can stay moving i can stay mobile so here's what i've decided to do
[1798.18s -> 1803.03s]  right all right i'm streaming i forgot um here's what i've decided to do what's going to happen
[1803.03s -> 1813.64s]  here is instead of six to eight hour streams three or four days a week i'm going to pull it back to
[1813.64s -> 1822.46s]  like four to six hour streams four to five days a week so there's going to be short and then i've
[1822.46s -> 1827.34s]  said this before like hey i'm going to do shorter streams but more we're going to pull back times
[1827.34s -> 1834.07s]  and stream more often because doing like four to six hours in and then being able to get up and
[1834.07s -> 1840.89s]  move around and i it's i don't just sit still for a very long time it helps a lot and i've been
[1840.89s -> 1845.29s]  noticing a very very huge difference only because i haven't been streaming and i've and the streams
[1845.29s -> 1849.22s]  i've been doing have been short so i'm going to keep that up i'm going to see if it helps i'm
[1849.22s -> 1857.02s]  going to see if it works so yeah you can expect instead of like three seven to eight hour plus
[1857.02s -> 1863.42s]  streams you'll get like four or five like four to six hour streams starting now starting until i
[1863.42s -> 1869.11s]  decide i want to change it or do something else it was also the idea that it was also the idea
[1869.93s -> 1880.44s]  that i would stream potentially twice a day so instead of a four to six hour stream five days
[1880.44s -> 1886.89s]  a week maybe i do like two to three hours take like a 30 40 plus minute break and come back in
[1886.89s -> 1892.82s]  an hour get some food and come back and do like another two or three hours i just have to move
[1892.82s -> 1898.47s]  around i have to there's also the idea maybe get a standing desk but the reason why i don't want to
[1898.47s -> 1905.00s]  do two streams in a day is because i i like i burn up quickly i know that a lot of guys understand
[1905.00s -> 1909.80s]  you guys get that and a lot a lot of guys know that by now and so some of these streams were
[1909.80s -> 1916.73s]  very high energy and after like three four plus hours like it's like a um what's a good analogy
[1916.73s -> 1923.98s]  to describe like something that like lights up real quick and then it's gone so if i were to do
[1923.98s -> 1933.16s]  a funnel fireworks okay yeah um no but i don't want to say that that's like a cheesy analogy
[1933.16s -> 1940.17s]  i'm a firework oh no you're not oh you you eat potato chips on the fucking couch all day like
[1940.17s -> 1948.10s]  relax but if i stream like three or four hours and then i go take like a two hour break i might
[1948.10s -> 1958.49s]  just like lose all my energy and that'll be it your sneeze yeah it comes out real quick
[1958.49s -> 1968.06s]  and really strong and it's uh no but it's like and it feels like kind of good for a second

[7200.66s -> 7207.13s]  minute game oh yeah but so um go back to the spider now so resident evil 3 is not that great huh
[7214.92s -> 7228.92s]  i'm still gonna play it though i mean am i not gonna play it remember i can jump now when do
[7228.92s -> 7256.84s]  we find a human what the hell is this like a briar patch oh a regular lizard bees oh my god
[7259.21s -> 7268.07s]  what are those mites holy shit they just disintegrated that lizard try to avoid the
[7268.07s -> 7300.65s]  mites what am i doing get off me i could just like feel those on me can i jump over them
[7301.13s -> 7326.46s]  this is kind of a scary game kinda wait watch it they have they have a they have a pattern
[7326.46s -> 7336.04s]  we'll just avoid them jump over them i think i have to just i have to go through them underneath
[7336.04s -> 7345.77s]  them can i make it if i run now i think you just have to just get through them they'll just suck
[7345.77s -> 7373.53s]  your blood okay they're like a they're like a laser you just have to avoid herma has mites it's the
[7373.53s -> 7376.41s]  very opposite of a laser no i'm talking about like in a game where it's just like
[7377.05s -> 7380.81s]  rare rare to go through you have to run through before you get hit by the laser
[7382.09s -> 7403.75s]  figure maybe you can knock them down they're running away oh the mites the mites are going
[7403.75s -> 7416.15s]  after me fuck i get too many there's too many around me i gotta run away
[7424.04s -> 7441.35s]  uh one more why is my stream 720p um there's a few reasons for that uh
[7441.35s -> 7446.23s]  1080p actually uh in my opinion this is my opinion is i don't think it's worth streaming
[7447.27s -> 7453.43s]  because it takes a lot more bandwidth it takes a lot more resources and 1080p doesn't really even
[7453.43s -> 7460.95s]  look any good until about eight to ten thousand k up so twitch really only allows six thousand up
[7461.51s -> 7467.43s]  to pretty much anybody to stream to the platform so a 1080p stream at six thousand up i mean you're
[7467.75s -> 7473.59s]  talking about a 1080 footage really needs like 10 000 up like look good at least eight to ten
[7474.31s -> 7486.50s]  that's why i don't do it now you can do like eight some people do 900p like 870 880 i could
[7486.50s -> 7493.45s]  do that but i got a 1080 maybe in the future we'll see we'll see where's this other spider
[7493.45s -> 7503.03s]  that's apparently alive just talking yeah i'm talking bitrate like 4 000 up like bitrate like
[7503.03s -> 7515.35s]  a 6 000 bitrate where does this want me to go what just happened did i just like skip a major
[7515.35s -> 7522.12s]  part of the level oh it's these things it's the other spider i don't like the other like weird
[7522.12s -> 7529.35s]  spiders like the black widows yep i hate these look i know it's cool i know like yeah you got
[7529.35s -> 7559.72s]  a tattoo of a black widow i know like but no i don't like them i'm gonna die find the widow's
[7559.72s -> 7565.14s]  cathedral hold the b button to build up your venom and then swing the wiimote down to deliver
[7565.14s -> 7577.58s]  a venom pounce it's a dot oh okay that's fucking awesome that's so cool all right let me give me
[7577.58s -> 7587.19s]  these grubs it's the cathedral we gotta go find the cathedral they have organized religion
[7589.75s -> 7603.02s]  all right uh there's another grub over here okay this way and then
[7604.89s -> 7608.30s]  all right germa has a mick chicken tattoo and then that would be a pretty cool one
[7610.52s -> 7616.68s]  but i'm talking like in the wrapper like the the solid wrapper wrapped mick chicken sandwich
[7618.78s -> 7633.64s]  that sounds pretty good that would be cool running away i want to try the venom pounce on somebody
[7634.20s -> 7647.67s]  remember do you eat the wrapper shit you're bringing back some weird like memories when i
[7647.67s -> 7654.55s]  was younger what was the bubble gum that you chewed the wrapper i remember there was a gum
[7655.70s -> 7664.23s]  that like you people chewed with the wrapper on what was it i swear to god this was a thing
[7664.79s -> 7674.46s]  it was like i think i was lied to when i was a kid it was like oh yeah you eat it with the wrapper
[7674.46s -> 7678.38s]  on you chew it with the wrapper on and i would chew the gum with the wrapper on this one specific
[7678.38s -> 7685.18s]  brand for some reason there was a reason for it and i remember it was weird and it didn't it was
[7685.18s -> 7689.26s]  just like this doesn't feel right i shouldn't be doing it like this but i did it and i have to take
[7689.34s -> 7697.26s]  eventually you take the like mushed up wrapper out of your mouth why did i do that does anybody
[7697.26s -> 7706.49s]  anybody else do that any of you for any reason starburst no i'm not talking about unwrapping
[7706.49s -> 7710.81s]  i'm talking about in the wrapper it goes in your mouth and you chew it with the wrapper on and
[7710.81s -> 7719.77s]  like break the wrapper down with your teeth chewing it it was stride it was seriously it was trident
[7720.78s -> 7729.56s]  trident it was trident it was trident was it trident maybe it was trident oh i did it first
[7729.64s -> 7742.41s]  no you can't do it ban everybody that says it let him fight i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm
[7742.41s -> 7773.66s]  gonna poison one of them oh shit it's orange needed smog oh i can do that too dickhead oh
[7774.62s -> 7796.02s]  i missed i missed again oh it's okay he died it was a poison aim for smog oh snake what a
[7796.02s -> 7813.53s]  fucking callback what a callback creature nice and then it's ready grabs a snake like a uh i don't
[7813.53s -> 7821.74s]  know like a orangutan grabs a snake right and then like an eagle gets the orangutan and then oh you
[7821.74s -> 7851.16s]  guys know what i was trying to say do the walk all right that's a family guy joke look okay when
[7851.16s -> 7857.88s]  family guy has like 28 seasons of show and the whole point of family guy is they come up
[7857.88s -> 7866.12s]  with like 600 random references a an episode they're talking about 600 times 30 episodes a
[7866.12s -> 7875.56s]  season so and so 30 times 28 it's like there's like 25 million there's like this probably like
[7875.56s -> 7885.90s]  55 000 family guy references over the years oh wait we got we got a fog window here
[7895.86s -> 7910.25s]  freeze him nice all right back it up again poison nice this one was fucking pretty good
[7910.97s -> 7931.32s]  that was an instant kill eat the shoe you're not you're a little late oh never mind when
[7931.32s -> 7938.74s]  are we gonna get another muffled when we're gonna get another muffled like 60 000 dollar line from
[7938.82s -> 7940.02s]  billy bop Thornton that just goes
[7946.33s -> 7962.18s]  it's coming up soon why are there so many of these cell phone
[7968.30s -> 7981.13s]  wait that's that might not be synced up that's not going to be synced up because the delay
[7981.13s -> 7998.65s]  that's not going to be synced up correctly hey what was it oh oh oh oh i wanted to bring this
[7998.65s -> 8005.83s]  up on stream so i've got every service that you call right let me get away from the fucking
[8005.83s -> 8011.26s]  loud beep thing is there a reason why every time you call any service that's ever existed
[8011.82s -> 8017.74s]  the first thing that happens is the please listen carefully as our menu options have changed
[8019.21s -> 8025.61s]  it's like that for like seven to eight straight years why do they say that every time are they
[8025.61s -> 8032.46s]  so terrified that you're not going to listen to the fucking menu that well okay the menu has
[8032.46s -> 8036.06s]  options have changed i better listen now is that that's the tactic right that's the strategy
[8037.85s -> 8044.65s]  because if you call like for instance if i were to call uh like a utility company or like a cable
[8044.65s -> 8048.73s]  company or something it says that every fucking time and it's that same exact thing every fucking
[8048.73s -> 8057.30s]  the menu doesn't change it's just that every single time it's for old people right i used to
[8057.30s -> 8064.81s]  work telecom and we did that so you never changed your options that's a Seinfeld joke well guess
[8064.81s -> 8071.21s]  what like cox cable has had that since Seinfeld was on the air do you understand that's my point
[8071.21s -> 8091.42s]  it still works i could that's an epic kramer moment fuck i thought i could get a big one
[8091.98s -> 8102.06s]  and i was gonna make a tweet i didn't though because like i'm lazy and i don't fucking use
[8102.06s -> 8106.86s]  social media ever there's something wrong with me i was gonna make a tweet that was a phone and
[8106.86s -> 8112.30s]  you know like the oh name a better duo tweets right it was gonna be it's gonna be a phone picture
[8112.30s -> 8118.70s]  it says please listen carefully and then like another phone as our menu options have changed
[8118.70s -> 8124.01s]  and it's gonna be like college shit that's pretty good like comedy tweet like name a name and name me
[8124.01s -> 8134.92s]  it better do all right thank god you didn't do that why why what's wrong with that that's like
[8134.92s -> 8139.72s]  funny that's like name me oh name me i better do like please listen carefully as our menu options
[8139.72s -> 8148.94s]  have changed that would have been shared around like some circles right that was a new animal
[8148.94s -> 8156.78s]  that's boomer here i didn't i didn't do it i was just i you guys act like i did this i should do it
[8156.78s -> 8165.50s]  anyways my aunt would find that funny yeah i'm trying to work on some new demographics here
[8165.50s -> 8177.08s]  you know we we can we can only ride the like scare every new viewer away and have people open the
[8177.08s -> 8188.33s]  stream and go what's i hate this guy demographic for you know i gotta branch out to like aunts you
[8188.33s -> 8194.89s]  just split a phrase what yeah but it's namely a better duo because everyone knows what that is
[8194.89s -> 8200.33s]  and everyone's like gets it you get it your aunt does your aunt gets comedy your aunt is a
[8201.05s -> 8214.04s]  understands comedians what's just flew by the fucking screen did i not get that double strike
[8214.04s -> 8234.68s]  combos but i can do a move list what was that i don't know i'm not i'm not i'm not gonna i'm
[8234.68s -> 8240.26s]  not gonna go like flood some stream so because you guys are like fucking like pranking somebody
[8240.26s -> 8276.46s]  or something don't do that shit what i mean it's me what uh yeah yeah yeah you can't you can't be
[8276.46s -> 8280.22s]  doing all right no you can't you actually can't be doing that you can't like be streaming like
[8280.22s -> 8284.63s]  movies and shit and then like me naked uh so that stream is probably going to go away pretty
[8284.63s -> 8292.17s]  quickly um yeah that's probably not that's probably not going to last very long um it's probably i
[8292.17s -> 8306.74s]  would assume that's probably not going to last a whole lot longer uh okay so i have to say about
[8306.74s -> 8312.82s]  that i have nothing else to say besides uh streaming movies on twitch is not allowed unless you use
[8312.82s -> 8320.02s]  their feature the twitch plays sees watches together feature if you have it uh which that
[8320.02s -> 8339.45s]  stream does not have okay uh yeah let's go oh spikes how do i jump go around oh like the
[8339.45s -> 8347.74s]  crunching noises it's a nice added effect please listen carefully as our menu options have changed
[8347.74s -> 8362.42s]  maybe you better do oh like oh i was on the phone the other day and i heard that that's not even
[8362.42s -> 8368.42s]  realistic i don't don't fall bugs have like a terminal velocity of like 600 million miles per
[8368.42s -> 8374.90s]  hour or something like you can't if you drop like an ant like off a building it's like just lands
[8374.90s -> 8383.00s]  normally right isn't that isn't that accurate like they can't they literally can't like die if they
[8383.00s -> 8394.23s]  fall off like a high thing or something no that's true tarantulas do not they die from being oh
[8394.79s -> 8403.94s]  oh yeah today i learned tarantulas are not ants right okay good to know only a third of what you
[8403.94s -> 8426.28s]  said was accurate oh do i need to be accurate i got one of those he's so strong he hates links

[8782.22s -> 8786.22s]  urban legend that chewing it with the wrapper on enhanced the flavor crystals

[10241.98s -> 10251.96s]  so you tell me that that nature decided to make a hard counter for the tarantula it's kind of
[10251.96s -> 10303.69s]  strange yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah invade the nest it just fucked you missed a wink oh maybe i
[10303.69s -> 10310.65s]  should oh by the way what do i have that's valuable nothing they don't want me on that show what the
[10310.65s -> 10321.00s]  hell do they want me on that show for just ban the word wink yeah probably just do it
[10321.64s -> 10329.51s]  yeah he should probably do it like an hour or two chibi robo no gotcha force is more expensive
[10329.51s -> 10334.23s]  than chibi robo gotcha force is a lot more expensive than chibi robo which by the way
[10334.23s -> 10338.15s]  nobody trusts that by the way in the pre-stream chat we're trying to figure out what i would do
[10338.15s -> 10344.36s]  today and unanimously i think like only four people voted for it out of like five or six hundred votes
[10346.09s -> 10354.78s]  you didn't buy chibi robo oh i didn't i didn't you didn't i didn't buy chibi robo i don't own
[10354.78s -> 10377.78s]  chibi robo you don't own that game but um what the fuck is this then what's um what's in here
[10377.78s -> 10393.29s]  what is that interesting it looks like uh this looks like a gamecube disc and it's it says chibi
[10393.29s -> 10413.19s]  robo on it i don't own this stuff i don't own that game all right whatever you get it you get it
[10413.19s -> 10423.27s]  things fucking things pretty valuable i've got did it well it's a fake i faked you out i'm not
[10423.27s -> 10432.42s]  gonna do that with chibi robo i just kind of did no i didn't i would never throw it be serious
[10432.42s -> 10441.35s]  that's a commodity we rented it for a blockbuster that probably wouldn't even available on that
[10441.35s -> 10449.72s]  blockbuster gotcha force is expensive gotcha force is really hard to find with a box and original
[10449.72s -> 10455.90s]  manual that shit's like three or four hundred dollars if you just get the disc gotcha force
[10455.90s -> 10463.19s]  that shit's like uh it's not it's not cheap and it's just the dumb disc not even the fucking
[10463.19s -> 10469.51s]  manual i sold mine for four hundred dollars last year well you made some you made bank
[10469.51s -> 10475.34s]  that game's worth a lot of money that might be the most besides cubivore cubivore and gotcha force
[10475.34s -> 10481.34s]  are the two i think most expensive games you can find on the game somebody's gonna be like actually
[10481.98s -> 10491.70s]  i know i know which one it's like cubivore is like 600 bucks cubivore is like five or
[10491.70s -> 10505.08s]  six hundred dollars that's a lot of fucking money for a game cube game here we go wait somebody say
[10505.08s -> 10509.96s]  six hundred dollars is not a lot of money for a game cube game what do you consider a lot of money
[10519.32s -> 10539.16s]  got it oh he's dizzy he's dizzy dizzy dizzy break his neck again is it i wish you would stop
[10539.16s -> 10571.72s]  pretending to own chibi robo bad angle bad angle like the bad angle got it ah i dodged trying to
[10571.72s -> 10611.13s]  go that way you fucking idiot one more was that it who proved you own chibi robo put it in the
[10611.13s -> 10616.20s]  wheat i'm in the middle of something right now if you can't i'm not sure you can tell but i'm in the
[10616.20s -> 10630.46s]  middle of something go inside the eye show the receipt sure okay guys yeah what what do you know
[10630.46s -> 10648.12s]  i'm not gonna give you that i'm up i'm on this ceiling he doesn't have it when you guys drunk
[10648.76s -> 10677.30s]  only you your credit card security number to tell me you know there's there was this idea that i had
[10677.30s -> 10682.34s]  you guys remember the like the christmas stream right where i was like hey i'm gonna give you guys
[10682.34s -> 10687.30s]  like 500 bucks to just buy random shit and i'll just cover it whatever like i'll just pay for it
[10687.30s -> 10693.02s]  right yeah there was this like theory that it was like i don't think i could have ever done it
[10693.98s -> 10700.47s]  where you guys like have to use like i would just it would be terrible and i it wouldn't
[10700.47s -> 10704.23s]  work out at all and the idea got thrown in the trash can immediately when it popped in my head
[10704.95s -> 10711.96s]  but like if i bought like a fucking visa gift card and just like showed it and just like see
[10711.96s -> 10722.92s]  what somebody bought but that's a bit that's a fucking that's not gonna work out like it's
[10722.92s -> 10730.89s]  not gonna work out like what would happen what would actually happen you know what i mean have
[10730.89s -> 10736.66s]  like the statement over here on one monitor and be like one two three there's a number and just
[10736.66s -> 10744.04s]  like capture the window of the statement and refresh it every five seconds and then i think
[10744.04s -> 10748.60s]  okay that's like that's like that that would never work because people would just buy a bunch of
[10748.60s -> 10767.22s]  fucked up shit and it would come leading back to me so no what was that for um can i am i gonna
[10767.22s -> 10799.03s]  move this rock oh damn all right let's go frog no i thought it was a frog i got excited boros

[12805.69s -> 12830.86s]  you beat him all right this is like a big long corridor climb up there right there
[12833.51s -> 12847.75s]  then it was the next one right there oh i'm upside down no what what's happened
[12849.53s -> 12862.90s]  did i really just fall on my back i'm flat on my back how far away was that
[12863.46s -> 12901.70s]  who wwe network stream oh that's pretty far watch wwe no i'm not gonna watch wwe right out
[12901.70s -> 12910.73s]  i'm trying to play the spider game end of the stream voice uh not quite coming up here soon
[12910.73s -> 12929.11s]  though not quite not quite did i like ray mysterio ray mysterio was fucking awesome
[12929.19s -> 12941.30s]  all right i'm gonna go over here when is hulk uh so because of the coronavirus amazon is not
[12941.30s -> 12948.39s]  shipping a lot of stuff or it's where it's delayed like prime two-day shipping doesn't really exist
[12949.77s -> 12955.30s]  so it's kind of just it kind of just coming it's going to come when it comes it's going to get
[12955.30s -> 12960.26s]  here when it gets it will get it when it gets here you said you would buy it a month ago i know
[12961.14s -> 12970.74s]  and i know he's lying no i'm not go to go to hulk ultimate destruction on the game cube right now
[12970.74s -> 12978.95s]  on amazon and find one and the shipping dates are within like the next couple weeks things are coming
[12978.95s -> 12985.98s]  faster than you think it's just giving out a date just in case well okay there we go i don't lie
[12985.98s -> 12994.36s]  about everything guys just the most stuff 30 webcams yeah that's also impossible too because
[12995.00s -> 12999.32s]  also due to the coronavirus webcams are in very short supply right now
[13000.47s -> 13010.63s]  and so they were either completely out of stock or they're two hundred dollars for one that's
[13010.63s -> 13022.89s]  also another unfortunate thing why is the game why is this game 77 dollars why is the game 77
[13022.89s -> 13030.54s]  wait why is what do you mean microphones too yeah but it makes sense though it makes sense because
[13031.50s -> 13038.46s]  tons of people are working from home and conferencing from home and people are communicating
[13038.46s -> 13043.34s]  over you know the social distancing so it makes sense as to why the webcams wouldn't be really
[13044.14s -> 13053.05s]  um something that's very very readily available right now uh but yeah we just we have to figure
[13053.05s -> 13059.50s]  that out whenever those come back into stock maybe we can see how things are and get them done all
[13059.50s -> 13062.38s]  right i gotta okay i'm like upside down let me see what the hell i'm doing
[13063.18s -> 13070.41s]  play visceral let me just let me just get through this part first
[13071.45s -> 13075.77s]  okay so i think i've done like every level in district cleanup haven't i
[13082.38s -> 13085.82s]  no play house flipper well when they add something new i'll play it
[13087.10s -> 13099.61s]  house flipper has been the same game since garden flipper i played that they did when what do they
[13099.61s -> 13108.18s]  add what is it what is it they added space wait are we talking about this for cleanup we're talking
[13108.18s -> 13127.93s]  about house flipper let's see anything i'm going right away house both all right we saw this we
[13127.93s -> 13148.98s]  can't skip it though you got the map these guys what's this like any sense what are these squiggly
[13148.98s -> 13155.30s]  things all over all right somebody's watching another movie on twitch with my likeness on it
[13155.30s -> 13166.65s]  grab the shovels explain the plot you're a fucking mean bug see i didn't even do that he did that on

[14901.85s -> 14910.38s]  i'm staying loose the looser that i stay the better that i feel that's kind of the reasoning
[14910.38s -> 14917.18s]  for pulling streams back but adding stream days so i can stream essentially the same amount of time
[14917.18s -> 14923.80s]  but spread out for less time per stream because i can stay loose easier that way that's the idea
[14924.52s -> 14933.38s]  see if it works uh but thank you jzzb for the thousand bits sorry you had to eat that shoe
[14933.38s -> 14940.78s]  it was probably really gross and sugary isn't that bad it actually was pretty good i didn't

[14984.09s -> 14990.73s]  because eating the shoe in the very beginning was like oh whoa we're going to fucking a million

[16491.86s -> 16496.26s]  when i was in summer camp in 2010 i felt something crawling on my face in the middle of the night
[16496.26s -> 16502.26s]  i picked it up and tossed it over the bunk i still don't know what it was well the terrifying thing
[16502.26s -> 16507.78s]  about what you're saying here is it was big enough for you to grab with your hand if it was big
[16507.78s -> 16525.70s]  enough for you to hold in your hand and throw that's terrifying i think everyone's had a scenario
[16525.70s -> 16529.38s]  like that play out potentially in their life where you just don't know what it was and it
[16529.38s -> 16535.70s]  could be anything and then you just never know and never knowing is awful because what the hell was
[16535.70s -> 16545.03s]  it and what could it could it be possible that that could happen again it actually happens not
[16545.83s -> 16549.27s]  super frequently but not infrequently enough where you don't realize it's happening
[16549.91s -> 16553.59s]  how many times do you feel just something like touch your arm or like your leg or something when
[16553.59s -> 16558.95s]  you're lying down in bed and it's just like rip toss throw as fucking hard as i can in that
[16558.95s -> 16566.28s]  in left direction and you just have no idea and you'll never know it could have been a piece of
[16566.28s -> 16579.82s]  hair and you'll never know an anonymous cheerer thanks for five dollars 500 bits just 500 bits
[16579.82s -> 16584.70s]  dropping him right here thank you reaper thanks for 250 hey since the rumble is until september
[16584.70s -> 16589.82s]  because of covet 19 can we maybe get a sneak peek event advertising the rumble it's been too
[16589.82s -> 16606.38s]  long since we've seen our friends from the ring um yeah yeah the plan is this is the plan the rumble
[16608.09s -> 16616.30s]  and a few matches will happen in september before the marathon but probably gonna do
[16616.38s -> 16632.81s]  do a small card of kind of a pre matches with no rumble so instead of having the the big main event
[16632.81s -> 16639.08s]  being the 30 person rumble and it's like an hour we'll just do some matches with some new characters
[16639.90s -> 16644.86s]  and the rumble will be in september so maybe like a few weeks leading up to the the rumble
[16644.86s -> 16651.66s]  we'll do that or maybe we won't and maybe i'll just save everything and just have a huge event
[16651.66s -> 16657.51s]  because that rumble is going to be for charity that's going to be a charity stream those that
[16657.51s -> 16664.79s]  don't know all the money that's going to come through that stream is going to be directly
[16665.67s -> 16675.00s]  given to charity there's going to be a direct link it'll be tracked it'll be easy we'll have all that
[16675.00s -> 16682.76s]  set up so it's just completely just transparent and there it is and it open so it might be better
[16682.76s -> 16687.56s]  to have it all be one big you know three four five hour event rather than one small one that
[16687.56s -> 16704.58s]  would be much better i think we'll see but that's the plan still scheduled for september not sure
[16704.58s -> 16709.77s]  we want to do before it hey demonic cucumber thanks for 250 i haven't given any bits in a
[16709.77s -> 16714.17s]  while because i've missed a lot of streams from my new sleep schedule i didn't really know what to

[16876.63s -> 16883.45s]  have your feelings changed do you have an update for us i was looking around for something that
[16883.45s -> 16889.13s]  would be something i really want to take care of and but the move has been a lot more complicated
[16889.93s -> 16897.05s]  because of all the coronavirus stuff so it hasn't really been a simple process to kind of move and
[16897.05s -> 16903.45s]  get everything done and situated and that's it um so that's kind of been put on the back burner
[16903.45s -> 16912.68s]  for a while until things sort of settle down and decide if that's something that i actually
[16912.68s -> 16923.86s]  really want to do i do though what was that pinball that was uh odama odama dobski dude
