[0.31s -> 14.07s]  Let's go. Morning, Dread. Glad you could make it for reorientation.
[14.07s -> 27.54s]  I didn't expect that to work. This is your health meter showing how much health you have.
[27.54s -> 31.85s]  If it drops to zero, you will die. Oh, that's what a health meter is.
[31.85s -> 40.20s]  It will protect you from occasional hits, but it cannot stand. Watch it. Watch it.
[41.20s -> 46.20s]  Mission failed. They got fed up. They couldn't take it anymore.
[46.20s -> 50.20s]  They couldn't take my face punching anymore. And now the whole team is...
[54.91s -> 58.11s]  Dispense some justice.
[58.11s -> 66.54s]  Got a protest out here. Ladies and gentlemen, if you could please refrain from protesting this close to the city gates.
[66.54s -> 70.98s]  I'd appreciate it. You know what? Just, you're under arrest.
[70.98s -> 79.15s]  Put the signs down. Put the sign down. Everybody chill out. You're all under arrest.
[81.15s -> 88.15s]  Ten years for protesting? That sucks. Ten years for protesting.
[96.25s -> 99.25s]  Why is he going away for life? Why is he...
[100.25s -> 109.25s]  Dude, this guy's going away for life. He did the exact same crime as everybody else and he's going away for his life.
[111.25s -> 115.79s]  Holy shit.
[117.79s -> 122.22s]  Look at this lady. Oh my god.
[124.22s -> 128.22s]  She even has a thing on her back that says, oh yeah, oh yeah.
[128.22s -> 133.78s]  You see, I wasn't even going to make that joke. This game made that joke for me.
[133.78s -> 139.02s]  This is a female beer. It is. It even says it on her fucking shirt.
[142.16s -> 144.85s]  What am I arresting her for?
[145.85s -> 147.85s]  Three months for what?
[149.85s -> 158.05s]  Bank robbery. I'm on it. Bank robbery. Oh, bank robbery.
[158.05s -> 164.79s]  Toss another grenade. Got him. Get down.
[164.79s -> 168.50s]  Can't see anything right now.
[170.51s -> 176.88s]  This is worse than TF2. How long am I on fire for? That sucked.
[176.88s -> 185.90s]  Anybody else? I got one of you guys. I'm out of bullets.
[185.90s -> 196.28s]  I probably shouldn't be killing everybody right now, but you know what? They're shooting at us. They're shooting at officers.
[196.28s -> 206.87s]  What are we supposed to do? What happened to you? Is that a judge?
[206.87s -> 209.87s]  That is a judge. Don't spread it to me, dude.
[209.87s -> 215.35s]  Somebody help him. I feel like I need to help him.
[215.35s -> 220.92s]  Is there anything I can do to help you? I don't think so.
[220.92s -> 224.10s]  I'm pretty sure you're just on fire forever.
[224.10s -> 227.59s]  That's got to be a terrible, terrible way to go.
[227.59s -> 233.86s]  Move. You're going to have to move, dude. I can't arrest this guy if you're circling him.
[233.86s -> 235.86s]  Look what you did.
[238.42s -> 242.42s]  Dude, that had to be done. That had to be done, and you all know it.
[242.42s -> 249.14s]  Get out of my town.
[249.14s -> 253.02s]  Oh, does your buddy want to follow me around? Does your buddy want to follow me?
[253.02s -> 256.02s]  Is that what he wants to do? Not anymore.
[256.02s -> 261.62s]  Why are the people still out? The vampires are everywhere.
[261.62s -> 269.79s]  You think they'd be like an emergency bulletin. They're just running around killing everybody.
[269.79s -> 274.44s]  They're just running around killing every single citizen.
[274.44s -> 280.24s]  Okay. Okay.
[280.24s -> 287.02s]  You know, you could run. That's an option, you know.
[288.32s -> 292.32s]  Citizens of Judged Red City number five, you could run.
[292.32s -> 300.73s]  Break out. You can't handle that.
[300.73s -> 303.54s]  You guys could not handle that.
[303.54s -> 307.54s]  All you had to do was shoot. You guys went through the same training that I went through.
[307.54s -> 310.54s]  And you can't shoot a zombie at point blank range.
[310.54s -> 314.17s]  I can't even. I don't even want to look at you two.
[314.17s -> 319.72s]  You know we can.
[319.72s -> 323.94s]  Could use a little bit of help here.
[323.94s -> 325.94s]  Come on, people.
[325.94s -> 328.63s]  Again. Again.
[328.63s -> 335.53s]  Mr. Medical Man.
[335.53s -> 338.34s]  How is he the only one to get out of that?
[338.34s -> 340.34s]  This guy is the only person to get out.
[340.34s -> 343.34s]  And he literally has no weapons and he's been walking.
[343.34s -> 350.32s]  Oh my goodness.
[350.32s -> 361.74s]  I got too many bullets ricocheting.
[361.74s -> 367.18s]  What the fuck? That guy wasn't dead?
[367.18s -> 370.55s]  What? Oh, dude.
[370.55s -> 375.06s]  Dude, you know what just happened right there?
[375.06s -> 379.26s]  He just got a bullet ricocheted in his head.
[379.26s -> 386.30s]  That was awesome.
[386.30s -> 389.30s]  Wait, do I just have to survive during like a gang war?
[389.30s -> 396.46s]  Why are you shooting me?
[396.46s -> 398.46s]  You're supposed to be... There's a suspect in there.
[398.46s -> 400.46s]  What the... See what the fuck you did?
[400.46s -> 402.46s]  You turned and you shot me.
[402.46s -> 404.46s]  And it ended up getting you killed.
[404.46s -> 406.46s]  Like, what were you doing?
[406.46s -> 408.90s]  Holy shit, dude.
[408.90s -> 411.65s]  You need to get your glasses examined.
[411.65s -> 417.49s]  It's still blinking mission failed and I can still move around.
[417.49s -> 421.44s]  You get down.
[421.44s -> 425.54s]  Oh, it's another judge.
[425.54s -> 427.54s]  I went rogue.
[427.54s -> 429.90s]  I went rogue.
[429.90s -> 431.90s]  I went rogue.
