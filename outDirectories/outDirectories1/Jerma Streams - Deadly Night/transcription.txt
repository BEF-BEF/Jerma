[5.43s -> 17.85s]  Okay, I'm back. It's time to switch to a scary game. It is October. We played Scorn
[18.89s -> 39.02s]  a few days ago. What should I title this? It's Deadly Night. What do I title this? How about um...
[41.83s -> 64.71s]  Look Out. Watch Out. Uh, I don't know. You want me to title the name of my stream? Play Scorn.
[64.71s -> 79.80s]  I'm not gonna do that. Um, I believe I just turned on my Xbox. I may have. I'm not sure yet.
[79.80s -> 90.46s]  Doesn't look like it, but I could have. All right. Uh, Halloween Approaches. Ghost.
[102.57s -> 112.66s]  I don't know. How about just like, You Scared. Yeah, You Scared. You're safe. You're safe in the
[112.66s -> 134.82s]  comments. Yeah. The smiley face. You're safe in the comments. You don't remember that? That's not-
[134.82s -> 160.12s]  You don't like that one? I'm keeping it. All right. Let's go. Oh, lights off. You're right. Hold on.
[160.12s -> 188.25s]  Nobody even said it. I just did though. This is not Vampire Survivors. Yeah. Lights off. Creepy.
[188.25s -> 201.51s]  Sorry I'm like stalling really bad, but it's a scary game and I fucking hate these. You know me.
[201.51s -> 216.73s]  I know. I hate these. I hate it. I hate these games. I don't know why I just screamed. It's way too
[216.73s -> 261.93s]  bright. This is kind of scary. All right. I like this. This is scary. What do you think? Also,
[261.93s -> 272.58s]  let me know. Let me know if it's- if this shit's still happening. Webcam glitching. Because it
[272.58s -> 285.69s]  really shouldn't be. How's that? Are we good? Does it look- does it look scary? I think that looks
[285.69s -> 308.15s]  all right. Very spooky. Good? Maybe a little bit more bright? Just a little bit? I think that's
[308.15s -> 314.23s]  good. Yeah, this is perfect. All right. I'm ready. Lights off. Deadly night. No more stalling. It's
[314.23s -> 329.86s]  time to fucking go. I'm ready. This game contains nudity. Uh, did I? I don't know. I want to censor
[329.86s -> 337.00s]  the nudity. I mean, it's asking me if I want to censor it. Is it TOS? Anybody played this yet?
[337.00s -> 354.12s]  Other people have played with it on? Okay. It's part of the game. Other people have played with
[354.12s -> 363.96s]  it on. Uh, I mean, is it- how- is it really- means- okay, honest to god, let me just tell you.
[364.68s -> 373.58s]  If- if I could show scorn, the- if I could show scorn, I- I don't think- I think it's- I don't
[373.58s -> 383.91s]  know. I think it's gonna be okay. Motel? The house? Susan 9-1-1 call. I don't know. Is it like- is
[383.91s -> 387.67s]  sent- is it like- like a big black bar? Is it gonna take me out of the game? I don't know what
[387.67s -> 414.01s]  it- what that means, but whatever. Jesus Christ, dude. What the fuck? Where are you going?
[414.01s -> 414.57s]  Where am I going?
[448.07s -> 459.27s]  Are you sure I look good?
[471.88s -> 483.86s]  Where are we going? Is this gonna be loud?
[494.01s -> 499.00s]  Is this game- is this game scary? Tell me the truth.
[527.77s -> 545.32s]  You're welcome. Okay. Okay, whatever. Okay, I've got run inventory. Pause. Crouch flashlight.
[545.32s -> 559.62s]  Look around. No, we're not doing gamepad. All right, so there we go. I have an inventory.
[559.62s -> 574.82s]  Is it me? Stop. My- I'm so- I'm so jumpy right now, too. I don't know why. I don't want any
[574.82s -> 594.31s]  drinks. Motel. Highway. Motel. Single room $20, double room $40. It is mandatory to pay in advance
[594.31s -> 599.19s]  and leave the room before $12. If you do not have phones in the rooms, the only phone available is
[599.19s -> 606.55s]  at the reception. Talk to the person in charge for more info. Like, grenades? Why do you have
[606.55s -> 636.22s]  a bunch of grenades? My cam's not on the edge of the screen. Oops. Okay, so, um, I guess I can't
[636.22s -> 644.15s]  do anything in here. I can't play this tonight. I actually don't think I can. I'm so fucked up
[644.15s -> 646.79s]  today. You know what I mean? I'm super, like, hmm.
[661.82s -> 671.56s]  I see. The bus usually arrives at 8 a.m. I can let you know an hour earlier if you wish.
[673.78s -> 687.30s]  Um, sure. It would be perfect, thanks. Are you coming with someone? I'm alone, but I want a
[687.30s -> 702.71s]  double room. Many people come here to have sex. Is it your case? What the fuck do you care?
[702.71s -> 714.68s]  I care. I'm sure you're great at wiggling that ass, right? Do you like sex from the front,
[714.68s -> 732.06s]  back, or both? I will not say here. Fuck you. Yeah, I'm sorry. Fuck you. Who the fuck is this guy?
[745.22s -> 765.18s]  Crash. It stinks. It seemed to be pretty dirty. Door number one, door number two.
[765.98s -> 792.58s]  Do I have to, wait, do I have to get a room? I, okay. I think I have to just demand a room.
[792.58s -> 804.44s]  I think we're, we need game progress here. While you're playing this and not stay out of the house,
[804.44s -> 811.06s]  I will be playing stay out of the house. Just not right this very moment. I will. It's on the list
[811.06s -> 817.05s]  of games to play in the next week or two. I guess I have to get a room or something. I have to get
[817.05s -> 828.90s]  a room. I can't just, all right, well. Have you had second? A young girl like you shouldn't be out
[828.90s -> 843.88s]  there alone at this hour. Okay. Give me the fucking room. Give me a room. What door is this?
[844.52s -> 869.30s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, number eight. Are you lost? School. All right. Eight was
[869.30s -> 899.51s]  right. Okay. Use. Turn the light on quick. I need to lock the door, right? Like where's the door lock?
[899.51s -> 927.61s]  That's scary. Is this a bathroom? Yeah, turn every light on so all the spirits can't get in here.
[930.36s -> 965.96s]  Oh my God. I hate this. Yeah. Why is it automatically put on like a horror channel?
[965.96s -> 1007.18s]  Uh, okay. What kind of TV channel is this? Let's, can we break this down for one second?
[1007.18s -> 1016.84s]  This is a scary sound effect channel. It's just creepy noises, scary music.
[1025.46s -> 1030.02s]  What is this? Why is this on TV? I'm not putting that on. All right. I'm sleeping with all the
[1030.02s -> 1051.29s]  lights on. Every single light is being turned on. Uh, oh, the door is stuck.
[1052.25s -> 1057.61s]  Water. Water from the sink. Water. Smash the window. Glass is too hot. Uh, break something.
[1057.61s -> 1081.85s]  Hit something. Um, TV. Door's stuck. Go, go, go, go, go. What the? What does that say?
[1082.65s -> 1089.83s]  My God. That's a nightmare. I'm gonna scream in my face. We're gonna get ready for a scream in my
[1089.83s -> 1119.03s]  mouth. That nightmare. Right now I don't need the backpack. I can hear a noise in the room. I should
[1119.03s -> 1228.25s]  see what it is. What is this noise? Today's August 17, 1987. What does it say? 911, what is your
[1228.25s -> 1234.25s]  emergency? I'm at the highway motel. The owner is a sicko. I've discovered hidden cameras behind the
[1234.25s -> 1241.88s]  mirrors in my room. They were recording. Don't worry. I'll send a patrol car. The area is quite
[1241.88s -> 1301.34s]  remote and it will take some time to get there. So please be patient. Okay. Um, okay. Okay. All
[1301.34s -> 1311.40s]  right. Backspace. Backspace. I don't want. How do I get out of this TV? Does he make porn movies
[1311.40s -> 1317.48s]  by filming? I also appear in the recording. I heard the door open. Hey, what are you doing here?
[1320.14s -> 1325.90s]  I have discovered your secrets. You sick. I've already called the police and they're on their
[1325.90s -> 1335.10s]  way. You're going to end up behind bars. Oh, the police. I don't think so. You're going to stay
[1335.10s -> 1345.02s]  locked in here until I decide what to do with you. And maybe I'll fuck that sweet hairy pussy.
[1348.90s -> 1354.73s]  What the fuck? Just trashed the TV on his head. It's Matt. I got to fucking hit with the TV.
[1358.41s -> 1366.23s]  I have to fucking kill this guy. What the fuck? What is laughing? Oh, it's this.
[1366.79s -> 1395.64s]  If only I had a coin. Do I have a coin? This is fucked. Do I have a coin? I don't have a coin.
[1402.60s -> 1433.66s]  Okay. Go back to the room and get my backpack. Oh, come on. You know, I didn't have anything
[1433.66s -> 1448.73s]  important. I can. Was this car here before? Was this car here before? Was this actually here before?
[1448.73s -> 1485.80s]  I don't think it was. I'm staying right in the middle. A car comes. I, it won't hit me. I mean,
[1485.80s -> 1495.14s]  right in the center. They're going to pull some bullshit with it. A cop car is going to be flying
[1495.14s -> 1506.41s]  down here. No, I'm going over here. Why is that music? How come I touch that music starts? Oh my
[1506.41s -> 1548.47s]  God. You're going to reverse. Oh God. Oh, I heard something. I'm going back. I'm going back. I'm
[1548.47s -> 1566.94s]  going back. I'm going back. I'm going. I'm going back. I'm going back to the hotel. Get off the
[1566.94s -> 1585.53s]  road. Should I go back to the motel? I'm going to go back and get the backpack because he's driving
[1585.53s -> 1603.37s]  that way and he has not turned around yet. He hasn't turned around yet. It's invisible. Well,
[1603.37s -> 1622.07s]  I can't. Is he still just parked in the middle of the street? Honestly, I'm going here and like
[1622.07s -> 1674.57s]  get down in like the weeds and shit. Oh God damn it. Shit. God damn it. If I keep my eye on him,
[1675.21s -> 1711.99s]  then he can't get me. What happened? Why did you stop? Why did you stop? Why did you stop the car?
[1711.99s -> 1792.87s]  Why did you stop the car? Can you beat it? Can you beat this? Like, can you win? The murderer's
[1792.87s -> 1853.03s]  house. Oh, oh, there are four acts. Okay. I hate this. Okay. I got up. Oh God. What is this? Turn
[1853.03s -> 1880.68s]  it on. Turn it on. Oh, how do I use it? No, no. Where the fuck is this? I have to get out of here.
[1882.50s -> 1899.32s]  Oh my God. Can't turn it. I don't know the combination. All right. I need to know the
[1899.32s -> 1929.37s]  combination. Can I hide in this? There's so many places to go. You can hide under tables,
[1929.37s -> 1944.87s]  beds, and in some furniture. I got to practice that. How do you do that? Crouch. I can crouch.
[1944.87s -> 1978.76s]  This door is locked. How can I get out? There's nothing to hide under.
[1998.31s -> 2010.47s]  I'm alive. I'm alive. Spider. Oh my God, dude. Where do I even go? What do I do?
[2018.07s -> 2062.41s]  No, no, no, dude. I don't know where to go. How do I? Home? Rust remover. I can't reach it. There's
[2062.41s -> 2085.75s]  something in there. Dude, how do you hide? How do I hide? Oh, wait. Where the fuck am I? Am I? Where am
[2085.75s -> 2129.54s]  I? Am I hiding? Where am I? I want to play the Batman game again. I want to ride around and
[2129.54s -> 2145.10s]  protect Gotham City. He's right out here and I'm gonna, I'm gonna walk right into him when I get
[2145.10s -> 2158.98s]  out of here and I have like one slash and I'm dead. Where is he going? Okay, this is, somebody make
[2158.98s -> 2175.13s]  this into a poster for a horror movie. Honest to God, somebody needs to turn this into a poster.
[2175.13s -> 2184.90s]  Like, with the title, like, you're not getting out or something, right? What is the title of
[2184.90s -> 2209.22s]  this movie, do you think? You tell me. My eyes are all red. Why do I look so fucked up? Holy shit,
[2209.22s -> 2241.45s]  man. This is fucked. I look like Voldemort. Oh, this is a screen cap from Dumb and Dumber.
[2244.50s -> 2274.87s]  I hope people AI expand that one. I hope so too. He's right. He won't leave. Just leave me alone.
[2274.87s -> 2313.40s]  Rust remover. Yeah, you can see through that knob doesn't turn. Maybe I can use something to make us
[2313.40s -> 2349.69s]  make the psycho pull it down. Bandage. How do I use this? How do I use the bandage? Is there a save?
[2349.69s -> 2369.26s]  Hide in the box and shimmy out. That actually could probably work. I hate this game. I hate
[2369.26s -> 2405.24s]  this. Right here. Okay, so I have rust remover. Something was rusty. Sink was rusty. Sink was
[2405.24s -> 2415.98s]  rusty. You know what? Scared. That's what you want. I'm gonna march out here and just start singing
[2415.98s -> 2426.18s]  fucking John Jingleheimer Schmidt. What are you doing? No, you're supposed to be scared.
[2426.18s -> 2433.98s]  John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt. His name is my name too. Whenever we go out,
[2434.94s -> 2466.86s]  we always shout. Here comes John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt. Get in the bathtub quick.
[2466.86s -> 2475.72s]  John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt. His name is my name too. Whenever I go out,
[2475.72s -> 2479.08s]  the people always shout. Here comes John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt.
[2480.04s -> 2497.66s]  Where is he? Dude, I can't see anything. Break this door. Break this door. Break this door,
[2497.66s -> 2508.76s]  dude. This game is fucked. This game is fucked up. That's wicked funny. We got to see this one.
[2508.76s -> 2525.18s]  This one's perfect. I don't want to play this. I hate this. This is a good one though. Wait,
[2525.18s -> 2546.97s]  come on, come on, come on. Why can I not save this? This one is so good. This is fucking actually
[2546.97s -> 2557.75s]  one of the funniest things I've ever seen. I have to get these on stream. I have to. Okay,
[2557.75s -> 2568.73s]  well, everyone bear with me for a second. I got to get these all loaded because these are gold.
[2568.73s -> 2578.94s]  These are actual gold. Here's the first one. This one's pretty good, I will say. This one's
[2578.94s -> 2593.34s]  pretty good. They get better. They get way better. And I mean, way better. This one,
[2593.42s -> 2599.30s]  um, apparently, so an AI decided that this is what I was doing. Okay, makes sense, right?
[2599.30s -> 2624.33s]  Why would I be this concerned? Here's the next one. I, dinner, I'm making dinner and I'm very,
[2625.05s -> 2639.59s]  this is an oven that I'm shocked at. But wait, it's not even the best one because the best one
[2639.59s -> 2644.47s]  is right here. And it could be the funniest image I've seen ever on the channel. And I mean that.
[2644.47s -> 2648.14s]  This is probably the funniest thing. This is probably the funniest image that's come through.
[2648.14s -> 2676.55s]  This is so good. Look at how bad that form is too. It's so bad. This is like the old guy.
[2677.94s -> 2706.06s]  This kind of has to like stay. Okay, retry. How far am I in the game? Not even fucking close,
[2706.06s -> 2713.93s]  dude. I don't think I'm going to beat this. Close the door. Close the door. Close the door.
[2713.93s -> 2729.02s]  I can't close it. Is it open? I don't think I'm going to be able to do this. I don't think I can
[2729.02s -> 2749.80s]  play this game. Trying to commit this house to memory and he's wicked fast. I need to get items
[2749.80s -> 2761.08s]  and shit. No way. I'm not going to be able to beat this. I'm going to panic every time he shows
[2761.08s -> 2776.10s]  up. Was there an item down here? No, it's back up in the house. All right. This is a good one,
[2776.10s -> 2783.08s]  too. I'm going to show this one. This is also a really good one. I kind of just want to like
[2783.08s -> 2790.23s]  do this for the rest of the stream. This is fun. Apparently like very, very, very excited at the
[2790.23s -> 2804.76s]  birthday party. I'm very surprised at my surprise birthday party. What do I have my arm? What am
[2804.76s -> 2826.95s]  I holding? Is that like a clipboard or an iPad? One more and I'm going to move on. These are very
[2826.95s -> 2849.38s]  good though. They're very good. I feel like chats is going to be chat's favorite. I can't play. I
[2849.38s -> 2854.31s]  can't play this game. Okay. I'm going to just be quiet. I'm going to shut up and I'm even if it's
[2854.31s -> 2857.59s]  scary, I'm just going to go and I'm going to play it. I don't care. Fucking come get me. I don't
[2857.59s -> 2918.01s]  care. I can't. I quit. This is the first time I've ever quitting a game. How do I get out of here?
[2918.01s -> 2962.92s]  I can't hide under the table. Oh, Bugleberry radio. I wish we would just go away for even five
[2962.92s -> 3007.98s]  minutes. He's just camping me. You know what? I feel like I'm playing and it's a game I never
[3007.98s -> 3018.57s]  beat and I just rage quit it. I was just, I scare rage quit it. That grandma game for iPad. I
[3018.57s -> 3048.01s]  couldn't do it and I was like, I'm just fucking uninstalling this. Oh, we're in a circle.
[3051.43s -> 3057.86s]  That was the chicken. That was a fucking rooster. That was a rooster. That was actually a rooster.
[3057.86s -> 3064.62s]  That was a chicken. That was like a, what the? Oh, bandage. Nice. Hide. This game's impossible.
[3064.62s -> 3086.15s]  This game's not possible. This game's actually impossible. It seems to be something in the pipe.
[3086.15s -> 3112.90s]  I can't reach it. Okay. That's not rusty though. I need like a stick. Nothing in there. God. The
[3112.90s -> 3121.37s]  valve was rusty. That's right. That was down in the basement, right? I can't carry any more objects.
[3121.37s -> 3135.74s]  What are you talking about? Oh, I just put, I can't carry any more items. Where should I put this?
[3135.74s -> 3146.28s]  Oh, right here. I'm going to put it right here. I'm going to hide under. I'm going to hide under
[3146.28s -> 3214.22s]  the bed. Okay. Put it down right here and put it down. Oh, was that a key? I got a key of some kind
[3214.22s -> 3228.36s]  and a trunk. Can I open this? Okay. Open the trunk with the key, dude. Excuse me. Open the trunk with
[3228.36s -> 3234.78s]  that key right now. I can't get in my inventory. Why? My inventory doesn't work. Inventory doesn't
[3234.78s -> 3253.48s]  work. Why does my inventory not work? Tab. It's broken. I actually can't use my inventory. Yeah.
[3253.48s -> 3273.72s]  Tab. I. Tab and I. Yeah. Doesn't work. Tab. Try hiding again. Maybe it'll reset it. God damn it.
[3273.72s -> 3286.46s]  Please, man. Don't even. Why is his own fire? Oh, what? What the fuck happened? This is why I
[3286.46s -> 3311.48s]  couldn't. What the hell is happening to me? Okay. I can use my inventory again. Where's the, where's
[3311.48s -> 3342.10s]  the door that I just was at? Where's the door? Where's the, where's that door? Rust. Rust. Where's
[3342.10s -> 3393.30s]  the, where is it? Where is, where is it? What happened? I just shut down my computer. I think
[3393.30s -> 3408.34s]  I shut my computer. I think I shut my computer down. I opened the power menu and it shut. Dude,
[3408.34s -> 3428.06s]  what? How do you? I quit. I quit this game. You start at the beginning every time. You start at
[3428.06s -> 3473.69s]  the beginning every time. There's no checkpoints. Huh? I don't even want to. I mean, these are just
[3473.69s -> 3482.66s]  weird. These are just weird now. I'm just going for a speed run. Fuck it. I'm going for a speed
[3482.66s -> 3507.43s]  run right now. Chemicals are upstairs. So many fucking doors in this house. I don't even know
[3507.43s -> 3543.21s]  where. I get so lost so easily. I can't play these. I need the alarm clock to throw in there. Alarm
[3543.21s -> 3601.78s]  clock. Okay. Here he comes. Where was the alarm clock? I don't remember. I don't know. I don't
[3601.78s -> 3614.73s]  know where I am in this fucking house. I don't even know how to get downstairs. I'm serious. I
[3614.73s -> 3639.30s]  don't know how to get downstairs. I don't know how to get downstairs. How are you still chasing
[3639.30s -> 3671.67s]  me? It's impossible. You didn't even see me. I can't run anymore. I can't get away from him.
[3671.67s -> 3676.31s]  He's too fast. Dude, you can't get away from this motherfucker. You can't get away from him. He's
[3676.31s -> 3698.71s]  so fast. I can't see. I'm so bad with like permanence and locate. I can't play. I don't
[3698.71s -> 3704.79s]  fucking give a shit about this game. I don't care. I leave. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I give up.
[3723.64s -> 3732.98s]  Is there an alarm here? Every room looks exactly the fucking same and like he runs so fast and
[3732.98s -> 3736.58s]  like there's just items fucking sprinkled in every corner and you're gonna take the fucking alarm
[3736.58s -> 3739.70s]  clock out of this room and then go to go up there and then take the fucking rust pour and pour that
[3739.70s -> 3769.64s]  and get the chemical and get the chemical and then get the key. I have to hide immediately.
[3769.64s -> 3773.72s]  He's like already in the fucking room and he's gonna grab me out of this canister and he's gonna
[3773.72s -> 3793.91s]  slash my head. Stop. Why is he still here? He should not be coming back in this room.
[3793.91s -> 3831.64s]  Going upstairs. Okay. I think I've got every item that I need. There's nothing else down here,
[3831.64s -> 3840.31s]  right? I got the valve is down here. I gotta bring. I gotta go all the way upstairs, get the
[3840.31s -> 3865.03s]  rust remover and bring it down here. If I'm gonna try that problem is I don't even know how to get
[3865.03s -> 3870.01s]  up. I need like a fable to breadcrumb trail, dude. I like seriously. I can't even know what hallway
[3870.01s -> 3881.67s]  we're in and he's just right up your ass the whole time and I don't want to turn the light on
[3881.67s -> 3919.11s]  because it'll attract him. See, I don't, I can't commit anything to memory because my brain is in
[3919.11s -> 3934.09s]  a constant state of distress. So I can't commit anything to memory straight across from that weird
[3934.09s -> 3973.34s]  door is the basement. Okay. I gotta remember that. I need to draw a map. He's just, he's just,
[3973.34s -> 3976.86s]  you do. I have to speed run because the dude just never going to leave me alone. Just get out of my
[3976.86s -> 3999.22s]  way. Fuck you buddy. That's fine. I quit. I quit this game. I quit this game. Where's the stairs
[3999.22s -> 4022.73s]  to go up the stairs? I quit this game. Draw a map. Do you want me to draw a map? I can't. I'm just
[4022.73s -> 4043.62s]  trying to lose him. Do you can't lose the guy. I can't lose him. Why is he still right behind me?
[4043.62s -> 4078.86s]  Dude, you can't see in your own fucking house. That's horse shit. Which way is it? Right here,
[4078.86s -> 4088.28s]  right? Get out of the fucking way. You huge asshole. Dude, what do you even?
[4099.30s -> 4128.14s]  Rust remover and paint can room valve in basement alarm clock and fireplace room door with hole
[4128.14s -> 4139.43s]  in the room with the two bedrooms. Thank you for the help. All right. I'm just,
[4139.43s -> 4149.08s]  I'm going to try this one more time. This dude's up your ass the whole game. He doesn't go like
[4149.08s -> 4154.25s]  disappear for like a minute. No, he's just, he's here. It's terrifying. It's horrible. And he's
[4154.25s -> 4175.82s]  going to stand here like a dick. I bet she comes back in the room. The alarm clock is random.
[4175.82s -> 4241.48s]  This is really, that's so horrible. Okay. How do I get up the stairs? This is a door that leads
[4241.48s -> 4270.98s]  to another door, which leads to the stairs up. He's walking by. Okay. Downstairs is there. That
[4270.98s -> 4297.29s]  means he is another door over here. I think it's straight ahead. Is he upstairs or downstairs?
[4297.29s -> 4318.89s]  Is he, where is he? Is he upstairs? I think he's upstairs. Like, is he upstairs? What the fuck,
[4318.89s -> 4329.66s]  dude? Why? Where am I? Yeah. Go look in here. There's a fucking clock in here. Oh my God.
[4350.47s -> 4356.74s]  You can lower the, I'm getting Luigi. All right. I'm getting Luigi. This change will be permanent
[4356.74s -> 4360.74s]  and you will only be able to play again at the real difficulty. If you start a new game,
[4360.74s -> 4364.18s]  if you continue without making changes, this message will be displayed again. If you die
[4364.18s -> 4372.30s]  again, do you want to lower the enemy difficulty? I can't believe I got fucking Luigi. I can't
[4372.30s -> 4380.78s]  believe it. I'm too. I don't care. I want to see this. I want to see. I don't care. I don't care.
[4380.78s -> 4416.98s]  I'm getting Luigi. I don't even care. I'm going to laugh my ass off. Can you imagine if I die
[4416.98s -> 4483.34s]  like three more times and it's like, do you want it even easier? Fuck isn't here. Get out of here.
[4483.34s -> 4509.26s]  Get the fuck out of here. Get out of this hallway. Like get out of this hallway. You chump. Okay.
[4509.26s -> 4565.59s]  All right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Where's it? Where's the clock coming down
[4565.59s -> 4575.50s]  here? You should try murder house. I played murder house. I beat it. That was pretty,
[4575.58s -> 4598.07s]  that was recently. I don't know if he's still here. Where's, I don't have the clock though.
[4598.07s -> 4653.46s]  Can't hide under that. Where's the clock? I don't know where he is, but he's, I don't know. I don't
[4653.46s -> 4692.57s]  know. You can't be serious. Right when I come out of the fucking hiding, he's now walking around here.
[4692.57s -> 4708.74s]  You can't, I'm not even scared anymore. You're just making me angry. You're just pissing me off.
[4708.74s -> 4732.20s]  I need to hide right now. I need to hide right now. I would love to just jump out of here and
[4732.20s -> 4739.38s]  jump scare him. Grab the sickle out of his hand and just right in his head. Don't even, you open
[4739.38s -> 4743.35s]  that and I'm fucking uninstalling again. If you open this cabinet, I'm going to uninstall the game.
[4743.35s -> 4766.09s]  Thank you. You still here? What are you still doing? Okay. He went upstairs. I think he's upstairs.
[4766.09s -> 4773.56s]  All right. Valve time. You know what I mean? Like they say, they're going to make a game and then
[4773.56s -> 4795.77s]  it takes like another extra few years working on valve time. The rust is still dissolving.
[4795.77s -> 4798.79s]  I probably should hide. He's going to come down and go like,
[4801.11s -> 4822.57s]  whatever he says. Still dissolving. I was sitting here the whole time. I don't care.
[4822.65s -> 4865.59s]  There's a raid from where? I didn't see a raid. What does that do? Water is already flowing in
[4865.59s -> 4874.54s]  the pipes. I should check the bathrooms. Oh, the sink. There's a sink that has right wherever that
[4874.54s -> 4892.87s]  is. I don't remember where that sink is. You look like Kenneth Copeland for a few frames here. What?
[4892.87s -> 4905.77s]  Oh my God. My eyes are bugging out of my head. My, holy shit. My eyes almost come out of my head,
[4905.77s -> 4946.62s]  out of my socket. How do I save this? This is a crazy image. Watch my eyes. That's insane.
[4949.54s -> 4965.34s]  Skeleton for a few frames. All right. Back to this. Check the bathrooms. All right. He's down
[4965.34s -> 4972.38s]  here again. Wait till he comes. He's going to walk through here. Or should I just run for it?
[4972.38s -> 5007.29s]  Where's the bathroom? Don't sprint. It's instantly going to give away with the other.
[5008.09s -> 5035.88s]  I'm getting speech jammed by butyl berry. Sorry. Only sprint when he's chasing you.
[5035.88s -> 5056.28s]  Okay. Everybody's under the tables, reached over and just like did this like out in the hall.
[5056.28s -> 5074.63s]  Okay. I need a bathroom. I don't know. Is he, did he try? Is he turning around? He's in there.
[5074.63s -> 5085.58s]  Okay. He just went up the stairs. This is my opportunity. My opportunity. Opportunity.
[5085.58s -> 5104.49s]  Let's go. Don't sprint. Bathroom. Is he above me or is he over here? I think he's above me.
[5104.49s -> 5117.96s]  What is this? This is like, I got to get something to break that open with. Bathroom. Here we go.
[5117.96s -> 5146.49s]  Oh shit. He's right there. Right next to me. Where's the bathroom with the thing that was
[5146.49s -> 5197.24s]  in the sink? It's upstairs. I haven't heard him move. He's like over here. He's up here.
[5197.24s -> 5252.14s]  I'm dead. Oh, I hate this. It's on easy mode. It's on easy mode. I'm just going up the stairs.
[5252.14s -> 5266.74s]  I don't give a shit if he hears me. I thought he was downstairs. Oh my God. That was the worst
[5266.74s -> 5275.08s]  thing ever. That was probably the worst thing ever. I quit. That was the worst thing ever.
[5275.08s -> 5281.75s]  I thought he was downstairs. I actually thought he was downstairs. I thought he was downstairs.
[5282.89s -> 5297.29s]  Nothing. Well, that hurt my whole body. I don't think I can play this. Okay. You took my advice
[5297.29s -> 5313.67s]  for three minutes and then you said fuck it and he immediately died. He wouldn't get away from
[5313.67s -> 5319.86s]  upstairs. I was waiting and waiting and waiting. I was hiding under the table and I heard it's him
[5319.86s -> 5325.62s]  going up and down the top floor. So I'm just like, all right. I don't care. I'm going up there.
[5325.62s -> 5333.90s]  I'm doing it my way. I'm doing it my way. Your way is correct. My way is stupid and it's going
[5333.90s -> 5373.37s]  to get me killed. But I'm going for it. Not now. Not now. Not now. Please not now. I'm going to
[5373.37s -> 5397.82s]  sneeze. No, we're supposed to be doing this my way. I got the rust. We're going downstairs. Turn
[5397.82s -> 5409.30s]  the valve on. Fuck it. Run upstairs. What am I doing here? This is not my way. This is my way.
[5409.30s -> 5460.63s]  Where's the valve? This is my way. Okay. Now I need to go get clock. We're doing it my way.
[5460.63s -> 5489.34s]  Clock is upstairs. Clock is up. Fireplace. The rust is dissolving. The sink will be available.
[5489.34s -> 5509.11s]  This is an Adventure Time bit right now. What happened in Adventure Time? Okay. So there's a
[5509.11s -> 5515.45s]  bathroom up here. I got to fish out whatever's in the sink. I then have whatever's in the sink.
[5515.45s -> 5526.71s]  I still need the alarm clock. I didn't turn the valve. Oh my God. You're right. All right.
[5526.71s -> 5534.33s]  That sucks. I'm in trouble now. Oh, that actually sucks. I think it's over.
[5544.10s -> 5595.72s]  Close it. Close it. Is he still here? I think he's gone. Yeah. He went back upstairs. Okay.
[5595.72s -> 5606.63s]  Now we got to go all the way upstairs. What's up, buddy? What's up, buddy? What's up, buddy?
[5606.63s -> 5623.74s]  I need the clock. He went upstairs. I need the clock. There's no clock. Okay. Guys,
[5623.74s -> 5630.31s]  where's the clock? Honestly, where's the clock? It's not in here and I haven't seen it in any
[5630.31s -> 5646.15s]  other room. Just tell me where it is. Oh, Raid. Oh, Mr. Sark. What's up, Sark? Thank you, Mr.
[5646.15s -> 5653.32s]  Sark, for the raid. Welcome, everybody. I'm currently about to rage quit this game and
[5653.32s -> 5657.37s]  never play it again. You're in the middle of it. You're coming in right with that. This is the
[5658.01s -> 5663.59s]  fiftieth attempt. I had to put it on easy. They can't do it. It's a pretty fun game,
[5663.59s -> 5680.63s]  I would say. I'm about to uninstall it. Pretty good. Where is the clock? It's a wrench. It's
[5680.63s -> 5692.87s]  too hot. Are you serious? Just grab it quick. Gotta get upstairs again, right?
[5700.28s -> 5717.16s]  There seems to be something in the pipe. I can't. It didn't happen. It didn't push it up from the
[5717.16s -> 5734.89s]  water. It seems to be something. I can't. How do I use the sink? I need the wrench. How do I need
[5734.89s -> 5749.37s]  to get water to put the fire out, to get the wrench to come up here? How do I put the fire out
[5749.37s -> 5780.41s]  from the tub? I need something to hold. Find the alarm clock. The key you get unlocks a save point.
[5780.41s -> 5800.09s]  Really? Cork, cork, cork. Is it right here? I have something to cut it with. I need to
[5800.09s -> 5813.50s]  get scissors or scissors. But anyway, say thanks to Sark for the raid. Follow Sark. An awesome dude.
[5813.50s -> 5823.29s]  Get the key. Key. All right. Just give me a route to take. The key is a route. I need a route.
[5823.29s -> 5838.17s]  I gotta go. Alarm clock, bedroom, fire, key. But I don't know where the alarm clock is.
[5841.91s -> 5847.82s]  It's in a random spot, apparently. I don't know where the alarm clock is. Alarm clock, key, plywood
[5847.82s -> 5907.19s]  door. It's a random spawn on the second floor. You buddy. Not in here. Random spawn on the second
[5907.19s -> 5931.10s]  floor. Spawn on the second floor. Where's this dumbass clock? Shitting me. Okay, now we gotta
[5931.10s -> 5948.25s]  go upstairs. Get my bearings. It's up. Hide. Get them to run into the door. Get the lock. Get the
[5948.25s -> 5953.83s]  key. Come back down here. Open up the thing with the boarded hallway. And then apparently that's a
[5953.83s -> 5969.00s]  checkpoint. Okay, I'm going for it. I'm going. No, I'm not. He's still here. Why can't I just press,
[5969.00s -> 5976.41s]  like, like B and get, like, the fucking seam through the wall? Every video game has that now.
[5976.41s -> 6008.74s]  Every video game has it. Put it in this. I'm doing it my way. I gotta listen closely
[6008.74s -> 6034.98s]  because if it sounds from... Is he up here or is he downstairs? I don't know. I'm here. I made it.
[6034.98s -> 6044.01s]  Okay, give me a second. I think he was up here, actually. That's terrifying. He was. He was up
[6044.01s -> 6068.22s]  here. I just didn't see him. Okay, so, lock. Get in there. Grab the key. Downstairs to that plywood
[6068.22s -> 6146.49s]  thing on the wall, right? Open that. Look, people are dancing. Get out of here, man. You're making
[6146.49s -> 6163.43s]  me angry. We get this weird cutscene again. Yep. Okay, this is the... Right? Okay, okay. Yep.
[6163.43s -> 6201.91s]  Ah! Okay, don't get caught here. Okay, okay. Here we are. It's right here. Isn't it right here?
[6201.91s -> 6212.66s]  It's right here, right? This is it? What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong, though?
[6212.74s -> 6222.55s]  What's wrong? I didn't even read what it said. What does it say? What does it say?
[6222.55s -> 6231.54s]  I couldn't read it. I need to remove rust and then... Okay, this guy's a real piece of shit,
[6231.54s -> 6271.19s]  I'll tell you. Is he gone? I wish this thing would shut up so I could hear.
[6299.21s -> 6316.06s]  Is it open? Is the door... The door's open. Is it the wrong door? That's the wrong door. Where is it?
[6325.62s -> 6330.79s]  It's the hallway in front of that one. I just wish it would go upstairs or something. Just go away.
[6330.79s -> 6339.03s]  Go downstairs. Go upstairs. Go anywhere else. He walked that over there. Well, that way on your
[6339.03s -> 6365.48s]  screen because it's flipped. He went to the left. Go the fuck away. Go away. Go away. Why is he still
[6365.48s -> 6453.48s]  here? Go away. Go away. Go upstairs. Go away. I hate this game so much. I actually... I'm done with it.
[6453.48s -> 6478.41s]  I'm just done. If I die again, I'm over. It's over. Damn it. Okay, open. He's coming down here
[6478.41s -> 6497.53s]  and he won't leave me alone. He won't leave me be. He won't leave me alone. If you die... Hold on.
[6497.53s -> 6501.61s]  If you die before you manage to unlock that padlock, I'm going to unsubscribe.
[6501.61s -> 6508.94s]  You're not even subscribed. I think you don't have to change anything. You're not even subbed.
[6508.94s -> 6537.18s]  Still down here? You piece of shit. I swear to God. Where's the door? Where's the door?
[6537.34s -> 6580.01s]  Oh, fuck. I've never played this game again. This person... That person was subbed for three months.
[6580.01s -> 6599.37s]  Oh. Oh, sorry. No, they're not subbed. They're not subbed. They've been following... Okay.
[6599.37s -> 6605.62s]  So they aren't subbed. I'm waiting till I hear that sound go off and then I'm going back up.
[6605.62s -> 6610.54s]  I'm going to unsub if you don't get that padlock off. All right. The amount of fucking unsub Andy's
[6610.54s -> 6624.39s]  in the chat, apparently, if I can't open this door. They said Omega Low. I got gifted a free sub.
[6624.39s -> 6672.42s]  Omega Low. Get out of here. On your left. I know. I'm fucking scared, man. He's going to come and get
[6672.42s -> 6684.20s]  me. I thought he was right in the hallway next door. I can't even see. I don't know. He could
[6684.20s -> 6703.77s]  kill me right now. I don't know. You were right there. The game uses your microphone. It doesn't.
[6703.77s -> 6772.46s]  I got it. Don't move. I can't carry any more objects. Crowbar. Should I drop something?
[6772.46s -> 6796.20s]  Sub stays. I saved it. I saved it. Do I need this anymore? Okay. There's a panel I can open
[6796.20s -> 6801.72s]  with the crowbar. I'm so happy. I'm just going to run out. I'm just going to do it my way now.
[6801.72s -> 6808.84s]  Can you read the dialogue? What do you mean? Wait. What do you mean? Limited saves?
[6812.60s -> 6882.82s]  What the fuck? We're doing it my way. You have to hide, you fucking idiot. What's even in there?
[6882.82s -> 6893.66s]  Love Tweed. Hey, Love Tweed. Thanks for the raid. Welcome. Thanks for the raid. Playing a game. I'm
[6893.66s -> 6899.42s]  about to rage quit it. I'm about to rage quit this game. Welcome. Hope you had a good stream.
[6901.08s -> 6909.66s]  I'm ready to play. And I'm doing it my way, by the way. But no, welcome. Thanks for the raid.
[6909.66s -> 6926.78s]  What is in here? Diary and a... It's missing batteries. Okay. I don't... What should I drop?
[6926.78s -> 6934.23s]  I'm going to drop. Which I don't even know what to drop here. Why? How am I inventory so bad?
[6934.23s -> 6956.71s]  Do I still need the crowbar? Someone's coming. Use the rope in the hole? Yeah.
[6956.71s -> 6977.53s]  But I need to pick up whatever this is. Can I open the fridge with the crowbar?
[6977.53s -> 7002.92s]  Okay. Let's get it. Where is it? Okay. I got the diary. Very bad at diary.
[7003.80s -> 7010.23s]  I don't like being here. The house is very dirty and smells like garbage. It only feeds me.
[7017.85s -> 7026.58s]  Why can I not read this hiding under here? Why can I not read this hiding? It's a book.
[7026.58s -> 7036.22s]  You seem pissy tonight. What? I'm playing a scary game. It's a scary environment, man.
[7036.22s -> 7058.14s]  Go read it in the save room. Oh, good idea. Where's the save room again? I don't remember.
[7058.14s -> 7078.36s]  Let's read this diary. Um, it feeds me raw meat. It tastes really bad, although at least he feeds
[7078.36s -> 7086.55s]  me and doesn't look lock me up like mom and dad did. Today, my new father got angry with me because
[7086.55s -> 7094.04s]  I grew up in my food, but I couldn't help it. He took my stuff and threw it down the well in
[7094.04s -> 7100.23s]  the basement. Although luckily I had my video game console hidden away. Tonight, I was brave
[7100.23s -> 7104.07s]  and went down to the basement, but I got scared when I got close to the well because I heard
[7104.07s -> 7110.70s]  someone screaming inside. So I, uh, I ran out into my room. I'm getting moved to the food
[7110.70s -> 7119.32s]  my new dad gives me. I think I like it. I'm getting used to the, all right. Today we went hunting and
[7119.32s -> 7126.33s]  come back with lots of new meat. Father told me that we have to leave them alive until we need
[7126.33s -> 7132.74s]  them to eat that way. They stay fresh and the meat tastes better. I don't know why the smell of me
[7132.74s -> 7138.81s]  new home bothered me. Now I find it cozy. I don't want to be anywhere else but here. What does that
[7138.81s -> 7164.09s]  even tell me? I'm going up. I'm going up. I'm going to run out. We're doing it my way. I'm going to
[7164.09s -> 7176.33s]  get into the, we're going upstairs. Drop the diary. Yeah. Good call. Should I pick up the, uh, crowbar
[7176.33s -> 7226.17s]  again? What can I nuts? Fuck. Um, I'm going upstairs. Is he up here? He's up here. He's up here.
[7227.13s -> 7278.46s]  I need the wrench. You man. You idiot. You idiot. Get out of the fucking way. Use the rope for the
[7278.46s -> 7296.50s]  wrench. I ain't going to make it. I ain't going to make it. Thanks for watching this stream everybody.
[7296.50s -> 7300.38s]  You guys have been great. I'll definitely see you tomorrow. We're going to be playing, uh,
[7300.38s -> 7306.10s]  Breath of the Wild for an hour or two. And then we're going to do one more Omega sponsored Gotham
[7306.10s -> 7323.90s]  night stream. We'll play Breath of the Wild first. And that doesn't work. Doesn't work. Doesn't work.
[7324.54s -> 7352.46s]  What time? 2 p.m. tomorrow. 2 p.m. Pacific. Breath of the Wild first. Gotham nights. And that's
[7352.46s -> 7368.65s]  probably it. Tomorrow's going to be a little shorter. All right. What, what's the, where am I
[7368.65s -> 7380.36s]  going? Use the get the rope. Can I put that down downstairs in the basement? Can I go, can I drop
[7380.36s -> 7385.21s]  that down in the well in the basement where the padlock was? Use the crowbar on the floor near the
[7385.21s -> 7399.80s]  diary. Um, I don't remember. Where's the crowbar? Did I, where did I drop the crowbar? I hate being
[7399.80s -> 7429.16s]  in this room. The kitchen. Ah, that's not the kitchen. That's the bathroom. What are you doing?
[7429.16s -> 7439.78s]  You fucking dumb. Are you dumb? Why would I come out? I'm, I'm not like Burger King or something.
[7439.78s -> 7442.98s]  You know what I mean? I want Burger King right now. I'm going, I'm going to go. I want Burger King.
[7442.98s -> 7458.34s]  I'm getting to Burger King. Yeah, I'm going to get Burger King. How many bandages? Okay. Now
[7458.34s -> 7468.25s]  use this where the diary was. Lower where the di- I'm going in here. Just be safe.
[7468.25s -> 7496.15s]  Should I save it? Should I save the game? No. So you're saying the diary or the trunk you couldn't
[7496.15s -> 7535.54s]  open. That's right. I, I tried the trunk. The trunk was up here. It's that. Video game and a note.
[7535.54s -> 7576.52s]  Dude, does the note say? Can I open this? Stop, stop. Stop. It's open. I gotta close it. Back to where
[7576.52s -> 7598.66s]  you found the diary. Pick up the game console. I can't play this game. Combination of the lock
[7598.66s -> 7602.50s]  in the well is the same as my score in the mutant horde game. Although I don't remember it. And for
[7602.50s -> 7619.70s]  a debris pair, I have to get more than 6,000 points. Sick. All right. All right. Okay. Grab the
[7620.26s -> 7641.62s]  game cartridge. Grab the game console. Get the padlock key. Okay. Do I have room though?
[7641.62s -> 7648.28s]  What do I do with the rope? Cause I can't carry anything else. I don't know what to do with the
[7648.28s -> 7685.58s]  rope and these batteries too. Should I save it? I think I'm going to save it. I think I gotta stop.
[7685.58s -> 7700.65s]  I'm going to save it. It's probably a stupid idea. No, but I'm doing it. Yeah. I gotta stop. My brain
[7700.65s -> 7721.77s]  is, is on, is my brain's fucked up. Yeah. I'm stopping. This is ridiculous. I can't believe
[7721.77s -> 7729.05s]  I even showed that. I'm, I'm covered in water. I don't even want to show you my back. It's fucked.
[7729.05s -> 7740.71s]  This is, it's a horror game. All right. All right. That, uh, it saved in case I ever come back to
[7740.71s -> 7748.54s]  this game. This is fucked up. This whole game was a fucking nightmare. It's disgusting. You're
[7748.54s -> 7757.43s]  whatever. You're fine. Yeah, that's going to be it. Uh, I'll see you guys tomorrow. Uh,
[7757.43s -> 7768.39s]  tomorrow is breath of the wild and, uh, Gotham Knights. I will probably open with this when I
[7768.39s -> 7781.16s]  play, uh, stay out of the house. Yeah. You've been good. You guys have been good. You get to have it.
[7783.40s -> 7796.86s]  That was fun. Again, uh, thanks for sticking around and you kind of jumbling around a lot
[7796.86s -> 7805.62s]  the last day or two, but it's been a lot of fun. This dream has been very fun and having a blast.
[7805.62s -> 7810.87s]  Gotham Knights is going to conclude tomorrow. Tomorrow's stream is only going to be probably
[7810.87s -> 7818.52s]  four hours long. We'll play breath of the wild for like two hours to three hours and then move to
[7818.52s -> 7836.71s]  Gotham Knights for a couple hours. 2 PM Pacific, but just make it 2 30. Be safe. Appreciate it.
[7836.71s -> 7842.02s]  Thanks guys. Thanks for hanging out. Thanks for the raids. I'm going to get some food and take a
[7842.02s -> 7887.32s]  shower. Have a great night. Take care. Call your mother. See you soon.
