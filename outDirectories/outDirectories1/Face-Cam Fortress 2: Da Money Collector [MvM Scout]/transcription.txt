[0.31s -> 15.42s]  Hey, what is going on everybody Jerma here with face cam fortress 2 and I'm here with a couple of other dudes

[21.46s -> 28.12s]  Hey guys should be 2142 here. So, uh, yeah, we're playing some man-up mode
[28.16s -> 36.67s]  So that means we're spending tickets and we're doing this on cool town. Which one are doing the CPU slaughter or uh, this is I
[37.03s -> 42.01s]  Think this is CPU slaughter. It's not control. I'll delete. I don't think yeah, it is if you'll tab you can see so
[42.55s -> 45.83s]  So I was waiting for a German to ready up for me
[45.83s -> 54.50s]  Yeah, a little sniper action going on here playing as the scouts stealth. What are you the demo man? Mm-hmm? Yeah
[54.50s -> 60.76s]  Oh, look at that little thing you got and yeah, I guess my joke wasn't very funny about me saying I should be 21 for this
[64.12s -> 66.30s]  No, that's very insensitive

[122.08s -> 124.08s]  Sticky launcher and that's it
[124.32s -> 128.20s]  I'm using the force of nature the mad milk and the candy cane
[128.80s -> 131.60s]  To get that health from killing these robots
[132.28s -> 137.14s]  I'm using the heat maker. Oh, yeah, pretty interesting once you get the focus

[340.90s -> 347.35s]  We could always say it's any of the days of the week watch the video. Yeah, it's probably up now
[350.41s -> 353.22s]  I wouldn't say go that far
[353.78s -> 355.78s]  Just like tapes
[356.66s -> 358.03s]  All right
[358.03s -> 362.23s]  What I didn't even see what we had this round two big heavies two big soldiers all I saw was spy support

[363.92s -> 368.77s]  Get the money get the money. Oh for those of you watching right now
[368.77s -> 373.67s]  There's something I did not even know and why I never wanted to play scout for a man versus machine you get
[374.25s -> 378.81s]  Overhealed for every single dollar you collect. I did not know I have like 500 health right now, right? Yeah
[378.81s -> 383.09s]  I get full of a 400 right now. It's just like are you serious? That's insanity. It's by support
[383.25s -> 390.12s]  Wow, oh that was a spy right there. I thought they spawned behind us. I do that guy just spawned right in my face
[391.32s -> 398.15s]  That guy legit was just right. They're smart, man. Yeah, they get a huge upper hand. Give me the money
[398.15s -> 405.66s]  They know I didn't yeah. No, I didn't it's up here. Well, there's still $22 missing. Where is it?
[405.66s -> 410.66s]  Oh, I couldn't have even gotten it. It was all the way back here behind the uh, oh no, we are really no
[410.66s -> 413.26s]  We got it. We got it. That was weird. I was like weird glitch
[413.30s -> 420.26s]  Oh, yeah, I have no health gosh. Oh, thanks for mad milk in those. I actually got health back because of them
[420.74s -> 429.54s]  That's what I'm here. This is margin Ford. There's no health. He's almost dead. Yeah, just get rid of him. Yeah
[431.23s -> 435.98s]  Hooray, it's more more spy. Okay, watch out money. They're like spawn on us
[435.98s -> 442.38s]  Oh, if you're watching this video, right and you're wondering why if you're wondering why I keep hitting tab to look at the like the scoreboard
[442.70s -> 445.82s]  I'm looking at the money collected see in the lower left collected and missed
[445.82s -> 450.10s]  That's so I can tell if I've missed the money. Oh, oh my god
[450.78s -> 456.57s]  I just went a thousand free there. Help me die
[460.04s -> 468.73s]  This guy's coming to milk you can stand while picking your nose up for a second. Hey Rockets money money money
[469.25s -> 474.29s]  Money, yeah, just try to pick those pick those medics off. Oh, there's a bunch of money back here. Oh
[474.41s -> 477.16s]  Oh
[478.04s -> 485.93s]  Bomb all right, these guys both have used their uber trying to kill the medic only I had more
[486.29s -> 491.06s]  Yes, run. All right. That guy does not have any more medics on the right neither
[491.06s -> 496.10s]  Does this so no this he just uber damn it. You're a spy right now. Wait, you're a spy
[496.18s -> 504.46s]  That's that was a spy for sure got all the money so far. Oh, no, you guys are right over there. No, yes
[504.90s -> 506.10s]  No
[506.10s -> 510.18s]  No, this medic this medic just ubered. I didn't get him. So we have a giant heavy
[510.74s -> 513.70s]  Alright, just focus on the soldier. He's gonna he still has a medic on him
[516.34s -> 522.06s]  Our bomb is about to be destroyed. Yeah, I got the money right? Yeah
[523.12s -> 529.20s]  That makes me happy that makes me real here a ton of scouts on the left. Holy crap
[529.20s -> 540.11s]  Oh, just don't let him in do not let these bastards in this is it. This is it. This is why this is why so
[540.71s -> 542.71s]  everywhere
[543.87s -> 549.94s]  One more last round. Oh, okay. I was I was spending money like it was last wave
[555.90s -> 562.32s]  Okay, what I got fully upgraded that yeah, this sniper's a little okay clip size
[563.04s -> 571.52s]  And ready up. We'll go with that. Ah, no spy sport. We're also gonna go with an uber canteen
[572.04s -> 576.42s]  Because I feel like it. All right, three tanks two deflectors. Oh
[577.99s -> 583.31s]  Really the tanks. I'm not that worried about it deflectors on the other hand
[583.31s -> 592.64s]  Yeah, I was a dude deflectors come with three or more medics usually. Um, well, there's 18 total medics
[592.64s -> 594.64s]  So I'm assuming that they're gonna be
[594.64s -> 601.30s]  Spread out six each nine each. Well, I mean they could be on the the heavies as well
[605.75s -> 611.58s]  Medics could be on tanks. They'll be so unfair. I'd be really easy because kill the medic
[612.30s -> 614.30s]  They're all
[614.30s -> 620.55s]  All 18 minutes. Oh, they're just but the tank you have to beat the way before the tank with the uber
[622.52s -> 625.84s]  Alright, this is sniper support though. This could be a real pain in the ass. So
[627.10s -> 632.62s]  Be careful facing snipers is so scary. There's like ten at a time and like nobody has like killed
[634.86s -> 641.93s]  Yeah, it is pretty terrifying like the wave gets pushed back so all the snipers like merge into one position and you just like
[641.93s -> 644.81s]  Walk to the front lines and just
[646.90s -> 652.51s]  And our heavy has invested in jump height. Wait, did he really wait? Hold on. Yeah. Oh
[655.06s -> 662.38s]  My god, well done like this just so what just so we can do like a what is it called a triple?
[662.38s -> 667.62s]  What's it called? What's the ice skating move? I'm just watching his robot. That's the best part
[668.50s -> 670.74s]  Triple let's let's what the hell
[672.02s -> 677.35s]  I thought it was like a wangu triple ax triple axle triple axle. There you go
[677.39s -> 684.52s]  I saw the puzzle someone told me if you shoot the tracks on the sides, it does more damage that person might say
[685.18s -> 689.26s]  Let's see. I don't think it's true. I don't know if it's true. I
[689.82s -> 692.58s]  Like that we can pretend it's true though
[695.13s -> 703.04s]  Well, no my god me you'll need to get that I'm gonna run right into the line of fire here
[703.98s -> 711.17s]  Yeah, actually money is is kind of important to sniper get out of he's gonna kill me with his stupid
[711.53s -> 717.45s]  Club. Yeah, go ahead. Try and hurt me. I got massive resistance, baby
[717.65s -> 727.87s]  Wait, what's this guy say about fake shibby? Oh fake shibby just added me to friends. Really nice. It's probably probably cool
[729.87s -> 736.35s]  Night where this guy's gonna try and club me again. Oh, these guys are all covered in milk have at it
[736.35s -> 739.85s]  It's a lot of rockets go from behind
[740.77s -> 743.50s]  Collect the money. Yeah
[746.62s -> 748.62s]  snipers everywhere
[748.62s -> 756.67s]  Yeah, Oh big heavy snipers, this is incredibly fun because I've I've such oh kill the max
[759.04s -> 766.97s]  I'm gonna take care of the snipers taking care of the snipers got him another one over here, huh?

[778.60s -> 781.54s]  You shouldn't have used that milk
[781.90s -> 783.90s]  Are you even playing on our team?
[784.90s -> 790.81s]  That Jerma is not one of us that Jerma is an enemy that
