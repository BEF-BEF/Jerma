[56.70s -> 60.38s]  It was my face when my face when stream starts my face when
[61.58s -> 67.62s]  What's up? Good afternoon everybody
[68.58s -> 70.58s]  Or good evening wherever you are in the world
[77.43s -> 79.03s]  Yeah, he won
[79.03s -> 80.76s]  Yeah, he won
[80.76s -> 83.80s]  Yeah, and you know who won when I say he won, you know who won
[84.60s -> 91.62s]  There was an internal fight though that I thought in my dreams last night
[93.22s -> 97.70s]  People were punching each other in the face. There was a brawl up in my brain
[98.42s -> 100.66s]  And uh
[101.06s -> 101.86s]  and
[101.86s -> 106.42s]  German jump wants to continue to jump because he's completely certain
[107.46s -> 112.42s]  He's close. He's like 60% of the way through the game. He's gonna try he's gonna go for it
[113.14s -> 119.86s]  He's addicted to the game. And uh, when you get addicted to a game you have to continue
[126.49s -> 128.33s]  I'm not addicted he is
[128.33s -> 133.80s]  It's not my fault
[133.80s -> 135.40s]  Never in my life
[135.40s -> 137.16s]  Did I ever think?
[137.24s -> 139.32s]  That there would be a message that would say
[140.12s -> 142.04s]  nancy drew
[142.04s -> 147.03s]  waiting room
[147.03s -> 154.15s]  I don't think I I couldn't I imagine like three weeks ago somebody writing that everyone would be like what are you talking about?
[154.79s -> 157.69s]  What is that person talking about? Why are they saying that?
[159.22s -> 161.22s]  Why would he ever do that?
[164.42s -> 166.42s]  No, we're going back to the drew
[167.69s -> 170.01s]  Next week. That's what we're gonna do. Don't worry
[170.97s -> 173.61s]  I told you it was already locked in I I bought them all
[175.37s -> 179.85s]  I own well, not all of them. I own a lot most of them. I own a lot of nancy drew games
[179.93s -> 181.13s]  Let's put it that way
[181.13s -> 183.48s]  I bought the bundle
[183.48s -> 186.60s]  The next one we're gonna play is nancy. You didn't beat the game. Yes, I did
[189.26s -> 193.18s]  We I got to the end that was like an eight hour experience. Well, what do you mean? I didn't beat it
[193.98s -> 197.82s]  That's because I was because I cheated
[199.26s -> 205.94s]  Whatever. That's fine
[205.94s -> 207.94s]  If you cheat and you win
[208.02s -> 209.86s]  You still win
[209.86s -> 212.26s]  You just cheated and everyone could say well you cheated
[212.82s -> 214.98s]  But you won I know but you cheated so it doesn't count
[215.54s -> 218.74s]  Although we still got to see it. So who cares what what cost it's all right
[219.70s -> 227.16s]  He's mad main game plus the dlc now that I am not going to say
[228.87s -> 231.91s]  I am going to try to do the main game
[233.70s -> 236.18s]  If I get it done
[236.18s -> 238.12s]  If I get it done
[238.12s -> 240.58s]  then only then
[240.58s -> 243.54s]  Will we move on to the dlc and I will probably just not complete it
[243.78s -> 246.50s]  I'll get up to the first two or three screens to go. Nah, no, thanks
[247.30s -> 251.46s]  The dlc is extra content. So it's not like it has to be there
[253.90s -> 256.70s]  When you fall back to the start of the drain i'm going to get dinner
[269.02s -> 275.06s]  That's fair that's fair that does that it's all right that doesn't bother me that's very fair
[275.86s -> 279.16s]  I can imagine that person just well, I felt all right
[280.33s -> 284.94s]  Ordering a pizza going downstairs wherever you go. Yeah, we do have some new emotes
[285.50s -> 289.64s]  I enabled a bunch of uh better twitch tv emotes
[291.69s -> 294.78s]  They do exist
[294.86s -> 296.78s]  Does think 10 of them now
[296.78s -> 299.14s]  I didn't want to go overboard
[299.14s -> 301.62s]  I didn't want to just enable just to enable them
[303.11s -> 305.99s]  Because if you see if I start enabling 50 emails, I think that's okay
[306.39s -> 309.43s]  You guys gotta take them in in little slow drip feeds. Yeah
[310.23s -> 318.68s]  here it is
[318.68s -> 320.68s]  all right, I have to keep it together because
[321.56s -> 323.30s]  um
[323.30s -> 325.46s]  God that number makes me kind of nauseous already
[325.86s -> 328.74s]  I gotta keep this together because I haven't played it and yeah my muscle memory
[328.74s -> 330.98s]  I've got to get back to it. I gotta get back to normal
[330.98s -> 337.38s]  832 yes. Yes, I know I know. All right. Well, where am I?

[345.48s -> 350.92s]  I I drank I drank like a quarter of an emergency today. I wanted to get some extra b vitamins
[351.32s -> 353.96s]  But I feel like I feel worse today
[356.30s -> 359.66s]  You know what? I mean, I feel like I shouldn't have done that because I feel bad now
[365.16s -> 368.84s]  I I reverse vitamins myself somehow. How is that even possible?
[369.80s -> 373.96s]  Yep, well, uh, I should have I can't need to uh, can I open up like a second account?
[374.84s -> 382.98s]  I need to open up a second account and a second game and just practice
[383.54s -> 395.22s]  Oh Jesus, okay
[395.22s -> 402.76s]  No, we're all right

[429.06s -> 431.94s]  Um, just go get dinner now
[432.02s -> 434.02s]  And then maybe when you come back
[435.34s -> 441.66s]  It won't be uh
[441.66s -> 443.66s]  I took these b vitamins. What was in that?
[448.36s -> 450.36s]  Those who don't learn from history
[454.52s -> 456.52s]  Oh shit. All right. I'm okay
[457.19s -> 461.67s]  I don't this is not a bad place to be it's getting up into the snow part is where what's going to be an issue

[506.39s -> 508.39s]  We will he will never be free
[510.28s -> 513.32s]  I have to beat the base game before Joel does
[513.96s -> 515.96s]  Because then guess what?
[517.32s -> 519.32s]  When he plays this game

[568.70s -> 570.70s]  put on thunder no, let me just like
[571.90s -> 573.90s]  I'm in it for the long call tonight guys
[574.30s -> 576.30s]  I already had a stacum sandwich
[576.94s -> 579.82s]  Which by the way, can we just talk about stacums for just a second here?
[580.54s -> 582.92s]  very quickly
[582.92s -> 585.24s]  I thought that stacums would junk
[587.42s -> 589.66s]  I thought they would follow up like sodium
[590.70s -> 593.02s]  And had a bunch of preservatives and shit
[594.98s -> 600.58s]  That's there's only one ingredient. It's just beef. That's it. Nothing else is in it. There's nothing else in it
[603.35s -> 608.07s]  They're really easy. It's one minute per side in a pan and you can put it in with eggs
[612.63s -> 615.03s]  You can you can mush it up into a sandwich
[619.02s -> 621.19s]  Oh fuck this
[621.19s -> 625.03s]  This is not an advertisement. This is me telling you what you can do
[625.83s -> 628.50s]  with the stacums
[628.50s -> 630.50s]  They're pretty damn good
[630.50s -> 644.46s]  It's easy you want a quick meal i'm just telling you truth here. What can you do with raid shadow legends?
[646.26s -> 647.22s]  Nothing
[647.22s -> 653.64s]  Can you eat raid shadow legends and is it very quick only a hundred calories per sheet?
[656.62s -> 657.98s]  I don't think so
[657.98s -> 663.74s]  That's too far. Fuck. All right

[677.35s -> 682.09s]  All right, i'm starting to feel it a little more
[682.41s -> 686.97s]  It's gonna take probably like, you know, i'll give you here. Look it's gonna take an hour for me to uh
[688.12s -> 690.12s]  To to get back into this
[690.20s -> 693.80s]  Those of you know that like when I go to sleep my whole body shuts off to a point
[694.60s -> 699.00s]  Where when I wake up and move around even like like six hours later
[699.40s -> 702.60s]  It takes me like eight hours to become like a human after I wake up
[703.16s -> 708.49s]  It just I don't know why my whole it's just the way it is
[709.37s -> 711.37s]  He's possessed what?
[711.37s -> 715.14s]  Why am I possessed?
[716.54s -> 719.50s]  Dude, I really wish I could just plug myself in
[721.02s -> 723.74s]  That wouldn't be I i'm not like against that. You know what i'm saying?
[724.38s -> 727.82s]  Oh, what about the capable robots? We're gonna turn into ai. I hope so
[729.03s -> 734.47s]  I would love to just glide down and plug the back of my like a socket in my back into the wall
[735.45s -> 737.85s]  And in eight hours, I could just lie there and just rest
[738.41s -> 740.41s]  And be fully charged the next day
[742.98s -> 745.62s]  I would have to worry about my brain having to do that work
[746.42s -> 749.56s]  No, I've got a battery the thing is you'd have to have surgery
[750.92s -> 755.32s]  You'd have to have surgery on your back battery to replace your whatever it is lithium
[756.42s -> 758.74s]  uh, I would buy lithium stock because
[760.07s -> 762.47s]  That's probably you know, it's not it's finite, isn't it?
[763.03s -> 779.22s]  That's an ad was that an ad or is that advice?
[781.27s -> 783.27s]  What's the difference now?
[783.43s -> 786.41s]  Okay

[815.40s -> 819.22s]  Charge up
[819.22s -> 821.22s]  You know, it's like kind of funny. I think
[823.02s -> 828.94s]  All right. So yesterday we have to talk about this so yesterday. I think I expelled like four days worth of energy
[830.41s -> 833.69s]  I'm like up now. I got I took like vitamins and shit and i'm like
[834.41s -> 836.41s]  Yeah, i'm like slow
[840.87s -> 844.95s]  I've slowed down so much. I expelled like probably a week worth of energy yesterday
[847.46s -> 850.82s]  My body heated up and cooled down like 3,500 times
[851.46s -> 854.41s]  I'm gonna have to like shuffle coal up my ass
[855.46s -> 867.94s]  How do I power myself?
[867.94s -> 875.26s]  Excuse me. What what?
[875.26s -> 885.82s]  All right, let's get up there. Let's get up here. Come on now take a sip of this fucking b vitamin

[895.27s -> 897.27s]  Uh, the next stream is gonna be nancy drew
[897.83s -> 901.06s]  All right. I gotta be careful here. Let's go. It's like right here, right?
[902.86s -> 906.04s]  close
[906.04s -> 909.48s]  Oh
[909.48s -> 915.06s]  Damn it. Oh, yeah. Yai
[917.37s -> 918.97s]  Oh my god
[918.97s -> 932.76s]  I'm already sweating
[932.76s -> 935.16s]  Thunder don't start thunder yet
[936.74s -> 938.74s]  Oh god, damn it. Don't do this. No
[952.31s -> 954.68s]  Oh my god

[963.48s -> 968.28s]  Go get a chikootery board and put cheese and fucking figs on it and shit. It'll still be here
[968.84s -> 975.88s]  Don't worry
[975.88s -> 977.40s]  Oh my god
[977.40s -> 994.38s]  He's already at a 10. I should have opened a second account. I'm telling you I should have opened a second account
[995.53s -> 998.33s]  If I open a second account this shit don't happen
[998.97s -> 1001.21s]  I could have just jumped around and been practicing
[1002.01s -> 1007.77s]  back in the goddamn sewer
[1008.84s -> 1010.28s]  again
[1010.28s -> 1014.04s]  At least I know how to get out of here. It's only these parts up here that suck
[1026.98s -> 1028.02s]  Do what?
[1028.02s -> 1038.74s]  Get up here. I gotta get the timings right too. That's another problem
[1039.38s -> 1043.53s]  Did you go to bed and you have like nightmares about wars going on in your brain?
[1044.17s -> 1047.05s]  Three people fighting in your brain you wake up like oh fuck
[1048.63s -> 1050.63s]  What time is it? I'm like jump king
[1059.93s -> 1062.07s]  He's back in the sewer
[1062.07s -> 1067.74s]  Oh, I know i'm close though. That's the thing. You know what i'm saying?
[1068.30s -> 1070.86s]  I'm close to getting what I where I want to be
[1078.01s -> 1081.61s]  Somebody told me that the the snow portion when we get to the snow part
[1082.33s -> 1084.81s]  But that's like 70 of the way through the game
[1085.53s -> 1087.21s]  If that's real
[1087.21s -> 1089.21s]  Then like that's so close
[1095.86s -> 1099.38s]  And no i'm not talking dlc. I'm talking just the base video game
[1100.02s -> 1110.20s]  Remember, this is a 100 hour experience
[1112.30s -> 1120.49s]  No, it's not that was so long
[1124.25s -> 1126.25s]  I gotta learn how to ride the bike again
[1127.26s -> 1132.86s]  God damn it. I knew I should have just done a 24 hour stream last night. I'm dead serious
[1133.98s -> 1137.11s]  Because like all of my muscle memory is gone
[1138.84s -> 1141.16s]  I should have just did like a 16 hour stream yesterday
[1141.96s -> 1149.45s]  That was a mistake to turn it off
[1149.45s -> 1151.45s]  Start using the d-pad now good idea
[1152.65s -> 1156.41s]  Holy shit, that's brilliant
[1156.41s -> 1164.44s]  What an absolutely brilliant idea. I'm doing it now
[1168.73s -> 1170.73s]  D-pad, let's go relearn it
[1171.13s -> 1173.13s]  Just relearn the game with the d-pad
[1175.99s -> 1178.95s]  I'll not see that i'm getting used to the d-pad. That was a d-pad problem
[1199.37s -> 1201.69s]  Hey germo, i'm the guy that went to dinner
[1202.49s -> 1206.57s]  Yeah, i'm doing i'm doing an entire i'm doing an entire, uh
[1207.61s -> 1208.65s]  Hold on
[1208.65s -> 1216.98s]  Let me get up here first
[1216.98s -> 1220.50s]  Not too much god damn it man. Come on
[1221.54s -> 1222.98s]  Oh, come on
[1222.98s -> 1225.46s]  I think I might just go take a cold shower right now
[1226.34s -> 1228.81s]  You know what I mean?
[1228.81s -> 1231.93s]  I think i'm just gonna go in like freezing cold water. I think that'll help
[1232.81s -> 1236.97s]  I think i'm gonna dunk my head into into cold water and then come back
[1237.85s -> 1240.17s]  Bring the mic. I I don't think I can
[1244.60s -> 1247.16s]  Wait, what if I call myself on discord? Could I do that?
[1247.80s -> 1271.26s]  Give me a fucking break
[1271.26s -> 1273.90s]  Back in the sewer when you i'm gonna go eat dinner
[1274.78s -> 1276.23s]  Uh
[1276.23s -> 1278.79s]  Nope, i'm going the other way down again. Oh my fucking god
[1279.91s -> 1281.91s]  Trying to get used to the d-pad
[1289.86s -> 1291.86s]  Should have done a 16 hour stream last night
[1293.51s -> 1297.19s]  Yeah, this is what that should have been the first like 20 hour stream I ever did I would have beat it
[1297.91s -> 1299.91s]  You see how far we got last time
[1299.91s -> 1323.61s]  It's gonna be a long night
[1323.61s -> 1325.61s]  I'm giving it a real attempt here
[1326.17s -> 1329.21s]  But I have to spend like an hour or two getting back into the swing of things
[1329.21s -> 1332.73s]  This is what I have, you know, if you feel like eating fucking food or feel like going to a movie
[1333.69s -> 1337.45s]  You know you check the movie times. There might be a good movie out right now
[1337.45s -> 1341.85s]  You could you could go see that movie come back and then I will be back used to how the game works again
[1342.41s -> 1344.41s]  That's a fun night
[1345.32s -> 1351.93s]  If you have a significant other or something you could go see um
[1353.05s -> 1355.21s]  See up. I don't know if you've ever seen up before
[1357.14s -> 1360.74s]  And then you come to the stream you can tell me hey germa. I saw the movie up
[1362.02s -> 1363.06s]  uh
[1363.06s -> 1365.62s]  Why can't you do that? And I'd be like, okay
[1366.50s -> 1388.44s]  All right. I'm gonna give you a one criticism for d-pad over analog. I'll tell you what it is
[1389.08s -> 1391.72s]  Uh, the d-pad is shiny
[1392.52s -> 1394.52s]  It doesn't have grip so
[1394.76s -> 1397.24s]  You know, I can already foresee water issue here
[1398.28s -> 1402.89s]  You know what I mean? I think there's gonna be a
[1403.61s -> 1405.61s]  human solution issue here
[1405.93s -> 1410.57s]  Because like sweaty fingers on like a slick
[1411.37s -> 1413.51s]  shiny material
[1413.51s -> 1415.99s]  You know what i'm saying? That might not this might not be a good thing
[1416.63s -> 1423.35s]  It shouldn't even be down here
[1432.65s -> 1436.30s]  Just don't sweat
[1436.30s -> 1442.89s]  That's impossible for me. All right, i'm gonna
[1444.09s -> 1446.09s]  What's the thing that uh people listen to
[1446.25s -> 1451.05s]  All right. I'm gonna put them on i'm gonna put on the like the chill beats to like fucking hang out with your friends
[1451.05s -> 1453.05s]  Or whatever it's called. Let's go. Let's do
[1454.07s -> 1456.07s]  Relaxing beats
[1457.13s -> 1460.81s]  No, not thunder. I'm I need to I gotta chill thunder
[1462.49s -> 1465.53s]  lo-fi hip-hop radio beats to relax to
[1469.11s -> 1470.81s]  um
[1470.81s -> 1478.17s]  All right, which one is this? Um, is it gonna be claimed?
[1481.17s -> 1483.43s]  thunder lo-fi remix
[1484.47s -> 1486.47s]  Thunder acdc lo-fi
[1487.99s -> 1490.79s]  No way this exists. I've been no way
[1493.53s -> 1495.53s]  That would be so stupid
[1505.48s -> 1507.90s]  Thunderstruck remix. No, it doesn't exist
[1513.60s -> 1515.60s]  thunderstruck slow remix
[1528.33s -> 1530.33s]  Uh, this is
[1532.92s -> 1534.92s]  This is just thunderstruck slowed down
[1535.88s -> 1537.88s]  by 21 percent
[1538.12s -> 1544.65s]  See, we're just chilling on this stream. We're not
[1549.67s -> 1566.24s]  Why would you make this you know, what's what's this point? It's so unnecessary
[1567.58s -> 1574.36s]  I'm gonna fuck it up again
[1575.86s -> 1580.23s]  No
[1580.23s -> 1587.62s]  Uh, I think you can only play this game if you've eaten like a piece of salmon the day that you play it
[1589.72s -> 1595.40s]  You have to take a blood test before you play jump king and determine what all your vitamin levels are
[1595.40s -> 1598.52s]  What am I what's my vitamin d at right now? Like it has to be all at 100 percent
[1600.74s -> 1603.54s]  Uh, you gotta take a blood test. What's your potassium level at right now?
[1603.70s -> 1608.82s]  Don't play it unless you have like fucking 80 capacity of your like vitamin e levels for the day
[1609.62s -> 1611.62s]  i'm ted serious
[1611.70s -> 1627.32s]  Hello ted what?
[1627.32s -> 1639.75s]  You're like imagine playing this game without like a vitamin e supplement
[1642.33s -> 1644.33s]  And then you can use the new emote that I enabled
[1662.25s -> 1666.89s]  All right, let's get back into this here I gotta keep it together man. I gotta keep it together. You got it
[1672.06s -> 1676.06s]  The more you tell yourself you got to keep it together the less you're gonna keep it together. That's what i'm i'm certain of
[1687.53s -> 1689.53s]  All right time to get back to where I was
[1690.63s -> 1694.79s]  Up in the snow area get you know, this is actually a good thing. This is a very good thing
[1698.33s -> 1703.21s]  Because now i'm not using the analog anymore. I'm actually starting to feel the d-pad and start to get used to the d-pad
[1703.29s -> 1705.29s]  So this is this is good. This is hard for me
[1706.50s -> 1709.30s]  I get it. Yeah super frog. I gotta take in the super frog vibe
[1710.20s -> 1713.80s]  What would super frog do in this scenario? I'll tell you what super frog would do
[1716.09s -> 1746.23s]  This just pretend it's this music
[1746.87s -> 1755.18s]  It's not even the right music
[1755.18s -> 1757.50s]  Oh, there's another this is another super frog
[1758.58s -> 1762.44s]  How can there be more than one?
[1762.44s -> 1764.44s]  There's more than one super frog
[1766.07s -> 1768.07s]  This one's for the omega
[1771.22s -> 1772.26s]  what
[1772.26s -> 1778.28s]  since when
[1778.28s -> 1780.28s]  Enable super frog two
[1780.36s -> 1804.02s]  Always that one goddamn jump. Does anybody okay?
[1804.90s -> 1808.58s]  Does anybody have just like the guaranteed way to make that jump?
[1809.38s -> 1816.60s]  Like there has to be like a full-on guaranteed way to make that jump every time. What is it? Does anybody know?
[1824.54s -> 1826.76s]  No one tell him
[1826.76s -> 1828.68s]  No, tell me
[1828.68s -> 1833.48s]  So I can get out of the sewer reliably every time jump into the spot with the leaking water
[1835.80s -> 1845.61s]  What's that?
[1845.61s -> 1849.13s]  Damn it. I that looked real
[1849.13s -> 1853.05s]  I that looked real. I could that could that could have been real. It really could have been
[1865.66s -> 1871.58s]  whiz
[1871.58s -> 1874.55s]  I'm gonna try something
[1874.55s -> 1878.23s]  Oh, I found the guaranteed secret. I did it. I did it. I actually did it. I did it
[1878.23s -> 1881.03s]  I did I did I just guessed and I did it. I'll never miss this jump ever again
[1881.51s -> 1885.35s]  I will never miss this jump ever again. Not once it'll never happen again. I will never miss this jump again
[1885.35s -> 1889.11s]  It'll never happen. Oh my god. Thank god. Let's get some super frog music
[1891.45s -> 1894.33s]  Uh, you go all the way to the right and you do a full left jump
[1894.49s -> 1896.49s]  Those are you that i'm gonna save you a lot of pain
[1896.65s -> 1901.53s]  Don't try to sneak in here. You put your body all the way to the right do a full jump all the way to the left done
[1902.49s -> 1907.64s]  I will never fall down that ever again. Oh, i'm so happy about that. Can we get a guarantee on the other one, too?
[1924.23s -> 1927.35s]  Don't give joel the speedrun strats. Yeah, I just realized something
[1928.31s -> 1930.31s]  You guys can you guys can tell?
[1930.39s -> 1935.51s]  How some you could tell them how to play and how to win and shit. I don't want that to be a thing
[1937.50s -> 1940.46s]  I don't want you to be able to tell that the secret to somebody like
[1942.12s -> 1946.84s]  Other names starts with a chay then i'm gonna play this game. They're gonna look at the trailer and go. No, that's not for me
[1947.80s -> 1971.69s]  Just play the rest in secret. I could do that
[1972.41s -> 1979.58s]  Fuck it's not enough
[1981.85s -> 1986.73s]  That one's gonna kill me because that just yeah, it's just like relearning the damn game a second time
[1995.11s -> 2002.54s]  But that jump it sucks because if you miss it it's over and you're gonna go all the way back down to the dumb sewer
[2003.50s -> 2024.65s]  Imagine the whole stream got claimed because of super frog is he still in the sewer after nine hours?
[2025.37s -> 2026.95s]  um
[2026.95s -> 2028.63s]  technically, no
[2028.63s -> 2030.47s]  physically, yes
[2030.47s -> 2033.75s]  Uh, I made it up to like the sixth screen in the snow level
[2034.87s -> 2037.24s]  And then I fell
[2037.24s -> 2039.24s]  And now I have to relearn the whole game again
[2042.63s -> 2045.11s]  Damn it, man. Give me a goddamn break
[2051.58s -> 2054.62s]  See, they're too small. It's not far enough. It's not too just
[2055.26s -> 2057.26s]  You gotta this goldilocks
[2061.80s -> 2063.00s]  Guess what?
[2063.00s -> 2065.00s]  The thing that people don't understand about goldilocks
[2065.80s -> 2067.80s]  That whole story is bullshit
[2068.57s -> 2073.45s]  This one's too hot. This one's too cold. No eat eat your breakfast
[2074.25s -> 2076.25s]  Eat it. It's what we have
[2076.25s -> 2080.47s]  Okay
[2080.47s -> 2083.35s]  This bed's too soft. This bed's too cold
[2083.99s -> 2085.91s]  This bed's too hard
[2085.91s -> 2087.91s]  Well, go get a sleep number bed then
[2090.76s -> 2104.31s]  And stop complaining about it. He's breaking. I have to make this goat
[2112.41s -> 2114.41s]  No, you motherfucker
[2124.17s -> 2126.17s]  Goldilocks into three bears
[2127.30s -> 2133.96s]  An unrealistic story if you break into a bear's house in the woods, you're going to get maimed
[2135.94s -> 2137.94s]  This porch let me try it
[2140.18s -> 2141.88s]  This porch
[2141.88s -> 2148.44s]  It's a little it's a little too cold for me. Well, who's house am I in this? Let me try this one
[2150.60s -> 2155.32s]  Oh now two. What's that sound outside? Oh, it's a little too cold for me
[2156.12s -> 2158.12s]  Who's that?
[2158.12s -> 2160.12s]  What is that?
[2161.70s -> 2163.06s]  Is it
[2163.06s -> 2165.06s]  No, no, this one's too cold
[2165.38s -> 2166.50s]  Please go
[2166.50s -> 2169.38s]  Oh
[2169.38s -> 2185.69s]  That's what happens. Derma. It's a story for kids
[2202.76s -> 2211.53s]  Somebody said nice family guy bit. Does that happen? Don't make me laugh right now. Does that happen in family guy?
[2211.53s -> 2212.73s]  It probably does
[2212.73s -> 2216.97s]  It definitely does that have that that absolutely happens in family guy your app you 100 correct
[2217.61s -> 2219.61s]  It has to there's no way it doesn't
[2221.02s -> 2236.57s]  Okay, jerma, please
[2236.57s -> 2238.73s]  Pay me for your fursuit commission
[2241.27s -> 2245.67s]  How many times am I gonna mad before I quit today? Uh, the goal is to just try to win
[2246.55s -> 2248.55s]  All right. I listen to me. I have
[2249.11s -> 2252.04s]  Let me see
[2252.04s -> 2256.78s]  Somebody got it. Let's see
[2259.72s -> 2263.56s]  How's your oatmeal honey, you know, it tastes kind of different than usual
[2265.40s -> 2274.74s]  Oh my god, that's not the same
[2274.98s -> 2277.62s]  That is actually not the same joke that's a
[2278.10s -> 2281.94s]  I was doing a goldilocks routine. Well, that was a routine of like waiter
[2281.94s -> 2284.74s]  There's a fly in my soup except it's a bear. Look at how big a bear is
[2284.74s -> 2287.30s]  How would you not see there was a bear in your soup? I didn't that's not what I did
[2288.89s -> 2292.49s]  That was the same sound effect because every sound effect is the same sound effect for a bear
[2293.94s -> 2301.21s]  You ever try to record a bear in the wild before of course, there's only one clip that exists everybody else is dead
[2302.20s -> 2305.16s]  The one guy that got it close enough and then could run away
[2307.83s -> 2309.83s]  All right. Do we have a guaranteed way to get through this?
[2315.18s -> 2318.60s]  there has to be
[2318.60s -> 2320.60s]  all the way to the right and then
[2323.19s -> 2324.71s]  That's not bad
[2324.71s -> 2328.42s]  Like give me the fuck up here. Let's go
[2329.35s -> 2330.55s]  boys and girls
[2330.55s -> 2332.07s]  Can we please?
[2332.07s -> 2339.08s]  I'm in the law. I'm in for the long haul tonight. So those of you that are like, oh man, this guy sucks. This guy sucks
[2339.88s -> 2343.24s]  Holy shit, this guy sucks. He fell down to the sewer again. This guy sucks
[2343.88s -> 2347.96s]  Dude, he fell down to the sewer again. He was up the snow. Oh, this guy scott. This guy sucks
[2349.80s -> 2351.80s]  It's all right. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here
[2352.84s -> 2393.51s]  This guy's pretty good
[2393.51s -> 2395.75s]  No, don't didn't you get the word sky sucks?
[2398.78s -> 2401.82s]  Damn it. That's what I if you miss it. You have to I think go to the other side
[2408.44s -> 2418.17s]  You gotta hit it. No, I was trying to get a good spot up here
[2421.82s -> 2423.94s]  Shit
[2423.94s -> 2426.50s]  I wonder is it a better idea to just go from here?
[2427.22s -> 2429.22s]  I don't think so. I'll hit my head, right?
[2434.01s -> 2441.11s]  I'll hit my head. Can you get up there?
[2441.43s -> 2443.96s]  Get up there
[2443.96s -> 2447.40s]  Streamer, please stop this fall joke. It's not funny anymore. It's always funny
[2448.04s -> 2460.95s]  I'm trying to hit it from the back. It's hard to do
[2463.43s -> 2466.46s]  Because once you get up there
[2466.46s -> 2468.46s]  You really have to get it from this way
[2474.66s -> 2475.70s]  Too much
[2475.70s -> 2485.19s]  What are you guys spamming? Hey, is this yesterday's vod?
[2486.49s -> 2490.23s]  uh
[2490.23s -> 2492.23s]  Sorry, it got replaced with this
[2492.79s -> 2511.85s]  Okay, let's go
[2512.82s -> 2514.82s]  Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah
[2522.50s -> 2532.33s]  I know I can get on here from here, but it's got to be so precise. No, I am using dpad now though
[2532.41s -> 2536.44s]  So i've gotten used to it
[2536.44s -> 2538.44s]  This is the commentary. I you know what?
[2539.00s -> 2544.87s]  I've got hey, let's put on the vod from yesterday's audio
[2546.44s -> 2553.98s]  And see if it matches up
[2553.98s -> 2555.10s]  I wonder
[2555.10s -> 2559.50s]  Let's see. I'm gonna get it to a point where it was right here and we'll see if it matches up with what happens on the
[2559.50s -> 2560.54s]  screen
[2560.54s -> 2564.55s]  Enjoy the stream
[2564.55s -> 2567.75s]  Enjoy the pre-recorded live stream
[2568.39s -> 2576.66s]  Slow down now. I gotta go from here to there
[2579.59s -> 2584.25s]  Holy shit, I fell down so many times. All right. Hold on. Here we are
[2584.98s -> 2586.98s]  I'm going to let's make this a little louder
[2587.70s -> 2589.70s]  And i'm gonna mute all sounds in this game
[2594.54s -> 2597.08s]  Why was that so loud?
[2597.08s -> 2603.67s]  Ow my fucking ear. Why is the window sound louder than everything else? It doesn't make any sense
[2604.39s -> 2612.09s]  Okay, so i'm back. No, no, no, no
[2612.73s -> 2614.73s]  I am now standing in the
[2615.05s -> 2620.09s]  This is at if you want to play along this is at four hours 36 minutes and 37 seconds from last night
[2620.09s -> 2622.09s]  I'm standing in the exact same spot
[2624.33s -> 2626.18s]  Okay
[2626.18s -> 2627.06s]  Ready?
[2627.06s -> 2674.15s]  Let's go
[2674.15s -> 2700.95s]  Oh, yeah. Yeah, I just want to get back to where I was. Why did that happen? It's not about destination. It's about the journey
[2706.04s -> 2713.43s]  Now it's about the destination at this point. It's about the destination. I want to get there
[2714.30s -> 2717.82s]  It's about getting there about getting to the top. That's that's what it is
[2718.78s -> 2720.71s]  That's about
[2720.71s -> 2726.09s]  The oh really so i'm driving we're driving across a country trip to go to like disneyworld
[2728.50s -> 2733.30s]  And I got four kids screaming in the back singing songs while I got everyone's yelling and I
[2734.34s -> 2738.34s]  My wife's in the passenger seat with a map in her hands going like I don't think you went the wrong
[2738.42s -> 2740.66s]  I think you went the wrong way. I didn't go the wrong way
[2746.44s -> 2756.98s]  No, you want to get to disneyworld fuck the car ride to disneyworld. You want to get to disneyworld and go see goofy?
[2792.95s -> 2796.86s]  Uh
[2796.94s -> 2798.66s]  Get the coin
[2798.66s -> 2801.30s]  Don't get the coin. Don't get the coin. Don't get the coin
[2801.86s -> 2804.42s]  Don't get the coin. It's death. It's guaranteed to lose
[2804.74s -> 2809.14s]  You're guaranteed to lose if you get that coin in this wind now mean game developer. I told you
[2812.47s -> 2816.23s]  I got the coin. I got the coin. I got the coin. I got the coin. I got the coin. Okay coin got it
[2825.21s -> 2829.13s]  I have to wait was I not even muted? I've just been laughing
[2832.12s -> 2834.12s]  I've been sitting here going
[2834.28s -> 2837.35s]  He
[2839.27s -> 2847.67s]  So why is there someone just breathing on this vod why is somebody just breathing whose breath is that who's in the who's doing this
[2859.69s -> 2861.69s]  Got the coin got the coin
[2862.01s -> 2865.85s]  Dermot, can you play this during the next stream?
[2869.37s -> 2873.70s]  No, there's not going to be a next stream of this game. I don't think
[2881.05s -> 2882.09s]  Got it
[2882.09s -> 2884.09s]  All right. We've made it to the snow part
[2885.83s -> 2887.83s]  He'll never make any progress
[2889.13s -> 2891.13s]  This is not even progress
[2894.15s -> 2898.39s]  You should take a nap and come back and play this game guys. I slept six. I slept like
[2899.19s -> 2901.43s]  14 hours last night. I think i'm gonna be okay

[4816.14s -> 4817.82s]  like that and then
[4817.82s -> 4826.34s]  I think I have to get on that one on the left from here. I think I can go over there
[4827.30s -> 4829.30s]  Aye. Aye. Aye. I think I can though
[4842.04s -> 4848.36s]  With honestly, there's nothing like watching german loses mind while I lose my my mind hatching shinies
[4857.43s -> 4859.91s]  I'm not getting the boots. I'm not going back down to the sewer
[4861.13s -> 4863.13s]  Guys, I'm not I can't do that
[4863.69s -> 4867.61s]  I'm sorry. That's some other streamer. That's better than me. We'll figure it out
[4868.65s -> 4871.37s]  That ain't gonna be me. I'm not gonna go get the boots
[4874.66s -> 4876.66s]  If I go down and get those boots
[4877.30s -> 4880.58s]  What if I open them up again? I'm sorry. I can't
[4882.50s -> 4885.13s]  How much space is on these?
[4894.06s -> 4905.99s]  Shit. Okay. What's up here? Oh, yeah. Um
[4906.87s -> 4912.98s]  Can I make it from here?
[4912.98s -> 4915.32s]  Oh, I can
[4915.32s -> 4916.74s]  now
[4916.74s -> 4921.35s]  Oh, um
[4921.51s -> 4928.95s]  and
[4928.95s -> 4930.55s]  Get out of town
[4930.55s -> 4954.22s]  What what is it? Can I oh there's a slot? Okay. I thought that was part of the background
[4957.54s -> 4960.82s]  It's not the boots. I thought it was for a second. I was about to be really really really deflated
[4961.62s -> 4968.31s]  Okay, um
[4968.31s -> 4970.79s]  I have to get to the left ledge very obvious
[4975.78s -> 4979.30s]  So what go from jump from here to the right and then from right to left?
[4980.02s -> 4986.22s]  Could I go to the right? Yeah, I can't how do I can't get up to I have to jump from that left platform to the chandelier
[4991.03s -> 4996.47s]  So can I do this?
[4996.63s -> 4998.63s]  Look at this dude. It seems like a new man
[5008.22s -> 5014.78s]  What is up here? What is that? Wait, hold on. I'm I'm I've almost got it. I've almost got it
[5019.80s -> 5022.60s]  No, no, no, no, no, that's all right. Sorry. Sorry. I almost just just relax
[5056.49s -> 5059.61s]  You gotta you gotta you gotta go off the edge. You gotta go. You gotta go full off the edge
[5059.69s -> 5071.51s]  I got it. Watch this shit. Ah
[5072.97s -> 5078.55s]  Look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the wait. Look at the wait. Look at the wait
[5078.79s -> 5094.06s]  How do I get up there? Um that that falls all the way down that falls all the way down
[5094.14s -> 5101.74s]  That falls all the way down. Can I stand on that? No, I can't I can't stand on that
[5102.06s -> 5107.72s]  Do I have to fall bounce off the edge on the left side?
[5109.43s -> 5112.55s]  Or do I throw my face into the right side and bounce over to the left?
[5113.11s -> 5120.76s]  Can I stand on that ledge? I think it'll it'll don't it's gonna dump me
[5126.07s -> 5128.63s]  Yeah, okay. Okay. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep
[5128.71s -> 5130.71s]  It's a you bounce off the edge, but not a full bounce
[5131.27s -> 5133.67s]  And I might be in a little bit of trouble here. No, i'm not check this out
[5134.31s -> 5140.39s]  a little bit trouble
[5141.91s -> 5148.31s]  So you got to bounce off the left not a full bounce shit fuck. Oh damn it. Ah
[5149.03s -> 5152.17s]  Fuck because i'm so I think I can still get over this
[5157.02s -> 5159.02s]  No, i'm sorry. I'm sorry. Yeah
[5159.50s -> 5161.50s]  Look, you gotta you gotta fall down first
[5161.98s -> 5164.78s]  How am I supposed to know how to do that jump at the end now I got it
[5164.78s -> 5166.78s]  I'll get now just take this takes a little bit of time
[5167.66s -> 5173.94s]  It just takes a little bit of time guys. It takes time. Whatever you sounded like my grandma for a second
[5188.55s -> 5190.55s]  You actually want to bounce off that? Okay
[5199.72s -> 5204.68s]  All right. I'm I swear to god like my heart is still racing
[5205.16s -> 5208.44s]  From the highway to hell portion like it's slop slow down
[5209.08s -> 5227.62s]  Okay, then we go from here up to there
[5228.42s -> 5242.04s]  All right this way
[5256.26s -> 5278.22s]  All right now we're up we're up we're up we're up I he oh
[5280.09s -> 5284.33s]  Oh, whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. There's an ice level in the game. How should I get? Um,
[5285.98s -> 5290.58s]  There's ice here. There's ice in the game. There's ice here. Can I go?
[5291.54s -> 5296.73s]  Can I go all the way to the right?
[5296.73s -> 5302.57s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, this is not fun. This is not fun. This is not a fun part
[5303.34s -> 5304.52s]  What?
[5304.52s -> 5307.08s]  There's a slide now you slide
[5307.64s -> 5310.36s]  There's a slide. I can't believe they put a slide here. That's unbelievable
[5311.16s -> 5313.16s]  No way
[5313.16s -> 5320.57s]  Go for just do it. Go for it. Just don't slide too far. You got to be kidding me. That's difficult
[5321.13s -> 5332.10s]  Difficult difficult
[5332.10s -> 5335.22s]  Oh, yeah. Okay. Okay fun
[5335.86s -> 5340.02s]  Yeah, nice. Cool. Good. Yeah, you dump all the way down here. Cool
[5340.66s -> 5346.84s]  They're not gonna make it easy are they?
[5346.84s -> 5349.80s]  dick
[5349.80s -> 5351.80s]  Goddamn fucking ice level
[5364.94s -> 5367.26s]  I'll tell you though that actually sucks absolute ass
[5368.52s -> 5370.52s]  Oh that sucks ass
[5375.66s -> 5377.66s]  Yeah, hold this sucks ass
[5390.30s -> 5393.34s]  I think we're gonna put an ice level in a game that has precision jumping in it
[5395.54s -> 5407.14s]  What's wrong with this guy?
[5407.14s -> 5409.14s]  What guy? I don't know the guy that made the game
[5409.46s -> 5419.46s]  Whoever made this game. What's wrong with you? Why did you do this?
[5434.06s -> 5435.74s]  I'm sorry
[5435.74s -> 5456.12s]  You didn't make this
[5456.12s -> 5461.54s]  Fuck i'm stuck now. Maybe I can
[5462.10s -> 5470.71s]  He made it to the chapel. I made it to the the second screen of the
[5471.43s -> 5473.67s]  We put slippery ice level in video game
[5476.52s -> 5479.40s]  You I've words cannot even describe how angry I am about that scenario
[5488.73s -> 5505.98s]  Get in there. Let's go. Get up. I'm just so happy. I don't have to see the sewer anymore ever again
[5508.79s -> 5511.67s]  Congrats jerma. That was officially your hundred thousandth swear
[5512.90s -> 5514.76s]  Really?
[5514.76s -> 5536.71s]  I'm honored
[5539.59s -> 5565.38s]  All right, wipe the hands too much too much. Ow
[5568.70s -> 5603.62s]  I hate this part sucks
[5604.42s -> 5612.12s]  Uh jerma little do you know this is the sewer now
[5626.47s -> 5654.70s]  It's just been replaced. Don't fuck this up. I'm gonna hit this now, dude. What are you doing?
[5657.56s -> 5678.87s]  Oh my god
[5679.83s -> 5681.83s]  Fucking this stupid jump
[5683.53s -> 5696.26s]  This it's it's it's only one pixel way to do this. Fuck this part too. All right, slow down
[5731.26s -> 5751.38s]  Hey to the right to the right, huh? Now what now what now? What do I do? Uh, do I have to?
[5753.77s -> 5765.19s]  Jump over that and I have to hit the slide unless i'm insane that this was springboards or anything, right?
[5767.38s -> 5769.38s]  So you hit slide
[5769.38s -> 5771.38s]  And then rip to the right
[5771.38s -> 5784.14s]  Like hold right how much momentum do you get from sliding down a slide or do I have to jump?
[5786.25s -> 5790.04s]  Let's go
[5790.04s -> 5794.12s]  Oh, I did it. I did it. I did it. I did it. I actually did I actually did it. I actually did it
[5794.12s -> 5796.12s]  I actually did it. I actually did it. I actually did it
[5796.68s -> 5798.28s]  Okay, I don't think i'll ever be able to do that ever again
[5798.28s -> 5801.64s]  I have to beat it now. I have to be after I beat this part right now. I'll never do this again
[5804.86s -> 5807.58s]  I will never do what I just did ever again at certain
[5809.16s -> 5813.38s]  How do I?
[5815.22s -> 5845.08s]  You have to baby jump to kill momentum
[5845.56s -> 5850.04s]  Hold so it got hold a let go of a hold a let oh that sucks
[5865.90s -> 5868.58s]  Do it with the boots. I
[5869.06s -> 5871.06s]  Do I actually have to go get the boots?
[5874.49s -> 5886.20s]  No, I don't I don't it's so far down. It's gonna be way easier if I get the boots
[5887.74s -> 5889.74s]  Yeah, but I mean
[5889.74s -> 5891.74s]  But then I might i'm gonna go back down to the sewer
[5896.39s -> 5900.71s]  No, there's 100 no way i'm going to get the boots. I have to do it without the boots
[5903.62s -> 5906.26s]  Uh, I will it'll be a coin scenario
[5907.69s -> 5909.69s]  Do you know how long it will take me to come back up here?
[5909.69s -> 5911.93s]  It'll take me probably eight hours to get back up to the chapel
[5912.49s -> 5914.49s]  Uh, i'm not getting the boots
[5915.21s -> 5918.25s]  I don't care if it saves me four hours tonight. No way
[5918.89s -> 5920.17s]  Not gonna happen
[5927.78s -> 5931.94s]  Think of all the work you did getting the coin. Yeah, but that was just for like if you guys think I was cool
[5932.58s -> 5935.91s]  No, I don't doesn't matter. Whatever
[5955.75s -> 5957.43s]  Why am I doing it like this?
[5957.43s -> 5961.83s]  There's a very easy solution to this. I don't know why i'm not doing it like this. What the hell am I doing?
[5963.64s -> 5967.64s]  There's a 30 there's a 30 000 times faster way to do what i'm doing
[5968.73s -> 5971.98s]  Watch this
[5971.98s -> 5973.90s]  Like why am I doing it like this?
[5973.90s -> 5979.10s]  When I should just be doing it like this
[5979.10s -> 5981.10s]  Just get up get up here
[5982.02s -> 5984.60s]  And then just jump off the wall
[5984.60s -> 5988.73s]  Like why do I care so much about this part like watch already watch this
[5990.57s -> 5998.28s]  I mean i've had it
[5998.28s -> 6000.60s]  I mean, it's definitely easier. Yes, it is
[6006.36s -> 6007.80s]  It was two
[6007.80s -> 6016.12s]  That that seriously sucks such asshole. It's like so bad
[6016.92s -> 6021.96s]  Why have that there? It's so stupid. It's stupid
[6022.84s -> 6024.84s]  It's stupid
[6030.10s -> 6036.02s]  You either walk off the cliff or find the two one pixel where you can jump to the left and hit your head on the ceiling
[6036.42s -> 6044.30s]  To bounce to the right
[6044.30s -> 6062.62s]  You need the boots. I don't need the boots. I don't need the damn boots
[6087.11s -> 6094.23s]  Get it. Ah
[6094.23s -> 6097.91s]  Why are you so scared of the sewer? Because I did you did you watch the stream yesterday?
[6098.55s -> 6101.64s]  You may not have the stream yesterday was about seven hours
[6102.28s -> 6104.44s]  Four or five of those hours were in the sewer
[6107.30s -> 6110.42s]  I'm I don't want to do that again. I don't ever want to see that screen for the rest of my life
[6111.14s -> 6117.66s]  I don't want to see that screen
[6117.98s -> 6164.02s]  Never again
[6164.02s -> 6169.51s]  I am not all right. I am not going to go down
[6170.44s -> 6174.78s]  15 screens to get the boots to make it easier. I just have to do it
[6175.26s -> 6180.47s]  I just have to do the ice level without the boots. I am full stop
[6181.29s -> 6187.29s]  Not going to go get the boots. I am not going to go get the boots
[6187.77s -> 6190.81s]  I will not go get the boots
[6191.45s -> 6197.74s]  I will not go get the boots. I will not go get the boots
[6198.38s -> 6201.10s]  I will not go get the boots
[6201.58s -> 6212.78s]  Okay, does it have to be any more clear than that? I'm not going to go get the boots
[6223.51s -> 6228.89s]  Jerm, I think you should go get the boots. Should I what do you think? What do you think I should do?
[6228.97s -> 6262.98s]  What do you guys think I should do? I what what what are you guys? What's what's the plan? What's the plan? Huh boots?
[6266.36s -> 6297.86s]  He's doing a poll. No, I was just checking the time with my clock app. Do not get the boots
[6297.86s -> 6304.87s]  It's bait even if it's not i'm not going i'm gonna i'm gonna do it on hard mode
[6305.11s -> 6308.87s]  If the boots make you not slip on the ice, well, then whoop the goddamn do
[6309.99s -> 6315.75s]  I didn't get them and I have to deal with my consequences of completing the ice level without the ice boots
[6317.67s -> 6321.99s]  I think that's bait. It's definitely bait. I'm being baited
[6322.79s -> 6352.62s]  But i'll all right. All right
[6352.70s -> 6372.31s]  Damn boots get the boots. It's gonna be hard to judge this. It's from all the way to the back
[6374.06s -> 6376.06s]  Oh, fuck. I need christmas music
[6376.30s -> 6378.30s]  You guys are making my blood pressure go up
[6379.34s -> 6392.14s]  I think it has to be
[6392.86s -> 6399.50s]  A full jump to the right i'll hit my head here
[6400.22s -> 6403.37s]  I know my head
[6403.37s -> 6406.25s]  Is not a full jump but it has to be full jump height
[6407.29s -> 6409.29s]  Fuck you beeper get out of here
[6410.44s -> 6413.16s]  Is it full right? I don't think it's full right i'll go over the whole thing
[6413.88s -> 6437.93s]  I'll hide it. Let me hold on you go. I don't think I can even make that jump
[6439.53s -> 6441.53s]  That's no i'm gonna hit the wall
[6442.01s -> 6446.31s]  Do I have to hit my face off the edge here? Just do like a boom to the left?
[6447.03s -> 6454.60s]  Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute
[6455.64s -> 6457.64s]  If I jump over to the left
[6458.20s -> 6463.08s]  And then slide and slide up the whole thing and go to the right will I just go up to shoot?
[6474.25s -> 6477.37s]  Or is it a full left into here and bounce my head off this
[6487.45s -> 6489.61s]  Do it full right
[6489.61s -> 6493.29s]  Full right, but I think a full right from the middle from like right here
[6493.53s -> 6496.57s]  I'm scared to do a full right from here. I think i'm gonna soar over the whole thing
[6507.18s -> 6512.86s]  It's too much not full right it's too much too much that's way too much
[6514.17s -> 6543.13s]  All right. I know for next time. I gotta get back into this way. It doesn't you should have gotten the boots
[6546.36s -> 6550.20s]  I'm gonna start i'm gonna start just fucking banning people
[6550.84s -> 6553.88s]  You want me to start the bans? I'll bring it on
[6554.44s -> 6563.91s]  Oh, I will drop a nuke
[6564.60s -> 6566.71s]  That's big
[6566.71s -> 6572.87s]  As at least two or three of those firecracker things that you get from the gas station that you throw on the ground and they just pop
[6574.15s -> 6595.05s]  Don't make me do that. I like this part. I really like this part
[6596.10s -> 6614.57s]  It's the only part of the whole game that I actually like probably. All right, let's go
[6630.97s -> 6632.97s]  Buh buh buh buh boots
[6641.69s -> 6643.69s]  You guys are killing me here
[6658.60s -> 6664.39s]  All right, I got sweaty hands I gotta my hands are sweating you could have beaten the game by now with boots
[6668.01s -> 6672.99s]  You I you guys sincerely are overestimating my capability to get back to the cathedral
[6675.74s -> 6679.26s]  I'm never coming back here again. If I go 15 screens down
[6684.30s -> 6689.10s]  I'll never be back here again. It's gonna be easy if you have boots
[6709.72s -> 6736.15s]  Uh, don't fall for it. I don't know what to believe. I I thought you guys were making jokes
[6736.95s -> 6743.11s]  I'm gonna go down there and he's gonna go. Oh, sorry. Somebody already bought those boots guaranteed it, right?
[6743.11s -> 6745.67s]  That's the whole joke that the game wants to play on me
[6746.55s -> 6750.23s]  Sorry, I just ran out of stock. Somebody else bought them. I know it's gonna happen
[6758.10s -> 6760.90s]  I've played video games before i'm gonna get baited
[6761.54s -> 6766.34s]  First of all, let me get back up to the ice level
[6766.82s -> 6774.73s]  Just relax the music for a little bit before I start banning people
[6775.21s -> 6794.54s]  You think you think i'm bluffing people think i'm bluffing
[6795.34s -> 6810.33s]  You think i'm bluffing mocha is he bluffing mocha? Yeah. Yeah, i'm bluffing
[6810.81s -> 6816.50s]  Why would I ban somebody?
[6816.50s -> 6820.50s]  For repeating the same sentence over and over again trying to mauled me
[6821.38s -> 6824.20s]  I know what your intentions are
[6864.57s -> 6897.19s]  Ah, I got up to the first one. I just did I have I never tried that on the jump before
[6897.91s -> 6906.31s]  I got up. It's a full it by the way, it is a full right jump to get to that first one
[6907.86s -> 6919.56s]  Now the second one that's another story. I have no idea that first jump is all the way to the right, okay
[6962.07s -> 6965.03s]  It's definitely possible I just got to concentrate without any
[6965.83s -> 6967.35s]  boots
[6967.35s -> 6980.04s]  Chairman, please do whatever you think is best. Hey, thanks. I appreciate that
[6981.48s -> 6983.48s]  Hey, thank you
[6983.80s -> 7016.58s]  I gotta go a little further than that
[7016.58s -> 7022.87s]  So it's all right, but is there a is there a shortcut right there?
[7025.35s -> 7032.63s]  Can I jump straight into that? Here's the real question. This is the hard jump right here
[7033.51s -> 7035.51s]  This is the one because look at that ceiling
[7035.90s -> 7037.74s]  Never i've only tried this once
[7037.74s -> 7047.24s]  It's okay. All right, so that that's correct, but just a little bit less than that a hair less
[7047.80s -> 7093.56s]  Ah, hmm
[7104.10s -> 7106.10s]  Walk up the slope funny face
[7106.82s -> 7107.78s]  Ah
[7107.78s -> 7110.97s]  What about that right side?
[7110.97s -> 7113.13s]  Is that a spot or is that an incline?
[7116.89s -> 7120.15s]  Is that a spot to stand?
[7120.15s -> 7121.51s]  Or is that a troll?
[7121.51s -> 7130.09s]  That's an incline. Okay
[7130.17s -> 7132.73s]  There are two ways I could I see this playing out
[7133.45s -> 7134.97s]  way number one
[7134.97s -> 7139.45s]  Try to jump on top of that way number two jump to the all the way
[7143.93s -> 7145.93s]  Or jump to the middle one
[7149.72s -> 7152.28s]  Three go get the boots
[7153.86s -> 7161.42s]  What is it what I want to do?
[7162.06s -> 7164.55s]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha
[7171.05s -> 7172.89s]  Now what do I do
[7172.89s -> 7174.33s]  Now, what do I do?
[7174.33s -> 7176.57s]  I don't think I can make this I have to bounce
[7177.21s -> 7178.41s]  off of that
[7178.41s -> 7180.41s]  Onto that platform on the left
[7181.67s -> 7185.35s]  I have to bounce my face over to the right and hit it and then bounce to the left
[7186.52s -> 7188.52s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. What do you mean? No
[7189.16s -> 7191.48s]  No, what do you mean? No, what do you mean? No, what are you talking about? No
[7192.36s -> 7193.24s]  No
[7193.24s -> 7195.62s]  Jump bounce left
[7195.62s -> 7198.18s]  Jump all the way to left bounce off land on the platform, right?
[7198.90s -> 7200.90s]  That angle is not possible. No, that angle is not possible
[7205.32s -> 7208.52s]  This is no, this is an impossible angle. I can't jump from here. I'm gonna hit the slope
[7223.93s -> 7225.53s]  You're gonna slide
[7225.53s -> 7227.53s]  Yeah, i'll slide down won't I?
[7227.93s -> 7232.22s]  I think i'm going full left
[7233.11s -> 7244.38s]  or fall
[7244.38s -> 7250.30s]  That's not no. No, I can't fucking believe people actually told me to slide up the platform. Oh my god
[7250.38s -> 7252.38s]  You people are killing me
[7252.70s -> 7258.06s]  Slide up the platform your god. Yeah, it was such bullshit. That was just an absolute crock of dog
[7258.14s -> 7259.18s]  Okay
[7259.18s -> 7331.59s]  That doesn't work either drop jumping up normally doesn't work jumping to the right doesn't work to bounce jumping to the left is the only option
[7332.15s -> 7341.74s]  That's it. No, that's it. That's correct. That's correct. Now you can small you can small jump you can small jump
[7341.82s -> 7346.30s]  Oh my god, fuck this game
[7346.30s -> 7348.30s]  You can I have you have to be
[7348.62s -> 7349.82s]  Yo
[7349.82s -> 7350.94s]  Yo
[7350.94s -> 7356.39s]  Yo, you really like okay, you can do that. But holy shit
[7364.41s -> 7366.41s]  Oh, I gotta calm down here
[7366.49s -> 7368.49s]  You got I go get the boots
[7368.65s -> 7373.93s]  I'm so close to getting through that without them that I can just memorize that ice level soon
[7393.80s -> 7396.04s]  I do I have improved at that part
[7396.98s -> 7399.48s]  I have
[7399.48s -> 7401.64s]  Remember before how fucked up that was
[7402.44s -> 7440.12s]  I was reliably making those jumps. It's okay settle down settle down settle down. It's okay
[7446.81s -> 7459.58s]  I'm sweaty
[7459.58s -> 7472.39s]  Settle down settle down settle down settle down
[7473.27s -> 7488.70s]  It's a little longer than that
[7488.70s -> 7491.66s]  Settle down settle down settle down settle down settle down settle down
[7492.54s -> 7494.14s]  Fuck
[7494.14s -> 7496.14s]  Oh my fucking god
[7497.56s -> 7502.68s]  I have it too. I have it just dumps you so far down here. This is the new sewer
[7503.56s -> 7506.68s]  It just throws you all the fucking way down
[7507.40s -> 7512.90s]  I was in a groove there, too
[7512.98s -> 7543.38s]  Does german know there are boots?
[7545.67s -> 7547.67s]  Jesus fucking christ
[7562.18s -> 7564.66s]  I'm almost above the ice part
[7566.62s -> 7568.62s]  That was not the dev
[7568.62s -> 7589.51s]  I'm sorry, you're sending too many boot related messages per minute
[7589.91s -> 7618.04s]  Please wait for a 10 second cooldown to repeat your boot meme. I'm angry. All right. I'm turning off chat
[7618.52s -> 7638.14s]  I'll see you guys in an hour. Somebody gave five. I don't know who it was though
[7638.14s -> 7641.66s]  I don't have my chat turned on somebody gave five. Oh, who could it be? My chat's not on
[7641.98s -> 7654.36s]  Thank you. Germa sucks for the five community subs. Appreciate that
[7655.83s -> 7657.59s]  Hey have a
[7657.67s -> 7673.56s]  Great day
[7673.56s -> 7677.48s]  Just get over here. Don't even try to make this just get up there
[7678.54s -> 7682.62s]  Just get up it don't even try to make the jump from here. It's the dumbest thing to do
[7683.50s -> 7685.50s]  Just get on the damn thing
[7689.74s -> 7707.46s]  Wipe the hands. What do I do if somebody gives me boots for christmas?
[7708.79s -> 7710.79s]  I will put them. I will blend them
[7732.44s -> 7735.00s]  Oh fuck didn't have to go that far. I hit the ceiling
[7735.64s -> 7743.38s]  Too far. Oh god. Damn it
[7744.26s -> 7750.18s]  God damn it. God damn it. God damn it. God damn it. God damn it. God damn it
[7750.58s -> 7765.99s]  God damn it. I'm gonna wake up god
[7772.84s -> 7774.84s]  Stop saying that my cat is sleeping
[7776.92s -> 7779.96s]  Why do you have your why you why do you have your cat lying next to your speakers?
[7786.22s -> 7794.52s]  Where is your cat?
[7794.52s -> 7796.52s]  He chose to be there
[7797.08s -> 7799.56s]  Well, then turn my turn me down
[7800.36s -> 7815.21s]  I'm not gonna get i'm not gonna let it happen
[7815.21s -> 7819.21s]  I'm not gonna get pressured into getting the boots and getting stuck under sewer again all stream. No
[7821.69s -> 7824.89s]  I'm almost through the ice. It's just hard. I ain't gonna let that happen
[7831.59s -> 7837.67s]  No, I've made my decision. This is not a I don't care if this takes me the next 12 straight hours
[7838.39s -> 7841.67s]  To get up this ice. I'm not going to get the boots. It'll never happen
[7842.63s -> 7847.75s]  You're you're wasting your internet data. You're wasting your bandwidth by writing the word boot
[7848.39s -> 7850.17s]  I'm just telling you the truth
[7850.17s -> 7853.93s]  Just you're wasting data you're using data right now that it doesn't it's not gonna do anything for you
[7854.49s -> 7860.10s]  It's i'm not going to get them
[7860.10s -> 7887.38s]  You're wasting data. Yeah, good. I I I hope I hope you guys writing boots right now
[7887.38s -> 7891.93s]  I hope like you get a you ding on your phone and you look at it. You're like, what's that?
[7892.33s -> 7906.47s]  Oh, sorry, you've gone over in your data this month and you go. Oh shit
[7907.19s -> 7909.99s]  Probably should stop writing boots a hundred times in a row
[7920.39s -> 7923.99s]  What is this chat? Okay, I gotta calm down you guys
[7927.03s -> 7929.59s]  I have unlimited data
[7930.07s -> 7932.07s]  There's no such thing as unlimited anything
[7936.10s -> 7938.10s]  All re everything is finite
[7988.82s -> 7999.05s]  All right
[7999.05s -> 8042.38s]  It's a little too much
[8045.69s -> 8048.44s]  Where do I go from here to the right?
[8050.34s -> 8052.34s]  Can I make this fucking jump from here?
[8052.50s -> 8097.66s]  I'm gonna hit my head on the ceiling. I missed that I hit I held it the whole time
[8115.67s -> 8124.79s]  All the way down again
[8124.79s -> 8131.00s]  Back to back to sewer two
[8131.00s -> 8135.32s]  Now I don't want to hear anybody say the word boots because I got past the section that I required the boots for
[8135.80s -> 8138.50s]  I just have to get through it. What do you boots?
[8139.30s -> 8142.82s]  I I beat the section that the boots are required for
[8145.64s -> 8150.28s]  I just beat it. I just beat that section now. You can't say that anymore
[8155.77s -> 8157.53s]  I I win
[8157.53s -> 8169.05s]  I win
[8169.13s -> 8173.61s]  Can we can we like I'm I don't want to get all Vince McMahon on you on everybody. Like can we relax?
[8178.47s -> 8187.46s]  All right, I got it. Yeah, i'm covered in grease
[8188.34s -> 8193.16s]  Yeah
[8193.16s -> 8195.16s]  It's all right. It's two hours. You know what that means
[8195.88s -> 8203.02s]  Covered in grease my whole body i'm gonna start streaming from the inside of a fucking refrigerator
[8205.08s -> 8209.00s]  That would probably be better if I was in like a a negative 12 degree room
[8209.72s -> 8215.86s]  That would probably be better
[8215.86s -> 8218.10s]  My body temperature right now is probably 150
[8219.24s -> 8221.24s]  I should i'm legally dead right now
[8221.64s -> 8223.66s]  How I don't understand?
[8223.66s -> 8244.33s]  Why does this happen?
[8244.33s -> 8248.49s]  Dude, these jumps are worse than anything else. I'll can I just have the snow level back, please?
[8255.74s -> 8289.61s]  That's where I belong. It's relaxed. I really am aquaman god
[8299.24s -> 8301.00s]  liquid handicap
[8301.00s -> 8303.00s]  times five water on body
[8314.84s -> 8316.84s]  Life is pain
[8317.16s -> 8339.37s]  No, that's not what I wanted to fuck over here
[8341.77s -> 8345.37s]  I went to get a snack earlier. Thank you for staying in the church section. You're very you're welcome
[8346.49s -> 8350.33s]  I went too hard again
[8351.85s -> 8354.41s]  It's like it's so hard to judge when you're bouncing
[8354.97s -> 8378.55s]  When you bounce it into a wall it's hard to judge you slow down calm down why is this in the game?
[8381.27s -> 8394.31s]  I'm about to go make some mac and cheese. Do you mind getting those boots while i'm gone?
[8396.94s -> 8398.94s]  All right, okay
[8421.27s -> 8426.15s]  Stop if you if I fall I just need to I just gotta you know, I mean you panic
[8426.95s -> 8437.37s]  Because you know, you're gonna be skidding what happened there
[8439.06s -> 8442.34s]  I did a full jump. That's that's worked every single time
[8443.06s -> 8449.56s]  I did a full jump. What the fuck happened? I did a full jump. That's happened. That's worked every time
[8450.44s -> 8452.44s]  Come on, man. What?
[8452.60s -> 8457.80s]  That's worked every single time
[8457.80s -> 8459.80s]  Don't worry. That's not fucking aggravating
[8460.36s -> 8462.46s]  No
[8462.46s -> 8468.54s]  Sorry, I forgot i'm playing aggravation simulator. Just rename it just do it. What's what why I call this jump king
[8469.10s -> 8482.15s]  Like just rename this game
[8482.15s -> 8486.95s]  I'm trying to piss you off. That's it. Just that's what it's that's true. That's what it should be called
[8489.53s -> 8491.37s]  This is not about jumping
[8491.37s -> 8494.97s]  It's about trying to make as many and many people angry as possible
[8503.53s -> 8506.01s]  I think this shit was in an episode of dexter's lab one time
[8506.57s -> 8511.53s]  There was like an evil guy that like didn't want to make everybody like sad or like angry and gave them like a video game
[8511.53s -> 8513.37s]  To play and it like worked
[8513.37s -> 8523.42s]  Oh, no, sorry. That's the that's jump king. Right? I think that's the same thing
[8533.64s -> 8536.01s]  That was the powerpuff girls
[8536.01s -> 8538.01s]  Whatever whatever was from
[8538.57s -> 8544.33s]  That's from phineas and ferb
[8544.49s -> 8550.36s]  Is that show still on the air?
[8550.36s -> 8552.84s]  Are they still making new phineas and ferb cartoons?
[8564.82s -> 8568.39s]  Thank god. No
[8568.39s -> 8570.39s]  What what's wrong? Why what's wrong?
[8570.87s -> 8583.19s]  What's wrong with phineas and ferb? I've never watched the show, but what's wrong with it?
[8583.67s -> 8588.58s]  Phineas and ferb was only good new age. It's the only good new age cartoon show
[8589.30s -> 8602.86s]  What are some of the cartoons that were like worth watching? I don't remember
[8629.37s -> 8633.29s]  Nope. Holy shit. That's a that's an odd one. How do you get that jump?
[8634.09s -> 8651.16s]  Holy fuck. How are you supposed to get that?
[8652.76s -> 8703.29s]  Still haven't nailed that down yet. I'll get I will not saved
[8708.22s -> 8710.22s]  that set the jump to the
[8710.78s -> 8714.87s]  the jump to the
[8715.59s -> 8717.43s]  It's just so hard to judge it
[8717.43s -> 8719.83s]  Even when you do a little one, it doesn't seem like it's enough
[8720.47s -> 8746.04s]  Be back in an hour. Hey, i'm gonna go get some boots. What size are you?
[8747.14s -> 8751.93s]  16
[8751.93s -> 8753.93s]  I've got these big ass goofy feet
[8754.41s -> 8776.66s]  Didn't make that what why did I not make that?
[8777.38s -> 8779.38s]  What the fuck wait
[8781.06s -> 8788.57s]  What how did I not make it over that I don't understand
[8789.37s -> 8792.30s]  What?
[8792.30s -> 8794.42s]  I'm shocked
[8794.42s -> 8796.34s]  Why am I so calm?
[8796.34s -> 8798.74s]  Because it's wasted breath to be angry at a game
[8800.82s -> 8807.30s]  Who was what was it was designed to make you hate everything about your current life what you're doing right now
[8808.02s -> 8812.10s]  I'm not gonna let it win. I'm not gonna give it the satisfaction anymore. You know what i'm saying?
[8813.08s -> 8815.08s]  This game was created to make you
[8815.64s -> 8818.84s]  Scream out loud. I'm not gonna give it the satisfaction of letting it happen
[8820.36s -> 8823.80s]  I only gave it the satisfaction maybe two to three thousand times already
[8825.38s -> 8830.50s]  You know, so i'm not giving i'm not giving you anymore. You can't get it out of me anymore
[8835.62s -> 8842.25s]  Is he so calm?
[8842.25s -> 8851.96s]  I think i've reached the breaking point when I told everybody to stop saying the word boots
[8852.68s -> 8855.40s]  And then they wouldn't stop. So I was just like, all right fine
[8856.54s -> 8858.54s]  All right, I guess
[8865.88s -> 8869.16s]  And you know what else this is not even a no bullshit here i'm not kidding
[8869.80s -> 8872.52s]  I'm not i'm kidding. I'm not even getting around. I'm serious. I'm not getting
[8873.16s -> 8876.04s]  Um, this music is helping. It's great
[8876.92s -> 8898.92s]  You see what I mean there? You see what I mean? It's just like is it was that that was too far, right?
[8899.80s -> 8902.23s]  That was a little too fucking far
[8903.93s -> 8922.44s]  Yeah, why was I playing thunderstruck that was such a bad idea
[8928.47s -> 8930.47s]  I should I I need to be calm
[8930.47s -> 8932.47s]  Not like pumping my blood
[8934.78s -> 8939.10s]  I also can't speak while I jump because it just takes all my concentration
[8939.10s -> 8941.34s]  So I will never speak again when i'm in the middle of a jump
[8942.06s -> 8958.02s]  We'll stand still to talk
[8958.02s -> 8969.90s]  Play blue this game looks fun. Don't buy this game. Don't do it. Please don't
[8970.62s -> 8973.18s]  I'm i'm i'm stuck here. Don't buy this
[8975.34s -> 8977.58s]  You'll end up like me. I'm trapped
[8978.22s -> 8981.74s]  I can't get out of here. You know, you're gonna end up you end up like me. Don't do it
[8985.80s -> 8987.88s]  I'm stuck. I'm stuck in a cube right now
[9014.30s -> 9016.79s]  All right, stop stop stop stop time
[9017.27s -> 9046.81s]  Okay. Um, do I have to jump on the blue thing?
[9067.80s -> 9106.10s]  Oh, it's just new content. I've never seen before
[9107.61s -> 9111.53s]  You know what I mean? Like that. It's just brand new content that I have never seen
[9112.71s -> 9152.15s]  Uh, I should get it though. I got this down pretty pretty reliably. That's hard. Fuck. That's fucking hard
[9152.39s -> 9154.39s]  Holy shit, that's such a tiny ledge
[9155.51s -> 9158.63s]  Oh, that's such a small ledge. You gotta be perfect
[9169.66s -> 9172.46s]  Well, I did I made progress right I made progress
[9173.78s -> 9179.06s]  um
[9179.06s -> 9184.94s]  You know what i'm saying? I at least got to see this full two screens above
[9185.74s -> 9201.99s]  You know
[9201.99s -> 9203.99s]  I'm so close
[9203.99s -> 9209.74s]  Is that tower somebody give me give me hold on up that tower if I make it up the tower
[9211.37s -> 9213.37s]  That's I gotta be close
[9213.62s -> 9215.62s]  That's the end. That's the last the end of the game
[9216.95s -> 9220.55s]  Oh, man, then I I I'm gonna do it. I've got to do it
[9220.63s -> 9225.43s]  I've got to at least be the base game. I can't promise you any dlc or anything, but I gotta I gotta get up there
[9226.63s -> 9236.68s]  That's 25%
[9236.76s -> 9242.04s]  50% no you guys said 50% was the beginning of the snow level. There's no way that's 50%
[9247.11s -> 9252.31s]  All right. I gotta I gotta keep moving gotta keep moving. If you stop you turn to stone. I gotta keep moving
[9255.54s -> 9259.56s]  You know what I mean?
[9259.56s -> 9261.56s]  If I you can't I can't stop I gotta I gotta move
[9262.12s -> 9268.63s]  The the longer you take in between jumps
[9269.35s -> 9273.75s]  The more you you overanalyze every electric. Oh, what if I jump over there? What if I try that?
[9273.83s -> 9276.31s]  No, no, no, I gotta just go just go and do the jumps
[9277.03s -> 9287.96s]  There's no there's nothing. There's no sound though. So it's freaking me out. I need something in the background
[9297.61s -> 9298.41s]  um
[9298.41s -> 9301.62s]  Put on the christmas shit again. No, no, how about uh
[9302.26s -> 9313.05s]  crisp hold on a different playlist that that one was
[9314.57s -> 9316.57s]  Slowing me down too much
[9317.13s -> 9323.98s]  This is too loud
[9324.14s -> 9335.86s]  Here we go, this is why you gotta keep moving back. You can't just stop you have to keep moving
[9338.76s -> 9343.88s]  It's like an energy it's like electric bike, you know what I mean? You have to just keep powering
[9344.44s -> 9380.28s]  I hate that jump so much more than anything
[9380.94s -> 9383.90s]  That may be the worst jump of the game because I I think basketball hoop
[9384.94s -> 9391.66s]  Uh sucks, but you don't have to bounce off of one tiny little ledge of like what the fuck
[9392.06s -> 9394.94s]  You know what I mean? Like what the fuck is up with that?
[9395.90s -> 9411.40s]  I he's mad again. Oh, yes, I am
[9412.12s -> 9413.72s]  I hate that jump
[9413.72s -> 9415.16s]  I hate it
[9415.16s -> 9417.34s]  I hate it. I hate it
[9418.50s -> 9421.86s]  If I could put a cheat in right now to just have that junk be done every time
[9422.26s -> 9427.85s]  I would put it in right now and I wouldn't even care if you guys were like cheater. He's cheating. I don't care. I don't care
[9428.73s -> 9432.65s]  I don't care. I would just win. I would just win. Who cares?
[9433.45s -> 9445.91s]  It would be an empty victory
[9445.91s -> 9452.04s]  Who cares?
[9453.00s -> 9455.00s]  It would be an empty victory
[9455.64s -> 9457.64s]  Who cares who cares?
[9457.64s -> 9471.53s]  Who cares?
[9471.53s -> 9477.46s]  No, i'm this music is like is is not is fucking with me something better
[9478.02s -> 9480.02s]  This is what this playlist sucks something else
[9485.54s -> 9488.49s]  This one might be worse
[9518.82s -> 9525.05s]  I'm not happy. This is not working. It's not working. I we don't need any of this shit
[9531.43s -> 9547.39s]  Bah humbug we need a little christmas right this very minute
[9557.11s -> 9563.93s]  No, I've made that jump 100 out of 100 times i've made that jump over 100
[9565.27s -> 9566.79s]  times
[9566.79s -> 9568.31s]  Why?
[9568.31s -> 9573.03s]  Why can I not do that now? It's like i've done it a fucking 100
[9573.67s -> 9575.11s]  time a
[9575.11s -> 9577.11s]  100 fucking times
[9578.46s -> 9580.46s]  Not these two times. Oh
[9580.46s -> 9582.46s]  You can't be serious
[9587.62s -> 9590.42s]  And by the way, there's a guy just yelling in my ear
[9591.69s -> 9593.69s]  He's yelling in my ear
[9607.06s -> 9609.06s]  Under the tree
[9609.14s -> 9611.14s]  What do you see?
[9611.14s -> 9613.14s]  I bought some boots
[9613.54s -> 9618.78s]  for you
[9618.78s -> 9634.26s]  Please don't fall
[9634.26s -> 9638.34s]  He doesn't have time for that by the way, uh, santa claus is not gonna come look at your tree
[9639.30s -> 9642.50s]  He's gonna eat your food and then he's going to leave your house
[9643.30s -> 9651.69s]  He's gonna take a bite out of your cookie
[9652.09s -> 9654.09s]  And by the way, just one bite
[9654.65s -> 9657.21s]  You leave five cookies at like six carrots out
[9657.77s -> 9662.25s]  He takes one bite of one of the cookies and breaks a carrot in half and pretends to give it to rudolph
[9662.89s -> 9667.02s]  And then you just have stale ass cookies sitting outside the next day
[9680.84s -> 9682.84s]  Who's me?
[9687.05s -> 9688.89s]  Okay, i'll show
[9688.89s -> 9691.37s]  Saint nick the tree you are
[9692.97s -> 9696.49s]  What is what's he talking about?
[9698.57s -> 9735.21s]  Who is he talking to this is lagging my game I have to turn it off. Um, okay
[9759.53s -> 9761.53s]  That's it
[9762.49s -> 9764.49s]  No
[9768.23s -> 9777.56s]  That was just a low quality version that was a low quality version why was that so low quality
[9786.82s -> 9813.77s]  What
[9828.25s -> 9830.25s]  It's such a hard jump
[9830.81s -> 9836.65s]  It's so hard to do that one. You gotta sneak in how the fuck do you sneak in that shit?
[9840.20s -> 9844.20s]  No progress. No progress. I didn't get I made I made it back to where I was no progress
[9846.44s -> 9849.08s]  No, no fucking progress. Oh, there's no
[9850.44s -> 9853.16s]  Get throw all these books away. I didn't learn anything
[9915.37s -> 9917.53s]  All right, we're back. We're back. We're back. Should I go to the left?
[9917.85s -> 9923.62s]  I wonder if I should go to the left, but should I just I don't know
[9925.26s -> 9930.57s]  I don't think I can make the left. All right, that's a that's too much money
[9933.37s -> 9935.37s]  That's too much money
[9935.45s -> 9937.45s]  That's not my that's not the alert
[9938.23s -> 9940.23s]  Okay, um freddy dredd
[9940.63s -> 9942.52s]  just gave
[9942.52s -> 9945.40s]  What the fuck?
[9946.02s -> 9948.44s]  226 500 bits
[9949.16s -> 9951.06s]  That equates to
[9951.06s -> 9953.06s]  265 dollars
[9953.32s -> 9956.92s]  That's over a quarter. That's over a quarter of a thousand dollars, by the way
[9962.10s -> 9963.86s]  That's a lot of money
[9963.86s -> 9967.46s]  That's oh, that's too much money. They say jump higher
[9967.54s -> 9970.90s]  I'm trying i'm gonna try my hardest to get to the end of this game
[9971.22s -> 9974.98s]  So I can put a stamp on it and say I beat this game and i'm gonna go for it
[9974.98s -> 9978.33s]  Look at where I am right now. I'm almost there and I know
[9978.97s -> 9980.65s]  I know this dlc
[9980.65s -> 9982.65s]  But I don't need to do that
[9983.13s -> 9986.65s]  Freddy, uh freddy dredd. That's a ton of money though. Seriously without no joking around
[9987.29s -> 9989.37s]  The six six six six viewers right now
[9990.01s -> 9992.57s]  Let's put some fucking death metal on
[10023.37s -> 10025.05s]  I don't understand that jump
[10025.05s -> 10027.05s]  I'll get there over and over again. I don't understand
[10034.10s -> 10036.10s]  I gotta get up there. Let's go
[10036.10s -> 10037.62s]  Thank you freddy dredd
[10037.62s -> 10059.29s]  I bet money on you. I feel so bad laughing at you
[10076.28s -> 10091.90s]  Just pause it pause it pause it pause it pause it pause it pause it again. What the fuck happened there it happens so
[10093.58s -> 10095.18s]  Man it's that
[10095.18s -> 10101.18s]  Oh my god. Damn it. God. Damn it. God. Damn it. God. Damn it. God. Give me why god damn it
[10102.38s -> 10104.68s]  God damn it god
[10105.80s -> 10107.80s]  God damn it god
[10109.37s -> 10121.29s]  Damn it
[10121.29s -> 10125.61s]  It's better than the sewer though. I think I do think so because look at how quickly I can come back up to at least here
[10125.85s -> 10171.69s]  What's going on man? What why is it doing that? I don't understand. I'm holding it the same amount of time that I did before
[10173.99s -> 10190.70s]  What jerma, why am I doing this what playing a video game on twitch?
[10191.58s -> 10244.68s]  And trying to beat it. I don't follow you. What does this take me? Where's it taking me? Where are you taking me?
[10249.72s -> 10254.20s]  I was trying a new strategy try to go left. You can't go left. You can't go left. You've got you gotta go
[10254.97s -> 10258.33s]  All right. You cannot go left. You have to make it through that little spot on the right
[10259.78s -> 10264.28s]  I was it was worth an experiment. Damn it. I thought I was going for some reason. I don't know why
[10264.60s -> 10267.72s]  I thought I was going all the way back to the sewer or something because that was all the way to the left and
[10267.96s -> 10270.04s]  My heart hurts
[10270.04s -> 10273.40s]  My like chest is pounding. I really thought I was going all the way back to the sewer
[10274.30s -> 10293.69s]  I was getting flashbacks
[10293.69s -> 10297.29s]  I tried to speed it up. What are you doing slow down? What are you doing that for?
[10297.93s -> 10300.65s]  What are you doing that for why would you do that?
[10301.45s -> 10303.45s]  I'm just so sick of the level
[10303.61s -> 10306.09s]  And i'm just flowing through it. Why?
[10307.80s -> 10313.08s]  You can't do that in this game. It's not possible to do that unless you can speed run the game
[10313.64s -> 10318.90s]  My god, i'm so close to getting
[10320.42s -> 10323.46s]  I have i've done almost the whole goddamn thing
[10331.00s -> 10334.73s]  That's a meltdown voice
[10334.73s -> 10337.93s]  I want to find the person that can literally sit here like this and play this game
[10339.58s -> 10341.99s]  My cam's not even on
[10341.99s -> 10344.33s]  I don't think a person exists
[10344.33s -> 10348.33s]  That will just silently sit here and just accept every single horrible thing that happens
[10349.61s -> 10351.05s]  like
[10351.05s -> 10353.03s]  I guess I fell
[10353.03s -> 10355.03s]  Oh, oh well crap
[10356.07s -> 10360.66s]  Yeah, what was that? The oh, oh, that's that's the
[10361.22s -> 10365.30s]  Yeah, that's like the 2000th time I fallen down that same part. Yeah
[10367.18s -> 10370.38s]  Whatever. It's all good
[10370.38s -> 10372.26s]  Good to go
[10372.26s -> 10374.76s]  Oh god, i'm kind of tired
[10379.38s -> 10380.90s]  Garfield
[10380.90s -> 10382.90s]  Gamer garfield, maybe yeah
[10395.14s -> 10397.78s]  I had such a flow going there too. That sucks
[10399.56s -> 10402.84s]  I didn't miss one single jump getting all the way up there from candle to candle
[10403.64s -> 10405.83s]  It's all right. You just gotta do it again
[10405.83s -> 10408.07s]  That's the nature of this game
[10408.07s -> 10409.27s]  Jump king
[10409.27s -> 10433.69s]  I got caught on something. It was weird. I missed
[10434.50s -> 10437.22s]  Oh god damn it. Oh god damn it. Oh, yeah
[10439.78s -> 10443.94s]  Man, what a pain in the dick
[10444.42s -> 10456.23s]  I have to go to like that. I'm gonna have to go to like the doctor
[10456.87s -> 10465.19s]  It seems to be the trouble mr. Elwood sir
[10466.25s -> 10467.90s]  Oh, you know
[10467.90s -> 10480.34s]  dick pain
[10480.34s -> 10486.02s]  Oh, okay. Well
[10486.02s -> 10490.52s]  Yeah, yes, I I besides your hands. They look really calloused
[10491.30s -> 10493.67s]  Have you been lifting weights?
[10494.15s -> 10495.43s]  Nah
[10495.43s -> 10498.71s]  Playing this fucking game called jump king, dude. It's pretty good
[10499.51s -> 10501.98s]  It's pretty sick
[10501.98s -> 10504.86s]  I have a lot of conversations with my doctor about this guy's stuff
[10506.74s -> 10509.46s]  It's always my it's always my doctor that I have to talk to
[10510.26s -> 10523.94s]  Too much i'm going too far with that. I have to that's way too long. I'm holding that for way too long
[10574.23s -> 10584.20s]  Mr albertson, do you are are you okay? Is there an alien in your stomach? Help me help me help me help me diagnose you
[10584.97s -> 10586.73s]  What's wrong?
[10586.73s -> 10588.90s]  uh
[10590.73s -> 10592.73s]  You fell down the ice level and jump king
[10592.81s -> 10598.98s]  Because that's the only reason why you'd be making those fucking noises
[10599.38s -> 10633.38s]  The definition of insanity doing the same thing over and over again while expecting the result to differ
[10634.20s -> 10638.68s]  I would agree with that diagnosis for uh, but i'm gonna have to decline that diagnosis
[10639.24s -> 10640.20s]  because
[10640.20s -> 10641.08s]  uh
[10641.08s -> 10644.07s]  I'm at the ice level. I have I have progressed
[10644.71s -> 10681.56s]  Wait, fuck that was quick
[10681.56s -> 10683.56s]  That one's so hard to judge
[10684.20s -> 10686.84s]  It really is it's so difficult to judge that
[10693.59s -> 10696.07s]  All those are gonna be hard that's gonna be such a pain
[10697.27s -> 10698.47s]  what
[10698.55s -> 10703.14s]  What the fuck is going on? Oh, it's fun to drive my car very fast
[10703.94s -> 10705.85s]  Oh cool
[10705.85s -> 10709.29s]  All right. Enjoy your like times five, uh insurance that you have to pay
[10712.25s -> 10738.90s]  Cool new sewer. It's the end of the game
[10739.54s -> 10744.26s]  There is it's the last yes because i'm at the last part of the video game
[10756.94s -> 10762.65s]  Um, there is no chance in hell i'm doing the dlc
[10764.18s -> 10766.04s]  If I get here
[10766.04s -> 10769.48s]  I'm gonna have to incubate myself for like six months. You know what I mean?
[10770.04s -> 10789.94s]  Something's gonna hatch out of me soon
[10790.66s -> 10796.62s]  Tower again, man fuck
[10800.58s -> 10804.26s]  All right, damn
[10804.26s -> 10806.66s]  You're gonna leave let joel beat the dlc before you
[10808.17s -> 10809.50s]  Look
[10809.50s -> 10811.50s]  This is not that's not going to happen
[10814.58s -> 10818.47s]  It's not gonna happen joel if you're listening to this right now
[10819.67s -> 10824.15s]  You you go ahead and you you do the dlc that i've been told is 20 times harder than the base game
[10824.71s -> 10826.71s]  You you you can do it
[10826.87s -> 10829.83s]  And we'll be all root. We'll all gonna be rooting for you
[10834.92s -> 10837.08s]  We'll all be rooting for you
[10837.08s -> 10840.92s]  It ain't gonna be me. I will for i'll be an audience member on that one
[10841.72s -> 10873.14s]  I ain't doing that
[10884.36s -> 10886.84s]  Joel's better gamer confirmed. He hasn't done it yet
[10888.02s -> 10889.82s]  Wait, you've
[10889.82s -> 10891.98s]  You haven't even seen the movie. You don't even know how it ends
[10892.78s -> 10913.30s]  Too far. He's not gonna get the boots
[10915.05s -> 10921.91s]  No way
[10921.91s -> 10946.74s]  He's not going to get those boots, huh?
[10957.51s -> 10960.15s]  So I gotta make it to that right platform
[10969.54s -> 10972.50s]  Where's the right place to do this from without hitting your head over there?
[10973.06s -> 10984.42s]  That's the idea. That's the right idea. That's the right idea. That's the right idea. You're gonna go all the way the little
[10984.58s -> 11004.86s]  That's the right idea
[11004.86s -> 11012.74s]  Oh god damn. It's so hard. It's so hard. I can't I have to relax. I this is like I can't even
[11020.52s -> 11024.28s]  Imagine doing the dlc
[11024.28s -> 11026.71s]  I would rather
[11026.71s -> 11031.99s]  Ship my pants and leave it there all day then do one minute of the dlc of this game
[11038.87s -> 11060.02s]  That's straight facts. I got at least I made progress and now I can't even do the stupid ass candle section
[11068.02s -> 11070.02s]  Ah
[11071.70s -> 11116.68s]  This game has broken him go download it you want to you see what it's like somebody said no good answer
[11118.47s -> 11133.50s]  That's the correct answer
[11133.50s -> 11143.24s]  No
[11143.24s -> 11179.46s]  No, you should play guitar hero. That's a muted stream. The whole that whole stream is off. Okay. Come on. Come on
[11209.35s -> 11218.55s]  Oh man, oh man, I like hit my face so I couldn't recover fucking jump king
[11223.85s -> 11234.06s]  Jump left. I already tried that it doesn't work. I jumped out and I went all the way down
[11234.62s -> 11248.82s]  That way works. All right. All right. I'm gonna tell you I went left. I couldn't get it
[11248.82s -> 11258.22s]  I went right and I got it

[11557.61s -> 11577.54s]  I'm so scared of hitting my head on that fucking thing
[11578.50s -> 11585.29s]  It's the same thing the third time in a row
[11586.26s -> 11590.02s]  I I have to jump higher than that. You know what I mean? I'm just so scared to do it
[11590.98s -> 11596.34s]  I'm terrified to jump higher than that because I feel like i'm gonna hit my head and fall but i'm gonna fall anyways

[11870.17s -> 11872.73s]  Just a little bit. I have to pull it back a little bit after that
[11874.42s -> 11878.02s]  Too much there, too. And now i'm like i'm like a fucking lightning rod right now

[12597.67s -> 12599.01s]  I'm
[12599.01s -> 12617.77s]  upset
[12617.77s -> 12620.81s]  He's actually mad. Yeah, yeah just a little
[12621.61s -> 12624.81s]  Just just a little bit. I think I think just a little yeah
[12626.87s -> 12629.19s]  I've fallen down 1100 fucking times
[12631.16s -> 12634.44s]  I've jumped almost 13 000 times
[12635.61s -> 12639.99s]  so
[12639.99s -> 12642.95s]  I think I I I could be just a tad
[12643.75s -> 12645.75s]  Just slightly
[12652.76s -> 12657.48s]  You think you'd get better by now? I'm almost banned that person. I'm at the end of the fucking game
[12657.96s -> 12659.96s]  I'm at the end of the game
[12665.50s -> 12668.14s]  This is the final like 10 screens
[12673.26s -> 12677.10s]  And I have improved you remember the first time I was here. I don't even need to explain myself
[12677.10s -> 12721.78s]  I think i'm gonna beat it right now too hard, but it's okay. I don't go left. I go left after that jump
[12741.37s -> 12743.45s]  I don't think I can go left guys
[12745.64s -> 12751.08s]  No, I can't why would I listen to anyone that says that why would I ever listen to you?
[12751.64s -> 12757.64s]  That's the stupidest idea it's guaranteed to fall all the way down. Why would you ever jump left?
[12758.36s -> 12761.48s]  Let's so we let's prove that i'm glad we proved that
[12762.04s -> 12766.44s]  That if you miss that jump you'll get you go all the way back. Why would anyone go left?
[12768.10s -> 12770.58s]  Uh, oh, you'll never see me ever do that again
[12771.38s -> 12775.14s]  And if somebody like wants to just go hey dude that paper you should think about god ban them
[12778.49s -> 12780.49s]  I don't care if there's only 12 people left in this chat
[12785.27s -> 12786.47s]  I
[12786.47s -> 12824.14s]  Don't actually do that though go left and then fall all the way down to the bottom. Hey, you're wrong
[12889.29s -> 12893.66s]  That was so long, yeah, I just got sorry guys I just got sucked through like a portal
[12898.15s -> 12900.55s]  A wormhole opened up behind me and I got sucked into it
[12901.35s -> 12933.29s]  Just imagine if I had to go to the sewer. Oh, man. I feel that makes me feel better. I know and
[12933.85s -> 12935.85s]  I've lost my mojo thing
[12936.57s -> 12942.58s]  I need I need like a a new I need mojo. What do I get it? How do I get it?
[12942.74s -> 12944.50s]  I'm not sure where I get it from
[12944.50s -> 12956.22s]  I lost my mojo. Oh god damn screens from the end of the game
[12959.22s -> 12965.78s]  You man like i'm two screens away from the beating this dumb game
[12984.95s -> 12990.01s]  It's okay i'll get it i'm just gonna take me a while
[12990.73s -> 13004.73s]  I'll get it. I'm just gonna sit back in the chair
[13010.62s -> 13013.58s]  Uh, you guys will hear from me the next time I fall when I scream into my cup again
[13014.87s -> 13016.87s]  Two screams away, right?
[13092.95s -> 13096.07s]  Sorry, I said there's like there was 200 bugs on my disk I had to get them
[13096.87s -> 13102.06s]  There's just there's bugs everywhere. Sorry. I had to get all this shit load of them
[13127.06s -> 13143.61s]  Fucking close to never having to open this game ever again
[13144.33s -> 13146.33s]  It's I can taste it
[13146.87s -> 13150.15s]  And then I can just delete it out of my steam library
[13159.34s -> 13161.34s]  dlc
[13161.50s -> 13163.02s]  No
[13163.02s -> 13164.95s]  Nope
[13164.95s -> 13166.31s]  Nope
[13166.31s -> 13167.78s]  Nope
[13167.78s -> 13169.32s]  Nope
[13169.32s -> 13172.01s]  No, thanks
[13172.01s -> 13173.46s]  Uh
[13173.46s -> 13185.45s]  No, thank you. Hey germa, uh, I punched you in the face like two or three hours ago
[13185.45s -> 13187.45s]  Would you like me to punch you in the stomach too like now?
[13188.82s -> 13192.74s]  No, I don't think I would like that. Oh, are you sure? Yeah, i'm positive
[13199.53s -> 13201.53s]  I don't think that would that's something I would enjoy
[13202.17s -> 13210.30s]  Are you sure dude like everyone's doing it? Okay. Good luck to them
[13222.18s -> 13227.70s]  Dude everyone's everyone's getting punched in the stomach. Don't you want to get punched in the stomach?
[13232.20s -> 13242.42s]  Uh go let's do it
[13243.38s -> 13247.42s]  Get me up here
[13247.42s -> 13311.24s]  Come on punch me in the face. Did you not learn from your mistake?
[13312.04s -> 13315.75s]  i'm trying to get up there
[13315.99s -> 13317.67s]  and it takes
[13317.67s -> 13322.47s]  A pixel perfect jump to do so i'm trying to find it
[13325.67s -> 13329.56s]  Dude, don't you know you shouldn't do that. Why are you doing that?
[13330.52s -> 13332.52s]  Oh, i'm not i'm doing it on purpose
[13332.76s -> 13336.68s]  I just think figured it would be funny if I fell down the whole thing again had to do like another 20 minutes
[13336.68s -> 13339.40s]  Of climbing the whole fucking thing. I wouldn't that be funny
[13340.52s -> 13368.34s]  He's admitting it
[13368.34s -> 13370.34s]  No, man
[13371.40s -> 13374.76s]  You know, all right. Here's the worst part about this game is you can't
[13375.40s -> 13379.64s]  You can't just like all right. Let me just like relax and get it. No every jump has to be perfect
[13380.04s -> 13383.56s]  You have to do every single jump 100 100 focus
[13384.26s -> 13386.26s]  101
[13387.03s -> 13389.53s]  100 focus on everything
[13390.09s -> 13396.41s]  You know, you know, it's like god damn it. Can I get a single a single fucking break?
[13397.05s -> 13417.43s]  Ricky, all right. It's almost it's almost time for cold water dunk on face
[13425.50s -> 13427.50s]  If I fall all the way to the bottom again
[13427.82s -> 13430.78s]  I'm gonna go just like put ice cubes down my pants in my underwear
[13433.40s -> 13690.42s]  It can't make it any worse
[13690.90s -> 13694.86s]  I stuck my head in the freezer
[13694.94s -> 13696.94s]  I bobbed for ice cubes
[13697.27s -> 13698.87s]  Okay, let's go
[13698.87s -> 13703.56s]  Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go
[13732.36s -> 13735.11s]  Come on
[13735.11s -> 13737.11s]  What am I doing? Don't go that way
[13739.91s -> 13742.63s]  oh
[13742.63s -> 13754.76s]  Shit, so when I was down, uh putting my head in the freezer. I uh
[13755.82s -> 13758.46s]  I I did the not like this emote
[13759.48s -> 13761.32s]  unironically
[13761.32s -> 13762.84s]  I just was like
[13762.84s -> 13765.85s]  Oh not like this
[13765.85s -> 13767.85s]  And it wasn't even like a joke
[13781.11s -> 13783.67s]  Now I have like a I have i'm not gonna say it but I have
[13784.31s -> 13789.08s]  Because like that that's turned into a weird meme on the channel right now, so I don't even want to say what I have
[13800.66s -> 13809.56s]  No a coke
[13809.96s -> 13818.66s]  Right now i'm having like these flashes
[13819.14s -> 13823.62s]  of
[13823.62s -> 13825.88s]  Like mowing the lawn
[13825.88s -> 13827.88s]  And i'm like damn that sounds pretty good right now
[13828.44s -> 13844.47s]  That sounds fun. We're at peak boomer
[13845.69s -> 13848.49s]  Yeah, that sounds like a good time and like mowing the lawn and shit
[13849.69s -> 13852.33s]  Taking care of my grass. That sounds good to me
[13865.02s -> 13869.34s]  Hard I gotta get back into this again. Remember I got up from the chair, so that's bad
[13918.94s -> 13928.65s]  You gotta hold it longer, but if you hold it longer than that you hit the wall and bounce back
[13929.45s -> 13935.18s]  That's the that's that's the wall right now is going past that shit. I did it once
[13936.38s -> 13942.84s]  That's the fucking wall right now
[13943.93s -> 13945.93s]  It's trying to figure out like the
[13946.25s -> 13949.39s]  The nuanced way to make that jump reliably
[13950.33s -> 13952.33s]  Because fuck I can't
[13970.04s -> 13972.04s]  No, I held it I held it longer
[13972.68s -> 13976.36s]  I did hold it longer though. Fuck man. I did hold it longer
[13977.08s -> 13992.89s]  I seriously did
[13992.89s -> 14005.18s]  fun game blast
[14015.61s -> 14016.97s]  sewer two
[14016.97s -> 14018.33s]  sewer three
[14018.33s -> 14028.68s]  I just don't get it because if you if you go
[14029.72s -> 14032.44s]  Too soft. You just don't make it if you go too hard you hit the wall
[14032.68s -> 14036.84s]  There's no in between because there's a block above it and jumping left is guaranteed
[14037.96s -> 14041.00s]  You have to get that left jump. Perfect. It's perfect either way

[19831.15s -> 19838.45s]  up with my frustrations but they were self-inflicted I knew I was gonna be able to beat it
[19840.74s -> 19845.62s]  so you will not see me until Friday uh I have a few things I have to take care of for the next
[19845.62s -> 19856.32s]  couple of days we'll be going Friday Saturday Sunday this weekend and keep an eye on keep an
[19856.32s -> 19863.46s]  eye on the discord over the next couple of days because I'm gonna put up some nominations some
[19863.46s -> 19871.02s]  nominee lists for the end of the year war stream awards uh that'll be up there over the next couple
[19871.02s -> 19876.10s]  days there's going to be a list of categories and you will be able to discuss what you would
[19876.10s -> 19887.44s]  like to nominate play the surge too uh maybe I will uh Nancy Drew is this weekend I don't know
[19887.44s -> 19890.96s]  what you're talking about we'll probably do Nancy Drew on like Saturday or something or even Friday
[19890.96s -> 19900.66s]  whatever but that's gonna be it there was a ton of I missed a lot of stuff because I was locked in
[19900.66s -> 19907.44s]  and and and bolting so we're gonna go over the subs and bits that I missed and I'm gonna go take
[19907.44s -> 19911.12s]  a bath and I'm gonna go scream into my pillow and be so happy that I actually beat the at least the
[19911.12s -> 19922.54s]  bass game jump king I'm happy about it the ice cubes melt my pants are just wet now so
[19923.26s -> 19934.70s]  but anyways let's go back uh five and a half hours ago now let's go we had 500 bits from
[19934.70s -> 19939.26s]  guild hero I hope today you make a joke that mutes the vod for eight minutes again germa venus
[19939.26s -> 19942.86s]  yeah I did we were playing Christmas music the whole time this vod probably doesn't exist
[19943.26s -> 19959.82s]  uh thunder it's evaporated by now I tell you I'm just like a wet hot 150 degree weirdo I don't know
[19959.82s -> 19968.13s]  what's wrong with me superintendent Chalmers thanks for the 250 here are two bt tv emotes the
[19968.13s -> 19974.51s]  first one I made today and the second one almost three years ago uh the thing about the bt tv
[19974.51s -> 19982.54s]  emotes I want to slowly put them in and we're probably gonna do another emote night and the
[19982.62s -> 19990.78s]  emote night will specifically be for bt tv slots and instead of picking like five or 10
[19991.74s -> 20001.95s]  we'll probably just dump in like 30 like 20 of them there will be more paid sub emotes
[20002.67s -> 20007.47s]  if I have at least another five to ten of them in mind but I think opening up bt tv
[20008.94s -> 20014.74s]  is makes more sense because I don't I really don't want to have you know obviously if I do
[20014.74s -> 20018.34s]  like an emote contest type thing there it's it's not supposed to be a competition
[20019.14s -> 20024.58s]  and we got some great emotes last time but I would really rather not have it be a situation
[20024.58s -> 20030.26s]  where people are competing against each other for the five to ten emote slots when we can just pick
[20030.26s -> 20039.86s]  a shitload of just good ones and just put them in through bt tv why is that backwards oh that's part
[20039.86s -> 20050.30s]  of the channel points okay how's the dopamine treating you you junkie streamer I'm fine when
[20050.38s -> 20053.42s]  is the green screen stream I have postponed the green screen stream
[20054.62s -> 20062.62s]  until I am physically able to move around a lot right now my rib cage and my kind of chest
[20063.34s -> 20071.01s]  and back are kind of in pain and I can sit down and mess around like I can move
[20071.01s -> 20076.85s]  up on my chair but standing up and like jumping and falling and prat falling and punching and
[20076.85s -> 20081.81s]  throwing and diving and flipping I can't I just physically can't do it right now
[20084.96s -> 20091.44s]  I would make my issue a lot worse and until I see a physical therapist I have to figure out how I'm
[20091.44s -> 20097.28s]  gonna go about doing anything because my it's just annoying I don't want to make it worse
[20098.16s -> 20106.29s]  am I gonna play fear too yes I don't know when though but hang on to your bt tv emotes if they're
[20106.29s -> 20113.26s]  not enabled now we'll figure it out we'll do like another emote night I do appreciate any emotes
[20113.26s -> 20117.34s]  that people throw in there I think there's an emote channel on the discord I think too
[20118.06s -> 20124.24s]  you can play red alert hmm probably not red alert one maybe I'll do red alert two and I would want
[20124.24s -> 20133.62s]  to do some skirmishes but thank you superintendent Chalmers appreciate it sir can I thanks for the 250
[20133.62s -> 20137.86s]  chat germa is holding me hostage but I need you all to know all these streams are pre-recorded
[20137.86s -> 20142.82s]  and germa is still stuck in anor londo he makes me watch as he fails over and over non-stop all he
[20142.82s -> 20152.77s]  does is play dark souls 24 7 oh no I think he noticed monkey s thank you silent serenity for
[20152.77s -> 20158.85s]  the 250 why are you playing this game again you're going to die from the stress hey I'm still here
[20159.49s -> 20175.87s]  and I beat it I still I'm still here and he went halfway through the dlc cool pretty cool prove it
[20175.87s -> 20185.18s]  you're in hell thank you silent serenity for the two thank you zake the 250 as well this game
[20185.18s -> 20189.82s]  didn't look that hard so I decided to buy it and prove everyone wrong by setting a new speed one
[20189.82s -> 20195.02s]  world record on the first try you were right I'd rather have a root canal than play this for hours
[20195.02s -> 20208.77s]  germa pain it's tough it's tricky it is it's really tricky it's hard what did I say did I
[20208.77s -> 20217.89s]  say it was harder than sakiro what did I give sakiro a difficulty like an 89 or like an 88 and
[20217.89s -> 20231.63s]  I give us a 100 100 what a fucking psycho yeah I did say I hated all video games you're right I
[20231.63s -> 20239.04s]  did why would I do that the guy who rated you yesterday was speedrunning this game
[20240.26s -> 20257.15s]  that's awesome well thank you zake enjoy the pain if you must if you would like to uh hi kiko morris
[20257.15s -> 20262.59s]  sunday thanks for the 500 bits hi germa I had a dream that I was a senior in high school again
[20262.59s -> 20267.31s]  and you were a bus driver driving my class to a field trip we had a heated argument about
[20267.31s -> 20272.27s]  egg salad the whole trip which was like an hour and a half and when lunchtime came around I found
[20272.27s -> 20277.39s]  you and we had lunch together while talking about life it was pretty cool you know what else is cool
[20277.39s -> 20292.29s]  you never changed your heart hey it was a pleasure to share lunch with you in your dream I drove the
[20292.29s -> 20306.74s]  bus that's let's have some egg salad because you're epic I'm not saying that oh my god
[20306.74s -> 20311.30s]  taeyon thanks for the two dollars and 65 cents 265 bits I worry about you germa I don't know
[20311.30s -> 20316.77s]  what's worse watching you play this game with gambling in it oh no watching you play this or
[20316.77s -> 20325.50s]  a game with gambling in it no we were at like a seven out of simpsons hit and go we're fine
[20325.50s -> 20333.02s]  trust me I would know dr pepper 25 dr pepper thanks for the 250 bits it would be awesome if
[20333.02s -> 20337.50s]  you'd play dark souls 2 on stream I know people say it's the worst I'm trying to play it right
[20337.50s -> 20344.94s]  now it'd be cool to see I probably won't do dark souls 2 on stream I've beaten dark souls 2 a few
[20344.94s -> 20357.52s]  times and I'm it's just I'm not I don't really I don't think I'd want to stream it it's no I've
[20357.52s -> 20363.14s]  played it through it already I really don't want to play through it again I did scarlet the first
[20363.14s -> 20368.26s]  in when it came out off stream I wasn't I don't think I was even streaming like really back then
[20373.65s -> 20384.30s]  I did stream it once though and it was an issue dark souls 2 controls like a sinking boat
[20391.22s -> 20402.70s]  uh thank you linda irate gamer screen cap for the 500 bits that's a that's a name uh don't give up
[20402.70s -> 20407.10s]  your mom I don't really believe in you but if you believe in yourself you might do better I did it
[20407.82s -> 20414.35s]  all it took was some weird guy on a CD from 1994 to tell me that I was worth doing worth it
[20419.54s -> 20428.58s]  sometimes it works you got to pull it out when you need it I don't pull out cheers to you unless
[20428.58s -> 20435.30s]  it's absolutely necessary and it hasn't worked at least one other time I've done that and I
[20435.30s -> 20451.31s]  think that that's the third time you've heard that on the stream it didn't work in hit and run no
[20452.56s -> 20460.64s]  no and sometimes it's too powerful first person dark souls 3 oh my god I forgot about that
[20462.18s -> 20466.18s]  didn't I die in first person to the abyss watchers like 150 times I don't remember
[20466.98s -> 20481.44s]  it was like at least four hours or something and you fought abyss watchers most yeah that stream
[20481.44s -> 20493.57s]  went to look at how fun and funny these mods are to I hate dark souls 3 right I was playing

[21415.65s -> 21421.39s]  gotten the boots it's all right everyone has an opinion on how to play the game
[21423.26s -> 21426.22s]  I was of the opinion that don't get boots and you're of the opinion get boots
[21427.26s -> 21435.28s]  we can just have those different opinions thank you for the 15 dollars thank you pray
[21435.28s -> 21440.96s]  oh no it's not it's pray for discord not pay for discord boots would have shaved off an hour

[21993.06s -> 21997.86s]  can't just turn on disco alcium for four hours and be like okay that was fun it's like a 40 hour
[21997.86s -> 22004.10s]  game right so I'd have to commit to that for at least a couple of streams at least two or three
[22006.18s -> 22028.45s]  it would be fun maybe chat would throw a fit well I haven't decided if I'm gonna do it or not
[22029.49s -> 22033.57s]  we'll see but if I've run out of stuff to stream over the next couple weeks you know if nothing's
[22033.57s -> 22038.13s]  really coming out or I don't really care that much about anything then we'll start to pull into the
[22038.13s -> 22041.97s]  catalog that's why I don't want to say oh I'm never going to play Jedi Fallen Order because
[22041.97s -> 22047.41s]  there's a very real possibility that like a week or two from now it's just oh this kind of that's
