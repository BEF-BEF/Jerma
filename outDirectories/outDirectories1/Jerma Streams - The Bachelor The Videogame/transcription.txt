[2.49s -> 11.05s]  So, I bought this shit. I know this game sucks, but when am I going to do this? There is no
[11.05s -> 17.03s]  opportunity for me to put this in. Zero. I don't have any other chance to play this right now.
[17.03s -> 22.02s]  It's the only time it's going to happen. Otherwise it's just going to sit there,
[22.02s -> 25.54s]  and I know it's going to be terrible. It's not even going to be funny. It's going to be such a
[25.54s -> 34.01s]  shit game. It's the bachelor video game for the Wii. I've been trying to find a place to put this
[34.65s -> 43.43s]  on stream, and I can't. It's so bad. When it's three hours, I'm thinking like probably like
[43.43s -> 50.55s]  another couple hours on this. I don't know. I have to play this. I bought it. What do you say?
[50.55s -> 62.49s]  Well, I have no other opportunity. This is it. This is the opportunity. I've got my opportunity
[62.49s -> 73.83s]  right here. Let's change it up. That's your fault. Yeah, but okay. Let me level with it here. I'm
[73.83s -> 77.99s]  not going to start a stream with the bachelor for Wii. You know what I mean? This is like a
[77.99s -> 82.41s]  put this in for 10 minutes, and have everybody tell me this game is horrible. Please do something
[82.41s -> 97.32s]  else. To a point where the spam is uncontrollable, and I'm forced to change games, right? 10 hours.
[97.32s -> 103.80s]  All right, here we go. Let me make sure this is actually accurate, because the GameCube actually
[103.80s -> 133.98s]  pulls the screen differently. I already hate this. I already don't want to do this. Okay,
[133.98s -> 141.56s]  I probably don't need the nunchuck, but... And guess what we're doing? We're going on camera for this,
[141.56s -> 143.96s]  because I have to hold the Wii mode in my hand, and I probably have to go,
[144.44s -> 148.60s]  catch the fucking flies with your fucking net, right? So I have to do it like this. So we're
[148.60s -> 157.32s]  going to be on camera. All right, by the way, remember, the Wii processes the data through
[157.32s -> 160.28s]  the capture card differently, so it might be a little different. Let's check this out. Ready?
[163.32s -> 180.92s]  We all right? Let's see if I have to change it. I have to move the resolution a little bit, because
[182.12s -> 191.56s]  see how bad it looks. Actually, it's not that bad. You can pull it out a little bit.
[192.52s -> 227.37s]  That's hard. I'm trying just to see. It's hard to see. I could have changed this game title.
[230.65s -> 241.35s]  Is somebody naked? Oh, this is the product of the Wii being the most popular console
[242.07s -> 255.72s]  ever, and your grandparents potentially owning it. I can't believe this is even a game that's
[255.72s -> 263.54s]  on here. The Bachelor. I can't even click it. I have typed in the Bachelo. The Bachelor
[264.34s -> 275.82s]  I can't even click the fucking game. Does it say the Bachelor? This was on the DS. How? All right,
[275.82s -> 280.94s]  select a contestant. Well, I've, I've, I've, that's, I've, I don't, I mean, that's me already done,
[282.25s -> 314.06s]  and I'm a movie producer. I can't change that. Love test. I kind of want to do the love test.
[314.06s -> 329.43s]  Personality quiz. Let's do the personality quiz. It's complete season one. Okay, the dating style
[329.43s -> 335.67s]  quiz. Okay, how do you make a first impression? I like to dress in style. Nope, I went jogging
[335.67s -> 341.83s]  pants and like cut off t-shirts everywhere. A warm smile and hello works for me. Nope, that's not,
[341.83s -> 351.64s]  also not true because I smile like this. So no, that's inaccurate. Be respectful and show up on
[351.64s -> 356.28s]  time. I'm late to everything. I've never showed up on time to do a single thing in my whole life.
[357.24s -> 361.32s]  Arrive with flowers and chocolates in hand. I'm never prepared for anything.
[361.32s -> 365.88s]  So I would, that's, none of these are accurate. What happens if I don't do any of these?
[382.15s -> 393.34s]  Whatever. Season one. It's Jerma and Diana Pappas. How do you play this game?
[397.99s -> 401.83s]  It's going to be, it's the party games. It has to be. It's on the Wii. It's going to be party games.
[402.55s -> 413.30s]  Are you guys at a funeral? No, you're the bachelor with your host, Chris Harrison.
[417.06s -> 420.46s]  Okay, why am I so sad?
[425.90s -> 429.10s]  This character just turned and just fucking just blasted the other guy.
[440.14s -> 446.87s]  Welcome back, Diana Pappas. Holy shit, they say the name. Oh my God. I thought it was going to be
[446.87s -> 453.37s]  like, please welcome back our contestant. Before we begin, I can provide a for the game.
[454.17s -> 464.42s]  Yes, let's, how does this work? You participate in a series of dates. Let's go on dates. Each one
[464.42s -> 468.50s]  has an exciting challenge to be met and will be your chance to impress the bachelor.
[468.50s -> 475.18s]  Kissing under a restaurant table. You know that this is, this is, oh, you could, it's okay to do
[475.18s -> 483.10s]  that at dinner up top. This is not that Disney dog movie that this is okay where you're humans.
[485.56s -> 490.60s]  Okay, depending on the type of date card you receive, you'll either go on a group date
[490.60s -> 500.06s]  or a one-on-one date. What do you mean go on a group date? Group dates involve everyone
[500.06s -> 508.71s]  while one-on-one dates. Why would you go on a group date? The instructions on how to play are
[508.71s -> 518.14s]  explained on each date card. You can also warm up by selecting practice. Oh, this is like dealing
[518.14s -> 523.02s]  with somebody that has to plan everything, like obsessive compulsively. Oh, did you get your date
[523.02s -> 526.22s]  card? Did you get your date card that explains everything about what's going to happen on our
[526.22s -> 535.40s]  date? Like, um, I have to go, my entire family has got hit by a car. It's like, oh, okay, sorry,
[535.40s -> 540.52s]  I gotta get out of here. You'll earn heart points based on your performance. The better you do,
[540.52s -> 549.14s]  the more hearts you'll collect. Sometimes the bachelorette will even send out small
[549.14s -> 552.66s]  floating hearts. And I gotta catch it. Catching any of these will improve your odds with her.
[552.66s -> 558.52s]  I knew it. I told you we were gonna get like a net to have to catch things. However, not everyone
[558.52s -> 563.56s]  will make it. During the rose ceremony, the contestant with the least number of hearts
[563.56s -> 569.64s]  will be eliminated. No, I will not marry you. It's not happening. Along with his dream of
[569.64s -> 575.00s]  marrying the bachelorette. Isn't this some statistic somewhere that, so, what a great,
[575.00s -> 579.16s]  uh, little slide here. Along with the dream of marrying the bachelorette. The boy with, oh,
[580.12s -> 584.36s]  I choose you. We're dating now. Where we love each other. Isn't this some statistic that
[584.36s -> 591.64s]  none of them ever work out? You get to the very end and they stop dating within like three days.
[592.36s -> 596.38s]  That happens almost every single time. Why do people still watch this show?
[596.94s -> 607.08s]  Are we all ready for the first date? I wish you all the best. Let the journey begin. Let's go.
[607.80s -> 620.65s]  All right, first date card. What's it gonna say? Group date in the hot air balloon. The skies are
[620.65s -> 625.61s]  all clear for lift off. Let's get these air balloons up in the air. Don't get left on the ground.
[625.61s -> 631.78s]  We have to take an individual balloon? Who could inflate their air balloon the fastest? Pressing
[631.78s -> 635.86s]  a hold. Do we have to do it? Wait, don't we hire a company to do this? Press and hold the A button
[635.86s -> 639.94s]  on the Wii remote to keep the needle inside the green margin to inflate your balloon.
[641.06s -> 667.56s]  I don't even know which one I am. Top left? This is it. Get that heart. Got it. Oh, that's hard.
[668.36s -> 684.12s]  I got an extra heart. I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm tied first. What is it? What does this guy
[684.12s -> 697.59s]  below me have? Six? Seven. I gotta get, I gotta get there first. I don't know why this makes me want
[697.59s -> 703.42s]  to scream. Okay, I'm good. I did it. I don't know why it makes me want to fucking scream when I was
[703.42s -> 708.28s]  doing that. I was just like, I want to like get energy out of me. I hate that. I hated that. Okay,
[708.28s -> 723.06s]  I win. Jerma, Nate, Simon and Keith all going for the same love. It actually is just, is Mario
[723.06s -> 729.86s]  Party. Now I have to drive a car. Automatic plus one letter grid. It's time for some off-road racing.
[729.86s -> 732.82s]  Yeah, if we have that rule, we have to use it whenever it's available.
[734.02s -> 742.12s]  Um, I don't make those rules. Who will finish first in the off-road race? Point at your vehicle
[742.12s -> 749.34s]  with the Wii mode and hold down the A button while moving left and right to navigate the race
[749.34s -> 756.63s]  course. What do I mean? Hold, point at your vehicle. Why would I not do this like every other Wii game?
[757.35s -> 774.94s]  Are you kidding me? This is a game. This is a game already. This exists. It's like an old one.
[774.94s -> 779.98s]  You know, where have I, I'm seeing, you know what I'm saying? Well, you know, this is a game that
[779.98s -> 787.05s]  does this already and it's an old one. It's a physical thing you do this with. It's hurting
[787.05s -> 798.31s]  my head to think about this. I need to know what that is. I had one of these. Yeah, I did too.
[799.03s -> 822.34s]  None of these guys get in the extra hearts. Um, this is awful. This is awful, awful, awful, awful.
[823.14s -> 834.54s]  I'm still going to beat it and I'm still going to get first place on that date.
[835.26s -> 843.21s]  You bet your ass. I'm going to get that one-on-one date.
[851.54s -> 856.98s]  Ice skates. Does she, does she come with us? Or is she just standing, like, just stand up here?
[858.02s -> 864.28s]  Who can collect hexagons the fastest? Press and hold the A button anywhere on the ice to mark
[864.28s -> 871.00s]  hexagons. The longer you hold, the more hexagons you mark. Release the A button to collect
[871.00s -> 904.82s]  your hexagons. Why is nobody doing anything? Oh, I get it. That motherfucker got so lucky.
[905.70s -> 921.03s]  Oh, come on. Do it. I'm going to get this whole corner right now. The whole thing. Get the fuck
[921.03s -> 931.27s]  out of my way. Got it. It's not going to hit me. I'm going to be able to get this whole thing.
[956.98s -> 986.14s]  Two, three. Got it. It's going to go underneath. Oh, am I in the lead? Take this whole corner.
[987.64s -> 994.70s]  Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Why do I care? This is the worst minigame.
[994.70s -> 999.43s]  Spare us from this hell. No, I'm interested. It takes five minutes for me to realize if it was
[999.43s -> 1004.79s]  worth doing. It's worth doing. I'm interested. I'm going to get that one-on-one date and then
[1004.79s -> 1008.39s]  we're taking the, we're taking all the, I'm beating the whole game. No, why did I say that?
[1008.39s -> 1010.63s]  I'm not doing that. I'll be probably like a tenth of the game.
[1010.63s -> 1029.64s]  Why was this on the, why was this on the coke? What is this? What is that?
[1039.78s -> 1064.68s]  It's not a tooth. It's not a tooth. That fucking tooth just comes up. It just like falls out.
[1065.24s -> 1071.53s]  All right. Let's get, let's take some shots. For each mystery photo, be the first to answer
[1071.53s -> 1075.69s]  the question. All right. So we have to find out what the mystery photo is.
[1076.49s -> 1097.56s]  Ready? How many chairs are in this picture? You guys are so slow. Bachelor is holding her
[1098.28s -> 1112.73s]  by the shoulders, torso by the arms. The contestant at the far right is holding
[1114.68s -> 1120.34s]  cheese, a spatula. It's going to be, oh, he got it wrong. Fuck. How do you guys know this?
[1123.69s -> 1136.92s]  In this picture, Brad is drinking wine. Drinking wine. Fuck. Pouring wine. In this picture,
[1136.92s -> 1142.63s]  the people are not, it's definitely not playing baseball. They're writing, eating,
[1143.43s -> 1167.13s]  making a toast. Eating. What is in this photo? Floating restaurant. Yeah. In this picture,
[1167.13s -> 1170.01s]  we can see a pair of sandals and a plastic beetroot. A plastic beetroot is in a bottle of
[1170.01s -> 1173.13s]  sunscreen. A bottle of sunscreen and a pair of sandals in a bottle of sunscreen. This one.
[1173.45s -> 1193.98s]  That's it. How many wine glasses are on the table? Two, three, four, or eight. Where was this picture
[1193.98s -> 1201.82s]  taken? In a bathroom. In the desert. On the beach. I'm winning, motherfuckers. I'm getting that one
[1201.82s -> 1207.42s]  on one date. In this picture, the female contestant is wearing a brown dress, blue, red, and yellow
[1207.42s -> 1227.00s]  dress. Oh. Oh, you got me. How many female contestants are wearing sunglasses? There was
[1227.00s -> 1234.02s]  no way to discern what was going on in that photo. Not possible. What's in the foreground?
[1234.66s -> 1252.70s]  The beach. In the background, we can see the sea. A road. Snowfall. A wall. A wall. It's a
[1252.70s -> 1259.56s]  snow. A wall. The sea. It's just a Truman Show? That's not what the sea looks like in the background.
[1259.56s -> 1263.80s]  That's a fucking Truman Show wall. The female contestants' eyes are looking at. Her eyes are
[1263.80s -> 1269.50s]  closed. His mouth. I think they're looking at his eye. His mouth. His mouth. Yeah, I thought they
[1269.50s -> 1278.52s]  were kissing. Her eyes are closed. The couple is looking at the sunset. Roasting marshmallows.
[1278.52s -> 1292.52s]  Kissing. Swimming. Gonna be looking at the sunset. They are not kissing in that photo. Zoom the fuck
[1292.52s -> 1296.94s]  in. They were at least three or four inches away from each other's faces. From the left, the yellow
[1296.94s -> 1305.03s]  surfboard is fourth. Alright, gotta get one more. One more. In this picture, the man is playing golf.
[1305.03s -> 1313.53s]  Cutting grass. Playing baseball. Cutting grass. Cutting grass. Playing golf. How did I come in?
[1313.53s -> 1329.77s]  How? I got five questions first. Whatever, I got more hearts anyways. You didn't catch enough. I win.
[1335.64s -> 1343.70s]  One-on-one date. A one-on-one date invitation has arrived. Who is it for? It's for me.
[1350.15s -> 1359.08s]  Jerma, you're going on a one-on-one date. Jerma, you're in Smash Brothers. The Bachelorette chose
[1359.08s -> 1365.22s]  you and she would like to keep the intimacy going. She's waiting for you here with a finest.
[1365.94s -> 1383.13s]  Okay, here we go. Oh, it's a fucking ugly couch. Why do they look like YouTube Kids animated
[1383.13s -> 1387.62s]  characters? I feel like suddenly we're going to start singing about like eating your carrots
[1387.62s -> 1393.83s]  and peas and shit over and over again. Point at each falling feather with the Wii mode. Press
[1393.83s -> 1405.45s]  A on them before they reach the bottom. Wait, is this? Why are there other people here? Get the
[1405.45s -> 1420.18s]  fuck out of here. This is my date. Oh, they're the ones dropping them. Okay, it's hard to aim
[1420.18s -> 1460.92s]  when you're scrunched up like I am. I win. I win. Does that mean that I win the game?
[1485.21s -> 1494.25s]  Another one-on-one date? I get two one-on-one dates in a row?
[1498.76s -> 1501.08s]  If you don't get a rose. I know I'm getting a rose.
[1503.59s -> 1509.99s]  Bonus hearts. Yeah, I win. It's impossible. Will you accept this rose?
[1510.95s -> 1523.03s]  You did it. Of course I did. Why are you sad about that? That means you get to keep going.
[1523.67s -> 1530.25s]  Why would you be sad about getting a rose? Why would you be? Eight hearts.
[1532.38s -> 1535.90s]  This guy was on his phone half of these mini games. He wouldn't even try it.
[1544.71s -> 1548.95s]  That was Binding of Isaac music. Everything is Binding of Isaac. Everything, apparently.
[1548.95s -> 1559.74s]  Everything. Next round of dates? Wait, that was an entire season. Congratulations,
[1559.74s -> 1565.90s]  you unlocked Close to You. The Caring and Kindness Quiz. I can't wait to take all these quizzes.
[1566.70s -> 1578.42s]  Oh no, that was just episode one. Okay. Oh man, we gotta do more of these. I'm gonna stomach this,
[1578.42s -> 1589.80s]  I think. I want to do these quizzes. It's the same- oh yeah, it's the same person.
[1590.76s -> 1598.82s]  Who can solve each puzzle the fastest? Bullfrog. Bullfrog. This is imitating a bullfrog.
[1598.82s -> 1602.74s]  Grasp each puzzle piece with the A button on the Wii mode and release them on the puzzle
[1602.74s -> 1611.46s]  outline to complete the picture. To complete the puzzle. Um, are we doing it together?
[1620.09s -> 1625.78s]  It's one of these. You gotta be fucking kidding me. Hey, hey, hey, move, move, move. Get out of my way.
[1636.04s -> 1654.74s]  Oh, I won. I'm first place. Uh, fuck. Some of these are baits. Some of these are baits.
[1655.46s -> 1665.35s]  I just fucking had that one. Oh, he saw me do that. He saw me pick that one up and he was like,
[1665.35s -> 1688.81s]  oh I'm gonna get that one too. Oh. Oh, we don't even finish it. Has he seen that picture?
[1689.53s -> 1700.18s]  I have not. Yes, I have. I have seen that picture. We've seen- this picture props back up like every
[1700.18s -> 1708.95s]  three or four months. I have seen it. I've seen it. Turn your light up. It's scary.
[1722.98s -> 1730.15s]  That better? All right, made it to the party. For each weight comparison, determine which drink is
[1730.15s -> 1762.31s]  the heaviest. Okay, I have to- what? Oh, it's- oh. Oh, okay. I get it. What? Got it. Speed. Oh,
[1762.87s -> 1827.59s]  sorry. They're so far behind. You idiot. Easy. Pretty close. That's fucking cursed. Are we at a casino?
[1834.79s -> 1840.57s]  Blackjack? Who can collect casino chips the fastest? Point at each falling chip with the
[1840.57s -> 1855.66s]  Wii mode. This is not- you can't even code in like a simple Blackjack game. This is- this is moronic.
[1856.54s -> 1881.93s]  This makes me want to scream. I don't know why. Like, the way I have to move and the way that
[1881.93s -> 1888.95s]  it's looking, I think I have to scream. Anybody ever get like that? I don't know why. Just like,
[1888.95s -> 1893.51s]  something about this whole package is like, like I want to just fucking move and scream.
[1894.23s -> 1907.59s]  I don't know what it is. The webcam's not showing the Wii mode. I'm playing on the Wii.
[1909.08s -> 1912.17s]  Like, yeah, you need to be able to see this information. You know what I mean? Like,
[1912.17s -> 1927.62s]  what am I, a bad fucking screamer? Okay, you can see now, right? Okay. Who can bake a souffle the
[1927.62s -> 1932.70s]  fastest? All right, so hold the A button on the Wii mode to keep the needle inside the goal. It's
[1932.70s -> 1957.66s]  just the same game that we've done three times. This is the quickest way to fuck up any food in
[1957.66s -> 1966.06s]  your oven. Oh hey, um, honey, could you preheat the oven to 200 degrees and then turn it up to 500?
[1966.06s -> 1971.02s]  And then after two minutes put it down to 100? And then put it to 700? And then put it at 300?
[1979.10s -> 1987.29s]  Sure, what are you trying to make? Um, diarrhea tomorrow morning. Oh, okay, sure, I'll get right
[1987.29s -> 2007.18s]  on that. One-on-one. Rapidly changing temperature. One-on-one date. He's arrived. Who's it for?
[2007.74s -> 2025.32s]  Oh, it's gonna be this guy. Why not take a short rest here before continuing with the date?
[2025.32s -> 2030.47s]  Short rest? It's a beautiful sunny day after all. Is this the way the game's waiting to be telling
[2030.47s -> 2036.39s]  me to not play anymore? Nintendo Wii always did this. It really did not. It was so concerned about
[2036.39s -> 2045.54s]  you getting up and leaving. It's been 30 minutes. Get up. Stop moving. You should sit down and
[2045.54s -> 2065.83s]  read a book for a while and then come back. 20 minutes. Why not get the outline of each
[2065.83s -> 2070.15s]  image with the weave mode and just press A to start tracing? You're gonna trace every
[2070.15s -> 2079.83s]  nature image on the left side of the screen as fast as you can. I'm gonna have like shaky hands.
[2085.43s -> 2103.21s]  What? Why is it zapping me? I thought I could cheat. I thought I could cheat. I can't cheat.
[2156.09s -> 2191.13s]  I have to scream. I can't breathe. Can somebody with like ADHD do this? This is like suffocating
[2191.13s -> 2275.37s]  them. No, don't show them kissing. I win again. Oh no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
[2275.37s -> 2281.43s]  too big. Too big and too bright. Too big and too bright. Too big and too bright. Too big and too
[2281.43s -> 2285.43s]  bright. Too big and too bright. I looked at that. I saw that in the rear view mirror thing and then
[2285.43s -> 2291.03s]  nope. Whatever. That's the- no it's not- I know it's gonna be one of the- it's gonna be one of those
[2291.03s -> 2294.95s]  things where I see that image on the top. The first thing when you type in German on 85 it's
[2294.95s -> 2304.70s]  that face where I'm going like and ohhh. I'm not going back. Yeah there's no going back.
[2304.70s -> 2311.34s]  No going back. No going back. There's no going back. There's no going back. I- I- I- I- yeah
[2311.34s -> 2322.12s]  yeah I'm just not going back. I just look like a fucking idiot. Look at fucking Bob's Burgers
[2322.12s -> 2349.83s]  character. Hey I got the rose. It's all that matters. I know it wasn't easy but I'd like
[2349.83s -> 2355.59s]  to congratulate you on making it through. All right what personality- what personality quiz
[2355.59s -> 2361.27s]  that I unlocked now? Right you got the money matters quiz. This is the real reason for this
[2361.27s -> 2368.87s]  game being streamed. You know that right? I could give a fuck less about everything happening here.
[2369.75s -> 2381.91s]  When we do this I care about this. I don't care about anything. I have this. I care about that.
[2382.87s -> 2390.33s]  For me you could be streaming Doki Doki. I could also not be streaming Doki Doki which
[2390.33s -> 2400.39s]  is what I'm currently doing. Oh they're models. Who will be the first to get dressed? Memorize
[2400.39s -> 2406.42s]  the position of each fashion item. You receive a random color. Oh it's just okay it's only two.
[2407.14s -> 2413.02s]  You receive a random color. Point at any draw with the wii remote and press the A button to reveal
[2413.02s -> 2460.68s]  items matching your color. Memorize the position of each fashion item. Oh no the hat is- no!
[2467.46s -> 2475.96s]  Holy shit how did he do so bad? How did he do so bad? I can't believe he lost.
[2483.32s -> 2489.21s]  You waved what? You sat like you're in a casket.
[2498.49s -> 2499.69s]  What does that even mean?
[2503.91s -> 2514.15s]  I know I know exactly what you're talking about.
[2514.71s -> 2554.95s]  Like the puzzle thing. Oh this sucks. Okay here we go. Give me that. Too slow. Too slow. Idiot.
[2578.97s -> 2582.41s]  This guy's getting so badly destroyed. It's embarrassing.
[2583.69s -> 2588.54s]  I just need one more. Let's let him get one. No don't let him get one. Fuck him.
[2596.50s -> 2600.26s]  Notice that I drink. I notice that I drink shit weird when I'm on camera.
[2601.69s -> 2604.49s]  It's like I'm pretending to drink it a way that I don't typically drink it.
[2605.53s -> 2609.37s]  Let's- let's get- let's pull like the cover off this and I'm gonna drink that the way that I
[2609.37s -> 2613.05s]  normally would if I was just sitting here normally. I don't know what- here we go. Ready?
[2614.01s -> 2629.59s]  Okay that was normal. What I've been doing is stuff like this. I don't know why. Like you know
[2629.59s -> 2633.35s]  that when you're like con- self-conscious about the way you're drinking out of a can of soda.
[2634.23s -> 2644.34s]  It's time to take a bath. Oh can we pick up some coins?
[2647.16s -> 2657.86s]  Mystery photos. I love this one. Where was this picture taken? Highway, hotel entrance, concert.
[2657.86s -> 2669.22s]  Concert. Hotel entrance. We both got it wrong. This makes no sense. Where was this picture taken?
[2669.86s -> 2678.73s]  Casino. I immediately know. Definitely. What color is the contestants dress?
[2683.26s -> 2699.46s]  White. Yep. What is this person holding? Playing cards. Pretty good hand. The spectators are waiting
[2699.46s -> 2702.74s]  for a ticket, holding lighters in the air, watching a movie, holding their hands in the air.
[2711.08s -> 2718.23s]  Holding their hands in the air. One more. How many female contestants are at this table?
[2728.94s -> 2734.38s]  How would you- how would you even know- how- there's no way to- a couple in this picture is
[2734.38s -> 2739.64s]  sitting on a couch in a plane in a movie theater on a park bench on a couch. Nice one. Couldn't
[2739.64s -> 2751.34s]  even just- this is five blobs at that table. The computer's good at one thing. I thought that was
[2751.34s -> 2779.40s]  a dog. Zero. Holy shit. Not good. I did it again. All right that's just- that's just like a Photoshop
[2779.40s -> 2784.68s]  where you just like push my mouth up and like spread my nose up top. That's funny. It's funny.
[2785.32s -> 2800.60s]  It is. Who can- oh! Who can trace every beach image the fastest? I have to do it like this.
[2851.21s -> 2891.58s]  I'm not kidding. I swear to god. I fucking hate those. You have to breathe.
[2897.83s -> 2902.78s]  Move the sensor further away. No, not that I do the sensor. I have to do it like-
[2902.78s -> 2917.64s]  I've already clicked this image. I've already- I've seen- I've seen it.
[2921.69s -> 2925.53s]  Okay I haven't seen that one. I have not- okay this one's a little different. This one's-
[2926.49s -> 2952.26s]  I feel like I can make this face. That's fucking terrifying. This is what I feel like people that
[2952.26s -> 2963.45s]  are trying to kill me and my dreams look like. That's the image that you see. It's like not a
[2963.45s -> 2970.39s]  human but it is a human and they're like walking with it like erratically with their fucking
[2970.39s -> 2979.37s]  shoulders and shit and they like have something like a like a trophy in their hand. That was the
[2979.37s -> 2991.88s]  wrong thing. Hold on. Wait. Hold on. Wait. Hold on. Wait. Hold on. Wait. Hold on. Wait. Hold on. Wait.
[2992.44s -> 3005.19s]  Hold on. Wait. Hold on. Wait. Hold on. Wait. Hold on. Wait. Where am I? Okay. Zero hearts. Fucking loser.
[3008.02s -> 3028.82s]  A 1-0. Who is it for? The guy with zero or the guy with 48? Let's try Simon.
[3039.91s -> 3043.83s]  I just looked over and saw the guy with the fucking like golf trophy about to kill me.
[3045.11s -> 3053.83s]  If I ever need to settle you guys down, I just have to press that button.
[3054.39s -> 3059.62s]  All right. We're in the hottest restaurant in town. Drinking some red wine.
[3060.26s -> 3070.95s]  Did you find that in your food? Did we complain? Wow. Holy shit. You just- that's like- that was
[3070.95s -> 3106.04s]  like her grandparents' locket. This is a hexagon minigame. Bang right there. Don't get greedy.
[3133.72s -> 3141.11s]  Wait. And go. It's not gonna hit it. Check this out. It's gonna bounce.
[3141.75s -> 3166.65s]  Too late. Got it. Oh. I'm winning by a lot. Hopefully we find the locket that's on the ground.
[3167.45s -> 3197.45s]  That's it. Game over. I win. All that to climb under here. Did somebody pay for it? I don't know
[3197.45s -> 3203.06s]  why but for some reason didn't- didn't- did anybody else want them like just to go up there and to go
[3204.76s -> 3210.60s]  like blow into each other's mouths? Am I the only one that like thought- saw that happening?
[3215.64s -> 3233.22s]  No? Are you sure? I won the whole thing. Where's the road?
[3239.40s -> 3248.97s]  There's no one that contested. They're all gone. Is it the guy that got zero points and that didn't
[3248.97s -> 3266.14s]  just blow into the girl's mouth? We're getting married. From a fucking game show. From a fucking
[3266.14s -> 3286.55s]  game show. Oh we didn't get one extra one. We didn't get an extra one. There's no extra one.
[3287.11s -> 3295.38s]  I'm Chris Harrison from everyone here at the Bachelorette. Good night. And that's a wrap.
[3295.38s -> 3301.59s]  All right get the fuck away from me. Oh you- you've smelled so bad this entire fucking game show.
[3301.59s -> 3306.73s]  Yeah whatever. The rose you had. Fucking- wasn't even real rose. Plastic? We're giving plastic roses?
[3307.61s -> 3318.36s]  So wait I- so I get- I got married. Okay love test. All right it's time. It's time to do- to do these.
[3319.16s -> 3326.31s]  Let's do it. Personality quiz. Let's act- I'm gonna answer this as truthfully as I can.
[3327.03s -> 3332.90s]  How do you make a first impression on a date? If I- okay if it was me and it was real.
[3337.16s -> 3345.58s]  And it's- it would never be A. Ever. It would be B. Like hey how are you? Hello. Just saying hello.
[3345.58s -> 3351.74s]  Well that's terrible. Does love at first sight really exist? Of course I have that effect on
[3351.74s -> 3358.22s]  other people. It's romantic but hard to take that seriously. No it's a cliche that only happens in
[3358.22s -> 3363.58s]  movies. Yes I believe it exists. It's romantic but you- I don't take that very seriously.
[3363.58s -> 3369.58s]  Your date shows up at the door. What's the first thing you look at? Their body, their eyes,
[3369.58s -> 3383.80s]  their shoes, their smile. Just like hey good good to see you. Oh yeah uh hey hey Carol.
[3390.54s -> 3396.70s]  It's it's it's like it's it's like one of these. It's like there. How do you feel about blind dates?
[3396.70s -> 3406.34s]  How do I feel about blind dates? Why? I don't even need to answer this. Hey I know somebody
[3406.34s -> 3415.43s]  that you might like. Oh cool. What do they like? Fuck you. Just go on a date loser. Oh and you did
[3415.43s -> 3425.83s]  this to the other person. So two people have been told hey I know somebody that's single. You should
[3425.83s -> 3434.25s]  you should you should go on a date with them tomorrow. Go and like go to like a nice place
[3434.25s -> 3438.49s]  so you're like you get nervous when you eat the food. We've already gone over this shit.
[3439.64s -> 3445.48s]  All right I can arrange my own dates thank you very much. A. They're fine as long as other people
[3445.48s -> 3451.08s]  as the other person is my type. But I like to know the person before going out with them. Okay
[3451.08s -> 3464.23s]  I think they're sweet. That's how my parents met. It's it's a it's a it's a I like um I'm
[3465.03s -> 3471.80s]  I feel like I'm like just getting set up on like a blind date. You don't even know who the fuck you
[3471.80s -> 3476.28s]  are or who you are or who you're talking to. It's almost like you get like dropped off at school by
[3476.28s -> 3492.63s]  mom. Like your first day of school. Okay have a fun time. Okay mom. Is it you? Jen? Jen? Jeremy?
[3492.63s -> 3507.50s]  Oh you? No not right person. Oh neck. What's wrong with my neck? How do you feel about blind
[3507.50s -> 3511.82s]  dates? I can arrange my own dates thank you very much. Where would you prefer to spend your date?
[3511.82s -> 3515.66s]  Would you rather be at a fancy restaurant? I like a bit of class. Coffee shop but like a good
[3515.66s -> 3520.22s]  conversation. At the movies I like the familiarity. At the park I like holding hands.
[3524.60s -> 3529.48s]  It would probably it's coffee's easy. Coffee's the best. But movies actually is the correct answer
[3529.48s -> 3537.58s]  here. You go to the movie. There is a long archived conversation about what you do on a date
[3538.22s -> 3541.42s]  from personal advice from germa985.
[3542.22s -> 3552.15s]  Conversation should you avoid most on the first date? What topic should you avoid the most? Your
[3552.15s -> 3562.78s]  ex? That's terrible. Politics? That's also terrible. First date? I need to know first of all before we
[3562.78s -> 3568.22s]  go in before we even see the appetizer menu. Are you a democrat or a republican?
[3569.42s -> 3574.86s]  Oh oh that was not the response I was looking for. Okay we don't have to talk about the politics.
[3574.86s -> 3583.45s]  Okay settle down. Do you want me to go? Okay I'll go. I'll go. How much you hate your job
[3589.83s -> 3610.68s]  dating a car? There's a car in the restaurant where they sit at the table and you're across from the
[3610.68s -> 3620.18s]  car. All right don't talk about politics. Religion it's not terrible because you can just be like
[3620.18s -> 3624.90s]  man like how did we really get here and people fucking talk like that all the time. Don't talk
[3624.90s -> 3630.74s]  about politics. You're coming to the end of a great first date and there's definitely some chemistry.
[3631.30s -> 3635.78s]  Do you move in for the kiss? Okay you're coming to the end of a great first date and there's
[3635.78s -> 3640.50s]  definitely some chemistry. Do you move in for the kiss? I can't. I never make the first move. I'd
[3640.50s -> 3644.34s]  want to but the other person has to feel it too. Not on the first date. It wouldn't be appropriate.
[3644.34s -> 3651.13s]  Both of us make the first move at the same time. How does that work? Is it like...
[3651.13s -> 3771.61s]  Okay no wait wait wait hold on. I need to I gotta get this. I think I broke it. I think I'm breaking
[3771.61s -> 3790.25s]  my stream. Holy shit this is so delayed. This is fucked up. I yeah I broke it. Oh it's because I
[3790.25s -> 3796.09s]  don't have two cameras right. Hold on. Yes I do. No I don't. Yes I do. Hold on. This is worth it.
[3796.09s -> 3804.30s]  Trust me. Go to the bathroom for a minute. It's because you can't do it with the same camera. I
[3804.30s -> 3830.71s]  gotta get my reference cam. It becomes a five minute joke. Maybe I can do it. Hold on. I think
[3830.71s -> 3854.95s]  I can do it. Let's see. Shit. The other camera's not here. Damn it. It's not here and it's not
[3854.95s -> 3879.08s]  possible to get. Fuck. You know what I was going to do. Shit. There's no other way I can do this.
[3879.64s -> 3916.01s]  Is there no other way? There's no other way. Oh I'm sad. Damn it. Print out a picture.
[3916.33s -> 3923.29s]  Oh yeah I gotta have two cameras here. Oh it's disappointing when you can't capitalize on a
[3923.29s -> 3931.45s]  fucking potential plus two point of the stream. All right what. Oh none of the first date.
[3932.73s -> 3937.45s]  Both of us. We make them over the same time. Your date is 20 minutes late and there's still
[3937.45s -> 3942.17s]  no sign of them in the restaurant. You call but there's no answer. What do you do?
[3943.05s -> 3959.29s]  I'm gonna go home. I'll wait around for five more minutes but that's it. Call again. Maybe this time
[3959.29s -> 3964.33s]  it'll get through. I'm staying here. Something must have happened. I'm going home. You're out on a
[3964.33s -> 3970.42s]  first date but the two of you just don't click. It's getting late and you'd rather leave. You end
[3970.42s -> 3976.70s]  the date. That's really easy to make up a lie and leave. Tell them honestly thank them. Have a friend
[3976.70s -> 3984.66s]  call them and bail me out. I just go through with the rest of the date. Yeah you know you just say
[3984.66s -> 3995.13s]  uh it's uh hello hello what is this oh no way oh you're in town you're in town for just the next
[3995.13s -> 4004.25s]  two hours oh yo shit oh i'm so that's crazy i'll have to catch you i'll have to catch you
[4005.45s -> 4012.73s]  okay see you soon bye by the way that's what i was doing not with a real phone going like this

[4051.93s -> 4056.57s]  spirit happy and carefree you enjoy meeting new people and take everything in stride
[4056.57s -> 4060.33s]  you might be a bit cautious when it comes to love and you definitely believe in its power
[4061.13s -> 4068.26s]  wow we got more of these to do you're walking along the beach when you come across a dog with

[4116.62s -> 4125.22s]  street this is seat you've got to have good communication what's the best way to cheer them

[4316.68s -> 4328.01s]  creighton barrel this guy saw like fucking 15 movies in the last like three days it would be
[4328.01s -> 4330.57s]  one of these three so i i don't and i don't know which one of these because a different
[4330.57s -> 4340.18s]  scenario every time so we're gonna go like this after the office party is about to drive home
[4340.18s -> 4346.28s]  but he seems a bit tipsy what do you do let him go he's probably fine ask him if he's okay take
[4346.28s -> 4355.16s]  away his keys you call cap get a cap or like if you figure out who's there then you say hey like
[4355.16s -> 4362.78s]  i i haven't had anything to drink i'll drive your car you do you drive you know get get a cap get a
[4362.78s -> 4375.64s]  lift it'll be a cap you can come back to you can come back and your car is not going to get
[4375.64s -> 4379.32s]  you're not going to you're not going to trouble get a cap get a lift one day when your parents
[4379.32s -> 4384.68s]  become too old to take care of themselves you will ask my other relatives to deal with it
[4384.68s -> 4388.92s]  have them move in with me put them in a retirement home visit them every day this is this is
[4388.92s -> 4402.28s]  unrealistic uh i don't i don't like any of these visit them every day that's i'm not i can't i'm
[4402.28s -> 4411.74s]  not gonna do that i don't want to do that but i mean what if they want to do that i got other i
[4411.74s -> 4416.30s]  got siblings that are way smarter than me in every single facet of life every single one
[4417.10s -> 4422.55s]  do you find yourself filled with a sense of joy and happiness during the holiday season
[4423.99s -> 4428.87s]  not really am i supposed to yeah i think so must be all the gift-giving well lately it's become
[4428.87s -> 4434.39s]  more hectic and busy absolutely my favorite time i think so i think i feel all right during the
[4434.39s -> 4440.79s]  holidays those who fight constantly have forgotten how to express affection do you agree those who
[4440.79s -> 4445.83s]  fight constantly have forgotten how to express affection that's obvious who likes fighting i
[4445.83s -> 4449.75s]  would agree that being caring and affectionate takes practice not fighting doesn't necessarily
[4449.75s -> 4453.59s]  mean you don't have problems i don't completely agree but fighting certainly doesn't help
[4464.04s -> 4474.15s]  i mean it's probably i would say probably d for me i mean these all could be accurate c but not
[4474.15s -> 4479.94s]  fighting doesn't necessarily mean you don't have problems i don't know it's what are we talking
[4479.94s -> 4489.21s]  about like fighting like what does that mean that's obvious who likes fighting i mean it doesn't i
[4491.24s -> 4498.74s]  fist fight it's not what that that's incorrect not combat it's not combat now fighting doesn't
[4498.74s -> 4506.04s]  help but i don't know it's i don't know i don't know what they mean you're the teddy bear you are
[4506.04s -> 4511.48s]  a walking hug always putting others before yourself your actions are genuine and ever selfish watch
[4511.48s -> 4519.34s]  out for those who might take advantage of your sweet side i wanted i thought i wanted to get
[4519.34s -> 4524.87s]  like the bull you know what i mean the teddy bear that's not accurate money matters after a dinner
[4525.67s -> 4526.31s]  pays the bill
[4535.74s -> 4543.19s]  oh look honey i'm worth it imagine saying that had like a first date or a second date imagine
[4543.19s -> 4551.59s]  how much of a fucking psycho you would have to be oh here comes the bill oh okay so uh look i'm
[4551.59s -> 4565.90s]  worth it that would be like a instantly leaving the restaurant uh i initiated the date i'll pay
[4566.38s -> 4572.71s]  it is the money and the relationship somebody's got to do it but it won't be me times have changed
[4572.71s -> 4576.07s]  people need to be aware of their money situation the person who is more financially competent in
[4576.07s -> 4587.08s]  such matters if you're rich i don't see a problem why is everybody automatically saying this is d
[4587.08s -> 4611.00s]  for me this is me people have to be aware of their money situation you got to be aware
[4612.28s -> 4616.36s]  are you okay with you if your partner makes more money than you okay with that more than okay that's
[4616.36s -> 4623.37s]  how i support my lifestyle uh it wouldn't feel that i was doing my equal share depends on how
[4623.37s -> 4627.21s]  much it depends by how much and if i was able to earn more if it doesn't affect my relationship
[4627.21s -> 4636.20s]  then i'm fine with it now if it doesn't affect the relationship though i don't care what do i care
[4638.07s -> 4647.99s]  if money can't buy me love what can it buy uh education security freedom uh it's one of these
[4647.99s -> 4658.49s]  two education is fucking expensive yeah educate what is it what is it how how much does it cost
[4658.49s -> 4669.18s]  to go to school now like 489 000 but having a bunch of money to go to like to like not worry
[4669.18s -> 4678.15s]  about school um gives you security it's security it's been said a person's wealth is not always
[4678.15s -> 4683.18s]  a reflection of what they have what does that mean it means don't be fooled by someone who
[4683.18s -> 4686.38s]  looks rich it means that happiness is not always linked to money it means you can make a lot of
[4686.38s -> 4694.58s]  money but still owe a lot it means they're not spending enough it means that happiness is not
[4694.58s -> 4698.66s]  always linked to money that's what the saying means after checking your bank account you
[4698.66s -> 4703.38s]  discovered your spouse has been making a lot of expensive purchases lately how do you feel
[4704.18s -> 4707.70s]  no big deal people should live a little angry we need to talk about this are these purchases
[4707.70s -> 4721.98s]  made out of necessity that's the idea you're sharing a life together i mean this is probably
[4721.98s -> 4725.82s]  the like it would be like what it would be like what what did you buy like what is this
[4727.30s -> 4734.38s]  are we talking about like you bought there's a lot of different kinds of expensive purchases
[4734.94s -> 4745.21s]  did you buy a expensive bracelet or a jumpy house because one of those things is a little
[4745.21s -> 4755.42s]  bit different than the other i mean i don't know i'd be like that way i'd be like why'd you buy a
[4755.42s -> 4767.08s]  jumpy house i'd be fucking really happy about it so that uh not a big deal you've met someone new
[4767.08s -> 4772.28s]  and everything is going well until you find out they're actually in heavy debt does this affect
[4772.28s -> 4776.60s]  your relationship definitely how can i expect them to take care of me i'd continue seeing the
[4776.60s -> 4781.08s]  person but this is a warning sign difficult to see myself with such an irresponsible partner
[4781.80s -> 4795.70s]  everybody has debts nobody's perfect i have a heavy debt i mean it's it's either b or d
[4795.70s -> 4801.16s]  but what does that happen like it's okay you met it you met someone new and everything is going
[4801.16s -> 4806.04s]  well until it's almost like they're scratching out until it's like until the rest of this is
[4806.04s -> 4810.84s]  scratched out they ask for you to pay for all their credit card bills and all the loans they have
[4810.84s -> 4820.62s]  it's like that what doesn't all of this i mean it's it's probably like d or like b
[4822.84s -> 4827.96s]  but if it's student debt everybody has fucking debt whatever how would you feel if your spouse
[4827.96s -> 4840.18s]  couldn't complete their own income taxes and is incapable of filing a report you lose your job
[4840.18s -> 4847.22s]  while your family relies on you as the primary source of income how do you feel i i pay some i
[4847.22s -> 4855.05s]  i got a cpa that does that for me i got no idea what the fuck i'm doing i got a cpa that goes
[4855.05s -> 4864.73s]  over the whole books i don't i don't you lose your job while your family relies on you as a primary
[4864.73s -> 4870.18s]  source of income how do you feel uh i'll get another job so what i feel like i let them down
[4870.18s -> 4884.82s]  i'm not worried that's why we have savings um it probably bothered me a little bit that probably
[4884.82s -> 4890.74s]  i'd probably get i'd be like uh oh shit i mean if i would hopefully have some savings
[4895.16s -> 4898.92s]  i mean if you if i lose my job if i lost my job i would i feel like shit like that's like it's

[4914.84s -> 4923.37s]  loved ones luxury i don't like living poor modestly a life without intimacy isn't worth it
