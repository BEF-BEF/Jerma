[8.44s -> 15.61s]  Okay, I am back and I am ready to play some Armored Core.
[15.61s -> 23.05s]  Somebody asked, is this your first Armored Core game? The answer is yes.
[23.05s -> 30.04s]  And I know. Don't play it like Dark Souls. I know they made this game. Don't play it like Dark Souls.
[30.04s -> 35.16s]  I know you're going to try and you're going to get frustrated. I promise I will not.
[35.16s -> 49.61s]  How does this look? So this is a controller game, right?
[49.61s -> 58.14s]  Everything I've read that this is a controller game. I still want to beat Final Fantasy 16.
[58.14s -> 68.12s]  I don't know what made me think of that. Oh no, my headphone plug is messed up.
[68.12s -> 76.29s]  Okay, keyboard is better. Controller, controller. I don't know. Let's try it.
[76.29s -> 92.61s]  Okay, let me see. Can you see it? You should see it.
[92.61s -> 103.92s]  Hey, there it is. I'm not playing online. I figured that's probably not.
[103.92s -> 111.02s]  I usually don't play any of these games online. Alright, new game.
[111.02s -> 123.94s]  That looks good. That's fine. Okay, that's fine.
[123.94s -> 142.62s]  Pilot name. I want it to be a surprise. I'm going to make sure you don't see it.
[142.62s -> 166.61s]  Because I want it to be a surprise. It's probably a cutscene.
[166.61s -> 179.60s]  Am I going to like this game? It's eating a lot of nos.
[179.60s -> 205.39s]  Open mind. Open mind, guys. Come on.
[205.39s -> 221.01s]  More Sekiro than Souls. It's very loud. You are so fucked, dude.
[221.01s -> 232.46s]  Yeah, I've heard all the people compare it. This is what I've been told.
[232.46s -> 238.46s]  This is a different video game. This is not a Souls game.
[238.46s -> 247.03s]  So I'm going to treat it like a completely different video game.
[247.03s -> 254.98s]  It's a completely different franchise. It doesn't have that From Software crispiness.
[254.98s -> 271.32s]  That we're all used to. Let's find out.
[271.32s -> 290.23s]  Looks really good.
[290.23s -> 299.18s]  Okay. Commence mission. Yep, move.
[299.18s -> 308.52s]  That feels fun to play.
[308.52s -> 314.49s]  Okay, so it's a toggle.
[314.49s -> 320.01s]  And that's a jump. And you hold to go up.
[320.01s -> 326.98s]  Got it.
[326.98s -> 337.86s]  How do I turn the gas off?
[337.86s -> 342.23s]  Okay.
[342.23s -> 346.23s]  Oh.
[346.23s -> 366.49s]  What's wrong with my weapon?
[366.49s -> 378.02s]  How do I reload? Is there a manual reload?
[378.02s -> 382.02s]  Okay.
[382.02s -> 386.39s]  Okay, so it's lock on.
[386.39s -> 391.46s]  Yeah, lock on. Got it.
[391.46s -> 396.34s]  Hold on.
[396.34s -> 409.66s]  I get it.
[420.14s -> 428.09s]  Okay.
[428.09s -> 447.59s]  Okay, so hold this.
[447.59s -> 453.37s]  Whoa. Okay, that's a slash.
[453.37s -> 466.23s]  Do I have anything on left bumper?
[466.23s -> 470.23s]  Okay.
[474.79s -> 481.34s]  Okay.
[481.34s -> 491.05s]  What is that?
[491.05s -> 514.41s]  It just started moving. It kind of just started moving on its own.
[514.41s -> 524.28s]  Rollercoaster tracks?
[524.28s -> 531.59s]  I'm sorry. I couldn't see what you wrote. You were banned.
[531.59s -> 556.73s]  I can't read your message. Something with it.
[556.73s -> 566.07s]  Okay. I get it so far.
[566.07s -> 580.26s]  Okay.
[580.26s -> 584.50s]  Quick boost. Instantly accelerate in any direction, helping you to evade attacks or swiftly close in.
[584.50s -> 614.66s]  Alright, so it's X as a dash.
[614.66s -> 623.90s]  Cool. I think a lot of people thought I was going to die there, so I win.
[623.90s -> 629.54s]  It doesn't seem like there is a map.
[629.54s -> 633.91s]  Okay.
[633.91s -> 637.91s]  Oh, that's what happened. Okay.
[637.91s -> 653.35s]  That's what happened last time. I was like, why am I moving automatically?
[653.35s -> 668.44s]  Let's go. Alright. Gotta make it all the way over there.
[668.44s -> 702.25s]  I've never played any of these games before. No, not as of until right now.
[702.25s -> 712.41s]  Fun. Okay. There's no timer or anything, right?
[712.41s -> 722.33s]  No, there's not. He did play Metal Wolf. I did play Metal Wolf. It's true.
[722.33s -> 757.90s]  Oh, shit. I'm out of gas. How do I turn the gas off?
[757.90s -> 767.30s]  It's B? Okay. Yep. That's my favorite move so far. I like that one a lot.
[767.30s -> 787.34s]  The normal boost does not drain energy. That's good to know.
[787.34s -> 791.64s]  Okay. License code Monkey Gordo. License code extracted from an AC wreck
[791.64s -> 796.78s]  in the contaminated city. Contains the pilot's registration data.
[796.78s -> 822.44s]  Cool. So this is essentially a fast travel.
[822.44s -> 830.18s]  No, it's a salt boost. Right, right. You know what I mean.
[830.18s -> 835.58s]  Does everything reload automatically?
[835.58s -> 849.51s]  Yes. Alright, good. That's all I needed to know.
[849.51s -> 858.60s]  Alright, where we at? Down there. You can also reload it faster.
[858.60s -> 867.96s]  You can manually reload the rifle.
[867.96s -> 875.51s]  G7 Chakra. License expires in 12 hours.
[875.51s -> 898.66s]  I like the flying.
[898.66s -> 910.89s]  License expired. Somebody said you should
[910.89s -> 916.60s]  use the B type control scheme. It's way better. Is it?
[916.60s -> 932.68s]  I feel like I could get used to this. It's just personal preference.
[932.68s -> 942.79s]  Type B. Quick boost is right trigger.
[942.79s -> 948.06s]  A is boost. I think they're the same.
[948.06s -> 953.16s]  Okay. No, I much prefer it like this.
[953.16s -> 965.83s]  All the trigger buttons are weapons to me.
[965.83s -> 984.89s]  Alright, where am I going? Can I upgrade that?
[984.89s -> 1011.13s]  First thing I'm upgrading. I want that to last much longer.
[1011.13s -> 1018.76s]  Oh, shit. That's a bad idea. It's all about moving, moving, moving, moving, moving.
[1018.76s -> 1029.51s]  30%. That's it? I didn't know that was ammo.
[1029.51s -> 1043.74s]  Are you going to get filtered by this game so hard?
[1043.74s -> 1048.04s]  What does that mean? I've not heard that term before. That's a new
[1048.04s -> 1052.04s]  From Software Armored Core 6 term that you're using. What is that?
[1052.04s -> 1068.87s]  You're going to get filtered. What does that mean?
[1068.87s -> 1072.87s]  Does that mean that I cannot? There's like a gamer filter on this game
[1072.87s -> 1077.24s]  where it filters out all the non-gamers because what if I can't beat the first
[1077.24s -> 1091.50s]  boss and I get filtered? Is that what it means?
[1091.50s -> 1095.80s]  I haven't even gotten through the tutorial yet. You guys are already
[1095.80s -> 1101.06s]  saying things that are going to happen on this stream before they've even happened.
[1101.06s -> 1118.28s]  You've already placed the bets already. I'm going to do just fine.
[1118.28s -> 1139.40s]  Vertical catapult. This game is harder than Elden Ring. I'm sure it probably
[1139.40s -> 1152.66s]  has a different category. Here comes the first tutorial boss.
[1152.66s -> 1159.66s]  I'm going to get filtered because I'm not good enough. This is definitely a boss
[1159.66s -> 1169.59s]  area. Look at it. Does it make the From Software bird noise though?
[1169.59s -> 1197.05s]  That's the main question. That sounds like the TikTok
[1197.05s -> 1203.14s]  filter. That sounds like the guy on TikTok that's the TTF.
[1203.14s -> 1262.78s]  I got filtered.
[1262.78s -> 1288.60s]  I get it. I'll get it this time. I got three heals now.
[1288.60s -> 1313.05s]  Here we go. It's all about getting up close. I got it. I got it. I got it.
[1313.05s -> 1362.63s]  Damn it. It's alright. Back it up. I'm alright.
[1362.63s -> 1433.02s]  I'm fine.
[1433.02s -> 1456.73s]  Second try. Is that alright? Did I do good? Did I beat it?
[1456.73s -> 1471.32s]  That was fun. Gamers are flipping their desks right now.
[1471.32s -> 1488.28s]  This is a raven? I can see how that would be really
[1488.28s -> 1493.16s]  difficult. You can die in one hit by those bombs if you don't avoid them.
[1493.16s -> 1504.98s]  Chat losing to a retired streamer.
[1504.98s -> 1509.80s]  Just because I'm a little older doesn't mean I still got it sometimes.
[1509.80s -> 1518.50s]  That was enjoyable.
[1518.50s -> 1524.78s]  I had a lot of fun doing that.
[1541.69s -> 1545.69s]  How come you sound so sarcastic?
[1545.69s -> 1551.38s]  Do I? I don't know. I'm just kind of chilling. I don't mean to.
[1568.44s -> 1578.10s]  It's a little low. I'll turn it up.
[1578.10s -> 1583.94s]  The whole point of this game is you upgrade and change out here, right?
[1583.94s -> 1590.54s]  I'm into that part
[1590.54s -> 1594.71s]  for sure.
[1601.06s -> 1613.08s]  You can paint it?
[1613.08s -> 1622.15s]  I took the idea.
[1632.09s -> 1636.63s]  Don't get tied to
[1636.63s -> 1640.63s]  one build. Always change it to adapt.
[1640.63s -> 1645.32s]  Okay.
[1651.32s -> 1655.56s]  Change the title? What is the title right now?
[1655.56s -> 1664.78s]  Design? Okay. Design.
[1664.78s -> 1670.41s]  Assembly. Oh boy, that's a lot of information.
[1670.41s -> 1674.90s]  Customize AC assemblies using the parts you have available at the assembly menu.
[1674.90s -> 1680.41s]  Maximum weight.
[1680.41s -> 1691.53s]  I like this weapon a lot.
[1691.53s -> 1698.63s]  I don't think I can change this. I can take it off.
[1698.63s -> 1708.18s]  Definitely don't want to take it off.
[1708.18s -> 1716.89s]  Oh jeez, that's a lot.
[1716.89s -> 1720.89s]  I'm going to keep it simple for now.
[1720.89s -> 1727.75s]  I can read those numbers at the bottom.
[1727.75s -> 1746.54s]  We'll stick with that.
[1746.54s -> 1753.08s]  I could spend all day here.
[1753.08s -> 1789.86s]  That means I'm angry.
[1789.86s -> 1799.48s]  Decals.
[1799.48s -> 1806.25s]  What do I have for regular decals?
[1806.25s -> 1811.90s]  You can just deck yourself out in a bunch of memes.
[1811.90s -> 1819.24s]  That's kind of fun.
[1819.24s -> 1825.02s]  This is all for another time.
[1825.02s -> 1829.64s]  Create images for use. Manage AC assembly appearance settings.
[1829.64s -> 1835.80s]  Save and load. You can save each one.
[1835.80s -> 1841.74s]  Missions. Training.
[1841.74s -> 1848.71s]  Check incoming jobs and sortie on missions from the missions menu.
[1848.71s -> 1856.73s]  This is $100,000. This is $68,000.
[1856.73s -> 1862.70s]  Destroy artillery installations. Do the training first.
[1862.70s -> 1879.53s]  Land shots on moving enemies.
[1879.53s -> 1883.53s]  You must pull the trigger while they are within lock-on range.
[1883.53s -> 1889.62s]  They have to be in the range.
[1889.62s -> 1919.96s]  They have to be in the circle.
[1919.96s -> 1923.96s]  Weapons with magazines will automatically reload when the magazine's ammunition is depleted.
[1923.96s -> 1927.96s]  Manually reload before engaging the enemy to minimize the risk that your attacks will be interrupted by a reload.
[1927.96s -> 1938.92s]  That's Y plus RT.
[1938.92s -> 1950.90s]  Missile lock.
[1950.90s -> 1957.62s]  To use missiles in other homing rounds, keep the enemy on screen until lock-on completes, then fire.
[1957.62s -> 1963.34s]  Missile weapons are capable of multi-lock.
[1963.34s -> 1973.30s]  You can cancel it.
[1973.30s -> 1991.72s]  Those all went over there.
[1991.72s -> 2000.23s]  Melee weapons.
[2000.23s -> 2017.37s]  You can charge it.
[2017.37s -> 2027.24s]  You have to fill up that meter.
[2027.24s -> 2031.24s]  I'm imagining some stuff does way more stagger damage.
[2031.24s -> 2035.98s]  The machine gun probably doesn't do very much stagger damage.
[2035.98s -> 2045.21s]  There's a Hitman 3 vision mode.
[2045.21s -> 2067.27s]  Melee weapons do a lot of stagger.
[2067.27s -> 2099.83s]  Slashing twice.
[2099.83s -> 2113.42s]  The new machine gun.
[2113.42s -> 2120.28s]  Less attack power.
[2120.28s -> 2130.33s]  I could put it on the other arm.
[2130.33s -> 2138.07s]  The bar is increasing.
[2138.07s -> 2156.30s]  I'll try it.
[2156.30s -> 2170.63s]  Is that it for the training?
[2170.63s -> 2178.62s]  Which one of these is a good mission for me to try?
[2178.62s -> 2200.49s]  Let's go to this one.
[2200.49s -> 2212.07s]  Let's go slowly.
[2235.83s -> 2242.42s]  I like in the middle of that.
[2242.42s -> 2249.03s]  Have a good one.
[2249.03s -> 2253.03s]  Destroy all Rubicon Liberation Front artillery installations.
[2253.03s -> 2271.94s]  I think I'm just good.
[2271.94s -> 2281.86s]  You get more money for more things you kill.
[2281.86s -> 2289.11s]  I'll just fly around and splash some stuff.
[2289.11s -> 2295.91s]  Destroy all the stuff.
[2295.91s -> 2321.51s]  Destroy all the stuff.
[2321.51s -> 2327.72s]  Does time matter?
[2327.72s -> 2365.26s]  Time to finish.
[2365.26s -> 2384.97s]  Watch for the boost.
[2384.97s -> 2395.42s]  Much time is lost.
[2395.42s -> 2400.42s]  Easy.
[2400.42s -> 2423.85s]  This game gets very fun.
[2423.85s -> 2442.87s]  Especially when you upgrade.
[2442.87s -> 2463.22s]  oh excuse me excuse me that's a lot of shit over there all right I gotta be
[2463.22s -> 2468.50s]  careful that's too much stuff all right turn let's chill out for a sec all right
[2468.50s -> 2494.57s]  here we go oh ouch ow ow ow I'm stuck on the fucking thing what's
[2494.57s -> 2546.35s]  happening oh it's a good thought one more that's it right oh all right cool I
[2546.35s -> 2568.59s]  just win 120,000 so the missions are kind of snappy then yeah I that's my
[2568.59s -> 2575.80s]  favorite part about the game so far stuff is just snappy
[2575.80s -> 2581.91s]  registration number RB call sign Raven your return to mercenary activities has
[2581.91s -> 2586.22s]  been acknowledged restoring access to the it's got some from software
[2586.22s -> 2591.90s]  equipment a crisp crispness I can't even talk it does have that from software
[2591.90s -> 2612.62s]  crispness new training I who first rifle and gun sounds kind of fun bazooka
[2612.62s -> 2627.72s]  though all right back power huge on the bazooka Christmas in August honestly I
[2627.72s -> 2635.65s]  feel like that's the kind of weapon I would like to use there's only one how
[2635.65s -> 2657.90s]  many shots is it six seven hundred total rounds 105 I think I'm gonna buy the
[2657.90s -> 2672.70s]  bazooka oh there it is recoil this thing is probably just really good for
[2672.70s -> 2679.76s]  finishing stuff off I'm getting the bazooka well there's so much more all
[2679.76s -> 2685.95s]  right what it wait wait wait I need simplified info first rifle this is the
[2685.95s -> 2691.26s]  other hand the other hand right now has the slash on it I don't know if I want
[2691.26s -> 2702.38s]  to replace that although an assault rifle would be amazing mmm that would be
[2702.38s -> 2722.48s]  good too I think I want this I already have one of these though don't I all
[2722.48s -> 2746.30s]  right we're going bazooka on right hand oh I can't okay no back in it you need
[2746.30s -> 2756.14s]  one for each hand ah okay that makes sense I'm gonna get it I feel like
[2756.14s -> 2759.56s]  having a big bazooka and then having the be able to finish it off with the
[2759.56s -> 2769.20s]  machine gun is good give it a try I don't have a sword anymore but right
[2769.20s -> 2784.32s]  different missile launcher pulse shield another missile oh I can do double
[2784.32s -> 2791.62s]  missile launcher that would be awesome what about the shield what does this do
[2791.62s -> 2802.81s]  okay so just blocks a bunch of it just block all damage or it's a Perry it's
[2802.81s -> 2808.33s]  hard it's Perry I'll just do double missile launcher yeah let's go why not
[2808.33s -> 2830.19s]  this is a left bumper right okay there was some new training which I'm gonna do
[2830.19s -> 2865.64s]  because I want the item charge attacks oh wow okay this thing is disgusting how
[2865.64s -> 2876.50s]  many shots does this have four needs to be reloaded got 12 all right what about
[2876.50s -> 2882.83s]  what happened to my wait a minute what's going on here why is it giving me this
[2882.83s -> 2896.18s]  stuff oh it's gonna teach me how to do this attitude control system of a craft
[2896.18s -> 2899.58s]  can be compromised by accumulating strain from the impact of repeated
[2899.58s -> 2906.22s]  attacks so this is the stagger system so when you get that overloaded you get
[2906.22s -> 2912.43s]  into stagger yep that's what I figured it was doing during which time the
[2912.43s -> 2918.19s]  afflicted craft will be immobilized and susceptible to critical damage so once
[2918.19s -> 2929.68s]  you get that stagger that's when you just unload everything during stagger
[2929.68s -> 2934.08s]  all incoming attacks are treated as direct hits and deal much more damage
[2934.08s -> 2949.18s]  okay so you just there okay how long does it last for not very long honestly
[2949.18s -> 2978.69s]  yeah I think I get it oops uh ACS strain afflicted with it on enemies
[2978.69s -> 2981.89s]  resets after a brief interval but a portion of that strain will remain
[2981.89s -> 2986.49s]  weapons vary in the amount of accumulative strain they inflict with
[2986.49s -> 3010.36s]  explosive impact generally leaving the most okay that's quite the strain so
[3010.36s -> 3022.48s]  this is the boss killer that you need to do this to kill bosses surprise attacks
[3022.48s -> 3027.62s]  acts on enemies that are unaware of your presence will inflict greater strain
[3027.62s -> 3045.61s]  okay so they're off they're unaware of you oh they're not aware it does do a
[3045.61s -> 3062.66s]  lot more shield equipped to the left shoulder can be deployed to reduce
[3062.66s -> 3075.17s]  incoming damage from ACA ACS strain what's the charge on it so you can do
[3075.17s -> 3107.57s]  it pretty much instantly by doing it wrong it overheats shield output is
[3107.57s -> 3112.55s]  maximized for one to two seconds after deployment blocking during the initial
[3112.55s -> 3116.59s]  guard window can help to minimize incoming damage all right so it is a
[3116.59s -> 3156.53s]  parry okay so one two pop I get it cool although I don't have a shield on right
[3156.53s -> 3171.92s]  now they don't take very much damage in the front of their shield oh I skipped
[3171.92s -> 3183.37s]  that shit what did that mean I skipped that what did that say attack while
[3183.37s -> 3199.48s]  assault boosted all right got it yep I think I was doing that before though
[3199.48s -> 3230.18s]  attack well assault boosted gives you more stagger ah linear rifle let's check
[3230.18s -> 3247.71s]  it Oh just the regular rifle other arm though probably right no what is it I'm
[3247.71s -> 3251.22s]  gonna keep what I got that's the tutorial gun it's one you just used in
[3251.22s -> 3255.14s]  store okay I see all the charge one all right I actually really like that but
[3255.14s -> 3289.30s]  we'll test this out for now I like it
[3289.30s -> 3333.98s]  I think it's good it gets better and better down the line missions get better
[3333.98s -> 3338.62s]  and better how many okay so here's a here's a question how many bosses are in
[3338.62s -> 3353.66s]  the game are there like there's a lot cuz I love bosses bosses is my favorite
[3353.66s -> 3356.30s]  part about any of the from software games now I know this is not Dark Souls
[3356.30s -> 3363.04s]  I know I'm that I was told don't do that is a boss battles a big part of this
[3363.04s -> 3394.32s]  game yes okay play the game and find out all right let's go so I got a new weapon
[3394.32s -> 3405.01s]  sure let me can I test it it's one shot and then it reloads what about this one
[3405.01s -> 3412.35s]  it's just a machine gun I got the double launcher now it's just cool let's see
[3412.35s -> 3447.26s]  what happens oh that was a good shot shit I'm trying to hit him with there we
[3447.26s -> 3476.45s]  go all right cool cool cool cool cool cool I like doing the double bomb look
[3476.45s -> 3500.70s]  at that cool all right they come boost is still on wait for reloads let's go
[3500.86s -> 3554.50s]  enemy shields analyzed I can't believe I lost to this oh don't fall anybody else
[3554.50s -> 3589.34s]  oh I did it kind of reminds me of EDF a little bit is that accurate a little bit
[3590.54s -> 3596.46s]  when is the next EDF coming out it's out in Japan right now right
[3602.54s -> 3611.94s]  he's streaming tonight because he wants to advertise the you twos I actually
[3611.94s -> 3616.82s]  haven't even done that thanks for reminding me I just I like thanks for
[3616.82s -> 3628.08s]  the thanks for the reminder access log hunt you've been invited to join log
[3628.08s -> 3644.35s]  hunt one of all mines mercenary support programs okay I got more money and gone
[3644.35s -> 3651.30s]  on the right side now you can do double handgun wait wait wait wait wait wait
[3651.30s -> 3656.81s]  wait wait wait wait what is this pulse shield no I know what that is I can put
[3656.81s -> 3663.94s]  a different head on incorporates only the most essential functionality with a
[3663.94s -> 3669.38s]  minimalist build in keeping with the fangs stout tree slender branches
[3669.38s -> 3684.35s]  philosophy it's really loud light oh Jesus Christ I did not know you oh okay
[3684.35s -> 3701.44s]  it's not just it's everything I get it so you end up making your favorite
[3701.44s -> 3710.50s]  spore monster right you put the legs on you put the arms on okay but most
[3710.50s -> 3716.57s]  importantly what does this do for me right now if I were to do that lose a
[3716.57s -> 3722.60s]  ton of stability lose a ton of recovery lose a bunch of AP I don't think I'm
[3722.60s -> 3736.36s]  gonna mess around with this right now defense and speed press Y on it more
[3736.36s -> 3744.47s]  explosive defense scan duration is up anti-explosive defense speed boost is
[3744.47s -> 3755.75s]  better load better stop overwhelming him it mostly just means light yeah I'm
[3755.75s -> 3768.58s]  not gonna do that right now but I am going to do this I'm going to save my
[3768.58s -> 3782.52s]  money destroy targets destroy enemy AC let's do that transport helicopter one
[3782.52s -> 3797.25s]  the important part is actually the legs you can sell items for the same price
[3797.25s -> 3841.42s]  you bought them for anything you're not using I'm gonna stick with what I got
[3841.42s -> 3847.67s]  okay destroy targets destroy all the Rubicon liberation front logistics
[3847.67s -> 3858.14s]  helicopters I like this game because it's telling me just very direct
[3858.14s -> 3868.25s]  instructions kill that thing with the blue target on it I can do that you've
[3868.25s -> 3874.13s]  given me four buttons and they just kill that thing right there I'm gonna love
[3874.13s -> 3921.75s]  this game whoo very nice all right eat another chopper hang on for a sec you
[3921.75s -> 3958.44s]  watch out hit it yes ready to reload you do not need to change targets for
[3958.44s -> 3975.04s]  the multi lock ah oh I took too much damage there that was stupid all right
[3975.04s -> 3993.22s]  let me wait till my stacker goes down I'd let off steam or something I guess
[3993.22s -> 4048.18s]  flash damage to oops gotta go in the air oh oh all right I'm starting I'm getting
[4048.18s -> 4091.07s]  to feel for it I understand what's going on I think it's really hard damn all
[4091.07s -> 4121.99s]  right that wasn't even the target that was optional oh it's fun cool combat
[4121.99s -> 4129.09s]  logs give parts should I be looking for those I feel like I haven't scanned the
[4129.09s -> 4156.25s]  game once that's a new menu optional mini bosses like that give you logs got
[4156.25s -> 4182.46s]  you training I like that yeah I like you can replay missions as many times as you
[4182.46s -> 4200.70s]  want that's a good feature this might be really stupid but I'm kind of into it
[4200.70s -> 4227.99s]  I'm doing double bazooka I would probably use this very well the missiles
[4227.99s -> 4237.63s]  are fun to use okay I have enough to unlock a new head this one is more
[4237.63s -> 4245.26s]  stability more recovery this is the stir one right this is the one that stirs
[4245.26s -> 4261.00s]  playing with right now and then there's this one lightweight so I know I have
[4261.00s -> 4267.29s]  this down to the very very bare bones reduced menu but what is a P stability
[4267.29s -> 4274.72s]  and recovery I'm imagining is how I get that one what is stability in AP AP is
[4274.72s -> 4287.86s]  health and then what is stability armor Oh resilience okay resilience of the
[4287.86s -> 4294.13s]  part maximum load doesn't really help oh okay it's kind of it's like a tech
[4294.13s -> 4300.59s]  armor this is the posture so this is health posture and then healing
[4300.59s -> 4315.30s]  essentially poise our this is status all right that's a very simplified version
[4315.30s -> 4324.26s]  of it I definitely think I want the one that has more health I'm gonna do this
[4324.26s -> 4333.86s]  one that's a big increase we have a we have a germ a logo oh okay maybe I'll
[4333.86s -> 4348.69s]  put it on maybe yeah maybe I'll put it on that sounded so that was like a I did
[4348.69s -> 4360.03s]  not mean for that to come out the way that that did all right no I I think I'm
[4360.03s -> 4368.29s]  gonna keep playing this game although I did say that for Final Fantasy 16 but
[4368.29s -> 4372.05s]  you know we'll see I really I need to play Final Fantasy I really was into it
[4372.05s -> 4386.33s]  too I'm getting this one and I'm putting it on so this is heavier but it's a lot
[4386.33s -> 4395.73s]  more defense and in health is what I want the head is just for fashion to be
[4395.73s -> 4410.24s]  honest okay yeah I don't know much longer I'm gonna be streaming for I
[4410.24s -> 4433.33s]  planned on like three or four hours tonight
[4435.89s -> 4454.55s]  the Zooka strat is gonna go down oh it's not good for this we're never
[4454.55s -> 4467.15s]  seeing this again hi I would not say that I'll tell you one reason why I said
[4467.15s -> 4470.35s]  that for Final Fantasy 16 but let me give you a reason why I think that this
[4470.35s -> 4477.14s]  would you would say this again I can open a mission and be done with it in
[4477.14s -> 4481.94s]  ten minutes I can open up mission and lose ten times in a row and then move to
[4481.94s -> 4499.41s]  something else these are very digestible missions I'll go back to training I
[4499.41s -> 4530.82s]  already did him right what about the logo oh shit forgot about the logo I am
[4530.82s -> 4548.24s]  going to be decked out in decals the next time you see me play this I will
[4548.24s -> 4557.23s]  use that one I'm putting that right on my chest okay destroy the tester AC over
[4557.23s -> 4569.58s]  there end up as a NASCAR mech see that's funny too just have a bunch of okay like

[4574.18s -> 4628.01s]  this wait you jumped out oh okay okay oh that hurt tried to be fancy there and I
[4628.01s -> 4680.74s]  was a mistake oh it's so slow did I get it or did I die oh I got it that's kind
[4680.74s -> 4706.39s]  of sad that was sad that was a student driver oh shit what's wrong with you
[4706.39s -> 4726.71s]  what I was told to oh am I on the wrong I'm on the bad team we're not on what on
[4726.71s -> 4753.79s]  the good team I thought we were good guys you have to ask am I on the bad
[4753.79s -> 4777.74s]  team you are on the bad team that's very true
[4786.47s -> 4803.28s]  you just want money that's it hmm new parts what I get something I want to buy
[4803.28s -> 4829.49s]  a new body oh that's I can get this new booster I'll get it where does that go
[4829.49s -> 4843.52s]  here this is the new one so this is a much heavier but I get a lot more thrust

[6372.28s -> 6381.58s]  a lot of traversing a ton of area and I hate that floating in the air to get to
[6381.58s -> 6385.28s]  another ledge in these games make it makes me want to throw up wait check
[6385.28s -> 6421.12s]  point oh that's better I'm gonna die right now oh no no no no I refuse

[6539.00s -> 6564.61s]  good we're good that one was that one was pretty hard that was fun get me the
[6564.61s -> 6621.35s]  fuck away from this thing see you later punk or how do I emote all right two
[6621.35s -> 6625.63s]  hundred and seventy thousand dollars in pay with sixty two thousand dollars in
[6625.63s -> 6633.57s]  expenses thirty six thousand dollars all right that's where they get you they get
[6633.57s -> 6643.17s]  you with the repair costs that's fun though I'm surprised there's checkpoints
[6643.17s -> 6658.27s]  that seems pretty new to uh although this is not Dark Souls but you're gonna
[6658.27s -> 6680.89s]  need them later oh what the fuck Dark Souls guys made this I will say I feel
[6680.89s -> 6685.49s]  like the from software devs are so talented and they've done so many
[6685.49s -> 6691.16s]  interesting things do you think that when people say that all Dark Souls the
[6691.16s -> 6696.88s]  Dark Souls guys that's like when people come here and say that oh it's the guy
[6696.88s -> 6714.28s]  it's the sus guy and it's the ball up his ass guy I do more than that being
[6714.28s -> 6729.46s]  the sus guy is not like Dark Souls that was not a good comparison you just
[6729.46s -> 6736.80s]  equated yourself to from soft no no I am NOT even nearly as talented I don't hold
[6736.80s -> 6749.15s]  I don't have even a fingernail of talent on the from software devs but I can do
[6749.15s -> 6786.06s]  this I don't think very many people can do that that scared this shit out of me

[7048.99s -> 7052.98s]  Wednesday or Thursday to update it imagining either probably Friday or
[7052.98s -> 7058.52s]  Sunday is where I'm thinking but not set in stone just keep an eye on the sus I
[7058.52s -> 7063.32s]  will update it at least a couple days in advance and we are gonna be playing
[7063.32s -> 7067.44s]  sorcery part 4 and to continue that playthrough whether it's Friday or
[7067.44s -> 7084.79s]  Sunday and then after that it's kind of up in the air we'll see times yeah good
[7084.79s -> 7089.99s]  times I know you're a game pass Andy are we gonna be playing starfield I will
[7089.99s -> 7094.99s]  definitely stream starfield at least once just because I feel like it's gonna
[7094.99s -> 7098.87s]  be one of those games that you're gonna have to play just because of how many
[7098.87s -> 7114.19s]  options of things there might be to do I would imagine if after sorcery I don't
[7114.19s -> 7120.16s]  really know what else to play we're just gonna play this I was a little concerned
[7120.16s -> 7123.72s]  opening it thinking hold on this might not be for me I think it is for me I
[7123.72s -> 7129.39s]  think it is very much for me so you are going to see armored core 6 again I had
[7129.39s -> 7134.20s]  a great time playing it I'd like to continue playing it I am gonna need your
[7134.20s -> 7140.09s]  help though I'm not gonna pretend like I'm gonna do this all on my own I'm
[7140.09s -> 7151.18s]  gonna be looking for help especially if I get stuck be feel free backseat when
[7151.18s -> 7157.76s]  when it's necessary what about Baldur's Gate 3 I think I'm gonna play Baldur's
[7157.76s -> 7163.94s]  Gate 3 on my own that's kind of a game I'd like to play just not being on
