[390.33s -> 400.22s]  Jesus, how long does it take for this guy to? Well, I got a coffee. I refilled the coffee. I got- I had the robe off.
[402.86s -> 404.86s]  I brushed my teeth.
[404.94s -> 409.35s]  Whatever. That- it came out really weird, didn't it?
[410.35s -> 412.35s]  I brushed my teeth.
[412.35s -> 418.70s]  Hey, hey, oh boo-boo. I'm smarter than the average bear, and I-
[419.42s -> 434.66s]  I brushed my teeth. I don't know what the fuck that was. Bernie. Yogi bear is not Bernie. No, it's- that's-
[434.82s -> 450.26s]  Oh, look at that. That's awesome. Fireman, but it's a snowman. What the heck? All right, let's go.
[450.26s -> 466.53s]  We're gonna play- I gotta change my title. This is wrong. It is not accurate. Let's put this on slime rancher, and then

[498.94s -> 504.54s]  Can you see? Aha! All right, so what are we doing?
[505.18s -> 513.34s]  Last time I played, a few days ago, I had the chickens. I had the
[514.30s -> 522.88s]  cave set up, right? I got my auto feeder. Oh, yeah, I did a Rubik's Cube and shit. Yeah, I forgot about all that.
[524.32s -> 526.82s]  Yep, I got my strawberries.
[526.94s -> 537.58s]  This game's so good. Am I in just chatting? I shouldn't be. Did it not update?
[538.06s -> 544.12s]  Should be in slime rancher. Slime money game. Am I in the wrong category? I shouldn't be.
[544.64s -> 552.75s]  We good? I was the one guy. All right, whatever.
[553.27s -> 559.53s]  All right, let's go. The last thing I was doing, and now the thing I'm doing now.
[560.05s -> 566.56s]  Put a face cam on? No, no, no. No face cam right now.
[569.15s -> 575.22s]  Market looking like. No face cam. No, I don't do face cam. I don't do face cam.
[575.22s -> 579.38s]  I do face cam only when I'm like dressed with a bathrobe on, and then I take it off.
[580.38s -> 582.82s]  Oh, this is gonna be big money.
[585.27s -> 590.35s]  Let's do a money. Let's go around and sell the stuff. I got 50 rock ploys. Holy shit, nice.
[592.07s -> 601.10s]  How much are these worth? I have 3,200 bucks. I got a ton of money. I have so much money.
[603.60s -> 606.04s]  50. All right, hold on. I gotta do some shit here.
[608.14s -> 611.34s]  Refill the feeder. What do you guys eat? You eat anything?
[612.42s -> 613.78s]  You eat?
[613.78s -> 617.62s]  Okay, yeah.
[618.06s -> 620.06s]  Face cam or else?
[620.78s -> 623.09s]  That's very fucking threatening.
[627.29s -> 636.70s]  All right, let me go sell. Let me sell these. Ooh, 16. Perfect.
[637.34s -> 648.10s]  Look at this. Look at that money. Oh, so much. How about the tabby plorts? Oh, yeah.
[648.78s -> 652.96s]  I'm gonna have like five grand.
[652.96s -> 659.20s]  Very cool. All right, I can upgrade shit. Face cam. Why do you?
[659.82s -> 669.47s]  Why? What?
[669.75s -> 674.36s]  Why do you want a face cam on?
[674.92s -> 681.53s]  So, all right, so you want a face cam on so you get to see that you look in the corner and you get to see this.
[682.09s -> 698.22s]  Why?
[698.22s -> 701.86s]  Literally, yes. No, why though? But why? You've not given me an explanation why.
[702.38s -> 709.67s]  It's tiny and you get to watch me go like this sometimes.
[709.67s -> 725.86s]  I want an explanation because all right, you can have it on for 15 minutes, but now you can't see shit.
[726.34s -> 730.17s]  Just turn it off.
[730.17s -> 733.85s]  Now this can sit here. I'll give you 15 minutes of face cam and then I never want to hear it again.
[734.41s -> 739.02s]  Because we're creepers.
[739.26s -> 748.06s]  In the middle. No, it's staying right here. All right.
[748.74s -> 753.86s]  So now I want to feed these guys. I got I got to upgrade some shit, too.
[754.78s -> 760.44s]  Hide it in the health bar. No, this is fine right here.
[761.40s -> 764.73s]  Face cam is wicked cool, dude. Thanks, man.
[766.53s -> 769.22s]  Your face cam is a treat.
[769.50s -> 781.73s]  All right, let's collect the money from the cave. Now these guys like fruits, right? They like fruit and meat.
[781.73s -> 787.55s]  Oh, I had a new thing. I fucked something up before the scream ended last time.
[788.31s -> 792.38s]  Something got really messed up last time, right?
[793.34s -> 797.40s]  Oh, yeah, I have the hunter honeys.
[798.08s -> 800.08s]  Right, okay. I remember.
[801.40s -> 809.08s]  What else is over here? We have these exploding guys, which they eat
[810.80s -> 814.35s]  meat. Didn't bring any, but we'll just keep going.
[815.07s -> 817.94s]  Okay, fruit and meat.
[818.66s -> 820.66s]  These are the hunter jellies.
[821.02s -> 825.73s]  They get mad when I come over here. All right, so they eat fruit and meat.
[825.73s -> 831.35s]  So we need fruit. We need meat. These guys eat meat. All right, so let me go feed all these guys.
[831.95s -> 839.20s]  Why is he pretending to be interested? No, that's that's just a side effect of the face cam. Don't you understand?
[839.96s -> 843.97s]  Side effect of the face cam is you're watching me
[844.81s -> 851.45s]  Talk into a microphone while I bob my head around and say things like this. All right, so we have to go over this way, right?
[852.45s -> 855.57s]  You it's because it's a symptom of the face cam
[856.17s -> 865.62s]  Because I'm just talking normally and me just talking normally without like expression. It's just me, but I don't I'm like not interested
[865.62s -> 867.98s]  I have to go like this
[868.81s -> 870.41s]  Okay, so
[870.41s -> 873.89s]  We got 25 vegetables in there
[874.49s -> 876.25s]  What we got here?
[876.29s -> 877.69s]  Okay
[877.69s -> 879.53s]  Strawberries coming up soon
[879.53s -> 881.61s]  With the face cam on that's all the only way you can tell
[882.53s -> 894.04s]  Okay, these well, look at how cute these cats are so awesome. How much money do you guys think I'm gonna make today?
[894.52s -> 902.82s]  How about five hundred dollars ready? Let's do a test. You ready? What's my emotion like right now?
[903.50s -> 905.50s]  What about what's my emotion like right now?
[905.66s -> 910.00s]  Okay, so
[910.00s -> 911.71s]  48
[911.71s -> 917.92s]  Dollars that went up a little bit. I don't how was I horny?
[918.64s -> 924.32s]  Okay, so
[924.32s -> 930.17s]  $48 that went up a little you have no fucking idea. You need the face cam to tell you how it was
[939.70s -> 943.18s]  $48 that's not enough money. That's not enough money
[946.25s -> 949.11s]  $48 that's not enough money
[959.30s -> 965.66s]  My point the point I'm making is that's a symptom of the face cam being turned on because I'm just normally just hanging out
[965.78s -> 969.02s]  But I'm not enunciating enough for the face cam to be on
[970.54s -> 974.63s]  So acting
[975.75s -> 986.48s]  Turn the cam back on now, how long do they ask that I can keep that up?
[987.90s -> 994.58s]  I'm just talking like this you want emotion with the face cam
[995.34s -> 998.18s]  I'm gonna talk normally what the fuck is happening right now
[999.34s -> 1003.78s]  When you turn don't ever when you turn 35, you just your voice turns into an old person. All right, here we go
[1004.22s -> 1008.21s]  So I'm we'll see how long I can keep this up because people want emotion with the face cam
[1013.27s -> 1014.91s]  How many do I need?
[1014.91s -> 1020.16s]  five
[1021.92s -> 1023.48s]  Okay, cool
[1023.48s -> 1030.19s]  Ten come out when you tend to it. So 10 or 12 come out each time
[1030.81s -> 1036.63s]  Take these fruits back over to where I was going
[1039.87s -> 1041.87s]  15 it's 15 15
[1042.39s -> 1063.27s]  We're gonna go feed the guys down here. They eat fruit and meat right 1 2 3 4 5
[1064.07s -> 1076.35s]  They're not hungry. Why they're not eating. What are these little cute guys? Why they're not eating. Oh, they eat meat
[1076.35s -> 1078.87s]  I had it wrong. I'm such a I'm such an idiot
[1079.59s -> 1083.62s]  I'm so stupid
[1084.38s -> 1106.26s]  These guys eat the fruit right? Who's in LA noir?
[1109.94s -> 1112.18s]  noir facial innovations
[1112.90s -> 1118.02s]  That's I'm gonna die
[1118.30s -> 1122.54s]  Good thing the face cam was just on otherwise. You would never know what my emotions look like
[1123.14s -> 1124.66s]  Get out of the cage
[1124.66s -> 1132.64s]  All right, stop
[1132.64s -> 1135.84s]  Stop exploding near me
[1136.16s -> 1138.46s]  stop I
[1138.62s -> 1171.74s]  Need to put an auto thing in there because these fucking dicks just keep exploding you little assholes
[1172.54s -> 1182.74s]  Tuck it up exploding dicks
[1188.62s -> 1191.75s]  Okay. Oh, I don't all right. So now

[5040.06s -> 5041.82s]  That you sit there and wonder
[5041.82s -> 5043.82s]  How it's possible that could even be in your body?
[5044.22s -> 5046.40s]  Like what does it look like inside of your body?
[5049.85s -> 5053.84s]  so long
[5053.84s -> 5059.79s]  I just peed out what could have been measured as a 32 ounce gatorade

[7953.24s -> 7958.44s]  Go there type in gps. I don't know. I what do I don't i've never been to joe. I want to go to mcdonald's
[7958.44s -> 7960.44s]  I want to go to george's hamburgers
[7960.60s -> 7964.43s]  I don't know where the where is where's this lab you guys are all talking about over here
[7970.22s -> 7973.58s]  Don't just go there. I don't even know what that I no idea what that is
[7976.92s -> 7978.68s]  To the south of the house
[7978.68s -> 7997.34s]  What are you going about?
[7997.34s -> 8002.14s]  The lab this is 10 000. I don't have enough money to go to the lab. Everyone go to the lab
[8003.92s -> 8008.08s]  Yeah, george's hamburgers is way more expensive. I want to go to mcdonald's. It's half price
[8010.01s -> 8030.49s]  All right. This looks good. We'll do another collection. We'll do another collection good
[8031.80s -> 8032.92s]  good
[8032.92s -> 8039.16s]  Let's feed the big guys
[8039.16s -> 8042.28s]  We need meat meat meat meat and more meat
[8043.64s -> 8045.88s]  Meat meat meat meat meat. We have enough meat
[8047.00s -> 8049.16s]  Probably not what i'm gonna take from you anyways
[8063.04s -> 8065.04s]  Ooh, okay
[8066.76s -> 8070.46s]  An elder
[8070.94s -> 8072.78s]  Perfect, okay nice
[8072.78s -> 8077.92s]  This should be enough food to get us to 10 000, which then i'll open the lab and everybody can relax
[8080.12s -> 8082.12s]  You all can stop
[8082.18s -> 8086.76s]  Screaming into your monitor to the point where condensation breath fills up all over it and you have to wipe it down
[8095.48s -> 8097.48s]  so this is
[8097.48s -> 8101.40s]  One of these is a boom hunter. It's boom hunter same thing in here. Let's just get it
[8102.36s -> 8120.67s]  It's already eaten
[8120.67s -> 8123.68s]  Ah, where's elden ring gonna come out?
[8124.40s -> 8127.23s]  hopefully, um soon, I don't know
[8127.23s -> 8129.23s]  I don't know
[8129.55s -> 8136.06s]  When was the last time they actually talked about it? I don't remember them talking about it for a long time
[8142.97s -> 8147.13s]  When they announced it
[8148.41s -> 8155.76s]  No means they've probably been working on it might get cancelled
[8156.72s -> 8163.84s]  That would be sad
[8163.84s -> 8165.84s]  All right. This is gonna take us to 10 grand. Let's find out
[8166.32s -> 8171.80s]  Be close
[8171.80s -> 8175.05s]  Not quite wait
[8175.05s -> 8177.05s]  Might get us there with this
[8179.02s -> 8193.93s]  Forget us there with this
[8193.93s -> 8200.00s]  Hmm
[8200.00s -> 8214.20s]  Yeah, this should do it 96 97 98 99
[8215.96s -> 8217.96s]  10 000
[8218.92s -> 8220.04s]  All right
[8220.04s -> 8222.04s]  I can go open the lab
[8222.44s -> 8229.16s]  I'm going for it
[8229.70s -> 8231.80s]  $10,000 purchase the lab
[8232.44s -> 8239.26s]  You've unlocked the lab a special ranch expansion that will allow you to create gadgets using slime science
[8240.36s -> 8241.79s]  What?
[8241.79s -> 8243.79s]  Go over to the barn to get started
[8253.60s -> 8258.44s]  What the hell is this place?
[8258.44s -> 8259.88s]  this barn
[8259.88s -> 8263.40s]  Has all the equipment you'll need to begin crafting gadgets using slime science
[8264.04s -> 8268.17s]  Gadgets are used for utilities to aid in exploring defensive turrets decorations and more
[8268.81s -> 8273.24s]  Did you guys actually make me buy the cosmetic?
[8274.04s -> 8278.89s]  thing
[8278.89s -> 8280.89s]  in order to fabricate gadgets
[8281.13s -> 8287.29s]  You'll need resources in your refinery try shooting a plort into the refinery. Remember any resource deposited in that cannot be removed
[8289.53s -> 8293.31s]  Or I can put a gold plort in there
[8296.83s -> 8299.32s]  um fabricate gadget
[8301.05s -> 8308.57s]  Oh, I don't have any plorts. Hold on. I gotta get a plort
[8309.71s -> 8311.71s]  I came here plortless. I
[8320.76s -> 8323.80s]  Here i'll put a boom plort in there or something. I don't know
[8324.52s -> 8352.68s]  All right. Here we go. The builder shop allows you to purchase blueprints. A blueprint is required to build any gadget
[8353.32s -> 8357.61s]  purchase blueprints
[8357.61s -> 8361.10s]  novice pump
[8361.10s -> 8362.38s]  novice
[8362.38s -> 8364.20s]  apiary
[8364.20s -> 8367.85s]  wild bees
[8367.91s -> 8368.97s]  Teleporter
[8368.97s -> 8373.82s]  Instead of two guys allow you to remotely transfer river between two points
[8374.54s -> 8377.50s]  Helper bot that can be programmed to buzz around your ranch perform tasks
[8379.05s -> 8382.33s]  med station
[8382.33s -> 8386.27s]  slime ball hoop
[8386.27s -> 8387.87s]  novice pump
[8387.87s -> 8389.95s]  cool
[8389.95s -> 8391.95s]  You buy that and then you make it over here
[8392.59s -> 8397.74s]  a novice drill
[8397.74s -> 8404.75s]  Cool, once you have blueprint the fabricator allows you to craft gadgets using resources to this binary. All right
[8405.47s -> 8407.71s]  Give it a try. I need
[8408.03s -> 8411.07s]  I don't have a route. What's a rad plort. I don't have a rad plort
[8416.09s -> 8418.09s]  I don't know what a rad plort is
[8419.71s -> 8420.91s]  What is this?
[8420.91s -> 8427.12s]  In order to place gadgets you need to enable gadget mode, which is t
[8435.10s -> 8439.66s]  Gadget mode you cannot back or shoot but you can see all the build sites in the world that you can place your gadgets
[8439.66s -> 8441.26s]  Have a look around
[8441.26s -> 8442.14s]  Oh
[8442.14s -> 8446.73s]  Oh, that's cool
[8446.73s -> 8453.07s]  This is really cool
[8453.07s -> 8456.51s]  Well, that got more elaborate once you find a build site approach it and place a gadget menu
[8457.15s -> 8460.22s]  Simply it's like the gadget you used to place
[8460.54s -> 8462.91s]  I'm really glad this is not taking inventory slot
[8463.80s -> 8467.48s]  That's a double that's a two or three clap from the devs
[8468.36s -> 8469.80s]  to the devs
[8469.80s -> 8473.24s]  I'm glad you didn't make a take-up slot. Like thank you. I mean, that's a huge clap
[8477.53s -> 8480.91s]  Okay. Well now i'm glad I don't have any money
[8482.17s -> 8487.80s]  I have no resources at all
[8487.80s -> 8489.80s]  I think I bought the slime lab
[8491.26s -> 8493.42s]  scoff
[8493.42s -> 8503.15s]  nose turn scoff
[8508.41s -> 8517.66s]  I want to go to a new area. What do you got for me? Uh mochi
[8519.52s -> 8521.79s]  250
[8521.79s -> 8525.39s]  That's I mean, that's fucking simple. That's free money. All right free money. Thank you
[8526.27s -> 8531.40s]  Go feed that fat slime. I didn't I already where is he? Is there another one?

[8862.08s -> 8864.21s]  so
[8864.21s -> 8867.65s]  I didn't get the boom plort because I didn't feed a chicken to the guys in there
[8867.65s -> 8869.65s]  But I had to go in there to get the phosphor plorts
[8869.73s -> 8872.29s]  But I forgot to bring the chicken over to feed the guy to get the boom plort
[8873.42s -> 8875.42s]  I'm constantly forgetting one item
[8876.24s -> 8879.36s]  In every single room and I have to keep going back and forth forever

[8929.46s -> 8930.82s]  I know
[8930.82s -> 8933.74s]  What are the phosphors worth?
[8933.74s -> 8935.34s]  15 cool
[8935.34s -> 8937.71s]  Oh, we have a hell of a lot of them

[8988.70s -> 8990.70s]  I almost have 10 mint mangoes
[8991.02s -> 9001.26s]  Limes have favorite foods
[9024.38s -> 9026.38s]  They give double plorts
[9026.54s -> 9032.46s]  Okay, so if I have a boom slime and a hunter slime mixed together
[9033.87s -> 9039.42s]  They will produce double from either a briar hen or a roostro. Is that correct?
[9043.36s -> 9048.08s]  Cool honey slimes love mint mangoes
[9049.10s -> 9051.26s]  So there's a honey

[9084.61s -> 9086.78s]  Know what you're saying?
[9086.78s -> 9088.78s]  Planted. Whoa
[9090.46s -> 9092.46s]  Wow, that's genius
[9095.34s -> 9097.34s]  At least plant one I will
[9097.74s -> 9101.78s]  Did I replace the um
[9102.02s -> 9103.38s]  strawberries
[9103.38s -> 9122.11s]  Just make a new one new farm
[9125.95s -> 9131.76s]  That really is doing double isn't it it is doing double isn't it what happened
[9135.56s -> 9139.02s]  15 and 14. Oh, come on. That really is doing double isn't it?

[9147.89s -> 9154.06s]  You just had your favorite food settle down
[9165.71s -> 9170.96s]  plant it
[9170.96s -> 9173.78s]  Um, I just delete this
[9174.53s -> 9176.37s]  I just delete this right?
[9176.37s -> 9194.38s]  Oh, what's this?
[9194.38s -> 9205.14s]  Oh kind of want to plant this in here, but no, he doesn't need sunshine
[9207.47s -> 9209.15s]  Careful, okay
[9209.15s -> 9216.19s]  Plant this in the lab. Um
[9229.86s -> 9237.49s]  I'm gonna plant it over here
[9237.49s -> 9245.49s]  Will the chickens come eat this?
[9245.49s -> 9257.26s]  Okay, here we go. Let's upgrade it
[9258.06s -> 9259.76s]  nutrients sprinkler
[9259.76s -> 9261.36s]  Scarce lime
[9261.36s -> 9265.28s]  There we go. Now i'm gonna be producing a ton of these, uh water balloons
[9266.16s -> 9282.00s]  Perfect. There's too many people in here. I think there's too many people in here
[9282.64s -> 9289.90s]  Maybe not. All right
[9289.90s -> 9291.90s]  Next on tap is I want to go
[9297.63s -> 9299.63s]  Uh, all right, that's going

[9307.84s -> 9309.84s]  a pink blob
[9309.92s -> 9313.76s]  Let them breed free range
[9313.92s -> 9320.45s]  Is that for you? Is that for real?
[9323.31s -> 9325.31s]  All right, let them breed free range
[9328.93s -> 9330.13s]  No
[9330.13s -> 9332.13s]  One guy, okay fucking god
[9333.73s -> 9335.73s]  Breed free range
[9335.73s -> 9338.13s]  Of course, that's bullshit. Why would that be real?
[9345.76s -> 9348.00s]  All right. All right, let's go

[9352.08s -> 9353.60s]  Teleporter
[9353.60s -> 9356.08s]  I'm gonna go deposit all this shit into the refinery
[9356.72s -> 9359.76s]  And then i'm going to go
[9359.76s -> 9365.25s]  What should I do now if i'm not gone?
[9370.22s -> 9390.50s]  I'll sleep first

[11269.95s -> 11288.02s]  All right deposit. I've been holding this gold plort for the whole game
[11293.34s -> 11296.78s]  All right. I am ready to start making cash. Now. Here we go
[11297.50s -> 11303.36s]  Deposit these because then yeah, i'm gonna need them and we're gonna feed a bunch of meat a bunch of fruits bunch of vegetables
[11303.36s -> 11313.02s]  And we're gonna go
[11313.02s -> 11315.02s]  J g went worth
[11315.18s -> 11317.18s]  Eight seven seven cash now
[11317.26s -> 11319.26s]  Eight seven seven cash now
[11319.76s -> 11323.36s]  If you have an annuity and you need cash now
[11324.08s -> 11327.68s]  All j g went worth eight seven seven cash now
[11328.40s -> 11330.40s]  Eight seven seven cash now
[11330.40s -> 11332.16s]  What a dumb commercial
[11332.16s -> 11334.16s]  All right, uh, I need money
[11338.34s -> 11340.74s]  So I need rad plorts don't have any
[11341.38s -> 11351.44s]  That's a scam. I don't know nothing about it. I just remember the guy on the viking helmet on the subway
[11352.16s -> 11356.14s]  I don't know anything about the company. I don't even know what they I don't even know what they do
[11357.34s -> 11362.76s]  I remember the guy on the viking helmet standing up on the subway and going if you have an annuity annuity
[11375.26s -> 11379.66s]  No, and then the guy comes on he goes it's your money use it when you need it
[11381.39s -> 11382.75s]  right
[11382.75s -> 11385.63s]  That commercial played I think every 12 seconds
[11386.35s -> 11388.66s]  That was on every commercial break
[11393.54s -> 11396.58s]  You could not go 20 minutes without seeing that commercial
[11397.30s -> 11402.86s]  Think of how much ad space that is
[11403.26s -> 11405.98s]  Think how much money that probably is to have that ad play
[11406.70s -> 11411.10s]  Across every fucking network on earth every 15 to 20 minutes
[11414.05s -> 11416.29s]  Holy godness. It's a lot of money

[11762.94s -> 11771.84s]  Is that over here?
[11771.84s -> 11780.35s]  No, I think plorts are way more important for slime science than for selling. Yeah, that's it
[11780.35s -> 11782.35s]  I figured I was gonna just start dumping
[11783.66s -> 11785.66s]  just massive massive amounts of uh
[11786.54s -> 11789.89s]  Yeah, i'm gonna start dumping massive amounts of pink
[11790.93s -> 11792.45s]  into the machine
[11792.45s -> 11795.14s]  And then once that's done
[11795.94s -> 11806.30s]  Get rid of all the pink slimes because i'm not gonna need them anymore. Maybe i'll keep one
[11810.53s -> 11812.85s]  All right. It's time for a big sell here
[11813.73s -> 11818.83s]  Money is worth that. They're kind of losing value. Oh, hopefully I can make some cash from this. It's gonna be a lot
[11823.07s -> 11830.46s]  Good. Yeah. All right. I'll have a lot of money. I need to do research
[11831.02s -> 11841.22s]  Feels good every time. All right

[11851.34s -> 11854.86s]  Let's get i'm gonna whatever I pick up right now i'm literally throwing in the machine
[11855.74s -> 11865.07s]  Water plorts go for like 40s. Have you considered getting more puddles?
[11866.19s -> 11868.19s]  Maybe
[11868.67s -> 11870.29s]  Probably
[11870.29s -> 11872.13s]  Yeah, I think so
[11872.13s -> 11876.54s]  But maybe not right this second. How you guys doing over here? You have anything else I can pick up?

[11896.48s -> 11898.56s]  All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. I'm going
[11900.10s -> 11902.16s]  deposit
[11902.16s -> 11904.00s]  And then research a bunch of stuff
[11904.00s -> 11908.93s]  What was it really more useful on the beach?
[11917.26s -> 11919.58s]  All right. What can I do now? Let's deposit all this stuff
[11920.46s -> 11931.58s]  Okay, blueprints
[11931.82s -> 11936.70s]  Novice pump allows you to siphon underground resources for one cycle. I don't even know what that means
[11938.96s -> 11940.80s]  Gonna just get it
[11940.80s -> 11943.36s]  I guess

[11974.38s -> 11978.10s]  Siphon resources
[11978.10s -> 11982.02s]  Why did I make so many because I had a lot of I don't know
[11982.66s -> 11985.73s]  I want to see what I want to see what it does
[11985.89s -> 11993.10s]  What does it do last for 12 minutes?
[11993.82s -> 11996.99s]  What the hell does this thing do? It's a little like r2d2 machine. What is it?
[12000.48s -> 12001.44s]  uh
[12001.44s -> 12007.47s]  slime science
[12007.47s -> 12008.51s]  extractors
[12008.51s -> 12015.47s]  Once placed on a build site an extractor will begin working collecting resources from the environment over time
[12015.87s -> 12017.87s]  Once it's full of resources an extract can be emptied
[12018.43s -> 12021.79s]  The best extractors can repeat this cycle multiple times before they finally break down
[12022.67s -> 12025.79s]  Each extractor can find exclusive resources if used in the correct zone
[12026.43s -> 12029.34s]  Pumps can find a special resource in the dry reef
[12030.53s -> 12033.01s]  Rills find a special resource into indigo quarry
[12033.87s -> 12039.97s]  Apiaries can find special resource in moss blanket and all extractors can find special resources in the glass desert. This is a pump
[12040.61s -> 12042.05s]  In the dry reef
[12042.05s -> 12045.57s]  I need to go to the dry reef
[12045.57s -> 12050.99s]  The hell is the dry reef?
[12050.99s -> 12053.57s]  So do I just let this run?
[12053.57s -> 12054.85s]  Oh, whatever
[12054.85s -> 12056.96s]  What else can I get?
[12056.96s -> 12063.65s]  A set of two teleporters that can be used to create your own quick travel link. Yep. I would love to see what that does
[12067.63s -> 12069.66s]  ink teleporter
[12069.66s -> 12074.78s]  inkplot deep brine strange diamond in a hexacom. Well, I don't have that
[12077.57s -> 12081.65s]  drone helper bot that can be programmed to buzz around your ranch and perform a variety of tasks
[12082.13s -> 12084.13s]  That's 2 000 bucks, but is it worth it?
[12087.20s -> 12090.34s]  drone helper bot
[12090.42s -> 12096.43s]  I need honey quantum hunter wild honey jelly stone or hex. Oh, that's a lot of resources. Okay
[12100.27s -> 12104.90s]  Well, what that's gonna do maybe should you get that apiary?
[12105.46s -> 12107.14s]  I was supposed to learn it
[12107.14s -> 12112.78s]  Well, this is a pump. Okay apiary honey plort
[12113.66s -> 12115.58s]  honey rad plorts
[12115.58s -> 12120.24s]  Drones are so worth it. Okay
[12120.24s -> 12125.49s]  Good to know
[12125.49s -> 12129.81s]  Um, I have the two keys now. All right. First of all, let's take a let's take another pee break. I'll be right back

[12851.18s -> 12854.38s]  I want as many of these as I can fucking carry
[12862.86s -> 12864.86s]  New slime just dropped. Yep

[12869.52s -> 12875.01s]  Edgies
[12878.27s -> 12880.70s]  That's the only new slime that's here so far
[12882.37s -> 12884.37s]  We're gonna get an absolute shitload of them
[12884.77s -> 12890.21s]  I think more than 40 is perfect. We can just breed them
[12890.69s -> 12900.70s]  Oh over there
[12900.70s -> 12906.18s]  I'll get a full stack
[12906.18s -> 12908.82s]  Teleporter over here. All right, 43 seems like a good amount
[12909.38s -> 12913.47s]  Read their info
[12913.47s -> 12914.99s]  rad slime
[12914.99s -> 12916.99s]  Favorite food is oka oka
[12917.39s -> 12932.74s]  But the favorite food is oka oka. So we're going to grow
[12933.30s -> 12934.42s]  oka oka
[12934.42s -> 12941.84s]  Favorite food is oka oka. So we're gonna grow it
[12946.06s -> 12952.22s]  I think we're gonna replace the beets because what's the point right now? Do I really want to grow beets still?
[12953.02s -> 12956.16s]  When I have oka oka and it's a rad slimes favorite
[12957.04s -> 12963.26s]  I don't think there's a reason for it anymore. All right, let's go back
[12970.00s -> 12973.46s]  All right, it's time
[12973.94s -> 12976.42s]  I believe it is time
[12976.42s -> 12978.42s]  We are going to get rid of
[12978.50s -> 12982.75s]  one of these
[12982.75s -> 12984.11s]  rocks
[12984.11s -> 12985.79s]  or cats
[12985.79s -> 12989.18s]  Who gets to go away?
[12989.18s -> 12993.26s]  I'm also going to get rid of the beet farm. I'm going to replace it with a oka oka farm
[12994.22s -> 12996.53s]  Oh, these are here the end of the beats
[12999.42s -> 13001.10s]  You have other cats
[13001.10s -> 13006.50s]  That's right. I do I do have other cats
[13007.06s -> 13018.38s]  Other cats no other rocks. That's right
[13019.92s -> 13021.92s]  And that's where we can get our pink from as well
[13022.72s -> 13026.96s]  So cats it was great. You were the first you were my first real money maker
[13029.20s -> 13031.92s]  But it's time for you to go. You're all going to be free
[13032.64s -> 13035.63s]  I will give you one last delicious meal
[13036.75s -> 13038.91s]  And then you're all going i'm not going to give you any more food
[13039.55s -> 13042.24s]  And you're all going to go on your own
[13042.40s -> 13056.22s]  The rock's favorite food is beets
[13060.27s -> 13061.17s]  but
[13061.17s -> 13066.10s]  Oh, but I don't it doesn't matter
[13066.10s -> 13072.45s]  All right. Hold on. Let me one thing at a time. Let's go make a new plot
[13073.01s -> 13092.83s]  Don't fall out. I got more of my puddle slimes here hanging out in the pool
[13093.79s -> 13095.31s]  a little plot
[13095.31s -> 13097.34s]  Cool. Cool
[13097.34s -> 13099.49s]  uh, all right
[13099.49s -> 13103.09s]  I mean I
[13103.09s -> 13106.69s]  I want more rat. No, no, no. Okay. We're putting rad slimes in here
[13109.95s -> 13112.27s]  And we're gonna put that hunter over there like I mean
[13113.82s -> 13116.78s]  Make a rad hunter. So I do rad but no no
[13117.50s -> 13122.24s]  What's the most expensive thing right now?
[13122.24s -> 13124.24s]  What would give me the best return here rad? What?
[13125.26s -> 13130.54s]  Pure rad probably probably just pure rad. Yeah, I don't want I don't want hunter red pure rad is more money
[13131.26s -> 13142.43s]  Yeah, we're gonna put this guy over here. He'll be happier with this. He'll be happier over here with actual friends
[13156.58s -> 13159.87s]  All right. I'm only gonna hmm. I'm gonna put
[13160.51s -> 13162.50s]  How many should I put in one?
[13162.50s -> 13164.85s]  That too many
[13164.85s -> 13173.20s]  This thing's fucking exploding
[13173.20s -> 13176.54s]  All of them in here
[13176.54s -> 13181.18s]  That they're gonna stack on top of each other. Don't you think I mean if this is just a moneymaker though, then it doesn't matter
[13181.18s -> 13186.93s]  They won't get out
[13186.93s -> 13189.97s]  If I just put oka okas in here and just get massive cash
[13190.69s -> 13204.32s]  They're not they won't get out. Oh fuck. I have no money. All right, i'm gonna go plant the oka oka. We'll get rid of beats
[13205.04s -> 13216.00s]  Holy shit. All right. Well, here's the moneymaker right here. Let's just make some money make make some uh cash
[13216.00s -> 13218.50s]  Okay
[13219.22s -> 13235.02s]  Looking good and then what do I want to combine? All right, I gotta i'm gonna store these odd onions
[13235.66s -> 13240.78s]  Okay odd onions go in here
[13241.68s -> 13243.68s]  I can store the beats
[13243.84s -> 13247.76s]  What else did I got in here?
[13247.76s -> 13250.08s]  All right oka oka. We're gonna grow instead of the beats
[13253.44s -> 13256.13s]  Combine them
[13256.13s -> 13258.13s]  What do you mean combine them?
[13259.81s -> 13263.89s]  Wait, can you say feed a green plot to the green to the rads?
[13264.77s -> 13275.94s]  Okay, remove crops oka oka go you can't do that
[13276.58s -> 13279.14s]  All right. We got oka oka is growing now
[13281.58s -> 13283.34s]  You can fit more if you keep them small
[13283.34s -> 13285.98s]  That was my theory is just have a bunch of small ones and feed the hell out of them
[13286.62s -> 13288.62s]  And make fifty thousand dollars
[13288.94s -> 13296.75s]  No, no more booms. The booms have kind of pissed me off. They're really annoying and loud and they just hate you and just explode
[13297.63s -> 13305.82s]  Okay, so let's do this
[13305.82s -> 13307.82s]  I will have a full stack of
[13308.32s -> 13309.66s]  beats
[13309.66s -> 13310.88s]  essentially
[13310.88s -> 13312.88s]  Yes, I need them for anything good

[15233.54s -> 15242.02s]  All right, I think I can go back. I streamed it for like three hours and I gave up didn't I?
[15249.04s -> 15251.04s]  Yeah, no, did I do it more than once?

[15301.63s -> 15308.58s]  Because this is just boom cat. I already have pink cat
[15310.27s -> 15312.59s]  I feel like the boom cats are not really worth having
[15319.25s -> 15320.93s]  Throw them into the ocean
[15320.93s -> 15323.10s]  How do I get rid of them from here?
[15328.74s -> 15331.46s]  These meat only meat only suck. That's true
[15332.32s -> 15334.32s]  Incinerate them. I don't have an incinerator
[15334.66s -> 15364.90s]  Okay, that works
[15364.90s -> 15373.92s]  All right, what you're bullying?
[15374.24s -> 15376.30s]  What i'm you? Okay
[15376.30s -> 15377.26s]  so
[15377.26s -> 15382.19s]  You want me to let's get this correct here. I'm seeing in the chat
[15383.66s -> 15389.02s]  Incinerate them what i'm doing is i'm giving him a chance. I'm giving them a chance
[15391.79s -> 15397.71s]  You incinerate implies pick up burn to death. What i'm doing is shooting him free into the ocean
[15398.43s -> 15412.38s]  So he's got a chance
[15412.38s -> 15416.86s]  No, and i'm i'm fine. I won't even shoot him into the ocean. Here's what i'll do check this out. Okay, ready
[15422.42s -> 15424.50s]  Go back go back go back go back
[15424.50s -> 15426.62s]  Go back
[15426.62s -> 15431.74s]  Don't even think about it. He was gonna explode. He was waiting for he was gonna he was doing the thing that you did in team fortress
[15432.38s -> 15434.46s]  We just sat at a teleporter as a spy
[15435.10s -> 15441.26s]  And found the direction where it was facing stood behind it and backstabbed like 12 people as they came out
[15442.14s -> 15446.86s]  Look, there we go. He can be free. You know, you can just live out here. No, we can't
[15450.19s -> 15452.19s]  Look, I they can live on their own island over there
[15459.31s -> 15462.83s]  I would do that to a point. We're in the chat in the team tf2 chat
[15463.63s -> 15465.63s]  We would be screaming at all capitals
[15466.27s -> 15469.95s]  Kill the fucking spy at the teleporter. Oh my god
[15470.91s -> 15476.16s]  You guys are fucking stupid
[15476.96s -> 15484.56s]  Heavy sitting there going naked
[15484.56s -> 15504.86s]  See he he's blasting forward and rocket shipping over there. This is i'm not murdering him. I'm letting them fly to a new island
[15505.58s -> 15508.22s]  They can populate it and have have a go free
[15509.66s -> 15513.98s]  Incinerate them look ready. Look at this. There's look at the islands over here
[15514.94s -> 15518.58s]  See look at that. He's going all the way over the mountain poof into the distance
[15518.58s -> 15521.54s]  He just did a rocket. He turned on thrusters and went forward over the cliff
[15522.42s -> 15523.78s]  He'll be fine
[15523.78s -> 15531.50s]  He's gonna land somewhere and just be like, oh i'm fine. I'm good
[15532.38s -> 15535.90s]  Plus look at how strong they are. They have powerful explosion abilities and he's a cat
[15536.70s -> 15546.19s]  Nothing's gonna hurt him
[15546.19s -> 15547.87s]  and then poof
[15547.87s -> 15558.51s]  blaster
[15558.51s -> 15561.39s]  Okay, now we get to do something cool shit
[15562.75s -> 15565.06s]  It was really fun. You guys helped me a lot
[15565.54s -> 15573.65s]  He did a great job
[15573.65s -> 15579.06s]  Uh, he is that I think he did explode. I think I got it wrong. I think he actually is exploding in the air
[15579.70s -> 15583.12s]  It's too much oxygen in the atmosphere and it just sucks up into when he blows up
[15583.76s -> 15587.04s]  That's what's happening. All right crystal slimes going in
[15591.76s -> 15595.76s]  Crystal slime we will feed rad plorts to crystal slimes
[15598.11s -> 15599.23s]  Correct
[15599.23s -> 15601.14s]  That's what i'm doing
[15601.14s -> 15602.10s]  or
[15602.10s -> 15604.46s]  Do we just have crystal slimes make money?
[15605.66s -> 15609.15s]  Oh shit
[15609.15s -> 15610.88s]  Yes
[15610.88s -> 15621.04s]  I'm sounding like a child. What just leave the crystals should I I shouldn't combine them
[15621.76s -> 15628.85s]  Crystal rads, that's what I was thinking gold. I I thought you can't feed gold to anybody
[15635.57s -> 15637.57s]  Your crystal is better. Is it?
[15638.69s -> 15640.61s]  You can't feed gold anybody
[15640.61s -> 15642.61s]  What do they eat veggies? Oh, this is perfect
[15645.38s -> 15646.82s]  Eat it a water
[15646.82s -> 15649.71s]  Okay. Well, hold on. Let me let me just check this out

[15721.92s -> 15723.76s]  You got to use the expensive stuff
[15723.76s -> 15730.22s]  How much are they worth?
[15730.30s -> 15733.42s]  75 pop 30. Okay. Thankfully that market came back

[16374.52s -> 16381.31s]  This game is a gigantic loop
[16381.71s -> 16382.91s]  Yes, it is
[16382.91s -> 16384.91s]  It is a huge loop
[16385.60s -> 16389.04s]  It's just a loop. I know but it's a very satisfying loop
[16389.76s -> 16395.28s]  It's a loop that I am having a great time doing
[16396.48s -> 16399.16s]  Okay
[16399.16s -> 16401.24s]  teleporter
[16401.24s -> 16403.90s]  Is over here, right?
[16403.90s -> 16408.03s]  Oh this way
[16408.03s -> 16410.03s]  You got me addicted to this game again
[16410.43s -> 16413.53s]  I don't know. I'm not gonna apologize for that. This is awesome
[16416.70s -> 16419.28s]  What we got?
[16419.28s -> 16422.48s]  whoa
[16422.54s -> 16426.08s]  Indigonium indigonium and jelly stones
[16430.27s -> 16432.51s]  Whoa indigonium jelly stones
[16433.95s -> 16438.57s]  What's that indigonium jelly stone is a rock
[16439.87s -> 16444.26s]  um
[16444.26s -> 16446.26s]  Apologize to them to what?
[16449.37s -> 16451.37s]  Uh, I don't want to put a pump in here. I want to drill
[16451.69s -> 16453.45s]  It's a rock. How do I get that? I'm gonna have to
[16454.17s -> 16456.28s]  Will that stay here?
[16456.28s -> 16458.28s]  That's gonna stay here, right if I leave
[16459.52s -> 16464.96s]  It's a fossil. Okay, i'm right back
[16478.24s -> 16482.46s]  Hurry i'm getting hungry. I'm hungry
[16483.87s -> 16486.91s]  All right, i'm gonna clean this up and then i'm gonna stream again
[16487.63s -> 16502.52s]  And then we'll pick right back up tomorrow
[16502.52s -> 16505.48s]  And after tomorrow, we'll see how far I am and how much i'm still doing
[16507.45s -> 16512.33s]  Because maybe one more stream of this would be us get satisfied of playing. Maybe not. We'll see
[16513.29s -> 16524.28s]  All right. I gotta go back
[16524.28s -> 16525.88s]  slime fossil
[16525.88s -> 16528.19s]  Oh
[16528.19s -> 16530.59s]  Well, the idea is to make just a shitload of drills and put them in here
[16531.47s -> 16533.47s]  right one two
[16533.63s -> 16535.55s]  three four five
[16535.55s -> 16544.86s]  One two, three, four five just make like ten of them. I'm gonna make ten drills and put them in here
[16554.30s -> 16556.30s]  Unlock the advanced one first. Yeah, good idea
[16565.44s -> 16567.44s]  All right. Here we go. What do we got?
[16568.73s -> 16570.73s]  advanced drill
[16570.73s -> 16575.18s]  Last three full cycles. Holy shit. Okay, got it. What else can I do?
[16575.74s -> 16578.56s]  What's the difference between blue and gray?
[16580.49s -> 16586.96s]  color
[16586.96s -> 16591.84s]  Advanced drill I need pink plorts pink and rock plorts. I know where to get those
[16592.56s -> 16607.07s]  What's your favorite food?
[16607.07s -> 16612.83s]  Heartbeat I don't have any more of those
[16613.31s -> 16614.59s]  Maybe I do
[16614.59s -> 16628.24s]  Here you go
[16628.24s -> 16636.41s]  Hey, give me one back because I need to grow it
[16636.97s -> 16648.40s]  What are the docs? Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. I'm i'm working working on something. Oh shit
[16654.00s -> 16669.15s]  31 nice. Okay, good. Cool
[16674.17s -> 16676.30s]  now
[16676.30s -> 16679.18s]  Like this
[16679.18s -> 16681.18s]  God, I got okay. Hold on
[16681.66s -> 16686.14s]  What's your favorite kind of pizza?
[16686.14s -> 16688.14s]  depends on the day
[16688.22s -> 16690.46s]  probably like um
[16691.18s -> 16694.46s]  I like i'm a big just standard pepperoni just pepperoni
[16698.80s -> 16700.80s]  I want this food now. So like hurry up
[16701.44s -> 16707.34s]  What do you guys like?
[16707.34s -> 16709.42s]  Whatever. Oh here just I want pink
[16720.43s -> 16724.27s]  I don't know. I don't like that crust pizza. I like thin crust pizza
[16725.66s -> 16728.48s]  crispy thin
[16729.04s -> 16737.82s]  With pepperoni, you know, this is really good garlic and onion
[16738.89s -> 16743.21s]  Garlic and onion pizza is really really fantastic. I would highly recommend it if you've ever had it
[16754.97s -> 16756.97s]  Just cheese, you know, i'm not gonna
[16757.45s -> 16759.45s]  Say that just cheese is not good
[16760.59s -> 16762.59s]  Sometimes just cheese is all you want
[16763.88s -> 16767.24s]  Good slice of cheese pizza is perfect a lot of times
[16768.28s -> 16777.20s]  Okay, let's go make a few of those
[16777.20s -> 16780.49s]  Four cheese
[16780.49s -> 16781.29s]  Yeah
[16781.29s -> 16783.31s]  Kind of like a white pizza
[16783.31s -> 16785.80s]  White pizza is fantastic
[16785.80s -> 16787.80s]  I gotta really be in the mood for white pizza though
[16787.96s -> 16808.64s]  All right to the lab
[16808.64s -> 16812.96s]  Deep dish pizza. I actually don't like deep dish pizza. I'm not a big fan of it because it's pie
[16813.76s -> 16815.68s]  It's kind of like a pie. I don't really like it
[16816.48s -> 16827.08s]  It's a little too. It's it's really heavy too tons of cheese
[16828.12s -> 16830.72s]  the cheese pie
[16830.72s -> 16832.72s]  I mean this is not
[16832.80s -> 16834.24s]  Kind of what I like
[16834.24s -> 16837.63s]  You've been to st. Louis. I've never been to st. Louis
[16838.11s -> 16842.72s]  All right advanced drill
[16842.72s -> 16845.44s]  One two, I can only make two of these right now. I need more pink
[16848.70s -> 16851.48s]  more pink
[16851.48s -> 16852.44s]  Oh
[16852.44s -> 16859.53s]  Whatever i'll do that later. I need pink
[16862.54s -> 16867.90s]  I'll just put these up for now
[16867.90s -> 16869.90s]  They're my flavored pizza. What do you mean?
[16875.88s -> 16877.88s]  Somebody mentioned this earlier
[16878.04s -> 16880.04s]  These things just stay consistently expensive
[16880.76s -> 16883.40s]  I should really I should honestly 2020 hindsight
[16884.38s -> 16887.58s]  That should have been a pond over there and I should have had like two dozen of these things
[16888.38s -> 16894.33s]  Okay, uh, let's teleport back
[16906.01s -> 16907.80s]  advanced
[16907.80s -> 16912.30s]  drill
[16912.30s -> 16917.82s]  That's just gonna go with the recycles. Well, well, well remind me of that. Yes. Uh, um, what?
[16918.46s -> 16922.46s]  Remind me of that yesterday remind me of this tomorrow because i'm gonna forget these are here
[16933.53s -> 16937.77s]  All right. All right. I'm gonna call it here. I am prepared to go explore another area
[16940.88s -> 16942.88s]  very soon here
[16944.12s -> 16946.12s]  Pause at this before I go
[16950.57s -> 16955.95s]  Or sell sell
[16955.95s -> 16963.29s]  Doc we'll do that tomorrow buy the docs. Well, all right remind me to buy the doc tomorrow
[16964.17s -> 16966.17s]  and to open up those, uh
[16967.18s -> 16968.70s]  Things I got back there
[16968.70s -> 16979.93s]  I got 15 grand. This is awesome. All right. Is there anything I can buy right now?
[16980.81s -> 16982.81s]  Treasure cracker. Is it time to get this?
[16983.13s -> 16992.03s]  I'm doing it
[16992.03s -> 17000.30s]  The van cool. All right. Awesome
[17001.34s -> 17003.42s]  I still have one key. I'm gonna go to the dock tomorrow
[17004.62s -> 17005.74s]  and
[17005.74s -> 17013.13s]  Oh, that's five grand. Would you want valve to make team fortress three?
[17014.01s -> 17015.29s]  Uh, no
[17015.29s -> 17017.29s]  Not unless they really wanted to
[17021.32s -> 17023.64s]  I feel like that would have to be a project that really wanted to work on
[17024.36s -> 17031.10s]  And we got half-life alex because they just felt like making it and that game was incredible
[17031.50s -> 17038.24s]  Whenever valve tries to jump on something that they think they should be doing doesn't turn out well
[17043.04s -> 17047.84s]  When valve does something because valve feels like they want to do it because it's something that somebody has a cool idea
[17049.44s -> 17057.26s]  Usually turns out okay
[17057.26s -> 17061.66s]  So let them let them do it do things that they want to do at their pace whenever they feel like it
[17061.98s -> 17063.98s]  That's how you get the best shit from valve
[17066.94s -> 17071.02s]  And I I mean obviously everyone kind of thought well, maybe they lost it. They don't have it anymore
[17072.24s -> 17076.08s]  I wasn't a big dota 2 fan. I know it's popular but uh, whatever artifact was
[17076.96s -> 17080.40s]  Kind of weird and messy. I don't I guess it was okay. I don't know
[17081.28s -> 17086.27s]  Can they make games anymore? Do they even want to make games anymore? And then half-life alex comes out and it's like well
[17086.27s -> 17088.04s]  Okay, never mind
[17088.04s -> 17090.72s]  I guess they can still do that
[17090.72s -> 17104.92s]  So I guess just wait for them to do something that they feel like doing game of the year artifact. I would disagree with you
[17105.48s -> 17114.62s]  They're contributing in other ways to the games industry. Oh, yeah, i'm just talking merely game development
[17115.79s -> 17117.47s]  just purely
[17117.47s -> 17119.87s]  Valve making a video game in-house
[17120.43s -> 17127.00s]  I mean you want to talk about like the business side of things. I mean they they kind of changed the entire world
[17128.48s -> 17134.09s]  With steam and everything but you know, that's a whole nother conversation for the german 985 podcast
[17134.73s -> 17138.38s]  With special guests next week
[17138.38s -> 17146.83s]  Otto, I don't have anybody. It's just me and the dog. I'll see you guys tomorrow. Have a great rest of your night

[17152.14s -> 17156.54s]  See how it goes if i'm still having fun then well then yeah, i'll maybe i'll keep going
[17160.92s -> 17163.16s]  Have a great night. Let's go through the credits

[17257.39s -> 17267.63s]  Seeing a lot of names. Hmm

[17378.59s -> 17382.59s]  I feel like raiding channels on this channel is me picking food at a restaurant
