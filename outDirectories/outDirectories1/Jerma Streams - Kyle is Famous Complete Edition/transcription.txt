[4.09s -> 11.42s]  You know what else I want to do? Hi, sorry if I startled you. Um, the whole wrestling,
[11.98s -> 16.87s]  hey, what song is this thing? Does anybody know? Remember when we did that video game sound effect
[16.87s -> 25.43s]  thing where I had to figure out what game it was from or what character did it from? Oh, here's a
[25.43s -> 33.62s]  sound effect. And what is that? What's that from? Are there more of those? I want to do one of those.
[33.62s -> 47.46s]  Is there is there a good one? There are a few more of those. If any of you guys know any,
[47.46s -> 55.14s]  there are mods if you can get me a good one. One that I haven't done. That'd be fun to do.
[63.96s -> 71.69s]  It's sporkle. Yeah, it would have to be something that they can play sound effects through the
[71.69s -> 91.66s]  browser. What's what's sporkle? I mean, look this up. Sporkle. It's, it's just a trivia site.
[92.46s -> 95.66s]  No, I don't want to do trivia. I want to do sound effects. Then I have to guess what the sound is.
[103.05s -> 111.16s]  Okay. It looks like Kyle is famous as one. So I'm going to open it. Give some time to maybe get a
[111.16s -> 142.10s]  couple of these fun websites. It's getting loud. All right, play. What you're describing is true.
[142.10s -> 152.44s]  No, but it's not trivia though. Trivia would be this plumber back in 1985 or 1983 got his start
[152.44s -> 155.56s]  jumping on goombas. And it'd be, oh, okay. That's I know that. Let me see what it is.
[156.28s -> 172.28s]  Search it up on sporkle. You piece of shit. Sporkle is based and pog. All right. Hold on.
[173.16s -> 177.91s]  Do they have what I'm describing? Hold on. I want to find the one I want to find.
[184.38s -> 205.58s]  Hold on. They do. They have that. All right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Sporkle is cracked. Do I need
[205.58s -> 231.88s]  an account? Wait, what? Is this for real? Okay. Hold on a second. I have to turn off ad blocker.
[232.76s -> 257.14s]  Okay. The play that is not cool. This is like, hold on. I guess it is. Play quiz. Hold on.
[257.14s -> 265.66s]  Hurdle. You should do hurdle. All right. Here's what we're going to do. I'm going to I'm going
[265.66s -> 269.66s]  to play Kyle is famous. I'm not the stream is going to be not two hours long guys. We'll get
[269.66s -> 274.23s]  a couple of good ones. But I got to I got to do something. I got it. We'll curate a few.
[274.79s -> 304.90s]  All right. I'm back. Capture this. There it is. Okay. So this is a choose your own adventure
[304.90s -> 310.01s]  game where you have to make decisions. You have to make choices. I said I was going to fix the
[310.01s -> 323.13s]  camera but I didn't. Okay. Here we go. Somebody said they went to McDonald's. They enjoyed the
[323.13s -> 326.41s]  double cheeseburger and the four piece nuggets that they ordered. So I thought I would follow
[326.41s -> 330.25s]  German's advice and offer my thanks to the chef. The lady at the register just stared at me like
[330.25s -> 341.10s]  I had two heads. Oh, come on. This is voice acting is famous. Okay. Sure. Tell me if it's
[341.10s -> 348.94s]  too loud. Kyle is host of the most popular talk show in recent memory. Stay up late with Kyle.
[350.07s -> 358.55s]  Okay. What are my choices? Stay up late with Kyle has grown in popularity quickly in the last year
[358.55s -> 367.13s]  and the public has noticed. Okay. Inside has called Kyle a most excellent dumpy white man.
[368.38s -> 376.92s]  All right. Cool. Top tech noted that Kyle is inspiring youth to explore stem fields.
[376.92s -> 382.76s]  Is this AI? Is this randomly generated? Most other talk shows are dedicated to discussing
[382.76s -> 390.15s]  Kyle and his personal details. This has to be randomly generated, right? Most online videos
[390.15s -> 399.08s]  are best of clips taken from Kyle's latest broadcast. Okay. The eye of the world is upon
[399.08s -> 408.36s]  Kyle. Okay. Tonight is Kyle's most important guest interview yet. All right. Stay up late
[408.36s -> 414.28s]  with Kyle will be featuring Rachel May. She is a kind and lovely. I have to click on this.
[416.82s -> 421.62s]  She is dear to the hearts of many. This interview requires preparation.
[422.89s -> 434.23s]  Okay. Wait, what did I miss? No, no, no, we're good. Kyle cracked his eyes open knowing today
[434.23s -> 438.71s]  is his last chance to prepare for the interview. Okay. So I got a show. I got to prepare for the
[438.71s -> 444.71s]  interview. I got an interview to do. Let's go. Kyle has 30 hours left. He must choose his actions
[444.71s -> 456.17s]  wisely. Okay. Okay. First decision in the morning was made wisely wither away or exit the bed. I
[456.17s -> 461.85s]  mean, we're going to exit the bed. Kyle ex exited his bed and took a quick glance around his bedroom.
[463.86s -> 470.42s]  Uh scavenge. Kyle quickly crouched down on the floor realizing his immediate need for bugs.
[471.06s -> 475.62s]  Kyle started to pick between the fuzz of his bedroom carpet hoping to catch a stray beetle or
[475.62s -> 484.58s]  two. Okay. Soon he had a small handful of various insects dead and alive. I eat them. Kyle threw back
[484.58s -> 490.42s]  his head and crammed the sticky wriggling mass into his mouth. He felt refreshed. I did that for
[490.42s -> 503.10s]  five hours. Wait, wait, hold on. There's a system in this game where. All right. I did that for
[503.10s -> 510.71s]  six hours. All right. Open the closet. It was dark and he could only really see his hanging shirts.
[510.71s -> 514.79s]  Choose an outfit. Kyle decided to take some time to choose the perfect outfit.
[523.82s -> 529.58s]  Suit of armor. Kyle was unsure of what exactly to decide to wear his armor, but it felt like the
[529.58s -> 535.58s]  right thing to do. Okay. After much squeezing and sweating, Kyle managed to wrap the metal suit
[535.58s -> 545.02s]  around his dumpy self, which would be hard. I get it. I get it. Trust me. All right. So the desk
[548.30s -> 556.89s]  write notes for the interview. Kyle wrote down his first question. Um, I are you a mother?
[557.61s -> 564.10s]  Kyle wrote down his second question. You ever eaten a raw whole egg? Sure. Kyle wrote down
[564.10s -> 569.30s]  his third question. That's your funniest story. Kyle wrote down his last question.
[570.02s -> 574.79s]  What's your guilty pleasure? Kyle ripped his page of notes out of the notebook and got up
[574.79s -> 585.02s]  from the desk. Okay. Actually, am I wasting time here? Should I not be doing this? All right. Draw
[585.02s -> 592.10s]  open the side draw of his desk and grab one of the items stored there. Uh, a key. Kyle grabbed
[592.10s -> 600.38s]  the small key he kept in his desk. Cool. This is not bakery simulator anymore. No, it's not.
[600.38s -> 607.94s]  What about use the key? Oh yeah. Get the change to Kyle scooped up the change scattered around.
[607.94s -> 613.37s]  All right. So let's go back to the room. I did everything. Let's go. Okay. We have to exit.
[613.37s -> 620.63s]  I only have four hours. I think I have to leave. Check the lock. I walked over to the strange door
[620.63s -> 626.86s]  in the hallway, but found quickly that the door was walking around eating bugs and sitting in.
[626.86s -> 641.13s]  It's been 30 hours. I have to leave the apartment. Uh, visit the tech store by batteries with change.
[641.13s -> 649.66s]  I can do that. Okay. Now what? Kyle hurried to the set. Sitting across from his host chair was a
[649.66s -> 657.86s]  glamorous woman with an air of genuineness. As Kyle approached her, Rachel looked up and smiled.
[657.86s -> 663.78s]  Okay. Good evening, Kyle. She said, looking him in the eyes. I've been looking forward to being here.
[663.78s -> 670.86s]  Last second batteries. That's right. Kyle responded. Um, well, this is the funny like,
[670.86s -> 675.72s]  this is the funny answer. So we're going to do the regular answer. And I as well. Rachel
[675.80s -> 682.47s]  answered. Kyle extending his hand and greeting. You are a most welcome guest. Shake hands. After
[682.47s -> 686.79s]  other mild exchanges of pleasantries, Kyle and Rachel were prompted to take their places for
[686.79s -> 691.83s]  the broadcast. Okay. The moment after seating, the studio lights brightened and the cameras clicked
[691.83s -> 700.60s]  on start broadcast. Good evening, everyone. Said Kyle looking at the camera. Welcome back to stay
[700.60s -> 710.26s]  up late with Kyle. Kyle vomited all of the horrible things he had eaten earlier onto the floor.
[710.26s -> 715.14s]  Rachel looked at Kyle concerned, gave a couple coughs and decided to play it cool and keep the
[715.14s -> 723.56s]  show running. Kyle stopped, then vomited again, then continued with a shaky voice. Tonight,
[723.56s -> 731.14s]  I have the pleasure of interviewing the lovely Rachel may who needs no more introduction.
[731.14s -> 736.82s]  Kyle motioned to Rachel who smiled and waved at the camera. Hello, Kyle. She said, I'm glad to be
[736.82s -> 747.05s]  here. Well, you finally fixed your mic a lot to discuss. So we might as well dive right in,
[747.05s -> 752.31s]  finally said Kyle. All right, let's go. I'm very ready, said Rachel with a winning smile.
[752.31s -> 758.25s]  I can't just draw. Kyle produced the notes he had taken earlier. All right. You're eating a whole egg.
[758.25s -> 765.69s]  Hey, Rachel ever eaten a raw egg whole? Asked Kyle. I'm like shell and all. Asked Rachel.
[765.69s -> 772.22s]  Kyle continued. I had like a lot. It's really bad, though. So sometimes I spit it back up.
[772.22s -> 783.75s]  You guys want to hear my mouth going like there was a silence. It actually gets easier the more
[783.75s -> 791.99s]  you do it. Continued Kyle without losing momentum. So don't start. I say Rachel chose not to end.
[791.99s -> 794.63s]  Where the fuck do we end up? Where are we? Where are we? Where are we? Where are we?
[794.63s -> 800.94s]  I think the story I always remember is the first time I tried to make dinner for my family.
[800.94s -> 808.62s]  In the soup I made, I swapped out the water with milk and tipped the whole jar of salt in the pot.
[808.62s -> 814.87s]  While my family was sick from trying to eat it, I swiped their things and locked myself in my room.
[814.87s -> 823.69s]  OK. Rachel laughed elegantly. Kyle decided to move on. Kyle asked another question.
[823.69s -> 828.17s]  What's your guilty pleasure? We all have one. What's your guilty pleasure?
[828.17s -> 866.10s]  Hold on. Let me do this right. You need to be able to see the microphone.
[866.10s -> 881.03s]  Then I got to be like this. Ready? Well, that's an easy answer, said Rachel,
[881.03s -> 889.93s]  dipping pickles in chocolate sauce. It might sound strange, but it's tangy and sweet at the same time.
[889.93s -> 895.59s]  I eat it far too often. Rachel smiled sweetly.
[895.59s -> 899.27s]  After reading his final question, Kyle looked up from his paper.
[901.00s -> 905.08s]  Well, Rachel, he said, I think that's all I was planning on asking you.
[906.81s -> 910.49s]  If that's the case, Kyle, may I ask you something in return?
[910.49s -> 916.86s]  Asked Rachel, smiling one more time. Why exactly did you decide to wear a suit of armor today?
[918.46s -> 922.54s]  Before Kyle could answer, the cameras shut down. The broadcast was over.
[923.34s -> 926.90s]  Kyle returned home knowing the interview had gone well.
[929.72s -> 943.42s]  But as he lay in bed and drifted to sleep, he felt that perhaps something was still missing.
[947.38s -> 965.32s]  Did I lose? He's moving like a TikToker. I'm having fun doing this. Can I do the
[966.52s -> 969.32s]  I'm doing the voices thing still? Is this still funny to you?
[970.12s -> 986.97s]  That was the most unfunny bit. That's welcome. Okay, I'm going to do it one more time.
[986.97s -> 991.42s]  Okay, one more time. That's it. I'm going to get really animated.
[991.42s -> 1028.09s]  Kyle hurried to the set. Sitting across from his host chair was a glamorous woman with an
[1028.09s -> 1033.61s]  air of genuineness. As Kyle approached her, Rachel looked up and smiled.
[1035.83s -> 1040.39s]  Good evening, Kyle, she said, looking him in the eyes. I've been looking forward to being here.
[1042.52s -> 1051.56s]  Kyle responded. Kyle stretched his arms wide, tilted his neck upwards and was interrupted by
[1051.56s -> 1058.39s]  his producer telling him and Rachel that it was time to start the show. Kyle shoved his producer
[1058.39s -> 1070.98s]  out of the way, spread his arms wide and began to scream loudly. He began to rotate slowly,
[1070.98s -> 1075.54s]  screaming throughout, lightly brushing his hands against the faces of Rachel and his producer.
[1085.10s -> 1090.54s]  After several minutes, Kyle was finished. He slowly put his hands to his sides and smiled.
[1093.62s -> 1100.84s]  I'm ready, said Kyle. Rachel blinked at Kyle, shrugged and walked over to her seat.
[1102.58s -> 1106.26s]  A moment after seating, the studio lights brightened and the cameras clicked on.
[1107.56s -> 1112.92s]  Good evening, everyone, said Kyle, looking at the camera. Welcome back to Stay Up Late with Kyle.
[1114.30s -> 1118.14s]  Kyle vomited all of the horrible things he had eaten earlier onto the floor.
[1119.78s -> 1124.66s]  Rachel looked at Kyle, concerned, gave a couple coughs and decided to play it cool and keep the
[1124.66s -> 1130.79s]  show running. Kyle stopped, then vomited again, then continued with a shaky voice.
[1132.31s -> 1139.11s]  Tonight, I have the pleasure of interviewing the lovely Rachel May, who needs no more introduction.
[1140.60s -> 1143.72s]  Kyle motioned to Rachel, who smiled and waved at the camera.
[1143.72s -> 1146.60s]  Hello, Kyle. She said, I'm glad to be here.
[1151.91s -> 1157.48s]  Why would sound come out and I don't move my mouth? All right, I'm done. I'm done with this one.
[1158.20s -> 1166.07s]  Fuck, I want to play this game, though. I kind of want to. Let me just play it for a minute.
[1166.07s -> 1182.12s]  Let me play the game for a minute. It's actually very well done voice acting.
[1182.12s -> 1190.09s]  Well, I'm sure we'll have a lot to discuss. So we might as well dive right in, said Kyle.
[1190.09s -> 1194.09s]  This is not bakery. No, this is not still bakery simulator. Wait, I'm still like,
[1195.21s -> 1204.86s]  voice. Hold on. This is the same person, the same guy that did Gabriel. He did who did the bosses
[1204.86s -> 1209.46s]  from ultra kill. Are you shitting me? I told you that fucking guy was talented.
[1214.34s -> 1223.74s]  What happened? Why does this look so weird? No, this looks what happened. Oh, there we go.
[1223.74s -> 1236.78s]  Okay, I'm going to play. I'm going to play for like 10 minutes. Can I play? Leave me alone.
[1236.78s -> 1245.43s]  I'm playing. I'm very ready, said Rachel with a winning smile. Kyle produced the notes he had
[1245.43s -> 1255.37s]  taken earlier. Okay, I'm not starting with this. I'm not starting with this. What's your guilty
[1255.37s -> 1264.46s]  pleasure? We all have one. What's your guilty pleasure? Oh, well, that's an easy answer,
[1264.46s -> 1274.98s]  said Rachel, dipping pickles in chocolate sauce. That's really not that weird. That's really not
[1274.98s -> 1282.65s]  that weird. It might sound strange, but it's tangy and sweet at the same time. I eat it far too often.
[1282.65s -> 1286.57s]  Rachel smiled sweetly. People put all kinds of weird shit on pickles. Okay,
[1288.47s -> 1293.91s]  Kyle asked another question. What's a funny story? You've been involved in a lot of different things,
[1293.91s -> 1300.79s]  said Kyle. But what's your funniest story? Well, that's a great question, Kyle, said Rachel.
[1302.46s -> 1307.10s]  I think the story I always remember is the first time I tried to make dinner for my family.
[1307.10s -> 1314.50s]  Okay. In the soup I made, I swapped out the water with milk and tipped the whole jar of salt in the
[1314.50s -> 1321.16s]  pot. Oh, while my family was sick from trying to eat it, I swiped their things and locked myself
[1321.16s -> 1330.26s]  in my room. Oh, that's what I missed and I skipped. Rachel laughed elegantly. Kyle decided to move.
[1330.34s -> 1334.82s]  Yeah, he moved on. I asked another question. Are you a mother? Rachel, I and many others. Did I do
[1334.82s -> 1341.06s]  something wrong? To know, are you a mother, Kyle? Well, being a single woman with a career, she
[1341.06s -> 1349.24s]  answered. That's not something that has crossed my mind. Who is this again? Who is this? Who is
[1349.24s -> 1356.46s]  this person? Rachel smiled genuinely at Kyle. Re-do the whole game. Oh, right. Very reasonable indeed,
[1356.46s -> 1364.50s]  said Kyle. Kyle asked, Hey Rachel, have you ever eaten a raw egg whole? Asked Kyle. Um, like
[1364.50s -> 1370.66s]  shell and all? Asked Rachel. Kyle continued. I have, it's bad. I think I spit it back up.
[1370.66s -> 1375.14s]  There was a silence. It actually gets easier the more you do it. Yeah, I remember this.
[1375.14s -> 1380.58s]  Rachel chose not to answer. After reading. Okay. Well, Rachel. That's how we're planning.
[1380.58s -> 1387.06s]  If that's the case, Kyle, may I ask you something in return? Oh, why exactly did you decide to wear
[1387.14s -> 1392.98s]  a suit of armor today? Okay. Before Kyle could answer, the camera shut down. Kyle returned.
[1392.98s -> 1398.02s]  All right. I screwed the whole thing up. I'm going back. Repeat. Reset. No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[1398.02s -> 1404.36s]  Kyle. No, no, no, no, no, no. I screwed it up. As Kyle approached her, Rachel looked up and smiled.
[1404.36s -> 1411.06s]  Okay, here we go. I'm going to wither away. Kyle decided to stay put and wither away. I wasted way
[1411.06s -> 1418.25s]  too much time withered successfully and died. Wait, what is it? Kyle is now a ghost. This does not
[1418.25s -> 1431.14s]  relieve him of his responsibilities. Oh, okay. All right. So what do I need from here? I'm going
[1431.14s -> 1436.36s]  to choose an outfit. Kyle decided to take some time to choose the perfect outfit, knowing how
[1436.36s -> 1443.29s]  important appearance is. Kyle miraculously crammed his dumpy body into the suit. The chest pockets
[1443.29s -> 1453.90s]  were filled with random knickknacks. Okay. So now I think I'm going to leave. Wait, sit at the desk
[1453.90s -> 1465.82s]  and get the batteries, right? Change. Kyle scooped up the change. Get out, get out, get out, get out.
[1465.82s -> 1473.83s]  Okay. Move to the kitchen. Open the fridge. Kyle opened the fridge, intending to find something
[1473.83s -> 1479.51s]  to eat. Eat crust on the fridge wall. Eat the fridge. How do you eat? You can't eat the fridge.
[1479.51s -> 1488.34s]  Can I? No, I would eat condiments. That'll get like all the gross. I didn't brush my teeth yet
[1488.34s -> 1494.58s]  out of my mouth. If there's one thing that will cover that up, it's a bottle of ketchup.
[1494.58s -> 1499.22s]  Kyle started to grab condiments from the fridge, squirting them into his mouth with both hands.
[1500.15s -> 1505.38s]  Okay. Ketchup, horseradish, and mayonnaise entered Kyle's mouth at a rate that soon
[1505.38s -> 1513.42s]  overwhelmed his ability to swallow. That actually sounds good. I'm not kidding. Kyle spewed the
[1513.42s -> 1519.26s]  excess condiment slurry across the kitchen, covering the furniture and walls. Okay. Kyle
[1519.26s -> 1524.30s]  continued until all of the condiments had been emptied. Not to eat by itself, but just put that
[1524.30s -> 1531.74s]  on something. That doesn't sound like a bad combo. All right. I got 10 hours. Check the pantry. Kyle
[1531.74s -> 1538.36s]  wanted to access the pantry, but found it was locked with a small keyhole. Mayo, horseradish,
[1538.36s -> 1545.59s]  and ketchup. That's probably... Horseradish is delicious with anything, and ketchup and mayonnaise
[1545.59s -> 1550.22s]  is just Thousand Island dressing. So it's just Thousand Island with a little bit of kick to it.
[1550.22s -> 1567.38s]  What's the problem with that? All right. The key is for the pantry, but Thousand Island sucks.
[1567.38s -> 1573.06s]  Big Mac sauce. Yeah. Kyle wanted to... All right. Yeah, I can't. All right. So let's go back to the
[1573.06s -> 1582.09s]  hallway. I only have a few... You gotta get out of the house immediately. Oh, I can haunt.
[1582.09s -> 1591.40s]  Kyle felt a sudden pull on his heart. Had he abandoned his job as a ghost? Was he fulfilling
[1591.40s -> 1599.34s]  his spooky, ethereal role that he'd accepted while lying in bed this morning? Kyle realized he had
[1599.34s -> 1607.05s]  no other choice. He must spend his day spooking about. Okay. Kyle decided he should make a plan
[1607.05s -> 1614.87s]  about who or where he should spook. At the interview. Kyle thought that it would be best
[1614.87s -> 1620.78s]  to continue his daily course. That makes sense. But with a twist. Today, he would still go to
[1620.78s -> 1626.04s]  his studio, but instead of conducting an interview, he would haunt. Thousand Island is incredible.
[1626.04s -> 1632.87s]  Yeah. What are you guys talking... Thousand Island is good on lots of stuff. Excitedly,
[1632.87s -> 1637.91s]  Kyle made his way to the studio early to find the best spot to conduct his ghostly duties.
[1637.91s -> 1641.99s]  I don't love Thousand Island dressing, but I don't hate it. The studio was empty.
[1642.07s -> 1647.70s]  Being so early, the crew wouldn't arrive for several hours. Okay. Kyle gleefully skipped
[1647.70s -> 1653.21s]  around the building, finding the best spot for himself to hide. Okay. After searching for some
[1653.21s -> 1659.69s]  time, Kyle decided to hide behind the guest chair. Okay. Rubens, yep. Kyle quickly placed himself
[1659.69s -> 1666.52s]  down and drew his legs to his chest. Soon, the crew began to arrive and set up for the interview
[1666.52s -> 1673.37s]  that night. Invisible to all senses, Kyle went undetected. He watched as cameras were set up,
[1673.37s -> 1679.64s]  screens were turned on, and pages were flipped. Within an hour, Rachel walked into the studio.
[1679.64s -> 1687.14s]  This is it. Hey, everyone. Said Rachel, smiling kindly. I'm ready to get prepped. Who do I need
[1687.14s -> 1694.01s]  to talk to first? Kyle's producer approached her. Thanks for being here, Rachel. You should
[1694.01s -> 1698.58s]  really talk to Andrea about makeup first, and then wait for when Kyle arrives. Here I come.
[1698.58s -> 1704.34s]  Kyle, knowing he was duping everyone, began to giggle uncontrollably. He's doing a little
[1704.34s -> 1707.86s]  bit of trolling. Yeah, I'm doing a little bit of trolling, whatever. It was then that he,
[1707.86s -> 1715.21s]  like clockwork, ceased to be a ghost. Why? The studio grew silent. Everyone stared at Kyle,
[1715.21s -> 1721.58s]  head down, clutching his legs and giggling at the floor. What is TF? Kyle froze. He had found
[1721.58s -> 1727.70s]  himself in a situation he had not encountered before. Kyle started to crawl out of the studio
[1727.70s -> 1735.42s]  on all fours, hoping his small form would avoid attracting more attention. Why can I not see that?
[1735.42s -> 1739.34s]  Everyone wordlessly watched as Kyle slowly made his way across the stage,
[1739.34s -> 1744.28s]  through the production set and out the door. As soon as he was outside the studio,
[1744.28s -> 1749.35s]  Kyle broke into an all out sprint. I still have money. Kyle made his way back to his apartment
[1749.35s -> 1755.06s]  as quickly as possible. Kyle sat in his kitchen and processed what had happened during his day.
[1755.06s -> 1762.60s]  Am I still dead? He vowed that he would never haunt anything again. How many endings are there?
[1765.90s -> 1775.02s]  Dude, Kyle is literally me. How we do we got? Oh, we got we have we have the wrestling one.
[1775.02s -> 1791.74s]  Should I try the wrestling quiz? I feel like I would do pretty good on it. All right, let me get
[1791.74s -> 1803.32s]  it. I'll try I'll try it. I can't promise that I'm going to do well. But I think I'll get probably
[1803.32s -> 1822.06s]  half of these. You have a reptilian brain. Okay, sparkle. Let's get it. How do I do this? Tic Tac
[1822.06s -> 1832.47s]  trivia. Oh, this is but wait, there's a lot of six letter word in 1980s songs. Okay. Television cakes.
[1833.46s -> 1840.74s]  This looks fun. Pick that movie. This looks fun. This is fun, isn't it? Let's pick that movie.
[1847.26s -> 1860.79s]  Dude, let's go pick that movie. Hold on. Um, how does it work? Let's pick that movie. Can you pick
[1860.79s -> 1881.69s]  the movie that fits each clue? Alright, I'm excited. Alright, hold on. Let me get this set up.
[1881.69s -> 1906.70s]  The movie quiz. Okay. How do I where is it? Let me close this. So that 100 people left. That's
[1906.70s -> 1914.73s]  all right. It's fine. Where the fuck is this window? I have so much trouble capturing windows
[1914.73s -> 1926.18s]  on stream. It never seems to work the way that I want it to. Where is it? I can see it in my
[1926.18s -> 1952.87s]  preview, but I can't hold on. Okay, it should be there. Come on. I want to play. It won't show up.
[1959.56s -> 1963.72s]  I can see it in the preview, but I can't see it actually on the the window. You're doing your
[1963.72s -> 1976.76s]  best. Yeah. Make it work. I'm trying. What do you think I'm doing? There it is. So what the fuck?
[1976.76s -> 1998.36s]  OBS, what are you doing? It says it's got it. I don't get it. I'll try it again. Hello, it's my
[1998.36s -> 2021.91s]  birthday. Someone help dad. It should I should be pulling this. It's just not. Come on. What the
[2021.91s -> 2038.46s]  heck? Hold on. Um, let me see if I can do this. Every time this happens, I have to restart OBS.
[2038.46s -> 2047.83s]  And I really don't want to do that. I might have to though, because I think it's frozen.
[2047.83s -> 2054.06s]  All right. All right. All right. I, I'll be right back. I physically can't capture this.
[2054.06s -> 2059.90s]  Unless I restart OBS. None of you leave. If any of you leave, I'll know. If any of you leave,
[2059.98s -> 2065.59s]  I'll know. Don't go anywhere. If any of you leave, I will know. I'll know. There's 20,000 people.
[2065.59s -> 2070.31s]  They'd be 20,000 people when I come back. I'll know. I'll be back in 30 seconds. I just have
[2070.31s -> 2073.85s]  to turn it off and turn it on again. I'll know. Don't you dare.
