[1.34s -> 11.74s]  Hey, sorry, I just like accidentally slammed. Sorry for slamming. Hi. Hey, how are you?
[12.38s -> 19.40s]  You're late, I know. Yeah, I may have uh, I may have really, really overshot the hole. I'm gonna
[19.40s -> 26.60s]  fix my sleep schedule in 12 hours thing, but I got close. I got really close. You know I got close
[27.48s -> 32.60s]  because there's absolutely no way there'd be a stream at like 12 30 specific if I didn't get
[32.60s -> 44.26s]  close. So I got close. We're not starting, it's not four. Another reason why we're starting um,
[44.26s -> 52.90s]  three to four hours early and typically about the 4 p.m plus time period is because today is going
[52.90s -> 59.82s]  to be a double header. We're going to play Mario Golf for a little while to pretend that I don't
[60.86s -> 67.82s]  just play Elden Ring. It's a way for people to scroll by and see German985 currently live
[67.82s -> 74.62s]  playing Mario Golf. Okay, all right. He's cool. He's variety, right? Like it's, I don't, I mean,
[74.62s -> 82.14s]  I'm not going to click on that, but I know he's doing it. We're in EU. Is EU? Yeah, is that what
[82.14s -> 89.91s]  I mean? It's for people to understand that I don't just play Elden Ring and then we're going to play
[89.91s -> 95.59s]  Elden Ring. So this is just for the scrollers, the first like four or five hours of the stream.
[96.31s -> 103.05s]  I'm going to take a break, a real break, one that I don't, I don't think I've ever done on this channel.
[104.65s -> 110.50s]  I have never done what I'm going to do today. So I'm very, very, I'm very intrigued to see how this
[110.50s -> 124.18s]  works. Somewhere in the next four or five hours, I'm going to put up the BRB screen with some text
[124.18s -> 133.96s]  on it saying that I'll be back in like 20 to 30 minutes. We're going to do a legit 20 minute break
[134.52s -> 142.73s]  halfway through here. We're going to come back somewhere around that, whatever that is,
[143.98s -> 155.46s]  and do Elden Ring for the rest of the night. Your views are going to plummet. I mean, yeah,
[155.46s -> 160.23s]  they are. Of course they are. But this will be a good, this is a nice little science experiment,
[160.23s -> 174.34s]  don't you think? I'm very curious how this works. Intermission Andy. Yeah. So we're going to do about
[174.34s -> 180.02s]  four or five hours now and then four or five hours later, bringing us to an Omega time period
[180.66s -> 187.62s]  of about 10 hours or so today. Maybe less, maybe more, depending. I also have to get ready for the
[187.62s -> 193.80s]  streamer awards because I haven't even prepared at all. So this will be the last stream you see
[193.80s -> 200.47s]  on this channel for a little while. I will be at the streamer awards. You can watch it. I'm sure
[200.47s -> 209.16s]  you'll be able to pick me out of the crowd at some point. I will be there. So as of today,
[209.96s -> 225.11s]  I will see you on this channel after today, next week. Oh, fucking Poggies. Yeah. Poggies. Poggies.
[227.98s -> 231.26s]  All right. I'm going to have no cam on because this is the first time in like three weeks that
[231.26s -> 237.02s]  I've been able to have no shirt on when I stream. So I'm going to, I'm doing that. I'll have a cam
[237.02s -> 241.18s]  on Elden Ring. When I take my break, I'll put a shirt on. So you're going to deal with no cam for
[241.18s -> 245.66s]  like, I don't know, however long I pretend to play Mario golf. Oh, also somebody bet me something in
[245.66s -> 252.06s]  chat. The person that said, Hey dude, play Mario golf is the same person that also said, if you
[252.06s -> 258.62s]  don't give this game at least a seven out of 10, ban me for a month. What I said is, I mean,
[258.62s -> 264.62s]  you're kind of already going up against some pretty intense odds considering that all the Mario sports
[264.62s -> 274.71s]  games are like five or sixes. I mean, like I think I'm going to give this a seven. I don't know if
[274.71s -> 281.22s]  you're going to get a seven out of this. That's a bad take. Well, at least in the last 10 years,
[281.22s -> 286.10s]  Mario Sonic and Olympic games, was that a six? What was it? Let's be real. Let's go. Come on.
[286.10s -> 289.78s]  Let's be honest. What, what would, what would you give a score to Mario and Sonic at the Olympic
[289.78s -> 298.78s]  games? What is it? Is it a six or a seven? It's a five, seven for nostalgia. Okay. But that doesn't
[298.78s -> 309.98s]  count. It'd be probably a six. It was a six for the Wii. Okay. All right. What's, what's the last
[309.98s -> 324.26s]  Mario sports game? Mario tennis for the Switch. That's like a six. That was like a 6.5. I'm seeing
[324.26s -> 330.18s]  a lot of sevens. I'm seeing a lot of sixes and sevens. So how is that a bad take when it's
[330.18s -> 338.82s]  everybody's take in the chat? Besides like, at least like, ow. No, you can't put stuff in the Wii.
[339.46s -> 343.22s]  You guys keep forgetting the Wii is more than, the Wii is like fucking 15 years old now.
[344.81s -> 350.89s]  I'm talking about like current gen and a little bit of last gen, like the last five to 10 years.
[350.89s -> 362.74s]  You give me a Mario sports game that was like a nine. Not gonna happen. They're fun. They're not
[362.74s -> 376.14s]  bad games. What about Mario Strikers? Yeah, that game's fantastic. I'm looking forward to the next
[376.14s -> 381.58s]  one. That might, that actually might be the first like Mario sports game in five to 10 years.
[382.63s -> 389.27s]  That actually is like a nine for me. It could be. That game was absolutely unbelievable.
[389.27s -> 400.62s]  Mario Strikers charged. Honestly, I think my opinion just soured just based on
[401.58s -> 408.39s]  my Mario tennis. Like right now on my screen, I just see Mario with a tennis racket.
[409.11s -> 419.48s]  That's fucking infuriating me. That's a tennis racket and I'm pissed off about it.
[419.48s -> 425.48s]  Anytime Mario wears regular clothes, just like that aren't his overalls and his shirt,
[425.48s -> 429.88s]  like when he wears like just like pants, like suit pants, it pisses, I get mad because I know
[429.88s -> 438.38s]  it's either a tennis game or a golf game. I'm already mad. All right, maybe I should stop.
[449.45s -> 455.40s]  Jesus Christ. All right, what should I do? I don't want to like do all this. I want to like
[455.40s -> 464.86s]  play golf. I'm just gonna play golf. I know there's like an RPG mode in this game, right?
[464.86s -> 479.13s]  Do I really want to do that? I'll go do golf adventure. I'm not playing ranked. Golf adventure.
[479.13s -> 486.66s]  Okay, so I have to make a me. Is that how this works? There I am. I'm already made.
[487.38s -> 497.98s]  Dominant hand is set to right. Yeah, that's fine. How do you blonde hair? I don't know. I made it
[497.98s -> 525.85s]  in 10 seconds. The scan lines. Why the scan line? Oh, it's on TV. Hey, you turn it off at the worst
[525.85s -> 535.64s]  possible time. Erdo. Oh, it looked like Mario just won. Isn't that the end of the tourney?
[538.04s -> 542.76s]  Did you see how he won? That was ridiculous. I need to see a replay, some slow mo. Don't I
[542.76s -> 550.04s]  beat the shit out of these people on a daily basis? Why would they be? Why are they like fans of mine?
[550.04s -> 559.75s]  Okay. Oh, sorry, Chuck. But remember the welcome ceremony tomorrow is more important than watching
[559.75s -> 566.17s]  TV. He he he Berto is right. We should all get some good sleep tonight. I feel like we're going
[566.17s -> 570.92s]  to need it. Thank you. How wonderful to have at least one sensible rookie in the house.
[572.90s -> 575.54s]  Oh, these are players. Okay, I thought they were just like people watching.
[577.61s -> 582.49s]  I'll sleep just fine. What about you? I didn't even know ghosts could sleep. You don't just
[582.49s -> 588.74s]  fall through the bed. Chuck, I feel like that's a rude question to ask a ghost. Anyway, I guess
[588.74s -> 592.98s]  I'll go to bed too. I want to make a good impression at the welcome ceremony tomorrow.
[594.44s -> 600.30s]  That's a good idea, dear. I know you're hoping to be one of the standouts in this rookie class.
[600.30s -> 604.06s]  Gosh, you can't out drive me. Sorry, Toadette, but you're always going to be playing catch up
[604.06s -> 609.26s]  to the real heavy hitters. Ha ha ha. Excuse me. You can't always win with power alone. You know,
[609.26s -> 613.61s]  you've got to keep a level head and no one to lay up. Happy Gilmore would say otherwise.
[617.14s -> 620.10s]  You've got both in wrong. Finesse is the name of the game.
[624.95s -> 634.47s]  Who's this guy? Oh, it's me. It feels weird. I feel like I'm in a sims house. Right. Oh,
[634.47s -> 641.08s]  it's you. We've been waiting for you. Come join us, please. Everyone, please allow me to introduce
[641.08s -> 648.89s]  the final rookie in your group. Jeremy. Who's that? You're a rookie too? How much did you
[648.89s -> 656.01s]  over here? I mean, nice to meet you. It's the golf association called to let us know that one more
[656.01s -> 661.61s]  rookie would be arriving late. Now they're here. All right. All right. So how far can you drive it,
[661.61s -> 667.05s]  Rook? You want to tee it up and see? Don't mind Chuck. He's got an oversized driver for a brain.
[667.05s -> 671.16s]  Come on, everyone. You'll be all learning together. You guys wanted me to play the fucking
[671.16s -> 678.06s]  RPG mode. It's gonna take like four hours to get started. I could have already driven the ball
[678.06s -> 685.80s]  400 yards by now. The name's charging Chuck. I hit the long ball. Boom. Don't matter where it goes.
[685.80s -> 691.67s]  As long as it goes far giddy up. I'm Toadette. It's great to meet another student of the game.
[691.67s -> 698.81s]  I hope we can all learn from each other. I'm boo. Boo. He he. Edit any other characters that
[699.37s -> 703.13s]  every human on earth has seen more than a thousand times that we need introductions for.
[703.13s -> 708.25s]  I'm being really like rude to this game. All right. Yeah, I'm out of here. I got a lift anyway.
[708.25s -> 713.16s]  If you want to hit up the green, your biceps got to be mean. While I was on my way to bed,
[713.16s -> 717.08s]  the most important thing for strong muscles is recovery. Wait, we do like exercises?
[717.08s -> 722.07s]  I don't understand the obsession with muscles that seems to plague those of you with physical
[722.07s -> 730.73s]  bodies. Anyway, off to bed. He he he. It's quite a crew we have. What am I thinking? You must be
[730.73s -> 738.38s]  exhausted. Why don't you head to your room and get some rest? I'm Birdo, the camphouse mama.
[738.38s -> 745.91s]  You can even call me mama if you want. I wanted to go. Okay. Now your room is the one in the back.
[745.91s -> 759.26s]  We've got the we've got a big welcome ceremony tomorrow. Go get rest. R1, R1, R1, R1. Oh, this
[759.26s -> 768.62s]  is Charging Chuck's room. What's in there? I'm just going to bed. You know what? All right. I
[768.62s -> 773.38s]  got to be very honest with everybody here. Maybe incredibly honest. I don't care about any of this
[773.38s -> 780.23s]  lore. I don't care at all. Zero. I don't want to knock on everybody's door and see what like what
[780.23s -> 786.30s]  they're doing. I don't I don't care. I just don't. I'm sorry. Does that make me like a bad person
[786.30s -> 793.82s]  for not caring about the storyline in Mario Golf? I just want to drive a ball hard. Meet
[793.82s -> 799.40s]  the manager in the front of the clubhouse. They're your friends? They're not my friends. I just moved
[799.40s -> 807.24s]  in. I just moved in five seconds ago. These people don't know who I am. I'm in Boo's room.
[807.24s -> 827.37s]  Let's Charging Chuck up too. You know what? I do I will commend companies like Nintendo and other
[827.37s -> 836.36s]  companies that have tried to make just hey let's play golf a better more interesting kind of fun
[836.36s -> 842.76s]  experience rather than just what you know just turning around at the tee and driving the ball
[842.76s -> 848.07s]  out of bounds like a thousand yards the wrong way and then literally turning the game off because
[848.07s -> 856.89s]  that's what I've done at every golf game I've ever played. Hope you're feeling rested. Did you get a
[856.89s -> 862.98s]  good night's sleep? I did. Oh good. I didn't wake you because you seemed like you really needed the
[862.98s -> 867.66s]  rest but now you're running late for the welcome ceremony. Head outside and straight down the road.
[867.66s -> 883.14s]  Hurry! Why is it pointing there? Okay wait. R1. R1. R1. Just one more thing. Everyone in town knows
[883.22s -> 888.98s]  that we have a new class of rookies starting out so you'll have a lot of eyes on you and expect some
[888.98s -> 897.10s]  pretty high expectations. Let's put your best foot forward. All right. I better not turn all the way
[897.10s -> 914.78s]  100 180 degrees in the wrong direction and drive. I shouldn't do that. Bonnie Greens. It's ugly.
[914.78s -> 927.72s]  This place is filled with talented rookies but let's pump the brakes a bit. Not everyone can be
[927.72s -> 933.90s]  a star on day one. Let's give these. What's wrong with this? Something's wrong. It's something
[933.90s -> 938.46s]  a bit like the aliasing. This is this is looks off. Why does it look so wrong? Is it like the
[938.46s -> 946.42s]  anti-aliasing? Dude the rookie everyone's talking about right? Bonnie Green says world-class
[946.42s -> 955.16s]  practicing courses. Okay. I honestly like I this is a difference than the other Nintendo games.
[956.30s -> 966.73s]  Usually the aliasing doesn't look this bad. Nice to meet you. I'm the head coach. All right. Let's
[966.73s -> 976.55s]  do the ceremony. A 3090. I'm not I'm on a switch right now dude. Come on. Okay. Everyone's here
[976.55s -> 985.46s]  coach. Welcome rookies. Clearly all you know the story history but a minor never hurts. Bonnie
[985.46s -> 994.18s]  Green's golf village is the birthplace of countless legendary golfers. Yeah. Hope you all realize how
[994.18s -> 1000.57s]  lucky you are to get a chance to write your own chapter in the Bonnie Green story. I'm the clubhouse
[1000.57s -> 1005.45s]  manager here and it's my pleasure to welcome you to this rookie class. Now you just met our head
[1005.45s -> 1009.86s]  coach. He has a lot to offer so I hope you all take his lessons. After all he's launched the careers of
[1009.86s -> 1018.09s]  several top players. Hey thanks for that. Now you're all here for a reason. You've got the raw
[1018.09s -> 1022.33s]  talent to make it in life. That doesn't mean it can be easy. I'll help you make sure you make it all.
[1025.90s -> 1031.16s]  Very well then I'll go ahead and pass these out. This is a golf watch. Rookies it'll track your
[1031.16s -> 1038.20s]  stats, record your scores, and a whole lot more. Come on get one. George and Chuck. That's me with
[1038.20s -> 1043.54s]  my watch. I hear you drive the ball a little bit. Let's see if we can't teach you some control. I
[1043.54s -> 1049.27s]  feel like I'm an AI reading this. Control? That gonna help me hit it farther? I want to play as
[1049.27s -> 1062.46s]  that guy. Just smash the A button. I don't care. I don't care about these guys getting their watches.
[1062.46s -> 1071.32s]  I just want my watch. I hear you're a real prodigy but rough around the edges. Just like the fairway
[1071.32s -> 1078.65s]  I guess. Just made that up. All right that's enough for intros. Go ahead and slap those new golf
[1078.65s -> 1084.97s]  watches on your wrists. Can I get the golf watch on? Your data is already in there. Like magic,
[1084.97s -> 1091.18s]  just press on and make sure it looks right. The first screen that comes up should be pretty basic.
[1091.18s -> 1095.42s]  It shows the different aliens you can turn into. This one's a small alien and can get in small
[1095.42s -> 1099.74s]  places and has a high pitched voice. This one is a big strong alien but sometimes it's hard to tell
[1099.74s -> 1105.59s]  which one you're going to get. Just smash it and just be a good tv show. Don't worry about all the
[1105.59s -> 1111.69s]  advanced functions right now okay. Now I'm going to go over the badge system. No no badge system.
[1111.69s -> 1117.85s]  Okay this is actually kind of cool. You see where it says steel badge? One day when you reach the
[1117.85s -> 1126.23s]  top it might say platinum instead. Okay I can go 160 yards. All right so you play tournaments,
[1126.23s -> 1140.38s]  this training, this is leveling up. Yeah that's cool. New member of the team. It's Toad. Hey
[1140.38s -> 1146.06s]  everyone I'm Toad. I've been looking forward to this for quite a long time. Golf is more popular
[1146.06s -> 1152.46s]  than ever in the Mushroom Kingdom. Wasn't that tourney yesterday incredible? But if we want to
[1152.46s -> 1159.11s]  keep the sport interesting we need some green players you see. And I just don't need folks who
[1159.11s -> 1164.95s]  can hit the green. Oh whoa wait. This is crazy. That's all I had to do was like just clear my
[1164.95s -> 1169.35s]  throat. We need some fresh faces on the leaderboards. That's where you all come in. We've scouted each
[1169.35s -> 1181.21s]  of you for your special talents. Maybe you're a big star. That wasn't even a bad impression.
[1181.21s -> 1196.66s]  You know how bad all Toad impressions are? Never mind. Who's my caddy? Have you guys noticed
[1198.15s -> 1201.75s]  that all the Mario characters have gotten regular voices except for that guy?
[1203.83s -> 1210.47s]  All the Mario characters are like whoa hey. And now but this guy's still
[1213.61s -> 1229.94s]  they've never changed it. It's always been that. Oh nice. All right time to play.
[1230.50s -> 1235.75s]  I went up the golf watch. I don't need the golf watch. All right let's go meet the caddy.
[1236.39s -> 1247.67s]  Hi yes I'm Jeremy. I've been waiting for you. All right so you're my caddy so just tell me what
[1247.67s -> 1254.06s]  clubs to use. Okay I'm here for the package. Yes you don't have any idea what I'm talking about
[1254.06s -> 1263.08s]  do you? I'm here to give you your first set of clubs. They're already customized perfectly. Okay
[1263.80s -> 1266.84s]  now when you're playing around here you'll be chasing after your ball and your own two legs
[1266.84s -> 1271.06s]  no carts. I did see that from the trailer. That's probably going to be the fun part of the game.
[1271.78s -> 1281.88s]  We won't load you up with a full set of 14 clubs. I only need three. I never understood all the
[1281.88s -> 1287.26s]  multiple clubs thing in golf. Give me the driver, the putter, and the pitching wedge. That's all I
[1287.26s -> 1293.46s]  need. That's all you're going to see me play with. All right that's enough for me. Go ahead and strap
[1293.46s -> 1305.74s]  on the bag. You got a set of golf clubs. Okay cool. All right I want I need a huge driver.
[1307.69s -> 1316.76s]  Do you guys remember the commercials? Those big huge like titanium rod in the middle drivers.
[1316.76s -> 1322.10s]  They were it was an infomercial for them all the time and that shit was illegal to play within
[1322.10s -> 1330.95s]  tournaments. As the driver master 400 El Diablo driver or something right? And these things they
[1330.95s -> 1334.95s]  were you couldn't use them in tournaments. You couldn't use them like and play with them in a
[1335.51s -> 1343.40s]  actual setting. The thing was like it was almost a foot long and it had this huge piece of titanium
[1343.40s -> 1348.15s]  in the middle and it was like guaranteed to like it was like a corked bat. I used to see that
[1348.15s -> 1353.30s]  commercial all the fucking time. You physically couldn't even play with it unless you like were
[1353.30s -> 1364.78s]  just driving with like you know the funny somebody dickhead friends in the driving range. Satan
[1364.78s -> 1371.72s]  driver. I swear to god it was something like that. All right so I'm just gonna go this way.
[1371.72s -> 1391.74s]  Take some lessons. All right here we go. I'm ready. Let's go. You want to review the basics
[1391.74s -> 1396.90s]  of hitting a shot. I mean I kind of need to know what I'm doing. All right that aims. That aims.
[1396.90s -> 1404.04s]  Yep yep yep. That shows the overhead view. Very cool. The inner circle shows where the ball will
[1404.92s -> 1413.30s]  Okay and then the translucent outside border shows where it will roll. Okay some of the shots carry
[1413.30s -> 1417.93s]  and run equals its total distance. Distance is also affected by shot power wind speed and direction
[1417.93s -> 1428.42s]  and elevation changes. Okay there's a gauge. Press it. Bing bing. There it is. Okay by the way you'll
[1428.42s -> 1433.93s]  need 60 points to pass this lesson. All right I got it. I got it. This is gonna be easy. Easy.
[1433.93s -> 1443.40s]  It's simple. Let's go. I got a pro controller in my hand right now. All right you want to get
[1443.40s -> 1450.70s]  precise. The blue section of the target will score you the most points. Okay of course that
[1450.70s -> 1455.18s]  isn't always the best spot to be. That will depend on where the wind is. Okay. Aim for the blue area.
[1455.74s -> 1465.59s]  Okay cool. Let's take a look. There it is. So that's 160 yards. We're gonna go right here.
[1466.23s -> 1491.24s]  What was wrong with that? All right 10 points. I did it. Okay nice. Yeah I want it to roll. I don't
[1491.24s -> 1497.50s]  want to do it. You know if it's 160 yards away you don't hit the ball 160 yards. Well that was
[1497.50s -> 1509.27s]  bullshit. That was actually bullshit. Why have you not turned around yet? Because this is the
[1509.27s -> 1517.46s]  fucking practice area dude. I'm not gonna do that in the practice zone. I'm not gonna turn around.
[1518.10s -> 1535.93s]  The point is to hit it exactly 160 yards. The point is to get it into the 10. That's not gonna
[1535.93s -> 1550.66s]  be enough. I'm undershooting it a little. How did that feel? Were you able to hit the shots where
[1550.66s -> 1556.60s]  you wanted? Yeah. Next we'll hit five more shots but now we're going to get more aggressive and
[1556.60s -> 1563.78s]  set up for a birdie. Okay let's get more aggressive. All right sure. So I need to
[1563.78s -> 1581.96s]  smash this as hard as I can. Are you playing the golf tutorial? I was gonna jump into golf
[1581.96s -> 1588.79s]  but people said do the adventure mode because they wanted to hear a toad yell at them for
[1588.79s -> 1607.91s]  fucking an hour. All right that was good. I can shape the shot too. This is fast forward.
[1607.91s -> 1627.46s]  Oh there is. Okay yeah let's go. How can I shape? Let's see. Oh you can curve it. Oh shit. I can't
[1627.46s -> 1639.90s]  wait to try to curve a ball around the entire forest. All right that's 60 points. Nice. Do I
[1639.90s -> 1656.94s]  level up? Okay power has leveled up. Cool. Oh yeah yeah yeah I wanted to be power. Well you crushed
[1656.94s -> 1660.52s]  it. You got to play it safe too. Not to take anything away from this performance but you've
[1660.52s -> 1665.08s]  always got to improve. Good job Jeremy. Keep improving the accuracy of your shots and you
[1665.08s -> 1678.28s]  need to pay attention to both carry and run. I don't care. Take some lessons. From who? Power
[1678.28s -> 1685.77s]  only. That's what I'm doing. I'm going to put every single point into distance and just have
[1685.77s -> 1697.34s]  the giant infomercial driver. That's illegal and I'm just gonna win every tournament. 30 yard
[1697.34s -> 1705.50s]  approach. A flat ground using your wedge. Okay. Get the ball into the green. I know how it works.
[1717.48s -> 1725.10s]  Me strong. All right I got my pitching wedge so you want to pretty much just pitch it on there.
[1726.06s -> 1746.07s]  Almost a hole in one. Nice. Yeah this is simple. We need a me strong golf swing.
[1752.74s -> 1768.30s]  Nice. All right approach shots are key to scoring well. We're on pretty level ground it seems. Okay
[1768.30s -> 1780.47s]  with 30 yards of elevation to gain at count four. Got to carry a little farther. No I just get the
[1780.47s -> 1793.27s]  ball into the hole. That's all I need to know. Nothing else matters. Just get it in. Don't tell
[1793.27s -> 1816.84s]  me well you see this elevation in it. No just put ball into hole. All right. Nice.
[1820.22s -> 1833.66s]  Why are you still here? All right we're uphill now. Hole is one yard downhill and 98 feet away.
[1834.30s -> 1846.46s]  Okay all right all right all right get out of my way. Easy. Right in. That was good. That was good.
[1847.10s -> 1857.67s]  He's gonna say okay every time. Okay that's the streamer curse. Don't you
[1857.67s -> 1862.39s]  understand? That's the- I don't want more than three or four seconds to go by without any sound
[1862.39s -> 1872.28s]  effects. Think about that. Five seconds of no talking is like it's like streamer dog years.
[1872.28s -> 1875.48s]  It's like it might as well be 30 minutes. It's like five straight minutes.
[1886.22s -> 1898.10s]  Fuck. Okay you want to do the- all right I'll do- I gotta just do the- let me just do this.
[1898.98s -> 1912.89s]  Well the goal is to get the ball into the thing. Kitboga! Kitboga! Coming in for a raid.
[1913.45s -> 1925.08s]  What's up Kit? Welcome everybody. We're currently playing Mario Golf. Uh it's- this is just breaking
[1925.08s -> 1933.38s]  it up a little bit because I'm going to play an Elden Ring later but thanks Kit. Hope you had a
[1933.38s -> 1945.13s]  good stream. Hope it was eventful. More Elden Ring? That's a nerd game. Well just watch this
[1945.13s -> 1955.75s]  stream then. This is gonna be two today. Just playing this as the meme. No actually this is-
[1955.75s -> 1960.15s]  I'm genuinely- when I saw the trailer for this I genuinely thought it was uh interesting looking.
[1960.79s -> 1970.33s]  All right so I gotta be careful. So this is- we're going up. I gotta hit it a little bit harder. Just
[1970.33s -> 1991.59s]  a little bit. Not very much. Okay. Okay. So this is not just gonna be golf. This is gonna be um
[1991.59s -> 1999.05s]  what are those? What are those guys called? The Stompers? What are they called? They're gonna be
[1999.05s -> 2010.17s]  all over the green and stuff right? This one's downhill all the way. All right but that was not
[2010.17s -> 2029.69s]  enough at all. That's fine. Nice on. Derma hates video games. I don't hate video games.
[2030.33s -> 2044.34s]  This is to change it up a little. All right. Ride the rookie course. Let's go. It's time to go.
[2044.34s -> 2048.62s]  Let's go for it. All right was- was the person said if this- if you don't think this game is
[2048.62s -> 2054.04s]  at least a seven out of ten then you should ban me for a month? Um you're about to find out if I
[2054.04s -> 2069.27s]  actually like this game. Okay this is the rookie course. This is cute though. It actually is cute.
[2069.27s -> 2083.50s]  I actually like this. I don't know how a shift can affect- no. Oh fuck off. Stop calling me. Three
[2083.50s -> 2100.76s]  holes. Finishing five over par or better to pass. That's a pass? It's like a super bogey. All right
[2100.76s -> 2106.12s]  11 mile per hour wind downhill downhill slope 7.3 yards. We don't care about any of those. We're
[2106.12s -> 2131.26s]  just gonna drive over them. All right. I think I got a pretty good idea. Yeah it's funny. He did
[2131.26s -> 2153.69s]  the funny thing right? I love somebody in the chat just wrote. Oh my god he's so funny. That
[2153.69s -> 2169.18s]  was not bad. All right now how far here? 120 yards downhill? The driver. Can I use the driver on the
[2169.18s -> 2185.46s]  green? If you can that's really funny. Yeah you can. Can you fucking imagine somebody doing this?
[2193.83s -> 2201.59s]  All right that's- I got one more stroke and I'm good. I got it.
[2203.43s -> 2225.32s]  Oh no. I think I can get this in one go. Ready? No not quite. I'm gonna go this way though.
[2225.96s -> 2237.32s]  Play seriously. I'm gonna- I'm doing it right now. He's gonna fail the rookie course. I'm not gonna
[2237.32s -> 2246.97s]  fail the rookie course. Watch. I can hit the tree. I feel like that's gonna hit the tree.
[2249.13s -> 2262.30s]  Find out. That's too far. Way too far. Way too far. I thought I was gonna go through the leaves and
[2262.30s -> 2285.38s]  get all fucked up. All right I- I gotta chip this real lightly here. It's not bad. Fuck you.
[2285.38s -> 2296.71s]  I'm at plus four? Oh shit. Okay I can't be plus five so I actually have to do- okay no fucking
[2296.71s -> 2308.84s]  around. I actually have to do this well. This is perfect for me. It's 143 yards. I gotta go
[2308.84s -> 2326.68s]  like kind of somewhere like here. Like right here. Get on the green. Oh fuck off. All right this is
[2326.68s -> 2356.23s]  uphill. This'll do it. Right in. Yes! I'm good. Nice. Plus three. Level up twice? Ooh. I want to
[2356.23s -> 2370.94s]  get that to at least 200 yards or 180. That was just kind of fun. Three holes in a time limit
[2370.94s -> 2375.26s]  and score well too. You have 10 minutes to finish par three, par four, and a par five.
[2376.06s -> 2387.98s]  It's called speed golf. Speed golf? Well you have to- I have to run around now. All right how does
[2387.98s -> 2409.83s]  this work? Huh? Dash? You can push people out of the way. There's a special dash. This seems kind
[2409.83s -> 2426.42s]  of chaotic. Okay so this is a time limit. Finish three holes at plus three or better in 10 minutes
[2426.42s -> 2464.63s]  or less. So I'm actually playing against other players? Oh fuck I have to run. Okay. All right
[2464.63s -> 2473.91s]  birdie putt. What does it look like? All right so this is um blue means it's going up and the red
[2473.91s -> 2483.86s]  means it's going down. Right? What do we got for wind? Wind is down a lot. Okay I'm just gonna-
[2484.66s -> 2494.70s]  I think it was too hard. Oh we got it. I mean he got it. I did it. I did it. He got it. I got it.
[2495.34s -> 2510.57s]  Okay cool. Oh shit. All right we're gonna go- I'm going this way. Is that stupid? Yeah it is pretty
[2510.57s -> 2527.32s]  stupid. Let's drive it as far as I can. What's the problem? We only have eight and a half minutes.
[2527.88s -> 2541.30s]  That's so funny that you can actually punch people and push people. Go faster?
[2541.94s -> 2550.22s]  Like this is as fast as the character can move. All right 148. We're gonna go- this is curving
[2550.22s -> 2559.45s]  a little. Where's the wind? All right wind's not bad. Let's go. It's gonna be on the green.
[2560.78s -> 2577.11s]  Green? Tell me. Green. Fringe. What's fringe mean? Oh right at the end. Right at the lip.
[2580.38s -> 2588.79s]  All right wind's coming down to the left a little. So it's a hundred foot. We're going
[2588.79s -> 2593.19s]  probably like 30 feet. We're going up. I'm gonna go tighten it up a little bit this way. We're gonna
[2593.19s -> 2614.55s]  go for it. All right. Fringe. Cringe. Oh come on. What the fuck? What happened? Wait what?
[2617.51s -> 2633.67s]  I have no idea what just happened. All right well I got it. Whatever. We're going here and I'm gonna
[2633.67s -> 2654.71s]  go over the sand trap. You can't get a golf cart. I mean this is kind of cool but isn't this the
[2654.71s -> 2668.06s]  exact reason why people play golf video games? Because this is the worst part of golf. Actually
[2668.06s -> 2674.95s]  needing to go to get the ball is like the- is the worst part of the whole sport. All right so the
[2674.95s -> 2679.11s]  wind is going cutting this way a little bit. We're gonna drive it over here. That should give us a
[2679.11s -> 2689.75s]  little bit of leeway I think. It's more fun with people. That makes sense. That makes sense.
[2690.47s -> 2698.36s]  Although is it though? I kind of feel like after you push your friend for the first time
[2699.16s -> 2704.66s]  and then you all laugh eventually you all just start to be like so can we like skip this part?
[2705.30s -> 2710.90s]  It gets to a part where everybody holds down start and it's like oh player four wants to skip
[2710.90s -> 2719.38s]  and everyone else just presses start. It's like yeah yeah yeah. All right so I want to go like
[2719.38s -> 2738.25s]  here. That was way too far. What was it? Oh that was a good approach. All right this is a birdie putt.
[2738.25s -> 2760.44s]  Don't fuck it up. Don't look at wind for putt. Stop acting like you know anything about golf.
[2760.44s -> 2775.42s]  Guys I went to golf camp one day and I left. That's a real story. In fact I would think that
[2775.42s -> 2787.43s]  some of you did the same thing. How many of you guys went to golf camp for like a day or two and
[2787.43s -> 2792.92s]  then we're like eh never mind this isn't for me. I kind of feel like that's happened to more than
[2792.92s -> 2805.48s]  a few of us. It may have been like uh uh maybe I don't know you know when like your kids are
[2805.48s -> 2809.64s]  getting to the age where they're old enough to like hold a baseball bat or like hold a golf club
[2810.20s -> 2817.67s]  and it's like oh maybe hey hey son what do you think about golf um I don't know well we'll get
[2817.67s -> 2822.23s]  you into golf camp and see how it works let's see how it is for you hey hop we'll get you to baseball
[2822.23s -> 2833.62s]  camp and then it's like oh that sounds kind of fun oh it does it sounds fun doesn't it young son
[2833.62s -> 2838.71s]  of course it does that kind of sounds fun I hit the ball with the thing yeah you hit the ball
[2838.71s -> 2859.02s]  the thing oh my boys are gonna grow up and we're gonna be on the back nine together sorry dad yeah
[2859.02s -> 2864.70s]  well yeah yeah yeah it's not I didn't go like to a camp where I like slept over or something for
[2864.70s -> 2872.15s]  like a summer it's not like oh yeah I went to I went to camp and it was like it was like a four
[2872.15s -> 2888.87s]  week golf camp where I stayed over somewhere no can I go over here it sounds like a crappy 90s
[2888.87s -> 2902.15s]  movie let's go qualifying round it'll be golfing with two other players and there's a time limit
[2902.15s -> 2922.47s]  wait am I actually playing with people I'm gonna play all nine holes okay oh shit all right I'm
[2922.47s -> 2933.59s]  ready it finished we're doing nine holes that's so long you know how I would actually enjoy golf
[2936.22s -> 2942.54s]  if an entire game wasn't 18 holes people complain about how long it takes to play a game of baseball
[2944.62s -> 2949.82s]  playing an entire 18 nine holes whatever golf takes like an entire it takes like two days
[2950.62s -> 2971.72s]  oh shit oh how do I punch I'm going for Tony's the weakest come here why am I so slower
[2976.95s -> 2982.94s]  and I like stand in front of it wait this is actually really dangerous uh Yoshi don't swing
[2984.15s -> 2991.38s]  Jesus oh my god that doesn't teach kids anything good that's teaching kids terrible golf etiquette
[2991.38s -> 3019.86s]  what these hearts what are the hearts for where's my ball over here we only have a minute to do this
[3020.42s -> 3039.29s]  oh I'm gonna drain this check this out oh get out of the way you're breathing on me all right
[3039.29s -> 3054.54s]  pink Yoshi fucked up big time cool all right that was fun ready you gotta be the first to drive
[3055.10s -> 3079.38s]  170 yards perfect hold on are they with his animals get away from me oh I needed that
[3088.70s -> 3097.43s]  can I block it holy shit told you awfully okay how far is it it's a 30 feet
[3098.23s -> 3101.59s]  this we're a little bit up the hill here we're gonna curve it I'm gonna smash it this way let's
[3101.59s -> 3113.85s]  go it's in that's in that's in that's in get out of the way what that's all right I did better
[3113.85s -> 3138.41s]  than them that's a bad idea oh I thought I could just clothesline both of them right there
[3144.31s -> 3158.30s]  what are the coins for wait did I just drift what was that okay they're not even close to
[3158.30s -> 3166.87s]  as powerful as I am they're not even close to as powerful as I am oh you guys are going that way
[3166.87s -> 3185.54s]  huh oh actually yeah good idea you need to attack them kill them I can't hurt them still better
[3185.54s -> 3197.22s]  you can exchange the coins does speed even matter I don't know I don't why do I have to
[3197.22s -> 3212.62s]  go so fast I have a minute that's not a ton of time but 130 yards through the tree that's good
[3213.42s -> 3233.34s]  all right I'm gonna probably chip this in we got this 33 yards going okay then they curve in there
[3233.34s -> 3245.42s]  come on all right how's this looking I got a minute and a half to do this all right I want to go like
[3245.42s -> 3252.87s]  here it's a little hard but I think it'll go yep nice you need to grab him by the neck
[3257.29s -> 3263.69s]  be running sprinting behind him grab the caddy of clubs and just pull it as hard as you can so
[3263.69s -> 3274.50s]  they go down imagine they added like a melee attack with just a golf club just left right left
[3274.58s -> 3325.24s]  right left right swinging want the coins come on go oh yeah Gabby J
[3332.68s -> 3348.70s]  did I just knock his ball away wait I think I just did holy shit he almost got it in
[3349.70s -> 3360.58s]  this is going downhill right oh what is Yoshi taking a shit in the hole what was that
[3361.90s -> 3379.29s]  Yoshi was just squatting down in front of the hole come on Toad you can do it it's so depressing
[3384.07s -> 3398.14s]  depressing okay no I can't for the joke I can't I'm like I'm in the lead right now leave me alone
[3412.26s -> 3422.18s]  stop no I wanted that okay do you know how this would actually be fun if it was like
[3422.18s -> 3439.51s]  50 person multiplayer and you could there was collision on all balls I should have
[3439.51s -> 3455.46s]  picked up the driver it's eight that's still kind of a lot yeah I'm drifting behind Toad
[3456.10s -> 3461.48s]  that's why that just happened all right this is gonna be a difficult approach here we go
[3461.48s -> 3467.16s]  we're we're we're on an incline I gotta tilt it a little bit this way and I'm gonna curve it a
[3467.16s -> 3477.27s]  little bit that way that's in the hole that's in the fucking hole oh my god it's not in the
[3477.27s -> 3503.80s]  hole it was almost in the hole oh no Toad Toad just looks like a little kid don't worry Toad
[3503.80s -> 3517.10s]  you're only in the last place I'm in the lead let's get to keep it up mom said you have to
[3517.10s -> 3523.37s]  bring Toad all right where's the wind wind is going nime up I'm not let these idiots
[3523.37s -> 3528.73s]  fucking swing immediately I'm gonna hold them on okay so wind is going that way I'm gonna drive
[3528.73s -> 3542.39s]  it into the wind a little bit like this way it's not too much women it's enough here we go that's
[3542.39s -> 3559.10s]  going in thank you oh fuck I gotta run I'm on the green these guys have a full stroke if I sink this
[3559.10s -> 3568.18s]  putt I win the game this is this is to solidify the game putt this is one of those putts where
[3568.18s -> 3577.61s]  the guy walks around for 40 minutes all right so this is uphill okay it's we're going this way
[3578.49s -> 3590.66s]  it's hard to tell where the hill is okay how strong is that pole going this way I wonder
[3591.38s -> 3610.49s]  this is 100 feet I think this is good let's try it oh more it was more even more to the right
[3621.58s -> 3629.45s]  out they had way more strokes I'm just slowly chipping away Toad wants to play angry birds on
[3629.45s -> 3636.58s]  your iPad make sure it doesn't get the screen all sticky again I will tell you that was one of the
[3636.58s -> 3644.31s]  most that was one of the worst things ever because of being an uncle right I have lots of nieces and
[3644.31s -> 3653.82s]  nephews and anytime it's like oh like can I play with your phone no you're gonna touch it
[3653.82s -> 3658.46s]  and you're gonna like touch it and put your fingers all over it and like you're gonna open
[3658.46s -> 3665.75s]  up like an app I haven't opened in like a year you're going to apple up you're gonna open up
[3665.75s -> 3671.67s]  like apple home you know what I mean I don't I've never opened that I don't want to give it to you
[3672.39s -> 3692.98s]  there's a wind and it's like never the same you have to like really like wash it and rinse it
[3693.62s -> 3723.02s]  bunker I got hit into a bunker still closer than they are oh shit um nice get out of the way
[3723.02s -> 3735.21s]  get out of the way you little puke hates kids hates iphone plays golf but that makes me an old
[3735.21s -> 3751.13s]  person wait hates kids has an iphone and plays golf this one's kind of scary I have a huge
[3751.13s -> 3768.18s]  advantage here because this is just straight drives forward oh you don't like it that I'm
[3768.18s -> 3786.70s]  drifting over there yeah it's mine where's my ball oh there's right there oh I want the driver
[3786.70s -> 3794.58s]  not the three wood what what are you talking about put that away how it eats a three wood

[3810.73s -> 3825.06s]  or not there's a wind all right wind I gotta hit it a little harder sink it sink it oh I got it
[3825.06s -> 3845.29s]  oh be careful toad it's a tricky course it didn't lick your finger and hold it up
[3845.29s -> 3857.82s]  all right now I'm really ahead okay drive drive I don't want to put take the three wood out
[3858.46s -> 3874.12s]  why does he hate toad so much I mean don't blame me why are you blaming me for this blame nintendo
[3875.08s -> 3881.16s]  putting him in last place in every game if he's an ai controlled character I didn't do that
[3881.80s -> 3908.04s]  we're gonna go dry give me the driving wedge there it is bang oh let that go it's all right
[3908.04s -> 3916.58s]  I'm in a good position to drive it over the lake all right I gotta this is gonna slice isn't it
[3916.58s -> 3930.70s]  oh shit it's gonna slice oh fuck that's really slicing where's it going where is it is it on
[3930.70s -> 3944.90s]  green can I go in this what happened is that a stroke oh you dick I'm gonna remember that
[3945.62s -> 3957.35s]  all right we see I'm gonna go they're plus three already these guys how are you plus three already
[3958.07s -> 3984.95s]  it's still like how many holes left dipping it again what's happened I just hit his ball in
[3987.64s -> 4012.90s]  green is wet oh level up level up level up level up I did it great work and just in time
[4017.94s -> 4022.02s]  bonnie greens open tees off tomorrow and after that result you're all eligible to enter
[4024.30s -> 4029.18s]  now it's a two-day tourney the first day is an elimination round if you're still in the next day
[4029.18s -> 4037.48s]  you'll have a chance to earn a chrome badge but only if you finish in the top three oh yeah this
[4037.48s -> 4042.90s]  one's in the bag just hand the trophy over well it may not hit shots like chuck but I'm confident in
[4042.90s -> 4051.67s]  my strategy old words but you're both looking past me as if I'm not even here I suppose I'm a
[4051.67s -> 4065.86s]  ghost yeah this is only four players four player tournament I'm gonna laugh if I'm more powerful
[4065.86s -> 4081.64s]  than um charging chuck whatever his name is if this won a chance you might be in for a surprise
[4081.64s -> 4086.28s]  tomorrow and besides who says you're the favorites I heard some top players might be making an
[4086.28s -> 4100.92s]  appearance like uh potentially super mario super mario could be there okay uh hammer brother I
[4100.92s -> 4108.70s]  have a question why are you allowing smurfs mario and luigi being allowed in this tournament is
[4108.70s -> 4120.55s]  not fair okay let's go we do things differently here the higher your rank the fewer clubs you
[4120.55s -> 4126.94s]  can carry trust me it works out I only need one club but that sounds tough for folks who don't
[4126.94s -> 4157.02s]  crush the driver like I do we you and me are gonna get along everybody go to bed a lot of
[4157.02s -> 4162.50s]  townspeople to talk to but I'm not going to talk to any of them you know that jump that I had in
[4162.50s -> 4180.06s]  the game they took it from me no no no no I don't want to leave me alone this is a cute little town
[4180.70s -> 4199.02s]  it's golf camp there's sprint mario slaughters these people this is like isn't this kind of
[4199.02s -> 4209.53s]  weird like oh we're at the fun golf camp golf town with all the koopas and goombas and like mario
[4209.53s -> 4224.94s]  kills these people on a regular basis all the time mario's just an actor they all just actors
[4226.81s -> 4240.26s]  movies and tv shows aren't real what he's playing he's an actor he's playing golf with other actors
[4240.82s -> 4252.02s]  they're actors in the story are they actually actors wait what how have I not known this
[4252.66s -> 4263.69s]  the world of super mario is actors pretending to play fight each other they do that in mario 3
[4266.63s -> 4271.58s]  but I mean that's mario 3 was one game is that how it's supposed to be the whole
[4271.58s -> 4291.93s]  entire franchise that's why there are curtains in the beginning of three
[4292.73s -> 4317.62s]  platforms in three are props I mean I understand that one game can be but is it like mario odyssey
[4317.62s -> 4328.30s]  for instance is all just supposed to be like a movie like they're actors it's just in one game
[4328.30s -> 4349.75s]  yeah it's like the truman show mario doesn't know that would be really weird what a shot from
[4349.75s -> 4353.51s]  koopa troopa I think we're in for some great scores today with the way the course is playing
[4353.51s -> 4362.42s]  wait a minute the key to following mario around with the camera makes a hell of a lot more sense
[4362.42s -> 4380.26s]  now he's just filming him for the fucking tv show what it's kind of ruining everything
[4384.79s -> 4406.62s]  all right here we go hole one drive the ball 200 yards every time how did you get that special
[4406.62s -> 4429.72s]  move oh yeah how is toad announcing and playing all right 166 this is uphill we're gonna have to
[4429.72s -> 4446.60s]  go wind is a little bit rough this way here we go it's on the green now you gotta hit it one more
[4446.60s -> 4461.43s]  time I don't this is a different toad you asshole are okay everybody shut up for a second because
[4461.43s -> 4469.37s]  this is gonna be hard this one goes downhill then uphill and it looks like it's pulling this way
[4470.89s -> 4483.18s]  tad so I gotta hit it actually pretty hard we're gonna hit it hard that's in that's in that's in
[4483.18s -> 4497.51s]  that's in that's in that's in that's in that's in oh fuck it oh come on are you serious that
[4497.51s -> 4507.51s]  would have been awesome and I was curbed in you address the scandal well because I said that I
[4507.51s -> 4511.35s]  thought toad was playing uh look I wasn't paying attention I just see him with a headset on
[4512.31s -> 4539.51s]  holy shit wait a minute that might go in what what happened oh no no okay okay it rolled it
[4539.51s -> 4550.18s]  rolled all right I gotta drain this I actually have to sink this slightly there's a little bit
[4550.18s -> 4557.67s]  of give here not very much but there is 15 feet away there's a little bit of give not that much
[4562.74s -> 4574.36s]  oh there's more there was more give that was blue it wasn't blue though it's all right I'm
[4574.36s -> 4582.47s]  still in third place but the top of that toad had like a blue hat on and the toad announcing had a
[4582.47s -> 4589.91s]  blue hat on okay well not in the ass of he's gonna suit on but you know but he had a fucking
[4589.91s -> 4612.02s]  blue hat on I swear to god what is that bullshit he's doing working two jobs to support his one
[4612.02s -> 4641.96s]  million kids why are you implying that toads kind of just dump eggs out somewhere don't be
[4641.96s -> 4646.12s]  mad at me because I thought that was the same toad be mad at the guy that said toads lay a million
[4646.12s -> 4651.16s]  eggs all right that's I'm the guy you're coming after that's me you're coming after why why are
[4651.16s -> 4670.31s]  you coming after me all right 109 you said that though what I didn't say I was talking about what
[4670.31s -> 4691.03s]  that guy said a million kids it's from it's spores well how do you get to a million kids
[4691.03s -> 4696.39s]  if you're not laying like fucking 10,000 eggs every spring or whatever the fuck happens in
[4696.39s -> 4703.75s]  like the world like the animal kingdom I'm not saying toads an animal I'm just saying I'm just
[4703.75s -> 4710.30s]  saying like you how do you have a million kids he needs to support his million kids that's like
[4710.30s -> 4727.83s]  you're dropping 50,000 eggs every spring mushrooms are fungi ready how how fast does fungi spread a
[4727.83s -> 4766.74s]  year you don't understand toad fucks I wasn't looking I wasn't looking I heard a golf swing
[4766.74s -> 4779.27s]  and then I heard my character go oh all right where's the wind this way you guys are fucking
[4779.27s -> 4791.38s]  crazy everyone's calling me crazy when I'm simply reacting to the person that said that toad has a
[4791.38s -> 4798.74s]  million kids and I'm asking I was just simply asking how that would be possible even if he
[4798.74s -> 4807.69s]  was a mushroom all right this is heavy heavy heavy I gotta go this way hard is this too much
[4808.41s -> 4833.82s]  this is very heavy downhill right fuck you that was the one two I'm sorry I'm in second
[4840.82s -> 4846.73s]  toad spreads his spores in a forest and that's where the babies come from okay so he lays eggs
[4846.73s -> 4876.86s]  in the forest I got it okay got it like really my stomach hurts the amount of people right now that
[4876.86s -> 4881.74s]  are freaking out about me talking about toad laying eggs is like it's killing me right now
[4885.11s -> 4903.59s]  all right way too far imagine fighting with somebody over them saying that toad lays eggs
[4906.55s -> 4917.13s]  oh this whole conversation is fucking hilarious to me you I know I am I know it's fucking funny
[4917.69s -> 4944.74s]  this is gonna curve there it is oh get in come on I'm just imagining two people
[4945.70s -> 4948.95s]  sitting on a couch passing a blunt back and forth
[4950.70s -> 4957.83s]  oh but I don't know I don't understand man how is it possible he has to lay eggs no I know he it's
[4957.83s -> 4964.95s]  spores it he goes to the forest and squats down and spores come out of his ass I don't know man
[4964.95s -> 4970.07s]  I don't know how how much spore juice does he have in his in his glands that's too much I think it's
[4970.07s -> 4988.10s]  eggs you're saying this is not the idiocy of the conversation we're having all right 166
[4990.20s -> 4993.88s]  gonna go right here that's a good on right there actually gonna be good
[4994.60s -> 5012.17s]  while eating taco bell at 2 a.m. all right this is a good opportunity to get first place
[5012.17s -> 5020.15s]  I have to get this putt though all right what we got 50 foot putt
[5021.29s -> 5035.18s]  lots of pull this way I'm going here I think it's even more than that I think it's right here drain
[5035.18s -> 5054.95s]  it drain it oh it's close minus one all right I have to do well here I can't let charge and chuck
[5054.95s -> 5074.12s]  win a short game moron that was actually pretty good that's elder to your special
[5075.08s -> 5087.13s]  I think my specials just run I don't have one yet that's hope is that chuck fucks it up yeah how
[5087.13s -> 5101.74s]  come um what I'm not with chuck right now I'm not on his uh squad whatever this is this is going
[5101.74s -> 5112.06s]  right to the green what's the wind like we're gonna cut it this way a little bit and go I think that's
[5112.06s -> 5124.15s]  good that looks real good actually that's gonna be close how close though enough to
[5124.15s -> 5138.33s]  sink this oh yeah this is doable so I always have so much trouble in these golf games on
[5138.33s -> 5148.04s]  how much this actually means that's steep I think right here I think right here wind is pushing it
[5148.04s -> 5163.37s]  this way though how much does the wind really affect putt when it's downhill like this wind
[5163.37s -> 5171.38s]  does affect putt it's because it's gonna pull me this way then levels out a little I'm thinking
[5171.38s -> 5186.58s]  right here I'm going for it there it is all right we're in first place I had for first with chuck
[5192.06s -> 5199.88s]  not bad watch out for that tree I don't want to hit that tree
[5200.52s -> 5220.82s]  you're gonna play call of duty four no no I'm not playing call of duty four
[5227.91s -> 5237.74s]  get out of the way all right this is where's the wind it's gonna I gotta oh I have to overshoot
[5237.74s -> 5264.06s]  this a little bit because the wind I'm gonna be on the green good spot right yeah all right this
[5264.06s -> 5272.52s]  is this is flat so I should nice putt all right this is literally just flat there's nothing here
[5272.52s -> 5286.22s]  it's literally just straight 15 feet right to the hole this is it got it there's no way that he got
[5286.22s -> 5295.14s]  a birdie on that hole as well no he didn't okay good first place all right I just I have to get
[5295.14s -> 5313.90s]  a par here this is it I can't fuck around I actually have to try hard here the time doesn't
[5313.90s -> 5329.37s]  matter just click the coins Jeremy doesn't get golf Jeremy's in first place speaking in third
[5329.37s -> 5344.97s]  person Jeremy you're not going to get the ice cream later why do you get to decide when I get
[5344.97s -> 5350.54s]  to eat ice cream or not all right we're going for something hard here here we go this is gonna be
[5350.54s -> 5365.02s]  this is this is ballsy this is ballsy oh don't go in the water all right it's good it's good it's
[5365.02s -> 5379.59s]  good it's good it's good it's good I bet you like pistachio ice cream yeah I do actually it's
[5379.59s -> 5386.82s]  phenomenal all right all right all right we're gonna go a little bit overshoot it gonna curve
[5386.82s -> 5398.58s]  a little bit right here get it on the green that was solid could have been better this is flat
[5400.87s -> 5409.46s]  all right this is it I will win the tournament okay so this is very gently downhill or uphill
[5412.49s -> 5420.47s]  wind is going this way a little bit I'm thinking right here but look it's the hill goes to the
[5420.47s -> 5429.50s]  right all right wait this might not work out the way I want shit it wasn't even that strong
[5429.50s -> 5451.86s]  whatever I still win yep I win I got first place I'm good how many levels you got I gotta
[5451.86s -> 5461.58s]  get at least four or five levels in the first place all right hold on stamina speed control
[5461.58s -> 5473.54s]  spin I mean I'm thinking this right I honestly don't give a shit how fast I can run who cares
[5483.66s -> 5490.55s]  control and power that means I can always my drives will always be right on the mark
[5490.55s -> 5497.74s]  and then later on I can worry about how fast I'm running it doesn't really matter
[5507.42s -> 5510.46s]  by the way why is it weird to like pistachio ice cream what's why is it so weird
[5511.18s -> 5525.13s]  I thought that was pretty popular disgusting it is not I have a bad take for you pistachio ice
[5525.13s -> 5538.55s]  cream is delicious pistachios are gross that's my bad take of the evening for you yeah I don't like
[5538.55s -> 5553.43s]  pistachios but I like pistachio ice cream I think it's the added sugar that makes that pistachio
[5553.43s -> 5567.72s]  flavor become very very good for me pistachio is the most amazing thing ever somebody told me
[5567.72s -> 5574.46s]  something about pistachios one time and it freaked me out and I forget what it was and it would turn
[5574.46s -> 5578.94s]  me off from eating them forever and I what was it there's something weird about pistachios right
[5578.94s -> 5591.27s]  isn't there something weird is it bugs I don't it's something about like them being like actually
[5591.27s -> 5607.16s]  kind of gross you mean figs oh it's something weird something about like I'm gonna let me look
[5607.16s -> 5611.96s]  this up before I like give you a total complete misinformation campaign here like let me get this
[5611.96s -> 5639.50s]  right what is it is it was it isn't a conspiracy I don't think so why are pistachios like bad
[5639.50s -> 5644.86s]  right like I'm just I don't I don't remember it was something weird that I was like no I don't
[5644.86s -> 5651.70s]  want to eat those and it was something it was something like odd and I looked at it was like
[5651.70s -> 5665.88s]  that's kind of weird not figs no figs is the wasp shit I know that was a clickbait was it
[5665.88s -> 5672.52s]  a fake news clickbait title no no no no it was I maybe it was like a I want to say I don't want
[5672.52s -> 5691.26s]  to say what I thought it was let me see oh I guess they were recalled pistachios at some point
[5695.05s -> 5705.11s]  is that what this is this is like from a few years ago it caused farts and bloating
[5709.21s -> 5716.46s]  that's not what this says you probably heard no I don't know what that is yeah
[5716.78s -> 5720.78s]  there was like something weird like four or five years ago with like salmon whatever it is
[5728.22s -> 5735.64s]  cashews are the ones that the fruit is poisonous no it wasn't cashews it was start the final round
[5735.64s -> 5741.72s]  oh fuck I gotta pay attention ashes are covered in a strong maybe that is what it was
[5742.44s -> 5753.34s]  maybe is that what it is does somebody get it aflatoxins is that what it was what it was
[5758.95s -> 5764.47s]  aflatoxin a chemical in which can cause cancerous mold has been found in some mistreated pistachios
[5764.47s -> 5769.59s]  and alleged breakouts of diseases that's all right so I wasn't crazy is that a legit article
[5769.59s -> 5801.48s]  though pistachios contained toad spores source dude I told you me you trust me right it gives
[5801.48s -> 5815.11s]  a yee-haw to prove your American citizenship what I don't think I could even do a good yee-haw
[5815.11s -> 5822.47s]  it would probably be embarrassing you would think I would not pass your test that you have here
[5823.11s -> 5847.24s]  all right this is the finals I don't know like eat like yee-haw like that but I feel like to do
[5847.24s -> 5862.42s]  that you have to like lean back put your fist up and go like I get in this sand oh shit I did
[5862.42s -> 5870.95s]  get in the sand this is bad all right I gotta pay attention what if I just drive it out of here can
[5870.95s -> 5895.08s]  I do it no that's too that's too that's too risky too risky stay on the fairway please okay okay
[5895.08s -> 5902.50s]  where's the wind going put it on the green right here it's safe it should get there
[5906.76s -> 5916.25s]  oh my god it went in it went oh it didn't go in that was close too damn all right that was
[5916.25s -> 5936.01s]  really close what a recovery that was the only first place but no I pistachio flavor I think
[5936.01s -> 5955.26s]  it's okay they kind of work go I like pistachio ice cream you know I'm kind of a weirdo I think
[5955.26s -> 5966.57s]  I like it because it's green have you handed me vanilla ice cream and you handed me vanilla
[5966.57s -> 5973.10s]  ice cream that was tinted a sky blue or like robin's egg blue I would like it more I would
[5973.10s -> 5985.56s]  go oh wow this is awesome my imagination fills in the blanks all right where's the wind is going
[5985.56s -> 5998.25s]  a little bit this way we gotta go we're in 66 a little bit pull it up a little robin's egg blue
[5998.33s -> 6009.32s]  oh it's on you like spinach I need to know I spinach is actually my favorite green vegetable
[6011.48s -> 6029.45s]  yes I do very much so okay I got a minute and a half I'm fine so this has got a I think that's
[6029.45s -> 6042.98s]  good till a little bit more I said so I don't know how to do it spinach is based spinach is the best
[6042.98s -> 6056.12s]  green vegetable you can do tons of stuff with it you can saute it you can like mix it up it turns
[6056.12s -> 6060.92s]  into a different thing you can eat spinach raw and if you cook it it turns into this weird like
[6060.92s -> 6066.76s]  kind of wilty soft delicious kind of juicy thing or you can eat it like salad like normal
[6067.56s -> 6077.13s]  it's very versatile so I know I don't I like spinach more than kale the scale kale is kind
[6077.13s -> 6083.72s]  of weird it's got a weird texture you have to chew through it more it's a little stringy spinach
[6083.72s -> 6098.97s]  is way better I mean I think kale is probably better for you pound for pound nutrient density
[6098.97s -> 6108.78s]  whatever but is that really that big of a deal he just turned it up I understand there's like
[6108.78s -> 6114.57s]  tackling and pushing in this game but that was like a red card you know like where's the referee
[6115.21s -> 6127.61s]  it was good in smoothies yeah kale is good when it's used I can't go through that tree yeah I can
[6127.61s -> 6152.47s]  get through the tree yes yes it's actually up there it's actually all the way up there
[6153.11s -> 6166.74s]  I'm on top of this hill too this actually is not a bad place to be
[6167.54s -> 6190.28s]  this is gonna curve curved in that's pretty good all right I saved some time there I think
[6191.16s -> 6204.78s]  what's the skybox for a second I see tearing I think I just go I it's not gonna be enough to
[6204.78s -> 6212.98s]  affect the movement all the way down there's a little bit of pull this way I think this is
[6212.98s -> 6225.02s]  gonna be fine it's not gonna hit her hard enough exactly what I was thinking was gonna happen
[6225.02s -> 6228.54s]  that's exactly what I that's why I didn't want to do that hard I didn't want to go that far
[6229.18s -> 6238.55s]  I just have to get pars that's all that matters I'm two strokes ahead of Chuck
[6239.11s -> 6268.14s]  this way why not getting that this game sucks but you said sucks in all capitals
[6268.78s -> 6279.64s]  remember this game sucks that was you were very upset about this I think it's fun
[6285.69s -> 6290.73s]  what's your problem with it okay how about you tell me what you think about how bad that you
[6290.73s -> 6313.62s]  don't like it and I'll tell you how bad I think it is okay it's not actually just messing around
[6313.62s -> 6319.35s]  the side it's really not a bad game it's really fun I could see how you could just sit here and
[6319.35s -> 6329.10s]  chill and play golf I get it it's fun this is the awful game to watch well golf is awful to watch
[6329.10s -> 6337.62s]  in general and what is this hill it's going right and left at the same time what am I supposed to
[6337.62s -> 6366.71s]  do about this um I don't know nothing all right nice yeah way ahead ready golf really is one of
[6366.71s -> 6374.12s]  those weird games at least in a video game sense I actually really don't mind playing golf in a
[6374.12s -> 6389.08s]  video game but I really despise it playing it in real life it's truly do but it's kind of the
[6389.08s -> 6395.59s]  opposite for baseball for me I would rather play a game of baseball in real life than play a video
[6395.59s -> 6400.55s]  game of it I don't know about just getting the bat and getting up there and swinging
[6402.23s -> 6429.74s]  on the reverse that's good get it well get out of the way it's not gonna make it I ran away with
[6429.74s -> 6435.74s]  it though there's no way he comes back I would have to be a moron and get I'd have to do it
[6435.74s -> 6475.14s]  intentionally bad as a joke somebody said Omega Lul he has negative points I got a p too Mario
[6475.14s -> 6495.58s]  sluggers that was actually really good before I think this is a crazy idea this I want to get on
[6495.58s -> 6508.07s]  green you to play Mario strikers I probably will play Mario strikers I was a huge fan of the uh
[6508.07s -> 6539.14s]  one for the Wii let's chip this shit in play this all day no Elden Ring please that's probably not
[6539.14s -> 6546.54s]  gonna happen I'm obsessed with Elden Ring right now somewhere at the halfway point I'm gonna take
[6546.54s -> 6552.47s]  a little bit I'm gonna take like 15-20 minutes this could be a hole in one if I can get it
[6552.47s -> 6581.21s]  it's gonna be close that's actually gonna be close you do a knitting scream I don't think
[6581.21s -> 6599.13s]  that would be enjoyable I think you would all hate that ax out speed and you can tackle them
[6599.13s -> 6611.85s]  all right only two holes left and I completed my first tournament are there many games I want to
[6611.85s -> 6633.58s]  play mini games I'm so far ahead I can just literally relax just get the coins and the hearts
[6633.58s -> 6638.95s]  and stuff what's what's wrong with the music I don't understand people don't like the music
[6639.83s -> 6647.10s]  what's the problem with the music everyone's like music turn it off please
[6648.74s -> 6683.50s]  okay it's because it's on a five second loop it kind of is I would have had that
[6699.75s -> 6705.86s]  it is the same song I haven't paid any attention oh my god Yoshi you're plus 10
[6713.19s -> 6717.99s]  is Yoshi doing the thing at mini golf where you're infuriated and you're not having a good time
[6719.29s -> 6723.13s]  so you just drag the ball three or four times when you get it close enough and you don't care
[6727.29s -> 6732.01s]  you mess up and you just drag drag drag in and it counts as like four strokes
[6732.98s -> 6752.95s]  is that what you're doing right now Yoshi just drive it that's where my skills are
[6752.95s -> 6763.75s]  uh
[6763.75s -> 6781.21s]  it actually has been this for an hour how do I go in the sand what I'm so far ahead who
[6781.21s -> 6814.68s]  fucking cares just drive it there it is oh shit I don't want to hit anybody with this
[6818.15s -> 6825.80s]  wait do I have to go get it I don't have to go get it right it's out of bounds it's out of bounds
[6825.80s -> 6857.98s]  I I can't get that okay close I win plus 12 I got my first medal the star cup
[6859.35s -> 6867.48s]  there's not two other pedestals only one for first place thousand coins and probably leveled up like
[6867.48s -> 6884.52s]  five times oh yeah your special dash improved all right so control is fine spin I don't really care
[6884.52s -> 6908.50s]  about that I'll do stamina head to ridge rock lake this dude's doing an endurance build
[6909.30s -> 6938.58s]  actually I gotta pee real bad but not yet rise and shine champ oh all right all right please
[6938.58s -> 6943.83s]  take a pee break all right I'll take we'll take it I've been playing for two hours I feel like
[6944.76s -> 6951.77s]  am I actually am I having fun because that's kind of odd all right I did not expect to be playing
[6951.77s -> 7243.54s]  for two hours all right I'll be right back I'm gonna pee give me two seconds yeah what's that
[7243.54s -> 7251.58s]  I mean it's all right I'm just I'll be done in like a little bit later tonight I mean it's okay it's
[7251.58s -> 7258.57s]  it's like it's probably like a four it's in though yeah if I just keep pretending to like it
[7259.77s -> 7268.38s]  fans will you know so yeah so to keep pretending to like it even though I can fucking hate it
[7269.02s -> 7277.69s]  that's just pretty yeah I see look oh my god I just got caught oh my god I got caught
[7280.81s -> 7307.16s]  no no no no no all right let's go this is kind of cool there's a map I love the hot mic joke it's
[7307.16s -> 7321.62s]  it's the worst fucking joke it really is it's not it's not it's the worst one oh new area
[7322.34s -> 7338.47s]  is that putting practice congrats on the chrome badge x is bronze you check to see if your mic
[7338.47s -> 7344.39s]  is off I mean I have a little thing where I turn it off and on like a little button I press
[7345.19s -> 7347.99s]  sometimes I don't press it sometimes I'm just like what oh I don't really care
[7355.66s -> 7369.05s]  big storm won't be any tournaments for a while what we can't hear anything yeah you can have
[7369.05s -> 7377.59s]  you ever heard of cross-country golf xc golf for short believe it or not xc golf goes way back it's
[7377.59s -> 7383.48s]  a form of the game that many of the top players have mastered some of the really high level
[7383.48s -> 7389.50s]  players can still play our course even in this state it's remarkable to see them in action of
[7389.50s -> 7396.92s]  course they can use special shots so it's not exactly fair maybe you saw mario in that televised
[7396.92s -> 7402.17s]  I was I thought he's gonna say commercial you've already seen a special shot some of them are so
[7402.17s -> 7405.37s]  powerful that they can affect other players and blast their golf balls out of the way
[7409.11s -> 7423.32s]  okay interesting so everybody has a special move I get it so should I just play the regular game
[7423.32s -> 7438.04s]  mode and just pick a character and just go play that sounds like something interesting
[7443.51s -> 7448.70s]  pick seven clubs there's a lot of elevation change the nine iron look I don't know okay
[7449.50s -> 7466.49s]  let me tell you what I need I need the driver I need six iron pitching wedge this is changing
[7466.49s -> 7481.02s]  golf attire okay yeah I don't even want that maybe I'll take it I'll take a six iron I'll take the
[7481.02s -> 7492.06s]  six hybrid sounds good successfully downloaded data for pick cross he really just fucking expose
[7492.06s -> 7510.82s]  me like that all right let's try it no I don't want to change gear you find yourself in a really
[7510.82s -> 7517.66s]  tricky spot and we all do from time to time you're not totally out of luck all right I'll be fine
[7517.66s -> 7530.62s]  play a practice round of xc golf verifying badge confirmed registration for xc golf practice round
[7530.62s -> 7537.82s]  complete complete three holes and 30 strokes or fewer to advance okay may encounter tornadoes on
[7537.82s -> 7547.88s]  the course this is normal this they may be used to edit okay be careful there are hazards sure
[7549.91s -> 7557.22s]  drops from flat lies will fly straight yeah lots of uphill will curve downhill will curve
[7557.22s -> 7563.56s]  yeah yeah yeah the moral yeah yeah yeah all right I'm not gonna play pick cross right now I'm okay
[7563.56s -> 7577.93s]  stop tornadoes on the course will blow both golfers and golf balls into the sky okay
[7578.57s -> 7597.82s]  did I do that wait there are two different holes so you have to okay all right I got an idea
[7598.92s -> 7617.14s]  is this stupid will this go into that wind and go up that didn't do anything I thought it was
[7617.14s -> 7626.97s]  gonna go in the tornado and go up I guess not oh well okay never mind all right I gotta be
[7626.97s -> 7639.90s]  careful huge wind pushing this way so I'm gonna sit right here big curve as well I'll go too far
[7644.25s -> 7649.30s]  pretty good said watch out for them don't go directly into them but I thought it was
[7649.30s -> 7658.15s]  gonna make the ball bounce up that's a that's steep I think that's the one right there
[7661.77s -> 7667.13s]  ah again I keep messing that up it's the worst dream it's not pick cross I'm not playing pick
[7667.13s -> 7677.94s]  cross stop asking for it or I'm gonna be very upset with you so now we go again oh okay this is
[7677.94s -> 7692.34s]  kind of I this is actually cool I do genuinely like this it's gonna hit the wall oh it does work
[7692.34s -> 7714.14s]  so why didn't it work last time I said this is downhill a little bit big wind I'm not playing
[7714.14s -> 7726.62s]  pick I'm not playing pick Ross no no I'll play pick Ross later this is gonna be like a 10 hour
[7726.62s -> 7741.94s]  stream will you guys just just buckle up oh no I did this completely wrong there's the wind
[7741.94s -> 7756.82s]  okay tornado this way I should go into that tornado and go up please make it I'm fine
[7759.24s -> 7767.08s]  I'm not gonna play pick Ross for like four hours oh I gotta go across the whole fucking game again
[7767.08s -> 7788.17s]  god damn it I'll play a few rounds of pick Ross no later than at least 45 minutes from right now
[7788.73s -> 7800.22s]  okay will that actually go up will that travel up in the tornado I hope so as if I'm doing it
[7800.78s -> 7815.74s]  watch out we were kidding don't that's what I'm saying I know you guys are such fucking
[7815.74s -> 7843.14s]  jokers not even gonna get on the green what an idiot 17 strokes left oh no nice
[7844.18s -> 7850.28s]  I knew this was gonna happen I knew it was gonna happen
[7857.32s -> 7868.55s]  44 minutes until pick Ross maybe all right let's do it for real I was tracking my every move
[7869.11s -> 7879.67s]  let's do it let's register for a standard xc golf tournament that was actually pretty cool
[7880.57s -> 7901.93s]  you can approach that a bunch of different ways let's go use your coins how do I use my coins
[7905.27s -> 7917.56s]  how to play no who sells shit here somebody sells something who is the shop keeper over here
[7919.94s -> 7938.60s]  okay welcome anything you want to buy bullet bill for a hybrid where's the where is it
[7956.02s -> 7972.02s]  is this it let me just see if this is it no where is this commercial for this fucking driver
[7973.38s -> 7999.51s]  I don't know boomerang oh these are good I want those okay so then rana plant makes it easier
[7999.51s -> 8011.37s]  to control shots out of deep ruffin mud I kind of want the bullet bill hybrid I mean why wouldn't
[8011.37s -> 8031.98s]  I use that elevation finder yeah okay what do you sell food all right let me put those uh let me
[8031.98s -> 8059.32s]  put that stuff on okay all right I think we're good I thought there were no golf cards you were
[8059.32s -> 8063.96s]  clear for three holes of standard xc golf progress in any order complete the required
[8063.96s -> 8076.15s]  holes in 30 strokes mm-hmm wait there's a shot clock now I know how a spin shot works
[8085.37s -> 8095.82s]  can you die in this I'm no you can't you have two minutes to hit and reach your ball before
[8095.82s -> 8104.90s]  you be assessed a stroke penalty buddy okay that doesn't seem that big of a deal at least not yet
[8105.80s -> 8126.50s]  not initially this game is a unity asset swap I think it's a little better I that's better than
[8126.50s -> 8138.81s]  that what do the coins do I just purchased a few things you can buy uh upgrades and that the guy
[8138.81s -> 8162.39s]  that guy's gonna hit me isn't he what all right watch it we got high wind oh I thought that was
[8162.39s -> 8175.78s]  the pitching wedge I didn't think I I didn't think that was a putter I thought I had the pitching
[8175.78s -> 8185.02s]  wedge on why do I sound like that I've been going straight on I'm just gonna hit it as hard as I can
[8191.74s -> 8206.15s]  shit sorry that'll go in how do I get up there what is it doing what what are you talking about
[8212.54s -> 8225.21s]  didn't go in the uh didn't go in the thing here um how am I supposed to handle this
[8243.59s -> 8258.68s]  all right I made it up there where is it all right I made it yep now I use it good
[8262.12s -> 8294.02s]  now this is downhill heavy winds I'm so bad at putting it's fine I have 19 strokes left
[8298.82s -> 8323.83s]  oh my god I went the wrong way again ah now I understand where the stamina comes from
[8323.83s -> 8337.03s]  I didn't think it was gonna be this important is this game open world it is not this is just kind
[8337.03s -> 8345.67s]  of a cool game mode where you have to sink in three different holes in a certain amount of strokes
[8345.75s -> 8350.07s]  which I'll give him credit it's time to give uh the super nintendo developer some credit
[8351.45s -> 8357.77s]  that's cool that's a cool spin on golf it just increased the letter grid but here's the problem
[8358.33s -> 8371.61s]  how do I all right I'm gonna go nine can I do nine iron six iron might do it nine iron might
[8371.61s -> 8408.70s]  just barely get over the hill I'm going for it fuck I gotta get it up there uh shit um okay
[8412.38s -> 8417.82s]  wait it did go up wait what what happened am I I'm I've lost my mind I don't know what's going on
[8418.54s -> 8445.83s]  is it bad wait how hard did I just hit that it's right here we're good I did this completely
[8445.83s -> 8460.02s]  wrong but whatever whoa I can break those this case pretty good this is gonna this is gonna
[8460.02s -> 8475.66s]  slice like crazy so I'm gonna hit it this way why was that not even a slice the game just told me
[8475.66s -> 8491.02s]  oh my god dude you're fucked think it in you should please do the let's freaking go voice
[8493.62s -> 8506.82s]  nice maybe I will in a minute that was fun I like this I'm not moving yet please do it
[8512.47s -> 8519.03s]  that was solid seems like you're figuring out xc golf I think you'd do well in a competition
[8519.03s -> 8522.79s]  making good progress on course repairs so we should be ready to host some kind of a competition soon
[8523.51s -> 8536.20s]  play a standard round of xc golf all right let's do it the next stream should be you going golfing
[8536.20s -> 8542.86s]  the next big stream I would just slice the ball we do a big thing where I elaborately oh I'm
[8542.86s -> 8547.58s]  gonna do nine holes of golf I get up there I tee up and I would slice the ball so bad that we I'd
[8547.58s -> 8563.22s]  lose the ball and get frustrated and probably stop streaming off infuriates me I need to do
[8563.22s -> 8569.00s]  six holes in 35 strokes all right I gotta be careful this actually is where the game begins
[8576.41s -> 8583.70s]  ready all right there are six go we gotta go this way first go that was like in my ear that was
[8583.70s -> 8597.88s]  weird all right we're gonna go this way this is gonna make it well this is gonna bounce right off
[8597.88s -> 8613.53s]  the edge isn't it might not it's gonna bounce right off it why would I don't be more concerned
[8613.53s -> 8629.48s]  about the tree that's there and not the rock now I have to sand wedge it up there can I can I sand
[8629.48s -> 8656.47s]  wedge it up please come on sand wedge yes all right how do I get up there okay we're good
[8656.47s -> 8667.59s]  it's up on another ledge all right another sandwich I'm not far enough
[8671.42s -> 8682.55s]  wait where was that gonna end up okay so if I do six iron at about 50% I'm gonna say 50% speed
[8683.27s -> 8689.69s]  it's gonna slice a little I'm gonna do nine iron we're doing nine iron straight on
[8697.64s -> 8710.06s]  yep yep all right nice were you thinking of the hammer driver infomercial I don't know it's like
[8710.06s -> 8718.79s]  from like 1998 or something I don't know what it is but that's you can't that's just illegal
[8721.02s -> 8730.06s]  okay where is this thing over here all right we're almost there I'm gonna drive it here it's
[8730.06s -> 8745.22s]  gonna curve a little this next part shouldn't be too bad god damn it this one sucks to get to I
[8745.22s -> 8765.98s]  have 30 strokes left I'm okay okay right before the putt why is he talking like he's fighting an
[8765.98s -> 8778.65s]  Elden Ring boss because that's the only thing I've done for two straight weeks get the putter
[8778.65s -> 8793.74s]  out can't tell I had to hit it way harder because it was in the fucking rough whatever
[8794.30s -> 8806.09s]  all right 28 strokes we need five more holes they're all over there um I'm gonna say we're
[8806.09s -> 8820.10s]  gonna go the one all the way to the right look how far apart these are these things are so far away
[8820.74s -> 8854.70s]  what all right move straight again oh my god is this gonna can I actually make that I wonder
[8858.68s -> 8877.48s]  oh that's what those fucking idiots get over here all right change plan I gotta go this one
[8877.48s -> 8892.25s]  what the heck is this dude I'm playing Mario Golf this is just a game my twitch analytics
[8897.03s -> 8912.65s]  so I'm so my whole directory is not Elden Ring there's got to be at least three hours of Mario
[8912.65s -> 8917.29s]  Golf so it will fit into the algorithm of like other games that I've played in the last month
[8917.93s -> 8935.99s]  that's good and oh yeah and Picross will be there too that's right
[8936.79s -> 8952.46s]  you got a good point okay this is still very possible because I need I have to go this way
[8952.46s -> 8955.50s]  now we're gonna go this way we're gonna go over to the right and then I'm gonna come down into
[8955.50s -> 8961.10s]  the middle again should be all right what's the wind like all right wind is blowing a lot this way
[8961.98s -> 8984.02s]  I'm gonna go a little bit short right there watch out for the tree oh 30 more minutes to meet the
[8984.02s -> 8991.53s]  Mario Golf quota I mean it's not this isn't a bounty or anything
[9004.22s -> 9020.66s]  wait did I do that did I fuck up the tree oh this is gonna slice like crazy okay 38 yards
[9030.07s -> 9039.98s]  oh there was a lot of wind too though don't mess this up it's very very very steep and I have to
[9039.98s -> 9052.92s]  hit it not that hard right there right here perfect god fucking damn it I'll never get it
[9060.89s -> 9065.13s]  what the fuck what I was trying to skip through where is it going
[9068.71s -> 9079.10s]  well that's not good I was trying to skip the dialogue sequence this is really uphill though
[9079.66s -> 9124.38s]  will this make it oh I did I got it okay same thing here uh it's not gonna work oh this is bad
[9125.02s -> 9137.72s]  I have to tornado it but I can't I have 16 strokes left I'm not gonna be able to do this
[9138.36s -> 9165.27s]  I need to how am I gonna do this a hundred feet I gotta go like that didn't do anything
[9172.94s -> 9181.72s]  okay all right all right that's it I got it now it's over this is ruined how are you supposed
[9181.72s -> 9189.46s]  to reliably get up there yeah this is this is ruined I have to it's gotta go like over here
[9194.10s -> 9211.96s]  wait all right that's good that's not what I wanted to do I mean I'm screwed either way honestly so
[9212.68s -> 9217.94s]  does it really matter let's keep zooming out so far like what are you doing
[9219.38s -> 9236.28s]  what's with this shit view what is with this terrible fucking camera will this get picked
[9236.28s -> 9244.07s]  up by the thing I hope so yep there it is okay I don't think I'm gonna have enough strokes to do it
[9244.79s -> 9276.22s]  oh my god it's still not even close wait what where's the ball what's going on why does it say
[9276.22s -> 9294.84s]  it's down why is the ball down here did you go out of bounds I'm very confused what happened
[9294.84s -> 9319.38s]  there's a penalty it's got to go right through the middle it's grayed out over there all right
[9319.38s -> 9322.98s]  well this is obviously just restart the whole fucking thing restart restart this is stupid
[9323.54s -> 9335.61s]  restart I forgot Nintendo does the thing where it's remember I told you I I want a fucking I
[9335.61s -> 9344.94s]  want a I want Congress to pass a law a is b and b is a across all these different consoles
[9344.94s -> 9350.62s]  Nintendo wants you to press the right button to accept stuff xbox says no bro hit the bottom
[9350.62s -> 9383.56s]  button I'm gonna get congress involved all right straight ahead this dude's high on wallpaper glue
[9384.44s -> 9398.90s]  hey you don't understand we gotta get the president has to get involved a is b and b is a
[9398.90s -> 9416.94s]  across Nintendo and xbox you don't understand it's really pissing me off don't okay they should have
[9416.94s -> 9423.94s]  all come to an agreement a long time ago okay is it wrong for me to say that if your controller
[9423.94s -> 9433.26s]  is xyba and the competitor's controller is xyba just just come to a fucking agreement and shake
[9433.26s -> 9436.22s]  hands in an office somewhere and be like look we're gonna have the same button with commands
[9436.22s -> 9442.94s]  right like we're going to see playstation gets to fuck around because they're symbols well it's not
[9442.94s -> 9449.02s]  we have square and triangle all right whatever fuck you go you go live in your own world xyba
[9449.02s -> 9457.06s]  should be the same across the platforms that have xyba this is literally who cares
[9457.86s -> 9487.72s]  I do is all downhill is he about to start crying I've I've been really trying to hold it this whole
[9487.72s -> 9495.37s]  time okay so don't go that way honest to god don't go that way what's the route what's the
[9495.37s -> 9506.50s]  right route it's probably to the left over here it has to be as I go across this gap there it is
[9506.50s -> 9515.99s]  downhill don't go so hard we're gonna do six iron at about 140 yards I'm thinking a bit of strong
[9515.99s -> 9538.50s]  wind we'll handle it all right nice okay time for pick cross it's not time for pick cross it's time
[9538.50s -> 9549.62s]  for pick cross when I say I'm gonna play pick cross that's not right now I need to hit it a
[9549.62s -> 9571.96s]  little bit harder than I want to that's in come on that's such bullshit now we go this way which
[9571.96s -> 9581.62s]  will take us oh there's that one over there shit I'm gonna have to get that one later
[9584.76s -> 9588.04s]  all right if I go as hard as I can I can get this at least to the sand trap
[9588.68s -> 9594.97s]  I'm going right there wind is blowing a little bit too we're gonna be going full blast into the
[9594.97s -> 9611.16s]  wind the tornado wind don't fucking screw me here the tornado what happened to the tornado
[9614.68s -> 9628.55s]  now it's I'm in big trouble in Japan the a button is on the bottom on the west Xbox has patents for
[9628.55s -> 9642.84s]  button bottom button on a that can't be real if it is that's fucking insane now I'm so screwed
[9642.84s -> 9650.34s]  what do I do now I can't just keep whacking into the wall I guess this way I'll have to come back
[9654.38s -> 9675.02s]  that'll make it over that hill I hope everyone ps1 games had confirm on circle well that's the
[9675.02s -> 9684.38s]  thing confirm is where circle is on this way on just Nintendo circle is the rightmost button
[9686.15s -> 9695.94s]  a is the rightmost button and that's confirmed on Nintendo it was like that on SNES too yeah and
[9695.94s -> 9704.36s]  then Xbox came along put a on the bottom and made that confirm what are they thinking how am I going
[9704.36s -> 9714.42s]  to lie I can't just run up here I don't think am I going I don't think I can walk up here
[9715.06s -> 9732.25s]  I have 30 seconds to do this but 25 strokes I think I need to level up before I go here
[9732.97s -> 9747.75s]  look at this this is horrible 38 yards all right I'm gonna go like here all right not bad nice
[9752.52s -> 9767.19s]  straight on nothing fancy because you're under leveled
[9769.19s -> 9778.55s]  I probably am 22 strokes I have three holes left this is gonna be a monumental pain in the ass
[9779.19s -> 9783.48s]  to get to the one down there but I have to take what I can take and it's this here
[9796.28s -> 9800.20s]  once that countdown for Picross ends you're gonna be very upset when I don't play the game
[9811.96s -> 9825.75s]  are these worth one coin now I'll play a couple of rounds of Picross I will
[9826.47s -> 9841.80s]  it's gonna be weird with the controller though gonna curve a little bit this wind a lot of wind
[9842.52s -> 9865.54s]  I'm not sure what hurts more just gonna go like this another broken pixel finally okay 19 strokes
[9865.54s -> 9871.21s]  to get two holes this is the hard one this is the one that I'm I have trouble understanding
[9871.77s -> 9880.79s]  I think I have to hit it really hard just smash it so it flies up or I don't know how hard do I
[9880.79s -> 9891.93s]  have to hit this with a six uh six iron I don't know I think I just have to smash it full power
[9891.93s -> 9923.43s]  with the six iron yeah did it go what no it came all the way back uh I have to put this back over
[9923.43s -> 9934.78s]  here there's no hit it with the driver and do backspin I gotta get it back over there
[9935.50s -> 9947.26s]  I have to get this back in a different a better spot no not into the sand thing god damn it I
[9947.26s -> 9957.53s]  didn't want to hit it that hard thank god okay all right drive it and then put how do I do backspin
[9958.33s -> 9963.40s]  standard shot oops no no no no no no I did I wanted to choose I didn't get to choose
[9965.35s -> 9969.03s]  fucking come on I didn't want to do that I was trying to choose a different like spin
[9971.96s -> 9992.63s]  it actually got up there how did that happen I think I can do this spin doesn't matter for
[9992.63s -> 10011.86s]  what you're trying to do okay this is the hard one this is the one that sucks okay this is going
[10011.86s -> 10022.74s]  to curve a lot and there's a lot of wind so I'm going to run into it here all right 15 strokes
[10022.74s -> 10038.95s]  to get one hole there's one more across the whole game I just have to drive it over and over again
[10038.95s -> 10048.04s]  until I get there right oh I should approach from here right because how is that how uphill is that
[10048.28s -> 10062.41s]  I wonder I'm gonna approach from this way god I hope I make this how am I gonna get there
[10064.50s -> 10088.46s]  I only have two minutes it didn't make it yes it did I was looking way too far this is cool though
[10096.25s -> 10104.07s]  I do have to get up there though I don't know how that's gonna happen I don't know I just have to
[10104.07s -> 10116.42s]  guess I gotta go over that dude there's no way um I have to get it on there first I have I have 13
[10116.42s -> 10135.11s]  strokes I'm gonna be all right I gotta go from here to there there's wait um I don't know I could
[10135.11s -> 10140.71s]  hit it that way but I don't think it'll get over there that thing's downhill all right I'm just
[10140.71s -> 10147.06s]  gonna I'm just fucking sending it who cares it's gotta go in this general direction I don't care
[10147.06s -> 10178.34s]  where we're good okay hey I'm actually gonna complete it so this is down I'll just send it
[10178.34s -> 10201.58s]  again I think it'll cross over it should make it across it did all right nice sims music is
[10201.58s -> 10212.66s]  better than this where's the Mario music all right 11 strokes this would be hard to mess up
[10223.10s -> 10244.42s]  Mario's not in this game I think it okay that was good you got it this isn't a Mario game
[10245.46s -> 10268.14s]  he's in the title I have to put I have to whoa why are you doing that what's going on with this
[10268.14s -> 10294.14s]  bullshit I lose points in the other one oh this is bad I don't want to do the qualifier
[10294.14s -> 10306.42s]  I have a pick cross this is fun though I like this all right I have to give it a rating so far
[10306.42s -> 10312.18s]  the person said that if this was not at least a 7.0 and I that person gets banned for a month
[10312.18s -> 10332.74s]  they're in pre-stream chat hmm do what hmm this is not a seven don't kid yourself
[10333.30s -> 10346.55s]  the thing is though it could be it actually could be it's gonna take me actually another
[10346.55s -> 10353.78s]  few minutes to figure this out let me try some of the mini games first doesn't that can really
[10353.78s -> 10363.56s]  change my opinion I want to play some of those like the putt mini games and the driving mini
[10363.56s -> 10377.19s]  game and does exist right sort of the main menu all right is it on the main menu because I we've
[10377.19s -> 10390.71s]  tried this this was cool that was cool what else we got play golf solo challenge okay
[10393.13s -> 10403.24s]  door attack time attack one on one putt get one shot to find the green and one putt to get the
[10403.24s -> 10423.14s]  ball in the hole no aim for the targets okay we need golf battle golf I want to battle golf
[10423.14s -> 10438.42s]  ready okay with uh four cpus I'm gonna play on amateur see look they're all in this game
[10438.42s -> 10442.62s]  they're all in it we have to hear all their voice lines
[10462.62s -> 10487.34s]  wait Pauline's in this cool okay okay mustache guy mustache guy versus Pauline and Donkey Kong
[10488.30s -> 10502.15s]  and Mario strategic technical simple terrain strategy all right special shot
[10502.79s -> 10508.57s]  or it's full energy shape shot top view whatever time for battle
[10511.35s -> 10534.25s]  first of three flags wins where is it where's my ball this is fucking stupid
[10544.81s -> 10551.32s]  did I not get it wait what happened oh it's gone all right I'm going for this one
[10552.04s -> 10557.29s]  let him fight for one who cares I'm going to I'm going for this one over here on the right
[10564.52s -> 10593.50s]  all right putt putt it putt it putt it fuck I got one Donkey Kong is one away I'm gonna do the
[10593.50s -> 10597.42s]  effective thing of turning around and driving the wrong side of the road Mario Kart I don't even
[10597.42s -> 10614.09s]  care if I win I'm just gonna fuck it up everybody else okay where's the hole Donkey Kong's he's gonna
[10614.09s -> 10632.31s]  win Donkey Kong's up there I gotta stop him stop how do I fight him how do I stop him what do I do
[10632.95s -> 10674.22s]  stop sliding where's my ball hit it okay that was that was outrageous sure very cool let's go back
[10674.22s -> 10689.51s]  to the main menu I want to see the other thing battle golf target golf let's do this and you
[10689.51s -> 10698.76s]  know what fucking fine I gotta play I'm up that character's weird for a second I was like who is
[10698.76s -> 10725.42s]  this what Mario character is that all right we'll do we'll go against um Bowser uh Rosalina
[10726.90s -> 10746.49s]  and Mario forest volcano go into the volcano who is Rosalina you don't know who Rosalina is
[10748.86s -> 10755.21s]  Mario Galaxy hit the targets to score points high score after five shots wins all right score
[10755.21s -> 10760.02s]  the moat we've got to land we're doing it's one at a time right all right
[10761.54s -> 10770.34s]  which one's worth more points I'm going right in the middle here is there any wind barely any so
[10770.34s -> 10786.25s]  it's gonna bounce a little bit that way here we go every you're in the middle you couldn't you
[10786.25s -> 10795.50s]  can't get better than that oh you can that's all right that's a good start here comes Bowser
[10804.20s -> 10811.38s]  this is so this is champ difficulty which just means they're gonna get it in the middle every time
[10820.76s -> 10829.40s]  yeah it's gonna be a perfect shot every time Mario is gonna mess it up he's like a comedian
[10829.40s -> 10846.63s]  right where's Picross you'll see it in a minute okay ball one ball change what's this
[10848.63s -> 10864.31s]  egg ball key change what's the ball do what's the egg ball do just further away with more points
[10864.95s -> 10887.18s]  and does that mean that the middle's already been claimed play it safe okay no win play it safe
[10887.82s -> 10903.34s]  it's downhill I need like one like right like here that's what it does it bounces around
[10903.34s -> 10909.64s]  roll back all right whatever you're having a great day uh I'm having a pretty good day yeah
[10909.64s -> 10923.53s]  hope you're having a good day what was that oh get out of here with this bullshit yeah okay
[10923.53s -> 10956.44s]  I was gonna say that shuts points off nothing come on hurry up what I'm in type of third place
[10957.24s -> 10975.93s]  all right I have one opportunity here I gotta go with this middle ring here it should land
[10975.93s -> 10988.97s]  and bounce right into it how are you this bad at Mario Golf I'm about to potentially tie for first
[10988.97s -> 10996.90s]  place on champion difficulty Bowser is does get can't get enough points to save him here
[10997.46s -> 11002.58s]  as you just saw I'm literally tied for first place and I literally might be tied for first
[11002.58s -> 11015.69s]  place at the literal end of this game that what does Rosalina do bad keep going whatever
[11015.69s -> 11028.17s]  I come in second place he's literally uh there's not even enough points to get enough to win yeah
[11028.17s -> 11040.18s]  I'm second place I'll take second place that's fine 60 I don't understand why they give him extra
[11040.18s -> 11068.71s]  points without literally next game uh it's not over yet that's too bouncy all right I'm gonna
[11068.71s -> 11084.66s]  play Picross that was kind of fun that was that was fun that was fun I gotta give you a rating
[11084.66s -> 11097.66s]  though and I think you're gonna have to ban that guy for a month but hear me out let's figure it
[11097.66s -> 11105.14s]  out I think it's a solid experience like it's fun it needs to be a seven out of ten or that person
[11105.14s -> 11114.09s]  is banned for one full month what makes it bad though bad's a wrong word what makes it not over
[11114.09s -> 11122.87s]  a seven for me I feel like this game is a game that you it's like on the tv in the college dorm
[11122.87s -> 11130.49s]  room and that makes it an eight you know what I mean like this is a college dorm room game
[11130.49s -> 11139.42s]  which makes it a solid eight as a uh as a 36 year old in his office alone I wouldn't say that
[11150.12s -> 11155.10s]  you know I'm gonna be fair I actually okay with that in mind this is like a really good
[11155.10s -> 11159.18s]  piece down like you're in like a college dorm room with friends everyone's like you know
[11159.18s -> 11164.97s]  it's like talking shit and like oh my god you fucked up my shot that's an eight but it's a
[11164.97s -> 11169.29s]  six for me sitting here playing it by myself so therefore the average is probably somewhere around
[11169.29s -> 11187.14s]  7.0 7.1 I'm gonna give this game a 7.2 but they can stay I think this actually could be really
[11187.14s -> 11195.74s]  fun with a group of people more than three or four people all hanging out in a call playing this
[11196.46s -> 11210.01s]  yep that's an 8.0 game for sure maybe more 7.2 it's good and there's like a story mode too it's
[11210.01s -> 11214.57s]  not just like all right that's good it's good I don't I didn't hate it all right let's play
[11214.57s -> 11224.84s]  pick ross and then we're gonna play elden ring this is the worst game ever made it's not
[11229.80s -> 11238.41s]  you gave monster wrencher a 4.2 no idea when did I give monster I gave monster
[11238.41s -> 11244.71s]  wrencher like a nine what are you talking about all right I need is pick ross is just on my
[11244.71s -> 11244.95s]  pump
