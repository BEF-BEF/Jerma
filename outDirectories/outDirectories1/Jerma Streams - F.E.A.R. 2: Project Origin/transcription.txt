[1.08s -> 4.68s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What the fuck is this? I have predict- people can predict stuff?
[5.56s -> 10.04s]  What is this? What- I didn't- when did this get activated? Did this just get activated like a
[10.04s -> 17.10s]  minute ago? I didn't even know I had this. What? Don't spend all your channel points on coin tosses.
[17.66s -> 24.63s]  When did this come through? 1.8 million. Who- you guys doing millions of dollars?
[25.43s -> 30.94s]  You've been betting for an hour. Wait, stop. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[31.02s -> 35.42s]  I- I- I don't- but I don't- the thing is I don't understand. How much are you gonna lose on a coin
[35.42s -> 41.26s]  toss? I don't know. I- I- I turned the stream on. I pressed start streaming and I saw that.
[43.37s -> 49.45s]  1.8 versus 2.3. Well, what the fuck is it gonna be? I- hold on. I go to my details. Introducing
[49.45s -> 53.85s]  channel points. Watch Terma 985. Wait a minute. I gotta go in my settings for a second. Holy shit.
[55.48s -> 65.05s]  You guys saying tails? I got- it's just gonna be coin tosses all day.
[65.69s -> 69.85s]  Prediction results is heads. Oh, but you guys- half you guys lost like two million dollars.
[71.91s -> 74.87s]  Holy shit. Hold on a minute. I- wait, give me a second while I figure this out.
[77.50s -> 86.71s]  What? Panel points. Hold on. Manage rewards. Smart costs for- no. Where is it?
[87.43s -> 96.06s]  Community challenges. Where's predictions? How do I do this? 4.1 million goes to sticky brick.
[96.78s -> 105.02s]  Wait, what? Why did one person win? Why- is this like Mario Party? Did he get it first? Did he come
[105.02s -> 111.16s]  in first place and when you come in fourth place or over you get like two coins? I don't understand.
[114.68s -> 118.36s]  All right, I don't even know how to turn this on or off. It's just gonna- it's just gonna have
[118.36s -> 122.52s]  to be like this, I think, for a while. Turn it off. I don't even know how to turn it on.
[123.24s -> 131.51s]  Okay, community challenges. Default rewards. Keep it on. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. How to play.
[132.23s -> 140.58s]  Details. Point toss. Predictions. Manage rewards. Here we go. Okay, enable channel points.
[142.06s -> 148.04s]  I don't- there's no way to do anything. I can't- I don't think I can even turn it off. Manage
[148.04s -> 152.52s]  rewards and challenges. Customize points. Enable channel points. I don't have like a predictions
[152.52s -> 166.62s]  tab. Custom rewards. Default rewards. Community challenge. I can't even turn this off. Okay,
[166.62s -> 173.16s]  anyways. Hi guys, how you doing? It's tails and heads forever. That's the- welcome to the stream.
[174.14s -> 180.46s]  I lost 120k thousand channel- don't stop gambling until I- don't use this until I get something in
[180.46s -> 186.52s]  here. I want to- this is the oh shit game. This is oh shit game 2. Dermasucks just gave 20 community
[186.52s -> 194.49s]  subs. This took me way off guard. I was not prepared for this. Is there a place I can change this
[194.49s -> 207.91s]  stuff? I don't think I can. What about if I go here? Review recent raids. No, what? I can like
[207.91s -> 216.86s]  see who raided me? I didn't know you could do that. It's slash predictions. Slash predictions.
[217.66s -> 225.37s]  Flash predictions. Unrecognized command. That didn't do anything.
[226.17s -> 232.63s]  Why do people keep looking at so many subs right now? That was 20 community subs from
[232.63s -> 241.24s]  Dermasucks and then 10 from Zurkda. Right in the browser. Oh, hold on. Good call. Sorry,
[241.24s -> 244.84s]  this is throwing off the whole beginning of the stream, but like I- I did not even know I had this
[245.56s -> 249.08s]  until- I didn't even know what it was. I'm looking at heads and tails. I'm like,
[249.08s -> 255.10s]  what the fuck are they doing? Okay, let me see if I can do it in the browser.
[255.66s -> 265.74s]  It's brand new. Yeah. How do I- I don't have a pro- prediction result is heads.
[267.26s -> 275.14s]  Wait, hold on. What the fuck, dude? I didn't even- don't lose all your money already.
[275.70s -> 280.10s]  Once- open a setup menu to create and manage predictions. Thank you. All right, let's go.
[280.90s -> 290.65s]  Okay. Manage predictions. Coin toss. Okay, start a prediction. Oh shit. All right, here we go.
[290.65s -> 297.88s]  Boys and girls, here we go. Um, how about this one? Possible outcome. I- I wish I knew I had this.
[297.88s -> 303.00s]  This is- uh, all right. This is gonna take me a little while. I have to set some stuff up for
[303.00s -> 312.44s]  this. Who wins? Derma Mars or Derma Merc? It's five minute period. What do you mean who wins?
[319.38s -> 328.26s]  Who wins? Okay, I'm gonna do who wins. Derma Mars or Derma Merc. Start prediction.
[330.82s -> 334.98s]  You or a mod will need to confirm the outcome within 24 hours at the end of the prediction
[334.98s -> 339.70s]  submissions. Once you start a prediction, you cannot change it except to delete it or close
[339.70s -> 343.94s]  submissions. If an outcome isn't selected or the prediction is deleted, all channel points will be
[343.94s -> 355.19s]  returned to participating viewers. Okay. Um, who wins? Derma Merc or Derma Mars? I don't even know
[355.19s -> 374.66s]  what that means. Who wins? But wins what? Do I have to decide who wins? Holy shit, Derma Mars is-
[374.66s -> 384.17s]  apparently you guys think Derma Mars is gonna win. But what are they- are they fighting? I have to
[384.17s -> 397.82s]  pick. What? No, I can't pick this. 6.4 million versus 2.1 million. Do I actually have this in
[397.82s -> 402.78s]  time to set this up for the rumble on New Year's Eve? Oh my god. All right, don't blow all your money.
[402.78s -> 409.50s]  Turn this off. Don't you- don't- nobody do this. All right, I'm gonna send channel points back. How
[409.50s -> 417.64s]  do I do that? It's too late? Oh, it's not too late. Cancel it. How do I cancel it? Cancel. Cancel. How
[417.64s -> 425.19s]  do I cancel this one? Did I do it? Did I cancel? How do I cancel it? You got rid of it?
[425.19s -> 430.81s]  Oh, all right. Good, good, good, good. Okay. So, wait, who is starting predictions then?
[430.81s -> 434.97s]  Is it mods? Are the mods just trying to get you guys to lose money? Wait, did everyone get scammed?
[435.77s -> 444.20s]  You should have got it back. Okay, so the mo- all right, so for a second I thought that you guys
[444.20s -> 450.52s]  were activating the coin toss. All right, you got it back. Good. All right, hold off on this.
[451.56s -> 455.64s]  We'll- I want to get some stuff done for this because now that I know I have it, I can't wait
[455.64s -> 459.72s]  to use it. I want- I've wanted a system like this for a long goddamn time and now it's here.
[462.31s -> 465.43s]  Just some normal guy, thanks to the five subs. Thanks to the five community subs.
[466.15s -> 471.27s]  What about all the coin tosses I lost? Yeah, sorry. You can't go into- you can't go into
[471.27s -> 477.11s]  a Vegas casino. Go play roulette for an hour. Lose a bunch of money and say, hey, I want a refund.
[477.11s -> 486.97s]  I didn't have- I want my money back. That wasn't fun. They don't give you a receipt
[487.53s -> 493.64s]  every time you make a bet at a Vegas table. Yes, I'll take five dollars on Blackjack, please. And
[493.64s -> 500.47s]  they're like- like print you out a big CVS receipt. Sir, you've busted. Oh, I didn't like
[500.47s -> 504.55s]  the outcome of that. I'd like to have Red Jack return that hand. Okay, yeah, hold on. Let's
[504.55s -> 509.51s]  process that. They have to take it to the back and somebody says a manager has to sign it and you
[509.51s -> 519.82s]  get a five dollar bill back. No, no, that would be impossible to play. All right, let's go. Today
[519.82s -> 525.06s]  we're gonna play Fear 2 and I've got some things to tell you. I've got a little thing to talk about.
[525.86s -> 533.42s]  Let's talk about some things. All right, listen. Listen up. So, I am going to- here we go. Take a
[533.42s -> 538.14s]  break, Andy. Here he comes. He's gonna say it. Going on break, Andy. Here he comes. Delay, Andy.
[538.14s -> 545.50s]  Delay stream, Andy. Okay, so we're gonna play Fear tonight. I'm gonna try to stream very early
[545.50s -> 551.43s]  tomorrow. I'm gonna try to get a good stream in tomorrow as well. I have a lot of things to take
[551.43s -> 556.31s]  care of. I've got a lot of things to do. I've got a lot of holiday stuff to do. I am going to be
[556.31s -> 562.47s]  disappearing for a week. I'm not gonna be around. Well, I'm gonna be working on stuff and doing
[562.47s -> 571.38s]  things and doing holiday things and- because the New Year's Eve stream is both a rumble and
[572.26s -> 577.62s]  the award show and I want to make sure I get that situated too. So, I'll be on break. Break, Andy.
[577.62s -> 583.86s]  Here he comes. Talking about going on like an eight or nine day break after tomorrow. So, with
[583.86s -> 589.38s]  that being said, I'm going to- tonight's gonna be a meaty one. Okay, we're gonna- I'm gonna be here
[589.38s -> 596.54s]  for- I'm not- this is not gonna be a four hour stream. I'll be- I can say- I'll be here for a
[596.54s -> 601.02s]  longer than that. I'll be here for- I'm not gonna be here for four hours. This is gonna be a little
[601.02s -> 607.88s]  longer. It's gonna be five hours. Fucking pug jam. You hear that one? That's right. Five hour stream
[607.88s -> 615.29s]  tonight. Can you believe it? But I will be back to get the festivities going for the end of the
[615.29s -> 623.21s]  year. But yeah, let's go. I- sorry that it's been 10 minutes to get started here. Year two is coming
[623.21s -> 630.36s]  up. I'm so glad I have that channel points thing though. It makes things so much more interesting.
[631.75s -> 637.59s]  It's not just like spend 1200 channel points to give an emote a mustache. Like this is- this is
[637.59s -> 649.96s]  real stakes now. Okay, let me- let me get started. Good link. They added a billion to the debt
[649.96s -> 657.46s]  counter. Why? For the impossible quiz and that's incorrect. I love how we have debt auditors that
[657.46s -> 664.15s]  are on the case. No, no, no. Excuse me. I've been- I've been an auditor. I've been looking at this.
[664.87s -> 670.50s]  All right, let me get the game open. Fear 2. Never played this before.
[671.46s -> 681.46s]  Let's get started. New deal. Hold on. Okay, Otto's Adventure is outdated. Let's put this on stream.
[681.46s -> 699.88s]  Let's find out what you guys want. Let me see here. Okay, Otto's Adventure is outdated. Yeah?
[700.84s -> 703.00s]  Otto's Big Adventure, A Dog's Day Out, full movie.
[704.70s -> 711.66s]  Eight years ago, okay. Remake it for 2.5 billion off the debt. Otto's Pogtastic Adventure,
[711.66s -> 726.98s]  A Dog's Day Out, remastered. Okay, deal. I agree. Deal. You got a deal. I will do a remastered
[726.98s -> 737.24s]  Otto's Pog Adventure. You ever gonna continue Hades? You quit at like the beginning of the game.
[737.24s -> 739.80s]  It'd be like quitting Binding of Isaac after four floors.
[743.85s -> 752.15s]  All right. Listen, I know. I've got a lot of things going on at the moment. It's a- I love
[752.15s -> 756.76s]  that game. It's a game of the year. Yes, I got four floors down in Binding of Isaac and said it was
[756.76s -> 764.12s]  the game of the year. Yes, but it's true. You know that. I know it. Everybody knows it. It has to go
[764.12s -> 770.74s]  on the main channel. Oh, you're gonna have to sweeten the deal there. No, no, I don't think
[770.74s -> 775.19s]  you can. I don't know about that. I don't know about that. That's gonna have to be much more.
[777.66s -> 783.45s]  To put that- to have that be the last upload on my main channel. You know how many people are gonna
[783.45s -> 788.01s]  just forget that I existed? That's gonna show up in their sub box and they're gonna think that I'm
[788.01s -> 796.14s]  on drugs and like I've gone like just over the edge. Like, oh, it's been like- it's been like
[796.14s -> 802.22s]  four and a half years since a German 95 upload. Oh, I remember this guy. It's Otto's Pogtastic
[802.22s -> 813.13s]  Adventure. I don't know about that. I feel like this is five billion- no, it's gotta be higher
[813.13s -> 828.31s]  than that. Higher than that. Ten- what is- okay, what's the debt at right now? Three billion if
[828.31s -> 835.45s]  you use that thumbnail. Is it at fifty? Did you- no, I thought I thought I got- we need some
[835.45s -> 840.02s]  auditors to take a look at this. Oh, yes, I'm interested. I'll do it. We gotta get the right
[840.02s -> 845.96s]  price though. Let's play Fear. Fear 2, actually. Sorry about that. Let me get that correct.
[846.68s -> 854.01s]  You guys will figure it out. You guys will figure it out. It'll- you guys- I have confidence you
[854.01s -> 865.21s]  guys will know what you're doing. Camera's not on, right? Okay, just making sure. Is this Fear? No,
[865.21s -> 875.72s]  don't do any coin tosses. Don't- do not humor them. Okay, so, all right, give me one- give me one
[875.72s -> 880.20s]  second. I just want to grab- I want to grab- hold on. I gotta grab something. I gotta- hold on. I'll be
[880.20s -> 961.51s]  right back. I'm gonna sprint. Right back. And make sure you get in your- no, just getting nominations
[961.51s -> 967.77s]  are closed. Sorry. You had your chance. Uh, the voting for the New Year's Eve Awards, by the way,
[967.77s -> 977.99s]  will be up pretty soon. So, you're- the actual voting will be available probably by the end of
[977.99s -> 984.06s]  this weekend or by Monday, I would say. Somewhere around Monday. You need to do a face cam. I don't
[984.06s -> 989.77s]  have any clothes on. Okay, I promise if I get jump scared once, I will turn on a face cam. It's not
[989.77s -> 995.29s]  gonna happen. This is not a scary game. I'm not gonna get scared by this game because this game
[995.29s -> 1004.30s]  came out back when Little Girl is Scary was huge. And holy shit, if a little girl is, like, on camera
[1004.30s -> 1008.84s]  and she's standing at the end of a hallway, she's fucking terrifying. That doesn't scare
[1008.84s -> 1019.06s]  me anymore. I've seen it a hundred times. Back in, like, 2008, 2007, whatever it was.
[1019.06s -> 1024.50s]  Why are you naked? I'm not naked. I just don't have clothes on. You can be- you can- you can have
[1024.50s -> 1027.86s]  clothes on and be naked. And you can have- not have clothes on and not be naked. I don't even know
[1027.86s -> 1032.01s]  what I'm saying. I put my headphones in and music started playing and I just- I got speech jammed.
[1032.01s -> 1039.59s]  All right, let's go. I got so sorry. I got speech jammed when I put on the headphones.
[1039.59s -> 1040.09s]  Let's-
[1048.68s -> 1055.08s]  Okay, let's go. Single player online play doesn't exist anymore. There's no way it does.
[1056.52s -> 1064.78s]  All right, campaign. Fear 2. Reborn. I don't know. It's doing normal difficulty. What's hard
[1064.78s -> 1073.64s]  or easy? It's three. This is halfway there. God almighty, he's so high. I'm not high. I'm on hard.
[1073.64s -> 1077.64s]  I'm not putting on hard. I don't do hard anymore. Back in, like, 2012, I would have put it on hard.
[1077.64s -> 1083.40s]  Not now. 35-year-old Jeremy does not play games on hard. He plays games for the story and for,
[1083.80s -> 1089.45s]  the comedic material. I don't play games to look cool and be good. I play games to laugh at people
[1089.45s -> 1102.65s]  like getting hit by a car. I don't care anymore. I'm playing on normal. You've been diverted from
[1102.65s -> 1108.10s]  an assignment to assist- I'm still good at games, by the way. You've seen me play recently. I'm still
[1108.10s -> 1112.52s]  cool. And I know that any time you have to say that you're still cool, it means you're not cool
[1112.52s -> 1122.01s]  anymore, but I know I still am. All right, Svod- Svod D. Mission in the Auburn Industrial District.
[1122.01s -> 1130.31s]  Your new orders are to proceed to the private residence of Genevieve Orestide of Aracham
[1130.31s -> 1135.43s]  Technology Corporation and take her into protective custody. She will instruct you
[1135.43s -> 1143.06s]  where to escort her. Is this a 90 FOV? I hope so. I didn't download any community mod patches
[1143.06s -> 1168.98s]  or anything. Is this a 90 FOV? Why is this so low? Volume? It's 65? No, it's not. I remember
[1169.06s -> 1182.71s]  optimizing my fear 2 experience. Uh oh. You need to optimize it? All right, fear 2.
[1184.15s -> 1192.98s]  What? What the heck, man? Scared. Oh my god. Little girl with a teddy bear. She must be scary.
[1195.10s -> 1198.06s]  Little girl with a teddy bear. There may have been some blood on the teddy bear. That
[1198.06s -> 1206.63s]  might be scary to me. This is dark. Hold on. Right off the bat, I already see a problem. Just
[1206.63s -> 1216.15s]  give me a second. Yeah, that's got to go down. All right, how about FOV? Video settings. You
[1216.15s -> 1220.47s]  know you're in trouble when the only video settings in game are brightness and a resolution. Okay,
[1220.47s -> 1233.78s]  what about um whatever. You should invert the aim. I want to name scary. Mac in 2012. That
[1233.78s -> 1243.48s]  was terrifying. That's still too high though. Hold on. It's got to go to like zero. Okay,
[1243.48s -> 1258.76s]  that scared me. Where did I go? All right, let's go. How does this still feel like too high of a
[1258.76s -> 1276.41s]  mouse sensitivity? Go in and not only that, but there's like scary music box music.
[1278.14s -> 1279.58s]  Got me. It got me. I gotta turn the cam on.
[1286.44s -> 1290.84s]  No, that didn't even get me. That didn't get me. It wasn't even that that got me. It was the fact
[1290.84s -> 1296.52s]  that I was looking at the music box and I sat down weird on my chair. There was a glass on it and it
[1296.52s -> 1304.12s]  hurt my bump. I don't have clothes on. Hold on. I can't. Hold on. It's gonna have to be in a minute.
[1309.40s -> 1314.60s]  Our job is to secure this. Where are we driving? Are we driving off road? I don't want any breakage
[1314.60s -> 1319.24s]  even if she resists. We're bumping around like we're like the tower of terror. She's directly
[1319.24s -> 1323.48s]  linked to the bloodbath at Armicam headquarters. It's like a Universal Studios ride. It's like
[1323.48s -> 1327.32s]  the back to the future ride. She's a high value target and we've been tasked to bring her in.
[1327.32s -> 1333.24s]  So that's what we're going to do. Put on a seatbelt. Lighten up, Tom. She's a suit. What
[1333.32s -> 1337.88s]  she gonna do? Send a nasty text message? She's not the problem. Okay, for a second I thought
[1337.88s -> 1342.04s]  that was my finger over there pointing at them like yes, no, you talk. Now what do you have to say?
[1344.92s -> 1349.72s]  Fox, you're with Stokes. Keegan, you're with me. Beckett, Red,
[1349.72s -> 1352.12s]  Manny will drop you off in front of the building. It's a lot of people. That's us.
[1353.08s -> 1361.54s]  Shit. Why do I get into a bucket? Let's move. These guns. Okay, the guns. They're kind of
[1361.54s -> 1364.02s]  pointing them and I don't like how they're pointing the guns at each other.
[1364.02s -> 1368.66s]  Some people trigger discipline. Our mission is to find Aristine, not Cabaret.
[1369.30s -> 1373.54s]  This pop is bullshit, man. What's so important about this chick that the cops can't pick her up?
[1374.42s -> 1379.70s]  Yeah, I don't know. Dude, do you want to start taking hits at that fire extinguisher? Like,
[1379.70s -> 1382.50s]  fuck it. What's just us here? That situation is getting out of control.
[1382.50s -> 1390.15s]  Nah, dude. Not at all. All right. I'm just kidding. All right, here we go. PDA,
[1390.79s -> 1404.97s]  gun. Okay, I can't even shoot at him. Really? Okay. Access PDA. Place Genevieve
[1404.97s -> 1409.40s]  Aristide in protective custody. Rendezvous with your team in the building lobby.
[1409.40s -> 1414.44s]  Facecam. Why a shift? Aim down sights. That's not going to happen. Let's go back here for a sec.
[1416.20s -> 1419.32s]  Wait a minute. I got to brush my teeth. I got to brush my teeth. All right,
[1419.32s -> 1422.04s]  I'll put a face cam on, but I got to brush my teeth first and I got to put clothes on.
[1422.04s -> 1425.16s]  God fucking dammit. I didn't want to put a face cam on today. All right,
[1425.16s -> 1426.76s]  I'm going to brush my teeth and I'm going to put clothes on.
[1429.45s -> 1433.99s]  Just wait a minute. I'll be right back. Hold on. Just hear some cool art for a little while.
[1433.99s -> 1659.94s]  Let me just brush my teeth, put some clothes on. I'll be right back.
[1659.94s -> 1664.98s]  All right, guys. The lawn needed a little work too, so I wasn't prepared for the stream yet.
[1665.94s -> 1672.18s]  I haven't cut it in like six months. I'll be live in actually a few minutes. I'll be live soon.
[1679.22s -> 1681.54s]  All right. Am I ready? I'm going to get this ready.
[1682.42s -> 1687.78s]  Fucking face cam, man. God, scary games. I lost like a thousand viewers. What am I going to do now?
[1687.78s -> 1693.50s]  No one's even going to watch me anymore. All right, relax. You'll be fine.
[1693.50s -> 1698.30s]  Ooh, I'm the giant rat that makes all the rules. Of course you are.
[1698.94s -> 1713.08s]  All right, what do we look like? Let's see. How are we doing today? I told you I had to put
[1713.08s -> 1717.88s]  clothes on. I had to get like a shirt. I had to get like, I had to brush my fucking teeth.
[1718.68s -> 1728.55s]  I had to like go like this with my hair. I had to go like, how many boogers on my hands? No,
[1728.55s -> 1741.82s]  we're good. Nice v-neck. I own a lot of v-necks actually, so. Okay, wait a second.
[1744.04s -> 1756.57s]  Wait a second. Nice villain hair today. The thing is, I think every day is villain hair,
[1756.57s -> 1763.70s]  if I'm honest, at this point. Okay, so this is where I'm going to be sitting, like this.
[1764.26s -> 1777.67s]  Am I going like this in my mind frame? How does that look? Do I look evil? How does it look with
[1777.67s -> 1790.42s]  the game up? Am I blocking like ammo and shit? I probably am. You want to get a real close look?
[1791.30s -> 1801.88s]  I didn't frame my nose hairs yet, never mind. I ain't getting a close look today.
[1802.52s -> 1824.86s]  Okay, I think we're good. Face cam is in the wrong spot. There, now we're good. Okay, I'm ready.
[1824.86s -> 1833.46s]  Do it blue again. I can't just turn it, okay, let's go. What would I have to do? Can't shoot him.
[1834.02s -> 1843.50s]  All right, right, right, right, right. I told you this is gonna be a long one. Key bindings.
[1843.50s -> 1847.93s]  Where's my chapstick? Where's my chapstick? I can't, I cannot stream without, I cannot stream
[1847.93s -> 1857.77s]  without my chapstick. I gotta have my chapstick. I don't, I don't have my, I don't have my chapstick.
[1861.91s -> 1872.62s]  I'm actually furious about that. Okay, movement. It's uh, interaction. Shift. Mouse button two is
[1872.62s -> 1881.99s]  already assigned to melee. What kind of drugs make it, no. What? This needs to be sprint.
[1883.74s -> 1894.57s]  Or sprint. Is alt? Excuse me, it's not. Sprint, shift. Shift is already assigned to zoom. Yes,
[1894.57s -> 1902.86s]  that's, no. What are you doing? I don't want it to be alt. What are you doing? All right, zoom is
[1902.86s -> 1919.08s]  mouse two. Okay, let's go. Much better. Much better. Okay, I'm ready to play the game. No melee.
[1919.72s -> 1930.95s]  Don't get too close. They'll see your nose hairs. Hey, and by the way, I just shaved too.
[1930.95s -> 1936.63s]  What do you guys think of that? This is, this is like, I just literally shaved. Shaved my face.
[1936.63s -> 1942.71s]  Clean shaven. What do you think? I'm supposed to be playing a game. Like, who cares? Who cares
[1942.71s -> 1962.95s]  if I just shaved? What am I looking for? A reload? What did I do? I already forget it. What we were
[1962.95s -> 1975.66s]  just doing? Melee. Okay. Interaction. Melee is this button. What should I do? V? Mouse button? No,
[1975.66s -> 1979.62s]  no, no. I want mouse button four. All right, the game doesn't even know you have mouse buttons.
[1979.62s -> 1991.40s]  Middle mouse? V. V is assigned to thermal vision. Oh my fucking god. I don't know. I'd like,
[1991.40s -> 1998.25s]  what the fuck do you put it? Alt? Alt is already assigned to sprint. No, it's not. Who has alt for
[1998.25s -> 2008.73s]  a melee? Wait, what did, what did I just do that for? Why am I, why am I sliding? Is that a slide
[2008.73s -> 2027.54s]  tackle? Whatever, let's go. Okay, so we gotta go, where are we gonna go? Place? Yeah, yeah, rendezvous.
[2027.54s -> 2033.74s]  All right, so we can't go in the front door. The sensitivity is still too high. I don't even know
[2033.74s -> 2054.04s]  how that's possible. It's at fucking zero. This is zero sensitivity, by the way. It's zero. Go through
[2054.04s -> 2058.44s]  the coffee shop? All right, well, I'm trying to figure out how to get to the coffee shop, dude.
[2059.00s -> 2066.55s]  Turn it up all the way. It's not gonna even do anything. All right, we're going that way.
[2066.55s -> 2070.87s]  Eat the chapstick. Hold on, I'm too busy trying to not have my brain explode out of my front
[2070.87s -> 2083.14s]  of my eyes because I can't turn the sensitivity down. DPI is up. Yeah, I can't even change it.
[2083.14s -> 2100.73s]  Cool. No DPI button. Yeah, the thing that I complained about so much. You guys remember when
[2100.73s -> 2106.78s]  I used to sit here and talk a ton of shit about the DPI button. I was like, Razor, holy shit,
[2106.78s -> 2112.54s]  remove this. This button sucks. Fuck this button and fuck you, right? I've done it probably a
[2112.54s -> 2138.06s]  thousand times. Not there anymore and I need it right now. I thought he just screamed at me.
[2138.06s -> 2145.18s]  No, I don't. You're right. The gate's locked. All right, let's go this way. Move. Wait a minute.
[2145.18s -> 2168.07s]  The door. Oh, this door. Okay, I got a flashlight. F. Okay, there's a Vindex. I'm gonna have to
[2168.07s -> 2186.02s]  turn the DPI down. This dude's pretty strong. Holy shit. Look out. Look out. The final offer
[2186.02s -> 2192.70s]  is circulating. Okay. What happened here? How many people are on this team?
[2192.70s -> 2201.98s]  This is a, but it's been locked down. Hold on. Let me get a look. Let me look at that PC.
[2210.01s -> 2217.10s]  Okay, doctor. Making fun of a man for his knowledge is a sign of insecurity.
[2217.74s -> 2222.36s]  We need to find our seed now. Agreed. Fox, secure the lobby.
[2222.36s -> 2225.72s]  Ray, take the stairwell. Rest of you, you and me. The stairs?
[2226.28s -> 2231.13s]  What the fuck? It's a thousand fucking stories. It is a thousand fucking stories.
[2232.09s -> 2252.34s]  Just making sure he was dead. What's with my hair? I'm sorry. That was my fault.
[2252.90s -> 2259.48s]  That was all my fault. I'm sitting here going like, oh, man. How do I look? Hey,
[2259.48s -> 2265.72s]  Sergeant, what do you think? This is for a hairstyle. It's like sniped. Oh, man.
[2270.26s -> 2280.71s]  That was all my fucking fault. Oh, shit. I'm sorry. Vanity got that guy killed.
[2289.22s -> 2302.68s]  Arsenal select. Well, how far are we going? Yeah, it's pretty cool. It looks pretty good.
[2305.02s -> 2322.42s]  Oh, man. Yeah. This guy must've been shot in the aorta. I was ready for that one.
[2322.98s -> 2346.95s]  Got that one down. One more over here. Got him. Moving up. Oh, what? Hey.
[2347.99s -> 2369.40s]  Why did that guy explode? That guy just blew up. Oh, shit. Nice. Let me do that too.
[2370.04s -> 2389.77s]  Oh, is this health? Pick up Intel. Oh, all right. Okay. I'm at the vault now.
[2391.11s -> 2402.76s]  And plan B is going well. I don't read anything in games. All right. I thought that was a pick.
[2402.76s -> 2412.62s]  I could pick that up. This guy was using Windex as a weapon. St. Dead Rising, man.
[2412.62s -> 2429.98s]  That's not going to help you. Blue Gatorade. It's a blue Gatorade. Sprint. Is this sprint or is this
[2430.46s -> 2446.20s]  Lich Hover? Oh, she's in here. Armor vest. Nice. Okay. Bad news. You got armor. Whatever. You missed
[2446.20s -> 2452.26s]  the... Don't tell me I'm going to miss an extinguisher. Are you fucking out of your mind?
[2459.08s -> 2463.00s]  Yeah, there goes fucking $40 million worth of stuff. Sorry. What's that? 50 million.
[2468.28s -> 2475.46s]  Hold on. I got to... Slow down. I know you think it's funny, Jeremy, but slow down.
[2476.02s -> 2482.28s]  Slow down. Hold on. It looks like I got to use my two to travel to get extra speed.
[2483.80s -> 2500.55s]  I'm in. Sorry. I'll take a 50-50. I'll take a 50-50 on that one.
[2503.24s -> 2517.14s]  Health pack. Z is med kit. Okay. Let's go ahead. That is so funny, Jeremy. I'll make me fucking
[2517.14s -> 2537.03s]  ban you. Grenades. G is grenade. Okay. What? I feel like the game's in times two speed.
[2537.03s -> 2547.85s]  Anybody else feel like that? Why does it feel like it's in fast motion? It's because it's old?
[2548.97s -> 2556.18s]  I'm a boomer. Are you sure? I feel like I'm... Am I seeing the world in slow motion?
[2556.90s -> 2569.35s]  Probably because of your DPI. I don't know. The game's going too fast. It's because you're
[2569.35s -> 2579.83s]  stoned. No, that's not it. Can I kill the helicopter? Wait, there might be a secret out here.
[2579.83s -> 2603.53s]  What was that for? It just ruined a plant. That wasn't even funny. Don't deny being stoned. I'm
[2603.53s -> 2617.70s]  not stoned. I'm drinking a coffee. And... All right. Time to come clean. Time to come clean.
[2617.70s -> 2624.22s]  All right. Okay. I'm going to be drinking out of it. I'm going to be honest with you guys
[2624.22s -> 2631.21s]  because I've got a product here. This is not an endorsement. I mean, it kind of is.
[2632.49s -> 2639.45s]  It's not a truly. I'm not drinking coffee and fucking truly. This is a streamer endorsement.
[2639.45s -> 2646.18s]  I was not paid for this. I just thought it was an interesting idea and I did it. By the way,
[2646.18s -> 2650.58s]  I want to make sure I can tell you very... I know. Listen. There's no soy in this. There ain't no
[2650.58s -> 2656.01s]  fucking soy in here. So how dare you say what I think you're going to say. It's a heel. Don't
[2656.01s -> 2669.03s]  fucking say it. There ain't no soy in this. Don't say it. There's no soy product. It's not a soy
[2669.03s -> 2677.11s]  product. It's not a soy product. I'm just trying it. I'm just trying it to see if I like it.
[2677.11s -> 2683.62s]  It's a... I can't do this without sounding like I'm fucking... All right. Listen. Sometimes streamer
[2683.62s -> 2687.96s]  snacks, we talked about them and I was like, all right, so like you get baby food that works.
[2687.96s -> 2692.92s]  That's the, you know, that gives you some fruits and vegetables and shit. I do that. I still do.
[2692.92s -> 2698.73s]  Beef jerky. That's a good one. This is good too for me. It's just like a bunch of calories. It's
[2698.73s -> 2707.16s]  like protein and vitamins and shit and I like it. And nobody paid me to say that. I did. I paid
[2707.16s -> 2713.80s]  myself. I transferred. I transferred. Yeah, I transferred. I transferred $600 into my account
[2713.80s -> 2723.51s]  today. Paid myself for this one. No, all jokes aside, it really is like helpful. Whenever I
[2723.51s -> 2729.54s]  told you I was trying to put on weight, that helped. So all honesty aside, that's why I started
[2729.54s -> 2738.12s]  doing it and I put on a bunch of weight. All right, let's go. You're gonna see it. I know
[2738.12s -> 2747.03s]  people are gonna see it if I took sips out of it. It's not gruel. It all went to your ass.
[2747.03s -> 2758.44s]  It was already like that even when I was losing a little bit of weight. Gamer gruel. All honesty
[2758.44s -> 2770.20s]  aside, all right, I gotta play the game. Where was I going? And there's no soy. There's no soy in
[2771.27s -> 2786.28s]  None. So all of you that want to call me that word, sorry, you can't do it. Okay, fire mode.
[2786.28s -> 2793.93s]  B is burst fire. Oh, that's single shot actually. Play the game, you clown. I am. Just hold on. I
[2793.93s -> 2800.71s]  had to do my fucking heal endorsement. I really was not paid to do that. I just like it. So give
[2800.71s -> 2817.64s]  it a rest. All right, forget about new fire mode. I have to turn the D. Okay, next. When I go on
[2817.64s -> 2828.12s]  break, the DPI is going to like two. This guy's unstoppable. Are they talking about me? All right,
[2828.12s -> 2833.02s]  headshots only. I think I can do it. Single shots. Okay, headshots only if I don't get it.
[2833.02s -> 2848.02s]  Never mind. Just play. Uh, don't I have a health kit? Isn't it Z? Oh, I guess I can. Can I just
[2848.02s -> 2865.54s]  walk in this? It's gonna be something with the debt. No, it's not. Shotgun? Sick. Grenades? Sick.
[2865.54s -> 2885.50s]  Fuck it. That's all. Pick up what? Orcs? Oh, you can't like throw spoons at people? Shit.
[2894.86s -> 2906.25s]  Well, um, turn the fucking DPI down. How do I do that? Somebody help me. How do I turn the
[2906.25s -> 2921.06s]  DPI down on my mouse? Like mouse settings, right? Stoned off. DPI plus four. F4. Razor Synapse. I'm
[2921.06s -> 2924.90s]  not downloading that fucking pro. I will not download that program. I would rather play like
[2924.90s -> 2933.11s]  this than download that. Um, how do I do it? Do I actually have to download that? No, I don't want
[2933.11s -> 2940.22s]  it. Term of blue. What? You need to download and fix your game. I need to download a fix for the
[2940.22s -> 2958.09s]  game. Are you serious? Don't tell me that. That's a lie, right? PC gaming wiki. Fear 2 mouse fix.
[2958.09s -> 2962.41s]  What is this? This makes Fear 2 use raw mouse input and removes the game's dead zone and
[2962.41s -> 2978.30s]  sensitivity problems, right? Okay. Extract this. I gotta close the game. I need to- where's the-
[2978.30s -> 2985.53s]  where's the save point here? Exit to win- just watch some artwork. I'll be right back.
[2985.53s -> 3149.24s]  We're gonna go long today, I promise. All right, let's see if it worked. That image. That image.
[3149.80s -> 3158.49s]  The image of me existed on the internet. That I hated. It was the worst photo ever. I was like,
[3158.49s -> 3162.33s]  I fucking hate that photo. I wish something would take it over. Something would be more
[3162.33s -> 3169.66s]  popular than that image of my face that I don't like. And then the monkey paw curled. And that
[3169.66s -> 3185.88s]  image has just gone crazy. And it's just- you- be careful what you wish for, as they say. So,
[3185.88s -> 3195.74s]  you know. The monkey paw, yeah. Just be careful what you wish for. It just might come true.
[3197.50s -> 3205.90s]  Indebted. Hey, banana bros! All right, let's see if this worked. Hopefully this works. I
[3205.90s -> 3212.86s]  did all the instructions. Hopefully it worked. Fix your damn game. We're going long today. Don't
[3212.86s -> 3218.79s]  worry. I'm here for a while. It's gonna be more than a four hour stream. Don't you guys understand?
[3218.79s -> 3223.16s]  Watch this be like a virus or something that I just downloaded and I'm an idiot.
[3223.16s -> 3227.58s]  I looked on the first link in chat and all of a sudden, like, my computer gets compromised.
[3227.58s -> 3250.04s]  Guys, I'm in his computer. There's a ton of porn. Okay. Come on, please work. Oh, look at that!
[3254.65s -> 3261.02s]  Did it work? Guys, it worked. Everything is perfect. We're ready to go. I'm ready to play
[3261.82s -> 3268.92s]  Fear 2. Are you ready to enjoy this journey with me? I hope you are. Let's come on back now.
[3269.56s -> 3287.10s]  Oh, shit. That's fucking incredible. Look at how good I looked. Oh, Genos and Smash. I already
[3287.10s -> 3298.38s]  read it. You can't make me sad anymore. I already read it. It's never gonna happen. He's just always
[3298.38s -> 3306.90s]  gonna be like a fucking sticker for the rest of his life. Oh, whatever. Who cares? Let's go.
[3306.90s -> 3320.57s]  Getting to count Olaf here today. I kind of like it. There we go. Look at that. It's a video game
[3320.57s -> 3343.61s]  now. There we go. It's a video game now. It's a video game. I can play the video game. God damn
[3343.61s -> 3362.31s]  it. Whatever. I was trying to do something cool, but it failed. How do I crouch? Am I dead? Whoa,
[3362.31s -> 3369.59s]  what? No deal. No deal. Deanna is forced to sing the Jerma Raid song.
[3372.86s -> 3386.86s]  What are you guys doing to her? Okay, I'm good. You forced her to sing the raid song.
[3387.66s -> 3396.54s]  What is, why are you guys doing this? Hold on. I have to watch it. I'm playing a video game. I'll
[3396.54s -> 3410.18s]  watch it in a minute. That sounded like a character. I don't know what one. That wasn't Adam Sandler.
[3410.18s -> 3423.98s]  No. That guy was waiting for me. Do I have any grades? No, I don't want to burst fire, dude. Give
[3423.98s -> 3431.26s]  me like the, okay, there it is. You always sound like Adam Sandler. I don't think always. Maybe
[3431.26s -> 3442.47s]  sometimes. All right, let's go. I need a health pack. I don't always sound like Adam Sandler.
[3445.59s -> 3455.05s]  By the way, I'm having some trouble with this game. What does that bar mean? Better. Is that
[3455.05s -> 3466.44s]  health or what? Is red? I don't understand what it means. I don't get it. It looks red, but there's
[3466.44s -> 3481.58s]  no, it's not decreasing. Dude, please quit touching your hair. You're making it worse.
[3482.22s -> 3503.56s]  Don't you make fun of my hair. Okay, here we go. That was an actor. That was, that was a stunt man.
[3508.23s -> 3519.91s]  He even went. All right, watch it. I'll watch it. Hold on. Let's see. You know, this is forced to
[3519.91s -> 3546.68s]  sing the raid song. Scream overreaction. That's not her. Let's see. Literally, you're a handsome
[3546.68s -> 3555.42s]  Jack. I don't have the things here. Why am I blue? Because it's because my screen is blue.
[3555.42s -> 3584.41s]  What do you think I am? Blue? All right, here it comes. That's pretty good. That's way better
[3584.41s -> 3621.00s]  than what I do. That came out of nowhere. Clapping my ass right now. Get that off.
[3621.93s -> 3635.62s]  Hey, you get off. Don't right now. Don't. Don't actually. I have to hide right now. I have to,
[3635.62s -> 3649.18s]  I gotta hide. I gotta turn the camera off. I gotta hide. I'm back. Fucking cooler than ever.
[3649.90s -> 3674.07s]  I'm not blue anymore. Clapping my ass. Why is it locked? All right, it's not gonna happen to me.
[3678.71s -> 3732.94s]  All right, does this guy just fall off by himself? Come on. He does it every time.
[3736.38s -> 3744.94s]  All right, I want more health. Are you okay? I want more health. I wonder what, okay, if I,
[3744.94s -> 3767.00s]  what happens if I like go up, hold on. I'm not gonna kill him yet. Why did it not explode? Why
[3767.00s -> 3803.06s]  did it not explode? All right, get me in this. I have to go in this. I have to go in there, right?
[3803.06s -> 3850.81s]  Uh-oh. Kill it. Okay, whatever. Can I swim? So what? Hidden door. Remember, you look handsome.
[3850.81s -> 3879.58s]  How about now? I don't need more. Turn the cam off now. That's a lot of people.
[3880.14s -> 3911.00s]  Is there a grenade? I still got it. I don't care about the lore.
[3911.00s -> 3923.96s]  Little girl scary. This is the whole game. Okay, what do I, I hurt my shoulder.
[3923.96s -> 3953.94s]  There's a piano. Hold on. Piano. Why does it just turn into like a cut oak tree?
[3953.94s -> 3967.13s]  Okay, let's go. When do I get the superpowers? Do I get, do you get superpowers in this game?
[3967.13s -> 3978.62s]  When is, oh shit. I don't, I, that's all I care about. No, you don't, you thought you looked cool,
[3978.62s -> 3984.66s]  but it was kind of cool. But you should have just held the trigger down when you heard the
[3984.66s -> 3998.09s]  footsteps in front of the door. Scary girl. Where is she? Scary girl. She's around somewhere.
[3998.65s -> 4007.82s]  Why is my instinct to just shoot her? I can't, I feel like she's going to turn around and come
[4007.82s -> 4015.72s]  try to kill me. You know what I think it is? It's me just pre-firing the jumpscare because if she
[4015.72s -> 4019.48s]  turns around and screams, I'm already, like the gun's already screaming, so I'm already ready.
[4035.77s -> 4072.41s]  All right, secret. Hold on a second. Just hurt. It was hair. It was my hair though. It was,
[4072.41s -> 4080.63s]  it was my hair. That was my hair. That was my hair. I remember, it definitely fell in
[4080.63s -> 4084.23s]  because it was long and it was, it was like blonde and brown. It was this long.
[4085.72s -> 4109.26s]  That was my hair. Or it might've been, I don't know. I think it was mine. That was shot out
[4109.26s -> 4113.74s]  into the screen if I didn't, I wasn't careful. I was about to just start cracking up with it
[4113.74s -> 4117.82s]  in my mouth. Don't ever drink when you, don't ever do that. That's a thick liquid too. Don't
[4117.90s -> 4124.09s]  laugh while you have a thick liquid. I'm like talking, I was like, oh yeah, you, man.
[4126.54s -> 4132.12s]  I swear to God that was my hair. I know it was. Trust me. I know what it looks like. I know what
[4132.12s -> 4142.39s]  it looks like. I just want you to know the things I like, okay? It's a product I like.
[4143.03s -> 4163.35s]  Okay, I'm going to lose my mind. I have to relax. He's malfunctioning.
[4163.83s -> 4167.11s]  You and your squad are the only hope of stopping Ulma.
[4170.95s -> 4191.16s]  No, what do you have here? It's protein. Soy. Okay. There's no soy in this. Read my fucking bottle.
[4191.16s -> 4201.93s]  My bottle doesn't have that word. Hey, what's that say right there? Can you read it? Soy free.
[4202.73s -> 4215.14s]  Absolutely soy free. This is probably a different product. This is a, this is
[4215.14s -> 4225.35s]  bullshit and you're a liar. You can't, you can't put one over on my eyes. I have a game to play
[4225.35s -> 4232.86s]  and I haven't done anything. It's gluten. Hey, let's, let's read it. 27 vitamins and minerals.
[4232.86s -> 4240.57s]  Fucking POG. 20 grams of plant-based protein. POG, no soy. Omega-3 and omega-6. Six grams of
[4240.57s -> 4244.97s]  fiber in this fucking thing. Phytonutrients. I don't know what that word means, but it sounds
[4244.97s -> 4251.58s]  pretty scientific. Only five grams of sugar. None of this like fucking 40 grams of sugar.
[4251.58s -> 4257.46s]  Bullshit soda crap that you drink. Gluten free and soy free. So what the fuck's your problem,
[4257.46s -> 4263.13s]  man? It's good. I like it. I'm going to keep drinking it. Whether you like it or not.
[4263.69s -> 4281.40s]  Streamer loves hairy drink. It's my hair. That was my own fault. Water is superior.
[4282.60s -> 4291.70s]  Water is good too. I drink water too. Oh, we have to extract this person.
[4292.10s -> 4303.14s]  It's her. Stubborn son of a bitch probably just killed us all.
[4304.02s -> 4313.43s]  You got a new clip for me? Hold on. I'm busy. What the fuck just happened to you?
[4314.95s -> 4319.82s]  I'm playing a game. Is this some kind of, I'm like a simulation or something.
[4320.46s -> 4341.21s]  What do you want me to do? I guess I just leave? Shoot. Can't press any buttons or anything.
[4341.77s -> 4363.61s]  You're Hue-lucinating. I'm going to catch her. God damn it. I can't believe one of my fucking
[4363.69s -> 4380.82s]  hairs fell in. Was that supposed to be on screen? I feel like that was supposed to be a little
[4380.82s -> 4401.50s]  bit more blurry. Did we just get nuked? What? Why did we get nuked? Oh, I got to make room for the
[4401.50s -> 4436.25s]  fuel. Oh, it's good shit. It really is. I swear to God. Like Agent Smith's or something? That was
[4436.25s -> 4449.86s]  the ending to Fear 1. Was it? I don't remember any of that. What's this? You guys are spamming,
[4449.86s -> 4460.04s]  you guys are spamming me with a video. I'm getting spammed. You don't pay attention to
[4460.04s -> 4470.81s]  Laura. That's why. Guys, I played Fear 1 like three years ago. All right. I'm gonna, I'm gonna,
[4470.81s -> 4474.17s]  I'll listen to the video. I'll listen to the video. What do you guys want me to hear so bad?
[4475.99s -> 4487.05s]  Jerma is so nice. A piece of slime that's been scraped off of the bottom of a sewer. What?
[4487.05s -> 4495.03s]  And Jerma is like a piece of better slime that has been scraped off of the top of the sewer.
[4495.67s -> 4498.95s]  He's the top of the sewer and I'm the bottom. Wait, I didn't.
[4502.78s -> 4512.97s]  Okay. Um, I think I'm fucking carved out of stone, if I'm honest with you. I think that
[4512.97s -> 4519.38s]  fucking God threw down lightning down and Saint Peter fucking carved me out of a goddamn slab of
[4519.38s -> 4532.28s]  stone. Zeus struck the lightning down. It turned into me. Exactly what somebody that is at the top
[4532.28s -> 4543.74s]  of the slime would say. Oh, okay. Sure thing. Whatever. He's stoned. Okay, I did not expect
[4543.74s -> 4552.95s]  that guy to be there. Ego maniac. And use a gun. And if that don't work, use more guns.
[4553.51s -> 4569.26s]  Grab it. What are they doing to me? He's alive. Holy shit, that's not how you have surgery done.
[4572.84s -> 4586.01s]  What are they fucking doing? Oh my God. Oh, we're gonna we have just as general appendix surgery.
[4586.01s -> 4587.45s]  Nothing that we have to be afraid of.
[4590.01s -> 4592.89s]  This is just two guys playing surgeon simulator on some asshole.
[4597.27s -> 4616.18s]  That was insane. This game is fucking crazy. I don't have any organs left.
[4620.52s -> 4635.69s]  I have no organs. Put your gamer glasses on. I don't have any. Google Glass. All right. Intel.
[4635.69s -> 4654.65s]  Who cares? Find a weapon. I'm gonna okay. I've been I've swallowed so much air from laughing
[4654.65s -> 4662.04s]  at random stuff while trying to drink at the same time. So it's gonna happen. I try I'm gonna try
[4662.04s -> 4667.02s]  as hard as I can. This is why I don't put cameras on. I fucking hate webcams. I don't want a web
[4667.02s -> 4676.94s]  cam on me. I don't get it off. Turn it off right now. Is that toilet backwards? Isn't that supposed
[4676.94s -> 4688.39s]  to be the other way? Why is that? That looks different to me. No, no. Right? No. Isn't that
[4688.39s -> 4693.96s]  like the lip is crooked? Yeah, I know. But like isn't the lip this the space is there? I guess
[4693.96s -> 4712.92s]  some toilets have the space. I need a weapon. It's not a weapon. Get out of this fucking place.
[4713.64s -> 4735.70s]  Oh, are you in terms of service? No, but I'll be fine. I'll be fine. Don't worry. Are you afraid?
[4735.70s -> 4739.14s]  I mean, I could be a little a little a little chilly right now. You know, I'm a little cold.
[4739.78s -> 4765.56s]  Uh, I'm not scared. You should be. Well, I'm not. Wait, okay. I thought that was a guy leaning back
[4765.56s -> 4771.96s]  with a gun. Like N64 style. Like he like he looked like Polygon. I thought he was like had a gun back
[4771.96s -> 4775.64s]  there. I was like what the fuck is this guy with a gun doing back here?
[4781.91s -> 4794.62s]  Save the game? I think it's doing it. It's automatically doing it. Open. Open the door.
[4795.26s -> 4825.69s]  Why do these don't open? Okay. Oh, a professional doctor. Did it hurt me? Oh, it's for cover. I get
[4825.69s -> 4856.94s]  it. Blood. Blood. Smash or I don't know. Whatever. Oh no, more blood. Blood. Blood. What a weird
[4856.94s -> 4864.07s]  substance. It's so bizarre that we have like human oil that like makes us run. This is weird.
[4875.50s -> 4889.45s]  Uh, well, how do what am I supposed to do? Is there another way to go? Restricted area.
[4889.45s -> 4907.11s]  Uh, running in circles? No, I'm not. I'm here. Here's. How am I speed bagging this thing?
[4907.11s -> 4913.98s]  Jerma, go read an analog clock. Give me one. Give me one. Give me a time. I'll do it right now. I'm
[4913.98s -> 4926.39s]  not high. I've not had any CBD, any THC, none today. Zero. Read any analog clock you want.
[4926.39s -> 4938.86s]  Can I just go in? Whoa, it's control. Hold on. Is this something? I can't like get out of this.
[4938.86s -> 4968.18s]  Come on. What? Oh dude, this is really spooky. It kind of is. What was he holding? Is this a bottle
[4968.18s -> 5001.78s]  of hydrogen peroxide? Where did he even come from? It's Pepto-Bismol. I need a gun, right?
[5001.78s -> 5006.62s]  I'm getting more. There's more spam going on here. All right. After this, no more links.
[5006.62s -> 5020.60s]  Wait, are we going to do this thing? Hold on. I need to put like a different shirt and pretend
[5020.60s -> 5027.03s]  like I'm seeing this another day. Give me one. Give me a second. Hold on. I'm going to put like
[5027.67s -> 5029.91s]  another game in the background too. Hold on. Give me one. I'll be right back.
[5053.19s -> 5059.11s]  Oh, this is fine. I can just put this around my neck and stuff. This works. I have different
[5059.11s -> 5079.56s]  hair though. Look at all these cat boys. I'll change my background, right? I'm wearing like
[5079.56s -> 5089.70s]  a big elaborate sweater today. I'm not going to be blue. I'll be, I don't know, green. Yeah,
[5089.70s -> 5109.58s]  it's like a different day. Yeah, it's really sunny up today. I just woke up in the morning
[5109.58s -> 5122.65s]  and like this is like it's tomorrow. I'm going to be like, what the fuck is this?
[5122.65s -> 5141.19s]  Sounds like it was bright this morning. Okay. Well, I need the video. I'm going to be fucking
[5141.19s -> 5165.64s]  mad that you guys linked this to me this early. What the fuck is this? It's too early for this,
[5165.64s -> 5174.38s]  dude. It's way too early for this. I just fucking got up and you guys are linking me this.
[5179.45s -> 5190.58s]  When was this? Yesterday? Whatever. I'm going back to bed. Fucking come out of here.
[5190.58s -> 5216.95s]  I hate this. Just turn the stream off now. Turn off the stream now. Like I was never live.
[5217.91s -> 5231.21s]  No, I have to play fucking Fear 2. I went to bed. It's tomorrow. Restart. You've ruined it. What?
[5231.21s -> 5243.53s]  What do you mean restart? Do it again? You choked in the end. You were fucked in the head. Oh,
[5243.53s -> 5254.41s]  I read that wrong. I'm not even at the tutorial. Too early for this. All right. I have to play
[5254.41s -> 5271.66s]  the fucking game. Don't mind me. I'm here, but I'm Sansom. Fuck. It's just going to do
[5271.66s -> 5281.32s]  what it's going to do and I don't care anymore. Yes, I do. Of course I do. All right. Can I please
[5281.32s -> 5315.02s]  play the game? It's been ages. I thought he said Colonel Sanders. Colonel Sanders, I've taken them
[5315.02s -> 5323.96s]  out. Oh, that's good. Now come back. We're a $5 fill-up box. We can't let them get away with
[5323.96s -> 5343.62s]  their secret rash at me. I need a gun. You're a budget Anakin Skywalker. That's okay. Like,
[5343.62s -> 5347.22s]  do you think that's going to make me mad or like pissed off or something? Why would that make me
[5347.22s -> 5354.18s]  angry? The most powerful fucking Jedi on earth. The coolest, most destructive, awesome force of
[5354.18s -> 5360.97s]  a person. Budget that. That's still fucking one of the best in the world. So I don't care. That's
[5360.97s -> 5368.79s]  fine.
[5373.99s -> 5382.71s]  THC lab. All right. I know. I know. I can't believe it. I can't.
[5384.18s -> 5426.14s]  No? Okay. Gotta go to the THC lab. What's this face I'm doing? Ambush. I still need a weapon.
[5426.22s -> 5454.06s]  Slow-mo. He's dead? Look at that guy. What? Why did he explode? Was he made out of glass?
[5464.02s -> 5466.66s]  That's what it is. Okay. Wait, wait, wait.
[5470.89s -> 5485.56s]  All right. I'm fine. I don't want to hear that. X marks the spot. Nope. And links. No more links.
[5485.56s -> 5502.15s]  I ain't looking at any links. No more links. I gotta get out of the tutorial first. Hey,
[5509.99s -> 5540.71s]  you guys. What the fuck? Oh shit. Come on. We have bugleberry soldiers. I don't die.
[5541.43s -> 5593.98s]  Oh, is he still shooting? It was rigor mortis. Oh, he's still alive? Okay. I'm coming to save you.
[5593.98s -> 5606.28s]  Open the door. I'm here to save you. I'm here to save you. I'm here to rescue you. Ma'am, open the
[5606.28s -> 5619.72s]  door. I'm here to save you. Open the door. I'm trying to get you out of here. Ma'am, I'm trying
[5619.72s -> 5639.37s]  to help you. Open the door. Any snacks in there? Watch this. Which one's going to be left or right?
[5639.37s -> 5677.03s]  Open, open, open, open. What? Is he dead before we hit the ground? No. Oh shit. Did they remove it?
[5677.59s -> 5695.69s]  That was like the best part of the first game. Anymore? Oh shit. Open the... I fucking missed it.
[5695.69s -> 5712.15s]  That was supposed to be scary and I just turned around. The camera is out of sync.
[5712.71s -> 5747.53s]  No, it's not. It is. What the hell are you talking about? Oh, it isn't. You made that up. They did.
[5747.53s -> 5766.02s]  Of course they did. I know they did. Can I get up there? Oh, go this way. Steam hurt? No, it better
[5766.02s -> 5776.42s]  not. I'd be pissed if it did. Locate a working elevator to the third floor. Melee. Okay, Melee.
[5776.42s -> 5795.06s]  Hey, don't look over here. No, redo that part. I want to kick him down the elevator.
[5795.70s -> 5808.17s]  Redo that part. I want to sneak up behind him and kick him down the elevator.
[5808.17s -> 5817.53s]  Melee fans. Melee fans. Melee fans. What are you saying that for? All right, let's go. It's
[5817.53s -> 5834.30s]  literally a half second behind. That's impossible. There's nothing on there that would... This is
[5834.30s -> 5845.06s]  impossible. It's impossible and I'm not even gonna give it any more thought. Okay, here we go.
[5855.82s -> 5882.50s]  Just get down there already. Okay, we're good. Who's next? Got a grenade. I can't get in here.
[5882.50s -> 5889.40s]  Don't even need to be in there. Who cares? It's delayed. Listen to the people. The webcam is
[5889.40s -> 5917.00s]  delayed. I've had just about enough of this shit. How's that? Does that sound good? Fixed. Fixed.
[5917.00s -> 5920.76s]  Worse. Worse. Oh, that's really funny because I didn't do anything at all. I just clicked the
[5920.84s -> 5924.44s]  webcam on and off, pretended to change the setting, and then you guys pretended it got worse.
[5924.44s -> 5948.58s]  I win. I like that blue. It's a nice blue. Stop smurfing, bro. What do you mean stop smurfing?
[5949.14s -> 5955.18s]  There's no levels in this game. All right, scratch the itchy face part of my face.
[5955.18s -> 5991.61s]  Got a key card. Based. You're based. Smurf. All right. Reflex injector. I mean, where am I?
[5991.61s -> 6002.12s]  What just happened? Reflex injector? What does that mean? Urgent warning. No. Tab. Where is it?
[6003.83s -> 6017.69s]  Why do I keep teleporting around? Somebody will help me. Whatever. I don't care. This door can
[6017.69s -> 6031.13s]  open. No, it can't. Can I go in another door? How about this one? Upgrades the slow-mo duration.
[6031.13s -> 6044.12s]  Oh, okay. Cool. Where else am I supposed to go? Did I get everything in here? I don't actually
[6044.12s -> 6070.42s]  have to move this, right? You're so bad. Dude, the heal crash is real. The heal crash. Yeah,
[6070.42s -> 6094.41s]  because I had to go in here. I can't move this. Press E. I can't do anything. Use your brain. Use
[6094.41s -> 6117.93s]  your mind. E. I don't think I am. Where am I supposed to go? I went down here. I've already
[6117.93s -> 6130.38s]  been in here. Was there another key card door to go in? Oh, okay. Over here. Why is everything
[6130.38s -> 6144.42s]  blocked off by boxes? I win. Did I miss another jump scare? What's the cam even on for if I'm
[6144.42s -> 6161.75s]  just going to miss these? Oh, that's a monk at TOS. I shot him. I stopped that. I very clearly
[6161.75s -> 6172.28s]  shot that before it happened. Come on. I played House of the Dead before. That's bullshit. I want
[6172.28s -> 6210.14s]  my extra one health. They just explode. Damn. Damn. Oh, damn. Any more? Getting just blood splatters
[6210.14s -> 6213.66s]  in your face and having bullets hit you in the head is way more scary than the girl walking
[6213.66s -> 6226.90s]  slowly behind a glass door. Shotgun. Oh, hell yeah. Finally. It only took 100 million years to get
[6226.90s -> 6257.00s]  this. Wait. It's still tutorial, right? Never mind. You already shot gun. What? This way. Getting
[6257.00s -> 6267.80s]  close to the lobby. There's some kind of activity. Check out the activity in the lobby. Got it. Oh,
[6267.80s -> 6304.86s]  shit. I'm not that scared of this. All right. Which one is she in? We're going to unzip number
[6304.86s -> 6310.02s]  one. Unzip number... No. Which one are we unzipping? Who's going to come out of the morgue and who's
[6310.02s -> 6340.95s]  going to grab me? Hopefully this wasn't like a prank. All right. Going up. The entire game is
[6340.95s -> 6364.49s]  a prank. Out of coffee. That's a problem. Now, how do I get it to move? Here we go. Get to the
[6364.49s -> 6371.08s]  third floor. Third floor. This would be the second floor. Is this the third floor? What floor is this?
[6371.08s -> 6402.04s]  Why is it not moving anymore? Press and hold. I'm not soft-locked. I'm fine. Lots of body armor,
[6402.04s -> 6408.63s]  which I think is awesome. All right. Something behind this door. Slow-mo through here. Nope.
[6408.63s -> 6428.12s]  Can't go through here. Of course we can. Of course not. You're right. There's a million clocks on the
[6428.12s -> 6442.41s]  wall. Oh, shit. Okay. It is exactly 3 p.m. Three o'clock. Done. See? I'll do another one. Wait,
[6442.41s -> 6463.99s]  why would all the clocks be different times? Dude, the guys that explode. It's just... He wouldn't
[6463.99s -> 6472.52s]  even aim it at me. Like I was playing VR. His gun was like bouncing all around. Like down, up, left,
[6472.52s -> 6482.95s]  right. You got... Hey, you got... Sorry. Room's not big enough, dude. You got to do seated play. What
[6482.95s -> 6505.56s]  does that do? All right. Frag grenade. He slowly realized that that was not going to stop and
[6505.56s -> 6517.53s]  explosion from killing him. Oh, fuck. Pick it up and throw it back. Oh, jeez. Hold on.
[6535.61s -> 6551.00s]  Look at his little... His little like shimmy. Oh, I'm on fucking fire. How do I get to...
[6552.52s -> 6562.49s]  Turn the sink on. Oh, you dick. This reminds me of the time that I had a wart on my finger. Me too.
[6563.45s -> 6584.23s]  Wow. We're so alike, you and I. How did you miss that? There we go. That was creepy. What?
[6584.95s -> 6602.66s]  No, that was like a, hey, you and me. We get it. That was creepy. You never been like, hey, hey, hey.
[6602.66s -> 6615.08s]  Hey, easy. Hey, you're an ego. You never been like, oh, yeah, hey, we're going to go over here.
[6616.12s -> 6631.85s]  Yeah, here we are. That's like a nudge. Like, hey, hey, you and me. We get it. You know,
[6632.57s -> 6645.10s]  ladies and gentlemen, fellas, I was begged to wink every day. Every single day of my life,
[6645.10s -> 6652.49s]  I was begged to wink to you. And now all of a sudden, when you don't have to pay for it,
[6653.05s -> 6670.23s]  when it's free, you don't like it anymore. What is going on there? I don't know. I thought that
[6670.23s -> 6688.20s]  was a pineapple. Too bright. Don't like it. All right. Where are we going? Where are we going?
[6689.59s -> 6734.86s]  Get to the THC lab. Let me get into the chamber. Oh, come on. Pay attention. This is like driving
[6734.86s -> 6753.40s]  a car and looking over at somebody. Pay attention to the road. I can turn into a skeleton.
[6755.24s -> 6770.87s]  I'm adjusting my VR headset. I tell you, this is a VR game. Honey? Honey, it's dad. Simpson's
[6770.87s -> 6805.35s]  thing over there. Hold on. I wish I could slow it down. What the fuck was that? Was that a mole?
[6805.99s -> 6812.23s]  Did I have somebody on the inside? Did he press the button and start firing at them?
[6812.23s -> 6825.26s]  The guy on the left. What was that? There it is. Finally. Finally, we got it. Finally, he says it.
[6826.14s -> 6836.73s]  Finally. It took two hours. Holy shit. Oh, I'm so glad we get to hear it again. I missed it so much.
[6848.10s -> 6857.16s]  You're just working the angle, Jerma. What does that mean? I changed the camera? So it doesn't
[6857.16s -> 6867.59s]  look like I'm trying to work an angle? Should I put the camera somewhere else so I'm not trying
[6867.59s -> 6871.35s]  to make it look like I look good or something? What do you mean, working the angle? Like this
[6871.35s -> 6894.25s]  angle? What if I sit back here? You're working it. What do you mean? If only I was good at
[6894.25s -> 6900.20s]  multiplayer games like this, I could get rid of people like this. Jerma, you're playing dense.
[6900.20s -> 6910.98s]  I'm 35. I don't know any words on the internet. Guys, I haven't posted a selfie of myself or a
[6910.98s -> 6917.74s]  picture of myself to the internet like ever. The Twitter fucking Thanksgiving ham video was
[6917.74s -> 6930.97s]  the last time I did it. I don't know what that means. Hey, Esoteris, thanks for the ten community
[6930.97s -> 6942.52s]  subs. Thanks a lot. So two weeks ago. Yeah. And then go back half to two weeks. How long has it been?
[6944.22s -> 6965.98s]  Like years. Sing the sub song. Here you go. This is what you want. This is why everybody's here.
[6966.46s -> 6969.43s]  Don't fucking pretend like this is not the reason why you're here.
[6979.90s -> 6987.82s]  Take it and run with it. That's why you're all here. Did that hurt?
[6987.82s -> 7002.60s]  Oh, we got out of the tutorial cutscene. Jerma keyboard font. I don't know what that means.
[7002.60s -> 7008.31s]  Wait, you want like a... I can't... I don't... What? You want me to make my own font?
[7008.31s -> 7025.91s]  Next grenade type. Next grenade type? Incendiary grenades. Oh shit. Oh shit. This is very flammable.
[7042.47s -> 7046.39s]  I feel like he just set that up wrong, right? I feel like I didn't even do anything. Like,
[7046.39s -> 7062.44s]  I don't think that should have happened. He installed that incorrectly. The energy of your
[7062.44s -> 7074.78s]  stream is off. What do you mean? Energy? What does that mean? The energy of your stream is off.
[7075.72s -> 7094.39s]  You're talking about like at my audio level? You need more vibe. Okay. This is for a vibe.
[7095.11s -> 7107.58s]  I'm playing the game now. You're too loud. You just walk next to an explosive. Well,
[7107.58s -> 7111.18s]  I'm not paying attention to the road right now. I'm looking... I'm talking to one of the passengers
[7111.18s -> 7119.40s]  in the car here. So like this is what I'm talking about. All right, hold on. Watch this. Ready?
[7119.40s -> 7151.16s]  Do you know... All right, so somebody was just like, you know what? I'm gonna kill both of them
[7151.16s -> 7160.54s]  because like this is the chance I got and he's standing there still. So I'm gonna go for it.
[7160.54s -> 7165.42s]  Harry, I'm sorry, but this is the guy and I'm just going for it. He's standing still.
[7165.42s -> 7204.94s]  Why am I shaking? I love it so much. The whole stream is a prank. I don't think so. What do you
[7204.94s -> 7226.76s]  mean? That was a default. Holy shit. Why can I pick this up? How the... Okay. How can I pick
[7226.76s -> 7237.18s]  that grenade up? Different grenade type? Yeah. Wasn't I holding five? Your vibes are better.
[7237.18s -> 7253.62s]  You could get it. What's this crack that I'm seeing? Oh, fuck. Got him. Okay, we're good.
[7264.73s -> 7274.90s]  Wait. How did he burn? What is he doing? What the fuck? He looked at it and it made him catch
[7274.90s -> 7301.24s]  on fire. Why? Whatever. Hey, look, we got good vibes now. Where should I go? In here? I heard
[7301.24s -> 7321.91s]  grenade. Why did that last so long? Good vibes and chill. Yeah, that's true. That's what I'm
[7321.91s -> 7334.34s]  talking about. Boom. Yeah, we're just chilling out. What are you guys talking about? Oh, my...
[7334.34s -> 7341.54s]  I gotta use my shotgun for a little while. Hold on, wait. Live, laugh, love.
[7341.94s -> 7353.18s]  Hard mode. This is too easy, please. No, I'm just vibing, right? We're just hanging out.
[7357.10s -> 7374.66s]  I say it and everybody gets mad. Nice. Thank God. I was gonna be so mad if I couldn't hit
[7374.66s -> 7393.08s]  that phone off the wall. Okay, where? Beers? Hold on, wait. Did he just respond to that by saying
[7393.08s -> 7416.65s]  shit? What the fuck is going on? Oh, he didn't throw it very far. Back up. Back up.
[7423.50s -> 7436.23s]  There's a lot of smoke. The smoke just everywhere. Okay, hold on. Give me the shotgun again.
[7445.50s -> 7472.54s]  What was that? Did I shoot myself in the chin? What? What the hell was that? It was the fire...
[7472.54s -> 7483.66s]  Wait, those explode that far? That's crazy. That's not what it was. No, guys, that was not what it
[7483.66s -> 7496.73s]  was. I want to check that out. All right, hold on. That's a huge explosion. It was what it was. Okay.
[7497.61s -> 7509.98s]  I did not think that was gonna happen. Nothing? Okay, down here. How the fuck do you do that? I
[7509.98s -> 7539.22s]  don't know. Somebody said, it's okay. Vibes stable. Thank God. I thought that was a clown.
[7539.22s -> 7554.02s]  I'm gonna be honest. I thought that was a clown. Whoops. What's he doing? What's he reaching for?
[7554.02s -> 7592.87s]  What are you doing? What the fuck is this guy? Die! Okay, give me that thing. Oh shit, nice.
[7593.43s -> 7610.79s]  Let's do a spy check. He's doing the thing the stuntman does in every movie.
[7612.52s -> 7618.86s]  This thing. When they're on fire and they just go like this, they're engulfed in fucking flames
[7618.86s -> 7628.36s]  and they just do the... And they just slowly are taking one or two little steps at a time
[7628.36s -> 7635.90s]  because it's like, holy shit, this is a real dude and he's really on fire. So you have to be really
[7635.90s -> 7645.66s]  careful. Imagine being in that suit though and just knowing like, holy shit, I am completely
[7645.66s -> 7655.03s]  engulfed in fire. Everything from head to toe. I am a golem from... I'm a golem. I'm the fire
[7655.03s -> 7662.26s]  golem from Diablo 2. Not a golem. A golem. That's what I was trying to say. Golem from Diablo 2.
[7662.26s -> 7666.78s]  Fire golem. It would have been... You would have understood if I said it faster without stopping
[7666.78s -> 7688.81s]  and going... And then blocking it in my brain. Delay's getting even worse. Okay, sure thing.
[7692.18s -> 7700.78s]  Fix it, idiot. I don't know how. Fucking idiot streamer. Can't do anything.
[7706.17s -> 7744.98s]  Fucking idiot. All right. Shotgun. Take it. Shotgun. Got it. Oh no, vibe levels are critical.
[7745.72s -> 7752.38s]  What do I do to fix the vibe levels? Why does he move his whole body to dodge things?
[7753.18s -> 7759.02s]  Because I don't know. That's something from Super Mario. I got it from my mother.
[7759.02s -> 7765.50s]  Anytime my mother wanted to make a jump across a platform or something, she would always do this.
[7766.22s -> 7769.66s]  So she would be running, right? Like Mario's running across the screen and she would jump
[7769.66s -> 7775.19s]  and she'd go... And it somehow helped. It helped her get to the other side somehow.
[7776.86s -> 7790.09s]  And I don't know. It's just that it stuck with me. Mama. That's right. That guy was terrible.
[7790.73s -> 7825.67s]  He's alive. Shit. Grenade. What? Okay. I was going to say that didn't... This game's like fun though.
[7825.67s -> 7830.57s]  I actually kind of like this. You kicked at his ankles and it killed him. Yeah. Well,
[7830.57s -> 7849.00s]  he only had like two health left. What is it? Oh no, his vibe levels. His telesthetic vibe
[7849.00s -> 7860.20s]  levels are critical right now. They're off the charts at the moment. Easy. I've been here.
[7860.20s -> 7891.61s]  Will he know that the grenade's behind him? He's trying to run away. Where did that guy go?
[7914.38s -> 7934.44s]  Holy shit. That was so fucking bad. That was so shitty. That was like... There was just no way he
[7934.44s -> 7939.50s]  was going to be in the bathroom. You know what I mean? There was no reason anyone was going to be
[7939.50s -> 7955.11s]  in here. In fact, I think that's actually the guy. Somebody said, town NPC death sound.
[7963.62s -> 7972.71s]  He walked up to like one of the villagers and just like stabbed him. God damn it.
[7977.46s -> 7990.87s]  Can we hear it? Does anybody have it? This stream has been all over the fucking place.
[7991.51s -> 8003.29s]  Clip's a band. For what? Link's a band. Oh shit. Because I was getting spammed. Oh my god.
[8004.01s -> 8011.56s]  Or not even dead. That's just like you... A NPC in town runs away. Because you pressed Z and
[8011.56s -> 8020.30s]  unholstered your shotgun. Right? And it's just like, crazy guy, run! Like that's in Red Dead.
[8020.30s -> 8023.98s]  You know what I mean? You have the holster and you like pull it out. And all of a sudden
[8023.98s -> 8036.01s]  people are just like... But Link's a band. Whatever. In the saloon, you just open the door.
[8046.74s -> 8054.81s]  I didn't even do that. Did I do that? Did I kill that guy? Was that scripted or did I shoot him?
[8056.89s -> 8081.67s]  I didn't do that. Is the guy's head talking? This guy's head is screaming. What was that?
[8084.58s -> 8100.81s]  You just kicked me like... I can't... Why are you doing this? Stop doing this.
[8106.54s -> 8109.18s]  Where are they coming from? Stop spawning.
[8116.78s -> 8121.58s]  I need a break. I need to take a break. Why are they... I don't know where they're going.
[8125.67s -> 8130.79s]  Why are they all limping? Why is every NPC limping? I'm going crazy pills.
[8131.51s -> 8172.30s]  Okay. Every NPC is limping. Okay. That was a little scary. I'm kind of concerned about that.
[8172.30s -> 8187.93s]  I'm a little concerned. What happened to that guy? That guy's head's gone.
[8188.01s -> 8201.37s]  Oh, shit. I'm afraid to go down there. We're gonna long distance that one.
[8201.37s -> 8230.28s]  Grenades go up. What do you think? What do you think? I don't hear like a radio tune.
[8230.28s -> 8276.26s]  I just came from here. Yeah, I know. But what? Did that guy blow up in here? Holy shit. What
[8276.26s -> 8323.29s]  happened to that guy? You're alive? Impossible. Impossible. Did I get him? I think I got him.
[8333.88s -> 8350.82s]  Throws grenade. Throws grenade. Throws grenade. Throws grenade. Yes. Yes, that's true. Well,
[8350.82s -> 8353.62s]  if I have them, I'm going to use them. Why would I not use the grenades? They're incredibly
[8353.62s -> 8373.48s]  destructive. They're so good. Where do I go? Nade Andy. Whatever. That's fine. I can't open this.
[8373.48s -> 8392.46s]  Can I not get this open? Oh, there was a big X on it. Like this doesn't work. I want more coffee.
[8404.42s -> 8419.13s]  Okay. Oh, health pack. Nice. 5pm coffee. Sometimes you need a little bit to keep
[8419.13s -> 8425.38s]  you going, you know? That's all right. I'd say a coffee after like five or six. You gotta be
[8425.38s -> 8451.50s]  careful. You don't want to do too much. But a little one. That's fine. And me, right? Okay.
[8451.50s -> 8489.38s]  Time to fight this thing. What? How many are there? Oh, what the fuck? Did I get him?
[8495.86s -> 8505.40s]  Okay. We're good. We're fine. We're fine. We're fine. You can't just like bite me and then run
[8505.40s -> 8518.90s]  away. What is he doing? He's trying to get a hiding spot. Give me the shotgun. Shotgun better.
[8521.38s -> 8548.71s]  Oh yeah. They're like little dogs. Okay. Get out. Out, out, out, out. Move, move, move.
[8548.71s -> 8564.34s]  Through the ceiling. Here we go. One, two, three. No. Okay. We're fine. What's going on with this guy?
[8564.34s -> 8577.88s]  Can I do anything with this guy? No. This guy's just dead. Why are they filming this? Get that
[8577.88s -> 8599.67s]  out of here. What the fuck? Yep. I knew it. I was waiting for it. No, you're going to do it. It's
[8599.67s -> 8609.18s]  going to... Didn't do it. Wow. Okay. I'm actually pretty surprised that they did not do that. Oh,
[8609.18s -> 8624.74s]  okay. Remember, you promised a sly cooper. When is sly cooper? Yeah, I fucked it up. My PS3. All
[8624.74s -> 8631.40s]  right. Those either weren't here. My PlayStation 3 smelled like burnt plastic when I played anything.
[8631.40s -> 8637.14s]  So I had to try to find a solution to it. When I play with my PlayStation 3, it smells like burnt
[8637.14s -> 8642.30s]  plastic. Bad. To a point where it makes me give me like a headache. So I can't use it. So I gotta
[8642.30s -> 8653.16s]  figure out what to do. This button will toggle power to the doors. I just locked them and the
[8653.16s -> 8674.89s]  x-ray. Okay. What are they doing? Do an emulator. I actually tried to use an emulator, but I got a
[8674.89s -> 8679.45s]  ton of awful interlacing and it was just ugly and horrible to look at. I tried to do a bunch of
[8679.45s -> 8684.33s]  different settings, try to change what it looked like and just wasn't happy with it. So until I
[8684.33s -> 8700.34s]  can do that, I'm just going to get another PlayStation 3. This is open. Yeah, it was really
[8700.34s -> 8704.36s]  just ugly. Frames were blending and it was, there was a lot of weird ghosting and blending
[8704.36s -> 8713.70s]  and I was just like, I, I'll just buy another PS3. German put art on so I can eat. Um,
[8714.26s -> 8740.01s]  I'll take a break in like 20 minutes. Oh, we're out. Holy. I tried to shoot. That, that guy's
[8740.01s -> 8749.78s]  entire skeleton was okay. That was ridiculous. That guy got like slow cooked for like four or
[8749.78s -> 8753.88s]  five straight days. All the meat just fell off the bone. Like you couldn't, you didn't have to
[8753.88s -> 8782.17s]  try. Holy shit. Watch it. I don't do anything stupid. You got a broken leg. All right. He's
[8782.17s -> 8803.08s]  got a broken leg, a, uh, broken collarbone and a broken jaw. Okay. Fix him. I can't. I'm not a
[8803.08s -> 8821.42s]  doctor. I squeeze through. I cannot squeeze through that. Play Mega Man. Uh, no, not right now. Get
[8821.42s -> 8867.78s]  out of here. It's quiet. It's too quiet. Hey, are you all right? What did he throw? What did he
[8867.78s -> 8906.57s]  throw? What just happened? What was it here? He's back. Why did that guy get a respawn?
[8906.57s -> 8921.19s]  That guy's back was towards me. Well, really painting the barn. I don't even know what that
[8921.19s -> 8941.91s]  means. Gunplay is pretty good in this game though. I like the gunplay. It's, it's really responsive,
[8941.91s -> 8948.10s]  really responsive gunplay. See, when I say the word gunplay enough times, you guys will then
[8948.10s -> 8952.18s]  respect my review coming later because I said that word and you guys go, oh yeah, he knows what
[8952.18s -> 8956.34s]  that means. He's like, he's, you know, the lingo of like playing games, like reviewing him and shit.
[8956.34s -> 8983.11s]  This guy's locked in here. Uh, careful. You have to compare this to Dark Souls. I don't think I can
[8983.11s -> 8989.70s]  do that. I'm not sure that's possible. I don't think I can compare this to Dark Souls. He has
[8989.70s -> 9012.33s]  an extension cord in his body. That's what that is, right? Okay. Whatever. Whatever. It's glass.
[9012.41s -> 9025.29s]  I keep thinking it's, I can shoot through it. I was trying to, alt, alt.
[9040.74s -> 9071.34s]  He got on top of me twice. Fucking sticky keys. Radio? No. Oh, lower disc. You guys do that too
[9071.34s -> 9074.38s]  when there's a bunch of people, you're at like a tourist attraction. Everyone's just taking
[9074.38s -> 9078.06s]  pictures and you're like, I have to fucking go. I have to walk by and I'm not going to sit here
[9078.06s -> 9083.58s]  for like fucking 25 minutes while like 10 of you take photos. Go down, crouch and you like get
[9083.58s -> 9096.31s]  underneath their picture. Who's that? No, I just run across. No, you can't do that
[9096.31s -> 9107.62s]  because then you'll end up, you'll be like a blur. What's that? Oh, nice. Crouching is worse.
[9107.62s -> 9122.39s]  You end up like, there's like a head and somebody like crouching by. I somehow didn't get hit by
[9122.39s -> 9133.38s]  that. I don't know. I don't know how. Uh, can I go? How do I make the elevator go? Go elevator,
[9133.38s -> 9148.70s]  go up. Press the, I just made it. Level three recognition.
[9154.70s -> 9167.70s]  Fuck. God damn it. I got to be ready for it. It's black. I can't even, I can't shoot through it.
[9168.42s -> 9207.10s]  What's going on? Does he swallow it? I feel like he swallowed that. Holy shit. Gulp. Uh, excuse me.
[9208.06s -> 9225.62s]  I gotta go down. Worst, worst. Don't do worst noise. Whatever. Find a way out of the outer
[9225.62s -> 9239.67s]  shell before it is destroyed. Okay. I can do that. Maybe. I feel like I'm playing Portal 2.
[9239.67s -> 9257.26s]  I don't know why. Getting Portal 2 vibes. Oh, he got, wait, he's getting burnt by what?
[9257.82s -> 9263.83s]  Oh, he's stood in front of the jacuzzi jet. Careful, dude. You never, don't ever do that.
[9264.55s -> 9286.22s]  Come on. Jesus. Come on. Oh, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right. Go, go, go.
[9286.86s -> 9309.24s]  Everybody calling me grenade Andy. I mean, you get so many of them and they do so much damage.
[9309.24s -> 9323.00s]  Why wouldn't I use them? I think I've thrown 70 or 80 grenades in this playthrough so far.
[9323.00s -> 9346.30s]  They're just everywhere. Why not just use them? Of course, I'm going to throw them. Um, what?
[9346.30s -> 9349.90s]  I don't know what that was, but apparently that guy killed the other guy somehow. His body,
[9349.90s -> 9367.58s]  I don't know. His corpse was break dancing. Okay. A shock grenade. Ooh. Kind of want to try this.
[9374.20s -> 9383.58s]  What the fuck? CDPR really dropped the ball here. It kind of is the cyberpunk music, isn't it?
[9392.46s -> 9401.58s]  Just goes like, Oh, here we go, man. I'm about to get into a big fight in cyberpunk.
[9412.07s -> 9427.93s]  Cool. I'm dead. Whatever. Oh, that's right. He's making a cyberpunk joke. I have to make one.
[9428.73s -> 9446.46s]  All right. I got to get down there before they get up. Let me in. What are these guys doing?
[9448.30s -> 9455.38s]  Who's driving the forklift? Who's driving the forklift? What the fuck?
[9458.90s -> 9469.14s]  Some guys just like backing up for the forklift. How do you feel about your cyberpunk cameo?
[9469.94s -> 9480.62s]  I don't have a cyberpunk cameo. All right, come on. Got to get in the door before they get over there.
[9493.56s -> 9502.14s]  Is somebody in there still? Punch him. Punch him. Punch him. What the hell is this? An assault rifle?
[9507.05s -> 9529.72s]  Oh, nice. I'm doing okay, I think. The music is kind of overpowering my brain.
[9530.44s -> 9538.78s]  Throw more grenades. I'm already throwing a bunch of grenades, man.
[9564.38s -> 9570.63s]  It's too much stimulation. It's a lot of stimulation. Too much. It's too much stimulation.
[9571.27s -> 9600.10s]  This guy's still alive. Is that guy alive? Wait. No, get down. No, he's just stuck in the ground.
[9600.10s -> 9620.17s]  Okay, whatever. Good vibes only. Swap weapons. E. I know how to do that already.
[9620.17s -> 9633.13s]  He's checking his armpits. He's smelling his armpits to see if he has smelly armpits.
[9634.09s -> 9676.17s]  Got him. He's not going to explode, is he? He might. Oh, get. Where's my red dot? Where's the red dot
[9676.17s -> 9688.74s]  sight? Oh, we're going to get a comedy fall. That was not funny. A person exploding. That's
[9689.38s -> 9721.21s]  not a comedy fall. He was supposed to fall down. Where are they running? What? I feel like I'm
[9721.21s -> 9726.25s]  playing on a tiny map in a shooter game, and people were just spawning and killing each other.
[9726.25s -> 9739.08s]  Spawn, die. Spawn, die. Spawn, die, die. Spawn, die. Just infinite respawn. Instant respawn.
[9740.58s -> 9775.46s]  No reloads. Okay. I don't know. I don't. So, let's. I don't want that. I want the health.
[9775.46s -> 9789.72s]  That was a tuber reaction. What, going like this? Oh, it's links. Is that a tuber reaction? That's
[9789.72s -> 9794.46s]  not really a tuber reaction. That's just a. Well, look at what we're doing. We're killing this guy.
[9799.98s -> 9805.43s]  You know what else? Okay. First impressions of Fear 2. I feel like there's been no downtime.
[9805.99s -> 9812.26s]  It's just been spawn and kill people. Just run through. This is just a never-ending instant
[9812.26s -> 9820.17s]  respawn FPS map. And I'm doing really well. I'm like fucking 75 and 2. I don't even know
[9820.17s -> 9848.26s]  what's happening. What happened to the little girl? What was that? Who puts me down? Gets a big fat
[9848.26s -> 9884.07s]  bonus. Really? I don't think that's. Okay, hold on. Itchy mouth. Where should I go?
[9884.79s -> 9892.66s]  What the fuck? What are you doing? Stop running into explosives. I'm doing really well this game
[9892.66s -> 9896.98s]  with the shotgun. This is a gameplay. This is a good thing I'm recording because this is going
[9896.98s -> 9913.67s]  up on the main channel. This is going to be a big commentary about how I fucking 104 best gameplay
[9913.67s -> 9924.66s]  I've ever put up. Keep this up. I need ammo for that. Can I get rid of this? This gun sucks.
[9933.30s -> 9938.42s]  Okay. What do I want to swap? Yeah. Give me. Why the hell would I use a pistol for? It's stupid.
[9939.06s -> 9952.44s]  What is this doing? Oh, shut off the gas leak. Okay. Do it. Chat demands it. Do demand what?
[9953.00s -> 9978.89s]  Do a game. Game. Oh, all right. Hold on. Oh, you motherfucker. No. Okay. I'm fine.
[9978.89s -> 9997.24s]  How long is this game even? I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do it.
[10001.26s -> 10007.30s]  You ready? Here we go. Hey, what's going on, everybody? Gerber here with another Team Fortress
[10007.30s -> 10013.32s]  2 gameplay commentary. And tonight, gotta be playing in fucking 10 years ago. There it is.
[10013.32s -> 10016.76s]  Finally. He did it. I'm not doing that ever again. It's the last time you'll ever hear me say those
[10016.76s -> 10066.79s]  words. Stop standing up. Talking about sticky keys. Okay. Can I leave? Uh-huh. No. No. You.
[10066.87s -> 10087.22s]  Stop. How do I get by that? Stop. No, I wanted to do that. It's what it feels like to be an
[10087.22s -> 10104.60s]  NPC in this game. You suck. I'm fine. Find a way out. Okay. Do another joke. Okay. Fine. All
[10104.60s -> 10107.96s]  right. All right. Just give me a second. I gotta find like a swamp creature or something in here.
[10107.96s -> 10112.01s]  There's gotta be like a swamp monster I can say yell at or something, right?
[10113.06s -> 10126.57s]  Do one. Just wait a minute. All right. Here she comes. That's what you're using to hold the
[10126.57s -> 10137.40s]  papers down? Like, get a filing cabinet. Why is this like a caveman? Like, a caveman works
[10137.40s -> 10146.04s]  in the office? Like, put this in a filing cabinet. Use big rock. Keep papers done.
[10149.03s -> 10155.70s]  Chunggo, can you please put those in the filing cabinet? Filing cabinet. Scary. Make loud noise
[10155.70s -> 10161.94s]  when open door. That's just, the wheels are a little, we'll put some WD-40 on it. Remind me of
[10161.94s -> 10201.14s]  Giant Bird. Okay. Someone else will read it. Chunggo. Scary! That actually was scarier. Fake?
[10202.02s -> 10216.86s]  Yeah, and like, very overdone. This little guy from Overwatch. This is Arm. He builds a century
[10216.86s -> 10239.34s]  Torbjorn. This is Arm, right? How do I get this open? It wasn't minus two, minus two, whatever.
[10239.90s -> 10253.53s]  He said make a joke. He didn't say make a good one. That wasn't clear. Um, is this something I
[10253.53s -> 10261.98s]  can press in here or activate? Why is the chat adding and subtracting? Well, they're trying to
[10261.98s -> 10271.67s]  tell me how good or bad I am doing streaming. That's pretty much what it is. It's a point system.
[10274.36s -> 10278.84s]  If I say something that's not funny, they take points away from me, which makes me very upset.
[10279.40s -> 10286.66s]  But if they like what I say, they add points, which makes me very happy. New viewer song.
[10286.82s -> 10291.46s]  Welcome to the channel. I'm not, I hate, I'll clear that. I'm not doing this. I'm not going to do that
[10291.46s -> 10302.55s]  anymore. I'm not going to be like the guy with the sound board that makes fucking sound. Where do I
[10302.55s -> 10328.38s]  go? I have to get this open somehow. Be that guy, please. Live your dreams. Get off me. Hey, get away
[10328.38s -> 10366.52s]  from me. Nice gameplay. Don't play me. Oh, the little dog golem guys are here. Data. Now she's
[10366.52s -> 10390.20s]  drawn to me. Coveter. You are coveted. Okay. But does it have to be an anime convention? I feel
[10390.20s -> 10405.45s]  like that would be like if I was just sitting in my room and I smelled that I would want it.
[10405.45s -> 10408.97s]  Like if we get the doctor in the doctor's office and if I smelled pizza, I'm going to be like,
[10408.97s -> 10416.25s]  holy shit, doc, you got pizza in here? Yeah. Would you want a slice? Of course. Like it doesn't matter
[10416.25s -> 10432.89s]  where you are. Okay. Imagine you went for like just a routine checkup for the doctor and they came in
[10433.69s -> 10443.32s]  with like a little paper plate and a slice of pizza on it. And they were like, you want this?
[10443.88s -> 10451.35s]  I would eat it. I'd be like, all right, well, a doctor is giving this to me. I would definitely
[10451.35s -> 10456.06s]  eat it. Like if this was a random person on the street and they were just like, hey, you want a
[10456.06s -> 10460.06s]  slice of pizza? No, I don't know what the fuck you are. Get away from me. You're just a random
[10460.06s -> 10464.39s]  person. I don't know. You might be a doctor. I don't know. If a doctor is handing you a slice
[10464.39s -> 10471.53s]  of pizza, it's probably going to be okay. At least that's what I would think. He's already
[10471.53s -> 10481.10s]  examined it to make sure there's no, like nothing on it, nothing wrong with it. It's actually the
[10481.10s -> 10488.49s]  only way American doctors could administer. Wait, what? I didn't even say what you said.
[10488.49s -> 10504.62s]  All right. So how do I get in here? It has drugs in it. I just, what did I just turn on?
[10504.62s -> 10511.06s]  Something upstairs? I don't see a door over here. I hear lots of, I hear lots of mouth noises.
[10511.62s -> 10562.98s]  All right. I think it's up. It's just chat's mouth breathing. Not a big deal. We're fine. Get
[10562.98s -> 10575.51s]  away. It was sushi here at her. Now I want pizza. Oh yeah, guys. All right. Let's break this down.
[10576.33s -> 10580.84s]  Where am I? Where am I getting pizza from? Where should I get pizza from? What's like a pizza place
[10580.84s -> 10593.02s]  that you guys love? Get the whopper. I'll do that tomorrow. I promise I will do that tomorrow.
[10599.10s -> 10606.63s]  That's happening to on tomorrow's stream. I promise. What the hell are they doing to this guy?
[10607.35s -> 10650.68s]  That didn't kill you. How? This does not look comfortable. Um, that guy, his head just snaked
[10650.68s -> 10678.82s]  around. I don't think so. Get out of here. Oh, is he dead? Oh, that's not, that's bad. Oh, get
[10678.82s -> 10687.53s]  him down. I have to like blows. I have to blow them up. That didn't even work. Whatever. Okay.
[10687.53s -> 10717.43s]  Um, okay. So what do I do now? Just go up. Okay. Just order from a pizza place. It'll be 20 times
[10717.43s -> 10763.78s]  better than the main chains. I hear dog. Oh, don't run. What? They fucking good calzones water. What
[10763.78s -> 10767.94s]  is it? What is, what is water street pizzeria? Water street pizzeria. I don't even know what
[10767.94s -> 10776.09s]  that, what the fuck is that? They have really good council. I don't know what that is. Or please go
[10776.09s -> 10788.10s]  to Freddy Fazbear's. That's not a real place. I think they're chasing me down the stairs.
[10790.26s -> 10801.66s]  Nope. Chuck E cheese. I actually could go for a Chuck E cheese pizza right now. That's weird
[10801.66s -> 10805.18s]  for me to say, but I don't even care. People are like, Oh man, Chuck E cheese pizza. It's so gross.
[10805.18s -> 10809.02s]  You know, do you hear that they like take pizza from other pizzas and put it in making a new pizza
[10809.02s -> 10816.46s]  and serve it to you? I don't care. I don't even care. I'll just give me that one. I could eat a
[10816.46s -> 10838.74s]  Chuck E cheese pizza right now. The whole thing. Why am I on fire? What do a pizza eating stream?
[10838.74s -> 10842.74s]  I would, I would, I would cut it. I'd get like one of those big pizza knives and just go,
[10844.87s -> 10849.03s]  I would actually ask the restaurant. I'd say, Hey, can you make me a pizza? Don't cut it though.
[10849.03s -> 10855.02s]  I want to cut it. Just give me the big circle with just the cheese and everything. I want to
[10855.02s -> 10860.42s]  be the one to cut it because I want to have to go like and put my hand down on the knife and go
[10860.42s -> 10876.26s]  like down. That's what I want. I'm so hungry now. What do I do? Damn it. I'm so hungry. I'm going
[10876.26s -> 10887.99s]  to have to get a streamer snack. I'm going to have to get a streamer snack. Hey, I'm on here.
[10892.74s -> 10900.57s]  Get out of here. What are you doing? I need a streamer snack. I need one right now.
[10900.57s -> 10910.26s]  All right. I'm going to get a streamer snack. Everybody relax. That was weird. How did you open
[10910.26s -> 10923.74s]  the door? Where the fuck did you come from? Did you just drink a bunch of stuff? This is like in
[10923.74s -> 10937.51s]  gremlins when they're just drinking all the potions in the scientist room. Would you wink
[10937.51s -> 10949.11s]  for us for a streamer snack? No, I'm just going to get some food. I'll be back. All right. Streamer
[10949.11s -> 11149.70s]  snack time. I'll be right back. I got some really, really bad news. I don't have any more
[11150.92s -> 11165.48s]  jerky sticks. I got to eat. I got to eat almonds. I got to get more jerky sticks. It's like my
[11165.48s -> 11175.96s]  favorite. I'm just going to eat almonds until I can't breathe anymore. I'm going to fill my
[11175.96s -> 11187.05s]  body with almonds. It's not funny about almonds. They were the most calorically dense snack.
[11187.05s -> 11192.49s]  They got a good amount of protein. They've got a ton of calories and they're really good for you.
[11192.49s -> 11200.36s]  If you really want to get filled up, have some almonds. I just fucking dropped a bunch of them
[11200.36s -> 11215.24s]  all over the ground. God, it's not a good streamer snack though. Plus, this is such a bad streamer
[11215.24s -> 11223.19s]  snack. What was I thinking? These are wasabi and soy sauce almonds and they have a film on them
[11223.19s -> 11240.63s]  and it's going to get all over my hands. Look at it. It's already happening. They have this
[11240.63s -> 11251.78s]  Cheeto dust on them. I fucking hate when people watch me eat. I just picked up two of them and
[11251.78s -> 11258.04s]  now I can't even play the game anymore. I don't want to put my hands in my mouth because somebody
[11258.04s -> 11262.44s]  will clip it and they'll enhance it and they'll make it huge and they'll use it somewhere. I don't
[11262.44s -> 11272.95s]  want you to do that. Look, this is ridiculous. I just took another handful out. This is ridiculous.
[11272.95s -> 11292.30s]  That's ridiculous. It's all over my hands too. I need a strategy. What's the strategy here?
[11292.30s -> 11309.18s]  You didn't see that. Use a fork and knife? A fork and knife. A fork and Nike. Yeah, you hold it with
[11309.18s -> 11316.66s]  the fork and step on it and it'll grind it up and you can eat it. Hold on, give me a second.
[11316.66s -> 11341.98s]  Pour them into a cup. Wow, you're a fucking genius. Too late. Too late. Who goes over there?
[11341.98s -> 11369.08s]  Good dog. All right, one more handful and I'll play. You hear how crunchy these are? I don't want
[11369.08s -> 11384.57s]  it to pick up on the mic. I'm trying to make it not happen. Almonds taste like shit. What do you
[11384.57s -> 11394.90s]  think tastes good? If you don't like a roasted salted almond, what tastes good to you? If that
[11394.90s -> 11405.93s]  person writes, well, you know, acid, battery acid, oil, like car oil, dog food. Like, okay, well,
[11405.93s -> 11418.38s]  I get it. That's why almonds have cyanide in them. Good. How much cyanide are in these? How much
[11418.38s -> 11437.72s]  cyanide? Tell me. Tell me about the cyanide. Delicious cyanide. I feel not good.
[11537.46s -> 11569.05s]  Did you guys hear the crunch? Auto slug. I feel so much better. I just took in like 700 calories
[11569.05s -> 11588.79s]  in almonds. I may as well turn on fucking superpowers. No pizza? Later. It's already
[11588.79s -> 11648.84s]  fucking greasy on here. Where do I go? Can you make an Overwatch reference? Sure. I can't do
[11648.84s -> 11655.22s]  anything yet. All these bird seeds are gonna come out of my mouth and people are gonna be disgusted.
[11655.22s -> 11685.93s]  I can't do anything yet. I didn't even get a drink either. What a fucking amateur. I can't
[11685.93s -> 11697.29s]  shoot through like the chain link fence. Okay, that was delayed. Healing potion. Healing potion.
[11697.29s -> 11716.02s]  Get them. Look, it is desynced. I'm still eating these. It's taking forever. I promise I have teeth.
[11716.02s -> 11743.64s]  This is different. Boss fight. Boss fight. Washing his hand? Washing his hands with gloves on?
[11743.64s -> 11794.98s]  He just ate these almonds. I want a couple more. No, I can't talk. Almonds. Let's go. Look at this
[11794.98s -> 11822.38s]  paintball arena. I wonder what happens here. What are you gonna do? Nut tear list? I already did it.
[11822.38s -> 11828.34s]  All right. Here we go. Let's go. Fight. Fight. Fight. He's gonna show up. He's gonna
[11828.34s -> 11837.59s]  come down. Defeat the replica soldiers. Imagine seeing that when you open up the fucking thing.
[11848.68s -> 11857.13s]  Nut tear list. I already did one. I did it already. I think I put um... What was number one? I actually
[11857.13s -> 11881.26s]  don't remember. What did I put at number one? What was it? Ow. I have no grenades, huh?
[11881.98s -> 11902.84s]  It was boppities. Yeah, I know. I remember. I remember that. Boppities. So is he controlling
[11902.84s -> 11939.11s]  this? Is this the AI director? Oh boy. It's like a second delay. Actual delay. There's no delay.
[11941.85s -> 11949.08s]  I'm not an idiot. You can't pull a fast one on me. I'm sorry. It's not gonna work.
[11949.08s -> 11975.34s]  Show me the clip. Show it to me. Not that one. What was that? You just kicked me like...
[11976.06s -> 11991.46s]  What was that? You just kicked me like... What am I looking at here? What was that? You just
[11991.46s -> 12012.18s]  kicked me like... What was that? You just kicked me like... What was that? I don't get it. That was
[12012.18s -> 12034.89s]  matched up fine. There's nothing coming out of that one. What the fuck? When that thing fell,
[12034.89s -> 12038.41s]  was that somebody in there? It's like a guy in the porta potty and it tipped over.
[12039.91s -> 12043.35s]  Please help. It stinks in here. Get me out of the fucking porta potty.
[12044.15s -> 12052.81s]  No, it's one of those porta potties. It was at a goddamn outdoor live concert.
[12053.85s -> 12076.47s]  What's going on? Did I win? I won. Shoot and make a noise at the same time.
[12077.11s -> 12091.38s]  Oh. She's clipping that to me right now. Do it right now. I want to see it right now.

[12105.06s -> 12116.60s]  No, this is not even the right clip. I want to see the one I just did. Not scary. This is not it.

[12122.36s -> 12129.98s]  Webcam is delayed. Yeah. You would know. All right. So here we go. And if anybody talks...
[12129.98s -> 12134.78s]  After we watch this clip, if anybody talks about there being an audio delay,
[12134.78s -> 12149.59s]  you're going to get timed out for 200 days. Okay. I'm glad we have an understanding. Find out.
[12149.59s -> 12179.13s]  Let's find out. Shoot and make a noise at the same time.
[12189.24s -> 12201.62s]  It's fine. What's wrong with it? I don't see the issue. Okay. Wait. You're talking about my...
[12202.82s -> 12213.00s]  The FPS is a little slower. The video is not delayed. It's like a 20 FPS because the camera
[12213.00s -> 12231.13s]  sucks. Here. Ready? Let's see if I can fix this. I don't think you guys even really care either.
[12231.13s -> 12235.29s]  I feel like this is just a way to get me to stop playing the game and do something else
[12235.29s -> 12290.06s]  to like fucking burn time. How's this? That's better, right? Better. Fixed. It's just the FPS.
[12290.06s -> 12294.54s]  I turned the FPS up. I wanted to slow the FPS down because I got a 1080 and my 1080 sucks
[12294.54s -> 12299.42s]  and it's burning out. It smells like burning plastic in here. I know it doesn't. I'm kidding.
[12301.91s -> 12313.51s]  All right. Seeing the national anthem to prove it's fixed.
[12319.58s -> 12329.96s]  Oh, you joker. All right. Let's go. How do I leave? One of these open? Can I go down?
[12330.60s -> 12332.84s]  The one that fell over, right? Can I go down one of these?
[12333.72s -> 12346.54s]  Is there a door opener? Am I missing something? There we go. National anthem. Oh my god.
[12348.36s -> 12359.56s]  Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light What so proudly we hailed
[12360.36s -> 12368.44s]  At the twilight's last gleaming Whose broad stripes and bright stars
[12369.16s -> 12380.84s]  Through the perilous night O'er the ramparts we waved
[12381.80s -> 12391.80s]  At the twilight's last gleaming And its red glare
[12398.28s -> 12406.20s]  The bombs bursting in air Gave proof through the night
[12407.08s -> 12421.54s]  That our flag was still there. Oh, shit. Oh, say does that star
[12422.66s -> 12433.45s]  I have ADHD. I can't complete it. You know how hard it is to sing the national anthem

[12449.02s -> 12454.06s]  and there's like two major breaks in the national anthem that you think it's going to be when the
[12454.06s -> 12464.14s]  rocket's red glare but it's not that point yet and you get caught you're like oh there's another
