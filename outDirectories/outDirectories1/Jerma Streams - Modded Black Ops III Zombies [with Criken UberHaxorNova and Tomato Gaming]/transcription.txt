[1.21s -> 13.72s]  Hi guys, welcome to an Omega Lake stream. You were here earlier, I had to change a few things,
[13.72s -> 18.76s]  because we have some interesting things going on tonight. There's always something interesting
[18.76s -> 24.47s]  going on. There's always something, always something different, you know, always something
[24.47s -> 41.14s]  new going on here. Am I using a webcam, Mike? Am I? Hold on. Hello? Hello? Are we good?
[44.10s -> 50.97s]  What Mike was that? I don't know what Mike that was. Okay, well, anyways, hi. Welcome to
[50.97s -> 60.76s]  another edition. Go back. Oh, it was the VR Mike. How is it picking me up from all the way over
[60.76s -> 68.33s]  here? I have no idea. So let's go over a couple things. I'm not going to tweet this out yet.
[68.97s -> 73.34s]  I want to make sure that the stream is going to be stable, because I'm currently downloading
[75.80s -> 81.56s]  hundreds of gigabytes worth of data. And we'll explain it. We'll talk about it.
[82.28s -> 90.28s]  Somebody just gave speaking of hundreds, thinking of hundreds of gigabytes of data.
[97.19s -> 104.60s]  Somebody just give $200. That was German's massive dong for two,
[105.56s -> 113.22s]  $200, 20,000 bits. They're just given they're just given hundreds of dollars.
[114.42s -> 117.06s]  This this is just still happening right now, by the way, like this is another
[117.06s -> 125.62s]  hundred dollars just came in 300 bucks. This isn't I don't even know how to react. This is insane
[125.62s -> 131.53s]  to read. This is 300 bucks right at the beginning from German's massive dong. Well,
[133.58s -> 141.53s]  he gave it to himself. I didn't. I didn't. But thank you so much for the 300 fucking dollars.
[142.09s -> 145.85s]  They say I love you, Jeremy. You're the best been watching you since before the TF2
[145.85s -> 157.42s]  pyromaniac update. That's a long time ago. Thank you so much for your incredibly generous,
[157.42s -> 166.94s]  insane $300 30,000 bits. Thank you. But for what's going on today,
[168.49s -> 175.69s]  after that gigantic blast out of money. One night, why don't I tell you myself?
[176.89s -> 187.58s]  How you doing? Okay, anyways, so let me make sure one thing happens here.
[188.22s -> 199.45s]  Okay. Am I delayed? I might be. Did it again. Why did you do it again? That that's that's $400.
[200.41s -> 208.12s]  400 from German's massive dong. Okay, this is where it gets a little weird.
[208.68s -> 217.19s]  This is another one. They say take all of my money. Take it all. I don't want to take all
[217.19s -> 225.51s]  your money. I don't want to take all your money. That's 500 bucks. Take it all. Take
[225.51s -> 231.67s]  it all. I don't look I don't want to take it all. Why am I wearing a little boys t shirt?
[232.31s -> 237.75s]  This is a I like this shirt. It got stuck. It don't ever dry your shirts. Follow the directions
[237.75s -> 245.26s]  that are on the tag. Nobody ever does that. Why am I sweating? What is it? Why? How am I
[245.26s -> 252.04s]  sweating? What are you talking about? I'm not sweating. But German's massive dong give 500
[252.04s -> 258.92s]  bucks. That's so much money to see drop here in less than five minutes of the stream being
[258.92s -> 267.59s]  like that. That's $100 a minute. Yeah, that's a $100 a minute. I can't even fucking comprehend
[267.59s -> 277.30s]  it. That's a that's a thank you. That's a fucking ton of money. He's now Bill Gates,

[470.44s -> 474.04s]  or a bad stream. This might be a middle of the road stream. This might be a great stream.
[474.04s -> 488.87s]  I don't know. I can't. That's $750. That's outrageous. What was I saying? Oh yeah.

[565.61s -> 569.53s]  I'm not gonna play ads. Stop it. No, you don't have to give me this much money.
[570.09s -> 574.57s]  You don't have to. This is this is at the nine. I don't know what to do. This is
[574.65s -> 579.26s]  more money than I've ever seen in one sitting. I think what the fuck is happening. I just turned
[579.26s -> 584.30s]  the stream on. I'm like two and a half hours late. I haven't even explained to why I'm late.

[640.01s -> 645.85s]  German's massive dong and you're over $1,000 and I don't know why you do that. I don't
[645.85s -> 661.66s]  know what to do. This is insane. You don't have to give me all your money. That is
[662.38s -> 683.27s]  $1,005. No, $1,050, right? I forgot how to stream. I forgot how to stream.
[687.03s -> 693.16s]  I don't remember how to do this. Okay. So first of all, thanks for the thousand,

[773.42s -> 784.42s]  No, no, that's not what I meant. I mean, you'd be able to put out fires with that thing.
[785.22s -> 790.50s]  All right. Okay. Now I'm all fucked up. I don't know. I'm done. Just show us the dog.
[790.50s -> 797.66s]  Oh my God, dude. 12. I cannot fucking believe that I just got over $1,200 from the same
[797.66s -> 803.18s]  person. And then other people will cut like this is there. Okay, there you go. That's that's
[805.18s -> 809.90s]  $1,200 for 12. You do the math. I'm not I'm not one of those streamers. I'm not going to go
[809.90s -> 818.52s]  there. Okay. Anyways, my God, this is fucking ridiculous. German's massive dog. Thank you
[818.52s -> 828.01s]  for that. No, no, you didn't just do that. Why are you doing this? What's happening right
[828.01s -> 832.01s]  now? Why am I going to make this much money right now? I didn't even do anything.
[837.11s -> 845.22s]  Well, now I'm going to immediately order the wireless vibe set thing. Time to retire.
[845.22s -> 858.28s]  Holy shit. It's just a dream. Like wake up in my bed. But for real, though, like,
[858.84s -> 865.24s]  completely unnecessary. But thank you fucking so much for the insane uncountable dog money.
[866.20s -> 875.32s]  And that Peter P 337 are 100 bucks. He just said party. So fucking much. This is insanity.
[876.60s -> 886.07s]  Thank you. That's his name. That's the person's name. Anyways, this is what's happening today.
[886.07s -> 890.79s]  We're gonna hang out. I'm currently downloading a bunch of mods. Let's go over it. Let's go
[890.79s -> 895.03s]  over the week. We're just gonna hang out. We got like 40 minutes until, like I said,
[895.03s -> 901.59s]  Kraken Nova and tomato. We're gonna do something. And what that is, I'll tell you
[901.59s -> 913.78s]  after I collect myself. Yes, I had the title of the stream is already here. I'm off.
[913.78s -> 917.78s]  Anyways, okay, here we go. Let's get a sip of coffee. Let's fucking ground ourselves here.
[917.78s -> 941.03s]  Let me ground myself. Let me ground myself with like a clear quartz crystal. That's quartz.
[941.03s -> 951.34s]  It looks pretty. This is this is quartz. Let me ground myself. What's that supposed to do?
[952.06s -> 959.78s]  Why do I have that? Because I got Kim a ring the other day. No, no, not what you think.
[959.78s -> 964.82s]  Not what you're thinking. We just were like, we will. No, listen, I got, it was just
[964.82s -> 970.02s]  like a fun ring and like it was a crystal ring. And I was like, oh, it looked cool. Listen to me.
[970.02s -> 979.46s]  All right. Another hundred dollars just came in. No, we're not. Who are characters of these? Have
[979.46s -> 982.90s]  you ever seen them before? I don't know what these are. My stream is lagging. Too much
[982.90s -> 988.76s]  money has come in. Just kidding. The love never stops. Thank you, Jermis. Massive dong.
[991.18s -> 1006.14s]  But anyways, another 13 hundred five. Sometimes I think this isn't even real.
[1006.78s -> 1015.26s]  You know what I mean? I'm going to wake up in like a week or like a month or something.
[1015.26s -> 1019.58s]  And I'm going to be like 14 just in bed. And this is just a wild fucking like 10 year,
[1019.58s -> 1032.07s]  15 year long dream. You ever think about that? You are always, this is the, this is the,
[1032.07s -> 1037.27s]  this is the point of money where like you went over that, that threshold of like,
[1037.27s -> 1042.63s]  that's a lot. And then you went over it again. It's like the bar is here and it's just over
[1042.63s -> 1048.65s]  there and I can't, I can't see it anymore. It's 1400 dollars from Jermis massive dong.
[1049.45s -> 1059.86s]  I have to say it every time. Buy a ring here. Buy a ring with all my money. It wasn't an
[1059.86s -> 1063.86s]  expensive ring. It was just a fun thing for fun. We were looking around at some stores and
[1063.86s -> 1069.64s]  stuff. Turtle toenail. Another 50 dollars. Let's not forget about the other people that
[1069.64s -> 1072.76s]  have given more than 50 hundred dollars in the first 10. This was supposed to,
[1072.84s -> 1081.10s]  we are just kind of hanging out, I guess. My goodness gracious. No stream, just bits.
[1081.10s -> 1084.94s]  Been watching you for years. This is my first live stream. Well, welcome. Thanks for hanging
[1084.94s -> 1091.78s]  out. Eventually I will tell you what we're doing tonight. I bought her a candy ring. Yeah,
[1091.78s -> 1105.46s]  made it a candy. Twerk on stream. Why would I do that? But anyways, so we were going to
[1105.46s -> 1114.38s]  play. I got to reset. I can turn the stream off and turn it back on. Hold on. Let me
[1114.38s -> 1139.86s]  reset. I got to reset. I have to reset. Okay, we reset. Welcome to the stream, everybody.
[1142.58s -> 1147.86s]  No, he did it again. A streamer makes a million dollars doing that. You're not going
[1147.86s -> 1152.34s]  to give a million dollars. Do not fucking even think, don't even, I don't know if that's
[1152.34s -> 1160.01s]  real. You could be being a fucking weirdo. Though do not give a million dollars. I'm not
[1160.01s -> 1168.42s]  very good with money. Don't give it to me. Don't give it to me. It'll never work again.
[1173.72s -> 1177.64s]  I make a million dollars tonight and I'm like, well, all right. That was like fun for like
[1177.64s -> 1186.71s]  the last 10 years. I'm going to go live on a beach. I'm just going to just permanently
[1186.71s -> 1191.82s]  lie down in the sand and have like a beer right here. And I'm going to do it so often
[1191.82s -> 1196.70s]  that I'm going to have like a permanent sunburn, vacation beer sunburn here. It's
[1196.70s -> 1214.28s]  going to be like a tattoo. I was going to tell you what we were doing today.
[1214.36s -> 1242.87s]  What am I supposed to do? Dude, what the fuck are you doing? That's $1,600. What did
[1242.87s -> 1269.22s]  you say? You best stream for the rest of your life until you die. I can't stream
[1269.22s -> 1273.62s]  anymore. Is this what happens? Is this what happens when you get like too much money?
[1273.62s -> 1287.66s]  You're just like, um, so what we're going to, hey, what we're going to do today,
[1287.66s -> 1293.86s]  let me tell you, it's really cool stuff that what's going on. Uh, so what we're

[1314.97s -> 1321.19s]  know that I'm taking a little vacation next week. One bit equals minus one brain cell.
[1323.18s -> 1327.66s]  Okay. Give, look, give me, give me a little credit here. So I'm just sitting here in my office,

[1333.35s -> 1339.56s]  started. Hey guys, welcome. Somebody opens the door and they have a briefcase. And I don't,

[1379.66s -> 1382.62s]  briefcase. Five minutes later, there's another a hundred dollar bill of it.
[1382.62s -> 1391.21s]  He does that 16 times and he walks in every time he goes like,
[1391.93s -> 1403.27s]  and it's like, yeah, like a German's dick. Oh my God. All right. That they said, this is

[1408.09s -> 1410.89s]  your videos and streams got me through some hard times that I could never gotten
[1410.89s -> 1414.25s]  through without you. Just want to say thank you for being used so much. Love a fellow
[1414.25s -> 1426.10s]  gamer. That's, that's all you needed to say. Seriously. That's it. You don't have to give
[1426.10s -> 1433.11s]  me fucking 1700 bucks, but that's a, that money will be spent on candy. I buy a lot of
[1433.11s -> 1438.23s]  chocolates. I buy a lot of Reese's. Uh, but for real, that's so much fucking money.
[1439.03s -> 1445.38s]  I, I have nothing else to say besides I am fucking forever grateful that you would
[1445.38s -> 1450.10s]  even consider even thinking for a second that some random guy on the internet deserves
[1450.10s -> 1453.30s]  almost $2,000 of your money and I can't even fucking comprehend it.
[1454.42s -> 1459.35s]  Thank you so much for being part of the community. That's, that's fucking intense,
[1459.35s -> 1466.20s]  man. Like I, I really, really hope that you can afford it. Number one. And I'm just glad that
[1466.20s -> 1475.03s]  you have fun here. That's all I care about. So I will put that money to good use. You just,
[1475.03s -> 1482.74s]  you just yourself pretty much bought like the dunk tank spring. Yeah. There it is. Like
[1482.74s -> 1493.93s]  seriously, uh, moving on from that though, I, I'm forever grateful. Thank you. Oh yeah,
[1493.93s -> 1497.29s]  that's right. I thought I didn't like talk about that yet. I talked about a little bit
[1497.29s -> 1502.57s]  at the end of the stream. Uh, you'll see it whenever someday. But anyways, um, after that
[1502.57s -> 1515.94s]  monumental amount of fucking money, what we're doing today. Hey, how are you talking to you?
[1515.94s -> 1522.54s]  How you been? He's going to say it. He's finally going to say it. He's going to tell
[1522.54s -> 1530.39s]  us what we're doing today is I originally planned. So we were VR last night. I wanted
[1530.39s -> 1536.98s]  today to be kind of a chill stream. So around like, I don't know, three o'clock,
[1536.98s -> 1543.67s]  I was going to just play, um, what's that video game Western? Call of Juarez, right? We're
[1543.67s -> 1554.14s]  going to play Call of Juarez. We're going to play Call of Juarez. But it turned out that,
[1554.14s -> 1559.88s]  uh, Criken sent me a message and he said, Hey, we've got some shit going on. If you want
[1559.88s -> 1563.93s]  to play, we're going to do like black ops, three zombies modded. And I was like,
[1565.29s -> 1570.65s]  all right, that sounds like fun, but they don't start streaming till like 20, 30
[1570.65s -> 1574.87s]  minutes from now. So what I kind of had to push the stream back a little bit.
[1574.87s -> 1578.79s]  It was like kind of last minute, not even like 24 hours, really 12 hours or so.
[1579.59s -> 1585.67s]  So I thought it'd be fun. We're going to do extreme modded black ops three.
[1585.67s -> 1604.62s]  There's like 50 mods, Jervis dong is average. Why people are given more.
[1605.58s -> 1613.11s]  So before I address the more penis money that came in the dong money that came in,
[1628.25s -> 1634.39s]  this is like surgeon income right now. Do you understand? This is like, I should be
[1634.39s -> 1648.73s]  performing like a heart surgery. I've lost. Okay, hold on. But listen, so yesterday VR,
[1648.73s -> 1651.45s]  I was going to chill a little bit today, but we're going to do another high octane
[1651.45s -> 1657.35s]  stream today. Crazy black ops three modded nonsense. It was like a hundred and 200,
[1657.35s -> 1659.59s]  300 gigs worth of stuff. I can't, I don't know what the fuck it's going to be. It's
[1659.59s -> 1662.63s]  going to be insane. That's happening very soon. We're just going to hang out till then
[1662.63s -> 1666.71s]  tomorrow. Carl Juarez might beat the whole game. I don't know. Might not might
[1666.71s -> 1671.27s]  give up halfway through. It might be the whole thing Friday. That's right. Going four days in
[1671.27s -> 1675.67s]  a row, four days in a row of streams here. Friday after like six o'clock. Cause I have,
[1675.67s -> 1681.72s]  I've got an appointment that I have to do. So Friday at like five, six plus o'clock,
[1681.72s -> 1687.00s]  just going to turn it off and we're going to hang out and have fun about appointment.
[1688.98s -> 1694.62s]  So we're going to do four days in a row because after Friday, I'm going to be gone
[1694.62s -> 1708.14s]  for a little under a week. My mother's coming in, you know, got to hang out with my mother.
[1708.14s -> 1716.10s]  It's been like seven months, which Carl Juarez gunslinger tried to play it a long time ago
[1716.10s -> 1726.34s]  and it just didn't work out, but I will be gone from Saturday ish all the way through
[1726.34s -> 1732.02s]  into like potentially Thursday, like Wednesday to Thursday depending. So I'll be gone for
[1732.02s -> 1738.33s]  about five days straight. Give or take. I'll let you know. He still hasn't started to
[1738.33s -> 1743.70s]  play the game. I have to wait. I have to wait for criken and Nova. They don't start for like
[1743.70s -> 1748.71s]  another 20 minutes. So we're just hanging out to begin with. Why is this so laggy?
[1749.35s -> 1763.05s]  You see that? It shouldn't be laggy like this. There we go. Okay.
[1764.46s -> 1767.99s]  I think we were going to set up a little. I have everything installed now.
[1768.63s -> 1773.54s]  Let me just get in there and see if it worked. Dude, they're already playing it.
[1777.11s -> 1783.18s]  Imagine if they like, like the lie to me. Imagine they're like, yeah, they get it.
[1783.18s -> 1786.62s]  It's like a bunch of, it's a bunch of gigs and I'm like, oh yeah,
[1786.62s -> 1789.26s]  gigs and I download all this shit and they just like stop playing without me
[1790.15s -> 1798.07s]  and they just pretend I'm like not here, but we had before I'm going to open up the game.
[1798.07s -> 1801.11s]  I'm sorry, but I'm kind of stalling and a lot of money came in and
[1803.40s -> 1808.20s]  you guys are fucking too much. Thank you. Turtle toenail $50. Stop talking about the
[1808.20s -> 1816.20s]  stream. What? Dermis dong is average. Thank you Magellan. Thanks for the $50.
[1816.20s -> 1819.08s]  Fine. You got me take my money for real though. Forever grateful for your content
[1819.08s -> 1824.47s]  and we'll forever will be. I'm forever grateful for the fact that you're watching and you're
[1824.47s -> 1830.65s]  here. So I, you guys have made my literally my dreams of like when I was 12 come true.
[1830.65s -> 1835.48s]  So thank you for that. That the counter is all fucked up. It's going to be broken for like
[1835.48s -> 1841.43s]  the next 30 minutes. Everything I've ever wanted to do in my life. It's like what I,
[1841.43s -> 1844.47s]  what you guys are fulfilling that dream. So I have you to thank for that one.
[1847.59s -> 1853.85s]  But let's open it up. Let me get out of here. Let me open up black ops.
[1854.41s -> 1859.59s]  I haven't never even played this before guys. I don't even know how to play zombies.
[1859.59s -> 1864.98s]  This is, I'm going to be such a piece of crap to stream. I've never played a game of zombies in
[1864.98s -> 1883.69s]  my life, but thank you so much again to Dermis massive dong. You are too fucking generous.
[1884.33s -> 1895.61s]  All right. Let's open this up. Black ops three might be loud. Hope it's not loud.
[1895.61s -> 1899.26s]  Yeah. They're going to have to give me like a crash course in this game.
[1899.26s -> 1905.22s]  Cause I have no idea how to play it. Play online multiplayer to warm up.
[1905.22s -> 1914.52s]  I think Kraken is in like the streaming channel. I wonder what that means.
[1917.06s -> 1928.31s]  Imagine thanking your own dong. I know it's weird. Yeah. But how could I warm up?
[1928.31s -> 1931.19s]  No, does anybody play black ops? I thought there was like a joke.
[1931.99s -> 1946.33s]  No, I don't. How do I turn off the discord overlay? There we go.
[1946.33s -> 1949.45s]  Yeah. Wasn't there a meme before that like only like eight people had this on PC or
[1949.45s -> 1960.89s]  something. I hear this. Why would this be coming through my Ben Q monitor? What the fuck?
[1962.82s -> 1966.82s]  We saw that you had a Ben Q monitor plugged in. You wanted to come through the non-speakers.
[1967.46s -> 1983.30s]  There we go. So let's get this captured. It's a PC game. That sure is. Hey, there we go. Look at
[1983.30s -> 1992.42s]  that. Hey, do you want to open the store? Oh, Kraken. There is this Kraken. Hey, Kraken,
[1992.42s -> 1998.50s]  Kraken, can you hear me? Kraken. Oh, you can't hear me. Oh no. He has AirPods in. Kraken.
[1998.50s -> 2009.66s]  I hope I downloaded all this shit right. It wasn't three. It was way more than three.
[2010.30s -> 2026.76s]  Hold on a second. Wait a second. Wait a minute. Hold on. It was like 50.
[2028.34s -> 2032.82s]  Why are you just downloading? No, no, I have, I should have them all. I downloaded them. Dude,
[2032.82s -> 2038.23s]  it took like two hours to download all these. What was that? It was just fucking.
[2039.19s -> 2054.74s]  Maps only show up in zombies. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. That's the default sound. I'm such
[2054.74s -> 2061.32s]  a bad streamer. Is there any way I can make sure that I'm like subscribed to these? Let me see.
[2061.96s -> 2067.67s]  It says I'm subscribed to all of them. Should I go? Is Kraken streaming right now?
[2068.23s -> 2073.14s]  Yeah, it says I have them all. All right. I think I just panicked for no reason.
[2080.92s -> 2094.54s]  The first 35 minutes of the stream. My God. All right. Here we go. Let me get my
[2094.62s -> 2108.95s]  settings correct. Should be starting very soon here. Stop giving yourselves a bunch of donations.
[2111.34s -> 2117.38s]  Treyarch. I'm surprised I actually have Call of Duty installed.
[2122.90s -> 2135.46s]  Re-chat. Re-chat. I'm trying to set up a video game. 2015? Oh, that's right. They make,
[2135.46s -> 2138.42s]  they made so many of these that I forget that they come out like every eight months.
[2139.06s -> 2145.53s]  Okay. Let's go to, I want to chat. Party privacy. I don't know what the fuck that means.
[2146.09s -> 2166.17s]  Oh, where's this? Where's this settings? Oh, oh, that, oh, all right. Is there a settings?
[2168.79s -> 2180.62s]  Media options. What, what kind of menu is this? Did enough $50 come in? Multiplayer. All right.
[2180.62s -> 2186.50s]  I'm going to, let's get this down a little. Voice volume. It looks good. I can turn this
[2186.50s -> 2191.30s]  up. I want to turn, let me, cinematics. Somebody wants to hear that. Subtitles on.
[2192.26s -> 2200.62s]  Multiplayer music. Multiplayer dialogue. That's because it's Xbox. Okay. Graphics.
[2201.50s -> 2209.18s]  Yeah, this is what I want. Windowed full screen. Yeah. RGB. Field of view. Excuse me.
[2209.90s -> 2215.56s]  How dare you make that default at 80. Max frame to second. Sync every frame. That's
[2215.56s -> 2229.05s]  not what I want, right? Okay. That's better. Subtitles still off. That's all right.
[2229.05s -> 2237.53s]  All right. Extra quality. Stop the bits. No, this is, okay, look, I'll do this.
[2239.45s -> 2245.51s]  Those are all late coming in. You can tell the money's just going right to his fucking head.
[2246.84s -> 2262.84s]  Game player name. What? What? Full name. I don't want the people's full names.
[2263.40s -> 2273.34s]  It's your player name. Oh, okay. All right. I think, I think I'm ready to,
[2274.14s -> 2278.15s]  I think I'm ready to go. Should I go in here and just scream at Kraigen?
[2278.71s -> 2288.26s]  Turn off motion blur. Oh, yeah, that's right. Off. Disabled. Ambient occlusion. I don't think so.
[2289.90s -> 2293.26s]  Dynamic shadow of this. Some of these are dumb, right? Which one of these is the dumb one?
[2293.98s -> 2307.42s]  I know there's at least two or three dumb ones. Extra? No, this is dumb. I don't want
[2307.42s -> 2311.50s]  any of these to be on it like that high because we're doing fucked up mods. They're
[2311.50s -> 2322.98s]  going to run like shit. AO is the dumb one. Oh, okay. All right. Let's see if I fucking
[2322.98s -> 2326.02s]  get in here and see what he says. All right. Let's see if we can pull them in.
[2331.93s -> 2343.51s]  Hello. Hello. Hey. Hey, how are you? Hey, how are you, man?
[2344.79s -> 2348.07s]  This is the, so everyone in here is currently screaming? This is the waiting room. Yeah. I'm
[2348.07s -> 2352.07s]  actually about to deafen, but uh. Oh, okay. Cool. Hey, yeah. This is the, this is the place
[2352.07s -> 2358.02s]  to be. Yeah. I'm live right now. I'll be back in like, oh, oh, say something, say,
[2358.02s -> 2366.68s]  quit, say something, say something. I'm fucking alone. That was tomato, by the way. All right.
[2366.68s -> 2372.22s]  So just, it's just me in here. Nope. Don't go into the auto chest room. What? All right. Here
[2372.22s -> 2390.52s]  we go. All right. So I said I was streaming and I scared him. All right. So what can I,
[2390.52s -> 2402.65s]  what can I do? How do, what do I do? What do I do? I've just set up, I gotta get camera,
[2402.65s -> 2410.95s]  put the camera back on. Everyone loves a cam, right? I'm not going to play the campaign.
[2419.96s -> 2428.41s]  Spend my COD points? I have 200. What does that get me? What? This is a Captain America
[2428.41s -> 2445.54s]  t-shirt, guys. What are you talking about? Home Star Runner. It could be that too.
[2446.10s -> 2458.20s]  We're going to get started real soon here. What the fuck? Open a loot crate? No,
[2458.20s -> 2461.48s]  because I don't want you guys, wasn't there a thing where if you opened up a loot crate,
[2462.20s -> 2465.08s]  somebody else could watch you opening loot crates? Was that this game or was that a
[2465.08s -> 2483.61s]  different one? Dong's account is gone? Oh Jesus. Well, I, I, I don't know what to say. I don't
[2483.61s -> 2492.46s]  know what to do. I guess we'll just see how that plays out. But I snapped him. No, I didn't.
[2503.75s -> 2507.91s]  Well, I don't know what happened to that, but I, I don't have much else to say, you know,
[2507.91s -> 2518.98s]  that it was fucking an insane amount of money. Kraken's playing? I'm in the streaming
[2518.98s -> 2522.34s]  channel right now with Kraken and he's muted and he's deafened. He's doing an introduction.
[2523.48s -> 2526.92s]  That's what I've been doing. This is just the guys. This is the introduction. This is my
[2526.92s -> 2554.63s]  43 minute introduction. Fix my sleeve. Where? What? What is wrong with you guys? What? What?
[2556.65s -> 2570.86s]  Fix your, what the fuck? Like that is like tiny sleeves. I know this is like a look.
[2570.86s -> 2574.50s]  You want to see how you make yourself look like a baby? Ready? Like I got like big
[2574.50s -> 2583.06s]  fucking shoulders, right? Kraken sent you the collection, right? Yeah. I got it all
[2583.06s -> 2590.90s]  downloaded, all installed. I hope it was 800 gigabytes. I'm going to assume. It was insane.
[2590.90s -> 2597.54s]  I couldn't believe it. Every, almost every map in that thing is worth about two gigs a pop.
[2598.87s -> 2604.39s]  I don't know why. Dude, it was like, I was telling my chat earlier before he started,
[2604.39s -> 2608.23s]  it was like I was taking buckets of water and like dumping them out of a sinking ship.
[2608.23s -> 2613.59s]  I had to, I was just uninstalling things as it was going. Yeah. That's I mean, think about
[2613.59s -> 2618.79s]  like this. I've had this shit on my computer for probably like the last two weeks when we've been
[2618.79s -> 2624.47s]  planning on doing this again. So I've been watching this like tumor on my drive just getting
[2624.47s -> 2629.83s]  bigger and bigger. Oh my God. It's going to be insane when it's all removed. Yeah. I mean,
[2629.83s -> 2633.03s]  honestly, half the stuff, I never cleaned up this collection from the last time we did it
[2633.03s -> 2638.07s]  because we never got through all of it. Yeah. So like there's like, it's like 50% trash and
[2638.07s -> 2643.35s]  other 50% like actual levels and about 50% of that is stuff we've already done. So it's actually
[2643.35s -> 2647.11s]  just like, all right. So how do I know if I have this installed correctly? Cause it's,
[2647.91s -> 2653.99s]  is there with me to like see it? Yeah. If you're on zombies, hang on. I'm logging in
[2653.99s -> 2657.59s]  as well. The easiest way is just to like join, like go into the game personally, like
[2657.59s -> 2662.79s]  a private zombies level. Okay. So like private game. Yeah. And just grab like Minecraft or
[2662.87s -> 2671.91s]  something, man. All right. So like change map. Yeah. Okay. I see like star wars, Minecraft,
[2671.91s -> 2679.75s]  just grab one song. Hey, don't look too much. Wait, what the fuck are these? Don't. Hey.
[2679.75s -> 2686.73s]  All right. Just grab one. This 70 files here. Hey, all right. Just grab one, launch it up
[2686.73s -> 2691.77s]  and see if you like what you see or if at least what did it? Oh my God. All right. I'm
[2691.77s -> 2695.77s]  going to try. I'm going to try to launch. You said Minecraft. I'm going to just see
[2695.77s -> 2705.50s]  if it launches. Get a Minecraft one. We're probably going to start with monopoly again,
[2705.50s -> 2710.54s]  though. Why did your voice do that? Huh? I forgot. It's a, it's a, it's an
[2710.54s -> 2713.74s]  Activision game. It just makes everybody's voice a thousand times louder. Doesn't it?
[2713.74s -> 2725.22s]  Oh fuck. Wait, did I do that? Was it you? Wait, was it me or you? Hello. Hey. Hey,
[2725.86s -> 2731.14s]  there's the guy. How you been? I've been great. How are you? I'm doing great. Sorry.
[2731.30s -> 2735.14s]  Wait in here in this room for a bit. Are you okay? No, we're good. We're good.
[2735.14s -> 2740.34s]  I'm just hanging out. Just being a weirdo. Yeah. My microphone. Oh God, it does.
[2740.34s -> 2746.02s]  Craig, you gotta be careful. It does things. Oh, it boosts your mic. Yep. Oh yeah. I just
[2746.02s -> 2750.58s]  watched it. I watched it at normal volume. The second I unmuted to tell you guys that
[2750.58s -> 2755.86s]  it didn't boost, it boosted to 100. So I remember. Yeah. Okay. So, uh,
[2756.82s -> 2759.62s]  Jermo, would you prefer me to call you Jeremy or Jermo? I don't want to.
[2761.14s -> 2764.18s]  You can call me anything you want. Anything you want. All right. As long as it's, it's,
[2764.18s -> 2769.14s]  it's makes sense. Germ town. How about that? Yeah, that's good. So I'll get the map. The
[2769.14s -> 2773.94s]  map works. Cool. Well, which map? Oh, you guys are testing out one. I just had him,
[2773.94s -> 2778.34s]  I just had him pick a random one from the collection because we can assume as long as,
[2778.34s -> 2782.26s]  as long as his drive wasn't full when he tried to install it. I mean, we'll see,
[2782.26s -> 2787.46s]  because it sounds like you're deleting as I was doing that. I was deleting as I was coming in.
[2788.02s -> 2791.54s]  I've been like laying down the tracks. It was like 10 gigs a second. It was like,
[2791.54s -> 2796.34s]  I mean, I bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. I was doing a Jerma, but like the issue is that I
[2796.34s -> 2799.54s]  didn't go through the collection Kraken from last time to get rid of the stuff that we did
[2799.54s -> 2803.62s]  and wouldn't go back to. So it's all just like still. Yeah, it's all just this messy.
[2803.62s -> 2807.22s]  At this point, I mean, we forgot most of the shit we did last time. So I'll probably
[2807.22s -> 2810.82s]  just like grab like stuff that still looks interesting or shit. And we'll skip the shit
[2810.82s -> 2819.18s]  that I know was complete irrevocable garbage, you know, the pseudo voodoo one was never going
[2819.18s -> 2823.74s]  to play that. No, yeah, that one was fucked, dude. I couldn't find another one that was like
[2823.74s -> 2828.14s]  that. Like that was really their Pokemon that you're better zombies. There's there's nothing
[2828.14s -> 2831.26s]  else. No, there's definitely some weird ones. I went, I did like a little,
[2831.26s -> 2834.14s]  there's one where you fight against rats and I think you're supposed to be cats. I think
[2834.14s -> 2839.34s]  I got that one. OK, there's one like TOS violations in this, like 70.
[2840.70s -> 2846.54s]  Well, there's a game of Thrones one because I had to. Oh, yeah. Oh, that's topical, dude.
[2846.54s -> 2851.99s]  That's gonna be great. I know exactly who do you think I am? Yeah, we're you know,
[2852.55s -> 2855.51s]  we're all about the clickbait here. We're just trying to capitalize on those trends.
[2856.65s -> 2861.61s]  Months. Why we're playing this Black Ops 3. I was surprised with Black Ops 3.
[2861.77s -> 2866.25s]  Didn't Black Ops like seven come out like last week? Yeah, but this is for some reason,
[2866.25s -> 2872.89s]  we're all surprised to manage to con you into joining. Yeah, it was literally like just like
[2873.69s -> 2878.42s]  today. It was just like, do you want to do this? And I'm like, yeah, yeah.
[2878.42s -> 2883.14s]  Yeah, I'll spend 60 bucks on Black Ops 3. Every other person we messaged to play this
[2883.14s -> 2889.21s]  actually like, yeah, everyone else said no. So thank you guys for there's no, you know,
[2889.21s -> 2892.09s]  there's no reason for that. You'll have a great time. I'll tell you that much.
[2892.17s -> 2896.89s]  Let's see. Well, we'll make it fun. That'll be fun. Have you what? Have you met James,
[2896.89s -> 2903.08s]  by the way, over half Xenova? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Hello. Welcome. Sorry, I was muted.
[2906.17s -> 2911.51s]  Where's this bit? It's a bit. What happened to you, buddy? What do you mean? Are you on
[2911.51s -> 2918.12s]  pain meds or something? This is my voice. I'm fucked up. It's a little weird and loud. No.
[2919.08s -> 2927.64s]  Ah, hold on one sec. No, is it? No, it's definitely addressed. Why is it pitched up?
[2931.30s -> 2934.50s]  All right. I'm like having to like on the fly change everyone's audio levels.
[2934.50s -> 2937.86s]  They're fucking. Yeah, everyone. When you turn on Black Ops, like have your
[2937.86s -> 2942.42s]  microphone properties open this whole stream. Oh, yeah. Fun, fun bit. Some of these maps
[2942.42s -> 2946.42s]  will crash you not for any of our fault, but just because they're bad. And when that
[2946.42s -> 2952.50s]  happens, the game will auto boost your mic to 100 again. So it's like an added fucking
[2952.50s -> 2958.34s]  slap in the face. Also, full disclosure to cover my own ass. I personally don't have the time to
[2958.34s -> 2964.34s]  vet all these levels. So whatever we see in there is basically the extent of me scrolling
[2964.34s -> 2968.66s]  to the comments and seeing if anyone yelled, holy shit, how'd this get on? Yeah. So, yeah.
[2970.55s -> 2974.39s]  A button prepared for this one. I'm going to get a little bit of a scene change,
[2974.79s -> 2979.77s]  ready for this. Last time wasn't so bad. We played Monopoly. We played Minecraft.
[2980.65s -> 2982.41s]  Is it working now? Oh, you're great.
[2985.54s -> 2992.92s]  Except for the. Oh, Jesus. What? What's going on, man? What did you do to your mixer?
[2992.92s -> 2995.96s]  I don't know. What's wrong with it? You're fucking 13.
[2997.94s -> 3002.90s]  This is this is. It started. It's not a bit. What's wrong with my voice? Dude,
[3002.90s -> 3009.14s]  I've heard you in real life. This is not your voice. What's it? That laugh was on the fly.
[3009.94s -> 3013.54s]  What kind of computer you have hooked up? Yeah. I don't know how that computer works.
[3013.54s -> 3017.86s]  Wait, can you guys still hear me? Yes. Oh, my God. It's discord, dude.
[3017.86s -> 3023.11s]  I closed discord, but it's still up. It's like a ghost. Oh, God. Yeah.
[3023.11s -> 3029.51s]  I don't recognize this person. It's really, it's fucking me up. By the way, I sent you guys
[3029.51s -> 3035.43s]  a squad invite, the new Twitch squad. Why don't you do that? Oh, wait. Oh, yeah. Does that work?
[3036.15s -> 3040.15s]  Oh, no, no. I tried the other day. Actually, this does it. Let's try it.
[3042.42s -> 3046.73s]  So is there there's a squat. Oh, I see invite to the squad.
[3046.73s -> 3050.65s]  And then people can, you know, watch all the chats and watch all the perspectives.
[3050.65s -> 3055.77s]  And it's meant to be like a big happy family. I just hurt my mouth. How?
[3057.85s -> 3060.25s]  You invited me and I clicked on it. It hurt my fucking mouth.
[3061.21s -> 3064.01s]  I'm sorry. No, I just like I opened my jaw really fast.
[3064.57s -> 3067.29s]  It was too bad because you're excited about the invite or what?
[3067.29s -> 3070.65s]  Yeah, I just saw the invite. I like I pogged myself to death.
[3073.10s -> 3074.62s]  We can't hear James anymore. So if he's
[3076.20s -> 3081.08s]  having the one time with spoon. What the fuck? Hello? Yeah.
[3081.08s -> 3085.64s]  How are you still in the call? Is it good? No. What the fuck, dude?
[3086.20s -> 3091.56s]  I think it's starting to grow on me, though. Yeah, I kind of like this new James.
[3092.60s -> 3096.04s]  It's getting worse. I don't know how to say it.
[3096.04s -> 3098.36s]  It's definitely getting worse by the minute. It's getting higher.
[3099.83s -> 3103.03s]  Like a high wine. Oh, he's gone. All right.
[3103.03s -> 3105.43s]  Hopefully he's fixed it. This is fucking hilarious.
[3105.43s -> 3108.71s]  OK, so we get like in a team or something. Yeah, I'm making a lot.
[3108.71s -> 3112.55s]  Let's get in it. Let's get in the team. Do you ever play Black Ops 3?
[3112.55s -> 3115.11s]  Never. I've never even opened it. I don't even know how to play zombies.
[3115.11s -> 3118.71s]  I've never even opened it. Oh, great. All right, cool.
[3118.71s -> 3121.11s]  I played like the original Black Ops. I don't think I ever played
[3122.39s -> 3124.31s]  until we did this like a couple of months ago.
[3125.19s -> 3128.95s]  Yeah, another saw map by that tomato because that was that was inspired.
[3128.95s -> 3131.59s]  Yeah, we can grab them. You know how like those people
[3131.59s -> 3133.35s]  like didn't respond or they didn't want to do it.
[3133.35s -> 3136.63s]  And like I did. I probably should have been one of those people that said no,
[3136.63s -> 3139.43s]  because I've never played zombies before in my life.
[3140.71s -> 3143.03s]  Oh, God. I know the basics.
[3143.03s -> 3145.99s]  Run in a circle and a crowd of people run behind you.
[3145.99s -> 3149.80s]  Yeah. Except, yeah, that's it. I figured it out.
[3150.60s -> 3153.08s]  Some of the some of these maps also have additional objectives.
[3153.08s -> 3158.68s]  Like I think one had us in Minecraft forge a diamond sword,
[3158.68s -> 3160.20s]  which would let us progress in the level.
[3162.30s -> 3169.94s]  We had one I saw was Black Ops for you where so it's like I guess there's many games.
[3169.94s -> 3172.74s]  I don't really know how that's going to work, but this is going to be so odd.
[3173.54s -> 3175.22s]  Yeah, no, we don't know what we're getting into.
[3175.22s -> 3178.66s]  That's the whole that's the whole point. It's like it's like through let wheel.
[3179.30s -> 3182.04s]  Cool. Oh, my God.
[3182.04s -> 3186.28s]  I opened up my my Black Ops mod folder and it's this barren wasteland
[3186.28s -> 3189.56s]  because the folder is somehow full even though it's not.
[3189.56s -> 3191.00s]  Craig, you might have to do the first level without me.
[3192.68s -> 3195.48s]  All right. Are we going to invite you?
[3195.48s -> 3198.28s]  I do like I'll give you the name of one of them.
[3198.28s -> 3200.68s]  OK. Hello. You sound good now.
[3200.68s -> 3204.34s]  I'm good. No, no, no.
[3204.34s -> 3207.46s]  No, no. Are you serious?
[3207.46s -> 3210.18s]  It's you started all right. And then it was like, no.
[3210.18s -> 3213.35s]  Yeah. What the fuck is weird?
[3213.35s -> 3217.67s]  I was I was told to like deactivate my mic before and that should have fixed it.
[3217.67s -> 3219.99s]  This is crazy. Other people have had this before.
[3219.99s -> 3222.31s]  I don't know how they fixed it. This is totally intentional.
[3222.31s -> 3224.47s]  I can't I can't believe it's not intentional.
[3225.53s -> 3228.25s]  Now it's getting a little bit to the length where it can't be intentional.
[3229.05s -> 3230.57s]  Any better? Or is it still the same?
[3230.57s -> 3231.77s]  There it is. Oh, here.
[3232.81s -> 3235.18s]  Yeah. Yeah, you're fixed.
[3235.18s -> 3236.14s]  Legit. Yeah.
[3236.14s -> 3237.50s]  Yeah, you sound good. Great.
[3237.50s -> 3240.86s]  All I did was disable it and re enable it again.
[3240.86s -> 3242.22s]  Well, there you go. That's all it takes.
[3242.22s -> 3244.78s]  That's why turning it off and turning it back on.
[3244.78s -> 3246.86s]  Oh, yeah, dude. That's what I said.
[3246.86s -> 3249.26s]  Unplug and plug it back in.
[3249.26s -> 3250.62s]  Hot take one bikini bottom.
[3250.62s -> 3253.26s]  A spongebob zombies want cheese cube three.
[3253.26s -> 3253.82s]  Do you want dead?
[3253.82s -> 3255.98s]  Dude, how many fucking maps did you make me download?
[3255.98s -> 3260.06s]  There was it took me like two hours to fucking go over.
[3260.06s -> 3261.82s]  Yeah. Do you want Cobra Kai?
[3261.82s -> 3262.78s]  Do you want farm?
[3263.34s -> 3265.50s]  Do you want to see? I told you guys.
[3266.06s -> 3266.70s]  Minecraft.
[3266.70s -> 3269.02s]  I told everybody that last time I was making it up.
[3269.74s -> 3271.34s]  I picked multiple Minecraft levels.
[3272.86s -> 3275.50s]  I grabbed a lot because I knew I knew this might happen.
[3275.50s -> 3279.58s]  OK, this one's called Minecraft, like the fucking German like nine.
[3279.58s -> 3280.94s]  Oh, yeah, try that one.
[3280.94s -> 3281.58s]  That looks bad.
[3282.54s -> 3284.86s]  I mean, I told you I didn't vet any of these, but sure.
[3284.86s -> 3286.22s]  Yeah, let's hope this is good.
[3286.22s -> 3288.86s]  Get your get your get your scene change ready for real.
[3289.82s -> 3292.62s]  And wait, what do I have to do?
[3292.62s -> 3293.82s]  Why do I have to do that?
[3294.20s -> 3296.12s]  Do we have to like cut the black screen or something?
[3296.12s -> 3297.24s]  I didn't hear you guys.
[3297.24s -> 3299.88s]  No, I don't think it's ever going to get to that level.
[3299.88s -> 3301.96s]  It probably won't be to us.
[3301.96s -> 3303.80s]  I can't imagine any of those.
[3303.80s -> 3305.16s]  Like all these levels aren't ones.
[3305.16s -> 3308.36s]  These are all ones that people have played and voted for.
[3308.36s -> 3310.20s]  And there's titties in it to some extent.
[3310.20s -> 3312.12s]  Oh, yeah, you know, but we can't.
[3312.12s -> 3312.44s]  What?
[3312.44s -> 3313.80s]  I'm not saying there's not titties.
[3314.36s -> 3316.68s]  You could get titties in a fucking zombies map.
[3316.68s -> 3317.64s]  Dude, these are all modded.
[3318.98s -> 3323.14s]  Mod map makers are historically just the strangest people in the world.
[3323.14s -> 3325.70s]  Why didn't you just download the fucking titty ones then?
[3326.58s -> 3327.14s]  We may have.
[3327.14s -> 3329.14s]  You know, it's part of the excitement.
[3329.14s -> 3330.98s]  It's like you never know if you're going to get titties or not.
[3331.94s -> 3333.14s]  Why did I agree to this?
[3333.94s -> 3336.66s]  This could have been playing Call of Juarez right now.
[3337.38s -> 3338.34s]  I'm ready.
[3338.34s -> 3339.94s]  All right, I'm going to invite you.
[3341.06s -> 3345.14s]  Yeah, you guys do the first one without me while I power download the last of these maps
[3345.14s -> 3347.54s]  and I'll join for the next one.
[3347.54s -> 3348.18s]  So we're going to start.
[3348.18s -> 3348.98s]  Do I have you guys on here?
[3348.98s -> 3350.34s]  Did you invite on Steam?
[3352.02s -> 3353.11s]  Did I make it in?
[3353.11s -> 3353.35s]  Let's see.
[3354.31s -> 3355.51s]  It says you're not in the game.
[3356.57s -> 3356.81s]  Me?
[3357.61s -> 3358.25s]  No, not Jerma.
[3358.25s -> 3358.81s]  I don't know about...
[3359.37s -> 3361.34s]  I don't even see you online, James.
[3362.14s -> 3363.42s]  Do I shut you in?
[3363.42s -> 3364.22s]  Did I accept that you're in?
[3364.22s -> 3364.78s]  No, I'm in the party.
[3364.78s -> 3365.90s]  Oh yeah, Jerma's in, Jerma's in.
[3367.59s -> 3367.91s]  Okay.
[3368.55s -> 3373.03s]  All right, so let me get off camera now because I'm disgustingly ugly.
[3374.18s -> 3375.38s]  Oh, don't say that.
[3375.38s -> 3376.82s]  All right, wait, hold on.
[3376.82s -> 3378.26s]  Is there anything I shouldn't be showing?
[3378.26s -> 3379.38s]  Is it like passwords or something?
[3379.38s -> 3380.50s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[3380.50s -> 3380.66s]  Okay.
[3381.62s -> 3384.10s]  Nope, the chances of anyone stumbling across our lobby is
[3384.66s -> 3386.18s]  uh, it's impossible.
[3386.18s -> 3389.22s]  These maps have been long hidden from the world.
[3389.22s -> 3390.18s]  Long hidden.
[3390.18s -> 3390.50s]  Hello?
[3391.06s -> 3391.62s]  Hello.
[3391.62s -> 3392.18s]  Hey.
[3392.18s -> 3395.22s]  Oh, the game like cut my mic out for some reason.
[3395.22s -> 3397.54s]  Oh yeah, the game's going to fuck with your mic 100%.
[3397.54s -> 3398.90s]  Yeah, if it closes at all,
[3398.90s -> 3401.22s]  you're going to need to go back into the properties and fix it.
[3403.59s -> 3406.70s]  All right.
[3406.70s -> 3408.14s]  If the game closes?
[3408.14s -> 3409.66s]  If it closes ever.
[3409.66s -> 3412.86s]  If the game even opens and minimizes again,
[3412.86s -> 3413.42s]  you're going to want to take a quick look.
[3413.42s -> 3415.82s]  I feel like the game just like auto-adjusted your mic
[3415.82s -> 3417.82s]  and made you like sound.
[3417.82s -> 3418.38s]  Because it did.
[3419.42s -> 3420.06s]  What?
[3420.06s -> 3420.62s]  It'll do that.
[3421.98s -> 3423.02s]  It'll take control of your mic
[3423.02s -> 3423.90s]  and it'll make you do things.
[3423.90s -> 3424.78s]  It's a parasite.
[3426.09s -> 3427.37s]  It's a parasite.
[3427.37s -> 3428.65s]  You think I'm fucking around.
[3428.65s -> 3429.69s]  Parasite.
[3429.69s -> 3430.41s]  You guys don't understand.
[3430.41s -> 3431.45s]  Wait, how do I fix this?
[3432.09s -> 3434.09s]  You don't, you just try to live with it.
[3434.09s -> 3434.97s]  You've got to go in your mixer
[3434.97s -> 3436.65s]  and change it afterwards once you get in.
[3436.65s -> 3436.89s]  Yeah.
[3436.89s -> 3437.69s]  Oh my god.
[3437.69s -> 3438.97s]  Didn't mean to call you a parasite.
[3438.97s -> 3441.29s]  Really just fucking made you all like really quiet.
[3444.04s -> 3447.00s]  This is, this is like akin to like video game archaeology.
[3447.00s -> 3449.24s]  Like we're just, we're digging through the remains
[3449.24s -> 3450.60s]  of this old game that no one plays anymore.
[3450.60s -> 3453.64s]  And we're finding these little gems from like on area.
[3453.64s -> 3454.36s]  This is truly bizarre, dude.
[3454.36s -> 3455.16s]  Okay, shift is run.
[3456.20s -> 3457.08s]  Left click is shoot.
[3457.72s -> 3459.24s]  Right click is melee.
[3459.24s -> 3460.12s]  How do you do that?
[3460.12s -> 3462.20s]  I've, I don't play any of these.
[3462.20s -> 3463.32s]  I'm going to be so lost.
[3465.16s -> 3466.20s]  Do we even melee zombies?
[3466.20s -> 3467.24s]  I guess you use the knife, right?
[3468.41s -> 3469.29s]  Is right click melee?
[3469.29s -> 3470.17s]  I don't think that's true.
[3470.17s -> 3470.97s]  Right click is aim.
[3471.77s -> 3473.08s]  Probably be like what?
[3473.08s -> 3473.88s]  F or something?
[3473.88s -> 3475.80s]  It should be V or F I think for melee.
[3475.80s -> 3477.77s]  Oh my god.
[3477.77s -> 3478.49s]  It's easy.
[3478.49s -> 3481.37s]  It's like, this was the first zombie game.
[3481.37s -> 3484.57s]  So, you know, they all could just kind of copy that.
[3485.21s -> 3486.01s]  Play one, play them all.
[3489.02s -> 3493.18s]  I like bump you guys up on everything else except for the game.
[3494.86s -> 3497.34s]  Yeah, the game messes with your mic.
[3498.58s -> 3500.90s]  So it blows us up and then we have to turn each other down.
[3501.46s -> 3503.86s]  If I minimize it, will it be fine?
[3505.10s -> 3505.82s]  Yeah, it should be.
[3505.82s -> 3507.42s]  If you can get to your mixer.
[3507.42s -> 3507.74s]  What?
[3507.74s -> 3508.30s]  Oh, there you are.
[3508.30s -> 3508.54s]  Okay.
[3508.54s -> 3509.82s]  I'm going to invite you now, James.
[3509.82s -> 3510.94s]  Is F's what the fuck?
[3510.94s -> 3511.74s]  I see no F's.
[3512.62s -> 3514.86s]  Stop saying F's.
[3514.86s -> 3515.50s]  There's no F's.
[3515.50s -> 3516.30s]  I don't see any F's.
[3518.15s -> 3518.95s]  Y'all crazy.
[3518.95s -> 3521.35s]  I think they're saying F for squad.
[3522.15s -> 3523.43s]  Oh, did I never?
[3523.43s -> 3523.83s]  Hold on.
[3524.47s -> 3529.00s]  What a fucking confusing thing then.
[3530.02s -> 3533.14s]  Also, Kraken, what the fuck have you done on that fucking RP server, my man?
[3533.70s -> 3535.54s]  Oh, I've done some fucked up stuff, dude.
[3535.54s -> 3537.14s]  Yeah, I fucking heard last night.
[3539.46s -> 3541.78s]  They were telling stories about a crime bus.
[3543.00s -> 3543.50s]  Yeah.
[3545.29s -> 3547.77s]  You know, like, you guys are like enemy.
[3547.77s -> 3550.09s]  You're like public enemy number one on that server.
[3550.65s -> 3551.21s]  We are?
[3551.21s -> 3552.25s]  I didn't do anything.
[3552.25s -> 3554.01s]  I've never committed a crime on that server.
[3554.01s -> 3555.05s]  Yes, you are.
[3555.05s -> 3556.17s]  Like, you're fucking.
[3556.17s -> 3557.61s]  You're like known by everybody.
[3557.61s -> 3560.89s]  I think every conversation that I had, they talk about the PP boys and like some
[3560.89s -> 3562.01s]  of the shit you guys did.
[3562.01s -> 3564.49s]  That's like how I guess I could gather some of the info.
[3564.49s -> 3565.69s]  Got that scene switch ready.
[3565.69s -> 3566.25s]  I told you.
[3566.25s -> 3566.73s]  I'm prepared.
[3566.73s -> 3567.85s]  You should accept the squad invite.
[3567.85s -> 3568.41s]  Just testing it out.
[3568.41s -> 3569.13s]  Make sure it works.
[3569.13s -> 3569.93s]  Launch it.
[3569.93s -> 3572.17s]  You know what it is?
[3572.17s -> 3572.73s]  I don't know.
[3572.73s -> 3573.45s]  I don't.
[3573.45s -> 3574.89s]  You go to your dashboard and you scroll down.
[3574.89s -> 3577.61s]  There should be a squad stream section and you just go to invites and hit accept.
[3577.61s -> 3580.47s]  Oh, shit, dude.
[3580.47s -> 3581.99s]  This is revolutionary.
[3581.99s -> 3582.31s]  Yeah.
[3582.31s -> 3584.31s]  Yeah, they were pretty cool implementation.
[3585.19s -> 3585.99s]  Nice, dude.
[3587.64s -> 3591.00s]  Also, Jerma, dude, I love your fucking VR stuff that you've been doing as of late.
[3592.28s -> 3593.00s]  It's a lot of fun.
[3593.00s -> 3593.64s]  Thanks.
[3593.64s -> 3597.40s]  Some of the shit that you've been your green screen stuff that you're doing the
[3597.40s -> 3597.88s]  one night.
[3598.60s -> 3600.36s]  I was like, what the fuck is this?
[3600.92s -> 3601.80s]  But it was so good.
[3602.60s -> 3603.00s]  Yeah.
[3603.00s -> 3607.08s]  The community came together and made some absolutely fucking hilarious things.
[3607.08s -> 3611.69s]  So all right.
[3611.69s -> 3612.97s]  Squad mode, I guess.
[3612.97s -> 3614.17s]  I've never I've never done.
[3615.29s -> 3616.73s]  Do I get an achievement for that?
[3616.73s -> 3617.29s]  Probably, dude.
[3618.74s -> 3621.86s]  Put that on your jacket for now.
[3621.86s -> 3622.50s]  Like a little patch.
[3625.02s -> 3627.90s]  I tried to put it on the next twitch hoodie.
[3629.10s -> 3629.96s]  All right.
[3629.96s -> 3630.60s]  I send you an invite.
[3630.60s -> 3632.04s]  You should be able to join our lobby.
[3633.08s -> 3633.88s]  Should I go change right now?
[3633.88s -> 3635.24s]  I'll go put my twitch shirt on.
[3635.24s -> 3637.16s]  Oh, I got my twitch hoodie right here, too.
[3637.16s -> 3637.64s]  Is it on?
[3638.36s -> 3639.00s]  Oh, my God.
[3639.00s -> 3639.80s]  I threw it on the floor.
[3639.80s -> 3640.44s]  I'll pick it up.
[3640.44s -> 3642.52s]  Fuck on the floor on the floor.
[3643.50s -> 3647.26s]  Oh, you hang it up and you you steam clean that and steam it every day.
[3653.27s -> 3654.39s]  I ain't going to go get by.
[3654.39s -> 3655.35s]  I don't care.
[3655.35s -> 3658.09s]  I don't know.
[3658.09s -> 3659.37s]  I just like make them go get that.
[3660.01s -> 3663.35s]  I think we're all just being twitch ambassadors right now.
[3663.35s -> 3664.79s]  Twitch ambassador.
[3664.79s -> 3665.27s]  No, dude.
[3665.27s -> 3667.19s]  I'm a stream labs ambassador.
[3667.19s -> 3669.91s]  Oh, OK.
[3669.91s -> 3671.19s]  Do you have a stream lab or something?
[3679.54s -> 3680.90s]  I have no idea.
[3680.98s -> 3684.74s]  How do I all tab out of the game to fucking get to your guys' settings
[3684.74s -> 3685.78s]  so I can bump you up?
[3686.42s -> 3689.38s]  Just go to your like your Windows mixer or go to Discord or click.
[3689.38s -> 3691.70s]  I can't even click out of your black ops.
[3691.70s -> 3693.54s]  I'm going to like it if you try to leave.
[3695.14s -> 3702.68s]  Yeah, I haven't had that problem.
[3703.54s -> 3705.86s]  And then you make it windowed mode instead of full screen.
[3707.08s -> 3710.84s]  Where's the where's the actual settings for for black ops?
[3711.08s -> 3714.68s]  Go to the menu and then graphics from there.
[3715.32s -> 3717.93s]  They have windowed borderless window.
[3718.65s -> 3720.44s]  So that'll do it.
[3721.08s -> 3726.47s]  We could start a map in the meantime to take you there.
[3727.11s -> 3729.35s]  There's like fucking in here.
[3729.35s -> 3729.85s]  Yeah.
[3730.98s -> 3733.78s]  Yeah, it'll take me like a couple more seconds to be ready to go
[3733.78s -> 3738.60s]  because my drive lied to me, but I'll be ready to go after like one map.
[3739.32s -> 3741.94s]  Yeah, I mean, we can do whatever.
[3747.14s -> 3747.78s]  How about this?
[3747.78s -> 3748.34s]  You want cracking?
[3748.34s -> 3750.18s]  Can you like just teach me how to play black ops?
[3750.58s -> 3752.66s]  Yeah, do like a warm up.
[3752.66s -> 3754.18s]  Well, we'll start the map.
[3754.18s -> 3754.98s]  I'll walk you around.
[3754.98s -> 3756.82s]  I'll give I'll teach the ropes.
[3756.82s -> 3757.14s]  Yeah.
[3757.14s -> 3760.18s]  And then, you know, bring on the horde.
[3761.24s -> 3761.88s]  Yeah, of course.
[3763.72s -> 3765.32s]  That's what we say when you're a zombie hunt.
[3765.32s -> 3766.12s]  You say bring on the horde.
[3766.92s -> 3769.40s]  This is Minecraft zombies, Minecraft, but with zombies.
[3770.82s -> 3771.30s]  What?
[3771.30s -> 3772.90s]  Beta 0.15.
[3774.02s -> 3778.12s]  They got a ways to go to release, but I I have faith.
[3778.12s -> 3779.40s]  I think they're gonna get there.
[3779.40s -> 3781.48s]  Beta 0.1.5.
[3782.84s -> 3786.52s]  Let me go ahead and take a cursory check when that map was made for you guys.
[3786.52s -> 3790.01s]  Yeah, Minecraft with an EI.
[3791.37s -> 3798.09s]  This was released in beta form back in June 14th of 2017.
[3798.09s -> 3800.41s]  It was like they didn't get the funding for this one.
[3801.29s -> 3802.57s]  They weren't able to finish it up.
[3802.57s -> 3803.69s]  One of these is going to be a screamer.
[3803.69s -> 3804.65s]  I just know what I'm telling you.
[3805.21s -> 3806.33s]  Isn't this nice?
[3806.33s -> 3809.13s]  Look, it's like Minecraft, but also a bit of zombies.
[3809.13s -> 3811.21s]  It's not a 32 bit texture pack.
[3811.21s -> 3812.65s]  Oh, what's that over there?
[3813.85s -> 3815.05s]  Hey, wait, are you already playing?
[3815.05s -> 3816.17s]  I just fixed my stuff.
[3816.17s -> 3816.89s]  What the fuck?
[3816.89s -> 3818.09s]  We just started a map.
[3818.09s -> 3818.97s]  I'm teaching this boy.
[3818.97s -> 3820.25s]  He's never seen his own pistol.
[3820.25s -> 3821.13s]  God dang it, dude.
[3823.37s -> 3827.14s]  Man, he's a natural.
[3827.14s -> 3828.02s]  Look, he's already doing it.
[3828.82s -> 3829.72s]  Headshots only.
[3830.76s -> 3832.52s]  So actually on the first wave,
[3832.52s -> 3833.48s]  you're going to want to use the knife.
[3833.48s -> 3834.36s]  It gets you more money.
[3835.32s -> 3836.76s]  Oh, that's grenade.
[3837.56s -> 3838.12s]  It's a V.
[3839.56s -> 3840.20s]  V is the knife.
[3842.20s -> 3843.48s]  It's as if somebody shakes your head.
[3844.36s -> 3847.43s]  Are you teaching him how to just play like zombies legit?
[3847.43s -> 3850.07s]  He's never played zombies in my life.
[3850.95s -> 3852.47s]  This is going to be a great first experience.
[3853.59s -> 3854.55s]  I mean, like ever.
[3854.55s -> 3855.35s]  Custom maps.
[3859.27s -> 3860.55s]  Should we clear debris?
[3860.55s -> 3862.47s]  What's the clear debris supposed to be?
[3862.47s -> 3863.75s]  I think it just opens up more of the map
[3863.75s -> 3864.87s]  so we can get more of the items.
[3865.43s -> 3867.11s]  But it costs the points to use the points
[3867.11s -> 3868.39s]  to buy better guns, basically.
[3868.39s -> 3869.51s]  Dude, I swear to God,
[3869.51s -> 3871.67s]  I've seen the same map in fucking Gmod.
[3871.67s -> 3873.43s]  This is like a conversion or something.
[3874.15s -> 3874.79s]  Really?
[3874.79s -> 3876.79s]  You'll see that a lot.
[3878.31s -> 3879.19s]  Well, this is stupid.
[3879.19s -> 3879.67s]  I don't want to play.
[3879.67s -> 3880.39s]  I'll see you guys later.
[3883.03s -> 3884.63s]  I'm starting to see why everyone said no
[3884.63s -> 3886.39s]  when I asked them to play tonight.
[3886.39s -> 3886.95s]  Oh, dude.
[3886.95s -> 3888.79s]  We were like the last invitees.
[3890.07s -> 3891.27s]  We had weaves, really.
[3891.27s -> 3891.67s]  Oh, no.
[3891.67s -> 3892.79s]  We're at the bottom.
[3892.79s -> 3894.07s]  We're at the scraps.
[3894.07s -> 3895.35s]  You guys were the Hail Mary
[3895.35s -> 3896.95s]  and you both said yes and it's like,
[3897.51s -> 3899.83s]  yeah, still on.
[3899.83s -> 3901.75s]  Oh, James got in.
[3902.31s -> 3903.59s]  Yeah, I joined in progress.
[3903.59s -> 3904.39s]  How do I?
[3904.39s -> 3905.11s]  What's the melee?
[3906.47s -> 3907.35s]  I got to refine that.
[3907.35s -> 3908.47s]  That's gross, dude.
[3908.47s -> 3909.91s]  Yeah, so we got instakill there,
[3909.91s -> 3911.59s]  which meant whenever you hit a zombie,
[3911.59s -> 3912.39s]  they die in one hit.
[3913.72s -> 3914.44s]  That is true.
[3915.32s -> 3916.20s]  Wait, are you teaching me
[3916.20s -> 3917.16s]  or are you still teaching German?
[3917.16s -> 3918.60s]  I'm just kind of teaching the room.
[3918.60s -> 3920.28s]  You know, you can listen or you don't have to.
[3921.88s -> 3923.32s]  Which weapon is X?
[3923.32s -> 3924.04s]  Who made that?
[3924.84s -> 3925.64s]  It should be Q.
[3926.60s -> 3927.16s]  Behind you.
[3928.12s -> 3929.83s]  OK, we're down.
[3929.83s -> 3930.39s]  It's over.
[3930.39s -> 3931.43s]  Fucking pistol.
[3936.60s -> 3938.07s]  Are you kidding me?
[3938.07s -> 3941.43s]  OK, well, I got my controls anyway.
[3942.55s -> 3944.31s]  Q is your special three.
[3944.31s -> 3946.55s]  Wait, your mic.
[3949.91s -> 3951.43s]  I told you, whenever you start the game,
[3954.84s -> 3956.28s]  that's like you opened your mouth
[3956.28s -> 3958.44s]  and put like the Xbox mic in your mouth,
[3958.44s -> 3960.28s]  close your lips around it slowly.
[3962.68s -> 3965.00s]  That's like the old Xbox 360 mic,
[3965.00s -> 3966.52s]  too, the fucking old quality one.
[3967.48s -> 3968.84s]  All right.
[3968.84s -> 3969.88s]  So that was pretty bad.
[3969.88s -> 3972.36s]  We're going to look for a better one.
[3972.36s -> 3974.23s]  That was probably about two gigs.
[3974.23s -> 3975.51s]  Do you buy stuff in zombies?
[3975.51s -> 3975.99s]  You do, right?
[3976.63s -> 3978.31s]  Yeah, you buy more guns
[3978.31s -> 3979.91s]  and upgrades to those guns.
[3979.91s -> 3980.95s]  Oh, so it's like Counter-Strike.
[3980.95s -> 3981.75s]  That's what they got it from.
[3982.71s -> 3983.67s]  Yeah, I stole from zombies.
[3984.71s -> 3985.19s]  No, no, no.
[3985.19s -> 3985.99s]  I'm saying counter-strike.
[3987.75s -> 3989.35s]  Yeah, whatever you want to tell yourself, dude.
[3990.39s -> 3991.43s]  Zombies was the first.
[3991.43s -> 3992.07s]  Candyland.
[3992.07s -> 3993.11s]  Wanna play Candyland?
[3993.11s -> 3994.31s]  I don't know if I want to play Candyland.
[3994.31s -> 3995.67s]  Oh, like the board game?
[3995.67s -> 3997.03s]  Yeah, the board game, but it's zombies.
[3997.75s -> 3998.25s]  Nice.
[3999.75s -> 4001.03s]  There's turkey survival.
[4002.34s -> 4003.06s]  That sounds fun.
[4003.96s -> 4004.68s]  All right.
[4004.68s -> 4006.12s]  Turkey survival?
[4006.12s -> 4007.40s]  So here's the thing.
[4007.40s -> 4009.48s]  There's clearly meme maps
[4009.48s -> 4011.80s]  and then there's potentially good maps
[4011.80s -> 4013.16s]  and there's somewhere in the middle.
[4014.28s -> 4016.52s]  Don't blow every meme map at once,
[4016.52s -> 4018.76s]  trust me, because eventually we'll run out of those.
[4018.76s -> 4020.04s]  They're going to get burnt out real quick.
[4020.04s -> 4021.48s]  We're going to run out of them.
[4021.48s -> 4024.60s]  And then we're just going to be playing cod zombies on stream.
[4024.60s -> 4027.53s]  You need to throw out a titty map at some point.
[4027.53s -> 4030.15s]  Look, we may have been promising a lot
[4030.15s -> 4031.19s]  if we promised titties.
[4032.23s -> 4033.83s]  I'm willing to bet there's titties.
[4033.83s -> 4035.83s]  I'm willing to lie as much as it takes
[4035.83s -> 4037.67s]  to get people in for a session
[4037.67s -> 4039.43s]  of cod zombies meme stream.
[4039.43s -> 4040.31s]  All right, I'll tell you guys.
[4041.83s -> 4043.43s]  Sonic zombies.
[4043.43s -> 4045.27s]  McDonald's custom zombies.
[4045.27s -> 4046.15s]  McDonald's custom?
[4046.15s -> 4046.95s]  Why would you make them McDonald's?
[4046.95s -> 4048.79s]  The amount of food brand maps that I found.
[4048.79s -> 4051.19s]  Taco Bell 2.0.
[4051.19s -> 4053.43s]  The amount of food brand maps I was able to find.
[4053.43s -> 4054.47s]  We got KFC in there.
[4054.47s -> 4055.83s]  KFC 3.0.
[4055.83s -> 4056.71s]  Pick all the food ones.
[4056.79s -> 4058.31s]  Do the food ones back to back to back.
[4058.31s -> 4059.91s]  Ashley, this one looks good.
[4059.91s -> 4061.03s]  And then we have to decide.
[4061.03s -> 4062.71s]  You guys have to talk about your favorite
[4062.71s -> 4065.10s]  favorite fast food restaurants after we do it.
[4065.10s -> 4067.67s]  Yeah, is there a Wendy's one?
[4067.67s -> 4070.07s]  There's no, I only see Taco Bell, KFC and McDonald's.
[4070.87s -> 4072.87s]  None of them will respond to you on social.
[4072.87s -> 4075.16s]  Yeah, Wendy's will though.
[4075.16s -> 4076.36s]  Yeah, Wendy's sticks to this shit.
[4077.24s -> 4080.71s]  Does anyone want to try Super Mario Halloween?
[4080.71s -> 4082.15s]  Just fucking pick one, dude.
[4082.15s -> 4082.87s]  Oh my God.
[4082.87s -> 4084.55s]  Super Mario Halloween.
[4085.67s -> 4086.87s]  This one looks good.
[4086.87s -> 4088.47s]  This one looks high quality compared to the others.
[4088.71s -> 4090.31s]  Mario Dracula teeth then.
[4091.66s -> 4092.22s]  Yeah.
[4092.22s -> 4093.42s]  You think there'll be titties in this one?
[4094.14s -> 4096.42s]  I hope there's titties in one of these.
[4097.06s -> 4098.34s]  Looking to get banned today.
[4098.34s -> 4100.02s]  Start without me for one more.
[4100.02s -> 4101.14s]  What the fuck?
[4101.14s -> 4102.34s]  This might be the long haul, Tomato.
[4103.38s -> 4104.98s]  I'm willing to sit out the long haul
[4104.98s -> 4106.74s]  to make sure it's actually fucking.
[4107.78s -> 4109.06s]  To put it into perspective,
[4109.06s -> 4112.02s]  my disk drive was so afraid of downloading the maps
[4112.02s -> 4113.38s]  that it actually lied to me
[4113.38s -> 4115.78s]  so I wouldn't have to put Call of Duty on my disk.
[4115.78s -> 4118.66s]  So when I went on today, it listed all the maps.
[4118.66s -> 4121.54s]  But when I went over to my workshop ID thing,
[4121.54s -> 4123.94s]  like the actual download page, it just said no space.
[4125.70s -> 4129.94s]  So right now, I'm using all 100 megabytes down at once
[4129.94s -> 4132.42s]  to blast every mod back onto my game.
[4132.42s -> 4134.10s]  That is too many megabytes at the same time.
[4134.10s -> 4134.90s]  Damn.
[4134.90s -> 4137.54s]  I've actually never seen Steam provide this many megabytes.
[4137.54s -> 4138.90s]  I think Gabe feels bad for me
[4138.90s -> 4139.86s]  because he's letting him in.
[4141.14s -> 4142.10s]  What do you have selected here?
[4142.98s -> 4145.94s]  We have Mario Halloween.
[4145.94s -> 4146.58s]  Okay.
[4146.58s -> 4147.46s]  Let's try to beat this one.
[4148.10s -> 4149.14s]  I think we can beat this one.
[4150.50s -> 4151.62s]  I've played Mario a couple of times,
[4151.62s -> 4152.90s]  so I know my way around the.
[4152.90s -> 4155.38s]  We've beat zombie levels on this stream.
[4155.38s -> 4155.94s]  We have.
[4155.94s -> 4157.54s]  We beat the Star Wars one.
[4157.54s -> 4158.34s]  How do you beat it?
[4158.34s -> 4159.54s]  We also beat Star Wars.
[4159.54s -> 4161.70s]  You have to pay like an absurd amount of money
[4161.70s -> 4163.62s]  that no one would ever save in COD Zombies.
[4163.62s -> 4164.50s]  And that lets you leave.
[4164.50s -> 4164.74s]  Yeah.
[4164.74s -> 4166.26s]  There's usually like a little giant.
[4166.26s -> 4166.98s]  Oh, nice.
[4166.98s -> 4168.58s]  Do they give you like a cutscene at the end?
[4169.54s -> 4170.10s]  Sometimes.
[4170.10s -> 4170.50s]  Yeah.
[4170.50s -> 4171.06s]  Yeah.
[4171.06s -> 4172.90s]  The Star Wars one we flew away in the Millennium Falcon.
[4172.90s -> 4174.10s]  Press start to play.
[4174.10s -> 4174.58s]  You hear that?
[4174.58s -> 4175.94s]  Press start to play.
[4175.94s -> 4176.74s]  Press start to play.
[4176.74s -> 4177.30s]  Oh, God.
[4177.30s -> 4178.50s]  Is that going to do that?
[4178.50s -> 4179.38s]  Why does it keep saying it?
[4179.38s -> 4180.58s]  It keeps happening.
[4180.58s -> 4181.38s]  Is it the Goomba?
[4183.06s -> 4183.46s]  I don't know.
[4183.46s -> 4184.74s]  Are the Goombas the zombies?
[4184.74s -> 4185.78s]  Oh, they're behind us.
[4185.78s -> 4186.34s]  Oh, they're just.
[4186.34s -> 4187.14s]  They're just zombies, though.
[4187.14s -> 4187.62s]  They're not.
[4187.62s -> 4188.82s]  They're just regular zombies.
[4190.82s -> 4193.94s]  There are some levels that have custom zombies,
[4193.94s -> 4194.98s]  like full custom.
[4194.98s -> 4196.82s]  This is literally just a fucking plug
[4196.82s -> 4198.50s]  for this person's YouTube channel.
[4198.50s -> 4200.90s]  I definitely do remember the Halloween Mario one.
[4200.90s -> 4201.14s]  Yeah.
[4201.14s -> 4203.38s]  Why is Bowser T-posing over there?
[4205.46s -> 4206.98s]  There was a good Mario level I picked,
[4206.98s -> 4209.06s]  and then there was this one that I picked as like the.
[4209.06s -> 4209.62s]  God damn it.
[4210.26s -> 4211.14s]  You picked another one.
[4211.14s -> 4212.18s]  I picked the wrong one.
[4218.74s -> 4220.26s]  Why did we choose to do this again?
[4220.26s -> 4221.46s]  Is that even Bowser or is that?
[4221.46s -> 4222.34s]  No, that's like one of the.
[4222.34s -> 4223.62s]  That's one of the Bowser's kids.
[4226.10s -> 4228.02s]  On the left side, the ginormous Bowser.
[4228.02s -> 4228.82s]  You're missing the big guy.
[4229.86s -> 4231.22s]  Oh, I thought you were talking about like Greco,
[4231.22s -> 4232.18s]  whatever his name is.
[4232.18s -> 4234.34s]  Greco, the famous Bowser.
[4234.34s -> 4236.34s]  It's like Greco, Beco, Deco.
[4236.90s -> 4237.94s]  They all have the same name.
[4237.94s -> 4238.50s]  And then Iggy.
[4238.50s -> 4239.54s]  I bought a new pathway.
[4241.30s -> 4243.77s]  What the fuck?
[4247.88s -> 4248.52s]  Oh shit.
[4249.48s -> 4250.76s]  Oh, you opened the path?
[4250.76s -> 4252.20s]  Yeah, I opened the path over here.
[4252.20s -> 4252.68s]  All right, cool.
[4252.68s -> 4253.16s]  What do we got?
[4254.04s -> 4254.54s]  Nothing.
[4255.40s -> 4255.88s]  Nothing?
[4255.88s -> 4258.84s]  You can hit this block and maybe get something out of it.
[4258.84s -> 4259.34s]  What?
[4260.52s -> 4261.24s]  Like a power up?
[4261.24s -> 4263.40s]  But I stopped to play my game.
[4263.40s -> 4263.96s]  That was it.
[4266.20s -> 4268.76s]  That was the only audio clip from Mario in this whole map.
[4269.72s -> 4276.02s]  Maybe we can get to if we get to Bowser,
[4276.02s -> 4278.82s]  we can get to the castle over there and we can we can win.
[4281.14s -> 4285.46s]  Somewhere in that collection is a fully modeled Mario 64 castle level.
[4285.46s -> 4287.94s]  And you guys picked Bowser T-pose.
[4287.94s -> 4289.46s]  All right, how am I supposed to know?
[4289.46s -> 4290.74s]  That's not this at all.
[4293.86s -> 4296.90s]  Yeah, was there a bullet drop in a bullet drop realistic?
[4299.70s -> 4301.62s]  The last time I shot a gun in Call of Duty,
[4301.62s -> 4303.22s]  I was like 19.
[4303.22s -> 4303.78s]  Here, hit this.
[4303.78s -> 4304.82s]  Hit this.
[4304.82s -> 4305.38s]  Pick this up.
[4306.10s -> 4306.58s]  Hit this?
[4307.62s -> 4309.32s]  Was that the times two?
[4309.32s -> 4310.44s]  That nukes all of them.
[4310.44s -> 4312.20s]  I'm just telling them, you know.
[4312.20s -> 4313.40s]  This is an early round, man.
[4313.40s -> 4314.68s]  You don't even know these strats.
[4314.68s -> 4315.64s]  Yeah, why don't you pick it up?
[4315.64s -> 4318.28s]  I'm talking Call of Duty 3, by the way, for those of you in the chat.
[4320.20s -> 4321.40s]  19, how?
[4321.40s -> 4321.96s]  I'll do it.
[4322.84s -> 4323.96s]  Oh, that was good.
[4324.84s -> 4325.56s]  That was an audio.
[4326.76s -> 4328.04s]  T-posing skeletons?
[4328.76s -> 4329.72s]  What does this do?
[4329.72s -> 4331.08s]  Let's turn on the power first.
[4331.08s -> 4332.28s]  These are not from Mario.
[4336.73s -> 4337.77s]  Should I clear one of these?
[4338.49s -> 4339.29s]  Sure, why not?
[4339.29s -> 4340.65s]  I got news for you, friend.
[4340.65s -> 4341.61s]  I just spent a lot of money.
[4341.61s -> 4347.13s]  The strangest thing about Call of Duty zombies mod maps is that almost all of them,
[4347.13s -> 4350.33s]  even if it's not seasonally, you know, accurate at all,
[4350.33s -> 4352.41s]  are either Christmas or Halloween related.
[4352.41s -> 4356.49s]  I've seen Christmas levels launched in June on fucking zombies.
[4357.37s -> 4358.49s]  Shit, you're not.
[4358.49s -> 4359.45s]  Hundreds of them.
[4359.45s -> 4360.81s]  It's like almost every single one.
[4360.81s -> 4363.05s]  So this is going to have a lot of Christmas levels and Halloween levels.
[4363.05s -> 4363.85s]  Is it Garfield?
[4363.85s -> 4364.41s]  No, that's the...
[4364.97s -> 4366.17s]  Oh, dude, do you hear that?
[4366.17s -> 4367.37s]  That was Mario's sound.
[4367.37s -> 4367.87s]  Yeah.
[4371.53s -> 4374.94s]  It's about how you can buy weapons.
[4376.94s -> 4378.06s]  I don't like this.
[4379.50s -> 4380.22s]  You're not having fun.
[4380.22s -> 4380.86s]  I'm gonna have money.
[4384.14s -> 4384.70s]  What is he saying?
[4387.90s -> 4388.70s]  The horror.
[4388.70s -> 4389.20s]  Oh.
[4395.32s -> 4395.82s]  Monopoly.
[4398.20s -> 4401.00s]  Because that's when it gets real modded.
[4401.00s -> 4402.04s]  Yeah, I'm honestly feeling...
[4402.04s -> 4403.96s]  Play Monopoly in zombies?
[4403.96s -> 4405.40s]  Like full-on Monopoly?
[4405.40s -> 4407.88s]  I'll tell you guys one thing about Monopoly zombies.
[4407.88s -> 4409.64s]  Last time me and Kraken tried that one,
[4409.64s -> 4412.92s]  I don't even think we made it past Go before we did the whole thing.
[4412.92s -> 4414.44s]  We died before going past Go.
[4418.04s -> 4420.12s]  I'm sure these guys are better, though, you know?
[4420.12s -> 4421.80s]  We've brought together the greatest gaming teams.
[4421.80s -> 4422.52s]  Yeah, these are the best.
[4423.56s -> 4424.20s]  This is like...
[4425.40s -> 4427.80s]  This is like the Mario noises.
[4427.80s -> 4430.44s]  This is just a meme.
[4430.44s -> 4432.04s]  Somebody just thought this was fun.
[4432.04s -> 4432.28s]  And you know what?
[4432.28s -> 4433.32s]  They spend a lot of time on it.
[4433.32s -> 4433.72s]  You can tell.
[4434.36s -> 4435.16s]  Yeah, come on.
[4435.16s -> 4435.96s]  Come on, some slack.
[4435.96s -> 4437.00s]  That toad is on fire.
[4437.72s -> 4438.76s]  I turned the power on.
[4438.76s -> 4440.12s]  What did that even do?
[4440.12s -> 4442.04s]  It powered up these juice boxes.
[4443.00s -> 4443.96s]  Wait, I have the best gun in the game.
[4443.96s -> 4445.32s]  I thought I was gonna do something cool with the map.
[4445.32s -> 4445.80s]  Like, what the f...
[4445.80s -> 4446.76s]  Is the best gun in the game?
[4446.76s -> 4447.96s]  I have the Wonder Waffle.
[4448.68s -> 4449.32s]  Oh, that is good.
[4449.32s -> 4451.08s]  That is the best gun in the whole game?
[4451.08s -> 4451.96s]  The best gun in the whole game?
[4451.96s -> 4452.46s]  I got it?
[4453.72s -> 4454.22s]  Yeah.
[4454.30s -> 4455.18s]  We win, dude.
[4455.18s -> 4457.02s]  Actually, did we save it?
[4458.22s -> 4459.02s]  No, there's no saving it.
[4459.02s -> 4459.74s]  Just don't die.
[4459.74s -> 4460.86s]  What do you mean don't die?
[4460.86s -> 4461.66s]  What do you mean don't die?
[4461.66s -> 4462.38s]  What about ammo?
[4463.32s -> 4466.60s]  Well, you can't get a max ammo for you.
[4466.60s -> 4467.56s]  Is there infinite ammo?
[4468.76s -> 4469.72s]  What are these fact zombies?
[4469.72s -> 4470.76s]  So I'm not gonna use it then.
[4470.76s -> 4471.96s]  I'm gonna hold on to it until we have the boss.
[4471.96s -> 4472.52s]  They're back here.
[4473.72s -> 4474.22s]  Boss.
[4476.32s -> 4477.68s]  That T-posing boss is gonna drop down.
[4477.68s -> 4478.24s]  There you go.
[4478.24s -> 4479.04s]  You got ammo back.
[4479.04s -> 4479.52s]  Look at that.
[4479.52s -> 4480.08s]  Oh.
[4480.08s -> 4482.88s]  There are bosses that are modded into some of these mods, by the way.
[4482.88s -> 4483.44s]  Yeah.
[4483.92s -> 4486.16s]  It's like actual full sequences in this game.
[4486.16s -> 4488.16s]  And Darth Vader knows fucking hype.
[4488.16s -> 4489.52s]  But this one, I don't think has a boss.
[4489.52s -> 4491.20s]  You keep talking about like cool instances.
[4491.20s -> 4491.60s]  I know.
[4491.60s -> 4494.32s]  I mean, hey, hey, I'm not here to pick the maps out, all right?
[4494.32s -> 4496.96s]  This is an uncurated Kraken version right now.
[4496.96s -> 4498.64s]  I'm still redownloading the mods.
[4498.64s -> 4500.40s]  I feel like I invited you guys to my party
[4500.40s -> 4501.60s]  and like only three people showed up
[4501.60s -> 4503.44s]  and then they're all just shitting on the fact
[4503.44s -> 4504.64s]  that I don't have any decorations.
[4506.16s -> 4507.36s]  You watered down the booze.
[4509.04s -> 4510.24s]  I wanted them to last longer, dude.
[4510.24s -> 4511.28s]  I know how to show up.
[4511.28s -> 4512.64s]  So I want to make sure they had enough.
[4512.64s -> 4516.62s]  Look, my plan was originally to fake you guys out
[4516.62s -> 4518.94s]  and start the map downloading on Minecraft
[4518.94s -> 4520.86s]  and then swap it last second to Kiddyland.
[4520.86s -> 4521.74s]  Surprise you guys.
[4521.74s -> 4522.54s]  Then I was going to, you know,
[4522.54s -> 4523.90s]  then we're going to switch to a nice one after that.
[4523.90s -> 4525.58s]  But the whole team has been ruined.
[4526.78s -> 4529.52s]  Well, if you didn't tell us, I would have felt for it.
[4531.52s -> 4533.36s]  I'm not the host yet because I'm still here.
[4533.36s -> 4535.04s]  How long does the zombies game actually take
[4535.04s -> 4536.32s]  did you start to finish?
[4536.32s -> 4537.84s]  Oh, it depends.
[4537.84s -> 4540.00s]  The normal ones don't really have like an end.
[4540.00s -> 4541.68s]  So you just fucking keep going.
[4542.32s -> 4545.44s]  We beat the original Minecraft one from last time
[4545.44s -> 4546.88s]  we played this in like 15.
[4546.88s -> 4548.08s]  Can I not kill this guy?
[4548.08s -> 4549.36s]  No, it was like 20 to 30.
[4550.08s -> 4550.88s]  And the Star Wars one,
[4550.88s -> 4552.40s]  I guess it was about an hour and a half.
[4552.40s -> 4554.64s]  Star Wars one was a passion project.
[4554.64s -> 4555.68s]  Yeah, that was it.
[4555.68s -> 4556.16s]  That was it.
[4556.16s -> 4556.72s]  That was a trip.
[4559.37s -> 4562.73s]  We'll, if we just keep progressing,
[4562.73s -> 4564.25s]  we can get further to the end.
[4564.25s -> 4567.37s]  And then maybe we can fight Bowser and save Princess Peach.
[4567.37s -> 4568.33s]  All I care about is Bowser.
[4568.33s -> 4568.81s]  That's it.
[4568.81s -> 4570.73s]  I mean, I can't, I'm going to shoot this into his mouth.
[4571.29s -> 4573.13s]  I don't know what this means.
[4573.29s -> 4576.89s]  Oh, you hear that?
[4576.89s -> 4578.09s]  That means there's dogs.
[4578.09s -> 4578.81s]  Dogs?
[4578.81s -> 4579.61s]  Oh my God.
[4580.33s -> 4581.71s]  Here they come.
[4583.79s -> 4584.51s]  Hold them off.
[4584.51s -> 4585.95s]  Yeah, I can insta-kill these dogs.
[4585.95s -> 4586.43s]  Leave it to me.
[4586.43s -> 4588.51s]  Yeah, it's actually bad.
[4590.27s -> 4592.51s]  My sensitivity up by like two points and it's.
[4592.51s -> 4594.59s]  Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out.
[4596.81s -> 4597.21s]  All right.
[4598.81s -> 4600.24s]  All right, guys, my chest.
[4600.24s -> 4601.52s]  Tell me we got to wall run this.
[4601.52s -> 4602.96s]  Does anyone know how to wall run?
[4602.96s -> 4603.92s]  How the fuck do you do that?
[4603.92s -> 4604.48s]  Wall run?
[4605.44s -> 4607.12s]  Oh, get this animal.
[4607.12s -> 4607.60s]  I'm dead.
[4608.40s -> 4609.04s]  No, I'm not.
[4609.04s -> 4609.52s]  I'm okay.
[4610.48s -> 4613.20s]  I think if you just hold space, it'll do it when you jump.
[4614.00s -> 4614.96s]  But you have to be sprinting.
[4617.61s -> 4621.37s]  I mean, I just completely guess that.
[4621.37s -> 4623.29s]  I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it.
[4624.25s -> 4624.75s]  Yeah.
[4626.09s -> 4626.65s]  Oh my God.
[4626.65s -> 4627.13s]  Does it work?
[4630.14s -> 4631.02s]  Wait, you're still alive.
[4632.46s -> 4633.10s]  Hold space.
[4633.10s -> 4634.78s]  There's no consequences whatsoever.
[4634.78s -> 4638.27s]  So no.
[4638.27s -> 4638.91s]  What the fuck?
[4639.87s -> 4640.35s]  I don't understand.
[4640.35s -> 4641.31s]  How do you do that?
[4641.31s -> 4641.87s]  I think you.
[4641.87s -> 4644.11s]  Yeah, it's literally telling me.
[4647.12s -> 4647.92s]  Oh my God.
[4649.66s -> 4651.66s]  How do you fucking jump to the other side?
[4655.66s -> 4655.90s]  All right.
[4655.90s -> 4658.38s]  There's a guy with yellow eyes chasing me and then he's
[4658.38s -> 4659.74s]  hard because he doesn't die in one hit.
[4660.62s -> 4662.22s]  Wait, do they all have yellow eyes?
[4662.22s -> 4664.46s]  They, they, yeah, they all do.
[4664.46s -> 4665.98s]  Oh, there's one behind you.
[4665.98s -> 4666.54s]  Never mind.
[4668.14s -> 4668.38s]  All right.
[4668.38s -> 4669.02s]  I'm going to try this again.
[4671.07s -> 4671.79s]  Death machine.
[4673.07s -> 4674.19s]  What the fuck do you do?
[4674.83s -> 4675.39s]  Oh, no.
[4676.43s -> 4676.67s]  All right.
[4676.67s -> 4677.07s]  I can get you.
[4678.03s -> 4679.23s]  How do I get you?
[4679.23s -> 4680.11s]  I found it.
[4680.11s -> 4681.24s]  You pick them up.
[4681.24s -> 4681.80s]  I'll go.
[4681.80s -> 4682.52s]  I'll take care of them.
[4683.42s -> 4684.94s]  Did I think, did I just use an item on you?
[4686.14s -> 4687.02s]  No, you're good.
[4687.82s -> 4689.26s]  I got max ammo.
[4689.26s -> 4694.60s]  All right.
[4694.60s -> 4695.64s]  Let's try this again.
[4705.24s -> 4707.80s]  It's almost like when you don't stick on the second part.
[4708.68s -> 4708.84s]  Yeah.
[4710.84s -> 4711.56s]  I can do it, dude.
[4711.56s -> 4712.36s]  Watch me.
[4712.36s -> 4713.72s]  How did you fucking jump?
[4713.72s -> 4715.24s]  When do you jump off of this?
[4715.24s -> 4716.44s]  Oh, just watch.
[4716.44s -> 4716.68s]  Okay.
[4716.68s -> 4719.16s]  Look forward and hold A or D while jumping wall to wall.
[4720.28s -> 4720.60s]  Really?
[4720.60s -> 4721.08s]  Yes.
[4721.08s -> 4721.64s]  Keep sprinting.
[4723.95s -> 4724.51s]  That's true.
[4724.51s -> 4725.23s]  They got it.
[4725.23s -> 4725.95s]  Hey, you got to hold.
[4725.95s -> 4729.45s]  Oh, okay.
[4729.45s -> 4730.81s]  Well, zombies are here now.
[4731.85s -> 4733.82s]  Oh, I'm dead.
[4733.82s -> 4737.60s]  Somebody save me.
[4737.60s -> 4738.40s]  Somebody save me.
[4738.40s -> 4740.24s]  They'll lose the best gun in the whole game.
[4740.80s -> 4741.61s]  I got him.
[4741.61s -> 4744.70s]  Does everyone have a little more fun?
[4744.70s -> 4746.22s]  Yeah.
[4746.22s -> 4748.14s]  This is big fun, man.
[4748.14s -> 4748.86s]  This is big fun.
[4749.98s -> 4751.02s]  And you want another drink?
[4751.02s -> 4751.58s]  What should I do?
[4751.58s -> 4753.02s]  I have $2,700.
[4753.02s -> 4753.82s]  Is that my money?
[4753.82s -> 4754.46s]  Where's my money?
[4754.46s -> 4755.18s]  Bend it on the juice.
[4757.16s -> 4758.12s]  Replace the pistol.
[4758.12s -> 4759.16s]  People are screaming at me.
[4761.80s -> 4762.44s]  I don't know.
[4762.44s -> 4763.96s]  I've never played it before.
[4764.92s -> 4767.40s]  We can get a crawler and then we can just keep fucking trying.
[4767.40s -> 4769.96s]  Yeah, that's the high level strategy.
[4769.96s -> 4770.20s]  Yeah.
[4772.48s -> 4773.44s]  Buy the juice.
[4774.56s -> 4775.60s]  Yeah, buy the juice.
[4775.60s -> 4776.24s]  Is this juice?
[4777.20s -> 4779.84s]  You're going to want to get the juggernaut one.
[4779.84s -> 4781.36s]  Yeah, get the juggernaut juice.
[4781.36s -> 4782.40s]  I don't know.
[4782.40s -> 4783.44s]  Was that the juggernaut one?
[4783.44s -> 4784.96s]  What brand did I just drink?
[4784.96s -> 4785.92s]  It's red.
[4785.92s -> 4786.48s]  Yeah, it's red.
[4786.48s -> 4788.64s]  I want an off-brand Stamina right there.
[4788.64s -> 4790.08s]  Was that an off-brand Stamina drink?
[4790.08s -> 4792.40s]  Yeah, that was a store brand right there.
[4794.72s -> 4795.22s]  Uh-oh.
[4795.84s -> 4796.88s]  I think I found juggernaut.
[4796.88s -> 4799.52s]  It's back here by Raccoon Mario.
[4799.52s -> 4801.04s]  Replace pistol.
[4801.04s -> 4802.16s]  Replace pistol.
[4802.16s -> 4802.96s]  I'm sorry.
[4803.76s -> 4805.55s]  Raccoon Mario.
[4805.55s -> 4806.67s]  Oh, yeah.
[4806.67s -> 4815.34s]  How much is this?
[4816.20s -> 4817.16s]  Here we go.
[4817.16s -> 4818.36s]  It's like 2,500, I think.
[4818.36s -> 4819.16s]  Oh, all right.
[4819.16s -> 4821.24s]  Oh, that's 950.
[4823.18s -> 4825.82s]  Okay, he just got one of the other best guns in the game right there.
[4825.82s -> 4828.86s]  I just watched him on stream get one of the best guns.
[4828.86s -> 4829.42s]  What did he get?
[4829.42s -> 4830.78s]  What the fuck is this shit?
[4830.78s -> 4831.28s]  What?
[4831.98s -> 4832.48s]  What?
[4834.54s -> 4835.76s]  What did he get?
[4835.76s -> 4836.40s]  I don't know.
[4836.40s -> 4836.88s]  Let me...
[4836.88s -> 4839.52s]  He's got like some dual-wheeled laser beam shit.
[4839.52s -> 4841.76s]  GKZ-45 MK3?
[4841.76s -> 4842.26s]  No!
[4843.06s -> 4844.29s]  I mean, it looks cool.
[4844.29s -> 4846.45s]  I am a god.
[4846.45s -> 4848.37s]  How do you keep making this fucking jump?
[4848.37s -> 4849.33s]  Oh, crack and fell.
[4849.33s -> 4850.13s]  Learn to wall run.
[4850.93s -> 4852.86s]  Oh, I can't see.
[4852.86s -> 4853.66s]  I'm trying, dude.
[4854.94s -> 4855.98s]  I actually fucking...
[4855.98s -> 4856.48s]  Oh!
[4857.81s -> 4858.69s]  No, no, no.
[4858.69s -> 4859.65s]  I don't like this gun.
[4861.41s -> 4863.09s]  I found the same exact spot.
[4863.73s -> 4864.61s]  Whoa, what was that?
[4864.61s -> 4865.09s]  I don't know.
[4865.09s -> 4866.77s]  It's my new weapon that I locked up.
[4866.77s -> 4867.97s]  What? You got a black hole gun?
[4867.97s -> 4869.57s]  I got a black hole gun.
[4869.57s -> 4871.57s]  Of course, the guy that doesn't know what to do gets it.
[4872.85s -> 4873.73s]  Did you just fall?
[4873.81s -> 4874.21s]  Just now?
[4874.21s -> 4874.85s]  Yeah.
[4874.85s -> 4875.81s]  Yeah, I walked right off.
[4877.97s -> 4879.81s]  But I got stamina up so I can run forever.
[4881.18s -> 4881.98s]  No, I was there.
[4881.98s -> 4882.94s]  Oh, really?
[4882.94s -> 4883.74s]  I should do that, too.
[4883.74s -> 4884.46s]  That was pretty close.
[4884.46s -> 4886.21s]  That's actually a good idea.
[4886.21s -> 4887.49s]  Are we losing money for doing this?
[4887.49s -> 4888.29s]  Oh, baby.
[4889.01s -> 4889.81s]  Oh, baby.
[4891.38s -> 4892.18s]  Oh, come on.
[4893.14s -> 4893.86s]  Oh, my god.
[4893.86s -> 4894.50s]  I'm so bad.
[4895.30s -> 4899.89s]  There's only two zombies.
[4899.89s -> 4900.53s]  No!
[4900.53s -> 4901.41s]  What happened?
[4901.41s -> 4902.37s]  Never mind the pain.
[4903.33s -> 4904.21s]  Don't kill the zombies,
[4904.21s -> 4905.25s]  because then the round goes...
[4907.25s -> 4908.37s]  What am I doing wrong?
[4909.25s -> 4910.29s]  Don't kill the zombies.
[4911.81s -> 4913.25s]  I actually got hurt just now.
[4913.25s -> 4913.57s]  I don't know.
[4913.57s -> 4914.69s]  Don't hurt that one.
[4914.69s -> 4914.85s]  What?
[4914.85s -> 4915.49s]  Don't hurt that...
[4915.49s -> 4916.21s]  No!
[4916.21s -> 4916.53s]  Why?
[4916.53s -> 4917.09s]  What's wrong?
[4918.61s -> 4919.57s]  It's a new round.
[4919.57s -> 4921.73s]  What do you mean it's a new round?
[4921.73s -> 4922.37s]  It's all right,
[4922.37s -> 4924.77s]  because you got a new guy on the team, hey.
[4924.77s -> 4925.49s]  Oh, he's here.
[4926.37s -> 4927.01s]  It's me.
[4927.01s -> 4927.41s]  I'm here.
[4928.45s -> 4929.65s]  Do you know how to wall jump, Tomato?
[4930.77s -> 4932.69s]  Oh, now there's 56 of them.
[4932.69s -> 4934.05s]  I don't even know how to get to you
[4934.05s -> 4935.01s]  if we're going to be real.
[4936.21s -> 4936.77s]  Where am I?
[4936.77s -> 4938.05s]  Did you not spawn right on us?
[4938.85s -> 4939.89s]  No, I spawned like...
[4940.45s -> 4943.73s]  I'm pretty close to T-posing cloud turtle,
[4943.73s -> 4944.45s]  more than anything.
[4945.73s -> 4946.53s]  Oh, look.
[4946.53s -> 4946.69s]  Yeah.
[4946.69s -> 4947.49s]  Oh, yeah.
[4947.49s -> 4948.61s]  I may be making a mistake.
[4948.61s -> 4949.01s]  Oh, yeah.
[4949.01s -> 4949.41s]  Oh, yeah.
[4949.97s -> 4950.29s]  Fuck.
[4951.17s -> 4952.08s]  Sorry, guys.
[4952.08s -> 4954.48s]  My first ever experience in Cod Zombies
[4954.48s -> 4957.28s]  is Mario meme Bowser T-pose map.
[4958.16s -> 4959.68s]  I don't have time to understand.
[4959.68s -> 4961.28s]  And fucking wall run parkour.
[4961.28s -> 4963.90s]  Oh, I keep getting to the end.
[4963.90s -> 4964.30s]  I made it.
[4964.30s -> 4965.34s]  What the fuck?
[4965.34s -> 4967.15s]  I made it to the end.
[4967.15s -> 4968.19s]  Oh, what does that do?
[4969.71s -> 4970.11s]  Nothing.
[4970.11s -> 4970.91s]  There's Wario.
[4971.79s -> 4972.19s]  What?
[4973.87s -> 4974.43s]  That's it.
[4974.43s -> 4974.91s]  Get ready.
[4974.91s -> 4976.59s]  I'm about to pull this off in one go.
[4977.63s -> 4979.30s]  You guys should hurry up and get over here.
[4979.30s -> 4980.18s]  I don't have any guns.
[4981.06s -> 4982.50s]  Can you guys Luigi me over there?
[4983.30s -> 4983.86s]  What?
[4983.86s -> 4984.66s]  Luigi me?
[4984.66s -> 4985.22s]  Yeah, just like...
[4985.94s -> 4987.38s]  Luigi just does it for you
[4987.38s -> 4988.50s]  in Mario 3D world.
[4991.92s -> 4993.04s]  Oh, oh.
[4993.68s -> 4994.32s]  I don't...
[4994.32s -> 4995.36s]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[4995.36s -> 4996.32s]  That last one I can't get.
[4996.32s -> 4996.72s]  Oh, my God.
[4996.72s -> 4997.60s]  We're going to die.
[4997.60s -> 4998.00s]  I'm dead.
[4999.20s -> 4999.84s]  No.
[4999.84s -> 5000.96s]  You're my mirror town.
[5002.18s -> 5002.50s]  What?
[5002.58s -> 5003.22s]  Keep them off me.
[5003.22s -> 5004.74s]  I'm going to get you out of there.
[5004.74s -> 5005.46s]  Oh, God.
[5006.74s -> 5008.35s]  I'm going to get you out of there.
[5008.35s -> 5008.91s]  Can I do it?
[5010.19s -> 5010.99s]  Keep him off of me.
[5010.99s -> 5012.27s]  Keep the one off of me.
[5012.27s -> 5013.23s]  Yeah, we're doing it.
[5015.98s -> 5018.94s]  Oh, I don't know what's happening.
[5018.94s -> 5019.58s]  I revived.
[5019.58s -> 5020.78s]  Please don't make me go back
[5020.78s -> 5021.98s]  to that fucking other area.
[5021.98s -> 5023.34s]  I got you.
[5023.34s -> 5023.82s]  Go back.
[5024.62s -> 5026.38s]  Yeah, we're fine.
[5026.38s -> 5027.58s]  Why don't you pick me up?
[5028.22s -> 5029.26s]  I was trying to get to you.
[5029.26s -> 5031.18s]  Two men zombies pushed me out of the way.
[5031.18s -> 5031.74s]  I got you.
[5031.74s -> 5032.14s]  Don't worry.
[5032.14s -> 5033.26s]  German's distracted.
[5033.26s -> 5034.06s]  He just ran off.
[5034.70s -> 5035.34s]  No, I'm all right.
[5035.34s -> 5036.06s]  I'm all right.
[5036.06s -> 5037.18s]  There's nine zombies left.
[5038.69s -> 5039.17s]  What?
[5039.17s -> 5039.81s]  Pick me up.
[5040.45s -> 5041.41s]  But I don't want to get killed.
[5042.13s -> 5042.69s]  No, not me.
[5042.69s -> 5043.49s]  I died.
[5043.49s -> 5043.97s]  He's dead.
[5043.97s -> 5044.37s]  What?
[5044.37s -> 5044.61s]  No.
[5044.61s -> 5044.93s]  Wait.
[5044.93s -> 5045.41s]  You can die?
[5046.13s -> 5046.77s]  Oh, no.
[5046.77s -> 5047.89s]  I didn't know you could die.
[5047.89s -> 5049.41s]  There's only eight zombies left.
[5050.61s -> 5051.89s]  They're getting awfully close.
[5053.09s -> 5055.01s]  I didn't know you could actually perma die.
[5055.65s -> 5057.01s]  I thought if we all died.
[5057.01s -> 5059.25s]  Well, eventually he'll come back.
[5059.25s -> 5060.93s]  We'll come back in another black hole.
[5061.89s -> 5064.21s]  But he won't have his guns anymore.
[5064.45s -> 5066.21s]  I like slow games like pick Ross.
[5067.17s -> 5068.56s]  Sudoku.
[5068.56s -> 5069.20s]  All right.
[5069.20s -> 5070.56s]  I have I'm ready.
[5070.56s -> 5072.80s]  I'm ready to like switch over and take over the
[5072.80s -> 5074.72s]  the curating duty for this like stream.
[5074.72s -> 5075.28s]  Wait.
[5075.28s -> 5076.16s]  James is almost at Peach.
[5076.72s -> 5077.76s]  Yeah, I'm at Peach, dude.
[5077.76s -> 5079.04s]  I see T posing Peach.
[5079.04s -> 5080.16s]  How much do you need for that?
[5080.16s -> 5081.36s]  I need more money.
[5081.36s -> 5081.86s]  How much?
[5083.12s -> 5084.08s]  It's 3000.
[5084.08s -> 5085.68s]  I have 1700.
[5085.68s -> 5086.16s]  You can do it.
[5087.52s -> 5088.48s]  I can get the Peach.
[5088.48s -> 5090.96s]  I always say if we get to Peach, then we win.
[5090.96s -> 5091.36s]  How about that?
[5091.36s -> 5092.24s]  What else is called that?
[5092.24s -> 5092.74s]  I made it.
[5092.74s -> 5096.45s]  Oh, yeah, it was over here, too.
[5097.33s -> 5099.04s]  We just need the money.
[5099.04s -> 5100.08s]  We don't have enough money to do this.
[5100.08s -> 5101.76s]  How much money is it?
[5101.76s -> 5102.48s]  It's 3000.
[5106.45s -> 5109.17s]  I can make us the money, but I need someone said to shoot
[5109.17s -> 5110.37s]  the teddy bears that are hidden.
[5111.49s -> 5113.41s]  Oh, I saw one of those hidden teddy bears.
[5113.41s -> 5113.97s]  Really?
[5113.97s -> 5114.93s]  I just shot one.
[5114.93s -> 5116.05s]  I just shot one.
[5116.05s -> 5117.41s]  What the fuck does that do?
[5117.41s -> 5118.29s]  Yeah, just got one.
[5119.17s -> 5120.37s]  We can't pull our money together.
[5121.65s -> 5124.76s]  No, this isn't a cooperative game.
[5125.64s -> 5131.91s]  Oh, man, that last jump is.
[5131.91s -> 5132.23s]  I know.
[5132.23s -> 5133.27s]  I keep falling there.
[5133.27s -> 5133.67s]  I don't know.
[5133.67s -> 5134.47s]  That last jump.
[5134.47s -> 5134.87s]  The angle.
[5135.59s -> 5137.57s]  This is a boss wave incoming.
[5137.57s -> 5138.77s]  How can you jump?
[5138.77s -> 5141.73s]  This map was just shitty and intriguing enough for you guys
[5141.73s -> 5145.17s]  to kill just enough time for my entire download to pretty much finish,
[5145.17s -> 5146.29s]  which was very nice of you.
[5148.55s -> 5150.02s]  Oh, this is so fun.
[5150.02s -> 5153.46s]  So whenever we're sick of this one, we can move on to something.
[5153.46s -> 5156.26s]  It's more so whether or not we're going to be sick of you guys trying this jump.
[5156.26s -> 5157.70s]  Hurry the fuck up and make it.
[5157.70s -> 5158.18s]  Oh, my God.
[5158.18s -> 5159.78s]  Why are you waiting for me?
[5159.78s -> 5160.34s]  I'm dead.
[5161.22s -> 5161.38s]  What?
[5161.38s -> 5161.78s]  You're dead?
[5162.34s -> 5163.14s]  Yeah, German left me.
[5165.14s -> 5165.70s]  But he made it.
[5165.70s -> 5166.42s]  Okay, I'm here.
[5166.42s -> 5167.30s]  Are you happy?
[5167.30s -> 5168.10s]  Jesus.
[5168.98s -> 5170.50s]  We got to kill the last four zombies.
[5170.50s -> 5171.70s]  They were way back there.
[5173.22s -> 5173.46s]  No.
[5174.74s -> 5176.66s]  No, there's got to be a way for them to follow us.
[5176.66s -> 5176.98s]  Nope.
[5176.98s -> 5177.70s]  You got to go back.
[5178.90s -> 5180.82s]  I think they come through this blue door.
[5181.94s -> 5182.68s]  Don't worry, guys.
[5182.68s -> 5186.28s]  I think that mapmaker had the foresight to build that mechanic into this.
[5186.28s -> 5187.96s]  Maybe, because you can't do anything with this shit.
[5187.96s -> 5191.88s]  If he had the time to make it when I buy a gun, it makes a coin ding sound,
[5191.88s -> 5195.33s]  then I'm going to guess there's at least a little bit of thought.
[5195.33s -> 5196.69s]  Okay, I need to kill four zombies.
[5198.36s -> 5201.72s]  Wait, is that Yoshi looking at Yoshi's own skeleton?
[5201.72s -> 5201.96s]  Yeah.
[5201.96s -> 5202.68s]  I'll be ready.
[5202.68s -> 5203.32s]  That's...
[5203.32s -> 5203.72s]  I'm here.
[5205.08s -> 5205.72s]  Okay, they're coming.
[5207.16s -> 5208.68s]  All right, now I just need to get to you easy.
[5209.24s -> 5209.72s]  Where are you?
[5210.76s -> 5211.80s]  At the spot that spawn.
[5211.80s -> 5212.92s]  Okay, well, here comes another wave.
[5214.32s -> 5215.12s]  All right.
[5215.12s -> 5216.16s]  I'm here with you, though.
[5217.12s -> 5217.44s]  Oh, yeah.
[5217.44s -> 5219.28s]  One of us is going to get enough money to get to Peach.
[5219.84s -> 5220.40s]  Dogs left.
[5220.40s -> 5221.20s]  Are you going to be okay?
[5222.24s -> 5223.04s]  It's dogs.
[5223.04s -> 5224.08s]  Oh, wait, you went all the way back?
[5224.08s -> 5224.72s]  Oh, yeah.
[5224.72s -> 5226.48s]  I came back to kill the zombie.
[5226.48s -> 5226.88s]  Okay.
[5228.00s -> 5228.80s]  You get out of here.
[5228.80s -> 5229.28s]  It's all right.
[5231.12s -> 5231.84s]  I'll get there.
[5232.88s -> 5238.32s]  James, do you have like good like sodas, like juggernaut?
[5238.32s -> 5239.20s]  Do you have anything fancy?
[5239.20s -> 5239.84s]  Oh, no.
[5239.84s -> 5241.60s]  I've got juggernaut and the stamina one.
[5242.16s -> 5244.88s]  Okay, then you just stand in front of me and catch all the dog mouths.
[5244.88s -> 5245.28s]  All right.
[5245.92s -> 5246.64s]  Bad dog.
[5248.32s -> 5249.36s]  I just bought a nice gun.
[5249.36s -> 5250.24s]  I don't have anything else.
[5252.56s -> 5252.96s]  All right.
[5252.96s -> 5253.52s]  Where are you?
[5253.52s -> 5253.92s]  Here we go.
[5255.52s -> 5257.04s]  Let me know if they spawn back here.
[5257.76s -> 5258.40s]  Yeah, I got you.
[5259.84s -> 5263.86s]  Now, this is that Black Ops co-op gameplay.
[5263.86s -> 5266.10s]  I was really seeking out when I conned you all.
[5266.10s -> 5268.82s]  They just the dog just went through that blue portal door thing.
[5268.82s -> 5269.86s]  Whatever the fuck that is.
[5269.86s -> 5270.26s]  I did it.
[5270.82s -> 5271.14s]  I'm here.
[5271.14s -> 5272.50s]  He did program that shit.
[5273.62s -> 5274.74s]  You sold him short.
[5275.86s -> 5276.18s]  Oh, yeah.
[5276.18s -> 5276.90s]  No, it's coming in.
[5277.54s -> 5277.94s]  You good?
[5278.90s -> 5281.03s]  It's good.
[5281.03s -> 5282.15s]  He's just going to do the jump.
[5282.15s -> 5286.07s]  Oh, intense, intense.
[5286.07s -> 5286.55s]  Nice, guys.
[5286.55s -> 5286.79s]  Nice.
[5286.79s -> 5287.19s]  Nice.
[5287.19s -> 5288.71s]  Reload your guns, boys.
[5288.71s -> 5289.83s]  I'm like shaking right now.
[5289.83s -> 5290.87s]  Black Ops things.
[5290.87s -> 5291.27s]  Damn it.
[5293.11s -> 5295.83s]  You still don't have enough money to get through to the fucking peach.
[5297.65s -> 5298.29s]  Someone's close.
[5298.29s -> 5299.57s]  Someone's got to 2,400.
[5299.57s -> 5300.45s]  That's me.
[5300.45s -> 5300.77s]  Who is?
[5300.77s -> 5301.25s]  Yeah, who is?
[5301.25s -> 5301.81s]  You have 2,400?
[5302.53s -> 5302.93s]  Yeah.
[5302.93s -> 5303.25s]  Wow.
[5303.25s -> 5304.05s]  I love this.
[5304.05s -> 5305.25s]  I love the framing of this.
[5305.25s -> 5306.85s]  You see peach desperate for help.
[5306.93s -> 5310.13s]  And right above it is a YouTube ad for someone's channel.
[5310.77s -> 5312.69s]  Right above that is Mario.
[5312.69s -> 5314.13s]  And above that is a castle.
[5314.13s -> 5318.37s]  And above that is Bowser juggling boobs, I think.
[5319.89s -> 5321.25s]  Oh, I thought you said juggling boobs.
[5321.25s -> 5323.81s]  I was like, you guys have been talking about boobs for like 45 minutes.
[5323.81s -> 5324.77s]  The boob viewer prompts.
[5326.07s -> 5326.47s]  No.
[5327.35s -> 5328.55s]  Oh, fuck off.
[5328.55s -> 5329.27s]  Cock.
[5329.27s -> 5329.77s]  Cock.
[5330.95s -> 5332.39s]  Look at this meta here.
[5333.35s -> 5335.83s]  They're trying to tell a story here with this mirror.
[5336.31s -> 5338.02s]  I got enough.
[5338.58s -> 5339.94s]  James is almost there.
[5339.94s -> 5340.18s]  What?
[5340.18s -> 5345.22s]  I'll wait until the pack is a little bit more lower down, I guess.
[5345.22s -> 5345.78s]  Oh, my God.
[5345.78s -> 5346.26s]  What the fuck?
[5347.30s -> 5348.74s]  Is that the waffle gun?
[5348.74s -> 5350.42s]  Yeah, I kind of can't lose.
[5351.14s -> 5351.62s]  Wait, crack.
[5351.62s -> 5352.50s]  I'm going to break down.
[5352.50s -> 5353.54s]  You're incredibly powerful.
[5353.54s -> 5354.02s]  Yeah, I'm dead.
[5354.02s -> 5354.50s]  It's all right.
[5354.50s -> 5355.14s]  You guys have fun.
[5355.14s -> 5356.58s]  I'm going to watch the peach part.
[5358.74s -> 5360.26s]  You're going to watch the peach part?
[5360.26s -> 5361.46s]  Yeah, I'm a viewer now.
[5361.46s -> 5361.86s]  It's cool.
[5363.14s -> 5364.10s]  I can come back and get you.
[5364.10s -> 5365.30s]  I don't have anything to lose.
[5365.30s -> 5366.82s]  I mean, now I'm out of time, I think.
[5367.54s -> 5368.50s]  No, I can try.
[5368.50s -> 5371.00s]  No, that's not right.
[5371.00s -> 5372.76s]  We've made the necessary amount of money.
[5373.72s -> 5375.00s]  Okay, I'm watching.
[5375.00s -> 5375.72s]  Oh, my God.
[5377.80s -> 5378.44s]  Go get peach.
[5379.84s -> 5381.20s]  I have a black hole gun, too.
[5383.43s -> 5386.15s]  I don't understand how you got every gun in the game.
[5387.43s -> 5389.27s]  I kind of just, yeah, I typed in the console.
[5398.34s -> 5400.42s]  I am looking forward to what this payoff is going to be.
[5400.42s -> 5402.34s]  If there even will be any payoff.
[5402.34s -> 5402.98s]  Payoff?
[5402.98s -> 5404.18s]  Is there any payoff?
[5404.26s -> 5405.06s]  Will there be payoff?
[5405.06s -> 5406.10s]  No.
[5406.10s -> 5406.50s]  No?
[5406.50s -> 5411.22s]  In a mod map of Halloween, Mario, you're shooting a payoff.
[5413.06s -> 5413.38s]  No.
[5415.14s -> 5415.70s]  Okay, I'm fine.
[5416.34s -> 5417.22s]  What the fuck?
[5417.22s -> 5417.46s]  What?
[5419.83s -> 5420.47s]  Go get peach.
[5422.20s -> 5422.60s]  It's time.
[5423.81s -> 5424.45s]  4,000.
[5425.89s -> 5426.21s]  Wait.
[5427.20s -> 5427.60s]  Wait, what?
[5427.60s -> 5428.96s]  It should be 3,000.
[5428.96s -> 5429.76s]  No, it's 3,000.
[5429.76s -> 5430.72s]  The other one is 4,000.
[5430.72s -> 5431.36s]  It's 3,000.
[5431.36s -> 5432.56s]  You want me to do it?
[5432.56s -> 5433.36s]  Yeah, I guess.
[5433.36s -> 5434.64s]  I'll get the next one.
[5434.64s -> 5435.36s]  Peach.
[5435.36s -> 5436.96s]  Oh, the pack of punches here.
[5436.96s -> 5437.60s]  What does that do?
[5438.40s -> 5438.96s]  5,000.
[5438.96s -> 5440.00s]  Wait, upgrade your weapon.
[5441.12s -> 5441.68s]  Oh, shoot.
[5441.68s -> 5443.28s]  I can upgrade my starter pistol.
[5443.28s -> 5445.36s]  This is one of the coolest things you can do in the whole game.
[5445.36s -> 5447.76s]  Wait, rescue peach is only 3,000?
[5447.76s -> 5448.24s]  No, it's-
[5448.24s -> 5449.44s]  No, it's 43,000.
[5449.44s -> 5451.20s]  43,000.
[5451.20s -> 5452.88s]  43,000.
[5452.88s -> 5453.36s]  No.
[5453.36s -> 5454.96s]  The fucking rescue peach.
[5455.60s -> 5457.68s]  That means we have to play for like six hours.
[5457.68s -> 5458.64s]  I could keep on saving up some more money.
[5458.64s -> 5459.68s]  I don't want to do that.
[5461.36s -> 5463.04s]  That's like six hours of gameplay.
[5465.12s -> 5466.72s]  I just killed everybody in one shot.
[5467.60s -> 5470.08s]  I'm going to pack a punch to the starter pistol,
[5470.08s -> 5471.60s]  which is a wacky part of the game.
[5472.80s -> 5474.32s]  You get the starting pistol.
[5474.32s -> 5475.92s]  Hey, that scared the shit out of me.
[5477.36s -> 5478.00s]  I don't know why.
[5479.12s -> 5480.16s]  I shoot grenades.
[5483.27s -> 5485.11s]  Hey, you guys want to give up?
[5485.11s -> 5487.43s]  Hey, you know those other like 75 maps?
[5487.43s -> 5491.43s]  Yeah, I got like 70 other smooth maps we can shoot if you guys want.
[5491.43s -> 5491.75s]  Yeah.
[5492.39s -> 5493.67s]  You don't want to rescue peach.
[5493.67s -> 5494.15s]  What?
[5494.15s -> 5494.65s]  No.
[5496.63s -> 5497.99s]  We did not rescue peach.
[5498.39s -> 5502.15s]  You know, it's like a to-be-continued scenario.
[5504.26s -> 5505.30s]  But we're so close.
[5505.30s -> 5505.94s]  You're losing out, man.
[5505.94s -> 5508.82s]  I guess you could always see the ending on that dude's YouTube channel.
[5508.82s -> 5509.62s]  Oh, you're right.
[5510.34s -> 5511.22s]  Dude.
[5511.22s -> 5512.58s]  Shout out, you always win.
[5512.58s -> 5513.54s]  You always win.
[5515.09s -> 5516.93s]  That's not a bad YouTube channel name.
[5516.93s -> 5518.29s]  That's a pretty good name.
[5518.29s -> 5520.85s]  That was definitely an early like 2000 name.
[5520.85s -> 5525.00s]  I can't remember if I downloaded a bunch of his maps
[5525.00s -> 5527.40s]  because I thought they all looked like trash garbage or not.
[5528.60s -> 5531.56s]  There were definitely a couple people that I went through their entire catalog grabbing
[5531.56s -> 5532.76s]  maps because I was like, oh, fuck.
[5533.64s -> 5534.52s]  He's like, all right.
[5534.52s -> 5536.92s]  So do I make you the you win, you lose.
[5536.92s -> 5537.64s]  You always win.
[5538.76s -> 5540.36s]  I don't know if you can make me the leader.
[5540.36s -> 5541.80s]  Yeah, I don't know either.
[5541.80s -> 5543.32s]  Do you want to tell me which map to pick?
[5543.32s -> 5544.28s]  Or do you have a?
[5544.28s -> 5547.88s]  Yeah, I'll back out and tell you which one to pick next.
[5547.88s -> 5549.32s]  Okay, why are you back out?
[5549.32s -> 5552.04s]  Because I that way I can know which maps are still downloading for me
[5552.04s -> 5553.24s]  and which ones are done.
[5553.24s -> 5553.56s]  Okay.
[5554.12s -> 5556.12s]  Because there's still a couple of them pushing through.
[5558.23s -> 5561.43s]  Let's do you guys want to do a real map?
[5561.43s -> 5562.87s]  Do you want to do another shit take?
[5563.43s -> 5564.87s]  Because that's what it boils down to.
[5564.87s -> 5565.67s]  We could just kind of roll.
[5566.47s -> 5567.91s]  What do you consider to be a real map?
[5569.03s -> 5573.83s]  There are real decent maps like that Binding of Isaac one is actually a decent map.
[5573.83s -> 5574.15s]  Really?
[5574.15s -> 5576.71s]  Like stuff like A Christmas Carol, which is a decent map.
[5576.71s -> 5582.31s]  Then there's ones like Pokemon Sun Slash Moon, which I can assure you is a shit map.
[5582.31s -> 5584.15s]  And Taco Bell, which is shit.
[5584.15s -> 5585.35s]  I think one sounds pretty cool.
[5585.35s -> 5586.63s]  There's zombies and cars.
[5586.63s -> 5588.39s]  Mario Kart Edition where you drive cars.
[5589.35s -> 5592.98s]  Oh, so this is going to be a throw up stream.
[5593.62s -> 5594.02s]  Yeah.
[5594.02s -> 5595.54s]  Yeah, I don't drive car.
[5595.54s -> 5597.06s]  I doubt to do after birth.
[5597.06s -> 5598.66s]  That one sounds okay.
[5598.66s -> 5599.54s]  That one can't fail.
[5601.06s -> 5604.66s]  It's Isaac and it's actually got like challenges and like the proper rooms
[5604.66s -> 5606.26s]  and you get rewards in the right rooms.
[5606.26s -> 5607.54s]  It's all okay.
[5607.54s -> 5609.22s]  It's all like that one's a legit.
[5609.22s -> 5610.18s]  Okay, cool.
[5610.18s -> 5611.14s]  Yeah, let's do it.
[5614.02s -> 5614.74s]  Sorry, bless me.
[5614.74s -> 5617.14s]  That's not like somebody grabbed you in the back of the head and need you and think
[5617.78s -> 5620.10s]  Yeah, that was like, but bang.
[5624.37s -> 5624.69s]  Thank you.
[5624.69s -> 5625.09s]  Crack it.
[5627.49s -> 5635.49s]  We lose somebody.
[5635.49s -> 5635.89s]  Sorry.
[5635.89s -> 5636.69s]  Oh, there we go.
[5636.69s -> 5637.49s]  Oh, you disappeared.
[5637.49s -> 5637.65s]  Yeah.
[5638.85s -> 5640.29s]  Oh, I can read.
[5640.29s -> 5642.85s]  I can join mid game if you guys just start loading.
[5642.85s -> 5645.41s]  I'll join while it's loading too much data.
[5645.41s -> 5645.81s]  There we go.
[5645.81s -> 5646.29s]  There it goes.
[5648.79s -> 5650.47s]  After this, we'll do Candyland.
[5651.19s -> 5651.75s]  Candyland.
[5654.31s -> 5655.35s]  Candyland.
[5656.15s -> 5657.43s]  I'd like to do Monopoly again.
[5658.98s -> 5660.42s]  Yeah, I'm curious about Monopoly too.
[5660.42s -> 5661.70s]  Do you actually play Monopoly?
[5662.34s -> 5665.64s]  Do we have to actually place Monopoly?
[5665.64s -> 5667.00s]  Or are you asking in the game?
[5669.00s -> 5673.56s]  I think you make money by killing the zombies and then you pay to move the dice.
[5673.56s -> 5673.96s]  Oh, yeah.
[5675.48s -> 5677.48s]  It costs zombie points to move your dice.
[5680.44s -> 5681.00s]  It's a mess.
[5681.00s -> 5683.80s]  It's like it's rough at the very beginning too because they're going to move.
[5684.76s -> 5687.24s]  What the fuck?
[5687.24s -> 5687.72s]  What?
[5688.44s -> 5688.76s]  Whoa.
[5689.48s -> 5692.12s]  They even have the Isaac font and everything.
[5692.84s -> 5693.80s]  Dude, I told you.
[5693.80s -> 5695.64s]  I picked out some actual mods.
[5697.78s -> 5699.06s]  Oh, man, if you go into your graphics,
[5699.06s -> 5702.02s]  it changes all the font and like the menus too and everything.
[5702.02s -> 5702.66s]  Oh, that's cool.
[5704.50s -> 5704.82s]  Nice.
[5706.82s -> 5707.70s]  Oh, knife only.
[5707.70s -> 5708.18s]  I'm sorry.
[5712.61s -> 5713.73s]  Host kick noob.
[5713.73s -> 5714.93s]  Not knifeing first round.
[5717.01s -> 5719.33s]  I'm trying to help you guys out to get further here.
[5719.89s -> 5721.01s]  And I say, fuck you guys.
[5721.01s -> 5721.81s]  You guys are idiots.
[5721.81s -> 5722.45s]  And you booed me.
[5724.85s -> 5731.43s]  Okay, so my eye-catcher actually looks like me.
[5731.43s -> 5731.99s]  What the fuck?
[5732.63s -> 5733.03s]  It does.
[5733.83s -> 5734.79s]  What the fuck?
[5734.79s -> 5735.67s]  Does that mine look like me?
[5735.67s -> 5736.23s]  Knife only.
[5739.68s -> 5740.00s]  Okay.
[5741.75s -> 5742.71s]  Do we need the music?
[5743.27s -> 5744.55s]  We like the music, right?
[5744.55s -> 5746.31s]  I think I want to turn it off.
[5746.31s -> 5747.35s]  It's all right.
[5747.35s -> 5748.39s]  It's quite ominous.
[5748.39s -> 5748.87s]  I like it.
[5749.83s -> 5750.63s]  Quick revive.
[5752.02s -> 5753.38s]  I'm going to open this door.
[5753.38s -> 5754.98s]  So do you pick a door to go through?
[5754.98s -> 5756.42s]  Or is 2000 going to open this door?
[5757.30s -> 5758.02s]  Come forward.
[5758.02s -> 5758.58s]  Who's got 2000?
[5758.58s -> 5759.70s]  That's crikey.
[5759.70s -> 5760.74s]  I will open.
[5762.85s -> 5763.89s]  Whoa, there's a chest.
[5764.53s -> 5764.77s]  Cool.
[5765.57s -> 5766.37s]  It's randomizing.
[5767.09s -> 5768.28s]  What did we get?
[5769.44s -> 5769.76s]  Nothing.
[5770.48s -> 5771.12s]  Nothing here.
[5771.12s -> 5772.08s]  There's nothing in that chest.
[5773.68s -> 5774.40s]  It's alive.
[5775.12s -> 5776.16s]  We need a key, I think.
[5776.16s -> 5777.52s]  I think we actually need to get a key.
[5779.84s -> 5781.28s]  Hey, and now we wipe and die.
[5782.08s -> 5782.64s]  It's happening.
[5782.64s -> 5783.04s]  No.
[5784.08s -> 5785.20s]  Is it still knife only?
[5786.00s -> 5787.04s]  I got a knife.
[5791.92s -> 5793.92s]  Now it's only knife only if we have insta-kill.
[5793.92s -> 5795.04s]  We all take turns opening doors.
[5795.04s -> 5796.72s]  We do have insta-kill.
[5796.72s -> 5798.72s]  So if we have insta-kill, it's knife only.
[5798.72s -> 5800.96s]  Don't have insta-kill, shoot him.
[5800.96s -> 5801.52s]  All right.
[5801.52s -> 5802.72s]  Who's opening this one?
[5802.72s -> 5803.52s]  Who's the rich one?
[5804.32s -> 5805.04s]  It opened up.
[5805.04s -> 5805.76s]  How did it open?
[5806.40s -> 5807.52s]  Oh, how did it open?
[5808.08s -> 5812.24s]  Oh, we got weapon box.
[5812.24s -> 5812.64s]  That's good.
[5813.28s -> 5814.88s]  How much did this cost money?
[5814.88s -> 5816.80s]  Give me the treasure.
[5816.80s -> 5818.48s]  Whoa, what the fuck was...
[5818.48s -> 5819.44s]  Did you guys see that thing?
[5820.88s -> 5823.52s]  There was some sort of goblin monster in the box.
[5826.80s -> 5827.36s]  Oh, no.
[5828.72s -> 5828.96s]  Hey.
[5828.96s -> 5829.44s]  Are we bad?
[5829.44s -> 5829.84s]  Are we bad?
[5830.72s -> 5831.76s]  I think we're bad, gang.
[5835.14s -> 5836.66s]  That grenade just saved our lives.
[5836.66s -> 5837.30s]  I can do this.
[5838.02s -> 5838.58s]  Oh, God.
[5838.58s -> 5839.54s]  I can't.
[5839.54s -> 5840.02s]  Get us.
[5840.82s -> 5841.46s]  I'm trying.
[5841.46s -> 5842.42s]  Do whatever it takes.
[5843.46s -> 5845.30s]  I have no more ammo.
[5845.30s -> 5846.02s]  I have no more...
[5846.02s -> 5847.46s]  Yeah, I can crawl with knife.
[5849.64s -> 5850.60s]  I'm dying, dude.
[5852.28s -> 5853.96s]  I get in this position when I play VR.
[5857.67s -> 5857.99s]  All right.
[5858.63s -> 5859.51s]  Nice job, guys.
[5861.60s -> 5863.12s]  Somebody said fucking noobs.
[5863.12s -> 5864.08s]  Keep that thing alive.
[5864.08s -> 5864.64s]  Keep that thing alive.
[5865.44s -> 5866.08s]  Keep it in crawl.
[5867.04s -> 5867.68s]  950.
[5867.84s -> 5868.40s]  I won't make the new...
[5869.68s -> 5870.64s]  Yeah, just keep heading around.
[5870.64s -> 5870.88s]  We're good.
[5870.88s -> 5871.20s]  We're good.
[5871.20s -> 5871.52s]  We're good.
[5872.48s -> 5876.16s]  Just fucking stop explaining what you're gonna explain.
[5876.16s -> 5877.28s]  Yeah, I'm just panicking.
[5877.28s -> 5878.32s]  Dude, he's getting closer.
[5878.32s -> 5878.56s]  All right.
[5878.56s -> 5879.20s]  Buy us all some.
[5879.20s -> 5880.24s]  Open another door over here.
[5880.24s -> 5881.52s]  Hey, there's rocks over here.
[5882.88s -> 5883.52s]  If you...
[5883.52s -> 5883.76s]  Oh, God.
[5883.76s -> 5886.00s]  Apparently, the blue one, there should be an item in here.
[5886.00s -> 5887.04s]  Oh, it's 500.
[5887.04s -> 5887.84s]  Fucking do that.
[5887.84s -> 5888.56s]  Never mind.
[5888.56s -> 5889.12s]  How much is it?
[5890.00s -> 5890.88s]  I can't buy another gun.
[5891.60s -> 5893.20s]  Dude, I'm gonna get killed by this thing.
[5893.20s -> 5893.52s]  I can't...
[5893.52s -> 5893.92s]  Hey, hey.
[5893.92s -> 5894.32s]  Shoot him.
[5894.32s -> 5895.04s]  Should I shoot him?
[5895.04s -> 5895.28s]  Help.
[5895.28s -> 5895.92s]  Help.
[5895.92s -> 5896.56s]  I don't know.
[5896.56s -> 5897.68s]  Wait, did I kill you?
[5898.32s -> 5899.92s]  Get him off, man.
[5899.92s -> 5901.04s]  I don't know if I killed you or not.
[5901.60s -> 5902.32s]  Just...
[5902.32s -> 5903.36s]  No, just get me up.
[5903.36s -> 5904.24s]  Don't let that thing come.
[5904.24s -> 5906.00s]  Don't let that thing get you.
[5906.00s -> 5908.00s]  Please, fuck off.
[5908.00s -> 5909.20s]  All right, I'll be over here.
[5909.20s -> 5910.32s]  I'll be like the dog food.
[5911.92s -> 5914.08s]  I'll leave him for two seconds.
[5914.80s -> 5916.08s]  I think I accidentally tinged him.
[5916.08s -> 5918.00s]  There's a player over here on the wall that says you can draw it.
[5918.00s -> 5919.28s]  And I don't know what the fuck that even...
[5919.28s -> 5922.16s]  I'm gonna kill this thing so I get enough money to open this door for us.
[5922.16s -> 5922.56s]  And then we're gonna...
[5922.56s -> 5923.52s]  I still have a pistol.
[5923.52s -> 5923.84s]  Don't do...
[5923.84s -> 5924.24s]  Yeah.
[5924.24s -> 5924.80s]  There's more.
[5924.80s -> 5926.08s]  There's more pathways over here.
[5926.08s -> 5926.80s]  Here, I opened it.
[5927.76s -> 5928.24s]  2,000.
[5928.24s -> 5929.12s]  Oh, the power isn't here.
[5929.12s -> 5929.60s]  Power isn't here.
[5929.60s -> 5930.24s]  This is 2,000.
[5930.80s -> 5931.94s]  Oh, that's 2,000.
[5932.82s -> 5936.26s]  I mean, I feel like we need to open up some of the stuff connecting these rooms together.
[5936.26s -> 5936.74s]  I have to kill this thing.
[5936.74s -> 5938.26s]  It's freaking me out.
[5938.26s -> 5938.90s]  I think that works.
[5940.10s -> 5942.90s]  Like, I don't know how the fuck this works.
[5942.90s -> 5943.94s]  How do you draw this?
[5944.58s -> 5945.38s]  Hang on, let me see.
[5945.38s -> 5946.34s]  I'm gonna get stuck here.
[5948.02s -> 5948.90s]  I'm holding F.
[5949.62s -> 5951.54s]  I'm aiming and drawing.
[5951.54s -> 5952.26s]  I need money.
[5953.70s -> 5954.50s]  Nothing's happening.
[5955.46s -> 5956.10s]  Okay.
[5956.18s -> 5956.42s]  Yeah.
[5956.42s -> 5956.66s]  Nice.
[5957.86s -> 5958.58s]  Wow, this is like...
[5958.58s -> 5959.46s]  Oh, this is a good room.
[5959.46s -> 5960.26s]  Guys, come over here.
[5961.75s -> 5962.15s]  Good room?
[5962.15s -> 5962.95s]  This is like good shit.
[5963.99s -> 5965.43s]  You could like actually do around.
[5967.59s -> 5968.39s]  It's a slot machine.
[5969.11s -> 5969.67s]  Yeah, I just...
[5969.67s -> 5970.15s]  See?
[5970.15s -> 5970.55s]  What?
[5970.55s -> 5971.83s]  Oh, shit.
[5971.83s -> 5972.79s]  What is this?
[5972.79s -> 5973.99s]  They'll fucking lock, dude.
[5973.99s -> 5974.95s]  What is that?
[5974.95s -> 5975.51s]  I don't know.
[5975.51s -> 5975.99s]  An item?
[5977.99s -> 5978.55s]  Out of order.
[5979.43s -> 5980.63s]  You broke it.
[5980.63s -> 5981.43s]  It wasn't a weapon.
[5981.43s -> 5982.63s]  What did you get?
[5982.63s -> 5983.19s]  It was a...
[5983.19s -> 5983.75s]  I don't know.
[5984.31s -> 5985.27s]  Watch out behind you, guys.
[5986.15s -> 5986.87s]  The guy's in here.
[5986.87s -> 5987.59s]  Ow.
[5987.59s -> 5990.32s]  I think it was a shield part or something that you build.
[5990.32s -> 5990.56s]  Oh.
[5991.28s -> 5993.92s]  Yeah, there are parts in Black Ops 3, zombies,
[5993.92s -> 5998.00s]  like you pick up parts of stuff that you then construct at counters to make,
[5999.04s -> 6001.44s]  you know, into gear, I guess.
[6001.44s -> 6003.76s]  Did you see this gun on the wall?
[6003.76s -> 6004.88s]  Did you figure this thing out?
[6005.52s -> 6007.36s]  We have to find Chalk to draw that.
[6007.36s -> 6008.00s]  Keep it off him.
[6008.00s -> 6008.56s]  I need a weapon.
[6011.04s -> 6012.24s]  Present hold to draw Uzi.
[6013.28s -> 6013.52s]  Yeah.
[6013.52s -> 6014.40s]  I think we need Chalk.
[6014.40s -> 6016.32s]  I bet you need Chalk and you actually draw it on the wall.
[6016.48s -> 6017.28s]  You don't trace it.
[6017.28s -> 6018.64s]  You just need Chalk on the ground.
[6018.64s -> 6019.68s]  Oh, right here's the Chalk.
[6020.40s -> 6021.12s]  Oh, nice.
[6022.88s -> 6025.44s]  It's a gun version of Chalk.
[6025.44s -> 6027.84s]  I think we want to defend in this big room.
[6027.84s -> 6028.08s]  Yeah.
[6029.84s -> 6030.80s]  Why didn't it do it?
[6030.80s -> 6031.44s]  Did you drop a coin?
[6031.44s -> 6032.24s]  I just picked up Chalk.
[6033.68s -> 6034.40s]  Is there a tinted...
[6034.40s -> 6035.68s]  People saying tinted rocks, maybe?
[6040.31s -> 6042.39s]  It was a blue rock and you still had to buy it.
[6044.39s -> 6044.63s]  Yeah.
[6045.91s -> 6046.39s]  The fuck?
[6047.35s -> 6048.39s]  Double points.
[6049.99s -> 6050.71s]  Oh, this is fun.
[6050.71s -> 6053.83s]  I picked up the Chalk, but it doesn't let me take out the gun.
[6053.83s -> 6055.51s]  I have it in my inventory.
[6057.67s -> 6058.47s]  What the fuck?
[6059.43s -> 6063.27s]  It shows that I have Chalk.
[6064.23s -> 6065.51s]  Let me draw this Uzi.
[6066.07s -> 6066.39s]  All right.
[6066.39s -> 6067.59s]  Now we knife.
[6067.59s -> 6069.67s]  Oh, that's the 5-7 Chalk.
[6069.67s -> 6071.83s]  Now we need Chalk specific for the gun.
[6071.83s -> 6073.83s]  I'm going to open this door.
[6074.47s -> 6075.51s]  Wait, what number?
[6075.51s -> 6076.39s]  The number on the bottom left is 6.
[6076.39s -> 6077.43s]  Now our power is on.
[6078.07s -> 6080.55s]  The gun, the gun called the 5-7.
[6080.55s -> 6081.83s]  Oh, what is happening?
[6081.83s -> 6083.51s]  I fucked up, I fucked up, I fucked up.
[6083.51s -> 6085.67s]  He's in that room locked in.
[6085.67s -> 6086.71s]  He went into like a boss fight.
[6086.71s -> 6087.75s]  Why are you in a boss room?
[6087.75s -> 6089.91s]  I didn't realize this was happening.
[6089.91s -> 6090.79s]  The fuck was that?
[6091.75s -> 6093.19s]  I'm doing the boss fight without it.
[6093.19s -> 6094.15s]  Where are my friends?
[6094.95s -> 6095.43s]  Out here.
[6097.11s -> 6097.67s]  Watch out.
[6099.56s -> 6099.96s]  Run.
[6099.96s -> 6100.44s]  What the fuck?
[6100.44s -> 6101.56s]  I'm in a bad spot.
[6102.92s -> 6103.64s]  Describe it.
[6104.36s -> 6105.24s]  They're all here.
[6106.28s -> 6107.16s]  All the zombies are here.
[6107.16s -> 6107.72s]  Oh shit.
[6109.73s -> 6110.85s]  You guys have any ideas?
[6110.85s -> 6111.35s]  Hey.
[6112.69s -> 6114.13s]  How do I use those axes?
[6114.77s -> 6115.89s]  I got a DSLR.
[6115.89s -> 6117.49s]  Be known, Kraken,
[6117.49s -> 6119.49s]  that I did stay at the other side of the door
[6119.49s -> 6120.53s]  in your final moments.
[6121.09s -> 6121.73s]  Oh, thank you.
[6122.85s -> 6123.33s]  Throw it.
[6123.33s -> 6123.97s]  I don't know how to-
[6123.97s -> 6124.47s]  Oh my God.
[6128.85s -> 6129.89s]  Yeah, you can save me.
[6130.77s -> 6131.65s]  I'm going to come get you.
[6132.45s -> 6133.97s]  We're going to have to push through.
[6133.97s -> 6138.84s]  The music's gotten started now.
[6138.84s -> 6141.16s]  It started like the OG-
[6141.16s -> 6143.00s]  Yeah, I'm one of them.
[6144.71s -> 6145.75s]  Don't let me die.
[6145.75s -> 6146.87s]  I think he's going to die.
[6149.19s -> 6150.47s]  Oh, look at that no-scope, Jerm.
[6150.47s -> 6150.95s]  I saw that.
[6150.95s -> 6151.35s]  I'm dead.
[6151.35s -> 6151.91s]  Knock you.
[6153.67s -> 6155.27s]  Geez, normal grenades.
[6155.27s -> 6157.99s]  How the fuck do you throw secondary grenades?
[6157.99s -> 6159.67s]  We're going to get you out of this one, Jerma,
[6159.67s -> 6160.95s]  but you got to give me a hot sec.
[6162.77s -> 6164.69s]  I mean, actually, now I'm looking at it more.
[6164.69s -> 6166.13s]  I don't think we're going to get you out of this one.
[6167.09s -> 6168.07s]  We should be okay.
[6168.07s -> 6168.63s]  We should be okay.
[6168.63s -> 6169.59s]  I mean, we'll be okay,
[6169.75s -> 6171.59s]  but I don't know if I can get to him.
[6171.59s -> 6172.63s]  How many more are there?
[6172.63s -> 6173.91s]  Oh, we don't even know.
[6173.91s -> 6175.11s]  There's a lot left.
[6175.11s -> 6176.07s]  Oh, look out behind me.
[6176.07s -> 6177.11s]  I'm behind you.
[6177.11s -> 6177.83s]  Come on in here.
[6177.83s -> 6178.31s]  4,400.
[6178.31s -> 6178.95s]  Just get in here.
[6179.91s -> 6182.31s]  Come on.
[6182.31s -> 6184.24s]  I'm going to die.
[6184.24s -> 6185.76s]  I'm running low on ammo, James.
[6185.76s -> 6186.48s]  I'm dead.
[6186.48s -> 6187.97s]  I'm okay.
[6187.97s -> 6188.53s]  I got some.
[6192.18s -> 6192.82s]  Nuke, let's go.
[6193.62s -> 6195.30s]  Oh, you got rid of the crawler.
[6195.30s -> 6196.58s]  Don't!
[6196.58s -> 6197.30s]  No!
[6197.30s -> 6198.50s]  Wait, I'm alive.
[6198.50s -> 6199.14s]  You did it.
[6199.14s -> 6200.18s]  Hey, we did it.
[6200.18s -> 6200.68s]  Yay.
[6202.26s -> 6203.22s]  I don't have any guns, though.
[6203.78s -> 6205.14s]  Yeah, we need to get them quick.
[6205.14s -> 6205.64s]  Yeah.
[6207.86s -> 6209.06s]  That gun's good, man.
[6209.06s -> 6209.86s]  That shotgun.
[6209.86s -> 6210.58s]  Oh, what's that one?
[6211.64s -> 6213.24s]  Oh, what's the teddy bear?
[6214.12s -> 6214.92s]  I'm sorry.
[6215.48s -> 6217.00s]  Teddy bear means it goes to another location.
[6217.00s -> 6219.48s]  It means you don't get to use the box.
[6219.48s -> 6221.56s]  Oh, the box moves.
[6221.56s -> 6222.20s]  Oh, no.
[6222.20s -> 6224.04s]  Oh, there's a sail, too.
[6224.04s -> 6225.96s]  No, a fire sail.
[6225.96s -> 6228.04s]  We cannot survive in this room.
[6228.60s -> 6229.32s]  We got to go.
[6229.32s -> 6230.20s]  This one looks okay.
[6231.24s -> 6232.20s]  This gun is so bad.
[6233.16s -> 6234.28s]  Blue rock.
[6235.32s -> 6238.36s]  We got to pay that thing 500 bucks
[6238.36s -> 6239.80s]  or it's not going to go anywhere.
[6239.80s -> 6242.88s]  All right, I'm going to you guys.
[6242.88s -> 6244.88s]  I can open this fancy room.
[6244.88s -> 6245.36s]  Oh, in here.
[6245.36s -> 6246.08s]  In here, gang.
[6246.08s -> 6246.48s]  In here.
[6248.00s -> 6248.80s]  Wait, it came back.
[6248.80s -> 6249.28s]  It came back.
[6249.28s -> 6249.68s]  Thank god.
[6250.48s -> 6251.20s]  The box is here, too.
[6252.24s -> 6253.04s]  Use this one.
[6253.04s -> 6253.92s]  I'll cover you.
[6253.92s -> 6254.48s]  Hold for part.
[6254.48s -> 6254.88s]  What is that?
[6254.88s -> 6257.28s]  I need to touch that thing.
[6257.28s -> 6258.00s]  What do I do with that thing?
[6258.00s -> 6258.24s]  What?
[6258.24s -> 6260.24s]  I don't get to touch the teddy.
[6260.24s -> 6262.32s]  What did you do to the box where the box goes?
[6262.32s -> 6264.08s]  Teddy, I didn't touch it.
[6264.08s -> 6265.28s]  I didn't touch anything.
[6265.28s -> 6266.08s]  He took the box.
[6266.64s -> 6267.92s]  I didn't press any buttons at all.
[6268.88s -> 6269.84s]  What's happening?
[6271.04s -> 6272.15s]  I wanted to use that thing.
[6272.15s -> 6273.75s]  Are you okay in there?
[6273.75s -> 6273.99s]  No.
[6275.11s -> 6276.92s]  I got a slot machine part.
[6277.80s -> 6279.20s]  The teddy bear is over here.
[6280.88s -> 6282.64s]  Whenever I walk up to something to use it,
[6282.64s -> 6283.68s]  someone has just been there
[6283.68s -> 6285.12s]  and when I try to use it, it's broken.
[6285.12s -> 6286.80s]  This slot machine is on fire now.
[6287.52s -> 6288.76s]  I'm out of ammo.
[6289.48s -> 6292.42s]  Can I make a crawler?
[6292.42s -> 6292.98s]  I don't think I can.
[6292.98s -> 6294.34s]  Why did you get out of that slot machine?
[6294.34s -> 6296.02s]  Because the second I tried to use it, it broke.
[6297.30s -> 6298.50s]  The fire still puts them everywhere
[6298.50s -> 6299.46s]  if someone's telling me so.
[6300.26s -> 6300.58s]  There you go.
[6301.14s -> 6301.86s]  You guys okay?
[6302.66s -> 6304.26s]  Yeah, but the teddy bear is over here.
[6304.26s -> 6304.34s]  I made a crawler.
[6304.34s -> 6304.82s]  You're good.
[6304.82s -> 6305.62s]  You can explore.
[6306.90s -> 6308.02s]  Hold F for part.
[6308.02s -> 6309.70s]  Does anyone know what the teddy bear does?
[6309.70s -> 6310.02s]  Hang on.
[6310.02s -> 6310.58s]  Let me take a look.
[6311.22s -> 6312.18s]  If there's a part on the ground,
[6312.18s -> 6312.34s]  I found it.
[6312.34s -> 6312.74s]  I found it.
[6312.74s -> 6313.54s]  I see it.
[6313.54s -> 6313.94s]  See this?
[6313.94s -> 6314.26s]  I found the box.
[6314.26s -> 6314.58s]  See that?
[6314.58s -> 6315.30s]  See that foot?
[6316.66s -> 6317.30s]  See that?
[6317.30s -> 6318.50s]  Yeah, that's the part.
[6318.50s -> 6318.74s]  Oh.
[6319.62s -> 6321.14s]  When we get a couple of those,
[6321.14s -> 6322.98s]  you can put them together on a bench
[6322.98s -> 6325.54s]  and you can make a fancy weapon.
[6325.54s -> 6326.26s]  It's not four.
[6327.46s -> 6327.78s]  Nice.
[6327.78s -> 6328.74s]  Max ammo.
[6328.74s -> 6329.14s]  Thank you.
[6329.46s -> 6329.94s]  Rocks.
[6330.98s -> 6331.38s]  Dibs.
[6332.02s -> 6332.18s]  No.
[6333.06s -> 6334.58s]  No me dibs, please.
[6334.58s -> 6335.06s]  Oh my god.
[6336.42s -> 6338.02s]  Oh, you have grenades.
[6338.02s -> 6338.34s]  Yes.
[6338.90s -> 6339.22s]  Oh.
[6339.22s -> 6339.78s]  Yeah, nice.
[6339.78s -> 6340.74s]  Classic pistol.
[6341.46s -> 6342.66s]  Step aside, will ya?
[6343.38s -> 6343.86s]  Press F.
[6343.86s -> 6346.84s]  I want to go again.
[6348.20s -> 6348.84s]  Sorry.
[6348.84s -> 6350.45s]  What do you got?
[6352.08s -> 6352.72s]  Not bad.
[6353.76s -> 6355.78s]  What's in the mystery box?
[6355.78s -> 6357.22s]  How about I get like the half-life hand?
[6358.18s -> 6359.76s]  Where the fuck are you guys?
[6359.76s -> 6361.12s]  I keep seeing that in like some weird-
[6361.12s -> 6362.56s]  I keep seeing this fucking crawler over here.
[6362.90s -> 6364.82s]  I mean, do you really have to babysit it
[6364.82s -> 6366.10s]  or can you like sort of leave it?
[6366.10s -> 6367.70s]  It'll die on its own if you leave it.
[6367.70s -> 6368.18s]  Oh, will it?
[6368.18s -> 6369.14s]  Well, I'll trade off with you.
[6369.14s -> 6369.62s]  You go ahead.
[6369.62s -> 6370.18s]  I have no money.
[6371.06s -> 6372.18s]  All right, what'd you guys do over here?
[6372.18s -> 6372.74s]  Tag.
[6372.74s -> 6373.14s]  Tag me.
[6373.94s -> 6375.14s]  Tag, you're in.
[6376.18s -> 6377.14s]  Uh, how do I get in there?
[6378.55s -> 6380.07s]  Can I open this door for $750?
[6380.79s -> 6382.15s]  Uh, skip that one because I'm on the-
[6383.35s -> 6384.61s]  Because I'm on the other side.
[6387.22s -> 6388.74s]  Yeah, that takes us back to Swan.
[6390.90s -> 6393.38s]  Do you guys need somebody with more money
[6393.38s -> 6394.82s]  to fucking open some more shit?
[6395.30s -> 6395.54s]  Yeah.
[6395.54s -> 6396.58s]  Don't let this thing die.
[6396.58s -> 6396.98s]  This one?
[6397.54s -> 6398.26s]  What should I open?
[6400.26s -> 6402.26s]  I don't know if there's like multiple furs or what,
[6403.22s -> 6405.54s]  but there's a key door over by me.
[6405.54s -> 6406.58s]  I don't know if you can open it.
[6407.54s -> 6409.06s]  Wait, what happened to the zombie?
[6409.06s -> 6409.54s]  Okay.
[6409.54s -> 6410.50s]  How much is the key door?
[6411.14s -> 6411.62s]  I don't know.
[6411.62s -> 6413.14s]  It's over here by me.
[6413.14s -> 6413.86s]  I'll walk over to it.
[6413.86s -> 6415.38s]  But I gotta make sure the zombie doesn't get too far away.
[6415.38s -> 6416.34s]  Yeah, there's a key door here.
[6416.34s -> 6417.22s]  He's stuck on a rock.
[6417.22s -> 6419.22s]  I'm so fucking excited for that.
[6420.82s -> 6421.70s]  This one's $2000.
[6422.74s -> 6423.94s]  I'm holding in P for that.
[6423.94s -> 6424.74s]  Stop looking at him.
[6425.06s -> 6427.06s]  There's another $2000 door over here as well.
[6428.02s -> 6431.59s]  I guess just don't be careful.
[6431.59s -> 6433.75s]  One of the $2000 doors that's blue
[6433.75s -> 6435.43s]  leads into the same room we've already opened.
[6436.23s -> 6437.59s]  Because it is too much of a distance.
[6437.59s -> 6439.03s]  So make sure you don't get that room.
[6440.61s -> 6443.01s]  Oh, I see an item room.
[6443.01s -> 6444.21s]  It looks like it makes a random...
[6444.93s -> 6447.25s]  But we need the chalk for all of these guns.
[6448.05s -> 6449.01s]  Seriously?
[6449.01s -> 6449.57s]  Yeah.
[6449.57s -> 6452.13s]  You need to find the chalk that goes with...
[6452.13s -> 6452.93s]  Wait, no.
[6452.93s -> 6455.89s]  Press and hold F to pick up AN-94 chalk.
[6455.89s -> 6457.41s]  Oh, this is like you get the chalk here
[6457.41s -> 6459.25s]  and then you bring it to the room.
[6459.25s -> 6460.05s]  Oh shit, okay.
[6461.25s -> 6463.81s]  So I'll tell you guys which one this was over here.
[6463.81s -> 6465.97s]  We need Uzi's chalk.
[6465.97s -> 6466.47s]  I got it.
[6467.01s -> 6467.65s]  Yeah, get the Uzi's chalk.
[6467.65s -> 6468.85s]  Put that on the wall there.
[6471.38s -> 6474.02s]  I'll just be here babysitting the zombie.
[6475.14s -> 6477.04s]  That's $1500.
[6477.04s -> 6477.84s]  Stop getting me...
[6477.84s -> 6479.36s]  You still have to pay for it after that?
[6479.36s -> 6479.84s]  What the fuck?
[6479.84s -> 6480.32s]  Yeah.
[6480.32s -> 6481.04s]  And you gotta pay.
[6481.04s -> 6482.24s]  You gotta find it and pay.
[6483.20s -> 6485.40s]  That's a good perk that we got back here.
[6486.04s -> 6486.60s]  Mule kick.
[6487.48s -> 6488.29s]  God.
[6488.93s -> 6490.93s]  I like that everyone's getting excited for this map
[6490.93s -> 6493.09s]  because the next one's gonna be trash.
[6494.21s -> 6494.85s]  Trash.
[6496.28s -> 6497.16s]  Garbage.
[6497.16s -> 6498.12s]  I want to play Mario Kart.
[6498.12s -> 6498.68s]  What's in here?
[6499.56s -> 6501.24s]  I picked a lot of Mario maps
[6501.24s -> 6504.12s]  because they're almost as plentiful as Halloween and Christmas maps.
[6505.40s -> 6507.89s]  Why am I getting vote kicked in my own chat?
[6511.11s -> 6511.61s]  What?
[6513.70s -> 6515.14s]  Have we gotten most of the doors?
[6516.34s -> 6517.06s]  What's this music?
[6517.70s -> 6518.26s]  Yeah, do you hear it?
[6518.26s -> 6519.14s]  Get closer to the button.
[6525.04s -> 6526.64s]  I don't remember this being in Binding of Isaac.
[6527.28s -> 6529.60s]  I don't think that's a part of Binding of Isaac at all.
[6532.13s -> 6533.97s]  Hey, can I kill this stupid zombie now?
[6533.97s -> 6534.47s]  Yeah.
[6535.01s -> 6536.21s]  Yeah, we don't have anything else.
[6539.36s -> 6540.32s]  Oh, it's this thing.
[6541.22s -> 6542.90s]  Mule kick is three guns instead of two.
[6542.90s -> 6543.40s]  Oh, okay.
[6544.42s -> 6545.46s]  PhD Flopper.
[6545.46s -> 6546.42s]  Do you know what that is?
[6546.42s -> 6548.26s]  That's the one we need to be the dolphin dive.
[6548.90s -> 6550.18s]  Yeah, it blows up.
[6551.30s -> 6553.30s]  Okay, I'm gonna hang out in this big square room
[6554.10s -> 6556.64s]  if y'all want to join me.
[6557.60s -> 6562.69s]  We haven't found Juggernaut, have we?
[6563.33s -> 6563.83s]  No.
[6564.45s -> 6567.64s]  What about Stamina?
[6570.39s -> 6571.51s]  This one makes a cool noise.
[6572.31s -> 6577.51s]  I feel like the Stamina one was in that first one with the blue rock
[6577.51s -> 6579.59s]  where the slots was with the Uzi.
[6580.31s -> 6581.51s]  This map would be good for that.
[6583.03s -> 6585.35s]  Guys, I got stuck.
[6591.57s -> 6593.01s]  I'm still learning.
[6593.01s -> 6595.75s]  I can get you.
[6596.55s -> 6597.11s]  I can get you.
[6597.91s -> 6601.84s]  I don't even know why I switched guns.
[6603.60s -> 6604.24s]  Now, scroll.
[6604.96s -> 6606.00s]  I thought I had the shotgun.
[6606.00s -> 6606.72s]  I do.
[6606.72s -> 6607.22s]  Ow!
[6613.24s -> 6614.44s]  S-V-U-A-S.
[6615.24s -> 6615.74s]  Chalk.
[6616.12s -> 6618.28s]  Just buy my fucking custom random-
[6618.28s -> 6618.92s]  Ray gun!
[6618.92s -> 6619.88s]  Come on, man.
[6619.88s -> 6620.38s]  Whatever.
[6621.24s -> 6625.60s]  That means that my arms have never been done.
[6625.60s -> 6626.40s]  What was that?
[6626.40s -> 6627.60s]  Why is there a nuke right there?
[6628.24s -> 6630.80s]  That's like a fucking pentagram.
[6630.80s -> 6632.32s]  Hey, I'm standing on a pentagram.
[6632.32s -> 6633.60s]  It's rotating around.
[6633.60s -> 6634.72s]  Yeah, that's gonna be good.
[6634.72s -> 6635.52s]  Was that you doing that?
[6635.52s -> 6636.08s]  Check it off.
[6636.72s -> 6637.28s]  Uh, maybe.
[6637.92s -> 6638.72s]  I'm afraid to get off.
[6638.72s -> 6639.28s]  Oh, fuck!
[6639.28s -> 6639.92s]  What is that?
[6639.92s -> 6640.48s]  I don't know.
[6640.48s -> 6641.20s]  Oh, why?
[6643.84s -> 6644.56s]  Oh, fuck.
[6644.56s -> 6645.44s]  What's with the coordinates?
[6645.44s -> 6646.72s]  What the fuck is that?
[6647.84s -> 6648.96s]  Yo, there's some-
[6648.96s -> 6652.24s]  There's some sort of ghost chasing after me right now.
[6652.24s -> 6653.76s]  What the fuck are those things?
[6653.76s -> 6654.32s]  Oh, we're on-
[6654.32s -> 6655.52s]  Okay, we're on the same page.
[6656.80s -> 6658.40s]  They spawned out of there.
[6658.40s -> 6658.80s]  All right.
[6662.80s -> 6664.31s]  What is up with all the numbers?
[6664.31s -> 6665.43s]  Is that the fucking coordinates?
[6665.75s -> 6666.95s]  There's money in like-
[6666.95s -> 6667.59s]  Break these down!
[6668.63s -> 6669.51s]  What are the numbers mean?
[6669.51s -> 6670.07s]  As they come out.
[6672.10s -> 6673.62s]  This is just a Mega Man password.
[6673.62s -> 6674.58s]  Oh my god, what the fuck is that?
[6675.70s -> 6676.18s]  What?
[6676.18s -> 6676.68s]  Cranking?
[6677.96s -> 6678.46s]  Whoa!
[6679.56s -> 6681.16s]  Oh, there's like a super one here.
[6682.48s -> 6683.04s]  Oh, no.
[6683.04s -> 6683.52s]  What is that noise?
[6683.52s -> 6684.88s]  All right, I gotcha.
[6684.88s -> 6685.36s]  Oh, no!
[6685.36s -> 6686.74s]  I have no way out!
[6686.74s -> 6688.26s]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
[6688.26s -> 6688.90s]  I'm panicking!
[6690.74s -> 6691.54s]  Okay, he's-
[6691.54s -> 6692.82s]  Oh, shit.
[6692.82s -> 6693.38s]  We did it.
[6693.38s -> 6694.98s]  I'm gonna get you out of here.
[6694.98s -> 6695.78s]  Thank you.
[6696.26s -> 6697.06s]  You're welcome.
[6697.06s -> 6697.56s]  We did it.
[6698.36s -> 6700.60s]  You know, I always got your back, James.
[6700.60s -> 6703.00s]  I forgot about my secondary weapon.
[6703.80s -> 6706.17s]  You guys know how to open these yet?
[6706.17s -> 6706.67s]  More weapons.
[6707.85s -> 6708.57s]  Try hitting it.
[6709.37s -> 6710.57s]  Double tap root beer.
[6711.61s -> 6712.11s]  Cool.
[6714.20s -> 6715.08s]  Hey, can I play?
[6715.08s -> 6716.20s]  Can I play on the slot machine?
[6717.34s -> 6717.84s]  Yeah.
[6718.78s -> 6720.39s]  We'll need one more piece of that.
[6723.03s -> 6723.53s]  I'm dead.
[6724.55s -> 6725.29s]  Oh, I won!
[6725.29s -> 6725.79s]  I won!
[6727.93s -> 6728.43s]  Where's the-
[6728.43s -> 6729.37s]  Where's the gun thing?
[6729.37s -> 6729.87s]  Where's the-
[6729.87s -> 6730.37s]  Where's the bomb?
[6730.37s -> 6730.87s]  Crawl over here.
[6732.25s -> 6733.13s]  How do I unprone?
[6734.01s -> 6735.05s]  Crayon, how do I get up?
[6735.05s -> 6736.09s]  The same way you prone.
[6736.65s -> 6737.15s]  I don't-
[6741.18s -> 6743.82s]  All right, what does double tap even mean?
[6744.80s -> 6746.72s]  It just means you shoot twice as fast.
[6749.16s -> 6750.12s]  Yeah, fast.
[6750.12s -> 6750.62s]  Hold still.
[6751.82s -> 6752.78s]  God damn it.
[6752.78s -> 6753.26s]  Hang on.
[6753.26s -> 6754.22s]  I'll get him-
[6754.22s -> 6755.58s]  No, you get him all for you.
[6755.58s -> 6756.08s]  No!
[6756.08s -> 6756.58s]  I got a big gun.
[6756.58s -> 6757.58s]  No, they spawn behind me!
[6757.58s -> 6758.08s]  No!
[6761.26s -> 6762.46s]  I don't know if we can make it to you, man.
[6762.46s -> 6762.96s]  You're like-
[6763.68s -> 6764.56s]  Uh, we can do it.
[6764.56s -> 6765.36s]  We can do it. Let's go.
[6765.36s -> 6766.32s]  I'm pretty far.
[6766.32s -> 6767.60s]  He's like a mile away.
[6768.32s -> 6769.36s]  This grenade.
[6774.16s -> 6776.80s]  Four grenades into the chasm next to him.
[6778.66s -> 6779.22s]  I'm going for him.
[6779.22s -> 6779.72s]  I'm going for him.
[6780.74s -> 6781.24s]  All right.
[6782.34s -> 6782.98s]  We're with you.
[6787.33s -> 6790.45s]  Oh, they all go down in the chasm.
[6790.45s -> 6791.33s]  I need a new gun.
[6791.33s -> 6792.37s]  I got insta-kill.
[6796.51s -> 6797.01s]  Yeah.
[6797.49s -> 6797.99s]  Fuck.
[6798.45s -> 6799.25s]  Where's the guns?
[6799.65s -> 6801.73s]  All right, let's try to keep a couple of these alive now.
[6801.73s -> 6802.93s]  I think we're reaching the end.
[6802.93s -> 6804.61s]  Uh, we can spend some time.
[6806.61s -> 6807.81s]  PhD flopper.
[6808.53s -> 6809.81s]  I don't know what that is, but I got it.
[6811.07s -> 6813.71s]  I don't know how to PhD flop in Black Ops 3.
[6813.71s -> 6815.23s]  That was something in like Black Ops 1.
[6816.51s -> 6817.39s]  Is it like control?
[6817.39s -> 6818.43s]  No, not control.
[6819.63s -> 6822.10s]  I just don't kill any of the zombies that are still alive.
[6823.17s -> 6823.65s]  Maybe is it-
[6823.65s -> 6824.53s]  I think I want a different gun.
[6825.49s -> 6827.76s]  There's always the random box.
[6827.76s -> 6829.44s]  You can slide with C.
[6829.44s -> 6830.56s]  I don't know what that is.
[6830.56s -> 6831.06s]  Oh shit.
[6831.52s -> 6832.16s]  Wow, you can.
[6833.44s -> 6836.96s]  Where's the box at?
[6836.96s -> 6837.84s]  I got a fucking teddy.
[6837.84s -> 6840.00s]  Oh, it's right here now.
[6840.64s -> 6842.88s]  Uh, it looks like it changes spots, actually.
[6845.02s -> 6845.98s]  All right, I'm going to open this.
[6847.02s -> 6848.06s]  I don't even know if this is-
[6848.06s -> 6849.58s]  this goes to anything, honestly.
[6851.70s -> 6852.66s]  That's like the last zombie.
[6852.66s -> 6853.30s]  Wait, what's this?
[6853.86s -> 6854.34s]  Oh, god damn it.
[6854.34s -> 6855.38s]  What's this death pylon?
[6855.38s -> 6857.78s]  Oh, watch out to the earth right right right right right there, zombie!
[6858.74s -> 6861.62s]  Requires gold level initialization.
[6862.18s -> 6864.02s]  Deadshot Dakiri.
[6864.02s -> 6866.62s]  I don't know if you have that
[6866.62s -> 6872.80s]  Do you have those words here initialization? I want to open. Oh dr. Nog was in here. This is just hanging out
[6872.80s -> 6875.82s]  Oh, it hurts out of the book. Oh, okay. I'm gonna kite him over here. Oh
[6877.65s -> 6879.94s]  boy, oh
[6879.94s -> 6888.83s]  Yeah, that oh I see cuz that's like the equivalent of that spike room. I get it. I want to replace the shotgun with
[6889.45s -> 6893.12s]  The m tar the fuck is all this
[6894.12s -> 6901.64s]  How do I do the flop thing before saying okay, I just got another m time what the fuck these are like
[6902.48s -> 6907.72s]  Mass-produced these things are bad. That's what I just got. I just got one. Oh, oh good. Oh
[6908.36s -> 6910.36s]  Now there goes there. Oh god
[6910.60s -> 6913.96s]  What lady a second m tar and then flew away?
[6914.76s -> 6918.94s]  Was this the door that you guys said you already unlocked on the other side this blue door here?
[6919.48s -> 6925.78s]  That's in this blue room. No, I hang on stay there. That's a team. That's a 2,000
[6926.60s -> 6932.10s]  Check I'm gonna go to where as close as I can get to that side and see if it's actually like a space or not
[6932.24s -> 6938.96s]  Well, should we kill this guy? No, I got okay. I got a tinted rock over here James
[6938.96s -> 6944.64s]  There's no way we've been there before well somebody has enough points to open it. I've spent so many points. I do things
[6945.04s -> 6947.04s]  Okay, I'll open it. I'll
[6947.56s -> 6950.16s]  I'll take the hit
[6950.16s -> 6953.68s]  If any guys know what a vulture aid is is $3,000 and it's right over here. I
[6954.28s -> 6957.20s]  Would have spent all my $2,000 plus another thousand
[6959.76s -> 6965.28s]  The fuck oh, this is uh, it's like a super gold key room for another 2k and
[6966.60s -> 6969.44s]  Then over here we know let you see everything. I
[6970.60s -> 6979.50s]  Want to go in the super gold key room? What's that? What's that? You see that see that bottle?
[6980.10s -> 6988.74s]  The bottle shoot it. I think I think it's a part, isn't it? So what's the story?
[6989.26s -> 6995.14s]  Are we doing a little 11? Oh, how many rounds through these blues? Yeah, you see this right here. Wait, wait
[6995.66s -> 7001.34s]  Boys, they spawn random. Uh, see this. Well, I was shot fenders. Oh, it's a secret. Oh
[7001.86s -> 7008.28s]  It is a wall, but it's probably a secret wall. We need a grenade step back. Oh
[7012.06s -> 7014.06s]  It rolls
[7022.13s -> 7024.13s]  I hope
[7025.33s -> 7027.33s]  We're gonna wipe and die
[7032.01s -> 7034.89s]  They drop grenades and kill themselves and then I
[7036.21s -> 7042.19s]  This thing and I was on it when they threw them including my own grenade. I can't jump over this
[7042.95s -> 7046.85s]  Why oh my god
[7050.93s -> 7055.68s]  Well, you know that was good that was a good second time
[7055.84s -> 7058.88s]  I don't know if it's random every game or not. I'm gonna assume no
[7059.56s -> 7064.35s]  It fell in the hole. My monkey bomb fell in the hole didn't work
[7065.81s -> 7069.49s]  Hey, well black ops 3 is pretty fun game. It's first time I've ever opened it
[7070.97s -> 7076.85s]  Yeah worth the 60 bucks in three years. I hope you liked the one good map. We played man cuz
[7077.37s -> 7079.99s]  Next is Candyland. It was still 60 bucks
[7080.65s -> 7087.26s]  Yep, you think it's ever gonna drop price. No, I thought maybe wait five nights at Freddy's zombies, dude
[7087.30s -> 7092.14s]  I totally grabbed that pog dude wants to do was to put five minutes of ready hog, dude
[7092.90s -> 7094.90s]  Five nights at Freddy's
[7095.02s -> 7097.02s]  Let me see if that one's already for me yet. I
[7100.60s -> 7109.36s]  Got Candyland ready for sure. Okay, let's do can't land and then five nights of Fred. Yeah, that'll be ready after that
[7109.36s -> 7112.28s]  I think after like that level I'll be caught up
[7115.29s -> 7120.65s]  I mean, hey, you gotta give you this game credit. They made itself. They made this game really moddable

[8231.86s -> 8232.62s]  saw ones
[8232.62s -> 8237.62s]  I feel like they were so inspired that I think we forgot already having done this one and just completely
[8237.86s -> 8240.82s]  Like forgot about it because I'm pretty sure we did every song
[8242.46s -> 8244.46s]  To really to

[8284.90s -> 8289.44s]  Okay, I can't guarantee the how good that one
[8289.44s -> 8294.52s]  I can I personally vetted every single one of these levels to make sure they were
[8295.16s -> 8300.28s]  The absolute peak of quality that we come to expect from black ops 3 co-op
[8301.72s -> 8306.08s]  Seems like they want the spongebob one. That's why you can find if you scroll through the list
[8306.08s -> 8309.48s]  You'll find my favorite map cheese cube re cheesed. Yeah cheese
[8309.52s -> 8311.52s]  Look good

[8317.08s -> 8322.60s]  Like subsection of black ops 3 map makers that are just obsessed with cheese cube
[8322.60s -> 8325.96s]  there's like a billion let maps called cheese cube and then like
[8326.44s -> 8332.18s]  Colon and then a title. Well, I'm obsessed with cheese cubes. Have you ever had them before they're pretty good. I mean like
[8332.96s -> 8339.98s]  Like Swiss cheese cubes. They're unbelievable. I mean, I'm just trying to think of why why that's a black ops 3
[8340.02s -> 8342.02s]  Like, you know why I have so much presence there
[8342.38s -> 8346.94s]  Maybe there's some kind of in thing with their their community. I

[9178.83s -> 9183.67s]  You see that seat right across this barricade here that little box those things eat souls
[9184.15s -> 9187.87s]  There's one by the Christmas crap that I was trying to fill up. I bet if we fill it up with

[9235.00s -> 9241.60s]  Help you know fucking rocket. I mean rockets are shit. I'm not super thrilled about this thing
[9242.24s -> 9245.92s]  Got a lot of ammo for apparently there's a juggernaut by the chum bucket
[9247.53s -> 9249.53s]  Might be worth an investigation. Okay
[9250.13s -> 9253.14s]  That's the bacon mark chum bucket
[9253.74s -> 9261.70s]  Where's the chum? Oh, it's right next to the it's right there. I see it down this room. What the fuck?
[9263.98s -> 9268.61s]  Wait, why we need a crawler? Oh, I didn't realize that was
[9269.37s -> 9270.77s]  No
[9270.77s -> 9276.01s]  Shit, where is it over here? It's up here. We should do this anyways, cuz there's a box here
[9276.01s -> 9279.69s]  We need to get souls into I have no way. This is the chum bucket
[9280.41s -> 9282.09s]  chum bucket
[9282.13s -> 9287.41s]  Juggernaut was near chum bucket somebody said over here. I have no ammo come this way cranking. I'm covering you
[9290.36s -> 9296.68s]  Right on me. We know Tommy. Oh, there's anyone has enough money. I do I do
[9297.32s -> 9300.18s]  We want to kill stuff by this box. I think that's how we get the keys
[9302.37s -> 9305.25s]  handcuffs over there
[9305.85s -> 9307.85s]  boots
[9308.17s -> 9310.17s]  There we go
[9314.54s -> 9322.06s]  I am a god. Oh, I got missile launchers for this. So what about my accuracy rating? Who cares, dude? Just who cares?
[9325.30s -> 9330.80s]  You got I think you shot
[9344.39s -> 9349.99s]  You head right in my face then a missile hit another dog, baby. There it is
[9350.51s -> 9352.51s]  Let's just do again extra power
[9353.03s -> 9358.39s]  Extra hits before you go down. All right, just don't kill the car. There's one right there, dude. I'm gonna cut this one
[9360.11s -> 9366.32s]  That's a normal one. It's fine. He's never gonna catch me. You guys do you got to how you guys doing on ammo good?
[9366.32s -> 9370.78s]  I'm bankrupt. So I need something to do with my time. It's it by new gun cause that ammo
[9371.34s -> 9375.82s]  Hey, all right, it looks like I'm the only one with fucking 98 hundred bucks
[9377.26s -> 9381.60s]  Yeah, I've been waiting to fucking buy stuff, but you guys keep killing the last one
[9382.30s -> 9385.82s]  Go go buy it. I'm going where should I what should I buy?
[9385.82s -> 9390.70s]  I mean if you kill this thing, you can actually have enough to both open the pack a punch door and pack a punch
[9390.70s -> 9395.34s]  Probably or be close. I could open the gate. It's over here. It's by the gate
[9395.34s -> 9397.74s]  I just cast do it do it do it all this cash
[9398.70s -> 9405.95s]  Would that would that push you up enough is that would that get you 180 if you like our every hit on this guy
[9406.51s -> 9409.51s]  Punch, I don't have enough. It's I'm on
[9409.87s -> 9413.79s]  If you shoot this guy like a couple of times in the body then finish him off with a knife
[9413.79s -> 9416.91s]  What is this percacola? You can get a percacola over here
[9417.59s -> 9419.59s]  That a random perk
[9420.03s -> 9422.03s]  dig dig
[9424.23s -> 9427.07s]  It's loud it's loud it's loud it's loud it's loud tell me to dig
[9429.67s -> 9431.19s]  Hey
[9431.19s -> 9436.80s]  He's getting in here. It gives you a random perk on the road. You can dig on the road
[9438.32s -> 9444.58s]  You know James. I genuinely think if you shoot this thing like a couple times and knife him you'll get enough for dig
[9445.42s -> 9449.93s]  But do I but is there any more progress that we can do with money?

[9659.20s -> 9664.83s]  Yeah, I've seen the pop-up before too I got the bridge
[9665.59s -> 9675.85s]  They're spawning you all behind us. They're trying to spawn behind
[9676.65s -> 9680.77s]  Markers. Oh, oh it gave us a nuke. All right, these things are garbage. We don't need them
[9681.53s -> 9685.11s]  We're gonna have to hunt these keys
[9686.91s -> 9693.71s]  Creativity and ingenuity. Okay, so there's another way to our right. Yeah, right here. Okay. Oh, there is
[9694.31s -> 9696.35s]  Packing pack a punch. Oh shit
[9696.91s -> 9698.91s]  Pack a punch M16
[9699.07s -> 9701.70s]  Wait, don't kill
[9701.82s -> 9703.82s]  Why?

[9709.74s -> 9715.94s]  Pack a punch you need five thousand. You put it back in here. Oh, I only have four thousand
[9718.67s -> 9724.33s]  Put in whatever gun you want and it'll like make it a super a super gun. It'll be objectively
[9725.07s -> 9727.07s]  Nice. All right. Yeah, I'm gonna try
[9728.07s -> 9731.19s]  But then definitely don't die cuz you'll lose that. I will
[9734.75s -> 9741.60s]  Be like fail fish is like every five seconds. Yeah, I'm gonna do it and 16 right let's do it
[9746.23s -> 9753.01s]  Dude, no, this is giving me some hit markers completed
[9753.97s -> 9760.73s]  Completed what I finished the the route taxi. I'm gonna go back to super again. I got a legendary
[9761.57s -> 9766.41s]  How do you know that dude? You want to play even press F on this?
[9767.45s -> 9775.64s]  trade your pack of
[9777.56s -> 9785.54s]  Keys what I want to see if this is possible. All right guys, I'm pretty sure can you put it on there?
[9785.54s -> 9787.72s]  Yeah, I can cheese. Yeah, that's bad
[9788.12s -> 9790.80s]  So it's a crawler don't kill the crawler this time's a
[9792.76s -> 9798.60s]  How do I do it I don't know if we can make it to
[9801.76s -> 9807.72s]  Someone's gotta keep them off me. I go for you. Keep them off. There's no spawning here as well behind you
[9807.72s -> 9812.80s]  I'm not gonna be able to do it. I mean, there's no one here. I mean there were people
[9812.80s -> 9816.48s]  That's why I was to 50% health right away. I got me baby
[9817.20s -> 9820.28s]  Alright, so I got the second key crawler right here
[9820.56s -> 9822.56s]  I'm okay sure
[9830.16s -> 9833.12s]  I wasn't just gonna do that if I didn't know good
[9834.04s -> 9836.54s]  The binding of Isaac level I'm not gonna jump off
[9839.56s -> 9845.76s]  Here I think we've got a feed the souls to little shiny boxes cuz we've gotten two keys two different ways
[9845.76s -> 9847.76s]  I think it's the third way
[9848.64s -> 9853.80s]  Pathway that you opened is that it that's it the race. Yeah, all I got all we got from the shiny box
[9853.80s -> 9855.60s]  It was here was a nuke
[9855.60s -> 9858.90s]  Yeah, but we didn't get anything from the other holes that we dug. So
[9859.44s -> 9863.40s]  You don't want to do one more pass through and look around. I'm
[9864.72s -> 9867.96s]  Unity here sure nothing else is viable
[9868.76s -> 9870.76s]  nothing is double-tabble
[9870.80s -> 9872.80s]  double-tap over there by you cracking
[9873.64s -> 9880.20s]  I think was bomb stoppers. Oh bomb floppers bomb floppers. That's what I did when I killed us all into Isaac one
[9880.20s -> 9886.55s]  I think double-tap was by the beginning was it all the way back there
[9887.45s -> 9890.69s]  I'm over here. Now. I'll look for you. It's quick reload around here
[9894.16s -> 9898.04s]  Over by me is double-tap German get that
[9898.72s -> 9905.09s]  Way, oh, that's a long pretty pretty pretty close to oh, I fucking bought the wrong one
[9906.09s -> 9910.33s]  That's a kick in the pants guys. No, I'm not gonna get you'll kick. I'll get something else. I
[9911.01s -> 9914.98s]  Just get the random one
[9914.98s -> 9917.46s]  Random one is pretty good. If you have enough money to just like
[9918.46s -> 9923.14s]  100 of them might as well bang bang. There it is double-tap. Oh my god, that's loud
[9923.98s -> 9925.98s]  What?
[9926.46s -> 9936.60s]  Is there any paths we somehow miss was that quick reload that I just actually get creek fucking reload what the fuck
[9937.12s -> 9939.12s]  All right, we're gonna put our
[9940.28s -> 9946.00s]  That's amazing. I don't know. I was trying to see if there was any like paths be missed because we're still
[9946.88s -> 9948.88s]  That's okay
[9951.91s -> 9956.95s]  Little box that I know I know there's one box that's over here that I had to buy a thing to get to some pretty
[9956.95s -> 9961.83s]  That's it one box by the Krusty Krab. I'm gonna get one box that shows that maybe it's one over here
[9962.31s -> 9966.43s]  Well, look, I had to literally it's the corner of the map and I had to buy a way to get into it
[9966.43s -> 9968.43s]  There's nothing else here. So I figure if anything
[9968.87s -> 9970.87s]  Inside the car, what was that?
[9971.75s -> 9976.03s]  James what no. Oh, I thought that was a zombie. No buying perks
[9977.20s -> 9979.20s]  Okay. Hmm
[9979.32s -> 9981.80s]  Electricity electric cherry was good, but I only used it once
[9982.76s -> 9988.56s]  Yeah, electric sure is really good when every other perk is stacked with it because you're like reloading faster and moving faster
[9988.56s -> 9990.56s]  So you're headed more shit
[9992.90s -> 9996.82s]  If we make it through a couple more rounds without going down, we pretty much what is that go?
[9997.54s -> 10000.30s]  It's the widow one. I don't even know what the fuck the widow one does
[10001.34s -> 10003.74s]  That one gives you a special kind of grenade. Oh
[10006.26s -> 10010.72s]  Watch out the guys are still if you just stepped on the crawler
[10013.00s -> 10018.06s]  Their cluster grenades, ooh, maybe the race is to get the key
[10018.82s -> 10025.86s]  He got one from the race. Oh, they already got one. Okay. Yeah, why is he not aggro bastards confused?
[10025.86s -> 10027.86s]  He doesn't know who to go after anyone
[10028.42s -> 10031.54s]  Fuck I can get one stock here the boat
[10032.18s -> 10035.51s]  I'm a kill. I'm a kill him

[10043.30s -> 10047.84s]  Wait, did you get tombstone? It's rip
[10047.84s -> 10053.56s]  Yeah, when you die, you're gonna drop a tombstone, which will mean that when you've respawn you can recollect your perks
[10054.24s -> 10056.24s]  Nice
[10057.16s -> 10063.72s]  Over here guys turn left if there's one thing I know it's call of duty black ops 3 perks and
[10064.32s -> 10067.84s]  Their various this is where the shiny box is. Oh

[10090.46s -> 10093.14s]  You see those little orbs that go into it those are their souls
[10101.52s -> 10107.97s]  My god get your face out of my face
[10108.77s -> 10113.84s]  You would think that it has enough by now. Yeah, it's got like a hundred people

[10396.89s -> 10401.15s]  Where did spongebob and Patrick hide the final key? Yeah, where did they hide the final key?
[10402.01s -> 10408.33s]  The key of the STG 44. What do you think I try checking garbage cans?
[10408.69s -> 10412.87s]  That's what I thought they look at the garbage cans in this map seem a little bit too high-detail
[10415.97s -> 10418.15s]  Just get the box
[10419.63s -> 10421.85s]  Davy Jones locker the lid

[10460.97s -> 10464.65s]  Did they mean like sewer vent like a lid for honestly?
[10464.65s -> 10467.93s]  It could be opening the final door because we've opened all the mix it for the one over here. So
[10468.41s -> 10473.21s]  All right, dude, what just happened? Well, I was looking I was trying to go towards like the beam of light and oh

[10514.93s -> 10516.09s]  thing
[10516.09s -> 10518.45s]  Looks like a dual wield, which means it shoots pretty fast
[10519.05s -> 10523.45s]  Probably good pack a punched. Yeah, let's pack punch this thing. I don't know. Did you guys figure out how to dive yet?
[10523.45s -> 10527.99s]  Oh easy easy. You can't afford the pack a punch. I think they needed to open up a debris hole
[10528.53s -> 10530.53s]  Yeah back this spawn
[10534.89s -> 10536.89s]  I'm just gonna run this way for a sec. I
[10537.93s -> 10542.25s]  Don't have enough money. I will in a minute though. It's like just like holding this
[10542.57s -> 10543.85s]  No, oh
[10543.85s -> 10546.65s]  All right. They're apparently we missed one. Oh, there's the last dig site
[10547.13s -> 10553.17s]  Maybe double pack the fist gun you can double pack. I thought they just gave you more ammo fuck
[10554.57s -> 10556.57s]  Nothing. No
[10557.61s -> 10561.05s]  James does double packing do anything in this or does it just refill your ammo?
[10561.33s -> 10566.72s]  Uh, I don't know if they added that in like a later thing
[10566.72s -> 10570.08s]  I know all these zombie games merged for me after we need it
[10570.84s -> 10572.84s]  This this door right here
[10574.24s -> 10576.00s]  You see where I am
[10576.00s -> 10579.20s]  Yeah, this is the last one. We haven't open
[10579.48s -> 10582.28s]  That just goes back to the beginning. Yeah, but maybe it's okay
[10582.28s -> 10585.96s]  I was hoping it's gonna like give us a little shortcut opened all the doors thing
[10587.04s -> 10589.04s]  double packing gives special ammo
[10589.44s -> 10595.57s]  Dude, what the fuck? Where's spongebob hiding his special treasure?
[10596.13s -> 10598.13s]  No, no, we kind of
[10599.17s -> 10601.17s]  There's another power switch here. Oh
[10602.81s -> 10604.97s]  Racing stripes we exhausted all options
[10605.57s -> 10611.16s]  Power switch people are saying I pulled another switch right there. We did the power though. It's by the gate
[10611.28s -> 10615.10s]  No, there's more than one power. This one activates only one of the vending machines though
[10615.10s -> 10622.44s]  Check that maybe we're missing power on the side of every vending machine is its own power. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's true
[10623.44s -> 10625.44s]  One over here as well that's already broken
[10626.12s -> 10628.84s]  We're mr. Krabs. Don't you can't talk to mr. Krabs?
[10629.52s -> 10632.00s]  No, mr. Krabs. Don't talk. He's dead
[10632.72s -> 10635.56s]  That's just oh wait shoot all the Aquaman's
[10636.48s -> 10639.28s]  I've made man to man man to man
[10640.08s -> 10642.08s]  man to man
[10642.72s -> 10646.98s]  Alright, I see it. No, that's just a blue
[10648.18s -> 10650.18s]  Yeah
[10653.90s -> 10656.78s]  Okay
[10660.23s -> 10667.35s]  I don't have them. Oh, I had them. Oh shit. Get it. We we did it. What is this press F
[10668.15s -> 10670.15s]  50,000
[10670.63s -> 10675.79s]  Welcome to my game. I fucking hate you're gonna have to pay another 50,000 to get
[10678.47s -> 10680.47s]  What the fuck
[10681.55s -> 10683.55s]  50 grand here time
[10684.11s -> 10690.71s]  I'll have like a punch stuff. This should be okay. Yeah, just try it once and see how fast it goes up because they're right like if
[10691.63s -> 10693.63s]  Standing here. They don't spawn in here. We just
[10694.35s -> 10696.71s]  Shoot like crazy. I'll watch I'll watch behind it
[10698.55s -> 10701.84s]  See how see if it goes make sure you guys prone
[10703.00s -> 10704.64s]  extra accuracy
[10704.64s -> 10709.47s]  Yeah, no, this should be super easy if none spawn back here. This should be like like a two-round
[10710.31s -> 10717.23s]  Not two rounds not to run I was I was thinking more of like if someone
[10718.51s -> 10727.09s]  Yeah, nothing's spawning in here. We're good. So this is one person. I'm gonna shoot every enemy
[10731.17s -> 10735.93s]  Just shoot every enemy well, we just cover it. All right covering
[10736.65s -> 10743.94s]  What was that? That's a super loud coal emission
[10745.08s -> 10749.87s]  Which lets me see Oh vulture lets you see every pickup on the map
[10750.51s -> 10761.70s]  So this is just practice for you practice for you almost there. I mean honestly ten percent
[10764.96s -> 10771.69s]  Hey, I mean this is this is how you actually wouldn't go up black ops and this is an actual
[10772.81s -> 10775.44s]  Yeah

[10782.39s -> 10784.39s]  So enjoy this
[10786.07s -> 10789.95s]  I'll throw a grenade though. It's like bring it out. Actually. Now's a good chance
[10790.59s -> 10795.63s]  Chats one for McDonald's two for KFC three for Taco Bell make your decision
[10796.43s -> 10798.99s]  Which three separate food maps to do
[10800.39s -> 10809.80s]  Somebody can pack a punch again. Okay. I'm seeing a lot of threes in there. I see this blood and glory
[10810.72s -> 10813.22s]  That's cool
[10813.22s -> 10820.23s]  Now we get a max ammo out of this sir, I'm gonna run out of these
[10824.71s -> 10827.79s]  Sorry, man, I'm getting the last couple of my purge come unstoppable
[10828.59s -> 10836.15s]  18 only it looks like four more of those. Wait am I saving up now? Yeah, you're saying you got $50,000
[10838.59s -> 10841.07s]  Fuck

[10844.07s -> 10859.43s]  Well seems just like enough time to run an ad on my channel thanks guys for watching all this I did
[10865.27s -> 10867.75s]  He rent like you read like a hundred ads on
[10868.15s -> 10873.07s]  I mean so much money no idea work. Did it make you know actually was not
[10876.35s -> 10881.79s]  No, I'm not up to warrant all the the unfollows I got so at your own expense
[10883.07s -> 10884.79s]  run the ads
[10884.79s -> 10888.74s]  It was easily like a quarter of the stream
[10891.82s -> 10899.25s]  Career suicide exactly wait. I made it feel that if someone were to gift me a sub I would run an ad so
[10902.35s -> 10905.71s]  This is not gonna be worth it you're gonna open that it's gonna just say oh no
[10905.71s -> 10909.99s]  It's gonna instantly send us to the gate. It's essentially you pay to game over the key
[10911.99s -> 10915.39s]  Yeah, yeah, it's gonna be credit for the easy to channel. I can't wait
[10916.67s -> 10918.55s]  15,000
[10918.55s -> 10921.99s]  This was an interesting map of straight lines
[10923.07s -> 10928.21s]  Roads, I'm gonna run out of ammo. I might have to like pack a punch again
[10929.89s -> 10931.69s]  No
[10931.69s -> 10938.24s]  You always have to buy that's gonna set us back. Oh, I know I know but like I have nothing
[10940.00s -> 10946.72s]  So they're like starting to get to us to well, I'm not firing at them. I'm running out of ammo to actually
[10947.72s -> 10967.13s]  You're gonna get to like 42,000. We're gonna all have no ammo. I'm gonna piss a bear bear
[10971.20s -> 10976.46s]  How's there not been a max ammo yet Jesus
[10977.42s -> 10986.58s]  We're too far away from them. No, there's there's perks popping up. There's drops. It's just not a good
[10986.70s -> 10991.90s]  I'm any good ones. All right, I am out of ammo. So fun. I'm running out too
[10991.90s -> 10996.46s]  I should pack a punch real quick. No, I don't know don't don't I have 20

[11008.18s -> 11012.96s]  Okay, it actually didn't give me any ammo. It filled up
[11014.28s -> 11023.32s]  It gave me an extra perk. I don't know what the fuck that even does for me. But oh
[11024.71s -> 11027.70s]  God, when is he coming back?
[11029.52s -> 11031.52s]  I don't know, but I need to pack a punch now
[11032.52s -> 11038.38s]  Wait, did we get one? Oh, that's a death machine
[11047.12s -> 11052.78s]  Weak it's it's weak compared to I pack a punch this thing. It didn't even give me any ammo. We're gonna die here
[11055.44s -> 11057.44s]  I have no way of helping
[11065.74s -> 11067.74s]  How long is this fucking P
[11069.26s -> 11071.26s]  I get he's gonna die

[11073.54s -> 11075.22s]  He's dead
[11075.22s -> 11077.22s]  There's nothing we can do
[11077.26s -> 11081.06s]  Get him up. Maybe you won't notice if you get him up. There's no dude. There's no hammer
[11081.34s -> 11086.60s]  Wait, it's a kill. It's a kill. It's a kill. Okay. All right, James kill them all knife him if you have to

[11096.73s -> 11098.73s]  There's no fucking
[11099.37s -> 11101.37s]  I know I know I have an idea
[11101.41s -> 11104.36s]  If we take a wall
[11104.40s -> 11109.33s]  Item now we can probably switch it to pack a punch. I'm down
[11109.97s -> 11115.39s]  You're down. What do you mean? You're down? Oh, what was that sound over here pack a punch?

[11171.38s -> 11173.79s]  Yeah, it was amazing, dude
[11174.35s -> 11176.35s]  Spongebob rolls up in his bikini bottom
[11176.55s -> 11180.41s]  It's car and he says Patrick we're gonna go jelly hunting. Do you want to come too?
[11180.41s -> 11182.41s]  and then we all got in the car and
[11182.71s -> 11185.55s]  The game crashes but game worth it. Yeah
[11186.15s -> 11189.80s]  Did you not see it were you were you away I was

[11193.96s -> 11198.56s]  I was a long fuck is a pretty long P we assumed after a while. He just like needed to talk to you stream
[11201.77s -> 11206.29s]  You didn't hear me say I'm gonna go pee cuz we know we heard you say you were gonna go pee and then
[11206.29s -> 11208.29s]  It was like 20 minutes
[11211.61s -> 11213.85s]  He shouldn't come a little okay chat

[11226.81s -> 11230.68s]  We won. We did it. It's good level
[11231.28s -> 11235.30s]  Well, we didn't play Taco Bell Taco Bell was a heavy. Oh, we did it
[11235.86s -> 11239.62s]  We did lots of people were asking for Taco Bell next I think
[11240.26s -> 11243.67s]  Okay, I still want to do Mario Kart. Oh
[11244.75s -> 11250.00s]  Wow, my microphone went up to 160 for suddenly and I got a little
[11251.14s -> 11253.14s]  jumpy
[11253.34s -> 11256.62s]  Freddy's as well, too. I'm fine with anything. I mean, I was just thinking, you know
[11256.62s -> 11261.95s]  I've done for Mario Kart five nights Freddy's or Taco Bell is the lobby up yet or no
[11262.19s -> 11266.59s]  No, hang on. Did that count as a good map or a joke awful map?
[11266.59s -> 11269.31s]  I would say it's more in the middle. I'd say it wasn't quite good
[11269.87s -> 11276.79s]  A little serious about would you guys consider that one a shit because if we do Taco Bell that is a guaranteed to be the worst
[11276.79s -> 11281.59s]  You ever played alright. Oh, wait, wait, wait, they lost because I went to go pee and they ran out of ammo
[11281.59s -> 11287.37s]  I thought he was gonna sit here and have a farm for like a few minutes
[11290.82s -> 11299.04s]  Meet a mutant deaf and what was that sound you were just doing in my ear? Oh now you now you're quiet
[11299.44s -> 11304.44s]  Wait, what happened? I don't know. He started making these like gum smacking sounds and like pissed me off
[11305.00s -> 11311.96s]  Quiet when I called him gum spacking. Yeah, I was like you wouldn't you'd have to I'll probably do it again
[11313.24s -> 11320.41s]  Yeah, it sound like it sound like that. Who thing you did earlier cranking on out work like that gross
[11320.41s -> 11325.49s]  I don't know you guys are talking about you know what I'm talking. I was I went to pee
[11329.78s -> 11334.12s]  Wait, where am I? What is this? You're in multiplayer
[11334.72s -> 11338.48s]  Fuck I get out. You're in the game. Wait, what?
[11339.68s -> 11345.54s]  Game cranking I don't want to be here. Where's the exit?
[11346.58s -> 11356.60s]  They really don't I mean, I guess I could host snow if you're trapped in the game
[11357.68s -> 11363.61s]  Are you guys actually have to buy one of these people or else you can't leave? All right
[11363.89s -> 11370.27s]  Why are you hosting or should I you can just host again? It's been fine so far
[11370.27s -> 11374.19s]  Plus, I'm not sure if I've ever lost team. Is it up now? It is up now
[11375.11s -> 11377.99s]  All right, you want five minutes of Freddy's?
[11378.51s -> 11380.11s]  Might be shit
[11380.11s -> 11382.11s]  This is also a thing we have to do
[11382.39s -> 11388.82s]  Yeah, okay. Let's well bang them out quick. We got uh, oh, yeah, I don't see it the hell let's do
[11389.34s -> 11393.00s]  Taco Bell five minutes Freddy's. There's there's Super Mario 64 zombies
[11393.66s -> 11397.78s]  Which looks better than the other time we did that and then there's oh there it goes
[11398.94s -> 11400.74s]  I want to do
[11400.74s -> 11406.94s]  Dude, there's a lot of extra minecraft levels. I think we wrote off minecraft too soon
[11406.94s -> 11408.94s]  I got like eight of those
[11410.58s -> 11414.26s]  The beginning because people weren't ready, but there's a lot of minecraft in there
[11414.90s -> 11418.65s]  There's also Simpsons. There's saw still
[11419.37s -> 11425.15s]  Saw is so good. They've must have fucking made a Simpsons level. There is I mean, I got it in the pack
[11425.17s -> 11432.45s]  Do you think I missed something? I got no I got everything but I would do almost every page of the fucking
[11432.45s -> 11435.85s]  I believe it. I downloaded all of them. It took me two hours
[11436.85s -> 11441.17s]  Hey, I mean you can't fault me. I put effort into picking these up
[11441.49s -> 11443.49s]  to some extent, okay
[11444.82s -> 11451.50s]  Okay, saw three the final chapter. I guarantee you will be good times. I can't guarantee that
[11451.50s -> 11456.34s]  I don't think it's even made by the same guy who made the good level. Oh, no really shit when I snuck in
[11457.38s -> 11461.30s]  Trap you. Yeah, this might have been my son. No, there's there's saw one
[11461.30s -> 11466.11s]  There's saw two there's saw three the final chapter and then there's jigsaw. We're playing soft
[11467.23s -> 11472.35s]  There's a lot of chapters. They really love me. There's like 18 saw movies to be fair
[11473.03s -> 11478.47s]  One though, right? Yeah, you're right. You're right. Maybe you're right. It might be the you know
[11478.47s -> 11481.55s]  They're fresh that one that jigsaw was made in like 2017. So
[11482.47s -> 11484.84s]  Probably operating
[11485.16s -> 11492.83s]  There is definitely a couple of traps like my own saw sort of traps that I put in this mod pack
[11492.95s -> 11496.67s]  Cuz I wasn't I mean, I guess I guess they are officially traps now cuz you're the host
[11497.67s -> 11499.27s]  So what's up?
[11499.27s -> 11504.23s]  Can I just join off you or the lobbies private or come back? Yeah, you should be in there. I said you're in it
[11504.23s -> 11506.23s]  Yeah, yeah for the future
[11506.47s -> 11511.07s]  Lack of titties, man. You want tits that bad? I can get one. You want me?
[11511.07s -> 11516.03s]  Hang on. I'll get one. I can get one fuck. Yeah. All right, Jesus. Give me like ten sex
[11517.79s -> 11523.27s]  There was also a mod that makes everyone Kermit is that your thing too you want me to get you want me to
[11523.53s -> 11527.21s]  Pander to James now. Well, I feel like I've experienced that already
[11527.93s -> 11532.49s]  Okay, then uh, what the fuck is little do they know this is like, yeah the final chapter
[11532.49s -> 11538.45s]  There's like eight more. What am I looking at one of these guys? This guy's maps before killjoy. We play. Oh, you're right
[11538.85s -> 11542.17s]  That was candy land. Oh, this is the trap. I fooled you all
[11543.89s -> 11547.81s]  Yes, welcome to my dungeon this was a mistake
[11549.21s -> 11552.61s]  What is our what was our knife do we
[11553.61s -> 11556.13s]  Spam click I don't think we get oh we got a lot of money
[11557.21s -> 11562.94s]  We all like this like an actual level guys. So um last chance

[11712.26s -> 11714.56s]  Four seconds

[11848.19s -> 11850.19s]  Hey
[11861.15s -> 11867.59s]  Wait, we have to find out what the game is. This is writing the wall game. All right, the blood shirt like surely doesn't hurt you
[11871.15s -> 11873.15s]  Don't touch the blood don't touch the blood
[11876.45s -> 11878.77s]  Do you know how to hack no
[11879.05s -> 11884.62s]  I don't have anything come over here check it. I won't even know how to hack
[11886.78s -> 11889.90s]  I'm not fucking around. No, he does. I need a
[11892.06s -> 11897.78s]  We need to learn real quick guys, okay, maybe in that box is the secret tech. What was that?
[11899.78s -> 11906.30s]  Alright as soon as you start talking nobody move and let him finish his head because he gets spooked if we're moving too much
[11906.30s -> 11908.30s]  He's drunk. Oh
[11908.42s -> 11915.64s]  Oh wait, I heard him again. Oh shoot this. Yeah, that's what I was just shooting it not doing anything

[11940.76s -> 11945.05s]  Okay
[11945.33s -> 11951.28s]  However, this next challenge will test your ability to adapt to your surroundings
[11951.88s -> 11953.88s]  Literally talking to just them
[11955.72s -> 11960.80s]  Okay, wait, so you two got to talk to Jigsaw I didn't wait I shot I shot a bear in the fire
[11960.80s -> 11965.52s]  And it did something it disappeared. Did you learn how to hack? It said get used to your surroundings
[11965.76s -> 11970.08s]  We need Jigsaw's key for this room. I'm okay with your dying if I get to live
[11970.72s -> 11972.96s]  There that he decided he was too lazy to write to
[11973.80s -> 11976.14s]  Did Jigsaw have a knee brace in the movies?
[11977.32s -> 11981.00s]  Yes, you see the last one we got crippled. No, I don't said
[11981.64s -> 11983.74s]  Okay on if you stand next to this
[11984.80s -> 11989.08s]  Guys, you couldn't hear Jigsaw stand next to the walkie-talkie. Yes. That's when you can hear him
[11989.88s -> 11992.57s]  What does he say?
[11992.57s -> 11994.57s]  Run past him
[11996.77s -> 11999.71s]  His button on the ceiling
[11999.99s -> 12005.66s]  He says ass if you keep running past it button on the sale asshole button on the ceiling asshole
[12006.58s -> 12009.74s]  Asshole mine's actually not bugging out. I can hear the whole thing
[12010.14s -> 12018.36s]  All right test our ability to adapt to our surroundings. I think two two of us have to go in here and die
[12019.00s -> 12025.45s]  That doesn't seem I don't think Jigsaw. I mean, I guess he does like was this no die. So what?
[12025.81s -> 12031.93s]  Oh, no, no to if I get if I live get to know I'm okay with your sign if I get to live
[12031.93s -> 12033.93s]  It has got nothing to do with
[12037.93s -> 12039.93s]  His dialogue
[12040.13s -> 12044.05s]  Stop I can't get out of the blood. I can't get out of the blood
[12045.33s -> 12049.29s]  Okay, we guys we got to adapt to our surroundings. Okay
[12049.65s -> 12054.61s]  I'd know not to jump into the pool of blood which means I've adapted to my surroundings
[12054.61s -> 12056.61s]  Red is dead
[12058.13s -> 12060.75s]  So, what do I do now?
[12061.59s -> 12063.59s]  There's that door
[12063.67s -> 12069.94s]  Has anyone learned how to hack have we adapted to hacking no hacking over here key
[12070.98s -> 12074.50s]  Throw nade into box. Oh
[12075.46s -> 12087.56s]  Smart chat. Let's try. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay. What about in here? What about in the fireplace?
[12088.36s -> 12090.36s]  Okay, we're gonna need a fireplace

[12116.99s -> 12118.19s]  Okay
[12118.19s -> 12120.61s]  I'm not sure you can
[12120.61s -> 12125.62s]  No, maybe not. I mean, maybe there's something you need to interact with it
[12126.26s -> 12129.06s]  You can't do it I'm jumping on these
[12132.10s -> 12136.22s]  You can definitely parkour these yeah, I mean yeah you could
[12136.22s -> 12140.14s]  Oh, and then you eat your box and you get in the box totally jump to this and into the box. Okay. Yeah
[12141.02s -> 12146.28s]  All right. You ready guys. There you go
[12147.00s -> 12149.50s]  You're in

[12175.70s -> 12177.70s]  Oh
[12184.50s -> 12186.50s]  Every time I revive I'm gonna die from these
[12191.18s -> 12194.06s]  We gotta be pretty sure yeah come through I'll catch you
[12200.43s -> 12203.42s]  Okay, okay
[12204.10s -> 12208.26s]  Okay, we just everyone just let me through I'll just get picked up on the other side

[12215.98s -> 12217.95s]  Craigin
[12217.95s -> 12220.67s]  Craigin was that supposed to hit me. Oh
[12221.79s -> 12227.23s]  Shit, it wasn't even in the right place. All right, so that way hold on anything on the right side here
[12227.43s -> 12233.15s]  There's some stuff over here teddy bear. Yes. Oh wait. We just had you just had it. Oh wait
[12233.15s -> 12234.95s]  That's a different one. Oh

[12242.42s -> 12246.44s]  Help oh, I see
[12247.26s -> 12252.86s]  Another parkour. Okay, it's some sort of jump thing. Yeah, you fall and you gotta climb back up. Well, oh
[12260.29s -> 12262.29s]  It's just sliding
[12263.45s -> 12269.86s]  Why wait they don't move with you? Why you gotta move with it? That's awkward
[12270.54s -> 12273.74s]  Oh, this is this is I remember this part and saw five
[12275.74s -> 12282.76s]  Remember the park or platform mattress to mattress. Oh that one looks so bad
[12282.76s -> 12285.32s]  Is it even gonna make it back in time for me? Where am I going?
[12285.88s -> 12290.64s]  There's a door. There's a door. There's a door right there next to you. I can't see it, man
[12291.16s -> 12294.79s]  Can you just like swim to it? No, there's I mean
[12295.49s -> 12299.01s]  Hang on. Let me see
[12299.05s -> 12301.05s]  No, no, no, you cannot
[12301.57s -> 12304.53s]  Do it you gotta do it for real
[12305.05s -> 12311.34s]  What level was it that this guy made that we played before candy land land?
[12311.34s -> 12316.38s]  Okay, maybe it gets you to jump. I mean you gotta give the guy some credit. He really covers every genre with this
[12316.38s -> 12318.74s]  Yeah, I think he also made the game
[12324.22s -> 12326.90s]  You got it you got a jump you're gonna jump from that one to that
[12329.54s -> 12334.06s]  This is never going to have our this is we have no we can totally do this this is
[12338.67s -> 12342.07s]  Hey Kraken if you go into if you go into console, can you know?
[12344.23s -> 12351.61s]  Can you wall run I just gonna hurt. Oh, yeah wall running. Can you walk on that? That's not a thing on this map
[12359.94s -> 12364.06s]  Where's the where's the other what yeah, it's like the timings off
[12366.70s -> 12368.70s]  I'm gonna get there if you got
[12369.62s -> 12374.02s]  You gotta wait. Oh hard person to completely fall before you even get on the next one or else the
[12375.34s -> 12381.14s]  I'm just gonna go. Oh my god. It's like buggy man. It's like
[12382.02s -> 12388.26s]  Yeah, it's odd you press forward and sometimes it's very weird. Sometimes you get stuck and then maybe jerk off. I'm host
[12388.26s -> 12390.26s]  It's not that bad for me, but
[12390.50s -> 12392.50s]  Soon as you get through this
[12393.06s -> 12398.51s]  One of I've now I'm too deep in no one though. I want to know how it's next
[12398.51s -> 12400.51s]  I want to hear more
[12401.39s -> 12405.69s]  It's like you move slower than the thing moves so you have to like preemptive
[12409.71s -> 12416.15s]  It's you guys you got a jitter step here if you watch how I do it here it's not the bed
[12419.33s -> 12424.77s]  I'm showing you he's like the greatest call duty gamer I've ever seen and then where's the where's the where's the door?
[12429.53s -> 12434.20s]  Now I can't now it's got to reset all the way, okay, I'm gonna get it this time
[12443.62s -> 12445.62s]  Well, that's gonna be
[12447.34s -> 12450.05s]  Give it a minute. It's not gonna be back in time
[12450.67s -> 12456.84s]  Thanks, Kraken. I think is it is it I think it might be like client-side because it was reset for me
[12458.26s -> 12463.92s]  Check under the water bugs. Oh man. Yeah, I don't even think my connection is good enough to do that
[12463.92s -> 12465.92s]  I'm running on like over 120 ping
[12466.88s -> 12469.25s]  So I think I just watch
[12470.81s -> 12472.65s]  Don't look at that
[12472.65s -> 12477.53s]  No, crank it if you actually next to one the tilt a key actually does open the real console
[12478.01s -> 12484.83s]  Recognizes no clip as a command. I don't have any cheese to not turn off my fucking flashlight again. Try typing SV cheats
[12485.33s -> 12488.32s]  It's not SV though. Is it?
[12488.84s -> 12490.84s]  Actually, it recognizes SV
[12491.32s -> 12494.96s]  Does the knife make you run it faster in this game? Oh
[12495.76s -> 12504.36s]  My god, it activated the platform to all guys take out your knives take out your knives. What does that do? You write faster?
[12504.88s -> 12512.94s]  It's just like sir. You can keep up with it. Sorry James. I'm cutting you fucking cut me. I just cut you
[12513.30s -> 12517.54s]  Ha I did I can do this. You're almost there. Oh
[12519.34s -> 12524.44s]  Hey tomato, what happened to you? I died the poison she drowned
[12525.22s -> 12530.36s]  Yeah, the knife definitely makes it easier. All right, go for it
[12530.64s -> 12532.00s]  You got it
[12532.00s -> 12541.08s]  No, I think it's I think sometimes just get lucky in the platform doesn't fuck you. I'm mine still sitting there. Yeah
[12541.08s -> 12542.04s]  Oh
[12542.04s -> 12544.04s]  You got it. You got it
[12545.92s -> 12547.92s]  There you go, there you go
[12548.88s -> 12550.56s]  What's the end goal?
[12550.56s -> 12556.28s]  When you reach the middle of that wall, right under the stops right under the P is the is the door
[12556.36s -> 12559.00s]  You got to jump at the P. Oh, okay. I see
[12559.48s -> 12562.35s]  All right. I might get this I see it now
[12562.83s -> 12567.42s]  fuck
[12567.42s -> 12570.40s]  Don't too early. Wait, if it's under the P
[12570.40s -> 12576.48s]  What's the point of that platform under the like the yellow flag? I think that might be what you need to jump to actually
[12578.48s -> 12581.56s]  That goes towards it. Oh, really?
[12585.64s -> 12593.36s]  Probably right cuz look look I'll activate it. Let me see if it does anything. Is it moving or I'm dying
[12594.24s -> 12597.80s]  Okay, I died. Let's got it. I died
[12600.60s -> 12603.48s]  Nice yes, was it taking me it didn't move. Oh
[12604.40s -> 12607.54s]  No, I don't even know if that's do it if that's gonna do anything
[12607.54s -> 12611.46s]  I thought it would move and it never did or do you have to jump from there into the hey
[12612.02s -> 12616.64s]  Crawl crawl up to what it doesn't look like you're losing time
[12618.16s -> 12625.68s]  The thing's gonna come back. Come on. Come back. All right, here we go. All right, so the last one doesn't move
[12626.96s -> 12629.84s]  It should move I it moved when I was in the wall
[12630.92s -> 12633.32s]  Maybe I need to be on it for longer, but I panicked
[12633.32s -> 12638.88s]  Maybe it gives you a second to stand on it before it moves cuz you definitely should move broken. I
[12640.80s -> 12642.80s]  Love saw
[12644.04s -> 12649.91s]  What a jump
[12650.67s -> 12654.47s]  Is it in the middle for you the rest of this is the rest of the
[12664.45s -> 12669.65s]  All right, you're there look it moves look it is moving right now. Why why is it you know?
[12670.13s -> 12675.45s]  God, who started it? I shot it what I shot it. I shot it. Oh
[12676.05s -> 12679.81s]  Yeah, oh, maybe someone else has to like do it the rest of the way you guys shoot it yourself
[12679.81s -> 12683.77s]  It's like a Mario maker level only one guy was able to do this. It was person that created it
[12685.72s -> 12688.48s]  Okay, can someone go up this ladder I'm dying of poison
[12690.12s -> 12696.44s]  All right, James you want to do it I'll shoot the thing when you're ready if I can even make it up there now jump
[12696.92s -> 12701.73s]  Why I think I'm getting decisively better at the second one though
[12702.37s -> 12707.61s]  Fuck I can't even make it to the second one. I know I feel so ready to go. I
[12708.37s -> 12710.37s]  Can't get up the fucking ladder
[12715.85s -> 12722.37s]  Holy shit imagine how satisfying the call I didn't be though. Oh, I shouldn't I think I can do that
[12722.37s -> 12725.85s]  I didn't sprint that time. You got it. You got it. I think I can actually do this
[12726.57s -> 12729.08s]  I've been getting better
[12729.08s -> 12740.68s]  Does somebody need to shoot it? All right. Yeah. Don't shoot it yet. Do not shoot it yet

[13255.96s -> 13259.56s]  Okay, this is good these are all going into the soul
[13260.44s -> 13265.84s]  We have half as much as we need for the bowie knife
[13266.44s -> 13275.20s]  So what they're gonna get closer to the toilet time. Oh god. I can't see for shit on this map. Oh

[13285.88s -> 13291.06s]  G underscore spawn no free entities. All right Game of Thrones
[13292.62s -> 13295.90s]  Didn't pay for that one. It's not that it's free
[13296.74s -> 13299.70s]  We got a we got a bill. We got a play into that
[13300.58s -> 13304.74s]  Pandering, I don't know. I'm trying to find Game of Thrones one. I don't think I see it my list
[13305.02s -> 13310.80s]  I need to read down on it. I have dead ship. I have
[13311.56s -> 13313.56s]  It's in capital letters
[13314.28s -> 13316.16s]  Called Game of Thrones

[13322.16s -> 13324.16s]  I think he might have put the wrong map in his game
[13325.04s -> 13328.76s]  But I promise guys. It's gonna be good. It looked good. Oh
[13329.76s -> 13331.76s]  Yeah, I gotta I gotta reinstall it one

[13360.88s -> 13365.92s]  Yeah, I guess you could join on Kraken everyone who doesn't I think that should work out
[13366.68s -> 13370.04s]  Okay, then Kraken you just join on me. Okay
[13370.88s -> 13374.84s]  Stairway to hell looks good

[13488.98s -> 13490.98s]  I thought this one was made by kill small
[13491.50s -> 13494.00s]  Is that a good or a bad thing? Well
[13495.16s -> 13497.40s]  What do you think I?
[13497.40s -> 13500.32s]  have this one does YouTube tutorials for
[13500.88s -> 13504.29s]  Call of Duty zombies mod making maps. So, you know, oh
[13505.33s -> 13513.79s]  I know you're with you too. You never heard of it, man. I think we should we should break in the black ops 3
[13514.23s -> 13518.43s]  YouTube scene, dude. I think we should break into tutorials in general. I don't think enough people do that
[13519.07s -> 13528.22s]  All right. I'm gonna grab a beer all ready for James. We can also probably start loading. Ah, I'm not gonna abandon James
[13528.82s -> 13530.82s]  Wait, is it we're doing a little beer?
[13535.52s -> 13538.20s]  It's getting like another drink sometimes it takes him a while
[13538.80s -> 13540.80s]  He's got bad legs, you know
[13540.92s -> 13545.96s]  I'm gonna sprint downstairs and grab a water and I'm gonna sprint back up as fast I can I'm gonna get hurt
[13546.68s -> 13551.96s]  Should I time you it's gonna be 45 seconds guarantee 45 seconds guarantee
[13552.92s -> 13555.68s]  Starting starting 10 seconds after you hear the door close
[13556.44s -> 13564.52s]  That's right here. What they have to hear the door close behind me 10 seconds. Okay. I have your back
[13634.65s -> 13642.62s]  There may have been some developments on my side, too. I know what developments happened kind of
[13644.39s -> 13647.59s]  Sideway eyes. I haven't played on the server
[13647.59s -> 13652.19s]  It says the lobbies not joinable what
[13653.71s -> 13659.50s]  There are three people in here gang that's what it says. Let me invite you
[13659.82s -> 13667.46s]  Let me give you let me give you a personal invite my friend James the head German German. Have you ever tried GTA RP?
[13667.90s -> 13669.46s]  No, never
[13669.46s -> 13671.83s]  Are you interested? Oh
[13671.87s -> 13673.31s]  probably not
[13673.31s -> 13675.31s]  Okay
[13675.87s -> 13683.28s]  Conversation and I was about as quick as we got rejected inviting people to this stream. Yeah, really? That's what you should have said
[13683.28s -> 13685.28s]  You're like, yeah
[13685.48s -> 13689.96s]  Hey, you want to do this zombies thing and probably not not really
[13692.72s -> 13699.16s]  James can you still not get in it won't let me where let me check. Let me go off the message on steam
[13699.48s -> 13704.28s]  Yeah, try that cuz uh now there are enough people in that's something weird going on
[13705.28s -> 13713.39s]  I just clicked it. It's not that I don't think it would be fun. You just don't like us. I get it
[13717.00s -> 13721.92s]  Yeah, I mean like this is the first thing you've done with us I'm like fucking I know I wouldn't blame after this
[13723.84s -> 13727.92s]  What you guys just talking about how you guys are getting like banned from the server you want me to jump in on
[13728.68s -> 13735.26s]  No, there's no drama with the admins. All right, we we know the admins. Okay. Look, we're cool with them
[13735.30s -> 13739.54s]  It's this is more of a it's a beef. All right their gang vs our gang
[13739.82s -> 13745.54s]  Dude, I did something pretty questionable last night that I that chat was my chat was telling me that I could surely get banned for
[13745.54s -> 13747.66s]  Okay, I'm not gonna speak for James. I don't know
[13749.94s -> 13754.70s]  No, but I figured it out later like someone else on the server said it was like it was all cool. I
[13756.52s -> 13760.44s]  Used information that I got from role-playing and I did something dirty. Oh
[13762.12s -> 13764.04s]  But it was from role-playing
[13764.04s -> 13766.08s]  Okay
[13766.12s -> 13770.30s]  Everything my character does is dear. It's great. I'm gonna have to host since James can't join my game
[13771.24s -> 13777.72s]  I'm trying to accept your invite. It's just keep saying can't join try it try joining like off of yeah
[13777.72s -> 13780.12s]  I go put me or join. I think that's how I did it
[13780.76s -> 13788.65s]  Well, I'll be not joinable. What the fuck is it there try it again. There is everywhere errors
[13789.61s -> 13796.52s]  Maybe I mean cracking as long as we know that map like appears or something for you that you know
[13796.84s -> 13799.00s]  It's labeled as Game of Thrones on the map list
[13799.00s -> 13803.28s]  Well, I'm sure that I'm not gonna be able to find it in my own lobby for some reason. It's still not working
[13803.28s -> 13804.88s]  I'm gonna host again
[13804.88s -> 13807.44s]  Yeah, let's see if you can find it. It's like all caps Game of Thrones
[13809.72s -> 13817.06s]  Chad am I blind or is versus thing you subscribe to everything like that. I sent you most recently
[13817.06s -> 13820.42s]  I think so, but I have most of it there that one was pretty
[13820.70s -> 13823.78s]  That one might have been one of the last ones on that list in the collection
[13823.78s -> 13826.95s]  I might have had the same issue as some of people were my
[13827.71s -> 13829.35s]  There is it
[13829.35s -> 13834.61s]  Okay, I was about GT RP. It's just a bunch of cringy dudes. That's the point man. Oh, dude
[13835.01s -> 13838.67s]  They got my number we can all be cringy together. That's right
[13838.91s -> 13845.67s]  We're just as cringy in the server as we are IRL cringy
[13854.08s -> 13856.76s]  There we go it worked
[13856.80s -> 13864.73s]  I'm gonna make that problem James. What's your problem with me steam filters only true friends tomato. What the fuck? All right, let's go
[13866.19s -> 13869.13s]  I'm sorry. Are you guys ready for us?
[13869.17s -> 13873.87s]  By the way, it says this game thrown spoilers if you've never seen the show don't watch the spoilers
[13875.21s -> 13877.69s]  You know, I actually don't know how many spoilers this might have
[13878.41s -> 13883.31s]  Pretty good warning if you've seen the first episode you you should probably be good
[13883.87s -> 13886.27s]  Yeah, watch just come here all of a sudden
[13888.60s -> 13894.54s]  Chad told me to turn on dev mode so I can use cheats and that may have broken some of these maps because I did
[13894.54s -> 13900.50s]  You like yours. Why do you listen? Are you cheating? I do even know how to undo that. No breaking stuff. Oh
[13901.06s -> 13903.06s]  Wow
[13904.62s -> 13909.02s]  White walkers what the go back to castle black

[13936.45s -> 13940.99s]  Because I was not playable why did you open a thing called
[13941.99s -> 13943.99s]  Online
[13944.23s -> 13948.47s]  His chat was like that's how you can know clear friend. They teach you

[13965.11s -> 13970.23s]  I like the voice acting in the wall. They couldn't put the elevator in so they just made it stairs, which is okay
[13970.27s -> 13971.75s]  I guess
[13971.75s -> 13975.70s]  Dev mode
[13975.70s -> 13981.38s]  Mods enable a mode only mode. I don't watch out for you. I don't know how watch out for my mic

[14032.35s -> 14034.35s]  You know how you can have multiple
[14035.91s -> 14038.27s]  Screens like, you know, everyone's got multiple monitors, right?
[14038.87s -> 14047.88s]  so the idea is we're gonna stream with display capture and one of the monitors that it's off-screen is me playing porn the
[14047.88s -> 14049.88s]  entire stream and
[14050.08s -> 14054.38s]  You just have to ignore it and have it muted and like
[14054.76s -> 14058.04s]  It's just gonna be on the whole time and everyone's gonna know it's there
[14058.04s -> 14060.44s]  But as long as it's not on-screen, you can't get in trouble for it, right?
[14063.64s -> 14066.68s]  Fucking stuff glitches out first or something and fucking me
[14066.68s -> 14072.60s]  It's just like top and just like this this mental game of like watching chat and on the other side of the monitor
[14072.60s -> 14074.20s]  We take your heart. Oh, no, we did
[14074.20s -> 14080.00s]  I remember we also established the rule that you had to be you had to have a source open for desktop capture on the
[14080.04s -> 14082.04s]  Desktop next to it. Yeah
[14082.88s -> 14087.39s]  Jason desktop has to have capture. It's playing a
[14087.91s -> 14090.41s]  dance with death
[14090.49s -> 14094.53s]  The only way I know how to feel alive anymore. Exactly. All right, how are we?
[14095.05s -> 14101.37s]  Are we ready to I'd like yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we're just I mean I should I should porn on stream before I got an infraction
[14101.37s -> 14103.73s]  And that's it. I didn't get banned. Yes
[14104.49s -> 14106.49s]  porn on stream before I
[14106.49s -> 14110.37s]  Remember this stretch when you were streaming where it seemed like you had infraction the other day
[14110.45s -> 14113.73s]  Yeah, I think that was that was during that time. Yes
[14113.73s -> 14118.21s]  It was like a there was like this stretch where you're always like on an infraction or the context to it

[14130.57s -> 14134.41s]  It was like a fake website or something. Oh, no, and I and I pulled it up and it was real
[14145.97s -> 14147.97s]  That was probably the first one ever
[14149.09s -> 14154.09s]  I mean, there's no way that wasn't taken by that dates back to like 1996
[14154.33s -> 14160.41s]  That's an old one. I got a slap on the wrist for it. All right, you guys can release the mode only mode

[14893.42s -> 14898.88s]  What if we just sit here and let it get to zero they're running they're running off the side of the
[14899.88s -> 14902.88s]  Didn't want to live anymore. Hey, no crash. That's it's pretty good

[14968.70s -> 14974.71s]  Shoutout to Simbo for his support
[14979.86s -> 14984.89s]  So cinematic
[14984.89s -> 14992.36s]  Maybe we should let them get in here first because then they have a chance to drop the pack of punch and that thing like
[14993.00s -> 14995.00s]  Save my ass. That is true
[14997.20s -> 15001.17s]  Yeah

[15021.45s -> 15025.74s]  My favorite part favorite part. Oh, there it is
[15030.89s -> 15032.89s]  I feel like none of us get quicker by
[15034.96s -> 15038.44s]  So wait, you can if you go down you just get right back up
[15038.72s -> 15041.96s]  No, it means that we can basically res each other in like a quarter of a second
[15041.96s -> 15043.96s]  It means I would have been able to res you
[15044.00s -> 15045.20s]  Okay
[15045.20s -> 15047.00s]  Pretty much if I had it
[15047.00s -> 15048.86s]  Yeah, what?

[15248.49s -> 15250.21s]  I'm going by
[15250.21s -> 15256.16s]  It's so bad to be stuck at like the end point and like the middle point. Yeah, it really is
[15257.08s -> 15261.16s]  We got times to get back time to get those points in lads
[15262.48s -> 15267.52s]  Time to get those points in lads. I love this game
[15272.76s -> 15275.20s]  It's time to get those points in life
[15283.22s -> 15285.22s]  Sudden change in momentum
[15286.89s -> 15288.89s]  sudden change in my momentum
[15290.17s -> 15294.26s]  And swing faster Wow, who's gonna open? Are you gonna hold for a while?
[15295.02s -> 15297.02s]  Hold for a bit. Oh, you wanna hold it? Okay
[15297.62s -> 15302.22s]  Looks like it's pretty much whenever James wants to go. He's got double or make it this max ammo here
[15304.22s -> 15308.22s]  The gods are with us dude, that's actually so good Thunder gun to clear the lane
[15309.94s -> 15314.78s]  Yeah time to get those points in lads there it is again
[15316.14s -> 15321.57s]  We get some good yellow line are we not gonna get like, uh, oh wait, this isn't the joke
[15321.97s -> 15324.95s]  Yeah, we got to keep pushing up. We might be able to just reach it
[15325.45s -> 15327.09s]  Start buying
[15327.09s -> 15331.84s]  Crikey, where you going, dude? Oh, we're going up. Okay, we're almost to the end of the wave
[15331.84s -> 15334.56s]  We might as well start going up now. All right, who wants to do it?
[15335.24s -> 15341.32s]  James gets first. How much further is this route? They just don't seem to stop coming. I'm not buying any new guns
[15341.32s -> 15347.44s]  I had like 13,000. We should have saved to get the bigger ones. Yeah, I'll get this one
[15348.48s -> 15353.19s]  Come on boys. They're gonna start spawning behind us. We don't get up to this corner. I just opened the next wave
[15353.19s -> 15355.35s]  Oh, there you go. What is that? Oh, they're spawning
[15355.91s -> 15357.91s]  What is that?
[15358.27s -> 15363.99s]  The power-up get it for your sword. Let's just stand here. It didn't do anything to the sword. That's bad
[15368.39s -> 15373.75s]  What is fireworks standing like this corner, yeah, let's crouch they can shoot over me
[15375.35s -> 15377.39s]  We're gonna nuclear shame on you
[15378.15s -> 15383.14s]  Shame on you. Yeah, this is a shitty spot to can't because of those ones spot in the corner
[15383.14s -> 15387.38s]  You just open up this next one. I can get it here because like they all spawn
[15388.26s -> 15392.70s]  All right. Okay James like right behind you. There's a good the next one
[15393.40s -> 15397.08s]  Right behind me. Yeah, they spawn like under you. Let's not get the nice one yet
[15397.08s -> 15402.48s]  Let's let's hold it here for a bit for sure far. Yes farm, baby. Does anyone have a juggernaut?
[15404.96s -> 15408.74s]  Okay, I think it's one more door this was really good for farming I remember this
[15409.70s -> 15415.36s]  I tell we didn't ran out of ammo. That was problem. Yeah, I got thunder gun this time. So forget max ammo down there
[15416.56s -> 15421.88s]  So tell me if you see yes, I'll let him come all the way up then or you know as far up as we can
[15422.36s -> 15424.82s]  All right there
[15424.82s -> 15428.32s]  Yeah, some points for short of an infinite ammo. There you go
[15433.30s -> 15436.91s]  That that's pretty cheap at the pulse gun
[15437.71s -> 15441.62s]  Things awesome. I don't think anything in the spa. There's another power-ups down here
[15442.38s -> 15450.25s]  The hell was that dead gun. Yeah, it's going in the middle now
[15453.99s -> 15457.27s]  All right, we want to be want to stay here on a farm what I'm gonna do I
[15457.79s -> 15460.93s]  Think we stay here for a little bit longer because we have plenty of ammo right now
[15461.51s -> 15465.13s]  As long as we don't stand any further than where James is since that's what the enemies
[15465.95s -> 15470.25s]  We're good to like just hang out here. I can clear it if it gets too dangerous in one
[15471.25s -> 15474.00s]  Nobody spots behind all right
[15474.24s -> 15477.88s]  Besides the more money we make right now the faster we just push straight to the top. That's true
[15477.96s -> 15483.86s]  Somebody needs like with 13,000 and like 11,000 for the next one to think yeah
[15486.00s -> 15491.10s]  All there's another pack of punch they won't have a gun. Oh, let me thunder gun. Do you hear me? Yeah
[15492.46s -> 15498.22s]  Right. Oh god, what was that? It's lagged get it. Yeah, I got it. I'm just trying to get past the zombie
[15499.10s -> 15501.98s]  The Zeus cannon wag
[15502.46s -> 15505.20s]  That shit's strong. Oh it is
[15505.84s -> 15507.84s]  Yeah, I can like clear the entire road with this
[15509.24s -> 15519.84s]  There's still bum rushing through. Oh shit. Nothing is insane. Yeah cold like double the ammo, too
[15522.08s -> 15529.27s]  I'm running low on ammo. By the way, you still have your sword. Nope. Oh
[15530.51s -> 15534.59s]  The sword actually works pretty well. That's a good if you don't have a mo thing. It's great
[15535.03s -> 15538.54s]  Wish I kept mine. Oh, I don't miss mine
[15539.66s -> 15545.88s]  Don't expect me to like something's getting you out of shit
[15549.34s -> 15551.34s]  I'm gonna buy the next thing

[15586.87s -> 15589.51s]  10,000. I'll die. I'll die. I'll get it
[15590.19s -> 15594.03s]  God, I'm glad I still have it for this thing
[15594.63s -> 15599.68s]  We're gonna do it. Keep going up. I can't get it money. Keep going up buddy. Go

[15610.55s -> 15612.55s]  So if we absolutely need it just so we can buy
[15613.23s -> 15617.59s]  I'm putting my thunder gun away for a bit to make some cash. Yes
[15618.35s -> 15623.08s]  James tell me if you're getting really low on health. Okay. Yes

[15661.16s -> 15662.72s]  Beautiful. Thank you
[15662.72s -> 15669.34s]  That's up. You guys are standing a little bit ahead of the spawn point. Yeah
[15669.34s -> 15682.62s]  I still don't know what the fuck fireworks even does for my sword
[15683.30s -> 15694.18s]  I wonder what so where's the end is the next two more after this or what?
[15694.18s -> 15697.30s]  It's got to be a cut. It's got to be like pretty much where we were. I think
[15700.38s -> 15703.82s]  Push for it time to get those points in lads
[15705.46s -> 15709.86s]  Let's get those points in lads those points in lads I

[15753.57s -> 15759.49s]  Walking away, we should go up an axe and we're going to fall short of ammo. We got it. Well, let's get you
[15766.69s -> 15768.61s]  All right, it's everyone good on chugging dog

[15899.89s -> 15902.25s]  I'm gonna make a crawler out of one of these white walkers
[15905.41s -> 15907.41s]  What an unexplainable encounter
[15908.09s -> 15910.89s]  Is there any? Oh, there's a max ammo over here a
[15911.69s -> 15917.13s]  Free one to manage. I wouldn't take it yet. Actually actually i'm pretty low on zeus cannon. We might as well
[15917.13s -> 15919.85s]  That's yeah, that's why I figured you get it. What the fuck just happened now
[15921.29s -> 15923.29s]  Coming

[15947.26s -> 15949.26s]  Fire
[15951.10s -> 15956.22s]  Oh there we're locked in here don't take that max ammo yet. I'm not it's like a sequence

[15962.14s -> 15964.14s]  No
[15974.78s -> 15976.78s]  The seven more
[15986.49s -> 15990.57s]  Now at least we have to go is that seven one two three four, but that's like 30
[15990.57s -> 15995.05s]  I don't have to pay my hbo subscription. I know how it ends. We already know no
[15996.41s -> 15999.29s]  That's not seven
[15999.29s -> 16001.13s]  I'm this is i'm
[16001.13s -> 16004.17s]  I'm a little bit disappointed that we didn't manage to do a single damage on the dragon
[16004.17s -> 16008.17s]  We didn't do one damage on him. We did one damage. I don't see anything on his bar
[16008.17s -> 16011.85s]  It looks like we didn't do any damage. It's all right. We'll be okay james
[16011.85s -> 16016.17s]  You could probably res me if you ran over to me fast. I think they're flying. They are so fast
[16016.73s -> 16023.37s]  This is i believe in you because you're you're faster james take out those six there's only six what's the problem
[16025.21s -> 16027.21s]  There's only six left james
[16027.53s -> 16029.69s]  Yeah, there's only six left dude. There's only five now
[16030.65s -> 16033.69s]  Fucking get them more on top. They just spawn on top. Okay
[16034.81s -> 16035.93s]  Why
[16035.93s -> 16040.09s]  Why'd you tell me to do that? I'm sorry james. I guess i'll leave now
[16042.89s -> 16045.38s]  Let me get up right there after that
[16046.86s -> 16048.06s]  Hey, I mean
[16048.06s -> 16054.06s]  They made a level about game of thrones. That was pretty good. I mean the dragon trick custom drag model got a hand
[16054.86s -> 16056.86s]  Yeah
[16057.50s -> 16059.50s]  Like that
[16059.82s -> 16063.10s]  Did you hear that at the end? Yeah, it's been
[16064.86s -> 16068.46s]  Oh, I thought that was one of you guys. No, that wasn't us. That was the map
[16068.70s -> 16072.14s]  No, that was a good map that that wasn't just like t-posing bowser in the corner
[16073.10s -> 16076.38s]  Speaking of t-posing bowser, let's do five nights at freddy's next god
[16077.98s -> 16080.86s]  That's a jump. That's a jump scare one. Yeah, let's do that. Oh, hell. Yeah
[16081.58s -> 16085.99s]  This one actually have jumped to jump schism
[16087.35s -> 16090.17s]  This is gonna be a scary one
[16090.17s -> 16092.17s]  It might be scary warning you
[16103.06s -> 16109.46s]  By the killer s be the killer gonna put a face game off of this one. Yeah, that's right. You should that's true
[16110.41s -> 16112.41s]  Yeah, let me get it on
[16114.95s -> 16131.77s]  Not for me guys, you know, I don't have i haven't done a face reveal yet. Someone's got a lot of graphics. It's uh
[16132.97s -> 16134.97s]  We didn't ask smile
[16135.69s -> 16136.81s]  Okay

[16146.17s -> 16149.77s]  You got kicked. I got kicked out. Did you not install this one?
[16150.87s -> 16152.87s]  I installed the pack. I mean
[16154.78s -> 16159.42s]  Was it in the pack? It should be in the pack, right back. All right. Oh, it's in the pack
[16160.30s -> 16163.69s]  What the heck happened?
[16163.69s -> 16167.21s]  It still says i'm in your game too. It's still loading for me
[16167.29s -> 16172.17s]  I'm not sure how much the dev of this map possibly put in that it should still be loading for me
[16175.08s -> 16177.08s]  Hmm. Yeah, i'm wondering that too
[16177.32s -> 16182.44s]  How much lore did they jam pack into this? Well, do you think the reason there's no ratings?
[16183.24s -> 16187.32s]  Is because it's shit. Well, I knew that is there another five. Yeah, so I warned you

[16360.33s -> 16362.97s]  We're just not compatible too a good one

[16385.08s -> 16387.08s]  Press join game see if we get it
[16387.32s -> 16396.89s]  I love it when my mic gets all quiet and everyone's like ready to go, you know
[16398.60s -> 16400.60s]  Lobby is not joinable. What are you?
[16400.76s -> 16402.76s]  Is not joinable
[16404.52s -> 16407.34s]  All right, guys, come on come on
[16412.97s -> 16414.97s]  All right
[16415.05s -> 16416.25s]  now
[16416.25s -> 16419.29s]  It's time to spend five nights at freddy's
[16420.17s -> 16424.25s]  Be careful to get scared. Give it five minutes at freddy's and then we're switching to monopoly
[16424.65s -> 16429.05s]  Oh, you guys are gonna be really excited about this one what I saw it looks like a good one
[16429.61s -> 16432.25s]  You know, I thought it was called friday nights at freddy's for about
[16433.13s -> 16434.33s]  Two years
[16434.33s -> 16439.61s]  What friday nights at freddy's? Yeah, I mean that was like friday fridays friday is pizza night
[16439.69s -> 16441.69s]  I was like, yeah, it's a pizza place
[16442.01s -> 16444.01s]  I mean that but that wouldn't be wrong
[16444.41s -> 16447.21s]  Right. Yeah, I mean you spend what a week there
[16447.69s -> 16451.05s]  You'd spend at least one of those days one of them is friday at least one of them is friday
[16451.13s -> 16456.81s]  Probably unless you start on a on saturday sunday in which case you'd probably get off right before that's true
[16457.77s -> 16459.77s]  You somehow skip the friday
[16459.93s -> 16461.93s]  You skip friday
[16462.41s -> 16468.30s]  I think we've reached the same spot as last time. Oh my god. I did it again
[16468.86s -> 16469.66s]  Yeah
[16469.66s -> 16470.62s]  I think
[16470.62s -> 16475.50s]  The only way that we make this work is that james hosts we join on james because he's the only one that's confirmed
[16475.74s -> 16477.74s]  Had a usable map version of this
[16478.46s -> 16482.30s]  How the fuck tricky tricky tricky stuff. Is there anything I need to change?
[16482.46s -> 16487.10s]  Uh under the private but kraken does need to kraken needs to release us like yeah
[16487.10s -> 16491.02s]  Like spirit so he has to close his game to release us so we don't have to restart
[16491.26s -> 16496.95s]  Yeah, you're you're released go go forth prosper I still have the the game up I guess
[16497.75s -> 16501.03s]  It'll release us in a moment. I don't know. I'm stuck forever. It's gone
[16501.83s -> 16503.83s]  No, trust it trust it
[16504.15s -> 16507.21s]  God, I hope they make more board game maps. I don't give a shit about any of this
[16507.21s -> 16510.89s]  I just want like not like nazi zombie yahtzee, you know, I like
[16511.61s -> 16512.73s]  Yahtzee
[16512.73s -> 16514.33s]  I want them to cover everything
[16514.33s -> 16520.81s]  It's like rng based where you keep rolling the dice the monopoly one does have rolling. I know that i'm almost positive
[16521.77s -> 16525.45s]  You you you pay like 500 bucks and it rolls the dice for you and you
[16527.13s -> 16528.81s]  Yahtzee zombies
[16528.81s -> 16533.69s]  Not that's pretty good. That's pretty good. How is it not there yet? Somebody that's perfect
[16534.25s -> 16536.65s]  Come on someone hop to it. Wait a minute
[16537.45s -> 16539.69s]  Let me look it up a friend of mine
[16540.41s -> 16545.45s]  Uh recently turned 24 and he said what he did for his birthday is he played yahtzee
[16546.33s -> 16550.73s]  That was his that was what that was his activity. That's not bad. Yeah, you know, it's a good night
[16550.97s -> 16556.49s]  It's a good game. It's a fun game. You just dice around and shake it up in the container. It makes the cool satisfying noise
[16557.61s -> 16559.78s]  Maybe you get them right maybe get them wrong
[16564.58s -> 16567.86s]  All right, so well it finally released me from my torment
[16570.49s -> 16572.49s]  It released us from
[16576.15s -> 16582.15s]  You want to play a game stop dude, I don't leave my mic peaked when I do the bit
[16582.23s -> 16585.03s]  You know, that's the thing with the bit is that I turn it down after
[16586.94s -> 16588.94s]  All right, james. Let's uh
[16589.42s -> 16590.78s]  My should be major
[16590.78s -> 16595.18s]  It should be up. I guess if uh, if kraken wants to join in first, I guess he could
[16595.82s -> 16600.30s]  No, I think i'll join in because i'm your friend on steam and i'm done. Holy shit. It worked. Look at that
[16600.62s -> 16604.86s]  I'm finished with you saying that we're not friends. Are we get in are we are we good?
[16606.38s -> 16608.38s]  Do you have james on no, I don't have
[16608.38s -> 16610.38s]  The guy
[16610.62s -> 16612.94s]  Okay, I have like two people on steam
[16614.22s -> 16616.12s]  the rest is like
[16616.12s -> 16618.12s]  7 000 notifications from when he's
[16625.22s -> 16629.22s]  Turning it down too low like you should remember what it's at. No, it's it's automatic
[16629.46s -> 16633.70s]  First it goes full volume and then it goes to 60 and I turn it back up to 90
[16633.78s -> 16635.78s]  I'm joining off you kraken. Hopefully you're in there
[16636.68s -> 16638.87s]  Oh, he's in
[16638.87s -> 16642.71s]  Dude, let's play this five nights at freddy's five nights seven
[16643.35s -> 16644.39s]  six
[16644.39s -> 16645.35s]  five
[16645.35s -> 16654.36s]  Four how the fuck does that make any sense that it would have to be me as host to fucking get it to load up
[16654.44s -> 16655.32s]  I don't know all we well
[16655.32s -> 16659.40s]  I mean all I know is that you're the only person of the four of us that loaded the map and got in it
[16659.40s -> 16663.88s]  You know, okay. Wait, how many of us here has done a five nights at freddy's video razor? I have
[16664.84s -> 16669.96s]  I I have was this was this a trap? I put my hand back down. I technically I technically didn't
[16670.84s -> 16675.64s]  You technically did I did not i'm the only one I am the only one that this is a new experience for me
[16675.64s -> 16679.40s]  I didn't make it. Well, I mean i've seen the game and i've played it on a video. Okay
[16680.76s -> 16683.32s]  I I had connections back when five nights at freddy's came out
[16683.32s -> 16686.60s]  I got like early access to the second game and the third game. Oh shit
[16686.60s -> 16689.80s]  You know that guy the guy that made it. I didn't know the guy that made it
[16689.80s -> 16693.08s]  But I knew a guy that knew the guy that made it. So they said luke am I in or crash?
[16693.32s -> 16695.88s]  I think it might be crashed
[16695.88s -> 16698.84s]  Yeah, I don't think it worked for me. I think i'm i'm probably the problem child
[16699.80s -> 16700.68s]  It's waiting for yeah
[16700.68s -> 16704.44s]  I mean, it's not letting maybe this is only a single player map because I don't remember there being four other like
[16704.60s -> 16709.56s]  Schmucks in five nights at freddy's it also got stuck again for me too. It just says awaiting textures
[16709.88s -> 16713.40s]  Maybe this isn't multiplayer. Maybe we have to settle for monopoly
[16714.52s -> 16718.52s]  Settle, he said but I gotta turn the webcam off. Sorry guys
[16720.12s -> 16722.12s]  Yeah, I mean I could

[17151.51s -> 17154.01s]  I'm gonna lean into the mic

[17176.54s -> 17178.54s]  What wait, what do you mean?
[17180.38s -> 17186.54s]  I guess it wasn't a tune. Did you just realize it was wrong? Yeah, it's it's different the tone goes a little
[17188.62s -> 17195.11s]  I'm opening the game back up one elaborate one elaborate fucking bit
[17195.59s -> 17199.11s]  I thought I thought it was dead and dead dead. Uh, right
[17201.83s -> 17204.01s]  Yeah, it's a little different than that
[17206.01s -> 17208.57s]  Oh, oh he's lpb farming, right?
[17210.49s -> 17212.49s]  He's stealing our shits
[17218.10s -> 17221.70s]  I got too excited about all those new all those new comedy people
[17222.66s -> 17224.66s]  comedy people
[17225.06s -> 17228.02s]  Wait, why am I in your how am I in your lobby? But you're not like actually in a lot
[17229.14s -> 17234.18s]  Why are you in my lobby? I thought you were hosting dude. Let's turn on let's turn on black ops 3 multiplayer
[17234.66s -> 17240.50s]  Yeah, I got really excited really fast and then sometimes I get a little worked up it's okay. Yeah, you sir. Yeah, that's all right
[17241.98s -> 17247.18s]  You know, it's honestly the most jarring thing we could possibly do at this point play an actual call of duty black ops 3 zombie
[17247.18s -> 17250.30s]  Level and just see how fucking shit every other one die
[17251.50s -> 17253.50s]  Honestly, I can't even go back now at this point
[17253.50s -> 17257.66s]  Yeah, yeah, I never started to begin with I can't I think I can do that ever for the no
[17258.78s -> 17260.78s]  This is the only experience
[17260.86s -> 17262.62s]  it's like imagine
[17262.62s -> 17264.38s]  Imagine play imagine all these levels
[17264.38s -> 17271.02s]  But they've jam-packed about 20 000 times more needless complexity into zombies like for every actual level
[17271.42s -> 17275.66s]  There's like a billion different things you're supposed to do a thousand easter eggs
[17276.14s -> 17281.02s]  Every map is supposed to last like four months. It's insane and awful
[17281.74s -> 17283.51s]  honestly
[17283.51s -> 17286.63s]  And other people that play zombies in it. Yeah haven't some levels they just
[17287.35s -> 17289.35s]  They marathon lasted forever
[17289.91s -> 17294.55s]  They last forever and some levels might as well be like small cities at this point
[17294.63s -> 17299.19s]  You know one of them the what the first one in this game actually is a small city
[17299.43s -> 17305.19s]  You have to take a fucking bus to get to spots of it. It's like a it's like transit
[17305.27s -> 17311.32s]  It's like it's more chores. It's more chores than taking trams than it is playing the level. Oh my god
[17312.55s -> 17318.60s]  Imagine that zombies in time. Oh, we're we're doing this again. Right? Okay, I forgot
[17319.56s -> 17324.02s]  So someday german when you're in a conversation with someone at a party and they're like, oh I love nazis played
[17324.50s -> 17326.74s]  And you have to think you have to think to yourself
[17327.14s -> 17329.14s]  How do I answer this?
[17329.54s -> 17334.18s]  If you say yes, he's in mario kart version. How do you how do you relate to it?
[17334.50s -> 17338.98s]  You just pretend you'd be like, yeah, I could because I know about the boxes and buying and stuff
[17339.54s -> 17342.04s]  I'm first. I'm first. I'm first
[17342.04s -> 17344.04s]  No, you're not anymore boy

[17349.02s -> 17350.78s]  Oh, this sounds awful
[17351.48s -> 17353.48s]  Why is my engine stuttering like this?
[17353.72s -> 17359.03s]  Damn, I was gonna knock you off the road, man
[17360.34s -> 17365.80s]  I knew there was a turn coming up. I couldn't do that forever. I love how the music's so temporary
[17366.66s -> 17368.82s]  What the fuck? I mean we have to make money
[17369.78s -> 17372.15s]  We can't even open this until we make some money
[17373.51s -> 17379.43s]  I've I found something. All right, everyone. Let's make some money at the beginning of the level. There's something back here
[17380.23s -> 17380.95s]  Oh
[17380.95s -> 17384.63s]  Jesus christ, why'd that zombie jump? I knew you were gonna be fine
[17386.71s -> 17390.39s]  I mean, we should never be caught because we can run there's so much space to run
[17393.51s -> 17398.87s]  Somebody just said this looks like a shitty mobile game
[17402.71s -> 17409.50s]  One of like the 4 000 ipad versions of this game how do we get up here? It's the kill
[17410.30s -> 17413.38s]  There's the music

[18215.78s -> 18218.78s]  What do you guys think?
[18218.78s -> 18223.36s]  Because I don't think with this tree here we can finish. I don't think it's possible
[18223.92s -> 18229.36s]  So I think you're supposed to get up here you're supposed to probably get the ramp ramp over ramp up here
[18230.40s -> 18233.95s]  But I mean like I did the lap technically
[18236.08s -> 18238.25s]  Yeah, I guess we did
[18238.25s -> 18241.53s]  Oh look up here. It says I fucking hate this map
[18242.49s -> 18247.29s]  Oh, well, that's a good enough sign for me. I think it's time to play taco bell

[18362.32s -> 18366.64s]  I don't know what the fuck this man. I don't know how to explain this to you, but I don't think I care what they do
[18368.40s -> 18371.36s]  You're trying to fucking win the race. No, I want to go
[18371.60s -> 18374.56s]  I want kraken to close the lobby, but he keeps on telling me to race
[18375.52s -> 18381.12s]  There must be a winner I feel like I won. Can we go? Someone has to win
[18382.40s -> 18386.64s]  I can't fuck. Oh, wait quick. Look look Mario. Oh
[18388.08s -> 18390.08s]  Wait, i'm alive. What am I alive?
[18391.28s -> 18393.28s]  Why are we alive? We can win this
[18394.80s -> 18400.72s]  What did they just trade his life for ours? We sacrificed him to the giant mario statue
[18401.68s -> 18404.75s]  What the fuck now is our time
[18405.47s -> 18409.79s]  It's the time to shine. Oh, we're going backwards. They're going the wrong way. I'm gonna get this cold

[18415.60s -> 18417.60s]  I think are we going the wrong way?
[18417.84s -> 18420.30s]  I think it's the right way
[18420.30s -> 18424.86s]  Oh, there's so many what the fuck. Yeah, no way you're gonna get swarmed
[18425.50s -> 18430.62s]  They're all treated. I just spit all over myself. Hey, I got insta kill for you guys. Oh, wait

[18457.18s -> 18460.78s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's that's where there it is. This is this is the lip. This is the lip
[18460.86s -> 18463.66s]  Okay, where where is mario's location? All right, I
[18464.62s -> 18466.62s]  Is it this this way
[18467.58s -> 18471.82s]  Where's the center? The center is that way, right? I'm gonna start spinning around. All right, you just start
[18472.62s -> 18478.75s]  Just start spinning around. I'll tell you east. He's east which way which east
[18479.07s -> 18487.95s]  I'll put hold him think about east is it could be anybody's east. Why is that actually under there?
[18488.80s -> 18491.84s]  How do I capitalize on that and find him in kraken's honor?
[18493.04s -> 18495.04s]  It's right. I don't know where east is
[18495.52s -> 18497.52s]  It's on the other end of the tunnel there he is
[18499.77s -> 18501.13s]  um
[18501.13s -> 18507.53s]  What the fuck is everyone else dead? Is it just me? I don't have any money. Can we win the race? Did I win?
[18508.09s -> 18512.49s]  Yeah, you won. I don't really want to grind money to do this mario bit. Honestly
[18513.13s -> 18515.13s]  I don't think the lpb is gonna

[18532.57s -> 18534.57s]  You can pull like the mario t-post from like
[18535.37s -> 18536.57s]  wii u
[18536.57s -> 18538.57s]  For sure. Oh
[18538.65s -> 18539.93s]  crashing

[18542.09s -> 18544.19s]  All right. How you guys feeling do I do one more?
[18544.19s -> 18547.15s]  I don't want to hold you guys hostage if you're all burnt out from

[18557.39s -> 18559.39s]  When are we doing?
[18561.71s -> 18566.11s]  We heard monopoly monopoly so much fun we've never gotten past like the second wave of monopoly, but
[18566.67s -> 18569.31s]  I mean, this might be the crew. We might have trained enough
[18570.19s -> 18572.27s]  Oh, I think we've trained enough
[18576.14s -> 18578.14s]  I can hear him swallowing tomato
[18578.54s -> 18580.54s]  Dude get out of my fucking ears
[18581.34s -> 18582.86s]  I'm just
[18582.86s -> 18587.18s]  I'm just waiting that's the kind of microphone that you can hear the person's mom trying to talk to them
[18587.66s -> 18589.74s]  You they're in like the xbox lobby and you hear like
[18591.18s -> 18594.06s]  You want this or that? No, I'll take uh, yeah, I want
[18595.18s -> 18597.10s]  Yeah, i'll take the chicken
[18597.10s -> 18598.30s]  All right
[18598.30s -> 18602.22s]  It's not on me. You hear them like smoking you can hear them smoking fucking cigarettes
[18604.41s -> 18607.21s]  You guys have been able to hear that before you can you ever hear somebody else in the room?
[18607.93s -> 18611.69s]  Smoking cigarettes like not the person that's in the lobby the person like on their couch
[18614.36s -> 18617.40s]  Yeah, I swear to god like 20 feet away. Yeah, you just hear like
[18621.92s -> 18624.08s]  I can hear it. I swear to god. I've never had that
[18631.23s -> 18643.82s]  Monopoly dude, you guys haven't gotten past wave two
[18644.46s -> 18647.42s]  It's so hard. Wow
[18647.42s -> 18651.42s]  We didn't have enough. I think we're also cracking was that last time we did this
[18651.42s -> 18654.94s]  We only had three people and did we have more this was the first one we did last time
[18655.84s -> 18659.84s]  You know, how many people did we have when we did it? I think we had three. Yeah, so we were not
[18659.84s -> 18663.20s]  Yeah, we were short a guy. We were short a guy and we were not we had no idea what we were doing
[18663.20s -> 18668.08s]  So all right. Well, hey what what how about why don't we do taco bell first and and give a two minute time?
[18668.72s -> 18674.08s]  You want to warm up the tuck? All right, we'll start with taco bell. Let's start with a three minute time talk about kfc because
[18674.64s -> 18679.92s]  All right. I'll be honest. There's there's mcdonald's 1.0. There's taco bell 2.0 and kfc 3.0
[18679.92s -> 18684.96s]  All I can say about mcdonald's is definitely the best map, but I think taco bell has the best
[18686.00s -> 18687.04s]  You know
[18687.04s -> 18692.24s]  Presence taco bell then taco bell was the one that won the vote. Okay. All right deal
[18693.20s -> 18696.24s]  Yeah, we don't have to do the whole thing working drive-through. It's just so on the features
[18696.48s -> 18698.00s]  Look every time I have taco bell
[18698.00s -> 18698.72s]  I'm like
[18698.72s -> 18703.36s]  This is going to be the time that I enjoy taco bell and every time I get sick and I wish I didn't have taco bell
[18704.08s -> 18706.08s]  What are you ordering?
[18707.77s -> 18711.13s]  There's no way you can't enjoy it if it's completely digitalized, you know
[18711.45s -> 18714.01s]  What are your favorite things on the menu favorite things on the taco bell menu?
[18714.65s -> 18717.29s]  I don't know because i've been sick every time i've had any of those. I would say

[19143.13s -> 19145.29s]  God damn. Oh, i'm physically looking
[19146.56s -> 19150.56s]  Yeah, looking instead of zombies. They're implying that the zombies are customers
[19151.12s -> 19153.12s]  I get it mexi fries
[19154.16s -> 19156.16s]  Hold on a minute. This stuff isn't even real

[19162.80s -> 19168.00s]  Mexi fries mexi fries. No, those are real. I had someone talking about those earlier today in my chat. I saw it
[19168.72s -> 19171.68s]  Someone brought up mexi fries. They took them off of the menu. I don't know why
[19172.32s -> 19175.20s]  But they actually removed they executed them recently from the menu
[19176.64s -> 19182.88s]  I know they had they must exist because someone someone talked about them and there's no way they sell cigars
[19184.08s -> 19186.08s]  Look at no
[19187.12s -> 19191.68s]  No beef burrito. Look at that. That's a that's a nice cigar
[19192.40s -> 19194.08s]  Look at the bottom
[19194.08s -> 19196.08s]  Yeah, I see it. Oh

[19211.45s -> 19216.22s]  50 people behind me trying to punch me all the way down underground
[19217.55s -> 19219.55s]  Did you guys ever understand that when people do that shit?
[19223.74s -> 19228.24s]  Oh, I definitely don't have time to get you it's like a thousand guys

[19257.04s -> 19260.96s]  Could this guy not get the actual taco bell menu? You want to get fucking serious?
[19262.16s -> 19264.16s]  Taco time is a different restaurant
[19264.40s -> 19270.08s]  They keep grabbing adjacent taco themed restaurant and put it up on his taco bell menu like map
[19276.24s -> 19278.88s]  We're shilling for the wrong restaurant buddy
[19279.60s -> 19282.91s]  Did you kill them all? Yeah. Oh, there's one customer left
[19284.56s -> 19289.68s]  Don't kill them. I need to go underground to explore this map. What's the fiery sauce? What is that called?
[19290.32s -> 19296.00s]  Fire sauce. It's not on here. It just says fire sauce hot sauce technically fire

[19338.88s -> 19344.40s]  It might be a joint and that's gonna pump into the restaurant as like the meat or something. You found all teddy bears
[19345.20s -> 19349.60s]  Yay, what does that mean? I think i'm gonna jump in this makes fun music hole

[19387.93s -> 19390.65s]  I was a good well unified silence
[19393.72s -> 19398.28s]  The fuck do I open this saw you land the watermelon. I need the other watermelon to open it
[19399.58s -> 19402.30s]  I I love this taco bell map play through

[19429.45s -> 19431.45s]  You get in the car and you pick up a few people and you get you know
[19431.61s -> 19433.77s]  You want them to hear your music that you think is good?
[19434.73s -> 19436.97s]  And then you but you're you you know that they're not gonna like this
[19436.97s -> 19441.05s]  But like maybe if you put on the best one of the album they'll listen and go

[20333.43s -> 20335.59s]  I think this is a kill on touch situation
[20336.23s -> 20337.91s]  Why do you guys keep doing that?
[20337.91s -> 20341.67s]  Because it seems like it takes some money when you use it, which means it might give you something
[20342.47s -> 20344.47s]  Hang on. We got ants to kill. I'm trying one more time
[20345.75s -> 20350.63s]  It's possible that you could do this and then hit the mega bonus. It's possible. It gives you something really good

[20626.82s -> 20629.94s]  He's gonna be alive for about 10 more seconds until his charge runs out
[20631.46s -> 20635.28s]  Hurry up and get it back in here. Get those tacos
[20636.00s -> 20637.76s]  We did it
[20637.76s -> 20641.84s]  Yeah, I got a bomb you guys bad news. I haven't left yet still what?
[20645.75s -> 20647.75s]  Oh, this is bad. This is bad
[20661.76s -> 20668.26s]  It wasn't me this time I went brb last day wasn't me this time done five times
[20671.44s -> 20676.32s]  Hey, i'm i'm proud of you guys. We've never even made it past round two of the dice rolling
[20677.04s -> 20679.60s]  We made it all the way to go. We could have easily did it
[20680.00s -> 20683.92s]  We have a there's a technique of just jumping off and restarting at the beginning
[20684.48s -> 20687.70s]  Yeah, it's pretty you can see the end game of monopoly
[20688.64s -> 20692.45s]  Yeah, I mean and it's oh never mind the game bottom fragging
[20693.81s -> 20696.61s]  every time
[20696.61s -> 20697.49s]  It's too bad
[20697.57s -> 20703.65s]  I picked out a lot of there's a lot of other levels like a lot of clown levels and like creepy alien levels and
[20705.01s -> 20707.01s]  simpsons level
[20707.57s -> 20709.09s]  Just never get to the
[20709.09s -> 20712.77s]  Turkey survival actually had fully modeled turkeys clown
[20714.05s -> 20715.57s]  They were the zombies
[20715.57s -> 20716.69s]  That's why I picked it
[20716.69s -> 20722.13s]  There was one from there was a legacy one from last stream where it didn't have any real purpose behind it
[20722.13s -> 20726.69s]  But every zombie was for some reason pseudo voodoo the pokemon
[20726.85s -> 20732.69s]  I don't know why it wasn't in there was no description. Why it was just every zombie was pseudo voodoo. It just was
[20733.17s -> 20735.17s]  They were just pseudo voodoo
[20735.81s -> 20738.05s]  Which was pretty cool
[20738.21s -> 20741.33s]  So you guys you guys good to go you want to what's the I mean?
[20741.33s -> 20744.29s]  I don't know if I can host because james can't join me
[20745.25s -> 20750.53s]  But um, we have to see what the cranky boy wants to do since he's got his fucking gordita crunches
[20750.53s -> 20751.17s]  I mean, that's right
[20751.17s -> 20751.33s]  Yeah
[20751.33s -> 20755.17s]  It's like more of a situation of how much longer you guys want to go because there are plenty of maps the maps will
[20755.17s -> 20760.93s]  Go forever. So it's like whenever people pull the plug is when we wrap up because we're not going to run out of stuff to do
[20761.17s -> 20762.77s]  It's just more of like
[20762.77s -> 20764.37s]  You know
[20764.37s -> 20766.37s]  No, okay. It can only take so much
[20768.45s -> 20771.09s]  And then we don't come back to this for about a year ish
[20773.96s -> 20778.20s]  Are you gonna keep the maps downloaded? Yeah, it's all it's all it's all in one ever expanding
[20778.44s -> 20781.08s]  Map pack that I won't prune from the ones that we did
[20781.16s -> 20785.40s]  So anyone is interested in doing part three in like nine months
[20785.88s -> 20789.32s]  Uh, they can enjoy a 400 gigabyte download
[20789.96s -> 20791.96s]  I couldn't believe that seriously like when
[20792.68s -> 20797.56s]  He's like, oh, yeah kraken said it's a really big file. I'm like, yeah, whatever of course 10 gigs 20 gigs
[20798.60s -> 20802.12s]  Yeah, it took like it was huge. It was like my whole entire ssd
[20803.16s -> 20806.92s]  Yeah, it's it's a little gargantuan. I might i'll probably pretty big too
[20807.48s -> 20813.32s]  Yeah, the actual base game is like 60 or 70, isn't it? I think it's 90. It's like 89. Well, yeah
[20813.32s -> 20816.28s]  Well, that's part of it. I think this was around I think this was
[20817.16s -> 20819.16s]  I had to redownload the entire
[20819.24s -> 20824.52s]  Mod pack on stream like mine didn't download when we started so I was just quietly redownloading the whole mod pack
[20824.84s -> 20831.24s]  It was 150 gigabytes. So god, it's a little bit over double the game scale than at that point
[20831.40s -> 20833.40s]  So we're up at 250 ish
[20834.68s -> 20840.52s]  That's insane that I can right I mean I went through I got more or less everything that wasn't like completely garbage tier
[20840.60s -> 20842.60s]  Like obviously not worth playing
[20843.16s -> 20848.68s]  In this already so like honestly all that would be added for another session would be like new stuff and
[20849.08s -> 20853.48s]  I don't know how much new stuff that's good. Was the one on the the featured was the the
[20854.20s -> 20858.04s]  The fucking game of thrones one. Is that the one that's it looks like the same one that's featured
[20858.04s -> 20861.64s]  This one was new game of thrones is the one that's featured. Yeah, that one was brand new
[20862.36s -> 20864.36s]  Came out came out on the 14th. Yeah
[20864.52s -> 20865.80s]  Yeah
[20865.80s -> 20866.92s]  Like they're still updated
[20867.00s -> 20871.56s]  There's still new mods being made for this and some of them are honestly like you if you look like
[20872.76s -> 20879.00s]  There's actually good maps like there are good zombies maps on this obviously we didn't touch any of the actual good ones
[20879.08s -> 20883.40s]  But I made it is black ops 4 or not doesn't have it. Why black ops 3?
[20884.20s -> 20887.00s]  Well, I don't know why it's black ops 3. That's like the most
[20888.52s -> 20893.00s]  Don't all of them all of them have it but like they have to win. It's just that they don't have moddable
[20893.24s -> 20896.68s]  They did yeah, they didn't have the mod tools out right? Yeah, they don't have workshop
[20897.40s -> 20900.20s]  Like integration and that's what's made this so, you know
[20900.60s -> 20901.72s]  Okay
[20901.72s -> 20903.96s]  Did we win? No, we lost. No, we didn't win
[20904.84s -> 20906.04s]  oh
[20906.04s -> 20911.48s]  You were you were invincible for like 15 seconds held out for one more round after you left and then it went to shit
[20912.12s -> 20919.48s]  Remember pokemon sun and moon now. I remember that one. No, it was bad. Yeah. I remember that one now
[20925.54s -> 20929.62s]  Well, i'll give you i'll give you my uh, i'm down if you guys want to do any more
[20929.78s -> 20931.54s]  I'll be around for a little while
[20931.54s -> 20934.90s]  If uh, if we want to I got like we could play like a wind down one
[20934.90s -> 20942.02s]  That's like probably decent that I saw that actually intrigued me or we can play more trash garbage like cheese cube recheese
[20943.22s -> 20947.54s]  We've got options on both fronts. I will do anything. Whatever you guys i'm good for another one
[20950.84s -> 20952.84s]  Your mic is really low quiet
[20953.49s -> 20956.69s]  I'm fine to stick around for a little bit longer. It's not like I have anything. Okay cheese
[20957.57s -> 20959.57s]  I didn't want to see more. Uh
[20960.69s -> 20963.35s]  What do we feel on I I could be either the meme one or
[20964.07s -> 20969.43s]  The real one. I got a gordita crunch here with my name on it, but i'm also you know, happy to wait
[20971.65s -> 20973.65s]  I don't mind. It's up to you guys
[20974.74s -> 20979.70s]  There's a lot here. Let's do two more then. Yeah, okay. Uh, let's do
[20980.66s -> 20985.62s]  This one looks like it would be pretty good like actually like a decent map actually good
[20986.98s -> 20989.36s]  Sure
[20989.36s -> 20993.04s]  It's like a western themed cowboy one. That's an actual map. So
[20993.68s -> 20995.68s]  Wanted yeah
[20996.55s -> 20999.19s]  So is cheese cube just like a piece of absolute shit
[21000.47s -> 21004.71s]  He's assuming I think a lot of cheese cube is inevitably going to be garbage trash like
[21005.51s -> 21011.51s]  Go to solo and uh, look at the picture hover a picture under the maps. You can see it on cheese cube
[21011.59s -> 21013.59s]  There's a lot of cheese themed maps
[21013.83s -> 21019.59s]  All of them are completely garbage and I don't know why a bunch of different people make these maps cheese cube
[21019.59s -> 21022.31s]  Because like never the same person is what somebody just said
[21022.95s -> 21024.95s]  They don't go out here
[21025.11s -> 21029.27s]  That's like the whole mentality of the meme is that you see someone makes a cheese cube map and you say well
[21029.27s -> 21032.07s]  It must be good and then you make a cheese cube map. That's also fucking
[21032.71s -> 21037.59s]  Trash garbage and then you know the cycle continues. Uh, I don't oh there it is wanted. Okay
[21039.20s -> 21044.56s]  Now i'm only talking about like pictures that I saw wanted looked pretty good. Somebody said the cheese maps are challenge maps
[21045.20s -> 21047.89s]  I do like cheese
[21048.21s -> 21052.13s]  Cheese in the name they're for high level, uh zombies players only
[21053.09s -> 21057.49s]  That's us. Well, I'd say that's us. We almost beat monopoly. We almost need monopoly. That's pretty
[21058.53s -> 21065.12s]  I'd like I mean, I don't want to toot my own horn, but you know, I will I had about like a go ahead
[21066.16s -> 21069.20s]  No, I don't like to do that. Yeah, I had like a 40 headshot ratio
[21070.72s -> 21076.26s]  I didn't get I get I didn't give her many kills craig and the lobby is not joinable. Can you invite me again?
[21078.74s -> 21082.98s]  Hey, can you not do that to me? Sorry, I invite you
[21083.30s -> 21086.18s]  I know you're excited to eat that cheesy gordita crunch. Yeah
[21087.22s -> 21090.10s]  You probably oh, it's still not joinable
[21090.98s -> 21092.98s]  They're in here. I'm in here
[21095.64s -> 21100.74s]  My friend's game gotta tell you I hear that I can smell it I hear
[21101.70s -> 21107.14s]  I can smell the cheese in this cheesy gordita crunch a mile away as i'm as i'm picking it up
[21108.72s -> 21112.56s]  It's got a pungent odor for sure. Yeah, i'm not gonna do a taco camp guys
[21113.12s -> 21116.64s]  I I look i'm like the scum of the earth right now. I'm like
[21117.76s -> 21119.76s]  I'm like hiding in a twitch hoodie
[21120.40s -> 21122.24s]  I i'm
[21122.24s -> 21126.80s]  I'm unkempt and i'm eating a cheesy gordita crunch. This is I don't want you to know me this way
[21127.20s -> 21129.36s]  I'm gonna restart my game because it's not letting me in
[21132.53s -> 21134.13s]  Fucking sure
[21134.13s -> 21136.85s]  I invite everyone to my party. They're texting each other at my party

[21546.72s -> 21551.28s]  Teaspoon of sugar and then stir it up and drink it. Don't don't don't drink so bad. That'd be tea
[21552.40s -> 21554.40s]  Are you saying like this is that PSA?
[21556.40s -> 21559.92s]  Yeah, that's the you're on the right one if everyone can join james looks like he's
[21560.72s -> 21566.80s]  I'm gonna have to force crash steam, but i'm you know, i'll be there in a second. I'm being like fucking crazy
[21568.48s -> 21570.48s]  Hey, thanks for the 10 community subs pin
[21572.44s -> 21575.96s]  Man 10 community subs. Thank you. I don't think i've ever tried rc cola
[21576.44s -> 21577.80s]  How do you guys feel about rc cola?
[21577.80s -> 21580.28s]  I've never heard of it because I live out in the middle of fucking nowhere
[21580.52s -> 21584.92s]  Is that water with a lemon in it? I think that's more reason that you should probably have heard of
[21586.60s -> 21589.40s]  With the lemon in it you didn't squeeze the lemon into it. It's not my thing
[21589.40s -> 21591.96s]  So i'm not gonna say i'm not gonna answer that it's not like
[21592.76s -> 21594.20s]  for me
[21594.20s -> 21599.40s]  Is this like uh like off-brand cola, but I don't like cola
[21599.80s -> 21604.12s]  But how do you get more bootleg than cola feel like the mass produce it enough that you know, that's cheaper
[21604.68s -> 21608.68s]  Rc cola isn't it like a full dollar per can cheaper or something? Yeah, it's cheaper
[21608.68s -> 21611.16s]  But I don't understand why like how do they make it cheaper?
[21612.61s -> 21615.09s]  Because when you buy a mac you think like the mac tastes better
[21616.40s -> 21618.08s]  That's the reason
[21618.08s -> 21621.28s]  It's like a oh a computer. Yeah, it's like this. It's a reason
[21621.28s -> 21623.28s]  It's a reason why why are you eating your max dude?
[21623.28s -> 21627.04s]  Where's my max like fucking 30 more expensive now i'm thinking about mac and cheese, man

[21976.32s -> 21982.60s]  I mean this game uses a lot. I stuttered there for a second
[21983.32s -> 21986.60s]  I think it's the particle effects of the why are you on fire again?
[21987.32s -> 21989.32s]  I just wanted to see if I could jump it
[21989.57s -> 21992.69s]  Wait, where what are we talking this lava here? You can't jump it

[22317.64s -> 22319.80s]  I don't think there's a way they modded this at this point
[22319.88s -> 22323.64s]  This must have been like from a different call of duty and they like ported it in like the bats and stuff
[22324.28s -> 22330.20s]  What other call of duty has fucking bats like the I mean, I don't know. There's a western themed, uh zombies map in one of them

[22357.06s -> 22359.06s]  What is going on with this?
[22359.30s -> 22361.54s]  Wait, this is just a regular black ops 3 map. No way
[22362.10s -> 22366.42s]  No way. We just played an actual map. That was wait. This is not a modern map
[22367.30s -> 22371.30s]  This is not no, this is a mod. This is a mod. I was gonna say this is pretty well done. Okay
[22372.18s -> 22377.46s]  Black ops 3 has a call of Cthulhu type map and has bad enemies. Okay, so yeah, I mean, okay

[23374.90s -> 23376.90s]  I don't have options like
[23376.98s -> 23379.70s]  No, it used to be like that i'm going to go upstairs. I'm going to open my fridge
[23379.78s -> 23384.34s]  I'm gonna go turkey sounds good. I'm gonna pull out like a slice of turkey right put it in my mouth
[23384.66s -> 23387.14s]  And that's my fucking day. All right, because I can't just
[23387.86s -> 23389.38s]  I know because here's the situation
[23389.38s -> 23395.06s]  Okay, I can't like they had postmates here where I lived for like a day and then the driver was like fuck that shit
[23395.06s -> 23399.17s]  And he 180 degree right out of town. He left and since then
[23400.07s -> 23405.91s]  I'm out here in the sticks alone. I used to eat a dry ass one slice one slice dry
[23408.23s -> 23410.31s]  Dry ass no mayo nothing
[23410.31s -> 23413.27s]  It was just a dry sandwich with a piece of bologna and a piece of cheese
[23414.37s -> 23415.41s]  And I was like this sucks
[23415.41s -> 23419.57s]  When you're deprived options you get like it to honestly like there's no at a certain point
[23419.57s -> 23423.12s]  There's no creativity in my meal. Like I just like there's no options
[23423.12s -> 23426.48s]  So I might as well just eat the most the most absolute basic shit, you know
[23426.64s -> 23428.48s]  That's what it's that's what it comes down to now
[23428.56s -> 23431.28s]  And it always you open up the pantry or whatever and you just see it
[23431.28s -> 23435.84s]  It's something so basic that you can't you can't even stand it. It's like corn flakes or something
[23436.48s -> 23439.84s]  It's just like god did why did why didn't I buy like the s'mores cereal?
[23440.00s -> 23442.00s]  Um for this very reason
[23443.60s -> 23448.16s]  I mean my situation is that like I only go shopping like once like a week and I end up blowing all the nice stuff
[23448.16s -> 23451.36s]  I would have eaten over the course of the first two days and the rest of the fucking week is like
[23451.76s -> 23453.60s]  a ramen
[23453.60s -> 23457.52s]  Fucking bagel like for like the next five days. Yeah shaking my head the whole time dude
[23457.60s -> 23459.60s]  I do the same thing with like drinks
[23460.24s -> 23462.80s]  I go get like a carton of orange juice if it's gone in two days
[23464.63s -> 23467.91s]  Yeah, uh, this will last me a week and I drink the whole thing in a day
[23468.79s -> 23473.44s]  Yep, and like yeah, I know that i'm sitting there because I can't I can't order new stuff
[23473.52s -> 23478.72s]  And it's too inconvenient to take the trip back. I'm glad someone finally understands me man. That's that's really what i'm telling you
[23478.80s -> 23480.80s]  It feels like all these people from the city, man. They don't
[23481.28s -> 23483.28s]  Wait, you guys he just said he was from vegas
[23486.64s -> 23488.64s]  He's lying to you
[23492.96s -> 23495.72s]  I just was trying to use empathy
[23495.72s -> 23497.72s]  A friend
[23498.04s -> 23500.69s]  I trusted you
[23500.69s -> 23502.69s]  I'm taking my bagels elsewhere
[23504.18s -> 23510.66s]  Yeah in vegas I could I could go walk down the street and find like a five-star steak right now. What is it 2 a.m?
[23515.03s -> 23520.63s]  All right, I after that I gotta go I gotta eat something I gotta find like some slop to put in my mouth
[23522.47s -> 23528.47s]  Well, it's been fun guys. Thank you for humoring us in our uh, yeah, uh, it's pretty fun. No, it's cool
[23529.03s -> 23531.94s]  sure
[23531.94s -> 23534.34s]  Follow all the channels. Yeah, we're still here
[23535.57s -> 23537.57s]  They're all swell. I'm still here
[23537.89s -> 23539.89s]  Oh, i'm not muted. Sorry. I thought I muted oops
[23543.09s -> 23546.13s]  I was telling it by you like bug you guys are all fucking cool. You know
[23547.01s -> 23549.01s]  I heard him say don't follow all their channels
[23549.57s -> 23551.57s]  What and then?
[23551.81s -> 23556.53s]  I didn't say that did I I think he just said that I definitely heard that. Uh, well
[23557.49s -> 23559.49s]  That killed the mood for me. Yeah, like
[23560.53s -> 23562.53s]  I didn't say that did I did not
[23563.81s -> 23569.49s]  Yeah, that's like it's in this one thing off. Yeah, we're turning it off. All right, i'm not gonna support this behavior
[23572.80s -> 23574.80s]  No, not the squad anything about the squad
[23575.92s -> 23578.16s]  At least the squad keep the squad together
[23580.10s -> 23582.10s]  All right, see you guys have a good night for real
[23585.52s -> 23587.60s]  Did I actually said no I did I didn't say don't
[23588.32s -> 23594.39s]  Does somebody have a clip?
[23594.39s -> 23596.88s]  Squads gone
[23596.88s -> 23602.24s]  No, honestly fall that was uber hexa nova. That was kraken and tomato
[23604.80s -> 23605.76s]  Please
[23605.76s -> 23608.56s]  Give them a follow. They're all hilarious. They're all great. Great dudes
[23615.73s -> 23617.73s]  squad morale broken
[23618.53s -> 23620.53s]  Uh, so i'll see you tomorrow
[23620.53s -> 23622.53s]  We are going to probably play
[23623.33s -> 23625.09s]  Kalahoir as tomorrow
[23625.09s -> 23630.13s]  Unless something else comes up, maybe I don't know anything could happen
[23630.85s -> 23638.10s]  Uh, thank you so much for the thousands of dollars. It's not even a joke
[23638.66s -> 23644.53s]  We're gonna go through the bits. We went through a lot of them in the beginning of the stream already
[23645.09s -> 23647.65s]  Because there was an actual shit load of them. So
[23649.70s -> 23651.72s]  If you're taking off, i'll see you tomorrow
[23651.72s -> 23657.32s]  Not gonna start at 6 pm 6 30 tomorrow. It's gonna start at the normal time between like three and four
[23660.96s -> 23665.44s]  We'll ever stream with nova. Yeah, I mean anytime that these guys want to play of course
[23668.34s -> 23670.34s]  You know, it's just whenever it happens it happens, right?
[23675.04s -> 23679.04s]  But uh, let's get the it is getting late. So I want to kind of
[23679.76s -> 23685.09s]  It's very late. It's almost four o'clock in the morning eastern. So
[23685.73s -> 23690.60s]  i'm gonna turn this off because
[23695.49s -> 23698.37s]  And let's go back about uh, six and a half hours ago
[23699.09s -> 23703.89s]  So i'll be starting to like three or four
[23704.53s -> 23709.12s]  normal time tomorrow
[23709.12s -> 23711.88s]  Not like it was today
[23711.88s -> 23713.08s]  but
[23713.08s -> 23715.32s]  We had the the insane
[23717.34s -> 23718.48s]  1700
[23718.48s -> 23720.48s]  almost 1800 dollars from
[23721.11s -> 23723.11s]  somebody named jeremiah's massive dong
[23725.86s -> 23729.38s]  And I yeah, it was fucking out of control. It was a lot of money
[23731.57s -> 23735.00s]  I
[23735.00s -> 23738.87s]  Not much else to say on that
[23738.87s -> 23741.67s]  That's how we started it out freudian weapon gave 250
[23744.93s -> 23747.49s]  Regardless of the start time. These streams are always a hoot
[23749.08s -> 23751.08s]  Jerma Hartway appreciate you
[23752.66s -> 23755.28s]  I appreciate you too
[23755.28s -> 23759.76s]  Yeah, I wouldn't have started this late unless there was a reason to push it forward by that much which obviously
[23760.72s -> 23763.52s]  Pretty good reason
[23763.52s -> 23764.80s]  It's always fun
[23764.80s -> 23770.69s]  I might i'm sorry. I wasn't really that great at black ops zombies tonight was the only experience i've ever had
[23772.23s -> 23774.80s]  i've never played it
[23774.80s -> 23778.80s]  And I don't play call of duty either. So it was still fun
[23781.94s -> 23784.08s]  Oh then we had
[23784.08s -> 23786.56s]  after the like two grand of insanity
[23787.20s -> 23794.37s]  Dork cube gave 250 i'm hiding my bits next to mr. Moneybags donations

[23806.02s -> 23808.02s]  I don't even know what any of these guns do
[23809.65s -> 23812.05s]  I don't even know what I don't know what the power-ups are
[23814.85s -> 23819.33s]  I have no I don't know. How do you uh, literally none of these systems i've never seen

[23847.43s -> 23851.11s]  Last time I opened a call of duty game was I think modern warfare 3
[23853.25s -> 23855.97s]  Well black ops 2 maybe like 10 years ago
[23861.16s -> 23864.37s]  I don't know
[23864.37s -> 23868.05s]  And nothing has changed. Yeah, but i've been playing zombies. It's like a completely different game mode
[23875.46s -> 23877.46s]  Uh, but drosophilia. Thanks with five dollars
[23878.02s -> 23888.58s]  They say hi. Hi

[23919.28s -> 23921.52s]  Love you jerma happy to see some more custom zombies
[23924.55s -> 23926.23s]  Yeah, it was still interesting
[23926.23s -> 23934.07s]  But my favorite level was probably the if no, what was my favorite level?
[23934.63s -> 23944.40s]  Probably the game of thrones one. That was just cool. It's fun and funny
[23944.88s -> 23951.25s]  But thank you tried and jacks. It was a good first ever experience
[23952.58s -> 23955.70s]  Uh nicknamed jack. Thanks for the 250 we require ads
[23956.34s -> 23969.76s]  Yeah, but I don't have to give them to you. You know, I don't want to give you ads but thank you for the 250

[23986.47s -> 23989.99s]  Nebula brand five community subs turtle toenail ten dollars
[23990.63s -> 23996.39s]  This is no longer a cod stream. This is now a bit stream. Yeah

[24003.89s -> 24009.06s]  And it's wildly appreciated
[24009.06s -> 24012.39s]  Thanks for the ten bucks
[24012.47s -> 24013.59s]  uh
[24013.59s -> 24015.59s]  Zalnag thanks for the five dollars

[24051.86s -> 24054.82s]  I can't even believe i'm having this conversation that that much money is coming through
[24063.44s -> 24065.44s]  It's fucking remarkable to me
[24067.64s -> 24073.25s]  Thank you
[24073.25s -> 24075.25s]  Uh flimflam ten dollars from flimflam
[24076.08s -> 24079.04s]  Surely such a massive streamer getting such a massive amount of money
[24080.00s -> 24084.40s]  Mainly from one massive dong warrants a massive stream announcement for the near future
[24085.04s -> 24089.70s]  Well, I already talked about this is this already this whole this stream paid for the dunk tank stream
[24091.00s -> 24093.40s]  That might cost a few thousand dollars at least
[24094.28s -> 24096.28s]  So there it is
[24100.95s -> 24102.95s]  Depending on how what needs to happen
[24103.43s -> 24110.15s]  I sure I probably should hear back from

[24294.15s -> 24296.15s]  I don't really have time to play this now
[24296.95s -> 24298.95s]  This is a full episode of television

[24302.74s -> 24304.98s]  I might open with this tomorrow
[24307.01s -> 24309.01s]  Because it's very very late
[24309.41s -> 24311.81s]  It's like 4 a.m. Eastern. I'd rather
[24312.53s -> 24314.05s]  do this when
[24314.05s -> 24318.69s]  It's not so so late. This is fucking list. I'm like just i'm not gonna scroll that far
[24318.69s -> 24320.69s]  But this looks like it's very well made
[24321.88s -> 24327.76s]  Make sure to remind me to do this tomorrow because this is like a full episode of television
[24328.71s -> 24330.87s]  It's a full movie. They weren't kidding around

[24348.61s -> 24352.00s]  So remind me on friday that we're gonna watch this
[24352.64s -> 24354.64s]  It seems like something good just to do right

[24364.34s -> 24366.10s]  Unless something else comes up
[24366.10s -> 24369.03s]  But i'm, not sure we'll see
