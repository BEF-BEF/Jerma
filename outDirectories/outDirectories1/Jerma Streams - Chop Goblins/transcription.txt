[6.26s -> 18.09s]  That was really bad. Do it louder. No! All right, so what uh, what do we want to do?
[18.09s -> 30.95s]  I got a few options here. Let's see. I could do... I could play Isaac. Oh, what about um...
[32.87s -> 37.94s]  What about Chop Goblins? This has been on the list for a long time. This is, I think this is pretty
[37.94s -> 51.75s]  short. Isn't this only like an hour or two? This is like less than an hour, isn't it? Yeah, let's do
[51.75s -> 76.15s]  that. That sounds fun. Yeah, I'm gonna give it a try. Give me one sec. You should see it momentarily.
[76.15s -> 96.74s]  Keep the title. Keep the title. Yeah, I think, let me see. I love how this is a Chop Goblins
[96.74s -> 113.16s]  game of the week edition. Cool. All right, now I'm gonna get it. Yeah, it's a little uh, it's an FPS
[114.02s -> 121.99s]  made by... what's the dusk dev there? What's his name? Uh, the stream is probably gonna lag
[121.99s -> 136.87s]  for a minute because I'm downloading a game. So I might f for a minute or so here. All right,
[136.87s -> 152.81s]  here we go. Let's give it a shot. That was quick. All right, I already love it. I already love this
[152.81s -> 182.81s]  game. I do need to change my capturing though. Will it capture it? Hey, there it is. I already
[182.81s -> 197.82s]  love it. All right, look sensitivity is going down. Let's try that. Kids mode. What is kids mode? Oh,
[197.82s -> 218.79s]  listen to this. Wow. Whoa. The music is... Oh, oops, I didn't mean to do that. All right, let's do it.
[220.10s -> 228.98s]  Okay, select difficulty. What levels with no enemies or UI? You're new to PC shooters or just
[228.98s -> 237.93s]  want a chill experience. Kind of chill. This is a chill stream. The intended balance for a first
[237.93s -> 249.62s]  playthrough or goblin mode. Uh, I'll do this one. The year is 1984. On a whim one evening you decide
[249.62s -> 255.10s]  to break into the local museum's basement and see what sort of treasures it might hold. One dusty
[255.10s -> 261.11s]  wooden chest catches your eye. You open it and a mob of strange creatures leaps out. This particular
[261.11s -> 266.81s]  chest was secretly a prison for the malevolent chop goblins lured inside by the promise of
[266.81s -> 272.09s]  delicious cheese and trapped for untold eons. They're now loose to wreak havoc on the world
[272.09s -> 277.61s]  once more. You know what must be done. Grabbing an antique dagger from a pile of dusty artifacts
[277.61s -> 283.93s]  you give chase. Antique dagger you grab from a nearby crate. Not the best weapon. It's better
[283.93s -> 291.46s]  than nothing. And a skilled welder might be able to deflect thrown projectiles with it. You can also
[291.46s -> 295.14s]  do a quick dagger attack at any time regardless of what weapon you have out by pressing the use
[295.14s -> 325.00s]  button. Whoa. I gotta turn sensitivity down. Uh, okay let's try it. Uh, it's gotta go even lower.
[325.56s -> 350.22s]  It's too low. I'm sorry it's too low. I'm gonna say 40. All right that's this is close enough.
[350.86s -> 359.30s]  I can't get it to where I want it. That's fine. All right Goldilocks. Sensitivity is probably the
[359.30s -> 368.68s]  most important thing in PC gaming. I don't care if you have a GTX 3090 or an RTX 4080.
[369.56s -> 376.36s]  Six monitors and like a fucking i-10 like 55 million. If your sensitivity is wrong you're
[376.36s -> 398.30s]  gonna do dog shit in games. Ass too. It's very fast. I gotta turn it down just a little bit though.
[398.30s -> 418.12s]  Okay so chop coin. Oh shit. Is there how do I parry? Wasn't there like there was like a
[418.12s -> 436.50s]  parry button right? Am I making that up? Get some ammo. Scared the shit out of me.
[437.43s -> 448.90s]  Tremor what are you playing? This is chop goblins. Oh speed runs this game up probably crazy.
[449.78s -> 455.67s]  Okay fire can I take that was really stupid. That was a really dumb thing to do.
[459.62s -> 487.08s]  Anymore? Do I have a map or anything? There's a gun right there. All right you know if you know
[487.08s -> 490.84s]  if the dusk dev is working on this and there's a there's a weapon like this in the game it's
[490.84s -> 506.62s]  gonna be clean. I'm just saying. Yep. How do I take out the other weapon? Wait I want to I
[506.62s -> 516.23s]  didn't check the other thing down here. There's another door. Where was it? Oh no just wrapped
[516.23s -> 528.76s]  around. Zoro? Oh my god the tannins. I forgot about my tea. Why did nobody remind me? I gotta
[528.76s -> 539.46s]  take these bags out. One the other one's like all the way at the bottom. Hold on I think I can get it.
[541.18s -> 551.03s]  Burn the shit out of my hand. I just reached into the tea. I just burnt my finger. All right
[551.03s -> 565.51s]  I'll live. Oh boy. Yeah this thing's full of tannins. All right get them next time. Test.
[566.07s -> 598.62s]  No we're good. Did I get a soda? There's no jump interestingly enough. Hey good thing I was playing
[598.62s -> 604.06s]  Resident Evil right before this because I feel like I'm doing very well. All right where's um
[605.10s -> 609.38s]  oh it's E when you have a different weapon. I don't think I can switch between the two.
[609.94s -> 623.78s]  Very good. Oh right click does it too. Right click is way better than E.
[624.58s -> 648.94s]  I think I can reflect those. What do the chop coins do? Oh that's a good question.
[665.64s -> 685.99s]  Oh can I get one of these? I get plenty of ammo which is good. Okay I think I got everything.
[685.99s -> 701.34s]  Let's go out. Are you naked right now? Um no I'm actually kind of pretty sweaty right now. Does
[701.34s -> 709.50s]  anybody know if any of those you know those desk air conditioners. Are those things real? I kind
[709.50s -> 725.58s]  of like need one. All right I need a key. They suck. I figured it was kind of meh. Why would I
[725.58s -> 736.20s]  do that? I tried to pick it up with E and I stabbed it. Fan. They're not fans they're these weird
[736.84s -> 763.30s]  chilling machines. They have to vent outside of a window. Hmm don't hit that. Oh my goodness
[763.30s -> 787.24s]  there's a lot in here. I should have just lowered them all down. Whoa big coin. This is a really
[787.24s -> 797.35s]  British stream. Oh wait I didn't get all the things. The Chop Goblins have escaped the museum
[797.35s -> 803.50s]  and are running amok on the streets of your city. Sounds of wanton destruction greet you as you
[803.50s -> 809.46s]  exit the front doors. You catch a glimpse of several Chop Goblins disappearing into an alley.
[809.46s -> 813.22s]  With shock you realize they are carrying the crown jewel of the museum's collection.
[813.22s -> 820.52s]  The ancient Aztec time manipulation tablet. With that precious artifact they could wreak havoc not
[820.52s -> 828.39s]  just on your city not just on the world but on time itself. You know what you must do. The Chop
[828.39s -> 836.95s]  Goblins. The Chop Goblin does are sort of like Smurfette except huge angry steeped in 1950s
[836.95s -> 842.98s]  stereotypes and there's way more than one of them. Goblin does don't need cleavers to do damage.
[842.98s -> 850.10s]  They attack with cutting words alone. Keep some cover handy. Blinch them if they start winding up
[850.10s -> 863.83s]  and whatever you do don't insult their hairstyle. Oh my goodness. Oh no they chopped down the
[863.83s -> 890.17s]  building. They're chopping down the buildings. We gotta go stop them. Wear one of these. It's a
[890.17s -> 894.41s]  baseball hat with a fan in the brim with a hole in it that's pointing down at your head.
[898.15s -> 904.44s]  That's actually like I kind of want to like try it. I kind of want one of those. Is that weird?
[905.24s -> 932.28s]  My goodness okay that hurts. Actual skill issue here. I'm almost dead. Okay I gotta heal. I'm
[932.28s -> 956.92s]  almost dead. Is this still the Resident Evil 4 remake? What am I doing? Oh new weapon. Yes.
[957.88s -> 997.10s]  Streets a shotgun. Oh shit. Okay all right not bad. Bathroom. You're gonna play stalker too
[997.10s -> 1003.14s]  when it comes out? Um I think the stalker games my brain is not big enough for them.
[1003.86s -> 1018.50s]  Whoa how do I get in there? Although I did play the those old stalker games. What was it on like
[1018.50s -> 1026.94s]  master difficulty or something? I played it on some difficulty that was really really oh no like
[1026.94s -> 1034.57s]  realism. It was like realistic mode or something. What was it called? It was a different mode.
[1035.66s -> 1038.46s]  People said no I'll play on that one because that's like the best one to play on.
[1040.06s -> 1054.09s]  Something like that. It was master. It is the recommended way to play even if you're not good.
[1054.65s -> 1076.86s]  I want all that. Yeah I just didn't really get into them. I tried playing what was it?
[1079.38s -> 1082.50s]  There was an extensive this is years ago. This is like four or five years ago now right?
[1083.06s -> 1089.94s]  There was an extensive argument and well debate is probably better to say than argument on what
[1089.94s -> 1094.82s]  game I actually should have been playing. Is this like two or three in the original series right?
[1094.82s -> 1117.42s]  Jesus oh my god well that was a little ridiculous. Go use the key. Did I get one? I didn't even pay
[1117.42s -> 1140.74s]  attention. You have the key. Oh well let's go do it. What about ultra kill? I'll play the new ultra
[1140.74s -> 1151.27s]  kill patch. I'd like to wait a little bit longer though. I'd rather wait till at least a couple more
[1151.27s -> 1172.01s]  chapters are there to play. How much is even left of the game? Is there one or two chapters left?
[1172.01s -> 1192.62s]  Maybe three chapters left? I want to get up there. Hmm how do I get up there? This game jams. Yeah
[1192.62s -> 1220.36s]  this is nice. There's no jump button. I like games that have little secrets like this. So there is a
[1220.36s -> 1240.73s]  combo meter up there. They've locked the fence. What? How do you bolt cutters? You missed a lot of
[1240.73s -> 1246.81s]  secrets. Oh man I love when games have secrets. Oh man I really love when a game has secrets.
[1246.81s -> 1257.61s]  Like I could go that way. I could go over there. I could look that way. How do I get up there? Is
[1257.61s -> 1274.66s]  there a jump button? I just don't know what it is. Found a wand charge. Is it alt space control? No.
[1275.30s -> 1299.69s]  Cool. Uh oh. There's a new enemy. I don't even know what they yell and if you're in line of sight
[1299.69s -> 1330.15s]  it hurts you. What are they saying? We want some cheese. Yeah that's what they're saying. They're
[1330.15s -> 1375.22s]  going where's the cheese? It's the lore. Oh start again. Come here. Here's some cheese. Yeah where's
[1375.22s -> 1413.83s]  the cheese? I like the chop goblin. Oh boy. Holy shit. What just happened? Oh bolt cutters. Let's
[1413.83s -> 1467.27s]  go. There's a gamer slo-mo. Nice. I think that's a gamer slo-mo. You can switch weapons. I mean I
[1467.27s -> 1484.04s]  I like the shotgun. All right I got the bolt cutters. Let's go. You're related to these
[1484.04s -> 1499.50s]  goblins. Hey yeah. Hey back off. Hey back off. How's that sound? What did that button do?
[1500.06s -> 1522.74s]  There was an extra button. What is it? What is it? What are those? Where was the fence?
[1522.74s -> 1540.54s]  Not back here. It was way back. Goblin. Calm down bro. Hey here's an idea and just like kind of
[1540.54s -> 1556.54s]  put this around your brain for a second. Back off. Jesus. Time portal. Let's go.
[1566.49s -> 1582.36s]  Why is he so pissed? Hey back off. A whirl of colors passes by and you emerge from the time
[1582.36s -> 1589.50s]  portal gasping for breath. After a moment you survey your surroundings and it doesn't take
[1589.50s -> 1595.38s]  long for you to comprehend the chop goblin's plans. You're in the castle of Count Dracula.
[1595.38s -> 1600.86s]  They must mean to wake him from his eternal slumber to aid them in their evil rampage.
[1600.86s -> 1608.78s]  A strange weapon lies in front of you seemingly fashioned to hurl wooden stakes left here by a
[1608.78s -> 1613.29s]  doomed vampire hunter no doubt. They'll probably come in handy for the battle that's about to take
[1613.85s -> 1621.46s]  place. The Nosperatus are Dracula's fearsome feline pets created through dark vampire magic.
[1621.46s -> 1625.50s]  Now they've joined forces with the chop goblins. Keep your distance and watch out for their lunge
[1625.50s -> 1671.45s]  attack. Oh hell yeah. MK Impaler. Clean. This, I like this zone. This sound is cool. There's one
[1671.45s -> 1715.35s]  more. Remember did you ever have a goth phase? No I did not. A goth phase. You should start now.
[1715.35s -> 1733.05s]  I don't think I want to start goth phase at 40. I don't know if I want to do that. Why not?
[1733.69s -> 1738.65s]  Because I don't think I can pull that shit off at 40. I can't pull that off right now.
[1745.34s -> 1771.46s]  Yes you can. I don't think I can pull it off. Not with that attitude. Can I get in there?
[1771.46s -> 1778.94s]  Goth is ageless. Being goth is ageless. Yeah I'm just telling you I don't think I could
[1778.94s -> 1804.31s]  pull it off right now. Goth is a lifestyle. Yeah one day should I just turn on the webcam
[1804.31s -> 1812.07s]  and just have just like straight straight black hair like do like put like powder all over my
[1812.07s -> 1819.03s]  face or something and have like dar like put like bags into my eyes wear like a cloak put
[1819.03s -> 1829.62s]  be like Count Dracula for a day. Okay hold on this is like a puzzle I need to figure this out.
[1834.97s -> 1851.03s]  Oh my goodness these things are kind of scary. Just do it on Halloween. Okay I might.
[1853.46s -> 1859.24s]  I might. I don't know. I can't. This is not a Roblox birthday party promise.
[1860.04s -> 1880.20s]  Wait what am I doing? I need to touch that. A door somewhere has opened. I kind of already have done
[1880.20s -> 1896.55s]  this in a way with the whole like oh like Lucius Malfoy. Didn't I? Kind of. That does not count.
[1898.12s -> 1909.85s]  I don't think Bugleberry. No Bugleberry is not goth. I don't I don't know about that. All right
[1909.85s -> 1926.15s]  what door opened? Bugleberry to me is like are you afraid of the dark Nickelodeon. That's like
[1926.15s -> 1945.91s]  whatever that is. Like campy horror. I don't know what you would call it. Does he tell you to say
[1945.91s -> 1957.90s]  that? No I'm just it's an observation. Yeah he's like a Goosebumps villain. Yeah yeah like are you
[1957.90s -> 1969.05s]  afraid of the dark Goosebumps. I have been told that that is the intent the intent of that uh that
[1969.05s -> 1972.89s]  is what I have been told. That that's what they were going with but he's been going for.
[1973.77s -> 2012.26s]  Who told you that? Hey hey back off. I wonder what he's up to. True yeah I wonder what he's doing.
[2012.82s -> 2032.65s]  That looks like something I should put up there. Wait this thing's take a lot of damage. What the
[2032.65s -> 2050.46s]  hell is that? No honestly what the hell is that? Bam. Dude come on man. I'm gonna show this but
[2050.54s -> 2060.68s]  like what the fuck are people doing? This is on Redbubble? Oh my god. Why? Hold on a second.
[2061.24s -> 2091.32s]  This is apparently like a like a throw blanket on Redbubble. Okay. No I uh uh I don't I don't
[2091.32s -> 2101.32s]  want to do it. I don't want to do it. I'm not doing it. This is a fucking picture where I got
[2101.32s -> 2107.24s]  like the sun in my face from like at like TwitchCon like 2017 or something. I don't even know when
[2107.24s -> 2133.30s]  this is. Oh my goodness. All right. Wait people actually own this thing? What? No. I okay I'm gonna
[2133.30s -> 2144.58s]  stop giving this attention. All right let's go let's keep playing this game if we have a plan.
[2147.82s -> 2161.82s]  Vampire. Oh my goodness gracious. Okay. It's better that you don't know. Bro. All right.
[2161.82s -> 2200.57s]  How many masks do I need? Am I going backwards? Yes I am. You know I one of the reasons why
[2200.73s -> 2208.87s]  Bugleberry is like I would say one of my uh he's like one of my favorite characters.
[2209.88s -> 2218.62s]  I love Bugleberry. I just love that old kind of Vincent Price horror kind of campy
[2219.42s -> 2231.10s]  jokey but not really a lot of inspiration from that sector there. Oh my god that scared me.
[2231.10s -> 2240.71s]  What do you mean character? I mean he's a character. He's a character right? You know
[2240.71s -> 2253.77s]  people describe people like that. He's a character. Um where is this thing with the masks? I haven't
[2253.77s -> 2267.74s]  been paying that much attention. All right where am I going from here? I'm kind of lost.
[2268.38s -> 2305.62s]  Was it down? I think I'm just walking in circles. Oh okay hold on. This is new. All right that's a
[2305.62s -> 2325.11s]  third mask. This is mobile game ad level of gameplay. What do you mean from me? I mean I
[2325.11s -> 2345.90s]  was reading chat and talking. Yeah here it is. We're good. I know where I am. We're right here.
[2345.90s -> 2376.65s]  Oh preparing me for something.
[2390.34s -> 2415.67s]  All right he's dead. What was he even saying? That was adorable. Again you emerge from the time
[2415.67s -> 2422.06s]  portal. Dracula's foul baritone echoing in your ears. Define yourself in ancient Greece.
[2422.06s -> 2427.67s]  Dracula's defeat was a heavy blow to the chop goblins and you guessed that they now seek the
[2427.67s -> 2436.36s]  staff of the Corinthians. A powerful magic weapon from the anals of myth and legend. Did I say that
[2436.36s -> 2453.98s]  wrong? I think I did. Whatever. They cannot be allowed to wield such a weapon. You must first,
[2453.98s -> 2463.50s]  you must find it first. The mods are uh having a grand old time over here with various images
[2463.50s -> 2473.18s]  and where they are put. Various blankets and um and wardrobe and uh having a having a grand old
[2473.18s -> 2479.40s]  time. All right they can't be allowed. You must find it first and use it against them. The big
[2479.40s -> 2484.22s]  choppers are the ultimate chop goblin warriors. You weapons slow them down and they can destroy
[2484.22s -> 2503.70s]  your health in seconds. Be careful. Any new weapons? Oh I like this area. It's anals. Anals. I know.
[2511.16s -> 2514.60s]  I figured that out the tenth of a second after the words came out of my mouth.
[2515.24s -> 2546.07s]  Pistol for a little bit. A little slow. I can't believe they made this in row. Oh that's still the
[2546.07s -> 2562.81s]  title. Ah I love this. I want one of these. You know what I mean? I'm never I'm never gonna have
[2562.81s -> 2571.14s]  one of these but if I if you told me to just okay dream dream house. I just want like a nice clear
[2571.14s -> 2576.66s]  cool just little pool not a big one. Everybody I don't like big pools. I just want a little place
[2576.66s -> 2582.34s]  for me to go sink and just like soak down to my chest and just like ah just for a little bit.
[2583.48s -> 2592.76s]  A shallow little pool like a little no like like a yeah like a hot tub. A hot tub that's not just
[2592.76s -> 2599.34s]  hot water. I just want to sit in a little just like this and I want it to be like a plant right
[2599.34s -> 2604.74s]  here. I want it to be like oxygen producing from like cactuses plants and shit all over here. You
[2604.74s -> 2614.62s]  know what I'm saying? I want this exact lighting too. You want a bathtub. This is way bigger than
[2614.62s -> 2623.96s]  a bathtub. Let's use the chop goblin as sort of a scale here. This is big enough for like five
[2623.96s -> 2628.92s]  people to sit in. I and I want it for me. I don't want anybody else sitting in this. This is for me
[2628.92s -> 2637.53s]  not for anybody else. This is not a case where like oh yeah come over here come over here and piss in
[2637.53s -> 2652.54s]  my pool. No no no no this is for me to sit in here and decompress. Holly could use it too. Yeah no
[2652.54s -> 2660.82s]  yeah that's no no I'm just talking no outside other outside people could use it. I wouldn't
[2660.82s -> 2665.70s]  even tell anybody I had it because you know the first second somebody would be oh my god
[2666.34s -> 2671.85s]  the second that somebody finds out you have one of those oh sick oh cool yeah and they
[2671.85s -> 2679.13s]  stood there taking their shirt off. He's like no we're not uh yeah we could but uh oh dude really
[2679.13s -> 2686.20s]  you got a little a little pool like that let's go I'm getting in. No no no no no don't go in that.
[2686.20s -> 2697.77s]  I don't know probably a weirdo if you want. It's all right man just dump a bunch of shock in it.
[2700.49s -> 2707.85s]  I'm sorry I puked in your nice pristine pool. No just don't shock in here it'll be fine. No what?
[2707.85s -> 2712.57s]  No I want a clean pool. I don't want to even fucking puke in my pool. I don't want to piss in my pool.
[2716.94s -> 2722.46s]  Sorry man I accidentally I peed and shit in your pool but it's all right just that white powder
[2722.46s -> 2727.58s]  that you sprinkle in that like with chemicals just dump it in there and it'll get rid of the puke.
[2730.06s -> 2731.74s]  Oh dude you're never coming over again.
[2740.18s -> 2747.11s]  Dude you got weird friends. Why are people doing this in your pool?
[2749.37s -> 2758.06s]  Nobody ever says that. Nobody ever says they're doing that but they do and you know what?
[2758.78s -> 2770.49s]  Shame on you. Shame on you. I wonder I wonder I wonder like you know oh like pissing yeah
[2771.13s -> 2782.54s]  shame on you and you can't here's the thing about a pool there is no verifying anything in a pool
[2782.54s -> 2789.42s]  a lot of times there is absolutely no verification so somebody could just be in there pissing and
[2789.42s -> 2795.85s]  it's just like I have no idea and nobody else does and no one will ever know there's no verification
[2795.85s -> 2818.22s]  when somebody goes in a pool oh that hurts oh they weren't kidding that actually hurt a lot
[2818.78s -> 2831.96s]  I got a huge raid slime cycle thanks to the raid welcome everybody we're just chilling out playing
[2831.96s -> 2836.76s]  some chop goblins we played resident evil 4 earlier resident 4 remake mercenaries it was fun
[2837.56s -> 2843.38s]  but thanks hope you had a good stream we're currently talking about um nothing in particular
[2843.38s -> 2849.50s]  just uh I want a little personal pool but I'm never gonna have it but it's like one of the
[2849.50s -> 2850.86s]  things I would really like to have
[2860.30s -> 2863.90s]  all right I'm gonna die I don't even know this is a save point I think you just have to beat the

[2909.80s -> 2914.22s]  what's your favorite food is different like obviously like in the world I know but like
[2914.22s -> 2919.58s]  this right here this is how this looks is one of my top 50 favorite things in the world
[2924.30s -> 2937.18s]  just like bright blue clean clear water in a box is really high up there I know a lot of you get
[2937.18s -> 2954.22s]  it any type of large square or circle container with nice pristine blue water in it what about
[2954.22s -> 2982.31s]  an aquarium yeah secret door maybe it's this one really I like that sound too it kind of like
[2982.31s -> 2993.38s]  bubbling water even just saying bubbling water there it is it's my favorite thing in the world
[2993.38s -> 3006.50s]  right here all right I need to stop because I'm dead get out of my pool that's my pool
[3007.14s -> 3017.50s]  he's gonna go piss in that pool in front of me oh shit okay I actually I have to be a gamer now
[3025.14s -> 3041.27s]  he died in the pool okay you know those shows where they um they kind of redo your whole house
[3043.22s -> 3047.46s]  and after a week you come back and they you have like a blindfold on and you take it off in the
[3047.46s -> 3053.45s]  living room and it's like oh my goodness look at all this it doesn't matter what my house or
[3053.45s -> 3058.57s]  what my apartment whatever it looked like before just in the middle of the living room just make
[3058.57s -> 3065.67s]  a nice pristine blue square chest high pool and I'm gonna cry I'm gonna do this I'm gonna be like
[3065.67s -> 3074.33s]  I can't even look what they put in they put the pool they did what I liked I would cry
[3077.82s -> 3081.66s]  and they could be rotten wood all over here and I wouldn't matter as long as I was there
[3082.38s -> 3105.53s]  all right this game just got this game just got a little harder good I don't have any ammo I need
[3105.53s -> 3121.27s]  to get ammo with this gun equipped thank you those guys hurt a lot I should probably parry
[3121.99s -> 3142.73s]  can I parry those are they too big maybe I actually did it thank goodness yeah it but the
[3142.73s -> 3154.10s]  water has to be faintly lit with like a light blue like kind of slightly teal light and the
[3154.10s -> 3180.18s]  twinsons odyssey soundtrack has to play in the background all right just pull them in here why
[3180.90s -> 3208.38s]  look it up look up that soundtrack and you tell me why I should play that game on stream nice
[3209.26s -> 3227.32s]  you should play every game of existence on steam I don't think uh
[3228.20s -> 3233.98s]  twinsons odyssey is on steam is it it's the sequel to little big adventure a little big
[3233.98s -> 3247.26s]  venture 2 it's on steam what how did I not know that that's like in my top that's probably my
[3247.26s -> 3267.70s]  top 20 favorite games ever made it's on steam buddy ooh okay add that to the list hello trinch
[3268.34s -> 3274.94s]  how great is mr twinson I have I done this I feel like I've played this on no maybe not maybe not
[3278.09s -> 3286.49s]  those of you that know you know about that game but I don't know maybe not maybe I thought about
[3286.49s -> 3291.29s]  wanting to do it years ago and I just never did it there's a remaster of the two games coming up
[3291.29s -> 3306.76s]  and lba3 has been announced you're gonna make me cry do not put the lba2 soundtrack on in my pool
[3307.40s -> 3335.70s]  and tell me that there is a sequel coming out while I soak in this did I think so I don't know
[3335.70s -> 3343.74s]  who did the voice acting in that game but it is unironically and I mean this I mean this 100
[3343.74s -> 3354.90s]  truthfully that game has some of the best voice acting of any game I've ever played get those
[3354.90s -> 3363.98s]  coins um I will it's no I think it's less than a few people even doing the voice work and they do
[3363.98s -> 3370.23s]  dozens of characters and they're so good there's so much life and so much energy and so much
[3371.03s -> 3377.86s]  passion in that voice work it just trust me when I tell you it's phenomenal the characters that
[3377.86s -> 3384.36s]  people do oh the elephant voices oh my goodness you're gonna make me cry all right I didn't get
[3384.36s -> 3392.73s]  the coins why are you walking in circles uh oh right should we should we tell all right let's
[3392.73s -> 3397.05s]  tell them when I get on a topic uh I will just walk in a circle and just forget that I'm playing
[3397.05s -> 3402.17s]  a video game and just it's probably annoying I'm sorry I've been doing this for like 12 years
[3402.17s -> 3409.51s]  I'm sorry has there ever been a time when I played a game and didn't just like absent-mindedly go on
[3409.51s -> 3429.85s]  autopilot in a circle while I was talking no it's never happened oh nice you don't have a
[3429.85s -> 3436.63s]  multitasking talent you know I can carry a lot of things at the same time I don't know if that
[3436.63s -> 3445.58s]  counts but you bet your ass I'm getting the entire grocery run in one go does that count
[3452.66s -> 3458.42s]  that's multitasking you got one on your pinky hanging one on your thumb one sort of wrapped
[3458.42s -> 3464.66s]  around your left hand one gripped you have it bunched up tight you take the two ends and you
[3464.66s -> 3473.56s]  bunch it up tight you got like 10 bags in your hand that's just a that's not a multitask oh can
[3473.56s -> 3490.06s]  you sing while you do it too okay back off what's the point of this room it's the build the wall

[3512.82s -> 3539.45s]  wait here we go oh I think I just like natural shit remember I told you one of my favorite things
[3539.45s -> 3546.01s]  is the sticky kind of gooey lava where it's charcoal looking and then they hit it with that
[3546.01s -> 3556.01s]  little stick and it opens up and it's like lava I want a room like this too in my house it's like
[3556.65s -> 3579.59s]  jello it's a weird thick jello lava dude wants a lava pit in his room yeah that like rolling thick
[3579.59s -> 3588.18s]  sludge it's really thick I should have been like a scientist like a viola I don't know I should
[3588.18s -> 3602.20s]  have gone into something to do with that it's still time it's still time I hope this doesn't
[3602.20s -> 3637.19s]  kill me instantly I'm afraid my god oh my god how do I get up should be a geologist
[3640.84s -> 3650.54s]  a lot of cool things to do I mean I could always just wear a like a fisherman's cap and have
[3651.18s -> 3656.76s]  sunscreen all over my nose I have like a bowling shirt on with a camera around my neck and a
[3656.76s -> 3662.52s]  fanny pack and have my wrists both of them planted on my back walking around and following the other
[3662.52s -> 3668.04s]  scientists going like wow what you wow look at that oh wow oh can I get a picture of that

[3696.50s -> 3739.37s]  shit okay that was hard just checking in how's your health going it's going all right it's going
[3739.37s -> 3748.94s]  good I would tell you if it was any major changes or anything I think another big part of this year
[3748.94s -> 3755.67s]  too my right and I told you guys about I'm slowing down a little bit there's a lot that goes into
[3755.67s -> 3785.43s]  that so the wand is stored in this temple the correct symbols must be nearby symbols are nearby
[3798.20s -> 3818.76s]  shit nearby was anybody paying attention to symbols because I wasn't one doesn't kill me
[3827.50s -> 3855.50s]  oh okay triangle um it's a circle with two legs uh what's his name cubert and then m this way e
[3855.50s -> 3885.37s]  that way w the other way oh yeah let's see that looks like what I need how's Joel doing
[3885.45s -> 3899.00s]  oh jill's doing good okay well I just used one of 10 I just used 10% of this thing's power
[3899.64s -> 3902.68s]  which was a stupid idea because I probably have to all right don't use it again
[3903.48s -> 3933.62s]  where to my neighbor got a new car today and he's been standing outside staring at it while eating
[3933.62s -> 3966.90s]  chips 15 minutes oh I get that I get that well it's pretty good again you find yourself in a
[3966.90s -> 3973.13s]  whirlwind of colors the last thing you heard was the familiar sound the az tech time manipulation
[3973.13s -> 3978.65s]  tablet activating this must be their final dreadful bid for victory you emerge in a desolate
[3978.65s -> 3985.96s]  wasteland a future that is not what could be they've transported you to an alternate timeline
[3985.96s -> 3993.54s]  a grimy sci-fi dystopia where the chop goblins already won you stand in their vile capital city
[3993.54s -> 3998.92s]  chopping grad surrounded by the ruins of human civilization in front of a strange industrial
[3998.92s -> 4006.47s]  structure must be their hq you grip the staff of the corinthians with rage a world overrun by
[4006.47s -> 4014.12s]  chop goblins just means more chop goblins to shoot it's time for the final battle the hack
[4014.76s -> 4019.98s]  goblinators are part goblin part machine they have transcended the bounds of flesh
[4019.98s -> 4024.81s]  and are faster and more cunning than the other chop goblins relentlessly flanking their foes
[4024.81s -> 4044.10s]  and attacking with deadly laser cleavers final level I think so I only have six more shots with
[4044.10s -> 4047.56s]  this I don't think I'm going to use it till the very end this is my resident evil rocket launcher
[4049.16s -> 4069.59s]  whoa okay they're already I gotta learn the reflect is so powerful probably I can't I love
[4069.59s -> 4099.21s]  this music play lifeline again no no way that I think I'm just sealed that's getting sealed
[4099.21s -> 4110.60s]  it's permanently didn't I beat it I beat that game already didn't I or did I just pretend that I did
[4110.60s -> 4118.22s]  in my brain so I don't ever play it again yeah I beat it the game was hell that old ps2
[4118.30s -> 4126.04s]  mic was so bad yeah I remember the very end the blast battle was that huge robotic monster thing
[4126.04s -> 4157.21s]  right I can't believe I actually beat that game um where do I go oh that's cool a motherboard
[4157.21s -> 4205.22s]  building didn't miss something where's the where's game progress the lever I didn't pull why did I
[4205.22s -> 4227.06s]  do that you beat it I don't think I did it's to your left did you play seaman again no you guys
[4227.06s -> 4236.71s]  have to understand the reason why the oh the re hold on the reason why those games were some
[4236.71s -> 4240.63s]  of the longest streams I've ever done is because I didn't want to turn those games on ever again
[4241.51s -> 4245.99s]  because I know if I turned the dreamcast off that game would never be opened again
[4246.63s -> 4250.23s]  so I had to stick with it because that was the only time you were ever going to see that
[4250.23s -> 4264.30s]  so it had to be like a 13 hour 14 hour stream same thing with the lord of the rings games
[4265.02s -> 4269.42s]  those old lord of the rings games were so hard and just so crazy it's so frustrating
[4270.30s -> 4278.30s]  there's no way I was gonna open it again and you know that if I didn't beat those games in one day
[4281.37s -> 4287.45s]  you guys would a week would go by hey dude no that lord of the rings stream was really really fun
[4287.45s -> 4293.26s]  and really funny like that you are you gonna ever finish it yeah yeah I don't know maybe like in a
[4293.26s -> 4297.34s]  maybe some point soon then a year will go by and it's never it's never happened
[4297.98s -> 4321.42s]  I need ammo I reflect it wait where's this dead what about pajama sam
[4325.13s -> 4332.66s]  I mean there's a lot of games to play just do I really want to play them for more than a few

[4428.18s -> 4437.18s]  go back to yakuza ever again I know I think yakuza actually could probably see a pretty major return
[4437.98s -> 4451.34s]  especially with more streams like this it's kind of pick something just
[4451.34s -> 4465.74s]  jumping it play it I don't even think about it let me make sure I'm at full health I don't
