[7.03s -> 13.29s]  Hello, when you call me early? I don't think I'm early. I think I'm right on time.
[15.61s -> 24.12s]  Hey, by the way, since doing the new schedule, once a week, Andy, I don't think I've been late
[24.12s -> 28.92s]  at all. I think I've started at exactly 12 to 12.01. Wait, no, that was the one, there was one time
[30.41s -> 33.69s]  where my computer was freaking out. Binding of Isaac was freaking out.
[35.38s -> 39.14s]  But for the most part, like 80% of the time, it's been exactly at 12 PM.
[39.86s -> 55.83s]  How you doing? How was how was your week? Is it good? Well, I'm Andy. Today, we're gonna be playing
[57.00s -> 61.08s]  a new game. I know everyone did. Oh, you don't want to hear that. We're playing Pokemon Snap
[62.39s -> 70.12s]  Switch Edition. I do have a problem with the title. I don't know. I don't know what is with
[70.12s -> 76.41s]  Nintendo in this shit. They're the only people that do this. Nintendo is the only company besides
[77.05s -> 85.37s]  some furniture cleaning companies and like Lysol spray type companies that put new in front of
[85.37s -> 94.49s]  stuff. And has made a new product. New OxiClean. New Pokemon Snap. New Super Mario Brothers.
[95.21s -> 99.13s]  The only company that is one of four kind of companies that do this.
[99.13s -> 105.66s]  Like Pokemon Snap. You can't come up with a better name than New Pokemon Snap.
[106.38s -> 114.26s]  That was a pre-written joke. Oh, you better believe it was. It wasn't. I came up with that
[114.26s -> 121.22s]  right now. I'm just sitting here like I got a notepad with a bunch of potential intro jokes.
[121.78s -> 126.18s]  And I'm going to use them. Like I wrote them down. I'm a comedian. I know comedy.
[127.46s -> 136.55s]  I know it. Tell me I don't. This game suck. I don't know. It has a camera and you take pictures of
[136.55s -> 142.89s]  different Pokemons. Oh, I'm kind of excited. It's a camera. The game with a camera.
[144.92s -> 154.95s]  You have a plan B. No. Well, hold on. I had a plan A. This is the plan B. If you must know.
[155.75s -> 165.11s]  So I had plan A. Plan A was I downloaded, I don't know, maybe 30 to 40 dog shit iPad games.
[165.98s -> 173.22s]  And was going to do a dog shit iPad game stream. And what happened was started to kind of vet them
[173.22s -> 180.18s]  a little bit. And none of them were fun or funny. So I have to kind of go back to the drawing board
[180.18s -> 185.56s]  on that one. Like they would just like I start I like opened them and realized they would just
[185.56s -> 192.89s]  kind of like take over my iPad and shit. It like wasn't even worth doing. So like six made it out
[192.89s -> 197.37s]  of like the 40 that I found. So it's gonna have to happen is over the next probably week or two.
[197.37s -> 204.47s]  I'm going to compile more and do that at some point. That was the plan A. This is the plan B.
[204.47s -> 215.80s]  The virus stream. So you downloaded viruses willingly. Yes. They're not viruses. They're just
[215.80s -> 225.45s]  bad. All right. You know what like probably the worst insult to like a game designer is?
[226.09s -> 234.06s]  Like a game developer. Is if you call their game a virus game. Because that just means that holy
[234.06s -> 240.70s]  shit this was so bad. That like I think it may have infected my computer. That's bottom. Absolute
[240.70s -> 249.35s]  bottom of the barrel to be to have you to say that about somebody's game. I just like I just
[249.35s -> 255.74s]  made that game for fun. I just was like playing around in like unity. This is a virus game. Oh,
[256.62s -> 268.28s]  would you at least have said cereal box? All right. You guys ready? I'm ready to play this.
[268.28s -> 274.06s]  By the way, this is the first Pokemon game I've played on the channel. You count the the TV one
[274.94s -> 283.75s]  like watch TV with Pikachu. I guess that's that count. Does this game count? Is this non-canon?
[284.47s -> 296.57s]  I don't know. What did you say? Oh my god. I'm so tired of this schedule. I'd rather you stream
[296.57s -> 302.81s]  one minute a day per week. I would have. All right. I would have been gone five minutes ago.
[303.93s -> 308.89s]  That would be the shittiest content. Can you imagine if I just showed up for a minute and then left?
[310.26s -> 313.86s]  That's just enough time to remind a bunch of people that their sub is running out.
[315.56s -> 327.64s]  Yeah, I'm not going to do that. All right. Let's go. Leave now. All right. English. Please select
[327.64s -> 337.99s]  your appearance. You can't change your appearance. This kind of looks like me. Which one? I have blue
[337.99s -> 350.98s]  eyes. This is me. Jeremy. Sure. I'm just going to be. I guess I'm just going to be Jeremy.
[350.98s -> 362.49s]  That's me. I'm not being a character today. It's just me. What do you mean today? I'm not being a
[362.49s -> 371.10s]  character today. Like do I normally? Am I normally a fucking character? What am I talking about?
[371.10s -> 378.71s]  No, I'm going to be me today. Why does the snap look so blown up and like awful looking?
[378.71s -> 394.57s]  Is that a Pokemon? Get Pikachu out of here. They only put him in here for fucking nostalgia.
[394.57s -> 401.78s]  I want the new Pokemon. I don't care about Pikachu. He's in. He's only in here for nostalgia.
[401.78s -> 411.80s]  Greetings. True. Hi there. I'm glad you made it. Who's the professor that everyone was pissed
[411.80s -> 416.60s]  off that I didn't know who it was? It's not Professor Mirror, right? It was Professor Oak.
[416.60s -> 422.49s]  It's the one that I didn't know and everyone freaked out. Welcome to the Laboratory of
[422.49s -> 430.49s]  Ecology and Natural Sciences or LENS for short. My name is Mirror. Yeah, I didn't know who Professor
[430.49s -> 437.21s]  Oak was. I'm researching Pokemon and their natural environment here on Florio Island.
[438.60s -> 442.52s]  Yeah, and that's not all. The professor is going to study every single island here in the Lental
[442.52s -> 449.93s]  region. No one's ever done an ecological survey like this before. It's going to be amazing.
[451.78s -> 458.68s]  No one? Aren't you forgetting a certain explorer? Are Pokemons considered wild animals?
[458.68s -> 466.63s]  Is that- what are- are they- are they- yes, they are, yeah. I don't know if they were like-
[466.63s -> 470.38s]  they're supposed to be like cartoons or something. I'm gonna keep going.
[472.63s -> 481.43s]  It's a good point. You've read the stories of Captain Vince. I don't know anything about- I
[481.43s -> 484.79s]  don't know anything about Pokemon. This is the worst channel you could watch right now that's
[484.79s -> 490.17s]  playing this. I'm just going to criticize and annoy you if you're a fan of this universe.
[490.73s -> 494.89s]  This is the game you play if you're a fan of the universe. This is like the side
[494.89s -> 498.81s]  I'm a fan of the universe game. I'm not a fan of the universe and here I am.
[498.81s -> 510.63s]  I just like cameras in video games. Well, thanks. This is Rita. Her parents are good friends of mine.
[510.63s -> 516.02s]  She's here on vacation while her school's on break. I'm not just here to goof off, Professor.
[516.02s -> 520.18s]  I'm your research assistant. Ah yes, that's right, and I appreciate the help.
[521.16s -> 526.12s]  Now before we go over what you'll be doing in this program, why don't we step into the lab
[526.12s -> 534.82s]  and get settled? Right, you are, Professor. I'll lead the way. Camera Andy. Yeah, it's fun.
[535.46s -> 542.31s]  I see you got yourself a fucking gamer chair over there. All right, let me- allow me to explain.
[542.87s -> 549.74s]  Yeah, these are wild animals in this person's house. That's what I was talking about. Like,
[550.46s -> 555.02s]  these wild animals just run around in this house? The lentil region is absolutely teeming with
[555.02s -> 561.38s]  Pokemon. Photographing those Pokemon helps us learn more about them and their ecosystem.
[561.38s -> 569.35s]  They can be tamed. Yeah, all right, I understand. You've watched the one YouTube video.
[569.91s -> 576.23s]  Of the guy that has like the alligator as a pet. And it has like 1.6 million views. And we've all
[576.23s -> 579.51s]  seen it. And we're like, holy shit, that's fucking crazy. But you don't actually have an alligator
[579.51s -> 590.70s]  in your house. You're not going to. It's like three people on earth. A fatal frame. And now you might
[590.70s -> 595.85s]  even get to see glowing Pokemon. They're really- really. Now without further ado, here's your
[595.85s -> 601.66s]  research camera. Oh, there- that's pretty- that's pretty shitty for a camera that I'm gonna get.
[601.66s -> 605.18s]  It looks like a Walmart disposable camera. You- you couldn't have ponied up a little bit more
[605.18s -> 611.37s]  research money and get me a fucking DSLR? I've got the same one. We can use them to communicate
[611.37s -> 617.11s]  with each other and the rest of the team too. That's right. It's more than just a camera. It
[617.11s -> 623.42s]  lets you keep in touch and analyze data on the fly. So it's an iPhone. Yep. Yep. It'll also serve
[623.42s -> 632.78s]  as a sort of an ID badge for you here. So take good care of it. Wait, it's an ID? Now remember,
[632.78s -> 636.79s]  son, there's only 25 photos on there. And what you're going to do is you're going to take that
[636.79s -> 642.55s]  to a wedding. You're going to take nine pictures. There's going to be 21 more photos on it. It's
[642.55s -> 647.29s]  going to sit in your closet for 16 years. You're going to take it out. You're going to take 10 more
[647.29s -> 652.07s]  pictures on it. You're going to put it back in your closet. Two more years go by. You're going
[652.07s -> 661.78s]  to throw it in the trash and never get the photos developed. Awesome, right? The professor invented
[661.78s -> 668.62s]  it. Can I explain how to use it, professor? You're projecting again. I mean, I've done that like
[668.62s -> 677.43s]  probably four or five times. Who's ever developed photos from one of those cameras? Can I explain
[677.43s -> 682.49s]  how to use it, professor? Everything, Rita. Assist away. I'll go take care of some other
[682.49s -> 687.90s]  preparations. All right, come on. Let's go outside. I can't wait to take my first photo
[687.90s -> 693.10s]  as a photo Pokemon journalist. Tutorials are based on the default button layouts. Yeah. All right.
[693.10s -> 705.19s]  Perfect timing. Let me shoot it. All right. Press A to take a photo. I can't move the camera.
[705.19s -> 718.92s]  It was a bad picture. All right. That's A. Okay. And it's shaped like a Pokeball.
[719.72s -> 731.24s]  Okay. Oh, I see. All right. So we've got to get the house in the frame too.
[731.24s -> 735.05s]  You can point the camera all the way around.
[735.05s -> 739.86s]  Imagine needing to tell somebody how to use a camera. You can use a camera too.
[741.62s -> 748.28s]  Am I a caveman? Why do they have to teach me this? Oh, look. Here comes a Pikachu.
[750.84s -> 759.85s]  Oh, what's the zoom button? You're a small child. No, I'm not. How old is this kid? Like fucking 12?
[759.85s -> 770.41s]  That's old enough to know how to use a camera. First move so it's lined up with Pikachu. Okay.
[771.13s -> 775.61s]  Yeah, but who does a center shot? Amateur? It needs to be like over here. And I know
[775.61s -> 781.29s]  someone's going to go, rule of thirds is bullshit. Don't use it. I use it. I think it looks good.
[782.01s -> 802.38s]  I did. Okay. So there's like a face recognition. I always turn that off. I hate that. Got it. You're
[802.38s -> 812.22s]  using it wrong. I don't even have control of the camera right now. It's called zooming in.
[813.82s -> 827.02s]  Oh, ZL. Okay. Nice and big. Oh my God. Okay. Got it. See how much bigger it looked?
[830.78s -> 834.46s]  Do you want your subject's whole body in the middle of the frame? No, you don't.
[845.22s -> 850.10s]  Nice and big. Okay. Controls are setting me. Pause menu. All right.
[852.18s -> 858.82s]  Oh, you taught him how to use a camera. Great. Now let's teach him how to pour cereal into a bowl.
[859.62s -> 869.27s]  How to flush the toilet. And the very hard task of making your bed. How was that? I hope you're
[869.27s -> 880.31s]  getting the hang of your research camera. Do you mind choosing one shot of each Pokemon you've
[880.31s -> 885.34s]  photographed? I'll rate them using my special scoring system. Pick whichever shots you think
[885.34s -> 895.54s]  are the best. I only took like two pictures. Like the Pikachu folder. I have folders? Okay.
[896.18s -> 899.62s]  You can choose a photo by moving the pointer. Press A when you've decided which one to show me.
[902.84s -> 910.30s]  That one. All right. How about the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,
[910.46s -> 921.29s]  the. Okay. I only took one picture. Press or select show professor. Show him.
[924.42s -> 934.31s]  Okay. What does he think? Starting with photo number one. It's beautiful. Oh, it's Pikachu.
[934.31s -> 939.80s]  This is the first time you've gotten it as your subject. Pose, size, direction placement, other
[939.80s -> 947.62s]  Pokemon background from one to four stars. I came up with a system to help us understand and
[947.62s -> 955.64s]  categorize how pokemon behave photos of pokemon in an ordinary state get fewer stars more unusual
[955.64s -> 961.64s]  behavior means more stars all right he's gotta get him doing weird cool stuff be clear the number
[961.64s -> 968.36s]  of a star a photo receives doesn't affect its score every category is important by the way the
[968.36s -> 973.32s]  camera keeps logs of what was happening when you took each photo that data helps me categorize your
[973.96s -> 998.81s]  what does that mean hold on let me get auto auto you want to come up let's hear that i have
[999.86s -> 1025.48s]  hold on i was clearing out my closet hey show auto oh you didn't think what you put excuse
[1025.48s -> 1031.82s]  me you didn't think that you were going to be able to see something important you were going to see
[1031.90s -> 1054.97s]  a mustache shit lord it's not really there we go oh my pants my pants are unzipped are they
[1056.41s -> 1063.45s]  my pants are unzipped oh my god i think my pants are unzipped no they're not okay holy shit that
[1063.45s -> 1071.66s]  was just the most terrifying thing i've ever done in my life i think like that was like in my mind
[1071.66s -> 1078.07s]  my career ended i'll be honest with you what going through my brain was my career is over
[1078.07s -> 1084.23s]  it's it's over i like my like there's my like my it's open that's my biggest fucking fear
[1085.03s -> 1106.22s]  but in what what what's the matter he's got a problem i pull out a lightsaber like oh this is
[1106.22s -> 1112.47s]  like it's like dick is out that's like i'm gone forever but i mean that would be like really
[1112.47s -> 1118.74s]  really funny way to go out that would be like fucking crazy like what i would live forever
[1120.65s -> 1126.33s]  that would be like that would be an image or a video that would be shared forever like i would
[1126.33s -> 1142.10s]  be i would live forever anyways by the way the camera keeps logs of what was happening what was
[1142.10s -> 1155.32s]  i doing okay let's move on to the scoring i'll evaluate the subject's pose snapping your photo
[1155.32s -> 1161.78s]  at just the right moment is key to getting a high pose score i didn't show auto i did not i was i
[1161.78s -> 1170.12s]  hold on i'll show him like in a few weeks okay so it's pose the larger your subject is in the photo
[1170.12s -> 1177.75s]  the better and there's the direction the pokemon is facing so you want to be big facing you doing
[1177.75s -> 1187.98s]  a cool pose center of the frame bonus of this other pokemon in the photo all right i just take
[1187.98s -> 1201.13s]  good photos whatever so why is it right in the center that's not usually good pictures it's
[1201.13s -> 1208.92s]  hard to believe you're a beginner all right well i don't want to save this that photo i don't want
[1208.92s -> 1219.78s]  it in my album but that one's not as good okay good pose bad direction though how is direction
[1219.78s -> 1237.11s]  better than size which one is a pokemon they're all pokemon they're not supposed to be artistic
[1237.11s -> 1243.94s]  photos well i'm gonna take some liberty and do that i'm gonna have some artistic photos
[1244.50s -> 1256.12s]  but i'm supposed to just zoom in and take a picture of their face i'm an artist i should be
[1256.12s -> 1266.30s]  treated as such this is for scientific research look at this pod it'll carry you on your photography
[1266.30s -> 1275.45s]  expeditions it's called the neo one it's the best it can teleport to far off places in no time
[1275.45s -> 1282.02s]  flat you all know i like that word and every time i get a chance to say it i love saying it i finally
[1282.02s -> 1287.27s]  put the finishing touches on it not long ago with a little help from someone i know see it makes use
[1287.27s -> 1293.86s]  of energy hotspots scattered throughout the lentil region come on professor the details can wait
[1293.86s -> 1302.14s]  all right let's let's go climb on in and touch your camera to the console what like the switch
[1302.14s -> 1324.30s]  calls oh he has to do it i'm like fucking 12 they just put me in an experimental like traveling pod
[1324.30s -> 1329.30s]  i don't have a license what they were just concerned about me not knowing how to use a
[1329.30s -> 1340.87s]  camera they're gonna make me go drive a car oh here we go here we go all right oh beautiful
[1341.43s -> 1355.21s]  all right this weird guy over here that's a good one got it come on right into the camera come

[1403.83s -> 1418.34s]  artistic photo it's above the the weeds what's that thing this is this is like too easy isn't it
[1419.43s -> 1425.75s]  this is easy this is a ride this is just a ride at disney world what this is not hard
[1426.55s -> 1436.52s]  it is all right here to take a picture of and it's moving for me this is a kid's game what
[1441.00s -> 1447.16s]  i just ride around and take pictures i thought this is going to be like hard to do this or
[1447.16s -> 1455.77s]  something i don't know this is so many pictures you're a child how many how many pokemons are
[1455.77s -> 1472.20s]  in the game ready got it perfect that's a perfect photo okay uh here we go you guys ready if you
[1472.20s -> 1478.20s]  were i got it if you were to offer me a million dollars right now for me to name these as they
[1478.20s -> 1484.46s]  come on screen i wouldn't be able to do it i wouldn't be able to get one let's see if i can
[1484.46s -> 1503.85s]  get one uh it just showed me and i don't i don't remember i'm flying above what's that is it
[1504.81s -> 1528.74s]  what is a hoot hoot come here that was a bee doof right into the camera turn right is he gonna stay
[1529.38s -> 1537.58s]  i gotta get him flying by he's gonna fly right here and i'm gonna get it oh my god that was
[1537.58s -> 1554.30s]  this guy just wants me to take a picture of him whoa get that these are pokemons what the
[1554.30s -> 1560.20s]  fuck are these things all right they ran out of ideas they ran out of ideas this is like it's like
[1560.20s -> 1577.98s]  a friendship bracelet that's not even a pokemon what is that what's that basically it's the end
[1577.98s -> 1593.53s]  of the course okay so in conclusion it's this so basically it's this in theory it's this
[1594.49s -> 1600.71s]  anime does that a lot doesn't it a character will be talking and then they'll go
[1600.71s -> 1609.69s]  in conclusion i think that this this this this in theory this this this this therefore
[1610.25s -> 1619.67s]  this this this this okay i took 39 photos now just like before it's time to show me some photos you
[1619.67s -> 1634.22s]  took stop talking go ahead and choose one photo oh i can only choose one photo per pokemon oh man

[1806.28s -> 1817.10s]  size direction placement it's not bad it's a gold star yeah it's one to four stars
[1818.87s -> 1830.26s]  that one's not good but it's still it conveys a lot of emotion i think that conveys a lot less
[1830.26s -> 1842.76s]  than a thousand right now too that's fine it conveys sadness keychu that one's bad too but
[1842.76s -> 1854.25s]  he wasn't he was i couldn't get a good photo of him he was like far away it was the first

[1928.20s -> 1932.92s]  just take a photo of something close what's in the middle of the frame that's the best you're
[1932.92s -> 1947.05s]  gonna get size direction placement yeah that's a five thousand dollar play here comes the sus fans
[1947.05s -> 1956.10s]  same with this one i gotta get other other animals i'm gonna call them animals i'm not
[1956.10s -> 1959.94s]  calling them pokemons i want i'm gonna say animals it's way easier for me to say
[1966.54s -> 1985.30s]  oh i refuse to say pokemons i'm gonna say animals is that is that its butt do i get um
[1986.10s -> 1992.26s]  they're getting upgrades research oh here we go i need 40 000 points to get a research level too
[1993.06s -> 2005.66s]  holy shit i'm almost there bus guy doesn't like pokemon hey went thanks for the 20 community subs
[2006.22s -> 2012.66s]  20 subs from went thank you thank you though that's a lot once that level goes up you may
[2012.66s -> 2016.74s]  see pokemon behave in ways you haven't seen before the key to raising your research level is to
[2016.74s -> 2022.98s]  observe all types of animal behavior that means getting photographs of them in every category
[2022.98s -> 2032.95s]  from one to four so in short fill up that photo that animal photo library keep that in mind and
[2032.95s -> 2037.59s]  you'll be on the right track but get out there and snap lots of photos and cherish the encounters
[2037.59s -> 2042.95s]  with the animals you have along the way way easier i'd never have guessed it was your first trip out
[2042.95s -> 2050.58s]  there keep up the good work is this do an ipad present there's an ipad present i didn't but i
[2050.58s -> 2055.06s]  had to touch the screen for that to be an ipad present you researched lorio nature park for the
[2055.06s -> 2060.78s]  first time you got a score of a thousand points or more in the direction category during a photo
[2060.78s -> 2068.54s]  evaluation you got a score of a thousand in the placement category yep save the photos you took
[2068.54s -> 2076.55s]  to your album um yes after your research trips you can choose photos to save to your album which
[2076.55s -> 2082.50s]  is in your space in the lab you can also choose re-snap to make some changes to the photos before
[2082.50s -> 2102.02s]  you save them okay i want where i want this one look at that re-snap wow this is awesome okay
[2102.02s -> 2123.19s]  hold on no i want the focal point to be there we go no no i want it close not far away don't
[2123.19s -> 2131.30s]  rest in sleep for me this is a good photo relax where's the where's the focal point i want it like
[2131.30s -> 2140.12s]  right where can i get it i can't see it where is it this isn't doing anything well i want the focal
[2140.12s -> 2168.62s]  point up front how come it's not just not changing anything oh there we go okay perfect i zoom in i
[2168.62s -> 2195.22s]  put the camera down that's gotta be up here like that yep perfect a little bit higher wow oh oh
[2195.86s -> 2210.50s]  oh these filters what the fuck are these why is it green they're all just silhouettes with
[2210.50s -> 2236.02s]  different colors yeah that's fine all right snap that photo right there save this photo yes building
[2236.02s -> 2242.20s]  a lodge okay i'm ready i don't need to save anymore these is the fucking tutorial i'm done
[2247.03s -> 2262.33s]  fable 2 fable 2 fable 2 i'll see you with fable 2 next week you didn't save it what
[2262.33s -> 2270.65s]  it's going to nighttime photo shoot by the way don't forget you can come back to the lab and
[2270.65s -> 2278.57s]  take a look at your photo decks anytime cool this is fable 2 essentially well don't let me
[2278.57s -> 2289.51s]  keep you any longer have a good time and snap some photos all right let's go for it lab research i
[2289.51s -> 2297.06s]  want to i'm i think this is fun are you really gonna play this for eight hours i don't know
[2297.78s -> 2306.60s]  play the baseball game again i'm taking pictures of animals right now all right don't worry i'll
[2306.60s -> 2319.58s]  play pac-man 99 later and like mario 30 whatever it is you head on another expedition now before
[2319.58s -> 2324.44s]  you go let me tell you one more thing you can do with your research camera you can run a scan
[2325.00s -> 2329.83s]  that'll give you a thesis about your surroundings cool tells you about nearby animals and points
[2329.83s -> 2337.21s]  out anything unusual what counts as unusual you've never given me a solid answer it's why is it gonna
[2337.21s -> 2345.22s]  have ski goggles i don't know what it was that for is he like welding pokemon together inside
[2345.22s -> 2349.48s]  of this basement or something why does he have those basically anything that makes the system
[2349.48s -> 2359.90s]  go check this out well i guess that's all the detail we're gonna get those are lab goggles
[2362.50s -> 2371.70s]  are they they look kind of huge why does he need what what do you okay what does he need them for
[2371.70s -> 2374.90s]  she doesn't have them i don't have them why does he have those what are they for
[2375.46s -> 2381.59s]  because of chemicals i don't know what what chemicals with with the animals the pokemon
[2381.59s -> 2400.50s]  in his house what do you do what why doesn't use them move on that's fucking weird i already
[2400.50s -> 2409.18s]  i'm holding all right running a scan x's scan okay i can scan whatever i want
[2411.34s -> 2415.10s]  oh that's cool that's not a pokemon that's a car
[2415.82s -> 2422.09s]  hmm
[2424.49s -> 2437.27s]  okay i did oh i can analyze it analyze neo one this vehicle is essential for your pokemon research
[2437.91s -> 2444.55s]  why did you say that now i have to say it why did you do that why did you do that
[2445.67s -> 2453.91s]  now i just looked over i saw it now i have to say erin i had erin erin erin erin why did you do that

[2923.86s -> 2937.24s]  i was at a two star photo is horrible wait this how is that this one's better how is that one
[2937.24s -> 2947.54s]  better all right let's go oh i have to do from every folder and none of these none of these are
[2947.54s -> 2961.82s]  worth pulling in i mean that one's kind of cool no these are like they suck not better but more
[2961.82s -> 2977.58s]  special okay pose is worse size is worse everything is worse but placement well i'm not keeping this
[2977.58s -> 2989.90s]  one the old one that's the same picture i took before what's the difference i want to know what
[2989.90s -> 3005.40s]  the difference is the only difference is two of their eyes are closed it's a worse photo okay the
[3005.40s -> 3023.24s]  pose is probably better i could work on size all right now this is a three star three star pose
[3023.24s -> 3029.99s]  size direction placement that's not that's three gold stars that's gonna be worth a lot
[3030.63s -> 3040.44s]  oh is this one okay i did you guys hear that did you did you hear that did that pick up on the mic
[3041.08s -> 3045.42s]  did anybody hear that like
[3048.38s -> 3062.15s]  that was the lightsaber i didn't touch it it just like turned on i didn't do anything this one's
[3062.15s -> 3069.00s]  bad too but it's probably fine all right i'll be at research research level um two right we got
[3069.00s -> 3079.53s]  another 10 you know how we say it here stay with me another 10 community subs from wenty lair
[3084.68s -> 3088.46s]  all right let's step forward for our research i bet i bet animals in the area are getting
[3088.46s -> 3094.58s]  comfortable with you by the way thanks to the progress you've made in your research i've got
[3094.58s -> 3099.50s]  something to report i feel even once your photos are squared away i think you'll be pleased to hear
[3099.50s -> 3107.54s]  this all right should i save any of these no none of these did it for me except for maybe this one
[3108.26s -> 3134.62s]  i'm relating to like the bird photos these are awful how are these filters these are terrible
[3135.34s -> 3146.97s]  i was i was thinking of like snapchat instagram filters like iphone filters
[3148.84s -> 3158.20s]  you get better ones later oh all right then we'll fuck this i'm out none of these weren't any good
[3158.20s -> 3173.00s]  wait that one's kind of cool saving that one how does this boomer know what snapchat is
[3173.72s -> 3182.70s]  like you're not you're telling me that you dive you've never downloaded snapchat and put like
[3183.26s -> 3188.82s]  trump's face on your face just like recorded yourself going let me tell you listen no believe
[3189.38s -> 3198.25s]  every single one of us did that like there's not one person i don't think in the world that
[3198.25s -> 3212.50s]  didn't do that for like 10 minutes only boomers do that that was when face swapping was first
[3212.50s -> 3219.32s]  introduced i've never done that and i don't intend to i i'm just telling you like that's
[3219.32s -> 3237.00s]  what people did yeah many times i put on from game of thrones putting on like different characters
[3237.00s -> 3252.95s]  faces and just doing their monologues snl humor that's me putting like a face on my face i'm not
[3252.95s -> 3258.23s]  sharing this with the public by the way i was just doing it in the comfort of my privacy of my own
[3258.23s -> 3272.22s]  living room you're the one who discovered how that glow happens it's even weirder that is not
[3272.22s -> 3278.41s]  weirder how many of you sing in the shower i want to know how many people's here sing in the shower
[3282.15s -> 3288.79s]  some of you i know at least some of you do actually me me me me me okay is that an
[3288.79s -> 3294.15s]  is that insane are you insane for doing that i don't sing in the shower i do like celebrity
[3294.15s -> 3303.18s]  impressions in the shower what's the difference you are imitating a song that you heard i'm
[3303.18s -> 3318.81s]  imitating a person i've heard how's that different it's the same thing there's a big difference no
[3318.81s -> 3327.05s]  it's not you singing firework in your shower is not is the exact same thing as me just putting
[3327.05s -> 3332.73s]  my hands up looking left and right with the water hitting me in the face going imitate excuse me
[3332.73s -> 3337.13s]  believe me it's the same thing it's the exact same thing it's just you happen to have a tone
[3337.13s -> 3352.95s]  while you're doing it why do you sing in the shower what's it for is armin a celebrity
[3353.51s -> 3365.59s]  i mean kinda yeah i mean is he probably i mean yeah maybe the actor is like an actor i'm imitating
[3365.59s -> 3386.95s]  the i'm imitating an actor okay that's really funny he is he's doing voices while touching
[3386.95s -> 3396.17s]  himself in the shower you can't just add shit onto this missing the plot there's animals you
[3396.17s -> 3408.94s]  take photos of who cares for now enjoy your nighttime outing okay sometimes you wonder
[3408.94s -> 3415.35s]  if i'm a lab experiment what you should be wondering is how did i get out
[3417.67s -> 3430.82s]  at night you might be able to see the illumina phenomenon at the nature park observe your
[3430.82s -> 3438.98s]  surroundings carefully you got there's currently a poll 51 percent of you sing in the shower
[3441.35s -> 3450.57s]  and i'm weird for doing like celebrity impressions in the shower i'm the weird guy but when you are
[3450.57s -> 3458.73s]  singing you are imitating the voice the cadence and the tone of the singer who sings the song
[3460.86s -> 3469.62s]  you're crazy you're the weird sus guy
[3478.58s -> 3483.62s]  uh i i love this this is fun okay here we go we're at night

[3845.16s -> 3859.62s]  it's not that one it's that one look at how good this is it's this one right this one's off center
[3859.62s -> 3870.52s]  but it's closer i'm going with this one it's more intense and then a crystal bloom and then
[3870.52s -> 3878.79s]  did i have one of where's pichu in this photo there is no pichu do i wear a deodorant i do
[3879.67s -> 3890.07s]  i do i do not wear an antiperspirant i wear a deodorant that was good
[3891.67s -> 3908.90s]  placement that's a silver i'll take it uh antiperspirant burns my underarms i gotta be
[3908.90s -> 3916.17s]  honest i will put on a deodorant with antiperspirant in it and six hours later
[3916.17s -> 3931.24s]  it will be just red marks under my arms it's a diamond photo all right that's pretty good
[3931.96s -> 3946.38s]  you might be allergic to aluminum that's interesting that means it's working yeah
[3946.38s -> 3954.41s]  you really it's only gonna burn your skin for you to know it's working that's a good photo
[3955.05s -> 3966.65s]  yeah a lot of uh antiperspirants use aluminum dioxide yeah that doesn't sound good four stars
[3966.65s -> 3977.06s]  but it's bronze oh well that's the first four star um i'm just painting can't sweat if your
[3977.06s -> 3992.79s]  skin has melted off um is that true discovery no deodorant's fine deodorant just makes it so
[3992.79s -> 4008.76s]  you don't smell it just like makes you smell nice an antiperspirant and here's the thing
[4008.76s -> 4013.16s]  about antiperspirant i'm about to let you guys in on a very very very strong held not a secret
[4013.16s -> 4017.32s]  this is literally you can just google this in five seconds figure this out um if you wear
[4017.40s -> 4025.86s]  antiperspirant it makes you sweat more in my case i used to put this on i would put on just like a
[4025.86s -> 4031.62s]  standard just deodorant antiperspirant and i would just i would be soaking through my shirt and my
[4031.62s -> 4043.88s]  underarms since i have stopped wearing this is this is absolutely true this is completely true
[4044.82s -> 4052.10s]  since i have stopped using an antiperspirant over time i don't have you guys remember how i
[4052.10s -> 4059.03s]  lift up my shirt and i'd be like oh sweat check yeah i don't have like big wet marks on my arms
[4059.03s -> 4077.46s]  anymore your nose blind i'm not sweat check sweat check like you want to prove it all right
[4078.26s -> 4086.33s]  clean wait i don't want you to see that far in my arm clean look this is clean this is clean
[4086.97s -> 4108.49s]  i mean there's a little fuck my career is over oh no i hate it i'm so pissed i really thought
[4108.49s -> 4115.05s]  there was nothing there what do you remember how huge it was before you remember how gigantic it
[4115.05s -> 4123.06s]  was and remember listen wait wait wait wait wait wait i this is las vegas nevada okay it's very
[4123.06s -> 4127.54s]  hot here even with like air conditioning i'm sitting down getting really heated streaming
[4127.54s -> 4133.46s]  in like a hot streamer room this is that's that's you should you should have seen how it was like
[4133.46s -> 4139.70s]  a few years ago do you remember how fucking revolting it was it was revolting three or four
[4139.70s -> 4144.26s]  years ago i would lift it up it would be like somebody it was a joke like somebody poured water
[4144.26s -> 4168.78s]  on me i i want to know how good this one is that's okay good that's diamond it looks sad i don't like
[4168.78s -> 4188.60s]  this picture maybe you just have a better diet no i don't think so it's because i was wearing
[4189.16s -> 4209.03s]  i don't wear it anymore i just wear like a gentle deodorant it was the mayo sweats all right level
[4209.03s -> 4227.91s]  one going on to level two almost perky sweats your sweat backing up is causing your back pain
[4228.79s -> 4240.20s]  what if that would be that would be quite a discovery okay uh crystal bloom by the way
[4240.20s -> 4242.52s]  thanks to the progress you've made in your research i've got something to report
[4243.24s -> 4246.76s]  i'll fill you in once your photos are squared away i think you'll be pleased to hear this
[4248.57s -> 4258.65s]  i don't want to save any of this sponsored viewer this game is awesome pogchamp you can save your
[4258.65s -> 4275.19s]  photos to the nintendo switch album no what is this something in credit what's what happened
[4275.19s -> 4286.81s]  that looks bad here's the thing what's the point of that cutscene it's like was just animated and
[4286.81s -> 4293.48s]  like cg and stuff when you get near that field of flowers i picked up an incredibly strong energy
[4293.48s -> 4299.91s]  reading also its source seemed to be moving too if only slightly which suggests that we've
[4299.91s -> 4310.15s]  got here is an illumina pokemon we can't be sure yet but i suspect so i wonder why it showed up
[4310.15s -> 4316.87s]  did you do anything special i also doubt that it appeared when it did by chance but i think you
[4316.87s -> 4322.33s]  should be the one to investigate the area where that reading is coming from oh i want to go see
[4323.29s -> 4328.90s]  you can watch the monitor with me it's gonna be real dangerous it's gonna be full of radiation
[4328.90s -> 4346.20s]  why do you think we're sending the fucking new guy anyways kid have fun sending a kid
[4346.92s -> 4357.70s]  all right let's find the illumina animal here we go this is a boss this is a i have to say good
[4357.78s -> 4358.58s]  photos of the boss
[4374.76s -> 4377.94s]  quiet too quiet
[4387.38s -> 4401.61s]  look at the camera at the camera are you dumb this is a fucking weird land before time
[4401.61s -> 4427.30s]  brontosaurus kid take the photo hurry all right scan it don't take a picture of his ass
[4427.30s -> 4449.80s]  wait what am i scanning i need a good picture of him wait is he eating he's eating oh where's
[4449.80s -> 4475.37s]  this i don't know what i'm supposed to be scanning what do i what am i supposed to do with him i
[4475.37s -> 4491.21s]  don't know we're gonna make a big collage these photos suck wait i don't know it's what's one
[4491.21s -> 4508.66s]  took good get him running scan hold x there's something i can scan somewhere you're gonna do
[4508.66s -> 4529.83s]  anything oh how is he bad at this what are you talking about i took stop zooming it said get
[4529.83s -> 4536.86s]  them big the number one thing that professor oak told me to do was make sure they're huge in the
[4536.86s -> 4557.62s]  frame we got a lot to discuss let's go get your photos evaluated okay what's a good one none of
[4557.62s -> 4570.68s]  these are usable okay i guess that none of those are usable oh is that not usable that's awesome
[4571.40s -> 4584.97s]  look he's like doing a big sniff okay hold on look at how good that is what the fuck these are
[4584.97s -> 4603.26s]  perfect what what the hell why can i use any of these what read what do you mean read
[4604.22s -> 4620.68s]  i need to scan him this this is like uh this is an emote what emote is that
[4624.95s -> 4635.08s]  oh these are all not good it has to be when he's glowing my dog makes that face all the time
[4639.70s -> 4650.89s]  okay well which one of these is the best i mean probably that one i think i have to use the emote
[4650.89s -> 4678.14s]  okay it's meganium size pose is great size is great direction is great placements great
[4678.14s -> 4700.22s]  that's diamond i got it i don't need to come back and do this ever again level two got it look at
[4700.22s -> 4705.48s]  that you've had a new stage in your research keep an eye out for changes so i have to go back there
[4705.48s -> 4718.52s]  and take a picture when the animal does something different and does a new pose you need to go take
[4718.52s -> 4726.39s]  a pee and play pac-man no i'm not doing that yet i'm i'm playing this i like this i'm invested
[4726.39s -> 4735.77s]  for the time being everybody hate pokemon all of a sudden everybody hates pokemon i thought this is
[4735.77s -> 4764.71s]  like everyone's favorite fucking franchise well i need that one i need this all right massive blur
[4773.43s -> 4807.16s]  go right there okay why haven't you a bit unusual good okay cool let's go i got a new filter
[4807.16s -> 4823.58s]  wait new filter literally new filter literally we like attack on titan boomer keep doing arman's
[4823.58s -> 4829.40s]  voice you don't think i like it that was amazing wasn't it gorgeous wasn't it huge and it was saying
[4829.40s -> 4836.79s]  something easy there read it take a deep breath who's talking you were practically dancing professor
[4838.17s -> 4846.28s]  ahem moving on there's no doubt about it that meganium was an illumina pokemon they all
[4846.28s -> 4856.84s]  fucking weird names like i illumina is it illumina illumina it's not illumina it's illumina
[4857.56s -> 4874.84s]  it's an illumina pokemon bright animal done illiterate andy sounded out illumina illumina
[4874.84s -> 4884.47s]  pokemon that's too much that's too much to say illumina pokemon illumina pokemon that's seven
[4884.47s -> 4896.34s]  syllables to get to get across literally bright dog bright dino i just made it so much easier for
[4896.34s -> 4915.08s]  you aluminum aluminum illumina it's illumina illumination illumination i'm sorry let me do
[4915.08s -> 4928.25s]  that better illumination they have distinctive patterns and to glow with unusual light minion
[4928.25s -> 4934.23s]  voice you're done what do you mean i'm done i'm done what do you mean i'm done
[4938.41s -> 4950.22s]  minion voice you're done it's over for you oh shit i see you go biart career over
[4951.02s -> 4956.36s]  all right let's pick up this conversation from here tomorrow
[4963.62s -> 4969.69s]  i really thought this is a career ending stream i thought that like my fly was down and that like
[4969.69s -> 4978.17s]  i was in deep deep shit there's probably a frame grab you could take of me looking down and having
[4978.17s -> 4985.54s]  like that half second of like panic on camera you could it's i stream at 60 fps you could probably
[4985.54s -> 4996.74s]  find one frame where it's just like oh my god he thinks he's naked i've been preparing to launch
[4996.74s -> 5004.34s]  an ecological survey spanning the entire lentil region no sooner had you arrived than we suddenly
[5004.34s -> 5012.26s]  found in right dog i think there's a connection professor i can't be sure yet but fascinating
[5012.26s -> 5020.12s]  things are bound to happen if you come with us really oh you know maybe for a scientist
[5020.12s -> 5030.46s]  you sure can be vague sometimes professional i think it's a good idea i'll be way more fun
[5031.02s -> 5037.42s]  it'll be way more fun with you along right ready to officially join our research team
[5037.42s -> 5049.98s]  wait i haven't been on the team the whole time i accept let's make it official
[5063.77s -> 5068.17s]  it's like you were born to wear it we're waiting for adventure awaits
[5069.29s -> 5074.33s]  terrain on your parade frida but i need to get a couple more things ready first
[5074.97s -> 5081.21s]  oh come on just a little bit longer all right i promise it'll be worth the wait right i'll explain
[5081.21s -> 5093.70s]  next time you're headed out to do some research sounded like deku from my hero academia you did
[5095.99s -> 5100.39s]  oh it's really wild well i wonder who's gonna win this tournament is that that's not no it's not
[5100.95s -> 5112.22s]  you officially joined the lentil region officially joined the lentil region research team
[5116.02s -> 5125.59s]  all right let's go i'm talking about anime you guys are talking about it i just said
[5125.59s -> 5130.38s]  literally one word now that you're a full-fledged team member i have something for you that'll come
[5130.38s -> 5144.04s]  in handy food on your trips enough feeding me these guys get one apple oh by the way
[5144.04s -> 5150.90s]  i forgot i haven't been feeding either of you here's an apple it's been four days is just me
[5150.90s -> 5156.01s]  or have you been getting me to do a lot more of the work lately professor well time to explain
[5156.01s -> 5161.19s]  like the great assistant i am he's gone what happened to him what happened to him is he all
[5161.19s -> 5170.81s]  right this is a this is a fluff fruit they grow here it's an apple why can't you just say apple
[5171.37s -> 5177.24s]  this is my problem with this whole universe why can't you just say apple this is a fluff fruit
[5178.18s -> 5182.28s]  they grow here in the lentil region they're sweet and tasty it's like they're like afraid to get
[5182.28s -> 5188.58s]  copyright infringement on apple and like pears and grapes and stuff i don't understand they're
[5188.58s -> 5193.54s]  sweet and tasty and they make a great snack for a pokemon they may look just like regular apples
[5194.18s -> 5201.37s]  but they're way lighter and softer oh so oh so they're a macintosh my favorite you probably
[5201.37s -> 5214.52s]  make a pokemon's day if you toss it one of these let's get you some practice macintosh is the best
[5214.52s -> 5218.62s]  yes it is
[5219.90s -> 5233.74s]  okay they like them i can aim it
[5244.25s -> 5248.81s]  oh i'm going for it i'm going for a skull why is it the first thing i want to do

[5270.31s -> 5271.35s]  i didn't kill him he's alive
[5275.11s -> 5284.74s]  i'm just getting hit with an like an apple that would suck those things are they're dense and
[5284.74s -> 5298.14s]  they're kind of heavy you should try testing out fluff root and taking some more photos in the
[5298.14s -> 5304.57s]  meantime professor says there are all kinds of ways to use it finished explaining ic thanks
[5304.57s -> 5309.53s]  frito we've got one more thing to tell you about you never know what's going to happen in
[5309.53s -> 5314.81s]  imaginopolis so if you ever need any help just click me here we go

[6040.31s -> 6046.79s]  i like how he reads comments but doesn't process what they say at all and then proceeds to not
[6046.79s -> 6053.00s]  understand welcome to every single day of my life in high school like does reading comprehension i
[6053.00s -> 6060.52s]  would just read and i could read very well but the text every paragraph i would go down the
[6060.52s -> 6066.94s]  paragraph before it was invisible ink and would just disappear i would only be able to comprehend
[6066.94s -> 6072.78s]  like the current like one paragraph i was in and it just it was disappearing the book was

[7004.19s -> 7010.92s]  Hey, I got to, we got to get an apple here.
[7010.92s -> 7031.24s]  Erin, it was rude.
[7031.24s -> 7036.29s]  What?
[7037.85s -> 7040.48s]  Ooh, this is cute.
[7040.48s -> 7041.62s]  This is very cute.
[7041.62s -> 7048.53s]  I don't, I don't want to, I don't want to wake him up.
[7048.53s -> 7051.07s]  It's cool, this is very cute.
[7051.07s -> 7058.28s]  I mean like super cute.
[7058.28s -> 7065.57s]  Got it.
[7065.57s -> 7067.55s]  Zooming Andy.
[7067.55s -> 7077.38s]  Yes, I want my subjects to be in frame.
[7077.38s -> 7083.90s]  What we got?
[7084.02s -> 7086.31s]  One star.
[7086.31s -> 7092.95s]  And that's a better picture, you can see everything.
[7092.95s -> 7096.62s]  All right, which one of these is the best?
[7096.62s -> 7100.13s]  Probably one of these.
[7100.13s -> 7101.90s]  I like that one.
[7101.90s -> 7105.64s]  Or this one, he's on the ground just creeping.
[7105.64s -> 7107.44s]  I like that one too, he's thinking.
[7107.44s -> 7108.92s]  We need to have one star.
[7108.92s -> 7120.02s]  We'll do this one, that one.
[7120.02s -> 7124.55s]  First one I have is much better.
[7124.55s -> 7129.50s]  All right, where's the yawning one?
[7129.50s -> 7132.46s]  That's yawning, that's yawning, right?
[7135.10s -> 7136.54s]  I love that one.
[7136.54s -> 7137.70s]  This is him yawning.
[7137.70s -> 7147.13s]  I need this one.
[7147.13s -> 7149.13s]  Let's get it in the, get it in the book.
[7155.78s -> 7160.00s]  I don't know, should I do?
[7160.00s -> 7169.90s]  Probably, probably one?
[7169.90s -> 7172.90s]  Hey, that's, is this one better than the other one?
[7172.90s -> 7175.22s]  Probably not.
[7175.22s -> 7190.05s]  I need a two star, that one's fine.
[7190.05s -> 7192.23s]  This is a really good picture, come on.
[7192.23s -> 7194.27s]  His eyes, placement.
[7194.27s -> 7199.03s]  Yeah, there it is.
[7199.03s -> 7199.87s]  He's pogging.
[7204.28s -> 7208.17s]  I feel like this is probably a better photo.
[7208.17s -> 7209.38s]  No?
[7209.38s -> 7211.24s]  No, I guess not.
[7211.24s -> 7212.80s]  I think that's much better.
[7212.80s -> 7222.29s]  It's his eyes and face.
[7222.29s -> 7227.46s]  Oh, that's it.
[7228.14s -> 7233.38s]  Is there a Caterpie in this video?
[7233.38s -> 7237.87s]  Apparently there is.
[7237.87s -> 7244.81s]  All right, this is the big ticket item here.
[7244.81s -> 7251.80s]  That's a golden, four star diamond.
[7251.80s -> 7257.62s]  Ain't gonna find a photo like that ever again.
[7257.62s -> 7261.75s]  Place it in there.
[7261.75s -> 7267.11s]  I like this hoot hoot photo.
[7267.11s -> 7268.71s]  Bold, mm-hmm.
[7270.97s -> 7277.52s]  Just gotta get it in the book.
[7277.52s -> 7279.52s]  Digimon digital monsters.
[7279.52s -> 7284.70s]  Digimon digital monsters, digital monsters.
[7284.70s -> 7290.46s]  Research level two.
[7290.46s -> 7291.86s]  I thought they were animals.
[7292.54s -> 7300.34s]  They are.
[7300.34s -> 7301.18s]  Okay, what are the,
[7301.18s -> 7307.06s]  I have to go back to the boss monster thing.
[7307.06s -> 7309.10s]  The love of entertainment stopped zooming in.
[7309.10s -> 7311.46s]  No, I'm gonna, look, I'm gonna take my photos away.
[7311.46s -> 7312.30s]  I'm gonna take them.
[7312.30s -> 7321.80s]  And they're good.
[7321.80s -> 7323.60s]  Wait, is that, that looks like a dog?
[7327.92s -> 7328.96s]  That was a regular dog.
[7328.96s -> 7337.17s]  I told you it was a dog.
[7337.17s -> 7339.82s]  This is Todd.
[7339.82s -> 7342.34s]  He's a professional Pokemon photographer.
[7342.34s -> 7345.99s]  His work takes him all over the world.
[7345.99s -> 7347.43s]  Are you the one they caught?
[7347.43s -> 7349.59s]  Hey, bright dog on camera, way to go.
[7349.59s -> 7352.43s]  That's a big deal.
[7352.43s -> 7354.63s]  Todd, did you bring what I asked you to?
[7354.63s -> 7356.17s]  Sure did.
[7356.17s -> 7357.17s]  You're a lifesaver.
[7357.17s -> 7360.94s]  Now we'll finally be able to set out.
[7360.94s -> 7363.30s]  Is this guy a friend of yours, Professor?
[7363.30s -> 7366.71s]  An old travel companion, to be precise.
[7366.71s -> 7370.81s]  He's been helping me plan our big survey of Lentil too.
[7370.81s -> 7373.61s]  No kidding.
[7373.61s -> 7375.45s]  Oh, is that the new pod you put together?
[7375.45s -> 7378.62s]  Reminds me of the good old days.
[7378.62s -> 7384.05s]  But hey, let me see those Illumina Pokemon photos.
[7394.91s -> 7396.79s]  A kid, get your own mentor.
[7396.79s -> 7407.22s]  What the fuck is this?
[7407.22s -> 7409.38s]  So you're the new teammate, huh?
[7409.38s -> 7412.42s]  I'm Phil, Todd's number one student.
[7412.42s -> 7415.18s]  Easy there, Phil.
[7415.18s -> 7418.42s]  I'm tempted to take part in this big ecological survey
[7418.42s -> 7422.07s]  myself, but I have another idea.
[7422.07s -> 7425.86s]  How about I send Phil with you instead?
[7425.86s -> 7429.34s]  I'm fine with that if you are, Todd.
[7429.34s -> 7431.38s]  Yes, awesome.
[7431.38s -> 7433.78s]  You can be my stand-in for now.
[7433.78s -> 7437.95s]  But don't forget, I'll need that badge back eventually.
[7437.99s -> 7440.23s]  Well, fine, but if I take a super cool photo,
[7440.23s -> 7443.30s]  I get to keep the badge.
[7443.30s -> 7445.06s]  Please stop this shit, Todd voice.
[7445.06s -> 7447.31s]  Why, does it make you, you don't like it?
[7447.31s -> 7452.65s]  Making you feel a certain way?
[7452.65s -> 7454.33s]  That's what he sounds like.
[7454.33s -> 7459.90s]  That's what he sounds like.
[7459.90s -> 7460.98s]  What is that?
[7463.44s -> 7466.10s]  I don't know, I thought that was chin armor.
[7466.10s -> 7480.85s]  I thought he was wearing a fucking necklace.
[7480.85s -> 7482.62s]  Ooh, cool.
[7482.62s -> 7483.70s]  That's not, I'm just pretending.
[7483.70s -> 7485.50s]  Okay, I thought it was a new area,
[7485.50s -> 7487.30s]  but it's our camp and I wasn't paying attention,
[7487.30s -> 7488.34s]  so I just wanted to make you think
[7488.34s -> 7490.14s]  that I thought it was cool.
[7490.14s -> 7491.66s]  Is that I wasn't paying any attention.
[7491.66s -> 7498.32s]  They're talking about this is where we are right now.
[7498.32s -> 7499.48s]  This would be our first destination.
[7499.48s -> 7502.22s]  Ooh.
[7504.34s -> 7506.50s]  Why are we starting there?
[7506.50s -> 7509.14s]  I've detected a spot there with high energy readings.
[7509.14s -> 7513.78s]  The Neo One should be able to teleport to it.
[7513.78s -> 7517.30s]  This island showed up in the travel log, right?
[7517.30s -> 7518.42s]  Certainly did.
[7518.42s -> 7521.06s]  Captain Vince wrote that he saw a glowing Pokemon
[7521.06s -> 7523.60s]  there too, in fact.
[7523.60s -> 7526.74s]  Come on already, let's get this survey started.
[7526.74s -> 7528.26s]  Fair enough.
[7528.26s -> 7530.26s]  Enjoy your first in a century adventure
[7530.26s -> 7537.36s]  into the wilds of Lental.
[7537.36s -> 7538.88s]  All right, what else?
[7538.88s -> 7540.92s]  Hoot Hoot's hidden foot.
[7540.92s -> 7542.92s]  Have you ever seen Hoot Hoot's other foot?
[7542.92s -> 7553.22s]  You should try to get a photo of it.
[7553.22s -> 7554.06s]  Not now.
[7554.06s -> 7557.42s]  New area unlocked.
[7557.42s -> 7558.78s]  Don't make a Warcraft reference.
[7558.78s -> 7561.10s]  Don't make a, do not make a Warcraft reference.
[7561.10s -> 7565.10s]  Do not say, open up your M in World of Warcraft
[7565.10s -> 7568.91s]  and right click, right click, right click, right click.
[7568.91s -> 7570.83s]  You have to right click like six times
[7570.83s -> 7573.91s]  to see the world in World of Warcraft.
[7573.91s -> 7576.39s]  It's like zones inside of zones, inside of zones,
[7576.39s -> 7580.30s]  inside of countries, inside of countries now.
[7580.30s -> 7593.34s]  I'm, look, I'm a Warcraft streamer.
[7593.34s -> 7597.81s]  I've already talked about this.
[7597.81s -> 7600.33s]  It doesn't matter that I've not played WoW
[7600.33s -> 7603.50s]  in a very, very long time.
[7603.50s -> 7608.10s]  All that matters is I dedicated like two plus years
[7608.10s -> 7610.46s]  in front of the screen.
[7610.46s -> 7614.71s]  Like 500 days played in WoW.
[7614.71s -> 7624.82s]  It's part of my life, like permanently.
[7624.82s -> 7631.13s]  We got, we got, they have faces?
[7631.13s -> 7632.97s]  I don't know.
[7632.97s -> 7646.34s]  Whoa, there's a Woody the Woodpecker.
[7646.34s -> 7647.66s]  Whoa, what is that guy?
[7648.86s -> 7650.10s]  That's Peter Griffin.
[7650.10s -> 7653.17s]  That's, hey!
[7653.17s -> 7654.45s]  That's Peter Griffin in a costume.
[7654.45s -> 7669.81s]  That's, I don't, it is.
[7669.81s -> 7671.96s]  Animal up there?
[7671.96s -> 7673.98s]  I'm gonna scan.
[7673.98s -> 7675.62s]  Crystal Bloom, a crystal bloom that grows
[7675.62s -> 7682.34s]  on Bilselvia Island.
[7682.34s -> 7686.71s]  What are you gonna do?
[7686.71s -> 7696.21s]  What are you gonna do?
[7696.21s -> 7703.49s]  Throw shit at him.
[7703.49s -> 7711.59s]  That also could be Peter Griffin in a costume.
[7711.59s -> 7715.54s]  That's my favorite Pokemon.
[7715.54s -> 7717.10s]  His name's Quagmire.
[7717.10s -> 7718.66s]  This is my favorite Pokemon.
[7718.66s -> 7720.10s]  Is this one cool?
[7720.10s -> 7720.94s]  I like this one.
[7720.94s -> 7734.01s]  That's actually my favorite Pokemon.
[7734.01s -> 7740.46s]  Ah, eggs.
[7740.46s -> 7751.09s]  Ready to come eat those eggs.
[7751.09s -> 7752.21s]  That wasn't even a good picture.
[7752.21s -> 7759.08s]  That was terrible.
[7759.08s -> 7762.70s]  Where is it?
[7762.70s -> 7764.30s]  These ancient ruins are being engulfed
[7764.30s -> 7768.19s]  by an enormous tree.
[7768.19s -> 7775.50s]  Shit.
[7775.50s -> 7782.27s]  I like this zone, this zone's cool.
[7782.27s -> 7784.09s]  Into the water?
[7784.09s -> 7786.37s]  This is gonna be like a, a, a, a, a,
[7786.37s -> 7787.49s]  this is gonna, whatever.
[7788.01s -> 7792.42s]  This is gonna be something in here.
[7792.42s -> 7793.62s]  Come on, go for it.
[7793.62s -> 7802.48s]  He's right there.
[7802.48s -> 7806.02s]  I get it.
[7806.02s -> 7806.86s]  Jump out of the water.
[7806.86s -> 7810.44s]  Whoa, you're asleep.
[7810.44s -> 7820.62s]  Oh shit, I didn't even look.
[7820.62s -> 7824.68s]  Missed the yawn.
[7824.68s -> 7829.36s]  That was a cool cat.
[7829.36s -> 7832.78s]  Those are french fries.
[7832.78s -> 7835.66s]  Ha ha ha ha.
[7835.66s -> 7842.82s]  Good picture, I liked it.
[7842.82s -> 7851.46s]  Anybody want any fruits?
[7851.46s -> 7859.70s]  That Pokemon is the definition of a no thoughts head empty.
[7859.70s -> 7861.42s]  They do just kind of sit there with their mouths open,
[7861.42s -> 7862.94s]  don't they?
[7862.94s -> 7867.99s]  You like apples?
[7867.99s -> 7871.20s]  Don't like apples.
[7871.20s -> 7876.06s]  Ha ha ha.
[7876.06s -> 7890.02s]  Come on, give me something through the trees here.
[7890.02s -> 7892.61s]  Oh well.
[7892.61s -> 7902.56s]  Shit, come on, really?
[7902.56s -> 7904.34s]  What is that emote?
[7904.34s -> 7906.92s]  What is that?
[7906.92s -> 7914.82s]  Like a pizza, it's a Megalo pizza?
[7914.82s -> 7922.43s]  What is that?
[7922.43s -> 7927.26s]  It's the only one I have, so take it.
[7927.26s -> 7930.19s]  I mean, that's just better.
[7930.19s -> 7933.21s]  Which one of these is the best?
[7933.21s -> 7937.49s]  Probably this one.
[7937.49s -> 7940.09s]  Aw.
[7940.09s -> 7941.74s]  Ha ha ha.
[7941.74s -> 7945.10s]  Wait, this one has another Pokemon in it though.
[7945.14s -> 7951.80s]  There's probably more points.
[7951.80s -> 7957.62s]  Aw, it's probably that one.
[7957.62s -> 7961.21s]  Yeah, that one.
[7961.21s -> 7967.68s]  That one, nope, that one.
[7967.68s -> 7970.67s]  Should I go for the four star?
[7970.67s -> 7978.93s]  I think so, if I have an opportunity, why not?
[7978.93s -> 7982.21s]  It's good to me.
[7982.21s -> 7984.21s]  One stars are easy to forget, that's true.
[7993.99s -> 8000.37s]  Yeah, it's gonna be dog shit, I know, it don't matter.
[8000.37s -> 8002.87s]  Why am I still playing this?
[8002.87s -> 8011.71s]  Well, it's a very simple answer for you.
[8011.71s -> 8023.79s]  Because I'm having fun.
[8023.79s -> 8027.54s]  Stop having fun, I'm not allowed.
[8027.54s -> 8031.54s]  I'm having fun!
[8031.54s -> 8032.38s]  Who cares?
[8032.38s -> 8033.46s]  You need to entertain us.
[8033.46s -> 8050.97s]  I'm having fun, and I'm having fun.
[8050.97s -> 8052.65s]  Jatt hates games.
[8052.65s -> 8057.08s]  Ha ha ha.
[8057.08s -> 8058.32s]  I have, okay.
[8058.32s -> 8061.52s]  Is there a game that collectively everybody here liked?
[8061.52s -> 8064.45s]  I don't know if it's, I don't think so.
[8064.45s -> 8065.77s]  Has there ever been a video game
[8065.77s -> 8071.34s]  that everyone here collectively actually enjoyed?
[8071.34s -> 8077.81s]  I'm not sure it's ever happened.
[8077.81s -> 8079.96s]  Simpsons Hit and Run?
[8079.96s -> 8082.36s]  I don't think anybody liked that particular game
[8082.36s -> 8087.99s]  as much as they liked people being angry at it.
[8087.99s -> 8088.91s]  House Flipper?
[8088.91s -> 8091.11s]  You know what, that's true.
[8091.11s -> 8093.98s]  House Flipper is the one.
[8093.98s -> 8095.02s]  People saying TF2?
[8095.02s -> 8096.94s]  Yeah, I haven't streamed TF2.
[8099.40s -> 8109.92s]  I think I streamed TF2 like twice, like four years ago.
[8109.92s -> 8111.32s]  I love House Flipper.
[8111.32s -> 8116.20s]  What a great game.
[8116.20s -> 8119.04s]  We all collectively hated Watch Dogs 3.
[8119.04s -> 8121.31s]  Oh yeah, so did I.
[8121.31s -> 8129.03s]  That's probably the worst game I've ever played.
[8129.03s -> 8132.15s]  Wait, can there be a category of worst games
[8132.15s -> 8146.10s]  I've ever played that costed like $100 million to make?
[8146.10s -> 8154.05s]  Ooh, requests, what is it?
[8154.09s -> 8158.97s]  Most expensive disappointments.
[8158.97s -> 8161.39s]  What do we got?
[8161.39s -> 8163.35s]  There's a Pokemon that's nowhere to be seen most of the time,
[8163.35s -> 8165.75s]  but at night it sleeps beside Torterra.
[8165.75s -> 8167.59s]  Can you see if you can find it?
[8167.59s -> 8170.29s]  I already got that one, didn't I?
[8170.29s -> 8175.02s]  An afternoon meal?
[8175.02s -> 8180.85s]  Wait, I have to get a photo of that?
[8180.85s -> 8182.29s]  No, that's just you sending me pictures.
[8182.29s -> 8184.02s]  I don't want them.
[8184.02s -> 8185.54s]  Hard one, happiness.
[8185.54s -> 8187.94s]  Pidgeotto's cool, but it's kind of distant.
[8187.94s -> 8191.31s]  Think it'd warm up to you for a fluff root?
[8191.31s -> 8197.65s]  Okay, did you get a picture of the Hoot Hoot foot?
[8197.65s -> 8199.37s]  And then there's a Pokemon that sleeps in this area.
[8199.41s -> 8201.13s]  Perhaps it would show itself where,
[8201.13s -> 8207.05s]  if there were other Pokemon nearby, okay.
[8207.05s -> 8218.66s]  I want to go to that jungle at night.
[8218.66s -> 8219.62s]  Can I do it at night?
[8219.62s -> 8221.56s]  During the day.
[8221.56s -> 8223.52s]  All right, chow time.
[8223.52s -> 8228.61s]  Making a splash.
[8228.61s -> 8232.11s]  Yeah, I already did that one.
[8232.11s -> 8235.62s]  I'm a beginner, chow time.
[8235.62s -> 8237.62s]  Wait, who is this?
[8237.62s -> 8240.05s]  How am I getting this?
[8240.05s -> 8244.08s]  Oh, this is somebody's picture.
[8244.08s -> 8246.70s]  Oh, that was pretty cool.
[8246.70s -> 8252.37s]  Sweet, make some Reddit gold.
[8252.37s -> 8257.39s]  All right, I got to get a picture of him splashing.
[8257.39s -> 8258.23s]  Report it.
[8258.23s -> 8261.14s]  Why would there be a report function?
[8261.14s -> 8263.59s]  It's on rails.
[8263.59s -> 8276.55s]  What would you possibly be doing to report a photo?
[8276.55s -> 8291.62s]  Okay, zoom, zoom Andy, zoom Andy, zoom Andy, I know.
[8291.62s -> 8303.08s]  Somebody will find a way.
[8303.08s -> 8305.96s]  Zoom.
[8305.96s -> 8309.63s]  Oh, spider, is this a spider?
[8309.63s -> 8314.80s]  Is this a spider Pokemon?
[8314.80s -> 8316.84s]  I need Peter Griffin's attention.
[8316.84s -> 8325.81s]  Get out of the way.
[8325.81s -> 8329.10s]  It didn't work.
[8329.10s -> 8333.00s]  There are like three spider Pokemon, really?
[8333.76s -> 8340.09s]  There's four of them, are there really?
[8340.09s -> 8343.36s]  Wait, what's that?
[8343.36s -> 8344.96s]  Move out of the way, there's something over there.
[8344.96s -> 8348.32s]  Holy shit, it's a snake.
[8348.32s -> 8357.24s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[8357.24s -> 8358.36s]  Whoa, it eats the apples.
[8358.36s -> 8360.08s]  All right, hold on, come over here.
[8360.08s -> 8366.17s]  Do it over here.
[8366.17s -> 8372.96s]  Oh, that's a good one.
[8372.96s -> 8375.26s]  He's huge, he really is.
[8375.26s -> 8381.92s]  Ooh, good pose.
[8381.92s -> 8383.48s]  He posed right for the camera too.
[8383.48s -> 8390.09s]  That's gonna be a good one.
[8390.09s -> 8401.67s]  I need one of these guys jumping into the pool.
[8401.67s -> 8407.58s]  That snake was huge.
[8407.58s -> 8416.00s]  All right, was that guy jump?
[8416.00s -> 8422.62s]  I should have scanned, my own fault.
[8422.62s -> 8423.74s]  Whoa, cool.
[8423.74s -> 8432.08s]  All right, where's the, I need the lake.
[8432.08s -> 8433.48s]  Something over here.
[8433.48s -> 8440.94s]  Something nest over here.
[8440.94s -> 8441.78s]  What does it say?
[8441.78s -> 8451.99s]  Sega does what Nintendon't, right?
[8451.99s -> 8471.73s]  Look over here.
[8471.73s -> 8475.79s]  Sega does what Nintendon't.
[8475.79s -> 8478.47s]  Genesis was fucking absolute dog shit
[8478.47s -> 8481.10s]  compared to the Super Nintendo.
[8481.10s -> 8485.48s]  It was absolute dog shit in comparison.
[8485.48s -> 8486.60s]  Hey guys, hey, hey, hey, it's me.
[8486.60s -> 8488.16s]  It's me, a Sega game.
[8488.16s -> 8493.16s]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[8493.64s -> 8497.18s]  They all sounded like that.
[8497.18s -> 8507.34s]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[8510.00s -> 8512.00s]  Super Nintendo had the cleaner audio
[8512.00s -> 8525.82s]  and audio is half the way.
[8525.82s -> 8532.78s]  What's over there?
[8532.78s -> 8535.87s]  What's my favorite smell?
[8535.87s -> 8537.17s]  I don't know.
[8537.17s -> 8540.54s]  Favorite smell.
[8540.54s -> 8550.97s]  Um, come on, do something.
[8550.97s -> 8558.26s]  Um, favorite smell.
[8558.26s -> 8562.46s]  I'll tell you what my non-favorite smells are.
[8562.46s -> 8563.98s]  Cinnamon apple.
[8563.98s -> 8566.58s]  Cinnamon apple candles.
[8566.58s -> 8571.34s]  Meh.
[8571.34s -> 8573.38s]  Like apple pie candle.
[8573.38s -> 8577.73s]  I don't like it.
[8577.73s -> 8579.37s]  It's perfect, look at that one.
[8579.37s -> 8595.54s]  These both are actually really good.
[8595.54s -> 8598.50s]  It's the size.
[8598.50s -> 8603.88s]  All Walmart candles smell the same.
[8603.88s -> 8606.71s]  Ooh, I like that one.
[8606.71s -> 8611.32s]  That one, I like this one too.
[8611.32s -> 8623.55s]  It's probably that one.
[8623.55s -> 8625.23s]  So cute.
[8625.23s -> 8626.51s]  Yeah, I like that one a lot.
[8626.55s -> 8628.94s]  And this one.
[8628.94s -> 8636.49s]  Perfect.
[8636.49s -> 8640.05s]  And jumping into the water, which is the one that, um,
[8640.05s -> 8641.17s]  is it this one here?
[8641.17s -> 8645.39s]  That's the one he wants, right?
[8645.39s -> 8655.26s]  Or does he want the actual splash?
[8655.26s -> 8656.10s]  Sandalwood?
[8657.02s -> 8659.50s]  I'm gonna do you one up here.
[8659.50s -> 8662.27s]  Oud.
[8662.27s -> 8665.39s]  Oud is one of my favorite scents.
[8665.39s -> 8672.80s]  It was O-U-D, oud.
[8672.80s -> 8676.38s]  If you've never smelled oud before, O-U-D,
[8676.38s -> 8679.54s]  it's so, it's so wonderful.
[8679.54s -> 8691.90s]  It's a wonderful scent.
[8691.90s -> 8693.46s]  Perfume, the perfume,
[8693.50s -> 8694.66s]  I can't even say this.
[8694.66s -> 8697.70s]  The perfume, the perfume you have
[8697.70s -> 8701.58s]  is oud, vanilla, and wood?
[8701.58s -> 8705.70s]  That, you, I mean, that's fantastic.
[8705.70s -> 8709.87s]  I love the smell of wood too.
[8709.87s -> 8712.86s]  I love the smell of wood.
[8712.86s -> 8719.78s]  Not like a tree, like a wooden table.
[8719.78s -> 8723.94s]  All right, there are these dog treats.
[8723.94s -> 8726.94s]  They're these dog bones that they have this,
[8726.94s -> 8728.06s]  they're made out of wood.
[8728.06s -> 8730.40s]  They have this wood smell.
[8730.40s -> 8731.84s]  They smell incredible.
[8731.84s -> 8736.85s]  They smell unbelievable.
[8736.85s -> 8738.93s]  They're like these wood sticks for dogs,
[8738.93s -> 8742.27s]  and I just wanna smell them.
[8742.27s -> 8750.10s]  They smell incredible.
[8750.10s -> 8763.51s]  Better than the last one.
[8763.51s -> 8766.40s]  Good photo, good pose, good size,
[8766.40s -> 8768.00s]  good direction, good placement.
[8768.00s -> 8769.00s]  I'll take a bronze.
[8779.66s -> 8781.34s]  Oh, not savory dog smell.
[8781.34s -> 8782.86s]  I'm talking about, there's a,
[8782.86s -> 8786.85s]  it's like a wooden dog chew thing.
[8786.85s -> 8789.01s]  I don't think it's actually made out of wood.
[8789.01s -> 8792.90s]  It just smells like wood.
[8792.90s -> 8796.80s]  This is weird, fake, chemical wood smell.
[8796.80s -> 8798.94s]  That's a great photo.
[8798.94s -> 8800.54s]  I've got two diamonds for the cat.
[8821.30s -> 8822.70s]  I'm not gonna say it.
[8822.70s -> 8824.14s]  It's fucking insane.
[8824.14s -> 8825.30s]  I can't say it.
[8826.26s -> 8830.53s]  It's ridiculous.
[8830.53s -> 8831.53s]  Which one's better?
[8831.53s -> 8832.37s]  I like this one.
[8841.06s -> 8841.90s]  You sniff.
[8850.22s -> 8852.38s]  You're fucking driving me crazy.
[8860.25s -> 8867.99s]  What do you got to report, Professor Mirror?
[8867.99s -> 8870.94s]  I'm not gonna say it.
[8870.94s -> 8873.10s]  I'm not gonna say it because it's fucked up
[8873.10s -> 8874.58s]  and I'm not going to say it.
[8881.42s -> 8883.82s]  Say it or we leave.
[8883.82s -> 8885.10s]  No, I'm not gonna say it.
[8885.10s -> 8891.78s]  I said the first part and it was something about wood.
[8891.78s -> 8896.77s]  I'm not gonna say the whole thing together.
[8896.77s -> 8897.73s]  Go to the jungle during the night
[8897.73s -> 8905.83s]  and photograph a crystal bloom glowing in the dark.
[8905.83s -> 8907.07s]  Get out of here.
[8912.96s -> 8916.14s]  You imagine like, this is,
[8916.14s -> 8917.30s]  look at this chat right now.
[8917.30s -> 8920.71s]  Look at this chat room.
[8920.71s -> 8923.10s]  What the hell is happening?
[8923.10s -> 8927.02s]  You guys are gonna get me in trouble.
[8927.02s -> 8928.30s]  No, I'm not, I'm not imagining.
[8928.98s -> 8931.38s]  I'm stop saying that.
[8931.38s -> 8933.22s]  I need to get this out of here.
[8933.22s -> 8934.06s]  I gotta get it out of here.
[8934.06s -> 8935.62s]  Okay, what do I say?
[8935.62s -> 8940.98s]  Shpee or coffee, Cheetos, chicken, shpee, shpee.
[8942.36s -> 8952.09s]  Get it out, get it out, get it out.
[8952.09s -> 8956.79s]  Probably the type we're after.
[8956.79s -> 8962.09s]  We'll call it the bright state.
[8962.09s -> 8964.46s]  Do we need to do anything special if we find one?
[8964.46s -> 8967.06s]  Not particularly, just snap a photo of it.
[8967.06s -> 8971.98s]  Your camera can analyze it for you.
[8971.98s -> 8978.42s]  Enjoy the nighttime jungle.
[8978.50s -> 8982.65s]  Ron.
[8982.65s -> 8984.29s]  In the comfort and safety of its own territory,
[8984.29s -> 8987.01s]  even the warriest Pokemon will let its guard down
[8987.01s -> 8989.37s]  to eat a tasty fruit.
[8989.37s -> 8994.90s]  Wow.
[8994.90s -> 8996.06s]  Oh, cool.
[8996.06s -> 9001.00s]  Whoa, how'd you get that?
[9001.00s -> 9006.94s]  I am so pro gamer.
[9006.94s -> 9013.89s]  I took this photo.
[9013.89s -> 9017.61s]  How'd you get that?
[9017.61s -> 9018.53s]  How'd you do this?
[9036.48s -> 9038.88s]  Okay, what are we doing at night?
[9038.88s -> 9039.72s]  I don't know.
[9051.32s -> 9052.48s]  So fucked up.
[9054.70s -> 9068.79s]  Shit, that was awful.
[9068.79s -> 9070.47s]  We're glowing?
[9070.47s -> 9075.24s]  Where's the bloom?
[9075.24s -> 9077.38s]  We, you started it.
[9077.38s -> 9078.46s]  I did not start it.
[9078.46s -> 9082.26s]  I just told you that I like the smell of my dog's toys.
[9084.18s -> 9089.30s]  I like the smell of my dog's wooden toy.
[9089.30s -> 9091.14s]  He has a toy that's wooden.
[9091.14s -> 9092.42s]  It smells like wood.
[9092.42s -> 9097.26s]  I hate this.
[9097.26s -> 9109.89s]  My dog has a toy.
[9109.89s -> 9111.65s]  It's a stick.
[9111.65s -> 9115.05s]  It came in a package and you open up the package
[9115.05s -> 9117.73s]  and it's made out of like tree, like wood.
[9117.73s -> 9118.57s]  It's wood.
[9118.57s -> 9121.70s]  There's the spider.
[9121.70s -> 9129.82s]  Spider's like apples.
[9129.82s -> 9132.35s]  Get a photo of a crystal bloom, right?
[9132.35s -> 9137.11s]  That's a crystal bloom right there.
[9137.11s -> 9155.19s]  Oh, oh, it has to be glowing.
[9155.19s -> 9165.02s]  Cute, snoozing in the tree.
[9165.02s -> 9172.00s]  It's like an invader's zim.
[9172.00s -> 9180.16s]  Turn and look, turn and look, oh.
[9180.16s -> 9181.00s]  He eat apples?
[9181.00s -> 9184.02s]  Oh, he's eating.
[9184.02s -> 9185.98s]  Show the toy, show the toy.
[9185.98s -> 9197.59s]  I will, I will show it.
[9198.23s -> 9206.14s]  I need a glowing crystal.
[9206.14s -> 9212.15s]  Wrong button.
[9212.15s -> 9215.17s]  Ooh, that's cool.
[9215.17s -> 9222.92s]  Can I get them to move?
[9222.92s -> 9228.95s]  That was cute.
[9228.95s -> 9234.24s]  Pato, oh, Pato, oh, there's Pato.
[9234.24s -> 9236.66s]  I was not even paying attention.
[9236.66s -> 9245.15s]  Could have got a cool action photo.
[9245.15s -> 9253.02s]  All right, crystal.
[9253.02s -> 9259.59s]  I hear something flapping, something flapping.
[9259.59s -> 9262.41s]  Good photo.
[9262.41s -> 9263.89s]  Oh, there's this one.
[9263.89s -> 9266.38s]  All right, throw an apple at it.
[9266.38s -> 9272.86s]  That didn't do anything.
[9272.86s -> 9284.86s]  Wow, wow, wow.
[9284.86s -> 9286.60s]  That's not doing anything.
[9288.12s -> 9289.52s]  Is there one glowing over here?
[9289.52s -> 9294.02s]  There's one glowing over there.
[9294.02s -> 9295.65s]  Move out of the way.
[9295.65s -> 9306.80s]  Move out of the way, move out of the way.
[9306.80s -> 9317.93s]  I want to go in his mouth with a photo.
[9317.93s -> 9321.88s]  Turn, you guys like apples?
[9321.88s -> 9334.85s]  You like apples?
[9334.85s -> 9341.32s]  One of those will work.
[9341.32s -> 9343.48s]  Just make the armpit fart noise already.
[9343.48s -> 9347.43s]  All right, fine.
[9347.43s -> 9364.58s]  That hurt, I can't do it.
[9364.58s -> 9367.72s]  I already have one of these, this one's way worse.
[9367.72s -> 9369.24s]  Do I have any, did you hear my mouth?
[9369.24s -> 9371.34s]  It was like.
[9371.34s -> 9374.17s]  Nothing's gonna compare with that one.
[9374.17s -> 9377.59s]  I mean, the sleeping one's cool, but no.
[9377.59s -> 9383.86s]  All right, this is four in the same shot.
[9383.86s -> 9387.26s]  That's probably what they want.
[9387.26s -> 9391.71s]  This is cuter, but this one is probably more points.
[9391.71s -> 9402.81s]  All right, I don't have any pictures of this.
[9402.81s -> 9407.02s]  That one's good.
[9407.02s -> 9412.06s]  This is a picture of him.
[9412.06s -> 9415.18s]  Oh, that one's cute.
[9415.18s -> 9416.89s]  I like this one.
[9416.89s -> 9423.22s]  Looks like he's balancing it on his nose.
[9423.22s -> 9427.74s]  It's this one.
[9427.74s -> 9431.13s]  I got a couple of really good ones here.
[9431.13s -> 9436.72s]  That one, that one, that one.
[9436.72s -> 9440.68s]  I'm gonna go with this one.
[9440.68s -> 9455.10s]  And a still bloom, glowing, got it.
[9455.18s -> 9457.56s]  Graphics kinda suck.
[9457.56s -> 9460.99s]  Um, I mean, it's the switch though.
[9463.84s -> 9465.44s]  Guys, don't you know,
[9465.44s -> 9468.32s]  Nintendo still bases their graphical power
[9468.32s -> 9471.20s]  on being like two and a half times more powerful
[9471.20s -> 9480.01s]  than the GameCube.
[9480.01s -> 9491.94s]  That's a good picture.
[9491.94s -> 9495.56s]  It looks better than sword and shield.
[9495.56s -> 9499.08s]  People didn't like that, did they?
[9499.08s -> 9500.96s]  I've not heard very good things about that.
[9500.96s -> 9505.14s]  I heard people really didn't like it.
[9505.14s -> 9505.98s]  All right, this is the big one here.
[9505.98s -> 9511.48s]  This is gonna be, that's gonna be gold or diamond.
[9511.84s -> 9513.04s]  Oh, silver.
[9517.02s -> 9521.62s]  Every gen past three is shit.
[9521.62s -> 9526.35s]  I don't even know what gen three is.
[9526.35s -> 9529.07s]  All I know is that I got Pokemon Diamond
[9529.07s -> 9530.87s]  for the Nintendo DS.
[9530.87s -> 9533.19s]  I don't know why it came out
[9533.19s -> 9534.51s]  and I just, for some reason, bought it.
[9534.51s -> 9538.42s]  I'd never played a Pokemon game ever before.
[9538.42s -> 9539.98s]  And I played it for about an hour
[9539.98s -> 9548.30s]  and then I just never played it ever again.
[9548.30s -> 9550.33s]  That's gen three.
[9550.33s -> 9553.97s]  I heard Pokemon Diamond and Pearl were the,
[9555.60s -> 9556.96s]  those, that's like the best one, right?
[9556.96s -> 9557.80s]  Everybody loves that.
[9557.80s -> 9559.16s]  Isn't that everybody's favorite?
[9559.16s -> 9564.24s]  Besides like green leaf and red, whatever.
[9564.24s -> 9568.10s]  That's everybody's favorite, I thought.
[9568.10s -> 9572.81s]  That's the first 5K I think I've gotten.
[9572.81s -> 9579.59s]  Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum are all gen four.
[9579.59s -> 9584.10s]  Gen two is the best.
[9584.10s -> 9589.38s]  That's gen four.
[9589.38s -> 9594.82s]  I simp for two and three, but four is objectively better.
[9594.82s -> 9609.53s]  All right, Pokemon sucks.
[9609.53s -> 9615.99s]  That's just in there in the sea of comments.
[9616.03s -> 9623.21s]  Ooh, you registered seven bugs.
[9623.21s -> 9626.90s]  Best Pokemon game is the one you played as a kid.
[9626.90s -> 9628.89s]  Now that, you get it.
[9628.89s -> 9640.43s]  You get it.
[9640.43s -> 9643.70s]  So what was the problem with Sword and Shield?
[9644.58s -> 9647.26s]  So every time they do a new Pokemon game,
[9647.26s -> 9657.98s]  they add another like 150 Pokemon, right?
[9657.98s -> 9659.74s]  True, what did I do, what did I say?
[9659.74s -> 9661.42s]  Nothing, it's perfectly fine.
[9667.67s -> 9674.05s]  They didn't advance the series, there was no effort.
[9674.05s -> 9676.49s]  Nothing bad, just literally nothing new.
[9676.49s -> 9680.65s]  Sword and Shield removed a lot of core features.
[9680.65s -> 9690.70s]  They cut half the Pokemon, it was boring.
[9690.70s -> 9692.62s]  Those orb thingies you've been working on, Professor,
[9692.62s -> 9694.08s]  that's those.
[9694.08s -> 9696.36s]  Ugly, stupid, stinky game.
[9696.36s -> 9702.44s]  Whatever, now I got you guys talking.
[9702.44s -> 9704.85s]  Now I got you guys interested.
[9704.85s -> 9707.97s]  All I had to say was, what's your favorite Pokemon, Gen?
[9707.97s -> 9713.75s]  And all of you woke up at the same time.
[9713.75s -> 9716.39s]  Somebody asked what my favorite Pokemon was?
[9716.39s -> 9718.75s]  It's very easy, it's Mewtwo.
[9718.75s -> 9721.35s]  He's the only one that can talk besides Meowth,
[9721.35s -> 9724.82s]  and he's just stronger and cooler than Meowth.
[9724.82s -> 9736.65s]  It's Mewtwo, it's the best Pokemon.
[9736.65s -> 9738.49s]  Lucario can talk.
[9738.49s -> 9741.26s]  No, he can't.
[9741.26s -> 9742.78s]  I suspect it's because different areas of Lentil
[9742.78s -> 9747.64s]  have distinct types of energy flowing through them.
[9747.64s -> 9748.96s]  For now, I want to see the fruits of your,
[9748.96s -> 9750.72s]  oh wait, he can talk.
[9750.72s -> 9752.80s]  What does he say, he says like,
[9752.80s -> 9756.84s]  no, not, not, not, that's Shadow the Hedgehog.
[9756.84s -> 9759.08s]  Chaos, what, no, what is it?
[9759.08s -> 9764.46s]  He says something.
[9764.46s -> 9771.33s]  What does Lucario say when he does something?
[9771.33s -> 9774.02s]  All of them can talk.
[9774.06s -> 9776.66s]  Chaos control, that's Shadow the Hedgehog.
[9776.66s -> 9782.37s]  Lucario says something when he does like a power.
[9782.37s -> 9783.77s]  He just says Lucario.
[9785.77s -> 9789.37s]  No, he talks, doesn't he?
[9789.37s -> 9791.61s]  Lucario says chaos control, what?
[9793.00s -> 9809.94s]  No, that's Shadow the Hedgehog.
[9809.94s -> 9811.70s]  Am I gaslighting myself?
[9811.70s -> 9816.92s]  What is, it's Shadow the Hedgehog, right?
[9816.92s -> 9819.21s]  Oh my gosh, it's so pretty.
[9819.21s -> 9821.77s]  Wow, Lentil's very own light show.
[9821.77s -> 9824.07s]  What did you call it again?
[9824.07s -> 9827.34s]  The Illumina Phenomenon?
[9827.34s -> 9828.42s]  It's interesting how it can occur
[9828.42s -> 9832.72s]  in both Pokemon and planets.
[9832.72s -> 9835.04s]  You can use these orbs to send Pokemon and Crystal Blooms
[9835.04s -> 9842.56s]  into the Illumina state for a while.
[9842.56s -> 9847.06s]  When you do, watch for changes in their surroundings.
[9847.06s -> 9849.02s]  You're gaslighting yourself, I,
[9849.02s -> 9851.40s]  but you guys are like helping me.
[9851.40s -> 9853.40s]  I have a blindfold on,
[9853.40s -> 9858.34s]  and you guys are guiding me around to gaslight myself.
[9858.34s -> 9860.90s]  This is pinned, this is like,
[9860.90s -> 9867.20s]  what's that, like, there's like a pinata hanging down.
[9867.20s -> 9868.80s]  And you guys, I have a blindfold on,
[9868.80s -> 9870.96s]  and like as a joke, you like turned me around
[9870.96s -> 9874.46s]  and like moved me down like the driveway.
[9874.46s -> 9878.22s]  And you're like, hey, your pinata's right in front of you.
[9878.22s -> 9880.42s]  And I'm like, swinging and just missing,
[9880.42s -> 9886.14s]  and I don't understand, and everyone's laughing.
[9886.14s -> 9888.86s]  And it's really funny until I take out the light post
[9888.86s -> 9890.26s]  and fucking down the driveway.
[9890.26s -> 9892.06s]  And it's real funny now, isn't it?
[9892.06s -> 9894.24s]  Do I have to pay for that?
[9894.24s -> 9895.94s]  Do I pay for that?
[9895.98s -> 9897.26s]  When I take the blindfold off
[9897.26s -> 9898.98s]  and I fucking hit your mailbox,
[9898.98s -> 9901.02s]  do I have to pay for that?
[9901.02s -> 9907.58s]  I don't believe I do, I don't think so.
[9907.58s -> 9918.29s]  All right, so now I can turn on those lights.
[9918.29s -> 9919.69s]  Please record yourself doing that
[9919.69s -> 9921.01s]  on a part of a green screen.
[9921.01s -> 9923.01s]  What, with like a blindfold saying like,
[9923.01s -> 9924.17s]  oh, where's the pinata?
[9927.89s -> 9929.89s]  Oh, I'm sad that doesn't already exist.
[9940.23s -> 9942.85s]  Okay, dinner time.
[9942.85s -> 9947.74s]  Sir McFluff loves Fluffies.
[9947.74s -> 9952.90s]  How come this is so cool, I like these.
[9952.90s -> 9957.46s]  Dinner time, as everybody has them eating the apples.
[9957.46s -> 9960.40s]  That's the meta right now.
[9960.40s -> 9964.26s]  This game is so new that the Pokemon eating apples
[9964.26s -> 9977.11s]  is the current most upvoted meta.
[9977.11s -> 9979.39s]  I'm gonna take a picture of a Pokemon
[9979.39s -> 9982.25s]  with an apple in front of them.
[9982.25s -> 9983.89s]  And I'm gonna try to get them biting into it.
[9983.89s -> 9985.33s]  And I'm gonna zoom in,
[9985.33s -> 9990.43s]  and I'm gonna put like snackies underneath it or something.
[9990.43s -> 9992.87s]  And I bet you that's the highest upvoted thing I have.
[9992.87s -> 10002.05s]  Stop meta gaming, why not?
[10002.05s -> 10004.50s]  All right, what are the requests here?
[10004.50s -> 10006.02s]  I heard a really loud noise and it got me wondering,
[10006.06s -> 10008.50s]  do you think Arbok ever falls out of its tree
[10008.50s -> 10011.50s]  while it's sleeping?
[10011.50s -> 10012.34s]  Should I try to get a picture?
[10012.34s -> 10013.75s]  Okay.
[10013.75s -> 10015.54s]  Whoa, Toucans.
[10015.54s -> 10020.70s]  I haven't seen Hickey Peck flying near Toucanon's nest.
[10020.70s -> 10024.91s]  What do you suppose they're up to?
[10024.91s -> 10027.22s]  That's just a Toucan.
[10027.22s -> 10028.62s]  I understand that Pokemons are supposed to be
[10028.62s -> 10030.68s]  kind of like animals and stuff,
[10030.68s -> 10034.66s]  but that's a Toucan, that's not Toucanon.
[10034.66s -> 10038.95s]  That's just a Toucan.
[10038.95s -> 10044.73s]  Why can't you just say it's near the Toucan's nest?
[10044.73s -> 10048.26s]  It has a gun, it has a cannon.
[10048.66s -> 10049.90s]  They're getting lazy.
[10051.96s -> 10055.36s]  It's just a couple, like a golden retriever runs by.
[10055.36s -> 10060.00s]  Oh, that's Goldidio, Goldidio.
[10060.00s -> 10067.10s]  That's the one right there.
[10067.10s -> 10068.80s]  All right, I'll go for it.
[10068.80s -> 10069.92s]  Let's go back during the day.
[10069.92s -> 10075.78s]  I wanna try to get the Toucan.
[10075.78s -> 10081.25s]  There's a Corgi.
[10081.25s -> 10085.26s]  Well, here, you have to give a little bit of credit though.
[10085.26s -> 10088.70s]  Do you really, how hard do you think it is eventually here
[10088.70s -> 10092.66s]  to create Pokemon for like the 15th generation
[10094.14s -> 10094.98s]  or whatever?
[10094.98s -> 10097.30s]  Oh shit, okay, we're gonna have like a little monkey.
[10097.30s -> 10098.66s]  We already have like five of those,
[10098.66s -> 10101.65s]  but have him have like a weird tail this time.
[10101.65s -> 10113.02s]  We have like 30 moths, but make this moth sing.
[10113.02s -> 10121.03s]  All right, where's this Toucan nest?
[10121.03s -> 10122.19s]  I think that guy's awake.
[10122.19s -> 10123.83s]  What the hell is that thing?
[10123.83s -> 10124.67s]  What is that thing?
[10124.67s -> 10125.49s]  What is that?
[10125.49s -> 10126.89s]  That's a rare.
[10126.89s -> 10137.45s]  That was a rare and I just didn't even get a picture of it.
[10137.45s -> 10138.49s]  Look at this guy.
[10138.49s -> 10141.21s]  What the hell is that thing?
[10141.21s -> 10143.38s]  That's a sock.
[10143.38s -> 10145.50s]  Oh, that's not its face.
[10145.50s -> 10146.54s]  That's not its face.
[10146.58s -> 10158.32s]  I thought it was like a big sock puppet.
[10158.32s -> 10161.14s]  Holy shit, he's right next to me.
[10161.14s -> 10168.21s]  Don't be concerned.
[10168.21s -> 10172.62s]  What's that?
[10172.62s -> 10173.44s]  That's the one they were giving away.
[10173.44s -> 10177.26s]  This is the one they were giving away for free, right?
[10177.26s -> 10187.55s]  During the, what was it, not E3.
[10187.55s -> 10191.00s]  That's a Wooper watch right there, yeah.
[10191.00s -> 10197.42s]  Okay, where's this Toucan?
[10197.42s -> 10201.38s]  I almost hit him.
[10201.38s -> 10204.79s]  Where's the Toucan nest?
[10204.79s -> 10211.95s]  Hey, go look at the Toucan nest.
[10211.95s -> 10220.73s]  Hmm, I don't see a Toucan nest.
[10220.73s -> 10225.27s]  Wait, okay, there's the Toucan.
[10225.27s -> 10230.92s]  What was I supposed to be filming here?
[10230.96s -> 10233.92s]  Whoa, can I get you jumping?
[10233.92s -> 10237.46s]  I wanna get you jumping off this.
[10237.46s -> 10239.87s]  He's gonna do a jump.
[10239.87s -> 10240.95s]  Jump?
[10240.95s -> 10254.17s]  Holy shit, did I get it?
[10254.17s -> 10261.48s]  What photo am I trying to get here?
[10261.48s -> 10266.62s]  What was I trying to get?
[10266.62s -> 10281.49s]  Oh, Snacky's right.
[10281.49s -> 10282.33s]  It is just a Toucan.
[10282.33s -> 10284.03s]  Yeah, it is.
[10284.03s -> 10285.63s]  You can have other animals in the universe.
[10285.63s -> 10294.04s]  I don't know why they all have to be Pokemon.
[10294.04s -> 10296.04s]  All right, Germamites, it's that time of the stream again.
[10296.04s -> 10298.72s]  Can we get a Wubba Lubba Dub Dub in the chat right now?
[10298.72s -> 10301.27s]  I hope so.
[10301.27s -> 10303.43s]  Yeah, because people are gonna really think you're funny
[10303.43s -> 10305.71s]  or you just got blocked.
[10306.63s -> 10317.67s]  I like 10,000 people.
[10317.67s -> 10319.56s]  Come on, Snacky's.
[10319.56s -> 10323.70s]  Come on, let me give me a Snacky's.
[10323.70s -> 10324.54s]  What about you?
[10324.54s -> 10328.55s]  Will you do a Snacky's?
[10328.55s -> 10329.63s]  Give me a Snacky's.
[10329.63s -> 10332.20s]  Here it comes, come on.
[10332.20s -> 10334.72s]  Oh, that's perfect, Snacky's.
[10334.72s -> 10335.68s]  That's gonna be perfect.
[10335.68s -> 10349.20s]  I want that one.
[10349.20s -> 10350.64s]  I still don't understand how this works.
[10350.64s -> 10364.78s]  Probably should have paid attention.
[10364.78s -> 10366.88s]  Eat?
[10366.88s -> 10367.72s]  What do you think?
[10367.72s -> 10368.93s]  Apple?
[10368.93s -> 10371.55s]  I don't get it.
[10371.55s -> 10374.11s]  Cats not like apples?
[10374.11s -> 10383.79s]  I guess not.
[10383.79s -> 10385.47s]  People forget that these Pokemon attack
[10385.47s -> 10389.54s]  could kill each other out in the wild.
[10389.54s -> 10390.38s]  That's what I was saying.
[10390.38s -> 10391.36s]  They're like cartoons.
[10391.92s -> 10403.81s]  They're not even animals.
[10403.81s -> 10404.93s]  Okay, what am I missing?
[10404.93s -> 10407.49s]  I'm not gonna replace that one.
[10407.49s -> 10411.59s]  I mean, that one's kind of funny.
[10411.59s -> 10414.12s]  This one even has the right animal.
[10414.12s -> 10419.10s]  That one's better, but yeah, we'll do this one.
[10419.10s -> 10422.00s]  Eh, how could that be possibly better?
[10422.00s -> 10424.34s]  I got the jumping one.
[10424.34s -> 10430.01s]  Oh, what?
[10430.01s -> 10435.29s]  That's not a three star?
[10435.29s -> 10439.78s]  I really thought, I really thought it was that.
[10439.78s -> 10441.86s]  Oh, it fooled me.
[10441.86s -> 10445.74s]  I'm a stupid animal.
[10445.74s -> 10447.26s]  That's what that thing is there for.
[10447.30s -> 10450.30s]  It's to scare other animals.
[10450.30s -> 10458.13s]  I fell for it, yeah.
[10458.13s -> 10466.10s]  None of these are as good.
[10466.10s -> 10469.72s]  That's a good one right there.
[10469.72s -> 10471.64s]  How's that one?
[10471.64s -> 10473.00s]  I'm gonna have to go with the good one though.
[10473.00s -> 10475.60s]  Actually, this one might be, this one's far better.
[10475.60s -> 10476.80s]  This is a three star, but it's not,
[10476.80s -> 10477.64s]  it's kind of off center.
[10477.64s -> 10479.97s]  This one's perfect.
[10479.97s -> 10484.13s]  We'll go with the, we'll go with the two.
[10485.33s -> 10487.68s]  No, it's not better.
[10487.68s -> 10488.52s]  Here we go.
[10488.52s -> 10489.42s]  Snackies!
[10489.42s -> 10490.82s]  Oh my God, perfect.
[10490.82s -> 10491.66s]  This is the one.
[10491.66s -> 10505.64s]  This is the one that's gonna get a thousand upvotes.
[10505.64s -> 10506.48s]  That one's good.
[10506.48s -> 10508.42s]  That one's better.
[10509.10s -> 10513.47s]  Okay, what did he want?
[10513.47s -> 10520.91s]  What was the actual, I don't know what he's,
[10520.91s -> 10525.08s]  what did he want?
[10525.08s -> 10529.61s]  He wanted this one, okay?
[10529.61s -> 10533.16s]  And then a crystal bloom.
[10533.16s -> 10544.52s]  Cool.
[10544.52s -> 10545.80s]  Cooking tacos while watching this?
[10545.80s -> 10547.24s]  How hot are they?
[10547.24s -> 10548.44s]  Are they gonna be hot?
[10548.44s -> 10551.02s]  Are they gonna be mild?
[10551.02s -> 10553.10s]  That determines if you get banned from the channel or not.
[10553.10s -> 10562.55s]  Let's find out.
[10562.55s -> 10565.12s]  That second photo's perfect.
[10565.12s -> 10566.80s]  They're gonna be fucking hot.
[10566.80s -> 10576.28s]  All right, good game.
[10576.28s -> 10585.40s]  Okay, two diamonds.
[10585.44s -> 10587.92s]  All right, here we go.
[10587.92s -> 10589.12s]  Is this one better?
[10589.12s -> 10589.96s]  Yes, it is.
[10589.96s -> 10592.07s]  Way better.
[10592.07s -> 10595.43s]  Yeah, and we're keeping this one.
[10595.43s -> 10596.59s]  And I mean permanently,
[10596.59s -> 10607.83s]  because that's the ultimate snackies photo.
[10607.83s -> 10614.57s]  Is that the one he wanted?
[10614.57s -> 10620.51s]  Didn't fulfill the request?
[10620.51s -> 10621.35s]  Level three.
[10631.76s -> 10635.43s]  You registered 10 species of normal type.
[10635.43s -> 10638.43s]  Okay, save photos to album.
[10638.43s -> 10639.27s]  It's in this one.
[10639.27s -> 10641.50s]  Where is it?
[10641.50s -> 10643.17s]  There it is.
[10643.17s -> 10644.01s]  Perfect.
[10644.01s -> 10644.85s]  Resnap.
[10646.27s -> 10651.22s]  Okay, what do I have of filters?
[10651.22s -> 10659.72s]  What the hell?
[10665.34s -> 10670.72s]  Can't improve perfection.
[10670.72s -> 10681.08s]  But you can.
[10681.08s -> 10682.64s]  I wanna put filters on it.
[10682.64s -> 10688.15s]  Maximum blur.
[10688.15s -> 10697.62s]  That like just hurts my head looking at this.
[10697.62s -> 10703.14s]  This hurts my head.
[10703.14s -> 10706.68s]  Too much blur, I don't like it.
[10706.68s -> 10707.76s]  Raid song.
[10707.76s -> 10710.00s]  Sing the raid song?
[10710.00s -> 10713.51s]  What happened?
[10713.51s -> 10719.03s]  I think there's a desktop background.
[10719.03s -> 10719.87s]  They get raided?
[10719.87s -> 10720.71s]  Who raided?
[10720.71s -> 10723.96s]  Where?
[10723.96s -> 10729.70s]  What are my last updates from seven days ago?
[10729.70s -> 10732.63s]  Where's the raid?
[10732.63s -> 10735.12s]  I can't see.
[10735.12s -> 10736.49s]  Who raided?
[10736.49s -> 10738.32s]  You get a raid?
[10738.32s -> 10739.16s]  Thank you.
[10739.80s -> 10740.64s]  Thank you for the raid.
[10740.64s -> 10741.48s]  Whoever it was, I can't see.
[10741.48s -> 10746.36s]  Why can I not see this?
[10746.36s -> 10747.78s]  I'm gonna go pee.
[10747.78s -> 10750.00s]  First break of the day.
[10750.00s -> 10753.01s]  I'm being trolled, okay.
[10753.01s -> 10754.05s]  All right, I'll be right back.
[10754.05s -> 10756.40s]  I'm gonna pee.
[10756.40s -> 10759.58s]  When I come back, we're gonna complete Snackies.
[10759.58s -> 10764.07s]  I'm gonna be the most famous Pokemon Snap Guy.
[10764.07s -> 11051.84s]  I'll be right back.
[11051.84s -> 11054.64s]  Okay, hello.
[11054.64s -> 11064.82s]  I have returned.
[11064.82s -> 11069.07s]  Let's come back.
[11069.07s -> 11073.17s]  Is it working?
[11073.17s -> 11075.92s]  Why can't I switch?
[11075.92s -> 11077.24s]  There we go, okay.
[11077.24s -> 11079.04s]  All right, I got that saved.
[11079.04s -> 11081.54s]  I have Snackies saved.
[11081.58s -> 11089.60s]  I'll be uploading that later.
[11089.60s -> 11091.56s]  Pissed off a 2K raid.
[11091.56s -> 11094.16s]  I didn't see anything.
[11094.16s -> 11098.38s]  I, who was it?
[11098.38s -> 11102.72s]  You missed the raid for real.
[11102.72s -> 11103.72s]  No, you're liars.
[11103.72s -> 11110.80s]  Nobody, there's nobody here.
[11110.80s -> 11112.44s]  Wait, was it actually a raid?
[11112.44s -> 11116.21s]  Are you guys fucking with me the whole time?
[11116.21s -> 11123.28s]  Hold on, I need to check.
[11123.28s -> 11128.01s]  Hold on, I gotta switch my inputs.
[11128.01s -> 11133.76s]  Let me see.
[11133.76s -> 11138.84s]  Are you guys messing with me here?
[11138.84s -> 11140.16s]  Oh my God, that was a raid.
[11140.16s -> 11141.12s]  It was a big one.
[11141.12s -> 11142.16s]  It was a big one.
[11142.16s -> 11144.28s]  Oh my God, I'm so sorry.
[11144.28s -> 11147.08s]  I'm so sorry, oh my God.
[11147.08s -> 11149.40s]  I thought everyone was fucking around.
[11149.40s -> 11152.10s]  It didn't pop up on my dashboard.
[11152.10s -> 11154.10s]  This is from Jess, Jess, Jessu.
[11154.10s -> 11160.08s]  Thank you for the 2,600 person raid.
[11160.08s -> 11162.20s]  If you still, I like went BRB.
[11162.20s -> 11164.08s]  I was just like, oh, you guys are full of shit.
[11164.08s -> 11165.56s]  And I took off.
[11165.56s -> 11170.78s]  Oh my God, that's, I'm sorry.
[11170.78s -> 11172.06s]  Well, thank you so much.
[11173.56s -> 11178.26s]  And Frans too, I got, I had a raid from Frans.
[11178.26s -> 11179.78s]  Thank you, I'm really sorry.
[11179.78s -> 11181.86s]  I thought I, people do that sometimes.
[11181.86s -> 11184.58s]  They're like, oh, hey raid, a raid's coming in.
[11184.58s -> 11186.14s]  You're getting raided.
[11186.14s -> 11188.62s]  Joe Biden raid, Joe Biden's raiding.
[11188.62s -> 11195.09s]  And I'm like, I've tuned it out by this point.
[11195.09s -> 11196.57s]  But thank you, welcome if you're still here
[11196.57s -> 11199.05s]  or if you just left, cause like I'm an asshole
[11199.05s -> 11202.45s]  and a raid came in and I just fucking said, nice joke.
[11202.45s -> 11204.97s]  Nobody raided and then went to the bathroom.
[11204.97s -> 11206.33s]  I look awful right now.
[11206.33s -> 11209.21s]  Can we just make, hey Mike, can I apologize
[11209.21s -> 11212.05s]  to the Jess, the Jess community?
[11212.09s -> 11213.21s]  Please, I'm sorry.
[11213.21s -> 11220.47s]  I did not mean to do that.
[11220.47s -> 11221.51s]  Anyways, welcome, how you doing?
[11221.51s -> 11228.68s]  Hope you had a good stream Jess.
[11228.68s -> 11230.16s]  I feel like awful right now.
[11230.16s -> 11232.28s]  I feel awful.
[11232.28s -> 11234.40s]  Okay, let's go back to it.
[11234.40s -> 11241.20s]  Taking pictures of money animals.
[11241.20s -> 11243.76s]  I know a lot of you here are waiting for Pac-Man
[11243.76s -> 11247.36s]  and I'm going to stall for a very long time.
[11247.36s -> 11256.09s]  Be aware of that.
[11256.09s -> 11258.81s]  What else was there?
[11258.81s -> 11263.68s]  In the tall grass, okay.
[11263.68s -> 11265.52s]  I think I heard a Pokemon crying around here,
[11265.52s -> 11267.12s]  but where is it coming from?
[11267.12s -> 11270.24s]  Okay, somewhere in with all of the flowers.
[11270.24s -> 11271.08s]  In the day, right?
[11271.08s -> 11274.23s]  Yeah.
[11274.23s -> 11275.91s]  Upload the Snackies picture.
[11275.91s -> 11290.64s]  I will.
[11290.64s -> 11292.28s]  Apology song or it's over.
[11293.20s -> 11304.48s]  What's over?
[11304.48s -> 11310.49s]  Apology song.
[11310.49s -> 11311.65s]  I'm sorry.
[11311.65s -> 11314.68s]  I'm sorry.
[11314.68s -> 11318.69s]  At your bottom dollar that I'm sorry.
[11318.69s -> 11319.53s]  Will be.
[11324.21s -> 11327.13s]  The sun will come out tomorrow.
[11327.13s -> 11334.60s]  At your bottom dollar that tomorrow.
[11334.60s -> 11336.56s]  Tomorrow, tomorrow.
[11336.56s -> 11337.40s]  Smile at me.
[11337.40s -> 11338.24s]  Tomorrow.
[11339.08s -> 11347.43s]  You're only a day away.
[11347.43s -> 11348.27s]  That wasn't even a,
[11348.27s -> 11349.47s]  that wasn't a modern apology song.
[11349.47s -> 11354.12s]  I just sang you a song from Annie.
[11354.12s -> 11356.04s]  No, no, don't do it.
[11356.04s -> 11356.88s]  Don't do it.
[11356.88s -> 11359.27s]  Oh my God, I'm going to do it.
[11359.27s -> 11360.11s]  Ew.
[11360.11s -> 11361.12s]  Ew.
[11361.12s -> 11361.96s]  Ew.
[11361.96s -> 11363.92s]  Ew.
[11363.92s -> 11364.76s]  No.
[11364.76s -> 11365.60s]  Ew.
[11365.60s -> 11366.44s]  Don't do it.
[11366.44s -> 11367.28s]  I don't know.
[11367.28s -> 11376.50s]  Just go back to what I was doing.
[11376.50s -> 11385.07s]  I went that tall grass.
[11385.07s -> 11387.96s]  There was kind of a lightsaber in that room.
[11387.96s -> 11389.84s]  Yeah, I do got a lightsaber in this room.
[11389.84s -> 11393.04s]  You want to fuck with me?
[11393.04s -> 11394.32s]  Huh?
[11394.32s -> 11395.52s]  Oh, what's that?
[11395.52s -> 11405.72s]  Oh, excuse me.
[11405.72s -> 11406.56s]  Oh, what's that?
[11406.56s -> 11409.56s]  He's got a lightsaber in his room, don't he?
[11409.56s -> 11420.40s]  Don't fuck with me.
[11420.40s -> 11422.32s]  I'm supposed to, I gotta take a picture of something.
[11422.32s -> 11436.00s]  Holy shit, I look like I fucking live under the bridge.
[11436.00s -> 11440.28s]  Put this down.
[11440.28s -> 11441.80s]  Get that fucking saber out of here.
[11441.80s -> 11449.44s]  All right, where's that tall grass?
[11449.44s -> 11457.52s]  There's something crying, it said.
[11457.52s -> 11459.60s]  All right, here's the tall grass.
[11459.60s -> 11462.65s]  There's something crying over here.
[11462.69s -> 11467.16s]  Anybody hear anything crying?
[11467.16s -> 11469.96s]  Ah, it's you.
[11469.96s -> 11470.80s]  No, it's not.
[11470.80s -> 11473.76s]  Who's crying?
[11473.76s -> 11478.29s]  Tall grass, something crying right here.
[11478.29s -> 11484.08s]  Who's crying?
[11484.08s -> 11486.02s]  You?
[11486.02s -> 11488.77s]  Are you crying?
[11488.77s -> 11494.11s]  I don't think that bird is crying.
[11494.11s -> 11504.79s]  Who's crying?
[11504.79s -> 11506.47s]  No, please, why, why, why?
[11506.47s -> 11507.95s]  What happened?
[11507.95s -> 11509.75s]  Whoa, I can throw that?
[11509.75s -> 11523.92s]  I didn't know I could do that.
[11523.92s -> 11526.92s]  I got it.
[11526.92s -> 11527.76s]  I heard.
[11537.71s -> 11549.14s]  What was crying?
[11549.14s -> 11552.22s]  Somebody said, you look like Dumb and Dumber together.
[11552.22s -> 11562.28s]  Like fused together.
[11562.28s -> 11594.59s]  Like Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey.
[11594.59s -> 11602.32s]  You look like a weatherman.
[11602.32s -> 11603.76s]  Okay, I gotta stop it.
[11605.76s -> 11607.52s]  Hey, I know there are plenty of,
[11607.52s -> 11615.76s]  there are plenty of very handsome weathermen.
[11615.76s -> 11621.61s]  I like that one, it's cute.
[11621.61s -> 11626.43s]  You look like a Dutch Renaissance artist.
[11626.43s -> 11628.70s]  Roll out the mustache.
[11628.70s -> 11633.88s]  You know, I only, I only have this
[11633.88s -> 11635.36s]  because I wanted to turn the webcam on
[11635.36s -> 11637.32s]  and scare everybody.
[11637.32s -> 11651.32s]  Everybody likes it, but keep it?
[11651.32s -> 11652.44s]  Keep it.
[11653.28s -> 11654.12s]  I hate it.
[11654.12s -> 11654.96s]  I don't like it.
[11654.96s -> 11655.92s]  Keep it, yes.
[11655.92s -> 11659.41s]  Go a whole month doing it.
[11659.41s -> 11672.58s]  You went from looking 25 to 65.
[11672.58s -> 11678.12s]  Keep it, keep it.
[11678.12s -> 11680.16s]  All right, well, I apparently messed up.
[11688.02s -> 11693.92s]  It's a disgustingly handsome mustache.
[11693.92s -> 11696.19s]  Okay, so let me,
[11696.19s -> 11702.23s]  I just repeated what she just said, but still.
[11702.23s -> 11704.07s]  Stick thieves caught on cam.
[11704.07s -> 11711.85s]  Shit, the meta is changing very quickly,
[11711.85s -> 11713.93s]  hourly, on an hourly basis.
[11713.93s -> 11716.53s]  It was snacks.
[11716.53s -> 11718.97s]  Now it's LOL.
[11718.97s -> 11722.15s]  Look what my ring camera picked up.
[11722.15s -> 11723.47s]  I'm falling behind.
[11723.47s -> 11724.99s]  I'm falling behind.
[11724.99s -> 11726.19s]  I need to be on top of this shit.
[11726.19s -> 11728.47s]  I need to make a new trend.
[11730.54s -> 11742.92s]  This one's cool too, this one's awesome.
[11742.92s -> 11752.03s]  I'm running off of old meta.
[11752.03s -> 11763.50s]  Okay, photo decks.
[11763.50s -> 11764.42s]  No, where is it?
[11764.42s -> 11774.66s]  It's my folder, right?
[11774.66s -> 11776.94s]  I'm literally about to bite somebody.
[11776.94s -> 11778.70s]  Settle down, sit down.
[11778.70s -> 11785.03s]  What's wrong with you?
[11785.03s -> 11791.69s]  Album, okay.
[11791.69s -> 11792.85s]  Maybe you can view photos you've saved
[11792.85s -> 11793.69s]  after your research trips,
[11793.69s -> 11796.19s]  including edited photos and re-snaps.
[11796.19s -> 11798.50s]  All right, there's Snackies.
[11798.50s -> 11800.42s]  Snackies.
[11800.42s -> 11802.36s]  And now I upload this.
[11802.36s -> 11803.20s]  All right, does this like,
[11803.20s -> 11805.78s]  this doesn't like,
[11805.78s -> 11807.86s]  what do you see like my fucking like,
[11807.86s -> 11808.70s]  I don't know.
[11808.70s -> 11815.19s]  I don't even see my account name.
[11815.19s -> 11819.59s]  Read the precautions from the internet.
[11819.59s -> 11820.43s]  What are you talking about?
[11820.43s -> 11826.55s]  Read the internet precautions.

[11836.99s -> 11843.81s]  What's going on?
[11843.81s -> 11845.82s]  All right, I wanna,
[11845.82s -> 11847.62s]  yeah, I'm really glad I didn't show this
[11847.62s -> 11849.06s]  because it shows like my fucking,
[11849.06s -> 11850.74s]  like my friend code up here.
[11850.74s -> 11860.16s]  I don't want people to have that.
[11860.16s -> 11870.58s]  There, Snackies.
[11870.58s -> 11871.66s]  Okay, I did it.
[11871.66s -> 11872.90s]  I got it.
[11872.90s -> 11880.82s]  It's there.
[11880.82s -> 11884.93s]  He doesn't want us as friends.
[11884.93s -> 11888.39s]  No, I don't.
[11888.39s -> 11890.59s]  I don't.
[11890.59s -> 11894.95s]  I don't want to be incessantly spammed
[11894.95s -> 11896.79s]  with 5,000 friend requests
[11896.79s -> 11900.76s]  every time I turn on my fucking Nintendo Switch.
[11900.76s -> 11902.20s]  I'm sorry, but that's the fact.
[11902.20s -> 11911.71s]  That's the truth.
[11911.71s -> 11914.72s]  Mustache changed you.
[11914.72s -> 11921.57s]  What the fuck do you know about anything?
[11921.57s -> 11932.89s]  Excuse me.
[11932.89s -> 11938.88s]  Uh-oh, here comes the evil arc.
[11938.88s -> 11941.94s]  You know what happens when somebody has a mustache.
[11941.94s -> 11946.16s]  Turn fucking evil.
[11946.16s -> 11947.08s]  All right, in the tall grass,
[11947.08s -> 11953.12s]  I'm gonna get this one.
[11953.12s -> 11955.40s]  The mask comes off, huh?
[11955.40s -> 11963.39s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.
[11963.39s -> 11974.50s]  He was sus before and now he's evil.
[11974.50s -> 11976.94s]  Is it weird that I have these strange,
[11976.94s -> 11983.03s]  nightmarish type dreams being invited
[11983.03s -> 11985.31s]  to a Twitch panel of some kind?
[11985.31s -> 11991.72s]  Or an e-clown thing where I'm one of the panelists
[11991.72s -> 11995.12s]  and underneath my nameplate, it says Jerma985
[11995.12s -> 11997.52s]  and then there's a lower thirds graphics come up
[11997.52s -> 12001.42s]  that says the sus guy and it has like that face.
[12001.42s -> 12016.70s]  That's like why I got invited.
[12016.70s -> 12020.76s]  And I have to, I have a microphone in front of me
[12020.76s -> 12026.21s]  and five to 10 times during the Q&A section,
[12026.21s -> 12028.69s]  somebody comes up to like ask a question.
[12028.69s -> 12031.13s]  They go, this one's for Jerma.
[12031.13s -> 12033.40s]  I lean in, yeah, what's up, man?
[12033.40s -> 12039.08s]  Hey, what do you think about this like red trash can?
[12039.08s -> 12042.46s]  Don't you think it looks a little sus?
[12042.46s -> 12044.46s]  And then I like have to smile and go.
[12046.95s -> 12056.11s]  And everybody in the audience like claps and shit and laughs.
[12056.11s -> 12063.11s]  I don't want that to happen to me.
[12063.95s -> 12073.86s]  Grass is coming up.
[12073.86s -> 12079.60s]  That's too late, it's inevitable.
[12079.60s -> 12082.45s]  Whoa, that was cool, do that again.
[12082.45s -> 12088.96s]  Hello, do that again.
[12088.96s -> 12099.68s]  How about do it again?
[12099.68s -> 12102.92s]  What did I get wrong here?
[12102.92s -> 12109.22s]  I'm over the two cannon, right?
[12109.22s -> 12122.61s]  All grass, I feel bad for Jerma in that regard.
[12122.61s -> 12130.58s]  Wait, shiny, all right, here we go again.
[12130.58s -> 12131.94s]  So there's something crying.
[12131.94s -> 12134.30s]  I need to like activate this thing
[12134.30s -> 12139.72s]  and find the thing that's crying.
[12139.72s -> 12142.81s]  It's like bullet drop with this shit, come on.
[12142.85s -> 12144.01s]  Somebody's crying here.
[12149.31s -> 12154.10s]  Who's crying?
[12154.10s -> 12162.32s]  I don't see anybody crying in the tree.
[12162.32s -> 12178.06s]  I don't, hello, somebody crying?
[12178.06s -> 12193.48s]  Nobody here, what the hell?
[12193.48s -> 12194.80s]  In the tall grass, yeah,
[12194.80s -> 12200.14s]  but isn't this where the photo was?
[12200.14s -> 12208.08s]  It's one of these peaky pecks, it has to be.
[12208.08s -> 12209.16s]  Well, I'm just gonna skip this one
[12209.16s -> 12219.04s]  because I don't get it.
[12219.04s -> 12240.38s]  We are all crying, crying, call us.
[12240.38s -> 12242.10s]  None of these are bad, I just, no.
[12242.10s -> 12246.00s]  I'm not showing any photos.
[12246.96s -> 12252.39s]  It's a kid's game, how do you not get it?
[12252.39s -> 12256.15s]  Yeah, and Tic-Tac-Toe is also a kid's game.
[12256.15s -> 12257.83s]  And you get your ass kicked in that one too,
[12257.83s -> 12273.70s]  don't you, all the time.
[12273.70s -> 12275.42s]  You gotta use the zoom function.
[12275.42s -> 12279.67s]  No, don't, thank you, the one chatter.
[12279.67s -> 12281.82s]  Sudden movement, okay.
[12281.82s -> 12286.55s]  I saw tan growth suddenly move in the most amazing way.
[12286.55s -> 12287.75s]  I already have one of these pictures.
[12287.75s -> 12289.63s]  All right, we're going to take that photo.
[12289.63s -> 12309.02s]  Tan growth is a solution to never lose Tic-Tac-Toe.
[12309.02s -> 12310.38s]  Yeah, but then that makes you,
[12310.38s -> 12315.38s]  that makes you, oh, yeah, shush, shush, shush, shush.
[12315.42s -> 12317.58s]  That makes you an asshole.
[12317.58s -> 12318.42s]  No one wants to play Tic-Tac-Toe with you
[12318.42s -> 12325.42s]  if you're gonna do that.
[12325.42s -> 12333.23s]  Those are cool.
[12333.23s -> 12335.50s]  Okay, there it is.
[12335.50s -> 12339.99s]  Now wake up and do the thing.
[12339.99s -> 12346.22s]  Did I miss it?
[12346.22s -> 12367.56s]  Jump, jump, jump, jump.
[12367.56s -> 12373.32s]  Did I get it?
[12373.32s -> 12375.33s]  I think I got it.
[12375.33s -> 12382.95s]  Oh, there was something else too.
[12382.95s -> 12387.34s]  That's a good one.
[12387.34s -> 12390.54s]  And that's new.
[12390.54s -> 12391.38s]  No, it's not.
[12391.38s -> 12396.14s]  All right, let's activate this.
[12397.06s -> 12406.48s]  Wake up.
[12406.48s -> 12407.32s]  You're losing viewers.
[12407.32s -> 12410.34s]  What are you gonna do to make people stay?
[12410.34s -> 12413.59s]  I don't know.
[12413.59s -> 12418.05s]  Nothing.
[12418.05s -> 12419.17s]  All right, there's somebody sleeping over here
[12419.17s -> 12428.76s]  that's not supposed to be sleeping over here, right?
[12428.76s -> 12430.44s]  Wait, there's the Dorito.
[12430.44s -> 12432.54s]  There's the Dorito bird.
[12432.54s -> 12433.38s]  That was really cool.
[12433.38s -> 12434.66s]  I wish I took a picture of it.
[12434.66s -> 12437.30s]  Wait, what do I have to do with the Pidgeotto?
[12437.30s -> 12441.04s]  What do I do?
[12441.04s -> 12442.08s]  Oh, feet, apples.
[12442.08s -> 12447.49s]  He likes to eat.
[12447.49s -> 12454.61s]  He's gonna warm up to me, right?
[12454.61s -> 12462.90s]  Look this way and be happy.
[12462.90s -> 12468.20s]  I sort of meow.
[12468.20s -> 12469.28s]  What was that?
[12469.68s -> 12481.61s]  The Magikarp's dying.
[12481.61s -> 12485.17s]  Looks like the Beedoof have finished building their dam.
[12485.17s -> 12491.41s]  Oh my God, that's so cute.
[12491.41s -> 12492.61s]  It's you.
[12492.61s -> 12493.81s]  You're the one that's not supposed to,
[12493.81s -> 12499.44s]  you're the cute one that's not sleeping, right?
[12499.44s -> 12516.45s]  Holy shit, that's a rare Pokemon.
[12516.45s -> 12525.16s]  Oh, this is where we get the bird foot.
[12525.16s -> 12526.75s]  Get it.
[12526.75s -> 12530.45s]  Why is my arm so weak?
[12530.45s -> 12531.33s]  Got it, right?
[12531.33s -> 12533.50s]  That's what I needed, right?
[12533.50s -> 12534.34s]  What's that thing?
[12534.34s -> 12537.80s]  What's that thing?
[12537.80s -> 12553.17s]  Oh, where do I go?
[12553.17s -> 12553.99s]  What was that?
[12553.99s -> 12555.69s]  Something's moving in the flowers.
[12555.69s -> 12561.39s]  Holy shit.
[12561.39s -> 12564.37s]  That's perfect shot.
[12565.25s -> 12572.88s]  These things are so dull.
[12572.88s -> 12573.76s]  They don't like do anything.
[12573.76s -> 12574.64s]  They don't move.
[12574.64s -> 12575.48s]  Like come here.
[12575.48s -> 12588.52s]  You guys are kind of dull.
[12588.52s -> 12590.56s]  They're just bees.
[12590.56s -> 12600.01s]  They're kind of a dull Pokemon.
[12600.01s -> 12601.09s]  Dull.
[12601.09s -> 12601.93s]  Oh, nice.
[12601.93s -> 12609.78s]  Okay, I got the Smash Brothers side bee.
[12609.82s -> 12610.86s]  Which one's the best?
[12610.86s -> 12615.46s]  Probably that one.
[12615.46s -> 12626.30s]  Two or yeah, that one.
[12626.30s -> 12627.14s]  I didn't get it.
[12627.14s -> 12628.72s]  I missed it somehow.
[12628.72s -> 12629.88s]  I don't know how I missed it.
[12629.88s -> 12630.72s]  Don't ask me.
[12632.42s -> 12634.14s]  This is so stupid.
[12635.10s -> 12642.68s]  I'm gonna do this one.
[12642.68s -> 12646.00s]  That looks like the battle bus.
[12646.00s -> 12646.84s]  Battle.
[12646.84s -> 12648.04s]  Oh no, you said battle pass.
[12648.04s -> 12662.81s]  I was like, what's a battle bus?
[12662.81s -> 12666.28s]  All right, what's the one that I need?
[12666.28s -> 12668.08s]  That one?
[12668.08s -> 12675.17s]  I think it's this one, right?
[12675.17s -> 12678.70s]  You literally know what the battle bus is.
[12678.70s -> 12680.76s]  Ooh.
[12680.76s -> 12681.60s]  Which one?
[12681.60s -> 12692.68s]  Probably that one.
[12692.68s -> 12695.36s]  Shit.
[12695.36s -> 12705.71s]  I kind of have to go with this one.
[12705.71s -> 12706.79s]  This is the foot one.
[12715.73s -> 12716.65s]  Do I have twos?
[12716.69s -> 12717.89s]  I have twos and I have a one.
[12717.89s -> 12719.89s]  All right, this is a three and a four.
[12719.89s -> 12721.29s]  This one, definitely.
[12721.29s -> 12727.48s]  Without a doubt.
[12727.48s -> 12729.89s]  I like this one better.
[12729.89s -> 12730.73s]  Who was sleeping?
[12730.73s -> 12731.57s]  Did I get the one?
[12731.57s -> 12732.57s]  All right.
[12732.57s -> 12735.84s]  This one's sleeping.
[12735.84s -> 12743.21s]  Let's go.
[12743.21s -> 12748.79s]  Oh, Pac-Man, he's crying.
[12748.79s -> 12752.77s]  Well, he can cry until I play the game.
[12752.77s -> 12755.16s]  It's coming up soon, I don't know.
[12755.16s -> 12758.84s]  That's all, I'm just hanging out.
[12758.84s -> 12765.68s]  Stop taking photos, you peeked at snackies.
[12765.68s -> 12771.97s]  I don't think, yeah, I didn't get the thing.
[12771.97s -> 12776.06s]  Nice.
[12776.06s -> 12776.94s]  Nice work.
[12776.94s -> 12782.68s]  That's pretty good.
[12783.64s -> 12799.34s]  This is a bad picture, but I think it's what he wanted.
[12799.34s -> 12800.99s]  That's a good one.
[12800.99s -> 12802.92s]  This should be diamond, right?
[12802.92s -> 12806.89s]  Yep.
[12806.89s -> 12809.93s]  Your photos are swag.
[12809.93s -> 12812.08s]  Thanks.
[12812.08s -> 12816.00s]  I'll get a Pokemon bonus for this.
[12816.00s -> 12816.84s]  What's with the placement?
[12816.84s -> 12826.32s]  Why was that so good?
[12826.32s -> 12828.93s]  This is a better picture though.
[12828.93s -> 12829.77s]  Whatever.
[12834.48s -> 12837.82s]  That's gonna be really good.
[12837.82s -> 12839.02s]  Placement is perfect.
[12839.02s -> 12839.94s]  That's diamond.
[12839.94s -> 12842.08s]  No.
[12842.08s -> 12849.48s]  Whatever.
[12849.48s -> 12851.25s]  Better than what I had.
[12851.25s -> 12852.56s]  What?
[12852.60s -> 12861.64s]  Well, I have to keep this one because he wants this one.
[12861.64s -> 12865.12s]  Why do I not have one single photo of this guy?
[12865.12s -> 12870.04s]  For one star.
[12870.04s -> 12878.32s]  I feel like I take 30 pictures of that guy.
[12878.32s -> 12891.06s]  Oh shit.
[12891.06s -> 12892.02s]  I love this one on the right.
[12892.02s -> 12893.14s]  The guy going, yes.
[12906.16s -> 12909.72s]  Why do you play baby games?
[12909.72s -> 12911.24s]  Because they're really easy
[12911.24s -> 12913.72s]  and I don't have to think too hard.
[12913.72s -> 12916.46s]  That's why.
[12916.46s -> 12917.90s]  Well, because it's really simple
[12917.90s -> 12920.47s]  and I don't have to think that much.
[12920.47s -> 12921.63s]  That's a professor's favorite.
[12921.63s -> 12922.47s]  What a great photo.
[12922.47s -> 12924.11s]  I'll go ahead and upload it as my new favorite.
[12924.11s -> 12926.85s]  What do you mean you gotta upload that?
[12926.85s -> 12927.89s]  No, that's my photo.
[12927.89s -> 12932.12s]  You're not gonna take it and upload it on your account?
[12932.12s -> 12934.88s]  I'm, that's, and you put like your signature on it.
[12934.88s -> 12939.44s]  He stamped it as his.
[12939.44s -> 12940.68s]  All right, I've uploaded the photo.
[12940.68s -> 12942.08s]  Go to the internet and check your page.
[12942.08s -> 12942.92s]  What?
[12942.92s -> 12953.85s]  I didn't want you to do that.
[12953.85s -> 12958.87s]  Reddit him.
[12958.87s -> 12960.75s]  He's gonna sell it as an NFT.
[12967.30s -> 12969.58s]  You got a total of one sweet medal.
[12969.58s -> 12971.17s]  Oh!
[12971.17s -> 12981.68s]  Somebody sweeted my picture.
[12981.68s -> 12984.72s]  Combi are very devoted to Vespiquen.
[12984.72s -> 12985.72s]  If you observe them closely,
[12985.72s -> 12989.04s]  you see that these Pokemon do more than just gather nectar.
[12989.04s -> 13000.37s]  It all happened here.
[13000.37s -> 13001.89s]  This is, I want this.
[13001.89s -> 13003.45s]  Why can't I, I want these filters.
[13003.45s -> 13004.85s]  I want this filter.
[13007.47s -> 13008.75s]  I want that.
[13008.75s -> 13010.39s]  How come I don't have those?
[13010.39s -> 13019.60s]  I would do so much better work.
[13019.60s -> 13021.45s]  All right, I can go here at night.
[13021.45s -> 13023.82s]  That's a hit.
[13023.82s -> 13027.28s]  Wait, didn't I take this picture?
[13027.28s -> 13031.94s]  I took this photo.
[13031.94s -> 13038.48s]  I took that photo.
[13038.48s -> 13040.44s]  I heard a really loud noise and it got me wondering,
[13040.44s -> 13042.76s]  do you think Arbok ever falls out of its tree
[13042.76s -> 13043.60s]  while it's sleeping?
[13043.60s -> 13044.84s]  I have to pay attention to that.
[13045.84s -> 13049.74s]  All right, what was this one?
[13049.74s -> 13050.66s]  I already, I took this picture.
[13050.66s -> 13052.18s]  Didn't I get this?
[13052.18s -> 13056.42s]  I see Pic, I see Pikipek flying near Toucanon's nest.
[13056.42s -> 13057.54s]  What do you suppose they're up to?
[13057.54s -> 13060.64s]  I didn't I get, I already got a photo of this.
[13060.64s -> 13061.76s]  All right, we're looking for the big snake
[13061.76s -> 13065.45s]  falling out of the tree.
[13065.45s -> 13066.41s]  What time of day is that?
[13066.41s -> 13067.53s]  Day, it's daytime.
[13067.53s -> 13068.57s]  All right, we're looking for the snake
[13068.57s -> 13081.99s]  falling out of the tree.
[13081.99s -> 13085.23s]  Snake falling out of the tree.
[13085.23s -> 13089.64s]  I don't care about anybody else, just the snake.
[13089.64s -> 13097.43s]  Where is he?
[13097.43s -> 13102.11s]  Where is he?
[13102.11s -> 13102.99s]  All's out of the tree.
[13102.99s -> 13105.90s]  All right, that he's right there.
[13105.90s -> 13106.78s]  He didn't fall out of a tree.
[13106.78s -> 13112.87s]  He's literally right here.
[13112.87s -> 13126.53s]  That was a nighttime mission.
[13126.53s -> 13127.89s]  He's so baked.
[13139.31s -> 13140.27s]  I don't know, somebody,
[13140.27s -> 13142.15s]  somebody pasted something and it was gone instantly.
[13142.15s -> 13151.80s]  I have no idea what you said.
[13151.80s -> 13162.41s]  It was probably a copy pasta.
[13162.41s -> 13164.37s]  Jungle at night, looking for the snake
[13164.37s -> 13171.40s]  falling out of the tree.
[13171.40s -> 13175.28s]  Go check Professor Mirror's hard drive.
[13175.28s -> 13176.12s]  Why?
[13190.52s -> 13192.38s]  Apple?
[13192.38s -> 13194.14s]  All right, where is he?
[13194.14s -> 13196.32s]  Oh, there he is.
[13196.32s -> 13218.56s]  Does he fall out of the tree?
[13218.60s -> 13226.74s]  I don't think, he does not fall out of the tree.
[13226.74s -> 13246.10s]  Okay, come on, bun sweets.
[13246.10s -> 13247.42s]  I have painful stinging blisters
[13247.42s -> 13253.24s]  from walking four miles in flip-flops today.
[13253.24s -> 13254.08s]  What are you thinking?
[13254.08s -> 13258.67s]  What were you thinking?
[13258.67s -> 13261.11s]  You know the maximum amount of walking time
[13261.11s -> 13262.87s]  you should do with flip-flops
[13262.87s -> 13265.43s]  is either slipping them on and off
[13265.43s -> 13267.55s]  to go to where the sand is at the beach
[13267.55s -> 13271.84s]  and maybe walk up on the boardwalk somewhere for a little bit
[13271.84s -> 13273.48s]  or in the amount of time it takes
[13273.48s -> 13275.60s]  to go get your mail from the mailbox.
[13275.60s -> 13277.24s]  How would you do that for four hours?
[13293.74s -> 13294.82s]  I'm surprised, you know what?
[13294.82s -> 13300.08s]  Frankly, I'm surprised you're still alive.
[13300.08s -> 13308.21s]  Someone's sleeping down here, too.
[13308.21s -> 13310.13s]  What if it was a really long driveway?
[13314.74s -> 13316.34s]  All right, why is it missing something else here?
[13316.34s -> 13329.91s]  I got it, I got the snake.
[13329.91s -> 13332.11s]  Something's gonna come out of that ruined door.
[13332.11s -> 13335.92s]  Right, it has to be.
[13335.92s -> 13341.30s]  Something in there.
[13341.30s -> 13342.42s]  An electric eel is gonna come out
[13342.42s -> 13347.50s]  when I put something in there, right?
[13347.50s -> 13349.58s]  You know when an electric eel puts its head out
[13349.58s -> 13352.51s]  and has that weird like, bleh.
[13352.51s -> 13355.68s]  They always come out of holes like that.
[13355.68s -> 13362.43s]  Where is everybody?
[13362.43s -> 13367.07s]  Where's that sound?
[13367.11s -> 13374.80s]  I miss that every time.
[13374.80s -> 13393.64s]  Oh, that's that guy's photo.
[13393.64s -> 13395.99s]  Wait, what's this?
[13395.99s -> 13398.01s]  Who is that?
[13398.01s -> 13399.78s]  Somebody over there.
[13399.78s -> 13403.38s]  Who's acting?
[13403.38s -> 13406.12s]  Oh, it's a woofer.
[13406.12s -> 13410.84s]  You like apples?
[13410.84s -> 13416.48s]  No, he doesn't like me anymore.
[13416.48s -> 13417.32s]  He's pissed.
[13424.23s -> 13443.29s]  What are you still doing awake, woofer?
[13443.29s -> 13449.57s]  All right, I think I got the photo I needed here.
[13449.57s -> 13458.56s]  Family guy waiting room.
[13458.56s -> 13460.24s]  Stop zooming in.
[13460.24s -> 13465.59s]  I get the tool tip that says zoom in more frequently.
[13465.59s -> 13475.05s]  I'm doing what the game is telling me to do.
[13475.05s -> 13478.16s]  What Pokemon would taste the best?
[13478.16s -> 13480.89s]  I don't know, one of the birds?
[13480.89s -> 13493.58s]  Whatever the one is the closest resembling a chicken.
[13493.58s -> 13498.92s]  How do I get these guys to be two?
[13498.92s -> 13504.44s]  I think we'll compare to that photo.
[13504.44s -> 13507.31s]  What the hell?
[13507.31s -> 13509.67s]  I mean, that's clearly what he was looking for.
[13517.76s -> 13526.80s]  This isn't better, no.
[13526.80s -> 13530.53s]  You have to knock him out of the tree.
[13530.53s -> 13534.52s]  I threw a few apples at him, it didn't do anything.
[13534.52s -> 13536.94s]  Ah, this is a woofer.
[13536.94s -> 13538.14s]  That's a good photo, but wait a minute.
[13538.14s -> 13540.40s]  Look at this one.
[13540.40s -> 13543.88s]  Oh, it's this one.
[13543.88s -> 13548.25s]  Throw more apples.
[13548.25s -> 13554.32s]  Ancient ruins.
[13554.32s -> 13556.12s]  Code on your profile is for this game,
[13556.12s -> 13558.40s]  not your Switch friend code, you adult.
[13558.40s -> 13569.80s]  Oh, well.
[13569.80s -> 13573.02s]  I always wanted to eat a Pokemon, why?
[13573.02s -> 13590.77s]  Oh, I don't understand why.
[13590.77s -> 13596.82s]  I didn't see my message, I saw that one.
[13596.82s -> 13600.00s]  Let us see the profile so we can upvote everything.
[13600.00s -> 13602.52s]  No, I'm not gonna game the system
[13602.52s -> 13607.59s]  and have my stuff get upvoted.
[13607.59s -> 13611.41s]  That's, you're probably gonna get my account banned.
[13611.41s -> 13613.73s]  You wanna like brigade my profile?
[13613.73s -> 13632.38s]  You're gonna get me thrown off of the Pokemon Snap forums.
[13632.38s -> 13635.94s]  How am I still level one here?
[13635.94s -> 13637.76s]  All right, there we go, present.
[13637.76s -> 13645.95s]  Snapped a total of 500 photos.
[13645.95s -> 13647.39s]  Am I insane or is he just replaying
[13647.39s -> 13648.71s]  two levels over and over?
[13648.71s -> 13652.02s]  I mean, that's what I have unlocked now.
[13674.16s -> 13676.84s]  Be too popular to play games publicly.
[13677.97s -> 13680.77s]  No, I'm not.
[13680.77s -> 13683.45s]  Okay, who needs wings?
[13683.45s -> 13687.11s]  I just heard Dodrio can fly, never seen one.
[13687.15s -> 13692.45s]  Okay, that's near the end where the owl is.
[13693.41s -> 13700.12s]  And then go find what motivates the combies to work.
[13703.49s -> 13705.05s]  That's all the requests I have for here?
[13705.05s -> 13709.25s]  Oh, what about complete?
[13709.25s -> 13718.62s]  I haven't even been completing quests.
[13718.62s -> 13724.98s]  Are you kidding me?
[13724.98s -> 13726.66s]  Design 13.
[13726.66s -> 13733.84s]  Oh, that's how you get, all right, I get it.
[13733.84s -> 13742.53s]  Completed, what else do I get?
[13742.53s -> 13743.85s]  Ooh, it's an effect.
[13743.85s -> 13747.97s]  Now I can start actually making cool things.
[13748.93s -> 13753.55s]  Complete, making a splash.
[13753.55s -> 13755.87s]  Oh, I forgot the wooden dog toy, that's right.
[13755.87s -> 13765.62s]  I'll go get it after, before I play Pac-Man.
[13765.62s -> 13768.24s]  All right, is this all I have during the night?
[13768.24s -> 13785.25s]  All right, we gotta take a picture of the Dodrio flying.
[13785.25s -> 13786.93s]  Remember, look at the joke tracker right now.
[13786.93s -> 13794.08s]  Market's closed.
[13794.08s -> 13801.24s]  Whoa, oh right, I gotta get him doing this.
[13801.24s -> 13806.61s]  Gotta get him jumping in the air.
[13806.61s -> 13811.41s]  He goes, whoa, and he jumps up.
[13811.41s -> 13815.65s]  Hey, what?
[13815.65s -> 13822.10s]  What the hell was that?
[13822.10s -> 13823.90s]  That was bizarre, that was weird.
[13823.90s -> 13829.09s]  Why did he do that?
[13829.13s -> 13835.52s]  Can he jump again?
[13835.52s -> 13845.25s]  Jump, fine, whatever.
[13845.25s -> 13856.60s]  All right, I need the Dodrio flying right into the owl.
[13856.68s -> 13860.11s]  A lot of them, what was that?
[13860.11s -> 13861.59s]  That's like a weird planet or something.
[13861.59s -> 13862.43s]  What is that?
[13862.43s -> 13865.69s]  It's a person on a parachute.
[13865.69s -> 13870.43s]  That's somebody on a parachute.
[13870.43s -> 13871.55s]  What is that?
[13871.55s -> 13878.58s]  This pink thing, see that?
[13878.58s -> 13879.50s]  Did I miss him flying?
[13879.50s -> 13884.04s]  I think I did.
[13884.04s -> 13884.88s]  Does that count?
[13884.88s -> 13895.52s]  I think does that count as flying?
[13895.52s -> 13899.52s]  How did the stream reach negative 5,000?
[13899.52s -> 13907.50s]  Because people are just spamming it.
[13913.03s -> 13922.67s]  Let me eat these, let me eat these.
[13922.67s -> 13931.41s]  That was good, that was good too.
[13931.41s -> 13932.37s]  He's gonna fly right over here
[13932.37s -> 13936.87s]  and I'm gonna get it, one, two, three.
[13945.83s -> 13952.36s]  All right, Dodrio flying, here he comes.
[13952.36s -> 13953.64s]  What's the best Star Wars?
[13956.17s -> 13959.40s]  Empire Strikes Back.
[13959.40s -> 13965.84s]  I'm actually returning the Jedi guy.
[13965.84s -> 13967.08s]  My favorite of all the movies
[13967.08s -> 13969.68s]  because Mark Hamill looks like a stage hand
[13969.68s -> 13979.19s]  to the whole movie, my favorite.
[13979.19s -> 13984.85s]  When does he fly?
[13984.85s -> 13986.57s]  This is it, ready?
[13986.85s -> 13990.90s]  Shit, where is he?
[13990.90s -> 14005.56s]  There he is, I got it, right?
[14005.56s -> 14012.18s]  Light it up, something is motivating them.
[14012.18s -> 14015.87s]  What's motivating them?
[14015.87s -> 14030.76s]  You, you fly at the end?
[14030.76s -> 14040.96s]  I think I got it.
[14040.96s -> 14042.20s]  Jumping counts, good.
[14042.20s -> 14047.86s]  All right, I got it then.
[14047.86s -> 14052.56s]  I think I completed like three quests here.
[14052.56s -> 14057.29s]  Stupid, stupid.
[14057.29s -> 14059.41s]  I think this, I mean, it just looks weird.
[14068.60s -> 14073.25s]  I don't know, I guess this one's better.
[14073.25s -> 14078.27s]  Cell, cell, that's a good one here.
[14078.27s -> 14085.16s]  Okay, Dodrio flying.
[14085.20s -> 14091.40s]  This one is, it's probably this one.
[14091.40s -> 14098.20s]  Is he Yoto?
[14098.20s -> 14103.04s]  Which one did he, which one did he want?
[14103.04s -> 14105.98s]  I think it's this one, right?
[14105.98s -> 14120.66s]  That one, it's this one.
[14120.66s -> 14125.00s]  Swanna, Sir?
[14125.00s -> 14130.66s]  Okay, Kombi, sure, that one.
[14130.66s -> 14136.19s]  I guess I'll take that one.
[14136.19s -> 14137.63s]  Somebody said pick pictures every time,
[14137.63s -> 14139.76s]  even if you don't need them.
[14139.76s -> 14143.65s]  Because I'm losing out on experience.
[14143.65s -> 14150.08s]  Just as free EXP.
[14150.08s -> 14151.36s]  Do an ASMR of you telling us
[14151.36s -> 14153.76s]  comforting things like I'm proud of you, okay?
[14155.59s -> 14161.06s]  Ahem.
[14161.06s -> 14166.42s]  I am so goddamn proud of you.
[14166.42s -> 14168.15s]  Look what you've done.
[14168.15s -> 14172.25s]  Look what you've been able to accomplish.
[14172.25s -> 14174.02s]  Take a look outside.
[14174.02s -> 14176.04s]  See that sun up there?
[14176.04s -> 14178.32s]  It's shining down on you.
[14178.32s -> 14179.91s]  Go for it.
[14179.91s -> 14182.20s]  Do it.
[14182.20s -> 14186.38s]  You know you can.
[14186.38s -> 14188.87s]  Good luck.
[14188.87s -> 14189.95s]  I almost just leaned in and went.
[14189.95s -> 14194.32s]  That would have been really bad.
[14194.32s -> 14197.71s]  There you go, there you go.
[14197.71s -> 14200.56s]  Where's my money?
[14200.56s -> 14206.57s]  All right, Buffle Ant, that's a good Buffle Ant.
[14206.57s -> 14208.29s]  That was a sarcastic voice.
[14210.99s -> 14218.34s]  Wasn't?
[14218.34s -> 14219.18s]  There's the request.
[14219.18s -> 14221.62s]  Ooh, I've completed his page.
[14221.62s -> 14231.40s]  What's that mean?
[14231.40s -> 14234.87s]  3,500.
[14234.87s -> 14236.66s]  It's new.
[14236.66s -> 14239.65s]  Get it in there.
[14239.65s -> 14245.93s]  Okay, there's the flying Dodrio.
[14245.93s -> 14249.78s]  Dodrio's now complete.
[14249.78s -> 14258.32s]  Plus two JRM to the moon.
[14258.32s -> 14271.35s]  Better photo.
[14271.35s -> 14272.67s]  Why, what the fuck?
[14272.67s -> 14275.81s]  Why is that one so much better?
[14275.81s -> 14278.55s]  What?
[14278.55s -> 14290.63s]  Because I guess he's powering up.
[14290.63s -> 14293.11s]  Mom said it's my turn on the Xbox.
[14293.11s -> 14293.99s]  Go play it.
[14293.99s -> 14294.83s]  It's in the other room.
[14294.83s -> 14297.85s]  I'm on the Switch.
[14297.85s -> 14300.29s]  Can you not differentiate the two consoles?
[14300.29s -> 14306.47s]  I can't help you, little bro.
[14306.47s -> 14313.69s]  It's a better picture.
[14313.69s -> 14315.81s]  This chat is omega fucked right now.
[14327.96s -> 14336.51s]  Okay, now let me get my presents.
[14336.51s -> 14338.27s]  Hey, little bro.
[14343.98s -> 14344.82s]  A movement?
[14344.82s -> 14347.19s]  That's a really bad picture.
[14347.19s -> 14349.63s]  This is more Apple than it is guy jumping.
[14350.92s -> 14360.97s]  Ooh, hey, this one.
[14360.97s -> 14364.60s]  Awesome.
[14364.60s -> 14374.78s]  You got a profile icon, Rita.
[14374.78s -> 14376.58s]  I gotta go back here, right?
[14379.41s -> 14384.11s]  Okay, when, what was his name, Magnum?
[14384.11s -> 14386.03s]  When Magnum gets to the spot,
[14386.03s -> 14388.11s]  starts looking around restlessly.
[14388.11s -> 14399.01s]  Okay, that tree is looking for a friend.
[14399.01s -> 14399.85s]  That's cool.
[14407.81s -> 14409.09s]  Magnum.
[14409.09s -> 14414.09s]  Oh, I dropped my Magnum condom for my monster dong.
[14421.91s -> 14424.55s]  Or is it the other way around?
[14424.55s -> 14428.99s]  Oh, I dropped my monster condom for my Magnum dong.
[14428.99s -> 14429.83s]  It's that one.
[14429.83s -> 14438.69s]  I did it the wrong way.
[14438.69s -> 14445.84s]  Okay, I need to get this big dragon thing.
[14445.84s -> 14457.76s]  I said, I did it the wrong?
[14457.76s -> 14460.56s]  What's that?
[14460.56s -> 14462.56s]  Oh my God, it's an Eevee.
[14464.96s -> 14465.80s]  Whoa.
[14476.69s -> 14477.53s]  Oh.
[14500.39s -> 14502.43s]  I can't believe I just got a picture of an Eevee.
[14502.43s -> 14506.48s]  It's, it's, it's.
[14506.48s -> 14508.19s]  Everyone's.
[14508.19s -> 14510.47s]  Oh my God, I can't believe I got a picture of Eevee.
[14510.47s -> 14512.03s]  That's my- Everyone's.
[14512.03s -> 14523.98s]  Favorite Pokemon.
[14523.98s -> 14525.50s]  Okay, so hold on now.
[14525.50s -> 14536.24s]  When he gets to this tree, he's looking for a friend.
[14536.92s -> 14544.15s]  Did it do anything else?
[14544.15s -> 14546.84s]  Eevee is God tier.
[14546.84s -> 14552.10s]  Always have an Eevee in your party.
[14552.10s -> 14559.59s]  Eevee is, Eevee is air type, water type, ground type,
[14559.59s -> 14572.40s]  and has two earth attacks.
[14572.40s -> 14579.60s]  Okay, so where's the friend?
[14579.60s -> 14581.89s]  Here comes a friend.
[14581.89s -> 14589.84s]  We're looking for the friend.
[14589.84s -> 14594.20s]  Okay, where's the friend?
[14594.20s -> 14595.04s]  You see a friend?
[14595.04s -> 14598.48s]  He's waiting for a friend right here.
[14598.48s -> 14600.04s]  He's looking for a friend right here,
[14600.04s -> 14608.32s]  in front of this tree, behind you.
[14608.32s -> 14610.20s]  No, no, no, no.
[14610.20s -> 14615.29s]  They came from behind.
[14615.29s -> 14617.75s]  All right, let's go attack.
[14617.75s -> 14619.91s]  Oh, there go all of my helicopters.
[14619.91s -> 14622.75s]  They came from, they came from,
[14622.75s -> 14631.62s]  they came, they came from, they came from behind.
[14631.62s -> 14635.12s]  I think it was Eevee, I got it.
[14635.12s -> 14639.85s]  They came from, they came from, from behind, behind.
[14639.85s -> 14651.44s]  They came from-
[14651.44s -> 14656.03s]  Remember, your high is fucked today.
[14656.03s -> 14657.51s]  Go, go complain about it.
[14657.51s -> 14659.80s]  Go complain about it then.
[14659.80s -> 14665.12s]  Go complain about it.
[14665.20s -> 14666.04s]  Sorry, I'm sorry.
[14666.04s -> 14668.04s]  That was the mustache talking.
[14668.04s -> 14674.48s]  That's the mustache is taking it out, is making me do that.
[14674.48s -> 14675.60s]  It's probably just be, which one?
[14675.60s -> 14676.44s]  This one?
[14689.16s -> 14690.32s]  I don't know which one is the best one.
[14690.32s -> 14699.44s]  Probably the jumping one.
[14699.44s -> 14704.76s]  Probably this one.
[14704.76s -> 14706.68s]  I can't replace that one.
[14706.68s -> 14712.03s]  That one's too good.
[14712.03s -> 14714.42s]  Oh, wait, okay, here we go.
[14714.42s -> 14715.66s]  Ooh, perfect, that one's better.
[14715.66s -> 14718.64s]  This one's good.
[14718.64s -> 14728.56s]  This one right here.
[14728.56s -> 14736.06s]  Why is your shot composition so shitty?
[14736.06s -> 14740.34s]  I didn't know I was in film school.
[14740.34s -> 14748.65s]  Nice work.
[14748.65s -> 14750.17s]  This is good EXP.
[14750.17s -> 14753.25s]  It's 5,400.
[14753.25s -> 14758.56s]  Sustache.
[14758.56s -> 14763.28s]  Funny, Jeremy used to be a wedding photographer.
[14763.28s -> 14765.52s]  Um, I'm sorry.
[14765.52s -> 14767.56s]  I think there's something a little different
[14767.56s -> 14771.04s]  with holding a camera and filming people
[14771.04s -> 14775.34s]  than holding two Joy-Con switch controllers
[14775.34s -> 14777.86s]  that don't, you don't have any manual zoom.
[14777.86s -> 14779.02s]  I don't have an ISO.
[14779.02s -> 14781.13s]  I don't have an f-stop.
[14781.13s -> 14785.21s]  And taking pictures of like cartoon animals
[14785.21s -> 14788.67s]  that jump out behind trees and shit.
[14788.67s -> 14789.95s]  This is a little different.
[14789.95s -> 14795.47s]  I guarantee you, if you gave this game to Martin Scorsese,
[14795.47s -> 14797.43s]  he would take like four of these like shitty pictures
[14797.43s -> 14798.47s]  and be like, what the fuck is this?
[14798.47s -> 14799.31s]  What is this game?
[14799.31s -> 14800.51s]  This is cute.
[14800.51s -> 14802.43s]  I'm gonna go on to make million dollar pictures.
[14802.43s -> 14806.21s]  I get to enjoy it.
[14806.21s -> 14819.28s]  Now, you think he'd care?
[14819.28s -> 14822.21s]  Somebody just said, just say it's too hard.
[14822.21s -> 14826.35s]  It's too hard.
[14826.35s -> 14830.97s]  I didn't get anything.
[14830.97s -> 14839.46s]  How is that not the friend?
[14839.46s -> 14846.92s]  I don't understand.
[14846.92s -> 14850.57s]  Do I not get it?
[14850.57s -> 14853.08s]  Yeah.
[14853.08s -> 14854.96s]  When Magnum gets to the spot,
[14854.96s -> 14856.64s]  it starts looking around kind of restlessly.
[14856.64s -> 14859.77s]  Do you think it's looking for one of its friends?
[14859.77s -> 14876.07s]  Isn't Eevee just running around?
[14876.07s -> 14877.03s]  Otto's wood toy.
[14877.03s -> 14879.31s]  I know, I'm gonna get it before I play Pac-Man.
[14879.31s -> 14880.59s]  I'm gonna get it.
[14880.59s -> 14885.07s]  You'll see it, don't worry.
[14885.07s -> 14894.52s]  Good luck.
[14894.52s -> 14902.24s]  Let's go.
[14902.24s -> 14905.82s]  Okay, now wait till he gets here.
[14905.82s -> 14913.56s]  Does the Plato dinosaur like apples?
[14916.27s -> 14924.62s]  No, not really.
[14924.62s -> 14927.11s]  Let's fucking go.
[14927.11s -> 14928.83s]  Viewers are gonna drop if you switch to Pac-Man.
[14928.83s -> 14930.07s]  Remember that.
[14930.07s -> 14940.08s]  Whatever.
[14940.08s -> 14943.83s]  Whoa, look, look.
[14943.83s -> 14944.87s]  I got them.
[14944.87s -> 14952.64s]  That's what he was looking for.
[14952.64s -> 14956.16s]  Dude, I am getting way too excited over
[14956.16s -> 14959.37s]  the back of a cereal box.
[14959.37s -> 14960.21s]  You know what I mean?
[14960.21s -> 14961.53s]  I'm getting way too excited about this.
[14961.53s -> 14968.35s]  I turned 36 this year.
[14968.35s -> 14970.26s]  He's looking.
[14970.26s -> 14977.14s]  What's he looking for?
[14977.14s -> 14981.36s]  It's all eyes on him.
[14981.36s -> 14982.64s]  As long as you're having fun, it's all right.
[14982.64s -> 14991.75s]  Yeah, I know.
[14991.75s -> 14993.63s]  That's too excited.
[14993.63s -> 14994.83s]  Okay, here we go.
[14994.83s -> 14999.68s]  Where is this friend that's apparently over here?
[14999.72s -> 15000.56s]  Is he gonna get here?
[15000.56s -> 15003.97s]  Is he gonna look around?
[15003.97s -> 15008.29s]  I don't see anybody.
[15008.29s -> 15015.09s]  There's nobody here.
[15015.09s -> 15040.52s]  There's nobody here.
[15040.52s -> 15041.36s]  You missed it?
[15041.36s -> 15042.44s]  It's this tree right here.
[15042.44s -> 15043.44s]  It's this one.
[15043.44s -> 15044.44s]  There's nothing here.
[15053.90s -> 15056.20s]  How do I like my steak cooked?
[15056.20s -> 15057.64s]  I like my steak cooked.
[15057.64s -> 15061.66s]  However, the chef wants to prepare it.
[15061.66s -> 15064.83s]  Unless, of course, that's medium rare.
[15064.83s -> 15066.27s]  I listen for it.
[15066.27s -> 15068.35s]  I usually say, oh, however the chef likes it.
[15068.35s -> 15069.39s]  And they go, oh, medium rare?
[15069.39s -> 15070.59s]  And I go, no, no, thank you.
[15070.59s -> 15087.96s]  Medium, please, medium well.
[15087.96s -> 15089.96s]  I'm gonna tell you guys something.
[15089.96s -> 15093.03s]  A lot of you don't wanna hear this.
[15093.03s -> 15095.39s]  Yeah, you guys talk like, okay, boomer,
[15095.39s -> 15097.47s]  like you're a boomer, boomer shit.
[15097.47s -> 15102.22s]  Caring about how cooked your steak is
[15102.22s -> 15109.12s]  is such a boomer thing to care about.
[15109.12s -> 15114.87s]  That's quite a boomer thing to care about.
[15114.87s -> 15118.04s]  Whoa, why is this four?
[15118.04s -> 15125.65s]  I'm gonna use this one.
[15125.65s -> 15126.73s]  I like that.
[15128.13s -> 15130.01s]  Which one, one or two?
[15130.01s -> 15131.73s]  One or two.
[15131.73s -> 15132.57s]  Probably two.
[15137.48s -> 15139.80s]  Caring that somebody likes their steak medium
[15140.64s -> 15141.99s]  versus medium rare.
[15141.99s -> 15145.67s]  I could see like a big fat boomer guy at a grill
[15145.67s -> 15149.31s]  scoffing at the fact that I said that.
[15149.31s -> 15152.35s]  Hey, how do you want your burger?
[15152.35s -> 15153.19s]  Medium, please.
[15153.19s -> 15156.13s]  Okay, you fucking young millennial.
[15156.13s -> 15158.53s]  Oh, I love medium, medium well.
[15158.53s -> 15161.67s]  Sure thing, you want avocado on it too?
[15161.67s -> 15169.29s]  That's a boomer thing to care about.
[15169.29s -> 15180.74s]  That's cute, I like that one.
[15180.74s -> 15182.46s]  The boomers were right.
[15188.81s -> 15193.76s]  I have two of the same picture.
[15194.32s -> 15199.37s]  Different versions of that emo.
[15199.37s -> 15211.65s]  Am I gonna have them all be this?
[15211.65s -> 15226.19s]  This one's better, there's more friends.
[15226.19s -> 15227.43s]  You mean judging someone?
[15227.43s -> 15229.67s]  No, judging somebody on their,
[15229.67s -> 15232.20s]  how they eat their hamburger
[15232.20s -> 15246.01s]  on the temperature of the meat.
[15246.01s -> 15253.61s]  And I don't want to get any foodborne illnesses.
[15253.61s -> 15257.43s]  You know what happens if you don't cook fucking red meat
[15257.43s -> 15259.45s]  all the way through?
[15259.45s -> 15261.05s]  You like your bloody steak,
[15261.05s -> 15262.57s]  you like your bloody hamburger
[15262.57s -> 15267.55s]  with fucking red blood coming out of it?
[15267.55s -> 15291.17s]  Be careful, you're a weakling.
[15291.17s -> 15294.92s]  Myoglobulin, not blood.
[15294.92s -> 15309.44s]  Okay, look, I can make up a Pokemon name for stuff too.
[15309.44s -> 15312.24s]  Mods, please help, Grandpa's shouting at me again.
[15313.20s -> 15314.84s]  I have to get this one, this is one of,
[15314.84s -> 15322.58s]  I have to get a new zone, what's happening?
[15322.58s -> 15323.90s]  I need to get to level two, okay,
[15323.90s -> 15328.00s]  I'll get to level two right here.
[15328.00s -> 15334.37s]  Level two night, let's go.
[15334.37s -> 15337.01s]  Caring about steak is Joe Rogan shit.
[15348.35s -> 15349.63s]  I don't even know what you mean by that,
[15349.63s -> 15350.79s]  but I don't know, somehow I do.
[15350.79s -> 15352.55s]  I don't know what that even means,
[15352.55s -> 15354.83s]  but I kind of knew it, I know what it means.
[15354.83s -> 15355.99s]  It's weird, right?
[15355.99s -> 15365.33s]  I don't really even know what that means.
[15365.33s -> 15371.54s]  You've had elk meat, no, I have not.
[15371.54s -> 15384.36s]  I've not had venison, I've not had elk.
[15384.36s -> 15387.44s]  I keep, I don't want to take any pictures of the spider.
[15387.44s -> 15389.96s]  What was that?
[15389.96s -> 15391.60s]  All right, get a bunch of good photos.
[15391.60s -> 15397.00s]  I just need to level up.
[15397.00s -> 15429.36s]  How do you want your Fortnite burger?
[15429.36s -> 15431.16s]  Are you a juicy or dry kind of guy?
[15432.99s -> 15438.56s]  I'd say probably more in the juicy department.
[15438.56s -> 15439.96s]  I don't like it wet though,
[15439.96s -> 15441.60s]  because then it ruins the bun.
[15441.60s -> 15444.08s]  Everybody that wants like a bloody hamburger,
[15444.08s -> 15445.24s]  it ruins the bun.
[15445.24s -> 15449.52s]  The bun gets seeped in with this pink liquid
[15449.52s -> 15470.47s]  that turns it, it's soppy and gross.
[15470.47s -> 15471.31s]  I really mean this,
[15471.31s -> 15474.67s]  and I might gross somebody out here, but whatever.
[15474.67s -> 15479.10s]  I would prefer if you were to,
[15479.10s -> 15481.38s]  let me just get a photo here.
[15481.38s -> 15486.14s]  I would prefer it if you were to burn my hamburger.
[15486.14s -> 15489.77s]  I mean, like unrecognizable.
[15489.77s -> 15492.57s]  It's like char, it's not even meat anymore,
[15492.57s -> 15494.85s]  than eat a rare hamburger.
[15494.85s -> 15499.03s]  I would rather you leave it on to a point where like,
[15499.03s -> 15502.11s]  you could, like we're talking about burn,
[15502.11s -> 15504.91s]  like light it on fire and let it sit there.
[15504.91s -> 15508.75s]  I'm talking about like the skin on the marshmallow
[15508.75s -> 15510.55s]  when you let it just go in there
[15510.55s -> 15512.83s]  and let this just sit in the campfire.
[15512.83s -> 15514.15s]  And that's what I'm talking about.
[15514.19s -> 15524.06s]  I'd rather eat that than a rare steak.
[15524.06s -> 15525.26s]  I have not taken any pictures.
[15525.26s -> 15534.06s]  I'm supposed to take photos.
[15534.06s -> 15535.10s]  Burger, yes, steak, no.
[15535.10s -> 15539.31s]  Nope, both.
[15539.31s -> 15540.67s]  If you brought a rare steak to me,
[15540.67s -> 15544.69s]  I don't care how nice of a restaurant it is.
[15544.69s -> 15548.05s]  This could be like a $300 plate.
[15548.05s -> 15550.49s]  The finest cut of meat, rare.
[15550.49s -> 15554.49s]  I would order something from the kids menu.
[15554.49s -> 15556.55s]  I'd be like, can I just get like the fucking hot dog,
[15556.55s -> 15559.17s]  the mac and cheese and corn?
[15559.17s -> 15561.70s]  I don't want that.
[15561.70s -> 15577.06s]  I would not eat a rare steak.
[15577.06s -> 15581.98s]  I just don't like it.
[15581.98s -> 15586.98s]  I will eat sushi sometimes on very rare occasions,
[15590.15s -> 15594.95s]  but there's something about that raw red meat.
[15594.95s -> 15599.25s]  I cannot do it.
[15599.25s -> 15602.33s]  Unbased as fuck, my dude, just for your information.
[15610.80s -> 15613.61s]  Heresites are a myth.
[15613.61s -> 15622.96s]  What?
[15622.96s -> 15624.24s]  Would you ever go vegetarian?
[15624.24s -> 15632.10s]  No, I like the taste of chicken too much.
[15635.98s -> 15639.72s]  I love a good steak and cheese sandwich.
[15639.72s -> 15641.34s]  I could never give it up.
[15641.34s -> 15642.54s]  Not in a hundred million years.
[15642.54s -> 15644.62s]  I couldn't, I just couldn't do it.
[15644.62s -> 15648.06s]  Now, they're getting close.
[15648.06s -> 15649.30s]  They're getting close.
[15649.30s -> 15652.42s]  Like the Beyond meat stuff, the Impossible Burger stuff,
[15652.42s -> 15654.82s]  I think Beyond tastes a little better.
[15654.82s -> 15656.44s]  I think Beyond's a better product,
[15656.44s -> 15660.34s]  if I have to be honest with you.
[15660.34s -> 15662.90s]  They might get there soon.
[15662.90s -> 15668.10s]  Like I'm gonna give it probably like 10 years.
[15668.10s -> 15670.75s]  10 more years, I think they're gonna get it.
[15670.79s -> 15672.71s]  They'll figure out the chemical composition
[15672.71s -> 15674.31s]  to make it so you're eating meat,
[15674.31s -> 15675.83s]  but you're not even eating it.
[15675.83s -> 15676.67s]  They'll get it.
[15676.67s -> 15691.90s]  Maybe like 10, maybe 20.
[15691.90s -> 15694.88s]  This one is probably the best.
[15694.88s -> 15704.92s]  I'm just looking for experience.
[15704.92s -> 15708.86s]  I did not just say that I think that Beyond burgers
[15708.86s -> 15710.10s]  are better than real meat.
[15710.10s -> 15711.36s]  I didn't say that.
[15711.36s -> 15712.48s]  I said they're getting close
[15712.48s -> 15714.20s]  and they might be there in 10 to 20 years,
[15714.20s -> 15727.62s]  which they probably will be.
[15727.62s -> 15732.09s]  I mean that experience.
[15732.09s -> 15735.50s]  Did you say that Beyond was better than Impossible?
[15735.50s -> 15744.93s]  Yes.
[15744.93s -> 15747.49s]  And do you know that I'm not making this up?
[15747.49s -> 15750.42s]  You know that I'm telling you the truth
[15750.42s -> 15753.36s]  because I lost a shitload of money
[15753.36s -> 15755.88s]  buying puts on Beyond Meat,
[15755.88s -> 15757.96s]  like four and a half years ago
[15757.96s -> 15760.90s]  when they went into like IPO.
[15760.90s -> 15767.61s]  You know that I'm not bullshitting you here.
[15767.61s -> 15768.81s]  We all know that story.
[15768.81s -> 15781.14s]  So like I think it's a better product than Impossible.
[15781.14s -> 15782.30s]  Buying puts, Omega Low.
[15782.30s -> 15784.18s]  This was like four years ago.
[15784.18s -> 15792.13s]  This wasn't like last weekend.
[15792.13s -> 15793.51s]  I just didn't think that Beyond Meat
[15793.51s -> 15796.93s]  should have the valuation of like all the airlines
[15796.93s -> 15798.93s]  and every car company in America.
[15798.93s -> 15799.77s]  I'm sorry.
[15799.77s -> 15800.61s]  I just, it was crazy.
[15800.61s -> 15809.42s]  It was insane.
[15809.42s -> 15811.06s]  He shorted Beyond Meat, Omega.
[15811.06s -> 15811.90s]  Yeah, I did.
[15811.90s -> 15813.46s]  I, I, you know that.
[15813.46s -> 15819.12s]  I've been very transparent about that.
[15819.12s -> 15820.52s]  Back when it first came out,
[15820.52s -> 15823.64s]  it went up to like almost $300 a share.
[15823.64s -> 15836.02s]  And I was like, this is, what the hell is this?
[15836.02s -> 15837.72s]  And I got burned real bad.
[15837.72s -> 15840.96s]  And I, you know what they say?
[15840.96s -> 15848.51s]  You may have learned your lesson.
[15848.51s -> 15849.95s]  Remember you're wasting our sub money.
[15849.95s -> 15852.86s]  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
[15852.86s -> 15855.91s]  That was actually YouTube money.
[15855.91s -> 15859.59s]  That was before I made anything on Twitch.
[15859.59s -> 15861.79s]  That was back in like 2015, 2016.
[15861.79s -> 15862.63s]  That wasn't Twitch money.
[15862.63s -> 15868.19s]  That was YouTube money.
[15868.19s -> 15876.96s]  Wasn't your, that wasn't what you guys, come on.
[15876.96s -> 15879.64s]  Six years ago.
[15879.64s -> 15883.26s]  Whatever it was, I don't know.
[15883.26s -> 15893.04s]  Yeah.
[15896.46s -> 15898.82s]  It also was not very much.
[15898.82s -> 15902.24s]  A lot of you guys are somehow assuming that I put like,
[15903.12s -> 15908.12s]  like $500 million on like a short on Beyond Meat.
[15908.88s -> 15911.48s]  No, that's, I wasn't, it was not even,
[15911.48s -> 15922.90s]  it was not, I was not very much money at all.
[15922.90s -> 15923.98s]  How do you like your eggs?
[15923.98s -> 15926.40s]  I like them over medium.
[15926.40s -> 15927.24s]  Not over easy.
[15927.24s -> 15928.12s]  They get all over the plate
[15928.12s -> 15930.40s]  and it ruins everything else that's on the plate.
[15930.40s -> 15934.34s]  If you have bacon, toast, ash browns, eggs,
[15934.34s -> 15937.56s]  and they're over easy, it just gets everywhere.
[15937.56s -> 15938.84s]  And then it gets all over your bacon,
[15938.84s -> 15941.02s]  all over your toast, all over your potatoes.
[15941.02s -> 15945.45s]  I want it to be separated.
[15945.45s -> 15947.43s]  I like a jammy yolk.
[15947.43s -> 15949.81s]  Doesn't get everywhere and it's good.
[15949.81s -> 15950.65s]  It's absolutely false.
[15950.65s -> 15951.73s]  No, it's not.
[15951.73s -> 15958.84s]  All right, I want, let me just beat this.
[15958.84s -> 15976.78s]  Over medium.
[15976.78s -> 15979.54s]  I want good pictures.
[15979.54s -> 15982.45s]  You don't even eat.
[15982.45s -> 15983.33s]  That's the whole point.
[15983.33s -> 15984.33s]  Yeah, maybe for you,
[15984.33s -> 15987.96s]  I like to have all my stuff separated.
[15987.96s -> 15991.58s]  There's one, I will make one exception.
[15991.58s -> 15993.62s]  What's that?
[15993.62s -> 15995.08s]  Is that a spider?
[15995.08s -> 15999.23s]  Ooh, that is a spider.
[15999.23s -> 16006.55s]  The only exception I make is corned beef hash.
[16006.55s -> 16010.17s]  So if you have corned beef hash
[16010.17s -> 16012.17s]  and you drop an over easy egg on top of it,
[16012.17s -> 16016.24s]  you let it sit on top and you break the yolk,
[16016.24s -> 16017.38s]  it gets really kind of,
[16017.38s -> 16021.26s]  you have to lay the egg right on top of the corned beef hash.
[16021.26s -> 16024.58s]  That's the only exception where I'll have an over easy egg.
[16024.58s -> 16027.50s]  And then it gets in there, but that's the point.
[16027.50s -> 16028.98s]  That was done intentionally.
[16028.98s -> 16032.24s]  It was done intentionally.
[16032.24s -> 16033.82s]  Having just regular over easy eggs,
[16033.82s -> 16035.42s]  unintentionally you get your shit everywhere.
[16035.42s -> 16040.93s]  I don't like that.
[16041.69s -> 16042.85s]  I need somebody to do something else.
[16042.85s -> 16044.74s]  I need an animal to do something.
[16044.74s -> 16046.04s]  These things are cute, I guess,
[16046.04s -> 16060.31s]  but I need you to do something cool.
[16060.31s -> 16069.18s]  Eat, eat that.
[16069.18s -> 16073.21s]  Good one, that's a good pick.
[16073.21s -> 16074.33s]  What's your favorite rom-com?
[16074.33s -> 16092.47s]  Is it you've got mail?
[16092.47s -> 16097.07s]  Got it.
[16097.07s -> 16099.69s]  You can do a little dance if you take pictures of me.
[16099.69s -> 16107.17s]  Okay.
[16107.17s -> 16109.89s]  I keep fucking missing those toucans.
[16109.89s -> 16111.81s]  I know, I was waiting for it to go.
[16111.81s -> 16121.28s]  I'm gonna restart.
[16121.28s -> 16122.28s]  You like Among Us?
[16122.28s -> 16132.37s]  No, no, I don't.
[16132.37s -> 16134.61s]  You know why I don't like Among Us?
[16134.61s -> 16136.21s]  Because I can't give you an opinion
[16136.21s -> 16138.25s]  if I do or don't like it.
[16138.25s -> 16142.24s]  I can't tell you because I've never played it.
[16142.24s -> 16143.48s]  Wait for the jump.
[16143.48s -> 16165.17s]  Got it.
[16165.17s -> 16165.99s]  Next game, please.
[16165.99s -> 16167.33s]  You've been playing the same level.
[16167.33s -> 16168.57s]  Yeah, that's Pokemon Snap.
[16168.57s -> 16170.89s]  I'm playing Pac-Man and like, I don't know.
[16181.84s -> 16188.18s]  I wanna take a picture of the woofer.
[16188.18s -> 16190.90s]  Eat that woofer, come on.
[16190.90s -> 16191.74s]  Eat it, please.
[16191.74s -> 16203.99s]  No, he's gonna be mad at me.
[16203.99s -> 16205.31s]  Pokemon Snap in real life.
[16205.31s -> 16217.03s]  I wanna do a bird watching stream if that counts.
[16217.03s -> 16219.70s]  That's a pretty cute photo.
[16220.58s -> 16221.42s]  I'm like eating the apple.
[16221.42s -> 16231.14s]  The apple's in his mouth.
[16231.14s -> 16234.02s]  And I wanted to have binoculars that had cameras in them.
[16234.02s -> 16236.42s]  So you could see what I see when I hold binoculars up.
[16236.42s -> 16249.46s]  It's like two, it's two cameras.
[16249.46s -> 16267.16s]  Go to a petting zoo.
[16267.16s -> 16268.00s]  What was it?
[16270.01s -> 16270.85s]  You're sweet.
[16270.85s -> 16272.29s]  Hope you have a good bird watching stream.
[16272.29s -> 16274.42s]  Oh, thank you.
[16274.42s -> 16275.94s]  That's a really nice of you to say.
[16275.94s -> 16285.04s]  Thank you.
[16285.04s -> 16286.68s]  All right, I got a three here.
[16286.68s -> 16288.48s]  Which is the best one in the, probably that one?
[16288.48s -> 16291.34s]  No, I mean, this is a horrible picture,
[16291.34s -> 16302.65s]  but it's definitely gonna be this one.
[16305.42s -> 16306.82s]  This is also a three.
[16306.82s -> 16308.78s]  The one I took originally is so much better,
[16308.78s -> 16310.26s]  but we'll do that one.
[16312.91s -> 16314.94s]  I have a new woofer.
[16314.94s -> 16317.22s]  I do, really?
[16317.22s -> 16320.58s]  Hmm.
[16320.58s -> 16329.47s]  Okay, that one's good.
[16329.47s -> 16338.28s]  All right, this should bring me to another level.
[16338.28s -> 16340.12s]  I urge people to dress up in bird costumes
[16340.12s -> 16342.20s]  and climb up the trees and act like they're real.
[16342.20s -> 16348.66s]  Nice work.
[16348.66s -> 16351.57s]  I mean, that's really funny.
[16351.57s -> 16355.90s]  But I would be putting somebody's life in danger
[16355.94s -> 16357.90s]  by having them have to go up in a really tall,
[16357.90s -> 16361.26s]  like 150 foot tall tree.
[16361.26s -> 16363.46s]  The thought is funny,
[16363.46s -> 16365.78s]  but I don't think anyone's gonna do that.
[16365.78s -> 16371.73s]  Nice work.
[16371.73s -> 16380.37s]  All right, did I finally level up?
[16380.37s -> 16390.11s]  Finally.
[16390.11s -> 16391.07s]  Yeah, this is definitely a level up.
[16391.07s -> 16401.73s]  It has to be.
[16401.73s -> 16406.24s]  That's a new one.
[16406.24s -> 16411.41s]  This is worse than Pokemon Go?
[16411.41s -> 16412.85s]  Well, I mean, the whole point of,
[16414.25s -> 16416.37s]  you don't battle, oh, I love snackies.
[16422.42s -> 16425.89s]  Level two, come on.
[16425.89s -> 16426.73s]  There we go.
[16426.73s -> 16427.89s]  All right, level two.
[16429.15s -> 16434.39s]  Open up a new zone.
[16434.39s -> 16436.51s]  By the way, thanks to the progress you made,
[16436.51s -> 16438.70s]  I've got something to report.
[16438.70s -> 16450.64s]  Here we are.
[16450.64s -> 16452.60s]  This game is good, if not greater than Pokemon Go.
[16452.60s -> 16460.18s]  People have been waiting, hold on.
[16460.18s -> 16462.28s]  Ha ha.
[16462.28s -> 16463.12s]  I can do it too.
[16474.81s -> 16483.19s]  Yeah, we got new islands.
[16483.19s -> 16485.27s]  One on this long, narrow island
[16485.27s -> 16489.66s]  and another offshore in the middle of the water.
[16489.66s -> 16492.46s]  What happened?
[16492.46s -> 16494.82s]  Never got to that spot offshore, did he?
[16494.82s -> 16496.87s]  This is gonna be amazing.
[16496.87s -> 16498.71s]  I'll let you decide what order you want to visit them in,
[16498.71s -> 16503.79s]  keep up the good work.
[16503.79s -> 16508.28s]  Why are you such a food snob, but you drink Huel, Omega Lo?
[16508.28s -> 16512.25s]  I'm not ordering Huel at a restaurant.
[16512.25s -> 16518.28s]  It would be very bizarre, now wouldn't it?
[16518.28s -> 16521.56s]  Free-dwelling Pokemon.
[16521.56s -> 16522.76s]  When that huge tree lit up,
[16522.76s -> 16524.32s]  I saw a bunch of Pokemon fly out of it,
[16524.32s -> 16531.95s]  but I couldn't tell what kind of Pokemon they were.
[16531.95s -> 16532.95s]  I took that one too.
[16535.70s -> 16536.86s]  Did I take this one?
[16536.86s -> 16540.30s]  No, that's not even mine.
[16540.30s -> 16544.69s]  All right, new zone.
[16544.69s -> 16545.53s]  How's it going?
[16545.53s -> 16547.61s]  Enjoying your research jaunts?
[16547.61s -> 16548.57s]  Listen, I've got to tell you something.
[16548.57s -> 16549.89s]  There's a feature I originally forgot
[16549.89s -> 16551.94s]  to suggest to the professor.
[16551.98s -> 16556.49s]  But I got him to add it to your research camera.
[16556.49s -> 16558.89s]  It's a melody player.
[16558.89s -> 16563.02s]  It lets your camera play a little tune.
[16563.02s -> 16566.94s]  A little magical tune can prompt Pokemon
[16566.94s -> 16570.25s]  to show you whole new sides of themselves.
[16570.25s -> 16571.49s]  Sounds awesome.
[16571.49s -> 16574.42s]  Could you fill in the details?
[16574.42s -> 16575.50s]  Sure thing.
[16575.50s -> 16579.38s]  If you press R, a melody will play.
[16579.38s -> 16581.14s]  Medium well Huel.
[16581.14s -> 16583.24s]  I left it in the sun for an hour.
[16583.24s -> 16586.06s]  While it's playing, you can press R again to make it stop.
[16586.06s -> 16587.94s]  A little music could wake up sleeping Pokemon.
[16587.94s -> 16589.78s]  Ooh, the Peter Griffin character.
[16589.78s -> 16591.06s]  I want to go use it on.
[16591.06s -> 16593.22s]  Or make some Pokemon get up and dance.
[16593.22s -> 16594.34s]  I haven't had a chance to try it though,
[16594.34s -> 16596.66s]  so I'm no expert yet.
[16596.66s -> 16603.72s]  Next, let's give it a whirl.
[16603.72s -> 16605.12s]  The game just opened wide up.
[16611.00s -> 16612.44s]  First, let me go use this on Peter Griffin.
[16612.44s -> 16614.15s]  Where was he?
[16614.15s -> 16615.15s]  Where was Peter Griffin?
[16615.15s -> 16618.60s]  Jungle?
[16618.60s -> 16620.56s]  Where was Peter Griffin here?
[16620.56s -> 16637.59s]  What was the jungle during the day?
[16637.59s -> 16649.75s]  See if we can get him to dance.
[16649.75s -> 16658.86s]  Oh, play the tune.
[16658.86s -> 16669.88s]  Dance, I want to dance.
[16669.88s -> 16677.36s]  This better work on Peter Griffin.
[16677.36s -> 16683.93s]  Watch out, watch out, watch out.
[16683.93s -> 16687.39s]  He hates it.
[16687.39s -> 16688.79s]  Okay.
[16688.79s -> 16696.09s]  All right, Peter, get up.
[16696.09s -> 16700.14s]  Really?
[16700.14s -> 16703.14s]  What?
[16703.14s -> 16710.28s]  That's stupid, why does he not get up?
[16710.28s -> 16717.22s]  I hear Bugleberry.
[16717.22s -> 16732.72s]  He's scared of the snake.
[16732.72s -> 16744.09s]  Ooh, you gonna dance?
[16744.09s -> 16758.31s]  I think this is a prank.
[16758.31s -> 16763.48s]  He's dancing?
[16763.48s -> 16765.56s]  He just looked like Stuart Griffin.
[16765.56s -> 16766.48s]  He just did.
[16766.48s -> 16773.61s]  It looks like it's Stuart Griffin in a costume.
[16773.61s -> 16778.30s]  It sounds like an ice cream truck, it kind of does.
[16778.34s -> 16779.78s]  Wooden dog toy now.
[16779.78s -> 16786.81s]  Just wait until I go to Pac-Man.
[16786.81s -> 16787.65s]  Did I get it?
[16787.65s -> 16794.97s]  That was cool.
[16794.97s -> 16796.21s]  Oh, hold on.
[16796.21s -> 16806.74s]  I need to do this.
[16806.74s -> 16811.21s]  Come on, I have to get it.
[16811.21s -> 16812.58s]  Did I get him?
[16812.58s -> 16815.42s]  I got it.
[16815.42s -> 16819.79s]  Hold on, does he come back?
[16819.79s -> 16827.99s]  Did I get it?
[16827.99s -> 16828.83s]  Oh, what's he got?
[16828.83s -> 16829.98s]  He's got something.
[16829.98s -> 16834.96s]  That little guy had something, what was that?
[16834.96s -> 16854.69s]  He had like a little sack.
[16854.69s -> 16864.58s]  I don't think this does anything.
[16864.58s -> 16874.22s]  Oh brother, this guy stinks.
[16874.22s -> 16879.99s]  Wait, look at them walking together.
[16880.03s -> 16882.38s]  Did I get him jumping?
[16882.38s -> 16883.22s]  That was cool.
[16883.22s -> 16892.77s]  Okay, he's gonna do his jump now.
[16892.77s -> 16910.03s]  Oh, snackies.
[16910.03s -> 16919.02s]  Okay, I think I got it.
[16919.02s -> 16920.38s]  I wanna go to the new area
[16920.38s -> 16923.21s]  and then I'll play Pac-Man, I promise.
[16923.21s -> 16925.21s]  I wanna see the new two new areas
[16925.21s -> 16929.92s]  and then I'm gonna play, get a few photos of each area.
[16929.92s -> 16932.74s]  Then I'm going to go,
[16932.74s -> 16935.62s]  go get the wooden toy to smell it in front of you.
[16935.62s -> 16947.02s]  Then I'm gonna play Pac-Man 99.
[16947.02s -> 16947.94s]  This is awful.
[16947.94s -> 16953.29s]  I hated every second of it.
[16953.29s -> 16955.77s]  Oh, that's new when he's rolling around, okay.
[16955.77s -> 16957.58s]  What's the best one?
[16958.46s -> 16965.09s]  It's the only one you can see.
[16965.09s -> 16965.93s]  I like the angry one.
[16965.93s -> 16980.06s]  God damn it, I want Peter Griffin to turn around so bad.
[16980.06s -> 16982.86s]  This one's cute.
[16982.86s -> 16983.70s]  Yeah, look at that.
[16983.70s -> 16984.54s]  That's so cute.
[16987.30s -> 16993.20s]  I like that one.
[16993.20s -> 16998.54s]  I like that one.
[16998.54s -> 17008.73s]  I like, I like this one over here.
[17008.73s -> 17010.82s]  Oh, these are awful.
[17010.82s -> 17025.07s]  This one.
[17025.07s -> 17029.33s]  And that one.
[17029.33s -> 17033.21s]  And that one.
[17033.21s -> 17037.06s]  Analyze it, please.
[17037.06s -> 17040.57s]  I'm gonna do a three hour BRB.
[17040.57s -> 17054.36s]  How would I go BRB for three hours, I'm sorry about that.
[17056.51s -> 17064.55s]  I'm sorry, I didn't mean when I said you stink.
[17064.55s -> 17069.30s]  Hold, diamond.
[17069.30s -> 17074.38s]  Do a coloring stream?
[17074.38s -> 17075.62s]  Like a coloring book.
[17075.62s -> 17077.21s]  I already did that.
[17077.21s -> 17078.21s]  Didn't everybody hate that?
[17078.21s -> 17079.57s]  I did like a coloring book stream
[17079.57s -> 17081.45s]  and everybody hated it, did I?
[17081.45s -> 17083.05s]  No, that was, no, no, no, no, I didn't.
[17083.05s -> 17084.53s]  I did like the,
[17084.53s -> 17089.60s]  no, everybody loved the highlights stream.
[17089.60s -> 17092.36s]  I didn't do a coloring book, I did like an activity book.
[17092.36s -> 17102.58s]  Everybody loved that stream, that was a lot of fun.
[17102.58s -> 17104.46s]  Now that was the card game stream.
[17104.46s -> 17107.47s]  That's the worst stream I've ever done.
[17107.47s -> 17111.11s]  The unlocked stream is the worst stream I've ever done.
[17111.11s -> 17118.84s]  I would argue that you could not convince me otherwise.
[17118.84s -> 17120.68s]  You couldn't even read the text.
[17120.68s -> 17123.32s]  My webcam is so bad.
[17123.32s -> 17125.16s]  And it was just not even interesting at all.
[17125.16s -> 17128.98s]  It was very painfully uninteresting.
[17128.98s -> 17131.06s]  Karazhan stream, at least the Karazhan stream was funny
[17131.06s -> 17136.10s]  because I was getting shit on for like 12 hours.
[17136.10s -> 17141.10s]  The unlock card stream was not funny.
[17141.78s -> 17143.95s]  It was awful.
[17143.95s -> 17145.23s]  No, the wow stream was not worse
[17145.23s -> 17149.62s]  than the unlock card game stream.
[17149.62s -> 17150.66s]  After force was the worst.
[17150.66s -> 17151.50s]  No, it was not.
[17151.50s -> 17152.46s]  I had a lot of fun on that stream.
[17152.46s -> 17153.98s]  I love that game.
[17153.98s -> 17160.76s]  I disagree.
[17160.76s -> 17171.57s]  All right, new zone.
[17171.57s -> 17176.14s]  I get to level three, almost.
[17176.14s -> 17184.40s]  All right, I want to see the new zone.
[17184.40s -> 17189.30s]  More of the rocks was weird.
[17189.30s -> 17192.95s]  It was, wasn't it?
[17192.95s -> 17194.47s]  First stream yet.
[17194.47s -> 17197.03s]  Ooh, this is in the desert.
[17197.03s -> 17198.80s]  Check this place out.
[17198.80s -> 17200.36s]  I just want to check out the two new zones
[17200.36s -> 17201.44s]  and then I'm going to go take a break.
[17201.52s -> 17214.87s]  Get the wood and then we'll play Pac-Man 99 for a while.
[17214.87s -> 17219.92s]  We got new shit.
[17219.92s -> 17227.14s]  Do you not like that?
[17227.14s -> 17228.26s]  There's just new stuff everywhere.
[17228.26s -> 17237.43s]  This is awesome.
[17237.43s -> 17242.38s]  Some tracks left by a small Pokemon.
[17242.38s -> 17245.09s]  What is that?
[17245.09s -> 17249.80s]  You eat?
[17249.80s -> 17257.64s]  Whoa, what are you doing, dude?
[17257.64s -> 17258.86s]  Come here.
[17258.86s -> 17265.55s]  You dance?
[17265.55s -> 17266.71s]  That's a good picture.
[17266.71s -> 17268.71s]  Shit, why would I take the camera away?
[17268.71s -> 17276.26s]  What am I, stupid?
[17276.26s -> 17282.53s]  That was cool.
[17282.53s -> 17283.49s]  Okay, I'll be honest.
[17283.49s -> 17287.29s]  I feel like I'm playing Five Nights at Freddy's.
[17288.13s -> 17289.25s]  I feel like I'm just changing and I have to do this.
[17289.25s -> 17290.53s]  I have to wind up the toy.
[17290.53s -> 17305.99s]  I have to go over here, take a photo, go to this one.
[17305.99s -> 17306.83s]  That was cool.
[17306.83s -> 17311.55s]  That was a good one.
[17311.55s -> 17314.70s]  I don't know, I can't.
[17314.70s -> 17320.78s]  Remember, you need to reload the gun.
[17320.78s -> 17322.06s]  This place is really open.
[17322.06s -> 17324.30s]  There's not a lot of places to hide.
[17324.30s -> 17327.22s]  Am I going up in a tornado?
[17327.22s -> 17328.26s]  Oh, no, no, no, okay.
[17328.26s -> 17334.00s]  I thought I was getting sucked up.
[17334.00s -> 17335.72s]  So cute.
[17335.72s -> 17349.58s]  So cute.
[17349.58s -> 17350.54s]  Did I get it?
[17350.54s -> 17358.54s]  I think so.
[17358.54s -> 17359.38s]  You want to eat?
[17359.38s -> 17364.87s]  Eat that.
[17364.87s -> 17375.16s]  Whoa, he burns it.
[17375.16s -> 17377.92s]  Ice cream truck.
[17377.96s -> 17381.99s]  You know, I watched a video not that long ago
[17381.99s -> 17385.82s]  of an ice cream truck dog compilation
[17385.82s -> 17388.46s]  with dogs just get in line
[17388.46s -> 17392.78s]  and like eat ice cream with the ice cream truck.
[17392.78s -> 17401.72s]  It was really cute.
[17401.72s -> 17402.56s]  Link it.
[17402.56s -> 17403.40s]  I can't link it.
[17403.40s -> 17410.26s]  I don't know where it even is.
[17410.26s -> 17413.06s]  How sad is your life that you'll watch that?
[17413.06s -> 17414.42s]  What?
[17414.42s -> 17416.06s]  It's just a cute video.
[17416.06s -> 17418.36s]  What the fuck?
[17418.36s -> 17425.28s]  What are you talking about?
[17425.28s -> 17426.12s]  I felt like, what?
[17426.12s -> 17428.72s]  If I'm like in a doctor's office waiting room or something,
[17429.20s -> 17433.32s]  I don't stay away from those like dog ice cream videos.
[17433.32s -> 17438.54s]  He's pissed.
[17438.54s -> 17439.74s]  Oh, he's going to eat.
[17439.74s -> 17452.90s]  You're not too mad to like not eat.
[17452.90s -> 17455.46s]  You can turn quickly with the D pad.
[17455.46s -> 17459.18s]  Oh, well, that's about five hours worth of gameplay
[17459.18s -> 17461.22s]  that I did not play correctly.
[17481.02s -> 17481.86s]  That was cool.
[17481.86s -> 17486.81s]  I like that area.
[17486.81s -> 17490.85s]  This is probably the best one.
[17496.14s -> 17500.70s]  Pacing the apple, eating the apple.
[17500.70s -> 17502.06s]  No, definitely the happy one.
[17502.06s -> 17506.17s]  I like that one.
[17506.25s -> 17516.42s]  There's one where he's right in the camera.
[17516.42s -> 17523.28s]  Hmm, that one.
[17523.28s -> 17525.24s]  Oh, this is a Vivillon.
[17525.24s -> 17531.72s]  It's a different version.
[17531.72s -> 17537.26s]  I didn't get a picture of it.
[17537.26s -> 17544.22s]  Ooh, that one.
[17544.22s -> 17549.44s]  And the one when he's opening the mouth.
[17549.44s -> 17553.92s]  That one's good too though.
[17553.92s -> 17560.34s]  I don't know, that one looks like Bowser.
[17560.34s -> 17562.66s]  I'm going to say this one.
[17562.66s -> 17567.17s]  No, this one.
[17567.17s -> 17577.21s]  All right, go.
[17577.21s -> 17579.41s]  I wish I could see high resolution versions of them
[17579.41s -> 17580.94s]  before I pick them.
[17580.94s -> 17582.18s]  You pick kind of like a shitty version
[17582.18s -> 17591.95s]  before you get to see what it actually looks like.
[17591.95s -> 17596.81s]  I like that one.
[17597.65s -> 17599.05s]  What's a perfect score?
[17599.05s -> 17608.44s]  What do you know?
[17608.44s -> 17614.18s]  6,000, 7,000?
[17614.18s -> 17616.72s]  Like 1,000, toilet, thank you.
[17616.72s -> 17617.64s]  No, it's not.
[17617.64s -> 17618.48s]  That was wrong.
[17618.48s -> 17627.22s]  It's like 6,000.
[17627.22s -> 17628.22s]  6K is perfect.
[17633.10s -> 17634.10s]  I hate the original.
[17642.17s -> 17643.25s]  This is a boring baby game.
[17643.25s -> 17647.24s]  Please play Escape from Tarkov.
[17647.24s -> 17649.12s]  I would rather eat a rare steak
[17649.12s -> 17665.95s]  than play Escape from Tarkov.
[17665.95s -> 17668.99s]  You guys, who were the naysayers that said
[17668.99s -> 17670.59s]  that this was not a good photo?
[17670.59s -> 17675.24s]  That's a, I got diamonds.
[17675.24s -> 17684.83s]  Poor chick.
[17684.83s -> 17686.99s]  What's wrong with Escape from Tarkov?
[17686.99s -> 17688.34s]  Nothing.
[17688.34s -> 17690.50s]  Just don't want to play it.
[17690.50s -> 17692.30s]  If you presented me two options,
[17692.30s -> 17694.14s]  you have to either play Tarkov for an hour
[17694.14s -> 17695.30s]  or eat a rare steak.
[17695.30s -> 17698.00s]  I would eat the steak on camera right now.
[17698.00s -> 17699.00s]  I have nothing against Tarkov.
[17699.00s -> 17701.20s]  I just don't, I just do not want to play that.
[17701.20s -> 17708.37s]  I don't want to play that right now.
[17708.37s -> 17724.94s]  All right, what's the other place?
[17724.94s -> 17729.88s]  I think you're a really bad streamer.
[17729.88s -> 17730.70s]  You're terrible.
[17730.70s -> 17731.54s]  I hate you.
[17731.54s -> 17733.00s]  You're boring and lame and dumb and bad.
[17733.00s -> 17733.84s]  Not funny.
[17733.84s -> 17734.72s]  I went to middle school with you.
[17734.72s -> 17737.04s]  You were cool then, but not now.
[17737.04s -> 17740.91s]  I peaked at middle school.
[17744.65s -> 17747.99s]  How do you peak in middle school?
[17747.99s -> 17748.83s]  I don't understand that.
[17748.83s -> 17761.90s]  This is the beach.
[17761.90s -> 17767.06s]  Ooh, I like this place.
[17767.06s -> 17773.29s]  Ooh, I really like this place.
[17773.29s -> 17775.92s]  Like apples?
[17775.92s -> 17783.24s]  He's got boxing gloves.
[17783.24s -> 17795.46s]  Do something weird.
[17795.46s -> 17800.26s]  I don't know why that,
[17800.26s -> 17805.64s]  this looks like Patrick on drugs.
[17805.64s -> 17807.80s]  This is like crack Patrick.
[17807.80s -> 17808.84s]  I don't know why I think that.
[17808.84s -> 17810.44s]  I don't know why I'm seeing that.
[17810.44s -> 17813.54s]  What is that?
[17813.54s -> 17820.97s]  What the hell is that thing?
[17820.97s -> 17823.72s]  Whoa.
[17829.00s -> 17850.80s]  Oh my God.
[17850.80s -> 17853.00s]  Sounds like you're the one that's on crack.
[17858.70s -> 17860.34s]  I can do it if I try hard enough.
[17871.08s -> 17883.22s]  It's kind of moving.
[17883.22s -> 17886.28s]  You don't have that much depth.
[17886.28s -> 17897.30s]  What are you talking about?
[17897.30s -> 17901.63s]  I never do that again?
[17901.63s -> 17904.03s]  I'm going to at least a hundred more times
[17904.03s -> 17909.01s]  before my career ends.
[17909.01s -> 17910.61s]  Hey, if my career ends tomorrow,
[17910.61s -> 17912.29s]  if my career ended tomorrow,
[17912.29s -> 17913.37s]  I would upload a Twitter video
[17913.37s -> 17916.12s]  of me doing that a hundred times.
[17916.12s -> 17924.48s]  He's holding up middle fingers.
[17924.48s -> 17928.69s]  These things are cute.
[17928.69s -> 17929.53s]  How do you say this?
[17929.53s -> 17932.50s]  Piu-ku, Piu-ku-mu-ku.
[17932.50s -> 17939.77s]  Piu-ku-mu-ku?
[17939.77s -> 17940.73s]  You're going to fight over the,
[17940.73s -> 17945.10s]  what the hell?
[17945.10s -> 17956.88s]  That was weird.
[17956.88s -> 17963.40s]  That wasn't bad.
[17963.40s -> 17967.01s]  Or Sola?
[17967.01s -> 17972.52s]  You like apples.
[17972.52s -> 17973.36s]  All right.
[17973.36s -> 17984.26s]  Now you're going to do a funny little dance.
[17984.26s -> 17995.34s]  I don't know why I feel like it's going to take off.
[17995.34s -> 17996.18s]  What the?
[17996.18s -> 17997.14s]  What is that thing?
[17997.14s -> 17997.98s]  That's a Pokemon?
[17997.98s -> 18011.56s]  I thought that was an NPC.
[18011.56s -> 18017.59s]  I want to eat that apple.
[18017.59s -> 18019.62s]  No.
[18019.62s -> 18024.28s]  He's gone.
[18024.28s -> 18027.53s]  Pikachu, turn around here.
[18027.53s -> 18029.64s]  Pikachu.
[18029.64s -> 18030.48s]  Pikachu, look over here.
[18030.48s -> 18033.39s]  Look.
[18033.39s -> 18042.17s]  Pikachu, look.
[18042.17s -> 18046.96s]  Okay.
[18046.96s -> 18048.82s]  Dance.
[18048.82s -> 18054.88s]  You like to dance?
[18054.88s -> 18060.39s]  That was a Chad raw steak eater.
[18060.39s -> 18071.44s]  Chad real diarrhea haver.
[18071.44s -> 18077.40s]  These guys eat apples or anything?
[18077.40s -> 18085.05s]  That's cool.
[18085.05s -> 18086.83s]  I only have seven photos left.
[18086.83s -> 18096.89s]  Oh, well I'm done anyways, okay.
[18096.89s -> 18100.57s]  At somebody, you told me this guy was funny.
[18100.57s -> 18103.44s]  Oh no.
[18103.44s -> 18108.68s]  Oh no.
[18108.68s -> 18112.93s]  Did I just ruin a friend circle?
[18112.93s -> 18113.93s]  Used to be.
[18113.93s -> 18114.93s]  Get out of here.
[18114.93s -> 18115.77s]  I'm still funny.
[18115.77s -> 18119.43s]  I still got it.
[18119.43s -> 18121.19s]  Hey, dude, you told me this guy was funny.
[18121.19s -> 18126.12s]  What the fuck, dude?
[18126.12s -> 18130.28s]  Cartoon steam just came out of that guy's fucking neck
[18130.28s -> 18133.93s]  underneath his shirt.
[18133.93s -> 18134.77s]  I like that one.
[18134.77s -> 18138.16s]  There's a better one though.
[18138.16s -> 18139.00s]  How was it?
[18139.00s -> 18146.56s]  I guess I'll take it.
[18146.56s -> 18152.38s]  That one.
[18152.38s -> 18155.32s]  Guess I got a picture of that.
[18155.32s -> 18156.92s]  Definitely the one with the hand.
[18156.92s -> 18165.32s]  Definitely the one with the big flop.
[18165.32s -> 18169.10s]  Are we this one?
[18169.10s -> 18190.52s]  I got him from far away.
[18190.52s -> 18191.52s]  That's a good one.
[18197.20s -> 18198.08s]  All right, I'm gonna take a break.
[18198.08s -> 18200.68s]  I'm gonna go get the wood.
[18200.68s -> 18201.88s]  I'm gonna come back.
[18201.88s -> 18206.96s]  I'm gonna play Pac-Man 99 for a little while.
[18206.96s -> 18208.80s]  And then I will say goodbye.
[18208.80s -> 18214.92s]  I will say farewell.
[18214.92s -> 18216.76s]  I will play a lot of Pac-Man 99.
[18216.76s -> 18220.75s]  I'll try to get at least in the top 10.
[18220.75s -> 18224.16s]  And we'll look at the wood.
[18224.16s -> 18230.12s]  Okay, you want my review of Pokemon Snap?
[18230.12s -> 18231.74s]  It's cute.
[18231.74s -> 18237.22s]  That was a cute game.
[18237.22s -> 18240.34s]  Looks like there's a lot to do.
[18240.34s -> 18242.10s]  Looks like there's a lot of things to see.
[18242.14s -> 18245.64s]  A lot of completionists will love it
[18245.64s -> 18251.94s]  if they like Pokemon.
[18251.94s -> 18253.18s]  I enjoyed it.
[18253.18s -> 18255.53s]  I thought it was very fun.
[18255.53s -> 18258.42s]  But I don't know who any of these people are.
[18258.42s -> 18261.90s]  I'm your friend that came over in the middle of the season
[18261.90s -> 18262.94s]  that has not seen the show,
